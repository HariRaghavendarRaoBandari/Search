on planet migration and formation

ABSTRACT

The temperature and density proﬁles of protoplanetary discs depend crucially on the mass fraction of micrometre-sized dust grains
and on their chemical composition. A larger abundance of micrometre-sized grains leads to an overall heating of the disc, so that the
water ice line moves further away from the star. An increase in the water fraction inside the disc, maintaining a ﬁxed dust abundance,
increases the temperature in the icy regions of the disc and lowers the temperature in the inner regions. Discs with a larger silicate
fraction have the opposite eﬀect. Here we explore the consequence of the dust composition and abundance for the formation and
migration of planets. We ﬁnd that discs with low water content can only sustain outwards migration for planets up to 4 Earth masses,
while outwards migration in discs with a larger water content persists up to 8 Earth masses in the late stages of the disc evolution. Icy
planetary cores that do not reach run-away gas accretion can thus migrate to orbits close to the host star if the water abundance is low.
Our results imply that hot and warm super-Earths found in exoplanet surveys could have formed beyond the ice line and thus contain
a signiﬁcant fraction in water. These water-rich super-Earths should orbit primarily around stars with a low oxygen abundance, where
a low oxygen abundance is caused by either a low water-to-silicate ratio or by overall low metallicity.

Key words. accretion, accretion discs – planets and satellites: formation – protoplanetary discs – planet-disc interactions

1. Introduction

The birth environment for planets is the protoplanetary disc that
surrounds newly born stars. Planetary cores must form within
a few million years, the typical lifetime of protoplanetary discs
(Hartmann et al. 1998; Haisch et al. 2001; Mamajek 2009), in
order to attract a gaseous envelope. Planets with gaseous en-
velope can roughly be divided into three categories. Gas gi-
ants have a mass budget that is dominated by the gaseous enve-
lope, while the ice giants residing beyond the ice line are core-
dominated and accrete only a minor amount of gas. The third
category of planets with gas envelopes consists of hot and warm
super-Earths orbiting close to their host star. Super-Earths with
masses above 5 MEarth have large radii, consistent with a signif-
icant gaseous envelope (Weiss & Marcy 2014). The densities of
smaller super-Earths are more similar to silicate rock (Weiss &
Marcy 2014), although the masses of such small planets are hard
to measure precisely. Also, photoevaporation could play a signif-
icant role in depleting the primordial envelope of small planets
in very hot orbits (Owen & Jackson 2012). In contrast, the terres-
trial planets in the solar system are believed to have formed after
the dissipation of the gaseous disc (Kleine et al. 2009; Jacobson
et al. 2014). Nevertheless, the dominant part of the total mass of
a planetary system must be assembled during the gaseous disc
phase, as proven by the prevalence of planets with gaseous en-
velopes.

The protoplanetary disc sets the conditions for the two dom-
inant physical processes that shape the ﬁnal architecture of plan-
etary systems, namely mass accretion and orbital migration.

ble aggregates of mm-cm sizes (Testi et al. 2014). These peb-
bles are accreted very eﬃciently by the growing planetary cores
(Ormel & Klahr 2010; Lambrechts & Johansen 2012; Morbidelli
& Nesvorny 2012). The largest cores perturb the orbits of the
smaller planetesimals and quench their ability to accrete peb-
bles, guaranteeing that the planetary system ends up with a few
massive planets rather than a multitude of embryos (Levison
et al. 2015). In a previous paper we considered detailed models
for the growth and migration of planets (Bitsch et al. 2015b),
based on radiative transfer models of evolving protoplanetary
discs (Bitsch et al. 2015a). Here we extend this model to con-
sider the eﬀect of the chemical composition of the dust on the
formation of planetary systems.

The chemical composition of an exoplanet envelope encodes
information about the location in the disc where the planet ac-
creted. In Madhusudhan et al. (2014a) the formation pathways
of hot Jupiters through disc migration are constrained by the
abundances of oxygen and carbon in their envelopes. They ﬁnd
that the known composition of hot Jupiter atmospheres, which
predominantly have a low oxygen abundance, indicates a disc-
free migration, meaning a change of semi-major axis induced
by gravitational perturbation from another planet or stellar com-
panion. The measurements of the envelope composition by tran-
sit spectroscopy is nevertheless complicated by the presence of
clouds and hazes in the upper envelope (Madhusudhan et al.
2014b; Crouzet et al. 2014; Sing et al. 2016).

Santos et al. (2015) considered instead the inﬂuence of the
host star metallicity on the composition of the orbiting super-
Earths. Direct measurement of the chemical abundance pattern
of the host star is more precise than the indirect measurement
of abundances in planetary envelopes. The data they collected
nevertheless does not allow for clear conclusions to be made for

the observed systems, but future analysis combining host star
abundances, mass and radius measurements and internal struc-
ture models of planets can permit a better characterization of
exoplanet interiors and thus their formation.

In this paper we take a complementary approach to Santos
et al. (2015) and consider the eﬀect of the chemical composition
on the formation and migration of planets. We focus on the role
of oxygen and silicon, as well as the overall metallicity of the
star. Oxygen and silicon are both alpha elements and are thus
enriched by stellar nucleosynthesis roughly following the same
pattern. Nevertheless, at any given metallicity, signiﬁcant vari-
ations have been observed in the ratio of silicon to oxygen be-
tween individual stars (Bensby et al. 2014).

The opacity of the protoplanetary disc is dominated by water
ice and silicate grains. We assume that these two components are
in a 1:1 ratio in our previous papers (Bitsch et al. 2015a,b). Here
we expand on this approach and probe the inﬂuence of diﬀerent
water-to-silicate ratios on the disc structure and on planet forma-
tion and migration. As the opacity changes due to the chemical
composition, it directly inﬂuence the cooling rate and therefore
the temperature proﬁle of the disc. The temperature proﬁle in
turn aﬀects both the pebble accretion rates, as lower temperature
leads to thinner particle mid-plane layers and increased accre-
tion, and planetary migration, as the radial temperature and en-
tropy gradients determines both the magnitude and the sign of
type I migration (Paardekooper et al. 2011).

We ﬁnd that the migration of icy planetary cores to the in-
ner regions of the protoplanetary disc is facilitated in discs with
a low water content, as this decreases the temperature gradient
near the ice line and thus shrinks the parameter space for out-
wards migration. A similar result is found for discs with an in-
trinsically low abundance of small dust grains. Our model thus
predicts that water-rich super-Earths orbiting close to their host
stars should primarily be found in stars that have a low oxygen
abundance.

Our work is structured as follows. In section 2 we discuss the
methods used to calculate the disc structure and explain our used
opacity model for discs with diﬀerent water-to-silicate ratios. In
section 3 the inﬂuence of the water-to-silicate ratio on the disc
structure and on planet migration is described. The growth of
planetary seeds to planets as a function of the water-to-silicate
ratio and the total dust content Zdust is discussed in section 4. We
then discuss the inﬂuences and implications of the disc struc-
ture on planet formation in section 5. We ﬁnally summarize in
section 6.

2. Methods

2.1. Discevolution

During the gas phase of the disc, micrometre-sized dust grows
through several stages to form planetary cores. This growth over
many orders of magnitude in size and mass is directly inﬂuenced
by the structure of the protoplanetary disc. Dust particles grow to
pebbles by coagulation and ice condensation (Zsom et al. 2010;
Birnstiel et al. 2012; Ros & Johansen 2013) and drift towards
the star due to gas drag (Weidenschilling 1977; Brauer et al.
2008). The pebbles then concentrate in the turbulent gas and
form planetesimals by their mutual gravity, for example through
the streaming instability (Youdin & Goodman 2005; Johansen &
Youdin 2007). These planetesimals then accrete pebbles (Lam-
brechts & Johansen 2012) and form planetary cores, which ﬁ-
nally accrete gas in order to form giant planets (Pollack et al.
1996). During their growth, the planetary cores and planets mi-

grate through the disc due to gravitational interactions with the
gas (Ward 1997; Paardekooper & Mellema 2006; Kley & Crida
2008; Kley et al. 2009). As all these processes are dependent on
the underlying disc structure, it is therefore important to model
the structure as accurately as possible.

Recent simulations in 1D (Baillié et al. 2015) and 2D (Bitsch
et al. 2013, 2014; Bitsch et al. 2015a) pointed out the importance
of including both stellar and viscous heating as well as radiative
cooling to determine the disc structure in a self-consistent way.
The gas in the disc accretes onto the star with an accretion rate
˙M. This accretion rate changes in time (Hartmann et al. 1998)
and thus inﬂuences the structure of the disc. The mass ﬂux ˙M is
deﬁned as
˙M = −2πrΣgvr .
Here Σg is the gas surface density and vr the radial velocity. Fol-
lowing the α-viscosity approach of Shakura & Sunyaev (1973)
we can write this as

(1)

˙M = 3πνΣg = 3παH2ΩK ΣG .

(2)

Here H is the height of the disc and ΩK the Keplerian frequency
and we adopt a value of α = 0.0054. In our model α is used to
determine the heating and not the disc evolution, which is de-
termined through the ˙M-time relation of Hartmann et al. (1998).
The opacity plays here a crucial role, because it determines the
cooling of the disc. The opacity is discussed in detail in sec-
tion 2.2.

The magnetorotational instability can drive the viscosity in-
side the disc (Balbus & Hawley 1998). This instability drives
on the ionisation of atoms and molecules by cosmic and X-rays,
so the upper layers are much more easily ionised than the mid-
plane. This leads to an MRI non-active zone, the so-called dead
˙M,
zone, in the mid-plane of the disc. In discs with constant
a change of viscosity has to be compensated for by an equal
change in surface density, but 3D simulations have shown that
much of the accretion ﬂow can be carried through the upper lay-
ers, resulting in a less dramatic change of surface density com-
pared to ﬂat 2D discs (Bitsch et al. 2014). On top of that, hydro-
dynamical instabilities such as the baroclinic instability (Klahr
& Bodenheimer 2003) or the vertical shear instability (Nelson
et al. 2013; Stoll & Kley 2014) can act as a source of turbulence
in the weakly ionised disc mid-plane. As a realistic picture of the
source of turbulence in accretion discs is still under debate (see
e.g. Turner et al. 2014), we neglect the eﬀects of a dead zone and
assume a constant α throughout the disc in our simulations.

Recent simulations have also revealed that the disc’s ac-
cretion might be driven by disc winds (see above) in contrast
to viscous spreading (Bai & Stone 2013; Bai 2013; Bai et al.
2015). Already existing literature gives ﬁrst indications of how
disc winds act on the surface density proﬁle of the protoplane-
tary disc and how this inﬂuences planet migration and formation
(Ogihara et al. 2015a,b), but the simulations to constrain disc
winds are under constant development. However, we calculate
the disc structure only at given accretion rates, which we link
to time through observation (Hartmann et al. 1998), while disc
wind models require to simulate the evolution of the disc over
several Myr, which is too time demanding for full 2D simula-
tions. Diﬀerences in the scale height coming from diﬀerent disc
models have great inﬂuence on the underlying planet formation
model, as the scale height determines the pebble accretion rate
and the pebble isolation mass: the ﬁnal mass of the planetary
core. We discuss this in section 5.

2.2. Opacity

The opacity is the crucial parameter when calculating the disc
structure with heating and cooling, because the cooling rate F
is directly related to the Rosseland mean opacity (F ∝ 1/κR).
Additionally, the absorption of stellar photons is related to the
stellar opacity κ⋆. For more details see Bitsch et al. (2013).

The opacity at

low temperatures

is dominated by
micrometre-sized grains. Here we assume that only water
ice and silicate grains exist in the protoplanetary disc. However,
when the temperature becomes high enough, the water ice
grains sublimate, which reduces the opacity inside of the ice
line. In Fig. 1 the Rosseland mean opacities for three diﬀerent
water-to-silicate ratios are displayed. The grey region marks
the transition region at the water ice line. We investigate here 3
diﬀerent compositions of the disc:

– water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1
– water-to-silicate ratio of 1:1
– water-to-silicate ratio of 1:3

Changing the water-to-silicate ratio in a disc with a constant
abundance of heavy elements results therefore in a change of
the total abundance of silicate and water by the corresponding
factors. We assume that the contributions to the disc’s opacity
are only by water and silicates. So, if the water-to-silicate ra-
tio is 3:1, this means the disc has 75% of its heavy elements in
water and 25% in silicate. For a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:3, the
disc has 25% of its heavy elements in water and 75% in silicates.
The case of the water-to-silicate ratio of 1:1 was studied for the
disc structure in Bitsch et al. (2015a) and its inﬂuence on planet
formation in Bitsch et al. (2015b).

Evolution of chemical species in accretion discs is a very
complex topic that requires special codes that can deal with re-
action rates of molecules and how these reactions are aﬀected by
the molecular abundances, e.g. Heinzeller et al. (2011). In prin-
ciple, by changing the amount of certain elements in the disc,
their chemical reaction eﬃciencies change, leading to changes
in the abundances of the various volatile molecules. This could
in principle also change the underlying disc structure. However,
our model is much simpler and we do not take chemical reac-
tions between the molecules into account. Therefore the opacity
is set purely by the amount of available silicate and water grains.
The opacity is also inﬂuenced by the total amount of dust
grains inside the disc. We let Σdust denote the surface density of
heavy elements that are in µm size in condensed form. Therefore,
the metallicity Zdust is the ratio Zdust = Σdust/ΣG, assumed to be
independent of r in the disc. Our assumption is that the grains
are perfectly coupled to the gas, so the dust-to-gas ratio is the
same at every location in the disc. In this paper we consider two
diﬀerent cases with a dust metallicity of Zdust = 0.5% and Zdust =
0.1%.

The opacity is calculated using Mie-scattering theory from
optical constants from water ice (Warren & Brandt 2008) and
silicate dust (Jaeger et al. 1994; Dorschner et al. 1995). The ﬁ-
nal values of the Rosseland mean opacity are computed with the
opacity module of radmc-3d1. The diﬀerences in the opacity for
diﬀerent water-to-silicate fractions are then translated into diﬀer-
ences in the Bell & Lin (1994) opacity law, because the radmc-3d
opacity model does not account for gas opacities that dominate
at very high temperatures that are reached in the very inner and
upper layers of the disc.

Fig. 1. Rosseland mean opacity for micrometre-sized dust grains for
the diﬀerent water-to-silicate ratios. For low temperatures the discs with
more water have a larger opacity, because the reﬂection and absorption
parameters for water ice grains yield a higher opacity than for silicate
grains. At the water ice line (grey area) ice grains sublimate, causing a
drop in opacity. This drop is larger if the water fraction in the disc is
high. The opacity at higher temperatures is larger for discs with more
silicates, because more silicate grains are available that can contribute
to the opacity. The values of opacity here are calculated for a disc with
a total metallicity of Zdust = 0.5% in dust grains.

The absorption and emission features of water ice and sili-
cate grains are diﬀerent; water ice grains generate a larger opac-
ity than silicate grains. This is the reason why at low tempera-
tures (T < 160 K) the opacity is higher in the case of a larger
water fraction. More precisely, in the case of a water-to-silicate
ratio of 3:1, the opacity is 50% larger than for the 1:1 ratio, which
in turn has an opacity that is 50% larger compared to the water-
to-silicate ratio of 1:3.

At higher temperatures (T > 220 K) the water ice grains have
sublimated and the opacity drops. The drop in opacity is larger
for a larger water content in the disc and the resulting opacity
is smaller in this case. At these temperatures the only remaining
species is silicate, but it exists in diﬀerent quantities in the 3
diﬀerent set-ups, resulting therefore in diﬀerent opacities. In the
case of a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1, the opacity is 50% smaller
compare to the 1:1 ratio, which in turn has an opacity that is 50%
smaller than the water-to-silicate ratio of 1:3. In the transition
region, where water ice sublimates (160 K < T < 220 K, grey
band in Fig. 1), the opacity connects the two regimes, where we
assume that 50% of the water ice is evaporated when T = 190
K.

The stellar opacity κ⋆ in itself is dependent only the temper-
ature of the star, but not of the temperature inside the disc. How-
ever, when water ice sublimates also the stellar opacity changes,
because less dust is available to absorb or re-emit the stellar pho-
tons. The stellar opacity changes at the water ice line by exactly
the same factors as the Rosseland mean opacity.

2.3. Planetgrowthandmigration

In the core accretion scenario, the growth of planets can be
roughly divided into three stages:

1 http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/
software/radmc-3d/

1) the accretion of a core of at least a few Earth masses of solid

material

Article number, page 3 of 15

A&Aproofs: manuscript no. Iceline

2) subsequent contraction of a gaseous envelope until the mass
of the gas envelope Menv is as large as the mass of the solid
core Mcore

3) runaway gas accretion onto the planet, which allows the

planet to become a gas giant.

The building of the planetary core is strongly accelerated by ac-
cretion of pebbles onto an already existing planetary seed (Lam-
brechts & Johansen 2012). We follow here the planet growth
model laid out in detail in Lambrechts & Johansen (2014). The
used code that incorporates planet growth, planet migration and
disc evolution is presented in detail in Bitsch et al. (2015b).

The starting mass of our planetary seeds is at the pebble tran-

sition mass

Mt = r 1

where G is the gravitational constant, vK = ΩKr, and

where pebble accretion is terminated and the contraction of the
gaseous envelope can start. We use for the contraction of the
gaseous envelope the semi-analytical model described by Piso
& Youdin (2014), where the contraction phase becomes shorter
for more massive planetary cores. This contraction phase addi-
tionally depends on the opacity inside the of the planetary enve-
lope, as this determines the cooling and with this the contraction
rate of the envelope. Our nominal opacity in the envelope corre-
sponds to similar values as in Movshovitz & Podolak (2008). We
discuss the inﬂuence of a slower contraction rate in appendix. B.
As soon as Menv = Mcore, rapid gas accretion can start.

During the whole growth process, planets migrate through
the disc. In the initial state, when the planets are small and do
not open gaps in the disc, they migrate in type-I migration. We
implement this migration rate following the torque formula from
Paardekooper et al. (2011), which accounts also for the satura-
tion of the corotation torque. As the planets grow in the disc, they
can become massive enough to open a gap, which we determine
through the gap opening criteria (with ΣGap < 0.1Σg), when

PΩP/ν (Crida et al. 2006). When the plan-
ets open a gap, they transition into type-II migration, in which
planets follow the viscous evolution of the protoplanetary disc.
However, if the planet is much more massive than the gas out-
side the gap, it slows down the viscous accretion. This happens
if MP > 4πΣgr2

Here, ∂ ln P/∂ ln r is the radial pressure gradient in the disc. Note
that the planetesimals formed by the streaming instability are

The eﬃciency of pebble accretion is determined by the peb-

ble scale height in the disc given by

Hpeb = Hpα/τf ,

where τf is the Stokes number of the particles. If the planetary
seed’s Hill radius is larger than the pebble scale height, the plan-

where rH = r[Mc/(3M⋆)]1/3 is the Hill radius, vH = ΩKrH the

bers larger than 0.1, the (τf/0.1)2/3 term vanishes in eq. 6, be-
cause the planetary seed cannot accrete particles from outside its
Hill radius (Lambrechts & Johansen 2012). However for small
planetary seeds, the Hill sphere can be smaller than the pebble
scale height, so that the seed accretes in a slow 3D fashion

Clearly this transition depends on the scale height of the pebbles
and thus on the scale height of the gas. Therefore, pebble accre-
tion is slower in the initial planetary growth phase in the outer
parts of the disc, because the aspect ratio is larger there. The core
can then ﬁnally reach its pebble isolation mass (Lambrechts et al.

resulting in slower
inward migration for massive planets
(Baruteau et al. 2014). However, recent studies have challenged
the viscous type-II inward migration, showing a dependence on
the planetary mass and mass ﬂux (Dürmann & Kley 2015). This
might lead to the conclusion that the slowing down eﬀect of the
planet’s inertia on the disc accretion rate is too strong and the
real type-II migration rate should be faster. We discuss this in
appendix A.

3. Disc structure

We investigate here not only the inﬂuence of the diﬀerent water-
to-silicate ratios on the disc, but also the inﬂuence of the total
amount of dust Zdust on the disc structure. We therefore study
two values of the dust abundance, Zdust = 0.5% and Zdust = 0.1%.
To calculate the disc structure we use the 3D radiative hydrody-
namical code FARGOCA as presented ﬁrst in Lega et al. (2014),
using the set up of Bitsch et al. (2015a) in 2D with the opacity
modiﬁcations presented in section 2.2 to incorporate the diﬀer-
ent water-to-silicate ratios.

The change of opacity causes a change in the cooling of the
disc. In particular an increase in the Rosseland mean opacity κR
results in a decrease in cooling, allowing a higher temperature
of the disc. A higher temperature of the disc directly translates
to a larger aspect ratio H/r. This can be seen in Fig. 2, most
clearly in the top panel in the ˙M = 3.5 × 10−8M⊙/yr case, which
corresponds to a time evolution of 0.45 Myr. The larger the water
fraction in the disc is, the larger the bump in the aspect ratio at
∼ 3 AU, which corresponds to the opacity transition at the water
ice line rice.

Bitsch & Johansen: Inﬂuence of the water content in protoplanetary discs on planet migration and formation

Interior to rice, the water ice grains have sublimated and only
the silicate grains remain, which then dominate the opacity. A
lower water-to-silicate ratio therefore results in a higher opac-
ity. This in turn causes again a lower cooling rate, allowing for
higher temperatures. This can be seen clearly for the discs with
t = 0.45 Myr in the top panel of Fig. 2, where the disc with the
largest silicate content has the largest aspect ratio in the inner
disc (r < 2 AU).

In the outer parts of the disc, the disc structure is quite sim-
ilar for all diﬀerent water-to-silicate ratios. The heating of the
outer disc is provided by stellar irradiation, so a higher opacity
allows more eﬃcient absorption of stellar irradiation. However,
this means that at large orbital distances less stellar heating ar-
rives in discs with high opacity, because it is absorbed at smaller
orbital distances, which would result in a lower disc tempera-
ture compared to discs with lower opacity. But, the opacity has
an opposite eﬀect on cooling. A larger opacity results in a lower
cooling rate compared to a small opacity. These two eﬀects seem
to balance in the outer regions of the disc for the diﬀerent water-
to-silicate ratios, resulting in similar disc structures.
For the ˙M = 8.75 × 10−9M⊙/yr case, which correspond to an
evolution time of 1.1 Myr, the observed trend continues. The disc
with the largest water-to-silicate ratio features the largest aspect
ratio at the ice line (around 1 AU). The lower accretion rates
results in a reduction of the viscous heating. The consequence
is that the water ice line moves closer to the central star, and
with it the bump in the aspect ratio. For the outer disc, which is
dominated by stellar irradiation, again only minor diﬀerences are
visible in the structure between the discs with diﬀerent water-to-
silicate ratios. However, as the disc’s accretion rate decreases in
time, the disc with a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1 shows a smaller
aspect ratio in the outer parts, because the bump at the water ice
line shields the outer disc from stellar irradiation eﬃciently.

The simulations with a smaller dust content of Zdust = 0.1%
(bottom panel in Fig. 2) show the same trends for the water-to-
silicate ratios regarding the aspect ratio, mainly that discs with a
larger water fraction have a larger aspect ratio in the inner part of
the disc. Also for earlier disc evolution times, the aspect ratio in
the outer parts of the disc is very similar for the diﬀerent water-
to-silicate ratios.

However, at the late stages of the disc evolution clear diﬀer-
ences in the aspect ratio arise. As in the case of high Zdust, the
inner disc is able to shield the outer disc from stellar irradiation.
This eﬀect is more eﬃcient in discs with a higher opacity, so
in discs with a larger water-to-silicate fraction. This means less
stellar irradiation is absorbed by the outer disc, resulting in a
cooler disc. At the same time a higher opacity (larger water con-
tent in the disc) results in a smaller cooling rate compared to the
discs with a lower opacity (low water content). In the discs with
high metallicity (Zdust = 0.5%) these eﬀects are in balance, so
that the disc structure in the outer disc is the same for all water-
to-silicate ratios except for the late stages of the disc evolution.
However this balance is apparently broken for low metallicity
(Zdust = 0.1%), resulting in a lower aspect ratio for the disc with
the larger water content.

As in previous work (Bitsch et al. 2015a) we use the disc
evolution equation given by Hartmann et al. (1998) to have a
relation between ˙M and time. It is given by
log 
and it allows us to associate a time to a given ˙M value. As in
Bitsch et al. (2015a) we ﬁt the disc structure by an analytical

Fig. 2. Aspect ratio H/r for discs with diﬀerent water-to-silicate ratios.
The top plot shows H/r for a dust metallicity of Zdust = 0.5% , while the
bottom plot has Zdust = 0.1%. A larger fraction of water causes a larger
bump in the H/r proﬁle at the water ice line, as expected from the opac-
ity transition (see Fig. 1). At lower dust metallicities the bump at the
water ice line is less pronounced compared to higher dust metallicities
and resides close to or even inside of 1 AU at the late stages of the disc
evolution. For all water-to-silicate ratios, lower accretion rates ˙M result
in smaller H/r, because the disc is less massive and therefore produces
less viscous heating.

formula, which allows us to calculate the disc structure at any
given orbital distance for a given ˙M. We then use these ﬁts of
the disc structure with eq. 12 for our time evolving disc model
needed for the planet formation studies presented in section 4.

3.1. Inﬂuenceonplanetmigration

The changes of the disc structure aﬀect all stages of planet for-
mation. As shown in Bitsch et al. (2015b), planet migration is of
crucial importance, because the planetary seed must form much
further away from the star than compared to the ﬁnal orbital po-
sition of the planet. We therefore discuss here the inﬂuence of
the changed disc structure due to the diﬀerent water-to-silicate
ratios on planet migration.

Once planetary embryos have formed, they are subject to
planetary migration (see Baruteau et al. 2014 for a review). Mi-
gration rates can be computed by 2D or 3D simulations (Kley
et al. 2009; Bitsch & Kley 2011), however, such simulations
are quite computationally intensive. We therefore calculate the
torque on an embedded planet from the underlying disc structure

(Paardekooper et al. 2011), an approach which matches quite
well the results of 3D simulations (Bitsch & Kley 2011; Lega
et al. 2015). The torque acting on an embedded planet depends
crucially on the gradients of surface density and entropy, em-
phasizing the importance of the disc structure discussed in the
previous section. In Fig. 3 the regions of outward migration in
discs with Zdust = 0.5% and diﬀerent water-to-silicate ratios for
two given accretion rates ˙M are displayed.

At an evolution time of 0.5 Myr, two regions of outward mi-
gration exist except for the disc with a water-to-silicate ratio of
1:3. The outer region of outward migration is originating at the
water ice line, while the inner region of outward migration is
caused by the silicate evaporation line. When the silicate grains
evaporate, the opacity is determined by molecules. In the disc
that has the largest silicate fraction, the two regions of outward
migration are merged into one big region. The merging of the
two regions has its origin in the smaller bump in temperature
(and therefore H/r) at the water ice line (Fig. 2), which is too
small to cause a clear cut between the two regions of outward
migration. For this given accretion rate ˙M and time t, planets
with a minimum of 5 MEarth and a maximum of ∼ 40 MEarth can
migrate outwards close to the water ice line, independent of the
water-to-silicate ratio.

At an evolutionary time of 2 Myr, the water ice line is closer
to the star and with it the regions of outward migration (Bitsch
et al. 2014; Bitsch et al. 2015a). For the discs with water-to-
silicate ratio of 1:1 and 1:3 only one region of outward migra-
tion exists. This is caused by the fact that the bump at the water
ice line also shrinks as the accretion rate reduces, which then
in turn allows the two regions of outward migration to merge
together, as also seen at 0.5 Myr for the largest silicate frac-
tion in the disc. On the other hand, the large water content en-
hances the bump at the water ice line, separating the two re-
gions of outward migration. Additionally, at low accretion rates
the region of outward migration can now contain planets with
1MEarth < MP < 10MEarth. The changing of the regions of out-
ward migration with time has important consequences for the
growth tracks of planets (Bitsch et al. 2015b). We discuss this in
detail in section 4.

When the planets become so massive that they start opening
a gap in the disc, their migration rates start to diﬀer from the
pure type-I migration rate and the torque can no longer be cal-
culated by using the model of Paardekooper et al. (2011). When
the planet becomes massive enough to open a gap in the disc, it
migrates in type-II migration. In the intermediate mass region,
where planets have not fully opened a gap, yet, but only a partly
gap, a smoothing function for the migration speed is used to con-
nect these two migration regimes. The detailed methods how we
calculate the migration speeds and directions are described in
Bitsch et al. (2015b).

4. Planet growth

The planet growth and evolution model is described in detail in
Bitsch et al. (2015b) and in section 2.3. The only diﬀerence com-
pared to Bitsch et al. (2015b) is the underlying disc structure that
depends on the considered water-to-silicate ratio (section 3).

Fig. 3. Regions for outward migration in discs with diﬀerent water-to-
silicate ratios (Zdust = 0.5%) and diﬀerent times for planets in type-I-
migration. Planets located inside of the solid lines migrate outwards,
while planets outside the lines migrate inwards. As the disc evolves in
time, the strong negative gradients in entropy indicated by radial de-
creases in H/r (Fig. 2) move towards the star and thus the regions of
outward migration move inwards. The small ticks on the top of the plot
correspond to the location of the ice line for the diﬀerent simulations. A
clear diﬀerence in the regions of outward migration for the diﬀerent ice
to silicate ratios is visible for early times, while the diﬀerences become
smaller for late evolution times.

ticles in the disc is Zdust = 0.5%. The metallicity of pebbles is
ﬁxed to Z = 1.0%.

4.1.1. Single evolution tracks

We follow here the evolution tracks of single planetary seeds.
These seeds are put at diﬀerent orbital distances r0, but they all
start in their individual evolution at t0 = 2 Myr. As the ﬁnal life-
time of the disc is 3 Myr in our simulations, each planetary seed
is evolved for 1 Myr. In Fig. 4 the evolution tracks for planetary
seeds starting at 6, 15 and 25 AU in discs with a water-to-silicate
ratio of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3 are displayed.

The planetary seeds starting at 25 AU accrete pebbles quite
slowly, because the pebble surface density is low in the outer
disc. In the disc with a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:1 and 1:3, the
accretion is so slow that the planets do not even reach pebble
isolation mass. However, in the case of the water-to-silicate ra-
tio of 3:1, the planet reaches pebble isolation mass, contracts a
gaseous envelope and enters runaway gas accretion, where its
evolution is just stopped at the end of the discs lifetime when
the planet reaches ∼ 100MEarth. The reason why the planet in
the water-to-silicate 3:1 disc can reach a much higher planetary
mass compared to the planets in the other discs lies in the disc
structure.

In the disc with water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1, the aspect ratio
far out in the disc at late times (t > 2 Myr) is a bit smaller than
the 1:1 and 1:3 cases. A smaller aspect ratio increases the growth
of the planet, because

i) the particle sizes are larger, thus allowing a faster accretion
ii) the pebble scale height is smaller (eq. 5), allowing a faster

transition into the more eﬃcient 2D accretion regime

We investigate here the inﬂuence of the diﬀerent disc structures
caused by the diﬀerent water-to-silicate ratios on the formation
of planets. In this section the underlying metallicity in dust par-

However, the smaller aspect ratio reduces the pebble isolation
mass (eq. 9), so that planets in the disc with a water-to-silicate
ratio of 3:1 have smaller planetary cores. But here the mass of

Fig. 4. Growth tracks of planets that accrete pebbles in an evolving pro-
toplanetary disc. The planets are placed in discs with diﬀerent water-to-
silicate ratios at a disc evolution time of t0 = 2 Myr. The simulations
are stopped when t f = 3 Myr is reached, meaning the planet and disc
evolve for 1 Myr. Note that the diﬀerent resulting planetary masses and
orbital distances are a result of the diﬀerent underlying disc structures
(Fig. 2) and migration patters (Fig. 3).

the core is still suﬃciently high, allowing the contraction of a
gaseous envelope within a few 100 kyrs, so the planet can evolve
into a gas giant.

During their evolution, the planets starting at 25 AU that do
not reach pebble isolation mass stay in the outer disc where they
formed, while the planet formed in the disc with a water-to-
silicate ratio of 3:1 migrates down to ∼ 7 AU, because type-I
migration is faster for massive planets.
For the planetary seeds starting at 15 AU, a similar behaviour
can be observed. In the discs with a low water fraction the plan-
etary seeds reach pebble isolation mass, contract their gaseous
envelope and then become gas giants, while migrating into the
inner disc to ∼ 3 AU. The planet in the water rich disc reaches
pebble isolation mass faster than the counterparts in the water
poor discs, for the reasons stated above. But, again, its core is
then smaller but still large enough to attract a gaseous envelope
and go into runaway gas accretion. Because gas envelope con-
traction is slower than pebble accretion, it results in a horizontal
movement of the planet in the orbital distance - planetary mass
diagram (Fig. 4), which is not seen as strongly in the planets in
discs with water-to-silicate fraction of 1:1 and 1:3. Note that the
planet at that point is too massive to be trapped in a region of
outward migration (Fig. 3).

The planetary seeds starting at 6 AU show very diﬀerent evo-
lution tracks. These diﬀerences are caused by small diﬀerences
in the disc structure. For a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:1 and 1:3,
the planet reaches an isolation mass of roughly 3 Earth masses,
while it only reaches ∼ 2 Earth masses in a disc with water-
to-silicate ratio of 3:1. This leads to diﬀerent contraction times
of the gaseous envelope, which takes longer for the seed in the
disc with water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1. As the seed grows in this
disc its semi major axis evolution follows the evolution of the
zero-torque radius until the planet reaches runaway gas accre-
tion and outgrows the region of outward migration. At the end
of the disc’s lifetime the planet is stranded at ∼ 3.5 AU and its
composition is dominated by the gaseous envelope of roughly 20
Earth masses.

The seed in the disc with a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:1
reaches a higher pebble isolation mass and can thus contract its

envelope faster. During this evolution the planet is trapped in the
region of outward migration that stops its inward motion towards
the star. As the planet reaches runaway gas accretion it outgrows
the region of outward migration and moves inwards as it grows.
It is then stranded at ∼ 0.3 AU with roughly the size of Saturn.
The seed in the disc with a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:3 has a
similar size and could thus accrete a gaseous envelope in a sim-
ilar time, however as the region of outward migration can only
stop migration of smaller planets (see Fig. 3) it drifts into the
inner disc as a super-Earth planet and hits the inner edge of the
disc.

All these diﬀerences in ﬁnal orbital position and planetary
masses are a direct consequence of the diﬀerence in the disc
structure, even though these diﬀerences are actually quite small
(Fig. 2). As the disc evolves in time, we probe in the next section
diﬀerent initial times t0 when the planetary seed is placed in the
disc.

4.1.2. Growth maps

The growth tracks shown in Fig. 4 are for individual planets re-
leased at given orbital distances r0 and at an initial time t0. Here
we investigate the parameter space for planets starting with 3 AU
< r0 < 50 AU and with 100 kyr < t0 < 3 Myr. The whole disc
lifetime is ﬁxed to 3 Myr, meaning that planets that are starting
at a later time t0, only have a shorter time to grow and migrate
through the disc compared to planets that start at a smaller t0.

In Fig. 5 we show the ﬁnal planetary masses and orbital dis-
tances of planetary seeds that are put into a disc at a starting
time t0 and a starting orbital distance r0. Each planetary seed at a
given r0 and t0 value undergoes an evolution track like the ones
shown in Fig. 4. For example, the growth tracks shown in Fig. 4
have their r0 and t0 at the location of the white crosses in Fig. 5.
The top panel in Fig. 5 features a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1,
while the bottom panel features a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:3.
We do not display the r0-t0 map for planets evolving in the disc
with a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:1, because this is extensively
discussed in Bitsch et al. (2015b), see their Fig.4.

The general planet formation picture is quite similar for all

discs, no matter their water-to-silicate ratio:

– pebble accretion is eﬃcient enough that planets that form
early grow all the way to become gas giants, even at large
orbital distances

– gas giant planets experience a signiﬁcant reduction of their

semi-major axis due to planet migration

– planetary seeds emerging at the late stages of disc evolution
form also smaller planets (like super-Earths, ice giants and
ice planets)

However, there are a few diﬀerences between the two extremes
of high and low water content in the disc.

In the case of a high water content (3:1 water-to-silicate ra-
tio) giant planets can form at larger distances and later times
compared to the case of low water content (1:3 water-to-silicate
ratio). This is caused by the slightly lower H/r in the outer
disc, which reduces the particle scale height and therefore allows
faster pebble accretion (see the 25 AU growth track in Fig. 4). In
the late stages of the disc evolution (t > 2 Myr), the formed
planets are small in the inner disc (low core mass leads to a long
contraction time of the envelope) and follow the zero torque mi-
gration radius, when they reach it in the inner disc. In the case
of a higher water content, this zero torque radius is farther out
compared to a disc with low water content. Planetary seeds that

Fig. 5. Final masses of planets (MP = Mc + Menv) as a function of
initial radius r0 and initial time t0 in discs with a dust metallicity of
Zdust = 0.5%. The top plot features an water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1,
while the bottom plot features a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:3. Planets
that are below the dark blue line have reached pebble isolation mass
and can accrete gas. All planets that are inside the white lines have Mc <
Menv, indicating that they have underwent runaway gas accretion. The
yellow line marks the pebble production line; planets below the yellow
line can not have formed by pebble accretion, because the pebbles have
not yet formed at the insertion time of the planet, see Lambrechts &
Johansen (2014). The black lines indicate the ﬁnal orbital distance rf of
the planet. The white crosses indicate r0 and t0 for the evolution tracks
shown in Fig. 4.

form with t0 < 2 Myr in the disc with high water content end up
as gas giants.

However, if planets form in the disc with low water content,
the formation of small planets (up to a few Earth masses and
r f < 10 AU) is possible at nearly all initial times with t0 > 700
kyr. Interestingly in this case, these low mass planets can even
migrate all the way to the inner disc (r f < 1 AU), which is not
possible in the discs with high water content, where they are
trapped in the region of outward migration. Inside the disc with
low water content planets can outgrow the zero migration region
at a lower planetary mass, which allows them to migrate into
the inner disc, before they reach Menv ∼ Mcore and runaway gas
accretion starts. However, note that we stop our planet evolution
model as soon as the planet hits the inner edge of the disc at
0.1 AU, because planet growth (especially via gas accretion) is
unknown in these regions of the disc.

The small diﬀerence in the disc structure caused by the dif-
ferent water-to-silicate ratios (see Fig. 2) has important conse-
quences for the formation of planets. A low water-to-silicate ra-

tio allows low mass planets to migrate into the inner disc before
they can attract a gaseous envelope and grow to gas giants.

4.2. Lowdustcontent

The thermodynamical structure of the protoplanetary disc is not
only determined by the water-to-silicate ratio, but also by the
amount of dust grains inside the disc (see Fig. 2). In princi-
ple the amount of dust grains in the disc can change in time,
for example due to grain growth. However, larger grains do not
contribute to the opacity for most realistic size distributions, so
the opacity is reduced when grains grow. On the other hand,
the amount of micrometre-sized dust can increase, for example
through destructive collisions of larger dust aggregates and peb-
bles. As shown in Fig. 2, a smaller amount of dust grains results
in a colder disc, because the cooling rate increases (Bitsch et al.
2015a). We now investigate how planet formation is inﬂuenced
if the disc has a metallicity of dust particles of Zdust = 0.1%. In
particular we also investigate here the inﬂuence of the water-to-
silicate ratio.

In Fig. 6 we show the ﬁnal planetary masses and orbital dis-
tances of planetary seeds that are put into a disc at a starting

Bitsch & Johansen: Inﬂuence of the water content in protoplanetary discs on planet migration and formation

time t0 and a starting orbital distance r0, where the disc has
Zdust = 0.1%.

There are two main diﬀerences in the general outcomes com-
pared to the discs with Zdust = 0.5%, i) gas giants can be formed
farther out in the disc and at later times and ii) planetary seeds
placed at r0 < 20 AU and formed at t0 > 500 kyr only grow
to several Earth masses and end up in the inner disc (r f < 5
AU) unless they form very late (t0 > 2.5 Myr). The reason why
gas giants can be formed farther out in the disc is related to the
smaller H/r in discs with Zdust = 0.1% (Fig. 2). A smaller H/r
reduces the pebble scale height, which allows the transition from
3D to 2D pebble accretion at a lower planetary mass, hence in-
creasing the growth rate. Additionally to that, a smaller H/r also
increases the Stokes number τf of the pebbles, which in turn in-
creases the growth rate. However, a smaller H/r reduces the peb-
ble isolation mass (eq. 9), so that planetary cores are smaller in
the Zdust = 0.1% case compared to the Zdust = 0.5% case, but
nevertheless they are big enough to attract a gaseous envelope
within the lifetime of the disc.

In the inner disc, the aspect ratio H/r is also smaller, which
therefore results in a very low pebble isolation mass and hence
core mass. The cores then need a very long time to attract a
gaseous envelope. However, even before runaway gas accretion
can start at Menv ∼ Mcore the cores are too massive to be con-
tained in the regions of outward migration and migrate into the
inner disc for all water-to-silicate ratios.

As in the simulations with Zdust = 0.5%, there are also dif-
ferences in the resulting planetary masses and orbital distances
related to the water-to-silicate ratio in the disc. In the case of the
high water content, a larger region of r0-t0 parameter space al-
lows for the formation of small planets at 0.1 AU < rf < 0.5
AU. This region shrinks as the water content in the disc de-
creases. The planets in this region have a larger core and total
mass for discs with larger water content, because the pebble iso-
lation mass is higher in those discs. In addition to that, planets
need a higher mass to outgrow the region of outward migration
in discs with high water content to drift into the inner disc. As
the growth time is longer, the planets migrate less when they out-
grow the region of outward migration until the disc disperses, so
they do not migrate all the way close to the star with rf < 0.1 AU.
Additionally, a small region in parameter space (r0 ∼ 3 − 10 AU
and t0 ∼ 700 − 1500 kyr) exists where the planetary seeds grow
to become gas giants with masses around Saturn’s. This region
of parameter space also shrinks with decreasing water content in
the disc.

In the case of a low water-to-silicate ratio, the planets need
to grow less to outgrow the region of outward migration. There-
fore they have longer time to migrate until disc dispersal - thus
a smaller region of parameter space allows for the formation of
planets with 0.1 AU < rf < 0.5 AU, compared to discs with a
high water content.

5. Discussion

5.1. Discstructureandplanetmigration

The structure of the disc is determined in an equilibrium be-
tween heating and cooling, where the cooling function depends
on the opacity and thus on the chemical composition of the disc.
By changing the water-to-silicate ratio in the disc, the bump in
H/r at the water ice line created by the opacity transition there
changes as well. Reducing the water content in the disc reduces
the bump in H/r at the ice line. For very low ˙M values, the bump
at the ice line is nearly not visible any more (Fig. 2). However,

for all water-to-silicate ratios the aspect ratio in the inner disc is
very small, allowing only a very low pebble isolation mass and
thus the formation of small planets.

In turn the local radial gradients in surface density, temper-
ature and entropy determine the migration of planets. In partic-
ular the regions of outward migration are greatly inﬂuenced by
the water-to-silicate ratio in the disc (Fig. 3). A low water frac-
tion in the disc only allows planets with small range of masses to
migrate outwards compared to discs with a large water fraction.
Even though the diﬀerence in the migration map seem small,
they have important consequences for the formation of planets.
As the core masses are very low in the inner regions of
the protoplanetary disc (since H/r is low), the contraction of a
gaseous envelope takes a very long time, prolonging the time
before runaway gas accretion can start. In the case of the water-
to-silicate ratio of 1:3, the planets outgrow the region of outward
migration, while their core mass Mcore is still higher than their
envelope mass Menv. This means that these planets can drift to-
wards the inner regions of the disc without becoming gas giants.
On the other hand, the region of outward migration in a disc
with a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1 can accommodate planets of
higher masses. But as the pebble isolation mass is still very low,
planets in discs with a large water-to-silicate fraction can only
outgrow the region of outward migration if they are already in a
runaway gas accretion phase. Counterintuitively this means that
water-rich super-Earth planets should be more common around
stars that have a low water-to-silicate fraction.

If the overall dust content is low (Zdust = 0.1%), planets can
outgrow the region of outward migration without becoming gas
giants and migrate into the inner disc for all water-to-silicate
ratios. But as soon as the planet reaches the inner edge of the
disc with rf < 0.1 AU, the evolution of the planet is stopped in
our model, which means the planet could in principle change its
mass until the disc disperses. This is not followed in our model
due to the uncertainties of planet growth close to the inner edge
of the disc. This means that if discs have a low dust content to-
wards the end of their lifetime, predictions regarding the abun-
dance of super-Earth planets as a function of the water fraction
in the disc are not entirely certain.

However, recent simulations including photoevaporation
have shown that the dust to gas ratio increases in the late stages
of the disc evolution (Gorti et al. 2015). This means that the case
of high dust metallicity may be more relevant, implying that
water-rich super-Earths should be more common around stars
that have a low water-to-silicate fraction.

5.2. Massesoftheplanetarycores

The masses of solids that each planetary seed can accumulate
by pebble accretion are mainly determined by the pebble iso-
lation mass, which in turn is determined by the disc structure
(eq. 9). When the pebble isolation mass is reached, pebble ac-
cretion stops.

Because a larger H/r allows a higher pebble isolation mass
(eq. 9), planetary seeds that form early in the disc can form larger
planetary cores. Additionally this eﬀect is enhanced if the disc
contains a larger amount of micrometre-sized dust, as this in-
creases H/r in the disc (Fig. 2). The ﬁnal planetary core mass
for planets in discs with high and low dust content for the water-
to-silicate ratios of 3:1 and 1:3 are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.
Clearly a later starting time t0 results in smaller planetary cores.
Generally higher core masses are achieved if the planetary
seed forms early and in a silicate rich disc. On the other hand,
the formation of gas giants at large orbital distances seems eas-

Fig. 7. Final core masses of planets that start with planetary seeds at r0
and t0 for the disc with Zdust = 0.5%. The top features a water-to-silicate
ratio of 3:1, while the bottom plot features a water-to-silicate ratio of
1:3. The blue and white lines have the same meaning as in Fig. 5. Planets
that are below the top yellow line have a core mass of at least 10 Earth
masses, planets that are below the second yellow line from top have core
masses of at least 20 Earth masses. The ﬁnal core mass is determined
by the pebble isolation mass, which increases with orbital distances,
because H/r increases. However, at the outer edges of the disc, pebble
accretion is not that eﬃcient any more, so that pebble isolation mass
is not reached, leaving the ﬁnal core mass lower than at smaller orbital
distances.

ier in water rich discs, because the cores can grow faster (smaller
H/r leads to a smaller pebble scale height, allowing the transi-
tion to 2D accretion earlier). The ﬁnal core mass in the water
rich disc is generally lower, resulting in a longer phase of gas
envelope contraction. However, this longer envelope contraction
phase is overcompensated by the faster growth of the planetary
core, which allows the formation of gas giant planets in the water
rich disc at larger orbital distances and late formation times.

However, the masses of the planetary cores are about a factor
of 1.5 − 2 too small compared to the cores of the giant planets
in our solar system (∼ 15 − 30 MEarth), independently of the
water-to-silicate fraction. A possible solution to this discrepancy
could be that protoplanetary discs in their late stages are more
dusty than the normally invoked dust to gas ratio of 0.01. Alter-
natively, the pebble isolation mass inferred from isothermal 3D
simulations in Lambrechts et al. (2014) may miss a dependence
of the isolation mass on the local slope of the pressure gradient.
We plan to address this possibility in a future publication.

Another alternative to allow larger planetary cores is a dif-
ferent evolution of the protoplanetary disc. The reason why the

Fig. 8. Final core masses of planets that start with planetary seeds at r0
and t0 for the disc with Zdust = 0.1%. The top features a water-to-silicate
ratio of 3:1, the bottom plot a water-to-silicate ratio of 1:3. The coloured
lines have the same meaning as in Fig. 7. The ﬁnal core masses are
lower compared to the Zdust = 0.5% disc, because of the lower pebble
isolation mass in the outer disc. This also means that planetary seeds can
reach pebble isolation mass at larger orbital distances and later times
compared to seeds in the Zdust = 0.5%.

core masses are quite low (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8) is that the low as-
pect ratio decreases in time (Bitsch et al. 2015a). If the accretion
rate ˙M of the disc would decrease at a slower rate, then a larger
H/r could be maintained for a longer time, allowing for higher
core masses. However, in order to avoid too far inward migra-
tion of the formed planets, the disc lifetime has to be roughly
the same. This implies that the disc must disperse at a higher
accretion rate compared to the simulations shown here, where
the ﬁnal accretion rate at 3 Myr is ˙M = 2 × 10−9M
⊙/yr. Given
the ranges of accretion rates at which photoevaporation can be
eﬃcient, ( ˙Mevap ∼ ˙M = 2 − 10 × 10−9M
⊙/yr) see Alexander
et al. (2014), it is possible that the solar protoplanetary disc had a
large accretion rate that could explain the higher planetary cores
masses of the giant planets in the solar system.

The masses of the cores of small planets that drift into the
inner disc are only up to a few Earth masses. As those planets
have also reached pebble isolation mass, but not runaway gas
accretion yet, they contain an envelope of gas, which can contain
up to 50% of the planet’s total mass. The density of observed
exoplanets peaks on average at ∼ 5 MEarth, indicating planets
that are mostly rocky, in contrast to more massive exoplanets
that contain a gaseous envelope (Weiss & Marcy 2014). This is
in contrast to our simulation, where the planets drifting into the

Bitsch & Johansen: Inﬂuence of the water content in protoplanetary discs on planet migration and formation

inner disc contain gaseous envelopes, which reduces their mean
density.

However, in our simulations the eﬀects of the accretion of
planetesimals is ignored. Planetesimal accretion can not only in-
crease the accretion rate in the inner disc to some level, but also
the constant bombardment of planetesimals can also prolong and
even hinder the accretion of a gaseous envelope (Pollack et al.
1996), allowing for a higher mean density in agreement with ob-
servations.

Additionally, models of Liu et al. (2015) have shown that the
gaseous envelope of a super-Earth can be stripped away by im-
pacts after the gas disc dispersed. In our formation model, where
cores of 2−3 ME with envelopes of 2−2.5 ME drift into the inner
disc, collisions are not taken into account. But one can imagine
that collisions in the inner system take place and thus give rise to
the formation of dense rocky planets without gaseous envelopes.
On the other hand our model explains naturally the observed
planet population that have a gaseous envelope. Those planets
did not undergo collisions after the gas disc dispersed, allowing
them to keep their gaseous envelope.

The masses of planetary cores growing via pebble accretion
depends crucially on the disc’s aspect ratio. A lower aspect ratio
allows a faster growth (eq. 5), but results in a lower ﬁnal mass of
the planet (eq. 9), while a larger aspect ratio slows down the ini-
tial growth, but allows a higher ﬁnal planetary mass. In our simu-
lations we study the inﬂuence of the change of the disc structure
due to the water-to-silicate ratio on planet formation, but we kept
the viscosity of the disc ﬁxed and uniform at all orbital distances.
Studying all diﬀerent disc conﬁgurations is unfortunately com-
putationally to expensive for a study like this, but we want to
comment on the possible outcomes of a study like this.

Bitsch et al. (2014) studied the inﬂuence of a dead zone
(ranging from ∼ 1 to ∼ 10 AU at high accretion rates) on the
thermal structure of protoplanetary discs. As most of the mass
can be carried by the upper layers, a reduction of viscosity in the
mid-plane of the disc does not lead to an equally large increase in
surface density there. As a consequence the disc is colder com-
pared to a disc without a dead zone. This leads to a faster initial
pebble accretion rate, so that the cores can form faster. However,
the pebble isolation mass is lower as well, so that the ﬁnal core
mass is lower than in our nominal model. Nevertheless the as-
pect ratio is probably high enough so that the cores can grow to
a few Earth masses, indicating that they can form gas giants in
the end.

As the disc evolves in time, the dead zone shrinks and ﬁ-
nally disappears (Dzyurkevich et al. 2013; Bitsch et al. 2014),
which means that planet formation at the late stages of the
disc evolution is independent of the assumption of dead-zone
in the disc’s mid-plane. More importantly, our simulations show
that at early stages mostly gas giants are formed, which is at
odds with observations showing the abundance of super-Earths
around solar-type stars. We therefore already suggested in Bitsch
et al. (2015b) that the formation of the planetary seeds at pebble
transition mass starts late. This then indicates that our model is
independent on the assumption of a planetary dead zone.

5.3. Solarsystem

In a recent study Levison et al. (2015) incorporated accretion of
pebbles onto planetary embryos in an N-body code that addition-
ally follows the dynamical, collisional, and accretional evolution
of a large number of planetesimals. If the pebbles form slowly
enough, so that the planetesimals can gravitationally interact
with one another, the larger planetesimals scatter their smaller

siblings out of the disc of pebbles thus hindering the growths of
the small planetesimals by pebble accretion. In their study this
typically leads to the formation of one to four planetary cores of
a up to 10 MEarth between 5 and 15 AU. These planetary cores
can then accrete gas, so they could resemble the structure of the
outer solar system at the beginning of the Nice model (Tsiganis
et al. 2005).

However, in Levison et al. (2015)

1) the protoplanetary disc structure is represented by a simple
power law, which does not represent the structure of the pro-
toplanetary disc in the inner parts (see Fig. 2)

2) the accretion of gas onto the planet after it has reached pebble

isolation mass is not modelled

3) the migration of planetary embryos is ignored, even though it
strongly inﬂuence the planetary system (Bitsch et al. 2015b)

In our planet growth model, we take into account all of these
physical eﬀects, however we are missing the N-body approach
with interacting planetesimals. But as Levison et al. (2015) have
shown that only a small number of few planetary cores dominate
in mass, we can use our planetary formation code to reproduce
the initial conditions of the Nice model including an evolving
protoplanetary disc structure, gas accretion and planetary migra-
tion.

In Fig. 9 we show the growth tracks of the four gas giants
in our solar system in a disc with Zdust = 0.5%, Zpeb = 1.0%
and a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1. We can very nicely reproduce
the orbital distance and planetary masses for Jupiter and Saturn
within the limits of the Nice model. Also our analogues for Nep-
tune and Uranus ﬁt within those parameters, but they are slightly
too small. However, the formation of the ice giants could also be
aided by giant impacts of planetary embryos that form outside of
Jupiter and Saturns orbit (Izidoro et al. 2015).

For water-to-silicate ratios of 1:1 and 1:3, the formation of
the exact initial conditions of the Nice model is not possible,
as Jupiter is slightly too small (Bitsch et al. 2015b). The main
problem here is not the formation of a Jupiter mass planet at ∼ 5
AU, but to have at the same time a Saturn mass planet at ∼ 8
AU, as we do not want the orbits of planets to cross at any time
during their evolution.

In the case of Zdust = 0.1%, the initial conﬁguration of the
Nice model can be reproduced for all diﬀerent water-to-silicate
ratios in the disc. The main diﬀerence is that now the outermost
planet has to be formed around ∼ 30 AU, which is a slightly
larger orbital distances than for discs with a larger dust content.
The reason for that is the smaller H/r in discs with a low dust
content that reduces the pebble isolation mass and thus deter-
mines the mass of the planetary core.

In our simulations, the planetary seeds for the giant planets
form around 25 AU and then migrate inwards closer to their ﬁnal
orbital positions. At the late formation times of the planetary
seeds, the disc is already very cold (T < 25 K) in the outer parts
of the disc. At these temperatures, CO can freeze out and is also
detectable in protoplanetary discs around sun like stars (Qi et al.
2013). In particular Qi et al. (2013) observed the CO ice line at
∼ 30 AU matching the temperature proﬁle in our simulations.
Ali-Dib et al. (2014) showed that the chemical composition of
the giant planets in our solar system can be naturally explained
if their formation starts at the CO ice line. This means our model
can not only explain the formation of giant planets in the solar
system, but also their composition.

Fig. 9. Evolution of the total planetary masses as a function of orbital
distance for a solar-system analogue with the giant planets ending up
in a conﬁguration similar to the initial conditions of the Nice model.
Jupiter starts at t0 = 1.68 Myr, Saturn and t0 = 1.92 Myr, Neptune and
Uranus both start at t0 = 2.04 Myr. We display Neptune inside of Uranus
here, as they often switch places during the Nice model (Tsiganis et al.
2005). We have used here Zdust = 0.5% and a metallicity of pebbles of
Z = 1.0% where the disc has a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1. The mass
of the cores for all giant planets is ∼ 7 MEarth.

5.4. Correlationofplanetarymasswithhoststarmetallicity

The observations of exoplanets have revealed that giant planets
are more common around stars that have an increased metallicity
compared to the solar value (Fischer & Valenti 2005; Buchhave
et al. 2014; Santos et al. 2015). In particular the study of Buch-
have et al. (2014) showed that giant planets (with RP > 4REarth)
are rarely found around stars with a metallicity of [Z/H] ≤ −0.2.
This was explained simply by the fact that not enough build-
ing blocks in solids were available to form planetary cores that
are big enough to accrete gas to become gas giants. However,
the very eﬃcient pebble accretion mechanism for building cores
could provide a fast enough growth to form big enough cores
that can accrete gas contradicting the observations.

The study of Bensby et al. (2014) investigated the metallicity
and composition of dwarf stars close to our sun. They ﬁnd that
stars with a metallicity of [Fe/H] ∼ −0.2 are enriched in oxy-
gen compared to silicate by 1.4 : 1. This could imply that the
discs around those stars were enriched by water compared to sil-
icate as well. An enrichment in water compared to silicate in the
disc actually favours giant planet formation (see Fig. 5), so we
present in Fig. 10 the ﬁnal planetary masses for planetary seeds
that were placed in a disc with Zpeb = 0.5%, Zdust = 0.1% and
a water-to-silicate ration of 3 : 1 at an initial time t0 and with
initial orbital distances r0.

As can be seen in Fig. 10 the parameter space that allows for
the formation of gas giants like Jupiter is very small. The for-
mation of giant planets is only possible in the inner parts of the
disc at early times and in the very out parts of the disc. In the
inner disc at early times the disc is hot enough, so that planets
can reach a high pebble isolation mass, reducing the contraction
phase of the gaseous envelope and therefore allowing fast gas ac-
cretion before the planet’s migration stops at the inner disc edge.
The planetary seeds in the outer disc can reach a higher isola-
tion mass, because the disc is ﬂared, and are thus able to grow
to become gas giants, however only if they form early enough to
leave enough time to form the planetary core.

6. Summary

In this paper we studied the inﬂuence of a diﬀerent water-to-
silicate ratio and metallicity in dust grains Zdust on the structure
of protoplanetary discs and the formation and migration of plan-
ets. A larger amount of dust particles results in a hotter disc,
independent on the exact chemical composition of the disc. A
change in the water fraction changes the opacity, because the ab-
sorption and re-emission properties of the dust particles changes
dependent on the chemical composition of the dust particles.
This then changes the cooling function of the disc and hence the
temperature proﬁle of the disc. A change of the temperature pro-
ﬁle then directly changes the scale height of the disc (T ∝ H2)
and thus the viscosity inside the disc. In turn, this changes the
surface density proﬁle, because we drive our simulations to a
constant accretion rate ˙M at each radial distance (eq. 2).

These changes in the disc structure have direct consequences
on the migration of planets inside the disc, because the migration
direction and speed depends on the gradients of surface density,
temperature and entropy. In particular discs that have a larger
water fraction can harbour slightly more massive planets in the
regions of outward migration at the late stages of the disc evolu-
tion compared to discs with a small water fraction. This has im-
portant consequences for the formation and evolution of planets
in those discs, because planets with lower masses can outgrow
the region of outward migration easier and migrate inwards eas-
ier in discs with a smaller water content. This implies that plan-
ets with lower masses can only migrate to orbits close to the host
star if the water content in the disc is low.

Planetary seeds that are embedded in the protoplanetary disc
start to grow initially through the accretion of pebbles until they
reach their pebble isolation mass (Lambrechts et al. 2014), which
is when gas accretion onto the planetary core can start. The
growth rate of the core depends on the amount of pebbles in
the disc and on the initial location r0 and initial time t0 when
the planetary seeds is placed in the disc. This also inﬂuences
the ﬁnal mass of the core, because the pebble isolation mass is
a strong function of the disc structure (eq. 9), which evolves in
time (Fig. 2). In particular the aspect ratio of the disc decreases
in time, resulting in a lower pebble isolation mass and hence a
lower ﬁnal core mass.

After reaching pebble isolation mass, the planetary core can
start to accrete gas. However before runaway gas accretion can

Bitsch & Johansen: Inﬂuence of the water content in protoplanetary discs on planet migration and formation

start, the gaseous envelope needs to contract until Menv ∼ Mcore.
This contraction phase is shorter for larger planetary cores (Piso
& Youdin 2014), meaning that small cores (around 2 MEarth) take
a very long time to contract their envelope.

Discs with a larger dust content (Zdust = 0.5%) and a larger
water fraction allow the formation of giant planets at later times
and farther away from their host star compared to discs with a
small water fraction. On the other hand, a larger silicate fraction
in the disc allows the migration of small ice planets and ice gi-
ants to hot and warm orbits close to the host star, which is not
possible in the disc with a large water content. This is caused by
the fact that lower mass planets can outgrow the region of out-
ward migration and move inwards before they enter the runaway
gas accretion phase and become gas giants.

If a lower dust content (Zdust = 0.1%) is present in the disc,
the amount of ice planets and ice giants that can drift to the inner
disc is increased independent of the water-to-silicate mixture.
However, photoevaporation can increase the dust-to-gas ratio in
the late stages of the disc (Gorti et al. 2015), indicating that the
disc model with Zdust = 0.5% may be the more common case
in the late stages of disc evolution when the major core growth
occurs.

As the disc evolves in time, the structure of the disc changes.
In particular the aspect ratio of the disc decreases in time (with
decreasing ˙M) and with it the pebble isolation mass. Therefore,
the later a planetary seed forms, the lower its ﬁnal core mass.
But even for early formation of planetary seeds we ﬁnd that the
ﬁnal core mass is a factor 1.5 − 2 too low when compared to the
ice and gas giants in our own solar system. This problem can be
overcome if the disc has a larger ˙M during its evolution, which
results in a hotter disc and higher cores masses, and disperses at
˙M. Photoevaporation at a relatively high ˙M of
a larger value of
˙Mevap ∼ ˙M = 2 − 10 × 10−9M
⊙/yr can occur if driven by X-rays
(Ercolano et al. 2009; Alexander et al. 2014).

Studies of the composition of exoplanets reveal that low
mass planets (MP < 5 ME) are mostly rocky, while more massive
planets contain a gaseous envelope (Weiss & Marcy 2014). The
small planets formed in our simulations that then migrate into the
inner disc have reached pebble isolation mass and therefore con-
tain a gaseous envelope smaller than their core mass. Collisions
between these planets can then strip them from their atmosphere
after the gas disc dispersed (Liu et al. 2015), allowing the for-
mation of planets without extended atmospheres. On the other
hand our model explains naturally planets with (MP > 5 ME)
harbouring a gaseous envelope.

We have shown in this paper that the chemical composition
(the water-to-silicate ratio) of the micrometre-sized dust grains
in the protoplanetary disc inﬂuences the disc structure and with
it the migration and formation pattern of planetary cores in those
discs. In particular, a low water abundance relative to silicates
allows icy cores to migrate to sub-AU orbits. Thus our results
imply that some observed super-Earths in orbits close to their
host star should contain a large proportion of water accreted out-
side of the ice line.

Fig. A.1. Final masses of planets that start with planetary seeds at r0
and t0 in a disc with Zdust = 0.5% and a metallicity in pebbles of Zpeb =
1.0%. The blue, white and yellow lines have the same meaning as in
Fig. 5 and the disc features a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1. However, in
contrast to the previous simulations, we have turned oﬀ the reduction of
the migration speed in type-II migration due to the planet’s inertia.

Appendix A: Type-II migration

Growing planets migrate through the disc. In the initial stage,
their migration rate is determined by type-I migration, but as
soon as the planets become big enough to open gaps in the pro-
toplanetary discs, their migration is described by type-II migra-
tion. Recent studies, however, have revealed that the type-II mi-
gration rate might not be related to the viscous evolution of the
protoplanetary disc (Dürmann & Kley 2015). Unfortunately, hy-
drodynamical studies of planet disc interactions have not pro-
gressed far enough to describe these eﬀects in an updated type-II
migration rate formula that can be used in a code like ours or in
N-body codes. In our standard model, the type-II migration rate
is described in eq. 11. In Fig. A.1 we show the results of our
planet formation model, if no reduction of the type-II migration
rate due to the planet’s inertia is taken into account.

Despite the fact that planetary migration is faster, our planet
formation model with pebble accretion is still able to form gi-
ant planets. However, the ﬁnal orbital distribution of planets is
completely diﬀerent. There are basically no planets stranded be-
tween 0.1 and 1.0 AU. All giant planets are now either inside of
0.1 AU or outside of 1.0 AU. The reason for this lies in the re-
duction of the type-II migration speed in eq. 11, where the speed
of the planet is reduced more and more the closer the planet is
to the central star. Additionally we now observe many more Sat-
urn mass planets in the inner part of the disc compared to our
standard model (Fig. 5).

Planetary seeds that form in the outer parts of the disc are
not aﬀected by the reduction of the type-II migration rate due to
the inertia, because the outer disc is so massive that it dominates
over the planetary mass. Late forming seeds are also unaﬀected
by a change in the type-II migration rate, because they do not
grow to become gap opening gas giants in the ﬁrst place.

Clearly, the type-II migration rate is important for the out-
come of any planet formation model that wants to explain the
formation of gas giants. But unfortunately many more hydrody-
namical studies of planet-disc interactions have to be undertaken
in order to constrain the type-II migration rate so that it can be
incorporated in planet formation models.

Fig. B.1. Final masses of planets that start with planetary seeds at r0
and t0 in a disc with Zdust = 0.5% and a metallicity in pebbles of Zpeb =
1.0%. The blue, white and yellow lines have the same meaning as in
Fig. 5 and the disc features a water-to-silicate ratio of 3:1. However, in
contrast to the previous simulations, the opacity for the contraction of
the envelope is set to κenv = 0.1cm2/g.

Appendix B: Envelope contraction

After the core reaches pebble isolation mass, it contracts a
gaseous envelope. This contraction phase depends on the plane-
tary mass and on the cooling rate of the planetary envelope. The
cooling rate of the envelope is determined by the opacity κenv
inside it, which changes due to the amount and size distribution
of grains. For the envelope contraction we follow Piso & Youdin
(2014), who give an accretion rate of

where f is a fudge factor to change the accretion rate in order
to match numerical and analytical results, which is normally set
to f = 0.2 (Piso & Youdin 2014). The density of the core is
set to ρc = 5.5g/cm3. Here we use κenv = 0.05cm2/g, which is
very similar to the values used in the study by Movshovitz &
Podolak (2008). In Fig. B.1 we have increased κenv to 0.1cm2/g.
The contraction time of the envelope is therefore twice as long.
The main diﬀerences are i) it is possible for ice giants to mi-
grate all the way to the central star and ii) the formation of gas
giants at later ages is hindered. The cores of the ice giant popu-
lation form at a few AU from the host star and reach a moderate
pebble isolation mass (6 − 7 Earth masses), which gives them
also a moderate time for the contraction of the gaseous envelope.
As the planets grow, they reach the region of outward migration
and stay there during most of the envelope contraction phase, but
eventually they become too massive and migrate towards the star
before they reach runaway gas accretion. Formation at the same
r0, but at later times (larger t0), results in lower core masses,
which allows the planets to stay in the region of outward migra-
tion until gas runaway accretion is reached. These planets then
become gas giants. The longer envelope contraction phase then
also hinders planets forming at later times to reach runaway gas
accretion, so that they stay outside of a few AU, trapped at the
outer edge of the region of outward migration.

Clearly, the opacity inside the planetary envelope is very im-
portant for the outcome of planet formation studies. However,
we assume that the opacity in the envelope is very small for two
reasons:

i) As the planet reaches pebble isolation mass, it accelerates the
gas outside of it is orbit to a super-Keplerian speed (Lam-
brechts et al. 2014), which hinders particles to reach the
planet. This means that the gas accreted by the planet is prob-
ably depleted in heavy elements.

ii) The planet formation model via pebble accretion requires
only a very small density of solids, while in classical core
accretion scenarios a large surface density of planetesimals
is invoked to form the core in the ﬁrst place (Pollack et al.
1996). This larger amount of planetesimals also leads to
larger collision rates of the gas accreting planet with plan-
etesimals, which prolongs the contraction of the gaseous en-
velope. Additionally, simulations by Levison et al. (2015)
have shown that the smaller planetesimals are scattered out
of the mid-plane of the disc, which should prevent them from
being accreted by the dominant gas accreting planet. The
combination of a low surface density of planetesimals and
the eﬀects of scattering of planetesimals result in less solids
being accrete by the gas accreting planet, reducing the opac-
ity in the envelope and therefore accelerating the contraction
of the envelope.
