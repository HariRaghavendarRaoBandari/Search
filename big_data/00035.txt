ABSTRACT

A sample of 102 local (0.02 ≤ z ≤ 0.1) Seyfert galaxies with black hole masses MBH > 107M⊙ was selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and observed using the Keck 10-m telescope to study the scaling
relations between MBH and host galaxy properties. We study proﬁle changes of the broad Hβ emission line
within the ∼ 3 - 9 year time-frame between the two sets of spectra. The variability of the broad Hβ emission
line is of particular interest, not only since it is used to estimate MBH, but also since its strength and width is
used to classify Seyfert galaxies into different types. At least some form of broad-line variability (in either
width or ﬂux) is observed in the majority (∼66%) of the objects, resulting in a Seyfert-type change for ∼38%
of the objects, likely driven by variable accretion and/or obscuration. The broad Hβ line virtually disappears
in 3/102 (∼3%) extreme cases. We discuss potential causes for these changing-look AGNs. While similar
dramatic transitions have previously been reported in the literature, either on a case-by-case basis or in larger
samples focusing on quasars at higher redshifts, our study provides statistical information on the frequency of
Hβ line variability in a sample of low-redshift Seyfert galaxies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Observed relations between the mass of the supermassive
black hole (MBH) at the center of a galaxy and the properties
of its host galaxy – such as host galaxy mass (Magorrian et al.
1998), luminosity (Kormendy & Richstone 1995), and stel-
lar velocity dispersion (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et
al. 2000) – imply a relationship between galaxy evolution and
black hole (BH) growth (for a recent review see Kormendy &
Ho 2013; Graham 2016, and references therein). In the lo-
cal Universe, MBH can be measured by spatially resolving the
BH sphere of inﬂuence using stellar or gas kinematics (e.g.,
van der Marel et al. 1998; Gebhardt et al. 2000). At larger
distances, the only way to estimate MBH is by resolving the
BH sphere of inﬂuence as it responds to variations in con-
tinuum in galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). In
AGNs, the BH is actively growing via an accretion disk of in-
falling material. The high energy photons emitted by the hot
accretion disk ionize the surrounding gas clouds, the broad-
line region (BLR) in the vicinity of the BH, and the narrow-
line region (NLR) further out. Reverberation mapping (Wan-
del et al. 1999; Kaspi et al. 2005; Bentz et al. 2013) traces
variations in the accretion-disk continuum luminosity and the
time-delayed response of the BLR ﬂux to determine the size
of the BLR, using light-travel time arguments. The velocity
of the BLR gas can be determined from the Doppler broad-
ening of the emission lines (such as the broad Hβ line in the
rest-frame optical). By assuming a dimensionless virial coef-
ﬁcient to describe the kinematics and geometry of the BLR,
the velocity and size of the BLR combined yield MBH. More
recently, there have been attempts to estimate MBH in indi-
vidual objects independent of a virial coefﬁcient by modeling

reverberation-mapped data directly and constraining the ge-
ometry and kinematics of the BLR (see e.g., Pancoast et al.
2014, and references therein).

Seyfert galaxies are low luminosity AGNs for which the
host galaxy can be easily resolved, thus making them attrac-
tive targets for the study of the MBH scaling relations.
In
fact, for a few Seyfert galaxies, MBH estimates from both
dynamical AO measurements as well as reverberation map-
ping are available (Hicks & Malkan 2008). Seyfert galaxies
are categorized into different types based on their emission
line proﬁles, ranging from type-1 to type-2 with subclasses
(type-1.5, 1.8, and 1.9) in-between. Type-1 Seyferts display
both broad and narrow components of emission lines, while
type-2 Seyferts show only the narrow components. The in-
termediate Seyfert types show varying levels of broad com-
ponent emission. The Balmer series in the optical regime is
generally used to classify Seyfert type (Osterbrock & Koski
1976; Osterbrock 1977, 1981, Table 1 summarizes the differ-
ent Seyfert-type classiﬁcations).

In the framework of the so-called standard uniﬁed model
for active galaxies, all Seyfert galaxies are thought to be in-
trinsically the same but viewed from a different angle. The
key to this model is a region of cold gas and dust, called the
dusty torus, that surrounds the BLR and, if seen edge on,
can shield both the accretion disk continuum and the broad
emission lines from the observer’s view, resulting in a type-2
Seyfert galaxy. If seen face on, however, both accretion disk
and BLR are visible, resulting in a type-1 Seyfert galaxy. In-
termediate types-1.5, 1.8, and 1.9 are viewed along the edges
of the dusty torus where it is not optically thick enough to
fully block the broad lines. In other words, in this simpliﬁed

2

Runco et al.

model, the presence or absence of broad lines is attributed
solely to viewing orientation, meaning that the Seyfert type
of a galaxy does not change. (Note that the orientation of the
torus is entirely independent of the host-galaxy orientation.)
However, there have been many reports of apparent Seyfert-
type changes in the literature (e.g., Tohline & Osterbrock
1976; Kollatschny & Fricke 1985; Storchi-Bergmann et al.
1993; Aretxaga et al. 1999; Eracleous & Halpern 2001; Trippe
et al. 2008; Denney et al. 2014; Shappee et al. 2014; Parker et
al. 2015). These changes can occur in either direction. NGC
4151 is one of the most notable and cited examples. Orig-
inally classiﬁed as a type-1.5 (Osterbrock 1977), the broad
emission lines disappeared throughout the 1980’s (Antonucci
& Cohen 1983; Lyutyi, Oknyanskii & Chuvaev 1984; Pen-
ston & Perez 1984), but have returned since (Shapovalova,
Popovic & Burenkov et al. 2010). Another well-studied ex-
ample is Mrk 590 which has been observed over a 40-year
time scale. First observed as a type-1.5, Mrk 590 transitioned
to a type-1 before the broad lines disappeared, making it a
type∼1.9-2 Seyfert (Denney et al. 2014). Possible causes of
these changing-look AGNs include changes in extinction (due
to our line-of-sight grazing the dusty torus, for instance; e.g.,
Goodrich 1989; Leighly et al. 2015), or changes in the AGN
accretion rate (e.g., Nicastro 2000; Korista & Goad 2004;
Elitzur, Ho, & Trump 2014) In rare cases, the increase in ac-
cretion rate could be due to the tidal disruption and accretion
of a star, and a few cases of dramatic broad-line variability
possibly linked to this scenario, have been reported in recent
years (e.g., Komossa et al. 2008; Arcavi et al. 2014; LaMassa
et al. 2015; Merloni et al. 2015).

A certain degree of variability in the ﬂux and proﬁle of the
BLR emission, as a response to changes in the continuum ﬂux
(and thus accretion), is not only expected, but in fact forms the
basis for reverberation mapping studies. Such studies have
shown that variations in continuum ﬂux and that of the broad
Balmer lines are correlated in a way so that the derived MBH
does not change (Bentz et al. 2007; Park et al. 2012; Barth
et al. 2015). However, extreme variability leading to a type
change seems to be rare.

Here, we address the question of the frequency of these
changing-look AGNs by taking advantage of a statistical sam-
ple of 102 local Seyfert galaxies with archival spectra from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and high-quality Keck
spectra taken 6.4 ± 1.8 years apart. The paper is organized in
the following manner. Section 2 summarizes the sample se-
lection, observations, and data reduction. Section 3 describes
the analysis of the data. Section 4 discusses the derived quan-
tities and results from the data. Section 5 concludes with
a summary. The appendix contains a table of observations
and Seyfert-type transitions for the sample (A), comparison
of SDSS and Keck spectra (B), ﬁts to the SDSS and Keck
spectra (C), and SDSS optical images for two extreme objects
(D). Throughout the paper, a Hubble constant of Ho = 70 km
s- 1, Ωλ = 0.7, and ΩM = 0.3 is assumed.

2. SAMPLE SELECTION, OBSERVATIONS, AND DATA

REDUCTION

The primary goal behind sample selection and observations
is the creation of a local baseline for the BH mass scaling re-
lations of active galaxies, presented by Bennert et al. (2011);
Harris et al. (2012); Bennert et al. (2015). These papers de-
scribe the sample selection, Keck observations, and Keck data
reduction in detail. We here provide a brief summary only.

2.1. Sample Selection

A sample of 102 local (0.02 ≤ z ≤ 0.1) type-1 Seyfert
galaxies was selected from the SDSS data release six (DR6)
(Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008). Objects were selected on
the basis of a broad Hβ emission line with an estimated MBH
>107M⊙ (Bennert et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2012). Note that of
these 102 objects, only 79 are used by Bennert et al. (2015) to
study the MBH-σ relation, since the necessary quantities (i.e.,
λL5100, MBH, σ) for that study were only accessible for these
79 objects.

2.2. SDSS Observations and Data Reduction

SDSS spectra are obtained from a 2.5-m ground based tele-
scope with a 3" diameter circular optical ﬁber and an exposure
time of 54 seconds. SDSS spectra cover a wavelength range
of 3800Å to 9200Å with an instrumental resolution of 170 km
s- 1. SDSS data are already fully reduced and ﬂux calibrated
when retrieved from the SDSS archive.

2.3. Keck Observations and Data Reduction

The 102 objects selected from SDSS were observed again
between January 2009 and March 2010 with the Low Reso-
lution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) at the Keck 10-m tele-
scope using a 1" x 2" wide rectangular long slit aligned with
the major axis of the host galaxy (given by SDSS). (While
all objects were observed at as low airmass as possible, given
observation constraints, for individual objects the airmass can
be as high as 1.4.) Objects observed in 2009 used a D560
dichroic, and objects observed in 2010 used a D680 dichroic.
The blue Keck spectra were taken with the 600/400 grism giv-
ing a wavelength range of ∼3200-5350Å and an instrumental
resolution of ∼90 km s- 1; the red spectra were taken with the
831/8200 grating centered on 8950Å with a resolution of ∼45
km s- 1. (Note that the red Keck spectra are not used in this
paper since they only cover the Ca triplet absorption lines for
an accurate measurement of σ). The exposure times gener-
ally range from 600 to 1200 s. Keck spectra were taken on
average 6.4 ± 1.8 years after the SDSS spectra, ranging from
2.6 to 9.1 years (see Table A1 for details on SDSS and Keck
observations).

The Keck data are reduced following standard reduction
steps such as bias subtraction, ﬂat ﬁeld correcting, cosmic
ray rejection, and wavelength calibration. AOV Hipparcos
stars were used to correct for telluric absorption and relative
ﬂux calibration. Note that, unlike SDSS spectra, Keck spectra
are not absolute ﬂux calibrated because observing conditions
were typically not photometric. 1D spectra were extracted
from the 2D spectra with a width of 1.08" (8 pixels) to encom-
pass the BLR, given the slit width of 1” and a typical seeing
of 1”.

2.4. Lick Observations and Data Reduction

For eight objects with signiﬁcantly weaker or apparently
absent broad Hβ emission in the Keck spectra, follow-up ob-
servations were conducted in January and March of 2013 with
the 3m Shane telescope of Lick observatory using the Kast
spectrograph and 60 min total exposure time per object. (Ta-
ble A1; Scott 2013). The slit was aligned either along the ma-
jor axis or perpendicular to it. 1D spectra were extracted using
a 4 pixel (≈3") width centered on the peak ﬂux to mimic the
3" diameter circular ﬁber of SDSS. The data were reduced fol-
lowing standard procedures. The Lick spectra are presented

by Scott (2013). These spectra are used to determine their
Seyfert type, since they also cover the Hα region. The Seyfert
types based on the Lick spectra are listed in Table A1.

3. ANALYSIS

In this paper, we focus on four different sets of spectra, for
short called “Keck subtracted,” “Keck unsubtracted,” “SDSS
subtracted,” and “SDSS unsubtracted,” as explained in the
next two sections.

3.1. Unsubtracted Spectra

To classify Seyfert type and perform a qualitative compari-
son of the Hβ region, the reduced spectra are used. Through-
out the paper, these spectra are referred to as the unsubtracted
data set.

For a visual comparison of both data sets (Appendix B), the
Keck spectra were re-binned to match the lower spectral res-
olution of the SDSS spectra. For visual presentation purposes
of a direct comparison between both spectra in Figures B, the
spectra were normalized to constant 5007Å [OIII] emission,
assuming that the 5007Å [OIII] emission line ﬂux is identical
in both data sets, given that emission from the extended NLR
does not vary over the observed timescales. This scaling also
assumes that both spectra integrate the same [OIII] emission
over the same area which might not necessarily be the case,
given the different apertures used. Aligning the long Keck slit
along the major axis of the host galaxy may reduce any dif-
ference in [OIII] ﬂux covered. However, we discuss aperture
effects in more detail below.

3.2. Hβ Fitting and Subtracted Spectra

A multi-component spectral decomposition is used to ﬁt the
region around Hβ. The procedure is summarized here brieﬂy
(see Park et al. 2015, for details).

First, the observed continuum is modeled and subtracted by
ﬁtting a pseudo-continuum consisting of the featureless AGN
power-law continuum, host-galaxy starlight templates from
the Indo-US spectral library (Valdez et al. 2004), and the AGN
FeII emission template from Boroson & Green (1992) for the
Keck spectra and from Kovacevic et al. (2010) for the SDSS
spectra1. Then, the continuum-subtracted Hβ line region is
modeled by ﬁtting Gauss-Hermite series (van der Marel &
Franx 1993; Woo et al. 2006; McGill et al. 2008) simultane-
ously to the [OIII] narrow emission lines λλ4959,5007Å and
the broad and narrow Hβ lines, to allow for the ﬁtting of
asymmetries. Gauss-Hermite polynomials of order 3-6 are
used to ﬁt the broad Hβ line and 7-12 for each [OIII] line. In
cases where the HeII λ4686Å emission line is blended with
the broad Hβ, the broad and narrow HeII were ﬁtted by sim-
ple Gaussian functions.

Depending on the degree of overlap of the broad Hβ com-
ponent with the [OIII] lines, we model the Hβ line region
in two slightly different ways.
If there is no blending be-
tween the broad Hβ component and the [OIII]λ5007Å line,
we create a template for the narrow line components by ﬁt-
ting the [OIII]λ5007Å line with a Gauss-Hermite series func-
tion. The [OIII]λ4959Å line is then subtracted by blueshift-
ing the template with a ﬂux scale ratio ﬁxed to 1:3 (see, e.g.,

1 The two different FeII templates are being used due to the different wave-
length ranges covered by the Keck and SDSS spectra. The Keck spectra do
not extend far enough into the red to ﬁt the FeII features around 5200Å with
the Kovacevic et al. (2010) multi-component template and instead must be
ﬁtted with the monolithic template from Boroson & Green (1992).

Dimitrijevi´c et al. 2007, and references therein). Then, the
broad and narrow Hβ components are ﬁtted simultaneously
through χ2-minimization, using the blueshifted template from
the [OIII]λ5007Å line as a template for the narrow Hβ, with
the ﬂux ratio as a free parameter, and a Gauss-Hermite series
for the broad Hβ component.

If the broad Hβ component is heavily blended with the
[OIII] doublet lines, we model the Hβ broad and narrow
lines and the [OIII]λλ4959, 5007Å lines all together by si-
multaneously ﬁtting a Gauss-Hermite series function to the
broad Hβ component and another Gauss-Hermite series func-
tion to the [OIII]λ5007Å line, where the model for the
[OIII]λ5007Å line is blueshifted and also used for both the
[OIII]λ4959Å line with a 1:3 ﬂux scale ratio and the narrow
Hβ component with a free ﬂux scale ratio. This approach is
based on the known ﬁxed ﬂux ratio of [OIII]λλ4959, 5007 of
1:3 and the fact that the [OIII] lines and the narrow Hβ lines
originate in the NLR and should have comparable widths. It
is an approach typically used to ﬁt AGN spectra in e.g., rever-
beration mapping studies (Park et al. 2015; Barth et al. 2015).
The results of the spectral ﬁtting are given in Table A2,
ﬁts are shown in Appendix C. The pure emission-line spectra
– with host-galaxy, power-law continuum and FeII emission
subtracted – are referred to in the following as the subtracted
data.

Note that for one object in the sample (1655+2014), the
S/N ratio is too low (in both SDSS and Keck spectra) for an
accurate measurement of the broad Hβ line. For three other
objects (0932+0405, 0847+1824, and 0831+0521), the broad
Hβ component could not be accurately identiﬁed in the Keck
spectra. These four objects are excluded from any discussion
involving the Hβ line ﬁtting.

3.3. Seyfert-Type Classiﬁcation

The Seyfert type for all objects was classiﬁed independently
by eye by two members of the team (JNR & MC) following
Table 1, and has been veriﬁed independently by the broad Hβ
emission-line ﬁtting results. Table A1 lists the Seyfert-type
classiﬁcations for both SDSS and Keck spectra, as well as
the eight objects observed at Lick. Typically, the Hα and Hβ
lines are used for Seyfert-type classiﬁcation, and we followed
that procedure for the SDSS and Lick spectra. However, the
Keck spectra do not extend to the Hα line. Instead, higher
order Balmer lines (Hγ and Hδ) were used as a proxy, see Ta-
ble 1 (Osterbrock 1977). However, these lines are intrinsically
much fainter than Hα and Hβ; for example, assuming case B
recombination, Hδ (Hγ) is ∼26% (47%) the strength of Hβ
which itself is approximately 35% of Hα (Osterbrock 1989).
Moreover, the Hγ line is often blended with the 4383Å FeI
and the 4363Å [OIII] lines, cautioning the use of this line for
classiﬁcation. Thus, we rely on the Hβ line for classiﬁcation.
This implies that we cannot differentiate between types-1.9
and 2 for Keck spectra. We conservatively classify an object
without a broad Hβ line in the Keck spectra as a type-1.9.
Note that given the lower S/N of the SDSS spectra, caution
should be exercised when classifying the Seyfert sub-types
(1.5, 1.8, and 1.9) since broad lines can be easily lost in the
noise. However, given that these are all local Seyfert galaxies,
generally, S/N ratios are good even for the SDSS spectra. The
observed variability of the broad Hβ line is substantial and the
overall trend is for a weaker broad Hβ line in Keck, partially
due to selection effects (see discussion below).

For a more quantitative determination of Seyfert type, we

4

Runco et al.

used the Hβ broad/narrow peak-ﬂux ratios and compared
them to the visual classiﬁcation. The reason for choosing
peak-ﬂux ratios are threefold.
(i) Using ﬂux ratios elimi-
nates uncertainties on absolute ﬂux calibration. Moreover,
compared to integrated ﬂux ratios, (ii) peak-ﬂux ratios are
essentially driving the visual classiﬁcation scheme; and (iii)
the width of the broad Hβ line can have large uncertainties
and depends strongly on the placement of the continuum. De-
pending on the signal-to-noise (S/N) of the data, it can easily
be either lost in the noise or noise can be ﬁtted as a broad
Hβ line. Thus, integrated-ﬂux ratios are more uncertain than
peak-ﬂux ratios.

While there is scatter between these two different clas-
siﬁcation approaches, we determined cutoffs in the Hβ
broad/narrow peak ﬂux ratios by minimizing the number of
outliers. For a peak-ﬂux ratio ≥ 1.25 there is an 83% chance
that the object is a type-1, for 1.25 ≥ peak-ﬂux ratio ≥ 0.6,
there is a 67% chance that the object is a type-1.5, and for a
peak-ﬂux ratio ≤ 0.6 there is a 72% change that the object is
a type-1.8. All type-1.9 objects have a peak-ﬂux ratio of 0,
since there is no broad Hβ component. Below (Section 4.1),
we discuss the results based on both visual classiﬁcation as
well as peak-ﬂux ratios. The peak-ﬂux ratios are given in Ta-
ble A1.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1. Seyfert-Type Transitions

Based on our visual classiﬁcations, at least some degree of
type transition is exhibited by 39/102 objects (39±10%). To
quantify the “magnitude” of the transition, we assign a value
between +4 and - 4 in increments of 1, with a positive value if
the broad Hβ line weakened between SDSS and Keck. Type
changes of +4 indicate a full type transition from type-1 to
2; +3 indicates the object transitioned three types (e.g., 1 to
1.9); +2 indicates a transition of two types (e.g., 1 to 1.8); and
+1 indicates a transition of one type (e.g., 1 to 1.5); 0 indi-
cates that the object did not experience a Seyfert-type change.
A negative value implies that the Hβ line increased between
SDSS and Keck. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the type
transitions quantiﬁed in this way.

While there are type transitions in either direction, there are
more objects that transition towards a narrower/weaker broad
Hβ line in Keck (transition towards type-2) which is likely a
reﬂection of our sample selection, since only Seyfert galax-
ies with a broad Hβ component were selected from SDSS
(Bennert et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2012). Of the 39 objects
with a type transition, the majority (31) experiences only a
minor type change (±1 magnitude transition), while eight un-
derwent greater type changes of 2. One object (0847+1824)
demonstrated a type transition of magnitude 3. We consider
three objects (3% of the sample) extreme objects since they
all show cases of a disappearing broad Hβ line between SDSS
and Keck. We discuss them in detail in Section 4.3. There is
no correlation between the magnitude of the type transition
and the time between observations, indicating that a Seyfert-
type change happens on shorter time scales than those covered
by our observations (6.4±1.8 years).

If we instead use our peak-ﬂux ratio cutoffs, as discussed
in Section 4.1, to classify the Seyfert type, the results change
only slightly. 46/102 objects undergo a type transition, with
the majority (39) experiencing only a minor type change
(±1 magnitude transition), while 7 underwent greater type
changes of 2. However, we consider the visual classiﬁcation

more reliable, and it is also commonly used in the literature.
Thus, in the following we refer to the visual classiﬁcation.

As outlined in the introduction, AGN type changes have
previously been observed in the literature and are often re-
ferred to as "changing-look" AGNs (see, e.g., Denney et al.
2014; LaMassa et al. 2015; Runnoe et al. 2016, and refer-
ences therein); indeed, the frequency and strength of our ob-
served Hβ emission line variability is in line with one of the
ﬁrst studies on this topic (Rosenblatt et al. 1994).

Two common explanations of type transitions are vari-
able accretion and variable obscuration. Variable accretion,
caused by ﬂuctuating amounts of gas available to feed the BH
(Bochkarev 2006), results in a change of the continuum ﬂux
and subsequently in a change of the broad Hβ emission line
ﬂux, since the BLR clouds are photoionized by the UV con-
tinuum. There are many papers citing variable accretion as
the driving force behind Seyfert-type transitions (Eracleous
& Halpern 2001; Trippe et al. 2008; Shappee et al. 2014;
Denney et al. 2014). Denney et al. (2014) is the most no-
table example reporting Mrk 590 to transition from type-1.5
to type-1, then transition again to type∼1.9-2. Shappee et al.
(2014) (for NGC 2617), Trippe et al. (2008) (for NGC 2992),
and Antonucci & Cohen (1983) (for NGC 4151) report an
observed change in X-ray ﬂux that is followed by a simi-
lar change in UV/optical ﬂux. Variable extinction can occur
when dusty clouds pass our line-of-sight. For Seyfert galax-
ies, the source of this obscuration is likely the dusty torus,
thought to surround the BLR in the framework of the stan-
dard uniﬁed model. The individual cold gas clouds of the
dusty torus are not all identical and uniform, so different gas
clouds could shield different amounts of continuum and Hβ
ﬂux.

The disappearance of broad lines as seen in 3% of our sam-
ple (discussed in detail in Section 4.3) has also been docu-
mented before. In particular, Ho & Kim (2009) report that ten
of the 94 objects in their local sample (∼ 11%), selected to in-
vestigate relationships between MBH and host galaxy proper-
ties using Magellan spectra (3600-6000Å wavelength range),

classiﬁed as type-1 Seyferts. (Note that Ho & Kim 2009 do
not discuss this matter further, since it was not the main pur-
pose of their paper.)

In a sample of 117 changing-look quasar candidates se-
lected from SDSS DR12, Ruan et al. (2015) discovers two
new low-redshift quasars (in addition to the one previously
found by LaMassa et al. 2015) where both the broad Hβ and
continuum luminosity dim over the 5- 7 years in rest-frame
time, changing the objects from quasar-like to galaxy-like
states. Ruan et al. (2015) argue that the observed change is
driven by rapidly decreasing accretion rates.

From a sample of 1011 low-redshift quasars (z < 0.63),
selected based on repeated photometry from SDSS and
Pan-STARRS1 as well as repeated spectra from SDSS and
SDSS-III Boss, MacLeod et al. (2015) visually identify ten
changing-look quasars, with 4/10 of these objects showing
emission lines broadening with at least a one magnitude in-
crease in g-band ﬂux and 5/10 of these objects having disap-
pearing broad emission lines and a decreasing light curve (one
of these ﬁve objects was discovered by LaMassa et al. 2015).
One of these ﬁve objects (SDSS J1021+4645) experienced a
type transition from type-1 to type-1.9. MacLeod et al. (2015)
report signiﬁcant changes on timescales of ∼2000-3000 days
with broad emission line changes corresponding to contin-
uum changes. Variable accretion and obscuration were both
discussed as possible options to explain the observed broad-
line changes, and neither possibility was ruled out (MacLeod
et al. 2015). A tidal disruption ﬂare event might explain the
observed changes behind J0159+0033 (MacLeod et al. 2015;
Merloni et al. 2015).

For the purpose of a reverberation mapping campaign,
Barth et al. (2015) re-observed AGNs classiﬁed as Seyfert-
1 galaxies based on SDSS spectra 5-8 years later with the
3m Shane telescope of Lick observatory and noted that for
one object (NGC 6423), all emission lines had disappeared,
and three other objects (Mrk 474, Mrk 728, and Mrk 1494)
changed from Seyfert-1 to Seyfert 1.9. We will discuss possi-
ble explanations for such extreme changes in Section 4.3.

4.2. Quantifying the Observed Broad Hβ-Line Changes
We use several measurements from our spectral decom-
position of the Hβ region discussed in Section 3.2 to fur-
ther quantify the observed broad Hβ line changes and ex-
plore possible origins, particularly in these four quantities:
(i) the second moment of the broad Hβ component (σHβ)
from the model, used to calculate MBH (Bennert et al. 2011,
2015) (ii) the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the
broad Hβ line also sometimes used to calculate MBH (e.g.,
Shen et al. 2008, 2011)2 (iii) the ﬂux ratio of the narrow Hβ

component and [OIII] lines, Hβnarrow/[OIII] (iv) the peak-ﬂux
ratio of the broad and narrow components of the Hβ line,
Hβbroad/Hβnarrow. In Figure 2, we compare these four quan-
tities as derived from the SDSS spectra with those derived
from the Keck spectra.

right: FWHMHβ. Bottom left: Hβnarrow/[OIII] ﬂux ratio. Bottom right:
Hβbroad/Hβnarrow peak ﬂux ratio. The two objects shown in red in this panel
were classiﬁed as 1.9 in the Keck spectrum, thus they do not have a broad
component in Hβ and this comparison uses an upper limit on the ﬂux if a
broad component were included.

On average, the broad Hβ line is wider in the SDSS spec-
tra than in the Keck spectra, both in σHβ (1.07±0.29) and
FWHMHβ (1.08±0.27) (Table 2). Moreover, the broad Hβ
line has more peak ﬂux in the SDSS spectra than in the Keck
spectra (1.26 ± 0.12). The broader and stronger Hβ line pref-
erentially in the SDSS spectra is likely attributed to the bias in
the sample selection, since only objects with a broad Hβ line
were chosen from SDSS.

What is noticeable in the top left panel of Figure 2 is the
large scatter: for individual objects, σHβ can be almost up
to a factor of two different between the two sets of spectra.
FHWM follows a similar trend. Reverberation mapping stud-
ies have shown that the variability of the line-width in AGNs
correlates inversely with the variability of the power-law con-
tinuum in a way that it cancels out in the virial product, re-

sulting in a constant MBH measurement, to within ∼0.05 dex
uncertainty (see, e.g., Bentz et al. 2007; Park et al. 2012;
Barth et al. 2015). Ruan et al. (2015) also ﬁnd that for their
changing-look quasars, the decrease in luminosity coincides
with a broadening of the line widths to preserve the derived
MBH. Unfortunately, we cannot test this correlation in this
paper, because we derive the host-galaxy free continuum ﬂux
from a 2D image decomposition of the SDSS images (Bennert
et al. 2015), taken at yet a different time from the two sets of
spectra. We consider this approach superior over spectral de-
composition, given unknown aperture effects for spectra. (For
the same reason, image decomposition based on typically an
HST image taken at a different time is also used for rever-
beration mapped AGNs (e.g., Bentz et al. 2013).) Moreover,
the Keck spectra are not absolutely ﬂux calibrated due to typ-
ically non-photometric observing conditions. However, using
the same continuum ﬂux, derived from the 2D image decom-
position, but taking into account the different width of Hβ
between the SDSS and Keck spectra, the resulting MBH is on
average 0.05±0.03 dex larger for SDSS spectra. This is small
compared to the uncertainty of single-epoch measurements of
0.4 dex.
(Note that this includes only the 79 objects from
Bennert et al. (2015), since we do not have continuum mea-
surement for the other objects. Also, for obvious reasons, it
excludes any object without broad Hβ emission in the Keck
spectra.)

The lower left panel of Figure 2 shows that while over-
all, the Hβnarrow/[OIII] ﬂux ratio as measured in the SDSS
spectra is comparable to that in the Keck spectra (on average
1.04±0.32) with the majority of the objects falling near the
unity line, the scatter is large due to some extreme outliers.
While the large scatter could partially be due to the change
in broad Hβ (as a consequence of the observed Seyfert-type
change) effecting the narrow Hβ ﬂux for ﬁtting reasons since
the lines are blended, we consider such an effect negligible
given the quality of our data and our ﬁtting procedure. More
likely, it might indicate that the NLR emission lines are not
constant over the timescales of these observations but do in-
deed reverberate, in line with recent studies by Peterson et al.
(2013); Barth et al. (2015).

In the lower right panel of Figure 2, the broad Hβ to narrow
Hβ peak-ﬂux ratio varies quite a bit between SDSS and Keck
spectra (1.26±0.12). This reﬂects the change in the broad
Hβ emission line, and, as a consequence, Seyfert type. On
average, the broad Hβ line is stronger in the SDSS spectra
than in the Keck spectra, most likely due the selection bias.
The change in peak-ﬂux ratio can be used as an independent
way to classify Seyfert-type transitions, as discussed in Sec-
tion 4.1.

Reverberation mapping studies have revealed an anti-
correlation between broad Hβ width and luminosity (Denney
et al. 2009; Park et al. 2012; Barth et al. 2015), which is at-
tributed to the relation between ionizing ﬂux and the local re-
processing efﬁciency of the BLR gas: the Hβ re-processing
efﬁciency is greatest in the outer part of the BLR where the
ﬂux from the continuum is lower (Korista & Goad 2004; Goad
& Korista 2014). Therefore, higher levels of continuum lumi-
nosity lead to an increase in emissivity-weighted BLR radius.
This so-called breathing effect increases ﬂux for low-velocity
line core relative to high-velocity wings, which makes the line
proﬁle narrower. BLR breathing occurs on short timescales
of days to weeks in response to AGN continuum variations.
However, our data do not generally support this special kind
of line variability.

Variable accretion and/or variable obscuration are consid-
ered the two main causes for a type change. As discussed
above, to distinguish between them, the variability in X-ray,
UV, and optical is typically studied. However, we do not
have X-ray data concurring with the SDSS and Keck spec-
tra. Fig. B1–B4 show a qualitative comparison between the
change in Hβ and power-law, overlaying the unsubtracted
spectra of SDSS and Keck for each object, scaled to [OIII].
There are 41/102 (∼40%) objects that have a stronger power-
law emission in Keck than SDSS, for 17/102 (∼17%) it is
the other way around, and 44/102 (∼43%) show no notable
change. The higher fraction of non-stellar (power-law) con-
tinuum in the Keck spectra is explainable by the smaller slit
and sharper seeing.

In other words, both the broad Hβ emission line, as well as
the power-law continuum, are varying between the two set of
spectra. However, when attempting to quantify those changes,
we do not ﬁnd them to be directly correlated. This is not too
surprising, since any variation between broad Hβ emission
and power-law continuum are offset in time depending on the
time-lag of a given object and would not show up at the same
time in a single-epoch spectrum (see e.g., Figs. 7 & 8 in Park
et al. 2012).

Aperture effects may play a role in our results: Keck spectra
(1′′×1′′ square), given the seeing, only include the unresolved
emission from BLR, AGN power-law continuum, and NLR,
while the SDSS spectra (1.5′′ radius circular ﬁber) may addi-
tionally include more extended NLR ﬂux. However, any aper-
ture effect would artiﬁcially boost the ratio of broad-to-narrow
ﬂux in Keck spectra (both peak and integrated) compared to
SDSS spectra, since Keck spectra are restricted to a smaller
central area and thus focus on the unresolved emission. Thus,
aperture effects cannot explain the opposite trend that we are
observing in the majority of objects, namely, that we observe
less broad Hβ in the Keck spectra.

We note that a few objects (e.g., 0909+1330, 1312+2628,
1708+2153, 2140+0025) show signiﬁcantly stronger blue
continuum emission (Fig. B1–B4). This rise in the blue wave-
length range cannot simply be explained by the fact that the
Keck spectra were not obtained at parallactic angle since this
would have the opposite effect. Similarly, none of the SDSS
spectra were taken at large airmasses, with the exception of
2140+0025 that was observed at an airmass of 1.3, which
could have reduced the blue wavelengths emission artiﬁcially
for that object in the SDSS spectrum. To further test whether
the rise in the blue wavelengths emission in the Keck spectra
compared to SDSS is an artifact of Keck ﬂux calibration, we
looked at the spatially-resolved spectra. The rise in the blue
continuum is only present in the central spectra within the see-
ing limits, but not in the outer spectra, suggesting that it is a
real trend. A stronger power-law continuum may indeed ex-
plain the Seyfert-type change observed for 0909+1330 (from
1.8 in SDSS to 1 in Keck) and 1708+2153 (from 1.5 in SDSS
to 1 in Keck).
(Note that the other two objects were clas-
siﬁed as Seyfert-1 in both spectra). However, as mentioned
above, part of this higher fraction of power-law continuum in
the Keck spectra can simply be due to the smaller aperture
and sharper seeing compared to SDSS.

4.3. Extreme Seyfert-Type Changes

For three objects in the sample, the broad Hβ component
was very prominent in the SDSS spectra, but decreased sig-
niﬁcantly and virtually disappeared in the Keck spectra. All
three were re-observed with the 3m Shane telescope of Lick

observatory (Scott 2013). Table 3 summarizes the Seyfert-
type changes of these objects. Note that all Keck objects
classiﬁed conservatively as type-1.9 could be a type-2 object;
however, the spectra do not extend to Hα, so we cannot dis-
tinguish between the two. Especially in those cases where the
Lick spectrum reveals a type-2 object, it is likely that the ob-
ject was also a type-2 in the Keck spectrum. Also note that for
1423+2720, the SDSS spectrum has a low S/N which makes
it difﬁcult to model the underlying broad Hβ line.

The continuum luminosity at 5100Å was compared for all
objects in the sample in order to determine if there was a cor-
relation between AGN luminosity and strongly variable ob-
jects, but no correlation was found.

For all objects, we carefully searched the literature for other
optical spectra. 0847+1824 is the only object for which this
search was successful: It was previously observed on 02-28-
2004 (MJD 53063), before the SDSS observation, and from
that spectrum, the AGN was a type-1 Seyfert (Ho & Kim
2009).

Apart from variable accretion and/or obscuration, we
brieﬂy discuss a few other scenarios which could mimic
changes in Seyfert type.

(i) Telescope offset: First of all, we note that apparent
Seyfert-type changes could be caused by a slight mis-pointing
of the Keck telescope, missing the AGN core and therefore the
(bulk of the) broad emission lines. In all cases, the telescope
was pointed at the center of the galaxy (as veriﬁed by guide
star images), assuming that the AGN resides there. For a cou-
ple of extreme objects, the AGN might actually be offset from
the center, as evidenced by the SDSS images; we will discuss
them below. Note that for all objects for which the AGN core
and BLR coincide with the center of the galaxy, the possibility
of missing the BLR emission due to a telescope offset is neg-
ligible, given the seeing (∼1′′ for the Keck observations) and
the slit width used (1′′, matching the typical seeing), as veri-
ﬁed by standard-star observations. Keck telescope guiding is
also much more accurate than 1′′.

(ii) Galaxy mergers and/or recoiling SMBH: In the course
of ongoing galaxy mergers, the AGN can appear offset from
the apparent center of the merging system. It is therefore pos-
sible that an off-center AGN was captured by the wider, circu-
lar SDSS aperture, but missed during subsequent observation
by the narrower Keck slit, aligned along the major axis of the
galaxy and centered on the galactic nucleus. Alternatively, a
rare gravitational wave recoil following the ﬁnal coalescence
of two SMBHs in a merger, can remove the newly formed sin-
gle SMBH from the center of its host galaxy (e.g., see the re-
view by Sperhake 2015). The accretion disk and BLR would

remain bound, and a recoiling SMBH would therefore appear
as an AGN offset from the core of its host galaxy (Komossa
2012), again leading to the possibility of missing the (bulk of
the) BLR in the more narrow (and rectangular) Keck slit.

With the exception of a few cases (4/102, see Bennert et
al. 2015); there are no signs for merger activity in the sam-
ple. However, we caution that merger signatures such as faint
tidal tails might easily be missed in the low S/N SDSS images.
Objects 0847+1824 and 1038+4658 show extended emission
in the SDSS multi-color images, offset from the galaxy cen-
ter (Fig. D), which might indicate the presence of an ongoing
merger. While we cannot exclude the possibility that these
are off-center AGNs, it is statistically unlikely to have off-
centered AGNs in such a small sample, and follow-up spec-
troscopy would be needed to test such a scenario further. We
note in passing that 0847+1824 seems to show a small kine-
matic offset between its narrow and broad Hβ line (with the
broad Hβ line being blue-shifted by ∼100km s- 1), which is,
however, most likely mimicked by the asymmetric broad line
proﬁle.

(iii) Supernovae: A type IIn supernova has many of the
same spectral features as a Seyfert galaxy (Filippenko 1997).
A nuclear supernova could have therefore mimicked the pres-
ence of an AGN. However, supernova spectra including the
narrow emission lines evolve rapidly, and we do not see any
other signs of dramatic changes in the continuum and narrow
emission lines.

(iv) Stellar tidal disruption event: Stars can be tidally dis-
rupted and accreted by SMBHs, producing a luminous ac-
cretion ﬂare (e.g., Rees 1988). If these occur in a gas rich
environment, broad and narrow emission lines can be tem-
porarily excited. While a few candidate events for this process
have been identiﬁed recently from SDSS (e.g., Komossa et al.
2008), these events are rare, and are unlikely to occur in our
small sample. In particular, we have checked the long-term
Catalina lightcurves of all three sources, and none shows the
characteristic lightcurve decline expected for a typical tidal
disruption event.

We are left with mild changes in accretion or extinction
as most likely explanation for the three changing-look AGN
in our sample. Future spectroscopic monitoring of emission-
line and continuum changes will enable us to distinguish be-
tween both possibilities. (Note that a difference in aperture
between Keck and SDSS cannot explain the extreme Seyfert-
type changes we observe in these three objects since it would
have the opposite effect.)

To further shed light on the causes for the observed vari-
ability, we considered the optical light curves in the Catalina
Sky Survey (CSS) (Drake et al. 2009). With the excep-
tion of 1104+4334 and 1206+4244, all objects in our sam-
ple are in the CSS archive.
(Note that 1605+3305 is in
the archive, but it does not have a light curve available.)
For most objects, CSS light curves begin after the SDSS
observations, but extend past
the time of the Keck and
the light curves start and end at ap-
Lick observations;
proximately ∼53500- 56500 MJD (∼3000 days). The light
curves of seven objects (0310-0049, 0904+5536, 1147+0902,
1355+3834, 1434+4839, 1535+5754, 1557+0830)3 reveal
large variability (∼0.5-1mag in one object) over time-scales
from days to months to years. None of these objects are
amongst our extreme subset of objects (see Table A1 for
Seyfert types).

Since CSS photometry is aperture based (Drake et al. 2009),
we cannot exclude that a variable seeing can mimic variabil-
ity since more or less of the host galaxy would be included in
an aperture centered on the AGN. However, especially the ex-
treme variability in these seven objects is unlikely to be purely
a seeing effect.
Independent analysis, which is beyond the
scope of this paper, is needed to further conﬁrm the observed
variability.

5. SUMMARY

In this paper, we study the broad Hβ emission-line variabil-
ity in a sample of 102 local Seyfert-1 galaxies, selected from
SDSS and re-observed 3-9 (on average 6.4±1.8) years later
with LRIS on the 10m Keck-I telescope.
In the 3 - 9 year time-frame between observations, 67/102
(∼66%) objects show at least some form of variability of ei-
ther width and/or strength of the broad Hβ line. For 39/102
(∼38%) objects, this variability is signiﬁcant enough to result
in a change in Seyfert type, following the standard Seyfert
classiﬁcation scheme. There is no correlation between the
time between observations and the degree of the observed
Seyfert-type transition, implying that the transitions happen
on shorter time scales. Short-time variability on the scale of
days and weeks is known for low-mass AGNs from reverber-
ation mapping. Almost all objects (99/102) were observed as
part of the CSS with 7/102 (∼7%) displaying signiﬁcant vari-
ability on time scales of days to weeks.

Three (∼3%) objects are extreme cases for which the broad
Hβ component almost completely disappears. We discuss

ther inspection, it becomes clear that that is an artifact of a bright nearby
star.

possible origins for these transitions. For two of these objects
(0847+1824 and 1038+4658), SDSS images reveal extended
emission off-centered from the galaxy center that could have
been included in the SDSS spectra, but missed by the smaller-
area Keck slit centered on the galaxy.

The study presented here is the ﬁrst to provide statistical in-
formation on the frequency and strength of Hβ line variability
in a sample of low-redshift Seyfert galaxies.

Note. — Col. (1): Target ID based on R.A. and Dec. used throughout the text. Col. (2): Right ascension. Col. (3): Declination. Col. (4): Redshift from SDSS-DR7. Col. (5):
Date SDSS spectrum was taken (with Modiﬁed Julian Date (MJD) in brackets). Col. (6): Seyfert-type classiﬁcation based on SDSS spectrum. Col. (7): Date Keck spectrum was
taken (with MJD in brackets). Col. (8): Seyfert-type classiﬁcation based on Keck spectrum. Note that because Keck spectra do not extend to Hα, we cannot differentiate between
type-1.9 and type-2, and conservatively classify these objects in question as type-1.9. Col. (9): Exposure time of Keck observations in seconds. Note that the exposure time for all
SDSS spectra is 54 seconds. Col. (10): Time between SDSS and Keck observations in years. Col. (11): Date Lick spectrum was taken (with MJD in brackets). Col. (12): Seyfert-type
classiﬁcation based on Lick spectrum.

Note that values in brackets are estimated from upper limits on the broad Hβ ﬂux for objects classiﬁed as Sy 1.9 or Sy 2, that is without an obvious broad Hβ component. No width (FWHM or σ) of broad Hβ is given in those cases. Also note that for
object 1655+2014 the signal-to-noise ratio was too low in both SDSS and Keck spectra to produce a reliable ﬁt to the Hβ region. No values are given for this object and it is not included in the quantitative analysis.

Figure B1. Unsubtracted spectra comparing SDSS (black) and Keck (red) (3850-7000Å). Note that the Keck spectra only cover the blue part. For comparison,
the base of the 5007Å [OIII] line is set to 0 and the peak to 1 to make the data sets comparable as discussed in the text. Objects shown in this ﬁgure are included
in Bennert et al. (2015).

Figure C1. Multi-component spectral decomposition of the Hβ region in SDSS spectra. In the upper region, the observed spectrum is shown in black with
the best-ﬁt of the continuum, FeII, and host galaxy starlight in magenta. Below that the best-ﬁt to the power-law continuum is shown in green with the stellar
spectrum in yellow. Below this, the narrow lines of Hβλ4861, and [OIII] λλ4959,5007 are shown in blue, the broad and narrow components of HeII λ4686 in
brown, and the broad component of Hβ in red. The residuals are plotted in black (arbitrarily shifted downward for clarity). Note that the objects shown here are
included in Bennert et al. (2015) who show the corresponding ﬁt to the Keck spectra in their Figure 3.

Figure D1. SDSS multi-color image for 0847+1824 (left; taken roughly a year before the SDSS spectrum, on 12-13-2004) and 1038+4658 (right; taken roughly
10 months before the SDSS spectrum, on 02-08-2002). For 0847+1824, there is extended emission offset ∼1′′ to the north-east of the galaxy center. For
1038+4658, an emission blob can be seen ∼2.5′′ to the south-west of the galaxy center. In both cases, the extended emission might have been missed in the Keck
spectra due to the smaller width longslit (with a position angle not covering the emission), but included in the 3′′ ﬁber of SDSS.
