Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions play a key role in several condensed mat-
ter, cosmology and nuclear physics theoretical models1,2. Its observation in real systems is
often hampered by ﬁnite temperatures and limited control of the system parameters. In
this work we report for the ﬁrst time the experimental observation of the full quantum
phase diagram across a transition where the spatial parity symmetry is broken. Our sys-
tem is made of an ultra-cold gas with tunable attractive interactions trapped in a spatially
symmetric double-well potential. At a critical value of the interaction strength, we observe
a continuous quantum phase transition where the gas spontaneously localizes in one well
or the other, thus breaking the underlying symmetry of the system. Furthermore, we show
the robustness of the asymmetric state against controlled energy mismatch between the two
wells. This is the result of hysteresis associated with an additional discontinuous quantum
phase transition that we fully characterize. Our results pave the way to the study of quan-
tum critical phenomena at ﬁnite temperature3, the investigation of macroscopic quantum
tunneling of the order parameter in the hysteretic regime and the production of strongly
quantum entangled states at critical points4.

Parity is a fundamental discrete symmetry of nature5, conserved by gravitational, electromagnetic and
strong interactions6. It states the invariance of a physical phenomenon under mirror reﬂection. Our world
is pervaded by robust discrete asymmetries, spanning from the imbalance of matter and antimatter to the
homo-chirality of DNA of all living organisms7. Their origin and stability is a subject of active debate.
Quantum mechanics predicts that asymmetric states can be the result of phase transitions occurring at
zero temperature, named in the literature as quantum phase transitions (QPTs)1–3. The breaking of a
discrete symmetry via a QPT provides also asymmetric states that are particularly robust against external
perturbations. Indeed, the order parameter of a continuous symmetry breaking QPT can freely (with no
energy cost) wander along the valley of a ”mexican hat” Ginzburg-Landau potential (GLP) by coupling
with gapless Goldstone modes8. In contrast, the order parameter of discrete symmetry-breaking QPTs
is governed by a one dimensional double-well GLP9. The reduced dimensionality suppresses Goldstone
excitations and the order parameter can remain trapped at the bottom of one of the two wells. This
provides a robust hysteresis associated with a ﬁrst order QPT.

Evidences of parity symmetry breaking has been reported in relativistic heavy-ions collisions10 and
in engineered photonic crystal ﬁbers11. Observation of parity symmetry breaking in a QPT has been
reported for neutral atoms coupled to a high-ﬁnesse optical cavity12. However this a strongly dissipative
system with no direct access to the symmetry breaking mechanism necessary to study the robustness of
asymmetric states. In addition, previous theoretical studies13,14 have interpreted the puzzling spectral
properties of a gas of pyramidal molecules that date back to the 50s15, in terms of the occurence of a
QPT with parity symmetry breaking.

In the present work we report the observation of the full phase diagram across a QPT where the
spatial parity symmetry is broken. Our system consists of ultra-cold atoms trapped in a double-well
potential16,17 where the tunable strength of the attractive interparticle interaction is the control parameter
of the transition. Additional control of the energy mismatch between the two wells allows driving of
discontinuous ﬁrst order quantum phase transitions in the non-symmetric ordered part of the phase
diagram and observation of an associated hysteretic behavior.

H = Ha + gHb, where Ha = R dr Ψ†(r)[− 2

In our system the atomic ground state depends on two competing energy terms in the Hamiltonian
2m∇2 + V (r)]Ψ(r) includes kinetic and potential energy,

3

m

R dr Ψ†(r)Ψ†(r)Ψ(r)Ψ(r) accounts for contact interaction between the atoms. Here, Ψ(r) is

Hb = 2π2a0
the many-body wave function (in the following we consider normalization hΨ†(r)Ψ(r)i = 1), m the atomic
mass, a0 is the Bohr radius and V (r) is a double-well trapping potential in the x direction, see Fig. 1a,
and a harmonic trap in the orthogonal plane. The adimensional control parameter g = N as/a0 < 0 is the
product of the total number of atoms N and the scattering length as < 0 characterizing the interatomic
attractive interaction. The full many-body Hamiltonian is invariant under x ↔ −x mirror reﬂection. This
parity symmetry imposes a spatially symmetric ground state for any value of the control parameter g.
Since Ha and Hb do not commute, the corresponding ground states are quite diﬀerent. Ha is minimized
by each atom equally spreading on both wells. A ﬁnite energy gap, speciﬁed as tunneling energy J,
separates the ground and the ﬁrst (antisymmetric) excited state of Ha. J can be tuned by controlling the
height of the potential barrier between the two spatial wells. In contrast, gHb is minimized by a linear
combination of two degenerate states, one having all atoms localized in one well, the second with all
atoms localized in the other well. Because of the competition between the two terms in the Hamiltonian,
the energy gap between the two low-lying states vanishes (strictly equal to zero in the thermodynamic
limit N → ∞, as → 0) at a ﬁnite critical value of the control parameter gc. For g > gc the tunneling
energy dominates and the system is in a symmetric conﬁguration. For g ≤ gc, when interactions prevail,
the system becomes exponentially sensitive to arbitrarily small ﬂuctuations of the energy of the two wells.
This forces the majority of atoms to localize randomly in one well or the other, see Fig 1a. The broken
symmetry is characterized by a non-zero order parameter that, in our case, is the normalized atomic
population imbalance z = (NL − NR)/N, where NL and NR are the number of atoms occupying the left
and the right well, respectively.

In order to measure z across the phase transition (see Fig. 1b) we adopt the following experimental
procedure: We start by cooling a gas of N = 4500 atoms well below the Bose-Einstein condensation
point until no thermal fraction can be detected (see Methods). The atoms are initially trapped in a
harmonic potential, with a positive scattering length as = 3a0. We reach diﬀerent target values of g,
above and below the critical point, by continuously transforming the harmonic trap into a double well,
up to a certain barrier height and tunneling J ≈ 40 Hz, and by tuning the interatomic scattering length
to negative values (see Methods). When g > gc, we ﬁnd the system in a parity-symmetric disordered

4

phase, with order parameter z ≈ 0 within error-bars. Below the critical value, i.e. for g < gc, an ordered
phase emerges with z driven away from zero. The phase transition can be theoretically described by an
1 − z2, where ˜g = gU /J is the normalized control parameter and U is the
eﬀective GLP W(z) = ˜g
bulk energy (see Methods). When ˜g crosses the critical value ˜gc = −1, the shape of W(z) continuously

changes from a parabola to a double well (see Fig. 1c) with minima located at z = ±q1 − 1/˜g218. The

2 z2 − √

continuous variation of z indicates the occurrence of a continuous phase transition. From the experimental
measurements of the order parameter we obtain a critical value ˜gc = −1.3 ± 0.2, in fair agreement with
the theoretical prediction.

A one-dimensional GLP, which depends on a single real parameter, describes a phase transition with
the breaking of a discrete symmetry as, for instance, the left-right symmetry in our case, or the spin-
up/spin-down symmetry in the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition3. In these systems, a controlled
symmetry-breaking term (in our case provided by an energy gap δ between the two wells, see Fig. 2a)
drives a ﬁrst-order QPT in the ordered region of the phase diagram. This can be understood from
the sudden variation of the absolute minimum of the GLP W(z) + δz when tuning δ from positive to
negative values, as shown in Fig. 2b. We characterize this QPT, by repeating the previous experimental
procedure, above and below the critical point, but adding to the ﬁnal potential conﬁguration a ﬁnite
and controlled value of δ. As shown in Fig. 2c, for g > gc, the order parameter z changes smoothly as
dδ| (measured around z = 0). Increasing the strength
a function of δ, with a ﬁnite susceptibility χ = | dz
of the attractive interaction causes z to depend more and more critically on δ, and χ diverges at the
critical point. Performing the susceptibility measurements for g < gc we observe an abrupt jump of z
when crossing the value δ = 0, signaling the onset of the ﬁrst-order phase transition.

The full phase diagram where the interplay of the observed discontinuous (ﬁrst-order) and continuous
(second-order) QPTs is summarized in Fig. 4a. We identify the universality class of the parity-symmetry
breaking QPT from the susceptibility measurement. A ﬁt of χ as a function of the interaction strength
according to χ = α/(g − gc)γ is shown in Fig. 3. The two ﬁtting parameters are γ and α. We obtain a
critical exponent γ = 1.0± 0.1, in agreement with the Ginzburg-Landau prediction γ = 1 (see Methods).
Therefore, our QPT belongs to the universality class of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick19 model.

Discrete-symmetry models are characterized by metastability and hysteresis when driving the system

5

across the ﬁrst-order transition. Both follow directly from the 1D nature of the eﬀective GLP. We notice
that bifurcation and hysteresis are typical phenomena in the dynamics of systems governed by a nonlinear
equation of motion18,20,21. In our system, the origin of hysteresis can be understood from the shape of the
GLP W(z)+ δz, which, for ˜g < −1 and |δ| < δc = [(−˜g)2/3−1]3/2 shows an absolute minimum and a local
one, see Fig. 4b and Methods. The latter corresponds to a metastable point with a a lifetime depending
on the macroscopic quantum tunneling rate of the order parameter through the eﬀective GLP. This rate
is exponentially smaller than the interwell tunneling rate of the single atoms in the double-well trap. To
demonstrate hysteresis in our system, we set J ≈ 30 Hz, add an energy gap δ0 and prepare a condensate
in the well with lower energy (for example the right one, with δ0 = −4J < 0 and z ≈ 1). We then shift
the relative energy of the two wells to a ﬁnal value δ in 500 ms, keeping J constant, and measure the order
parameter after a short waiting time of 10 ms (green circles in Fig. 4c). The experiment is performed
for diﬀerent values of the control parameter g. When g < gc, the strong attractive interaction between
atoms forces the condensate to remain localized in the right well even when its energy minimum is lifted
above the left well. When δ overcomes a critical value δc, a spinoidal instability drives the gas down to
the left toward the absolute minimum of the trapping potential in a timescale ≈ 10 ms, a fraction of 1/J.
An analogous behavior is observed with an initial imbalance z ≈ −1 (orange circles in Fig. 4c), forming
an hysteresis loop. The area of the hysteresis loop decreases with increasing g and disappears for g > gc,
see Fig. 4c.

This work paves the way to the study of macroscopic quantum tunneling in the hysteretic regime in the
context of the quantum-to-classical transition problem22. Furthermore it will also be possible to explore
quantum criticality at ﬁnite temperature as consequence of the competition between thermal ﬂuctuations
and quantum correlations24. In addition it will be interesting to explore spontaneous symmetry breaking
in gas mixtures as a function of the interspecies interactions23. Finally our system will allow investigation
of the creation of entanglement at the critical points4 as a resource for precision measurements25 and
other quantum technologies26.

METHODS

Double-well potential. The double-well potential is created by intersecting at a small angle of 0.1
radiants two pairs of laser beams of wavelengths λ = 1064 nm and λ/2 = 532 nm which propagate almost
perfectly collinearly. The interference of the four lasers creates in the horizontal x direction a primary
lattice and a secondary lattice with 10 µm and 5 µm spacing, respectively. Together they form an array
of double-well traps27. Note that the resonance wavelength for 39K is 767 nm. During the evaporation28 a
“cross” beam (∼ 25 µm waist, 1070 nm wavelength) allows to load a Bose Einstein condensate (BEC) in
a single site of the primary lattice. Slowly increasing the intensity of the secondary lattice it is possible
to convert the initial harmonic trapping potential into a double-well trap. Controlling the relative phase
and frequency of the two wavelengths it is possible to control the position of the barrier and eventually
introduce an energy gap δ between the two wells. The experiments regarding the second-order phase
transition are performed with a primary (secondary) lattice depth of 26 (19) nK which provides a tunneling
energy of 40 Hz. The measurements reported in Fig. 2 have been performed starting with a condensate
with slight repulsive interactions initially trapped in a single site of the primary lattice. In order to set
the ﬁnal target value of J and g, we adopt the following experimental procedure. In 100 ms we tune
the scattering length to the ﬁnal desired negative value (thus setting g). We then rise in 500 ms the
secondary lattice continuously transforming the harmonic trap into a double well (thus setting J). The
timescale of the sequence is chosen so to minimize the excitations when the system crosses the transition,
but short enough to neglect three-body loss processes.

BEC with tunable interactions. The experiments are performed with atoms in the F = 1, MF = 1
internal state across a magnetic Feshbach resonance at 402 Gauss29. The magnetic-ﬁeld stability allows
a tuning of the scattering length better than 0.1 a0. Condensates of 4600±400 atoms with a scattering
length of 3 a0 form in a single site of the primary lattice with a longitudinal trapping frequency of 160
Hz. An additional radial beam at 1064 nm, collinear with the lattice, provides a radial conﬁnement of
ω = 180 Hz. The temperature of the gas is a fraction of the lattice depth and is then well below the
condensation temperature (TC ≈ 130 nK).

model (see Methods). Diﬀerent panels correspond to diﬀerent values of g/|gc|. Large error bars signify the dynamical
breaking of metastability corresponding to oscillation of the gas between the two wells.

atomic imbalance z for ﬁve diﬀerent values of the control parameter g with a bin size of 0.1. The numerical values
reported on the ﬁgure indicate the ratio g/gc. The red curves are the results of a double Gaussian ﬁt described in
Methods.
