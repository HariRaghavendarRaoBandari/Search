B : Dtriv(B)

Abstract. A key result in a 2004 paper by S. Arkhipov, R. Bezrukavnikov, and V. Ginzburg [ABG]
compares the bounded derived category Dbblock(U) of modules for the principal block of a Lusztig quan-
tum enveloping algebra U at an ℓth root of unity with a subcategory Dtriv(B) of the derived category of
integrable type 1 modules for a Borel part B ⊂ U. Speciﬁcally, according to this “Induction Theorem”
[ABG, Theorem 3.5.5] the right derived functor of induction IndU
B yields an equivalence of categories
RIndU
→ Dbblock(U) (under appropriate hypotheses on ℓ). The authors of [ABG] suggest a
similar result holds for algebraic groups in positive characteristic p, and this paper provides a statement
with proof for such a modular induction theorem. Our argument uses the philosophy of [ABG] as well as
new ingredients. A secondary goal of this paper has been to put the original characteristic zero quantum
result on ﬁrmer ground, and we provide arguments as needed to give a complete proof of that result
also. Finally, using the modular result, we have been able in [HKS] to introduce truncation functors,
associated to ﬁnite weight posets, which eﬀectively commute with the modular induction equivalence,
assuming p > 2h − 2, with h the Coxeter number. This enables interpreting the equivalence at the level of
derived categories of modules for suitable ﬁnite dimensional quasi-hereditary algebras. We expect similar
results to hold in the original quantum setting, assuming ℓ > 2h − 2.

1. Introduction

If G is a semisimple algebraic group and B a Borel subgroup, it is well known that the category
of rational G-modules fully embeds via the restriction functor into the category of rational B-modules.
Explicitly describing the objects in the image of restriction is a diﬃcult problem, unsolved in general.
However, as we will see here, it is possible to make progress at the derived category level. Our starting
point is a result [ABG, Theorem 3.5.5] by S. Arkhipov, R. Bezrukavnikov, and V. Ginzburg in the world
of quantum groups. The result establishes a natural equivalence between the bounded derived category
of modules for the principal block of a Lusztig quantum enveloping algebra at a root of unity with
an explicit subcategory of the bounded derived category of integrable modules for a Borel part of this
quantum algebra. We will refer to this result as “the induction theorem.” We begin this paper with its
explicit statement.

Suppose U is a Lusztig quantum algebra, associated to a root datum R = (Π, X, Π∨, X∨), and spe-
cialized to a characteristic 0 ﬁeld K with ℓth root of unity q ∈ K, as deﬁned in section 2. In particular,
we assume q is deﬁned by qℓ = 1 with ℓ odd, and not divisible by 3 if the root system corresponding
to R has a component of type G2. We denote the root system in general by R. Moreover, we assume
ℓ > h, where h is the Coxeter number of R, unless otherwise noted. Suppose B = U − ⊗K U 0 ⊂ U is a
‘Borel part’ of U arising from a triangular decomposition of U as in Section 2. Denote by Dbblock(U ) the

bounded derived category of the abelian category of type 1 integrable modules in the “principal block”
of U .1 For Db(B) the usual bounded derived category of the module category for B, let Dtriv(B) be the
full triangulated subcategory of Db(B) whose objects are complexes representable by

M = · · · → Mi−1 → Mi → Mi+1 → · · ·

i ∈ Z

so that for all i ∈ Z,

(i) Mi is an integrable B−module;
(ii) Mi has a grading Mi = ⊕ν∈YMi(ν) by the root lattice Y of the root datum R;
(iii) for any m ∈ Mi(ν) and u ∈ U 0, um = ν(u) · m;
(iv) the total cohomology module H •(M) = ⊕i∈Z H i(M) has a ﬁnite composition series, all of whose

successive quotients are of the form KB(ℓλ), λ ∈ Y.

Here KB(ℓλ) denotes a 1-dimensional B-module associated to ℓλ. Further details on notation may be
found in Section 2.

Theorem 1. [Induction Theorem, Theorem 3.5.5 [ABG]] For an appropriately deﬁned induction functor
IndU

B yields an equivalence of triangulated categories

B , its right derived functor RInd U

Dtriv(B) ∼→ Dbblock (U ).

A precise deﬁnition for IndU

It is an analog of induction (right adjoint to
restriction) in the theory of representations of algebraic groups, and has similar properties. To “induce”
a module, one applies induction in the sense of associative rings and algebras, then passes to the largest
type 1 integrable submodule.

B appears in Section 2.

The present paper contains, as a secondary feature, a complete proof of the above result, along the
lines of [ABG], though with some variations and a number of corrections. We are grateful to Pramod
Achar for alerting us to possible issues (ﬁrst observed by his collaborator, Simon Riche) in the proof of
[ABG, Lemma 4.1.1(ii)]. The argument we eventually found (the proof of our Lemma 3.2(ii)) is quite
substantial, spanning two appendices and improving a theorem of Rickard [R94]. Other corrections
we make are more minor, often rooted in inadequacies in the quantum literature. The “variations”
mentioned often occur from our desire to give a proof that “carries over” to the characteristic p algebraic
groups case. Indeed, the latter has been the central aim of our work here.

The existence of a modular analog of the induction theorem was suggested by the assertion [ABG, p.
616]: “An analogue of Theorem 3.5.5 holds also for the principal block of complex representations of the
algebraic group G(F ) over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0. Our proof of the theorem
applies to the latter case as well.” Replacing the term “complex representations” in the quote above
with “rational representations” (likely intended) yields the statement below, which this paper conﬁrms
is indeed a theorem. However, while the philosophy and some ingredients of the proof we present may
be found in the [ABG] treatment of the quantum case, additional critical ingredients are also required.
See, for example, Corollary 2.15(1) and Lemma 3.6.

To set the notation, block (G) is the principal block of ﬁnite-dimensional rational G-modules, and
Dtriv(B) is deﬁned analogously to Dtriv(B) in the quantum case. That is, rational B-modules replace
(Type 1) integrable B modules, the distribution algebra of a maximal split torus T ⊆ B is used for
U 0, and kB(pλ), with k as below, replaces KB(ℓλ) above (in the deﬁnition of Dtriv(B), which becomes
Dtriv(B)). As before h denotes the Coxeter number of the underlying root system, now regarded as
associated to G.

1More precisely, the principal block of U is the full subcategory of ﬁnite-dimensional integrable type 1 U-modules whose
composition factors are all “linked” to the trivial module. Equivalently, the highest weights of these composition factors
all belong to the “dot” orbit of 0 under the aﬃne Weyl group. A precise deﬁnition of the “dot” action is given in Section
2.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

3

Theorem 2. Let G be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of positive
characteristic p > h. Let B be a Borel subgroup of G. Then the functor RInd G
B yields an equivalence
of triangulated categories

Dtriv(B) → Dbblock (G).

Generally, we use the “quantum case” to refer to the context of Theorem 1, and the “algebraic groups
case” (or “positive characteristic case,” or “modular case) when referring to the context of Theorem 2.
Of course, some discussions in a given ”case” do not require the full hypotheses of these theorems. (We
sometimes keep track of such situations.)

Theorem 2 is a starting point for yet another result, proved in [HKS]. It shows, for p > 2h − 2, that

RIndG

B in Theorem 2 induces an equivalence between certain natural full triangulated subcategories

Dtriv(Dist(B)Λm) → Db(block (G)Γm ),

depending on p and indexed by an integer m > 0. Λm is a ﬁnite subposet in a variation of van der
Kallen’s “excellent order” on weights [vdK1], and Γm is a ﬁnite subposet of dominant weights in the
usual dominance order. The arguments Dist(B)Λm and block (G)Γm of the constructions in the display
refer to ﬁnite-dimensional quasi-hereditary algebra quotients of the distribution algebra Dist(B) and
Dist(G), respectively, the latter associated to G–a mild abuse of notation.

For further details, see [HKS]. Collectively, these more “ﬁnite” equivalences can be used to reconstruct

the full equivalence given by RIndG

B in Theorem 2, thereby deepening our understanding of it.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 collects notation and some needed background ma-
terial. Section 3 proves Theorems 1 and 2. The statements above these theorems contain the start
of a dictionary for going back and forth between the characteristic 0 quantum root of unity case and
the positive characteristic algebraic group case.
Indeed, there is nothing to stop us from using the
same names as in Theorem 1 for parallel objects in Theorem 2, putting U = Dist(G), B = Dist(B),
block (U ) = block (G), Dtriv (B) = Dtriv (B ), and even writing RIndU

B. We can then restate

B for RIndG

Theorem 2.1 (Cosmetic variation on Theorem 2) Let U be the distribution algebra of a semisimple
algebraic group over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of prime characteristic ℓ = p > h. Let B be the
distribution algebra of a Borel subgroup. Then the induction functor RIndU

B induces an equivalence

Dtriv(B) → Db block(U ).

In Section 3 we give a simultaneous proof of both Theorem 1 and the above version of Theorem 2.

Some of the rationale for the overall approach is discussed in subsection 3.5. Sections 4, 5, and 6
present three appendices, labeled A, B, C, respectively. The ﬁrst two are used to prove Lemma 3.2(ii),
which restates [ABG, Lem. 4.1.1(ii)], asserting that it holds in both the quantum and modular algebraic
groups cases. The modular case, at least, is of independent interest of categorifying a theorem [R94,
Thm. 2.1] of Rickard in the regular weight case, and the quantum case of the lemma may be viewed as
giving an analogous quantum result. Also, Appendix C, independent of the rest of this paper, corrects
the statement and proof of [ABG, Lem. 9.10.5] as a service to the reader. Appendix C was previously
labeled and quoted as “Appendix,” in previous versions of this paper. Finally, a few acknowledgements
and thanks are collected in the ﬁnal section.

Theorem 2 was ﬁrst announced in [HKS], though the proof underwent several corrections after that,
the last in August, 2015, when a proof of Lemma 3.2(ii) was written down. This was done in the modular
case, and completed our proof of the modular induction theorem. The proof actually also works in the
quantum case, thus proving [ABG, Lem. 4.1.1(ii)], though we found it necessary to work through some
foundational issues regarding quantum induction (Remarks 2.11(d),(e)). We also found it necessary to
ﬁll in other details in the quantum literature to complete our simultaneous treatment of the quantum
and modular induction theorems. Another proof of the modular induction theorem, as part of a larger
geometric program, has recently been posted by Achar and Riche [AR].

2. Background

Generally, we follow Lusztig [L5], [L3] for basic material on quantum enveloping algebras, and Ander-
sen’s paper [A] for many additional results on their representation theory, especially results on induced
representations that parallel those found in Jantzen [J] in the case of semisimple algebraic groups. These
results on induced representations have their origin in an earlier paper of Andersen-Polo-Wen [APW], as
supplemented by [AW]. For the study of (characteristic zero) quantum groups at ℓth roots of unity with
ℓ a prime power, the [APW] paper is generally suﬃcient, while the context of [AW] allows all values ℓ
(orders of roots of unity) used in (the main results of) this paper. (It does restrict ℓ to be odd, and
not divisible by 3 in case the root system has a component of type G2.) The context of [A] is even
more general, though it references an argument from [AW], and there are a number of references of
convenience (which could be avoided) to arguments in [APW].

We are interested in the semisimple algebraic groups case as much or more so than in the quantum
case, but focus now on giving notation below as beﬁts the quantum case, where there is much less
uniformity in the literature than in the algebraic groups case. All the notation and results have analogs
in [J], however. In later parts of this paper, excluding the appendices, we will try to treat both the
algebraic groups and quantum cases simultaneously and with the same notation. Some of our quantum
group notation has been chosen to maintain consistency with these later discussions.2 Some important
background on induction and cohomology is given in subsection 2.5, modifying and completing a number
of references given by [ABG] to the literature on quantum group representations. Many of the results
we discuss in that subsection are well-known in the algebraic groups case, and we generally do not track
their analogs there in detail. Starting with subsection 2.6 and continuing in the rest of Section 2 and
all of Section 3, we use the “uniform” notation for both the quantum and positive characteristic cases,
though some diﬀerentiation of the two cases is sometimes required for proofs. Appendices A and B, used
to prove Lemma 3.2, are given in algebraic groups notation, with the quantum case treated in remarks.
A compact quantum group reference written in the spirit of comparing general results in the quantum
and algebraic groups cases may be found [J, Appendix H] in summary form.

2.1. Quantum Enveloping Algebras and Algebraic Groups.

2.1.1. Root Datum. Assume gC is a complex semisimple Lie algebra of rank n, with Cartan matrix
C = (cij)1≤i,j≤n, and Killing form κ : gC × gC → C. Then from a choice of Cartan subalgebra hC ⊂ gC
one obtains a root-datum realization R = (Π, X, Π∨, X∨) of C from the following data.

C denotes the set of roots arising from the Cartan decomposition gC = hC ⊕ Lα∈R gC ,α
C -weight spaces under the restriction of the adjoint action of gC to hC , with corresponding
C obtained from the
C , tφ ∈ hC to be the unique element

• R ⊂ h∗
into h∗
elements tα ∈ hC , tα ↔ α ∈ R arising from the identiﬁcation of hC with h∗
nondegeneracy of the Killing form by setting, for any φ ∈ h∗
such that φ(h) = κ(tφ, h) for all h ∈ hC .

• Take as the set of coroots R∨ := {α∨ := 2α

(α,α) | α ∈ R}. For hα := 2tα

κ(tα,tα), there is a correspondence

hα ↔ α∨ under the identiﬁcation of hC with h∗
C .

• Take E = EQ ⊗Q R, for EQ the Q−span of the roots R in h∗

C . The rational space EQ has a
nondegenerate bilinear form obtained from restriction of (λ, µ) = (tλ, tµ) on h∗
C ; this extends
uniquely to a positive deﬁnite form (−, −) on E, making E into an n-dimensional Euclidean
space. Both R and R∨ are root systems in E; in particular they both span E. Observe that, for
< ζ, η >:= 2(ζ,η)

(η,η) ∀ζ, η ∈ E, one has < β, α >= (β, α∨) for α, β ∈ R.

• The Weyl group W is the subgroup of GL(E) generated by reﬂections sα(v) = v−(v, α∨)α, α ∈ R.

2In some cases, our notation diﬀers from [ABG]. In particular we use a “simply connected” set-up, which allows modules
with weights in X (deﬁned below), rather than the “adjoint” set-up of [ABG], which restricts attention to modules with
weights in Y below (the root lattice). This does not aﬀect the triangulated categories (up to natural equivalences) entering
into the statements of Theorems 1, 2 and 2.1. Also, we always induce from Borel subgroups associated to negative roots,
and correspondingly use a diﬀerent (but more standard) aﬃne Weyl group “dot” action, deﬁned later in subsection 2.4.2.

2.1.2. Quantum Enveloping Algebra. Our description of quantum enveloping algebras here follows Lusztig
[L3], with similar notation, especially for generators. There are some diﬀerences in the notational names
of algebras and subalgebras, and the labeling of relations. We make no distinction in the terms “quantum
enveloping algebra,” “quantum algebra,” and “quantum group.”

Z [ibid]. Also, the root of unity
specializations discussed in the next section inherit Hopf algebra structures from U Z , as do the “small”
quantum groups u, u−, u0, u+[ibid].The (“Frobenius”) homomorphism discussed later in section 2.7 is a
homomorphism of Hopf algebras.

2.2. Quantum specializations at roots of unity–notation. For any commutative ring K and in-
vertible element q ∈ K, with unique accompanying ‘evaluation morphism’ ǫq : Z → K satisfying v 7→ q,
deﬁne the specialization of U Z = U Z (R) by

(2.0.4)

U q,K = U Z ⊗Z K,

where the tensor product is formed by using the Z-module structure on K given by ǫq. For this paper
we will be interested in specializations where

• K is a ﬁeld of characteristic zero
• q is a primitive ℓth-root of unity in K with ℓ odd, and ℓ 6= 3 if the root system of g has a

component of type G2.

5This is the form employed in [A] (and also [J, Appendix H]). In [ABG, 2.4], a version of Lusztig’s integral form is given
very loosely, but apparently intended to be deﬁned by an “adjoint type” version of the relations we use here. The latter
relations, however, appear to be consistent with the alternate “simply connected” development suggested [ABG, Remark
2.6], a point of view we have used throughout this paper.

6These additional expressions in the Ki are redundant–see the brief discussion [A, p.3, bottom]–but are needed for the

integral triangular decomposition.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

7

We henceforth ﬁx this meaning for K, ℓ, q, unless otherwise noted. We also take ℓ > h, the Coxeter
number7, from Corollary 2.10 forward. We also now introduce further notation that will be used in
this quantum root of unity setting, and also used in a parallel setting from algebraic groups, discussed
below. Relatively abbreviated notations are chosen to facilitate later parallel discussions. In the present
quantum context, we let U denote the specialization U q,K as in (2.0.4). Similar conventions are adapted
for U +, U 0, U − and B = U 0 · U −. Lusztig’s ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra [L3, §8.2] (the “small”
quantum group) is denoted u, with components of its triangular decomposition denoted u−, u0, u+. For
example, u0 is generated by all K ±
i , and u− is generated by all the Fi [L3, pp.107-108]. Imitating the
notation in [ABG] we set b := u− · u0 and p := b · U 0.

Overall, our notation here is quite similar to that used for quantum groups at a root of unity in [ABG],
with the exception that our characteristic 0 ﬁeld K (which may be compared with k in [ABG]) is not
assumed to be algebraically closed. Also, our B is U 0 · U −, whereas in [ABG] the same symbol B is used
to denote U 0 · U +.

2.3. Some parallel algebraic groups notation. Let G be a simply connected semisimple algebraic
group, with root datum R, over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic p > h. We assume G
is deﬁned and split over the prime ﬁeld Fp. In particular there is a Borel subgroup B = T U, with U
the unipotent radical of B, and T a maximal torus, all deﬁned over Fp, with T isomorphic (over the
same ﬁeld) to a direct product of copies of k×. The root groups in B are viewed as negative. We
refer to this set-up as the algebraic groups context or, even more loosely, as the algebraic groups case.
The distribution algebras Dist(G), Dist(B), Dist(T ), Dist(U), and Dist(G1) (the restricted enveloping
algebra) parallel U , B, U 0, U −, and u, respectively. We will use the latter symbol set in place of the
former, when the context is clear, or if both the algebraic groups and quantum contexts have been
explicitly allowed.
In either of these circumstances, additional notational substitutions in the same
spirit may also be made, such as p for Dist(B1T ).

2.4. Aﬃne Weyl Groups. Aﬃne Weyl groups Wℓ are used to index modules in both the quantum
and algebraic groups context, with p used for ℓ in the latter. Our main references for aﬃne Weyl groups
are [J] and [A]. To clarify discussions and diﬀerences in these references, we temporarily allow ℓ to be
any positive integer.

2.4.1. Aﬃne Weyl Groups, as in [J]. Following e.g., the conventions and notation in [J, §6.1], for β ∈ R
and m ∈ Z, deﬁne the aﬃne reﬂection on X by

one could take X ⊗Z R in place of X. Thus, for the reﬂections sβ given by sβ(λ) = λ − (λ, β∨)β one has

sβ,m(λ) = λ − (λ, β∨) − m)β,

∀λ ∈ X;

For any positive integer ℓ, the aﬃne Weyl group Wℓ is the group

sβ,m(λ) = sβ(λ) + mβ ∀λ.

Wℓ :=< sβ,nℓ | β ∈ R, n ∈ Z > .

∼= Wa(R∨), for Wa(R∨) :=<
In the notation used in [J, §6.1], there is a (largely formal) isomorphism Wℓ
sβ,m | β ∈ R, m ∈ Z >, as deﬁned by Bourbaki [B, ch. VI, §2]. When ℓ = 1 this isomorphism
is an equality. The Bourbaki reference makes a good case for the labelling with R∨, though it is
common in algebraic group theory to associate both Wℓ and Wa(R∨) with the root system R. A familiar
semidirect product description is obtained by regarding ℓZR as a group of translations on X ⊗Z R,
∼= ℓZR ⋊ W = ℓY ⋊ W ([J] references [B, ch. VI§2 prop. 1] for a proof). Here W is the
namely, Wℓ
usual Weyl group associated to R.

7All these restrictions agree in substance with those in [ABG], though h there denotes the dual Coxeter number. Also,
the literature diﬀers as to whether q is chosen to be the image of v or the image of v2, the latter ﬁtting somewhat better
with Hecke algebra notation. This makes little diﬀerence when the order of the image of v is odd, as is the case here.

2.4.2. Dot Action. Set ρ = 1

2 Pα∈R+ α. For w ∈ W, λ ∈ X, one sets,

More generally, the aﬃne Weyl group Wℓ

w · λ = w(λ + ρ) − ρ.
∼= ℓY ⋊ W acts, for wa := ℓτ ⋊ w ∈ ℓY ⋊ W by

wa · λ := w(λ + ρ) − ρ + ℓτ,

for all λ ∈ X.

Our “dot” action · , which is often used, is not given by the same formula as the action • deﬁned in [ABG],
possibly intending some variation on [ABG, Lem. 3.5.1] (which is incorrect as stated for “positive” Borel
subalgebras). A simpler approach, it seems to us, is to use “negative” Borel subalgebras and the usual
“dot” action.

2.4.3. Aﬃne Weyl Groups as in [A]. Take q ∈ K to be a root of unity. (In [A] the ﬁeld K can have any
characteristic, though that is not relevant to our discussions here, and we may keep our assumption that
K has characteristic 0.) Set ℓ to be the order of q2, so that q is a primitive ℓth or 2ℓth root of unity. For
the Cartan matrix C of R and symmetrization DC (as at the end of our Section 2.1.1), set ℓi =
gcd(ℓ,di) .
For each β ∈ R, there is some i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n so that β is conjugate under the Weyl group W of R to αi.
Set ℓβ = ℓi (well-deﬁned). For each β ∈ R and m ∈ Z, as in Section 2.4.1, we have the aﬃne reﬂection
sβ,mℓβ with

ℓ

sβ,mℓβ · λ = sβ · λ + mℓββ ∀λ ∈ X.

Here, sβ and sβ · λ are deﬁned just as in Sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2. Now deﬁne a new group of aﬃne
reﬂections

Take W ∨

ℓ to be the group

WD,ℓ :=< sβ,mℓβ | β ∈ R, m ∈ Z > .

W ∨
ℓ

:=< sβ∨,nℓ | β ∈ R+, n ∈ Z >,

generated by reﬂections as in Section 2.4.1, but utilizing coroots in place of roots. The following
proposition relates the three groups Wℓ, WD,ℓ, and W ∨
ℓ .

Proposition 2.1. Assume R is indecomposable. There are identiﬁcations giving inclusions

Wℓ ⊆ WD,ℓ ⊆ W ∨
ℓ

so that

(i) If gcd(di, ℓ) = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, then Wℓ = WD,ℓ.
(ii) On the other hand, if gcd(di, ℓ) 6= 1 for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n, then WD,ℓ = W ∨
ℓ .

Proof. Without loss, some di 6= 1. Since R is assumed to be indecomposable, all di 6= 1 take the same
value d ∈ {1, 2, 3}. If d does not divide ℓ, ℓi = for all indices i, and it follows that ℓ = ℓβ for all β ∈ R.
Consequently, WD,ℓ = Wℓ. On the other hand, if d does divide ℓ, then dβ∨ = β and dℓβ = ℓ for all
long β ∈ R, and β∨ = β for all short roots β. It follows that WD,ℓ = W ∨
in this case. This proves the
ℓ
proposition.
Q.E.D.

Remark 2.2. We have included Proposition 2.1 in part to address possible confusion that a reader
casually comparing [J] and [A] may encounter. [A, p.6] says “Note that if ℓ is prime to all entries of the
Cartan matrix, then the group WD,ℓ (denoted Wℓ in [A]!) is the ‘usual’ aﬃne Weyl group of R. However,
in general WD,ℓ is the aﬃne Weyl group of the dual root system”. As we have pointed out above, the “
‘usual’ aﬃne Weyl group” in algebraic groups discussions is Wℓ as deﬁned in [J] and Section 2.4.1 above,
∼= Wa(R), rather than
and that“the aﬃne Weyl group on the dual root system” referred to by [A] is W ∨
ℓ
Wa(R∨). The proposition and our previous discussion perhaps make precise what Andersen intended.
In any case, in this paper, under the assumption below (2.0.4) that ℓ be odd, and not divisible by 3 in
case the root system has a component of type G2, it is clear from the proposition that Wℓ = WD,ℓ.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

9

2.5. Induction and Cohomology. We continue the notation of Section 2.4.3 above, appropriate for
Andersen’s paper [A]. This is somewhat more general than our standard assumptions stated below
(2.0.4). Those more special assumptions are all that we need for this paper, and are explicitly used as
hypotheses in [AW]. The latter paper, along with some arguments of [APW] could possibly be used as an
alternate source for some of the results of this subsection, with the standard assumptions below (2.0.4)
as hypotheses. Unfortunately, it is not possible to quote [APW] directly, since its standing assumptions
eﬀectively require ℓ to be a prime power. (See [APW, Lem. 6.6], [AW, p.35].) On the other hand, [A]
contains explicit statements (with weaker hypotheses) of most of the results we need, with the exceptions
tractable with modest eﬀort.

Accordingly, we follow [A] using the notation for K, q, ℓ in the previous subsection. In addition, we
use the notation U q,K as in (2.0.4), though with more general assumptions than those below (2.0.4). We
will deﬁne induction functors Ind U q,K
from the category of integrable Bq,K-modules of Type 1 to the
B q,K
category of integrable U q,K-modules of Type 1 (both categories deﬁned below). For the moment, we will
not use our preferred U , B, . . . notation, to help remind the reader of our slightly diﬀerent context, with
weaker hypotheses. Of course, we will obtain from this construction the induction functors Ind U
B whose
right derived functors are the focus of this paper.

q,K via the homomorphism χλ : U 0
c ∈ Z, and t ∈ N . For any U 0

We begin as in [A, §1]. First, we coordinate the notation X in our section 2.1.1 with the “weights”
Zn, given in [A, p.3]. The correspondence is simply to let λ ∈ X correspond to the n-tuple with ith
coordinate λi =< λ, α∨
i >. Then, as in loc. cit., λ deﬁnes a 1-dimensional representation of (what we
q,K → K sending K ±
call here) U 0
. Here
q,K-module M, let Mλ denote the sum of all 1-dimensional
1 ≤ i ≤ n,
submodules on which U 0
q,K acts via the homomorphism χλ. We will call Mλ the “weight space” for M
associated to λ. If M is the sum (necessarily direct) of its weight spaces Mλ, λ ∈ X, we say that M
is integrable of Type 1 as a U 0
q,K-module. If we start with M a B-module (resp., a U -module), we say
that M is integrable of Type 1 as a B-module (resp., as a U -module) if it is integrable of Type 1 as a
q,K-module, and each vector v ∈ M is, for each index i, killed by all F (s)
U 0
for s suﬃciently large (resp.,
killed by F (s)

i to q±diλi and (cid:2) Ki;c

t (cid:3) to (cid:2) λi+c

for s suﬃciently large).

t (cid:3)di

i

and E(s)

i

Next, suppose that V is any U q,K-module. Deﬁne

(2.2.1)

F (V ) := {v ∈ ⊕λ∈X Mλ | E(r)

i v = F (r)

i v = 0 ∀i = 1, . . . , n and ∀r >> 0}.

According to [A, p.5], the submodule F (V ) is a Type 1 integrable U q,K-module. 8 We can now deﬁne

(2.2.2)

H 0

q (M) := F (Hom B q,K (U q,K, M)),

(M), later to be written in this paper as Ind U

for any Type 1 integrable Bq,K-module M. This yields a Type 1 integrable U q,K-module which we call
the induced module Ind U q,K
B (M). (Andersen uses the word
B q,K
“induction,” but does not use our notation for the induced module, preferring instead H 0
q (M).) In the
deﬁnition of H 0
q (M) above, left multiplication of Bq,K on U q,K provides the Bq,K-module structure on
U q,K, and a U q,K-module structure on Hom B q,K (U q,K, M) is given by uf (x) = f (xu) for all u, x ∈ U q,K
and f ∈ Hom B q,K (U q,K, M). The categories of Type I integrable Bq,K-modules and U q,K-modules have
enough injectives (as may be seen from the ring cases, applying the “largest Type 1 integrable submodule
functors,” such as F above)) and, hence, the left exact functor Ind U q,K
q has right derived functors
B q,K
RnInd U q,K
B q,K

= H n
q .

= H 0

8No argument is given in [A], noting the property is “not hard to check.” Perhaps this is true, once one knows how to
do it. An argument for the case of (positive or negative Borel) subalgebras may be obtained with the method of [L, proof
of Lem. 3.5.3], but using the generalized quantum Serre relations (through their corollary [L, Cor. 7.1.7]) in place of the
quantum Serre relations. The case of the full quantum enveloping algebra then reduces to the rank 1 case, which can be
handled with the formulas [L, 3.14(b),(c)].

Deﬁnition 2.3. For ≤ the usual order on X determined by the positive roots R+, set µ, λ ∈ X to
be linked if µ = w · λ for some w ∈ WD,ℓ. If there is a chain λ = λ1, . . . , λs = µ and a sequence
· λi, i = 1, . . . , s − 1, then µ is strongly
sβ1,m1ℓβ1
linked to λ, denoted µ ↑D,ℓ λ.

for which λi ≥ λi+1 := sβi,miℓβi

, . . . , sβs−1,ms−1ℓβs−1

Remarks 2.4. (1) The relationship of strong linkage for weights X reﬁnes that of the usual ordering ≤.
That is, µ ↑D,ℓ λ implies µ ≤ λ.

(2) In the analogous char(k) = p > 0 representation theory of algebraic groups, one deﬁnes µ ↑ λ
for weights µ, λ ∈ X by using the aﬃne Weyl group Wℓ, ℓ = p, in place of WD,ℓ. In this circumstance,
under mild restrictions on the prime p relative to the root system R, one has Wp = WD,ℓ, by Proposition
2.1(1).

Let Cq denote the category of Type 1 integrable U q,K-modules. The following fundamental result
ultimately yields a splitting of Cq into a direct sum of blocks associated to orbits of an appropriate
aﬃne Weyl group. For application to the Induction Theorem 1, we will just need the version U of U q,K
described below (2.0.4) in which case WD,ℓ = Wℓ. We will then focus on block(U ), the principal block
of Cq, corresponding to the orbit WD,ℓ ·0. (Composition factors Lq(µ) of modules in the block are indexed
by dominant weights µ in the orbit.) However, the results below hold more generally. They are claimed
in [A] under the standing hypotheses of this subsection on q, K, ℓ, even with K allowed to have positive
characteristiic. However, it should be pointed out that the only reference given in support of one key
auxilliary result [A, Thm. 2.1], a Grothendieck vanishing theorem needed in the proofs, is to the paper
[AW]. The latter has as one of its standing assumptions that ℓ be odd, and not divisible by 3 in case the
root system has a component of type G2. This assumption on ℓ is, of course, satisﬁed by our U , so we
have not pursued the issue further. Possibly, it was the intent of Andersen to claim that the argument
in [AW] worked in the more general set-up of [A], though there is no explicit comment to that eﬀect.

Theorem 3. (1) (Strong Linkage Principle [A, Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.13]) Let λ ∈ X+ − ρ. (Thus,
λ + ρ ∈ X+.) Let µ ∈ X+. If Lq(µ) is a composition factor of some H i
q(w · λ) with w ∈ W and i ∈ N ,
then µ ↑D,ℓ λ.

(2) (Linkage Principle [A, Thm. 4.3, Cor. 4.4]). Let λ, µ ∈ X+. If Ext 1

Cq(Lq(λ), Lq(µ)) 6= 0, then λ is
linked, but not equal to, µ. Consequently, if M ∈ CU is indecomposable, then the highest weights of all
composition factors of M are linked, and the category Cq splits into blocks corresponding to the orbits
for the dot action of WD,ℓ on X+.

Proof. We refer the reader ro [A] for the proofs, on which we we make several remarks which may be
helpful. First, note that there appears to be a serious misprint, an expression apparently carried over
unintentionally to one result from a previous one, in the statement of the auxiliary result [A, Prop. 3.6]:
In the expression “< λ, α∨

i >= −1”, the subexpression “= −1” should be replaced with “≥ 0”.

Next, note that the exact sequences labeled (3) and (4) of [A, p.8] exist (and are later used) in the
case s = 1 of the discussion there, with all terms in both exact sequences sequence equal to zero. (The
reader might have been led by the wording to think these sequences were deﬁned only for s > 1.)

Next, there is an organizational issue on [A, p.10]. The ﬁrst three lines of the proof of [A, Cor. 3.8]
do not use the “minimality” hypothesis of that corollary, and are implicitly quoted later on the same
page, in the proof of [A, Thm. 3.8], where it is claimed “we have already checked the result for w = 1.”
There are further minor points which occur on the same page [A, p.10]. In one repeated case, the
vanishing of H 0
q on 1-dimensional nondominant B-modules is given without proof, or hint. One approach
that works is to use the version proved in the rank 1 case, then use induction from a corresponding
parabolic subalgebra (and a Grothendieck spectral sequence).

At another place on the same page, [APW] is quoted to help determine, using a Weyl group action,
the highest weight of a module H 0
q (kλ). However, an alternate argument may be given directly from
the induced module deﬁnition. Quoting [APW] in this context is undesirable, because of the (implicit)
restrictive set-up of that paper regarding ℓ. A similar issue, which we already noted above, before the

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

11

statement of theorem, regards the reference to [AW] for a proof of [A, Thm. 2.1]. As noted above, the
generality of the [AW] set-up is suﬃcient for applications in this paper.

Finally, the “splitting into blocks” is justiﬁed in [A] by corollary [A, Cor. 4.4]. Both the corollary and
the splitting are made a straightforward consequence of [A, Thm. 4.3] by the local ﬁniteness of Type 1
integrable modules, for which we refer ahead to Proposition 2.8 below.
Q.E.D.

The paper [A] gives some history of the Theorem 3, most of which had been proved piecemeal previ-
ously by Andersen and his students and collaborators. There is, of course, a completely corresponding
theorem–ﬁrst proved in full generality by Andersen– for semsimple algebraic groups, as discussed in
Jantzen’s book [J]. With a certain amount of hindsight, some conceptual similarities can be imposed
on the proofs and statements of supporting results.
In particular, the presentation in [J] of Strong
Linkage for the algebraic groups case ([J, II 6.13]), working with X+ rather than X+ − ρ, breaks the
proof down into a lemma and two propositions [J, II 6.15, 6.16]. We have combined these propositions
into an X+ − ρ quantum analogue stated below. We need this extra detail (for X+) in order to provide
more precise information about the appearance of irreducible modules Lq(µ) as composition factors in
appropriate cohomology modules. H i
q(ν). The Theorem [A, Thm. 2.1], discussed above, is needed in
the proof (beyond the use of Strong Linkage).

Proposition 2.5.

with λ ∈ X+ − ρ, then µ ↑D,ℓ λ. If ℓ(w) 6= i, then µ < λ.

(1) Let i ∈ N and w ∈ W . If Lq(µ), µ ∈ X+ is a composition factor of H i

q(w · λ)

(2) Suppose λ ∈ X+. Then Lq(λ) is a composition factor with multiplicity one of each H ℓ(w)

q

(w · λ)

with w ∈ W.

Proof. The ﬁrst part of item (1) just repeats Strong Linkage. The second part of item (1), and item
(2), can be deduced from the approach in the proof of [A, Thm. 3.9]. Note that any weight µ in that
proof which arises from the application of [A, Lem. 3.7] is strictly less than λ. As a consequence, the
argument shows, in the presence of Strong Linkage, that the lemma holds for i and w if and only if it
holds for i + 1 and sw (assuming sw >). This property can be applied repeatedly, moving i up or down.
Using it, as in the ﬁrst three lines of the proof of [A, Cor. 3.8], we obtain item (1) of the proposition.
(This uses the discussed [A, Thm. 2.9].) Similarly, item (2) is reduced to the case i = 0 and w = 1. Here
it follows by showing, directly from the deﬁnition, that λ has a 1-dimensional weight space in H 0
q (λ).
This completes the proof of the proposition.
Q.E.D.

We remark that the discussions above of results in [A] corrects the proof of [ABG, Lem. 3.5.1]. This is
with our choice of “negative” Borel subalgebras and our (standard) “dot” action. Both [A] and [APW]
use ”negative” Borel subalgebras as we do. The statement of the lemma given by [ABG] is apparently
an attempt to use [APW] in a “positive” Borel subalgebra context, but the lemma is still incorrectly
stated for that context. Also, they quote [APW] for the proof, though the latter paper does not contain
as strong a result [ABG, Lem. 3.5.1] Instead, the main result [APW, Thm. 6.7] of its Borel-Weil-Bott
section is a “lowest ℓ alcove” version, and explicitly requires that ℓ be a prime power.

The next corollary restates the main conclusions (those dealing with X+) of the proposition above in
a form handy for later use. As already indicated, the (completely analogous) algebraic groups version
is the combination of the two propositions [J, II 6.15, 6.16].

Corollary 2.6. If µ ∈ X and λ = w · µ ∈ X(T )+ (i.e., λ is the dominant weight in the W −orbit
of µ), then Lq(λ) occurs just once as a composition factor of any of the modules H i
q(µ), i running
over all nonnegative integers. Precisely, one has [H i
q(µ) : Lq(λ)] 6= 0 only for i = ℓ(w), and then
[H ℓ(w)
q(µ) : Lq(η)] 6= 0 implies η < λ and
that η is strongly linked to λ

(µ) : Lq(λ)] = 1. If η ∈ X+ with η 6= λ, then for all i ∈ N , [H i

q

The proposition below is quite important for applications, especially in the next subsection. There
is a completely analogous result for induction from Borel subgroups in reductive algebraic groups, a
special case of [J, II,4.2].

The ﬁnal proposition in this section, also useful in the next section, is an analogue in the generality

latter results, however.

Proof. . For this proof, let U +
j denote, for each index j, the Z span (a subalgebra) in U Z of all the
elements E(s)
j . Lusztig constructs his PBW-type basis [L3,
Thm. 6.7] for the quantum enveloping algebra U Z using (ﬁnitely many) compositions of his explicit
braid group automorphisms Ti, applied to the various U ±
j . This process yields, for each positive root α,
Z-subalgebras U ±
α , and the whole quantum algebra U Z is a (ring-theoretic) product of ﬁnitely many of
these, together with U 0
Z .

In several formulas listed in [L, 37.1.3] Lusztig gives explicit formulas for several similar automor-
phisms, including their action on basis elements of each U ±
j . The setting for the action of these auto-
morphisms is a Q(v)-algebra U containing the algebra we have called U ′
v; moreover, the action of these
automorphisms on the various elements Ki (in the notation of [L]) shows that all these automorphisms
act bijectively on U ′
v. It is easy to pick out the braid group automorphism Ti deﬁned in [L3] in this
context, as (the restriction to U ′
i,1 in [L, 37.1.2]). Accordingly, we learn, for each index j, that
Ti(U ±
Z and at most three Z subalgebras, each of the latter having the
form U ±
j ′′, for some index j′′ (in 1, . . . , n). To this information we add the fact that Ti stabilizes U 0,
which may be deduced from [L3, Thm.3.3,Thm.6.6(ii),Thm.6.7(c)].

sition.

2.6. Some derived category considerations. We ﬁnally begin to use the assumptions and notation
ﬁrst given below (2.0.4, which the reader should review at this point. The notations include a common
notation U for a quantum enveloping algebra, specialized at an ℓth root of unity, and the distribution
algebra of a simply connected semisimple algebraic group G. There are similar common notations
associated to various subalgebras of U , and distribution algebras associated to subgroups of G, such as
the (negative) Borel subgroup B. Both p > h and ℓ > h are required, and there are further conditions
on ℓ. (It must be odd, and not divisible by 3 when the root system of U has a component of type G2).
In addition, we introduce here the notations CU , CB , . . . for the categories of Type 1 integrable U , B, . . .-
modules, respectively, in the quantum case. In the algebraic groups case, the same notations reference
the categories of rational G, B, . . .-modules, respectively. These latter categories may be rewritten,
according to our conventions for naming distribution algebras, as the categories of rational U , B, . . .-
modules. Here, “locally ﬁnite” would be a more accurate term than “rational,” but we will use either
term in unambiguous contexts.

This section provides a starting point for the proof of the Induction Theorems 1 and 2, the latter as
reformulated in Theorem 2.1. The result below, a corollary of the those in the previous subsection, is
the starting point. The statement and proof work in both the quantum and algebraic groups context,
in the notation discussed above.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

13

By block(U ) we mean the category of ﬁnite dimensional modules in the principal block of CU ; equiva-
lently, it is the full subcategory of all ﬁnite-dimensional modules whose composition factors have highest
weights in Wℓ · 0 (taking ℓ = p in the algebraic groups case).

By Dbblock(U ) we mean the bounded derived category of the abelian category block(U ), as deﬁned
by Verdier–see, for example, [Ha, Chapter I]. Let Db
block(U )(CU ) denote the full subcategory of Db(CU )
consisting of objects which have each of their (ﬁnitely many) cohomology groups in block(U ). Using the
local ﬁniteness of rational modules (see Proposition 2.8 in the quantum case), we observe the following
lemma.

Lemma 2.9. The natural map Dbblock(U ) → Db(CU ), arising from the inclusion functor at the abelian
category level, induces an equivalence

Dbblock(U ) ∼= Db

block(U )(CU )

.

Proof. Let K • be a bounded complex of objects in CU with each cohomology group belonging to block(U ).
We claim there is a bounded subcomplex F • of K •, with ﬁnite dimensional objects in CU in each degree,
such that the inclusion map F • ⊆ K • is a quasi-isomorphism. To construct the subcomplex F •, we
may assume, inductively, its terms in all degrees ≥ i are constructed, so that they form a subcomplex
F ≥i. In addition, we require, inductively, that inclusion of this complex into K • induces an isomorphism
on cohomoology in grades > i and an epimorphism on the ith cohomology groups. Then, we wish to
construct F i−1 ⊆ K i−1 so that the resulting complex F ≥i−1 has the analogous properties for i−1 in place
of i. Let δ denote the diﬀerential K i−1 → K i. Then δ(K i−1) ∩ F i is, of course, both ﬁnite and contained
in the image of δ. Choose a ﬁnite dimensional subspace E of K i−1 such that δ(E) = δ(K i−1) ∩ F i,
Also choose a ﬁnite dimensional subspace E′ of the Kernel of δ such that the image of E′ in the natural
surjection Ker δ → H i−1(K •) is all of H i−1(K •). Take F i−1 to be the U -module generated by E + E′.
Then δ(F i−1) = δ(K i−1)∩F i. Consequently, inclusion induces a monomorphism H i(F ≥(i−1)) → H i(K •).
The (downward) induction hypothesis implies the same map is a surjection, so it must be an isomorphism.
Our construction of F i−1 gives a surjection of H i−1 for the same inclusion of complexes. The inductive
step may be repeated, eventually reaching cohomological degrees j where K j and all lower degree terms
are 0. At that point we may take F j also zero, and zero in lower degrees. This gives that F • ⊆ K •
induces an isomorphism on all cohomology groups. That is, it induces a quasi-isomorphism, as required
in the claim.

We remark further, that, by taking block projections, the complex F • may be assumed to consist in

each degree of objects in block(U .

The lemma proposes that the natural map induces an equivalence.

It follows from the claim and
remark that every object on the right-hand side of the proposed equivalence is, indeed, in the strict
image of the left hand side. It remains to show the natural map induces a full embedding at the derived
category morphism level. For this, observe the claim above can be strengthened so that the constructed
complex F • contains any given ﬁnite dimensional subcomplex N • of K •. (Strengthen the induction
hypothesis in the proof by adding the assertion N ≥i ⊆ F ≥i. Then, at the inductive step, replace E by
E + N i−1; this does not eﬀect δ(E), since δ(N i−1) ⊆ δ(K i−1) ∩ Fi.) As before, if N • is a complex of
objects in the principal block, we may assume the complex F • constructed is also a complex of objects
in the principal block.

Taking the same idea yet another step further, we can even assume F • contains any given ﬁnite
number of subcomplexes like N •, since the sum of any number of ﬁnite subcomplexes of K • is again a
ﬁnite subcomplex.

Now use the standard direct limit constructions (in the second variable) of derived category mor-
phisms. Here we mean the Verdier localization construction of derived categories (and bounded de-
rived categories), which proceeds (ﬁrst) by localization of homotopy categories of complexes. (See [Ha,
pp.32,37].) In particular any morphism on the right hand side from an object M •
2 is represented
2 → K •, the latter a quasi-isomorphism. Now

2 are ﬁnite dimensional complexes of objects in block(U , and let N •

assume M •
2 be their
respective images in K •. Applying the strengthened versions of the claim, above, we may construct a
ﬁnite dimensional complex F • containing both N •
2 , and contained in contained in K •. Moreover,
the latter inclusion is constructed to be a quasi-isomorphism.
It follows that the pair of morphisms
M •
2 → F • represent a derived category morphism on the left hand side of the display in
the lemma. This proves the surjectivity required in the full embedding property at the morphism level.
It remains to prove injectivity. Suppose we are given a morphism on the left hand side of the display
which becomes zero on the right hand side. The morphism on the left may be represented by the
2 and J •, all ﬁnite dimensional complexes of objects in
following conﬁguration: We are given M •
block(U ), and a pair of morphisms M •
2 → J •, the latter a quasi-isomorphism. To say that
the derived category morphism represented by this conﬁguration becomes zero, when considered on the
right hand side, means the following: There is a complex K • of objects in CU and a quasi-isomorphism
1 → J • → K • is homotopy equivalent to zero.
J • → K • such that the composite map of complexes M •
1 → K i−1 is
Let h = {hi}i∈Z be a family of maps deﬁning the homotopy in question. That is, each hi : M i
1 → J • → K •. Here the subscripted symbols δ
a morphism in CU , and δK • ◦h+h◦δM •
denote the evident families of diﬀerentials. Observe that the sum L• over i of all δK i−1 ◦ hi(M i
1) + hi(M i
1)
is a ﬁnite dimensional subcomplex of K •, with all of its objects and diﬀerentials in block(U ) Using
the extended claims above, we can construct a ﬁnite dimensional block(U )-complex F •, contained in
K • as a CU -subcomplex, and itself containing each of L•, the image of J • in K •, and the image of
M •
In addition, the above constructions allow us to assume that
that the inclusion F • ⊆ K • is a quasi-isomorphism. It follows that J • → F • is a quasi-isomorphism.
Consequently, the derived category morphism (viewed as a direct limit) represented by the original
2 → J • → F •. However,
conﬁguration is also represented by the pair of maps M •
the map M •
1 → J • → F • is visibly homotopic to zero, using the same function h to deﬁne the required
1) ⊆ F i−1 for each i.) Thus, the morphism represented by the original
homotopy. (By construction hi(M i
conﬁguration is zero in its associated direct limit. This proves the required injectivity and completes
the proof of the lemma.

It is suggested below [A, Defn. 3.5.6] that, in the quantum case, block(U ) is “known” to have
enough injectives. There is such a result about injectives in [APW]. But the contest, while possibly
too restrictive, ostensibly applies only to the cases where ℓ is a prime power, as do the discussions in
[APW2]. Our argument above does not depend on such a property, and, indeed, applies to the algebraic
groups case, where there are no ﬁnite-dimensional injectives.

Though it is somewhat informal, we henceforth identify Dbblock(U ) and Db

block(U )(CU ) through the

isomorphism above. This language is used in the result below.

Proof. The linkage principle, Corollary 2.6 and Proposition 2.7 imply item (i) above. Corollary 2.6, used
with induction on weights and standard cohomological degree truncation operators [BBD, p.29], implies

item (ii).

Remarks 2.11. (a)The result above is stated as Cor. 3.5.2 in [ABG] in their quantum enveloping
algebra set-up. Their proof, overall, relies on similar considerations, though some of the references
supplied to [APW] for their preparatory lemma [ABG, Lem. 3.5.1] are inaccurate. It is not clear if their
proof applies to the case where ℓ is not a prime power.

(b) This is perhaps a good point to mention that Kempf’s vanishing theorem, well-known in the
algebraic groups case [J, II,§4], also holds [AW, Thm. 5.3] in the quantum case under the hypotheses
of this section. Thus, the higher derived functors RnInd U
B (µ) are zero for µ dominant and n > 0. The

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

15

generalized tensor identities [J, I,Prop.4.8] also work here [AW, Prop.4.7]. These results are stated
using individual higher derived functors Rn in each degree n ≥ 0, but their proofs show that there
are isomomorphisms RIndU
B (M) ⊗ N whenever M ∈ CB and N ∈ CU . These
isomorphisms may also be deduced from the natural maps in (d) below, applied with M replaced by an
injective resolution.

B (M ⊗ N|B) ∼= RIndU

(c) The roles of left and right in the tensor identity may be reversed.

(See (d) below. The ﬁrst
argument for such a reversal is probably that for [APW, Prop. 2.7].) Also, although the quantum
algebras we deal with are not generally cocommutative (U 0 being an exception), the orders of tensor
products of integrable modules we deal with can often be interchanged (up to isomorphism). This holds
in particular for tensor products of ﬁnite dimensional modules in CU . See [L, 32.16]. We have, however,
not investigated the naturality properties this reversal may or may not have. The reversal is natural in
the tensor identity case, as can be seen from (d) below. If M there is then replaced by a complex of
injective modules, a natural reversal is obtained in the generalized tensor identity case.

(d) It is sometimes useful to have explicit natural isomorphisms

αM,N : Ind U

B (M ⊗ N|B ) −→ Ind U

B (M) ⊗ N; and

γN,M : Ind U

B (N|B ⊗ M) −→ N ⊗ Ind U

B (M)

where M ∈ CB, N ∈ CU . We give such natural isomorphisms for the convenience of the reader:
Drop the subscripts M, N and regard both modules in the top row as a contained in Hom k(U , M ⊗ N).

We have, for f ∈ Ind U

B (M ⊗ N|B ), x ∈ U ,

α(f )(x) = (1 ⊗ S(x2))f (x1)

in (implicit sum) Sweedler notation. (Thus ∆(x) = x1 ⊗x2, a sum over an invisible implicit index shared
by x1, x2.) To check B-equivariance of α(f ), let h ∈ B. Then

α(f )(hx) = (1 ⊗ S((hx)2))f ((hx)1)

= (1 ⊗ S(x2)S(h2))f (h1x1),

where the last line is a sum over two implicit and independent indices, one for the x′s and one for the
h′s. Continuing, we obtain further similar expressions

= (1 ⊗ S(x2)S(h3))(h1 ⊗ h2)f (x1)
= (1 ⊗ S(x2))(h1 ⊗ S(h3h2)f (x1)
= (1 ⊗ S(x2))(h1 ⊗ Sǫ(h2))f (x1)
= (1 ⊗ S(x2))(h1 ⊗ 1)f (x1)
= (h ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ S(x2))f (x1)
= (h ⊗ 1)α(x)

which is the desired equivariance. Notice the top line is, for any ﬁxed x1, x2, the image of h ∈ B
△
under a linear map B
−→ B ⊗ B ⊗ B −→ M. Here △ denotes, with some abuse of notation, the map
usually denoted (1 ⊗ △) ◦ △ or (△ ⊗ 1) ◦ △, with △ : B −→ B ⊗ B the comultiplication. We write
both ∆(h) = h1 ⊗ h2 and ∆(h) = h1 ⊗ h2 ⊗ h3, depending on context. The inverse β of α is given, for
g ∈ Ind U

B (M) ⊗ N ⊆ Hom k(U , M ⊗ N), x ∈ U , by

β(g)(x) = (1 ⊗ x2)g(x1).

We leave it to the reader to check that β(g) satisﬁes the appropriate B-equivariance (by an argument
B (N|B ⊗M) ⊆

similar in spirit to that for α), and that β is inverse to α. The formula for γ, is for f ∈ Ind U
Hom mathbbk(U , N ⊗ M), x ∈ U ,

For the inverse δ of γ it is, for g ∈ N ⊗ Ind U

B (M) ⊆ Hom mathbbk(U , N ⊗ M), x ∈ U ,

γ(f )(x) = (S(x1) ⊗ 1)f (x2)

δ(g) = (x1 ⊗ 1)g(x2)

16

TERRELL L. HODGE, PARAMASAMY KARUPPUCHAMY, AND LEONARD L. SCOTT

Again, the reader may check, with arguments similar in spirit to those illustrated, that γ amd δ satisfy

the appropriate equivariance properties and are inverse to each other.

(e) We remark that IndU

B (M) is equipped with a natural “counit” ǫM : IndU

B (M)|B −→ M which, as
is well-known (see Wikipedia) may be used its property of being right adjoint to restriction. In the full
module categories for U and B ǫM may be given as evaluation at 1 on the right adjoint Hom B(U , M),
and it follows that ǫM may be similarly interepreted for Ind U
B (M) when dealing with integrable modules.
We only want to observe here that there is a similar “evaluation at 1” counit for each of the modules
IndU
B (M) above, providing each of these construc-
tions with the structure of a right adjoint to restriction. The proof is easy, noting the isomorphisms
in (d) commute with evaluation at 1 on the ambient Hom B(U , −) module. Rewriting this fact in the ǫ
notation, we have that ǫM ⊗ N|B and N|B ⊗ ǫM are counits (that is, provide a right adjoint structure)
for Ind U

B (M), respectively. We will use this fact in Appendix B.

B (M) ⊗ N), N ⊗ Ind U

(f) Finally, we explain brieﬂy how the induction functors we have used above, based on the formalism
in [A] and compatible with [APW], ﬁt with the algebraic groups formalism in [J, I,3.3]. Actually, the
original deﬁnition [CPS77, §1] of induction Ind G
B(M) in the algebraic groups case, for a ﬁnite-dimensional
rational G-module M, was the set MorphB(G, M) of B-equivariant morphisms from G to M, with an
evident direct union used for a general rational module M. This deﬁnition is formally quite close to the
[A] deﬁnition in the quantum case. Using Sullivan’s theorem [CPS80, Thm. 6.8], that all locally ﬁnite
Dist(G) modules are rational, it is easy to see that this deﬁnition coincides with the deﬁnition of [A]
used above, with Dist(G in the role of U and Dist(G) in the role of U . Finally, to connect the [CPS77]
deﬁnition with that of [J], simply replace the B × Gop action (b, g)x = bxg on G with the isomorphic
action (b, g)x = g−1xb−1, where b ∈ B and x, g ∈ G.

2.7. Some Special Twisted Induced Modules. In this subsection and the next, we will adapt the
“uniform” notation for the quantum and positive characteristic cases introduced in the discussion of
Theorem 2.1 and elaborated in subsection 2.2. We will presume and utilize the deﬁnitions for the
quantum Frobenius morphism as in, e.g., [L3, Thm. 8.10], [L]. We use a similar notation in positive
characteristic, where the Frobenius morphism originated and is well-known.
Remarks 2.12. In the quantum case, the Frobenius morphism is a homomorphism ϕ : U → Dist(G′),
where Dist(G′) is the distribution algebra (over K) of an algebraic group G′ (semisimple, simply con-
nected, and deﬁned and split over K, with the same root datum as U ). If M is a rational G′-module
over K, we may twist it through ϕ and obtain an integral U module ϕM, trivial on u. We will use
the notation M [1] := ϕM, and the same notation for twisting a module through the Frobenius in the
corresponding characteristic p algebraic groups situation (where U = Dist(G) is both the domain and
the target of the Frobenius homomomrphism).

Returning to the quantum case, we remind the reader of our notation p = b · U 0 (and that this
notation is simlar to that in [ABG], except that our b is associated to negative roots). The Frobenius
homomoprhism is compatible with triangular decompositions of its domain and target; see [L3, Thm.
8.10]. So, the above M [1] notation also makes sense, if M is (in the obvious analogous notation) a
rational B′ or T ′-module. This results, respectively, in an integral B or p module M [1], trivial as a b-
module. (There is some ambiguity of notation here: if M is not obviously a G′-module, we deliberately
do not include all of u as part of the domain of deﬁnition of M [1] without explicit mention otherwise.)
Conversely, we claim any integrable module N for B or p, which is trivial for b, has, respectively, this
form, and in a unique way. The corresponding assertion for U − for modules trivial for u− follows from
the (negative root analogs of) [L3, Lem.s 8.8, 8.9]. (Note also from these results that the Kernel ideal
of the Frobenius homomorphism on U − is the left U − ideal generated by the augmentation ideal of u−.
Similarly, the Kernel must be the right ideal generated by this augmentation ideal.) At the level of
U 0 for modules trivial on u0 it follows from the explicit form of the Frobenius homomorphism on U 0
in [op cit, p.110, bottom] and the monomial bases [op cit, Thm. 6.7(c), Thm.8.3(ii)] for U 0 and u0,
respectively. The claim follows.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

17

We remark that the parenthetic note above shows an interesting additional property: If N is any
integrable B module, with unspeciﬁed action of b, the largest b-module quotient of N with trivial
b-module action is naturally a (twisted) B-module, call it M [1]. Consequently, if E is any T ′-module,
T ′ (E)[1]) ∼=
then, using rational induction for algebraic groups, Hom B(N, Ind B′
T ′ (E)) ∼= Hom T ′(M|p′, E) ∼= Hom p(N|p, E[1]). This shows the functor sending E[1]
Hom B′(M, Ind B′
to Ind B′
T ′ (E)[1]) serves, on appropriate categories of twisted integrable modules, as a right adjoint to
restriction on corresponding integrable (but not necessarily twisted) categories. In fact, a right adjoint
Ind B
p on the full integrable categories is constructed in [ABG, §2.7]. (There is a similar construction in
[APW2], but the set-up there ostensibly requires ℓ to be a prime power.) The adjointness properties
observed above in this paragraph imply

T ′ (E)[1]) ∼= Hom B(M [1], Ind B′

Ind B

p (E[1]) ∼= Ind B′

T ′ (E)[1],

for E any rational T ′-module.

A completely adequate version of the isomorphism is noted without proof in [ABG, (2.8.2)], presum-
ably based on [ABG, Lem. 2.6.5], which discusses also details of the Frobenius homomorphism at the B
module level. The main application in both [ABG] and this paper occurs with E[1] a 1-dimensional p
module k(ℓλ) := kp(ℓλ), with λ ∈ Y.

We note further that, once an induction Ind B

p is available (as a right adjoint to restriction from CB to

Cp), an induction functor Ind U

p can be constructed as the commposition Ind U

B ◦ Ind B
p.

We conclude these remarks by noting that all features of the above paragraphs have obvious parallels
that hold in the (characteristic p) algebraic groups case, with G = G′, etc. We continue this dual use of
the notations G′, . . . below.

Adapting [ABG, §4.3] to our negative Borel framework, set

(2.12.1)

Iµ := Ind B′

T ′ (µ) ∼= lim
ν∈Y++

−→

(Vν|B′ ⊗ kB′(µ + ν))

where Vν denotes the “costandard” G′-module Ind G′
B′(−w0ν) = H 0(−w0ν) with highest weight −w0ν.
We take µ to be any weight in X, though we will only use the case µ ∈ Y In the quantum case, G′ is
a semsimple algebraic group in characteristic 0, so Vν is irreducible, though we will not need that to
explain the isomorphism in 2.12.1, which we do now:

In general, the lowest weight of Vν is −ν, appearing with multiplicity 1, and kB′(−ν) is the B′-socle of
Vν. Let ω be in Y++, so that ν + ω is also in Y++, and is “larger” than ν if ω 6= 0. This deﬁnes an evident
directed system of weights. There is a natural homomorphism of G′-modules Vν ⊗ Vω → Vν+ω which
is an isomorphism on highest (and, applying w0, on lowest) weight spaces. In particular, the induced
homomorphism of B′-modules Vν ⊗ kB′(−ω) → Vν+ω is an isomorphism on B′-socles, hence injective.
Tensoring on the right with 1-dimensional modules kB′(ν + ω + µ) gives injections

Vν ⊗ kB′(ν + µ) → Vν+ω ⊗ kB′(ν + ω + µ).

For ﬁxed µ these describe the directed system underlying the direct limit in 2.12.1, and shows it is a
directed system of injections, all with a common socle kB′(µ) and with the weight µ appearing with
multiplicity 1. In particular, the direct limit exists as a rational B′ module I and has the same socle
kB′(µ). Consequently, there is a map I → Ind B′
T ′ (k(µ) = Iµ which is an isomorphism on socles. (The
induced module deﬁnition of Iµ shows its only 1-dimensional submodule is kB′(µ).) Thus, I ⊆ Iµ. To
get equality, it is enough to show that, for any weight τ of Iµ, there is a ν ∈ Y++ such that the τ
weight space of Vν ⊗ kB′(ν + µ) has dimension equal to that of the τ weight space of Iµ. The (weight
µ of Iµ is (after conversion to a left B′-module) generated by its
space by weight space) linear dual I ∗
µ = Dist(U ′−)v may be viewed as the homomorphic
(1-dimensional) −µ weight space, call it kv. Thus, I ∗
image of M(ν)|B′ ⊗kB′(−ν −µ), where M(ν) denotes the Verma module for Dist(G′) with highest weight
ν. The linear dual of the injection Vν ⊗ kB′(ν + µ) → Iµ gives a surjection I ∗
µ → ∆(ν)|B′ ⊗ kB′(−ν − µ),

18

TERRELL L. HODGE, PARAMASAMY KARUPPUCHAMY, AND LEONARD L. SCOTT

where ∆(ν) is the Weyl module of highest weight ν. Thus, we have a composition of surjections

M(ν)|B′ ⊗ kB′(−ν − µ) → I ∗

µ → ∆(ν)|B′ ⊗ kB′(−ν − µ).

We want to show that the −τ weight space dimensions on the left and right (and, thus, also in the
middle) are the same for some choice of ν. This is equivalent to showing that the ν + µ − τ weight
spaces of the Verma and Weyl modules with highest weight ν are the same for some ν, given µ and τ .
This dimension is obviously independent of the base ﬁeld k in the Verma module case, and the same
independence is true in the Weyl module case by [J, II,8.3(3)]. Over the complex numbers, the Kernel
of the map M(ν) → ∆(ν) is generated as a B′-module, by the elements F Ni+1
v+, where v+ is a highest
weight vector, Ni is the coeﬃcient of µ at the ith fundamental weight, and Fi is a Chevalley basis root
vector associated with the negative of the ith fundamental root αi. (All observed in [ABG, §4.3].) It
is easy to choose all ν so that each coeﬃcient of τ − µ at αi is smaller than Ni + 1. In this casee the
Kernel has a zero weight space for weight ν + µ − τ . Thus, the dimensions of the weight spaces for this
weight are the same in both the Verma and Weyl module, as desired. This proves I = Iµ.

Proof. For part a) observe that Ext n
B (Y, kB(ω)) = 0 unless ω is dominated by some weight ν with the
weight space Yν 6= 0. There is no such ν, if the height of ω is suﬃciently large, depending only on the
ﬁnite dimensional module Y. For σ suﬃciently large, all the nonzero weight spaces in J ′
µ /Jσ,µ
occur for weights with a large height, determined by µ and the choice of σ. For such a σ and µ, we have
Ext n
σ,µ) = 0 for all nonnegative integers n. (This can be easily seen with direct limit arguments.)
Part a) follows, and part b) may be obtained by using (modules in a ﬁnite complex representing)

Part (2) also follows (in both the quantum and algebraic group cases), using Lemma 2.14, and (3.4.2)

3. A Proof of the Induction Theorems

After providing an initial framework and brief outline of the steps to be used, this section proceeds
step-by-step to complete the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, the latter treated in its equivalent
formulation, Theorem 2.1. Indeed, at this stage the proofs can be given simultaneously, largely thanks
to results in the previous section, such as Corollary 2.15. In those results, the statements make sense and
are correct in both the quantum and positive characteristic cases, though some attention to diﬀerences–
at least to diﬀerent sources–are sometimes required in their proofs. Such diﬀerentiation is no longer
necessary in the wording of proofs in this section. Once the proof has been completed, subsection 3.5
summarizes some of the similarities and diﬀerences between our approach and that taken in [ABG].

3.1. Sketch of the Proof of the Induction Theorems. The proof of the induction theorems begins,
as is implicit in [ABG], with the idea of utilizing the following ‘general nonsense’ result on categorical
equivalences. The proof is left to the reader.

Lemma 3.1. Let A and B be two triangulated categories, and let F : A → B be a morphism of
triangulated categories, that is, F sends triangles in A to triangles in B, and commutes with the respective
translation functors on A and B. Then F is an equivalence of triangulated categories if there is a set of
objects S in A, such that the following two conditions hold:

(A) the minimal full triangulated subcategory of A containing S is, up to isomorphic objects, the

whole category A, and likewise for B in place of A and F (S) := {F (a) | a ∈ S} in place of S;

(B) for any objects a, a′ ∈ S, the functor F induces isomorphisms

Hom A(a, a′[k]) 7→ Hom B(F (a), F (a′)[k])

for all k ∈ Z.

This lemma will be applied with A = Dtriv(B), B = Dbblock(U ) 10 S = kB(ℓλ), λ ∈ Y. Standard argu-
ments with (distinguished triangles arising from) homological degree truncations (see [BBD, Exemples
1.3.2]) show that S does, indeed, generate A as a triangulated category.

The functor IndU

B has been discussed in Section 2. It is an additive left exact functor, so, from general
is a morphism of triangulated categories.

principles,

9While several references are made in the proof of this theorem to [APW] and [APW2], they are of a general formal
nature, similar to those of [A] we discuss above of 2.3, and do not requiring that ℓ be a prime power. It is, however,
necessary in [GK] to quote a case of Kempf’s theorem, but there [GK] gives a (correct) reference to [AW, Thm. 5.3] .

10Throughout this paper we use quantum and algebraic groups in a “simply connected” setting.

In particular this
means that all of our B-modules, always assumed to be a direct sum of their weight spaces, can have associated weights
which are in X, not just Y, as in the [ABG] “adjoint group” setting. However, the more general B-modules are obviously
the natural direct sum of submodules whose associated weights belong to a ﬁxed coset (one for each summand) of Y in X.
This has the consequence that the two versions of Dtriv(B) in these respective B-module contexts are naturally equivalent.
Similar considerations apply to U-modules and block(U).

Corollary 2.10 shows that RIndU
Lemma 3.1 and its condition (A) are met, with F the restriction of RIndU

B (S) generates Dbblock(U ). Consequently, the starting hypotheses of

B to Dtriv(B).

So, to establish the induction theorems, it suﬃces to prove condition (B) of Lemma 3.1 holds, that

is, RIndU

B gives isomorphisms

Hom Dtriv(B)(kB(ℓλ), kB(ℓµ)[n]) ∼= Hom Dbblock(U )(RIndU

B kB(ℓλ), RIndU

B kB(ℓµ)[n])

for any λ, µ ∈ Y and n ∈ Z. That is, it suﬃces prove for all λ, µ ∈ Y and n ≥ 0 that applying RIndU
produces isomorphisms

B(kB(ℓλ), kB(ℓµ)) ∼= Ext n

block(U )(RIndU

B kB(ℓλ), RIndU

B kB(ℓµ)),

where the right hand side is an ‘Ext ’ computed in the sense of hypercohomology. To establish (3.1.1)
we will proceed as follows, with the ﬁrst step the same as in [ABG]:

STEP 1: Show

(3.1.2)

dim(Ext n

B(kB(ℓλ), kB(ℓµ))) = dim(Ext n

block(U )(RIndU

B kB(ℓλ), RIndU

B kB(ℓµ)))

for any λ, µ ∈ Y and n ≥ 0.

STEP 2 : Employing the equalities (3.1.2), show, for the twisted B−modules I [1]

µ deﬁned in (2.12.2), that

there are isomorphisms

(3.1.3)

Ext n

µ ) ∼= Ext n

block(U )(RIndU

B (kB(ℓλ)), IndU

B (I [1]

µ )),

arising from the functoriality of RIndU

B .

STEP 3 : Making use of the structure of the modules I [1]

η , recover the desired isomorphisms (3.1.1) from

the isomorphisms (3.1.3), and (once again) the dimension equalities (3.1.2).

3.2. Step 1 of the Proof of the Induction Theorems. We largely follow [ABG] for this step, with
the exception of the proof of part (ii) of Lemma 3.2 below, which is [ABG, Lem.4.1.1(ii)] in the quantum
case. We give a proof in the algebraic groups case in Appendices A and B of this paper. However, the
proof [ABG, Lem.4.1.1(ii] given in [ABG] is not nearly adequate, in our view, even in the quantum case,
and we point out in appendices A and B how our proofs there apply to complete it. As mentioned in the
introduction, we are grateful to P. Achar and S. Riche for a suggestion to the eﬀect that we look more
closely at the [ABG] proof of this result. (In a very preliminary version of this paper, we had assumed
the proof in [ABG] was suﬃcient in the quantum case, and even that it applied to the modular case.)
We also thank S. Riche for pointing out an error in our ﬁrst naive attempt at a correction.

The result Lemma 3.2(ii) below is actually quite strong, in either the algebraic groups or quantum
case, and gives, in the regular weight case, a categoriﬁcation of Rickard’s theorem [R94, Thm. 2,1]
on derived equivalences arising from translations. (Essentially, the latter theorem gives Lemma 3.2(i),
when the derived equivalences involved in the statement of the theorem are identiﬁed in its proof. But
the theorem only claims a version of Lemma 3.2(ii) at a character-theoretic level.)

We introduce the lemma by observing, as in the discussion above [ABG, Lem. 4.1.1] that translation
functors may constructed as in the algebraic groups case. This is carried out in [APW, §9], though with
the explicit assumption that ℓ be a prime power. This may be removed by appealing to Theorem 3
above. It is easy to check that the resulting constructions have the familiar adjointness and exactness
properties of the algebraic groups case [J, II, Lem. 7.6]. Continuing the discussion in [ABG], let
Ξα : block(U ) −→ block(U ) denote a composition of translation functors ﬁrst ‘to the wall’ labelled
assoiated to a simple reﬂection sα and, then back ‘out of the wall’. There are canonical adjunction
morphisms f : id −→ Ξα,and g : Ξα −→ id. It is noted in [ABG] that the mapping cone, C(f ), of f
gives rise to a triangulated functor from Dblock(U ) to itself, denoted θ+
α . A similar construction (using
C(g)[−1]) gives a triangulted functor θ−
α . These constructions carry over easily to the algebraic groups
case. The statement below is [ABG, Lem. 4.1.1] in both the quantum and algebraic groups cases.

Lemma 3.2. With the notation discussed above, we have in both the quantum and algebric groups cases:

Remark 3.3. As discussed above, the proof of part (ii) is given in appendices A and B. The proof of
part (i) may be obtained from the argument for [R94, Thm. 2.1], or, alternately, from the argument for
[ABG, Lem. 4.1.1(i)]. (Both arguments involve similar ingredients.) We mention that [ABG] deﬁnes
both θ+ and θ− as mapping cones. The reader should be aware that the natural deﬁnition of θ− is as a
shifted mapping cone, as in the description given here, to obtain property (i).

Lemma 3.4. For any λ, µ ∈ R and n ≥ 0,

quantum case, and the better known algebraic groups case of that corollary is discussed just above it.
To summarize, the identity above holds in both cases, for (at least) any object M in Dtriv(B). This
proves the lemma in the special case λ = 0 and arbitrary µ ∈ Y.

The general case will be reduced to the special case by means of translation functors. For any λ, µ ∈ Y

B kB(ℓλ), RIndU

and ν ∈ Y+, we claim (*)
RHom block(U )(RIndU
Let ν = sα1sα2 · · · sαr ∈ Y ⊂ Waf f be a reduced expression. Then ℓν = 0sα1 sα2 ···sαr and hence ℓλ + ℓν =
(ℓλ)sα1 sα2 ···sαr > (ℓλ)sα1 sα2 ···sαr−1 > · · · > ℓλ. Now the repeated use of the second part of Lemma 3.2
give us RIndU
B kB(ℓλ)). This together with the ﬁrst property
of Lemma 3.2 gives (*).

Notice the right hand terms of the two isomorphisms labeled (**) are the same, so that we can view (**)
as providing isomorphisms of three expressions, all obtained by applying RHom block(U ). Passing, for any
ﬁxed i, to RiHom block(U ) expressions, we obtain three vector spaces of the same dimension. One of these
vectors spaces RiHom block(U )(RIndU
B kB(ℓµ − ℓλ)) is isomorphic to RiHom B(kB(0), kB(ℓµ −
ℓλ)), by the special case above with (ℓµ − ℓλ)) used in the role of ℓµ. Finally, using the isomorphism
RHom B(kB(0), kB(ℓµ − ℓλ)) ∼= RHom B(kB(ℓλ), kB(ℓµ)) we complete the proof of the lemma.

tensoring on the right the ﬁrst (resp., second) component of each term appearing in the equality given by
Lemma 3.4, by any ﬁnite-dimensional twisted G−module M [1] (resp., N [1]) with weights in Y, preserves

B (kB(ℓλ), N [1]|B ⊗ kB(ℓµ)))

= dim(Ext n

block(U )(RIndU

B kB(ℓλ), N [1] ⊗ RIndU

B kB(ℓµ))).

3.3. Step 2 of the Proof of the Induction Theorems.

Lemma 3.5. Let λ be any element of Y (or X). Choose ν = Nρ, with ρ as in section 2.4.2, and with
N ∈ N large enough so that ℓτ := ℓ(ν + λ) is dominant. Let Vν be as in (2.12.1). Then the B-module
M = V [1]

ν ⊗ kB (ℓτ ) satisﬁes the following three properties:

(1) kB (ℓλ) ⊂ M.
(2) All composition factors of M/kB (ℓλ) have the form kB (ℓη)) with η > λ in the dominance order.
(3) The map RIndU

B (M) → M is p-split.

Proof. Once again, the argument uses ideas from [ABG], especially in the analysis of the map in part
(3).

Note M ∼= M [1]

0 , where M0 is the B′−module Vν ⊗ kB′(τ ). The B′−socle of Vν is kB′(−ν), so kB′(λ) ∼=
kB′(−ν) ⊗ kB′(τ ) is the B′−socle of M0. Parts 1) and 2) of the lemma for M follow immediately from
corresponding properties of M0.

0 . The natural B−map ϕ0 : F0 → M0 is

Next, put F0 = IndU

B (M0) ∼= Vν ⊗ IndU

B (kB(τ )) and F = F [1]

surjective, as follows from the surjectivity of IndU

B (kB(τ ) → kB(τ ).

Consequently, the Frobenius twisted map ϕ : F → M is surjective.

It is also p−split, since both
domain and range are completely reducible as p−modules. The map ϕ gives rise (by adjointness) to a
map F → RIndU
B (M) → M, is the p−split
surjection ϕ. Consequently, RIndU
B (M) → M is also p−split. This proves Property (3) and completes
the proof of Lemma 3.5.
Q.E.D.

B (M) which, when composed with the natural map RIndU

Our arguments now begin to diverge from [ABG].

Lemma 3.6. Suppose µ ∈ Y and Y is a ﬁnite-dimensional B-module all of whose composition factors
are of the form factors kB (ℓλ) with λ ∈ Y). Then for all nonnegative integers n, and any µ,

(3.6.1)

Ext n

B(Y, I [1]

µ ) ∼= Ext n

U (RIndU

B (Y ), RIndU

B (I [1]

µ )).

Proof. First, observe that (3.6.1) is true for n odd, with both sides zero, by Corollary 2.15(1). This
greatly simpliﬁes long exact sequence arguments in the remaining n even cases. Now ﬁx n even. Then
(3.6.1) is equivalent to the case where Y is one-dimensional. (In fact, for any given Y , (3.6.1) is implied
by the corresponding results for each of its composition factors.)

Next, observe in the one-dimensional case, that it is suﬃcient to check injectivity of the left-to-right
map implicit in (3.6.1). This is a consequence of Corollary 2.15(1) and the dimensional equalities (3.4.2).
In fact, (3.6.1) will be an isomorphism for any one-dimensional Y and µ for which it is an injection or
for any Y and µ (satisfying the hypotheses of the lemma) for which (3.6.1) is an injection on each
composition factor of Y .

We are now in a position to treat the one-dimensional case Y = kB(ℓλ), for our ﬁxed even n, by
downward induction on the height of λ. Note that (3.6.1) is true (with both sides zero) for λ suﬃciently
large, by Corollary 2.15(2). We may, hence, assume inductively that (3.6.1) holds for Y = kB(ℓη) with η
of larger height than λ, or, more generally for all ﬁnite-dimensional Y with composition factors satisfying
this height condition.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

23

Let M be the B-module guaranteed by Lemma 3.5. Let N be the cokernel of the B-module inclusion
kB (ℓλ) ֒→ M. By our height induction, there is an isomorphism (3.6.1) for Y = N and our ﬁxed even n.

Also, the p-split map RIndU

B (M) → M from Lemma (3.5) gives an injection

Ext n

p(M, kp(ℓµ)) ֒→ Ext n

to be an injection. As discussed above, this implies γ is an isomorphism, and completes the induction
for our ﬁxed n. Since n was an arbitrary even nonnegative integer, and since the odd case has already
been handled, the proof of the lemma is complete.
Q.E.D.

To be clear: As a consequence of Lemma 3.6, we immediately obtain the isomorphisms (3.1.3). using

Y = kB(ℓλ). This completes Step 2.

3.4. Step 3 of the Proof of the Induction Theorems. Recall that by Lemma 3.1, it suﬃces to
establish that there are isomorphisms (3.1.1):

B(kB(ℓλ), kB(ℓµ)) ∼= Ext n

block(U )(RIndU

B kB(ℓλ), RIndU

arising from the application of RIndU

It suﬃces to ﬁx throughout an otherwise arbitrary weight λ ∈ Y. For a given µ ∈ Y, all nonnegative

integers n will be treated simultaneously. As a notational convenience, all Ext m
index m are equal to zero by deﬁnition.

and wish to pass to analogous isomorphisms with kB(ℓµ) in place of the terms I [1]

Starting from §3.3, we have isomorphisms (3.1.3) (arising, as noted, from the functoriality of RIndU

B ),
µ appearing in (3.1.3).
To begin, note that “twisting” the canonical B-module injection µ ֒→ Iµ of kB(µ) into its injective

hull Iµ leads to a s.e.s.

RIndU

(3.6.11)

Recall that the key step in producing the isomorphisms (3.6.7) was the earlier vanishing result (3.6.6),

(3.6.13)

Ext n

By applying this vanishing result of (3.6.13) to composition factors of N, (3.6.11), and hence (3.6.12),
do indeed follow as claimed.

We now carry out a descending induction on ht(µ). Assume for all weights η for which ht(η) > ht(µ),

Although a natural approach, [ABG] were unable to use S := {kB (ℓλ) | λ ∈ R} directly as as set of
generators for the triangle category equivalence tool given by Theorem 3.1. This roadblock apparently
motivated their attempt to use the set S′ := {I [1]
λ | λ ∈ R} in place of S. (See [ABG, Remark 4.2.7].)
However, the corresponding claim in [ABG, Lem. 4.3.6] that S′ (equivalently the set {IndB
p (ℓλ) | λ ∈ R})
is inaccurate, since these modules do not actually lie in Dtriv(B). Nevertheless, in the characteristic 0
setting of [ABG], it is true that Dtriv(B) is contained in the triangulated category generated by S′, so
that a line of argument establishing isomorphisms

λ , I [1]

µ ) ∼= Ext n

B (I [1]

λ ), RIndU

B (I [1]

µ )),

as pursued in [ABG, Lem. 4.3.6] would imply the existence of isomorphisms (3.1.1). Unfortunately,
there is no such inclusion of Dtriv(B) in characteristic p > 0. In particular, the ﬁrst line of the proof of
[ABG][Lem. 4.3.6], asserting that the universal enveloping algebra U n (for n a nilpotent Lie algebra in a
triangular decomposition) has ﬁnite global dimension is not true for the correctly analogous characteristic
p situation. It is a question of what modules are to be pulled back under the Frobenius morphism. In
the characteristic p situation, it is necessary to use modules for the distribution algebra of a positive
characteristic unipotent algebraic group, not its unrestricted enveloping algebra, and the ﬁnite global
dimension property is lost. Overcoming this obstacle, while using much of the apparatus of [ABG], is
not trivial, and our proof eventually involves parity properties for b-cohomology [AJ, Prop. 2.3]. See
above Corollary 2.15 and the proof of Lemma 3.6, which also present our argument in the quantum case.

4. Appendix A

The discussion below, in the algebraic groups case, is based on Jantzen’s book ([J], pp. 258-259).
We follow the notations there. Comments on the quantum case are given in Remark 4.3, to which the
reader might look ahead, now. In this appendix and the next we will provide a proof of Lemma 3.2(ii).
A closely linked goal is to understand the adjunction map id ◦ RIndG
B in the spirit
of the long exact sequences on [J, p. 259]. Put L = L(ν1) as on the cited page. The functor T µ
λ , T λ
µ
are constructed from tensor product functors L ⊗ (−), L∗ ⊗ (−), respectively, using block projections
prλ, prµ:

λ ◦ RIndG

B −→ T λ

µ ◦ T µ

µ = prλ(L∗ ⊗ −) ◦ prµ, T µ
T λ

λ = prµ(L ⊗ −) ◦ prλ.

These are the deﬁnitions given in Jantzen, familiar to many readers. All functors are regarded as functors
from the category of rational G-modules to itself. The functor L ⊗ − := L ⊗ (−) is (left and right)
adjoint to L∗ ⊗ − := L∗ ⊗ (−), while prλ and prµ are both self-adjoint (left and right). Consequently,
T µ
λ is (left and right) adjoint to T λ
µ .

Construction of the adjunction map
So far, this is all standard, but we can go a little further.
(1) Let X, Y ∈ G − Mod, the category of rational G-modules. Then the identiﬁcations Hom G(prλX, Y ) ∼=

Hom G(X, prλY ) are quite canonical: Write X, Y , respectively, as direct sums of submodules

X = prλX ⊕ pr′

λX, Y = prλY ⊕ pr′

λY,

where pr′
λX has no composition factors in the block associated with λ and is maximal, as a submodule of
X, with that property. The submodule pr′
λY of Y is deﬁned similarly. Obviously, any G-homomorphism
prλX → Y has image in prλY . Consequently, it identiﬁes with a map prλX → prλY . Also, any G-
homomorphism X → prλY sends pr′

λ to 0 and sends prλX to prλY . Thus,

Hom G(prλX, Y ) ∼= Hom G(prλX, prλY ) ∼= Hom G(X, prλY )

with each identiﬁcation very obvious and canonical. We also record

Hom G(X, Y ) ∼= Hom G(prλX, prλY ) ⊕ Hom G(pr′

λX, pr′

λY

All the the observations in the above paragraph hold if λ is replaced by µ.

(2) In particular, suppose we are given a natural transformation η = {ηX,Y }X,Y ∈G−M od from Hom G(L⊗

Y to Hom G(X, L∗ ⊗ Y ). Then η gives maps

ηprλX,prµY : Hom G(L ⊗ prλX, prµY ) −→ Hom G(prλX, L∗ ⊗ prµY ).

This induces, using (1), a natural transformation we will call ˜η, again deﬁned on G − Mod × G − Mod,
with ˜ηX,Y a map from Hom G(prλL ⊗ prλX, prµY ) to Hom G(X, prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµY )). Explicitly,

Hom G(L ⊗ prλX, prµY )

with the vertical isomorphisms between the top two rows given by (1). Note there is a similar diagram
with prµY replacing Y in the bottom two rows (using ˜ηX,prµY ).

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

27

(3) Using the naturality of η, we can put another row and commutative diagram(s) on top of the top

row above:

Hom G(L ⊗ prλX, Y )

ηprλX,Y

Hom G(prλX, L∗ ⊗ Y )

Hom G(L ⊗ prλX, prµY )

ηprλX,prµY

Hom G(prλX, L∗ ⊗ prµY )

Here the pair of vertical maps pointing upward are indexed by the inclusion prµ → Y and yield a
commutative diagram. Similarly the pair of downward arrows are indexed by the projection Y → prµY
and give a commutative diagram. The composite of the homomorphisms represented by the upward
pointing arrows with the homomomorphism represented by the corresponding downward pointing arrows
are identities.

We can now prove

Proposition 4.1. Assume the natural transformation η = {ηX,Y }X,Y ∈G−M od gives natural isomorphisms

ηX,Y : Hom G(L ⊗ X, Y ) −→ Hom G(X, L∗ ⊗ Y ),

and let ˜η = {˜ηX,Y }X,Y ∈G−M od be the corresponding natural transformation constructed above. Then ˜η
gives natural isomorphisms

˜ηX,Y : Hom G(T µ

λ X, Y ) −→ Hom G(X, T λ

µ Y ).

Moreover, the corresponding adjunction transformation fadj from the identity functor on G − Mod to
the functor T λ
λ may be constructed from the adjunction map adj similarly associated with η. In fact,
for each X ∈ G − Mod, we have a commutative diagram

µ T µ

where the down arrow on the right is the composite projection

µ T µ

λ X.

Proof. We use the (noted) alternate version of the diagram in (2) in which prY replaces Y , and use the
diagram in (3) as given. The combination gives a commutative diagram

Hom G(L ⊗ prλX, Y )

−−−−−−−→ Hom G(prλX, L∗ ⊗ Y )

In this diagram, the middle rectangle is identical to the diagram just discussed. All the unlabeled
vertical maps are evident projections. In particular, the whole commutative diagram could be extended
on the left, preserving commuttitivity, by a long downward equality map from the upper left X to the
lower left X. Also, the lower right equality arrow can be reversed, still preserving commutativity. With
these changes, the perimeter rectangle becomes the commutative diagram required in the proposition.
This completes its proof.
Q.E.D.

We remark that the adjunction obtained from the usual natural isomorphism

Hom G(L ⊗ X, Y ) ∼= Hom G(X, L∗ ⊗ X)

is quite explicit: For x ∈ X, adjX (x) = 1L ⊗ x, if L∗ ⊗ L is identiﬁed with Hom k(L, L). Even if we do
not use that identiﬁcation, we can just write

adjX (x) = X

ǫ∗ ⊗ ǫ ⊗ x,

11It is a general property of adjunction maps Id → EF where E is a right adjoint to a functor F , that any map

φ : X → X ′ in the underlying category gives a commutative diagram

ǫ∈I

φ

X

/ EF (X ′)

EF (φ),

/ EF (X)

where both horizontal maps are adjunctions. We include a brief proof: F (φ) is the value at 1F (X) of the evident map
Hom (F (X), F (X)) → Hom (F (X), F (X ′)) and also the value at 1F (X ′) of the evident map Hom (F (X ′), F (X ′)) →
Hom (F (X), F (X ′)). Applying the (natural) adjointness isomorphism Hom (F (−), F (−)) ∼= Hom (−, EF (−)) to F (φ)
yields a map X → EF (X ′) which, correspondingly, factors in two diﬀerent ways, giving the desired commutative diagram.
We remark that there is a dual commutative diagram for the “counital adjunction” F E → Id The formulation and

proof may be given using dual categories and the adjunction case.

where ǫ ranges over any basis I of L, and ǫ∗ denotes the corresponding dual basis element. The sum on
the right is independent of the basis I chosen.

As a corollary to the proposition, we have

Corollary 4.2. Let X, Y ∈ G − mod, and identify L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ (X ⊗ Y ) ∼= (L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ X) ⊗ Y . Then
adjX⊗Y (−) = (adjX (−)) ⊗ Y . If all weights of Y lie in the root lattice, then fadjX⊗Y [1](−) = fadjX(−) ⊗
Y [1], identifying T λ

λ (X ⊗ Y [1]) with (T λ

λ X) ⊗ Y [1].

µ T µ

µ T µ

Proof. The ﬁrst equality is immediate from the formula for adjX (x), x ∈ X above, applied to to X ⊗ Y
and adjX⊗Y .

We can argue with adj to handle fadj: First, observe the rearrangements

prλ(X ⊗ Y [1]) = prλX ⊗ Y [1], and

prµ(L ⊗ prλ(X ⊗ Y [1])) = prµ(L ⊗ prλX ⊗ Y [1]) = prµ(L ⊗ prλX) ⊗ Y [1]. Also,

prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλ(X ⊗ Y [1]))) = prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλX))) ⊗ Y [1].

Here we have heavily used the fact that the operator − ⊗ Y [1] commutes with our “block” projections.
(Recall the latter are formulated in terms of the aﬃne Weyl group, which contains translations by
p-multiples of the root lattice.) We have regarded prλX as a submodule of X, and have taken a
similar viewpoint with all the projections in these equalities. (Similar equalities hold for complementary
projections, Thus, pr′
Recall that we have described fadjX in Proposition 4.1 as the composition of adjX followed by a

λ(X ⊗ Y [1]) = pr′

λX ⊗ Y [1], etc.)

sequence of projections

L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ X → L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ prλX → L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλX) → prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλX).

Tensoring adjX (−) on the right with Y [1] gives fadjX⊗Y [1](−) as shown above (even with Y [1] any G-
module). Next, tensor the sequence of projections displayed above with Y [1], obtaining

L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ X ⊗ Y [1] → L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ prλ(X ⊗ Y [1]) → L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλ(X ⊗ Y [1])

Using the rearrangements discussed above, we get

→ prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλX)) ⊗ Y [1].

L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ X ⊗ Y [1] → L∗ ⊗ L ⊗ prλX ⊗ Y [1] → L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλX) ⊗ Y [1]

→ prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµ(L ⊗ prλ(X ⊗ Y [1]))).

Here we have identiﬁed tensor products isomorphic through the associative law. The lower display above

is easily recognized as the sequence in Proposition 4.1 whose composition with adjX⊗Y [1] gives fadjX⊗Y [1].
Combining this with the equality adjX⊗Y [1](−) = adjX (−) ⊗ Y [1] noted above gives the identiﬁcation
fadjX⊗Y [1](−) = fadjX (−) ⊗ Y [1], completing the proof of the corollary.
Q.E.D.

Remark 4.3. The quantum case

The lack of cocommutativity requires some care in treating the quantum case, and it becomes important
to distinguish right from left. For example, consider the “usual” natural isomorphism

Hom G(L ⊗ X, Y ) ∼= Hom G(X, L∗ ⊗ X)

in the algebraic groups case. It may be given in more detail as a composite

(4.3.1)

Hom G(L ⊗ X, Y ) ∼= Hom G(X, Hom k(L, Y )) ∼= Hom G(X, L∗ ⊗ Y ).

The right hand isomorphism depends on the isomorphism of G-modules

Hom k(L, Y ) ∼= L∗ ⊗ Y.

30

TERRELL L. HODGE, PARAMASAMY KARUPPUCHAMY, AND LEONARD L. SCOTT

The usual way to identify a simple tensor element f (−) ⊗ y on the right (f ∈ L∗, y ∈ Y ) with a function
on the left is to let it send v ∈ L to f (v)y. Let g ∈ G, and suppose for a moment that G is not a group,
but a Hopf algebra with antipode S, and that L, Y are left G-modules. Using Sweedler (implicit sum)
notation, with g mapping to g1 ⊗ g2 under comultiplication, the action of g on the right hand element
gives f (Sg1(−) ⊗ g2y, but, on the left, it gives a function sending v to f (Sg2(v))g1y. The latter is not
formally the function corresponding to the right hand element without cocommutativity.

This can be ﬁxed by either using the right action of the Hopf algebra G or by keeping the left action
and changing the tensor product L∗ ⊗ Y to Y ⊗ L∗. We prefer the latter approach, since left actions are
often implicitly used–e.g., in [J]. In keeping with the spirit of previous sections of this paper, deﬁne an
“opposite” tensor product ⊗op by

X ⊗op Y := Y ⊗ X,

A similar analysis can be carried out on the left hand isomorphism of the display (4.3.1). We ﬁnd

that the standard correspondence gives an isomorphism of left G-modules
Hom k(L ⊗op X, Y ) ∼= Hom k(X, Hom k(L, Y )).

Here the left action of the Hopf algebra G on the various modules Hom k(−, −) is given by “conjugation.”
That is, if g ∈ G and f is a linear function from one left G-module to another, the action of g on f
gives a linear function g1f (Sg2(−)). When the antipode is surjective (as it is for all the Hopf algebras
we consider), the space of “ﬁxed points” of this action of G (all f for which each g ∈ G acts through
the counit) results precisely in the space of G-homomorphisms. (A general statement and proof of this
fact may be found in [APW, 2.9].) In particular, we have a general version of (4.3.1) which holds for
any such Hopf algebra:

(4.3.2)

Hom G(L ⊗op X, Y ) ∼= Hom G(X, Hom k(L, Y )) ∼= Hom G(X, L∗ ⊗op Y ).

Finally, notice that ⊗op is just as associative an operation as ⊗, which is strictly associative, if standard
identiﬁcations are made in iterated tensor products of k-spaces.

Thus, the results and arguments of this section hold in the quantum case. The reader can
even read or reread the statements and arguments in both the algebraic groups case and quantum case
simultaneously, after replacing ⊗ with ⊗op, and using the same simultaneous notations U , B, k, . . . , as
in previous sections, in place of G, B, k, . . ..

We now return to Jantzen [J], pp. 258-259. Proposition 7.11 there implies, if T µ

λ is “to a wall,” then

5. Appendix B

Recall Jantzen denotes one dimensional weight modules by the weights alone.

T µ
λ RIndG

B (w · λ) ∼= RIndG

B (w · µ).

The argument for the above isomorphism is helpful: T µ

B (w · λ) =
prµ(L ⊗ RIndG
B (L ⊗ w · λ). At this point a B composition series of L is examined
and it is found that there is only one composition factor, call it λl appearing with multiplicity one, such
that prµRIndG

B (λl ⊗ w · λ) 6= 0. It is determined that λl ⊗ w · λ is w · µ, completing the proof.

B (w · λ) = prµ(L ⊗ prλRIndG

B (w · λ)) = prµRIndG

λ RIndG

Next, let us come “out of the wall” with T λ

µ . We assume µ is on a true “wall” with stabilizer {1, s}

for a simple reﬂection s. We want to know what happens to T λ

µ RIndG

B (w · µ). Again, write

µ RIndG
T λ

B (w · µ) = prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµRIndG

B (w · µ))

= prλ(L∗ ⊗ RIndG
= prλRIndG

B (w · µ)
B (L∗ ⊗ w · µ).

This time L∗ has two composition factors exactly, γ = ν and γ = ν′, each appearing with multiplicity
1, such that prλRIndG
B (γ ⊗ w · µ) ≤ 0. The two weights ν, ν′(not Jantzen’s notation) satisfy {ν + w ·
µ, ν′ + w · µ} = {w · λ, ws · λ}.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

31

Jantzen treats the case ws · λ < w · λ (with the roles of λ, µ reversed) in [J, Prop. 7.12]. For our
purposes, to be compatible with Lemma 3.2(ii), we will consider the case ws · λ > w · λ, which requires
diﬀerent arguments (in the same setting).

5.1. The main issue. In this case there is an exact sequence of B-modules

0 −→ M −→ L∗ ⊗ sw · µ −→ M ′ −→ 0

in which the weight w · λ appears in M and ws · λ appears in M ′. These appearances are each with
B (τ ) 6= 0 appears in either M or M ′. Apply prλRIndG
multiplicity 1, and no other weight τ with prλRIndG
to the above short exact sequence.

B

The result is a distinguished triangle

· · · −→ RIndG

B (w · λ) −→ T λ

B (w · µ) −→ RIndG

B (ws · λ) −→ · · ·

As previously noted, the middle term is isomorphic to

λ RIndG

B (w · λ).

This leads to the question as to whether or not the resulting map

RIndG

λ RInd(w · λ)

is the adjunction map. We claim that it is, indeed, the adjunction map, at least up to a nonzero scalar
multiple. (Thus, there is a distinguished triangle (*) in which the left hand map is adjunction.)

The proof of this claim will essentially occupy the rest of this appendix! We will use the
context and notation of the algebraic groups case, and treat the quantum case at the end in Remark
5.15. Part (ii) of Lemma 3.2 then follows, since θ+

For the moment, we prove the claim in the case where both w · λ and ws · λ are dominant: Note that

so that any map from RInd(w · λ) to the middle term of (*) factors through the left hand map. However,
B (w · λ), w · λ) ∼= k. The claim follows. In our argument we have used the fat that RIndG
Hom B(RIndG
is right adjoint to restriction.

5.2. We will now try to exploit the validity of the dominant case, by using it to build well-behaved
resolutions in the general w · λ < ws · λ case, to which we now return.

The B-modules we will use to resolve w · λ will be sums of those of the form w · λ ⊗ pτ ⊗ V[1], where
τ is in the root lattice and V[1] is a Frobenius twisted G-module (restricted to B) with V having all
weights in the root lattice.

sum of B-modules pτ ⊗ V[1], with τ and V[1] as above. Moreover, we may assume all τ are dominant
and that q · λ + pτ, w · µ + pτ , are ws · λ + pτ are also dominant.

∼

In fact, we can assume ν + pτ is dominant for all ν in any ﬁxed ﬁnite list of weights.

Proof. Notice that k and all pτ ⊗ V[1] are Frobenius-twisted B-modules. Each (Frobenius-)twisted
injective B-module hull I [1]
µ for a weight µ in the root lattice is a direct union of modules p(µ + σ) ⊗ V[1];
see(e:Itwist). Thus, any ﬁnite dimensional B-module N [1], with N having all weights in the root lattice,
can be embedded in a direct sum of these, with the weights τ = µ + σ, as large as we like. The cokernel
of the embedding will also be a ﬁnite dimensional twisted B-module of the same form as N [1] above.
Hence the process can continue. Starting with k = k(0) in the initial role of N [1], we obtained the
Q.E.D.
desired resolution.

We now describe some of the main issues we face at this point. Let τ be any weight in the root lattice
such that w · λ + pτ, w · µ + pτ , and ws · λ + pτ are dominant, as well as pτ. Form the composite of the
adjunction map

IndG

B (w · λ + pτ ) −→ T λ

B (w · µ + pτ )

and the usual isomorphism

Tλ

µ Tµ

λ IndG

B (w · λ + pτ ) ˜→Tλ

µ IndG

B (w · µ + pτ )

Note w · λ + pτ = w′ · λ and w · µ + pτ = w′ · µ for w′, the composite of w followed by translation by pτ .
We will discuss the “usual” isomorphism later in some details, but it is exact nature may be regarded
as unknown at the moment, together with any details regarding the adjunction map. We do, however,
note that the latter map is nonzero. The composite then gives a nonzero map

(5.3.1)

IndG

B (w · λ + pτ ) −→ Tµ

λ IndG

B (w · µ + pτ )

“Another” map with the same domain and target objects is obtained, as in 5.1, by applying prλIndG

B (−)
to the sequence 0 −→ M −→ L∗ ⊗ w · µ there, but with w′ · µ = w · µ + pτ playing the role of w · µ.
We will call the resulting map the “Jantzen map” Janw·λ
for Y the B-module pτ = k(pτ ). ( We will
shortly generalize this notation.) To discuss Janw·λ
and (5.3.1) in a parallel way, denote the latter as
Adjw·λ

(for the same Y ). Then the discussion at the end of 5.1 gives, using w′ in place of w there:

Now let Y w·λ denote the full subcategory of B-modules pτ ⊗ V[1] with pτ as in the proposition and

agree, and the “obvious” isomorphism on the right in the outer rectangle deﬁne, through composition, an

The isomorphism Isow·λ

is obtained in a similar spirit to our construction above of the isomorphism
prλRIndG
B to L ⊗ −. The module L has only
one weight, which we called λℓ at the beginning of this appendix (in the discussion of the “to a wall”
isomorphism), with the property that λℓ + w · λ belongs to Waf f · µ. The same is true if any weight of
Y is added to w · λ. We have w · µ = λℓ + w · λ, and so w · µ ⊗ Y ∼= λℓ ⊗ w · λ ⊗ Y. The weight λℓ appears
with multiplicity one in L, so

B (w · λ ⊗ Y ), except we apply prµRIndG

B (L ⊗ w · λ ⊗ Y ) ∼= RIndG

B (λℓ ⊗ w · λ ⊗ Y ) ∼= RIndG

The ﬁrst isomorphism can be constructed by using any B-ﬂag of L with λℓ as a section and applying
prµRIndG
B to the various sub and factor modules associated to the ﬂag terms. If we ﬁx the ﬂag and
procedure, the ﬁrst isomorphism becomes natural in Y ∈ Y. The other isomorphisms obviously are
natural in Y , as are the isomorphisms

12It is is carried out by using a B-module ﬂag of M ⊗ pτ and applying naturality to the various inclusion and factor

maps involved.

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

35

This latter isomorphism arises from the vanishing of (RnIndG

B )(L ⊗ w · λ ⊗ Y ) = 0 for n > 0 ( a

consequence of our construction of Y and the generalized tensor identity).

The composition of all these isomorphisms (in an evident order) is deﬁned to be

Proof. Part (i) already has been proved. Next, note that a commutative lower diagram in (ii) can be
obtained by ﬁrst applying Tλ
µ to a commutative upper diagram, then using the natural isomorphism
µ (− ⊗ V[1]) ∼= Tλ
µ (− ⊗ V[1] on the lower row of the upper diagram. the reader may convince him/her
Tλ
self that the entire procedure preserves the “obvious” property of the vertical maps!

λ Ind (w · λ ⊗ pτ ⊗ V[1]) ∼= Tµ

Thus, it is suﬃce to treat the upper diagram in (ii). The ﬁrst thing to do here is to note the
“obvious”isomorphism Tµ
λ Ind (w · λ ⊗ pτ ) ⊗
V[1]. This gives the ﬁrst column in the upper diagram. The isomorphism may be regarded as the (by
now “obvious”) process of “pulling out” V[1]”, from inductions of tensor products, block projection or
translation functors, or some combination of these operators. The row of isomorphism above requires
two steps to fully “pullout” V[1]. If we continue with the several steps required to deﬁne Isow·λ
Y , we see
at every step along the way there is an opportunity to “pull out” V[1]. This gives a series of possibly
commutative diagrams, written below in top to bottom order.

applied to the “block”’ associated to Waf f · λ (the top row isomorphism has already been given in
Tµ

To get commutativity of the rectangle itself note that all four of its corners are induced modules, by
the tensor identity, isomorphism to the lower left hand corner. Using the formalism in [J, I.3.4], every in-
duced module IndG
B M (where M here just denotes some B−module) is equipped with a B−module map
ǫM : IndG
B M) ⊗ N
composed with ǫM ⊗N gives ǫM ⊗N . (This can be extracted from the discussion in [J, I.3.6].) This implies
that the usual universal property of induction (see [J, I. Prop. 3.46]) applies directly to (IndG

the associated evaluation target. Returning to the rectangle above, all four of its corners, all obtained
from the induced module in the lower left corner by various applications of the tensor identity, have the
same target (up to associativity isomorphisms). Consequently, all maps in the rectangle may be viewed
as “induced” from the identity map on their (common) target. (This certainly true in the case of an
individual application of the tensor identity, from which it to follows in the case of the tensor identity

true in the case of an individual application of the tensor identity, from which it follows in the case of the
tensor identity applied within a tensor product of several factors. All individual maps in the rectangle
arise this way, and the property of being “induced” from the identity map on a common target car-
ries over to composition.) It follows now that the rectangle above is (thoroughly) commutative, as in (2).

Commutativity of (3) is easily seen to hold, since the derived functor RIndG

B on both sides is applied to
objects acyclic for IndG
B (i.e., their “ higher derived functors vanish”). The meaning of the vertical maps
in (4) was discussed in the construction of Isow·λ
Y . The horizontal maps in the bottom row as obtained
from the generalized tensor identity. The top row map is obtained similarly, after pulling V [1] out of
the block projection. Both column constructions may be viewed, before applying prµ, as arising from
maps L −→ L′ ←− λℓ where L′ is a quotient of L, tensoring with w · λ ⊗ pτ or w · λ ⊗ p and applying
B (−) ⊗ V[1]. Since the generalized tensor identity may be regarded as a natural
RIndG
transformation of functors. We obtain a commutative diagram rising from maps L −→ L′ ←− λℓ where

L′ is a quotient of L, tensoring with w · λ ⊗ pτ or w · λ ⊗ p and applying RIndG

Now apply prµ and pullout V[1] on the right. All column isomorphism become the column isomorphisms
in (4), equating the objects in the bottom row of the latter with the same objects with prµ applied.
The top row of (4) has been discussed and agrees with the top row of the diagram above, after the
modiﬁcation.

The commutativity of diagram (5) is easy, since λℓ is equal to w · µ as a weight. It is interesting to
Y must ﬁx an isomorphism between the 1-dimensional section λℓ of

L, and the abstract 1-dimensional weight space w · µ.

Observation:

can be modiﬁed by a nonzero scalar multiplication, and remain
a version obtained by the “same” construction (still a natural transformation deﬁned on the category
Y). Such a modiﬁcation carries over to T Isow·λ

Note that the bottom row in (6) is precisely the right hand column in the upper diagram in (ii). The

Proposition 5.7 (ii), taking X = Ind G

Proposition 5.7(ii) agrees with the bottom edge of the lemma, so concatenation makes sense. Moreover
the right hand column of the concatenated diagram agrees with the left hand column of the lower diagram

We are just about ready for a vast improvement to Proposition 5.4. First we need an easy but key

observation.

Lemma 5.10. For any Y = pτ ⊗ V[1] in Y, the left column “obvious” isomorphisms in the diagrams of
Proposition 5.5(ii) and Proposition 5.8(ii) are equal as are the right column.

Proof. On the left, both isomorphism s just pull out V[1] using the tensor identity. A similar isomorphism
µ (−) and (−)⊗V[1]. Q.E.D.
is used on the right (in both cases) except it is also necessary to commute Tλ

We can now prove a main theorem.

Theorem 5.11. There is a nonzero scalar c ∈ k such that Adjw·λ

Y = cJanw·λ

Y

for all y ∈ Y.

Proof. Proposition 5.4 gives a nonzero scalar that works in the especial case Y = pτ . The constant it
gives is possibly dependent on Y and call it c(pτ ).

Propositions 5.5(ii) and 5.8(iii), together with Lemma 5.10, show we claim, an equality

Y = c(pτ )Janw·λ

whenever Y = pτ ⊗ V[1] ∈ Y. To prove this equality, note Adjw·λ = c(pτ )Janw·λ
with V[1] to get

pτ . Tensor on the right

Adjw·λ

pτ ⊗ V[1] = c(pτ )Janw·λ

pτ ⊗ V[1]

Precompose each side with the downward left column isomorphism common to the diagrams in Propo-
sitions 5.5(ii) and 5.8(ii), and postcompose with the upward right column isomorphism. This gives the
claimed equality (reading it oﬀ from the two commutative diagrams and the previous equality.)

It remains to prove c(pτ ) = c(pτ ′) whenever pτ, pτ ′ are 1-dimensional objects in Y. Note that p(τ +τ ′)
with necessarily, also belong to Y. We will show c(pτ ) = c(p(τ + τ ′)). This is enough, since the equality
c(τ ′) = c(p(τ ′ + τ )) will follow by re-choosing notations.

Let V = IndG

B (τ ′). The pτ ⊗ V[1] and pτ ⊗ pτ ′ = p(τ + τ ′) both belong to Y . There a B− module
map (“evaluation”) from V = IndG
B (τ ′) onto τ ′, and we twist it by the Frobenius to get a surjective map
V[1] −→ pτ ′. Tensor on the left with pτ to get a surjective map pτ ⊗ V[1] −→ p(τ + τ ′). We will call this
map φ. It is a map in the category Y.

We have commutative diagram by naturality of Janw·λ with respect to Y

The left column map is nonzero, since its composition with the evaluation map IndG

B (w · λ ⊗ p(τ +

short exact sequence displayed above Proposition 5.5. Hence the composition

However, there is a similar diagram, identical to the above, but with “Jan” replaced by “Adj”. We

But we have shown that the map appearing to the right of both c(p(τ + τ ′)) and c(pτ ) above is not zero.
So, the only way the equality can occur is to have c(p(τ + τ ′) = c(pτ ).

This completes the proof of the theorem.

Q.E.D.

Though not entirely necessary, it simpliﬁes notation if we modify T Isow·λ

Y by a scalar by changing its
construction, as per the observation in the proof of Proposition 5.6. We do this so that the newly con-
structed T Isow·λ
is the old one multiplied by c above (uniformly in Y ∈ Y). This allows us to have actual
equalities.

domain enlargements can be made for Isow·λ and T Isow·λ. The domain add Y can also be extended to
complexes of objects from add Y, such as the complex K • discussed as Lemma 5.3.

In the next proposition, we use this formalism to illuminate the triangle (*) above the claim in 5.1,

rewritten below

(∗)

· · · −→ RIndG

B (w · λ) −→ Tλ

µ RIndG

B (w · λ) −→ RIndG

B (ws · λ) −→ · · ·

Proposition 5.12. With a suitable choice of the complex K • in Lemma 5.3, there is an exact sequence
of complexes

0 −→ Ind (w · λ ⊗ K •) −→ Tλ

µ IndG

B (w · µ ⊗ K •) −→ IndG

B (ws · λ ⊗ K •) −→ 0

which represent (*) at the level of complexes (in the sense that its sequence of these objects and two maps
- ignoring the 0′s - identiﬁes, after passing to the bounded derived category, with the displayed portion
above of (*)).

The left hand complex map is Janw·λ

K • , the extension of Janw·λ to complexes of add Y objects, in the

particular case of the complex K •.

Proof. Choose K • so that each K n is a direct sum of terms Y = pτ ⊗ V[1] in Y with also ν + pτ dominant
for each weight ν of L∗ ⊗ w · µ. The construction of (*) is from the exact sequence at the top of 5.1

B (− ⊗ K •). Also, prλ applied to IndG

B (−). With our choice of K •, RIndG

B (−) applied to each term is the same as
B (ν ⊗ K •) for ν 6= w · λ in M or ν 6= ws · λ in M ′, is the zero

Thus, prλIndG

B (− ⊗ K •), applied to the displayed sequence, gives an exact sequence

0 −→ IndG

B (w · λ ⊗ K •) −→ prλInd (L∗ ⊗ w · µ ⊗ K •) −→ IndG

B (ws · λ ⊗ K •) −→ 0

The middle term identiﬁes with prλ(L∗ ⊗IndG
must also be made in the construction of (*), though with RIndG
Note also prλ(L∗ ⊗ IndG
similar equality holds for RIndG

B (w · µ ⊗ K •)) = prλ(L∗ ⊗ prµIndG

Following each step above gives the identiﬁcations claimed in the proposition. An alternate argument
could be made by replacing K • in the short exact sequence displayed above with a complex of injective
B−modules ( a resolution of k = k(0) also). This gives a semisplit short exact sequence of complexes.
Its three term sequence then automatically becomes a three term sequence in a distinguished triangle,
upon passing to the derived category. In more detail, let K • −→ I • be an isomorphism of complexes,
with I • a B−module injective resolution of k = k(0). There are resulting commutative diagram of map

The skew maps are isomorphism of complexes, and the vertical maps are all quasi-isomorphisms. The
top row is an exact sequence of complexes of injective objects, is therefore semi-split, and therefore
becomes part of a distinguished triangle (ignoring the zeros and zero maps) at the derived category
label (D+ or Db here). There are a few other commutative squares of quasi isomorphism need to give
a complete picture of the identiﬁcation claimed in the proposition, but we leave then to the reader
(who should have the idea by now). On the left, for example, diagrams must be added handling the
identiﬁcations IndG

the location of w · λ as a section of M.)

The general case of the claim of 5.1

Recall that we noted in 5.1 that the middle term of the distinguished triangle (*) was isomorphic to
µ Tµ
B (w · µ),

B (w · λ). Noting further that this resulted in a map RIndG

we claimed that this map was adjunction, at least up to scalar multiple.

an isomorphism Tµ
both sides gives the isomorphism of complexes

B (w · λ) with the
B (w·µ) of (*) was intended. The top of subsection 5.1 indicates that an isomorphism

B (w · µ ⊗ K •), as in Proposition 5.12 and its proof. Then
B (w · µ ⊗ K •) is s given by Isow·λ

Finally, we need a way to represent the adjunction map from RIndG

This map just applies adjunction to the G−modules in each degree of the complex IndG
B (w · λ ⊗ K •).
This results in a map of complexes, by naturality of adjunction. In particular, passing to the derived
category level (D+ or Db), the map of complexes ˜adjIndG

B (w·λ⊗K • induces “adjunction” as a map

Remark 5.14. Without the adjustment observed in the proof of Proposition 5.6, we only get commu-

Remark 5.15. The quantum case The same changes of ⊗ to ⊗op observed in Appendix A need to be
made in this appendix, in the quantum case. In addition it is necessary to replace the references to [J]
in the proof of Proposition 5.6 with references to Remarks 2.11(d),(e). Remark 2.11(f) helps explain the
diﬀerences in the formalism of these remarks (which also could be used in the algebraic groups case) with
that of [J]. Recall also that Remark 2.11(d) provides both right and left generalized tensor identities in
the quantum case, heavily used in the arguments above (for example, in the proofs of Propositions 5.5
and 5.6. With these changes and observations, all of the proofs and results in this appendix carry over
to the quantum case.

In particular, the claim of subsection 5.1 holds in both the algebraic groups and quantum cases. As

argued below the claim, this completes the proof of Lemma 3.2.

6. Appendix C

The purpose of this appendix is to supplement, and, indeed, to “ﬁx,” the statement and proof of
[ABG, Lem. 9.10.5], as a service to the reader. This is all in characteristic 0, and not part of the
induction theorem (except in the way of application), but it is important to [ABG] as a whole and to
the discussion in [PS2, ftn.13] concerning Koszulity in the quantum case. The proof given in [ABG] of
the lemma, corrected for misprints and issues with the induction theorem proof, still seemed inaccurate
to us, but we found it could be ﬁxed using an algebraic result from [PS2]. The latter result is nontrivial,
but relatively elementary, not using the Lusztig quantum conjecture. This seems desirable, so that
[ABG] could have the latter conjecture, in the ℓ > h case, as a corollary.

Our notation in this appendix largely follows [ABG], with two major changes: The formula for the
“dot” notation • is replaced by that for the standard “dot” action · in [J] and subsection 2.4.2 above.
Thus, the new formula reads, for w in the Weyl group or aﬃne Weyl group, and λ ∈ X,

w • λ = w(λ + ρ) − ρ.

Also, we will use Borel subalgebras B whose associated roots are negative, rather than positive. With
these two changes, [ABG, Lem. 3.5.1], which we will use below, is correct as stated. (It actually was not,
before, even for w = 1.) The statement of the quantum induction theorem [ABG, Thm. 3.5.5], which
we will also use, is unchanged. Finally, the change from positive to negative Borels on the quantum side
is deliberately not repeated on the Langlands dual side, when choosing Borel objects there (associated
to Grassmanian varieties).

At the point the result [ABG, Lem. 9.10.5] in question is introduced in [ABG] the authors have

established an equivalence of derived categories [ABG, (9.10.1)]

γ : Db block(U) → Db Perv (Gr),

≤λ block(U) and Dp

and it is desired to show the functor γ induces an equivalence from block(U) to Perv (Gr). To this
≤λPerv are introduced “for each λ ∈ Y++.” This appears to be a
end, categories Db
misprint, repeated several times on [ABG, p. 668], and the deﬁnition of Db
≤λ block(U) is incorrect with
any choice of λ. Instead, these categories should be introduced for each λ ∈ Y, with µ ≤ λ interpreted
to mean ˜µ ↑ ˜λ, where ˜µ ∈ W • ℓµ is, in our notation here, the (unique) dominant weight, and ˜λ is deﬁned
similarly.

The order ↑ above is that discussed in [J, II,6.1-6.11]; note that p there is allowed to be any positive
integer. The order ↑ should replace the order (cid:22) in [ABG, (3.4.5)]. The followiing equivalence (in the
case ℓ ≥ h)) follows from the more general theorem [PS2, Thm. 9.6], which also has a formulation for
ℓ < h

y • 0 ↑ w • 0 iﬀ y ≤′ w,

whenever y • 0, w • 0 are dominant and y, w ∈ Waﬀ. The order ≤′ is the Bruhat–Chevalley order with
respect to the dominant standard chamber fundamental reﬂections. This equivalence seems essential to
correct the lemma.

We shall use ≤ for the Bruhat–Chevalley order with respect to the antidominant standard chamber.
Thus, for y, w ∈ Waﬀ, y ≤ w iﬀ w0yw0 ≤′ w0ww0, with w0 the long word in W . When y, w are in W ,
y ≤ w means the same as y ≤′ w. When ν, µ ∈ Y, νy ≤ µw iﬀ (−ν)y ≤′ (−µ)w. (The classical root
system has an automorphism y 7→ −w0(y), preserving positive roots.) Notice there is an implicit change
from ≤′ to ≤ in the proof of [ABG, Cor. 8.3.2]. (This occurs in the assertion that “λw−1 is minimal in
aﬀ.” The hypothesis of Cor. 8.3.2(ii) gives minimality of wλ with respect to ≤′.
the right coset λW ≤ W n
Passing to inverses gives minimality of (−λ)w−1 with respect to ≤′. Now it is necessary, it seems, to
use ≤ to get minimality of λw−1.)

REMARKS ON THE ABG INDUCTION THEOREM

45

The deﬁnition of Db

≤λPerv is correct as given in [ABG, p. 668] provided it is allowed that λ ∈ Y.
Similarly, λ should be taken in Y in the statement of the lemma, which we provide below, with this
change. Note the direction of Υ is reverse to the equivalence in part (i).

Lemma 6.1. ([ABG, 9.10.5]) For any λ ∈ Y, we have

(i) the functor Υ induces an equivalence

Db

≤λPerv ∼−→ Db

≤λ block(U).

Moreover,

(ii) the induced functor

Db

≤λPerv /Db

<λPerv −→ Db

≤λ block(U)/Db

<λ block(U)

sends the class of ICλ to the class of Lλ.

Proof. We follow [ABG], taking into account the changes above, and also the misprints noted in [ABG,
p. 675]. There are also some inaccuracies in [ABG, Cor. 8.2.4, Cor. 8.3.2] which we address as they
arise.

We know for any λ ∈ Y, the functor Υ sends, by construction, the object R IndU

B(ℓλ) to W λ. Fix
λ ∈ Y, and let w ∈ W be the element with wλ • 0 = w • ℓλ dominant. Then, by [ABG, Lem. 3.5.1]–see
our Remark 2.11(a) and subsections 2.5, 2.6 for additional details–we have that Rℓ(w)IndU
B(ℓλ) has Lλ
as a composition factor with multiplicity one, and all other composition factors Lµ of Rℓ(w)IndU
B(ℓλ),
or any composition factor Lµ of RjIndU
B(ℓλ) with j 6= ℓ(w), satisfy yµ • 0 ↑ wλ • 0, with y ∈ Waﬀ, yµ • 0
dominant, and yµ • 0 6= wλ • 0. For any such µ, we have yµ <′ wλ, as noted above, and µy−1 < λw−1.
As observed in the proof of [ABG, Cor. 8.3.2], this implies supp W µ = Grµ ⊆ Grλ = supp W λ, and the
inclusion is proper. Thus, Υ takes Db
≤λPerv . By induction (on, say, the height of the
dominant weight w • ℓλ), we may assume Υ induces an equivalence of triangulated categories, when ≤ λ
is replaced by < λ. (Here µ < λ is taken to mean yµ • 0 ↑ wλ • 0 as above, with y ∈ W and yµ • 0 ↑ wλ • 0,
yµ • 0 6= wλ • 0. Equivalently, Grµ is properly contained in Grλ, as we have seen.) By [ABG, §9.1, p. 655]
Perv (Gr) is generated by simple objects ICν, ν ∈ Y, each with support contained in Grν.

≤λ block(U) into Db

We take this opportunity to mention there are errors of sign in [ABG, Cor. 8.2.4, Cor. 8.3.2], where
Cyw[−dim Byw] should be replaced by Cy[dim Byw] and Cλ[−dim Grλ − ℓ(w)] should be replaced by
Cλ[dim Gr − ℓ(w)].13

With these changes, the conclusion of [ABG, Cor. 8.3.2(ii)] shows W λ and ICλ[−ℓ(w)] have the
same restriction to Grλ (from Grλ). This shows, together with the fact that Υ induces an equivalence
Db
<λPerv , which we obtained above by induction, that the strict image under Υ of
Db
≤λPerv . Since we already know Υ provides an equivalence Db block(U) → DbPerv , it
follows now that it induces one between Db

<λ block(U) → Db
≤λ block(U) is Db

≤λPerv . This proves (i).

≤λ block(U) and Db

Moreover, we also get (ii), since we have shown that Υ(R IndU

≤λPerv /Db

tient category Db
of the preimage R IndU
block(U) is Lλ[−ℓ(w)]. This completes the proof of (ii) and the lemma.

B(ℓλ) of W λ show that the image in the quotient category Db

B(ℓλ)) = W λ is ICλ[−ℓ(w)] in the quo-
<λ Perv . Our remarks on the composition factors of the cohomology groups

Parshall, Leonard Scott, and the University of Virginia for their gracious support in so many ways over
the years; in particular, this project was begun while the ﬁrst author was on sabbatical and the second
author was a postdoc at the University of Virginia. Part of the works were completed at Kalamazoo,
thanks to Terrell and WMU for such wonderful arrangements.

13This latter change needs to be made both in the statement and proof of [ABG, Cor. 8.3.2]. The error is in ignoring

the shift in degree that can accompany direct images with proper maps.
