Abstract

Using a set of rephasing invariant variables, it is shown that the renormalization group equations
for quark mixing parameters can be written in a form that is compact, in addition to having simple
properties under ﬂavor permutation. We also found approximate solutions to these equations if
the quark masses are hierarchical or nearly degenerate.

INTRODUCTION

With the recent discovery of the Higgs boson, the last “missing piece” of the standard
model (SM) was ﬁnally found. However, the long-standing mystery, that the Higgs couplings
(mass matrices) appear to be rather arbitrary, remains to be resolved. A commonly held
view posits that the SM is but an eﬀective theory originating from some other theory valid
at high energies, and that more regularity can be found there. To bridge these two energy
regimes, one makes use of the renormalization group equations (RGE). Such RGE for the
mass matrices have been around for a long time (see, e.g., [1–9]). They are relatively simple
when written in terms of the mass matrices themselves. However, these matrices contain a
large number of unphysical degrees of freedom, which must be stripped away to reveal the
values of the physical variables, viz., the masses and the mixing matrices. The procedure is
by no means easy, and it is hard to correlate the variables in the two energy regions. For
this reason a lot of eﬀorts have gone into recasting the RGE into equations containing only
physical variables [6–9]. With these equations the physical variables at diﬀerent energies can
be directly related. Thus, for instance, one may test possible scenarios for mass patterns at
high energies, using the RGE to see if they could evolve into the existing low energy values.
The challenge here comes from the complexity of the RGE, which are lengthy, nonlinear,
partial diﬀerential equations, so that the relations of variables at diﬀerent energy scales are
often obscure, and one can have only a partial view with the use of various approximation
schemes. This diﬃculty, one would hope, can be mitigated to some extent by a judicious
choice of the physical variables.
Indeed, in this paper we propose to cast the one-loop
quark RGE in terms of a set of rephasing invariant variables introduced earlier [10]. It is
found that these RGE can be written in a compact form. In addition, they exhibit manifest
symmetries which, as a consequence of the permutation properties of the chosen variables,
give these equations a very simple structure. As it turns out, this set of equations is still too
complicated to be solved analytically. However, under reasonable assumptions (hierarchy,
degeneracy, etc.), approximate solutions are available. These will be presented in this paper.
As more properties are found about these equations, one may hope that they will help in
the search of a viable high energy theory.

II. REPHASING INVARIANT PARAMETRIZATION

It is well-known that physical observables are independent of rephasing transformations
on the mixing matrices of quantum mechanical states. Thus, instead of individual elements
of the mixing matrix, only rephasing invariant combinations thereof are physical. Whereas
there is nothing wrong to use these elements in intermediate steps of a calculation, at the
end of the day, they must form rephasing invariant combinations in physical quantities. This
situation is similar to that in gauge theory, where one often resorts to a particular gauge
choice for certain problems. The ﬁnal results, however, must be gauge invariant. In this
paper, we propose to use, from the outset, parameters that are rephasing invariant. As
we will demonstrate in Sec. III, in terms of these, the quark RGE become quite simple in
structure, making it easier to analyze the properties of their solutions.

We turn now to Ref.[10], where it was pointed out that six rephasing invariant combina-

tions can be constructed from elements of the CKM matrix, V :

Γijk = V1iV2jV3k = Rijk − iJ,

here (i, j, k) is a cyclic permutation of (1, 2, 3) and detV = +1 is imposed. The common
imaginary part is identiﬁed with the Jarlskog invariant [11], and the real parts are deﬁned
as

(R123, R231, R312; R132, R213, R321) = (x1, x2, x3; y1, y2, y3).

(2)
The (xi, yj) parameters are bounded, −1 ≤ (xi, yj) ≤ 1, with xi ≥ yj for any pair of (i, j).
It is also found that the six parameters satisfy two conditions,

detV = (x1 + x2 + x3) − (y1 + y2 + y3) = 1,

(x1x2 + x2x3 + x3x1) − (y1y2 + y2y3 + y3y1) = 0,

(3)

(4)

leaving four independent parameters for the mixing matrix. They are related to the Jarlskog
invariant,

and the squared elements of V ,

J 2 = x1x2x3 − y1y2y3.

W = [|Vαi|2] =




x1 − y1 x2 − y2 x3 − y3
x3 − y2 x1 − y3 x2 − y1
x2 − y3 x3 − y1 x1 − y2




The matrix of the cofactors of W , denoted as w with wT W = (detW )I, is given by

w =




x1 + y1 x2 + y2 x3 + y3
x3 + y2 x1 + y3 x2 + y1
x2 + y3 x3 + y1 x1 + y2



The one-loop RGE for the quark mass matrices have been developed and widely studied

[5–7]. In terms of the mass squared matrices for the u-type quarks, Mu = YuY †
for the d-type quarks, Md = YdY †

DMu = auMu + bM 2
DMd = adMd + bM 2

u + c{Mu, Md},
d + c{Mu, Md}.

Here, D ≡ (16π2) d
mass. The model dependence of the RGE is implanted in au, ad, b, and c.

dt and t = ln(µ/MW ), where µ is the energy scale and MW is the W boson

Although the RGE are simple in their matrix forms, one must extract the physical vari-
ables (masses and mixing parameters) from these matrices. This is complicated because
they contain a large number of unphysical degrees of freedom and it is not easy to infer

useful to deduce from Eqs. (16-17) the RGE in terms of the physical variables, which can
then yield direct information on the evolution of these variables. This procedure results in
the following equations on the masses and CKM elements Vij:

It should be emphasized that Eq. (20), as it stands, is not rephasing invariant. The
physical part thereof is obtained by using it only on rephasing invariant combinations of Vij,
such as |Vij|2 or the (x, y) variables deﬁned in Eq. (2). In Ref.[13], we obtained the evolution
equations of xi and yj in the form:

The matrices [Zi], [Z ′

structures of [Zi] and [Z ′
i] mirror those of xi and yi, when written as products of Vij, e.g.,
i]T , which is
x1 = Re(V11V22V33). It is also satisfying to establish [Bi] = [Ai]T and [B′
a consequence of the conjugate roles played by the u-type and d-type quarks. The RGE of

Although [Sij] can be directly written down from [Zi] and [Z ′
Table II, since it will be used for the analyses of DWij in the next section.
The simple and compact form of Eqs. (26-29) can be contrasted with the RGE written
in terms of the standard parametrization (see, e.g., [14]), for which it is hard to ﬁnd any

i], we list them explicitly in

regularity in the structure. It is seen that these equations clearly exhibit symmetries under
permutation of the indices, owing to the same properties inherent in the deﬁnition of the
(x, y) variables. The situation here can be compared to a familiar one in E&M. While the
wave equations take a simple form for the (gauge invariant) ~E and ~B ﬁelds, depending on the
choice of gauge, the corresponding equations for the potential Aµ can be very complicated.
Another salient feature of them is the prominent role played by the rephasing invariants Λγk,
which are the same Jarlskog invariants that appear in formulas of the neutrino oscillation
probabilities, P (να → νβ). Without them the RGE would look rather cumbersome, as
written in Ref.[13]. In addition, they facilitate the calculation of approximate solutions of
the RGE, as we will see in the next section. Lastly, from Eqs. (26), (27), and [Z0] in Table
I, it can be veriﬁed that PD(xi) − PD(yj) = 0 and PD(xixj) − PD(yiyj) = 0, as one
expects from the constraint equations (Eqs. (3) and (4)).
Notice that the evolution equations of Λγk can also be cast in compact forms similar to

that of Wij and J 2:

and the 2 × 2 sub-matrix (indices 2 and 3) has a simple structure, cγk = ±1 ± |Vγk|2,
(γk) = (2, 3). With the condition, Eq. (33), one can construct the 3 × 3 matrix from the
known 2 × 2 matrix. Finally, the evolution equations for the combinations of Λγk, such as
D(Pγ Λγk), D(Pk Λγk), and D(Pγ,k Λγk), can also be cast in similar forms, in which cij are
functions of the elements of Wij and wij. We will not show the details here.

IV. ANALYSIS OF THE RGE

Although the solutions to the quark RGE are not available, it turns out that, under
certain reasonable assumptions, one can ﬁnd approximate solutions for them. To do this we
consider various scenarios of the mass parameters: A) f 2
2 ≫ h2
3 ≫ h2
1.
2 ≫ f 2
B) f 2
1. While case
A) corresponds to the mass patterns at low energy, the other choices are possibilities which

may prevail at some high energy scale. These considerations are useful for model building,
so that one can bridge the mixing patterns between the high and low energy scales. We will
now present the detailed results for case A), but leave the discussion of the other cases to
the Appendix.

For the hierarchical case in A), one may simplify the matrices so that [F23, F31, F12] ≃

[−1, 1,−1] and [H23, H31, H12] ≃ [−1, 1,−1]. In addition,

Despite the complexity of its original forms, the RGE of Wij can be solved approximately.

With c′ = 16π2/[2c(f 2

3 + h2

3)] and aij the initial value of Wij, Eq. (A9) yields

W33 ≃

(a−1

33 − 1)e−(t−t0)/c′ + 1

.

(50)

With the solution of W33, one may in principle solve for W13, W33, and W11. However, we
will not show the long expressions here, but instead further assume the following scenarios
of the couplings to obtain simple, approximate solutions for the rest of Wij. Note that f 2
3
and h2
3 are treated as constants here, i.e., the approximate solutions are only valid for a
range of t values in which the variations of f 2

3 are negligible.

For the purpose of illustration, we show a numerical example in Fig. 1, in which the
approximate solutions for W11, W13, W31, and W33 are compared with the full numerical
solutions. It is seen that although f 2
3 are treated as constants in the approximation,
the resultant solutions agree well with the full numerical solutions in which f 2
3 vary
by a factor 4. Note that due to lack of details at the high energy regimes, the chosen input
at high energy in this example only leads to W11 ≈ 3/5 at low energy.

V. CONCLUSION

One of the corner stones of quantum ﬁeld theories is the RGE of coupling “constants”,
which describe the change of couplings as functions of energy scales. When applied to gauge
couplings, they led to the well-established phenomenon of asymptotic freedom, in addition
to the concept of uniﬁcation, which is a most interesting conjecture for high energy theories.
Given the plethora of masses and mixing parameters, one would hope that RGE can usher

9

in some regularity, or at least certain insights, into this set of seemingly random observables.
However, so far this goal remains largely unfulﬁlled. One obvious obstacle comes from the
complexity of the RGE, when written in terms of the variables of the standard parametriza-
tion. In this paper we obtained evolution equations for a set of rephasing invariant mixing
parameters. They exhibit compact and simple structures, with manifest permutation sym-
metry. Although a full analysis of these equations is still lacking, they are simple enough for
one to ﬁnd approximate solutions under a number of reasonable assumptions for possible
mass parameters. They should be helpful in assessing the viability of proposed theories
at high energies. Hopefully, as we learn more about these equations, we can have a clear
picture of the relations of Higgs couplings between low and high energies.
