Abstract

We give a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of an increasing coupling of N (N > 2)
synchronous dynamics on SZd
(PCA). Increasing means the coupling preserves stochastic ordering.
We ﬁrst present our main construction theorem in the case where S is totally ordered; applications to
attractive PCA’s are given. When S is only partially ordered, we show on two examples that a coupling
of more than two synchronous dynamics may not exist. We also prove an extension of our main result
for a particular class of partially ordered spaces.

1 Introduction

Probabilistic Cellular Automata (abbreviated in PCA) are discrete-time Markov chains on a product
space SΛ (conﬁguration space) whose transition probability is a product measure. S is assumed to be
a ﬁnite set (spin space). We denote by Λ (set of sites) a subset, ﬁnite or inﬁnite, of Zd. Since the
transition probability kernel P (dσ|σ′) (σ, σ′ ∈ SΛ) is a product measure, all interacting elementary
components (spins) {σk : k ∈ Λ} are simultaneously and independently updated (parallel updating).
This synchronous transition is the main feature of PCA and diﬀers from the one in the most common
Gibbs samplers, where only one site is updated at each time step (sequential updating). In opposition

to these sequential updating dynamics, it is simple to deﬁne PCA’s on the inﬁnite set SZd
passing to continuous time.

without

Probabilistic Cellular Automata were ﬁrst studied as Markov chains in the 70’s (see Toom et al.
(1978)). We refer for instance to Louis (2002) for a recent historical overview and a list of applic-
ations of Cellular Automata dynamics, which are to be found in physics, biology, image restoration
(see Younes (1998))... PCA dynamics may present a variety of behaviours. Let us only mention the
following: contrarily to the usual discrete time sequential updating dynamics, for a given measure µ,
there is no canonical way of constructing a PCA for which µ is stationary. Moreover, there exist Gibbs
measures on SZ2
such that no PCA admits them as stationary reversible measures (see Theorem 4.2
in Dawson (1974)).

Coupling refers to the construction of a product probability space on which several dynamics may
evolve simultaneously, and having the property that the marginals coincide with each one of these
dynamics. Coupling techniques for stochastic processes are now well established, powerful tools of
investigation. We refer to Lindvall (1992) and Thorisson (2000) for a more extensive review and ap-
plications to a large scope of probabilistic objects. The ﬁrst use of a coupling of Probabilistic Cellular
Automata is to be found in Vasershtein (1969). It was also used in Maes (1993). Recently, the coupling
constructed in this paper was used to state some necessary and suﬃcient condition for the exponential
ergodicity of attractive PCA’s (see Louis (2004)). This last result relies on the fact that our coupling
preserves a stochastic order between the conﬁgurations (so called increasing coupling). In López and
Sanz (2000), the authors gave necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of a coupling pre-
serving the stochastic order between two PCA’s on SZd
, where S is a partially ordered set. In this
paper, we give a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of an increasing coupling of any
ﬁnite number of possibly diﬀerent PCA dynamics. As some counter examples will show, there is a gap
between the construction of an increasing coupling of two PCA’s and that of an increasing coupling
of N PCA’s with N > 3. Moreover, we give here an explicit algorithmic construction of this coupling,
which is a kind of graphical construction. We also give several examples and general applications of the
constructed coupling. Indeed, the motivation for coupling together three or more PCA’s comes from
the paper Louis (2004), where a comparison between four diﬀerent PCA dynamics proved to be useful.
In section 2 we state our main result, namely the existence, under some necessary and suﬃcient
condition of monotonicity (Deﬁnition 2.2), of an increasing coupling of several PCA dynamics (The-
orem 2.4). Corollary 2.5 states the existence of some universal coupling of any attractive PCA and some
signiﬁcant examples are also presented. In section 3 we prove these results, and state some important
property (Lemma 3.2) of coherence between the diﬀerent couplings. In section 4, we then present some
useful applications of the coupling just constructed. In section 5 we consider the case where S is a
partially ordered set. Two counter-examples show that it may happen that an increasing coupling of
N PCA dynamics does not exist when N > 3. A generalisation of Theorem 2.4 and Corollary 2.5 to
the case where S is partially linearly ordered is presented.

Finally, let us point out that our motivation for considering partially ordered spin spaces comes
from the study of ’block dynamics’, where the siteds are not updated individually, but rather blockwise.
This amounts to consider PCA’s on (Sr)Zd
where r is the number of sites in these blocks (even if S is
totally ordered, Sr is not totally ordered in a natural way).

2 Deﬁnitions and main results

Let S be a ﬁnite set, with a partial order denoted by 4. The conjunction of s 6= s′ and s 4 s′ will

whose transition probability kernel P veriﬁes, for all conﬁgurations
pk( dσk | η ), where for all site k ∈ Zd, pk( . |η) is a

be denoted by s (cid:22) s′. Let P denote a PCA dynamics on the product space SZd
homogeneous Markov Chain on SZd
η ∈ SZd

, σ = (σk)k∈Zd ∈ SZd

, P ( dσ | η ) = ⊗
k∈Zd

probability measure on S, called updating rule. In other words, given the previous time step (n − 1), all
the spin values (ωk(n))k∈Zd at time n are simultaneously and independently updated, each one according
to the probabilistic rule pk( . | (ωk′(n − 1))k′∈Zd). We let P = ⊗
k∈Zd
in this paper are local, which means ∀k ∈ Zd, ∃ Vk ⋐ Zd, pk( . |η) = pk( . |ηVk ). The notation Λ ⋐ Zd
means Λ is a ﬁnite subset of Zd. For any subset ∆ of Zd and for all conﬁgurations σ and η of SZd
, the
conﬁguration σ∆η∆c is deﬁned by σk for k ∈ ∆, ηk elsewhere. We also let σ∆ := (σk)k∈∆ too.

pk. All PCA dynamics considered

All the measures considered in this paper are probability measures. For a probability measure ν
on SZd
(equipped with the Borel σ-ﬁeld associated to the product topology), νP refers to the law at
time 1 of the PCA dynamics with law ν at time 0: νP (dσ) = R P (dσ|η)ν(dη). Recursively, νP (n) =
(νP (n−1))P is the law at time n of the system evolving according to the PCA dynamics P and having
initial law ν. For each measurable function f : SZd
deﬁned
by P (f )(η) = R f (σ)P (dσ|η).
Let us now deﬁne basic notions of stochastic ordering 4. Two conﬁgurations σ and η of SΛ (with
Λ ⊂ Zd) satisfy σ 4 η if ∀k ∈ Λ, σk 4 ηk. A real function f on SΛ will be increasing if σ 4 η ⇒
f (σ) 6 f (η). Thus two probability measures ν1 and ν2 satisfy the stochastic ordering ν1 4 ν2 if, for all
increasing functions f on SΛ, ν1(f ) 6 ν2(f ), with the notation ν(f ) = R f (σ)ν(dσ). Considered as a
Markov chain, a PCA dynamics P on SΛ (Λ ⊂ Zd) is said to be attractive if for all increasing functions
f , P (f ) is still increasing. This requirement is equivalent to (µ1 4 µ2 ⇒ µ1P 4 µ2P ), where µ1, µ2
are two probability measures on SZd

→ R+, P (f ) denotes the function on SZd

ous coupling of (P i)16i6N is a Markovian dynamics Q on (SZd

PCA dynamics, where N > 2 and P i = ⊗

k (1 6 i 6 N ). This N -tuple is said to be increasing if

Since P ( . |σ) is a product measure, according to Proposition 2.9 in Toom et al. (1978), condition (2)
is equivalent to: ∀k ∈ Zd,

Deﬁnition 2.3 (Increasing synchronous coupling) A synchronous coupling Q of an N -tuple (P i)16i6N
of PCA dynamics is said to be an increasing coupling of (P 1, P 2, . . . , P N ) if the following property holds:
for any initial conﬁgurations σ1 4 σ2 4 . . . 4 σN , for any time n > 1,

Q (cid:0) ω1(n) 4 . . . 4 ωN (n) (cid:12)(cid:12) (ω1, . . . , ωN )(0) = (σ1, . . . , σN ) (cid:1) = 1.

(4)

We now state:

Theorem 2.4 Let S be a totally ordered space. Let (P i)16i6N be an N -tuple of PCA dynamics on
SZd

. There exists a synchronous coupling Q of (P i)16i6N if and only if (P 1, . . . , P N ) is increasing.

The increasing coupling we are constructing will be denoted by P 1 ⊛ P 2 ⊛ . . . ⊛ P N . Note that the
property of preserving the order implies that the coupling has the coalescence property. This means
that if two components are taking the same value at some time, then they will remain equal from this
time on (as well as all the components in between). In Lemma 3.3 we will see that if a PCA dynamics P
is attractive, then for all N > 2, the N -tuple (P, P, . . . , P ) is increasing. As an immediate consequence
of Theorem 2.4 and Lemma 3.3 we then have the

Corollary 2.5 Let S be a totally ordered space, P be a PCA dynamics on SZd
exists an increasing coupling P ⊛N of (P, . . . , P ) if and only if P is attractive.

and N > 2. There

Lemma 3.1 from section 3 gives a practical constructive criterion for testing if an N -tuple of PCA
dynamics is increasing or if a PCA is attractive. We use it in the following examples.

A family of PCA dynamics

Let (P βi,hi)16i6N be a family of N PCA dynamics on {−1, +1}Zd

, deﬁned by ∀k ∈ Zd, ∀η ∈ {−1, +1}Zd

,

∀s ∈ S = {−1, +1}

pi
k(s | η) =

(5)

where (βi)16i6N are positive real numbers, (hi)16i6N real numbers, V0 ⋐ Zd and K : V0 → R is an
interaction function between sites which is symmetric.

This example is important, since any reversible PCA dynamics on {−1, +1}Zd

can be presented
in this form 2 . When β is ﬁxed and h1 6 . . . 6 hN , the N -tuple (P β,hi)16i6N is increasing. On
the other hand, note that in the case hi = 0, the assumption β1 6 . . . 6 βN does not imply that
the N -tuple (P βi,0)16i6N is increasing. Consider for instance β1 = 1
2 , β2 = 3, d = 2, K such that
V0 = {−e1, e1, −e2, e2} where (e1, e2) is a basis of R2. Condition (3) is false considering k = 0, ζ 1
V0
consisting of four −1, and ζ 2
V0

of three −1 and one +1.

Example of an attractive PCA dynamics

Let P β,h be some PCA dynamics deﬁned by the updating rule (5) (β > 0, h ∈ R). We know from
Proposition 4.1.2 in Louis (2002) that this dynamics is attractive if and only if K(.) > 0. For a more
systematic study of this class, we refer to Dai Pra et al. (2002) and Louis (2004). From Corollary 2.5,
we can then construct an increasing coupling of such PCA. We show in section 4 how this can be
used.

2 A PCA dynamics is said to be reversible if it admits at least one reversible probability measure (see
subsection 4.1.1 in Louis (2002)).

Assume in this section that S is a totally ordered set. Let us then enumerate the spin set elements
as S = {−, . . . , s, s + 1, . . . , +}, where we denote with + (resp. −) the (necessarily unique) maximum

Proof of Theorem 2.4
Let us explain how to construct explicitly the increasing coupling P 1 ⊛ P 2 ⊛ . . . ⊛ P N .
n being a ﬁxed time index, we need to describe the stochastic transition from (ω1, . . . , ωN )(n) (element
of SN ) to (ω1, . . . , ωN )(n + 1). Let (Uk)k∈Λ be a family of independent random variables, distributed
uniformaly on ]0, 1[. Since we are constructing a synchronous coupling, it is enough to deﬁne the rule
for a ﬁxed site k ∈ Zd. Let r denote a ﬁxed realisation of the random variable Uk and use the following
algorithmic rule to choose the value ωi

k(n + 1) for any i (1 6 i 6 N ):

if F i

k(s − 1, ωi(n)) < r 6 F i

k(s, ωi(n)), − (cid:22) s, assign ωi

Finally, remark that the stochastic dependence between the components 1 6 i 6 N comes from
the fact that we are using the same realisation r of Uk for all components. It is easy to check that this
coupling preserves stochastic ordering assuming that (P 1, . . . , P N ) is increasing, since it is equivalent
to check (6) (Lemma 3.1).

Conversely, the condition (6) is necessary. Assume the existence of a synchronous coupling (qk)k∈Zd
of N PCA dynamics on SZd
which preserves stochastic ordering. This means that for ζ 1 4 . . . 4 ζ N ,
qk( . |(ζ 1, . . . , ζ N )) > 0 only on (SN )+, where (SN )+ is the subset {(s1, . . . , sN ) : s1 4 . . . 4 sN } of
SN . Let s ∈ S, 1 6 i < N , and ζ 1 4 . . . 4 ζ N be ﬁxed. Using the condition (1) on the i-th marginal
of a coupling, we have

One may readily notice the compatibility property satisﬁed by this coupling, and whose proof is straight-
forward according to its construction.

Conversely, assume (P, P ) is increasing. Then relation (6) holds with the same dynamics on the
two components. Let f be an increasing function on SZd
, f (σ) = f (σk).
According to formula (7), we conclude that P (f ) is increasing. Recursively, we can state the same result
for all local functions, because of the product form of the kernels. Since S is ﬁnite, SZd
is compact, and
a density argument gives the conclusion. ✷

4 Applications

Using the increasing coupling, we develop a precise analysis of the structure of the set of PCA

dynamics’ stationary measures. Moreover, the time-asymptotical behaviour is investigated.

Let us ﬁrst prove a property (Proposition 4.1) for stationary measures associated to PCA restricted
on SΛ (Λ ⋐ Zd) (see formula (10)). The relation between these measures and the stationary measures for
the PCA dynamics on SZd
is then established (Proposition 4.2). In particular, we formulate an identity
relating spatial limits and temporal limits (see equations (13) and (14)). Proposition 4.4 establishes a
comparison between inﬁnite volume PCA’s (e.g. Λ = Zd) and PCA’s in a large but ﬁnite volume. See
also Louis (2004) for applications.

In the following P is an attractive PCA dynamics on SZd

, where S is a totally ordered space.

boundary conditions satisfy some sub/super-DLR relation (which means these measures are ‘sub/super-

4.2 Comparison of ﬁnite & inﬁnite volume PCA

Thanks to the above constructed coupling, we investigate the time-asymptotical behaviour. The
PCA dynamics P on the inﬁnite volume space SZd
considered in this subsection is assumed to be
translation invariant (or space homogeneous): ∀k ∈ Zd, ∀s ∈ S, ∀η ∈ SZd
, pk( s | η ) = p0( s | θ−kη ),
where θk0(σ) = (σk−k0)k∈Zd. Remark that if the PCA dynamics P i are translation invariant, so is the
coupled dynamics P 1 ⊛ . . . ⊛ P N .

We will use the notation P to denote the coupling P ⊛ P ⊛ . . . ⊛ P of N times the same attractive
PCA dynamics P . Using the compatibility property of the Lemma 3.2, the marginal of P ⊛N ′
on N
components chosen in {1, .., N ′} is the same as the coupling P ⊛N . Here, it is enough to choose N = 4.

time-asymptotical behaviour of our PCA is controlled by the sequence (ρ(n))n>1, where

As Proposition 4.2 shows, in order to study the behaviour of a PCA dynamics P on SZd

(ω1, ω2)(0) = (−−−, +++)(cid:17),

where P is the coupling introduced in Corollary 2.5. In the paper Louis (2004) we gave conditions to
ensure the convergence of (ρ(n))n>1 and stated conditions for the ergodicity with exponential speed of
the dynamics P .

Let Λ ⋐ Zd. Let P +++

Λ (cid:0)ω(n) ∈ .(cid:12)(cid:12)ω(0) = ξΛ(+++)Λc(cid:1).

The sequence (ρ(n))n∈N∗ is decreasing, and P is ergodic if and only if limn→∞ ρ(n) = 0. Moreover, in
this case,

PROOF. The proof of the left inequality in (18) is straightforward using the compatibility property
from Lemma 3.2. The right inequality comes from the confunction of two properties: preservation of
the stochastic order as well as the compatibility property of the coupling P −−−

Λ ⊛ P ⊛ P ⊛ P +++
Λ .

Since the coupling P −

Λ ⊛ P ⊛ P +

Λ is increasing, (19) is a consequence of the fact that any initial

condition ξ in SZd

satisﬁes ξΛ(−−−)Λc 4 ξ 4 ξΛ(+++)Λc.

The monotonicity of the sequence (ρ(n))n∈N∗ comes from the coalescence property of the increasing

coupling P.

If P is ergodic, there can be only one stationary measure on SZd

5 Partially ordered spin space case

In all this section, S is a partially ordered space. When S is totally ordered, a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for the existence of an increasing coupling of PCA dynamics is given in section 3 by
the inequality (6). It is done in term of the distribution function Fk(., σ) (σ given) of the probability
pk( . |σ). We recall previous results, who gave a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of
an increasing coupling of two PCA’s. In particular, P is attractive if and only if

∀k ∈ Zd, ∀σ 4 η, ∀ Γ up-set in S ⇒ Ps∈Γ

pk(s|σ) 6 Ps∈Γ

pk(s|η).

(21)

The quantity which now makes sense is the generalised function Fk(Γ, σ) := Ps′∈Γ pk(s′|σ), where Γ
is an up-set of S (see Deﬁnition 5.1).
Nevertheless, there is a gap between coupling two PCA’s or more than three PCA’s. The counter-
examples A and B presented here show that a satisfactory coupling of three PCA’s may not exist and
condition (21) of López and Sanz (2000) is not suﬃcient for the existence of an increasing 3-coupling
when S is any partially ordered space.

These counter-examples rely on examples 1.1 and 5.7 in Fill and Machida (2001) of stochastic-
ally monotone families of distributions, indexed by a partially ordered set, which are not realisable
monotone in the following sense. Let (Qα)α∈A be a family of probability distributions on a ﬁnite set S
indexed by a partially ordered set A. Fill and Machida (2001) deﬁne the system (Qα)α∈A as stochastic-
ally monotone if α14A α2 implies Qα1 4S Qα2. It is said to be realisable monotone if there exists a
system of S-valued random variables (Xα)α∈A , deﬁned on the same probability space, such that the
distribution of Xα is Qα and α14A α2 implies Xα1 4S Xα2 a.s.

In our case, the existence of a coupling of the N PCA dynamics (P 1, . . . , P N ) implies that, for any
k ∈ Zd ﬁxed, the system {pk(.|σVk ) : σVk ∈ SVk } of probability distributions on S, which is indexed

10

by the partially ordered set SVk , is realisable monotone. In the counter-examples presented here, the
distributions are stochastically monotone but not realisable monotone.

Deﬁnition 5.1 A subset Γ of S is said to be an up-set (or increasing set) (resp. down-set or decreasing
set) if: x ∈ Γ, y ∈ S, x 4 y ⇒ y ∈ Γ (resp. x ∈ Γ, y ∈ S, x < y ⇒ y ∈ Γ).

Note that the indicator function of an up-set (resp. down-set) is an increasing (resp. decreasing)
function. Moreover, Theorem 1 in Kamae et al. (1977) states that for two measures µ1, µ2 on S,
µ1 4 µ2 if and only if µ1(Γ) 6 µ2(Γ) for all up-sets Γ of S, which is equivalent to µ1(Γ) > µ2(Γ) for
all down-sets Γ of S.

Counter-Example A

Let S = SA = {0, 1}2 be equipped with the natural partial order (0, 0) 4 (0, 1), (0, 0) 4 (1, 0),

(0, 1) 4 (1, 1), (1, 0) 4 (1, 1) (where (0, 1) and (1, 0) are not comparable). Let P = ⊗
k∈Zd

pk, where

pk( . |σ) = pk( . |σk) is deﬁned as follows:

pk( . |(0, 0)) = 1
pk( . |(1, 0)) = 1
pk( . |(0, 1)) = 1
pk( . |(1, 1)) = 1

2 (δ(0,0) + δ(1,0))
2 (δ(0,0) + δ(1,1))
2 (δ(0,1) + δ(1,0))
2 (δ(1,0) + δ(1,1)).



(22)

It is simple to check that this PCA dynamics is attractive. Nevertheless, P ⊛4 can not exist since
(pk( . |(0, 0)), pk ( . |(1, 0)), pk ( . |(0, 1)), pk ( . |(1, 1))) is a stochastically monotone family which is not
realisable monotone (see example 1.1 in Fill and Machida (2001)). This PCA is in fact a collection of
independent, S-valued Markov Chains, whose transition probability is p0(.|.). This example states the
non-existence of a coupling of four particular Markov Chains.

Counter-Example B

Let S = SB = {x, y, z, w}, considered with the following partial order x 4 z, y 4 z, z 4 w

and x and y are not comparable. Consider the dimension d = 1, and the PCA P = ⊗
k∈Z

pk where

pk( . |σ) = pk( . |σ{k,k+1}) is deﬁned as follows:

pk( . |(x, y)) = 1
pk( . |(x, z)) = 1
pk( . |(z, y)) = 1
pk( . |(z, z)) = 1

2 (δx + δy)
2 (δx + δw)
2 (δy + δw)
2 (δz + δw)

pk( . |(y, z)) = δz

pk( . |(z, x)) = δz

pk( . |(x, x)) = δx

pk( . |(y, x)) = δz

pk( . |(y, y)) = δy

pk( . |otherwise) = δw




(23)

This is an attractive PCA, nevertheless a synchronous coupling P ⊛4 can not exist since
(pk( . |(x, y)), pk( . |(x, z)), pk( . |(z, y)), pk( . |(z, z))) is a stochastically monotone family which is also
non realisable monotone (see example 5.7 in Fill and Machida (2001)).

Let us now present some generalisation of our main results, Theorem 2.4 and Corollary 2.5, when
the spin space S belongs to a special class Z of partially ordered sets introduced in Fill and Machida

11

(2001) and called linearly ordered spaces.

We call predecessor (resp. successor) of s (s ∈ S) any element s′ such that s 4 s′ (resp. s < s′)
and s 4 s′′ 4 s′ ⇒ s′′ ∈ {s, s′} (resp. s < s′′ < s′ ⇒ s′′ ∈ {s, s′}). S belongs to the class Z if,
for any s ∈ S, only one of the following situations occurs: s admits exactly one successor and one
predecessor; s admits no predecessor and at most two successors; s admits no sucessor and at most two
predecessors. One can then deﬁne on S a linear order 6n by numbering the elements of S: {s1, . . . , sn}
(where n = #S) in such a way that si+1 be a sucessor or a predecessor of Si (for i = 1, . . . , n) and
declaring that si 6n sj if i 6 j. Of course such linear order might be incompatible with the partial
order 4 originally deﬁned on S.
The set SC = {si, 1 6 i 6 10} with order relations: s1 4 s2 4 s3 4 s4, s6 4 s5 4 s4, s6 4 s7 4 s8, and
s10 4 s9 4 s8 is an example of such a space. On the other hand, the spin space SD = {x, y, z, u, v, w}
with order relations y 4 z, x 4 z, w 4 z, w 4 u, w 4 v does not belong to this class.

Deﬁne, for si ∈ S (1 6 i 6 n), the subset (←, si] of S with (←, si] = {sj ∈ S : sj 6n si}. The
sets (←, s] (with s ∈ S) are either up-sets or down-sets of S (respective to the original order 4 on S).
For instance, when S = SC, (←, s5] is an up-set and (←, s6] is a down-set. It suﬃces to consider the
generalised function Fk(Γ, σ) for sets of the form Γ = (←, s] for which we have:

Fk(s, σ) = pk( (←, s] | σ) = Ps′∈(←,s]

pk(s′|σ)

(s ∈ S, σ ∈ SZd

).

(24)

When S is a linearly ordered set, the monotonicity condition (3) is equivalent to the following
conditions for the generalised associated distribution functions (Lemma 5.5 in Fill and Machida (2001)):
∀k ∈ Zd, ∀(ζ 1, ζ 2, . . . , ζ N ) ∈ (SZd

)N such that ζ 1 4 ζ 2 4 . . . 4 ζ N ,

∀s ∈ S with (←, s] down-set, F 1
∀s ∈ S with (←, s] up-set, F 1

k (s | ζ 1) > F 2
k (s | ζ 1) 6 F 2

k (s | ζ 2) > . . . > F N
k (s | ζ 2) 6 . . . 6 F N

k (s | ζ N ).
k (s | ζ N )

(25)

(26)

Proposition 5.2 When S is a linearly ordered spin space, Theorem 2.4 and Corollary 2.5 still hold.

PROOF. The proof of such results relies on the following construction. Let us deﬁne the generalised
probability transform, for σ ∈ SZd

{sk : t < Fk(sk, σ)},

and k ∈ Zd ﬁxed: (Fk( . , σ))−1(t) = inf
6n

(t ∈]0, 1[), where the inﬁmum is given in term of the linear order 6n. The construction of the increas-
ing coupling holds as before thanks to the following evolution rule (9) between times n and n + 1,
k)−1 denotes the generalised distribution function, as introduced before. The coherence of this
where (F i
coupling with the partial order 4 is proved in Lemma 6.2 in Fill and Machida (2001). ✷
