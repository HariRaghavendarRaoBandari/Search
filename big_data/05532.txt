Abstract: We consider the determination of the ﬁnite temperature phase transition in
the Yang–Mills SU(3) gauge theory. We compute the diﬀerence of the spatial and temporal
energy density at a physical Wilson ﬂow time. This diﬀerence is zero in the conﬁned phase
and becomes non zero in the deconﬁned phase. We locate the phase transition by using a
new technique based on an exponential smoothing spline. This method is an alternative
to the determination of the phase transition based on the Polyakov loop susceptibility and
can also be used with dynamical fermions.

Introduction

The pure SU(3) gauge theory at ﬁnite temperature exhibits a ﬁrst order phase transition
separating the conﬁned phase at low temperature from the deconﬁned phase at high tem-
perature. The standard way to locate the critical temperature by Monte Carlo simulations
is based on the computation of the susceptibility of the Polyakov loop. The position of
the peak of the susceptibility determines the temperature and the scaling of the peak value
with the spatial volume identiﬁes the order of the transition.

In this work we study an alternative method to locate the phase transition based on
the energy density computed using the Wilson ﬂow. We separate the spatial and temporal
components of the energy density. Their diﬀerence is zero in the conﬁned phase and becomes
non zero in the deconﬁned phase. This behaviour allows to locate the phase transition.
Technically we propose to use an exponential smoothing spline to ﬁt the data of the energy
diﬀerence. We give explicit formulae for the construction of such a spline. We deﬁne the
critical temperature to correspond to the maximum slope of the spline. We verify by Monte
Carlo simulations that the new method agrees with the results of the standard method
based on the Polyakov loop susceptibility.

The motivation to look at an alternative method to locate the phase transition is that
in QCD with dynamical fermions one usually uses the peak of the chiral susceptibility
to locate the phase transition or cross over (depending on the quark mass), which is a

computationally expensive quantity. The method based on the energy diﬀerence which we
describe in this paper can be applied also in presence of dynamical fermions.

2 Finite temperature phase transition

The ﬁnite temperature can be investigated on lattices where the time extension Nt is much
smaller than the spatial one Ns. This means, it should at least hold Ns ≥ 4·Nt as described
in [1]. The temperature T is related to the time extension by the equation

T (β) =

1

Nt · a(β)

with lattice spacing a(β). This implies for a given Nt, there is a critical coupling βc such
that the critical temperature can be computed via Tc(βc). Finally, the critical temperature
can be computed in physical units, for example, as

Tc[MeV] =

r0/a(βc)
Nt · r0

· c =

r0/a(βc)
Nt · 0.49

· 197.3 MeV

(2.1)

with c = 197.3 MeV fm and r0 = 0.49 fm [2]. The formula for the determination of the
scale r0/a(β) is

ln(a/r0) = −1.6804 − 1.7331(β − 6) + 0.7849(β − 6)2 − 0.4428(β − 6)3

(2.2)

for 5.7 ≤ β ≤ 6.92 and explained in [3].

2.1 Polyakov loop susceptibility
Usually, the critical coupling βc is determined using the Polyakov loop susceptibility. The
lattice average P of the Polyakov loop is computed as

P =

(cid:126)x

nt=1

U ((cid:126)x, nt)

which is the mean of the product of links U ((cid:126)x, nt) in time direction nt for each 3d-spatial
vector (cid:126)x. As the lattice average P is a complex number, the Polyakov loop susceptibility
χp is the variance of its absolute value |P|,

s ·(cid:16)(cid:104)|P|2(cid:105) − (cid:104)|P|(cid:105)2(cid:17)

.

χp := N 3

For a given lattice of size (Nt, N 3
s ), the coupling constant β has to be chosen and through
Monte Carlo simulation an ensemble of gauge conﬁgurations is generated. The expectation
value in the ensemble of the Polyakov loop susceptibility (cid:104)χp(β)(cid:105) can be computed. This
has to be done for several values of β around the critical coupling βc such that the curve
(β,(cid:104)χp(cid:105))k for k = 1, . . . , nβ contains a peak around βc. The desired value βc is found by a ﬁt
of the data, for example, with a smoothing spline s(β). The critical coupling βc is computed
as the value of β at which the ﬁt s(β) reaches its maximum value. Fixing Nt and varying
Ns leads to several values βc(χp, Nt, Ns) of the critical coupling. Figure 1 shows the results
of the simulations which we will describe in section 4. At the end, a linear extrapolation in
1/N 3

s leads to the desired critical coupling βc(χp, Nt,∞) for inﬁnite volume.

tibility, here for Nt = 8. The data are ﬁtted by an exponential smoothing spline and the critical
coupling is determined via its maximum.

2.2 The Wilson ﬂow
The Wilson ﬂow [4–6] V (t) is a ﬂow of lattice gauge ﬁelds and it is deﬁned as the solution
of the ordinary Lie group diﬀerential equation

(cid:0)V (t)(cid:1) · Vx,µ(t)

˙Vx,µ(t) = Zx,µ

(2.3)

with link variables Vx,µ(t) being elements of the special unitary Lie group SU(3) and a
function Zx,µ(V (t)) which takes values in the Lie algebra su(3). Particularly, the function
Zx,µ is the Lie derivative Zx,µ

(cid:0)V (t)(cid:1) = −∂/∂Vx,µ(t)SW of the Wilson action

(cid:88)

SW =

ReTr{1 − Vp(t)}

p

such that it depends not only on the link itself but also on its staples. SW is the sum
over all oriented plaquettes p and Vp(t) is the product of link variables around one of these
plaquettes p, see [7]. The Wilson ﬂow (2.3) can be integrated numerically with initial
values V (t0) taken from an ensemble of conﬁgurations generated for a particular value of
the coupling constant β. The numerical integration is performed up to a certain ﬂow time
and during this computation gauge invariant observables of interest are measured. Thereby,
we focus on the energy density

with lattice spacing a and symmetric ﬁeld strength tensor Gµν as described in [7].

the conﬁned phase (blue) with values of β < βc the diﬀerence ∆E in the spatial and the temporal
part of the energy is approximately 0, ∆E (cid:29) 0 in the deconﬁned phase (red).

2.3 Diﬀerence in the Wilson energy
We investigate the mean energy density (cid:104)E(cid:105) described in equation (2.4) on a four-dimensional
lattice with ﬁxed temporal lattice size Nt = 8. Particularly, we focus on the mean spatial
and temporal part of the energy (cid:104)Ess(cid:105) and (cid:104)Est(cid:105) and its diﬀerence (cid:104)∆E(cid:105) := (cid:104)Est − Ess(cid:105).
The splitting in the temporal and spatial part is done as follows numbering the di-
mensions 0, 1, 2, 3 with 0 being the time dimension: the spatial planes are (1, 2), (1, 3), and
(2, 3) and the temporal ones (0, k) with k = 1, 2, 3. Here, the exact formulae for the spatial
part of the energy Ess and the temporal one Est are

The critical coupling βc divides the conﬁned phase and the deconﬁned phase. In the conﬁned
phase, the values of β are smaller than βc, in the deconﬁned one larger. It is known from
[1] that the critical coupling for lattices with Nt = 8 is at βc=6.0625. For a ﬁrst test, we
simulated lattices with β = 6.03 < βc and β = 6.07 > βc and computed (cid:104)Ess(cid:105), (cid:104)Est(cid:105) and
its diﬀerence (cid:104)∆E(cid:105) as a function of the ﬂow time. It can be seen in ﬁgure 2 that in the
conﬁned phase (blue) with values of β smaller than βc there is no diﬀerence in the spatial
and the temporal part of the energy. On the other hand, in the deconﬁned phase (red) with
values of β larger than βc, there is a diﬀerence in both parts of the energy. This implies,
the spatial and temporal mean energy densities (cid:104)Ess(cid:105) and (cid:104)Est(cid:105) coincide in the conﬁned
phase and diﬀer in the deconﬁned one. In the following paragraphs, we ﬁx a certain ﬂow

the deconﬁned one. This advises that the critical coupling can be found using the energy
diﬀerence at a certain ﬂow time.

2.4 The energy diﬀerence method
We developed a new method1 for the detection of the critical temperature and called it
the energy diﬀerence method. Therefore, we consider the Wilson ﬂow and focus on the
t/r0. The
diﬀerence in the spatial and temporal energy density at a certain ﬂow time
critical coupling βc can be computed by a ﬁt through an exponential smoothing spline
developed in [9]. The idea is to combine smoothing splines, which approximate the data in
a spline setting, with an exponential spline, such that undesired oscillations not given in the
data are avoided (see section 3 for more details). For the detection of the critical coupling,
we proceed as follows similarly to the standard Polyakov loop susceptibility approach: ﬁrst,
we ﬁx a lattice size (Nt, Ns) and the values of βk for k = 1, . . . , nβ. Then, we need the
results of a HMC or heat bath simulation for these values as input for the Wilson ﬂow.
Moreover, the Wilson ﬂow has to be computed up to a certain simulation time which
has to be determined such that the statistical errors are minimized. We ﬁxed the time
√
t/r0 = 0.15 as described in paragraph 4.2. Additionally, the values for the spatial and
temporal energy density have to be measured for the ﬂow time
t/r0 = 0.15. After the
simulation, an exponential smoothing spline s(β) is determined to ﬁt the data (β,(cid:104)∆E(cid:105)).
s ) is determined as
The critical coupling βc(∆E, Nt, Ns) for the speciﬁc lattice size (Nt, N 3
value of β where the steepest gradient of the spline s(β) occurs. This has to be repeated
for a few spatial lattice sizes Ns such that the values βc(∆E, Nt, Ns) can be extrapolated
towards an inﬁnite space dimension Ns = ∞ in order to compute βc(∆E, Nt,∞) for the
ﬁnite temperature phase transition in inﬁnite volume. Figure 3 shows the results of the
simulations which we will describe in section 4.

3 Exponential smoothing splines

The class of exponential smoothing splines approximates data with uncertainties avoiding
undesired oscillations. It couples the ideas of smoothing splines [10] with exponential splines
[11, 12]. Here, we explain the idea of exponential smoothing splines and give the necessary
formulae for its implementation. The mathematical essentials can be found in [9] based on
[13] .

Idea

3.1
We start with data (xi, yi) with errors wi, i = 1, . . . , n. The data should be approximated
by a spline s(x) within the region of their errors and, moreover, no artiﬁcial oscillations

1In the course of our work the article [8] appeared, which also uses this method.

and piecewise constant tension functions Λ(x) = λi > 0 with x ∈ [xi, xi+1) for i = 1, . . . , n.
Here, Λ(x) avoid undesired oscillations, the weights wi are correlated to the errors of yi and
the smoothing parameter S deﬁnes how much the approximated values f (xi) may diﬀer
from yi. There are three limiting cases which coincide with already known kinds of splines:

• λ = 0, S = 0 describes the well-known cubic spline,
• λ = 0, S (cid:54)= 0 leads to the smoothing spline which approximates the data; it may lead

to oscillations not given in the data,

• and λ (cid:54)= 0, S = 0 results in the exponential spline (also known as spline under tension)

interpolating the data exactly avoiding oscillations not given in the data.

(3.1)
for x ∈ [xi, xi+1) and coeﬃcients si, si+1, di, di+1, µi and λi for all intervals i = 1, . . . , n− 1.

(3.1).

3.3 Linear equations for the unknowns
So, for given data (xi, yi), i = 1, . . . , n, the coeﬃcients si and di can be computed via the

Thus, U and D are of size n × n, T of size (n − 2) × (n − 2) and and Q of size n × (n − 2).

These formulae still depend on the unknowns λi and µi = λi · hi. According to [12], the
tension parameters λi can be chosen as uniformly distributed random values in the interval
[4hi, 15hi].

Finally, the Lagrange parameter p is still unknown and can be computed by F (p)2 = S

with

F (p) = ||pD−1(U − QT −1QT − pD−2)−1D−2y − pD−2y||2 .

This can be done, for example, by a Newton iteration or interval nesting. Thereby, it must
be taken into account that the starting value p(0) = 0 should be avoided since it would lead
to vectors s = 0, d = 0 and therefore to a spline s(x) = 0, see [9].

s with Nt = 8
and Ns = {32, 40, 48}. Taking the gauge conﬁgurations of the HMC simulations as initial
values for the Wilson ﬂow, we computed the Wilson ﬂow up to
t/r0 = 0.15 and measured
its spatial and temporal energy density. Statistical errors and autocorrelation times are
computed with the method of [16]. Besides, we computed the Polyakov loop susceptibility
along the Wilson ﬂow for comparison reasons.

4.1 Determination of the critical temperature
For the determination of the critical temperature, we computed the mean energy diﬀerence
(cid:104)∆E(cid:105) for all β at the ﬂow time
t/r0 = 0.15 and for each lattice separately. Then, the
data (β,(cid:104)∆E(cid:105)) are ﬁtted by exponential smoothing splines s(β), see ﬁgure 3. Here, the
smoothing parameter S is set to S = 2 and the weights wi used in the matrix D are set
to the statistical errors of (cid:104)∆E(cid:105)i. Note that a small variation of S does not change the
result; if S is chosen too large, the exponential smoothing spline does not ﬁt each value of
(cid:104)∆E(cid:105) in the region of its error δ(cid:104)∆E(cid:105) . The maximum of the slope s(cid:48)(β) of this spline leads
to the critical coupling βc(∆E, Nt, Ns) which is the value of β at which s(cid:48)(cid:48)(β) = 0 holds.
The errors δβc(∆E, Nt, Ns) are computed by a small variation of the single values of (cid:104)∆E(cid:105)
using the Gaussian error propagation law:

with perturbed value ∆Ek; we use 10 percent of the error of (cid:104)∆E(cid:105)k.

Figure 4. The critical couplings βc(Ns = {32, 40, 48}) for the diﬀerent lattice sizes and Nt =
8 are shown for the energy diﬀerence method (red diamonds) and the standard Polyakov loop
susceptibility approach (blue circles). The extrapolated values βc(∆E, Ns = ∞) and βc(χp, Ns =
∞) of both methods coincide. The black cross represents the reference value βc(Nt = 8, Ns = ∞) =
6.0624(12) from [17].

At the end, a linear extrapolation in 1/N 3

s leads to the ﬁnal value βc(∆E, Nt = 8, Ns =
∞) = 6.0601(11) which is shown in ﬁgure 4. It agrees within errors with the value 6.0624(12)
computed in [17]. Using equation (2.2) this result translates to Tcr0 = 0.7426(14)(37), where
the ﬁrst error is the uncertainty in βc and the second one is a 0.5% error for r0/a computed
from equation (2.2). For comparison reasons, we determined the critical coupling from our
data with the standard Polyakov loop susceptibility approach described in paragraph 2.1
and shown in ﬁgure 1. Also this method leads to a critical coupling βc(χp, Nt = 8,∞) =
6.0602(7) close to the value given in the literature [17]. Both methods lead to very consistent
values of the critical coupling and also the size of the errors are of the same magnitude.

4.2 Statistical errors at diﬀerent ﬂow times

We investigated the statistical errors of both methods at diﬀerent ﬂow times. For the
Polyakov loop susceptibility, the relative statistical errors do not change during the ﬂow.
The Wilson ﬂow has just an eﬀect on its absolute value, see ﬁgure 5. Therefore, it would
be no advantage to combine the Wilson ﬂow and the Polyakov loop susceptibility. On
the other hand, the statistical errors for the energy diﬀerence method have a minimum
at
t/r0 = 0.15. We checked that this ﬂow time is large enough such that cut-oﬀ eﬀects
(measured by comparing diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the energy density) are small and therefore
the best choice for the computation of the critical temperature.

√

The statistical errors already include autocorrelation eﬀects shown in ﬁgure 6 which

are quite large close to the critical coupling. For this reason, long simulations have to
be run for these values of the coupling constant β such that the number of independent
conﬁgurations is large enough. Surprisingly, the number of independent conﬁgurations for
the energy diﬀerence at ﬂow time
t/r0 = 0.15 is for almost all values of β (except at βc)
larger than the one of the Polyakov loop susceptibility at
t/r0 = 0, mentioned in table
1. This means, the number of conﬁgurations needed for the energy diﬀerence method is
smaller than for standard approach.

4.3 Conclusion and outlook

For pure gauge theory, it is possible to detect the critical coupling βc via the energy dif-
ference of the Wilson ﬂow. Our results agree with the standard method as well as with
the reference value given in [1] and [17]. For the energy diﬀerence method, the Wilson
ﬂow has to be computed in addition to the HMC. This is a disadvantage compared to the
standard approach but just a small one, since the energy diﬀerence can be evaluated at
small ﬂow times. For most values of β the statistical errors of the energy diﬀerence method
are smaller than for the standard approach such that the simulation has to be run for less
conﬁgurations to reach the same amount of independent conﬁgurations.

Moreover, our results are promising for simulations with fermions. Our method can
be used as alternative to the expensive computation of the chiral susceptibility, which is
usually taken in this case. Our technique based on the exponential smoothing spline is also
suitable for other applications, as it allows to ﬁt a smooth function through a data set and
compute its derivatives. Additionally, the integration of the Wilson ﬂow can be improved
by using better integrators. For example, adaptive step size methods developed in [18] and
[19] reduce at the same time the computational cost and are able to control the statistical
errors.
