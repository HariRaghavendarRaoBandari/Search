Thermal stability of the topological color code in presence of a thermal bath is studied. We
study the Lindblad evolution of the observables in the weak coupling limit of the Born-Markov
approximation. The auto-correlation functions of the observables are used as a ﬁgure of merit for the
thermal stability. We show that all of the observables auto-correlation functions decay exponentially
in time. By ﬁnding a lower bound of the decay rate, which is a constant independent of the system
size, we show that the Topological Color Code is unstable against thermal ﬂuctuations from the
bath at ﬁnite temperature, even though it is stable at T=0 against local quantum perturbations.

INTRODUCTION

2

The fragility of the qubits in presence of decoherence and external noise is the biggest obstacle in realizing a scalable
quantum computer. To overcome such problems, Quantum error correcting codes have been invented[1–8]. The main
idea of the error correcting codes is to code information in a many particle system, this many particle system plays
the role of a stable logical qubit. However the error correcting models also cause errors themselves and the error
threshold below which, one can do fault tolerant Quantum computation is very low [9, 10].

Topological quantum codes have emerged as the most promising candidates to achieve fault tolerant quantum
computation. In these models information is stored in global properties of the model, say topologically degenerate
ground states of the system. In particular, this kind of coding is shown to be robust against local perturbations from
the environment provided they are local in space and time and they occur at T=0 temperature. Examples of good
topological codes are Kitaev Code [11] and Topological Color Code (TCC) [12]. A very important ﬁgure of merit to
assess the goodness of a topological code is the error threshold. When only qubit errors occur, the error threshold
for the TCC turns out to match the one by the Kitaev model, namely, 11% [13, 14]. However, for more realistic
situations when the measurement process is also prone to errors, the TCC threshold is 4.5 % [15, 16], even better
than the one for the Kitaev Code which is 2.9 % [17].

Topological Color Codes have shown very versatile properties for doing fault-tolerant quantum computation. In
2D, a TCC can implement the Cliﬀord group of gates in a transversal way [12]; this implementation of Cliﬀord group
with TCC makes quantum teleportation, distillation of entanglement and dense coding possible in a fully topological
manner. Moreover, three dimensional extensions of TCC can also achieve universal quantum computation [18]. The
ﬁrst realization of this model has been done in [19].

An open problem is to ﬁnd topological codes resilient to thermal ﬂuctuations from the environment. A ﬁrst indica-
tion that the behavior of topological codes may be diﬀerent at non-zero temperature was advance in [13, 14], and then
it was conﬁrmed by a rigorous proof in [20, 21] within the setting of the dynamics of quantum open systems governed
by Lindblad dynamics. It has been shown in [20, 21] that the Kitaev model in 2 spacial dimension is not a stable
memory in presence of a thermal bath . Interestingly enough, it is possible to stabilize topological codes under thermal
noise provided the lattice system can be deﬁned in higher spatial dimensions. Namely, a thermally robust topological
quantum memory in D=4 spatial dimensions can be constructed with the Kitaev code [22], and a fully ﬂedged univer-
sal quantum computer robust to thermal noise can be constructed in D=6 dimensions with topological color codes [23].

In this paper we address the problem of thermal stability of TCC in a 2-dimensional lattice, based on a mathemati-
cally rigorous analysis of the thermal eﬀects on the model, the method is similar to the one that is used in [21]. To this
end, we study the dynamics of the TCC, weakly interacting with a heat bath in the Born-Markov approximation. The
evolution of the observables governed by Lindblad dynamics and their auto-correlation function in time is studied as a
tool for proving the instability of this model; and we show that all of the observables auto-correlation functions decay
exponentially with a constant decay rate which means that the model in unstable against thermal noise, although it
is stable against local quantum perturbation at zero temperature.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we review the main features of the TCC. In Sec. III we
provide some basic result of the Markovian approximation in the weak coupling limit. Sec. IV deals with reviewing
the stability and instability conditions of the topological memories. In Sec. V these conditions are checked for the
case of TCC and its instability is proved rigorously. Finally Sec. VI is devoted to conclusion. In appendix A, we
prove the negativity of Lindblad super-operator.

II. TOPOLOGICAL COLOR CODE

Topological Color Code is a class of topological codes that can be deﬁned on any three colorable lattice, where by
colorable we mean colorable by face or equivalently by edge [12]. In the present work, we consider a 2-dimensional
hexagonal lattice, 2-colex [24], on which the periodic boundary conditions are imposed on both sides. This lattice
consists of N plaquettes, 2N vertices and 3N edges. A three colorable lattice is a lattice which one can color its
plaquettes with three diﬀerent colors (Red, Green, Blue[25]) in a way that the plaquettes with the same color do not
share any links. Each link connects two plaquettes with the same color and therefore one can ascribe every link with
this special color.

(a) The non-trivial loops C1 and C2 turn around the torus once. (b) The non-trivial loops C1 and C2 turn around the torus
three times and they pass all of the plaquettes which have the same color.

The qubits, in this model, live on the vertices. The Hamiltonian of the model consists of two kinds of plaquette

operators, Bx

p and Bz

p, which are deﬁned as follows:

where σx and σz are ordinary Pauli operators. The Hamiltonian is given by:

Bx

p =Yi∈p

σx,i,

Bz

p =Yi∈p

σz,i,

H = −JXp

Bx

p − JXp

Bz
p .

(1)

(2)

All of the operators in the Hamiltonian commute with each other, since they either share two qubits or none. Thus the
Hamiltonian is exactly solvable. The plaquette operators also square to identity and therefore have ±1 eigenvalues.
One should note that there are 2N qubits and 2N stabilizers[26] in the Hamiltonian. Nevertheless all of these

stabilizers are not independent, because of these constrains on the torus:

Yp∈R

Bσ

p = Yp∈B

Bσ

p = Yp∈G

Bσ
p ,

σ = x, z.

(3)

The number of constrains for each type of plaquette operators ({Bx
p}) is 2, therefore there are 2N − 4
22N
22N −4 = 16 degenerate ground states. The
independent stabilizers in the Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian has
ground sub-space of the Hamiltonian is the sub-space spanned by the states which are stabilized by all of the plaquette
operators simultaneously (Bx

p|gsi = |gsi) and one of these states can be represented as:

p } and {Bz

p |gsi = Bz

|gsi =Yp (cid:0)1 + Bx

p(cid:1) |0i⊗N ,

(4)

up to a normalization factor. To construct the other 15 ground states one needs to deﬁne the following logical
operators:

Z1 = Yi∈C1

σz,i, Z2 = Yi∈C2

σz,i, Z3 = Yi∈C3

σz,i, Z4 = Yi∈C4

σz,i,

(5)

σx,i, X2 = Yi∈C3

σx,i, X3 = Yi∈C2

σx,i, X4 = Yi∈C1

σx,i,

(6)

where C1, C2, C3 and C4 are four non-trivial loops in the torus in the sense that they can not be written as a tensor
product of some plaquette operators (ﬁgure 1). One should note that there are only two non-trivial loops for each
non-trivial homology cycles in a torus, the Blue loop and the Red loop; the third non-trivial loop (Green) can be
written as a tensor product of the red and the blue ones, i.e.

up to some plaquette operators. Using these logical operators, all of the 16 ground states can be represented as
follows:

CrCbCg ∼ 1,

CrCb ∼ Cg,

(7)

|i1, i2, i3, i4i = X i1

1 X i2

2 X i3

3 X i4

4 |gsi,

in = 0, 1.

(8)

The non-trivial loops can be represented in two ways as shown in ﬁgure 1. In ﬁgure 1a they turn around the torus
once, while in ﬁgure 1b they turn around three times (which is a function of the system size). One should note that
the two types of representing the loops are equivalent in the sense that one can deform the two representations into
each other by using a set of appropriate plaquette operators. The second representation (ﬁgure 1b) will be used in
section V.

In a realization of topological color code, information can be stored in the topologically degenerate ground states of
the system. One can use the ground states to encode 4 logical qubits. Due to its topological order, the model is robust
against local perturbations and the only perturbations that may cause logical error are those with a length equal to
the system size. Moreover the Cliﬀord group’s generators can be implemented by this model, which is suﬃcient for
doing quantum distillation of entanglement without any need to address single qubits and to braid the quasi-particles
[12, 18].

III. MARKOVIAN APPROXIMATION IN THE WEAK COUPLING LIMIT

Consider a quantum system which is not closed and is coupled to a thermal bath at temperature T . One can

attribute the following total Hamiltonian to the system and the bath, which form a closed system together:

H = H sys + H bath + H int,

H int =Xα

Sα ⊗ fα,

(9)

where, H sys is the Hamiltonian of the system that we want to study its stability and in our model has topological
order, H bath is the Hamiltonian of the bath that we do not have any knowledge of it and H int is the interaction
Hamiltonian of the system and bath. Sα’s are operators acting on the system and fα’s are operators acting on the
bath, and without loss of generality we can assume that they are hermitian [27].

In the weak coupling limit of the interaction Hamiltonian, an operator in the Heisenberg picture, evolves as follows

[27–30]:

dX
dt

= G(X) := i[H sys, X] + L(X).

(10)

Here G is the generator of the evolution, which consists of two parts. The ﬁrst part is the normal generator of the
evolution of closed quantum systems and the second one is the Lindblad generator or the dissipative part of the
evolution, due to existence of the bath. The latter can be given as:

Lα,ω(X)

L(X) =Xα Xω≥0
2Xα Xω≥0

=

1

hα(ω) S†

α(ω)[X, Sα(ω)] + [S†

α(ω), X]Sα(ω)

+ e−βωSα(ω)[X, S†

α(ω)] + e−βω[Sα(ω), X]S†

α(ω)!,

(11)

5

where the factors hα(ω)’s are the Fourier transforms of the auto-correlation functions of fα’s and we have used the
relations hα(−ω) = e−βωhα(ω). In addition Sα(ω) is the Fourier transform of Sα:

Sα(ω) = Xǫ−ǫ′=ω

Πǫ′ SαΠǫ,

(12)

where Πǫ is the projector to the sub-space with energy ǫ and ω’s are the Bohr frequencies of the system Hamiltonian.
One can further check that Sα(−ω) = S†

α(ω) and Pω Sα(ω) = Sα.

Properties of the Lindblad super-operator

In this section we brieﬂy review some of the essential features of the Lindblad super-operator, needed for our study:

• Self-adjointness of L : If we deﬁne the Liouville scalar product as follows:

the Lindblad super-operator is self-adjoint with respect to it, i.e:

hX, L(Y )iβ = hL(X), Y iβ.

hX, Y iβ := tr(ρβX †Y ),

(13)

(14)

From here on, in the rest of this paper by scalar product we mean the Liouville scalar product and we withdraw
writing β symbol.

• Positivity of −L : The Lindblad super-operator is negative which means that:

It has been proved in the appendix.

− hX, L(X)i ≥ 0,

∀X.

• Gap of −L: Because of the positivity of −L, its smallest eigenvalue diﬀerent from 0 is deﬁned as its gap:

Gap(−L) := min

X (cid:18) − hX, L(X)i : ∀X 6= I(cid:19).

(15)

(16)

IV. STABILITY AND INSTABILITY CONDITIONS FOR TOPOLOGICAL MEMORIES

• Stability: To prove the stability of a memory at ﬁnite temperature and its capability for coding the information,
one should ﬁnd an observable as the logical operator for the logical qubit such that by increasing the system
size the auto-correlation function of the observable does not decrease in time; more rigorously one should ﬁnd
an observable X and a decay rate ǫ, such that:

hX, X(t)i ≥ e−ǫthX, Xi,

(17)

where, ǫ is the decay rate of the auto-correlation function of the observable X, and in the case of a stable
memory the decay rate should decrease exponentially with the system size (ǫ = e−N a) and thus by increasing
the system size the decay rate goes to zero and the memory will be stable and self-correcting. By substituting
X(t) = etLX into equation 17, the condition for the stability recasts into the following:

− hX, L(X)i ≤ ǫ.

(18)

• Instability: To prove the instability of a memory one should prove that the auto-correlation function of all of
the observables with time, decreases faster than an exponential function, which means that for any observable
we have:

hX, X(t)i ≤ e−ǫthX, Xi.

(19)

By substituting X(t) = etLX into the above equation the instability condition of a memory recasts into the
following:

− hX, L(X)i ≥ ǫ,

(20)

which means that for proving the instability of a memory one should estimate a lower bound of −hX, L(X)i by
minimizing it over all of the observables. If this quantity is a constant independent of the system size or is a
variable of the system size that does not decrease with the size of the system, the memory is unstable. Since
in the ﬁnite time the auto-correlation goes to zero and the encoded information lost (for more details see [21, 31]).

Therefore proving the stability of a memory is nothing but estimating the gap of −L, which is denoted by G:

6

Applying equation A4, one ﬁnds that:

Gap(−L) := G = min

G ≥

h[Sα(ω), X], [Sα(ω), X]i(cid:19).

(21)

(22)

(23)

Moreover, by using equation 28 of reference [22] and the relationPω Sα(ω) = Sα, we obtain:

G ≥

(hα(ω)) min

α,ω

which is easier to estimate. One should note that hα(ω) is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function
of fα and it can be supposed that hα(ω) does not depend on α’s, which means that the action of the bath and
the strength of interaction Hamiltonian is uniform in the whole system. Thus the minimum of hα(ω) is equal to
e−β∆h(∆), where ∆ is the gap of the Hamiltonian and for TCC, ∆ is equal to 6J. Therefore the lower bound
of the gap recasts into the following:

G ≥

e−β∆h(∆) min

h[Sα, X], [Sα, X]i(cid:19).

V. THERMAL INSTABILITY OF THE TOPOLOGICAL COLOR CODE

Consider a realization of the topological color code, which is coupled to a thermal bath at temperature T . Due
to this coupling errors can be applied from the bath on the system. The errors usually do not commute with the
Hamiltonian and the system will not remain in the ground states anymore. If the system is able to correct itself, i.e.
it can remove errors to stay in the ground sub-space, it can be considered as a stable topological memory.

In the present work, thermal stability of TCC at ﬁnite temperature is studied. We assume that the interaction

Hamiltonian between the system and the bath is of the following form:

H int =Xi

(σx,i ⊗ fx,i + σz,i ⊗ fz,i) ,

(25)

which means that, σx and σz is applied from the bath, on each qubit. To understand the eﬀect of this Hamiltonian
on the system, consider the ith qubit, for example; σx,i (σz,i) anti-commutes with the three z type (x type) plaquette
operators that have this qubit in common. Thus if σx,i acts from the bath on the ground state, because of this
anti-commuting, the eigenvalues of the three paluettes operators become −1 and the system goes out of the ground
sub-space and consequently the code space.

We can assume that in a plaquette with −1 eigenvalue, an excitation (quasi-particle) has been created. In TCC
the excitations can move freely and cause logical errors. Therefore it seems that the model is not self correcting. By
having this intuition we present a rigorous proof of the instability of this model, i.e we shall estimate a lower bound
for the gap of the Lindblad super-operator corresponding to the model as it is discussed in the previous section.

A. Excitations

If the operators that are applied from the bath on the system do not commute with the Hamiltonian, they create
excitations. In this section we introduce the generators for having all possible excitations in TCC. In this model the
excitations appear in many diﬀerent ways and not necessarily in pairs; however, all of them can be generated by the
use of two kinds of generators:

Cr

Cg

Branching point (bx)

σx

Cb

σx ⊗ σx

7

Cb

Cr

bx

bz

Cg

q1

q2

q3

q4

FIG. 2. (Color Online): The open strings Cr, Cb, Cg and branching points bx, bz, for creating all kinds of excitations in TCC.

• Open strings: Corresponding to each color, there is a global open string as shown in ﬁgure 2b. The red global
open string, for example, is obtained by inserting a site at the center of every red plaquette and then connecting
the sites through the red links which have the same orientation[32](exactly as the Cr string shown in ﬁgure 2b).
Note that each link of the global strings corresponds to two nearest neighbor gubits in the original lattice. Let
us call the connected subsets of the global open strings as open strings.
As an example, consider an open string with only one link. By acting σx ⊗ σx or σz ⊗ σz on the two qubits that
lie on the only link of the string, the two plaquettes that are on the two ends of the string, will be excited (ﬁgure
2a). By Increasing the length of this string one can move the excitations to any other two red plaquettes.

In this case, excitations appear in pairs. In a lattice with N plaquettes and 2N qubits, to generate all of the
open string operators, 2N − 6 qubits are needed; these qubits are located on Cr, Cb and Cg global strings.

• Branching points: In TCC it is possible to have three excitations in three plaquettes with diﬀerent colors. It
is impossible to create such excitations by using the open strings; however by using a single-qubit operator along
with the open string operators, one can have all kinds of excitations. More rigorously, by acting σx on one qubit,
which we call branching point, excitations are created in the three plaquettes that have this qubit in common
[33]. By using open strings one can move the excitations from these three plaquettes to other plaquettes with
the same color.

One should note that because of the relation 3, arbitrary number of excitations for diﬀerent colors are not
allowed and there are certain constraints on the number of excitations of diﬀerent colors. For example, a single
excitation with red color is not allowed.

Therefore, all kinds of excitations can be generated by applying σx ⊗ σx or σz ⊗ σz on the qubits that belong to the
open strings and also σx and σz on the branching points bx and bz respectively.

In a hexagonal lattice with 2N qubits, to generate all kinds of excitations one needs 2N − 6 + 2 = 2N − 4 qubits.
Thus four qubits are left (q1, q2, q3 and q4 shown in ﬁgure 2b). This is consistent with having 16 degenerate ground
states and 4 logical qubits.

B. Observables

For each Hamiltonian all of the observables can be generated by σx and σz on each qubit. Therefore the algebra of

the observables for a system consists of N qubits is as follows:

O = Q1 ⊗ Q2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ QN ,

(26)

where, Qi is the algebra of the observables of the ith qubit which is generated by σx,i and σz,i. However, one can
construct all of the observables in another way by the use of the operators deﬁned in the Hamiltonian and the logical
operators and also the generators needed to create all kinds of excitations. In the case of TCC the generators of the
algebra of the observable are of three types:

8

• The x and z type plaquette operators in the Hamiltonian, Bx

p , Bz

p operators.

• The logical operators deﬁned in equations 5 and 6 [34].

• σx ⊗ σx or σz ⊗ σz acting on two nearest neighbor qubits that lie on Cr, Cb and Cg strings (ﬁgure 2).

• σx acting on bx and σz acting on bz.

C. The Gap of generator of the topological color code

In this section, as a proof for thermal instability of the TCC, we estimate a lower bound of the gap of generator
of the evolution, due to the coupling to the thermal bath, and show that it is a constant independent of the system
size. To this end we refer to equation 24 which for the interaction Hamiltonian deﬁned in equation 25 recasts into the
following:

G ≥

1
2

e−β∆h(∆) min

Γ (cid:18)Xi

h[σx,i, Γ], [σx,i, Γ]i + h[σz,i, Γ], [σz,i, Γ]i(cid:19).

(27)

where minimization is over all of the observables. But if one wants an observable to be a logical observable acting on
the code space it should commute with the Hamiltonian. Therefore we don not need to do the minimization over all
of the observables on Hilbert space explained in previous section; but only over the observables that commute with
the Hamiltonian. The logical observables Z and X for one qubit also should anti-commute and square to identity.
Therefore the most general form of the observables that we have to do minimization over them to be regarded as Z
or X logical operator for one qubit are as follows:

O = Z µ1

1 X ν1

1 ⊗ Z µ2

2 X ν2

2 ⊗ Z µ3

3 X ν3

3 ⊗ Z µ4

4 X ν4

4 ⊗ Bz

p ⊗ Bx
p ,

(28)

p and Bx

where Bz
minimization is over diﬀerent possibilities of µi’s and νi’s and also the two algebras Bx
above equation for Γ into equation 27 one ﬁnds that:

p are the algebras generated by all of the z and x type plaquette operators respectively and the
p . By substituting the

p and Bx

G ≥

e−β∆h(∆) min

Γz (cid:0)Xi

h[σx,i, Γz], [σx,i, Γz]i(cid:1) + min

Here by Γz we mean an operator belongs to the following sub-algebra:
3 ⊗ Z µ4

O‡ = Z µ1

1 ⊗ Z µ2

2 ⊗ Z µ3

4 ⊗ Bz
p,

and by Γx we mean an operator belongs to the following sub-algebra:

O§ = X ν1

1 ⊗ X ν2

2 ⊗ X ν3

3 ⊗ X ν4

4 ⊗ Bx
p .

Therefore we have:

G ≥

2

(gx + gz).

h[σz,i, Γx], [σz,i, Γx]i(cid:1)! .

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

Here, gx, comes from σx part of the interaction Hamiltonian and gz, comes from σz part of the interaction Hamiltonian
and are equal to:

and

gx = e−β∆h(∆) min

gz = e−β∆h(∆) min

Γz (cid:18)Xi
Γx (cid:18)Xi

h[σx,i, Γz], [σx,i, Γz]i(cid:19),

h[σz,i, Γx], [σz,i, Γx]i(cid:19).

(33)

(34)

By symmetry we know that gx and gz are equal to each other. Thus, the lower bound of the gap reduces to G ≥ gx,
i.e:

G ≥ e−β∆h(∆) min

Γz (cid:18)Xi

h[σx,i, Γz], [σx,i, Γz]i(cid:19).

(35)

To estimate a lower bound of the gap one can partition the algebra of all of the observables into diﬀerent sectors
(diﬀerent possibilities of µi’s) and obtain a lower bound of each sector and at the end do the minimization over all of
the sectors.

p or Γz = Z2Bz

Let us show the minimum of the decay rate in this sector by G1. By symmetry we know that the eﬀect of the

p is exactly the same as its eﬀect on Z2Bz

(36)

From now on to the end of this section, we use the notation used in [21], and show the terms h[σx,i, Z1Bz
as L1

x,i. Therefore, we have:

where by L1

each term Lx,i, which is proved in Appendix A. Now we calculate the terms Lx,Cb, Lx,Cg and Lx,Cr separately as
follows:

we mean Pi∈Cb

where the second line is the consequence of this fact that Z1 commutes with all of σx,i, i ∈ Cb (ﬁgure 1b and ﬁgure
2b), because the support of Z1 and Cb do not have any common qubit.

x,Cr

One can further check that the same arguments as above also hold for L1

x,Cg . The only term that is diﬀerent is
L1
. Since the support of Z1 and Cr meet each other and therefore Z1 does not commute with σx,i’s, i ∈ Cr.
However, as shown in equation 7 in TCC a non-trivial loop with a speciﬁc color, say red, is equivalent to the tensor
product of two other non-trivial loops that have diﬀerent colors, green and blue, but are in the same homology class
as the red one. Therefore one can write Z1, (shown as Zr) as the tensor product of Z2 (shown as Zb) and another
logical operator that is deﬁned on a green non-trivial loop (shown as Zg), i.e.:

up to some plaquette operators. Thus:

(41)

(42)

Here, the minimization is only over Bz
p algebra and from the bath some σx operators are applied on the qubits that
lie on Cb. Obtaining the gap of this new model is much more easier, because by knowing the eﬀect of the bath on
this new model one can map it to a known model that its Lindblad gap is known. The new model is nothing but
the Ising model. The reason is that in TCC when σx is applied on one qubit, say qubit number 1 in ﬁgure 3a, it can
create three excitations in three plaquettes that have this qubit in common, by acting another σx on the next qubit,
qubit number 2, two of these excitations will be annihilated and a new one can be created in the next blue plaquette
(ﬁgure 3a). On the other hand consider another model, one dimensional Ising model with in-homogeneous couplings
as follows:

HIsing = −J Xi=odd

σz,iσz,i+1 − 2J Xi=even

σz,iσz,i+1.

(43)

In this model if σx be applied on qubit number 1 in ﬁgure 3b, it excites two of the bonds, however since one of
the coupling strength is twice the other one, one can suppose that this external perturbation creates three excitations
with the same energy (the excited bonds are shown with red color in ﬁgure 3b). By applying another σx on qubit
number 2 the bond with two excitations is not excited any more, but another bond with one excitation can be excited.
Thus the process of creation and annihilation of excitation in the TCC is exactly what happens in the Ising model
deﬁned in equation 43. It has been shown in [21] that the Ising model with random coupling is not a stable memory
against thermal ﬂuctuations, since the gap of Lindblad super-operator for this model is a constant independent of
the system size. Therefore one can conclude that for this sector of observables, the minimum of the decay rate is the
following constant, which is independent of the system size:

G1 ≥ 3e−β∆h(∆)(Gap(L))Ising.

2. The sector of Γz = Bz

Let us show the minimum of the decay rate in this sector by G2:

G2 ≥ e−β∆h(∆) min

Γz (cid:18)Xi

h[σx,i, Bz

p], [σx,i, Bz

p]i(cid:19).

As previous case the terms like h[σx,i, Bz

p], [σx,i, Bz

p]i are shown as L2

x,i. Therefore, we have:

Xi

h[σx,i, Bz

p], [σx,i, Bz

By symmetry we know that the three terms L2
decay rate recasts into the following form:

(47)

which is exactly what was discussed in previous section and was equal to the gap of Linddblad super-operator for the
Ising model deﬁned in equation 43. Therefore, we have:

G2 ≥ 3e−β∆h(∆)(Gap(L))Ising.

(48)

3. The sector of Γz = Z3Bz

p or Γz = Z4Bz

p

Let us show the minimum of the decay rate in this sector by G3. By symmetry we know that the eﬀect of the
p. Therefore it is enough to consider only

external bath on Z3Bz
p is exactly the same as the eﬀect of the bath on Z4Bz
one of them, say Z3Bz
p:

G3 ≥ e−β∆h(∆) min

Γz (cid:18)Xi

In this sector the terms like h[σx,i, Z3Bz

p], [σx,i, Z3Bz

p]i are represented by L3

x,i. Therefore we have:

Now we calculate the terms separately as follows:

Γz

L3

x,Cr = min

Γz (cid:18) Xi∈Cr

h[σx,i, Z3Bz

p], [σx,i, Z3Bz

p]i(cid:19).

Since Z3’s support is the closed red string and Cr is also a red string, but in the other homological class, they do not
meet each other at any point. Thus Z3 and σx,i, i ∈ Cr commute with each other and above equation reduces to:

min
Γz

L3

x,Cr = min

Γz (cid:18) Xi∈Cr

h[σx,i, Bz

p]i(cid:19),

(53)

which is exactly what was discussed in the ﬁrst case, and is equal to the gap of the Lindblad super-operator for the
Ising model deﬁned in equation 43. The only thing that remains to obtain is Lx,Cb and Lx,Cg , which by symmetry
we know that they are equal to each other. Thus it is enough to consider only one of them:

h[σx,i, Z3Bz

p], [σx,i, Z3Bz

p]i(cid:19).

(55)

Using Lemma 2 in [21] which indicates that a lower bound of the gap of a super-operator like S that can be written
as summation of two other super-operators, i.e. S = A + B, is given by:

Gap(S) ≥

Gap(A)hker(A), B(ker(A))i

Gap(A) + ||B||

.

(56)

In our model, A is the Lindblad super-operator when the bath does not have any eﬀect on the qubits lying on C3 and
B is when the bath is applied only on the qubits lying on C3. Therefore for the gap of A we have:

12

Gap(A) = min

Γz (cid:18) Xi∈Cb,i /∈Z3
Γz (cid:18) Xi∈Cb,i /∈Z3

= min

h[σx,i, Z3Bz

p], [σx,i, Z3Bz

p]i(cid:19)

h[σx,i, Bz

p], [σx,i, Bz

p]i(cid:19).

(57)

To obtain the last line one should note that it is not the gap of Ising model, because the bath is not applying on all
of the qubits lying on C3, however it is like a one-dimensional Ising model which has been cut in some points. The
number of these points is |C|
2 GapIsing. where
|C| is the length of C3.

2 . Therefore a lower bound of the gap of super-operator A is equal to |C|

In order to determine ker(A) one should note that it is an operator such that A(ker(A) = 0. From equation 11 it
is obvious that if σx,i’s applied from the bath commutes with X operator L(X) = 0. It is obvious that Z3 commutes
with all of σx,i, i /∈ Z3, thus ker(A) = Z3 and one ﬁnds that:

hker(A), B(ker(A))i = hZ3, B(Z3)i = Xi∈Cb,i∈Z3

h[σx,i, Z3], [σx,i, Z3]i.

By substituting [σx,i, Z3] = 2σx,iZ3 in the above equation we end in the following:

hZ3, B(Z3)i = Xi∈Cb,i∈Z3

4tr(ρβZ3σx,iσx,iZ3) = 2|C|.

(58)

(59)

The only term that remains to obtain is k B k which is the norm of the super-operator B and the inequality k B k≤ |C|
2
holds for it.

Gathering above results one ﬁnds the following lower bound for the gap of Lx,Cb in the present sector:

L3

x,Cb ≥

1
2 |C|GapIsing2|C|
2 |C|GapIsing + |C|

.

Therefore the minimum of the decay rate for this sector is given by:

G3 ≥ e−β∆h(∆)(cid:18)4|C|

GapIsing

GapIsing + 1

+ GapIsing(cid:19).

4. The sector of Γz = Z1Z3Bz

p or Γz = Z1Z4Bz

p or Γz = Z2Z3Bz

p or Γz = Z2Z4Bz

The minimum of the decay rate in this sector is shown by G4. Using the inequality 41 and the notation L4

Cb,g,r

=

(62)

(63)

Pi∈Cb,g,r

h[σx,i, Z1Z3Bz

Γz

Now we calculate the terms L4

where the second line is the consequence of commutativity of Z1 with all of σx,i, i ∈ Cb. In addition as we proved in
previous case a lower bound of this quantity is given by equation 60 and by symmetry it is equal to the lower bound
of L4

. The only term that remains to obtain is L4

GapIsing

+ GapIsing(cid:19).

(65)

To estimate the gap of L it is enough to consider only above sectors of the observables. Since it is straightforward to
check that all of the other sectors can be represented as one of four mentioned cases. Therefore the minimum of the
decay rate in all of the sectors can be obtained by doing minimization only over these four sectors. Therefore:

Theorem 1. The gap of Lindblad super-operator for topological color code due to the coupling to the thermal bath is
given by:

(Gap(L))TCC ≥ 3e−β∆h(∆)(Gap(L))Ising.

(66)

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have studied thermal stability of the Topological Color Code in presence of a thermal bath of the
form 25. To this end, we have studied the Lindblad evolution of the observables in the Hisenberg picture, and their
auto-correlation functions. The observables that we studied, commute with the Hamiltonian in order to be regarded
as logical operators acting on the code space. We obtain a lower bound of the decay rate of these observables as
follows:

where

hX, X(t)i ≤ e−ǫthX, Xi,

ǫ ≥ 3e−β∆h(∆)(Gap(L))Ising,

(67)

(68)

(Gap(L))Ising turns out to be a constant independent of the system size [21] and ∆ is the gap of the TCC model
which is equal to 6J. Our result means that the auto-correlation function of the observables decreases exponentially
in time faster than an exponential with a constant decay rate independent of the system size, i.e. by increasing the
system size one cannot decrease the decay rate to make the memory stable. Thus in a ﬁnite time the auto-correlation
function becomes very small and the encoded information will be lost. Therefore we can conclude that the Topological
Color Code is unstable against thermal ﬂuctuations from the bath at ﬁnite temperature, even though it is stable at
T=0 against local quantum perturbations.

Although the conclusion about the thermal instability of the color code is the same as for the Kitaev code, notice
however that the derivation of this new result is very diﬀerent in the case of color codes than for Kitaev model. For
example creating all possible excitations, with the open strings and the branching points deﬁned in Sec. V A, in the
TCC is diﬀerent from the Kitaev model; in which the excitations are created by the use of the snake and the comb
[21]. The generators needed for generating all observables, is the other point of diﬀerence; for the Color Code these
generators are introduced in Sec. V B, which are totally diﬀerent from the generators needed in the case of Kitaev
[21]. The last point of diﬀerence is that the process of creation of the excitations by the inﬂuence of the external
bath in the TCC, can be mapped to the in-homogeneous one-dimensional Ising model, in contrast to the case of the

Kitaev model which can be mapped to the one-dimensional homogeneous Ising model[21].

The impact of these results goes beyond the ﬁeld of quantum computation and extends to the new emerging ﬁeld
In fact, it is known that two-body
of topological orders in condensed matter system (strongly correlated spins).
Hamiltonians in 2D lattices can give rise to topological color codes in the low-energy sector for certain regimes of the
couplings [35, 36]. These topological orders are expected to suﬀer from thermal instabilities also.

Appendix A: Negativity of Lindblad super-operator

Lemma 2. The Lindblad super-operator is negative which means that:

− hX, L(X)i ≥ 0,

∀X.

Proof. In order to prove the positivity of −hX, L(X)i we use the deﬁnition of L(X):

− L(X) = −Xα Xω≥0
2Xα Xω≥0

=

1

Lα,ω(X)

hα(ω) S†

α(ω)[Sα(ω), X] + [X, S†

α(ω)]Sα(ω)

+ e−βωSα(ω)[S†

α(ω), X] + e−βω[X, Sα(ω)]S†

α(ω)!.

where we can forget about 1

2 hα(ω)’s and prove the positivity of each term −hX, Lα,ω(X)i, which is equal to:
− hX, Lα,ω(X)i = hX, S†

α(ω)[Sα(ω), X] + [X, S†

+ e−βωhX, Sα(ω)[S†

α(ω)]Sα(ω)i
α(ω), X] + [X, Sα(ω)]S†

α(ω)i.

Expanding the above equation and using the relation ρβSα(ω) = eβωSα(ω)ρβ, one can ﬁnds that:

− hX, Lα,ω(X)i = h[Sα(ω), X], [Sα(ω), X]i + e−βωh[S†

α(ω), X], [S†

α(ω), X]i.

(A1)

(A2)

(A3)

(A4)

In order to prove the positivity of h[Sα(ω), X], [Sα(ω), X]i one needs to use the explicit form of Sα(ω), which for x
type errors are as follows:

• Annihilation of three excitations: If there are three excitations in the three plaquettes that have this qubit

in common, σx,i annihilates all of them (ﬁgure 4a). Thus the Fourier transform of σx,i is given by:

Sx,i(ω = 6J) = Π−3J σx,iΠ3J =

1
8

σx,i(1 − Bz

p)(1 − Bz

p′ )(1 − Bz

p′′ ).

(A5)

Here, p, p′ and p′′ are the three plaquettes that have the ith qubit in common and Π3J denotes the projector
onto the sub-space with three excitations and Π−3J denotes the projector onto the sub-space with no excitation
in these three plaquettes.

• Creation of one excitation and annihilation of two: If there are two excitations in two of the plaquettes
that have this qubit in common, σx,i annihilates them and creates one excitation in the other plaquette (ﬁgure
4b). Thus the Fourier transform of σx,i is given by:

15

Sx,i(ω = 2J) = Π−J σx,iΠJ =

1
8

σx,i(cid:18)(1 − Bz

p)(1 − Bz

p′ )(1 + Bz

p′′ )

+(1 − Bz

p)(1 + Bz

p′ )(1 − Bz

p′′ ) + (1 + Bz

p )(1 − Bz

p′ )(1 − Bz

(A6)

p′′ )(cid:19).

Here, ΠJ denotes the projector onto the sub-space with two excitations and Π−J denotes the projector onto the
sub-space with one excitation.

Therefore we have:

Sx,i(6J) = σx,iΠ3J ,

Sx,i(2J) = σx,iΠJ ,

S†
x,i(6J) = σx,iΠ−3J ,
S†
x,i(2J) = σx,iΠ−J .

(A7)

All of the above arguments can be done in a similar fashion for the z type error by substituting σz,i for σx,i and Bx
P
for Bz
p.

It is enough to prove the positivity of h[Sα(ω), X], [Sα(ω), X]i for a speciﬁc ω, say 6J. For the other ω’s the

procedure is the same. For this case h[Sα(ω), X], [Sα(ω), X]i is equal to the following:

tr(cid:18)ρβΠ3J [X, σx,i][σx,i, X]Π3J(cid:19) = tr(cid:18)Π3J ρβ [X, σx,i]
| {z }A†

[σx,i, X]

| {z }A

(cid:19).

Since Π3J is a projector onto a sub-space of the system’s Hilbert space it can be written as:

The thermal state (ρβ) also can be written as the mixture of eigenstates of Hamiltonian, i.e.:

Π3J =Xm

|ΨmihΨm|.

Therefore we have:

ρβ =Xk

λk|ΨkihΨk|.

Π3J ρβ =Xm

λm|ΨmihΨm|.

(A8)

(A9)

(A10)

(A11)

If we diagonalize matrix A and expand the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian as a superposition of the eigenstates of A,
i.e.

we will end in the following:

which is clearly positive.

|Ψmi =Xa

ψm,a|Ψm,ai,

tr(cid:18)ρβΠ3J [X, σx,i][σx,i, X]Π3j(cid:19) =Xm,a

λm|ψm,a|2,

(A12)

(A13)

These arguments are not particular for TCC. For the other models ω’s and Π’s are diﬀerent, nevertheless the

procedure of the proof is as the same as above.

[32] One should note that the red links have 3 distinct orientations as shown in ﬁgure 1, but only the links with one speciﬁc

orientation are suﬃcient here.

[33] In order for the genarators to commute with each other we take two distinct branching points for the two types x and z.

The branching points are shown as bx and bz in ﬁgure 2b

[34] Zi and Xi operators are deﬁned on the non-trivial loops shown in ﬁgure 1b.
