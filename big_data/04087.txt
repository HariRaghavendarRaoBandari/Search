AUTOMORPHISMS OF SINGULAR

THREE-DIMENSIONAL CUBIC HYPERSURFACES

AVILOV A.A.

Abstract. In this paper we classify three-dimensional G-del Pezzo
varieties of degree 3, which are not G-rational and have no bira-
tional structure of G-Mori ﬁber space with the base of positive
dimension.

1. Introduction

In this paper we work over an angebraically closed ﬁeld k of char-
acteristic 0. Recall that a G-variety is a pair (X, ρ), where X is an
algebraic variety and ρ : G → Aut(X) is an injective homomorphism
of groups. We say that G-variety X has GQ-factorial singularities if
every G-invariant Weil divisor of X is Q-Cartier.

Let X be a G-variety with at most GQ-factorial terminal singularities
and π : X → Y be a G-equivariant morphism. We call π a G-Mori
ﬁbration if π∗OX = OY , dim X > dim Y , the relative invariant Picard
number ρG(X/Y ) is equal to 1 (in this case we say that G is minimal )
and the anticanonical class −KX is π-ample. If Y is a point then X is
a GQ-Fano variety. If in addition the anticanonical class is a Cartier
divisor then X is a G-Fano variety.

Let X be arbitrary normal projective G-variety of dimension 3. Re-
solving the singularities of X and applying the G-equivariant minimal
model program we reduce X either to a G-variety with nef anticanoni-
cal class, or to a G-Mori ﬁbration (see e.g. [18, §3]). So such ﬁbrations
(and GQ-Fano varieties in particular) form a very important class in
the birational classiﬁcation. In this paper we consider a certain class
of G-Fano threefolds.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A projective n-dimensional variety X is a del Pezzo
variety if it has at most terminal Gorenstien singularities and the an-
ticanonical class −KX is ample and divisible by n − 1 in the Picard
group Pic(X). If a G-Fano variety X is a del Pezzo variety, then we
say that X is a G-del Pezzo variety.

Del Pezzo varieties of arbitrary dimension were classiﬁed by T. Fujita
([14], [13], [15]). Three-dimensional G-del Pezzo varieties were partially
classiﬁed by Yu. Prokhorov in [20]. The main invariant of a del Pezzo
threefold X is the degree d = (− 1
2 KX)3, it is an integer in the interval
from 1 to 8. In this paper we consider the case d = 3. In this case X
is a cubic hypersurface in P4. The case d = 4 was considered in our
previous work [2]. If d > 4 then X is smooth (cf. [20]) while smooth del
Pezzo threefolds and their automorphism groups are known well. For
other types of G-Fano threefolds there are only some partial results:
see for example [22], [25].

Classiﬁcation of ﬁnite subgroups of the Cremona group Cr3(k) is
one of the motivations of this paper. The Cremona group Crn(k) is the
group of birational automorphisms of the projective space Pn
k. Finite
subgroups of Cr2(k) were completely classiﬁed by I. Dolgachev and V.
Iskovskikh in [11]. The core of their method is the following. Let G
be a ﬁnite subgroup of Cr2(k). The action of G can be regularized
in the following sence: there exists a smooth projective G-variety Z
and an equivariat birational morphism Z → P2. Then we apply the
equivariant minimal model program to Z and obtain a G-Mori ﬁbra-
tion which is either a G-conic bundle over P1 (which is a blowing up
of a Hirzebruch surface in some points), or a G-minimal del Pezzo
surface. Dolgachev and Iskovskikh classiﬁed all minimal subgroups in
automorphism groups of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles and so
they obtained the full list of ﬁnite subgroups of Cr2(k). But quite often
two subgroups from such list are conjugate in Cr2(k), so it is natural
to identify them. One can see that G-varieties Z1 and Z2 give us con-
jugate subgroups if and only if there exists a G-equivariant birational
map Z1 99K Z2. So we need to classify all rational G-Mori ﬁbrations
and birational maps between them as well.

Following this program in the three-dimemsional case one can re-
duce the question of classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite subgroups in Cr3(k) to
the question of classiﬁcation of all rational GQ-Mori ﬁbrations and bi-
rational equivariant maps between them. Such program was realized
in some particular cases: simple non-abelian subgroups (see [24], see
also [6], [7], [8], [5]) and p-elementary subgroups of Cr3(C) (see [23], [19]).
For applications to Cremona groups we are mostly interested in clas-
siﬁcation of rational del Pezzo varieties, so we assume that X is singular
(every smooth cubic threefold is not rational due to the classical result
of Clemens and Griﬃths [9]). Singular cubic threefolds whose singular-
ities are nodes were classiﬁed by H. Finkelnberg and J. Werner in [12].
They have described the mutual arrangement of singular points and
planes, divisorial class groups and small resolutions of such varieties.

2

Following their paper [12], we will use the notation J1–J15 for nodal
cubic threefolds everywhere below.

In this paper we are interested in the following problem: classify
rational G-del Pezzo threefolds of degree 3 that have no G-equivariant
birational map to a “more simple” G-Fano threefold (for example P3
or a quadric in P4) or to a G-Mori ﬁbration with the base of positive
dimension. In this paper we give a partial answer for this question.

In this paper we use the following notation:

• Cn is the cyclic group of order n;
• D2n is the dihedral group of order 2n;
• Sn is the symmetric group of degree n;
• An is the alternating group of degree n;
• Gn is the direct sum of n copies of the group G;
• (a1, a2, ..., an1)(an1+1, ..., an2)...(anm−1+1, ..., anm) is a cyclic de-

composition of an element σ ∈ SN ;

• S5 ⊂ S6 is a standard subgroup iﬀ it is the stabilizer of some
element in {1, ..., 6} with the natural action of S6, and non-
standard otherwise. We use the same notation for A5 ⊂ S6;
j is the Kronecker symbol: δi
wise.

j = 1 if i = j and δi

j = 0 other-

• δi

Deﬁnition 1.2. We call a group G ⊂ Aut(X) linearizable (resp., of
ﬁber type) if there exists a G-equivariant birational map X 99K P3
(resp., X 99K X ′ where X ′ has a structure of a G-Mori ﬁbration with
the base of positive dimension).

The main result of this paper is the following theorem:

Theorem 1.3. Let X = X3 ⊂ P4 be a cubic hypersurface and G be
a ﬁnite subgroup of Aut(X) such that X is a rational G-Fano variety.
Suppose that G is neither linearizable nor of ﬁber type. Then all sin-
gularities of X are ordinary double points (nodes) and X is described
in the following table:

Conversely, for any group G in the table above (X, G) is a G-Fano
variety.

Remark 1.4. We do not state that all G-varieties from the table ac-
tually are not linearizable or not of ﬁber type. It requires much more
detailed analysis of G-birational rigidity of every case separately.

2. Singularities of three-dimensional cubic hypersurfaces

Assumption 2.1. Throughtout this paper X is a singular cubic hyper-
surface in P4 with only terminal singularities and G is a ﬁnite subgroup
of Aut(X) such that G is minimal and is neither linearizable nor of ﬁber
type (so Aut(X) also has such properties).

Remark 2.2. Since X is GQ-factorial, the G-minimality of X is equiv-
alent to rk Cl(X)G = 1.

Since the Picard group Pic(X) is generated by the class of a hyper-
plane section (see [16, Corollary 4.3.2]), the action of G on X is induced
from a linear action of G on P4.

Lemma 2.3. Let Y be a three-dimensional G-variety and let Z be a G-
variety of dimension 1 or 2. Let Y 99K Z be a G-equivariant dominant
rational map whose general ﬁber is either a rational curve or rational
surface. Then there exists the following commutative diagram

(1)

Y

/❴❴❴

Y ′

Z

Z ′

where Y ′ → Z ′ is a G-Mori ﬁber space and both horizontal maps are
birational and G-equivariant.

Proof. Note that one can equivariantly compactify a G-variety S by
compactifying the quotient S/G and taking its normalization in the
function ﬁeld k(S). Then we may assume that Y and Z are projective.
Then we can apply equivariant resolution of singularities (see [1]). So
we may assume that Y 99K Z is a G-equivariant morphism between
smooth projective varieties. Then we apply the G-equivariant relative
minimal model program to Y over Z. Since ﬁbers of the map Y → Z
are rationally connected, in the end we obtain a required G-Mori ﬁbra-
tion Y ′ → Z ′. This gives us the required commutative diagram.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.4. In the case where Y 99K Z is of relative dimension
one the commutative diagram (1) can be taken so that Y ′ and Z ′ are
smooth varieties (see [3] for details).

The following easy lemma is very important:

Lemma 2.5.

(i) The variety X has no G-ﬁxed singular points

and no G-invariant lines;

(ii) There are no G-invariant planes in P4.

Proof. If X contains a ﬁxed singular point then the projection from
this point is a G-equivariant birational map to P3. Therefore G is
linearizable in this case. If X contains a G-invariant line then the pro-
jection from this line gives us a G-equivariant rational curve ﬁbration,
and in the case of G-invariant plane we get a G-ﬁbration by quadric
or cubic surfaces in P3 (the ﬁrst case occurs exactly when the plane
lies on X). Then we apply Lemma 2.3. Therefore G is of ﬁber type in
these cases.
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.6. The G-orbit of a singular point of X has length at
least 4.

Deﬁnition 2.7. We say that points p1, ..., pk ∈ Pn are in general posi-
tion if no d of them lie in a subspace Pd−2 ⊂ Pn for every d ≤ n + 1.

The following facts about singular points of cubic threefolds are well-

known.

Lemma 2.8. Let Y ⊂ P4 be an arbitrary cubic hypersurface with iso-
lated singularities. Then

(i) no three singular points lie on one line;
(ii) if four singular points lie on a plane then this plane is contained

in Y and there is no other singular points on it;

(iii) if no four singular points lie on a plane then all singular points

of Y are in general position.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement can be easily deduced from the fact that the
singular set of X is an intersection of quadrics.

Assume that four singular points of Y lie on a plane P . Suppose that
P is not contained in Y . Then Y ∩P is a cubic curve with four singular
points such that no three of them lie on one line. It is impossible, so
P lies on Y . The second part of (ii) also follows from the fact that the
singular set of X is an intersection of quadrics.

Let H be a hyperplane such that it contains at least ﬁve singular
points of Y and no four of them lie on a plane. Consider the intersection
Z = Y ∩ H. It is a cubic surface with at least ﬁve singular points. Due
to [4] such a surface must be reducible. If Z is a union of a quadric
and a plane, then at least four singular points lie on this plane. If Z
is a union of three diﬀerent planes then all singular points lie on three
lines (each line is the intersection of two planes). Thus in this case we
again see, that one of three planes contains four singular points of Y .
If Z contains a double or triple plane, then such plane is the singular
set of Z, so it contains ﬁve singular points of Y . This contradiction
proves (iii).

there is one of the following possibilities:

where s(X) is the number of nodes, p(X) is the number of planes on
X and r(X) is the rank of Cl(X).

Proof. Cases J1–J3 of [12] are impossible because X has at least four
singular points by Corollary 2.6. If X is of type J6, J7 or J8, then X
contains exactly one plane, which is Aut(X)-invariant. If X is of type
J10 or J12, then there is a distinguished Aut(X)-invariant singular
point of X (p7 more presicely).
If X is of type J13, then there is
a distinguished quadruple of singular points p5, p6, p7, p8 which lie on
one Aut(X)-invariant plane. Hence in all these cases we can apply
Lemma 2.5 to obtain a contradiction. Numbers s(X), p(X) and r(X)
can be found in [12].
(cid:3)

Now we consider the case where not all the singularities of X are

nodes.

Proposition 2.10. Assume that X contains a singularity which is not
a node. Then the variety X has exactly four or ﬁve singularities of type
cA1 or cA2 in general position and no other singularities.

Proof. We have the following formula for the degree of the dual variety:

deg X ∨ = 3 · 23 − Xp∈Sing(X)

m(p),

where m(p) = µ(p) + µ′(p) is the sum of Milnor numbers of singularity
(X, p) and its hyperplane section (see [28] for details). Obviously, we
have deg X ∨ ≥ 3, hence

Xp∈Sing(X)

m(p) ≤ 21.

Note that three-dimensional terminal hypersurface singularities are ex-
actly cDV points (see [17, Corollary 5.38]). If p is a cDV singularity
which is not of type cA1, then µ(p) ≥ 2 and µ′(p) ≥ 2 (one can see
it easily from the deﬁnition of Milnor number), and equalities hold
exactly for cA2 singularities. Thus singularities are of type cA2 and
we have four or ﬁve of them. The number of remaining singularities

7

cannot be greater than 21−4·4
on X.

2 = 5

2, so there are no other singularities

Assume that all singularities of X are cA1 points. In some analytic

neighbourhood they can be given by an equation x2+y2+z2+tn = 0, n > 1.
Hence they are rs-nondegenerate (see [20, Deﬁnition 10.1, Proposition
10.3]). On the other hand, r(X) = rk Cl(X) ≤ 3 by [20, Theorems
1.7, 7.1 and 8.1]. Thus we can apply the following formula (see [20,
Proposition 10.6]):

where X ′ is a general smooth cubic, ρ(X) is the Picard number of X,

(2) Xp∈Sing(X)
λ(X, p) ≤ r(X) − ρ(X) + h1,2(X ′) − h1,2(bX) ≤ 7,
variety bX is a standard resolution of X (see [20, Deﬁnition 10.1]) and
λ(X, p) is the number of exceptional divisors of bX → X over p.

It
follows from (2) and Corollary 2.6 that all singular points lie in one
Aut(X)-orbit and λ(X, p) = 1 for every singular point p. By the direct
computations one can easily see that λ(X, p) = 1 iﬀ n ≤ 3. Hence
n = 3. Assume that the number of singular points is greater than 5.
Then r(X) ≥ 2 by the formula (2) and X is not Q-factorial. But the
singularity x2 + y2 + z2 + t3 = 0 is Q-factorial (see [26, Corollary 1.16]),
a contradiction. Thus the number of cA1 points which are not nodes
cannot be greater than 5.

As an easy consequence from the Lemma 2.8, all singular points are
(cid:3)

in general position.

Remark 2.11. Later we will show (see §7 and §8) that two cases from
the statement of the Proposition 2.10 cannot occur.

3. Segre cubic

In this section we consider the case where X is a cubic hypersurface
in P4 of type J15 satisfying Assumption 2.1 and G is the corresponding
minimal subgroup of Aut(X). Such a variety is unique up to isomor-
phism.
It is called Segre cubic and can be explicitly given by the
following system of equations:

xi =

x3
i = 0

5Xi=0

5Xi=0

in P5. This variety has many interesting properties (see e.g. [10, §9.4.4]):
• This is a unique cubic threefold with ten isolated singularities.
• The automorphism group of X is isomorphic to S6 and acts

on X via permutation of coordinates.

8

• The variety X contains exactly 15 planes forming an Aut(X)-

orbit and one of them is given by equations

x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0.

• Singular points of X form an Aut(X)-orbit, one of them has

coordinates (1 : 1 : 1 : −1 : −1 : −1).

Proposition 3.1. The group G coincides with one of the following
subgroups of Aut(X) ≃ S6:

where S5 and A5 are standard subgroups.

A5, S5, A6, S6,

Proof. One can easily prove this using the list of all subgroups of S6 (for
example, one can use GAP [29] to construct such a list) and following
simple facts:

• The group G with the natural action on the set of coordinates
cannot have an invariant pair of coordinates: otherwise there
is a G-invariant plane in P4.

• The group G is not a subgroup of S2

3 ⋊ C2 ⊂ Aut(X) since
such group is a stabilizer of some singular point of X (see [21,
p. 252]).

• Every subgroup S5 ⊂ Aut(X) acting transitively on the set
of coordinates has an orbit of length 5 in the set of planes in
X (see [21, Lemma 3.8]). The sum of all planes in such orbit
cannot be proportional to the canonical class of X. Hence such
subgroups S5 are not minimal. As a consequence, G is not a
subgroup of such group.

• Every subgroup H ≃ S4 × C2 acting transitively on the set of
coordinates is the stabilizer of some plane on X since all such
subgroups are conjugate and the stabilizer of a plane has the
same property. As a consequence, G is not a subgroup of such
group.

Using these facts we exclude all the possibilities for G except four
classes from the assertion. On the other hand all these four classes of
subgroups act transitively on the set of planes, so they are minimal. (cid:3)

Remark 3.2. I.Cheltsov and C. Shramov [6] proved that the Segre
cubic with the action of G = A6 has no equivariant birational transfor-
mations to another G-Mori ﬁbration (in other words, the Segre cubic
is G-birationally rigid ). So the G-birational rigidity of Segre cubic
with the action of A5 and S5 is the only open problem related to the
G-rigidity property of the Segre cubic.

4. Cubic hypersurfaces with nine singular points

In this section we consider the case where X is a cubic hypersurface
in P4 of type J9 satisfying Assumption 2.1 and G is the corresponding
minimal subgroup of Aut(X). In this case X is a hyperplane section
of the cubic fourfold Z ⊂ P5, which can be explicitly given by the
following equation: x1x2x3 = y1y2y3 (see [27, Prop. 2.2]). One can
easily see that the group Aut(Z) is isomorphic to (k∗)4 ⋊ (S2
3 ⋊ C2)
where the algebraic torus (k∗)4 acts on coordinates diagonally and the
subgroup S2
3 ⋊ C2 acts naturally by permutation of coodinates (see [27,
Lemma 1.1]). The singular locus Sing(Z) consists of nine lines

lij = {xk = yl = 0, k 6= i, l 6= j}

which intersect X in the singular locus of X. Also Z contains nine
3-spaces

Mij = {xi = yj = 0}

and the intersections of these subspaces with X are planes on X. Note
that there is a natural Aut(X)-equivariant bijection lij ↔ Mij between
lines and 3-spaces on Z.

Suppose that

a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 + b1y1 + b2y2 + b3y3 = 0

is an equation of the hyperplane which cuts out X. Notice that ai 6= 0
and bi 6= 0 for all i. Indeed, otherwise some lines from Sing(Z) meet
X at the same point, this is impossible. Using some diagonal coordi-
nate change one can achieve a1 = a2 = a3 = A, b1 = b2 = b3 = 1
for some number A. One can easily see that if A3
2, then cor-
responding hyperplane sections are isomorphic. Note that if A = −1
then (1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1) is a singular point of X and in fact X is the
Segre cubic. Moreover, if A3 6= −1, 0 then X contains 9 nodes and no
other singularities.

1 = A3

Lemma 4.1. Let Y = Z ∩H be a hyperplane section of Z such that Y is
a cubic hypersurface in P4 with exactly 9 nodes as singularities. Then
every automorphism σ ∈ Aut(Y ) is induced by some automorphism
¯σ ∈ Aut(Z).

Proof. In fact, a proof of this proposition is contained implicitly in the
proof of [27, Prop. 2.2]. For the convenience of the reader we reproduce
a complete proof here.

Let σ be an automorphism of Y . Then there exist a (non-unique)

automorphism eσ ∈ PGL6(k) such that eσ|Y = σ. Denote Z ′ = eσ(Z).

Notice that Z ′ ∩ H = Z ∩ H where H is a hyperplane which cuts
out Y . So it is enough to prove that there exist such automorphism

10

τ ∈ PGL6(k) that τ (Z) = Z ′ and τ |H = Id. Let B be a subgroup of
PGL6(k) which consists of all elements acting trivially on H. Obviously,
G acts transitively on P5 \ H.

The variety Z contains 9 three-dimensional projective subspaces Mij.
ij. We may assume
ij ∩ H (such intersection are exactly planes of Y ).

So Z ′ also contains nine 3-spaces. Denote them by M ′
that Mij ∩ H = M ′
Consider the point

We may assume that

v = (1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0), v =\i6=1

Mij.

Mij =\i6=1

(otherwise we can apply an automorphism τ ′ ∈ B). From Mij∩H = M ′
ij if i 6= 1. Let F ′ = 0 be an equation of Z ′. Then
we deduce Mij = M ′

F ′ is contained in the intersection of idealsTi6=1(xi, yj). It is easy to see

that such intersection coinsides with the ideal (x2x3, y1y2y3), so we may
assume that F ′ = lx2x3 − y1y2y3 for some non-zero linear polynomial
l. Assume that H has an equation m = 0. We know that polynomials
F ′ and x1x2x3 − y1y2y3 coinside on H and Y is irreducible. Thus one
can easily see that m = l − x1 and

ij∩H

F ′ = (x1 + m)x2x3 − y1y2y3

(after normalization). Then the automorphism τ acting via

x1 7→ x1 + m, x2 7→ x2, x3 7→ x3, yi 7→ yi

required automorphism of Z inducing σ.

is contained in B and maps Z to Z ′. Thus the composition τ ◦eσ is a

Hence we obtain that the group Aut(X) is isomorphic to S2

3 ⋊ C2 if
A3 = 1 and S2
3 if A3 6= ±1, 0. But in the last case we have an Aut(X)-
invariant plane x1 = x2 = x3 = 0, so the group Aut(X) is of ﬁber type
by Lemma 2.5. Hence we may assume that X is given by the equations

(cid:3)

(x0x1x2 − x3x4x5 =

xi = 0) ⊂ P5.

5Xi=0

Now we are going to describe all the possible minimal subgroups of
3 ⋊ C2 as a subgroup of S6 with

3 ⋊ C2. We will consider S2

the group S2
the natural action on coordinates.

Proposition 4.2. The minimal subgroup G voinsides with one of the
following groups:

S2

3, C2

3 ⋊ C4, S2

3 ⋊ C2,

11

where ﬁrst group acts transitively on the set of coordinates. Conversely,
all such subgroups of Aut(X) are minimal.

Proof. Recall that there is a natural bijection lij ↔ Mij between sin-
gular lines and 3-spaces on Z. This bijection induces an Aut(X)-
equivarint bijection between singular points and planes on X. Since the
order of the group G is not divisible by 5, a G-orbit of singular point
cannot be of length 5. Hence the group G acts transitively on Sing(X)
by Corollary 2.6 and all planes form a unique G-orbit. Since the group
Cl(X) is a free abelian group generated by classes of planes (see [20]),
all such subgroups are minimal. A subgroup of Aut(X) acts transitively
on Sing(X) if and only if it contains the unique subgroup C2
3 ⊂ Aut(X).
On the other hand, G cannot act on xi’s and yi’s separately since
there is no G-invariant planes. Also, the group S3 × C3 has only 1-
and 2-dimensional irreducible representations, so all subgroups of G
isomorphic to S3 × C3 have a 3-dimensional subrepresentation in our
5-dimensional representation. Thus all such groups have an invariant
plane, so they are of ﬁber type. Thus G is one of the groups from the
statement.

5. Cubic threefolds of type J11

In this section X is a cubic hypersurface in P4 of type J11 satis-
fying Assumption 2.1 and G is the corresponding minimal subgroup
of Aut(X). We will show that this case does not occur

Proposition 5.1. The G-variety X with such properties does not exist.

Proof. Assume that such a G-variety X exists. Any variety of type
J11 has 6 nodes and no other singularities. Also X contains three
planes Π1, Π2 and Π3, each plane containes exactly 4 singularities
and every singularity is contained in two planes. Let us denote sin-
gularities of X by p1, ..., p6. We may assume that planes Π1, Π2 and
Π3 contain (p1, p2, p3, p4), (p1, p2, p5, p6) and (p5, p6, p3, p4), respectively.
These three planes form a hyperplane section of X and have one com-
mon non-singular point. We denote this point by p0. Let us choose a
coordinate system x0, ..., x4 in P4 so that

p0 = (1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0), p1 = (0 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0), p2 = (1 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0),

p3 = (0 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 0), p4 = (1 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 0), p5 = (0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : 0),

The equation of X has the form

p6 = (1 : 0 : 0 : 1 : 0).

x1x2x3 + x4(ax0(x0 − x1 − x2 − x3) + b1x2x3 + b2x1x3 + b3x1x2)+

12

+x2

4(c0x0 + c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x3) + dx3

4 = 0

where a 6= 0 since p0 is non-singular point. So we may assume that
a = 1 without loss of generality (by rescaling x4). Now we perform the
changing of coordinates

x1 7→ x1 − b1x4, x2 7→ x2 − b2x4, x3 7→ x3 − b3x4, x0 7→ x0 −

to reduce the equation of X to the following form:

c0
2

x4

(3) x1x2x3 + x4x0(x0 − x1 − x2 − x3) + x2

4(c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x3) + dx3

4 = 0.

Every automorphism of P4 which preserves all pi has the form

(4)

xi 7→ xi + αix4

for some αi in our coordinate system. It is easy to see that such an
automorphism preserves X if and only if the automorphism is trivial.

Hence we have the canonical injection

Aut(X) → C3

2 ⋊ S3 ⊂ S6

to the group of permutations of singular points. We know by Corol-
lary 2.6 that Aut(X) acts transitively on the set of singular points.
Notice that the involution

σ : (x0 : x1 : x2 : x3 : x4) 7→ (−x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 : x1 : x2 : x3 : x4)

always acts on X. So the action of Aut(X) on Sing(X) is transitive
if and only if Aut(X) contains an element of order 3. All elements
of order 3 in C3
2 ⋊ S3 are conjugate, so we may assume that Aut(X)
contains the automorhism acting on singular points as follows:

p1 7→ p3, p3 7→ p5, p5 7→ p1, p2 7→ p4, p4 7→ p6, p6 7→ p2.

Obviously, such automorphism is the composition of the cyclic permu-
tations of coordinates x1, x2 and x3 and a morphism of type (4). Such
automorphism acts on X if and only if it is cyclic permutation of coor-
dinates (it follows from vanishing of some coeﬃcients) and c1 = c2 = c3.
In this case S3 × C2 acts on X automatically. If Aut(X) = C2 × S3
then we have an Aut(X)-invariant plane x1 + x2 + x3 = x4 = 0 in P4,
this is impossible due to Assumption 2.1. There are no intermediate
groups between C2 × S3 and C3
2 ⋊ S3 ≃ S4 × C2. Hence the last thing
we need to check is when the automorphism which changes p1 and p2
and ﬁxes all other pi’s acts on X. This automorphism can be explicitly
written as

σ′ : (x0 : x1 : x2 : x3 : x4) 7→ (x1 + x4 − x0 : x1 : x4 − x2 : x4 − x3 : x4)

13

(this is the only automorphism which acts in the right way on singu-
larities and preserves vanishing of some coeﬃcients) and the image of
X under this morphism is the variety with the equation

x1x2x3 + x4x0(x0 − x1 − x2 − x3) + x2

4(cid:0)c1x1 + (1 − c2)x2 + (1 − c3)x3(cid:1)+

+(d + c2 + c3 − 1)x3

4 = 0.

This variety coinsides with X if and only if c1 = c2 = c3 = 1
2 .

Consider the subgroup of GL5(k) generated by σ, σ′ (where we re-
place all colons by commas) and permutations of coordinates x1, x2
and x3. This group can be regarded as a lift of Aut(X) ⊂ PGL5(k) to
GL5(k) and is isomorphic to Aut(X). Hence we have a ﬁve-dimensional
representation of Aut(X). Since the group Aut(X) ≃ S4 × C2 has only
one-, two- and three-dimensional irreducible representations, there is a
three-dimensional subrepresentation which gives us an invariant plane
in P4. One can easily see that the plane with the equations

x4 = x0 −

1
2

(x1 + x2 + x3) = 0

is Aut(X)-invariant. Thus Aut(X) is of ﬁber type by Lemma 2.5.
Hence the required G-variety X does not exist.
(cid:3)

6. Cubic threefolds of type J9

In this section X is a cubic hypersurface in P4 of type J9 satis-
fying Assumption 2.1 and G is the corresponding minimal subgroup
of Aut(X). In this case X contains six singularities in general position
(see Proposition 2.9 and Lemma 2.8). Hence the group Aut(X) is em-
bedded canonically into the group of permutations of singularities S6.
Below we regard Aut(X) as a subgroup of S6. We may assume that
singularities of X are

p1 = (1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0), p2 = (0 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 0), p3 = (0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1),

p4 = (0 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0), p5 = (0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : 0), p6 = (1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1).

The equation of X has a form

(5)

X0≤i<j<k≤4

aijkxixjxk = 0,

where for every 0 ≤ t ≤ 4 the sum of all coeﬃcients which has t as
one of the indices equals to zero. Since the group Aut(X) is neither
linearizable nor of ﬁber type, it must act transitively on Sing(X) by
Corollary 2.6.

14

Proposition 6.1. In some coordinate system X is given by the equa-
tion (5) with

(6)

a024 = A, a012 = −a123 = a234 = B, a014 = −a013 = a023 = C,

a034 = a124 = −a134 = D, A + B + C + D = 0,

where A, B, C and D are nonzero numbers. Moreover:

(i) if A = B = −C = −D or A = −B = C = −D or A = −B =

= −C = D then Aut(X) ≃ S5;

(ii) if B = C = D then Aut(X) ≃ S2

of a Sylow 3-subgroup in S6;

3⋊C2, Aut(X) is a normalizer

(iii) if A = −B or A = −C or A = −D then Aut(X) ≃ S4;
(iv) if C = D or B = C or B = D then Aut(X) ≃ D12;
(v) in all other cases Aut(X) ≃ S3.

Proof. At ﬁrst we notice that all coeﬃcients aijk are nonzero. Indeed,
suppose that a012 = 0. Consider the projection from the point p3 to
the hyperplane x4 = 0. The image of the exceptional divisor is a curve,
which is the intersection of the quadric

X0≤i<j≤3

aij4xixj = 0

and the cubic

a013x0x1x3 + a023x0x2x3 + a123x1x2x3 = 0.

But such cubic is reducible, so X cannot be of type J9 (see [12] for
details).

Every subgroup of S6 which acts transitively on the set of singular-
ities contains an element of order 3 acting with two orbits of length 3
(one can easily see it from the table of subgroups of S6 [29]). Without
loss of generality we may assume that this element is (1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6).
Moreover, we can write down its action explicitly:

(x0 : x1 : x2 : x3 : x4) 7→ (x4 − x3 : −x3 : x0 − x3 : x1 − x3 : x2 − x3).
This automorphism maps X to the variety with the equation

a234x0x1x2 + a134x0x1x3 + a124x0x1x4 + a034x0x2x3 + a024x0x2x4+

+a014x0x3x4 − a012x1x2x3 − a013x1x2x4 − a023x1x3x4 − a123x2x3x4 = 0.
This cubic coinsides with X exactly when condition (6) holds. More-
over, the automorphism acting on singular points as (1, 4)(2, 6)(3, 5)
also acts on X in this case. Hence if the condition (6) holds then
Aut(X) acts transitively on the set of singular points.

Assume that Aut(X) contains

H ≃ S3 = h(1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6), (1, 4)(2, 6)(3, 5)i

15

as a proper subgroup. There are exactly seven groups H ′ such that
H ( H ′ and there are no intermediate groups between H and H ′:

• three groups isomorphic to D12. They are generated by H
and either h11 = (1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6) or h12 = (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 4) or
h13 = (1, 6, 3, 2, 5, 4) respectively;

• a unique group isomorphic to S3 × C3 which is generated by

H and h2 = (1, 2, 3);

• three subgroups isomorphic to S4. They are generated by H

and either h31 = (1, 2, 4, 5) or h32 = (1, 2, 5, 6) or h33 = (1, 2, 6, 4)
respectively.

Direct computations show the following:
• h11 preserves X ⇐⇒ C = D;
• h12 preserves X ⇐⇒ B = C;
• h13 preserves X ⇐⇒ B = D;
• h2 preserves X ⇐⇒ B = C = D;
• h31 preserves X ⇐⇒ A = −D;
• h32 preserves X ⇐⇒ A = −B;
• h33 preserves X ⇐⇒ A = −C.

If B = C = D then, obviously, the group Aut(X) contains also ele-
ments (1, 2) and (4, 5) and does not contain h31, so it is equal to S2
3⋊C2.
Now we assume that Aut(X) ) D12 = hH, h11i and Aut(X) does not

contain h2. Then one of the two possibilities occurs (see [8]): either

or

Aut(X) ≃ S4 × C2 = hD12, h32i

Aut(X) ≃ S5 = hD12, h31i.

In the ﬁrst case we have

C = D, A = −B, A + B + C + D = 0,

thus C = D = 0, a contradiction. In the second case

A = B = −C = −D.

All other groups isomorphic to D12 can be considered in the same way.
Now we assume that Aut(X) ) S4 = hH, h31i. Then one of the

three possibilities occurs: either

or

or

Aut(X) ≃ S4 × C2 = hS4, h12i,

Aut(X) ≃ S5 = hS4, h11i,

Aut(X) ≃ S5 = hS4, h13i.

16

All these cases have already been considered.

(cid:3)

Remark 6.2. One can easily verify that a variety given by equation
(i) or (ii) of Proposition 6.1 is of type J9.

Proposition 6.3. In the notation of the previous proposition Aut(X)
cannot be isomorphic to S3, S4 or D12.
If Aut(X) ≃ S5, then
G = Aut(X). If Aut(X) ≃ S2
3 ⋊ C2, then G = Aut(X) or a unique
subgroup isomorphic to S2

3 acting transitively on Sing(X).

Proof. Here we use the notation of the proof of the previous proposition.
Assume that Aut(X) equals to H or D12 = hH, h11i (we do not lose
generality since we may consider groups up to conjugation in S6).
Consider the point (1 : −1 : 0 : −1 : 1). The Aut(X)-orbit of this
point consists of three points

(1 : −1 : 0 : −1 : 1), (2 : 1 : 2 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 2 : 1 : 2).

They are not collinear, so the plane through them is the Aut(X)-
invariant plane. In the case Aut(X) ≃ S4 = hH, h31i we may consider
the point (1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 2) with the same property. In any case Aut(X)
is of ﬁber type by Lemma 2.5, it is a contradiction with Assumption 2.1.
Let π be a projection to the hyperplane L = {x0 = 0} from the point
p1. The exceptional divisor of π is mapped to two rational curves Γ1
and Γ2 and singular points pi, i > 1, are mapped to ﬁve intersection
points Γ1 ∩ Γ2 (see [12] for details). Denote ri = π(pi), i > 1. Let Si
be a preimage of Γi. Then the class of S1 and 1
2KX generate Cl(X)
(see [12]) and S1 + S2 ∼ −KX .

Assume that Aut(X) ≃ S5. Since G acts transitively on Sing(X)
and is not contained in S4 nor D12, the group G must be equal either
to A5 or to S5. The group A5 cannot act on the lattice Cl(X) with
rk Cl(X)G = 1, so G = Aut(X). Now we will prove that Aut(X) acts
minimally on X. Let F ≃ C5 ⋊ C4 be the stabilizer of the point p1.
Then π is an F -equivariant map. A subgroup C5 ⊂ F acts non-trivially
on Sing(X). Thus the group F cannot act on rational curve and need
to permute Γi’s. Hence F interchanges S1 and S2, so F acts minimally
on X.

Finally, consider the case Aut(X) ≃ S2

3 ⋊ C2. The stabilizer of
the point p1 is isomorphic to S3 × C2 ≃ D12 and acts faithfully on
Sing(X) \ {p1} with two orbits of length 2 and 3 respectively. Thus
the stabilizer of p1 cannot act on Γ1 and Γ2 separatly and the group
Aut(X) is minimal for the same reason as in the previous case.

The kernel of the homomorphism

Aut(X) → Aut(Cl(X)) ≃ GL2(Z)

17

is a subgroup of Aut(X) of index 2. There are exactly three subgroups
of index 2 in Aut(X): the group G1 ≃ S2
3 which does not act transi-
tively on Sing(X), the group G2 ≃ S2
3 acting transitively on Sing(X)
and the group G3 ≃ C2
3 ⋊ C4. The ﬁrst subgroup has the same stabilizer
of p1 as Aut(X), so this subgroup cannot be the kernel.

Assume that δ = (1, 4)(2, 6)(3, 5) ∈ G2 acts trivially on Cl(X). One
can easily check that the set of δ-invariant points of X consists of an

resolution of singularities. Then the contraction of some extremal ray
gives us a δ-equivariant P1-ﬁbration over P2 (see [20, Theorem 5.2]).
If δ acts trivially on the base then there is a divisor of ﬁxed points

elliptic curve and three points. Let τ : eX → X be a δ-equivariant small
on eX and the same is true for X since τ is small. A contradiction.
points on eX. These lines cannot be contracted by τ since there are

If δ acts non-trivially on the base then the set of δ-invariant points
on P2 consists a line and a point. Thus there are two lines of ﬁxed

no δ-invariant singular points on X. This is impossible. Thus δ acts
non-trivially on Cl(X). Hence G3 is the required kernel.

The group G is a subgroup of Aut(X) acting transitively on Sing(X)
which is not a subgroup of C2
3 ⋊ C4. Also G is not contained in
any subgroup of Aut(X) isomorphic to D12 for the same reason as
Aut(X) 6≃ D12. Thus either G is conjugate to S3 × C3 = hH, (1, 2, 3)i
or G coinsides with G2 or Aut(X). But in the ﬁrst case the G-orbit of
the point (ω : ω2 − 1 : −2 : ω − 1 : ω2) where ω is a cubic root of unity
has length 3.
(cid:3)

7. Five singular points

In this section we assume that X is a cubic hypersurface in P4
with exactly ﬁve singular points in general position satisfying Assump-
tion 2.1 and G is the corresponding minimal subgroup of Aut(X).

Proposition 7.1. The variety X can be given in some coordinate sys-
tem by the equation

(x0x1x2 + x1x2x3 + x2x3x4 + x3x4x0 + x4x0x1)+

+a(x0x1x3 + x1x2x4 + x2x3x0 + x3x4x1 + x4x0x2) = 0, a3 = 1.

The group Aut(X) is isomorphic to S5 if a = 1 and to A5 otherwise.
The group G is isomorphic either to S5 or A5 or C5 ⋊ C4. All the
singularities of X are nodes.

18

Proof. We assume that singular points are pi = {xj = δj
tion of X in such a coordinate system is

i }. The equa-

X0≤i<j<k≤4

aijkxixjxk.

The action of Aut(X) on the set of singularities of X induces a homo-
morphism Aut(X) → S5 with transitive image, so the image contains
an element of order 5. Without loss of generality we may assume
that the image contains the element (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Obviously, every el-
ement of PGL5(k) which permutes cyclically singularities of X is the
composition of some diagonal map and the cyclic permutation of co-
ordinates. All such elements are conjugate to each other by diagonal
map. This can be seen from the explicit equations for elements of
corresponding diagonal matrix. Moreover such diagonal change of co-
ordinates is unique. As a consequence, we see that the homomorphism
Aut(X) → S5 is an embedding. Thus we may assume that Aut(X)
contains a cyclic permutation of coordinates and

a012 = a123 = a234 = a034 = a014, a013 = a124 = a023 = a134 = a024.

Note that all coeﬃcients are nonzero, otherwise the singularities of X
are not isolated. Thus we may assume that a012 = 1 and a013 = a for
some nonzero a. Note that if a = −1 then X has one more singularity
at the point (1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1), so a 6= −1. Obviously, D10 acts
on X naturally. Up to conjugation there are three subgroups in S5
containing D10 as a proper subgroup: C5 ⋊ C4, A5 and S5. The group

C5 ⋊ C4 = hD10, (2, 3, 5, 4)i

acts on X if and only if a = 1 and, obviously, in this case Aut(X) = S5.
The group A5 = hD10, (1, 2, 3)i acts on X if and only if a3 = 1.

Now we assume that a3 6= 1. Consider points (1 : ζ : ζ 2 : ζ 3 : ζ 4)
and (1 : ζ 4 : ζ 3 : ζ 2 : ζ), where ζ is a primitive ﬁfth degree root of
unity. They form a D10-orbit and lie on X. The line l passing through
them also lies on X. Indeed, othewise l has the same local intersection
numbers with X at both of this points, so there is the third intersection
point of l and X. Such a point must be invariant under the action of
D10, which can be true only if this point is (1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1). But such
a point does not lie on X since a 6= −1, a contradiction. Hence the
projection from l gives us conic ﬁbration, which is equivalent to the
some Mori ﬁbration. Thus a3 = 1.

The group G acts transitively on Sing(X) and is not contained in
D10, so it must be one of the groups from the statement. In both cases
(a = 1 or a is a primitive cubic root of unity) X has only ordinary

19

double points as singularities, so Cl(X) is generated by the class of
hyperplane section (see [12]). Hence all the subgroups of Aut(X) are
minimal automatically. One can easily check the last statement of the
proposition by a direct computation.
(cid:3)

8. Four singular points

Proposition 8.1. Under the assumptions of 2.1 the variety X cannot
have less than 5 singular points.

Proof. Assume that X has less than 5 singular points. Then X has
exactly 4 singularities in general position and Aut(X) acts on Sing(X)
transitively by the Corollary 2.6. Let S be a hyperplane section of X
passing through all the singular points. It is a singular cubic surface
(maybe reducible) with at least four singular points in general position.
Due to [4] such a surface must be either the special cubic surface with
four nodes or reducible. In the second case S must be either a union
of three planes with unique common point or a union of a quadric
cone whose vertice is a singular point of X and a plane, otherwise
singularities of X cannot be in general position. In both cases Aut(X)
cannot act transitively on Sing(X): if S is a union of three planes either
the common point of planes is a distinguished singularity of X or there
is a distinguished plane that contains exactly two singularities of X;
if S is a union of a quadric cone and a plane then the vertice of the
cone is a distinguished singularity of X. The cubic surface with four
singularities of type A1 in suitable coordinate system has the equation

F (x0, x1, x2, x3) = x0x1x2 + x0x1x3 + x0x2x3 + x1x2x3 = 0.

So in some coordinate system X has the equation [4]

F (x0, x1, x2, x3) + x4 X0≤i<j≤3

4 X0≤i≤3

aijxixj + x2

bixi + cx3

4 = 0.

After some changing of coordinates as follows

(7)

xi 7→ (xi + αix4), α4 = 0

with appropriate αi we obtain

(8)

a02 = a13 = A, a01 = a23 = B, a12 = a03 = C, A + B + C = 0

for some numbers A, B, C. Moreover, such changing of coordinates
is unique (one can easily see this by solving the corresponding system
of equations for αi). Every element σ ∈ PGL5(k) which preserves
Sing(X) can be represented as a composition σ = σ3 ◦ σ2 ◦ σ1 where σ1
permute the coordinates x0, x1, x2, x3, σ2 acts by a multiplying x4 with
some number and σ3 looks like (7). Automophisms σ1 and σ2 preserve

20

the property (8), while σ3 preserves it if and only if σ3 is trivial. So,
every element of Aut(X) is a composition σ2 ◦ σ1 and consequently it
preserves the subspace x4 = x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 = 0. Thus the group
Aut(X) is of ﬁber type by Lemma 2.5.
