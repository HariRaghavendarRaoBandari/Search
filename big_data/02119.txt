N-SOLITONS IN THE CUBIC NLS EQUATION: ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR AND

ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY

AARON SAALMANN

ABSTRACT. In this article we consider the Cauchy problem for the cubic focusing nonlinear Schr¨o-
dinger (NLS) equation on the line. Using the inverse scattering method and the Riemann Hilbert
point of view we address the asymptotic stability of N-solitons and prove the decay of the L¥
(R)
norm of the residual term in time.

We study the cubic focusing nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation

1. INTRODUCTION

iut + uxx + 2|u|2u = 0,

(1.1)
on R where u(x,t) : R × R → C. The initial value problem for (1.1) is globally well posed in L2(R)
due to the results of Tsutsumi [12]. The linear Schr¨odinger equation iqt + qxx = 0 is dispersive.
Here, dispersion means that any solution q of the linear Schr¨odinger equation has the property
x ∼ t−1/2 as t → ¥
. Once nonlinear effects are included soliton solutions appear. Instead of
kqkL¥
dispersion, in the NLS equation we have that any solution decomposes into a solitary wave and a
dispersive part as t → ¥
In this paper we will prove the following reﬁnement of Theorem 1.3 in [6]:
Theorem 1.1. Fix s ∈ (1/2, 1]. For each N-soliton solN
z1,..,zN,c1,...,cN (x,t), such that Re (z j) 6=
Re (zk) for j 6= k, there exist positive constants e 0, T,C > 0 which depend on (z1, .., zN; c1, ..., cN)

In [4] Contreras and Pelinovsky establish the orbital stability of N-solitons in the L2(R) space
under the assumption (1.2). As mentioned by these authors they believed that also our (stronger)
result (1.4) holds. In this paper we do not use the dressing method like in [4] but we will reduce
the stability of N-solitons to the stability of 1-solitons. Therefor we consider a Riemann Hilbert
problem and its solution m from which the solution u of (1.1) can be recovered. Then motivated
by the paper of Cuccagna and Jenkins [5] we will deﬁne modiﬁcations m 7→ m(2) 7→ m(r)
such that
j0
in the end m(r)
corresponds either to the 1-soliton case or to a pure radiation solution. Although
j0
Theorem 1.1 is hence just a corollary of Cuccagna’s results in [6], we state Theorem 1.1 explicitly
in this paper.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives some information about the direct in inverse
scattering transform. In Section 3 we consider radiation-free solutions of the NLS equation (i.e.
N-solitons). We will explain how the asymptotic behavior of N-solitons can be analyzed by reduc-
ing the Riemann Hilbert problem of N-solitons to the Riemann Hilbert problem of the 1-soliton.
Finally in Section 4 we will use the same technique in order to prove Theorem 1.1.

2. THE INVERSE SCATTERING TRANSFORM

A key ingredient for many results on stability of solitary waves comes from the methods of

inverse scattering. The following theorem summarizes the theory:

Theorem 2.1. Let s ∈ (1/2, 1]. There exist open sets GN ⊂ L1(R) (N ∈ N ∪ {0}) and transforma-
tions

such that:

(i) G :=SN∈N∪{0}

GN is dense in L1;

the following three steps:

SN(u0).

(ii) The maps SN are locally Lipschitz and one-to-one;
(iii) The solution of (1.1) with u(x, 0) = u0(x) and u0 ∈ H1(R) ∩ L2,s(R) ∩ GN can be obtained by

1. Step: Calculate the scattering data associated with u0, i.e. (r(z); z1, ..., zN; c1, ..., cN) :=

2. Step: Solve the following Riemann Hilbert problem:

RHP[NLS]:
Find for each (x,t) ∈ R × R a 2 × 2-matrix valued function C ∋ z 7→ m(z; x,t) which
satisﬁes

(i) m(z; x,t) is meromorphic in C \ R (with respect to the parameter z).

(ii) m(z; x,t) = 1 + O(cid:0) 1

z(cid:1) as |z| → ¥

jump relation m+ = m−V (r), where

.

(iii) The non-tangential boundary values m±(z; x,t) exist for z ∈ R and satisfy the

with

f (z) := 2ixz + 4iz2t.

3. Step: Calculate the required solution via

(2.5)

u(x,t) := 2i lim

z→¥ z [m(z; x,t)]12 .

Here [·]12 denotes the 1-2-component of the matrix in the brackets.

The fact that RHP[NLS] is uniquely solvable is pointed out by Deift and Park in [7]. For the
convenience of the reader we show roughly how the scattering maps SN are deﬁned: Given a
function u(x) we set

P(z; x) :=(cid:18) −iz

−u(x)

u(x)

iz (cid:19)

and consider the ODE

(2.6)
We deﬁne y (±)

where e1 = (1, 0)T and e2 = (0, 1)T . In general if u(·) ∈ L1(R), the functions y (−)
for Im z ≥ 0 whereas y (+)
z is analytic. Due to trP = 0, expressions such as det[y (−)
on x. We set

(z; x)],

such that a is deﬁned for z ∈ C+ and b is deﬁned for z ∈ R. Additionally the map z 7→ a(z) is
analytic in the upper plane C+. The sets GN stated in Theorem 2.1 are now deﬁned by the number
of zeros of a:

GN :=(cid:8)u ∈ L1(R)|a admits exactly N simple zeros z1, ..., zN ∈ C+(cid:9) .

In [3] Beals and Coifman show, that the GN are indeed open. Furthermore they prove statement (i)
of Theorem 2.1. Now we amount to the deﬁnition of the scattering data (r(z); z1, ..., zN; c1, ..., cN):

Reﬂection coefﬁcient: The so-called reﬂection coefﬁcient r is given by

(2.7)

r(z) :=

b(z)
a(z)

,

z ∈ R.

As it is shown in [6] by Cuccagna, we have r ∈ Hs(R) in the case of u ∈ L2,s(R). Note the analogy
to the Fourier transform. See also [14] for more general results.

Poles: The zk are deﬁned to be the simple zeros of a. Hence, we have a(zk) = 0 but a′(zk) 6= 0
(the ′ indicates the derivative with respect to the complex parameter z). We will refer to them as
poles.
Norming constants: The so-called norming constants c1, .., cN are given by ck := g k/a′(zk),

where g k are deﬁned by the equations y (−)

(zk; x) = g ky (+)

1

(zk; x). Due to

2

det[y (−)
(zk; x) and y (+)

1

(zk; x)] = a(zk;t) = 0

(zk; x)|y (+)
(zk; x) are indeed linearly dependent, which implies that the

2

the two vectors y (−)
numbers g k exist. They do not depend on x which is veriﬁed by differentiation.

which is equivalent to the following important formula:

u(x) = 2i lim

z→¥ z[m(z; x)]12.

Here m(z; x) is the matrix deﬁned from the functions y ±
j as above. So far we have described
the forward scattering and the inverse scattering, since we can reconstruct the function u from its
scattering data.
Now we are going to take into account the time t. If u also depends on t (i.e. u = u(x,t)) and
u(·,t) ∈ L1(R) for any t ∈ R, we can obtain the functions a and b as above for all times t ∈ R.
Thus, we have a(z;t) and b(z;t) and we can ask for the time evolution of these two functions. The
miraculous fact is the following: if u(x,t) solves the NLS equation (1.1) and u(·,t) ∈ H1(R) for all
t ∈ R, then

¶ ta(z;t) = 0

and

¶ tb(z;t) = 4iz2b(z;t).

The derivation of these equations is based on the Lax pair representation of the NLS equation (see
[8]). Solving them for a and b we obtain a(z;t) = a(z; 0) and r(z;t) = e4iz2tr(z; 0). In particular, if
at time t = 0 the function u(x, 0) produces N simple zeros z1, ..., zN of z 7→ a(z; 0) and if u evolves
accordingly to the NLS equation, then u(·,t) will produce exactly the same N simple zeros at any
other time t ∈ R. A weaker formulation: the sets GN are invariant under the ﬂow of the NLS

equation.
Since the poles z1, ..., zN remain unchanged over time, we can ﬁnd by the same arguments as
above the norming constants ck(t). They now depend on t and their evolution is given by ck(t) =
ck(0)e4iz2
kt. Altogether the scattering data of a function u(·,t), which is a solution of the NLS
equation (1.1), is given at time t by

(2.10)

1tc1, ..., e4iz2

NtcN),

where (r(z); z1, ..., zN; c1, ..., cN) are obtained from the initial data u(x, 0) = u0(x). Inserting the
time dependence into (2.8) and (2.9) we end up exactly with (2.1) and (2.3). Summarized the
method of (inverse) scattering works as follows:

3. N-SOLITONS

In this section we consider initial data u0, such that r(z) ≡ 0 for the corresponding reﬂection
coefﬁcient r. If u0 ∈ G0 the Riemann Hilbert problem RHP[NLS] (see Theorem 2.1) then reduces
to: (i) m(z; x,t) is entire (with respect to z); (ii) m(z; x,t) = 1 + O(z−1) as |z| → ¥
. By Liouville’s
Theorem it follows that m(z; x,t) ≡ 1 and applying (2.5) we obtain u(x,t) ≡ 0. Now, let us consider
the case N = 1. Assuming S1(u0) = (r ≡ 0; z1; c1) we have to consider the following:

RHP[1-soliton]:

Find a 2 × 2-matrix valued function C ∋ z 7→ m(z; x,t) which satisﬁes

(i) m(z; x,t) is meromorphic in C (with respect to z),

(ii) m(z; x,t) = 1 + O(cid:0) 1

The explicit solution of the NLS equation, which can now be obtained by the reconstruction for-
mula (2.5), is commonly called soliton or 1-soliton:

(3.3)

sol1

z1,c1(x,t) := −2i Im (z1)e−i[arg(c1)+2 Re (z1)x+4 Re (z2

2 Im (z1)(cid:19)(cid:21) .

It describes a single wave packet which is centered at

(3.4)

x0 = (2 Im (z1))−1 ln(cid:18) |c1|

2 Im (z1)(cid:19) − 4 Re (z1)t.

So we see, that the wave is propagating with the velocity v = −4 Re (z1). In doing so, its envelope
remains undistorted. Thus the points (3.38) and (3.39) of the deﬁnition of Drazin and Johnson (see
Remark 3.7 at the end of this Section) ﬁt very well to what we see from (3.3).

Remark 3.1. The expressions (3.2) show us that A(x,t) and eA(x,t) are bounded independently of

|m(z; x,t)| ≤

|z−z1|≥r

C
r

for some small r > 0 and a constant C > 0, which does not depend on x and t. Due to det m(z; x,t) ≡
1 the same holds for [m(z; x,t)]−1.

Remark 3.2. For any solution m of an arbitrary Riemann Hilbert problem which is formulated in
this paper we have detm ≡ 1. An explicit calculation shows that the particular residuum conditions
effect analyticity of z 7→ det m. m → 1 as |z| → ¥ ﬁnally leads to det m → 1 as |z| → ¥
and thus by
Liouville we have det m ≡ 1.

The scattering behavior of solitons is investigated by considering so-called N-solitons. We de-
ﬁne N-solitons to be those elements of GN, such that the corresponding reﬂection coefﬁcient is
identically zero. It amounts to consider the following Riemann Hilbert problem:

Here z1, ..., zN ∈ C+, c1, ..., cN ∈ C \ {0} are given. The function associated (via (2.5)) to the

(unique) solution of RHP[N-sol] is what we now call N-soliton. We denote it by

solN

z1,..,zN,c1,...,cN (x,t).

In principle RHP[N-sol] can also be solved explicitly for N ≥ 2. Thus also a formula for N-solitons
is available and hence we have a large family of explicit solutions of the cubic NLS equation.
However the expressions are rather lengthy. What will be of interest is the well-known fact, that an
N-soliton approximates the sum of 1-solitons. The following statement can also be found in [13].
Theorem 3.3. If Re (z j) 6= Re (zk) for j 6= k, then the asymptotic behavior of an N-soliton is given
by the following: There exist constants T,C,r > 0, which only depend on z1, .., zN, c1, ..., cN, such
that

A proof of Theorem 3.3 can be done without an explicit formula for N-solitons. We will present
a technique, which reduces the N-pole Riemann Hilbert Problem RHP[N-sol] to N 1-pole RHP
of the form RHP[1-soliton]. The same technique will later be used to prove the stability result
Theorem 1.1. The parameter

Proof. (i) is trivial, (ii) is a consequence of

(iv) is also elementary. It remains to show, that (iii) holds. We have therefore to show that (3.16)
and (3.17) are correct and moreover we have to show that the poles at zk and zk (k 6= j0(x )) are
indeed removed. Firstly we consider m(1) close to zk in the case where j0(x ) 6= k ∈ ▽(x ): Let m
be a solution of RHP[N-sol]. Then we have

m(z) =

We have used the function T (z, x,t) to deﬁne the transformation m 7→ m(1). As a consequence
the poles at zk (and zk, respectively) are removed and instead a jump on the correspondent disk
boundaries appears. Next we are going to prove rigorously the fact that this jump V (1) deﬁned in
(4.7) does not meaningfully contribute to the solution of RHP[1] as t → ¥
. Therefor we consider
again a Riemann Hilbert problem:

RHP[ j0] can be viewed as RHP[1] with V (1) ≡ 1. Since limt→¥ V (1) = 1 (pointwise), due to
(3.8), it is not surprising that somehow the solution of RHP[1] is converging to that of RHP[ j0] as
t → ¥

. Indeed, we have:

Lemma 3.5. There is a matrix M(x,t) for which

kMk ≤ ce−8r 2t

(t > 0)

(with c > 0 independent of x) holds and such that

(if j0 6= 0). We begin with j0 ∈ ▽ and consider m(err)(z) close to z j0. By det m(1) ≡ detm(sol)

The cases z → z j0 and j0 ∈ △ are similar. (ii) and (iii) of RHP[err] are obvious.

By z ∈ ⊖ we indicate that the limit is to be taken non-tangentially from the minus (right) side of
the (counter-clockwise) orientated contour S

(1). In other words we set:

⊖ := C \ ⊕.

z∈S (1)

|V (err)(z) − 1|k f kL2(S (1))

From the deﬁnition of V (err)(z), the boundedness of m(sol)

Combining this estimate with (3.29) we obtain

kCV kL2(S (1))→L2(S (1)) ≤ ce−8r 2t

with c > 0 independent of x. We conclude that for t sufﬁciently large 1 −CV is invertible and
(3.31)

withec > 0 (again independent of x). This implies for large t that m = (1 −CV )−11 is uniformly

bounded, which means that the bound does not depend on x and t. Equation (3.27) tells us how to
choose the desired M in (4.11):

k(1 −CV )−1kL2(S (1))→L2(S (1)) ≤ec

Making use of H¨older inequality it is now simple to verify by (3.31) and again (3.30), that indeed
kMk ≤ ce−8r 2t.

Proof of Theorem 3.3. Firstly we show that the function deﬁned by the right hand side of (3.32)

The latter estimate and (3.36) prove the required statement (3.6) for the case t → ¥
. The proof for
the behavior of N-solitons as t → −¥
can be done analogously. The difference will be, that we
have to exchange ▽(x ) for △(x ) in the deﬁnition (3.15) of m(1). As a consequence we will have

Remark 3.7. In [10] Drazin and Johnson deﬁne, to which solutions (of a nonlinear PDE) one shall
associate the term soliton:

(3.38)
(3.39)
(3.40)

a soliton represents a wave of permanent form;
a soliton is localized, so that it decays or approaches a constant at inﬁnity;
a soliton can interact strongly with other solitons and retain its identity.

We close this section with pointing out the connection between the point (3.40) of the deﬁni-
z1,c1(x,t) and

4. STABILITY OF N-SOLITONS

In this section we want to establish Theorem 1.1 as a corollary of the following results in [6]:

Theorem 4.1. Fix s ∈ (1/2, 1] and let r ∈ Hs(R).
(i) Consider the solution m of RHP[NLS] without any poles (N = 0). There exist e ,C, T > 0

such that for krkHs(R) < e the associated function u (see (2.5)) satisﬁes

(4.1)

(R) ≤ CkrkHs(R)|t|− 1

(ii) Fix z1 ∈ C+ and c1 ∈ C \ {0} and consider the solution m of RHP[NLS] without any poles
the associated function u (see

(N = 0). There exist e ,C, T > 0 such that for krkHs(R) < e

The effect of this modiﬁcation is again that N or N − 1 (depending on x ) poles are removed:

Analogously to the previous section we want to compare RHP[NLS] to a similar RHP which

does not provide a jump on the circles. Therefor we consider

The proof of our main result Theorem 1.1 works as follows: We assume u0 ∈ H1(R) ∩ L2,s(R).
Furthermore we assume (1.2), which gives us by Theorem 2.1 (i) u0 ∈ GN. Then the scattering
Re (ˆzk). The Lipschitz continuity of the Scattering transformation yields krkHs(R) < Ce and we
can apply the above explained way of handling the RHP[NLS]. At the end we will have (1.4)
analogously to (4.14). Thus the proof of our main result is done for u0 ∈ H1(R). Density arguments
like those in [6] prove the statement for u0 ∈ H1(R) ∩ L2,s(R) but u0 /∈ H1(R).
