Abstract

We evaluate quantum eﬀects due to a 2-component Dirac ﬁeld in
2+1 space-time dimensions, coupled to domain-wall like defects with a
smooth shape. We show that those eﬀects induce non trivial contribu-
tions to the (shape-dependent) energy of the domain walls. For a single
defect, we study the divergences in the corresponding self-energy, and
also consider the role of the massless zero mode, corresponding to the
Callan-Harvey mechanism, by coupling the Dirac ﬁeld to an external
gauge ﬁeld. For two defects, we show that the Dirac ﬁeld induces a
non trivial, Casimir-like eﬀect between them, and provide an exact
expression for that interaction in the case of two straight-line parallel
defects. As is the case for the Casimir interaction energy, the result is
ﬁnite and unambiguous.

1 Introduction
The study of eﬀects due to fermionic ﬁelds in the background of defects,
has been a subject of general interest in rather diﬀerent areas, from the
behavior of textures in superﬂuid phases of He3 [1] to cosmic strings [2]. A
representative of those phenomena is the Callan-Harvey eﬀect [3], where a
Fermi ﬁeld in an odd-dimensional spacetime couples to a defect, the latter
corresponding to a mass term which changes sign along a domain wall. Under

1

these circumstances, the Dirac ﬁeld spawns a localized zero mode which may
be capable of carrying currents when coupled to a gauge ﬁeld.

A similar phenomenon happens also in a non-relativistic two-dimensional
electron gas in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld in the regime of the quantum
Hall eﬀect, where those zero modes become the so called chiral edge states
[4].

In this paper we evaluate yet another eﬀect due to the interplay between
the fermionic ﬁeld and domain walls, this time involving not just the presence
of the zero mode, but also the quantum ﬂuctuations of the fermionic ﬁeld on
top of the domain walls. This eﬀect amounts to the emergence of non trivial
contributions to the vacuum energy as a function of the wall(s) geometry.
One should indeed expect this kind of eﬀect, since the existence of the walls
produces a geometry dependent distortion of the vacuum ﬂuctuation, a fertile
set up for the induction of Casimir-like eﬀects. Indeed, the quantum vacuum
interaction between kinks of the Sine-Gordon equation has been evaluated in
Ref.[5] using the TGTG-formula [6]. This force is attractive, and it should
be considered as a small quantum correction to the well known repulsive
classical force between kinks [7].

Having in mind its potential application to graphene [8], where some
eﬀective continuum models correspond to Dirac ﬁelds in 2 + 1 dimensions
coupled to space-dependent masses [9], we evaluate here some eﬀects due to
the vacuum (i.e., zero temperature) quantum ﬂuctuations of a Dirac ﬁeld in
the presence of domain walls [10]. Since there is no reason a priori to assume
that just the zero modes are relevant to this eﬀect, we will include all the
modes.

Eﬀective continuum models for graphene using Dirac ﬁelds generally in-
volve not just a single 2-component ﬁeld, but an even number of them, what
amounts to putting the Dirac ﬁeld in a reducible representation of Poincaré’s
group in 2 + 1 dimensions. Nevertheless, since those models can be con-
structed in terms of decoupled 2-component ﬁelds in a rather straightforward
way, we will consider just the latter, i.e., spinors in an irreducible represen-
tation. Besides, the 2 component case is relevant to other applications in
condensed matter physics, like the above mentioned quantum Hall eﬀect
case.

The domain wall energy is usually described by means of an eﬀective
Landau-Ginzburg like functional of its shape (assumed to be smooth). That
functional could, at least in principle, be obtained from a detailed micro-
scopic model for the system. In this context, contributions depending on, for
example, the crystal structure, should be quite relevant. We focus, in this
work, on contributions to the domain wall energy, which should appear on
top of the ones coming from the lattice structure. Besides, we also obtain a

2

result corresponding to two domain walls, whereby the Dirac ﬁeld is shown to
induce an attractive, Casimir-like force. This force does not have, to the best
of our knowledge, an analogue within the context of the phenomenological
model, since it is not a contact interaction which could be incorporated by
means of a local term into the energy.

For static-wall conﬁgurations, we shall see that the eﬀective action pre-
dicts the existence of an eﬀective interaction between domain-wall like defects
in the mass (the ‘pseudo-gap’). We also study the dependence of that in-
teraction as a function of the geometry of the defects, at least under some
simplifying assumptions and for particular cases.

This paper is organized as follows:

in Sect. 2 we describe the kind of
model that we consider in this article, introduce our notation and conven-
tions, and deﬁne its eﬀective action. As a warming up exercise we consider,
in Sect. 3, the case of a single domain wall, namely, of a static mass that
changes sign along a single spatial curve, having constant values (and the
same module) everywhere else. The corresponding self-energy is divergent,
even the contributions corresponding to small deformations of a rectilinear
wall. We also verify, by coupling the ﬁeld to an external gauge ﬁeld, that the
massless fermion mode is properly taken into account in our approach.

Then in Sect. 4 we deal with the situation of a static mass that changes
sign on two spatial curves, also having the same constant value elsewhere.
We compute exactly the interaction energy for the particular case of two
straight lines, showing that the force between defects is always attractive. A
perturbative expansion to treat cases when the shape of one of the rectilinear
walls is slightly perturbed can be implemented. An Appendix contains the
details corresponding to the ﬁrst and second order terms.

Sect. 5 contains our conclusions.

2 The system
The system that we consider in this work is deﬁned in terms of an Euclidean
action S, given by:

S( ¯ψ, ψ, M ) =

d3x ¯ψ(x)D ψ(x) ,

(1)

(cid:90)

with D ≡(cid:54) ∂ + M (x), for a Dirac ﬁeld ψ(x), ¯ψ(x) in the presence of a space
dependent mass M (x), in 2 + 1 dimensions. We have adopted the convention
that x denotes the three Euclidean spacetime coordinates, x0, x1, x2, while
x corresponds to just x1 and x2.

3

In the representation we adopt for Dirac’s algebra, γµ, µ = 0, 1, 2, are
Hermitian 2×2 matrices, satisfying {γµ, γν} = 2 δµν. Indices from the middle
of the Greek alphabet, like µ, ν, . . . , run from 0 to 2, while Roman ones can
take the values 1 and 2. The Dirac ﬁeld has two spinorial components, and
it can be used as a building block for higher, reducible representations (this
is indeed the usual situation in graphene models).
Regarding the speciﬁc form of the mass M (x), we shall restrict ourselves
in this work to conﬁgurations such that |M (x)| = m = constant almost ev-
erywhere, changing sign along a two-dimensional spacetime region U which,
for static domain walls, has the form

U = C × R

(2)
where C is a one dimensional region contained on R2, the x1, x2 plane. For
static conﬁgurations, C is assumed, in this paper, to correspond to either
a single curve, or to two disjoint regular curves.
In the next sections, we
discuss those two cases separately.

We conclude this Section by introducing the eﬀective action, Γ(M ):

where

Z(M ) =

DψD ¯ψ e−S( ¯ψ,ψ,M ) ,

e−Γ(M ) = Z(M ) ,

(cid:90)

(3)

(4)

is the Euclidean vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude. From Γ(M ) one
can obtain the vacuum energy E:

E = lim
T→∞

Γ(M )

T

,

(5)

where T denotes the extent of the time-like coordinate x0 (regarded tem-
porarily as ﬁnite but tending to inﬁnity to extract the vacuum energy).
We also note that Z(M ) can be formally written in terms of a fermionic

determinant; indeed,

Z(M ) = detD .

(6)
Note that the eﬀective action is real; indeed, since we work in the Euclidean
formalism, any imaginary part of Γ(M ), had it existed, should have been par-
ity violating (since the imaginary part of the action is parity violating). But
no parity violating functional (either local or nonlocal) can be constructed in
terms of just a scalar function and its derivatives. On the other hand, having
in mind its application to graphene, the reducible representations used in
that context for the fermions are such that the action is explicitly real).

4

Thus, having the above discussion in mind, we can write:

Z(M ) = detD = detD† = (cid:2) detD† detD(cid:3)1/2

= (cid:0) detH(cid:1)1/2 = (cid:0) det ˘H)1/2 ,

where

H ≡ D†D ,

˘H ≡ DD† .

Taking into account our assumptions about M (x), we see that:

H = −∂2 + m2− (cid:54) ∂M (x)
˘H = −∂2 + m2+ (cid:54) ∂M (x) .

(7)

(8)

(9)

Since results that can be expressed in terms of Γ are independent of the sign
of M, one can work with either H or ˘H; in the remainder of this paper, we
use the former. Thus,

Γ(M ) = − 1
2

log detH = − 1
2

Tr log H .

(10)

3 A single domain wall
We consider here a time-independent M, i.e., M = M (x), which has a domain
wall defect along a single closed curve C. In other words, M (x) jumps from
−m to +m when crossing C (physical observables, like the vacuum energy,
are independent of the sign of the jump).

In order to gain some insight into the nature of the system, let us deﬁne
ﬁrst the domain wall implicitly, in terms of a smooth function F (x), assumed
to vanish with a non-zero gradient on C. Then we set M (x) = m σ(F (x))
(m ≥ 0), where σ denotes the sign function. Thus, we see that the operator
H introduced in (9) has the form:

H = H0 + HI ,

(11)

with

H0 = − ∂2 + m2 , HI = −2 m δ[F (x)] γj∂jF (x) ,

(12)
where δ denotes Dirac’s delta function, and H0 is proportional to the (omit-
ted) 2 × 2 unit matrix.
By an application of the coarea formula, we note that HI can also be
rendered in the form: HI(x) = γiAi(x), where

with τ → y(τ ) a parametrization of C, and ˆni(τ ) is the ith component of
ˆn(τ ), the unit normal 1 to C at the point y(τ ). Thus,

3.1 Eﬀective action and self-energy
As it should have been expected, it is far from trivial to calculate the eﬀective
action, and therefore the self-energy, exactly for an arbitrary closed curve C.
Besides, one should expect the existence of inﬁnities, due to the assumption
that the defects have zero width. Those inﬁnities can nevertheless be regu-
lated by the introduction of an UV cutoﬀ which, in coordinate space, may
be regarded as a non vanishing width for the defect. In the next Section,
when dealing with the interaction between two defects, no cutoﬀ dependence
is expected in the interaction energy, since this object is independent of the
respective self-energies.

One can attempt to implement diﬀerent approximation schemes in order
to calculate Γ; the choice is determined, in the end, by the nature of the
conﬁguration being studied. The case we consider here corresponds to small-
amplitude deviations with respect to a linear defect. More precisely, we
assume that F (x) = x2 − ϕ(x1), expanding the eﬀective action in powers of
ϕ, which is the deviation with respect to the x2 = 0 straight line.

We ﬁrst note that, with this choice of F :

HI = −2m δ(x2 − ϕ(x1))(cid:0) − ϕ(cid:48)(x1)γ1 + γ2

(cid:1) ,

(15)

where a prime denotes derivative with respect to the argument. Denoting
now by Γi the order-i term in the expansion for Γ:

Γ = Γ0 + Γ1 + Γ2 + . . .

we also have the corresponding expansion for the energy:

E = E0 + E1 + E2 + . . . ,

(16)

(17)

where E0 amounts to an uninteresting inﬁnite constant independent of ϕ,
which can be interpreted as coming from a linear energy density. The di-
vergence is present already at the level of the energy density, which is cutoﬀ
dependent.

1Results for Γ are independent of the choice (inwards or outwards) for the normal.

Regarding the ﬁrst and second order terms, we see that, as a consequence
of assuming that the functional expansion exists, they can be written as
follows:

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

E1 =

dx1 E (1)(x1) ϕ(x1)

(cid:90)

7

1
2

dx1

E2 =

dy1 E (2)(x1, y1) ϕ(x1) ϕ(y1) .

(18)
Since the functional expansion coeﬃcients E (1) and E (2) are independent of
ϕ, they must be translation invariant objects. Thus, E (1) = constant and
E (2)(x1, y1) = E (2)(x1 − y1).

The ﬁrst-order term then has the form:

E1 = E (1)

dx1ϕ(x1) ;

(19)

namely, it depends only on the average value of the deformation ϕ. Since
this average value could be changed just by performing a rigid translation of
the defect along the x2 direction, and the energy cannot change under such
a shift, we conclude that E (1), and therefore E1, vanishes. We have checked
this explicitly, by evaluating Γ1, which, recalling (10), is given by:

(20)
Here, Hl consistently denotes de order-l term in an expansion of Hl. The
ones appearing here are:

The inverse of H0 is given by
(H0)−1(x, y) =

An explicit evaluation shows that the object above is quadratically divergent
in the ultraviolet, namely, introducing an UV cutoﬀ Λ,

(28)

with c a dimensionless constant, which depends upon the regularization ap-
proach. Thus, we conclude that the role of this term amounts to introducing
a mass density proportional to (mΛ)2 for the collective degree of freedom.

The remaining term, E2,2, can be evaluated and represented in Fourier

space, the result being a nonlocal quadratic functional in ϕ:

From that expression, we can extract its local piece, quadratic in deriva-

tives, which is logarithmically divergent:

which may be thought of as generating a ‘tension’ for the domain wall. Note
that the existence of an infrared divergence in the momentum integral can
only proceed from the existence of a massless ﬁeld, which we can readily
identify here as corresponding to the one predicted by the Callan and Harvey
mechanism.

3.2 Coupling to an external gauge ﬁeld
When coupling the Dirac ﬁeld to an external Abelian gauge ﬁeld Aµ, we have
to perform the following change in the operator D:
D → (cid:54) ∂ + ie (cid:54)A(x) + M (x) .

(31)
Then, assuming a rectilinear defect, the term of second order in Aµ, Γ(2)(A),
will have the structure:

Γ(2)(A) =

(32)

(cid:90)

dx2

(cid:90)

Γ(2)(A) =

(cid:90) d2k(cid:107)

It is convenient to perform a Fourier transform of the objects above with
respect to the x0 and x1 coordinates (the defect breaks translation invariance
along the x2 axis):

dy2 (cid:101)Aµ(−k(cid:107); x2)(cid:101)Πµν(k(cid:107); x2, y2) (cid:101)Aν(k(cid:107); y2)
A straightforward calculation shows that the vacuum polarization tensor(cid:101)Πµν
(cid:101)Πµν(k(cid:107); x2, y2) = − e2

S(p(cid:107); y2, x2)γµS(p(cid:107) +k(cid:107); x2, y2)γν

is given by:

with:

S(p(cid:107); x2, y2) =

G(p(cid:107); x2, y2) .

(35)

Having in mind to study the response of the system to an electric ﬁeld along

the direction and location of the defect, we consider the components (cid:101)Παβ,
(cid:2)pα(p + k)β + pβ(p + k)α − δαβp(cid:107) · (p(cid:107) + k(cid:107))(cid:3)

with α, β in the 0, 1 range, and set x2 = y2 = 0. After a rather lengthy
calculation, we see that the only surviving contributions to the vacuum po-
larization lead to:

(cid:90) d2p(cid:107)

(2π)2

(Ω(p(cid:107)) − m)(Ω(p(cid:107) + k(cid:107)) − m)

(Ω(p(cid:107)) + m)(Ω(p(cid:107) + k(cid:107)) + m)

. (36)

It can be seen that the leading contribution proceeds from the ﬁrst term on
the second line above. In particular, for large m:

which is the expression for the vacuum polarization in 1 + 1 dimensions, due
to a massless fermion ﬁeld. Thus we have veriﬁed, in a concrete example,
the presence of that mode in our treatment of the problem.

4 Two domain walls
In this section, the mass is assumed to have a purely spatial dependence, with
two domain-wall like defects, i.e., zero-width regions of space where the mass
passes through zero. One of those regions will be assumed to correspond to a
straight line, hereafter denoted by L, deﬁned by x2 = 0. The other defect, R,
is assumed to correspond to a curve which represents a small departure from
a line which is parallel to L. We assume that it can be deﬁned in terms of a
single function ϕ(x1), which speciﬁes the distance, along x2, of each point in
R to L. Thus,

M (x) = m σ(x2) σ(x2 − ϕ(x1))

(38)
where, as before, σ denotes the sign function. m is a positive constant which
deﬁnes the constant value of the absolute value of M (x), as well as half the
height of the jump in the mass at each defect.

The assumption about R being a small departure from a straight line par-
allel to L is made more precise by assuming that the above introduced func-
tion ϕ(x1) can be written as ϕ(x1) = a + η(x1), with a > 0 and |η(x1)| << a.

The eﬀective action Γ(M ), can then be expanded in powers of η,

Γ = Γ0 + Γ1 + Γ2 + . . .

(39)

where the index denotes the order in η of the corresponding term. We will
evaluate here the zeroth order, and describe the calculation of the ﬁrst and
second orders in the Appendix.

The zeroth order corresponds to setting η = 0, so that the walls L and
R will be located at x2 = 0 and x2 = a, respectively. The system has
then translation invariance along x1, as well as time independence. The
eﬀective action to this order will then diverge, since it will be proportional
to the extent of the time interval, T , and to L1, the length of the system
along x1, which should tend to inﬁnity. As usual, one can take care of that
divergence by considering the eﬀective action per unit time and per unit
length, a quantity which we shall denote by E0(a), and has the dimensions of
an energy per unit length. That quantity, a function of a and m, contains the
information about the interaction energy between the two domain walls, in
particular on the part of that function which does depend on a. Self-energy
contributions are a-independent and will be discarded. In other words, since

10

the force per unit length between L and R is proportional to (minus) the
derivative of Γ0 with respect to a, we only keep the terms which contribute
to that observable.

Γ0(a) is formally given by a functional determinant:

e−Γ0(a) = det(cid:2) (cid:54) ∂ + m(x2)(cid:3) = det(cid:2)− (cid:54) ∂ + M0(x2)(cid:3) ,
(cid:104)(cid:0)− (cid:54) ∂ + M0(x2)(cid:1)(cid:0) (cid:54) ∂ + M0(x2)(cid:1)(cid:105)(cid:111) 1

e−Γ0(a) =

Then we see, by Fourier transforming the dependence on the x0 and x1
coordinates, that:

E0(a) = lim

2 + Ω2(k(cid:107)) + 2m γ2 [δ(x2) − δ(x2 − a)] .

(43)

As expected, the problem has been reduced to the calculation of a reduced
fermionic determinant involving a non trivial dependence on x2 only. Besides,
the 2× 2 matrix structure can be straightforwardly dealt with, decomposing
the problem into two scalar ones:

(cid:90) d2k(cid:107)

(2π)2

(cid:110)
log(cid:0) − ∂2
+ log(cid:0) − ∂2

2 + Ω2(k(cid:107)) + 2m[δ(x2) − δ(x2 − a)](cid:1)
2 + Ω2(k(cid:107)) − 2m[δ(x2) − δ(x2 − a)](cid:1)(cid:111)

E0(a) = − 1
2

.
(44)

Regarding these two scalar problems, since they involve operators acting non
trivially only on one coordinate, they can be evaluated using Gelfand-Yaglom
theorem, in an identical fashion to the one presented in [11]. Following the
method applied in that reference, we get for each scalar problem, the same
contribution (each one independent of the sign of m). The expression for the
energy density thus becomes:

that can be formed with m and a. Its explicit form cannot be given in a
closed form, but nevertheless it can be written as an integral:

g(x) =

(47)
In Figure 1 we present a plot of the energy per unit area E0 as a function of the
distance between domain walls. It is a monotonous function, and produces
a force which is always attractive. We have checked numerically that E0/m2
diverges as log(ma) at short distances (ma (cid:28) 1), and vanishes exponentially
as ma exp(−2ma) in the opposite limit ma (cid:29) 1. The behavior at large
distances is typical for the vacuum interaction energy associated to massive
ﬁelds. It can also be obtained analytically by approximating Ω(k(cid:107)) ≈ m in
Eq.(45), performing the integral up to a maximum value of k(cid:107) of order m,
and then expanding the result for ma (cid:29) 1.

It is interesting to remark that the structure of the result for the vacuum
interaction energy between domain walls, Eq.(45), is similar to those obtained
for the Casimir eﬀect for massive fermions between planar boundaries [12] or
in the presence of δ-potentials [13].

We have computed the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations of a Dirac scalar
ﬁeld in 2 + 1 dimensions on domain wall defects. For a single defect, the
vacuum energy is highly divergent. We can understand the origin of the
divergences as follows. Had we considered a theory in which the fermion
ﬁeld is coupled to a dynamical scalar ﬁeld whose classical part generates
a smooth domain wall, the vacuum polarization of the fermion ﬁeld would
produce a renormalization of the mass of the scalar ﬁeld as long as a ﬁnite
correction to the mass of the domain wall.
In the present paper, there is
an additional source of divergences, because we are assuming a zero-width
domain wall. For a nonplanar wall, we have found that the vacuum energy
contains divergences that are proportional to ϕ2 and to ϕ(cid:48)2. This indicates
that in a dynamical model for the wall, there would be a renormalization of
the mass and of the tension of the defect. We have seen that, part of this
renormalization appears to be due to the ﬂuctuations of the fermionic zero
mode. We have veriﬁed this in an independent fashion, by computing the
vacuum polarization tensor on the domain wall, that the virtual eﬀects due
to this mode are, indeed, present.

For two domain walls, we have shown that vacuum energy induces a
Casimir-like force between defects. For planar walls, the force could be com-
puted using standard techniques based in the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem; the
result shows that it is always attractive. At short distances, it is inversely
proportional to the distance, while vanishes exponentially at large distances.
The divergences that occur in the vacuum energy for a single defect are not
present in the interaction energy, which is moreover unambiguously deﬁned.
We remark that, in the graphene case one should multiply our result
corresponding to the attractive force by the proper number of two-component
fermions.

We have also obtained explicit expressions for the interaction energy be-
tween a planar wall and a slightly deformed wall (see the Appendix). As for
the usual Casimir eﬀect, in this case the energy is a nonlocal functional of
the deformation.

Appendix
In this Appendix we compute the ﬁrst and second order terms in the expan-
sion of the eﬀective action given in Eq.(39).

First order
The calculation of the ﬁrst order term does not give a new result, but it
can be used as a consistency check for the previous calculation. Indeed, the
contribution of ﬁrst order in η has the form:

Γ1 = − Tr

(48)
where M1(x) = −2 m δ(x2 − a) η(x1). By taking the functional trace, after
some algebra we see that the ﬁrst order term in the energy per unit length
is:

(cid:104)(cid:0) (cid:54) ∂ + M (x2)(cid:1)−1 M1

where ‘tr’ denotes the trace over Dirac indices. On the other hand, η0 ≡

(cid:82) dx1η(x1) is the mean value of η.

(2π)2 tr

Since the previous expression depends on η only through the constant η0,
it is not sensible to the details of its local space dependence. Therefore, it
can be obtained from the zeroth order expression. Indeed, one should have
the relation:

E1 = E0(a + η0) − E0(a) + O(η2

(50)
so that the ﬁrst order term we are about to calculate should be compared
with the one obtained by evaluating the derivative of the zeroth order term
with respect to a and multiplying by η0.

(cid:104)x2|(cid:0)γ2∂2 + i (cid:54) k(cid:107) + M0(x2)(cid:1)−1|y2(cid:105) = [−γ2∂x2 − i (cid:54) k(cid:107) + M0(x2)] (cid:104)x2|K−1|y2(cid:105) ,

One can show that:

(51)
where K is the operator introduced in the calculation of the zeroth order
term.

The inverse of the scalar operator above can be obtained by using stan-
dard techniques, and the result obtained by inserting it into the expression
for the ﬁrst order term is consistent with the relation obtained between it
and the derivative of the zeroth order term.

The second order term Γ2 receives two diﬀerent contributions:

Γ2 = Γa

Γb
It may be seen that Γb
2 can, like the ﬁrst order term, be derived from the
knowledge of the zeroth order term. In other words, it is only sensitive to
the average value of η. Thus, we shall concentrate on Γa
2, since it is the only
one that contains new information to this order.

The system is now time-independent but translation invariance along x1 is
not necessarily preserved. Thus, Γa
