A NOTE ON HILBERT-KUNZ MULTIPLICITY

MOHSEN ASGHARZADEH

Abstract. In this note we ﬁrst give a new bound on eHK(∼) the Hilbert-Kunz multi-

plicity of invariant rings, by the help of the Noether’s bound. Then, we simplify, extend

and present applications of the reciprocity formulae due to L. Smith. He proved the

formula over polynomial rings and his result is tight in the following sense: Over com-

plete intersection rings with isolated singularity we show that the reciprocity formulae

”eHK(R/I) + eHK(R/J) = eHK(R/f )” is equivalent with p. dim(I) < ∞ when I is an

m-primary unmixed ideal linked to J along with a regular sequence f .

Introduction

Throughout this note rings are of prime characteristic p > 0. Let F n(−) be the Peskine-
Szpiro functor. The Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity over ∗-local (A, m) with an m-primary ideal

I is deﬁned by

eHK(I, A) := lim
n→∞

ℓ (F n(A/I))

pn dim A

.

This introduced by Kunz. Monsky proved such a limit exists [7]. Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity

encodes the singularity in prime characteristic [14], et cetera. Some times computing
eHK (∼) is diﬃcult and ﬁnding bounds may be a reasonable task. Also, eHK (∼) behaves
both similar to and diﬀerent from those of Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity. In this note we

present a new sample for this behavior.

We use eHK (A) instead of eHK (m, A). We denote the usual Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity
by e(I). Suppose a ﬁnite group G acts linearly over a polynomial ring with n variables, de-

note the invariant ring by A and assume that the order of G is prime to p. First we observe

(n−1+|G|

)

n
|G|

, as an easy application of Noether’s bound from invariant theory. Over

eHK (A) ≤
2-dimensional quotient singularity, this has in the simple form eHK(k[X, Y ]G) ≤ |G|+1
. So
e(k[X, Y ]G) ≤ |G| + 1. We show the bound is sharp in some cases but not in general. We
do this in Section 3.

Section 4 motivated by the reciprocity formulae of Larry Smith. This result connects

the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of linked ideals I and J via the complete intersection ideal

a := (f ) over polynomial rings, i.e.,

eHK (I, R) + eHK (J, R) = eHK (a, R).

We ﬁrst reprove Smith’s result by a short argument. Then we extend it from the poly-

nomial rings to more general setting. We give corollaries of this result, see e.g. Corollary

4.2.

Suppose X, Y ⊂ P3 are curves directly linked by equations of degrees d and e. It may
be worth to recall that Peskine and Szpiro proved the degrees and genus of X and Y are

related by the following formulas:

i) deg X + deg Y = de

ii) g(X) − g(Y ) = (deg X − deg Y )(d + e − 4)/2.

Up to our knowledge the above result regards as a root of liaison theory. The following is

our main result:

Theorem 1.1. Let R be a local complete intersection with isolated singularity and of posi-

tive dimension. Let I be an unmixed primary ideal linked to J via the complete intersection

ideal a := (f ) of full length. The following are equivalent.

i) eHK (I, R) + eHK(J, R) = eHK (a, R).
ii) p. dim(I) < ∞.

To prove this result, and among other things, we use the corner powers of unmixed ideals

developed by Vraciu, and we apply the theory of generalized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity that

introduced by Dao and Smirnov. In particular, the generalized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity

has a new application to the classical Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity.

2. preliminary

All rings in this note are commutative and Noetherian. Let R be a ring of prime
characteristic p. The assignment a 7→ ap deﬁnes a ring homomorphism F : R → R. By
F n(R), we mean R as a group equipped with left and right scalar multiplication from R
given by

a.r ⋆ b = abpn

r, where a, b ∈ R and r ∈ F n(R).

Now we recall the Peskine-Szpiro functor. For a ﬁnitely generated R-module M , set

F n(M ) := M ⊗ F n(R).

It is easy to see F n(R/a) = R/a
x1, . . . , xr. The ith local cohomology of M with respect to a is deﬁned by

[pn]. Let a be an ideal a with a generating set x :=

H i

a(M ) := lim
−→
n

Exti

R(R/a

n, M ).

One may calculate it as the ith cohomology of ˇCech complex of a module M with respect
to x. The grade of a on M is deﬁned by

gradeR(a, M ) := inf{i ∈ N0|H i

a(M ) 6= 0}.

We use depth(M ), when we deal with the maximal ideal of ∗-local rings. Our next auxiliary

tool is

if the limit exists and put ∞ otherwise. Following Dao and Smirnov [3], we call them

the generalized Hilbert-Kunz function and the generalized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity.
If
ℓ(M ) < ∞ we are in the situation of [7] and we use f M
HK and eHK(M ), respectively.
If there is no doubt of confusion, we use eHK(R/a) instead of eHK (a, R). We need the
following two facts:

Fact 2.1. (See [2, Proposition 8.2.5]) Frobenius map commutes with the localization, i.e.,
RS ⊗R F n(M ) ≃ F n(RS ⊗R M ) for any multiplicative closed subset S ⊂ R.

Fact 2.2. Over regular rings the Frobenius map is ﬂat, see [2, Corollary 8.2.8].

3. A bound on eHK (∼) of invariant rings

Throughout this section R := Ln≥0 Rn is a standard graded algebra of a ﬁeld R0 := k

of prime characteristic p > 0 and m := Ln>0 Rn is the irrelevant ideal.

Notation 3.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group such that |G| is invertible in the ﬁeld k, i.e.,

(p, |G|) = 1.

Discussion 3.2. Let A be a ring and ρ : G → Aut(A) be a representation of ﬁnite group G

by Aut(A) and |G| is invertible in A. Recall that a ⊂ A is said to be G-stable, if g(a) ∈ a

for all g ∈ G and a ∈ a. For any subset X ⊂ A by XA, we mean the ideal generated by

X.

Let us recall the following version of Noether’s bound due to D. Benson:

Lemma 3.3. (See [8, Lemma 2.3.1]) Adopt the above notation and let a be G-stable. Then
|G| ⊆ (a
a

G)A.

Suppose G acts on R by degree-preserving k-algebra homomorphisms. This means that

g(Rn) ⊆ Rn for all g ∈ G and n ∈ N. Then

A := RG = {f ∈ R : g(f ) = f

∀g ∈ G}

is the ring of invariants. Denote Li>0 Ai by n. Recall from [14] that:

Fact 3.4. eHK(A) = dim(R/nR)

|G|

.

Proposition 3.5. Adopt the above notation. Then eHK (A) ≤

(n−1+|G|

n
|G|

)

.

Proof. As G acts on R by degree-preserving k-algebra homomorphisms, m is G-stable. In

view of Lemma 3.3, m

|G| ⊆ (m

G)R. Also, (m

G)R ⊆ nR. Thus,

|G| ⊆ (m

G)R ⊆ nR.

Therefore, in view of Fact 3.4,

eHK (A) ≤

.

Corollary 3.6. Over 2-dimensional invariant rings, one has:

i) eHK (k[X, Y ]G) ≤ |G|+1
ii) e(k[X, Y ]G) ≤ |G| + 1.

2

(cid:3)

Proof. Set n = 2 in Proposition 3.5. Part i) is now immediate. For part ii) we recall a

result of Monsky [7], i.e., over any ring A one observes

e(A)/(dim A)! ≤ eHK (A).

Combining this along with i) we get the claim.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.7. Suppose |G| = 2. One has

i) eHK (RG) ≤ dim R+1
ii) e(RG) ≤ (dim R+1)!
.

.

Let us show these bounds are sharp.

Example 3.8. Suppose |G| = 2 and n = 2. Denote the corresponding invariant ring by A.

We assume that A is not regular and such a thing happens. Then we get

e(A)
(dim A)! ≤ eHK(A) ≤

2

(∗)

As the ring A is not regular, eHK (A) > 1. This along with (∗) yields:

i) eHK (A) = 3/2;
ii) e(A) = 3.

4. Smith’s reciprocity formulae

Recall that I is linked to J if there is a regular sequence f := f1, . . . , fi in I ∩ J such
that I = (f : J) and J = (f : I). Smith proved a reciprocity formulae over polynomial

rings [12, Theorem 5.7]. First, we extend his result to Gorenstein rings by a new and short

argument.

A NOTE ON HILBERT-KUNZ MULTIPLICITY

5

Proposition 4.1. Let R be a d-dimensional Gorenstein ring, I and J primary to the
maximal ideal m linked via a regular sequence f := f1, . . . , fd. Then

ℓ(R/I) + ℓ(R/J) = ℓ(R/f ).

Proof. Note that

ℓ(R/I) + ℓ(R/J)

where:

1) Since R/I is of ﬁnite length.

2) This is the local duality.

m(R/I)) + ℓ(R/J)

1
= ℓ(H 0
2= ℓ(Extd
3
= ℓ(Ext0
4
= ℓ(J/f ) + ℓ(R/J)
5= ℓ(R/f ),

R(R/I, R)) + ℓ(R/J)
R(R/I, R/f )) + ℓ(R/J)

3) Keep in mind that f is a regular sequence in the Jacobson radical of the ring. An

easy induction implies that

Ext0

R(R/I, R/f ) ≃ Extd

R(R/I, R).

4) This is in the deﬁnition of linked ideals.

5) This follows by the following short exact sequence:

0 −→ J/f −→ R/f −→ R/J −→ 0.

The proof is now complete.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.2. Let (R, m) be a Gorenstein local ring of dimension zero with an ideal I

in which (0 : I) = I. Then ℓ(R) ∈ 2N.

Proof. As (0 : I) = I, we get that

2ℓ(R/I) = ℓ(H 0

m(R/I)) + ℓ(R/(0 : I))

= ℓ(HomR(R/I, R)) + ℓ(R/(0 : I))
= ℓ((0 : I)) + ℓ(R/(0 : I))

= ℓ(R).

So, ℓ(R) ∈ 2N.

(cid:3)

Example 4.3. (i) Here we remark that the length of a zero-dimensional Gorenstein local
ring can be every thing, e.g., K[X]/(X n). To see examples of high embedding dimension,
look at the zero-dimensional Gorenstein ring

R := K[X1, . . . , Xn]/(X 2

1 − X 2

2 , . . . , X 2

1 − X 2

n, X1X2, X1X3, . . . , Xn−1Xn).

So, {1, X1, . . . , Xn, X 2

1 } is a base for R and {X1, . . . , Xn} is a base for m/m

2.

(ii) Let (R, m, K) be a Gorenstein local ring containing a ﬁeld with m

2 = 0. By this
property, (0 : m) = m. In view of the above Corollary, ℓ(R) ∈ 2N. Let us check this by

6

ASGHARZADEH

hand. As R is Gorenstein, its socle is principal. Therefore, m is principal. Denote its
generator by r. The assignment r 7→ X yields R ≃ K[X]/(X 2). In particular, ℓ(R) = 2
as claimed.

Remark 4.4. (See [6, Example 6.6]) The concept of numerically Roberts rings introduced

in [6]. Suppose R is a homomorphic image of a regular local ring and let d = dim R. The

following are numerically Roberts rings:

i) d < 2

ii) d = 2 and R is equi-dimensional.

iii) d = 3 and R is Gorenstien.

The following extends [12, Corollary 5.8] via a new argument.

Corollary 4.5. Let R be a d-dimensional Gorenstein ring, I and J be two ideals of ﬁnite
projective dimension linked through a regular sequence f := f1, . . . , fd. Assume one of the
following holds:

i) Suppose in addition, R is standard graded over a ﬁeld, I and J are homogenous.

ii) Suppose in addition, R is a local complete intersection ring.

iii) Suppose in addition, R is local and dim R < 4.

Then eHK (I, R) + eHK (J, R) = eHK(f , R).

Proof. i) Recall that over a graded ring of dimension d with a graded module M of ﬁnite

length and of ﬁnite projective dimension, a celebrated result of Peskine and Szpiro says:

ℓ(F n(M )) = pndℓ(M ).*

In particular, eHK(I, R) = ℓ(R/I). Now, Proposition 4.1 proves the desired claim.

ii) First we note that p. dim(R/f ) < ∞. Any complete intersection ring is a numerically

Roberts ring. In view of [6, Theorem 6.4], the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of an ideal primary

to the maximal ideal and of ﬁnite projective dimension is its colength. Now, Proposition

4.1 proves the desired claim.

iii) In view of the above Remark this follows in a similar vein as ii).

(cid:3)

Recall that a module M is called generalized Cohen-Macaulay if H i

m(M ) is ﬁnitely

generated for all i < dim M . Recall from [3]:

Deﬁnition 4.6. Let M be generalized Cohen-Macaulay and i < dim M . The i-th gener-

alized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of M is

ei
gHK(M ) := lim
n→∞

ℓ (cid:0)H i

m(F n(M ))(cid:1)
pn dim R

,

if it exists and put ∞ otherwise.

*There are 3-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay rings of characteristic p such that ℓ(F n(M )) 6= p3nℓ(M ), for

a suitable module of ﬁnite length, by [11].

A NOTE ON HILBERT-KUNZ MULTIPLICITY

7

Remark 4.7. Let R be a regular ring and M a module of ﬁnite length. Then F n(M ) is of
ﬁnite length. Indeed, we do induction by ℓ := ℓ(M ). If ℓ = 1, then M = R/m and the

claim is clear in this case. Now suppose, inductively, that ℓ > 1 and the result has been

proved for modules of length less than ℓ. Look at the exact sequence

0 −→ N −→ M −→ R/m −→ 0

where ℓ(N ) = ℓ − 1. By inductive hypothesis F n(N ) is of ﬁnite length. By Fact 2.2, there
is an exact sequence

0 −→ F n(N ) −→ F n(M ) −→ F n(R/m) −→ 0.

The claim is now clear.

Proposition 4.8. Let R be a regular ring of dimension d, I and J be two ideals linked
via a regular sequence f := f1, . . . , fg for some g < d. Suppose in addition that R/I is
generalized Cohen-Macaulay of dimension m. Then for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 one has

gHK(R/I) = em−i
ei

gHK(R/J).

Proof. Set f pn

:= f pn

g . As R is regular, the Frobenius map is ﬂat. Hence

1 , . . . , f pn
: J [pn]),
: I [pn]) and

1) I [pn] = (f pn
2) J [pn] = (f pn
3) f pn

is a regular sequence.

Thus I [pn] and J [pn] are linked through f pn
. As Supp(F n(M )) = Supp(M )), one has
dim(F n(M )) = dim(M ). In particular, dim R/I [pn] = m. Also, exact functors commute
with the local cohomology modules. By the above Remark, Fact 2.2 and in view of

F n(H i

m(R/I)) ≃ H i

m(F n(R/I)) ≃ H i

m(R/I [pn]),

we observe that H i
view of [13, Corollary 3.3],

m(R/I [pn]) is ﬁnitely generated for all i < m. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1. In

H i

m(R/I [pn]) ≃ Hom(H m−i

m (R/J [pn]), E).

So,

ℓ(H i

m(R/I [pn])) = ℓ(H m−i

m (R/J [pn])).

This yields ei

gHK (R/I) = em−i

gHK (R/J) as claimed.

(cid:3)

We cite the next result for the convenience of the reader.

Lemma 4.9. (Avramov-Miller, Dutta) Let R be a local complete intersection and M a
ﬁnitely generated R-module. Then the vanishing of Tori
R(M, F n(R)) for one value each of
i > 0 and n > 0 implies that M has ﬁnite projective dimension.

ASGHARZADEH

Let (R, m) be a characteristic p Gorenstein ring. If I ⊳ R is an unmixed ideal of height

g, let a ⊂ I be a Gorenstein ideal of ﬁnite projective dimension and of height g (e.g.,

a parameter ideal), and let J := (a : I). Now, by the help of [15, Proposition 1], the

following is well-deﬁne:

Notation 4.10. Following [15], deﬁne I <q> := (a

[q] : J [q]) for all q = pn.

Lemma 4.11. Let (R, m) be a ring of prime characteristic p, let I be an unmixed ideal
and q = pn. The following holds:

i) If R is Gorenstein, I [q] ⊆ I <q> ∀q and the equality holds when p. dim(I) < ∞.
ii) Suppose R is complete intersection. Then I [q] = I <q>∀q ⇔ p. dim(I) < ∞.
iii) Suppose R is complete intersection. Then I [q] = I <q>∃q ⇔ p. dim(I) < ∞.

Proof. i): This is in [15, Proposition 2].

ii): First note that complete intersection rings are Gorenstein. The desired claim is in

[15, Proposition 2] when the ring is hypersurface. Here, we sketch that proof. Let N be
the cokernel of the natural inclusion R/I ֒→ ⊕nR/a deﬁned via the matrix (f1, . . . , fn).
Vraciu’s main trick is as follows:

I <q>/I [q] = TorR

1 (N, F n(R))

(∗),

see the proof of [15, Proposition 2]. Now, suppose I <q> = I [q]. Apply this throughout
the complete intersection property to conclude that TorR
1 (N, F n(R)) = 0. So, Lemma 4.9
implies that p. dimR(N ) < ∞. By deﬁnition of N , we observe p. dimR(R/I) < ∞.

iii) This is similar to ii).

(cid:3)

In what follows we will use the following two results on the concept of generalized

Hilbert-Kunz functions.

Lemma 4.12. (See [3, Corollary 4.7]) Let R be a local complete intersection with isolated

singularity. The following are equivalent:

i) egHK(M ) = 0,
ii) f M
iii) p. dimR M < dim R.

gHK(n) = 0 for all n,

Lemma 4.13. (See [3, Lemma 3.10]) Let R be a formally equi-dimensional local ring of
positive depth, then H 0

1 (M, F n(R))(cid:1) = H 0

m(Syz(M )).

m (cid:0)TorR

Corollary 4.14. Suppose in addition to Lemma 4.13, R has isolated singularity. Then

TorR

1 (M, F n(R)) = H 0

m(Syz(M )).

Proof. It is enough to show TorR

1 (M, F n(R)) is of ﬁnite length. Equivalently,

TorR

1 (M, F n(R))p = 0 ∀p 6= m.

A NOTE ON HILBERT-KUNZ MULTIPLICITY

9

Let p be a non-maximal prime ideal. Due to Fact 2.2 and the isolated singularity,

TorRp

1 (∼, F n(Rp)) = 0.

By Fact 2.1,

TorR

1 (M, F n(R))p ≃ TorRp

1 (Mp, F n(Rp)) = 0,

and this completes the argument.

(cid:3)

Now we are ready to prove the following:

Theorem 4.15. Let R be a local complete intersection with isolated singularity and of

positive dimension. Let I be an unmixed ideal linked to J throughout a regular sequence f

of full length. The following are equivalent:

i) eHK (I, R) + eHK(J, R) = eHK (f , R),
ii) p. dim(I) < ∞.

Proof. i) ⇒ ii): First we remark that any Cohen-Macaulay ring is formally equidimen-

sional. Suppose on the contrary that p. dim(I) = ∞. Let d := dim R. Let N be the
cokernel of the natural inclusion R/I ֒→ ⊕dR/a deﬁned via the matrix (f1, . . . , fd). Then
by Lemma 4.11,

0 6= I <q>/I [q] = TorR

1 (N, F n(R)).

On the other hand by Corollary 4.14

ℓ (cid:0)TorR

1 (N, F n(R))(cid:1) = f Syz(N )

gHK (n).

We note that p. dim(N ) = ∞ and the same thing holds for its syzygies. By Lemma 4.12,

lim
n→∞

ℓ(I <q>/I [q])

qd

6= 0.

In the light of [15, Proposition 3] we observe

ℓ(R/I <q>) + ℓ(R/J [q]) = ℓ(R/f [q]).

Putting this along with i) we get that

lim
n→∞

ℓ(I <q>/I [q])

qd

= 0,

a contradiction.

ii) ⇒ i): This is in Corollary 4.5.
