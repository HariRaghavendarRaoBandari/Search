The conventional Josephson effect may be modiﬁed
by introducing spin-active scattering in the interface-
layer of the junction. Here, we discuss a Josephson
junction consisting of two s-wave superconducting
leads coupled over a classical spin that precesses
with the Larmor frequency due to an external
magnetic ﬁeld. This magnetically active interface
results in a time-dependent boundary condition
with different
tunnelling amplitudes for spin-up
and -down quasiparticles and where the precession
produces spin-ﬂip scattering processes. As a result,
the Andreev states develop sidebands and a non-
equilibrium population that depend on the details of
the spin precession. The Andreev states carry a steady-
state Josephson charge current and a time-dependent
spin current, whose current-phase relations could
be used for characterising the precessing spin. The
spin current is supported by spin-triplet correlations
induced by the spin precession and creates a feed-back
effect on the classical spin in the form of a torque that
shifts the precession frequency.

By applying a bias voltage, the Josephson frequency
adds another complexity to the situation and may
create resonances together with the Larmor frequency.
These Shapiro resonances are manifested as torques
and are, under suitable conditions, able to reverse the
direction of the classical spin in sub-nanosecond time.
Another characteristic feature is the subharmonic gap
structure in the dc charge current displaying an even-
odd effect that is attributable to precession-assisted
multiple Andreev reﬂections.

1. Introduction
Interesting spin phenomena may occur when ferromagnets are combined with superconductors
(see [1] and [2] and references therein). Cooper pairs in a conventional superconductor have spin-
singlet pairing which, if the superconductor is interfaced with a ferromagnet, extend into the
ferromagnet. However, the exchange ﬁeld inside the ferromagnet tries to align the two spins
of the Cooper pairs and hence breaks the Cooper pairs apart resulting in a rapid decay of the
superconducting correlations inside the ferromagnet. For the same reasons, the critical current of
a Josephson junction with a ferromagnetic layer sandwiched between the two superconductors
decays rapidly with increasing thickness of the ferromagnetic layer [3–6]. On the other hand,
if weak ferromagnetic interfaces with magnetisation directions differing from the magnetisation
direction of the ferromagnetic layer are inserted, the spin-singlet correlations may be transformed
into spin-triplet correlations which can survive over a long range within the ferromagnet layer
[7–11]. As a result of this non-collinear magnetisation of the ferromagnetic layer, the critical
current decays similarly to a supercurrent in a non-magnetic metal with increasing junction
length [12,13]. So far, the existence of spin-triplet correlations has been measured in this indirect
way. A more direct way of detecting the spin-triplet correlations would be to measure the effects of
the spin on the triplet correlations, e.g. by using phenomena explored in conventional spintronics
such as spin-transfer torques and other means for creating magnetisation dynamics effects or
magnetisation switching. There has been theoretical work done in this direction [14–16] using
approaches based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations [17–21] and Green’s function methods
[22–27] as well as some experimental work investigating the coupling between the dynamics
of magnetic moments and Josephson currents [28,29], but to our knowledge there has been no
experimental investigation of the coupling between magnetisation dynamics and induced triplet
correlations. This is a crucial step in developing superconducting spintronics applications [2]. In
this article, we will review recent work on how magnetisation dynamics of a nanomagnet couple
to the induced spin-triplet correlations associated with the charge and spin Josephson effects,
and discuss how the dynamic interactions between the induced spin-triplet correlations and the
nanomagnet lead to non-equilibrium transport properties that can be used to probe the induced
triplet correlations directly.

2. Quasiclassical model
Consider two ordinary BCS s-wave superconductors, with a phase difference ϕ, coupled over a
nanomagnet as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The nanomagnet may be a magnetic molecule or a magnetic
nanoparticle which we will treat as a classical spin, S, with magnetic moment µ = γS, and the
gyromagnetic ratio γ. The nanoparticle supports a few conduction channels when placed between
the two metallic leads. If the nanomagnet is subjected to an external magnetic ﬁeld, H, it will
precess when the effective ﬁeld is applied at an angle, ϑ, relative to the spin. H is an effective
ﬁeld that includes any r.f. ﬁelds needed to maintain precession, crystal anisotropy ﬁelds and
demagnetisation effects. The spin and the effective magnetic ﬁeld couple via a Zeeman term,
HB = −γS(t) · H. At ﬁnite tilt angle, ϑ, the spin precesses with the Larmor frequency, ωL = γH,
where H = |H| is the magnitude of the effective ﬁeld. The spin dynamics are described by the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion [30,31]

= −γS(t) × H + τ (t),

dS
dt

(2.1)

where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the torque produced by the effective ﬁeld and the
second term, τ (t), is a torque that collects effects caused by the mutual coupling between the
precessing nanomagnet and the superconducting quasiparticle system.
The coupling of the motion of the spin and the quasiparticle tunnelling over the spin enters
†
via a time-dependent tunnelling term, ˆHT = ˆψ
LˆvLR(t) ˆψR + H.C., where ˆψα is the usual spin-
dependent Nambu-spinor that describes the superconducting state in lead α = R, L. The hopping

†
RL(t) ≡ ˆv(t)) has a spin-structure that may be parametrised into a spin-
matrix ˆvLR(t) (= ˆv
independent amplitude vo and a spin-dependent amplitude vs(t). It has the following matrix
structure in the combined 4 × 4 Nambu-spin space,

ˆvLR(t) =

vo + vs(eS(t) ·σ)

vo − vsσy(eS(t) ·σ)σy

We use the time-dependent unit vector, eS(t), along S(t) = |S|eS(t) and include the magnitude
|S| in the spin-dependent amplitude vs. Above, σ = (σx, σy, σz) with σi being the i-th Pauli
matrix. The spin-independent amplitude and the portion of the spin-matrix parallel to H, vo +
vs cos ϑ (ez·σ), describe the tunnelling amplitudes for spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles,
while the portion perpendicular to H, vs sin ϑ (cos(ωLt)ex + sin(ωLt)ey)·σ,
induces time-
dependent spin ﬂips. Our model is a generalisation to arbitrary tunnelling coupling of the one
studied by Zhu and co-workers [25,32].

We use the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity [33–36] to solve the non-equilibrium
tunnelling problem stated above. Within quasiclassical theory, interfaces are handled by the

Figure 1. (a) Two superconducting leads are coupled over the spin of a nanomagnet. The tunnel junction is characterised
by the hopping amplitudes vo and vs(t), where vo is the spin-independent tunnelling and vs(t) is the phenomenological
time-dependent coupling generated by the nanomagnet, whose spin precesses with the frequency ωL at the cone
angle ϑ. (b) The schematics of conventional Andreev scattering between two superconductors at phase difference ϕ.
Constructive interference occurs at a phase-dependent energy ε(ϕ) deﬁning two energy-degenerate Andreev levels. (c)
In addition to the spin-conserving tunnelling (solid lines), the dynamics of the spin allows for tunneling processes with
spin-ﬂip scattering combined with an absorption or emission of the energy ωL (dashed lines). The combination of these
tunnelling processes results in a lifting of the spin-degeneracy of the Andreev levels in (b) and the appearance of time-
dependent spin-triplet pairing amplitudes. (d) For a junction with a static spin, the Andreev-level spectrum’s dependence
on phase may be modiﬁed from a 0 junction, vo > vs, to a π junction, vo < vs. The black full line is (vo, vs) = (1, 0)
and the red line is (vo, vs) = (0, 1). The dashed lines span between these two limits in increments of 0.1.

[37–46]. In many problems, in particular when an explicit time dependence appears, we ﬁnd
the t-matrix formulation more convenient to use [47–49]. This formulation is also well suited
for studying interfaces with different numbers of trajectories on either side as is the case for
normal metal/half metal interfaces [50,51]. For a full account on how to solve the time-dependent
boundary condition we refer to our original articles [52–55].
The quasiclassical propagator in lead α, ˇgα, is a 2 × 2 matrix in Keldysh space, denoted by the
check "ˇ". Each component is in turn a 4 × 4 matrix in the combined Nambu-spin space and has

0.1π/2, (e-h) ϑ = π/4, and (i-l) ϑ = π/2. The tunnelling parameters are vo = 0, vs = 1 and the temperature is T =

(DoS) at ϕ = 0 in (c,g,k) [53]. The current-phase relations, jc(ϕ), and the charge current kernels, jc,<(ε, ϕ), are shown
in panels (d,h,l) [53]. jc,<(ε, ϕ) shows how the Andreev levels in (b,f,j) are populated and in which direction they carry
current; red into the right and blue into the left lead. At some phase differences ϕc < ϕ < 2π − ϕc, scattering between
the Andreev levels and the continuum states broadens the otherwise sharp in-gap states. The charge current (plotted in
units of e∆/) is the energy-integrated spectral current and displays abrupt jumps at phase differences where Andreev
levels become populated/unpopulated. The DoS at ϕ = 0 shows the splitting of the spin-up and spin-down Andreev levels
as well as the scattering of the continuum levels into the gap.

3. Andreev-reﬂection-induced spin torques
Quasiparticle scattering in a Josephson junction may lead to the formation of Andreev levels if the
scattering occurs in such that a way that the quasiparticles interfere constructively (see Fig. 1(b)).
In the presence of a precessing spin, the quasiparticle scattering is modiﬁed by processes shown
in Fig. 1(c); a tunnelling quasiparticle may gain (lose) energy ωL while simultaneously ﬂipping its
spin from down (up) to up (down). The Andreev level spectrum essentially depends on the ratio
between the hopping amplitudes, vo/vs. If vo/vs < (>)1, the junction is in a π(0) state [52,53], see

An s-wave superconductor contains only spin-singlet correlations ∼ 1

Fig. 1(d). The additional precession-induced tunnelling processes modify the Andreev levels. The
Larmor frequency, ωL, determines the amount of energy exchanged during a tunnelling event,
while the cone angle, ϑ, determines the amount of scattering between the spin-up and -down
bands. These parameters, as well as the temperature, determine the population of the Andreev
states [53,54]. In Figure 2, we summarise how the tunnelling over a precessing spin modiﬁes
the Andreev spectra by introducing scattering resonances created by the combination of quanta
exchange of ωL and spin ﬂips. The charge current is time-independent but still dependent on
both ωL and ϑ as seen in Fig. 2. While the Josephson effect over the precessing spin is interesting
in its own right, we will not discuss the current-phase relations further in this paper and refer the
interested reader to the original articles [52–54]. Instead, we will focus on the effects of dynamic
spin-triplet correlations and their consequences.

due to spin mixing and locally broken spin-rotation symmetry [11,26,60]. The rotation of the
classical spin generates new spinful correlations and spin currents that are created by the Andreev
processes depicted in ﬁgure 1(b-c); positive interference along closed loops leads to the spin-
2(cid:104)ψ↑ψ↓ + ψ↓ψ↑(cid:105), (cid:104)ψ↑ψ↑(cid:105) and (cid:104)ψ↓ψ↓(cid:105). These correlations depend on the
triplet correlations 1
characteristics of the tunnelling interface, i.e. the precession frequency, ωL, the cone angle, ϑ, the
relative amplitude of hopping strengths, vo, vs, as well as the superconducting phase difference
ϕ, and the temperature, T . These spin-triplet correlations are localised near the junction interface
and decay over length scales on the order of the superconducting coherence length [43,61].

where f <(±ˆk, ε) denotes the anomalous Green’s functions at the Fermi-surface points ±ˆk. ψ(ˆk) is
a measure of the (singlet) pairing correlations available to form a singlet order parameter ∆s(ˆk) =
λsη(ˆk)(cid:104)η(ˆk(cid:48))ψ(ˆk(cid:48))(cid:105)ˆk(cid:48)·ˆn>0, where η(ˆk) = η(−ˆk) are basis functions of even parity on which the
pairing interaction may be expanded and ˆn is the direction of the surface normal. The energy εc is
the usual cut-off that appears in the BCS gap equation. The triplet correlations span the spin space

been realised in superconductor/inhomogeneous magnet interfaces [64]. The time-dependence

values of vo, the universal scaling disappears and the d-vector components display an asymmetry
between d↑ and d↓. For temperatures T /Tc (cid:46) 0.1, the d vector can be expressed in terms of the

It is then clear that the existence of the spin currents, js
α (ε, t)]}, are a direct consequence of the precession-induced spin-triplet correlations. See also
ˆgo,K
Appendix in Ref. [54]. Unfortunately, the spin currents decay over relatively short distances, viz.
the superconducting coherence length, and are therefore difﬁcult to measure. The spin current is
nothing but transport of spin-angular momentum and the non-conservation of the spin current
results in a torque acting on the rotating spin thereby creating a back-action on the precessing
spin that is sufﬁciently large for experimental detection [53], as will be described below.

Since js

L(t, ϕ), the difference between the spin currents can be used to
calculate the torque τ (t) in Eq. (2.1). We call this torque the Andreev torque since it has its origin
in the Andreev scattering processes described in Fig. 1. The torque contribution per conduction
channel is

This torque describes a shift of the precession frequency, ωL → ωL[1 + 2
shift is therefore a direct consequence of the induced spin-triplet correlations.
A measurement of this frequency shift is a measurement of the induced spin-triplet
correlations. Since the shift is ∝ 1/S, we suggest a nanomagnet with a spin that is small, but still
large enough to be treated as a classical spin, say a magnetic nanoparticle with spin S ∼ 50. For a
contact with two superconducting niobium (Nb) leads, the effective contact area is ∼ πξ2
0, where
the superconducting coherence length ξ0 ∼ 40 nm for Nb. A contact width of ∼ 40 nm contains
n ∼ 200 conduction channels. In bulk Nb, ∆ ∼ 1 meV, but can be made considerably smaller in
the point contact, say ∆ ∼ 200 µeV. We can now study the changes to the precession due to
the Andreev torque. In a typical FMR experiment, the resonance peak in the power absorption
spectrum has a width that is produced by inhomogeneous broadening, e.g. from anisotropy
ﬁelds, and homogeneous broadening, which is due to Gilbert damping, and can be expressed
S nαDs is the Gilbert constant [30]. A
as ∆Hhom = 2√
typical magnetic ﬁeld is H ∼ 180 mT, which corresponds to a Larmor precession of ∼ 20 µeV
or 5 GHz. Here, we have assumed a uniform precessional motion. In Ref. [53], it was shown
that the normal quasiparticles freeze out as the temperature is lowered. This process results in
a decrease of the width of the resonance peak [66]. For a junction with Ds ∼ 0.1, the difference
in homogeneous broadening is on the order of ∆Hhom(T /Tc > 1) − ∆Hhom(T /Tc → 0) ∼ 80 mT.
In addition to the resonance peak width reduction, the shift of the resonance peak H0 due to
the Andreev torque appears. The frequency shift corresponds to ∆ωL/ωL = αGβH cos ϑ. In the
tunnel limit, βH ∼ 1
ωL
∆ in the low temperature limit [53]. In this limit, a spin with angle ϑ = π/4
can hence generate a displacement of the resonance peak by ∆H0/H0 ∼ 2%. By increasing the
junction transparency, the ratio n/S, or the ratio ωL/∆, the ratio ∆H0/H0 can be improved.

2eV /. The replacement causes the phase difference to increase linearly in time, ϕ(t) = ϕ0 + ωJ t,
where ϕ0 is the initial phase difference. The bias voltage in combination with energy exchange
with the precessing spin creates multiple Andreev reﬂection (MAR) processes that lead to
characteristic signatures in the charge current-voltage characteristics [47,67–69]. Two examples
of spin-precession-assisted MAR are shown in Fig. 3. Similarly to the phase-biased case, energy
absorption (emission) corresponds to spin ﬂip from down (up) to up (down). The ﬁrst-order
process shown in Fig. 3(b), which includes an energy absorption of ωL, leads to a contribution to
the IV characteristics at the energy eV = 2∆ − ωL. Fig. 3(c) shows the two possible second-order
processes that include absorption of energy. The spin ﬂip associated with the energy exchange
introduces a minus sign in the next Andreev-reﬂection amplitude due to the change between

the spinors (ψ↑, ψ
suppression of the total Andreev reﬂection. Destructive interference occurs for all even processes,
n = 2, 4, ..., while higher-order odd processes display constructive interference.

The bias voltage makes the calculations of the charge and spin currents considerably more
complicated. This complication arises in large due to the MAR processes, which make it
impossible to express the Green’s functions using a closed set of equations. Instead, a recursive
approach, see Ref. [55] for details, has to be used. The general time dependence of a general matrix
such as ˇX(t, t(cid:48)) in Eq. (2.8) now has to be complemented by the time dependence generated by
the Josephson frequency. In general, the current is given by

where we have deﬁned ˆκ0 = eˆτ3 for the charge current and ˆκi = diag(σi, σyσiσy)/2 for a spin
current with a polarisation in the i = x, y, z direction. Note that just as the current depends on the
initial phase ϕ0, it also depends on χ0, which is the initial value of the in-plane projection of the
precessing spin. The integer m takes the values {−1, 0, 1} corresponding to {↓, d,↑} in Eq. (2.8).
Deﬁning v↑/↓ = vo ± vs cos ϑ, we write D↑(↓) = 4v2↑(↓)/[1 + v2↑(↓)]2.

The dc charge current and the differential conductance, plotted in Fig. 3(d), clearly show the
contributions to the current generated by the spin-precession-assisted MAR processes. These
features appear at voltages eV = (2∆ ± ωL)/n, where n = 1, 3, ... Note that, as expected, the
contributions for the even processes n = 2, 4, ... are absent. It can be shown that the ac charge
current only includes harmonics of ωJ , i.e. j0
n. This time dependence
is an effect of the combined energy exchange-spin ﬂip tunnelling processes.

The spin current, on the other hand, includes all harmonics of the Larmor and Josephson
frequencies. This time dependence is captured by the spin-transfer torque, whose ωL dependence
is described by the expression

where the prefactors, γH/L, oscillate with the Josephson frequency, γH/L(t) =(cid:80)

n γH/L,neinωJ t.
The component γL,0 describes a ﬁnite shift of the precession angle ϑ, while the term ∝ γH,0 signals
a shift of the precession frequency. The damping-like torque ∝ γL,n and the ﬁeld-like torque ∝
γH,n describe Josephson nutations [70] and oscillations of the precession frequency, respectively.
Since the torque (4.3) includes harmonics of both ωJ and ωL, resonances may occur when the
two frequencies are commensurate. These Shapiro resonances occur at the bias voltage V m
n =
−(m/n)ωL/2e where n, m (cid:54)= 0, and results in a dc contribution to the spin-transfer torque and
can be seen as a rectiﬁcation of the higher harmonics of the torque in section 3. As the ac part
of the torque (4.3) originates from an in-plane spin-polarised current, one can then conclude that
the Shapiro resonances produce dc in-plane torque components. The Shapiro resonances hence
break the rotational symmetry around the z axis and, therefore, the Shapiro torque depends on
the initial angle of nanomagnet’s magnetisation direction, χ0. This situation is analogous to the
ϕ0-dependence for the Shapiro steps seen in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions [71–73].
The dc Shapiro torque will cause the spin to precess around a new z axis. Choosing suitable
parameters and applying a self-consistent solution, one ﬁnds that the Shapiro torque is able
to reverse the spin’s direction. To this end, we choose n = 1 and optimise the effect of the
Shapiro torque by maximising the ratio γH,1/γL,1. It was found in Ref. [55] that γH,1 strongly
depends on the junction transparency but exhibits a weak dependence on the precession angle.
We therefore choose vo = 0, vs = 0.7, and ϑ = 0.1π. We consider a tunnel junction consisting of
Nb having a superconducting gap ∆ ∼ 0.5 meV and containing a magnetic nanoparticle with
spin S ∼ 50 with a typical frequency ωL ∼ 5 GHz that corresponds to a magnetic ﬁeld well
below the critical magnetic ﬁeld. We therefore have ωL/∆ = 0.01. A magnetic ﬁeld close to the
critical magnetic ﬁeld reduces ∆ and increases the resolution of features depending on the ratio
ωL/∆, e.g. the subgap features in the dc charge current. A point contact of width ∼ 40 nm has
∼ 200 conduction channels, which gives an estimated sub-nanosecond switching time for the ﬁrst
Shapiro resonance.

5. Conclusion
We have reviewed recent work on how the magnetisation dynamics of a nanomagnet couple to
the charge and spin Josephson effects. The precession of the nanomagnet modiﬁes the Andreev
scattering in several ways. First, it introduces a spin-polarised Andreev level spectrum and

dynamical spin-triplet pairing correlations in the vicinity of the junction. Second, it couples in-gap
Andreev levels with the continuum part of the spectrum causing a nonequilibrium population
of the Andreev levels. Third, it creates a nonequilibrium population of the Andreev levels,
leading to Andreev levels carrying current in opposite directions being populated and a strongly
modiﬁed current-phase relation. We have focused on the consequences of the spin-polarised
Andreev-level spectra and how they couple back to the precession dynamics of the nanomagnet
via conservation of spin-angular momentum. Depending on if the Josephson junction is phase
biased or voltage biased, the this torque can modify the precession frequency, either by a
frequency shift or by frequency modulations, or it can introduce nutations. Recent experiments on
superconductor/ferromagnet nanojunctions can extract the microscopic details of the scattering
and match junction parameters such as spin-ﬁltering and spin-mixing effects [74–76]. If the
ferromagnetic part of the junction would be a single domain magnetic grain, properties described
in this review could be probed in experiments.
