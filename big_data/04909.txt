ABSTRACT
The absence of intrinsic broad line emission has been reported in a number of active
galactic nuclei (AGN), including some with high Eddington ratios. Such “true type
2 AGN” are inherent to the disk-wind scenario for the broad line region: Broad line
emission requires a minimal column density, implying a minimal outﬂow rate and thus
a minimal accretion rate. Here we perform a detailed analysis of the consequences of
mass conservation in the process of accretion through a central disk. The resulting
constraints on luminosity are consistent with all the cases where claimed detections of
true type 2 AGN pass stringent criteria, and predict that intrinsic broad line emission
can disappear at luminosities as high as ∼4×1046 erg s−1 and any Eddington ratio,
though more detections can be expected at Eddington ratios below ∼1%. Our results
are applicable to every disk outﬂow model, whatever its details and whether clumpy or
smooth, irrespective of the wind structure and its underlying dynamics. While other
factors, such as changes in spectral energy distribution or covering factor, can aﬀect
the intensities of broad emission lines, within this scenario they can only produce true
type 2 AGN of higher luminosity then those prescribed by mass conservation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although AGN uniﬁcation is supported by a large body of
evidence, it is still incomplete in several ways. In the stan-
dard uniﬁcation scenario, all AGN are intrinsically the same,
except for their luminosity, and produce the same broad
emission line spectrum. The only reason we do not observe
the broad emission lines in type 2 AGN is our viewing angle
with respect to the toroidal obscuration that surrounds the
central engine (e.g. Antonucci 1993). However, the structure
of the AGN environment must evolve with accretion rate and
luminosity—obviously the AGN disappears altogether once
the accretion rate drops to zero. The question is whether
the evolution induced by the decline of accretion rate pro-
duces discernible eﬀects before that ﬁnal point is reached;
that would imply that all AGN are in fact not intrinsically
the same.

An increasing number of AGN are reportedly miss-
ing broad emission lines, or the lines are extremely weak,
even though there is little or no obscuration to their central
source. First noticed in low luminosity AGN with low Ed-
dington ratios (see, among others, Tran 2001, 2003; Panessa
& Bassani 2002; Laor 2003), this phenomenon has now been
reported also in high Eddington-ratio AGN (Ho et al. 2012;
Miniutti et al. 2013). Since the ﬁrst reported objects of this

c(cid:13) 2016 The Authors

type show prominent narrow emission lines, they were re-
ferred to as “true type 2 AGN”. However, the unusual ap-
pearance is related more to the strength of the broad emis-
sion lines relative to the non-stellar continuum, and the
above name (which will be retained for the rest of the pa-
per) will be used to describe AGN with weak broad emission
lines, whatever the narrow line strength.

Conclusively establishing the absence of emission fea-
tures is always diﬃcult. Indeed, Stern & Laor (2012a,b) have
noted that the observed upper limits on broad Hα emission
in some previously claimed true type 2 AGN are insuﬃ-
cient to establish decisively the true nature of these sources.
This ambiguity does not mean that broad Hα must be there,
only that the data are not yet conclusive in demonstrating
its complete absence. Stern & Laor also noted that there
are sources where the absence of broad Hα emission is es-
tablished with such stringent upper limits, well below the
level expected from their X-ray luminosities, that they in-
deed appear to be true type 2 AGN. Another serious diﬃ-
culty is time variability. Some AGN, dubbed “changing look
quasars”, display temporal variations in broad line strengths
that cannot be attributed to transient obscuration and must
be related to a large sudden drop in accretion rate (see
LaMassa et al. 2015; MacLeod et al. 2015, and references
therein). While some of the suggested cases of true type

2 AGN undoubtedly reﬂect such temporary reductions in
broad Hα strength, multi-epoch observations preclude this
possibility in a number of others. On the basis of current
observational evidence, here we take the view that the true
type 2 phenomenon merits additional serious considerations
and seek a general theoretical framework to explain it.

Observations suggest that the broad-line region (BLR)
and the toroidal obscuration region (TOR, a.k.a. “the torus”)
may be the inner and outer zones, respectively, in a single,
continuous distribution of material whose composition un-
dergoes a change at the dust sublimation radius (see Elitzur
2008, and references therein). Such a structure arises natu-
rally in the disk-wind scenario, where the source of material
to the BLR and the TOR is mass outﬂow from the surface
of a disk that extends to distances that are an order of mag-
nitude larger than a “typical” BLR size (measured by rever-
beration mapping to be ∼103–104 gravitational radii). The
immediate prediction of this scenario (Elitzur & Shlosman
2006) is that at low accretion rates, the mass outﬂow rate de-
creases too and the wind radial column density eventually
drops below the minimum required to produce detectable
broad line emission in the dust-free zone and continuum ob-
scuration in the dusty zone. In this scenario, true type 2
AGN inevitably emerge at low accretion rates.

Elitzur & Ho (2009) presented a preliminary analysis
of mass conservation in the disk-wind scenario at low accre-
tion rates. They argued that the disappearance of the BLR
and TOR should occur at bolometric luminosities that obey
L ∝ M 2/3, where M is the black-hole mass, with a propor-
tionality coeﬃcient that varies among sources. While that
study focused on the low-luminosity end, here we present a
more complete analysis and examine in detail whether mass
conservation and the constraints it implies can also explain
the reported high-luminosity true type 2 AGN.

2 CONSTRAINTS ON BROAD LINE

EMISSION

Detectable broad line emission requires a minimal column
density, NH,min, to produce radial stratiﬁcation with pho-
toionization and recombination events occurring at a suﬃ-
cient rate. The fundamental quantity NH,min that sets the
threshold for detectable emission lines is determined by
physical processes and atomic constants, and is largely inde-
pendent of the AGN detailed structure. Following the results
of detailed photoionization calculations (e.g., Netzer 2013),
we adopt NH,min = 5×1021 cm−2. Denote

(cid:90)

NR =

n(R)dR

(1)

the column density along a radial ray close to the AGN
equatorial plane, where R is axial radius and n is the gas
density. Since the column is expected to decrease, or at least
not to increase, away from the equator toward the poles, no
other radial column is larger than NR. Therefore, to produce
a BLR the column NR must exceed NH,min, namely,

NR > NH,min

(2)

This is a fundamental constraint that must be obeyed by all
broad-line emitting AGN. It involves no assumptions about
the BLR detailed structure or dynamics.

2.1 Mass Conservation Constraint

While the column NH,min is controlled by basic physical pro-
cesses, NR is a speciﬁc property of each AGN and cannot be
calculated without some assumptions about the structure of
its BLR. Here we invoke the disk-wind scenario for the BLR
and derive NR from mass continuity for the outﬂow.

In the disk-wind scenario, the BLR corresponds to a
portion of the wind ejected from a ﬁnite annular segment
of the disk whose outer radius is set by dust sublimation.
Denote by ˙Mw the overall mass outﬂow rate from that seg-
ment of the disk. Accounting for emission from both faces of
a disk1, the mass conservation relation for a smooth-density
disk outﬂow is

˙Mw = 4πmp

nvzRdR,

(3)

(cid:90)

where mp is the proton mass, vz is the outﬂow velocity ver-
tical component at the disk surface and R and n as in eq.
1. We now introduce characteristic scales for the variables.
For R we use the dust sublimation radius Rd so that dimen-
sionless distance from the axis is

y =

R
Rd

(4)

and the origin of the BLR outﬂow corresponds to disk radii
y ≤ 1 (the TOR has y ≥ 1). We write the launch velocity
as vz(R) = vK(R)f (R), where vK(R) is the local Keplerian
velocity and f (< 1) a dimensionless proﬁle, and introduce

(cid:18) GM

(cid:19)1/2

.

vKd = vK(Rd) =

Rd

(5)

(6)

Then the outﬂow launch velocity becomes

vz(y) = vKd

f (y)
y1/2 .

(cid:90)

With NR from eq. 1, we extract from the density n its di-
mensionless radial proﬁle η through

n(y) =

NR
Rd

η(y),

so that

η(y)dy = 1.

(7)

The proﬁle η, normalized to unit integral, describes the func-
tional form of the density radial variation, e.g., a power law,
etc. (see §3.1 below). With these deﬁnitions, eq. 3 becomes

˙Mw = 4πmp RdvKdNR I,

where

I =

f ηy1/2dy.

(8)

(cid:90)

This is the mass conservation relation in terms of the radial
column NR through the disk outﬂow. Inserting NR from this
result into eq. 2 yields a constraint on the mass outﬂow rate
in broad-line emitting AGN. This constraint can be cast in
the convenient form

Nw > INH,min, where Nw =

is a characteristic column density formed out of the outﬂow
parameters (see Elitzur et al. 2014, which used the nota-
tion Ncrit for this quantity). This is the BLR constraint (eq.
2) in the disk-wind scenario, expressed in terms of global
properties of the system. All detailed information about the

speciﬁc structure of a given AGN, i.e., the functional forms
of its density and velocity radial distribution proﬁles, is con-
tained in a single factor, the dimensionless integral I.

A clumpy disk-outﬂow yields the exact same result. De-
note by Mc the mass of a single cloud, vc its vertical launch
velocity and nc the number density of clouds (number of
clouds per unit volume). Integrating over the disk area then
gives
H is the column den-
sity of a single cloud and Ac its cross-sectional area then
HAc. Since Nc ≡ ncAc is the number of clouds
Mc = mpN c
HNcvc RdR. Denote by

˙Mw = 4π(cid:82) McncvcRdR. If N c
(cid:82) N c

N0 ≡ (cid:82) Nc dR the (mean of the) total number of clouds

˙Mw = 4πmp

along a radial equatorial ray, then the total radial column
at the base of the wind (just above the disk surface) is NR=
N0N c
H. Introducing η = Nc(R)Rd/N0 yields back eq. 8 with
the same deﬁnition of f ; the only diﬀerence is that now η is
the normalized radial distribution of the number of clouds
per unit length instead of gas density. Given this, there is no
need to distinguish between the smooth and clumpy compo-
nents of the wind; NR is the total radial column density of
the outﬂow at its origin above the disk surface irrespective
of clumpiness.

The constraint in eq. 9 on broad-line emitting AGN is a
fundamental property of the disk-wind scenario. As a direct
consequence of mass conservation (eq. 3), it is in essence a
kinematic outcome of this scenario that does not involve any
assumptions about the wind dynamics, and is applicable for
both smooth and clumpy outﬂows.

2.2 Luminosity Constraint

Equation 9 provides a general constraint on disk outﬂows
in broad-line emitting AGN. Unfortunately, this relation-
ship has limited direct utility since it involves the BLR mass
outﬂow rate ˙Mw, which is not readily measurable. For com-
parison with observations we wish to relate ˙Mw to the bolo-
metric luminosity L. Black-hole mass accretion at the rate
˙M generates the luminosity L =  ˙M c2, where  is the ra-
diative conversion eﬃciency. Since we are interested in the
mass outﬂow rate ˙Mw, we introduce the ratio r = ˙M / ˙Mw
so that
L = r ˙Mwc2.

(10)

In this variation on the standard luminosity relation, the
˙M is replaced by the BLR
black-hole mass accretion rate
outﬂow rate ˙Mw, hence the radiative eﬃciency is replaced
by the product r. With this, eq. 8 for the relation between
˙Mw and NR becomes
L = 4πmpc2 rI (GM Rd)1/2NR.

(11)

This is the relation between the AGN luminosity and the
radial column density of the outﬂow at its origin above
the disk. It is not yet in suitable form since the luminos-
ity enters also indirectly on the right hand side because
of the L-dependence of dust sublimation. The dust subli-
mation radius obeys the relation Rd = b L1/2
45 pc, where
L45 = L/1045 erg s−1 and b is a normalization factor that
depends on the dust composition. Nenkova et al. (2008) con-
sidered a standard graphite-silicate dust mixture that yields
b = 0.43. Mor & Netzer (2012) suggest that, since only
pure graphite grains survive in the torus innermost part,
b (cid:39) 0.16 should be used instead. This is in good agreement

where M7 = M/107M(cid:12). This is the ﬁnal relation for radial

L > Lmin,

where

and Λ = 3.25×1045 ( rI)4/3 erg s−1.

(14)

This is the minimal luminosity for the existence of an ob-
servable BLR in the disk-wind scenario (cf Elitzur & Ho
2009). Objects whose luminosity falls below this limit do not
have a visible BLR and are classiﬁed as true type 2 AGN.
The relation between Lmin and the Eddington luminosity,
LEdd = 1.26×1045M7 erg s−1, is

(15)

Systems with masses M7 < 17.2 (rI)4 will have LEdd <
Lmin, thus they will necessarily be true type 2 AGN if they
have sub-Eddington luminosities.

3 NUMERICAL ESTIMATES

Equation 13 provides the fundamental constraint on broad
line emission in the disk-wind scenario, imposing a lower
limit on AGN luminosity that varies with the black-hole
mass. Because each of the three parameters I, r and  can
vary from source to source, Λ is expected to vary among
AGN (eq. 14) and systems with the same M could still be
subjected to diﬀerent lower limits on broad line emission.
Thus we need to ﬁnd the variation range of the luminosity
scale Λ.

erg s−1.

The lower end of this range can be estimated directly
from observations. From the Palomar AGN sample, Elitzur
& Ho (2009) ﬁnd that all broad line emission disappears at
luminosities lower than
LEH = 4.7×1039 M 2/3
Uniﬁcation then implies that all AGN below this boundary
are true type 2 (otherwise there would have been some type
1 counterparts). Since it is based on observations of low-
luminosity AGN, this limit is somewhat uncertain, owing to
the large uncertainties in determining bolometric luminosi-
ties in this regime. The LEH limit conforms to the luminos-
ity constraint of the disk-wind scenario (eq. 14), implying a
minimum for Λ of
Λmin (cid:39) 4.7×1039 erg s−1.
This minimum is reached when all three parameters I, r
and  have their smallest values. When each has its highest
value, the maximum of Λ is obtained. We now estimate one
by one the maxima of these three parameters.

3.1 The I-factor

To estimate the integral I (eq. 8) we need the ratio of
outﬂow launch velocity to local Keplerian velocity, f =
vz(R)/vK(R). The launch velocity is expected to be compa-
rable to the local turbulent velocity (the critical sonic-point
condition), thus the quantity needed is the ratio of turbulent
velocity to local Keplerian velocity in the disk. The most di-
rect estimate for this ratio comes from high-resolution H2O
maser observations. Such observations of the nuclear disk in
NGC 3079 show that the velocity dispersion is ∼ 14 km s−1
over a small region of strong emission where the Keplerian
velocity is 110 km s−1 (Kondratko et al. 2005), suggesting
that in the maser region f is probably of order ∼ 0.1. Given
the lack of information about the turbulent velocity close
to the inner disk producing the BLR wind, we assume that
the value of f in this region is similar to that derived from
the observations further out in the maser region; that is, we
make the assumption that at every point in the disk, the
turbulent velocity is a ﬁxed fraction, f ∼ 10%, of the local
Keplerian velocity. Then
I (cid:39) 0.1J,

where J =

(cid:90)

ηy1/2dy

(18)

and η is the proﬁle of the radial variation of density, properly
normalized (eq. 7).

Without a detailed model for the BLR dynamics, the
functional form of η remains unknown. However, we can still
place reasonable limits on the integral J from various power-
laws η ∝ y−p, for which the integration is immediate. Figure
1 shows the variation of J with relative radial thickness Y
(ratio of outer-to-inner radius) for representative values of
p. The full radial extent of the BLR is expected to be in the
range Rout/Rin ∼ 50− 100, and ﬁgure 1 shows that J hardly
varies with Y in this range. The bulk of the variation comes
from the dependence on p; J varies from ∼ 0.2 for p = 2 to
∼ 0.7 for p = 0. These values bracket the likely range of J
for actual η proﬁles. Therefore
Imax (cid:39) 0.07,

(19)

a maximum reached for ﬂatter radial density distributions.
The ﬁgure also shows that the assumption of constant f
should not have a marked impact on the outcome—a small
radial variation of f (R) could simply be absorbed into the
power law.

3.2 The radiative eﬃciency 

Beginning with the early 1970’s, the theory of disk accretion
has been investigated in numerous studies. In the standard
theory, the mass accretion rate through the disk is constant.
Outﬂows invalidate this assumption, and recent studies by
Slone & Netzer (2012) and Laor & Davis (2014) were the
ﬁrst to investigate their eﬀect on the observed disk spectra.
We assume that most of the mass outﬂow takes place at dis-
tances that are typical of the BLR, shown by reverberation
mapping to be ∼103–104 GM/c2, well outside the main con-
tinuum producing region, which in standard thin accretion
models is of order 50–100 GM/c2. This allows us to use the
standard disk theory to estimate the bolometric luminosity.
For geometrically-thin optically-thick disks the radia-
tive eﬃciency ranges from 0.038 for a retrograde disk, to

normalization of η (eq. 7).

0.057 for stationary black hole (BH) to 0.32 for maximally
rotating BH with spin parameter of 0.998 (Shakura & Sun-
yaev 1973). When the eﬀects of radiation capture by the
BH are accounted for,  at maximal spinning is reduced
to 0.3 (Thorne 1974). Slim accretion disks were suggested
to have smaller eﬃciency (Wang et al. 2014 and references
therein), but this is not yet conﬁrmed by numerical simula-
tions (e.g. S¸adowski & Narayan 2015). Recent observational
studies provide support for the radiatively eﬃcient solutions
for accretion through thin disks. From detailed analysis of
spectral properties, Davis & Laor (2011) estimated the val-
ues of  for all PG quasars. The majority of the sources are
consistent with the theoretical solutions for radiatively ef-
ﬁcient accretion through thin disks, with  falling between
∼6–30%. A more detailed analysis of 39 luminous AGN at
z (cid:39) 1.55, by Capellupo et al. (2015, 2016), illustrated the
very good agreement between the predicted thin disk SED
and the observations of all these objects. Given this, we can
reasonably take for  the upper limit
max (cid:39) 0.3,

(20)

the radiative eﬃciency of a maximally spinning accreting
black hole.

3.3 The r-ratio
This is the ratio r = ˙M / ˙Mw of mass accretion into the black
hole to mass outﬂow from the BLR (§2.2). Because of the
disk outﬂow, not all the mass that enters the BLR ﬁnds its
way to the black hole. Denote by ˙M outer the rate at which
mass enters the BLR through its outer disk boundary (the
sublimation radius Rd) and by γ = ˙Mw/ ˙M outer the fraction
of that accreted material lost to the wind. Then the rate of
radial inﬂow from the BLR inner boundary toward the black
˙M outer(1 − γ). As just noted (§3.2), the radial mass
hole is
inﬂow rate through the disk can be taken as constant inside

rate is

˙M = ˙M outer(1 − γ) and

1 − γ

γ

r =

.

(21)

The largest r corresponds to the smallest γ, obtained when
the fractional mass carried away by the wind is at minimum.
However, the limit γ → 0 implies shutting oﬀ the outﬂow al-
together, as it carries a smaller and smaller fraction of the
accreted mass; that in itself would turn oﬀ broad line emis-
sion in the context of the disk-wind scenario assumed here.
For any relevance in this context and to have an impact
on observable AGN properties, the disk wind must carry
some minimal fraction of the accreted mass. Here we as-
sume, somewhat arbitrarily, that for the self-consistency of
this scenario this fraction should be at least ∼10%. This re-
quirement implies that γ must be at least ∼0.1 in meaningful
disk-wind models of the BLR, leading to
rmax (cid:39) 9.

(22)

3.4 The range of Λ

The minimal value of Λ, the proportionality coeﬃcient in the
luminosity constraint on broad line emission (eq. 14), was
determined directly from observations in eq. 17. Determining
the maximum requires a theoretical estimate. Combining our
estimates for maximal I (eq. 19),  (eq. 20) and r (eq. 22)
yields
Λmax (cid:39) 3.5×1044 erg s−1

(23)

A large Λ means that observable broad line emission requires
a large bolometric luminosity, increasing the range of lumi-
nosities that can lead to true type 2 operation. An AGN
is more likely to be a true type 2 if it has I, r and  at
the upper end of their ranges. A larger I implies a ﬂatter
density proﬁle (ﬁg. 1): a larger fraction of the outﬂow mass
resides at larger radii, therefore the same minimal column is
accompanied by a larger ˙Mw, i.e., L. Larger r imply that the
outﬂow carries away a smaller fraction of the mass (eq. 21),
˙Mw, i.e., L, in order to reach the min-
requiring a larger
imal BLR column density. And a larger  means that the
mass accretion rate corresponding to the minimal column
for a BLR will produce a higher luminosity. At the upper
end of Λ, an AGN with a maximally rotating BH ( = 0.3)
whose mass is 1010 M(cid:12) will be true type 2 as long as it has
L < 3.5×1046 erg s−1, a rather high luminosity threshold.

While Λmin was determined from the data, it is instruc-
tive to examine its theoretical implications for the minimal
values of the parameters I, r and . From eq. 18 and ﬁg.
1, the smallest I is ∼ 0.02, implying that the minimal val-
ues of the two other parameters obey rminmin (cid:39) 2×10−3.
The smallest r is obtained from the largest γ, the fraction of
the mass carried away by the BLR outﬂow (§3.3). Since the
outﬂow mass applies a back torque on the underlying disk,
the amount of material the wind can extract from the disk
is limited. In the case of magnetically driven disk winds,
an estimate of this upper limit based on the Blandford &
Payne (1982) self-similar solution yields γ <∼ 0.3 (Emmering
et al. 1992; Pelletier & Pudritz 1992). This implies rmin ∼ 2
(eq. 21) and min ∼ 10−3. Mass extraction by the outﬂow
might reach a higher maximum as a result of other eﬀects,

e.g., radiation pressure. Increasing the maximal γ to 50%,
so that fully a half of the mass entering the disk at the
BLR outer boundary is blown away and only the remain-
ing half is eventually accreted by the BH, yields rmin = 1
and min ∼ 2×10−3. These estimates for min are compatible
˙M
with theoretical expectations for low accretion rates: As
decreases below the values assumed in classical accretion-
disk solutions (§3.2), thermalization times become longer,
the solution switches to the advection dominated accretion
ﬂow (ADAF) mode and the radiative eﬃciency decreases to
∼ 10−3 (for recent reviews, see Narayan 2002; Yuan 2007).

3.5 High-luminosity true type 2 AGN
Figure 2 summarizes our results, showing in the L − M
plane the luminosity boundaries for observable broad emis-
sion lines for the two extremes of Λ (eqs. 17, 23). Hatch-
ing indicates the domain of super-Eddington luminosities.
Because of the diﬀerent M -dependences of Lmin and LEdd,
their contours intersect in the L− M plane at a mass whose
value can be determined from eq. 15. The lower red bound-
ary, marked “min Λ”, corresponds to the minimal values of
I, r and . As the parameters increase, the boundary moves
upwards and when all three reach their maximal values, Λ is
the largest and the boundary becomes the upper red curve,
marked “max Λ”. If broad line emission is properly described
by the disk-wind scenario then all AGN below the low bound-
ary are true type 2 and all AGN above the upper boundary
are broad line emitters. We reemphasize that this predic-
tion is an immediate consequence of mass conservation and
applies to all disk outﬂows whether smooth or clumpy and
whatever the dynamics model at their foundation.

The lower red boundary corresponds to the luminosity
LEH (eq. 16). As noted above, this is currently the lowest lu-
minosity observed for any broad-line emitting AGN (Elitzur
& Ho 2009). But the disappearance of all broad line emission
below LEH does not imply that it must exist in every object

(cid:96) = L/LEdd; (5) the largest luminosity and (6) smallest radiative eﬃciency that would still be consistent with a true type 2 classiﬁcation

above this limit: Sources above the lower red boundary can
be true type 2, below the upper red boundary they can be
broad-line emitters, hence in between these boundaries they
can be either. An AGN in this intermediate region will dis-
play broad line emission only if its own parameters are such
that L/M 2/3
7 > Λ(I, r, ), otherwise it will be a true type 2.
In particular, just below the upper red boundary an AGN
could still be a true type 2 if it had a standard thin disk
around a maximally spinning black hole ( = 0.3) and if its
r and I were at the upper end of their ranges. We will refer
7 < Λ(I, r, ) in the L − M domain
to objects with L/M 2/3
between the two red boundaries as high-luminosity true type
2 AGN. Since the BLR can disappear anywhere below the
upper red boundary, type 2 AGN can exist at any Edding-
ton ratio and at luminosities as high as a few 1046 erg s−1.
Sources that have both high masses and high Eddington ra-
tios will not become true type 2—the Eddington ratio of
a 1010 M(cid:12) AGN on the upper red boundary is only 2.8%.
Searches for true type 2 AGN will have higher success rates
at lower Eddington ratios because every AGN can be a true
type 2 at Eddington ratio below ∼ 1%. Similarly, at masses
lower than 2.2×105 M(cid:12) every sub-Eddington AGN can be
a true type 2.

4 COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS

To determine whether broad lines are missing from the ob-
served spectrum of an AGN we need to establish the line
intensity expected in the source. From the large body of
observations, empirical relations have been derived for the
dependences of line equivalent widths (EWs) on source lu-
minosity, host galaxy luminosity, the aperture used for the
spectroscopic observations, and the signal-to-noise of the ob-
servations. Perhaps the most suitable line in the optical part
of the spectrum is Hα, the strongest broad emission line ob-
served from the ground in low redshift AGN. Detailed stud-

ies of broad emission lines in low redshift SDSS AGN of
low to intermediate luminosity show a large range of 300–
600˚A for EW(bHα), the broad Hα equivalent width rela-
tive to the intrinsic AGN continuum (Greene & Ho 2005;
Stern & Laor 2012a, and references therein). The distribu-
tion is very broad and sources with EW(bHα) smaller than
200˚A are quite common. Very high luminosity type 1 AGN
tend to show somewhat smaller EW(bHα) (e.g. Capellupo
et al. 2015), but the diﬀerence may not be statistically sig-
niﬁcant. Most, perhaps all of these sources are expected to
be powered by standard, high eﬃciency accretion disks (Net-
zer & Trakhtenbrot 2014). The observational uncertainties
on EW(bHα) can be large, especially among low luminosity
AGN where the host galaxy contribution inside the chosen
aperture (e.g. the 3(cid:48)(cid:48) SDSS ﬁber) can exceed the AGN con-
tribution, making the subtraction of stellar light quite un-
certain. The uncertainties for type 1 LINERs, which may be
powered by ADAF, are so large that it is not at all clear
whether the typical EW(bHα) distribution of such sources
is similar to that observed in the other type 1 AGN. The
mean observed value adopted here is EW(bHα) = 500˚A.

According to Stern & Laor (2012a), there is a strong
linear correlation between the broad Hα luminosity, LbHα,
and the AGN bolometric luminosity L, as derived from X-
ray observations, and the above mean EW corresponds to
L (cid:39) 130LbHα. Practical lower limits for Hα detection in type
1 AGN can be set at 10% of the expected values, namely,
EW(bHα) (cid:39) 50˚A or LbHα (cid:39) L/1300. Below these limits
we classify the source as a true type 2 AGN. Sources with
intermediate EW(bHα), of order 50–100˚A, are considered
to be intermediate-type AGN. We also note that EW(Hβ)
(cid:39) 0.2 EW(Hα) typically, thus our critical EW(bHα) corre-
sponds to EW(bHβ) (cid:39) 10˚A; this would be a very weak broad
line, hard to detect among the numerous broad and narrow
lines in the wavelength range 4800–4900˚A centered on Hβ.
It is not our intention to carry out a systematic search
of the literature for true type 2 AGN that obey the strict

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2016)

upper limit set here on the broad Hα line. Instead we fo-
cus on a small group where a very detailed, high quality
study has already been carried out to establish the nature
of each source as a true type 2 AGN. Table 1 summarizes
the properties of such published cases, listing them in order
of increasing L. The list is by no means complete but rather
based on carefully checked observations known to us. The
listed luminosities and BH masses are from the original pa-
pers. In the absence of broad lines, the mass estimates are
generally based on correlations with bulge properties, which
carry a typical error of 0.5 dex (e.g. L¨asker et al. 2014). The
uncertainty in L depends on the X-ray observations and the
conversion between L(2–10 keV) and L. The assumption for
all sources listed here is that their X-ray luminosity scales
with L the same as in “typical” type 1 AGN, an assumption
that is not directly testable for true type 2s. In this case,
the uncertainty on L is about 0.2–0.3 dex. Of the 15 listed
sources, the two with the smallest BH masses stand out with
their very high Eddington ratios.

erg s−1.

The quantities Lmin> and m, tabulated in columns 5
and 6, respectively, were derived for each object from the
disk-wind scenario described above. According this scenario,
an AGN transitions into the true type 2 class when its lu-
minosity drops below ΛM 2/3
(eq. 14). Denote by Lmin> the
transition luminosity corresponding to the maximal value of
Λ (eq. 23)
Lmin> = 3.5×1044 M 2/3
Listed in column 5, Lmin> would be the location on the up-
per red boundary in Figure 2 of an AGN with the same BH
mass. Given the uncertainty on the BH mass, the uncer-
tainty on Lmin> is about 0.3 dex. For a given AGN, absence
of broad-line emission is compatible with the mass conserva-
tion bound if its luminosity L is lower than its Lmin>. Since
every listed source has L < Lmin>, they all comply with the
disk-wind constraint on true type 2 AGN. In most cases, the
bound is obeyed by a suﬃciently comfortable margin that
Lmin need not be as large as Lmin>, implying that Λ need
not be at its maximum, i.e., the parameters I, r and  can
be smaller than their maximal values, in particular  could
be less than 0.3 (eq. 20).

(24)

The smallest radiative eﬃciency, m, that a source could
have and still comply with the condition for BLR disappear-
ance is the one that produces Lmin = L with r and I at their
respective maxima. From eq. 14, Lmin ∝ 4/3 when r and I
are held ﬁxed, therefore

the quantity entered in column 6 of Table 1. This is an esti-
mate of the minimal ; the actual radiative eﬃciency of the
source can be anywhere between m and 0.3. The uncertainty
on m depends on the uncertainties on L and M , and is of
order 0.4 dex. The derived range of  is reasonably tight for
the two objects with the highest Eddington ratios, consistent
with thin accretion disks with a spin parameter larger than
0.7, i.e. close to maximum spinning. For all other sources
the range is too wide for a meaningful constraint. Still, it is
interesting that they all have m below the thin disk mini-
mum of 0.038, consistent with the ADAF disks expected at
their low Eddington ratios, which are below ∼1% .

in the L − M plane. All of them fall below the upper red
boundary, in agreement with a true type 2 classiﬁcation for
values of Λ intermediate between its two extremes (eqs. 17,
23). The absence of broad line emission in all of these unob-
scured sources agrees with the luminosity constraint arising
from mass conservation in the disk-wind scenario.

5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Outﬂows are widely recognized as an important component
of the AGN environment, and magnetically driven winds are
plausible candidates for the origin of high-velocity outﬂows
from the inner radii of AGN accretion disks (Peterson 2006;
Slone & Netzer 2012, and references therein). Broad line dis-
appearance at some low AGN luminosity is inherent to the
BLR outﬂow scenario since broad line emission requires a
minimal column density, implying a minimal outﬂow rate
and thus a minimal accretion rate. This result is indepen-
dent of the detailed wind dynamics, which is still poorly
understood. Although a general formulation of the disk out-
ﬂow from ﬁrst principles does not yet exist, the luminosity
bound formulated here is applicable whatever the details
of such future theory might be. Dynamics considerations
may only add additional constraints. For example, Nicas-
tro (2000) considered the interplay between radiation- and
gas-pressure in disk outﬂows and found a diﬀerent bound
on the luminosity of broad-line emitting AGN. This model-
speciﬁc bound, and others like it, can only supplement the
mass-conservation bound derived here, which is always ap-
plicable.

The fundamental constraint on broad line emission con-
veniently splits the problem into its separate elements. The
minimal column density NH,min required for broad line emis-
sion is determined purely by atomic processes, independent
of any considerations of the BLR detailed structure. The
black-hole and outﬂow parameters combine to form another
characteristic column, Nw. Mass conservation imposes the
limit in eq. 9 that involves these two fundamentally diﬀer-
ent column densities and the additional parameter I, the
only quantity with dependence on the wind detailed struc-
ture (eq. 8). Because NH,min is diﬀerent for diﬀerent emission
lines, various broad lines could disappear at somewhat dif-
ferent luminosities and produce line ratios that diﬀer from
standard broad line spectra. For example, the main emis-
sion region for the Balmer lines is about three times further
away than the formation region of C iv1549. The latter also
require smaller critical column. Thus a reduction in accre-
tion rate could produce an abnormally large (relative to type
1 AGN) C iv1549/Hα line ratio during the transition stage
from type 1 to true type 2.

The resulting limit on luminosity of broad-line emit-
ters (eq. 13) is independent of the wind dynamics. The large
spread in luminosities of the transition to true type 2 (eqs.
17, 23) primarily reﬂects the large range predicted for the
radiative eﬃciency , covering the entire range of fast spin-
ning BHs surrounded by thin accretion disks to low eﬃciency
ADAFs. When operating at the upper end of the range of Λ,
an AGN with M = 1010M(cid:12) will become a true type 2 when
its luminosity drops below 3.5×1046 erg s−1, well inside QSO
range. Objects with high eﬃciency are those where the same
˙Mw and hence are more likely to
L is obtained with lower

lose their broad line emission, especially if the outﬂow also
has a shallow radial density proﬁle. This scenario predicts
that true type 2 AGN should show an increased abundance
of BH with high spin parameter.

7

An AGN loses its broad line emission when L/Lmin de-
creases to < 1, which can happen at any Eddington ratio
(see eq. 15 and ﬁg. 2). The present analysis shows that the
AGN sub-pc structure could be controlled by an entirely dif-
ferent luminosity scale, Lmin = ΛM 2/3
(eq. 14). The scale
factor Λ not only varies among AGN but for a given source
it can also vary as it evolves. Does every AGN go through a
true type 2 phase? We note that L ∝  ˙M while Lmin ∝ 4/3
when the other properties remain constant. The AGN will

tion rate, therefore the issue revolves around the behavior of
this ratio. The fact that true type 2 AGN do exist indicates
that this ratio does indeed decrease with ˙M , at least in some
sources. For standard accretion disks,  cannot change on a
short (several thousand years) time scale, since this is basi-
cally the BH spin, and the transition to true type 2 follows
directly from the drop of

˙M .

5.1 Toroidal Obscuration Region

Although our focus here is BLR properties, the disk-wind
scenario has similar implications also for the TOR. How-
ever, deriving a quantitative estimate for the equivalent
of Lmin (eq. 14) for TOR disappearance is more diﬃcult
because it brings in the outﬂow properties of the TOR,
whose relation to those of the BLR and the AGN bolo-
metric luminosity L is unknown. A direct comparison of
the radial columns through the TOR and BLR can be ob-
tained with the aid of eq. 8, which shows that NR ∝ ˙Mw/I
for the column through each of these two outﬂow regions,
with the same proportionality coeﬃcient for both. There-

superscripts denoting the respective quantities in each of
the two regions. From the deﬁnition of I in eq. 18 it is
straightforward to show that I BLR/I TOR < 1, whatever the
functional form of the radial density proﬁle η.2 But the ratio
˙M TOR
is entirely unknown, and cannot be estimated
without a full theoretical model for the disk outﬂow around
AGN. Such a model would have to include all relevant forces,
in particular the radiation pressure which can be widely dif-
ferent in the two regions.

Since a calculation of Lmin is not yet feasible for the
TOR, we cannot determine in any given source whether the
TOR should disappear before the BLR or the other way
round. In principle, there could exist both true type 2 AGN
and broad line emitters with and without dust obscuration.
However, the basic fact that the TOR must disappear be-
low some accretion rate is inherent to the disk wind sce-

eq. 18 obeys(cid:82) ηy1/2dy = ¯y1/2 where ¯y is the value of y at some

2 Because of the normalization of η (eq. 7), the integration in
point inside the integration range. And because y ≥ 1 for the
TOR while y ≤ 1 for the BLR, J is > 1 for the former and < 1
for the latter. This also shows that J → 1 for either region when
Y → 1 (cf ﬁg. 1).

nario: Dust obscuration requires a minimal column density
therefore the TOR, too, must disappear at suﬃciently low
accretion rates and with it the AGN mid-infrared (MIR)
emission. That is, dust obscuration of both the central con-
tinuum and the broad lines should disappear at some low
luminosity and the ratio LMIR/L should decrease when the
luminosity drops below a certain, yet undetermined value.

The above predictions are partly supported by the ob-
servations. Chiaberge et al. (1999) ﬁnd that torus obscura-

tion disappears in low-luminosity ( <∼ 1042 erg s−1) FR I ra-

dio galaxies, and Maoz et al. (2005) ﬁnd similar results for
LINERs. MIR observations are required to look for torus
dust emission in such systems. Some evidence supporting
the decline of MIR emission in LINERs comes from recent
works by Rosario et al. (2013) and Gonz´alez-Mart´ın et al.
(2015). Disappearance of the torus IR emission has been re-
ported also in a number of individual low-luminosity sources
(Whysong & Antonucci 2004; Perlman et al. 2007; M¨uller-
S´anchez et al. 2013).

The predicted torus disappearance at low L does not
imply that the disk wind is abruptly extinguished, only that
its outﬂow rate is lower than in high-luminosity AGN. When
the mass outﬂow rate drops below these “standard torus” val-
ues, the outﬂow still provides toroidal obscuration as long as
its column exceeds ∼ 1021 cm−2. Indeed, Maoz et al. (2005)
found that some LINERs do have obscuration, but much
smaller than “standard”. Line transmission through a low-
obscuration torus might also explain the low polarizations
of broad Hα lines observed by Barth et al. (1999) in some
low luminosity systems.

5.2 Potential Alternative Explanations

Could there be other explanations for broad line disappear-
ance? Since broad lines arise from reprocessing of the cen-
tral continuum, detectable broad emission lines require suf-
ﬁciently strong ionizing continuum and eﬃcient conversion
of this continuum to line radiation. The latter involves the
BLR column density, i.e., the matter distribution in the ra-
dial direction, and its covering factor, i.e., the angular dis-
tribution. Having concentrated on the column density, we
now examine the potential role of the two other factors.

5.2.1 Disk SED

We can estimate the inﬂuence of diﬀerent SEDs on observed
line EWs using previous studies of large AGN samples. In
particular, in sources powered by standard accretion disks,
we can examine the possible connection between line EW
and the intensity of the “big blue bump” (BBB), the part
of the SED around 1000–3000˚A which is directly observed
in many sources and must be related to the shape of the
ionizing continuum at wavelengths below 912˚A.

Thin accretion disk models show that, given BH mass
and spin, a smaller accretion rate is more noticeable in the
short wavelength part of the spectrum and hence aﬀects the
Lyman continuum radiation more than the continuum at
4861˚A or 6563˚A, the respective wavelengths of the Hβ and
Hα lines. Such variations also aﬀect the intensity of the BBB
relative to the longer wavelength continuum. The shape of
the SED is also associated with BH mass. Accretion disks

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2016)

around more massive BHs but similar L/LEdd and BH spin
are predicted to have weaker BBB and smaller ratios of Ly-
man continuum to optical luminosity, which would decrease
the Balmer line EWs. All predictions regarding disk SEDs
are veriﬁed by a recent detailed comparison of accretion disk
models with the data of 39 AGN (Capellupo et al. 2015,
2016). Here, and in several earlier, somewhat less detailed
studies (see Capellupo et al. 2015 for references), the steeper
SED and weaker BBB as functions of accretion rate, BH
mass and spin are all demonstrated quite clearly. Given this,
one may argue that true type 2 AGN are weak line emitters
because of their softer SED, the result of the lower accretion
rate. A deﬁnitive study of this issue requires comparisons of
line EWs in larger samples that cover sources with diﬀerent
luminosity, accretion rate (or L/LEdd) and BH mass, and
represent the entire AGN population (which the Capellupo
et al sample did not).

The observational situation regarding broad line EWs
has been studied in great detail under the title “The Bald-
win eﬀect” (Baldwin 1977), the well known correlation of
the EWs of several broad emission lines with continuum lu-
minosity. While clearly observed in several strong UV lines,
such as C iv1549 (Risaliti et al. 2011, and references therein),
the hydrogen Balmer lines produce conﬂicting results. For
example, Greene & Ho (2005) provide observational corre-
lations between L(Hα), L(Hβ) and L5100 (the 5100˚A lumi-
nosity) for sources with L5100 = 1042.5–1045 erg s−1. For the
Hβ line this study ﬁnds a correlation that can be trans-
lated to EW(Hβ) ∝ L1.13
5100, the opposite of what is ob-
served for C iv1549, i.e. an inverse Baldwin eﬀect. However,
the systematic study by Stern & Laor (2012a), including
sources with L5100 = 1041.8–1045.2 erg s−1, shows a ratio of
LbHα/L5100 that does not vary with the source luminosity.
This can be interpreted as EW(bHα) which is independent
of luminosity, i.e., no Baldwin eﬀect. As yet another exam-
ple we use the sample of 135 sources discussed by Netzer
et al. (2004). In this case L5100 ranges from 1043.4–1047.5
erg s−1 and EW(Hβ) varies from about 100–120˚A at the
lowest luminosities to 60–70˚A for the most luminous AGN
in the universe, i.e., a very weak Baldwin eﬀect. This sample
contains the most massive BHs, yet the range in EW(Hβ),
and L/LEdd, is not very diﬀerent from that in sources where
the BH mass, and AGN luminosity, are 3 orders of magni-
tude lower. Finally, studies of very large samples, such as
SDSS, also show EW(Hβ) ∼ 60-100˚A for L5100 = 1043.5–
1045.5 erg s−1, and no correlation between the two (see ﬁg
7.16 in Netzer 2013).

It is not our intention to discuss the origin of the Bald-
win relationship—an area of much confusion, dominated by
various selection eﬀects and biases with no clear physical
explanation. We simply point out that the observed Balmer
line EWs do not change much across a very large range of
physical conditions, much larger than that spanned by the
15 sources in Table 1. This is an indication that the changing
ionizing continuum of standard thin accretion disks cannot
by itself be the origin of the changing line EWs in type 1
AGN. The conclusion is that, much like type 1 AGN, true
type 2 AGN can show weak or strong BBB, depending on
their other properties. Needless to say, the predictions of
the standard accretion disk scenario regarding the ionizing
ﬂux cannot be extrapolated in a simple way to the lower

eﬃciency ADAF systems, where the theory is far less un-
derstood.
To explain objects that meet the criterion we set for
true type 2 AGN (§4) purely by SED eﬀects, the number of
ionizing photons would have to be reduced by a full factor of
10. However, since all of the sources listed in Table 1 show
strong, high-ionization narrow lines, their broad line deﬁcits
could be attributed purely to a change in the SED only
if that change had occurred within the past ∼1000 years,
the typical recombination time for the narrow lines region
(NLR). A sharp drop in luminosity a few decades ago is a
possibility since the NLR cannot disappear on such a short
time scale. However, L/LEdd for several of the sources in
question places them in the domain of standard accretion
disks, where a factor 10 reduction in the accretion rate would
not produce a similar decrease in EW(bHα). For example,
our calculations of disk SEDs for 1ES1927+6054 (see Ta-
ble 1) using the Slone & Netzer (2012) code show that an
increase in accretion rate by a factor of 10 relative to the
one listed in the table, combined with an assumed spin pa-
rameter of 0.7 and no change in covering factor, results in an
increase by a factor of 2.5 in EW(bHα). This is far below the
diﬀerence required to explain the big change in EW(bHα)
between a “typical” type 1 source and a true type 2. A sev-
eral year monitoring of the sources in Table 1 could provide
a more decisive answer to this question. Although current
data do not provide deﬁnitive evidence, it seems unlikely
that in each of the Table 1 sources the number of ionizing
photons is less than 10% of that in type 1 AGN with similar
optical continuum luminosity.

5.2.2 Covering Factors

Whatever the AGN properties, the production of detectable
broad lines requires part of its sky to be covered by material
that captures a suﬃcient fraction of the ionizing continuum.
The Stern & Laor (2012a,b) study of a large SDSS-selected
sample of type 1 AGN shows that at low luminosity, most of
them actually appear as intermediate types (type 1.x), with
a reduced ratio of broad-to-narrow line strength. For the
same data, Elitzur et al. (2014) show that the ratio of broad
line to bolometric luminosity decreases along the spectral
sequence type 1.0 → 1.x → true type 2, indicating a gradual
decline in broad-line covering factor as the accretion rate
is decreasing. Thus the broad-line disappearance could be
attributed to a diminishing covering factor without the need
to invoke a changing column density.

Elitzur et al. proposed that this spectral evolution arises
naturally if the wind is seeded with clouds that dominate its
broad line emission. Remarkably, the same quantity Nw (eq.
9) sets the scale not only for the mass outﬂow rate but also
for the dynamics of cloud motions: the clouds are accelerated
against the gravitational pull of the central black hole by the
ram pressure of the wind in which they are embedded, and
the ratio of these opposing forces on a cloud with column
density N c
H/Nw. While the details of
this speciﬁc model are beyond the scope of the present pa-
per, the direct connection with the wind column density is
most relevant to our basic proposal. This model involves the
additional assumption of cloud-dominated broad-line emis-
sion and thus is not nearly as universal as the current result.

5.2.3 Conclusions

Weakening and disappearing broad emission lines in type 1
AGN can result from a changing disk SED, a drop in BLR
covering factor or a decrease in ionized column. All three can
be related to a declining accretion rate through the disk and
it is diﬃcult to disentangle their eﬀects. Moreover, reﬂect-
ing the matter angular and radial distributions, respectively,
the covering factor and column density may be inherently
related to each other. But whatever the other eﬀects, the re-
lation L > Lmin (eq. 13) stands out in its universality as an
absolute lower limit for detectable broad line emission from
disk outﬂows. As noted before, broad line disappearance be-
low this limit arises directly from mass conservation with-
out any additional assumptions about the wind clumpiness,
structure or dynamics, and thus is a fundamental property
of the disk-wind scenario. Within this scenario, broad-line
disappearance triggered by a decrease of either ionizing con-
tinuum or covering factor will only produce true type 2 AGN
with luminosity higher than Lmin.
