Abstract. We consider the N -body problem of celestial mechanics in spaces
of nonzero constant curvature. Using the concept of locked inertia tensor, we
compute the moment of inertia for systems moving on spheres and hyperbolic
spheres and show that we can recover the classical deﬁnition in the Euclidean
case. After proving some criteria for the existence of relative equilibria, we ﬁnd
a natural way to deﬁne the concept of central conﬁguration in curved spaces
using the moment of inertia, and show that our deﬁnition is formally similar to
the one that governs the classical problem. The existence criteria we develop for
central conﬁgurations help us provide several examples and prove that, for any
given point masses on spheres and hyperbolic spheres, central conﬁgurations
always exist. We end our paper with results concerning the number of central
conﬁgurations that lie on the same geodesic, thus extending the celebrated
theorem of Moulton to hyperbolic spheres and pointing out that it has no
straightforward generalization to spheres, where the count gets complicated
even in the case N = 2.

1. Introduction

The notion of central conﬁguration for the N-body problem of celestial me-
chanics was introduced by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1789 in connection with the
discovery of Eulerian and Lagrangian orbits, [37], [27], [36]. But a ﬁrst system-
atic study of this concept appeared only in 1900, when Otto Dziobek published a
fundamental paper on central conﬁgurations, [25]. Research in this direction has
continued ever since, showing over the past decades that central conﬁgurations
are essential for understanding the equations of motion that describe the N-body
problem. Although breakthroughs are rare in this diﬃcult area of mathematics,
some recent progress has been made on the Wintner-Smale conjecture, which we
will discuss later in detail.

1.1. Motivation. In 1772 Joseph Louis Lagrange found the equilateral solutions
of the 3-body problem and rediscovered the collinear orbits, whose existence Leon-
hard Euler had proved a decade earlier. These particular motions, called homo-
graphic because their conﬁgurations stay similar to themselves for all time, can
be decomposed into homothetic solutions and relative equilibria. The former are
dilations and/or contractions of the particle system without rotation, whereas
the latter are rotations without dilations or contractions, such that the mutual
distances remain constant during the motion. Starting from the homothetic La-
grangian orbits, Laplace noticed that it may be simpler to seek the geometrical
conﬁgurations that remain similar to themselves, which we now call central con-
ﬁgurations, instead of looking for the homographic solutions to the diﬀerential
equations, [65]. From the mathematical point of view, central conﬁgurations do
not involve the time variable and are described by the system

∇U(q) = λ∇I(q),

4

where q gives the positions of the bodies, U is the force function (the negative of
the potential), I is the moment of inertia as deﬁned in (2) below, λ is a constant,
and ∇ denotes the gradient. Every central conﬁguration automatically provides
classes of relative equilibrium, homothetic, and homographic orbits. Therefore the
dynamical question of ﬁnding certain solutions of an ordinary diﬀerential equation
is reduced to an algebraic system, a methodology often used in this ﬁeld.

1.2. Importance. Research done since 1900 has shown that the concept of cen-
tral conﬁguration opens a path towards understanding the N-body problem. Not
only that it provides a method for ﬁnding periodic solutions, which Henri Poincar´e
deemed as a key towards untangling systems of diﬀerential equations, but it ap-
pears in various other circumstances. For instance, it was shown that when three
or more bodies tend to a simultaneous collision, or when they scatter to inﬁnity,
they do so tending asymptotically to a central conﬁguration, [54], [55].

However, ﬁnding central conﬁgurations is far from easy. Basic questions related
to them are often diﬃcult to answer. One such question is known as the Wintner-
Smale conjecture, which became notorious after Stephen Smale placed it sixth on
his list of open problems for the 21st century, [60]. The problem asks whether,
for given N positive masses, the number of planar central conﬁgurations is ﬁnite
or not. So far, the conjecture is solved only for N = 3, 4, and 5, see [47] and [2].
In all these cases the answer is that the set of central conﬁgurations is ﬁnite. But
it is possible that for more than ﬁve bodies this set is inﬁnite. If so, it may be
countable or contain a continuum, as it actually happens when some masses are
negative or charges are embedded in the system, [3], [53].

1.3. Brief history. We consider here the motion of N point masses in spaces
of constant Gaussian curvature κ 6= 0, namely spheres for κ > 0 and hyperbolic
spheres for κ < 0. This problem stems from the work of J´anos Bolyai and Nikolai
Lobachevsky, done in the 1830s, who independently had the idea of generalizing
celestial mechanics to hyperbolic space, being among the ﬁrst to understand that
the laws of physics are related to the geometry of the universe, [6], [42]. The
analytic form of the potential, given by the cotangent of the distance, was in-
troduced in 1870 by Ernest Schering in hyperbolic space, [56], [57], and in 1873
by Wilhelm Killing for spheres, [33]. Heinrich Liebmann proved two properties
that established this potential as the natural extension of the Newtonian model
to spaces of constant curvature. At the turn of the 20th century, he showed that
the cotangent potential in the case of the Kepler problem (the motion of one body
about a ﬁxed attractive centre) is a harmonic function in the 3-dimensional (but
not in the 2-dimensional) case and that every bounded orbit is closed, [39], [40].
The same properties are true in the classical problem, [5]. Although attempts
at other extensions of the Newtonian potential to spaces of constant curvature

Central conﬁgurations of the curved N -body problem

5

existed, they were short-lived. Robert Lipschitz, for instance, proposed such a
model, but his solution to the Kepler problem involved elliptic integrals, so it
could not be explicitly expressed, [41].

More recently, work in this direction was pursued by the Russian school of ce-
lestial mechanics, especially for the equations describing the motion of two bodies,
which unlike in the Euclidean case are not integrable, [34], [58]. In the past few
years the problem was intensely researched in the general case of N bodies, using
various forms of the equations of motion, both in extrinsic and intrinsic coordi-
nates. The chosen topics orbited around ﬁnding new relative equilibria, as well
as rotopulsators (the solutions that generalize the concept of homographic orbits)
and establishing their properties, including various types of stability, [7], [8], [9],
[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [23], [29], [45], [46],
[49], [51], [62], [63], [64], [66].

One other reason for pursuing these topics is related to possible applications
towards deciding whether space is elliptic, ﬂat, or hyperbolic. This question was
already asked by Lobachevsky and Gauss. The former used observations on the
Earth’s parallax, while the latter measured the angles of a triangle formed by
three mountain peaks, apparently hoping to see whether their sum was below
or above π radians. But none of them succeeded to provide an answer since
the observation and measurement errors were larger than the potential deviation
of the physical space from zero curvature, [35]. Bernhard Riemann’s advance
in diﬀerential geometry was also motivated by this question in connection with
the general relationship between physics and the geometry of the universe, [52].
Many other attempts to solve this problem were made in the mean time, including
the so-called boomerang experiment, which analyzed the cosmological background
radiation, [4]. All of them, however, failed to provide a deﬁnite answer on whether
the physical space is ﬂat or not.

A potential way to oﬀer a solution to this problem would be to mathematically
ﬁnd stable orbits that exist in, say, ﬂat space, but not in hyperbolic and elliptic
space, and then seek them in the universe through astronomical observations. A
successful attempt of this kind could determine the geometric nature of the physi-
cal space. In fact, a small step in this direction was already made by showing that
the Lagrangian relative equilibria of the 3-body problem appear only in the Eu-
clidean space for nonequal masses, while it is well known that such orbits exist in
the solar system, such as the equilateral triangles formed by the Sun, Jupiter, and
any of the Trojan asteroids, [18]. But we don’t know yet whether some quasiperi-
odic orbits of nonequal masses, for instance, come close to Lagrangian solutions in
curved space, such that it could be hard to distinguish between the two. Proving
that such quasiperiodic orbits don’t exist would oﬀer a strong argument that our

6

universe is ﬂat. At this point, however, we don’t seem to have the analytical tools
to address this problem.

1.4. Our goal. In this paper we extend the concept of central conﬁguration to
the N-body problem in spaces of constant Gaussian curvature. Our idea was to
ﬁnd a formal deﬁnition that resembles the classical one. To achieve this goal we
had to formulate ﬁrst the correct deﬁnition of the moment of inertia for 3-spheres
and hyperbolic 3-spheres, such that it agrees with the standard deﬁnition known
in the Euclidean space. This step proved more diﬃcult than we expected, also
because of a terminological mixup that had occurred in the past few decades in
the literature pertaining to the Newtonian N-body problem. A main obstacle
was that, in the 3-dimensional case, the deﬁnition of the moment of inertia we
considered suitable for our purposes did not match the one in the Euclidean space
when the curvature takes the value zero. But in the end we found a way out with
the help of the concept of locked inertia tensor used in geometric mechanics and
thus clariﬁed the semantic confusion that had occurred in recent years.

We also wanted to develop some criteria for the existence of central conﬁgura-
tions and apply them towards ﬁnding new classes of such mathematical objects.
The reward was higher than expected when we understood that any central con-
ﬁguration on a 3-sphere delivers two classes of relative equilibria, whereas any
central conﬁguration on hyperbolic 3-spheres provides three such classes. Unlike
in the Euclidean case, however, central conﬁgurations do not lead to homothetic
orbits, in general. The loss of this property is not only because spheres and hyper-
bolic spheres are not vector spaces, so the concept of similarity doesn’t make much
sense, but also for dynamical reasons. In Euclidean space, bodies released from
a central conﬁguration with zero initial velocities collide simultaneously. While
this happens in some highly symmetric cases in curved space as well, it doesn’t
happen in general. For example, for ﬁxed points on spheres, which are central
conﬁgurations, the bodies don’t move at all.

We also included in this ﬁrst paper on central conﬁgurations of the curved N-
body problem a complete proof that for any masses on spheres and hyperbolic
spheres central conﬁgurations exist. Finally, we added some results on the number
of geodesic central conﬁgurations, in the spirit of the classical theorem proved by
Forest Ray Moulton in the classical case, [50].

1.5. Summary and organization. We will further summarize our results in the
context of how the rest of this paper is organized. In Section 2 we discuss the
concept of moment of inertia in Euclidean space and point out that some confusion
occurred during the past few decades in celestial mechanics on what really this
means. Our discussion is necessary for two reasons; ﬁrst, we need to clarify the
concept in Euclidean space such that we can ﬁnd a way to deﬁne it in spaces

Central conﬁgurations of the curved N -body problem

7

of constant curvature; second, once we understand how to deﬁne it for nonzero
curvature, we need to recover the deﬁnition given in Euclidean space when the
curvature tends to zero. In Section 3 we perform this task by starting from the
notion of locked inertia tensor, which is a generalization of the moment of inertia
for any manifold. After that we ﬁnd the correct deﬁnitions for the moment of
inertia for 3-dimensional spheres and hyperbolic spheres and see that they agree
with the deﬁnition known in Euclidean space.

In Section 4 we introduce the equations of motion of the curved N-body problem
and their integrals of motion. We point out that the value of the curvature is
irrelevant when dealing with qualitative results and that only its sign matters.
Therefore we can consider the motion of the particle system only on the unit
sphere and the unit hyperbolic sphere, an approach we use for the rest of the
paper. Section 5 is devoted to relative equilibria, solutions of the equations of
motion for which the particle system behaves like a rigid body. We show that
there are ﬁve classes of relative equilibria on 3-dimensional spheres and hyperbolic
spheres, as they naturally follow from the isometry groups of these spaces. We end
this section with some examples of relative equilibria, which suggest that we can
recover these solutions from conﬁgurations we take at some given time instant.
In Section 6 we then develop two criteria for the existence of relative equilibria,
one for the sphere and the other for the hyperbolic sphere, and establish the
relationship between relative equilibria and the locked inertia tensor through the
concept of mechanics systems with symmetry, ﬁrst introduced by Smale, [61].
This relationship conﬁrms our deﬁnition for the moment of inertia.

These results prepare us for what follows in Section 7, where we can ﬁnally
deﬁne the concept of central conﬁguration using the two previous criteria proved
for the existence of relative equilibria. Unlike in Euclidean space, we can introduce
the new class of special central conﬁgurations on the sphere (as opposed to what
we call ordinary central conﬁgurations), which stems from the fact that ﬁxed-point
solutions occur in this case. No such central conﬁguration exist on the hyperbolic
sphere. We also deﬁne the new notions of geodesic, S2, S3, H 2, and H 3 central
conﬁgurations and ﬁnd some of their properties. An important tool for classifying
central conﬁgurations is that of equivalence classes, which we introduce in Section
8, where we also prove several results about them, including ways to reduce their
study to convenient settings.

In Section 9 we prove two criteria for the existence of central conﬁgurations, one
in S3 and the other in H 3, and compute the value of the constant λ involved in the
deﬁnition of central conﬁgurations. Section 10 is devoted to proving the existence
of central conﬁgurations in S3 and H 3 for any given point masses. For this purpose
we look at central conﬁgurations seen as critical points of the potential in spaces
of constant curvature. We also extend here the Wintner-Smale conjecture from

8

Florin Diacu, Cristina Stoica, and Shuqiang Zhu

the Euclidean space to S3 and H 3. In Section 11 we prove a result about central
conﬁgurations that is in a way an analogue of the centre of mass property known
in the classical case. Section 12 presents many examples of central conﬁgurations
and discusses the relative equilibria that correspond to them. The investigation of
whether Moulton’s theorem about the number of collinear central conﬁgurations
in Euclidean space can be extended to spaces of nonzero constant curvature is
the subject of Section 13. We show that the theorem is true in H 3, but fails to
generalize to S3, where even the case of two bodies leads to a complicated count.
Finally, Section 14 draws some conclusions and maps some further directions of
research.

2. The moment of inertia in Euclidean space

In this section we will discuss the notion of moment of inertia in Euclidean
space, aiming to ﬁnd a proper deﬁnition of this concept for an N-body system in
spaces of constant curvature, a goal we will achieve in the next section. At this
stage we do not need any equations of motion, since the moment of inertia does
not depend on them. The reason for dealing with this issue here is related to the
fact that we will use this concept later in the deﬁnition of central conﬁgurations.

2.1. The physical concept. The moment of inertia ﬁrst appeared under this
name in one of Euler’s works of 1765, [26]. On page 166, he wrote in Latin:
“Momentum inertiae corporis respectu eujuspiam axis est summa omnium pro-
ductorum, quae oriuntur, si singula corporis elementa per quadrata distantiarum
suarum ab axe multiplicentur.” The term apparently made it into dictionaries
sometime between 1820 and 1830, [24]. In the spirit of Euler, we can deﬁne this
concept as follows.

Deﬁnition 1. The moment of inertia is the sum of the products of the mass and
the square of the perpendicular distance to the axis of rotation of each particle in
a body rotating about an axis.

According to the above deﬁnition, given above for a rigid body, the moment
of inertia I for a system of N point masses, m1, . . . , mN , relative to the z-axis in
some xyz-coordinate system of the Euclidean space R3, must be of the form

mi(x2

i + y2

i ),

(1)

I =

NXi=1

where the position of the body mi is given by the vector qi = (xi, yi, zi). The
moment of inertia has the same expression (1) if we restrict the motion to the
plane R2 and assume that the rotation takes place about the origin of some xy-
coordinate system, where the position vector for the body mi is now qi = (xi, yi).

Central conﬁgurations of the curved N -body problem

9

In celestial mechanics, as long as the motion is restricted to R2, the moment of
inertia is taken as in (1) or, sometimes, as half this quantity. We will soon clarify
the reason for which some authors introduce the factor 1
2, but it is more important
for now to note that in celestial mechanics the moment of inertia is taken in R3
as

(2)

I =

mi(x2

i + y2

i + z2
i )

nXi=1

or as half this quantity. The usual physical interpretation of formula (2) given in
the ﬁeld is that the moment of inertia provides a crude measure for the distribution
of the bodies in space, with I = 0 at total collision and I large if at least one
body is far away from the others. So not only that there is no match between
Deﬁnition 1 and formula (2), but the celestial mechanics literature never hints at
any connection between the moment of inertia thus deﬁned and the rotation of
the bodies about an axis.

We thought that we might ﬁnd a reason for this mismatch in the original works
where formula (2) appeared. The moment of inertia for the classical N-body prob-
lem has been historically known for its presence in the Lagrange-Jacobi equation,

¨I = (2α + 4)U + 4h,

where I is deﬁned as in (2), U is the force function (i.e. the negative of the
potential energy),

U : R3N → (0,∞), U(q1, . . . , qN ) = X1≤i<j≤N

mimj

|qi − qj|α ,

h is the energy constant, and α > 0 is also a constant. The physical units are
chosen such that the gravitation constant is 1. Since the right hand-side of the
Lagrange-Jacobi formula has a factor of 2, some researchers in celestial mechanics
prefer to introduce the factor 1
2 in the deﬁnition of I, but this detail is irrelevant.
So a good place to start our attempt at answering the above question was the
ﬁrst work that contained the Lagrange-Jacobi equation.

2.2. Jacobi’s approach. In the winter semester of 1842-43 at the University
of K¨onigsberg in East Prussia, Carl Gustav Jacobi gave a lecture series on the
N-body problem, which was very well received, so he published it as a book
entitled “Vorlesungen ¨uber Dynamik” (Lectures on Dynamics) in 1848, [31]. On
page 22, the Lagrange-Jacobi equation appears for the ﬁrst time. To write this
i . He never
attached a name to this sum, as he did for other important concepts, such as
kinetic energy, which he called “lebendige Kraft” (living force). Between pages
i as “Ausdruck” (expression), “Summe” (sum), or

relation he used the quantityP mir2
22 and 24 he referred toP mir2

i , where he took r2

i = x2

i + y2

i + z2

10

“Gr¨osse” (quantity), but never hinted that it has anything to do with the moment
of inertia deﬁned in physics. Recall that this concept had been deﬁned in 1765
and was already in dictionaries around 1830, so Jacobi should have been aware of
it by the time of his lectures.

In the ﬁrst paragraph on page 24, he mentioned that, at the origin of the coor-
i is constant,
the bodies can be thought of lying on the same sphere. So he formulated there
our current physical interpretation of the moment of inertia in celestial mechanics
as a crude measure of the bodies’ distribution in space. And this is all he wrote
i . It is thus reasonable to think that he made no connection

i reaches its minimum value and, whenP mir2

relative to P mir2

between this expression and the the rotation of the bodies about a ﬁxed axis.

2.3. Wintner’s terminology. A century later, Aurel Wintner published the ﬁrst
edition of his inﬂuential book on the analytical foundations of celestial mechanics,
updated in a second edition that appeared in 1947, [65]. On page 234, the quan-
i was introduced (with ξi having the same meaning as Jacobi’s ri
mentioned above), which ﬁnally bears a name; he called it the polar inertia mo-
mentum. In modern parlance, the polar moment of inertia, or the polar moment
of area, is a quantity used to predict an object’s resistance to torsion. Physicists
warn, however, that the polar moment of inertia should not be confused with
the moment of inertia, which characterizes an object’s angular acceleration due
to torque. So though related, the concepts of torque and torsion mean diﬀerent
things.

2.4. More recent developments. Since the publication of Wintner’s book, re-
searchers in celestial mechanics got apparently mixed up in terminology. Though
the two physical concepts are identical in the classical N-body problem as long as
I is deﬁned in the plane R2, in R3 we must distinguish between the polar moment
of inertia, (2), and the moment of inertia, (1). This remark is important to us for
reasons related to the deﬁnition we will give for central conﬁgurations in spaces
of constant curvature and to the fact that we can recover the classical deﬁnition
when the curvature tends to zero.

In spite of a misleading terminology, the polar moment of inertia was understood
in terms of a rotation when considered in the context of relative equilibria (orbits
that maintain constant mutual distances between the bodies all along the motion)
deﬁned by central conﬁgurations, as we will explain in a later section. But the
central conﬁgurations leading to relative equilibria must be planar, (see [65], p.
287). As there are no spatial relative equilibria in R3, the mixup between concepts
was harmless. In the next section, we will provide and justify the correct deﬁnition
of the moment of inertia for spheres and hyperbolic spheres, and later ﬁnd another
way to back up our ﬁndings.

3. The moment of inertia in spaces of constant curvature

In this section we will obtain the expression of the moment of inertia on spheres
and hyperbolic spheres using the language of geometric mechanics, [1], [43], [44].
We will obtain the same expression for the moment of inertia for diﬀerent types
of rotations, as expected from the considerations of the previous section.

3.1. The locked inertia tensor. To deﬁne the moment of inertia in spaces of
constant curvature, we will apply the more general concept of locked inertia tensor,
introduced in [43]. For this purpose, consider as a conﬁguration space a manifold
M endowed with an inner product ≪ , ≫T M on its tangent bundle T M. Let G
be a Lie group that acts on M. Denote by g the Lie algebra of G. Each ξ ∈ g
generates a vector ﬁeld on M as follows: Write the action of g ∈ G on a column
vector q ∈ M simply as gq; the vector at q, denoted by ξM (q), is obtained by
diﬀerentiating gq with respect to g in the direction of ξ at g = e. Explicitly,

Notice that the integral curves of this vector ﬁeld are in fact group orbits of the
G action on M. Denote by g∗ the linear space dual to g. For each q ∈ M, the
locked inertia tensor is the linear map

I(q) : g → g∗,

hI(q)ξ, ηig =≪ ξM (q) , ηM (q) ≫T M ,

(3)
where ξ, η ∈ g, and h·,·ig is the natural pairing between g and g∗. Recall that
the natural pairing between a vector space V and its dual V ∗ is a real number,
hf, viV := f (v), for each f ∈ V ∗ and v ∈ V , where f (v) is deﬁned in a natural
way, speciﬁc to each vector space V .

For our purpose we consider the manifold M embedded in a higher dimensional
inner product vector space, take G to be a matrix Lie group acting on the vector
space, and understand the action of the matrix Lie group G on M as the induced
action. We denote by q both the (column) vectors in the embedding inner-product
space and their representation in the embedded space M. Then it is easy to see
that the vector ﬁeld generated by ξ ∈ g at q is simply ξq, i.e., the product of the
matrix ξ with the column vector q.
The manifolds we are interested are embedded in either the standard Euclidean
space, R4, or the Minkowski space, R3,1. We regard these two spaces as R4,
each endowed with its own inner product. More precisely, for some two vectors
q1 = (x1, y1, z1, w1)T and q2 = (x2, y2, z2, w2)T in R4 or R3,1, the inner products
are given by

q1 · q2 = x1x2 + y1y2 + z1z2 + σw1w2,

where σ = 1 for R4 and σ = −1 for R3,1. Then the family of manifolds are

κ := {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4 | x2 + y2 + z2 + σw2 = κ, κ 6= 0},

with w > 0 for κ < 0. For κ > 0, the manifolds are 3-spheres, which we denote by
S3
κ, whereas for κ < 0, the manifolds are hyperbolic 3-spheres, which we denote
by H 3

κ. Let

TqM 3

κ = {v = (vx, vy, vz, vw)T | xvx + yvy + zvz + σwvw = 0}

be the tangent space to M 3

For our purpose, we compute the locked inertia tensor associated to the Lie sub-

not compute it for ξ3 will become clear soon.

hyperbolic rotations,

which diﬀer from the above one, as in the case of the sphere, only in a multiplica-
tive coeﬃcient and an additive constant.

3.4. Deﬁnition of the moment of inertia. We can now end this section with
the following natural deﬁnition of the moment of inertia for the N-body problem
in spaces of constant Gaussian curvature.

Deﬁnition 2. Consider N point masses, m1, . . . , mN , which move in M 3
κ under a
law deﬁned by a potential function, and assume that their conﬁguration is given

Central conﬁgurations of the curved N -body problem

by the vectors qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T ∈ M 3
the particle system is the function

κ, i = 1, N. Then the moment of inertia of

(7)

I(q) :=

i ).

The moment of inertia and the locked inertia tensor thus diﬀer from each other
only in a multiplicative coeﬃcient and an additive constant. We distinguish them
from the polar moment of inertia, which is usually deﬁned in celestial mechanics
in the Euclidean case. Of course, it isn’t necessary to deﬁne the moment of inertia
in other directions than the ones used above since, according to Euler’s ﬁxed axis
theorem, we have already covered all possibilities. We will return to this concept
in Section 7 in the context of central conﬁgurations, where we will see that formula
(7) is essential for our purposes.

4. Equations of motion

In this section we introduce the N-body problem in spaces of constant nonzero
curvature, which we will refer to as the curved N-body problem, in contrast to its
analogue in Euclidean space, which we will call the Newtonian N-body problem.
As in [9], we set the curved N-body problems in the unit 3-sphere and the unit
hyperbolic 3-sphere as Hamiltonian systems in the Euclidean space R4 and in the
Minkowski space R3,1, respectively, with holonomic constraints that restrict the
motion of the bodies to these manifolds.

Recall that R4 and R3,1 are endowed with diﬀerent inner products:
vectors, q1 = (x1, y1, z1, w1)T and q2 = (x2, y2, z2, w2)T , they are given by

for two

q1 · q2 = x1x2 + y1y2 + z1z2 + σw1w2,

where σ = 1 for the Euclidean space and σ = −1 for the Minkowski space. Then
the unite sphere S3 and the unit hyperbolic sphere H 3 are

S3 := {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4 | x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = 1} and
H 3 := {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4 | x2 + y2 + z2 − w2 = −1, w > 0},

respectively. We can merge these two manifolds into

M 3 := {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4 | x2 + y2 + z2 + σw2 = σ, with w > 0 for σ = −1}.
Given the positive masses m1, . . . , mN , whose positions are described by the
conﬁguration q = (q1, . . . , qN ) ∈ (M 3)N , qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i = 1, N, we deﬁne
the singularity set

∆ = ∪1≤i<j≤N{q ∈ (M 3)N ; qi · qj = ±σ}.

16

Florin Diacu, Cristina Stoica, and Shuqiang Zhu

If dij is the geodesic distance between the point masses mi and mj, we deﬁne the
force function U (−U being the potential function) on (M 3)N \ ∆ as

U(q) := X1≤i<j≤N

mimjctndij,

where ctn(x) stands for cot(x) in S3 and coth(x) in H 3. We also introduce two
more notations, which unify the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions,

sn(x) = sin(x) or sinh(x), csn(x) = cos(x) or cosh(x).

Then the distance dij is given by the expression

where arccsn(x) is the inverse function of csn(x). We deﬁne the kinetic energy as

dij := arccsn(σqi · qj),

i ∈ R4∗, a row vector, is the momentum of this system, and R4∗

p1 · p2 = ux1ux2 + uy1uy2 + uz1uz2 + σuw1uw2.

where piqi stands for the matrix multiplication of the 1 × 4 matrix and the 4 × 1
matrix, and ∇qiU stands for the gradient of U on the manifold (S3)N . Note that
the gradient can be interpreted as the attractive force on qi produced by all the
other particles and −m−1
i (pi · pi)qi can be viewed as the constraint force keeping
the particles on the sphere. Thus we denote ∇qiU and ∇qimimj cot dij by Fi and
Fij, respectively, so we have

Remark 1. Some researchers studied the curved N-body problem on spheres and
hyperbolic spheres with curvature κ 6= ±1 [32], i.e., in

S3

κ = {(x, y, z, w) ∈ R4 | x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = κ−1} κ > 0,

H 3

κ = {(x, y, z, w) ∈ R4 | x2 + y2 + z2 − w2 = κ−1, w > 0} κ < 0.

This is not necessary since it has been shown in [9] that there are coordinate and
time-rescaling transformations,

qi = |κ|−1/2ri, i = 1, N and τ = |κ|3/4t,

which bring the systems from S3

κ and H 3

κ to systems to S3 and H 3, respectively.

4.1. Total angular momentum integrals. The Hamiltonian function is invari-
ant under the action of SO(4) and SO(3, 1) for motions in S3 and H 3, respectively.

5. Relative equilibria

In this section we introduce the relative equilibria of the curved N-body prob-
lem and classify these solutions into several classes. Although this notion was
considered and analyzed in our previous work (see [9], [10]), we stir our presenta-
tion towards showing some patterns not seen before, which will allow us to later
deﬁne the concept of central conﬁguration. Relative equilibria are orbits of the
form of Q(t)q(0), where Q(t) is a one-parameter subgroup of the isometry group
of the system. We need ﬁrst to take a closer look at the isometric transforma-
tions of M 3, the Lie groups SO(4) and SO(3, 1), such that we can ﬁnd a suitable
deﬁnition for these solutions.

A one-parameter subgroup of SO(4) is of the form P Aα,β(t)P −1, with P ∈

SO(4) and

where α, β ∈ R. As remarked in Section 3, we call these rotations positive elliptic-
elliptic if α 6= 0 and β 6= 0, and positive elliptic if only one of them is zero.
A one-parameter subgroup of SO(3, 1) is of the form P Bα,β(t)P −1 or P Cη(t)P −1,
with P ∈ SO(3, 1), and

hyperbolic, negative elliptic-hyperbolic and parabolic transformations correspond
to α 6= 0 and β = 0, α = 0 and β 6= 0, α 6= 0 and β 6= 0, and η 6= 0, respectively.
We can easily check that

Aα,β(t) = exp(ξ1t), Bα,β(t) = exp(ξ2t), Cη(t) = exp(ξ3t),

where ξ1 ∈ so(4), ξ2, ξ3 ∈ so(3, 1), and

It is easy to see that the curved N-body problem is invariant under the isometry
group of M 3, which implies that for any φ in the isometry group, (q(t), p(t)) solves
the curved N-body problem if and only if φ (q(t), p(t)) does. Thus we do not lose
anything by deﬁning the concept of relative equilibrium for the curved N-body
problem with the three normal forms of orthogonal matrices. To simplify the
notation, we will denote initial positions without any argument and attach the
argument t to functions depending on time.

Deﬁnition 3. Let q = (q1, . . . , qN ) be a nonsingular initial conﬁguration of the
point particles of masses m1, . . . , mN , N ≥ 2, on the manifold M 3, where the initial
position vectors are qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i = 1, N. Then a solution of the form

q(t) = Q(t)q := (Q(t)q1, . . . , Q(t)qN )

of system (8), with Q(t) being Aα,β(t), Bα,β(t), or Cη(t), is called a relative equi-
librium.

It was shown in [9] and [10] that there exist ﬁve types of relative equilibria:
positive elliptic (α = 0 or β = 0, but not both, in Aα,β(t)), positive elliptic-elliptic
(α 6= 0, β 6= 0 in Aα,β(t)), negative elliptic (α 6= 0, β = 0 in Bα,β(t)), negative
hyperbolic (α = 0, β 6= 0 in Bα,β(t) ), negative elliptic-hyperbolic (α 6= 0, β 6= 0 in
Bα,β(t)), and there are no relative equilibria corresponding to Cη(t). Consequently,
from now on we will ignore the elements of the form Cη(t) in SO(3, 1) and deal
only with those of the form Bα,β(t). This is why we did not compute the locked
inertia tensor associated to ξ3.

5.1. Examples of relative equilibria. The existence of several classes of rela-
tive equilibria is proved in [9] and [10]. We present here some particular examples.
Some straightforward computations, or the criteria we give in Section 6, conﬁrm
their existence. The reason for presenting these examples will soon become clear.
Example 1. On S3, let us place three equal masses m1 = m2 = m3 = 13√39
q = (q1, q2, q3), qj = (xj, yj, zj, wj)T , j = 1, 2, 3, where

cos βj, yj =

sin βj, zj =

.

√3
2

Then the computations show that q(t) = A1,0(t)q is a positive elliptic relative
equilibrium and q(t) = A√2,1(t)q is a positive elliptic-elliptic relative equilibrium.
Example 2. On H 3, let us place three equal masses m1 = m2 = m3 = 8√2
q = (q1, q2, q3), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i = 1, 2, 3, where

9 at

x1 = 0,

x2 = 1,
x3 = −1,

y1 = 0,

y2 = 0,

y3 = 0,

z1 = 0,

z2 = 0,

z3 = 0,

w1 = 1
w2 = √2
w3 = √2.

Then the computations show that q(t) = B1,0(t)q is a negative elliptic relative
equilibrium, q(t) = B(t)0,1q is a negative hyperbolic relative equilibrium, and
q(t) = B1/2,√3/2(t)q is a negative elliptic-hyperbolic relative equilibrium.

Notice that in each example the relative equilibria can be generated from the
same initial conﬁguration. Far from being a coincidence, this fact will be clariﬁed
in Section 7.

6. Existence criteria for relative equilibria

In this section, we derive criteria for the existence of relative equilibria. They
are equivalent with the criteria we gave in [9] and [10], but diﬀer signiﬁcantly in
form, and will be essential in deﬁning the concept of central conﬁguration.

Let

q = (q1, ..., qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T ,

i = 1, N,

be a nonsingular conﬁguration in (M 3)N and Q(t)q a relative equilibrium, where
Q(t) is Aα,β(t) or Bα,β(t). Again, to simplify the notation, we will denote ini-
tial positions and velocities without any argument and attach the argument t to
functions depending on time.

To rewrite the criteria proved in [9] and [10] in matrix form, we ﬁrst substitute

qi(t) = Q(t)qi, i = 1, N, into equations (8) and obtain

mi ¨Q(t)qi = ∇qiU(t) − σmi[ ˙Q(t)qi ·

6.1. Criterion for relative equilibria in S3. We can now prove the following
criterion for the existence of relative equilibria in S3.

Criterion 1. Let q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i = 1, N, be a nonsingu-
lar conﬁguration in S3. Then Aα,β(t)q is a relative equilibrium if and only if this
conﬁguration satisﬁes the equations

More precisely, the relative equilibria we obtain are

(i) positive elliptic if α 6= 0 and β = 0 or if α = 0 and β 6= 0;
(ii) positive elliptic-elliptic if α 6= 0 and β 6= 0.

Proof. Using the fact that Aα,β(t) = exp(ξ1t) and that exp(ξ1t) and ξ1 commute,
straightforward computations show that

6.3. Relative equilibria and the locked inertia tensor. In this subsection
we take a slightly diﬀerent point of view. We will apply a general theorem about
mechanical systems with symmetry to obtain a new criterion for the existence of
relative equilibria for the curved N-body problem and then show that this new
criterion agrees with the ones proved in the last two subsections.

Consider a mechanical system of the form K +V “kinetic plus potential energy”
on some manifold M, where the kinetic energy K is generated by the inner product
≪ , ≫T M on the tangent bundle of M. Let a Lie group G acting on M preserve the
kinetic energy K and the potential V . As mentioned earlier, for each ξ belonging
to the Lie algebra g of G, there is a vector ﬁeld ξM . Denote by ξM (q) the vector
at q ∈ M. Then relative equilibria of the mechanical system are solutions of the
equations of motion of the system, in the form of exp(ξt)q, where gq means the
action of g ∈ G on q. In other words, the relative equilibria are both solutions of
the system and integral curves of the vector ﬁeld ξM . Then there is a theorem due
to Smale, which states that relative equilibria can be found by determining, for
each ξ ∈ g ﬁxed, the critical points q(ξ) of the so-called eﬀective (or augmented)
potential ([43], p. 80, [61]), namely the function

2 hI(q) ξ , ξig ,

where Iis the locked inertia tensor deﬁned in Section 3. Once such a critical point
q(ξ) is found, the relative equilibrium is given by q(t) = exp(ξt)q(ξ).

The curved N-body problem is a (K + V )-type mechanical system on (M 3)N ,

with V (q) = −U(q), and the kinetic energy is generated by the inner product

≪ u , v ≫=

NXi=1

where u, v ∈ Tq(M 3)N , u = (u1,· · · , uN ), v = (v1,· · · , vN ), and ui · vi stands
for the dot products in R4. The matrix Lie group, either SO(4) (so(4) being the
Lie algebra) or SO(3, 1) (so(3, 1) being the Lie algebra), acts on (R4)N diagonally,
where we understand the action on (M 3)N of the groups as the induced action. It
is easy to see that these actions preserve the kinetic and potential functions. As
mentioned, without loss of generality, we can put relative equilibria in the form

exp(ξ1t)q, exp(ξ2t)q,

where ξ1 and ξ2 are deﬁned in Section 5. Then the vector ﬁelds generated by ξ1
and ξ2 on (S3)N and (H 3)N are simply ξ1q and ξ2q, respectively, where ξ1 and ξ2
are 4N ×4N block diagonal matrices. Now we can compute the eﬀective potential
to get a new criterion for the existence of relative equilibria.
Recall that the deﬁnition of the moment of inertia for a conﬁguration q =

(q1,· · · , qN ), qi ∈ M 3 is

I(q) :=

Criterion 3. Let q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i = 1, N, be a nonsin-
gular conﬁguration in S3. Then exp(ξ1t)q = Aα,β(t)q is a relative equilibrium if
and only if this conﬁguration satisﬁes the equations

conﬁguration satisﬁes the equations

α2 + β2

2 ∇qiI(q) = ∇qiU(q).

−

Proof. Recall that for one point mass m at q = (x, y, z, w)T in S3 or H 3, equations
(5) and (6) imply that

≪ ξ1q , ξ1q ≫T S3 = m(α2 − β2)(x2 + y2) + mβ2,
≪ ξ2q , ξ2q ≫T H 3 = m(α2 + β2)(x2 + y2) + mβ2,

respectively. Then for a conﬁguration q = (q1, . . . , qN ) ∈ (M 3)N , we obtain that

≪ ξ1q , ξ1q ≫T (S3)N =

≪ ξ2q , ξ2q ≫T (H 3)N =

and only if q is a critical point of these eﬀective potentials, which is equivalent to
the two equations as stated in the criterion. This remark completes the proof. (cid:3)

We claim that the gradient of the moment of inertia I matches the left hand
side of the equations in criteria (10) and (11). Indeed, deﬁne f (x, y, z, w) = x2 +y2
as a function from M 3 to R. We employ the trick used to derive the equations

of motion. Extend f to a homogeneous function ¯f of degree zero, deﬁned in the
ambient space R4,

¯f (x, y, z, w) :=

x2 + y2

σ(x2 + y2 + z2) + w2 ,

let e∇ be the gradient in the ambient space, and ∂
the unit sphere. Since ∂ ¯f
straightforward computations show that
∇f (x, y, z, w) = 2[x(w2 + z2), y(w2 + z2),−z(x2 + y2),−w(x2 + y2)]T in T S3,
∇f (x, y, z, w) = 2[x(w2 − z2), y(w2 − z2), z(x2 + y2), w(x2 + y2)]T in T H 3.
Hence we can conclude that ∇qiI(q) is given by

∂r = 0, we obtain (e∇ ¯f )|M 3 = ∇f + ∂ ¯f

∂n be the unit normal vector of
∂n = ∇f . Thus

Thus Criterion 3 agrees with the criteria obtained in the last two subsections.

7. Central configurations

In this section we will introduce central conﬁgurations in S3 and H 3 and show
their connection with relative equilibria. We will also isolate a particular class of
central conﬁgurations that correspond to ﬁxed-point solutions in S3, but which
don’t exist in H 3, and also introduce various other types of central conﬁgurations.
Finally we will provide their physical description.

7.1. Deﬁnition of central conﬁgurations. Recall that the central conﬁgu-
rations of the Newtonian N-body problem are of the form q = (q1, . . . , qN ),
qi = (xi, yi, zi)T , with

∇qiU = λ∇qi X1≤i≤N

mi(x2

i + y2

i + z2

i ),

i = 1, N,

where λ ∈ R is a constant and U is the Newtonian force function. The resemblance
between these conditions and the equations occurring in Criterion 3 for relative
equilibria in M 3 suggests a way to deﬁne central conﬁguration of the curved N-
body problem.

Deﬁnition 4. Assume that the point masses m1, . . . , mN in M 3 have the nonsin-
gular positions given by the vector

q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i = 1, N.

Central conﬁgurations of the curved N -body problem

27

Then q is a central conﬁguration of the curved N-body problem in M 3 if it satisﬁes
the equations

(13)
where λ ∈ R is a constant and I is the moment of inertia. We will further refer
to these conditions as the ﬁrst central conﬁguration equation.

∇qiU(q) = λ∇qiI(q), i = 1, N,

The following class of central conﬁgurations exist in S3 only, [9], [10].

Deﬁnition 5. Consider the masses m1, . . . , mN > 0 in S3. Then a conﬁguration

q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i = 1, N,

is called a special central conﬁguration if it is a critical point of the force function
U, i.e.

(14)

∇qiU(q) = 0, i = 1, N.

To avoid any confusion, we will call ordinary central conﬁgurations those central
conﬁgurations that are not special.

Special central conﬁgurations are obviously central conﬁgurations since they
satisfy equations (13) with either λ = 0 or ∇qiI(q) = 0 for all i = 1, N. We
will further see that special central conﬁgurations diﬀer from ordinary central
conﬁgurations in many ways.

Here is one remark on terminology. These special central conﬁgurations were
introduced in [9] under the name of ﬁxed points. Given such a conﬁguration
q, we see with the help of Criterion 3 that A0,0(t)q is an associated relative
equilibrium, which is a ﬁxed-point solution: q(t) = q, p(t) = 0. This explains the
old terminology. Let us introduce some new terminology as well.

Deﬁnition 6. A central conﬁguration q of the curved N-body problem is called

– a geodesic central conﬁguration if it is lying on a geodesic;
– an S2 central conﬁguration if it is lying on a great 2-sphere;
– an H 2 central conﬁguration if it is lying on a great hyperbolic 2-sphere;
– an S3 central conﬁguration if it is not lying on any great 2-sphere;
– an H 3 central conﬁguration if it is not lying on any great hyperbolic 2-

sphere.

S2 central conﬁgurations and H 2 central conﬁgurations will also be called M 2 central
conﬁgurations.

Central conﬁgurations will play an important role in the study of the curved N-
body problem. For example, they inﬂuence the topology of the integral manifolds
[43, 61], and they are closely related to the relative equilibria.

7.2. Central conﬁgurations and solutions of the curved N -body problem.
Each central conﬁguration gives rise to a family of relative equilibria, which we call
relative equilibria associated to a central conﬁguration. Thus it is advantageous
to seek central conﬁgurations instead of relative equilibria. We ﬁrst introduce the
following notations

S1

xy :={(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4|x2 + y2 = 1, z = w = 0},
zw :={(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4|z2 + w2 = 1, x = y = 0},
zw :={(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4|z2 − w2 = −1, x = y = 0}.

A direct consequence of the central conﬁguration equation deﬁned in (13), (14),

and discussed in Criterion 3 is the following result.

Corollary 1. Consider a central conﬁguration q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T ,
i = 1, N, in M 3. Let λ be the constant in the central conﬁguration equation
∇qiU(q) = λ∇qiI(q).

– If q is an ordinary central conﬁguration in S3, then it gives rise to a one-

parameter family of relative equilibria: Aα,β(t)q with λ = β2−α2

– If q is in H 3, then it gives rise to a one-parameter family of relative equi-
libria: Bα,β(t)q with λ = − α2+β2
– If q is a special central conﬁguration in S3 and not all the particles are in
xy∪ S1
zw, then it gives rise to a one-parameter family of relative equilibria:
Aα,β(t)q with 0 = β2 − α2.
– If q is a special central conﬁguration in S3 and all the particles are in
S1
xy∪ S1
zw, then it gives rise to a two-parameter family of relative equilibria:
Aα,β(t)q with α, β ∈ R.

Before proving this result, let us make the following remark on terminology.
In the literature, the concept of relative equilibrium stands for both the central
conﬁgurations and the rigid motions associated to them, [43, 60]. In this paper,
however, we use the term relative equilibrium only for the rigid motions.

Proof. The ﬁrst two claims are obvious. If q is a special central conﬁguration in
S3, then by Criterion 3, Aα,β(t)q is an associated relative equilibrium if and only
if β2−α2

2 ∇qiI = 0 for all i.
xy∪ S1
xy ∪ S1

There are two possibilities: ﬁrst, if there exists some qi with ∇qiI 6= 0, that is,
there is some qi /∈ S1
zw, then 0 = β2− α2, i.e., q gives rise to a one-parameter
family of relative equilibria: Aα,β(t)q with 0 = β2 − α2; second, if ∇qiI = 0 for
all i, that is, qi ∈ S1
zw for all i, then there is no limitation for α, β, i.e., q
gives rise to a two-parameter family of relative equilibria: Aα,β(t)q with α, β ∈ R.
This remark completes the proof of the statements relative to S3.

(cid:3)

Remark 2. The reader may notice a gap in the proof. For a central conﬁguration
in H 3, we don’t have a one-parameter family of relative equilibria, as claimed,
unless we can show that the value of λ is always negative. This fact will be
proved in Section 9, where the value of λ will be explicitly computed.

Let us notice that while spatial central conﬁgurations of the Newtonian N-body
problem do not have associated relative equilibria, all central conﬁgurations of the
curved N-body problem have associated relative equilibria.

Now it is easy to explain what happens in Examples 1 and 2 of Section 5. In
Example 1, we can check that the given conﬁguration q is a central conﬁguration in
S3 with λ = − 1
2 . Then we obtain the positive elliptic and positive elliptic-elliptic
relative equilibria from it. Similarly, in Example 2, the given conﬁguration q is
a central conﬁguration in H 3 with λ = − 1
2 , and we obtain the negative elliptic,
negative hyperbolic, and negative elliptic-hyperbolic relative equilibria from it.

In the family of relative equilibria associated to one central conﬁguration, there
are motions of diﬀerent characteristics. In S3, the relative equilibria can be pos-
In H 3, they can be negative elliptic,
itive elliptic and positive elliptic-elliptic.
negative hyperbolic, and negative elliptic-hyperbolic. Furthermore, in S3, these

30

rigid motions can be periodic or quasi-periodic unless they stem from a special
central conﬁguration with a body not on S1

zw. Since α/β =p1 − 2λ/β2, the
associated relative equilibria are periodic if we choose β such thatp1 − 2λ/β2 is a
rational number, and they are quasi-periodic if we choose β such thatp1 − 2λ/β2

However, unlike in the Newtonian N-body problem, central conﬁgurations do
not provide us with homothetic solutions, which occur only in vector spaces, since
they require similarity, [65]. Since S3 and H 3 are not vector spaces, we cannot
derive such orbits from central conﬁgurations.

We end this subsection with stating the following property, which is a direct

7.3. A physical description of central conﬁgurations. In this subsection,
we study the vector ﬁeld ∇qiI(q), which provides us with a physical description
of central conﬁgurations and brings restrictions to the conditions imposed on
ordinary S2 and H 2 central conﬁgurations.

Let us start with a result that gives a geometric interpretation of the moment

Let us give some physical interpretation for an ordinary central conﬁguration.
Denote by M 1

conﬁguration is a special position of the particles in M 3 with the property that
the gravitational acceleration vector produced on each particle by all the others
particles points toward the geodesic M 1

By the deﬁnition of special central conﬁgurations, we see that they are special
j=1,j6=i Fij = 0 for each i = 1, N.
This geometrical description of the vector ﬁeld ∇(x2 + y2) brings restrictions to
the condition for ordinary M 2 central conﬁgurations. Recall that they are ordinary
central conﬁgurations lying on a great sphere or a great hyperbolic sphere M 2. Let
q be such a central conﬁguration on M 2. ∇qiU is always tangential to (M 2)N from
how the gravitational law is deﬁned in M 3. But the minimal geodesic connecting qi
zw) may not lie on that particular M 2, thus ∇qiI might not be tangential
and S1
to (M 2)N , which means that the conﬁguration cannot be central. Although we can
ﬁnd restrictions to M 2 following this geometric approach, we will further use an
analytic argument, which is easier to explain.

Proposition 2. Consider the nonempty set

M 2 := {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ M 3 | ax + by + cz + dw = 0},

and suppose that there exists an ordinary central conﬁguration in M 2. Then
(a, b) = (0, 0) or (c, d) = (0, 0).
Proof. Recalling that ∇qiU is a linear combination of the position vectors, we see
that ∇qiU lies on the 3-dimensional space ax + by + cz + dw = 0 in R4. Thus to
have an ordinary central conﬁguration, it is necessary that

∇(x2 + y2) = (x(w2 + σz2), y(w2 + σz2),−σz(x2 + y2),−σw(x2 + y2))T

also lies in this 3-dimensional space, i.e.,

0 = ax(w2 + σz2) + by(w2 + σz2) − cσz(x2 + y2) − dσw(x2 + y2)
= (ax + by)(w2 + σz2) − (cz + dw)(x2 + y2).

Using that ax + by + cz + dw = 0 and (x2 + y2) = σ − σ(w2 + σz2), we obtain

ax + by = 0, cz + dw = 0.

Thus the original 3-dimensional space ax + by + cz + dw = 0 is equivalent to the
intersection of the spaces,

{ax + by = 0, cz + dw = 0, ax + by + cz + dw = 0}.

So the linear space spanned by the three vectors (a, b, 0, 0), (0, 0, c, d), and (a, b, c, d)
is the 1-dimensional space spanned by (a, b, c, d), which implies that we have either
(a, b) = (0, 0) or (c, d) = (0, 0).

8. Equivalent central configurations

In this section we ﬁnd a way to count central conﬁgurations. With a convention
to be introduced soon, we will see that that there are inﬁnitely many central
conﬁgurations for three equal masses on S3. Then we will show that any M 2 central
conﬁguration is equivalent to some central conﬁguration on one of four particular
great 2-spheres, and that any geodesic central conﬁguration is equivalent to some
central conﬁguration on one of two particular geodesics.

Recall that the central conﬁguration equation for the Newtonian N-body prob-

lem in Euclidean space is given by the system

∇qiU(q) = λ∇qi

mi(x2

NXi=1

i + y2

i + z2

i ), i = 1, N,

which is invariant under the Euclidean similarities of R3− dilations and the isom-
etry group O(3). Thus we call two central conﬁgurations q and q′ equivalent if
there is a constant k ∈ R and a 3 × 3 orthogonal matrix Q such that q′i = kQqi,

Central conﬁgurations of the curved N -body problem

33

i = 1, N. So we count central conﬁgurations by counting the corresponding equiv-
alence classes.

Things are diﬀerent for central conﬁgurations of the curved N-body problem is
diﬀerent. First, we do not have dilations since the space M 3 is not linear; second,
while the special central conﬁguration equation, ∇qiU = 0, is obviously invariant
under the group O(4), the ordinary central conﬁguration equation, ∇qiU = λ∇qiI,
is not invariant under the isometry group, a fact implied by Proposition 2. Nev-
ertheless, we can deﬁne equivalent classes of central conﬁgurations using the sub-
group that preserves the central conﬁguration equation.

Deﬁnition 7. Let

q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T ,

i = 1, N,

q′ = (q′1, . . . , q′N ), q′i = (x′i, y′i, z′i, w′i)T ,

i = 1, N,

be two central conﬁgurations in M 3. If q and q′ are special central conﬁgurations,
then we call them equivalent if there is φ ∈ SO(4), such that qi = φq′i, i = 1, N. If
q and q′ are ordinary central conﬁgurations, then we call them equivalent if there
is φ = (φ1, φ2) ∈ SO(2) × SO(2) (SO(2)× SO(1, 1)), such that qi = φq′i for each
i = 1, N, where the action of φ is understood such that φ1 acts on the xy-plane
and φ2 on the zw-plane.

We would like to point out that though the central conﬁguration equation is
actually invariant under the action of O(2) × O(2) or O(2) × O(1, 1), we adopt
this deﬁnition to keep consistency with the critical point formulation, which will
be introduced in Section 10.

Let us now justify the deﬁnition, i.e. show that the central conﬁguration equa-
tion is only invariant under the subgroup O(2) × O(2) or O(2) × O(1, 1). This
is intuitively easy to see since only this subgroup keeps I, the moment of inertia,
invariant. More precisely, let X(q) = ∇qiU(q) − λ∇qiI(q) be the vector ﬁeld on
(M 3)N \ ∆ deﬁned by the central conﬁguration equation, and φ an element of the
isometry group. We need to show that

φ∗X(q) = X(φq) if and only if φ ∈ O(2) × O(2) or O(2) × O(1, 1),

where φ∗ is the tangent map associated to φ and it is just φ since φ is a linear map.
First, note that the force function U depends on the mutual distances between
U(q) and ∇qiU(q) are two (1, 0)
bodies, thus U(q) = U(φq). Notice that ∇q′

Second, notice that I(φq) =P1≤i≤N misn2d(φqi, M 1

8.1. A counting example. Let us now illustrate this convention by counting the
number of central conﬁgurations in the following example of Lagrangian central
conﬁgurations on

S2

xyz := {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4|x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = 1, w = 0},

see Figure 1. These central conﬁgurations have already appeared in Section 5 in
connection with our ﬁrst example of relative equilibria and we will discuss them in
more detail in Section 12. So let us place three equal masses m1 = m2 = m3 = 1
at

q = (q1, q2, q3), qj = (xj, yj, zj, wj)T , j = 1, 2, 3,

xj = √1 − c2 cos βj, yj = √1 − c2 sin βj, zj = c, wj = 0, βj =

2πj
3

,

where c could have any value between −1 and 1. It is easy to verify that these are
all central conﬁgurations. By the convention we introduced, rotating the central
conﬁgurations in the xy-plane does not lead to new central conﬁgurations, and the
rotated ones still remain on the original 2-sphere; rotating them in the zw-plane
does not lead to new central conﬁgurations either, although they will not remain
on the original 2-sphere. Though all these central conﬁgurations are similar in
some sense, there does not exist an element in SO(2)× SO(2) to relate any two of
them. Thus we see that there is an inﬁnite number of equivalent classes of central
conﬁgurations for the three equal masses. In other words, the set they form has
the power of the continuum.

We will see that this property is common for all given masses, and we will
return to this topic after we prove the existence of central conﬁgurations for any
given masses in Section 10.

With the above deﬁnition of equivalent central conﬁgurations, the result in Propo-
sition 2 can be restated as follows.

Theorem 2. Any H 2 central conﬁguration is equivalent to some central conﬁgu-
xzw. Any S2 central conﬁguration is equivalent to some central
xyw or H 2

conﬁguration on S2

xzw. Furthermore, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the central conﬁgurations on S2

xyz and the central conﬁgurations on S2

Proof. The above statement is obvious for special central conﬁgurations. For an
ordinary M 2 central conﬁguration q, by Proposition 2, we assume that it lies on

Let φ = (φ1, id), and

{(x, y, z, w)T ∈ M 3 | cos θ1x + sin θ1y = 0}.
cos(π/2 − θ1) (cid:21) =(cid:20)sin θ1 − cos θ1

φ1 =(cid:20)cos(π/2 − θ1) − sin(π/2 − θ1)

sin(π/2 − θ1)

cos θ1

sin θ1 (cid:21) ∈ SO(2).

Then φ(x, y, z, w)T = (sin θ1x − cos θ1y, 0, z, w). Hence q is equivalent to φq,
which is on S2

xzw (H 2

xzw).

Similarly, we can show that an M 2 central conﬁguration q on

{(x, y, z, w)T ∈ M 3 | cz + dw = 0}

is equivalent to some central conﬁguration on S2

xyw).

Let q be a central conﬁguration on S2

Consider the orthogonal transformation given by

xyz, i.e. ∇qiU(q)− λ∇qiI(q) = 0, i = 1, N.

Then q′i = ϕqi is on S2

xzw and

ϕ(xi, yi, zi, wi) = (zi, wi, xi, yi).

Let us now study the vector ﬁelds ∇(x2 + y2) on great spheres and great hy-

tangential.

xyw, or H 2

xzw is given

{(x, y, z, w)T ∈ M 2 | ax + by + cz + dw = 0}.

Then the vector ﬁeld ∇(x2 +y2) is tangential to this geodesic if and only if (a, b) =
(0, 0) or (c, d) = (0, 0).

Proof. We can use here the same argument as in the proof of Proposition 2. (cid:3)

Let us further denote

S1

xz :={(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4 | x2 + z2 = 1, y = w = 0},
xw :={(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4 | x2 − w2 = −1, y = z = 0}.

xzw can be transformed to S1
xz by some element in SO(2) × SO(2), and each of
those particular geodesics on H 2

by some element in SO(2) × SO(1, 1). Now recall that ∇qiI = 0 if qi ∈ H 1

a geodesic central conﬁguration on H 1

which does not exist. This remark completes the proof.

Consequently, when looking for S2 central conﬁgurations and geodesic central

9. Criteria for central configurations and the value of λ

In this section we rewrite the central conﬁguration equations, both in S3 and
H 3, and state them as existence criteria. For practical purposes, the new equations
are more useful than the original ones. Although we could merge these results
into a single criterion, we prefer to state them separately since this is the way we
apply them. But ﬁrst let us further simplify the notation by taking

i = 1, N.

qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T /∈ S1

Proof. The idea is to decompose the central conﬁguration equation ∇qiU = λ∇qiI
along some basis. For i > k, qi /∈ S1

form an orthogonal basis of R4:

By adding the ﬁrst and third equation we obtain an identity, which means that

Notice that ∇qiU · qi = 0, so the four equations are dependent, thus we can select
three independent ones as follows. Suppose that wi 6= 0, then we take the ﬁrst
three equations since the ﬁrst three components being zero imply that the fourth
is also zero. This remark completes the proof.

But adding the ﬁrst and third equation we obtain an identity, which means that

∇qiU =

Notice that ∇qiU · qi = 0, so the four equations are dependent and we can
select the ﬁrst three independent equations. Since wi ≥ 1, then the ﬁrst three
components being zero imply that the fourth is zero too. This remark completes
the proof.

9.3. The value of λ. A conﬁguration q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T , i =
1, N, is a central conﬁguration if it satisﬁes the central conﬁguration equation (13)
or, equivalently, equation (15) for some constant λ. It turns out that the value
of λ is uniquely determined by the central conﬁguration equation. Recall that
λ = −U/2I for central conﬁgurations of the Newtonian N-body problem. Here
the form of λ is not as nice as that.

The above result also implies that there is no special central conﬁguration on
H 3 that corresponds to the case λ = 0. We can thus conclude that there is no
such central conﬁgurations with qi ∈ H 1

zw for all i = 1, N.

10. Existence of ordinary central configurations

In this section we will interpret central conﬁgurations as critical points of func-
tions related to U, which turns out to be a very useful approach. Then we will
prove the existence of ordinary central conﬁgurations for any given masses. Finally
we will discuss the Wintner-Smale conjecture for the curved N-body problem.

10.1. Central conﬁgurations as critical points. From the ﬁrst central con-
ﬁguration equation,

we can derive the following property.

∇qiU(q) − λ∇qiI(q) = 0,

Proposition 4. Central conﬁgurations in M 3 are critical points of the function

U − λI : (M 3)N \ ∆ → R,

where λ is a constant. In the case of the sphere S3, λ = 0 corresponds to special
central conﬁgurations.

We can also see that an ordinary central conﬁguration is a critical point of the
restriction of U subject to the constraint I = constant. From this point of view,
−λ is a Lagrange multiplier. More precisely, let us denote
Sc := {q ∈ (M 3)N \ ∆| I(q) = c}.

We then have the following result.
Proposition 5. Ordinary central conﬁgurations in M 3 are critical points of U|Sc,
i.e. critical points of

U : Sc → R.

Let q be an ordinary central conﬁguration and φ an element of SO(2)× SO(2)
or SO(2) × SO(1, 1). Then φq is also a central conﬁguration. Thus it follows
that the critical points of U|Sc are not isolated, but rather occur as manifolds
of critical points. Similarly, these special central conﬁgurations are not isolated
either. This fact suggests that we can further look at the central conﬁgurations
as critical points of U subject to a quotient manifold. Note that both U and
(M 3)N are invariant under the isometry group, and the set Sc is invariant under
the subgroup SO(2) × SO(2) or SO(2) × SO(1, 1). We thus have the following
property.

44

Florin Diacu, Cristina Stoica, and Shuqiang Zhu

Proposition 6. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the classes of cen-
tral conﬁgurations and the critical points of the force function ˆU induced by U on
the quotient set

(1) ((S3)N \ ∆)/SO(4) for special central conﬁgurations in S3,
(2) Sc/(SO(2) × SO(2)) for ordinary central conﬁgurations in S3, and
(3) Sc/(SO(2) × SO(1, 1)) for central conﬁgurations in H 3.
Let q in the quotient set be a critical point of ˆU . In the case of special central
conﬁguration on S3, the Hessian of ˆU at q, D2 ˆU (q), is an invariantly deﬁned sym-
metric bilinear form on Tq((S3)N \∆)/SO(4)). For ordinary central conﬁgurations
in S3 and H 3, D2 ˆU (q) is an invariantly deﬁned symmetric bilinear form on Tq ˆSc,
where ˆSc is the quotient set in either (2) or (3) of Proposition 6. The index of
D2 ˆU (q) is the maximal dimension of a subspace of the tangent space on which
this form is negative deﬁnite. A critical point q of ˆU is degenerate whenever the
Hessian has a non-trivial nullspace.

We can now formally introduce the following two concepts.

Deﬁnition 8. A central conﬁguration is degenerate (nondegenerate) provided that
the corresponding critical point q of ˆU is degenerate (nondegenerate).

10.2. The structure of I−1(c). Unlike in the Newtonian N-body problem, where
I = c > 0 is always a (3N − 1)-dimensional ellipsoid, the set I−1(c) may not be
a smooth manifold. To understand the structure of this set, we need the classical
Regular Value Theorem, which we further recall for completeness. Let M,N be
diﬀerentiable manifolds and f : M → N a diﬀerentiable function. Then f is called
a submersion at x ∈ M if its diﬀerential, Dfx : TxM → Tf (x)N , is surjective. In
this case, x is called a regular point and f (x) a regular value. Otherwise, x is
called a critical point and f (x) a critical value. We can now state the following
well known result, [30].
Regular Value Theorem. Let f : M → N be a C r-map, r ≥ 1. If y ∈ f (M) is
a regular value, then f−1(y) is a C r-submanifold of M.

If we further regard the moment of inertia as the smooth map

I : (M 3)N → [0,∞),

we have the following properties.
Lemma 2. Assume that the masses m1, . . . , mN are in S3, and consider c ≥ 0,
i=1 miµi, where µ1, . . . , µN ∈ {0, 1}. Then the set I−1(c) is
a smooth manifold.

10.3. The existence result. The characterization of central conﬁgurations as
critical points provides an easy way to see that ordinary central conﬁgurations
exist, i.e. that the complicated criteria developed earlier always have solutions for
λ 6= 0.
Theorem 4. Assume that the masses m1, . . . , mN are in S3 or H 3. Then for any
positive values these masses take, there is at least one ordinary central conﬁgura-
tion in S3 and at least one ordinary central conﬁguration in H 3.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove the result in H 3.
In general, the manifold I−1(c) is
not compact in this case. However, this changes if we conﬁne all masses to the
hyperbolic circle H 1
xw, since the set I = c > 0 is homeomorphic to an ellipsoid.
Then U deﬁnes a smooth function on the open subset Sc, and the boundary of
Sc is composed of points in the singularity set. Since the ellipsoid is compact
and U → +∞ as q approaches the boundary of Sc, it follows that U attains a
minimum at some non-singular conﬁguration q. This will be a critical point of U
on Sc and hence an ordinary central conﬁguration.

Let is now prove the result in S3. In this case, for the proper value c, Sc is
a compact manifold since (S3)N is compact. The problem is that there are two

types of singularities, since we can write ∆ = ∆+S ∆−, where
∆+ = ∪1≤i<j≤N{q ∈ (S3)N | qi = qj}, ∆− = ∪1≤i<j≤N{q ∈ (S3)N | qi = −qj}.
On ∆+, U is ∞; on ∆− it is −∞. However, we can prove the existence of
central conﬁgurations by ﬁnding a connected component of Sc, whose boundary

where c is a constant of our choice. Then Sc is a smooth manifold. Let us further
choose a conﬁguration q ∈ Sc with all bodies lying near the North Pole (0, 0, 1),
which means that zi > 0, i = 1, N. Denote by J the connected component of the
manifold Sc that contains the conﬁguration q. We claim that the boundary ∂J
of J contains only points from ∆+.
U = {(x, y, z) ∈ S2
V = {(x, y, z) ∈ S2
i=1 mi(x2

xyz | x2 + y2 < c/m1, z > 0},
xyz | x2 + y2 < c/m1, z ≤ 0}.

To prove this claim, we ﬁrst deﬁne the sets

i + y2

Since I(q) =PN

i ) ≥ m1(x2
i + y2
i + y2
x2

i ≤ c/m1, i = 1, N,

is composed of points that lie only in ∆+. To ﬁnd such a connected component,
we further conﬁne the particles to S2

xyz and order the masses such that

0 < c < m1 ≤ · · · ≤ mN ,

which means that for any conﬁguration q ∈ J each body lies either in U or in V.

Let us now suppose that ∂J ∩ ∆− 6= ∅. Then there must exist a conﬁguration
˜q = (˜q1, . . . , ˜qN ) ∈ J such that one body is in U and the another in V, say,
˜q1 ∈ U and ˜q2 ∈ V. Since J is connected, it is also path connected. Then there
is a path in J connecting q and ˜q, so there is a path that connects q2 ∈ U and
˜q2 ∈ V, and this path must lie in U and V. But this is impossible since U ∩V = ∅.
Thus we have veriﬁed our claim that J is a connected component of the compact
manifold Sc whose boundary consists only of points from ∆+.
Therefore U → +∞ as q approaches ∂J . It follows that U attains a minimum
at some conﬁguration q, which is then a critical point of U on Sc, hence an
ordinary central conﬁguration. This remark completes the proof.

10.4. The Wintner-Smale conjecture in spaces of constant curvature.
Notice that the proof in the previous subsection also works for other constant
values of I, namely any ¯c > 0 in H 3 and any ¯c < c in S3, and that these central
conﬁgurations with diﬀerent values of I are not equivalent. Hence there always
exist central conﬁgurations on Sc for c belonging to some open intervals. So we
have the following obvious consequence of the above existence result.

Corollary 5. Assume that the masses m1, . . . , mN are in S3 or H 3. Then for any
positive values these masses take, the set of ordinary central conﬁgurations has
the power of the continuum.

That is to say, if we extend the Wintner-Smale Conjecture (Smale’s 6th prob-
lem), which asks whether for some given masses, m1, . . . , mN > 0, the number
of classes of planar central conﬁgurations for the Newtonian N-body problem is
ﬁnite or not, [60], to the curved N-body problem, i.e. whether for some given
masses, m1, . . . , mN > 0, the number of classes of central conﬁgurations for the
curved N-body problem is ﬁnite or not, then this extension has an obvious and
uninteresting answer. Also, we have already seen that any two masses cannot
form a special central conﬁguration, and that three masses can form special cen-
tral conﬁgurations if and only if the mass triple (m1, m2, m3) belongs to some
subset of (R+)3, [22].
In light of these facts, we can modify the conjecture as
follows.

(1) In the curved N-body problem, for given positive masses m1, . . . , mN and
all possible values of c, is the number of ordinary central conﬁgurations
with I(q) = c ﬁnite?

(2) In the curved N-body problem in S3, for given positive masses m1, . . . , mN ,

is the number of special central conﬁgurations (if they exist) ﬁnite?

We can also formulate this problem as follows.

(1) For given masses m1, ..., mN and all possible c, is the number of critical

points of ˆU on ˆSc ﬁnite?

(2) For given positive masses m1, ..., mN in S3, is the number of critical points

of ˆU on ((S3)N \ ∆)/SO(4) (if they exist) ﬁnite?

We will see in Section 13 that even for two equal masses, m1 = m2 =: m,
there are inﬁnitely many critical points of the function ˆU on ˆSc when c = m.
So the above nontrivial formulation of the Wintner-Smale conjecture in spaces of
constant curvature is not diﬃcult to answer in some particular cases, although
the problem remains very diﬃcult in general.

11. A property of central configurations

Recall that for central conﬁgurations of the Newtonian N-body problem in R3,

the centre of mass of the conﬁguration is set at the origin, i.e.

mixi =

NXi=1

miyi =

NXi=1

NXi=1

mizi = 0.

In this section we will provide an analogue of this property in M 3. However, we
should keep in mind that, in the curved N-body problem, the centre of mass of
a geometric conﬁguration, whatever deﬁnition we take for it, has no dynamical
signiﬁcance. So let us state and prove the following result.
Theorem 5. Let q = (q1, . . . , qN ), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T ∈ M 3, i = 1, N, be an
ordinary central conﬁguration. Then we have the relationships

(18)

mixizi =

NXi=1

Proof. Recall from the ﬁrst central conﬁguration equation given by system (13),
∇qiU = λ∇qiI, i = 1, N, that the i-th equation can be explicitly written as

and consequently

(zixj − xizj) = 2λmixizi, i = 1, N.

Since the central conﬁguration is not a special central conﬁguration, we necessarily
i=1 mixizi = 0. The other relationships can be
(cid:3)

obtained in the same way, a remark that completes the proof.

An obvious application of equations (18) is that of showing with little compu-
tational eﬀort why certain conﬁgurations are not ordinary central conﬁgurations.
But these relationships can be also used to ﬁnd ordinary geodesic central conﬁgu-
rations. In S3, for instance, suppose that the geodesic central conﬁguration is on
xz, and let qi = (sin θi, 0, cos θi, 0)T . Then

For N = 2, the above equations help us ﬁnd the central conﬁgurations, as we will
show in Section 13.

12. Examples

In this section we will produce some examples of central conﬁgurations of the
curved N-body problem in S3 and H 3 and discuss the associated relative equilibria.
Several examples will concern special and ordinary central conﬁgurations for N =
3 that lie on the great sphere S2
xyw. It is
known that in the Newtonian N-body problem there are only two classes of central
conﬁgurations for N = 3, the Lagrangian (equilateral triangles) and the Eulerian
(collinear conﬁgurations). For nonzero constant curvature, however, the set of
central conﬁgurations (and therefore that of relative equilibria) is richer, as we will
further show. We also include in this section examples of central conﬁgurations
for N > 3. Unless otherwise stated, the relative equilibria associated to all these
central conﬁgurations were already found in [9] and [10].

12.1. Acute triangle special central conﬁgurations on S1
xy. Recall that
S1
xy = {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4|x2 + y2 = 1, z = w = 0}. Let us assume that three
masses, m1 = sin2 α
sin2(α+β) , and m3 = 1 form an acute scalene triangle on
S1
xy and are given by the coordinates

sin2 β , m2 = sin2 α

to verify that ∇qiU = 0 for each i = 1, 2, 3, and these conﬁgurations are special
central conﬁgurations.

gives rise to a two-parameter family of associated relative equilibria: Aα,β(t)q,
α, β ∈ R. The rotation in zw-plane does not aﬀect the conﬁguration, so they

equilibria, Aα,0(t)q, α ∈ R.

F1 = F12 + F13 + F14 + F15 + F16 = 0.

By symmetry we obtain that F12 + F13 = 0. For i = 4, 5, 6, since q1 · qi = 0, we
have d1i = π/2 and F1i = m2(qi−cos d1iq1)

= m2qi. Then

sin3 d1i

F14 + F15 + F16 = m2(q4 + q5 + q6) = 0,

hence this is a special central conﬁguration. Since this special central conﬁgura-
tions is on S1
zw, it gives rise to a two-parameter family of associated relative
equilibria, Aα,β(t)q, α, β ∈ R. They are periodic orbits if α/β is rational, but
quasi-periodic orbits if α/β is irrational.

the coordinates are given by

where r2 + z2 = 1, r ∈ (−1, 1). By symmetry, we notice that Fi is pointing
towards the North or South poles and that |Fi| = |Fj|. Comparing this with the
vector ﬁeld ∇(x2 +y2) on S2
xyz (see Figure 2), we see that the central conﬁguration
equation ∇qiU = λ∇qiI is satisﬁed for i = 1, 2, 3.

occur in the above coordinates, it is not diﬃcult to check that the nine equations
of Criterion (4) are satisﬁed. We can also check the existence of this central
conﬁguration by using an argument similar to the one employed in the earlier
examples, that is, Fi and ∇qiI are collinear and the ratios are the same for each
i = 1, 2, 3. By symmetry, F1 = 0 and |F2| = |F3|. Comparing with the vector ﬁeld
∇(x2 + y2) on S2
xyz (see Figure 2), we see that the central conﬁguration equation
∇qiU = λ∇qiI is satisﬁed for i = 1, 2, 3.

To ﬁnd the value of λ, we use equation (16). We have
3 = r2,

x1x2 + y1y2 = x1x3 + y1y3 = 0, x2x3 + y2y3 = −r2.

sin3 d12 = r3, cos d23 = z2 − r2,

sin3 d23 = 8r3|z|3.

cos d12 = z,

12.8. Lagrangian central conﬁgurations in H 2
xyw. Recall that we earlier de-
ﬁned H 2
xyw = {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ R4|x2 + y2 − w2 = −1, z = 0}. Let us assume that
three equal masses, m1 = m2 = m3 =: m > 0, form an equilateral conﬁguration
in H 2

xyw, parallel with the xy-plane, and the coordinates are given by

q = (q1, q2, q3), qi = (xi, yi, zi, wi)T ,

i = 1, 2, 3,

x1 = r,
x2 = −r/2,
x3 = −r/2,

y1 = 0,
y2 = r√3/2,
y3 = −r√3/2,

z1 = 0,

z2 = 0,

z3 = 0,

w1 = w,

w2 = w,

w3 = w,

where r2 − w2 = −1, w ∈ (1, +∞). By symmetry, we notice that Fi is pointing
towards (0, 0, 0, 1) and |Fi| = |Fj|. Comparing with the vector ﬁeld ∇(x2 + y2) on
H 2
xyw (see Figure 3), we see that the central conﬁguration equation ∇qiU = λ∇qiI
is satisﬁed for i = 1, 2, 3.
To compute the value of λ, we use equation (17). Since the conﬁguration is

equilateral, we obtain that

Each of these central conﬁgurations gives rise to one-parameter family of asso-

. These orbits are a new
discovery that has been missed in previous studies, a fact that shows the power
of the central-conﬁguration method for ﬁnding relative equilibria.

Although we build the whole theory of negative-curvature spaces on the hyperbolic-

sphere model H 3, it is convenient to visualize the associated relative equilibria in
the Poincar´e ball model. Recall that the Poincar´e ball model is given by

(cid:18)¯x2 + ¯y2 + ¯z2 < 1, ds2 =

4(d¯x2 + d¯y2 + d¯z2)

1 − (¯x2 + ¯y2 + ¯z2)(cid:19) ,

which can be seen as the perspective projection of the upper 3-dimensional hy-
perboloid viewed from (0, 0, 0,−1). The projection mapping is

¯x =

x

1 + w

, ¯y =

, ¯z =

y

1 + w

z

.

1 + w

This projection mapping shows that the isometries of the SO(2) rotations in the
xy-plane become the rotations in the ¯x¯y-plane, and that the isometries of the
SO(1, 1) rotations in the zw-plane become action moving points from (0, 0,−1)
to (0, 0, 1) or in the opposite direction. Thus the relative equilibria Bα,β(t)q in
the Poincar´e ball model can be viewed as bodies that rotate around the ¯z-axis
and move up or down along the projection of the hyperbolic cylinder

Crρ := {(x, y, z, w)T ∈ H 3 | x2 + y2 = r2},

a spindle-shaped surface (within the framework of this model) for which the hy-
perbolic distance from the ¯z-axis is constant (see Figure 10 on the right), hence the
name “hyperbolic cylinder” we gave to it in previous studies on relative equilibria,
[9], [10].

with r > 0 and r2 − w2 = −1. Given the many zeroes that occur above, it is not
diﬃcult to check that system (5) is satisﬁed. We can also check the existence of this
central conﬁguration by using the argument employed in the earlier examples, that
is, Fi and ∇qiI are collinear and the ratios are the same for each i = 1, 2, 3. By
symmetry, F1 = 0 and |F2| = |F3|. Comparing with the vector ﬁeld ∇(x2 + y2) on
H 2
xyw (see Figure 3), we see that the central conﬁguration equation ∇qiU = λ∇qiI
is satisﬁed for i = 1, 2, 3.
To compute the value of λ, we use equation (17) and the relationships

d12 = d23, r2

1 = 0, r2

2 = r2

x1x2 + y1y2 = x1x3 + y1y3 = 0, x2x3 + y2y3 = −r2.

the Poincar´e ball model, see Figure 11, where the bodies rotate around the ¯z-axis
and move up or down, one along the ¯z-axis, and the other two along the projection
of the hyperbolic cylinder Crρ, thus maintaining constant mutual distances.

13. Moulton’s theorem

In 1910, Forest Ray Moulton sought to extend Euler’s results about the collinear
central conﬁgurations in the Newtonian N-body problem to any number N of
point masses. He showed that for a given ordering of the bodies on a straight
line, there is exactly one class of central conﬁgurations, [50]. In this section we
are asking whether Moulton’s theorem has a natural correspondent in spaces of
nonzero constant curvature. As we will further prove, this extension is true on
geodesics of H 3, but not on geodesics of S3, where even the case N = 2 leads to a
complicated count.

Before we get to the curved N-body problem, let us make some comments about
the Euclidean case. The class of central conﬁgurations in the above statement of
the theorem is meant as the set of central conﬁgurations factorized to homotheties.
So another equivalent way of stating Moulton’s result is to say that, for every
ordering of any given masses with I(q) = constant, there is exactly one central
conﬁguration. This new formulation is the one we adopt here, since the value of
I(q) could never be the same for central conﬁgurations with diﬀerent sizes, as
Deﬁnition 7 implies.

13.1. Geodesic central conﬁgurations in H 3. Theorem 3 states that every
geodesic central conﬁguration in H 3 is equivalent to some geodesic central conﬁg-
uration on H 1
xw.
Expressing the position of each mass mi in terms of the oriented hyperbolic dis-
tance θi ∈ R, i = 1, N, measured from the vertex, (0, 0, 0, 1), we can represent the
position vectors and the distances between bodies as

xw. Thus we assume that the point masses m1, . . . , mN lie on H 1

qi = (sinh θi, 0, 0, cosh θi), dij = |θi − θj|,

i, j = 1, N,

60

respectively. Then the force function and the moment of inertia can be written as

U(q) = X1≤i<j≤N

mimj coth dij and I(q) =

mi sinh2 θi.

NXi=1

By the critical point characterization of central conﬁgurations introduced in
Section 10, we only need to ﬁnd the number of critical points of ˆU on ˆSc for a
constant c > 0. In this case, we have

ˆSc = Sc/SO(2) × SO(1, 1) = Sc = {q ∈ (H 1

xw)N \ ∆| I(q) = c},

ˆU = U,

where ∆ denotes the collision set. Equivalently, we only need to ﬁnd the number
xw)N \ ∆, where λ is ﬁxed. We can now state and
of critical points of U − λI in (H 1
prove the following result.

Theorem 6. For any given point masses m1, . . . , mN > 0 in H 3 and each c > 0,
there are exactly N!/2 geodesic central conﬁgurations with I(q) = c, one for each
ordering of the masses on the geodesic.

Proof. We will follow the idea used to prove the classical theorem of Moulton, [1],
[48], and show ﬁrst that the manifold Sc contains N! components, each homemo-
rphic to an (N − 1)-dimensional disk. We will then prove that the critical points
of ˆU , or equivalently, of U, are local minima on these disks, and ﬁnally show that
there is just one minimum on each such disk.

To prove that each ordering corresponds to an (N −1)-dimensional open disk, it
suﬃces to consider one of the orderings, θ1 < · · · < θN . Denote the corresponding
xw)N → RN ,
component by S′c (see Figure 12). Consider the homemorphism φ : (H 1
φ(θ1,· · · , θN ) = (x1,· · · , xN ), where xi = sinh θi. Then S′c is homemorphic to

{(x1, . . . , xN ) ∈ RN | x1 < · · · < xN ,

NXi=1

mix2

i = c},

which is an (N − 1)-dimensional open disk, [48]. Thus the set Sc has exactly
N! components, each homemorphic to an (N − 1)-dimensional open disk. By
an argument similar to the one in the proof of Theorem 4, we can establish the
existence of a critical point, or a central conﬁguration, on each component.

Denote such a critical point by q′. We will show that q′ must be a local
minimum of U in Sc. For this, we ﬁrst prove that q′ is a local minimum of
U(q) − λI(q) in (H 1
xw)N \ ∆, where λ = λ(q′) < 0 is a constant determined by
equation (17). To reach this goal, we compute the Hessian of U(q) − λI(q) and

We can conclude that Hessq(v, v) > 0 for all v ∈ Tq′(H 1
xw)N \ ∆, so q′ is a local
minimum of U(q)− λI(q) on (H 1
xw)N \ ∆. Then q′ is also a local minimum of the
new function U(q) − λI(q) + λc, restricted to the submanifold Sc. Note that, on
Sc, this new function becomes U. Consequently q′ is a local minimum of U on Sc.
To show that such a minimum of U is unique on each (N − 1)-dimensional open
disk, we can apply a mountain pass theorem, [28]. Assume that there are two such
minima. Connect these two points with a continuous family of curves. As the two
ends are local minima, there must be a local maximum on each curve. Then the
minimum of all these maxima must be a saddle point of U, in contradiction with
the positive deﬁniteness of the Hessian.

Note that a 180◦ rotation in the xy-plane changes the ordering, which means
that we counted each case twice, so there are exactly N!/2 classes of geodesic
central conﬁgurations, a remark that completes the proof.

13.2. Geodesic central conﬁgurations in S3. Unlike in the hyperbolic case,
Moulton’s theorem has no straightforward generalization to S3. We give an exam-
ple of geodesic central conﬁgurations for two masses to show that the number of
central conﬁgurations on Sc depends on the value of c. This example also provides
some degenerate central conﬁgurations, as deﬁned in Section 10, and means that
the corresponding critical points of ˆU on ˆSc are degenerate.

According to Theorem 3, any geodesic central conﬁguration in S3 is equivalent
to some geodesic central conﬁguration on S1
xz. The example we will exhibit is that
of central conﬁgurations for two masses on S1
xz. Special central conﬁgurations
cannot exist under these circumstances since any nonsingular conﬁguration would
force the two masses to lie inside a semicircle, which turns out to be impossible
because such a conﬁguration cannot generate relative equilibria, as proved in [9].
Expressing the positions of m1 and m2 in terms of the oriented spherical distance,
θi ∈ [0, 2π], i = 1, 2, measured from (0, 0, 1, 0) (see Figure 13), we can write the
position vectors as

q1 = (− sin θ1, 0, cos θ1, 0), q2 = (− sin θ2, 0, cos θ2, 0), 0 ≤ θ1 < θ2 ≤ 2π.

Then the force function and the moment of inertia have the form

U(q) = m1m2 cot d12 and I(q) = m1 sin2 θ1 + m2 sin2 θ2,

respectively, where d12 = min{θ2 − θ1, 2π − θ2 + θ1} is the distance between the
bodies. We can also assume, without loss of generality, that θ1 ∈ [0, π/2]. This is
all the preparation we need to state and prove the following result.

Theorem 7. Consider two masses m1 and m2 on S1
as above. Then these bodies can form a central conﬁguration if and only if

xz with positions q1 and q2

(19)

m1 sin 2θ1 + m2 sin 2θ2 = 0 with sin 2θ1 6= 0.

The number of geodesic central conﬁgurations depends on the size I(q) = c of each
conﬁguration and is given in the table below, where M := m1 + m2. The table on
the left is for m1 < m2, whereas the table on the right is for the m1 = m2 =: m.

When the masses are equal and c = m, all central conﬁgurations are degenerate
critical points of U on Sm and the set they form has the power of the continuum.
Proof. In this case, the central conﬁguration equation (13), ∇qiU = λ∇qiI, i =
1, 2, reduces to

where the signs depend on whether d12 equals θ2 − θ1 or 2π − θ2 + θ1. From these

To ﬁnd the number of central conﬁgurations on Sc, we solve the system

m1 sin 2θ1 + m2 sin 2θ2 = 0 with sin 2θ1 6= 0.

of the form c(m1−c)
m2(M−2c) is represented for m1 < m2, on the left, and m1 = m2, on
the right.
Thus having c in this range, we can obtain the values for sin2 θi < 1, i = 1, 2.

which implies that

ˆSm = {θ1 ∈ (0, π/2), θ2 = θ1 + π/2 or θ2 = θ1 + 3π/2}.

Thus d12 = π/2 and ˆU = U = m1m2 cot d12 = 0 on Sm, which means that
all elements of this set are degenerate critical points of U on Sm, so they are
degenerate central conﬁgurations. This remark justiﬁes the values in the above
tables and completes the proof.
(cid:3)

The related problem of ﬁnding relative equilibria on S1

xz has also been considered
by A.A. Kilin, who obtained the same criterion given in the ﬁrst part of Theorem
7, [32].

Remark 3. The complicated count of geodesic central conﬁgurations in S3 is a
consequence of two facts: the boundary of some components in Sc may contain
points in ∆+ and ∆−, which can destroy the existence of critical points on those
components; and the geodesic central conﬁgurations are not necessarily minima
of U on Sc.

14. Conclusions

So far, the only classes of solutions found for the N-body problem in spaces of
constant curvature were relative equilibria and rotopulsators, the latter allowing
dilations and contractions of the conﬁguration, which, of course, failed to maintain
similarity, [14], although, very recently, some numerical results point out to the
existence of choreographies, including the ﬁgure eight solution on the sphere S2,
[49]. However, these studies are only at the beginning, and the current paper
shows that the approach we took here oﬀers another way to answer some of the
natural problems that occur in the qualitative study of the equations of motion
and the dynamics of the solutions.

But most questions related to central conﬁgurations are far from easy, as it also
happens in the Euclidean case. Even ﬁnding all the central conﬁgurations in the
curved 3-body problem, which has been settled in the classical case long time ago,
is not trivial in curved space and requires a separate study. As we have already
seen, new central conﬁgurations, such as the isosceles triangles, or the scalene
triangles on the equator of the sphere, none of which have correspondents in the
Euclidean case, show up. So far, all these central conﬁgurations on S2
xyz lie in
planes parallel with the xy-plane, except for the geodesic ones. But at this point
we have some indication that most triangular central conﬁgurations do not lie in
planes parallel with the xy-plane, and hope to be able to prove this statement in
a future paper. So even for only three bodies, the set of central conﬁgurations of
the curved problem is signiﬁcantly richer than in the Euclidean case, especially in
the case of the sphere.

These investigations hint at the rich dynamics of the curved N-body problem
and show that the questions occurring from its study allow us to view the clas-
sical case from a new perspective. Having now extended the concept of central
conﬁguration to the curved problem, we have a new tool and a new direction of
research, which will hopefully shed more light on the equations of motion that
govern this mathematical model.
