Abstract: We present a next-to-next-to-leading order accurate description of associated
HW production consistently matched to a parton shower. The method is based on reweight-
ing events obtained with the HW plus one jet NLO accurate calculation implemented in
POWHEG, extended with the MiNLO procedure, to reproduce NNLO accurate Born distribu-
tions. Since the Born kinematics is more complex than the cases treated before, we use a
parametrization of the Collins-Soper angles to reduce the number of variables required for
the reweighting. We present phenomenological results at 13 TeV, with cuts suggested by
the Higgs Cross Section Working Group.

Introduction

After the discovery of the Higgs boson in Run I [1, 2], one of the main tasks of the ongoing
LHC Run II is to perform accurate measurements of Higgs properties. This will be done by
a thorough investigation of all Higgs production and decay modes. Higgs boson production
in association with a boson (HV) is the third largest Higgs production mode and so far has
been studied in Run I in diﬀerent channels, including b¯b [3, 4], W W ∗ [5, 6], and τ τ [7].
Furthermore, for Higgs production in association with a Z boson, it has been used to set
bounds on invisible Higgs decay modes [8]. Because of the largest branching ratio of Higgs
to bottom quarks, so far the best signiﬁcance was found in this channel, by both ATLAS
(1.4 σ signiﬁcance) and CMS (2.2 σ signiﬁcance).
It is expected that these results will
quickly improve in Run II, both because of the increased luminosity and the higher energy.
Higgs to bottom quarks is notably diﬃcult because of the very large QCD background from
g → bb, hence it was suggested that associated production is best studied in a boosted
regime [9]. When boosted cuts are applied this channel becomes one of the most promising
places to constrain the bottom Yukawa coupling.

In ref. [10] the inclusive HV (V = W, Z) cross section was computed at NNLO. In
refs. [11, 12] a fully diﬀerential NNLO calculation of HV including all Drell-Yan type con-
tributions has been presented. The impact of top-quark loops at this perturbative order
has also been investigated in ref. [13]. In ref. [14] NLO corrections to the H → bb decay
were combined with the NNLO corrections to the production. NLO electroweak correc-
tions are also known [15] and available in the public code HAWK. Recently, in ref. [16] a
NNLO calculation of HV was presented, that includes both Drell-Yan type and top Yukawa
contributions, and that includes decays of the vector bosons and of the Higgs boson to
b¯b, γγ, W W ∗.

In ref. [11] it was shown that, while NNLO corrections to the inclusive HW cross section
are tiny, of the order of 1-2%, the impact of NNLO corrections can increase substantially at
the LHC when cuts are imposed on the decay products or when jet-veto criteria are applied.
Since a jet-veto can have a large impact on the size of higher-order corrections, it should be
modelled as accurately as possible. In an NNLO calculation, however, a jet is made up of
only one or two partons, and no large all-order logarithms are accounted for. Although in
this particular case large logarithms can be resummed quite precisely (for instance using the
approaches of refs. [17] or [18]), it is often very useful, and at times needed, to model such
eﬀects by means of a fully-diﬀerential simulation, where large logarithms are resummed
(although with limited logarithmic accuracy) by a parton shower algorithm. The precision
required for LHC studies also demands that at least the NLO corrections be included in
such event generation tools, providing therefore predictions where NLO eﬀects are matched
to parton showers (NLOPS). Thanks to the various implementations of the MC@NLO [19] and
POWHEG [20] algorithms such tools are now routinely used by experimentalists and theorists.
More speciﬁcally, the QCD NLO calculation of associated Higgs production (HV) was
matched to parton showers with the MC@NLO method [21], and, more recently, also using
POWHEG [22]. Ref. [22] also contains NLOPS results for HV + 1 jet, and a merging of the HV
and HV+jet NLOPS simulations, obtained with the so-called “Multiscale improved NLO”
approach (MiNLO in the following).1 The MiNLO approach was formulated in ref. [24] and
subsequently reﬁned in ref. [25]. In the latter work it was shown that for processes where
a colorless system X is produced in a hadronic collision, one can simulate with NLOPS
accuracy both X and X +1 jet production simultaneously, without introducing any external
merging scale. In refs. [25, 26] it was then shown that with a merged generator of X and
X + 1 jet, and the NNLO computation for X production, one can build an NNLO+parton
shower accurate generator (NNLOPS from now on) for X production. This approach was
used to build NNLOPS accurate generators for Higgs via gluon fusion [26] and Drell Yan
production [27]. Recently, the MiNLO method was extended further [28] so that the one can
merge even three units of multiplicity while preserving NLO accuracy. The construction of
these NNLOPS generators based on MiNLO relies on a reweighting which is diﬀerential in the
variables describing the inclusive X-production Born phase space. For Higgs production
this amounts to a one-dimensional reweighting in the Higgs rapidity, while for Drell Yan

zero and one-jet regions [23].

production a three-dimensional reweighting has been used.

In this paper, we use the aforementioned MiNLO-based approach to match the results
obtained in ref. [22] for HW + 1 jet production, to the exact NNLO QCD computation
of HW presented in ref. [11], thereby obtaining the ﬁrst NNLOPS accurate results for HW
production, including leptonic decays of the W boson. Since the Born phase-space for H(cid:96)ν
production involves six variables, one would need to carry out a six-dimensional reweighting,
which is currently numerically unfeasible. We will describe in the core of the paper how we
deal with this problem.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. 2 we outline our method, and discuss in
particular the treatment of the multi-dimensional Born phase space. In Sec. 3 we give all
details about our practical implementation. In Sec. 4 we validate our results, while in Sec. 5
we present phenomenological results with cuts suggested for the writeup of the fourth Higgs
Cross Section working group report. We conclude in Sec. 6. In App. A we give few more
details about the scale variation uncertainties of the results.

2 Outline of the method

The method we use in this work is based on achieving NNLOPS accuracy by reweighting
Les Houches events produced by the MiNLO-improved POWHEG HW plus one jet generator
(HWJ-MiNLO). Each event, with a given weight, contains a ﬁnal state made of the colorless
system (the Higgs boson and the lepton pair from the W boson) and 1 or 2 additional
light QCD partons. NNLOPS accuracy is obtained by an appropriate rescaling of the original
weight associated to each event. As described in detail in refs. [26, 27], the rescaling
must be diﬀerential in the variables describing the Born kinematics of the colorless system.
Concretely, for each event one computes the Born variables using the kinematics of the
colourless partons in the event kinematics, as is. Using these observables, a rescaling factor
for each weight is computed. In its simplest form, the rescaling factor can be written as

W(ΦB) =

dσNNLO

dσMiNLO

where dσNNLO

( dσMiNLO

) is a multi-diﬀerential distribution obtained at pure NNLO level (using

It is clear that, by construction, Born variables will be described with NNLO accuracy.
Furthermore, since the HWJ-MiNLO is NLO accurate for distributions inclusive on all radia-
tion, it is straightforward to prove (along the lines of the proofs presented in refs. [26, 27])
that this rescaling does not spoil the NLO accuracy of HWJ-MiNLO generator. As a conse-
quence of these two facts, after rescaling, one obtains full NNLO accuracy for HW.

One might worry that once events undergo a parton shower, the NNLO accuracy might
be lost. It is however easy to see that this is not the case: the second emission is generated
by POWHEG precisely in such a way as to preserve the NLO accuracy of 1-jet observables.
Hence the ﬁrst emission generated by the parton shower is the third one, i.e. the eﬀect of
the parton shower starts at O(α3

s), and is therefore beyond NNLO.

B) plane, pointing away from p(cid:48)

(cid:48), one deﬁnes a z-axis in this frame such that it bisects the angle between p(cid:48)

In the present case, the Born kinematics is fully speciﬁed by six independent variables.
For instance one can choose the rapidity of the HW-system (yHW), the diﬀerence in rapidity
between the Higgs and the W boson (∆yHW), the Higgs transverse momentum (pt,H), the
dilepton pair invariant mass (m(cid:96)ν) and two angular variables. A convenient standard choice
for the angular variables is to use the Collins-Soper angles [29] deﬁned as follows. One
(cid:48)
considers a boost from the laboratory frame to the rest frame of the W boson (the O
frame). Using the positive and negative rapidity beam momenta, respectively p(cid:48)
A and p(cid:48)
A and −p(cid:48)

B.
One then introduces a transverse unit vector ˆqT , orthogonal to the z axis and lying in the
(p(cid:48)
A, p(cid:48)
A + p(cid:48)
B. The Collins-Soper angles are deﬁned as the
(cid:48) with respect to the z-axis ((cid:126)l(cid:48)
polar angle θ∗ of the lepton momentum l(cid:48) in O

and the azimuthal angle φ∗ of l(cid:48) ((cid:126)l(cid:48)
· ˆqT = |l(cid:48)
Since the decay of a massive spin one particle is at most quadratic in the lepton mo-
mentum (cid:126)l(cid:48) in the frame O
(cid:48), one can parametrize the angular dependence in terms of the
nine spherical harmonic functions Ylm(θ∗, φ∗) with l ≤ 2 and |m| ≤ l. This can be under-
stood from the observation that the decay of a massive spin one particle is associated to 9
degrees of freedom (the spin-density matrix is a 3x3 matrix). One of these coeﬃcients is
then ﬁxed by the normalisation of the cross section, so that eight independent coeﬃcients
are suﬃcient to parametrize the angular dependence. As it is done in the case of Drell-Yan,
it is convenient to introduce the following parametrisation for the angular dependence,

Hence, in order to compute both the numerator and denominator in eq. (2.1), as re-
quired for the reweighting, we can use eq. (2.2) with the angular functions deﬁned in eq. (2.3)
and the coeﬃcients computed using eq. (2.4). In summary, by using the Collins-Soper an-
gles one can turn the problem of computing diﬀerential distributions in six variables, into
the determination of nine four-dimensional distributions, i.e. dσ/dΦHW∗ and the eight dis-
tributions Ai(ΦHW∗) of eq. (2.4).

3 Practical implementation

In the previous section we have outlined the method that we will use in the following to
achieve NNLOPS accuracy. Here, we will provide details about the choices that we made in
our practical implementation, we outline the setup that we have adopted to present the
results of this paper, and we give the procedure that we used to estimate the theoretical
uncertainty.

3.1 Procedure
A ﬁrst consideration is that when using multi-diﬀerential distributions one needs to decide
the number of bins in each distribution. Previous experience suggests that having about
25 bins per direction is suﬃcient for practical purposes, hence we will adopt this choice
here. In order to improve the numerical precision, we ﬁnd it useful to use bins that contain
approximately the same cross-section, as opposed to bins that are equally spaced. Prac-
tically, we perform (moderate statistics) warm-up runs at NLO using HWJ-MiNLO. From
the diﬀerential cross sections obtained from these runs, we determine the appropriate bins.
We then read in the bin values when performing high-statistic runs to extract the needed
distributions.

We have simpliﬁed our procedure by noting that the m(cid:96)ν invariant mass distribution
has a ﬂat K-factor. This is true even when examining the dσ/dm(cid:96)ν distribution in diﬀerent
bins of ΦHW = {yHW, ∆yHW, pt,H}. Therefore, in eq. (2.2) we replace ΦHW∗ with ΦHW and in
eq. (2.5) we integrate over m(cid:96)ν, meaning that instead of having four-dimensional distribu-
tions, we use three-dimensional ones. This is an approximation, however we believe that it
works extremely well, as discussed in Sec. 4.

A further point to note is that, as observed already in ref. [26], a reweighting of the
form eq. (2.1) spreads the NNLO/NLO K-factor uniformly, even in regions where the HW

– 5 –

system has a large transverse momentum, i.e. a region that is described equally well by a
pure NNLO HW calculation, or by the HWJ-MiNLO generator. However, it is also possible
to introduce a reweighting that goes smoothly to one in the regions where both generators
have the same accuracy to start with. In order to do this, one introduces a smooth function
of pT , that goes to one at pT = 0 and that vanishes at inﬁnity. For instance, one can
introduce

to split the cross-section into

h(pT ) =

(MH + MW )2

(MH + MW )2 + p 2

T

,

dσA = dσ h(pT ) ,

dσB = dσ (1 − h(pT )) .

One then reweights the HWJ-MiNLO events using

W (ΦHW, pT) = h (pt) ∫ dσNNLO δ (ΦHW − ΦHW (Φ)) − ∫ dσMiNLO

B

∫ dσMiNLO

δ (ΦHW − ΦHW (Φ))

δ (ΦHW − ΦHW (Φ))

+ (1 − h (pt)) .

This reweighting factor preserves the exact value of the NNLO diﬀerential cross-section

(3.4)

We choose pT to be the transverse momentum of the leading jet when clustering events
with the inclusive kT -algorithm with R = 0.4 [30, 31]. The reason for this is choice is that
h(pT ) goes to one when no radiation is present, since the leading jet transverse momentum
vanishes. On the contrary, when hard radiation is present, the transverse momentum of the
leading jet becomes large, h(pT ) goes to zero, and accordingly W(ΦHW, pT ) goes to one.
3.2 Settings
We give here a complete description of the setup used for the results presented in this paper.
The speciﬁc process studied is

pp −→ HW + −→ H(cid:96)+ν(cid:96) ,

(3.5)
where (cid:96)+ = {e+, µ+}.2 We note that we leave the Higgs boson in the ﬁnal state, rather
than decaying it.
We used the code HVNNLO [32] to obtain NNLO predictions, and the HWJ-MiNLO code [22]
implemented in the POWHEG BOX [33] to produce Les Houches events. Throughout this work
we consider 13 TeV LHC collisions and use the MMHT2014nnlo68cl parton distribution
functions [34], corresponding to a value of αs(MZ) = 0.118. We set MW = 80.399 GeV
and ΓW = 2.085 GeV. Furthermore we use αem = 1/132.3489 and sin2 θW = 0.2226.
Finally we use MH = 125 GeV. Jets have been constructed using the anti-kt algorithm with
R = 0.4 [35] as implemented in FastJet [36, 37]. For HWJ-MiNLO events the scale choice is

2When running the code we ﬁxed the W boson decay to the electron channel and multiplied the result

by two to include the muon channel.

dictated by the MiNLO procedure; for the NNLO we have used for the central renormalisation
and factorisation scales µ0 = MH + MW .

To shower partonic events we have used Pythia8 [38] (version 8.185) with the “Monash
2013” [39] tune. To deﬁne leptons from the boson decays we use the Monte Carlo truth,
i.e. we assume that if other leptons are present, the ones coming from the W decay can be
identiﬁed correctly. To obtain the results shown in the following sections, we have switched
on the “doublefsr” option introduced in ref. [40]. The plots shown throughout the paper
have been obtained keeping the veto scale equal to the default POWHEG prescription.

3.3 Estimating uncertainties
We outline here the procedure that we use to estimate the uncertainties in our NNLOPS
event generator. This procedure is similar to the one already used in refs. [26, 27], but we
ﬁnd it useful to recall it here for completeness. As is standard, the uncertainties in the
HWJ-MiNLO generator are obtained by varying by a factor 2 up and down independently all
renormalisation scales appearing in the MiNLO procedure by KR (simultaneously) and the
factorisation scale by KF, keeping 1/2 ≤ KR/KF ≤ 2. This leads to 7 diﬀerent scale choices
given by
(3.6)

(KR, KF) = (0.5, 0.5), (1, 0.5), (0.5, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2) .

The seven scale variation combinations have been obtained by using the reweighting feature
of the POWHEG BOX.

For the pure NNLO results the uncertainty band is the envelope of the same 7-scale
variations as used for HWJ-MiNLO uncertainties. Currently, in the next-to-next-to-leading
order computation in HVNNLO, the only way of doing scale variations is to re-run the entire
program with new scales. To be more eﬃcient, one can instead compute the NNLO result
at just 3 scale choices for µF , e.g. (KR, KF) = (1, 0.5), (1, 1), (1, 2), along with pure LO
and NLO results. One can then use renormalisation group equations to predict results at
diﬀerent renomalization scales.

For the NNLOPS results, we have ﬁrst generated a single HWJ-MiNLO event ﬁle with all
A/B /dΦB entering eq. (3.3) for all 7 scale

the weights needed to compute the integrals dσMINLO
choices.
The diﬀerential cross-section dσNNLO/dΦ was tabulated for each of the seven scale
variation points corresponding to 1/2 ≤ K(cid:48)
F ≤ 2. The analysis is then performed by
processing the MiNLO event for given values of (KR, KF), and multiplying its weight with
the factor

The central value is obtained by setting (KR, KF) = (K(cid:48)

3We have checked that performing instead a 21-point variation, i.e. doing only a 3-point scale variation
in the NNLO result, leads in general to only moderately smaller uncertainties, as discussed in Appendix A.

– 7 –

As explained in refs. [26, 27], the motivation to vary scales in the NNLO and HWJ-MiNLO
results independently is that, in the same spirit of the eﬃciency method [41], we regard
uncertainties in the overall normalisation of distributions as being independent of the re-
spective uncertainties in the shapes.

4 Validation

4.1 Validation of the NNLOPS method
Our method uses the approximation that the K-factor of the dilepton system invariant
mass is ﬂat in the whole phase space. Hence, we ﬁrst discuss how good this approximation
is.

Figure 1 (left) shows the distribution of the (l, ν)-invariant mass m(cid:96)ν integrated over

which is constructed in order to ﬂatten the m(cid:96)ν distribution. The upper panels show the pre-
dictions from HWJ-MiNLO(LHE) at pure Les Houches event (LHE) level, i.e. including NLO
and Sudakov eﬀects, but prior to parton shower (blue), predictions at HW-NNLOPS(LHE) level,
i.e. including NNLO corrections and Sudakov eﬀects but no parton shower (red) and NNLO
results (green). The lower panels show the ratio to the NNLO result. The uncertainty bands
are computed as described in Sec. 3.3. We notice that NNLO and HW-NNLOPS(LHE) pre-
dictions agree very well within their small uncertainty bands. HWJ-MiNLO(LHE) predictions
are about 5% lower, but, as expected, the NNLO/NLO K-factor is ﬂat over the whole re-
gion. In fact, the distributions have a Breit-Wigner shape, hence one expects higher-order
corrections to aﬀect the shape only very mildly, if at all.

Since our reweighting procedure is diﬀerential in all Born variables, but for m(cid:96)ν, we
need to also verity that the NNLO/NLO K-factor is ﬂat in bins of all other Born variables.

ﬁve red lines show the same K-factor in a ﬁxed a(cid:96)ν bin.4 Now, the grey band corresponds to
the statistical uncertainty of the K-factor integrated over the whole alν range, multiplied by
a factor 5. Since we are probing 25 bins in a(cid:96)ν, one expects that the statistical uncertainty
for a particular bin is bigger by √Nbins (we recall that the a(cid:96)ν distribution is by construction
fairly ﬂat). Therefore this band provides an estimate of the uncertainty of the K-factor on
each a(cid:96)ν bin. We see that, within statistical ﬂuctuations, the red lines lie within the grey
band. This shows that, within the statistical uncertainties, the K-factor is independent of
the value of a(cid:96)ν.

For further validation we should check whether the distributions of the Born variables
ΦHW obtained with HW-NNLOPS(LHE) reproduce the results from the HVNNLO code. In Fig. 3
we can see rebinned distributions that we have used for reweighting (left) and unrebinned
distributions (right) of the rapidity of the HW system yHW, the transverse momentum of
Higgs boson pt,H and the rapidity diﬀerence between Higgs and W-boson ∆yHW. We see
that in the rebinned distributions we ﬁnd perfect agreement between HW-NNLOPS(LHE) and
NNLO results. For the unrebinned distributions we see that, when rebinned bins are large,
e.g.
for pt,H > 270 GeV or yHW > 2.8, minor artifacts are present. These can be always
reduced using a suitable, ﬁner binning for the 3D-histograms used for the reweighting.

As expected, the HW-NNLOPS(LHE) results reproduce very well results from HVNNLO and
the uncertainty band of HWJ-MiNLO(LHE) shrinks from around ±10% to about ±2% in the
HW-NNLOPS(LHE) case, which is a result of including NNLO corrections.

4.2 Validation of the use of Collins-Soper angles

As discussed in the previous section the Collins-Soper (CS) frame is a natural choice for
the description of spin one vector boson decay. This frame is convenient since it allows
the angular dependence of the vector decay to be parametrized in terms of only eight
coeﬃcients. Here we want to verify how well the CS parametrization works in practice.

In the case of θ∗ distributions the only terms in Eq. (2.2) that contribute are A0 and
A4, since the other terms drop out when integrating over φ∗. The φ∗ distributions on the
other hand depend only on A2, A3, A5 and A7.

In the upper left panel of Fig. 4 we show the dependence of the coeﬃcient A4 on yHW,
whereas in the upper right plot we present the θ∗ distribution integrated over the whole
range of pt,H, ∆yHW and, as an example, in the range of yHW marked on the left upper
plot by a yellow band. The red and green bands denote the theoretical uncertainty, as
described before. The orange line shows the prediction from Eq. (2.2) with the coeﬃcients
computed for the central scale choice from Eq. (2.4) at pure NNLO level. Notice that the
θ∗ distribution is not symmetric since we have restricted ourselves to yHW values where A4
is always positive, hence the functional dependence encoded in f4(θ∗, φ∗) is visible. From
the r.h.s. plot we can see that the central NNLO result is fully compatible with f (θ∗), i.e.
the prediction from Eq. (2.2). Furthermore, we see that the NNLO prediction is consistent

5 Phenomenological results

We will now discuss a few phenomenological results obtained with our new code. We remind
the reader that the speciﬁc process studied here is pp → H(cid:96)+ν(cid:96), with (cid:96)+ = {e+, µ+} and
that we do not consider decays of the Higgs boson.
For all the results presented in this section we apply the cuts that were suggested in the
context of the Higgs Cross Section Working Group (HXSWG) activity for the preparation
of the fourth Yellow Report. We consider 13 TeV LHC collisions. We require one positively

energy cut. When applying a jet-cut or a jet-veto we deﬁne a jet as having pt,j > 20 GeV
and |yj| < 4.5. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm [35] with R = 0.4, as
implemented in Fastjet [37]. At the moment we do not apply any cuts on the Higgs boson,
however our code produces Les Houches events, which can be interfaced with any tool that
provides the decay of the Higgs in the narrow width approximation. For example, this can
be obtained easily by allowing Pythia8 to treat the Higgs boson as an unstable object.

5.1 Fiducial cross-section
The ﬁducial cross section at √s = 13 TeV, together with its theoretical uncertainty, at
diﬀerent levels of the simulation, is given in table 1. From these results we obtain a K-
factor between HVNNLOPS and HWJ-MiNLO equal to 1.05. We also see that the reweighting

procedure of HWJ-MiNLO events to NNLOPS accuracy gives, by construction, the same result
as the ﬁxed order NNLO calculation. As expected the scale uncertainties for the HVNNLOPS
and HVNNLO results are compatible within the numerical accuracy, providing a reduction of
almost one order of magnitude as compared to the HWJ-MiNLO result.

5.2 Higgs and Leptonic Observables
In the following we consider cross-sections obtained at various levels: at Les Houches event
level before shower at NLO or NNLO accuracy, HWJ-MiNLO(LHE) and HW-NNLOPS(LHE), re-
spectively; after showering the HWJ-MiNLO(LHE) and HW-NNLOPS(LHE) events with Pythia8,
HWJ-MiNLO(Pythia8) and HW-NNLOPS(Pythia8), both with and without hadronization.

We start by showing in Fig. 5 the distributions for the transverse momenta of the
W boson and the HW system, respectively. NNLO results are compared against those
obtained with HWJ-MiNLO and HVNNLOPS. For observables that are fully inclusive over QCD
radiation, such as pt,W, the agreement among the HVNNLO and NNLOPS predictions is perfect,
as expected. As in the case of the ﬁducial cross-section one notices the sizable reduction of
the uncertainty band from around 8% in HWJ-MiNLO to about 1% in the case of HVNNLO and
HVNNLOPS. As no particularly tight cuts are imposed, the NNLO/NLO K-factor is almost
exactly ﬂat.

The right panel shows instead the eﬀects due to the Sudakov resummation. At small
transverse momenta, the NNLO cross section becomes larger and larger due to the sin-
gular behaviour of the matrix elements for HW production in association with arbitrarily
soft-collinear emissions. The MiNLO method resums the logarithms associated to these
emissions, thereby producing the typical Sudakov peak, which for this process is located at
2 GeV (cid:46) pt,HW (cid:46) 5 GeV, as expected from the fact that the LO process is Drell-Yan like.
It is also interesting to notice here two other features that occur away from the collinear

singularity, and which are useful to understand the plots which are shown later. Firstly,
the pt-dependence of the NNLO reweighting can be explicitly seen in the bottom panel,
where one can also appreciate that at very large values not only the NNLOPS and MiNLO
results approach each other, but also that the uncertainty band of HVNNLOPS becomes pro-
gressively larger (in fact, in this region, the nominal accuracy is NLO). Secondly, in the
region 30 GeV (cid:46) pt,HW (cid:46) 200 GeV, the NNLO and NNLOPS lines show deviations of up to
10 %: these are due to both the compensation that needs to take place in order for the two
results to integrate to the same total cross section, and the fact that the scale choices are
diﬀerent (ﬁxed for the NNLO line, dynamic and set to pt,HW in MiNLO). At pt,HW (cid:39) 200−250
GeV the two predictions agree quite well, since this is the region of phase space where the
MiNLO scale approaches that used at NNLO (µ = MH + MW ). The two lines don’t cross
at pt (cid:39) MH + MW but rather at slightly larger values, because the eﬀects of spreading the
NNLO/NLO K factor non-uniformly in pt are still noticeable, although small, at 200 GeV.
At even higher transverse momenta, pt,HW (cid:38) 400 GeV, the MiNLO Sudakov is not active,
however the MiNLO scale is set to the transverse momentum which is higher than the scale
in the NNLO calculation. As consequence, the NNLOPS results are lower than the NNLO
one.

It is interesting to look at a variable describing the decay of the HW resonance, e.g. the
azimuthal angle between the W + boson and the Higgs particle (∆φHW). At leading order
the two particles are back-to-back, ∆φHW = π, but real radiation moves the bosons away
from this conﬁguration. In Fig. 6 (left) we show the distribution of ∆φHW comparing the
HVNNLO result to the result of our simulation after including parton shower eﬀects, before
and after the NNLO rescaling. For moderate values of ∆φHW ((cid:46) 2.0) we have a very ﬂat
correction, as this region is dominated by events with high transverse momentum of the
HW-system, and dominant eﬀects captured by ﬁxed order NNLO calculation. However, the
limit with nearly back-to-back emission of H and W + corresponds to the low-pt,HW region
which is sensitive to the eﬀects of soft radiation. Hence there are pronounced diﬀerences
in the region ∆φHW (cid:38) 2.5 between the NNLOPS simulation, and the NNLO prediction that

diverges at ∆φHW = π. On the contrary, the distribution of the azimuthal angle between (cid:96)+
and Higgs, shown in the right panel of Fig. 6, has no divergence in the NNLO calculation.
It therefore has a much ﬂatter K-factor throughout the whole range, and the theoretical
uncertainty bands of the HVNNLO and HVNNLOPS simulations overlap.

We next present in Fig. 7 the distributions of the transverse momentum (left) and the
rapidity (right) of the positive lepton (cid:96)+. We can see that there is a clear agreement between

5.3 Jet observables

We present now the study of observables involving ﬁnal state jets. We will focus on the
diﬀerences in distributions coming from NNLO, and HVNNLOPS at both parton and hadron
level. In Fig. 9 we show the transverse momentum of two hardest jets. The distributions

are cut at the minimum transverse momentum used for jets, i.e. 20 GeV, but, from the
ratio plot, one can see that the ﬁxed order NNLO calculation starts increasing sharply as
it approaches a divergence at low-pt. As we identify only jets with pt > 20 GeV we do not
see the Sudakov peak in the HW-NNLOPS simulations, which sits below the cut.

We will ﬁrst discuss diﬀerences between the pure ﬁxed order calculation (green) and
the NNLOPS result before hadronization (blue). At large transverse momenta, theoretical
uncertainties for the ﬁrst jet (Fig. 9, left) are of comparable size in all simulations, even
if they are slightly smaller in the NNLO calculation. We should also note that, as in the
case of pt,HW, the HVNNLO result is larger than the HVNNLOPS one for large-pt values. This

code.

For the second jet transverse momentum distribution (Fig. 9, right), we note that, as
expected, the theoretical uncertainty is larger than in the previous case, as the second jet
is described only with LO accuracy. However we note that the scale variation procedure
now gives smaller bands for the HVNNLOPS simulation, compared to the NNLO calculation.
This is due to the fact [26] that POWHEG produces additional radiation (the second jet in the
case of HWJ-MiNLO) with a procedure that is insensitive to scale variation. The second jet
spectrum is multiplied by the NLO cross section kept diﬀerential only in the underlying Born
variables, i.e. the ¯B function. Scale variation aﬀects only the computation of this function
(which is NLO accurate), hence as a result the uncertainty due to scale variation for the
pt,j2 spectrum is underestimated with respect to a standard ﬁxed-order computation. We
recall that this is a known issue in POWHEG simulations, and was discussed in several previous
publications [33, 42]. In order to get a more reliable uncertainty band, one can split the
real contribution into a singular part (which enters in both the ¯B function and the POWHEG
Sudakov) and a ﬁnite one, corresponding to two resolved emissions. By not including the
latter contribution in the ¯B function and in the POWHEG Sudakov, the estimation of scale
uncertainty would be more similar to what one expects for an observable which is described
at LO, as the second-jet high-pT tail.

Next we ﬁnd it interesting to examine the size of non-perturbative eﬀects. Hadroniza-
tion has a sizable impact on the shapes of jet distributions: diﬀerences up to 7−8 % can be
seen in the pt,j1 spectrum at small values, and are still visible at a few percent level till rela-
tively hard jets are required (pt,j1 > 100 GeV). For the second jet, hadronization corrections
are similar and only slightly more pronounced. Even larger eﬀects can be seen in the rapid-
ity distribution of the two leading jets at large rapidities, as can be seen from Fig. 10. This
is not surprising since the large rapidity region is dominated by small transverse momenta.

We have also studied a few dijet observables.

the two hardest jets (right). We can see that ∆yj1,j2 displays a peak in the bin just above

(green), HW-NNLOPS (blue) and HW-NNLOPS with hadronization (red).

∆y = 0.4 which is consistent with the jet radius (R = 0.4) we used for clustering jets.
A similar peak is present also in the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the jets
∆φj1,j2. We notice that the invariant mass distribution has a peak and a noticeable shoulder
(partially washed away after hadronization) at about 55-60 and 20-35 GeV, respectively.
Their origin can be understood from the peaks in the ∆yj1,j2 and ∆φj1,j2 distributions.
In fact the invariant mass can be written as Mj1j2 = 2pt,j1pt,j2(cosh ∆yj1,j2 − cos ∆φj1,j2).
It is easy to roughly estimate the positions of the structures present in the Mj1j2 plot:
they correspond to when the transverse momenta of the jets are close to the transverse
momentum cut, one of the variables (∆yj1,j2 or ∆φj1,j2) is close to its peak and the other
one is integrated over.

Finally, we examine production rates when binned into six regions according to the
transverse momentum of the Higgs boson (3 bins corresponding to 0 < pt,H < 150 GeV,
150 < pt,H < 250 GeV, and 250 GeV< pt,H) and the presence or absence of an additional
jet (with jet-veto or with one or more jets). In Fig. 12 we show the six cross-sections, after
showering HW-NNLOPS(LHE) with Pythia8 (HW-NNLOPS) with and without hadronization, and
the pure NNLO predictions. We notice that, due to radiation that ends up outside the jet,
jets may be softened during parton shower evolution and hence the jet-veto cross-sections
are larger at HW-NNLOPS at parton level level compared to pure NNLO level. Diﬀerences
can reach up to about 15% in the zero-jet bin when the Higgs boson has large transverse
momentum. This eﬀect is strengthened once hadronization is applied, since hadronization
soften the leading jet spectrum even further. In this case diﬀerences up to 20% can be found
compared to pure NNLO predictions. One reason for these sizable diﬀerences between
NNLO and HW-NNLOPS predictions is that the jet threshold used here is relatively soft
(20 GeV). In this region the NNLO prediction is starting to diverge and the the leading jet
transverse momentum spectrum is particularly sensitive to soft emissions and hadronization
eﬀects, as shown in Fig. 9. Furthermore, increasing the value of the jet radius would limit the

6 Conclusion

In this paper we have used the MiNLO-based merging method to obtain the ﬁrst NNLO
accurate predictions for HW production consistently matched to a parton shower, including
the decay of the W boson to leptons. The method requires a multi-diﬀerential reweighting
of the weight of HWJ-MiNLO events to the NNLO accurate Born distributions. We have
used that the K−factor, within our statistical accuracy, is independent of the mass of the
dilepton system over the whole phase space, hence we have performed the reweighting in the
three Born variables {yHW, ∆yHW, pt,H} and in the two Collins-Soper angles that describe
the decay of the W boson. For the latter variables, we have exploited the fact that the
kinematic dependence can be parametrized in terms of spherical harmonics of degree up to
two.

For our phenomenological results, we have considered a setup suggested recently in the
context of the Higgs cross section working group. We ﬁnd that including NNLO corrections
in the MiNLO simulation reduces scale variation uncertainties from about 10% to about 1-2%.
Compared to a pure NNLO calculation, while the perturbative accuracy is the same, our
tool allows one to perform fully realistic simulations, including the study of non-perturbative
eﬀects and multi-parton interactions.

By construction, for leptonic observables we ﬁnd that the NNLO and NNLOPS simu-
lations agree when no cut on additional radiation is imposed. However, we ﬁnd sizable

This is particu-
larly the case in the region where the Higgs boson is boosted and a jet-veto condition is
imposed.
In this case diﬀerences amount to about 15% at the 13 TeV LHC. This large
eﬀect is due to a migration of events that, before the parton shower, have a soft jet (whose
transverse momentum is just above the veto scale) from the one-jet to the zero-jet cate-
gory. In fact, with our setup, the main eﬀect of the parton shower is to soften the leading
jet, therefore increasing the fraction of events that fall into the zero-jet category. Diﬀer-
ent jet-thresholds and jet-radii leads to quite diﬀerent conclusions. Still, these diﬀerences
are in general outside the scale-variation uncertainties of the NNLO calculation, hence the
NNLOPS accurate prediction becomes important to provide a more realistic uncertainty esti-
mate. The HVNNLOPS generator we have developed will allow to simulate these features in a
fully-exclusive way, retaining at the same time all the virtues of an NNLO computation for
fully inclusive observables, as well as resummation eﬀects, thanks to the interplay among
POWHEG, MiNLO and parton showering.

A Pure NNLO Uncertainties

This section we compare the 49 scale method we used, as detailed in Sec. 3.3, to the 21
scale method used for HNNLOPS [26] and DYNNLOPS [27]. To do this we repeated our analysis
using the 21 scale uncertainty method, with (KR, KF) = (0.5, 0.5), (1, 1), (2, 2) for the ﬁxed
order NNLO results. We ﬁnd that in general both methods result in uncertainty bands
they are very similar, with the 49 scale uncertainty band being only 1-2 permille larger in
some bins.

There are however few cases where having only 21 scales results in noticeably smaller
uncertainty bands than 49 scales. To quantify better the diﬀerences between the two un-
certainties from the two methods, we show in Fig. 13 four observables for which we found
the largest diﬀerences in uncertainties bands.
