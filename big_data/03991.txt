THE CRITICAL ORBIT STRUCTURE OF QUADRATIC

POLYNOMIALS IN Zp

CARA MULLEN

Abstract. We study the forward orbit of the critical point for poly-
nomials of the form fc = z2 + c deﬁned over Zp. Hubbard trees capture
the dynamical behavior for such maps with ﬁnite critical orbit in C. We
suggest a notion of Hubbard trees in the non-Archimedean setting, and
describe the possible structures that arise for polynomials in Zp. As an
example, we take a closer look at the dynamics of fc for c ∈ Z3.

1. Introduction

In one-dimensional complex dynamics, the forward orbit of the critical
points completely determine the dynamical behavior of a polynomial f . If
all such orbits are ﬁnite, the polynomial is called post-critically ﬁnite (PCF),
and it has an associated Hubbard tree which can capture that behavior. In
particular, the Hubbard tree illustrates the orbit type of a critical point α,
the minimal pair (m, n) such that f m+n(α) = f m(α), and the geometry of
these orbits within the Julia set of f . Hubbard trees have been well studied,
and a full classiﬁcation of ﬁnite critical orbit trees is known in this setting.
For more on complex Hubbard trees, see [3], [4], or [12].

The goal of this article is to begin to understand what the analogous ob-
jects are in a non-Archimedean setting. We explore the critical orbits and
corresponding trees for quadratic polynomials of the form fc(z) = z2 + c
deﬁned over Zp. For each c in Zp, the orbit of the unique critical point is
bounded, so c lies in the p-adic analogue of the Mandelbrot set, Mp =
{c ∈ Cp :
the critical orbit of fc(z) = z2 + c is bounded}, which is sim-
ply the closed unit disk. Mp is more than just a simple disk, however; it
has the structure of an inﬁnitely branching tree with many interesting fea-
tures, which lead to striking patterns in the dynamics of these uni-critical
polynomials.

For example, for each prime p > 2, it is known that if 0 has period n
under iteration of the reduced map (cid:93)fc(z) = z2 +˜c, then either 0 is periodic of
exact period n under iteration of f , or it has inﬁnite orbit and is attracted to

an attracting n-cycle. This follows from the work of Jones [6] and Rivera-
Letelier [13], as well as Benedetto, Ingram, Jones and Levy [2]. See the
discussion in Section 4 for details.

A natural extension of this work is to study what happens when 0 is
strictly pre-periodic under iteration of (cid:93)fc(z) = z2 + ˜c. Building on earlier
results from Pezda [11] and Morton-Silverman [9], we prove the following
theorem:
Theorem 1.1. Let p ≥ 3 and consider the critical orbit for fc(z) = z2 + c,
c ∈ Zp. If 0 is strictly pre-periodic with orbit type (m, n) (mod p), m > 0,
then either 0 has orbit type (m, n) over Zp or there exists some k ≥ 1 and
r|(p − 1) in Z such that

(1) 0 has orbit type (m, n) (mod pi) for all i ≤ k, and
(2) 0 has orbit type (m, rn) (mod pj) for all j > k, with r = p if p = 3.
Otherwise, 0 has inﬁnite orbit, with orbit type (m, ni) (mod pi) for all i ≥
1, where ni is the length of the cycle on which 0 lands when its orbit is
calculated (mod pi).

Remark 1.2. For every prime p, there are only ﬁnitely many PCF poly-
nomials of the form z2 + c, with c in Zp, so there is a uniform bound on k
depending only on p. See Section 5 for further comments.

Remark 1.3. In both the periodic and strictly pre-periodic work, the case
of p = 2 is treated separately. A brief discussion of what happens in Z2 is
included in Section 7.

With the p-adic ultrametric, we may visualize Zp as the set of ends of
a rooted tree. Each vertex of the tree is a closed disk with rational radius
of the form p−n, and two vertices are connected by a branch if the disks
have consecutive radii (see Section 2 for details). Just as Hubbard trees are
deﬁned in C, we deﬁne the critical orbit tree for a polynomial f ∈ Zp[z] as
the convex hull of the critical orbit and the induced dynamical action on
this sub-tree of Zp. The critical orbit tree (mod p) is the subset consisting
of the residue classes (mod p) and the induced dynamical system on this
restricted tree. Theorem 1.1 and the previous work done on the periodic
case imply the following about critical orbit trees in Zp:
Theorem 1.4. Let p ≥ 3 and suppose 0 has ﬁnite orbit for fc(z) = z2 + c,
c ∈ Zp.

(1) If 0 is periodic of exact period n, the critical orbit tree coincides with
the critical orbit tree (mod p). It is a ﬁnite tree with a single vertex
of degree n, and fc acts on the n end points by a cyclic permutation.
(2) If 0 is strictly pre-periodic with orbit type (m, n), the critical orbit
tree either coincides exactly with the critical orbit tree (mod p) or it
diﬀers by one instance of branching.

Motivated by results in complex dynamics, this article is the ﬁrst step in
a project to obtain a complete description of all possible critical orbit trees
for parameters c in Zp, p ≥ 2.

The complete list of ﬁnite critical orbit trees for p = 3 is shown in Figure
1. Note that the (2, 3) tree is the same as the (2, 1) tree (mod 3), and then
branches once below (mod 32). We provide the complete list of ﬁnite critical
orbit trees for p = 5 and p = 7 in Section 5.

Figure 1. The 4 distinct ﬁnite critical orbit trees in Z3, with
corresponding critical orbit type labeled below. Note that the
trees are only drawn (mod pk) when the full tree in Zp agrees
with the truncated tree. In this case we say that the orbit is
resolved (mod pk).

We are not only interested in the structure of ﬁnite critical orbit trees in
Zp, however. Using the technique of linearization outlined in [8], it is possible
to determine the structure of inﬁnite critical orbit trees corresponding to
parameters near PCF points in Zp, based on the proximity of the PCF
parameters. In this article we look closely at the dynamics of Z3 parameters
inside M3, near the PCF point c = −2. In Section 6 we prove the following
theorem:
Theorem 1.5. Let p = 3 and consider the map fc(z) = z2 + c for c ∈ Z3.
In D(−2, 1/9), if a parameter c is such that

c ≡ −2 (mod 3k)

but

c (cid:54)≡ −2 (mod 3k+1),

then 0 has orbit type (2, 3i) (mod 3k+i) for i ≥ 1, for the corresponding map
fc(z) = z2 + c.

The structure of this article is as follows. In Section 2 we describe the
setting. In Section 3 we include some technical results that will be used to
prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.4. We prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.4 in Section 4
and include a discussion of existing work. Section 5 contains the complete
list of ﬁnite critical orbit trees for p = 5 and p = 7, and in Section 6 we
prove Theorem 1.5. We conclude the paper with a brief discussion of the
case of p = 2 in Section 7.

2. The Setting

Throughout this article, we exploit the natural tree structure of Zp, which
may be viewed as a subtree of the Berkovich projective line over Cp. Each
point, or vertex, of the Zp tree is a closed disk with rational radius belong-
ing to the valuation group |Z∗
p| = {p−n}, where | · | is a non-Archimedean
absolute value. We denote these points by D(a, r) = {x : |x − a| ≤ r},
or simply by a center, a, if the radius is clear. Two points D(a1, r1) and
D(a2, r2), with r1 > r2, are connected by a line segment, or branch, if they
are such that a2 ≡ a1 (mod r1
−1). Every point D(a, r) other than the root
of the tree has p + 1 edges branching oﬀ of it, one for each of the p elements
of the residue ﬁeld Zp/pZp (cid:39) Fp lying below it, and one connecting it to the
point D(¯a, pr) above it.

Because Zp = {α ∈ Qp : |α| ≤ 1}, we may consider the top of the tree,
the root, as the closed disk of radius 1 centered at 0, known as the Gauss
point in Berkovich space parlance. If one were to follow each branch down
to the bottom of the tree, one would ﬁnd all of the elements of Zp, each at
the end of exactly one branch of the tree. See [14] to compare Figure 2 to
the Berkovich projective line.

We are interested not only in the action of our map fc(z) = z2 + c on
the ends of the tree (Zp), but also on the vertices. By [13] (Proposition 2.4),
this action is well deﬁned. The induced map on the vertices, which is the
reduction map of fc after a change of coordinates, will have positive degree.
We may then study the local dynamics of fc by considering the iterates of
this induced map. See Lemma 3.5 for more details.

The Zp tree has an induced metric deﬁned on the vertices ζ = D(a, r). We
deﬁne the combinatorial distance between 2 points connected by an edge,

Figure 2. The top of the Z3 tree.

ζ1 = D(a1, r1) ⊇ ζ2 = D(a2, r2) by ρ(ζ1, ζ2) = logp(r1) − logp(r2). Recall
that in a non-Archimedean setting, any point in a disk may be considered
as the center, so that D(a2, r1) = D(a1, r1), for example. This notion of
distance may be extended to 2 points not connected by an edge by deﬁning
ζ1∨ ζ2 to be the smallest disk that contains both ζ1 and ζ2. Then ρ(ζ1, ζ2) =
ρ(ζ1, ζ1 ∨ ζ2) + ρ(ζ2, ζ1 ∨ ζ2). This is also known as the path metric on
Berkovich hyperbolic space [1].

Lastly, when we refer to the kth level of the Zp tree, this includes all of
the disks of radius p−k, of which there are pk. The next level would then
be the k + 1st level, the disks of radius p−(k+1) lying directly below those of
radius p−k.

3. Preliminary Results

This section contains the technical machinery necessary for the proofs of
Theorems 1.1 and 1.4, and for a discussion of the previous work done on the
(mod p) periodic case. Some results are adapted from other papers (see [2],
[6], [9], [10], [11], and [13]), and the language may have been modiﬁed slightly
for our purposes. In general, ﬁx a prime p ≥ 3, and consider fc(z) = z2 + c,
for c ∈ Zp. Some of the following will hold for parameters in spaces larger
than Zp, and other results may also apply to p = 2. Any exceptions are
indicated.

This ﬁrst result is included in [6] Corollary 1.5 (see Lemma 3.2 below).
We give an alternate proof here, to highlight the fact that the attracting
cycle is in the same residue class as 0.

Lemma 3.1. If 0 is periodic of exact period n under iteration of fc (mod
p), then there exists an attracting cycle of exact period n for fc over Zp.

c (0) ≡ 0 (mod p), so 0 is a
Proof. Fix fc(z) = z2 + c and suppose that f n
root of g(z) = f n(z) − z (mod p). The derivative is g(cid:48)(z) = (f n)(cid:48)(z) − 1, so

01D(0,1)D(0,13)D(1,13)D(2,13)D(2,19)D(5,19)D(8,19)D(1,19)D(7,19)2D(0,19)0D(3,19)D(6,19)147D(4,19)630258Level1236

C. MULLEN

g(cid:48)(0) = (f n)(cid:48)(0)−1 ≡ p−1 (mod p). Since p−1 will always be nonzero (mod
p), the conditions for Hensel’s lemma are satisﬁed. There exists a unique
w ∈ Zp such that g(w) = 0 and w ≡ 0 (mod p). So f n(w)− w = 0, and thus
w is periodic of period m such that m|n. It remains to show that m = n.
However, for any m < n with m|n, we must have f m(w)− w (cid:54)= 0 since n
is the least positive integer such that f n(0) ≡ 0 (mod p). If f m(w) − w = 0
with w ≡ 0 (mod p), then f m(0) ≡ 0 (mod p), a contradiction. So w is
periodic of exact period n.

Further, w ≡ 0 (mod p) implies that |w|p < 1. Since w|(f n)(cid:48)(w), we have
|(f n)(cid:48)(w)|p < 1. So w is an attracting periodic point, of exact period n. (cid:3)
Calculating the critical orbit of fc (mod p) is equivalent to calculating
the critical orbit of the reduced map ˜fc for c ∈ Zp. Thus, the following result
([6] Corollary 1.5) implies that an attracting cycle exists only for those fc
such that the critical point is periodic (mod p).
Lemma 3.2. (Jones [6]) Let c ∈ D = {α ∈ Cp : |α| ≤ 1}. Then fc
has a unique attracting cycle if 0 is periodic under iteration of ˜fc and no
attracting cycles otherwise. Moreover, if 0 is periodic of primitive period n
under iteration of ˜fc, then the unique attracting cycle of fc has primitive
period n.

Lemma 3.2 together with the following theorem, adopted from Propo-
sition 4.6 of [13], illustrates why the critical cycle length remains ﬁxed at
n when calculated mod higher powers of p, even when the critical orbit is
inﬁnite: because 0, the only critical point of fc, is in the basin of attraction
of the attracting n-cycle.
Theorem 3.3. (Rivera-Letelier [13]) Suppose a map ϕ ∈ Cp(z) has good
reduction. Then if p does not divide deg(ϕ) then the immediate basin of
attraction of any attracting cycle contains a critical point of ϕ.

This brings up the notion of good reduction for a map ϕ : P1(Cp) →
P1(Cp) with coeﬃcients in OCp. The reduced map ˜ϕ is obtained by reducing
each coeﬃcient modulo the maximal ideal of OCp, p = {α ∈ Cp : |α| < 1}.
We then say that ϕ has good reduction if deg(ϕ) = deg( ˜ϕ). For more details,
see ([14] §2.3). Note that if fc is deﬁned over Zp then it has good reduction
at all primes p.

Lastly, by ([2] Theorem 1.5), we see that the critical point is either in
the attracting cycle, or it has inﬁnite orbit and is attracted to the cycle.
The critical point will not eventually land on the attracting cycle.

Theorem 3.4. (Benedetto, Ingram, Jones, and Levy [2]) Let K be
an algebraically closed ﬁeld which is complete with respect to a non-trivial
non-Archimedean absolute value | · |. Let p ≥ 0 be the residue characteristic
of K, and suppose either that p = 0 or that ϕ ∈ K(z) has degree d < p. If
γ is an n-periodic point of ϕ with

0 < |(ϕn)(cid:48)(γ)| < 1,

then there is a critical point of ϕ with inﬁnite orbit that is attracted to the
cycle containing γ.

Thus ends the machinery necessary to prove Proposition 4.1 in the next
section, for periodic critical points (mod p). For strictly pre-periodic critical
points, we have the following:

Lemma 3.5. If 0 is strictly pre-periodic under iteration of fc (mod p), then
the iterates of fc behave locally as linear aﬃne transformations, and fc is a
local isometry.

Proof. Deﬁne g to be the reduction of an iterate of fc after a change of
coordinates, so that g ﬁxes some point v in the orbit of 0. We choose v to
be the start of the periodic cycle, f m(0), when the critical orbit is calculated
(mod pk). If v has reduced cycle length n, then g is the reduction of f n.
Under the change of coordinates,

g(z) =

1

pk (f n(v + pk · z) − v)

(mod p).

Because f has good reduction, the local map g will be of degree at most
2. We may rule out the possibility of deg(g) = 2, however, since we have
chosen a vertex away from the critical point. By ([13] Proposition 2.4) we
know it has positive degree, so deg(g) = 1. Thus, g(z) = az + b for some
a, b ∈ Fp.

Further, we can show that fc is a local isometry on vertices away from
the critical point. The distance between two points is preserved: Choose
∞(cid:88)
α1, α2 ∈ Zp such that |αi| = 1 for i = 0, 1. Suppose |α2 − α1| = p−r, so
without loss of generality we may write α2 = α1 + a · pr +
aipr+i, with
a ∈ F∗

2 + c − (α2

The next proposition demonstrates that when 0 is strictly pre-periodic
of orbit type (m, n) (mod p), the tail length remains ﬁxed at m when the

(cid:3)

8

C. MULLEN

orbit is calculated modulo higher powers of p, even if the orbit is inﬁnite
over Zp.

Proposition 3.6. Suppose that 0 has strictly pre-periodic orbit type (m, n)
(mod p) for fc, with c in a ﬁnite extension of Qp. Then 0 will have orbit
type (m, nk) (mod pk) for all k ≥ 1, where nk is the length of the cycle that
0 lands on when its orbit is calculated (mod pk).

Proof. First note that the tail length m cannot shrink as the orbit type of
0 is calculated modulo higher powers of p, and so we need only to consider
the possibility of the tail length growing. We will show that the mth iterate
of 0 is periodic at every level, by induction on the power of p.

Consider the disk of radius 1/p around f m(0). Let ζ = D(f m(0), 1/p),

and observe that the nth iterate of f ﬁxes the entire disk ζ: Because f n(f m(0)) =
f m(0), and f preserves the radius of the disk (see the proof of Lemma 3.5
above), we have f n : ζ −→ ζ.

In local coordinates, f n

ζ is a linear map (see Lemma 3.5), so, in particular,
it is a bijection on its residue classes. Thus, the ζ-class of f m(0) is periodic
(mod p), and so f m(0) is periodic (mod p2).

iterate of f ﬁxes ζk. By Lemma 3.5, f nk

Now assume that f m(0) is periodic of period nk (mod pk), to show that
it is periodic (mod pk+1): Let ζk = D(f m(0), 1/pk), and again observe that
the nth
ζ will be a linear map in
k
local coordinates, so it is a bijection on the residue classes below ζk. Thus,
the ζk-class of f m(0) is periodic (mod pk), and so f m(0) is periodic (mod
(cid:3)
pk+1).

The following is an adaptation of Theorem 2 from [11], which will be
used in calculating the examples in Section 5. It explains why we see only
particular ﬁnite critical orbit types for given primes: it is not possible to
construct a polynomial with critical orbit type (m, n) for all positive integers
m, n, when working in Zp. There are certain restrictions on the cycle length,
n, in addition to the restriction that m < p.

In order to state the theorem it is necessary to describe what is referred
to as a (∗)-cycle in [11]. If x0, x1, . . . , xk−1 is a k-cycle in Zp, we say that it
is a (∗)-cycle if |xi − xj| < 1 for all i (cid:54)= j. This equates to the cycle reducing
to a single point (mod p).
Theorem 3.7. (Pezda [11]) A (∗)-cycle of length n exists in Zp if and
only if n is a divisor of p− 1 except for p = 2, 3, in which case n can be any
integer not exceeding p.

THE CRITICAL ORBIT STRUCTURE OF QUADRATIC POLYNOMIALS IN Zp

Proof. This is the culmination of preliminary results from [11], which are
listed below.

• ([11] Lemma 6): If m is the length of a (∗)-cycle in Zp and p (cid:45) m,

• ([11] page 15 Proposition): If there is a (∗)-cycle of length pα, then

then m|(p − 1).

α ≤ 1.

• ([11] Lemma 9):

(p − 2)d ≤ 1.

(1) If x0, x1, . . . , xp−1 is a (∗)-cycle in Zp and |x1 − x0| = p−d then

(2) If p > 3 then there are no (∗)-cycles of length p in Zp. In Z3 there
are no (∗)-cycles of length 9 and in Z2 there are no (∗)-cycles
of length 4.

• ([11] Lemma 10): There are no (∗)-cycles of length 6 in Z3.

Then since any (∗)-cycle of composite length k = ab for a map f corresponds
to a (∗)-cycle of length a for f b, or a (∗)-cycle of length b for f a, we get the
(cid:3)
statement of the theorem.

One consequence of Pezda’s work is the following corollary, which ex-
plains why there are indeed a very restricted number of possible ﬁnite crit-
ical orbit types that arise in Zp.
Corollary 3.8. Let p ≥ 3 and consider the critical orbit for fc(z) = z2 + c,
c ∈ Zp. Suppose 0 has orbit type (m, n) (mod p), m ≥ 1. Then the cycle
length can multiply by r|(p − 1) at most once (r may equal p if p = 3), so
that 0 has ﬁnite orbit type (m, rn). If the cycle length multiplies again, 0
has inﬁnite orbit.

Proof. If 0 has ﬁnite orbit that is not resolved (mod p), it will be resolved
when the orbit is calculated (mod pi) for some i ≥ 2. In this case each of
the n members of the (mod p) cycle has a (∗)-cycle underneath it, when
visualized in the Zp tree. Let the length of each (∗)-cycle be r, with r|p − 1
(or r = 3 if p = 3) by Theorem 3.7. The total length of the cycle will then
be rn, and by ([11] Lemma 3) that is the maximum ﬁnite length allowed.
The length of any cycle in Zp is k = ab, where a is the length of a (∗)-cycle
and b ≤ p. If the length of the critical orbit cycle multiplies again when
calculated (mod pj), j > i, then the critical orbit must be inﬁnite in Zp. (cid:3)

Lastly, it is important to mention the following theorem of Morton and
Silverman, which ﬁrst appeared in [9] (Theorem 1.1), although the proof

10

C. MULLEN

is largely based on their work in [10]. It provides some insight into under-
standing Corollary 3.8, and shows that we not only have this phenomenon
in Zp, but also in ﬁnite extensions of Qp.
Theorem 3.9. (Morton and Silverman [9]) Let K/Qp be a p-adic ﬁeld
with maximal ideal p, let ϕ : P1 → P1 be a rational map of degree at least
two deﬁned over K and with good reduction at p, and let P ∈ P1(K) be a
periodic point for ϕ of minimal period n. Deﬁne integers m and r by

m = ˜ϕ-period of ˜P in P1(Fp),
r = multiplicative period of ( ˜ϕm)(cid:48)( ˜P ) in F∗
p.

(If ( ˜ϕm)(cid:48)( ˜P ) = 0, we set r = ∞.) Then either

n = m, n = mr, or n = mrpe

for some e ≥ 1.

4. The Structure of the Critical Orbit Calculated (mod pi)

We begin this section with a discussion of the known case of when 0 is

periodic (mod p) for fc.
Proposition 4.1. Let p ≥ 3 and consider the critical orbit for fc(z) = z2+c,
c ∈ Zp. If 0 has orbit type (0, n) (mod p), then either 0 is periodic of exact
period n or 0 has inﬁnite orbit, with orbit type (mi, n) (mod pi) for all i ≥ 1.
Proof. Proposition 4.1 follows directly from the results given in Section 3.
Since 0 is periodic (mod p), there is an attracting cycle of period n for fc
by Lemma 3.1. In fact, from the proof of this lemma, it is evident that the
attracting point is in the same residue class as 0. Similarly, the other n − 1
elements of the attracting cycle are in the same classes as the elements of
the reduced critical orbit (mod p), for n > 1.

This is the only attracting cycle for fc, of any cycle length, by Corollary
3.2. By Theorem 3.3, 0 is in the basin of attraction of that attracting cycle,
since it is the only critical point for fc. And lastly, if 0 is not actually
periodic over Zp, it will remain strictly attracted to the attracting cycle
and never eventually join it, by Theorem 3.4. So if 0 does not have exact
period n, it will have inﬁnite orbit, but at every level of the Zp tree, 0 will
be pre-periodic with orbit type (mi, n). The critical point will always land
on exactly one representative of the residue class for each of the n elements
in the attracting cycle, and remain in that cycle once it gets there, but it
will take longer and longer to reach the cycle as the tail length grows when
(cid:3)
the orbit is calculated modulo higher powers of p.
Now we consider the case of when 0 is strictly pre-periodic (mod p) for

fc.

THE CRITICAL ORBIT STRUCTURE OF QUADRATIC POLYNOMIALS IN Zp 11
Theorem 1.1. Let p ≥ 3 and consider the critical orbit for fc(z) = z2 + c,
c ∈ Zp. If 0 is strictly pre-periodic with orbit type (m, n) (mod p), m > 0,
then either 0 has orbit type (m, n) over Zp or there exists some k ≥ 1 and
r|(p − 1) in Z such that

(1) 0 has orbit type (m, n) (mod pi) for all i ≤ k, and
(2) 0 has orbit type (m, rn) (mod pj) for all j > k , with r = p if p = 3.
Otherwise, 0 has inﬁnite orbit, with orbit type (m, ni) (mod pi) for all i ≥
1, where ni is the length of the cycle on which 0 lands when its orbit is
calculated (mod pi).

Proof. Theorem 1.1 also follows directly from the results in Section 3. Since
0 is pre-periodic (mod p), it will have orbit type (m, ni) (mod pi) for all i ≥ 1
by Proposition 3.6. The tail length will be ﬁxed at m when the critical orbit
is calculated modulo higher powers of p, even if the orbit is inﬁnite.

If the critical orbit is ﬁnite, by Corollary 3.8 the (mod p) cycle length
may multiply by some number at most once. That number r must divide
(p − 1) because the resulting cycle lying below each element of the original
(mod p) cycle will be a (∗)-cycle, unless p = 3, in which case r may be 3. If
the cycle length does multiply by r, there will be some maximal power of
p, say pk, such that the critical orbit type is (m, n) (mod pk) and (m, rn)
(mod pk+1). The cycle length will not increase again, so the critical orbit
type will be (m, rn) (mod pk+i) for all i ≥ 1, and in Zp.

These are the only possibilities for strictly pre-periodic critical portraits.
When calculated in Zp, the critical orbit type will be (m, 1), (m, n) with
n < p, or (m, rn). If p = 3, we may have r = p = 3, by Theorem 3.7;
otherwise, r|(p − 1).

We are now ready to explore the implications of Proposition 4.1 and

Theorem 1.1 on the tree structures of ﬁnite critical orbits in Zp.
Theorem 1.4. Let p ≥ 3 and suppose 0 has ﬁnite orbit for fc(z) = z2 + c,
c ∈ Zp.

(1) If 0 is periodic of exact period n, the critical orbit tree coincides with
the critical orbit tree (mod p). It is a ﬁnite tree with a single vertex
of degree n, and fc acts on the n end points by a cyclic permutation.
(2) If 0 is strictly pre-periodic with orbit type (m, n), the critical orbit
tree either coincides exactly with the critical orbit tree (mod p) or it
diﬀers by one instance of branching.

Proof. 1. By Proposition 4.1, if the orbit of 0 is periodic of exact period
n, it will be periodic of exact period n (mod p). In particular, each of the
n elements of the cycle belongs to a distinct residue class (mod p), and
so the structure of the critical orbit tree (mod p) will be exactly the same
structure as the tree in Zp. Further, the critical orbit tree will be a subtree
of the top of the Zp tree, which consists of a vertex (the Gauss point) of
degree p. (See Figure 2, through the ﬁrst level.) The critical orbit sub-tree
will simply be the Gauss point with degree n (≤ p). And since the end
points of the sub-tree are all of exact period n, the iterates of f will act as
cyclic permutations, with f n(z) as the identity.

2. By Theorem 1.1, if 0 is strictly pre-periodic with orbit type (m, n),
it will be strictly pre-periodic with orbit type (m, n1) (mod p), and either
n1 = n or rn1 = n. If n1 = n, then the critical orbit tree (mod p) is
exactly the critical orbit tree in Zp, where each of the m elements in the tail
corresponds to a distinct residue class (mod p), and each of the n elements
in the cycle corresponds to a diﬀerent distinct residue class (mod p). If
rn1 = n, then there are r members of the cycle in each of the n1 residue
classes (mod p), so that each of the n1 vertices (mod p) branches once, into
r distinct disks. All rn1 = n disks are in the same level in the tree. In this
case, the critical orbit tree (mod p) coincides with the tree in Zp except for
one instance of branching at the k + 1st level, as in Theorem 1.1. The ﬁnite
tree will have m + n1 original branches from the top of the tree, so that the
Gauss point has degree m + n1, and if n1 (cid:54)= n then each of the n1 vertices
in the periodic cycle will split into r branches. For example, compare the
(cid:3)
(2, 1) and (2, 3) trees in Figure 1.

For a more explicit illustration of Theorem 1.4, please see the examples

of ﬁnite critical orbit trees in the next section.

5. The Zp PCF Points and Critical Orbit Trees for p = 3, 5, 7

Given Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 4.1, it is relatively straightforward
to calculate all possible PCF orbit types for a given prime, p. We begin by
calculating the p distinct critical orbits for fc (mod p), with parameters in
the p residue classes (mod p). Only the strictly pre-periodic (mod p) critical
orbits need further work; the periodic critical orbits (mod p) indicate the
existence of a hyperbolic component in the parameter space, which contains
only the single isolated PCF parameter in the open disk of radius 1 in Zp.
(See the discussion in §1 of [6] regarding the size of hyperbolic components.)
The pre-periodic orbits are restricted in cycle length (see Theorem 3.7 and

THE CRITICAL ORBIT STRUCTURE OF QUADRATIC POLYNOMIALS IN Zp 13

Corollary 3.8), so once the cycle length has increased beyond the maximum
allowed in Zp, we can be sure that the critical orbit is inﬁnite for that class
of parameters.
Example 5.1. Let p = 3. There are a total of 4 PCF parameters in Z3.

(1) There are 2 hyperbolic components in Z3.

(a) For all Z3 parameters in the disk D(0, 1/3), the critical point
is attracted to an attracting ﬁxed point. When c = 0, 0 is that
attracting ﬁxed point, and for all other parameters 0 has inﬁnite
orbit.
The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 is 0 → 0 (mod 3)

(b) For all Z3 parameters in the disk D(2, 1/3), the critical point
is attracted to an attracting 2-cycle. When c = −1, 0 is in
that attracting cycle, and for all other parameters 0 has inﬁnite
orbit.

The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 + 2 is 0 → 2 → 0 (mod 3)

(2) There exist 2 PCF points outside of the hyperbolic components, in

the disk D(1, 1/3). See Figure 3.
(a) When c = −2, 0 is pre-ﬁxed with orbit type (2, 1). All other
parameters in D(7, 1/9) have inﬁnite critical orbit, with orbit
type (2, 3i) (mod 3k) for k ≥ 1.

The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 − 2 is 0 → 1 → 2 → 2 (mod 3)
(b) There exists another PCF parameter c ∈ D(1, 1/9) with critical
orbit type (2, 3). All other parameters in the disk have inﬁnite
critical orbit, with orbit type (2, 3i) (mod 3k) for k ≥ 2.
The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 + c is 0 → 1 → 2 → 2 (mod 3)
The critical orbit resolves (mod 32), with orbit type (2, 3) :

0 → 1 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 2

Note that there are no PCF parameters in D(4, 1/9). A more thorough
discussion of the behavior around the PCF point c = −2 in D(1, 1/3) follows
in the next section.

After the above calculations are completed for each PCF parameter, we
translate the data to the corresponding critical orbit tree with the help of
Theorem 1.4. If the critical point is of exact period n, the critical orbit tree
will have a single vertex of degree n. If the critical point is strictly periodic
with orbit type (m, n) (mod p), we start with the (mod p) tree, which will

orbit, with critical orbit type (2, 3i) at every level.

have one vertex of degree m + n. This may be the whole tree if the (mod p)
orbit type is the same as the critical orbit type in Zp, such as in the (2, 1)
example above. If not, the tree will have one instance of branching, at the
level above which the Zp critical orbit type is resolved. In the (2, 3) example
the critical orbit is (2, 3) (mod 32), so the (mod 3) tree will branch at the
ﬁrst level. The single vertex in the (mod 3) cycle will have 3 branches below
it.

See Figure 1 for a complete list of the ﬁnite critical orbit trees in Z3.
Example 5.2. Let p = 5. There are a total of 7 PCF parameters in Z5.

(1) There are 3 hyperbolic components in Z5.

(a) For all Z5 parameters in the disk D(0, 1/5), the critical point
is attracted to an attracting ﬁxed point. When c = 0, 0 is that
attracting ﬁxed point, and for all other parameters 0 has inﬁnite
orbit.
The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 is 0 → 0 (mod 5)

(b) For all Z5 parameters in the disk D(4, 1/5), the critical point
is attracted to an attracting 2-cycle. When c = −1, 0 is in
that attracting cycle, and for all other parameters 0 has inﬁnite
orbit.

The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 + 4 is 0 → 4 → 0 (mod 5)

(2) There exist 4 PCF points outside of the hyperbolic components, in

the disks D(2, 1/5) and D(3, 1/5).

orbit type (2, 2) and one c(cid:48) with critical orbit type (2, 8). All
other parameters in the disk have inﬁnite critical orbit, with
orbit type (2, 8 · 5i) (mod 5k) for k ≥ 2.

Example 5.3. Let p = 7. There are a total of 10 PCF parameters in Z7.

(1) There are 3 hyperbolic components in Z7.

(a) For all Z7 parameters in the disk D(0, 1/7), the critical point
is attracted to an attracting ﬁxed point. When c = 0, 0 is that

orbit type (3, 1) and one c(cid:48) with critical orbit type (3, 6). All
other parameters in the disk have inﬁnite critical orbit, with
orbit type (3, 6 · 7i) (mod 7k) for k ≥ 2.

The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 + c and f (z) = z2 + c(cid:48) is 0 → 1 → 2 → 5 → 5 (mod 7)

orbit type (3, 4 · 7i) (mod 7k) for k ≥ 2.

The critical orbit for f (z) = z2 + c and f (z) = z2 + c(cid:48) is 0 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 5 (mod 7)

See Figure 5 for a complete list of the ﬁnite critical orbit trees in Z7.

We may replicate these calculations for any prime p ≥ 3 in order to
deduce exactly which ﬁnite critical orbit types arise for parameters in Zp.
There is a ﬁnite number of ﬁnite critical orbit types that are permissible for
a given prime p, and in fact there is a ﬁnite number of PCF parameters in
Zp.
Proposition 5.4. Fix p ≥ 3 and let Qp be the number of quadratic PCF
parameters in Zp. Then

where the sum is taken over all triples (m, r, n) such that m + n ≤ p and

Proof. For any parameter c ∈ Zp, p ≥ 3, if the critical point has ﬁnite orbit
for the corresponding map fc, then the total length of that orbit is of the
form m + rn, where (m, n) is the (mod p) critical orbit type. Since there
are only p residue classes (mod p), and each of the m + n members of the
(mod p) orbit must be distinct (mod p), m + n ≤ p. By Corollary 3.8, the
cycle length n may multiply at most once by a number r that divides p− 1,
or r = 3 if p = 3, so the cycle length in Zp is rn, where r could be 1.

Any parameter c that corresponds to ﬁnite critical orbit type (m, rn)
will satisfy the equation f m+rn(0) = f m(0). Note that f m+rn(0) − f m(0)
is a degree 2m+rn polynomial in c, and so there are a maximum of 2m+rn
possible distinct PCF parameters in Zp that correspond to each given ﬁnite
critical orbit type (m, rn). If we take the sum of 2m+rn over all possible
triples (m, r, n) given the above restrictions on m, r, and n, then we have a
very crude upper bound on the total possible number of PCF parameters
that live in Zp, for given prime p.
(cid:3)
Remark 5.5. The number of non-zero hyperbolic components in Zp is
bounded above by (p − 1)/2, as the PCF parameter must be a quadratic
residue mod p. Recall from Theorem 4.1 that a hyperbolic component occurs
only when the critical orbit is periodic (mod p). This corresponds to the
existence of a solution to f n
(0) satisﬁes
2 + c = 0, so z2 + c = 0 must have a solution (mod p). Thus −c
fc(z0) = z0
is a perfect square (mod p), so −c is a quadratic residue (mod p), and there
are exactly (p − 1)/2 such values. (See the discussion in [15].)

c (0) = 0 in Zp. The point z0 = f n−1

c

So we see that this bound on Qp may be reﬁned quite a bit, if we even
consider the periodic and strictly pre-periodic PCF parameters separately.
Proposition 5.4 suﬃces to show ﬁniteness, however, and so we will leave it
at that.

Also note that in practice, there are not always (p − 1)/2 hyperbolic
components, as in the case of p = 7. In fact, as Rafe Jones conjectured in
email correspondence, it seems that as p increases to inﬁnity, the proportion
of hyperbolic components tends to 0.

6. The Dynamics of Parameters in Z3 near c = −2

From Example 5.1, we know that there are a total of 4 PCF parame-
ters in Z3. In this section we more closely examine the dynamics of maps
corresponding to parameters in the disk D(−2, 1/9) around the PCF point
c = −2. We give the exact critical orbit type for each parameter, at every
level of the Z3 tree, given how close the parameter is to c = −2.

THE CRITICAL ORBIT STRUCTURE OF QUADRATIC POLYNOMIALS IN Zp 19
Theorem 1.5. Let p = 3 and consider the map fc(z) = z2 + c for c ∈ Z3.
In D(−2, 1/9), if a parameter c is such that

c ≡ −2 (mod 3k)

but

c (cid:54)≡ −2 (mod 3k+1),

then 0 has orbit type (2, 3i) (mod 3k+i) for i ≥ 1, for the corresponding map
fc(z) = z2 + c.

Remark 6.1. We expect a similar statement for parameters in D(1, 1/9)
that are equivalent to the PCF parameter corresponding to critical orbit
type (2, 3) up to a certain level. This will be included in future work.

The remainder of this section is devoted to proving Theorem 1.5. The
proof is calculation-heavy at times, so for ease of reading some of the com-
putations have been omitted. The reader is encouraged to verify any state-
ments that lack full justiﬁcation.
Proof of Theorem 1.5. Consider the PCF parameter c = −2. All other pa-
rameters in D(−2, 1/9) have inﬁnite critical orbit, with orbit type of the
form (2, 3i) at every level in the Z3 tree. The proof is based on the local
structure of the iterates of fc for parameters near c = −2. To begin, we show
that a Z3 parameter 1 combinatorial distance away from the −2-branch in
M3 corresponds to a map with critical orbit type (2, 3).
Lemma 6.2. Suppose c ≡ −2 (mod 3k) but c (cid:54)≡ −2 (mod 3k+1) for k ≥ 2,
c ∈ Z3. Then 0 has orbit type (2, 3) (mod 3k+1).
Proof. For such a c ∈ Z3 in D(−2, 1/9), the corresponding critical orbit is
not ﬁxed as orbit type (2, 1) (mod 3k+1). We show that the ﬁrst iterate of
fc is locally a translation at the kth level. This implies that the length of
the critical orbit cycle will multiply by 3 at the k + 1st level, resulting in
critical orbit type (2, 3) (mod 3k+1).

Consider the local map of fc(z) = z2 + c for c ≡ −2 (mod 3k), c (cid:54)≡ −2
c (0) = c2 + c, which is ﬁxed (mod 3k). Note that

where b ≡ −8l (mod 3) (cid:54)≡ 0 (mod 3) since l ∈ {1, 2}.

(cid:3)

At this point we call upon linearization to complete the picture. For
parameters 1 combinatorial distance away from the −2-branch at the k + 1st
level, fc has critical orbit type (2, 3) (mod 3k+1), for any k ≥ 2. Such fc have
√
1 − 4c)/2 ≡ 2 (mod 3k). We show that a) there
a ﬁxed point x = (1 +
exists a disk of linearization around x in which the iterates of fc behave as
the linear map λz, for λ = (fc)(cid:48)(x); and b) f 2
c (0) is close enough to x that
it is in the linearization disk containing x. We also show that λz is locally
a translation, so the cycle length of vertices in the disk other than x will
increase by a factor of 3 at each level, under iteration of fc.

In terms of existence, any such fc is locally linearizable around its ﬁxed
points by the Non-Archimedean Siegel Theorem of Herman and Yoccoz [5],
since |λ| = 1 and λ is not a root of unity. It remains to show approximately
how big the linearization disks are, using the calculations outlined in [8].
We include relevant deﬁnitions in the proof of Lemma 6.3 below.
Lemma 6.3. The map f−2(z) = z2 − 2 has a disk of linearization of radius
at least 3−3/2 around the ﬁxed point z = 2.
Proof. For z = 2, the multiplier λ2 = 2·2 = 4 satisﬁes 0 < |1−λ| ≤ 1/p, with
|1 − λ2| = |3| = 1/3. We may not use the exact radius of the linearization
disk r(Pλ) given in [8] Theorem 5.1 since 1/p ≮ |1− λ| < 1, so we take ˜r(λ)
to be a suﬃcient lower bound.

ramiﬁed ps-root of unity that minimizes |γ0 − λm|, and t ≥ 0 is the integer
such that R(t) ≤ |γ0 − λm| < R(t + 1).

In our case of λ2 = 4 and p = 3, we have the following: m = 1 and s = 0,

Proof. Using the calculations in the proof of Lemma 6.3 above, we see that
for c ∈ Z3 suﬃciently close to -2, the multiplier of the corresponding ﬁxed
point, x, is close enough to λ2 so that each piece in the deﬁnition of ˜r(λ2)
is the same as for ˜r(λx). Thus, the disk of linearization around x has radius

We now take a closer look at the dynamics of λz in the linearization

disk. The multiplier λ = 2x, so we may write λ = 4 + 2h · πd + 2
biπd+i,
where h (cid:54)= 0 and 3k ≤ πd < 3k+1. We show that the iterates of λz behave
locally as nontrivial translations, away from the ﬁxed point.
Lemma 6.5. Suppose λ ≡ 4 (mod 3k) but λ (cid:54)≡ 4 (mod 3k+1), so λ =
i=1 biπd+i for h ∈ {1, 2}, bi ∈ {0, 1, 2}, 3k ≤ πd < 3k+1.
Then combinatorial distance n away from the 0-branch, the map g(z) = λz
behaves locally as a nontrivial translation, z + 1 or z + 2.

v ≡ 0 (mod 3j) but v (cid:54)≡ 0 (mod 3j+n) for n ∈ N, so v ≡ u · 3j +(cid:80)n−1

a point v that is combinatorial distance n away from the 0-branch. Then

For the base case v is combinatorial distance 1 away from the 0-branch,

so v is ﬁxed at the j + 1st level. We compute the local map:

case for all combinatorial distances away from 0 up to n− 1, so that at each
level the period of v will increase by a factor of 3. Now we will show this
is true for combinatorial distance n away from 0, noting that v will be in a
3n−1-cycle at the j + nth level. We compute the local map:

We now consider the implications of the linearization disk. The dynamics
of fc will match that of λz for all points inside the disk. By Lemma 6.5, the
map λz behaves locally as a non-trivial translation. Translation maps have
local period equal to the residue characteristic of the base ﬁeld, which is 3
in this case. Any vertex ζ = D(a, 3−n) (cid:54)≡ x will be in a 3-cycle (mod 3n+1)
under iteration of λz, so that the total length of the cycle containing ζ will
increase by a factor of 3, for all n. In particular, the total length of the cycle
c (0) calculated (mod 3n+i) will increase by a factor of 3 for
containing ζ = f 2
all i, provided that it is contained in the linearization disk around the ﬁxed
point, x, for fc. We have shown that for c ≡ −2 (mod 3k) but c (cid:54)≡ −2 (mod
c (0) is in the linearization disk around x for k ≥ 2. Therefore the
3k+1), f 2
corresponding critical orbit will be of orbit type (2,1) (mod 3k), (2,3) (mod
3k+1), and in general, (2, 3i) (mod 3k+i), for all i, and any k ≥ 2.

7. Dynamics in Z2

To conclude this article, we brieﬂy examine the case of p = 2. The even
prime is often treated separately, a sort of special case that does not always
follow the same patterns as the odd primes - and this project is no diﬀerent.
Most of the results in this paper hold only for odd primes, and that is at
least partially because some of the technical tools used, such as Hensel’s
lemma, do not apply to fc when p = 2. In lieu of a proof of this fact, we
oﬀer a counterexample and a few straightforward calculations to describe
the parameter space Z2 as we best understand it at this time.

Theorem 7.1. Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 4.1 do not hold for p = 2.

For example, consider the map f (z) = z2 − 2 in Z2. The critical point
is ﬁxed (mod 2), which would typically indicate the presence of a hyper-
bolic component of radius 1, in which every parameter other than c = 0
corresponds to an inﬁnite critical orbit. However, modulo higher powers of
2, the critical orbit eventually resolves itself as type (2,1), which is where it
remains over Z2.

The critical orbit of f (z) = z2 − 2:

0 (cid:9)
(mod 2),
0 → 2 (cid:9)
(mod 22),
0 → 6 → 2 (cid:9)
(mod 23),
0 → 14 → 2 (cid:9) (mod 24),
0 → −2 → 2 (cid:9)
in Z2,

THE CRITICAL ORBIT STRUCTURE OF QUADRATIC POLYNOMIALS IN Zp 25

The ﬁxed point x = 2 in this example is an attracting ﬁxed point, as
opposed to an indiﬀerent ﬁxed point as when c = −2, p ≥ 3. The multiplier
λ = 2x = 4 satisﬁes |λ| = 1/4 < 1. In fact, every cycle which is contained
in the disk {z ∈ C2 : |z| ≤ 1} for fc with c ∈ Z2 is attracting. Further, the
critical point is attracted to exactly one of these attracting cycles for each
fc corresponding to c ∈ Z2.

Thus one fundamental diﬀerence between the p = 2 case and p ≥ 3 is
that the hyperbolic subset of the 2-adic Mandelbrot set is exactly the 2-adic
Mandelbrot set (see the brief discussion in [7]). The radius of each hyperbolic
component is 1, and as Figure 6 suggests, there is only one component
associated to an attracting ﬁxed point and one component associated to an
attracting 2-cycle in Z2.

Figure 6. Z2 as a parameter space, with the critical or-
bit type corresponding to each parameter, calculated at that
level. The 3 paths shaded in gray indicate the known PCF
parameters: c = 0, c = −2 and c = −1. All other branches
seem to correspond to parameters with inﬁnite critical orbit.

Because Proposition 3.6 does not apply in the p = 2 setting, since neither
of the (mod 2) critical orbits are pre-periodic, we cannot be sure that the
3 PCF parameters indicated in Figure 6 are the only ones that live in Z2.
The critical orbit trees associated to these parameters are shown in Figure
7; notice that the tail branches in the (2,1) tree, rather than the cycle. It
would be interesting to investigate whether there is a bound on the number
of times the tail may branch for a ﬁnite critical orbit. This information
would allow us to ﬁnd all of the PCF points in Z2.

This is certainly a topic that is wide open with the potential for future
work. And once all of the possible critical orbit structures are fully under-
stood for quadratic polynomials over Zp, for all primes p ≥ 2, a natural next
step will be to explore the possible structures in ﬁnite extensions of Qp, and
