Deterministic submanifolds and analytic solution of the
stochastic diﬀerential master equation describing a qubit

Alain Sarlette∗ & Pierre Rouchon†

March 18, 2016

Abstract

This paper studies the stochastic diﬀerential equation associated to a quantum sys-
tem subject to Hamiltonian evolution as well as unmonitored and monitored decoherence
channels. The latter imply a stochastic evolution of the quantum state (density opera-
tor), whose associated probability distribution we characterize. We show that for two sets
of typical experimental settings, corresponding either to weak quantum non demolition
measurements or to weak ﬂuorescence measurements, the three Bloch coordinates of a
two-level quantum system (qubit) remain in fact conﬁned to a deterministically evolving
surface or curve inside the Bloch sphere. We explicitly solve the deterministic evolution,
and we provide a closed-form expression for the probability distribution on this surface or
curve. Finally, we relate the existence in general of such deterministically evolving sub-
manifolds to an accessibility question of control theory, which can be answered with an
explicit algebraic criterion on the SDE. This allows us to show that, for a qubit, the above
two sets of weak qubit measurements are essentially the only ones featuring deterministic
surfaces or curves.

Introduction

The quantum master stochastic diﬀerential equation is a general continuous-time model for
Markovian evolution of the density operator ρ (“the state”) of an open quantum system
[1, 2]. Open refers to interactions with an unmonitored environment, and with measurement
devices which provide continuous-time information about the quantum state. For a target
system with Hilbert space H, the eﬀects of these interactions are characterized by operators
Lk on H, sometimes called “Lindblad operators”. Denoting

This is a stochastic diﬀerential equation driven by independent Wiener processes dW k
t to be
understood in the Itˆo sense. The ﬁrst term represents Hamiltonian evolution, with H her-
mitian. The ηk represent measurement eﬃciencies. If all ηk = 1, then the interaction takes
place with perfectly monitored measurement devices, which lose no information about the
current quantum state, and an initially pure sate (ρ of rank 1) remains pure. The associated
noise processes dW k
t model measurement back-action: when a quantum system is measured,
its state moves closer to the stochastic result of the measurement. Completely unmonitored
channels, hence often said to model interactions with “the environment”, would correspond
to ηk = 0. For such channels, ρ can only represent the expected evolution: there is no as-
sociated measurement back-action noise (GLk term), but still a deterministic “relaxation” or
“decoherence” (FLk term).

Our goal is to ﬁnd analytic expressions for the probability distribution of ρt, for all t > 0,
evolving from a known initial state ρ0, when the system follows (2). This is to be understood
as an “a priori” probability distribution, i.e. without/before knowing the values actually taken
by the noise processes dW k

t which reﬂect stochastic measurement results.

The present paper is motivated by recent experimental ﬁndings [3] on an imperfectly
monitored qubit system. The qubit (quantum bit) is the smallest quantum system, with
two-dimensional Hilbert space H = C2.
It has drawn a lot of attention as an illustrative
benchmark of quantum control and as the basic building block for quantum information tech-
nologies [10]. The experimental results of [3] have prompted us to look at (2) as a stochastic
diﬀerential equation with everywhere singular diﬀusion. It is clear that such singular diﬀu-
sion can lead to singular distributions, with lower-dimensional support — but only for speciﬁc
combinations of singular diﬀusion and drift. It turns out that these speciﬁc combinations hold
precisely for typical quantum experiments like the one in [3]. Note that the lower-dimensional
support manifold is in general not constant, but instead it evolves deterministically in time.
This is in the same spirit as the dynamical invariants [7], although instead of requiring the
expectation of a linear operator to be invariant we require a nonlinear manifold to be invari-
ant for any individual realization (with probability 1). Our ﬁrst set of results, see Section
3.1 and Section 4.1, analytically characterize the equation describing the support manifolds
and their deterministic evolution in time, for typical experiments of monitored qubit systems:
homodyne and heterodyne measurement with a hermitian (“quantum non demolition mea-
surement”) or with a nilpotent (“ﬂuorescence measurement”) operator Lk. Furthermore, in
Section 3.2 and Section 4.2, we write the Fokker-Planck Partial Diﬀerential Equation (PDE)
governing the evolution of the probability distribution of ρt on this manifold, and we provide
its closed-form solution. This provides a perfectly precise description of model predictions for
those two particular cases, which in fact has been confronted and conﬁrmed with experimental
data in [3].

The next natural question is how general this conﬁnement to a deterministic manifold
might be for quantum systems. In order to answer this question, we have resorted to a control-
theoretic approach which is recalled in the Appendix and might be of independent interest
for the community; indeed, we have found this method applied to a quantum system only in
very reduced form in [13]. The method considers the independent noise terms as independent
inputs and investigates the support of the distribution through strong accessibility of the
associated control system. The latter can be settled with a Lie algebraic criterion, i.e. a few
explicit computations determine the dimension of the support of the system at any given time,
without having to actually identify the equation of the manifold. We here develop its speciﬁc

2

adaptation to a general quantum master equation of type (2), and we apply it in Section 5 to
establish that for a qubit system, the cases of Section 3 and Section 4 are essentially the only
ones where the qubit distribution remains supported on a submanifold. This points towards
a small class of quantum systems which might be of particular interest for quantum control
purposes.

2 The continuously monitored qubit

The qubit has a two-dimensional Hilbert space H = C2, which is usually identiﬁed with
the span of two orthonormal vectors |gi,|ei ∈ H. The state of an open qubit system is
then represented by the density operator ρ which is a hermitian, positive semideﬁnite matrix
of trace 1. We will use the Pauli operators σx = |eihg| + |gihe|, σy = i(|gihe| − |eihg|),
σz = |eihe| − |gihg|. An alternative representation of the qubit state is with the so-called
Bloch sphere coordinates x, y, z such that ρ = I+xσx+yσy+zσz
. The set of density matrices
then corresponds to all x, y, z for which x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ 1, also known as the Bloch sphere.
model, in the four following typical experimental settings.

In the next sections, we analyze in detail the evolution of the distribution of ρ for a qubit

2

In homodyne detection, (2) features a single monitored coherence channel L1 while in
heterodyne detection it features two channels L1 and L2 = i L1. Physically, this corresponds
respectively to measuring one or the two quadratures of a ﬁeld that has interacted with the
qubit. These two strategies can be applied with L1 a hermitian operator, denoted L1 =
σz without loss of generality, which physically corresponds to a quantum non demolition
measurement; this is the most common type, see e.g. [9, 5]. It can also be applied with L1
nilpotent, denoted L1 = σ− = |gihe| with little loss of generality, which physically corresponds
to a ﬂuorescence measurement; see e.g. [12] for a description of the homodyne case, with
feedback, and [3] for an experiment involving the heterodyne case. Other situations are
possible, see Section 5, but in the ﬁrst part we focus on these experimentally implemented
schemes. This yields in total four cases to be considered:

[HeH]

[HoH]

dρt = 2Fσz (ρt) dt + Gσz (ρt)√η dW 1
dρt = 2Fσ−(ρt) dt + Gσ−(ρt)√η dW 1
dρt = Fσz (ρt) dt + Gσz (ρt)√η dW 1
dρt = Fσ−(ρt) dt + Gσ−(ρt)√η dW 1

Remarkably, for each of these four typical cases, the stochastic evolution of the qubit is
in fact conﬁned to a deterministically evolving submanifold of the state space, as we show
next. We start with the heterodyne cases, where the qubit stays on a deterministically moving
surface. In the homodyne cases, the qubit stays on a deterministically evolving curve. This
reduction in dimension of uncertainty also allows us to provide a closed-form expression for
the probability distribution at any time of the qubit governed by one of (3)-(6).

3 Heterodyne measurement

In Bloch sphere coordinates, both dynamics (3) and (4) are invariant under rotation around
the associated z axis. Physically this just expresses that when measuring both quadratures,
the reference phase for distinguishing the individual quadratures can be chosen arbitrarily. We

therefore rewrite the equations in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) where x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ.
Note that since this is a nonlinear coordinate change it requires to carefully apply Itˆo calculus1.
We get respectively:

are deterministic components of
the respective dynamics. The intersection of the mentioned surfaces with the plane sin θ = 0
are shown on Fig. 1. Theorem 1 can be checked simply by writing the dynamics of bt and ct
respectively using (7), (8) and applying the rules of Itˆo calculus. This yields a deterministic

informative to explain how we have found the appropriate variables. Inspired by experimental
results for (8), we have considered the surfaces deﬁned by r2

to be found, and c ∈ R parametrizes the surfaces. As a ﬁrst condition, we impose that the

described by r2 + bt (1 − z2) = 0, for bt ∈ {1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0} respectively from outer
to inner ellipse; the outermost ellipse (bt = 1) is the unit circle. Right: Curves resulting from

for ct ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1, 2, 10} respectively, from outer to inner ellipse; the outermost ellipse
(ct = 0.5) is the unit circle.

The general solution of this equation is fc(z) = c(1 + z)2 − (1 + z), as appearing in (10). We
have then checked that the associated variable ct follows an autonomous ordinary diﬀerential
equation.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the interpretation of these results.
• For the σ− measurement, ct can only increase. For ct = 1/2 the surface coincides with
the unit sphere and as ct increases the surface shrinks inwards and collapses towards z =
−1 as c → +∞. This reﬂects that when monitoring a qubit via the energy loss channel
σ−, the trajectories always eventually converge towards the ground state. The only
exception to this is when c(0)− η/2 = 0, in which case c(t) = c(0) for all t. Since c(0) ≥
1/2 and η ≤ 1, this only happens for η = 1 and starting on the surface of the Bloch
sphere, in which case we know from information-theoretic arguments that the quantum
state remains pure. However, for η = 1 and non-pure initial state i.e. x2
0 < 1,
maybe surprisingly the purity keeps decreasing. For η = 0.24, the predicted evolution
matches well with experimental results [3]. Note that the deterministic shrinking of
the surface on which the trajectories lie does not preclude that the stochastic evolution
drives a state from the side towards the summit of the surface, hence temporarily
increasing its energy, as has indeed been observed in [3].

0 + z2

0 + y2

• For the σz measurement, the surfaces are ellipsoids whose long axis coincides with the
polar axis and whose short axes, of equal length bt, give the radial extension; thus
bt = 1 characterizes the unit sphere and bt = 0 the polar axis. As expected, bt decreases
exponentially unless η = 1, in which case bt remains constant. Thus unlike for σ−, with
σz even if we do not start on the unit sphere, for η = 1 we stay on the same surface for
all times.

We must conclude by mentioning the points z = ±1 for σz and (resp. z = −1 for σ−)

5

which do not belong to a unique manifold b0 (resp. c0). At these points the coeﬃcients of the
noise vanishes and the noiseless dynamics as well, which means that any initial state on these
points will remain exactly there forever.

3.2 Distribution on the surfaces

In the following we give expressions for the probability distribution of ρt at any time t, when
the system starts from a known initial condition (i.e. a Dirac distribution at some point in
the Bloch sphere) and follows (7) or (8). In the preceding section we have shown that the
distribution is then supported on a deterministically evolving submanifold of the Bloch sphere,
and the following thus handles the remaining degrees of freedom on that submanifold.

For a more general initial state distribution, the expression of the probability distribution
at any time t > 0 is obtained simply by convolution of the results below with the distribution
of initial states.

We recall the following link between SDE and probability distribution, for component ℓ
of a stochastic process in X ∈ Rn evolving subject to independent Wiener processes dW (t)k:

This rule allows us to write the Fokker-Planck equation in convenient coordinates, and in fact
provide a closed-form solution PX (X, t) for all the cases considered in this paper.

Case of σ−: This is in fact the most diﬃcult case, as the evolution of θ depends on zt.
However nothing in the SDE depends on θ and this allows us to solve the system nevertheless.
We start by decomposing the joint probability distribution PX (z, θ) along the Fourier modes
in θ:

[HeN ]

PX(z, θ) =

+∞

where we have only kept the cosines thanks to symmetry (assuming without loss of generality
a solution starting at a known point with θ = 0). Our goal is now to get an expression
for the functions Ak
z = Pz is the marginal probability distribution in z, while the
other terms are not properly speaking probability distributions, as they just characterize its
variation with θ.

It turns out that a particularly simple expression is obtained by characterizing the motion

on the submanifolds by the variable

z → φ =

z + 1 − c(cid:19) =

η(1 + z)2 .

Its geometric interpretation is (η times the square of) the tangent of the angle between the z
axis and the vector passing from z = −1 through the state, see Figure 2. So φ characterizes
the central projection of a state on the Bloch sphere, from the center z = −1 onto the plane

6

at e.g. z = +1. A state close to z = −1 corresponds to φ close to +∞, while a state close to
z = +1 corresponds to φ close to 0. Applying the Itˆo rule, we obtain

dφt = pφt√2 dW z

t +(cid:18)1 + φt +

ηφt

ct + ηφt/2(cid:19) dt .

This must be used in conjunction with the re-expressed longitudinal diﬀusion

dθt = 1/p2φ dW θ

and the formula (11) to get the Fokker-Planck-like equation for each associated Ak

does not look too nice, but with the time-varying change of variables F k

and more towards the point z = −1 (see Figure 2). Also k = 0 becomes dominant for large
t, reﬂecting that the θ variable gets uniformly distributed as well.
In some cases the above series can be worked out more explicitly. For instance we can
z(z, t) when starting at z = +1, which means

compute the marginal distribution Pz(z, t) = A0
n = 1 for all n and using the propertyP+∞n=0 dn+1Ln(x) =

Thus for an experiment starting at any known initial state on the Bloch sphere, at any time
the associated probability distribution is the product of the marginal distribution in z and
the marginal distribution in θ.

Regarding θ, we have a canonical Brownian motion on the circle. The solution can be

expanded in the Fourier basis as

Pθ(t, θ) =

+∞

Xk=−∞

ak(t) eikθ with ak(t) = e−k2ηt/2 ak(0) .

In principle any initial distribution Pθ(0, θ) can be expanded on the Fourier basis functions,
the Dirac distribution, corresponding to our known starting position, corresponds to ak(0) =

8

1/(2π) for all k. As soon as t > 0 the series converges ﬁne, and for large t we converge towards
the uniform distribution. Alternatively, one can write the Gaussian solution for a Brownian
motion on the line and wrap it around the circle:

[HeH]

Pθ(t, θ) =

1

√2πηt Xk∈Z

e−(θ−θ0+2πk)2/2ηt

for which apparently there is no simpler expression, but which converges fast as a series.

Regarding z, although the SDE is purely diﬀusive it is not obvious to solve analytically.

We use the change of variables w = asinh(

the latitude on the Bloch sphere tan λ =
w ∈ [−∞, +∞] and we have the Fokker-Planck equation

z√1−z2 ) , such that w is close to the tangent of
z√1−z2 . This maps the interval z ∈ [−1, 1] onto

Deﬁning Pw(t, w) = cosh(w)Qw(t, w)e−η t/2 we get

∂Qw
∂t

=

∂2Qw
∂w2 .

This is the Fokker-Planck equation of a canonical Brownian motion, whose Gaussian solution
starting at w = w0 writes

Qw(t, w) =

1

√2πηt

e−(w−w0)2/2ηt .

Converting back to Pw, the whole expression simpliﬁes considerably and we are just left with
two Gaussians with opposite drifts of the mean:

[HeH]

Pw(t, w) =

2cosh(w0) √2πηt (cid:18)ew0 e

(cid:19) .

(16)

This expresses exactly how the distribution converges towards the steady states z = +1 and
z = −1, which would be the end-result for a projective measurement of σz. The two Gaussians
indeed separate, since their drift is in t while their standard deviation grows in √t. Moreover,
one checks that
, i.e. the relative weight between the Gaussians matches the
relative probabilities of measuring +1 or −1 in a projective measurement of σz. See ﬁgure 3
for illustration.

Figure 3: Left: A few probability distributions of type (16) with measurement of σz, converted
into probability distributions on the Bloch sphere latitude λ = asin(z) for η = 1. The system
starts slightly above the Bloch sphere equator, at λ0 = 0.2. Right: Evolution in time of the
fraction of trajectories that are in the southern hemisphere of the Bloch sphere, for the same
data as the left plot. The horizontal line depicts the fraction of detections z = −1 expected
in a projective measurement of σz.

For the homodyne σ− measurement, the symmetry is broken as the noise part is reduced to
a σ− + (σ−)† = σx operator, without the same on i σ− + (iσ−)† = σy. Hence it is easier to
study in the Cartesian Bloch sphere coordinates,

[HoN ]

dx = −x/2 dt + √η((1 + z) − x2) dWt
dy = −y/2 dt + √η(−xy) dWt
dz = −(1 + z) dt + √η(−x(1 + z)) dWt .

4.1 Deterministic curves

We have the following deterministically evolving components.

Theorem 2:
(a) The qubit governed by the SDE (17) remains at all times conﬁned to the curve deﬁned by

[HoH]

and

r2 + bt (1 − z2) = 0 , where

bt = b0 e−2(1−η/2)t ∈ [0, 1] .

Like for the heterodyne measurement, this can be checked just by writing the dynamics
of the proposed coordinates and checking that (i) they are inﬂuenced by no noise components
directly and (ii) they obey an autonomous diﬀerential equation. The presence of a single noise
component is a necessary condition for having the distribution of states supported, at any
time, on a curve in the Bloch sphere; however as we will see in Section 5 it is not suﬃcient,
due to condition (ii).

Regarding the geometry of the support curve:
• For σz we have a straightforward variation of the heterodyne case, i.e. the support is

the curves represented on Fig. 1(left) and contained in the plane θ = θ0.

• For σ−, the ﬁrst set of deterministic submanifolds (associated to ct) have the same shape
as for the heterodyne case, namely the curves represented on Fig. 1, in the plane x = 0.
However, while for the heterodyne case the submanifolds are generated by rotation of
those curves around the z axis, for the present homodyne case they are obtained by
translating these curves along the x axis. The second set of manifolds, associated to ft,
correspond to the planes parallel to the x axis and through the point z = −1. As ft
increases in time, those planes move from vertical towards horizontal. Note that this
evolution is independent of η and has two invariant surfaces: a stable one at ft = +∞,
whose intersection with the Bloch sphere is the single state z = −1; and an unstable one
at ft = 0, corresponding to the plane y = 0 which includes both z = −1 and z = +1.
The intersection of these two sets of surfaces gives a set of curves with z maximum in
the plane x = 0, and getting more and more horizontal.

This is consistent with an information-theoretic interpretation: only variations in the x
direction, through the associated information gain, might imply that energy increases
over some parts of the trajectory, while transversely to the x direction (variable ft) the
energy decreases deterministically.

The points z = ±1 for σz (resp. z = −1 for σ−) are still the only points which do not
correspond to unique values of b0 (resp.c0, f0); and they are still equilibrium points, where
the coeﬃcient of the noise vanishes and the state will stay forever.

4.2 Distribution on the curves

Case of σz: The remaining stochastic diﬀerential equation is like for the heterodyne case,

The same change of coordinates and solution are thus valid: with w = asinh(

Case of σ−: This case is similar to the heterodyne one, but without the variable θ. Since
the marginal distribution on z now contains all the information, in fact we follow the steps of
the corresponding heterodyne case without the θ-dependent expansion, taking directly k = 0.

We start from the stochastic diﬀerential equation

dzt = −(1+zt) dt −p2ηp(1+zt) − ct(1+zt)2 (1+zt) dWt

11

which is obtained by replacing xt according to Theorem 2(b). This is the similar replacement
as for rt in the heterodyne case, so we try a similar change of variables:

χ =

2η (1+z)2 = (cid:16) 1

This yields

dχt = √2√χt dWt +(cid:18)χt +

and deﬁning again Fχ = Pχ/(ct + ηχ) we get

∂Fχ

∂χ2 + (3/2 − χ)

∂χ − 2Fχ .

Pursuing the same approach again leads to a Kummer type diﬀerential equation (13) with
now a = 2 − s and b = 3/2. For a = −n a negative integer, the solutions of this equation
include the generalized Laguerre polynomials L(α)

n (χ) with α = 1/2.
Thus an initial condition concentrated at χ = χ0 can be written

5 When is a qubit conﬁned to a deterministic surface or curve?

The fact that the SDEs (3) to (6) feature deterministically evolving submanifolds has appeared
as a surprise to us. It is certainly not implied directly by the fact that they are governed
by less than 3 noise channels. Indeed, even if there is a single noise term, its combination
with deterministic drift can spread out the state of an SDE into several dimensions. This is
essentially the same principle of nonholonomic motion that allows a car to park sidewards. For
a generically selected SDE, one would rather expect that associated nonholonomic constraints
cannot be integrated, and diﬀusion indeed takes place in all directions.

Given the observations on (3) to (6), a natural question is whether the conﬁnement to
submanifolds is a particularity of the chosen Lindblad operators, or maybe a more general
property of quantum dynamics. It turns out that it is the former, as we next show for the
qubit. Towards better readability, we only summarize the results in this section. Their proof
is based on a powerful tool of control theory, namely an algebraic criterion to analyze directly
from a vector ﬁeld in how many dimensions a system can spread. The latter is recalled in the
Appendix, which also discusses its speciﬁc adaptation to quantum systems.

This general theory allows in just a few systematic minutes to retrieve the existence of
the deterministic submanifolds of Sections 3 and 4, without having to construct their explicit

12

form. We will ﬁrst consider the case when all the channels are monitored. We then illustrate
a few relevant cases with unmonitored channels. Our general assumptions are:
(i) We can start from any point inside the Bloch sphere, i.e. we do not consider cases implied
by special initial conditions (like a pure state).
(ii) The relative strenghts of the diﬀerent Lindblad operators are not precisely tuned, i.e. we
do not consider cases where the drift implied by one operator would precisely cancel an eﬀect
of another operator.
(iii) Similarly, the values of the ηj are not precisely tuned towards cross-cancelations, except
for the case η = 1 which we sometimes treat independently.

5.1 One-dimensional submanifolds

Proposition 3: Consider a qubit subject to a single arbitrary Lindblad operator L. The state
remains conﬁned to a deterministic time-varying curve in the Bloch sphere if and only if

[L, L†] L = rL + cI

L = c1 σ−

or

for some r ∈ R and c ∈ C.
L = c1σz + c2I

This condition holds iﬀ
c1, c2 ∈ C.
Proof: According to the theory in Appendix, staying on a curve imposes on the Lie algebras
generated by the vector ﬁelds, that GF = G = span(GL1 ). Obviously, for any single arbitrary
operator L, we have G = span(GL) since [L, L] = 0. Incorporating the drift term towards GF
imposes that the vector ﬁeld generated by [L, L†] L must be collinear with the one generated
by L.

in some basis and for some

A general operator L can be written as L = ασz + βiσx + γiσz + cI for α, β, γ ∈ R and

c ∈ C, without loss of generality modulo a unitary change of basis. We then get

[L†, L] L = [2ασz, L] L = −4αβ σy L .

Writing it out, we see that having this last expression collinear with L requires either β = 0,
or α = 0, or L = α(σz ± iσx). The latter case is essentially L = c1 σ−; indeed recall that
σ− ∝ (σx + iσy) and that eiφσ− = U σ−U† with U = diag(eiφ, 1) a unitary change of basis.
The others cover the case L = c1σz + c2I.

(cid:3)

The cases of Section 4 are readily checked. For L = σ− we have [σ+, σ−] σ− = −σ−.

For L = σz we get [σz, σz] σz = 0.
The latter is recovered as the second case in Proposition 4, with c2 = 0 and c1 real. For c1
imaginary we get a Hamiltonian rotation, at stochastic speed, around the z axis. For general
complex c1, the system moves on the surface described by (19) and undergoes a stochastic
rotation proportional to its latitude change, hence remaining on an inclined curve inscribed
in that surface.
Ex.1.a: Interestingly, the above shows that e.g. for L = σz + σ−, the system would not
remain conﬁned to a curve, even though we have a single noise channel. One checks indeed
that

[L†, L] L = −L − 2iσy =: −L + 2L′ .

(22)

13

5.1.1 Several Lindblad operators

With the restrictions imposed by Prop.3, it is not diﬃcult to see that staying on a deterministic
time-varying curve in presence of several Lindblad operators requires very special conditions.

Proposition 4: Consider a qubit subject Lindblad operators Lj, j = 1, 2, .... The state
remains conﬁned to a deterministic time-varying curve in the Bloch sphere if and only if

Lj = c0σz + cjI

for all j in some basis and for some c0, cj ∈ C.

Proof: To keep the Lie algebra G as deﬁned in the appendix one-dimensional, we already need
Lj = L1 + cj I with some cj ∈ C. Combining this with the still necessary requirements for
a single L1, we see that the case L1 = σx + iσy drops out (unless Lj = L1 for all j which is
an artiﬁcial case). For the only remaining case, the properties (33) and GL+αI = GL ensure
that indeed, the system would remain conﬁned to a deterministic curve.
(cid:3)

5.2 Two-dimensional submanifolds

Let us ﬁrst clarify when a single monitored channel L can conﬁne the system to a two-
dimensional submanifold of the Bloch sphere.

Proposition 5: Consider a quantum master SDE (2) on a qubit with H = 0 and a single,
monitored operator L.

• If η < 1 , then the system starting at a generic ρ(0) will diﬀuse in all 3 dimensions
of the Bloch sphere, except for the cases in Prop.3 , where it stays on a deterministic
curve.

in some basis, with any β, r ∈ R, or
• If η = 1 and either L = σx + iβσy + r I
L = σx + i√1 + r2σy + r iI in some basis, with any r ∈ R, then the system starting

at any ρ(0) remains conﬁned to a 2-dimensional deterministically evolving submanifold.
Else, except for the cases in Prop.3, the system starting at a generic ρ(0) diﬀuses in all
3 dimensions of the Bloch sphere.

Proof: Again we write a generic L and examine the algebraic conditions in the appendix.
Throughout the proof we exclude the cases already covered in Section 5.1. Note that for
η < 1, as we assume that η is not precisely tuned, both the part in η and the part in (1− η) of
the drift (30) must be considered independently towards building GF . In particular the vector
ﬁelds associated to the following commutators belong to GF as constructed with Prop.B.6:

L = ασx + βiσy + γiσx + cI
[L†, L] L = L′ ∝ βσx − γσy + cσz + αiσy

[L, L′] ∝ −βcσx + γcσy + (β2 + γ2 − α2)σz − αciσy − 2αγiσz .

Their linear dependence is examined with Proposition B.5. Note that c can be complex, so
terms must be slightly regrouped. Satisfying the ﬁrst criterion of Prop.B.5 requires Im(c) = 0,
then γ = 0 and (β2 − α2 + |c|2) = 0. The second criterion of Prop.B.5 gives no new solution.
The third criterion is the most general and allows to have just γ = Im(c) = 0 or γ = Re(c) = 0.

14

It then remains to check the Lie bracket between GL′ and FL + DL.

- For η = 1, this reduces to investigating the commutator Q2 = (cid:2)L′ , (L† + L) L(cid:3). For c real

we get

Q2 ∈ span(σx, σz, iσy) .

Such operator obviously satisﬁes the third item of Prop.2.A together with L and L′. Hence
GQ2 can be expressed as a linear combination of GL′ and GL, so the whole GF = span(GL′, GL).
Thus: L = σx + iβσy + rI is good.
- For η = 1 and c = i r imaginary we get

Q2 ∝ αβσx + (β2 − r2)iσy + αr iσz .

In this case we have GQ2 ∈ span(GL, GL′) only when β2 = r2 + α2.
- For η < 1, we have additional terms in [FL + DL, GL′]. For c real, the GQ1 term in (30)
admits the same property as for GQ2, but the remaining term belongs to span(GL, GL′) only
when L takes one of the forms leading to a 1-dimensional manifold (see Prop.3). This can be
checked rather easily by writing out the dynamics on the Bloch coordinates and checking the
determinant of the 3×3 matrix concatenating (i) this vector ﬁeld, (ii) GL and (iii) GL′.
- For η < 1 and c = i r imaginary, the Q1 is as well parallel to L′ so the GQ1 term of (30)
lies in the already generated subspace of GF . And again, the remaining term with [L, L′]ρL†
adds a third direction to the Lie algebra, unless r = 0.
(cid:3)

Ex.1.b: Let us pursue Ex.1.a and check whether for L = σz + σ−, the system might be
conﬁned to a 2-dimensional time-dependent submanifold of the Bloch sphere for η = 1 (for
η < 1 we already know from Prop.5 that this is not possible). The answer is positive, since

L = (σz + σx/2) + iσy/2 would ﬁt one of the cases of Prop.5 after a rescaling by p5/4 and a
rotation around the y axis that brings p4/5(σz + σx/2) onto σx. We can also check that how

concretely this operator satisﬁes the algebraic rank constraints. Resuming from (22), we get

(cid:2)L, L′(cid:3) = L + 1

2 L′ − 5

2 σx .

We thus already have span(Gσx , Giσy , Gσz ) ⊆ GF . This matches the form of the third case in
Prop.B.5 for a two-dimensional vector ﬁeld, i.e. if GF contains no further element then the
system would evolve on a 2-dimensional surface.

For η = 1, this is conﬁrmed by noting that (L† + L)L = ασx + βσz + rI for some
α, β, r ∈ R. Thus examining [FL + DL, GLk ], which by (30) is essentially determined by
2Q2 = [Lk, (L† + L)L], with Lk ∈ {σx, iσy, σz} yields no new terms in GF . The equation of
the corresponding submanifold is given by (28).
For η < 1, the same applies to 2Q1 = [Lk, L†L]. The remaining term is more cumbersome
to treat; a numerical test, at a random ρ, readily shows that the generated vector ﬁeld adds
a third direction; so the system diﬀuses in all directions. (cid:3)
Ex.2: According to Prop.5, the single operator L = σ− + i σx would spread the state in 3
dimensions, even for η = 1. One easily generates a few low-order Lie brackets from GF and
checks, on a random ρ, that they indeed yield 3 linearly independent motion directions. (cid:3)

5.2.1 Several Lindblad operators

Let us now move to dynamics involving two independent operators L1 and L2. Examining this
with the tools of the Appendix involves the algebra generated by the commutator between

15

L1 and L2. An easily treated example is the heterodyne measurements of Section 3.

Ex.3: Consider a heterodyne measurement, with two measurement operators L and i L. Since
[L, iL] = 0 and FL = Fi L, the possible motions are just the vector sum of those generated in
the homodyne case with L and with i L. Thus when homodyne measurement of L keeps the
system on a deterministic curve (case of Prop.3), the corresponding heterodyne measurement
keeps the system on a 2-dimensional submanifold. For η = 1, other homodyne measurements
might conﬁne the system to a 2-dimensional submanifold (Prop.5), but one checks that then
the heterodyne measurement always spreads it in 3 dimensions. (cid:3)

Finally, we can investigate which other pairs of measurement operators L1, L2 might keep
the qubit system on a deterministic submanifold. It turns out that, at least for η < 1, only
the two heterodyne measurement cases of Section 3 do.

Proposition 6: Consider a quantum master SDE (2) on a qubit with H = 0, several moni-
tored operators Lk and ηk ∈ (0, 1). For any initial state ρ(0), the qubit state ρ(t) at each time
t > 0 will be restricted to a deterministically evolving 2-dimensional manifold if and only if
one of the following conditions is satisﬁed in some basis:

• There exist βk, αk ∈ C such that Lk = βk σz + αkI
• There exist βk ∈ C such that Lk = βk σ−

for all k.

for all k.

Proof: The drift is now the sum of two terms FL1 + FL2. Recall that we assume the relative
strength of L1 and L2 is not precisely controlled. Therefore we can consider each drift in-
dependently, i.e. in the algebraic conditions of the appendix GF is the smallest Lie algebra
containing G and closed under Lie brackets with both FL1 and FL2 (instead of just with their
In particular, GF (L1) ⊆ GF and GF (L2) ⊆ GF , so with Prop.5 for η < 1 we are
sum).
already restricted to

UjLjU†j ∈ {c1σz + c2I, σ−|c1, c2 ∈∈ C}

with some unitary changes of coordinates Uj ∈ SU (2).
Investigating those cases (see Ap-
pendix C), we in fact ﬁnd that no other pair L1, L2 than the ones listed above satisﬁes the
Lie algebra condition.
(cid:3)

Ex.4: For η = 1, the commutation formula based on GQ2 and Prop.B.5 allow to identify a
set of possibilities as listed in Appendix C, Proposition C.8, for which the state would remain
on a 2-dimensional submanifold. This holds for instance for L1 = iσ1 and L2 = iσ2, for any
two zero-trace Hermitian operators σ1 and σ2 (case [C]). One easily checks, via Itˆo calculus,
that the deterministic surface is simply

d(x2 + y2 + z2) = 0

which is not really surprising. Obviously in this case, having any number of measurement
operators Lk = iσk, with the σk zero-trace Hermitian, will not change this property. However
for η < 1, due to non-commuting actions if [σ1, σ2] 6= 0, the state would diﬀuse in all three
dimensions. (cid:3)

16

5.3 Adding unmonitored channels

For completeness we can brieﬂy mention an analysis with unmonitored channels, ηj = 0.
We consider the physically typical phase decoherence channel L3 = σz in addition to the
measured L1 = σ− (and L2 = iσ−, in the heterodyne case).
Proposition 7: Consider a quantum master SDE (2) on a qubit with H = 0, an unmonitored
operator L1 = σz with η1 = 0.

• For a heterodyne measurement with L2 = σ− and L3 = iσ− and η2, η3 ∈ (0, 1), the state

will diﬀuse in all 3 dimensions of the Bloch sphere.

• For a homodyne measurement with L2 = σ− and η2 ∈ (0, 1), the qubit state ρ(t) at each

time t > 0 will be restricted to a deterministically evolving 2-dimensional manifold.

Proof: Unlike in the previous section, the Lie algebra G is generated only by σ− (and iσ−, in
the heterodyne case). Towards computing GF , we must ﬁrst apply the general formula (30)
of Prop.B.6, with k ∈ {2, 3} and j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. For j = 2, 3 we have checked in Prop.3 that
the Lie brackets vanish. For j = 1, note that there is no Itˆo vs. Stratonovitch correction since
there is no associated noise (η1 = 0). Furthermore the term in Q2 vanishes since η1 = 0; the
term in Q1 vanishes as [Lk, L†1L1] = [Lk, I] = 0. The remaining term, for j = 1 and k = 2,
yields a vector ﬁeld

[Fσz , GL2] := ˜G : (dx, dy, dz) = (z − 1 − x2, −xy, x − xz) .

The latter is not collinear with GL2.
- For heterodyne measurement, at a generic point of the Bloch sphere, this spans a three-
dimensional space together with Gσ− and Giσ− .
- For homodyne measurement, we must check further Lie brackets. Since ˜G is not of the
form GL for some L, we cannot apply (25) nor Prop.B.5 directly. Hence we just look di-
rectly at the vector ﬁelds in Bloch coordinates. We get [ ˜G, GL1] ∈ span( ˜G, GL1 ) and also
[Fσz , ˜G] ∈ span( ˜G, GL1).

(cid:3)

6 Conclusion

In this paper we give analytic expressions for the distribution of state (ρ) of a qubit system
governed by speciﬁc quantum SDEs. The success of our analysis relies on the fact that
the system remains conﬁned to a lower-dimensional, deterministically evolving manifold for
(almost) all realizations of the noise processes. Hence in a second step, we identify and adapt
to the case of open quantum systems, a system-theoretic tool which allows to systematically
check whether such conﬁnement of the system occurs. We apply this method to the qubit
case and conclude that essentially, the two main situations explored in recent experiments are
the only ones where such deterministic conﬁnement occurs. The system-theoretic method,
recalled in appendix, is richer than the ones that characterize invariants of quantum systems,
because we can identify when the system remains on a submanifold even if (and in some sense,
independently of the fact that) this manifold is time-varying. For instance for the qubit under
σ− measurement, the manifold deterministically collapses towards the ground state.

17

We must stress that our characterization of Lindblad operators for which the system
remains on a deterministic submanifold assumes a generic starting point ρ(0), generic values
of the ηk and of the relative strengths of the diﬀerent operators. When one restricts the system
for instance to start on the surface x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 of the Bloch sphere, these conditions are
not necessary, in particular those proposed in Proposition B.5. Nevertheless, the algebraic
approach proposed in appendix remains fully applicable and adaptable — we just want to
avoid singling out too many sub-cases. Future work could investigate how general conﬁnement
to submanifolds is in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

The a priori description of quantum evolutions proposed here is more informative than
the traditional solution ρ of the deterministic Lindblad equation [8], which just represents the
average state of the system over the noise realizations. Our results show that the distribution
around this average state can take quite particular forms. Such characterization can be of
practical importance towards more eﬃciently estimating how the quantum system behaves
in all situations where it is partially observed, including estimation of model parameters and
feedback stabilization. It might indeed be important towards error correction or information
protection to know that the state, although not conﬁned to a protected subspace, remains on
a sort of protected nonlinear submanifold.

Although everywhere-singular diﬀusion appears special in the context of noise-driven pro-
cesses, in a control engineering context the motion achievable with a reduced number of
inputs has been well characterized. In the present section we want to show how the powerful
tools developed for control engineering allow to readily check whether a quantum stochastic
diﬀerential equation contains hidden deterministically evolving submanifolds.

A. The classical case

The main idea is to consider the noises as — incidentally random — control inputs. This can
be formally justiﬁed by the Stroock-Varadhan theorem [11], which we recall here as adapted
from [4].

Proposition A.0: Consider a stochastic diﬀerential equation

support of the distribution of xt can be described as the closure, for the natural Banach topology
on C([0, 1], RN ), of the set of solutions of the following controlled system:

This link is central because the support of a controlled system (24), especially its dimen-
sion, has been well characterized in the literature. We are interested precisely in cases where
this support is of dimension N − n for some n > 0, indicating the presence of n deterministic
coordinates.

We ﬁrst need a few deﬁnitions. Given two vector ﬁelds F and G on the same manifold,
their Lie bracket [F, G] = FG − GF corresponds to the Lie derivative of F along G minus the
Lie derivative of G along F . The result is a vector ﬁeld which needs not be parallel to neither
F nor G, and it gives an idea of motion directions generated by alternating inﬁnitesimal
motions using F and G.

Deﬁnition A.1: The Lie algebra G generated by vector ﬁelds G1, G2, ..., Gm is the smallest
algebra, closed under Lie brackets, that contains G1, G2, ..., Gm. In other words, it is the vector
space spanned by the G1, G2, ..., Gm and by all vector ﬁelds that are obtained by iterating Lie
brackets of these elements. Finally, the drift-preserved Lie algebra GF is the smallest Lie
algebra containing G and closed under Lie brackets with F , i.e. for any G ∈ GF we have
[F, G] ∈ GF . Note that F itself need not belong to GF .

t , u2

t , ..., um

Consider the controlled system (24). From a given initial condition x0, by selecting diﬀer-
ent control signals u1
t , the user can steer the system towards diﬀerent states xt at
time t. It is clear that if the Gj(x) span RN at almost every x (thus m ≥ N ), then the user
can steer the state in any direction. However, even for m < N , the system can still reach any
state if the Lie algebra G generated by G1, G2, ..., Gm spans RN . This indeed indicates that
by smartly alternating between G1, G2, ..., Gm, new directions of motion can eﬀectively be
obtained. This is the principle allowing a car to eﬀectively move sidewards by using the well-
known parking maneuver. The drift F alone does not imply control capabilities. However,
combining this drift with control ﬁelds might further help to steer the system in an unactu-
ated direction; e.g. an airplane whose translation velocity is ﬁxed can also move “sidewards”
with respect to its reference trajectory.

When the control inputs represent noise processes, deterministic evolution of some co-
ordinates correspond to cases where the noise controls cannot induce eﬀective motion in all
directions. More precisely, the concept that we examine is strong accessibility.

Deﬁnition A.2: The system (24) is strongly accessible at a point x0 if the set of all its
possible solutions xt at time t > 0, for all possible choices of the signals uj, forms an open
subset of RN . It is strongly accessible in N − n dimensions if the set of possible solutions all
lie in, and form an open subset of, an N − n dimensional submanifold of RN .

In this deﬁnition the set of all possible xt does not have to be a neighborhood of x0: whilst
spreading out along all dimensions, the state might also be subject to a drift. Replacing
controls by noises according to Proposition A.0, the N − n dimensions are those in which the
state eﬀectively diﬀuses stochastically (e.g. dimension of the set of points that the car with
Wiener as a driver can reach). The possible drift allowed by the deﬁnition expresses that the
manifold supporting the state distribution need not be invariant in time, but might evolve
deterministically.

The following result from control theory allows to assess the strong accessibility dimensions

of a controlled system from algebraic properties of its vector ﬁelds [6].

Proposition A.3: The system (24) with analytic functions F, G1, ..., Gm is strongly accessible

20

at x0 if and only if the Lie algebra GF associated to these vector ﬁelds has full dimension N
at x0. Moreover, if GF has dimension at most N − n < N for all x0, then the system stays
on a (time-dependent) manifold of dimension N − n, independently of the control inputs.

Proposition A.0 translates this directly to stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by

Wiener processes in Stratonovitch form.

B. The quantum case

In principle, Proposition A.3 can be applied directly to check whether a given quantum
stochastic diﬀerential equation on a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space features hidden deter-
ministically evolving coordinates. The vector ﬁelds F, Gj exactly match the expressions in
(1), only with x ∈ RN replaced by ρ ∈ RN×N which is still a vector space; and with the
notation referring explicitly to the operators Lj involved.
In the
following, spans or linear combinations are meant with real coeﬃcients whenever unspeciﬁed.

A few speciﬁcities of the quantum case can be addressed to facilitate its use.

B.1 Quantum operators vs. vector ﬁelds

The Lie algebra G associated to the noise terms can be computed directly from the quantum
operators. Indeed,

[GLj , GLk ] = G[Lj, Lk]

(25)

i.e. the Lie bracket between the vector ﬁelds translates into the commutator of the associated
quantum operators. The simple proof is included in the proof of Prop.B.6. Lie brackets with
drift terms are not (always) as easy to compute. Some formulas are provided later.

A related question is to decide, directly from the quantum master equation, when a set of
vector ﬁelds is linearly dependent. By linearity of GL in L and L†, it is clear that if L1, L2, L3
are linearly dependent with real coeﬃcients, then also GL1, GL2 , GL3 are linearly dependent.
This condition is however not necessary. For instance, L = I would give GI = 0 which is
collinear to any other vector ﬁeld. Thus this requires a bit more analysis.

We here only consider vector ﬁelds of the form GL with L independent of ρ. The results
of course remain valid for vector ﬁelds of the type Gg(ρ)L with g(ρ) a scalar real function,
since the ρ-dependence does not aﬀect the direction of the vector ﬁeld. Other cases do not
appear in the present paper. It is easy to check that GL+αI = GL for any operator L and
any α ∈ C (although the same is not true for FL). Therefore we assume trace(L) = 0 in all
the following investigations.
It is also important to note that we consider criteria for vector ﬁelds to be linearly depen-
dent on a dense subset of the Bloch sphere. E.g. when one restricts the system to start on
the surface x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 of the Bloch sphere, the following conditions are not necessary,
and the conclusions that make use of this result must be revised.

Proposition B.4: GL1 and GL2 are linearly dependent at each ρ if and only if L2 = αL1 for
some α ∈ R.
Proof: The ‘if’ direction is just a check. For the ‘only if’, we ﬁrst observe that collinearity of
the vector ﬁelds at ρ = I/trace(I) requires L1 + L†1 parallel to L2 + L†2, i.e. Lk = αkA + i Bk,
k = 1, 2 with A, B1, B2 hermitian operators and α1, α2 ∈ R.
• Assume α2 6= 0. Write ρ = I + ǫ¯ρ, write the collinearity condition GL1(¯ρ) = g(¯ρ)GL2(¯ρ)

21

for some scalar function g(¯ρ) (note that GL2 does not vanish in the neighborhood of ρ =
I/trace(I)), and expand g(¯ρ) in powers of ǫ. The ﬁrst order term requires the direction of
[α2B1 − α1B2, ¯ρ] to be independent of ¯ρ. For α2 6= 0 6= α1, this implies B1/α1 = B2/α2 hence
in fact L1/α1 = L2/α2. For α2 6= α1 = 0, this requires B1 = 0 hence in fact one vector ﬁeld
is absent.
• For α1 = α2 = 0 we get the condition [B1, ρ] parallel to [B2, ρ] for all rho. There are several
ways to show that also this must imply B1 = αB2 for some α ∈ R.

(cid:3)

With three vector ﬁelds, as the result appears to be nontrivial, we specialize to the qubit

case, where we can write a general operator as:

Lk = αkσx + βkσy + γkσz + i˜αkσx + i ˜βkσy + i˜γkσz .

(26)

We then deﬁne vr
then observe linear dependencies among GLk although the Lk are linearly independent.

k := (˜αk, ˜βk, ˜γk) ∈ R3 and vk = (vr

k := (αk, βk, γk) ∈ R3, vi

k, vi

Proposition B.5: Three operators L1, L2, L3 for a qubit system lead to vector ﬁelds GLk
whose directions are linearly dependent at each ρ, if and only if the operators’ expressions vk
according to (26) satisfy one of the following conditions.

1 = vr

3 = 0, while vi

(Note that if vr

Proof: The most direct way to reach the conclusion is to write the vectors ﬁelds in Bloch
coordinates x, y, z:

Gx = α − ˜βz + ˜γy − (αx + βy + γz) x
Gy = β − ˜γx + ˜αz − (αx + βy + γz) y
Gz = γ + ˜βx − ˜αy − (αx + βy + γz) z .

(27)

2 = vr

When vr

From this we immediately see that at x = y = z = 0 the vector ﬁeld is vr, so to have a
two-dimensional vector ﬁeld in the neighborhood of x = y = z = 0 we need the vr
k to be
linearly dependent.
1 = vr

3 = 0, we get a purely rotating vector ﬁeld, tangent to the surfaces
x2 + y2 + z2 =constant; this is case 2. If we are not in this situation, without loss of generality,
we can assume v1 := (1, 0, 0, ˜α1, ˜β1, 0). Since GLk is linear in the coeﬃcients of vk, taking linear
combinations of the vk will not change the linear dependencies in the GLk . (In particular, if
v3 can be expressed as a linear combination of v1, v2, then also GL3 can be expressed at any
point as the same linear combination of GL1, GL2 , which directly gives the ﬁrst case; we will
recover this from the following general case.) We can thus take such linear combinations as
long as we keep track of them to re-express the original conditions on v1, v2, v3. Given the

22

form of v1, we can make α2 = α3 = 0 possibly after transforming v2, v3 by linear combination
with v1. Then given linear dependency of the vr

k we can make vr

3 = 0.

From there, we obtain the result by explicitly examining linear dependence between the
three instances of (27). Write out the determinant of the 3×3 matrix for the general case,
this gives a polynomial in x, y, z whose coeﬃcients must all equal zero. Manageable condi-
tions on the parameters are obtained by evaluating the polynomial at smartly selected points
e.g. x = y = z, and this gives the announced result.
(cid:3)

- In the second case all the Lk would be skew-Hermitian, and the resulting dynamics is
a pure rotation of the Bloch vector; one then easily understands that if those were the only
terms in the dynamics, whatever noises are applied, the system would stay on a manifold of
constant purity.

- An example of the third case would be L1 = σx + βiσz, L2 = σz − βiσx and L3 = i σy;
this is general modulo basis change and taking real linear combinations. One checks that this
set is also closed under commutators, i.e. [Li, Lj] ∈ span{ L1, L2, L3 } for all i, j. In fact, both
GL3, and cos φ GL1 + sin φ GL2 for a point where x cos φ + z sin φ = 0, imply rotations around
the y axis of the Bloch sphere. The second motion direction is given by cos φ GL2 − sin φ GL1 .
One then sees that dc is not inﬂuenced by noise for

c =

1 − (x2 + y2 + z2)

(y + β)2

.

(28)

In Section 5.1, example 1.2, this situation appears in actual deterministic submanifolds —
i.e. in combination with the associated drift ﬁelds — for a case with η = 1.

To conclude this section, we must note that vector ﬁelds resulting from brackets with the
drift F need not be of the form GL, and thus may require further investigation towards linear
dependencies.

B.2 Stratonovitch vs. Itˆo

The quantum master equation must be understood in the Itˆo sense, while the correspondence
between Wiener processes and controls in Prop. A.0 holds in the Stratonovitch sense. The
translation between these two formalisms involves a correction on the drift term:

where Gj(x)ℓ denotes the component ℓ of the vector Gj in some basis. In general, these two
diﬀerent meanings of SDEs do not yield the same results for the dimension of the support. 2

2For instance if F = 0, m = 1 it is clear that GF = span{G1} i.e. the controlled system (24) would move
in one dimension, the control only determines the speed of evolution in time. The same would be true for the

23

For the quantum master equation, we can give the explicit form directly for the commu-

tation of a Stratonovitch-corrected drift with a control vector ﬁeld.

Proposition B.6: In the quantum formalism, the Lie bracket between drift — translated to
Stratonovich form — and control terms is given by:

[FLj + DLj , GLk ](ρ) = (1 − ηj) (cid:16)[Lj, Lk]ρL†j − trace([Lj, Lk]ρL†j)ρ + h.c.(cid:17)

h.c. and u.i. denoting resp. hermitian conjugate, and unimportant terms towards Prop.A.3.

Proof: From (29), the Stratonovitch form of the quantum master equation is obtained by
replacing FLj by (1 − ηj) FLj + ηj (FLj + 1

ρ .

For a term f (ρ) linear in ρ, we have ∆gf |ρ = f (v(ρ)) where ∆g denotes the Lie derivative
along any vector ﬁeld g tangent to the state space at ρ. For nonlinear terms, one just applies
the Leibnitz rule. E.g. working out

∆gGL |ρ = L g(ρ) + g(ρ)L†

−trace(Lg(ρ) + g(ρ)L†) ρ
−trace(Lρ + ρL†) g

leads directly to (25). Applying a similar procedure to FLj + 1

The second line contains an operator in the form g(ρ) Lj with g a real scalar function of ρ.
Thus the associated vector ﬁeld is parallel to the already present vector ﬁeld GLj . Similarly,

Stratonovitch setting (23), with the Wiener process just randomly varying the speed of evolution. However
if e.g. G1(x)k = (xk)2, one computes that [D1, G1]k ∝ (xk)4. For almost all x ∈ RN , this vector ﬁeld is not
parallel to G1. This means that if F = 0 was meant in the Itˆo sense, the system would in fact not be conﬁned
to a one-dimensional evolution.

24

the ﬁrst line contains a term of the form g(ρ)[Lk, Lj], whose associated vector ﬁeld is already
in the Lie algebra G involving GLj and GLk , see the formula (25).

One easily checks that these terms do not aﬀect the Lie algebra at higher orders. Indeed,
the formula (25) conﬁrms that the commutation of a vector ﬁeld GLj with a vector ﬁeld
Gg(ρ)Lj
is identically zero. This expresses, as one would expect, that the accessible space
depends only on how the directions of the various vector ﬁelds change with ρ, not on their
local amplitude which can be readily compensated by a control u(ρ). By thus dropping these
unimportant terms in (31), we get the term in Q2 of (30).

The other terms in (30) are obtained directly by working out [FLj , GLk ] with Lie deriva-
(cid:3)

tives using the Leibnitz rule.

The general formula (30) is of limited use in practice, mainly because it is not of the form
GH (ρ) for any operator H. A nice theoretical case is when ηj = 1, and only GQ2(ρ) remains.
Another nice corollary, which appears in practice, is when [Lj, Lk] = 0:

Corollary B.7: If [Lj, Lk] = 0, then the Stratonovitch correction has no eﬀect on the Lie
bracket between drift associated to Lj and control terms associated to Lk in the quantum
master SDE. Moreover, the Lie bracket reduces to:

[FLj + DLj , GLk ] = GQ2)(ρ) with Q2 = 1

2 [Lk, L†j]Lj .

(33)

This case allows to make progress towards applying Prop.A.3 in practice, as it will appear

at least every time we check the bracket for j = k.

C. General form for L1, L2 conﬁning to a 2-dimensional submanifold

For η = 1, we have the following result. It goes beyond the scope of this work to provide
interpretations for all those cases.

Proposition C.8 Besides the cases of heterodyne or homodyne measurements, the pairs of
Lindblad operators L1, L2 which keep the system on a 2-dimensional submanifold of the Bloch

25

sphere comprise essentially:

[A] L1 = σz + r1 I

L2 = cos θ σz + sin θ σx + r2 I
with any θ, r1, r2 ∈ R

[B] L1 = i σz + c1 I
L2 = σx + r2 I

with any c1 ∈ C, r2 ∈ R

[C] L1 = i σz + c1 I

L2 = i (cos θ σz + sin θ σx) + c2 I
with any θ ∈ R, c1, c2 ∈ C
[D] L1 = cos θ1 σx + i sin θ1 σy + r1 I
L2 = cos θ2 σx + sin θ2 σz + r2 I
with any θ1, θ2, r1, r2 ∈ R
[E] L1 = cos θ σx + i sin θ σy + r1 I

L2 = iσy + c2 I

with any θ, r1 ∈ R, c2 ∈ C

[F ] L1 = σx + β1 iσy + r1 I

L2 = cos θ σx + sin θ σz + β2 iσy + r2 I

with any θ, β1, β2, r1, r2 ∈ R

[G] L1 = cos θ1 σx + i σy + sin θ1 i I

L2 = cos θ2 σx + i (cos φ σy + sin φ σz) + sin θ2 i I

with any θ1, θ2 ∈ R and φ = θ1 − θ2 .

Sketch of Proof: We illustrate the procedure when taking both L1 and L2 of the form eiφσz.
For the other cases, the approach is essentially the same, although the algebraic computations
can be tedious.

Without loss of generality, i.e. under unitary coordinate changes, the considered case is
represented by L1 = eiφ1σz + c1I and L2 = eiφ2 (ασx + γσz) + c2I. To avoid cases where GL1
and GL2 are already collinear — i.e. covered in previous paragraphs — we impose α = 1.
- We ﬁrst require G to remain two-dimensional, for which we need G[L1,L2] in the span of GL1
and GL2. From [L1, L2] = ei(φ1+φ2)iσy and Prop.B.5, we identify essentially three cases where
this holds: (L1, L2) = (iσz, i(σx + γσz) [case (a)], or (L1, L2) = (σz, σx + γσz) [case (b)], or
(L1, L2) = (iσz, σx) [case (c)]. In all these cases, arbitrary terms c1I and c2I may be added
to the operators.
- We have [FL1 + DL1, GL1 ] ∈ G and [FL2 + DL2, GL2] ∈ G because they were already
collinear with GL1 and GL2 respectively. Thus there remains to check, for the various cases
above, whether [FL1 + DL1, GL2] ∈ G and [FL2 + DL2, GL1] ∈ G. Using (30) for η = 1,
this investigation boils down to checking Q2 ∝ [Lk, (L†j + Lj)Lj]. For case (a), we have
(L†j + Lj)Lj = (cj + c†j)Lj hence Q2 ∝ [L1, L2]. For case (b), we have (L†j + Lj)Lj composed
of terms proportional to I, Lj, and cjLj. For cj complex this yields Q2 = Qa + Qb with
Qa ∝ Re(cj)[L1, L2], and Qb ∝ Im(rj)σy. The latter necessarily adds a third dimension to

26

GF ; thus we need Im(r1) = Im(r2) = 0. For case (c) we have the situation of case (a) or (b)
respectively, for j = 1 or j = 2, thus we need Im(r2) = 0. Then in all three cases, GF = G
and indeed the system would remain conﬁned to a two-dimensional submanifold of the Bloch
sphere.
(cid:3)

Towards proving Prop.6, we ﬁrst select the subcases from Prop.C.8 for which L1 individ-
ually (and L2 individually) would keep the system on a 2-dimensional manifold when η < 1,
according to Prop.5. We then compute the additional term of [FL1 + DL1, GL2] and write it
out in Bloch coordinates. We also write out GL1 and GL2 in Bloch coordinates. After con-
catenating those 3 vector ﬁelds in a 3×3 matrix, checking their linear dependence amounts to
checking the singularity conditions of the matrix. Doing this for the general case yields the
ﬁnal result.
