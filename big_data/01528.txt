Abstract We study the radiation of an inertial charge evolving on the expanding de
Sitter spacetime. Through a perturbative calculation, within scalar QED, we obtain
the transition amplitude for the process and from this we deﬁne the energy radiated
by the source. In the non-relativistic limit we ﬁnd that the leading term is compatible
with the classical result (Larmor formula). The ﬁrst quantum correction is found to
be negative, a result which is in line with a number of similar ﬁeld theoretical results.
For the ultra-relativistic case we ﬁnd a logarithmic divergence of the emitted energy
for large frequencies, which we link to the nature of the spacetime. We compare our
results with that of Ref.[5], where the authors make a similar calculation for a general
conformally ﬂat spacetime.

1 Introduction

It is a well known result in classical electromagnetism that accelerated charges radi-
ate.The emitted power is given by the famous Larmor formula [1]. The radiated energy
for a non-relativistic motion of the source, adjusted for units, can be written as

(cid:90)

Ecl =

6π

a2(t)dt

(1)

It is expected that the same result can be recovered from quantum theory in the limit
¯h → 0. Indeed, in Ref.[2], the authors obtained from scalar QED the lowest contri-
bution as being in agreement with the Larmor formula. They considered two distinct
cases of external electromagnetic ﬁelds that produce the same classical acceleration.
Interestingly, although the leading term in both cases agrees with the classical result,
the main quantum contributions diﬀer. Similar results were obtained in Refs.[3,4] in
a spatially homogeneous time-dependent electric ﬁeld and electromagnetic plane-wave
background.

A distinct problem is the radiation of a charge in a time-dependent spacetime. In
this case, in the GR picture, the source is inertial and the dynamic background plays
the role of the external ﬁeld. The problem was tackled in Refs.[5,6], for the general case

of a conformally ﬂat spacetime. In a calculation done in the WKB approximation, they
found that the leading term reproduces exactly the relativistic version of (1), when the
trajectory is written in terms of conformal time. The acceleration is dependent on the
scale factor of the spacetime and the momentum of the source.
Because of its privileged position in cosmological physics, the case of the de Sitter
spacetime deserves a separate, more detailed treatment. Our goal in this paper is to
recover the classical radiation and calculate the leading quantum corrections for a
charge evolving in the expanding de Sitter spacetime (dS). We approach the problem
with a perturbative calculation within scalar QED. We derive the radiated energy from
the 1st order transition amplitude of the process which is analogous to the classical
one.
The paper is structured as follows: In sec.II we gather the basics of QED on de Sitter
spacetime. In sec.III, starting from the transition amplitude, we deﬁne the energy
radiated through the process. We obtain an asymptotic form for the energy that is
valid in the weak gravitational ﬁeld domain and then go on to expand the result for
diﬀerent regimes of the motion of the source. In the non-relativistic limit, we obtain the
leading term which is compatible with the classical result and also the leading quantum
contributions in the powers of the Hubble constant. We obtain also a closed form for
the energy in the ultra-relativistic limit and proceed to integrate over all angles. We
ﬁnd that the resulting frequency distribution of the radiation is plagued by divergences
characteristic for dS. In sec.IV we summarize and discuss our main results. We work
in natural units where ¯h = c = 1.

2 Basics of QED on dS

The expanding patch of the de Sitter spacetime is described by the line element

ds2 = dt2 − e2ωtdx2 =

(ωη)2 (dη2 − dx2),

(2)

where ω is the Hubble constant, and we have introduced for convenience the time
parameter ωη = e−ωt, η ∈ (0,∞), with opposite sign as compared to what one usually
calls conformal time.

The scalar modes that deﬁne the Bunch-Davies vacuum are [7,8]

The electromagnetic ﬁeld is conformally invariant. The covariant components of
the Maxwell ﬁeld are thus identical to the Minkowskian counterparts, while the con-
travariant components can be obtained by raising the indices with the metric tensor,
resulting in1[9]:

equal to (−η) .

Following Ref.[10] we work with the e.m. ﬁeld in the Coulomb gauge, given by A0 =
0,

= 0.

Given the mode functions (3) and (4), we can write the usual mode expansion for

the scalar and Maxwell ﬁelds as:

a†(p), b†(p), c†(k) are the respective creation operators for the scalar particles, an-
tiparticles and photons.

We are interested here only in tree-level QED processes, that are generated by the

1st order term in the expansion of the S-matrix:

We have dropped the four-point interaction term because it does not contribute to the
process studied here.
We use a general prescription for interacting ﬁelds, following the classical textbook [7].
A detailed treatment of scalar QED on dS, including the reduction mechanism, can be
found in Ref.[11].

The transition amplitude can then be written generically as:

Ain→out = (cid:104)out| S(1) |in(cid:105)

3 Energy emission through QED process

We are interested in the quantum theoretical counterpart of a charge emitting electro-
magnetic radiation as a consequence of an external inﬂuence. In our case the charge
is inertial, the expanding background playing the role of the external inﬂuence. The
setup is as follows: in the initial state there is one scalar particle with momentum p(cid:48),
and in the ﬁnal state we have a photon with momentum k and an arbitrary state of the
scalar ﬁeld. We average over all conﬁgurations that are indistinguishable from the point
of view of a detector measuring the emitted radiation. This means basically summing
over all possible ﬁnal states of the scalar ﬁeld.

where a and b∗ represent the number of scalar particles and antiparticles. Notice that
the quantity (8) is independent of the deﬁnition of particles in the out state. Indeed this
is the case because we can factor out an identity in (8), which can in turn be replaced
by any complete orthonormal basis. The most natural way to proceed is in fact to

4

insert an in basis (built from the Bunch-Davies modes (3)), which then truncates the
sum at a ﬁnite number of terms. In our case, remembering that the interaction is 1st
order, we are left with the following terms:

E ∼(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)1k,λ; 1p |1p(cid:48)(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)1k,λ; 1p(cid:48) , 1q(cid:48) , 1∗q |1p(cid:48)(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

(9)

The ﬁrst term represents a particle emitting a photon, while the second term represents
the particle passing through without interacting, accompanied by the production of a
pair and a photon from the vacuum2. The two conﬁgurations are illustrated by the
Feynman diagrams Fig.1. A very important observation is that the second process
yields homogeneous and isotropic radiation. In an experimental context we can imagine
that the detector can be adjusted to account for this background radiation. We can
then drop this contribution and focus on the ﬁrst term only in (9).

2Note that momentum conservation constrains the momenta
p + k = p(cid:48) in the ﬁrst, and k + q + q(cid:48) = 0 in the second process.

In Ref.[12] we numerically analysed the result of the temporal integration and found
a closed, but obtuse, analytical form for the amplitude. Here instead we are interested
only in the weak gravitational ﬁeld limit
(m/ω → ∞). With this in mind, we search for an asymptotic expression of the ampli-
tude, in order to obtain the emitted energy as a power series in the Hubble constant
ω.

The energy emitted through the process can be computed as the energy of a pho-
ton ¯hk, weighted with the probability of emitting a photon with the corresponding
momentum. The expression for the energy can be written as:

3.2 Asymptotic expression in weak gravitational ﬁeld

We seek an asymptotic expression for the radiated energy in the weak gravitational ﬁeld
regime. The idea is to obtain the energy as a series in powers of the Hubble constant
ω and the analyse the diﬀerent contributions. The leading term should be independent
of ¯h, so that we can consider it the "classical" radiation, i.e. it should reproduce the
result obtained from classical electrodynamics. Our expectation is enforced by the
results obtained in ref.[5] for a conformally ﬂat universe (of which dS is a particular
instance of). The calculation in [5] was performed in the WKB approximation, and the
condition for weak gravitational ﬁeld (µ → ∞) indeed assures that the WKB condition
is fulﬁlled in our case also.

To obtain an asymptotic expansion of (10) we start by writing the Hankel functions

The temporal integral with the expansion (23) can not be solved analytically. To
continue, we need to further expand the asymptotic formula for small and large values

We can then properly consider pphys (cid:28) m to be a non-relativistic approximation, while

increasing amount of radiation in the backward direction. In order for formula (29) to

4 is due to the presence of the adiabatic cut-oﬀ. When we
The remaining factor of 1
take the limit  → 0 the energy diverges. This can be understood as follows: the role of
the cut-oﬀ is to decouple the ﬁelds and thus halt the interaction on time scales larger

than 1/. When we take the vanishing limit this is equivalent to considering an inﬁnite
interaction time. Then, the energy radiated with a constant rate, under an inﬁnite
time, will be inﬁnite. This also holds for a constantly accelerated charge in ﬂat space.
The results are consistent with that of Ref.[2].

Interestingly, if we naively take the non-relativistic limit in the results of Ref.[5] and
also consider the adiabatic cut-oﬀ, we would obtain a result that is only half of (31).
This is because their calculation was tailored for a conformally ﬂat spacetime with the
conformal time ranging over the complete real axis. For the particular case of dS, this
would mean the global de Sitter space. For the expanding patch of dS, described by
the line element (2), their calculation breaks down in eq.(30) when neglecting bound-
ary terms and in the subsequent integration over frequencies. If we where instead to
consider the non-relativistic approximation (z (cid:28) 1), by neglecting from the beginning
quantities of order (p/p0)2 (cid:39) z2 and with the adiabatic cut-oﬀ, the results would be
identical to ours.

Considering further the leading quantum correction

we see that it is negative. The fact that the quantum eﬀect suppresses the classical
result was reported in all similar studies [2,5,6,3,4] and thus seems to be a generic
feature.

3.4 Radiation in the ultra-relativistic limit

In this section we examine the behavior of the probability and the emitted energy
through the process in the ultra-relativistic limit. Starting from (23) and imposing the
condition for ultra-relativistic motion of the source (z (cid:29) 1), we obtain:

I ν
p,p(cid:48) (η) =

eiη(p(cid:48)

−p).

(35)

The energy radiated under a unit solid angle and in unit frequency thus becomes:

By integrating over the momenta of the photon we obtain the total energy emitted in
the process:

We have plotted the integrand of (41),which is the frequency distribution of the
energy, in ﬁg.(3). The bulk of the radiation is emitted under frequencies k ≤ p(cid:48) as
one would expect on physical grounds. For a small cut-oﬀ we see that most of the
radiation is emitted for small frequencies. Increasing the  parameter reveals that there
is actually another competing channel around k (cid:39) p(cid:48). This is not present in the non-
relativistic case. We can understand this as follows: because we are investigating the
process under weak gravitational ﬁeld conditions, there is a loose energy conservation
principle at action, which is reminiscent from ﬂat space. For the non-relativistic case,
where the energies go as ∼ p2, the photon momentum can not compete with the source,
and thus the only route towards energy conservation is p (cid:39) p(cid:48), k → 0. On the other hand
in the ultra-relativistic limit, because the energies go as ∼ p, the photon momentum
is on the same footing as the source momenta, and the channel with k (cid:39) p(cid:48), p → 0
becomes relevant. Thus we understand the peak at k (cid:39) p(cid:48) as arising from an interplay
between the gravitational ﬁeld, which gently lifts the energy conservation constraint,
and the relativistic regime, which puts the energy of the radiation on a par with that
of the source.

For large frequencies k > p(cid:48) we have a tail that falls-oﬀ as 1/k, which leads to a log-
arithmic divergence when integrated over. The presence of this divergence is intimately
linked to the famous divergence problem of de Sitter space [18]. We can understand
it as a symptom of the ﬁnite integration over conformal time in (14). Because the
Maxwell ﬁeld is conformal, the photon eﬀectively "lives" in conformal time and "feels"
the limit η → 0 as being abrupt, although in the physical picture everything seems to
be diluted away smoothly by the expansion of space. The ﬁnite limit for the temporal
integration manifests like a ﬁnite-time sudden cut-oﬀ which leads to transitory eﬀects,
undesirable divergences and other artifacts [20,21,22,23,24].

4 Discussion

In this paper we have analysed the quantum radiation of a charge evolving on the
expanding de Sitter spacetime. The emitted energy was derived from the transition
amplitude of the corresponding scalar QED process. We compared the results of our
perturbative calculation with that of Ref.[2], which was done in the WKB approxima-
tion. We have obtained the radiated energy as a power series in the Hubble constant,
in the asymptotic case of a weak gravitational ﬁeld. For a non-relativistic motion of the
source, we have found the leading term to be compatible with the expected classical
results. This is also identical to the results of Ref.[2], within the same approximation.
Furthermore, the leading quantum correction was found to be negative. This result,
that the quantum correction suppressess the classical result, was also reported in all
similar studies. In the ultra-relativistic limit we expected to obtain a result which takes
the form of the relativistic generalization of the Larmor formula. Instead we found that
the energy has a logarithmic divergence for large frequencies. We interpret this as fol-
lows: the ﬁnite integration limit for the conformal time mimics a sudden decoupling
of the interaction at time η → 0. Because this "event" happens under an arbitrarily
small time interval, arbitrarily high frequency modes can get excited. Thus we also
understand why this eﬀect does not show up in the non-relativistic case, where only
small frequency photons are emitted.

It would be interesting to see whether the above mentioned pathological ﬁngerprint
also shows up in a classical calculation, for the same setup. There are a number of
papers that deal with the radiation of classical charges evolving on the global dS [14,
15,16,17]. For the expanding patch of dS, the only study that we are aware of is done
in Ref.[19]. We note that our results are compatible with that of Ref.[19], in that we
ﬁnd that comoving observers see no radiation. Indeed if we set p = 0 in eq.(30) and
eq.(41) we ﬁnd vanishing energy in both non-relativistic and relativistic cases. It would
be interesting to do a systematic study in the lines of Ref.[1], of the classical radiation

0.51.01.52.0k2468dEdkϵ=100ϵ=10-1ϵ=10-213

emitted by charges on arbitrary trajectories on the expanding dS. Also it would be
interesting to see how our results change if we consider proper Dirac electrons.

One more thing is worth noting. It is a pleasing fact that out of all 1st order
processes the one studied here is the only one that falls oﬀ as an inverse power of µ as
we go towards the ﬂat space limit. As we have also signaled in Ref.[25], the probabilities
for all other 1st order processes are exponentially suppressed as e−α(θ)µ, including the
one depicted in Fig.(1b). This is linked to the fact that the process in Fig.(1a), that
forms the object of this study, is the only one that has a classical analogue.
