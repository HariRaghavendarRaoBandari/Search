Abstract

Isotope shifts of the 2p3/2-2p1/2 transition in B-like ions are evaluated for a wide range of the

nuclear charge number: Z = 8 − 92. The calculations of the relativistic nuclear recoil and nuclear

size eﬀects are performed using a large scale conﬁguration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm method.

The corresponding QED corrections are also taken into account. The results of the calculations are

compared with the theoretical values obtained with other methods. The accuracy of the isotope

shifts of the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition in B-like ions is signiﬁcantly improved.

INTRODUCTION

First measurements to isolate the isotopic variation of nuclear eﬀects in the binding

energies in few-electron highly charged ions were performed in Refs. [1–3]. The most precise

to-date measurements of the isotope shifts were carried out for B-like argon [4] and Li-like

neodymium [5]. These experiments allowed ﬁrst tests of the relativistic theory of the mass

shift with middle- and high-Z systems for the ﬁrst time.

From the theoretical side the ﬁrst evaluation of the isotope shifts in boronlike argon

was performed in Ref. [4, 6]. Later, systematic calculations of the relativistic nuclear recoil

eﬀect were performed by Kozhedub et al. [8], who used a large-scale conﬁguration interaction

Dirac-Fock-Sturm (CI-DFS) method, by Li et al. [9], who employed the multiconﬁguration

Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method, and also in our recent work [10], where the perturbation theory

calculations and the CI-DFS method were combined. The CI-DFS and MCDF methods

are simpler in using compared to the perturbative methods, but they show a rather poor

convergence in calculations of the speciﬁc mass shift. The results of the calculations of the

relativistic nuclear recoil eﬀect obtained by the CI-DFS method [8] were conﬁrmed by the

perturbative calculations of the interelectronic-interaction corrections to the mass shifts [10].

In Refs. [4–6] it was found that quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections to the isotope

shifts are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental uncertainties. Therefore,

the high-precision calculations of the isotope shifts have to take into account the QED

corrections.

The main goal of this paper is the high-precision evaluation of the isotope shifts for the

2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition in highly charged boronlike ions. Due to the relativistic origin of the

2p3/2 − 2p1/2 splitting, the study of this transition provides a unique opportunity for tests of

the relativistic and QED nuclear recoil eﬀects in the nonperturbative regime. This is due to

the fact that, in contrast to light atoms, the calculations of highly charged ions have to be

performed to all orders in the parameter αZ (α is the ﬁne structure constant and Z is the

nuclear charge number). It is expected that with new FAIR facilities [7] the experimental

accuracy of the isotope shift measurements with highly charged Li- and B-like ions will be

improved by an order of magnitude. To meet this accuracy, the high-precision calculations

of the relativistic and QED contributions to the isotope shifts must be performed. In our

calculations, along with the main contributions (the relativistic nuclear recoil and the nuclear

2

size eﬀect) the related QED corrections are also evaluated. Moreover, the calculations of

the QED corrections to the nuclear size contribution include the screening eﬀects, which for

the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 splitting in highly charged B-like ions are comparable with the ﬁrst-order

corrections. The calculations are performed for the nuclear charge number in a wide range:

Z = 8 − 92.

The relativistic units ( = c = 1) are used in the paper.

II. RELATIVISTIC NUCLEAR RECOIL EFFECT

To the lowest order in m/M, the relativistic nuclear recoil (mass shift) Hamiltonian HM

within the Breit approximation is given by [11–14]:

HM =

1

2M Xi,k h~pi · ~pk −

αZ

ri h~αi +

(~αi · ~ri)~ri

2

ri

i · ~pki,

(1)

where the indices i and k numerate the atomic electrons, ~p is the momentum operator, ~α

are the Dirac matrices.

The operator (1) can be represented by a sum:

HM = HNMS + HRNMS + HSMS + HRSMS,

where

is the normal mass shift (NMS) operator,

HNMS =

is the relativistic speciﬁc mass shift (RSMS) operator.

In the present paper, we evaluate the relativistic nuclear recoil contribution within the

Breit approximation to all orders in 1/Z. The calculation is carried out by averaging the

operator (2) with the eigenvectors of the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit (DCB) Hamiltonian:

∆E = hψ|HM |ψi,

(7)

where the wave function |ψi is evaluated using the conﬁguration-interaction Dirac-Fock-

Sturm method [6] for an extended nucleus. Details of the calculations are presented in Sec.

IV. An independent evaluation of the non-QED mass shifts based on the multiconﬁguration

Dirac-Fock method was presented in Ref. [15]. For B-like argon the results of this calculation

agree with those from Ref. [6]. In the present paper we extend the calculations of Ref. [6]

to B-like ions in the range Z = 8 − 92. The obtained non-QED results are combined with

the corresponding QED contributions evaluated to the zeroth order in 1/Z to get the most

accurate theoretical data for the mass shifts in highly charged B-like ions.

In Ref. [16], the nuclear size correction to the recoil operator (1) was studied for H-like

ions. It was found that for heavy ions this correction can amount to about 20 % of the total

nuclear size contribution to the recoil eﬀect. We estimate that this correction, combined with

the related QED nuclear size correction, should be within the total uncertainties presented

in this paper.

III. FINITE NUCLEAR SIZE EFFECT

The ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect (the so-called ﬁeld shift) is caused by the diﬀerence in the

nuclear charge distibution of the isotopes. The main contribution to the ﬁeld shift can be

calculated in the framework of the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The nuclear charge

distribution is usually approximated by the spherically-symmetric Fermi model:

ρ(r, R) =

N

1 + exp[(r − c)/a]

,

(8)

where the parameter a is generally ﬁxed to be a = 2.3/(4ln3) fm and the parameters N and

c are determined using the given value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius

R = hr2i1/2 and the normalization condition: R d~rρ(r, R) = 1. The potential induced by the

nuclear charge distribution ρ(r, R) is deﬁned as
∞

VN (r, R) = −4παZ

Z

dr′r′2ρ(r′, R)

1
r>

,

(9)

0

4

where r> = max(r, r′). Since the ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀect is mainly determined by the rms

nuclear charge radius (see, e.g., Ref.

[17]), the energy diﬀerence between two isotopes can

be approximated as

δEF S = F δhr2i,

(10)

where F is the ﬁeld shift factor and δhr2i is the mean-square charge radius diﬀerence. In

accordance with this deﬁnition, in the present paper the F -factor is evaluated by

F = hψ | Xi

dVN (ri, R)

dhr2i

| ψi,

(11)

where ψ is the wave function of the state under consideration and the index i runs over all

atomic electrons. These calculations, being performed by the CI method in the basis of the

Dirac-Fock-Sturm orbitals, are compared with the corresponding MCDF calculations of Ref.

[15], where the F -factor was approximated by

F =

2π
3

αZ| ψ(0) |2.

(12)

In addition, the QED corrections to the ﬁeld shifts have been evaluated. The calculations

have been performed by perturbation theory including the second-order screening eﬀects in

accordance with the technique presented in Refs. [18, 19].

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The nuclear recoil contributions can be represented in terms of the K-factor,

∆E =

.

Then, the isotope mass shift is determinated by

δEMS =

δM

(13)

(14)

where δM = M1 − M2 is the nuclear mass diﬀerence.

To calculate the relativistic nuclear recoil contributions, we use the large-scale

conﬁguration-interaction method with the basis of the Dirac-Fock-Sturm orbitals. The ex-

cited conﬁgurations are obtained from the basic conﬁguration via a single, double and triple

excitations of electrons. The accuracy of the calculations is deﬁned by a stability of the

5

results with respect to a variation of the basis size. In the present paper we use two diﬀerent

sets of the electron orbitals. In our notations, the middle basis is the basis which includes

all orbitals with the excitations up to (10s 10p 10d 10f 10g) shells. The large basis includes

the excitations up to (15s 15p 15d 12f 12g 12f ).

To estimate the quality of the bases used we have performed the following test. First of

all, we have extracted the contribution of the order 1/Z from the total value of the relativistic

nuclear recoil correction (7) obtained within the CI-DFS calculations. To this end, we have

used the procedure, which was described, for example, in Ref. [10] (see also Refs. [8, 20–22],

where a similar method was applied to separate the interelectronic-interaction contributions

of the diﬀerent orders in 1/Z). In accordance with this procedure, the DCB Hamiltonian is

represented as a sum of two parts:

H = H0 + λV,

H0 = Xi hh(i)
V = Xi<j

scri ,
D + V (i)
V (i, j) − Xi

V (i)
scr ,

V (i, j) = VC(i, j) + VB(i, j) =

α
rij

− αh ~αi · ~αj

rij

+

1
2

(~∇i · ~αi)(~∇j · ~αj)riji.

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

Here H0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian (hD is the one-electron Dirac Hamiltonian), V

describes the perturbation by the Coulomb and Breit interelectronic interaction, λ is a free

parameter with the physical value equal to 1, and the summation goes over all electrons

of the system. For each electron we have added some local screening potential Vscr to the

unperturbed Hamiltonian H0. To avoid the double counting, the corresponding contribution

has to be subtracted from the interaction part V .

For small λ, the nuclear recoil contribution can be expanded in powers of λ:

EMS(λ) = E(0)

MS + E(1)

MSλ +

∞

Xk=2

E(k)

MSλk,

where

E(k)

MS =

1
k!

dk
dλk EM S(λ)|λ=0.

(19)

(20)

It is easy to see that the coeﬃcient E(1)

MS corresponds to the contribution of the order 1/Z
to the total relativistic nuclear recoil correction (7). Calculating the derivatives we have

6

evaluated the ﬁrst-order corrections to the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition energies in B-like oxygen,

ﬂuorine, and uranium. The results of the calculations with the middle and large bases are

presented in the ﬁrst and second columns of Table I, respectively.

On the other hand, the ﬁrst-order relativistic nuclear recoil correction can be evaluated by

the standard perturbation theory. For a non-degenerate state a the corresponding correction

may be expressed in the following form:

E(1)
MS = 2Xn6=a

ha|HM |nihn|V |ai

εa − εn

.

(21)

Since we have introduced the screening potential into the zeroth-order Hamiltonian (16), we

can avoid the quasidegeneracy between 1s22s22p3/2 and 1s2(2p1/2)22p3/2 states that takes

place if the pure Coulomb ﬁeld is employed in the zeroth-order approximation. In the speciﬁc

calculations we use the local Dirac-Fock (LDF) screening potential [23].

From Eq. (1) one can see that the relativistic recoil operator HM mixes the states with

the diﬀerent values of the orbital quantum number l, but l can not diﬀer more than by unity.

All electrons in the states under consideration (1s22s22p1/2 and 1s22s22p3/2) have l =0 or

l = 1. Therefore, without loss of generality we can restrict the summation over the spectrum

in Eq. (21) to the summation over the s, p and d states. We have performed the calculation

of the relativistic nuclear recoil correction for the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition energies to the ﬁrst

order in 1/Z using Eq. (21). For this aim we have employed the extra large basis with the

number of the orbitals doubled: (30s 30p 30d). The results of this calculation are given in

the last column of Table I.

From Table I it is seen that for light ions the contributions of the order 1/Z to the recoil

eﬀect obtained with the middle and large bases diﬀer signiﬁcantly. It is clear that the middle

basis is not suﬃcient to perform the calculations for low- and middle-Z ions. At the same

time, the results of the calculations of the ﬁrst-order correction by the CI-DFS method

with the large basis and by the direct summation over the spectrum within the standard

perturbation theory are in a good agreement with each other. This agreement shows that

the total values EMS obtained in the large basis and the numerical derivatives in Eq. (20) are

evaluated with a good accuracy. Therefore, the ﬁnal calculations will be performed mainly

with the usage of the large basis.

In Table II the contributions to KNMS, KSMS, KRNMS, and KRSMS for the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2

transition in boron-like ions in the range Z = 8 − 92 are presented. To ﬁnd these corrections

7

we have averaged the relativistic nuclear recoil operators (3)-(6) with the CI-DFS functions.

The set of the conﬁguration state functions (CSFs) was obtained using the restricted active

space method with the single and double exitations only. Here, the basis of the virtual

orbitals was chosen in the middle form. Table III demonstrates the role of the triple excita-

tions. Comparing Table II and III, one can see that taking into account the triple excitations

changes the values of KNMS, KSMS, KRNMS, and KRSMS contributions slightly.

Further, in Table IV we present the results of the calculations of the individual contribu-

tions to the total values of the non-QED mass shift, which were obtained with the usage of

the large basis. It should be noted that the direct calculations including the triple excita-

tions turned out to be too time consuming. For this reason, the triple excitation contribution

∆triple was obtained as the diﬀerence between the total values KM S from Tables III and II.

This approach to the calculation of the triple excitation contribution was conﬁrmed by the

full CI-DFS calculation for the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition in B-like oxygen (K = −0.0979×102
GHz·amu) and in B-like uranium (K = −136.8 ×104 GHz·amu). Generally, our results are

in a reasonable agreement with the results of the MCDF calculations of Ref. [15]. However,

there is some discrepancy for the lightest ions (about 8 % for oxygen and ﬂuorine ions). The

reason for this discrepancy is unclear to us.

Finally, we should take into account the nuclear recoil eﬀects beyond the Breit approx-

imation (the so-called QED nuclear recoil terms). The calculations of the QED terms for

highly charged ions to the zeroth order in 1/Z were performed in Refs.

[8, 24–28]. In the

present paper, we have recalculated these corrections and found some misprints in Table 2
[24], where the two-electron contributions for the (1s)22p3/2 state were presented.

of Ref.

Namely, the values in the ﬁfth column of that table, which are supposed to be equal to the

sum of the values given in the second, third, and fourth columns, are incorrect. The correct

values are listed in Table V of the present paper. This table displays the total two-electron

mass-shift contributions of the zeroth order in 1/Z, which are expressed in terms of the

function Q(αZ):

∆E = −

m2
M

29
38 (αZ)2Q(αZ).

(22)

The calculations are performed for both point and extended nuclei. In the extended nucleus

case, the Fermi model of the nuclear charge distribution was used for Z ≥ 20 and the

model of the homogeneously charged sphere otherwise. The two-electron QED corrections

are obtained by subtracting the corresponding contributions in the Breit approximation.

8

In Table VI we present the total values of the mass shifts in the range Z = 8 − 92. The

total values of the non-QED mass shifts are deﬁned according to Table IV. Namely, the non-

QED contributions to the nuclear recoil eﬀect were evaluated with the usage of the CI-DFS

method, taking into account the single, double, and triple excitations. The QED corrections

have been evaluated in the independent-electron approximation. The calculations have been

performed for both the Coulomb potential and the eﬀective potential (the extended Furry

picture). As the eﬀective potential we have used the LDF potential.

The uncertainty was estimated as a quadratic sum of the uncertainty due to the CI-DFS

calculations, the uncertainty obtained by changing the potential from the Coulomb to the

local-Dirac-Fock in the QED contribution of the zeroth order in 1/Z, and the uncertainty due

to uncalculated QED contributions of the ﬁrst order in 1/Z. The latter one was evaluated

as the QEDCoul contribution of the zeroth order in 1/Z multiplied with a factor 2/Z ( in the

same way as in Ref. [10]). For Z ≥ 60, an uncertainty due to nuclear size corrections to the

recoil operator (including the QED part) has been also added.

To calculate the ﬁeld shift constants within the Breit approximation we have used the

CI-DFS method. Table VII presents the non-QED F -factor, obtained according to Eq. (11).

In the third column we give the DF results, while the fourth column presents the results of

the CI-DFS calculations, including the Breit electron-interaction correction. The results of

Ref. [15], where the formula (12) was employed, are presented in the last column. It can be

seen that the calculations by formula (12) have a rather poor accuracy for heavy ions. In

case of B-like molybdenum the discrepancy between the results obtained with the equations

(11) and (12) amounts to by about 7 %. Some discrepancy with the results of Ref. [15] for

low-Z ions can be explained by a rather strong cancellation of the signiﬁcant digits in the

2p3/2 − 2p1/2 energy diﬀerence, since in Ref. [15] the F -constants are presented only for the
1s22s22p1/2 and 1s22s22p3/2 states, and not for the diﬀerences. The uncertainty due to the

CI-DFS calculations was estimated as in the mass shift case.

In Fig. 1, we present the normalized FS constant for the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition, which

is determinated as ∆F/F0, where ∆F = F2p3/2 − F2p1/2 and F0 is the ﬁeld shift factor for

the 2p1/2 state of the corresponding H-like ion, obtained using analytical formulas from Ref.

[29]. In accordance with Ref. [29],

In Fig. 1, the dotted line indicates the results for the H-like ions obtained using Eq. (11), the

dashed line shows the results of the DF calculations using Eq. (11), the dashed-dotted line

stands for the CI-DFS calculations using the approximate formula (12), and the solid line

represents the results of the CI-DFS calculations using Eq. (11). We observe that for low-Z

ions the sign of ∆F becomes positive. This is due to diﬀerent (1s)2(2s)2 core polarizations by

the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states. We note also that this eﬀect is weaker in the CI-DFS calculations

(solid line) in comparison with the DF calculations (dashed line) because of the admixing

of additional conﬁgurations to the main conﬁguration.

Table VIII presents the QED corrections to the ﬁeld-shift F -constant for the 2p1/2 − 2s

and 2p3/2 − 2s transitions in high-Z Li-like ions, and also for the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition in

high-Z B-like ions. The ab initio calculations of the QED corrections to the ﬁnite nuclear

size eﬀect have been considered by perturbation theory in the ﬁrst two orders [18]. In the

case of the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition in B-like ions it turned to be very essential to take into

account the two-electron self-energy and vacuum polarization corrections. The one-electron

ﬁnite nuclear size QED corrections for the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states are signiﬁcantly smaller

than the corresponding corrections for the s-states. For this reason, although the screen-

ing contributions are generally suppressed by the factor 1/Z compared to the one-electron

contributions, the interaction with the 1s22s2 core makes the two-electron ﬁnite nuclear

size corrections comparable with the contribution of the leading order. Besides, owing to

the strong cancellation between the self-energy and vacuum polarization ﬁnite nuclear size

eﬀects on the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition, for high-Z ions it is also important to consider the

contribution from the energy dependence of the interelectronic interaction operator, that is

beyond the Breit approximation.

In our previous work [10] the QED corrections to the ﬁeld-shift F -constant for the 2p1/2 −

2s and 2p3/2 − 2s transitions in Li-like ions were taken into account using the approximate

analytical formulas for H-like ions from Refs. [30, 31]. This was done by multiplying the s-

state QED correction factor ∆s with the total nuclear size contribution to the corresponding

10

transition energy. The values of the QED corrections obtained in this way are also presented

in Table VIII. We note that for the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition in high-Z B-like ions the QED

corrections contribute on the level of the total uncertainty of the ﬁeld-shift F -constants.

In Table IX we present the isotope shift of the 2p3/2 −2p1/2 transition in B-like argon with
atomic numbers A=36 and A=40. The values of δhr2i1/2 are taken from Ref. [32]. The rel-

ativistic nuclear recoil and ﬁnite nuclear size eﬀects and the corresponding QED corrections

are taken from Tables VI and VII. The perfect agreement of the present theoretical value

with that of Refs. [4, 6, 15] and with the experiment [4] is observed. A small discrepancy of

the non-QED part between the present work and Ref. [15] is within the uncertainty.

In Table X we present the isotope shifts of the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition in B-like uranium

for two pairs of even-even isotopes, 238U87+ −236 U87+ and 238U87+ −234 U87+. The nuclear

polarization eﬀect was evaluated using the results of Refs. [33–36]. The nuclear deformation

eﬀect was calculated as in Ref.

[37], using the experimental [38] and theoretical [39] data

for the nuclear deformation parameters.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have evaluated the isotope shifts of the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2 transition energies

in boron-like ions. The conﬁguration-interaction method in the Dirac-Fock-Sturm basis

was employed to calculate the relativistic nuclear recoil and the ﬁnite-nuclear size eﬀects

within the framework of the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The obtained results are

compared with the previous related calculations. The QED nuclear recoil corrections have

been evaluated within the independent-electron approximation. The QED corrections to

the ﬁeld shift have been calculated by perturbation theory including the self-energy and

vacuum-polarization contributions of the zeroth and ﬁrst orders in 1/Z. As the results, the

most accurate theoretical predictions for the mass shifts and ﬁeld shifts of the 2p3/2 − 2p1/2

transition energies in boron-like ions have been obtained.
