ANALYSIS ABOUT FRACTIONAL INVERSE SCATTERING

PROBLEM

JUNXIONG JIA, SHIGANG YUE, JIGEN PENG, AND JINGHUAI GAO

Abstract. In this paper, we focus on a new wave equation described wave
propagation in the attenuation medium. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, based
on the time-domain space fractional wave equation, we formulate the frequency-
domain equation named as fractional Helmholtz equation. According to the
physical interpretations, this new model could be divided into two separate
models: loss-dominated model and dispersion-dominated model. For the loss-
dominated model (it is an integer- and fractional-order mixed elliptic equa-
tion), a well-posedness theory has been established and Lipschitz continuity
of the scattering ﬁeld with respect to the scatterer has also been established.
Because the complexity of the dispersion-dominated model (it is an integer-
and fractional-order mixed elliptic system), we only provide the well-posedness
result for suﬃciently small wavenumber. In the second part of this paper, a
well-posedness result (in the sense of Bayesian statistics) has been established
for a fractional inverse scattering problem related to the loss-dominated model.
Then we generalize the Bayesian inverse theory in inﬁnite-dimension to allow
a part of the noise depend on the target function (the function needs to be
estimated). This new theory has been named inﬁnite-dimensional Bayesian ap-
proximate error approach. At last, we apply our theory to the loss-dominated
model with absorbing boundary condition.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we focus on a fractional partial diﬀerential equation proposed
by geophysicist, which modeled the seismic wave propagation in the attenuation
medium. In order to understand this model clearly, let us recall some basic concepts
about attenuation. Usually seismic attenuation is characterized by the quality
factor Q which can be deﬁned as the ratio of stored energy W to the relative loss
of energy ∆W of a plane wave during a single cycle of sinusodia deformation[1]

The inverse of Q is related to the attenuation coeﬃcient α, the propagation velocity
c and frequency ξ:

Q =

4πW
∆W

.

In general, the amplitude loss is primarily linked to the response of the pore ﬂuid
to the passing wave. So seismic waves attenuate little in very dry rock (i.e. Q is
very large). Typically, a gas sand with 12% porosity has a quality factor Q of 5 to

10, whereas Q exceeds 100 for an oil-and water-saturated rock. Thus, attenuation
is large in rock with partial gas sturation and small in liquid-saturated rock [2].

To model the attenuation eﬀect, lots of models have been proposed [3, 4, 5] in
the researches about geophysics, for example in [4], the authors suggest to use the
following form of velocity to instead of the velocity in the non-attenuation model

c(x) = c0(x)(iω)γ(x)

π tan−1( 1

with γ(x) = 1
Q(x) ). For the attenuation eﬀect, the mathematical mono-
graph [6] also provides a simple description. If we write the Helmholtz equation on
inhomogeneous medium as follow

∆u + k2n(x)u = 0.

(1.1)

Then we may consider

n(x) = n1(x) + i

n2(x)

k

to incorporate the case of the absorbing medium. Everything appears to be perfect,
the attenuation problem seems already be incorporated into the enormous studies
about Helmholtz equations e.g. [26, 27, 30]. However, the attenuation eﬀect indeed
incorporate two eﬀects: amplitude loss and velocity dispersion. The aforementioned
models seem to mix these two eﬀects together, so we can not study the two eﬀects
separately.

Recently, a new model has been proposed which can separate the two eﬀects
incorporated in the attenuation eﬀect. Before revealing the form of this new model,
we would better provide some introduction about fractional time wave equation
model. Based on the Caputo’s fractional derivative, isotropic stress-strain (σ-)
relation could be deduced in the form [7]

σ =

M0
−2γ
t
0

∂2γ
∂t2γ ,

then the following Caputo’s wave equation has been established

∂2−2γ
∂t2−2γ u = c2ω−2γ∆u,

(1.2)

where c2(x) = c2
0(x) cos2(πγ/2). Here c0 is the sound velocity. γ is a function
related to the quality factor Q, that is γ → 0 as Q → ∞ and γ → 1/2 as Q → 0.
Then J. M. Carcione et al [8, 9] successfully solved the fractional time wave equa-
tion using Grnwald-Letnikow and central-diﬀerence approximations for the time
discretization and Fourier method to compute the spatial derivative. To solve these
fractional equations need large computational resources for the time derivative con-
tained memory eﬀect. If we attempt to convert equation (1.2) to time-harmonic
equation, we may not assume the solution has the form e−iωtu(x) for the frac-
tional time derivative has very diﬀerent properties compared to the ﬁrst order time
derivative [13]. Actually, we may attempt to assume the solution as follow

(u0E2−2γ,1(−ω2−2γt2−2γ) + u1E2−2γ,2(−ω2−2γt2−2γ))u(x),

(1.3)
where Eα,β(·) denotes Mittag-Leﬄer function [12]. Time fractional wave equation
describes the constant Q attenuation (Q is constant in frequency domain) precisely,
however, it is hard to solve and as presented before it also mix amplitude loss eﬀect
and velocity dispersion eﬀect together.

FRACTIONAL SCATTERING PROBLEM

Now, we can present the new space fractional model proposed by T. Zhu, J.M.
Carcione, J.M. Harris [10, 11]. Based on the Caputo’s wave equation (1.2), after
some intricate calculations in the angular and space frequency domain, T. Zhu,
J.M. Carcione, J.M. Harris propose the following space fractional model

1

c(x)2

∂2

∂t2 u = −η(x)(−∆)γ(x)+1u − τ (x)

∂
∂t

(−∆)γ(x)+1/2u,

with coeﬃcients vary in space as follows:

η(x) = c0(x)2γ(x)ω−2γ(x) cos(πγ(x)),
τ (x) = c0(x)2γ(x)ω−2γ(x) sin(πγ(x)).

(1.4)

(1.5)

Here let us provide some explanations for the notations used in (1.4) and (1.5). ω
denotes as a reference frequency, c0(x) denotes as the phase velocity, c(x) represents
the space acoustic velocity. The fractional power γ(x) relate to the quality factor
as

γ(x) =

.

(1.6)

Obviously, we have 0 < γ(x) < 1
2 . This model can be simpliﬁed as two sepa-
rate models, one is dispersion-dominated wave equation, another one is amplitude
loss-dominated wave equation. The dispersion-dominated wave equation has the
following form

∂2

∂t2 u = −η(−∆)γ+1u.

The amplitude loss-dominated wave equation has the following form

∂2

∂t2 u = ∆u − τ

(−∆)γ+1/2u.

(1.7)

(1.8)

Hence, it is clear that this space fractional model has two advantages: ﬁrstly, it can
be solved quickly by spectral methods [14] or other numerical methods; secondly,
it separates dispersion eﬀect and amplitude loss eﬀect, so researchers are able to
study the two parts separately and obtain complete understanding of attenuation
eﬀect.

In this paper, our aim is to study the time-harmonic solution of equation (1.4).

As usual, assuming the solution has the following form

e−iωtu(x),

then we derive an equation named fractional Helmholtz equation as follow:

−η(−∆)γ+1u + iωτ (−∆)γ+1/2u + k2(1 + q(x))u = 0,

(1.9)
where ω denote the angular frequency, k represent the wavenumber, q(·) is a func-
tion assumed to be larger than −1. From the formula (1.6), we know that if the
medium is dry rock, there will be very weak attenuation eﬀect. In this case, Q → ∞,
that means γ → 0. Then the fractional Helmholtz equation (1.9) could be reduced
to the non-attenuation model

∆u + k2(1 + q(x))u = 0.

(1.10)

This new fractional model brings new mathematical problems, e.g., could we build
well-posedness theory for equation (1.9), in addition, could we construct inverse

4

scattering theory for this fractional Helmholtz equation? Because the fractional el-
liptic equation is also a new topic in the ﬁeld of elliptic partial diﬀerential equations,
construct well-posedness results of equation (1.9) seem to be a diﬃcult problem.
In this paper, we ﬁrst concentrate on loss-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation
derived from equation (1.8)

∆u + iωτ (−∆)γ+1/2u + k2(1 + q(x))u = 0,

(1.11)

then we discuss dispersion-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation derived form
equation (1.7) as follow:

(−∆)γ+1u − k2γ+2(1 + q)u = 0.

(1.12)

Two scattering ﬁeld equations are obtained, one is based on (1.11) and the other one
is based on (1.12). Under suitable assumptions stated in assumption 1 in section 3,
a well-posedness theory with general wavenumber k > 0 has been constructed for
the former one. For the latter one, the problem seems to be diﬃcult. We can only
constuct a unique solution for suﬃciently small k > 0. Because the studies about
fractional Laplace operator which is a representative of non-local operators are a
rather new topic in the ﬁeld of elliptic partial diﬀerential equations, the theories for
this operator are little compared to the traditional second order elliptic operator.
Considering the diﬃculties brought by the fractional Laplace operator, our new
results are non-trivial generalizations of the results about second-order Helmholtz
equation (1.10).

At this stage, the forward models proposed in this paper are clear, however,
we are not content with this.
In the second part of this paper, we attempt to
construct the Bayesian inverse theory for the fractional Helmholtz equation, that
means construct statistical inverse framework for the fractional scattering problem.
Now let us recall some basic developments in the Bayesian inverse theory. Gener-
ally speaking, statistical inversion theory reformulates inverse problems as problems
of statistical inference using Bayesian statistics. There are usually two philosophies
in statistical inverse theory. One is ﬁrstly discretize the forward problem then us-
ing Bayesian methodology to a ﬁnite-dimensional problem (“discretize ﬁrst, inverse
second” denotes shortly as DFIS). The book [36] provides an excellent introduction
for DFIS method, especially large inverse problems arising in diﬀerential equations.
Another one is to construct Bayesian inverse theory in inﬁnite-dimension, discretiza-
tion of the continuous problem is postponed to the last step (“inverse ﬁrst, discretize
second” denotes shortly as IFDS). IFDS method could be dating back to 1970,
Franklin [16] formulated PDE inverse problems in terms of Bayes’ formula on some
Hilbert space X. Franklin derived a regularization using the Bayesian approach
and obtained the relation between regularization techniques and the Bayesian ap-
proach. Recently, S. Lasanen [17, 18, 19, 20] developed fully nonlinear theory. S.
L. Cotter, M. Dashti. J. C. Robinson, A. M. Stuart, K. J. H. Law and J. Voss
[38, 39, 40] established a mathematical framework for a range of inverse problems
for functions, given noisy observations. They revealed the relationship between
regularization techniques and the Bayesian framework and estimated the error of
the ﬁnite-dimensional approximate solutions.

Recently, Bayesian approximation error approach has been proposed in the book
[36] and paper [45], which can handle model reduction errors. In paper [44], the
Bayesian approximation error approach has been used in full-wave ultrasound to-
mography. Considering this method we can obtain acceptable inversion results

FRACTIONAL SCATTERING PROBLEM

but use only very rough approximation forward solver, which may be a promising
method could be used in geophysical explorations. For the fractional inverse scat-
tering problem considered in the ﬁrst part of this article, the forward solver usually
takes much computational time. Hence Bayesian approximation error approach will
be a good choice for our problem. Because Bayesian approximation error approach
has been developed by the researchers who use DFIS methodology, there seems
no mathematical analysis in inﬁnite-dimension. In the second part of this paper,
we ﬁrst analyze fractional inverse scattering problem with loss-dominated equa-
tion in the mathematical framework developed in [38], then we construct inﬁnite-
dimensional version of Bayesian approximation error approach. Compared with the
traditional inﬁnite-dimensional Bayesian approach, our approach include a model
reduction error which is not independent with the target function.

The contents of this paper are organized as follows.

In section 2, notations
are introduced and some basic knowledge of the fractional Laplace operator is
presented. In section 3, we construct the well-posedness theory for the scattering
ﬁeld equation related to the loss-dominated equation ﬁrstly. Secondly, we construct
the well-posedness theory for a scattering ﬁeld equation related to the dispersion-
dominated equation with suﬃciently small wavenumber.
In section 4, we prove
a well-posedness result under probability sense for an inverse fractional scattering
problem related to loss-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation. Then a general
inﬁnite-dimensional Bayesian approximation error approach has been constructed.
In the last, we apply this new theory to the inverse fractional scattering problem
related to the loss-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation.

Actually, there are at least ten equivalent deﬁnitions about fractional Laplace op-
erator and the equivalence has been proved in an interesting paper [22]. Since in
section 3, we may need to face fractional elliptic equations in bounded domain,
here, we present the deﬁnition of regional fractional Laplacian [23]. Let Ω be a
bounded domain in Rn, denote by L1(Ω) all the measurable function u on Ω such

we give the following deﬁnition [23].

x ∈ Ω, and for a real number

δ > 0, we set Ωδ := {x ∈ Ω, : 0 < ρ(x) < δ}. Let β > 0 be a real number, deﬁne

3. Forward Problem

In this section, we attempt to construct well-posedness theory for the loss-
dominated fractional Helmholtz equation and the dispersion-dominated fractional
Helmholtz equation. Before going further, let us make more speciﬁc assumptions
about these two equations and the following assumptions are valid in all of the rest
parts.

Assumption 1:
(1) In order to make our presentation more concisely, without loss of generality,

we may assume the space dimension n = 2.

8

J.X.JIA, S. YUE, J. PENG, AND J. GAO

(2) q(·) is assumed to be a bounded function and has compact support. Denote
BR as a ball centered at the original, then there exist R > 0 such that
supp(q) ⊂ BR.
In addition, we assume that there exists two constant
qmin, qmax such that −1 < qmin ≤ q(·) ≤ qmax < ∞.
(3) γ is a piecewise constant function, and without loss of generality, in this
paper we assume γ(x) = ˜γ1Ω, where Ω is a subset of BR ( ¯Ω (cid:36) supp(q) (cid:36)
BR) and ˜γ is a constant in [0, 1/2].
(4) η, τ are assumed to be two non-negative piecewise constant functions related
to γ. Let ˜η, ˜τ be to two positive constants, τ (x) = ˜τ if γ(x) (cid:54)= 0 and τ (x) = 0
if γ(x) = 0. η(x) = ˜η if γ(x) (cid:54)= 1/2 and η(x) = 0 if γ(x) = 1/2.

Remark 3.1. All the assumptions in assumption 1 are based on the physical model.
For example, if we assume γ(x) = 0 in (1.5), then τ (x) = 0 for sin(πγ(x)) = 0 and
if we assume γ(x) = 1/2 in (1.5), then η(x) = 0 for cos(πγ(x)) = 0.

Figure 1 presents the assumptions stated in assumption 1 for the relation between
the area with attenuate media Ω, the support of the scatterer supp(q) and the circle
with radius R clearly.

Figure 1. The relation between the area with attenuate media Ω,
the support of the scatterer supp(q) and the circle with radius R.

Since one advantage of space fractional wave equation is that it can separate
amplitude loss eﬀect and dispersion eﬀect, we could study loss-dominated equation
and dispersion-dominated equation separately.

3.1. Loss-Dominated Model. In this subsection, we focus on the loss-dominated
model. Based on the time-domain equation (1.8), we can easily derive the following
frequency-domain model named loss-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation as
follows:

(3.1)

(3.2)

∆u + iωτ (−∆)γ+1/2u + k2(1 + q(x))u = 0

in R2.

As usual the scatterer is illuminated by a plane incident ﬁeld

uinc(x) = eikx·d,

BRsupp(q)mediumwithoutattenuationΩattenuatemediumFRACTIONAL SCATTERING PROBLEM

9

where d = (cos(θ), sin(θ)) ∈ S1 = {x ∈ R2 : |x| = 1} is the incident direction and
θ ∈ (0, 2π) is the incident angle. Evidently, the incident ﬁeld satisﬁes

∆uinc + k2uinc = 0

in R2.

Before going to set up the scattering problem, we need the following formula:

(−∆)αeikx·d = k2αeikx·d with 0 < α < 1.

(3.3)

(3.4)

Proof. The proof of formula (3.4) relies on the fourier transform. In the following,
we denote A ≈ B as cB ≤ A ≤ CB with c, C are general constants. Since

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

then we have

e−iξ·x(−∆)αeikx·d ≈ |ξ|2α

e−iξ·xeikx·ddx

≈ |ξ|2αδ(ξ − kd),

eiξ·x|ξ|2αδ(ξ − kd)dξ ≈ k2αeikx·d.

Hence, formula (3.4) holds obviously.

(cid:3)

(3.7)

(3.8)

The total ﬁeld u consists of the incident ﬁeld uinc and the scattered ﬁeld us:

u = uinc + us.

(3.5)

It follows form (3.1), (3.3), (3.5) and formula (3.4) that the scattered ﬁeld satisﬁes

∆us + iωτ (−∆)γ+1/2us + k2(1 + q(x))us = (−k2q(x) − iωτ k2γ+1)uinc

(3.6)
in R2. By our assumption, function γ is zero outside Ω which is contained in a
ball with radius R, so the scattered ﬁeld as usual should satisfy the Sommerfeld
radiation condition:

√

lim
r→∞

r (∂rus − ikus) = 0,

where r = |x|.

In the domain R2\ ¯Ω, equation (3.6) reduced to

∆us + k2us = −k2quinc.

This is just the equation in the classical scattering theory, so we know that the
solution of equation (3.6) in R2\ ¯BR can be written under the polar coordinates as
follows:

Let B : H 1/2(∂BR) → H−1/2(∂BR) be the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator

Using the DtN operator, the solution in (3.9) satisﬁes the following transparent
boundary condition

on ∂BR,

(3.11)

where n is the unit outward normal on ∂BR. Now the problem can be converted to
bounded domain. Since we consider the bounded domain problem, the fractional
Laplace operator may needed to be adapted to the regional fractional Laplace
operator introduced in section 2.2. Remembering the assumption 1, for clarity, we
write the bounded elliptic problem as follow

∆us + iωτ A˜γ+1/2

on ∂BR.

Now, the key step is that how to set up the weak formulation of the above problem
(3.12), for a good formulation will make our analysis simple. Since there is Laplace
operator in equation (3.12), we may expect that the solution u belongs to H 1(BR).
Hence, for z ∈ ∂Ω, we may have

N 2−2(˜γ+1/2)u(z) = N 1−2˜γu(z) = lim

Now by (3.15) and (3.18), we easily obtain the variational form of equation (3.12)
as follows:

a(us, ϕ) = b(ϕ) ∀ ϕ ∈ H 1(BR).

(3.21)

For a given scatterer q, fractional order function γ and an incident ﬁeld uinc, we
deﬁne the map S(q, γ, uinc) by us = S(q, γ, uinc), where us is the solution of the
problem (3.12) or the variational problem (3.21). It is easily seen that the map
S(q, γ, uinc) is linear with respect to uinc but is nonlinear with respect to q, in
addition, γ is assumed to be known in the fractional scattering problem. Hence,
we may denote S(q, γ, uinc) by S(q)uinc. Concerning the map S(q), we have the
following regularity result.

Theorem 3.3. Let 0 < ˜γ < 1/2, if the wavenumber k is suﬃciently small, the
variational problem (3.21) admits a unique weak solution in H 1(BR) and S(q) is
a bounded linear map from L2(BR) to H 1(BR). Furthermore, there is a constant
C depend on BR and (cid:107)q(cid:107)L∞(BR), such that

(cid:107)S(q)uinc(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ Ck(cid:107)uinc(cid:107)L2(BR).

(3.22)

The proof is inspired by the method used in [26, 27, 28, 29] for integer order

Helmholtz equations, here, we give a sketch for concisely.

Proof. Deﬁne

a1(us, ϕ) = (∇us,∇ϕ) − iωτE N
a2(us, ϕ) = −((1 + q)us, ϕ).

Ω (us, ϕ)− < Bus, ϕ >,

It is obvious that a = a1 + k2a2. Since

then, for a1, we could obtain

L2(BR) + |ωτ|E N
H 1(BR),

Ω (us, us) + C(cid:107)us(cid:107)2

L2(∂BR)

where we used Theorem 2.6.4 in [31]. Then we deﬁne an operator A : L2(BR) →
H 1(BR) by

a1(Aus, ϕ) = a2(us, ϕ),

∀ ϕ ∈ H 1(BR).

Using the Lax-Milgram lemma, it follows that

(cid:107)Aus(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ C(cid:107)us(cid:107)L2(BR).

Deﬁne a function w ∈ L2(BR) by requiring w ∈ H 1(BR) and satisfying

a1(w, ϕ) = b(ϕ) ∀ ϕ ∈ H 1(BR).

(3.23)

(3.24)

It follows from the Lax-Milgram lemma again that

(cid:107)w(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ C(k2(cid:107)q(cid:107)L∞(BR) + |ω|τ k2˜γ+1)(cid:107)uinc(cid:107)L2(BR).

(3.25)
Using the operator A, we can see that problem (3.21) is equivalent to ﬁnd us ∈
L2(BR) such that

(I + k2A)us = w.

(3.26)

FRACTIONAL SCATTERING PROBLEM

13

When the wavenumber is small enough, the operator I +k2A has a uniform bounded
inverse. Then we have the estimate (cid:107)us(cid:107)L2(BR) ≤ C(cid:107)w(cid:107)L2(BR). Rearranging (3.26),
we have us = w − k2Aus, so we obtain

(cid:107)us(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ (cid:107)w(cid:107)H 1(BR) + Ck2(cid:107)us(cid:107)L2(BR) ≤ Ck(cid:107)uinc(cid:107)L2(BR),

where we used (3.25) in the second inequality.

(cid:3)

In order to obtain similar result for a general wavenumber k > 0, we need the

following uniqueness result.
Lemma 3.4. Given the scatterer q ∈ L∞(BR), the direct scattering problem (3.18)
has at most one solution.

Proof. It suﬃce to show that us = 0 in BR if uinc = 0 (no source term). From the
Green’s formula and fractional Gauss-Green formula (Lemma 2.4), we have

Now based on same ideas in the proof of Theorem 2.6.5 in [31], we obtain that
us = 0 on ∂BR. The boundary condition (3.11) yields further ∂us
∂n = 0 on ∂BR.
Hence, we easily see that us = 0 in R2\BR. Now, let us recall that for uinc = 0, we
have

(cid:40)

∆us + iωτ ALus + k2(1 + q)us = 0

in BR

(3.27)

Taking absolute value on both sides of the above equation, we obtain that

|∆us|2 + ω2τ 2|ALus|2 ≤ |k2(1 + q)us|

for x ∈ BR.

Hence, it is obvious that

|∆us(x)|2 ≤ |k2(1 + q(x))us(x)|

for x ∈ BR.

From the results in [32], us = 0 in BR.

(cid:3)

With the above lemma, we could obtain the following result for general k > 0

by using Fredholm alternative theorem.
Theorem 3.5. Given the scatterer q ∈ L∞(BR), the variational problem (3.21)
admits a unique weak solution in H 1(BR) for all k > 0 and S(q) is a bounded
linear map from L2(BR) to H 1(BR). Furthermore, the estimate

(cid:107)Suinc(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ C(cid:107)uinc(cid:107)L2(BR),

holds, where the constant C depends on k, BR and (cid:107)q(cid:107)L∞(BR).
Theorem 3.6. Assume that q1, q2 ∈ L∞(BR). Then

(cid:107)S(q1)uinc − S(q2)uinc(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ C(cid:107)q1 − q2(cid:107)L∞(BR)(cid:107)uinc(cid:107)L2(BR),

where the constant C depends on k, BR and (cid:107)q2(cid:107)L∞(BR).

Proof. Let us

j + k2(1 + qj)us

2 = S(q2)uinc. It follows that for j = 1, 2

By setting δus = us

1 − us

2, we have

∆δus + iωτ ALδus + k2(1 + q1)δus = −k2(q1 − q2)(uinc + us
2).

The function δus also satisﬁes the boundary condition

∂nδus = Bδus

on ∂BR

Using similar methods in proving Theorem 3.5, we could obtain that

(cid:107)δus(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ C(cid:107)q1 − q2(cid:107)L∞(BR)(cid:107)uinc + us

2(cid:107)L2(BR).

Using Theorem 3.5 for us

2, we have
(cid:107)us

2(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ C(cid:107)uinc(cid:107)L2(BR),

which gives

(cid:107)S(q1)uinc − S(q2)uinc(cid:107)H 1(BR) ≤ C(cid:107)q1 − q2(cid:107)L∞(BR)(cid:107)uinc(cid:107)L2(BR),

where the constant C depends on k, BR and (cid:107)q2(cid:107)L∞(BR).
3.2. Dispersion-Dominated Model. In this section, we focus on the dispersion-
dominated model. Based on the time-domain equation (1.7), we can easily get the
following frequency-domain model named dispersion-dominated fractional Helmholtz
equation as follows:

(cid:3)

(−∆)γ+1u − k2γ+2(1 + q)u = 0

in R2.

(3.30)

It is obvious that model (3.30) is a higher order elliptic equation, so we may transfer
it to lower order elliptic systems. As in the above section, the total ﬁeld u consists
of the incident ﬁeld uinc and the scattered ﬁeld us:

with uinc(x) = eikx·d. Using formula (3.4), we will obtain
(−∆)γ+1uinc − k2γ+2uinc = 0.

u = uinc + us,

(3.31)

(3.32)

Now, we easily obtain the scattered ﬁeld us satisﬁes

(−∆)γ+1us − k2γ+2(1 + q)us = k2γ+2quinc.

(3.33)
Because (3.33) is a 2γ + 2 ≥ 2 order elliptic equation, this equation seems more
diﬃcult than the loss-dominated equation.
By our assumption, in the domain Ω ⊂ supp(q) ⊂ BR the medium has atten-
uation eﬀect and in BR\Ω there is no attenuation eﬀect. Hence, we may see that
(−∆)γ is some “perturbation” of the non-attenuation equation and the higher order
equation (3.30) could be transformed to the following form:



(−∆)gs − k2(1 + q)us = k2quinc

case, we consider bounded domain equation, hence, we may replace (−∆)˜γ to A˜γ

Based on these considerations, we obtain the following elliptic system

Theorem 3.7. Let 0 < ˜γ < 1/2, for a large enough constant C > 0,

For the above system (3.48), performing same procedure from (3.41) to (3.44), we
could obtain that

Form our assumption, we ﬁnd that

(cid:107)δgs(cid:107)H 1(BR) + (cid:107)δus(cid:107) ˙H ˜γ (Ω) < (cid:107)δgs(cid:107)H 1(BR) + (cid:107)δus(cid:107) ˙H ˜γ (Ω).

Hence, the proof is completed.

(3.51)

Intuitively, we could obtain higher regularity properties of us, however, to our
knowledge, there is no rigorous results about interior and boundary regularity for
equation (3.51). Because the studies about regularity properties of elliptic equation
with operator As
Ω is also a new topic in elliptic equation ﬁeld [21, 23, 35], a rigorous
investigation of equation (3.51) deserved to write another paper. Hence, we would
not investigate further on the equation (3.51) in this paper.

Remark 3.9. Equation (3.33) seems much more diﬃcult than the loss-dominated
equation (3.1). For general k, we can not provide a uniqueness result similar to
Lemma 3.4. There also seems no uniqueness continuation results for fractional
Laplace operator as in the integer-order case [32]. Hence, the dispersion-dominated
equation needs further investigations.

4. Inverse Methods

In this section, we will construct Bayesian inverse theory for the fractional scat-
tering problem. Because this may be the ﬁrst time to attempt to construct an
inverse theory of the fractional scattering problem in Bayesian framework, we fo-
cus only on the loss-dominated case. In addition, if well-posedness theory for the
dispersion-dominated equation for general k > 0 could be constructed, then we

18

may follow the steps below to construct Bayesian inverse theory for the dispersion-
dominated case.

4.1. Bayesian Approach for Functions.

4.1.1. General Theory. Firstly, let us give some basic notations in Bayesian ap-
proach. Let x denotes an unknown function that we wish to determine from a
ﬁnite-dimensional vector y of observations (actually y can be chosen in an inﬁ-
nite dimensional space [37]). We assume that the observations are related to the
unknown function x by

y = G(x) + η.

(4.1)

Here η is an unbiased observational noise which, for simplicity, we take to follow
the Gaussian law N (0, Γ). The operator G is the observation operator which maps
the unknown functions into the data when no observational noise η is present.
We assume that x is in a Banach space (X,(cid:107) · (cid:107)X ) and that y ∈ RJ . We deﬁne
Φ : X × RJ → R by

Φ(x; y) =

|Γ−1/2(y − G(x))|2.

1
2

(4.2)

Denote the prior measure of x as µ0, and the posterior measure of x by µy. Ac-
cording to the theories developed in [38], we need the following assumptions.

Assumption 2: The function Φ : X × RJ → R satisﬁes the following:
(1) there exist p > 0 and for every r > 0 a K1 = K1(r) > 0 such that, for all

x ∈ X and y ∈ RJ with |y| < r,

0 ≤ Φ(x; y) ≤ K1(1 + (cid:107)x(cid:107)p

X );

(2) for every r > 0 there is K2 = K2(r) > 0 such that, for all x1, x2 ∈ X and

y ∈ RJ with max{(cid:107)x1(cid:107)X ,(cid:107)x2(cid:107)X ,|y|} < r,

|Φ(x1; y) − Φ(x2; y)| ≤ K2(cid:107)x1 − x2(cid:107)X ;

(3) there is q ≥ 0 and for every r > 0 a K3 = K3(r) > 0 such that, for all

y1, y2 ∈ RJ with max{|y1|,|y2|} < r, and for all x inX,
X )|y1 − y2|.

|Φ(x; y1) − Φ(x; y2)| ≤ K3(1 + (cid:107)x(cid:107)q

The following lemma may be viewed as generalizations of the Bayes theorem to the
inﬁnite-dimensional setting [38].
Lemma 4.1. If G : X → RJ is µ0-measurable and the normalization constant

(cid:90)

Z(y) =

exp(−Φ(x; y))µ0(dx) > 0

for y N (0, Γ)-a.s., then the posterior measure µy is absolutely continuous with re-
spect to the prior measure µ0 and has the Randon-Nikodym derivative as follows:

X

dµ0

(x) =

Z(y)

exp(−Φ(x; y)).

(4.3)

Lemma 4.2. Consider a measure µy which is absolutely continuous with respect
to a measure µ0 with Randon-Nikodym derivative given by (4.3). Let assumption
2 hold and assume that the prior measure µ0 is a Gaussian measure N (m,C) and
that µ0(X) = 1. Then the measure µy is Lipschitz in the data y, with respect to the

Hellinger distance: if µy and µy(cid:48)
y(cid:48) then there is C = C(r) > 0 such that, for all y, y(cid:48) with max{|y|,|y(cid:48)|} ≤ r,

are two measures given by (4.3) with data y and

dHell(µy, µy(cid:48)

) ≤ C|y − y(cid:48)|.

Consequently all polynomially bounded functions of x ∈ X are continuous in y. In
particular the mean and covariance operator are continuous in y.

operators related to the covariance.

In the Bayesian inverse theory, we also need the following assumptions about
Assumption 3: The operator A, densely deﬁned on the Hilbert space H =

L2(BR; Rn), satisﬁes the following properties:

(1) A is positive-deﬁnite, self-adjoint and invertible;
(2) the eigenfunctions {φj}j∈N of A, form an orthonormal basis for H;
(3) there are C± > 0 such that the eigenvalues satisfy αj ≈ j2/n, for all j ∈ N;
(4) there is C > 0 such that

There are lots of studies about the inﬁnite-dimensional Bayesian approach. For
more references about the Bayesian approach in inﬁnite-dimensions, we refer to
[39, 41, 42, 43].
4.1.2. Applied to Fractional Inverse Scattering Problem. Let BR ⊂ R2 be the ball
mentioned in section 3.1. We set X = Cu(BR), deﬁne V := H 1(BR). Let (cid:96)j with
j = 1, 2,··· , J are linear functionals on V , that means (cid:96)j ∈ V ∗ where V ∗ is the
dual space of V . Deﬁne

(4.4)
and as in section 3.1, we denote us(x) = S(e˜q − 1)uinc. According to Theorem 3.5,
we may know that us ∈ H 1(BR). Hence, in our setting, the unknown function x
should be function ˜q and the observation operator could be deﬁned as follows:

˜q(x) := log(1 + q(x)),

G(˜q) = {Gj(˜q)}J

j=1 := {(cid:96)j(S(e˜q − 1)uinc)}J

j=1.

(4.5)
We take a prior on ˜q to be the measure N (0, A−s) with s > 1 where A is an operator
satisfy assumption 3 with n = 1. From the Theorem 2.18 in [37], we obtain that
µ0(X) = 1.
Denote Q0 = N (0, Γ), Q˜q = N (G(˜q), Γ). Taking B1 as a unit ball in X. Since
(4.6)
and η ∼ N (0, Γ), noting that y is Q0-a.s. ﬁnite, we have for some M = M (y) < ∞

|G(˜q)| ≤ (cid:107)S(e˜q − 1)uinc(cid:107)H 1 ≤ C < ∞,

Denote Z as in lemma 4.1, by Theorem 6.28 in [38], we know that
exp(−M )µ0(d˜q) = exp(−M )µ0(B1) > 0.

Thus, by Lemma 4.1, we obtain

(4.7)

Considering (4.6) and Theorem 3.6, we easily veriﬁed that Φ in (4.7) satisﬁes as-
sumption 2. Hence, we actually proved the following theorem.

Theorem 4.3. For the two-dimensional fractional scattering problem concerned
with loss-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation (problem (4.1) with G given by
(4.5)), if we assume ˜q = log(1 + q) ∼ µ0 where µ0 = N (0, A−s) with s > 1. In
addition, we assume η ∈ RJ , η ∼ Q0 where Q0 = N (0, Γ). Then the posterior mea-
sure µy exists and absolutely continuous with µ0 with Randon-Nikodym derivative
given by

(4.8)

In addition, the measure µy is Lipschitz in the data y, with respect to the Hellinger
distance.

4.2. Bayesian Approximation Error Approach for Functions. Bayesian in-
verse theory mentioned in the above section 4.1 give a general framework for inverse
problems. There is an assumption in the theory that is η is independent to x. How-
ever, this is not always true if there are some model reduction errors. Hence, in this
section, we allow a part of the noise depend on x and construct the mathematical
framework in this new setting.

4.2.1. General Theory. Let X, Y be separable Hilbert space, equipped with the
Borel σ-algebra, and G : X → Y a measurable mapping. We wish to solve the
inverse problem of ﬁnding x from y where

y = G(x) +  + η,

(4.9)
and η ∈ Y denotes noise,  denotes model reduction error. We employ a Bayesian
approach to this problem in which we let (x, y) ∈ X × Y be a random variable and
compute x|y. We specify the random variable (x, y) as follows:

¯x and covariance operator Cx ∈ L+

• Prior: x ∼ µ0 measure on X and µ0 is chosen to be a Gaussian with mean
• Noise: η ∼ Q0 = N (0,Cη) measure on Y with Cx ∈ L+
• Model Reduction Error:  ∼ R¯ = N (¯,C) measure on Y with C ∈

1 (Y ), and η ⊥ x.

1 (X).

1 (Y ), and η ⊥ .
L+

Usually we can not assume  ⊥ x, hence, we assume (, x) ∈ H := Y × X

distributed according to a Gaussian measure N ((¯, ¯x),C). Denote
C = E( − ¯) ⊗ ( − ¯),
Cx = E( − ¯) ⊗ (x − ¯x).

Cx = E(x − ¯x) ⊗ (x − ¯x),
Cx = E(x − ¯x) ⊗ ( − ¯),

FRACTIONAL SCATTERING PROBLEM

21

According to Theorem 6.20 in [39] (the results may also be found in early study
[16]), we ﬁnd that |x ∼ N (¯x,C|x) where

¯x = ¯ + CxC−1
C|x = C − CxC−1

x (x − ¯x),
x Cx.

ν =  + η,

ν|x = |x + η,

Deﬁne

then we have

and ν|x ∼ N (¯νx,Cν|x) where

Thus, we obtain that

¯νx = ¯ + CxC−1
x (x − ¯x),
Cν|x = Cη + C − CxC−1

x Cx.

y|x ∼ ˜Q := N (G(x) + ¯νx,Cν|x).

(4.10)

(4.11)

We assume through out the following that ˜Q (cid:28) Q0 for x µ0-a.s. Thus, for some
potential Φ : X × Y → R,

d ˜Q
dQ0

(y) =

Z(y)

exp(−Φ(x; y)).

(4.12)

Thus, for ﬁxed x, Φ(x;·) : Y → R is measurable.

Deﬁne ς0 to be the product measure

ς0(dx, dy) = µ0(dx)Q0(dy).

(4.13)
We assume in what follows that Φ(·,·) is ς0 measurable. Then the random variable
(x, y) is distributed according to measure ς(dx, dy) = µ0(dx) ˜Q(dy). Furthermore,
it then follows that ς (cid:28) ς0 with

dς
dς0

(x, y) =

exp(−Φ(x; y)).

(4.14)

Then we have the following theorem analogue of Lemma 4.1.

Proof. Because the measure Q0 and the measure ˜Q are both Gaussian measure,
from Feldman-Hajek theorem [46], we can conclude that under conditions (1) to
(3), ˜Q (cid:28) Q0. From ˜Q (cid:28) Q0, we notice that Φ exists. Note that the positive of Z
holds for y ς0-almost surely, and hence by absolute continuity of ς with respect to
(cid:3)
ς0, for y ς almost surely. Now by Theorem 6.29 in [39], the results follows.
In the sequel, we consider a simple case that is the operator Cη and Cν|x commute
with each other. Because Cη and Cν|x commute, there exists a complete orthonormal
system (ek) in Y , and sequences (λk), (rk) of positive numbers such that

Cηek = λkek,

Cν|xek = rkek,

(4.17)
In order to provide a clear veriﬁcation, we denote h = G(x) + ¯νx, hence, we have

˜Q = N (h,Cν|x) and h =(cid:80)∞

k=1 hkek with hk = (h, ek).

k ∈ N.

N (0, λk), N (h,Cν|x) =

1 (Y ) be such that [Cη,Cν|x] := CηCν|x −

4.2.2. Applied to Fractional Inverse Scattering Problem. For the fractional Helmholtz
equation, we usually need to calculate it by adding some artiﬁcial boundary con-
ditions, e.g., absorbing boundary conditions or perfect matched layer methods. In
the sequel, we will analyze absorbing boundary conditions with form

(4.21)
where D ⊂ Rn is a bounded Lipschitz domain. With this boundary condition, our
problem becomes

on ∂D,

∂nus = ikus

∆us + iωτ ALus + k2(1 + q)us = (−k2q − iωτ k2γ+1)uinc
∂nus = ikus,

on ∂D,

in D

(4.22)

(cid:40)

where supp(q) ⊂ D. As in section 3.1, we denote us = Sa(q)uinc. The operator
Sa and the operator S will be similar if the domain D is large enough. For
the operator Sa, Theorem 3.3, Theorem 3.5 and Theorem 3.6 can be established
similarly. Denote ˜ = Sa(q)uinc − S(q)uinc, then ˜ means the system reduction
error brought by the absorbing boundary condition.
Similar to section 4.1.2, deﬁne V := H 1(D). Let (cid:96)j with j = 1, 2,··· , J are linear
functionals on V , that means (cid:96)j ∈ V ∗ where V ∗ is the dual space of V . Deﬁne

then the forward operator will be deﬁned as follows:

˜q(x) := log(1 + q(x)),

G(˜q) = {Gj(˜q)}J

j=1 := {(cid:96)j(Sa(e˜q − 1)uinc)}J

j=1.

The system reduction error can also be deﬁned

 = {(cid:96)j(˜)}J

j=1 = {(cid:96)j(Sa(q)uinc − S(q)uinc)}J

j=1.

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

Based on these considerations, our model can be presented as follows:

y = G(˜q) +  + η,

(4.26)
where , η ∈ RJ . In our setting, the covariance operator Cη and Cν|˜q (in our setting
we change x to ˜q) are symmetric matrix. Hence, we could obtain the following form
of potential Φ

Φ(˜q; y) =

Taking s > 0 is a small positive number, µ0 = N (0, A−2(s+1)) and X = H 1+s(D),
then by Lemma 6.27 in [39] we can conclude that µ0(X) = 1 if A satisﬁes assumption

Theorem 4.7. For the two-dimensional fractional scattering problem concerned
with loss-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation with absorbing boundary condi-
tion (problem (4.22) with G given by (4.24)), if we assume ˜q = log(1 + q) ∼ µ0
where µ0 = N (0, A−2(s+1)) with s > 0. In addition, we assume η ∈ RJ , η ∼ Q0
where Q0 = N (0,Cη), (, ˜q) ∈ H := RJ × H 1+s(D) distributed according to a
Gaussian measure N ((¯, 0),C). Denote ν and ν|˜q have same meaning with (4.10)
and (4.11). Then the posterior measure µy exists and absolutely continuous with
µ0 with Randon-Nikodym derivative given by

In addition, the measure µy is Lipschitz in the data y, with respect to the Hellinger
distance.
Proof. To conclude the proof of this theorem, we need to check Z > 0 Q0-a.s. and
Φ deﬁned in (4.28) satisfy assumption 2. For the former one, notice that

|G(˜q)| ≤ (cid:107)Sa(˜q)(cid:107)H 1(D) ≤ C < ∞,

where C depend on (cid:107)˜q(cid:107)L∞(D) which could be bounded by (cid:107)˜q(cid:107)H 1+s(D). Because
η ∼ N (0,Cη), notice that y is Q0-a.s. ﬁnite, we have for some M = M (y) < ∞

|C−1/2

Hence, by the Theorem 6.28 in [38], we know that

exp(−M )µ0(d˜q) = exp(−M )µ0(B1) > 0.

B1

To check Φ deﬁned in (4.28) satisfy assumption 2, we should notice the following
fact

(cid:107)Sa(˜q1) − Sa(˜q2)(cid:107)H 1(D) ≤ C(cid:107)˜q1 − ˜q2(cid:107)L∞(D) ≤ C(cid:107)˜q1 − ˜q2(cid:107)H 1+s(D),

(4.29)

which can be veriﬁed easily by using similar methods in proving Theorem 3.6.
Considering (4.29), assumption 2 can be veriﬁed by simple calculations. Hence, the
(cid:3)
proof is completed.

Remark 4.8. Here we provide a simple example which only incorporate model re-
duction error induced by the absorbing boundary condition. Using similar method,
we may incorporate some other kinds of model reduction error, e.g., ﬁnite element
approximation. Our theory provides an inﬁnite-dimensional Bayesian approxima-
tion error approach. The assumption about  seems unreasonable, however, in the
discrete case, there is also no other choices except Gaussian. Hence, at present,
it may be unreachable to develop a theory for a non-Gaussian measure in inﬁnite-
dimension.

5. Conclusion

In the ﬁrst part of this article, we provide a fractional Helmholtz equation, then
formulate two scattering problems: one is related to the loss-dominated fractional
Helmholtz equation, another one is related to the dispersion-dominated fractional
Helmholtz equation. For the former one, a well-posedness theory has been estab-
lished for general wavenumber k > 0 and the Lipschitz continuity of the solution
with respect to the scatterer has also been proved. For the later one, because
the problem seems too complex, we only provide a well-posedness theory for suﬃ-
ciently small wavenumber. For the general wavenumber, the problem needs further
investigations and it may be related to the studies on regularity properties about
fractional elliptic systems.

In the second part of this article, we consider fractional inverse scattering prob-
lem related to the loss-dominated fractional Helmholtz equation. A well-posedness
(in the sense of Bayesian statistics) result has been constructed under Gaussian
prior assumption. Actually, there seems no conceptional diﬃculties to construct a
well-posedness theory under a variable Besov prior assumption proposed in a re-
cent article [50]. We provide an inﬁnite-dimensional Bayesian approximate error
approach which incorporates model reduction error explicitly. Inﬁnite-dimensional
version of Bayesian approximate error approach generalizes the traditional inﬁnite-
dimensional Bayesian inverse theory to allow a part of the noise depend on the
target function (the function needs to be estimated). Finally, we apply our theory
to the fractional inverse scattering problem related to the loss-dominated fractional
Helmholtz equation and provide a well-posedness result in the sense of Bayesian
statistics.
