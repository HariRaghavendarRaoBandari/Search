We review recent progress in the application of numerical relativity techniques to astro-
physics and high-energy physics. We focus on some developments that took place within
the “Numerical Relativity and High Energy Physics” network, a Marie Curie IRSES ac-
tion that we coordinated, namely: spin evolution in black hole binaries, high-energy black
hole collisions, compact object solutions in scalar-tensor gravity, superradiant instabil-
ities and hairy black hole solutions in Einstein’s gravity coupled to fundamental ﬁelds,
and the possibility to gain insight into these phenomena using analog gravity models.

1. Introduction

The last global meeting of the Numerical Relativity and High Energy Physics net-
work – a Marie Curie IRSES (International Research Staﬀ Exchange Scheme) part-
nership (2012-2015) funded by the European Union and coordinated by the authors
of this paper – started in Bel´em (Brazil) on September 28, 2015. Everyone in atten-
dance, as well as the large majority of the scientiﬁc community, was unaware that a
major breakthrough in science had just taken place: precisely two weeks earlier, the
LIGO/Virgo collaboration observed the ﬁrst gravitational-wave (GW) signal from
the merger of two black holes (BHs).1

The detection relied on decades of technological eﬀorts to perform an appar-
ently impossible measurement, corresponding to displacements that are ∼ 103 times
smaller than the atomic nucleus. The unambiguous interpretation of the signal ob-
served by Advanced LIGO as a BH binary coalescence was also the result of a
decades-long eﬀort: it took over 40 years to numerically solve Einstein’ equations of
general relativity (GR) and to understand the behavior BH binaries through their
inspiral, merger and ringdown.

A toolbox of powerful techniques became available after the tremendous nu-
merical relativity breakthrough that took place in 2005.2–4 This naturally led to a
community eﬀort looking for applications of these tools beyond astrophysics5 and
eventually to this network, that looked at applications of numerical relativity both
in astrophysics6 and beyond.7

This paper is a summary of some of the science produced within the network.
As such it is admittedly biased and incomplete, and it certainly does not aim to be
a comprehensive review of the impressive developments in the area of numerical rel-
ativity and high-energy physics that took place over the past few years. The plan of
the paper is as follows. We will start in Section 2 by considering BH collisions, ﬁrst
in astrophysics (paying particular attention to some recent developments concerning
spin dynamics), and then in the context of fundamental and high-energy physics
(with applications to large extra dimension scenarios and to the gauge gravity du-
ality). In Section 3 we will look at compact objects – i.e., BHs and neutron stars
(NSs) – in alternative theories of gravity, focusing on models with scalar degrees of
freedom in the gravitational sector: tensor-(multi)-scalar theories, Horndeski gravity
and Eistein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In Section 4 we will consider GR mini-
mally coupled to fundamental scalar and tensor ﬁelds and present some remarkable
results obtained in the last few years in these simple models, including new types
of numerical BH solutions that deﬁed common lore. The existence of these BHs
with scalar or Proca hair is intimately related with the complex phenomenon of
superradiance, that can occur for rotating and charged BHs. Numerical relativity
techniques have been (and will be) instrumental in probing the dynamics of these
objects. Section 5 looks at many of these phenomena (in particular those discussed
in Section 4) from a diﬀerent perspective: that of analog gravity models. We close
with some brief remarks.

2. Black hole collisions: numerical and analytical studies

Collisions of BHs have been modeled using analytic and numerical techniques for
several decades. One of the main motivations throughout this time has been the
signiﬁcance of merging BH binary systems as one of the strongest sources for direct
detection of GWs. The recent breakthrough detection by Advanced LIGO of the
event called GW1509141 indeed observed the late stages of a BH binary inspiral,
including merger and ringdown. This event clearly marks a revolution in our ob-
servational studies of the Universe. Astrophysical BH binary mergers form a key
motivation for the work reviewed here. Additionally to this new era in gravitational
astrophysics, many developments in theoretical physics, particularly during the past
two decades, add substantial motivation to the modeling of BH collisions from other
angles,7, 8 and make BHs one of the centre-stage actors in contemporary physics.

A BH is the closest analog in GR to the concept of a point mass in Newto-
nian physics, and spacetimes containing two BHs represent the simplest version
of the two-body problem in GR. Unlike their Newtonian counterparts, however,
binary BH spacetimes have substantially more complex dynamics: BHs have “in-
ternal structure” in the form of spin, and their interaction in a binary leads to GW
emission. Therefore it should come as no surprise that these spacetimes cannot be
described by exact solutions in closed analytic form, analogous to the Keplerian
orbits in Newtonian physics. For this reason most theoretical modeling resorts to
approximation methods, such as post-Newtonian theory,9 perturbation theory10 or
the point-particle approximation.11 In alternative to these approaches, which ap-
proximate the theory, numerical relativity generates solutions to the full non-linear
equations, approximating them via some form of discretization.12–14 The decades-
long eﬀorts of numerical relativity culminated in the 2005 breakthroughs performing
the ﬁrst evolutions of binary BHs through inspiral, merger and ringdown;2–4 for a
historical perspective on this milestone see, e.g., Ref. 15.

The contemporary modeling of BH collisions in the context of astrophysics, GW
physics and high-energy physics relies on a combination of all these analytic and
numerical methods. The purpose of this section is to review some of the most recent
and exciting developments.

2.1. Astrophysical black holes and gravitational waves

The modeling of BH binaries as astrophysical sources of GWs has mostly focussed
on systems in quasi-circular orbits because the emission of GWs rapidly carries away
excess angular momentum from the binary.16 By the time a binary has reached the
frequency window of GW detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo,
the orbital eccentricity is very close to zero. This eﬃcient elimination of eccentricity
relies, of course, on the absence of any signiﬁcant interaction with matter or third
bodies. The possible eﬀects of non-vanishing eccentricity have been investigated
by several analytical and numerical studies.17–26 Quasicircular inspirals remain the
most likely and best understood scenario, so here we shall concentrate on this case.

We will also focus on binaries in the framework of GR, but we note that there
are preliminary explorations of scalar radiation from BH binaries in scalar-tensor
theory, triggered either by non asymptotically ﬂat boundary conditions27 or by a
non-vanishing potential.28

The estimation of source parameters in GW observations employs a method
called matched ﬁltering where the data stream is compared with a catalog of theo-
retically predicted GW templates;29 for an application of this technique to hybrid
waveforms constructed out of numerical relativity and PN calculations see for exam-
ple Ref. 30. A main challenge for the theoretical community is the generation of such
template catalogs covering with high accuracy the whole range of BH binary masses
and spins. Given the high computational cost of numerical relativity simulations,
this construction typically stitches together post-Newtonian and numerical relativ-
ity waveforms,31–33 or employs numerical simulations to calibrate free parameters
in analytic prescriptions such as the eﬀective-one-body model.34–37

BH binaries with generic spins will undergo spin precession during which the or-
bital plane changes orientation. The modeling of these systems is signiﬁcantly more
involved than that of their nonprecessing counterparts, but beneﬁts enormously
from the presence of three distinctly diﬀerent timescales. If we denote by r the sep-
aration of the two constituent BHs, these orbit around each other on the orbital
timescale torb ∝ r3/2, while the spin directions change on the precession timescale
tpre ∝ r5/2, and the emission of GWs reduces the separation r on the radiation reac-
tion timescale tRR ∝ r4. At suﬃciently large separation r, this implies the hierarchy
torb (cid:28) tpre (cid:28) tRR. The ﬁrst inequality has been used to derive orbit-averaged evolu-
tion equations for the individual spin vectors Si (i = 1, 2) of the from ˙Si = Ωi×Si,
where the precession frequency depends on the orbital angular momentum L and
the Si, but not on the separation vector r.38–40 This quasiadiabatic approach has
been combined with some additional simpliﬁcations for the precession dynamics in
order to construct template banks for precessing binaries. These techniques include
a single eﬀective spin model, modiﬁcations to the stationary-phase approximation,
or the use of nonprecessing templates modulated through an eﬀective precession
parameter.41–46 Orbit-averaged PN calculations have also been employed in the dis-
covery of spin-orbit resonances47 and for predictions of the ﬁnal spins and recoil in
BH binary mergers.48–50

The success of the orbit-averaging procedure relies heavily on the analytic so-
lutions for Keplerian orbits that are employed in the averaging over the orbital
timescale. Until recently, no analogous analytic solution was known for the preces-
sion equations, so that the second inequality of the above hierarchy, torb (cid:28) tRR, has
not been brought to the same level of fruition. This picture changed with the iden-
tiﬁcation of analytic solutions on the precessional timescale.51, 52 Consider for this
purpose a BH binary with orbital angular momentum L, individual masses mi and
spin vectors Si, i = 1, 2 and mass ratio q = m2/m1 ≤ 1. For ﬁxed mass ratio, the
system is described by nine parameters, three each for S1, S2 and L. Conservation
of the spin magnitudes Si reduces this number to seven. On the precession timescale,

March 22, 2016 0:27 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

the total angular momentum J ≡ S1 + S2 + L as well as the magnitude L are also
conserved at the PN orders considered here, leaving three numbers to determine the
state of the binary. A convenient choice for these variables is given by the angles
θi between the individual spins and the orbital angular momentum vector and the
angle ∆Φ between the projections of the individual spins onto the orbital plane: cf.
e.g. Fig. 1 in Ref. 52. One further variable can be eliminated through a convenient
choice of a non-inertial frame. Finally, the projected eﬀective spin deﬁned by53, 54

ξ ≡ (m1 + m2)

−2[(1 + q)S1 + (1 + q

−1)S2] · L/L ,

(1)

is conserved by the orbit-averaged spin-precession equations at 2PN order, and even
under radiation reaction at 2.5PN order. Spin precession at this order is therefore
described in terms of a single evolution variable, conveniently chosen to be the
magnitude of the total spin S ≡ |S1 + S2|.

For a BH binary with speciﬁed parameters and separation, i.e. ﬁxed values
mi, Si, L, J, ξ, the precession is described completely in terms of the variable S.
The set of physically allowed systems can then be represented as the area inside a
closed loop constructed from two “eﬀective potentials” ξ±(S) in the (S, ξ) plane.
The functions ξ±(S) are determined by the physical constraints on the spin and
angular momenta

Smin = max(|J − L|, |S1 − S2|) ,

Jmin = max(0, L − S1 − S2, |S1 − S2| − L) ,

Smax = min(J + L, S1 + S2) ,(2)

Jmax = L + S1 + S2 ,

(3)

and are given in closed analytic form by Eq. (14) in Ref. 52. For a given value of
ξ inside the range compatible with these constraints, this implies that S oscillates
between two extrema S±, where Smin ≤ S− ≤ S+ ≤ Smax
a. All remaining variables
of the binary can be obtained from S through Eqs. (20) in Ref. 52 for θ1, θ2 and
∆Φ which, in turn, determine all other physical variables.

A particularly intriguing consequence of this formulation of the spin precession
dynamics is that all binaries fall into one of three morphologies, which are best
characterized by the behavior of the angle ∆Φ on the precession time scale. As
the variable S oscillates inside its allowed range, ∆Φ either (i) librates around 0,
(ii) librates around π, or (iii) circulates through the entire range ∆Φ ∈ [−π, π].
As the binary inspirals on the much larger radiation reaction timescale, the orbital
and total angular momentum evolve, and the binary may undergo phase transitions
between these morphologies. The inspiral of the binary under GW emission can be
modeled in a remarkably eﬃcient manner at 1PN order if we express the binary
separation r in terms of the orbital angular momentum L given by the Newtonian
expression L = η(rM 3)1/2, where M ≡ m1 + m2 and η ≡ m1m2/(m1 + m2) is the
symmetric mass ratio parameter. The evolution of the total angular momentum J

aThe resonance conﬁgurations of Ref. 47 correspond to the maximal and minimal allowed values of
ξ in this area, ξmax and ξmin, at which S− = S+ and, hence, S remains constant on the precession
timescale; cf. Fig. 2 in Ref. 52.

The evolution of precessing BH binaries is thus modeled in terms of a single ordi-
nary diﬀerential equation (4) which, thanks to the precession-averaging procedure,
can furthermore be solved numerically using much larger timesteps than possible
in a formulation using only orbit-averaged variables. By suitably compactifying the
variables involved, accurate numerical evolutions from inﬁnite separations become
possible at drastically reduced computational cost. The formalism truly bridges the
gap between astrophysical BH separations and the regime close to merger, where
numerical relativity predictions for BH kicks are valid. Further applications of the
formalism identiﬁed a precessional instability of binaries where the spin of the more
(less) massive BH is (anti) aligned with the orbital angular momentum,55 and high-
lighted how the precessional morphology may carry a memory of the astrophysical
processes that formed the binary.52, 56 Preliminary studies of the potential of present
and future GW detectors to determine the morphologies in BH observations are
encouraging, except for highly symmetric binaries, where precessional eﬀects are
suppressed.57, 58

2.2. Black hole collisions, fundamental and high-energy physics

Even 100 years after its publication, GR still confronts us with some of the most
important questions in contemporary physics. As described below in Sec. 4, astro-
physical and cosmological observations suggest the presence of an enigmatic dark
sector which appears to dominate the gravitational dynamics of much of our uni-
verse. At an even more fundamental level, GR predicts the limits of its own range
of validity. Seminal work by Hawking and Penrose59–61 demonstrated that gravita-
tional collapse in the framework of GR leads to singularities under generic initial
conditions. The appearance of inﬁnities in the theory is expected to be cured by a
future quantum theory of gravitation. Quite remarkably, however, relativity appears
to have a built-in protection mechanism against the potentially fatal consequences
of spacetime singularities; according to Penrose’s cosmic censorship conjecture,62
the singularities do not appear in naked form for physically realistic, generic initial
data, but instead are cloaked inside horizons which causally disconnect the exte-
rior spacetime from being inﬂuenced by the singularity. According to Thorne’s hoop
conjecture,63 such horizons should furthermore form (in D = 4 spacetime dimen-
sions) whenever a physical system of mass M gets compacted inside a region with

March 22, 2016 0:27 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

8 Berti, Cardoso, Crispino, Gualtieri, Herdeiro, Sperhake

circumference (cid:46) 2πRs, where Rs = 2M is the Schwarzschild radius associated with
M . The conjecture has also been generalized to higher dimensions.64

A particularly intriguing consequence arising from the hoop conjecture is the
possibility of BH formation in proton-proton collisions at colliders such as the LHC,
or in cosmic-ray showers hitting the Earth’s atmosphere. In the trans-Planckian
regime, where the colliding partons can be approximated as classical particles, the
hoop conjecture predicts formation of a BH if the boost parameter γ satisﬁes γ (cid:38)
c4R/(4Gm0), i.e. if two particles of rest mass m0 with center-of-mass energy M =
2γm0 get compacted inside a volume of radius ∼ R. Taking the radius to be given
by the de Broglie wavelength hc/M associated with the center-of-mass energy, the
condition for BH formation becomes65 (up to factors of order unity) M (cid:38) EP =

(cid:112)c5/G, i.e. the center-of-mass energy of the collision must exceed the Planck

energy. At the four-dimensional standard-model value Ep ∼ 1019 GeV, experimental
tests of BH formation are clearly out of the range of present and forseeable colliders.
The so-called TeV gravity scenarios involving large or warped extra dimensions,66–69
however, provide an appealing explanation of the hierarchy problem of physics and
may lower the eﬀective Planck energy to values as low as the TeV regime, which
would allow for the possibility to form BHs in particle collisions at the LHC.70, 71
Simulations of BH collisions can provide important information about the cross
section and energy loss through GWs which form key input for the Monte-Carlo
generators employed in the analysis of experimental data.70, 72

Yet another rich area of applying BH studies has emerged in the context of the
gauge-gravity duality, often also referred to as the AdS/CFT correspondence,73–75
which states the equivalence between string theory in asymptotically AdS space-
times (times a compact space) and conformal ﬁeld theories living on the AdS bound-
ary. The duality provides a new approach to the (notoriously diﬃcult) modeling of
physical systems in strongly coupled gauge theories in terms of classical spacetimes,
often involving BHs, that are one dimension higher and asymptote to AdS at inﬁnite
radius.

In the following we will review some of the recent developments in BH modeling
in the context of these topics, but we note that there are several more comprehensive
reviews on these subjects.5, 7, 76, 77

The hoop conjecture has been tested in the context of high-speed collisions of
scalar-ﬁeld65 and ﬂuid-ball conﬁgurations.78, 79 In all these simulations, BH for-
mation is observed at high velocities, consistent with the prediction of the hoop
conjecture. Combined with the fact that in high-energy collisions most of the center-
of-mass energy is present in the form of kinetic energy, the hoop conjecture supports
the idea that parton-parton collisions can be well modeled by colliding BHs, the GR
analog of point particles. High-energy collisions have been studied most comprehen-
sively in D = 4 spacetime dimensions and revealed a number of intriguing features.
Numerical simulations of equal-mass, non-spinning BHs colliding head-on predict80
that in the ultrarelativistic limit a fraction of 14 ± 3% (recently conﬁrmed and re-

ﬁned to 13 ± 1% by the RIT group81) of the total energy is radiated in GWs. This
value is about half of Penrose’s upper limit,82, 83 and in good agreement with the
value of 16.4% obtained in second-order perturbative calculations on a background
composed of two superposed Aichelburg-Sexl shock waves.84–92

In grazing collisions the BHs are allowed to approach each other with a non-
zero impact parameter b, and the outcome of the collision depends on whether this
parameter exceeds a threshold value or not. This scattering threshold bscat separates
conﬁgurations that result in the formation of a single BH (b < bscat) or in the
constituents scattering oﬀ each other to inﬁnity (b > bscat), and was shown to be
approximately given as a function of the collision speed v and the center-of-mass
energy M c2 by the remarkably simple formula 93

bscat ≈ 2.5

.

(7)

Numerical simulations94 furthermore identiﬁed the presence of zoom-whirl orbits95
in a regime where b is close to a critical value b∗ (cid:46) bscat. The energy released in GWs
in these grazing collisions can be enormous, exceeding 35% of the total energy. Ex-
trapolation to the speed of light, however, demonstrates that the maximum energy
saturates at about half of the total (i.e. kinetic) energy.96 The remaining kinetic en-
ergy, instead, ends up as rest mass, either in the single BH resulting from merger or
in the two constituents in scattering conﬁgurations. Simulations of rotating BHs96
also demonstrate that the impact of the spin on the collision dynamics is washed out
in the limit v → c. We ﬁnd here another conﬁrmation of the “matter does not mat-
ter” conjecture already encountered in scalar-ﬁeld and ﬂuid-ball collisions:65, 78, 79
ultrarelativistic collisions are dominated by the kinetic energy, so that the internal
structure of the colliding objects becomes irrelevant for the collision process. Fur-
ther evidence for this conjecture has recently been obtained in numerical studies of
unequal-mass BH collisions. Head-on collisions of this type emit ∼ 13% of the total
mass in the form of GWs in the ultrarelativistic limit, in excellent agreement with
the equal-mass result mentioned above.97

It remains to be seen whether this picture remains intact as electric charge is
added to the colliding particles. Collisions of electrically charged BHs have so far
considered only the low-velocity regime, and revealed qualitatively similar dynamics
as for the case of neutral BHs.98 As intuitively expected, however, the collision is
slowed down in the case of equal electric charges, reducing the energy radiated in
electromagnetic and GWs as the charge-to-mass ratio approaches the critical value
Q/M = 1. Conversely, the collision is accelerated by the additional attractive force
between the BHs if they carry opposite charges, which increases the GW radiation
by a factor of ∼ 2.7 as the charge-to-mass ratio |Q|/M increases from 0 to 0.99 .99
The electromagnetic radiation becomes dominant in these collisions at |Q|/M ∼ 0.37
and exceeds its GW counterpart by a factor ∼ 5.8 when |Q|/M = 0.99.
The high-energy collision of particles has also attracted considerable interest
in a more astrophysical context through the collisional Penrose process.100 Particle

collisions near rapidly rotating BHs could in principle lead to arbitrarily large center-
of-mass energies,101 but there are several caveats on the astrophysical viability of
this process.102–104 The signiﬁcance of such collisions is limited, in particular, by the
redshift experienced by particles escaping from the near-horizon area to observers
far away from the source.105, 106 An interesting possibility is that one of the colliding
particles could have outgoing radial momentum: this can happen either because the
particle reaches a turning point in the orbit,107 or by allowing at least one outgoing
particle to be generated close to the BH via previous collisions.108 In both cases the
eﬃciency of the process (i.e., the ratio of the escaping particle’s energy to the sum
of the pre-collision particles’ energies) can reach values as large as ∼ 13.9.109, 110
Collisions of BHs in D > 4 spacetime dimensions are not as well understood
as the D = 4 case, mostly because of diﬃculties arising in the numerical stability
of the simulations. The most extensive exploration of BH collisions in D = 5 was
able to determine the scattering threshold in grazing collisions at velocities up to
v ≈ 0.6 c.111 This study used the so-called modiﬁed Cartoon method 112–116 and iden-
tiﬁed regions of exceptionally high curvature above the Planck regime that are not
hidden inside a BH horizon. These regions with curvature radius below the Planck
length are realized during the close encounter of two BHs in scattering conﬁgura-
tions. The emission of GWs in D = 5 has been analyzed in head-on collisions of
non-spinning BHs starting from rest.117, 118 It predicts Erad/M = (0.089 ± 0.006)%
for equal masses and a monotonic decrease, in good agreement with point par-
ticle approximations, as the mass ratio is lowered from q = 1 to smaller values.
The numerical method of this work is based on a dimensional reduction by isom-
etry,119 analogous to the Geroch decomposition.120 Results from the two diﬀerent
codes have been compared in D = 5, demonstrating excellent agreement .121 This
work also provided the ﬁrst estimate in D = 6, where equal-mass head-on collisions
yield Erad/M = (0.081 ± 0.004)%. All these studies assume rotational symmetry in
planes involving the extra dimensions such that the eﬀective computational domain
remains three dimensional. These symmetry assumptions still accomodate most of
the scenarios relevant in the context of testing TeV gravity or fundamental proper-
ties of BH spacetimes.

Perturbative calculations based on superposed shock waves have also been ex-
tended to D ≥ 5 dimensions, including non-zero impact parameters.83, 122, 123 These
calculations predict a signiﬁcant increase of the threshold impact parameter for for-
mation of a common apparent horizon relative to the four-dimensional case; see, in
particular, Table II in Ref. 123. Extension of the work by d’Eath and Payne for the
head-on case to D ≥ 5 resulted in a remarkably simple expression at ﬁrst perturba-
tive order for the energy fraction radiated in GWs:87, 88 Erad/M = 1/2− 1/D. This
result, originally obtained in a numerical study, has more recently been conﬁrmed
analytically to be exact at ﬁrst order.91

The modeling of shock-wave and BH collisions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes
is signiﬁcantly complicated by the active role and the complex structure of the
outer boundary: see Refs. 124, 125 for a discussion of numerical methods. Over the

past decade, substantial progress has been made in overcoming these diﬃculties,
achieving the ﬁrst collision of BHs in an asymptotically AdS spacetime126 (see
also Ref. 127 for an earlier toy model). Numerical simulations of shock waves and
BHs have clearly demonstrated their capacity for obtaining new insight into the
strongly coupled regime of gauge theories. These studies have addressed in particular
the thermalization of quark-gluon plasma in the heavy-ion collisions performed for
example at the Brookhaven RHIC collider. Estimates for the thermalization time
obtained through the AdS/CFT correspondence are ∼ 0.35 fm/c, in good agreement
with experimental data.128–130 As in the asymptotically ﬂat case, point-particle and
perturbative calculations provide a convenient tool complementing full numerical
relativity studies.131, 132 For a more extended discussion of BH and shock wave
collisions in AdS, we refer the reader to Ref. 7.

Finally, we remark that BH collisions in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes
have been considered as tests of the cosmic censorship conjecture. The numerical
simulations support the conjecture.133

3. Compact objects in modiﬁed theories of gravity

In this section we will discuss isolated compact objects (BHs and NSs) in modiﬁed
theories of gravity. We will focus on one of the most natural and best studied exten-
sions of GR: scalar-tensor gravity, in which one or more scalar degrees of freedom
are included in the gravitational sector through a nonminimal coupling.134–139

We will discuss compact objects in these theories at increasing levels of com-
plexity, starting from the “standard” Bergmann-Wagoner formulation (Section 3.1)
and then considering extensions to multiple scalar ﬁelds (Section 3.2), Horndeski
gravity (Section 3.3) and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (Section 3.4).

3.1. “Bergmann-Wagoner” scalar-tensor theories

The most general action of scalar-tensor gravity, at most quadratic in derivatives of
the ﬁelds and with one scalar ﬁeld, was studied by Bergmann and Wagoner.140, 141
The action of this theory can be written (with an appropriate ﬁeld redeﬁnition) as:

(cid:20)

(cid:21)
gµν∂µφ ∂νφ − U (φ)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

S =

16π

d4x√−g

φR −

ω(φ)

φ

+ SM [Ψ, gµν] ,

(8)

where U (φ) and ω(φ) are arbitrary functions of the scalar ﬁeld φ, and SM is the
action of the matter ﬁelds Ψ. When U (φ) = 0 and ω(φ) = ωBD is constant, the
theory reduces to (Jordan-Fierz-)Brans-Dicke gravity.142–144

The Bergmann-Wagoner theory (8) can be expressed in a diﬀerent form through
a scalar ﬁeld redeﬁnition ϕ = ϕ(φ) and a conformal transformation of the metric
µν = A−2(ϕ)gµν. In particular, ﬁxing A(ϕ) = φ−1/2, the Jordan-frame
gµν → g(cid:63)
action (8) transforms into the Einstein-frame action

S =

where g(cid:63) and R(cid:63) are the determinant and Ricci scalar of g(cid:63)
µν, respectively, and the
potential V (ϕ) ≡ A4(ϕ)U (φ(ϕ)). The price paid for the minimal coupling of the
scalar ﬁeld in the gravitational sector is the nontrivial coupling in the matter sector
of the action: particle masses and fundamental constants depend on the scalar ﬁeld.
The actions (8) and (9) are just diﬀerent representations of the same the-
ory,145, 146 so it is legitimate (and customary) to choose the conformal frame in
which calculations are simpler. For instance, in vacuum the Einstein-frame action
(9) formally reduces to the GR action minimally coupled with a scalar ﬁeld. It may
then be necessary to change the conformal frame when extracting physically mean-
ingful statements (since the scalar ﬁeld is minimally coupled to matter in the Jordan
frame, test particles follow geodesics of the Jordan-frame metric, not of the Einstein-
frame metric). The relation between Jordan-frame and Einstein-frame quantites is

simply φ = A−2(ϕ), 3 + 2ω(φ) = α(ϕ)−2, where α(ϕ) ≡ d(ln A(ϕ))/dϕ.147

Many phenomenological studies neglect the scalar potential, setting U (φ) = 0 or
V (ϕ) = 0.b If the potential vanishes, the theory is characterized by a single function
α(ϕ). The expansion of this function around the asymptotic value ϕ0 can be written
in the form

α(ϕ) = α0 + β0(ϕ − ϕ0) + . . .

(10)

The choice α(ϕ) = α0 =constant (i.e., ω(φ) =constant) corresponds to Brans-Dicke
theory. A more general formulation, proposed by Damour and Esposito-Far`ese, is
parametrized by α0 and β0.149, 150 Another simple variant is massive Brans-Dicke
theory, in which α(ϕ) is constant, but the potential is nonvanishing and has the
s ∼ U(cid:48)(cid:48)(φ0).
form U (φ) = 1
Since the scalar ﬁeld ϕ in the action (9) is dimensionless, the function α(ϕ) and the
constants α0, β0 are dimensionless as well.

scalar ﬁelds to matter.134, 151

bThis approximation corresponds to neglecting the cosmological term, the mass of the scalar
ﬁeld and possible self-interactions. In an asymptotically ﬂat spacetime the scalar ﬁeld tends to
a constant φ0 at spatial inﬁnity, corresponding to a minimum of U (φ). Taylor expanding U (φ)
around φ0 yields, at the lowest orders, a cosmological constant and a mass term for the scalar
ﬁeld.141, 148

Astrophysical observations set bounds on the parameter space of scalar-tensor
theories. In the case of Brans-Dicke theory, the best observational bound (α0 <

3.5 × 10−3) comes from the Cassini measurement of the Shapiro time delay.152 An

interesting feature of scalar-tensor gravity is the prediction of characteristic physical
phenomena which do not occur in GR. Even though we know from observations
that α0 (cid:28) 1 and that GR deviations are generally small, these phenomena may
lead to observable consequences. The best known example is the fact that compact
binary systems in scalar-tensor gravity emit dipolar gravitational radiation.153, 154
Dipolar gravitational radiation is “pre-Newtonian,” i.e. it occurs at lower PN order
than quadrupole radiation, and it does not exist in GR. In the more general case
with β0 (cid:54)= 0, the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization (described below) can
lead in principle to macroscopic modiﬁcations in the structure of NSs, signiﬁcantly
aﬀecting the amount of dipolar radiation emitted by a binary system. Therefore the
best constraints in the (α0, β0) plane come from observations of NS-NS and NS-WD
binary systems.155 Observations of compact binary systems also constrain massive
Brans-Dicke theory, leading to exclusion regions in the (α0, ms) plane.148

3.1.1. Spontaneous scalarization in compact stars

An interesting feature of scalar-tensor theories is the existence of nonperturbative
NS solutions in which the scalar ﬁeld amplitude is ﬁnite even for α0 (cid:28) 1: this
phenomenon, known as spontaneous scalarization,149, 150 may signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the mass and radius of a NS, and therefore the orbital motion of a compact binary
system, even far from coalescence. A simple way to illustrate the principle behind
spontaneous scalarization is by taking the limit in which the scalar ﬁeld ϕ is a small
perturbation around a GR solution.156 Expanding around the constant value ϕ0 to
ﬁrst order in ˆϕ ≡ ϕ − ϕ0 (cid:28) 1, the ﬁeld equations in the Einstein frame (11) read
(13a)

µν ,

G(cid:63)
µν = 8πT (cid:63)
(cid:3)(cid:63) ˆϕ = −4πα0T (cid:63) − 4πβ0 ˆϕT (cid:63) .

(13b)

Here we have assumed analyticity around ϕ ∼ ϕ0 and we have used Eq. (10). It
is clear from Eq. (13b) that α0 controls the eﬀective coupling between the scalar
and matter. Various observations, such as weak-gravity constraints and tests of
violations of the strong equivalence principle, require α0 to be negligibly small when
the scalar tends to its asymptotic value.150, 155, 157 This implies that a conﬁguration
in which the scalar ϕ ≈ ϕ0 and α0 ≈ 0 should be at least an approximate solution
in most viable scalar-tensor theories. With α0 = 0, any background GR solution
solves the ﬁeld equations above at ﬁrst order in the scalar ﬁeld. At this order, the
Klein-Gordon equation reads

(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:63) − µ2

s(xν)(cid:3) ˆϕ = 0 ,

Thus, the coupling of the scalar ﬁeld to matter is equivalent to an eﬀective xν-
dependent mass. Depending on the sign of β0T (cid:63), the eﬀective mass squared can

s(xν) ≡ −4πβ0T (cid:63) .

be negative. Because typicallyc −T (cid:63) ≈ ρ(cid:63) > 0 , this happens when β0 < 0. When
µ2
s < 0 in a suﬃciently large region inside the NS, scalar perturbations of a GR
equilibrium solution develop a tachyonic instability associated with an exponen-
tially growing mode, which causes the growth of scalar hair in a process similar to
ferromagnetism.149, 150

Spherically symmetric NSs develop spontaneous scalarization for β0 (cid:46) −4.35.160

Detailed investigations of stellar structure,150, 161 numerical simulations of col-
lapse162–165 and stability studies160, 166 conﬁrmed that spontaneously scalarized con-
ﬁgurations would indeed be the end-state of stellar collapse in these theories. This is
subject, however, to the collapse process reaching a suﬃcient level of compactness.
Recent simulations of supernova core collapse identiﬁed clear signatures of spon-
taneous scalarization when the collapse ultimately formed a BH, but not in case
of neutron-star end products, as these were not compact enough. Further studies
using more elaborate treatment of the microphysics and/or relaxing symmetry as-
sumptions are needed to determine how generic a feature this is in core collapse
scenarios. Finally, spontaneously scalarized conﬁgurations may also be the result of
semiclassical vacuum instabilities.167–170

The nonradial oscillation modes of spontaneously scalarized, nonrotating stars
were studied by various authors.171–174 The bottom line is that the oscillation fre-
quencies can diﬀer signiﬁcantly from their GR counterparts if spontaneous scalariza-
tion modiﬁes the equilibrium properties of the star (e.g., the mass-radius relation) by
appreciable amounts. However, current binary pulsar observations yield very tight

constraints on spontaneous scalarization – implying in particular that β (cid:38) −4.5

– and the oscillation modes of scalarized stars for viable theory parameters are
unlikely to diﬀer from their GR counterparts by any measurable amount. Note,
however, that the binary pulsar constraints on β apply to the case of massless ST
theories. For massive scalars, much larger (negative) β and correspondingly stronger
eﬀects on the structure and dynamics of compact objects may be possible.175

Spinning NSs at ﬁrst order in the Hartle-Thorne slow-rotation approximation
were studied by Damour and Esposito-Far`ese150 and later by Sotani.177 At ﬁrst
order in rotation, the scalar ﬁeld only aﬀects the moment of inertia, mass and
radius of the NS. Second-order calculations176 are necessary to compute corrections
to the spin-induced quadrupole moment, tidal and rotational Love numbers, as
well as higher-order corrections to the NS mass and to the scalar charge. Figure 1
shows representative examples of the properties of NSs in a scalar-tensor theory
with spontaneous scalarization at second order in the rotation parameter.

Rapidly rotating NSs in scalar-tensor theories were recently constructed178 by
extending the RNS code.179 Scalarization eﬀects are stronger – and deviations from
GR are larger – for rapidly spinning NSs.180, 181 Therefore, despite the tight binary
pulsar bounds, it is still possible that spontaneous scalarization may occur in rapidly

cSome nuclear equations of state (EOSs) allow for positive T (cid:63) in the NS interior, with potentially
interesting phenomenological implications.158, 159

rotating stars.

Old, isolated NSs, as well as the NSs whose inspiral and merger we expect to
observe with GW detectors, are expected to be rotating well below their mass-
shedding limit. However these considerations may not apply just before merger,
where the rotational frequencies of each NS may approach the mass-shedding limit.
In these conditions, numerical simulations have also recently revealed the possibility
of “dynamical scalarization” – a growth of the scalar ﬁeld that may signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the waveform near merger, and potentially be detectable.182–186

A more exotic mechanism to amplify the eﬀects of scalarization is anisotropy
in the matter composing the star.187 Nuclear matter may be anisotropic at very

high densities, where the nuclear interactions must be treated relativistically and
phase transitions (e.g. to pion condensates or to a superﬂuid state) may occur. For
example, Nelmes and Piette188 recently considered NS structure within the Skyrme
model – a low energy, eﬀective ﬁeld theory for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) –
ﬁnding signiﬁcant anisotropic strains for stars with mass M (cid:38) 1.5M(cid:12) (see also work
by Adam et al.189, 190). The eﬀect of anisotropy is shown in Fig. 2. For illustration,
in the ﬁgure we adopt a very simple model developed in the seventies by Bowers
and Liang,191 where the degree of anisotropy is parametrized by a parameter λBL.
The left panel shows the critical threshold for scalarization as a function of stellar
compactness for several “ordinary” (isotropic) EOSs: the EOS has almost no eﬀect
on the critical threshold for scalarization, which is always around β = −4.35. The
fact that scalarization is only possible when β (cid:46) −4.35 was ﬁrst shown by Harada160

using catastrophe theory. In the right panel, on the other hand, we show that the
critical β for scalarization (and, as it turns out, also the eﬀects of scalarization on
macroscopic NS properties) increases (decreases) when the tangential pressure is
bigger (smaller) than the radial pressure.

An interesting feature of the Bowers-Liang models is that it allows for stellar
conﬁgurations with compactness approaching the Schwarzschild limit r = 2M . Yagi
and Yunes used this observation to study the recently found “I-Love-Q” universal
relations – which relate bulk NS properties such as the moment of inertia, spin-
induced quadrupole moment and tidal deformability in an EOS-independent way –
as NSs approach the BH limit.192–194

Einstein-frame formulation of the theory is equivalent to GR minimally coupled to
a scalar ﬁeld. BHs in Bergmann-Wagoner theories satisfy the same no-hair theorem
as in GR, and thus the stationary BH solutions in the two theories coincide.195–197
Moreover, dynamical (vacuum) BH spacetimes satisfy a similar generalized no-hair
theorem: the dynamics of a BH binary system in Bergmann-Wagoner theory with
vanishing potential are the same as in GR,134 up to at least 2.5 PN order for generic
mass ratios198 and at any PN order in the extreme mass-ratio limit.156

If there is more than one massive real scalar ﬁeld, however, or at least one
massive complex scalar ﬁeld, the situation concerning stationary BH solutions can
be very diﬀerent: axisymmetric, hairy BHs do exist,138, 199, 200 as will be reviewed in
Section 4. Tensor-multi-scalar theories have indeed received more attention in the
recent literature, as we now discuss.

3.2. Tensor-multi-scalar theories

A natural generalization of the Bergmann-Wagoner formulation (8) consists in in-
cluding more than one scalar ﬁeld coupled with gravity. The action of tensor-multi-
scalar (TMS) gravity134, 201 is:

d4x√−g(cid:0)F (φ)R − γab(φ)gµν∂µφa∂νφb − V (φ)(cid:1) + SM [Ψ, gµν] ,

S =

16π

(15)

where F and V are functions of the N scalar ﬁelds φa (a = 1 . . . N ). The scalar
ﬁelds live on a manifold (the target space) with metric γab(φ). The action (15) is
invariant not only under spacetime diﬀeomorphisms, but also under target-space
diﬀeomorphisms, i.e. scalar ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. TMS theories are more complex than
theories with a single scalar ﬁeld, since the geometry of the target space can aﬀect
the dynamics.

The simplest extension of a ST theory with a single real scalar ﬁeld is a theory
with two real scalar ﬁelds. If we work, equivalently, with a single complex scalar ϕ
instead, the action reduces to

Hereafter we assume that the potential vanishes, i.e. V (ϕ, ¯ϕ) = 0, and that the
target space is maximally symmetric. Upon stereographic projection and ﬁeld re-

and in the second line we have split the ﬁeld ψ into real and imaginary parts:
ψ ≡ Re[ψ] + i Im[ψ]. The structure of this theory when α = 0 is determined by
three real parameters: β0 + β1, β0 − β1 and the target-space curvature r2. When
α (cid:54)= 0, two further parameters (|α| and arg α) are necessary to deﬁne the theory.
This two-scalar model is the simplest generalization of the spontaneous scalariza-
tion model by Damour and Esposito-Far`ese.149 Note that the quantity |α|2 ≡ α ¯α ≡
Re[α]2 +Im[α]2 is strongly constrained by observations, similarly to the single-scalar
case. However, in TMS theories α is a complex quantity and its argument, arg α,
is unconstrained in the weak-ﬁeld regime. When α = 0, the conformal coupling at
second order in ψ reduces to

Compact stars in theories with α = 0 and α (cid:54)= 0 are rather diﬀerent. When α = 0
and β1 (cid:54)= 0, the theory is invariant under the symmetries ψ → ¯ψ and ψ → −ψ.
In this case, we only found solutions where either the real or the imaginary part of
the scalar ﬁeld has a non-trivial proﬁle; these theories are eﬀectively equivalent to
single-scalar theories.

When α (cid:54)= 0 the situation is more interesting, as shown in Fig. 3. Introduc-
tion of α ∈ R partially breaks this symmetry down to conjugation only, whereas
introduction of α ∈ C fully breaks the symmetry. Now GR conﬁgurations are not

solutions of the ﬁeld equations. In particular, a constant (or zero) scalar ﬁeld does

we can ﬁnd solutions with two nontrivial scalar proﬁles even when β0 = β1 = 0. A
more interesting question is whether there are stellar conﬁgurations in which both
scalar ﬁelds have a large amplitude. These “biscalarized” solutions are absent in
the α = 0 case, but as it turns out they exist when α (cid:54)= 0. For concreteness, in the
ﬁgure we set |α| = 10−3, so that the theory is compatible with experimental bounds
from binary pulsar observations. We set 1/r = 0 (i.e., for simplicity we consider a
ﬂat target space), we ﬁx β0 = −5, and we vary arg α in the range [0, 2π] in steps
of π/6. As shown in Fig. 3 – where dots denote the real and imaginary parts of the
central value of the scalar ﬁeld ψ0 for which solutions were found – there are several
solutions where both the real and imaginary part of the scalar ﬁeld are nonzero. The
solutions are at least approximately O(2) symmetric when β1 ∼ |α|. The symme-
try is broken (the solution “circles” turn into “crosses”) when β1 (cid:29) |α|, and the

towards a set of solutions on the vertical line Re[ψ0] = 0 for the larger values of β1
(bottom panels in Fig. 3). For the case α = 0, it is easy to see from Eq. (22) that
spontaneous scalarization of Re[ψ] occurs (in analogy with the single-ﬁeld case) if

β0 + β1 (cid:46) −4.35, and that scalarized models with a large imaginary part Im[ψ]
exist if β0 − β1 (cid:46) −4.35. Our biscalarized models have been calculated for ﬁxed
β0 = −5. For β1 (cid:38) 0.65 we therefore enter the regime where β0 + β1 (cid:38) −4.35,
tion β0 − β1 (cid:46) −4.35 for scalarization of Im[ψ], however, remains satisﬁed, so that

and we no longer expect to ﬁnd models with strongly scalarized Re[ψ]. The condi-

scalarized models should cluster close to the Re[ψ0]–axis. This is indeed observed
in the bottom panels of Fig. 3. A more detailed investigation of the phenomenology
of these models is underway.

3.3. Horndeski theories

Besides the obvious addition of one or more scalar ﬁeld(s), a second possibility
to generalize scalar-tensor theories of the Bergmann-Wagoner type has recently
attracted a great deal of attention. The theory in question was ﬁrst formulated by
Horndeski,202 and it is the most general single-scalar theory with second-order ﬁeld
equations. In “modern” notation, the action of Horndeski gravity can be written in
terms of Galileon interactions203 as

The functions Gi = Gi(φ, X) depend only on the scalar ﬁeld φ and its kinetic
energy, X = −∂µφ∂µφ/2. For brevity we have also deﬁned the shorthand notation
φµ...ν ≡ ∇µ . . .∇νφ, φ2
An attractive feature of Horndeski gravity is its generality. The theory includes a
broad spectrum of phenomenological dark energy models, as well as modiﬁed gravity
theories with a single scalar degree of freedom. Some important special limits of the
theory are listed below:

(1) GR corresponds to choosing G4 = 1/2 and G2 = G3 = G5 = 0.
(2) When G4 = F (φ) and all other Gi’s are zero we recover a scalar-tensor theory
with nonminimal coupling of the form F (φ)R. Therefore Brans-Dicke theory
and f (R) gravity are special cases of Horndeski gravity.

where Λ0, η, ζ and β are constants. Incidentally, a coupling of the form Gµνφµφν
can also be obtained by setting G5 = −φ and integrating by parts208
some of the literature denotes the function G2 by the letter K.

(5) The Lagrangian L2 corresponds to the k-essence ﬁeld.209–211 For this reason,
(6) The covariant Galileon model212 corresponds to setting G2 = −c2X, G3 =
Pl/2 − c4X 2/M 6 and G5 = 3c5X 2/M 9, where the ci (i =

−c3X/M 3, G4 = M 2
2, . . . , 5) are constants and M is a constant with dimensions of mass.

Because of the generality of Horndeski gravity, a comprehensive review of com-
pact objects would inevitably have to discuss important subclasses that have been
studied for a long time.6 A more speciﬁc review of compact objects in the subclasses
4–6 can be found in this same volume,213 and some examples are also discussed in
another review.138 In the next paragraph we complement these reviews focusing on
recent work in EdGB gravity.

3.4. Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

In EdGB gravity214 (see Section 3.3), the Gauss-Bonnet invariant (27) is coupled
with a scalar ﬁeld d. The resulting action of EdGB gravity, Eq. (26), is a special

dThe normalization of the scalar is diﬀerent from those in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, by a factor 2.

case of Horndeski gravity, as discussed in Section 3.3. With the choice ξ(φ) = αφ
this theory is shift-symmetric, and it has been shown215 that it is the only shift-
symmetric Horndeski gravity theory in which the no-hair theorems do not hold.

EdGB gravity can also be seen as belonging to a diﬀerent class of modiﬁed grav-
ity: that of quadratic gravity theories,216, 217 in which quadratic curvature terms are
included in the action. EdGB gravity holds a special place as the only quadratic
gravity theory with equations of motion of second diﬀerential order. Other theories
of quadratic curvature gravity (e.g. dynamical Chern-Simons gravity218, 219) have
equations of motion of higher diﬀerential order, and are then subject to Ostrograd-
ski’s instability.220 In order to avoid this instability they should be considered as
eﬀective theories, obtained as truncations of more general theories. In other words,
EdGB gravity is consistent for any value of the coupling constant, while other
quadratic gravity theories should only be considered in the weak-coupling limit.
Note also that the EdGB term without the coupling to a scalar ﬁeld would be
trivial, since R2

GB is a total derivative.

Including a quadratic curvature term in the action is an interesting modiﬁcation
of GR, for a variety of reasons. First of all, this is the simplest way to modify the
strong-curvature regime of gravity, and, second, it is also a way to circumvent no-
hair theorems (see the discussion in Sections 3.1 and 4 for diﬀerent ways to grow
BH hair). Moreover, quadratic curvature terms can make the theory renormaliz-
able.221 In particular, the EdGB term naturally arises in low-energy eﬀective string
theories222, 223 when ξ(φ) = αeφ/4.

Hereafter we consider EdGB gravity with ξ(φ) = αeφ/4. The ﬁrst BH solution
of this theory, derived about 20 years ago by Kanti et al.,214 is a numerical solution
describing a spherically symmetric BH. The solution has scalar hair, i.e. a non-
trivial conﬁguration of the scalar ﬁeld, but only secondary hair (the scalar charge
D is determined by the mass M , and hence is not a free parameter. It can be shown
that Kanti’s solution only exists for214, 224

0 < α/M 2 (cid:46) 0.691 ,

(31)

where M is the BH mass. The best observational bound on the coupling parameter
is α (cid:46) 47 M 2(cid:12).225 This bound is weaker than the theoretical bound (31) for BHs
with M (cid:46) 8.2 M(cid:12).226

In recent years, numerical solutions describing slowly rotating224 and rapidly
rotating227 BHs have been derived. These solutions describe stationary BHs for all
values of the mass and the spin, and for all values of the coupling parameter in
the allowed range (31). However, these solutions require a numerical integration for
each set of parameters. In order to devise and implement observational tests based
on astrophysical or GW observations (for instance, for Monte Carlo data analysis),
an approximate, analytical solution can be more useful than numerical solutions.

Analytical BH solutions in EdGB theory have been determined as perturbative
expansions in the dimensionless coupling parameter ζ = α/M 2 and the dimension-
less spin ¯a = J/M 2, at order O(ζ 2, ¯a0),216, 228 O(ζ 2, ¯a1),217 O(ζ 2, ¯a2),229 and ﬁnally

at order O(ζ 7, ¯a5).230 For a slowly rotating BH, the solution derived in230 repro-
duces the most relevant geodesic quantities (the ISCO location and the epyciclic
frequencies) within 1%, for the entire allowed range (31) of the coupling parameter.
Astrophysical observations from the near-horizon region of BHs can allow tests
of GR against modiﬁed theories (such as EdGB gravity) which predict deviations
in the strong-ﬁeld, high-curvature regime. Indeed, near the horizon of stellar-mass
BHs the spacetime curvature is very large, and (for suﬃciently large values of α)
BH solutions in EdGB theory may be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the Kerr solution.
These deviations can aﬀect observable quantities, such as the quasi-periodic oscil-
lations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray ﬂux of accreting BHs.226 Indeed, in many
astrophysical models the frequencies of these QPOs are appropriate combinations
of the epicyclic frequencies of the (near-horizon) BH geodesics, in which the strong-
ﬁeld regime of gravity is manifest. Therefore future large-area X-ray telescopes such
as LOFT231 could set constraints on the coupling parameter α. For instance, the
detection of two QPO triplets from a BH with M = 5.3 M(cid:12) and ¯a = 0.2 by a
detector having the LOFT design sensitivity could exclude the range ζ (cid:38) 0.4 with
3σ conﬁdence.226

4. Implications of superradiant instabilities for fundamental

physics and astrophysics

In the previous section we focused on speciﬁc modiﬁcations of Einstein’s gravity
and on the diﬀerent physical consequences, as well as compact object solutions, that
arise in these models. Perhaps somewhat more surprisingly, even within Einstein’s
gravity, considering simple fundamental ﬁelds that satisfy the energy conditions can
also lead to new types of compact objects, with interesting physical consequences.
In this section we will review these recent developments, that are related to the
complex phenomenon known as superradiance.232

We have deﬁned κ = 16π, and Fµν ≡ ∇µAν − ∇νAµ is the Maxwell tensor. Both
the scalar and vector ﬁelds are assumed to be complex, for reasons that will become
clear soon. The mass mB of the bosons under consideration is related to the mass
parameters above through µS,V = mB/. By “fundamental” we mean ﬁelds which
are not eﬀective descriptions of other microscopic degrees of freedom. For most of
the analysis below, however, the true nature of these ﬁelds (i.e., whether they are
truly fundamental or rather a coarse-grained representation of more fundamental
degrees of freedom), is not relevant. Each of them is completely equivalent to two

March 22, 2016 0:27 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

real scalar or vector ﬁelds, but some of our considerations below apply equally well
to one or many real scalar and vector ﬁelds.

The theories represented by this action are relevant for several reasons. Because
they are simple, they can be thought of as proxies for more complex interactions, of
which they would be faithful models in certain regimes (presumably when higher-
order interactions are negligible). Fundamental bosons also play a key role in particle
physics. For instance they could describe the axion or axion-like particles, originally
intended to solve the strong-CP problem in QCD, which recently gained prominence
as dark-matter candidates.233–235 In this context, self-gravitating solutions of fun-
damental ﬁelds allow us to understand and study quantitatively the growth of dark
matter structures and their clustering inside compact stars.236, 237

Whether or not they form a signiﬁcant component of dark matter, minimally
coupled fundamental ﬁelds should obey the equivalence principle and freely fall in
the same way as standard model ﬁelds. Thus, the most promising channel to look
for their imprints consists of gravitational interactions.

4.2. Superradiance and superradiant instabilities

Fundamental ﬁelds in the presence of gravity display of course a panoply of in-
teresting eﬀects, such as the critical phenomena identiﬁed in Choptuik’s seminal
study.238 In strong gravitational ﬁelds, one of the most peculiar is superradiance,
i.e., the ampliﬁcation of low-frequency waves scattering oﬀ rotating BHs.232, 239, 240
Superradiance is required by the second law of thermodynamics, and is akin to tidal
acceleration in planetary dynamics.241 Superradiance is active for low-frequency,
bosonic ﬁelds satisfying the superradiance condition

ω < mΩ ,

(33)

with m an integer azimuthal number and Ω the angular frequency of the BH. The
amplitude of the superradiant ampliﬁcation of any incident wave depends on the
rotation Ω, on the wave frequency ω and on the ﬁeld being scattered.232, 242

Superradiant mechanisms can trigger instabilities in spacetimes that are able to
conﬁne the ﬂuctuations. In such cases, the wave is forced to bounce back and forth,
being repeatedly ampliﬁed upon interaction with the BH, and leading to exponential
growth of linearized ﬂuctuations. This mechanism is called a black hole bomb,243–246
and leads to instabilities in truly conﬁned spacetimes like anti-de Sitter.247–251

It is interesting that the same mechanism also makes Kerr BHs unstable un-
der massive, scalar-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations,252–255 vector-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations256–258 or even
tensor-ﬁeld perturbations.259 Physically, massive states prevent full leakage to in-
ﬁnity and act as an eﬀective barrier for low-frequency waves.

4.3. Hairy black holes bifurcating from the Kerr solution

Since Kerr BHs are unstable against suﬃciently low frequency modes of a massive
bosonic ﬁeld, a relevant question is: what is the endpoint of the instability? While

March 22, 2016 0:27 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

25

this is still an open question (but see Section 4.3.4 below), a relevant observation
is the existence of stationary, asymptotically ﬂat BH solutions of the model (32),
which are regular on and outside the event horizon and for which the horizon is
in equilibrium with a non-trivial scalar or vector ﬁeld condensate. Moreover these
BHs are continuously connected with the Kerr solution, and as such they have
been dubbed Kerr BHs with scalar199, 200, 260 or Proca hair 261. They are manifestly
related to the phenomenon of superradiance, as they exist at the threshold of the
inequality (33), and they are likely to play a role either as endpoints or as long-lived
intermediate states in the development of the superradiant instability of Kerr BHs
in the presence of massive scalar or vector ﬁelds.

The existence of these hairy BH solutions raises three immediate questions:
(1) “How is it possible that stationary, asymptotically ﬂat BH solutions diﬀerent
from Kerr exist in the very simple model (32), in view of the well-known no-hair
theorems that apply to this model (in particular the pioneering theorems due to
Bekenstein for the scalar262 and Proca263, 264 cases)?” (see also Ref. 138 for a review
of no-hair theorems applying to the scalar case).

(2) “If these hairy BH solutions are continuously connected to the Kerr solution,
then there must be an imprint of their existence when we consider the corresponding
matter ﬁelds on the Kerr background as test ﬁelds. Is it so?”

(3) “Do these BHs trivialize in the limit of vanishing horizon or is there some

residual gravitating conﬁguration in this limit?”

We shall tackle each of these questions in the following three subsections.

4.3.1. Circumventing no-hair theorems

The answer to (1) is simple and enlightening: theorems have assumptions and as-
sumptions can be dropped. In the present case, an assumption in many of the
no-hair theorems, including those of Bekenstein, is that the metric and the mat-
ter ﬁeld share the same symmetries. This is not necessary: the spacetime and the
energy-momentum tensor should share the same symmetries, but not the matter
ﬁeld itself. This apparently innocuous observation allows us to circumvent the sim-
plest Bekenstein-type no-hair theorems, but observe that it is a necessary but not
suﬃcient ingredient. The reason will become clear in the following.

Kerr BHs with scalar199 and Proca261 hair reads:

(cid:21)
+r2 sin2 θe2F2(r,θ)[dϕ−W (r, θ)dt]2
(34)
where N (r) ≡ 1 − rH /r and rH is a constant. The metric is completely determined
by four functions of the spheroidal coordinates (r, θ). These coordinates reduce to
prolate spheroidal coordinates (rather than the more familiar oblate spheroidal ones,
obtained in the ﬂat-spacetime limit of the Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr metric)
in an appropriate Minkowski limit.261 A simple analysis shows that rH =constant

March 22, 2016 0:27 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

surfaces are null (assuming they are regular). On these surfaces, null orbits with θ =
constant have an angular velocity, as measured by the observer at inﬁnity, ΩH ≡
W (rH , θ). From the numerical solutions, it turns out that ΩH is θ-independent and
r = rH is a Killing horizon of the Killing vector ﬁeld ξ = ∂t + ΩH ∂ϕ. Thus r = rH
is the event horizon. Observe that the line element (34) admits two independent
Killing vector ﬁelds: k ≡ ∂t and m = ∂ϕ.

On the other hand, the “matter” ansatz that has been used to ﬁnd the hairy

BHs is

for the scalar case,199 and

Ψ(t, r, θ, ϕ) = e

−iωt+imϕφ(r, θ)

(35)

A(t, r, θ, ϕ) = e

−iωt+imϕ{i[V (r, θ)dt + H3(r, θ) sin θdϕ] + H1(r, θ)dr + H2(r, θ)dθ} ,

(36)
for the Proca case.261 The two constant parameters ω, m are the frequency and
azimuthal quantum number, with ω ∈ R+, m ∈ Z/{0}. An immediate observation

is that the matter ﬁelds are not invariant under the two aforementioned Killing
vector ﬁelds:

LkAµ (cid:54)= 0 ,

LmAµ (cid:54)= 0 ,

LkΨ (cid:54)= 0 ,

LmΨ (cid:54)= 0 ,

but the corresponding energy momentum-tensors are

LkT (Ψ)

αβ = 0 ,

LkT (A)

αβ = 0 ,

LmT (Ψ)

αβ = 0 ,

LmT (A)

αβ = 0 .

(37)

(38)

Thus Bekenstein-type theorems are inapplicable and the absence of hair is no longer
guaranteed, but the left- and right-hand sides of the Einstein equations still have
the same symmetries.

The ansatz (34), in combination with (35) or (36), yields axially symmetric
solutions. One may wonder whether BH solutions could also exist in the much
simpler spherically symmetric case, obtained by taking W = 0 and F1 = F2 in (34)
and m = 0 and φ = φ(r) in (35); H2 = H3 = 0 and V = V (r), H1 = H1(r) in (36),
respectively. In that case, however, it was shown for both the scalar case265 and
the Proca case261 that no BH solutions exist. Thus, as mentioned above, symmetry
(of the metric) non-inheritance by the matter ﬁelds is a necessary but not suﬃcient
ingredient. A further ingredient is necessary; this can be seen by answering question
(2) above.

4.3.2. Stationary clouds and the threshold of superradiance

The answer to question (2) above is “yes.” A test ﬁeld analysis shows the exis-
tence of stationary, everywhere regular (on and outside the horizon) solutions of
the scalar199, 266–268 or Proca ﬁeld261 on the Kerr BH spacetime: stationary scalar
or Proca clouds around Kerr BHs. The existence of these stationary clouds is inti-
mately related to superradiance, as we now illustrate for the scalar case.

Here M and a are the ADM mass and ADM angular momentum per unit mass
of the Kerr solution, and ∆ ≡ r2 − 2M r + a2. Λ is the separation constant, that
reduces to the familiar (cid:96)((cid:96) + 1) in the Schwarzschild limit.
The angular equation deﬁnes the spheroidal harmonics. To tackle the radial wave
equation, looking for bound state solutions, one requires exponentially decaying
solutions towards spatial inﬁnity and a purely ingoing boundary condition on the
horizon (in a frame co-rotating with the horizon). Then, one ﬁnds in general that the
frequency ω is complex: ω = R(ω) + iI(ω). For R(ω) = mΩH , however, I(ω) = 0
and thus one ﬁnds truly stationary states with a real frequency. This condition is
interpreted as a zero mode of the superradiant instability, which sets in for R(ω) <
mΩH yielding I(ω) > 0.
This bound state problem becomes particularly simple and elegant for extremal
Kerr BHs.266 In this case the radial equation above, generically of conﬂuent Heun
type, reduces to the conﬂuent hypergeometric type, precisely the same equation
one ﬁnds for the Hydrogen atom (without spin). In this problem, the quantization
condition can be interpreted as a condition on the background parameters. Thus,
the corresponding stationary clouds – labelled by three quantum numbers (n, (cid:96), m),
where the ﬁrst is the number of nodes of the radial function and the last two are the
spheroidal harmonic indices – can only exist in a subspace of Kerr solutions, actu-
ally a one-dimensional existence line, for ﬁxed quantum numbers. This conclusion
changes, however, when the test scalar ﬁeld is allowed to have self-interactions.269
The Proca case is similar in spirit, but more involved technically, since the Proca
potentials do not decouple and no separation of variables has been observed.256, 257
To summarize: the answer to question (1) showed that there is a breach in the

wall; the answer to (2) shows that there is indeed something beyond the wall.

4.3.3. Solitonic limits and phenomenology

The construction of Kerr BHs with scalar and Proca hair adapted the technology
already in use for (rotating) boson stars.270, 271 Scalar boson stars can be con-
structed with the ansatz (34)-(35) taking rH = 0, and thus will be a limiting case
of the corresponding Kerr BHs with scalar hair.e The Einstein-Klein-Gordon sys-

eTo construct the scalar boson and Proca stars, it is useful to rescale the function W as W/r
in (34) and the function H1 as H1/r in (36).

tem of equations yields 5 coupled non-linear PDEs for the ﬁve unknown functions
plus two “constraint” equations (which are diﬀerentially related to the remaining
ones). These equations can be solved by a Newton-Raphson relaxation method.200
Likewise, the Einstein-Proca system, taking the ansatz (34)-(36), yields 8 coupled
non-linear PDEs for the eight unknown functions plus two “constraint” equations.
Solutions regular on and outside r = rH can be found, and they correspond to
Kerr BHs with Proca hair.261 The rH = 0 limit yields rotating Proca stars,272
spin-1 cousins of the aformentioned (scalar) boson stars. These observations answer
question (3) above.

The exploration of the physical and phenomenological properties of these new
families of hairy BHs connected to the Kerr solutions is ongoing research. For the
scalar case it has been noted that the hairy BHs can have quadrupoles and orbital
frequency at the ISCO quite distinct from the Kerr case.199, 200 Particularly striking
are the BH shadows that have been obtained for some examples of Kerr BHs with
scalar hair, with remarkably diﬀerent shapes and sizes from the Kerr case.273 These
shadows can be partly understood regarding the hairy BHs as composites of a boson
star with a horizon, a perspective that can also explain, for instance, the ergoregion
structure of these spacetimes.274 Generalizations of the hairy BHs to include self-
interactions of the matter ﬁeld have been considered.275, 276 It is likely that similar
generalizations are possible in the Proca case.

Finally, let us remark that Myers-Perry BHs with scalar hair have been found in
D = 5. These are also anchored to a similar condition between the frequency of the
scalar ﬁeld and the angular velocity of the horizon.277, 278 In D = 5 asymptotically
ﬂat spacetimes, vacuum Myers-Perry BHs are not, however, aﬄicted by superradiant
instabilities of massive scalar ﬁelds. As such, when the scalar ﬁeld is set equal to zero,
the hairy solutions do not reduce to vacuum Myers-Perry solutions: even though the
local geometry can become arbitrarily close to that of the vacuum solutions, there
is always a mass gap. A generalization of these solutions including higher curvature
terms has also been constructed.279

4.3.4. Can hairy BHs form?

The existence of Kerr BHs with scalar and Proca hair is theoretically interesting,
and it presents us with a rich landscape of previously unknown BH solutions in GR.
These solutions require complex bosonic ﬁelds, but extremely long-lived solutions
exist even for real ﬁelds. These solutions describe BHs surrounded by a “cloud” of
massive bosons.280 Are these solutions relevant for astrophysics? The answer to this
question depends on two main issues: (A) the existence of massive (and very light)
bosonic ﬁelds in Nature, and (B) the formation mechanism of these solutions and
their stability properties.

Question (A) is an open issue. Question (B) has been studied in a speciﬁc sce-
nario. The development of the superradiant instability of massive scalars and vectors
has recently been addressed taking into account gravitational radiation, superradi-

ant growth and the eﬀects of a putative accretion disk around the BH,281 but in
an adiabatic approximation (rather than a fully non-linear numerical evolution).
Assuming that the bosonic cloud is formed through the development of the su-
perradiant instability, it was shown that, within the previous approximations, (i)
the observation of supermassive BHs would show gaps in the Regge-plane, corre-
sponding to BHs which quickly become unstable due to superradiant eﬀects; (ii)
the bosonic cloud never backreacts signiﬁcantly on the geometry; and even though
a hairy BH can eﬀectively form, it does not depart signiﬁcantly from the Kerr
geometry.281

Progress on question (B) has also been achieved using a diﬀerent toy model:
a Reissner-Nordstr¨om BH enclosed in a cavity. This system is aﬄicted by the su-
perradiant instability of bosonic ﬁelds (not necessarily massive, since the trapping
mechanism is now provided by the cavity) and it was observed that superradiant
instabilities in this system – at the test-ﬁeld level – grow much faster than for Kerr
BHs, occurring even for spherically symmetric modes.246, 282–284 These two features
make the system tractable with current numerical relativity technology, allowing us
to perform fully non-linear evolutions of the superradiant instability.285 The simu-
lations showed that the ﬁnal states of these unstable BHs are indeed hairy BHs at
the threshold of superradiance, which can be regarded as the charged counterparts
(in this context) of Kerr BHs with scalar hair.286 Similar results have also been
obtained for superradiantly unstable charged BHs in anti-de-Sitter spacetime.251

Finally, an orthogonal process for the formation of these hairy BHs could be
starting from the solitonic limit, rather than the non-hairy BH limit. It would be
very interesting to understand if unstable rotating scalar boson (or Proca) stars
could develop into hairy BHs, and how hairy these BHs would be. This is an open
issue.

5. Analog gravity

Analog models of gravity are a useful tool to investigate kinematical aspects of
curved spacetimes in condensed matter systems.287, 288 Analogues have been pre-
sented in many contexts, like Bose-Einstein condensates, optical media, and ﬂu-
ids.289–291 Here we will give emphasis to the progress made in the latter context.
Indeed, many interesting physical properties of sonic analogues of BHs have been
recently studied, like, for instance, absorption and scattering phenomena,292–297 as
well as quasinormal modes (QNMs).298–301

5.1. Acoustic analogues

Propagation of sound waves in an ideal ﬂuid, under certain considerations, may
be described using the Klein-Gordon equation for a massless scalar ﬁeld Φ in an
eﬀective curved spacetime, namely

where gµν are the covariant components of the eﬀective metric (gµν being its con-
travariant components), with determinant g. We should emphasize that gµν is a
function of the local properties of the ﬂuid and, in general, it is not a solution of
Einstein’s equations.

5.1.1. Canonical acoustic hole

The simplest acoustic analogue to a BH is the so-called “canonical acoustic hole”.
It consists of a spherically symmetric steady ﬂow of an irrotational barotropic ﬂuid
(considered also as incompressible and inviscid), presenting a sink at the origin. It
may be described by the following line element:

−1 dr2 + r2(cid:0)dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2(cid:1) .

cah = −f (r) c2

Here

f (r) ≡ 1 − r4

H /r4,

(42)

(43)

where rH is the radius of the sonic event horizon, inside which the radial velocity
exceeds the speed of sound cs in the ﬂuid. The canonical acoustic hole is an analogue
of the Schwarzschild BH.

5.1.2. Draining bathtub

An acoustic analogue of a rotating BH is the so-called “draining bathtub”, whose
line element may be written as
dbt = −h(r) c2

−1 dr2 + (rdφ − Cdt/r)2 .

5.1.3. Hydrodynamic vortex

By setting D = 0 in Eq. (46), we are left with a purely circulating ﬂow, which, in

where rhv
is the so-called “hydrodynamic vortex”.

e ≡ |C|/cs is the outer boundary of the ergoregion. This eﬀective spacetime

In the remainder of this section we will set cs ≡ 1.

5.2. Ergoregion instabilities in acoustic systems

Ergoregion instabilities in acoustic systems have been recently studied for the hydro-
dynamic vortex, both for incompressible302 and for compressible ﬂuids.303 Here we
will review the investigation of instabilities of the hydrodynamic vortex composed
by an incompressible ﬂuid.302 (The numerical results exhibited here are obtained
for higher values of the azimuthal number m, complementing the ones exhibited in
Ref. 302).

Using the line element (47) in the Klein-Gordon equation (41), and assuming a

decomposition of the ﬁeld Φ as

(cid:19)2

we ﬁnd the ordinary diﬀerential equation

i.e.,

where m is an integer number related with the angular momentum, and ω is the

Solutions describing QNMs can be obtained from Eq. (49), considering the

asymptotic behavior at large radial distances

uωm (r → ∞) ∼ exp (iωr) ,

(51)

and a boundary condition of Neumann type at r = rmin (close to the center of the
vortex):

This condition is related to a cutoﬀ on the radial velocity increment,

r=rmin

= 0 [cf. Eq. (48)].302

Ergoregion instabilities are present in acoustic systems possessing an ergoregion
but not an event horizon. These instabilities are developed inside the ergoregion, i.e.,
for r < |C|.302 In order to obtain the QNM frequencies of the hydrodynamic vortex,
we can use diﬀerent numerical techniques to integrate Eq. (49) in the frequency
domain. Some results for QNM frequencies are exhibited in Table 1, for diﬀerent

methods. Real and imaginary parts of the QNM frequencies are plotted in Fig. 4,

ted as a function of rmin, for C = 0.5 and m = 5, 6, 7. These results were obtained via the CF

From the results exhibited in Table 1, it can be seen that as the azimuthal num-
ber m increases, the magnitude of the real (imaginary) part of the QNM frequencies
increases (decreases). Moreover, from the plots exhibited in Fig. 4, we ﬁnd that as
rmin decreases, the magnitude of the real and imaginary parts of the QNM frequen-
cies increase (decrease) for unstable (stable) modes. This behavior of the imaginary
part can be clearly seen in the inset of the right panel of Fig. 4.

5.3. Acoustic clouds

As analogues to the clouds around rotating BHs, described in Section 4.3.2, we
may have acoustic clouds around the draining bathtub. Taking advantage of the
symmetries of the draining bathtub spacetime, characterized by Eq. (44), we can
search for solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation (41), assuming the separation of
variables

Φm(r, φ, t) = ei(mφ−ωt)ζm(r).

In order to have clouds we must choose ω = ωc ≡ mΩH , and enclose the system
inside a “barrier” located at r = r0. At the “barrier” we impose suitable boundary
conditions, usually chosen to be of Dirichlet or Neumann type.302

In Fig. 5 we analyze the behavior of the acoustic clouds by plotting the values
of the frontier location r0 as a function of the angular velocity at the horizon ΩH ,
for diﬀerent choices of the azimuthal number m. We see that, for a ﬁxed position
r0 of the barrier, the acoustic clouds occur for smaller values of ΩH as we increase
the value of m.

Three-dimensional plots of the radial and azimuthal proﬁles of acoustic clouds
are shown in Fig. 6, for Dirichlet (left panel) and Neumann (right panel) boundary
conditions.

6. Concluding Remarks

The fantastic conceptual and formal elegance of Einstein’s gravity hides a tremen-
dous complexity when it is applied to realistic, dynamical systems. Quite often, all
hope of ﬁnding elegant analytic solutions is lost. Then, to tackle this complexity,
one needs to resort to numerical solutions. This necessity is now well understood by
the scientiﬁc community and with the current available techniques, together with
the ones under development, there is a strong belief that a lot can be learned about
the most elegant physical theory – or generalizations thereof – in the strong ﬁeld,
dynamical regime. We foresee interesting times ahead.
