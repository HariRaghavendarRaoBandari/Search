Abstract

Recently Guduru and coworkers have demonstrated with neat theory and
experiments that both increase of strength and of toughness are possible
in the contact of a rigid sphere with concentric single scale of waviness,
against a very soft material. The present note tries to answer the question
of a multiscale enhancement of adhesion, considering a Weierstrass series to
represent the multiscale roughness, and analytical results only are used. It is
concluded that the enhancement is bounded for low fractal dimensions but it
can happen, and possibly to very high values, whereas it is even unbounded
for high fractal dimensions, but it is also much less likely to occur, because
of separated contacts.

1. Introduction

Guduru and collaborators (Guduru (2007), Guduru & Bull (2007), Wa-
ters et al (2009)) have recently considered a model in which a sphere has a
superposed waviness, as deﬁned by the axisymmetric form

f (r) =

r2
2R

+ A(cid:18)1 − cos

2πr

λ (cid:19)

(1)

i.e. with concentric waviness, where R is the sphere radius, λ is wavelength of
roughness (see an example in Fig.1). Guduru also shows that similar results
are obtained if a plane roughness is assumed, similar to the function above

by with x−coordinate rather than r. Guduru shows that very signiﬁcant
(one order of magnitude) increase of strength as well as toughness can be
obtained by adding roughness, i.e. with respect to the smooth case. It should
be immediately remarked that Jin et al (2011) have since then shown that
some of the enhancement obtained by Guduru is speciﬁc to this assumption
(either axisymmetric or purely 1D roughness), and therefore we may expect
much less enhancement for, say, random roughness.

The concentric waviness permits a quite simple exact axisymmetric anal-
ysis, assuming a simply connected contact area develops. Already for a single
waviness as in Guduru (2007), there are some limitations for this solution
to hold, as clearly for ”suﬃciently” large amplitude of roughness a realistic
solution will show some separated contacts. Also, Waters et al (2009) have
clariﬁed that much of the enhancement comes from the assumption of JKR
regime, and therefore one needs to check also the ”Tabor parameter”.

We shall here try to repeat some of the Guduru (2007) aspects of the
solution, in the context of a multiscale roughness, as it is more likely to occur
in practical cases, using for simplicity a Weierstrass series instead of a single
sinusoid, which was used in related contexts in Ciavarella et al (2000) without
adhesion for the fully separated regime, and by Aﬀerrante et al (2015) with
adhesion, but with limited results concerning loading phase. Speciﬁcally, we
assume

f (r) = f0 (r) + g0

γ(D−2)n cos (2πγnr/λ0)

where f0 (r) is a ”smooth proﬁle” deﬁning function, which is a convex punch
for example f0 (r) = r2
2R – we introduce this to avoid having to deal with a
fully periodic surface, for which the ”smooth” behaviour is itself more diﬃcult
to deﬁne. If γ > 1 and D > 1,eq. (2) deﬁnes, in a plane section, a plane
fractal surface of fractal dimension D (the real surface dimension will be one
unit higher), where we have

roughness may equally be present in the other body, although Guduru for
his experiments considered a rough rigid sphere against an elastic nominally

2. Some results

Waters et al (2009) give a good summary of Guduru’s theory and exper-
iments: it is shown that the load oscillates when it crosses a crest of a wave,
and this results in highly ”wavy” curves. We will not give detailed account
of this theory, as we shall instead concentrate on an asymptotic expansion
solution (which permits, by joining all the minima and maxima of the re-
sulting function, also to obtain an ”envelope” solution) given by Kesari et
al (2011) for small wavelength, in particular λ << a, where a is the contact
area radius.

Kesari et al (2011) suggest that if roughness is described by a function
λ0̺ (r/λ0) , where the dimensionless function ̺ (r/λ0) can be expanded in
Fourier series. Here, we shall use directly the Kesari result as a special case
for the Weierstrass series in order to get deterministic results for the maxima
and minima. Weierstrass is in fact a restricted form of Fourier series as we
shall consider γ as integer and

̺ (ξ) =

∞

Xn=0

an cos (2πγnξ)

(4)

According to the Kesari et al (2011) expansion, the equilibrium curves

are described by load PK (a) and approach hK (a)

PK (a) = PM (a) − E∗p2πa3λ0ρ (a/λ0)
hK (a) = hM (a) −r πaλ

ρ (a/λ0)

2

(5)

(6)

where E∗ is plane strain elastic modulus, hM (a) , PM (a) correspond to the
smooth proﬁle solution, and for ξ = a/λ0, the function ρ (ξ) is given by

ρ (ξ) =

∞

Xn=0p2πγnh−an sin(cid:16)2πγnξ −

π

4(cid:17)i

(7)

Guduru’s case is recovered when a0 = A/λ = A/λ0, and the macroscopic
shape f0 (r) is Hertzian parabola. To ﬁnd the envelope, one simply needs to

4

take the maxima and minima of the equilibrium curve, which are trivial for
a single sinusoid. In fact, in this case

PK (a) = PM (a) ± 2πE∗

hK (a) = hM (a) ± π

Before proceeding further, let us notice that an interesting feature emerges
in general, and that is that the smooth proﬁle solution hM (a) , PM (a) con-
tains a proﬁle-independent contribution (which essentially is the ﬂat punch
solution term in the JKR process), and a proﬁle dependent part hM,prof ile (a) , PM,prof ile (a).
With this separation, for example using 2.12a, 2.13a of Kesari et al (2011),
one can derive at the quite general expressions for the Weierstrass series

a nominally ﬂat contact with a single scale sinusoidal waviness of amplitude

In the general case, if we had used a Fourier representation of roughness,
we would not have known how the maxima and minima of the various Fourier
components could combine. But as here we are considering a Weierstrass
series and we can take γ >> 1, then the maxima and minima simply sum

(16)
which is the case of common interest for fractal surfaces, and which is the
case where we can expect more easily enhancement anyway since alternative
solutions during loading phase only (Aﬀerrante et al, 2015) show that only in
this case of D < 1.5 we expect a limit contact area due to inﬁnite roughness:
for higher fractal dimension, the contact resembles increasingly that obtained
in the absence of adhesion, as in the classical (Ciavarella et al., 2000) solution
for the Weierstrass proﬁle.

With respect to the smooth surface therefore, it is easy to show that we

have obtained the ampliﬁcation factor for pull oﬀ as

F (α0, γ, D) =(cid:18)1 +

(b). In both cases, thick solid line is γ = 5, and dashed line is γ = 10.

We have taken in Fig.3 values of γ relatively high, as otherwise there is
no guarantee that our procedure in estimating the cumulative scale eﬀect
was accurate. Therefore, we chose γ = 5 and γ = 10 while Fig.3a and
Fig.3b distinguish for the initial value of the Johnson’s parameter. As it
is evident also from Fig.3, this factor can be extremely high for the fractal
dimensions near D = 1.5, and this is not so surprising considering that we
found the ampliﬁcation doesn’t converge for higher D. Notice also that the
for the chosen parameters of α0 = 0.56, 1, the ampliﬁcation for a single wave
= 2.45, and therefore the

√π(cid:17)2
of roughness were respectively 4 and (cid:16)1 + 1

multiscale additional enhancement is really signiﬁcant.

Obviously similar remarks can be made regarding the factor α0: the lower
this factor (and therefore the lower the adhesion eﬀect in the Johnson solution
of a single sinusoid), the higher the ampliﬁcation. So it would seem from
this analysis that the highest ampliﬁcations would occur for low α0 and
high fractal dimensions, which is exactly the case where we expect more
likely separated contact! This is simply an indication that separation is
more and more likely the higher the ampliﬁcation is expected to be in the
simply connected contact area model we are assuming.

3. Discussion

There are various reasons why the ampliﬁcations in adhesion predicted

by the theory are limited. We shall discuss them separately in order.

3.1. JKR assumption

JKR theory is strictly valid, in the classical JKR case of a sphere, when
µ > 5, but JKR works well for µ > 0.3 in practice: below µ = 0.3, the
behaviour approaches that of a rigid sphere. In the original case of the sphere,
JKR and rigid theory only diﬀer by a small prefactor in the pull-oﬀ loads,
but Tabor parameter was shown in Waters et al (2009) to limit enhancement
of the Guduru problem considerably, namely µ < 1 at the scale of the sphere
completely destroys the enhancement. Following Waters et al (2009), we can
deﬁne, for multiscale roughness, a scale-dependent Tabor parameter

µn =

σth

E∗ (cid:18) 9

2π

Rn

la (cid:19)1/3

= µ0γ−Dn/3

(18)

where σth is theoretical strength of the material, E∗ elastic modulus, la =
w/E∗ and Rn which is not a radius of a sphere, nevertheless can serve to
estimate the role of elastic deformation at the n − th scale. It is clear that,
even if at scale 0 the Tabor parameter is well in the JKR regime, with
ﬁner scales of roughness, the Tabor parameter would tend to reduce quite
fast. For example, with γ = 10 and even with low D = 1.2, this reduces
Tabor parameter at the macroscale to 1/10 just with one additional scale of
roughness. Therefore, this factor alone will limit very substantially practical
evidence of multiscale enhancement.

3.2. Loading dependence

In the original Guduru (2007) problem of a single sinusoid, the condition
α0 > 0.56 was seen to correspond to self-ﬂattening of waviness, irrespective of
the applied load, as in that case it was shown to correspond also to imposing
monotonicity of the proﬁle, so that the solution was obtained without need
of a proper, suﬃciently high loading stage. Hence, the ampliﬁcations with
this range was likely to occur. Obviously, this is the range where a single
waviness, even from the equations above, ampliﬁcation is lower than 4. But
for multiscale roughness, we could increase this. Unfortunately, we do not
know if α0 > 0.56 guarantees that self-ﬂattening occurs on all scales. A ﬁrst
consideration seems to suggest that, for D < 1.5, as αn increase, a fortiori
there should be self-ﬂattening on all scales. However, we should check if
there is also monotonicity of the proﬁle — as otherwise, even if αn > 0.56,
separated points in the proﬁle may simply not be in a condition to jump
into contact. Hence, it is useful therefore to extend Guduru’s analysis of
monotonicity to Weierstrass, by taking the derivative of the surface function

z′ (r) = f ′0 (r) + g0

2π
λ0

∞

Xn=0

γ(D−1)n sin (2πγnr/λ0)

(19)

The second term of this is obviously is related to the full contact pressure
under adhesionless conditions of the Weierstrass proﬁle contact (Ciavarella
et al., 2000)

p (x) = ¯p +

(21)

(22)

For γ > 1 and D > 1, the series (22) does not converge1. This suggests
that the monotonicity condition which Guduru could guarantee for just one

term of waviness, independently on loading, becomes increasingly more dif-
ﬁcult to satisfy. Already with 2 scales, we ﬁnd that one needs to rely on
the loading process to ﬁnd ”complete” (simply connected) contact over the
contact area. The ampliﬁcation factor above could however be considered an
upper bound, which could be reached upon suﬃcient pre-loading. Adhesion
will certainly show pressure-sensitivity.

3.3. Kesari’s envelope validity

We have obtained the ampliﬁcation factors under the implicit assumptions
that Kesari’s envelope works. In the single scale waviness of Guduru, this
was true for low values of βG = λ3E ∗
2πwR2 . Here, we can deﬁne a scale-dependent
βn looking at the scale n and the waviness at scale n + 1,

βn =

(23)

which rapidly goes to zero only for low fractal dimensions, and this suggests
the Kesari envelope is increasingly more appropriate for this, most important
case. Therefore, at least this assumption is not particularly restrictive.

4. Conclusions

We have attempted to extend the Guduru model to multiscale roughness,
using a Weierstrass series. We found some estimates of the potential ampli-
ﬁcation, which is higher than that of the single scale of waviness. We ﬁnd
in particular that the potential ampliﬁcation is bounded for D < 1.5 and
is unbounded otherwise. However, many limitations suggest this ampliﬁca-
tion is often impractical to reach: the assumption of JKR regime becomes
increasingly invalid for ﬁner scales, the monotonicity of the proﬁle, needed to
guarantee simply connected contact area, is also very unpractical to reach,
and the highest ampliﬁcations occur exactly where the assumption of a simply
connected area is most diﬃcult to satisfy. Finally, a true 1D or axisymmetric
roughness is less common than random roughness, although one can contrive
some systems to wrinkle only in one direction and therefore it is not uncon-
ceivable. When the roughness is random, this further reduces the expected
ampliﬁcations.
