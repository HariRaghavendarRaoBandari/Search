ABSTRACT

Context. We present an automated procedure that derives simultaneously the eﬀective temperature Teﬀ, the surface gravity log g, the
metallicity [Fe/H], and the equatorial projected rotational velocity v sin i for "normal" A and Am stars. The procedure is based on the
principal component analysis inversion method of Paletou et al. (2015a).
Aims. A sample of 322 high resolution spectra of F0-B9 stars, retrieved from the Polarbase, SOPHIE, and ELODIE databases, were
used to test this technique with real data. We have selected the spectral region from 4400-5000Å as it contains many metallic lines
and the Balmer Hβ line.
Methods. Using 3 datasets at resolving powers of R=42 000, 65 000 and 76 000, about ∼ 6.6×106 synthetic spectra were calculated to
build a large learning database. The Online Power Iteration algorithm was applied to these learning datasets to estimate the principal
components (PC). The projection of spectra onto the few PCs oﬀered an eﬃcient comparison metric in a low dimensional space. The
spectra of the well known A0- and A1-type stars, Vega and Sirius A, were used as control spectra in the three databases. Spectra of
other well known A-type stars were also employed in order to characterize the accuracy of the inversion technique.
Results. All observational spectra were inverted and atmospheric parameters derived. After removal of a few outliers, the PCA-
inversion method appears to be very eﬃcient in determining Teﬀ, [Fe/H], and v sin i for A/Am stars. The derived parameters agree
very well with previous determinations. Using a statistical approach, deviations of around 150 K, 0.35 dex, 0.15 dex, and 2 km/s were
found for Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], and v sin i with respect to literature values for A-type stars.
Conclusions. The PCA-inversion proves to be a very fast, practical, and reliable tool for estimating stellar parameters of FGK and A
stars, and deriving eﬀective temperatures of M stars.

1. Introduction
Sky and ground-based surveys can produce hundreds of ter-
abytes (TB) up to 100 (or more) petabytes (PB) both in the im-
age data archive and in the object catalogs (Borne 2013). For
instance, the ESA space mission Gaia (Perryman et al. 2001),
launched in December 2013, is expected to produce a ﬁnal
archive of about 1 PB (1015 Bytes) through 5 years of explo-
ration. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project
will conduct a 10-year survey of the sky that will deliver about
15 terabytes (TB) of raw data per night (Kantor et al. 2007). The
total amount of data collected over the ten years of operation will
be 60 PB, and processing these data will produce a 15 PB cata-
log database. The need for methods that can handle and analyze
this large amount of information becomes evident.

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used
to invert stellar spectra in order to determine stellar fundamen-
tal parameters of stars (Bailer-Jones et al. 1998; Re Fiorentin
et al. 2007; Paletou et al. 2015a,b). This technique has proven
to be a fast and reliable tool to invert observed high-resolution
spectra. Unlike classical techniques such as least-square ﬁtting,

(cid:63) Based on data retrieved from the Polarbase, SOPHIE, and ELODIE

archives

PCA is based on a dimensionality reduction for the fast search
of the nearest neighbour of an observed spectrum in a learning
database. This technique can become obviously advantageous
when dealing with large number of extended spectra collected at
various spectral resolutions during sky surveys such as the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000), the RAdial Ve-
locity Experiment (RAVE; Steinmetz 2003; Munari et al. 2005),
and more recently the Gaia ESO Survey (GES; Gilmore et al.
2012).

A description of the PCA-based inversion technique for stel-
lar parameters that we shall use can be found in Paletou et al.
(2015a), where the authors applied this technique to derive fun-
damental parameters from high-resolution spectra of FGK stars.
Paletou et al. (2015b) have shown that the range of application
of the principal component analysis-based inversion method can
be extended to dwarf M stars in order to derive eﬀective temper-
atures.

In the present work, we extend the work of Paletou et al.
(2015a) to A-type stars whose eﬀective temperatures range be-
tween 7 000 and 10 000 K. A large variety of physical processes
are at play in the envelopes of A/Am stars. Chemical peculiarity
and pulsation are observed among main-sequence A and F stars.
Chemical peculiarity is a signature of the occurrence of trans-

port processes competing with radiative diﬀusion (Zahn 2005;
Richer et al. 2000; Richard et al. 2001, 2002; Vick et al. 2010).
Chemical peculiarity exist in diﬀerent ways in A-type stars (Am,
Ap, λ Bootis stars. . .). These peculiarities set constraints on self-
consistent evolutionary models of these objects including vari-
ous particle transport processes (Gebran et al. 2008; Gebran &
Monier 2008; Gebran et al. 2010). The stellar atmospheric pa-
rameters are the prerequisites to any detailed abundance analy-
sis, and for that reason, these parameters should be derived with
good accuracy.
To do so, we have calculated around 6.6×106 synthetic spec-
tra and used them as three learning databases. These synthetic
spectra were compared to a collection of observed spectra in or-
der to ﬁnd the best global ﬁt between the two sets. The A-type
stars spectra that we analyzed in the present work were selected
from the PolarBase1 (Petit et al. 2014) stellar library at two dif-
ferent resolutions (R ∼ 65 000 and R ∼ 76 000), and from the
SOPHIE2 and ELODIE3 archives (Moultaka et al. 2004) (R ∼
75 000 and 42 000, respectively). We have restricted our study to
the wavelength range 4400-5000 Å. In this region, free from tel-
luric lines, we can ﬁnd many metallic lines and mostly many iron
transitions (Fe i and Fe ii) with accurate atomic data. The Balmer
line Hβ around ∼4860 Å is also present in this spectral range.
As mentioned by Smalley (2005), the advantage of the global
spectral ﬁtting technique is that it can be automated for a very
large number of stellar observations. It can also be used for low
resolution spectra or spectra of fast rotators where line blending
is important (v sin i can go up to 300 km s−1 for A-type stars).
Dealing with large multi-dimensional grid of synthetic spectra,
the combination of the metallic and Balmer lines is essential for
the derivation of the eﬀective temperature Teﬀ, surface gravity
log g, metallicity [Fe/H], and projected equatorial rotational ve-
locity v sin i (Smalley 2005).

Due to their sensitivity to eﬀective temperature and surface
gravity, hydrogen line proﬁles should be included in all auto-
matic procedures based on spectral ﬁtting to obtain realistic at-
mospheric parameters for stars hotter than 5 500 K (Ryabchikova
et al. 2015). The Balmer lines in B to F stars are in general well
matched by LTE computations, and they are practically identical
to the non-LTE predictions (Przybilla & Butler 2004). The re-
gion around Hβ was chosen because it harbors several iron lines
having accurate atomic parameters. The Balmer lines provide an
excellent diagnostic of Teﬀ for stars cooler than ∼8 000 K (Gray
1992; Heiter et al. 2002). For stars hotter than 8 000 K, Balmer
line proﬁles, in particular their wings, are sensitive to both tem-
perature and gravity (Gray 1992; Smalley 2005). Metal line di-
agnostics are also a good indicators of Teﬀ, log g, and [Fe/H] as
the best ﬁt synthetic spectrum will correspond to the one that
yields the same abundance for diﬀerent ionization stages of the
same element (Ionization Balance) and in the same abundance
for all excitation potentials of the same element in a given ioniza-
tion stage (Excitation Potential). On the other hand, lines such as
the Mg ii triplet around 4481 Å and the Fe ii lines between 4500
and 4530 Å, are excellent indicators of v sin i (see for example
Royer et al. 2014). For all the above mentioned reasons, we have
applied the global spectral ﬁtting technique to the whole spec-
tral range from 4400 and 5000 Å. The derived parameters are
obviously model dependent, but the models that we are using
(Sec. 2.2) are well suited for describing the atmospheres and the
spectra of "normal" A and Am stars.

The selection of the observed spectra and the construction of
the learning databases are detailed in Sec. 2. The Principal Com-
ponent Analysis and the derivation of the eigenvectors and the
coeﬃcients are recalled in Sec. 3. Radial velocity correction and
re-normalization of the spectra are discussed in Sec. 4. The re-
sults of the inversion are presented in Sec. 5. A few outliers have
been analyzed in details in Sec. 6. Discussion and conclusion are
gathered in Sec. 7.

2. Observations and learning database
2.1. Target selection

The PolarBase contains reduced stellar spectra collected with the
NARVAL and ESPaDOnS high-resolution spectropolarimeters.
These two spectropolarimeters are mounted on the 2 m aper-
ture Télescope Bernard Lyot (TBL) in France and on the 3.6 m
aperture CFHT telescope in Hawaii, respectively. Both instru-
ments have a spectral resolving power of 65 000 in polarimetric
mode and 76 000 when used for classical spectroscopy. As a ﬁrst
step, we have selected all high resolution Echelle spectra of stars
whose spectral type ranges from F0 up to B9 from the database
at two diﬀerent resolutions and in spectroscopy mode only. Fifty
spectra were thus retrieved.

We have also retrieved A-type stars spectra from the
ELODIE and SOPHIE archives. These archives are on-line
databases of high-resolution Echelle spectra and radial veloci-
ties. ELODIE is a ﬁber-fed cross-dispersed Echelle spectrograph
that was attached to the 1.93-m telescope at OHP (Baranne et
al. 1996). It recorded in a single exposure a spectrum extending
from 3850 Å to 6811 Å at a resolving power of about 42 000 on
a relatively small CCD (1024 × 1024). SOPHIE is the Echelle
spectrograph mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Obser-
vatoire de Haute-provence (OHP) since September 2006. SO-
PHIE spectra stretch from 3870 to 6940 Å in 39 orders with
two diﬀerent spectral resolutions: the high resolution mode HR
(R∼75 000) and the high eﬃciency mode HE (R=39 000). All
the observations that we used in this work were observed in the
HR mode at the same resolution of NARVAL spectra. Spectra
of 279 stars, with signal to noise ratio larger than 100, were
downloaded from the SOPHIE and ELODIE archives.Overall,
we have selected 322 stars for our study. The identiﬁcations of
the selected stars are collected in Tab. 2. These data correspond
to PolarBase, ELODIE, and SOPHIE spectra, respectively. In-
verted eﬀective temperatures, surface gravities, projected equa-
torial rotational velocities, metallicities, and radial velocities are
collected in this table (see Sec. 5).

2.2. Learning database

The learning database was constructed using synthetic spectra
as done in Paletou et al. (2015b). Three sets of grids were used,
one at a resolution of 65 000, one at 76 000, and one at 42 000,
corresponding to the resolution of Polarbase, ELODIE and SO-
PHIE spectra respectively. These 3 grids are identical in terms
of the parameters (Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], v sin i, ξt), only the reso-
lution diﬀers. Line-blanketed ATLAS9 model atmospheres (Ku-
rucz 1992) were calculated for the purpose of this work. AT-
LAS9 models are LTE plane parallel and assume radiative and
hydrostatic equilibrium. This ATLAS9 version uses the Opacity
Distribution Function (ODF) of Castelli & Kurucz (2003). We
have included convection in the atmospheres of stars cooler than
8500 K. Convection was treated using a mixing length parame-

ter of 0.5 for 7000 K≤Teﬀ≤ 8500 K, and 1.25 for Teﬀ≤7000 K
following Smalley’s (2004) prescriptions.
The grid of synthetic spectra was computed using SYN-
SPEC48 (Hubeny & Lanz 1992). The eﬀective temperatures of
the model atmospheres range from 6 800 and 11 000 K with a
step of 100 K, and logarithm of surface gravities between 2.0
and 5.0 with a step of 0.1 dex, respectively. The projected equa-
torial rotational velocities v sin i were varied from 0 up to 300
km s−1 with a non-constant step (2, 5, and 10 km s−1), metallic-
ity was scaled from -2.0 dex up to +2.0 dex with respect to the
Grevesse & Sauval (1998) solar value with a step of 0.1 dex.
The synthetic spectra were computed from 4400 Å up to 5000
Å with a wavelength step of 0.05 Å. This range contains many
moderate and weak metallic lines in diﬀerent ionization stage.
These weak metallic lines (indicators for v sin i and [Fe/H]) and
the Balmer line (indicator for Teﬀ and log g) are not sensitive
to small changes of the microturbulent velocity. For that reason,
we have ﬁxed the microturbulent velocity (ξt) to 2.0 km s−1in all
models. This value corresponds to the average microturbulent
velocity in A-type stars (Gebran et al. 2014). The linelist used
in the synthetic spectra calculation was constructed from Ku-
rucz gfhyperall.dat4 and modiﬁed with more recent and accurate
atomic data retrieved from the VALD5 and the NIST6 databases.
At each resolution, we ended up with ∼ 2.2 million spectra as a
learning database.

3. Principal Component Analysis
Our usage of the PCA for the inversion process is inﬂuenced by
the work of Rees et al. (2000) and Paletou et al. (2015a,b). As
mentioned in Sec. 1, the PCA is a reduction of dimensionality
technique that retains as much as possible the variation present
in the data set (Jolliﬀe 1986). It searches for basis vectors that
represent most of the variance in a given database. The reduc-
tion of dimensionality allowed by the PCA is directly used to
build a speciﬁc metric from which a nearest-neighbour(s) search
is made between an observed data set (observed spectra in the
present work) and the content of a learning database (synthetic
spectra in the present work). The learning database could be con-
structed using a set of observed spectra with well known param-
eters (Paletou et al. 2015a). The PCA becomes mainly advanta-
geous when dealing with high- and low-resolution spectra that
cover a very broad bandwidth as the reduction of dimensionality
will allow a very fast processing of the data. In what follows, we
describe the characteristics of this technique in the context of our
study.

3.1. Nearest neighbour search
Representing the learning database in a matrix S of size Nspectra =
2.2 × 106 by Nλ = 12000, ¯S will be the average of S along
the Nspectra-axis. Then, we derive the eigenvectors ek(λ) of the
variance-covariance matrix C deﬁned as

C = (S − ¯S)T · (S − ¯S)

(1)
and having a dimension of Nλ × Nλ. These eigenvectors of
the symmetric C matrix are then sorted in decreasing eigenval-
ues magnitude; they are more usually referred to as “principal

components”. Each spectrum of the dataset S is represented by a
small number of coeﬃcients p jk deﬁned as
p jk = (S j − ¯S ) · ek
The main point of reducing the dimensionality is the selection of
kmax (cid:28) Nλ. We show in Sec. 3.2 that kmax = 12 is a reasonable
choice.

(2)

To follow the same notation as in Paletou et al. (2015a), we
denote the observed spectrum by O(λ) having the same wave-
length range and sampling as the learning dataset spectra. At this
stage, the observations should be corrected for radial velocity
(details in Sec. 4). We compute the set of projection coeﬃcients
k deﬁned as
k = (O − ¯S ) · ek
The nearest neighbour is then found by minimizing a χ2 in the
low dimensional space of the coeﬃcients

(3)

= Σkmax

k=1 (k − p jk)2,

(4)

where j covers the number of synthetic spectra. The parameters
of the synthetic spectrum having the minimum d will be consid-
ered for the inversion.

3.2. Power Iteration method
The derivation of the leading eigenvectors of C is the most crit-
ical step when performing PCA, and it becomes increasingly
time consuming as the size of learning dataset increases. Further-
more, techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD)
that were used in previous studies, become inapplicable in this
case due to computer memory shortage. In our particular case, at
each of the three resolutions, the ﬁles containing the matrix S are
≈ 240 GB in size. To bypass this problem, we have used an algo-
rithm that is applicable independently of the size of the dataset.
We have implemented the Online Power Iteration algorithm (also
called Von Mises iteration, Demmel 1997) to estimate the kmax
principal components of the dataset S. This algorithm reads and
operates on synthetic spectra of the learning dataset one by one,
avoiding loading all the data at once. The procedure, moreover,
does not need any typical matrix factorization such as SVD, and
is eﬃcient when applied to large datasets (Roweis 1998). The
procedure consists of the following:

First we ﬁnd the eigenvector e1 with a maximal eigenvalue

λ1 (i.e. the ﬁrst principal component), by iterating

xn+1 =

Cxn
||Cxn|| ,

(5)

with an initial random non-zero vector x0. Practically Cxn cannot
be computed using standard technique as one should load the full
dataset S at once to calculate C. To overcome this problem, we
evaluate "Cxn" for each iteration on xn while operating on each
spectrum at a time by performing:
Cxn = (S − ¯S )T (S − ¯S ) · xn

Nspectra(cid:88)

=

((S i − ¯S ) · xn) · (S i − ¯S )

(6)

5 http://www.astro.uu.se/~vald/php/vald.php
6 http://physics.nist.gov

where S i is the ith spectrum in the dataset S. The xn iterations
converge to the eigenvector e1 that corresponds to the largest
eigenvalue.

(8)

Once we ﬁnd a good approximation for e1, we perform the
Gram-Schmidt process in order to remove the contribution of e1
from S by doing:
S1 = S − [(S − ¯S ) · e1]e1
Again, the above should be done iteratively over each spectrum.
Next, to compute e2, the power method (Eq. 5) is performed on
C1 = (S1 − ¯S )T · (S1 − ¯S )
Once e2 is estimated, the Gram-Schmidt process is applied again
to yield:
S2 = S1 − [(S1 − ¯S ) · e2]e2
And so on until we compute all the needed eigenvectors. To
determine the optimal number of iterations needed for the
derivation of the eigenvectors, we have constructed several
smaller databases and derived their respective eigenvectors
using the SVD technique and the Power Iteration. For each
database, the derived eigenvectors from both techniques were
compared. Using Power Iteration, 25 iterations were required
to reach a relative diﬀerence between eigenvectors smaller
than 0.1%. The use of the Power Iteration in this present work
allowed the increase of the number of spectra in the learning
database by a factor of 10 (200 000 in case of the SVD to 2 200
000 in case of Power Iteration).

(9)

wavelength of the Fe ii lines in the 4500-4550 Å region are ac-
curately measured to within ∼ 0.01 Å according to the NIST
database. For that reason, the selected template corresponds to a
typical A5V type star.

4.2. Renormalization of the ﬂux
On the other hand, we also noticed that the ﬂux normalization
procedure is critical in this work and that an improper normal-
ization could aﬀect drastically the derived parameters. In order
to correct for this eﬀect, we have proceeded using Gazzano et al.
(2010)’s procedure. Each originally normalized observed spec-
trum was divided by the synthetic spectrum calculated with the
ﬁrst inverted atmospheric parameters (Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], and
v sin i). The residuals were then cleaned from lines with a sigma
clipping, rejecting points above or below 1 σ. The remaining
points were ﬁtted with a second degree polynomial. The obser-
vation was then divided by this polynomial in order to obtain a
new normalized spectrum. This new spectrum was inverted again
in order to ﬁnd a new set of parameters. This procedure was re-
peated until the inverted parameters remained unchanged from
one iteration to the next. The number of iterations depends on
the original shape of the normalized observed spectrum. On av-
erage, 10 iterations were suﬃcient in order to reach convergence.
In Fig. 1, we show the application of Gazzano et al. (2010) pro-
cedure to the inversion of the spectrum of HD 97230. Only 8
iterations were required in this example.

Only the ﬁrst 12 eigenvectors were considered and that was
justiﬁed by the calculation of the reconstruction error of the
spectra deﬁned as

k=1 p jkek − S j|
S j

(cid:43)

E(kmax) =

(10)

Using only 12 eigenvectors, the average reconstruction error is
found to be smaller than 1%, a result similar to that derived in
Paletou et al. (2015a).

4. Preparation of the observed spectra
In order to adjust a synthetic spectrum to an observed one, lines
of both spectra should be aligned, as accurately as possible, on
the same wavelength scale and both ﬂuxes should be at the same
level. The later is achieved by rectifying the observed and syn-
thetic spectra to their local continua.

4.1. Radial velocity correction
A wavelength shift between observations and synthetic spectra
could aﬀect drastically the derived parameters of the ﬁrst neigh-
bour. Paletou et al. (2015a) showed that the radial velocity vr
should be known to an accuracy of c/4R, where c is the speed of
light in vacuum. This requirement translates into a velocity accu-
racy of ∼1 km s−1 needed at a spectral resolution of 76 000. We
have corrected all the spectra from radial velocity (given in the
last column of Tab. 2) before the inversion procedure. The radial
velocities were determined using the classical cross-correlation
technique originally described by Tonry & Davis (1979). The ob-
served spectra were cross-correlated using a synthetic template,
in the same wavelength range, corresponding to the parameters
Teﬀ = 8500 K, log g = 4.0 dex, [Fe/H]=0, and ve sin i = 0 km s−1.
Many of the Fe ii, Cr ii, Ti ii and Mg ii atomic lines are mainly
present in all sub-types of A-type stars (from A0 to A9). The

5. A stars spectra inversions
5.1. Vega and Sirius A
The ﬁrst tests were carried out using the two well studied A-
type stars, Vega (HD 172167, A0V) and Sirius A (HD 48915,
A1m). The spectra of Vega were retrieved from the PolarBase
and SOPHIE archive. The ESPaDOnS spectrum was inverted us-

ing the learning database at a resolution of 65 000 whereas the
SOPHIE spectrum was inverted using the database at a resolu-
tion of 76 000. Both inversions yielded the same results for all
parameters. We found for {Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], v sin i} values of
{9 500 K, 4.0 dex, -0.5 dex, 25 km s−1} whereas the medians of
the parameters found by querying Vizier7 are {9 520 K, 3.98 dex,
-0.53 dex, 23 km s−1}. The inverted parameters of Vega agree
very well with all previous determinations such as Takeda et al.
(2008), Hill et al. (2010), and the fundamental eﬀective temper-
ature derived by Code et al. (1976) from the integrated ﬂux and
the angular diameter. Figure 2a displays the overall adjustment
of 4 observed spectra of Vega with the ﬁrst neighbour synthetic
spectra. These spectra were observed at diﬀerent epochs. The
good agreement between the inverted metallicity and the pro-
jected equatorial rotational velocity of Vega with the catalogs
ones can be seen in Fig. 2b where we display the adjustment in
the region sensitive to these two parameters. The spectrum of

K, 4.2 dex, 0.2 dex, 18 km s−1} whereas the medians of the pa-
rameters retrieved from a Vizier query are {9 870 K, 4.30 dex,
0.36 dex, 15 km s−1}. This result is in very good agreement with
previous ﬁndings such as Hill & Landstreet (1993), Takeda et al.
(2009), and Landstreet (2011).

Table 2 displays the inverted parameters, the values that we
retrieved from Vizier queries closest to our inverted ones, and the
median of queried catalogs values. All literature data were col-
lected from Vizier catalogs using the ASTROQUERY8 Python
modules (Paletou & Zolotukhin 2014). We kept in this ta-
ble the inverted parameters for all selected stars in spite of the
fact that many of them may be variables or binaries. Using Sim-
bad queries, we have listed, in the last column of Tab. 2, the
peculiarity of the stars. Variables and binary systems were dis-
carded in the characterization of the technique (Sec. 5.2).

The eﬀective temperature is the only atmospheric parame-
ter which can be retrieved from Vizier queries for all stars but
for one exception. A small number of the selected stars do not
have catalogs values for log g, v sin i, and [Fe/H]. Figure 3 dis-
plays the inverted eﬀective temperature for each spectrum re-
trieved from Polarbase as well as the range in the eﬀective tem-
peratures retrieved from the catalogs (box-plots) and the median.
The number of values found in all catalogs retrieved in Vizier
for each star also appears in this ﬁgure. We found that the in-
verted parameters agree well with those retrieved in the various
catalogs. This agreement also applies to A-type stars spectra re-
trieved from ELODIE and SOPHIE archives (Tab. 2). However,
we found several outliers which are discussed in detail in Sec.6.
These outliers are depicted with a symbol "*" in Tab. 2. Figure 4
shows an example of an overall spectral ﬁtting between the ﬁrst
neighbour synthetic spectrum and the observation for several A-
type stars of our study.

5.2. Evaluation of the results and Comparison with literature

data

In order to evaluate the eﬃciency of our method, we have ﬁrst
removed from the analysis all peculiar stars such as Ae/Be,
Ap, variable (δ Scuti, γ Doradus variables. . .) and binary stars
(Eclipsing binaries, spectroscopic binaries. . .) as the models that
we are using do not take into account such peculiarities. AT-

Fig. 3. Comparison between our estimate of eﬀective temperatures (•), and the values we got from available Vizier catalogs, for PolarBase spectra.
The latter collections are represented as classical boxplots. Objects we studied are listed along the horizontal axis. The number of values found
among all Vizier catalogs are presented on a horizontal line around Teﬀ ∼ 4000 K. The horizontal bar inside each box indicates the median (Q2
value) while each box extends from ﬁrst quartile, Q1, to third quartile Q3. Extreme values, still within a 1.5 times the interquartile range away from
either Q1 or Q3, are connected to the box with dashed lines. Outliers are denoted by a “+” symbol.

LAS12 (Kurucz 2005) model atmospheres, dealing with Opac-
ity Sampling (OS), can better reproduce the distribution of the
thermodynamical quantities in the atmosphere of chemically pe-
culiar stars. Peculiarities of Am stars are not strong enough to
alter the temperature distribution in their atmospheres (Gebran
et al. 2008; Catanzaro & Balona 2012). For that reason, we are
conﬁdent that ATLAS9 can be used for moderate chemical pe-
culiarity.

We ended up with 182 classiﬁed "normal" A or Am stars.
To assess an automated and objective comparison with already
published values one may ﬁnd in Vizier@CDS, for instance, we
found reasonable to adopt speciﬁc weights for the set of values
we could retrieve for each object. These weights directly rely
on the spread of catalogued values. For some of the stars, dis-
persions in the catalogued values were noticed, and were severe
up to thousands of Kelvin for Teﬀ. As an example, HIP109119
has catalogued Teﬀ ranging between 5309 K and 8970 K. On the
other hand, some stars had only one or no catalogued values at
all for a particular parameter. This would deﬁnitely add a bias to
the error calculation. For that reason we have used a statistical
approach that gives less weight to stars having large spread in
the catalogued values. For a star i and a parameter ψ (ψ could
be one of the following parameters: Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], v sin i),
the diﬀerence between the inverted and the median from the cat-
alogued values of this parameter is weighted with the inverse
of the interquartile range (IQR). IQR is deﬁned as the diﬀer-
ence between the third and the ﬁrst quartile of each set of values

(IQR = Q3 − Q1). The deviation for the parameter ψ is derived

with wi derived for each star and each parameter as follow:

Stars with fewer than two catalogued value for a parameter ψ
were omitted in the calculation of ∆ψw because of the zero value
of their IQR. To estimate the parameters spread in the catalogued
values for the remaining stars, we have calculated the average
IQR as well as the standard deviation. We found that, on average,
the interquartile values for {Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], v sin i} are {550
K, 0.25 dex, 0.17 dex, 10.7 km s−1} with a standard deviations
of {1200 K, 0.35 dex, 0.23 dex, 15.5 km s−1}. These numbers
show that a large spread exists in the literature values, validating
our approach in using a weighted mean. Applying Eq. 11, the

standard deviations are summarized in columns 2 and 3 of Tab. 1.
Columns 4 to 11 of Tab. 1 display the absolute mean signed dif-
ferences and the standard deviations obtained by comparing our
inverted parameters to the median and closest ones from Vizier
query for all stars (Columns 4 to 7) and for the 19 reference stars
(Columns 8 to 11, see Sec. 5.2.1).

Effective temperature Teﬀ

Figure 5 displays the comparison between our inverted eﬀective
temperature and the catalogued ones for the 182 stars. The left
panel of Fig. 5 represents the comparison with the median of the
catalogued values whereas the right one displays the comparison
with the closest. There is a systematic trend noticed in the left
plot of Fig. 5. This is partly due to the large spread in the cata-
logued data. By comparing our inverted Teﬀ to the median value,
we obtain an absolute mean signed diﬀerence of 110 K with a
standard deviation of 630 K (Columns 4 and 5 of Tab. 1). All
stars (except HD322676) have at least two values for catalogued
Teﬀ. These catalogued eﬀective temperatures are based on dif-
ferent bibliographical references using distinct tools/techniques
for their determination. Using spectroscopy, one should expect
some diﬀerences between the derived eﬀective temperatures and
the ones determined using photometric techniques. The global
spectral ﬁtting that includes the Balmer lines provides an excel-
lent Teﬀ diagnostic for stars cooler than ∼8000 K because they
do not depend on gravity (Gray 1992). It follows that one part of
the diﬀerences between inverted and catalogued values is justi-
ﬁed for stars having Teﬀ>8000 K. For stars hotter than 8000 K, a
degeneracy could exist between the Teﬀ and log g. To overcome
this degeneracy, we have selected a wavelength range containing
many metallic lines as described in Sec. 1. When comparing our
inverted eﬀective temperatures with the closest catalogued val-
ues, the correlation becomes clearer (correlation coeﬃcient of
0.98). The absolute mean signed diﬀerence and standard devia-
tion are found to be, in that case, 13 K and 220 K, respectively
(Columns 6 and 7 of Tab. 1). Taking into account the spread of
catalogued data by applying Eq. 11, we found that on average
our eﬀective temperatures deviate of about 150 K from the cata-
logued ones with a standard deviation of 500 K (Columns 2 and
3 of Tab. 1).

Surface gravity log g

As mentioned in Sec. 1, the Hβ line is not sensitive to gravity
for Teﬀ≤8 000 K, which applies to about 60% of our sample.
For that reason we have expected that the global spectral ﬁt-
ting technique could derive incorrect log g values for these stars.
The most reliable log g values for A-type stars are determined
using photometric techniques, more precisely, from the uvbyβ
calibration. The photometric values of log g are not aﬀected by
metallicity (Smalley & Dworetsky 1993). By using a combina-
tion of spectroscopic and photometric techniques, the typical er-
rors on the atmospheric parameters of a star is ±100 K for Teﬀ
and ±0.2 dex for log g (Smalley 2005). The 0.35 dex weighted
average deviation and its corresponding 0.30 dex standard devi-
ation found in the present work (Columns 2 and 3 of Tab. 1), by
applying Eq. 11, are justiﬁed by the use of only spectroscopic
ﬁtting technique and by the insensitivity of the Hβ line to grav-
ity for Teﬀ≤8 000 K. Comparing our inverted log g to the median
of the catalogued ones, we found an unweighed absolute mean
signed diﬀerence of 0.40 dex with a standard deviation of about
∼0.60 dex (Columns 4 and 5 of Tab. 1).

Metallicity [Fe/H]
Catalogued values for metallicities exist for a small number of
stars and most of them have only one determination of [Fe/H].
Statistically, our comparison with catalogued values is not re-
liable in this case but the 0.15 dex that we derived using our
statistical approach (Eq. 11) is an average deviation for the de-
rived metallicities. The standard deviation in that case is 0.25 dex
(Eq. 13). These values are identical to the ones derived using the
unweighed diﬀerences (Columns 4 and 5 of Tab. 1). Comparing
with the closest catalogues values, these numbers are found to be
0.12 dex and 0.20 dex, respectively (Columns 6 and 7 of Tab. 1).

Projected equatorial rotational velocity v sin i
Most of the catalogued v sin i are based on the computation of
the ﬁrst zero of Fourier transform (FT) of Royer et al. (2002).
Our spectroscopic v sin i agree very well with previous ﬁndings
as shown in Fig. 6 where the comparison was done with the
median and closest catalogued values. We found a correlation
coeﬃcient of 0.96 between our inverted values and the median
ones from Vizier catalogs with a regression coeﬃcient (slope) of
0.98±0.02. The correlation coeﬃcient reaches 0.988 when deal-
ing with the closest values. By comparing one-to-one values be-
tween our inverted v sin i and the median of the catalogued ones,
we found an absolute mean signed diﬀerence of 5.0 km s−1 and
a standard deviation of 15.0 km s−1 (Columns 4 and 5 of Tab. 1).
Comparing with the closest values, the absolute mean signed dif-
ference is found to be 1.7 km s−1 with a standard deviation of
10.0 km s−1 (Columns 6 and 7 of Tab. 1). Taking into account
the spread in the catalogued values by applying Eq. 11 decreases
the average deviation to ∼2.0 km s−1 and the corresponding stan-
dard deviation to 9.5 km s−1 (Columns 2 and 3 of Tab. 1). This
result shows that the projected equatorial rotational velocities of
A-type stars can be derived with a small uncertainty using PCA-
inversion techniques.

5.2.1. Well studied A stars
We have also checked the deviation of our derived parameters
with the ones of some well studied stars. To do that, we have
selected all stars that have been studied extensively by diﬀerent
authors using diﬀerent techniques (photometric, spectroscopic
and/or interferometric). In the lack of a Benchmark stars list for
A stars (see for instance Blanco-Cuaresma et al. (2014) for a
list of FGK Benchmark stars), our selection of the well stud-
ied stars is based on the amount of references that we found
and the amount of derived values for each individual param-
eter for each star. Stars with existing photometric determina-
tions of Teﬀ/log g were also taken into account in our selec-
tion. We ended up with 19 stars having more than 120 refer-
ences each. The selected stars are Vega, Sirius A, HD 22484,
HD 15318, HD 76644, HD 49933, HD 214994, HD 214923,
HD 113139, HD 114330, HD 27819, HD 5448, HD 33256,
HD 29388, HD 91480, HD 30210, HD 32301, HD 28355, and
HD 222603. Considering these stars, and comparing our inverted
parameters to the median of the catalogued ones, we obtain an
absolute mean signed diﬀerence of 35 K with a standard devia-
tion of 250 K for Teﬀ, 0.18 dex with a standard deviation of 0.40
dex for log g, 0.09 dex with a standard deviation of 0.15 dex for

v sin i. These diﬀerences and standard deviations are displayed in
columns 8 and 9 of Tab. 1. The absolute mean signed diﬀerences
and their corresponding standard deviations decrease when com-
paring with the closest catalogues values (Columns 10 and 11 of
Tab. 1). These calculations also show that the eﬀective temper-
atures, metallicities, and projected equatorial rotational veloci-
ties of A stars can be derived with a good accuracy using PCA-
inversion techniques.

6. Outliers
The outliers have been selected based on the large diﬀerence be-
tween the inverted parameters and the values retrieved from the

Article number, page 8 of 16

catalogs. We have also considered as outliers, and checked in
detail, stars that were found to have very low metallicities. As
explained in Sec. 5, gravity is usually determined with poor ac-
curacy in spectral ﬁtting technique for Teﬀ≤8 000 K, but we are
conﬁdent that with our large wavelength range we are able to
reach realistic values for these stars due to the sensitivity of the
metallic lines to surface gravity (Ryabchikova et al. 2015). This
is justiﬁed by the small diﬀerences that we found between the
inverted and the median log g (Sec. 5.2). For that reason we have
decided to exclude gravity as a parameter for the outliers selec-
tion.

6.1. HD 6530:
Cowley et al. (1969) classiﬁed this star as A1V with no observ-
able peculiarity. Royer et al. (2014) suspected that this star could
be a binary system as the Cross-Correlation Function has an
asymmetric proﬁle. Figure 7 displays the proﬁle of several lines
in the SOPHIE spectrum of HD 6530. All lines have ﬂat cores.
More observations are needed in order to conﬁrm if HD 6530 is
a binary system or whether signatures of gravity darkening due
to fast rotation seen pole-on is present in the spectrum.

played in order to show the peculiar line proﬁle that could be due to a
binary system.

6.2. HD 12446:
HD 12446 has been classiﬁed as a kA2hF2mF2 star by Gray &
Garrison (1989) and is considered as a normal star in Simbad.
Eggleton & Tokovinin (2008) have found that this star is a mem-
ber of a binary system containing a A0pSi primary (V=4.16) and
an A9 secondary (V=5.27). The contribution of an Ap star and
an Am star to the spectrum probably accounts for the discrep-
ancy between the inverted parameters and those retrieved from
catalogs, especially for the projected equatorial rotational veloc-
ity.

6.3. HD 16605:
HD 16605, member of NGC 1039, is an A1-type star accord-
ing to Renson & Manfroid (2009). The magnetic ﬁeld of the star
was discovered by Kudryavtsev et al. (2006) having a longitu-
dinal component that varies from −2430 G to −840 G. Balega
et al. (2012) considered this star as an A1p with a peculiarity
of the type SiSrCr. They have also derived, spectroscopically,
an eﬀective temperature of 10 350 K and a v sin i of 13 km s−1
close to our inverted values of 10 800 K and 14 km s−1, respec-
tively. Their values were not found by querying Vizier, and hence
are not present in Tab. 2. Using interferometric data, Balega et
al. (2012) discovered that HD 16605 has a companion F star,
3.1 mag fainter, with an orbital period of 680 years. The fact
that HD 16605 is an Ap star with overabundances of Si, Sr, and
Cr could explain the large metallicity that we derived (1.1 dex).
As an A1-type star, the catalog median temperature of 8 000

K is clearly underestimated. ATLAS9 model atmospheres and
the spectrum synthesis used here do not properly account for the
eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic pressure is ignored
in the hydrostatic equilibrium when computing the atmospheric
structure in ATLAS9 and the Zeeman splitting of the line proﬁle
is not included in the line synthesis. For that reason, the PCA-
inversion technique presented in this work may not be applicable
for Ap stars using ATLAS9 and SYNSPEC.

6.4. HD 23479:

Classiﬁed as A7V, HD 23479 was suspected to be a spectro-
scopic binary by Liu et al. (1991). It has a visual companion in
the Tycho Catalog with separation 0".85, V=9.45, and B-V=0.54
according to Malkov et al. (2012). These authors also showed
that HD 23479 is a binary system containing a A7 + F6 star.
Our inverted Teﬀ and v sin i (7300 K and 2.0 km s−1) are in good
agreement with previous ﬁndings (7239 K and 0.0 km s−1). This
star was ﬂagged as an outlier because of the high iron abundance
(+2.0 dex). This large overabundance could be explained by two
contributors in the spectrum of this star, and as a spectroscopic
binary, our inverted parameters do not represent the fundamental
parameters of the components of HD 23479.

6.5. HD 50405:

According to McCuskey (1956), HD 50405 is classiﬁed as a A0
star in Simbad. Lefèvre et al. (2009) detected, in their prelimi-
nary work, a possible variability in HD 50405 of the δ Scuti type.
By carefully inspecting the NARVAL high-resolution spectrum
of HD 50405 in Fig. 8, we found a contribution of another com-
ponent. This star is a member of a binary system with a com-
ponent of probably a similar spectral type and should be classi-
ﬁed as such. The variation of the radial velocity between the two
components was found to be constant along the spectrum with a
value close to 170 km s−1. This strengthens the hypothesis that
the star is actually a binary. This star will be subject to a detailed
study in order to better characterize the system. The presence
of double lines is the reason of the discrepancies between the
inverted parameters and the catalogued ones.

6.6. HD 172271:

According to Simbad, this star is classiﬁed as A1 by Renson &
Manfroid (2009). Landstreet et al. (2008) detected a magnetic
ﬁeld of ∼260 G in this star and classiﬁed it as A0pCr. In their
paper, they derived a v sin i of about 107 km s−1 very close to the
100 km s−1 that we found from our inversion. Landstreet et al.
(2008) also derived the abundance of Cr and found an overabun-
dance of about 2.5 dex, while Fe is about 0.5 dex overabundant.
Their iron abundance is close to our inverted value of 0.4 dex.
The inverted parameters of HD 172271 were rejected because it
is an Ap star.

7. Discussion and conclusion
Using the Principal Component Analysis inversion, we have de-
rived the eﬀective temperature of "normal" A and Am stars with
an average deviation of ∼150 K with respect to the catalogued
values and with a standard deviation of 500 K. log g, [Fe/H] and
v sin i are derived with a deviation of 0.35 dex, 0.15 dex and 2
km s−1, respectively. Their standard deviations are 0.3 dex, 0.25
dex and 9.5 km s−1, respectively. This assessment was done us-
ing an automated and objective approach that takes into account
the large spread in the catalogued data.

We have also derived, for the ﬁrst time, the metallicity of
a large number of A-type stars. The combination of v sin i and
[Fe/H] is a very important parameter for a ﬁrst detection of the
Am phenomenon. It has been shown that for the same spectral
type, Am stars have lower projected equatorial rotational veloc-
ities than "normal" A-type stars and are usually slightly over-
abundant in iron (Gebran et al. 2008; Gebran & Monier 2008;
Gebran et al. 2010).

One could also use a learning dataset based on benchmark
stars with accurate stellar parameters. This could be possible
with large survey calibration such as Gaia. The Radial Velocity
Spectrometer (RVS) onboard of Gaia will collect about 15×106
spectra during its 5-year missions. The RVS will provide spectra
in the CaII IR triplet region (from 8470 to 8710 Å) at a spectral
resolution of ∼11 000. In case of A-type stars, the RVS wave-
length range contains the CaII triplet as well as N I, S I, Si I,
and the strong Paschen hydrogen lines that are a good indica-
tor of surface gravity at the temperature of A-type stars. Recio-
Blanco et al. (2015), using only 490 synthetic spectra as a learn-
ing database, showed that the parameters of A-type stars can
be derived with high accuracy in the RVS spectral range (see
Sec. 5.2 of their paper). In their work, they have compared the
performance of diﬀerent codes on the stellar parameters derived
from the RVS spectra. We intend to test the PCA-inversion tech-
nique in a similar manner, with a much larger database, to show
its eﬃciency at low resolution and in the RVS spectral range for
not only A-type stars, but also for late and early-type stars.

A preliminary work was published in (Farah et al. 2015)
where we have estimated stellar parameters of early type stars
observed in the context of the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES; Gilmore
et al. 2012). This survey collects observations of faint stars
(14<V<19) taken using the GIRAFFE/FLAMES spectrograph
at a medium resolution of R∼25 000. Two spectral regions were
used, one covering the Hδ line and one between 4400 and 4550
Å, similar to the wavelength range used in the present work. Al-
though the spectral resolution is low compared to those of the
SOPHIE or PolarBase spectra, we have derived stellar param-
eters in good agreement with those recommended by the GES
community.

Article number, page 10 of 16

As a conclusion, the work of Paletou et al. (2015a,b) and
the present one show that the PCA-inversion method proves to
be fast and eﬃcient for inverting stellar parameters of FGK and
A/Am stars and deriving eﬀective temperatures of M dwarf stars.
We have built a learning database containing 2.2×106 synthetic
spectra at each resolution. We have used for the ﬁrst time the
Power Iteration algorithm to derive the eigenvectors/Principal
Components of such a large database. The advantage of such an
algorithm is that it can be used whatever the size of the database
is. All the synthetic data have been calculated with a microtur-
bulence velocity of 2 km s−1. This parameter, in case of 1 D
models, should be considered with caution, especially when at-
tempting to model line proﬁles. One should modify this param-
eter in the learning database adopting the appropriate value for
the eﬀective temperature of the star. Gebran et al. (2014) de-
rived the dependence of ξt on the eﬀective temperature showing
a broad maximum around 8000 K. We are working on imple-
menting this equation in the calculations of learning databases
for F-A-B stars.
