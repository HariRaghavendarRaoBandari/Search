Coherent optical phonons in bulk solid system play a crucial role in understanding and designing
light-matter interactions and can be detected by the transient reﬂectivity measurement.
In this
paper, we demonstrate spectrally resolved detection of coherent optical phonons in diamond from
ultrashort infrared pump-probe measurements using optical band-pass ﬁlters. We show that this
enhances sensitivity approximately 35 times in measuring the coherent oscillations in the transient
reﬂectivity compared with the commonly used spectrally integrated measurement.

INTRODUCTION

Ultrashort optical pulses coherently excite phonons,
which oscillate in phase and modulate the macroscopic
electric susceptibility. These phonons are referred to as
coherent phonons and can be detected with another ul-
trashort pulse via intensity modulations in reﬂectivity
or transmissivity [1, 2]. Using coherent phonons and a
pump-probe type optical measurement, we can directly
observe the oscillation of the phonons and measure their
dynamics for a wide variety of materials such as semimet-
als [3–6], semiconductors [7–12], superconductors [13–15]
and topological insulators [16–19]. In addition, the co-
herent phonons in carbon materials, e.g., graphite [20],
graphene [21, 22], and carbon nanotubes [23–27], has re-
cently attracted much attention in studies of coherent
electron-phonon coupling.

To excite and measure the coherent phonons, the pulse
duration of the pump and probe pulse needs to be shorter
than the vibrational period of the phonons. This require-
ment corresponds to a spectral width of the optical pulse
that is much bigger than the phonon energy. The co-
herent phonon dynamics can be observed as a change
in transient reﬂectivity. While this change depends on

† yshikano@ims.ac.jp
‡ kayanuma.y.aa@m.titech.ac.jp

the probe light frequency, the reﬂected light can be mea-
sured without needing spectrally resolved methods. This
is commonly used and is referred to here as the spectrally
integrated detection. In contrast, the spectrally resolved
detection shows that the associated change in transient
reﬂectivity at shorter and longer wavelengths oscillates
180◦ out-of-phase mode [28–30]. This implies that the
sensitivity of the spectrally resolved detection is much
higher than that of the spectrally integrated detection
because the shorter- and longer- wavelength components
cancel each out through the quantum interference.

In this paper, we investigate enhancement of the detec-
tion sensitivity for the coherent optical phonons using the
spectrally resolved detection and found a strong enhance-
ment of approximately 35 times in diamond. Diamond
has a wide band gap (a direct gap of 7.3 eV and an indi-
rect gap of 5.5 eV) and a high optical-phonon frequency
(40 THz). Raman spectroscopy has been widely used to
extract properties of diamond because the phonon spec-
trum is sensitively dependent on the crystal structure of
carbon materials such as diamond, graphite, graphene,
and carbon nanotubes. Recently, as an application of
quantum memory, the dynamics of longitudinal optical
(LO) phonons in diamond has been studied [31–34]. On
the other hand, the coherent-phonon measurement us-
ing ultrashort visible pulses (photon energy 3.14 eV) and
spectrally integrated detection have recorded 40-THz co-
herent optical phonons in diamond and evaluated these
lifetimes based on the diﬀerence in impurity rates [35]. In
the present experiment, we used an ultrashort infrared

pulse with the central wavelength of 1.52 eV and ne-
glected linear and multi-photon absorption eﬀects, which
simplify the detection scheme to clearly demonstrate the
coherent-phonon dynamics.

The coherent optical phonons are investigated us-
ing a pump-probe-type transient reﬂection measurement
(Fig. 1). The output pulse from the Ti:sapphire oscillator
(FEMTOLASERs: Rainbow), the spectrum of which was
is given in Fig. 2 measured using an USB spectrometer
(OceanOptics: USB2000+), was divided into two pulses
by a 75/25 beam splitter, and used as pump and probe
pulses. The pump pulse went through a scan delay unit
(APE: Scan Delay 50) to control the time delay between
the pump and probe pulses. The scan delay was run
with the sine function of 20 Hz. Also, the probe pulse
was picked up by a 95/5 beam splitter to measure the
reference beam intensity at a photodiode (PD1). There-
after, both pump and probe pulses were focused on the
sample by using an oﬀ-axis parabolic mirror with a focal
length of 50 mm. The reﬂected pulse from the sample was
detected with a photodiode (PD2). In addition, optical
bandpass ﬁlters are put before PD2 for the spectrally re-
solved detection, which are FB740, FB800, FB850, and
FB900 (Thorlabs Inc.) having transmission at a central
wavelength of 740, 800, 850, and 900 nm, respectively,
with a band width of 10 nm. By applying the opposite
bias voltages to PD1 and PD2, we set the balanced de-
tection before the experiment. Its diﬀerential signal, to
be ampliﬁed with a low-noise current ampliﬁer (Stanford
Research Systems: SR570), was measured by a digital
oscilloscope (Iwatsu: DS5534). To reduce the statistical

error, the 32, 000 signals were averaged and taken as the
measured value. By converting the temporal motion of
the scan delay unit to the pump-probe pulse duration, the
temporal evolution of the reﬂectivity change ∆R(t)/R0
was obtained. The time interval of the sampling data
points was estimated to be 0.7 fs. Note that the spectral
chirping by the optics was compensated using a pair of
chirp mirrors to be conﬁrmed by the fused slica located at
the sample before the experimental procedures. The ul-
trafast laser conditions in the following experiment were
the spectral centroid 818 nm evaluated from Fig. 2, the
pulse width 8.9 fs from the frequency resolved auto cor-
relation measurement (FEMTOLASERS: Femtometer),
and the powers 20 mW and 14 mW of the pump and
probe pulses, respectively. The power and polarization
of both the pump and probe pulses were controlled using
a half-wave plate and a polarizer.

The sample was a commercially available type-Ib dia-
mond crystal of a [100] crystal plane (SUMITOMO Co.)
with a rectangular parallelepiped shape of face size of
5 mm × 5 mm, and a thickness of 2 mm. The polar-
ization of the pump pulse was set parallel to the [110]
axis. The polarizations of the pump and probe pulses
are orthogonal to each other.

III. COHERENT OPTICAL PHONONS

DYNAMICS IN DIAMOND

We next analyze the coherent LO phonon dynamics by
measuring the change in transient reﬂectivity. Figure 3
shows the transient reﬂectivity dynamics of the diamond
obtained for a whole spectral range without any ﬁlters.
With overlapping the pump and probe pulses there is a
strong peak at zero delay because of diamond’s nonlinear
response. After the strong peaks there is a modulation
caused by the coherent optical phonons in diamond. The
transient reﬂectivity expanded over the interval from 600
to 800 fs clearly indicates that the vibrational period is
25.0 ± 0.4 fs (frequency of 40.0 ± 0.6 THz). The am-
plitude of the oscillation was ﬁtted with a sine function

signal recorded over interval 600 fs to 800 fs

at 88 fs intervals and the lifetime was obtained by ﬁt-
ting the time evolution of the obtained amplitude with
a single exponential delay. The lifetime of this coherent
oscillation was estimated to be 6.1 ± 1.1 ps. This agrees
well with a previous result (5.59 ± 1.12 ps) [35].

Figure 4 shows the spectrally resolved transient reﬂec-
tivity change ∆R(Ω)/R0(Ω) with bandpass ﬁlters FB720,
FB800, FB850, and FB900. R0(Ω) is the reﬂectivity mea-
sured with a ﬁlter without the pump pulse. The ampli-
tude of the coherent oscillations in the transient reﬂectiv-
ity obtained with the bandpass ﬁlter is larger than that
without the band-pass ﬁlter, although the light intensity
obtained with the band pass ﬁlter is reduced. According
to the estimation of the current intensity at PD2, the
ratio of the reﬂected probe pulse intensity with BF900,
BF850, BF800, and BF740 compared with that without
ﬁltering is estimated to be 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.02,
respectively. We demonstrate that the oscillation am-
plitude in ∆R(Ω)/R0(Ω) with FB900 is 35 times bigger
than that without the ﬁlter ∆R/R0.

The phase of the oscillation on the longer-wavelength
side (850 nm and 900 nm) is almost opposite to that
on the shorter-wavelength side (740 nm and 800 nm).
This phase change in the transient transmission spec-
trum of carbon nanotubes was already reported [22]. The
phase of the coherent phonon oscillation in the diﬀeren-
tial transmission for the radial breathing mode of single-
walled carbon nanotubes depends on the detection wave-
length. The oscillations at wavelengths of 810 nm and
780 nm are anti-phase to each other, and hence below
and above the resonance of the E22 band gap. In con-
trast, in the present study, we observed a phase diﬀerence
in the transient reﬂectivity although all the probe wave-
lengths are below the band gap.

To elaborate a mechanism for our observed anti-phase
eﬀect, when a delay τp between the pump and probe
pulses is much longer than the optical pulse width σ,

the generation and the detection processes are treated
as independent. To clarify our observation in the spec-
trally resolved measurement, the detection process of the
coherent phonons is only discussed: an analysis of the
whole process is presented in Appendix A. The incidence
of the pump pulse on the diamond at time t = 0 in-
duces coherent optical phonons via impulsive stimulated
Raman scattering [2, 28, 38] because the optical energy
(1.52 eV) is well below the band gap (7.3 eV) of the di-
amond. The induced phonons modulate the polarization
of the crystal with a frequency ω after the pump pulse
passed away. When the probe pulse with frequency Ω ir-
radiates diamond at time t = τp > σ, a polarization P (t)
with synthesized frequencies of Ω and Ω ± ω is induced in
the diamond. The polarizations with frequencies Ω ± ω
oscillate 180◦ out-of-phase. Because the change in re-
ﬂectivity is obtained by integrating the electrodynamic
ﬁeld-energy rate E(t)∂P (t)/∂t [37], this also is 180◦ out-
of-phase.
It is noted that Ref. [37] gives a theoretical
treatment of the pump-probe signal in the transmission
process for optically thin systems. Essentially, the same
formula can be applied to the reﬂection process by re-
garding E(t) as the electric ﬁeld of the reﬂected probe
pulse without pump.

In the commonly-used transient reﬂectivity measure-

ments without ﬁlters, the oscillations at higher and lower
frequencies cancel out because they oscillate 180◦ out-of-
phase. While one may think that no coherent phonon
oscillation is observed without any ﬁlters, the oscillation
amplitude is proportional to the diﬀerence between the
electric susceptibilities, χ(Ω) − χ(Ω ± ω), and the elec-
tric susceptibility is an increasing monotonic function in
the transparent region encountered in Eq. (A21). In our
case, the higher frequency components can be observed
in the detection without any ﬁlter. The oscillation am-
plitude in ∆R(Ω)/R(Ω) with the speciﬁc ﬁlter is bigger
than that in ∆R/R0 without a ﬁlter. Our experimental
data shows that the sensitivity of FB900 band-pass ﬁl-
ter is 35 times higher than one without any ﬁlter. We
remark that the observed oscillations with FB900 and
FB850 are not perfectly 180◦ out-of-phase. This may
be caused by the spectral chirping in the optical pulse
while the Fourier-transform limited pulse was assumed
for simplicity in our theoretical treatment.

IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We observed the changes in the transient reﬂectivity
via coherent optical phonons in diamond using ultrashort
infrared pulses and showed that the spectrally resolved
detection can enhance the sensitivity of the coherent
phonon measurement approximately 35 times compared
with the commonly used spectrally integrated measure-
ment. This is because the reﬂected-light intensity for
higher- and lower-frequencies from the spectral centroid
is oscillated 180◦ out-of-phase and canceled each other
out.

By our enhanced method, we can measure the tran-
sient vibrational-state dynamics in a diamond more pre-
cisely, for example, the coherence time of the coher-
ent phonon. As alluded before [31–34], a vibrational
state of a diamond is a candidate of room-temperature
based quantum memory. By utilizing coherent opti-
cal phonons in diamond, coherent read-write process in
quantum memory might be demonstrated by a pump-
pump-probe method with a wave-packet interference of
optical phonons [39, 40].

Appendix A: Detection mechanism of coherent

phonons with spectral integration and resolution

In this appendix, the whole process of generation and
detection of the coherent phonons may be formulated as
a series of higher-order optical processes. The coherent
phonon is regarded as a tool to apply an oscillating per-
turbation on the electrons in the crystal, and the probe
pulse detects the change in the electronic states through
the modulation of the frequency dispersed signal. It is
noted that another quantum-mechanical treatment on
the generation and detection mechanism of the coherent
phonon was recently analyzed [41].

Let us consider a two-band system for the insulating
crystal, say diamond, which describes the dynamics in
the probe process. It is assumed that the energy to the
excited states is modulated by the coherent oscillation of
the LO phonon at the Γ-point, which has been generated
by the pump pulse. The model Hamiltonian is given by

Hk|kihk|,

H = Hg|gihg| +Xk
Hg = ωb†b,
Hk = ǫk + ωb†b − αω(cid:0)b + b†(cid:1) ,

(A1)

where the state vector |gi means the electronic ground
state of the crystal, and |ki the state that an electron with
wave vector ~k is excited from |gi to the conduction band
with the excitation energy ǫk. The Hamiltonian Hg and
Hk are the phonon Hamiltonians in the subspaces |gi and
|ki. The creation and the annihilation operators of the
LO phonon at the Γ-point with energy ω are denoted by
b† and b, respectively. A similar model has been used for
the generating phononic states in quantum dots [42]. It is
assumed that the excited states are coupled with the LO
phonon mode through the deformation potential inter-
action with the dimensionless coupling constant α(> 0).
In approximation, we have neglected the ~k-dependence
of the coupling constant, assuming a rigid-band shift be-
cause of the deformation potential interaction.
In the
bulk crystal, the Huang–Rhys factor α2 is considered to
be small; α2 ≪ 1. Within the rotating wave approxima-
tion, the interaction Hamiltonian with the probe pulse is
given by

HI = −Xk

µkE(t − τp)|kihg| + H.c.,

(A2)

in which µk is the transition dipole moment from |gi to
|ki, and E(t − τp) is the temporal proﬁle of the electric
ﬁeld of the probe pulse with the delay time τp. The
spectral proﬁle of the probe pulse is given by

E(Ω) = Z ∞

−∞

E(t − τp)eiΩtdt = eiΩτp E0(Ω),

(A3)

with

the integration of the spectrally resolved signal as

5

E0(Ω) = Z ∞

−∞

E(t)eiΩtdt.

(A4)

The interaction Hamiltonian (A2) can be used also for
the pump process by setting τp = 0. The only diﬀerence
is that the amplitude of E(t) is much larger compared
with that in the probe pulse.

If one neglects the reﬂection from the back surface of
the crystal, the pump-induced change of the reﬂection
is obtained as a heterodyne modulation on the reﬂected
probe pulse. Aside from irrelevant factors, the spectrally
resolved signal of the reﬂection [37] is given by

∆R(Ω) = Im {E(Ω)∗P (Ω)} ,

(A5)

where Ω is the detection frequency and P (Ω) is the
Fourier component of the polarization induced by the
probe pulse

P (Ω) = Z ∞

−∞

P (t)eiΩtdt.

(A6)

Equation (A5) can be derived from the argument that the
small change in the reﬂected amplitude of the probe pulse
originates from the loss or gain done by the work of the
induced polarization in the presence of a coherent lattice
oscillation. It can be easily shown that the spectrally in-
tegrated signal, which is obtained in the common pump-
probe experiment for the coherent phonons, is given by

∆R = Z ∞
= Z ∞

−∞

−∞

Im {E∗(t)P (t)} dt

Im {E∗(Ω)P (Ω)} dΩ.

(A7)

The actually observed change in the reﬂection is nor-
malized by the reﬂection amplitude R(Ω) without the
pump pulse. As R(Ω) ∝ |E(Ω)|2, we ﬁnd

∆R(Ω)/R(Ω) = Im {P (Ω)/E(Ω)} .

(A8)

For non-resonant excitation by the pump pulse, the co-
herent oscillation of the optical phonons is driven by the
impulsive momentum generated by the virtual transition
to the excited electronic states. We take the origin of
time at the moment that the displacement of the phonon
coordinate becomes maximum. Furthermore, we assume
that the initial conﬁguration of the phonon is given by
the coherent state deﬁned as

b|βi = β|βi,

(A9)

for a real eigenvalue β(> 0). While this is an approxima-
tion, it makes the whole calculation transparent. Hence,
the pump pulse prepares the initial state in which the
electron is in the ground state while the phonon is in the
excited state. For this initial state wave function

P op ≡ Pk µ∗

k|gihk|, the complex polarization at t is given by

P (t) = Tr {ρ(t)P op} .

(A12)

The ﬁrst-order polarization comes out from the cross term of the ﬁrst and the second term of Eq. (A12). The time-
evolution and the expectation value of the phonon variable can be calculated by elementary arithmetic using the
coherent state representation. We obtain

As a function of τp, the oscillating part are given by terms (m, n) = (±1, 0) and (0, ±1). As limx→0+ J0(x) = 1,

P (Ω) = eiΩτp αβ[{χ(Ω + ω) − χ(Ω)} e−iωτpE0(Ω + ω)

Because the electric susceptibility is a real quantity in the transparent region,

∆R(Ω) = αβ[{χ(Ω + ω) − χ(Ω)} Im{e−iωτpE0(Ω + ω)E∗
0 (Ω)}].

+ {χ(Ω) − χ(Ω − ω)} Im{eiωτpE0(Ω − ω)E∗

If the probe pulse is in the Fourier-transform limited, E0(Ω ± ω)E∗

0 (Ω) are real quantities and the above formula

∆R(Ω) = αβ[{χ(Ω) − χ(Ω − ω)} E0(Ω − ω)E∗

(A21)

For a frequency at the peak position of the incident
pulse Ω1, the peak frequency Ω2 in the reﬂected signal be-
comes Ω1 +ω in the ﬁrst term in Eq. (A21), and Ω1 −ω in
the second term. The phase of the oscillation is reversed
in both the high-frequency and the low-frequency parts.
Furthermore, the oscillation amplitude at high-frequency
peak is slightly larger than the lower one, because the
second derivative of the susceptibility is positive;

∂2χ
∂Ω2 > 0

(A22)

so that

|χ(Ω + ω) − χ(Ω)| > |χ(Ω) − χ(Ω − ω)|

(A23)

in the transparent region. Therefore, the change in tran-
sient reﬂectivity is not completely canceled out and can
be measured in the commonly-used spectrally integrated
measurement.
