(Dated: March 11, 2016)

A systematic investigation of octupole deformed nuclei is presented for even-even systems with
Z ≤ 106 located between the two-proton and two-neutron drip lines. For this study we use ﬁve
most up-to-date covariant energy density functionals of diﬀerent types, with a non-linear meson cou-
pling, with density dependent meson couplings, and with density-dependent zero-range interactions.
Pairing correlations are treated within relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) theory based on an
eﬀective separable particle-particle interaction of ﬁnite range. This allows us to assess theoretical un-
certainties within the present covariant models for the prediction of physical observables relevant for
octupole deformed nuclei. In addition, a detailed comparison with the predictions of non-relativistic
models is performed. A new region of octupole deformation, centered around Z ∼ 98, N ∼ 196
is predicted for the ﬁrst time. In terms of its size in the (Z, N ) plane and the impact of octupole
deformation on binding energies this region is similar to the best known region of octupole deformed
nuclei centered at Z ∼ 90, N ∼ 136. For the later island of octupole deformed nuclei, the calculations
suggest substantial increase of its size as compared with available experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

Reﬂection asymmetric (or octupole deformed) shapes
represent an interesting example of symmetry breaking
of the nuclear mean ﬁeld. The physics of such shapes
in the normal deformed minimum (both in non-rotating
and rotating systems) has been been extensively studied
in the 80ies and 90ies of the last century (see the review in
Ref. [1]). Reﬂection asymmetric shapes are also present
for large deformations at the outer ﬁssion barriers in the
actinides, superheavy nuclei and nuclei important in the
r-process of nucleosynthesis [1–3]. At present, there is
a revival of the interest to the study of such shapes.
It is seen in a substantial number of theoretical [4–17]
and experimental [18–26] studies of octupole correlations
and octupole deformed nuclei in the normal deformed
minimum. Moreover, the attempts to understand micro-
scopically the ﬁssion process, cluster radioactivity and
the stability of superheavy elements [2, 27–37] as well as
renewed interest to experimental studies of ﬁssion [38–
40] created a substantial interest in octupole deformed
shapes at large deformations.

The existence of octupole deformed shapes is dictated
by the underlying shell structure. Strong octupole cou-
pling exists for particle numbers associated with a large
∆N = 1 interaction between intruder orbitals with (l, j)
and normal-parity orbitals with (l − 3, j − 3) [1]. For
normal deformed nuclei not far away from beta stabil-
ity the tendency towards octupole deformation or strong
octupole correlations occurs just above closed shells at
particle numbers near 34 (the coupling between the 1g9/2
and 2p3/2 orbitals), 56 (the coupling between the 1h11/2
and 2d5/2 orbitals), 88 (the coupling between the 1i13/2
and 2f7/2 orbitals) and 134 (the coupling between the
1j15/2 and 2g9/2 orbitals) [1].

Some of the studies of the octupole shapes have been
performed in the framework of covariant density func-
tional theory (CDFT) [41]. Built on Lorentz covariance
and the Dirac equation, CDFT provides a natural incor-
poration of spin degrees of freedom [42, 43] and a good
parameter free description of spin-orbit splittings [43–45],
which have an essential inﬂuence on the underlying shell
structure.
In CDFT the time-odd components of the
mean ﬁelds are given by the spatial components of the
Lorentz vectors. Therefore, because of Lorentz invari-
ance, these ﬁelds are coupled with the same constants as
the time-like components [46] which are ﬁtted in time-
even systems to ground state properties of ﬁnite nuclei.
The ﬁrst investigation of the role of octupole defor-
mation in the CDFT framework has been performed in
Ref. [47]. In this work, the occurrence of stable octupole
deformation in the ground states of the Ra isotopes and
the impact of octupole deformation on ﬁssion barriers of
the 226Ra, 232Th and 240Pu nuclei has been studied with
the covariant energy density functionals (CEDFs) NL1,
NLSH and PL-40. However, because of some deﬁciencies
these functionals are no longer in use. During the last ten
years some extra calculations for the ground states of oc-
tupole deformed nuclei have been performed in the Ra
[13, 48], Th [12, 13], Ba [13, 49] and Sm [13, 50] isotope
chains. The choice of these nuclei have been motivated
by the results of the analysis of experimental data per-
formed in non-relativistic theories.

However, a number of questions are left beyond the
scope of these investigations. First of them is related
to a global survey of octupole deformed and octupole
soft nuclei in the CDFT framework across the full nu-
clear landscape. As mentioned above, existing CDFT
studies are very limited in scope. On the contrary, more
systematic surveys of octupole deformed nuclei exist in

non-relativistic models [6, 51]. The results of the macro-
scopic+microscopic (MM) approach of Ref. [51] cover all
nuclei with Z ≤ 108 from the proton-drip line up to
N = 160. On the contrary, the non-relativistic Hartree-
Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) studies with the Gogny force [6]
cover only regions of known nuclei.

The second question is related to the estimate of the-
oretical uncertainties in the description of octupole de-
formed nuclei. The importance of such estimate become
clear in the light of recent publications [52–56]. How-
ever, theoretical uncertainties in the description of oc-
tupole deformed nuclei have not been studied so far.
Such an estimate is not possible based on the results of
previous studies since they were performed either with
only one functional (PK1 in Ref. [50] for Sm isotopes,
NL1 and NL3 in Ref. [48] for 226Ra, DD-PC1 in [12, 13]
for Th, Ra, Sm, and Ba isotopes) or the studies for a
given nucleus or isotope chain have been performed in
diﬀerent frameworks (relativistic mean ﬁeld plus BCS
(RMF+BCS) in Refs. [48–50] versus relativistic Hartree
Bogoliubov (RHB) in Refs. [12, 13]) using diﬀerent pre-
scriptions for the pairing interaction.
In addition, the
choice of nuclei in these studies is quite limited (not ex-
ceeding six nuclei per isotope chain).

To address these two questions, we have performed a
global survey of all even-even Z ≤ 106 nuclei located
between the two-proton and two-neutron drip lines em-
ploying the DD-PC1 [57] and NL3* [58] CEDFs. Addi-
tional studies with the DD-ME2 [59], PC-PK1 [60] and
DD-MEδ [61] functionals are performed in the known
regions of octupole deformed nuclei and their vicinity.
This allows to estimate theoretical uncertainties in the
description of physical observables. In addition, the re-
sults of our investigation are consistently compared with
the ones obtained in the HFB approach with the Gogny
forces and, in particular, with the MM results presented
in Ref. [51]. This investigation is a continuation of our
previous eﬀorts to understand the accuracy and theoret-
ical uncertainties (and their sources) in the description
of the ground state observables [54], the extension of the
nuclear landscape [54, 55, 62] and the properties of su-
perheavy nuclei [56].

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
the details of the solutions of the relativistic Hartree-

Bogoliubov equations. The analysis of octupole defor-
mation in the actinides with Z = 86 − 106, N ∼ 136
is presented in Sec. III. Sec. IV contains the discussion
of octupole deformation in the A ∼ 146 mass region.
The impact of pairing strength on the relative energies
of quadrupole and octupole minima is discussed in Sec.
V. Sec. VI is devoted to the discussion of the impact of
the softness of potential energy surfaces on the rotational
properties of actinides. A global analysis of octupole de-
formation covering the full nuclear landscape for nuclei
up to Z = 106 is presented in Sec. VII. Finally, Sec. VIII
summarizes the results of our work.

II. THE DETAILS OF THE THEORETICAL

CALCULATIONS

The

calculations have been performed in the
Relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) approach for
which a new parallel computer code RHB-OCT has
been developed using as a basis the octupole deformed
RMF+BCS code DOZ developed in Ref. [2]. Only ax-
ial reﬂection asymmetric shapes are considered in the
RHB-OCT code. The parallel version allows simulta-
neous calculations for a signiﬁcant number of nuclei and
deformation points in each nucleus.

The calculations in the RHB-OCT code perform the

variation of the function

ERHB + Xλ=2,3

Cλ0(h ˆQλ0i − qλ0)2

(1)

employing the method of quadratic constraints. Here
ERHB is the total energy (see Ref. [54] for more details
of its deﬁnition) and h ˆQλ0i denote the expectation value
of the quadrupole ( ˆQ20) and octupole ( ˆQ30) moments
which are deﬁned as

ˆQ20 = 2z2 − x2 − y2,
ˆQ30 = z(2z2 − 3x2 − 3y2).

(2)

(3)

C20 and C30 in Eq. (1) are corresponding stiﬀness con-
stants [63] and q20 and q30 are constrained values of the
quadrupole and octupole moments. In order to provide
the convergence to the exact value of the desired multi-
pole moment we use the method suggested in Ref. [64].

Here the quantity qλ0 is replaced by the parameter qef f
λ0 ,
which is automatically modiﬁed during the iteration in
such a way that we obtain h ˆQλ0i = qλ0 for the converged
solution. This method works well in our constrained cal-
culations. We also ﬁx the (average) center-of-mass of the
nucleus at the origin with the constraint

< ˆQ10 >= 0

(4)

on the center-of-mass operator ˆQ10 in order to avoid a
spurious motion of the center-of-mass.

The charge quadrupole and octupole moments are de-

ﬁned as

Q20 = Z d3rρ(r) (2z2 − r2
Q30 = Z d3rρ(r) z(2z2 − 3r2

⊥),

⊥)

(5)

(6)

with r2
⊥ = x2 + y2. In principle these values can be di-
rectly compared with experimental data. However, it is
more convenient to transform these quantities into di-
mensionless deformation parameters β2 and β3 using the
relations

Q20 = r 16π
Q30 = r 16π

where R0 = 1.2A1/3.
These deformation parame-
ters are more frequently used in experimental works
than quadrupole and octupole moments.
In addition,
the potential energy surfaces (PES) are plotted in this
manuscript in the (β2, β3) deformation plane.

In order to avoid the uncertainties connected with the
deﬁnition of the size of the pairing window [65], we use
the separable form of the ﬁnite range Gogny pairing inter-
action introduced by Tian et al [66]. Its matrix elements
in r-space have the form

V (r1, r2, r′

1, r′

2) =

= −f Gδ(R−R′ )P (r)P (r′)

1
2

(1 − P σ)

(9)

with R = (r1 + r2)/2 and r = r1 − r2 being the center
of mass and relative coordinates. The form factor P (r)
is of Gaussian shape

P (r) =

1

(4πa2)3/2 e−r2/4a2

(10)

The two parameters G = 738 fm3 and a = 0.636 fm of
this interaction are the same for protons and neutrons
and have been derived in Ref. [66] by a mapping of the
1S0 pairing gap of inﬁnite nuclear matter to that of the
Gogny force D1S [67].

The scaling factor f in Eq. (9) is determined by a ﬁne
tuning of the pairing strength in a comparison between
experimental moments of inertia and those obtained in
cranked RHB calculations with the CEDF NL3* (see Ref.

3

[54] for details).
It is ﬁxed at f = 1.0 in the Z ≥ 88
actinides and superheavy nuclei, at f = 1.075 in the 56 ≤
Z ≤ 76 and at f = 1.12 in the Z ≤ 44 nuclei. Between
these regions, i.e. for 44 ≤ Z ≤ 56 and for 76 ≤ Z ≤ 88,
the scaling factor f gradually changes with Z in a linear
interpolation. The weak dependence of the scaling factor
f on the CEDF has been seen in the studies of pairing
and rotational properties in the actinides in Refs. [68, 69]
and pairing gaps in spherical nuclei in Ref. [54]. Thus,
the same scaling factor f as deﬁned above for the CEDF
NL3* is used in the calculations with DD-PC1, DD-ME2
and DD-MEδ. Considering the global character of this
study, this is a reasonable choice.

The truncation of the basis is performed in such a
way that all states belonging to the major shells up to
NF = 16 fermionic shells for the Dirac spinors and up
to NB = 20 bosonic shells for the meson ﬁelds are taken
into account (for details see Ref. [70]). Considering that
the calculations are performed in the vicinity of the nor-
mal deformed minimum, this truncation of the basis pro-
vides suﬃcient numerical accuracy. The potential energy
surfaces are calculated in constrained calculations in the
(β2, β3) plane for the β2 values ranging from −0.2 up
to 0.4 and for the β3 values ranging from 0.0 up to 0.3
with a deformation step of 0.02 in each direction. The
energies of the local minima are deﬁned in unconstrained
calculations.

The eﬀect of octupole deformation can be quantita-

tively characterized by the quantity ∆Eoct deﬁned as

∆Eoct = Eoct(β2, β3) − Equad(β ′

2, β ′

3 = 0)

(11)

2, β ′

where Eoct(β2, β3) and Equad(β ′
3 = 0) are the bind-
ing energies of the nucleus in two local minima of po-
tential energy surface; the ﬁrst minimum corresponds to
octupole deformed shapes and second one to the shapes
with no octupole deformation. The quantity |∆Eoct| rep-
resents the gain of binding due to octupole deformation.
It is also an indicator of the stability of the octupole de-
formed shapes. Large |∆Eoct| values are typical for well
pronounced octupole minima in the PES; for such sys-
tems the stabilization of static octupole deformation is
likely. On the contrary, small |∆Eoct| values are char-
acteristic for soft (in octupole direction) PES typical for
octupole vibrations. In such systems beyond mean ﬁeld
eﬀects can play an important role. They have profound
eﬀect on the spectroscopy of the nuclei, in particular, on
the E1 and enhanced E3 transition strengths [17, 71, 72],
and on the energy splittings of the positive and negative
parity branches of alternating parity rotational bands
[17, 73]. On the other hand, octupole beyond mean ﬁeld
correlations do not aﬀect in a signiﬁcant way the trends
and systematics of binding energies [74].

III. OCTUPOLE DEFORMATION IN

ACTINIDES

Several studies of the octupole deformation in the
ground states of actinides and its impact on spectro-
scopic properties of these nuclei have been performed so
far in the CDFT framework. The ﬁrst relativistic study
of octupole shapes in the ground states of atomic nuclei
has been performed twenty years ago in Ref. [47]; in this
manuscript radium isotopes have been investigated in the
RMF+BCS approach using monopole pairing with con-
stant pairing gap and the CEDFs NL1, NL-SH and PL-
40. Shape evolution from spherical to octupole-deformed
shapes has been studied in even-even Th isotopes in the
RMF+BCS framework in Ref. [5] using monopole pairing
with constant pairing gap and the NL3* and PK1 func-
tionals. Octupole deformed shapes in 226Ra have been
investigated earlier in Ref. [48] within the same approach
but with NL1 and NL3 functionals. The potential energy
surfaces and octupole deformations of the ground states
of even-even 222−232Th and 218−228Ra nuclei have been
studied in the RHB framework with the DD-PC1 func-
tional and separable pairing forces in Refs. [12, 13]. The
mapping of these potential energy surfaces onto an equiv-
alent Hamiltonian of the sdf interacting boson model
(IBM) allowed to determine its parameters. Then, the re-
sulting IBM Hamiltonian was used to calculate excitation
spectra and transition rates for positive- and negative-
parity states in these nuclei [12, 13]. Recently, ﬁrst gen-

erator coordinate method studies taking into account dy-
namical correlations and quadrupole-octupole shape ﬂuc-
tuations have been undertaken in 224Ra employing the
PC-PK1 functional [17]. They reveal rotation-induced
octupole shape stabilization.

It is clear that these studies were quite limited in scope
and the selection of nuclei was guided by the previous
studies in non-relativistic frameworks. A global review
of octupole deformed nuclei in this mass region paints
a much richer picture. Our RHB calculations indicate
that not only Ra and Th nuclei (as suggested by previ-
ous studies) can have either stable octupole deformation
or be octupole soft, but also U, Pu, Cm, Cf, Fm, No
and Sg nuclei possess these properties. The potential
energy surfaces obtained in the RHB calculations with
the DD-PC1 functional are shown in Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6,
8, 9, and 10 below for the nuclei in the Rn, Ra, Th,
U, Pu, Cm, Cf and Fm isotope chains. According to
previous global surveys of the performance of the state-
of-the-art CEDFs presented in Refs. [54, 56], this is one
of the best CEDFs. Neutron number dependencies of
calculated equilibrium quadrupole and octupole defor-
mations as well as the gains in binding due to octupole
deformation for these isotope chains are presented for ﬁve
CEDFs in Figs. 3, 7 and 11 below. For simplicity of the
discussion of the results and their comparison with avail-
able experimental data and other theoretical approaches,
they are discussed on the “chain-by-chain” basis in the
next subsections.

A. Discussion: theory versus experiment

1. Rn isotopes

No octupole deformation is predicted in the Rn iso-
topes of interest (see Table I). The potential energy sur-
faces are soft in octupole direction for the N = 136, 138
222,224Rn nuclei (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with the
analysis of experimental data presented in Refs. [20, 75]
which strongly suggests that the 218−222Rn isotopes be-
have like octupole vibrators, thus supporting the pres-
ence of a considerable octupole softness of the potential
energy surfaces.

The MM calculations of Ref. [76] with a Woods Saxon
potential suggest that only the 222−224Rn isotopes with
N = 136−138 have non-zero octupole deformation. How-
ever, the gain in binding due to octupole deformation is
rather small (∼ 100 keV). A wider range of octupole de-
formed Rn isotopes with N = 132 − 140 (with a max-
imum value of |∆Eoct| = 0.85 MeV at N = 134) and
N = 146 is predicted in Ref. [51] in MM calculations
with a folded Yukawa potential (see Table I). Ref. [77]
shows that at least 220Rn has non-zero octupole defor-
mation in the ground state in the HFB calculations with
the D1S and D1M Gogny forces. However, this is oc-
tupole soft nucleus with a relative small gain in binding
due to octupole deformation (|∆Eoct| < 0.25 MeV).

2. Ra isotopes

Potential energy surfaces of the Ra isotopes are shown
in Fig. 2. Weakly deformed minima with β3 = 0.0

are the lowest in energy in the 218,220Ra nuclei with
N = 130, 132. The increase of neutron number leads
to the formation of an octupole minimum which becomes
pronounced at N = 136, 138. At higher neutron numbers
the potential energy surfaces become soft in octupole di-
rection.

The maximum gain in binding energy due to octupole
deformation |∆Eoct| takes place at N ∼ 136 for the
CEDFs PC-PK1, DD-ME2 and DD-PC1 and at N = 138
for NL3* (Fig. 3). For these functionals the maximum
|∆Eoct| values vary from around 1 MeV for NL3* and
PC-PK1 up to 2 MeV for DD-ME2. The DD-MEδ func-
tional does not predict octupole deformation for the nu-
clei of interest which contradicts both to experimental
data (see Ref. [1]) and the predictions of other models
(see below).

Experimental data suggest that in the Ra isotopes
the maximum eﬀect of octupole deformation is seen at
N ∼ 136 [1]. For example, the N = 136 isotope has
the lowest energy of the 1− bandhead of the negative
parity band. There are some diﬀerences in the predic-
tions of the various models for the range of nuclei with
octupole deformation and for the neutron numbers at
which the maximum gain in binding due to octupole de-
formation takes place. For example, the MM calcula-
tions based on folded Yukawa [51] (see also Table I) and
Woods-Saxon potentials [76] predict octupole deforma-
tion in the N = 130 − 138 and N = 134 − 138 isotopes,
respectively. In these models, the maximum gain in bind-
ing due to octupole deformation takes place at N = 132
and N = 136, respectively. Note that the results ob-
tained with a Woods-Saxon potential are closer to ex-
perimental data [1]. The HFB calculations with the D1S

FIG. 4. (Color online) The same as Fig. 1, but for the Th isotopes.

Gogny force [78] and the Barcelona-Catania-Paris (BCP)
energy density functional [79] show that there exists non-
vanishing octupole deformation for the Ra isotopes with
N = 130 − 140 and with N = 130 − 142, respectively. In
both cases the maximum gain in binding energy due to
octupole deformation takes place at N = 134.

3. Th isotopes

The evolution of the topology of the PESs of the Th
isotopes is presented in Fig. 4 as a function of neutron
number. It is similar to the one discussed above for the
Ra isotopes. Well pronounced octupole minima exist in
the N = 136 and 138 Th isotopes.

The calculations with the DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 func-
tionals suggest that in whole region under study the Th
isotopes are characterized by the strongest octupole de-
formation eﬀects (see Fig. 3). However, this is not the
case for PC-PK1, where the octupole deformation eﬀects
are comparable in the Th and U nuclei, and for NL3*,
where they are more pronounced in the U isotopes. In
the Th isotopes the maximum of |∆Eoct| is located at
N = 136 for DD-PC1, DD-ME2, and PC-PK1 and at
N = 138 for NL3* (Fig. 3). The predictions of the DD-
MEδ functional disagree with all other model calculations
and experimental data.

Experimental data suggest that the maximal eﬀects
of octupole deformation in the Th isotopes are seen at

N ∼ 136 [1]. For example, the N = 136 isotope has the
lowest energy of the 1− bandhead of the negative par-
ity band. The MM calculations based on folded Yukawa
[51] and Woods-Saxon [76] potentials predict octupole
deformation in the N = 130 − 138 (see Table I) and
N = 132 − 138 (see Ref. [76]) isotopes, respectively. In
these models, the maximum gain in binding due to oc-
tupole deformation takes place at N = 132 and N = 134,
respectively. The results obtained with Woods-Saxon po-
tential are closer to experimental data [1]. The HF+BCS
calculations with the Gogny D1S force [78] predict oc-
tupole deformation in the ground states of the 222−228Th
nuclei with N = 132 − 138; the maximum gain in binding
due to octupole deformation is located at N = 132, 134.

4. U isotopes

The PESs of the U isotopes calculated with DD-PC1
are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 17 below. The spherical
minimum is the lowest in energy for the isotope 224U
with N = 132. The coexistence of spherical and octupole
deformed minima is clearly seen in the N = 134 and N =
136 isotopes. However, at higher neutron number the
potential energy landscape is dominated by an octupole
deformed minimum which becomes extremely soft above
N = 140. At and above N = 148 octupole deformation
vanishes and only a quadrupole deformed minimum is
present (see Fig. 17 below).

FIG. 5. (Color online) The same as Fig. 1, but for the U isotopes.

The maximum gain in binding energy due to octupole
deformation takes place at N ∼ 136 with |∆Eoct| ≥ 1.0
MeV for N = 134, 136 and 138 for DD-ME2 and PC-
PK1 and for N = 136 and 138 for NL3* and DD-PC1
(Fig. 3). Again, the results for DD-MEδ are in contradic-
tion with all other functionals and with experiment. An
alternative parity rotational band, indicative of static oc-
tupole deformation, is observed in the nucleus 226U with
N = 134 in Ref. [80]. The experimental data on 228U is
restricted to the ground and 2+ states [81]; so no decision
about the presence of static octupole deformation is pos-
sible in this nucleus. Octupole vibrational bands with 1−
bandheads, located at extremely low excitation energies
of 366.65 keV and 562.19 keV, are observed in 230U and
232U, respectively [81]. They are indicative of extreme
octupole softness of the potential energy surfaces.

The MM calculations based on diﬀerent phenomeno-
logical potentials and on diﬀerent liquid drop formulas
predict octupole deformed U nuclei at N = 128 − 134
(see Fig. 2 in Ref. [9]). In these calculations the maxi-
mum gain in binding due to octupole deformation takes
place at lower N as compared with CDFT. For example,
it is located at N = 132 (Table I) in the MM calcu-
lations of Ref. [51]. The HFB calculations with several
versions of the Gogny force show that the U isotopes with
N = 130 − 138 have non-zero octupole deformation [10].

5. Pu isotopes

The PESs of the Pu isotopes calculated with DD-PC1
are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 18 below. The spherical
minimum is the lowest in energy for the isotope 224Pu
with N = 130. The coexistence of a spherical (which is
the lowest in energy) and an octupole deformed minima
is clearly seen in the N = 132 isotope. A well pronounced
octupole deformed minimum exists in the N = 134 and
136 isotopes. However, at higher neutron number the

PESs become extremely soft in octupole deformation so
that the position of the minimum (ﬁnite octupole defor-
mation at N = 140 and 146 or vanishing octupole defor-
mation at N = 142, 144 and 148) depends on ﬁne details
of the underlying single-particle structure. Note that the
energy gain due to octupole deformation is very small for
N = 146, namely, less than 100 keV (Table I). The maxi-
mum gain in binding energy due to octupole deformation
is found at N = 134 for PC-PK1 and DD-ME2 and at
N = 136 for NL3* and DD-PC1 (Fig. 7). Only in these
isotopes the gain due to octupole deformation |∆Eoct| is
close to or exceeds 1.0 MeV. The results for DD-MEδ are
again in contradiction with all other functionals.

The predictions of CDFT diﬀer from those of the non-
relativistic models. The HFB calculations with Gogny
forces of Ref. [10] indicate that the isotopes 224−232Pu
with N = 130 − 138 have ﬁnite octupole deformations
in the ground states; the maximum gain in binding due
to octupole deformation takes place at N = 132. The
MM calculations of Ref. [51] predict octupole deforma-
tion only for the isotopes 222−228Pu (N = 128−134) with
a maximum gain in binding due to octupole deformation
at N = 130 (see Table I).

At present, it is impossible to discriminate between the
predictions of these models because of the limitations of
experimental data. Only the 0+ ground state has been
observed in the nuclei 228−234Pu with N = 134 − 140
(which does not allow to deﬁne the presence or absence
of octupole deformation) and no experimental data are
available for lighter Pu isotopes [81]. On the other hand,
octupole vibrational bands have been observed [81] in
the isotopes 236−230Pu (N = 142 − 146) with bandheads
located at low excitation energies of 698, 605 and 597
keV, respectively. This suggests a substantial octupole
softness of the potential energy surfaces of these nuclei.
Indeed, there are some indications of the stabilization of
octupole deformation at high spin in 240Pu [82, 83] (see
also Sec. VI).

6. Cm isotopes.

PESs of Cm isotopes are presented in Fig. 8. Spheri-
cal and weakly deformed minima are seen in the isotopes
224,226Cm with N = 128 − 130. The increase of neu-
tron number leads to the development of an octupole de-
formed minimum which becomes especially pronounced

in the nuclei 230,232Cm with N = 134, 136. With a fur-
ther increase of neutron number the potential energy sur-
faces become extremely soft in octupole direction. The
maximum of the gain in binding energy due to octupole
deformation (|∆Eoct| ∼ 1.0 MeV) takes place at N ∼ 134
for the NL3*, PC-PK1, DD-ME2 and DD-PC1 CEDFs
(Fig. 7). The results for DD-MEδ are in contradiction

9

with all other functionals.

The HFB calculations with Gogny forces of Ref. [10]
indicate that the isotopes 226−230Cm with N = 130 − 134
have non-zero octupole deformation in the ground states;
the maximum gain in binding due to octupole defor-
mation of around several hundred keV takes place at
N = 130. The MM calculations of Ref. [51] predict
octupole deformation only for the isotopes 224−228Cm
(N = 128 − 132) with a maximum gain in binding due to
octupole deformation (|∆Eoct| ∼ 0.8 MeV) at N = 130
(see Table I). Since experimental data do not exist for the
Cm isotopes with N ≤ 136 and only ground states are
observed in the nuclei 234,236Cm with N = 138, 140 [81],
there is no way to discriminate between the predictions
of the models.

ME2 and DD-PC1 show a similar evolution of ∆Eoct as
a function of neutron number (Fig. 11). The maximum
in |∆Eoct| is seen either at N = 134 (DD-PC1 and PC-
PK1) or at N = 136 (NL3* and DD-ME2);
its value
is located in the 0.5 − 1.0 MeV range. The results for
DD-MEδ diﬀer substantially from all other functionals.
The MM approach predicts octupole deformation only
in the N = 126, 128 nuclei (Table I) with rather modest
gains in binding due to octupole deformation. The maxi-
mum of |∆Eoct| is located at N = 128. The HFB calcula-
tions with Gogny forces show the presence of octupole de-
formation in the isotopes 230−232Fm with N = 130 − 132
[10]. No experimental data are available for the Fm iso-
topes with N ≤ 140 [81]. Thus, the predictions of diﬀer-
ent models cannot be discriminated.

7. Cf isotopes

9. No, Rf and Sg isotopes

The PESs of the Cf isotopes are displayed in Fig.
9. An unusual feature of the 224,226Cf isotopes with
N = 126, 128 is the presence of the minimum in the PES
with almost zero quadrupole deformation and octupole
deformation β3 ∼ 0.1. However, the PESs are soft in
octupole direction in 224Cf and both in quadrupole and
octupole directions in 226Cf. An octupole deformed min-
imum starts to develop in N = 132 230Cf and becomes
especially pronounced in 232,234Cf. A further increase of
neutron number leads to PES which are extremely soft in
octupole direction. The maximum of the gain in binding
energy due to octupole deformation (|∆Eoct| ∼ 1.0 MeV)
takes place either at N = 134 or at N = 136 for NL3*,
PC-PK1, DD-ME2 and DD-PC1 (Fig. 7). The results for
DD-MEδ are in contradiction with all other functionals.
The HFB calculations with Gogny forces of Ref. [10]
indicate that isotopes 228−232Cf with N = 130 − 134 have
non-zero octupole deformation in the ground states. De-
pendent on the functional the maximum gain in binding
due to octupole deformation of around 0.5 MeV takes
place either at N = 130 or at N = 132. The MM
calculations of Ref.
[51] predict octupole deformation
only for the isotopes 224−228Cf (N = 126 − 130) with
a maximum gain in binding due to octupole deforma-
tion (|∆Eoct| ∼ 0.6 MeV) at N = 128 (Table I). Since
experimental data do not exist for the Cf isotopes with
N ≤ 138 and only the ground state is observed in the
N = 140 238Cf nucleus [81], there is no way to discrimi-
nate between the predictions of the models.

8. Fm isotopes

For a given neutron number, the PESs of the Fm iso-
topes are very similar to the ones of the Cf isotopes (com-
pare Figs. 10 and 9). Thus, the discussion of the evolu-
tion of PESs as a function of the neutron number pre-
sented in Sec. III A 8 is also applicable to the Fm isotopes.
The results of the calculations with NL3*, PC-PK1, DD-

Our RHB calculations predict octupole deformed No,
Rf and Sg isotopes (see Table I). However, most of these
nuclei are octupole soft with marginal gains in binding
due to octupole deformation. In addition, there is a sub-
stantial diﬀerence between the NL3* and DD-PC1 func-
tionals. For example, only the N = 136 238No nucleus
is predicted to be octupole deformed in the calculations
with DD-PC1. On the contrary, the N = 134 − 140
236−242No nuclei are octupole deformed in NL3*. No
octupole deformed Rf nuclei are predicted in DD-PC1,
while the N = 138 − 142 242−246Rf nuclei have nonzero
octupole deformation in the ground states (Table I). Note
that the No, Rf and Sg nuclei with nonzero octupole
deformation are located at or near the two-proton drip
line (see Fig. 19 below) so their experimental observation
could be very diﬃcult. At present, no experimental data
are available for these proton-rich nuclei [81].

The MM calculations of Ref. [51] do not predict oc-
tupole deformation for the No, Rf and Sg isotopes. The
HFB calculations with Gogny forces of Ref. [10] predict
nonzero β3 values only in the 232−234No nuclei.

B. General observations

The analysis of the results of the RHB calculations
and the comparison between diﬀerent models reveal the
following general features:

• The results of the calculations are rather similar for
the CEDFs DD-ME2, DD-PC1 and PC-PK1 (see
Figs. 3, 7 and 11). The results with NL3* only
slightly deviate from the ones for these functionals.
Not only quadrupole and octupole equilibrium de-
formations as well as the gains in binding due to
octupole deformation displayed in Figs. 3, 7 and 11
show these features, but also the topologies of the
PESs, which aﬀect the results of beyond mean ﬁeld
calculations, are similar in these four functionals

FIG. 9. (Color online) The same as Fig. 1, but for the Cf isotopes.

(see Fig. 12). The predictions obtained with the
CEDF DD-MEδ contradict to all available model
calculations and to experimental data. Therefore,
the results obtained with this functional will not be
discussed in this subsection.

• In the RHB calculations with DD-ME2, DD-
PC1, NL3* and PC-PK1 a gradual
increase of
quadrupole deformation is typically seen in the
N = 130 − 140 range (see Figs. 3, 7 and 11). At
higher N value, the β2 deformation is nearly con-
stant.

• The center of the island of octupole deformation,
deﬁned in terms of maximum gain in binding due to
octupole deformation, is located at Z = 90−92 and
N = 136 in the RHB calculations with the CEDFs
DD-PC1, DD-ME2 and PC-PK1. This agrees with
the experiment [1] and with the results obtained
within the HFB framework based on Gogny forces
[10] and the MM calculations based on Woods-
Saxon potentials [76]. The MM calculations of Ref.
[51] with folded Yukawa potentials favor somewhat
lower neutron numbers N = 132 − 134. In these
calculations the neutron number N of the nucleus
with maximum gain in binding due to octupole de-
formation in a given isotope chain decreases with
increasing proton number Z down to N = 128 in
the Cf and Fm isotopes. A similar but less pro-
nounced trend is seen in the HFB calculations with
the Gogny forces. On the contrary, for relativistic
functionals this decrease is only 2 neutrons in going
from the Th and U isotopes to the Cf and Fm iso-
topes (see Figs. 3, 7 and 11). Thus, the CDFT pre-
dictions favor the experimental observation of these
octupole deformed nuclei as compared with non-
relativistic models since the island of octupole de-
formed nuclei is located closer to the beta-stability
line in the RHB calculations.
In particular, oc-
tupole deformed Pu, Cm, and Cf nuclei could be
within the reach of future dedicated experiments.

IV. OCTUPOLE DEFORMATION IN THE

BA-CE-ND-SM REGION

Octupole deformation is predicted also in the ground
states of the Ba, Ce, Nd and Sm isotopes. The results
for equilibrium quadrupole and octupole deformations
and the gains in binding due to octupole deformation
are summarized in Fig. 13.

Several features are typical for this mass region. First,
the gain in binding due to octupole deformation is sub-
stantially smaller (|∆Eoct| is typically around 0.5 MeV)
than in the actinides. Thus, the stabilization of octupole
deformation at the ground state is less likely in this re-
gion as compared with actinides.

11

Second, the results obtained with DD-MEδ still diﬀer
from the ones obtained with other functionals. However,
the diﬀerences are less pronounced as compared with the
actinides where the RHB results obtained with this func-
tional contradict drastically to experimental data and the
results of other functionals. One can also see in Fig. 14
that the topologies of the PESs obtained with the ﬁve em-
ployed functionals are similar; the only diﬀerence is the
fact that octupole minimum is somewhat deeper in the
DD-ME2 and DD-PC1 CEDFs as compared with other
functionals. Note that we will not discuss the details of
the results obtained with CEDF DD-MEδ in the follow-
ing.

In this mass region we focus on the presentation of the
RHB results and their comparison with non-relativistic
ones. In general, the island of octupole deformation pre-
dicted in the RHB calculations is close to the ones ob-
tained in non-relativistic calculations. Moreover, it is
close to the one extracted from experimental data indi-
cating either octupole deformation or enhanced octupole
correlations (see Ref. [1] for details). However, a detailed
interpretation of experimental data in this mass region
at the mean ﬁeld level is complicated by the fact that
PES are extremely soft in the octupole direction which
favors the ﬂuctuations and vibrations in this degree of
freedom. For example, expected parity doublets in odd-
mass nuclei, which are clear ﬁngerprints of static octupole
deformation [1], are frequently not observed even near
the center of the island of octupole deformation in the
lanthanides [18, 19, 26].

A. Xe isotopes.

Our RHB calculations (including those with the
CEDFs DD-ME2, PC-PK1 and DD-MEδ, not shown in
Table I) do not predict non-zero octupole deformation in
the N ∼ 88 nuclei (Table I). On the contrary, the mini-
mum in the PESs of the nuclei 142,144Xe with N = 86, 88
is characterized by β3 ∼ 0.06 in the MM calculations of
Ref. [51] with a folded Yukawa potential. A non-zero β3
deformation is also seen in the nucleus 144Xe N = 90
in the MM calculations with a Woods-Saxon potential
[84]. The HF+BCS calculations with the D1S Gogny
force predict non-zero octupole deformation in 142,144Xe
[85]. Experimental data on 142,144Xe [81] do not suggest
the stabilization of octupole deformation at the ground
state.

B. Ba isotopes.

A non-zero octupole deformation is predicted for the
N = 88 − 94 144−150Ba isotopes in calculations with DD-

in binding due to octupole deformation takes place at

culations with Gogny D1S force of Ref. [86] predict non-

nuclei with a maximum gain of binding due to octupole

N = 86 − 90 144−148Ce and N = 86 − 88 144,146Ce nuclei,
respectively. The HF+BCS calculations with the Gogny
D1S force of Ref. [86] predict octupole deformation in the
N = 84 − 90 142−148Ce nuclei.

D. Nd isotopes.

The N = 88 − 90 148−150Nd nuclei are predicted to
be octupole deformed with four CEDFs. The maximum
gain in binding due to octupole deformation is reached
at N = 88 for DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 and at N = 90 for
NL3* and PC-PK1. The N = 86 − 88 146,148Nd nuclei
are predicted to be octupole deformed in the MM calcula-
tions with a folded Yukawa potential (see Table I). On the
contrary, the MM calculations with a Woods-Saxon po-
tential do not predict octupole deformed Nd nuclei [84].
The N = 86 − 88 146−148Nd isotopes are predicted to be
octupole deformed in the HF+BCS calculations with the
Gogny force D1S [86].

However, the PESs are extremely soft in octupole di-
rection in the 148,156Sm nuclei, so that a slightly stronger
pairing (as compared with Ref. [13]) could easily drive
the system to reﬂection symmetry. A somewhat deeper
octupole minimum is seen in 150Sm in Ref. [13]. How-
ever, in this case the gain in binding due to octupole
deformation is comparable with the one presented in Ta-
ble I if the diﬀerence in pairing is taken into account.
The MM calculations with a Woods-Saxon potential of
Ref. [84] show that 150Sm is reﬂection symmetric in the
ground state, while the ones with a folded Yukawa poten-
tial (Ref. [51] and Table I) suggests that this nucleus is
only soft in octupole direction (|∆Eoct| = 20 keV). The
HF+BCS calculations with the Gogny force D1S of Ref.
[86] predict octupole deformation in the N = 86 − 88
148−150Sm nuclei. On the contrary, the HFB calculations
with D1S and D1M forces predict octupole deformation
only in 150Sm [71]. However, the gain in binding due to
octupole deformation is small (204 keV for D1S and 43
keV for D1M).

E. Sm isotopes.

Our calculations predict that only in the nucleus 150Sm
a very shallow octupole minimum (with |∆Eoct| = 0.25
MeV for DD-PC1 and |∆Eoct| = 0.09 MeV for NL3*)
is formed. On the contrary, the RMF+BCS calculations
with PK1 presented in Ref. [50] predict non-zero octupole
deformation in the nuclei 146−152Sm. The maximum gain
in binding due to octupole deformation (|∆Eoct| = 1.36
MeV) takes place in the N = 88 150Sm nucleus. This
large |∆Eoct| value would suggest a stabilization of oc-
tupole deformation in the ground state. However, the ex-
perimental data do not support such a possibility [1, 81].
Non-zero octupole deformation has also been seen in
RHB calculations with DD-PC1 in 148,150,156Sm [13].

V. THE IMPACT OF PAIRING ON THE

RELATIVE ENERGIES OF MINIMA WITH AND

WITHOUT OCTUPOLE DEFORMATION.

The extrapolation beyond the known region of nuclei
is always accompanied with a number of uncertainties re-
lated to the theoretical description of ﬁnite nuclei. For
example, some of them are connected with the uncer-
tainties in the theoretical description of single-particle
energies [54, 55, 87, 88]; they emerge from the particle-
hole channel of the density functional theories (DFTs).
To some degree, these uncertainties can be estimated by
using a set of diﬀerent functionals as it is done in the
present manuscript. In addition, there are the uncertain-
ties in the particle-particle (pairing) channel which be-
come especially large in the vicinity of two-neutron drip

FIG. 14. (Color online) The same as Fig. 1, but for the 148Ce obtained with the indicated CEDFs

line (see Refs. [55, 89]).
It is also expected that they
can aﬀect the relative energies of the minima with and
without octupole deformation and possibly the topology
of the potential energy surfaces in the cases of very soft
PESs. For example, it is well known that the selection of
the pairing force and the pairing strength aﬀects the po-
tential energy surfaces of ﬁssioning nuclei and their ﬁssion
barriers (see Ref. [65] and references therein). Moreover,
as shown in this reference, ﬁssion barrier heights decrease
with increasing pairing strength.

In order to understand how the variation of pairing
strength aﬀects the potential energy surfaces and rela-
tive energies of minima with and without octupole defor-
mation in octupole soft nuclei we have performed RHB
calculations with diﬀerent values of the scaling factor f

in Eq. (9) for the pairing force. The results of these cal-
culations are summarized in Figs. 15 and 16.

The impact of the pairing strength on the topology of
the PESs is shown in Fig. 15. Two local minima with
β2 ∼ 0.05, β3 = 0.0 (further on called quadrupole min-
imum) and β2 ∼ 0.15, β3 ∼ 0.12 (further on called oc-
tupole minimum) exist for all values of the scaling fac-
tor f . Although in this case the topology of the PES
is not strongly aﬀected by the change of f , two impor-
tant features are seen. First, similar to ﬁssioning nuclei
(Ref. [65]) the barrier between quadrupole and octupole
minima decreases with the increase of pairing strength.
Second, the increase of pairing strength changes the rel-
ative energies of octupole and quadrupole minima. The
octupole minimum is the lowest in energy for the val-

ues of f = 1.00, 1.03 and 1.06. However, the energy
diﬀerence |∆Eoct| between these two minima decreases
with increasing scaling factor f .
It is well known that
strong pairing favors spherical conﬁgurations. This leads
to the fact that at f = 1.075 pairing is so strong that the
quadrupole minimum becomes spherical; this minimum
is also the lowest in energy.

Similar eﬀects are seen in more systematic investiga-
tions presented in Fig. 16 for the chain of the Th iso-
topes. The largest values for |∆Eoct| are always observed
for the weakest pairing. This result does not depend on
the functional under consideration. Thus, one can con-
clude that in general pairing counteracts the shell eﬀects
and favors the shapes with no octupole deformation. Or
vise versa, the strongest impact of the octupole deforma-
tion (as quantiﬁed by ∆Eoct) is expected in the systems
with no pairing. Note also that the variation of pairing
strength typically does not aﬀect the neutron number at
which the maximum gain due to octupole deformation
takes place (at N = 136 for DD-PC1 and at N = 138 in
NL3*).

Note that the simple analysis within the random phase
approximation presented in Sec. IIIA of Ref. [1] also in-
dicates that pairing has a tendency to make the system
less octupole deformed.

VI. CONSEQUENCES FOR ROTATIONAL

NUCLEI

In Ref. [69] a systematic investigation of rotational
properties of the actinides within the cranked relativis-
tic Hartree-Bogoliubov approach with approximate par-
ticle number projection by means of the Lipkin-Nogami
method (further CRHB+LN) has revealed in light even-
even actinides with neutron number N ≤ 146 ranging
from 230Th up to 240Pu a paired band crossing leading
to an upbend in the kinematic moment of inertia J (1) at
a rotational frequency Ωx ∼ 0.2 MeV (see Figs. 9 and 10
in Ref. [69]). However, this upbend in J (1) is absent in
the experiment. Note that such problems with the de-
scription of rotational properties of light actinides exists
in all cranking calculations (see Sec. IV of Ref. [69] for
details). On the contrary, no such problems exist in the
description of the band crossings in even-even actinides
with neutron number N ≥ 148 within the CRHB+LN
approach (Ref. [69]); for these nuclei this approach has
also a good predictive power (Refs. [90, 91]).

The problem in the description of rotational proper-
ties of the N ≤ 146 actinides in Ref. [69] is most likely
related to the stabilization of octupole deformation at
high spin which is not taken into account in these model
calculations. The arguments in favor of such an inter-
pretation have been reviewed in Sec. IV of Ref. [69]. In
particular, stable octupole deformation has been shown
to delay alignment processes [92] and this may explain
the diﬀerences between theory and experiment in light
actinides.

15

The analysis of the PES of the nuclei with N ∼ 146
indicates that such a scenario is possible. This is illus-
trated by the examples of the U and Pu isotopes pre-
sented in Figs. 17 and 18. One can see that the PESs of
the N ≤ 146 U isotopes are very soft in β3 direction. The
octupole deformed solution with β3 6= 0.0 is even the low-
est in energy in 238U. However, the gain of binding due to
octupole deformation |∆Eoct| in this nuclei is very small
- only 94 keV (see Table I), and, thus, this nucleus re-
mains in the octupole vibrational regime. Dependent on
the underlying single-particle structure and its evolution
with spin, the rotation of these octupole soft nuclei may
lead to a stabilization of octupole deformation at high
spin [73, 84, 93] and the analysis of experimental data on
the N ≤ 146 actinides (see Sec. IV in Ref. [69]) strongly
points to such a possibility. The stiﬀness of the PES in
the direction of octupole deformation increases with the
increase of neutron number above N = 146 (see panels
for 240U and 242U in Fig. 17). As a result, the stabiliza-
tion of octupole deformation at high spin due to rotation
in these two nuclei is not likely. Indeed, the predictions
of the CRHB+LN calculations with no octupole defor-
mation [69] for rotational properties of the ground state
band in 240U almost coincide with recent experimental
data [91].

The same transition from octupole soft to octupole stiﬀ
potential energy surfaces is observed between N = 146
and N = 148 also in Pu (see Fig. 18), Th and Cm iso-
topes. Fig. 18 also illustrates that the results almost
do not depend on the functional since the PES obtained
with DD-PC1 and NL3* are very similar. The potential
energy surfaces of the N = 144 isotones (Figs. 17 and 18)
are soft in β3 direction but the minimum of the PES is
located at β3 = 0 (see also Table I). The same softness
is observed in the N = 146 isotopes (Figs. 17 and 18)
but the local minimum is located at β3 6= 0 (see Table
I). However, the binding energy gains due to octupole
deformation remain small (around 100 keV, see Table I)
so that the N = 146 Th, U, Pu and Cm isotopes remain
in the octupole vibrational regime. On the contrary, the
N = 148 Th, U, Pu and Cm isotones are characterized by
PES which are stiﬀ in β3-deformation (see, for example,
Figs. 17 and 18).

A detailed investigation of the impact of octupole
deformation on rotational properties requires the de-
velopment of a symmetry unrestricted cranked RHB
code which is deﬁnitely beyond the scope of the present
manuscript. However, the analysis of octupole softness
in the ground states establish a clear correlation with the
CRHB+LN results presented in Ref. [69]. The N ≥ 148
actinides are characterized by PESs which are stiﬀ in
the direction of octupole deformation. As a result, no
stabilization of octupole deformation due to rotation is
expected in these nuclei and the experimental data on
ground state rotational bands are well described in the
CRHB+LN calculations with no octupole deformation
[69, 90, 91]. On the contrary, the PESs of the N ≤ 146
actinides are soft in octupole deformation. Thus, at low

spin these nuclei are in the octupole vibrational regime in
which the CRHB+LN calculations with no octupole de-
formation describe well the moments of inertia (see Figs.
9 and 10 in Ref. [69]). However, with increasing spin
the transition to static octupole deformation (or to the
aligned vibrational limit) quite likely takes place and the
CRHB+LN calculations of Ref. [69] with no octupole de-
formation could not properly describe this process; they
predict upbends in the kinematic moments of inertia J (1)
which are not observed in experiment.

VII. GLOBAL ANALYSIS

We have carried out a global search for octupole de-
formation, which covers all even-even Z ≤ 106 nuclei be-
tween the two-proton and two-neutron lines, with CEDFs
DD-PC1 and NL3*. The selection of these two function-
als is guided by the following reasons. First, the DD-MEδ
functional is omitted from global studies since it does
not reproduce the experimental situation in octupole de-
formed actinides (Sec. III) and provides unrealistically
low ﬁssion barriers in superheavy nuclei (see Ref. [94]).
Second, the systematic studies with all four functionals
are numerically too time-consuming to be undertaken.
Thus, among the remaining functionals we selected the
two functionals DD-PC1 and NL3*, which show the
largest spread of the predictions not only for octupole-

deformed nuclei (Sec. III) but also for two-neutron drip
lines [54, 62], superheavy nuclei [56] and the evolution of
pairing with isospin in neutron-rich nuclei [54].

The results of this search are summarized in Table I
and in Fig. 19. The RHB results are also compared with
the MM results of Ref. [51]. Note that the MM results
cover only the part of the nuclear chart with neutron
numbers N ≤ 160. There are also the HFB calculations
with the Gogny forces D1S, D1M and D1N [6] which
cover a region of nuclei not extending far beyond the
known nuclei (see Fig. 9 in Ref. [6] for details). However,
these results are not added to Table I since the equilib-
rium octupole deformations β3 are not properly recorded
in the supplemental material to this publication; they are
always given as the multiplies of 0.02 (0.025) for the D1M
(D1N and D1S) functionals which indicates that they do
not correspond to the β3 values of the energy minimum.
One can see in Fig. 19 that in addition to the Ba,
Ce and Nd isotopes as well as the actinides discussed
above there are several regions of octupole deformed nu-
clei. These are nuclei around 80Zr, 110Zr and 200Dy which
are octupole soft. Since the gain of binding due to oc-
tupole deformation is quite small, no stabilization of oc-
tupole deformation is expected in these nuclei. Indeed,
the interpretation of experimental data on nuclei around
80Zr does not require the involvement of stable octupole
deformation [95]. Note that the HFB calculations with
the Gogny forces also indicate octupole softness of the

nuclei around 80Zr (see Fig. 9 in Ref. [6]). However, in
the MM calculations of Ref. [6], these nuclei do not have
octupole deformation (Table I).

In the RHB calculations with DD-PC1 there exists a
region of octupole soft Gd, Dy, and Er nuclei with N ∼
136 and A ∼ 200 (Fig. 19 and Table I). However, in the
RHB calculations with NL3* octupole softness is seen
only in 200Dy. This diﬀerence is quite likely due to the
fact that pairing correlations, which counteract octupole
deformation (see Sec. V), are substantially stronger in
neutron-rich nuclei for the NL3* functional as compared
with DD-PC1 (Ref. [55]). This region of nuclei will not
be accessible with future facilities like FRIB since it is
located beyond the expected reach of FRIB (Fig. 19).
As compared with our results, the MM calculations of
Ref. [51] predict a much broader Z ∼ 60, N ∼ 132 region
of nuclei with non-zero octupole deformation (see Fig. 3
in Ref. [51]). Note that the HFB calculations with Gogny
forces of Ref. [6] do not cover the Gd-Dy-Er region around
A ∼ 200.

In addition, octupole deformation is predicted in the
ground states of the actinides and light superheavy nuclei
with neutron number around N ∼ 196 (Table I and Fig.
19). To our knowledge, the existence of this region of oc-
tupole deformation, centered around Z ∼ 98, N ∼ 196,
has not been predicted before.
In many respects, it is
similar to the one located in the Z ∼ 90, N ∼ 136 ac-

17

tinides. For example, the gains in binding due to oc-
tupole deformation are similar in both regions and the
size of these regions in the (Z, N ) plane are comparable.
In the center of the Z ∼ 98, N = 196 region, |∆Eoct| is
around 1.5 MeV in the calculations with DD-PC1 and
around of 1.2 MeV in the calculations with NL3*. As
a result, some of the N ∼ 196 actinides could have a
stable octupole deformation in the ground state. This
diﬀerence in |∆Eoct| could be due to the fact that pair-
ing correlations, which counteract octupole deformation
(see Sec. V), are substantially stronger in neutron-rich
nuclei in the NL3* functional as compared with DD-PC1
one (Ref. [55]).

The maximum gain in binding due to octupole defor-
mation is changing from N = 198 (N = 200) to N = 192
(N = 196) on going from Th (Z = 90) to Fm (Z = 100)
nuclei in the calculations with DD-PC1 (NL3*) (see Ta-
ble I). While the predictions for the location of octupole
deformed nuclei in the Th-Fm region are more or less
similar in the calculations with DD-PC1 and NL3*, they
diverge for the No, Rf and Sg isotopes (Fig. 19). However,
this diﬀerence exists in octupole soft nuclei which have
only relatively small (less than 0.6 MeV) gain in bind-
ing due to octupole deformation |∆Eoct|. It is deﬁnitely
caused by the diﬀerences in underlying single-particle
structure (see Ref. [56]) which also leads to diﬀerent pre-
dictions for the ground state properties of superheavy
nuclei (see Ref. [56] for details).

Note that this region of nuclei will not be accessible
with future facilities like FRIB since it is located beyond
the expected reach of FRIB (Fig. 19). However, the ac-
counting of octupole deformation in the ground states
of these nuclei is important for the modeling of ﬁssion
recycling in neutron star mergers [96] since the gain in
binding of the ground states due to octupole deformation
will increase the ﬁssion barrier heights as compared with
the case when octupole deformation is neglected.

The presence of octupole deformation in these nuclei is
due to the interaction of the normal-parity 2h11/2 (from
the N = 7 shell) and the intruder 1k17/2 (from the N = 8
shell) neutron orbitals. These orbitals, located above the
N = 184 shell gap, are very close in energy at the Fermi
level in very heavy and superheavy nuclei in many nuclear
potentials (see, for example, Fig. 6.9 in Ref. [97] and Fig.
1 in Ref. [56]). The octupole coupling between proton
1i13/2 and 2f7/2 orbitals is still active in these nuclei but
its maximum is around Z = 98. On the contrary, it has
a maximum around Z = 92 in the A ∼ 230 octupole
deformed actinides. This change in the position of the
maximum of octupole interaction in the proton subsys-
tem is due to the increase of the neutron excess on going
from N ∼ 136 to N ∼ 196 and related modiﬁcations of
the properties of the proton potential.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

A global search for octupole deformation has been per-
formed within covariant density functional theory em-
ploying the DD-PC1 and NL3* functionals; this search
covers all even-even nuclei with Z ≤ 106 located between
the two-neutron and two-proton drip lines. In the regions
of octupole deformed light lanthanides and actinides, ad-
ditional studies have been performed with the CEDFs
DD-ME2, DD-MEδ, and PC-PK1 in order to establish
the sensitivity of the results to the choice of the functional
and to estimate theoretical uncertainties. The main re-
sults can be summarized as follows:

• The RHB calculations with the DD-PC1, PC-PK1
and DD-ME2 functionals correctly predict the is-
lands of octupole deformation in the light lan-

thanides and actinides which in general agrees with
available experimental data. The NL3* tends to
place the centers (in the (Z, N ) plane) of these two
islands by two neutrons higher than in above men-
tioned functionals. The DD-MEδ functional fails
to describe experimental data in the actinides.

• The gain in binding due to octupole deformation
|∆Eoct| is the quantity which deﬁnes the location
and the extend of the islands of octupole defor-
mation.
If one excludes the DD-MEδ functional,
theoretical uncertainties in its prediction are typi-
cally around 0.5 MeV; however, in some nuclei they
reach 1 MeV. This leads to the diﬀerences in the
predictions of the islands of octupole deformation.
The most important source of these uncertainties is
the diﬀerence in the prediction of underlying single-
particle structure (see Ref. [99] for comparison of

FIG. 19. (Color online) Octupole deformed nuclei in the nuclear chart. Only nuclei with non vanishing ∆E oct are shown by
squares; the colors of the squares represent the values of |∆E oct| (see colormap). Top and bottom panels display the results
obtained with the CEDFs DD-PC1 and NL3*, respectively. The blue dashed line shows the limits of the nuclear chart (deﬁned
as ﬁssion yield greater than 106) which may be achieved with dedicated existence measurements at FRIB [98]. The two-proton
and two-neutron drip lines are displayed by solid black lines.

diﬀerent DFTs). This is clearly seen for example in
light lanthanides where the maximum gain in bind-
ing due to octupole deformation is located mostly
at N = 88 and N = 90 in non-relativistic and rela-
tivistic models, respectively (see Sec. IV). Another
example is the diﬀerences in the predictions of the
borderlines of the island of octupole deformed nu-
clei in the U, Pu, Cm, Cf and Fm isotopes in rela-
tivistic and non-relativistic theories (see Sec. III).

• A new region of octupole deformation, centered
around Z ∼ 98, N ∼ 196, has been predicted for
the ﬁrst time.
In terms of the size in the (Z, N )
plane and the impact of octupole deformation on
binding energies this region is similar to the known
Z ∼ 90, N ∼ 136 region of octupole deformation
in actinides. The presence of octupole deforma-
tion in these nuclei is due to the interaction of the
2h11/2 and 1k17/2 neutron orbitals and of the 1i13/2
and 2f7/2 proton orbitals. Note that the maxi-
mum of the interaction of proton orbitals occurs
at a higher proton number Z as compared with the
well known A ∼ 230 region of octupole deformation
in actinides.

• Important correlations between the softness of the

potential energy surfaces in octupole deformation
and the behavior of ground state rotational bands
of the N ≥ 140 even-even nuclei have been revealed.
These nuclei do not possess stable octupole defor-
mation in the ground states. The rotational prop-
erties of the N ≥ 148 nuclei with stiﬀ potential en-
ergy surfaces with respect to octupole deformation
are well described in the CRHB+LN approach ne-
glecting octupole deformation [69]. In addition, for
these nuclei this approach has a predictive power
as illustrated in Refs. [90, 91]. The moments of in-
ertia of lighter nuclei are also well described at low
and medium spins but the CRHB+LN approach
predicts paired band crossings at rotational fre-
quency Ωx ∼ 0.2 MeV which are not observed in
experiment. This discrepancy between theory and
experiment is most likely due to stabilization of
octupole deformation at high spin which becomes
possible because the potential energy surfaces of
the N ≤ 146 actinides are soft in octupole defor-
mation at the ground states.

• The impact of pairing correlations on the proper-
ties of octupole deformed nuclei has been studied.
In general, pairing counteracts shell eﬀects and fa-

vors shapes with no octupole deformation. Thus,
the strongest impact of octupole deformation is ex-
pected in systems with no or weak pairing. The
barrier between quadrupole and octupole local min-
ima is at maximum for no pairing and decreases
with increasing pairing strength.

• Comparing diﬀerent functionals, one can see that
the results obtained with the covariant energy den-
sity functional DD-MEδ diﬀer substantially from
the results of other functionals. This eﬀect is es-
pecially pronounced in actinides where DD-MEδ
does not lead to octupole deformation of the nu-
clei which are known to be octupole deformed. In
addition, the heights of the inner ﬁssion barriers in
superheavy nuclei with Z = 112 − 116 obtained in
this functional are signiﬁcantly lower than the ex-
perimental estimates and the values calculated in
all other models [94]. This functional is diﬀerent
from all the other functionals used here, because it
has been adjusted in Ref. [61] using only four phe-

20

nomenological parameters in addition to some in-
put from ab initio calculations [100, 101]. All these
facts suggest that either the ab initio input for this
functional is not precise enough or the number of
only four phenomenological parameters (ﬁtted to
masses of spherical nuclei) is too small to provide
a proper description of the details of the single-
particle structure. Thus, this functional is not rec-
ommended for future investigations, in spite of the
fact that it provides a good description of masses
and some other ground-state observables [54].
