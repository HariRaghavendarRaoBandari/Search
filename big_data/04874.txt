As part of a recent analysis of exclusive two-photon production of W +W − pairs at the LHC,
the CMS experiment used di-lepton data to obtain an “eﬀective” photon-photon luminosity. We
show how this analysis, with some assumptions, can be used to signiﬁcantly constrain the photon
parton distribution functions, such as those from the CTEQ, MRST, and NNPDF collaborations.
In particular, it strongly disfavors the central NNPDF2.3 photon, as well as the MRST2004QED
current quark distribution and large values of the photon momentum fraction for CT14QED. We
also reconsider a recent proposal that the diphoton excess seen by both the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations could be explained by a scalar produced via photon fusion. Taking into account the
constraints from the CMS data, the relationship between the total width and the branching ratio
for such an object is updated to reﬂect the newly allowed region.

INTRODUCTION

With the start of the 13 TeV run of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), more precise theory calculations are
needed to correctly interpret the present and upcom-
ing experimental data. Calculations at the next-to-next-
to-leading order (NNLO) in Quantum ChromoDynamics
(QCD) are becoming the standard, so that the theoreti-
cal uncertainty can be reduced to the same order as the
experimental uncertainty. At this level of precision, the
leading-order electroweak correction is also important,
because the square of the coupling of the strong interac-
tion (αs) is of the same order of magnitude as the electro-
magnetic coupling (α). Therefore, it becomes necessary
to include electroweak corrections in the calculations.

One particular electroweak correction of interest is that
due to photons coming from the proton in the initial
state. This requires the inclusion of the photon as a par-
ton inside the proton, with an associated parton distri-
bution function (PDF). This is necessary both for consis-
tency when electroweak corrections are included and be-
cause the photon-initiated processes can become signiﬁ-
cant at high energies. The treatment of the photon PDF
in a global analysis was ﬁrst performed by the MRST
collaboration [1]. Since then, both NNPDF and CTEQ
collaborations have introduced photon PDFs [2, 3], along
with PDF evolution at leading order (LO) in QED
and next-to-leading order (NLO) or NNLO in QCD.
The MRST2004QED set contains photon PDFs with a
parametrization based on radiation oﬀ of “primordial” up
and down quarks, with the photon radiation cut oﬀ at low
scales. Two choices of the cutoﬀ are given: a set with the
cutoﬀ at the current quark masses is labeled as MRST0
and a set with the cutoﬀ at the constituent quark masses
is labeled as MRST1[1]. The NNPDF2.3QED set uses
a more general photon parametrization, which was then
constrained by high-energy W , Z and Drell-Yan data at
the LHC [2]. The CT14QED sets also use the radiative

ansatz, but with the photon momentum fraction at the
initial scale left as a free parameter. Data on Deep In-
elastic Scattering (DIS) with isolated photon from the
ZEUS collaboration [4] were used to constrain the initial
momentum fraction to be less than 0.14% at the 90%
conﬁdence level [3].

With the large amounts of data to be collected at the
LHC, photon-initiated processes will become increasingly
important. For instance, a precise determination of the
quartic couplings of photons and W -bosons can be ob-
tained through the analysis of W pair production through
photon-fusion. This has been shown to be the most
precise channel to measure these couplings [5, 6], with
the possibility of measurements that are several orders
of magnitude more precise than the limits found at the
Tevatron [7] and LEP [8–14]. Furthermore, new physics
processes may occur through photon-initiated produc-
tion, as has been suggested recently as an explanation for
the 750 GeV excess in di-photon events at the LHC [15–
17]. For all of these uses, a good understanding of the
initial photon PDF is vital.

This paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we con-
sider the CMS study of exclusive two-photon produc-
tion of W boson pairs [18], and show how the di-lepton
cross-check analysis can be used to constrain the pho-
ton PDF. Secondly, we compare the MRST2004QED,
NNPDF2.3QED, and CT14QED photon PDFs in terms
of the ﬁrst moment of the PDFs and through the photon-
photon luminosity at the LHC with a 13 TeV center-of-
mass collider energy. Finally, we discuss the recently seen
excess in di-photon production at Mγγ at the LHC and
how the interpretation of this in terms of a resonance in
the photon-fusion channel is impacted by constraints on
the photon PDFs. This in followed by our summary.

CONSTRAINTS FROM THE CMS ANALYSIS

2

Recently,

the process

the CMS experiment at the LHC has
performed a measurement of
(pp →
p(∗)W +W −p(∗)) at √s = 7 TeV, and used this to put
constraints on anomalous quartic gauge couplings [18]. In
this measurement they selected for photon-photon fusion
events, including events where both protons remained in-
tact and also inelastic (quasi-exclusive or ”proton disso-
ciative”) in which one or both protons dissociate. This
selection was attained by requiring no additional associ-
ated charged tracks beyond the µ±e∓, which identiﬁed
the W boson pairs.
In order to predict the expected
rate of pp → p(∗)W +W −p(∗), they used the much-higher-
statistics sample of µ+µ− events (oﬀ the Z-peak and
in the same mass-squared range) to extract an eﬀective
photon-photon luminosity. This was obtained by taking
the ratio of the µ+µ− events with no additional associ-
ated charge tracks to that predicted from purely elastic
scattering (after subtracting possible quark-initiated con-
tamination, estimated from Z-peak events). This data-
driven approach was then used to predict the total cross
section to be σ(pp → p(∗)W +W −p(∗) → p(∗)µ±e∓p(∗)) =
4.0 ± 0.7 fb, after including W boson decay branching
fraction. Since this predicted cross section uses their ex-
tracted photon-photon luminosity, it includes both elastic
and proton dissociative contributions.

We now compare this prediction to our prediction us-
ing the CT14QED PDFs, which consist of a range of sets
in which the photon momentum fraction of the proton,
deﬁned at the scale Q0 = 1.3 GeV, can be varied from
0% up to 0.3%. For this comparison, we calculate the to-
tal cross section for W -pair production1 via the photon-
photon fusion process γγ → W +W −, with the proper W
boson decay branching ratios included, at the leading-
order in electroweak interaction. The factorization scale
is chosen to be the invariant mass (√ˆs) of the W -boson
pair, unless speciﬁed. As shown in Fig. 1, the CMS data
can constrain the allowed initial photon momentum frac-
tion (pγ
0 ) to be less than 0.09% at the 68% conﬁdence
level (CL), where we have varied the factorization scale
by a factor of 2 around √ˆs. It is interesting to note that
the constraint at the 90% CL is pγ
0 ≤ 0.13%, which agrees
well with the constraint (less than about 0.14%) derived
from comparing to the isolated photon production rate
in DIS process, measured by ZEUS Collaboration [3].

Furthermore, the data can be used to discriminate
CT14QED, NNPDF2.3QED and MRST2004QED pho-
ton PDF sets. As seen in Fig. 2, both MRST0 (using

the current quark masses) and the NNPDF2.3QED aver-
age photon PDF predict a much larger cross-section than
the CMS data. In addition, the uncertainty on the cross
section predicted from the CMS analysis is much smaller
than the PDF uncertainty given by the NNPDF2.3QED
PDFs. Recall that NNPDF2.3QED PDFs were deter-
mined by including LHC data on high-energy W , Z, and
Drell-Yan production, in which the photon-photon con-
tribution to these processes is generally small compared
to the dominant quark-antiquark annihilation subpro-
cess. The present constraints, based on the CMS analy-
sis of µ+µ− production, use similar data, but are more
powerful because the CMS analysis isolates the photon-
photon contribution.

One caveat about the use of the CMS eﬀective photon-
photon luminosity to constrain the photon PDFs is the
fact that the no-associated-charged-tracks cut will re-
move some of the photon-photon induced events, par-
ticularly in the case where the photon dissociates.
If
this is taken into account, one would expect that some-
what larger initial photon PDFs could be allowed. In the
CMS analysis, a comparison with a model calculation es-
timated that roughly 20% of the photon-photon induced
events did not pass the cut. However, this survival prob-
ability for the photon-photon fusion events is diﬃcult to
calculate reliably from ﬁrst principles.
In our present
analysis, we have neglected this point, assuming that it
does not have an extreme eﬀect on our conclusions.

PHOTON PDF COMPARISONS

1 We emphasize that, although we are using the W +W − cross
section for the comparison, it is in fact the eﬀective photon-
photon luminosity extracted from the CMS di-muon data that
constrains the photon PDFs.

A comparison of the size of the photon PDFs can be
made by examining the ﬁrst moment of the PDF as a
function of the factorization scale. The ﬁrst moment of

where x is the momentum fraction the photon takes from

carry a signiﬁcantly larger momentum fraction than do
the MRST1 and the preferred CT14QED photon PDFs.
To facilitate the comparison of theory predictions of

tum fractions of the photons from each proton. These
are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for the LHC at 13 TeV col-
lider energy for low- and high-invariant mass regions, re-
spectively. In the low-invariant mass region around ap-
proximately 250 GeV, all of the PDFs are comparable
except MRST0, which is signiﬁcantly larger. Moreover,
in this region the central value for NNPDF is compa-
rable with both MRST1 and CT14 with 0.09% momen-
tum fraction. However, in the high-invariant mass re-
gion above approximately 1 TeV, the NNPDF2.3QED
greatly exceeds the other PDFs, even MRST0. This can
be traced to the large uncertainty in the photon PDF de-
termination at large x, as well as the extra freedom in the
NNPDF2.3QED photon PDF parametrization, resulting
in a larger NNPDF2.3QED photon PDF at large x.

PHOTON FUSION PRODUCTION OF A 750 GEV

DIPHOTON RESONANCE

After the ﬁrst announcement of the 13 TeV results
from the LHC, there was a lot of excitement about an
excess seen by both the ATLAS and CMS experiments
in the diphoton channel at an invariant mass of around
750 GeV [15, 16]. C. Csaki, et al. proposed that this
excess could be explained by production of a resonance
via photon-photon fusion, with subsequent decay to the
diphoton channel [17]. They applied the following for-
mula to determine a relationship between the width and
branching ratio of the new resonance:

σ = Lγγ(8π2)(cid:18) ΓS

MS(cid:19) Br2(S → γγ)

(3)

where Lγγ is the photon-photon luminosity at a given
scale and a given collider energy, ΓS is the width of the
new resonance, MS is the mass of the new resonance,
and Br(S → γγ) is the branching ratio of the new res-
onance to diphoton. They further simplﬁed the above
equation, by assuming the mass was 750GeV, and by
scaling the width by 45GeV. After including the con-
tributions from inelastic-inelastic, elastic-inelastic, and
elastic- elastic processes, they found that in the narrow
width approximation, the total photoproduction cross
section at the LHC with 13 TeV center-of-mass energy
is

σ = 10.8pb(cid:18) ΓS

45GeV(cid:19) Br2(S → γγ)

of 20 GeV to 500 GeV for 13 TeV collider energy

FIG. 5: Photon-photon luminosity for and invariant
mass of 500 GeV to 6000 GeV for 13 TeV collider energy

This value was obtained by using a combination of the
Equivalent Photon Approximation (EPA) [19] to obtain
the photon-photon luminosity for the elastic collisions,
and NNPDF2.3 PDFs were used for calculating the in-
elastic collisions. These values were then weighted by the
ratios of inelastic-inelastic, partially elastic, and purely
elastic collisions [17].

However, as shown in our discussion of the CMS anal-
ysis, the partonic photon PDFs are used for inclusive
calculations and therefore contain both the elastic and
inelastic contributions. In other words, the elastic pho-
ton contribution should not be added separately. Using
only the CT14QED photon PDFs with momentum frac-
tion varying from 0% to 0.09%, as preferred by the CMS
analysis at the 68% conﬁdence level, we ﬁnd the range
for the prefactor in the above equation to be between 1.7
pb and 3.6 pb. These updated values further support
the explanation for why this resonance was not observed
during the 8 TeV run of the LHC. At 8 TeV, this prefac-
tor is in the range of 0.5-1.3 pb. This reduction from the
13 TeV run can also be obtained from Figs. 4 and 5. We
note that the typical x value for a 750 GeV resonance
produced at 8 TeV LHC is 0.094, which corresponds to
M = 1.2 TeV at 13 TeV LHC. One can easily read out
from Figs. 4 and 5 that the photon-photon luminosity at
M = 1.2 TeV is smaller by one order of magnitude as
compared to that at M = 750 GeV.

CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that it is already possible to use data
from the 7 TeV run of the LHC to constrain the photon
PDFs at the same level as the HERA data, and these
constraints will become much stronger with the 13 TeV
data, and higher luminosities. The CMS data that is used
to constrain the photon PDF includes both the elastic

and inelastic contributions, and therefore, solely using
the photon PDFs is suﬃcient to obtain the desired re-
sults for a prediction of the total cross-section induced
by photon-photon fusion. Furthermore, the CMS data
strongly disfavors both the MRST0 and NNPDF2.3QED
photon PDFs, under the assumption that the survival
probability of the photon events in the analysis is not
unreasonably small. Finally, the proper implementation
of the photon PDF is used to update the needed width
and branching ratios of a new scalar particle to explain
the excess seen by both the ATLAS and CMS Collabo-
rations.
