Dopants of transition metal ions in II-VI semiconductors exhibit a native 2+ valency. Despite
this, 3+ or mixed 3+/2+ valency of iron ions in ZnO was reported previously. Several contradictory
mechanisms have been proposed for explanation of this fact so far. Our ab initio calculations indicate
that the Fe ion is a non-typical donor with a half-resonance character: Fe2+ charge state is unstable
because the donor level of the Fe2+ is within the conduction band continuum, but the autoionization
from 2+ to 3+ charge state is only partial because the donor level of the ionized Fe3+ is below the
bottom of the conduction band. A complete ionization of the Fe requires a non-zero ionization
energy. Using several experimental methods like electron paramagnetic resonance, magnetometry,
conductivity, excitonic magnetic circular dichroism and magneto-photoluminescence we conﬁrm the
3+ valency of the iron ions in polycrystalline (Zn,Fe)O ﬁlms with the Fe content attaining 0.2%. The
n-type conductivity and the Fe donor ionization energy, 0.14 eV, are consistent with the theoretical
estimations. Our magnetooptical measurements conﬁrm the calculated non-vanishig s,p-d exchange
interaction between band carriers and localized magnetic moments of the Fe3+ ions in the ZnO,
being so far an unsettled issue.

INTRODUCTION

lence states (2+ and 3+)20–24 or exclusively in 3+ state.25

The magnetically doped zinc oxide holds a great
promise for implementations in optoelectronic devices.1–4
As a member of a wide bandgap semiconductor family
it is characterized by a small lattice constant, a pos-
sible large p-d hybridization, a small spin-orbit inter-
action, and a large exciton oscillator strength. These
properties make ZnO based dilute magnetic semicon-
ductors DMSs highly attractive for room temperature
applications.2,5,6 Unique magnetic and magnetooptical
properties have been already demonstrated, e.g.,
for
(Zn,Co)O and (Zn,Mn)O.1,7–10 Ultra long spin coherence
time (> 150 µs) found recently11 for Fe3+ ions in the ZnO
indicates (Zn,Fe)O as a highly promising spintronic sys-
tem. Systematic studies of magnetooptical properties of
the ZnO doped with iron ions are, however, still miss-
ing. In particular, in the work of Ando et al. (Ref. 7)
Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectrum has been
shown for the (Zn,Fe)O, but no dependence on the mag-
netic ﬁeld nor the iron charge state was determined. Also,
there is no literature record related to properties of near-
the-band-gap photoluminescence (PL) of the (Zn,Fe)O in
magnetic ﬁeld.

Dopants of transition metal ions in II-VI semiconduc-
tors natively exhibit the 2+ valency. In particular, 2+
valency was reported for the iron ions in CdS, ZnS, CdSe,
ZnSe, CdTe and ZnTe.12–19 In the case of ZnO the Fe ions
have been, however, observed either parallel in both va-

Several contradictory mechanisms have been put for-
ward for explanation of 3+ valency of iron in ZnO,
like promotion of Fe2+ into Fe3+ due to a compensa-
tion induced by Zn vacancies,22 photoionization of Fe2+
centers25 or a direct charge transfer from the ion to the
conduction band24. In parallel, the long spin coherence
time11 suggests that the Fe3+ ions in ZnO are decoupled
from their environment. Thus, there are at least two
questions that still need to be answered: (i) What is the
valency of Fe ions in ZnO? (ii) Do the Fe3+ ions couple
to band carriers through s,p-d exchange interaction?

In this work, we ﬁrst present the results of the Density
Functional Theory study of the electronic and magnetic
properties of Fe in ZnO. The results indicate that the Fe
ion in ZnO is intermediate between a typical donor, with
the donor (0/+) level in the band gap, and a resonant
donor, with the donor level degenerate with the contin-
uum of the conduction band. This case, which was not
discussed previously according to our best knowledge, is
dubbed here a half-resonant donor. More speciﬁcally, the
occupied d level of Fe2+ is situated above the bottom of
the conduction band, what makes the 2+ charge state
of Fe unstable. As a result, a partial autoionization of
the Fe2+ with the transfer of the electron to the con-
duction band occurs. The autoionization would be com-
plete in the case of a genuine resonant donor, when the
donor level of the ionized donor is degenerate with the
conduction band continuum. In the case of Fe in ZnO,

the autoionization is partial only, because the empty d
level of the Fe3+ is below the bottom of the conduction
band. The ﬁnal electron conﬁguration is established by a
charge self-regulation mechanism, and the charge state of
Fe, denoted as ”Fe2+”, is intermediate between 2+ and
3+, and characterized by a non-zero ionization energy.
Moreover, the present calculations point toward non-zero
values of s,p-d exchange constants in the (Zn,Fe)O. In
the second part of the paper we provide a set of experi-
mental results of magnetometry, conductivity and mag-
netooptical measurements on the (Zn,Fe)O samples with
Fe content attaining 0.2%. They conﬁrm the theoretical
ﬁndings. Brillouin-like dependencies found in measure-
ments of MCD and of PL in magnetic ﬁeld along with
a clear Curie-paramagnetic dependence on temperature
of magnetization determined from magnetospectroscopy
conﬁrm presence of Fe ions in 3+ valency and the ion-
carrier s,p-d exchange interaction in the (Zn,Fe)O.

The paper is organised as follows. Section II presents
the method and the results of the calculations, which
explain the valency of iron ions in ZnO and predict non-
zero s,p-d exchange integrals for the (Zn,Fe)O. Section III
describes the samples studied along with the results of
their structural characterization. Section IV gathers ex-
perimental results obtained with non-optical methods,
which testify the presence of iron ions in 3+ valency in
the studied samples. Sec. V reports on the results of
magnetospectroscopy investigations, which conﬁrm the
ﬁndings from the Sec. II and Sec. IV, in particular by
providing evidence for the s,p-d exchange interaction in
the (Zn,Fe)O.

II. THEORY

A. Theoretical background and method of

calculations

Theoretical description of transition metal (TM) im-
purities in semiconductors represents a demanding test
for electronic structure calculations for two reasons. The
ﬁrst one is that the Local Density Approximation (LDA)
and the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) to
the Density Functional Theory severely underestimate
the band gap, due to which the TM levels can be incor-
rectly predicted to form resonances degenerate with the
conduction band continuum, rather than the experimen-
tally observed states in the band gap. This error can lead
to a erroneous charge state of a TM impurity, metallic
rather than insulating crystal, spurious magnetic interac-
tions between the dopants, etc.26,27 The second problem
is related with the localized nature of the 3d wave func-
tions, for which many body eﬀects can play an important
role, requiring usage of approaches beyond LDA/GGA.
This holds for both orbitals of host semiconductors and
d(TM) impurity orbitals.

In the case of ZnO, both the LDA and GGA give a
too small band gap Egap of about 1.0 eV,28–30 and a too

2

high energy of the d(Zn)-derived bands relative to the
valence band maximum (VBM).31 The GW approxima-
tion, albeit correcting considerably the band structure
of pure ZnO, still underestimates the room temperature
experimental gap of ZnO, 3.4 eV, by about 1 eV,32 and
still places the d(Zn) band too high.30 An alternative
pseudoempirical approach consists in using GGA supple-
mented by the +U corrections,33–35 which are treated
as free parameters ﬁtted to experimental data. The +U
term initially applied to d(Zn) orbitals30,36–38 opens the
gap by almost 1 eV, which is not suﬃcient. To obtain the
correct Egap one should observe that the upper valence
band is mainly derived from the p(O) orbitals. Conse-
quently, the inclusion of the U term for the p(O) orbitals,
in addition to U (Zn), gives a correct band structure.39,40
The calculations are performed within Density Func-
tional Theory with the GGA for the exchange-correlation
potential.41,42 The +U corrections are included according
to Refs. 33–35. We use the pseudopotential method im-
plemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO code,43 with
the valence atomic conﬁguration 3d104s2 for Zn, 2s2p4
for O and 3s2p64s2p03d6 for Fe, respectively. The plane-
waves kinetic energy cutoﬀs of 30 Ry for wave functions
and 180 Ry for charge density are employed. The elec-
tronic structure of ZnO in the wurtzite phase is examined
with the 8 × 8 × 8 k-point grid. Analysis of a single Fe
impurity in ZnO is performed using the 3 × 3 × 2 super-
cell with 72 atoms (2.8 at % of Fe) and the 3 × 3 × 4
supercell with 144 atoms (1.4 at % of Fe).
In spite of
the relatively high concentration of Fe assumed in the
calculations, the obtained energies of Fe gap levels hold
also in the limit of an isolated Fe impurity to a good ap-
proximation. Indeed, with the decreasing concentration
(i.e., the increasing supercell size) the Fe-induced peaks
in the DOS become more narrow, but the shifts of max-
ima change by more no than 0.15 eV. For the density of
states (DOS) calculations, the k-space summations are
performed with a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point grid. Ionic positions
are optimized until the forces acting on ions are smaller
than 0.02 eV/˚A. Methfessel-Paxton44 smearing method
with the smearing width of 0.136 eV or lower is used
for partial occupancies. Calculations with ﬁxed occupa-
tion matrices are performed at the Γ point only using the
smaller 3 × 3 × 2 supercell.

The values of the U terms for 3d(Zn) and 2p(O) or-
bitals are ﬁtted to the band structure of ZnO. We ﬁnd
that U (Zn)=12.5 eV and U (O)=6.25 eV reproduce both
the experimental Egap of 3.3 eV,37 and the energy of the
d(Zn) band, centered about 8 eV below the VBM. These
values are in excellent agreement with Ref. 40. The re-
laxed crystal structure agrees well with experiment: the
lattice parameters a = 3.23 ˚A and c = 5.19 ˚A as well
as internal parameter u = 0.38 are underestimated by
less than 1 % in comparison with experimental values
a = 3.25 ˚A, c = 5.20 ˚A, and u = 0.38.45 The value of
U (Fe) is considered as a free parameter varying from 0
to 6 eV. Finally, the increase of the temperature from 0
to 300 K causes a change of the measured band gap by

about 0.1 eV. This change is neglected in the calculations,
since it does not aﬀect the conclusions.

B. Fe impurity in ZnO

In ideal II-VI semiconductors, i.e., those without ad-
ditional dopants and defects, a single Fe impurity is ex-
pected to occur in the Fe2+ (q = 0) charge state, with
6 electrons on the d(Fe)-induced levels and spin S = 2.
However, as it follows from the present results, in ZnO
the electronic conﬁguration of Fe is intermediate between
the Fe2+ and Fe3+, i.e., is more complex due to the fact
that the (0/+) transition level of Fe is almost degenerate
with the CBM. Clearly, the Fe3+ (q = +1) charge state
with 5 electrons on the d(Fe) levels and S = 5/2 may be
assumed in the presence of acceptors in the host, i.e., in
compensated samples.

The band structure and DOS of ZnO doped with the
Fe2+ and Fe3+ is shown in Fig. 1 for U (Fe)= 0. The im-
purity d(Fe) states constitute nearly dispersionless bands

and their positions strongly depend on the Fe charge
state. To make the discussion transparent we begin the
analysis by the Fe3+, and then move to the Fe2+.

The Fe ion in the q = +1 charge state, the Fe3+, as-
sumes the electronic conﬁguration d5 with total spin 5/2.
In this case, Fe introduces two spin-up states close to the
VBM: the e2↑ doublet, which is a broad resonance within
the valence band, and centered at ∼ −1.5 eV, and the
t2↑ triplet which practically is degenerate with the va-
lence band maximum. (Actually, t2↑ is split into a singlet
and a doublet by the wurtzite crystal ﬁeld with a small
splitting of about 0.1 eV. To simplify the discussion, this
eﬀect is neglected.) The exchange spin-up−spin-down
splitting is strong, ∼ 3 eV, since the e2↓ doublet is at
2.4 eV, while the t2↓ triplet is very close to the CBM.
Both spin down levels are empty.

Addition of one electron to the ZnO:Fe3+ system
should result in the q = 0 charge state of Fe, that is
the Fe2+, with 6 electrons on the d(Fe)-induced levels.
However, this electronic conﬁguration cannot be reached.
According to the present results, the strong Coulomb in-
tracenter repulsion causes an increase of all Fe levels by
about 1 eV induced by the increasing occupancy of the
Fe states, as it is shown in Fig. 1. Consequently, both
spin-up states are in the band gap, with the e2↑ doublet
at 0.5 eV and the t2↑ triplet at 1.1 eV above VBM. More
importantly, the spin-down states are degenerate with
the conduction band.
In particular, the e2↓ doublet is
about 0.5 eV above CBM, and the t2↓ triplet is higher by

∼ 1 eV. Therefore, the sixth electron that should occupy
e2↓ autoionizes to the bottom of the conduction band. A
more detailed analysis shows that autoionization is par-
tial only. The transition from the Fe3+ to Fe2+ is shown
in Fig. 2. The ﬁgure shows both the changes of the Fe
energy levels, and the changes of occupancies when the
charge state q progressively varies from the Fe3+ (q = 1)
to Fe2+ (q = 0), i.e., when one electron is progressively
added to the ZnO:Fe3+ system. Initially, for 1 > q > 0.5,
the occupancy of the e2↓ doublet, λ(e2↓), increases lin-
early, and so does its energy. In this regime e2↓ is a gap
state. For q ≈ 0.5, e2↓ crosses the CBM and becomes a
resonance. For 0.5 > q > 0, the electron partially occu-
pies both the conduction states and the e2↓ resonance.
The energy of the Fermi level EF , the energy of e2↓, and
the occupancies of the Fe and the conduction states are
determined self-consistently by the charge self-regulation
mechanism. As it follows from Fig. 2b, for q = 0, i.e.,
when one electron is added to the Fe3+, the occupancy of
e2↓ is 0.7, and the integrated occupancy of the conduc-
tion states up to EF is 0.3, (which formally corresponds
to Fe2.3+). The transition (q = 1) → (q = 0) is schemat-
ically shown in Fig. 2c. Importantly, one should observe
that since there are no empty states below the Fermi en-
ergy, EF must be located within the partially occupied
e2↓ resonance. Thus, the density of states at the Fermi
level is ﬁnite, and the system is metallic.

The electronic conﬁguration for q = 0 in Fig. 2 with
partial occupancy of e2↓, denoted as ”Fe2+”,
is fun-
damentally diﬀerent from the genuine Fe3+ (q = +1)
state, which can be assumed in the presence of acceptors
in ZnO. The calculated (0/+) transition level is about
3.2 eV, i.e., 0.2 eV below the CBM. However, we stress
that the accurate evaluation of this level is ambiguous
because the ﬁnal conﬁguration denoted as q = 0 does
not correspond to Fe2+.

The localized character of d(Fe) is also responsible for
the relatively large changes of bond lengths with the
charge state. Because of the wurtzite symmetry, the
Fe-O bond d1 along the c-axis is not equivalent to the
three remaining basal bonds d2. The calculated values
are d1 = 1.89 (1.96) ˚A and d2 = 1.89 (1.95) ˚A for Fe3+
(”Fe2+”), respectively. The increase of bond lengths by
about 3.5 % induces an upward shift of e2↓ and t2↓ thanks
to the antibonding character of their wave functions.

Inclusion of the U (Fe) correction modiﬁes energies of
the Fe levels, but does not change the picture obtained for
U (Fe)= 0. The dependence of Fe states on U (Fe) is pre-
sented in Fig. 3. As it is discussed in detail in Ref. 46 for
transition metal impurities in GaN, the U -induced shift
of an impurity level depends on its occupation, and is
negative (positive) for the occupied (empty) state. This
feature is clearly seen in Fig. 3 for both the occupied e2↑
and t2↑, and empty e2↓ and t2↓ levels. The calculated de-
pendencies of e2↑ and t2↑ on U (Fe) are non-linear because
of their increasing hybridization with valence states. The
instability of Fe2+ remains even for large U (Fe)= 6 eV,
since e2↓ is degenerate with the conduction band for all

U (Fe).

Previous theoretical investigations of Fe in ZnO pro-
vided conﬂicting results regarding the stability of the
Fe2+ charge state.26,47–51 The uncertainty is largely due
to the band gap problem, mentioned in the Subsec-
tion II A. The LDA/GGA calculations typically situated
the e2↓ of Fe2+ above the CBM, but this level ordering
can result from the too low band gap. On the other hand,
the gap-corrected approaches predicted the e2↓ state just
below the CBM. In the former case, the instability of
Fe2+ is expected, but this possibility was not addressed.
More speciﬁcally, in Ref. 47 the LDA was used. The
e2↓ state of Fe was found to pin the Fermi level, and
its energy was degenerate with the CBM; this is close to
the present results. Such a situation was also predicted
by the LDA calculations of Ref. 48. The LDA was also
used in Ref. 49 with the +U term applied to d(Fe) or-
bitals, which gave a strongly underestimated band gap,
and the energy of e2↓ above the CBM. Previous theoret-
ical approaches to Fe in ZnO with the improved gap in-
cluded the LDA with the self-interaction corrections and
U (Fe)= 5.5 eV;50 this provieded a wide Fe-induced spin-
down band in the band gap. Similarly, the band structure
of pure ZnO was ﬁtted to experiment in Ref. 26, and the
corrections for d(Fe), U = 3.5 eV and J = 1 eV (thus
eﬀectively U (Fe)=2.5 eV) were applied. The (+/0) tran-
sition level was found at 1.98 eV, i.e., about 1.4 eV below
the CBM. In Ref. 51, GGA+U with U (Fe)= 2.2 eV and
U (Zn)= 5.5 eV was employed, and the (+/0) transition
level was predicted at about 2 eV above the VBM. How-
ever, the method of correcting Egap was not speciﬁed. In
these works, the t2↑ level of Fe2+ typically was situated
at about 0.7−1.0 eV above the VBM, and e2↑ was a res-
onance below the top of the valence band; this is close to
our results obtained with U (Fe)≈ 2 eV.

C.

Ionization energy

We now turn to the electronic structure and ionization
energy of an isolated Fe impurity in ZnO. This question
should be addressed because the results from Sec. II B
were obtained for ﬁnite, and high, Fe concentrations of
1.4 % and 2.8 %, i.e., about 5 × 1020 cm−3, when the cal-
culated Fermi level and the e2↓ energy are 0.5 eV above
the CBM due to the Burstein-Moss shift. First, one
should note that for the isolated Fe the increase of the e2↓
energy induced by the increasing occupancy takes place
as well, because it follows from the intra-center Coulomb
interaction, which is not sensitive to the presence of other
Fe donors to a good approximation. Therefore, in agree-
ment with Fig. 2, spilling of electron to the CBM begins
for q = 0.5. In the limit of a single Fe impurity in an
inﬁnite crystal, the Fermi level coincides with CBM, and
the electron is shared between e2↓ and the conduction
band states. Indeed, in this limit the density of states at
the CBM is ”inﬁnitely” larger compared with the ﬁnite
DOS induced by one Fe impurity. With the increasing
Fe concentration, both the e2↓ and the EF increase in
energy.

The calculated level structure of ”Fe2+” reveals a half-
resonance character of the Fe impurity. As mentioned
above, the term ”half -resonance” is meant here to re-
ﬂect a situation intermediate between a normal donor,
with the donor level in the band gap, and a resonant
donor, with the donor level above the CBM even in the
ionized +1 charge state. Ionization of the two kinds of
donors diﬀers: while the ionization of a normal donor re-
quires a ﬁnite ionization energy, the resonant donor ion-
izes spontaneously providing a free conduction electron
even at zero temperature, see Fig. 4.
Ionization of Fe
is intermediate between those two kinds. Indeed, the d6
conﬁguration of Fe2+ state is not stable and cannot be
achieved, since e2↓ occupied with one electron is above
the (empty) CBM, similar to a resonant donor. How-
ever, a complete autoionization to the q = +1 charge
state cannot occur because the empty e2↓ is below the
(occupied) CBM. In this case the ionization energy is ﬁ-

nite, as schematically depicted in Fig. 4. Figure 4 also
shows that the condition for a donor to be a resonant one
is that the donor level is degenerate with the continuum
of the conduction band not only for q = 0, but also for
q = +1 charge state. The activation energy is zero when
the q = +1 donor level coincides with the bottom of the
conduction band.

To ﬁnd the ionization energy of band conductivity, the
calculations with ﬁxed occupation matrices at the Γ point
are performed for q = 0. The ionization energy is ob-
tained from the total energy diﬀerence between the ﬁnal
state of the system, which is the Fe3+ with one electron
in the conduction band (i.e., the fully autoionized Fe2+)
and the initial state, ”Fe2+”. The calculated value is
0.4 eV. Inclusion of atomic relaxations in the ﬁnal state
lowers this value by about 0.2 eV. We point out, however,
that these calculations are performed for the relatively
high Fe concentration 2.8 %, and employing the Γ point
only, which can introduce errors of the order of 0.2 eV.
Moreover, the calculated ionization energy is expected
to depend on the U (Fe) correction.
In fact, according
to Fig. 4, the energy of e2↓ increases with the increasing
U (Fe), which reduces the ionization energy. However,
even for the large U (Fe)=6 eV, the e2↓ of Fe3+ energy is
below the CBM, and consequently the ionization energy
does not vanish.

D.

s,p-d coupling

The calculated spin splitting of the conduction band
∆Ec = Ec↓ −Ec↑ and the valence band ∆Ev = Ev↓ −Ev↑,
produced by the coupling of Fe with the host ZnO states,
can be used to estimate the s,p-d coupling. Within the
mean-ﬁeld approximation, the exchange constants are ex-
pressed by52

N0α = ∆Ec/(x < S >), N0β = ∆Ev/(x < S >), (1)

where x is the concentration of the Fe ions and < S > is
one half of the computed magnetization.

The calculated values are given in Table I. As it follows
from the Table, the constant N0α ∼ 0.4 eV for both
charge states. This is similar to the typical value, 0.2 eV,
found in II-VI compounds.53 Moreover, N0α does not
depend on the U (Fe).
In contrast, the constant N0β
is strongly dependent on both the Fe charge state and
the U (Fe). For q = 0 and U (Fe)= 0, the calculated
N0β ∼ 0.5 eV, which is smaller than typical iron-hole
exchange integrals for II-VI compounds.54–57, but of the
same order as eﬀective exchange integrals reported for
wide gap DMSs.8,9,58–62 With the increasing U (Fe), t2↑
approaches the valence band (see Fig. 3), which increases
the spin splitting of the VBM, and N0β reaches 2.0 eV
for U (Fe)= 4 eV. On the other hand, evaluation of N0β
for q = +1 is obscured by the energetic proximity of the
VBM and t2↑.
Indeed, as it follows from DOS shown
in Fig. 1, for q = +1 the t2↑ state is degenerate with
the top of the valence band, and therefore its coupling
with the host valence states is very pronounced. Also
a direct inspection of the wave functions of the states
close to the VBM reveals the strong hybridization, which
makes it impossible to clearly distinguish between band
states and Fe-induced states. The mixing of states takes
place for all values of U (Fe). Consequently, the limited
accuracy of the supercell method together with the error
bars related with the value of U (Fe) etc. are of the order
of 0.15 eV, which is too much for reliable calculations of
N0β for q = +1.

Regarding the sign of the interaction, we ﬁnd that con-
duction electrons are ferromagnetically coupled with the
Fe impurities, as expected for the direct exchange cou-
pling.53 The Fe-hole coupling has the kinetic exchange
character,53 driven by the hybridization of the Fe and
host states. For q = 0 the coupling of holes with the Fe
is ferromagnetic. For q = +1 the coupling changes the
sign. In this case, N0β is formally evaluated from the spin
splitting of the highest valence states. Such an approach
corresponds to the interpretation of luminescence exper-
iments, in which one determines the spin splitting of the
highest valence states involved in the exciton recombina-
tion regardless of their actual orbital composition.

The coupling between the Fe and O ﬁrst nearest neigh-
bors induces magnetic moment on O ions. The calculated
magnetic moments are ∼ 0.09 µB for q = 0 and ∼ 0.19 µB
for q = +1. The magnetic moment of the Fe is ∼ 3.95 µB
for q = 0, and ∼ 4.17 µB for q = +1. The correspond-
ing total magnetic moments are ∼ 4.3 µB for q = 0 and
∼ 5.0 µB for q = +1. In the former case, the total mo-
ment is non-integer, since the additional electron that
should occupy e2↓ partially spills to the bottom of the
conduction band. In the Fe2+ case the spin of the sixth
d(Fe) electron is antiparallel to the remaining ones, thus
both the total magnetic moment and the contributions
from Fe and O neighbors are lower than for the Fe3+
case. The results hardly depend on the U (Fe) value.

The wave functions at the Γ point of the VBM, e2↑, t2↑,
and the CBM are shown in Fig. 5 for q = 0 and U (Fe)= 0.
As expected, the top of the valence band is composed

top of the valence band, (b) e2↑, (c) t2↑, and (d) the bottom

of p(O) and of d(Fe), while the contribution of d(Zn)
is less pronounced. The hybridization is weak, which is
consistent with the small value of N0β for q = 0. The two
gap states are dominated by d(Fe), but the contribution
of the host states, mostly the O nearest neighbors, is
clearly visible. The hybridization is more pronounced in
the case of t2↑.
(The structure of both e2↑ and t2↑ is
the same as for Mn in GaN,63,64 while the contribution
of the Fe to the VBM in ZnO is lower than that of the
Mn in GaN.) The wave functions of the two Fe-induced
e2↓ and t2↓ states, degenerate with the conduction band
continuum, are very similar to those of the spin up e2↑
and t2↑ (see Fig. 5) and thus are not shown.

Finally, the conduction band edge, formed by s(O)
states and small contribution of s(Zn/Fe) states, is prac-
tically not perturbed by the d(Fe). The coupling with the
conduction states occurs via the direct exchange mecha-
nism,53 and does not necessitate hybridization.

Summing up the theory part of the paper, the Fe in
ZnO is a half-resonant donor. The occupied e2↓ level of
the Fe2+ is above the CBM, which makes the 2+ charge
state unstable. The levels of the Fe3+ are, in turn, 1.2 eV

lower than those of ”Fe2+”. In particular, the empty e2↓
is located in the gap. This large diﬀerence in the level en-
ergies stems from the strong intra-center Coulomb repul-
sion between the d(Fe) electrons caused by the localiza-
tion of their wave functions. The actual energy of e2↓ is
determined self-consistently by the charge self-regulation
mechanism, which implies a fractional occupancy of the
e2↓ state. The calculated resonant character of the Fe
does not depend on the choice of the value of U (Fe) for
the range 0 < U (Fe)< 6 eV. Paradoxically, in spite of the
fact that the e2↓ energy of a neutral Fe ion is degener-
ate with the conduction band continuum, i.e., is situated
above the CBM, its ionization requires a non-zero energy.
Finally, ZnO doped with ﬁnite concentrations of the Fe
is n-type, as indicated by the ﬁnite DOS at the Fermi
level.

The half-resonance character of the Fe in ZnO found
here is similar to that obtained for the early transition
metal impurities, Sc, Ti, and V, which were predicted
to be resonant donors in ZnO, with the (+/0) transi-
tion level in the conduction band.26 Interestingly, also in
the zero band gap semiconductor alloy Hg1−xCdxSe with
x < 0.4, Fe was experimentally found to be a resonant
donor in the conduction band.65 The resonance character
of Fe was inferred from optical absorption and transport
measurements.66,67

The s,p-d coupling constant N0α, about 0.4 eV, does
not depend on the Fe charge state. N0β is non-vanishing
as well, but it depends on the charge state of Fe:
it
amouts to about 1 eV for the Fe2+, while for the Fe3+ it
is expected to be higher since t2↑ is degenerate with the
VBM and thus strongly hybridized.

III.

SAMPLES

Studied ZnO layers doped with the Fe ions are pro-
duced by a spray pyrolysis method on quartz or glass
substrates,68 with a respective thicknesses of ∼600 nm
and ∼150 nm and concentration of the Fe ions of around
x = 0.2%. The layers exhibit a polycrystalline structure
(∼100 nm grain size). A layer of pure ZnO is also grown
in the same conditions as the Fe doped ones.

X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) characterization shows that
the samples exhibit the crystalline structure of the hexag-
onal ZnO (see Fig. 6). The Bragg peak (002) is domi-
nant, suggesting that the (002) plane growth rate is the
fastest one. The plane (002) is arranged parallel to the
substrate, i. e., the preferential c-axis orientation is per-
pendicular to the ﬁlm plane for all the samples.

A. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measure-
ments are performed at X-band at room temperature.
Two relatively sharp resonance lines are observed at mag-
netic ﬁelds around 3000 G, superimposed on a broad
band spectrum (see Fig. 7). The resonance ﬁelds agree
very well with the ones reported in a previous study for
the −1/2 ↔ 1/2 ﬁne structure transition of isolated, sub-
stitutional Fe3+ ion (S=5/2) in ZnO powders.69 Due to
the random orientation of the polycrystallites in our sam-
ple two isotropic lines are detected corresponding to the
extreme points of the angular dependence, instead of a
single angularly dependent EPR signal associated with
the 1/2 ↔ 1/2 transition.70 Since the linewidth of the
weaker ±5/2 ↔ ±3/2 and ±3/2 ↔ ±1/2 ﬁne struc-
ture transitions is much more sensitive to variations of
the polycrystallite size, the corresponding resonances are
smeared out and contribute only to the broad band spec-
trum. The agreement of the measured EPR spectrum
with that expected for the Fe3+ ion in ZnO69 conﬁrms
the presence of the iron ions with the 3+ valency in the
studied samples. We note that 2+ ions are not detected
in the EPR measurements, and in consequence their pres-
ence can not be veriﬁed using this method. However,
as will be shown below, a good description of the de-
pendence of magnetization and of the MCD on magnetic
ﬁeld is obtained using a Brillouin function as for the Fe3+
ions.

DOPANT IN ZNO

In order to determine the valence state of iron ions
incorporated into the samples, we investigate magnetic
and conductivity behaviour of the studied layers.

Magnetization measurements are performed with the
use of a SQUID-type magnetometer in the temperature
range 2-300 K and magnetic ﬁelds up to 7 T. The mea-
sured magnetic moment of each sample is a sum of para-

data, line: ﬁt following Eq. 3.

magnetic moment of the Fe3+ ions, a diamagnetic con-
tribution from the ZnO layer and the substrate, and a
possible contribution of unintentional impurities. There-
fore the measured magnetization can be expressed in the
form:

Mexp(B, T ) = M(Zn,F e)O(B, T ) + χdiaB + C,

(2)

where M(Zn,F e)O(B, T ) is a total magnetic moment of
the Fe3+ ions in ZnO matrix, χdia is the sum of dia-
magnetic susceptibility of ZnO layer and of the substrate
(assumed to be temperature independent in the studied
temperature range) and C represents a contribution from
possible precipitates of secondary phases.

We note that in our case diamagnetic contribution
dominates the others since the mass of the magnetic layer
is only a tiny fraction of the total mass of the sample. In
such a case a precise value of χdia of the sample is cru-
cial. A careful analysis of the data reveals the absence
of ferromagnetic secondary phases (e.g., Fe-rich aggre-
gates) in all of the studied samples. This is in contrast
to what was reported previously for the (Zn,Fe)O71 and
other Fe-doped wide band gap semiconductors, e.g., for
(Ga,Fe)N.72,73 Consequently, the term C in the Eq. 2
will be neglected.74 Having in mind the EPR identiﬁca-
tion of the Fe impurity as the Fe3+, with spin S = 5/2
and L = 0, we assume M(Zn,F e)O(B, T ) in the form:

M(Zn,F e)O(B, T ) = AgµBSBS=5/2(B, T ),

(3)

where BS=5/2(B, T ) is the Brillouin function for spin
S = 5/2, g is g-factor and A is the number of the Fe
centers. Possible interaction between the Fe3+ ions is
neglected here due to their expected low concentration.
In order to extract M(Zn,F e)O(B, T ) from the total mag-
netization of the samples Mexp(B, T ), the dominating
diamagnetic contribution (i.e. χdia B) is subtracted us-
ing the following procedure. At T = 300 K the Brillouin
function in Eq. 3 is a linear function of the magnetic

ﬁeld. So that ﬁtting of the Mexp(B, T = 300 K) by a
straight line provides a susceptibility of the sample, which
is in practice solely a diamagnetic susceptibility (a resid-
ual paramagnetic contribution originating from the Fe3+
ions is negligibly small with respect to the total sample
susceptibility due to a relatively high temperature and
a small density of the Fe3+ dopant). The diamagnetic
susceptibility evaluated in this way from the data in the
ﬁeld range 2 T < B < 7 T (χdia = −4.95 × 10−6) is used
for evaluation of M(Zn,F e)O(B, T ) according to Eq. 3.

In Fig.

8,

both the

(i.e.,
experimental data
(i.e.,
Mexp(B, T = 2 K) − χdiaB) and the ﬁt
AgµBSBS=5/2(B, T = 2 K) are given for an example
sample grown on quartz substrate. Parameter A being
the only ﬁtting parameter provides the information about
the actual molar concentration of the Fe3+ ions in the lay-
ers. It attains x = 0.2%, in agreement with the results of
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. This value
is typical for the studied layers. We note that the mag-
netization measurements conﬁrm the 3+ state of the iron
ions, what points toward high eﬃciency of compensation
and/or the autoionisation of the ions predicted by the
theory.

C. DC-resistivity and Hall eﬀect

Electrical contacts on thin ﬁlms are deposited using a
conductive silver paint. Contact ohmicity is systemati-
cally veriﬁed by I-V characteristics. DC-resistivity and
Hall eﬀect are measured in a Van der Pauw conﬁgura-
tion in the temperature range from 80 K to 300 K and
for magnetic ﬁelds perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane varied
from 0 T to 1.6 T in a custom designed high impedance
measurement setup.

The samples exhibit a semiconducting behavior.
Namely, the resistivity increases with the temperature

decrease. At room temperature, resistivity ρ of the 1%
(Zn,Fe)O on glass substrate equals to 6.6 × 103Ω · cm.
In conductivity vs inverse temperature plots, two diﬀer-
ent regions of the conductivity are distinguished: (i) for
300 K down to 200 K, where conduction due to the tem-
perature activation to the band dominates, (ii) for tem-
peratures below 200 K, where the near neighbor hop-
ping mechanism becomes dominant. The activation en-
ergy of band conductivity has been determined to be
140 meV.68,75 Negative sign of Hall voltage is found for
all layers in Hall eﬀect measurements at room temper-
ature. This implies that the samples, independently if
deposited on glass or on fused silica, are of n-type. For
pure ZnO electron concentration n = 5.4 × 1015 cm−3
and mobility µ = 1.9 cm2/Vs are found, while for the
1% (Zn,Fe)O n reaches 1.5 × 1016 cm−3 and mobility de-
creases due to the presence of scattering centers down to
µ = 0.5 cm2/Vs. A natural explanation for the increase
of the density of free electrons upon the iron doping is
that at least some part of iron ions are donors, which
are not fully compensated by the native acceptors. As
indicated by previous experimental theoretical76,77 and
experimental25,78 works, a likely source of native accep-
tors in ZnO is a Zn vacancy.

EXPERIMENT: EVIDENCE FOR S,P-D

EXCHANGE INTERACTION IN (ZN,FE)O

The samples are placed at pumped helium tempera-
ture inside a cryostat equipped with a superconducting
coil magnet. The emission is non-resonantly excited at
3.81 eV (325 nm) using a continuous wave He-Cd laser.
The excitation beam is focused to a 0.1 mm spot on the
sample surface. The signal is detected by a grating spec-
trometer and a CCD camera (0.1 meV of overall spectral
resolution) in the case of time-integrated measurements.
Circular polarizations of the signal are resolved.

The reﬂectivity and PL measurements are performed
in the Faraday conﬁguration in magnetic ﬁeld of up 10
T, in temperature range from 1.5 K to 50 K, with a halo-
gen lamp serving as a source of the ultraviolet light. The
MCD is determined based on the acquired reﬂectivity
spectra as M CD = (Rσ+ - Rσ−)/(Rσ+ + Rσ−), where
Rσ+ and Rσ− represents intensity of the reﬂectivity spec-
trum in the σ+ and σ− polarization, respectively.

A. Magnetic Circular Dichroism

Optical transitions of three excitons, A, B and C, are
present in the reﬂectivity spectra of the studied (Zn,Fe)O
layers, as expected for a wurtzite structure semiconduc-
tor (see Fig. 9a)). Magnetic ﬁeld-induced splittings are
small with respect to the transitions linewidths, what
precludes tracing of the excitonic shifts after the ﬁeld is
applied. However, a clear MCD signal related to excitons
is observed in the magnetic ﬁeld. The MCD spectra de-

9

termined based on the reﬂectivity spectra at B = 9 T for
temperatures of 1.5 K, 3.5 K, 10 K and 50 K are shown
in Fig. 9b).

Integrated MCD intensity79 (IMCD) is calculated as
an integral under the MCD curve in the region of A and
B excitonic transitions. The IMCD increases with the
magnetic ﬁeld following a Brillouin-like dependence with
a saturation at around 3 T and around 7 T for 1.5 K
and 3.5 K, respectively (see Fig. 9c)). As it is seen, the
IMCD is well described by the paramagnetic Brillouin
function with the Land´e factor g = 2.0062 (taken follow-
ing Ref. 69) and spin 5/2 (as for the Fe3+ ions), without
any free ﬁtting parameters (the saturation value of IMCD
is determined once for the 1.5 K case and then kept con-
stant in the case of ﬁts for 3.5 K and 10 K.) In the case
of a reference sample of pure ZnO an expected linear de-
pendence of IMCD on magnetic ﬁeld originating form the
Zeeman splitting of bands is found (not shown).

Below the saturation, the MCD magnitude decreases
with the increasing temperature following a Curie para-
magnetic dependence (see inset to Fig. 9c)). This indi-
cates that abundance of the Fe2+ ions in our samples is
negligible and/or that the magnitude of s,p-d interaction
is much larger in the case of the Fe3+ than of the Fe2+
ions. If the Fe2+ ions played a dominant role, the Van-
Vleck type paramagnetism80,81 would dominate and the
decrease of IMCD with the temperature would be negli-
gible for temperatures of up to around 50 K. Apparently,
it is not the case. Thus, the MCD provides a conﬁrma-
tion for the presence of the Fe3+ ions and for the s,p-d
interaction between the Fe3+ ions and the band carriers
in the (Zn,Fe)O.

B. Magneto-Photoluminescence

Figure 10a) shows PL spectra in magnetic ﬁeld B =
0 T and B = 10 T recorded in two circular polarizations
of the light, σ+ and σ−, for the (Zn,Fe)O sample. The
contributions from a bound exciton at around 3360 meV
and donor acceptor pairs (DAP) at around 3320 meV are
identiﬁed following Ref. 82

Figure 10b) shows a degree of the circular polariza-
tion P determined from spectra in magnetic ﬁeld from
0 T to 10 T for (Zn, Fe)O samples. P is determined as:
P = (Iσ+ - Iσ−)/(Iσ+ + Iσ−), where Iσ+ and Iσ− rep-
resent intensity of the PL spectrum in the σ+ and σ−
polarization, respectively. A high degree of polarization
P is observed in the spectral region of the bound exci-
ton and of the DAP at energy of around 3365 meV and
3320 meV, respectively. P increases with the magnetic
ﬁeld and saturates at around B = 5 T.

Integrated degree of polarization IP , deﬁned as the
area under the degree of polarization curve in the exci-
tonic region, is plotted as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld
in Fig. 10c) together with a paramagnetic Brillouin func-
tion ﬁt. The ﬁtting paremeters are the saturation value
and the eﬀective temperature. The best ﬁt is obtained

for factor g = 2.0062,69 the eﬀective temperature T =
3.8 K and spin 5/2 as for the Fe3+ ions. As it is seen the
dependence is well described by the Brillouin function.
This strongly suggests that the P is directly proportional
to the sample magnetization. We have checked that the
increased temperature with respect to the temperature
of experiment (1.8 K) results from the sample heating
with the excitation beam. The dependence on magnetic
ﬁeld is qualitatively the same also for DAP (not shown)
indicating that qualitatively the same mechanism is re-
sponsible for the eﬀects observed for the bound exciton
and the DAP.

A Lorentzian curve is ﬁtted to the exciton transition
at around 3360 meV, providing information on parame-
ters of the transition as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld.
The PL intensity determined that way for the (Zn,Fe)O
for σ+ and σ− polarizations is shown in the inset to
Fig. 10c). The PL intensity increases with the mag-
netic ﬁeld in both polarizations. A similar eﬀect on
the ﬁeld was previously observed in DMS structures and
nanostructurues, e.g., involving Mn.9,83–85 As in previous
works,9,83–86 we attribute the emission intensity increase
to the magnetic ﬁeld induced reduction of eﬃciency of
non-radiative exciton recombination assisted by Auger

excitation of the Fe3+ ion. In the absence of the magnetic
ﬁeld, band carriers and the Fe3+ ions are spin degener-
ate making eﬃciency of the Auger process independent
of spin. However, the magnetic ﬁeld lowers the number
of spin arrangements of the electron and the Fe3+ ion
that fulﬁll the spin conservation rule in the process, and
thus it decreases the overall eﬃciency of the non-radiative
Auger recombination. We note that the σ+ polarized
emission increases more than the σ− polarized one. Sim-
ilar as in the previous study of (Zn,Mn)O (Ref.[9]), it
can be explained in terms of spin-dependent exciton for-
mation involving free and bound exciton states, as well
as A and B excitons relaxation involving change of the
exciton symmetry. For pure ZnO, the intensity of the PL
linearly increases for σ+ and decreases for σ− in the mag-
netic ﬁeld (not shown) due to polarization of the carriers
induced by the Zeeman splitting of bands.

We ﬁnd also that the linewidth of the bound exciton
in (the Zn,Fe)O decreases nonlinearly with the magnetic
ﬁeld in both polarizations with a saturation at around
4 T (not shown). The eﬀect is stronger for the σ+ than
for the σ− polarization. We attribute the linewidth nar-
rowing to a reduction of the ﬂuctuations of the magneti-
zation of the Fe3+ ions induced by the magnetic ﬁeld.87

function of magnetic ﬁeld of up to 10 T for (Zn,Fe)O sample and a reference, a pure ZnO sample (points) along with the ﬁt

Mutually opposite shifts in the magnetic ﬁeld of bound
excitons originating from bands of symmetry Γ7 and
Γ9 (A and B excitons) also contribute to the linewidth
narrowing.9

To summarize this part, the PL results provide a strong
support for the conclusions drawn from the reﬂectivity
measurements, unequivocally conﬁrming presence of the
ion-carrier s,p-d interaction in the studied system.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Theoretical and experimental analyses of the electronic
structure of Fe ions in ZnO and of the magnetic proper-
ties of ZnO:Fe were conducted. Both the valency of Fe
and the energies of Fe states are determined by the oc-
cupancy of the Fe e2↓ donor level. The GGA+U calcula-
tions reveal that the Fe2+ charge state is unstable, which
is driven by the strong Coulomb repulsion between d(Fe)
Indeed, for the Fe3+, e2↓ is an empty gap
electrons.
state below the bottom of the conduction band. With
the occupancy increasing from 0 for the Fe3+ to 1 for the
Fe2+, its energy increases, and it becomes a resonance
degenerate with the conduction band continuum. Thus,

the e2↓ level of the Fe2+ occupied with one electron is
above the bottom of the (empty) conduction band. Con-
sequently, the electron occupying this level autoionizes to
the bottom of the conduction band. The autoionization
is partial, with the electron shared between the conduc-
tion band and the e2↓ doublet. The e2↓ energy and its
occupancy are determined self-consistently by a charge
self-regulation mechanism. The charge state of Fe is in-
termediate between 3+ than 2+. The full ionization of
Fe, corresponding to the Fe3+ and an electron in the con-
duction band, requires energy of about 0.2 eV. Thus, Fe
ion in ZnO is a half-resonance donor, since a genuine res-
onant donor is characterized by the fact that the donor
level is in the conduction band continuum for both neu-
tral and positive charge states.

In parallel, EPR, magnetometry, reﬂectivity, magneto-
photoluminescence, and conductivity experiments were
conducted on polycrystalline ZnO layers with Fe content
below 0.1 atomic per cent. The results of the EPR mea-
surements reveal the presence of the substitutional Fe
with the 3+ valency in the studied samples. The lay-
ers magnetization determined in SQUID measurements
is well described with the paramagnetic Brillouin func-
tion as for the Fe3+ ions, what demonstrates that the

dominant Fe charge state is 3+. Consistently with this
ﬁnding, the magnetic ﬁeld dependencies in magnetoopti-
cal response of the samples determined in the reﬂectivity
and PL measurements are proportional to the measured
magnetization. Namely, they are described by the para-
magnetic Brillouin function determined as for the Fe3+
ions and they obey the paramagnetic Curie law, charac-
teristic of the Fe3+ in ZnO, rather than the paramagnetic
Van Vleck law expected for the Fe2+.

According to the conductivity measurements, the sam-
ples are n-type, with the room temperature electron con-
centration of about 1016 cm−3.
Importantly, the mea-
sured activation energy of conductivity of 0.14 eV is in
a reasonable agreement with the theoretically estimated
value of Fe ionization energy. The low electron concen-
trations indicate a high degree of compensation of Fe
donors, most possibly by the zinc vacancies. The pres-
ence of compensating acceptors is also reﬂected by the
DAP recombination line seen in the luminescence.

Finally, the calculations indicate that the coupling con-
stant N0α of conduction electrons with Fe is 0.4 eV,
somewhat higher than typical values. The exchange cou-
pling constant for holes strongly depends on the Fe charge

state: for the Fe2+ the N0β is of the same order as re-
ported for other wide gap DMSs and ferromagnetic, while
in the case of the Fe3+ the N0β, as measured by the spin
splitting of the valence band top, is an order of mag-
nitude larger, and antiferromagnetic. The pronounced
magnetoopical eﬀects observed in the MCD and the PL
conﬁrm a presence of the s,p-d interaction between the
band carriers and the Fe3+ ions in the studied system.

The properties resulting from the Fe doping indicate
the (Zn,Fe)O as a promising material for implementation
in functional spintronic devices.
