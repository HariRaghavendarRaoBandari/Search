Abstract. The central regions of galaxies show the presence of super massive black holes
and/or very dense stellar clusters. Both such objects seem to follow similar host-galaxy
correlations, suggesting that they are members of the same family of Compact Massive Objects.
Here we investigate a huge data collection of Compact Massive Objects properties to correlate
them with absolute magnitude, velocity dispersion and mass of their host galaxies. We draw
also some preliminary astrophysical conclusions.

1. Introduction
The link between the formation and evolution of galaxies and those of their central region
is a debated topic. Various studies suggest that massive galaxies, both elliptical and spiral,
harbor a SuperMassive Black Hole (SMBH) in their centers, with masses between 106 − 109 M⊙.
The SMBH masses correlate with various properties of their host galaxies, such as the bulge
luminosity [1], mass [2], velocity dispersion [3], and light proﬁle concentration [4].

Galaxies across the entire Hubble sequence also show the presence of massive and compact
stellar clusters referred to Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs). NSCs are bright (4 mag brighter than
an ordinary globular cluster), massive (106 − 107 M⊙) and very dense systems, with half light
radius of 2-5 pc [5]. In elliptical galaxies, the NSCs are also referred to as Resolved Stellar Nuclei
(RSN). All the NSCs contain an old stellar population (age > 1 Gyr), and, in some cases, show
the presence of a young stellar population (age < 100 Myr) [6].

The models of formation and evolution of NSCs are still under debate.
Ref. [7] showed that, despite their diﬀerent morphologies, some galaxies of the Local Group
present both a NSC and a SMBH. In such case, the SMBH is surrounded by the NSC. Those
objects follow a similar host-galaxy correlation [8], suggesting that they are members of the
same family of Compact Massive Objects (CMOs). CMOs constitute a interplay between either
SMBH or a compact stellar structure (NSCs, Nuclear Stellar Disk or Resolved Stellar Nuclei).
[9] found a separation in mass between galaxies that host a SMBH (those with
M > 5 × 109 M⊙) and galaxies that host a NSC (with M < 5 × 109 M⊙). A transition
region exists between 108 and 1010 M⊙ in which NSCs and SMBHs can coexist [10, 11].

Ref.

A good example is the Milky Way (MW), where a 4× 106 M⊙ black hole coexists with an

NSC∼4 times more massive (MN SC ≈ 1.5 × 107 M⊙).

Studies in the literature also showed that the NSC mass versus the host galaxy velocity
dispersion (σ) relation is roughly the same observed for SMBHs. Ref. [12] claimed, instead, that
the MN SC − σ relation is shallower for NSCs (MN SC ∝ σ1.5) than for SMBHs. Moreover, it has

been shown that the NSC masses (MN SC ∝ σ1.5) correlate better with the bulge mass, while
the SMBH mass displays a tighter correlation with the total mass of the galaxy [13].

Here we investigate these scaling correlations for a set of NSC and SMBH data wider than

what already studied in the literature.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data base used for building our
sample, and Section 3 describes the methodology. The results and their discussion are presented
in Section 4.

2. The database
Ref. [14] selected 43 galaxies of the Fornax Cluster with early-type morphologies (E, S0, SB0,
dE, dE,N or dS0,N), using the F 475W and F 850LP bandpasses of the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Advanced Camera of Survey (ACS). 31 galaxies out of 43, representing 72 ± 13% of
their sample, are nucleated with the majority of the nuclei bluer than their host galaxies. This
approach gives two apparent magnitudes for the nuclei, in the g and z band. The g band values
were in this work, because the level of nucleation is slightly larger in this band.

Ref. [15] analysed the nuclei of a sample of 100 early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster of
morphological types E, S0, dE, dEN and dS0. The images were taken with the ACS instrument
in Wide Field Channel (WFC) using a combination of the F475W and F850LP ﬁlters, roughly
equivalent to the g and z bands, in the Sloan Sky Survey photometric system. The authors
also concluded that nucleated galaxies are more concentrated toward the center of Virgo cluster.
Some nuclei of ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) are bluer than the underlying galaxies and
a central excess is more apparent in the g band rather than in the redder bandpass.

Ref. [16] presented the properties of 228 nuclear stellar cluster in nearby late-type disk galaxies
observed with the WFPC2/Hubble Space Telescope (HST/WFPC2), in B and I bands, with
distance ≤ 40 Mpc and distance modulus ≤ 33 mag. The authors avoided the most luminous
bulges and all ANGs to build the sample, because the presence of strong ANGs would complicate
the NSC characterization. They also concluded that largest and brightest NSCs occupy the
regime between Ultra Compact Dwarf (UCD) and early-type galaxies.

Ref. [17] analysed the light proﬁle of 200 early-type dwarf galaxies with magnitudes 16.0 <
mF814W < 22.6 mag using the HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey. NSCs are detected in 80% of
the galaxies, thus doubling the sample of HST-observed early-type dwarf galaxies with nuclear
star clusters.

We also included in our sample 89 galaxies having a dynamical detection of the central black
hole mass. We took information from a catalog presented by [18], and also from a sample
presented by [19].

3. Method
Our aim was to estimate CMOs masses for each of the catalogues presented in the previous
section of the paper, and compare such values with the mass, velocity dispersion and absolute
B magnitude of their host galaxies.

The stellar M/L ratio vs color correlation given by [20] was used to determine the CMOs

masses.

The CMOs mass values of ACS Fornax and Virgo Cluster Surveys were obtained by
the g − z color correlation. Georgiev’s work did not provide the B − V color correlation
(reddening corrected), for the HST/WFPC2 archive nuclei. Such values were provided in the
Johnson/Cousin photometric system and our reference system is the AB one. We used the
correlation given by [21] to do the conversion:

B = B(AB) + 0.163(±0.004),

(1)

V = V (AB) + 0.044(±0.004).

(2)

The magnitudes for the NSCs given for Coma Cluster are only in the F 814W band, which
is equilavent to the IC band (AB photometry system). The authors did not provide the color-
correlation for this sample. We used the CMOs color-correlation average of the previous sample
to get our ﬁnal results.

The galaxy masses for the Fornax and Virgo clusters were computed using the virial theorem:

Mgal =

βReﬀ σ2

G

,

(3)

where G is the gravitational constant, σ is the velocity dispersion, Reﬀ is the eﬀective radius of
the galaxies, and β = 5.

For the ACS Fornax Cluster Survey the eﬀective radius values for the galaxies used were
provided by [22]. There are no available estimates of the eﬀective radius for FCC 2006, FCC
1340, and FCC 21. The values of the eﬀective radius for galaxies in the ACSVCS were given in
their respective catalog.

To compute the galaxy masses in the HST/WFCP2 archive we used the same magnitude vs
B −V color correlation for the galaxies and, after the conversion between the reference magnitude
systems, from Johnson/Cousin photometric system into the AB system for both bands (E.1 and
E.2), we obtained our ﬁnal results using the stellar M/L ratio vs color correlation formula.

The values for the eﬀective radii are not provided in the ACS Coma Cluster (ACSCCS)
catalog. Thus, for it we used the galaxies color-correlation average of the previous sample and
we applied such values in stellar M/L ratio vs color correlation formula.

The velocity dispersion values for the galaxies in the Fornax and Virgo Cluster, and those in
the HST/WFCP2 archive were taken from the Hyperleda Website1; for the Coma Cluster the
values are given by [23, 24].

Ref. [14, 16] work also provide the values for the apparent B magnitude for the galaxies in
Fornax Cluster and HST/WFCP2 archive, respectively. Such values, for the Virgo Cluster, were
taken from [6]. For the Coma Cluster we converted the values of apparent IC magnitude into
apparent B magnitude:

F 475W − F 814W = −0.036(F 475W + 18) + 1.13,

(4)

where F 475W and F 814W are equivalent to B and IC bands, respectively.
All the values for the SMBH database were taken in the literature, such as absolute B

magnitude [25, 26], velocity dispersion [27], and masses of their host galaxies [25].

4. Comparative discussion of results
Our results are plotted in Figs. 1-4. The existence of evident correlations indicates a direct
link among large galactic spatial scales and the much smaller scales of nuclear environment. We
have ﬁtted scaling correlations connecting the CMOs mass to various properties of their host
galaxies: MB, σ, and galaxy mass. To obtain the ﬁnal value of the two ﬁt parameters, a and b,
for each galaxy cluster, we applied a linear best ﬁt, i.e. least χ2 method. Thus the values shown
in Table 1 represent the best approximation recoverable.

NSCs are more common in fainter galaxies, with magnitudes between −21 ≤ MB ≤ −13,
than in brighter galaxies as shown in Figs. 1 and 4. The same behaviour was already predicted
by [15].

The presence of NSCs is much more frequent in galaxies with lower velocity dispersion,

σ ≤ 100 km/s (Fig. 2).

Galaxies with larger masses have more massive CMOs (Fig. 3). It is likely that MBHs and
compact stellar structures in these galaxies interacted in the same way during their formation.

5. Conclusions
We studied three diﬀerent scaling correlations with an updated set of data involving CMOs mass
and host galaxies properties. NSCs (or CMOs and SMBH) appear to not to follow the same
scaling relation respect to the host galaxy mass, in agreement with the previous studies. Our
list of ﬁndings are:

(i) Galaxies brighter than MB = −18 host SMBHs, and the existence of such objects in bright
galaxies reconcile with the existence, in most of the cases, of an AGN. The lack of NSCs in
faint galaxies may be related to the small number of globular clusters in some galaxies, as
in the Local Group, where globular clusters are not found in stellar spheroids fainter than
MB ∼ −12.5.

(ii) We reconﬁrmed that, with our updated set of data, as one moves to fainter galaxies, the
nuclei become the dominant feature while MBHs tend to become less common and, perhaps,
entirely disappear at the fainter end [10].

(iii) The M N SCs−σ correlation shows a slope between 1.5 and 3, which is in good agreement

with that obtained by [1], excluding HST/WFCP2 archive sample.

(iv) It is unclear what exactly the result of any interaction may be: (1) the presence of a single
SMBH may evaporate the compact stellar structure, (2) a single or binary SMBH may heat
and erode the surrounding compact stellar structure.
