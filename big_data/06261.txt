In order to approximate non-Markovian dynamics encountered in the theory of quantum open
systems, a new multiple-scale perturbation method is generalized to integro-diﬀerential equations.
Two (primary and auxiliary) time scales are particularly identiﬁed in the strong-coupling regime
where the open system and its environment are strongly interacted with evident non-Markovianity
being revealed. The new method provides acceptable approximation compared with traditional
perturbation methods for generically structured reservoirs and indicates correct oscillatory and
decay behaviors, helping us to recognize non-Markovianity in a perturbative way.

INTRODUCTION

It is unimaginable to study modern quantum dynamics
without referring to the theory of quantum open systems
nowadays. The quantum open system [1], as a statistical
dynamic model, has induced tremendous new theoretical
ideas and concepts such as dissipation and decoher-
ence [2, 3], sudden death of entanglement [4, 5] and non-
Markovianity [6–8] which are followed with increasing
interest these days, and has directly or indirectly
conducted experiments in many areas of quantum physics
and quantum information, e.g., quantum computation
and communication [9–11], quantum metrology [12],
cavity quantum electrodynamics [13, 14], etc.
It is
understandable that to exactly solve the time-dependent
evolution of a quantum open system must be of
extreme diﬃculty for one has to handle inﬁnite quanta
with interaction between the system and environment,
therefore perturbation approximation is required in most
cases. Apparently, one of the modest perturbation
methods is to use the ordinary diﬀerential perturbation
(ODP) method [15] directly inasmuch as one can solve a
series of Schr¨odinger diﬀerential equations in a complete
Hilbert space of the entire closed system (the open system
plus its environment). One can also consider the problem
within the scenario of Liouville space and derive a master
equation [16, 17] which describes the evolution of density
operator of the open system using the Nakajima-Zwanzig
projection operator perturbation techniques [18, 19]. The
approximate result thus takes the form of a generalized
master equation (GME) [19] or a time-convolutionless
master equation (TCL) [20]. However, the range of
applicability of these traditional perturbation methods
is limited away from the strong-coupling regime where
the system and environment are strongly coupled enough

that non-Markovianity is evidently revealed. This non-
Markovian regime has exhibited many appealing features
like bidirectional exchange of energy and/or coherence as
well as singularity of evolution but has still remained not
fully understood yet, partially because of the failure of
the traditional perturbation methods above.

As we shall see,

It seems not probable to ﬁnd a useful perturbation
method in the strong-coupling regime, since traditionally
one only chooses the perturbation parameter to represent
the global system-environment interaction strength and
only allows it to be small.
In this paper, however,
we select the dimensionless perturbation parameter α
straight from the spectrum of the environment instead.
Even if diﬀerent types of spectrum result in completely
diﬀerent evolutions [21–23], the asymptotic behaviors
therein are similar as the coupling strength (which α
is negatively correlated with) grows.
In Section II,
we limit the problem to two-level open systems and
thus formulate the evolution as an integro-diﬀerential
equation accordingly.
the non-
unitary and complex dynamics in the strong-coupling
regime implies multiple (time) scales [24]. Hence,
in
Section III, we generalize a new multiple-scale integro-
diﬀerential perturbation method for integro-diﬀerential
equations; a primary time scale T and an auxiliary time
scale τ are specially introduced for the non-Markovian
open-system problem.
In Section IV, we compare
the method with traditional perturbation methods,
examine the non-Markovian behavior, and investigate
the corresponding evolution within diﬀerently structured
reservoirs. Finally, in Section V, the two-level problem
is reconsidered in situations where the dipole-dipole
interaction and more than one photon are involved.
We expect that this multiple-scale perturbation method
not only provides a new mathematical approximation
approach but also contributes to a better knowledge of
the relation between time scales and non-Markovianity
in quantum mechanics [25].

II. TWO-LEVEL OPEN SYSTEM IN THE

STRONG-COUPLING REGIME

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

To gain insight into the dynamics of a two-level open
system, we begin by considering a Hamiltonian in the
interaction picture [1]

k

ωA

HI (t) =

gk (ωA) A† (ωA) Ekei(ωA−ωk)t + h.c.
(1)
which describes an open system A coupled to an
environment E consisting of numerous discrete modes
k. A (ωA) and A† (ωA) are annihilation and creation
operators acting on A where ωA labels possible energy
†
transitions. The operators Ek and E
k labeled by mode
k act on E with ωk the corresponding mode frequency.
gk (ωA) speciﬁes the coupling strength.
In the case of
a two-level system coupled with a quantized radiation
bath, the only transition is allowed by central frequency
ω0 between the two levels, and Eq. (1) is simpliﬁed to

HI (t) = (cid:88)

gkσ+ ⊗ akei(ω0−ωk)t + h.c.

(2)

k

†
where ak and a
k are annihilation and creation operators
in the radiation ﬁeld and σ± Pauli operators [1]. As the
rotating-wave approximation [26] is already applied (i.e.,
the ultra-strong coupling regime [27] is unreachable by
assuming ω0 (cid:28) gk when the frequency of mode k is near
ω0), the photon number remains conserved, and one can
thus introduce independent Hilbert complete subspaces
constructed by vectors with diﬀerent photon numbers

|g(cid:105)A ⊗ |0(cid:105)E;
|e(cid:105)A ⊗ |0(cid:105)E,
|e(cid:105)A ⊗ |1j(cid:105)E,
...

|g(cid:105)A ⊗ |1k(cid:105)E;
|g(cid:105)A ⊗ |1j1k(cid:105)E;

|g(cid:105)A and |e(cid:105)A are the ground and excited states of
the two-level system, respectively. One aims to build
independent sets of integro-diﬀerential equations from
these subspaces by applying the Schr¨odinger equation to
the entire closed system A ⊗ E [1]. We further restrain
the problem by handling at most one photon in the
entire system, and the evolution of therein restrained
wave function |ψ (t)(cid:105) = C0 (t)|g(cid:105)A ⊗ |0(cid:105)E + C (t)|e(cid:105)A ⊗

of which the Fourier transform is the spectral density
J(ω) of the environment [1]. Diﬀerent shapes of J(ω)
characterize types of radiation bath with completely
diﬀerent behaviors [21]. However, there should be
a universal dimensionless factor, deﬁned as α, distin-
guishing the bandwidth of J(ω) relative to its central
frequency. The spectral density is altered globally from
a Dirac peak to a ﬂat spectrum as α goes from zero to
inﬁnity and shows complicated structure in the range.
A neat example appears in the study of cavity-QED
where we may choose α ∼ Q−1/2 with Q the quality
factor of cavity [26]. Next, for the purpose of applying
perturbation methods independently of dimension scales,
we substitute time quantities in Eq. (3) by introducing
a dimensionless quantity ˜t = γt where γ ∼ J(ω0)
describes the absolute coupling strength between system
and environment. The new dimensionless correlation
function ˜G(˜t, ˜t(cid:48)) takes a general form,

˜G(cid:0)˜t, ˜t(cid:48)(cid:1) ∼ αpG(cid:0)αq(cid:0)˜t − ˜t(cid:48)(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

with integers p, q > 0 accordingly.

The evolution of system A can also be written into the

form of an exact quantum master equation [1],

where ρA(t) = TrE{|ψ(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ(t)|} is the reduced density
operator (suppose ensemble A⊗ E is not mixed w.l.o.g.).
The time-dependent coeﬃcient S(t) = −2(cid:61){ ˙C(t)/C(t)}
represents a Lamb-shift-like renormalized Hamiltonian
and Γ(t) = −2(cid:60){ ˙C(t)/C(t)} represents a dissipator [1].
One can verify that the solution of the upper-level
population of ρA(t) from Eq. (5) is |C(t)|2, in agreement
with Eq. (3).

It is of special interest to consider the diﬀerence of
dynamics between α (cid:29) 1 which gives the weak-coupling
regime and α (cid:28) 1 where the so-called strong-coupling
In the weak-coupling regime, a
regime locates [1].
traditional perturbation method tracing on the small
factor α−1 can always work well, no matter it is
the original equations of quantum states or types of
generalized quantum master equations [16, 18–20] that
are used, or even the Born-Markov approximation [2] is
enough to give a pure and simple result in the Markovian
limit. On the other hand, we will see in Section IV
that none of the perturbation methods are suitable in

the strong-coupling regime where complex evolution and
strong non-Markovianity are involved.

III. MULTIPLE-SCALE

INTEGRO-DIFFERENTIAL PERTURBATION

METHOD

˜G(cid:0)˜t, ˜t(cid:48)(cid:1) when α → 0 and ask for |C(t)| to be physically

It is never easy to ﬁnd a good approximation for the
evolution of Eq. (3). We know C(t) has to change
its behavior from oscillation to pure exponential decay
when α goes from zero to inﬁnity. The presence of both
oscillatory and decay behaviors in the strong-coupling
regime implies non-unitary and complex dynamics.
Besides, one has to take care of the singularity of
smaller than |C(0)| all the time.
Nevertheless, a
typical perturbation method known as the multiple-
scale perturbation method [24] can, more or less, handle
similar problems in ordinary diﬀerential equations. The
procedure of the multiple-scale perturbation method goes
as follows: ﬁrst, one chooses two or more diﬀerent (time)
scales and guesses their forms; second, he/she treats
the scales as independent variables and transforms the
original equations into a series of partial diﬀerential
equations; ﬁnally, he/she needs to make sure higher
perturbation terms diverge no more quickly than former
terms [24]. Based on the same thought, we choose
two possible time scales in our non-Markovian integro-
diﬀerential equation: a primary time scale T and an
auxiliary time scale τ as our ansatz,

T =(cid:0)A0α + A1α3 + ··· + Anα2n+1 + ···(cid:1) t,
τ =(cid:0)B0α2 + B1α4 + ··· + Bnα2n+2 + ···(cid:1) t,

(6)

and also their dimensionless forms ˜τ = γτ and ˜T =
γT . The coeﬃcients {An} and {Bn} are undetermined
yet. The diﬀerential operator acts locally and can
thus be divided into two independent partial diﬀerential
operators,

not satisfy the criteria of Eq. (8) but has singularity
∼ (˜t − ˜t(cid:48))1/2. Now it is assured by Eq. (8) that every
perturbation integral terms in Eq. (3) will eventually
be canceled out by derivatives owing to the cancellation

formula (d/d˜t)n+1(cid:82) d˜t(cid:48)(˜t − ˜t(cid:48))nC(˜t(cid:48)) = n!C(˜t). Finally,

expanding C(˜t) into perturbation terms gives rise to the

The iterating perturbation process with Eq. (9) as our

initial equation contains two steps:

1. Let d/d˜t act on both sides of Eq. (9), cancel out a
”global” integral term, then branch into two time
scales in the form of Eq. (7).

2. Draw terms with the lowest perturbation order
out of Eq. (9) as the corresponding perturbation
equation pending to be solved.

As Eq. (9) becomes more and more ”local” during
iteration, the integral expansions in Eq. (9) will be
canceled in ascending order provided p > 1.
In
other words, we can consider the perturbation order of
as α−n−1 ”locally”. The resulted equation
given by the terms taken from the second step should
merely be diﬀerential and therefore can be solved by
regular multiple-scale methods [24].

The integral operator, on the contrary, acts globally
and cannot be separated independently. To apply the
multiple-scale method to integro-diﬀerential equations,
we therefore have to avoid dealing with integral terms
directly. Here, the trick is to bring Eq. (3) into higher
diﬀerential orders and try to cancel out integral terms
one by one. We ﬁnd the trick can succeed provided the

correlation function ˜G(cid:0)˜t, ˜t(cid:48)(cid:1) is analytic at ˜t = ˜t(cid:48), i.e., its

Unfortunately, some well-studied structured reservoir

power expansion

In this subsection, we introduce the damped Jaynes-
Cummings model
[1] as our ﬁrst important example
since it can be exactly solved by many diﬀerent methods
such as the Laplace transform or the pseudo/quasi-mode
pictures [29]. This cavity-QED model describes the
coupling between two-level system and ﬁeld modes in a
single cavity. The ﬁeld modes are characterized by a
Lorentzian spectral density [1]

when the coupling between the system and reservoir is

coupling strength. The Fourier transform of Eq. (10)

yields the correlation function

γλe−λ(t−t(cid:48)).

(11)

Substituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (3) one derives C (t) =
e−λt/2 [cos (Dt/2) + (λ/D) sin (Dt/2)] with initial condi-
tions given by C (0) = 1 and ˙C(0) = 0 [1]. The parameter

D =(cid:112)2γλ − λ2 distinguishes diﬀerent coupling regimes:

when γ < λ/2, the system and environment are weakly
coupled, and C(t) evolves unidirectionally; when γ >
λ/2, D is real, and C(t) evolves with oscillation [1].

1. Comparison of perturbation methods

In order to demonstrate advantages of the new
perturbation method, we compare it with traditional
perturbation methods including the ODP, GME, and
TCL methods. The latter two methods involve derivation
of approximate master equations for the damped Jaynes-
Cummings model (see Appendix A). Calculation results
of the evolution of the upper-level population |C|2 by
diﬀerent traditional perturbation methods in the strong-
couping regime are shown in Fig. 1 with details of
calculation presented in Appendix B.

Behaviors of the perturbation methods in the strong-
coupling regime are complicated (see Fig. 1): we
ﬁnd that
the secular ODP terms all diverge and
cannot provide correct approximations;
in spite of
convergence of the results, the TCL method only reﬂects
unidirectional decay behaviors of the system while loses
its oscillatory characteristics; although the GME shows
similar oscillatory behaviors, the oscillating frequency
is mismatched and the population even takes negative
values.
It is also implied that the perturbation results
of any higher order are not in agreement with the
exact solution. Traditional perturbation methods in the
strong-coupling regime therefore all fail.

It is essential to explain why these methods in
the strong-coupling regime are not applicable. The
singularity in Eq. (9) induces a small boundary layer
where C(t) varies so fast when αp → 0 that any order
of ODP solution cannot extend out of the layer and
has to diverge [24]. From TCL master equations only
analytical ΓT(t) can be derived (see Eq. (B2)) which
will never approach the exact Γ(t) in Eq. (5) which in
this case is not only negative but even singular so as to
exhibit its strong non-Markovianity. Finally, in addition
to the disadvantage of losing positivity in Eq. (B1), the
assumption in Eq. (A3) that TrA {ρ(t)} ≈ ρE is time-
independent in GME method is also invalid in the strong-
coupling regime (so is TCL). In fact, the dependence
of ρE(t) on time is strong enough, driven by the Rabi
oscillation between the system and environment.

Next, we apply the multiple-scale integro-diﬀerential
perturbation method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings
model. Since diﬀerent coupling regimes in the model are

simply distinguished by the width-strength ratio λ/γ,
we make an attempt by choosing αp = αq = α2 =
λ/γ, which put in Eq. (9) together with Eq. (11) gives
G0 = 1/2, G1 = −1/2, G2 = 1/4 . . . . Following the
proposed two steps in Section III one can obtain a second-
order partial diﬀerential equation for C (0)( ˜T , ˜τ ) to the

to the non-Markovianity. On the other hand, the partial

monotonic, so is ln C. Hence, the evolution must be non-
Markovian unless the ﬁrst series in Eq. (14) diverges,

In addition, it is worth noting that by expanding the

coincide with {An}. It is very likely that the radius of
convergence of {An} plays as the role of distinguishing
the non-Markovian regime for generic reservoirs, though
the derivation of {An} (and {Bn}) proves to be somewhat
complicated (see Appendix C).

Another noticeable non-Markovian feature related to
time scales is the existence of minimal evolution time [30]
between possible states and steep decrease [30] of the
quantum (open-system) speed limit [31] in the strong-
coupling regime.
It was discovered that the evolution
time between two arbitrarily possible pure/mixed states
is not unique if the evolution is non-Markovian [30]. Here,
clearly it is the existence of the primary time scale that
speeds up the evolution.

and ˆtMS1 = (γλ/2)−1/2(1 − λ/4γ)−1cos−1(cid:112)λ/ (2γ + λ).

In fact, all the singularities correspond to inﬁnite
possibilities of evolution time between two orthogonal
states (with the maximal distance), and ˆtMS0 (ˆtMS1)
is the minimal evolution time deﬁned therein [30].
Compared with the exact solution ˆt = (2/D)[π −
tan−1(D/λ)], relative errors of the minimal evolution
time for two orthogonal states in MS0 and MS1 are
to the order of α and α3, respectively. We note that
the minimal evolution time cannot be identiﬁed by
traditional perturbation methods, either.

(see Appendix C). Figure 2 shows that the ﬁrst-order
perturbation solution (MS1) |C (0) + αC (1)|2 is already

2. Non-Markovianity

It is known that a quantum Markovian evolution de-
ﬁned by a set of trace-reserving linear maps {E(t, t(cid:48)), t ≥
t(cid:48)} where E(t, t(cid:48)) is the propagator for the open system
A deﬁned by Eq. (A4) requires complete positivity for its
propagators under the composition law [6]

E(t, t(cid:48)(cid:48)) = E(t, t(cid:48))E(t(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48)),

t ≥ t(cid:48) ≥ t(cid:48)(cid:48).

Within the form of Eq. (5), the requirement gives rise to
the Gorini-Kossakowski-Susarshan-Lindblad theorem: a
quantum evolution described by Eq. (5) is Markovian if
and only if Γ(t) ≥ 0 for any time t [6]. Furthermore, the
dissipator Γ(t) can be expressed in given time scales,

B. Generic reservoirs

In this subsection, we apply the multiple-scale integro-
diﬀerential method to other generic reservoirs with

similar deﬁnitions of λ and γ like the Lorentzian spectral
density in Eq. (10) and investigate how the results are
related to the speciﬁc form of G(t, t(cid:48)). The perturbation

FIG. 3: (Color online) Generic reservoirs characterized by second-order correlation functions in the form of (a) a
Gaussian error distribution, (b) an inverse-law distribution, and (c) a Gaussian distribution, with their corresponding
approximate solutions of upper-level population from the multiple-scale integro-diﬀerential perturbation method given
in (d), (e), and (f), separately. |C(0)|2 = 1, γ = 1, and λ = 1/10.

solutions should also take neat forms like those of the
damped Jaynes-Cummings model with separated time
scales as variables if we still choose α ∼ (λ/γ)1/2. The
characteristic time for the two primary and auxiliary time
scales Tc and τc are related to the ﬁrst two coeﬃcients of
the series of G(t, t(cid:48)) by Tc ∼ αG
and τc ∼ α2G1,
respectively, which indicates that the global behavior
of C(t) is determined locally at t ∼ t(cid:48) resulted by the
successful analytic expansion of G(t, t(cid:48)) in Eq. (8). One
would expect that the oscillatory and decay behaviors
in the strong-coupling regime are suﬃciently contributed
by the two time scales distinctly like they do in Lorentz
reservoir, but we will see this is not the case.

In Fig. 3, three diﬀerent correlation functions are cho-
sen with corresponding perturbation solutions demon-
strated and compared. The ﬁrst reservoir characterized
by a Gaussian error function results in acceptable
approximation compared with the exact numeric solution
(see Fig. 3(d)). As expected, erfc(x) ∼ o(x−1 exp(−x2))
descends fast enough to make Eq. (8) more ”locally”
dominant.
In comparison to the ﬁrst one, the second
reservoir characterized by an inversed-law correlation
function results in worse approximation (see Fig. 3(e)),
because not only o(x−1) descends much slower which
causes Eq. (8) to be less ”local”, but in fact the non-
integrable inverse-law correlation function leads to log-
singularity of the corresponding spectral density J(ω) at
ω ∼ ω0 as well. It is rather remarkable that the third
reservoir characterized by a Gaussian function results

in completely diﬀerent approximation (see Fig. 3(f))
from the previous two examples. Since this smooth and
symmetric G(t, t(cid:48)) gives rise to G1 = 0, the auxiliary
time scale τ collapses to inﬁnitesimal and becomes trivial.
However, as there is only one attractor at C(∞) = 0
since J(ω) has wings extended to inﬁnity [21], the global
decay still exists and must be contained in the other time
scale(s). The pure oscillating solution of T implies that
our choice of the time scales in Eq. (6) does not apply to
this example and the correct time scales should be more
complicatedly entangled, or even non-linear.

V. BEYOND SIMPLE TWO-LEVEL OPEN

SYSTEM

The multiple-scale integro-diﬀerential perturbation
method can naturally be ﬁtted into any types of gen-
eralized problems as long as non-Markovian evolutions
therein can be written into a set of integro-diﬀerential
equations with memory kernels well deﬁned. We shortly
discuss its possible generalization in this section.

Dipole-dipole interaction.—Duplicated systems under
dipole-dipole interaction are a typical example which
ad lib ﬁts into our method, since the entire Hamiltonians
simply include N individual system Hamiltonians inter-
acting with a shared reservoir in the form of Eq. (1) and

The perturbation procedure is almost exactly the same,
except the order of the dipole-dipole coupling strength
coeﬃcients Kij requires to be initially deﬁned by ˜Kij =
αsKij. Diﬀerent order s identiﬁes diﬀerent dipole-dipole
coupling sub-regimes and inﬂuences non-Markovianity as
well as speed of disentanglements between N systems
directly [32]. One will anticipate that the hardest part of
calculation is to derive N -order determinants which arise
in the orthogonalization of linearly coupled diﬀerential
perturbation equations.

Beyond one photon.—It still remains a problem how to
solve an open system with more than one photon involved
in its reservoir, because the only knowledge J(ω) we
know about the environment is not enough to determine
the entire evolutions. For example, in the two-photon
subspace we consider how the wave function |ψ (t)(cid:105) =

(cid:80)

should evolve. The Schr¨odinger equation gives rise to
(noticing Djk = Dkj)
˙Cj = −i
˙Djk = −ig∗
ke−i(ω0−ωk)tCj,
from which the inﬁnite numbers of formated integro-
diﬀerential equations contain g∗
cross-terms and
cannot be expressed with J(ω). An approach which
can more or less address the problem is to re-discretize
J(ω) into gk (g∗
k) terms and only consider the ﬁrst
ﬁnite Nk modes [21]. Hence, the approximate evolutions
shrink into Nk coupling integro-diﬀerential equations
where our method can thus be tried. We note that the
same discretization procedure can also be generalized
for n-level systems (e.g., the two-band quantum-dot
model [33, 34]).

VI. CONCLUSION

Firstly, we present a new multiple-scale integro-
diﬀerential perturbation method that can be mathe-
matically applied to some kinds of integro-diﬀerential
equations. The particular application of the multiple-
scale method to non-Markovian two-level quantum open

7

systems indicates that there should be two time scales—a
primary time scale T and an auxiliary time scale τ —both
dominating the non-Markovian evolution in the strong-
coupling regime where the system and its environment
are strongly coupled.
It is revealed that none of the
traditional perturbation methods [15, 18–20] works in
the non-Markovian regime. The failures include secular
divergent terms, absence of oscillatory characteristics,
and invalid negative populations. Instead, the multiple-
scale method can provide good approximation for generic
reservoirs, provided the autocorrelation function G(t, t(cid:48))
descends fast enough to be ”local” so that the auxiliary
time scale will not collapse.

Identiﬁcation of negative population/coherence ﬂow in
the master equation in terms of T and τ , in addition,
implies that the existence (convergence) of the primary
time scale should be a signal for non-Markovianity. The
oscillatory and decay behaviors in the strong-coupling
regime are separately contributed by the two time scales
in most cases, yet there exist counterexamples (e.g., the
Gaussian reservoir). Last but not least, singularities of
evolution as well as the minimal evolution time [30] in
the non-Markovian regime can also be identiﬁed by the
multiple-scale integro-diﬀerential perturbation method,
with relative error following the perturbation order. In
the future, we expect our method to be of assistance to
speciﬁc time-related issues in the quantum open system
theory; meanwhile we look forward to expanding the
potential of our work to somewhat general topics, e.g.,
multiple-scaling behaviors, complex networks, etc.

Appendix A: Perturbation Methods on Derivation

of Master Equations

Generalized master equation (GME).−An ordinary
diﬀerential perturbation (ODP) method can only work
for a group of diﬀerential equations given by the
Schr¨odinger equation directly. In practice, it is necessary
to use a density operator in Liouville space instead of
state vectors to quantify statistically mixed quantum
states; the evolution of the density operator for system
A should be trace-reserving under any approximation.
To this end, one introduces the density operator ρ(t) for
A ⊗ E (suppose ρ(t) = |ψ(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ(t)| a pure state w.l.o.g.)
and two Nakajima-Zwanzig projection super-operators P
and Q: Pρ(t) = P nρ(t) = TrE {ρ(t)} ⊗ TrA {ρ(t)} and

Q = 1 − P [18, 19]. It can be proved from the Liouville
equation
