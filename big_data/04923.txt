ON THE NUMBER OF ALTERNATING PATHS IN BIPARTITE

COMPLETE GRAPHS

PATRICK BENNETT, ANDRZEJ DUDEK, ELLIOT LAFORGE

March 17, 2016

Abstract. Let C ⊆ [r]m be a code such that any two words of C have Hamming
distance at least t.
It is not diﬃcult to see that determining a code C with the
maximum number of words is equivalent to ﬁnding the largest n such that there is
an r-edge-coloring of K
m,n with the property that any pair of vertices in the class of
size n has at least t alternating paths (with adjacent edges having diﬀerent colors) of
length 2. In this paper we consider a more general problem from a slightly diﬀerent
direction. We are interested in ﬁnding maximum t such that there is an r-edge-coloring
of K
m,n such that any pair of vertices in class of size n is connected by t internally
disjoint and alternating paths of length 2k. We also study a related problem in which
we drop the assumption that paths are internally disjoint. Finally, we introduce a
new concept, which we call alternating connectivity. Our proofs make use of random
colorings combined with some integer programs.

1. Introduction

In this paper we study alternating paths in bipartite graphs. A path is alternating if
its adjacent edges have diﬀerent colors. The notion of alternating paths was originally
introduced by Bollob´as and Erd˝os [4], where the authors studied under which conditions
an r-edge-colored complete graph contains an alternating Hamiltonian cycle. There
is a broad literature on this subject for graphs, see, e.g., [1, 2, 5, 11], and also for
hypergraphs [6, 7]. Several other results, mainly of algorithmic nature, are also known,
see, e.g., a survey paper [3].

The motivation of this paper comes from coding theory. Recall that the Hamming
distance between vectors x and y in [r]m is deﬁned to be the number of positions in
which they diﬀer, i.e.,

Let αr(m, t) be the maximum size of a code C ⊆ [r]m such that any two elements of C
have Hamming distance at least t. We refer the reader to [9] for more details concerning
coding theory.

dist(x, y) =(cid:12)(cid:12){i : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, x(i) 6= y(i)}(cid:12)(cid:12).

Let Km,n be a complete bipartite graph on vertex set [m] ∪ [n]. Suppose that c :
E(Km,n) → [r] is an r-edge-coloring of Km,n with the property that every pair of
vertices in [n] is connected by at least t alternating paths of length 2 (with 3 vertices).

This edge coloring can be represented as a collection of n vectors of length m with entries
in [r] in the sense that for a vertex v ∈ [n] we deﬁne the vector cv by cv(u) = c({v, u})
for u ∈ [m]. Hence the set of vectors C = {cv : v ∈ [n]} completely encodes the edge
coloring since every edge of Km,n will belong to exactly one of these vectors, and by
looking at the right one we can determine the color assigned to the edge.

Now notice that the number of alternating paths of length 2 between v, w ∈ [n]
is exactly the Hamming distance dist(cv, cw). This is because a path of length 2 is
of the form v − u − w which is alternating if and only if c({v, u}) 6= c({u, w}) or
equivalently cv(u) 6= cw(u). Since c has the property that every pair of vertices in
the same partite set is connected by at least t alternating paths of length 2 it follows
that C has minimum Hamming distance t, thus we must have that |C| = n ≤ αr(m, t).
Consequently, determining αr(m, t) is equivalent to ﬁnding the largest n such that there
is an r-coloring of the edge set of Km,n with the property that any pair of vertices in [n]
has at least t alternating paths of length 2 connecting them. Clearly all such paths are
internally disjoint.

In this paper, we approach the problem from a slightly diﬀerent direction:

instead
of ﬁxing the alphabet, word length, and t and asking for the largest possible code, we
ﬁx the alphabet, word length, and code size and ask for the largest possible t. We also
consider longer paths. Let κr,2k(m, n) be maximum t such that there is an r-coloring
of the edges of Km,n such that any pair of vertices in class of size n is connected by
t internally disjoint and alternating paths of length 2k. As noted above, κr,2(m, n) is
related to coding theory. However we study κr,2k(m, n) for general k. In terms of coding
theory, each such path is an alternating sequence of codewords and indices, such that
each pair of consecutive codewords use diﬀerent letters in the index that connects them
in the sequence. We will show that for r ≥ 2 and n ≥ m ≫ log n

and for any k ≥ 2 and n ≥ m ≫ 1

κr,2(m, n) ∼(cid:18)1 −

1

r(cid:19) m,

κr,2k(m, n) ∼

m
k

.

These results are essentially best possible since for m < logr n we have κr,2(m, n) = 0.
Indeed, if m < logr n, then n > rm and so there must be two vertices in the class of
size n that have the same vectors of colors, and so they have no alternating path of
length 2 connecting them.

We will also consider a related problem in which we drop the requirement that paths
are internally disjoint. Let λℓ(m, n) be the maximum t such that there is a 2-coloring
of the edges of Km,n such that any pair of vertices is connected by t alternating paths
of length ℓ. If ℓ is even, then we consider only pairs in the partition class of size n.
Determining λℓ(m, n) seems to be more diﬃcult. In particular, we will show that

λ3(m, n) ∼ mn/4

and

λ4(m, n) ∼ m2n/8.

In doing so we determine an optimal upper bound on the number of alternating paths

of length 3 and 4 in Km,n under any 2-edge-coloring.

3

Motivated by studying κr,ℓ(m, n), in the last section, we propose a new concept,
which we call alternating connectivity and deﬁne as maximum t such that there is an
r-edge-coloring of G such that any pair of vertices is connected by t internally disjoint
and alternating paths of length ℓ. We will discuss it brieﬂy and show that for complete
graphs

κr,2(Kn) ∼ (1 − 1/r)n

and

κr,ℓ(Kn) ∼ n/(ℓ − 1)

for any r ≥ 2 and ℓ ≥ 3.

Throughout this paper all asymptotics are taken in n. For simplicity, we do not
round numbers that are supposed to be integers either up or down; this is justiﬁed
since these rounding errors are negligible to the asymptomatic calculations we will
make. All logarithms are natural unless written explicitly otherwise.

2. Paths of length 2

In this section we only consider paths of length 2. As it was already mention in the
introduction here instead of ﬁxing the alphabet [r], word length m, and t and asking
for the largest possible code in [r]m with minimum Hamming distance t, we ﬁx the
alphabet, word length, and code size and ask for the largest possible t.

Theorem 2.1. Let r ≥ 2 and n ≥ m ≫ log n. Then,

κr,2(m, n) ∼(cid:18)1 −

1

r(cid:19) m.

This is essentially the best possible since, as it was observed in the introduction, if m <
logr(n), then κr,2(m, n) = 0. The proof of this theorem is an immediate consequence of
Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3.

Lemma 2.2. Let r ≥ 2 and n ≥ m be positive integers. Then,

κr,2(m, n) ≤(cid:18)1 −

r(cid:19)(cid:18)1 +

r(cid:19) m.

(1)

Proof. Let Km,n be an r-edge-colored bipartite graph on [m] ∪ [n]. For a vertex v ∈ [m]
let degi(v) denote the number of edges adjacent to v which are colored by i. Note
that the total number of alternating paths of length 2 with the middle vertex v is

degi(v) degj(v) =

X1≤i<j≤r

P1≤i<j≤r degi(v) degj(v), which is

Lemma 2.3. Let r ≥ 2 and n ≥ m ≫ log n. Then,

κr,2(m, n) ≥(cid:18)1 −

1

r(cid:19) m − o(m).

Proof. Let [m] ∪ [n] be the set of vertices of K = Km,n. To each edge in K we assign
a color from {1, . . . , r} uniformly at random. For u, v ∈ [n], let Xu,v be the random
variable that counts the number of alternating paths between u and v of lengths 2.
Clearly, Xu,v ∼ Bin(m, (r − 1)/r).

We will use the following form of Chernoﬀ’s bound (see, e.g., Theorem 2.1 in [8])

Pr(X ≤ E(X) − t) ≤ exp(cid:18)−

t2

2E(X)(cid:19) ,

where X is a random variable with binomial distribution.

Since E(Xu,v) = (r − 1)m/r and m ≫ log n, we get for t = p5E(Xu,v) log n that

E(X) − t = (r − 1)m/r − o(m) and so

Thus, the union bound taken over all (cid:0)n

the statement.

2(cid:1) ≤ exp(2 log n) pairs of vertices in [n] yields

(cid:3)

3. Paths of arbitrary length

Here we consider κ for paths of any length. Quite surprisingly two colors already

suﬃce to get an optimal result.

Theorem 3.1. Let r ≥ 2, k ≥ 2 and n ≥ m ≫ 1. Then,

κr,2k(m, n) ∼

m
k

.

The only case not covered by the above theorem is when m is a constant. For example,
in this regime is not diﬃcult to see that κ2,4(2, n) = 0 and κ2,4(3, n) = 1 for any n
suﬃciently large.

The proof of Theorem 3.1 is based on the following lemma. Denote by G(m, m, 1/2)
the (truly) random bipartite graph in which every possible edge between two partition
classes of size m is chosen independently with probability 1/2. We say that an event
En occurs with high probability, or w.h.p. for brevity, if limn→∞ Pr(En) = 1.

B ∈(cid:0)M2
Proof. Fix A ∈ (cid:0)M1

Lemma 3.2. Let m ≫ 1 and let 0 < α < 1. Let G(m, m, 1/2) be a random bipartite
graph on set M1 ∪ M2 with |M1| = |M2| = m. Then, w.h.p.

αm(cid:1) there exists a matching between A and B of size αm − o(m).

αm(cid:1) and
αm(cid:1) and let G = G(|A|, |B|, 1/2). First we consider an

for each A ∈ (cid:0)M1

auxiliary bipartite graph H on U ∪ W such that U = A ∪ A′, W = B ∪ B′, H[A ∪ B] =
G, and H[A′ ∪ W ] and H[U ∪ B′] are complete bipartite graphs. Furthermore, let
s = log m = |A′| = |B′|. We show that H has a perfect matching. It suﬃces to show
that the Hall condition holds, i.e.,

αm(cid:1) and B ∈ (cid:0)M2

if S ⊆ U and |S| ≤ |U|/2, then |N(S)| ≥ |S|,

(2)

5

and

if T ⊆ W and |T | ≤ |W |/2, then |N(T )| ≥ |T |.

(3)
If |S| < s, then since N(S) ⊇ B′, |N(S)| ≥ |B′| = s ≥ |S|. Therefore, we assume
that s ≤ |S| ≤ |U|/2. Furthermore, we may assume that S ∩ A′ = ∅. For otherwise,
N(S) = W . We will show that already for |S| = s, |N(S)| ≥ |W |/2 = |U|/2.

Suppose not, that is, |N(S)| < (αm + log m)/2. That means |B ∩ N(S)| < (αm −
log m)/2, e(S, B \ N(S)) = 0 and |B \ N(S)| ≥ (αm + log m)/2 > αm/2. Observe that
the probability that there are sets S ∈ A and T ∈ B such that |S| = s and |T | = αm/2
and e(S, T ) = 0 is at most

s (cid:19)(cid:18) αm
(cid:18)αm

αm/2(cid:19)2−s·αm/2 ≤ 2αm · 2αm · 2−s·αm/2 = 22αm−s·αm/2.

Thus, with probability at most 22αm−s·αm/2 graph H violates (2), and similarly (3). In
other words, with probability at least 1−2·22αm−s·αm/2 graph H has a perfect matching,
and consequently, there is a matching of size αm − s between A and B.

Finally, by taking the union bound over all A ∈(cid:0)M1

probability that there exist A and B such that between A and B there is no matching
of size αm − s is at most

αm(cid:1) we get that the

αm(cid:1) and B ∈(cid:0)M2

αm(cid:19)(cid:18) m
(cid:18) m

αm(cid:19)22αm−s·αm/2+1 ≤ 2m · 2m · 22αm−s·αm/2+1 = o(1),

since s = log m. Also, clearly, we get that αm − s = αm − o(m). Thus, w.h.p. for each
A and B there is a matching between A and B of size αm − o(m).
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 3.1. First observe that the upper bound is trivial since (1 + o(1))m/k
paths of length 2k saturate all vertices in M.

Let M ∪ N be the bipartition of K = Km,n such that |M| = m and |N| = n.
Furthermore, let N = N ′ ∪ N ′′, where |N ′| = m and |N ′′| = n − m. To each edge in
K induced by M ∪ N ′ we assign a color from {blue, red} uniformly at random. To all
other edges (between M and N ′′) we assign colors in such a way that for each v ∈ N ′′,
degB(v) = degR(v) and for each w ∈ M and u, v ∈ N ′′, {u, w} and {v, w} have the
same color (in other words the color vector of each v ∈ N ′′ is the same). Observe that
both the red graph induced on M ∪ N ′ and the blue one can be viewed as G(m, m, 1/2).
So actually our r-edge-coloring uses only 2 colors.

First we consider u and v in N ′′. Let XB(u) and XR(v) be two disjoint subsets of M
such that all edges between u and XB(u) are blue and all edges between v and XR(v)
are red and |XB(u)| = |XR(v)| = m/k. Now we choose subsets X1, . . . , Xk−2 ⊆ M
and Y1, Y2, . . . , Yk−1 ⊆ N ′ which are pairwise disjoint and also disjoint with XB(u) and
XR(v), and |Xi| = |Yj| = m/k. By Lemma 3.2 there is a red matching between XB(u)
and Y1, a blue matching between Y1 and X1, etc., each of size m/k − o(m). This yields
m/k − o(m) alternating and internally disjoint paths between u and v.

Now consider u and v in N ′ and deﬁne

Nxy(u, v) = {w ∈ M : {w, u} has color x and {w, v} has color y}.

Chernoﬀ’s bound implies that |NRR(u, v)| ∼ |NRB(u, v)| ∼ |NBR(u, v)| ∼ |NBB(u, v)| ∼
m/4 for all u, v ∈ N ′. Let XB(u) ⊆ NBR(u, v), XR(v) ⊆ NRR(u, v) such that |XB(u)| =

6

PATRICK BENNETT, ANDRZEJ DUDEK, ELLIOT LAFORGE

|XR(v)| = m/(2k) + o(m). In other words, all edges between u and XB(u) are blue and
all edges between v and XR(v) are red. Now we choose disjoint subsets X1, . . . , Xk−2 ⊆
NBR(u, v) ∪ NRR(u, v) \ (XB(u) ∪ XR(v)) and Y1, . . . , Yk−1 ⊆ N ′ such that |Xi| =
|Yj| = m/(2k) + o(m). By Lemma 3.2 there is a red matching between XB(u) and
Y1, a blue matching between Y1 and X1, etc., each of size m/(2k) − o(m). This yields
m/(2k) − o(m) alternating and internally disjoint paths between u and v. To ﬁnd the
remaining m/(2k) − o(m) paths we choose X ′
B(v) ⊆ NBB(u, v),
X ′
k−1 ⊆ N ′ \ (Y1 ∪
1, . . . , X ′
· · · ∪ Yk−1).

k−2 ⊆ NRB(u, v) ∪ NBB(u, v) \ (X ′

R(u) ⊆ NRB(u, v), X ′

R(u) ∪ X ′

B(v)), and Y ′

1, . . . , Y ′

Finally observe that the case u ∈ N ′ and v ∈ N ′′ is very similar to the latter.

(cid:3)

Note that the above proof would not work for all m ≫ 1 if we used the simpler
strategy of just coloring all edges randomly. In particular, to get the concentration of
degrees we would need m to be at least on the order of log n.

In a similar manner one can deﬁne κr,2k+1(m, n). Now, clearly the endpoints are in
diﬀerent partition classes. This case is not interesting since one can easily see that
κr,2k+1(m, n) ∼ m/k. For the lower bound color by red one matching saturating all
vertices in the class of size m and all other edges blue. As in the previous proof m/k is
best possible.

4. Not necessary internally disjoint paths

In this section we are not assuming anymore that paths must be internally disjoint.
Furthermore, we will only consider 2-colorings. Recall that λℓ(m, n) denotes the max-
imum t such that there is a 2-edge-coloring of Km,n such that any pair of vertices is
connected by t alternating paths of length ℓ. If ℓ is even, then we consider only pairs
in partition class of size n.

In general determining λ seems to be more diﬃcult than κ and as we will see the

corresponding results for λ signiﬁcantly diﬀer from those for κ.

We start with a lower bound.

Theorem 4.1. Let k ≥ 1 be an integer.

(i) If n ≥ m ≫ log n, then

λ2k(m, n) ≥ (1 + o(1))mknk−1/22k−1.

(ii) If n ≥ m = Ω(1), then

λ2k+1(m, n) ≥ (1 + o(1))(mn/4)k.

(4)

(5)

Proof. For (ii) it suﬃces to consider the following coloring. Let M = M1 ∪ M2 and
N = N1 ∪ N2, |Mi| = m/2 and |Ni| = n/2, be partition classes of Km,n. Color the edges
between Mi and Ni red and blue otherwise. It is easy to see that this coloring yields
λ2k+1(m, n) ≥ (1 + o(1))(m/2)k(n/2)k.

Now we show (i). We use the concentration of degrees and codegrees. We ﬁx vertices
u and v in N. We then choose some x1 ∈ M such that {u, x1} is red, some x2 ∈ N such
that {x1, x2} is blue, and so on until we reach x2k−2 ∈ N. So far there are asymptotically
m
2 choices for each xi if i is odd, and n
2 choices if i is even. Now we have to choose x2k−1
such that the edge {x2k−2, x2k−1} is red and {x2k−1, v} is blue. There are asymptotically

m

4 choices for x2k−1. This gives mknk−1/22k choices for paths with a red edge adjacent
to u. Similarly, we estimate the number of paths with a blue edge adjacent to u.
(cid:3)

It is not clear whether Theorem 4.1 is optimal in general. Here we managed to show
tight upper bounds on λ3(m, n) and λ4(m, n). Clearly also λ2(m, n) = κ2,2(m, n) ∼
m/2.

7

Theorem 4.2. Let n ≥ m ≥ 1. Then,

λ3(m, n) ≤ mn/4

and

λ4(m, n) ≤ (1 + o(1))m2n/8.

This theorem will immediately follow from the following result.

Lemma 4.3. Let the edges of Km,n be 2-colored. Then, the number of all alternating
paths of length 3 is at most m2n2/4 and the number of all alternating paths of length 4
with two endpoints in the class of size n is at most m2n3/16.

Indeed, this lemma implies that

and

λ3(m, n) ≤ (m2n2/4)(cid:14)mn = mn/4,

λ4(m, n) ≤ (m2n3/16)(cid:14)(cid:18)n

2(cid:19) = (1 + o(1))m2n/8.

Proof of Lemma 4.3. Let K = Km,n be a blue-red edge-colored bipartite graph on [m]∪
[n].

First we count the total number of alternating paths of length 3. Each such path has
two vertices u, v ∈ [m] and two vertices x1, x2 ∈ [n]. We assume that u and v are ﬁxed
and u < v. First we determine the number of red-blue-red paths containing u and v.
Here we have two possibilities: either u − x1 − v − x2 is red-blue-red or x1 − u − x2 − v
is red-blue-red. This yields

codegRB(u, v) degR(v) + degR(u)codegBR(u, v)

number of choices, where codegxy(u, v) = |Nxy(u, v)|. Similarly, we see that the number
of blue-red-blue paths containing u and v is

codegBR(u, v) degB(v) + degB(u)codegRB(u, v).

Thus, the number of alternating path of length 3 is never bigger than the solution of
the following integer program:

Maximize

subject to: The solution is graphical.

P1≤u<v≤m xBR(u, v)[xR(u) + xB(v)] + xRB(u, v)[xB(u) + xR(v)]

We say that a solution is graphical if there exists a 2-edge-coloring of Km,n which realizes
all color degrees and codegrees corresponding to the variables of the program.

We will ﬁnd an upper bound on the solution of this program. First we show that

xBR(u, v) − xRB(u, v) = xB(u) − xB(v).

(6)

8

PATRICK BENNETT, ANDRZEJ DUDEK, ELLIOT LAFORGE

Let XB(u) and XB(v) be the set of vertices that are connected to u and v by blue edges,
respectively. Furthermore, let XBR(u, v) be the set of vertices w such that {u, w} is blue
and {v, w} is red. Similarly, we deﬁne XRB(u, v). Now since the solution is graphical

XBR(u, v) = XB(u) \ (XB(u) ∩ XB(v)) and XRB(u, v) = XB(v) \ (XB(u) ∩ XB(v)),

we get

xBR(u, v) − xRB(u, v) = |XBR(u, v)| − |XRB(u, v)|

= |XB(u) \ (XB(u) ∩ XB(v))| − |XB(v) \ (XB(u) ∩ XB(v))|
= (|XB(u)| − |(XB(u) ∩ XB(v))|) − (|XB(v)| − |(XB(u) ∩ XB(v))|)
= |XB(u)| − |XB(v)| = xB(u) − xB(v)

proving (6).

Set c(u, v) = xRB(u, v) + xBR(u, v). Due to (6)

xBR(u, v) =

c(u, v) + xB(u) − xB(v)

2

xRB(u, v) =

c(u, v) − xB(u) + xB(v)

2

.

(7)

(8)

xR(u) = n − xB(u)

and

xR(v) = n − xB(v),

and

Furthermore, since

we get

xBR(u, v)[xR(u) + xB(v)] + xRB(u, v)[xB(u) + xR(v)]

=

c(u, v) + [xB(u) − xB(v)]

2

(n − [xB(u) − xB(v)])

+

c(u, v) − [xB(u) − xB(v)]

2

(n + [xB(u) − xB(v)])

= c(u, v)n − [xB(u) − xB(v)]2 ≤ c(u, v)n.

Thus,

X1≤u<v≤m

xBR(u, v)[xR(u) + xB(v)] + xRB(u, v)[xB(u) + xR(v)]

≤ n X1≤u<v≤m

c(u, v).

(9)

Note that for any 2-coloring of the edges of K

X1≤u<v≤m
codegRB(u, v) + codegBR(u, v) = Xw∈N
degR(w) degB(w) ≤ Xw∈[n](cid:18) degR(w) + degB(w)

2

and since

Xw∈[n]

degR(w) degB(w),

(cid:19)2

= n ·(cid:16) m
2(cid:17)2

,

9

we obtain

X1≤u<v≤m

c(u, v) = X1≤u<v≤m

xRB(u, v) + xBR(u, v) ≤ m2n/4.

(10)

Thus, (9) and (10) imply that λ3(m, n) ≤ m2n2/4.

Now we count the total number of alternating paths of length 4 with both endpoints
in N. Each such path is of the form x1 − u − x2 − v − x3, where u, v ∈ [m] and
x1, x2, x3 ∈ [n]. Similarly as in the previous case we ﬁx u, v ∈ [m] with u < v and count
the number of paths going through u, v. Thus, the number of red-blue-red-blue paths
is at most

Thus, the number of alternating path of length 4 is bounded from above by the solution
of the following integer program:

As before we set c(u, v) = xRB(u, v) + xBR(u, v) and by (7) and (8) we get

xR(u)xBR(u, v)xB(v) + xB(u)xRB(u, v)xR(v) =
c(u, v) + xB(u) − xB(v)

The last equality follows just from simple algebra operations. Since c(u, v) ≤ n, the
second term is at most 0. Furthermore, clearly

xB(u)[n − xB(u)] ≤ n2/4

and

xB(v)[n − xB(v)] ≤ n2/4.

Thus,

xR(u)xBR(u, v)xB(v) + xB(u)xRB(u, v)xR(v) ≤ c(u, v)n2/4.

ﬁnishing the proof for path of length 4.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3 establishes the maximum number of alternating path of length 3 and 4.
It is not diﬃcult to see that in theory the approach taken in the proof of this lemma can
be extended to counting alternating paths of any length. For example, binding from
above the number of paths of length 5 corresponds to the following integer program.

Maximize

X1≤u<w<v≤m

f (u, v, w)

subject to: The solution is graphical

where

f (u, w, v) = xBR(u, w)xBR(w, v)[xR(u) + xB(v)]

+ xRB(u, w)xBR(u, v)[xR(w) + xB(v)]

+ xBR(u, w)xRB(u, v)[xB(w) + xR(v)]

+ xBR(u, v)xRB(w, v)[xR(u) + xB(w)]

+ xRB(u, v)xBR(w, v)[xB(u) + xR(w)].

Unfortunately, the objective function is more complicated and computations become
more diﬃcult and technical.

One can also show that the problem of counting alternating paths in K = Km,n can
be reduced to ﬁnding directed paths in a certain digraph. Indeed, let a 2-coloring of
edges of K be given. Furthermore, assume that M ∪N is the corresponding bipartition.
We build a bipartite digraph D on M ∪ N as follows. For each red edge {u, v} with
u ∈ N and v ∈ M we deﬁne a directed edge uv in D; otherwise, if {u, v} is blue, then we
add to D directed edge vu. In other words, all red edges are oriented from N to M and
blue ones from M to N. Clearly, each alternating path in K corresponds to a (unique)
directed path in D. Hence, we just reduced the problem of counting alternating paths
in K to counting directed paths in bipartite tournament. Unfortunately, in general the
problem of counting directed paths does not seem to be easy (see, e.g., [10]).

Finally let us mention that one can also study λ for any number r of colors, denoted
by λr,ℓ(m, n). Since λr,2(m, n) = κr,2(m, n), Theorem 2.1 implies that λr,2(m, n) ∼
(1 − 1/r)m provided that n ≥ m ≫ log n. By assigning to the edges of Km,n colors
from set [r] uniformly at random one can see (like in the proof of Theorem 4.1) that
λr,2k(m, n) ≥ (1 + o(1))mknk−1(1 − 1/r)2k−1 and λ2k+1(m, n) ≥ (1 + o(1))(mn)k(1 −
1/r)2k. The optimality of these bounds remains open.

5. Remarks on alternating connectivity

Motivated by studying internally disjoint and alternating paths in a complete bipar-
tite graph we introduce alternating connectivity. Let κr,ℓ(G) be alternating connectivity
of a graph G deﬁned as maximum t such that there is an r-edge-coloring of G such that
any pair of vertices is connected by t internally disjoint and alternating paths of length ℓ.

As in Sections 2 and 3 we show that for complete graphs the following holds.

Theorem 5.1. Let n ≫ 1. Then, for any number of colors r ≥ 2

and for ℓ ≥ 3

κr,2(Kn) ∼ (1 − 1/r)n,

κr,ℓ(Kn) ∼ n/(ℓ − 1).

(11)

(12)

Proof. For (11) observe that like in the proof of Lemma 2.2 the total number of alter-
nating paths of length 2 in Kn is at most (due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality)

On the other hand, assigning colors from {1, . . . , r} uniformly at random to the edges
of Kn (as in the proof of Lemma 2.3) yields κr,2(Kn) ≥ (1 − 1/r)n − o(n), provided that
n ≫ 1. This ﬁnishes the proof of (11).

For (12) we slightly modify proofs from Section 3. Clearly, the upper bound is trivial,
since any collection of n/(ℓ − 1) internally disjoint paths of length ℓ must saturate all
vertices. For the lower bound we will show that there exists a 2-coloring of the edges
with the required property. First observe that one can easily generalize Lemma 3.2
for a (truly) random graph G(n, 1/2), where each edge is chosen independently with
probability 1/2.

Lemma 5.2. Let n ≫ 1 and 0 < α < 1/2. Let G(n, 1/2) be a random graph on set of

vertices [n]. Then, w.h.p. for each A ∈(cid:0)[n]

a matching between A and B of size αn − o(n).

αn(cid:1) and B ∈(cid:0)[n]

αn(cid:1) with A ∩ B = ∅ there exists

Now we are ready to ﬁnish the proof of (12). Assign colors from {blue, red} uniformly
at random to the edges of Kn. Let u, v ∈ V (Kn). By Chernoﬀ’s bound, |NRR(u, v)| ∼
|NRB(u, v)| ∼ |NBR(u, v)| ∼ |NBB(u, v)| ∼ n/4.

Now if ℓ is even, then we proceed like in the proof of Theorem 3.1. Let XB(u) ⊆
NBR(u, v), XR(v) ⊆ NRR(u, v) such that |XB(u)| = |XR(v)| = n/(2(ℓ − 1)) − o(n).
In other words, all edges between u and XB(u) are blue and all edges between v and
XR(v) are red. Now we choose disjoint subsets X1, . . . , Xℓ−3 ⊆ NBR(u, v) ∪ NRR(u, v) \

12

(XB(u) ∪ XR(v)) such that |Xi| = n/(2(ℓ − 1)) + o(n). By Lemma 5.2 there is a red
matching between XB(u) and X1, a blue matching between X1 and X2, etc., each of size
n/(2(ℓ − 1)) − o(n). This yields n/(2(ℓ − 1)) − o(n) alternating and internally disjoint
paths between u and v. To ﬁnd the remaining n/(2(ℓ − 1)) − o(n) paths we choose
X ′
k−2 ⊆ NRB(u, v) ∪ NBB(u, v) \
(X ′

R(u) ⊆ NRB(u, v), X ′
R(u) ∪ X ′
Finally, if ℓ is odd, then we choose XB(u) ⊆ NBR(u, v), XB(v) ⊆ NBB(u, v), and
X1, . . . , Xℓ−3 ⊆ NBR(u, v) ∪ NBB(u, v) \ (XB(u) ∪ XB(v)), and for the remaining paths
X ′
ℓ−3 ⊆ NRB(u, v) ∪ NRR(u, v) \

R(v)).

R(v) ⊆ NRR(u, v), and X ′

R(u) ⊆ NRB(u, v), X ′

It might be of some interest to investigate κr,ℓ(G) for an arbitrarily graph G. For
example, studying alternating connectivity of random graphs could lead to better un-
derstanding of this concept.
