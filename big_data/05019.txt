We introduce the concept of 3D reducible metamaterials whose constituent permittivity can be
modelled by a factorized proﬁle. The separated cartesian coordinates dependence, easily achieved
in all-optical reconﬁgurable materials, allows to physically regard a reducible metamaterial as a
superposition of three ﬁctitious 1D generating media. We prove that, in the long-wavelength limit,
the electromagnetic response of reducible metamaterials can be reconstructed from the properties
of the 1D generating media whose interplay provides large freedom to control the electromagnetic
chirality. Our approach introduces an unprecedented decomposition strategy in metamaterial science
which allows the full ab-initio and ﬂexible design of a complex 3D bianisotropic response by using
1D metamaterials as basic building blocks.

spectral analysis).

One of the most powerful strategy of analysis in science
consists in decomposing a complex object as a collection
of simpler sub-objects whose properties are well-known
(e.g.
In metamaterial science, the
basic and simplest systems are 1D metamaterials which
are stratiﬁed media rapidly varying along the stratiﬁed
direction and whose homogenized bianisotropic response
admits fully analytical description [1]. In spite of the sim-
plicity of such 1D systems, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no strategy in literature where the analysis of a
complex 3D metamaterial and its bianisotropic response
is based on a decomposition where 1D media play the
role of basic building blocks.

Electromagnetic propagation through metamaterials is
usually described by means of eﬀective medium theories
[2–5] which are adequate when the radiation wavelength
is much larger than the structure periodicity. Basically
such homogenization approaches provide a method for
evaluating the eﬀective permittivity and permeability of
the homogeneous eﬀective medium from the knowledge
of the electromagnetic properties of the metamaterial in-
clusions and their spatial arrangement. More reﬁned
approaches [1, 6–8], encompassing the bianisotropic re-
sponse of the inclusions and/or the spatial dispersion of
the overall structure, allow to evaluate the bianisotropic
eﬀective parameters of the eﬀective medium. Apart from
the 1D situation of stratiﬁed media, such schemes are
rather involved so that an ab-initio and fully analyti-
cal description of the nonlocal eﬀective medium is not
generally available. Evidently, such a lack of analytical
expressions for the eﬀective parameters hampers the ﬁne
tailoring of the metamaterial inclusions to achieve a de-
sired eﬀect.

Chiral metamaterials, whose structure cannot be su-
perimposed onto their mirror images, have attracted
much research eﬀort in the last decade [9, 10] since they
host remarkable electromagnetic eﬀects which are much
more pronounced then in natural chiral media or can-
not be observed in nature at all. Relevant examples of
such phenomena are negative refraction [11–15], giant op-
tical activity [16–18], asymmetric transmission [19, 20]
and switching of the chiral metamaterial response [21–

23]. Since chiral asymmetry is a 3D geometrical property,
chiral metamaterials are composed of complex-shaped 3D
metallic inclusions, e.g. twisted crosses or twisted split-
ring resonators. Metamaterials exhibiting 2D and 1D ge-
ometric chirality, i.e. that cannot be superimposed onto
their mirror images using only rigid motions of a plane
(translations and in-plane rotation) and of a line (trans-
lations), have also been considered. Such 2D and 1D
chiral metamaterials are generally composed by planar
metallic building blocks and therefore their manufactur-
ing and electromagnetic analysis is considerably simpler
than chiral metamaterials. Strong optical activity and
circular dichroism have been predicted and observed in
planar chiral metamaterials [24–29] and extrinsically chi-
ral metamaterials [30–37] which are characterized by 2D
and 1D geometric chirality, respectively. Another class of
metamaterials displaying 1D geometric chirality, which
is probably the simplest, is that of 1D metamaterials [1]
which have recently been shown to exhibit highly tun-
ability if containing graphene sheets [38] and to support
strong optical activity in the epsilon-near-zero regime
[39].

In this paper we introduce the class of 3D reducible
metamaterials, artiﬁcial media which can be decomposed
in terms of three ﬁctitious 1D generating media. The
decomposition is entailed by the factorization of the
constituent permittivity proﬁle as the product of three
functions each depending on a single cartesian coordi-
nate. The factorized permittivity proﬁle can be obtained
through a number of gray-scale permittivity design tech-
niques, as all-photodesigning both in semiconductors [40]
and in phase change materials [41] and digitalization [42].
We show that a remarkable consequence of the decom-
position is the possibility to reconstruct the eﬀective re-
sponse (in the long-wavelength limit) from those of the
1D generating media. Therefore the description of the
eﬀective bianisotropic response, for reducible metamate-
rials, is ab-intio and fully analytical, and this allows the
complete and simultaneous design of both dielectric and
chiral properties.

Let us consider an unbounded metamaterial whose un-
derlying nonmagnetic inclusions are spatially patterned,

for simplicity, on a simple cubic lattice whose period L
is much smaller than the radiation wavelength λ, so that
η = L/λ ≪ 1.
In this paper we consider the class of
reducible chiral metamaterials (RCMMs) whose relative
dielectric permittivity εR(r) (the subscripts will hereafter
be used for constituent quantities) has the same period-
icity of the metamaterial and it is separable, i.e.
it can
be written as

εR(r) = εx(x)εy(y)εz(z),

(1)

where εα(xα) (α = 1, 2, 3) are three one-dimensional pe-
riodic functions with period L.
In order to obtain the
electromagnetic response of RCMMs in the long wave-
length limit η ≪ 1, we exploit the nonlocal homogeniza-
tion approach theory developed in Ref.[1]. According to
such approach, a metamaterial with periodic dielectric
constant ǫM (r) is described, up to the ﬁrst order of η, by
the eﬀective medium constituent relations

Here ε(M) and κ(M) are the eﬀective permittivity and
chiral tensors (the superscripts will hereafter be used for
eﬀective quantities), respectively, and they are given by

where k0 = 2π/λ, ǫαβγ is the Levi-Civita symbol, the
overline over a function W stands for its spatial average
over the cubic unit cell C, i.e. W = 1
fα(r) are the three functions having the metamaterial
periodicity with vanishing spatial average (fα = 0) which
satisfy the equations

L3 RC d3rW (r), and

∇ · (εM ∇fα) = −∂αεM .

(4)

For a general dielectric proﬁle, these equations can not
be analytically solved and one has to resort either to
numerical or to spectral methods [1, 4]. On the other
hand, the situation of RCMMs is peculiar since, for the
dielectric proﬁle of Eq.(1) (i.e.
for ǫM = ǫR), Eq.(4)
yields

d

dxα(cid:19) = −

(5)

in which the dependence fα(r) = fα(xα) has been self-
consistently assumed and which is satisﬁed by only one
function fα(xα) which is periodic with period L and has
vanishing spatial average.

It is now crucial noting that, for a periodic 1D medium
whose dielectric permittivity is εM (r) = εα(xα), Eq.(4)

2

reproduces Eq.(5) [1]. In other words the functions fx(x),
fy(y) and fz(z) of a 3D RCMM coincide with those per-
taining three 1D media whose permittivities are εx(x),
εy(y) and εz(z). Therefore, it is natural to decompose a
RCMM into three ﬁctitious 1D generating media (GM)
whose permittivities are the xα-dependent parts of the
separable permittivity proﬁle of Eq.(1). The eﬀective
permittivity and chiral tensors, ε(α) and κ(α), of the three
GM are [1]

gree of electromagnetic chirality of the GM associated
to the xα direction since it vanishes if the permittivity
proﬁle ǫα(xα) can not be superposed onto its mirror im-
age by using translations without resorting rotations (1D
chirality) [1, 39].

The above discussed decomposition of a RCMM has
remarkable consequences on its eﬀective electromagnetic
response. From Ref.[1], the functions fα(xα) satisfy-
ing Eq.(5) are fα(xα) = L

expressions which are the main result of the present pa-
per. From Eqs.(10) it turns out that RCMMs are gen-
erally biaxial media with pseudo-chiral-omega chirality
(Tr κ(R) = 0). It is worth stressing that the homogeniza-
tion procedure we have discussed to obtain these tensors
from the constituent permittivity proﬁle εR(r) is fully an-
alytical (i.e. it only requires the evaluation of the Fourier
coeﬃcients aα,n and bα,n and the summation of the series
for τα). To the best of our knowledge, RCMMs are the
only situation where a complex three-dimensional struc-
ture admits fully analytical ab-initio description of its
eﬀective bianisotropy. Moreover, Eqs.(10) have a deeper
conceptual value since, using Eqs.(6), they can be rewrit-
ten as

ε(R) = ε(x)ε(y)ε(z),
κ(R) = κ(x)ε(y)ε(z) + κ(y)ε(x)ε(z) + κ(z)ε(x)ε(y). (8)

In other words RCMMs have eﬀective permittivity and
chiral tensors which are combinations of the correspond-
ing GM tensors, i.e. their bianisotropy is reconstructed

from those of the GM. The whole analysis hitherto con-
sidered in summarized in Fig.1 where it is pictorially
sketched that homogenization of a RCMM can be bro-
ken into three steps: 1) decomposition into GM; 2) ho-
mogenization of the GM; 3) reconstruction of the RCMM
eﬀective bianisotropy from those of the GM.

In order to test the above results we have compared
the plane-waves isofrequency surfaces and polarizations
of the bianisotropic eﬀective medium with those pre-
dicted by the full-wave photonic crystal description. For
simplicity, we have focused on 2D RCMMs whose con-
stituent permittivity is εR(x, y) = ǫx(x)ǫy(y) (i.e. with
ǫz(z) = 1) where

ǫα(xα) = Aα + Bα(cid:20)cos(cid:18) 2π

L

xa(cid:19) + sin(cid:18) 4π

L

(9)

In Eq.(9), Aα = ǫα(xα) whereas Bα is a parameter
accounting for the 1D chirality of the proﬁle ǫα(xα)
since, for Bα 6= 0, there is no translation T for which
ǫα(T − xα) = ǫα(xα). Maxwell equations for the ef-
fective medium of Eq.(2),
for the plane waves E =
Vei(kxx+kyy+kzz), turn into the homogeneous system

0ε(R)(cid:3) V = 0 where

(cid:2)K 2 + ik0(cid:0)Kκ(R) + κ(R)T K(cid:1) + k2

(K)αβ = ǫαβγkγ, and ε(R) and κ(R) are the eﬀective
tensors of Eq.(8) evaluated from the permittivity pro-
ﬁle εR(x, y) through the above described procedure. Ac-
cordingly the eigenvalues kz (kx, ky) and polarizations
V (kx, ky) are evaluated after imposing the compatibil-
ity of the system (i.e. after setting the determinant of
the coeﬃcient matrix equal to zero). On the other hand,
in the full-wave photonic crystal description, the peri-
odic permittity εR(x, y) supports, for each (kx, ky) in the
ﬁrst Brillouin zone |kx| < π/L, |ky| < π/L, the Bloch

modes E = UB(x, y; kB

As a numerical example we consider the bi-dimensional
RCMM with Ax = 1 + 0.2i, Bx = 2, Ay = 3 and
By = 1.4, for the period to wavelength ratio η = 0.07,
and in Fig.2(a) we plot the real and imaginary parts of its
permittivity proﬁle εR on the unit cell. For each (kx, ky),
there are four eigenvalues kzn(kx, ky) in the eﬀective
medium description and a inﬁnite number of eigenval-
ues kB
In Fig.2(b)
we plot the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues
kz1, kz2 (surfaces) and kB
z2 (dots), normalized with
kL = 2π/L, where kz1 and kz2 are the eﬀective medium
eigenvalues with positive real parts whereas kB
z2 are
the correspondingly closest Bloch eigenvalues. For each
mode reported in Fig.2(b) we have evaluated the normal-
ized polarizations v = V/|V| and vB = VB/|VB| and
we have plotted the absolute values of their components
in Fig.2(c). The very good agreement between the two
approaches proves the accuracy of the eﬀective medium
description of RCMMs. Note, from the second row of
Fig.2(c), that the modes 2 have the polarization proﬁles
which are not symmetric for the reﬂection kx → −kx and
this is a clearly due to electromagnetic chirality which
here plays a signiﬁcant role.

An interesting feature of RCMMs is that their bi-
anisotropic response is produced by the full interplay of
the three independent GM, since each of them aﬀects all
the components of the tensors of Eqs.(10). Such remark-
able property, once combined with the potential antires-
onant aα,0 ≃ 0 (Epsilon-Near-Zero regime [39]) and reso-
nant bα,0 ≃ 0 behaviors of the GM, can be used to achieve
enhancement and/or suppression of speciﬁc mechanisms.
As an example we discuss the possibility of enhancing
the medium electromagnetic chirality. Note that for a
single 1D stratiﬁed medium, the condition bα,0 ≃ 0 does
not generally lead to the full enhancement of its electro-
magnetic chirality since b−1
α,0 appears in both tensors of
Eqs.(6). On the other hand, the interplay of the three
GM can be used to compensate the resonance of one GM

mittivities and, at the same time, to achieve large chiral-
ity tensors components. As an example, suppose that

and the quantities labelled by capital letters are of the
order of 1. In this example the x- and z-associated GM

so that, due to the factor 1/ξ ≫ 1, the components of the

chirality tensor can become large while the permittivity
do not experience enhancement.

In conclusion, we have considered the novel class of
RCMMs whose permittivity separability has deep conse-
quences on the electromagnetic response of the medium
in the long-wavelength limit. Speciﬁcally we have shown
that three GM can be associated to a RCMM and that
the bianisotropic response of the latter can be obtained
by combining those of the 1D media. Both the permittiv-
ity and chiral tensor of a RCMM have components factor-
ized as products of three contributions coming from the
three 1D media. This provides the unique possibility of
exploiting the interplay between the three GM to achieve,
with desired suppressions and enhancements, the desired
bianisotropic response.
