Within the scope of Bianchi type-III spacetime we study the role of spinor ﬁeld on the
evolution of the Universe as well as the inﬂuence of gravity on the spinor ﬁeld. In doing so
we have considered a polynomial type of nonlinearity. In this case the spacetime remains
locally rotationally symmetric and anisotropic all the time. It is found that depending on the
sign of nonlinearity the models allows both accelerated and oscillatory modes of expansion.
The non-diagonal components of energy-momentum tensor though impose some restrictions
on metric functions and components of spinor ﬁeld, unlike Bianchi type I, V and V I0 cases,
they do not lead to vanishing mass and nonlinear terms of the spinor ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

Discovery and further reconﬁrmation of the existence of the late time accelerated mode of
expansion [1, 2] have given rise to a number of alternative studies of the evolution of the Universe.
Though the models with L
-term [3–5], quintessence [6–11], Chaplygin gas [12–19] etc. retain
their position as the prime candidates to explain this phenomenon, nevertheless some other mod-
els of dark energy are also proposed. After some remarkable works by different authors [20–34],
showing the important role of spinor ﬁeld in the evolution of the Universe, it has been exten-
sively used to model the dark energy. This success is directly related to its ability to answer some
fundamental questions of modern cosmology: (i) Problem of initial singularity and its possible
elimination [22–24, 26, 27, 35–38]; (ii) problem of isotropization [24, 26, 29, 36, 39] and (iii) late
time acceleration of the Universe [28, 30–32, 35–38, 40, 41]. Moreover recently it was found that
the spinor ﬁeld can also describe the different characteristics of matter from ekpyrotic matter to
phantom matter, as well as Chaplygin gas [42–46].

In some recent studies [47–49] it was shown that due to its speciﬁc behavior in curve spacetime
the spinor ﬁeld can signiﬁcantly change not only the geometry of spacetime but itself as well. The
existence of nontrivial non-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor plays a vital
role in this matter. In [47, 48] it was shown that depending on the type restriction imposed on the
non-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor, the initially Bianchi type-I evolve into
a LRS Bianchi type-I spacetime or FRW one from the very beginning, whereas the model may
describe a general Bianchi type-I spacetime but in that case the spinor ﬁeld becomes massless and
linear. The same thing happens for a Bianchi type-V I0 spacetime, i.e., the geometry of Bianchi
type-V I0 spacetime does not allow the existence of a massive and nonlinear spinor ﬁeld in some
particular cases [49]. In this paper we study the role of spinor ﬁeld on the evolution of a Bianchi
type-III spacetime.

The purpose of considering the anisotropic cosmological models lies on the fact that recent
observational data from Cosmic Background Explorer’s differential Radiometer have detected and
measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies in different angular scale. We consider here
Bianchi type III model due to some special interest of cosmologist towards it due to its peculiar
geometric interpretation [50]. Yadav et al. [51], Pradhan et al. [52, 53] have recently studied
homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-III spacetime in context of massive strings. Recently
Yadav [54] has obtained Bianchi type-III anisotropic DE models with constant deceleration pa-
rameter. In this paper, they have investigated a new anisotropic Bianchi type-III DE model with
variable w without assuming constant deceleration parameter. A spinor description of dark energy
within the scope of a BIII model was given in [55]. Further the accelerating dark energy models
of the Universe within the scope of Bianchi type-III spacetime were studied in [56–58]. Bianchi
type III cosmological models with varying L

term was studied in [59].

II. BASIC EQUATION

Let us consider the case when the anisotropic spacetime is ﬁlled with nonlinear spinor ﬁeld.

The corresponding action can be given by

with

S (g;y , ¯y ) =Z L√−gdW

L = Lg + Lsp.

(2.1)

(2.2)

Here Lg corresponds to the gravitational ﬁeld

(2.3)
where R is the scalar curvature, k = 8p G, with G being Newton’s gravitational constant and Lsp is
the spinor ﬁeld Lagrangian.

Lg =

B. Spinor ﬁeld

For a spinor ﬁeld y

, the symmetry between y and ¯y appears to demand that one should choose
the symmetrized Lagrangian [60]. Keeping this in mind we choose the spinor ﬁeld Lagrangian as
[24]:

Lsp =

2(cid:20) ¯yg

m

m y − (cid:209)

m ¯yg

m y (cid:21)− msp ¯yy − F,

(2.7)

where the nonlinear term F describes the self-interaction of a spinor ﬁeld and can be presented as
some arbitrary functions of invariants generated from the real bilinear forms of a spinor ﬁeld. Here
we consider F = F(K) with K being one of the following expressions:{I, J, I + J, I − J}, where
I = S2 = ( ¯yy
. It can be shown that thanks to Fierz identity this type
of nonlinear term describes the nonlinearity in its most general form. In (2.7) (cid:209)
is the covariant

As it was found in previous papers, due to explicit presence of a3 in the Einstein equations, one
needs some additional conditions. In an early work we propose two different situation, namely,
set a3 = √V and a3 = V which allows us to obtain exact solutions for the metric functions.
ing that the expansion is proportion to a component of the shear tensor, namely

In a recent paper we imposed the proportionality condition, widely used in literature. Demand-

SahaB.

The motivation behind assuming this condition is explained with reference to Thorne [61], the
observations of the velocity-red-shift relation for extragalactic sources suggest that Hubble ex-
pansion of the universe is isotropic today within ≈ 30 per cent [62, 63]. To put more precisely,
red-shift studies place the limit
(2.31)

on the ratio of shear s
to Hubble constant H in the neighborhood of our Galaxy today. Collins
et al. [64] have pointed out that for spatially homogeneous metric, the normal congruence to the
homogeneous expansion satisﬁes that the condition s
is constant. Under this proportionality con-
q
dition it was also found that the energy-momentum distribution of the model is strictly isotropic,
which is absolutely true for our case.

In order to exploit the proportionality condition (2.30) Let us now ﬁnd expansion and shear for

In order to solve (2.42) we have to know the relation between the spinor and the gravitational
ﬁelds. Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd those relations for different K.

In case of K = I, i.e. G = 0 from (2.21a) we duly have

˙S0 = 0,

As far as case with K = {J, I + J, I − J} that gives KJ = ±1 is concerned, it can be solved
In case of K = J, i.e. F = D = 0 from (2.21b) we duly have

Finally, for K = I − J the equations (2.21a) and (2.21b) can be rewritten as

III. SOLUTION TO THE FIELD EQUATIONS

view of (2.8) and (2.14) the spinor ﬁeld equation (2.16a) takes the form

and f (t1) is the solution at t = t1. As we have already shown, K = V 2
0 /V 2 for K = {J, I + J, I − J}
0 /V 2 for K = I for any spinor-mass. Since our Universe is
with trivial spinor-mass and K = V 2
expanding, the quantities D, Y and G become trivial at large t. Hence in case of K = I with non-
trivial spinor-mass one can assume f (t1) = col (e−ımspt1, e−ımspt1, eımspt1, eımspt1), whereas for other
i being some constants.
Here we have used the fact that F = msp + D. The other way to solve the system (3.3) is given in
[27].
As far as equation for V , i.e., (2.42) is concerned, we solve it setting K = I as in this case we

To determine the type of nonlinearity that can be dominant both at the early stage as well as late
time of evolution let us go back to (3.10). As one sees, for the nonlinearity to be dominant at early
stage when V → 0 one should have nk = n1: n1 > 1/2 and n1 > 1/3 +1/N3. For nk = n0: n0 = 1/2
this term can be added to the mass term. And ﬁnally for the nonlinear term to prevail at late time
when V → ¥ one should choose nk = n2: n2 < 1/2 and n2 < 1/3 + 1/N3. Then we can rewrite the

equation for V with the nonlinear term that determines both the early stage and the later stage of
equation as follows

where we denote ¯X1 = 3N3 ¯X/(2N3 − 3) and ¯C is the constant of integration. The solution for V

In what follows we solve the Eqn. (3.10) numerically. In doing so we determine ˙V (0) from
(3.12) for the given value of V (0). To deﬁne whether the model allows decelerated or accelerated
mode of expansion we also study the behavior of deceleration parameter q deﬁnes as

V ¨V
˙V 2 = −

q = −

From (3.15) it can be easily established that

V→¥ q −→ −(1− n2) < 0,

since n2 < 1/2.

Thus we see that spinor ﬁeld nonlinearity generates late time acceleration of the Universe.
and (3.9) for the EoS parameter w we ﬁnd

Finally let us see, what happens to EoS (energy of state) parameter. In view of (2.20a), (2.20b)

.

(3.18)

Since we are interested in qualitative picture here, so we set the value of problem parameters
very simple. Here we set m = 1, X1 = 1, X0 = 1, V0 = 1, l 0 = 1, msp = 1, C0 = 1, k = 1, N3 = 3.
We consider two cases for different combination with l 1 = ±1 and l 2 = ±1. It was found that
depending on the sign of l 2 the model provides two different type of solution, namely a positive
l 2 gives rise to an expanding mode of evolution, whereas a negative l 2 generates oscillatory mode
of evolution. In Figs. 1 and 2 we plotted the evolution of the Universe for a positive and negative
value of l 2, respectively. The sign of l 1 does not give a qualitatively different picture. In Fig. 3
we have plotted the dynamics of deceleration parameter q that shows a late time acceleration. In
Fig. 4 we illustrated the EoS parameter for a positive l 2 that gives rise to an accelerated mode
of expansion. As one sees it is positive at the beginning and becomes negative in the course of
evolution which is in correspondence with present day observations. It should be noted that both
deceleration and EoS parameters are time varying. This fact is also in agreement with the modern
picture of the evolution of the Universe.

IV. CONCLUSION

Within the scope of Bianchi type-III spacetime we study the role of spinor ﬁeld on the evolution
of the Universe. Unlike Bianchi type I, V or V I0 cases where either both spinor mass and spinor
ﬁeld nonlinearity vanish [47–49] or the metric functions are similar to each other, i.e., a1 ∼ a2 ∼ a3
in this case no such problem occurs. As one can see from (2.41) the spacetime remains locally
rotationally symmetric and anisotropic all the time, though the isotropy of the spacetime can be
achieved for a large proportionality constant. As far as evolution is concerned, depending on the
sign of coupling constant the models allows both accelerated and oscillatory mode of expansion.
A negative coupling constat leads to an oscillatory mode of expansion whereas a positive coupling

constants generates expanding Universe with late time acceleration. Both deceleration parameter
and EoS parameter in this case vary with time and are in agreement with modern concept of
spacetime evolution.
