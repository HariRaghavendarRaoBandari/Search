Abstract

We study the possible interior singular points of suitable weak solutions to

the three dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We present an

improved parabolic upper Minkowski dimension of the possible singular set. It

is bounded by 95/63. The result also continue to hold for the three dimensional

incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations without any diﬃculty.

Keywords: Navier–Stokes equations, singular point, Minkowski dimension

1. Introduction

We study the possible interior singular points of suitable weak solutions to

the three dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with unit viscos-

ity and zero external force

(∂t − ∆)U + (U · ∇)U + ∇P = 0

∇ · U = 0

in ΩT = Ω × I = R3 × (0, T ). We assume that the initial data U0 is suﬃciently

regular. The state variables U and P denote the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid and

its pressure.

The study of regularity problem for the Navier–Stokes equations has long

history and huge literature. We mention only a few of them. Scheﬀer [1, 2]

introduced partial regularity for the Navier–Stokes equations. Caﬀarelli, Kohn

and Nirenberg [3] further strengthened Scheﬀer’s results. Lin [4] gave a new

short proof by an indirect argument. Ladyzhenskaya and Seregin [5] gave a

clear presentation of the H¨older regularity. Choe and Lewis [6] studied the

singular set by using a generalized Hausdorﬀ measure. Gustafson, Kang and

Tsai [7] uniﬁed the several known criteria.

We would like to discuss about the two important criteria. For z = (x, t) ∈

ΩT we denote balls and parabolic cylinders by

B(x, r) = {y ∈ R3 : |y − x| < r},

Q(z, r) = B(x, r) × (t − r2, t).

The ﬁrst one is as follows. There exists an absolute positive constant ǫ1 such

that z is a regular point if for some R > 0

R−2ZZQ(z,R)

|U|3 + |P|3/2dyds < ǫ1.

The second one is as follows. There exists an absolute positive constant ǫ2 such

that z is a regular point if

lim sup

r→0

r−1 ZQ(z,r)

|∇U|2dyds < ǫ2.

The contraposition of the regularity criteria provide us some information about

the possible singularities. Although the proof of the latter criterion is actually

depends on the ﬁrst criterion, it has an important application that the one

dimensional parabolic Hausdorﬀ measure of the possible singular points is zero.

We say that a point z ∈ ΩT is a singular point of a suitable weak solution (U, P)

if U is not locally H¨older continuous in any parabolic neighbourhood Q(z, r).

We denote by S the set of all singular points.

There are many diﬀerent notions measuring lower dimensional sets like S.

Another important one is the Minkowski (box-counting) dimension. When we

count the number of uniform boxes to cover the possible singularities, the former

2

criterion gives better information. If we try to use the second one, then the size

of the local cover depends on the point so that we have trouble making a uniform

cover. When one investigate the Minkowski dimension of the singular set, one

should use the ﬁrst kind “for some R” criterion. But, it is diﬃcult to lower

the Minkowski dimension under 5/3 due to the scaling structure of the Navier–

Stokes equations. Thus, the natural strategy is combining the diﬀerent scaled

functionals to lower the power of “R”.

Our objective of this paper is to give an improved bound of the upper

Minkowski dimension of the singular set. We ﬁrst present Theorem 1 about

the regularities. And then we use its contraposition to prove Theorem 2 about

the singularities. We shall give the necessary preliminaries in the next two

sections. Here are the statement of our main results.

Theorem 1. For each γ < 10

63 there exist positive numbers ε < 1 and ρ0 < 1

such that the point z is regular if for some 0 < ρ < ρ0

ZQ(z,ρ)

|∇U|2 + |U|10/3 + |P|5/3dxdt < ερ5/3−γ.

(1)

The number ε depends also on ζ in Lemma 3.

Theorem 2. The parabolic upper Minkowski dimension of the set S of the

possible interior singular points is less than 95
63 .

Remark 1. Note that 10

63 = 0.15873 . . . and 95

63 for
the parabolic upper Minkowski dimension is better than the previous results in

63 = 1.50793 . . . . The bound 95

[8] and [9].

2. Fractal dimensions

There are several diﬀerent ways to measure the amount of sparse sets consid-

ering their complex geometric distribution. Two of the most popular concepts

are the Hausdorﬀ dimension and the Minkowski dimension. We recall here the

parabolic versions of the deﬁnitions.

3

Deﬁnition 1 (The parabolic Hausdorﬀ dimension). For ﬁxed δ > 0 and S ⊂

R3×R, let C(S, δ) be the family of all coverings of parabolic cylinders {Q(zj, rj)}

that covers S with 0 < rj ≤ δ. The α dimensional parabolic Hausdorﬀ measure

is deﬁned as

H α(S) = lim
δ→0

inf

C(E,δ)Xj

rα
j .

The parabolic Hausdorﬀ dimension of the set S is deﬁned as

dimH (S) = inf{α : H α(S) = 0}.

Deﬁnition 2 (The parabolic Minkowski dimension). Let N (S; r) denote the

minimum number of parabolic cylinders Q(z, r) required to cover the set S.

Then the parabolic upper Minkowski dimension of the set S is deﬁned as

dimM (S) = lim sup

r→0

log N (S; r)

− log r

(2)

and the parabolic lower Minkowski dimension of the set S is deﬁned as

dimM (S) = lim inf
r→0

log N (S; r)

− log r

.

If the limit exists, then it is called the parabolic Minkowski dimension of the set

S.

In general, diﬀerent fractal dimensions of the same set S are not equivalent

and they reﬂect the diﬀerent geometric structures of the set. The Minkowski

dimension is strongly related to the Hausdorﬀ dimension and a good control of

the upper Minkowski dimension has a stronger implication. Indeed, from the

deﬁnition it is easy to see that

dimH (S) ≤ dimM (S) ≤ dimM (S),

but both inequalities may be strict. For instance, the set {1/n : n ∈ N} has

the Hausdorﬀ dimension zero but the Minkowski dimension 1/2. We refer the

reader Falconer’s book [10] for the introduction of the fractal geometry.

3. Preliminary lemmas

We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of suitable weak solutions.

Deﬁnition 3 (Suitable weak solutions). Let Ω ⊂ R3 and T > 0. A pair (U, P)

is called a suitable weak solution in ΩT = Ω × (−T, 0) if the following three

conditions are satisﬁed:

1. U ∈ L∞(−T, 0; L2(ΩT )) ∩ L2(−T, 0; H 1

0 (ΩT )) and P ∈ L3/2(ΩT ).

2. There exists a distribution P such that (U, P) solves the incompressible

Navier–Stokes equations in the sense of distributions.

3. (U, P) satisﬁes the local energy inequality: for almost all t ∈ (−T, 0) and

for every non-negative φ ∈ C∞

c (R3 × R) vanishing in a neighborhood of

the parabolic boundary of ΩT

Z |U(·, t)|2φ(·, t)dx + 2Z |∇U|2φdxdt
≤ Z |U|2(∂tφ + ∆φ) + (|U|2 + 2P)U · ∇φdxdt.

(3)

For notational convenience we shall use the following scaled funcitonals.

Deﬁnition 4 (Scaled functionals). Let

A(z, r) = r−1

t−r2<s<tZB+(x,r)

sup

|U(y, s)|2dy

E(z, r) = r−1 ZQ(z,r)
C(z, r) = r−2 ZQ(z,r)
D(z, r) = r−2 ZQ(z,r)

|∇U(y, s)|2dyds

|U(y, s)|3dyds

|P(y, s)|3/2dyds.

Remark 2. The point z in the scale functionals can be suppressed when it is a

ﬁxed reference point and understood obviously in the context.

Notation. We denote A . B if there exists a positive real number C such that

|A| ≤ CB.

We end this section by presenting fundamental inequalities between the

scaled functionals and a critical regularity criterion, which can be found in

5

many papers concerning partial regularity of the Navier–Stokes equations (e.g.

[3], [5]).

Lemma 1 (Interpolation inequality). For any 0 < r < 1 and 0 < θ < 1

C(θr) . θ−3/2A(r)3/4E(r)3/4 + θ3A(r)3/2.

Lemma 2 (Pressure inequality). For any 0 < r < 1 and 0 < θ < 1/2

D(θr) . θD(r) + θ−2C(r).

Lemma 3 (Regularity criterion). There exists a positive constant ζ such that

an interior point z is a regular point if for some positive number r

D(z, r) + C(z, r) < ζ.

Remark 3. The implied constants in Lemma 1 and 2 are absolute. We impose

the restriction 0 < r < 1 for convenience.

4. Proof of Theorem 1

In this section we ﬁx z and suppress it. We divide the proof into a few steps.

Step 1) Suppose that for some ﬁxed ρ < ρ0

ZQ(z,2ρ)

|∇U|2 + |U|10/3 + |P|5/3 ≤ ε(2ρ)5/3−γ

(4)

where the absolute constant ε and γ will be determined later. Then we have

A(ρ) . ε3/5ρ−9γ/10

and E(ρ) . ερ2/3−γ.

(5)

Indeed, the estimate of E(ρ) follows immediately from the deﬁnition. On the

other hand, for the estimate A(ρ) we use the local energy inequality. Let φ be

a smooth cut-oﬀ function supported in Q(z, 2ρ) and ψ ≥ 1 in Q(z, ρ). From the

local energy inequality (3) with the cut-oﬀ function φ, we have, by the H¨older

6

inequality and the assumption (4),

|U|2 + ρ−2ZQ(2ρ)
|U|10/3(cid:17)3/5

A(ρ) . ρ−3ZQ(2ρ)
. ρ−1(cid:16)ZQ(2ρ)
+ ρ−3/2(cid:16)ZQ(2ρ)

|U|10/3(cid:17)3/10(cid:16)ZQ(2ρ)

|P|5/3(cid:17)3/5

|U|3 + ρ−2ZQ(2ρ)

|PU|

+ ρ−3/2(cid:16)ZQ(2ρ)

|U|10/3(cid:17)9/10

. ε3/5ρ−3γ/5 + ε9/10ρ−9γ/10.

Hence we get the ﬁrst part of (5).

Step 2) Let for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N

Rk := ρα−kβ

and θ := ρβ < 1/2

(6)

where the positive constants α and β will be determined later. Iterating the

pressure inequality (Lemma 2), we obtain that

D(R0) + C(R0) . θN D(RN ) +

N

Xk=1

θk−3C(Rk),

which is obvious from an induction argument on N . Due to Lemma 3, it suﬃces

to show that

I := θN D(RN ) . ε9/10

II :=

N

Xk=1

θk−3C(Rk) . ε9/10.

Hence ε depends on the implied constants and ζ in Lemma 3.

Step 3) If

RN = ρα−N β < 2ρ,

(7)

then by the H¨older inequality and the assumption (4)

I = θN D(RN ) . θN R

−3/2

N (cid:16)ZQ(RN )

. ρ(15−15α+25N β−9γ)/10ε9/10.

. θN R

−3/2

N (cid:16)ερ5/3−γ(cid:17)9/10

|p|5/3(cid:17)9/10

7

If the exponent of ρ is non-negative, then we get the desired bound for I. Hence

we should have

γ ≤

15 − 15α + 25N β

9

.

(8)

Using the interpolation inequality (Lemma 1) and the estimates in (5), we have

C(Rk) . (cid:16) ρ

Rk(cid:17)3/2

ρ (cid:17)3
A(ρ)3/4E(ρ)3/4 +(cid:16) Rk

A(ρ)3/2

. ρ(80−60α+60kβ−57γ)/40ε6/5 + ρ(−60+60α−60kβ−27γ)/20ε9/10

and hence

II =

N

Xk=1

If we set

then

θk−3C(Rk) . ρ(80−60α−20β−57γ)/40ε6/5+ρ(−60+60α−60β−40N β−27γ)/20ε9/10.

α =

200 + 180β + 80N β − 3γ

180

,

(9)

II . ρ(5−10N β−21γ)/15ε9/10.

If the exponent of ρ is non-negative, then we get the desired bound for II.

Hence we should have

γ ≤

5 − 10N β

21

.

(10)

Step 4) If we have determined three numbers γ, β and N . Then we get α

from (9). Moreover, we can always make ρ0 small enough so that, for example,

the condition (6) holds. So it suﬃces to ﬁnd values γ, β and N satisfying (7),

(8) and (10). Combining the necessary conditions (8), (9), and (10), we have

γ ≤

1
21

min{−4 − 36β + 44N β, 5 − 10N β}.

(11)

To satisfy the condition (7), we need 0 ≤ α − N β − 1 and hence

γ ≤

20 + 60β − 60N β

3

.

Now we can take N β = 9/54, then (11) gives

γ ≤

10
63

−

12
7

β.

8

We can choose γ close enough to 10

54N .
Then the other numbers α, ρ0 and ε are determined accordingly. This completes

63 by choosing a large number N and β = 9

the proof of Theorem 1.

5. Proof of Theorem 2

It suﬃces to estimate the Minkowski dimension of the set

S ∩ [0, 1]4.

since all the estimates have the translation invariant bounds. Theorem 1 implies

that if z is an interior singular point, then for all r < ρ0

εr5/3−γ ≤ ZQ(z,r)

|∇U|2 + |U|10/3 + |P|5/3.

Now, ﬁx 5r < ρ0 and consider the covering {Q(z, r) : z ∈ S}. By the Vitali

covering lemma, there is a ﬁnite disjoint sub-family

{Q(zj, r) : j = 1, 2, . . . , M }

such that S ⊂ S Q(zj, 5r). Summing the above inequality at zj for j =

1, 2, . . . , M yields

M

M εr5/3−γ ≤

Xi=1
≤ ZΩT

ZQ(zj ,r)

|∇U|2 + |U|10/3 + |P|5/3

|∇U|2 + |U|10/3 + |P|5/3 < ∞.

Let N (S ∩ [0, 1]4; r) denote the minimum number of parabolic cylinders Q(z, r)

required to cover the set S ∩ [0, 1]4. Then

N (S ∩ [0, 1]4; r) ≤ M . r−5/3+γ

and hence

lim sup

r→0

log N (S ∩ [0, 1]4; r)

− log r

≤ 5/3 − γ.

This completes the proof of Theorem 2.

6. Magnetohydrodynamic equations

This section is a kind of remark. We refer the reader to Davidson’s mono-

graph [11] for the background material of magnetohydrodynamics. The three

dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations described by

∂tU − ∆U + (U · ∇)U − (B · ∇)B + ∇P = 0

∂tB − ∆B + (U · ∇)B − (B · ∇)U = 0

∇ · U = 0, ∇ · B = 0,

has a suitable weak solution satisfying the local energy inequality

(|∇U|2 + |∇B|2)φdxdt

0 ZΩ

(|U|2 + |B|2)φdx + 2Z t
ZΩ
≤ Z t
0 ZΩ
+Z t
0 ZΩ

(|U|2 + |B|2)(φs + ∆φ)dxdt

(|U|2 + |B|2 + 2P)U · ∇φ − 2(B · U)(B · ∇φ)dxdt.

Moreover, Lemma 1, 2, and 3 continue to hold with the replaced scaled func-

tional

C(z, r) = r−2 ZQ(z,r)

|U(y, s)|3 + |B(y, s)|3dyds.

They are the essential ingredients used in the proofs. By the same way one

can easily prove the following theorem, which has a direct application to the

parabolic upper Minkowski dimension of suitable weak solution to the MHD

equations and we omit the tedious repetitions.

Theorem 3. For each γ < 10

63 there exist positive numbers ε < 1 and ρ0 < 1

such that the point z is regular if for some 0 < ρ < ρ0

ZQ(z,ρ)(cid:0)|∇U|2 + |∇B|2(cid:1) +(cid:0)|U|10/3 + |B|10/3(cid:1) + |P|5/3dxdt < ερ5/3−γ.

One may ﬁnd the necessary information, for example, in the papers [12],

[13], [14] and [15].
