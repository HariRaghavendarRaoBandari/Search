eties have (non-canonically) isomorphic Chow motives with coeﬃcients in any noethe-
rian local ring Λ by comparing the pushforward of the constant intersection complexes
through ﬂopping contractions.

0. Introduction

Certain strong relations between birational minimal models have long been sus-
pected. Kollár [Kol] proved that 3-dimensional birational Q-factorial terminal mini-
mal models have isomorphic Hodge structures on intersection cohomology groups by
employing intersection cohomology theory. For higher dimensions, it was proven by

Batryev [Bat] that birational Calabi-Yau manifolds have the same Betti numbers by
using p-adic integration. This result was extended by Wang [Wang1] to the classes
of K-equivalent smooth projective manifolds which in particular applies to birational
smooth minimal models. With the aid of motivic integration developped by Denef and
Loeser these results were further reﬁned [DL] to the equivalence of Hodge numbers.
Most of the results nowadays are either established by certain integration formalism
to obtain “numerical results” [Wang2], or are restricted to particular cases of ﬂops
to obtain rather strong “geometric conclusions” [LLW],[FW]. A series of conjectures
concerning K-equivalent proper smooth varieties are proposed in [Wang2, Section 6]
and explained in [Wang3, Section 4.3]. The ﬁrst one of these conjecture is to ﬁnd
an algebraic correspondence between K-equivalent projective smooth varieties that
identiﬁes their Chow motives. This article makes a progress in this direction.

The main result (3.4) of this paper is of a style intermediating between these
two ends, stating that two smooth projective varieties related by a semismall ﬂop
(section 2) have isomorphic Chow motives with coeﬃcients in a local ring. Following
several ideas of [Kol], [BM], [dCM1] and [dCM2], we adopt perverse sheaves to
compare the motives of smooth varietes under semismall ﬂops.

For motives with coeﬃcients Q, the decomposition theorem is available and it
suﬃces to compare local systems over respective strata (2.1). This can be achieved
by employing arc spaces to compare irreducible components of the ﬁbres.

The decomposition theorem can fail, even for ﬁelds of positive characteristics.
Nevertheless, this diﬃculty can be remedied for coeﬃcients in local rings by the
extensibility of morphisms between sheaves from an Zariski open subset (3.3) and
then to the ability to lift invertibles in the category of ﬁnite associative algebras over
a noetherian commutative local ring (4.2). These properties permit an abstract gluing
of isomorphisms of perverse sheaves across strata. An immediate consequence (3.5) of
the main result is that the singular cohomology groups H k(X, Z) of a smooth variety
X are unchanged under semismall ﬂops.

I am indebted to Professor Chin-Lung Wang for his supervision and innumerable
inspiring discussions, and I am thankful to Chen-Yu Chi, Luc Illusie, Ming-Lun Hsieh,
Hui-Wen Lin, Jeng-Daw Yu and many others for their advices.

1. Preliminaries and notations

1.1. Derived categories of ctf complexes and perverse sheaves. — We will
always work in the category of separated schemes of ﬁnite type over the complex num-
bers C, an object whereof is simply called a variety henceforth. We will mostly com-
pare complexes of sheaves in the bounded derived category Db
ctf(Xcl, Λ)
of cohomologically constructible complexes sheaves of Λ of ﬁnite tor-dimension on X

ctf(X, Λ) = Db

with coeﬃcients in a (commutative unital) noetherian local ring Λ. See [Sch] and
[SGA4.5, exposé 2] for a reference. Henceforth we will simply call sheaves in place of
sheaves of Λ-modules We summerise brieﬂy here important properties of this category.

Recall that an (algebraic) Whitney stratiﬁcation of an algebraic variety X is a
partition (called stratiﬁcation) of X into ﬁnite disjoint collection of Zariski locally
closed subsets T = {Ti}i∈I , whereof each element (called stratum) T is a smooth
subvarieties such that the closure T ⊆ X is a union of strata. Every stratiﬁcation
admits a Whitney stratiﬁcation as reﬁnement.

According to [BBD], by a stractiﬁcation of a algebraic variety X we mean a

Whitney stratiﬁcation of equidimensional strata of X.

We call a sheaf F of Λ-modules on X a locally constant constructible sheaf, if there
is an open covering {Ui}i∈I (in the classical topology) of X such that the restriction
of F to each Ui is a ﬁnitely generated free A-module.

A sheaf F is called constructible if there is a Whitney stratiﬁcation of X along
each stratum of which F is locally constant constructible. A complex of sheaves is
called cohomologically constructible if every cohomology sheaf of it is constructible.
A complex of sheaves K is called of ﬁnite torsion dimension if each of its stalk Kx
is isomorphic in the bounded derived category of Λ-modules Db(Λ) to a complex of
projective Λ-modules.

Let Db

ctf(X, Λ) denote the full subcategory of Db(X, Λ) of bounded cohomologically

constructible complexes of ﬁnite torsion dimension (ctf for short).

Amongst the most important topological properties of an algebraic map is the
preservation of constructibility. Given an morphism of varieties f∶ X → Y , the six
operations are induced on the subcategories:

f∗, f!∶ Db

ctf(X, Λ) → Db

ctf(Y, Λ),

as well as the derived tensor product

f ∗, f !∶ Db

ctf(Y, Λ) → Db

ctf(X, Λ),

Ð ⊗L

Ð∶ Db

ctf(X, Λ) × Db

ctf(X, Λ) → Db

ctf(X, Λ)

and the internal homomorphism
RHomX (Ð, Ð) ∶ Db

ctf(Y, Λ)op × Db

ctf(X, Λ) → Db

ctf(X, Λ).

Proofs of the constructibility can be found in [Sch, section 4.2.2]. As an immediate
consequence, R HomX (K, L) ∈ Db
ctf(Spec C, Λ) is a ctf Λ-complex for any pair K, L ∈
Db

ctf(X, Λ).

There is a natural biduality functor (Ð)∨ ∶ Db

ctf(X, Λ)op deﬁned by
X Λ is the dualising complex, and πX∶ X → Spec C

ctf(X, Λ) → Db

K = RHom (K, ωX), where ωX = π!
is the constant map.

Perverse t-structures of middle perversity are deﬁned on these categories of the

following manner:

pDctf

≤0 = K ∈ Db

ctf(X, Λ) ∶ (∀i∶ S ↪ X stratum of X) (∀k > dim S) Hki∗K = 0

and

pDctf

≥0 = K ∈ Db

ctf(X, Λ) ∶ (∀i∶ S ↪ X stratum of X) (∀k < dim S) Hki!K = 0 .

The heart P(X, Λ) of this t-structure is simply called the category of perverse sheaves
on X. We remark that P(X, Λ) is a noetherian abelian category and that it is not in
general artinian.

1.2. Arc spaces. — See [DL] for detailed properties of arc spaces. To each variety
X we can associate a projective system of schemes Lm(X), called the mth truncated
arc space of X, which represents the functor HomSpec C Spec C[t]~tm+1, X that
sends a C-scheme T to HomSpec CT ×Spec C Spec C[t]~tm+1, X. Let L(X) be the
limit of this system, which represents the functor HomSpec C(Spec CJtK, X). When X
is smooth of equidimension n, the natural projection πm,X∶ Lm(X) → X is a Zariski
locally trivial Amn-ﬁbration over X.

When there is a birational morphism f∶ X → Y between smooth varieties, one can
read the structure of the system of induced morphisms Lm(f)∶ Lm(X) → Lm(Y )
from the relative canonical divisor J = KX~Y and vice versa. We have an important
lemma about the structure of a birational morphism [DL, Lemma 3.4].

Lemma 1.1. — Let X and Y be smooth algebraic varieties over k, of pure dimension
d and let f∶ X → Y be a birational morphism. For k in N, let

L(X)k∶ = {γ ∈ L(X) ∶ (ordt J)(γ) = k and L(f)γ ∈ L(Y )} .

For m ∈ N, let Lm(f)∶ Lm(X) → Lm(Y ) be the morphism induced by f , and let
Lm(X)k be the image of L(X)k in Lm(X). Then, for all k in N with m ≥ 2k, the

following holds.

(a) The set Lm(X)k is a union of ﬁbres of Lm(f).
(b) The restriction of Lm(f) to Lm(X)k is a piecewise trivial ﬁbration with ﬁbre

Ak onto its image.

Besides Lm(X)k, we introduce the notations

L(X)≤k∶ = {γ ∈ L(X) ∶ (ordt J)(γ) ≤ k and L(f)γ ∈ L(Y )} ,
L(X)>k∶ = {γ ∈ L(X) ∶ (ordt J)(γ) > k and L(f)γ ∈ L(Y )} ,

etc, to indicate the subvarieties of arcs of corresponding orders, and denote their

images by Lm(X)≤k, Lm(Y )≤k = Lm(f)Lm(X)≤k, etc.

MOTIVIC EQUIVALENCE UNDER SEMISMALL FLOPS

Moreover, for a subset S ⊆ X, we add the restriction sign Ð S

to indicate those

arcs γ on X that are originated from S, that is to say γ(0) ∈ S. For example,
m,X(S) ⊆ Lm(X). Notations concerning order of arcs in the previous
Lm(X)S

= π−1

paragraph also applies to this situation.

2. Comparison over strata

In this section, we will consider complexes of sheaves of abelian groups and the

bounded derived categories Db(X, Z) thereof.

Let X and X ′ be smooth varieties of dimension n, Y a varieties, and f∶ X → Y and
f ′∶ X ′
→ Y be proper birational morphisms. Suppose that X and X ′ are K-equivalent
through f ′−1○f . That is to say, given any common resolution g∶ Z → X and g′∶ Z → X ′,
the relative canonical divisors Kg and Kg′ are equal. We suppose further that f and
f ′ are semismall in the sense that dim X ×Y X = n and dim X ′ ×Y X ′ = n. In this case
f ′−1 ○ f is refered to as a semismall K-equivalence.

One important example we shall bear in mind is that when f∶ X → Y is a semismall
→ Y is a ﬂop, X and X ′ are K-equivalent through f ′−1○f .

crepant resolution and f ′∶ X ′
In this case f ′−1 ○ f is refered to as a semismall ﬂop.

A stratum T ∈ T is called f -relevant if dim f −1(T) ×T f −1(T) = n.

The goal of this section is to prove the following 2.1.

Proposition 2.1. — For a suﬃciently ﬁne stratiﬁcation T of Y , on each rele-
vant stratum T ∈ T of dimension d, there is an isomorphism Rn−df∗Zf −1(T ) ≅
Rn−df ′

∗Zf ′−1(T ).

Taking the dual local system,

Corollary 2.2. — Under the assumptions of 2.1, let i∶ T → Y be the embedding.
There is an isomorphism Rn−di!f∗ZX ≅ Rn−di!f ′

∗ZX ′

Here is a plan of the proof.

Given an initial stratiﬁcation T , we shall recursively study the isomorphism and
at the same time reﬁne the stratiﬁcation and the common resolution Z if necessary.
To be more precise, assume the comparison is done on a union of strata, which is
Zariski open in Y . We shall pick a stratum dense, say T , in the complement, blow
up Z accordingly, and establish the comparison on a Zariski open subset of T in
case T is relevant, by means of arc spaces. Then we shall reﬁne the stratiﬁcation by

6

splitting up T into the Zariski open subset and some other smooth Zariski locally
closed subvarieties. By noetherian induction, this will prove 2.1.

Let T ⊆ Y be a Zariski locally closed smooth conncected subvariety, of dimension d.
∗Z are (classically) locally constant constructible,

Suppose that Rn−df∗Z and Rn−df ′
and that f and f ′ are ﬂat over T .

We begin with some observations on the irreducible components. Consider the

projection

πm,f −1(T )∶ Lm(X)f −1(T )

→ f −1(T)

from the space of mth truncated arcs with origin in f −1(T), to f −1(T).
Lemma 2.3. — Under the above assumptions, the irreducible components of Lm(X)f −1(T )
correspond to those of f −1(T) under πm,f −1(T ), and that
Rπm,f −1(T ),!∶ Z[2mn] ≅ Z.

Proof. — Let E ⊂ f −1(T) be an irreducible component. Then Lm(X)E
is a Zariski
locally trivial Amn-ﬁbration over E, and hence is irreducible. Consequently, the
irreducible components of Lm(X)f −1(T )
correspond to those of f −1(T) under the
projection πf −1(T ),m∶ Lm(X)f −1(T )
→ f −1(T). Since it is a Amn-ﬁbration, by the
base change property for exceptional push-forwards, the projection πm,f −1(T ) induces

Rπm,f −1(T ),!∶ Z[2mn] ≅ Z.

In regards to 2.3, we have

as well as

and

Rπm,f −1(T ),!∶ Z[2mn] ≅ Z on f −1(T) ⊆ X

Rπm,f ′−1(T ),!∶ Z[2mn] ≅ Z on f ′−1(T) ⊆ X ′

Rπm,h−1(T ),!∶ Z[2mn] ≅ Z on h−1(T) ⊆ Z.

is dominated by one certain irreducible component of Lm(Z)h−1(T )

Lm(Z)h−1(T )
Lm(X)f −1(T )

.

For each irreducible component F ⊆ Lm(Z)h−1(T )

, let

δ(F) = mink ∶ Lm(Z)≤k ∩ F ≠ ∅ .

Lemma 2.4. — Under the above assumptions, assume in addition that m ≥ 2δ(F)+1
for all irreducible components F ⊆ Lm(Z)h−1(T )
. Then δ(F) = dim F −dim Lm(g)(F) ≥
dim F −(n + d)~2 + mn, and that the equality holds exactly when F dominates an ir-
reducible component of maximal dimension (n + d)~2 + mn.

Proof. — By 1.1, the additional assumption m ≥ 2δ(F) + 1 make arcs L(Z)≤δ(F ) of
contact order ≤ δ(F) all stabilised(i.e. there is a piecewise aﬃne ﬁbration structure),
in particular, Lm(g) is a Zariski locally trivial Aδ(F )-ﬁbration when restricted to
Lm(Z)≤δ(F ) with image Lm(X)≤δ(F ). Therefore

dimLm(Z)≤δ(F ) ∩ F − dimLm(X)≤δ(F ) ∩ Lm(g)(F) = δ(F).

On the other hand, Lm(Z)≤δ(F ) ∩ F is Zariski open and dense in F , and that

Lm(X)≤δ(F ) ∩ Lm(g)(F) is Zariski open and dense in Lm(g)(F), so

δ(F) = dimLm(Z)≤δ(F ) ∩ F − dimLm(X)≤δ(F ) ∩ Lm(g)(F)

= dim F − dim Lm(g)(F).

Recall that the assumption on semismallness forces that dim f −1(T) ≤ (n + d)~2,

and hence dim Lm(g)(F) ≤ dim Lm(X)f −1(T )

≤ (n + d)~2 + mn.

The equality holds exactly when dim Lm(g)(F) = (n + d)~2 − mn.

Proof. — In regards to 2.4, we are left to prove that each irreducible component E ⊆

This is clear by the surjectivity of Lm(g) and the fact that Lm(g) is an Aδ(F )-

ﬁbration over an Zariski open set of E.

For convenience, we may and we shall reﬁne the resolution as Z ′

that dim F = (n−1)+mn for all F . The condition then becomes δ(F) ≥ (n−d)~2−1 =∶ δ.

so that U = V ∩ V ′. Then it suﬃces to verify that V and V ′ are Zariski open and
dense in T . We shall do that for V only.

We may assume that T is irreducible.

Firstly, V is nonempty.

If V = ∅, then by the piecewise ﬁbration structure 1.1

dimLm(Z)>δh−1(t) ≥ δ + 1 +(n − d)~2 + mn for all t, so

From the arguments above, one sees that

Proposition 2.8. — Under the assumptions of 2.4, the semismallness of f implies
that of f ′, and that dim X ×Y X ′ = n. Moreover, if a stratum T is f -relevant, then it
is also f ′-relevant.

Finally, we can prove 2.1.

Proof of 2.1. — As is sketched right after the statement of 2.1, the proof proceeds by
recurrence on strata.

We assign a partial order on the set of strata. There is a relation between two

strata T ≤ T ′ if T ⊆ T ′.

Suppose that T ∈ T is a stratum, and that on every T ′ ∈ T with T ≤ T ′ but T ≠ T ′,
the comparison Rn−df∗ZT ≅ Rn−df ′
∗ZT has been established. Apply 2.7 to T , so
that there is a resolution Z1 → Z and an Zariski open W ⊆ T with Rn−df∗ZW ≅
Rn−df ′
∗ZW . Reﬁne the stratiﬁcation on T so that W is one of the strata. This
ﬁnishes the recursive step.

Clearly by the noetherian assumption on Y , the recurrence eventually stops. That

ﬁnishes the proof.

Proposition 2.9. — In coeﬃcient Q, we have
Rf∗Q ≅ Rf ′

∗Q

Consequently, if X and X ′ are projective, then the Chow motives in Q-coeﬃcients
are isomorphic

M(X)Q ≅ M(X ′)Q

MOTIVIC EQUIVALENCE UNDER SEMISMALL FLOPS

Proof. — Tensoring with Q the isomorphisms provided by 2.1, we have

Rn−df∗Q ≅ Rn−df∗Z ⊗L f ∗Q ≅ Rn−df∗Z ⊗L Q

∗Z ⊗L Q ≅ Rn−df ′

Then

Rf∗Q[n] ≅ ࣷT ∈T

ICT, Rn−df∗Q ≅ ࣷT ∈T

ICT, Rn−df ′

∗Q ≅ Rf ′

∗Q[n].

An argument in [dCM2], which we will reproduce in the next section, shows that

M(X)Q ≅ M(X ′)Q.

As the decomposition theorem is available only with coeﬃcients in ﬁelds of character-
istic 0, in order to extend the result to more general coeﬃcients, we shall study the
extensions of perverse sheaves across strata in the next section and forth.

3. Recollement of perverse sheaves

Provided with 2.1 we are left with extending the isomorphisms across strata, in
other words, to glue the isomorphisms of perverse sheaves over strata. The gluing
is not automatic. For nice general expositions of gluing of perverse sheaves, confer
[BBD] or [Jut].

Now ﬁx a noetherian coeﬃcient ring Λ. Throughout this section, we work on the

ctf(Y, Λ) of ctf Λ-complexes with respect to a stratiﬁcation T of
derived categories Db
Y obtained in 2.1. According to the notations of [BBD], we will write f∗, f ∗, f!, f !
for the derived functor, whereas standard cohomology sheaf functors will be denoted
by oHk, and the perverse cohomology sheafs by pHk

Emphasis is put on the compatibility with restriction maps, whereof we will be
using in a crucial way. Observe also that in the situation of semismall K-equivalence,
since the Borel-Moore homology groups are freely generated by the respective sets of
irreducible components of dimension n (2.8), the restriction map is surjective, and so
is the other restriction map. Besides, the compatibility of product structure provides
a link between isomorphism of sheaves and of Chow motives.

Corollary 3.2 ([dCM2]). — In the situation of semismall K-equivalence f ′−1 ○

phisms f∶ X → Y and f ′∶ X ′ → Y of complex algebraic varieties. Suppose that f and

Rf∗Λ[n] ≅ Rf ′

Suppose further that X and X ′ are projective varieties, then there is an isomorphism
of motives in coeﬃcient Λ

M(X)Λ ≅ M(X ′)Λ.

Corollary 3.5. — Under the assumptions of 3.4, there are isomorphisms of singular
cohomology groups

H ∗(X, Z) ≅ H ∗(X ′, Z)

and

for all prime p.

H ∗(X, Fp) ≅ H ∗(X ′, Fp)

Proof. — Since H k(X, Z) and H k(X ′, Z) are ﬁnitely generated abelian groups, it
suﬃces to compare the ranks and the p-primary components H k(X, Z)[p∞] and
H k(X ′, Z)[p∞] for all primes p. 3.4 provides in particular H k(X, Λ) ≅ H k(X ′, Λ)
for all local rings Λ. Taking Λ = Q, we see that rankZ H k(X, Z) = dimQ H k(X, Q) =
dimQ H k(X ′, Q) = rankZ H k(X ′, Z). Taking Λ = Zp the ring of p-adic integers,
we have on the other hand H k(X, Z)[p∞] ≅ H k(X, Zp)[p∞] ≅ H k(X ′, Zp)[p∞] ≅
H k(X, Z)[p∞]. This proves H k(X, Z) ≅ H k(X ′, Z). The latter statement is similarly
proven by taking Λ = Fp.

4. Proof of 3.3

In this section we work abstractly on a noetherian abelian category C locally ﬁnite
over a noetherian local ring Λ. This means that the noetherian abelian category C
has on every Hom set HomC(A, B) a ﬁnitely generated Λ-module structure for every
A, B ∈ C, such that each composition map

HomC(B, C) × HomC(A, B) → HomC(A, C)

is Λ-bilinear for every A, B, C ∈ C.
Given objects A, C ∈ C such that HomC(A, C) = 0, we shall study the Λ-module
C(C, A) of extensions of C by A. Recall that elements of Ext1
C(C, A) are short

̂ψ ⋅ [(B′, γ, δ)] = [(B, α, β)] ⋅ ϕ−1 in Ext1
C(C, A). We will invoke the following easy

lemma.

Lemma 4.2. — Let Λ be a noetherian commutative local ring, and A be an (asso-
ciative unital) Λ-algebra which is a ﬁnitely generate Λ-module. Given any surjection
of Λ-algebras ρ∶ A → B, the induced group homomorphism A×
→ B× is surjective as
well.

maximal left ideals of A. Thus it suﬃces to show that for every maximal left ideal

Proof. — We prove ﬁrstly that mA ⊆ J(A), where J(A) is the Jacobson radical of
A, and similarly that mB ⊆ J(B). The Jacobson radical is the intersection of all
Q ⊆ A, the pullback P in Λ is equal to m, or equivalently that Λ~P is a ﬁeld. To
this eﬀect, consider the irreducible left A-module A~Q, whose endomorphism algebra
D = EndA(A~Q) is a ﬁnitely generated division (Λ~P)-algebra. We identify Λ~P with
a subring of the centre of D. Let 0 ≠ x ∈ Λ~P be an element. We shall ﬁnd its inverse
element in Λ~P . Firstly, x has a two-sided inverse x−1 in D. Since D is a ﬁnite (Λ~P)-
algebra, every element is integral over Λ~P . Let (x−1)n + a1(x−1)n−1 + . . . + an = 0 be
a monic polynomial relation for x−1, with coeﬃcients ai ∈ Λ~P . Multiplying it with
xn−1, we obtain x−1 = −a1 + . . . + anxn−1 ∈ Λ~P . Hence x−1 is a inverse of x in Λ~P ,
so Λ~P is a ﬁeld. The inclusion mA ⊆ J(A) shows in particular that A~J(A) is a
quotient of A~mA, thus a semisimple artinian (Λ~m)-algebra.

Now given b ∈ B×, the reduction b ∈ B~J(B) is invertible as well. Since A~J(A) →
B~J(B) is an epimorphism of semisimple artinian algebras, there clearly exists a ∈ A
such that a ∈ (A~J(A))× and ρ(a) = b. Since ρ−1(J(B)) = J(A), there exists
j ∈ J(A) such that ρ(a + j) = b.
It remains to verify that a + j ∈ A×. Let a′ ∈ A
such that aa′ = a′a = 1 ∈ A~J(A). Then (a + j)a′ ∈ 1 + J(A), and that (a + j)a′ is
invertible according to the characterisation. Similarly, a′(a+j) is invertible. Therefore
a + j ∈ A×.

Let M = R ⋅ [(B, α, β)] be the sub-R-module generated by [(B, α, β)]. Then
M = R ⋅ [(B′, γ, δ)] ⋅ ϕ. Thus ̂ϕ induces an automorphism on M . Put A = R and
B = image(A → EndΛ(M)). Then the lemma gives an invertible ̂ϕ′ ∈ A× = AutC(A)
such that ̂ϕ′ ⋅ [(B, α, β)] = [(B′, γ, δ)]. Therefore there is a diagramme of exact
