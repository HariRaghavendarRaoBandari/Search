Abstract

Including on-site electronic interactions described by the multi-orbital Hubbard model we study

the correlation eﬀects in the electronic structure of bulk palladium. We use a combined density

functional and dynamical mean ﬁeld theory, LDA+DMFT, based on the ﬂuctuation exchange ap-

proximation. The agreement between the experimentally determined and the theoretical lattice

constant and bulk modulus is improved when correlation eﬀects are included.

It is found that

correlations modify the Fermi surface around the neck at the L-point while the Fermi surface tube

structures show little correlation eﬀects. At the same time we discuss the possibility of satellite

formation in the high energy binding region. Spectral functions obtained within the LDA+DMFT

and GW methods are compared to discuss non-local correlation eﬀects. For relatively weak inter-

action strength of the local Coulomb and exchange parameters spectra from LDA+DMFT shows

no major diﬀerence in comparison to GW .

INTRODUCTION

Transition metals have their density of states characterized by a partially ﬁlled narrow d-

band, superimposed on a broad free electron-like sp-band. The shape of the d-band especially

in the 3d series is a consequence of the construction of the d-orbitals, as they overlap only to

a limited extent with orbitals on neighboring atoms and consequently the hopping integrals

between d-orbitals is small, as is the bandwidth. This points towards the importance of

short range strong Coulomb repulsion for the 3d elements. An additional ingredient in the

3d series is the appearance of magnetism. In a partially ﬁlled shell of a free atom the exchange

interaction between electrons favors the parallel alignment of electron spins (Hund’s rule). In

solids electrons enter in extended states/orbitals so there is a competition between the kinetic

energy of the electron which favors no spin alignment and the exchange interaction which

favors spin alignment. If the band is narrow the energy gain from the exchange interaction

may win and the spin alignment is favored.

In that sense, the occurrence of magnetism

in the 3d series is a consequence of the narrowness of the 3d band. A quantitative theory

to explain the electronic structure and hence the physical properties of 3d-elements has

been consistently developed during the last decades in the form of the combined density

functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean ﬁeld theory (DMFT) [1–4] which is generally

referred to as the LDA+DMFT method [4, 5] (LDA = local density approximation).

In

the LDA+DMFT scheme the LDA provides the ab initio material dependent input (orbitals

and hopping parameters), while the DMFT solves the many-body problem for the local

interactions. Therefore the LDA+DMFT approach is able to compute, and even predict,

properties of correlated materials. Theoretical results obtained with LDA+DMFT can be

compared with experimental data obtained, for example, by photoemission spectroscopy

(PES) [6].

In particular, this technique measures spectral functions, i.e., the imaginary

part of the one-particle Green function, and thus determines correlation induced shifts of

the spectral weight. Indeed, most experimental investigations on the electronic structure of

the 3d metal Ni rely on PES [7, 8]. Braun et al. [9] demonstrated the importance of local

correlations in Ni by exploiting the magnetic circular dichroism in bulk sensitive soft X-ray

PES measurements. One of the dominant correlation eﬀects observed in the PES data for

Ni is the satellite peak situated at 6 eV below the Fermi level [10, 11]. This feature is not

captured by LDA, but is well explained by LDA+DMFT [12]. LDA+DMFT also reproduces

3

the correct width of the occupied 3d bands and the exchange splitting [10, 12, 13].

As LDA+DMFT is very successful for 3d elements, this motivates us to investigate the

applicability of LDA+DMFT to 4d transition metal elements. Transition metals from the 4d

series have larger bandwidths compared to that of the 3d elements and correspondingly larger

kinetic energies, which will favor an itinerant band-like picture over an atomic-like localized

picture and somewhat weaker correlation eﬀects. In our present study we focus on the 4d

metal palladium. Despite being in the same group as Ni in the periodic table, the physical

properties of Pd are very diﬀerent, so a theoretical study including local and non-local corre-

lation eﬀects is particularly desirable. Due to its interest in fundamental condensed matter

theory, and its industrial use as a catalyst and for hydrogen storage, the electronic structure

of Pd has been widely studied over the years. As a late 4d transition metal element, Pd is

not far from the ferromagnetic instability: it has a high density of states at the Fermi level

and a large Stoner enhancement in the magnetic susceptibility [14]. On expansion of the

lattice constant Pd turns ferromagnetic, as shown by DFT calculations [15]. Experimental

studies involving PES have been used in the search for signatures of electronic correlations in

Pd such as the existence of satellites in the spectral function [16, 17]. Liebsch [18, 19] inves-

tigated the satellite formation mechanism in detail using many-body methods, pointing out

the importance of taking electron-hole and hole-hole scattering into account by ladder-like

summations in the T -matrix formulation. M˚artensson and Johansson predicted a satellite

in Pd [20], placing the satellite at 8 eV binding energy, in good agreement with later experi-

mental ﬁndings (∼ 8.5 eV) by Chandesris et al. [16]. The method employed in Ref. [20] was

semi-empirical, using thermodynamic input data. In this study we will discuss the satellite

formation in Pd using ab inito self-consistent state-of-art calculations as well.

Complementary information can be obtained from the analysis of the Fermi surface (FS).

Features of the Fermi surface can be experimentally probed by photoemission spectroscopy

and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements. The so called Kohn anomalies [21] may

appear in the phonon dispersion relations of metals, arising from virtual scattering of con-

duction electrons from state k to k′ connected by nesting vectors q, making the determi-

nation of possible FS nesting of interest. The appearance of a Kohn anomaly in Pd is still

debated [22, 23],

Palladium is perhaps the best studied high-susceptibility paramagnet and played an im-

portant role in elucidating several aspects of the theory of spin ﬂuctuations. Among the

4

elements, Pd is traditionally taken as the best candidate for observing spin ﬂuctuations be-

cause of its high electronic density of states and large Stoner enhancement in the magnetic

susceptibility. Speciﬁc heat experiments [24] showed a reduction in the electronic speciﬁc

heat coeﬃcient of 7% in a magnetic ﬁeld of about 10 T suggesting that strong spin ﬂuctua-

tions appear in Pd. The reduction of spin-ﬂuctuation contributions to the electronic speciﬁc

heat at high magnetic ﬁelds is well established theoretically by several works: Doniach and

Engelsberg [25], Berk and Schrieﬀer [26], B´eal-Monod and co-authors [27, 28], and many

others. In their classical works, the Crabtree group experimentally investigated the evidence

of spin ﬂuctuations in Pd by measuring the cyclotron eﬀective masses and the amplitude of

the dHvA eﬀect as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld [29, 30]. These typical measurements pro-

vide in principle information about spin-ﬂuctuation contributions to the conduction electron

properties. While the former allows one to obtain information about the density of states

at the Fermi level, which determines the electronic speciﬁc heat, the latter measures the

diﬀerence in volume between the spin up and spin-down Fermi surfaces, which determines

the magnetization. The absence of signiﬁcant ﬁeld dependence of the cyclotron eﬀective

mass and the spin splitting factor [29, 30] implies that the spin-ﬂuctuation contributions

to the electronic speciﬁc heat and static spin susceptibility χ = M/H are not appreciably

aﬀected by applied ﬁelds up to ∼ 13 T. This is consistent with the theoretical estimations

made by Brinkmann and Engelsberg [31] and Hertel et al. [32] that magnetic ﬁelds much

larger than 13 T are required to suppress the spin ﬂuctuations in Pd. The magnetic proper-

ties and dynamical ﬂuctuations in Pd were discussed recently by Larson et al. [33]. Highly

accurate LDA calculations were performed to estimate the parameters entering in Moriya’s

spin-ﬂuctuation theory [34], in particular the Landau functional for Pd was used to connect

critical ﬂuctuations beyond the local density approximation with the band structure. It was

pointed out [33] that the key parameter for the non-trivial properties of Pd is the mean-

square amplitude of the spin ﬂuctuations, which is a non-local quantity determined by the

momentum dependent spin susceptibility in a large part of the Brillouin zone, and therefore

non-locality is expected to play a signiﬁcant role in the physical properties. It is one of the

aims of this work to identify local and non-local correlation eﬀects on the spectral function

by comparing results obtained via LDA+DMFT and GW [35] methods.

The results presented here include the electronic structure, the Fermi surface and nesting

vectors of Pd, and the satellite formation in the high binding energy region of the density of

5

states. Most of our results have been obtained within the full potential linearized muﬃn-tin

orbitals (FPLMTO) method implemented within the RSPt code [36], which has previously

proven to be able to accurately determine ground state quantities within LDA+DMFT for

3d transition metals [37, 38]. Self-consistent quasiparticle GW calculations have also been

performed [39, 40], which allows us to discuss the eﬀect of non-local electronic correlations in

Pd. The paper is organized as follows: Section I is an introduction. In Section II we present

computational methods and details of the calculations. Section III A presents total energy

data, from which we extract the optimal U and J values, to match the experimental and

the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters. We also present results concerning the onset

of ferromagnetic long range order upon lattice expansion. In Section III C the calculated

spectral function of palladium is shown, and the relation to the photoemission satellite is

discussed in detail. The eﬀect of non-local correlations is discussed in Section III D.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND DETAILS

A. The LDA+DMFT method

Correlation eﬀects in the valence Pd 4d orbitals were included via an on-site electron-

Coulomb matrix elements Umm′m′′m′′′ are expressed in the usual way [41] in terms of Slater

integrals. Since speciﬁc correlation eﬀects are already included in the local spin-density

approximation (LDA), so-called “double counted” terms must be subtracted. To take this

into account, we employed the interpolation double counting scheme [42]. For the impurity

solver a ﬂuctuation exchange (FLEX) [43] type of approximation was used for the multior-

bital case [44–46]. In contrast to the original formulation of FLEX [43], the spin-polarized

T -matrix FLEX (SPTFLEX), used for the present calculations treats the particle-particle

and the particle-hole channel diﬀerently [44–46]. While the particle-particle processes are

important for the renormalization of the eﬀective interaction, the particle-hole channel de-

scribes the interaction of electrons with the spin-ﬂuctuations, which represents one of the

most relevant correlation eﬀects in Pd. In addition the advantage of such a computational

scheme is that the Coulomb matrix elements can be considered in a full spin and orbital

6

rotationally invariant form, for realistic materials.

B. The self-consistent quasiparticle GW method

In recent years, ﬁrst-principle calculations involving the GW approximation [35] are be-

coming more popular. In particular self-consistent GW formulations are promising because

they can more accurately calculate quantities like band gaps compared to “one-shot” GW

approaches [40].

In such methods the ﬁrst step is to compute the band structure of the

solid, usually within DFT-LDA. Using the random phase approximation (RPA), the den-

sity response function is then calculated and used to evaluate the dielectric function and

the screened Coulomb interaction W . The matrix elements of the self-energy are added as

corrections to the LDA eigenvalues, and the eﬀective potential is self-consistently updated.

In spite of the simpliﬁed formalism of calculation, compared to that of the full GW scheme,

a good agreement with experiment for several materials has been obtained [40].

In this

study we employed the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method [39, 40]. Our

main object of interest is the self-energy corrected eigenvalue for band n and Bloch vector

k,

Ekn = ǫkn + Zkn∆Σkn

(1)

where the operator ∆Σkn = hΨkn| Σ(r, r′, ǫkn) − Vxc(r) |Ψkni. The self-energy is given in

terms of the Green’s function and the screened Coulomb interaction W : Σ(r, r′, ω) =

i

2π R dω′G(r, r′, ω − ω′)W (r, r′, ω′)e−δω′. From the slope of the real part one can get the

renormalization factor

Zkn = (cid:20)1 −

∂ReΣkn(ω)

∂ω

(cid:21)−1

.

In a direct comparison with the LDA+DMFT results, GW calculations reveal if signiﬁcant

non-local correlation eﬀects occur in Pd.

C. Technical details

The LDA+DMFT calculations were done using the full-potential FPLMTO code

RSPt [36] as a base for the underlying density functional theory calculations. The RSPt cal-

culations were based on the local-density approximation with the parametrization of Perdew

and Wang [47] for the exchange-correlation functional. Three kinetic energy tails were used,

7

with corresponding energies 0.3, -2.3 and -1.5 Ry. Palladium is a face-centered cubic metal,

and the k-mesh we used had the size 16 × 16 × 16 for the equations of state, 24 × 24 × 24 for

the other calculations, and Fermi-Dirac smearing with T = 400 K (the same temperature as

was used for the imaginary frequency Matsubara mesh). The muﬃn-tin radius was set to

2.45 Bohr atomic units (a.u.), and was kept constant throughout for all unit cell volumes.

For the charge density and potential angular decomposition inside the muﬃn-tin spheres, a

maximum angular momentum lmax = 8 was set. The calculations included spin-orbit cou-

pling and scalar-relativistic terms within the muﬃn-tin spheres, unless otherwise noted. The

SPTFLEX impurity solver was implemented in the Matsubara domain, and we used 2048

imaginary frequencies and an electronic temperature 400 K. The analytic continuations of

the self-energy from imaginary frequencies to the real energy axis in the complex plane were

performed by Pad´e approximants [48].

The QSGW scheme used in this study is implemented into the LMSuite package [39, 40],

which is based on the full-potential linear muﬃn-tin orbitals code by M. Methfessel et al.

[49]. The muﬃn-tin radius was chosen to be 2.63 a.u, and the integration of the Brillouin

zone (BZ) was mapped with 24 × 24 × 24 k-points. For the GW calculation, we reduced

the k-points to 6 × 6 × 6 [40]. A double-κ basis set with lmax = 4 was used, including the

semicore 4p states with local orbitals. This basis set allows for an accurate description of the

high-lying conduction band states. Spin-orbit coupling was included within the muﬃn-tin

spheres.

We point out that both the RSPt and the QSGW methods are employing the full-potential

linearized muﬃn-tin orbital basis set, but using diﬀerent implementations. As can be seen

in Section III D, this causes no major diﬀerences between the RSPt and the QSGW LDA

level results.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

tions are considered as adjustable parameters in this study, but can in principle be calculated

within a ﬁrst-principles framework [54]. In this section we have decided to adjust the U and

J values until the calculated equation of state (EOS) energy-volume curve reproduces the

experimental lattice constant (see Table I for a collection of experimental lattice constants

from the literature).

In Figure 1 (top) EOS curves for diﬀerent values of U and J are presented. The experi-

mental volume has been marked out. The equilibrium volume V0 and bulk modulus B0 for

each of the curves can be seen in Table II. It is seen (Figure 1, top) that U = J = 0 eV (red

curve), i.e. the LDA, underestimates the volume, which is commonly known. The general-

ized gradient approximation (GGA) to the exchange-correlation potential, as pointed out for

Pd in Ref. 55, overestimates the lattice constant, and leads to a ferromagnetic ground state

and is therefore unsuitable. As the value of U is increased, the computed lattice constant is

increased towards the experimental value. For U = 1.0 eV the calculated V0 and B0 for dif-

ferent exchange parameters J are given in Table II, and the values are closer to experiment

than the LDA value. The eﬀect on the EOS by varying the exchange parameter J can be

seen in Figure 1 (bottom, dashed lines). The equilibrium volumes are tabulated in Table II,

and give a standard deviation of 0.05 a.u.3, which is of the same order as the scattering in the

data for room temperature (See T = 296 K in Table I). At U = 1.1 eV and J = 0.3 eV, V0

is overestimated compared to the experimental value and B0 is underestimated. Increasing

U to 1.3 eV leads to an even larger V0 and smaller B0. Varying J at this value of U gives

a standard deviation of 0.18 a.u.3, which is an order of magnitude larger then the standard

deviation at U = 1.0 eV. The eﬀect of exchange J on the volume is larger for U = 1.3 eV

than for U = 1.0 eV, but it is still below the eﬀect of the experimentally observed thermal

expansion (see Table I). The increase of J (for a ﬁxed U = 1.3 eV) decreases the equilibrium

volume, which is opposite to the trend given by increasing U. However, this is a small eﬀect

and not relevant to this study.

Based on the results presented in this Section, U = 1.0 eV and J = 0.3 eV can be taken

as reasonable choices in order to be able to reproduce the lattice constant and bulk modulus

within our LDA+DMFT method.

Relativistic eﬀects were treated using the scalar relativistic approximation.

B. Ferromagnetic instability

It is known that palladium is on the verge of ferromagnetism, having a large density of

states at the Fermi level D(EF ) leading to a large static susceptibility. An early theory

that tried to explain the magnetic transition in itinerant electron systems was the Stoner

model. According to this model, a magnetic state is favored over a non-magnetic state when

the criterion D(EF )I > 1 is fulﬁlled, where I is the Stoner parameter [56]. This criterion

points to the possibility of inducing magnetic order by increasing D(EF ). In some cases, this

can be achieved by reducing the eﬀective dimensionality of the system. To create magnetic

order attempts have been made to lower the dimensionality of Pd systems, e.g by creating

nanoparticles/wires [57–59] or thin ﬁlms [60]. There also exists density functional theory

studies that indicate that bulk palladium turns ferromagnetic as the volume is expanded

[15, 61–63].

In Figure 2 the magnetic moment in units of µB is plotted as a function of lattice constant.

12

For the LDA within the scalar-relativistic approximation (red curve) a magnetic onset is

brought about at a lattice constant of 7.65 a.u. This is ∼ 4% larger than the experimental

lattice constant, which is in accordance with previous studies, where the magnetic onset

varies between a 1%-6% increase of the lattice constant. Hong and Lee [63] points out that

this variance could be due to the sensitivity of D(EF ) on the k-point mesh, and shows that

D(EF ) is diﬃcult to fully converge even at dense mesh sizes. Note that the curve reaches

a maximum (∼ 0.4 µB) and then decreases toward zero magnetic moment at large lattice

constants. A full charge transfer to the d-states has then been accomplished, leading to fully

occupied d-states with no net magnetic moment [15].

We next calculated the magnetic moment as a function of increasing lattice constant

within the LDA+DMFT scheme, using the scalar-relativistic approximation, and setting

U = 1.0 eV and J = 0.3 eV (Figure 2, green curve). The magnetic transition is pushed

further upwards in volume, compared to the scalar-relativistic LDA curve (red), giving a

transition ﬁrst into a “low-moment” and then into a “high-moment” state. We also note

that the LDA+DMFT curve more or less coincide with the LDA curve at larger lattice

constants. The system is then close to having a fully occupied d-band, where correlation

should have negligible eﬀect.

DMFT is able to capture some dynamical spin ﬂuctuation eﬀects, and this could explain

the suppression of the magnetic moment at those intermediate volumes where the LDA still

gives noticeable moments.

C. Density of states and Fermi surface

1. Spectral functions and the formation of satellite structure

Density of states (DOS) at the experimental lattice constant is presented in Figure 3.

Including electronic correlations, for increased values of the local Coulomb parameter U in

the higher binding energy region a satellite structure develops. We tuned J for ﬁxed U

and saw no signiﬁcant change in DOS (not shown). Hence, the satellite position is mostly

insensitive to the value of the exchange parameter J.

The quasiparticle weights Z = (1 − ∂Re[Σ(E)]/∂E|EF )−1 for the diﬀerent U are reported

in Figure 3, being in the range Z = 0.975 − 0.916 for U = 1 − 4 eV. These correspond to

sp.heat/mLDA = 1.66, where m∗

sp.heat is estimated from

electronic speciﬁc heat measurements and mLDA is taken from band structure calculations

[64, 65], which is considerably larger than what we get in this study. It should be noted

that the electron-phonon coupling λe−ph is not included in our self-energy, and previous

theoretical studies have shown this quantity to be on the order λe−ph ∼ 0.35 − 0.41 [66, 67].

Recent angle-resolved PES (ARPES) by Hayashi et al. [65] estimated the electron-phonon

coupling to be λe−ph ∼ 0.39, and the electron-electron and electron-paramagnon coupling
to be λe−e + λe−para ∼ 0.08, leading to an eﬀective mass m∗

ARP ES/mLDA = 1 + λtot ∼ 1.5.

Using Hayashi et al.’s [65] value for λe−ph and our calculated self-energy gives the eﬀective
mass m∗/mLDA = 1.42 − 1.48, for U = 1 − 4 eV, which is in good agreement with Hayashi

14

et al. [65], but still underestimating the data from speciﬁc heat measurements. It should be

noted that our quasiparticle weights Z are averaged over the BZ, while Ref. 65 investigated

speciﬁc paths in the BZ, while also being a surface sensitive study. This comparison however

shows that our results are of similar magnitude.

Just below the Fermi level a dominant peak with a relatively large value of the density

of states is situated at ∼ −0.15 eV (marked by A) for all investigated U values. A second

major peak (B) is situated in the middle of the valence band at ∼ −2.7 eV at U = 0, and

is shifted to ∼ −2.5 eV as U is increased. The third major peak (C) is at the bottom of

the d-band at ∼ −4.7 eV, and is shifted to ∼ −4.4 eV as correlation is increased. The

contributions of diﬀerent bands to the peaks in the DOS can be inferred by studying the

spectral function along high symmetry lines in the BZ, see Figure 4.

Concerning the high-energy binding region in the photoemission spectra, there exist dis-

crepancies on the order of ∼ 0.5 eV between experiment and band structure calculations,

as pointed out by Kang et al. [68]. The LDA seems to overestimate the bandwidth of Pd

compared to the measured PES bandwidth, and some experimental states are located closer

to the Fermi level than the theoretical states [68–71]. It was proposed [68] that surface and

correlation eﬀects could modify the LDA band structure, explaining the discrepancies. It

is not altogether clear how to separate these two eﬀects from each other since both bulk

and surface states will contribute to the PES, especially for low photon energies. Kang et

al. [68] performed a combined PES and LDA level band structure calculation study for Pd,

and their results indicated that surface eﬀects could indeed explain the bandwidth narrow-

ing. However, they also ruled out many-body correlation eﬀects since they found no trace

of a satellite in the PES. The missing satellite might be due to the neglect of the 4p − 4d

photoabsorption threshold in Ref. [68], since the energy range of interest (around ∼ 55 eV

photon energy) does not seem to be investigated. The experimental photoemission studies

in Refs. [16, 17] scan this range and do indeed ﬁnd a satellite. The 4p − 4d photoabsorption

process can be viewed as follows: A photon with energy at the 4p core level will excite a core

electron to the Fermi level. As the 4p core hole is ﬁlled by a valence electron, the resulting

valence hole will interact with the photoabsorbed electron and contribute to the satellite

intensity. Note that the 4p − 4d photoabsorption will aﬀect the satellite intensity, but not

its position [72]. The satellite position will be determined by the valence hole spectral func-

tion, which we access in our calculations. We can not capture the contribution from the

15

core levels on the spectra, and hence the satellite intensity we obtain should not be directly

compared with experiment. From comparison with Figure 3 and the experimental satellite

position 8.5 eV [16], the U-value needed to reproduce the satellite position can be estimated

to be between 2-3 eV. By including correlation we also get a shift of the B and C peaks to

lower binding energy, in better agreement with experiment. The B peak position has been

measured at −2.55 eV (Ref. 70), −2.4 eV (Ref. 17) and ∼ −2.5 eV (estimated from Ref. 68),

which indicates that the LDA positions this peak at too high binding energy (∼ −2.7 eV

16

in this study) and that including correlation will improve the peak position in comparison

with experiment. We here mention that no attempt was made to model the surface states,

instead only bulk calculations were performed. Note that matrix element eﬀects were also

not taken into account in this study.

As shown in Section III A a U-value above 1.0 eV would overestimate the equilibrium

lattice constant. Hence, to capture the experimental spectra, a diﬀerent U is needed than

the one that captures the experimental volume. That the U-value needed to reproduce

spectral features might diﬀer from the value that reproduce the ground-state properties has

been observed also for Ni [37, 73], which makes it plausible that similar behavior is observed

for Pd.

It is interesting to discuss the satellite formation in Pd, in comparison with Ni. The

eﬀect of electron correlation on one-electron removal energies from a partially ﬁlled band

is described in terms of interactions between three-body conﬁgurations, one hole plus one

electron-hole pair giving rise to hole-hole and hole-electron scattering [18, 19]. The eﬀective-

ness of these scattering processes depends not only on the strength of the screened on-site

electron-electron interaction, but also on the orbital occupations involved in the scatter-

ing process.

In particular on the number of empty d-states necessary for the creation of

three-particle conﬁgurations since no electron-hole pair can be added to a completely ﬁlled

band: in the case of nickel where only the minority-spin band has a sizable number of empty

states available the creation of a majority-spin hole will be followed by scattering processes

involving only opposite spin electron-hole pairs. The interaction strength for this channel

is of intensity proportional to U, while the creation of a minority-spin hole will involve a

scattering of strength proportional to U − J with parallel spin electron-hole pairs only. In

Pd both spin channels are symmetric at the equilibrium lattice parameter and fewer empty

d-states are present in comparison with Ni. Despite the reduced scattering events in gen-

erating electron-hole pairs the existence of the T -matrix is enough in generating a satellite

structure, although the scattering event is not very eﬀective, since the satellite is hardly

discernible for valence state spectroscopy.

2. Fermi surface

Many calculations for the Fermi surface of Pd exist in the literature [64, 75, 76]. We

present a cut of the LDA Fermi surface in the kx − ky plane (Figure 5, bottom left) together

with a projection of the 3-dimensional FS sheets (Figure 5, top left). The Fermi surface

geometry contains the closed electron surface around the Γ point, and a set of hole ellipsoids

at the X points. Open hole surfaces consists of cylinders, extending in the [100] and [010]

directions (i.e. along the X −W −X paths) and intersecting in pairs at the symmetry points

X, see top right of Figure 5. The open hole surfaces are particularly interesting as they are

associated with the large eﬀective masses and contribute substantially at the density of states

near the Fermi level [76]. The Kohn anomaly [21] in the slope of the [ξξ0] transverse acoustic

branch of the Pd phonon dispersion is attributed to Fermi surface nesting between these open

hole cylinders (see Ref. 22 and references therein). Previous calculations also predicted the

existence of small L-pockets, which were seen if spin-orbit coupling was taken into account

[64, 75]. These L-pockets were later conﬁrmed by magnetoacoustic measurements [77].

The orbital character of the FS sheets can be determined by investigation of the orbital-

resolved spectral function, see Figure 4. The tube structure (stemming mostly from the

ﬂat band between the W and the X symmetry points) has mostly t2g character, which was

pointed out already by Kanamori [78]. Switching on correlation through DMFT, the FS can

be seen in Figure 5 (bottom right). No large diﬀerence between the Fermi surface within the

LDA is seen, and no topological transition occurs. The Fermi surface nesting vector believed

to be responsible for the Kohn anomaly seen in the phonon dispersion of Pd is estimated to

be q = 2π

a [0.30, 0.30, 0], in close agreement with previous studies [22].

We end this section by pointing out that the negligible change in diameter of the tube

structure as correlation is increased is reassuring. This is so since the Kohn anomaly is well

captured already at the level of the LDA [22], and a change in radius would change also the

FS nesting, destroying the agreement with experiment.

D. Local and non-local correlation eﬀects

In order to investigate the eﬀect of non-local electron correlations on the electronic struc-

ture of Pd, calculations were also performed using the QSGW method. Band structure;

FIG. 6: (Color online) Blue color map corresponds to LDA+DMFT, U = 1.0 eV and

J = 0.3 eV. Top left: Band structure along high symmetry directions in the BZ. Top right:

spectral functions and Fermi surfaces were calculated using the experimental volume.

In Figure 6 (top left) the band structure is plotted along high symmetry lines within

the Brillouin zone. The bands within the LDA from RSPt (green solid lines) and from

QSGW (blue dashed lines) coincide well. Turning on correlation eﬀects, the bands are

modiﬁed compared to the LDA result. The QSGW (red dots) and the LDA+DMFT (blue

energy scale) are seen to be nearly coinciding around the Fermi level, and diﬀerences are

seen at higher energies. Around the Γ-point for energies between −6 eV and the Fermi

level, the QSGW bands are shifted towards the Fermi level to a larger extent than the

LDA+DMFT bands. For energies more negative than −6 eV, the lowest band is shifted

20

downwards in energy to a larger extent than the LDA+DMFT bands. The trends (shift

upwards/downwards in energy) is however the same for both methods, indicating that the U-

value used in LDA+DMFT (U = 1.0 eV) is too small to reproduce the correct quasiparticle

eigenvalue position. This was also seen when comparing the LDA+DMFT spectral function

with experiment in Section III C.

In Figure 6 (top right) the DOS calculated within the QSGW method is plotted (red

line). The DOS corresponding to the initial starting LDA solution is plotted in blue. The

eﬀect of correlation is most easily seen by inspecting the three main peaks in the DOS. In

Figure 6 (top right) we also show the LDA+DMFT k-integrated spectral function. The

spectral functions within LDA+DMFT are calculated along a horizontal complex contour

at a distance δ from the real axis, giving a broadening to the DOS. We performed LDA

density of states calculations within RSPt along the real axis as well, and found excellent

agreement with the LDA from QSGW (not shown). As correlation is turned on, similar

trends in the three main peaks can be seen for the QSGW metod as was seen within the

LDA+DMFT method. One main diﬀerence is that LDA+DMFT can produce the high

energy satellite, while QSGW can not. This can attributed to the T -matrix ladder diagrams

which are present in the LDA+DMFT self-energy, but not in the QSGW self-energy. There

exist extensions of the GW formalism that allow for T -matrix diagrams, see Refs. [79, 80].

In Figure 6 (bottom left) the calculated Fermi surface in a cut of the kx − ky-plane

from both LDA+DMFT and QSGW can be seen. Both of the two methods changes the

FS slightly. The topology of the sheets is unchanged, but the k-space volume enclosed by

the sheets shows some eﬀect of correlation. The largest changes can be seen in the tube

structure running along the X − W − X symmetry directions. In the case of LDA+DMFT

(blue intensity scale) the tube radius is slightly reduced, while for QSGW (green line) the

radius is slightly increased. A diﬀerent cut in the BZ, including the L-pocket, is shown in

Figure 6 (bottom right). QSGW and LDA+DMFT display similar trends in the change of

the FS, mainly the beginning of a “neck”-formation in the Γ − L direction and a decreasing

of the L-pocket diameter. Note that within the LDA solution used as a starting point for the

QSGW, the L-pocket and the “tongue” feature are connected along the X −L−X direction.

We found that this was attributed to the use of the tetrahedron k-point integration method,

which pushes the hole sheet slightly upwards in energy, creating the connection.

To conclude this section, we note that non-local eﬀects captured by the QSGW method

21

on the spectral functions come close to our LDA+DMFT data.

IV. CONCLUSION

Electron correlation is commonly assumed to aﬀect the electronic structure of the 3d

elements to a larger degree than in the 4d elements due, in part, to the diﬀerence in d-

state bandwidth. By electronic structure calculations within a LDA+DMFT context, we

could show that even though the LDA can provide a reasonable description of the electronic

structure of Pd, correlation eﬀects give important contributions to ground-state and spectral

properties. We could improve the equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus from that

of the LDA, and on expansion of the lattice constant Pd was shown to be ferromagnetic with

a magnetic moment suppressed by spin ﬂuctuations. The spectral function calculated with

LDA+DMFT supported a formation of a satellite in the high-energy binding region, while

at the same time improving the band positions in comparison with experiment. The spectral

function and the Fermi surface showed no major diﬀerence between the LDA+DMFT and

QSGW method, and in particular the nesting vector in the [ξξ0]-direction was only slightly

changed from its LDA value.

Within the presently investigated LDA+DMFT method spin ﬂuctuation eﬀects were

shown to inﬂuence the magnetic transition volume, pushing it to higher values than within

the LDA. These results could point to that spin ﬂuctuations could be important also for the

case of low dimensional systems like surfaces, nanoparticles and epitaxial thin ﬁlms of Pd.

This study conﬁrms the band narrowing and favors the satellite formation seen in experi-

ment for Pd. Previously the diﬀerence between the PES and band structure calculations has

been attributed to surface eﬀects [68], but our results indicate that also correlation should

be taken into account, as was pointed out earlier based on empirical arguments [17, 20]. The

LDA+DMFT method should be able to probe the eﬀect of correlation on the PES on an ab

initio level, and further studies in conjunction with bulk and surface sensitive PES should

hopefully make it possible to disentangle surface and correlation eﬀects from each other.

By performing GW calculations with a k-dependent self-energy, we could investigate

the eﬀect of non-local correlations on the spectral properties of Pd. A closer inspection into

momentum dependence of other properties could be interesting. Especially interesting would

be to look into momentum dependent susceptibilities, which would be needed to correctly

22

address paramagons, which were recently observed in Pd [81].
