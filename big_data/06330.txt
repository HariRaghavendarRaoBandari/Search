The relaxation rate of a stochastic spreading process in a closed ring

Department of Physics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel

Daniel Hurowitz, Doron Cohen

The relaxation process of a diﬀusive ring becomes under-damped if the bias (so called aﬃnity)
exceeds a critical threshold value. This is related to the spectral properties of the pertinent stochastic
kernel, aka delocalization transition. We ﬁnd the dependence of the relaxation rate on the aﬃnity
and on the length of the ring. Additionally we study the implications of introducing a weak-link
into the circuit, and illuminate some subtleties that arise while taking the continuum limit of the
discrete model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the absence of topology the relaxation time of
a stochastic sample is either diﬀusion limited or drift
limited, depending on whether the bias is small or
large, respectively. However, in a topologically closed
circuit, as the bias is increased, the relaxation spec-
trum becomes complex and the relaxation-rate becomes
diﬀusion-limited rather than drift-limited. In related ap-
plications the “circuit” might be a chemical-cycle, and
the “bias” is the so called aﬃnity of the cycle.

In the present work we consider a minimal model for
a topologically closed circuit, namely, an N site ring
with nearest-neighbor hopping. The dynamics can be
regarded as a stochastic process in which a particle hops
from site to site. The rate equation for the site occu-
pation probabilities p = {pn} can be written in matrix
notation as

dp
dt

= W p,

(1)

If the ring were opened, then the N → ∞ limit would
correspond to Sinai’s spreading problem [1–4], aka a ran-
dom walk in a random environment, where the transition
rates are allowed to be asymmetric. Such models have
diverse applications, notably in biophysical contexts of
populations biology [5, 6] pulling pinned polymers and
DNA unzipping [7, 8] and in particular with regard to
molecular motors [9–12].

In the absence of topology W is similar to a real sym-
metric matrix, and the relaxation spectrum is real. Alas,
for a ring the aﬃnity is a topological-invariant that can-
not be gauged away, analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm
ﬂux. Thus the theme that we are addressing here is re-
lated to the study of of non-Hermitian quantum Hamil-
tonians [13–15]. In a previous work [16] we have illumi-
nated the relation between the sliding-transition and the
complexity-threshold, aka “de-localization transition”, as
the aﬃnity is increased.

The outline is as follows: In Sec.II we discuss the relax-
ation in the case of an homogeneously disordered diﬀu-
sive sample, contrasting non-trivial topology (ring) with
simple geometry (box). The eﬀect of disorder is demon-
strated in Sec.III, and heuristic considerations are used
in order to explain the dependence of the relaxation rate
on the aﬃnity and on the length of the ring. In Sec.IV
we discuss the delocalization transition. Namely, we ﬁnd

the threshold value of the aﬃnity beyond which the re-
laxation becomes under-damped. Then we extract the
relaxation rate from the characteristic equation using an
“electrostatic picture”. Sections V and VI concern a ring
that has an additional weak-link that forms a bottleneck
for diﬀusion, though not blocking it completely. Several
appendices are provided to make the presentation self-
contained.

II. DIFFUSIVE SAMPLE: RING VS BOX

The rate equation Eq. (1) involves a matrix W whose
oﬀ-diagonal elements are the transition rates wnm, and
whose diagonal elements are −γn such that each col-
umn sums to zero. For a clean ring and with near-
neighbor hopping, the rates are uniform but asymmet-
ric, and are equal to −→w = wes/2 for forward hopping,
and ←−w = we−s/2 for backward hopping. The W matrix
takes the form

−γ ←−w 0
W = 
−→w −γ ←−w ...
0 −→w −γ ...


...

...



(2)

with γ = −2w cosh(s/2). Due to translational invariance,
the matrix W can be written in terms of momentum
operators

W = wes/2+iP + we−s/2−iP − 2w cosh(cid:16) s
2(cid:17)

(3)

From here it is easy to see that the eigenvalues {−λν} of
the W matrix are

λν = 2w (cid:20)cosh(cid:16) s

2(cid:17) − cos(cid:18) 2π

N

ν + i

s

2(cid:19)(cid:21)

(4)

The non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) is associated
with λ0 = 0. The complexity of the other eigenvalues im-
plies that the relaxation process in not over-damped. A
straightforward analysis of the time-dependent spreading
process, see e.g. [17], show that drift velocity and the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient are given by the following expressions:

v0 = (−→w − ←−w )a = 2wa sinh(s/2)
(−→w + ←−w )a2 = wa2 cosh(s/2)

D0 =

1
2

(5)

(6)

where a is the lattice constant. Note that in Eq. (3) we
used the lattice constant as a unit of length (“a = 1”)
else the following replacement is required: P 7→ aP .
It is convenient to consider the continuum limit of the
rate equation Eq. (1). In this limit we deﬁne D(x) = wa2
and v(x) = swa, and the continuity equation for the den-
sity ρ(xn) = (1/a)pn becomes the Fokker-Planck diﬀu-
sion equation:

dρ
dt

= −

d

dx(cid:20)−D(x)

dρ

+ v(x)ρ(x)(cid:21)

(7)

One can easily ﬁnd the spectrum of the relaxation modes
(λn > 0) for either “ring” or “box” geometry. The
boundary conditions are respectively either of Neumann
type or periodic. The result is

L (cid:19)2
λν [ring] = (cid:18) 2π
λν [box] = (cid:16) π
L(cid:17)2

(9)

where for the ring ν = ±1,±2, ..., while for the box
ν = 1, 2, 3, .... Clearly Eq. (8) is consistent with Eq. (4).
The relaxation rate Γ is determined by the lowest eigen-
value

Γ ≡ Re[λ1]

(10)

For the “ring” the result is determined solely by the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient and the length L = N a of the ring:

L (cid:19)2
Γ[ring] = (cid:18) 2π

D

(11)

while for the “box” it becomes drift-limited if the bias is
large:

Γ[box] = (cid:20)(cid:16) π
L(cid:17)2

+(cid:16) v

2D(cid:17)2(cid:21) D

(12)

It is important to realize that in the latter case we have
a “gap” in the spectrum, meaning that λ1 does does not
diminish in the L → ∞ limit, hence the relaxation time
is ﬁnite.

III. DISORDERED RING

In the presence of disorder, the forward and backward
rates are random numbers. By considering the long time
limit of the time-dependent spreading process it is still
possible to deﬁne the drift velocity v and diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient D. The results depend in an essential way on the
aﬃnity of the cycle

where s is deﬁned via the sample average

S(cid:9) ≡ N s
(cid:28)ln(cid:18)←−w

−→w(cid:19)(cid:29) ≡ −s

(13)

(14)

2

Additionally it is useful to deﬁne threshold values sµ via
the following expression:

(cid:28)(cid:18)←−w
−→w(cid:19)µ(cid:29) ≡ e−(s−sµ)µ

Here, as in [16–18] we assume that the rates are

−→w = w e+En/2
←−w = w e−En/2

(15)

(16)

(17)

where the “activation energies” En are box distributed
within [s − σ, s + σ]. Accordingly the thresholds of
Eq. (15) are

sµ =

1
µ

σµ (cid:19)
ln(cid:18) sinh(σµ)

(18)

For small σ one obtains the approximation sµ = (1/6)µσ2
which agrees with the continuum-limit-deﬁnition of µ in
Eq. (D1).

The relaxation spectrum of a disordered ring can be
found numerically by solving the characteristic equation

det(z + W ) = 0

(19)

and the relaxation rate is deﬁned as Γ = Re[λ1]. For a
given realization of disorder we regard S(cid:9) as a free pa-
rameter. Making S(cid:9) larger means that all the En are
increased by the the same constant. We deﬁne the com-
plexity threshold Sc as the value beyond which the spec-
trum becomes complex. This means that for S(cid:9) < Sc the
relaxation is over-damped like in a box, while for S(cid:9) > Sc
the relaxation is under-damped like in a ring. It has been
established [16] that

Sc = N s1/2

(20)

In the upper panel of Fig.1 we calculate the dependence
of Γ on S(cid:9) for a representative disordered ring via direct
diagonalization of the W matrix. We also indicate in
the ﬁgure the complexity threshold Sc. For sake of com-
parison we also calculate in the lower panel of Fig.1 the
relaxation rate Γ for a box conﬁguration, i.e. one link
of the ring has been disconnected. In the latter case the
topological aspect is absent and Sc = ∞.
First we would like to test whether Eq.(11) and Eq.(12)
can be used in order to predict Γ. For this purpose v and
D are independently calculated using a standard pro-
cedure that is outlined in [17].
Indeed we ﬁnd a nice
agreement.

Having realized that Γ of a ring is determined by D, we
would like to understand theoretically the observed non-
monotonic variation as a function of s. In the N → ∞
limit the calculation of D can be carried out analytically
[2], using equations that are displayed in Appendix A. In
this limit D = 0 in the range s < s1/2 where the spectrum
is real; then it becomes inﬁnite for s1/2 < s < s2, and
ﬁnite for s > s2. The result of the calculation in the
latter regime is displayed in the ﬁgure. As expected it

The upper panel is for a ring, while for the lower panel one
bond has been disconnected (“box”). The blue data points
have been obtained via numerical diagonalization, whereas
the solid and dashed green lines are based on numerically
calculated D and v. The lower and upper solid lines in the
left panel are based on the analytical estimates of D, namely
Eq. (6) and Eq. (A2) respectively. The vertical dashed lines
are the thresholds s1/2 and s2.

Note that this expression roughly coincides with the
clean ring result that is based on Eq. (6). In the range
s1/2 < s < s2 the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is large but ﬁnite
and becomes N dependent. In [18] a heuristic approach
has been attempted in order to ﬁgure out this N depen-
dence. In the present work we would like to adopt a more
rigorous approach. We shall deduce the N dependence of
Γ analytically from the characteristic equation Eq. (19).
We shall also provide an optional derivation for Eq. (21).

 

IV. EXTRACTING Γ FROM THE

CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION

3

With the W of the rate equation Eq. (1) it is possi-
ble to associate a symmetric real matrix H as explained
in Appendix B. The latter has real eigenvalues −ǫk with
k = 0, 1, 2, 3, .... Using the identity of Eq. (C3), and set-
ting the units of time such that w=1, the characteristic
equation Eq. (19) takes the following form

(z − ǫk(s)) = (−1)N 2(cid:20)cosh(cid:18) S(cid:9)

2 (cid:19) − 1(cid:21)

(22)

Yk

Taking the log of both sides, this equation takes the form
of an electrostatic problem in two dimensions:

V (x, y) + iA(x, y) = V (0)

(23)

where z = x + iy. On the left we have a complex poten-
tial Ψ(z) of charges that are located along the real axis
at ǫk. The constant V (x, y) curves correspond to po-
tential contours, and the constant A(x, y) curves corre-
sponds to stream lines. The derivative Ψ′(z) corresponds
to the ﬁeld, which can be regarded as either an electric or
a magnetic ﬁeld up to a 90deg rotation. The identiﬁca-
tion of the right hand side as V (0) ≡ V (0, 0) is based on
the observation that z = λ0 = 0 has to be an eigenvalue,
corresponding to the steady state solution. On the real
axis (x = ǫ, y = 0), the potential is

V (ǫ) =Xk

ln (|ǫ − ǫk|) ≡Z ln (|ǫ − ǫ′|)̺(ǫ′)dǫ′ (24)

In the electrostatic picture we regard the spectral func-
tion ̺(ǫ) as a charge distribution.
In Appendix E we
provide a step by step account of the electrostatic pic-
ture to helps gain insight for V (ǫ). The bottom line is
summarized by Fig.2. For full disorder, if s < s1/2 the en-
velope at the origin has a negative slope hence the equa-
tions V (x) = V (0) has real solutions, and the relaxation
spectrum {λk} comes out real. For s > s1/2 the envelope
at the origin has a positive slope and the spectrum be-
comes complex, hence Sc for full disorder is determined
by Eq. (20).

We would like to estimate the relaxation rate in the
non-trivial regime S(cid:9) > Sc, where the topology of the
ring is reﬂected. Given the spectral density ̺(x), the
electrostatic potential is

V (x, y) =

1

2Z ln(cid:2)(x − x′)2 + y2(cid:3) ̺(x′)dx′

Expanding to second order near the origin, we have

V (x, y) ≈ C0 − C1x +

FIG. 2. Caricature of the electrostatic picture used to determine the transition to complexity. The panels of the top row display
the integrated density of states that comes from ̺(ǫ). The latter is represented by a cloud along the axes of the lower panels.
A weak-link contributes an isolated charge at the vicinity of the origin, unlike full disorder that ﬁlls the gap with some ﬁnite
density. The associated envelope of the electrostatic potential is displayed as green lines. The dashed red line is V (0). For
µ < 1/2 the equation V (x) = V (0) has real solutions. For µ > 1/2 complex solutions appear.

Notice that C0 = V (0) and C1 = E(0) are the potential
and the electrostatic ﬁeld at the origin. To determine
the real part of the complex gap it is enough to realize
that the equipotential contour V (x, y) = V (0) is approx-
imately a parabola near the origin:

x =

(28)

We deﬁne as a reference the ﬁeld-line A(x, y) = 0 that
stretches through the origin along the X axis to −∞.
The ﬁrst excited eigenvalue is determined by the inter-
section of the V (x, y) = V (0) potential contour with the
next ﬁeld line, namely with A(x, y) = 2π. By deﬁnition
of the stream function A(x, y), which can be regarded
as an application of the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, it is
equivalent to the requirement of having an enclosed ﬂux

condition N (ǫ) = 1 we deduce that ǫ1 ∝ N −1/µ and get

(31)

Comparing with Eq. (11) we realize that consistency re-
quires to assume that D ∝ N (2/µ)−1 for s1 < s < s2, and
D ∝ N 2−(1/µ) for s1/2 < s < s1. The latter result (but
not the former) is in agreement with the heuristic ap-
proach of [18]. In the heuristic approach it has been as-
sumed, apparently incorrectly, that the disorder-induced
correlation-length scales like N throughout the whole
regime s < s2, and becomes size-independent for s > s2.
Apparently the N dependence of the disorder-induced
correlation-length becomes anomalous within the inter-
mediate range s1 < s < s2.

(30)

If all the Cs are proportional to N it follows that
Γ ∝ N −2 as in the case of a clean diﬀusive ring. This
is indeed the case if s > s2. But if s < s2 we have to
be careful about the lower cutoﬀ. From the quantization

We would like to analyze how the relaxation spectrum
is aﬀected once a weak-link is introduced into a diﬀu-
sive ring. We use the continuum limit Eq. (7) for the
purpose of deriving the characteristic equation. In a re-
gion where v(x) and D(x) are constant a free-wave so-

lution ρ(x) ∝ ei˜kx−λt, has to satisfy the dispersion rela-
tion λ = D˜k2 + iv˜k. It is convenient to use the notation
s = v/D, which would be consistent with the discrete-
lattice convention if the lattice constant were taken as

has been deduced from the envelope of the characteristic equa-

complex, indicated by the blue circles. As g decreases, the

For

M0 = U T0U −1, with T0 that involves a wavenumber k
that is determined by D0. For a weak-link we have
M1 = R−1U T1U −1R, where T1 describes the free prop-
agation in the D1 region that has some thickness a. It
is convenient to deﬁne the eﬀective width of the weak
link as ℓ = (D0/D1)a. The only non-trivial way to take
the limit of zero thickness weak-link (a → 0) is to adjust
D1 → 0 such that ℓ is kept constant. This leads to the
following result:

This envelope has a minimum at q = S(cid:9)/2. Accord-

terms of the Lambert function,

Sc = −2W(−g/2)

(47)
This is valid provided S ≫ g, which is self-justiﬁed for
small g. We can use the same procedure in order to
determine the complexity threshold for a given eigen-
value λ in Fig. 3. Recall that the corresponding q is
q2 = L2λ/D0 − S2

A(q) = cosh(S(cid:9)/2) we ﬁnd the q beyond which the spec-

VI. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE

CONTINUUM LIMIT

By reverse engineering, requiring consistency between
Eq. (43) and Eq. (22), we deduce that the electrostatic
potential that is associated with the discretized version
of the characteristic equation for a ring with a weak link
is

V (ǫ) = ln(2(cos(q)−1) −
This potential is plotted in Fig.5, and labeled as “N =∞”.
We would like to reconstruct this potential by means
of Eq. (24). For this purpose we have to ﬁnd the real
eignevalues of the associated H, see Eq. (B6). Formally
the equation det(z + H) = 0 is obtained by setting S(cid:9)=0
in the right hand side (RHS) of Eq. (43), leading to

and g = 10−3 and S(cid:9) = 20. The blue line is the electrostatic
potential of a continuous ring with a defect. The dashed red
line is V (0). The yellow and green lines are reconstructions
using a ﬁnite number of (numerically obtained) charges. By
increasing the number of charges that are included in the
reconstruction, it is clear that the deviation from the blue
line is due to ﬁnite size truncation.
In the lower panel we
display the contribution of the impurity-level charge (dashed
black line) and the quasi-continuum charges (the other lines)
to the reconstructed potential.

k + S2

(cid:9)/4(cid:3) D0/L2,

From Eq. (32) it follows that ǫk =(cid:2)q2

where qk are the roots of the above equation. Using these
“charges” we compute V (ǫ) via Eq. (24) and plot the
result in the upper panel of Fig.5. Some truncation is
required, so we repeat the attempted reconstruction with
N = 10 and N = 23 roots. We observe that the result
converges to the N =∞ limit. The residual systematic
error as ǫ becomes larger is due to ﬁnite truncation of
the number of roots used in the reconstruction.

The characteristic, equation Eq. (43) parallels the dis-
crete version Eq. (22). One should be aware that the
spectral density contains an “impurity” charge ǫ0 as il-
lustrated in the third panel of Fig.2.
It is easy to ex-
plain the appearance of this exceptional charge using the

7

discrete-lattice language. In the absence of a weak link
the diagonal elements of the W matrix are −γ where
γ = wes/2 + we−s/2 = 2w cosh s/2. The spectrum of the
associated H matrix forms a band, such that the lower
edge of ̺(ǫ) is

ǫﬂoor = γ − 2w = 2w [cosh(s/2) − 1]

(51)

If we introduce a weak-link w0 ≪ w at the (0, 1) bond, we
get one exceptional diagonal element γ0. Consequently,
for small enough w0, there is an out-of-band impurity
level that does not mix with the band:

ǫ0 ≈ γ0 = w0es/2 + we−s/2

(52)

In the lower panel of Fig.5 we separate the contribution of
the impurity level from the contribution oﬀ all the other
band-levels.

VII. DISCUSSION

We have outlined a physically appealing procedure to
extract the relaxation rate of a stochastic spreading pro-
cess in a closed ring, bridging between the discrete model
and its continuum limit, and treating on equal footing full
and sparse disorder. By sparse disorder we mean several
weak-links. For presentation purposes we have provided
a full analysis for a ring with a single defect, but the
generalization to several weak links is merely a technical
issue.

Our approach has been inspired by previous works re-
grding non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [13–15], and follows
our previous publication [16] regarding the determina-
tion of the complexity threshold.
In the present work
the emphasis was on the determination of the relaxation
rate Γ in the “complex” regime where the topological as-
pect manifests itself. Generally speaking in this regime Γ
may exhibit anomalous dependence on the length of the
sample.

where U = diag{U (n)} is a diagonal matrix. The re-
lation between W and ˜W can be regarded as a gauge
transformation, and S(cid:9) can be regarded as an imaginary
Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux. The hermitian matrix H can be
regarded as the Hamiltonian of a particle in a ring in the
absence of a magnetic ﬂux. The W of a clean ring Eq.(3)
and its associated H are

In the absence of disorder the eignevalues are obtained
by the simple substitution P 7→ (2π/L)ν, where ν is an
integer.

In the presence of disorder, the forward and backward
rates are random numbers. Here we summarize known
analytical expressions for v and D based on [2], and no-
tations as in [16–18]. Taking the inﬁnite chain limit, and
using units such that the lattice spacing is a = 1, the
expression for the drift velocity is

We notice that a non-percolating resistor-network-
disorder will diminish the drift velocity as expected due
to the denominator. Irrespective of that the result above
is valid only in the “sliding regime” where v > 0. Looking
at the numerator one observes that the implied condition
for that is s > s1. As for the diﬀusion, it becomes ﬁnite
for s > s2, and the explicit expression is

Appendix C: The characteristic equation

Considering a ring with random rates we±En/2, the de-
pendence of all the various expectation values on the
aﬃnity s is expressible in terms of the parameters w and
sµ. For example

v = e

2 (s1−s1/2)(cid:20)2 sinh(cid:18) s − s1

Appendix B: The associated H matrix

Our model is described by a conservative matrix W
that describes hopping between sites. In the Chain con-
ﬁguration the site index n runs from −∞ to ∞, while in
the Ring conﬁguration it is deﬁned modulo N . In the lat-
ter case we characterize the stochastic ﬁeld by a potential
U (n) and by an aﬃnity S(cid:9), such that

En = U (n) − U (n−1) +

S(cid:9)
N

(B1)

Then we associate with W a similar matrix ˜W and a
real symmetric matrix H as follows:

W = diagonaln − γn(s)o + oﬀdiagonalnwne± En

2No
˜W = diagonaln − γn(s)o + oﬀdiagonalnwne±

Our modiﬁed indexing scheme of the elements, allows a

From here follows

det(z + W ) = det(z + ˜W )

(C3)

= det(z + H) − 2(cid:20)cosh(cid:18) S(cid:9)

2 (cid:19) − 1(cid:21) (−w)N

Hence the characteristic equation is Eq. (22).

Appendix D: The spectral density ̺(ǫ)

Consider a ring where the transition rates between
neighboring sites are random variables we±En/2. The
equation that describes the relaxation in such a ring
in the continuum limit is Eq. (7) with “white dis-
order”.
Namely v(x) has Gaussian statistics with
hv(x)v(x′)i = νσδ(x−x′) where νσ = w2a3Var(E). As-
suming D(x) = D0, and adding to the disorder an av-
erage value v0, one observes that the diﬀusion equation
is characterized by a single dimensionless parameter. It
is customary to deﬁne

µ ≡

2D0
νσ

v0 =

2s

Var(E)

This parameter equals v0 if we use the common re-scaling
of units such that 2D0 = νσ = 1. Then the units of time
and of length are

In the absence of disorder, by inspection of Eq. (B6),
the spectral density ̺(ǫ) is like that of a “free parti-
cle” but shifted upwards such that the band ﬂoor is
ǫ0 = (1/4)v2/D.
In the presence of Gaussian disorder
the gap [0, ǫ0] is ﬁlled.
In scaled units the integrated
density of states is [3]:

(D1)

(D2)

(D3)

which has a minimum at ǫ = (a + b)/2 and resembles
a “soft well” potential. In order to have a ﬂat ﬂoor the
density has to be larger at the edges. This is the case for
a charge density that corresponds to the spectrum of a
clean ring. The locations of the charges are

ǫn = 2(cid:20)cosh(cid:16) s

2(cid:17) − cos(cid:18) 2π

N

n(cid:19)(cid:21) ≡ ǫ(kn)

(E2)

and the potential along the real axis is

V (ǫ) =

N

2π Z 2π

0

ln|ǫ − ǫ(k)| dk

(E3)

For ǫ within the band, the integrand can be written as
ln|2(cos(k0)−cos(k))|, and accordingly the potential van-
ishes, reﬂecting an inﬁnite localization length.
In the continuum limit the charge density in the case
of a clean ring behaves as ̺(ǫ) ∝ ǫµ−1 with µ = 1/2 and
leads to a ﬂat ﬂoor. For general µ one can show [16] that

V ′(ǫ) ∝ πµ cot(πµ) ǫµ−1

(E4)

such that the sign of V ′(ǫ) is positive for µ < 1/2, and
negative for µ > 1/2. See Fig.2 for an illustration. We
also illustrate there what happens if we have a clean ring
that is perturbed by a defect that contributes a charge
in the gap.

For s > s∞ we have µ = ∞, meaning that a gap is
opened. If s is suﬃciently large the eigenstates of H are
“trivially localized”, so the eigenvalues are simply

N (ǫ) =

1
π2

L

µ(√2ǫ) + Y 2
J 2

µ (√2ǫ)

(D4)

ǫn = exp[(s + ςn)/2]

(E5)

where Jµ and Yµ are Bessel functions of the ﬁrst and
second kind. For any µ the large asymptotics gives

N (ǫ) ≈ (1/π)√2ǫ in agreement with the free particle re-
sult. In the other extreme, for small ǫ we get N (ǫ) ∝ ǫµ.
It is also not diﬃcult to verify that the clean ring spec-
trum (with its gap) is recovered in the σ 7→ 0 limit.
We have veriﬁed that for box-distributed En the ap-
proximation ̺(ǫ) ∝ ǫµ−1 holds at the vicinity of the band
ﬂoor. In contrast with a Gaussian distribution µ becomes
inﬁnite as s approaches s∞ = σ, see Eq. (18). For s > s∞
a gap is opened.

Appendix E: Step by step electrostatics

The eigenvalues ǫn of H can be regarded as the lo-
cations of charges in a 2D electrostatic problem. We
would like to gain some intuition for the associated po-
tential along the real axis. For a point charge at ǫ1 we
have V (ǫ) = ln|ǫ − ǫ1|. For a uniform charge distribution
within ǫ ∈ [a, b] we get
b − aZ b
[(ǫ−a) ln|ǫ−a| − (ǫ−b) ln|ǫ−b| + (a−b)]

where ςn ∈ [−σ, σ]
Ac-
cordingly the charge density is ̺(ǫ) = N/σǫ within

an interval
b = exp[(s + σ)/2], leading to

(E6)

We would like to calculate the decay rate as described
by Eq. (30). To carry out the calculation it is easier to
integrate with respect to ς. Expanding Eq. (25) in the
vicinity of the origin we get the coeﬃcients

Substitution of C1 and C2 into Eq. (30) leads to a result
