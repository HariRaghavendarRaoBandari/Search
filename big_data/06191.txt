Abstract

In this paper, we study a class of Quadratic Backward Stochastic Diﬀerential Equa-
tions (QBSDE in short) with jumps and unbounded terminal condition. We extend
the class of quadratic semimartingales introduced by Barrieu and El Karoui [4] in the
jump diﬀusion model. The properties of these class of semimartingales lead us to prove
existence result for the solution of a quadratic BSDE’s.

Keywords: Backward stochastic diﬀerential equation, quadratic semimartingales, expo-
nential inequalitie .

Introduction

Backward stochastic diﬀerential equations (in short BSDE’s) were ﬁrst introduced by Bis-
mut in 1973 [8] as equation for the adjoint process in the stochastic version of Pontryagin
maximum principle. Pardoux and Peng [46] have generalized the existence and uniqueness
result in the case when the driver is Lipschitz continuous. Since then BSDE’s have been
widely used in stochastic control and especially in mathematical ﬁnance, as any pricing
problem by replication can be written in terms of linear BSDEs, or non-linear BSDEs when
portfolios constraints are taken into account as in El Karoui, Peng and Quenez [21]. An-
other direction which has attracted many works in this area, especially in connection with
applications, is how to improve the existence/uniqueness conditions of a solution under
weaker conditions on the driver. Particularly in those papers it is assumed that f is just
continuous and satisﬁes a quadratic growth condition. Among them we can quote Koby-
lanski [34], Lepeltier and San Martin [38] and so on. All of those works are assumed that
the terminal condition is bounded and they are based on an exponential change of variable,
troncation porcedure and comparison theorem of solutions of BSDE’s. Nonetheless, note
that in general we do not have uniqueness of the solution. In [34] a uniqueness result is also

given by adding a more stronger conditions on the coeﬃcient. This latter model of BSDE’s
is very useful in mathematical ﬁnance especially when we deal with exponential utilities
or risk measure theory especially weather derivatives (see e.g. El Karoui and Rouge [22],
Mania and Schweizer [42], Hu, Imkeller and M¨uller [33], Barrieu and El Karoui [5] and
Becherer ([6], [7])). Actually it has been shown in [22] that in a market model with con-
straints on the portfolios, the indiﬀerence price is given by the resolution of a BSDE with
quadratic growth coeﬃcient. Finally let us point out that control risk-sensitive problems
turn into BSDE’s which fall in the same framework in El Karoui and Hamad`ene [23]. Our
work was also motivated by solving a utility maximization problem of terminal wealth with
exponential utility function in models involving assets with jumps. Therefore we need to
consider Backward Diﬀerential Equations with jumps of the form

Yt = ηT +Z T

t

fs(Ys, Zs, Us)ds −Z T

t

ZsdWs −Z T

U (s, x).eµ(ds, dx)

(1.1)

whereeµ is a martingale random measure. A solution of such BSDE associated with (f, ηT )

is a triple of square integrable processes (Yt, Zt, Ut)0≤t≤T . The standard BSDE’s with jumps
driven by Lipschitz coeﬃcient was ﬁrst introduced by Barles, Buckdahn and Pardoux [2] in
order to give a probabilistic interpretation of viscosity solution of semilinear integral-Partial
equations. Afterwards the case of BSDE’s with jumps and quadratic coeﬃcient was studied
by Becherer [7] and Morlais [45] in the context of exponential utility maximization problem
in model involving jumps. In the both papers ([7], [45]), the authors have used in the case of
bounded terminal condition the Kobylanski method in the jump setting. As a consequence,
they obtain that the state process Y and the jump components U of the BSDE solution are
uniformly bounded, and that the martingale component is a BMO-martingale. Moreover,
the so-called Kobylanski method is based on analytical point view inspired from Boccardo,
Murat and Puel paper [10] and it is based on the exponential change of variables, troncation
procedure and stability theorem. Therefore, one of the main diﬃculty in this method is
the proof of the strong convergence in the martingale part approximation. More recently
Tevzadze [43] proposed a new diﬀerent method to get the existence and uniquness of the
solution of quadratic BSDE’s. The method is based on a ﬁxed point theorem but for only
bounded terminal condition with small L∞-norm.
Our main task in this paper is to deal with quadratic BSDE’s with non-bounded terminal
valued and jumps. Our point of view is inspired from Barrieu and El Karoui [4] for their
study in the continuous case. By adopting a forward point of view, se shall characterize ﬁrst
a solution of BSDE’s as a quadratic Itˆo semimartingale Y , with a decomposition satisfying
the quadratic exponential structure condition qexp(l, c, δ), where the term exponential refers
to the exponential feature of the jump coeﬃcient which appears in the generator of the
BSDE. More precisely, we assume that: there exists nonnegative processes constants c , δ
and l such

where jt(u) =RE(eu(x) −u(x)−1)ξ(t, x)λ(dx). The canonical structure qexp(0, 0, δ) will play

condition. The simplest generator of a quadratic exponential BSDE, called the canonical
generator, is deﬁned as f (t, y, z, u) = qδ(z, u) = δ
δ j(δu). For a given random variable
ψT , we call entropic process, the process deﬁned as ρδ,t(ηT ) = 1
a solution of the canonical BSDE’s associated to the coeﬃcient qδ and ﬁnal condition ψT .
This is a entropic dynamic risk measure which have been studied, by Barrieu and El Karoui
in [5]. The backward point of view of our approach permits to relate the quadratic BSDEs
to a quadratic exponential semimartingale with structure condition qexp(l, a, δ), using the
entropic processes. Namely, a semimartingale X with non bounded terminal condition ηT
and satisfying the structure condition qexp(l, a, δ), yields the following dominated inequal-
ities ρ−δ,t(U T ) ≤ Yt ≤ ρδ,t(U T ), where U T and U T are two random variable depending
only on l, a, δ and ηT . In the continuous seeting, Briand and Hu [11] prove implicitly the
entropy inequalities in the proof of the existence of the solution of a quadratic BSDE, using
Kobylanski method and localization procedure.
The main goal in our approach is then to deduce, from this dominated inequalities, a
structure properties on the martingale part and the ﬁnite variation part of X. Indeed, we
obtain the canonical decomposition of an entropic quasimartingale which is a semimartin-
gale which satisﬁes the entropy inequalities; as a canonical quadratic semimartingale part
plus an predictable increasing process. This Doob type decomposition help us to deﬁne a
general quadratic exponential semimartingale as a limit of a sequence of canonical quadratic
semimartingale plus a sequence of an increasing process. Then, from the stability theorem
for forward semimartingales given by Barlow and Protter [3], we prove the existence of the
solution of a quadratic exponential BSDE associated to (f, ηT ) for a coeﬃcient f satisfying
the structure condition qexp(l, a, δ) and for non-bounded terminal condition ηT . Finally, we
have to mention that it is important to compare our approach with that used by Peng in
[47, 49, 50] within the representation theorem of small g-expectation in terms of a BSDE’s
with coeﬃcient g which admits a linear growth condition in z. Peng’s approach is based
on the notion of martingale associated to a nonlinear expectation, Monotonic limit theo-
rem, a nonlinear Doob-Meyer’s decomposition Theorem (see e.g.
[48]). Moreover, Peng
obtained the representation theorem for the nonlinear expectation which is dominated by
a structure nonlinear expectation solution of BSDE’s with coeﬃcient given specially by

gµ(y, z) = µ(cid:0)|y| + |z|(cid:1). Barrieu and El Karoui in [5] have extended this representation

theorem for a dynamic convex risk measure in terms of quadratic BSDE’s with convex
coeﬃcient g which depends only in z. Our approach is an extension of the Peng’s results
in the more naturel framework of quadratic exponential semimartingale.

The paper is structured as follows: in a second section, we give a model and preliminary
notation. In the third section, we deﬁne the quadratic exponential semimartingale and we
study the entropic quadratic exponential semimartingale. In particular, we give the char-
acterization of an entropic quasimartingale and its Doob decomposition. Then, a stability
results of this class of semimartingale are given in the fourth section. The ﬁfth section is
dedicated to give application of the quadratic exponential semimartingale to prove exis-
tence result for a class of QBSDE’s associated to (f, ηT ) where the coeﬃcient f satisﬁes
the structure condition q(l, a, δ) and for non-bounded terminal condition ηT .

2 Model and Preliminaries

This section sets out the notations and the assumptions that are supposed in the sequel. We
start with a stochastic basis (Ω, F , F, P) with ﬁnite horizon time T < +∞ and a ﬁltration

F = (cid:0)Ft(cid:1)t∈[0,T ] satisfying the usual conditions of right continuity and completness such

that we can take all semimartingales to have right continuous paths with left limits. For
simplicity, we assume F0 is trivial and F = FT . Without losing any generality we shall
work with a random measure to characterize the jumps of any quasi-left continuous process
X. Let (E, E) a measurable space, let deﬁne on the stochastic basis, a random measure left
continuous µ(ω, dt × dx) on (Ω, F) in ([0, T ] × E, B([0, T ]) × E):

µX(ω, dt, dx) =Xs>0

1{∆Xs(ω)6=0}ε(s,Xs(ω))(dt, dx).

where εa is the Dirac measure on a. Moreover the dual predictable projection ν X of µX
exists and it is called L´evy system of X (see Yor [52] for more details). For simplicity we note

µ = µX and ν = ν X. Deﬁne the measure P⊗ν on (eΩ, eF ) = (Ω×[0, T ]×E, F ⊗B([0, T ])⊗E)

by:

1 eB(ω, t, e)ν(ω, dt, de)# ,

P ⊗ ν(eB) = E"Z[0,T ]×E
y(w, s, x)µ(w, ds, dx), and y.νt =Z t
y.µt =Z t
0 ZE
0 ZE

Let P denote the predicatble σ-ﬁeld on Ω×[0, T ] and deﬁne eP = P⊗E, for any eP-measurable

function y with values in R; we deﬁne:

eB ∈ eF .

y(w, s, x)ν(w, ds, dx).

Let denote by Gloc(µ), the set of eP- measurable functions H with values in R such that
Moreover if |H|.νt < +∞ a.s, H.eµ := H.(µ − ν) = H.µ − H.ν is a local martingale and we

assume the following representation theorem for any local martingale M :

|H|2.νt < ∞,

a.s.

M = M0 + M c + M d.

where M c is the continuous part of the martingale and M d is the discontinuous part, more-
over there exists U ∈ Gloc(µ) such that M d = U.(µ − ν).

We ﬁrst introduce the following notations:

0 is the set of martingale M such that M0 = 0 and E(cid:2)supt≤T |Mt|p(cid:3) < +∞.

Mp
Dexp is the set of local semimartingales X such that exp(X) ∈ D where D (see [13], [14] for
the deﬁnition)
Uexp is the set of local martingales M such that E(M ) is uniformly integrable.

3 Quadratic exponential semimartingales

In all our work, we shall consider the class of quasi-left continuous semimartingales X with
canonical decomposition X = X0 − V + M , with V is a continuous predictable process
with ﬁnite total variation |V |, M is a c`adl`ag local martingale satisfying the decomposition

M = M c + M d with M c is the continuous part of the martingale M and M d = U.eµ for some

U ∈ Gloc(µ) is the purely discontinuous part . The quadratic exponential semimartingales
are the generalization of the quadratic semimartingales in jump diﬀusion models. The extra
term in ” exponential” comes from jumps and lead us to generalize the results given by [4].

Deﬁnition 3.1. The process X is a local quadratic exponential semimartingale if there
exists two positive continuous increasing processes Λ and C and a positive constant δ such

that the processes δM c + (eδU − 1).eµ, −δM c + (e−δU − 1).eµ are still local martingales and

the the ﬁnite variation of X satisﬁes the structure condition Q(Λ, C, δ):

process.

Remark 3.1. (About the dual predictable compensator)

– Before studying the properties of this class of local semimartingale, let ﬁrst remark that
for all γ ∈ {−δ, δ}, the increasing c`adl`ag process j(γ∆M ) is continuous applying Chap
IV T[40] Dellacherie[13]. Moreover using representation theorem of the discontinuous

martingale M d = U.eµ, then:

jt(γ∆M d

t ) = (eγU − γU − 1).νt.

– Let remark that for a = e∆U − 1 , b = e−∆U − 1 since −2ab ≤ a2 + b2, we ﬁnd

2[(eδU − δU − 1) + (e−δU + δU − 1)] ≤ |eδU − 1|2 + |e−δU − 1|2

Since by assumption the processes δM c + (eδU − 1)eµ, −δM c + (e−δU − 1)eµ are local

martingales, the processes |eδU − 1|2.νt a.s and |e−δU − 1|2.νt < +∞ a.s, therefore the
predictable compensator j(γ∆M d) of Aγ is well deﬁned for γ ∈ {−δ, δ}.

To understand better the class of local quadratic exponential semimartingales and theirs
properties, we divide the class in three classes:

– The ﬁrst class (The canonical class), where the ﬁnite variation part of X satisﬁes:

3.1 The canonical class

3.1.1 The exponential of Dol´eans-Dade

We describe the relation between the exponential transform of a ﬁrst class of local quadratic
exponential semimartingale and the exponential of Dol´eans-Dade . Let ﬁrst recall that for
any c`adl`ag local semimartingale X, the exponential of Dol´eans-Dade Z of X solving the
EDS dZt = Zt− dXt, Z0 = 1 is given by:

Zt = E(Xt) = exp(Xt − hX cit)Ys≤t

(1 + ∆Xs)e−∆Xs ,

t ≥ 0.

(3.3)

This formula is given by the Ito’s formula for discontinuous processes see Appendix (Theo-
rem 6.8, Corollary 6.1) and Yor [52] for more details. We deduce that for a local martingale
M , such that ∆M > −1, the exponential of M is a positive local martingale and there
is some relation between exponential of a canonical quadratic exponential semimartingale
and Dol´eans-Dade of some local martingale.

Proposition 3.1. ( Dol´eans Dade martingale and canonical quadratic semimartingale).

quadratic exponential semimartingale:

r( ¯M ) = r( ¯M0) + ¯Mt −

r(M ) = r(M 0) + M t +

then we ﬁnd the following processes:

Proof. We apply the Dol´eans-Dade exponential formula (3.3) with ¯X = ¯M c + (e

and X = −M c + (e−U − 1).eµ. and we ﬁnd the expected results.

Deﬁnition 3.2. (Q- local martingale) A local semimartingale X is a Q-local martingale if
exp(X) is a positive local martingale.

The canonical local quadratic exponential semimartingales ¯r( ¯M ) and −r(M ) deﬁned

above are Q- local martingales.

3.1.2 The entropic risk measure

The canonical local quadratic exponential semimartingales ¯r( ¯M ) and r(M ) are Q- local
martingales, we can ﬁnd more conditions on the local martingales ¯M and M to get the
uniform integrability condition of these semimartingales. Let ﬁrst denote by Uexp the set
of local martingales M such that E(M ) is uniformly integrable and Dexp the set of local
semimartingale such that exp(X) ∈ D. The suﬃcient condition that a local martingale

M = M c + U.eµ belongs to Uexp is given in Lepingle and M´emin [?] Theorem IV.3:

hM ciτ + ((1 + U ) ln(1 + U ) − U ) .ντ }(cid:21) < +∞.

E(cid:20)exp{

(3.4)

where τ = inf{t ≥ 0, E(M ) = 0}. This condition is suﬃcient and not necessary, another
suﬃcient condition for a local semimartingale X to belong to Dexp is satisfying if there
exists a positive uniformly integrable martingale M such that exp(X) ≤ M . In particular
theses suﬃcient conditions are satisfying for the dynamic entropic risk measure (see Barrieu
and El Karoui for more details[5]).

Proposition 3.2. Let consider the ﬁxed horizon time T > 0 and ψT ∈ FT such that
exp(|ψT |) ∈ L1 and consider the two dynamic risk measures:

¯ρt(ψT ) = ln [E (exp(ψT )|Ft)] , and ρ

(ψT ) = − ln [E (exp(−ψT )|Ft)]

that exp(¯ρt(ψT )) = E( ¯Xt). Using martingale representation Theorem there exists a continu-
ous martingale M c and a process U satisfying eU −1 ∈ Gloc(µ) such that ¯X = ¯M c+(e

guments to prove that there exists a martingale X = −M c + (e−U − 1).eµ ∈ Uexp such that

(ψT )) = E(−M c

We adopt a forward and backward points of view to describe the canonical local quadratic
exponential semimartingales class. In the forward point of view, we give condition of some
martingales using Dol´eans-Dade exponential formula to ﬁnd that for any canonical local
quadratic exponential semimartingale X, exp(X) or exp(−X) is a local martingale. In the
backward point of view, we ﬁx a terminal condition XT ∈ FT such that exp(|XT |) ∈ L1,
then we can prove that some dynamic entropic risk measures of ψT belongs to canonical

In this point of view, we do not make as-
sumption on the martingale part of the canonical semimartingale to satisfy the Lepingle
and M´emin condition (3.4) since the exponential condition on the terminal condition is
suﬃcient to ﬁnd uniform integrability condition.

3.2 The second class: Q(0, 0, 1)

3.2.1 The exponential transform

In the ﬁrst part, we use the Dol´eans-Dade formula to explain how the canonical local
quadratic exponential semimartingale can be represented using an exponential transform.
The same technics can be developped for Q(0, 0, 1)- local semimartingale using the multi-
plicative decomposition Theorem studied by Meyer and Yoeurp [44]) which stands that for
any c`adl`ag positive local submartingale Z there exists an predictable increasing process A
(A0 = 0) and a local martingale M (∆M > −1, M0 = 0) such that:

Zt = Z0 exp(At).E(Mt),

t ≥ 0.

Theorem 3.1. Let X a l`adl`ag process, X is a Q(0, 0, 1)-local semimartingale if and only
if exp(X) and exp(−X) are local submartingales. In both cases, X is a c`adl`ag process.

Proof. Let consider a Q(0, 0, 1)- local semimartingale X with canonical decomposition X =
X0 − V + M where V is the ﬁnite variation part of X (continuous) and M is a local

formula, we ﬁnd the decomposition of ¯Z = exp(X):

martingale, then there exists U ∈ Gloc(µ) such that M = M c + U.eµ. Applying Ito’ s

Since X is a Q(0, 0, 1)- semimartingale then A = −V + 1
2 hM ci+(eU −U −1).ν is an increasing
continuous predictable process. Therefore the process Z = exp(X) is a positive local
submartingale and satisﬁes the following Meyer and Yoeurp multiplicative decomposition:

exp(Xt − X0) = exp(At)E(M c

t ≥ 0.

t + (eU − 1).eµt),

We use the same arguments to prove that exp(−X) is a local positive submartingale. Let
now assume that exp(X) and exp(−X) are local submartingales where X is a l`adl`ag process.
Using Meyer and Yoeurp multiplicative decomposition, there exist local martingales ¯M , M
and increasing predictable processes ¯A, A such that exp(Xt − X0) = exp( ¯At)E( ¯Mt) and
exp(−Xt +X0) = exp(At)E(M t). Using the representation martingale Theorem, there exist
¯U , U ∈ Gloc(µ) and continuous local martingales ¯M c, M c such that ¯M = ¯M c +(e

¯U −1).eµ and
M = M c +(eU −1).eµ. Hence we ﬁnd exp(X −X0) = exp( ¯A) exp(r( ¯M ) and exp(−X +X0) =
hM ci−(eU −U −1).eνt.

Using the uniqueness of the representation of the semimartingale X, we deduce, M = − ¯M ,
¯U − ¯U − 1).νt + (e− ¯U + ¯U − 1).νt . The process ¯A and A

Since 0 ≤ αt ≤ 2, the local semimartingale X satisﬁes the structure condition Q(0, 0, 1).
Moreover the ﬁnite variation part V of X is a predictable continuous process. We deduce X
is Q(0, 0, 1)- local semimartingale and that all jumps of X come from the local martingale
part which is c`adl`ag process.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let consider a local semimartingale X, if exp(X) is a local submartingale
then X is called Q- local submartingale.

From Theorem 3.1, any Q(0, 0, 1)- local semimartingale is a Q- local submartingale and

the reverse holds true.

3.2.2 The entropic submartingales

We are interested to ﬁnd uniform integrability condition for Q(0, 0, 1)- local semimartin-
gales. Since Q(0, 0, 1)- local semimartingales are Q- local submartingales, we use the same
technics developped for standard local submartingales. We recall that to prove X ∈ Dexp,
it is suﬃcient to prove there exists a positive martingale L ∈ D such that exp(X) ≤ L. To
construct the positiive martingale L, let ﬁrst give some useful deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 3.4. A process X ∈ Dexp is called an entropic submartingale if for any stopping
times σ ≤ τ :

Xσ ≤ ¯ρσ(Xτ ),

σ ≤ τ.

where ¯ρ stands for the usual entropic risk measure deﬁned above. In the same point of view,
X is called a entropic supermartingale if −X is an entropic submartingale. If X and −X
are entropic submartingales, X is called entropic quasi-martingale.

Theorem 3.2. Let T > 0 the ﬁxed horizon time and consider a semimartingale X =

if and only if X and −X are entropic submartingales.Moreover, in all cases the martingales

X0 − V + M c + U.eµ such that exp(|XT |) ∈ L1 then X is a Q(0, 0, 1)-semimartingale ∈ Dexp
M c + (eU − 1).eµ and −M c + (e−U − 1).eµ belong to Uexp.
Proof. Let consider a Q(0, 0, 1)-semimartingale X = X0 + M c + U.eµ − V ∈ Dexp such that

exp(|XT |) ∈ L1. Since X is Q- submartingale we ﬁnd:

exp(Xt) ≤ E [exp(XT )|Ft] ∈ D and exp(−Xt) ≤ E [exp(−XT )|Ft] ∈ D

and for any stopping times: σ ≤ τ ≤ T :

Xσ ≤ ln (E [exp(Xτ )|Fσ]) = ¯ρσ(Xτ ) and − Xσ ≤ ln (E [exp(−Xτ )|Fσ]) = ¯ρσ(−Xτ ).

then X and −X are entropic submartingales. Let prove the reverse, assume X and −X
are entropic submartingales then for any stopping times σ ≤ τ , exp(Xσ)) ≤ E [exp(Xτ )|Fσ]

9

and exp(−Xσ)) ≤ E [exp(−Xτ )|Fσ], then X is a uniformly integrable Q-submartingale and
from Theorem 3.1, X is a Q(0, 0, 1)-semimartingale. Since X and −X belong to Dexp then
for a ﬁxed horizon time T , exp(XT ) and exp(−XT ) belong to L1 which lead to conclude
exp(|XT |) ∈ L1. Moreover since X and −X are Q-submartingales using Meyer-Yoeurp
multiplicative decomposition Theorem, there exist increasing processes ¯A and A ( ¯A0 = 0
and A0 = 0)) such that:

exp(Xt−X0) = exp( ¯At)E(M c

Therefore we deduce that E(M c

t +(e−U −1).eµt).
t + (e−U − 1).eµ) ≤
exp(−Xt + X0). Since |X − X0| ∈ Dexp, we conclude the martingales M c + (eU − 1).eµ and
−M c + (e−U − 1).eµ ∈ Uexp.

t +(eU −1).eµt) and exp(−Xt+X0) = exp(At)E(−M c
t + (eU − 1).eµ) ≤ exp(Xt − X0) and E(−M c

To conclude this part, we can make some links with the sublinear g-expectation of Peng
[51] since if we deﬁne the g-expectation of X by Eg(X), we can deﬁne the submartingale
under the g-expectation. Therefore, we deduce that if X is Q(0, 0, 1)-semimartingale such
that |X| ∈ Dexp, X and −X are submartingales under Eg = ln [E(exp)].

3.3 General class:Q(δ, Λ, C)

3.3.1 The exponential transform

We use some exponential transformations for general Q(Λ, C, δ) local quadratic exponential
semimartingale such that the new tansformed process belong to the class Q(0, 0, 1). There-
fore, we can apply the same methodology using in the previous sections to ﬁnd general
results for Q(Λ, C, δ) local semimartingales.

Proposition 3.3. Let consider a Q(Λ, C, δ)-local semimartingale X = X0 − V + M c + U.eµ

then

1. For any λ 6= 0, the process λX is a Q(Λ, C, δ

|λ| )-local semimartingale and a Q(λΛ, C, δ)-

local semimartingale when λ > 1.

2. Let deﬁne the two transformations:

Y Λ,C(X) = X + Λ + |X| ∗ C and ¯Y Λ,C(|X|) = eC|X| + eC ∗ Λ.

then the two processes Y Λ,C(δX) and ¯Y Λ,C(|δX|) are Q-local submartingales.

3. Exponential transformation: Let U Λ,C(X) the transformation

Q-local submartingale. Let prove now the process ¯Y Λ,C(|X|) belong to the Q(0, 0, 1)-
class, let applying the Meyer-Ito’s formula, we ﬁnd the decomposition:

2. Let consider the Y Λ,C(δX) = δX0+fMt−eVt, wherefM is the local martingale part given
by fM = δM c + δM d and eV the ﬁnite variation part given by eV = δV − Λ − |δX| ∗ C
. Since X is Q(Λ, C, δ)-local semimartingale we have deVt << djt(δ∆M d) + δ2

Since the process X is a Q(Λ, C, δ)-local semimartingale, the process A deﬁned by

Since |y + u| − |y| ≥ sign(y)u we deduce eA is increasing then we get:

Therefore, exp( ¯X Λ,C) is a local submartingale then it is Q-local submartingale.

Theorem 3.3. Let X a l`adl`ag optionnal process X. X is a Q(Λ, C, δ)-local semimartingale

if and only if exp(cid:2)Y Λ,C(δX)(cid:3) and exp(cid:2)Y Λ,C(−δX)(cid:3) are submartingales or equivently if the

processes U Λ,C(eδX ) and U Λ,C(e−δX ) are local submartingales. In all cases; X is a c`adl`ag
process.

Proof. Let consider a Q(Λ, C, δ)-local semimartingale X, using Proposition 3.3-2), we
prove the process exp(Y Λ,C(δX)) is a local submartingale. The same arguments lead us
to conclude also that exp(Y Λ,C(−δX)) is a local submartingale since −X as the same
structure condition as X. Let now consider that the both processes exp(Y Λ,C(δX)) and
exp(Y Λ,C(−δX)) are positive submartingales then we can apply the Yoeurp-Meyer decom-
position as Theorem 3.1 and conclude there exists continuous local martingales ¯M c, M c,

then X is a Q(Λ, C, δ)- local semimartingale. equivalently, we can use the same arguments
for the positive local submartingale U Λ,C(eδX ) and U Λ,C(eδX ) to ﬁnd that the process

X is a Q(Λ, C, δ)-local semimartingale. Moreover since the ﬁnite variation part of eV is

continuous, jumps come from the local martingale part. Hence, the process X is a c`adl`ag
local semimartingale.

In all the rest of the paper, since from a multiplicative transformation (see Proposition
3.3), we can transform the general class Q(Λ, C, δ) to the class Q(Λ, C, 1). We can give all
results in the class Q(Λ, C) := Q(Λ, C, 1) without losing any generality.

3.3.2 Uniform Integrable Q(Λ, C)- semimartingales

We use the entropic submartingales to characterize the integrability condition for Q(0, 0, 1)-
class. Given an ﬁxed horizon time, we ﬁnd in this part suﬃcient condition on the terminal
condition to have uniform integrability of general local quadratic exponential semimartin-
gales. First, let give some generalization of entropic submartingales for general Q(Λ, C)-
semimartingales.

Theorem 3.4. let X be a c`adl`ag process and T a ﬁxed horizon time.

1. Assuming, exp(|XT |) ∈ L1, the process X is a Q(Λ, C)-semimartingale which belongs

to Dexp if and only if for any stopping times σ ≤ τ ≤ T :

Xσ ≤ ρσ(Xτ + Λσ,τ + |X| ∗ Cσ,τ ) and − Xσ ≤ ρσ(−Xτ + Λσ,τ + |X| ∗ Cσ,τ ).

(3.5)

2. Assuming U Λ,C

T

(e|X|) ∈ L1, the process X is a Q(Λ, C)-semimartingale which belongs

to Dexp if and only if for any stopping times σ ≤ τ ≤ T :

Xσ ≤ ρσ(Xτ + Λσ,τ + |X| ∗ Cσ,τ ) and − Xσ ≤ ρσ(−Xτ + Λσ,τ + |X| ∗ Cσ,τ ).

13

Proof.

1. Let X a Q(Λ, C)-semimartingales which belongs to the class Dexp. From
Theeorem 3.3, exp(Y Λ,C(X)) and exp(Y Λ,C(−X)) are submartingales which belong
to the class D. Therefore for any stopping times σ ≤ τ ≤ T :

exp(Y Λ,C

σ

(X) ≤ E(cid:2)exp(Y Λ,C

τ

(X)|Fσ(cid:3) and exp(Y Λ,C

σ

(−X) ≤ E(cid:2)exp(Y Λ,C

τ

(−X)|Fσ(cid:3)

then the Q(Λ, C) semimartingale X satisﬁes the entropy inequalities (3.5). Let assume
the inequalities (3.5) are satiﬁed then we conclude exp(Y Λ,C(X)) and exp(Y Λ,C(−X))
are submartingales which belong to the class D then from Theorem 3.3, X is a Q(Λ, C)
semimartingales which belong to the class Dexp.

2. We use the same arguments with the positive submartingales U Λ,C(eX ) and U Λ,C(e−X ).

The Theorem 3.4 gives suﬃcient integrable condition for Q(Λ, C)-semimartingale X
such that it belongs to the class Dexp. We can ﬁnd another condition using the transfor-
mation ¯Y Λ,C(|X|) since it is a Q-submartingale. Therefore, using the same arguments as
assertions in Theorem 3.4, we ﬁnd ¯Y Λ,C(|Xt|) ≤ ¯ρt[exp( ¯Y Λ,C(|XT |)] which is equivalent to
the condition given by [4] in the continuous case (see Hypotehsis 2.8 [4]):

|Xt| ≤ ρt(cid:20)eCt,T |YT | +Z T

t

eCt,s dΛs(cid:21) ,

t ≤ T.

(3.6)

This assumption is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the process ¯Y Λ,C(|X|) to be in
class Dexp (the proof is given in Lemma 2.9 of [4]). In the same way, assertions in Proposition
2.10 of [4] still hold since the authors give the result in the general case (without using the
continuity of processes). Moreover using the same LLogL Doob-inequality, we can ﬁnd the
same suﬃcient condition on the terminal value ¯Y Λ,C(|X|) such that |X| ∈ Dexp.

Proposition 3.4. Let consider an ﬁxed horizon time T > 0 and let L be a positive sub-
martingale such that max LT := maxt∈[0,T ] Lt ∈ (1, +∞). For any m > 0, let um the convex
function deﬁned on R+ deﬁned by um(x) = x−m−m ln(x) and u(x) := u1(x), the following
assertions are satisﬁed:

1. Using the Dol´eans Dade representation of positive martingale L, Lt = E(M c

t + (eU −

1).eµ), t ≤ T , we ﬁnd:

H ent := E[LT ln(LT )] = E(cid:20)LT(cid:18) 1

2

hM ciT + (U eU − eU + 1).νT(cid:19)(cid:21) .

2. The following sharp inequality holds true:

u(E(max LT )) ≤ E (LT ln(LT )) .

Moreover, if L is a positive D-submartingale, the previous inequality becomes:

um(E(max LT )) − um(L0) ≤ E[LT ln(LT )] − E(LT ) ln [E(LT )] .

where m = E(LT ).

14

Proof. :

1. To prove the assertion, let us ﬁrst prove that the equality

E(max LT ) − 1 = E [LT ln(max LT )]

Ls

max Ls

holds true in our case. From Dellacherie [15] p.375, max Lt(ω) = Lt(ω) for every
jump time t or every increasing of right of s −→ max Ls(ω). Therefore L = max L
0 d max Ls =
d max Ls then E(max LT ) − 1 = E [LT ln(max LT )] . holds true. From this
0
equality, it is suﬃcient that max LT ∈ L1 to ﬁnd LT ln(LT ) ∈ L1. Let assume,
max LT ∈ L1 and let deﬁne the stopping times TK such that the positive local mar-

on the right support of d max L. Therefore we ﬁnd max Lt = 1 +R t
R t
tingale Lt = E(Mt + (eU − 1)eµt) ≤ K. The stopping times TK is increasing and goes
to inﬁnity with K. Let deﬁne the process N Q = M c − hM ci + U.(eµ − (eU − 1).ν). is

Since E(LT ∧TK N Q

2

hM ciT ∧TK + U (eU − 1).νT ∧TK + (eU − U − 1).νT ∧TK(cid:19)(cid:21)

We have E [LT ∧TK ln(LT ∧TK )] ≤ E [LT ∧TK ln(max LT ∧TK )] ≤ E [max LT ] − 1 ≤ +∞,
then we get the result by taking the limit when K goes to inﬁnity.

2. The proof is done in [4], since authors used the ﬁrst assertion to prove the result.

Let X be a Q(Λ, C)-semimartingale, applying the result of Proposition 3.4 to the pos-

itive submartingale exp( ¯Y Λ,C(|X|)), we conclude if E(cid:16) ¯Y Λ,C
then we have max E(cid:16) ¯Y Λ,C

(|X|)](cid:17) ∈ L1
(|X|)](cid:17) ∈ L1 and the inequality (3.6) is satisﬁed,

therefore ¯Y Λ,C(|X|) belongs to class Dexp. To conclude this part, let recall the deﬁnition

4 Quadratic-exponential variation and stability result

4.1 A priori estimates

We now focus on the estimate of the martingale part of a semimartingale X ∈ SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C).
The estimates of the discontinuous martingales part allow us to conclude the predictable
projection j(γ∆M d), γ ∈ {−1, 1} is well deﬁned when the semimartingale X lives in a
suitable space.

Proposition 4.5. Let consider a semimartingale X ∈ SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) which follows the de-
composition X = X0 − V + M c + M d, where there exists a process U ∈ Gloc(µ) such that

M d = U.eµ then the matingales ¯M = M c + (eU − 1).eµ and M = −M c + (e−U − 1).eµ belong

to Uexp and Mp

0 for any p ≥ 1.

Moreover if for any stopping times σ ≤ T there exists a constant c > 0 such that

E(cid:20)exp(eCT |ηT | +Z T

0

eCs dΛs)|Fσ(cid:21) ≤ c,

then the processes ¯M and M are BMO martingales.

Proof.

1. Let X ∈ SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C), from Proposition 3.3, Y Λ,C(X) = X + Λ + |X| ∗ C and
Y Λ,C(−X) are Q-local submartingale. Moreover let recall the process ¯Y Λ,C(X) =
eC .|X| + eC ∗ Λ satisﬁes Y Λ,C(X) ≤ ¯Y Λ,C(X) and Y Λ,C(−X) ≤ ¯Y Λ,C(X), therefore
since X ∈ SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C), for any p ≥ 1, we ﬁnd:

exp(p|Y Λ,C

(|X|)|) ≤ exp[p ¯Y Λ,C

t

(X)] ≤ E(cid:20)exp[p(eCT |ηT | +Z T

We conclude:

E"sup

exp(p|Y Λ,C

(|X|)|)# < +∞.

(4.8)

From the submartingale property of exp(Y Λ,C(X)) and exp(Y Λ,C(−X)), from Yoeurp-
Meyer decomposition, there exist increasing processes ¯A and A such that:

¯Kt := exp(Y Λ,C
Kt := exp(Y Λ,C

t

t

(X)) = exp(X0)E( ¯Mt) exp( ¯At)

(−X)) = exp(−X0)E(M t) exp(At)

Since ¯A and A are increasing, from (4.8) we conclude ¯Z := E( ¯M ) and Z := E(M ) are
uniformly integrable then ¯M and M ∈ Uexp. Moreover ¯Z and Z belong to Mp, for any

Kt− [dAt + dM t], that leads to d[ ¯K]t = ¯K 2

submartingales ¯K 2 and K 2:

d ¯K 2
dK 2

t = 2 ¯Kt− d ¯Kt + d[ ¯K]t = 2 ¯K 2
t = 2K t− dK t + d[K]t = 2K 2

t− [d ¯Mt + d ¯At] + d[ ¯K]t
t−[dM t + dAt] + d[K]t

Therefore for any stopping times σ ≤ T , we ﬁnd:

E(cid:2)[ ¯K]σ,T |Fσ(cid:3) ≤ E(cid:2) ¯K 2

T |Fσ(cid:3)

and

E [[K]σ,T |Fσ] ≤ E(cid:2)K2

T |Fσ(cid:3)

Since sup0≤t≤T
Neveu Lemma (see [4] Lemma 3.3) we get:

¯Kt and sup0≤t≤T K t belong to Lp, for any p ≥ 1, from Garsia and

(4.10)

E(cid:2)[ ¯K]T ]p(cid:3) < +∞ and E [[K]T ]p] < +∞,

∀p ≥ 1

(4.11)

Since sup0≤t≤T
4.9 we conclude using Cauchy Schwartz inequalities that for any p ≥ 1:

and sup0≤t≤T

belong to Lp for any p ≥ 1 and using 4.11, from

E(cid:20)exp(eCT |ηT | +Z T

T(cid:3) ≤ +∞

0

then from 4.7 the processes ¯K and K are bounded, using 4.9 and 4.10 we conclude
the martingales ¯M and M are BMO-martingales.

4.2 Stability results of quadratic exponential semimartingale

Here, we present stability results for quadratic exponential semimartingales which we shall
use for the construction of the maximal solution of a class of quadratic BSDE’s with jumps.
We ﬁrst recall a general stability theorem of Barlow and Protter [3] for a sequence of c`adl`ag
special semimartingales converging uniformly in L1. We denote by X ∗ := sup0≤t≤T |Xt|.
Theorem 4.5. Let X n be a sequence of special semimartingales which belongs to H1 with
canonical decomposition X n = X n

0 + M n − V n, and satisﬁes:

for some positive constant C. Assume that:

0

|dV n

s |i ≤ C,

EhZ T
E(cid:2)(cid:0)X n − X(cid:1)∗(cid:3) −→ 0,
EhZ T

|dVs|i ≤ C,

0

where X is an adapted process, then X is a semimartingale in H1 with canonical decompo-
sition X = X0 + M − V satisfying:

and E(cid:2)(cid:0)M n(cid:1)∗(cid:3) ≤ C

as n → ∞,

and E(cid:2)(cid:0)M(cid:1)∗(cid:3) ≤ C

17

(4.12)

(4.13)

and we have

lim
n→∞

E(cid:2)(cid:0)V n − V(cid:1)∗(cid:3) = 0 and

lim
n→∞

kM n − M kH1 = 0.

(4.14)

Lemma 4.1. Let X n a sequence of SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) semimartingales which canonical decom-
0 − V n + M n which converge in H1 to some process X. Therefore the
position X n = X n
process X which canonical decomposition X = X0 − V + M is an adapted c`adl`ag process
which belongs to SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) such that:

lim
n→∞

E(cid:2)(cid:0)V n − V(cid:1)∗(cid:3) = 0

and

lim
n→∞

kM n − M kH1 = 0.

Proof. Let consider X n = X n
martingales. Firstly let prove that if the sequence X n converge to the process X then this
limit belongs to the space SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C). The sequence X n ∈ SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C), hence for each
n ∈ N and for any stopping times σ ≤ T :

0 − V n + (M c)n + U n.eµ a sequence of SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) semi-

− ¯ρσ(−ηT + Λσ,T + |X n| ∗ Cσ,T ) ≤ X n

σ ≤ ¯ρσ(ηT + Λσ,T + |X n| ∗ Cσ,T ),

a.s

(4.15)

and we get also:

|X n

σ | ≤ ¯ρσ(cid:20)eCσ,T |ηT | +Z T

σ

eCσ,sdΛs(cid:21) ,

a.s

(4.16)

Since the sequence X n converges in H1, we can extract a subsequence which converges
uniformly almost surely to the limit X, using the dominated convergence and taking the
limit of this subsequence in 4.15 and 4.16, we conclude the limit X belongs to the space
SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C). Since the limit X is a Q(Λ, C)-semimartingale, from Theorem 3.3 the
process X is c`adl`ag. Let now prove the convergence of the martingale part and ﬁnite
variation part, the priori estimates of their limits. From the ﬁrst assertion of Proposition
4.5, there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that:

E(cid:20)Z T

0

|dV n

s |(cid:21) ≤ E(cid:20)Z T

0

1
2

dh(M c)nis +ZE

[g(U n(s, x)) + g(−U n(s, x))]ν(ds, dx)(cid:21) ≤ C1.

Moreover From the second assertion of Proposition 4.5, using BDG inequalities, there exists
constants c2 and C2 > 0 such that:

E(cid:2)(cid:0)M(cid:1)∗

T(cid:3) ≤ c2E(cid:20)hM ni

2

T(cid:21) ≤ C2.

Therefore assuming the sequence X n converges to a process X which canonical decompo-
sition X = X0 − V + M , taking C = max(C1, C2), from Barlow and Protter Theorem 4.5,
we get the expected result.

5 Application of quadratic exponential semimartingales: quadratic

BSDEs with jumps

In stochastic optimization problem with exponential utility (see [7], [45]), or robust op-
timization with entropy penality see([9], [30]), using dynamic programing , the authors

18

solved the problem using quadratic Backward Stochastic Diﬀerential Equations (BSDE)
with bounded terminal condition in most of these papers. In the papers [4] and [12], the
authors dealt with the problem with unbounded terminal condition but they worked in
continuos ﬁltration. In this part, we use quadratic exponential semimartingales to ﬁnd the
solution of a quadratic BSDE with jumps in a general set up where the terminal condition
is unbounded.

5.1 Quadratic Exponential BSDE

We consider the stochastic basis deﬁned above (Ω, F , F, P) with ﬁnite time horizon T < +∞.
On this basis, let W = (Wt)t≥0 be a d-dimensional standard Brownian motion and let µ the
random measure deﬁned above such that ν is equivalent to a product measure λ ⊗ dt with
density ξ satisfying ν(ω, dt, dx) = ξ(ω, t, x)λ(dx)dt, where λ is a σ-ﬁnite measure on (E, E)

satisfyingRE |x|2λ(dx) < +∞ and where the density ξ is a measure, bounded nonnegative

function such that for some constant Cν:

0 ≤ ξ(ω, t, x) ≤ Cν < +∞, P ⊗ λ ⊗ dt − a.e .

That implies in particular ν ([0, T ] × E) ≤ CνT λ(E). We assume the following representa-
tion Theoem for any square integrable martingale M :

M = M0 + Z.W + U.eµ,
where Z and U are predictable processes such that EhR T

0 (cid:0)|Zt|2 +RE |U (t, x)|2ξ(t, x)λ(dx)(cid:1)dti <

+∞. We note H2 resp(H2
λ ) the set of predictable process Z resp( predictable process U )
satisfying this square integrability condition. Let deﬁne the following norms ||.||H2p and
||.||H2p

Deﬁnition 5.6. (Quadratic Exponential BSDE) We call quadratic exponential BSDE as-
sociated to (f, ηT ) and with parameters (l, c, δ) (in short terms we note qexp(l, c, δ) BSDE),
the following stochastic diﬀerential equation:

− dYt = f (t, Yt, Zt, Ut) − ZtdWt −ZE

where the coeﬃcient satisfying the following conditions:

A solution of a Quadratic Exponential BSDE (5.17) is a a triple (Y, Z, U ) of predictable

In particular case, where the coeﬃcient satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition and the condition Aγ
with −1 < γ < c, for some positive constant c, there exists a unique solution of the BSDE
see([7], [45]).

Theorem 5.6. i) Let consider the BSDE (5.17) with terminal value YT = ηT ∈ L2(Ω, FT )
where the coeﬃcient satisfying the following conditions:

1. Continuity and Integrability condition: for all t ∈ [0, T ], (y, z, u) −→ f (t, y, z, u) is

continuous and satisfying the integrability condition:

E(cid:20)Z T

0

|f (t, 0, 0, 0)|2dt(cid:21) < +∞.

(5.19)

2. Lipschitz condition: there exists a nonnegative constant C such that for all t ∈ [0, T ]:

|f (t, y, z, u) − f (t, ¯y, ¯z, ¯u)| ≤ C [|y − ¯y| + |z − ¯z| + |u − ¯u|t,λ] .

(5.20)

3. The bound (Aγ) condition: the coeﬃcient f satisﬁes the (Aγ) condition and there

exists a nonnegative constant c such that −1 < γ ≤ c.

then there exists a unique triple (Y, Z, U ) ∈ S 2 × H2 × H2

λ solution of the BSDE (5.17).

ii) Moreover for any BSDE with terminal value ¯ηT ≤ ηT and coeﬃcient ¯f ≤ f satisfy-
ing the same last assumptons as f , the solution ( ¯Y , ¯Z, ¯U ) associated to this BSDE satisﬁes
¯Y ≤ Y .

Remark 5.2. (Comparison result)

1. The comparison result holds true also in the case of the both coeﬃcients satisﬁes the

Lipschitz and the bound (Aγ) conditons.

2. The bound (Aγ) condition can be substituted to the (Aγ) condition since we need only

γ.eµ should be in the space Uexp to ensure the comparison result.

5.1.1 Existence of solution for quadratic BSDE with jumps

We prove the solution of the quadratic exponential BSDE using the properties of quadratic
exponential semimartingales. we construct a sequence of quadratic exponential semimartin-
gales which converges to some limit. Therefore using stability result, we ﬁnd the convergence
of the martingale part of the limit and conclude.

Remark 5.3. Let consider the triple (Y, Z, U ) solution of the qexp(l, c, δ) BSDE, then Y is
0 csds, t ≤ T. In all the rest of

a Qexp(Λ, C, δ)- semimartingale with Λt =R t

0 lsds, Ct =R t

paper without losing any generality, we assume δ = 1 and c is bounded .

Assumption 5.1. Let assume the integrability condition:

∀γ > 0, E(cid:20)exp(γ(eCT |ηT | +Z T

0

eCs dΛs))(cid:21) < +∞.

Proposition 5.6. (Construction of sequences). Let assume 5.1 and consider the qexp(l, c, 1)-
BSDE associated to (f, ηT ). We set ¯f = f 1f >0 and f = f 1f ≤0 and we deﬁne for each
n, m ∈ N the sequences of coeﬃcients ¯f n = ¯f ∨ ¯bn, f m = f ∧ bm, ¯qn = ¯q ∨ ¯bn and
qm = q ∧ bm where the regularizing functions ¯bn and bm are the convex functions with linear
growth deﬁned by ¯bn(w, r, v) = n|w| + n|r| + n|v| and bm(w, r, v) = −m|w| − m|r| − m|v|.
The symbols ∨ and ∧ stands for inf-convolution and sup-convolution.

1. The sequence ¯f n and ¯qn resp( the sequence f m and qm) are increasing and converge
to ¯f , ¯q resp ( are decreasing and converge to f , q). Moreover the sequence f m, qm,
¯f n and ¯qn satisfy the Lipschitz condition (5.20).

2. The sequences ( ¯f n)n∈N resp( the sequence (f m)
q ≤ qm ≤ f m ≤ 0), for each n, m ∈ N. Moreover

m∈N) satisﬁes 0 ≤ ¯f n ≤ ¯qn ≤ ¯q (resp

q ≤ ¯f n + f m ≤ ¯q.

Proof. Let consider the coeﬃcient f associated to the qexp(l, c, 1) BSDE. Using the proper-
ties of infconvolution and supconvolution, we deduce all the sequences of coeﬃcients deﬁned
above satisfy the Lipschitz condition, moreover we ﬁnd the monotone property comparing
using the deﬁnition of theses sequences. Let prove the lower and upper bound of ¯f n and
f m for each n, m ∈ N:

0 ≤ inf
w,r,v

{ ¯f (t, w, r, v)+n|y−w|+n|z−r|+n|u−v|} ≤ inf
w,r,v

{¯q(t, w, r, v)+n|y−w|+n|z−r|+n|u−v|}.

then we ﬁnd 0 ≤ ¯f n ≤ ¯qn ≤ ¯q. By similar arguments we ﬁnd for each m ∈ N, 0 ≥ f m ≥
qm ≥ q, hence we conclude 0 ≤ ¯f n ≤ ¯qn ≤ ¯q and q ≤ qm ≤ f m ≤ 0. Moreover, using the
last inequalities we deduce q ≤ f n + f m ≤ ¯q, for each n, m ∈ N.

Theorem 5.7. Let assume 5.1, there exists a triple (Y, Z, U ) ∈ SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) × H2p × H2p
λ
solution of the qexp(l, c, 1) BSDE associated to (f, ηT ).

21

Proof. We follow two steps to prove the existence. Firstly, we construct a sequence of
quadratic exponential semimartingales which converges and secondly we ﬁnd the conver-
gence of the ﬁnite variation and martingale part using stability result.

First step: (Construction of the sequence of SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) semimartingales). Let con-
sider a qexp(l, c, 1) BSDE associated to (f, ηT ) and consider the sequence of coeﬃcients
f n,m = ¯f n + f m which converges to f when n, m go to inﬁnity from Proposition 5.6. We
consider the BSDE associated to (f n,m, ηT ):

dWt −ZE

U n,m(t, x).eµ(dt, dx),

Since for each n, m ∈ N the coeﬃcient f n,m satisﬁes the continuity, the integrability and
the Lipschitz conditions of Theorem 5.6, there exists a solution (Y n,m, Z n,m, U n,m) of the
BSDE associated to (f n,m, ηT ). From Proposition 5.6; q ≤ f n,m ≤ ¯q, hence (Y n,m)n,m∈N
is a sequence of Q(Λ, C) semimartingales. Moreover since qm ≤ f n,m ≤ ¯qn and the triples
( ¯Y n, ¯Z n, ¯U n) and (Y m, Z m, U m) solutions of the qexp(l, c, 1) BSDE associated to (¯qn, |ηT |)
and (qm, −|ηT |) exist and satisfy for all stopping times σ ≤ T :

| ¯Y n

σ | ∨ |Y m

σ | ≤ ¯ρσ(cid:20)eCσ,T |ηT | +Z T

σ

eCσ,sdΛs(cid:21) ,

a.s

The existence of the triples is given by existsence result of Theorem 5.6, since ¯qn and qm
satisfy the continuity, the integrability and the Lipschitz conditions for each n, m ∈ N.
Moreover since they also satisfy the (Aγ)-condition, we ﬁnd by comparison result of Theo-
rem 5.6 that Y m ≤ Y n,m ≤ ¯Y n and we conclude (Y n,m)n,m∈N is a sequence of SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C)
semimartingales since for each n, m ∈ N, Y n,m is a Q(Λ, C) semimartingale satisfying:

|Y n,m

σ

| ≤ ¯ρσ(cid:20)eCσ,T |ηT | +Z T

σ

eCσ,s dΛs(cid:21) ,

a.s

(5.21)

for n, m ≥ c∗ = supt≤T ct, see more details about the characteristics of the coeﬃcient ¯qn and
qm in the Appendix Lemma 6.3. Let now prove the coeﬃcient satisﬁes the (Aγ)- condition.
For (y, z) ∈ R × Rd:

f n,m(t, y, z, u)−f n,m(t, y, z, ¯u) = [ ¯f n(t, y, z, u)− ¯f n(t, y, z, ¯u)]+[f m(t, y, z, u)−f m(t, y, z, ¯u)].

Therefore since for any functions ψ and ¯ψ:

inf
x

ψ(x) − inf
x

¯ψ(x) ≤ sup
x

{ψ(x) − ¯ψ(x)},

sup

ψ(x) − sup

x

x

¯ψ(x) ≤ sup
x

{ψ(x) − ¯ψ(x)}

(5.22)

Since the coeﬃcient f n,m satisﬁes the (Aγ) condition, we can apply comparison result see
Theoem 5.6; we deduce for each n, m ∈ N:

Y n+1,m ≥ Y n,m ≥ Y n,m+1.

Second step: (Convergence of the semimartingale, the ﬁnite variation and the martin-
gale part). For each m ∈ N, (Y n,m)n≥0 is an increasing sequence of bounded c`adl`ag

22

SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) semimartingales, with canonical decomposition Y n,m = Y n,m
0 −V n,m −M n,m.
Hence, this sequence converges, let denote Y m its limit for each m ∈ N. From stability
result, Lemma 4.1, (Y m)m is a sequence of c`adl`ag SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) semimartingales with
canonical decomposition Y m = Y m

0 − V m + M m where

n→∞

E(cid:2)(cid:0)V n,m − V m(cid:1)∗(cid:3) = 0

and

For each n, m ≥ c∗, since Y n,m ≥ Y n,m+1 then (Y m)m is a decreasing sequence of bounded
c`adl`ag SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) semimartingales. Let Y its limit, from stability result Lemma 4.1, Y
is a c`adl`ag SQ(|ηT |, Λ, C) semimartingale with canonical decomposition Y = Y0 − V + M

Lemma 6.2. For any k ≥ 1 and any local martingale M :

jt(k∆Mt) ≥ kjt(∆Mt),

0 ≤ t ≤ T

Proof. Let recall that for any local martingale M = M c + M d from representation theorem,

there exists U ∈ Gloc(µ) such that M d = U.eµ , then j(∆M d) = (eU − U − 1).ν. Therefore

from representation theorem it is suﬃcient to prove the following function fk: x −→ (ekx −
kx − 1) − k(ex − x − 1) is positive to ﬁnd the result. For any x ∈ R, since f ′
k(x) =
kex(e(k−1)x − 1), then we conclude the function fk is increasing on (0, +∞) and decreasing
on (−∞, 0). Therefore, for any x ∈ R, fk(x) ≥ fk(0) = 0.

Lemma 6.3. Let us deﬁne the following quadractic exponential coeﬃcients by ¯q(y, z, u) =
c|y| + |l| + 1
2 |z|2 − j(−u) and deﬁne the sequence
¯qn and qm by the inf-convolution and sup-convolution for n, m ≥ c∗ = supt∈[0,T ] ct:

2 |z|2 + j(u) and q(y, z, u) = −c|y| − |l| − 1

¯qn(y, z, u) = inf

{¯q(y, w, v) + n|y − r| + n|z − w| + n|u − v|}

{q(y, w, v) − m|y − r| − m|z − w| − m|u − v|}

then:

i) The sequences ¯qn and qm satisfy the structure condition Qexp(Λ, C).

ii) There exists a unique solution ( ¯Y n, ¯Z n, ¯U n) (resp. ((Ym, Zm, Um)) of the BSDE’s asso-
ciated to (¯qn, |ξT |) (resp. to (qm, −|ξT |).

Proof: i) We compute explicitly the sequence of functions ¯qn and qm which satisfy the
structure condition Qexp(Λ, C) for every n, m ≥ c∗. By deﬁnition we have

¯qn
t (y, z, u) = inf
r,w,v

{¯qt(y, w, v) + n|y − r| + n|z − w| + n|u − v|}

= c|y| + |l| + inf
w

{

1
2

|w|2 + n|z − w|} + inf
v

{jt(v) + n|u − v|}

Obviously one can ﬁnd the explicit form of ¯qn which is given by

¯qn(y, z, u) = c|y| + |l| +

|z|21{|z|≤n} + n(|z| −

)1{|z|>n}

+ZEhg(u(e))1{eu(e)−1≤n} +(cid:0) − (n + 1) ln(n + 1) + n(u(e) + 1)(cid:1)1{eu(e)−1>n}i ζt(e)ρ(de)

where we recall g(x) = ex − x − 1, using the similar arguments we ﬁnd the explicitely form
of qm:

qm(y, z, u) = −c|y| − |l| −

|z|21{|z|≤m} − m(|z| −

)1{|z|>m}

+ZEhg(−u(e))1{e−u(e)−1≤m} +(cid:0)(m + 1) ln(m + 1) + m(u(e) − 1)(cid:1)1{e−u(e)−1>m}i ζt(e)ρ(de)

then we conclude for each n, m ≥ c∗, ¯qn and qm satisfy the structure condition Qexp(Λ, C).

ii) Since the coeﬃcients ¯qn and qm are Lipschitz we deduce there exists a solution ( ¯Y n, ¯Z n, ¯U n)
resp (Ym, Zm, Um) associated to (¯qn, |ξT |) resp (qm, −|ξT |). Let now prove these coeﬃcients
satisfy the (Aγ) condition. To prove this result let ﬁrst remark that for all x ∈ R:

−(n + 1) ln(n + 1) + n(x + 1) = g[ln(n + 1)] + n(x − ln(n + 1))

Let u, ¯u, we set E =S4

i=1 Ai where

A1 = {x ∈ R, eu(x) − 1 ≤ n, e¯u(x) − 1 ≤ n}, A2 = {x ∈ R, eu(x) − 1 ≤ n, e¯u(x) − 1 > n}
A3 = {x ∈ R, eu(x) − 1 > n, e¯u(x) − 1 ≤ n}, A4 = {x ∈ R, eu(x) − 1 > n, e¯u(x) − 1 > n}

Therefore we ﬁnd for all y, z:

¯qn(y, z, u) − ¯qn(y, z, ¯u)

=ZA1
+ZA3

[g(u(x)) − g(¯u(x))]ζt(x)ρ(dx) +ZA2
[n(u(x) − ln(n + 1)) + g(ln(n + 1)) − g(¯u(x))]ζt(x)ρ(dx) +ZA4

[g(u(x)) − g(ln(n + 1)) − n(¯u(x) − ln(n + 1))]ζt(x)ρ(dx)

n(u(x) − ¯u(x))ζt(x)ρ(dx)

We now ﬁnd diﬀerents inequalities on every given subset of E:

On the set A1: we use the convex property of the coeﬀﬁent g and we deduce:

ZA1

[g(u(x)) − g(¯u(x))]ζt(x)ρ(dx) ≤ZA1

(e¯u(x) − 1)(u(x) − ¯u(x))ζt(x)ρ(dx)

(6.23)

25

On the set A2: Since on A2, the function g is increasing we ﬁnd ∀x ∈ A2, g(u(x)) ≤
g(ln(n + 1)), moreover we have ¯u(x) − ln(n + 1) ≥ 0 for x ∈ A2 then we conclude:

ZA2

[g(u(x)) − g(ln(n + 1)) − n(¯u(x) − ln(n + 1))]ζt(x)ρ(dx) ≤ 0.

(6.24)

On the set A3: we use the convex property of the coeﬃcient g and we ﬁnd g(ln(n + 1)) −
g(¯u(x)) ≤ −n(¯u(x) − ln(n + 1)),

∀x ∈ A3. Therefore, we ﬁnd:

ZA3

[n(u(x) − ln(n + 1) + g(ln(n + 1)) − g(¯u(x))]ζt(x)ρ(dx) ≤ZA3

n(u(x) − ¯u(x))ζt(x)ρ(dx)

(6.25)

Hence using (6.23), (6.24) and (6.25), we ﬁnd:

¯qn(y, z, u) − ¯qn(y, z, ¯u) =ZE

γn(u(x), ¯u(x))(u(x) − ¯u(x))ζt(x)ρ(dx)

where γn(u(x), ¯u(x)) = n1{eu(x) − 1 > n} + (e¯u(x) − 1)1A1 , then −1 ≤ γn ≤ n hence
γn ∈ U exp. Therefore the sequence ¯qn satisﬁes the Aγ condition. We use similar arguments
to prove the sequence qm satisﬁes also the Aγ condition. We conclude from Compari-
son Theorem, the uniqueness of the triple ( ¯Y n, ¯Z n, ¯U n) resp( (Ym, Zm, Um) solution of the
BSDE associated to (¯qn, |ξT |) resp((qm, −|ξT |)).

iii) Let deﬁne the cost functional of the robust optimization problems deﬁned in Lemma 6.3-
iii), ¯J Q,n and JQ,m, and deﬁne the value processes ¯V n, Vm. Assume |ξT | ∈ Lexp, |l| ∈ D1

and c bounded then the value processes of the robust optimization exist see Bordigoni,
Matoussi and Schweizer [9] for more details. Moreover we deduce for any Q ≪ P:

We use the same arguments of ﬁrst order condition to deduce the solution of the second op-
timization problem; We get the triple (Vm, Zm, Um) is the solution of the BSDE associated
to (hm, −|ξT |):

To ﬁnish the proof, we ﬁnd ¯Y n ≥ 0 and Ym ≤ 0 since |ξT | ≥ 0 and −|ξT | ≤ 0 by comparaison
theorem in Lipschitz case. Then we conclude ¯hn = ¯qn and hm = qm. for each n, m ∈ N. By
uniqueness of the solution of the BSDE associated to (¯qn, |ξT |) and (qm, −|ξT |), we conclude
¯V n = ¯Y n and Vm = Ym moreover since qm ≤ f n,m ≤ ¯qn by Comparison Theorem, we ﬁnd
Yn ≤ Y n,m ≤ ¯Y n. However, from the dual representation of ¯Y n (resp Ym) given by ¯V n
resp( Vm), we conclude by Proposition 4.2 of [4] that for any σ ≤ T :
