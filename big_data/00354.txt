ABSTRACT. Chao-Zhong Chen et al. [P roc. Amer.M ath.Soc, 2013], proved the
upper estimate λn
mp (n > m ≥ 1) for Dirichlet Shr¨odinger operators with non-
λm
negative and single-well potentials. In this paper we discuss the case of nonpositive
potentials q(x) continuous on the interval [0, 1]. We prove that if q(x) ≤ 0 and single-
barrier then λn
mp for λn > λm ≥ −2q∗, where q∗ = inf{q(0), q(1)}. Furthermore,
λm
we show that there exists ℓ0 ∈ (0, 1] such that for all ℓ ∈ (0, ℓ0], the associated eigen-
values (λn(ℓ))n≥1 (of the problem deﬁned on [0, ℓ]) satisfy λ1(ℓ) > 0 and λn(ℓ)
λm(ℓ) ≥ np
n > m ≥ 1. The value ℓ0 satisﬁes the following estimate 0 < ℓ0 ≤ pq −p

Introduction

We consider the eigenvalue problem for the one-dimensional p-Laplacian

−((y′)(p−1))′ = (p − 1)(λ − q(x))y(p−1), x ∈ [0, 1],

(1.1)

with f (p−1) = |f |p−1sgn(f ) = |f |p−2f, p > 1 and q nonpositve continuous potential
in [0, 1], with Dirichlet boundary conditions

y(0) = y(1) = 0

(1.2)

It is known (see [14, 5]) that the spectrum of problems (1.1) − (1.2) consists of a
growing sequence of inﬁnitely point λ1 < λ2 < .... < λn....
Recently, the issues of optimal estimates for the eigenvalue ratios λn
(where n > m)
λm
for the problem (1.1)−(1.2) in the case p = 2 have attracted a lot of attention (cf. [3],
[13], [6], [9]). In particular, M. Horv´ath and M. Kiss [9] showed that for nonnegative
single-well potentials λn

λm
Benguria [4] we call the function q a single-well function if q is decreasing in [0, x0] and

increasing in [x0, 1]. Analogously, q is called a single-barrier function if it is increasing
in [0, x0] and decreasing in [x0, 1]. Recently the authors [8] showed, among other
results, that for nonpositive single barrier potentials

In the case p > 1, Gabriella Bogn´ar and Ond˜rej Do˜sly [12] proved an optimal upper
estimate λn
mp of Dirichlet Schrodinger operator with nonnegative diﬀerentiable
λm
and single-well potentials q(x). Later, Chao-Zhong Chen et al.
[7] extended the
results in [12] without assumption conditions on the diﬀerentiability of q(x). In the
case of nonnegative potentials, they also proved an optimal upper estimate λn
≤ np.

In this paper, we prove that if q(x) ≤ 0 continuous and single-barrier on the
interval [0, 1], then λn
mp for λn > λm ≥ −2q∗, where q∗ = inf{q(0), q(1)}.
λm
Furthermore, we show that there exists ℓ0 ∈ (0, 1] such that for all ℓ ∈ (0, ℓ0], the
associated eigenvalues λn(ℓ) (of Problem (1.1) − (1.2) deﬁned on [0, ℓ]) satisfy λ1(ℓ) >
0 and λn(ℓ)
mp for n > m ≥ 1. The value ℓ0 satisﬁes the following estimate
0 < ℓ0 ≤ pq −p
3q∗ . As noted in Remark 2.6,our approach used in this paper can be
applied to the case of positive potentials studied in [7] .

2 Preliminaries And The Main Statements

In this section, Following [8], we introduce the modiﬁed Pr¨ufer transformation.

Fix p > 1.When q ≡ 0, equation (1.1) becomes

−((y′)(p−1))′ = (p − 1)λy(p−1), x ∈ [0, 1]

If λ = 1 let Sp be the solution of this equation satisfying the initial conditions Sp(0) =
0, S ′
p(0) = 1. A. Elbert [1], O. Dosly and P. Reh´ak [11], proved that Sp(x) and
p(x) are 2πp− periodic odd functions on R (where πp = 2π
S ′
) ). They are in fact
p sin( π
p-analogues of sin and cos functions in the classical case.
It is well known that
πp = 2π
) is the ﬁrst zero of Sp. The following lemma was proved by A. Elbert [1].

Let Tp(x) = Sp(x)
We consider a generalized Pr¨ufer substitution on the one-dimensional p-Laplacian
(1.1). With ρ = λ

p(x) = 1 + |Tp(x)|p for any x ∈ R.

(2.3)

In the sequel we enunciate the main results of this paper.
Theorem 2.3 Let q(x) ≤ 0 be monotone increasing in [0, x0]. Then ˙θ(x0, ρ) ≤ 0 for
ρ ≥ pp−2q(0). If there is a ρ ≥ pp−2q(0) with ˙θ(x0, z) = 0, then q ≡ 0 in (0, x0].
Theorem 2.4 For the system (1.1)−(1.2), if q(x) ≤ 0, continuous and single-barrier,
then the nth and mth eigenvalues with λn > λm ≥ −2q∗ (where q∗ = inf{q(0), q(1)})
satisfy

,

and if for two diﬀerent m and n equality holds, then q ≡ 0 in (0, 1).

Consider the following boundary problem

−((y′)(p−1))′ = (p − 1)(λ − q(x))y(p−1), x ∈ [0, ℓ]

y(0) = y(ℓ) = 0,
and let λn(ℓ), n ≥ 1 be the associated eigenvalues.

(2.4)

(2.5)

Theorem 2.5 Assume that q ≤ 0, continuous and single-barrier in [0, 1]. Then,
there exists ℓ0 ∈ (0, 1] such that for all ℓ ∈ (0, ℓ0] the associated eigenvalues λn(ℓ)
(of P roblem (2.4) − (2.5) def ined on [0, ℓ]) satisfy λ1(ℓ) > 0 and for the nth and mth
eigenvalues with n > m ≥ 1,

λn(ℓ)
λm(ℓ)

and if for two diﬀerent m and n equality holds, then q ≡ 0 in [0, ℓ0].
The value ℓ0 satisﬁes the following estimate 0 < ℓ0 ≤ pq −p
3q∗ , where q∗ = inf{q(0), q(1)}.
Remark 2.6 For q(x) ≥ 0 and single-well we have ϕ′(x, λ) > 0 for x ∈ [0, x0] and
λ > 0. This implies that the associated ˙θ(λ) can be written as entire series in λ > 0.
Therefore, the ratios estimation λn
