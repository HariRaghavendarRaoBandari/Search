We study the eﬀect of strong magnetic ﬁelds, of the order of 1015 − 1017 G, on the extension of
the crust of magnetized neutron stars. The dynamical instability region of neutron-proton-electron
(npe) matter at subsaturation densities and the mode with the largest growth rate are determined
within a relativistic mean ﬁeld model. It is shown that a strong magnetic ﬁeld has a large eﬀect on
the instability region, deﬁning the crust-core transition as a wide density range.

Soft γ-ray repeaters and some anomalous X-ray pulsars
are strongly magnetized neutron stars known as magne-
tars [1–3]. These stars have strong surface magnetic ﬁelds
of the order of 1014 − 1015 G [4], and slow rotation with a
period of ∼ 1 − 12 s. Recently, the time evolution of the
magnetic ﬁeld of isolated X-ray pulsars has been studied
by Pons et al.
[5]. The authors have shown that a fast
decay of the magnetic ﬁeld could explain the non obser-
vation of stars with periods above 12 s. The decay of the
magnetic ﬁeld was attributed to a high electrical resis-
tivity of the inner crust, possibly due to the existence of
an amorphous and heterogeneous layer at the bottom of
the inner crust. The lack of isolated X-ray pulsars with
a period higher than 12s, could, therefore, be a direct
indication of the existence of an amorphous inner crust,
possibly in the form of pasta phases [5].

At low nuclear matter densities, a competition be-
tween the long-range Coulomb repulsion and short-range
nuclear attraction will lead to the formation of cluster-
ized matter, known as nuclear pasta [6], near the crust-
core transition. These geometrical conﬁgurations are ob-
served not only in nuclear matter, but in a variety of
amorphous solids, crystals, and magnetic and biological
materials [7]. One of the main interests on the existence
of these exotic structures in the crust of neutron stars is
the eﬀect that they might have on the neutrino transport,
and subsequent cooling of the neutron star [8].

Molecular dynamics simulations of the nuclear pasta
have shown that topological defects in the pasta could
increase electron scattering and reduce the electrical and
the thermal conductivities [9]. Eletron conductivity in
magnetized neutron star matter was also studied in [10],
and it was shown that the electron transport is strongly
anisotropic, due to the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds.
The complexity introduced by the magnetic ﬁeld suggests
that both suppression and enhancement of the electron
conduction in the presence of the pasta phases are possi-
ble, and further calculations are required.

Stellar matter contains, besides neutrons and protons,
also electrons, that neutralize the proton charge. The
transition clusterized-homogeneous matter has been es-
timated using diﬀerent methods. In particular, in [11], it
has been shown that a Thomas-Fermi (TF) description

of the pasta phase predicts the same crust-core transi-
tion density as a dynamical spinodal calculation, which
allows independent electron and proton density ﬂuctua-
tions. The same conclusion was drawn in [12], where it
was shown that the dynamical spinodal calculation gives
a lower limit on the crust-core density, and that the larger
the isospin asymmetry, the closer this value is to the TF
result. For β−equilibrium matter, both results are prac-
tically coincident.

The importance of the thermodynamical and dynam-
ical spinodal on the determination of the behavior of a
system that enters an instability region was also pointed
out to be connected with nuclear multifragmentation, in
particular the time evolution of a compound nucleus dur-
ing a heavy ion collision. These instabilities are associ-
ated to the density region where the curvature of the free
energy is negative ([13],[14]).

Very strong magnetic ﬁelds will inﬂuence the proton
charge ﬂuctuations, and correspondingly the transport
properties [10]. This eﬀect was not considered in the
above studies. We will study in the present Letter the
eﬀect of a strong magnetic ﬁeld on collective modes of
stellar matter and dynamical instabilities. This is the
ﬁrst time that such a study is being considered, as far as
we know. In a previous work, some of the authors have
studied the eﬀect of strong magnetic ﬁelds in the nuclear
pasta phase, using relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF) models
within a TF calculation. However, only magnetic ﬁelds
above 1017G and large proton fractions were considered
[15] and the anomalous magnetic moments (AMM) of
protons and neutrons were neglected. Moreover, some
results showed abrupt behaviors, which were not totally
understood.

Here, we will restrict ourselves to the longitudinal
modes arising from small oscillations around a station-
ary state in asymmetric nuclear matter at subsaturation
densities. This investigation will be performed in the
framework of a relativistic mean ﬁeld hadronic model
within the Vlasov formalism [16–18]. We will study the
eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld on the spinodal section, the
clusterized-homogeneous matter transition, and the av-
erage size of clusters in the nonhomogeneous phase.

Stellar matter is described within the nuclear relativis-

tic mean-ﬁeld formalism under the eﬀect of strong mag-
netic ﬁelds [19, 20], including the eﬀect of the AMM.
Nucleons with mass M interact with and through an
isoscalar-scalar ﬁeld φ with mass ms, an isoscalar-vector
ﬁeld V µ with mass mv, and an isovector-vector ﬁeld bµ
with mass mρ. Besides nucleons, electrons will also be in-
cluded in the Lagrangian density. Protons and electrons
interact through the electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ, which in-
cludes the static component Aµ
stat = (0, 0, Bx, 0), so that
B=B ˆz and ∇ · A=0. The static electromagnetic ﬁeld is
assumed to be externally generated, and only frozen-ﬁeld
conﬁgurations will be considered for this component.

The Lagrangian density (taking c =  =1) can be writ-

ten as L = Pi=p,n Li + Le + Lσ + Lω + Lρ + LA, with

and strength κi, with κn = −1.91315 for the neutron,
and κp = 1.79285 for the proton, and µN is the nuclear
magneton. As discussed in [21], the contribution of the
AMM of electrons is negligible and will not be considered.
For the nuclear matter parameters, we will consider the
NL3 parametrization [22].

We will determine the dynamical spinodal within the
Vlasov formalism discussed in [16, 17]. We denote by
f (r, p, t) = diag(fp, fn, fe) the distribution function for
npe matter at position r, instant t and momentum p,
and by h = diag (hp, hn, he) the corresponding one-body

Collective modes correspond to small oscillations
around the equilibrium state. These small deviations
are described by the linearized equations of motion and
the collective modes are the solutions of those equa-
tions. Let the deviations from equilibrium be described

0 + δV0 ,
Vi = δVi , b0 = b(0)

netic ﬁeld and frequency ω, described by the ansatz

of ﬁve independent equations of motion are obtained, in
terms of the amplitudes Ai

scalar density ﬂuctuations, and the proton, neutron and
electron vector density ﬂuctuations. The eigenmodes ω
of the system are the solutions of the dispersion relation
obtained, equating to zero the determinant of the matrix
of the coeﬃcients of the ﬁve equations of motion.

The region in (ρp, ρn) space for a given wave vector k,
satisfying ω = 0, deﬁnes the dynamical spinodal surface.
At low densities, the system presents unstable modes,
characterized by an imaginary frequency. We will also
calculate, inside the unstable region, the mode with the
largest growth rate Γ, such that ω = iΓ, which is the one
that drives the system to the formation of instabilities.
Its half-wavelength gives a good estimation of the most
probable size of the clusters (liquid) formed in the mixed
(liquid-gas) phase [18].

In the following, some of the possible eﬀects of strong
magnetic ﬁelds on the structure of the inner crust of mag-
netars are discussed from the analysis of the dynamical
spinodal surface and the unstable modes with the largest

growth rate inside this region. This approach takes into
account ﬁnite size eﬀects, such as the surface tension and
Coulomb eﬀects.

In Fig. 1, we show the spinodal sections in the (ρp,ρn)
space for the magnetic ﬁelds 1.1 × 1016 G, 8.8 × 1016 G,
and 4.4 × 1017 G, calculated for a wave number k = 50
MeV, which gives a spinodal section close to the envelope
of all spinodal sections. The calculations were carried out
including AMM, except for the largest ﬁeld, for which
we also show the no AMM spinodal. The proton and
neutron AMM give rise to extra bands. The thick black
line represents the spinodal section for a zero magnetic
ﬁeld. The dashed line is the EoS of β-equilibrium matter,
and allows the identiﬁcation the crust-core transition.

The most intense ﬁelds detected on the surface of a
magnetar are not larger than 2×1015 G, the smallest ﬁeld
we will consider. We may, however, expect stronger ﬁelds
in the interior. In particular, toroidal ﬁelds more intense
than 1017G have been obtained in stable conﬁgurations
[23, 24].

A magnetic ﬁeld equal to 4.4 × 1017 G is strong enough
to create bands of instability at densities above 0.05
fm−3, see right panel of Fig. 1, associated with the ﬁlling
of the diﬀerent Landau levels. In [25], the thermodynami-
cal spinodal section, which corresponds to the k = 0 limit
of the dynamical spinodal, was studied for ﬁelds equal or
above 5×1018 G. Spinodal bands are also present, al-
though the stronger the ﬁeld, the smaller the number of
bands. The appearance of bands was attributed to the
behavior of the proton chemical potential within each
Landau band: at the bottom of the band it has a very
soft behavior, however, at the top of the Landau level
it hardens and a cusp occurs when a new Landau level
opens, followed by a softening of the chemical potential.
Here, these bands can extend to neutron densities above
0.1 fm−3, while the B = 0 spinodal does not go beyond
ρn = 0.065 fm−3. The transition to homogeneous mat-
ter does not follow a sharp border: there is a region of
width ∼ 0.05 fm−3, separating homogeneous matter from
completely clusterized matter.

A magnetic ﬁeld ﬁve times weaker, B = 8.8 × 1016G,
is still creating bands of instability along the spinodal
surface, giving rise to a diﬀuse separation between ho-
mogeneous and clusterized matter. As the ﬁeld becomes
weaker, the spinodal section gets closer to the B = 0

FIG. 2. Largest growth rate Γ = |ω| (top panel), the cor-
responding half-wavelength (middle panel) and the proton-

black curve corresponds to the B = 0 results.

section. However, the region where the eﬀects of the
magnetic ﬁeld are stronger is precisely the one of interest
for the description of magnetized neutron stars, namely
the low proton density. Even for B = 1016G, the diﬀusi-
ness of the border between clusterized and homogeneous
matter is of the order of 0.01 fm−3.

It was shown in [11] that the size of the clusters in
the inner crust of a neutron star, calculated within the
Thomas-Fermi framework for RMF models, is well es-
timated by the half-wave length associated to the most
unstable mode, i.e., the one that drives matter into a non-
homogeneous phase [26]. In the same work, it was also
shown that for NL3 the average proton fraction in the
inner crust, for densities above 0.01 fm−3, is yp ∼ 0.02.
We have, therefore, determined the most unstable modes
for magnetized matter with a proton fraction yp = 0.02,
in order to get an estimation of the size of the clusters
formed in the inner crust.

In Fig. 2, the largest growth rates (top panels), the
corresponding half-wave length (middle panels) and the
ratio δρp/δρn between the proton and neutron density
ﬂuctuations (bottom panels) are shown for ﬁelds between
B = 2.2 × 1015 G and 8.8 × 1016. In all ﬁgures, the B = 0
results are represented by a black curve.

First, we consider the strongest ﬁeld, represented by
blue dots in the right panel of Fig. 2.
In this case,
there are several well deﬁned regions of clusterized mat-
ter separated by regions of homogeneous matter. This
is a consequence of the bands of instability, due to the
ﬁlling of the Landau levels. Also, the size of the clusters
is aﬀected:
in the ﬁrst region of instability, the size of
the clusters oscillates around the results for B = 0, and
fast size changes occur in a very small density interval;
the instability regions in the range [0,0.1] fm−3 are sev-
eral, although the larger the density the smaller they are.
Considering weaker ﬁelds, all these features are repeated
with milder eﬀects. The behavior of the growth rates,
and corresponding wave number, indicate that the struc-
ture of the inner crust in the presence of strong magnetic
ﬁelds is complex, the complexity being larger if a large
number of Landau levels is involved.

The proton-neutron density ﬂuctuation ratio was also
calculated: although the very low proton fraction consid-
ered corresponds to ρp/ρn = 1/49, the ﬂuctuations give
rise to clusterized matter with a much larger content, in
particular, δρp/δρn > 0.5 at the crust-core transition.
For the larger ﬁelds, this ratio can be as large as 1, as we
can see in the bottom panels of Fig. 2.

The behavior of the spinodal sections and the growth
rates discussed above indicate that the complete inner
crust of the neutron star in the presence of a strong mag-
netic ﬁeld may have a much more heterogeneous struc-
ture than the one obtained at zero magnetic ﬁeld. Besides
a possible succession of clusterized and homogeneous re-
gions of matter for the stronger ﬁelds, two other eﬀects
are important: the ﬂuctuation of the cluster size and of
the proton fraction of the clusters, as indicated by the
density ﬂuctuations. If larger proton fractions occur in a
region where the size of cluster changes in a short density
range, this will lead to a larger impurity parameter, as
required from the calculation of [5].

In conclusion, we have shown that Landau levels orig-
inate a structure of bands at the border between cluster-
ized and homogeneous matter, that may have an exten-
sion larger than 0.05 fm−3, for the strongest ﬁeld consid-
ered, but will still be wider than 0.01 fm−3 for B ∼ 1015
G, if small proton fractions are considered. We expect
that this diﬀuse border will give rise to a more heteroge-
neous and amorphous phase of matter than the one al-
ready expected due to the formation of the pasta phases.

Studies of electron conduction in this matter are needed
to conﬁrm whether it would reduce electron conductiv-
ity, and thus originate a resistive layer within the crust
of magnetized neutron stars, as proposed in [5].

The study was complemented with the determination
of the largest growth rate inside the spinodal surface,
which has allowed to estimate the size of the clusters
formed, when the system is driven into a nonhomoge-
neous phase. Compared with the B = 0 situation, it
was shown that close to the transition to homogeneous
matter, and due to the existence of a non-sharp spinodal
section, there is a heterogeneous region that alternates
non-homogeneous with homogeneous matter. Besides, it
was also shown that inside the spinodal section, the aver-
age size of the clusters and its proton content vary in an
oscillatory way, reinforcing the heterogeneity of the inner
crust matter with a direct eﬀect on the charge impurity
parameter, in particular, if magnetic ﬁeld intensities in-
volve several Landau levels.

Although we expect that the results discussed in
this work are general, we should remark that the NL3
parametrization predicts a quite low proton fraction for
sub-saturation stellar matter. Other parametrizations
may predict larger proton fractions [27], and in this case
the eﬀects described here need stronger ﬁelds to occur.

To conclude, we refer another pulsar property that
could be aﬀected by an increase of the crust. Pulsar
glitches are attributed to the angular momentum trans-
fer between the crust and the core [28], involving the vor-
tex dynamics associated to the neutron superﬂuid con-
ﬁned to the inner crust. However, the recent detection
of an anti-glitch [29], or the indication that due to en-
trainment the inner crust angular moment is not enough
to explain the glitch mechanism [30], suggests that the
glitch theory has to be clariﬁed. The eﬀects of the mag-
netic ﬁeld on the inner crust, in particular, an increase of
the crust, the succession of clusterized and homogeneous
layers, and a non-monotonic change of the neutron gas
background density will certainly aﬀect the glitch mecha-
nism and should be taken into account in a glitch theory.
The present study indicates that the magnetic ﬁeld
is making the inner crust more heterogeneous, meaning
that the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld on the EoS should
be taken into account explicitly, and that pasta phase
calculations should be performed.
