A numerical investigation of two locally applied drag reducing control schemes is carried
out in the conﬁguration of a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer (TBL). One
control is designed to damp near-wall turbulence and the other induces constant mass
ﬂux in the wall-normal direction. Both control schemes yield similar local drag reduc-
tion rates within the control region. However, the ﬂow development downstream of the
control signiﬁcantly diﬀers: persistent drag reduction is found for the uniform blowing
case whereas drag increase is found for the turbulence damping case. In order to ac-
count for this diﬀerence the formulation of a global drag reduction rate is suggested. It
represents the reduction of the streamwise force exerted by the ﬂuid on a ﬁnite length
plate. Furthermore, it is shown that the far downstream development of the TBL after
the control region can be described by a single quantity, namely a streamwise shift of the
uncontrolled boundary layer, i.e. a changed virtual origin. Based on this result, a simple
model is developed that allows relating for the local drag reduction rate to the global one
without the need of conducting expensive simulations or measurements far downstream
of the control region.

Key words: boundary layer control, drag reduction, turbulent boundary layers

1. Introduction

Drag reducing ﬂow control is a topic of great interest due to its practical signiﬁcance
for engineering application in diﬀerent high-speed transport systems such as airplanes,
marine vessels or pipelines. A broad variety of control methods aiming at the reduction of
skin friction drag in turbulent wall bounded ﬂows has been introduced in the past. Clas-
sical active control schemes such as opposition control (Choi et al. 1994), suboptimal and
optimal control techniques (Choi et al. 1993; Lee et al. 1998; Bewley et al. 2001), various
wall movements (Quadrio 2011) and direct damping of near-wall ﬂuctuations (Iwamoto
et al. 2005; Frohnapfel et al. 2010) have been thoroughly investigated during the last 20
years. These control schemes are often investigated using direct numerical simulations
(DNS) of fully developed turbulent channel ﬂow (TCF) assuming periodic boundary con-
ditions in stream- and spanwise directions with control activated on the entire area of
both channel walls. Although the TCF conﬁguration has been a longstanding proven tool

for the evaluation of control eﬀects on the ﬂow ﬁeld, the global eﬀect of locally applied
control in a developing boundary layer is of major interest for the potential application
of ﬂow control in practice. This point is highlighted by Spalart & McLean (2011) who
present an analytic estimation of the drag reducing eﬀect due to laminarization near the
leading edge of a TBL. They draw attention to the fact that local and global control
eﬀects need to be distinguished when a TBL is locally altered.

Recently, several studies, in which diﬀerent control strategies are analyzed in TBL, have
been presented. In principle drag reduction in TBL can be achieved not only through
the suppression of Reynolds shear stress, which is the typical strategy in TCF, but also
by application of other control methods. For example, the introduction of wall-normal
mass ﬂux is another drag reducing option (Mickley & Davis 1957), which is thoroughly
discussed based on DNS results in Kametani & Fukagata (2011) and Kametani et al.
(2015). Stroh et al. (2015) present a comparison of opposition control that aims at the
suppression of the Reynolds shear stress in TCF and TBL and show that in spite of the
very similar drag reduction rates that are achieved in both ﬂows, the underlying drag
reduction mechanisms are quite diﬀerent.

Transient eﬀects in TBL have sometimes been reported in literature. However, the
main focus of these publications is not on the streamwise development of the TBL after
the control and the corresponding computational domains are rather short so that the
reported results are limited to a narrow region right after the control. Park & Choi (1999)
conducted a DNS of TBL with local uniform blowing and suction and report a rapid
decrease of the skin friction coeﬃcient in the blowing region and a strong increase further
downstream leading to negative local drag reduction rates. Similar results are reported
by Kim et al. (2002). Pami`es et al. (2007) present large eddy simulation data comparing
locally applied uniform blowing, opposition control and blowing-only opposition control
techniques. Downstream of the control they observe local drag increase for the blowing
strategies and drag reduction for classical opposition control over a short region before the
uncontrolled state is recovered. Oscillating wall control in TBL is discussed by Yudhistira
& Skote (2011) and Lardeau & Leschziner (2013). The former study analyzes the transient
behavior at the beginning of the control region and the latter reports a reduction of the
local skin friction drag downstream of the control area. Considering that a local ﬂow state
in spatially developing ﬂow is generally determined as a result of the upstream events, it
is possible that a local control aﬀects the ﬂow state far downstream of the control region.
This is an important aspect for potential practical applications, where the realization of
a control technique on the entire wall might not be feasible, so that global drag reduction
has to be achieved with a limited control area size.

In the present work we focus on the downstream development of a TBL and the
resultant wall friction after control has been applied locally. This is achieved through
DNS of TBL with suﬃciently large streamwise domain length after a controlled region.
In the control region, drag reduction is achieved by either applying uniform blowing or
by damping near-wall turbulence. The latter is a simpliﬁed representation of all classical
TCF control techniques that lead to a suppression of the Reynolds shear stress. Both
control schemes are adjusted such that similar drag reduction rates are realized in the
control region. However, the downstream development of friction drag is quite diﬀerent
depending on the type of control applied. We propose the deﬁnition of a global drag
reduction rate for TBL that is based on the overall drag acting on a plate of ﬁnite length
and show that this quantity is strongly inﬂuenced by the drag properties downstream of
the control region. While the drag reduction achieved in the control region is speciﬁc to
the applied control strategy, the streamwise development of friction drag far downstream
of the control region can generally be explained by the von K´arm´an integral momentum

equation. Based on this knowledge we propose a simple model for the drag estimation
far downstream of the control region.

2. Numerical Procedure

The investigation is performed using DNS of a TBL under zero pressure gradient
condition. A weak random volume forcing in wall-normal direction close to the inlet plane
is utilized for the boundary layer tripping and the fringe region technique is employed
near the domain outlet. The code and numerical domain conﬁguration correspond to the
ones reported in Schlatter et al. (2009) and Schlatter & ¨Orl¨u (2012).

Figure 1(a) demonstrates the general conﬁguration of the numerical experiment with
a local control region in the TBL and introduces a coordinate system with x, y and
z representing streamwise, wall-normal and spanwise coordinate axes, respectively. The
velocity components are denoted by u, v and w, correspondingly. The present conﬁgu-
ration enables the development of a TBL up to Re θ = 2500 for the uncontrolled case
with Re θ = U∞θ/ν. Throughout the paper we consider only the turbulent region of the
ﬂow as shown in Figure 1(b). The momentum thickness at the beginning of the turbulent
region, θ (xt), and the free-stream velocity at the upper boundary, U∞, are used for the
non-dimensionalization of all quantities. The beginning of the turbulent region is located
97 length units inside the numerical domain, which corresponds to a local Reynolds num-
ber of Re θ = 365. In the following, the origin of the x-coordinate is placed at xt. This
is diﬀerent from the streamwise coordinate used in the deﬁnition of Re x = U∞x∗/ν,
where x∗ marks the distance from the virtual origin of the uncontrolled TBL. For the
current simulation the position is estimated to be 289 length units upstream of xt (Bobke
et al. 2016). Re θ of the uncontrolled case, x normalized by θ (xt) and Re x are used as
alternative streamwise coordinates of the simulation domain. Statistical integration is
performed during a time period of at least 40δ99/uτ at Re θ = 2500 after the controlled
ﬂow reached an equilibrium state. This corresponds to approximately 32000 viscous time
units.

In order to assess the global turbulent drag reducing eﬀect along a plate of ﬁnite length

and deﬁne a global turbulent drag reduction rate based on this integral parameter (as-
suming the laminar and transitional development upstream of x = 0 remains unchanged)

(2.4)

It should be noted that the global drag reduction rate R (x) is not identical to the
streamwise integral of the local drag reduction rate r (x) since the skin friction coeﬃcient
of the uncontrolled ﬂow changes in streamwise direction.

Two active control methods with diﬀerent mechanisms leading to drag reduction are
considered, namely, uniform blowing at the wall and body force damping of wall-normal
ﬂuctuations. Control is applied locally in streamwise direction, while the spanwise extent
of the control region covers the entire domain width. Both control types are placed at
the same position, x0 = 131, within the turbulent region with the same control region
extension, ∆xc = 247, as shown in Figure 1(b). This corresponds to a Reynolds number
range of Re θ = 470 − 695. The location is deﬁned by the control input proﬁle:

f (x) =

for x0 (cid:54) x (cid:54) x0 + ∆xc

1,
0, otherwise.

(2.5)

(cid:40)

Additionally, the control amplitude is smoothly increased and decreased within a spatial
extent of 14 length units at the edges inside the control region using a hyperbolic tangent
function in order to prevent the Gibbs phenomena.

For uniform blowing the control input is constant in time and deﬁned as

vw (x) = α · f (x) ,

(2.6)

where vw is the wall-normal velocity at the wall and α represents the blowing intensity.
Body force damping is based on the control algorithms proposed by Iwamoto et al. (2005)
and Frohnapfel et al. (2010). The control law aims at the suppression of wall-normal
ﬂuctuations in the near-wall region and utilizes the wall normal velocity component as
sensor information. The control input is given as body force in y-direction:

by(x, y, z, t) = − f (x) · g (y)

Φ

· v(x, y, z, t),

(2.7)

where Φ is a time constant of the forcing that determines the relative strength of the
applied body force. The body force is applied up to y = 2.5 such that

(cid:40)

g(y) =

for 0 (cid:54) y (cid:54) 2.5

1,
0, otherwise.

(2.8)

The control amplitude is smoothly decreased in wall-normal direction within 1.5 < y <
2.5. Using viscous units based on the local wall shear stress of the uncontrolled TBL the
body force is activated in the region up to y+ ≈ 45.

Both control schemes are adjusted to yield a similar global drag reduction rate inside

the control region. In order to achieve this, the blowing intensity is set to α = 0.5% of
U∞ and the forcing time constant to Φ = 5/3.

3. Results

Figure 2 shows the inﬂuence of the applied control on the turbulent structures of the
ﬂow. Due to cancellation of the wall-normal ﬂuctuations in the near wall region a strongly
pronounced attenuation of turbulence can be observed for body force damping. The eﬀect
is also visible over a certain extent downstream of the control region, where a re-transition
of the ﬂow occurs. In contrast, the application of uniform blowing rather leads to visible
thickening of the TBL due to additional wall-normal mass and momentum, which is
accompanied by an enhancement of turbulent activity.

3.1. Local and global turbulent drag reduction rates

Figure 3(a) shows the streamwise evolution of the skin friction coeﬃcient for the con-
sidered control schemes. The corresponding local drag reduction rate is depicted in Fig-
ure 3(b). Both schemes cause signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the skin friction coeﬃcient re-
sulting in local drag reduction rates with maximum values of 63% and 55%, respectively.
For body force damping, drag reduction increases gradually inside the control region
(131 (cid:54) x (cid:54) 378) and approaches the maximum of r = 63% at the end of the control
region. Downstream of the controlled region, r ﬁrst decays, reaches a negative peak, and
then gradually converges to zero. This result is in agreement with Lardeau & Leschziner
(2013). For uniform blowing, r starts to increase upstream of the control region already.
It peaks at r = 53%, decreases inside the control region and rises back to 55% at the
end of the control region. This local decrease of r inside the control region is also found
in Park & Choi (1999) and Pami`es et al. (2007). A positive r remains downstream of
the control region, which gradually decays towards zero. This downstream behavior is
in a good agreement with the results reported by Kametani et al. (2015), but it diﬀers
from the data presented in Park & Choi (1999) and Kim et al. (2002) where negative r is
reported downstream of the blowing section. This apparent contradiction can be solved
through a simple parameter variation, which reveals that the downstream behavior di-
rectly after the control section strongly depends on the control conﬁguration. Results of

such a parameter variation are shown in Appendix A. It is found that a shorter control
region with the same blowing amplitude causes a local negative r directly after the con-
trol. This is in agreement with the observations of Park & Choi (1999) and Kim et al.
(2002), where only a short region after the control is employed due to a limited stream-
wise domain size. The larger domain size in the present DNS reveals that - also in these
cases - r assumes positive values far downstream of the control region. Persistent drag
reduction far downstream of the control is therefore a characteristic property of uniform
blowing.

The evolution of r downstream of the control region signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the inte-
gral turbulent skin friction drag and the global turbulent drag reduction rate when a
longer section of the ﬂat plate after the control region is taken into consideration. The
corresponding results for ∆[cf ]x = [cf,0]x − [cf ]x and R are shown in Figure 3(c) and (d),
respectively. The control schemes were set up to yield a similar global behavior within
the control region, which is reﬂected in the ﬁgures. Both reach ∆[cf ]x ≈ 0.5 and R ≈ 30%
at the end of the control. In the case of uniform blowing ∆[cf ]x continuously increases
downstream of the control while body force damping produces a peak of ∆[cf ]x around
x = 525 before it decreases continuously. In terms of R it can be seen that for the present
case body force damping will outperform uniform blowing if a plate up to a total length
of x ≈ 800 is considered. For a longer plate, uniform blowing yields better global behav-
ior. It should be emphasized that the global drag reduction rate up to x = 3000 achieved
by uniform blowing is 56% larger than that by body force damping, although they yield
very similar drag reduction rate within the control region. This is solely caused by the
diﬀerent behavior downstream of the control region.

corresponding spatial shift ∆xs. The shaded areas mark the location of the control region.

3.2. Boundary layer development downstream of the control region

The persistent local drag change after the control region shown in Figure 3 suggests
that the TBL recovers to the canonical state with a slightly diﬀerent boundary layer
thickness than it would have been at the same position in the uncontrolled case. This
is conﬁrmed in Figure 4(a), where the spatial development of the momentum thickness
for the two controlled cases are shown. Depending on the type of applied control, the
momentum thickness at a certain streamwise position downstream of the control is either
increased or decreased. The suppression of turbulence with body force damping leads
to reduced momentum loss in the controlled region and thus to less increase of the
momentum thickness. In contrast, uniform blowing directly increases the boundary layer
thickness. This diﬀerence in momentum thickness remains even after the ﬂow returns
to an uncontrolled equilibrium state. We therefore propose that the remaining eﬀect far
downstream of the control region can be described by a streamwise shift ∆xs of the
virtual origin of the TBL as indicated in Figure 4(a). The solid lines in ﬁgure Figure 4(b)
show the evaluation of ∆xs based on minimizing the diﬀerence between θ of the controlled
case and θ0

min (θ0 (x) − θ (x + ∆xs))2 .

(3.1)

It can be seen that the considered ∆xs converges to a constant value downstream of
the control region. We note that evaluating ∆xs based on proﬁles of urms, vrms, wrms
or u(cid:48)v(cid:48) leads to very similar results. It assumes positive values for body force damping
and negative ones for uniform blowing. This diﬀerent shift is consistent with the long
tails of negative and positive r observed for body force damping and uniform blowing,
respectively, far downstream of the controlled region (see Figure 3). Since the wall friction
in the uncontrolled ﬂow decreases monotonically with increasing streamwise distance
from the leading edge, the positive/negative shift of the leading edge corresponds to an
increase/decrease of local wall friction at a ﬁxed streamwise position x. In this respect,
uniform blowing is advantageous if long distances after the control are present because
it yields not only a signiﬁcant drag reduction in the controlled region, but also a greater
momentum thickness (and thereby lower wall friction) downstream of the control region
due to a negative ∆xs.

3.3. Relation between local control and the resultant streamwise shift

In order to investigate the control eﬀect on the spatial development of the momentum
thickness in more detail, we revisit the von K´arm´an integral momentum equation (von
K´arm´an 1921; Goldschmied 1951) describing the relationship between θ and the wall

The second term on the right-hand-side is proportional to the net-mass-ﬂux from the
wall up to a streamwise distance x, and is present only for (uniform) blowing. The
contribution from the streamwise integral of the last two terms in Eq. (3.2) is found to
be insigniﬁcant (< 5% of [cf ]x for x > 2100 from simulation results) and is therefore
neglected (Schlatter et al. 2010). The spatial development of θ estimated by Eq. (3.3) is
in excellent agreement with the simulation results for both control cases (not shown here
due to a complete agreement of the curves). In the case of body force damping, the control
does not cause mass ﬂux across the wall, and therefore the second term in Eq. (3.3) is
always null. In this case, drag reduction - i.e. a lower [cf ]x - always leads to a slower
increase of the momentum thickness. For uniform blowing, however, the second term is
positive, and therefore the momentum thickness can be greater than the uncontrolled
value although a reduction of the ﬁrst term, i.e., wall friction, is achieved. This indicates
that the positive net-mass-ﬂux from the wall is necessary to increase the momentum
thickness, and thereby achieve drag reduction far downstream of a drag-reduced region.
Although Eq. (3.3) can be used to estimate the change of the momentum thickness
caused by an arbitrary local control, it is not convenient to describe the downstream
development of the ﬂow ﬁeld since ∆θ is a function of x. In this respect, it is more useful
to convert the change in momentum thickness to the streamwise shift ∆xs introduced in
the previous section. An estimation of the streamwise shift from the change in momen-
tum thickness can be performed using the empirical relationship between Re x and Re θ
proposed by Nagib et al. (2007):

with κ = 0.41 and B = 5.2 (Pope 2000), which provide a good agreement with the
present simulation results. The resulting relation between ∆xs and θ downstream of the

In Figure 4(b), the estimate of ∆xs based on Eq. (3.5) is also plotted. It can be seen
that it agrees well with the DNS data if regions far enough downstream are considered. A
schematic of TBL subject to local control is shown in Figure 5. We name the region where
an agreement with shifted uncontrolled solution is reached fully developed and refer to
the region directly downstream of the control region as transient region. For the present
cases we ﬁnd a streamwise shift in the fully developed region of ∆xs = 204 for body force
damping and ∆xs = −365 for uniform blowing, respectively. The corresponding length
of the transient region is given by ∆xtr = 500 and ∆xtr = 750.

3.4. Inﬂuence of the control placement

Local and global drag reduction rates are also inﬂuenced by the exact placement of the
control. A parametric study with varying location of the control region reveals that the
application of drag reducing control closer to the leading edge of the TBL is generally
more beneﬁcial in terms of integral drag reduction despite the fact that the local drag
reduction rates show opposite trends for the two control conﬁgurations.

As an example, Figure 6 presents a comparison for diﬀerent control placements. The
beginning of the control region is placed at x0 = 131 and x0 = 1870, while all other control
parameters are kept the same in physical units; i.e. ∆xc = 247, turbulence damping is
applied up to y = 2.5 and the injected mass ﬂow rate is ﬁxed. It should be noted that
these values correspond to diﬀerent values in local viscous units, i.e. when body force
damping is placed farther downstream the control is activated in the region up to y+ ≈ 38.
Figures 6(a,b) show the local drag reduction rate for these cases.

For body force damping the local control performance is slightly reduced in the case
when the control is placed farther downstream (57% maximum drag reduction instead of
63%). A similar eﬀect is known for TCF where r decreases for increasing friction Reynolds
number when control is applied in the same near wall region in terms of viscous units
(Iwamoto et al. 2002). For TBL uτ slightly decreases with distance from the leading
edge while the boundary layer thickness signiﬁcantly increases. Therefore, a placement
further downstream corresponds to a placement at higher friction Reynolds number. The
reduction of r with increasing Reτ is not surprising in the sense that the ratio of the
wall-normal height of the control region to the boundary layer thickness is smaller; i.e.
20% at x0 = 131 and 5% at x0 = 1870. Although the general decrease of r with increasing
Reynolds number for wall based skin friction drag reducing techniques is well known for
TCF, the exact relationship is subject of present investigations (Gatti & Quadrio 2015).
In contrast, for uniform blowing the local control performance is slightly increased for
farther downstream positioning of the control (59% maximum drag reduction instead
of 55%). This diﬀerence can be understood if one considers the injected mass ﬂow rate
in viscous units. The viscous length scales decrease with x such that in viscous units
the injected mass ﬂow rate is larger at the further downstream position. Therefore, the
resulting change in skin friction drag is larger.

Since the local change of skin friction drag directly aﬀects the change of the momentum
thickness far downstream, as shown in Figures 6(c,d), the control placement farther
downstream results in a smaller positive ∆θ for body force damping and a larger negative
∆θ for uniform blowing. With respect to the global drag reduction rate Eq. (3.3) can be
used to establish a relationship between R and the introduced ∆θ:

The momentum thickness at the end of the considered plate for uncontrolled ﬂow condi-
tions, θ0(x), is a ﬁxed value. For body force damping it holds that vw = 0 such that R
is solely determined by ∆θ. The reduction of a positive ∆θ as discussed above therefore
corresponds to lower values for R for later control placement which is in agreement with
the results shown in Figure 6(e). In the case of constant blowing vw is constant such that
diﬀerences in R can also only arise from changes in ∆θ. The relation therefore suggests
that the reported larger negative ∆θ will also result in smaller R values for later place-
ment, independent of the total length of the plate that is considered. The results shown
in Figure 6(f) conﬁrm that lower R values are indeed found for the later placement.
Actually, the reduction of R is more pronounced for uniform blowing than for body force
damping which is in agreement with the fact that larger changes in θ are introduced.
From Figures 6(e,f) it is evident that the streamwise development of R directly after
the control section can include a positive streamwise gradient (R(cid:48) > 0) before R decays
continuously in the far downstream region: R(cid:48) > 0 is found for body force damping (re-

which reveals that the sign of R(cid:48) depends on the balance of the two terms in the brackets.
In case of body force damping r remains at large positive values over some distance after
the control region yielding a dominance of the ﬁrst term and thus R(cid:48) > 0. For uniform
blowing, the ﬁrst term dominates only when the control region is placed further down-
stream. This dominance disappears eventually and R(cid:48) < 0 is established for x > 2930.
The detailed derivation of Eq. (3.7) and further discussion can be found in Appendix B.

3.5. Estimation of global drag reduction rates achieved by local control

The spatial development of skin friction drag within the control and transient regions
depends on the applied control scheme, and thus has to be evaluated via DNS or exper-
iment. However, it has been shown that the far downstream eﬀect of a control region in
TBL can be characterized by a single quantity, namely ∆xs, which represents a stream-
wise shift of the TBL virtual origin. Therefore, the drag in this fully developed region
can be estimated without relying on DNS or experiments in very large domains.

Once the inﬂuence of drag reducing control on the TBL is reduced to ∆xs the de-
velopment of r and R for the fully developed region can be estimated using empirical
correlations between the skin friction coeﬃcient and the Reynolds number, e.g. based on

(3.8)
The streamwise coordinate x(cid:48) that enters the Reynolds number is the coordinate of the
uncontrolled ﬂow simply corrected by the shift such that x(cid:48) = x∗ + ∆x∗
s, where ∆x∗
is the dimensional representation of ∆xs and x∗ corresponds to the distance from the
virtual origin of the uncontrolled solution. Corresponding results are depicted in Fig-
ure 7. Figure 7(a) and (b) show an excellent agreement between the model adopted for
the fully developed region of the TBL and the DNS data. The estimation can be used
to further extrapolate the results and shows that local and global drag reduction rates
will eventually vanish if long uncontrolled sections after the control region are consid-
ered. Figure 7(c) and (d) present the prediction downstream of the simulation domain
extended up to Rex = 108 for the control regions placed at x0 = 131 and 1870. Utilizing
Equation (3.5) with ∆θ(x = 3000) the streamwise shift introduced by the control region
at x0 = 1870 is estimated to be ∆xs = 147 and −515 for body force damping and uniform
blowing, respectively. Figure 7(c) shows a less pronounced permanent local drag increase
for the body force damping and a higher local drag reduction for the uniform blowing
when control is applied farther downstream. However, for both control schemes higher
integral drag reduction is observed when control is placed closer to the leading edge of
the TBL as discussed in the previous section.

4. Conclusions

The global eﬀect of locally applied skin friction drag reduction in TBL is addressed in
this paper. We deﬁne a global drag reduction rate as an integral quantity that includes
controlled and uncontrolled regions of the ﬂow over a plate of ﬁnite length. In a TBL
DNS two fundamentally diﬀerent drag reducing control schemes are locally applied and
the global drag reducing eﬀect is evaluated with a particular focus on the downstream
development after the control region. Although the control parameters are designed so
that both control methods yield similar drag reduction rate inside the control region, the
downstream development of the wall friction is found to be fundamentally diﬀerent. The
control scheme that attenuates turbulent activity leads to a thinner TBL downstream
of the control region in comparison to the uncontrolled ﬂow and thus yields local drag
increase in this region. In contrast, the control scheme of local uniform blowing thickens
the TBL downstream of local uniform blowing and therefore exhibits persistent drag
reduction.

The present results indicate that in a developing ﬂow any local manipulation inﬂuences
the downstream development via a streamwise shift of the uncontrolled solution. While
the local drag reduction within the control region depends on the type of applied control
and the location at which it is applied, the control eﬀect far downstream of the control
region can be generally expressed by a streamwise shift of the virtual origin of the TBL.
Since the streamwise shift captures the global inﬂuence of the particular control tech-
nique on TBL, the quantity can also be understood as a control performance index for
TBL. The representation of the control eﬀect through one single quantity allows pre-
dicting the drag behavior far downstream of the control without the need of DNS or
experiments in this region. For instance, such prediction enables an estimation of the
distance over which a net drag reducing eﬀect is observed when a large-eddy break-up
device (LEBU) is utilized for TBL control as pointed out by Narasimha & Sreenivasan
(1988). In general, the present results indicate that drag reducing control applied in the
beginning of a TBL has a higher global eﬃciency in term of the suggested integral drag

reduction rate. In addition, it is shown that any local drag reduction eﬀect vanishes from
a global perspective if long uncontrolled sections after the control region are present.

For drag reducing control in TCF the formulation of additional control indices related
to net energy savings or energy eﬃciency of the applied control (Kasagi et al. 2009) is
widely established. Such considerations will also have to be transferred to a global per-
spective for TBL. This is however beyond the scope of the present investigation which is
limited to a global evaluation of skin friction drag reduction since the applied body force
damping is an idealistic control scheme that does not allow for a meaningful determina-
tion of the power required to run the control.

Similar downstream eﬀects like the ones reported here are likely to appear if local
wall roughness is considered. Skin friction drag will increase in the rough region but
downstream of the rough region the increased boundary layer thickness will lead to
lower local skin friction drag such that the global drag change strongly depends on the
combination of rough and smooth regions along the plate.

Finally, it should be noted that for a plate of ﬁnite length the overall drag is not solely
determined by skin friction. The wake of the plate, which depends on the boundary
layer thickness at the trailing edge, will also contribute to the overall ﬂow resistance. In
addition, for aeronautical applications the applied control techniques might also inﬂuence
the lift which is not included in the present consideration.

Appendix A.

A parametric study with variation of control length and blowing amplitude is carried
out in a shorter simulation domain with TBL up to Re θ = 1100. For consistency, the
same xt, x0 and non-dimensionalization based on θ (xt) of the main simulation are used
in the parametric study. As an example, three cases are considered: the base control
conﬁguration from the main simulation with ∆xc = 247 and vw = 0.005U∞, a conﬁgu-
ration with a shorter control length ∆xc/4 and vw = 0.005U∞ and a conﬁguration with
lower blowing amplitude vw = 0.00125U∞ over the same control length ∆xc. The latter

two conﬁgurations exhibit the same bulk blowing. In Figure 8(a) it can be seen that the
shortest control length yields negative r values right after the control region while the
other two remain positive. This eﬀect is presumably associated with the ﬂow adjustment
through a rapid enhancement of turbulent activity when a strong blowing is introduced
over a short area, whereas a longer control area enables a gradual adaptation of the ﬂow
ﬁeld to the introduced blowing so the region with negative r vanishes. Figure 8 (b) shows
the evolution of the momentum thickness for the considered control conﬁgurations. It
is evident that downstream of the control area the TBL is rendered thicker and hence
yields lower skin friction coeﬃcient with corresponding positive local drag reduction for
all cases.

with r (x) as deﬁned in Eq. (2.2)
Since the prefactor of Eq. (B 4) depends only on the properties of uncontrolled ﬂow,
the sign of R(cid:48) (x) is determined by the balance between the two terms in the parenthesis.
Assuming that local drag reduction is achieved in the control section, this balance reveals
that the streamwise gradient of R can be negative (second negative term is dominant) or
positive (ﬁrst term is dominant and positive). The resultant R(cid:48) (x) depends on the control
placement and the particular control type. Due to the fact that [cf ]x,0 monotonically
increases with x by deﬁnition and changes in r (x) and ∆ [cf ]x,0 are minor for diﬀerent
control placements, it is expected that the second term is dominant when the control
is placed closer to the leading edge, while the ﬁrst term is dominant when the control
is placed further downstream. In the case of body force damping, local drag increase is
introduced downstream of the control section (r (x) < 0), so R(cid:48) (x) is always negative
(except the short section close to the control area where r (x) remains positive). On the
other hand, uniform blowing introduces a permanent local drag reduction downstream
of the control section (r (x) > 0) and R(cid:48) (x) tends to be positive, especially when the
control section is placed farther downstream.
