ABSTRACT

We present Clusterrank, a new algorithm for identifying dispersed astrophysi-
cal pulses. Such pulses are commonly detected from Galactic pulsars and rotating
radio transients (RRATs), which are neutron stars with sporadic radio emission.
More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast radio bursts (FRBs)
have been identiﬁed as the potential signature of an extragalactic cataclysmic
radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs. Clusterrank helped us discover
14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo 327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey
(AO327). The new RRATs have DMs in the range 23.5 − 86.6 pc cm−3 and
periods in the range 0.172 − 3.901 s. The new pulsars have DMs in the range
23.6 − 133.3 pc cm−3 and periods in the range 1.249 − 5.012 s, and include two
nullers and a mode-switching object. We estimate an upper limit on the all-
sky FRB rate of 105 day−1 for bursts with a width of 10 ms and ﬂux density
& 83 mJy. The DMs of all new discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin.
In comparing statistics of the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we
ﬁnd that both sets are drawn from the same period distribution. In contrast, we
ﬁnd that the period distribution of the new pulsars is diﬀerent from the period
distributions of canonical pulsars in the ATNF catalog or pulsars found in AO327

data by a periodicity search. This indicates that Clusterrank is a powerful com-
plement to periodicity searches and uncovers a subset of the pulsar population
that has so far been underrepresented in survey results and therefore in Galactic
pulsar population models.

Introduction

The ﬁeld of fast radio transient detection as a means of discovering new radio sources
ﬁrst came to the forefront when McLaughlin et al. (2006) found 11 such transients in archival
Parkes Multibeam Survey data. They were called Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) as
the diﬀerences between pulse arrival times for each object were found to be multiples of one
interval, the rotation period. RRAT rotation periods are on the order of a few hundreds to
a few thousands of milliseconds, consistent with rotating neutron stars. The average RRAT
rotation period is larger than the average normal pulsar rotation period. However, for some
RRATs detected in only one or two observations the published period may be multiples of
the actual period because of the small number of pulses detected. Furthermore, there are
observational selection eﬀects which result in pulsars with longer periods being detected with
higher signal-to-noise in single-pulse searches (McLaughlin et al. 2006).

Unlike normal pulsars, RRATs appear to not be emitting a pulse on every rotation,
as evidenced by the fact that these objects were missed by Fast Fourier Transform-based
periodicity searches. As more RRATs were discovered (see the RRATalog1) and more follow-
up observations accumulated, the diversity in emission patterns has made it increasingly
likely that diﬀerent processes are responsible for the intermittency of what initially appeared
as one new class of radio sources.

Some objects discovered by single-pulse searches are slow pulsars selected against in
surveys with short integration times where there are not enough pulses for a detection to
be made via periodicity search. Some RRATs discovered e.g. at 1.4 GHz appear as normal
pulsars when observed at a lower frequency (Deneva et al. 2009). This is consistent with
the explanation of Weltevrede et al. (2006) that in such cases the intermittency is due to a
pulse intensity distribution with a long high-ﬂux tail, such that as the pulsar ﬂux density
drops oﬀ at higher frequencies, only the brightest pulses remain detectable. RRATs emitting
short sequences of pulses on consecutive rotations may be extreme nullers and/or old pulsars
close to the death line, where the radio emission mechanism gradually begins to turn oﬀ

– 3 –

(Zhang et al. 2007, Burke-Spolaor & Bailes 2010). In other cases, a single pulse or a single
short sequence of pulses is detected and the RRAT is never seen again despite many follow-up
observations (Deneva et al. 2009). These detections are consistent with cataclysmic events
or a mechanism which generates rare conditions in an otherwise quiescent neutron star
magnetosphere. Cordes & Shannon (2008) argue that this emission pattern can be explained
by sporadic accretion of debris from a circumpulsar asteroid belt.

All RRATs known to date have dispersion measures (DMs, the integrated column den-
sity of ionized gas along the line of sight) consistent with a Galactic origin. Lorimer et al.
(2007) reported a 1.4 GHz Parkes detection of a fast radio transient outside of the Galactic
plane with a DM signiﬁcantly exceeding the estimated contribution of Galactic ionized gas
along the line of sight. More Parkes detections of transients with similar properties were made
by Thornton et al. (2013), Petroﬀ et al. (2015), and Ravi, Shannon & Jameson (2015), the
latter from a targeted observation of the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Spitler et al. (2014)
detected a transient with similar properties using Arecibo, also at 1.4 GHz. Apart from their
high DMs, most of these fast radio bursts (FRBs) diﬀer from RRATs in that they are only
detected with one pulse in their discovery observations. Despite many follow-up observations,
so far repeat pulses have been deﬁnitively detected only from the Arecibo FRB (Spitler et al.
2016). The combination of seemingly extragalactic origin and, until recently, the lack of
repeat bursts has suggested cataclysmic events producing a single coherent radio pulse de-
tectable to Gpc distances, such as coalescing neutron stars (Hansen & Lyutikov 2001), evap-
orating black holes (Rees 1977), or collapsing supramassive neutron stars (Falcke & Rezzolla
2014). Dissenting views have attributed FRBs to Galactic ﬂaring stars (Loeb, Shvartzvald & Maoz
2014, Maoz et al. 2015) and atmospheric phenomena (Kulkarni et al. 2014).

Understanding the nature of fast radio transients is important in ﬁguring out how their
progenitors ﬁt into the evolution of our Galaxy and galaxies in general. They may even
provide an independent test of various evolutionary scenarios. For example, if RRATs are
assumed to be intermittent since formation and comprise a neutron star population separate
from normal pulsars, the Galactic core-collapse supernova rate is too low to account for both
populations Keane & Kramer (2008). This is not the case if RRATs represent a stage in
the evolution of pulsars, even though they may outnumber other pulsar types since their
sporadic pulses make them less likely to be discovered by pulsar surveys. All FRBs known
to date have been found at 1.4 GHz even though surveys conducted at 350 MHz with the
Green Bank telescope search DMs up to 1000 pc cm−3 (Karako-Argaman et al. 2015). It is
still unknown whether that is due only to selection eﬀects or has intrinsic causes as well.

In this paper we report the results of running Clusterrank, a new algorithm for identi-
fying astrophysical radio transients, on data collected by the Arecibo 327 MHz Drift Pulsar

– 4 –

Survey (AO327). Section 2 describes the AO327 survey setup and observations, Section 3
gives details on the single-pulse search code whose output Clusterrank operates on, and Sec-
tion 4 focuses on Clusterrank implementation and performance. Sections 5 and 6 present
new pulsars and RRATs, respectively, and Section 8 analyzes the statistics of both types of
discoveries. Finally, Section 9 places limits on the FRB population.

2. AO327 Survey Observations

The AO327 drift survey is running since 2010 during Arecibo telescope downtime or
unassigned time. It aims to search the entire Arecibo sky (declinations from −1◦ to 38◦) for
pulsars and transients at 327 MHz. Phase I of the survey covers declinations from −1◦ to
28◦, and Phase II will cover the remainder of the sky accessible to Arecibo. Under normal
operating conditions, AO327 does not get observing time within ±5◦ from the Galactic plane.
Frequencies higher than 327 MHz are more suitable for pulsar and transient searches within
the Galactic plane because of signiﬁcant dispersion and scattering due to Galactic ionized
gas. However, telescope time occasionally becomes available on short notice due to technical
problems that render regularly scheduled projects unable to observe. AO327 is a ﬁller project
in such cases, and some of its discoveries were made during unscheduled encroachments on
the Galactic plane.

In this paper we present single-pulse search results from analyzing 882 h of data taken
with the Arecibo 327 MHz receiver and the Mock spectrometer backend, up until March
2014, when AO327 began using the newer PUPPI backend. An analysis of PUPPI data
will be presented in a future paper. The eﬀective integration time is Tobs = 60 s for AO327
observations, corresponding to the drift time through the beam at 327 MHz. For Mock
observations, the number of channels is Nch = 1024, the bandwidth is ∆ν = 57 MHz, the
sampling time is dt = 125 µs, the receiver temperature is Trec = 115 K, and the gain is
G = 11 K/Jy.

Figure 1 shows the intrinsic minimum detectable ﬂux density Sint,min vs. DM for AO327
using the Mock spectrometer, for the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey (GBNCC,
Stovall et al. 2014), and for the GBT350 drift survey (Lynch et al. 2013). According to the
radiometer equation applied to single pulse detection (Cordes & McLaughlin 2003)

Sint,min = (cid:18)Wobs

where SNRmin = 6 is the detection threshold, the sky temperature Tsky = 50 K (Haslam et al.
1982) (appropriate for a source out of the Galactic plane), Wint is the intrinsic pulse width,

for each DM range while the increased dispersion smearing is still negligible compared to
scattering broadening.

detailed discussion of AO327 search volume, sensitivity to periodic sources, and comparisons
with other pulsar surveys as well as between the diﬀerent backends that have been used in
AO327 observations.

3. Single-Pulse Search

Data are dedispersed with 6358 trial DMs in the range 0 − 1095 pc cm−3. The spacing
between successive trial DMs increases from 0.02 to 1.0 pc cm−3 such that at high DMs
the smearing due to a pulsar’s actual DM being halfway between two trial DMs is much
smaller than the scattering broadening estimated from the empirical ﬁt of Bhat et al. (2004).
Because scattering broadening dwarfs the sampling time even at moderate DMs, during
dedispersion data are downsampled by a factor that increases as the trial DM increases
(Table 1).

– 6 –

We use the PRESTO2 tool single pulse search.py to search each dedispersed time
series for pulses. Each radio pulse, astrophysical or terrestrial, is typically detected as a
cluster of events above a signal-to-noise threshold at multiple closely spaced trial DMs. We
use the word “event” to refer to such a detection at a single trial DM. The one-dimensional
time series are ﬂattened with a piecewise linear ﬁt where each piece is 1000 bins long. Then
the time series are convolved with a set of boxcar functions with widths ranging from 1 to
300 bins. Because the time series may already have been downsampled during dedispersion,
the same boxcar function may correspond to diﬀerent absolute widths in seconds for diﬀerent
time series. We cap the width of boxcars such that they do not exceed 0.1 s for any time series.
This corresponds to the maximum pulse duration detectable in our search. Observed RRAT
and FRB pulse widths range from a fraction of a millisecond to a few tens of milliseconds3 ,4.
We construct a list of events with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 5 for each time series,
where

SNR = Xi

(Si − S0)
σW 1/2
box

.

(3)

The sum is over successive bins Si covered by the boxcar function, S0 ≈ 0 is the baseline
level after ﬂattening, σ ≈ 1 is the root-mean-square noise after normalization, and Wbox is
the boxcar width in number of bins. This deﬁnition of SNR has the advantage that it gives
approximately the same result regardless of the downsampling factor used for the time series,
as long as the pulse is still resolved. If there are several events with SNR > 5 detected with
boxcars of diﬀerent widths from the same portion of data, only the event with the highest
SNR is retained in the ﬁnal list.

The scattering broadening observed for most known FRBs (DMs ∼ 500−1000 pc cm−3)
is . 1 ms at 1400 MHz. Assuming a Kolmogorov scattering spectrum such that τs ∝ f −4,
this corresponds to a scattering time of ∼ 300 ms at 327 MHz. The widest boxcar template
PRESTO uses for event detection in dedispersed time series is 150 bins. At the maximum
downsampling factor of 64, with our sampling time of 81.92 µs, this corresponds to a template
width of ∼ 800 ms. Assuming an intrinsic pulse width of 5 ms, a 6-σ detection of a pulse
with Wobs = 800 ms corresponds to Sint = 1.5 Jy, and a similar detection of a pulse with
Wobs = 300 ms corresponds to Sint = 0.9 Jy.

The event list produced by PRESTO is used to make plots like Figure 2, which are

then inspected by eye to look for clusters of events indicative of dispersed pulses. Because
the spacing between trial DMs changes signiﬁcantly within the full range of DMs used in
the search (Table 1), single-pulse search plots are made for four subsets of the full range of
trial DMs. AO327 data are processed in 1-minute “beams”, corresponding to the maximum
transit time through the Arecibo beam at 327 MHz. To date, we have processed ∼ 882 h of
Mock drift data, resulting in a total of 423360 single-pulse search plots. Because AO327 is
a blind all-sky survey, the vast majority of these plots contain only events due to Gaussian
noise or radio frequency interference (RFI). Since human inspection of all single-pulse search
plots would require an excessive amount of time, ideally we want this task to be reliably
accomplished by an algorithm able to distinguish astrophysical dispersed pulses from ter-
restrial RFI or noise, in a constantly changing RFI environment. Below we describe such
an algorithm, called Clusterrank, that enabled us to quickly discover 22 new pulsars and
RRATs.

4. Clusterrank

Clusterrank5 operates on the event lists produced by the PRESTO single-pulse search
for a 1-minute span of AO327 drift data. Events are sorted by DM and time and clusters of
events are identiﬁed such that the DM and time gaps between sorted events do not exceed
a threshold. We have set the maximum acceptable DM gap to 1 pc cm−3, the largest
spacing in our trial DM list. We use a maximum acceptable time gap corresponding to the
product of the raw data time resolution and the largest boxcar function width used in the
single-pulse search: 0.125 ms × 150 samples ≈ 19 ms. The minimum number of events
per cluster that would trigger further processing is set to 50. The DM gap, time gap, and
minimum events per cluster are tunable parameters and the values chosen for processing
the AO327 Mock data set strike a balance between detecting as many clusters likely to be
caused by astrophysical pulses as possible and avoiding further processing of the excessive
number of smaller clusters occurring randomly due to Gaussian noise ﬂuctuations. Similar
to PRESTO’s single pulse search.py, Clusterrank considers and plots four separate DM
ranges: 0 − 40 pc cm−3, 30 − 120 pc cm−3, 100 − 500 pc cm−3, and 500 − 1000 pc cm−3.

The determination of how likely a cluster is to indicate the presence of a dispersed pulse
in the data hinges on the analytical expression describing how a pulse’s amplitude in the
dedispersed time series changes as the trial DM varies with respect to the actual pulsar DM.
Cordes & McLaughlin (2003) derive the ratio of the peak ﬂux density of a Gaussian pulse

dedispersed with a DM error δDM to the peak ﬂux density if the same pulse is dedispersed
with no DM error. We substitute event SNR for the peak ﬂux density. The DM error
δDMi = DMi − DMpsr, where the index i refers to an event in the cluster. If SNRpsr is the
pulse SNR for δDM = 0, the resulting equations are

Here ∆νMHz is the bandwidth in MHz, Wms is the observed pulse width in ms, and νGHz
is the center observing frequency in GHz. We perform least-squares ﬁtting using the the
Optimize.leastsq module of SciPy and the recorded SNRs and DMs of the events in a
cluster. The free parameters in the ﬁt are Wms, DMpsr, and SNRpsr. The initial guess values
passed to the least-squares ﬁtting function are 10 ms as the width, and the DM and SNR
of the event with the highest SNR in the cluster.

Due to pulse substructure, noise, as well as the imperfect selection of a best-width
boxcar ﬁlter for pulses with low SNR, in a cluster of events there are often outliers that
signiﬁcantly deviate from the SNR vs.
trial DM dependence predicted by Eqn. 4 and
Eqn. 5. We perform three iterations of identifying outliers, removing them from the cluster,
and redoing the least-squares ﬁt with the remaining events. An event is rejected as an outlier
if |SNR(δDMi)−SNRi| > |SNR(δDMi)−5|/2. The baseline SNR diﬀerence of 5 was chosen
to correspond to the minimum SNR for which events are recorded. In absolute terms, the
rejection criterion is more stringent for events further away in DM from the peak in SNR
vs. DM space. This eﬀectively rejects the ﬂat tails at SNR = 5 exhibited by many clusters.
Figures 3 and 4 show the resulting improvement in the ﬁnal ﬁt for two clusters of events
containing outliers and the eﬀect outliers can have on the quality of the initial ﬁt. The
bottom panels of the two ﬁgures show the sloping signature of the event clusters in time-DM
space. This is due to dispersion under- or overcorrection away from the actual RRAT DM
smearing the pulse and shifting its peak in the dedispersed time series to a later or earlier
time, respectively.

4.1. Test Statistic

As a measure of the goodness of ﬁt for each cluster we use the correlation coeﬃcient for

the ﬁnal ﬁt of the cluster events SNR vs. DM

R2 = 1 − P(cid:16)SNRi − [SNRi(cid:17)2
P(cid:0)SNRi − SNR(cid:1)2 ,

(6)

where SNRi is the i-th event’s SNR, [SNRi is the i-th event’s predicted SNR based on
Eqn. 4, and SNR is the mean SNR for the cluster. The number of events can vary widely
from one cluster to another and we ﬁnd that in this situation R2 is a better test statistic
than the reduced χ2 or the root-mean-square residual from the least-squares ﬁt. Hereafter
we use the term “score” to refer to the R2 value of a cluster.

After all clusters in one of the considered DM ranges are ﬁtted, the highest score for that
DM range and beam is recorded. Plots are viewed in decreasing order of the recorded best
score values. The range of possible values for R2 is from zero (no correlation between cluster
events and ﬁt) to unity (perfect correlation). We ﬁnd that pulses from known pulsars that
would be unambiguously identiﬁed as such on visual inspection when viewed in isolation from
other pulses of the same pulsar are almost always ﬁtted with R2 > 0.9, and the remainder
are ﬁtted with 0.8 < R2 < 0.9. We therefore adopt R2 > 0.8 as the threshold for visual
inspection of plots.

We note that the score is independent of the DM span of the cluster or the magnitude
of event SNRs in the cluster. A weak pulse conforming well to Eqn. 4 will have a better
score than a bright pulse that does not. The score is also independent of the number of
events in the cluster, as long as it is above the minimum required for the cluster to be
ﬁtted. Nor does the score depend on a cluster containing all events generated by the same
pulse, as long as the cluster is well ﬁtted by Eqn. 4. This is the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between Clusterrank and codes like RRATtrap (Karako-Argaman et al. 2015), which rely on
the event with the highest SNR in a cluster to be present near the middle of the DM span
of the cluster. Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the discovery of PSR J0630+19 made via ﬁtting of
two separate clusters corresponding to the two shoulders of a pulse in SNR vs. DM space.

The PRESTO single-pulse search, which constructs the event lists that serve as input
to Clusterrank, by default does not search blocks in the dedispersed time series containing
very bright, broad pulses typical of RFI. This approach is very eﬀective in reducing the
number of recorded events due to terrestrial sources, which can be overwhelming in some
beams. However, this RFI excision scheme sometimes has an unintended eﬀect on bright
astrophysical pulses such that the resulting signature in SNR vs. DM space is two shoulders

– 10 –

with a missing peak in-between. Unlike RRATtrap, the ability of Clusterrank to detect
dispersed pulses is unaﬀected by this, even if the gap in DM is large enough that the two
shoulders are processed as separate clusters.

4.2. RFI Rejection

PRESTO attempts to identify and remove RFI before making the event lists that Clus-
terrank operates on. Narrow-band and impulsive non-dispersed wideband signals are identi-
ﬁed in the raw data and a time-frequency mask is constructed by PRESTO’s tool rfifind.
During dedispersion, values of data points covered by the mask are replaced by a local av-
erage for that frequency channel. The PRESTO single pulse search.py ignores blocks in
the dedispersed time series containing bright, broad pulses, as described above. However,
even after these RFI excision steps, there is still a signiﬁcant number of events due to RFI
in many of the event lists that serve as input to Clusterrank. We identify RFI in several
ways. First, if the ﬁnal ﬁt to a cluster yields a negative best-ﬁt DM or Wms, the score for
that cluster is set to zero. Second, if a cluster is not ﬁt by a negative DM or Wms but the
best-ﬁt DM is less than 1 pc cm−3, the score for that cluster is set to zero. Figures 8 and
9 show two typical clusters with best-ﬁt scores of 0.96 and 0.87 which are identiﬁed as RFI
by these conditions.

A diﬀerent problem is presented by beams that are so contaminated by RFI that there
are tens to hundreds of clusters in one of the four DM ranges considered by Clusterrank.
Since each cluster ﬁt is essentially an independent hypothesis test, a large number of tests
done for events in the same DM range means that the likelihood of at least one false positive
(RFI cluster with score > 0.8) for that beam is high.
In order to mitigate this, we use
a modiﬁcation of the Bonferroni correction to the familywise error rate (Bonferroni 1936).
We divide the best cluster score for each of the four DM ranges considered per beam by the
base-10 logarithm of the number of clusters in that DM range rounded to the nearest integer.
This means that 32 or more clusters in a single DM range would trigger the correction for
that range. A known pulsar with 32 or more pulses within the AO327 integration time of
one minute that are moreover bright enough to be detected in a single-pulse search would be
detected in our concurrent periodicity search. RFI pulses are often bright enough to cover a
large range of DMs, and one genuine dispersed pulse plotted alongside 32 or more RFI pulses
may be diﬃcult to distinguish visually even if all single pulse plots were subjected to human
inspection. Since Clusterrank is geared towards detecting individual pulses, we consider
the Bonferroni correction a good tradeoﬀ for identifying this type of RFI contamination and
excluding plots suﬀering from it from human inspection. On average, 2.7% of plots originally

– 11 –

had R2 > 0.8 but were excluded from human inspection after the Bonferroni correction was
applied to their scores.

4.3. Performance

In order to evaluate the performance of Clusterrank, we need to estimate the false
positive and false negative rates, as well as what fraction of the total single-pulse search
plots are selected for human inspection. Table 2 shows that overall for the Mock portion
of AO327, 1.2% of plots have score > 0.9 and 5.9% have 0.8 < score < 0.9. However, the
percentage of plots with score > 0.9 decreases from 1.9% to 1.1% between 2010 and 2011,
and holds at 1.1% for 2011 − 2013. This is due to the fact that in early 2011, two sources of
RFI in the 327 MHz band were identiﬁed on-site at Arecibo: cameras inside the Gregorian
dome, and the rotation motors of the ALFA multibeam receiver. Subsequently, these were
always disabled before the start of AO327 observing sessions. This decrease is evident for
plots with scores of 0.8 − 0.9 as well.

Table 2 also shows what percentage of plots with score > 0.8 contain a detection of a
known or new pulsar or RRAT. While the fraction of plots with a high score is driven by RFI,
the fraction of high-ranked plots containing a detection is highly dependent on what part of
the sky AO327 was observing in any year. As a low-frequency drift survey, AO327 does not
typically get observing time near the oversubscribed inner Galactic plane. However, AO327
is often the only project that can take advantage of the telescope when it must be stationary
for repairs or maintenance. During such times AO327 accumulates data and known pulsar
detections in that region. The increased rate of detections in 2013 can be attributed to a
lengthy painting job at the telescope platform during daytime in January - March 2013,
coinciding with the time when the inner Galactic plane is above the horizon at Arecibo.

4.3.1. False Positives

While the ideal way to compare the false positive rates of Clusterrank and the RRATtrap
code of Karako-Argaman et al. (2015) is to do it per pulse, the published false positive rate
of RRATtrap is on a per-plot basis. In addition, the eﬃciency of both codes in reducing the
number of plots for human inspection is based on a per-plot score. Therefore, we proceed
by comparing per-plot rates between the two codes.

RRATtrap scores 10% of plots as “excellent” and selects them for human inspection.
Ninety per cent of these plots contain false positives, resulting in an overall false positive rate

of 9%. If we consider Clusterrank plots with score > 0.9, the corresponding false positive
rate is 1% (Table 2). If we consider Clusterrank plots with score > 0.8, the overall false
positive rate is 7%. Clusterrank results are from AO327 and RRATtrap results are from
GBNCC and GBT350. The RFI environment is more challenging at Arecibo, where the
radio-quiet zone around the telescope is smaller. The fact that Clusterrank has a smaller
false positive rate despite that means that it is very eﬀective in distinguishing RFI from
astrophysical pulses.

While 10% of excellent RRATtrap plots contain a detection, 5% of Clusterrank plots
with score > 0.9 do. The AO327 eﬀective integration time and beam area area are 1 minute
and 0.049 deg2, respectively. The integration times of GBNCC and GBT350 are 2 and
2.3 minutes, respectively, while the beam area is 0.28 deg2 for both GBT surveys. The
remaining factor is the volume per unit solid angle searched, which depends on telescope
sensitivity. Adapting the survey volume comparison in Deneva et al. (2013) for single-pulse
detections by using Eqn. 1, we ﬁnd that for a 5 ms pulse VAO327,Mock/VGBNCC ≈ 4.5 and
VAO327,Mock/VGBT350 ≈ 7.5. Assuming that the 10% RRATtrap detection rate is the same
for GBT350 and GBNCC data and normalizing by the product of beam area, integration
time, and volume per unit solid angle, we ﬁnd that Clusterrank makes one detection in 1.14
times the volume per RRATtrap detection in GBT350 data, and in 0.78 times the volume
per RRATtrap detection in GBNCC data.

4.3.2. False Negatives

Clusterrank can produce three types of false negatives. Two are at the level of individual
astrophysical pulses: (1) a pulse resulting in a cluster with < 50 events which is not ﬁtted

– 13 –

and (2) a pulse ﬁtted with a score < 0.8. The third type of false negative is due to the
Bonferroni correction described in Section 4.2 and is at the level of the best cluster score
recorded per DM range per beam which determines whether the respective plot is selected
for human inspection. Precisely determining the rate for the latter type of false negative
would require inspecting the plots that triggered the Bonferroni correction, which comprise
∼ 20% of all plots. By inspecting a random subset of these plots, we estimate that 0.02% of
all plots contain astrophysical pulses with R2 > 0.8 but the best cluster score recorded for
the plot was decreased to < 0.8 due to the Bonferroni correction. The false negatives in the
inspected subset of plots were known pulsars whose high number of pulses within the beam
triggered the correction.

Determining the rates for the ﬁrst two types of false negatives precisely is not possible
without visually inspecting all single-pulse search plots, which is what Clusterrank allows
us to avoid. However, from results for a random set of beams containing known and new
pulsar and RRAT detections we calculate that 2% of astrophysical pulses result in clusters
with < 50 events, which are not ﬁtted by Clusterrank, and 27% of astrophysical pulses have
a best ﬁt with R2 < 0.8, which in the absence of other pulses would not select the plot for
visual inspection. Using the same method, Karako-Argaman et al. (2015) estimate that 20%
of astrophysical pulses are not scored as “excellent” (but may still be marked as “good”) by
RRATtrap, at the expense of also producing more false positives than Clusterrank.

We note that in the case of known pulsars, Clusterrank false negatives tend to occur as
the pulsar enters and exits the beam, or if it traverses only the edge of the beam. As the
pulsar moves away from the beam center, pulse SNR decreases. While R2 does not directly
depend on SNR, the SNR vs. DM shape that Clusterrank is ﬁtting gradually becomes less
pronounced and the pulse is detected at fewer trial DMs.

4.3.3. FRB Considerations

An isolated highly dispersed pulse may be very diﬃcult to distinguish from a noise
cluster of events either algorithmically or visually. Pulsar surveys typically use trial DM
lists with the interval between successive DMs increasing as the trial DM value increases
(Table 1). This is done to maximize computing eﬃciency: the detectability of pulsars with
high DMs is limited by uncorrectable scattering broadening, not dispersion. However, it also
means that an isolated, highly dispersed FRB pulse that is not bright enough to be detected
at a large range of widely spaced DMs would be diﬃcult to impossible to identify visually
or by algorithms like Clusterrank and RRATRap, which rely on the SNR vs. DM shape of
the pulse. Figure 10 shows a simultaneous detection of the known pulsars J1914+0219 (DM

– 14 –

= 233.8 pc cm−3) and J1915+0227 (DM = 192.6 pc cm−3). Most of the two pulsars’ pulses
are not recognized as clusters and would be ﬁtted poorly because they are detected at too
few DMs. In isolation, each of those pulses would be diﬃcult to distinguish from clumps of
noise events elsewhere on the plot.

The spacing between successive trial DMs in the scattering-limited detection regime is
typically informed by the ﬁt of scattering time vs. DM made by Bhat et al. (2004), which is
based on observations of Galactic sources. Unlike Galactic pulsars with DM & 500 pc cm−3,
FRBs exhibit little to no scattering at 1.4 GHz. This can be explained by the fact that
for FRBs, which are seen outside of the plane of our Galaxy, the bulk of the scattering
material is in the host galaxy. For a scattering screen of the same size, the subtended angle
as seen from Earth would be much smaller for the extragalactic source, essentially at the
limit of the scattering screen being a point source. Therefore the diﬀerence in travel time for
unscattered photons vs. photons scattered by the edges of the screen would be much smaller
for an extragalactic than for a Galactic source. Correspondingly, the exponential scattering
tail of the observed pulse caused by the spread of photon travel times due to scattering
would be less prominent or absent for the extragalactic source. For these reasons, in order
to maximize the chance of detecting highly dispersed, non-repeating FRBs, surveys should
deliberately oversample the DM search space at high DMs.

4.3.4. Clusterrank at High Frequencies

In order to evaluate how well Clusterrank performs on data taken at a higher frequency
commonly used in pulsar searching, we located PRESTO single-pulse search output ﬁles for
the discovery observations of eight RRATs6 and one FRB (Spitler et al. 2014) discovered by
the PALFA survey at 1.4 GHz. They were found by human inspection alone or facilitated
by RRATtrap. We ran Clusterrank on each set of ﬁles with no change in the algorithm
or parameter values described above while appropriately specifying the PALFA observing
frequency and bandwidth. The FRB received a score of 0.94. Six of the RRATs received
scores of 0.88 − 0.99. One RRAT was a false negative: its sole pulse resulted in fewer than
50 recorded events and therefore it was not ﬁtted. The latter was the only data set from
the older WAPP backend, which was used by PALFA until 2009. The lower sensitivity of
WAPP vs. Mock PALFA observations means that there are fewer DMs, with larger spacings,
in the trial DM list used to process WAPP data, than is the case for Mock data. Therefore,
single-pulse search output from WAPP data has fewer events per pulse on average, and in

6http://www2.naic.edu/~palfa/newpulsars

– 15 –

that case an adjustment in the minimum number of events per cluster would improve the
performance of Clusterrank.

The observation of one RRAT was severely contaminated by RFI, resulting in > 1000
clusters in the DM range containing the RRAT pulse. While the RRAT pulse received a
score of 0.89, some RFI clusters received a score of 0.99. The high number of RFI clusters
triggered the Bonferroni correction step in our algorithm (Section 4.2), which yielded an
overall score of 0.33 for the DM range containing the RRAT pulse. RFI in the PALFA
bandwidth is dominated by several radars emitting pulses chirped at a variable rate. We
ﬁnd that in this situation the ability of Clusterrank to identify dispersed pulses based only
on their shoulder shape at 327 MHz (Section 4.1) becomes a liability at 1400 MHz. This is
due to the fact that for the same DM range and pulse width, this shape becomes more linear
with increasing frequency and therefore less likely to be uniquely identiﬁed with Eqn. 4
(Cordes & McLaughlin 2003, Figure 4). This can be remedied by rejecting pulses whose
best-ﬁt DM is outside the DM range spanned by the cluster.

5. New Pulsars

Clusterrank has facilitated the discovery of 22 new objects to date. Conﬁrmation ob-
servations for all candidates use the 327 MHz receiver with the PUPPI backend and a 5− 10
minute integration time. Each conﬁrmation observation is dedispersed with a range of DMs
corresponding to the range over which pulses were detected in the discovery. If a period can
be derived from single pulses either in the discovery or conﬁrmation, the time series at the
DM for which the pulse SNR peaks is searched for periodic emission within a narrow range
around that period. If a period cannot be derived or if the narrow search does not detect
periodic emission, we perform a blind acceleration search of the time series. Periodicity
searches of conﬁrmation observations revealed that 14 of our 22 single-pulse discoveries are
long-period pulsars, and Table 3 summarizes their properties. In order to derive the peak ﬂux
density, we use a sky temperature Tsky = 50 K (Haslam et al. 1982). The PUPPI backend
provides a bandwidth of 68 MHz and 2816 channels. The receiver temperature Trec = 115 K
and gain G = 11 K/Jy are the same as for Mock observations. The peak ﬂux density is

Spk =

(Trec + Tsky) SNRprof
G (Npol ∆ν Tobs/Nbin)1/2 ,

(7)

where Nbin is the number of bins in the averaged pulse proﬁle and SNRprof is the peak SNR
of that proﬁle.

The periods of the new pulsars are in the range 1.2−5.0 s, with an average of 2.2 s. Sur-
veys using short integration times and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) periodicity search algo-

– 16 –

rithms select against slow pulsars because there are few pulses per observation (Lazarus et al.
2015), slow pulsars typically have duty cycles on the order of only 1−5% (Kolonko, Gil & Maciesiak
2004), and the pulses occur within a phase window that may be signiﬁcantly wider than
the width of an individual pulse. A Fast Folding periodicity search is more eﬀective than
an FFT search when there are few rotation periods within an observation (Staelin 1969,
Kondratiev et al. 2009). We plan to reprocess AO327 survey data with a Fast Folding search,
which will be sensitive to slow periodic emitters missed by the PRESTO FFT-based period-
icity search that moreover do not emit pulses bright enough to be detected by a single-pulse
search. Exhaustive searches for pulsars that are selected against by most widely used search
algorithms are important for constructing a more complete picture of the period and age
distribution of the Galactic pulsar population and relating these statistics to independent
measures of pulsar formation such as the Galactic supernova rate.

Two more narrowly deﬁned subsets of slow pulsars that are selected against in FFT-
based periodicity searches are also represented in Table 3 and overrepresented among Cluster-
rank discoveries compared to the general pulsar population. PSRs J1749+16 and J1750+07
null for tens of seconds at a time. The individual pulses of PSR J1750+07 have a peak ﬂux
density of up to ∼ 150 mJy and are bright enough to trigger PRESTO’s “bad block” ﬂagging
(Section 4.2), yet its integrated proﬁle peak ﬂux density is only 15.5 mJy because its nulling
fraction is > 50%.

PSR J1941+01 has the highest DM of all AO327 discoveries to date, 133 pc cm−3. It is
a mode-switching pulsar and alternates in a quasi-periodic manner between two states with
distinct pulse shapes and phase windows (Figure 11). In addition, one of the modes exhibits
subpulse drifting. The emission of pulsars with similar properties has been explained by the
carousel model, where emission sub-beams circulate around the magnetic ﬁeld axis, giving
rise to emission patterns that repeat on time scales of many pulse periods as the observer’s
line of sight crosses diﬀerent sub-beam conﬁgurations (e.g. Rankin & Wright 2008). We are
pursuing multi-frequency polarimetric observations of J1941+01 in order to map its emission
region cone in altitude as well as cross-section and defer a more detailed analysis to a separate
paper.

6. New RRATs

Eight of the objects discovered with the help of Clusterrank do not exhibit periodic
emission in follow-up observations and therefore we provisionally classify them as RRATs
(Table 4). We were able to estimate the rotation periods for four RRATs based on the inter-
vals between pulses detected within one observation. In the case of J1603+18, we detected

– 17 –

three pulses emitted on consecutive rotations, separated by intervals of ∼ 0.503 s. For the
remaining four RRATs, the intervals between detected pulses are uneven and signiﬁcantly
longer, and therefore the estimated period may be an integer multiple of the actual rotation
period.

We calculate the peak ﬂux density of the brightest pulse in the discovery observation of

each RRAT from the radiometer equation for single pulses:

Spk =

(Trec + Tsky) SNRpk

(Npol ∆ν W )1/2

,

(8)

where SNRpk is the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the brightest pulse, and W is its full width
at half maximum.

RRAT candidate J0156+04 (Table 4) remains unconﬁrmed. Six conﬁrmation attempts
of 10 minutes each were made using the 327 MHz Arecibo receiver and the PUPPI backend.
J0156+04 exhibits the typical signature of a dispersed pulse with one peak in SNR vs. DM
that is easily ﬁtted by Clusterrank and recognized visually (Figure 2, Figure 3). However,
even the brighter of the two detected pulses is too weak for the dispersion sweep to be visible
in a plot of the raw data in time-frequency space around the pulse arrival time.

The properties of J0156+04, two or more pulses in close succession and consistent non-
detections in multiple follow-up observations, are shared by a small subset of radio transients
detected by virtually every pulsar survey using a single-pulse search. Two recent examples
are J1928+15 (Deneva et al. 2009) and J1336−20 (Karako-Argaman et al. 2015). This type
of transient emission may indicate an object that is dormant or not beamed toward the Earth
and whose magnetosphere is perturbed sporadically by accretion of debris from an asteroid
belt (Cordes & Shannon 2008).

7. Perytons

Two bright signals assigned high scores by Clusterrank were also not detected in follow-
up observations. Further inspection revealed that their sweep in time-frequency space does
not completely conform to the cold-plasma dispersion relation. We classify them as perytons,
terrestrial RFI mimicking a dispersed signal (Burke-Spolaor et al. 2011).

The total follow-up observation time is one hour for peryton P1907+06, and 1.6 h for
peryton P1017+02. P1017+02 (Figure 12, Figure 13) and P1907+06 (Figure 15, Figure 16)
are qualitatively diﬀerent from J0156+04, as well as from any other single-pulse source de-
tected by AO327. They are readily recognized visually since the corresponding clusters of

– 18 –

events have a limited extent in DM and a deﬁnite peak in SNR vs. DM that is consis-
tent between pulses from the same source. However, they exhibit complex substructure and
secondary peaks in SNR vs. DM space. This corresponds to a similarly complex resolved
substructure in each pulse, such that diﬀerent components are aligned and summed at dif-
ferent trial DMs. P1017+02 and P1907+06 also diﬀer from the RRATs in Table 4 in that
they are brighter by an order of magnitude.

Figure 14 shows the time-frequency structure of the brightest peryton pulse, also shown
in Figures 12 and 13. All pulses from P1017+02 and P1907+06 exhibit the same tickmark-
like signature, indicating a chirped signal with an abrupt sign reversal of the chirp rate.
Such signals have also been detected by the GBT350 survey (C. Karako-Argaman, private
communication7) and anecdotal accounts suggest that they may be generated in the process
of shutting down the transmitters of some aircraft.

8. Distributions and Populations

Following the analysis presented by Karako-Argaman et al. (2015), we compare the
properties of Clusterrank discoveries with those of known pulsars and RRATs. The average
period for pulsars found by Clusterrank is 2.2 s. This is larger than the 0.9 s average period
for non-MSP (P > 0.02 s) pulsars from the ATNF catalog8, but similar to the 2.3 s average
period of RRATs with measured periods in the RRATalog9. However, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(K-S) two-sample test between Clusterrank pulsar discoveries and RRATalog objects yields
a p-value of 0.017, suggesting that the two sets are not drawn from the same period dis-
tribution. In contrast, the same type of test between Clusterrank RRAT discoveries with
period estimates and RRATalog objects yields a p-value of 0.93, indicating consistency with
the null hypothesis of the same underlying period distribution for both sets. Of the 115
objects currently in the RRATalog, 85 were discovered by surveys operating at 1400 MHz
and using signiﬁcantly longer integration times than AO327. This suggests that neither the
observing frequency nor the number of rotations within a standard survey observation result
in strong selection eﬀects when we consider the period distribution of RRAT discoveries.
The latter may be explained by the fact that follow-up observations of newly discovered
RRATs are typically longer than the discovery observation and thus slow pulsars discovered
by single-pulse search are likely to be identiﬁed as periodic emitters when reobserved. The

– 19 –

weak dependence on observing frequency is due to the fact that dispersion (∝ ν −2) and
scattering broadening (∝ ν −4) do not signiﬁcantly select against detecting RRATs at 327
vs. 1400 MHz due to their long periods.

Since the DM and spatial distribution of a set of pulsar discoveries depends on what
region of the sky survey observations are targeting, we can meaningfully compare Clusterrank
discoveries only with AO327 periodicity search discoveries. Performing two-sample K-S tests
between these two sets we obtain a p-value of 0.60 for their DM distributions, and p-values
of 0.87 and 0.98 for the Galactic latitude and longitude, respectively. Therefore we can
conclude that Clusterrank discoveries are drawn from the same spatial and DM distribution
as AO327 periodicity search discoveries.

9. FRB Population Limits

We did not ﬁnd any FRBs in the AO327-Mock data set presented in this paper. However,
as we outline in Section 4.3.3, the methods usually employed for calculating the optimal trial
DM list for a pulsar search assume a relationship between dispersion and scattering typical
of Galactic sources that does not hold for known FRBs. We plan to reprocess all AO327
survey data with a trial DM list optimized for detecting highly dispersed but not signiﬁcantly
scattered FRB pulses.

−0.5×104 sky−1 day−1 from high-latitude data, and Burke-Spolaor & Bannister

The ﬁrst upper limits on the all-sky FRB rate are from Parkes pulsar surveys and their
FRB detections. For FRBs with a ﬂux density S & 3 Jy at 1.4 GHz, Thornton et al. (2013)
estimate a rate of 1.0+0.6
(2014) estimate a rate of ∼ 2 × 103 sky−1 day−1 from intermediate- and low-latitude data.
Burke-Spolaor & Bannister (2014) argue that the diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant but
acknowledge that the estimates use assumptions whose validity about FRBs is unknown.
Rane et al. (2015) derive a limit of 3.3+5.0
−2.5 × 103 day−1 sky−1 for bursts with a ﬂux density
> 0.1 Jy at latitudes |b| < 60◦ and argue that this is consistent with rates from other Parkes
surveys. Karako-Argaman et al. (2015), who did not ﬁnd any FRBs in GBT350 drift data,
derive a limit on the rate of bursts with S & 260 mJy and widths ∼ 10 ms at 350 MHz and
obtain ∼ 1 × 104 sky−1 day−1.

We assume that FRBs follow Poisson statistics in order to calculate a similar rate limit
from AO327-Mock sky coverage. The Poisson probability of detecting exactly k FRBs in a
survey of total duration T is

P (X = k) =

(rθT )k e−(rθT )

k!

,

(9)

– 20 –

where θ is the beam area and r is the burst rate. The probability of detecting at least one
FRB is P (X > 0) = 1 − P (X = 0) = 1 − e−(rθT ). We calculate that for a 99% chance of
detecting at least one FRB in the 882 h of AO327-Mock data, the rate is ∼ 1×105 sky−1 day−1
for 10 ms bursts with S & 83 mJy. The limit derived from AO327-Mock is less stringent than
the limits from GBT350 or the Parkes surveys, because AO327-Mock has signiﬁcantly less
total on-sky time and smaller beam size. Since the spectral indices of FRBs are on the whole
unknown, we can meaningfully compare the AO327-Mock limit only with the GBT350 limit.
AO327-Mock searches 5 times more volume per unit time than GBT350 (Deneva et al. 2013,
Figure 4). Therefore, the AO327-Mock FRB rate limit normalized to the GTB350 search
volume is ∼ 2 × 104 sky−1 day−1. This estimate will improve when results from AO327-
PUPPI are included, in addition to results from reprocessing AO327-Mock data with a DM
list tailored for FRB detection.

10. Summary

We have developed Clusterrank, a new algorithm to automatically rank clusters of events
recorded by single-pulse searches based on each cluster’s likelihood of being generated by a
dispersed astrophysical pulse. Clusterrank enabled us to quickly identify 8 RRATs and 14
slow pulsars missed by an FFT-based periodicity search in AO327 drift survey data. The
new RRATs have DMs in the range 22.5 − 86.6 pc cm−3. Five of these sources have period
estimates from pulse arrival times; their periods are in the range 0.172 − 3.901 s. The new
pulsars have DMs in the range 23.6− 133.3 pc cm−3 and periods in the range 1.249− 5.012 s.
We ﬁnd that the periods of RRATs found by Clusterrank are drawn from the same
distribution as the periods of sources in the RRATalog, and that the periods of pulsars and
RRATs discovered by Clusterrank are consistent with having the same underlying distri-
bution. We also ﬁnd that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the underlying DM or
spatial distributions of new sources found by AO327 via periodicity search vs. new sources
found via using Clusterrank on PRESTO single-pulse search output.

Although we search AO327 data with DMs up to 1000 pc cm−3, we have not yet found
any highly dispersed pulses indicative of FRBs. We identify a common optimization in con-
structing trial DMs lists for pulsar surveys that likely hinders the identiﬁcation of such pulses
either visually or algorithmically and recommend that the DM search space be deliberately
oversampled for DM & 500 pc cm−3 compared to what is optimal for Galactic sources.

Fig. 4.— Clusterrank ﬁt for the single pulse in the discovery observation of RRAT J0544+20.
Top: a dashed curve shows the best ﬁt of SNR vs. DM without outlier rejection. A solid
curve shows the best ﬁt after three iterations of identifying outliers, removing them from the
cluster, and redoing the ﬁt. Good points used in the ﬁnal ﬁt are shown in red, and outliers
are shown in black. A vertical line is drawn through the event with the highest SNR, whose
SNR and DM are used as seeds for the initial least-squares ﬁt. There are several outliers at
low SNR close to the best-ﬁt DM, indicating a two-peak pulse shape, with one component
signiﬁcantly weaker than the other. Bottom: the structure of the cluster is shown in DM-time
space.

Fig. 5.— Single-pulse search plot of the discovery observation of PSR J0630+19. Histograms
of the number of events vs. DM (left) and event SNR vs. DM (right). Bottom: Events are
plotted vs. DM and time. Larger marker sizes correspond to higher SNR. Events belonging
to clusters identiﬁed by Clusterrank are shown in red if the cluster R2 > 0.8. In this case, the
pulse yields three clusters of events at t ∼ 35 s, with the cluster corresponding to the peak
in SNR vs. DM space consisting of only two events and therefore not ﬁtted. The discovery
of this pulsar was made based on the ﬁts of the two shoulders of the SNR vs. DM signature
of the pulse, detected as two separate clusters with scores of 0.96 and 0.81 (Figure 6 and
Figure 7). The clusters at DM ∼ 53 pc cm−3, t ∼ 13 and 52 s were not ﬁtted because they
contain too few events. They are unlikely to be pulses from PSR J0630+19 since their DM
deviates signiﬁcantly from the pulsar DM of 48 pc cm−3.

10.— Detection of the known pulsars J1914+0219 (DM = 233.8 pc cm−3) and
Fig.
J1915+0227 (DM = 192.6 pc cm−3) in the same beam. Most pulses are detected at very
few DMs and result in clusters with < 50 events, which excludes them from being ﬁtted by
Clusterrank. However, each of these pulses taken in isolation is diﬃcult to distinguish from
noise clusters elsewhere in the DM vs. time panel, either visually or algorithmically. Events
belonging to clusters identiﬁed by Clusterrank are shown in red if the cluster R2 > 0.8,
magenta if 0.7 < R2 ≤ 0.8, cyan if 0.6 < R2 ≤ 0.7, green if 0.5 < R2 ≤ 0.6, and blue if
R2 ≤ 0.5. (There are no clusters with 0.5 < R2 ≤ 0.6 or R2 ≤ 0.5 in this case.)

R2 is the value for the highest-ranked pulse in the discovery Mock observation. Conﬁrmation
observations with the more sensitive PUPPI backend yielded periodic detections and many
pulses for all objects. Wprof is the full-width, half-maximum width of the folded pulse proﬁle
and Spk is the peak ﬂux density derived from it. Np is the number of pulses in the discovery
observation.

as the ratio of the total number of pulses detected to the total observation time. For objects
that have been detected in only one observation we take this to be an upper limit. The last
