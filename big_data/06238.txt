Abstract

We construct d-dimensional pure simplicial complexes and pseudo-manifolds (with-
out boundary) with n vertices whose combinatorial diameter grows as cdnd−1 for
a constant cd depending only on d, which is the maximum possible growth. More-
over, the constant cd is optimal modulo a singly exponential factor in d. The pure
simplicial complexes improve on a construction of the second author that achieved
cdn2d/3. For pseudo-manifolds without boundary, as far as we know, no construction
with diameter greater than n2 was previously known.

Keywords: Simplicial complex, hyper-graph, pseudo-manifold, diameter, Hirsch
conjecture

1 Introduction

A pure simplicial complex of dimension d−1 (or a (d−1)-complex, for short) is
any family C of d-element subsets of a set V (typically, V = [n] := {1, . . . , n}).
Elements of C are called facets and any subset of a facet is a face 2 . More
precisely, a k-face is a face with k + 1 elements. Faces of dimensions 0, 1, and
d − 2 are called, respectively, vertices, edges and ridges of C. Observe that a
pure (d− 1)-complex is the same as a uniform hypergraph of rank d. Its facets
are called hyperedges in the hypergraph literature.

2 The standard usage is to consider all faces, not only facets, as elements of C, and then
call facets the maximal ones. Our approach is equivalent and, for our purposes, simpler.

The adjacency graph or dual graph of a pure simplicial complex C, denoted
G(C), is the graph having as vertices the facets of C and as edges the pairs
of facets X, Y ∈ C that diﬀer in a single element (that is, those that share
a ridge). Complexes with a connected adjacency graph are called strongly
connected. The combinatorial diameter of C is the diameter, in the graph
theoretic sense, of G(C).

We are interested in how large can the diameter of a pure simplicial com-

plex be in terms of its dimension and number of vertices. For this we set:

Hs(n, d) := maximum diameter of pure strongly connected

(d − 1)-complexes with n vertices.

The function Hs(n, d) is known to be exponential in d:

is contained in [6,
Another construction giving a lower bound of type n
Thm. 4.4]. In this short note we show a simple and (relatively) explicit con-
struction giving
Theorem 1.2 For every d ∈ N there are inﬁnitely many n ∈ N such that:

d

4

Hs(n, d) ≥

nd−1

(d + 2)d−1 − 3.

Observe that this matches the upper bound in Theorem 1.1, modulo a

factor in Θ(d3/2e−d), since d! ≃ e−ddd√2πd.

Remark 1.3 Our proof of Theorem 1.2 uses an arithmetic construction valid
only when the number n of vertices is of the form q(d + 2) for a suﬃciently
large prime power q. But every interval [m, 2m] contains an n of that form,
because there is a power of 2 between m/(d + 2) and m/2(d + 2)). Hence, the
theorem is also valid “for every d and suﬃciently large n”, modulo an extra
factor of 2d−1 in the denominator.

Motivation for this question and relatives of it comes from the Hirsch
Conjecture which, written in the language of simplicial complexes, said: The

maximum diameter of a polytopal simplicial (d−1)-sphere with n vertices can-
not exceed n− d. Here, a simplicial sphere is a pure simplicial complex whose
underlying topological space is homeomorphic to a sphere. A polytopal sphere
is the simplicial complex of proper faces of a simplicial polytope. Although the
original Hirsch conjecture has been disproved [8], the only counter-examples
to it that we know of exceed the conjectured diameter by a small fraction. In
particular, the following polynomial version of the Hirsch conjecture is open,
even in the linear case (the case k = 1):

Conjecture 1.4 (Polynomial Hirsch Conjecture) There are constants c,
k such that the diameter of every polytopal (d − 1)-sphere with n vertices is
bounded above by cnk.

An approach that has been tried often is to generalize the conjecture to
more general complexes than polytopal spheres. Theorem 1.1 shows that gen-
eralizing to arbitrary pure complexes is too much, but it is plausible that
simplicial manifolds still have polynomial diameter. In particular, the poly-
math3 project [5] was devoted to (a more abstract and generalized version
of) the following conjecture, inspired by the results in [4] and which implies
Conjecture 1.4 with k = 2 and c = 1:

Conjecture 1.5 (H¨ahnle, in [5]) The diameter of every normal pure (d −
1)-complex with n vertices is bounded above by dn.

Here a pure simplicial complex C is called normal if every two facets F1
and F2 are connected in G(C) via a path with the property that all facets
in the path contain F1 ∩ F2. Another important class of pure complexes are
pseudo-manifolds without boundary 3 : strongly connected complexes in which
every ridge belongs to exactly two facets. For example, Adler and Dantzig [2]
call normal pseudo-manifolds without boundary abstract polytopes. Here we
prove the following:

Theorem 1.6 For every strongly connected pure (d − 1)-dimensional sim-
plicial complex with n vertices and diameter δ there is a (d − 1)-dimensional
pseudo-manifold without boundary with 2n vertices and diameter at least δ +2.

3 C is a pseudo-manifold with boundary if ridges are contained in at most two facets,
the boundary of C consisting of the ridges lying in only one facet. Standard usage is
to say “pseudo-manifold” alone meaning “without boundary” and “pseudo-manifold with
boundary” when boundary is allowed. But to avoid confusion we here insist in saying
“without boundary” when boundary is forbidden.

Together with Theorem 1.2 this implies the following, where Hpm(n, d) de-
notes the maximum diameter of (d−1)-dimensional pseudo-manifolds without
boundary. As far as we know this is the ﬁrst construction of pseudo-manifolds
without boundary and of exponential diameter.

Corollary 1.7 For every d ∈ N there are inﬁnitely many n ∈ N such that:

Hpm(n, d) ≥

nd−1

(2(d + 2))d−1 − 1.

In a similar spirit, Todd [10] deﬁned semi-duoids as the pure simplicial
complexes in which every ridge lies in an even number of facets, and called
duoids the semi-duoids that do not properly contain other semi-duoids. Semi-
duoids were later called oiks (as a short-hand for “Euler complexes”) by Ed-
monds [3] (see also [11]). One of the results in [10] is the construction of duoids
with quadratic diameter. Since every pseudo-manifold without boundary is a
duoid, Corollary 1.7 signiﬁcantly improves that construction.

2 Proof of Theorem 1.2

Our construction is arithmetic, and uses the following well-known result that
can be found, for example, in [7, Theorem 33.16]:
Theorem 2.1 Let p(x) = xd + a1xd−1 + · · · + ad be a primitive polynomial of
degree d over the ﬁeld Fq with q elements, for some d ∈ N and some prime
power q. Consider the sequence (un)n∈N deﬁned by the linear recurrence

un+d + a1un+d−1 + · · · + adun = 0,

starting with any non-zero vector (u1, . . . , ud) ∈ Fd
qd − 1. In particular, its intervals of length d cover all of Fd

q . Then, (un)n∈N has period
q \ {(0, . . . , 0)}.

That is:

(cid:8)(ui, . . . , ui+d−1) : i ∈ {1, . . . , qd − 1}(cid:9) = Fd

q \ {(0, . . . , 0)}.

Remember that a primitive polynomial of degree d is the minimal polyno-
mial of a primitive element in the degree d extension F
qd of Fd. The number of
monic primitive polynomials of degree d over Fq equals φ(qd − 1)/d, since F
qd
has φ(qd−1) primitive elements, and each primitive polynomial is the minimal
polynomial of d of them. In our construction we will need the coeﬃcients of
p(x) to be all diﬀerent from zero. Primitive polynomials with this property

do not exist for all q, but they exist when q is suﬃciently large with respect
to d, which is enough for our purposes:
Lemma 2.2 For every ﬁxed d ∈ N and every suﬃciently large prime power q,
there is a primitive polynomial of degree d over Fq with all coeﬃcients diﬀerent
form zero.

Proof. This follows from the fact that the number of primitive monic poly-
nomials of degree d is greater than the number of monic polynomials of degree
d with at least one zero coeﬃcient, for q large.

Indeed, the latter is qd − (q − 1)d ≤ dqd−1. The former equals φ(qd − 1)/d,
which is greater than (qd − 1)1−ǫ/d, for every 0 < ǫ < 1 and suﬃciently large
q. Letting ǫ = 1

d2 we get:

✷

With this we can now show our ﬁrst construction proving Theorem 1.2.
Theorem 2.3 Suppose that p(x) ∈ Fq[x] is a primitive polynomial of degree
d − 1 with no zero coeﬃcients. Then, there is a pure simplicial complex C of
(d+2)d−1 − 1 facets
dimension d − 1, with n = (d + 2)q vertices and at least
whose dual graph is a cycle.

nd−1

Proof. Our set of vertices is V = Fq × [d + 2]. That is, we have as vertices
the elements of Fq but each comes in d + 2 diﬀerent “colors”. In the sequence
(ui)i∈N of Theorem 2.1 we color its terms cyclically. That is, call

vi = (ui, n mod (d + 2)).

Let C be the simplicial complex consisting of the intervals of length d in the
sequence (vi)i∈N. That is, we let:

Fi = {vi, . . . , vi+d−1},

C = (cid:8)Fi : i ∈ {1, . . . , qd − 1}(cid:9) .

Observe that the sequence {Fi}i∈N is periodic of period lcm{qd − 1, d + 2} ≥
qd − 1 = nd−1
(d+2)d−1 − 1. Also, by construction, G(C) contains a Hamiltonian
cycle. We claim that, in fact, G(C) equals that cycle.

For this, observe that ridges in C are of two types: some are of the form
{vi, . . . , vi+d−2} and some are of the form {vi, . . . , vj, vj+2, . . . , vi+d−1}. We will
study the facets that these types of ridges may belong to.

For a ridge R = {vi, . . . , vi+d−2} to be contained in a facet F we need the
color of the vertex in F \ R to be either i − 1 or i + d − 1 (modulo d + 2).
Once we have the color c of the new vertex v = (u, c) ∈ F\R, the recurrence
relation (and the fact that p has non-zero coeﬃcients) gives us only one choice
for u. Thus, R is only contained in the two contiguous facets Fi−1 and Fi.

The same argument applies to a ridge {vi, . . . , vj, vj+2, . . . , vi+d−1}. Now
the color of the new vertex must be j+1 mod d+2 and the recurrence relation
implies the vertex to be precisely vj+1.
✷

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Delete a facet in the complex C of Theorem 2.3. ✷

A complex whose dual graph is a path, such as the one in this proof, is
called a corridor in [9]. It is a general fact that the maximum diameter Hs(n, d)
is always attained at a corridor ([9, Corollary 2.7]). That is to say, Hs(n, d)
equals the maximum length of an induced path in the Johnson graph Jn,d: the
dual graph of the complete complex of dimension d−1 with n vertices. Induced
paths in graphs are sometimes called snakes. In this language Theorem 1.2
can be restated as:

Theorem 2.4 There is a constant c > 0 such that for every ﬁxed d and
suﬃciently large n the Johnson graph Jn,d contains snakes passing through a
fraction c−d of its vertices.

A stronger statement is known for the graph of a d-dimensional hypercube:
it contains snakes passing through a positive, independent of d, fraction of the
vertices [1].

3 Proof of Theorem 1.6

Let C be the simplicial complex in the statement and V its vertex set. By [9,
Corollary 2.7] there is no loss of generality in assuming that C is a corridor.
That is, its dual graph is a path, so its facets come with a natural order
F0. . . . , Fδ.

We now construct a simplicial complex C ′ in the vertex set V ′ = V ×{1, 2}.
For a vertex v ∈ V we denote v1 and v2 the two copies of it in V ′, and refer to
the superscripts as “colors”. Let ai and bi be the unique vertices in Fi \ Fi+1
and Fi\ Fi−1, respectively. (For F0 and Fδ we choose a0 and bδ arbitrarily, but
diﬀerent from b0 and aδ). We deﬁne C ′ as the complex containing, for each
Fi, the 2d−1 colored versions of it in which ai and bi have the same color. The
diameter of C ′ is at least the same as that of C. Let us see that C ′ is almost

a pseudo-manifold:

• If a ridge R in C ′ is obtained from a colored version of Fi by removing a
vertex v diﬀerent from ai or bi, then the only other facet containing R is
the copy of Fi in which the color of v is changed to the opposite one. This
is so because the “uncolored” version of R is a ridge of only the facet Fi of
C, by assumption.

• If a ridge R in C ′ is obtained from a colored version of Fi (i < δ) by removing
ai then the only other facet containing R is obtained by adding to it the
vertex bi+1 with the same color as ai+1 has in R.

• Similarly, if a ridge R in C ′ is obtained from a colored version of Fi (i > 0)
by removing bi then the only other facet containing R is obtained by adding
to it the vertex ai−1 with the same color as bi−1 has in R.

That is, the only ridges of C ′ that do not satisfy the pseudo-manifold
property are the 2d−1 colored versions of R1 := F0 \ {b0} and the 2d−1 colored
versions of R2 := Fδ \ {aδ}, which form two (d − 2)-spheres, (each with the
combinatorics of a cross-polytope). Choose a vertex a in R1 and a vertex
b ∈ R2, diﬀerent from one another (which can be done since R1 6= R2).
Consider the complex C ′′ obtained from C ′ adding to it all the colored versions
of R1 \ a joined to {a1, a2} and all the colored versions of R2 \ b joined to
{b1, b2}. The eﬀect of this is glueing two (d − 1)-balls with boundary the two
(d− 2)-spheres we wanted to get rid oﬀ, so that C ′′ is now a pseudo-manifold.
(Observe that the new ridges introduced in C ′′ all contain either {a1, a2} or
{b1, b2} so they were not already in C ′).
Remark 3.1 In some contexts it may be useful to apply Theorem 1.6 to
closed corridors, that is, pure complexes whose dual graph is a cycle. The
construction in the proof works exactly the same except now C ′ is already a
pseudo-manifold, with no need to glue two additional balls to it as we did in
the ﬁnal step of the proof.
