Individual Microscopic Results Of Bottleneck
Experiments

Marek Buk´aˇcek and Pavel Hrab´ak and Milan Krb´alek

Abstract This contribution provides microscopic experimental study of pedestrian
motion in front of the bottleneck, explains the high variance of individual travel time
by the statistical analysis of trajectories. The analysis shows that this heterogeneity
increases with increasing occupancy. Some participants were able to reach lower
travel time due more efﬁcient path selection and more aggressive behavior within the
crowd. Based on this observations, linear model predicting travel time with respect
to the aggressiveness of pedestrian is proposed.

1 Experiment

Various experiments have been conducted in order to verify crowd behavior models
and to enable fundamental research of pedestrians phenomena [6, 9, 7, 8].

Advanced processing of video records provides microscopic analysis of individ-
ual behavior [2, 4]. During critical situation, the individual behavior plays important
role – less aggressive pedestrians spend more time in monitored area, which may
cause unexpected complications.

This article is based on egress experiment organized in Czech Technical Univer-
sity. Group of 75 students passes through artiﬁcial room (Fig. 1), instructed to leave
the area as fast as possible, to avoid running and pushing each other. The results
supported phase transition study mentioned in [1, 3].

Tree entrances were controlled by trafﬁc lights to get demanded trafﬁc mode
inside the experimental area, see Table 1. To simulate random inﬂow conditions,
green light was alternated by k · ∆h seconds of red light, where k was generated
from geometric distribution and ∆h = 0.6 s was the time step. Each round started
with empty room.

Fig. 1 Left: schema of organized experiment. The distance from the entrance to the exit a = 7.2 m
(considered for measuring of travel time), room width 4.5 m and exit width 0.6 m. Right: snapshot
from exit camera.

Unique codes on the hats of participant enabled to detect and identify trajectory
of each participant. From this information, travel time (covering the period from
entrance to exit) and Voronoi density were extracted for further investigation.

2 Travel Time Analysis

As mentioned in [1], recorded travel time signiﬁcantly depends on the occupancy
N(t), deﬁned as number of pedestrians inside the room. Travel time increases lin-
early with occupancy and the variance is increasing as well, see Figure 2 below.
This phenomenon will be described by pedestrian’s individual characteristics.

The term trajectory is understood to be the set of time-space coordinates assigned

to one participant during one of his passings

xi = (xi(t),yi(t),t),

where xi(t) and yi(t) are coordinates of paths i in time t. Here we note that the path
identiﬁer i does not refer to any speciﬁc participant, but to the recorded trajectory.

Travel time of trajectory i is deﬁned as the time spent in the room, i.e.

T T (i) = Tout(i)− Tin(i),

where the Tin and Tout is measured just behind entrances, resp in front of the exit,
see Figure 1.

The occupancy in the room N(t) was derived from paths, this quantity was used

to determine mean occupancy N(i) for each path i: as

(cid:90) Tout(i)

N(i) =

T T (i)

mean and quantiles evaluated for given occupancy.

2.1 Relative travel time

To compare the travel times measured under different conditions (stable state was
not reached for whole experiment), scaling based on mean occupancy was intro-
duced. For each occupancy bin (N − 1,N(cid:105) the mean travel time T TN was deﬁned
as

(cid:8)T T (i) | N(i) ∈ (N − 1,N](cid:9) .

T TN = mean

i

Then the relative travel time for each path may be evaluated as

T T (i)

,

that enable to compare Travel time of paths reached under different conditions.

To underline the increase of variance in travel time, two histograms of relative
travel time are plotted in Figure 3. As you can see, the travel time of dominant
majority of passings in free ﬂow did not deviate more than 20% from the mean
value. On the other hand, the travel time in congested mode covered area from 50%
to 200% of T TN.

areas.

2.2 Paths and Paths Density

Paths selection is one of the features, which affect reached travel time. Following
study summarizes the space usage described by paths density. The workload W of
space element A j is deﬁned as

W (A j) = |(cid:8)i : ∃t ∈ xi : (x(t),y(t) ∈ A j

(cid:9)| ,

where A j is an area deﬁned by rectangular grid, 0.2 m × 0.2 m.

Both trajectory and workload were evaluated in area in front of the bottleneck,
the visualization is provided in Figure 4. In the following the terms slow and fast
trajectories refer to set of 20% higher, resp lower travel time. These trajectories are
compared under meta-stable and congested phase of the system, several conclusions
were drawn:
• the direct path to the exit was used more by fast trajectories,
• the area at the wall was used by fast paths,
• slow paths observed mainly along the angle 45deg to the exit,
• observed asymmetry - fast on left, slow on right.

metastable cluster and congested crowd. For both trafﬁc modes, trajectories of slow and fast pedes-
trians were compared. Here we note that the density was evaluated on a grid 0.2 m × 0.2 m, each
trajectory contributed to any segment maximally ones. The darker color, the higher workload.

2.3 Individual approach

More detail study may be provided adding the pedestrian’s identiﬁcation. Here we
will use the Greek letters to denote identiﬁed participants.

While some participants reached similar travel time in free ﬂow and congested
mode, the others were not able to pass through the dense crowd and spent incompa-
rable more time in the room.

To compare participants, individual relative travel time was deﬁned as

T T α = mean

i

{T TR(i) | i ∈ Iα} ,

where Iα is the set of paths assigned to pedestrian α.

The histograms of T T α for free ﬂow and congested state are visualized in Fig-
ure 5. As you can see, the heterogeneity among participants corresponds well to the
variance of relative travel time introduced in Fig. 3.

Thanks to participant identiﬁcation it is possible to highlight records correspond-
ing to given pedestrian in the travel time – occupancy diagram (Figure 6). The ob-
servations show the same heterogeneity measured by individual relative travel time.
While some participant were not affected much by crowd, some were not able to
reach the exit through crowded area.

To compare the ability to push through the crowd, we deﬁne the pedestrian at-

tribute aggressiveness as the slope of piece-wise linear model

different strategies were highlighted and piece-wise linear model is illustrated.

T T (iα ) =

S
v0

+ 1{N(iα )>7}(N(iα )− 7)· slope(iα ) + noise.

The factor (N > 7) speciﬁes the mode, where is one pedestrian affected by motion
of others. Until the N < 7, the free phase is observed and therefore the interactions
may be neglected.

Comparing to classic linear model T T (iα ) = S
v0

+ N(iα ), piece-wise model ﬁts
the data much better mainly in free ﬂow area, where the travel time obviously does
not depend on occupancy. Vice versa, the area of constant TT trend does not affect
the slope modeled in crowded area, see Figure 7.

Mean value of residuals in both models are similar (see Table 2), the lower value

of mean R2 for piece-wise model corresponds to the facts mentioned above.

ipants, standard and piece-wise linear model are compared.

At the end, the path density was investigated with respect to individual behav-
ior, see Figure 8. The observed trends are similar to the conclusions drafted from
anonymous paths data.

To conclude this part, observed variance is successfully explained by differences
in individual behavior. Pedestrians hold to their different strategies which leads to
different performances.

3 Conclusions

Even it was shown that lover travel time was reached by faster trajectories, the paths
selection itself would not imply fast passing. Fast paths were not shorter or better
curved to reach low travel time from physical point of view. But this paths were
more effective to get through the dense crowd.

To support this idea, we found out many tokens of aggressive behavior from the
camera records as pushing, rude overtaking or blocking each other. The concept of
aggressiveness as a feature of pedestrian ﬁts this idea well. This is supported by the
fact that some individuals reached low travel time under all conditions while others
were very sensitive to occupancy.

The effect of heterogeneity has dramatic inﬂuence to the progress of evacuation.
The time spent in dangerous area may be in mean value sufﬁciently low according to

local guidelines, but there is a high probability that some part of pedestrians would
stay there for much longer. This effect was implemented to the cellular automata
model, see [5].
