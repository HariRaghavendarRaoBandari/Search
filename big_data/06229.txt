ON SEMIBOUNDED TOEPLITZ OPERATORS

D. R. YAFAEV

Abstract. We show that a semibounded Toeplitz quadratic form is closable in the
space ℓ2(Z+) if and only if its matrix elemens are Fourier coeﬃcients of an absolutely
continuous measure. We also describe the domain of the corresponding closed form.
This allows us to deﬁne semibounded Toeplitz operators under minimal assumptions
on their matrix elements.

1. Introduction. Main results

1.1. Toeplitz operators T can formally be deﬁned in the space ℓ2(Z+) of sequences

g = (g0, g1, . . .) by the formula

(T g)n =

tn−mgm, n = 0, 1, . . . .

(1.1)

∞Xm=0

Thus the matrix elements of a Toeplitz operator depend on the diﬀerence of indices
only. So it is natural to expect that properties of Toeplitz operators are close to those
of convolution operators acting in the space ℓ2(Z).

The precise deﬁnition of the operator T requires some accuracy. Let D ⊂ ℓ2(Z+)
be the dense set of sequences g = {gn}n∈Z+ with only a ﬁnite number of non-zero
If the sequence t = {tn}n∈Z ∈ ℓ2(Z), then for g ∈ D sequence (1.1)

belongs to ℓ2(Z+). In this case the operator T is deﬁned on D, and it is symmetric if
tn = t−n. Without any a priori assumptions on tn, only the quadratic form

t[g, g] = Xn,m≥0

tn−mgm¯gn

(1.2)

is well deﬁned for g ∈ D.
The theory of Toeplitz operators is a very well developed subject. We refer to the
books [3] and [6] (Chapter XII), [13] (Chapters B.4 and B.6), [14] (Chapter 3) for basic
information on this theory.

A necessary and suﬃcient condition for a Toeplitz operator T to be bounded was
found by A. Brown and P. R. Halmos. Below dm is always the normalized Lebesgue
measure on T.

Theorem 1.1. [4] A Toeplitz operator T (deﬁned, possibly, via its quadratic form (1.2))
is bounded if and only if tn are the Fourier coeﬃcients of some bounded function on
the unit circle T:

tn =ZT

z−nw(z)dm(z),

n ∈ Z, w ∈ L∞(T; dm).

(1.3)

However the results on unbounded operators are very scarce. We can mention only
the paper [8] by P. Hartman and the recent survey [16] by D. Sarason; see also references
in these articles.

1.2. In this paper, we consider semibounded Toeplitz operators in the ℓ2(Z+). We
always suppose that tn = t−n so that the quadratic form (1.2) is real and assume that

t[g, g] ≥ γkgk2

ℓ2(Z+),

g ∈ D,

kgk = kgkℓ2(Z+),

(1.4)
for some γ ∈ R. In this case, we are tempted to deﬁne T as a self-adjoint operator
corresponding to the quadratic form t[g, g]. Such an operator exists if the form t[g, g]
is closable in the space ℓ2(Z+), but as is well known this is not always true (see Exam-
ple 2.1, below). We refer to the book [2] for basic information concerning these notions;
they are also brieﬂy discussed in subs. 2.1. We recall that, by deﬁnition, the operator
corresponding to the form t[g, g] + δkgk2 is given by the equality Tδ = T + δI (observe
that the identity operator I is a Toeplitz operator). Also by deﬁnition, if a form t[g, g]
is closable, then all forms t[g, g] + δkgk2 are closable. Therefore we can suppose that
the number γ in (1.4) is positive; for deﬁniteness, we choose γ = 1.
We proceed from the following well known result (see, e.g., §5.1 of the book [1]) that

is a consequence of the F. Riesz-Herglotz theorem.

Theorem 1.2. The condition

Xn,m≥0

tn−mgm¯gn ≥ 0,

∀g ∈ D,

(1.5)

is satisﬁed if and only if there exists a non-negative (ﬁnite) measure dM(z) on the unit
circle T such that the coeﬃcients tn admit the representations

tn =ZT

z−ndM(z),

n ∈ Z.

(1.6)

Equations (1.6) for the measure dM(z) are known as the trigonometric moment
problem. Of course their solution is unique. Note that for the Lebesgue measure dm(z)
we have t0 = 1 and tn = 0 for n 6= 0. Therefore the measure corresponding to the
form t[g, g] + δkgk2 equals dM(z) + δdm(z). So we have the one-to-one correspondence
between Toeplitz quadratic forms satisfying estimate (1.4) and real measures satisfying
the condition M(X) ≥ γm(X) for all Borelian sets X ⊂ T.
closable. The answer to this question is strikingly simple.

Our goal is to ﬁnd necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the form t[g, g] to be

Theorem 1.3. Let the form t[g, g] be given by formula (1.2) on elements g ∈ D, and
let the condition (1.4) be satisﬁed. Then the form t[g, g] is closable in the space ℓ2(Z+)
if and only if the equations (1.6) are satisﬁed with an absolutely continuous measure
dM(z).

Of course Theorem 1.3 means that dM(z) = w(z)dm(z) where w ∈ L1(T; dm) and

w(z) ≥ γ. Thus Theorem 1.3 extends Theorem 1.1 to semibounded operators.

1.3. The proof of Theorem 1.3 will be given in the next section. The closure of the

form t[g, g] is described in Theorem 2.10.

The discussion of these results as well as their comparaison with similar statements
for Hankel operators are postponed until Section 3. We also explain there shortly how
our results extend to vectorial Toeplitz operators.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.3

2.1. Let t[g, g] be a quadratic form deﬁned on a set D dense in a Hilbert space H
and satisfying inequality (1.4) where kgk is the norm of g ∈ H. Suppose that γ = 1,
If D[t] can be realized as a subset of ℓ2(Z+), then one says that t[g, g] is closable in the
space H; it means that the conditions

consider the norm kgkT =pt[g, g] and introduce the closure D[t] of D in this norm.

kg(k)k → 0

and kg(k) − g(l)kT → 0

It is easy to see that if T0 is a symmetric

as k, l → ∞ imply that kg(k)kT → 0.
semibounded operator on D, then the form t[g, g] = (g, T0g) is closable.
If the form t[g, g] is closable, then D[t] ⊂ H is a closed set with respect to the norm
k · kT . In this case t[g, g] is deﬁned by continuity on all g ∈ D[t], and one says that
the form t[g, g] is closed on D[t]. For a closed form there exists a unique self-adjoint
operator T such that T ≥ I and

satisfying inequality (1.4) with γ = 1. Deﬁne the sequence g(k) ∈ D by the equalities
g(k)
n = k−1 for 0 ≤ n < k and g(k)
n = 0 for n ≥ k. Then kg(k)k = k−1/2 → 0 as

t[g, g] = k

Toeplitz quadratic forms (1.2).

We are going to use these general deﬁnitions for the space H = ℓ2(Z+) and the
Of course quadratic forms, in particular, the Toeplitz forms, are not necessarily

closable.
Example 2.1. Let tn = 1 for all n ∈ Z. Adding the term kgk2, we obtain the form

Nevertheless kg(k)kT ≥ 1.

n = 1, we have kg(k) − g(l)kT = kg(k) − g(l)k → 0 as k, l → ∞.

Note that the measure dM(z) corresponding to the sequence tn = 1, ∀n ∈ Z, is
supported by the point 1 ∈ T: M({1}) = 1, M(T \ {1}) = 0.
On the other hand, we have the following simple assertion.

Lemma 2.2. If a sequence {tn}n∈Z ∈ ℓ2(Z), then the form (1.2) is closable.
Proof. Now we have t[g, g] = (g, T0g) where the symmetric operator T0 is deﬁned by
formula (1.1) on the set D.
(cid:3)

2.2. As was already mentioned, by the proof of Theorem 1.3 we may suppose that
estimate (1.4) is true for γ = 1. According to Theorem 1.2 the equations (1.6) are
satisﬁed with a measure dM(z) such that M(X) ≥ m(X) for all Borelian sets X ⊂ T;
in particular, the measure dM(z) is positive.
Our proof relies on the following auxiliary construction. Let L2(T; dM) be the space

of functions u(z) on T with the norm

kukL2(T;dM ) =sZT |u(z)|2dM(z).

We put

(Ag)(z) =

∞Xn=0

gnzn

(2.1)

and observe that Ag ∈ L2(T; dM) for all g ∈ D. Therefore we can deﬁne an operator
A : ℓ2(Z+) → L2(T; dM) on domain D(A) = D by the formula Ag = Ag. In view of
equations (1.6) the form (1.2) can be written as

t[g, g] = Xn,m≥0ZT

z−n+mdM(z)gmgn =ZT |(Ag)(z)|2dM(z) = kAgk2

L2(T;dM ),

g ∈ D.
(2.2)

This yields the following result.
Lemma 2.3. The form t[g, g] deﬁned on D is closable in the space ℓ2(Z+) if and only
if the operator A : ℓ2(Z+) → L2(T; dM) deﬁned on the domain D(A) = D is closable.
Our next goal is to construct the adjoint operator A∗. Observe that for an arbitrary

u ∈ L2(T; dM), all the integrals

ZT

u(z)z−ndM(z) =: un, n ∈ Z+,

(2.3)

are absolutely convergent and the sequence {un}∞
L2(T; dM) the set of all u ∈ L2(T; dM) such that {un}∞

n=0 ∈ ℓ2(Z+).

n=0 is bounded. We denote by D∗ ⊂

Lemma 2.4. The operator A∗ is given by the equality

(A∗u)n =ZT

u(z)z−ndM(z),

n ∈ Z+,

(2.4)

on the domain D(A∗) = D∗.
Proof. Obviously, for all g ∈ D and all u ∈ L2(T; dM), we have he equality

(Ag, u)L2(T;dM ) =ZT

∞Xn=0

∞Xn=0

gnznu(z)dM(z) =

gn ¯un

(2.5)

where the sequence un is deﬁned by relation (2.3). If u ∈ D∗, then the right-hand side
here equals (g, A∗u). It follows that D∗ ⊂ D(A∗).

Conversely, if u ∈ D(A∗), then

|(Ag, u)L2(T;dM )| = |(g, A∗u)ℓ2(Z+)| ≤ kA∗ukℓ2(Z+) kgkℓ2(Z+)

for all g ∈ D. Therefore it follows from equality (2.5) that

∞Xn=0

(cid:12)(cid:12)

gn ¯un(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ kA∗ukℓ2(Z+)kgkℓ2(Z+),

∀g ∈ D.

Since D is dense in ℓ2(Z+), we see that {un}∞
D(A∗) ⊂ D∗.

n=0 ∈ ℓ2(Z+), and hence u ∈ D∗. Thus

(cid:3)

Recall

that an operator A is closable if and only if

its adjoint operator
A∗ : L2(T; dM) → ℓ2(Z+) is densely deﬁned. Below clos D∗ is the closure of the set
D∗ in the space L2(T; dM). So we have obtained an intermediary result.
Lemma 2.5. The operator A and the form t[g, g] are closable if and only if

closD∗ = L2(T; dM).

(2.6)

2.3. Next, we use the Riesz Brothers theorem. We state it in a slightly more general

form than in most textbooks.

Theorem 2.6. For a complex (ﬁnite) measure dµ(z) on the unit circle T, put

and suppose that

Then the measure dµ(z) is absolutely continuous.

Indeed, in view of (2.7) the function

z−ndµ(z)

bµ(n) =ZT
bµ(n) ∈ ℓ2(Z+).
∞Xn=0bµ(n)zn

f (z) :=

(2.8)

6

D. R. YAFAEV

belongs to L2(T; dm). Let us consider an auxiliary measure

dµ0(z) = dµ(z) − f (z)dm(z),

(2.9)

and let

bµ0(n) =bµ(n) −ZT

z−nf (z)dm(z), n ∈ Z+,

be its Fourier coeﬃcients. It follows from (2.8) thatbµ0(n) = 0 for all n ≥ 0. So, by the

standard version of the Riesz Brothers theorem (see, e.g., [9], Chapters 4), the measure
dµ0(z) is absolutely continuous.
In view of (2.9), the same is true for the measure
dµ(z).

The following assertion is almost obvious.

Lemma 2.7. Suppose that a set D∗ satisﬁes condition (2.6). Let the measures
u(z)dM(z) be absolutely continuous for all u ∈ D∗. Then the measure dM(z) is also
absolutely continuous.

Proof. Denote by 1X the characteristic function of a Borelian set X ⊂ T. It follows
from (2.6) that there exists a sequence un ∈ D∗ such that
n→∞kun − 1XkL2(T;dM ) = 0
lim

and hence

n→∞ZX

lim

un(z)dM(z) =ZX

dM(z) = M(X).

If m(X) = 0 and the measures un(z)dM(z) are absolutely continuous, then the inte-
grals in the left-hand side are zeros so that M(X) = 0.
(cid:3)

Now it is easy to conclude the “only if ” part of Theorem 1.3. Suppose that the form
t[g, g] is closable. Then by Lemma 2.5 the condition (2.6) is satisﬁed. By the deﬁnition
of the set D∗, the Fourier coeﬃcients of the measures µ(z) = u(z)dM(z) belong to
ℓ2(Z+). Therefore it follows from Theorem 2.6 that these measures are absolutely
continuous for all u ∈ D∗. Hence by Lemma 2.7 the measure dM(z) is also absolutely
continuous.

2.4. It remains to check the converse statement. Let us consider an auxiliary form

t[g, g] = Xn,m∈Z

tn−mgm¯gn

(2.10)

in the space ℓ2(Z) on the set D of sequences g = {gn}n∈Z with only a ﬁnite number of
non-zero components. It is supposed that the coeﬃcients tn are given by formula (1.6).
Let the operator A : ℓ2(Z) → L2(T; dM) be deﬁned (cf. (2.1)) by the formula

zngn =: f (z), D(A) = D.

(2.11)

(Ag)(z) =Xn∈Z

ON SEMIBOUNDED TOEPLITZ OPERATORS

7

Quite similarly to (2.2), we ﬁnd that for g ∈ D,

t[g, g] =ZT |(Ag)(z)|2dM(z) = kAgk2

L2(T;dM ).

(2.12)

If condition (1.5) is satisﬁed, then according to Theorem 1.2 the measure dM(z) is
non-negative and hence t[g, g] ≥ 0 for all g ∈ D. Of course, it is easy to give also a
direct, not using Theorem 1.2, proof of this fact.
For the completeness of our presentation, let us check that the measure dM(z) is
absolutely continuous if the form t[g, g] is closable. This can be done similarly to the
proof in the previous subsection of the same fact for the form t[g, g], but now Riesz
Brothers theorem is not needed. We again suppose that inequality (1.4) holds with
γ = 1; then M(X) ≥ m(X) for all X ⊂ T. Now n ∈ Z in all formulas. The operator
A∗ : L2(T; dM) → ℓ2(Z) acts again by the formula (2.4), and it is deﬁned on the set
D∗ of all u ∈ L2(T; dM) such that A∗u ∈ ℓ2(Z). This means that u ∈ D∗ if and only
if u(z)dM(z) = ϕ(z)dm(z) for some ϕ ∈ L2(T; dm). Now Lemma 2.7 implies that the
measure dM(z) is absolutely continuous.
Next, we show that, for absolutely continuous measures dM(z) = w(z)dm(z) where

w ∈ L1(T; dm), the forms t[g, g] are closable. It follows from (2.12) that

t[g, g] = s[Ag, Ag]

where

s[f, f ] =ZT

w(z)|f (z)|2dm(z).

(2.13)

Since the operator A : ℓ2(Z) → L2(T; dm) is unitary, the form t[g, g] deﬁned on D is
closable in ℓ2(Z) if and only if the form s[f, f ] deﬁned on quasi-polynomials (2.11) is
closable in L2(T; dm). Clearly, s[f, f ] is the quadratic form of the operator of multi-

plication by pw(z). So it is closable because √w ∈ L2(T; dm). Moreover, s[f, f ] is

closed on the set of all f ∈ L2(T; dm) such the integral (2.13) is ﬁnite.

Let us summarize the results obtained for the form t[g, g].

Proposition 2.8. Let the form t[g, g] be deﬁned by the equality (2.10) in the space ℓ2(Z)
on the set D of sequences {gn}n∈Z with only a ﬁnite number of non-zero components.
Let inequality (1.4) hold, and let the measure dM(z) be deﬁned by the relation (1.6).
Then the form t[g, g] is closable if and only if dM(z) = w(z)dm(z) for some w ∈ L1(T),
w(z) ≥ γ. In this case the closure of t[g, g] is given by relations (2.11), (2.12) on the
set of all sequences {gn}n∈Z such that the integral (2.12) is ﬁnite.

2.5. Let us return to Theorem 1.3. Obviously, if the form t[g, g] is closable in the
space ℓ2(Z), then the same is true for the form t[g, g] in the space ℓ2(Z+). So if the
measure dM(z) is absolutely continuous, then by Proposition 2.8 both forms t[g, g]
and t[g, g] are closable. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.3.

Remark 2.9.

(i) For the proof of Theorem 1.3 we used only the “if ” part of Proposi-
tion 2.8. On the other hand, the “only if ” part of Proposition 2.8 is a consequence
of the “only if ” part of Theorem 1.3 proven in subs. 2.3.

(ii) Comparing Theorem 1.3 and Proposition 2.8, we see that if the form t[g, g] is
closable, then the same is true for the form t[g, g]. As was already noted, the
converse assertion is evident.

2.6. We now suppose that dM(z) = w(z)dm(z) where w ∈ L1(T; dm) and w(z) ≥ 1
so that the form t[g, g] is closable in the space ℓ2(Z+). To describe its closure, we
need a mild additional assumption on w(z). We suppose that the function w(z) is a
Muckenhoupt weight; see, e.g., §B 5.7 of the book [13] for various deﬁnitions of this
notion. One of them is given by the condition

m(X)−2ZX

w(z)dm(z)ZX

sup
X⊂T

w(z)−1dm(z) < ∞

(2.14)

on the set D[t] of all g ∈ ℓ2(Z+) such that the right-hand side of (2.15) is ﬁnite.
Proof. Observe that the operator A : ℓ2(Z+) → H 2(T; dm) is unitary and AD =: P
consists of all polynomials (2.1). Let closP be the closure of P in L2(T; dM). So the
assertion of Theorem 2.10 is equivalent to the equality

closP = H 2(T; dm) ∩ L2(T; dM).

(2.16)
Since the convergence in L2(T; dM) is stronger than that in L2(T; dm), we have
closP ⊂ H 2(T; dm) and therefore the left-hand side of (2.16) is contained in its right-
hand side.
It remains to prove the opposite inclusion. If u ∈ L2(T; dM), then there exists a
sequence uk ∈ L∞(T; dM) such that uk → u in L2(T; dM) as k → ∞. By the Weier-
(the sum consists of a ﬁnite number of terms) in L∞(T; dm) and hence in L2(T; wdm).
This yields a sequence of quasi-polynomials fk(z) such that

strass theorem, every uk can be approximated by quasi-polynomials f (z) =Pn∈Z anzn

lim
k→∞ku − fkkL2(T;dM ) = 0,

dM = wdm.

where X runs over all subarcs of T. Let P+ be the orthogonal projection of L2(T; dm)
onto the Hardy class H 2(T; dm) of functions analytic in the unit disc. The operator
P+ : L2(T; dM) → L2(T; dM) is bounded if and only if w(z) is a Muckenhoupt weight.
Recall that the operator A is deﬁned by formula (2.1). Obviously, Ag ∈ H 2(T; dm)
for all g ∈ ℓ2(Z+).
Theorem 2.10. Let the coeﬃcients tn be given by formula (1.6) where dM(z) =
w(z)dm(z), w ∈ L1(T; dm) and w(z) ≥ 1. Suppose that w(z) is a Muckenhoupt weight.
Then the closure of the form t[g, g] deﬁned on D by (1.2) is given by the equality

t[g, g] =ZT |(Ag)(z)|2dM(z)

(2.15)

ON SEMIBOUNDED TOEPLITZ OPERATORS

Since w(z) is a Muckenhoupt weight, this implies that

lim
k→∞kP+u − P+fkkL2(T;dM ) = 0.

So if u = P+u and ϕk = P+fk ∈ P, then ϕk → u as k → ∞ in L2(T; dM) which also
implies the convergence in H 2(T; dm).

(cid:3)

Remark 2.11. Recall that the operator A was deﬁned by formula (2.1) on the domain
D(A) = D. Of course its closure clos A = A∗∗. Let Amax be given by the formula
Amaxg = Ag on the domain D(Amax) that consists of all g ∈ ℓ2(Z+) such that Ag ∈
L2(T; dM). Then the assertion of Theorem 2.10 is equivalent to the equality

clos A = Amax.

3. Discussion

3.1. Let us state a consequence of Theorem 1.3 in terms of matrix elements tn of

the form (1.2).

Proposition 3.1. Suppose that the condition (1.5) is satisﬁed. If the form t[g, g] is
closable in the space ℓ2(Z+), then tn → 0 as |n| → ∞. If {tn}n∈Z ∈ ℓ2(Z), then the
form t[g, g] is closable in the space ℓ2(Z+).

Proof. If the form t[g, g] is closable, then, by Theorem 1.3, the measure dM(z) in
the representation (1.6) is absolutely continuous. Therefore its Fourier coeﬃcients
tn → 0 as |n| → ∞. Conversely, if {tn}n∈Z ∈ ℓ2(Z), then dM(z) = w(z)dm(z) with
w ∈ L2(T; dm). Therefore, again by Theorem 1.3, the form t[g, g] is closable (this
result was already stated in Lemma 2.2).

(cid:3)

There is an important gap between necessary and suﬃcient conditions in Proposi-
tion 3.1. Apparently it cannot be signiﬁcantly reduced. Recall that by the Wiener
theorem (see, e.g., Theorem XI.114 in [15]), if the Fourier coeﬃcients tn of some mea-
sure dM(z) tend to zero, then this measure is necessarily continuous, but it may be
singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

Astonishingly, the condition {tn}n∈Z ∈ ℓ2(Z) of the absolute continuity of the mea-
sure dM(z) turns out to be very sharp. Indeed, for every l ∈ Z+, O. S. Ivaˇs¨ev-Musatov
constructed in [10] a singular measure such that its Fourier coeﬃcients satisfy the
estimate

tn = O(cid:0)(n ln n ln ln n· · · ln(l) n)−1/2(cid:1)

(here ln(l) n means that the logarithm is applied l times to n). Examples of singular
continuous measures of such type go back to D. E. Menchoﬀ [11]. A comprehensive
survey of various constructions of singular continuous measures with decaying Fourier
coeﬃcients can be found in [5].

Thus the condition tn → 0 as |n| → ∞ does not imply that the measure dM(z)
deﬁned by (1.6) is absolutely continuous. Therefore in accordance with Theorem 1.3
the corresponding Toeplitz quadratic form t[g, g] may be unclosable.

10

3.2. There is a certain parallelism between theories of Toeplitz and Hankel operators.
For example, the criteria of boundedness of Toeplitz and of Hankel operators due to
Brown and Halmos [4] (see Theorem 1.1) and to Nehari [12], respectively, look formally
similar. Toeplitz quadratic forms are linked to the trigonometric moment problem while
Hankel quadratic forms are linked to the power moment problem. The following result
obtained by Hamburger in [7] plays the role of Theorem 1.2.

Theorem 3.2. The condition

q[g, g] = Xn,m≥0

qn+mgm¯gn ≥ 0,

∀g ∈ D,

(3.1)

is satisﬁed if and only if there exists a non-negative measure dM(x) on R such that the
coeﬃcients qn admit the representations

qn =Z ∞

−∞

xndM(x),

∀n = 0, 1, . . . .

(3.2)

It is interesting to compare Theorem 1.3 with the corresponding results for Hankel
operators. Let us state necessary and suﬃcient conditions guaranteeing that a Hankel
quadratic form is closable.

Theorem 3.3. [18] Let assumption (1.5) be satisﬁed. Then the following conditions
are equivalent:
(i) The form q[g, g] deﬁned on D is closable in the space ℓ2(Z+).
(ii) The matrix elements qn → 0 as n → ∞.
(iii) The measure dM(x) deﬁned by equations (3.2) satisﬁes the condition

M(R \ (−1, 1)) = 0

(to put it diﬀerently, supp M ⊂ [−1, 1] and M({−1}) = M({1}) = 0).

necessary and suﬃcient for a Hankel quadratic form (3.1) to be closable.

Thus in contrast to Toeplitz quadratic forms, the condition qn → 0 as n → ∞ is
For Hankel quadratic forms, an analogue of Theorem 2.10 is true without additional

assumptions on the measure dM(x), but its proof requires a substantial work.

3.3. Theorem 1.3 automatically extends to vectorial Hankel operators. In this case
g = {gn}n∈Z+ where gn are elements of some auxiliary Hilbert space N, and tn are
bounded operators in N. We now suppose that tn = t∗

−n and

t[g, g] = Xn,m≥0

htn−mgm, gniN ≥ γkgk2

L2(Z+;N),

∀g ∈ D.

(3.3)

The vectorial version of Theorem 1.2 means that inequality (3.3) for γ = 0 is equivalent
to the representation (1.6) with a non-negative operator valued measure dM(z). Let
us state a generalization of Theorem 1.3 to the vector case.

Theorem 3.4. Let the condition (3.3) be satisﬁed. Then the form t[g, g] is closable in
the space ℓ2(Z+; N) if and only if

tn =ZT

z−nW (z)dm(z),

n ∈ Z,

(3.4)

where W ∈ L1(T, dm; N) and W (z) ≥ γIN.

Theorem 2.10 and its proof also extend to the vectorial case provided the projector P+
is a bounded operator in the space L2(T, W dm; N). Note that there is a necessary and
suﬃcient condition (see the paper [17]) of the boundedness of this operator generalizing
the scalar condition (2.14); the result of [17] requires however that dim N < ∞.
