Gluino Coannihilation and Observability of Gluinos at LHC RUN II

Pran Nath∗ and Andrew B. Spisak†

Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115-5000, USA

March 17, 2016

Abstract: The observability of a gluino at LHC RUN II is analyzed for the case where the gluino
lies in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region and the mass gap between the gluino and the
neutralino is small. The analysis is carried out under the Higgs boson mass constraint and the
constraint of dark matter relic density consistent with the WMAP and Planck experiment. It is
shown that in this case a gluino with mass much smaller than the current lower limit of ∼ 1500 GeV
as given by LHC RUN II at 3.2 fb−1 of integrated luminosity would have escaped detection. The
analysis is done using the signal regions used by the ATLAS Collaboration where an optimization
of signal regions was carried out to determine the best regions for gluino discovery in the gluino-
neutralino coannihilation region. It is shown that under the Higgs boson mass constraint and the
relic density constraint, a gluino mass of ∼ 700 GeV would require 14 fb−1 of integrated luminosity
for discovery and a gluino of mass ∼ 1250 GeV would require 3400 fb−1 of integrated luminosity
for discovery at LHC RUN II. An analysis of dark matter for this case is also given. It is found that
for the range of gluino masses considered, the neutralino mass lies within less than 100 GeV of the
gluino mass. Thus a measurement of the gluino mass in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region
will provide a determination of the neutralino mass. In this region the neutralino is dominantly a
gaugino and the spin-independent proton-neutralino cross section is small but much larger than the
neutrino ﬂoor lying in the range ∼ (1 − 10) × 10−47 cm2. Thus a signiﬁcant part of the parameter
space of the model will lie within the reach of the next generation LUX-ZEPLIN dark matter
experiment.

Introduction

The fact that sparticles have not been observed so far appears to imply that the scale of weak scale
supersymmetry (SUSY) is higher than previously thought, lying in the several TeV region. This
reasoning receives support from the observation that the Higgs boson [1–3] mass measurements give
a mass of ∼ 126 GeV, [4, 5] while in supersymmetry the tree-level Higgs boson mass must lie below
the mass of the Z boson. Thus the extra mass must arise from loop corrections, which then requires
that the SUSY scale be in the several-TeV region [6, 7]. However, softly broken supersymmetry
has more than one mass scale and a look at the loop correction indicates that the SUSY scale that
enters is the third generation mass. Speciﬁcally, the gaugino masses are largely unconstrained and

their scale could be much lower, allowing their early discovery. On the other hand, LHC data also
appears to put signiﬁcantly high limits, i.e. above 1.5 TeV, for the gluino mass [8].

In this work we show that in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region, gluino masses lower than
1 TeV would have escaped detection at LHC RUN I and also in the analyses at LHC RUN II based
on the accumulated integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb−1. [8]. Speciﬁcally we carry out an analysis
in the framework of a high-scale supergravity grand uniﬁed model [9] with radiative breaking
of the electroweak symmetry (for a reviews see [10]). The supergravity uniﬁed models admit a
large landscape for sparticle masses [11] which allows for low mass gluinos [11–14] and speciﬁcally
sparticle landscapes where the gluino is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The
largeness of the sparticle landscape arises due the fact that one may have non-universal supergravity
models [15–17].

We investigate the sparticle spectrum in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region under the Higgs
boson mass constraints and the relic density constraint. In these models the universal scalar mass
is taken to be high, lying in the several TeV region, but with low-lying gluino masses. Models
we consider allow for radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry and lie on the hyperbolic
branch, [18] where large scalar masses can arise with low ﬁne tuning. A number of works have
analyzed these SUGRA models [19–25].

Here we consider the possibility that if the ﬁrst and second generation GUT scale gaugino masses
m1 = m2 are high while the third-generation gaugino mass m3 is low, there can exist light gluinos
with masses close to the LSP mass that have evaded detection at the LHC so far, and may yet be
discoverable at LHC RUN II. Coannihilation of a light gluino with mass near the LSP neutralino
provides a mechanism for achieving a dark matter relic density consistent with experimental con-
straints from WMAP [26] and Planck [27]. The analysis shows that in the gluino-neutralino coan-
nihilation region, gluino masses in the range 700–1300 Gev exist consistent with Higgs boson mass
constraint and relic density constraint and would have escaped detection so far, but would be acces-
sible at LHC RUN II with up to 3000 fb−1 of integrated luminosity. A search for signal regions for
the discovery of the gluino in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region was carried out. For each
model point seven signal regions as listed by the ATLAS Collaboration [8] and displayed in table
1 were analyzed. In this table, HT is deﬁned as the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of all
jets, Meﬀ(incl.) is deﬁned as the scalar sum of Emiss
and the transverse momentum of all jets with
pT > 50 GeV, while Meﬀ(Nj) is the scalar sum of Emiss
and the transverse momentum of the ﬁrst
N jets. Each signal region is deﬁned by up to 12 diﬀerent cuts which are on jet PT ’s, Emiss
, etc.,
which are meant to reduce the background and enhance the signal. It is found that over the entire
gluino mass region analyzed, the optimum signal regions are 2jl and 2jm (using the nomenclature
of ATLAS [8]) where 2jl and 2jm are as deﬁned in table 1.

The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows: In section 2 we examine the parameter space of
models with coannihilation of a light (< 2 TeV) gluino with the LSP under the constraints of the
Higgs boson mass, WMAP and Planck relic density, and LHC RUN I exclusions on the sparticle
mass spectra. In section 3 we carry out a signature analysis of a subset of benchmark model points
for LHC RUN II. For these we analyze the seven signal regions of table 1 and determine the leading
and the subleading signal regions and the minimum integrated luminosity for LHC discovery for
each of the model points analyzed. This allows us to determine the range of gluino masses which
would have escaped detection thus far but would be accessible at LHC RUN II with up to 3000 fb−1
of integrated luminosity. We also compare to the latest constraints from ATLAS [8] using simpliﬁed
models with 3.2 fb−1 of integrated luminosity for the 13 TeV data. In section 3.3 we carryout a
signal region optimization. In section 4 we investigate the direct detection of dark matter for the

2

benchmark points of section 3. Conclusions are given in section 5.

2 Parameter Space for Gluino Coannihilation in Non-Universal

SUGRA

As mentioned in section 1, non-universal supergravity models allow for the possibility of non-
universalities in the gaugino masses. In this work we consider this possibility by assuming that the
scalar masses are all universal at high scale but the gaugino masses are split, i.e., gaugino masses
in the U (1) and SU (2) sectors are equal, while the SU (3)C gaugino mass is not. Speciﬁcally we
assume the following parameter space for the model:

m0, A0, m1 = m2 (cid:54)= m3, tan β, sgn(µ)

(1)

where m0 is the universal scalar mass, m1 = m2 are the ﬁrst and second generation gaugino masses,
m3 is the third generation gaugino mass, A0 is the universal trilinear scalar coupling (all at the
grand uniﬁcation scale) and tan β = (cid:104)H2(cid:105)/(cid:104)H1(cid:105), where H2 gives mass to the up quarks and H1 gives
mass to the down quarks and the leptons, and sgn(µ) is the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter
which enters in the superpotential in the term µH1H2. Using the above parameter space the
sparticle spectrum is generated using SoftSusy 3.5.1 [28] while the analysis of the relic density
is done using Micromegas 4.1.7 [29] and SLHA-format data ﬁles are processed using PySLHA [30].

We wish to examine the region of gluino-neutralino coannihilation which requires that the gluino
be the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). In high scale models this can be achieved
by letting m3 lie signiﬁcantly lower than the common scale m1 = m2, as shown in table 2. Thus in
table 2 we list several models which are chosen as illustrative examples. In generating the parameter
set of table 2 we have imposed the constraints that the Higgs boson mass obey mh = 125 ± 2 GeV
and Ωh2 = 0.11 ± 0.013 consistent with WMAP and Planck experiments. The ranges are chosen
to take account of possible errors in theoretical computations given by codes.

?? shows that the gluino mass lies close to the neutralino mass with their mass diﬀerence lying in
the range of ∼ (70 − 100) GeV and the gluino mass being around 1.1× the neutralino mass over
essentially the entire gluino mass range. It is also to be noted that the scale of m0 is high, lying in
the several TeV region, while the light stop mass lies in the range between 2-3 TeV. The largeness
of the third generation scalar masses is what provides a large loop correction to the Higgs boson
to lift its tree value to the desired experimentally-observed value. The reason for the selection of
the illustrative models of table 2 as noted earlier is the following: As discussed in section 3 all of
the models in table 2 would have escaped detection at LHC RUN I but would be observable at
LHC RUN II.

3 Signal Analysis for Gluino-Neutralino Coannihilation Models at

LHC RUN-II

After applying the Higgs boson and the relic density constraints to the gluino-neutralino coanni-
hilation region, a set of benchmark points was selected for a Monte Carlo analysis of LHC signal
regions (see table 2). This analysis was performed with the MadGraph 2.2.2 [31–33] software sys-
tem. First, the Feynman diagrams were calculated for all possible decays of the form p p → SUSY

points calculated by SoftSUSY, as well as the decay widths and branching ratios calculated by
SDECAY [34, 35] and HDECAY [36, 37] operating within SUSY-HIT 1.5 [38], MadEvent was used to
simulate 50,000 MSSM decay events for each benchmark point. Hadronization of resultant parti-
cles is handled by Pythia 6.4.28 [39], and ATLAS detector simulation and event reconstruction
is performed by Delphes 3.1.2 [40]. A large set of search analyses were performed on the gener-
ated events for each benchmark point. The analyses used ROOT 5.34.21 [41] to implement search
region details for the recently published 2-6 jet plus missing transverse energy signal search regions
at 13 TeV [8], which look speciﬁcally for light squarks and gluons.

To allow comparison to the background, all of the signal region analyses were applied to pre-
generated backgrounds published by the SNOWMASS group [42]. For each benchmark point, a
calculated implied luminosity allowed direct comparison to the backgrounds. Each individual back-
ground process from the SNOWMASS background set was scaled by its own implied luminosity and
combined to determine a total background count for each signal region. Fig. 1 displays distributions

In general, events with gauge bosons and SM Higgs bosons in the ﬁnal state are grouped into a
single “boson” (B) category. Thus, for example, the data set “Bjj-vbf” represents production via

vector boson fusion of a gauge boson or a Higgs with at least two additional light-quark jets.

3.1 LHC Production and Signal Deﬁnitions

The multi-jet search strategy described in [8] deﬁnes seven signal regions are deﬁned with jet mul-
tiplicities ranging from 2 to 6 jets with cuts on the inclusive eﬀective mass Meﬀ (incl.) varying from
“loose” (low Meﬀ (incl.)) to “tight” (high Meﬀ (incl.)). When examining the results for the gluino
coannihilation benchmark points, 2jm and 2jl were found to be the dominant and subdominant
signal regions for discovery.

√
Using the techniques and signal regions described above, we analyzed each of the benchmark points
of table 2 to identify a signal region of minimum required luminosity for 5σ signal/
background
discovery of this point at the LHC RUN II. These results can be directly compared to the results
of [8] for simpliﬁed models involving gluinos and neutralinos with decoupled squarks. In that anal-
ysis it was found that for such a simpliﬁed model, using 3.2 fb−1 of data on the same signal regions
to detect the same gluino decay channel (˜g → q ¯q ˜χ0
1), a gluino mass lower limit of ∼ 1500 GeV is
established for neutralino masses up to ∼ 800 GeV. For LSP masses above this, no exclusion is
established at 3.2 fb−1 for any gluino masses, demonstrating that the gluino-neutralino coannihi-
lation region remains viable for continued searching.

3.2 Discussion of results

In table 3 we give an analysis of the SUSY production cross sections, which for the gluino-
neutralino coannihilation models considered here is essentially limited to gluino pair production.
The main mechanisms for gluino production are gluon fusion gg → ˜g˜g and q ¯q → ˜g˜g. Because of
the small mass gap between the gluino and neutralino masses needed for gluino-neutralino coan-
nihilation, the decay of the gluino is dominated by three-body decay involving a neutralino and
quarks, i.e. by the process ˜g → q ¯q ˜χ0
1 which is typically only
a few percent with the decay mode ˜g → q ¯q ˜χ0
1 being as as much as 95% or more over most of the
parameter space, as can be seen in table 3 by adding the two columns on the right.

1. The subleading decay is ˜g → g ˜χ0

√

Using the signal regions deﬁned in [8], it is found (see table 4 and table 5) that the two leading signal
regions for the detection of the decay of the gluino for the gluino-neutralino coannihilation models
are 2jl and 2jm over the entire range of gluino masses given in table 2. Speciﬁcally, in table 5
we present a grid where the ratio signal/
background for each of the Model (i) - (vii) for the
seven signal regions is exhibited for an integrated luminosity suﬃcient for the discovery of the
corresponding model.
It is seen that for Model (i) 2jl is the discovery signal region while for
Models (ii)-(vii), 2jm is the signal region for discovery. All other signal regions lie signiﬁcantly
below the threshold. Since for each signal region up to 12 kinematical variables with cuts are
utilized, it is of interest to analyze in further detail as to the most sensitive of these kinematical
quantities that allow us to discriminate the signal over the background. It is found that among
the twelve kinematical variables, three stand out as the most sensitive for our analysis. These are

In the sparticle landscape this is the mass hierarchy labeled NUSP14 in the nomenclature of [12].
This hierarchy is a useful guide to what one may expect in this class of models. In the left panel
of ﬁg. 3 we exhibit the 2jl signal region for this model, where we plot the number of SUSY signal
events (red) and the square root of the total standard model background (blue) vs. MEf f . The
analysis is done for LHC RUN II at an integrated luminosity of 14 fb−1. Similar analyses are given
in the middle panel of ﬁg. 3 for Emiss
HT . Very similar
analyses were carried out for Models (ii), (vi), and (vii) in ﬁg. 4, ﬁg. 5, and ﬁg. 6. Here, however,
the leading signal region is 2jm and the analyses are done at an integrated luminosity of 66 fb−1
for Model (ii) in ﬁg. 4, at 2000 fb−1 for Model (vi) in ﬁg. 5, and at 3400 fb−1 for Model (vii) in
ﬁg. 6. In each of these cases the SUSY signal meets the 5σ limit needed for discovery. A tabulation

The analysis of ﬁg. 3, ﬁg. 4, ﬁg. 5, ﬁg. 6 and of table 4 shows the remarkable reduction in the po-
tential of LHC RUN II for the discovery of gluino if the gluino mass lies in gluino-neutralino coan-
nihilation region. A further illustration of this result is given in ﬁg. 7 where the largest gluino mass
discoverable as a function of the integrated luminosity at LHC RUN II is given if the gluino mass
lies in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region. Speciﬁcally one ﬁnds that even with ∼ 3000 fb−1
of integrated luminosity LHC RUN II will probe a gluino mass of ∼ 1200 GeV in this case. In con-
trast away from the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region, the discovery potential of LHC RUN II
increases in a dramatic fashion as illustrated by the red dot in the upper left hand corner of ﬁg. 7,

which is taken from the ATLAS analysis [8] using 3.2 fb−1 of integrated luminosity at LHC RUN II.
Thus the analysis of ﬁg. 7 shows that if the gluino mass lies in the gluino-neutralino coannihila-
tion region, its mass could be much smaller than the currents lower limits, where the mass gap
between the gluino mass and the neutralino mass is large.

Figure 7: Integrated luminosity required at LHC RUN II for 5σ discovery of gluino in the gluino-
neutralino coannihilation region as a function of the gluino mass. For comparison ATLAS result
from [8] using simpliﬁed models is also exhibited. One ﬁnds that the exclusion limit for the gluino
mass in the coannihilation region is much lower than the ATLAS result.

Figure 8: Integrated luminosity required at LHC RUN II for 5σ discovery of a gluino in the gluino-
neutralino coannihilation as a function of tan β for each of the Models (i)-(vii). The dependence
of the integrated luminosity required for 5σ discovery is seen to have only a mild dependence on
tan β.

3.3 Signal Region Optimization

Because the signal regions as deﬁned in [8] are for generic simpliﬁed model light gluinos, it is
advantageous to consider whether the signals can be improved upon by altering cuts to one or
several of the variables in table 4. It was found that very modest reduction (between 2 and 10
percent) in integrated luminosity required for 5σ discovery can be achieved in the 2jm signal
region by altering the cut on the variable Emiss
HT . To demonstrate this choice, ﬁgure 9 shows
the results of the 2jm signal region in Models (i), (ii), (vi), and (vii) prior to any cuts on Emiss
HT ,
at the required integrated luminosity for discovery for that model.

By analyzing these ﬁgures, the original choice to require Emiss

shown to be a very good choice, as this is the point where the SUSY signal (in red) overtakes the
square root of the SM background (in blue). However, some improvement can be made by also

4 Gluino Coannihilation, LHC and Direct Detection of CDM

We discuss now further details of the gluino-neutralino coannihilation model. For the case when
the gluino is the NLSP the processes that enter in coannihilation are

˜χ0 ˜χ0 → SM , ˜χ0˜g → SM(cid:48) , ˜g˜g → SM(cid:48)(cid:48) ,

(4)
where SM, SM(cid:48), SM(cid:48)(cid:48) stand for Standard Model states. In the analysis of coannihilation the mass
gap between the LSP and the NLSP plays a critical role. Thus in general for processes ˜χi ˜χj → SM
the coannihilation is controlled by the ratio δi [43–45]

δi =

neq
i
neq =

(cid:80)

gi(1 + ∆i)3/2e−∆ix
j gj(1 + ∆j)3/2e−∆j x ,

(5)

where gi are the degrees of freedom of χi, x = m1/T and ∆i = (mi − m1)/m1, with m1 deﬁned as
the LSP mass and where e−∆ix is the Boltzmann suppression factor. The relic density involves the
integral

Jxf =

x−2(cid:104)σeﬀ v(cid:105)dx ,

(6)

where v is the relative velocity of annihilating supersymmetric particles, (cid:104)σeﬀ v(cid:105) is the thermally
averaged cross section times the relative velocity, and xf is the freeze out temperature. The σeﬀ
that enters Eq.(6) has the approximate form

σeﬀ (cid:39) σ˜g˜gδ2(cid:101)χ0

(7)

Here δ = δ˜g/δ(cid:101)χ0 and δi are deﬁned by Eq.(5). Numerical analysis shows that σef f is dominated

by the processes involving the gluino such that a smaller the mass gap between the gluino and the
LSP leads to more dominant gluino processes. The relic density depends critically on the mass
gap and we wish to keep the relic density constant as the gluino mass increases. However, an

(9)

increasing gluino mass reduces the cross section for the annihilating gluino. In oder to compensate
for the reduction in the gluino annihilation cross section so that σeﬀ remains constant, the mass gap
between the gluino and the LSP must decrease (see the ﬁrst paper of
[14] and [12]). Speciﬁcally
one requires that

∆˜g ˜χ0 = (m˜g/m ˜χ0 − 1)

(8)

must decrease as the LSP mass increases to achieve constancy of the relic density. This is what is
seen in the analysis of table 2. Further, from the trend in table 2 one expects that as the gluino
mass gets large m˜g/m ˜χ0 → 1 and ∆˜g ˜χ0 → 0 in order to achieve relic density in the desired range.
A similar phenomenon was seen in the analysis of [46].

It is pertinent to ask what the eﬀect of non-perturbative corrections to annihilation cross section im-
plies regarding the relic density analysis. In general, non-perturbative corrections can be signiﬁcant
near the threshold since here multiple gluon exchanges can occur, which produce the Sommerfeld
enhancement factor. These eﬀects may be approximated by the function E, [13] where

Here Cj=g(q) = 1/2(3/2) for ˜g˜g → gg (˜g˜g → q ¯q), where β =
˜g/s. In [12] an analysis was
carried out for the relic density including the eﬀect of the Sommerfeld enhancement and results
compared to the one using micrOMEGAs, which uses only perturbative cross section. The analysis
of [12] shows that the eﬀect of Sommerfeld enhancement is equivalent to an upward shift of the
gluino mass by 3-6 GeV without the inclusion of the Sommerfeld enhancement. Thus, based on
the analysis of [12], inclusion of non-perturbative eﬀects would modify the results by only a few
percent and our conclusions are not aﬀected in any signiﬁcant way.

The connection between LHC physics and dark matter has been discussed in the literature for some
time [47] (for a review see [48]). In the context of the gluino-neutralino coannihilation models the
connection is even stronger. This is due to the close proximity of the neutralino mass to the gluino
mass in this class of models. Thus a determination of gluino mass at the LHC would indirectly
imply a determination of the neutralino mass since it lies within 10% of the gluino mass. One
can thus make more deﬁnitive predictions for the direct detection of dark matter in this case. In
1 = α˜b + β ˜w + γ˜h1 + δ˜h2, where ˜b is the bino,
general the neutralino has eigencomponents so that ˜χ0
˜w is the wino, and ˜h1,2 are the two Higgsinos of MSSM. The cross section for the direct detection
of dark matter depends on the Higgsino content of the neutralino. The gaugino and Higgsino
eigencomponents for Models (i)-(vii) are given in table 7. One may deﬁne the Higgsino content of

the neutralino by the quantity (cid:112)γ2 + δ2. From table 7 we see that the Higgsino content of the

neutralino is typically small < 0.05. A small Higgsino content indicates that the neutralino-proton
cross sections will be small in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region. This is discussed below.

In table 8 we give a computation of the spin-independent and spin-dependent proton-neutralino

cross sections. For the spin-independent case one ﬁnds σSI

cm2. The next generation LUX-ZEPLIN dark matter experiment [49, 53] is projected to reach a
sensitivity of ∼ 10−47cm−2 [49, 53]. Thus the spin-independent proton-neutralino cross section of
the gluino-neutralino coannihilation models lies largely within the sensitivity range of the next-
generation LUX-ZEPLIN experiment. A graphical illustration of the spin-independent proton-
neutralino cross section is given in ﬁgure 11. Here we are using the Models (i)-(vii) except that
we allow tan β to vary between 2-50 and retain only those model points that satisfy the constraint
Ωh2 < 0.123. One ﬁnds that all of the models lie above the neutrino ﬂoor, some by an order of
magnitude or more. Thus most of the parameter points of ﬁgure 11 appear discoverable by LUX-
ZEPLIN. The neutralino-proton spin dependent cross section σSI
given by table 8 lies in the range
pχ0
(4 − 36) × 10−45 cm2. Here, LUX-ZEPLIN will have a maximum sensitivity of 10−42 cm2, which is

about two orders of magnitude smaller in sensitivity than what is needed to test the model in this
sector.

5 Conclusion

In this work it is shown that in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region gluino masses as low as
700 GeV consistent with the Higgs boson mass constraint and the relic density constraint would
have escaped detection at LHC RUN I and LHC RUN II with 3.2 fb−1 of integrated luminosity.
Our analysis is done within the framework of high-scale supergravity models, allowing for non-
universality in the gaugino sector. An illustrative list of models is given in table 2 where the model
points all satisfy the Higgs boson mass constraint and the relic density constraint consistent with

times the LSP mass. The small mass gap between the gluino and the neutralino is needed to
satisfy the relic density constraint via gluino-neutralino coannihilation. Requiring that the lightest
neutralino supplies all of the thermal relic abundance implies that ∆m = m˜g − m ˜χ0
lies in the
range 70-100 GeV over the entire region of the parameter space analyzed in table 2. Because of
the small mass gap, the gluino decay modes such as χ±
1 q1 ¯q2 are suppressed and the decay occurs
dominantly to χ0
1g. In the analysis of the Models
(i)-(vii) we have used the signal regions used by the ATLAS Collaboration where an optimization
of signal regions was carried out to determine the best regions for gluino discovery in the gluino-
neutralino coannihilation region.
It is found that among the seven signal regions analyzed the
leading ones are 2jl and 2jm. It is found that all the models listed in table 2 are discoverable at
LHC RUN II with up to ∼ 3400 fb−1 of integrated luminosity.
The implications of the gluino-neutralino coannihilation models for the discovery of dark matter
was also discussed. As shown in table 8 it is found that the spin-independent neutralino-proton
cross section lies in the range (1 − 10) × 10−47cm−2 and this range can be explored in the next-

generation experiments on dark matter, e.g. LUX-ZEPLIN [49, 53]. The observed signal from the
gluino-neutralino coannihilation region would be a factor of up to ten times stronger than the one
from the neutrino ﬂoor [54]. Also, as shown in table 8, the spin-dependent neutralino-proton cross
section lies in the range (0.4 − 4) × 10−44cm2. This is about two orders of magnitude smaller than
the sensitivity of LUX-ZEPLIN and thus will be more diﬃcult to observe.
