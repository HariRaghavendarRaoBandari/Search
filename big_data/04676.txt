We investigate the emergence of the continuum elastic limit from the atomistic description of
matter at zero temperature considering how locally deﬁned elastic quantities depend on the coarse
graining length scale. Results obtained numerically investigating diﬀerent model systems are ra-
tionalized in a unifying picture according to which the continuum elastic limit emerges through a
process determined by two system properties, the degree of disorder, and a length scale associated
to the transverse low-frequency vibrational modes. The degree of disorder controls the emergence of
long-range local shear stress and shear strain correlations, while the transverse length scale inﬂuences
the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations of the local elastic constants.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The mechanical properties of a solid can be described
by taking into account the discrete nature of matter, via
the introduction of an equivalent network of masses and
springs. If the size of the solid is much larger than the
typical interatomic spacing, matter can be treated as
a continuum and the mechanical properties are conve-
niently described through elasticity theory [1]. Here we
consider how the continuum description sets it as the
elastic properties of a material are investigated on in-
creasingly larger spatial scales. This is a question eas-
ily addressed in ideal crystals, where the two descrip-
tions can be related exploiting the periodicity of the lat-
tice structure. [1, 2] In real crystals, that are made of
many randomly oriented ideal micro crystals, periodicity
is lost and the connection between the two descriptions
is not obvious; in this case, one tries to recover the con-
tinuum description considering how the micro crystals
rotate in response to external deformations [3, 4].
In
amorphous materials the problem is more challenging, as
disorder induces non-aﬃne particle displacements [5] in
response to macroscopic deformations [5].
It is known
that this non-aﬃne displacement lowers the elastic con-
stants by inﬂuencing the ﬂuctuation term of the stress
tensor [6, 7]. However, the role of disorder on the emer-
gence of the continuum limit is unclear. To investigate
how disorder inﬂuences the emergence of linear elasticity,
one needs to consider the dependence of locally deﬁned
elastic properties on the coarse-graining length scale, in
systems with diﬀerent degree of disorder. Numerically,
the measure of local elastic properties can be carried out
exploiting the derivation of exact coarse graining expres-
sion for local strain and stress ﬁelds [8–10], or via ﬂuc-
tuation formulas[11, 12]. In this research direction, pre-
vious results on a two-dimensional weakly polydisperse
Lennard-Jones (LJ) [13] system, as well as on systems of

∗ acakir@ntu.edu.sg

spheres interacting via ﬁnite range purely repulsive po-
tentials [14], have found the standard deviation (s.d.) of
elastic constants deﬁned on a coarse graining length scale
w to scale as w−α, with α = d/2 in both [13] d = 2 and
d = 3 [15] spatial dimensions. The value α = d/2 has
been rationalized through the central limit theorem, as-
suming local elastic constants to be the average of ∝ wd
random variables associated to the coarse graining region.
However, a local modulus is not the sum of random vari-
ables, but rather the ratio of two coarse-grained quanti-
ties, a local stress change and a local strain change, so
that the applicability of the central limit theorem is ques-
tionable. In addition, the central limit theorem holds in
the presence of short range correlations, while the local
shear strain could be long-range correlated, as observed
in colloidal [16] and metallic [17] glasses, and theoreti-
cally predicted in granular systems [18]. These consid-
erations suggest that the exponent α, and therefore the
process by which continuum elasticity sets in, could not
be universal.

Here we show, through the numerical investigation of
diﬀerent model systems with diﬀerent degree of disorder,
that the process by which continuum elasticity sets in is
not universal. Rather, it depends on the local order and
on a length scale associated to the transverse acoustic
modes. The degree of local order ﬁxes the value of the
exponent αG governing the asymptotic scaling of the s.d.
of the local shear modulus G with the coarse-graining
length scale, ∆G ∝ w−αG . We ﬁnd αG = d/2 only in
the presence of a high degree of local order, as in previ-
ously investigated weakly polydisperse [13] or monodis-
perse systems [14]. In general, αG depends on the degree
of local order, and its value is understood from the coarse-
graining length dependence of the s.d. of the local shear
stress and of the local shear strain. The transverse vi-
brational modes ﬁx the length scale ξG above which ∆G
scale as a power law with w. In ﬁnite range purely repul-
sive particle systems this length scale diverges in the zero
pressure limit, as the jamming transition is approached.

A. Deﬁnitions of Local Quantities

We use the approach developed by Goldhirsch [19] to
deﬁne the local stress and strain based on coarse grained
displacement ﬁelds. Local stress [8] and displacement
ﬁelds [10] are deﬁned as

rijα are the α components of contact forces between in-
teracting particles i and j, rij = |rij| = |ri − rj| is the
interparticle separation, mi is the particle mass. Given
the displacement ﬁeld, the strain αβ(r) is derived as

We have used the above expressions to determine the
local elastic properties on the points of a square grid of
lattice spacing w, ﬁxing the standard deviation of the
coarse graining function to W = w/5, as in previous
studies [20]. In the following, we consider w to be our
coarse-graining length scale.

B. Standard Deviations

It is useful to recapitulate how the s.d. of diﬀerent lo-
cally deﬁned elastic quantities are expected to scale with
the coarse graining length scale. Eqs. 1 and 3 clarify that
the local strain and the local stress are averages of prop-
erties of contacts and of particles found within the coarse
graining region, whose number scales as wd. According to
the central limit theorem their s.d should scale as w−d/2
for w larger than their characteristic correlation length.
Conversely, a local modulus is the ratio of a stress X and
of a strain Y , M = X/Y . In general, there is not a closed
form for the s.d. of the ratio of two random variables.
However, if the probability distributions of Y is such that
P (Y = 0) (cid:39) 0, then
(cid:104)X(cid:105)2

where (cid:104)X(cid:105) and (cid:104)Y (cid:105) are the average values of X and Y ,

We investigate the emergence of linear elasticity in 2d
LJ systems, that model atomic systems, and in 2d Har-
monic particles, that model colloids, foams and granular
matter, via zero temperature molecular dynamics simu-
lations [21]. We consider two LJ systems. The ﬁrst one is
a mixture of NL large and N − NL small particles, with
diﬀerent fraction fL = NL/N of large particles in the
range 0–1. We vary fL to control the degree of disorder,
as the size ratio of the two components is such that when
fL (cid:39) 0 ((cid:39) 1), our system is polycrystalline, while for
fL (cid:39) 0.5 it is amorphous. As second LJ system we con-
sider the weakly polydisperse system studied in Ref 13, to
rationalize previous results within our approach. We ex-
plore the role of the length scale associated to transverse
vibrational modes considering Harmonic particles at dif-
ferent values of the pressure, as this length scale is known
to diverge in the zero pressure limit [22]. We notice that
previous studies have considered the dependence of the
macroscopic elastic constants on disorder by tuning the
relative fraction of diﬀerent species [23]. However, the
role of disorder on the emergence of the continuum limit
has not been previously addressed.

for rij < rc

V (rij) = 0 for rij ≥ rc,
where  = 1 is the energy parameter, rc is a cutoﬀ, Voﬀset
is such that V (rc) = 0, dij = di + dj, where di is the
‘diameter’ of particle i. We consider a bidisperse and a
weakly polydisperse system. In bidisperse systems, large
and small particles have a diameter ratio 1.4, and rc =
2.5dij.
In polydisperse systems, particle diameters are
drawn from a uniform distribution with average value
(cid:104)d(cid:105) and small s.d. ∼ 0.1(cid:104)d(cid:105), so that the system is weakly
disperse [13], and the cutoﬀ rc = 21/6dij so that the
interaction is purely repulsive. The systems are prepared
at zero temperature minimizing the energy of interaction
through the conjugate-gradient algorithm, starting from
inﬁnite temperature states, and have a pressure of the
order of ten. For each set of parameters, our data are
obtained averaging over 100 independent conﬁgurations
with N = 104 particles.

B. Harmonic particle systems

In Harmonic systems, particles interact via the poten-

tial

V (rij) =

k(dij−rij)2 for rij < dij; V (rij) = 0 otherwise.

where k is the spring constant, dij = di + dj is the
average diameter of the interacting particles. We have
considered bidisperse systems, with a size ratio 1.4. We
have prepared systems at diﬀerent values of the pressure
p, which is ﬁxed to a high precision (|dp| /p < 10−2)
using a combination of energy minimization and com-
pression/decompression steps. The ﬁnal pressure spans
5 order of magnitudes, p = 10−9 − 10−2.

C. Deformations

We measure local elastic constants by imposing small
macroscopic compression or shear deformations to the
above systems, respectively to measure local bulk and
shear moduli. To explicitly check that we work in the
linear response regime, we increase the strain through a
sequence of small steps, minimizing the energy after each
step through the conjugate gradient algorithm. We do
observe the locally deﬁned stress and strain to be linearly
related, and thus estimate the local elastic constants

cij(r, w) = ∂σi(r, w)/∂εj(r, w),

through a linear best-ﬁt of the stress versus strain rela-
tion. Here cii is to the local bulk modulus, while cij, with
i (cid:54)= j, is the local shear modulus, under the assumption
of rotational symmetry.

IV. RESULTS

A. Lennard Jones Systems

The local stress and the local strain are averages of
particle and contact properties in the coarse graining re-
gion, as discussed in Sec. II B, and therefore their s.d. is
expected to scale as w−1 if w is larger than their correla-
tion length. In the bidisperse LJ systems, we do actually
observe the s.d. of the diagonal local stress, σxx, and
the diagonal local strain, εxx, to scale as w−1 regard-
less of the fraction of large particles fL, as illustrated
in Fig. 1a,b. Conversely, the s.d. of the local oﬀ di-
agonal (shear) stress, σxy, and of the local oﬀ diagonal
(shear) strain, εxy, scale as w−α, but α depends on fL,
as in panels d,e. Speciﬁcally, the exponent α is close to 1
only at high values of fL. We also observe α (cid:39) 1 for the
weakly polydisperse LJ system, in agreement with earlier
results [13].
A value α (cid:54)= 1 implies the breakdown of the central
limit theorem, and hence the presence of long-range cor-
relations in the local shear stress and in the local shear
strain [16, 17]. To explicitly check for the presence of
these long-range correlations we investigate the correla-
tion function of the local shear strain [16] εxy deﬁned
on the smallest of our investigated length scale, w = 5,
for two values of fL. Speciﬁcally, we have computed the

for the local shear strain, the local shear stress and the local

spectively, for fL = 0.8 and 0.5. For fL = 0.8 we expect
no long-range correlations as α (cid:39) 1, and consistently ob-
serve the correlation functions to decay exponentially, as
illustrated in Fig. 2a. On the contrary for fL = 0.5 we
expect long-range correlations. In this case the correla-
tion functions exhibit persistent oscillations analogous to
those recently experimentally observed in colloidal sys-
tems [16], as illustrated in Fig. 2b.

Local elastic constants are deﬁned as the ratio of a local
stress change and of a local strain change. Accordingly,
as clariﬁed by Eq. 4, their s.d. will asymptotically scale
as that of the local stress or as that the local strain,
depending on which one asymptotically dominates. This
is consistent with the results of Fig. 1c,f, where we show
that the s.d. ∆K of the local bulk modulus K scales as
w−1, while that of the local shear modulus scales as w−α,
with α depending on fL. To illustrate the connection
between the exponents αG, αxy , ασxy , with which the
s.d. of the local shear modulus, of the local shear strain
and of the local shear stress scale with w, we show their
dependence on fL in Fig. 3(inset). Since αxy ≤ ασxy at
all fL, the s.d. of the shear strain dominate that of the
shear stress, and thus we expect from Eq. 4 αG (cid:39) αxy ,
as observed.

The inset of Fig. 3 evidences that, in the bidisperse LJ
systems, the exponents depend on the fraction of large

FIG. 3. The inset shows that the fraction fL of large par-
ticle ﬁxes the exponents governing the scaling of the s.d. of
elastic properties with the coarse-graining length scale w, in
the bidisperse LJ systems. Combining results obtained inves-
tigating diﬀerent systems the main ﬁgure suggests that the
exponent governing the scaling of the s.d. of the local shear
modulus, αG is ﬁxed by the degree of disorder, as estimated
by the local orientational order parameter Qloc

considered. Bidisperse systems are investigated at diﬀerent
values of the fraction of large particles fL.

of a stress scale. Accordingly, the pressure does not in-
ﬂuence the ordering properties of the system, and hence
the dependence of the s.d. of the local elastic constants
on the coarse graining length scale. Conversely, in Har-
monic systems close to the jamming transition (p → 0)
the macroscopic elastic constants scale critically with the
pressure [24]. This makes of interest to investigate how
the jamming transition inﬂuences the emergence of the
continuum elastic limit.

The critical-like nature of the jamming transition sug-

gests a scaling relation for ∆G and ∆K of the form,

∆G(p, w)

G(p)

= G

;

∆K(p, w)

K(p)

= K

where G ∝ p1/2 and K ∝ p0 close to the jamming tran-
sition [24].

We have veriﬁed these scaling relations investigating
the dependence of the s.d. on w for Harmonic disks, and
fraction large particles fL = 0.5 and fL = 0.25. Results
for the bulk modulus are shown in Fig. 4a,c. The s.d.
of the local bulk modulus asymptotically scales as w−1,
regardless of the value of fL, and data corresponding to
diﬀerent pressures can be collapsed as suggested by the
scaling relation of Eq. 6. The corresponding length scale
ξK approaches a constant value in the p → 0 limit, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 5. Analogous results for the shear mod-
ulus are illustrated in Fig. 4b,d. In this case the asymp-
totic dependence of the s.d. on w depends on fL, as in
LJ systems, and the scaling of data corresponding to dif-
ferent pressures suggests ξG ∝ p−νG where νG ∼ 0.25, as

generally depend on the ordering properties of the sys-
tem. To check whereas this is the case we have inves-

long range local shear strain or stress correlations, so that
the s.d. of the local shear modulus scales as w−α with
α (cid:39) 1. As the degree of disorder increases long range
correlation emerges, and α decreases. If one assumes lin-
ear elasticity to hold to a good approximation above the
length scale wLE at which ∆G(wLE)/∆G(w0) = x, with
x an arbitrary small threshold, w0 a microscopic length
scale, then one ﬁnds wLE ∝ x−1/αG . Given the depen-
dence of αG on the disorder properties of the system, this
implies that the length scale wLE above which linear elas-
ticity holds strongly increases as the degree of disorder
increases.

We have clariﬁed that the process by which the contin-
uum elastic limit emerges, as evaluated investigating the
dependence of the standard deviation of the local elas-
tic constants on the coarse graining length scale, is not
universal. Rather, two properties of the system at hand
inﬂuence the dependence of the s.d. of the local shear
modulus with the coarse graining length scale. Asymp-

FIG. 4. Coarse graining length scale dependence of the s.d
of the local bulk modulus (a), for pressures in the range p =
10−2 : 1.25 × 10−7, from top to bottom, and of the shear
modulus (b), for pressures in the range p = 10−2 : 7 × 10−5,
from bottom to top. Panels c and d illustrate the collapse of
these data according to Eq. 6, with ξK (cid:39) const., and ξG ∝
p−0.25. All data refer to fL = 0.5 system. In panel (d) we
also illustrate data for fL = 0.25 (full symbols, data scaled
by 0.5), to clarify that the length scale ξG does not depend
on fL.

in Fig. 5. ξG can therefore be identiﬁed with the length
scale ξc associated to the transverse vibrational modes
of jammed systems, that exhibits the same pressure de-
pendence in systems of Harmonic particles [22, 25]. Our
ﬁndings for the scaling of ∆K and ∆G on p, and hence
on the distance from the jamming threshold, are in line
with recent results [14] obtained determining the local
moduli using ﬂuctuation formulas in the linear response
regime [11, 12].

These results clarify that the pressure ﬁxes the length
scale above which the s.d. of the local elastic quantities
scales as a power law of the coarse graining length scale.
Conversely, the pressure does not inﬂuence the asymp-
totic behavior of the scaling functions, which behave as
G(x) ∝ x−αG , and as K(x) ∝ x−1, respectively. The in-
vestigation of diﬀerent values of fL conﬁrms the inﬂuence
of the degree of order of the system on the value of the
exponent αG, as summarized in Fig. 3.

FIG. 5. Pressure dependence of the length scales ξK,G for
Harmonic system with diﬀerent fL. The solid lines repre-
sent power laws, νG = −0.25. Squares (circles) show systems
with fL = 0.25(0.5). We do not show data for ξG at smaller
pressures, as they are aﬀected by system size eﬀects.

totically, the s.d.
scales as a power law of the coarse
graining length scale, with an exponent which is ﬁxed
by the degree of disorder. This is so as the local shear
modulus is the ratio of a local shear stress and of a local
shear strain, that could exhibit long range correlations
in the presence of disorder. The power-law asymptotic
regime occurs after a typical length scale, which is the
typical length scale of the transverse vibrational modes.
The role of this length scale is particularly relevant in sys-
tems of particles interacting via purely repulsive forces,
as it diverges in the zero pressure limit corresponding to
the jamming transition.

The main open question ahead is the individuation
of the physical mechanisms responsible for the reported
long range correlations in the elastic ﬁelds. There are
contrasting results in the literature, as the local elastic
moduli have been observed to be Gaussian in simula-
tions of polymeric glasses [26] and of LJ glasses [13, 27],
while the local shear strain has been observed to be long
range in colloidal [16] and metallic [17] glasses, and the-
oretically predicted in granular systems [18]. Our results
suggest that the investigation of the degree of disorder,
or of other structural order parameter such as the excess
entropy [28], could allow to rationalize this discrepancy.
