Top physics in ATLAS

Roger Naranjo a

on behalf of the ATLAS collaboration

DESY, Hamburg, Germany.

Abstract. These proceedings summarize the latest measurements on top produc-
tion, top properties and searches using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The
measurements are performed on pp collision data with a center of mass energy
√s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV.

1 Introduction

The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle of the Standard Model
(SM). It has a life-time shorter than the hadronization time and oﬀers a window
to search for new physics. With large numbers of top events produced at LHC
in Run-1, it is possible to study its properties in detail. These proceedings
present measurements of top production, top properties and searches at the
center of mass energy of 7, 8 and 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment [1].

2 Top production measurements

2.1 Top pair production

The ATLAS experiment has performed measurements of the inclusive top-
antitop production cross section of t¯t production at center of mass energy of 7, 8
and 13 TeV in the dilepton channel [2,4]. The measurement at 8 TeV represents
the most precise measurement to date, even more precise than next-to-next-
to-leading order (NNLO) predictions [3]. At 13 TeV, the cross section is found
to be σt¯t = 825 ± 49 (stat) ± 60(syst) ± 83(lumi) pb. In the three analyses, a
simultaneous ﬁt of the cross section, b-jet reconstruction and tagging eﬃciency
is performed in the eµ channel. All the measurements are in agreement with
SM predictions, as shown in Figure 1a.

New physics could aﬀect the shape of the diﬀerential cross section as a func-
tion of top kinematics.
In this conference, measurements performed in two
diﬀerent topologies were presented: the resolved and the boosted topologies,
which are optimized for tops with transverse momentum pT < 300 and and
pT > 300 GeV respectively. In the resolved topology, the measurement of the
top-antitop diﬀerential cross section is performed as a function of the mass,
pT and rapidity of the top pair system at 7 TeV [5]. These measurements are
performed in a ﬁducial region closely matching the detector acceptance and
using tops observables based on stable particles in the eµ channel.

The observed spectra are softer than the
Monte Carlo (MC) predictions.
In the
boosted topology, the diﬀerential cross sec-
tion as a function of the pT of the t¯t sys-
tem is measured in the semileptonic decay
channel at 8 TeV [6]. The measurements are
performed in both a ﬁducial and total phase
space. The measurements are also found to
be softer than the MC predictions.

2.2 Single top production

multaneous ﬁt to the t¯tW and

the 68% and 95% CL uncer-
tainty contours [7].

Several measurements of the inclusive single
top cross section in the s, t and W t channel at
7 and 8 TeV have been performed by ATLAS.
The latest 8 TeV results were presented in
this conference. Figure 1b shows a summary
of these measurements [8]. The inclusive
cross sections for t-channel is found to be σt = 82.6± 1.2 (stat.)± 11.4 (syst.)±
3.1 (PDF) ± 2.3 (lumi.) pb, showing a good agreement with the NLO+NNLLb
predictions [9], as well as the inclusive measurement in the W t channel where
the measured value is σt = 23.0 ± 1.3 (stat.) ± +3.2
(syst.) ± 1.1 (lumi.) pb [10].
An upper limit for the s-channel cross section was established [11].

2.3 Top pair production in association with vector bosons

The t¯tW and t¯tZ cross sections were measured in ﬁnal states with two, three
or four leptons [7]. In this analysis, a simultaneous ﬁt is performed in 20 signal
and control regions. The control regions are deﬁned by varying the number
jets and lepton charge in the event. The results agree with the SM prediction
as shown in Figure 2.

3 Top quark properties

3.1 Mass

Measurements of the top mass, performed in t¯t events in the semileptonic and
the dileptonic channels, were presented [12]. The analysis in the semileptonic
channel uses a 3-dimensional template ﬁt which determines simultaneously the
top quark mass, the jet and b-jet energy scale factor. This measurement is the
most precise mass measurement performed by ATLAS to date. The dilepton
channel uses a one dimensional template ﬁt and the combined result is found
to be mtop = 172.99 ± 0.48(stat.) ± 0.78(syst.) GeV.
In single top decays, the measurement is performed through a one dimen-
sional template ﬁt using the invariant mass of the lepton and b-jet, in order
to reduce the modelling uncertainties [13]. Neural networks are used to opti-
mize the purity of the selection to 50%. The measured value is found to be
mtop = 172.2 ± 0.7(stat.) ± 2.0(syst.) GeV.
Moreover, a measurement of the pole mass using the normalized diﬀeren-
tial cross section for t¯t + 1-jet as a function of the inverse of the invariant
mass of system was performed [14]. The selected events are identiﬁed us-
ing the lepton+jets top-quark pair decay channel, where lepton refers to ei-
ther an electron or a muon. The measured value is found to be mtop =
173.7 ± 1.5(stat.) ± 1.4(syst.)+1.0

−0.5(theory) GeV.

3.2 Spin correlation

Top pairs produced via the strong interaction are produced unpolarized at
leading order. Their spins are correlated and information transferred to decay
products. A measurement of the t¯t spin correlation at 8 TeV was performed [15].
In this analysis, the t¯t spin correlation is extracted from dilepton events by using
the diﬀerence in the azimuthal angle of the two selected leptons. The measured
value is consistent with the SM predictions. Moreover, the measurement of the
angular distribution of the decay products is sensitive to super symmetric top
squark (stop) pair production. The top squarks with masses between the top
quark mass 172.5 GeV and 191 GeV are excluded at the 95% conﬁdence level.

4 Searches

In this conference, limits in searches for ﬂavor changing neutral currents (FCNC)
were presented [16]. FCNC are predicted by the SM but are largely suppressed
by the GIM mechanism. In Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) models the
FCNC are enhanced, giving a window to search for new physics. One search is
performed in t¯t events with one top quark decaying to a Z-boson and a light
quark and the other to a W -boson and a b-quark. Both bosons are required to
decay leptonically. No evidence of FCNC is found and an observed upper limit
is established. Another search for FCNC is performed in single top production
via gu/c → t with the top decaying to a Z-boson and a light quark [16]. Only
the leptonic channel is considered and upper limits are established on the cross
section times branching ratio and on the coupling constants of the processes.

5 Conclusions

ATLAS has performed multiple measurements in the top physics domain. The
measurements of cross sections and properties are in agreement with the SM
predictions. Some top quark properties were used to exclude BSM models and
limits were established for FCNC searches.
