Abstract. We consider a mixture of one-dimensional strongly interacting Fermi gases
up to six components, subjected to a longitudinal harmonic conﬁnement. In the limit
of inﬁnitely strong repulsions we provide an exact solution which generalizes the one
for the two-component mixture. We show that an imbalanced mixture under harmonic
conﬁnement displays partial spatial separation among the components, with a structure
which depends on the relative population of the various components. Furthermore, we
provide a symmetry characterization of the ground and excited states of the mixture
introducing and evaluating a suitable operator, namely the conjugacy class sum.
We show that, even under external conﬁnement, the gas has a deﬁnite symmetry
which corresponds to the most symmetric one compatible with the imbalance among
the components. This generalizes the predictions of the Lieb-Mattis theorem for a
fermionic mixture with more than two components.

Introduction

Ultracold atomic gases made with rare-earth elements cooled to quantum degeneracy
and subjected to two-dimensional optical lattices provide a beautiful realization of
the model of one-dimensional multicomponent Fermi gases with strong and equal
intercomponent repulsion among the species [1].

In the absence of external harmonic conﬁnement in the longitudinal direction,
the system of multi-component fermions with intercomponent delta interactions is a
generalization of the Yang-Gaudin Hamiltonian [2–4] and can be solved by nested Bethe
Ansatz [5]. The homogeneous system may also be described at low energy as a multi-
component Luttinger liquid. This model has been extensively studied in the context of
electronic multichannel systems [6, 7] and exotic condensed matter materials [7–11].

The experiments with ultracold atom are characterized by the presence of an
external longitudinal conﬁnement, which can be well approximated as harmonic.
In
this case, the Bethe Ansatz solutions do not apply, however, a special integrable case is
provided by the limit of inﬁnitely strong repulsions among the species. In this regime,
corresponding to the Tonks-Girardeau regime for ultracold bosonic atoms, fermions
belonging to diﬀerent components further fermionize, as has been experimentally shown
in Ref.[12]:
the wavefunction vanishes at contact and they can be mapped onto
a noninteracting Fermi gas in the same external conﬁnement with particle number
corresponding to the total number of fermions in the mixture, following the same
idea as the original Girardeau solution for bosons [13]. An additional diﬃculty in the
multicomponent case is that the manifold displays a large degeneracy [14]. This is
associated to the arbitrariness in ﬁxing the relative phase once two fermions belonging
to diﬀerent components get in contact and then exchange their mutual position. The
degeneracy is however broken at ﬁnite interactions, where one expects a unique ground
state [15, 16]. The ground state branch can be obtained by performing a strong-coupling
1/g expansion, g being the interaction strength among the fermions. This provides a
unique way to identify in the degenerate manifold what would be the ground and excited
states at ﬁnite interactions [16, 17].

In this work, we explore this type of solution for multicomponent Fermi mixtures
with a number of components that ranges from two to six as in the 173Yb experiment
of Ref.[1]. We study in particular the density proﬁles of the imbalanced mixtures, thus
generalizing the works of [18, 19]. As main result, we ﬁnd a complex, inhomogeneous
spatial structure. We then explore the symmetry property of both the ground and
excited state branches of the solution, introducing and evaluating suitable operators
for the mixture, ie the transposition class-sum and the three-cycle class sum operators
[20, 21]. This allows us to test (and generalize) the Lieb-Mattis theorem [22] for the
trapped multicomponent mixtures, showing that the ground state carries the most
symmetric conﬁguration allowed by the imbalance among the components.

1. Model

We consider a system of N fermions of equal mass m, divided in r species with
population N1, N2, . . . , Nr. We assume that all components are subjected to the same
harmonic potential V (x) = mω2x2/2, as is the case of fermions in optical traps. The
fermions belonging to diﬀerent species interact with each other via the contact potential
v(x − x(cid:48)) = gδ(x − x(cid:48)), where g is the interaction strength, and δ(x) is the Dirac delta
function. The total Hamiltonian reads

In the following, we will focus on the impenetrable limit g → ∞. In this case the cusp
condition imposes that the many-body wavefunction vanishes when two particles meet,
ie Ψ(xj = x(cid:96)) = 0 for each pair {j, (cid:96)}. This condition is exactly satistisﬁed by the fully
antisymmetric solution ΨA(x1, . . . , xN ) of N = N1 +N2 +...+Nr noninteracting fermions
in the same conﬁning potential, corresponding to a Slater determinant constructed with
single-particle wavefunctions φ0, . . . , φN−1. To construct the exact solution, we further
note that the behaviour of the many-body wavefunction under exchange between two
fermions belonging to diﬀerent components is not ﬁxed by symmetry, and requires to
be ﬁxed by additional conditions. Hence, we consider a general solution of the form
[17, 23]

Ψ(x1, . . . , xN ) =

aP χ(xP (1) < ··· < xP (N ))ΨA(x1, . . . , xN )

(3)

(cid:88)

P∈SN

where χ(x1 < ··· < xN ) is the indicator function of the sector {x1 < ··· < xN} ⊂ RN , ie
it is 1 within the sector and 0 everywhere else, both Ψ and ΨA are assumed to have unit
normalization, and the choice of the coeﬃcients aP will be detailed below. Note that we
need only to determine S = N !
N1!...Nr! coeﬃcients aP : the wavefunction is antisymmetric
under exchange of fermions belonging to the same component, and this property is
already encoded in ΨA. This observation allows us to restrict ourself to the so-called
snippet basis [23, 24], ie consider only the global permutations modulo the permutations
of particles belonging to the same species.

General solution
In order to determine the aP coeﬃcients for the ground state manifold, denoted
a1, . . . , aS in the snippet basis, we use the same method as in Ref.[17]. It consists in a
perturbative expansion of the energy to ﬁrst order in 1/g → 0, ie we write E = EA −
(/m2)K/g where EA is the energy associated with ΨA and K = −(m2/)(∂E/∂g−1)

dx1 . . . dxN δ(xk − xk+1)

for k ∈ {1, . . . , N − 1}. Note that, thanks to the parity invariance of this problem, we
also have αk = αN−k, so that there we have only (cid:98)N/2(cid:99) coeﬃcients to compute.

In order to ﬁnd the wavefunction which corresponds to the ground state at ﬁnite,
large interactions, the next step is to ﬁnd the solutions that minimize the energy, ie that
maximize K. To do so, we impose that (∂K/∂ai) = 0 for all ai. This turns out to be
equivalent to the diagonalization problem

V (cid:126)A = K (cid:126)A

(7)
with (cid:126)A = (a1, . . . , aS)T and V is a S × S matrix depending only on the αk coeﬃcients.
We recall that, since aP = aQ if going from P to Q consists in exchanging fermions
belonging the same specie, we can reduce the problem from a N ! to an S-dimensional
problem by using the snippet basis.

In order to compute the αk coeﬃcients, we use the following expression for ΨA,

based on a Vandermode determinant result [26, 27]

2. Density proﬁles

As the ﬁrst application, using Eq.(3) together with the solution of Eq.(7) for the
coeﬃcients aP and Eq.(11) for the weigths αk we determine the exact density proﬁle of
each component of the mixture, according to the deﬁnition

(cid:90) N(cid:89)

j=1

density n(x) =(cid:80)r

where we have indicated by xν one of the coordinates corresponding to a fermion
belonging to the ν-th component of the mixture.
In the following, for each given
mixture, we shall concentrate on the ground state and ﬁrst many-body excited state
with a diﬀerent symmetry from the ground state.

Quite generally, for all the ground state density proﬁles we ﬁnd that the total
ν=1 nν(x) coincides with the one of a noninteracting N -particle Fermi
gas under external conﬁnement, as previously reported [28]. For equal populations in
the various species , the ground state density proﬁle is the same for all the species and
coincides apart to a normalization factor with the one of a noninteracting Fermi gas
with N particles in harmonic conﬁnement, which is characterized by N peaks [29], as
shown in Fig.1. The excited states display a variety of proﬁles, where in particular
the two-component mixture does not change and the six-component one shows small
deviations with respect to the corresponding ground-state density proﬁles, while the
three-component mixture diplays a diﬀerent, two-peak structure. These diﬀerences may
be accounted for by considering the diﬀerent symmetry of the excited states in the three
cases, see Sec.3.

In the case of an imbalanced mixture, the partial density proﬁles display a rich
structure, as presented in Fig.2. We ﬁrst consider the case of an imbalanced two-
component mixture. In the polaron case, where N1 = N − 1 and N2 = 1 (top panels

Figure 1.
Density proﬁles for the ground state (left panel) and for the ﬁrst
many-body excited state with a symmetry diﬀerent than the ground state (right
panel) for three balanced mixtures (ie with the same number of particles in each
specie N1 = ··· = Nr) of strongly interacting Fermi gases, with diﬀerent numbers
of components r = 2, 3, 6 and total particle number N = 6 (from top to bottom:
Nν = 3, 2, 1). The density proﬁles are the same for each component of the mixture, ie
n1(x) = n2(x) = ... = nr(x). The inset shows the corresponding ground state density
proﬁles for the case of the corresponding mixtures of noninteracting fermions.

in Fig.2), for the ground-state density we observe a spatial separation of the polaron
density proﬁle at the center of the trap and the majority component at the wings of
the trap. By comparing with the results for the corresponding noninteracting gas, one
clearly sees the eﬀect of repulsive interactions: the mutual repulsion among the two
components push the majority component to a larger region of the trap and a hole is
created around the polaron. For the excited state, we ﬁnd that the density proﬁles are
proportional to the ones of a noninteracting gas. We understand this as being related
of the symmetry properties of this particular excited state – as it will be discussed in
detail in Sec.3 below, we ﬁnd that it has the same symmetry as the noninteracting gas.
In the case of more than one particle in the minority component (central panels in
Fig.2) for the ground state density proﬁles we observe a partial demixing through a more
complex structure, with the majority component occupying both the inner core and the
external wings of the density proﬁles. This may be viewed as a mesoscopic realization of
an antiferromagnetic conﬁguration [30]. The excited state density proﬁles have instead
a two-peak (majority component) or one-peak (minority component) structure which
recalls the ground state of the polaron. Also in this case, the analysis of the symmetry
of the proﬁles brings an explanation, since we ﬁnd that this excited state has the same
symmetry as the ground state of the polaron.

The three component imbalanced mixture (bottom panels in Fig.2) displays an even
more complex spatial-separated shell structure in the ground state proﬁles, generalizing
the two component case: the minority component occupies the inner of the trap, and the
majority component the outer shells, with the intermediate component placed spatially
between the other two. For the excited state, we ﬁnd again a mixed state whose density
proﬁles are proportional to the ones of a noninteracting gas. As it will be discussed in

symmetry as the ground-state of the two-component balanced mixture.

operator Γ(2) = [(2)]N =(cid:80)

correspond to decreasing-energy solutions at ﬁnite interactions. In order to completely
characterize the symmetry of the various states of the degenerate manifold at g = ∞,
we label the states by calculating the expectation value of the transposition class-sum
i<j(ij) [20, 21, 24]. On the sector basis, Γ(2) is a N ! × N !
ij = −1 if going from sector i to sector j only trasposes
operator whose elements are Γ(2)
two fermions, and Γ(2)
ij = 0 otherwise. Note that, also in this case, we can reduce the
dimension of such operator to an S × S matrix, by summing over the contributions of
the sectors associated with one snippet.

The spectral decomposition of Γ(2) on the snippet basis (and of all the other single
class-sum operators Γ(n)) gives all the irreductibles representations (’irreps’) of SN that
are compatible with the fermionic nature of each component, and that can be fully
encoded by Young tableaux. More precisely, each Young tableau Yγ corresponds to a
unique eigenvalue γ of Γ(2), via the expression

(cid:88)

i

γ =

1
2

λi(λi − 2i + 1)

(13)

where i and λi refer respectively to the line and number of boxes in this line of Young
tableau.

Then, projecting a given solution (cid:126)Ai over the eigenbasis of Γ(2) allows to
characterize its symmetry. Here we summarize some of our results for the ground states
( (cid:126)Amax, Kmax) and the ﬁrst excited states with a diﬀerent symmetry ( (cid:126)Aexcited, Kexcited)
of diﬀerent systems for N = 6 particles: where

and the Y−γ are obtained by taking the symmetric of Yγ with respect to the main
diagonal.

Table 1 shows that the ground and excited states constructed with Eq.(3) have a
deﬁnite symmetry which can be readily extracted by the associated Young tableau. An
exception is provided by the ground state of the case N1 = N2 = 3 and by the excited
state of the case N1 = 3, N2 = 2, N3 = 1, where the the transposition class-sum operator
Γ(2) does not allow to uniquely associate a Young tableau to the wavefunction, since
Eq. (13) gives two Young tableaux corresponding to the eigenvalue −3,
,

and

and also to the the eigenvalue 3,

and

. In this case to establish the symmetry

of the wavefunction we use another operator, the 3-cycle class sum Γ(3), since these two
Young tableaux correspond to two diﬀerent eigenvalues of Γ(3)

[20].

Furthermore,

for all the mixture considered we note that the ground state,
corresponding to K = Kmax, is the most symmetric one, and the excited state is obtained
by decreasing the symmetry of the state by taking out one cell from the top row and
putting it in the ﬁrst available lower row of the Young tableau, thus making it more
antisymmetric. The opposite case of K = 0 is associated with the most antisymmetric
Young tableau. The above result for the ground state supports the observation of
Ref. [31], where an Ansatz for the ground state wavefunction was suggested, and is also
in agreement with a general demonstration provided in [32]. We notice also that when
the number of particles coincides with the number of components, ie r = N , the ground
state is fully symmetric, and has the same symmetry as the bosonic Tonks-Girardeau
gas.

This analysis provides a veriﬁcation and an exemple of the generalization of the

Lieb-Mattis theorem [22] for the case of multicomponent fermionic mixtures.

4. Summary and conclusions

In this work we have considered a multicomponent strongly correlated fermionic mixture
up to six components. Using a generalization of the pioneering solution due to Girardeau
for the Bose gas and of the recently developed solution for the two-component Fermi gas
we have determined the exact many-body wavefunctions for the degenerate manifold
at inﬁnite interactions. We have identiﬁed the one which corresponds to the ground
state at ﬁnite interactions as the one which has the maximum value for the parameter
K, related to the interaction energy. We have then obtained the density proﬁles for
the mixture under harmonic conﬁnement. For an imbalanced mixture we have found
a partial phase separation among the components, which is an eﬀect of the strong
repulsive interactions. Furthermore, we have characterized the symmetry properties of
the ground- and of some excited state wavefunctions of the manifold by introducing
suitable class-sum operators, and we have shown that the ground-state wavefunctions
have a deﬁnite symmetry, corresponding to the most symmetric (or less antisymmetric)
conﬁguration compatible with the imbalance among the components. Our exact solution
