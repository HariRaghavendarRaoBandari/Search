ABSTRACT
The hot subdwarf HD 49798 has an X-ray emitting compact companion with a spin-period of
13.2 s and a dynamically measured mass of 1.28±0.05 M(cid:12), consistent with either a neutron
star or a white dwarf. Using all the available XMM-Newton and Swift observations of this
source, we could perform a phase-connected timing analysis extending back to the ROS AT
data obtained in 1992. We found that the pulsar is spinning up at a rate of (2.15±0.05)×10−15
s s−1. This result is best interpreted in terms of a neutron star accreting from the wind of its
subdwarf companion, although the remarkably steady period derivative over more than 20
years is unusual in wind-accreting neutron stars. The possibility that the compact object is
a massive white dwarf accreting through a disk cannot be excluded, but it requires a larger
distance and/or properties of the stellar wind of HD 49798 diﬀerent from those derived from
the modelling of its optical/UV spectra.

INTRODUCTION

HD 49798/RX J0648.0–4418 is a binary system with orbital period
of 1.55 days containing an X-ray pulsar with spin period of 13.2
s (Thackeray 1970; Stickland & Lloyd 1994; Israel et al. 1997;
Mereghetti et al. 2011). This X-ray source is particularly interest-
ing since it is the only known pulsar with a hot subdwarf compan-
ion1. Its properties are quite diﬀerent from those of all the other
X-ray binaries containing accretion-powered neutron stars or white
dwarfs. The X-ray emission from RX J0648.0–4418 shows two dis-
tinct features: a strongly pulsed soft thermal component, well ﬁt by
a blackbody of temperature kT∼30 eV, and a harder tail (power
law photon index ∼2), which accounts for most of the emission
above 0.6 keV. An upper limit on the pulsar spin period derivative
of | ˙P| < 6× 10−15 s s−1 (90% c.l.) was derived by phase-connecting
XMM-Newton observations obtained in 2008 and 2011 (Mereghetti
et al. 2013).

The masses of the two stars in this binary system are well con-
strained by the measurement of the optical and X-ray mass func-
tions, the system inclination being derived from the duration of the
X-ray eclipse (Mereghetti et al. 2009): with a mass of 1.50±0.05

bara et al. (2012), but the detection of an X-ray periodicity awaits conﬁrma-
tion.

M(cid:12), HD 49798 is among the most massive hot subdwarfs of O spec-
tral type, while the mass of the pulsating X-ray source is 1.28±0.05
M(cid:12).

HD 49798 is one of the few hot subdwarfs for which evidence
for a stellar wind has been reported (Hamann et al. 1981; Hamann
2010). It was thus natural to explain the relatively small X-ray lumi-
nosity of this binary (see Sect. 2.2) as emission powered by wind
accretion onto either a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star (NS).
The WD hypothesis was favored by Mereghetti et al. (2009), based
on a simple estimate of the expected luminosity resulting from the
wind parameters reported by Hamann et al. (1981) and assuming a
distance of 650 pc (Kudritzki & Simon 1978).

To better understand this system, we have performed a timing
analysis of all the available X-ray observations in which the 13.2
s pulsations can be detected with a high conﬁdence level. This has
allowed us to derive a phase-connected timing solution and to mea-
sure for the ﬁrst time the pulsar spin-up (Section 2). On the basis
of this result, in Section 3 we rediscuss the nature of the compact
companion of HD 49798.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

Since May 2002 to October 2014, several observations of
HD 49798 were carried out using the XMM-Newton satellite (see
Table 1). In this work we used the data collected with the three

CCD cameras of the EPIC instrument. In all the observations they
were operated in Full Frame mode, which provides a time reso-
lution of 73 ms for the pn camera and of 2.6 s for the two MOS
cameras. Source counts were extracted from a circle of 30(cid:48)(cid:48) radius
around the position of HD 49798.

HD 49798 was also observed with the ROSAT satellite on
November 11, 1992. These are the data in which the pulsations
were discovered (Israel et al. 1997), and they allow us to extend
the baseline of our phase-connected timing solution. For the anal-
ysis reported here we used the counts obtained with the PSPC in-
strument in the 0.1–0.5 keV energy range (extraction radius of 1
arcmin). Finally, we included in the timing analysis for the phase-
connection also the observations carried out with the Swift XRT
instrument in January 2013, May 2014, August 2014, and Jan-
uary/February 2015.

The times of arrival were converted to the Solar system barycen-
ter and corrected for the orbital motion using the parameters given
in Table 2. The phases of the pulsations were derived by ﬁtting a
constant plus a sinusoid to the folded pulse proﬁles. For the EPIC
data we used the pn proﬁles in the energy range 0.15–0.5 keV,
which have the largest pulsed fraction. In order to obtain a phase-
connected timing solution, we ﬁtted the pulse phases as a function
of time with the function

φ(t) = φ0 + ν0(t − T0) + 0.5˙ν(t − T0)2

(1)

where ν = 1/P is the star rotation frequency. We started by using
the most closely spaced observations (Summer 2011) and gradu-
ally included in the ﬁt the other observations, as increasingly more
precise ﬁt parameters allowed us to keep track of the number of
intervening pulses. In this way we could obtain a unique solution
giving a good ﬁt to all the considered data with the values of ν, ˙ν
and orbital parameters reported in Table 2. The ﬁt to the data points
and the residuals are shown in Fig. 1. The highly statistically sig-
niﬁcant quadratic term in the ﬁt corresponds to a spin-up rate of
˙P = (−2.15 ± 0.05) × 10−15 s s−1.

Based on the phase-connected timing solution we could join
all the XMM-Newton observations and produce the background-
subtracted pulse proﬁles in diﬀerent energy ranges shown in Fig. 2.
This ﬁgure shows a striking change in the pulse proﬁle at an energy
of 0.5 keV. At lower energies, where the thermal spectral compo-
nent dominates, the light curves are characterized by a single broad
pulse. The pulsed fraction (deﬁned as the amplitude of a ﬁtted sinu-
soid divided by the average count rate) is 65±1% in the 0.15-0.23
keV range and 44±1% in the 0.23-0.5 keV range. Above 0.5 keV
the light curve is more complex, displaying two pulses not aligned
in phase with the low-energy one and with an energy-dependent
relative intensity.

bital revolution. Therefore, it is necessary to model this component
and subtract it from the non-eclipsed spectrum in order to properly
estimate the bolometric luminosity of the X-ray pulsar.

Hence, we ﬁrst analyzed all the XMM-Newton data in which
the eclipse was present (8 observations in 2008, 2011 and 2013).
We stacked together all the EPIC-pn data of the eclipses for a total
exposure of ∼30 ks, and we did the same for the EPIC-MOS1 and
MOS2 data. We ﬁtted together the resulting pn and MOS spectra
with the sum of three Mekal components (Mewe et al. 1985) with
temperatures of 0.1, 0.6 and 4 keV and abundances ﬁxed at those
of HD 49798 (Mereghetti & La Palombara 2015). This model was
then included as a ﬁxed component in all the ﬁts of the non-eclipsed
X-ray emission described below.

We then summed all the XMM-Newton data (from 2002 to
2014) excluding the time intervals corresponding to the pulsar
eclipse. This resulted in a total exposure of ∼ 90 ks. These stacked
spectra (one for each camera) were ﬁtted with a blackbody plus
powerlaw model, including as a ﬁxed component the eclipse model.
The resulting best-ﬁt values of the spectral parameters are given
in Table 3. Varying the model parameters within their 3σ c.l. re-
gions (see Fig.3), we found that the bolometric ﬂux of the black-
body component is constrained within the range (3 − 5) × 10−12
erg cm−2 s−1. The ﬂux of the power-law component depends on the
considered energy range, but it is at most ∼ 2 × 10−13 erg cm−2
s−1 (corrected for the interstellar absorption), even considering the
wide energy range 0.01-10 keV. Therefore, the power-law compo-
nent gives only a minor contribution to the total ﬂux and we can
conclude that the total accretion-powered luminosity, LX, is in the
range (2 ± 0.5) × 1032 (d/650 pc)2 erg s−1.

3 DISCUSSION

Our discovery of a long term spin-up conﬁrms that the pulsar com-
panion of HD 49798 is accreting mass. From the observed value
˙ν = 1.24× 10−17 Hz s−1, we can estimate the amount of speciﬁc an-
gular momentum which is accreted by the compact object, which,
using the relation LX = GM ˙M/R, can be written as:

ming all the XMM-Newton observations (pn+MOS). The estimated back-
ground contribution has been subtracted and the proﬁles have been normal-
ized to the average count rate.

2.2 Spectral analysis and luminosity

In this subsection we reassess the total accretion-powered luminos-
ity of the HD 49798 companion, exploiting all the available data
and taking into account the uncertainties in the spectral parame-
ters derived from the ﬁts. This is particularly important since, due
to the very soft spectrum, a large fraction of the luminosity might
be emitted at energies smaller than ∼0.2 keV, below the observed
X-ray range. X-rays from this system are also detected during the
eclipse. They are most likely emitted in the wind of HD 49798 and
it is reasonable to assume that they are present during the whole or-

These values should be compared with the speciﬁc angular mo-
mentum that can be provided by the inﬂow of the accreting matter.
Estimates of the speciﬁc angular momentum in the case of wind
accretion are subject to many uncertainties because the properties
of the ﬂow of the matter gravitationaly captured by the compact ob-
ject moving through the wind of the companion are not well known.
Estimates have been made by diﬀerent authors (see, e.g., Illarionov
& Sunyaev 1975; Shapiro & Lightman 1976; Wang 1981; Ruﬀert
1997) under some simplyﬁng hypothesis which might not apply
in our case. However, we can take as a reasonable upper limit the
value jw ∼ ΩR2
G, where Ω is the orbital angular velocity and RG is
the Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius (RG = 2GM/V2
REL, where VREL
is the relative velocity between the compact object and the stellar
wind). In the case of HD 49798 we have :
jw = 5.4 × 1016
cm2 s−1
which, compared to eq. 3, shows that, in this simple wind-accretion
scenario, it is diﬃcult to obtain the observed spin-up rate if the
compact object is a WD.

The case of a wind-accreting NS is more favourable, but still
a rather small value of VREL is necessary to provide enough angu-
lar momentum (see eqs. 5 and 4). Furthermore, a small value of
VREL might be inconsistent with the observed luminosity. In fact
the accretion rate can be estimated from the relation

M(cid:12) yr−1 = 2 × 1017 g s−1 and an asymptotic wind velocity V∞ =

In view of these diﬃculties, we consider in the following the

Using these equations, we can derive the minimum magnetic

˙M > 2 × 1011 g s−1,

in the case of a WD,

in the case of a NS.

(15)

(14)

We can thus conclude that, in case of disk accretion, it is pos-
sible to obtain the observed spin-up rate both in the WD and NS
case, provided that the accretion rate is large enough. In the next
subsection we will discuss whether this requirement is consistent
with the observed X-ray ﬂux and the implications for the nature of
the compact object.

3.1 Nature of the compact companion star

As discussed above, in the case of a WD companion it is very diﬃ-
cult to obtain the observed spin-up rate, unless an accretion disk is
formed. This is more likely to happen if the mass donor is (nearly)
ﬁlling its Roche-lobe. The Roche-lobe in this system has a radius
RRL∼3 R(cid:12). Kudritzki & Simon (1978) estimated that the radius of
HD 49798 is RHD= 1.45±0.25 R(cid:12), based on a distance d=650 pc.
However, a larger distance is required in the WD interpretation (see
below) and, considering that the estimated radius scales linearly
with d, it is then possible that RHD ∼ RRL.

The constraints on the magnetic ﬁeld strength (eqs. 10 and
12) are compatible with the values observed in weakly magnetized
WDs (Ferrario et al. 2015). For example, a magnetic ﬁeld of ∼200
kG, would be suﬃciently large to produce the required torque, yet
giving RM < RCOR. However, the luminosity corresponding to the
minimum mass accretion rate given by eq. 14 can be reconciled
with the value derived in section 2.2 only if the source distance is

sidering the Galactic latitude of this star (b = −19◦), it could be
underestimated. The revised parallax of HD 49798, obtained with
Hipparcos (1.2±0.5 mas), corresponds to a distance of 830 pc.
However, this parallax measurement has a relatively small statis-
tical signiﬁcance and a distance up to 5 kpc is within the 2σ error.
If the compact companion of HD 49798 is a NS, the condition
on the minimum accretion rate derived from the torque requirement
(eq. 15) predicts an X-ray luminosity LX > 3 × 1031 erg s−1, con-
sistent with the observations. The NS dipole ﬁeld is constrained by
eqs. 11 and 13, which, for example, lead to 2×107 < BNS < 3×1010
G for ˙M = 1.5×1012 g s−1 (LX = 2×1032 erg s−1). This ﬁeld is rather
low when compared to those usually found in accreting pulsars in
high mass X-ray binaries (e.g., Revnivtsev & Mereghetti 2015) and
might be related to the particular evolution leading to a NS with a
hot subdwarf companion (Iben & Tutukov 1993). Another remark-
able aspect of this X-ray binary is the stability of the spin-up rate,
mantained for a time period longer than 20 years. All the known ac-
creting neutron stars in (high-mass) X-ray binaries show variations
in their spin-period derivative (see, e.g., Chakrabarty et al. 1997,
and references therein) and, to our knowledge, for none of them it
has been possible to obtain phase-connected timing solutions span-
ning such a long time interval of steady spin-up.
Finally, we note that the large radius of the emitting area de-
rived from the blackbody spectral ﬁt, RBB ∼ 40 (d/650 pc) km,
is also puzzling. Even allowing for the uncertainties in the best-ﬁt
parameters (Fig. 3), this value is larger than the radius of a NS,
while the high pulsed fraction suggests that the thermal emission
originates from a relatively small fraction of the star.

4 CONCLUSIONS

By phase-connecting XMM-Newton, S wi f t and ROS AT observa-
tions spanning more than 20 years, we have obtained the ﬁrst
measure of the spin-period derivative of the X-ray pulsar in the
HD 49798/RX J0648.0–4418 binary system. Although the mea-
sured spin-up rate of 2.15 × 10−15 s s−1 is rather large for an ac-
creting WD, the lack of a precise distance measurement does not
allow us to completely rule out this possibility and safely identify
the compact object in this system with a NS.

The WD interpretation requires the presence of an accretion
disk. This implies that the hot subdwarf is (nearly) ﬁlling its Roche-
lobe and/or that the distance and wind properties of HD 49798 are
diﬀerent from those derived from the optical/UV observations.

However, also the possibility that the compact companion of
HD 49798 is a NS is not without problems. If conﬁrmed, it would
indicate a binary with properties very diﬀerent from those of all the
other known neutron star X-ray binaries. This could be related to
the peculiar nature of the mass-donor star in this system, character-
ized by a stellar wind much weaker and with a diﬀerent composi-
tion than those of ordinary OB stars.

A precise measurement of the distance, as will be obtained
with the GAIA astrometric satellite, will make it possible to assess
the nature of the compact object in HD 49798/RX J0648.0–4418.
For example, a WD would be strongly disfavoured if the distance
is smaller than ∼4 kpc. In the meantime, it is worth to investigate
