Coherent dressing of a quantum two-level system provides access to a new quantum system with
improved properties - a different and easily tuneable level splitting, faster control, and longer
coherence times. In our work we investigate the properties of the dressed, donor-bound electron
spin in silicon, and probe its potential for the use as quantum bit in scalable architectures. The
two dressed spin-polariton levels constitute a quantum bit that can be coherently driven with an
oscillating magnetic ﬁeld, an oscillating electric ﬁeld, by frequency modulating the driving ﬁeld,
2ρ “ 9 ms,
or by a simple detuning pulse. We measure coherence times of T ˚
one order of magnitude longer than those of the undressed qubit. Furthermore, the use of the
dressed states enables coherent coupling of the solid-state spins to electric ﬁelds and mechanical
oscillations.

Coherent dressing of a quantum two-level system
has been demonstrated on a variety of systems, includ-
ing atoms [1], self-assembled quantum dots [2], super-
conducting quantum bits [3], and NV centres in dia-
mond [4]. In this context “dressing” means that an elec-
tromagnetic driving ﬁeld coherently interacts with the
quantum system, so that the eigenstates of the driven
system are the entangled states of the photons and the
quantum system. For the case of a single spin in a static
magnetic ﬁeld B0 that is driven with an oscillating mag-
netic ﬁeld B1, this means that the eigenstates are no
longer the spin-up and spin-down states, but the sym-
metric and antisymmetric superpositions of these states
with the driving ﬁeld (comp. Fig. 1b). These new eigen-
states are often termed polaritons and for a single elec-
tron spin, the name electron spin polariton would be ap-
propriate.

The motivation to take a two-level system into the
dressed basis is multifaceted.
The dressed system
possesses a level splitting proportional to the driving
strength, and can therefore be dynamically modiﬁed
and tuned to be in resonance with other quantum sys-
tems [4, 5, 6]. Furthermore, the continuous driving de-
couples the spin from background magnetic ﬁeld noise.
Even in highly coherent systems such as trapped atoms,
coherence times can be improved by two orders of mag-
nitude by dressing the states [7]. Finally, the change
in quantization axis unlocks new ways of operating on
a dressed qubit. A dressed qubit can be controlled by
changes in the bare spin Larmor frequency, allowing
manipulation using electric ﬁelds and strain via the hy-
perﬁne coupling in donor systems [8, 9]. This opens
up the possibility of coupling spins to the motion of a
mechanical oscillator when the transition frequency be-
tween dressed states becomes comparable to the oscilla-
tor’s frequency [10].

Because of these beneﬁts, it has been proposed to
use dressed states for quantum gates and memories for
quantum computing [7, 11, 12]. In these proposals, the
focus was on optically-dressed qubits in trapped atomic
ions, because dressing a qubit fundamentally requires
a high ratio between the driving ﬁeld and the intrin-
sic resonance linewidth, most easily achieved in optics

and trapped ions. Here, we demonstrate a microwave-
dressed spin qubit in the solid state, using a highly co-
herent 31P donor bound electron in silicon [13]. We
demonstrate that the use of dressed states, compared
to bare spin states, has several advantages for quantum
computation.

The 31P donor in silicon constitutes a natural two-
qubit system, where both the electron (indicated with
|Óy or |Òy) and the nuclear (|óy or |òy) spin states can be
coherently controlled by a magnetic ﬁeld B1 oscillating
at speciﬁc electron spin resonance (ESR) and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) frequencies. We fabricated
a device that comprises a single 31P donor in an isotopi-
cally puriﬁed 28Si epilayer [14], implanted [15] next to
the island of a single-electron-transistor (SET). The SET
is formed under an 8 nm thick SiO2 layer by biasing a
set of electrostatic gates (yellow in Fig. 1a). The dis-
tance between donor and SET island is „ 20p5q nm [8],
with a tunnel coupling of order 10 kHz. The device
is cooled by a dilution refrigerator (electron tempera-
ture Tel « 100 mK), and subject to a static magnetic
ﬁeld B0 “ 1.55 T applied along the [110] Si crys-
tal axis. Due to the Zeeman effect the electrochemi-
cal potential µ of the donor electron depends on its spin
state, with µÒ ą µÓ. Another set of gates (pink in
Fig. 1a) is used to tune the electrochemical potentials
of donor and SET island (µSET) to the readout position,
where µÒ ą µSET ą µÓ such that only an electron in
the |Òy state can tunnel out of the donor. The positive
donor charge left behind shifts the electrochemical po-
tential of the SET island and causes a current to ﬂow,
until a |Óy electron tunnels back onto the donor. This
spin-dependent tunneling mechanism is used to achieve
high-ﬁdelity, single-shot electron spin readout [16, 17],
as well as initialization of the donor electron spin into
the |Óy state. For coherent spin control, an oscillat-
ing magnetic ﬁeld B1 is delivered to the donor by an
on-chip, broadband transmission line terminating in a
short-circuited nanoscale antenna [18] (blue in Fig. 1a).
While manipulating the electron spin state, the gates are
tuned such that µÒ,Ó ă µSET, to ensure that the electron
cannot escape the donor.

1 Dressing the electron spin - Rabi
oscillations and Mollow triplets

Fig. 1b shows the energy level diagram of the elec-
tron spin subsystem. Naturally, we would draw the en-
ergy levels in the |Òy—|Óy basis which corresponds to
the spin picture, with electron spin transition frequency
¯hωe. Alternatively, we can draw them in the dressed
|N ` 1y—|Ny basis, where N is the total number of
excitations in the system. The state |Ny then consists of
the two degenerate states |Ó, ny and |Ò, n ´ 1y, where n
is the number of resonant photons in the driving ﬁeld.
For a non-zero spin-photon coupling, the dressed lev-
els are split into the entangled |`, Ny “ 1?
2p|Ó, ny `
|Ò, n ´ 1yq and |´, Ny “ 1?
2p|Ó, ny´|Ò, n ´ 1yq states
which differ in energy by the Rabi frequeny ¯hΩR “
2 γeB1, where γe is the gyromagnetic ratio of the elec-
¯h 1
tron and B1 is the amplitude of the oscillating driving
ﬁeld.

We can deﬁne the dressed spin states as the basis
states of a new qubit, the dressed qubit. Here, the states
|´y and |`y act as the computational basis states. Note

that we have omitted N, the number of excitations in the
system, as the electron is dressed by a classical driving
ﬁeld, where the number of photons n is very large and
its exact value is unimportant. We do, however, need to
take into account the magnitude of B1, which deﬁnes
the electron Rabi frequency ΩR and therefore the split-
ting between the |´y and |`y states.

There are two ways to demonstrate creation of
dressed states. The ﬁrst is by performing coherent Rabi
oscillations, which has been demonstrated on electron
and nuclear spins in many material systems for ensem-
bles [19, 20] and single spins [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. The
second is by measuring the Mollow triplet [1]. This,
however, is more difﬁcult, as the Mollow spectrum is
usually measured in transmission/absorption [2, 26, 3]
or ﬂuorescence/scattering [1, 27, 28] and requires a very
sensitive optical detector and outstanding background
suppression. Here, we implement a novel way to mea-
sure the Mollow spectrum, based on our high-ﬁdelity
control and spin readout. After initializing the donor
electron in the |Óy state, we use a resonant, high-power
microwave (MW) pulse (pump pulse) to perform a con-
trolled rotation of angle p2n ` 1q ¨ π, which rotates the

spin to the |Òy state. The pump pulse serves to create the
dressed states with splitting equal to the Rabi frequency
Ωpump. At the same time, a low-power microwave pulse
(probe pulse) of the same length is scanned over the res-
onance to probe the response of the driven spin to dif-
ferent frequencies.

We plot the results of this measurement in Fig. 2.
The different curves were recorded for different mi-
crowave powers. The pump power was increased from
Ppump “ ´4 dBm (at the source) to Ppump “ `8 dBm,
while the probe power was always kept 26 dB lower,
i.e. Pprobe “ Ppump ´ 26 dB. The length of the two
simultaneous pulses was chosen such that the resonant
pump pulse results in a 21π rotation of the electron
spin, whereas the probe pulse by itself would lead to
« π rotation when in resonance. When the probe fre-

quency is scanned over the resonance, the effect it has
on the driven spin nicely reproduces the expected Mol-
low triplet. The spectrum consists of a larger peak in the
middle and two smaller peaks split off by the Rabi fre-
quency Ωpump, corresponding to the four different tran-
sitions indicated in red, orange and yellow in Fig. 1b.
When increasing the microwave power, this splitting in-
creases due to the stronger drive, as expected. At the
same time, the width of the peaks increases due to the
higher probe power. The insets of Fig. 2 show stan-
dard Rabi experiments for the same microwave pow-
ers. Here, the dots correspond to the experimental re-
sult, while the red lines are ﬁts to a sinusoid. The ﬁts
allow us to extract the Rabi frequency from the oscil-
lations, in excellent agreement with the peak splitting

2 Dressed qubit initialization and

readout

All of our measurements are based on the initialization
of the electron spin in the |Óy state and readout of the
electron spin |Òy state via spin-dependent tunneling to
the SET island [17]. If we want to work with the dressed
qubit, we can continue using the same initialization and
readout, however, we need to convert the electron |Óy,
|Òy states into the dressed qubit |´y, |`y states and vice
versa. This can be done in two ways. The ﬁrst is to use
resonant π{2-pulses along the ´y1-axis in the frame of
the MW source (see Fig. S4a), which will convert |Óy
to |`y for initialization, and |`y to |Òy for readout. Be-
tween initialization and readout the spin needs to be res-
onantly driven about the x1-axis to keep it spin-locked
in the dressed picture [19]. The second is to start with
an off-resonant MW driving ﬁeld along the x1-axis, and
adiabatically reduce the detuning ∆ω “ ωMW ´ ωe be-
tween the MW frequency ωMW and the ESR frequency
ωe to zero. This will convert |Óy to |`y when reducing
∆ω for initialization, and |´y to |Òy when increasing
∆ω for readout (also see Fig. 3g).

where the quantization is determined by ΩR and the
coupling term by ∆ω. This offers a number of dif-
ferent methods to coherently control the dressed qubit.
In the following we will introduce four different meth-
ods based on (i) magnetic resonance, modulating ∆ω
at frequency ΩR via (ii) the Stark shift of ωe [8] and via
(iii) frequency modulation of ωMW, and (iv) pulsing ∆ω
high by changing ωMW for a short period of time.

3.1 Magnetic resonance

the easiest method to control

Experimentally,
the
dressed qubit is to apply a radiofrequency (RF) ﬁeld
B2 with frequency ωRF “ ΩR to the on-chip antenna.
Here, only the magnetic ﬁeld component perpendicular
to the quantization axis of the dressed qubit drives the
transition [29],1 and the dressed qubit Rabi frequency is
given by ΩRρ “ cospθq 1
2 ¯hγeB2, where θ is the angle
between the orientation of the external magnetic ﬁeld
B0 and that of the oscillating RF ﬁeld B2. Simulations
of the on-chip antenna [18] and the donor device [8] in-
dicate a non-zero B2z1 magnitude at the donor location,
with θ « 2˝.

We measure the spectral response of the dressed
qubit by scanning ωRF over the frequency range around
ΩR, and plot the results in Fig. 3a. Here, the blue cir-
cles are the experimental result, while the red line is a ﬁt
to Rabi’s formula. With ωRF “ ΩR we can also mea-
sure coherent Rabi oscillations of the dressed qubit (see
Fig. 3b) with ΩRρ “ 2.4 kHz.

In the Hamiltonian in the dressed basis (Eq. 3), the
off-diagonal terms (σx terms) directly depend on ∆ω.
1In principle another way of using magnetic resonace would be to use a second MW ﬁeld at ωe along y1 that is amplitude modulated at ΩR.

gates surrounding the donor 2, and we extract a shift
of dωe{dV “ ´167 kHz/V. We can exploit the Stark
shift to modulate ∆ω at the dressed qubit’s resonance
frequency ΩR to electrically drive Rabi oscillations of
the dressed qubit. As this control method makes use of
a local electric gate to modulate ωe, it is immediately
compatible with scalable quantum computing architec-
tures where the global driving ﬁeld is kept unchanged
during gate operations (see Sec. 5).

For the measurement we connect the RF source di-
rectly to the gates to supply the oscillating electric ﬁeld
E2. For an RF power of PRF “ `6 dBm at the
source, and ´30.5 dB of attenuation, we obtain PRF “
´24.5 dBm at the gates. This power translates to a volt-
age V50Ω “ 18.8 mV and the voltage applied to the gate
is Vgate “ 2V50Ω “ 37.6 mV. The shift in frequency is
then ∆ωe “ Vgatep´167 kHz/Vq “ 6.2 kHz, which re-
sults in a dressed qubit Rabi frequency ΩRρ “ 1

the experimentally obtained Rabi oscillations in Fig. 3d.

with our prediction.

As an alternative to electrical modulation of ∆ω via
the Stark shift, we can also modulate ∆ω by frequency
modulation (FM) of ωMW. The FM feature in our MW
source provides a simpler way to experimentally imple-
ment this method, albeit with the lack of the scale-up
potential provided by electric resonance (see Sec. 3.2).
This is because one has to keep track of the refer-
ence frequency deﬁning the rotating frame, given by
ωMW. Another advantage of FM control is the much
larger achievable Rabi frequency. The effective driving
strength is only limited by the FM depth of the source
and can in principle reach the regime where the driving
strength exceeds the qubit splitting, ΩRρ ą ωRF.

In Fig. 3e,f we plot the dressed qubit Rabi chevron
pattern and spectrum (the red line is a ﬁt to Rabi’s for-
mula), respectively. For these measurements, the output
of an RF source is connected directly to the FM input of
the MW source. The modulation amplitude ∆ωRF can
then be controlled by the power of the RF source and the
FM bandwidth of the MW source, and ΩRρ “ 1
2 ∆ωRF.

3.4 Detuning pulse

The fourth and ﬁnal method of dressed qubit control
that we have investigated is realized by pulsing the de-
tuning ∆ω from 0 to a ﬁnite value for a short amount
of time. For ∆ω " ΩR, the eigenstates are the spin
basis states, and the dressed |`y state will nutate into
the dressed |´y state performing a Rabi oscillation (see
Fig. 3g) with ΩRρ “ ∆ω. This control method is based
on the same principle as the control of the state of the
Cooper pair box [30] or the singlet-triplet qubit in semi-
conductor double quantum dots [31, 32, 33]. In princi-
ple, it is equivalent to pulse ∆ω by tuning ωe or ωMW,
albeit with the same limitations as for FM control (see
Section 3.3). For our current sample design we can only
reach ∆ω " ΩR by pulsing ωMW, which is why we
limit our experiments to this case. With an optimized
gate layout we could also use local electric ﬁeld control
in a scalable manner.

In Fig. 3h, we plot the Rabi frequency of the dressed

qubit ΩRρ as a function of ∆ω during the detuning
pulse. For large detunings when ∆ω " ΩR “ 460 kHz
the dressed qubit Rabi frequency follows ΩRρ “ ∆ω.
This implies that the dressed qubit’s Rabi frequency
ΩRρ is larger than its level splitting ΩR.
In fact,
ΩRρ “ 10 MHz corresponds to gate operation times,
one order of magnitude shorter than those normally ob-
tained with pulsed ESR on the bare electron spin in our
lab. However for smaller ∆ω „ ΩR, ΩRρ tends to-
wards ΩR and the amplitude of the Rabi oscillations
decreases. This behaviour is well described by Rabi’s
formula, and the red line in Fig. 3h is simply calculated
as ΩRρ “
R. The raw data for this plot is
presented in Fig. S3.

To obtain T ˚

We now take a look at the dressed qubit’s lifetime T1ρ
and coherence times T ˚
3. As the longitudi-
nal decay time T1ρ in the driven frame is dependent on
noise of frequency ΩR, it is often used for noise spec-
troscopy measurements (see Refs. [34, 35, 36] and sec-
tion S5). We perform T1ρ measurements for different
Rabi frequencies ΩR. One example of a decay trace for
ΩR “ 50 kHz is shown in Fig. 4a, with the inset show-
ing the pulse sequence used. The decay curve yields

observe a decrease in T1ρ (see section S5 and Fig. S4c).
2ρ, we measure the free induction decay
in two different ways. In Fig. 4b (upper panel) we look
at the decay of the Rabi oscillations of the driven elec-
tron spin. This is equivalent to the free precession in
the driven frame. While the zoom-in shows the actual
Rabi oscillations, we can estimate the decay of the en-
velope from the main plot. The red lines correspond to

and NV centres in diamond [10, 39, 40]. The improve-
ment of the coherence times is achieved by the intrin-
sic insensitivity of the dressed states to magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations. Compared with dynamical decoupling se-
quences, where effects of a ﬂuctuating background are
refocussed at speciﬁc times, the dressed spin state pro-
vides continuous protection from decoherence.

The coherence time can be extended using dynam-
ical decoupling and in Fig. 4d we present the results

5 Scalability

The use of the dressed spin states as qubit states pro-

operations [41, 8]. This is because the dressed qubit
can be controlled using local electric gates that apply
an oscillating electric ﬁeld (see Section 3.2) or electric
ﬁeld pulses (see Section 3.4). The electric ﬁeld Stark
shifts the gyromagnetic ratio and the hyperﬁne coupling,
which are terms occupying the off-diagonal elements in
the driven qubit Hamiltonian (Equ. 3).

Coupling of two dressed qubits and the realization
of two-qubit logic gates can be realized by spin-spin
coupling via Hartmann-Hahn double resonance [5, 6, 4].
Considering two spins with slightly different hyperﬁne
couplings due to Stark or strain shifts, both can be
dressed with microwave ﬁelds resonant with their tran-
sition frequencies ωe1 ‰ ωe2, creating dressed qubits
with level splittings ΩR1 and ΩR2, respectively. By
choosing the two driving powers appropriately, the two
dressed qubits can be tuned in resonance with each other
(ΩR1 “ ΩR2), and coupled via exchange coupling or
magnetic dipolar coupling [5]. Although smaller than
exchange coupling for small distances, magnetic dipo-
lar coupling decays more slowly, making it the domi-
nant coupling mechanism for distances exceeding a few
tens of nm. At a donor separation of 50 nm, a coupling
strength of up to 400 Hz is achievable, allowing a num-
ber of gate operations to be conducted within the coher-
ence time of the dressed qubit, assuming dynamical de-
coupling. Furthermore, if a pair of quantum systems can
be dressed by the same driving ﬁeld, a hybrid dressed
state can be created that is insensitive to both amplitude
and phase noise in the continuous driving ﬁeld [12].

Another interesting property that is enabled in the
dressed basis is coupling of the spin states to strain in
the silicon crystal lattice [9], which opens the possibility
to coherent qubit control by mechanical means [42, 43],
and coherent spin-phonon dynamics [44, 45]. One could
even envision coupling the dressed spins to nanome-
chanical oscillators [10], and realize long-distance spin-
spin coupling via the quantized modes of the oscilla-
tor. For this coupling scheme, a ﬁrst MW ﬁeld at ωMW1
would supply the dressing of the qubit with level split-
ting ΩR1, while a local electric gate would control the
dressed single qubit rotations via an oscillating electric

ﬁeld. A DC electric ﬁeld could then be used to Stark-
shift the spin transition into resonance with a second
MW ﬁeld at ωMW2 ‰ ωMW1 with strength ΩR2 ‰
ΩR1. This second MW drive would enable coupling to
the nanomechanical oscillator, by bringing the dressed
qubit into resonance with the oscillator’s frequency at
ωr “ ΩR2.

6 Summary & conclusions

In conclusion, our work demonstrates the use of the
dressed states of an electron spin on a phosphorus donor
in silicon as a qubit. We ﬁrst prove the existence of
dressed states by observing Mollow triplets in a pump-
probe experiment and performing Rabi oscillations. We
demonstrate 4 different control methods of the dressed
qubit, of which two are compatible with scalable quan-
tum computing architectures, one results in faster gate
operations than those obtainable with pulsed spin reso-
nance on the bare electron spin, and one achieves Rabi
frequencies larger than the level splitting of the sys-
tem. This variety of control methods is available due
the dressed basis, which also unlocks coupling to elec-
tric ﬁelds and lattice strain, opening promising avenues
for future research and applications. Furthermore, we
ﬁnd coherence times that are one order of magnitude
2ρ “ 2.4 ms and
longer that those of the bare spin, with T ˚
2ρ “ 9.2 ms. Overall, this work provides a pathway
T Hahn
to apply to a solid-state platform some advanced con-
trol methods traditionally reserved to optical and atomic
systems, greatly expanding the potential of donor spin
qubits for applications in quantum information process-
ing and nanoscale research.

ters: 200 Hz second-order RC ﬁlters for DC biased
lines, and 80 MHz seventh-order Mini-Circuits LC
ﬁlters for pulsed voltage lines. The ﬁlter assemblies
were placed in copper enclosures, ﬁlled with cop-
per powder, and thermally anchored to the mixing
chamber. DC voltages were applied using optoiso-
lated and battery-powered voltage sources, connected
to the cold ﬁlter box via twisted-pair wires. Voltage
pulses were applied using an arbitrary waveform gen-
erator (LeCroy ArbStudio 1104), connected to the ﬁl-
ter box via semi-rigid coaxial lines. MW excitations
were generated using either an Agilent E8257D ana-
log or an Agilent E8267D vector signal generator, and
RF excitations were produced by an Agilent MXG
N5182A vector signal generator. Both excitation sig-
nals were combined using a power-combiner and fed
to the MW antenna via a CuNi semi-rigid coaxial ca-
ble, with attenuators at the 1.5 K stage (10 dB) and
the 20 mK stage (3 dB). The SET current was mea-
sured by a Femto DLPCA-200 transimpedance am-
pliﬁer at room temperature, followed by a ﬂoating-
input voltage post-ampliﬁer, a sixth-order low-pass
Bessel ﬁlter, and acquired using a PCI digitiser card
(AlazarTech ATS9440). For electron spin experi-
ments the state is always initialized spin-down and
all of our plots were produced by taking the spin-up
proportion from 100 ´ 200 single-shot measurement
repetitions per point.

S1 Device Fabrication

The device was fabricated on a 0.9 µm thick epilayer
of isotopically puriﬁed 28Si (800 ppm residual 29Si
concentration), grown on top of a 500 µm thick natSi
wafer [1]. Single-atom qubits were selected out of
a small group of donors implanted in a region adja-
cent to the Single-Electron-Transistor (SET). In this
device, P`
2 molecular ions were implanted at 20 keV
energy in a 100ˆ100 nm2 window. All other nanofab-
rication processes were identical to those described in
detail in Ref. [2], except for a slight modiﬁcation in
the gate layout to bring the qubits closer to the mi-
crowave antenna and provide an expected factor 3ˆ
improvement in B1 (see Fig. 1a and Ref. [3] for exact
gate layout).

S2 Experimental Setup

The sample was mounted on a high-frequency printed
circuit board in a copper enclosure, thermally an-
chored to the cold ﬁnger of an Oxford Kelvinox 100
dilution refrigerator with a base temperature Tbath “
20 mK. The sample was placed in the center of a
wide-bore superconducting magnet, oriented so that
the B0 ﬁeld was applied in the plane of the silicon
chip, along the [110] crystal axis, and perpendicular
to the short-circuit termination of the MW antenna.
The magnet was operated in persistent mode while
also feeding the nominal current through the exter-
nal leads. We found that removing the supply cur-
rent while in persistent mode led to a very signiﬁcant
magnetic ﬁeld and ESR frequency drift, unacceptable
given the intrinsic sharpness of the resonance lines of
our qubit. Conversely, opening the persistent mode
switch led to noticeable deterioration of the spin co-
herence, most visible as a shortening of T ˚
2 in Ramsey
experiments.

Room-temperature voltage noise was ﬁltered us-
ing an anti-inductively wound coil of thin copper wire

the Mollow triplet can be clearly seen. For shorter
pulse lengths, the probe pulse has a smaller effect on
the electron spin, and produces only small dips in the
spectrum.

S3 Mollow Triplet Measurements

In addition to the data presented in the main text
(Fig. 2), we recorded some spectra where the mi-
crowave pulse length was varied (Fig. S1) and where
the probe power was varied (Fig. S2).

Pprobe “ ´18 dBm were kept constant for all mea-
surements. The pump pulse always rotates the elec-
tron spin spin by p2n ` 1q ¨ π from the |Óy to the |Òy
state for all of the chosen pulse lengths. The simul-
taneous probe pulse at Pprobe “ Ppump ´ 26 dB ro-

Pulse

One of the four methods to control the dressed qubit
is realized by pulsing the detuning ∆ω “ ωMW ´ ωe
to a ﬁnite value for a short amount of time before ∆ω
is pulsed back to zero. This means that the driving
ﬁeld and the electron spin will rotate at different fre-
quencies ωMW ‰ ωe, and accumulate a phase term
(like a z-gate). This constitutes a qubit rotation in

ways larger than ΩR “ 460 kHz, albeit with a de-
crease in the amplitude of the Rabi oscillations when
∆ω À ΩR. We plot the supporting raw data for
this plot in Fig. S3. The panels show the Rabi os-
cillations obtained from ∆ω “ 0.25 MHz ă ΩR at
the bottom, to ∆ω “ 2.8 MHz ą ΩR at the top.
The frequency of the oscillations follows the formula

lifetime and noise

spectroscopy in the driven frame

The dressed spin state offers an interesting method to
perform noise spectroscopy. As the longitudinal de-
cay T1ρ is dependent on the noise that is perpendicu-
lar to the quantization axis of the quantum state and
resonant with the level splitting, T1ρ depends on ΩR.
T1ρpΩRq reﬂects the spectrum of the magnetic noise
in Z-direction, as any noise in Y-direction at ΩR will
get averaged out [4, 5]. This means that the dressed
qubit can be used as highly sensitive probe for mag-
netic ﬁelds oscillating at frequency ΩR [6], and for
the detection of individual nuclear spins [7].

In Fig. S4a,b we compare the spin depolarization
dynamics in the rotating frame and the driven frame,

quantization axis of the qubit (indicated in green) is
oriented along the z1-axis, and longitudinal decay T1
occurs from the north pole to the south pole of the
Bloch sphere (grey arrow). During free precession
the spin would be static in the rotating frame, pointing
somewhere along the x1 ´ y1-plane (shaded in cyan)
and transverse depolarization T2 would occur from
the equator towards the centre of the Bloch sphere
(dark blue arrows) 4. In the driven frame (Fig. S4b),
we assume a driving ﬁeld along the X-axis which
constitutes the quantization axis here (indicated in
green). Longitudinal decay T1ρ now occurs from ˘X
to the centre of the Bloch sphere (grey arrows), as the
|`y-|´y level splitting is much smaller than the ther-
mal energy at „ 100 mK. During free precession the
state is static in the double rotating frame (i.e. the ref-
erence frame that rotates around B0 and B1), pointing
somewhere along the Y ´ Z-plane (shaded in cyan).
Transverse depolarization T2ρ then occurs from there
to the centre of the Bloch sphere (dark blue arrows).
We perform T1ρ measurements in the driven
frame for different Rabi frequencies ΩR. Varying ΩR
allows us to map out T1ρpΩRq (see Fig. S4c). This
method offers access to the noise spectrum in a higher
frequency range as compared to the standard spec-

was limited to frequencies below 50 kHz, dictated by
the inverse of the minimum interval between pulses.
For ΩR ă 100 kHz, we measure T1ρ ą 1 s, but for
larger ΩR this value reduces to T1ρ „ 120 ms. Earlier

namical decoupling [8] showed white noise between
10and 50 kHz. This was attributed to broadband ther-
mal noise that would not give rise to an increase in
noise amplitude at higher frequencies. An explana-
tion for the apparent increase in noise power above
100 kHz in the T1ρ measurement could be the increas-
ing inﬂuence of amplitude ﬂuctuations of B1 when
ΩR is increased. This is because B1 has a component
B1z parallel to the external magnetic ﬁeld B0.
