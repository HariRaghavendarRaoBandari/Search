Non-thermal WIMPs and Primordial Black Holes

(Dated: March 2, 2016)

Non-thermal histories for the early universe have received notable attention as they are a rich
source of phenomenology, while also being well motivated by top-down approaches to beyond the
Standard Model physics. The early (pre-BBN) matter phase in these models leads to enhanced
growth of density perturbations on sub-Hubble scales. Here we consider whether primordial black
hole formation associated with the enhanced growth is in conﬂict with existing observations. Such
constraints depend on the tilt of the primordial power spectrum, and we ﬁnd that non-thermal
histories are tightly constrained in the case of a signiﬁcantly blue spectrum. Alternatively, if dark
matter is taken to be of non-thermal origin we can restrict the primordial power spectrum on scales
inaccessible to CMB and LSS observations. We establish constraints for a wide range of scalar masses
(reheat temperatures) with the most stringent bounds resulting from the formation of 1015 g black
holes. These black holes would be evaporating today and are constrained by FERMI observations.
We also consider whether the breakdown of the coherence of the scalar oscillations on sub-horizon
scales can lead to a Jean’s pressure preventing black hole formation and relaxing our constraints.
Our main conclusion is that primordial black hole constraints, combined with existing constraints on
non-thermal WIMPs, favor a primordial spectrum closer to scale invariance or a red tilted spectrum.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The post-inﬂationary universe prior to Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) lacks any direct connection
to cosmological observations. Given the absence
of data, it is typically assumed that inﬂationary
reheating quickly led to a thermal universe prior
to BBN. Then one calculates the consequences –
such as the relic abundance of thermal dark matter
(DM) with Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs) being a feasible candidate.

Non-thermal histories provide a well-motivated
alternative [1–3]. These theories arise naturally in
supergravity and string theory based approaches to
beyond the Standard Model physics. Non-thermal
histories lead to a universe that is matter domi-
nated prior to BBN due to the coherent oscilla-
tions of scalar (moduli) ﬁelds, which decay late due
to their weak (gravitational strength) couplings.
They also provide a rich and interesting source
of DM phenomenology.
In these models thermal
WIMPs freeze-out during the scalar dominated pe-
riod. Later, when the scalar ﬁelds decay and re-

heat the universe again, they provide an additional
source of DM in the form of non-thermal WIMPs
[3]. The non-thermal WIMPs typically provide the
dominant source of DM and their self annihilation
rates can be many orders of magnitude larger than
that of thermal WIMPs. This leads to new ex-
pectations for direct and indirect detection exper-
iments as well as other probes of the microscopic
nature of DM [3]. In addition, contrary to a ther-
mal history, DM and scalar perturbations will grow
during the non-thermal phase [4, 5]. This can lead
to an additional enhancement of DM sub-structure
on small scales and has important implications for
indirect detection signals and the process of struc-
ture formation [4–8].

In this paper, we want to consider whether the
growth of scalar perturbations during the non-
thermal phase leads to the over-production of Pri-
mordial Black Holes (PBHs). Observational con-
straints on PBHs and their evaporation products
provide a way in which to probe the nature of the
post inﬂationary universe prior to BBN1. The for-
mation rate of PBHs depends on the evolution of
the universe and the primordial power spectrum on

scales that are not probed by Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure
(LSS) observations. Observations favor a primor-
dial ‘red spectrum’ with increasing power on large
scales and with a scalar tilt n = 0.968± 0.006 [12].
For a strictly red spectrum, the average initial am-
plitude of perturbations at horizon entry will be
too weak to collapse to form PBH [13]. However,
CMB and LSS observations only probe the inﬂa-
tionary potential around 50 to 60 e-folds before
the end of inﬂation and within a window of about
nine e-folds. This corresponds to observable scales
k−1 (cid:39) 1 – 104 Mpc, telling us nothing about the
primordial spectrum on smaller scales. In fact, ax-
ion, hybrid, and hill-top inﬂation models all pro-
vide examples of models that can agree with CMB
scale observations and still predict more power on
small scales – a so-called ‘blue spectrum’ n > 1
toward the end of inﬂation. Given our lack of
knowledge of the primordial spectrum and of the
post-inﬂationary expansion, PBH formation is an
important possibility and can provide meaningful
constraints.

The enhanced growth of density perturbations
during a non-thermal history, leads to the predic-
tion that PBHs can form on sub-Hubble scales.
This is in stark contrast to the situation in a radi-
ation dominated universe where density perturba-
tions experience logarithmic growth and PBHs can
only form immediately as modes enter the horizon
– on smaller scales the process is halted by the
Jean’s pressure resulting from radiation. In a mat-
ter dominated universe the Jean’s pressure van-
ishes and PBH formation on small scales becomes
possible [14, 15].

In this paper we consider constraints on non-
thermal histories arising from the formation of
PBHs. In the next section we review how the en-
hanced growth of perturbations arises from an ex-
pansion dominated by an oscillating scalar ﬁeld.
In Section III we establish the expected mass frac-
tion of PBHs resulting from the enhanced growth
of perturbations on sub-Hubble scales and estab-
lish the expected mass range. We then consider the
constraints on the primordial power spectrum that
result by demanding a non-thermal phase prior to
BBN. In Section IV we combine our PBH con-
straints with existing constraints on non-thermal
WIMPs in SUSY based models. In particular, we
focus on the wino-like neutralino and ﬁnd that

2

combining existing indirect detection constraints
with our PBH bounds imply the scalar tilt is
bounded by n < 1.25 at high reheat tempera-
tures, but this constraint softens to about n < 1.4
at lower reheat temperatures due to the duration
of the matter phase. The longer the phase, the
weaker the constraints. In Section V we question
whether treating scalar oscillations as ‘dust’ is al-
ways appropriate in these models.
It is known
that scalar coherence can break down on sub-
Hubble scales resulting in a Jean’s pressure that
can disrupt PBH formation, and so weaken our
constraints. In the last section we conclude.

II. GROWTH OF PERTURBATIONS IN

THE NON-THERMAL PHASE

A. Background Evolution

We are interested in the background evolution
following the end of inﬂation. In non-thermal his-
tories, once the scalar mass becomes comparable
to the expansion rate coherent oscillations of the
scalar will lead to an eﬀectively matter dominated
phase. Within this regime we can describe the
cosmological background as a system of three in-
teracting ﬂuids with energy densities ρσ, ρR, and
ρX corresponding to the scalar, radiation, and DM
(DM) sectors, respectively. The relevant equations
are then2 [4, 5, 16]
˙ρσ = −3Hρσ − Γσρσ,
˙ρR = −4HρR + (1 − BX )Γσρσ +
˙ρX = −3HρX + BX Γσρσ − (cid:104)σv(cid:105)
where Γσ ∼ m3
p is the scalar decay rate and BX
is the branching ratio for decay to DM and we assume
all other decays result in relativistic particles. The DM
self annihilation rate is (cid:104)σv(cid:105), and we denote its energy
density in equilibrium as ˜ρX .
We will be interested in the regime with DM non-
relativistic T (cid:28) mX and so we can neglect the equi-

mann suppressed. The radiation density is given by
the temperature as ρR = π2g∗T 4/30 and we must take
care to track the non-standard relation between the
temperature and expansion rate resulting from entropy
production during scalar decays [16]. The Friedmann

where α runs over the values α = σ, R, X for each ﬂuid.
In the presence of DM annihilations the background
evolution was found in [5], which was in excellent agree-
ment with the earlier studies [4, 16] where DM anni-
hilations were absent. Deep within the non-thermal
phase the scalar energy density evolves as expected
ρσ ∼ 1/a3, whereas radiation and DM matter scale
as ∼ 1/a3/2 due to the changing entropy as a result
of scalar decays. The behavior of the system can be
seen in Figure 1, where we plot the relative contri-
bution of each ﬂuid to the total energy density and we
also include the scaling of the radiation temperature as
compared with the DM mass (recall T (cid:28) mX ). Given
the background evolution we now consider the growth
of cosmological perturbations.

B. Growth of Perturbations

The evolution of cosmological perturbations in a
non-thermal history were studied in [5]. In this paper
we are interested in the growth of the scalar perturba-
tions and whether this growth can lead to black hole
formation. Working in longitudinal gauge the scalar
metric perturbation is given by

ds2 = − (1 + 2Φ) dt2 + a(t)2 (1 − 2Φ) d(cid:126)x2.

batic initial conditions (isocurvature is negligible) the
solution on sub-Hubble scales (k (cid:29) aH) is δσ ∼ a(t)
and Φ ∼ Φ0 (constant) [5]. That is, scalar ﬁeld per-
turbations grow linearly during the non-thermal phase
in contrast to the case in a thermal history where they
only grow logarithmically3.

Given this enhanced growth of scalar perturbations
on sub-Hubble scales we now examine whether this can
result in an overproduction of primordial black holes.

(13)

(cid:19)

3 This is a familiar result from standard cosmology and
explains why the majority of structure formation is ex-
pected to take place after the time of radiation / matter
equality when the universe becomes matter dominated
[17].

4 This calculation has been reﬁned over the years, see e.g.
[18] and references within, but Carr’s original result still
provides an accurate enough estimate for many consider-
ations.

where w = p/ρ is the equation of state (w > 0), tH
is the time of Hubble radius crossing kH = aH H and
δM ≡ δM/M is the rms mass ﬂuctuation. This prob-
ability has an intuitive explanation. As a mode en-
ters the Hubble radius it will undergo growth due to
the inﬂuence of gravity, whereas this will be halted
below the Jean’s length due to the pressure p = wρ.
Thus, a mode must enter with a large enough ampli-
tude δM so that the initial perturbation can grow to
δM (tH ) ∼ O(1) and break away from the background
expansion before pressure eﬀects prevent further col-
lapse. For w ∼ O(1) (as in a radiation dominated
universe) the Jean’s radius nearly coincides with the
Hubble radius and so only perturbations with large ini-
tial amplitude and near the Hubble scale will collapse
to form PBHs.

This conclusion is altered in a matter dominated
phase.
Indeed, we saw in Section II B that if the
sound speed for the ﬂuctuations vanishes (correspond-
ing to no Jean’s pressure) that the scalar perturba-
tions grow.
In this case (13) no longer applies and
PBH formation can occur signiﬁcantly below the Hub-
ble radius [14, 15, 19]. Modes that enter following the
onset of scalar oscillations Hosc ∼ mσ will grow lin-
early δσ ∼ a(t) as discussed in Section II B. Given that
the scalar oscillations evolve as pressureless matter (or
‘dust’) the resulting mass fraction in PBHs is then [15]

β(M ) (cid:39) 2 × 10

−2 δ13/2
M .

(14)

The suppression and scaling are determined by cal-
culating the probability for an initial perturbation to
collapse in a strictly spherically symmetric manner
[20]. Whereas non-spherical collapse would result in
angular moment preventing further collapse below the
Schwarzschild radius. This expression gives the mass
fraction during the non-thermal epoch, which begins
near tosc ∼ H−1 (cid:39) m−1
σ and continues until the time
of reheating tr ∼ H−1 ∼ Γ−1 when the scalar has
mostly decayed to radiation and DM. Because PBHs
can form continuously during the non-thermal epoch
there will be a range of masses with the maximal mass
Mmax corresponding to the last PHB to form before
the peak of scalar decay and reheating. As discussed
in [15] it is convenient to express (14) in terms of the
mass fraction of PBHs in a universe without a non-
thermal phase β0(M ), since it is this quantity that is
typically constrained, the two are related by [15]

In the next section we will use constraints on β0 to
restrict model building in non-thermal histories.

A. Expected Mass Range of PBHs

The result of the last section (16) provides an im-
plicit constraint on model building from bounds on the
mass fraction of PBHs β0. In practice, we need to es-
tablish the mass dependence of δM , its relation to the
primordial power spectrum and the range of expected
PBH masses.
Given the primordial power spectrum Pζ ∼ kn−1
we can relate this to the density contrast through the
Poisson equation on sub-Hubble scales implying Pδ ∼
k4Pζ ∼ kn+3. We then use δk ∼ P 1/2
, and that (12)
implies M ∼ k−3 for a matter dominated universe and
we have δM (t) ∼ M−(n+3)/6. Finally, recall that for
usual PBH constraints, like those coming from (13),
the PBHs are taken to form on a particular scale (M )
at the time of Hubble radius crossing. Thus, we need
to relate δM to its value at Hubble crossing. Given the
result of Section IIB that δk(t) ∼ δt(t0)a(t) and using
kH = aH H ∼ t−1/3 during matter domination we ﬁnd

δ

δM (tH) ∼ M (1−n)/6.

(17)

δM (tr) = δM (tH )

= δM (tH )

The maximum mass allowed for a PBH during
the non-thermal epoch will result from formation at
the last moments before reheating tr when the Hub-
ble horizon is largest. However, unlike the standard
PBH calculation we must account for the sub-horizon
growth. Thus, the largest mass PBH will correspond
to δM (tr) ∼ O(1) where

The minimal PBH mass corresponds to the collapse

Using this result along with (19) the allowed range of
PBH formation falls within the range Mmin (cid:46) M (cid:46)
Mmax. We note that both (19) and (20) are only a
function of the scalar (moduli) mass. In non-thermal
SUSY WIMP models [1–3] this mass results from grav-
itational or anomaly mediated SUSY breaking and is
proportional to the gravitino mass up to a factor of
O(0.1 − 100) (which depends on the underlying pa-
rameters of the UV theory and is calculable). That
is, mσ ∼ m3/2 is a prediction of the theory and when
SUSY breaking (at least partially) addresses the elec-
troweak hierarchy problem we must require m3/2 ∼
TeV and so we expect mσ ∼ 1 − 100 TeV. In models
of Split SUSY [21], this requirement can be dropped
since scalar masses can be far above the electroweak
scale, but this implies the hierarchy problem must be
addressed by other means. In this paper we will con-
sider both proposals, and we choose two ﬁducial models
given in Table I.
The reheat temperature resulting from scalar decay
in these models is Tr ∼ (Γmp)1/2. As we review in Sec-
tion IV, this temperature is important for establishing
the expected microscopic properties of DM. We again
see from the expression for the reheat temperature that
the only new input into these models is the scalar mass
mσ, which makes a prediction for the expected range
of PBH masses.

B. Observational Constraints

Given the allowed range of PBH masses we now com-
pare to existing observational constraints. There are
a number of observations that may be used to con-
strain the mass fraction of PBHs – for a review see [10].
PBHs with masses around 1015 g will be evaporating
today and lead to gamma-ray and cosmic-ray signals
detectable by experiments like FERMI [22]. The evap-
oration time for a PHB is [10]

tevap (cid:39) 6.7 × 1017

s.

(21)

(cid:18) MPBH

(cid:19)3

1015 g

Thus, PBHs with masses far below 1015 g would have
evaporated in the early universe and altered processes
such as BBN. Finally, PHBs with mass larger than 1015
g (as well as any remnants of the evaporated, light
PBHs) are DM candidates and requiring their abun-
dance to be in agreement with observations provides
a constraint. The authors of [10] have gathered all
the existing bounds on PBHs for various mass ranges
and we will use their data to constrain our models.
For the mass range of PBHs we are interested in here,
the strongest bounds will result from BBN, CMB, and
gamma-ray detection experiments.

6

Given the range of expected masses in Table I, we
see that a number of the PBHs will evaporate prior to
BNN. However, the strongest constraints come from
the mass region near 1015 g – PBHs evaporating to-
day – and these are restricted by gamma-ray obser-
vations. Our results agrees with the analysis of [13],
except in that paper the authors took the lowest pos-
sible reheating temperature as the maximum temper-
ature we are considering here. This is because the au-
thors were concerned about the process of baryogene-
sis occurring, however this issue has been addresses in
non-thermal WIMP models [3, 23] and so we take the
lower bound on the reheat temperature to be set by
BBN (T (cid:39) 3 MeV). For the low reheat model our con-
straints correspond to the far right side of Figure 5 in
[13], where gamma-ray constraints were the strongest.

We now compare the predicted mass fraction of
PBHs in our model to the constraints as summarized5
in Fig. 9 of [10]. We calculate the mass fraction β(M )
in our model with (14) for two diﬀerent values of the
spectral index n. We follow the treatment in [13], by
normalizing δM in (14) to the CMB quadrupole so that
δM = δC (M/MC)(1−n)/6. As discussed above, in order
to compare our results with the constraints given for
a universe without a non-thermal phase, we have to
relate the predicted ranges for β to β0 using (15).

Fig. 2 gives our results for the two diﬀerent re-
heat temperatures and values of the spectral index.
We see for a blue spectrum of n = 1.4 we are over-
producing PBHs in a mass range between 1013 g to
1015 g, with the strongest constraints resulting from
PBHs which complete their evaporation process in the
present epoch, i.e. have a mass of ∼ 1015 g and so
would contribute to the extragalactic photon back-
ground as measured by Fermi LAT [22]. From the
FERMI data we can infer a limit on the density ra-
tio ΩPBH ≤ (9.8 ± 2.5) × 10−9, which corresponds to
a constraint β(M∗) < 6 × 10−26 where M∗ (cid:39) 1015 g
is the mass of PBH with an evaporation time of order
the age of the universe. The same method can be ap-
plied to generate a constraint from galactic gamma-ray
emissions. If PBHs of mass ∼ M∗ are present in the
galaxy we expect their density to be greater near the
galactic core. Therefore, they should contribute to the
galactic gamma-ray background and this contribution
would be separable from the extragalactic background

FIG. 2: The left (right) plot gives the constraints for the low (high) reheat model discussed in the text (see also
Table I). The restricted region is at the top (red) and the light (green) region represents models with a spectral
tilt of n = 1.4, whereas the darker lower region (blue) is nearly scale invariant at n = 1.1. We see that the
stronger constraints are for high reheat models (right panel) where the matter dominated phase is shorter. This
is because the evolution in a matter dominated universe softens PBH constraints as the density of black holes
and/or evaporation products will scale more slowly compared to that in a radiation dominated universe. This
eﬀect is more important than the fact that PBHs have more time to form during a longer matter phase. The
observational constraints are comprised of a number of diﬀerent observations and taken from the review [10].

because of anisotropy. Analysis of the data suggests
limits comparable to those of the above mentioned ex-
tragalactic background [10]. In Fig. 2, the left side of
the peak (mass range 2.5× 1013 g ≤ M ≤ 2.4× 1014 g)
corresponds to the constraints on PBHs which evapo-
rate after recombination and dampen small-scale CMB
anisotropies. This constraint has been calculated to be

β < 3 × 10−30(cid:0)M/1013 g(cid:1)3.1 (see [10] for details).

As expected, the results shown in Fig. 2 imply that
the bluer the spectrum the stronger the constraints.
This is because perturbations with a larger initial am-
plitude will more easily collapse to form PBHs after
horizon entry. One may have anticipated that the low
reheat scenario would have been more strongly con-
strained given the longer duration of the matter dom-
ination. However, this is not the case.
Instead the
phase helps soften constraints compared to PBH pro-
duction in a thermal universe because the change in
the background evolution from a radiation dominated
to a matter dominated universe changes the way in
which the radiation and PBH densities scale. That is,
for a matter dominated universe the fraction of the en-
ergy density in PBHs scales as ρPBH/ρm ∼ constant,

whereas in a radiation dominated universe the fraction
grows ρPBH/ρr ∼ a(t). This change in the scaling is
captured by (15) and noting that the decay rate scales
with the reheat temperature as Γ ∼ T 2
r /mp (recall β0
is the quantity data constrains and so we want to ﬁnd
β0 for β given by (14)) and we see that lower reheat
temperatures result in lower values of the ﬁnal mass
fraction. In the next section we examine how our PBH
constraints can be used to restrict non-thermal DM
model building.

IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSY WIMPS

When the scalar decays and reheats the universe
it dilutes any previous population of DM by a fac-
tor Ωcdm → Ωcdm(Tr/Tf )3, where Tf is the thermal
freeze-out temperature. This dilution is typically large
enough to render the existing abundance irrelevant.
This scaling can be understood from the fact that the

Since the relic density scales inversely with the annihi-
lation cross section, this implies that WIMP candidates
with annihilation cross sections larger than the canon-
ical value by a factor (Tf /Tr) can give the correct relic
density in a non-thermal history with the above com-
pensating factor. Examples of such WIMPs are the
winos and higgsinos of the Minimal Supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model (MSSM).

where the entropy density today is s0 = 2.78×108ρc/h2
and h is again the Hubble parameter in units of 100
km/s/Mpc. We chose a ﬁducial value of g∗ = 10.75
for the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at
the time of reheating, although this would increase for
reheat temperatures signiﬁcantly above an MeV.

Unlike the standard thermal result, (24) depends on
both the properties of the DM (mass and annihilation
rate) and on the mass of the decaying scalar (mσ). As
discussed in the previous section the scalar mass (and
so reheat temperature) is not a free parameter, but
related to the gravitino mass (m3/2). The mass of the
scalar (and so the relic density of DM) is controlled by
the need for SUSY to generate a hierarchy between the
electroweak and Planck scale.

We have chosen a ﬁducial value for the annihilation
rate in (24) that yields roughly the right amount of DM
for the hierarchy set by the choice of low-scale SUSY
breaking. The cross-section is three orders of magni-
tude higher than expected with a thermal history with
important experimental consequences, particularly for
indirect detection of DM experiments. Moreover, for
SUSY WIMPs this suggests the wino-like neutralino

FIG. 3: This plot gives the constraints relevant for
the wino DM scenario discussed in the text. The re-
stricted region is at the top (red) and the light (green)
region represents models with a spectral tilt of n = 1.4,
whereas the darker lower region (blue) is nearly scale
invariant at n = 1.1. We have considered a GeV
reheat temperature with mσ = 1.4 × 103 TeV and
Γ = 4.5 × 10−19 GeV. The allowed PBH mass range
then has a minimal mass of Mmin = 2.2×107 g, whereas
the maximal masses are given by Mmax = 5.7 × 1026
g and Mmax = 6.8 × 1028 g for n = 1.1 and n = 1.4,
respectively. We see that the formation of PBHs with
masses around M (cid:39) 1014 g are in tension with the
data.

temperature scales as6 T ∼ 1/a(t), while volumes scale
as ∼ a(t)3 (where a(t) is the scale factor). Although
thermal DM will be diluted by scalar decay we also
expect the scalar decay to produce DM.

If the production of WIMPs leads to a number den-
x = H/(cid:104)σxv(cid:105) (eval-
sity that exceeds the critical value nc
uated at T = Tr), then the WIMPs will quickly anni-
hilate down to this value, which acts as an attractor
[1]. The ﬁxed point value is evaluated at the reheat-

dominated epoch entropy is not conserved and this alters
the temperature / scale factor relation [16]. Here we will
work in the instantaneous decay approximation and refer
the reader to [5] for a more rigorous treatment. We do
not expect any signiﬁcant qualitative diﬀerences.

ios the wino would not lead to the appropriate relic
abundance.

Given the enhanced self-annihilation rate of the wino
we can use existing constraints from indirect detec-
tion experiments (such as FERMI) to place constraints
on the annihilation rate [5, 24, 25].
In fact, if we
consider single component DM, we can then use
(24) to place restrictions on the reheat temper-
ature (and so the scalar mass). That is, (24)
must agree with cosmological bounds set by Planck
Ωcdmh2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027 [26], and then we can
use FERMI constraints on the annihilation rate
to bound the smallest allowed reheat temperature.
This was done in [5, 24]. The authors of [5] found
the most rigid constraints by also including HESS
data, even when carefully accounting for astro-
physical uncertainties. They found that for the
wino to be a successful candidate the reheat tem-
perature must exceed a GeV. Given this result, we
can now consider a GeV scale model and ask what
PBH constraints imply.

Fig. 3 gives the constraints relevant for the wino
non-thermal DM scenario. The restricted region
is at the top (red) and the light (green) region
represents models with a spectral tilt of n = 1.4,
whereas the darker lower region (blue) is nearly
scale invariant at n = 1.1. We have considered a
GeV reheat temperature with mσ = 1.4× 103 TeV
and Γ = 4.5 × 10−19 GeV. The allowed PBH mass
range corresponds to a minimal mass of Mmin =
2.2× 107 g, whereas the maximal masses are given
by Mmax = 5.7×1026 g and Mmax = 6.8×1028 g for
n = 1.1 and n = 1.4, respectively. We see that the
formation of PBHs with masses around M (cid:39) 1014
g are in tension with the data.

Thus far we have considered constraints for ﬁxed
values of the reheating temperature and spectral
index. Now we consider constraints on the spec-
tral index in SUSY WIMP models by combining
our PBH constraints with existing constraints on
DM. Our results appear in Fig. 4 for a range of
reheating temperatures (scalar masses mσ). Re-
gions with reheat temperatures below 1 GeV are
ruled out by both BBN constraints, as well as the
FERMI/HESS constraints of [5]. Temperatures
above around 1000 TeV are forbidden for non-
thermal DM, since the mass must be less than this
scale due to unitarity constraints and so DM is
necessarily thermal in this region with mX (cid:28) Tr.

FIG. 4:
In this Figure we combine our PBH con-
straints with existing indirect detection bounds on non-
thermal SUSY WIMP models. Reheat temperatures
below around 1 GeV are ruled out by the indirect de-
tection bounds given in [5]. Above around 1000 TeV
the WIMPs would necessarily be thermal since masses
in excess of that scale would violate unitarity con-
straints and so in that region T > mX – DM is thermal.
The top red region represents the PBH constraints
from a variety of observations including gamma-rays,
CMB, and relic constraints all taken from the review
[10].

Thus, our main conclusion of this section is that re-
stricting to models with non-thermal DM we ﬁnd
that PBH constraints disfavor an extremely blue
spectrum and we ﬁnd n (cid:46) 1.3 − 1.2 for the spec-
tral tilt.

V. BREAKDOWN OF SCALAR

COHERENCE?

It is well known that a scalar coherently oscil-
lating about the minimum of its potential scales
as pressureless matter when averaged over a Hub-
ble time [27]. However, it is also known from both
investigations into axions [28] and in the context of
scalar ﬁeld DM / dark energy [29] that this approx-
imation can fail on sub-horizon scales. When this
breakdown occurs we can still use the perturbation
equations (8), but the assumption of w = cs = 0 is
no longer valid. In particular, (9) and (10) are no
longer appropriate, and if a ﬁnite sound speed ex-

length λJ ∼ csH−1, which can prevent the forma-
tion of structure on sub-Hubble scales – including
black holes.

To consider the case of non-vanishing sound
speed we begin by noting that for most of the non-
thermal history the energy density is dominated by
the scalar ﬁeld as seen in Figure 1. Although the
scalar density does not decrease noticeably during
this epoch, it does not mean that decay and annihi-
lation eﬀects are not important (e.g. this changes
the scale factor / temperature relation and how
radiation and DM evolve), but for the growth of
scalar perturbations these terms have little eﬀect
as long as the scalar is dominant [5] – so in what
follows we will neglect these terms. A further sim-
pliﬁcation can be made if we take the sub-Hubble
limit of these equations so that (11) reduces to the
usual Poisson equation

and the same average implies that (cid:104)w(cid:105)t = (cid:104) ˙w(cid:105)t = 0
just as in the case of axions7 [28].
We have seen that the strongest constraints
come from the PBHs with mass near M (cid:39) 1015 g.

7 We note that the sound speed c2

s = δp/δρ should not be
ad = ˙p/ ˙ρ = w−

confused with the adiabatic sound speed c2
˙w/(3H(1 + w)) which vanishes when we take the average.
In particular, we see on sub-Hubble scales that the sound
speed depends on momentum (is not homogeneous). The
two are related by c2
ad + wΓ/δ where Γ is the non-
adiabatic pressure perturbation. We refer the reader to
the review [28] for more details.

We now estimate whether the pressure eﬀects of
a non-zero sound speed could stop the formation
of these PBHs. First we will assume the PBHs
formed from the immediate collapse of modes as
they entered the horizon, so that there mass will be
set by the horizon mass M ∼ MH = 3m2
p/H. This
would be the situation for a universe with ﬁnite
equation of state [13] and we will justify making
this estimate below.

Given this assumption, we can solve to get the
−1
Hubble scale at this time H = 3m2
H and
the modes at horizon crossing are k = aH =
pM−1. Using this in (27) the sound speed
a 3m2
is then given by

(28)
which for very light scalars would imply ceff (cid:39) 1
and this could prevent collapse. However, in both
the low and high reheat models given in Table 1,
the scalar must be quite heavy. Using a PBH mass
of M = 1015 g we ﬁnd an eﬀective sound speed of
−13 (cid:28) 1 (Low Reheat), (29)
−21 (cid:28) 1 (High Reheat). (30)
That is, the sound speed is negligible and pressure
eﬀects will not tend to prevent PBH formation.

eff = 2.7 × 10
c2
eff = 4.2 × 10
c2

In arriving at this conclusion we have assumed
the perturbations collapse to form PBH as soon
as they enter the Hubble radius. We have seen
this need not be the case and in fact it is the sub-
Hubble evolution that leads to formation in non-
thermal histories. But in this case, the momen-
tum in (27) will be even smaller (as it redshifts
for each particular k). Thus, the estimate of the
sounds speed (and so pressure eﬀects) given above
are actually much more conservative than what we
expect in practice. The fact that the sound speed
is negligible except for very small masses is well
known from axion studies and warm DM [30]. In
conclusion, we ﬁnd for the range of scalar mass and
reheat temperatures considered here that the pres-
sure of the scalar ﬁeld results in a negligible eﬀect
on the formation of PBHs.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have seen that in non-thermal histories the
coherent oscillations of a scalar ﬁeld lead to an ef-

fectively matter dominated universe, and so once
density perturbations enter the horizon they will
grow linearly with the scale factor. This growth
leads to the formation of PBHs on sub-Hubble
scales, contrary to the thermal case where PBHs
only form from collapse near horizon crossing.

We constrained the PBH abundance and their
decay products through a number of experiments
and observations,
including gamma-ray, cosmic-
ray and CMB observations. The importance of
each type of constraint depends on the PBH mass
range, which we have calculated for the scalar
masses (and so reheat temperatures) relevant for
non-thermal WIMPs [3]. The strongest constraints
correspond to 1015 g PBHs, which are evaporating
today and are constrained by FERMI. The con-
straints imply that non-thermal DM models and
a primordial power spectrum with a signiﬁcantly
blue tilt are in conﬂict with the data. In partic-
ular, we have seen that when non-thermal SUSY
WIMPs make up all of the DM, the tilt of the
power spectrum at post-inﬂationary scales (prior
to BBN) must satisfy n (cid:46) 1.25 for high reheat tem-
peratures. We saw that this constraint becomes
weaker at low reheat temperatures, since the longer
the duration of the non-thermal phase the weaker
the constraints become due to the scaling of the
critical density in PBHs compared to the thermal

11

case. In the former case the ratio is ﬁxed, whereas
in the thermal case ρPBH/ρr ∼ a(t) grows.

We also considered whether taking into account
the breakdown of the coherence of the scalar
oscillations on sub-Hubble scales could lead to
pressure eﬀects preventing the formation of PBHs.
Given the large mass of the scalar – which is ﬁxed
by the underlying SUSY breaking – we ﬁnd that
pressure eﬀects are negligible. Our main conclu-
sion is that when PBH constraints are combined
with existing constraints on non-thermal DM
model building that a primordial spectrum closer
to scale invariance is preferred to that of a blue tilt.
