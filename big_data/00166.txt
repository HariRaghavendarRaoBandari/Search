ELLIPTIC GRADIENT ESTIMATES FOR A NONLINEAR

HEAT EQUATION AND APPLICATIONS

JIA-YONG WU

Abstract. In this paper, we study elliptic gradient estimates for a
nonlinear f -heat equation, which is related to the gradient Ricci soliton
and the weighted log-Sobolev constant of smooth metric measure spaces.
Precisely, we obtain Hamilton’s and Souplet-Zhang’s gradient estimates
for positive solutions to the nonlinear f -heat equation only assuming
the Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor is bounded below. As applications, we
prove parabolic Liouville properties for some kind of ancient solutions
to the nonlinear f -heat equation. Some special cases are also discussed.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background. This is a sequel to our previous work [26]. In that paper
we proved elliptic gradient estimates for positive solutions to the f -heat
equation on smooth metric measure spaces with only the Bakry-´Emery Ricci
tensor bounded below. We also applied the results to get parabolic Liouville
theorems for some ancient solutions to the f -heat equation. In this paper
we will investigate elliptic gradient estimates and Liouville properties for
positive solutions to a nonlinear f -heat equation (see equation (1.3) below)
on complete smooth metric measure spaces.

Recall that an n-dimensional smooth metric measure space (M n, g, e−f dv)
is a complete Riemannian manifold (M n, g) endowed with a weighted mea-
sure e−f dv for some f ∈ C ∞(M ), where dv is the volume element of the
metric g. The associated m-Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor [2] is deﬁned by

Ricm

f := Ric + ∇2f −

1
m

df ⊗ df

for some constant m > 0, where Ric and ∇2 denote the Ricci tensor and
the Hessian of the metric g. When m = ∞, we have the (∞-)Bakry-´Emery
Ricci tensor

Ricf := Ric + ∇2f.

for any u ∈ C ∞(M ). When m < ∞, (1.1) could be viewed as the Bochner
formula for the Ricci tensor of an (n + m)-dimensional manifold. Hence
many geometric and topological properties for manifolds with Ricci tensor
bounded below can be possibly extended to smooth metric measure spaces
with m-Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor bounded below, see for example [16, 19].
When m = ∞, the (∞-)Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor is related to the gradient
Ricci soliton

Ricf = λ g

for some constant λ, which plays an important role in Hamilton’s Ricci ﬂow
as it corresponds to the self-similar solution and arises as limits of dilations
of singularities in the Ricci ﬂow [11]. A Ricci soliton is said to be shrinking,
steady, or expanding according to λ > 0, λ = 0 or λ < 0. On the gradient
estimate, the smooth function f is often called a potential function. We
refer [5] and the references therein for further discussions.

On smooth metric measure space (M, g, e−f dv), the f -Laplacian ∆f is

deﬁned by

which is self-adjoint with respect to the weighted measure. The associated
f -heat equation is deﬁned by

∆f := ∆ − ∇f · ∇,

(1.2)

∂u
∂t

= ∆f u

If u is independent of time t, then it is f -harmonic function. In the past few
years, various Liouville properties for f -harmonic functions were obtained,
see for example [3], [16], [17], [21], [23], [25], [27], [28], and the references
therein. Recently, the author [26] proved elliptic gradient estimates and
parabolic Liouville properties for f -heat equation under some assumptions
of (∞-)Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor.

where a ∈ R, on complete smooth metric measure spaces (M, g, e−f dv) with
only the Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor bounded below. Here we assume M has
no boundary. It is well-known that all solutions to its Cauchy problem exist
for all time. Under the assumption of Ricf , we shall prove local elliptic
(Hamilton’s type and Souplet-Zhang’s type) gradient estimates for positive

solutions to the nonlinear f -heat equation (1.3). As applications, we prove
parabolic Liouville properties for the nonlinear f -heat equation (1.3).

Historically, gradient estimates for the harmonic function on manifolds
were discovered by Yau [30] and Cheng-Yau [7] in 1970s. It was extended to
the so-called Li-Yau gradient estimate for the heat equation by Li and Yau
[15] in 1980s. In 1990s, Hamilton [10] gave an elliptic type gradient estimate
for the heat equation on closed manifolds, which was later generalized to
the non-compact case by Kotschwar [13]. In 2006, Souplet and Zhang [22]
proved a localized Cheng-Yau type estimate for the heat equation by adding
a logarithmic correction term.
Integrating Hamilton’s or Souplet-Zhang’s
gradient estimates along space-time paths, their estimates exhibit an inter-
esting phenomenon that one can compare the temperature of two diﬀerent
points at the same time provided the temperature is bounded. However,
Li-Yau gradient estimate only provides the comparison at diﬀerent times.

Equation (1.3) has some relations to the geometrical quantities. On one
hand, the time-independent version of (1.3) with constant function f is
linked with gradient Ricci solitons, for example, see [20, 29] for detailed
explanations. On the other hand, the steady-state version of (1.3) is closely
related to weighted log-Sobolev constants of smooth metric measure spaces
(Riemmann manifolds case due to Chung-Yau [8]). Recall that, weighted log-
Sobolev constants SM , associated to a closed smooth metric measure space
(M n, g, e−f dv), are the smallest positive constants such that the weighted
logarithmic-Sobolev inequality

ZM

u2 ln(u2) e−f dv ≤ SMZM |∇u|2 e−f dv

holds for all smooth function u on M satisfying RM u2e−f dv = Vf (M ).

In particular, the case of Euclidean space Rn equipped with the Gaussian
measure

e−f dv := (4π)− n

2 exp(cid:18)−|x|2

4 (cid:19) dx

is inequivalent to the original log-Sobolev inequality due to L. Gross [9].

If function u achieves the weighted log-Sobolev constant and satisﬁes

RM u2e−f dv = Vf (M ), that is,

SM = RM |∇u|2 e−f dv
RM u2 ln u2 e−f dv

= inf

φ6=0 RM |∇φ|2 e−f dv
RM φ2 ln φ2 e−f dv

.

Using the Lagrange’s method with respect to weighted measure e−f dv, we
have

−2∆f u

RM u2 ln u2 e−f dv − RM |∇u|2 e−f dv

(RM u2 ln u2 e−f dv)2 (cid:0)2u ln u2 + 2u(cid:1) + c1u = 0

for some constant c1. By the deﬁnition of SM , this can be reduced to

(1.4)

− ∆f u − SM (u ln u2 + u) + c2u = 0

4

JIA-YONG WU

for the constant

c2 =

c1

2 ZM

u2 ln u2 e−f dv.

Notice that multiplying (1.4) by u and integrating it with respect to the
weighted measure e−f dv, we have

ZM |∇u|2 e−f dv − SMZM

u2(ln u2 + 1) e−f dv + c2ZM

which implies SM = c2. Therefore (1.4) can be simpliﬁed as

u2 e−f dv = 0,

∆f u + SM u ln u2 = 0,

(1.5)
which is an elliptic version of (1.3). For (1.5), if Ricm
f ≥ 0, using (1.1)
instead of the classical Bochner formula for the Ricci tensor and following
Chung-Yau’s arguments [8], we immediately get

sup u ≤ e(n+m)/2,

|∇ ln u|2 + SM ln u2 ≤ (n + m)SM

and

where λ1 and d denote the ﬁrst nonzero eigenvalue of the f -Laplacian and
the diameter of (M n, g, e−f dv).

1.2. Main results. Our ﬁrst result gives a local Hamilton’s gradient esti-
mate for any positive solution to the equation (1.3).

Theorem 1.1. Let (M, g, e−f dv) be an n-dimensional complete smooth met-
ric measure space. For any point x0 ∈ M and R ≥ 2, Ricf ≥ −(n− 1)K for
some constant K ≥ 0 in B(x0, R). Let 0 < u(x, t) ≤ D for some constant D,
be a smooth solution to the equation (1.3) in QR,T ≡ B(x0, R)×[t0−T, t0] ⊂
M × (−∞,∞), where t0 ∈ R and T > 0.

x from base point x0.

Remark 1.2. Cao, Fayyazuddin Ljungberg and Liu [6] proved Li-Yau type
gradient estimates for equation (1.3) with constant function f ; our results
belong to the elliptic type. An distinct feature of Theorem 1.1 is that the
gradient estimates hold only assuming the (∞-)Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor is
bounded below (without any assumption on f ).
We also remark that our proof is a little diﬀerent from Yau’s original proof
[30]. In Yau’s case, the proof is to compute the evolution of quantity ln u,
then multiply by a cut-oﬀ function and apply the maximum principle. In our
case, we compute the evolution of quantity u1/3 instead of ln u. Moreover,
our proof not only applies some arguments of Souplet-Zhang [22], where
the maximum principle in a local space-time supported set is discussed, but
also uses some proof tricks of Bailesteanua-Cao-Pulemotov [1], Li [14] and
Wei-Wylie’s comparison theorem [23].

An immediate application of Theorem 1.1 is the parabolic Liouville prop-

erty for the nonlinear f -heat equation. Similar results appeared in [12].

Theorem 1.3. Let (M, g, e−f dv) be an n-dimensional complete smooth met-
ric measure space with Ricf ≥ 0.

(i) When a > 0, if u(x, t) is a positive ancient solution to equation (1.3)
(that is, a solution deﬁned in all space and negative time) such that
0 < u(x, t) ≤ e−2, then u does not exist.
(ii) When a < 0, let u(x, t) be a positive ancient solution to equation
(1.3). If e−2 ≤ u(x, t) ≤ D for some constant D < 1, then u does
not exist; if e−2 ≤ u(x, t) ≤ D for some constant D ≥ 1, then u ≡ 1.
(iii) When a = 0, if u(x, t) is a positive ancient solution to equation
(1.2) such that u(x, t) = o(cid:16)(cid:2)r1/2(x) + |t|1/4(cid:3)2(cid:17) near inﬁnity, then u

is constant.

Theorem 1.3 immediately implies the following result.

Corollary 1.4. Let (M, g, e−f dv) be an n-dimensional closed smooth metric
measure space with Ricf ≥ 0. If positive smooth function u(x) achieves the
weighted log-Sobolev constant SM and satisﬁes

then u(x) > e−2.

u2e−f dv = Vf (M ),

ZM

For more interesting special cases and applications of Theorem 1.1, see

Section 3 for furthermore discussion.

Our second result gives a Souplet-Zhang’s elliptic gradient estimate for
positive solutions to the nonlinear f -heat equation (1.3). The proof mainly
adopts the arguments of Bailesteanua-Cao-Pulemotov [1], Souplet-Zhang
[22] and Brighton [3] (see also [26]).

Theorem 1.5. Let (M, g, e−f dv) be an n-dimensional complete smooth met-
ric measure space. For any point x0 ∈ M and R ≥ 2, Ricf ≥ −(n− 1)K for
some constant K ≥ 0 in B(x0, R). Let 0 < u(x, t) ≤ D for some constant
D, be a smooth solution to f -heat equation (1.3) in QR,T ≡ B(x0, R)× [t0 −
T, t0] ⊂ M × (−∞,∞), where t0 ∈ R and T > 0.

Here, α := max{x|d(x,x0)=1} ∆f r(x), where r(x) is the distance function to
x from base point x0.

If a = 0, theorem recovers the result in [26]. We point out that, similar
to Theorem 1.1, gradient estimates of Theorem 1.5 also hold provided that
only the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor is bounded below.

Remark 1.6. In [24] the author proved similar estimates when m-Bakry-
´Emery Ricci tensor is bounded below. He also remarked that m-Bakry-
´Emery Ricci tensor could be replaced by (∞-)Bakry-´Emery Ricci tensor
(see Remark 1.3 (ii) in [24]). Professor Xiang-Dong Li pointed out to me
that the remark is not accurate because of the lack of global f -Laplacian
comparison except some special constraint of f is given. However, Theorem
1.5 corrects my previous remark and provides an answer to this question.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will give
some auxiliary lemmas and introduce a space-time cut-oﬀ function. These
results are prepared to prove Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.5. In Section 3,
we will give completely detail proofs of Theorem 1.1 by the classical Yau’s
gradient estimate technique. Then we will apply Theorem 1.1 to prove
Theorem 1.3 and Corollary 1.4. Meanwhile we will also discuss some special
cases of Theorem 1.1. In Section 4, we will adopt the arguments of Theorem
1.1 in [26] to prove Theorem 1.5.

2. Basic lemmas

In this section, we will give some useful lemmas, which are prepared to
prove Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.5 in the following sections. Consider the

Lemma 2.1. Let (M, g, e−f dv) be an n-dimensional complete smooth metric

some constant K ≥ 0 in B(x0, R). Let 0 < u(x, t) ≤ D for some constant

Proof. Following the computation method of [15], let e1, e2, ..., en be a local
orthonormal frame ﬁeld on M n. We adopt the notation that subscripts in
i, j, and k, with 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n, mean covariant diﬀerentiations in the ei, ej
and ek, directions respectively.

Diﬀerentiating ψ in the direction of ei, we have
ωj = hj · |∇h|2 + 2hhihij

(2.3)

8

and once more diﬀerentiating ψ in the direction of ei,

i hjj,
where hi := ∇ih and hijj := ∇j∇j∇ih, etc. Hence we have

∆ω = 2h|hij|2 + 2hhihijj + 4hihjhij + h2

∆f ω = ∆ω − h∇f,∇ωi

= 2h|hij|2 + 2hhihijj + 4hihjhij + h2

i hjfj
= 2h|hij|2 + 2hhi(∆f h)i + 2hRicf (∇h,∇h) + 4hihjhij + h2

By (2.2), we also have

Since Ricf ≥ −(n − 1)K for some constant K ≥ 0, then

Finally, we notice that if a ≥ 0, then 0 < h ≤ D1/3 and hence

If a < 0, then δ1/3 ≤ h ≤ D1/3 and hence

The above two cases imply the desired results.

Using this, we can get the following lemma, which is also a generalization
of previous results in [22, 24, 26].

Lemma 2.2. Let (M, g, e−f dv) be an n-dimensional complete smooth metric
measure space. For any point x0 ∈ M and R > 0, Ricf ≥ −(n − 1)K for
some constant K ≥ 0 in B(x0, R). Let 0 < u(x, t) ≤ D be a smooth solution

Proof. The proof of lemma is almost the same as that of [24]. In fact, in
Lemma 2.1 of [24], if we let α = 1 + ln D, which means α = µ, then we have
δ = 1. Therefore from (2.4) of [24], we immediately get (2.6).

In the rest of this section, we introduce a smooth cut-oﬀ function origi-
nated by Li-Yau [15] (see also [1] and [26]). This will also be used in the
proof of our theorems.

Lemma 2.3. Fix t0 ∈ R and T > 0. For any τ ∈ (t0 − T, t0], there exists a
smooth function ¯ψ : [0,∞) × [t0 − T, t0] → R such that:

We remind the readers that Lemma 2.3 is a little diﬀerent from that of [15]
and [22]. Here, the cut-oﬀ function was previously used by M. Bailesteanua,
X. Cao and A. Pulemotov [1].

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section, we will apply Lemmas 2.1 and 2.3, the localization tech-
nique of Souplet-Zhang [22], some tricks of Bailesteanua-Cao-Pulemotov [1],
Li [14], Brighton [3] and Jiang [12] to prove Theorem 1.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We only prove the case (i) a ≥ 0. The case (ii) a < 0
is similar. Pick any number τ ∈ (t0 − T, t0] and choose a cutoﬀ function
¯ψ(r, t) satisfying propositions of Lemma 2.3. We will show that (1.6) holds
at the space-time point (x, τ ) for all x such that d(x, x0) < R/2, where
R ≥ 2. Since τ is arbitrary, the conclusion then follows.

Introduce a cutoﬀ function ψ : M × [t0 − T, t0] → R, such that
Then, ψ(x, t) is supported in QR,T . Our aim is to estimate (cid:0)∆f − ∂

ψω attains its maximum.

Let (x1, t1) be a maximum space-time point for ψω in the closed set

{(x, t) ∈ M × [t0 − T, τ ]|d(x, x0) ≤ R} .

Assume that (ψω)(x1, t1) > 0; otherwise, ω(x, τ ) ≤ 0 and (1.6) naturally
holds at (x, τ ) whenever d(x, x0) < R
2 . Here t1 6= t0 − T , since we assume
(ψω)(x1, t1) > 0. We can also assume that function ψ(x, t) is smooth at

(x1, t1) due to the standard Calabi’s argument [4]. Since (x1, t1) is a maxi-
mum space-time point, at this point,

(ψω)t ≥ 0 and ∇(ψω) = 0.
Using these, (3.1) at space-time (x1, t1) can be simpliﬁed as

∆f (ψω) ≤ 0,

We apply (3.2) to prove the theorem. If x1 ∈ B(x0, 1), then ψ is constant
in space direction in B(x0, R/2) according to our assumption, where R ≥ 2.

ilar to the arguments of Souplet-Zhang [22]. Meanwhile, we also repeatedly

Furthermore, if a = 0 and f is constant, by using the classical Laplacian

in QR/2,T with t 6= t0 − T , for all R > 0. Compared with Hamilton’s
estimate [10] and Souplet-Zhang’s estimate [22] for the heat equation, this
elliptic gradient estimate seems to be new.

Moreover, gradient estimate (3.10) implies

Corollary 3.1. Let (M, g, e−f dv) be an n-dimensional complete smooth
metric measure space with Ricf ≥ −(n − 1)K for some constant K ≥ 0.
If u(x, t) is a positive ancient solution to the f -heat equation (1.2) such that
0 < u(x, t) ≤ D for some constant D, then |∇u| ≤ c(n)D√K.

Remark 3.2. Corollary 3.1 implies Brighton’s result [3]: any positive bounded
f -harmonic function on complete noncompact smooth metric measure spaces
with Ricf ≥ 0 must be constant.

In the rest of this section, we shall apply Theorem 1.1 to prove Theorem

1.3, Corollary 1.4 and Corollary 3.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. When a > 0, since K = 0 and D = e−2, then
c1(n, K, a, D) = 0. Fixing any space-time point (x0, t0) and using Theo-
rem 1.1 for 0 < u ≤ e−2 in the set B(x0, R) × (t0 − R2, t0], we have

R

+

R!

for all R ≥ 2. Letting R → ∞, then

|∇u(x0, t0)| = 0.

Since (x0, t0) is arbitrary, u must be constant in x. By equation (1.3), then

Solving this ODE, we get

du
dt

= a u ln u.

u = exp(ceat),

where c is some constant and a > 0. For such a solution, if we let t → −∞,
then

which is contradiction with the theorem assumption: 0 < u(x, t) ≤ e−2.
Therefore such u does not exist.

u = exp(ceat) → 1,

ELLIPTIC GRADIENT ESTIMATES FOR A NONLINEAR HEAT EQUATION

When a < 0, since K = 0 and δ = e−2, then c2(n, K, a, D) = 0. For any
space-time point (x0, t0), we apply Theorem 1.1 for e−2 ≤ u(x, t) ≤ D in
the set B(x0, R) × (t0 − R2, t0],

|∇u|√u

(x0, t0) ≤ c(n)√D r 1 + |α|

for all R ≥ 2. Similar to the above arguments, letting R → ∞, then u is
constant in x, and u = exp(ceat) for some constant c. When t → −∞, we
observe that: u = exp(ceat) → +∞ if c > 0; u = exp(ceat) → 0 if c < 0; u =
1 if c = 0. Moreover, the theorem assumption requires e−2 ≤ u(x, t) ≤ D.
Hence u only exists when D ≥ 1 and the desired result follows.
When a = 0, K = 0, and assume that u(x, t) is a positive ancient solution
to equation (1.2) such that u(x, t) = o(cid:16)(cid:2)r1/2(x) + |t|1/4(cid:3)2(cid:17) near inﬁnity.
Fixing any space-time (x0, t0) and using (3.10) for u on the set B(x0, R) ×
(t0 − R2, t0], we obtain

|∇u|√u

(x0, t0) ≤ c(n) r 1 + |α|
for all R ≥ 2. Letting R → ∞, it follows that
|∇u(x0, t0)| = 0.

Since (x0, t0) is arbitrary, we get u is constant in space-time.

Theorem 1.3 in fact implies Corollary 1.4.

Proof of Corollary 1.4. If positive smooth function u(x) achieves the weighted

log-Sobolev constant SM and satisﬁes RM u2e−f dv = Vf (M ), then from the
introduction above, u(x) satisﬁes elliptic equation (1.5). Assume that our
conclusion is incorrect, that is, 0 < u ≤ e−2. Since SM > 0, by Theorem
1.3 Case (i), there does not exist such function u satisfying (1.5). This is a
contradiction.

Proof of Corollary 3.1. When a = 0, for any space-time point (x0, t0), using

4. Proof of Theorem 1.5

In this section, we will prove Theorem 1.5. The proof is analogous to
Theorem 1.1 in [26]. For the readers convenience, we provide a detailed
proof. Compared with the previous proof, here we need to carefully deal
with an extra nonlinear term.

Proof of Theorem 1.5. We only consider the case a ≥ 0. The case a < 0 is
similar. Using Lemma 2.2, we calculate that

Let (x1, t1) be a point where ψω achieves the maximum.

We ﬁrst consider the case x1 6∈ B(x0, 1). By Li-Yau [15], without loss
of generality we assume that x1 is not in the cut-locus of M . Then at this
point, we have

∆f (ψω) ≤ 0,

(ψω)t ≥ 0, ∇(ψω) = 0.

Hence by (4.1), at (x1, t1), we get

2ψ(µ − g)ω2 ≤((cid:18) 2(g − ln D)

We will carefully estimate the upper bounds for each term of the right-hand

where α = max{x|d(x,x0)=1} ∆f r(x). For the fourth term of the right hand

Now we consider the other case: x1 ∈ B(x0, 1). In this case, ψ is constant
in space direction in B(x0, R/2) by our assumption, where R ≥ 2. So at
