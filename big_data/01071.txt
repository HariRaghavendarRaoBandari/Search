After a quench in a quantum many-body system, expectation values tend to relax towards long-
time averages. However, in any ﬁnite-size system, temporal ﬂuctuations remain. It is crucial to
study the suppression of these ﬂuctuations with system size. The particularly important case of non-
integrable models has been addressed so far only by numerics and conjectures based on analytical
bounds.
In this work, we are able to derive analytical predictions for the temporal ﬂuctuations
in a non-integrable model (the transverse Ising chain with extra terms). Our results are based on
identifying a dynamical regime of ’many-particle dephasing’, where quasiparticles do not yet relax
but ﬂuctuations are nonetheless suppressed exponentially by weak integrability breaking.

Introduction – The relaxation dynamics of quantum
many-body systems has come under renewed scrutiny in
the past years, due to its relevance for the foundations of
thermodynamics and the availability of isolated systems,
like cold atoms. The simplest case considers the evolu-
tion after a sudden quench of parameters [1]. Typically,
one then analyzes local physical observables (like par-
ticle density, magnetization, currents), and asks about
the time-evolution of expectation values. The most ba-
sic question concerns the long-time averages after the
quench: are they correctly described by a thermal state
at some eﬀective temperature related to the initial energy
after the quench? [2–17]. On the next, more reﬁned level
of analysis we can study the time-dependent ﬂuctuations
of expectation values around their temporal average. For
any ﬁnite system, these persist even at inﬁnite time. In
principle, these represent a kind of long-term memory,
since they are reproducible (the same for each repetition
of the quench) and depend both on the exact time of the
quench and on details of the initial state.

A crucial question for the foundations of statistical
physics is: are these ﬂuctuations suppressed in the ther-
modynamic limit N → ∞, and if yes, how fast? This is
also relevant for experiments in equilibration, like analog
quantum simulations carried out in ﬁnite (’mesoscopic’)
lattices.

These ﬂuctuations around the time-average are com-
A = [(cid:104) ˆA(t)(cid:105) − (cid:104) ˆA(cid:105)eq]2 [5, 18–20].
monly characterized by σ2
The overbar denotes a time-average and (cid:104) ˆA(cid:105)eq = (cid:104) ˆA(t)(cid:105).
Note that this is diﬀerent from the quantum ﬂuctuations
Var ˆA(t) = (cid:104)[ ˆA(t) − (cid:104) ˆA(t)(cid:105)]2(cid:105), which are usually much
larger and would be present even in a perfect thermal
equilibrium state (where σ2

A vanishes).

The ﬁnite-size scaling of persistent temporal ﬂuctua-
tions after a quench has been approached so far from sev-
eral angles: (i) in the context of the Eigenstate Thermal-
ization Hypothesis, justifying the neglect of oﬀ-diagonal
contributions to expectation values [21–24], (ii) based
on the former, general mathematical bounds supple-

mented by physical arguments for generic interacting,
non-integrable systems [18, 19, 25, 26]; (iii) calculations
for simple integrable systems (which have, however, spe-
cial properties that strongly diﬀer from the generic case)
[20, 27–30]; (iv) numerics [31].

Here, we will provide exact analytical results for the
suppression of ﬂuctuations in a non-integrable system,
conﬁrming the hypothesized exponential decay with sys-
tem size. Our analysis rests on identifying a general dy-
namical regime which we term ’many-particle dephasing’,
relevant for weak integrability breaking. The advantage
over having purely numerical results will be that we can
provide a complete description of how the result depends
on the quench, the initial state, and parameters. The
advantage vs. analytical bounds is that the bounds are
not guaranteed to be close to the true results.

Integrable transverse Ising Model – We start from the
well-known integrable quantum Ising chain. We review
brieﬂy its properties and its quench dynamics, as they
will be important for our analytical solution of the non-
integrable evolution later on. The quantum (transverse)
Ising chain is an exactly solvable model for quantum
phase transitions [32–37]:

Here ˆσx,j and ˆσz,j are spin-1/2 operators acting on site
j. We will assume periodic boundary conditions, with
ˆσx,N +1 = ˆσx,1. For J < Ω/2, the model is paramagnetic
(where (cid:104)ˆσz,j(cid:105) < 0), while at J = Ω/2 there is a quantum
phase transition into a ferromagnetic phase, with spins
aligning either in the +x or −x direction. The model
can be solved exactly by mapping to free fermions, via
l=1 ˆc†l ˆcl). This results in a quadratic
fermionic Hamiltonian that does not conserve particle
number and can be solved by Bogoliubov transformation

ˆσ+,j = ˆc†j exp(iπ(cid:80)j−1

(2)
For deﬁniteness we will assume N even. The quantization
of wavenumbers is slightly changed from the textbook
case (due to an extra sign that enters when coupling site
2 ), where l is an integer
N to site 1), with k = 2π
and k ranges over the Brillouin zone [−π, π[. The Hamil-
tonian decomposes into independent sectors (k,−k).
For this as well as other integrable models it has been
found that the temporal variance of many single-particle
observables scales like 1/N [20, 28]. However, there are
important exceptions where there is no such suppression
with N [16, 29].

N (l + 1

In a quench of the coupling strength J out of the pre-
quench ground state, during the evolution we will have
(k,−k) either occupied by two particles or unoccupied.
This can be viewed as an artiﬁcial spin 1/2 system. We
take ˆSzk = −1 to correspond to |0−k, 0k(cid:105) and ˆSzk = +1
representing |1−k, 1k(cid:105) = ˆS+
k |0−k, 0k(cid:105), with ˆS+
−k.
In that notation, the Hamiltonian (2) becomes a set of
(cid:88)
decoupled eﬀective spin-1/2 systems:

ground and excited state, |±k(cid:105), have energies ±Ωk/2,
= ±(cid:126)bk. In this picture, a quench cor-
and
(cid:69)
responds to a sudden change of Ωk and (cid:126)bk, such that for
each k the Bloch vector starts to precess around the new
ﬁeld direction: d

N−1(cid:80)

An example for an observable is the projector for the
spin pointing along +z at some site j: ˆA = ˆσ+,j ˆσ−,j.
Because of translational invariance, (cid:104) ˆA(t)(cid:105) is indepen-
k>0((cid:104) ˆSzk(cid:105) +
1),resulting in an expression of the form (cid:104) ˆA(t)(cid:105) =
k>0 (A0k + Ack cos(Ωkt) + Ask sin(Ωkt)). At suf-
ﬁciently long times, all the oscillatory terms dephase, pro-
ducing seemingly random time-dependent ﬂuctuations.
This process can be termed “single-particle dephasing”,
since it results from the superposition of diﬀerent oscil-
lation frequencies whose number scales linearly with sys-
tem size.

Quench in the non-integrable model – The general
physical expectation for non-integrable systems is that
the long-time steady state after a quench has ﬂuctua-
tions that are exponentially suppressed in particle num-
ber (system size) N, in contrast to the power-law sup-
pression in the integrable case displayed above. This
was made explicit ﬁrst in [18]. There, an upper bound
A ≤ (amax − amin)2 · IPR. Here, amax
was derived, σ2
and amin are the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of
n |(cid:104)Φn |Ψ(0)(cid:105)|4 denotes the inverse partic-
ipation ratio, which decreases if the initial state |Ψ(0)(cid:105)
spreads over more energy eigenstates |Φn(cid:105). It was then
argued on general physical grounds that the IPR usually
decreases exponentially with system size. However, an
argument of this kind does not reveal how fast the decay
is for any concrete system or quench scenario, or whether
the upper bound displays the correct parameter depen-
dence at all, since it will not be tight in general. More
recently, it was reported that numerical simulations for a
variety of models and quench scenarios indeed reveal an
exponential suppression with system size, for the ﬁnite-
size systems that could be addressed [31].

(cid:80)

Our goal here is to go beyond bounds and numerics,
and to ﬁnd an analytical expression for a non-integrable
case. We break the integrability of the quantum Ising
model by adding next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) coupling
j ˆσx,j ˆσx,j+2. In the fermion represen-
ˆHNNN = −JNNN
tation, this gives rise to two-particle interactions. Other
choices for integrability breaking are possible, which
we will address later. A direct numerical simulation
(Fig. (1)) indeed reveals a stronger suppression of ﬂuctu-
ations, that seems to be consistent with an exponential
decay in N.

We now come to an important question: What is the
physical origin of this strong suppression? Initially, one
might suspect ’true thermalization’, in the sense of in-
elastic scattering of quasiparticles leading to a redistri-
bution of quasiparticle populations. This process could
then be described using a kinetic equation, and the ﬁnal

gle quasiparticle at a time, or (in our case) it aﬀects only
a single (k,−k) pair of states. All other quasiparticles
(or k-pairs) are merely spectators. Such a structure is
typical for single-particle observables. It is at this point
that the weak integrability-breaking interactions impose
a crucial diﬀerence. For the integrable (eﬀectively non-
interacting) case, there is an exponentially large number
of other transitions that have the same transition energy.
These are obtained by picking all possible conﬁgurations
of the remaining ’spectator’ degrees of freedom (which
are identical in the initial and ﬁnal state). In contrast,
for the non-integrable (weakly interacting) case, there
is a correction to the transition energies which lifts this
massive degeneracy. For the present model, the transi-
tion energy correction δ∆f i ∼ JNNN turns out to be a
sum over contributions that depend on pairs of occupa-
tion numbers, nk and nk(cid:48) (see Suppl. Material). Given a
change in one of the occupation numbers, the correction
thus depends on the conﬁguration of all the ’spectator’
degrees of freedom. Therefore, barring any (rare) acci-
dental degeneracies, the initial degeneracy is completely
lifted. That statement is conﬁrmed by direct numerical
inspection of δ∆f i.

Assuming that all the transition energies ∆α have be-
.
come non-degenerate, we ﬁnd σ2
In general, it would still be an impossible task to evalu-
ate this expression analytically. At this stage, however,
the important observation is that the ∆α do not enter any
more, even though their modiﬁcation by the weak inter-
action was crucial to lift the degeneracies. Our strategy
will be to evaluate this expression for the matrix ele-
ments calculated with respect to the unperturbed inte-
grable many-particle eigenfunctions. In this way, we will
arrive at analytical insights into the suppression of ﬂuctu-
ations for the non-integrable model! The requirement for
this to work is that the perturbation JNNN is still weak,
such that the eigenfunctions have not been changed ap-
preciably. Later we will check the results against numer-
ics.

that this is not the case, the quasiparticle distribution re-
mains practically unchanged. There is further numerical
evidence that we are not witnessing thermalization: The
ﬂuctuations decay to their steady-state long-time limit
during a time-scale τ∗ that scales linearly in the inverse
perturbation: τ∗ ∼ |JNNN|−1. This is in contrast to the
behaviour expected from a kinetic equation, where the
relaxation rate would be set by J 2

Many-particle dephasing – Instead, we have identiﬁed a
mechanism that could be termed ’many-particle dephas-
ing’. First, we note that, for weak interactions, the many-
body energy eigenstates still coincide to a very good ap-
proximation with those of the integrable model. This ex-
plains the absence of thermalization in the occupations of
quasiparticles. At the same time, however, the energies
are changed. This lifts the exponentially large degenera-
cies of the integrable model and gives rise to dephasing.
The number of frequencies involved is now exponentially
large in N, which is the reason we term the resulting dy-
namics “many-particle dephasing”. The generic situation,
including the diﬀerent timescales, is shown schematically
in Fig. 2. We note that interacting systems mappable to
noninteracting ones (the present case) and purely non-
interacting systems have to be distinguished. Only in the
former the complete one-particle density matrix relaxes
[16].

conﬁgurations ϕ(i, k(cid:48)) and ϕ(f, k(cid:48)) to be equal except at
k(cid:48) = k. We still have to sum over exponentially many
conﬁgurations, though that can be handled by regroup-
ing terms and a bit of combinatorics (see Suppl. Mate-
rial). In doing this, we exploit the fact that the initial
state can be written as a product state over the diﬀer-
ent k-sectors (since it is an eigenstate of the pre-quench
Hamiltonian).

Analytical results – The ﬁnal analytical result for the

observed) suppression of ﬂuctuations, exponential in sys-
tem size, can be studied analytically in detail.

Other integrability-breaking interactions can be ana-
lyzed along the same lines. For example, consider a
j=1 σx,j. Due to the
weak longitudinal ﬁeld ˆVx = Jx
ˆσx (cid:55)→ −ˆσx symmetry of the unperturbed system, the
ﬁrst order energy corrections vanish in the paramagnetic
phase. Higher order contributions can still lead to inte-
grability breaking. In the paramagnetic phase, this yields
a good agreement with our analytical prediction (4). In
the ferromagnetic phase, ˆVx breaks the inversion sym-
metry. Thus the change in the eigenstates is large and
the deviations become signiﬁcant (Fig. 4). Still, if we
decrease the perturbation to suﬃciently small values (or-
ange crosses) we once again get a good agreement with
the analytical prediction (see also Suppl. Mat.).

quench dynamics of ﬁnite-size (“mesoscopic”) weakly non-
integrable many-particle systems, where the ﬂuctuations
are suppressed exponentially in system-size, in contrast
to the integrable case. We have presented a strategy to
obtain analytical results for the steady-state long-time
limit.

We expect that the basic mechanism discussed here
should apply whenever one starts from an eﬀectively non-
interacting model (where the many-particle energy can
be written as a sum over independent contributions) and
introduces a perturbation that lifts the resulting massive
degeneracies. For ﬁnite systems, the perturbation can be
weak enough that its eﬀect on the energies is the main
eﬀect, while the many-particle energy eigenstates are still
those of the unperturbed system: even an inﬁnitesimal
interaction is suﬃcient to lift the degeneracies and will
thus lead to a completely diﬀerent behaviour of the ﬂuc-
tuations in the long-time limit (although the time-scale
for reaching this limit will of course diverge as the inter-
action tends to zero!).

The sum over λ corresponds to the diﬀerent terms present
in the fermionic representation of ˆVNNN and for each k(cid:48)
there is a correction that depends on the respective oc-
cupation numbers. This is very similar to Hartree-Fock
corrections for the interacting Fermi gas. For our pur-
poses, the precise form of F and W is not important,
although it can be written down explicitly. The result-
ing splitting of a single degenerate transition energy is
plotted in ﬁgure 5.

possible initial conﬁgurations {ϕk(cid:48) = ±k(cid:48)}. Because of
the Kronecker deltas the ﬁnal conﬁgurations diﬀer only
in the single k-sector from the ﬁrst sum, resulting in −ϕk.
Next comes the crucial part, exchanging the sum of
all conﬁgurations with the product of all positive wave
numbers. The result is the product of all wave numbers
k(cid:48), with each factor containing the sum of the conﬁgura-
tions in the (k(cid:48),−k(cid:48))-section. Taking special care of the
k-sector, we obtain

In order to understand this, recall that Ik causes all
initial and ﬁnal spectators to match expect for the wave
number k. Hence IkIk(cid:48) can be nonzero only if either the
wave numbers are the same or if k (cid:54)= k(cid:48) and m = n.
The latter drops out because only diﬀerent conﬁguration
contribute to the temporal ﬂuctuations.

deltas in Ik, we obtain

III. SYMMETRY BREAKING DUE TO A

LONGITUDINAL MAGNETIC FIELD

In the main text, we show results for a longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld as a weak perturbation. We found good
agreement in the paramagnetic phase, but deviations in
the ferromagnetic phase. These deviations occur be-
cause the longitudinal ﬁeld breaks the inversion symme-
try. Here we discuss why we still ﬁnd a good agreement
for suﬃciently weak perturbations.

Starting in the ferromagnetic phase and the thermo-
dynamic limit, there are two degenerate ground states
[38]. One with all spins pointing along +x, and one with
all spins along −x. Once the system size N becomes ﬁ-
nite, both states can be connected by N spin ﬂips. The
transverse ﬁeld Ωσz thus leads to an exponentially small
energy gap that scales as (Ω/J)N. This gap separates the
two new lowest-lying eigenstates, which are the symmet-
ric and antisymmetric superposition of the two polarized
states. These correspond to the even and odd total par-
ticle number states in the fermionic picture.

In our analytics we assumed the system to be in the
even subspace. A longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, stronger
than the energy gap caused by the transverse ﬁeld, mixes
the symmetric and anti-symmetric subspaces. Thus the
eigenstates diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the unperturbed case.
This leads to deviation that could be corrected in prin-
ciple, by using the correct eigenstates in the analytics.
However, if the perturbation is suﬃciently small the even
and odd subspaces will stay well separated and the ana-
lytical results derived in the main text stay valid.
