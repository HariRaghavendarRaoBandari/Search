Abstract

In this paper, the Lie group Gα,β,γ

NC , of which the kinematical symmetry group
GNC of noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM) is a special case due to ﬁxed
nonzero α, β and γ, is three-parameter deformation quantized using the method
suggested by Ballesteros and Musso in [1]. A certain family of QUE algebras, cor-
responding to Gα,β,γ
NC with two of the deformation parameters approaching zero, is
found to be in agreement with the existing results of the literature on quantum
Heisenberg group. Finally, we dualize the underlying QUE algebra to obtain an
expression for the underlying ∗-product between smooth functions on Gα,β,γ
NC .

Introduction

Noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM) is a vibrant ﬁeld of research these days.
In addition to the canonical position-momentum noncommutativity, it also demands for
the noncommutativity between the two position coordinates and the two momenta co-
ordinates respectively for a system of two degrees of freedom. The noncommutativity
of the position coordinates was ﬁrst proposed by H. S. Snyder [13] in his quest for the
quantized nature of space-time. Such a model of space-time in scales as small as Planck
length is also proposed, among others by Doplicher et al. [11] in order to avoid creation
of microscopic black holes to the eﬀect of losing the operational meaning of localization
in space-time. The noncommutativity of the momenta coordinates, on the other hand,
emerges if one introduces a constant background magnetic ﬁeld to the underlying system
of two degrees of freedom.

The deﬁning group of a two-dimensional quantum mechanical system is the well-
known Heisenberg group (denoted by GH in the sequel). What runs parallel to GH in
two dimensions, is the triply extended group of translations of R4 (denoted as GNC in the

sequel) in the context of NCQM. This nilpotent Lie group was ﬁrst introduced in [7] and
was later studied extensively in terms of its unitary dual in [8]. It was also shown in [8]
that the unitary dual of GH sits inside that of GNC pointing up the universal nature of GNC
as the underlying group of quantum mechanics. This Lie group was later identiﬁed as the
kinematical symmetry group for this model of NCQM in [9] by computing its associated
Wigner functions which under appropriate limit agrees with the quantum mechanical
Wigner function originally computed by Wigner in his seminal paper [14].

The well-established theory of deformation quantization insinuates the fact that the
structure of a Lie group is not quite a rigid one. Here one equips the enveloping algebra
of the underlying Lie algebra with some additional structures in a compatible way to
make it a Hopf algebra which is noncommutative (inherited from the Lie algebra struc-
ture) but co-commutative. For details on the Hopf algebraic terminologies, we refer the
readers to the classic reading [6]. The goal of deformation quantization is to deform the
coalgebra structure of the universal enveloping algebra considered as a Hopf algebra. The
resulting deformed object known as quantized universal enveloping algebra (abbreviated
as QUE algebra) still lies in the category of Hopf algebra. “Quantum Group” is a widely
used misnomer in modern mathematical literature for QUE algebra resulting from the
deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of some Lie algebra.

Quantum Heisenberg group in one and higher dimensions have been studied thor-
oughly in the past (see, for example, [5, 4, 12]). Deformation quantization of NCQM, on
the other hand, had been studied recently by Bastos et al.
in a series of papers by fo-
cussing on the computation of various ∗-products between functions lying in S(R2n) (see,
for example, [2, 3, 10]). Here in this paper, following a method prescribed by Ballesteros
et al. (see [1]), we take a diﬀerent route to ﬁnd a three-parameter deformation of the
α,β,γ
universal enveloping algebra associated with a family of Lie algebras denoted by g
NC
of which gNC (Lie algebra of GNC) is a special case (see below with ﬁxed nonzero α, β
and γ). We verify that under classical limits of two of the deformation parameters, one
due to β = γ = 0 essentially reproduces the Hopf algebra structure
of the families g
associated with the Heisenberg group found by Celeghini et al.
in [5]. We also ﬁnd
the ∗-products between smooth functions on Gα,β,γ
(Lie group corresponding to the Lie
α,β,γ
NC ) by dualising the underlying QUE algebra and discuss the linear Poisson
algebra g
structures arising in the classical limit, i.e. when the deformation parameters approach
zero. We verify that such linear Poisson structure indeed agrees with the underlying Lie
bialgebra structure.

The organisation of the paper is as follows. In section II, following a brief description
of the Lie group Gα,β,γ
to be studied, we ﬁnd the QUE algebra associated with the
underlying enveloping algebra and study various limiting cases to compare our results
against the existing ones for the Heisenberg case. We also, compute the cocommutators
associated with the generators from the explicit expressions of the coproducts of the

NC

underlying QUE algebra to ﬁnd the corresponding bialgebra structure. In section III,
we compute the ∗-products between smooth functions on GNC by considering the dual
QUE algebra and see how they give rise to linear Poisson structure that is in complete
agreement with the bialgebra structure computed in section II. Finally, in section IV, we
give our concluding remarks and point to some possible future work.

Let us ﬁrst have a cursory look at the algebraic structure associated with the group
Gα,β,γ
be a Lie group whose generic element
is denoted by (θ, φ, ψ, q, p), where q, p ∈ R2. Then the group composition law for Gα,β,γ
reads (cf. [8])

If q = (q1, q2), p = (p1, p2), then h, i and ∧ are deﬁned as hq, pi = q1p1 + q2p2 and
q ∧ p = q1p2 − q2p1 respectively.

Note that if we denote the dimension of the position coordinate by [q] and that of the
momentum coordinate by [p], then we immediately see that in order to have θ, φ and ψ
to be all dimensionless, we must have

[α] = [

[β] = [

[γ] = [

Let us denote the Lie algebra of Gα,β,γ
α,β,γ
NC . Since we are only intersted in the
α 6= 0 case, we may assume α 6= 0 throughout this paper. Under this assumption, we
α,β,γ
can choose an appropriate basis of g
NC , namely, {Θ, Φ, Ψ, Q1, Q2, P1, P2}, such that the
commutation relations between them have the following dimension-consistent form:

(i, j = 1, 2),

where δii = 1 and δij = 0 for i 6= j is the Kronecker symbol.

Using the method suggested by A. Ballesteros and F. Musso [1], we obtain a three-
α,β,γ
parameter deformation of the universal enveloping algebra U (g
NC ), as stated in the
next proposition. Note that our deformation is in the sense of “formal deformation of
Hopf algebras”, as is commonly adopted in the literature of “Quantum Groups”. We refer
the reader to the monograph [6] for a thorough introduction.

Throughout the paper we denote by C the set of complex numbers, and denote by
C[[1, 2, 3]] the commutative ring of formal power series in 1, 2 and 3 with complex

3

coeﬃcients. Then any associative algebra U over C[[1, 2, 3]] can be equipped with the
α,β,γ
(1, 2, 3)-adic topology (see, e.g. [6]). Henceforth we may consider U (g
NC ) as a Hopf
algebra over C.

Proposition II.1. Let U1,2,3(g

(i, j = 1, 2).

Then U1,2,3(g

and antipode deﬁned by

S(Θ) = −Θ, S(Φ) = −Φ, S(Ψ) = −Ψ, S(Qi) = −Qi, S(Pi) = −Pi,

(i = 1, 2).

Moreover, U1,2,3(g

α,β,γ
NC ) is a three-parameter quantization of g

α,β,γ
NC .

Proof. (∆ is a well-deﬁned algebra homomorphism) Note that ρ, λ are central
elements, we have [Q1 ⊗ eρ, e−ρ ⊗ P1] = 0 and

[Q1 ⊗ eρ, P1 ⊗ eρ] = Q1P1 ⊗ e2ρ − P1Q1 ⊗ e2ρ = [Q1, P1] ⊗ e2ρ =

λ
α

Θ ⊗ e2ρ.

From this we get

[∆(Q1), ∆(P1)] = [Q1 ⊗ eρ + e−ρ ⊗ Q1, P1 ⊗ eρ + e−ρ ⊗ P1]

=

1
α

(λΘ ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ λΘ) = ∆(

λ
α

Θ) = ∆([Q1, P1]).

Similarly, we can prove that [∆(Q2), ∆(P2)] = ∆([Q2, P2]), [∆(Q1), ∆(Q2)] = ∆([Q1, Q2])
and [∆(P1), ∆(P2)] = ∆([P1, P2]). Furthermore, since ∆(Θ) is a central element, we have

[∆(Θ), ∆(Φ)] = ∆([Θ, Φ]) = [∆(Θ), ∆(P1)] = ∆([Θ, P1]) = 0.

4

We also get

[∆(P1), ∆(Q2)] = [P1 ⊗ eρ + e−ρ ⊗ P1, Q2 ⊗ eρ + e−ρ ⊗ Q2] = 0 = ∆([P1, Q2]).

Thus all typical deﬁning relations of algebra are checked to be preserved by ∆, hence the
other deﬁning relations are also preserved. We also have to check the consistency of the
deﬁnitions of ∆(Θ), ∆(Φ), ∆(Ψ) and ∆(ρ). Indeed,

∆(1Θ + 2Φ + 3Ψ) =

ρλ ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ ρλ

∆(λ)

=

(e2ρ − e−2ρ) ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ (e2ρ − e−2ρ)

∆(4λ)

= ∆(ρ).

Thus ∆ is actually a well-deﬁned algebra homomorphsim.

(∆ is coassociative) Note that ∆(λ) = e2ρ⊗e2ρ−e−2ρ⊗e−2ρ

4∆(ρ)

, we have

(1 ⊗ ∆)∆(λ) =

e2ρ ⊗ e2ρ ⊗ e2ρ − e−2ρ ⊗ e−2ρ ⊗ e−2ρ
4(ρ ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ρ ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ ρ)

= (∆ ⊗ 1)∆(λ).

Therefore, to prove (1 ⊗ ∆)∆(Θ) = (∆ ⊗ 1)∆(Θ), we only need to check

(1 ⊗ ∆)(λΘ ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ λΘ) = (∆ ⊗ 1)(λΘ ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ λΘ).

The two sides of the above equality are all easily seen to be

λΘ ⊗ e2ρ ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ λΘ ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ ⊗e−2ρ ⊗ λΘ.

This veriﬁes the coassociativity of ∆ on Θ. The coassociativity of ∆ on the other gener-
ators can be veriﬁed similarly.

(ǫ is a well-deﬁned algebra homomorphism) This is obvious.
(ǫ is truely a counit) By simple computation, we see (1 ⊗ ǫ)∆(Θ) = λΘ

λ = Θ. Such

relation for the other generators are veriﬁed by similar computation.

(S is a well-deﬁned algebra anti-homomorphism) Note that S(ρ) = −ρ and

S(eρ) = e−ρ, we have S(λ) = λ. Let us check that

[S(Q1), S(P1)] = [−Q1, −P1] =

λ
α

Θ = S([P1, Q1]).

The other deﬁning relations are checked similarly.

(The structure maps are compatible) We want to prove that for each generator
X ∈ {Θ, Φ, Ψ, Q1, Q2, P1, P2}, we get µ(S ⊗ 1)∆(X) = µ(1 ⊗ S)∆(X) = ǫ(X) = 0, where
µ is the multiplication map from the algebra structure. Due to the similarity between
generators, the invertibility of λ, and the “almost symmetric” nature of ∆, we only prove
the equalities µ(S ⊗ 1)∆(λΘ) = µ(S ⊗ 1)∆(P1) = 0. In fact,

µ(S ⊗ 1)∆(λΘ) = µ(S ⊗ 1)(λΘ ⊗ e2ρ + e−2ρ ⊗ λΘ) = −λΘe2ρ + e2ρλΘ = 0,

µ(S ⊗ 1)∆(P1) = µ(S ⊗ 1)(P1 ⊗ eρ + e−ρ ⊗ P1) = −P1eρ + eρP1 = 0.

This proves the compatibility of structure maps.

This is a quantization of Hisenberg algebra deﬁned by E. Celeghini, et al. (see [5]).

Also note that in the Heisenberg algebra case, there exist coboundary but non-quasi-
triangular Lie bialgebra structures; and if we would like to extend the Heisenberg algebra
by a derivation, then there is a quasitriangular Lie bialgebra structure, and the above
quantization provids an universal R-matrix, which can be obtained by a contraction on an
R-matrix of the Drinfeld-Jimbo type quantum group (see [5]).

However, when α, β, γ 6= 0, we checked by the mathematical software Mathematica

And in U0,0,3(g

This implies that the cocommutator δ of g

satiﬁes

δ(Θ) = 2Θ ∧ (aΘ + bΦ + cΨ)

for some ﬁxed a, b, c ∈ C. By a similar computation, we get

δ(Φ) = 2Φ ∧ (aΘ + bΦ + cΨ),

δ(Ψ) = 2Ψ ∧ (aΘ + bΦ + cΨ),

δ(Qi) = Qi ∧ (aΘ + bΦ + cΨ),

δ(Pi) = Pi ∧ (aΘ + bΦ + cΨ),

(i = 1, 2).

Clearly this is not a coboundary Lie bialgebra structure when a, b, c are not all zero, since
Θ, Φ and Ψ are central elements.

As a formal power series in 1, 2 and 3, the constant term of W IY J ∗ W KY L is clearly
W I+KY J+L, thus the classical limit of the ∗-product is indeed commutative. Moreover,
the linear term of W IY J ∗ W KY L is

a [k1(2|I| + |J|) − i1(2|K| + |L|)] W I+K−(1,0,0)Y J+L
+ b [k2(2|I| + |J|) − i2(2|K| + |L|)] W I+K−(0,1,0)Y J+L
+ c [k3(2|I| + |J|) − i3(2|K| + |L|)] W I+K−(0,0,1)Y J+L

for some ﬁxed a, b, c ∈ C. In particular, if we denote

W (1,0,0) = χ1,

W (0,1,0) = χ2,

W (0,0,1) = χ3,

Y (1,0,0,0) = χ4,

Y (0,1,0,0) = χ5,

Y (0,0,1,0) = χ6,

Y (0,0,0,1) = χ7,

then we get

{χ1, χ2} = 2(bχ1 − aχ2),

{χ1, χ3} = 2(cχ1 − aχ3),

{χ2, χ3} = 2(cχ2 − bχ3),

{χi, χ1} = aχi,

{χi, χ2} = bχi,

{χi, χ3} = cχi,

{χi, χj} = 0,

(4 ≤ i, j ≤ 7).

IV Conclusion

In this paper we studied the deformation of noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM)
in two dimensions by quantizing its kinematical symmetry group GNC employing tech-
niques of quantum groups. We want to re-emphasize in this context that the authors in
[10] outlined a deformation quantization scheme by introducing new ∗-products between
elements of the Schwartz space of test functions and its dual on R2n.

To this end, they suitably deformed the standard symplectic matrix J to obtain the
skew-symmetric matrix Ω which approaches J as  → 0. In [9], on the other hand, a
three-parameter family of ∗-products, between Wigner functions of GNC supported on its
various coadjoint orbits, was introduced in terms of which properties of noncommutative
marginal distributions in position and momentum coordinates as obtained in [3] were
also veriﬁed to hold. The ∗-products and the relevant Poisson structures that we have
obtained in this paper are drastically of diﬀerent nature as they are the deformed products
for the algebra of functions on GNC, or more generally on Gα,β,γ
NC .

Also it is important to note that not all of the algebras in the family g

are non-
isomorphic. We have partial results on this classiﬁcation problem which we propose to
study in greater depth in a future publication.
