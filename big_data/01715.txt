Abstract

We study arbitrary order symmetry operators for the linear Schr¨odinger equations
with arbitrary number of spatial variables. We deduce determining equations for coeﬃ-
cient functions of such operators and consider in detail some cases when these equations
can be explicitly solved. In addition, the complete group classiﬁcation of the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation is presented.

Introduction

Higher order symmetry operators present powerful tools for investigations of partial diﬀerential
equations. They can be used to construct constants of motion for evolution equations, to
search for coordinate systems in which solutions with separated variables exist, and also for
investigations of superintegrable systems whose existence was predicted by Arnold Sommerfeld
in 1923 [1] while the systematical inquiry into the superintegrability problem was started by P.
Winternitz and co-authors [2].

We remind that a nice kind of symmetries called supersymmetry is also connected with

existence of higher order symmetry operators.

Investigations of symmetries of the Schr¨odinger equation (SE) started with papers of Niederer
and Boyer [3] who presented group classiﬁcation of linear SEs with potential terms. Such classi-
ﬁcation is connected with description of ﬁrst order symmetry operators for the related equation.
In fundamental paper [4] the complete description of second order symmetry operators for
the 1+2 dimensional SE was presented. Applications of these operators to the separation of
variables are discussed in the Miller book [5].

The problem of description of arbitrary order symmetry operators for the Schrodinger equa-
tion was formulated in papers [6] and [7].
In paper [8] the complete set of such operators
was found for the case of trivial potential. In [9] the third order symmetry operators for 1+1
dimensional SE with arbitrary potential were described and used to construct exact solutions.
Moreover, a rather nontrivial connections between the existence of the third order symmetry
operators for the linear SE and exact solutions of the related nonlinear equation was established
in [9].

The very existence of many of exact solutions for the nonlinear SE can be understood
starting with its symmetries with respect to continuous groups of transformations. The group
analysis of the nonlinear SE was carried out by a number of investigators, refer, e.g., to [11] and
references cited therein. However, in fact the related results were valid for ad hoc restricted
classes of the nonlinear SEs. The completed group classiﬁcation of this equation was presented
in the recent paper [12], the related problem for systems of reaction-diﬀusion equations was
solved in [13].

In the present paper we deduce the determining equations for coeﬃcients of arbitrary order
symmetry operators for the 1 + m dimensional SE with arbitrary number m of spatial variables.
We consider some cases when this system can be completely solved, and discuss the related
symmetry operators and their possible applications. In addition, we present the complete group
classiﬁcation of the nonlinear SE.

2 Symmetry operators of arbitrary order

2.1 Determining equations

Consider the SE with an arbitrary number m of spatial variables

LΨ(t, x) ≡(cid:18)i

∂
∂t −

p2

2M − V (x)(cid:19) Ψ(t, x) = 0.

(1)

Here – p2 = ∆m is the Laplace operator in space of m variables, X = (x1, x2, . . . xm), Ψ(t, x) is
a complex wave function.

1

For simplicity we restrict ourselves to such solutions of (1) which are deﬁned on an open set
D of the m + 1-dimensional manifold R consisting of points with coordinates (t, x1, x2, . . . , xm)
and are analytic in variables t, x1, . . . , xm. The set of such solutions forms a complex vector
space F0. Fixing D (e.q., supposing that D coincides with R) we come to space F0 of solutions
of the SE.

Let us denote by F the vector space of complex valued functions deﬁned and real-analytic
on D and by L the linear operator (1) deﬁned on F . Then L ∈ Ψ is Ψ ∈ F and F0 is the
subspace of F which coincides with the zero-space of L.

Let Q be a n-order diﬀerential operator deﬁned on L:

˜Qj = ha1,a2,...,aj

∂j

∂xa1∂xa2 . . . ∂xaj

.

(2)

Here and in the following the summation over the repeating indices is imposed over the values
1, 2, ..., m.

We say Q is a symmetry operators for SE (1) provided

[L, Q] = αQL

where [ , ] denotes commutator and αQ is a diﬀerential operator of order n − 1.

It is convenient to represent Q as a sum of j-multiple anticommutators [9]

where K a1a2...aj are symmetric tensors depending on t and x andhK∗,

K∗.
Commuting (4) with the Laplace operator we automatically come to a sum of j + 1 multiple
anticommutators, and it is the reason why just this representation of Q leads to the most simple
system of determining equations.

It is possible ad hoc set in (3) αQ = 0 in as much as the term ∂

∂t cannot appear in the
l.h.s. of this equation. Substituting (4) into (3) and equating the coeﬃcients for all powers of
diﬀerential operators we come to the following system of determining equations

and the complete symmetrization is imposed over the indices in brackets.

By deﬁnition, the terms with negative values of index numbers are identically zeros, while
if k = l,

the index with number zero is forbidden. For example, it is the case for W a1a2...a2l+1
i.e., W a1a2...a2k+1

k

k

= 0, (see (6)), and ˙K a1a2...a2s = ˙K if s = 0.

The system (5) describes the coeﬃcients of n-order symmetry operator for non-stationary
Schr¨odinger equations. However, it is valid also for the stationary equations provided functions
K a1a2...aj ,
j = 1, 2, ..., n are time independent. It is interesting to note that in this case the
system (5) is decoupled to two independent subsystems one of which includes tensors K a1a2...aj
with odd number of indices while the other is deﬁned for even j. Thus the n-order integral of
motion can be represented as a sum of two independent operators (4) of orders n and n − 1.
The ﬁrst of them includes terms with j = n, n − 2, n − 4, ... while for the second one we have
expression (4) with j = n − 1, n − 3, n − 5, ....
We see that integrals of motions with even and odd d are linearly independent and can be
considered separately. For even n the determining equations (5) are reduced to the following
form:

∂(an+1K a1a2...an) = 0, n = 2r,

∂(a2l+1K a1a2...a2l) + M

l = 0, 1, 2, ..., r − 1
while for n odd we have:

(8)

Let us stress that formulae (7) and (8) together with deﬁnitions (6) present explicitly the
determining equations for potentials and the related coeﬃcients of integrals of motion of arbi-
trary order n and for arbitrary number m of spatial variables. We believe that the direct use
of these equations could be convenient in studies of higher (and even arbitrary) order integrals
of motion for quantum mechanical systems, which are rather popular now, see survey [14] and
paper [15].
Indeed, the derivation of the determining equations for higher order symmetry
operators with ﬁxed n and m looks as unnecessary waste of time and energy since this job has
been already done.

2.2 Complete set of symmetry operators of arbitrary order

For the case of ad hoc ﬁxed potential V (t, x) we can try to ﬁnd exact solutions of (5) for
arbitrary n.

If V (x) = 0 than the system of equations (5) is signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed and reduced to the

following form

∂(aj+1 K a1a2...aj) = −2M ˙K a1a2...aj+1,
∂(an+1 K a1a2...an) = 0,
˙K = 0,

j = 0.

j = 0, 1, ...n − 1,

3

(9)

Equations (9) can be solved explicitly for arbitrary n. A diﬀerential consequence of (9) is

∂(aj+1 ∂aj+2...∂aj+sK a1a2...aj) = 0,

s = n − j + 1.

(10)

Solutions of (10) are the generalized Killing tensors of order s and rank j whose explicit
form is presented in [10]. The ﬁrst of relations (9) reduces to the ﬁrst order ordinary equations
for arbitrary parameters deﬁning the generalized Killing tensors which are easily integrated.
The number Nn of linearly independent n-order symmetries is given by the following formula

Nn = 1

4! (n + 1)(n + 2)3(n + 3)

and all these symmetries belong to the enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of the Schr¨odinger
group [8].

2.3 Third order symmetry operators for 1 + 1-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation

One more simpliﬁed version of the determining equations (5) corresponds to a non-trivial po-
tential in the important case of the only spatial variable. Then the ﬁrst and second order
symmetry operators reduce on the set of solutions of the related SE to generators of a Lie
group.

Let us consider the case n = 3, which corresponds to the simplest non-Lie symmetry, in
2 . The related tensors K a1a2...aj in (4)

more detail. For simplicity we set m = 1 and V = U
reduce to scalars and so

Q =(cid:20)h(cid:2)h3, ∂

∂xi+
∂x(cid:3)+ , ∂

, ∂

∂x(cid:21)+h(cid:2)h2, ∂

∂xi+
∂x(cid:3)+ , ∂

The corresponding system (5) reduces to

+(cid:2)h1, ∂

∂x(cid:3)+ + h0.

h′2 + 2 ˙h3 = 0,

h′3 = 0,
2 ˙h2 + h′1 − 6h3U′ = 0,
2 ˙h1 + h′0 − 4h2U′ = 0,
˙h0 − h1U′ + h3U′′′ = 0,

where the dots and primes denote derivatives w.r.t. t and x respectively.

Excluding h0 from (13) and using (12) we arrive at the following equation

aU′′′′ − (2¨ax2 + 6aU + c − 2˙bx)U′′−
−6(2¨ax + aU′ − ˙b)U′ − 12¨aU − 2(2∂4

t ax2 − 2

...
b x + ¨c) = 0

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

where a, b, c are arbitrary functions of t. Equation (14) is nothing but the compatibility condi-
tion for system (12), (13). If the potential U satisﬁes (14) then the corresponding coeﬃcients
of the SO have the form

h3 = a,
h0 = − 4

3

...

h2 = −2 ˙ax + b,
a x3 + 2¨bx2 − 2 ˙cx − 4 ˙aϕ + 4(b − 2 ˙ax)U + d

h1 = g1 + 6aU,

4

(15)

where

Separating variables in (14) we conclude that up to equivalence, this equation can be reduced

g1 = 2¨ax2 − 2˙bx + c, ϕ =R Udx,

u = ϕ′,

d = d(t).

to one of the following forms:

U′′ − 3U 2 + 3ω1 = 0,

U′′ − 3U 2 − 8ω2x = 0,

(U′′ − 3U 2)′ − 2ω3(xU′ + 2U) = 0,

ϕ′′′ − 3(ϕ′)2 − 2ω4(x2ϕ)′ = 1

3ω2

4x4 + ω5 , U = ϕ′

where ω1, . . . ω5 are arbitrary constants.

From (11), (16)-(19) we ﬁnd the corresponding symmetry operators

Q = p3 + 3

4{U, p} ≡ 2pH + 1

where U are solutions of (16)-(19) and H = 1

Thus, the Schr¨odinger equation (2.1) admits a third-order SO if potential U satisﬁes one of

the equations (16)- (19). The explicit form of the corresponding SOs is present in (20)-(23).

Formula (16) presents the Weierstrass equation while relation (17) deﬁnes the ﬁrst Painlev´e
transcendent. Using generalized Miura ansatz equations (18) and (19) can be reduced to the
second and forth Painlev´e transcendents respectively or to special Riccatti equations [9].

Operators (20)-(23) together with Hamiltonian H form rather interesting algebras whose

analysis lies out of frames of the present paper.

3 Group classiﬁcation of the nonlinear SE

It was shown in [9] that if the linear one dimensional SE (1) admits the third order symmetry
operator (19) than there exists a wide class of solutions for (19) which solve also the nonlinear
SE with cubic nonlinearity. Thus there exist rather non-trivial connections between the third
order symmetries for the linear SE and symmetries of the nonlinear SE which cause the existence
of exact solutions.

equation

(24)

where Ψ = Ψ(t, x), x ∈ Rm, F is an arbitrary function of two variables: Ψ and complex
conjugated function Ψ∗.
Classical Lie symmetries of some special classes of equations (24) were investigated in nu-
merous papers, refer, e.g., to [11] and references cited therein. Here we present the results of
complete group classiﬁcation for all nonequivalent nonlinearities F , based on results of papers
[12] and [13].

To describe symmetries of the SE with non-ﬁxed nonlinearity in the l.h.s. we can use either
the classical Lie algorithm or its speciﬁc simpliﬁed version [13] which presupposes solution of
the following operator equation (compare with (1))

[L, Q] = αQL + ϕ(t, x)

where Q is a ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator, ϕ is unknown function. We will not present here
details of calculations but present the ﬁnal result of group classiﬁcation of (24).

For arbitrary F equation (24) is invariant with respect the Euclid group E(1, m) and so

admits 1 + m(m+1)

We will not discuss possible applications of the obtained results which consist in description
all possible models with non-trivial extention of the basic invariance with respect to the group

We stress that our classiﬁcation is valid for nonlinear SE with arbitrary number of spatial

increasing of calculations diﬃculties.

4 Note added to this preprint version

This preprint includes the contribution to the CRM Proceedings [16] which is slightly corrected
and added by the text placed in the ﬁrst half of Page 3. The reasons of its publication is caused
by the current interest in higher and arbitrary order integrals of motion, see, e.g., refs.
[14]
and [15]. I believe that the determining equations for such integrals, valid for arbitrary number
of independent variables, could be interesting for researcher working in this ﬁeld. Just these
equations were presented in [16] for more general case of non-stationary quantum mechanical
systems. And the additional text on Page 3 presents these equations reduced to the case of
stationary systems.
