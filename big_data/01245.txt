ABSTRACT

Context. Solar twins are increasingly the subject of many studies owing to their wide range of applications from testing stellar
evolution models to the calibration of fundamental observables; these stars are also of interest because high precision abundances
could be achieved that are key to investigating the chemical anomalies imprinted by planet formation. Furthermore, the advent of
photometric surveys with large telescopes motivates the identiﬁcation of faint solar twins in order to set the zero point of fundamental
calibrations.
Aims. We intend to perform a detailed line-by-line diﬀerential analysis to verify whether 2MASS J23263267-0239363 (designated
here as Inti 1) is indeed a solar twin.
Methods. We determine the atmospheric parameters and diﬀerential abundances using high-resolution (R ≈ 50000), high signal-to-
noise (S/N ≈ 110 - 240 per pixel) Keck HIRES spectra for our solar twin candidate, the previously known solar twin HD 45184, and
the Sun (using reﬂected light from the asteroid Vesta).
Results. For the bright solar twin HD 45184, we found Teﬀ = 5864 ± 9 K, log g = 4.45 ± 0.03 dex, vt = 1.11 ± 0.02 km s−1, and
[Fe/H]= 0.04 ± 0.01 dex, which are in good agreement with previous works. Our abundances are in excellent agreement with the
recent high-precision work by Nissen (2015) with an element-to-element scatter of only 0.01 dex. The star Inti 1 has atmospheric
parameters Teﬀ = 5837 ± 11 K, log g = 4.42 ± 0.03 dex, vt = 1.04 ± 0.02 km s−1, and [Fe/H]= 0.07 ± 0.01 dex that are higher than
solar. The age and mass of the solar twin HD 45184 (3 Gyr and 1.05 M(cid:12)) and the faint solar twin Inti 1 (4 Gyr and 1.04 M(cid:12)) were
estimated using isochrones. The diﬀerential analysis shows that HD 45184 presents an abundance pattern that is similar to typical
nearby solar twins; this means this star has an enhanced refractory relative to volatile elements, while Inti 1 has an abundance pattern
closer to solar, albeit somewhat enhanced in refractories. The abundance pattern of HD 45184 and Inti 1 could be reproduced by
adding ≈ 3.5 M⊕ and ≈ 1.5 M⊕ of Earth-like material to the convective zone of the Sun.
Conclusions. The star Inti 1 is a faint solar twin, therefore, it could be used to calibrate the zero points of diﬀerent photometric
systems. The distant solar twin Inti 1 has an abundance pattern similar to the Sun with only a minor enhancement in the refractory
elements. It would be important to analyze other distant solar twins to verify whether they share the Sun’s abundance pattern or if
they are enhanced in refractories, as is the case in the majority of nearby solar twins.
Key words. Sun: abundances – stars: abundances – stars: fundamental parameters – stars: solar-type – (stars:) planetary systems

1. Introduction
Cayrel de Strobel (1996) deﬁnes a solar twin as a star with
the same atmospheric parameters (eﬀective temperature, surface
gravity, and microturbulent velocity) as the Sun. The ﬁrst dis-
covery of a solar twin was made by Porto de Mello & da Silva
(1997), showing that 18 Sco has atmospheric parameters simi-
lar to the Sun. About a decade later three new solar twins were
found (King et al. 2005; Meléndez et al. 2006; Takeda et al.
2007), however, these three solar twins and 18 Sco have an over-
abundance of lithium by a factor of 3-6 higher than the Sun. Later
Meléndez & Ramírez (2007) discovered HIP 56948, which is the
best solar twin that we have until this point, with stellar parame-
ters and abundances that are similar to the Sun and a low lithium
abundance (Meléndez et al. 2012).

In the last few years, the number of solar twins have in-
creased to about 100 (Pasquini et al. 2008; Meléndez et al. 2009;

(cid:63) The data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observa-
tory, which is operated as a scientiﬁc partnership among the California
Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made pos-
sible by the generous ﬁnancial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation.

Ramírez et al. 2009; Takeda & Tajitsu 2009; Baumann et al.
2010; Önehag et al. 2011; Datson et al. 2012; do Nascimento
et al. 2013; Meléndez et al. 2014b; Porto de Mello et al. 2014;
Ramírez et al. 2014). Solar twins could be a useful source for
astronomical tests and applications. For example, they could set
the zero point of fundamental calibrations (Holmberg et al. 2006;
Casagrande et al. 2010; Datson et al. 2014), and they are used
to subtract the Sun’s reﬂected light on asteroids to study their
mineralogy (e.g., Lazzaro et al. 2004; Jasmim et al. 2013). So-
lar twins are also useful for testing stellar interior and evolution
models (e.g., Tucci Maia et al. 2015), investigating the chemical
evolution of the Galactic disk (Nissen 2015; Spina et al. 2016),
studying the rotational evolution of the Sun (do Nascimento et al.
2013, 2014), and measuring distances using spectroscopically
identiﬁed solar twins (Jofré et al. 2015).

Another application of solar twins is the study of refracto-
ries locked by planet formation. Meléndez et al. (2009) found
that the diﬀerence between abundances of the Sun relative to the
solar twins is not zero, showing that the Sun presents abundance
anomalies that are correlated with the condensation temperature,
TC, (Lodders 2003). The Sun presents a deﬁciency in refractory
(TC ≤ 900 K) relative to volatile (TC ≥ 900 K) elements, which

could be a signature of rocky planet formation (Chambers 2010).
Later, Ramírez et al. (2009) supported this idea by studying the
abundance of 64 stars with fundamental parameters similar to
the Sun; their result showed a strong relation between the abun-
dances and condensation temperature in the majority of their
sample. Other authors have been investigating this relation with
the existence of planets, although the results are still not conclu-
sive (Gonzalez et al. 2010; Schuler et al. 2011; Adibekyan et al.
2014; Maldonado et al. 2015a; Nissen 2015). Are the abundance
anomalies a phenomenon restricted to the solar neighborhood or
is it also present in other regions of the Galaxy? This could be
investigated using distant solar twins.

In this paper, we report the discovery of the faint solar twin
2MASS J23263267-0239363, which we call Inti 11 for practical
reasons.

2. Spectroscopy observations and data reduction
Inti 1 was observed with the HIRES spectrograph (Vogt
et al. 1994) at the Keck I telescope at the coordinates (α =
23:26:32.61, δ = -2:39:35.3) because it was mistaken for the car-
bon star BPS CS 22949-0037, whose coordinates are actually (α
= 23:26:29.80, δ = -2:39:57.94). This mistake was due to their
proximity (Fig. 1). We intended to take two exposures of 1200
s, but after the ﬁrst exposure it was realized that the star ob-
served was not BPS CS 22949-0037, and the planned exposure
sequence was terminated after only one exposure. Fortunately,
in the same night we observed the Sun using the same setup. A
recent inspection of the spectrum of the wrongly observed tar-
get revealed a similarity to the solar spectrum (see Fig. 2), thus
making Inti 1 a good candidate to be a solar twin, which we con-
ﬁrmed after high precision analysis. During the same observing
run, we also obtained a spectrum for the bright solar twin HD
45184 (e.g., Nissen 2015).

The spectra of HD 45184, Inti 1 and the Sun (using so-
lar reﬂected light from the Vesta asteroid), were obtained with
HIRES/Keck on November 1-3, 2004, covering the wavelength
region from 3190-5980 Å. The exposure time for HD 45184, Inti
1 and Vesta were 2×300 s, 1200 s, and 100 s. The spectral reso-
lution, R = λ/λ∆ is about 50000, while the signal-to-noise ratios

1 Inti is Quechua for ‘Sun’

(S/N) estimated for HD 45184, Inti 1 and Vesta are 160, 110 and
240 per pixel.

The spectra were extracted using the MAKEE2 pipeline that
was speciﬁcally designed by T. Barlow to reduce HIRES spec-
tra. The standard procedure is followed with bias subtraction,
ﬂat ﬁelding, sky subtraction, order extraction, and wavelength
calibration. We note that MAKEE already applies the heliocen-
tric correction, so that the output wavelengths are heliocentric.
Further processing was performed with IRAF3.

We estimated the radial velocity of the star using the
rvidlines task in IRAF, and then the spectrum was corrected
to the rest frame with the dopcor task. The spectra were nor-
malized using IRAF’s continuum task with orders of the poly-
nomial spline varying from 1 to 5 for each order. In Fig. 2 we
show a part of the reduced spectra of HD 45184, Inti 1, and the
Sun in the region 5321-5336 Å, where we can see that both stars
have an impressive resemblance to the Sun.

The similarity between Inti 1 and the Sun also extends
to colors; using VIZIER4, we found the magnitudes5: V =
12.857 ± 0.028, B = 13.516 ± 0.032, I = 12.045 ± 0.072,
J = 11.559 ± 0.023, H = 11.247 ± 0.023, K = 11.168 ± 0.024,
W1 = 11.125 ± 0.023, and W2 = 11.180 ± 0.022. Inti 1
and the Sun present similar color magnitudes (Table 1) rein-
forcing the idea that it is a solar twin. Extinction coeﬃcients
for (B − V), (V − I), (V − J), (V − H), (V − K) photometry were
taken from Ramírez & Meléndez (2005) and for (V − W1),
(V − W2) from Yuan et al. (2013). For the extinction correction,
we used E(B − V)6 = 0.044 ± 0.002 , that is from the reddening
maps of Schlegel et al. (1998), with the correction proposed by
Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011).

3. Abundance analysis
We adopted the line list of Meléndez et al. (2014a) to measure
the equivalent widths (EWs) of the spectral lines; we used the
IRAF splot task and ﬁtted the line proﬁles using Gaussians.

† The parameters reported here are based on the diﬀerential stellar parameters and adopting for the Sun Teﬀ= 5777 K, log g = 4.44 dex and
vt = 1.00 km s−1.

The pseudo-continuum regions were determined as in Bedell
et al. (2014) in a window of 8 Å.

In order to compute the stellar parameters, we employed
the MARCS model atmospheres (Gustafsson et al. 2008) and
the 2014 version of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
code MOOG (Sneden 1973). The LTE is adequate for diﬀerential
studies of solar twins, as the diﬀerential NLTE (non-LTE) eﬀects
in solar twins are negligible (Meléndez et al. 2012; Monroe et al.
2013).

Spectroscopic equilibrium is used to determine the eﬀective
temperature (Teﬀ), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]),
and microturbulent velocity (vt). This is performed by imposing
the relative excitation and ionization equilibrium, and evaluating
the lack of dependence of diﬀerential iron abundance with re-
duced equivalent width (EW/λ). All the calculations are strictly
diﬀerential (∆Ai)7.
As a ﬁrst step, we determined the abundances of the Sun
(A(cid:12)
i ) for each line, adopting the standard solar parameters (Teﬀ =
5777 K, log g = 4.44 dex (Cox 2000), and vt = 1.00 km s−1 as in
Ramírez et al. (2014)). The second step is the determination of
stellar parameters of Inti 1; initially we set as the atmospheric pa-
rameters those of the Sun, then the abundances (A(cid:63)
i ) were found
running the MOOG code. We achieved the spectroscopic solu-
tion varying the values for the parameters until achieving diﬀer-
ential spectroscopic equilibrium (Fig. 3).
We ﬁrst study the bright solar twin HD 45184 to validate our
method. The stellar parameters that we found are Teﬀ = 5864±9
K, log g = 4.45±0.03 dex, vt = 1.11±0.02 km s−1, and [Fe/H] =
0.04 ± 0.01 dex. These values are in a good agreement with all
previous works found in the literature, as shown in Table 2, as
well as in good accord with the weighted mean value, Teﬀ =
5863±5 K, log g = 4.44±0.01 dex, vt = 1.05±0.02 km s−1, and
[Fe/H] = 0.040±0.004 dex. The stellar parameters found for Inti
1 are Teﬀ = 5837±11 K, log g = 4.42±0.03 dex, vt = 1.04±0.02
km s−1, and [Fe/H] = 0.07±0.01 dex. According to the solar twin
deﬁnition of Ramírez et al. (2009), a solar twin should be within
∆Teﬀ = 100 K, ∆log g = 0.1 dex, and ∆[Fe/H] = 0.1 dex of the
Sun; our results agree with this deﬁnition, hence, Inti 1 is a solar
twin.

Once the atmospheric parameters were set, we measured the
abundances of 18 elements other than iron using atomic lines: C,
Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Ce, and
Nd. For carbon we also used CH molecular lines and for nitrogen

we used NH. The hyperﬁne correction was made for Mn, Co, Y,
and Cu, adopting the HFS data from Meléndez et al. (2014a). We
compare our abundances for the bright solar twin HD 45184 with
the most precise abundances available (Fig. 4), which are from
Nissen (2015). We found a diﬀerence (this work - Nissen (2015))
of ∆[X/H] = 0.007 (σ = 0.009 dex) and ∆[X/Fe] = 0.000 (σ =
0.009 dex). This shows that our precision is about 0.01 dex. We
also compared with two other works in the literature, resulting

Hernández et al. (2010).

The diﬀerential abundances for HD 45184 and Inti 1 are pre-
sented in Table 4, including the observational errors and system-
atic errors (due to uncertainties in the stellar parameters), and we
also included the total error obtained from quadratically adding
the statistical and systematic errors.

We computed the mass and age of HD 45184 and Inti 1 us-
ing our atmospheric parameters and employing the q2 (qoyllur-
quipu) code8 . This code is based in python and was developed
by Ramírez et al. (2014), to determine the masses and ages of
stars using the Yonsei-Yale isochrones (e.g., Yi et al. 2001).

Our results show a mass of 1.05 M(cid:12) and 1.04 M(cid:12) for HD
45184 and Inti 1. The age obtained is about 3 Gyr and 4 Gyr for
HD 45184 and Inti 1 (Fig. 5). The mass and age of HD 45184
are in excellent agreement with the weighted mean value found
in the literature (Table 2). The Yonsei-Yale grids of stellar mod-
els do not include nonstandard physics such as those included in
studies of lithium depletion (Do Nascimento et al. 2009; Denis-
senkov 2010; Li et al. 2012). We tested our method for the star
18 Sco, which was analyzed using nonstandard models by Li
et al. (2012), and found the same mass and age. Furthermore,
Meléndez et al. (2014a) shows that the exact choice of isochrone

A comparison between our chemical pattern and that of Nissen
(2015) is shown in Fig. 6. It is reassuring that we get the same
trend as the precise work by Nissen (2015). In Fig. 7 we show
the diﬀerential abundances normalized to carbon for HD 45184
(upper panel) and Inti 1 (lower panel), as a function of conden-
sation temperature (Lodders 2003). The chemical pattern of HD
46184 follows the abundance pattern of the ﬁt of the mean trend
of 11 solar twins studied by Meléndez et al. (2009), as shown
by the dashed lines after a vertical shift. Inti 1 has an abundance
pattern closer to solar, albeit slightly enhanced in refractories.
The oﬀset between the refractory and volatiles elements of HD
45184 and Inti 1 are 0.076 dex and 0.025 dex, respectively.
Nissen (2015) showed that the [Y/Mg] ratio is an age indica-
tor. Using his relation, we estimate ages of 3.7 ± 0.6 Gyr and 4.1

± 0.6 Gyr for HD 45184 and Inti 1; these results are in agreement
with the isochronal ages computed by using q2.

Following Chambers (2010), we computed the mass of rocky
material needed to reproduce the abundance trend of HD 45184
and Inti 1. Our results show a value of 3.5 ± 1 M⊕ of refractory
elements using a mixture of Earth-like and CM-chondrite-like
material for HD 45184 and 1.5 ± 1 M⊕ for Inti 1. These patterns
are represented by blue ﬁlled triangles in Fig. (7).
We developed a code9 in python to make this calculation
easier. The code ﬁrst computes the convective mass of a solar

twin, and then estimates the mass of the rocky material miss-
ing in the convective zone. The convective mass is calculated
making a double interpolation to the mass and metallicity of the
solar twin. The convective masses adopted for this calculation
are from Siess et al. (2000)10 .

Once the convective mass is obtained, the code computes the
convective mass of each element present in the Sun, adopting
the abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). Adopting the same ap-
proach, we use the abundances of Wasson & Kallemeyn (1988)
and Allègre et al. (2001) for the chemical composition of CM
chondrites and the Earth. This is explained in more detail in ap-

calculations for Inti 1 are listed in Table 3.

To verify our results, we reproduced the calculation of
Chambers (2010) in Fig. 8, adding a mixture of 2 M⊕ of Earth-
like material and 2 M⊕ of chondrite-like material. Our abun-
dances are represented by blue ﬁlled circles, while the abun-

dances of Chambers by ﬁlled red stars. Our results agree well
with the calculation of Chambers, who used the same meteoritic
composition as us, but he adopted another reference for the Earth
(Waenke & Dreibus 1988).

5. Conclusions
Our atmospheric parameters computed relative to the Sun for
HD 45184 are Teﬀ = 5864 ± 9 K, log g = 4.45 ± 0.03 dex,
vt = 1.11±0.02 km s−1, and [Fe/H]= 0.04±0.01 dex, and for the
faint solar twin Inti 1 are Teﬀ = 5837± 11 K, log g = 4.42± 0.03
dex, vt = 1.04 ± 0.02 km s−1, and [Fe/H]= 0.07 ± 0.01 dex,
meaning that our star Inti 1 is a solar twin (Ramírez et al. 2009).
In Table 1 we showed that the colors of Inti 1 are identical to the
Sun within errors. Thus our faint solar solar twin and the distant
solar twin found by do Nascimento et al. (2013) could be used
to calibrate diﬀerent photometric surveys.

The abundances of HD 45184 shows an excellent agreement
with the highly precise work by Nissen (2015). HD 45184 and
Inti 1 present enhancement in the refractory elements compared
to volatiles species with an oﬀset of 0.076 dex and 0.025 dex,
respectively. This demonstrates that the same chemical anoma-
lies found when the Sun is compared to local solar twins are
also present when compared to distant solar twins (albeit the re-
fractory enhancement of Inti 1 is smaller than for the nearby
solar twin HD 45184). Using our code and theoretical models
from Siess et al. (2000), we estimated the mass of rocky mate-
rial present in the convective zone for HD 45184 (≈ 3.5 M⊕) and
Inti 1 (≈ 1.5 M⊕), relative to the Sun.

The lithium abundances are usually determined from the
6708 Å resonance line (or sometimes from the 6104 Å subordi-
nate line). Hence, they were not measured because of our limited
spectral coverage (3190-5980 Å). However, future observations
will allow us to determine the Li abundance of Inti 1, and verify
if the star follows the lithium-age correlation (e.g., Monroe et al.
2013).

Appendix A: Estimating the missing mass of rocky

material

(A.1)

Adopting the abundance of Asplund et al. (2009) for the chem-
ical composition of the Sun (Asun), and using [Fe/H] of a given
star, we could estimate the mass of rocky material missing from
its convective zone. First we have to compute the mass of each
element, which is given by
Xconv_mass = A × 10(Asun + [Fe/H]),
where A is the atomic weight. Then the convective mass of each
element is given by
Convectivemass = Mconv × M(cid:12) × Xconv_mass
(A.2)
where Mconv is the Sun’s convective mass (∼ 0.02M(cid:12)). For com-
puting the meteoritic mass, we adopted the abundance of Was-
son & Kallemeyn (1988) as composition of chondrites, and for
the terrestrial mass we adopted the abundance of Allègre et al.
(2001), following the equations:
Meteoriticmass = M⊕ × Xmet_mass
Terrestrialmass = M⊕ × Xterr_mass
