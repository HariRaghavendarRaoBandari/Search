Floquet theory provides rigorous foundations for the theory of periodically driven quantum sys-
tems. In the case of non-periodic driving, however, the situation is not so well understood. Here,
we provide a critical review of the theoretical framework developed for quasi-periodically driven
quantum systems. Although the theoretical footing is still under development, we argue that quasi-
periodically driven quantum systems can be treated with generalizations of Floquet theory in suitable
parameter regimes. Moreover, we provide a generalization of the Floquet-Magnus expansion and
argue that quasi-periodic driving oﬀers a promising route for quantum simulations.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of quantum systems induced by a time-
dependent Hamiltonian attracts attention from various
communities. Chemical reactions can be controlled with
driving induced by laser beams [1], and driving atoms
permits to investigate their electronic structure [2]. Suit-
ably chosen driving sequences permit to investigate dy-
namics in macro-molecular complexes [3] and there exist
phases in solid state systems that can be accessed only
in the presence of driving [4, 5]. A neat bridge between
quantum optics and solid state physics is built by the fact
that periodically driven atomic gases can be employed as
quantum simulators for models of solid state theory [6, 7].
equation with a time-
dependent Hamiltonian calls for diﬀerent mathematical
techniques than those applied in situations with time-
independent Hamiltonians. Diﬀerential equations with
time-dependent coeﬃcients have been investigated thor-
oughly and,
in particular, developments regarding re-
ducibility are appreciated, since they permit to un-
derstand driven systems in terms of time-independent
Hamiltonians [8].

Solving the Schr¨odinger

The foundation for this is laid by the Floquet theorem
[9], which relates a periodically time-dependent with a
constant Hamiltonian. This mathematical theorem pro-
vides the basis for experiments that employ periodically
driven quantum systems for quantum simulations of sys-
tems with time-independent Hamiltonians. Such exper-
iments have led to the experimental observation of e.g.
coherent suppression of tunneling [10–12], spin-orbit cou-
pling [13, 14], synthetic magnetism [15–17], ferromag-
netic domains [18], or topological band structures [19, 20]
The speciﬁc time-dependence of the driving force plays
a crucial role in the dynamics that driven systems can
undergo. Yet, despite the possibility to experimentally
tune it, very simple driving protocols are usually em-
ployed, which can signiﬁcantly limit the performance of
the simulations [21] and restrict the range of accessible
dynamics [22, 23].

In this context, pulse-shaping techniques have been in-
troduced in order to achieve the simulation of the desired
eﬀective dynamics in an optimal fashion [21, 23]. Yet, the
restriction to periodic driving is a limitation, and quasi-

periodic driving,
i.e. driving with a time-dependence
characterized by several frequencies that can be irra-
tionally related, promises substantially enhanced control
over the quantum system at hand. Since the use of quasi-
periodic driving [24–26], however, implies that Floquet
theorem is not applicable, the mathematical foundation
is far less solid than in the case of periodic driving.

Generalizations of Floquet’s theorem to quasi-periodic
driving have been pursued both in the quantum
physics/chemistry literature [27, 28] and in the math-
ematical literature [8, 29–31]. The former perspective
approaches quasi-periodic driving as a limiting case of
periodic systems, while the mathematical literature ap-
proaches quasi-periodicity without resorting to results
from periodic systems. Beyond the fundamentally dif-
ferent approaches, also the ﬁndings in the diﬀerent com-
munities are not always consistent with each other.

The goal of the present article is twofold. On the one
hand, we discuss prior literature on the generalization
of Floquet’s theorem to quasi-periodic systems, and at-
tempt to overview over what ﬁndings have been veriﬁed
to mathematical rigour, and what ﬁndings are rather
based on case studies and still lack a general, rigorous
foundation. On the other hand, we aim at studying the
possibility to use quasi-periodically driven systems for
quantum simulations.

We consider quasi-periodic Hamiltonians H(t) that can
be deﬁned in terms of a Fourier-like representation of the
form

Hnein·ωt,

H(t) =

(1)
where ω = (ω1,··· , ωd) is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector of
real frequencies that are irrationally related, and n =
(n1,··· , nd) is a vector of integers such that n · ω =
n1ω1 +··· + ndωd. Moreover, the norm of coeﬃcients Hn
are considered to decay suﬃciently fast with |n|.

The main underlying question of the present work is
the possibility to express the time-evolution operator
U (t) of a quasi-periodically driven system in terms of
a generalized Floquet representation of the form

n Unein·ωt is a quasi-periodic unitary charac-

UQ(t) =(cid:80)

terized by the same fundamental frequency vector ω as
the quasi-periodic Hamiltonian H(t).
If the frequency
vector ω deﬁning the quasi-periodicity of H(t) contains
only one element, i.e. d = 1, the Hamiltonian becomes
periodic with period 2π/ω1 and the decomposition in Eq.
(2) reduces to the usual Floquet representation, which is
known to exist. However, if ω contains more than one
element, i.e. d > 1, the Hamiltonian is not periodic and
the representation in Eq. (2) is a priori not guaranteed.
The possibility to represent the time-evolution opera-
tor of a quasi-periodically driven system as in Eq. (2) is
directly related to the problem of reducibility [32, 33] of
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations with quasi-periodic coef-
ﬁcients, which is still an ongoing problem in the mathe-
matics community [34]. Unlike their periodic counter-
parts,
linear diﬀerential equations with quasi-periodic
coeﬃcients cannot always be reduced to constant co-
eﬃcients by means of a quasi-periodic transformation
[35, 36], although a quasi-periodic Floquet reducibility
theory does exist [29, 37].

Generalizations of Floquet theory to quasi-periodically
driven systems have been derived also from a less
mathematical perspective. Many-mode Floquet theory
(MMFT) [27, 38–40] is based on physical assumptions of
the underlying time-dependent Hamiltonian, and it has
been successfully applied to a variety of systems rang-
ing from quantum chemistry [27, 41] to quantum optics
[42, 43]. However, it does not seem to have an entirely
rigorous footing yet.

In this article, we address these diﬀerent perspectives
and argue that, despite gaps in a general mathemati-
cal footing, concepts from regular Floquet theory can be
translated directly to quasi-periodically driven systems,
especially in fast-driving regimes, i.e. the regime of quan-
tum simulations.

In Sec. II we introduce notation and preliminary con-
cepts of Floquet theory that will be used throughout the
article. In Sec. III, we revise critically the MMFT and
point out aspects of the derivation that cast doubts on
the general validity of the proof. In Sec. IV we argue
how, nevertheless, the general formalism of MMFT can
still lead to valid results, in agreement with prior work
[28, 38–40, 42–44]. In Sec. V, we derive a generalization
of the Floquet-Magnus expansion [45], which provides a
perturbative exponential expansion of the time-evolution
operator that has the desired structure. With this, we ad-
vocate the possibility to identify eﬀective Hamiltonians
that characterize well the eﬀective dynamics of quasi-
periodically driven systems in a fast-driving regime, and
exemplify in Sec. VI the results with a quasi-periodically
driven Lambda system.

characterizing the time-evolution operator ˜U (t) of a sys-
tem described by a periodic Hamiltonian ˜H(t) = ˜H(t +
T ), is reducible. That is, there exists a periodic unitary
UP (t) = UP (t + T ) that transforms the Schr¨odinger op-
erator ˜K(t) = ˜H(t) − i∂t into

†
P (t) = HF − i∂t ,
UP (t) ˜K(t)U
†
†
P (t)−iUP (t)(∂tU
where HF = UP (t) ˜H(t)U
P (t)) is a time-
independent Hamiltonian [46]. As a consequence, the
time-evolution operator of the system can be represented
as the product

(4)

˜U (t) = U

†
P (t)e

−iHF t,

(5)

with UP (0) = 1. This decomposition is of central impor-
tance in the context of quantum simulations with period-
ically driven systems because it ensures that, in a suitable
fast-driving regime, the dynamics of the driven system
can be approximated in terms of the time-independent
Hamiltonian HF [6, 7].
The eigenstates |k(cid:105) of the Hamiltonian HF form a
basis in the system Hilbert space H, on which the pe-
riodic Hamiltonian ˜H(t) acts. Thus, any vector |φ(0)(cid:105)
characterizing the initial state of the system can be writ-
ten as a linear combination of the eigenstates |k(cid:105). Con-
sequently, the decomposition of the time-evolution op-
erator in Eq.
(5) implies that time-dependent states
|φ(t)(cid:105) = ˜U (t)|φ(0)(cid:105) can be expressed as a linear combina-
tion with time-independent coeﬃcients of Floquet states
of the form

|φk(t)(cid:105) = e

−ikt|uk(t)(cid:105),

(6)

where k are the eigenvalues of HF (also termed
†
quasienergies), and |uk(t)(cid:105) = U
P (t)|k(cid:105) = |uk(t + T )(cid:105)
are periodic state vectors.

The quasienergies k play a very important role in
the dynamics of driven systems. They can be calcu-
lated after inserting the Floquet states in Eq. (6) into
the Schr¨odinger equation i∂t|φk(t)(cid:105) = ˜H(t)|φk(t)(cid:105), which
yields

˜K(t)|uk(t)(cid:105) = k|uk(t)(cid:105) .

(7)

Eq. (7) formally describes an eigenvalue problem resem-
bling the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation, where
the periodic states |uk(t)(cid:105) play an analogous role of sta-
tionary states. Due to the time-dependence of the states
and the action of the derivative in ˜K(t), however, the
diagonalization in Eq. (7) cannot be straightforwardly
solved with standard matrix diagonalization techniques.
For this reason, it is often convenient to formulate the
problem in a Fourier space where the operator ˜K(t) is
treated as an inﬁnite-dimensional time-independent op-
erator [47, 48].

Floquet’s theorem [9] asserts that the Schr¨odinger

equation

i∂t ˜U (t) = ˜H(t) ˜U (t),

State vectors of the driven system are deﬁned on the
system Hilbert space H, where time is regarded as a pa-

(3)

rameter. In order to arrive at a formalism in which the
parameter ‘time’ does not appear explicitly, one exploits
the fact that the states |u(t)(cid:105) in H that have a peri-
odic time-dependence can be deﬁned on a Floquet Hilbert
space F = H⊗L2(T), where L2(T) is the Hilbert space of
periodic functions [48]. In this Floquet space, time is not
regarded as a parameter but rather as a coordinate of the
new Hilbert space. The explicit time-dependence of the
system can then be removed by adopting a Fourier rep-
resentation of the periodic states in the space F. Fourier
series permit the characterization of periodic functions in
terms of a sequence of its Fourier coeﬃcients. Formally,
this can be described through an isomorphism between
the space L2(T) of periodic functions and the space l2(Z)
of square-summable sequences. This isomorphism allows
one to map the exponential functions einωt, which form a
basis in L2(T), to states |n(cid:105), which deﬁne an orthonormal
basis in l2(Z).

In this manner, periodic states |u(t)(cid:105) =(cid:80)

n n|n(cid:105)(cid:104)n| satisfying
ˆn|n(cid:105) = n|n(cid:105) and the commutation relation [ˆn, σm] =
mσm.
Consequently, the isomorphism between F and H ⊗
l2(Z) permits one to treat the periodic system within a
Fourier formalism by mapping the Schr¨odinger operator
˜K(t) = ˜H(t) − i∂t to the operator [49]

which can be readily veriﬁed by inserting Eq. (12) into
the Schr¨odinger equation and using the explicit form of
˜K given in Eq.
(11), as we explicitely demonstrate in
Appendix for illustrative purposes.
The operator ˜K in Eq. (11) is often represented as an
inﬁnite-dimensional matrix. The Floquet states in Eq.
(6) can be obtained from the diagonalization of ˜K [47].
In order to ﬁnd the Floquet decomposition of the time-
evolution operator in Eq. (5), however, it is not necessary

to completely diagonalize the operator ˜K. Instead, the
operator ˜K needs to be brought into the block-diagonal
form

diagonalization is achieved, the Floquet Hamiltonian

III. MANY-MODE FLOQUET THEORY

REVISED

The many-mode Floquet theory (MMFT) [27, 38–40]
was introduced in the context of quantum chemistry as a
generalization of Floquet theory to treat systems with
a quasi-periodic time dependence. The derivation of
MMFT is rooted on Floquet’s theorem and its proposed
generality contrasts with other results derived with more
rigorous approaches. In this section, we revise the deriva-
tion of MMFT and challenge aspects of the proof that
question its general validity.

periodic Hamiltonian H(t) = (cid:80)

The derivation of the MMFT [27] consists in approx-
imating the quasi-periodic Hamiltonian H(t) by a pe-
riodic Hamiltonian and, then, using Floquet theory to
demonstrate the existence of a generalized Floquet de-
composition for the time-evolution operator of the sys-
tem. The derivation [27] starts by considering a quasi-
(1)
and approximating the diﬀerent elements ωi of the fre-
quency vector ω by a fraction. Then, a small fundamen-
tal driving frequency ω is identiﬁed such that the diﬀerent
irrationally-related frequencies ωi are expressed as

n Hnein·ωt in Eq.

ωi ≈ Ni ω,

(15)

with some integers Ni.
In this manner, the quasi-
periodically driven Hamiltonian H(t) can be approxi-
mated by the periodic Hamiltonian

˜H(t) =

Hnein·Nωt,

(16)

(cid:88)

n

where N = (N1,··· , Nd). The validity of the approxi-
mation H(t) ≈ ˜H(t) for a certain time window impor-
tantly depends on the good behavior of the Hamiltonian
and on the approximation in Eq.
(15), which can be
performed with any desired accuracy. When the approx-
imation H(t) ≈ ˜H(t) is satisﬁed with suﬃcient accuracy,
the time-evolution operator U (t) of the quasi-periodically
driven system can be also approximated by the time-
evolution operator ˜U (t) that is induced by the periodic
approximated Hamiltonian ˜H(t), i.e. U (t) ≈ ˜U (t).

The next step in the derivation aims at demonstrating
that time-evolution operator ˜U (t) of the periodic Hamil-
tonian ˜H(t) can be approximately represented by a gen-
eralized Floquet decomposition analogous to Eq.
(2).
Speciﬁcally, the aim is to express the periodic unitary
UP (t) of the Floquet decomposition in Eq. (5) in terms
of a Fourier series of the form

UP (t) =

Unein·Nωt,

(17)

(cid:88)

n

UQ(t) = (cid:80)

which contains only speciﬁc Fourier components, since,
in general, not all integers can be expressed as n · N
with a vector of integers n.
If this was possible for
an arbitrarily small frequency ω, the unitary UP (t) in
Eq.
(17) would approximate a quasi-periodic unitary
n Unein·ωt and the time-evolution operator
of the quasi-periodically driven system could be well ap-
proximated by the sought generalized Floquet decompo-
sition in Eq. (2).

The MMFT derivation [27] considers, for concreteness,
a quasi-periodic Hamiltonian H(t) in Eq. (1) with d = 2;
that is, the frequency vector contains only two compo-
nents: ω1 and ω2. Moreover, the only non-vanishing co-
eﬃcients Hn of the quasi-periodic Hamiltonian are H(0,0),
H(±1,0), and H(0,±1). Despite this speciﬁc choice, how-
ever, the possibility to generalize the results to Hamilto-
nians containing more frequencies is claimed.

In order to demonstrate the possibility to write the
(17), the derivation in [27] makes use
unitary in Eq.
of the time-independent Floquet formalism described in
Sec. II. First of all, the operator ˜K in Eq. (11) is deﬁned
(using a slightly diﬀerent notation) for the approximated
periodic Hamiltonian ˜H(t) in Eq.
(16) [50]. Then, a
block-diagonal structure is given to ˜K as a ﬁrst step to
achieve the desired structure of the time-evolution oper-
ator.
The block-diagonal structure is obtained by ‘rela-
belling’ each vector |n(cid:105) that forms a basis of l2(Z) (intro-
duced in Sec. II A) as

4

n n|n(cid:105)(cid:104)n|, and ˆp =(cid:80)

troduced in Eq. (21) are deﬁned as σn =(cid:80)
ˆn =(cid:80)

The ladder operator σn and number operators ˆn and ˆp in-
m |m+n(cid:105)(cid:104)m|,
p p|p(cid:105)(cid:104)p|, respectively, where
the summations include all possible values of n and p.
The notation of the states |n(cid:105) introduced in Eq. (18),
and the tensor structure given to the them and to the
operator ˜K in Eq. (20) is of central importance in the
derivation of MMFT and is the main focus of our criti-
cism.

A linear Diophantine equation of the form in Eq.
(19) with unknowns p and ni can always be solved
independently of the speciﬁc integer values n and Ni
[51].
In fact, it has inﬁnitely many solutions. For in-
stance, given a solution {np} it is always possible to
obtain another solution by redeﬁning the vector n as
n(cid:48) = (n1 + zN2, n2 − zN1) with an arbitrary integer z.
For this reason, it is not possible to uniquely associate a
single vector |np(cid:105) with each vector |n(cid:105) without a speciﬁc
prescription of which solution to choose. Such prescrip-
tion, however, is not given in [27] and is not compatible
with the tensor structure provided [27].
Problems arising from the ambiguity in the identiﬁca-
tion of the vector |np(cid:105) in Eq. (18) become apparent when
considering e.g. the scalar product of two states |np(cid:105) and
|n(cid:48)p(cid:48)(cid:105) that correspond to two solutions {np} and {n(cid:48)p(cid:48)}.
The scalar product (cid:104)np|n(cid:48)p(cid:48)(cid:105) vanishes if the two solu-
tions are diﬀerent. However, with the original notation
both states are associated with the same state |n(cid:105) and
the corresponding scalar product (cid:104)n|n(cid:105) does not vanish,
which leads to an inconsistency. This problem becomes
especially relevant when considering the expression of the
operator ˜K in Eq. (20), which contains inﬁnitely many
diﬀerent matrix elements (cid:104)np| ˜K|mq(cid:105) that correspond to
the same matrix element (cid:104)n| ˜K|m(cid:105) of the operator ˜K in
Eq. (11). That is, the operator ˜Kbd in Eq. (20) is in fact
not a mere rewritten version of ˜K in Eq. (11) but rather
a diﬀerent operator.

A central step in the derivation of MMFT is the exis-
tence of a unitary transformation relating the operators
˜Kbd deﬁned in Eq. (20) and

˜Kd = KB ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ω ˆp

KB = HF ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ω · ˆn

(22)

(23)

where the vector of integers n = (n1, n2) and the integer
p are found by solving the Diophantine equation

niNi + p

(19)

with

n =

|np(cid:105),

2(cid:88)

i=1

for all n and for the integers Ni in Eq. (15). Thereafter,
a tensor product structure is given to the Hilbert space
l2(Z), such that the state vectors in Eq. (18) are written
in the tensor product form |np(cid:105) = |n(cid:105)|p(cid:105), with |n(cid:105) =
|n1(cid:105)|n2(cid:105) and where n1, n2, and p can take all integer

described to be rewritten in the block-diagonal form

˜Kbd = K ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ω ˆp,

with

K =

Hn ⊗ σn + 1 ⊗ ω · ˆn.

(cid:88)

n

The existence would follow from a bi-jective relation be-
tween |n(cid:105) and |np(cid:105); but since such a relation does not
exist, the unitary equivalence between the two operators
does not necessarily hold true.

The notation introduced in Eq. (18) is also employed
to express the time-evolution operator ˜U (t) in Eq. (12)
as

(cid:104)n1n2p|e

−i ˜Kt|000(cid:105)einωt.

(24)

∞(cid:88)

n1,n2,p=−∞

This expression, however, contains inﬁnitely many dupli-
cate terms since there are inﬁnitely many vectors (cid:104)n1n2p|

that correspond to the same vector (cid:104)n|, according to the
prescription given by the Diophantine equation in Eq.
(19). Eq. (24) is thus not a reformulation of the expres-
sion of the time-evolution operator in Eq. (12).

The derivation of MMFT [27] achieves the desired
structure of the time-evolution operator by combining
the expression for the time-evolution operator ˜U (t) in Eq.
(24) with the expression for the operator ˜K in Eq. (20).
Given the doubts on the unitary equivalence between ˜Kbd
and ˜Kd and the correctness of Eq. (24), it seems to us
that the derivation of MMFT is not complete.

Besides a Floquet-like decomposition for quasi-periodic
systems, MMFT also describes a method to calculate
the time-evolution operator by diagonalizing a time-
independent operator perturbatively or numerically, in
a similar way as described in Eq. (13) for periodic sys-
tems [47]. Speciﬁcally, it is argued [27] that ﬁnding the
unitary transformation that relates ˜Kbd and ˜Kd is essen-
tially equivalent to transforming K in Eq. (21) to KB in
Eq. (23). This method has then been applied in a variety
of ﬁelds, leading to successful results [28, 38–40, 42–44].
In the next section we will give an explanation why,
despite arguing that the proof of MMFT is not entirely
rigorous and possibly incomplete, this method can still
lead to valid results. We shall do this without imposing
any intermediate periodicity in the system but rather by
directly deﬁning an extended Hilbert space, in an analo-
gous way as described in Sec. II A for periodic systems.

IV. QUASI-PERIODIC REDUCIBILITY IN

FOURIER SPACE

The possibility to express the time-evolution operator
U (t) of quasi-periodically driven systems in a generalized
Floquet decomposition can be formulated in terms of the
reducibility of the Schr¨odinger equation, as described in
Sec. II A for periodic systems. In the quasi-periodic case,
we seek a quasi-periodic unitary UQ(t) that transforms
the operator K(t) = H(t) − i∂t to

†
Q(t) = HQ − i∂t,
UQ(t)K(t)U
†
†
Q(t)−iUP (t)(∂tU

H ⊗ L2(Td), where H is the original system’s Hilbert
space and L2(Td) is the space of square-integrable func-
tions on a d-dimensional torus. Thereafter, the iso-
morphism between the space L2(Td) and the sequence
space l2(Zd) can be employed to work within a time-
independent or Fourier formalism. In this manner, quasi-
n Bnein·ωt can be mapped

periodic operators B(t) = (cid:80)

ﬁned in terms of a basis |n(cid:105) of the sequence space l2(Zd)
and satisfy σn|m(cid:105) = |n + m(cid:105). Similarly, the derivative
operator −i∂t can be mapped to

ˆn|n(cid:105) = n|n(cid:105) and the commutation relation [ˆn, σm] =

sociated to the operator

since it describes a quasi-periodic unitary.

The block-diagonalization described in Eq. (29) oﬀers
an alternative formulation of the transformation in Eq.
(25), and indeed coincides with the transformation relat-
ing ˜Kbd and ˜Kd deﬁned in Eqs. (20) and (22). That is,
even if the general premise of MMFT is not satisﬁed, its
explicit application is still correct as long as reducibility
holds.

In Sec. II A, we have described how the transforma-
tion in Eq. (4)—which is known to exist due to Floquet’s
theorem—can be solved within a time-independent for-
malism using Fourier series. Here, we expand this formal-
ism to include quasi-periodic systems and show how the
transformation in Eq. (25) can be similarly formulated in
terms of the block-diagonalization of a time-independent
operator. With this, we will not aim at proving the exis-
tence of the decomposition of the time-evolution operator
in Eq. (2), but rather assume its existence and construct
the corresponding eﬀective Hamiltonian.

Similarly as described in Sec.

tems, the Fourier coeﬃcients of quasi-periodic states

V. GENERALIZED FLOQUET-MAGNUS

EXPANSION

General results of reducibility for ﬁrst-order diﬀerential
equations with quasi-periodic coeﬃcients are not to be
expected [32, 33], but the situation is better understood
if the driving amplitude is small as compared to the norm
|ω| of the frequency vector. Using unitless variables τ =
|ω|t, which are common in the mathematical literature,
the corresponding diﬀerential equation reads

i∂τ U (τ ) =

H(τ )
|ω| U (τ ) .

(31)

The regime of the new rescaled Hamiltonian, which is
quasi-periodic with frequencies ω/|ω|, is referred to a
close-to-constant, whereas the term fast driving is more
common in the physics literature.
In this regime and
under suitable hypothesis of regularity, non-degeneracy
and strong nonresonance of the frequencies, reducible and
non-reducible systems are mixed like Diophantine and Li-
ouvillean numbers: most systems are reducible but non-
reducible ones are dense [34, 35, 53, 54]. Morover, the
generalized Floquet decomposition of the time-evolution
operator in Eq. (2) can be found with any given accuracy,
for |ω|−1 suﬃciently small, provided it exists [55–57]. In
practice, this is often done through an expansion in terms
of powers of |ω|−1.

In this section, we will derive a generalization of the
Floquet-Magnus expansion [45, 58, 59] to quasi-periodic
systems and provide a perturbative exponential expan-
sion of the time-evolution operator with the desired Flo-
quet representation. This will allow us to identify HQ as
the eﬀective Hamiltonian that captures the dynamics of
the system in a suitable fast-driving regime.

We start the derivation by reproducing the steps of the
regular Floquet-Magnus expansion [45] and introducing
the desired decomposition of the time-evolution operator

U (t) = U

(32)

into the Schr¨odinger equation i∂tU (t) = H(t)U (t), which
yields the diﬀerential equation
†
Q(t) − U

†
Q(t) = H(t)U

†
Q(t)HQ.

(33)

Then, we deﬁne the quasi-periodic Hermitian operator
Q(t) as the generator of the quasi-periodic unitary UQ(t)
via the relation

UQ(t) = eiQ(t).

(34)

(33)
Introducing the expression in Eq.
and using a power series expansion for the diﬀerential of
the exponential [45, 59, 60], one obtains the non-linear
diﬀerential equation [45]

An important feature of the diﬀerential equation in
Eq. (38) is the structure of the operator A(n)(t), which
only contains terms involving the Hamiltonian H(t) or
operators Q(m)(t) and H (m)
Q of a lower order, i.e. with
m < n. This allows to solve Eq. (38) by just integrating
the right hand side of the equation, which leads to

Q(n)(t) =

Moreover, even though Eq. (38) describes a diﬀerential
equation for Q(n)(t), the solutions for both Q(n)(t) and
H (n)
Q can be inferred from it by imposing suitable condi-
tions on the time dependence of Q(n)(t). In the periodic
case, for example, the operators H (n)
Q are ﬁxed by the
requirement that Q(n)(t) is a periodic operator [45].
In the quasi-periodic case, we can determine H (n)

Q by
exploiting the quasi-periodicity of Q(n)(t) and A(n)(t).
(cid:80)
This essentially results from the fact that,
in order
for the integral of a quasi-periodic operator O(t) =
n Onein·ωt to be quasi-periodic, it must satisfy that
O0 = limT→∞ 1
0 O(t)dt = 0. As a consequence, in

Eqs. (42) and (43) can be solved for any n > 1 provided
that the solutions for m < n are known. Since they can
be readily solved for n = 1, Eqs.
(42) and (43) thus
contain the necessary information to recursively derive
all the terms in the expansions of Q(t) and HQ in Eqs.
(36) and (37), respectively.

Consistently with the periodic case, the results obtained
here reduce to the regular Floquet-Magnus expansion
when the frequency vector ω contains only one element.
Moreover, by using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ for-
mula [61], one can verify that the expressions in Eqs.
(44)-(47) coincide with the ﬁrst terms of the regular
Magnus expansion [59], which applies for general time-
dependent systems. This formal expansion can also be
linked [62] to the method of averaging for quasi-periodic
systems [55] to obtain exponentially small error estimates
in the quasi-periodic case.

The expansion of the operators HQ and Q(t) intro-
duced in Eqs. (36) and (37) can be interpreted as a se-
ries expansion in powers of |ω|−1 such that, in a suitable
fast-driving regime, the lowest-order terms of the series
are the most relevant to describe the dynamics of the sys-
tem. Even though the convergence of the quasi-periodic
Floquet-Magnus expansion is in general not guaranteed
and requires further investigations, this permits us to
identify eﬀective Hamiltonian analogously as done for pe-
riodic systmes.

In fast-driving regimes where the fundamental driving
frequencies are the largest energy scales of the system,
the two unitaries UQ(t) and e−iHQt of the time-evolution
operator in Eq. (32) capture two disctinct behaviours of
the system’s dynamics. On the one hand, the unitary
UQ(t) describes fast quasi-periodic ﬂuctuations dictated
by the fast frequencies ω. On the other hand, the oper-
ator e−iHQt captures the slower dynamics of the system
characterized by the internal energy scales of HQ, which
can be thus identiﬁed as the eﬀective Hamiltonian of the
system.

(48)

In this section, we will

illustrate with a quasi-
periodically driven Lambda system the possibility to ap-
proximate the dynamics of quasi-periodically driven sys-
tems in terms of a truncation of the eﬀective Hamiltonian
HQ.
The Lambda system describes an atomic three energy-
level system with two ground states |1(cid:105) and |2(cid:105) that are
coupled to an excited state |3(cid:105) via a time-dependent laser
ﬁeld. The time-dependent coupling allows one to indi-
rectly mediate a transition between the states |1(cid:105) and |2(cid:105)
without signiﬁcantly populating the excited state and,
in this way, overcome the impossibility to drive a di-
rect transition between the two degenerate ground states.
This method also permits the implementation of non-
trivial phases in the tunneling rate of particles [63, 64]
and constitutes a building block in many quantum sim-
ulations [13, 16, 20, 65].

The Hamiltonian of the Lambda system in an interac-

where f (t) is usually a periodic function but, here, we
consider it to be quasi-periodic; i.e. of the form

f (t) =

fnein·ωt,

(49)

(cid:88)

n

with a frequency vector ω and Fourier components fn.
Moreover, we require the static Fourier component to
vanish, i.e. f0 = 0, in order to ensure that the dominant
dynamics of the system do not yield transitions between
the ground states and the excited state.

With the Hamiltonian of the quasi-periodically driven
Lambda system in Eq. (48), the ﬁrst two terms of the
eﬀective Hamiltonian expansion in Eqs.
(44) and (45)
become H (1)

Q = 0 and
Q = Ωeﬀ ((|1(cid:105) + |2(cid:105))((cid:104)1| + (cid:104)2|) − 2|3(cid:105)(cid:104)3|) ,

respectively. As the ﬁrst term vanishes, the leading order
term of the eﬀective Hamiltonian is thus given by H (2)
Q ,
which describes transitions between the ground states of
the system with a rate

In order to illustrate the possibility to approximate the
dynamics of the system in terms of a truncation of HQ,

the system U (t) and the eﬀective time-evolution operator

12 (t) = |(cid:104)1|Ueﬀ (t)|2(cid:105)|2, which describe the exact
and P eﬀ
and eﬀective transitions between the ground states of the
Lambda system.

In Fig. 1, we compare the performance of the driven
Lambda system for a periodic and quasi-periodic driving
functions in a moderately fast driving regime. In Fig. 1
(a), a periodic driving is considered, which yields exact
dynamics that exhibit fast regular ﬂuctuations around
the slower eﬀective dynamics. On the contrary, we show
in Fig. 1 (b) how a quasi-periodic driving leads to a
pattern with seemingly erratic ﬂuctuation around the ef-
fective dynamics. In the regime where the ﬂuctuations
can be neglected, however, their regularity is irrelevant.
This supports the view that, since quasi-periodic func-
tions provide a more general parametrization of the driv-
ing protocol, quasi-periodically driven quantum systems
have the potential to expand the accessible eﬀective dy-
namics in a variety of experimental setups [66].

Another aspect that is apparent from Fig. 1 is the
drift between the exact and eﬀective dynamics. This is
not a characteristic feature of quasi-periodically driven
systems but rather results from the truncation of the op-
erator HQ. Including higher order terms in the expansion
of HQ or considering a faster driving regime, the approx-
imation would be improved and the exact and eﬀective
dynamics of the system would better overlap for longer
times.
Indeed, in Fig. 2 we consider a quasi-periodic
function with higher frequencies and observe that the
eﬀective time-evolution operator in Eq.
(52) approxi-
mates better the exact dynamics of the system for longer
times. This highlights the possibility to use the gener-
alized Floquet-Magnus expansion derived in Sec. V in
order to derive time-independent eﬀective Hamiltonians
that capture well the dynamics of quasi-periodic systems
in a suitable fast-driving regime.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Despite concerted eﬀorts towards generalisation of Flo-
quet’s theorem for quasi-periodic systems, there are still
many open questions regarding the existence of Floquet-
like decompositions. Although a rigorous footing is not
complete, eﬀective Hamiltonians can be constructed for
weakly and/or rapidly driven quantum systems.

Since the restriction to periodic driving naturally im-
poses restrictions on the eﬀective Hamiltonians that can
be achieved, the use of quasi-periodic Hamiltonians is
a promising route for quantum simulations. The in-
creased freedom in accessible time-dependencies makes
quasi-periodic driving a highly interesting basis for the
identiﬁcation of accurate implementations of eﬀective dy-
namics by means of optimal control. As such, one can ex-
pect that quasi-periodic driving will ﬁnd increased appli-
cation in quantum simulations, and that the increased in-
terest in quantum physics will trigger activities in math-
ematics towards the existence of Floquet-like decompo-
sitions and the convergence of perturbative expansions.

i=1 niNi with unknowns
ni can be solved if and only if the greatest common di-
visor gcd(N1,··· , Nd) divides n [? ]. Thus, by appropri-
ately choosing the variable p, the Diophantine equation
in Eq. (19) can always be solved.
[52] Similarly to the operator HF introduced in Eq. (4), the
eigenvalues of HQ are only deﬁned up n· ω, with a vector
of integers n and the frequency vector ω of the Hamilto-
nian H(t).

[46] The periodic unitary UP (t) and the Hamiltonian HF are,
however, not uniquely deﬁned. In particular, the eigen-
values of HF are only deﬁned up to multiples of ω.

II, which diﬀers from the one used in [27]. In particu-
