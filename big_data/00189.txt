Abstract

We report on results of Kra´skiewicz, the author, and Watanabe
on KP modules materializing Schubert polynomials, and ﬁltrations
having KP modules as their subquotients. We discuss applications
of KP ﬁltrations and ample KP bundles to positivity.

Introduction

In the present article, we survey a recent chapter of representation theory
of U (b)-modules: the theory of KP modules.

There is a really famous family of U (b)-modules: these are Demazure
modules ([7], [8], [14], [2], [15]). They are given by the spaces of sections
of line bundles on the Schubert varieties in ﬂag manifolds.
Invented in
the 1970s by Demazure, the theory was developed in the 1980s by Joseph,
Andersen, Polo, Mathieu, van der Kallen et al.

The origins of KP modules, though also related to Schubert varieties,
are diﬀerent. In the beginning of 1980s, Lascoux and Sch¨utzenberger [20]
discovered Schubert polynomials – certain polynomial lifts of cohomology
classes of Schubert varieties in ﬂag manifolds (see [3]). Schubert polynomials
are described in Sect. 3.
It was a conjecture of Lascoux (Oberwolfach,
June 1983) that there should exist a functorial version of this construction
(similarly as to Schur functions there correspond Schur functors, cf. Sect. 2).
The Lascoux conjecture was solved aﬃrmatively by Kra´skiewicz and the
author [16, 17]. The so-obtained modules were called Kra´skiewicz-Pragacz
modules, in short KP modules by Watanabe, who is the author of further

developments of the theory of KP modules and KP ﬁltrations in the spirit
of the highest weight categories [5]. His work [32, 33, 34] is surveyed in
Sect. 5. The KP modules and related modules, e.g. Schur ﬂagged modules,
are discussed in Sect. 4.

The setting of the last two sections can be explained in the following
way. We write the Schur polynomial applied to a KP bundle as a linear
combination of Schubert polynomials. The two approaches: the ﬁrst by
Watanabe via KP ﬁltrations, and the second by Fulton via ample vector
bundles show that the coeﬃcients are nonnegative.

Perhaps a couple of words about comparison of Demazure and KP mod-
ules is in order. KP modules are in some way similar to Demazure modules
(of type (A)), the modules generated by an extremal vector in an irreducible
representation of gln: they are both cyclic U (b)-modules parametrized by
the weights of the generators, and if the permutation is vexillary, then the
KP module coincides with Demazure module with the same weight of the
generator. If a permutation is not vexillary, then there exists a strict sur-
jection from the KP module to the Demazure module of the corresponding
lowest weight.

This article is a written account of the talk given by the author during
the conference “IMPANGA 15” at the Banach Center in B¸edlewo in April
2015.

2 Schur functors

Throughout this paper, let K be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero.

In his dissertation [29] (Berlin, 1901), Schur gave a classiﬁcation of ir-
reducible polynomial representations of the full linear group GLn(K), i.e.
homomorphisms

GLn(K) → GLN (K)

sending an n × n-matrix X to an N × N -matrix [Pij(X)], where Pij is a
polynomial in the entries of X. Let Σn denotes the symmetric group of all
bijections of {1, . . . , n}. Consider the following two actions on E⊗n, where
E is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over K:

• of the symmetric group Σn via permutations of the factors;
• the diagonal action of GL(E).
Irreductible representations Sλ of the symmetric group Σn are labeled

by partitions of n, see, e.g. [4]. By a partition of n, we mean a sequence

λ = (λ1 ≥ ··· ≥ λk ≥ 0)

of integers such that |λ| = λ1 +··· + λk = n. A partition is often represented
graphically by its diagram with λi boxes in the ith row (cf. [24]).

2

Example 1 The diagram of the partition (8, 7, 4, 2) is

Let R be a commutative ring at let E be an R-module. We deﬁne the Schur
module associated with a partition λ as follows:

Vλ(E) := HomZ[Σn](Sλ, E⊗n) ,

In fact, Vλ(−) is a functor:

where Z[Σn] denotes the group ring of Σn with integer coeﬃcients (cf. [27]).
if E, F are R-modules over a commuta-
tive ring R, and f : E → F is an R-homomorphism, then f induces an
R-homomorphism Vλ(E) → Vλ(F ). In this way, we get all irreducible poly-
nomial representations of GLn(K).

Let us label the boxes of the diagram of a partition of n with numbers
1, . . . , n, and call such an object a tableau. For example, a tableau for the
diagram of the partition (8, 7, 4, 2) is

Consider the following two elements in Z[Σn] associated with a tableau:
• P := sum of w ∈ Σn preserving the rows of the tableau ;
• N := sum of w ∈ Σn with their signs, preserving the columns of the

tableau .

The following element

e(λ) := N ◦ P

is an idempotent in Z[Σn], called the Young idempotent. For more on Young
idempotents, see [4]. We have an alternative presentation of Schur module:

Vλ(E) = e(λ)E⊗n .

There is still another way of getting Schur modules Vλ(E) (see [18], [1])
as the images of natural homomorphisms between the tensor products of
symmetric and exterior powers of a module:

Sλ1(E) ⊗ ··· ⊗ Sλk (E) → E⊗|λ| → ∧µ1(E) ⊗ ··· ⊗ ∧µl(E)

(1)

3

(here µ = λ∼ is the conjugate partition of λ, see [23]), the ﬁrst map is
the diagonalization in the symmetric algebra, and the second map is the
multiplication in the exterior algebra); and

∧µ1(E) ⊗ ··· ⊗ ∧µl(E) → E⊗|λ| → Sλ1(E) ⊗ ··· ⊗ Sλk (E)

(here the ﬁrst map is the diagonalization in the exterior algebra, and the
second map is multiplication in the symmetric algebra).
Example 2 We have V(n)(E) = Sn(E) and V(1n)(E) = ∧n(E), the nth
symmetric and exterior power of E.

Let T be the subgroup of diagonal matrices in GLn(K):

x1

 .

Let E be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over K. Consider the action of
T on the Schur module Vλ(E) associated with a partition λ = (λ1, . . . , λk),
induced from the action of GLn(K) via restriction.

Theorem 3 (Main result of Schur’s Thesis) The trace of the action of T
on Vλ(E) is equal to the Schur function:

sλ(x) = det(cid:0)sλp−p+q(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:1)

1≤p,q≤k ,

where si(x1, . . . , xn), i ∈ Z, is the complete symmetric function of degree i
if i ≥ 0, and zero otherwise.

For more on Schur functions, see [24], [19].

Among the most important formulas in the theory of symmetric func-

tions, they are the following Cauchy formulas:

(1 − xiyj)−1 =

sλ(x)sλ(y)

(cid:89)
(cid:89)

i,j

(cid:88)
(cid:88)

λ

and

(1 + xiyj) =

sλ(x)sλ∼(y) .

i,j

λ

Schur functors were brought to the attention of algebraists in [18] together
with the materializations1 of the Cauchy formulas: for free R-modules E, F
one has:

Sn(E ⊗ F ) = ⊕|λ|=nVλ(E) ⊗ Vλ(F ) ,

1We say that a formula on the level of representations “materializes” a polynomial

formula if the latter is the character of the former.

4

and

∧n(E ⊗ F ) = ⊕|λ|=nVλ(E) ⊗ Vλ∼(F ) .

Whereas the former formula gives the irreducible GL(E)×GL(F )-representa-
tions of the decomposition of the space of functions on the space of dim(E)×
dim(F )-matrices, the importance of the latter comes from the fact that it de-
scribes the Koszul syzygies of the ideal generated by the entries of a generic
dim(E) × dim(F )-matrix. Then, using suitable derived functors (following
a method introduced in Kempf’s 1971 Thesis), this allows one to describe
syzygies of determinantal ideals [18]. In fact, there is a natural extension of
Schur functors to Schur complexes with many applications (see [27], [1]).

3 Schubert polynomials

In the present article, by a permutation w = w(1), w(2), . . ., we shall mean
a bijection N → N, which is the identity oﬀ a ﬁnite set. The group of
permutations will be denoted by Σ∞. The symmetric group Σn is identiﬁed
with the subgroup of Σ∞ consisting of permutations w such that w(i) = i
for i > n. We set

We deﬁne a linear operator ∂i : A → A as follows:

A := Z[x1, x2, . . .] .

∂i(f ) :=

f (x1, . . . , xi, xi+1, . . .) − f (x1, . . . , xi+1, xi, . . .)

xi − xi+1

.

These are classical Newton’s divided diﬀerences. For more on divided dif-
ferences, see [20], [21], [23], [19].
For a simple reﬂection si = 1, . . . , i− 1, i + 1, i, i + 2, . . ., we put ∂si := ∂i.
Lemma 4 Suppose that w = s1 ··· sk = t1 ··· tk are two reduced words for
a permutation w. Then we have ∂s1 ◦ ··· ◦ ∂sk = ∂t1 ◦ ··· ◦ ∂tk .

(See [3] and [6].)

of a reduced word of w.

Thus for any w ∈ Σ∞, we can deﬁne ∂w as ∂s1 ◦ ··· ◦ ∂sk independently
Let w ∈ S∞ and let n be a natural number such that w(k) = k for
k > n. We deﬁne the Schubert polynomial of Lascoux and Sch¨utzenberger
[20] (1982) associated with a permutation w, by setting

Sw := ∂w−1w0(xn−1

1 xn−2

··· x1

where w0 is the permutation (n, n − 1, . . . , 2, 1), n + 1, n + 2, . . .. Observe
that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of n, because

In the above picture of Schubert polynomials for the symmetric group Σ4,
we have: a = x1, b = x2, c = x3; to a permutation there is attached its
Schubert polynomial; the line ∼∼∼ means ∂1, the line ––– means ∂2, and
the line − − − means ∂3. (The author got this picture from Lascoux in
February 1982 together with a preliminary version of [20].)

Also, we deﬁne the kth inversion set of a permutation w as follows:

Ik(w) := {l : l > k, w(k) > w(l)}

k = 1, 2, . . . .

By the code of w (notation: c(w)), we shall mean the sequence (i1, i2, . . .),
where ik = |Ik(w)|, k = 1, 2, . . .. A code determines the corresponding
permutation in a unique way.

Example 5 The code c(4, 2, 1, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8, . . .) is equal to (3, 1, 0, 2, 0, . . .).

Let us mention the following properties of Schubert polynomials:
• A Schubert polynomial Sw is symmetric in xk i xk+1 if and only if

w(k) < w(k + 1) (or equivalently if ik ≤ ik+1);

• If w(1) < w(2) < ··· < w(k) > w(k + 1) < w(k + 2) < ··· (or
equivalently i1 ≤ i2 ≤ ··· ≤ ik, 0 = ik+1 = ik+2 = ··· ), then Sw is
equal to the Schur function sik,...,i2,i1(x1, . . . , xk).

• If i1 ≥ i2 ≥ ···

, then Sw = xi1

2 ···

1 xi2

is a monomial.

Example 6 The Schubert polynomials of degree 1 are Ssi = x1 + ··· + xi,
i = 1, 2. . . ..

For these and more properties of Schubert polynomials, the reader may

consult [23] and [19].

Note that the Schubert polynomials indexed by Σn do not generate ad-

ditively Z[x1, . . . , xn]. We have (see [23])

ZSw =

(cid:77)

If the sets Ik(w) form a chain (with respect to the inclusion), then the
permutation w is called vexillary. Equivalently, there are no i < j < k < l
with w(j) < w(i) < w(l) < w(k) (see e.g. [23]).

The following result stems from [20] and [31]:

Theorem 7 (Lascoux-Sch¨utzenberger, Wachs) If w is a vexillary permuta-
tion with code (i1, i2, . . . , in > 0, 0 . . .), then

≤
Sw = s(i1,...,in)≥ (min I1(w) − 1, . . . , min In(w) − 1)

.

(By (−)≥ and (−)≤, we mean the respectively ordered sets.)

Here, for two sequences of natural numbers

i1 ≥ ··· ≥ ik

si1,...,ik (b1, . . . , bk) := det(cid:0)sip−p+q(x1, . . . , xbp)(cid:1)

and 0 < b1 ≤ ··· ≤ bk ,

1≤p,q≤k

is a ﬂagged Schur function (see [23]).

4 Functors asked by Lascoux
Let R be a commutative Q-algebra, and E• : E1 ⊂ E2 ⊂ ··· a ﬂag of R-
modules. Suppose that I = [ik,l], k, l = 1, 2, . . ., is a matrix of 0’s and 1’s
such that

• ik,l = 0 for k ≥ l;

• (cid:80)

l ik,l is ﬁnite for any k;

• I has a ﬁnite number of nonzero rows.
Such a matrix I is called a shape:

where ∆S is the diagonalization in the symmetric algebra and m∧ is the

For example, if all the 1’s occur in I only in the kth row, then we get
Sp(Ek), where p is the number of 1’s. Also, if all the 1’s occur in I in one
column in consecutive p rows, then we get ∧p(Ek), where k is the number
of the lowest row with 1.

Let w ∈ Σ∞. By the shape of w we mean the matrix:

where χk is the characteristic function of Ik(w).

We deﬁne a module Sw(E•), associated with a permutation w and a ﬂag
E• as SIw (E•); this leads to a functor Sw(−). These modules were deﬁned
by Kra´skiewicz and the author in [16] and [17].

Example 9 Invoking the previous example, we see that S42163578...(E•) is
the image of the map

ΦI42163578... : S3(E1) ⊗ S1(E2) ⊗ S2(E4) → E1 ⊗ ∧2(E2) ⊗ ∧2(E4) ⊗ E5 .

From now on, let E• be a ﬂag of K-vector spaces with dim Ei = i . Let

B be the Borel group of linear endomorphisms of E :=(cid:83) Ei, which preserve
cyclic Z[B]-submodule in(cid:78)

E•. The modules used in the deﬁnition of SI(E•) are Z[B]-modules, and
the maps are homomorphisms of Z[B]-modules. Let {ui : i = 1, 2, . . .} be a
basis of E such that u1, u2, . . . , uk span Ek. Then the module SI(E•) as a

(cid:86)(cid:101)il El, is generated by the element

l

uI := ⊗luk1,l ∧ uk2,l ∧ ··· ∧ ukil,l ,

where k1,l < k2,l < ··· < kil,l are precisely those indices for which ikr,l,l = 1.
In particular, Sw(E•) is a cyclic Z[B]-module generated by uw = uIw . The
modules Sw(E•) were called by Watanabe Kra´skiewicz-Pragacz modules, in
short KP modules (see [32, v3], [33], [34]).
Example 10 The KP module S52163478...(E•) is generated over Z[B] by the
element

u42163578... = u1 ⊗ u1 ∧ u2 ⊗ u1 ∧ u4 ⊗ u4 .

KP modules give a substantial generalization of Schur modules discussed
in Sect. 2. Note that any Schur module Vλ(Em), where λ = (λ1, . . . , λk > 0)
and k ≤ m, can be realized as Sw(E•) for some w. We claim that the
permutation w with the code (0m−k, λk, . . . , λ1, 0, . . .) determines the desired

KP module. Take for example m = 4, λ = (4, 3, 1). The permutation with
the code (0, 1, 3, 4, 0, . . .) is 1, 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, . . ., and has shape

Its KP module is given by the image of the map
ΦI136824579,... : E2 ⊗ S3(E3) ⊗ Sr(E4) → ∧3(E4) ⊗ ∧2(E4) ⊗ ∧2(E4) ⊗ E4 .

We invoke at this point a standard basis theorem for Schur modules (see [1],
[30]), which allows us to replace the ﬂag E1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Em by Em = ··· = Em
without change of the image of ΦIw . We obtain that the image of ΦI136824579,...
is equal to the image of the map (1)

E4 ⊗ S3(E4) ⊗ Sr(E4) → ∧3(E4) ⊗ ∧2(E4) ⊗ ∧2(E4) ⊗ E4,

deﬁning V(4,3,1)(E4).
We shall now study the character of Sw(E•). Consider the maximal torus
(2) T ⊂ B consisting of diagonal matrices with x1, x2, . . . on the diagonal,
with respect to the basis {ui : i = 1, 2, . . .}.
Theorem 11 (Kra´skiewicz-Pragacz) Let w ∈ Σ∞. The trace of the action
of T on Sw(E•) is equal to the Schubert polynomial Sw.

About the proof: we study the multiplicative properties of Sw(E•)’s, com-
paring them with those of the Sw’s.

Let tp,q be the permutation:

1, . . . , p − 1, q, p + 1, . . . , q − 1, p, q + 1, ... .

We now record the following formula for multiplication by Ssk :

Theorem 12 (Monk) Let w ∈ Σ∞. We have

(cid:88)

Sw · (x1 + ··· + xk) =

Sw◦tp,q ,

where the sum is over p, q such that p ≤ k, q > k and l(w ◦ tp,q) = l(w) + 1.

(See [26], [21], [23].)

10

Example 13 We have

S135246... · (x1 + x2) = S235146... + S153246... + S145236... .

In fact, we shall use more eﬃciently the following result of Lascoux and

Sch¨utzenberger (see [22]).
Theorem 14 (Transition formula) Let w ∈ Σ∞. Suppose that (j, s) is a
pair of positive integers such that
1) j < s and w(j) > w(s),
2) for any i ∈]j, s[, w(i) /∈ [w(s), w(j)]
3) for any r > j, if w(s) < w(r) then there exists i ∈]j, r[ such that w(i) ∈
[w(s), w(r)].

Then

Sw = Sv · xj +

p=1

where v = w ◦ tj,s, vp = w ◦ tj,s ◦ tkp,j , p = 1, . . . , m, say. Here the numbers
kp are such that
4) kp < j and w(kp) < w(s),
5) if i ∈]kp, j[ then w(i) /∈ [w(kp), w(s)].

Note that if (j, s) is the maximal pair (in the lexicographical order) satisfying
1), then conditions 2)-3) are also fulﬁlled. A transition corresponding to this
pair will be called maximal. In particular, for any nonntrivial permutation,
there is at least one transition.

Example 15 For the permutation 521863479 . . .,

S521843679... · x5 + S524813679... + S541823679...

is the maximal transition, and other transitions are

S521763489... · x4 + S527163489... + S571263489... + S721563489...

and

S512864379... · x2 .

We prove that for the maximal transition for w, there exists a ﬁltration

of Z[B]-modules

0 = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Fm ⊂ F = Sw(E•)

together with isomorphisms

F/Fm (cid:39) Sv(E•) ⊗ Ej/Ej−1

and

Fp/Fp−1 (cid:39) Svp(E•)

11

where p = 1, . . . , m. This implies an isomorphism of T -modules

Sw(E•) (cid:39) Sv(E•) ⊗ Ej/Ej−1 ⊕ m(cid:77)

Svp(E•) .

p=1

By comparing this with the transition formula for Schubert polynomials, the
assertion of Theorem 11 follows by a suitable induction. 2
(For details see [17, Sect. 4].)

There exist ﬂagged Schur modules Sλ(−), associated with suitable shapes
(see [17, p. 1330]). Suppose that E• is a ﬂag of free R-modules with E1 = R
and such that the ith inclusion in the ﬂag is given by Ei (cid:44)→ Ei ⊕ R (cid:39) Ei+1.
We record

Theorem 16 (Kra´skiewicz-Pragacz) If w is a vexillary permutation with
code (i1, i2, . . . , in > 0, 0 . . .), then

Sw(E•) = S(i1,...,in)≥(cid:0)Emin I1(w)−1, . . . , Emin In(w)−1

5 KP ﬁltrations of weight modules

All the results of this section (with just a few exceptions) are due to Watan-
abe in [32] and [33]. In [32], the author studied the structure of KP modules
using the theory of highest weight categories [5]. From the results in [32],
in particular, one obtains a certain highest weight category whose standard
modules are KP modules. In [33], the author investigated the tensor multi-
plication properties of KP modules.

In this section, we shall use the language and techniques of enveloping

diagonal matrices, and U (b) the enveloping algebra of b. Suppose that M

the weight space of λ, (cid:104)λ, h(cid:105) = (cid:80) λihi. If M is a direct sum of its weight

spaces and each weight space has ﬁnite dimension, then M is called a weight
module. For a weight module, we set

Let Kλ be a one-dimensional U (b)-module, where h acts by (cid:104)λ, h(cid:105) and
the matrices eij, where i < j, acts by zero. Any ﬁnite-dimensional weight
module admits a ﬁltration by these one-dimensional modules.
Fix n ∈ N. In this section, we shall mainly work with permutations from

Σ(n) := {w : w(n + 1) < w(n + 2) < ...} .

Observe that the codes of permutations in Σ(n) are in Zn≥0; in fact, they

exhaust Zn≥0. Moreover, we have(cid:88)

ZSw = Z[x1, . . . , xn] .

w∈Σ(n)

Write E = ⊕1≤i≤nKui. For each j ∈ N, let lj = lj(w) be the cardinality

{i < j : w(i) > w(j)} = {i1 < . . . < ilj} ,

of the set

and write

w = ui1 ∧ ··· ∧ uilj
u(j)
w ⊗ ··· and Sw = U (b)uw. The weight of uw is c(w).

∈ Λlj (E) .

We have uw = u1
Observe that Theorem 11 can be restated as
Theorem 17 For any w ∈ Σ(n), Sw is a weight module and ch(Sw) = Sw.

w ⊗ u2

A natural question arises: What is the annihilator of uw?
Let w ∈ Σ(n). Consider the following assignment:
(1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) −→ mij(w) = #{k > j : w(i) < w(k) < w(j)} .

annihilates uw. Let Iw ⊂ U (b) be the ideal generated by

, i < j. Then there exists a surjection

U (b)/Iw (cid:16) Sw

such that 1 mod Iw (cid:55)→ uw.

Theorem 18 (Watanabe) This surjection is an isomorphism.

(See [32], Sect. 4.)

For α, β ∈ Zn, we shall write α ± β for (α1 ± β1, . . . , αn ± βn).
For λ ∈ Zn≥0, we set Sλ := Sw, where c(w) = λ. For λ ∈ Zn take k such
that λ + k1 ∈ Zn≥0 (1 = (1, . . . , 1) n times), and set Sλ = K−k1 ⊗ Sλ+k1. We
shall use a similar notation for Schubert polynomials.

A KP ﬁtration of a weight module is a sequence
0 = M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Mr = M

of weight modules such that each subquotient Mi/Mi−1 is isomorphic to
some KP module.

One can ask the following questions:

1. When a weight module admits a KP ﬁltration?
2. Does Sλ ⊗ Sµ have a KP ﬁltration?

Write ρ = (n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 1, 0). The module Kρ will play a role of a
“dualizing module”.
Let C denote the category of all weight modules. For Λ ⊂ Zn, let CΛ be
the full subcategory of C consisting of all weight modules whose weights are
in Λ. If |Λ| < ∞ and Λ(cid:48) = {ρ − λ : λ ∈ Λ}, then the map M (cid:55)→ M∗ ⊗ Kρ
yields an isomorphism CΛ(cid:48) ∼= Cop
Λ .
Lemma 19 For any Λ ⊂ Zn, CΛ has enough projectives.

(See [32, Sect. 6].)

For λ ∈ Zn, deﬁne |λ| = (cid:80) λi. If λ = c(w), µ = c(v), we write λ ≥ µ

We now deﬁne some useful orders on Σ∞. For w, v ∈ Σ∞, w ≤lex v if
w = v or there exists i > 0 such that w(j) = v(j) for j < i and w(i) < v(i).
if |λ| = |µ| and w−1 ≤lex v−1. For general λ, µ ∈ Zn take k such that
λ + k1, µ + k1 ∈ Zn≥0, and deﬁne λ ≥ µ iﬀ λ + k1 ≥ µ + k1.

For λ ∈ Zn, set C≤λ := C{ν:ν≤λ}.

Proposition 20 For λ ∈ Zn, the modules Sλ and S∗
ρ−λ ⊗ Kρ is injective.
Moreover, Sλ is projective and S∗

ρ−λ ⊗ Kρ are in C≤λ.

(See [32, Sect. 6].)

For the deﬁnitions and properties of Ext’s, we refer to [25]. All Ext’s

will be taken over U (b), in C≤λ.
Theorem 21 (Watanabe) For µ, ν ≤ λ, Exti(Sµ, S∗

ρ−ν ⊗ Kρ) = 0 if i ≥ 1.

(See [32, Sect. 7]. This can be regarded a “Strong form of Polo’s theorem”
[15, Theorem 3.2.2].)
Theorem 22 (Watanabe) Let M ∈ C≤λ. If Ext1(M, S∗
ρ−µ ⊗ Kρ) = 0 for
all µ ≤ λ, then M has a KP ﬁltration such that each of its subquotients is
isomorphic to some Sν with ν ≤ λ.

(See [32, Sect. 8] and also [33, Theorem 2.5].)

14

Corollary 23 (1) If M = M1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Mr, then M has a KP ﬁltration iﬀ
each Mi does.
(2) If 0 → L → M → N → 0 is exact and M, N have KP ﬁltrations,

then L also does.
Proof. Assertion (1) follows from Ext1(M, N ) = ⊕ Ext1(Mi, N ) for any N .

Assertion (2) follows from the exactness of the sequence
Ext1(M, A) → Ext1(L, A) → Ext2(N, A)

for any A. 2
Proposition 24 Let w ∈ Σ(n), 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Then Sw ⊗ Ssk has a KP
ﬁltration.

This result was established in [17, Sect. 5] for k = 1 and in ([33, Sect. 3])
in general.
Theorem 25 (Watanabe) Sw ⊗ Sv has a KP ﬁltration for any w, v ∈ Σ(n).

In order to outline a proof, set li = li(w) and consider an U (b)-module

Tw = ⊗2≤i≤n(ΛliKi−1) .

The module Tw is a direct sum component of

⊗2≤i≤n

(cid:0)Ssi−1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Ssi−1

(cid:1) ,

where Ssi−1 appears li times.
Proposition 26 Suppose that w ∈ Σn. Then there is an exact sequence

0 → Sw → Tw → N → 0 ,

where N has a ﬁltration whose subquotients are Su with u−1 >lex w−1.

Granting this proposition, a proof of the theorem consists of considering

the following exact sequence of U (b)-modules

0 → Sw ⊗ Sv → Tw ⊗ Sv → N ⊗ Sv → 0 .

Here, the middle module has a KP ﬁltration by the proposition and the
module on the right one by induction on lex(w). Consequently the module
on the left has a KP ﬁltration by Corollary 23. 2
To show the proposition, we need the following

15

Lemma 27 (i) If the coeﬃcient of xc(v) in Sw is nonzero, then we have
v−1 ≥lex w−1.
(ii) If Ext1(Sw, Su) (cid:54)= (0), then u−1 <lex w−1.

(See [32, Sect. 6].)

We come back to the proposition. Deﬁne the integers mwu by

mwuSu =

eli(x1, . . . , xi−1) ,

(cid:88)

u∈Σn

(cid:89)

i+j≤n

(cid:89)

2≤i≤n

(cid:88)

w∈Σn

where ek denotes the elementary symmetric function of degree k. Thus mwu
is the number of times Su appears as a subquotient of any KP ﬁltration of
Tw. Let us invoke the following Cauchy-type formula:

(xi + yj) =

Sw(x)Sww0(y)

(see [23], [19]). Consider the bilinear form (cid:104),(cid:105) on the free abelian group
generated by Schubert polynomials Sw, where w ∈ Σn, corresponding to
this Cauchy identity, i.e., such that (cid:104)Su, Su(cid:48)w0(cid:105) = δuu(cid:48) for any u, u(cid:48) ∈ Σn.
We have

mwu = (cid:104)Suw0,

eli(x1, . . . , xi−1)(cid:105) .

(cid:89)

2≤i≤n

We use now an additional property of the bilinear form: for any α, β ∈ Zn≥0
with αi, βi ≤ n − i,

(cid:89)

1≤i≤n−1

(cid:104)xρ−α,

eβi(x1, . . . , xn−i)(cid:105) = δα,β .

Using these two mutually orthogonal bases of monomials and products of
elementary symmetric functions, we infer that mwu is the coeﬃcient of
xn−1−ln
in Suw0. From this description, is not hard to see
that for any k,
n − k − ln+1−k = c(ww0)k ,

xn−2−ln−1

···

1

2

and thus the number mwu is equal to the coeﬃcient of xc(ww0) in Suw0. By
Lemma 27(i), this coeﬃcient is nonzero only if
u−1 ≥lex w−1 .

If u = w, then mwu = 1; thus the subquotients of any KP ﬁltration of Tw
are the KP modules Su, where u−1 >lex w−1, together with Sw which occurs
just once. Since, by Lemma 27(ii), Ext1(Sw, Su) = 0 if u−1 >lex w−1, one
can take a ﬁltration such that Sw occurs as a submodule of Tw. 2

One can say that the proposition gives a materialization of the above

mentioned Cauchy-type formula for Schubert polynomials.

16

ch(M ) ≤(cid:88)

Theorem 28 (Watanabe) Let λ ∈ Zn and M ∈ C≤λ. Then we have

dimK(HomU (b)(M, Sρ−ν ⊗ Kρ))Sν .

(Here(cid:80) aαxα ≤(cid:80) bαxα means that aα ≤ bα for any α.) The equality holds

ν≤λ

if and only if M has a KP ﬁltration with all subquotients isomorphic to Sµ,
where µ ≤ λ.

(See [32, Sect. 8].)

As a byproduct, we get a formula for the coeﬃcient of Sw in SuSv:

Corollary 29 This coeﬃcient is equal to the dimension of

HomU (b)(Su ⊗ Sv, Sw0w ⊗ Kρ) = HomU (b)(Su ⊗ Sv ⊗ Swow, Kρ) .

(cid:88)

Proof. We use ch together with its multiplicativity property, and infer

SuSv = ch(Su ⊗ Sv) =

(Su ⊗ Sv, S∗

ρ−λ ⊗ Kρ)Sw . 2

6 An application of KP ﬁltrations to positivity

Let Vσ denote the Schur functor associated to a partition σ (cf. Sect. 2),
and let Sλ be the KP module associated with a sequence λ.

Proposition 30 (Watanabe) The module Vσ(Sλ) has a KP ﬁltration.
Proof. The module (Sλ)⊗k has a KP ﬁltration for any λ and any k. Hence

Ext1((Sλ)⊗k, S∗

ν ⊗ Kρ) = 0

for any ν by Theorem 22. The module Vσ(Sλ) is a direct sum factor of
(Sλ)⊗|σ|. Hence

Ext1(Vσ(Sλ), S∗

ν ⊗ Kρ) = 0

for any ν, and Vσ(Sλ) has a KP ﬁltration. 2
Corollary 31 If Sw is a sum of monomials xα + xβ +··· , then the follow-
ing specialization of a Schur function: sσ(xα, xβ, . . .) is a sum of Schubert
polynomials with nonnegative coeﬃcients.

17

7 Ample vector bundles, KP bundles and positiv-

ity

In [10, p. 632], Fulton indicated how to get the positivity in Corollary 31
using ample vector bundles and KP bundles. In fact, a proper variant of
KP bundles should be used.

A good reference for the notions of algebraic geometry needed in this

section is [13].
Recall that a vector bundle E on a variety X is ample if for any coherent
sheaf F on X and m >> 0, the sheaf Sm(E) ⊗ F is generated by its global
[12]). Given a vector bundle E, by sλ(E) (resp. Sw(E)) we
sections (cf.
shall denote sλ(α1, . . . , αn) (resp. Sw(α1, . . . , αn)), where αi are the Chern
roots of E.

We shall say that a polynomial P (c1, c2, . . .) of degree d, where the vari-
ables ci are of degree i, is numerically positive for ample vector bundles if
for any complete variety of dimension d,

P (c1(E), c2(E), . . .) ∩ [X] > 0 .

X

Note that any polynomial P (c1, c2, . . .) of degree d is a combination of Schur

polynomials (cid:80)|λ|=d aλsλ(c1, c2, . . . ). In their study of numerically positive
Theorem 32 (Fulton-Lazarsfeld) A nonzero polynomial(cid:80)|λ|=d aλsλ is nu-

polynomials for ample vector bundles, the authors of [11] showed

merically positive for ample vector bundles if and only if all the coeﬃcients
aλ are nonnegative.

(cid:90)

Schur functors give rise to Schur bundles Vλ(E) associated to vector

bundles E. In [28, Cor. 7.2], the following result was shown

In sλ(Vµ(E)) =(cid:80)

Corollary 33 (Pragacz)
aν are nonnegative.

ν aνsν(E), all the coeﬃcients

Indeed, assuming that E is ample, combining the theorem and the fact that
the Schur bundle of an ample bundle is ample (see [12]), the assertion follows.
To proceed further, we shall need a variant of KP modules associated

with sequences of surjections of modules. Suppose that

F0 = F (cid:16) F1 (cid:16) F2 (cid:16) ···

Let I = [ik,l] be a shape (see Sect. 4), ik :=(cid:80)∞

is a sequence of surjections of R-modules, where R is a commutative ring.
k=1 ik,l .
We deﬁne S(cid:48)

I(F•) as the image of the following composition:
S(cid:101)il

∧ik (Fk) ∆∧−→(cid:79)

l=1 ik,l, and(cid:101)il :=(cid:80)∞
mS−→(cid:79)

(Fl) ,

∧ik,l(Fk)

(cid:79)

(cid:79)

ΨI(F•) :

where ∆∧ is the diagonalization in the exterior algebra and mS is the mul-
tiplication in the symmetric algebra. For w ∈ Σ∞, we deﬁne S(cid:48)
w(F•) =
(F•). Suppose that R is K, and dim(Fi) = n − i for i = 0, 1, . . . n. If
S(cid:48)
Iw
w ∈ Σn, then the character of S(cid:48)

w is equal to Sw0ww0.

We now pass to ﬁltered vector bundles. By a ﬁltered bundle, we shall

mean a vector bundle E of rank n, equipped with a ﬂag of subbundles

0 = Ek ⊂ Ek−1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ E0 = E .

We shall consider polynomials that can be written in terms of the Chern
classes of the quotient bundles Ej/Ej+1. These are polynomials with some
appropriate symmetry properties. For such a polynomial P of degree d, and
a ﬁltered vector bundle E on an algebraic variety X, by substituting the
Chern roots of E for the variables x1, . . . , xn, and suitably ordering these
roots, we get a class denoted P (E•). Such a polynomial P will be called
numerically positive for ﬁltered ample vector bundles, if for any ﬁltered ample
vector bundle on any d-dimensional complete algebraic variety X,

(cid:90)

P (E•) ∩ [X] > 0 .

X

Coming back to Schubert polynomials, given any P as above, write P =

(cid:80) awSw for unique rational numbers aw. We then have (see [10])
Theorem 34 (Fulton) A nonzero polynomial P =(cid:80) awSw is numerically

positive for ﬁltered ample bundles if and only if all coeﬃcients aw are non-
negative.

w(F•). We record

If (4) is a sequence of vector bundles, then our construction gives a vector

bundle S(cid:48)
Lemma 35 If F is an ample vector bundle, then the KP bundle S(cid:48)
ample.
Proof. The bundle S(cid:48)
w(F•) is the image of the map (5), thus it is a quotient
of a tensor product of exterior powers of the bundles Fk which are quotients
of F . The assertion follows from the facts (see [12]) that a quotient of an
ample bundle is ample, an exterior power of an ample vector bundle is ample,
and the tensor product of ample bundles is ample. 2

w(F•) is

Finally, to prove the assertion in Corollary 31, we can take a sequence

(4) of vector bundles of ranks n, n − 1,... . We write

(cid:88)

sλ(S(cid:48)

w(F•)) =

avSv(F ) .

v

Then assuming that F is ample, combining the theorem and the lemma, we
see that all the coeﬃcients av are nonnegative.

We conclude with some notes.

Note 36 In a recent preprint [34], Watanabe shows that the highest weight
category from [32] is self Ringel-dual and that the tensor product operation
on U (b)-modules is compatible with Ringel duality functor. Moreover, from
the paper it follows an interesting corollary about Ext groups between KP
modules: Exti(Sw, Sv) (cid:39) Exti(Sw0vw0, Sw0ww0).

Note 37 It would be interesting to ﬁnd further applications of KP modules,
and construct analogues of KP modules for other types than (A).

Note 38 In [17, Sect. 6], the reader can ﬁnd a discussion of some further
developments related to KP modules.
