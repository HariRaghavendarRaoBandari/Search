Abstract.

In the present work, focusing on one of the most popular problems
in modern gravitation theories, we consider generalized Lanndau-Liftshitz energy-
momentum relation to calculate energy distribution of the Bianchi-Type VI spacetime
in f (R) gravity. Additionally, the results are speciﬁed by using some well-known f (R)-
gravity models.
Keywords: Bianchi; energy localization; modiﬁed gravity.

1. Introduction

Gravitational energy-momentum localization problem is one of the most popular in
gravitation theories and it still remains unsolved. Einstein is known as the ﬁrst scientist
who worked on energy-momentum pseudotensors[1] and diﬀerent energy momentum
prescriptions[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] were put forwarded after his studies. All energy-
momentum formulations except for the Møller prescription[9] were restricted to make
computations in cartesian coordinates.
In 1990, Virbhadra and his collaborators re-
opened the energy-momentum localization problem[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and after
those pioneering papers great numbers of work have been prepared[17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] by considering diﬀerent energy momentum complexes and
spacetime models.

Recently, modiﬁed gravitation theories especially f (R) gravity which extends the
general theory of relativity have also been taken into account by many scientists to
discuss gravitational puzzles again[30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,
44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. The f (R)-gravity should be deﬁned by modifying the Einstein-Hilbert
action:

S = −

2κ Z √−gf (R)d4x + Sm

where κ = 8πG, g represents the determinant of the metric tensor, f (R) denotes a
general function of Ricci scalar and Sm is the matter part of action[49]. It is known that

† E-mail: muratkorunur@yahoo.com

Localized energy associated with Bianchi-Type VI universe in f (R) theory of gravity 2

the Ricci curvature scalar is given by

R = gµνRµν ,

(2)

where Rµν is the Ricci tensor related with the Riemann tensor, i.e. Rµν = Rλ
below:

µλν, given

Rλ

µνσ = ∂νΓλ

ην − Γη

and Γλ

µσ is known as the Christoﬀel symbols:

Γλ

µσ =

2

gλβ (∂σgµβ + ∂µgσβ − ∂βgµσ) .

(3)

(4)

Now, varying equation (1) with respect to the metric tensor yields the following ﬁeld
equation

F (R)Rµν −

1
2

f (R)gµν − [∇µ∇ν − gµν∇α∇α]F (R) = κTµν.

(5)

Here, it has been deﬁned that F (R) ≡ df (R)
dR and ∇µ represents the covariant derivative.
After construction for the vacuum case, i.e. T = 0, the corresponding ﬁeld equation
transforms to the following form

F (R)R − 2f (R) + 3∇α∇αF (R) = 0.

It can be easily seen that for any constant curvature scalar equation (6) becomes

F (R0)R0 − 2f (R0) = 0,

(6)

(7)

here we have used that R = R0 = constant. In non-vacuum case, the constant curvature
scalar condition is described by

F (R0)R0 − 2f (R0) = κT.

(8)

Making use of the generalized Landau-Liftshitz prescription for the Schwarzschild-
de Sitter universe, Multam¨aki et al.[50] calculated energy distribution for some well
known f (R) gravity models including constant curvature scalar. Later, Amir and
Naheed[51] considered a spatially homogeneous rotating spacetime solution of f (R)
gravity to calculate Landau-Liftshitz energy density. Moreover, using some well-
known f (R) theory suggestions, Salti et al.[52] also discussed energy-momentum
localization problem for G¨odel-Type metrics. These studies motivate us to discuss
energy-momentum problem for another background in f (R)-gravity and extend those
works.

The paper is organized as follows.

In the second section, we give a brief
information about the Landau-Liftshitz distribution in f (R) gravity for the Bianchi-
VI type spacetime. Next, in the third section, we calculate energy density considering
Landau-Liftshitz distribution for some speciﬁc f (R) models. Finally, we devote the last
section to discussions.

In the canonical cartesian coordinates, the homogenous Bianchi-Type VI spacetime

is deﬁned by the following line-element[53]:

ds2 = dt2 − dx2 − e2(A−1)xdy2 − e2(A+1)xdz2,

where A is a constant with 0 ≤ A ≤ 1. The metric tensor gµν, its form gµν and √−g

for the Bianchi-Type VI model can be written, respectively, as:

(13)

gµν = (1,−1,−e2(A−1)x,−e2(A+1)x),
gµν = (1,−1,−e2(1−A)x,−e−2(A+1)x),
√−g = e2Ax.

Next, the nonvanishing component of Christoﬀel symbols are calculated as

Γ1
22 = (A − 1)e2(A−1)x,
Γ1
33 = − (A + 1)e2(A+1)x,
Γ2
12 = Γ2
Γ3
13 = Γ3

21 = (A − 1),
31 = (A + 1).

Using the above results, the surviving components of Ricci tensor become

R11 = − 2(A2 + 1),
R22 = 2A(1 − A)e2(A−1)x,
R33 = − 2A(1 + A)e2(A+1)x.

Additionally, the constant value of Ricci scalar is

R = R0 = 6A2 + 2.

Consequently, in the f(R)-gravity, one can easily write down the generalized form of
Landau-Liftshitz energy distribution as given below

3. Energy in speciﬁc f (R) Models

In this section
There are many suggested models in the f (R) theory of gravity[54].
of the study, we mainly consider ﬁve diﬀerent well-known models to calculate energy
momentum distribution associated with Bianchi-Tpe VI spacetime exactly.

• The ﬁrst model[55, 56] is described in a polynomial form:

f1st(R) = R + ξR2,

(24)

where ξ denotes a positive real number.

• The second model[57] is given by

Localized energy associated with Bianchi-Type VI universe in f (R) theory of gravity 5

f2nd(R) = R −

ǫ4
R

,

(25)

where ǫ is a constant parameter. This model is known also as the dark energy model of
f (R)-gravity.

• The next model[58] is deﬁned as

f3th(R) = R − pR−1 − qR2,

with p, q are constant.

• Another one is given by the following deﬁnition[59]:
σ ! + (−1)n−1qRn.

f4th(R) = R − p ln |R|

Here n represents an integer and p, q, σ are constant parameters.

• The ﬁnal model is known as the chameleon model and it is given by[57]

f5th(R) = R − (1 − m)λ2(cid:18) R
λ2(cid:19)

m

− 2Λ,

(26)

(27)

(28)

where Λ denotes the cosmological constant, m shows an integer and λ is a constant
parameter.

For suitable choices of above constants, all of the f (R) models mentioned above can
deﬁne the general relativity exactly. Now, considering the above f (R) gravity models
and equation (22), one can obtain the following energy densities:

4. Concluding Remarks

Considering Bianchi-Type VI spacetime representation and some popular models of
f (R) gravity with constant Ricci curvature scalar, we have mainly evaluated the Landau-
Liftshitz energy distribution. All of the calculations have been performed in cartesian
coordinates. We have found that the energy distribution of Bianchi-Type VI model in
f (R) gravity as below:

1

τ 00 = −

2κ n[R0F (R0) − f (R0)] − 16A2e4AxF (R0)o .

Assuming Amin = 0, one can see that the energy momentum distributions transform
into the following forms:

It is seen that all energy distributions are constant. Therefore, it can be generalized
that

τ 00
All(A=0) = constant

(40)

On the other hand, in case of A = Amax = 1, the energy momentum distributions for all
models do not have constant values as expected. Moreover, when we take f (R) = R0 in
equation (22) it can be concluded that

τ 00
GR = −
