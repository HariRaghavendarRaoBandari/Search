For the laser wakeﬁeld acceleration, suppression of beam energy spread while keeping suﬃcient charge is one of the key
challenges. In order to achieve this, we propose bichromatic laser ionization injection with combined laser wavelengths
of 2.4µm and 0.8µm for wakeﬁeld excitation and for triggering electron injection via ﬁeld ionization, respectively. A
laser pulse at 2.4µm wavelength enables one to drive an intense acceleration structure with relatively low laser power.
To further reduce the requirement of laser power, we also propose to use carbon dioxide as the working gas medium,
where carbon acts as the injection element. Our full three dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that electron
beams at the GeV energy level with both low energy spreads (around one percent) and high charges (several tens of
picocoulomb) can be obtained by this scheme with laser parameters achievable in the near future.

Ever since its invention, the laser wakeﬁeld accelerator
(LWFA) has been considered as one of the most promising
candidates of the next generation of accelerators1. Compared
with conventional radio-frequency accelerators, a laser wake-
ﬁeld accelerator has the advantage of several orders higher ac-
celeration gradient, meanwhile currently it has the drawbacks
of relatively poor beam qualities. Great progresses has been
made over the past years2–7. Nevertheless, to further improve
the beam quality including the charge, peak energy, energy
spread, and emittance is still one of the top priorities in the
community in order to make the LWFA suitable for applica-
tions.

There are mainly two ways of improving the output beam
quality. One is improving the beam phase space distribution
during the acceleration processes8, and the other is improv-
ing the injection processes at the very beginning of the ac-
celeration9–11. Among the variety of injection schemes, the
ionization-induced injection is found to be simple and eﬀec-
tive12–20. By using diﬀerent variations of this mechanism,
electron beams with low emittances down to the nano-meter
level21–23, or low energy spreads down to a few percent24–26
were produced. Recently, a new ionization injection varia-
tion utilizing the beating of bichromatic lasers to produce sub-
percent energy spread is proposed27. In this scheme, the driver
is a femtosecond laser pulse with two frequency components
ω1,2, and the laser peak electric ﬁeld amplitude evolves due
to the dispersion diﬀerence of the two frequency components.
The evolution length period of the electric ﬁeld amplitude is

FIG. 1. Ionization probability after one laser cycle vs. laser electric
ﬁeld amplitude for diﬀerent situations predicted by the ADK model.
(a) The laser is either with the wavelength of 2.4 µm (solid lines)
or with 0.8 µm (dash lines). The black/red/blue colors represent
the cases of C4+, N5+ and O6+, whose L-shells have already been
stripped oﬀ by laser pre-pulses.
(b) The laser is square-wave-like
bichromatic with wavelengths of 2.4 µm and 0.8 µm, and the ion-
ization object is C4+. The solid line shows the ionization probability
after one laser cycle when the combined electric ﬁeld takes the form
of E10 hcos(ωt) + 1
3 cos(3ωt)i, and the dash-dot line shows that when
it takes the form of E10 hsin(ωt) + 1

3 sin(3ωt)i.

which is typically in hundred micrometers or millimeter
scales, where ωp is the plasma frequency. Consequently, the
ionization triggered injections only occur in comparably con-
ﬁned volumes. The optimal combination of bichromatic laser
components is found to have the ratio of ω1/ω2 = 1
3 and
E10/E20 = 3, where E10 and E20 are the electric ﬁeld am-
plitude of the two components. Using this certain combina-
tion, the electric ﬁeld wave form of the laser switches between
sin(ωt) + 1
3 cos(3ωt) when propagat-
ing in the plasma, and resembles a square wave in the former
form. Thus this scheme is also called the square-wave-like
bichromatic laser (SWBL) injections.

3 sin(3ωt) and cos(ωt) + 1

In this letter, we extend the SWBL injection scheme to the

mid-infrared laser region. Instead of a 800 nm laser combined
with a frequency tripled split oﬀ part27, we use a laser pulse
with 2.4 µm wave length and combined with a 800 nm laser.
Such 2.4 µm laser pulse in the 100 TW level using OPCPA
technique is already under design28. Moreover, we choose a
few-cycle 800 nm laser pulse as the ω2 component, which is
a standard laser technique29–31. Carbon dioxide is chosen as
the injection gas, but the actual injection element is carbon
instead of oxygen. This reduces the required laser intensity to
less than a half compared with the case of using nitrogen.

Many of the existing studies use nitrogen as the injection
gas, because the ionization threshold of the nitrogen inner
shell is very close to the femtosecond laser electric ﬁeld am-
plitude that widely achievable recently16,18. There are also a
few use carbon dioxide or oxygen as the injection gas, but only
oxygen atoms contribute to the injections17,19. In order to see
the diﬀerent ionization thresholds for the inner shell of a few
such elements, we use the widely accepted ADK model32–34.
According to this model, the ionization probabilities for diﬀer-
ent elements under diﬀerent laser ﬁeld amplitudes are shown
in Fig. 1.

Figure 1(a) shows the ionization probability after one laser
cycle vs. electric ﬁeld amplitude either for 2.4 µm or for
0.8 µm lasers. Only the ﬁrst K-shell electrons are considered.
We do not consider the L-shell electrons because they can be
fully ionized by the electric ﬁelds which are even one magni-
tude smaller than the one used in the plot. And we also do not
plot the ionization probability for the second K-shell electrons
because they are not necessary in our discussions. We can see
that for notable ionization probabilities (Pion & 1%), the elec-
tric ﬁeld amplitude should exceed about 3.3, 5.4 and 8.1 TV/m
for C4+, N5+, and O6+, respectively. Thus the ratio of the laser
intensity thresholds to ionize the inner shell of these three el-
ements is about 1:2.7:6. In many simulations, we empirically
ﬁnd that a relatively larger laser spot size (thus lower laser in-
tensity if the laser power is ﬁxed) and lower plasma density
can increase both the ﬁnal output electron beam energy and
charge. So we choose carbon as the ionization injection ele-
ment in the following discussions.

Figure 1(b) shows the ionization probability after one laser
cycle when a combined SWBL laser is used. The solid
and dash-dot lines show the ionization probability when
the laser is in the form of E10 hcos(ωt) + 1
3 cos(3ωt)i and
E10 hsin(ωt) + 1
3 sin(3ωt)i, respectively. The big diﬀerence of
these two lines is because that the ionization rate grows expo-
nentially when the peak electric ﬁeld increases34. One can see
that the thresholds for notable ionization probabilities are 2.5
and 3.4 TV/m for the two waveforms, respectively. It means
that the intermittent K-shell ionization can occur if E10 is be-
tween 2.5 and 3.4 TV/m.

We performed a series of full three dimensional (3D)
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the injection and
acceleration processes using the code OSIRIS35. According
to the previous conclusions, we choose carbon as the injection
element, and both CH4 and CO2 can be the candidate. But
CO2 has the priority because of the safety considerations. The
electric ﬁeld amplitude of the 2.4 µm component is chosen to

FIG. 2. Schematic diagram of the plasma proﬁle in the simula-
tions. The pseudo-color plot shows the distribution of the back-
ground plasma electrons, and the black solid line in the middle shows
the longitudinal density proﬁle of C4+. The region from z = 0 to
1000 µm is uniform for both the background plasma and C4+. The
region from z = 1400 µm to inﬁnite is a transversely parabolic chan-
nel without C4+. The region from z = −400 to 0 µm is a transi-
tion from vacuum to the plasma, and the region from z = 1000 to
1400 µm is a transition from the uniform region to the channel. The
axial plasma density in the channel is the same as the density of the
uniform region.

be 3.07 TV/m, corresponding to the normalized vector poten-
tial of a10 = 2.295 which can excite a relativistic wake to trap
electrons. Consequently the 0.8 µm component has the nor-
malized vector potential of a20 = 0.255. From the above dis-
cussions it is clear that under this intensity, the oxygen atoms
do not provide K-shell electrons. The two components of the
SWBL have the same waist size of W10 = W20 = 60 µm.
The laser pulse component of 2.4 µm wavelength has the full-
width-half-maximum (FWHM) duration of 100 fs, and the
0.8 µm component has the duration of 10 fs. Their proﬁle
maximums overlap initially. We use shorter duration of the
0.8 µm component to avoid ionization injection from multi-
ple electric ﬁeld peaks. The gas target proﬁle is schemati-
cally shown in Fig. 2. The uniform region from z = 0 to
1000 µm is used for a stable SWBL injection. The channel
from z = 1400 µm to inﬁnite is used for a stable long dis-
tance acceleration, which has a matched channel depth5. The
plasma density of the uniform region is np = 1.92 ×1017 cm−3,
so that the theoretical injection interval is 1.8 mm according to
Eq. 1. We choose three cases of C4+ densities for simulations:
nC4+ = 0.28, 0.56 and 1.2 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. The last
choice means we have to use pure CO2 in the injection stage,
because each CO2 molecule provides 16 background plasma
electrons, and nC4+/np = 1

16 is the maximum.

Firstly, we present the results from nC4+ = 0.28 ×1016 cm−3.
Some typical laser-plasma snapshots together with the (pz, z)
phase space plots of the injected electrons are shown in Fig. 3.
Figure 3(a) to 3(d) are some snapshots of the acceleration
structure. Figure 3(e) shows the laser peak electric ﬁeld evo-
lution. At the beginning, the laser evolves as the theoretical
prediction for a SWBL with a period of ∆z = 1.8 mm ac-
cording to Eq. 1. Later it undergoes the self-focusing and
the focusing due to the channel for z > 1.4 mm.
It is
worth noting that such self-focusing can occur even in uni-
form plasma without channel, and the self-focal length is
zsf = ZR(P/Pc − 1)−1/2 = 2.7 mm by the weak relativistic as-
sumptions25. In our case, the injection stage, which has C4+,

FIG. 3. (a-d) Four snapshots of plasma electron density distributions. The blue color shows the plasma density projections to 3 planes. The
contours in the right half of the boxes show the laser electric ﬁelds at diﬀerent distances. The red dots in (b-d) show the injected electrons
(multimedia view 1). (e) The laser peak electric ﬁeld vs. z. (f) The energy and energy spread evolution of injected beam. (g) and (h) show

is in the range of −400 µm < z < 1400 µm. This is the rea-
son why there is no injection due to self-focusing, and only
one injection bunch exists as show in Fig. 3(g). Although not
explicitly showing here, it can be seen from the supplemen-
tal multimedia of Fig. 3(g) and 3(h) that the injection starts
from z = 220 µm and ends at z = 980 µm. Figure 3(f) shows
the energy and energy spread evolution of the injected beam.
One can see that the energy spread reaches a minimal at about
z = 1 cm even though the energy still grows linearly after that.
This is because that the phase rotation before dephasing is the
main process for minimizing the energy spread. Figure 3(h)
shows the phase space distribution at the optimal acceleration
distance, i. e. the distance where the relative energy spread has
its minimal value. The energy spread is 0.88 % in FWHM in
this case. One may note that there is another small spike in
the phase space projection in Fig. 3(h). This spike is from the
same injection period instead of another bunch.

Next we present the results using diﬀerent nC4+: (1) 0.28 ×
1016 cm−3, (2) 0.56 × 1016 cm−3 and (3) 1.2 × 1016 cm−3. The
laser evolutions and the injection processes are similar, but
the output electron beams show diﬀerences as one can see in
Fig. 4. From Fig. 4(a) to 4(c), one can see that the beam in-
jections only occur in the injection stage (z < 1.4 mm), during
which the emittance in the laser polarization direction ǫ ∗
p also
grows abruptly. In the acceleration stage (z > 1.4 mm) ǫ ∗
p
oscillates and grows slowly. Similar phenomenon is also ob-
served by others36. One can also observe that the emittance in
the other transverse direction ǫ ∗
s continuously grows slowly.
Figure 4(d) shows the optimal acceleration distances and the
energy gain at these distances for the three cases. The posi-
tive correlation of the optimal acceleration distances and nC4+
is because that the beam loading eﬀect modiﬁes the acceler-
ation electric ﬁeld, thus a larger injected charge makes the

(pz, z) phase rotation slower37. Figure 4(e) shows the charges
and energy spreads for the three cases. It is clear that a larger
number of injected charges makes the relative energy spread
larger, although the optimal acceleration distance is longer,
and the corresponding energy gain is larger. We also plot
the charge numbers within the FWHM in the energy spectra.
One can see that about a half of the beam charge is inside the
FWHM range, thus the FWHM energy spreads truly represent
the beam qualities. Figure 4(f) shows the spectra of the three
cases at the optimal acceleration distances.

To conclude, we have proposed a new conﬁguration for pro-
ducing high quality beams in LWFAs. The gas target has an
injection stage with a uniform distribution of pure CO2 or CO2
mixed with some background gas, and an acceleration stage
with transversely parabolic distributed pre-discharged plasma
channels. The background gas and the gas in the accelera-
tion stage can be a regular low-Z gas such as H2 or He, and
can also be O2 since the K-shell of O has extremely low ion-
ization probability with the laser amplitude we are using. A
dual-color laser pulse with a waist of 60 µm is adopted, where
the main pulse has a duration of 100 fs at the wavelength of
2.4 µm, and the trigger pulse has a duration of 10 fs at the
wavelength of 0.8 µm, but the maximums of their proﬁle over-
lap. Femtosecond level temporal synchronization of these two
pulses is required. Such 2.4 µm (100 fs duration, 71 TW peak
power) laser system is under design28, and such 0.8 µm (10
fs duration, 7.9 TW peak power) laser technique is already
available31. Output electron beam can have charge and energy
spread of (13.56 pC, 0.88%), (27.05 pC, 1.25%) or (57.22 pC,
1.38%) for diﬀerent densities of CO2 cases. It is also worth
noting that higher injected charge is achievable by using an-
other injection gas which provide fewer background electrons,
such as CH4. Our conﬁguration can produce several times

higher charge compared with other LWFA researches with en-
ergy spreads of the 1% level. This is because the main pulse
at longer wavelength and a relatively low plasma density are
used in our scheme, thus with a limited power the laser pulse
can have much larger waist, which can drive a larger wake
structure to load a higher electron beam charge with a good
quality. Our scheme is very helpful for the applications re-
quiring high charge and low energy spread38–40.
