On parabolic external maps

L. Lomonaco, C. Petersen, W. Shen

March 7, 2016

Abstract

We prove that any C 1+BV degree d ≥ 2 circle covering h hav-
ing all periodic orbits weakly expanding, is conjugate by a C 1+BV
diﬀeomorphism to a metrically expanding map. We use this to con-
nect the space of parabolic external maps (coming from the theory of
parabolic-like maps) to metrically expanding circle coverings.

Introduction

In this paper we provide a connection between the worlds of real and complex
dynamics by proving theorems on degree d ≥ 2 circle coverings which are in-
teresting in the world of real dynamics per se and interesting in the world
of complex dynamics through quasi-conformal surgery. The main theorem
states that any C 1+BV degree d ≥ 2 circle covering h (where h ∈ C 1+BV
means Dh is continuous and of bounded variation), all of whose periodic
orbits are weakly expanding, is conjugate in the same smoothness class to a
metrically expanding map. Here weakly expanding means that for any peri-
odic point p of period s there exists a punctured neighborhood of p on which
Dhs(x) > 1. And metrically expanding means Dh(x) > 1 holds everywhere,
except at parabolic points. This theorem strengthens a theorem by Ma˜n´e
[M] who proved the same conclusion holds under the stronger assumption
that h is C 2 with all periodic points hyperbolic repelling.

The real analytic version of the above theorem, which comes for the same
price, provides a missing link between the space of parabolic external maps
from the theory of parabolic-like maps and metrically expanding circle cov-
erings. For an enlargement on the theory of parabolic-like maps and the role
of parabolic external maps in this theory see the introduction to Section 4
and the paper by the ﬁrst author [L].

2 Setting and statement of the results

Recall that a locally diﬀeomorphic covering map h : S1 → S1 has degree d 6= 0
if and only if h(ei2πx) lifts to E(x) := ei2πx as a diﬀeomorphism H : R → R
with H(x + 1) = H(x) + d. It will be convenient to work mostly with H and
the induced map also denoted H : T → T := R/Z. Denote by Fd the set of
all locally diﬀeomorphic, real analytic covering maps h : S1 → S1 of degree d.
And denote by Par(h) the set of parabolic periodic points for h. Note that
for 0 < d the multiplier of any parabolic orbit is 1.

d

We denote by F 1+BV

the set of locally diﬀeomorphic covering maps h :
S1 → S1 of degree d > 0 with h ∈ C 1+BV (i.e. identifying S1 with T := R/Z
and writing Dh for the derivative of h, the function Dh is continuous and
of bounded variation). Clearly for every d ≥ 1, Fd ⊂ F 1+BV
(note that we
ﬁnd a whole range of spaces in between such as F r+ǫ
∩ C r+ǫ with
r = 2, 3, . . . and 0 < ǫ ≤ 1, where C r+ǫ are the maps which have an ǫ-H¨older
r-th derivative. In this context Fd is naturally denoted F ω

d ⊂ F 1+BV

Consider the class T ∗

of maps h for which for every periodic
point p say of period s, there is a neighborhood U(p) of p such that for all
x ∈ U(p) \ {p} : Dhs(x) > 1. This is, h is a degree d locally diﬀeomorphic
covering of the circle, with continuous derivative of bounded variation, and
with all periodic points either repelling or parabolic-repelling.

Finally a map h ∈ F 1+BV

is called metrically expanding if for all x in
S1 \ Par(h), Dh(x) > 1. We shall see that for such maps Par(h) is a ﬁnite
set. We denote by M1+BV
the sub-class of metrically expanding
maps, Md = Fd ∩ M1+BV
, and by Md,1 ⊂ Md the set of real-analytic such
h with precisely one parabolic point.

can take the conjugacy map to be C r+ǫ respective C ω.

The proof of this Theorem is the core objective of Section 3, where it is

stated as Corollary 3.2.

A degree d circle map h : S1 → S1 is topologically expanding, if every
interval eventually expands onto the entire circle or equivalently the map is
topologically conjugate to the map Pd(z) = zd. We denote by T 1+BV
= {h ∈
F 1+BV
∩ Fd and by Td,1 ⊂ Td
the set of topologically expanding real-analytic maps with Par(h) a singleton.

Denote by τ the reﬂection, both in S1 (τ (z) := 1/z) and in R (τ (z) = z).
A parabolic external map is a map h ∈ Fd with the following properties:

• h : S1 → S1 is a degree d ≥ 2 real-analytic covering of the unit circle,

with a ﬁnite set P ar(h) of parabolic points p of multiplier 1,

• the map h extends to a holomorphic covering map h : W ′ → W of
degree d, where W ′, W are reﬂection symmetric annular neighborhoods
of S1. We write W+ := W \ D, and W ′

+ := W ′ \ D,

• for each p ∈ P ar(h) there exists a dividing arc γp satisfying :

– p ∈ γp ⊂ W \ D and γp is smooth except at p,
– γp ∩ γp′ = ∅ for p 6= p′,
– h : γp ∩ W ′ → γh(p) is a diﬀeomorphism,
– γp divides W and W ′ into Ωp, ∆p and Ω′

connected, and such that h : ∆′
D ∪ Ω′

p ⊂ D ∪ Ωp,

– calling Ω =Tp Ωp and Ω′ =Tp Ω′

p respectively, all
p → ∆h(p) is an isomorphism and

p, ∆′

p, we have Ω′ ∪ D ⊂⊂ W ∪ D.

We denote by Pd ⊂ Fd the set of parabolic external maps, and by Pd,1 ⊂ Pd
the set of h ∈ Pd for which P ar(h) is a singleton z0. To emphasize the ge-
ometric properties of maps h ∈ Pd we shall also write (h, W ′, W, γ) for such

maps, where γ =Sp γp, though neither the domain, range or dividing arcs

are unique or in any way canonical. An external map for any parabolic-like
map belongs to Pd (see Section 4.2). Note that the set Pd is invariant un-
der conjugacy by a real analytic diﬀeomorphism this is, for any h ∈ Pd and
φ ∈ F1 : φ ◦ h ◦ φ−1 ∈ Pd.
It is easy to see that Pd ⊂ Td (see Proposi-
tion 4.2). In particular Pd,1 ⊂ Td,1 and so any two maps h1, h2 ∈ Pd,1 are
topologically conjugate by a unique orientation preserving homeomorphism
sending parabolic point to parabolic point.

Set hd(z) = zd+(d−1)/(d+1)

(d−1)zd/(d+1)+1 , and deﬁne Hd,1 = {h ∈ Fd| h ∼qs hd} (where
h ∼qs hd means that h is quasi-symmetrically conjugate to the map hd). It is
rather easy to see that hd ∈ Pd,1, see Lemma 4.2. Moreover clearly hd ∈ Td
so that Hd,1 ⊆ Td,1. In Section 4.3 we prove:

Proposition 2.3. Suppose h1, h2 ∈ Pd are topologically conjugate by an
orientation preserving homeomorphism φ, which preserves parabolic points.
Then φ is quasi-symmetric. In particular Pd,1 ⊆ Hd,1 ⊆ Td,1.

3

Let bFd := Fd/F1 denote the set of conjugacy classes of maps in Fd under
real analytic diﬀeomorphisms, and call πd : Fd → bFd the natural projection.

As a consequence of the above we have (see also page 18):

Theorem 2.4. For every d ≥ 2 we have

Md ⊂ Pd = Td

and Md,1 ⊂ Pd,1 = Hd,1 = Td,1

Moreover

πd(Md) = πd(Pd) = πd(Td)

and

πd(Md,1) = πd(Pd,1) = πd(Hd,1) = πd(Td,1).

3 Topologically expanding self coverings of

the unit circle

Recall that for each integer d ≥ 2, the set T ∗
d denotes the collection of
all orientation preserving covering maps h : S1 → S1 with the following
properties:

1. h has degree d;

2. h is a C 1 local diﬀeomorphism and the derivative Dh has bounded

variation;

3. If p is a periodic point of h with period s, then there is a neighborhood

U(p) of p such that Dhs(x) > 1 holds for all x ∈ U(p) \ {p}.

Theorem 3.1. For each map h ∈ T ∗
a positive integer N and a real analytic function ρ : S1 → R+ such that

d , Par(h) is ﬁnite. Moreover, there exists

|DhN (x)|ρ :=

ρ(hN (x))

ρ(x)

DhN (x) > 1

holds for all x ∈ S1 \ Par(h).

In particular, the theorem claims that a map h ∈ T ∗

d without neutral
cycles is uniformly expanding on the whole phase space S1, a result proved
by Ma˜n´e [M] under a stronger assumption that h is C 2. Some partial result
on the validity of Ma˜n´e’s theorem under the C 1+BV condition was obtained
in [MJ].

Recall that a map h ∈ T ∗

d is called metrically expanding if Dh(x) > 1

holds for x ∈ S1 \ Par(h).

4

Corollary 3.2. Each map h ∈ T ∗
is conjugate to a metrically expanding
d
map via a C 1+BV diﬀeomorphism. Moreover, if h is C r+ǫ, r = 2, 3, . . . , ∞, ω,
0 < ǫ ≤ 1 we can take the conjugacy map to be C r+ǫ.

Proof. Let ρ and N be given by Theorem 3.1 and set

ρ∗(x) =

N −1Xj=0

ρ(hj(x))Dhj(x)

which is a continuous function with bounded variation. Then a computation
shows that

|Dh(x)|ρ∗ = Dh(x) ·

ρ∗(h(x))

ρ∗(x)

=

DhN (x)ρ(hN (x)) +PN −1

ρ(x) +PN −1

j=1 Dhj(x)ρ(hj(x))

j=1 Dhj(x)ρ(hj(x))

which is strictly greater than one for x ∈ S1 \ Par(h).

Let us complete the proof. Identify S1 with R/Z via ei2πx 7→ x mod 1.

Then the map

φ(x) :=Z x

0

Cρ∗dx = CZ x

0

ρ∗dx, with

1
C

=Z 1

0

ρ∗dx

deﬁnes a C 1+BV diﬀeomorphism of S1, and setting g := φ ◦ h ◦ φ−1, we obtain
that Dg(φ(x)) = |Dh(x)|ρ∗ > 1 for all x ∈ S1 \ Par(h).

Clearly, if h is C r then so is φ.

The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem 3.1. The condi-
tion that Dh has bounded variation is used to control the distortion. Recall
that the distortion of h on an interval J ⊂ S1 is deﬁned as

Dist(h, J) = sup
x,y∈J

log

|Dh(x)|
|Dh(y)|

.

Lemma 3.1. There exists a C0 > 0 such that, for any interval J ⊂ S1 and
n ≥ 1, if J, h(J), .., hn−1(J) are intervals with pairwise disjoint interiors,
then

Dist(hn, J) ≤ C0.

Proof. Since h is a C 1 covering and Dh has bounded variation, log Dh also
has bounded variation. For each x, y ∈ J,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)log

Dhn(x)

Dhn(y)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

n−1Xi=0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)log

Dh(hi(x))

Dh(hi(y))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

Var(log Dh, hi(J))

n−1Xi=0

is bounded from above by the total variation of log Dh.

3.1 Proof of Theorem 3.1

The main step is to prove that a map h ∈ T ∗
properties.

d has the following expanding

Proposition 3.3. For each h ∈ T ∗

d the following properties hold:

(a) Par(h) is a ﬁnite set.

(b) There exists a constant K0 > 0 such that Dhk(x) ≥ K0 holds for each

x ∈ S1 and k ≥ 1.

(c) For each x 6∈S∞

k=0 h−k(Par(h)), Dhn(x) → ∞ as n → ∞.

(d) Let p be a ﬁxed point and let δ0 > 0, K > 0 be constants. Then there

exists δ = δ(p, δ0, K) > 0 such that if

d(x, p) < δ and

k

max
j=1

d(hj(x), p) ≥ δ0,

then Dhk(x) ≥ K.

(e) For any K > 0, there exists a positive integer n0 such that for each

n > n0 and x ∈ h−n(Par(h)) \ h−n+1(Par(h)), we have Dhn(x) ≥ K.

Assuming the proposition for the moment, let us complete the proof of
Theorem 3.1. Replacing h by an iterate if necessary, we may assume that
all points in Par(h) are ﬁxed points (since Par(h) is ﬁnite). We say that a
function ρ : S1 → (0, ∞) is admissible if the following properties are satisﬁed:

(A1) there is δ0 > 0 such that whenever x ∈ B(p, δ0) \ {p} for some p ∈

Par(h), we have ρ(h(x)) > ρ(x);

(A2) for any x ∈ S1 \ Par(h) and s ≥ 1 with hs(x) ∈ Par(h), we have

|Dhs(x)|ρ ≥ 2.

Lemma 3.2. There exists a real analytic admissible function ρ.

Proof. Let X0 = Par(h) and Xk = h−k(Par(h)) \ h−k+1(Par(h)) for each
k ≥ 1. By Proposition 3.3 (e), there exists n0 such that Dhn(x) ≥ 4 holds for
x ∈ Xn, n > n0. Let ρ0 = min{Df k(x) : x ∈ Xk for some k = 1, 2, . . . , n0}.

a real analytic function of period 1 with the following properties:

Let π : R → S1 be the universal covering π(t) = e2πit. Let bρ : R → (0, ∞) be
(i) bρ(ˆp) = 1, bρ′(ˆp) = 0 and bρ′′(ˆp) > 0 for each ˆp ∈ π−1(Par(h));

6

(ii) bρ(ˆx) < ρ0/2 holds for each ˆx ∈ π−1(X1 ∪ X2 ∪ · · · ∪ Xn0);
(iii) 0 <bρ(ˆx) < 2 for allbx ∈ R.

It is easy to see that there is a smooth function ˇρ satisfying all the require-
ments. To get a real analytic one, choose ǫ > 0 such that (ii) holds for ˇρ
on a 2ǫ-neighbourhood of π−1(X1 ∪ X2 ∪ · · · ∪ Xn0) and ˇρ′′(x) > 0 on a 2ǫ-
neighbourhood of π−1(Par(h)). Write π−1(Par(h)) ∩ [0, 1[:= {ˆp1 < . . . < ˆpn}

ǫ-neighbourhood of π−1(X1 ∪ X2 ∪ · · · ∪ Xn0). Let φ be the corresponding

desired real-analytic function.

and let δ > 0 be given by Lemma 3.3 below. And let eρ be a partial sum of
the Fourier series of ˇρ satisfying eρ′(yj) = 0 for some yj with |yj − ˆpj| < δ for
each j, eρ′′(x) > 0 on a ǫ-neighbourhood of π−1(Par(h)) and eρ < ρ0/2 on an
real-analytic diﬀeomorphism given by Lemma 3.3. Then bρ = eρ ◦ φ is the
The function bρ induces a function ρ : S1 → R by the formula ρ(e2πt) =
bρ(t). The property (A1) follows from (i) immediately. Let us check the prop-

erty (A2). Of course it suﬃces to show |Dhn(x)|ρ ≥ 2 for each x ∈ Xn,
n ≥ 1. If n ≤ n0, then Dhn(x) ≥ ρ0, ρ(x) ≤ ρ0/2 and ρ(hn(x)) = 1, hence
|Dhn(x)|ρ ≥ 2. If n > n0, then Dhn(x) ≥ 4, ρ(x) < 2 and ρ(hn(x)) = 1,
hence again |Dhn(x)|ρ ≥ 2.

Lemma 3.3. Given ǫ > 0 and n ≥ 1 distinct x1 < . . . < xn < x1 + 1 there
exists δ > 0 such that for any set of n points y1, . . . , yn with |yj − xj| < δ
for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n there exists a real-analytic diﬀeomorphism φ : R → R,
satisfying for all x ∈ R: φ(x+1) = φ(x)+1, |φ(x)−x| < ǫ, and |φ′(x)−1| < ǫ
and for each j : φ(xj) = yj.

Proof. If n = 1 set δ = ǫ and φ(x) = x + y1 − x1. Otherwise set

m = min{(x2 − x1), . . . (xn − xn−1), (1 + x1 − xn)}

and deﬁne gj(x) := sin2(π(x − xj)) for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Then gj is 1-
periodic, 0 ≤ gj(x) ≤ 1 for all x with gj(x) = 0 only at xj and the absolute
value of g′

j(x) = π sin(2π(x − xj)) is bounded by π. Set

Gj(x) := Yi,i6=j

gi(x)

So that 0 ≤ Gj(x) ≤ 1, Gj(xi) = 0 for i 6= j, |G′

j(x)| ≤ π(n − 1) and

Gj(xj) = Yi,i6=j

gi(xj) ≥ K(m)

7

where K(m) is a constant depending only on m. Deﬁne

φ(x) = x +

(yj − xj)

Gj(x)
Gj(xj)

nXj=1

so that φ(xj) = yj for each j. Then for δ = mǫ/n2 and for each j : |yj−xj| < δ
the map φ is the desired diﬀeomorphism.

Fix an admissible function ρ as above and let

η = inf
y∈S1

ρ(y)/ sup

(1)

Note that |Dhk(x)|ρ ≥ ηDhk(x) holds for any x ∈ S1 and any k ≥ 1.

We say that a set U is eventually expanding if there exists a positive integer
k(U) such that whenever k ≥ k(U) and x ∈ U \ Par(h), we have |Dhk(x)|ρ >
1. The assertion of Theorem 3.1 is that S1 is eventually expanding.

Completion of proof of Theorem 3.1. By compactness, it suﬃces to show that
each x0 ∈ S1 has an eventually expanding neighborhood U(x0).

Case 1. Assume hk(x0) 6∈ Par(h) for each k ≥ 0. Then by Proposition 3.3
(c), Dhk(x0) → ∞ as k → ∞, so by continuity, there exists a k0 and a
neighborhood U(x0) of x0 such that, for x ∈ U(x0), Dhk0(x) ≥ 2
K0η . By
Proposition 3.3 (b), for all k ≥ k0 and x ∈ U(x0),

Dhk(x) = Dhk0(x)Dhk−k0(hk0(x)) ≥ K0Dhk0(x) ≥

2
η

,

hence

|Dhk(x)|ρ ≥ ηDhk(x) ≥ 2.

Thus U(x0) is eventually expanding.

Case 2. Assume that hk(x0) ∈ Par(h) for some k ≥ 0. By (A2), it suﬃces
to consider the case x ∈ Par(h0). Reducing δ0 in (A1) if necessary, we may
assume that Dh(x) > 1 holds on B(x0, δ0) \ {x0}. Let K = 2/η and let δ =
δ(x0, δ0, K) > 0 be a small constant given by Proposition 3.3 (d). Let us prove
that |Dhk(x)|ρ > 1 holds for all x ∈ B(x0, δ)\{x0} and k ≥ 1, so in particular,
Indeed, if x, h(x), . . . , hk(x) ∈ B(x0, δ0),
B(x0, δ) is eventually expanding.
then ρ(hk(x)) > ρ(x) and Dhk(x) > 1, hence |Dhk(x)|ρ > 1. Otherwise, we
have Dhk(x) > 2/η which implies that |Dhk(x)|ρ ≥ ηDhk(x) ≥ 2.

3.2 Geometric expanding properties of topological ex-

panding maps

This section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 3.3. Throughout, ﬁx
h ∈ T ∗
d . We shall ﬁrst establish lower bounds on the derivative of ﬁrst return
maps to small nice intervals.

Recall an open interval A ⊂ S1 is nice if hn(∂A) ∩ A = ∅ for all n ≥ 0.

Let

D(A) = {x ∈ S1 : ∃k ≥ 1 such that hk(x) ∈ A}.

For each x ∈ D(A), the ﬁrst entry time k(x) is the minimal positive integer
such that hk(x)(x) ∈ A. The ﬁrst entry map RA : D(A) → A is deﬁned
by x 7→ hk(x)(x). For x ∈ D(A) ∩ A, the entry time is also called the ﬁrst
return time and the map RA|D(A)∩A is called the ﬁrst return map. For a nice
interval A and any component J of D(A), the entry time k(x) is independent
of x ∈ J, and if we denote the common entry time by k, then the intervals
J, h(J), . . . , hk−1(J) are pairwise disjoint and hk : J → A is a diﬀeomorphsim.
There is an arbitrarily small nice interval around any point z0 ∈ S1.
Indeed, let O be an arbitrary periodic orbit such that hk(z0) 6∈ O for all
k ≥ 0. Then for any n, any component of S1 \ h−n(O) is a nice interval.
By [MMS], h has no wandering interval which implies that h−n(O) is dense
in S1. The statement follows.

Lemma 3.4. For any periodic point p and any constant K > 0, there exists
an arbitrarily small nice interval A ∋ p with the following property. Denote
by A′ the component of D(A) which contains p. Then

DRA(x) > 1 for all x ∈ A′ \ {p}

and

DRA(x) ≥ K for all x ∈ D(A) ∩ (A \ A′).

Proof. Let s0 be the period of p. Let B0 ∋ p be an arbitrary nice interval
such that B ∩ orb(p) = {p}. For each n ≥ 1, deﬁne inductively Bn to be the
component of h−s0(Bn−1) which contains p. Then Bn is a nice interval for
each n and |Bn| → 0 as n → ∞. Let

εn = sup{|J| : J is a component of h−i(Bn) for some i ≥ 0}.

Since h has no wandering intervals, εn → 0 as n → ∞.

Let δ0 be the minimum of the length of the components of B0\B1. Choose

n large enough such that

• εn ≤ e−2C0δ0/K; (where C0 is the total variation of log Dh.)

9

• Dhs0 > 1 on Bn+1 \ {p} (according to the third property deﬁning T ∗

d ) .

Let us verify that A := Bn satisﬁes the desired properties. So let x ∈
A \ A′ = Bn \ Bn+1 and let k ≥ 1 be the ﬁrst return time of x into A. We
need to prove that Dhk(x) ≥ K.

To this end, let T be the component of Bn \ Bn+1 which contains x
and let J be the component of h−k(Bn) which contains x. Then J ⊂ T
and k > ns0. Note that hjs0(T ) is a component of Bn−j \ Bn−j+1 for each
0 ≤ j ≤ n. Since the ﬁrst return time of p to B0 is equal to s0, the inter-
vals B1, h(B1), . . . , hs0−1(B1) are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, the intervals
hj(T ), 0 ≤ j < ns0, are pairwise disjoint. By Lemma 3.1, hs0n|T has distor-
tion bounded by C0. Since hns0(J) is a component of h−k+s0n(Bn), we have
|hns0(J)| ≤ εn. Therefore,

|J|
|T |

≤ eC0εn/δ0.

Since J, h(J), . . . , hk−1(J) are pairwise disjoint, by Lemma 3.1 again, we ob-
tain

Dhk(x) ≥ e−C0 |Bn|
|J|

≥ e−C0 |T |
|J|

≥ K.

Lemma 3.5. For any K ≥ 1, there exists s0 such that if p is a periodic point
with period s ≥ s0 then Dhs(p) ≥ K. In particular, Par(h) is ﬁnite.

Proof. Let p0 be an arbitrary ﬁxed point of h and for each n = 1, 2, . . ., let

εn = min{|J| : J is a component of S1 \ h−n(p0)}.

Then εn → 0 as n → ∞.

By Lemma 3.4, there is a small nice interval A ∋ p0 such that DRA ≥ 1
holds on A′ and DRA > K ≥ 1 holds on D(A) ∩ (A \ A′), where A′ is the
component of h−1(A) which contains p0. Let δ be the minimum of the length
of the components of A \ {p0} and let s0 ≥ 2 be so large that εs ≤ δ/(eC0K)
for all s ≥ s0.

Now let p be a periodic point with period s ≥ s0. We shall prove that
Dhs(p) ≥ K. Assume ﬁrst that there exists p′ ∈ orb(p) ∩ A. Let 0 = t0 <
t1 < t2 < · · · < tn = s the consecutive returns of p′ into A. Note that there
exists 0 ≤ i0 < n such that hti0 (p′) ∈ A \ A′, so

Dhs(p) = Dhs(p′) =

DRA(hti(p′)) ≥ K.

n−1Yi=0

10

Now assume that orb(p) ∩ A = ∅. Let I be an open interval bounded by p0
and some point p′ in orb(p) with the property that I ∩ orb(p) = ∅. Then I
is a nice interval and |I| ≥ δ. Let J be a component of h−s(I) which has p′
as a boundary point. Then hj(J) ∩ I = ∅ for j = 1, 2, . . . , s − 1 and |J| ≤ εs.
By Lemma 3.1, we have

Dhs(p) = Dhs(p′) ≥ e−C0 |I|
|J|

≥ e−C0δ/εs ≥ K.

This proves the ﬁrst statement. As ﬁxed points of hn are isolated for each
n ≥ 1, it follows that Par(h) is ﬁnite.

Lemma 3.6. For each h ∈ T ∗
d , there exists a constant λ0 > 1 such that for
any x ∈ S1 \ Par(h), if A is a suﬃciently small nice interval containing x,
then DRA ≥ λ0 holds on D(A) ∩ A.

Proof. By Lemma 3.5, there exists s0 such that if p is a periodic point with
period s > s0 then Dhs(p) ≥ 2eC0. Let 1 < λ0 < λ1 < 2 be a constant such
that if p 6∈ Par(h) is a periodic point of period s ≤ s0, then Dhs(p) > λ1. Let
δ > 0 be a small constant such that |Dhs(x1) − Dhs(x2)| < λ1 − λ0 whenever
s ≤ s0 and dist(x1, x2) < δ.

Now let x ∈ S1 \ Par(h) and let A ∋ x be a nice interval such that |A| < δ
and A∩Par(h) = ∅. Now consider y ∈ A with k ≥ 1 as the ﬁrst return time of
y to A. Let J be the component of h−k(A) which contains y. Then hk : J → A
is a diﬀeomorphism with distortion bounded by C0. Since J ⊂ A, there is a
ﬁxed point p of hk in J. Note p 6∈ Par(h). Since hj|J is monotone increasing
for all 0 ≤ j ≤ k, k is equal to the period of p. If k ≤ n0 then Df k(p) ≥ λ1
and since |J| ≤ |A| < δ, we have Df k(y) ≥ Df k(p) − (λ1 − λ0) ≥ λ0. If
k > n0, then Dhk(p) ≥ 2eC0, and hence Dhk(y) ≥ e−C0Dhk(p) ≥ 2 > λ0.

Proof of Proposition 3.3. (a). This property was proved in Lemmas 3.5.

pactness, there exist y1, y2, . . . , yr ∈ S1 such thatSr

(b). By Lemmas 3.4 and 3.6, for any y ∈ S1 there is a nice interval
A(y) ∋ y such that the derivative of the ﬁrst return map is at least 1. By com-
i=1 A(yi) = S1. Now con-
sider an arbitrary x ∈ S1 and k ≥ 1. Deﬁne a sequence {in} ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , r}
and {kn} as follows. First let k0 = −1, take i0 such that x ∈ A(yi0) and
let k1 = max{1 ≤ j ≤ k : hj(x) ∈ A(yi0)}. If k1 = k then we stop. Oth-
erwise, take i1 ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , r} \ {i0} be such that hk1+1(x) ∈ A(yi1) and let
k2 = max{k1 < j ≤ k : hj(x) ∈ A(yi1)}. Repeat the argument until we get
kn = k. Then n ≤ r and Dhkj+1−kj −1(hkj+1(x)) ≥ 1. It follows that

Dhk(x) ≥

Dh(hki(x)) ≥(cid:18)min

This proves the property (b).

(c). Assuming hk(x) 6∈ Par(h) for all k ≥ 0, let us prove that Dhk(x) →
∞ as k → ∞. By (b), it suﬃces to show that lim supk→∞ Dhk(x) = ∞. Let
y ∈ ω(x) \ Par(h) and consider a small nice interval A containing y for which
the conclusion of Lemma 3.6 holds. Since y ∈ ω(x) there exist n1 < n2 < · · ·
such that hnk(x) ∈ A. By Lemma 3.6, Dhnk+1−nk(hnk(x)) ≥ λ0 > 1 for all k.
Thus Dhnk+1(x) ≥ Dhn1(x)λk

0 → ∞ as k → ∞.

(d). The proof repeats part of the proof of Lemma 3.4. Let B0 be a
nice interval such that B0 ⊂ B(p, δ0), B0 ∩ orb(p) = {p}. Deﬁne Bn to
be the component of h−n(B0) which contains p. Let τ > 0 be the minimal
length of the components of B0 \ B1. Given K > 0 let n0 be so large that
|Bn0| < e−C0τ K0/K. Choose δ > 0 such that B(p, δ) ⊂ Bn0.

Now assuming that d(x, p) < δ and maxk

j=1 d(hj(x), p) ≥ δ0, let us prove
Dhk(x) ≥ K. Let n ≥ n0 be such that x ∈ Bn \ Bn+1. Note that k > n.
Let J be the component of Bn \ Bn+1 which contains x, then the intervals
J, h(J), . . . , h(n−1)(J) are pairwise disjoint, hn(J) is a component of B0 \ B1.
Thus by Lemma 3.1,

Dhn(x) ≥ e−C0 |hn(J)|

≥ e−C0

|Bn0|
By (b), it follows that Dhk(x) ≥ K0Dhn(x) ≥ K.

|J|

τ

≥ K/K0.

(e). Without loss of generality, we may assume that all periodic points
in Par(h) are ﬁxed points. Let X0 = Par(h) and for n ≥ 1, let Xn =
h−n(Par(h)) \ h−n+1(Par(h)). So for each y ∈ Xn, n is the minimal integer
such that hn(y) ∈ Par(h).

Let δ0 > 0 be a small constant such that h|B(p,δ0) is injective and B(p, δ0)∩
Par(h) = {p} for each p ∈ Par(h). Note that this choice of δ0 implies the
following: if y ∈ B(p, δ0) ∩ Xm for some m ≥ 1, then maxm
j=1 d(hj(y), p) ≥ δ0.
if y ∈
Thus by (d), there is a constant δ > 0 with the following property:
B(p, δ) ∩ Xm for some m ≥ 1, then Dhm(y) ≥ K/K0.

Now for each p ∈ Par(h), ﬁx a nice interval Ap ∋ p such that Ap ⊂ B(p, δ).
Given x ∈ Xn with n ≥ 1, we shall estimate Dhn(x) from below. Let
p = f n(x).

Case 1. Assume that there exists 0 ≤ j < n such that y := hj(x) ∈
B(p, δ). Then y ∈ Xn−j ∩ B(p, δ) and hence Dhn−j(x) ≥ K/K0. By (b), it
follows that Dhn(x) ≥ K0Dhn−j(y) ≥ K.

Case 2. Assume now that hj(x) 6∈ B(p, δ) for all 0 ≤ j < n. Then n is
the ﬁrst entry time of x into Ap. Let J be the component of h−n(Ap) which
contains x. Then J, h(J), . . . , hn−1(J) are pairwise disjoint. By Lemma 3.1,
Dhn(x) ≥ e−C0|Ap|/|J|. Provided that n is large enough, |J| is small so that
Dhn(x) ≥ K.

4 Parabolic external maps

In this section we will prove Theorem 2.4, which relates parabolic external
maps to topologically expanding maps and to metrically expanding maps,
and which completes the theory of parabolic-like maps. We will start by
giving an introduction to parabolic-like maps. We will always assume the
degree d ≥ 2, if not speciﬁed otherwise.

4.1 Parabolic-like maps

The notion of parabolic-like maps is modeled on the notion of polynomial-
like maps and can be thought of as an extension of the later theory. A
polynomial-like map is an object which encodes the dynamics of a polynomial
on a neighborhood of its ﬁlled Julia set. We recall that the ﬁlled Julia set for a
polynomial is the complement of the basin of attraction of the superattracting
ﬁxed point ∞, and therefore the dynamics of a polynomial is expanding on
a neighborhood of its ﬁlled Julia set.

A (degree d) polynomial-like mapping is a (degree d) proper holomor-
phic map f : U ′ → U, where U ′, U ≈ D and U ′ ⊂ U. The ﬁlled Julia set
for a polynomial-like map (f, U ′, U) is the set of points which never leave
U ′ under iteration. Any polynomial-like map is associated with an external
map, which encodes the dynamics of the polynomial-like map outside of its
ﬁlled Julia set, so that a polynomial-like map is determined (up to holo-
morphic conjugacy) by its internal and external classes together with their
matching number in Z/(d − 1)Z. By replacing the external map of a degree
d polynomial-like map with the map z → zd (which is an external map of
a degree d polynomial) via surgery, Douady and Hubbard proved that any
degree d polynomial-like map can be straightend (this is, hybrid conjugate)
to a degree d polynomial (see [DH]).

On the other hand, in degree 2 a parabolic-like map is an object encoding
the dynamics of a member of the family PA(z) = z + 1/z + A ∈ P er1(1),
where A ∈ C, on a neighborhood of its ﬁlled Julia set KA. This family can
be characterized as the quadratic rational maps with a parabolic ﬁxed point
of multiplier 1 at ∞, and critical points at ±1. The ﬁlled Julia set KA of
PA is the complement of the parabolic basin of attraction of ∞. So on a
neighborhood of the ﬁlled Julia set KA of a map PA there exist an attracting
and a repelling direction.

A degree d parabolic-like map is a 4-tuple (f, U ′, U, γ) where U ′, U, U ∪
U ′, ≈ D, U ′ * U, f : U ′ → U is a degree d proper holomorphic map with a
parabolic ﬁxed point at z = z0 of multiplier 1, and with a forward invariant

13

arc γ : [−1, 1] → U , which we call dividing arc, emanating from z0 such that:

• γ is C 1 on [−1, 0] and on [0, 1], and γ(±1) ∈ ∂U,

• f (γ(t)) = γ(dt), ∀ − 1

d ≤ t ≤ 1

d, and γ([ 1

d , 1) ∪ (−1, − 1

d]) ⊆ U \ U ′,

• it divides U ′, U into Ω′, ∆′ and Ω, ∆ respectively, such that Ω′ ⊂⊂ U

(and Ω′ ⊂ Ω) and f : ∆′ → ∆ is an isomorphism.

The ﬁlled Julia set is deﬁned in the parabolic-like case to be the set of points
which do not escape Ω′ ∪ γ under iteration. As for polynomial-like maps,
any parabolic-like map is associated with an external map (see [L]), so that
a parabolic-like map is determined (up to holomorphic conjugacy) by its
internal and external classes. By replacing the external map of a degree 2
parabolic-like map with the map h2(z) = z2+1/3
z2/3+1, (which is an external map
of any member of the family P er1(1)(z) = {[PA]|PA(z) = z + 1/z + A}, as
shown in [L]) one can prove that any degree 2 parabolic-like map is hybrid
equivalent to a member of the family P er1(1) (see [L]).

The notion of parabolic-like map can be generalized to objects with a
ﬁnite number of parabolic cycles. More precisely, let us call simply parabolic-
like maps the objects deﬁned before, which have a unique parabolic ﬁxed
point. Then a parabolic-like map is a 4-tuple (f, U ′, U, γ) where U ′, U, U ∪
U ′, ≈ D, U ′ * U, f : U ′ → U is a degree d proper holomorphic map with
a ﬁnite set P ar(f ) of parabolic points p of multiplier 1, such that for all
p ∈ P ar(h) there exists a dividing arc γp ⊂ U , p ∈ γp, smooth except at p,

γ =Sp γp, and such that:

• for p 6= p′, γp ∩ γp′ = ∅ and f : γp ∩ U ′ → γf (p) is a diﬀeomorphism,

• it divides U and U ′ in Ωp, ∆p and Ω′

p, ∆′

p respectively, all connected,

and such that f : ∆′

p → ∆f (p) is an isomorphism and Ω′

p ⊂ Ωp,

• calling Ω =Tp Ωp and Ω′ =Tp Ω′

p, we have Ω′ ⊂⊂ U.

The ﬁlled Julia set for a parabolic-like map (f, U ′, U, γ) is (again) the set of
points that never leave Ω′ ∪ γ under iteration.

4.2 External maps for parabolic-like maps

The construction of an external map for a simply parabolic-like map (f, U ′, U, γ)
with connected ﬁlled Julia set Kf is relatively easy, and it shows that this

map belongs to Pd. Indeed consider the Riemann map α : bC \ Kf → bC \ D,

normalized by ﬁxing inﬁnity and by setting α(γ(t)) → 1 as t → 0. Setting

14

W+ = α(U \ Kf ) and W ′
+ = α(U ′ \ Kf ), we can deﬁne a degree d covering
h+ := α ◦ f ◦ α−1 : W ′
+ → W+, reﬂect the sets and the map with respect
to the unit circle, and the restriction to the unit circle h : S1 → S1 is an
external map for f . An external map for a parabolic-like map is deﬁned
up to real-analytic diﬀeomorphism. From the construction it is clear that
h ∈ Pd,1. The construction of an external map for a simply parabolic-like
map with disconnected ﬁlled Julia set is more elaborated (see [L]), and still
produces a map in Pd,1. Repeating the costructions handled in [L] for (gen-
eralized) parabolic-like maps, one can see that the external map for a degree
d parabolic-like map belongs to Pd.

On the other hand, it comes from the Straightening Theorem for parabolic-
like mappings (see [L]) that a map in Pd,1 is the external map for a parabolic-
like map (with a unique parabolic ﬁxed point) of same degree (and the proof
is analogous in case of several parabolics ﬁxed points and parabolic cycles).
While the space of external classes of polynomial-like mappings is easily
characterized as those circle coverings which are q-s.-conjugate to z 7→ zd for
some d ≥ 2, this is not the case for parabolic external classes. Theorem 2.4
gives a characterization for these maps.

4.3 Proof of Theorem 2.4

The main technical diﬃculty for proving Theorem 2.4 is to prove the following
property for maps in Md:

Lemma 4.1. For any h ∈ Md there is a map φ ∈ F1 such that the map ˇh :=
φ ◦ h ◦ φ−1 also belongs to Md and in addition for every orbit ˇp0, ˇp1, . . . ˇps =
ˇp0 ∈ Par( ˇH) say of parabolic multiplicity 2n, the power series developments
of ˇH : T → T at the points ˇpk, k ∈ Z/sZ, take the form

ˇH(x) = ˇpk+1 + (x − ˇpk)(1 + (x − ˇpk)2n · ˇP (x − ˇpk) + O(x − ˇpj)6n)

(2)

for some ﬁxed polynomial ˇP (i.e. ˇP depends on the cycle, but not on k) with
non-zero constant term and degree at most 4n − 1.

We will ﬁrst prove the Theorem assuming the Lemma. We prove Lemma

4.1 in Section 4.4. The following Proposition proves that Md ⊂ Pd.

Proposition 4.1. For every h ∈ Md there exists ǫ0 > 0 such that for every
0 < ǫ ≤ ǫ0 the map h has a holomorphic extension (h, W ′, W, γ) as a parabolic
external map with range W ⊆ {z : | log |z|| < ǫ}. In particular Md ⊂ Pd and
any map which is conjugate to h by φ ∈ F1 also belongs to Pd.

15

p : Ξ±

p ) ⊃ Ξ±

p and each Ξ±

Proof. It suﬃces to consider maps h ∈ Md satisfying the properties of ˇh in
the Lemma above. Also it suﬃces to work with the representative H : T → T
of h. Since H is a real analytic covering map it extends to a holomorphic
isomorphism H : V ′ → V between reﬂection symmetric neighborhoods of R
and satisfying H(z + 1) = H(z) + d. For each p ∈ P = E−1(Par(h)), choose a
pair of repelling Fatou cooordinates φ±
p → Hl := {z|ℜ(z) < 0} such that
each φ±
p+1 = φ±
p (x − 1).
Possibly restricting the φ±
p , with p ranging
h(p) and H s is univalent
over P , disjoint for each choice of sign, H(Ξ±
on Ξ±

p is symmetric with respect to R, and φ±
p we can suppose all the domains Ξ±

p , where s = sp denotes the period of E(p).
For each orbit in Par(h) choose a representative pi ∈ P , and call 2ni the
parabolic multiplicity of the orbit. Deﬁne Sǫ := {x + iy||y| < ǫ} for ǫ > 0.
For p in the orbit of pi, call Cp the double cone, symmetric with respect to
the real line, such that Cp ∩ R = {p} and the angle between R and ∂Cp

is 1/(16ni). Call Xǫ = Sǫ \Sp∈P Cp. By a compactness argument, since

DH(z) > 1 for z ∈ R ∩ Xǫ, and lim supz∈∂Xǫ,z→p |Arg(DH(z) − 1)| = π/4,
there exists an ǫ0 > 0 such that, for all z ∈ Xǫ0, ℜ(DH(z)) > 1. Possibly
decreasing ǫ0, we can assume that for all p, p′ ∈ P , Sǫ0 ∩ Cp ∩ Cp′ = ∅. Since h
p )−1(∓ai + R−) intersects
satisﬁes the conclusion of Lemma 4.1 the curves (φ±
the boundary of Cp at angle π/4 asymptotically as a → ∞ and moreover for
E(p) and E(p′) in the same orbit this happens asymptotically at the same
imaginary height. Thus possibly decreasing ǫ0 and ﬁxing any ǫ, 0 < ǫ < ǫ0
we may choose ai > 0 (depending on ǫ) such that for all i and all p with E(p)
p )−1(∓ai · i + R−) exits Xǫ through ∂Sǫ
in the orbit of E(pi) the arcs γ±
transversally.

(note that ˆX ′

ǫ ⊂ Xǫ), and ˆXǫ = Sǫ \Sp ∆H(p).

Then by construction H −1( ˆXǫ) ⊂ ˆX ′

ǫ and H −1( ˆXǫ) ⊂ Sǫ. Thus taking
W := exp(Sǫ), W ′ := h−1(W ) and the multi arc γ as the family exp(γp),
p ∈ P , we have constructed an extension (h, W ′, W, γ) of h in Pd.

ǫ = Sǫ \Sp ∆p

Lemma 4.2. The map hd is M¨obius conjugate to a map in Md, so hd ∈ Pd,1.

Proof. For 0 < r < 1 deﬁne Mr(z) = (z + r)/(1 + rz). Then |M ′
a monotone decreasing function of ℜ(z) with |M ′
and |M ′
hd = Mr(zd). Thus M −1

r(z)| is
r(−1)| = (1 + r)/(1 − r)
r(1)| = (1 − r)/(1 + r). Note that for r = (d − 1)/(d + 1) we have
r ◦ hd ◦ Mr = (Mr)d and this map evidently belongs

in [L] that the arcs γ1

is C 1 for z 6= p, is quasi-symmetric. Next extend φ as a diﬀeomorphism be-

Proposition 4.2. Pd ⊆ T ∗

d ∩ Fd = Td.

17

Proof. Let h ∈ Pd and let (h, W ′, W, γ) be a degree d holomorphic extension
of h as a parabolic external map with dividing multi arc γ and associated
sets ∆′ and ∆. We shall ﬁrst redeﬁne Ω and Ω′ so as to be τ -symmetric :
Ω = W \∆ ∪ τ (∆) and Ω′ = W ′ \∆′ ∪ τ (∆′) then Ω′′ := h−1(Ω) ⊂ Ω′ ( Ω. It
follows that each p ∈ Par(h), say of period n, is admits the circle as repelling
directions. Indeed if not then it would have a τ -symmetric attracting petal
along S1 to one or both sides. However since Ω′′ ⊂ Ω the parabolic basin for
hn containing such a petal would be a proper basin and thus would contain
a critical point.

To prove that all other periodic orbits are repelling, let ρ denote the
hyperbolic metric on Ω. Then each connected component V of Ω′′ is a subset
of U ∩ W ′ for some connected component U of Ω. Thus h is expanding with
respect to the conformal metric ρ. Since any non parabolic orbit is contained
in Ω′′ ∩ S1 it follows that all non parabolic orbits are repelling. This proves
the ﬁrst inclusion. The equality sign is immediate from Corollary 2.2.

Completion of proof of Theorem 2.4: By Proposition 4.1, Md ⊂ Pd (and
so Md,1 ⊂ Pd,1), and by Proposition 4.2, Pd ⊆ Td. Since hd is topologi-
cally expanding we have that Hd,1 ⊂ Td,1, and combining Lemma 4.2 and
Proposition 4.1 we obtain Pd,1 ⊂ Hd,1. So:

Md ⊂ Pd ⊂ Td

and Md,1 ⊂ Pd,1 ⊂ Hd,1 ⊂ Td,1

By Theorem 2.1, any h ∈ Td is real analytically conjugate to a mapbh ∈ Md,

and so by Proposition 4.1 we also have h ∈ Pd. So we obtain

Pd = Td

and

πd(Md) = πd(Pd) = πd(Td).

4.4 Proof of Lemma 4.1

This section is completely devoted to proving Lemma 4.1. Let us start by
noticing that it follows from the deﬁnition of Md that h only has ﬁnitely
many parabolic points. The proof of Lemma 4.1 uses the idea of the proof
of Corollary 3.2 to recursively construct conjugacies to maps which full-ﬁlls
the requirements of ˇH to higher and higher orders. It turns out that after
two steps of the recursion we arrive at the desired map ˇH and obtain the
conjugacy as the composition of the pair of conjugacies from the recursion.

The recursion is given by the following procedure:

Let h ∈ Md be arbitrary, let N = Nh denote the least common multiple of the
periods of parabolic orbits for h and let L := (dN − 1)/(d − 1). Deﬁne a real
analytic diﬀeomorphism φ : R −→ R and a new real analytic diﬀeomorphism

bpk = φ(pk) = bH k(bp), then ps+k − pk = bps+k −bpk ∈ Z for each k ≥ 0.

Let 2n > 0 denote the common parabolic degeneracy. A priori the power
series developments (Taylor expansions) of H around the points pk could
have non-linear terms of order less than 2n + 1. However, since h ∈ Md the
leading non-linear term must be of odd order, say 2m + 1 (and have positive
coeﬃcient), and Claim 4.1 implies m = n.

the points pk take the form

H(x) = pk+1 + (x − pk)(1 + (x − pk)2m · Pk(x − pk) + O(x − pk)4m),

where Pk is a polynomial of degree at most (2m − 1), Ps+k = Pk for k ≥ 0
and where Pk(0) > 0 for at least one k, 0 ≤ k < s. Then for each k the

Taylor approximation to order 4m of bH at bpk takes the form
bH(bx) =bpk+1 + (bx −bpk)(1 + (bx −bpk)2m · bP (bx −bpk) + O(bx −bpk)4m),

Let us ﬁrst see that the Claim implies m = n. Since H and bH are
analytically conjugate the parabolic degeneracy of bH atbp is also 2n. However
one of them is positive, it follows from (5) that the constant term of bP is

since the coeﬃcient of the leading terms in (4) are non-negative and at least

positive and then from (6) that the degeneracy is 2m. Therefore m = n.

Proof. Towards a proof of the Claim a routine computation and induction
shows that for all j ≥ 0 the Taylor series of H j to order 4m at pk is given by:

H j(x) = H j(pk) + (x − pk)(1 + (x − pk)2m ·

Pl+k(x − pk) + O(x − pk)4m)

j−1Xl=0

and thus with Qk := (2m + 1)Pk + x · P ′

k = Qs+k

(H j)′(x) = 1 + (x − pk)2m ·

j−1Xl=0

Ql+k(x − pk) + O(x − pk)4m.

(3) and using (H 0)′ ≡ 1, (H j)′ − 1 = O((x − pk)2m) we ﬁnd

From the formula for φ we ﬁnd the expansion of φ to order 2m at pk :

φ(x) =bpk +

(x − pk)(1 + O(x − pk)2m)

so that the expansion for φ−1 to order 2m at bpk is:
φ−1(bx) = pk + L(bx −bpk)(1 + O(bx −bpk)2m)
and thus the expansion for bH ′ to order (4m − 1) at bpk is:
(L(bx −bpk))2m
So by integration frombpk we ﬁnd
bH(bx) =bpk+1 +(bx−bpk)(1+(bx−bpk)2m L2m

Claim 4.2. Suppose the Taylor expansions of H around the points pk take
the form

H(x) = pk+1+(x−pk)(1+(x−pk)2n·P (x−pk)+(x−pk)4n·Rk(x−pk)+O(x−pk)6n),

where P and Rk are polynomials of degree at most (2n − 1), P with P (0) > 0
is independent of k and Rs+k = Rk for k ≥ 0. Then for each k the Taylor

expansion of bH to order 6n at bpk takes the form
bH(bx) =bpk+1+(bx−bpk)(1+(bx−bpk)2n·bP (bx−bpk)+(bx−bpk)4n·bR(bx−bpk)+O(bx−bpk)6n),
where bR and bP (x) = L2nP (Lx) with bP (0) > 0 are polynomials of degree at
most 2n − 1 and are independent of the point in the orbit of bp = φ(p).

Proof. The proof of this Claim is similar to the proof of the ﬁrst Claim, and
we only indicate the diﬀerences.
For proving a formula for the j-th iterate the following formula is simple and
useful

(8)

P (x(1 + x2nP (x))) = P (x) + x2n · x · P ′(x) · P (x) + O(x)4n

(9)

(Note that the term x2n · x · P ′(x) · P (x) contains terms of order larger than
or equal 4n, but taking them out only complicates the formula.)

By induction for each j ≥ 1 and x close to pk we ﬁnd

H j(x) = pj+k + (x − pk)(1 + (x − pk)2n · j · P (x − pk)

((2n + 1)(P (x))2 + xP ′(x)P (x)))

is independent of k, i.e. independent of the starting point in the orbit of
p. As above deﬁne Q by the formula x2nQ(x) := d
dx (x2n+1P (x)), and thus
Q(x) = (2n+1)P +x·P ′, and Sk by the formula x4nSk(x) := d
dx(x4n+1Rk(x)),
and thus Sk(x) = (4n + 1)Rk + x · R′

k = Ss+k(x). Then

(H j))′(x) = F ′

From the deﬁnition of φ and (10) we see that φ is independent of k to
order 4n and thus the same holds for φ−1. Combining this with the above

shows that bH ′ is independent of k to order 6n − 1 and thus bH is independent

of k up to and including order 6n, as promised by the Claim.
