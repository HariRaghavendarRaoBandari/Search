MODELING THE BEHAVIOR OF SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO

FOR REPEATED ‘SNAPSHOT’ IMAGING

Abstract. For imaging of static object by the means of sequential repeated
independent measurements, a theoretical modeling of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)’s
behavior with varying number of measurement is developed, based on the in-
formation capacity of optical imaging systems. Experimental veritiﬁcation of
imaging using pseudo-thermal light source is implemented, for both the direct
average of multiple measurements, and the image reconstructed by second or-
der ﬂuctuation correlation (SFC) which is closely related to ghost imaging.
Successful curve ﬁtting of data measured under diﬀerent conditions veriﬁes
the model.

In order to obtain a high quality image of a static object with low luminance,
extension of the total measurement time is the usual solution, which can also depress
the inﬂuence induced by short-period ﬂuctuations on the light path. However, long
exposure time imaging puts forward high requirements on the stability, noise level,
and, in particular the dynamic range of the detector. Since a typical digital camera
usually provides only 8 bits (256 levels) gray scale, long exposure time will easily
lead to saturation for the pixels in the bright part while other pixels remain too
dark to get enough illumination to form eﬀective counts, thus lose a lot information
in vain and suﬀer a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (see, e.g., [1] pp. 1). As an
alternative, imaging method using repeated ‘snapshot’ measurements with duration
short enough to avoid any pixel to be overexposed during each measurement, and
total number large enough to accumulate eﬀective luminance for the less-exposed
parts to be recognized, is introduced instead of a single measurement with long
time exposure, and has been proven to be useful to maintain a high SNR using
detectors of relatively small dynamic range ([1] pp. 148).
It is not diﬃcult to
imagine that the imaging SNR grows with increasing measurement number. At
the same time, there will be an upper limit of SNR, considering the intrinsic noise
level and imperfections of the imaging system, which means the imaging quality
will not improve anymore even taking more snapshots. Naturally, one will expect
a tradeoﬀ between the measurement number and SNR. Theoretical modeling and
quantitative analysis of SNR’s behavior versus measurement number will provide
much convenience for practical applications, e.g., prediction of ultimate SNR, and
optimization of necessary measurement numbers. However, no such modeling has
been presented so far.

On the other hand, ghost imaging (GI), which enables spatial-resolved image
reconstruction with correlation of a single-pixel ‘bucket’ signal and the contactless

spatial record of, either the other split beam from the same light source [2], or
the spatial modulation pattern applied to the illumination beam [3]. Neither the
bucket signal nor the contactless spatial record contains full information of the
object’s spatial distribution alone, yet the image can be reconstructed with the two
parts in combine, which is the very meaning of the name ‘ghost’. GI is essentially a
repeated snapshot imaging process, and suﬀers from the huge number of repeated
measurements required to achieve acceptable SNR. Though the compressive sensing
technique could use fewer measurements with the cost of increasing calculations
[4], the number of measurement is still too high for practical applications. While
diﬀerent aspects have been studied on SNR of GI [5, 6, 7], quantitative analysis of
the relation between SNR and the number of measurement is yet to be done.

Despite the argument on the underlying physics [8, 9], it is well accepted that
the second order correlation plays an essential part in GI. Considering the identity
of the two split beams used in traditional GI, second order auto-correlation of
one beam should share the same merit of the cross correlation between the split
beams from the same light source. Although the two characteristic properties of
GI – ‘ghost’ and super resolution – have been demonstrated by one-beam auto-
correlation experiments [10, 11], which shows that analysis on the second order auto-
correlation should also apply to cross-correlation based GI, it has been pointed out
that only the second order ﬂuctuation correlation shares the exact same mechanism
with GI [12].

In this Letter, we model the behavior of SNR for repeated ‘snapshot’ measure-
ment from the perspective of information capacity of imaging systems. Rather than
the commonly used invariance theorem [13, 14], phenomenological modiﬁcations in-
spired by Boltzmann entropy are made, corresponding to the speciﬁc process we
investigate. Similar experiment setup with [11] is implemented to test the model,
using commercial CMOS camera to capture the snapshots of static object illu-
minated by pseudo-thermal light. Successful ﬁtting of measured SNR behavior
validates our model, not only for direct image, but also for the image reconstructed
by the second order ﬂuctuation correlation, which suggests the model’s capability
for GI.

The information capacity for imaging system originates from the time-bandwidth
product (sampling time T times bandwidth BT ) in signal processing theory, and
its correspondence in spatial domain - space-bandwidth product (sampling length
Li times spatial bandwidth in that direction Bi, i = x, y) in optical imaging theory
(see, e.g., [15] pp. 27). They represent the minimum number of samples required for
the signal to be properly sampled in temporal/spatial domain. These two kinds of
products were originally believed to be independently invariant for measurements
under diﬀerent parameter settings using the same 2D imaging system, however,
later study on superresolution imaging shows that it is, in essence, the number of
degrees of freedom NF = 2 (1 + 2LxBx) (1 + 2LyBy) (1 + 2T BT ), the combination
of temporal and spatial products, that is a constant [13, 14]. Later on, the de-
tected noise in imaging system is taken into account, and a new invariant named

MODELING THE BEHAVIOR OF SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO FOR REPEATED ‘SNAPSHOT’ IMAGING3

‘information capacity’ C is introduced, namely,[14]

(0.1)

n (cid:19)1/2#NF
C = log"(cid:18) s + n
= (1 + 2T BT ) Yi=x,y

(1 + 2LiBi) × log (1 + SNR) ,

where s and n represent the intensity of the detected signal and noise, respectively,
and the signal-to-noise ratio SNR = s/n. C should be invariant for any one-time
measurement under diﬀerent parameter settings conducted by a particular imaging
system.

Instead of applying in repeated snapshot measurement process directly, the un-
derlying signiﬁcance of Eq. (0.1) should be examined ﬁrst. In fact, C can be seen
as an analogue of Boltzmann entropy S = kB log Ω in thermal dynamics, which is
proportional to the logarithm of Ω, the total number of possible states. Square root
of the intensity ratio (s + n)/n is the average number of states the measurement
can distinguish at one sample point, in the sense of the joint space-time, with NF
being the total number of sample points. For an imaging process, the information
capacity C tells the amount of the objects unknown information after the image
has been generated. In other words, C indicates, besides the information revealed
by the image, the amount of the uncertainty the system can hold after the imaging
process.

As for the repeated snapshot measurement of a static object under stationary and
ergodic light source, the situation is slightly diﬀerent. The ﬁnal reconstructed im-
age is built on sequential repeated measurements with identical parameter setting.
Each measurement reveals some information about the object, and the systems
uncertainty is reduced. That is to say, instead of being invariant, the information
capacity decreases with the growing number of involving measurements (see, e.g.,
[4]). If the time separation between the neighboring measurements is larger than the
coherence time of the light source, which is often the case, and that since the same
static object is illuminated by a stationary and ergodic light, the information of the
object revealed by diﬀerent measurements can be seen as independent identically
distributed (i.i.d.). Then, in the sense of average, contribution from each measure-
ment will cost the same amount of decrease in information capacity C. Therefore,
for a repeated snapshot measurement built by N measurements, each containing
information m in average, the information capacity C of the system becomes

(0.2)

C = C0 − N m,

where C0 is the informational uncertainty of the system before the ﬁrst measure-
ment.

The term (1 + SNR) in Eq. (0.1) should be reconsidered for the repeated snap-
shot measurement process. This part should be the number of possible diﬀerent
states which can be distinguished by the system at one sampling point, or to say,
the unknown information of the object which has not been revealed by the image
yet. As for an imaging process, it has been known that the rightful form of SNR is
diﬀerent from the usual way used in signal processing [16]. Therefore, the meaning
of ‘signal’ and ‘noise’ should be redeﬁned. A usual way is to take the image plane
average of an ideal image of the object O (x, y) (x, y are coordinates of the image
plane) as the ‘signal’, which stands for a measure of the amount of information

4JUNHUI LI1, BIN LUO2, DONGYUE YANG3, GUOHUA WU3, LONGFEI YIN1, AND HONG GUO1

contained in the imaging process, and treat the standard derivation of the actual
reconstructed image R (x, y) from O (x, y) as an estimation of the ‘noise’. In this
way, SNR reads

(0.3)

SNR =

hO (x, y)i(x,y)

,

D(R (x, y) − O (x, y))2E1/2

(x,y)

which stands for the number of states distinguishable due to the variance of the
reconstructed image diﬀering from the object. Unlike that in Eq. (0.1), SNR in Eq.
(0.3) gives the amount of the systems known information revealed by the image.
Therefore, the number of possible states at one sampling point unrevealed in the
reconstructed image should have the form of (Ω0 − SNR), in which Ω0 stands for
the number of possible states before imaging. If the measurement parameters of
the spatial domain are unchanged for all the measurements, the spatial part of Eq.
(0.1) can be seen as a constant, i.e., (1 + 2LxBx) (1 + 2LyBy) = 1/A. Substituting
Eq. (0.2) into Eq. (0.1) with (Ω0 − SNR) replacing (1 + SNR) yields

(0.4)

SNR = Ω0 − eC0 exp(cid:18)−

Am

1 + 2T BT

N(cid:19) .

Eq. (0.4) indicates that SNR evolves negative-exponentially with the growth of
the measurement number N .
It converges to an upper limit Ω0 when N → ∞,
and all the systems information have been revealed. The growing speed of SNR
is ever-decreasing, with a converge constant k = (2T BT + 1)/(Am), the number
of measurement required for SNR to fulﬁll 1/e of the total growth from 0 to Ω0,
denoting the speed of converge.

An experiment is implemented to test the model. As shown in Figure 1, light
from a 532 nm semiconductor laser (Ceo DPSSL-532U, with power less than 32 mW
and linewidth less than 0.1 MHz) passing through a 4 rpm rotating ground glass
plate (Edmund 100 mm diameter 220 grit) makes a pseudo thermal source with
about 30 ms coherence time (which is smaller than 40 ms – the time separation
between neighboring measurements, to make sure that the snapshots are indepen-
dent). This pseudo-thermal light illuminates a static ‘GI’ pattern object of 3 mm
square size (which is much bigger than the coherence length of the light source
on the object plane – 0.02 mm). A imaging lens with 100 mm focus length forms
an image on a commercial 8-bit CMOS camera (Thorlabs DCC 3240C, minimum
exposure 0.009 ms), illuminates about 100 × 100 pixels. Within each short duration
snapshot, when the laser outputs its maximum power, speckles generated by the
ground glass grits can be recognized clearly from the image, which suggests the ex-
istence of short-period ﬂuctuations. Repeated snapshots under diﬀerent exposure
time and laser power are recorded. Direct image is simply the average of all the
snapshots. Image reconstructed by the second order ﬂuctuation auto-correlation is
calculated from

(0.5)

R (x, y) ∝

h[i (x, y; t) − hi (x, y; t)it] × [I (t) − hI (t)it]it

hi (x, y; t)ithI (t)it

,

where i (x, y; t) and I (t) =Px,y i (x, y; t) are the spatial record and total count of

the snapshot captured at time t, respectively. The area of interest (AOI) of each
snapshot is set to be 160 × 160 pixels with ﬁxed coordinates, larger than the size
of the image in the center. The ground glass is taken away to get an ideal image

MODELING THE BEHAVIOR OF SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO FOR REPEATED ‘SNAPSHOT’ IMAGING5

without ﬂuctuation from direct illumination of high power laser under suﬃciently
long exposure time. After setting a threshold to binarize the ideal image, then
being adjusted into the same size of R (x, y), and being aligned with the center of
R (x, y), SNR is calculated by Eq. (0.3).

Measured SNR upon varying measurement number N are shown in Figure 2,
both for direct imaging (DI) and second order ﬂuctuation auto-correlation (SFC).
While data under other settings are also collected but not shown, only the two
extreme condition with respect to two parameters, i.e., light power and exposure
time, are given in Figure 2. They all ﬁt Eq. (0.4) well, as shown in Table 1, that
each has a close-to-unity adjusted R squared coeﬃcient (see, e.g., [17]). The range
of exposure time is more than 50, and the large light power is about 10 times of
the small one. Therefore, as for the average number of photons registered by the
camera during each snapshot, our model validates for the range of at least two and
a half magnitudes, for both direct imaging and image reconstructed by the second
order ﬂuctuation correlation.

The only exception is the SNR of direct imaging in the strong luminance case
(31.6 mW bright laser illumination under 0.5 ms long exposure), which seems to
be a constant with growing N .
It suggests that the converging process ﬁnishes
within 20 snapshots, which is the smallest measurement number in our experiment.
On the other hand, relatively large error bars when N is small (less than 100) for
the weak luminance case shows large ﬂuctuations exist because there has not been
suﬃciently many photons registered to form a stable image.

The only assumption during the whole derivation of Eq. (0.4) is that the snap-
shots are i.i.d.. To check whether this assumption is fulﬁlled, total count’s variance
∆i is plotted versus the measurement number N , as Figure 3 shows.

surement number N by power function ∆i = aN b.

A power function ∆i = aN b is used to ﬁt the data points in Figure 3. The results
are demonstrated in Table 2. For a classical independent identically distributed
random variable, the power law b should approach −0.5 when N → ∞, as what the
central limit theorem points out, while for quantum process with strong correlation,
b can even approach −1. Although the weak luminace case (3.16 mW laser under
0.009 ms exposure) stays in the classical regime, the other one with high power
laser and long time exposure exceeds the classical limit b = −0.5. This observation
reveals an interesting paradox, that the ∆i − N relation seems to contradict the
i.i.d assumption. Meanwhile, it is this very assumption that leads to Eq. (0.4),
which shows high consistency with measured SNR. Further investigation is needed
to clarify this paradox.

It should be noted that, though ﬁtting the measured data quite well, Eq. (0.4)
is, to some extent, a phenomenological formula. The validity regime of Eq. (0.4)
could be given by testifying more cases using diﬀerent setups with all kinds of light
sources and diﬀerent setups.Investigation on each parameter’s inﬂuence in Eq. (0.4)
will be meaningful. Although the second order ﬂuctuation auto-correlation in this
Letter shares the same formula with real GI (Eq. (0.5)), and it is fair to say our
model should also be suitable for GI, experiment veriﬁcation is still necessary.

In conclusion, based on the theory of information capacity for imaging system,
we study the repeated ‘snapshot’ measurement imaging process. A model for the
relation between SNR and the number of measurement is developed, which shows
the increasing converge behavior of SNR with growing measurement number cor-
rectly and ﬁts experiments of both direct imaging and second order ﬂuctuation
auto-correlation with high accuracy. This model may suit for any repeated, identi-
cal, yet independent sampling on static object.
