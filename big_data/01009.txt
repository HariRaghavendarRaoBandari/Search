Analysis of terrestrial planet formation by the Grand Tack model: System

architecture and tack location

R. Brasser1, S. Matsumura2, S. Ida1, S. J. Mojzsis3,4, S. C. Werner5

ABSTRACT

The Grand Tack model of terrestrial planet formation has emerged in recent years
as the premier scenario used to account for several observed features of the inner solar
system. It relies on early migration of the giant planets to gravitationally sculpt and
mix the planetesimal disc down to ∼1 AU, after which the terrestrial planets accrete
from material left in a narrow circum-solar annulus. Here we have investigated how
the model fares under a range of initial conditions and migration course-change (‘tack’)
locations. We have run a large number of N-body simulations with a tack location of
1.5 AU and 2 AU and tested initial conditions using equal mass planetary embryos and
a semi-analytical approach to oligarchic growth. We make use of a recent model of the
protosolar disc that takes account of viscous heating, include the full eﬀect of type 1
migration, and employ a realistic mass-radius relation for the growing terrestrial planets.
Results show that the canonical tack location of Jupiter at 1.5 AU is inconsistent with
the most massive planet residing at 1 AU at greater than 95% conﬁdence. This favours
a tack farther out at 2 AU for the disc model and parameters employed. Of the diﬀerent
initial conditions, we ﬁnd that the oligarchic case is capable of statistically reproducing
the orbital architecture and mass distribution of the terrestrial planets, while the equal
mass embryo case is not.

Introduction

A successful physical model for the formation of the terrestrial planets is a long-standing prob-
lem (Tsiganis 2015). The ﬁrst physically plausible idea came from Safronov (1969) who suggested
the earliest stage of accumulation of dust into larger bodies was caused by gravitational instability

in a thin dust layer. Safronov (1969) showed that relative velocities between bodies are of the order
of their escape velocity, so the largest body’s gravitational cross section is limited by the geomet-
rical one, limiting growth. These ﬁndings were later used by Wetherill (1980), who showed the
terrestrial planets coagulated from planetesimals, and that the formation of the these planets was
linked with the evolution of the asteroid belt. Wetherill & Stewart (1989) elaborated that in a disc
of planetesimals some would undergo runaway growth and form a sequence of planetary embryos.
These embryos would then further collide to form the terrestrial planets.

These ideas were ﬁrst rigorously tested by Kokubo & Ida (1996) who performed numerical
simulations of a self-gravitating disc of planetesimals. They discovered that some objects in the
disc underwent runaway growth, as was predicted, which resulted in a mixed population of proto-
planets and planetesimals (Kokubo & Ida 1998). The protoplanets underwent so-called oligarchic
growth: all would be roughly equally spaced and be of similar mass as each vied for supremacy
in accreting the last remaining planetesimals. The protoplanets (also dubbed ‘planetary embryos’)
subsequently collide to form the terrestrial planets (Chambers 2001).

Early simulations of terrestrial planet formation yielded estimates for a growth time scale of
several tens of millions of years and overall results that showed the ﬁnal terrestrial system would
be assembled by 100 Myr (Chambers 2001). Most of these early simulated systems, however, were
found to suﬀer from an excess eccentricity and inclination of the ﬁnal planets, but the inclusion of
a large number of planetesimals to exert dynamical friction alleviated this concern (O’Brien et al.
2006). A further chronic and fundamental shortcoming with earlier simulations was that the out-
put systematically yielded a far too massive Mars analogue. This predicament led Raymond et al.
(2009) to investigate how the mass of Mars might depend on the orbital conﬁguration of the gi-
ant planets.
It was found that only the current spacing of the gas giants led to the capability
of the model to produce a Mars analogue much less massive than Earth, but under the special
condition that the eccentricities of the gas giants were higher than their current values. As such,
Raymond et al. (2009) highlighted the unrealistic nature of the initial conditions required to ex-
plain Mars’ low mass, and left the problem as a lingering impasse to be solved later.

A potential solution presented itself in the work of Hansen (2009), who studied terrestrial
planet formation with planetary embryos situated in a narrow annulus between 0.7 AU and 1 AU
from the Sun. These initial conditions nicely reproduced the mass-semimajor axis relationship we
have today, with two relatively large terrestrial-type planets book-ended by two much less massive
ones. The main drawback of that study was that no mechanism was presented to gravitationally
truncate the outer edge of the solid disc near 1 AU. The same could be said for the inner edge, so
that no mechanism existed to create such a high-density, narrow annulus with which to explain the
terrestrial worlds.

This quandary led Walsh et al. (2011) to propose the so-called Grand Tack scenario, wherein

– 3 –

the early gas-driven coupled migration of Jupiter and Saturn sculpts the planetesimal disc and
truncates it near 1 AU. The Grand Tack at least partially explains the formation of a high density
region in the inner disc, although it cannot explain the existence of an inner cavity inside of roughly
0.7 AU. The inclusion of this scenario leads to a broad outline of how the early solar system evolved:
First, Jupiter is assumed to form before Saturn, clear the gas in an annulus the width of which is
comparable to its Hill radius, and undergo inward Type 2 migration (Lin & Papaloizou 1986). The
inward migration of Jupiter shepherds material towards the inner portion of the disc while also scat-
tering other material outwards, to create an enhanced density region for terrestrial planet formation
and that mixes planetesimals from the innermost and outer portions of the protoplanetary disc.
Once Saturn grows to about half its current mass (Masset & Casoli 2009), it is assumed to partially
clear the disc in its vicinity, migrate rapidly at ﬁrst to catch up with Jupiter, and subsequently get
trapped in a mean-motion resonance near Jupiter, presumably the 2:3 (Masset & Snellgrove 2001;
Pierens & Raymond 2011) but it may also have been the 2:1 (Pierens et al. 2014). In this process,
these two giant planets clear the disc together. The torque from the interaction with the disc is
stronger for a shorter separation between the planet and the disc edge. Since Jupiter and Saturn
are interacting and Jupiter is more massive, it is reasonable to think that Saturn is pushed out-
wards by Jupiter’s perturbation, and the separation from the disc edge is smaller for Saturn than
for Jupiter. Thus the torque on Saturn can be larger in spite of lower mass. The interaction with
Jupiter prevents Saturn from creating a cleared annulus in the disc and gas from the outer disc ﬂows
past Saturn into the inner disc. If the gap-crossing disc gas ﬂow is large enough, the Jupiter-Saturn
pair can migrate outwards (Masset & Snellgrove 2001; Pierens & Nelson 2008). Consequently, the
planets reverse their migration: they tack as a sail boat would change its direction by steering
into and through the wind. Once the giant planets have completed this early migration phase,
have left the inner solar system and settled in the vicinity of their present positions, terrestrial
planet formation could proceed as before, but only (as advocated by Hansen (2009)) from material
in a narrow circum-solar annulus. In this manner Walsh et al. (2011) successfully reproduced the
mass-semimajor axis distribution of the inner planets if the reversal of Jupiter occurred at 1.5 AU
because they truncated the inner edge of their planetesimal disc at 0.5 AU. A successful feature of
their model is that it also accounts for the apparent compositional diﬀerences across the asteroid
belt (DeMeo & Carry 2014).

It is worth noting, however, that this step wise reconstruction of the early evolution of the
planetary system has some pitfalls of varying severity. For example, the particular conﬁguration
and outward migration of the giant planets favoured by the Grand Tack is only supported for a
narrow set of initial conditions (D’Angelo & Marzari 2012) and is not universal (Zhang & Zhou
2010). There may also be other pathways to produce such a high density region through a deﬁcit of
material near Mars (Izidoro et al. 2014), although this idea was recently undermined in a follow-up
study (Izidoro et al. 2015). Lastly, up to this point the Grand Tack fails to reproduce the current
mass and location of Mercury, most likely because dynamical models always truncate the disc near
0.5 AU or beyond. Clearly further study is needed in both the gas-driven evolution of the giant

– 4 –

planets and the subsequent formation and evolution of the terrestrial planets to explain what we
see in our own solar system.

With this in mind, we sought to scrutinise the Grand Tack model and its consequences over
most of the age of the solar system, by running a large number of Grand Tack simulations with a
range of initial conditions and varying tack locations. Our work also include d several dynamical
eﬀects that have hitherto been ignored. We report on the various methods that were employed to
quantify whether or not Grand Tack successfully reproduces the observed dynamical features of the
inner solar system and whether one set of initial conditions and tack location is more favourable
than another.

This report is organised as follows. In Section 2 we introduce several additions to the original
Grand Tack simulations of Walsh et al. (2011) and justify our choice of disc model and the inclu-
sion of type 1 migration. Section 3 describes our initial conditions, while Section 4 describes our
numerical methods. Section 5 explains our criteria for a set of simulations to successfully reproduce
the current observed dynamical properties of the inner solar system. This is followed by Sections 6
and Section 7 where we describe the results of our numerical simulations. Section 8 is reserved for
a discussion, and we draw our conclusions in Section 9.

2. Deviations from the original Grand Tack model

In addition to the simple reproduction of the Grand Tack scenario, for this study we also chose
to employ a substantially diﬀerent model for the protoplanetary disc than that used by Walsh et al.
(2011). An explanation for this choice is provided below. We have also included the eﬀect of type
1 embryo migration.

2.1. Protoplanetary disc

Walsh et al. (2011) employed the protoplanetary disc model of Morbidelli & Crida (2007),
which in turn was based on the work of Guillot & Hueso (2006). The surface density of their
disc proﬁle is of the form Σ(r) = Σ0 exp(−r2/R2), where R ∼ 200 AU is a scaling constant.
This Gaussian proﬁle of the surface density is markedly diﬀerent from the oft-employed power
law slopes found elsewhere in the literature e.g. Hartmann et al. (1998). The scaling constant
at 1 AU is Σ0 = 100 g cm−2, which is much lower than the usual value of 1700–2400 g cm−2
(Hayashi 1981). Since the disc model of Morbidelli & Crida (2007) is not widely used and relies
on a constant viscosity, ν, rather than a constant α-viscosity, we decided to make use of the disc
model of Bitsch et al. (2015), which is based on the study by Hartmann et al. (1998). Bitsch et al.
(2015) give ﬁtting formulae to compute the disc’s surface density, temperature and scale height as
a function of both heliocentric distance and time. Initially the disc’s gas surface density at 1 AU is
2272 g cm−2 and the temperature is 576 K in the midplane so that the scale height at 1 AU is about
0.057 AU and the metallicity is equal to the solar value. This is higher than most traditional models

– 5 –

have assumed and the higher temperature is caused by viscous heating. These ﬁtting formulae are
valid, however, as long as any embedded planet is not massive enough to signiﬁcantly alter the disc
structure, such as opening an annulus, and as long as the disc remains mostly unperturbed. This
latter requirement may not be entirely true because of the proximity of Jupiter, whose presence
imposes a change in the disc’s surface density and temperature. For a radiative disc, this change
in the temperature proﬁle will result in a change in the disc surface density, but for a viscous disc,
which is the region we work in, this eﬀect is less severe. Besides, a much lower disc temperature,
caused by the inﬂuence of Jupiter, would mean that the ice line is close to 1 AU very early on,
which is inconsistent with solar system formation (Matsumura et al. 2016). Here we adopt the
disc of Bitsch et al. (2015) and set the α viscosity equal to 0.005, use a solar metallicity and a
molecular weight of the gas of 2.3 amu (Bitsch et al. 2015). The gas surface density scales as
Σ(r) ∝ r−α and the temperature proﬁle is T (r) ∝ r−β, where α = 1/2 and β = 6/7. These power
law relations are accurate out to ∼5 AU, which is the region we are interested in, so we adopted
these proﬁles throughout the disc. In Fig. 1 we plotted the evolution of the surface density (top)
and the temperature bottom as a function of time and distance to the Sun. There is a very rapid
decay for the ﬁrst 1 Myr and a slower decay after that. After 5 Myr we photo-evaporate the disc
away over the next 100 kyr.

2.2. Embryo migration

Although Walsh et al. (2011) decided not to include the eﬀect of type 1 migration (Tanaka et al.
2002) on the planetary embryos, we decided to take it into account to determine whether (or not)
it drastically aﬀects the outcome of the simulations. For the migration prescription we follow
Cresswell & Nelson (2008), which is partially based on the work of Tanaka et al. (2002). We chose
not to employ the non-isothermal approach of Paardekooper et al. (2011) because generally none
of the terrestrial planets are massive enough to begin outward migration apart from at the very
late stages when the disc surface density is low. Thus, for simplicity, we shall adhere to the isother-
mal case. The speciﬁc decelerations experienced by the planetary embryos due to the disc on the
eccentricity, inclination and semi-major axis are given by

where ~r and ~v are the position and velocity vectors of the embryo, ~k is the unit vector in the

the eccentricity, inclination and semi-major axis. The latter quantities depend in a complicated
manner on the semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, surface density and temperature of the
gas, and mass of the embryo. We refer the interested reader to Cresswell & Nelson (2008) and

for our disc proﬁle and the minimum disc proﬁle of Hayashi (1981) (which has α = 3/2 and β = 1/2).

Walsh et al. (2011) included the ﬁrst two deceleration contributions in equations (1-3) since
these are tidal eﬀects by the disc that damp the eccentricity and inclination, but they omitted the
third (equation 3) which is in part responsible for the inward migration of the planetary embryos.
For the disc that we have chosen we compute near 1 AU tm ∼ 2 (0.1 M⊕/memb)(2000 g cm−2/Σ) Myr,
so any inward migration that the embryos experience will likely be severely restricted because the
migration time scale is longer than the disc lifetime and increases as the disc surface density de-
creases. However te ∼ 21 kyr for a Mars-sized body near 1 AU so the damping eﬀect is a lot stronger
than the migration. For the disc employed by Walsh et al. (2011) the migration and damping time
scales are both at least an order of magnitude longer, so that their eﬀects of type 1 migration are
very weak.

– 8 –

To compare our migration times with earlier results, we note that for an Earth-sized body at
1 AU our nominal disc parameters yield twav ∼ 1700 yr and tm ∼ 180 kyr, which are much longer
than the values of Tanaka et al. (2002) and Tanaka & Ward (2004) because our disc is initially
hotter. The wave time scales as (H/r)4 so that a factor of 1.5 in H/r will result in a factor 5 in
the migration time scale, while tm ∝ (H/r)2 so the eﬀect of the disc temperature is weaker. As
the disc evolves the temperature decreases, speeding up type 1 migration, but so does the surface
density, slowing it down. In general, the eﬀect of type 1 weakens with time.

Thus, the eﬀect of type 1 migration should be relatively weak in our disc model compared
to the traditional results of Tanaka et al. (2002) and Tanaka & Ward (2004). Apart from the
migrating force, the eccentricity and inclination damping forces from the disc will also cause some
inward migration of the embryos due to angular momentum loss, and we expect them to migrate
inwards of the order of 0.1 AU over the lifetime of the disc. In Fig. 2 we plot a contour map of
the normalised torque on the planetary embryos as a function of their distance to the Sun and
their mass at time zero of the age of the disc. The normalised torque is Γn = Γtot/Γ0 where
Γ0 = (memb/M⊙)2(r/H)2(v/r)2Σ. The migration rate is then ˙r = −2rΓtot/L, where L is the
orbital angular momentum (Tanaka et al. 2002). In all the disc models the deﬁnition of the torque
is always inward.

For this project we have run a large sample of numerical simulations of the Grand Tack sce-

nario. These simulations are categorised into four large sets, with further subdivisions therein.

3.

Initial conditions

All simulations start with a high number of small planetesimals, planetary embryos, and the
gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. We do not include Uranus and Neptune in any of the simula-
tions, because they do not have any immediate eﬀects on the formation of the terrestrial planets
(Walsh et al. 2011). In all simulations we chose to not take account of the eﬀect of Saturn’s mass
growth. According to Walsh et al. (2011) and Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014), other eﬀects, such as
the radial evolution of Saturn and the gas giant migration time scale, did not substantially change
the ﬁnal terrestrial planet systems. Given the high number of free parameters, we decided to follow
Walsh et al. (2011) to cases where Jupiter is assumed to have its current mass and is initially placed
on a near-circular orbit at 3.5 AU. A fully-grown Saturn is placed in the 2:3 resonance with Jupiter
at 4.5 AU. During the ﬁrst 0.1 Myr, Jupiter and Saturn migrate from their initial locations (3.5
AU and 4.5 AU) to the tack locations (either 1.5 AU and 2.0 AU for Jupiter), respectively. For
the next 5 Myr, Jupiter and Saturn migrate out to ∼ 5.4 AU and ∼ 7.5 AU, which are appropri-
ate initial conditions for late giant planet migration models (Morbidelli et al. 2007). Walsh et al.
(2011) demonstrated that the migration speed of the gas giants has almost no inﬂuence on the
ﬁnal architecture of the terrestrial system. We therefore used the same linear inward migration
of the gas giants with a time-scale of 0.1 Myr, followed by outward migration via an exponential

– 9 –

prescription with an e-folding time of 0.5 Myr. These time scales are comparable to the typical
rate of Type 2 migration (Lin & Papaloizou 1986).

To compare the eﬀects of diﬀerent formation models on the architecture of the terrestrial

planets, we use various initial distributions of embryos and planetesimals.

3.1. Equal mass embryo initial conditions

For the ﬁrst two large sets of simulations we employ the initial conditions of the embryos and
planetesimals from Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014), but we use our model for the protoplanetary
disc. These simulations were run because we want to directly compare the results of our modiﬁed
simulations – employing a diﬀerent protoplanetary disc, including type 1 migration and a realistic
mass-radius relationship – with theirs. All of the simulations in this set use equal mass embryos
initially situated between 0.7 AU and 3 AU. The embryos were embedded in a disc of planetesi-
mals. The surface density of embryos and planetesimals both scaled with heliocentric distance as
r−3/2. Following Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) the total mass ratio of embryos and planetesimals
in this inner disc is either 1:1, 4:1 or 8:1, with the individual embryo masses being either 0.025,
0.05 or 0.08 M⊕. The equal mass embryo assumption appears to agree with a pebble-accretion
scenario of embryo formation (Morbidelli et al. 2015)(Levison et al., 2015) rather than the more
traditional oligarchic growth scenario (Kokubo & Ida 1998), although which scenario is favoured
is still under considerable debate. To mimic the coagulation evolution of the solids in the disc, we
follow Chambers (2006) and calculate the age of the disc is 0.1 Myr when embryos have a mass of
0.025 M⊕, it is 0.5 Myr when the embryos have a mass of 0.05 M⊕ and 1 Myr when the embryos
have a mass of 0.08 M⊕.

Following Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) again, the total mass in solids in the inner disc
(embryos and planetesimals) is 4.3 M⊕ when the total mass ratio between embryos and plan-
etesimals is 1:1, 5.3 M⊕ when the mass ratio is 4:1 and 6.0 M⊕ when the mass ratio is 8:1.
Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) further argued these diﬀerent initial disc masses were necessary to
keep the post-migration mass in solids between 0.7 AU and 1 AU close to 2 M⊕. Therefore, the
surface density in solids between these diﬀerent initial conditions increases with increasing total
embryo to planetesimal mass ratio. The number of planetary embryos ranged from 29 to 213 de-
pending on their initial mass and total mass ratio. We kept the number of planetesimals at 2000,
regardless of their total mass. The initial densities of the planetesimals and embryos was 3 g cm−3
(Walsh et al. 2011). The permutations of these initial conditions results in nine individual sets of
simulations.

Following Matsumura et al. (2016), for most of the simulations we also added an outer disc
of planetesimals. This disc consists of 500 planetesimals with a total mass of 0.06 M⊕. These
planetesimals are to some degree considered responsible for volatile delivery on the otherwise dry

– 10 –

terrestrial planets Matsumura et al. (2016). The outer planetesimals are distributed between 5 AU
and 9 AU. The eccentricities and inclinations of both embryos and planetesimals are randomly
chosen from a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.01 and 0 to 0.5◦. The other angular orbital
elements were chosen uniformly at random from 0 to 360◦. We ran two sets of these nine permuta-
tions, one with a tack at 1.5 AU as in Walsh et al. (2011), and one with a tack at 2 AU as described
in Matsumura et al. (2016).

3.2. Oligarchic initial conditions

Apart from simulating the formation of the terrestrial planets from a disc of equal-mass embryos
and planetesimals we also run a second set of simulations where the initial conditions are reminiscent
of the traditional oligarchic growth scenario (Kokubo & Ida 1998). To set up our simulations, we
used the semi-analytical oligarchic approach of Chambers (2006). In that work, the mass of embryos
increases up to their isolation mass as

mp(t) = miso tanh3(cid:16) t

τ (cid:17),

(5)

where miso = 2πaΣsb is the isolation mass at semi-major axis a for embryos spaced b AU apart
embedded in a disc with solid surface density Σs. Here τ is the growth time scale which is a complex
function of the semi-major axis, embryo spacing, solid surface density and radii of planetesimals
that accrete onto the embryos. The growth time scale is given by (Chambers 2006)

Here α is the slope of the solid surface density, β is the slope of the temperature, ρgas,0 is the gas
density at 1 AU in the midplane, rc is the radius of planetesimals, ρ is their density and P is the
orbital period (Chambers 2006). Here we used the fact that the gas density proﬁle depends on the
scale height and gas surface density which yields ρg ∝ a−α−3/2+1/2β. Combining all the above gives

where Σs is the solid disc surface density at 1 AU and we assumed that Σs has the same radial
dependence as the gas surface density. This derived value of τ and the subsequent growth of
any embryo near 1 AU agrees well with Figure 1 in Chambers (2006). Adopting α = 3/2 and
β = 6/7, the above equation is a reasonably steep function of semi-major axis at a ﬁxed epoch
because τ ∝ a193/140 ∼ a1.38. When we use the typically-assumed value β = 1/2 then we have
τ ∝ a3/2. At the Earth’s location the growth time for nominal parameters is ∼600 kyr while at
Mars’ current orbit the growth time is ∼1 Myr. This is somewhat shorter than that advocated
by Dauphas & Pourmand (2011) but is within error margins and is easily increased to 1.8 Myr
assuming accretion was caused by planetesimals of ∼50 km.

We constructed our initial disc of embryos and planetesimals as follows. First, we computed
the total mass in solids between 0.7 AU and 3 AU assuming the surface density in solids is Σs =
7 g cm−2(a/1 AU)−3/2. This setup is just the minimum mass solar nebula (Hayashi 1981). Second,
following Ogihara & Ida (2009), we subsequently increased the solid density by a factor of 3 at the
ice line, assumed to be static at 2.7 AU. Third, based on the results of Kokubo & Ida (1998), we
imposed a spacing of 10 mutual Hill radii for the embryos, with the spacing computed assuming
the embryos had their isolation masses. In other words, the semi-major axis of embryo n is an =
an−1[1 + b(2miso/3M⊙)1/3] so that the embryo spacing nearly follows a geometric progression.
Following Chambers (2006) we assumed a planetesimal size of 10 km in computing the growth
time scale of the embryos. Last, we entered the epoch at which Jupiter was assumed to have fully
formed and began migrating. This was either 0.5 Myr, 1 Myr, 2 Myr or 3 Myr. Most embryos have
only reached a fraction of their isolation mass and the remaining mass within their feeding annulus
of 10 Hill radii taken up by planetesimals, with each planetesimal having a mass of 10−3 M⊕.
The eccentricities of the embryos and planetesimals followed a Rayleigh distribution with scale
parameter equal to (mp/3M⊙)1/3. The inclinations also followed a Rayleigh distribution with a
scale parameter equal to half of that of the eccentricities. The other angles were chosen uniformly
at random between 0 and 360◦. All embryos and planetesimals had an initial density of 3 g cm−2.
The most distant embryo was typically at 2.6 AU.

4. Methodology

The gas giants, planetary embryos and planetesimals are simulated with the symplectic SyMBA
integrator (Duncan et al. 1998) with a time step of 0.02 yr for 150 Myr. The end time of the
simulations corresponds closely to the end of the purported Late Veneer (see next section). The
migration of the gas giants was mimicked through ﬁctitious forces described in Walsh et al. (2011).
We ﬁrst employed the same gas proﬁle as Walsh et al. (2011) with two large dips around the
gas giants, which migrated inwards with these planets, but we modiﬁed the gas density proﬁle
during the computation so that it followed the Σ(r) ∝ r−1/2 surface density law of Bitsch et al.
(2015) rather than the Gaussian of Walsh et al. (2011). The initial total mass of the disc was
approximately 0.05 M⊙. The initial disc proﬁle is depicted in Fig. 3. The blue line is the disc

from Bitsch et al. (2015), whereas the red one is from Walsh et al. (2011). Jupiter is assumed to
be at 3.5 AU and the disc age is zero. The planetary embryos experienced tidal damping of their
eccentricities and inclinations and a negative torque from the gas disc as described in Section 2, and
the orbits of the planetesimals evolve due to gas drag using the methods of Brasser et al. (2007).
Following Walsh et al. (2011) and Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) for the purpose of the gas drag,
we assumed each planetesimal had a radius of 50 km. These planetesimals are larger than the
10 km size assumed for oligarchic growth because we wanted to compare our simulations directly
with Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014). The gas drag routines of Brasser et al. (2007) were modiﬁed
slightly to allow for a smooth transition between regimes when the Knudsen number crossed 1. We
now have the following scheme:

• When M > 2.727, CD = 2 for all K and R;
• When R > 1000, CD = 0.44 + 0.2098M2 for M < 2.727;

(11)

Here M, K and R are the Mach, Knudsen and Reynold numbers of the planetesimals, and CD is
the drag coeﬃcient (Brasser et al. 2007). In addition to the drag coeﬃcient routine, we made one
further modiﬁcation to the code.
SyMBA treats collisions between bodies as perfect mergers, preserving their density. This works
well in most circumstances, but given that the mean density of Earth is 5.5 g cm−2 and not 3
g cm−2, we implemented the mass-radius relationship of Seager et al. (2007) to make sure that the
ﬁnal planets have radii comparable to the current terrestrial planets so that their collisional cross
sections are not artiﬁcially large. The relation we employed was

where Rp and Mp are the radius and mass of the planetary embryo. This relation ﬁts Mars, Venus
and Earth well.
During the simulations we computed the mutual gravity between gas giants and embryos, but the
planetesimals were not able to aﬀect each other. This approximation was used to keep the CPU time
within reasonable limits, and is justiﬁed because Jupiter clears the disc beyond 1 AU in 100 kyr.
Planets and planetesimals were removed once they were farther than 100 AU from the Sun (whether
bound or unbound) or when they collided with a planet or ventured closer than 0.2 AU from the Sun.

For each permutation of the equal mass embryo initial conditions of Jacobson & Morbidelli
(2014) we ran 16 simulations (144 for each tack location), while for the oligarchic initial conditions
we ran 16 simulations for each starting epoch (64 for each tack location).
In total, we ran 416
simulations, categorised in Table 1. The oligarchic simulations were run at the Centre for Compu-
tational Astrophysics at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, while the others were
run at the Earth Life Science Institute at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

5. A measure of success

According to its founders, the Grand Tack model has booked several successes. These include,
but are not limited to: the ability to reproduce the mass-orbit distribution of the terrestrial planets
(Walsh et al. 2011) (though mostly only for Venus, Earth and Mars), the compositional gradient
and total mass of the asteroid belt (Walsh et al. 2011), the growth time scale of the terrestrial
planets (Jacobson & Walsh 2015) and in some cases the angular momentum deﬁcit (AMD), spac-
ing and orbital concentration of the terrestrial planets (Jacobson & Morbidelli 2014), and possibly
the timing of the Moon-forming impact (Jacobson et al. 2014). Some of these deserve further dis-
cussion before we outline our criteria for assigning success or failure to the individual simulations

and the model itself.

Jacobson et al. (2014) use simulations of terrestrial planet formation based on the Grand Tack
model to place constraints on the time of the Moon-forming impact (a.k.a. Giant Impact or GI).
They do this by requiring that, after the GI, the Earth subsequently accreted a further 0.5% of
its mass, which they claim is the best estimate compatible with the fraction of highly siderophile
elements in the mantle used to account for the Late Veneer (Walker 2009). From their simulations
they arrive at a timing of 95±32 Myr. This is in agreement with the preferred Moon-forming
time from hafnium-tungsten and samarium-neodymium geochronology, though on the higher end
(Kleine et al. 2005; Touboul et al. 2007). It is also in agreement with recent dynamical modelling
and 40−39Ar age compilations for the HED meteorites that likely originate from asteroid 4 Vesta
(Bottke et al. 2015). In most of the simulations presented by Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014), how-
ever, the last giant impact occurs much earlier than their preferred value. O’Brien et al. (2014)
pointed out that such an early impact violates the constraint posed by the amount of highly
siderophile elements in the Earth’s mantle used to deﬁne the Late Veneer in the ﬁrst place. That
said, a late accretion of 1% is still entirely within reason, and it may have been even higher:
Albar`ede et al. (2013) argue that upwards of 4% of Earth’s mass was added to the planet by the
Late Veneer. Their arguments are based on the timing and amount of water delivery, and the
vaporisation of volatiles during accretion, throughout which a high fraction of impactor material is
lost. Such a substantial amount of post-giant impact accretion would naturally push the epoch of
the Moon-forming impact much further back in time, and leaves the timing issue once again wide
open. A diﬀerent approach or chronometer may be needed.

– 15 –

Marty (2012) argues for an Earth formation time shorter than 50 Myr. In a subsequent study
Avice & Marty (2014) use iodine, plutonium and xenon isotopic data to suggest that the closure
time of the Earth’s atmosphere is 40+20
−10 Myr, which would naturally coincide with the Moon-
forming event. The formation time suggested by Avice & Marty (2014) is in excellent agreement
with the hafnium-tungsten dates of Kleine et al. (2005) (40±10 Myr), but on the lower end of that
advocated by Touboul et al. (2007) (62+92
−30 Myr) and Halliday (2008) (70-100 Myr). In summary,
the timing of the Moon-forming event is still a topic of ongoing debate. It appears that radiogenic
dating results in an earlier GI time than suggested by the simulations of Jacobson et al. (2014),
although the simulation results depend sensitively on the assumed amount of subsequent accretion.
Most of the reported ages agree within error bars, but the range remains tens of millions of years.

Since individual simulations are chaotic and show a great variety in outcomes (Jacobson & Morbidelli

2014), we impose criteria the model must adhere to, which are listed below. In what follows, we
deﬁne the Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars analogues to have masses and semi-major axes within
the ranges (0.025 M⊕ < m < 0.1 M⊕, 0.27 AU < a < 0.5 AU), (0.4 M⊕ < mp < 1.2 M⊕, 0.55 AU <
a < 0.85 AU), (0.5 M⊕ < mp < 1.5 M⊕, 0.85 AU < a < 1.15 AU) and (0.05 M⊕ < mp <
0.15 M⊕, 1.3 AU < a < 1.7 AU). We require that objects in the region of the asteroid belt have
their perihelia q > 1.6 AU and their aphelia Q < 4.5 AU. We want to add a note of caution. Since
we employ initial conditions very similar to Walsh et al. (2011) and Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014)
we expect to have a very low probability of reproducing the mass and semi-major axis of Mercury.
One may then argue we should only base our analysis on the other three terrestrial planets, but we
decided against doing so.

Chambers (2001) introduced several quantities which describe the general dynamical properties

of a planetary system. These are: 1) the AMD, given by

AMD = Pk µk√ak(1 − q1 − e2

k) cos ik

µk√ak

(13)

where µk = mk/M⊙. Second is the fraction of mass in the most massive planet (Sm). Third is a
concentration parameter (Sc), given by

and last, a mean spacing parameter (SH), which is

Sc = max(cid:16)

Unlike Chambers (2001) we use the mutual Hill sphere as the spacing unit. Ultimately we invoke the
following criteria to determine success or failure of the Grand Tack model: statistically the resulting
terrestrial systems must have their median AMD lower than the current value, a concentration

produce at least one Mars analogue (or a probability in excess of 5% for a whole set) and the most
massive planet must have a greater than 5% probability of residing at 1 AU i.e. the cumulative
semi-major axis distribution of the most massive planet must be lower than 0.95 at 1 AU. The
ranges in the listed values of Sc and SH are computed using a Monte Carlo method adopting the
range of masses and semi-major axes of our terrestrial planet analogues stated above.

In this section we present the results of our numerical simulations.

6. Results: Tack at 1.5 AU

6.1. Equal mass embryos

We have run the same simulations as Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) in order to compare our re-
sults directly with theirs, and to determine whether a diﬀerent protoplanetary disc model, realistic
mass-radius relationship and inclusion of type 1 migration will substantially change the properties
of the resulting planets. Generally we ﬁnd that most of our results are in good agreement. We
shall not give a full comparison, but a systematic overview and highlight some similarities and
diﬀerences.

In Fig. 4 we compare the mass of each terrestrial planet that formed in our simulation versus
their semi-major axis. The actual terrestrial planets are depicted as red bullets. For the most part
our results comport with Figure 1 in Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014). In our simulations, however,
the peak of the distribution is situated near Venus’ current location while the region near Earth is
empty in comparison. This is not the case for Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) where the peak is in
between these planets, encompasses both, and is probably caused by early type 1 migration of the
embryos. The mean semi-major axis and mass of the most massive planet in our simulations are
hahi = 0.769 ± 0.109 AU and hmhi = 0.969 ± 0.189 M⊕, with almost no variation within error bars
as a function of either embryo seed mass or total embryo to planetesimal mass ratio. Thus our
Venus analogue is almost always more massive than the Earth analogue, and, with more than 95%
conﬁdence, the position of the most massive planet is inconsistent with a location at 1 AU. This
result is inconsistent with Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) and we attribute this diﬀerence to our use
of a distinctive model for the protoplanetary disc that has a a generally higher surface density,
which causes stronger tidal damping, the inclusion of type 1 migration, and smaller planetary radii.
Indeed, any material that is shepherded inwards by Jupiter will be at high eccentricity, which will
be damped by interaction with the gas disc, which in turn will cause further inward migration
since our gas disc has a higher surface density and a stronger damping than Jacobson & Morbidelli
(2014). We emphasise that the inward migration caused by the damping forces is generally stronger
than the direct eﬀect of the type 1 term, so that even using the non-isothermal prescription of
Paardekooper et al. (2011) would not substantially change the outcome.

In summary, our setup causes a peak density in solids near Venus’ current position rather

than in between Earth and Venus as in Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014). For this reason we ran
another set of simulations with a tack location at 2 AU rather than the typical 1.5 AU to deter-
mine whether that would produce more Earth analogues. We also report a similar low success to
Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) in producing Mercury analogues which, like them, we attribute to
the initial conditions.
How do the resulting planets fare otherwise? In Fig. 5 we plot the spacing parameter SH versus
mass parameter Sm in the top panel and concentration parameter Sc versus normalised AMD (nor-
malised to the current value) in the bottom panel. The typical value of Sc decreases with AMD
because the higher eccentricities force the planets to be wider apart if they are to remain stable. In
this ﬁgure and the ones that follow, red symbols correspond to simulations with an initial embryo
mass of 0.025 M⊕, green to initial embryo mass of 0.05 M⊕ and blue to initial embryo mass of
0.08 M⊕. Bullets are for simulations with a total embryo to planetesimal mass ratio of 1:1, squares
are for a 4:1 mass ratio and triangles for an 8:1 mass ratio. The large black bullet denotes the

and Mars. The beige regions denote 2σ regions around the mean values of SH, Sm and Sc. The
scaled AMD range was chosen not to exceed 1 because it will increase with time (Brasser et al.
2013; Laskar 2008); the lower limit was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Roughly 40% of all simula-
tions fall in either one of the beige regions, though only 10% fall in both regions simultaneously.
The results are summarised in Table 2. We reproduce the trend of Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014)
that the AMD increases with a decrease in total planetesimal mass, though not with initial embryo
mass. Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) favour the cases with high embryo to planetesimal mass ratio,
but the high resulting AMD is inconsistent with the dynamical evolution of the terrestrial planets
(Brasser et al. 2013; Laskar 2008). Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) acknowledge the high AMD is a
potential problem but suggest that fragmentation during embryo-embryo collisions could produce

enough debris to damp the AMD through dynamical friction. It is not clear whether this can be
sustained if collisional grinding is important. Further study is needed to support or deny this claim.

The terrestrial system consists of four planets. We ﬁnd that the average ﬁnal number of planets
decreases with initial embryo mass and is mostly independent of the initial total mass ratio between
the planets and embryos. The relatively high number of planets with low embryo seed mass is most
likely skewed by stranded embryos in the asteroid belt or near Mars’ current position. The concen-
tration parameter Sc increases with more massive embryos but decreases for a lower planetesimal
mass, most likely because the AMD is higher and the planets need to be spaced farther apart to
remain dynamically stable.

We deﬁne the average probability of producing a terrestrial planet analogue as the fraction of
planets in the designated mass-semimajor axis bin divided by the total number of produced planets.
For a Venus analogue this is 24%±7%, for an Earth analogue it is 10%±3% and for a Mars analogue
it is 10% ± 4%. All of these values are above the 5% threshold, but we see an over-abundance of
Venus analogues consistent with the density pileup reported earlier. We produced a total of two
Mercury analogues (out of 635 planets).

Thus far it appears that the only diﬀerence between our results and Jacobson & Morbidelli
(2014) is the peak of the mass distribution being closer to the Sun than theirs, most likely be-
cause of our diﬀerent disc model. Our results diﬀer as well when we investigate the timing of the
Moon-forming impact. Following Jacobson et al. (2014) and Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) again
we compute the total amount of mass accreted by each planet between its last giant impact and the
end of the simulation. We then plot this with a high-order polynomial best ﬁt. The approximate

timing of the Moon-forming impact is the intersection of the ﬁt and some assumed Late Veneer
mass (Jacobson et al. 2014), which is at most a few percent of an Earth mass (Albar`ede et al.
2013). The lower the amount of assumed late accreted mass, the later the giant impact had to
occur because less mass had to have been around to impact the Earth afterwards.

We plot our results in Fig. 6, and obtain a best-ﬁt value of 64 Myr for the timing of the
Moon-forming event assuming 1% subsequent accretion. This is in good agreement with the Hf-W
results from Kleine et al. (2005) and Touboul et al. (2007) but also sooner than what was sug-
gested in the simulations of Jacobson et al. (2014). The diﬀerence in timing is most likely caused
by us considering an accreted Late Veneer mass of 1% rather than 0.5%. However, the range of
mass accreted after the giant impact is rather large. From the ﬁgure it is clear that this impact
could have occurred anywhere between 30 Myr and 120 Myr, given the range of late accretion
mass and uncertainties in the ﬁt. Therefore we do not think that our simulations, or others such
as Jacobson et al. (2014) for that matter, can conﬁdently predict the timing of the Moon-forming

event with this method.

Another issue that requires attention is the growth of Mars. Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) con-

clude that it is very diﬃcult to reproduce the rapid growth of Mars as advocated by Dauphas & Pourmand
(2011). Figure 7 shows the evolution of the mass of several Mars analogues produced in our simu-
lations as a function of time. The beige region should be avoided because the growth rate in this
region is inconsistent with the Hf-W chronometer of Mars’ formation (Nimmo & Kleine 2007). The
blue dashed curve shows a stretched exponential growth function m ∝ mMars(1 − exp[−(t/τ )β]).
We ﬁt a seed mass of 0.04 M⊕, stretching parameter β ∼ 0.5 and e-folding time τ ∼ 10 Myr.
These values are nearly identical to the growth of Earth and Venus (Jacobson & Walsh 2015).
Some Mars analogues experience early giant impacts with other embryos, substantially increas-
ing their mass, but even then the ﬁnal growth is slow and is inconsistent with the rapid growth
advocated by Dauphas & Pourmand (2011), though still within limits of the Hf-W chronology of

Nimmo & Kleine (2007).

One last thing that has not been actively reported by either Walsh et al. (2011), Jacobson & Morbidelli

(2014) or O’Brien et al. (2014) is the amount of remaining mass in planetesimals. At the end of
our simulations, we typically have a remnant mass in planetesimals of 0.051 M⊕±0.027 M⊕, which
is comparable to the total mass required to reproduce the Late Veneer (Raymond et al. 2013). The
remnant mass depends on the original total mass ratio between planetary embryos and planetes-
imals. The simulations with an initial 1:1 ratio have a typical ﬁnal mass of 0.08 M⊕ while the
8:1 simulations typically have 0.01 M⊕. The decay follows a stretched exponential with best ﬁts
β = 0.43 ± 0.03 and β log τ = 0.40 ± 0.04, comparable to the results of Jacobson & Walsh (2015).
Thus, after 150 Myr of evolution the terrestrial planets would subsequently accrete an amount
comparable to the Late Veneer. This could be problematic if the total accreted mass on the Earth
after lunar formation is of the order of 1% because the subsequent accretion would overshoot the
accepted 1% value, but only by a small amount.

6.2. Oligarchic embryos

In this subsection we report the results of Grand Tack simulations with the oligarchic initial
conditions. Since we do not expect substantial diﬀerences between this model and the equal mass
embryo one of Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014), we shall only report on the overall results.
Figures 8 and 9 are the oligarchic equivalents of Figs. 4 and 5. It appears that the correspondence
with the real terrestrial system worsens as the time of the onset of migration increases. In the sec-
ond ﬁgure the red dots are for the simulations where the disc age (time of the onset of migration)
is 0.5 Myr. Orange dots are for a disc age of 1 Myr, green for 2 Myr and blue for 3 Myr. There
are a few visible trends. First, the ﬁnal AMD value tends to increase with increasing disc age.
This is unsurprising because the total mass in planetesimals decreases as the disc ages, so there
is less mass to exert dynamical friction on the forming planets. Half of all systems are within the
AMD-Sc boundaries in the bottom panel, but only 11% in the SH − Sm plot at the top, implying
only 5% fall into both regions simultaneously, lower than in the equal mass embryo case. The equal
mass simulations have nearly uniform spacing anywhere from 20 to over 50 Hill radii. Systems with
older disc ages are more widely spaced, while systems with younger disc ages – and therefore lower
embryo seed masses and more mass in planetesimals – tend to be compact, with a typical spacing

of 20 Hill radii, reminiscent of extrasolar systems (Fang & Margot 2013). The older systems also
tend to have fewer planets, and these planets all appear to be of similar, sub-Venus masses because
we observe a trend of a decreasing number of planets with older disc ages. The mean number of
planets as a function of disc age are listed in Table 3.

Visually the results from the oligarchic model appear to be diﬀerent from the equal mass em-
bryo setup, but statistically the models are nearly identical (see Table 3). We report no Mercury
analogues, a probability of 32%±3% for Venus analogues, 10%±5% for Earth analogues and 9%±5%
for Mars analogues. The location and mass of the most massive planet is hahi = 0.782 AU±0.089 AU
and hmhi = 0.805M⊕ ± 0.160M⊕, on the low side for both quantities. Once again the semi-major
axis of the most massive planet is statistically inconsistent with the Earth’s. In addition, unlike
the equal mass embryo case, we did not change the disc mass from one set of of simulations to the
next, which could account for the lower mass of the most massive planet.

We point out that we only tested the oligarchic initial conditions for disc mass with a a surface
density of Σ0 = 7 g cm−2 at 1 AU. It is possible that a higher initial surface density would lead
to higher planetary masses at the end of the simulations. That said, it is unclear whether a
higher surface density would increase the typical spacing between the planets, because of the weak
dependence of the Hill radius on the mass.
When investigating the timing of the Moon-forming impact, we arrive at a time of 100 Myr, but
once again the range is large, from 20 Myr to 120 Myr. The nominal value is a little later than
favoured by the geochronology (Kleine et al. 2005; Touboul et al. 2007) or the plutogenic-xenon
arguments of Avice & Marty (2014). In any case, the mass left in planetesimals after 150 Myr of
simulation is 0.045 M⊕ ± 0.029 M⊕, comparable to the equal mass embryo case. Both the timing
of the Moon-forming impact and remnant mass are statistically the same as for the equal mass
embryo case. Lastly, the growth of Mars proceeds similarly to that depicted in Fig. 7. In summary,

both the oligarchic model and the equal mass embryo model are statistically identical within error
margins, and we cannot favour one over the other. Further study is needed to distinguish the two.

7. Results: Tack at 2 AU

The simulations with a tack at 2 AU were performed to determine whether a more distant tack
location would result in the Earth analogue being generally more massive than the Venus analogue
and whether it improves the overall ﬁt of the model with the current architecture of the terrestrial
planets. Since much of the underlying dynamics are the same, we shall only report the highlights.

7.1. Equal mass embryos

Figure 10 is a scatter plot of the ﬁnal semi-major axis and masses of the planets produced in
our simulations. The wider, more massive disc will naturally produce more massive planets over
a wider range of heliocentric distances, and the plot should be compared with Fig. 4. There are
two visual diﬀerences between the two sets of outcomes. First, the peak of the distribution is now
farther out than with a tack at 1.5 AU. Indeed, the mean semi-major axis of the most massive
planet is at hahi = 0.91 AU ± 0.19 AU, much closer to the current position of Earth than with a
tack at 1.5 AU. The most massive planet now has a mean mass of hmhi = 1.15M⊕ ± 0.26M⊕,
which is more massive than Earth but well within error margins. This increased mass is most likely
caused by the accretion annulus being wider, having been truncated at 1.25 AU rather than at

1 AU. The outward tail is also caused by the same eﬀect. We explore whether this also implies
that a tack at 2 AU produces a better overall outcome.

First, we report that the average probability of producing a Venus analogue is 17% ± 4%, an
Earth analogue of 13% ± 5% and a Mars analogue of 5% ± 3%. We also produce some Mercury
analogues (0.55%± 0.83%). Overall, the production of Venus and Earth analogues is similar, while
the production of Venus analogues was more than twice as high as Earth analogues when the tack
occurred at 1.5 AU. The production of Mars analogues is low, at the threshold of acceptability,
caused by the fact that we generally create more massive planets near Mars’ current position than
with a tack at 1.5 AU.

In comparison to the equal mass embryo simulations with a tack at 1.5 AU the planetary
systems generated here have more planets on average. This is especially true for the cases with
embryos of 0.025 M⊕ and a high mass in planetesimals. We list the number of planets and the
standard deviation in Table 4. In Fig. 11 we once again plot the spacing parameter SH vs mass
parameter Sm in the top panel and concentration parameter Sc vs normalised AMD in the bottom
panel. A similar trend of decreasing Sc with increasing AMD is visible, but not as pronounced.
What is clear is that all of the systems have a concentration lower than or equal to that of the
current terrestrial planets; none of them are higher (bottom panel). Since most systems have a
spacing that is more compact than the current terrestrial planets (top panel), the lower concen-
tration implies a lower variation in mass between the planets, which is generally what is observed
in Fig. 10. Things take a turn for the worse when we try to match the ranges of Sc, Sm, SH and
the AMD simultaneously. We ﬁnd that only 3/144 cases do so, which is much lower than the 5%
threshold we have adopted, and much lower than the 10% reported earlier when the tack was at
1.5 AU. This low probability argues against a tack location at 2 AU being suitable to reproduce the
current architecture of the terrestrial planets with the equal mass embryo initial conditions, despite
the visual accuracy of ﬁt. We generally ﬁnd that Sc is low while SH and the AMD are comparable

– 28 –

to the case with a tack at 1.5 AU, suggesting that the mass distribution is narrower and the mass
variations between planets are less extreme. Most of the concentration values are low but within
the acceptable range.

The last two issues are the timing of the Moon-forming impact, which is at 60 Myr but with
the same range (30 Myr to 120 Myr) as reported earlier, and a leftover planetesimal mass of
0.053M⊕ ± 0.04M⊕, once again on the high end but in agreement with simulations having a tack
at 1.5 AU. The simulations with an initial 1:1 ratio have a typical ﬁnal mass of 0.1 M⊕ while the
8:1 simulations typically have 0.02 M⊕. The decay follows a stretched exponential with best ﬁts
β = 0.44± 0.03 and β log τ = 0.52± 0.05, which results in a slower decay than with a tack at 1.5 AU
and explains the higher leftover mass.

7.2. Oligarchic embryos

In the previous subsection we investigated whether or not a tack location at 2 AU would yield
a better outcome for the overall architecture of the terrestrial planets than a tack at 1.5 AU in
the case of equal mass embryo initial conditions. We concluded that it appears to be diﬃcult for
this combination of tack location and initial conditions to simultaneously reproduce the combined
spacing, concentration, mass distribution and AMD of the terrestrial planets, despite generating
more Earth analogues and the heaviest planet being closer to Earth’s current location. It is now
worth investigating whether the oligarchic system fares any better.

Figures 12 and 13 depict the relation between mass and semi-major axis, and spacing, concen-
tration, mass and AMD distributions as usual. Once again we see a broader semi-major axis-mass
distribution and an overall closer spacing and lower concentration. The concentration is, however,
generally a little higher than in the equal mass embryo case.
Indeed, we ﬁnd that 10% of the
outcomes fall within both beige regions simultaneously, higher than for the equal mass embryo
case and comparable to the simulations with a tack at 1.5 AU. The production of terrestrial planet
analogues is similar to the equal mass embryo case above so that we tend to produce more planets
on average than with a tack at 1.5 AU, but somewhat fewer than the equal mass embryo case with
a tack at 2 AU. The ﬁnal results are listed in Table 5.

Similarly to the equal mass embryo case with a tack at 2 AU we produce Venus analogues
20% ± 3% of the time, Earth analogues 13% ± 3% of the time and Mars analogues with a probabil-
ity of 6%±3%. The wider mass annulus also results in the heaviest planet having a mean semi-major
axis of hahi = 0.96 AU±0.18 AU, but its mean mass remains a little low at hmhi = 0.88M⊕±0.18M⊕,
probably because we did not enhance the disc mass per set of simulations as we did for the equal
mass embryo case. Once again the concentration value is low and we see SH ∼ 25 Hill radii for
early disc ages and an increase in the AMD with disc age.

the panels indicates the time at which Jupiter and Saturn had formed and migrated into the inner
solar system. Beige regions indicate the range of our terrestrial planet analogues. Oligarchic initial

The Moon-forming impact occurs at 90 Myr, ranging from 30 Myr to 120 Myr depending on
the amount of late accretion. The mass in leftover planetesimals is comparable to earlier simulations
at 0.054M⊕ ± 0.038M⊕.

7.3. Summary

The summary of our results is displayed in Table 6. The criteria we consider important are
whether the model can produce Mars with a probability higher than 5%, whether the architecture
of the system in terms of spacing, concentration, mass and AMD is consistent with the current
planets, and whether the mass and semi-major axis of the heaviest planet are consistent with those
of Earth. The Moon-forming impact is a less stringent criterion because of the inherent uncertainty
in the late-accreted mass and the wide range of ages that appear as a result. All that matters is
that it is within the error bars of the reported hafnium-tungsten ages, which it is, but it does not

provide any further constraints on the model.

It appears that most initial conditions work to some extent. A tack at 2 AU is able to place
the most massive planet near Earth’s current location and thus being the only model to satisfy the
semi-major axis constraint of the heaviest planet. This statistically rules out a tack at 1.5 AU with
the constraints that we impose and the disc parameters and migration prescription that we used.
However, the equal mass embryo case with a tack at 2 AU is problematic because of its low ability
to reproduce the spacing, concentration, mass and AMD ranges simultaneously. We are conﬁdent
this low probability is inherent in the model and not caused by sampling and therefore we also
rule it out. This leaves us with the oligarchic model with a tack at 2 AU. The remnant mass in
planetesimals is an obvious concern, but the somewhat low mass of the most massive planet when
the tack occurred at 2 AU cannot be statistically rejected. The disc age in the oligarchic model
that best matches all constraints is 2 Myr, which is a typical time range to form the gas giants.

We point out that the above conclusions, drawn from Table 6 are valid for the disc model that we
have employed. We return to its implications in the next section. One thing we have not mentioned
thus far is the total mass of material we emplace in the asteroid belt. This matter is discussed in
detail in the next section.

8. Discussion

In this study we ran a high number of terrestrial planet simulations in the framework of the
Grand Tack model with a range of initial conditions and two diﬀerent tack locations. In the previ-
ous subsection we concluded that, despite using a diﬀerent model for the protoplanetary disc, the
inclusion of type 1 migration and a realistic mass-radius relationship, the outcomes of our simula-
tions are broadly similar, though each setup has its own unique pros and cons.

We have decided to use a diﬀerent disc model than the traditional setup of Walsh et al. (2011)
and we have outlined our reasons for doing so. We ﬁnd that a tack at 1.5 AU leaves too much
mass near Venus’ location. We attribute this to a combination of type 1 migration and inward
shepherding by Jupiter, which decreases the semi-major axis of material down to below 1 AU but
increases the eccentricity, so that further inward migration will ensue. This raises the question as
to how sensitive our results are to the choice of disc model. This can only be answered by running
more simulations with varying disc parameters, which is beyond the scope of the current study.
We have used a relatively hot and puﬀy disc, with a scale height that is higher than traditional
values (Hayashi 1981; Tanaka et al. 2002; Tanaka & Ward 2004) caused by viscous heating in the

inner disc. This higher scale height causes slower embryo migration. Thus, making use of a colder,
thinner disc would likely have exacerbated the overproduction of Venus analogues with a tack at
1.5 AU. One way to mitigate this problem is to use a much lower surface density, as was done
by Walsh et al. (2011) and Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014) but their values seem artiﬁcial. A much
lower surface density would decrease the migration rate of Jupiter and Saturn, and even though
their migration rate does not appear to aﬀect the ﬁnal orbital architecture of the terrestrial system
(Walsh et al. 2011), it does increase the diﬃculty for these planets to reach their ﬁnal positions
beyond 5 AU (D’Angelo & Marzari 2012). Thus, even when using a colder, less massive disc, we
still expect to see an overproduction of Venus analogues when the tack occurred near 1.5 AU.

A second topic concerns the timing of the Moon-forming impact. We generally ﬁnd agree-
ment between our typical time of 60-90 Myr and geochronology. However, our uncertainties are
typically 30 Myr or longer, suggesting the GI occurred anywhere from 30 Myr to 120 Myr, which
is what we have claimed in the previous sections. It is debatable whether this range implies any-
thing meaningful. It is consistent with the value 95±32 Myr reported in Jacobson et al. (2014),
even though they ran their simulations for a little longer and used a much lower amount of late ac-
creted mass. In summary, we do not think that our simulations, nor those of Jacobson et al. (2014),
can say anything meaningful about the timing of the GI beyond what is known from geochronology.

Another issue that requires discussion is the mass left over in planetesimals after planet forma-
tion. This is typically 0.05 M⊕ but can be as high as 0.1 M⊕. This leftover mass has implications
for the cratering rates on Noachian Mars and the Pre-Nectarian Moon. The most eﬃcient way to
eliminate this material is through collision with the terrestrial planets. Ejection by the giant plan-
ets or collisions with the Sun is much more diﬃcult. Preliminary simulations of this population of
planetesimals indicate it decays slowly, following a stretched exponential with stretching parameter
β ∼ 0.83 and e-folding time τ ∼ 85 Myr. A slow decay is preferred by lunar cratering records
(Werner et al. 2014), but a slower decay is necessary so as not to have late melting of the crust of
the planets (Abramov et al. 2013); Abramov & Mojzsis (2016).

One solution may be for these planetesimals to grind themselves to dust and subsequently be
lost through Poynting-Robertson drag or radiation pressure. The diﬃculty with this idea is that
the high ratio of highly siderophile elements in the Earth and Moon suggest that the Late Veneer
impactors were large (around 2000 km) (Bottke et al. 2010). If these impactors were large there
is no reason to believe the impactors after the Late Veneer were substantially smaller. A simple
argument is that Ceres is the only 1000 km body in the asteroid belt, and with a typical implan-
tation probability of 0.1% (Walsh et al. 2011), there should have been at least 1000 Ceres-sized
bodies. With of the order of 5% of the total mass remaining after 150 Myr we have 50 Ceres-sized
bodies still present, with perhaps ten bodies the size of 4000 km. Since it was probable that the
size distribution of the remnant planetesimals was shallow (Bottke et al. 2010), most of the mass
is in the large bodies, and thus we consider it very unlikely that this mass was ground down by

collisional erosion.

– 33 –

A quick estimate of the collisional time scale can be made with an nσvt = 1 argument, where
n is the number density of planetesimals, v is their typical encounter velocity, and σ = πr2 is their
collisional cross section. The number density n = M/(2π2a2m∆a sin i), where M is the total mass
of remnant planetesimals, ∆a is the width of the annulus in which the planetesimals are situated
and m is their individual mass. We then have

3M vt

8π2a2∆a sin iρr

= 1.

(16)

From our simulations we ﬁnd that the typical semi-major axis of these planetesimals is 1.5 AU
and ∆a ∼ 0.5 AU, i ∼ 20◦ and using a planetesimal density of ρ = 3000 kg m−3 and encounter
velocity v ∼ evK ∼ 12 km s−1 we have for a planetesimal of radius 500 km that t > 1 Gyr. This
is longer than the estimate of 56 Myr of Raymond et al. (2013) because they consider a smaller
annulus and a planar problem. Thus for large planetesimals, collisional grinding is most likely
unimportant, though future studies need to verify or deny this claim. In any case, the amount of
leftover material warrants a separate investigation, in particular if the size distribution is shallow
and most mass is in large planetesimals. Its results will be discussed in a companion paper.

Another topic that was not discussed in the previous sections was the amount of mass that is
placed in the asteroid belt. With our deﬁnition of the asteroid belt region (perihelion q > 1.6 AU
and aphelion Q < 4.5 AU), we ﬁnd that simulations with a tack at 1.5 AU place roughly 0.6% of
material in the asteroid belt, while this increases to 0.9% when the tack is at 2 AU, comparable
to but slightly in excess of the percentage reported by Walsh et al. (2011). The main reason our
simulations with a tack at 1.5 AU have a higher amount of mass in the asteroid belt than theirs is
due to the stronger gas drag acting on planetesimals in the beginning of the simulations because
the surface density of our disc is higher than theirs. The higher value with the tack at 2 AU is
clearly a result of weaker sculpting of the disc by Jupiter. All of these simulations leave us with
an asteroid belt whose mass is at least an order of magnitude higher than the current value, with
the caveat that we only used planetesimals with a size of 50 km for the purpose of the gas drag.
Larger planetesimals would have reduced the remnant mass in the asteroid belt while a smaller size
would have increased it (Matsumura et al. 2016). It has been suggested that chaotic diﬀusion over
4 Gyr and giant planet evolution deplete the belt by approximately 75% of its mass, but then the
remaining amount of mass is still inconsistent with what is observed today (Minton & Malhotra
2010). Then again, our simulations do not take collisional erosion into account, which could erode
the belt even further (Bottke et al. 2005).

A ﬁnal topic that requires discussion is the total number of planets. When taking each set of
initial conditions as a whole, the total number of planets is 4.4 ± 1.3 for the equal mass embryo
case with a tack at 1.5 AU, 3.3 ± 0.8 for the oligarchic case with a tack at 1.5 AU, 4.8 ± 1.3
for the equal mass embryo case with a tack at 2 AU and 4.3 ± 0.9 for the oligarchic case with a

– 34 –

tack at 2 AU. All of these are consistent with four terrestrial planets at the end. Yet, most of our
simulations do not produce a Mercury analogue. This is a result of the initial conditions that we
have employed, and it is noteworthy that the formation of Mercury has been mostly ignored in
earlier works (Walsh et al. 2011; O’Brien et al. 2014; Jacobson et al. 2014; Jacobson & Morbidelli
2014; Jacobson & Walsh 2015). If we are to ignore it too, then the total number of planets we must
produce is three. All models as a whole are statistically consistent with three terrestrial planets,
though some subsets within the four models are not. Since the formation and evolution of Mercury
are currently unknown, further study is needed to rule out whether the oligarchic model with a
tack at 2 AU can be made consistent with the current inner solar system. It is possible that by
the end of our simulations the ﬁnal system is not stable in the long-term and a very late collision
could remove another planet. This is inconsistent with the historical evolution of the Solar System
so we have to take the number of planets at the end of the simulations as ﬁnal.

9. Conclusions

We have investigated the dynamical formation of the terrestrial planets in the framework of
the Grand Tack scenario. It has been claimed that the Grand Tack reproduces several observed
features of the inner Solar System that previous models failed to do, such as the low mass of Mars
and the compositional gradient in the asteroid belt. We examined this scenario in more detail here
but applied a diﬀerent disc proﬁle, a realistic mass-radius relationship, and took into account type
1 migration. We have stated our reasons for doing so in Section 2, and performed sensitivity tests
to determine whether any of these diﬀerences matter. The answer appears to be ’yes’: with the
initial conditions and disc and migration model that we employed we statistically ruled out a tack
at 1.5 AU because we produced an excess of Venus analogues and a deﬁcit of Earth analogues. We
attribute this excess of Venus analogues to our disc model because it has a higher surface density
than the one of Walsh et al. (2011). Additionally, with more than 95% conﬁdence, the semi-major
axis of the most massive planet is inconsistent with Earth’s location, while upon a visual inspection
of their results the same is not true in the simulations of Jacobson & Morbidelli (2014). Thus the
inclusion of type 1 migration, and a much higher initial disc surface density, together with smaller
radii of the planets, serve to shift the mass distribution closer to the Sun. This calls for a more
distant tack location. We ﬁnd that the model that best matches the current architecture of the
terrestrial planets has a tack at 2 AU and oligarchic initial conditions.
