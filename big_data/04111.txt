Liouville Numbers

Abstract

In this paper, in particular, we prove the existence of uncountable many
transcendental entire functions taking the set of the Liouville numbers into
itself. This solves a problem posed by K. Mahler in 1984.

1. Introduction

A transcendental function is a function f (x) such that the only complex
polynomial satisfying P (x, f (x)) = 0, for all x in its domain, is the null poly-
nomial. For instance, the trigonometric functions, the exponential function,
and their inverses.

The study of the arithmetic behavior of transcendental functions at com-
plex points has attracted the attention of many mathematicians for decades.
The ﬁrst result concerning this subject goes back to 1884, when Lindemann
proved that the transcendental function ez assumes transcendental values at
all nonzero algebraic point. In 1886, Weierstrass gave an example of a tran-
scendental entire function which takes rational values at all rational points.
Later, St¨ackel [10] proved that for each countable subset Σ ⊆ C and each
dense subset T ⊆ C, there is a transcendental entire function f such that
f (Σ) ⊆ T (F. Gramain showed that St¨ackel’s theorem is valid if Σ and T are

subsets of R). Another construction due to St¨ackel [11] produces a transcen-
dental entire function f whose derivatives f (t), for t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., all map Q
into Q. Two years later, G. Faber reﬁned this result by showing the existence
of a transcendental entire function such that f (t)(Q) ⊆ Q(i), for all t ≥ 0. In
1968, van der Poorten [9] proved the existence of a transcendental function
f , such that f (s)(α) ∈ Q(α), for all α ∈ Q.

Note that all the previously mentioned results deal with the arithmetic

behavior of a countable set by a transcendental function.

A real number ξ is called a Liouville number, if there exist inﬁnitely many

rational numbers (pn/qn)n≥1, with qn > 1 and such that

It is well-known that the set of the Liouville numbers L is a Gδ-dense set

and therefore an uncountable set.

In his pioneering book, Maillet [5, Chapitre III] discusses some arithmetic
properties of Liouville numbers. One of them is that, given a non-constant
rational function f , with rational coeﬃcients, if ξ is a Liouville number, then
so is f (ξ). Motivated by this fact, in 1984, in one of his last papers, K.
Mahler [4] raised the following question (this question also appeared in the
Bugeaud’s book [3, p. 215]):

Mahler’s question. Are there transcendental entire functions f (z) such
that if ξ is any Liouville number, then so is f (ξ)?

He also said that: “The diﬃculty of this problem lies of course in the fact
that the set of all Liouville numbers is non-enumerable”. Bernik and Dom-
brovski˘i [2] and Alnia¸cik [1] obtained some results related to this question.
Also, recently, some authors (see [6, 7, 8]) constructed classes of Liouville
numbers which are mapped into Liouville numbers by transcendental entire
functions.

In this paper, we solve completely this Mahler’s question by proving the

following result:

Theorem 1. Let (sn)n≥1 be sequence of positive integers satisfying that, for
any given k ≥ 1, the quotient sn/sk
n−1 tends to inﬁnity as n → ∞. Let

F : C → C be a function deﬁned by

F (z) =Xk≥1

αk
10k! zk,

where αk = 1 if k = sj and αk = 0 otherwise. Then F is a transcendental
entire function such that F (L) ⊆ L. In particular, there exist uncountable
many transcendental entire functions taking the set of the Liouville numbers
into itself.

Let us describe in a few words the main ideas for proving Theorem 1.

First, our desired function has the form F (z) = Pn≥1 ztn/10tn!, where (tn)n

is an integer sequence with a very fast growth. We then approximate F (ξ),
where ξ is a Liouville number, by a convenient truncation Fm(pn/qn) for
suﬃciently large m and n. After that, we take the advantage of the fact
that our series has much more zero coeﬃcients than a strongly lacunary
series. This, together with the fact that well-approximations come from the
continued fraction allows us to arrive at our desired estimate. The proof splits
in two cases depending on the growth of the denominator of the approximants
of ξ.

2. The proof of Theorem 1

Let (sn)n≥1 and F (z) deﬁned as in the statement of Theorem 1. Clearly,
F is a transcendental entire function and now, we shall prove that F (L) ⊆ L.
Let ξ be a Liouville number and let (pn/qn)n≥1 be rational numbers such
that gcd(pn, qn) = 1 and |ξ − pn/qn| < 1/qn
n, for all n ≥ 1. Set φn = φn(ξ)
as the smallest positive integer k such that qn ≤ 10k!. We have two cases to
consider:

Case 1. When φn ≤ nk for some k ≥ 1 and all n ≥ 1.

In this case, qn ≤ 10φn! ≤ 10nk!. Now, consider the truncations

and the convergents

Note that den(γn) = 10n!(q2n2)n. We shall prove that F (ξ) is well-approximated
for the rational numbers γn in a convenient way which ensures that it is a
Liouville number. Since |F (ξ) − γn| 6 |F (ξ) − Fn(ξ)| + |Fn(ξ) − γn|, we need
estimate each part in the right-hand side. For that, we have

Fn(ξ) − γn =

fraction of ξ), a straightforward calculation gives

|Fn(ξ) − γn| <

for all suﬃciently large n.

Now, for estimating |F (ξ) − Fn(ξ)|, we shall consider the truncation in

|F (ξ) − Fsj−1(ξ)| ≤

(den(γn))n ,

for all suﬃciently large n. Thus, in order to prove that F (ξ) is a Liouville
number, it suﬃces to prove that |F (ξ) − γn| > 0 for inﬁnitely many integers

n. Suppose the contrary, then γn = p/q for all suﬃciently large integers n.
By multiplying this equality by 10n!qn
2n2q, we get that q2n2 divides q for in-
ﬁnitely many integers n which is an absurd. Thus F (ξ) is a Liouville number
as desired.

Case 2. When φn is not bounded for nk for all k ≥ 1.

In this case, we have the existence of inﬁnitely many pairs (nj, kj) ∈ Z2

such that

φnj ≤ nkj

j and φnj+1 > (nj + 1)kj .

Now, deﬁne tj as the smallest integer such that stj > φnj and deﬁne our

approximants as

Note that den(γj) = 10stj −1!q

As before, we want to obtain an estimate for |F (ξ) − γj| ≤ |Fstj −1(ξ) −
γj| + |F (ξ) − Fstj −1(ξ)|. First, we shall estimate |F (ξ) − Fstj −1(ξ)|. For that,
note that for all suﬃciently large j, we have 10stj −1 > |ξ| and then

|F (ξ) − Fstj −1(ξ)| = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

since max{|ξ|, |pnj/qnj |} < 1 + |ξ| ≤ 10stj −1. Then

Now, we use the well-known fact that

Also, by deﬁnition, since φnj+1 > (nj + 1)kj , then qnj qnj +1 ≥ qnj+1 >
10(nj+1)k!. Therefore, for all kj ≥ 5, we have

Therefore

since stj −1 ≤ φnj ≤ nkj

|Fstj −1(ξ) − γj| <

den(γj)stj −1 .

(5)

By combining (3) and (5) we obtain

|F (ξ) − γj| <

2

den(γj)stj −1 ,

for all suﬃciently large j. Since |F (ξ) − γj| > 0 for all suﬃciently large j (by
a same argument as before), then F (ξ) is a Liouville number as desired. In
conclusion, F (L) ⊆ L.

The proof of the existence of the uncountable many functions F (z) with
this property is because there is a binary tree of diﬀerent possibilities for
(sn)n≥1 (and each choice deﬁne a diﬀerent function F (z)). For example, take
sn = an!
(cid:3)

n , where an ∈ {2, 3}.
