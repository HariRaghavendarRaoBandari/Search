DONALDSON-THOMAS TRANSFORMATION OF GRASSMANNIAN

DAPING WENG

Abstract. Kontsevich and Soibelman [KS08] deﬁned the notion of Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3d
Calabi-Yau category with a stability condition. A family of examples of such categories can be constructed
from an arbitrary cluster variety. The corresponding Donaldson-Thomas invariants are encoded by a special
formal automorphism of the cluster variety, known as Donaldson-Thomas transformation.
Fix two integers m and n with 1 < m < m+1 < n. It is known that the conﬁguration space Conf n(Pm−1),
In this paper we determine the
closely related to Grassmannian Grm(n), is a cluster Poisson variety.
Donaldson-Thomas transformation of Conf n(Pm−1) as an explicitly deﬁned birational automorphism of
Conf n(Pm−1). Its variant acts on the Grassmannian by a birational automorphism.

1. Introduction

Donaldson-Thomas invariants were ﬁrst introduced by Donaldson and Thomas [DT98] as geometric in-
variants on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Kontsevich and Soibelman [KS08] generalized the notion of Donaldson-
Thomas invariants to 3d Calabi-Yau categories with a stability condition. Cluster varieties produce an
important family of such 3d Calabi-Yau categories, and the data of Donaldson-Thomas invariants in this
setting is encoded by a special formal automorphism of the cluster variety, called the Donaldson-Thomas
transformation. Keller [Kel13] gave a combinatorial characterization of a subclass of Donaldson-Thomas
transformations using quiver mutations. Goncharov and Shen [GS16] gave an equivalent deﬁnition using
tropical points of the cluster varieties; Donaldson-Thomas transformations of this particular form are called
cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformations. The main result of our paper claims that the Donaldson-Thomas

transformation of the cluster Poisson variety Conf n(Pm−1) is a cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation,
which we deﬁne explicitly as a birational automorphism on the space Conf n(Pm−1).

1.1. Main Result. Fix two integers m and n with 1 < m < m + 1 < n. The conﬁguration space of n points
on Pm−1 is deﬁned as

Conf n(Pm−1) := PGLm\(cid:0)Pm−1(cid:1)n

,

where PGLm acts diagonally on the product of projective spaces. Since we have quotient out the projective
linear group action, conﬁguration spaces of points in isomorphic projective spaces are canonically isomor-
phic. This observation is important for our deﬁnition of the transformation DT of Conf n(Pm−1) below.
Let [l1, . . . , ln] be a generic point in Conf n(Pm−1). Any consecutive m − 1 lines li, . . . , li+m−2 span a
hyperplane in Cm and uniquely deﬁne a dual line in (Cm)∨; we will denote this dual line by h[i,i+m−2]. Since
Conf n(Pm−1) and Conf n((Pm−1)∨) are canonically isomorphic, we can use it to deﬁne a rational map

DT : Conf n(Pm−1) → Conf n(Pm−1)

[l1, . . . , ln] (cid:55)→(cid:2)h[2−m,n], h[3−m,1], . . . , h[1−m,n−1]

(cid:3) .

Our main result of this paper is the following.
Theorem 1.1. The rational map DT is the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation of Conf n(Pm−1).

1.2. Applications. There are several applications of our main result, suggested by Goncharov.

The ﬁrst application is a short proof of Keller’s reformulated version of Zamolodchikov’s periodicity
The original form of the periodicity conjecture states that for a pair of Dynkin diagrams ∆ and ∆(cid:48) with

conjecture [Kel12].

Yi,i(cid:48),t−1Yi,i(cid:48),t+1 =

is of period dividing 2(h + h(cid:48)) in t, where h and h(cid:48) are the Coxeter numbers of ∆ and ∆(cid:48).

The periodicity conjecture has been proved by many people using various methods (c.f. [Kel12]): Frenkel
and Szenes [FS95], and idependently by Giozzi and Tateo [GT96] for the type (An, A1); Fomin and Zelevinsky
for the type (∆, A1); independently by Volkov [Vol07], Szenes [Sze09], and Henriques [Hen07] for the type
(An, Am). In [Kel12], Keller reformulated the periodicity conjecture and provided a proof for the general
case (∆, ∆(cid:48)) using categoriﬁcation of cluster algebras and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. Keller’s work links
the the periodicity conjecture to cluster theories, and reduces the periodicity conjecture to showing that the
order of Donaldson-Thomas transformation divides into 2(h + h(cid:48)).
As we will see later in our paper, one of the quivers associated to the cluster Poisson variety Conf n(Pm−1)
is of the type An−m−1 (cid:2) Am−1 (Example 2.11). According to Keller ([Kel12], Lemma 3.7), the periodicty
conjecture for type (An−m−1, Am−1) can be reduced to showing the following.
Theorem 1.2. The cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation DT on Conf n(Pm−1) is of a period dividing
2n.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that DT2n[l1, . . . , ln] = [l1, . . . , ln] for a generic element [l1, . . . , ln]. From the
explicit formula of DT before Theorem 1.1 we see that DT2 : [l1, . . . , ln] (cid:55)→ [l1−m, l2−m, . . . , ln−m], which is
(cid:3)
just a cyclic shift by m. Therefore DT2n[l1, . . . , ln] = [l1, . . . , ln].

The second application of the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation of Conf n(Pm−1) is a proof of
Fock and Goncharov’s duality conjecture in the case of Grassmannian. It is an immediate corollary of our
main result combining with Theorem 0.10 of [GHKK14].

Finally, the geometric realization of the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation closely resembles what

is known as the parity conjugation for scattering amplitude in physics (see Appendix of [GGSVV13]).

1.3. A Variant of the Donaldson-Thomas Transformation for the Grassmannian. The conﬁg-
uration space Conf n(Pm−1) is closely related to the Grassmannian.
Indeed, consider an n-dimensional
complex vector space V with a given basis {ei}. Let Gr◦
n−m(V ) be the Zariski open subset of the Grass-
mannian Grn−m(V ) consisting of (n − m)-dimensional subspaces transverse to all coordinate hyperplanes
spanned by basis vectors ei. Then there is a natural map from Gr◦
n−m(V ) to the conﬁguration space
Conf n(Cm − {0}) := GLm\(Cm − {0})n given by

H (cid:55)→ (e1/H, . . . , en/H).

Note that the right hand side naturally sits inside Conf n((V /H) − {0}), which is canonically isomorphic
to Conf n(Cm − {0}). This map is in fact an isomorphism onto its image, which is a Zariski open subset
n(Cm−{0}) consisting of elements satisfying the totally generic condition (see Condition 2.5). Thus the
◦
Conf
Grassmannian Grn−m(V ) is canonically birationally equivalent to the conﬁguration space Conf n(Cm −{0}).
n(Cm − {0})
◦
The split algebraic torus (C∗)n acts on both sides of the isomorphism Gr◦
via (λi) : ei (cid:55)→ λiei, and it follows that this isomorphism is a (C∗)n-equivariant map. If we quotient out the

torus action on the right, we obtain a Zariski open subset of Conf n(Pm−1), which we denote as Conf
There is a natural lift of the Donaldson-Thomas transformation DT of Conf n(Pm−1) to Conf n(Cm − {0})
given by

n−m(V ) → Conf

where each ξi, expressed using a Hodge star operator (cid:63) on Cm, is deﬁned (up to a sign) as

DT : [v1, . . . , vn] (cid:55)→ [ξ1, . . . , ξn]

 (cid:94)



vj

ξi := (cid:63)

j∈[i−m+1,i−1]

(see (3.3) and (3.6) for details). Since Grn−m(V ) is canonically birationally equivalent to Conf n(Cm − {0}),
we can view this lifted map DT as the Donaldson-Thomas transformation of the Grassmannian Grn−m(V ).

1.4. Structure of the Paper. Section 2 contains basic deﬁnitions, constructions and propositions necessary
for the development of this paper: Subsection 2.1 discusses properties of the conﬁguration spaces Conf n(C−
{0}) and Conf n(Pm−1); Subsection 2.2 deﬁnes minimal bipartite graph and its related notions, which is a
slight modiﬁcation of Postnikov’s bipartite graph used in [Pos06]; Subsection 2.3 and 2.4 are brief reviews of
Fock and Goncharov’s cluster varieties and its related tropicalization, introduced in [FG03]; Subsection 2.4
will also contain the deﬁnition of cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation given by Goncharov and Shen in
[GS16]; Subsection 2.5 recalls Postnikov’s perfect orientations and boundary measurement maps in [Pos06],
and focuses on a special case which we call “special perfect orientation”.
Section 3 focuses on the involution ∗, which resembles the map ∗ introduced by Goncharov and Shen
in [GS16] and is closedly related to the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation. For self-containedness
purpose we will also include a proof of the birationally equivalence between Conf n(Pm−1) and a cluster
Poisson variety using the involutive property of ∗. Near the end of Section 3 we will give a nice coordinate
expression of the induced map ∗ on one particular seed X -torus.

Section 4 presents a detailed proof of our main theorem, which utilizes all the tools we have developed

throughout the paper.

ing the author to the subject of cluster theory and suggesting this problem on cluster Donaldson-Thomas
transformation, as well as all his insightful guidance throughout the process of solving this problem and

understanding the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation, and to thank Dylan Allegretti for his help on

[FG06], [FG11], the work of Goncharov and Shen [GS16], the work of Keller [Kel13], [Kel12], and the work of
Postnikov [Pos06]; without the work of all these pioneers in the ﬁeld this paper would not have been possible
otherwise.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Conﬁguration Space. We will discuss some basic properties of the conﬁguration spaces in this sub-
section.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G be a group and let X be a G-set (a set with a left G-action). The conﬁguration space
of n points on X is the quotient

Conf n(X) := G\X n

where G acts diagonally on X n.

In this paper we will be mainly focusing on two conﬁguration spaces Conf n(Cm−{0}) := GLm\(Cm−{0})n

and Conf n(Pm−1) := PGLm\(Pm−1)n.
Remark 2.2. Strictly speaking, these conﬁguration spaces are stacks rather than algebraic varieties. Since the
maps we deﬁne in this paper are all going to be deﬁned on the Zariski subsets satisfying the consecutively
generic condition as stated below, which are algebraic varieties, for the rest of this paper we will always
impose the consecutively generic condition on the conﬁguration spaces Conf n(Cm − {0}) and Conf n(Pm−1)
without further mentioning.
Condition 2.3. An element [v1, . . . , vn] (respectively [l1, . . . , ln]) of conﬁguration space Conf n(Cm − {0})
(respectively Conf n(Pm−1)) is said to satisfy the consecutively generic condition if vi, . . . , vi+m−1 (respec-
tively li, . . . , li+m−1) are in generic position for all i.

There is a natural (C∗)n−1-ﬁber bundle map

Conf n(Cm − {0}) → Conf n(Pm−1)

induced by the projectivization map Cm − {0} → Pm−1.

There is also a cyclic symmetry present in the conﬁguration spaces Conf n(Cm − {0}) and Conf n(Pm−1):
[l1, . . . , ln]) is in Conf n(Cm − {0}) (resp. Conf n(Pm−1)), then so is the point
[l2, . . . , ln, l1]). Using cyclic symmetry can reduce a proof of a statement about any
Let det be the standard volume form on Cm. For any m-element subset I of {1, . . . , n} we deﬁne the

→(cid:86) indicates that we take the wedge product with ascending indices. After quotienting out

where the notation
the GLm-action, the Pl¨ucker coordinates become “projective functions” on Conf n(Cm − {0}): they are only
well-deﬁned up to a global non-zero multiplicative constant. Note that ratios between Pl¨ucker coordinates
are still well-deﬁned rational functions on Conf n(Cm).

i∈I

If we would like to make Pl¨ucker coordinates more well-deﬁned, we can view them as regular functions

on the auxiliary space

(cid:93)Conf n(Cm) := SLm\(Cm − {0})n

(with consecutively generic condition imposed). We will call (cid:93)Conf n(Cm − {0}) the aﬃne cylinder over
Conf n(Cm − {0}). There is a C∗-ﬁber bundle map (cid:93)Conf n(Cm − {0}) → Conf n(Cm − {0}).
One important relation among the Pl¨ucker coordinates is the 3-term Pl¨ucker relation, which says that
for any (m − 2)-element subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , n} and any four elements i < j < k < l from J c, the following
equation always holds:

(2.4)

∆J∪{i,k}∆J∪{j,l} = ∆J∪{i,j}∆J∪{k,l} + ∆J∪{i,l}∆J∪{j,k}.

This relation can be easily remembered by the following square: the product of the two diagonals equals the
sum of two products of opposite sides.

To help us carry out proofs and computations, we often need to restrict ourselves to Zariski open subsets
of conﬁguration spaces consisting of elements that satisfy the totally generic condition as stated below, and
we will denote them by Conf
Condition 2.5. An element [v1, . . . , vn] (respectively [l1, . . . , ln]) of conﬁguration space Conf n(Cm − {0})
(respectively Conf n(Pm−1)) is said to satisfy the totally generic condition if for any m-element subset I of
{1, . . . , n}, elements of the subset {vi | i ∈ I} (respectivelyl {li | i ∈ I}) are in generic position.
2.2. Minimal Bipartite Graph. Postnikov studied bipartite graphs on a disk and the stratiﬁcation of
the non-negative Grassmannian in [Pos06]. We will use some modiﬁed versions of his ideas, such as perfect
orientation and boundary measurement map, as tools to prove our statements in this paper. Therefore we
think it would be helpful to include a subsection introducing the notion of minimal bipartite graphs for
future usage.

Let D be the closed unit disk on C with n marked points at the nth roots of unity labeled 1, . . . , n
clockwisely on the boundary. For any bipartite graph Γ drawn on D with exactly one edge connecting to
each marked point on the boundary, we can draw the so-called zig-zag strands on D going from one marked
point on the boundary to another, following the rules below.

(1) At each marked point on the boundary, the leaving zig-zag strand succeeds the arriving zig-zag

strand in the clockwise direction:

i

(2) Zig-zag strands travel next to edges in Γ.
(3) Zig-zag strands turn right at each black vertex and turn left at each white vertex; as a result, zig-
zag strands circulate in the counterclockwise direction around a black vertex and circulate in the
clockwise direction around a white vertex.

.

.

Deﬁnition 2.6. A minimal bipartite graph (of rank m) is a bipartite graph Γ on D with exactly one edge
connecting to each boundary marked point, satisfying the following conditions.

(1) Each of the zig-zag strands goes from a boundary marked point i to i + m.
(2) No zig-zag strand intersects inself in the interior of D.
(3) No two zig-zag strands form a parallel bigon.
(4) Black vertices are trivalent.
(5) Each edge connected to a marked point on the boundary is connecting to a white vertex at the other
end; we call such an edge an external edge and the white vertex to which an external edge connects
a boundary white vertex.

5

Remark 2.7. Among the conditions above, (4) and (5) are only for auxiliary purpose to make our proof
smoother; our results still hold for minimal bipartite graphs with conditions (4) and (5) dropped.

If we draw the zig-zag strands of a minimal bipartite graph Γ on D, tighten up the three strands sur-

rounding a black vertex to a triple intersection as below,

−→

and then forget Γ, what we get is an example of Thurston’s minimal triple diagram associated to the pairing
i (cid:55)→ i + m, introduced in his paper [Thu04]. In particular, Thurston’s results on minimal triple diagrams
can be turned into the following theorem on minimal bipartite graphs.

Theorem 2.8 (Thurston). Minimal bipartite graphs exist for any ﬁxed parameters m and n. Any two
minimal bipartite graphs with the same parameters m and n can be transformed into one another by a ﬁnite
sequence of the following two types of 2 ↔ 2 moves.

Part of Thurston’s theorem guarantees the existence of minimal bipartite graphs, but we also would like to
give an explicit construction for our paper. The following is a procedure to construct one for ﬁxed parameters

(4) Deform the graph by isotopy so that
the external edges match up with the
marked points on the boundary of D.

We give this minimal bipartite graph the special name Γ0. The minimal bipartite graph Γ0 is important to
many of our proofs: the general philosophy is that, whenever we want to show some property that is shared
by all minimal bipartite graphs, we ﬁrst show it on Γ0, and then verify that this property is invariant under
2 ↔ 2 moves, and conclude the proof by invoking Thurston’s theorem. The following are two examples of
such statements.

Proposition 2.9. Any minimal bipartite graph is connected.
Proof. This statement is obviously true for Γ0. Notice that a 2 ↔ 2 move does not disconnect a graph.
(cid:3)
Therefore the statement is true for all minimal bipartite graphs.

Proposition 2.10. In a minimal bipartite graph Γ, there is a one-to-one correspondence between marked
points on the boundary of D and boundary white vertices.
Proof. This statement is obviously true for Γ0. Notice that a 2 ↔ 2 move is a local move that never changes
the boundary white vertices or the external edge connecting to it. Therefore this statement is true for all
(cid:3)
minimal bipartite graphs.

Next we would like to present the canonical way of producing quivers from minimal bipartite graphs. To
start, we need to deﬁne what a face of a minimal bipartite graph Γ is: a face is just a connected component
of D − Γ as we all have imagined; in particular if a face is not totally enclosed by edges of Γ, we call it a
boundary face. To each minimal bipartite graph Γ we can construct two quivers ˜i and i; let’s ﬁrst describe
the construction of ˜i.

(1) Put a vertex for each face of Γ.
(2) Put a counterclockwisely oriented 3-cycle for the faces next to a black vertex as below.

(3) Remove any 2-cycles in the quiver.

7

After constructing ˜i, the quiver i is then obtained from ˜i by removing all the vertices corresponding to
boundary faces and all the arrows involving those vertices. Because i does not have any vertex corresponding
to boundary faces, we also call it the boundary-removed quiver associated to Γ.

Example 2.11. Starting from the special minimal bipartite graph Γ0 as described above, we obtain the
following corresponding quivers, and by convention we will denote them as ˜i0 and i0 respectively. One can
see right away that i0 is indeed of type An−m−1 (cid:2) Am−1, as claimed in our short proof of the corresponding
case of the periodicity conjecture (Theorem 1.2).

If we draw the associated quivers for two minimal bipartite graphs which diﬀer by a 2 ↔ 2 move, we see
that a type I 2 ↔ 2 move is the same as a quiver mutation at the vertex corresponding to the center face,
whereas a type II 2 ↔ 2 move does not change the associated quiver at all. Relating this observation back
to Thurston’s theorem, we obtain the following corollary of Thurston’s theorem.
Corollary 2.12 (Thurston). If i and i(cid:48) (resp. ˜i and ˜i(cid:48)) are the quivers associated to two minimal bipartite
graphs Γ and Γ(cid:48) with the same parameters m and n, then i(cid:48) (resp. ˜i(cid:48)) can be obtained from i (resp. ˜i) by a
sequence of quiver mutations corresponding to the sequence of 2 ↔ 2 moves which turns Γ into Γ(cid:48) given by
Thurston’s theorem.

The last part of our introduction to minimal bipartite graphs is on the notion of dominating sets.

Deﬁnition 2.13. Let Γ be a minimal bipartite graph. We denote the zig-zag strand going from i to i + m
by ζi. We say that a face f of Γ is dominated by the zig-zag strand ζi if f lies on the left of ζi, and we deﬁne
the dominating set I(f ) to be the collection of indices i for which ζi dominate f .

Proposition 2.14. Let Γ be a minimal bipartite graph. If we denote the boundary face clockwisely succeeding
the boundary marked point i as fi, then I(fi) = [i − m + 1, i], where the notation [i, j] is deﬁned to be

(cid:26) {i, i + 1, . . . , j}

[i, j] :=

{i, i + 1, . . . , n, 1, . . . , j}

if i < j;
if i > j.

Proof. This follows from the deﬁnition of dominating sets.

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.15. Let Γ be a minimal bipartite graph, then the dominating set of each face is of size m.

Proof. Note that we always cross two opposite strands to go from one face to the adjacent face across an
(cid:3)
edge; therefore all dominating sets are of the same size, which is m by looking at the boundary faces.

Proposition 2.16. Let ˜i be the quiver associated to a minimal bipartite graph Γ. If f is not a boundary
face of Γ, then the multiplicity of any element i ∈ {1, . . . , n} occurring in all I(g) as g runs over all faces
pointing to f in ˜i is equal to the multiplicity of any element i ∈ {1, . . . , n} occurring in all I(h) as h runs
over all faces being pointed to by f in ˜i.

(cid:3)
Proof. Just verify it carefully with pictures.
Proposition 2.17. A Type II 2 ↔ 2 move does not change the dominating set of any face, and a Type I
2 ↔ 2 move changes the dominating sets only locally, and the change is as follows, where J is a (m − 2)-
element subset of {1, . . . , n} − {i, j, k, l}.

If we compare the local change of dominating sets under a Type I 2 ↔ 2 move with the indices of the
3-term Pl¨ucker relation (2.4), we see that they actually match up! This is one of the keys to relate the
conﬁguration space Conf n(Cm − {0}) to the cluster variety A|i0|.

2.3. Cluster Variety. We will give a brief review of Fock and Goncharov’s theory of cluster ensemble, and
relate it to our geometric example, namely the conﬁguration spaces Conf n(Cm − {0}) and Conf n(Pm−1).
We will mainly follow the coordinate description presented in [FG03] with skewsymmetric exchange matrix
and no frozen vertices.

Deﬁnition 2.18. A seed i is an ordered pair (I, ) where I is a ﬁnite set and  is a skewsymmetric matrix
whose rows and columns are indexed by I.

The data of a seed as deﬁned above is equivalent to the data of a quiver with vertex set I and exchange
matrix ij. We will make no distinctions between seeds and quivers in this paper, and hence we always use
the seed notation to denote any quiver.

The notion of quiver mutation can be described by a precise formula in the seed language: for an element

k ∈ I, the seed mutation µk gives a new seed (I(cid:48), (cid:48)) where I(cid:48) = I and

ij + |ik|kj

if k ∈ {i, j};
if ikkj ≤ 0 and k /∈ {i, j};
if ikkj > 0, k /∈ {i, j}.

Starting with an initial seed i0, we say that a seed i is mutation equivalent to i0 if there is a sequence
of seed mutation that turns i0 into i; we denote the set of all seeds mutation equivalent to i0 by |i0|. To
each seed i in |i0| we associate two split algebraic tori Ai = (C∗)|I| and Xi = (C∗)|I|, which are equipped
with canonical coordinates (Ai) and (Xi) indexed by the set I respectively. These two split algebraic tori
are linked by a map pi : Ai → Xi given by

.

The split algebraic tori Ai and Xi are called a seed A-torus and a seed X -torus respectively.
A seed mutation µk : i → i(cid:48) gives rise to birational equivalences between the corresponding seed A-tori
and the corresponding seed X -tori respectively, both of which by an abuse of notation we also denote as µk;
in terms of the canonical coordinates (A(cid:48)

Besides cluster mutations between seed tori we also care about cluster isomorphisms induced by seed
(quiver) isomorphisms. A seed isomorphism σ : i → i(cid:48) is a bijection σ : I → I(cid:48) such that (cid:48)
σ(i)σ(j) = ij.
Given a seed isomorphism σ : i → i(cid:48) between two seeds in |i0|, we obtain isomorphisms on the corresponding
seed tori, which by an abuse of notation we also denote by σ, deﬁned by

σ∗(Aσ(i)) = Ai

and

σ∗(Xσ(i)) = Xi.

Compositions of seed mutations and seed isomorhpisms are called seed cluster transformations, and com-
positions of cluster mutations and cluster isomorphisms are called cluster transformations. A seed cluster
transformation transformation i → i is called trivial if it induces identity maps on the coresponding seed
A-torus Ai and seed X -torus Xi.
By gluing the seed tori with cluster mutations we obtain the corresponding cluster varieties, which will be
denoted as A|i0| and X|i0| respectively. Then cluster transformations can be seen as automorphisms on these

describe in the next subsection.

Due to the positivity of the mutation formulas, we can tropicalize these cluster varieties, which we will
Since the maps pi commute with cluster mutations, they naturally glue into a map p : A|i0| → X|i0| of
For the rest of this subsection we will link the cluster varieties A|˜i0| and X|i0| associated to the initial seeds
˜i0 and i0 given in last subsection to the conﬁguration spaces Conf n(Cm−{0}) and Conf n(Pm−1) respectively.
Consider any minimal bipartite graph Γ with ﬁxed parameters m and n satisfying 1 < m < m + 1 < n.
We know from Proposition 2.15 that the size of dominating sets I(f ) is always m for every face f of Γ.
Therefore to each face f of Γ we can deﬁne a rational function Af : (cid:93)Conf n(Cm − {0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) C∗ by

Af [v1, . . . , vn] := ∆I(f )[v1, . . . , vn].

These rational functions Af then give rise to a rational map

˜ψi : (cid:93)Conf n(Cm − {0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) A˜i.

Let’s investigate how ˜ψi and ˜ψi(cid:48) relate to each other for two minimal bipartite graphs Γ and Γ(cid:48) with the
same parameters m and n. On the one hand, Corollary 2.12 tells us that Γ and Γ(cid:48) can be related by a
sequence of 2 ↔ 2 moves, which induces a sequence of mutations on the corresponding quivers ˜i and ˜i(cid:48) at
non-boundary faces. On the other hand, we know from Proposition 2.17 that a Type II 2 ↔ 2 move does not
change the dominating set of any face, and a Type I 2 ↔ 2 move changes the dominating sets locally within
the indices of the 3-term Pl¨ucker relation; in fact if we compare the 3-term Pl¨ucker relation (2.4) with the
cluster A-mutation formula induced by a Type I 2 ↔ 2 move, we see that they are exactly the same! This
proves the following proposition.

Proposition 2.19. The maps ˜ψi : (cid:93)Conf n(Cm−{0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) A˜i glue into a rational map ˜ψ : (cid:93)Conf n(Cm−{0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75)
A|˜i0|.

Next let’s put in the X -picture. Let ˜p : A|˜i0| → X|˜i0| be the p map between cluster varieties. By
comparing ˜i and i we see that there is a projection qi : X˜i → Xi which projects the split algebraic torus X˜i
to its non-boundary face factors. It is not hard to see that this projection map also commutes with any
cluster X -mutation µk taking place at a vertex k of i. Thus the maps qi glue into a map of cluster varieties
q : X|˜i0| → X|i0|.

2.4. Tropicalization, Lamination, and Cluster Donaldson-Thomas Transformation. In this sub-
section we will discuss tropicalization of cluster varieties and the laminations on them. Near the end we will
use laminations to give a deﬁnition of Goncharov and Shen’s cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation.
Let’s start with a split algebraic torus X . The semiring of positive rational functions on X , which we
denote as P (X ), is the semiring consisting of elements in the form f /g where f and g are linear combinations
of characters on X with positive integral coeﬃcients. A rational map φ : X (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Y between two split algebraic
tori is said to be positive if it induces a semiring homomorphism φ∗ : P (Y) → P (X ). It then follows that
composition of positive rational maps is still a positive rational map.
One typical example of a positive rational map is a cocharacter χ of a split algebraic torus X : the induced
(cid:104)f,χ(cid:105)
(cid:104)g,χ(cid:105) in P (C∗), where (cid:104)f, χ(cid:105) and (cid:104)g, χ(cid:105) are understood as linear
map χ∗ pulls back an element f /g ∈ P (X ) to
extensions of the canonical pairing between characters and cocharacters with values in powers of z. We will
denote the lattice of cocharacters of a split algebraic torus X by X t for reasons that will become clear in a
moment.
Note that P (C∗) is the semiring of rational functions in a single variable z with positive integral coeﬃcients.
Thus if we let Zt be the semiring (Z, max, +), then there is a semiring homomorphism degz : P (C∗) → Zt
deﬁned by f (z)/g(z) (cid:55)→ degz f − degz g. Therefore a cocharacter χ on X gives rise to a natural semiring
homomorphism

degz(cid:104)·, χ(cid:105) : P (X ) → Zt

Proposition 2.20. The map χ (cid:55)→ degz(cid:104)·, χ(cid:105) is a bijection between the lattice of cocharacters and set of
semiring homomorphisms from P (X ) to Zt.
Proof. Note that P (X ) is a free commutative semiring generated by any basis of the lattice of characters,
i=1. Therefore to deﬁne a semiring homomorphism from P (X )
and in paricular any choice of coordinates (Xi)r
to Zt we just need to assign to each Xi some integer ai. But for any collection of (ai) there exists a unique
cocharacter χ such that (cid:104)Xi, χ(cid:105) = zai. Therefore χ (cid:55)→ degz(cid:104)·, χ(cid:105) is indeed a bijection.
(cid:3)
Corollary 2.21. A positive rational map φ : X (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Y between split algebraic tori gives rise to a natural
map φt : X t → Y t between the respective lattice of cocharacters.
Proof. Note that φ induces a semiring homomorphism φ∗ : P (Y) → P (X ). Therefore for any cochcaracter
χ of X , the map f (cid:55)→ degz(cid:104)φ∗f, χ(cid:105) is a semiring homomorphism from P (Y) → Zt. By the above proposition
there is a unique cocharacter η of Y representing this semiring homomorphism, and we assign φt(χ) = η. (cid:3)

We may also want to give an explicit formula for the induced map φt. To do so, let’s ﬁx two coordinate
charts (Xi) on X and (Yj) on Y. Then (Xi) gives rise to a basis {ei} of the lattice of cocharacters X t, which
is deﬁned by

This basis allows us to write each cocharacter χ of X as a linear combination(cid:80) xiei. It is not hard to see

function q in r varibles Xi, . . . , Xr we have the so-called na¨ıve tropicalization, which turns q into a map from
Zr to Z via the following process:

(1) replace addition in q(Xi) by taking maximum;
(2) replace multiplication in q(Xi) by addition and replace division in q(Xi) by subtraction;
(3) replace every constant term by zero;
(4) replace Xi by xi.

It is not hard to see that, given a positive rational map φ : X (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Y, the induced map φt maps(cid:80) xiei to
(cid:80) yjfj where

(2.22)

yj := (φ∗(Yj))t(xi).

12

From this proposition and its proof we get out many important constructions. First we deﬁne the tropi-
calization of a split algebraic torus X to be its lattice of cocharacters X t (and hence the notation). Second
given a positive rational map φ : X (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Y between split algebraic tori, we deﬁne its tropicalization to be
the map φt : X t → Y t. Third given an isomorphism X ∼= (C∗)r of split algebraic tori, we not only obtain a
coordinate system (Xi) on X but also a basis {ei} of X t, which we call the basic laminations associated to
(Xi).
Now we can go back to the cluster varieties A|i0| and X|i0|. Since both cluster varieties are obtained by
gluing seed tori via positive birational equivalences, we can tropicalize everything and obtain two new glued
objects which we call tropicalized cluster varieties and denote as At|i0| and X t|i0|.
Since each seed X -torus Xi is given a split algebraic torus, it has a set of basic laminations associated to
the canonical coordinates (Xi); we will call this set of basic laminations the positive basic X -laminations and

With all the terminologies developed, we can now state the deﬁnition of Goncharov and Shen’s cluster

Donaldson-Thomas transformation as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.23 (Deﬁnition 2.15 in [GS16]). A cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation (on a seed X -
torus Xi) is a cluster transformation DT : Xi (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Xi whose induced tropical cluster X -transformation

Goncharov and Shen proved that a cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation enjoys the following prop-

erties.

Theorem 2.24 (Goncharov-Shen, Theorem 2.16 in [GS16]). A cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation
DT : Xi → Xi is unique if it exists. If i(cid:48) is another seed in |i| (the collection of seeds mutation equivalent to
i) and τ : X i → Xi(cid:48) is a cluster tranformation, then the conjugate τ DTτ−1 is the cluster Donaldson-Thomas
transformation in Xi(cid:48). Therefore it makes sense to say the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation DT
exists on a cluster X -variety without refering to any one particular seed X -torus.

From our discussion on tropicalization above, we can translate the deﬁnition of a cluster Donaldson-
Thomas transformation into the following equivalent one, which we will use to prove the existence of cluster
Donaldson-Thomas transformation on Conf n(Pm−1) in Section 4.
Proposition 2.25. A cluster transformation DT : Xi → Xi is a cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation
if and only if

2.5. Special Perfect Orientation and Boundary Measurement Map. Perfect orientations and bound-
ary measurement maps are introduced by Postnikov in his work on the non-negative Grassmannian [Pos06].
What we call special perfect orientation in this paper is a special case of his perfect orientation and hence
the name. To begin, we deﬁne Postnikov’s perfect orientation as below.

Deﬁnition 2.26. A perfect orientation on a minimal bipartite graph is a choice of orientations on the edges
of the minimal bipartite graph, such that every white vertex has only one in-coming edge and every black
vertex has only one out-going edge. Given a perfect orientation on a minimal bipartite graph, we call a
marked point on the boundary of D a source of that perfect orientation if the external edge connecting it to
a white vertex is oriented towards that white vertex; otherwise we call it a sink of that perfect orientation.

13

Perfect orientation on a given minimal bipartite graph is highly non-unique, and they may even have

oriented cycles. The following are two perfect orientations on the same minimal bipartite graph.

Although perfect orientations are not unique, there are some combinatorial invariants to it. For example

we have the following observation.

Proposition 2.27. If Γ is a minimal bipartite graph associated to σ, then any perfect orientation on Γ has
exactly m sources.

Proof. By simple combinatorial counting we see that the number of sources of a perfect orientation is equal
to 2B + W − I where B, W and I are the numbers of black vertices, white vertices, and internal edges
respectively. So it suﬃces to show that m = 2B + W − I.

ζ

Now consider a zig-zag strand ζ and the part of Γ that it dominates. It looks like the above picture. If
we cut along the dashed arrow, then the part on the left of that dashed arrow is again a bipartite graph
on a disk with external edges (not necessarily minimal, however). If we view a graph on a disk as some
decomposition of the disk into 0-cells (vertices), 1-cells (edges) and 2-cells (faces), then Euler characteristic
tells us that

V − E + F = 1

where V , E, and F are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of that graph respectively (we are not
counting the boundary marked points and the boundary arcs between them because they cancel out each
other exactly). Now by considering all n zig-zag strands and the parts that we cut out as described above,
we have n bipartite graphs on disks. For these n bipartite graphs, we have counted each face m times (since
the dominating set of each face is m by Proposition 2.15), each black vertex m − 2 times, each white vertex
m − 1 times, and each edge m − 1 times. By summing up all the n Euler characteristics we get

(m − 2)B + (m − 2)W − (m − 1)(I + n) + mF = n.

On the other hand, computing the Euler characteristic for the minimal bipartite graph Γ itself, we get

B + W − (I + n) + F = 1.

Eliminate F from these two equations we then obtain m = 2B + W − I.

(cid:3)

For the rest of this subection we will introduce a particular type of perfect orientations on a minimal

bipartite graph, which we call the special perfect orientation.

Remark 2.28. Before we go into the details, we need to point out that because the special perfect orientation
relies on the linear ordering on {1, . . . , n} inherited from Z, it breaks the cyclic symmetry in our story that
we have so far. But this is okay because one can replace the linear ordering < with <t deﬁned by

t <t t + 1 <t ··· <t n <t 1 <t ··· <t t − 1.

Therefore all statements and constructions using special perfect orientations are cyclically equivalent.

14

To deﬁne a perfect orientation on a minimal bipartite graph, it suﬃces to state a way of assigning
orientation for the three edges connected to a black vertex (recall that black vertices in a minimal bipartite
graph is trivalent). Under our trivalent assumption, a typical black vertex is surrounded by three zig-zag
strands as follows.

ζi

ζj

ζk

and if i < j < k, then

Due to the non-existence of parallel bigon, i, j, and k must be in clockwise order on the boundary of D.
Therefore once we impose the linear ordering < on {1, . . . , n} inherited from Z, one and only one of the
following three must be true: i < j < k, j < k < i, or k < i < j. We then ﬁnd the middle one among i, j,
and k with respect to the linear ordering <, say j, and declare that the edge opposite to ζj to be out-going
from the black vertex. We claim that the orientations on all other edges of Γ are then uniquely determined
by bipartity and the conditions that each black vertex has only one out-going edge and each white vertex
has only one in-coming edge. To prove this claim, it suﬃces to show the following.

Proposition 2.29. Any white vertex indeed has exactly one in-coming edge.

Proof. First by the minimality condition on minimal triple diagrams, the lower indices of the zig-zag strands
passing next to a white vertex must be in a clockwise order; hence with respect to the linear order < we
must have i1 < i2 < ··· < ik in the following picture.

ζi2

...

ζik

ζi1

ζj

ζik−1

But as we see from the construction of the special perfect orientation, in order for an internal edge to go
into a white vertex, the lower index of the zig-zag strand clockwisely succeeding the internal edge must be
smaller than that of the zig-zag strand clockwisely proceeding the same internal edge. This happens only
between ζi1 and ζik . Therefore if the edge between ζi1 and ζik is internal then we have one in-coming edge
to the center white vertex; otherwise the edge between ζi1 and ζik is external and all other edges are internal
(Proposition 2.10), and we can just declare that the external edge is an in-coming edge to the center white
(cid:3)
vertex.

Next we are going to prove a couple important properties of special perfect orientations.

Proposition 2.30. There is no oriented cycle in the special perfect orientation.

Proof. First let’s show that no boundary of a face is oriented under the special perfect orientation. Assume
that f is a face with oriented boundary; without loss of generality let’s assume that the boundary of f is
clockwisely oriented. Then at any black vertex at the boundary of f , such as the follow one, we must have
i < j.

15

ζj

ζi

Since this must hold for every black vertex at the boundary of f , the lower indices of zig-zag strands that
go counter clockwisely around f will be in a cyclic order with respect to the linear order <, which is absurd.
Therefore no boundary of a single face is oriented.

Now suppose we have some oriented cycle under the special perfect orientation. Then it must bound a
region with more than one face. In particular, at some vertex of this oriented cycle there must be some
edge going into the bounded region inside. Fix such an edge, which may orient inward or outward under the
special perfect orientation; the proof of either case is analogous, so without loss of generality let’s assume
that it is oriented inward. Since each vertex, regardless of the color, has at least one out-going edge, we can
follow this inward pointing edge and continue into some path inside the oriented cycle.

But since there are only ﬁnitely many edges inside the oriented cycle, we must end with one of the following
two cases: either the path closes up and give us a smaller oriented cycle bounding fewer faces (left), or
it exists the interior and connects back to the oriented cycle (right). Either way we will end up with an
oriented cycle bounding fewer faces, and the proof is complete by induction on the number of faces that it
(cid:3)
bounds.

Proposition 2.31. If Γ is a minimal bipartite graph, then the source set of the special perfect orientation
is always [1, m] (recall that we have the notation convention [1, m] := {1, . . . , m}).

16

Proof. Let’s start by showing that the statement holds for the minimal bipartite graph Γ0. By carefully
comparing the zig-zag strands, we ﬁnd that the special perfect orientation on Γ0 takes the following form.

m

m − 1

...

2

1

···

...

···

···

n

··· m + 3 m + 2 m + 1

In fact the faces of Γ0 are in fact in bijection with the cells in an m × (n − m) array of cells, and the special
perfect orientation on Γ0 can be easily remembered by the following orientations on the edges of m× (n− m)
array of cells.

m

m − 1

...

1

···

···

...
···
···

n

m + 2 m + 1

On the other hand, it can be verify that a 2 ↔ 2 move never changes the sources and sinks (not even locally)
and hence the source sets of the special perfect orientations on all minimal bipartite graphs are the same.
Then the proof is ﬁnished because we see above that [1, m] is the source set of the special perfect orientation
(cid:3)
on Γ0.

Now we turn to the second topic of this subsection, which is the Postnikov’s boundary measurement map.
Consider a minimal bipartite graph Γ with its special perfect orientation. A path γ from a source i to a sink
j in the special perfect orientation is a ﬁnite collection of consecutive edges in Γ with compatible orientations
starting with the external edge leaving i and ending with the external edge going into j. We denote a path in
the special perfect orientation going from i to j by γ : i → j. Note that since the special perfect orientation
has no oriented cycles and there are only ﬁnitely many edges in a minimal bipartite graph, there are only
ﬁnitely many paths from any given source to any given sink.

Given a path γ on Γ, we say that a face f of Γ is dominated by γ if it lies on the right of γ with respect

to the orientation of γ. We denote the set of faces dominated by γ by ˆγ.
Deﬁnition 2.32. Let Γ be a minimal bipartite graph on D and let ˜i be the corresponding quiver. For
i ∈ [1, m] and j ∈ [m + 1, n], we deﬁne the boundary measurement function ˜χij
i to be the polynomial function
on the seed X -torus X˜i given by

˜χij

i (Xf ) :=

(cid:88)

(cid:89)

Xf .

γ:i→j

f∈ˆγ

Using the boundary measurement functions, we deﬁne the boundary measurement map ˜χi as

˜χi : X˜i

(cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Conf n(Cm − {0})

17

where

Mij =

(Xf ) (cid:55)→ [Mij],

(cid:26) δij

(−1)m−i ˜χij

i (Xf )

if 1 ≤ j ≤ m;
if m + 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Remark 2.33. It is not clear from this construction that some [Mij] can possibly be inside Conf n(Cm −{0}),
so one may now just regard ˜χi as a map from X˜i to Matm,n. Later as an immediate corollary of Proposition
3.5, we see that the image of ˜χi in fact intersect Conf n(Cm −{0}) in a Zariski open subset, and ˜χi is actually
a dominant rational map.

Remark 2.34. Postnikov’s original treatment of the boundary measurement functions includes a sign factor
depending on the winding number of a path, and the set of dominated faces lie on the left instead of on the
right. In this paper we change the set of dominated faces to the other side to better suit our construction,
and since we showed that a special perfect orientation has no oriented cycles (Proposition 2.30), all paths
have vanishing winding number and hence we do not need that sign factor.

3. The Map ∗

When Goncharov suggested the study of the cluster Donaldson-Thomas tranformation on Conf n(Pm−1),
the map ∗ was the ﬁrst map that the author constructed as a potential candidate. As it turns out, the map
∗, in some sense, is “too nice” to be the cluster Donaldson-Thomas transformation. Yet the map ∗ has many
beautiful properties and the proof of the main theorem of this paper relies heavily on properties of ∗. We
will introduce the map ∗ and prove some of its properties in this section.
3.1. Deﬁnition and Construction. Let’s give a geometric deﬁnition of the map ∗ ﬁrst. Recall that for
a generic point (l1, . . . , ln) ∈ (Pm−1)n we use the notation h[i,i+m−2] to denote the deﬁning dual line in
(Pm−1)∨ of the hyperplane spanned by li, . . . , li+m−2. After quotienting out the projectively linear group
actions, we know that Conf n(Pm−1) is naturally isomorphic to Conf n((Pm−1)∨), and hence we can deﬁne
the following map.
Deﬁnition 3.1. The map ∗ : Conf n(Pm−1) → Conf n(Pm−1) is deﬁned by

∗ : [l1, . . . , ln] (cid:55)→(cid:2)h[1,m−1], h[n,m−2], . . . , h[2,m]

(cid:3) .

For the rest of this subsection, we will give an alternative deﬁnition of the map ∗ using cluster language,

which is the key in proving many interesting properties of the map ∗.
Fix a minimal bipartite graph Γ with parameters m and n. Let ˜i be its corresponding quiver. We have
learned from the introduction that there is a rational map ˜ψi : (cid:93)Conf n(Cm − {0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) A˜i, and there is
a natural p map ˜pi : A˜i → X˜i. Since every vertex in the quiver ˜i associated to Γ has an equal number
of in-coming arrows and out-going arrows, the composition ˜pi ◦ ˜ψi is actually constant along the ﬁber
(cid:93)Conf n(Cm − {0}) → Conf n(Cm − {0}) and hence can be passed down to a rational map

˜pi ◦ ˜ψi : Conf n(Cm − {0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) X˜i.

Next we need a reﬂection map ˜r : Conf n(Cm − {0}) → Conf n(Cm − {0}) deﬁned by

˜r : [v1, . . . , vn] (cid:55)→ [vm, . . . , v1, vn, . . . , vm+1]

Deﬁnition 3.2. The map ∗i : Conf n(Cm − {0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Conf n(Cm − {0}) is the rational map deﬁned to be the
composition of the following sequence of maps:

Conf n(Cm − {0})

˜pi◦ ˜ψi

/ X˜i

˜χi

/ Conf n(Cm − {0})

˜r

/ Conf n(Cm − {0}) .

Such a deﬁnition of the ∗i may seem a bit arbitrary, so our next goal is to convince our readers that this
n(Cm − {0}) consisting of totally generic elements. It follows that

n(Cm − {0}).
◦

deﬁnition is rationally equivalent to the geometric deﬁnition we gave in Deﬁnition 3.1.
˜pi ◦ ˜ψi is a well-deﬁned regular map on Conf

n(Cm − {0}). Let [v1, . . . , vn] be a point in Conf

By simple counting we know that the dominating set I(w) of each white vertex w in Γ is of size m − 1.
Therefore for each white vertex w we can deﬁne a linear functional ξw ∈ (Cm)∨ by

 →(cid:94)

vi

i∈I(w)

 ∧ v

 .

ξw(v) := det

Note that since I(w) ⊂ I(f ) for any neighboring face f , it follows that ξw (cid:54)= 0 for any w.

Then we make the following observation. Consider a black vertex in Γ connecting to three white vertices

r, s, and t, with zig-zag stands ζi, ζj, and ζk, and faces f , g, and h around, arranged as follows.

f

ζj

t

From the picture we see that all three dominating sets I(r), I(s), and I(t) share a same m− 2 element subset
J, with I(r) = J ∪ {i}, I(s) = J ∪ {j}, and I(t) = J ∪ {k}. Without loss of generality we assume that
i < j < k. For a = i, j, k, we deﬁne νa := {b ∈ J | b > a}. Then we observe the following.

Af (v1, . . . , vn) = (−1)νk ξs(vk) = (−1)νj +1ξt(vj);
Ag(v1, . . . , vn) = (−1)νi+1ξt(vi) = (−1)νk ξr(vk);
Ah(v1, . . . , vn) = (−1)νj ξr(vj) = (−1)νi+1ξs(vi).

If we deﬁne another linear functional

η := Af (v1, . . . , vn)ξr − Ag(v1, . . . , vn)ξs + Ah(v1, . . . , vn)ξt.

Then obviously the inner product of η with any element in {vl | l ∈ J ∪ {i, j, k}} vanishes; but the right
hand side is actually a spanning set of Cm, and hence we can conclude that

ξs =

Af (v1, . . . , vn)
Ag(v1, . . . , vn)

ξr +

Ah(v1, . . . , vn)
Ag(v1, . . . , vn)

ξt.

The coeﬃcients look familiar: they are part of Xf Xg and Xf respectively, and this will link us to the star
map.

Let wi be the boundary white vertex to which the marked point i on the boundary is connected to; then

we associate to i the linear functional

(3.3)
Proposition 3.4. For any j ∈ {m + 1, . . . , n}, we have

ξi :=

ξwi

if 1 ≤ i ≤ m;
if m + 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

ξj =

(−1)m−i ˜ψij

i (Xf ) ξi,

where (Xf ) := ˜pi ◦ ˜ψi[v1, . . . , vn].
Proof. If we start from a sink j and go against the special perfect orientation on Γ and repeatly use the

i=1

Af (v1, . . . , vn)
Ag(v1, . . . , vn)

Ah(v1, . . . , vn)
Ag(v1, . . . , vn)

ξt at each black vertex, we obtain an expansion of ξj in terms
identity ξs =
of the vectors {ξi | i ∈ [1, m]} which agrees with the expression of the boundary measurement map ˜ψi. (cid:3)

ξr +

19

The above proposition is inspiring. First note that by Equation (3.3), ξi can be deﬁned entirely based upon
vi, so the conﬁguration [ξ1, . . . , ξn] = ˜χi(Xf ) actually does not depend on the choice of minimal bipartite
graph Γ; hence it makes sense to drop the index i and instead write (with an abuse of notation)

∗ : Conf n(Cm − {0}) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Conf n(Cm − {0})

[v1, . . . , vn] (cid:55)→ [ξm, . . . , ξ1, ξn, . . . , ξm+1]

Second, we see that ξi is in fact a dual vector corresponding to the hyperplane spanned by vi−1, . . . , vi−m+1
(indices are taken modulo n), so we almost recover the geometric deﬁnition (Deﬁnition 3.1)! All we have
to do next is to projectivize ∗, and then we obtain back the deﬁnition of ∗ we had at the beginning of this
section:

∗ : Conf n(Pm−1) → Conf n(Pm−1)

[l1, l2, . . . , ln] (cid:55)→(cid:2)h[1,m−1], h[n,m−2], . . . , h[2,m]

(cid:3) .

(Recall that h[i,m+i−2] denotes the dual line corresponding to the hyperplane spanned by the lines li, . . . , lm+i−2,
where the indices are taken modulo n.)
As Remark 2.33 pointed out, so far we haven’t proved that the image of the boundary measurement map
˜χi or the image of ∗, has non-trivial intersection with the conﬁguration spaces. Thus we need to add in the
following supplementary proposition.
Proposition 3.5. If [v1, . . . , vn] is a point in Conf n(Cm − {0}) then so is [ξm, . . . , ξ1, ξn, ξm+1], where ξi
are deﬁned by Equation (3.3).
Proof. By cyclic symmetry, it suﬃces to show that {ξm, . . . , ξ1} is a basis of (Cm)∨. Let (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) be the standard
inner product on Cm, which gives rise to an identiﬁcation between (Cm)∨ and Cm (hence the volume form

det can be applied to (Cm)∨ too) as well as a Hodge dual operator (cid:63) :(cid:86)m−k Cm →(cid:86)k Cm. Then up to a

sign, we can write

(3.6)

ξi = (cid:63)

 (cid:94)

j∈[i−m+1,i−1]

 .

vj

The statement is then reduced to showing that det(ξ1, . . . , ξm) (cid:54)= 0. To save our energy, we do the rest of
the proof up to a sign as well:
det (ξ1 ∧ ··· ∧ ξm)

= det ((cid:63)(vn ∧ ··· ∧ v2−m) ∧ (cid:63)(v1 ∧ ··· ∧ v3−m) ∧ ··· ∧ (cid:63)(vm−1 ∧ ··· ∧ v1))
=(cid:104)(cid:63)(vn ∧ ··· ∧ v2−m) ∧ (cid:63)(v1 ∧ ··· ∧ v3−m) ∧ ··· ∧ (cid:63)(vm−2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn), vm−1 ∧ ··· ∧ v1(cid:105) .

Now we need to pair up each dual vector on the left with each vector on the right in all possible non-vanishing
ways. First consider v1 at the far right end; on the left, the only dual vector that does not annihilate v1 is
(cid:63)(vn ∧ ··· ∧ v2−m). Second consider v2 and the only factor other than the ﬁrst factor on the left that does
not annihilate v2 is the second factor (cid:63)(v1 ∧ ··· ∧ v3−m)... As we go through all the vectors from right to
left, we see that at each step there is only one possible non-vanishing pairing, which is to pair up the left
and right in a reverse order.
The problem is now reduced to showing that each factor is not vanishing. Let’s take the ﬁrst one (cid:104)(cid:63)(vn ∧
··· ∧ v2−m), v1(cid:105) for example. Recall that the square of the Hodge dual operator is the identity up to a sign.
Thus we have the following up to a sign computation:

(cid:104)(cid:63)(vn ∧ ··· ∧ v2−m), v1(cid:105) =(cid:104)v1, (cid:63)(vn ∧ ··· ∧ v2−m)(cid:105)

= det(v1 ∧ (cid:63)2(vn ∧ ··· ∧ v2−m)(cid:105)
= det(v1 ∧ vn ∧ ··· ∧ v2−m)
= det(v2−m ∧ ··· ∧ vn ∧ v1)
=∆[2−m,1].

(cid:3)

The following proposition gives us a clear idea of the relation between the two ∗ maps:

20

Proposition 3.7. The following diagram commutes. The two vertical maps are (C∗)n−1-ﬁber bundle maps.
The bottom map is an involution.

Conf n(Cm − {0})

Conf n(Pm−1)

∗

∗

Conf n(Cm − {0})

/ Conf n(Pm−1)

Proof. The commutativity and ﬁber bundle maps follows easily from the fact that the bottom map is ob-
tained by projectivizing the top map. The fact that the bottom map is an involution follows from simple
(cid:3)
computation using Deﬁnition 3.1.
3.2. Birational Equivalence. As a byproduct of the involutive nature of the map ∗, we give a proof of the
birational equivalence between the conﬁguration space Conf n(Pm−1) and the cluster variety X|i0|. Readers
are welcome to skip this subsection if they are familiar with this fact. The key is to show that Conf n(Pm−1)
is birationally equivalent to any seed torus Xi, since by construction X|i0| is birationally equivalent to any
one of its seed torus.
We start with deﬁning a rational map χi : Xi (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Conf n(Pm−1) by the commutativity of the following

diagram.

X˜i

Xi

˜χi

Conf n(Cm − {0})

/ Conf n(Pm−1)

χi

Since this deﬁnition involves a lifting, we need to show well-deﬁnedness before we do anything else.

Proposition 3.8. The rational map χi is well-deﬁned.

Proof. Note that the lifting in the deﬁnition of χi is the same as assigning some non-zero complex numbers
to the boundary face variables of Γ. Thus it suﬃces to show that adjusting boundary face variables of Γ
does not move the image of ˜χi across diﬀerent ﬁbers of Conf n(Cm − {0}) → Conf n(Pm−1). For notation
simplicity we denote the face clockwisely next to the marked point i in Γ by fi, and denote its corresponding
face variable by Xi.

Let [ξ1, . . . , ξn] be the image of ˜χi (so ξ1, . . . , ξm are the standard basis vectors of Cm). Recall from Propo-
sition 2.31 that the source set of the special orientation on Γ is always [1, m]. We then make the following
observations.
(1) For Xj with m + 1 ≤ j ≤ n, any path in the special perfect orientation on Γ ending at k with

m + 1 ≤ k ≤ j always dominates the face fj, so ξk is in the form

ξk = Xj

where αj

ik is a polynomial in terms of face variables other than Xj. This implies that Xj is a scaling

kj is a polynomial in terms of face variables other than Xi. This implies that Xi is a scaling

(3) What about Xm? Note that no path in the special perfect orientation on Γ dominates this face.

Therefore changing Xm does not move the image of the boundary measurement map at all.

These observations show that changing boundary face variables of Γ does not move the image of ˜ψi across
diﬀerent ﬁbers of Conf n(Cm − {0}) → Conf n(Pm−1), which is precisely what we want to show.
(cid:3)
Now we are ﬁnally ready to prove the birational equivalence between Conf n(Pm−1) and Xi for any

boundary-removed quiver i.
Proposition 3.9. The rational maps ψi : Conf n(Pm−1) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Xi and χi : Xi (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Conf n(Pm−1) are birational
equivalences.
Proof. Recall that the involution ∗ : Conf n(Pm−1) → Conf n(Pm−1) is birationally equivalent to the following
composition of rational maps.

Conf n(Pm−1)

ψi

/ Xi

χi

/ Conf n(Pm−1)

r

/ Conf n(Pm−1)

where r : [l1, . . . , ln] (cid:55)→ [lm, . . . , l1, ln, . . . , lm+1]. Since Conf n(Pm−1) and Xi are irreducible algebraic varieties
of the same dimension, it follows that ψi is dominant (surjective onto a dense subset).
Conf n(Pm−1); on the other hand since

Now on the one hand, (∗ ◦ r ◦ χi) ◦ ψi

is obvsiouly birationally equivalent to the identity map on

ψi ◦ (∗ ◦ r ◦ χi) ◦ ψi

∼= ψi,

which is a dominant rational map, it follows that ψi ◦ (∗◦ r◦ χi) is also birationally equivalent to the identity
map on Xi. Thus we can conclude that both ψi and ∗◦ r ◦ χi are birational equivalences. But then obviously
∗ and r are both birational equivalences, and hence so is χi by itself.
(cid:3)
3.3. Positivity of the ∗. Since now we know that ψi : Conf n(Pm−1) (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Xi is a birational equivalence for
any minimal bipartite graph Γ, the map ∗ on Conf n(Pm−1) naturally induces a rational involution ∗ on each
seed X -torus Xi by the commutativity of the following diagram.

Conf n(Pm−1)

∗

Conf n(Pm−1)

ψi

Xi

ψi

/ Xi

∗

Since this induced map ∗ : Xi (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Xi is a rational map from a split algebraic torus back to itself, it makes
sense to ask whether this rational map is positive or not, and we will show in this subsection that the answer
is positive.

Note that we can break the induced map ∗ as the bottom row of the following commutative diagram.

X˜i

/ Xi

Then the problem of showing that the induced star map on Xi is positive reduced to showing that the
composition of the maps in the top row is positive. Note that the top row can be described as taking ratios
of minors of elements in the image of ˜χi. Thus it suﬃces to prove the following stronger result.

(cid:17)

where {γi} : Is → It denotes a family of pairwise disjoint paths going from Is to It. As a corollary, we see
is a polynomial with positive integral coeﬃcients in terms of the face variables Xf of Γ.

Proof. This proof is due to Postnikov [Pos06]. Let [ξ1, . . . , ξn] be a point in the image of ˜ψi. From Deﬁnition
2.32 we know that

∆I (ξ1, . . . , ξn) = det

i (Xf ) is actually a polynomial for any i ∈ [1, m] and any j ∈ [m + 1, n], and each term
Recall that ˜ψij
corresponds to a path in the canonical perfect orientation on Γ going from i to j. Therefore when we expand
the right hand side of the above equation, we will get a polynomial Φ(Xf ) in terms of the face variables of
Γ, to which a family of paths going from Is to It gives rise to a summand.

We claim that if the family of paths are not pairwise disjoint, then there is another summand in Φ(Xf ) to
cancel it out. Suppose γ and η are two intersecting paths in one such family (the picture looks as if they are
not intersecting but they in fact are sharing some edges together). Then we can just switch the beginning
parts of γ and η to obtain γ(cid:48) and η(cid:48) and keep everything else in the family unchanged; the resulting family
of paths will give another term in Φ(Xf ).

γ

γ(cid:48)

η

η(cid:48)

Note that the faces that are dominated for the two families of paths are the same; but since we switches
the sources of γ and η, the wedge products of ξi will diﬀer by a minus sign, and hence these two terms will
cancel out.

Thus the non-vanishing terms in Φ(Xf ) correspond to pairwise disjoint family of paths from Is to It.
Notice that a family of pairwise disjoint paths from Is to It must pair up the elements in the reverse order
with respect to the ordering on {1, . . . , n} inherited from Z, as implied by the Jordan curve theorem. Let
{γ1, . . . , γk} be one such pairwise disjoint family of curves from Is to It, where γl : sl → tl with s1 > ··· > sk
and t1 < ··· < tk. In order to restore the order in ∆[1,m] = det(ξ1 ∧ ··· ∧ ξm) = 1, we need to move ξsl back
to where they should be. Suppose we start from ξsk and work out way back to ξs1; then we ﬁnd that the
number of transposition we need to perform on the wedge product is exactly (m − sl) for each l, and this
cancels with the sign factor in front of the boundary measurement maps. In conclusion, the term in Φ(Xf )
that {γ1, . . . , γk} corresponds to is

(cid:3)
whose coeﬃcient is obviously both positive and integral. This ﬁnishes the proof.

(cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Xi0 can be expressed in the canonical coordinates as

∗∗(Xi,j) = X−1

n−m−i,m−j,

where the subscripts of Xi,j come from the quiver i0 associated to Γ0, as presented in Example 2.11.
Proof. Recall that the induced map ∗ : Xi0

(cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Xi0 decomposes as the bottom row of the following commu-

Since ψi0 is a birational equivalence, we can take [l1, . . . , ln] := ψ−1

(Xf ), which then gives
∗(Xf ) = ψi0 ◦ r ◦ χi0 (Xf ) = ψi0 ◦ r ◦ χi0 ◦ ψi0[l1, . . . , ln] = ψi0 ◦ ∗[l1, . . . , ln].

i0

To compute ∗[l1, . . . , ln], we need to lift everything to the conﬁguration space Conf n(Cm −{0}). Once for all
let’s ﬁx a section s of the ﬁber bundle map Conf n(Cm−{0}) → Conf n(Pm−1). Let [v1, . . . , vn] := s[l1, . . . , ln]
and let [η1, . . . , ηn] := ∗[v1, . . . , vn]. Then by the analysis above, we have

∗(Xf ) = ψi0 ◦ ∗[l1, . . . , ln] = qi0 ◦ ˜pi0 ◦ ˜ψi0 ◦ ∗[v1, . . . , vn] = qi0 ◦ ˜pi0 ◦ ˜ψi0 = qi0 ◦ ˜pi0 ◦ ˜ψi0 [η1, . . . , ηn].

So now the problem reduces to computing certain ratios of Pl¨ucker coordinates of [η1, . . . , ηn] := ∗[v1, . . . , vn].
By Equation (3.6) and the fact that [η1, . . . , ηn] := [ξm, . . . , ξ1, ξn, . . . , ξm+1] we derive the following equality
up to a sign, where (cid:63) is the Hodge star operator as deﬁned in Proposition 3.5:

ηi = (cid:63)

Depending on where (i, j) is in the quiver i0, we need to break the computation into ﬁve diﬀerent cases.
Combinatorially there are more cases to consider, but we can use the fact of ∗ being an involution to deduce
those cases from the following ﬁve:

What’s left in the proof is just a lengthy computation of each case. To save time, we will just do the last
The range of i and j for the third case is 2 ≤ i ≤ n− m− 2 and 2 ≤ j ≤ m− 2. Note that the dominating

To simplify notation, we will temporarily use an abuse of notation and denote

We also temporarily deﬁne

4. Cluster Donaldson-Thomas Transformation of Conf n(Pm−1)

Now let’s put the map ∗ aside and talk about the main subject of this paper, the Donaldson-Thomas
transformation of Conf n(Pm−1). So far we have obtain the following chain of commutative diagrams, in
which each map in the bottom row is a birational equivalence (recall that i0 is the quiver associated to the
minimal bipartite graph Γ0, which is described in Example 2.11).

(cid:3), which is in

fact a regular map and coincide with our description of the Donaldson-Thomas transformation DT in Theo-
rem 1.1; when we say that DT on Conf n(Pm−1) is the Donaldson-Thomas transformation of Conf n(Pm−1),
what we actually mean is that the bottom map ψ ◦ χ, which by an abuse of notation we also denote as DT,
is the Donaldson-Thomas transformation of the cluster Poisson variety X|i0|.
following two things for some seed X -torus Xi and the restriction of the induced map DT on it:

By Goncharov and Shen’s theorem (Theorem 2.24), in order to prove Theorem 1.1, it suﬃces to show the

X -isomorphisms;

(1) DT : Xi (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) Xi is a cluster X -transformation, i.e., a composition of cluster X -mutations and cluster
i maps positive basic X -laminations to negative basic X -laminations.
(2) its tropicalization DTt on X t
As it turns out, the easiest seed X -torus to work with is Xi0 , where i0 is the boundary-removed quiver as
described in Example 2.11.
Before we start the proof of Theorem 1.1, we need one more piece of construction which we call dual
minimal bipartite graph: given a minimal bipartite graph Γ, we deﬁne its dual minimal bipartite graph Γ∗
to be the one obtained by ﬂipping Γ over the diameter bisecting the (either) arc between m and m + 1. It
is not hard to verify that Γ∗ is also a minimal bipartite graph. By convention, we will denote the quiver
and its corresponding boundary-removed quiver associated to Γ∗ as ˜i∗ and i∗ respectively. Take the minimal

that the map ∗ on Conf n(Pm−1) is rationally equivalent to the composition r ◦ χ ◦ ψ, which implies that
χ is rationally equivalent to the composition r ◦ ∗ ◦ ψ−1 (note that r is an involution and ψ is a birational
equivalence). We can then form the following commutative diagram, where µ is a composition of cluster

which is exactly the same as the dominating set Ij,i for faces of Γ0 (c.f. Equation (3.12)). By a careful
comparison we see that r not only gives a correspondence of vertices of ˜i0 and ˜i∗
0 on the level of dominating
sets, but also this correspondence restricts to a quiver anti-isomorphism between i0 and i∗
0 (a quiver anti-
isomorphism τ is a bijection between the vertex sets such that the exchange matrices are related by ij =

in which we denote the coordinates on Xi∗

One can also verify from the quivers directly that (i, j) (cid:55)→ (n− m− j, m− i) deﬁnes a quiver isomorphism
0 and i0. Therefore we can conclude that σ is a cluster X -isomorphism and hence the composition

between i∗
DT = µ ◦ σ from Xi0 back to itself is a cluster X -transformation.
Lemma 4.2. The induced birational equivalence DT : Xi0

The right hand side tells us that DT∗(Xf ) can be computed as a quotient between Pl´’ucker coordinates
according to the combinatorial data given by the quiver ˜i0 and the dominating sets of its vertices.

Recall from Equation (3.12) that the dominating sets of the vertices of ˜i0 are

(cid:26) [1, m]

Ii,j =

[1, m − j] ∪ [m + i − j + 1, m + i]

if (j, i) = (0, 0);
if (i, j) (cid:54)= (0, 0).

Also recall from Proposition 3.10 that for a generic point [v1, . . . , vn] := s ◦ χi0(Xf ), its Pl´’ucker coordinate
∆Ii,j [v1, . . . , vn] is a polynomial obtained by summing up families of pairwise disjoint paths in the special
perfect orientation on Γ0 going from [1, m]− Ii,j to [m + 1, n]∩ Ii,j. From the identity above we can compute
the following.

 ∅
 ∅

[1, m] − Ii,j =

[m + 1, n] ∩ Ii,j =

[m − j + 1, m + i − j]
[m − j + 1, m]

[m + 1, m + i]
[m + i − j + 1, m + i]

if (i, j) = (0, 0);
if (i, j) (cid:54)= (0, 0) and i ≤ j;
if (i, j) (cid:54)= (0, 0) and i ≥ j.
if (i, j) = (0, 0);
if (i, j) (cid:54)= (0, 0) and i ≤ j;
if (i, j) (cid:54)= (0, 0) and i ≥ j.

One great feature of the minimal bipartite graph Γ0 is that its special perfect orientation is really special:

it forms a grid that only go to the right horizontally and down vertically (see Proposition 2.31).

Thus for any dominating set Ii,j, there is a unique such family of pairwise disjoint path that maximizes
the degree of all face variables, which consists of a collection of (cid:107)-shaped paths going from [1, m] − Ii,j to
[m + 1, n] ∩ Ii,j as follows.

[1, m] − Ii,j

[m + 1, n] ∩ Ii,j

Now we just need to ﬁnd out what is the degree of a given face variable Xk,l in DT∗(Xi,j), which is a
certain ratios of Pl¨ucker coordinates of s◦ χi0(Xf ). Depending on where (i, j) is in the quiver i0, we need to

case, which includes all techniques required to compute all other cases.

What’s left in the proof is just a lengthy computation of each case. To save time, we will just do the last
First we can pair up (i, i − 1) with (i + 1, i), (i − 1, i − 1) with (i + 1, i + 1), (i − 1, i) with (i, i + 1), based
on the diﬀerence of the two coordinates within each pair. Next we make the observation that in each pair,
the two families of (cid:107)-shaped paths only diﬀer by one or two. Let’s consider the pair (i, i− 1) and (i + 1, i) for
example. The family of (cid:107)-shaped paths in ∆Ii,i−1 goes from [m − i + 2, m] to [m + 2, m + i], and the family
of (cid:107)-shaped paths in ∆Ii+1,i goes from [m − i + 1, m] to [m + 2, m + i + 1]; since ∆Ii+1,i is in the numerator
and ∆Ii,i−1 is in the denominator, the overall contribution of this pair is a single (cid:107)-shaped path going from
m − i + 1 to m + i + 1 in the numerator.
Similarly, the overall contribution of the pair ((i − 1, i), (i, i + 1)) is a single (cid:107)-shaped path going from
m − i to m + i in the numerator, and the overall contribution of the pair ((i − 1, i − 1), (i + 1, i + 1)) is two
disjoint (cid:107)-shaped paths going from [m − i, m − i + 1] to [m + i, m + i + 1] in the denominator.
Now if we draw these four (cid:107)-shaped paths on Γ0 and remembering whether they belong to the numerator
or denominator, we see that the only non-zero degree face variable in this ratio is Xi,i, which is of degree
−1.
