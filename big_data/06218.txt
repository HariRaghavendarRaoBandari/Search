Solving the U(2)L×U(2)R symmetric Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions

A less well known variant of the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model with Nc colors and U(2)L×U(2)R
chiral symmetry is studied in 1+1 dimensions. Using semi-classical methods appropriate for the
large Nc limit, we determine the vacuum manifold, the meson spectrum, massless and massive multi-
fermion bound states and the phase diagram as a function of temperature, chemical potential and
isospin chemical potential. An important tool to understand soliton dynamics is the generalization
of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach to two ﬂavors along the lines recently developed by
Takahashi in the context of unconventional fermionic superﬂuids and superconductors.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The two best studied variants of the massless Gross-Neveu (GN) model [1] diﬀer by their chiral symmetry groups.

The ﬁrst model has the Lagrangian

L = ¯ψi∂/ψ +

g2
2

( ¯ψψ)2

(Z2-GN).

(1)

Throughout this paper, we are always in 1+1 dimensions and suppress contracted “color” labels on the fermion
bilinears (1...Nc). The Lagrangian (1) is invariant under independent sign ﬂips of left- and right-handed Dirac ﬁelds,
corresponding to the discrete chiral group Z2,L×Z2,R. The second model has a continuous U(1)L×U(1)R chiral
symmetry and is often referred to as two-dimensional Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL2) model [2],

L = ¯ψi∂/ψ +

g2

2 (cid:2)( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5ψ)2(cid:3)

(U(1)-NJL).

(2)

Here, phases of left- and right-handed fermion ﬁelds can be rotated independently. As a phenomenological model, the
NJL model in 3+1 dimensions is in general considered with Nc = 3, but two additional ﬂavors (Nf = 2) corresponding
to isospin in strong interaction physics [3]. This leads to the Lagrangian with SU(2)L×SU(2)R chiral symmetry

g2

L = ¯ψi∂/ψ +

2 (cid:2)( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5~τ ψ)2(cid:3)

(SU(2)-NJL).

(3)

The same theory in 1+1 dimensions is also exactly solvable in the large Nc limit, see the recent paper [4]. As shown
there and noticed before in the context of the phase diagram [5], the physics is closer to that of the GN model (1)
than to that of the NJL2 model (2). This reﬂects the following group-theoretical fact: The SU(2) chiral symmetry
also entails the discrete symmetry of the one-ﬂavor GN model through the center of the group SU(2), but obviously
not the full U(1) symmetry. If Lagrangian (3) is the generalization of Lagrangian (1) to two ﬂavors, it is not too hard
to identify the generalization of Lagrangian (2) to two ﬂavors: It is the NJL-type model with U(2)L×U(2)R chiral
symmetry and Lagrangian

g2

L = ¯ψi∂/ψ +

2 (cid:2)( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψ~τ ψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5ψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5~τ ψ)2(cid:3)

(U(2)-NJL).

(4)

This model has been considered in 3+1 dimensions before [6–8], but not yet in 1+1 dimensions, to the best of our
knowledge. We intend to ﬁll this gap here. When going through the four models (1)–(4), the complexity increases
signiﬁcantly, as evidenced by the number of (real) bilinear condensates which is doubled at each step (1 → 2 → 4 → 8).
Nevertheless, according to the experience with the one-ﬂavor models, the solution of the U(2)-NJL model is expected
to be simpler than that of the SU(2)-NJL model.

Model (4) is also interesting for another reason: Recently, Takahashi has generalized solutions of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes (BdG) equation to multicomponent form in the context of unconventional Fermi superﬂuids [9, 10]. This work

2

has been found useful for solving twisted kink dynamics in the SU(2) symmetric model [4]. It was noticed there that
the elementary kink of Takahashi, the simplest multi-fermion bound state, does not exist in the SU(2) model, since
it is not charge conjugation invariant. For the same reason the kink of Shei in the NJL2 model [11] does not appear
in isolation in the GN model, only as a constituent of kink-antikink bound states (Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu baryon
[12]). It is then plausible, and will indeed be conﬁrmed below, that Takahashi’s kink will appear in the model (4) as
a physical state.

The present paper deals mostly with Lagrangian (4), but cross references to the other variants of the GN model
will be frequent. It is therefore necessary to adopt a simple naming of the four distinct models. Since our emphasis
is on the chiral symmetry group, we will refer in the present work to the models (1) – (4) as Z2-GN, U(1)-NJL,
SU(2)-NJL and U(2)-NJL models, respectively, as already indicated in the equations. We also omit the subscript 2
for the number of dimensions from now on.

This paper is organized as follows. Sect. II develops the mean ﬁeld theory of the U(2)-NJL model, i.e., the Hartree-
Fock (HF) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approaches. In Sect. III, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking,
the dynamical fermion mass and the vacuum manifold are discussed. The meson spectrum is the topic of Sect. IV,
where the relativistic random phase approximation (RPA) is invoked to analyze small ﬂuctuations around the HF
vacuum. Massless hadrons, chiral spiral type condensates and the phase diagram as a function of (T, µ, µ3) are all
related to the chiral anomaly and the fact that baryon number has a topological interpretation, as discussed in Sect. V.
In Sect. VI we generalize our previous solution of the TDHF equations from the U(1)-NJL model to the two-ﬂavor
case, rederiving Takahashi’s recent work on the BdG equation in a slightly diﬀerent language. This has been done to
make sure that the formalism from condensed matter physics really applies to the relativistic quantum ﬁeld case at
hand, and to facilitate comparison with previous works on other variants of GN or NJL models [13–15]. A few simple
applications to soliton problems with one and two bound states are given in Sects. VII and VIII. We ﬁnish with a
short concluding section, Sect. IX.

RψRi depends only on z, the left-handed density ρL = hψ†

If we take the expectation value of these equations in an arbitrary state, we conclude that the right-handed density
ρR = hψ†
LψLi only on ¯z, i.e., they can only move with the
velocity of light to the right or to the left (or be constant). In a localized, massive state like a solitonic bound state or
breather, these densities must therefore vanish identically. The same argument goes through for the isovector currents
and densities, since

Hence we anticipate that all densities and current densities must be zero inside an arbitrary soliton or multi-soliton
state, a strong constraint on multi-fermion states following from chiral symmetry.

(10)

The basic equation in the large Nc limit is the relativistic version of the time dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)

equation. In the present case of Lagrangian (4), it reads

3

together with the self-consistency conditions

hiγµ∂µ − (S0 + ~S~τ ) − iγ5(P0 + ~P ~τ )i ψ = 0

S0 = −g2h ¯ψψi,
P0 = −g2h ¯ψiγ5ψi,

~S = −g2h ¯ψ~τ ψi,

~P = −g2h ¯ψiγ5~τ ψi.

We choose a chiral representation of the Dirac matrices (diagonal γ5)

The TDHF equation in Hamiltonian form then assumes the form

γ0 = σ1,

γ1 = iσ2,

γ5 = γ0γ1 = −σ3.

(14)

Here, the Hamiltonian has been written in 2×2-block-form, ψ1 = ψL and ψ2 = ψR are 2d isospinors, and ∆ is the
2×2 matrix

∆ = (S0 − iP0) + (~S − i ~P )~τ := ∆0 + ~∆~τ .

2i∂ψ1 = −∆†ψ2,

(15)

(16)

(17)

a 2-component generalization of the equations familiar from the one-ﬂavor case. Not only the Dirac-TDHF equation
(17), but also the self-consistency condition (16) are manifestly preserved under chiral transformations

ψ1 → ULψ1, ψ2 → URψ2, ∆ → UR∆U †
L,

UR,L ∈ U(2).

(18)

That is to say that two solutions which diﬀer only by a chiral transformation have to be considered as being physically
indistinguishable.

III. VACUUM AND DYNAMICAL FERMION MASS

If chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken but Lorentz invariance is preserved, the vacuum is characterized by a
space-time independent mean ﬁeld ∆vac. In order to decide whether this happens, we diagonalize the HF Hamiltonian
(a 4 × 4 matrix) with homogeneous ∆vac, Eq. (15), in momentum space,
k (cid:19) .

(20)

(21)

Next we minimize the vacuum energy density, following closely the corresponding steps in the Z2-GN model (see e.g.
[16]),

4

where Esp(m) is the single particle vacuum energy density of the Z2-GN model,

Evac = Esp(m1) + Esp(m2) + Edc,

whereas Edc denotes the double counting correction of the interaction energy density characteristic for the HF approach,

Minimizing Evac with respect to m1, m2 yields the two conditions

(i = 1, 2).

(24)

(25)

Not surprisingly, the minimum is at m1 = m2 := m, and we recover the gap equation of the Z2-GN model with 2Nc
ﬂavors. The renormalized vacuum energy density is accordingly

Evac = −Nc

What is the vacuum manifold? The condition m1 = m2 implies Z = 0, Eq. (21), or

The dynamical mass then becomes

The vacuum potential matrix ∆vac [see (15)] is given by

∆vac =

and satisﬁes

Choosing units where m = 1, we ﬁrst divide ∆vac by √m2 from Eq. (28) to get the U(2) matrix

where the ﬁrst factor belongs to U(1), the second to SU(2). The condition m = 1 implies furthermore that

∆vac =

(30)

(31)

(32)

Since a U(2) matrix has 4 real parameters, but ∆ in (31) is parametrized by 5 real numbers (S0, P0, ~P ), one condition
is indeed necessary. Alternatively, it is obvious that expression (31) depends only on the 4 parameters P0/S0, ~P /S0.
Thus the vacuum manifold is U(2) or S1 × S3. In cases where only a single vacuum is involved, the simplest choice
is ∆vac = 1, which can always be achieved by a chiral transformation. For twisted ﬁeld conﬁgurations, we shall use
∆vac = 1 for x → −∞, but we then need the general expression (31) for x → ∞.

IV. MESON SPECTRUM

5

In order to derive the spectrum of fermion-antifermion bound states (mesons), one has to go beyond the HF ap-
proximation and consider small ﬂuctuations around the HF vacuum. The appropriate tool is the relativistic RPA.
Although the technicalities are fairly involved, we can be brief here since one can follow almost literally the corre-
sponding caculation in the Z2-GN model, described in more detail in Refs. [16, 17]. One starts from the equation of
motion for the color singlet bilinear operator

Qαβ(x, y) =

1
Nc

Nc

Xi=1

ψ†

i,β(y)ψi,α(x).

(33)

In the present case, α, β are combined Dirac- and isospin indices ranging from 1 to 4. The 4 × 4 matrix operator
Q(x, y) satisﬁes the equation of motion

i∂tQ(x, y) = −i {∂yQ(x, y)γ5 + γ5∂xQ(x, y)}

4

− Ncg2

Xn=1

{Tr [OnQ(x, x)] OnQ(x, y) − Q(x, y)OnTr [OnQ(y, y)]}

where

O1 = γ0, O2 = iγ1, O3 = γ0~τ , O4 = iγ1~τ .

(34)

(35)

We have dropped terms irrelevant in the large Nc limit. In the case of isovector operators O3, O4, scalar products are
implied in Eq. (34). In the Z2-GN model, only the O1-term was present. The next steps will not be shown in detail,
but only enumerated:

1. Expand the bilinear operator around the vacuum expectation value

Q(x, y) = ρ(x − y) +

1
√Nc

˜Q(x, y).

(36)

2. Linearize the equation of motion in the ﬂuctuation part ˜Q(x, y).

3. Choose the vacuum ∆vac = 1 without loss of generality.
4. Transform ˜Q and ρ to momentum space.

5. Expand ˜Q into vacuum spinors u, v. In the large Nc limit, only particle-hole components are important,

(37)
This expansion is related to the Dirac indices only, so that ˜Q12, ˜Q21 are still 2×2 matrices consisting of isoscalar
and isovector pieces,

˜Q(k′, k) = u(k′)v†(k) ˜Q12(k′, k) + v(k′)u†(k) ˜Q21(k′, k).

˜Qij = ˜Q(0)

ij + τa ˜Q(a)

ij

(ij = 12, 21).

6. Sandwich the equation of motion between the vacuum and one-meson states with momentum P ,

hP| ˜Q21(k′, k)|vaci = 2πδ(P − k + k′)X(P, k),
hP| ˜Q12(k′, k)|vaci = 2πδ(P − k + k′)Y (P, k).

(38)

(39)

The RPA-amplitudes X, Y then satisfy coupled linear integral equations of the standard RPA form. What one ﬁnds is
that the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons decouple, as do the 4 diﬀerent isospin components (isoscalar and isovector).
The kernel of the integral equations is 1-term separable, so that there can be at most one meson bound state per
channel. Owing to the separability one can easily obtain an eigenvalue condition from the RPA equations. All 4 scalar
mesons satisfy the same equation leading to the eigenvalue condition

identical to the one of the Z2-GN model with 2Nc ﬂavors. We use the notation

6

(41)

E(k) =pk2 + m2, E(k − P, k) = E(k − P ) + E(k),

and E(P ) = √M2 + P 2 is the meson energy. For meson mass M = 2m, the factor in curly brackets in Eq. (40)
becomes 1 and the whole equation reduces to the vacuum gap equation, hence the 4 scalar mesons all have the
same mass M = 2m. The 4 pseudoscalar mesons also satisfy identical equations, leading to the diﬀerent eigenvalue
condition

from which we can read oﬀ a vanishing meson mass M = 0. These are the would-be Goldstone bosons, reﬂecting
the 4 ﬂat directions (i.e., the dimension of the vacuum manifold). Note that covariance is manifest in the rela-
tivistic RPA. Since the meson spectrum has not been discussed in Ref. [4], let us mention that a corresponding
calculation for the SU(2)-NJL model would have yielded one massive scalar/isoscalar (M = 2m) and three massless
pseudoscalar/isovector mesons.

V. MASSLESS HADRONS, CHIRAL SPIRAL, PHASE DIAGRAM

For the present purpose, it is suﬃcient to consider the case where the internal rotation axis is “frozen”, say in the

3-direction,

∆ = ∆0 + ∆3τ3.

(43)

Then the two isospin channels decouple, each one corresponding to a U(1)-NJL model with Nc ﬂavors and mean ﬁeld

S − iP = ∆0 ± ∆3 = (S0 ± S3) − i(P0 ± P3).

(44)

In the same way as Z2-GN solutions are particular solutions of the SU(2)-NJL model [4], we thus ﬁnd that U(1)-NJL
solutions are particular solutions of the U(2)-NJL model. The TDHF equations are evidently satisﬁed, as are the
self-consistency conditions. The vacuum can be chosen as ∆vac = 1. To describe dense matter, we combine two
U(1)-chiral spirals [18, 19] in the two isospin channels to the following transformation of the vacuum spinors

The two resulting chiral spirals have same radius (m = 1) but diﬀerent pitches,

In the low density limit we ﬁnd massless, delocalized baryons with diﬀerent isospin content.

Without detailed calculation, we can predict the phase diagram in (µ, µ3, T ) space by using the known results for
the U(1)-NJL and SU(2)-NJL models [4, 16, 19]. For temperatures above Tc = eC/π, chiral symmetry is restored
(∆ = 0) and the fermions are massless for all (µ, µ3). Below Tc the order parameter is expected to be

In the SU(2)-NJL2 model, we had a spatial modulation of the radius of the chiral spiral. Here the radius is spatially
constant, but the pitch gets modulated. Notice the lack of periodicity of ∆ if µ and µ3 are incommensurate. Thus
the phase diagram is extremely simple and closely reminiscent of the U(1)-NJL model, see Fig. 1, in contrast to the
more complicated phase diagram of the Z2-GN and SU(2)-NJL models [4, 5, 20].

It is worth noting that the type of order parameter (48) has appeared before in the literature as variational ansatz
for the SU(2)-NJL model in 3+1 dimensions [21]. In our case, the fact that the chiral group is U(2) rather than SU(2)
is crucial for this simple ansatz to work quantitatively, see also Ref. [4] for a comparison with the phase diagram of
the SU(2)-NJL model in 1+1 dimensions.

VI. SOLITON DYNAMICS: MULTICOMPONENT TDHF EQUATION

A framework which enables us to solve soliton dynamics in the U(2)-NJL model is available from the theory of
fermionic superﬂuidity and superconductivity in the form of a general solution of the multicomponent BdG equation [9].
In a previous work, we have outlined how to adapt this formalism to the SU(2)-NJL model [4]. Since it is inconvenient
to mix two formalisms with diﬀerent conventions, and since details of the symmetries of ∆ and occupation fractions
may be somewhat diﬀerent in condensed matter and particle physics, we proceed in this section to generalize the
one-ﬂavor formalism of Refs. [13–15] to two ﬂavors. We are strongly guided by Takahashi’s work and will arrive at
results equivalent to his results, but in such a way that the equations resemble the previous ones from the one-ﬂavor
case and where covariance is more manifest. We hope that this will make applications to relativistic quantum ﬁeld
theories easier.

After inspecting Takahashi’s formalism, one quickly discovers that the generalization of the framework of Refs. [13–
15] is rather straightforward. Due to the additional ﬂavor index, the notation becomes more cumbersome, otherwise
the whole scheme remains practically unchanged. This is true notably for the construction of transparent potentials
where we follow closely the logic of Ref. [14].

In [14], the starting point for attacking N soliton problems was a N -dimensional vector e with components

The ζn are complex numbers (Im ζn > 0) characterizing the pole positions of the TDHF continuum wave functions
in the complex ζ plane, ζ being the spectral parameter related to light cone momentum and energy (uniformizing

so that en is recognized as a plane wave evaluated at a complex spectral parameter corresponding to a bound state
pole. The main generalization when going from one to two ﬂavors consists in introducing two copies of each en,

en → en~pn,

en,α = enpn,α.

(54)

Here, ~pn is a 2-component, constant, complex vector with components pn,α.
Its precise meaning will be clariﬁed
later on when we investigate few-soliton problems in more detail. The generalization to more than 2 ﬂavors is
straightforward, but not needed here. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the vectors ~pn are normalized
(~p †
n ~pn = 1). We shall use Greek indices and the summation convention for ﬂavor (α = 1...2) and suppress the indices
n = 1...N referring to the bound state poles whenever possible. Then we have to modify the equations of Refs. [14, 15]
as follows: Continuum TDHF spinors are now 4-component objects represented as

The following ansatz is inspired by the assumed pole structure of the continuum spinors (N poles, corresponding to
N bound states)

When summing over all continuum states, they should be chosen as (q1, q2) = (1, 0) and (0, 1) to account for incoming
waves in the two isospin channels (at least, if the vacuum at x → −∞ is chosen as ∆− = 1). The ϕi,n,α are closely

As in Refs. [14, 15], we suppress soliton indices (n, m) to ease the notation. The ϕ1,n,α, ϕ2,n,α satisfy the following
system of linear, algebraic equations

(ω + B)ϕ1,α = eα,
(ω + B)ϕ2,α = −fα,

(59)

where fn,α = en,α/ζ ∗
n. A constant, Hermitean N × N matrix ω encoding further information about the soliton
conﬁguration (geometry, initial conditions, details about time dependence for breathers) has been introduced. The
dimension of the linear systems does not increase with the number of ﬂavors, but depends only on the total number
of bound state poles. What is new is the factor ~p †
m~pn in Bnm and the fact that one needs to solve the linear equation
for each ﬂavor component α in turn, a rather mild complication. Notice that the pairs of exponentials (en,α,−fn,α)
provide us with 2N non-normalizable solutions of the free, massive Dirac equation (m = 1),

2i∂eα = fα,

Remarkably, the self-consistency condition is not aﬀected at all when going from one to two ﬂavors.

As outlined in Sect. II, due to current conservation, the solitons described by this formalism should have identically
vanishing baryon density (ρ = hψ†ψi) and isospin densities (ρa = hψ†τaψi). This should hold for left- and right-
handed fermions separately, or, equivalently, for charge and current densities. It is a good test of the formalism to
prove this in all generality. Deﬁne

(81)

Introducing τ 0 = 1 in addition to the ordinary SU(2) generators ~τ , we can treat the baryon density and isovector
densities on the same footing. The densities comprise a part from the Dirac sea and a part from the bound states.
The sea part has to be subtracted by the vacuum contribution for the case a = 0 only (baryon density). The sea
contribution is evaluated as follows. We take into account the measure (ζ2 + 1)/2ζ2 and write the total density as

VII. ONE POLE – THE FUNDAMENTAL TWISTED KINK

Choose N = 1 (one soliton) in the general formalism and work it out. After setting

we ﬁnd the mean ﬁeld

V1 = i

1 )

∆ = 1 +(cid:18) ζ1

1 − 1(cid:19) V1

ζ ∗

1 + V1

~p1~p †
1 .

This is the most elementary type of kink interpolating between two vacua. In the rest frame,

ζ1 = −e−iφ1,
For x → −∞, ∆ = ∆− = 1. For x → ∞, ∆ = ∆+ with

V1 = e2x sin φ1 .

∆+ = 1 +(cid:0)e−2iφ1 − 1(cid:1) ~p1~p †

1 .

By a unitary transformation we can map ~p1 onto the vector (1, 0)T , in which case we recover the standard U(1)-NJL
kink in the isospin-up channel and the vacuum ∆+ in the diagonal form

∆+ =(cid:18) e−2iφ1 0
1(cid:19) .

0

(99)

Hence we have a twisted kink in the isospin up channel and the vacuum for isospin down. The general expression
(98) is nothing but the spectral representation of the unitary matrix ∆+. Denoting the (normalized) eigenvectors
corresponding to the eigenvalues e−2iφ1 and 1 by ~p1 and ~p2, respectively, we have

Eliminating the second term with the help of the completeness relation

∆+ = e−2iφ1 ~p1~p †

1 + ~p2~p †
2 .

~p1~p †

1 + ~p2~p †

2 = 1

(100)

(101)

then reproduces (98). This shows that the vector ~p1 can be interpreted as follows: ~p1 is the eigenvector of the unitary
matrix ∆+, the vacuum at x → ∞, belonging to the “twisted” eigenvalue e−2iφ1 . With one bound state, only one
eigenvalue can be twisted. This is the fundamental twisted kink.
Since we can reduce the simplest kink problem to the kink of the U(1)-NJL model, the spinors, self-consistency and

vanishing baryon and isospin density follow from one-ﬂavor results and need not be repeated here.

13

This is exactly the kink of Takahashi [9]. It is special in the following sense: A generic twisted kink in the U(2)-NJL
model should connect the vacuum ∆− = 1 with the vacuum ∆+, a unitary matrix with eigenvalues e−2iφ1 , e−2iφ2.
In the present framework this requires a bound state of two elementary kinks, see next section. This was already
used in a previous work on the SU(2)-NJL model [4], where the eigenvalues have to be complex conjugates e∓2iφ1. It
is then necessary to bind a kink with its charge conjugate. No such restriction exists in the U(2)-NJL model. The
elementary kink exists as a physical state in the U(2)-NJL model, whereas it is conﬁned in the SU(2)-NJL model.
This is completely analoguous to what happens with Shei’s twisted kink [11] in the U(1)-NJL and Z2-GN models,
respectively [15].

VIII. TWO POLES – SCATTERING OF FUNDAMENTAL KINKS, GENERIC KINK AND BREATHER

We start with the scattering of two elementary kinks of the type discussed in the preceding section. This requires

a diagonal matrix ω. We set

ω11 = ω22 = 1, V1 = i

|e1|2
(ζ1 − ζ ∗
1 )

,

ξV2 = i

|e2|2
(ζ2 − ζ ∗
2 )

(102)

where ξ will be interpreted below. Then the result of using the general formalism for two poles (N = 2) follows the
same pattern as kink-kink scattering in the U(1)-NJL model or SU(2)-NJL model. The mean ﬁeld can be cast into
the form

∆ =

1 + U1V1 + U2ξV2 + U12V1V2

1 + V1 + ξV2 + V1V2

.

(103)

The interpretation of the U(2) matrices U1, U2, U12 and of the factor ξ follows upon considering the asymptotics of
the scattering process,

∆1,in = lim
V2→0

∆ =

∆2,in = lim
V1→∞

∆ =

∆1,out = lim
V2→∞

∆ =

(104)

Thus ξ accounts for the time delay of the solitons during the collision, and we have made explicit the intrinsic form
of the soliton by pulling out the factors U1 (for ∆2,in) and U2 (for ∆1,out) to the right. One recognizes U1, U2, U12U †
1
and U12U †

2 as the intrinsic twist factors of the participating solitons. The formalism yields the following results

In this formulation, the normalized vectors ~p1, ~p2 are input and specify the twist of incoming kink 1 and outgoing
kink 2. The normalized vectors ~q1, ~q2 of the twist of outgoing kink 1 and incoming kink 2 can be expressed in terms
of ~p1, ~p2 and the pole positions ζi as follows,

~q1 = N1 [σ21ζ ∗
~q2 = N2 [σ12ζ ∗

1 (ζ2 − ζ ∗
2 (ζ1 − ζ ∗

2 )~p2 − ζ ∗
1 )~p1 − ζ ∗

2 (ζ2 − ζ ∗
1 (ζ1 − ζ ∗

1 )~p1] ,
2 )~p2] .

(106)

We have used the notation

σ12 = ~p †

1 ~p2,

σ21 = ~p †

2 ~p1 = σ∗

12.

The normalization factors ensuring that ~q †

1 ~q1 = ~q †

N1 =

N2 =

√ξ

,

.

Here, ξ is the time delay factor also appearing in Eqs. (103,104) for which we ﬁnd

ξ−1 = 1 −

(ζ1 − ζ ∗
(ζ1 − ζ ∗

1 )(ζ2 − ζ ∗
2 )
2 )(ζ2 − ζ ∗
1 )

σ12σ21.

14

(107)

(108)

(109)

Let us consider some interesting limiting cases. Obviously, the modulus of σ12 controls the strength of the kink-kink
interaction between the two kinks. If ~p1, ~p2 are parallel, |σ12| = 1 and everything can be rotated into the isospin up
channel where we recover scattering of two standard kinks of the U(1)-NJL model, with the known time delay factor

2

.

(110)

ξ =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

ζ1 − ζ ∗

ζ1 − ζ2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

If ~p1, ~p2 are orthogonal, σ12 = 0 and the two kinks live in the two isospin channels without any interaction (ξ = 1). By
varying the angle spanned by ~p1 and ~p2, we can thus vary the strength of the interaction between these two extreme
cases.

A special case of the kink-kink scattering problem is the bound state. This may be viewed as the generic U(2)-
twisted kink, since it enables us to connect an arbitrary vacuum ∆+ at x → ∞ to ∆− = 1 at x → −∞. In the rest
frame of such a composite kink, we have to choose

Some simpliﬁcations occur,

ζ1 = −e−2iφ1,

ζ2 = −e−2iφ2

~q1 = N1h(cid:16)ei(φ1+φ2) − 1(cid:17) ~p1 − 2iσ21eiφ1 sin φ2~p2i

ξ−1 = 1 − σ12σ21

2 = 2 (1 − cos(φ1 + φ2) − 2σ12σ21 sin φ1 sin φ2)

2 sin φ1 sin φ2
1 − cos(φ1 + φ2)

(111)

(112)

In the one ﬂavor case, it was not possible to construct a bound state of two kinks with the same twist, φ1 = φ2. If
one specializes the formalism to this case, one recovers a single kink. In the two ﬂavor case, this restriction does not
exist anymore and we can construct a non-trivial bound state out of two constituents with the same twist. In this
case, Eq. (112) reduces to

~q1 = N1(cid:0)e2iφ1 − 1(cid:1) (~p1 − σ21~p2)
~q2 = −N2(cid:0)e2iφ1 − 1(cid:1) (σ12~p1 − ~p2)
N −2
2 = 4 sin2 φ1 (1 − σ12σ21)
1 = N −2
ξ−1 = 1 − σ12σ21

(113)

Finally, we turn to the twisted breather. A breather at rest can be generated by choosing η1 = η2 = 1 and a non-
diagonal matrix ω. The twisted breather is even more complicated here than in the single ﬂavor case, so we refrain
from discussing all possible parameter choices and illustrate the reult for a few simple special cases only. We choose
the same matrix ω than for one ﬂavor [15],

ω =

If we choose ~p1 and ~p2 to be parallel (θ2 = 0), we ﬁnd that

Here, the diagonal components ∆11, ∆22 are static, whereas the oﬀ-diagonal components ∆12, ∆21 oscillate with the
same frequency as the one-ﬂavor breather,

For any other choice of the angle θ2, all components of ∆ start to oscillate with the same frequency but diﬀerent
phases. The corresponding more complicated expressions for ∆ can easily be generated using the general framework,
but will not be given here.

IX. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have studied a variant of the integrable Gross-Neveu model family which has not yet received any
attention so far in 1+1 dimensions: The U(2)-NJL model with U(2)L×U(2)R chiral symmetry. Phenomenologically,

in 3+1 dimensions, the SU(2)L×SU(2)R model is more relevant. However, from a theoretical point of view, it is
quite instructive to include the U(2) model as well. After developing the mean ﬁeld approach and setting up the
TDHF equation for the U(2)-NJL model, we have studied the vacuum and identiﬁed the vacuum manifold as U(2).
Small ﬂuctuations in the 4 ﬂat directions give rise to 4 massless pseudoscalar mesons, whereas the other 4 directions
yield massive scalars right at threshold (M = 2m). The chiral spiral construction is especially simple here, as it can
be invoked both for baryonic and isospin charge. The phase diagram is extremely simple, generalizing the known
U(1)-NJL phase diagram to the (T, µ, µ3) space. Perhaps the most interesting topic is that of soliton dynamics.
Here it turns out that a recently developed solution of the matrix BdG system in condensed matter physics ﬁts
perfectly the U(1)-NJL model. We have rederived Takahashi’s results in the language of our previous work on the
U(1)-NJL model, and conﬁrmed that the fundamental kink is a physical state in the U(2) model while appearing only
as a conﬁned constituent in the SU(2) model. This is another striking example for the close relationship between
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory toy models and sophisticated, realistic condensed matter problems. In the present
work together with Ref. [4], we have generalized the well-known Z2-GN and U(1)-NJL models with Abelian chiral
groups to two ﬂavors and non-Abelian chiral groups SU(2) and U(2). A further generalization to the groups SU(N )
and U(N ) is straightforward, thereby extending the spectrum of integrable quantum ﬁeld theories substantially.
