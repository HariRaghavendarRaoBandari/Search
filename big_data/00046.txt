Abstract: The chirally rotated Schr¨odinger functional (χSF) with massless Wilson-type
fermions provides an alternative lattice regularization of the Schr¨odinger functional (SF),
with diﬀerent lattice symmetries and a common continuum limit expected from universality.
The explicit breaking of ﬂavour and parity symmetries needs to be repaired by tuning the
bare fermion mass and the coeﬃcient of a dimension 3 boundary counterterm. Once this is
achieved one expects the mechanism of automatic O(a) improvement to be operational in
the χSF, in contrast to the standard formulation of the SF. This is expected to signiﬁcantly
improve the attainable precision for step-scaling functions of some composite operators.
Furthermore, the χSF oﬀers new strategies to determine ﬁnite renormalization constants
which are traditionally obtained from chiral Ward identities.
In this paper we consider
a complete set of fermion bilinear operators, deﬁne corresponding correlation functions
and explain the relation to their standard SF counterparts. We discuss renormalization
and O(a) improvement and then use this set-up to formulate the theoretical expectations
which follow from universality. Expanding the correlation functions to one-loop order of
perturbation theory we then perform a number of non-trivial checks. In the process we
obtain the action counterterm coeﬃcients to one-loop order and reproduce some known
perturbative results for renormalization constants of fermion bilinears. By conﬁrming the
theoretical expectations, this perturbative study lends further support to the soundness of
the χSF framework and prepares the ground for non-perturbative applications.

Introduction

The chirally rotated Schr¨odinger functional (χSF) [1, 2] provides a new tool to address
renormalization and O(a) improvement problems in lattice QCD and similar lattice gauge
theories with Wilson type fermions. With an even number of massless fermion ﬂavours
it is formally related to the standard Schr¨odinger functional (SF) [3–5] by a non-singlet
chiral ﬁeld rotation. Such chirally rotated SF boundary conditions have ﬁrst appeared
with staggered fermions [6] where the chiral rotation can be absorbed in the reconstruc-
tion of four-spinors from the one-component staggered fermion ﬁeld [7, 8]. Similarly, with
Ginsparg-Wilson or domain-wall fermions such boundary conditions [9, 10] can be re-
interpreted as standard SF boundary conditions, based on exact Ginsparg-Wilson-type
lattice symmetries [11]. With Wilson fermions the chiral ﬁeld rotation does not correspond
to a lattice symmetry, and the χSF can thus be seen as an alternative lattice regularization
of the SF. The χSF has practical advantages when applied to non-perturbative renormaliza-
tion problems. In particular, the expected property of automatic O(a) improvement [2, 12]
will potentially be very helpful in reducing systematic errors in continuum extrapolations
of step-scaling functions. The theoretical framework for the χSF has been deﬁned in ref. [2]
where also some perturbative tests have been performed at tree-level. Here we would like
to deﬁne the framework for systematic tests and applications of the χSF. In particular we
deﬁne boundary-to-boundary correlation functions, as well as boundary-to-bulk correlation
functions for a complete set of non-singlet fermion bilinear operators. We then establish a
dictionary translating them to their SF counterparts. This is reminiscent of twisted mass
QCD [13], except that we will here exclusively focus on the massless theory. From univer-
sality one then expects that the same dictionary holds in terms of renormalized correlation
functions up to cutoﬀ eﬀects. We formulate various consequences of this expectation such as
ﬂavour and parity symmetry restoration, the possibility to determine ﬁnite renormalization
constants (otherwise obtainable by chiral Ward identities), and scale dependent renormal-
ization constants in SF schemes, together with their step-scaling functions. We then use
one-loop perturbation theory to perform non-trivial tests of these expectations. Some ele-
ments of the set-up together with tests in quenched QCD have already appeared in ref. [14],

– 1 –

and preliminary one-loop results for the SF coupling have been given in refs. [15, 16]. For
related non-perturbative applications of the χSF to quenched lattice QCD cf. refs. [17, 18].
Preliminary results for two-ﬂavour lattice QCD can be found in ref. [19].

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we use a continuum language to discuss
the connection between the SF and the χSF and the respective correlation functions of
interest. The transcription to the lattice regularization is described in Section 3, followed
by a discussion of renormalization and Symanzik O(a) improvement, for both the standard
SF and the χSF. In Section 4 we summarize the theoretical expectations for the χSF.
The remainder of this paper discusses the perturbative expansion and one-loop results
for the action parameters (Section 5) and various ways to test and apply the theoretical
expectations in perturbation theory (Sects. 6 and 7). Section 8 contains a discussion of a
gluonic observable, the SF coupling, to one-loop order. Conclusions are drawn in Section 9,
and 3 appendices collect some deﬁnitions regarding fermion bilinear ﬁelds (Appendix A), a
few details on the calculation of the fermionic contribution to the SF coupling at one-loop
order (Appendix B) and a comparison at weak coupling between perturbation theory and
Monte-Carlo simulations (Appendix C).

2 Correlation functions and universality relations

In this section we recall the χSF boundary conditions and deﬁne the set of correlation
functions needed for our study. We shall use a continuum notation and defer the translation
to the lattice to Section 3.

2.1 Chiral rotations and correlation functions

The continuum action for Nf massless fermions in an external gauge ﬁeld1 Aµ(x),

Sf =Z d4x ψ(x)γµDµψ(x),

Dµ = ∂µ + Aµ,

(2.1)

has exact ﬂavour and chiral symmetries. The latter are broken if one imposes the standard
SF boundary conditions on the fermionic ﬁelds,

P+ψ(x)|x0=0 = 0,
ψ(x)P−|x0=0 = 0,

P−ψ(x)|x0=T = 0,
ψ(x)P+|x0=T = 0,

(2.2)

with the projectors P± = 1
transformation,

2 (1± γ0). Indeed, assuming Nf = 2 ﬂavours, a chiral non-singlet

ψ → R(α)ψ,

ψ → ψR(α),

R(α) = exp(iαγ5τ 3/2),

(2.3)

1With fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group SU(N ) we have Aµ = Aa

µT a, where
T a are the anti-hermitian generators in the fundamental representation, a sum over a = 1, . . . , N 2 − 1 is
implied, and we normalize the generators by tr(T aT b) = − 1
2 δab. Generalizations to other representations
are straightforward and do not aﬀect the discussion of chiral and ﬂavour symmetries.

– 2 –

with α = π/2 transforms Eqs. (2.2) to

˜Q+ψ(x)|x0=0 = 0,
ψ(x) ˜Q+|x0=0 = 0,

˜Q−ψ(x)|x0=T = 0,
ψ(x) ˜Q−|x0=T = 0 ,

where

˜Q± = 1

2 (1 ± iγ0γ5τ 3),

(2.4)

(2.5)

and the Pauli matrix τ 3 acts on the ﬂavour indices. If the ﬁeld transformation is performed
as a change of variables in the functional integral one obtains relations between standard
SF and χSF correlation functions,

(cid:10)O[ψ, ψ](cid:11)( ˜Q+) =(cid:10)O[R(−π/2)ψ, ψR(−π/2)](cid:11)(P+) ,
(cid:10)O[ψ, ψ](cid:11)(P+) =(cid:10)O[R(π/2)ψ, ψR(π/2)](cid:11)( ˜Q+) .

(2.6)

(2.7)

Here, the subscript indicates the projector deﬁning the Dirichlet component of the fermion
ﬁeld at x0 = 0. Note that the boundary fermion ﬁelds are included in this transformation
by the identiﬁcation,

ζ(x) = ψ(0+, x),
ζ ′(x) = ψ(T−, x),

¯ζ(x) = ψ(0+, x),
¯ζ ′(x) = ψ(T−, x).

(2.8)

(2.9)

The arguments 0+ or T− indicate that the ﬁelds are located in the bulk, inﬁnitesimally
away from the boundaries at x0 = 0, T . For later convenience we have not included the
projectors P± or ˜Q±, in contrast to conventions used in the literature [2, 20]. Instead we
include these projectors explicitly when deﬁning the bilinear boundary source ﬁelds.

2.2 Flavour structure and symmetries

While the standard SF can be formulated for any number of ﬂavours, this is not straight-
forward for the χSF [2]. We will restrict attention to gauge theories with an even number
of fermion ﬂavours. So far we have assumed Nf = 2, i.e. a doublet structure,

ψd! ,
ψ = ψu

(2.10)

with up and down type ﬂavours. For the correlation functions deﬁned below it will be
convenient to introduce more than a single up or down type ﬂavour, such that ﬂavour non-
singlet fermion bilinear ﬁelds can be formed with only up- or only down-type fermions.
We are thus led to consider the case Nf = 4 which we obtain by replicating the doublet
structure,

,

(2.11)

ψ =

ψu
ψd
ψu′
ψd′



– 3 –

i.e. there are two up and two down type ﬂavours. Obviously this implies that the ﬂavour
matrix τ 3 in Eqs. (2.3),(2.5) should be replaced by

τ 3 → 1l2 ⊗ τ 3 = diag(1,−1, 1,−1).

(2.12)

It is often convenient to reduce the ﬂavour structure of the projectors,

˜Q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Nf =2

with

= diag(Q+, Q−),

= diag(Q+, Q−, Q+, Q−),

(2.13)

˜Q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Nf =4

(2.14)

Q± = 1

2 (1 ± iγ0γ5).

Although the χSF boundary conditions diﬀer for up and down type ﬂavours, this does
not mean that the SU(Nf ) ﬂavour symmetry is broken. In fact, as discussed in ref. [2],
the distinction between ﬂavour and chiral symmetries in the absence of mass terms is
conventional. We here follow the convention used in ref. [2] and deﬁne the ﬂavour symmetry
such that the corresponding ﬁeld transformations take their usual form in the standard SF
In this basis, a ﬂavour transformation for Nf = 2 ﬂavours with parameters ωa
basis.
(a = 1, 2, 3), looks as usual,

ψ → exp i

ωaτ a! ψ,

3Xa=1

ψ → ψ exp −i

ωaτ a! .

3Xa=1

(2.15)

As the SF and χSF ﬁelds are related by the chiral rotation (2.3) the same ﬂavour symmetry
transformation on the χSF ﬁelds takes the form

ωaτ a! R(α)ψ,
ψ → R(−α) exp i
3Xa=1
ωaτ a! R(−α).
ψ → ψ R(α) exp −i
3Xa=1

(2.16)

(2.17)

In particular, in the continuum the χSF shares all the symmetries with the standard SF,
i.e. the full ﬂavour symmetry, charge conjugation, spatial rotations and parity. Of particular
interest is the parity symmetry, which in the SF basis is realized by

P :(ψ(x) → γ0ψ(˜x),

ψ(x) → ψ(˜x)γ0,

˜x = (x0,−x),

(2.18)

whereas its covariantly rotated χSF version reads, for α = π/2,

P5 :(ψ(x) → iγ0γ5τ 3ψ(˜x),
ψ(x) → −ψ(˜x)iγ0γ5τ 3,

˜x = (x0,−x).

(2.19)

The P5-symmetry plays an important rˆole in the following, as it may be used to classify
lattice correlation functions and their approach to the continuum limit. More precisely,
in the lattice regularized χSF the P5-even correlation functions are automatically O(a)

– 4 –

improved in the bulk, whereas their P5-odd counterparts are pure lattice artefacts. Hence,
P5 may be taken as a substitute for the γ5τ 1 symmetry used in ref. [2],

ψ → γ5τ 1ψ,

ψ → −ψγ5τ 1,

(2.20)

which corresponds to a discrete ﬂavour symmetry. The advantage of P5 is that it is ﬂavour
diagonal and therefore more suitable for χSF correlation functions with speciﬁc ﬂavour
assignments.

2.3 SF correlation functions

The SF correlation functions required for this work have previously appeared in the liter-
ature, e.g. in refs. [20, 21]. When written in terms of ﬁxed ﬂavours, f1, f2 ∈ {u, d, u′, d′},
with f1 6= f2, they take the form

In the literature, the composite ﬁelds X and Yk stand for the fermion bilinears2 X = A0, P

and Yk = Ak, Vk, Tk0. Here we also include X = V0, S and Yk = Ak,eTk0. While these

additional correlation functions are odd under parity (2.18) and thus vanish exactly, we
will need them for the dictionary with their χSF counterparts deﬁned below. Finally, the
fermion bilinear source ﬁelds at the lower time boundary are deﬁned by

5 =Z d3yd3z ¯ζf1(y)P+γ5ζf2(z),
Of1f2
k =Z d3yd3z ¯ζf1(y)P+γkζf2(z).
Of1f2

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

Note that the projector P+ must be written explicitly as we did not include it in the
deﬁnition of the fermionic boundary ﬁelds ζ and ¯ζ, Eq. (2.8). Integrating over the fermion
ﬁelds in the functional integral one obtains, for example,

fA(x0) =

1

2Z d3yd3zhtr{S(x; 0, y)P+γ5P−S(0, z; x)γ0γ5}iG ,

where h··· iG denotes the gauge ﬁeld average, S(x, y) the propagator for a single fermion
ﬂavour, and the trace is to be taken over colour and Dirac indices. The SF boundary
conditions in terms of the fermion propagator,

P+S(x, y)|x0=0 = 0 = S(x, y)P−|y0=0,

(2.25)

now imply that the correlation function vanishes if the projector in Eq. (2.22) is reverted,
In the lattice regularized theory this only holds after taking the continuum
P+ → P−.
limit and may thus be used as a check. Finally, we also need the boundary-to-boundary
correlators,

2.4 χSF correlation functions

To obtain correlation functions in the χSF we apply the identities (2.6),(2.7) to the standard
such

SF correlation functions. First we deﬁne the bilinear source ﬁelds Qf1f2

and Qf1f2

that they rotate into the standard SF sources (2.22),(2.23), i.e.

k

hO[R(π/2)ψ, ψR(π/2)]Qf1f2

5,k i( ˜Q+) = hO[ψ, ψ]Of1f2

5,k i(P+),

(2.29)

and the same for the primed source ﬁelds at the upper time boundary. In this way one
obtains, for example,

5 =Z d3yd3z ¯ζu(y)γ0γ5Q−ζu′(z),
Quu′
5 =Z d3yd3z ¯ζd(y)γ5Q−ζu(z),
Qdu

(2.30)

(2.31)

and the complete set of source ﬁelds can be found in Appendix A.

We now deﬁne the correlation functions for fermion bilinears X = V0, A0, S, P , by

gf1f2
X (x0) = −

1

2DX f1f2(x)Qf2f1

5,±E( ˜Q+)

,

(2.32)

where we label the correlation functions by the ﬂavour indices of the fermion bilinear
operator in the bulk. It is then straightforward to work out the relations (2.6),(2.7) for
these particular correlation functions:

fA = guu′
fP = iguu′
fV = guu′
fS = iguu′

A = gdd′
S =−igdd′
V = gdd′
P =−igdd′

A =−igud
S = gud
V =−igud
P = gud

V = igdu
V ,
P = gdu
P ,
A = igdu
A ,
S = gdu
S .

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

Hence, by using the chirally covariant deﬁnition of the boundary source ﬁelds, Eqs. (2.30)
and (2.31), the properties of the correlation functions gX under chiral rotations are the
same as for the inserted fermion bilinear operators.

Proceeding similarly for the source ﬁelds with an open spatial vector index, Eq. (2.23),

the correlation functions of the bilinear ﬁelds Yk = Ak, Vk, Tk0,eTk0 are deﬁned by

and their relations to the standard SF correlation functions are found to be,

kV = luu′
kA = luu′
kT = iluu′

k eT = iluu′

V = ldd′

(2.40)

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.43)

Again, the primed sources at the upper time boundary are chirally mapped to their stan-
dard SF counterparts, leading to rather simple entries for our dictionary,

f1 = guu′
k1 = luu′

1 = gdd′
1 = ldd′

1 = gud
1 = lud

1 = gdu
1 ,
1 = ldu
1 .

(2.44)

(2.45)

Note that, in the continuum, there are only 6 independent non-zero correlation functions,
namely fA, fP, f1 and kV, kT, k1 and the corresponding χSF correlation functions can be
looked up in the dictionary. As the standard SF correlation functions are real-valued, their
χSF counterparts must be either real or purely imaginary. While this dictionary is trivial
in the formal continuum theory, it does however lead to non-trivial consequences once the
lattice regularization with Wilson-type fermions is in place, due to the additional symmetry
breaking by the Wilson term.

3 Lattice set-up, renormalization and O(a) improvement

The lattice formulation of the standard Schr¨odinger functional on a lattice of spacing a and
size (T /a)× (L/a)3 is taken over from ref. [20]. The chirally rotated Schr¨odinger functional
will be used in the form described in ref. [2]. We refer to these references for unexplained
notation.

3.1 Lattice actions

The lattice action,

S[U, ψ, ψ] = Sg[U ] + Sf [U, ψ, ψ],

(3.1)

consists of a pure gauge and a fermionic part. For the former we choose Wilson’s plaquette
action [3],

Sg[U ] =

w(p)tr{1 − U (p)},

(3.2)

1
g2

0Xp

– 7 –

where the sum is over all oriented plaquettes p, and U (p) denotes the parallel transporter
around p, constructed from the link variables Uµ(x). We choose L-periodic boundary
conditions in all the spatial directions,

Uµ(x + Lˆk) = Uµ(x),

k = 1, 2, 3,

(3.3)

where ˆk denotes a unit vector in direction k. In the Euclidean time direction we choose
homogeneous boundary conditions for the spatial gauge potential at x0 = 0, T , i.e. the
spatial link variables at the boundaries are set to unit matrices,

Uk(0, x) = 1l = Uk(T, x),

k = 1, 2, 3 .

With these boundary conditions, the weight factors w(p) take the values

w(p) =(ct(g0)

1

if p is a time like plaquette attached to a boundary plane,

otherwise.

(3.4)

(3.5)

Here ct is an O(a) boundary counterterm coeﬃcient. Near the continuum limit it is seen to
multiply the dimension 4 operator tr{F0kF0k}, where Fµν denotes the gluonic ﬁeld strength
tensor. Disregarding fermion ﬁelds, this operator is the only non-vanishing boundary coun-
terterm at order a given our choice of boundary conditions. Hence, all O(a) eﬀects in the
pure gauge theory can be cancelled by choosing ct(g0) appropriately.
The fermionic ﬁelds ψ and ψ are taken to be L-periodic in space,

ψ(x + Lˆk) = ψ(x),

ψ(x + Lˆk) = ψ(x),

k = 1, 2, 3.

(3.6)

Apart from the SU(N ) gauge ﬁeld, the fermions are coupled to a constant U(1) background
ﬁeld λµ = exp(iaθµ/L), so that the covariant forward and backward derivatives are given
by

∇µψ(x) =
∇∗
µψ(x) =

a(cid:2)ψ(x) − λ−1

µ Uµ(x − aˆµ)†ψ(x − aˆµ)(cid:3).

(3.7)

(3.8)

We will always assume θ0 = 0 and θk = θ (k = 1, 2, 3), leaving θ as a single parameter. On
a lattice with inﬁnite Euclidean time extent the Wilson-Dirac operator can be written as
a ﬁnite diﬀerence operator in time,

aDW ψ(x) = −U0(x)P−ψ(x + aˆ0) + Kψ(x) − U0(x − aˆ0)†P+ψ(x − aˆ0),

Here, the last term is the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert term [22] in the notation of ref. [20].
Using a continuum-like normalisation, the fermionic action for either the standard SF or
the χSF takes the form,

Sf [U, ψ, ψ] = a4Xx

ψ(x) (DW + δDW + m0) ψ(x) ,

(3.11)

where DW is the reduction of the Wilson-Dirac operator to the ﬁnite time interval between
x0 = 0 and x0 = T , which incorporates the respective boundary conditions, and δDW
arises due to the fermionic boundary counterterms.

In the case of the χSF, three diﬀerent versions have been proposed in ref. [2] and we

here choose

aDW ψ(x) =

(3.12)
Note that the dynamical ﬁeld variables here include the fermion ﬁelds at Euclidean times
x0 = 0 and x0 = T , i.e. the sum over x0 in Eq. (3.11) runs from 0 to T . If the Sheikholeslami-
Wohlert term is included we set it to zero at the boundaries, even though the orbifold
construction yields a diﬀerent prescription [2]. The diﬀerence in the action is of O(a2) and
thus irrelevant. The boundary counterterms for the χSF are included by setting

δDW ψ(x) = (δx0,0 + δx0,T )h(zf − 1) + (ds − 1) aDsiψ(x),

Ds =

{(∇k + ∇∗

k)γk − a∇∗

(3.13)

(3.14)

and the values for the two coeﬃcients, zf and ds will be speciﬁed in Sect. 4. Note that this
deﬁnition of Ds diﬀers from [2] in that it also includes a second order derivative term3.

The Wilson-Dirac operator for the standard SF in the same notation reads

aDW ψ(x) =

−U0(x)P−ψ(x + aˆ0) + Kψ(x)
aDW ψ(x)
Kψ(x) − U0(x − aˆ0)†P+ψ(x − aˆ0)

if x0 = a ,
if a < x0 < T − a ,
for x0 = T − a .

(3.15)

In contrast to our chosen set-up for the χSF the dynamical fermionic ﬁeld variables in
the standard SF are restricted to Euclidean times 0 < x0 < T − a, i.e. the sum over x0
in Eq. (3.11) runs only from a to T − a. Finally, in the standard SF, the counterterm
contribution is given by

aδDW ψ(x) = (˜ct − 1) (δx0,a + δx0,T −a) ψ(x).

(3.16)

3The motivation is of purely technical origin as it led to a more transparent implementation of the

counterterm in the Monte Carlo simulation programs.

3.2 Lattice correlation functions

The correlation functions introduced in Sect. 2 can now easily be transcribed to the lattice.
One essentially needs to specify the boundary quark ﬁelds ζ and ¯ζ at time x0 = 0 and ζ ′
and ¯ζ ′ at time x0 = T . As before we leave out the projectors here and the notation is
therefore the same for both the SF and the χSF, i.e. in expectation values one performs
the replacement,

ζf (x) = U0(0, x)ψf (a, x),
¯ζf (x) = ψf (a, x)U0(0, x)†,

ζ ′
f (x) = U0(T − a, x)†ψf (T − a, x),
¯ζ ′
f (x) = ψf (T − a, x)U0(T − a, x).

(3.17)

(3.18)

Note that this correspondence is incomplete if the Wick contractions include two-point
functions with source and sink at the same boundary [2, 20]. Here we avoid this problem
by our choice of ﬂavour assignments in the correlation functions of Sect. 2. Note also that
we have left out the O(a) counterterm proportional to ¯ds [2], which can be included by the
replacement,

and similarly for ¯ζf and ζ ′
f . As will be further explained in Section 4, these O(a)
counterterms produce P5-odd contributions to P5-even observables aﬀecting the latter only
at O(a2).

f , ¯ζ ′

With these conventions the fermion-bilinear boundary sources are obtained from their

continuum counterparts by replacing the integrals over space by lattice sums4, e.g.

Of1f2
5 = a6˜c2

tXy,z

¯ζf1(y)P+γ5ζf2(z),

5 = a6Xy,z
Quu′

¯ζu(y)γ0γ5Q−ζu′(z),

(3.20)

and analogously for all other boundary source ﬁelds (cf. Appendix A).

Finally we mention that one may restrict attention to the ﬂavour combinations ud and
uu′ for all correlation functions, without loss of information. This is due to an exact lattice
symmetry, namely P -parity combined with up/down ﬂavour exchange, which may be used
to show that

gdu
X = ±gud
X ,

gdd′
X = ±guu′
X ,

(3.21)

and analogously for lY and the boundary-to-boundary correlation functions. Furthermore,
combining this with charge conjugation, some χSF correlation functions can be shown to
vanish identically, namely

S = guu′
gud

V = 0 = luu′

A = lud
eT

,

(3.22)

in addition to the SF correlation functions fV, fS and kA, k eT.

4In the standard SF the rescaling by ˜ct combines with the ˜ct-contribution to the Wilson-Dirac operator in
Eq. (3.16) to form the O(a) counterterm containing the time derivative [20]. Whether or not the coeﬃcient
appears explicitly or is included in the deﬁnition of the fermion boundary ﬁelds depends on the precise
deﬁnition of the latter.

3.3 Renormalization

Renormalization requires the introduction of renormalized parameters,

g2
R = Zg(g2

0, aµ)g2
0,

and renormalized composite ﬁelds,

mR = Zm(g2

0, aµ)(cid:0)m0 − mcr(g2
0)(cid:1) ,

[X f1f2]R = ZX(g2

0, aµ)X f1f2,

(3.23)

(3.24)

where µ denotes the renormalization scale and X = Aµ, Vµ, P, S, Tµν ,eTµν .

In addition
the boundary fermion ﬁelds ζ, ¯ζ and ζ ′, ¯ζ ′ are multiplicatively renormalized by a common,
scale dependent renormalization constant, Zζ [2, 20]. This implies that renormalized SF
correlation functions are of the form

[fX]R(x0) = Z 2

ζ ZXfX(x0),

[kY]R(x0) = Z 2

ζ ZYkY(x0),

(3.25)

and, for the boundary-to-boundary correlators,

[f1]R = Z 4

ζ f1,

[k1]R = Z 4

ζ k1 .

(3.26)

Provided the renormalization factors are chosen appropriately, one expects that the con-
tinuum limit can be taken at ﬁxed gR and mR. In this work we focus on the massless limit,
mR = 0 which implies that the bare mass, m0, is tuned to its critical value, mcr. As usual,
this can be achieved by tuning to the point in parameter space where the non-singlet axial
current is conserved. In terms of the SF correlation function one requires

˜∂0[fA]R(x0) = 0 ⇔ ˜∂0fA(x0) = 0 ,

(3.27)

for a chosen set of kinematical parameters x0, T /L and θ. Note that the chiral limit is
special in that the renormalization constant of the axial current drops out in Eq. (3.27).

The renormalization of the χSF correlation function is almost completely analogous,

i.e. one deﬁnes renormalized χSF correlation functions,

(cid:2)gf1f2
X (cid:3)R(x0) = Z 2
Y (cid:3)R(x0) = Z 2

(3.28)

(3.29)

and one may again determine the massless limit by requiring,

˜∂0gf1f2

A (x0) = 0 ,

(3.30)

for some choice of ﬂavour indices and kinematical parameters. However, with the χSF there
is the additional complication that the boundary conditions are not protected against renor-
malization [2]. In fact the scale-independent renormalization constant, zf (g0) in (3.13), is
required to ensure that the χSF boundary conditions and thus parity and ﬂavour symmetry
are restored up to cutoﬀ eﬀects. In order to determine zf one thus needs to require that
some parity breaking correlation function vanishes exactly already at ﬁnite lattice spacing.

– 11 –

From Section 2 we may choose any of the correlation functions on the RHS of Eqs. (2.35),
(2.36) or Eqs. (2.39),(2.41), which does not vanish exactly. An example would be to require

(cid:2)gud
A(cid:3)R(x0) = 0 ⇔ gud

A (x0) = 0,

(3.31)

again with some choice for the kinematical parameters. Choosing gud
A is in fact appealing
as it can be used to tune both the bare mass m0 and zf : up to cutoﬀ eﬀects, the mass
tuning renders gud
A (x0) by an
overall constant.

A (x0) independent of x0, whereas the tuning of zf shifts gud

3.4 Symanzik O(a) improvement

On-shell O(a) improvement in the chiral limit requires the inclusion of the Sheikholeslami-
Wohlert term in the action, with coeﬃcient csw. Furthermore, there are 2 improvement
coeﬃcients, namely ct, ˜ct in the case of the SF, and ct, ds in the case of the χSF, which are
required to cancel O(a) boundary eﬀects.

To obtain O(a) improved correlation functions one then needs to include the countert-
erms that are required for the fermion bilinear operators Aµ, Vµ and Tµ (cf. Appendix A),
with coeﬃcients cA, cV and cT, respectively. Note that this aﬀects the renormalization of
the mass, as the mass determined from the improved axial current depends on cA. In terms
of SF correlation functions the condition of vanishing mass changes by an O(a) oﬀset,

˜∂0fA(x0) = −cAa∂∗

0 ∂0fP(x0),

which directly translates to an O(a) oﬀset in the critical bare mass parameter. In other
words, to reduce the uncertainty in the renormalized mass to O(a2), both csw and cA are
required5. For the SF correlation functions discussed here this exhausts the list of required
O(a) improvement coeﬃcients. For the χSF, a further O(a) boundary counterterm with
coeﬃcient ¯ds is needed to correct the fermionic boundary ﬁelds ζ, ¯ζ and ζ ′, ¯ζ ′, cf. ref. [2]
and Eq. (3.19).

4 Theoretical expectations for the χSF

With the deﬁnitions made in the preceding sections we may now state our theoretical
expectations which will then be subjected to perturbative tests. We assume that m0 and,
in the case of the χSF, also zf have been determined as described in the previous section.

4.1 Boundary conditions and symmetry restoration

As discussed in ref. [2], the projectors ˜Q± in the χSF boundary conditions (2.4) correspond
to the special case α = π/2 of

P±(α) =

1

2(cid:16)1 ± γ0eiαγ5τ 3(cid:17) ,

P±(α = π/2) = ˜Q±.

(4.1)

5Incidentally, this fact has been used to obtain improvement conditions for the determination of both

csw and cA in [20].

– 12 –

While parity protects the value α = 0 even for the lattice regularized SF, there is no
lattice symmetry protecting the value α = π/2 in the case of the χSF. Hence, restoring
the P5 symmetry, Eq. (2.19), on the lattice up to O(a) eﬀects, through a condition like
Eq. (3.31) is tantamount to implementing the correct χSF boundary conditions. The
boundary conditions, on the other hand, can be more directly checked by reversing the
projectors Q± → Q∓ in the boundary fermion bilinear sources (cf. Appendix A). Note that
this reversal does not aﬀect P5-parity as the projectors Q± commute with P5. Denoting
the thus obtained but otherwise unchanged correlation functions by a subscript “−”, one
would like to check that

(x0) = 0,

(4.2)

lim

X,−iR
a→0hgf1f2

and analogously for lY, g1 and l1. We focus on the P5-even correlation functions and exclude
those correlation functions which are expected to vanish for being P5-odd. In practice it is
advantageous to cancel the multiplicative renormalization constants by forming ratios, i.e.

Rg,f1f2

X,− (x0) =

gf1f2
X,− (x0)
gf1f2
X (x0)

,

Rl,f1f2

Y,− (x0) =

lf1f2
Y,− (x0)
lf1f2
Y (x0)

.

(4.3)

While we expect these ratios to vanish in the continuum limit it is not immediately obvious
at which rate this should happen. We also note that the same question can be asked for
the standard SF, although in this case no tuning is required to ensure the correct boundary
conditions are obtained in the continuum limit.

4.2 Automatic O(a) improvement

Symanzik O(a) improvement applies to both the χSF and the SF as discussed in the
previous section. However with massless Wilson fermions and χSF boundary conditions
there is a simpliﬁcation due to automatic O(a) improvement [12], as explained in [2].
It is convenient to distinguish between diﬀerent kinds of O(a) eﬀects: these may either
arise from the bulk action and composite ﬁelds in the bulk, or from O(a) eﬀects due to
the presence of the boundaries. Bulk O(a) counterterms contribute at O(a2) to P5-even
observables, and at O(a) to P5-odd observables. In fact the latter are pure lattice artefacts
and would vanish if parity was exactly realized on the lattice. Since it is straightforward
to classify observables by P5 one may thus avoid O(a) eﬀects by restricting attention to
P5-even observables. This is known as the mechanism of automatic O(a) improvement [12].
Unfortunately, this nice pattern in the bulk is distorted by boundary O(a) eﬀects, which
can be due to both P5-even (ct, ds) and P5-odd ( ¯ds) counterterm insertions. Hence, those
renormalized χSF correlation functions which translate to fA, fP, f1 and kV, kT, k1, are
expected to approach the continuum limit with bulk O(a2) and boundary O(a) corrections;
the latter can be cancelled by appropriately tuning the boundary improvement coeﬃcients
ct and ds. This implies the possibility of using unimproved Wilson fermions and omitting
all O(a) counterterms to the composite ﬁelds in the bulk.

Note that the tuning conditions for mcr and zf generally deﬁne these parameters
up to an O(a) ambiguity, unless Symanzik O(a) improvement is implemented. Hence, if
zf is obtained from an alternative condition, one generally expects the diﬀerence, ∆zf ,

– 13 –

to asymptotically vanish at a rate of O(a), and the same applies to the critical mass,
mcr. We emphasise that these O(a) ambiguities are not in conﬂict with automatic O(a)
improvement [2]; for, treating any such O(a) shift of zf or mcr as an insertion of the
respective P5-odd counterterms into the P5-even correlation function of interest, the result
will be of O(a) and combine with the O(a) coeﬃcient to produce a total change of O(a2).
As mentioned above, P5-odd correlation functions are expected to vanish in the contin-
uum limit, at a rate linear in the lattice spacing. If correctly O(a) improved `a la Symanzik,
this rate should change to O(a2). Conversely, this fact may be used to obtain alterna-
tive O(a) improvement conditions. This is potentially very interesting but will be left to
future work. Here we will only verify that P5-odd observables vanish indeed at a rate
proportional to a. This includes the bulk O(a) counterterm contributions to the P5-even
correlation functions, guu′

V and lud
˜∂0guu′

P (x0),

T , namely
˜∂0luu′

T (x0),

˜∂0lud

V (x0) .

(4.4)

As these come with an explicit factor a, their contribution amounts to an O(a2) eﬀect.

4.3 Flavour symmetry restoration

Focussing on the boundary-to-boundary correlation functions, Eqs. (2.44),(2.45), we expect
that the chain of equalities on the RHS holds for renormalized correlation functions, so that
the ratios

Rg =

Rl =

(4.5)

guu′

should converge to 1 in the continuum limit, thereby demonstrating the restoration of
ﬂavour symmetry. Going a step further one may also show that the continuum limit is
reached with O(a2) corrections only: according to the above discussion of automatic O(a)
improvement, the only O(a) eﬀects can be caused by the P5-even boundary counterterms
with coeﬃcients ct and ds.
In a Symanzik type analysis of the cutoﬀ eﬀects we may
account for small changes ∆ct and ∆ds in these coeﬃcients by insertion of the respective
counterterms. Denoting these insertions by g1;ct and g1;ds, we then obtain e.g.

1

(cid:2)gf1f2

(cid:3)R = gf1f2

1 + a(cid:16)∆ctgf1f2

1;ct + ∆dsgf1f2

1;ds(cid:17) + O(a2) ,

where the correlation functions on the RHS are calculated in Symanzik’s eﬀective contin-
uum theory. Expanding the ﬁrst ratio, Rg, in Eq. (4.5), its expansion coeﬃcient at O(a)
has 2 parts,

Due to guu′

guu′

guu′

This is straightforward: the counterterms are both invariant under chiral and ﬂavour trans-
formations, which are the very symmetries of the continuum theory implying guu′
1 = gud

Hence the same relation must hold with the insertions of the counterterms.

4.4 Scale-independent renormalization constants

We now apply the same universality argument to correlation functions with fermion bilinear
ﬁelds in the bulk. Equating the right hand sides of Eq. (2.33), in terms of the renormalized
correlation functions, one obtains

Deﬁning the ratio of bare correlation functions,

ZV

+ O(a2) .

(4.11)

Here, the renormalization constants ZA and ZV are as required to restore the continuum
symmetries. We emphasize that these are the same continuum chiral and ﬂavour symme-
tries which are encoded in the corresponding Ward identities. Therefore, we expect that,
up to cutoﬀ eﬀects, ZA and ZV or their ratios must coincide with results obtained by
imposing Ward identities as normalization conditions [23, 24].

Why do we expect the cutoﬀ eﬀects to be of order a2 in Eq. (4.11)? Firstly, automatic
O(a) improvement implies the absence of bulk O(a) eﬀects from these ratios of P5-even
correlation functions. Secondly, O(a) corrections from the O(a) boundary counterterms
associated with ct and ds drop out in the ratio for the same reason this happens in the
ratios of boundary-to-boundary correlation functions, Eq. (4.5). This corresponds with a
similar argument [20] regarding Ward identities: the external source ﬁelds localised outside
the space-time region where the O(a) improved Ward identity is probed need not be O(a)
improved for the Ward identity to hold up to O(a2) eﬀects (cf. Section 6 of [20]).

At this point it is useful to recall that Wilson fermions in the bulk actually enjoy exact

lattice symmetries leading to the conserved vector currents,

µ

eV f1f2

(x) =

1

2(cid:20)ψf1(x)(γµ− 1)Uµ(x)ψf2(x+ aˆµ)+ ψf1(x+ aˆµ)(γµ + 1)Uµ(x)†ψf2(x)(cid:21) . (4.12)

We recall that in our conventions (i.e. the physical basis deﬁned by standard SF boundary
conditions, cf. Subsect 2.2) the symmetries associated with these vector currents are inter-
preted either as ﬂavour or chiral symmetry, depending on the ﬂavour assignments. In any
case, since Noether currents associated with exact lattice symmetries are protected against
renormalization one may infer that Z eV = 1, and, furthermore,

exactly, i.e. not just up to ﬁnite lattice spacing eﬀects. Therefore one expects

(4.13)

(4.14)

where this ratio is deﬁned as in Eq. (4.10) but with the conserved current, Eq. (4.12)
replacing the local current in the vector correlation function. Here we have again assumed
that the renormalized parameters and the kinematics have been chosen e.g. as discussed
after Eq. (4.10). Having a conserved vector current also allows for the determination of ZV
for the non-conserved local current, simply by taking the ratio

(4.16)

Finally, one can also determine the ﬁnite ratios among scale-dependent renormalization
constants that belong to the same chiral multiplet by considering the ratios,

(4.17)

(4.18)

where we emphasize that both renormalization constants are associated with the ﬂavour
non-singlet operators. Regarding the tensor densities we expect

Rl

T eT

= 1 + O(a2),

(4.19)

since the operators Tµν and eTµν are related by a lattice symmetry, cf. Appendix A.

4.5 Scale-dependent renormalization constants

So far we have used the universality relations to the right hand sides of our dictionary. A
more direct comparison between renormalized correlation functions calculated in the SF
and in the χSF is rendered diﬃcult by the fact that the bare boundary source ﬁelds O5
and Q5 are not simply related to each other, due to the very diﬀerent structure of the
lattice actions near the boundaries. This has to be contrasted with bare composite ﬁelds
in the bulk which can be chosen to be the same independently of the boundary conditions.
Consequently, if we deﬁne Zζ through the respective ratios

Z SF

ζ =(cid:16)f (0)

1 /f1(cid:17) 1

4 ,

(4.20)

the ratio of these Z-factors yields a scale independent constant which only logarithmically
approaches 1 in the continuum limit. Here, the numerators are the lowest order perturba-
tive expressions, e.g.

Z χSF

ζ =(cid:16)g(0)

1 /g1(cid:17) 1

4 ,

f (0)
1 = f1|g2

0=0,

– 16 –

(4.21)

such that the Z-factors are unity at leading order of perturbation theory.

Despite this limitation, we may compare scale-dependent renormalization constants
for bulk operators in SF renormalization schemes. For instance, the SF scheme for the
pseudo-scalar density can be deﬁned through [14, 25, 26],

where at a given renormalization scale µ = L−1 (deﬁned e.g. through the value of the
renormalized coupling) we require the renormalized matrix elements to be equal to their
tree level values at g0 = 0. The boundary-to-boundary correlators f1 and gud
1 are used to
cancel the boundary quark ﬁeld renormalization factors Zζ. The resulting expressions for
the renormalization constant of the pseudo-scalar density are then given by,

where the factors c and c′ are chosen such that Z SF,χSF
(0, L/a) = 1. Note that the
renormalization scale is ﬁxed in terms of L, the physical extent of the spatial volume.
This implies that all dimensionful parameters have to be scaled in a ﬁxed proportion to L.
Having set the mass to zero and x0 = T /2 one usually sets the aspect ratio ρ = T /L = 1 [25].
Finally one needs to ﬁx any dimensionless parameters, e.g. θ = 0.5, in order to completely
specify the SF scheme.

where again the factors b and b′ are chosen such that Z SF,χSF
(0, L/a) = 1 holds exactly
on a ﬁnite lattice with extent L/a. We note that the renormalization condition for the
pseudo-scalar density can be turned into a renormalization condition for the non-singlet
scalar density by combining it with an estimator of the ratio ZP/ZS, Eq. (4.18). We
also remark that, by applying the same SF renormalization procedure to scale-independent
renormalization problems, one may deﬁne e.g. a renormalized axial current in the SF scheme
with corresponding renormalization constants Z SF
A . However, we stress that such
a renormalized axial current is not canonically normalized, i.e. it does not satisfy the axial
Ward identities.

A and Z χSF

To conclude, we note that if O(a) improved Wilson fermions are used in both the SF

and χSF determinations, one expects, for X = P, T, . . .

provided that the boundary improvement coeﬃcients ct, ˜ct for the SF and ct, ds for the
χSF have been correctly tuned. In the case of the ratio of ZT’s the SF computation also
requires the necessary O(a) bulk counterterm for Tµν , otherwise uncancelled O(a) eﬀects
are expected in the ratio between the SF and χSF renormalization constants (4.25).

The tensor density provides a ﬁrst example where automatic O(a) improvement is

uum step-scaling function by σT(u) and with the correct choice for the boundary O(a)
improvement coeﬃcients ct and ds or ˜ct, we expect, in the case of the χSF,

ΣT(u, a/L) = σT(u) + O(a2).

(4.28)

In contrast, complete O(a) improvement with the standard SF also requires the inclusion
of the bulk counterterm ∝ cT (cf. Appendix A).

5 Perturbation theory

5.1 Perturbative expansion of parameters and correlation functions

The perturbative expansion of the renormalized correlation functions in (3.28) follows very
closely the literature [3, 27]. In particular, the gauge action remains the same, so that the
gauge ﬁxing procedure can be taken over unchanged.

The coeﬃcients in the action are functions of the bare coupling, and have a perturbative

expansion in g2
0,

c(g0) = c(0) + g2

0 c(1) + O(g4

0),

(5.1)

where c generically refers to mcr, zf , ds, ct, ˜ct. The tree-level values are given by [2, 3, 27],

m(0)

cr = 0,

z(0)
f = 1,

d(0)
s = 1/2,

(5.2)

and the one-loop coeﬃcients m(1)
factors are expanded similarly,

and d(1)

and c(1)

t

are given below. Renormalization

Z(g2

0, L/a) = 1 + g2

0 Z (1)(L/a) + O(g4

0),

(5.3)

where Z stands for Zζ or ZX in the case of fermion bilinear ﬁelds X f1f2. We distinguish
between renormalization scale-independent and scale-dependent renormalization factors.
Among the former are ZA, ZV and and ratios such as ZP/ZS, whereas ZP, ZS and ZT
depend on the renormalization scale µ = L−1 which, as before, has been identiﬁed with the
inverse of L, the linear extent of the spatial volume. To obtain renormalized correlation
functions in perturbation theory one may e.g. adopt the minimal subtraction of logarithms
scheme [21] with (µ = L−1). However, one must then still allow for ﬁnite renormalizations,

– 18 –

as otherwise the continuum relations between correlation functions will not hold in general.
More precisely, to renormalize consistently with the expected continuum relations derived
in Section 2, one may start and renormalize a given ﬁeld minimally but allow for ﬁnite
parts in the renormalization of its chirally transformed counterpart.

Given these deﬁnitions, ﬁxing the renormalized parameters gR and mR = 0 amounts

to tuning the bare parameters according to

g2
0 = g2

R + O(g4

R),

m0 = m(1)

cr g2

R + O(g4

R),

(5.4)

and, up to higher orders in the coupling, the boundary counterterm coeﬃcients are set to

zf = 1 + z(1)

f g2
R,

ds = 1

2 + d(1)

s g2
R,

˜ct = 1 + ˜c(1)

t g2
R,

ct = 1.

(5.5)

Note that, to the order considered, the gluonic boundary counterterm ∝ ct enters the
fermionic correlation functions only at tree-level via the gluon propagator. In order to de-
termine its one-loop value for the χSF we have also computed a gluonic observable, namely
the SF coupling constant at one-loop order (cf. Section 8). Except for this calculation we
stay with vanishing background gauge ﬁeld and thus only require csw to be set at tree-level,
i.e. csw = c(0)

sw = 1, 0, for O(a) improved and unimproved Wilson fermions, respectively.

We are now ready to expand the renormalized correlation functions in Eq. (3.28) in
R. Deﬁning the expansion coeﬃcients of the renormalized and O(a) improved

powers of g2

and similarly for g1. The correlation functions gδX refer to the bulk O(a) counterterms δX
associated with some of the fermion bilinear ﬁelds X (cf. Eqs. (A.4)) We have assumed
that their respective coeﬃcients cX vanish at tree-level, i.e. c(0)
X = 0, which is known to be
the case for the local bilinears (cf. Appendix A). Analogous expansions are obtained for
the correlation functions [lY]R and [l1]R, and also for the standard SF functions (with the
obvious modiﬁcations). The sums over n in (5.7) and (5.8) run over the set of all those
diagrams containing a gluon line (see Figures 1, 2 and 3). For later use we give the sum of
these diagrams a separate name,

and analogously for all other correlation functions. As we said, the terms with subscripts
“m0”, “zf ”, “ds” and “ ¯ds”, indicate the contributions due to insertions of the counterterms
proportional to these coeﬃcients. Diagrammatically these are represented by crosses on
the fermion lines. Note that we have included the counterterm ∝ ¯d(1)
for completeness
of notation, although this counterterm has been omitted in our calculation. While the ¯ds
counterterm is correctly implemented at tree level ( ¯d(0)
s = 0, cf. [2]), in the following we
omit the one-loop counterterm, eﬀectively setting ¯d(1)
s = 0 in Eqs. (5.7),(5.8), and all other
correlators. The reason this can be done consistently is that, by the mechanism of automatic
O(a) improvement, it only contributes O(a2) eﬀects to any of the P5-even correlation
functions. Its inclusion would however be required for the study of O(a) improvement for
the P5-odd correlation functions, which is beyond the scope of this work.

5.2 The numerical calculation and checks performed

All terms appearing in (5.7) and (5.8) are functions of a/L that can be evaluated numer-
ically by inserting the explicit time-momentum representation of the vertices and propa-
gators into the expressions of each diagram. To this end, we have produced a FORTRAN
program for the numerical evaluation of Feynman diagrams both in the standard and chi-
rally rotated SF. Numerical results for each diagram and counterterm have been compared
against previous calculations [28] in the case of the standard SF, ﬁnding agreement up to
rounding errors. For the χSF we have checked all diagrams for the gX and lY correlators by
an independent FORTRAN program, excluding the ones involving the point-split vector
current. A check for the latter has been performed by comparing ratios of correlators to
Monte-Carlo simulations at small values of the bare couplings, g2
0, cf. Appendix C. Further
conﬁdence in the correctness of our code is gained by the perfect agreement with results
in the literature for the current normalization constants (cf. Section 7). We have numeri-
cally checked gauge parameter independence for all correlators on small lattices and then
performed all subsequent calculations in the Feynman gauge (setting the gauge parameter
λ0 = 1), in which the gluon propagator for the plaquette action is diagonal. This allows for

bulk correlation functions involving the point-split vector current, i.e., gf1f2
. Note
that each diagram in the ﬁgure represents the two terms forming the point-split current
(4.12). The two fermion lines do not meet at the vertex due to the point-split nature of the
current, and gluons lines may originate from the gauge links that appear in the operator.

a considerable speed-up in the numerical computation. A technical point worth noting is
that we calculated the fermion propagator for ﬁxed spatial momentum by numerical matrix
inversion, as the available analytic result assumes ds = 1, whereas the correct tree-level
value is d(0)
s = 1/2 [2]. While it would have been possible to calculate an approximate
fermion propagator analytically by single or double insertion of the boundary counterterm,
we refrained from doing this as it would prevent a direct comparison with non-perturbative
data at ﬁnite lattice spacing.

In the remainder of this section we determine the one-loop parameters of the lattice

where we always assume x0 = T /2, and T = L. The determination of m(1)

particularly simple when choosing θ = 0. Indeed, for this choice, the contributions of the
counterterms proportional to ds, ¯ds and cA vanish. Moreover, for θ = 0, the contribution
of the counterterm proportional to z(1)

collected in Table 1 for the fundamental representation of the gauge group6. We reproduce
the values of m(1)

results only depend on the regularization of the bulk action, and are hence unaﬀected by
the choice of boundary conditions. This is a further strong check on the correctness of
our calculation. The values for z(1)

cf. Table 1.

We have analysed the sequence of values for L/a = 6, 8, . . . , 48 with the blocking procedure
of ref. [30]. Besides θ = 0.5 we have produced further data for the set of values θ =
0.1, 0.25, 0.75 and 1.0. In the case of the O(a) improved data c(0)

Note that this consistency indirectly veriﬁes automatic O(a) improvement, as it demon-
strates the irrelevance at O(a) of both the counterterm proportional to ¯ds (which was
omitted) and of the SW-term in the case of the unimproved Wilson fermion data.

5.5 Determination of c(1)

In order to obtain the complete set of χSF action parameters to order g2
like to compute the one-loop coeﬃcient,

(5.25)

for the lattice χSF regularization. However, ct multiplies a gluonic counterterm, so that the
fermionic correlation functions at one-loop order are only sensitive to its tree-level value,

– 25 –

c(0)
t = 1. We thus consider a gluonic observable, the SF coupling, ¯g2(L), deﬁned as the
response coeﬃcient to a chromo-electric background ﬁeld in ref. [3]. Expanding in the bare
coupling,

¯g2(L) = g2

0 + p1(L/a)g4

0 + O(g6

0),

(5.26)

the logarithmically divergent one-loop coeﬃcient, p1(L/a), decomposes into a purely glu-
onic, and a fermionic contribution,

p1(L/a) = p1,0(L/a) + Nf p1,1(L/a).

(5.27)

For gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3) the gluonic coeﬃcient p1,0 was ﬁrst computed in [3, 35]
and the fermionic part, p1,1, in ref. [29], for fermions in the fundamental representation
and with standard SF boundary conditions. Given the nature of these calculations with
a non-trivial gauge background ﬁeld, it is not obvious how these results depend on the
number of colours, N , and the fermion representation. This dependence has been worked
out in ref. [36] where the results are given for general N and SU(N ) group constants. In
particular the gluonic coeﬃcient, ﬁrst computed for SU(3) in ref. [35], takes the form,

c(1,0)

,

(5.28)

and is, to this order, independent of the fermion regularization. The analysis of p1,1(L/a)
nicely illustrates some of the main points of this paper and is left to Section 8. We here
just quote the result of this analysis for fermions in the fundamental representation,

The value for the standard SF is in perfect agreement with ref. [29]. According to ref. [36],
for a general fermion representation R these numbers need to be scaled by T (R)/T (F ),
with T (R) refers to the normalisation of the trace of two (hermitian) SU(N )-generators in
the representation R.7

6 Perturbative tests

Having determined the action parameters to O(g2
0) we may now test the theoretical ex-
pectations discussed in Sect. 4 to this order in perturbation theory. This section describes
our tests of the boundary conditions, the mechanism of automatic O(a) improvement, the
restoration of ﬂavour symmetry and a direct comparison between SF and χSF observables.

the structure of the action near the boundary. Testing whether the boundary conditions

and analogous expressions are obtained for other ratios in Eq. (4.3), and for the corre-
sponding ratios of standard SF correlation functions.

In order to evaluate the same ratios at one-loop order, we insert the series m(1)

Using these deﬁnitions we compute the tree-level and one-loop terms in (6.1) for all
the P5-even boundary-to-bulk correlation functions, for c(0)
sw = 1 and for θ = 0, 0.5, and
their standard SF counterparts. The tree-level ratios vanish exactly when θ = 0, both in
the χSF and in the standard SF. For θ = 0.5 instead, the tree-level ratios are non-zero at
ﬁnite lattice spacing, and vanish at a rate of O(a2), cf. Figure 5. We ﬁnd that the size
of the cutoﬀ eﬀects in both set-ups is comparable at tree-level. Note that the tree-level
correlators do not depend on c(0)
sw , due to our choice of the trivial gauge background ﬁeld.
cr (a/L)
and z(1)
f (a/L) obtained from gA at ﬁnite L/a and for θ = 0. The convergence to the
continuum limit of the ratios is displayed in Figure 6. We note that the ratios are very
small for the χSF already at the coarsest lattices, both for θ = 0 and 0.5. In the ﬁrst case,
cutoﬀ eﬀects are particularly suppressed, and seem to approach zero faster than O(a2)
(top-left panel of Figure 6), whereas the data for θ = 0.5 shows the O(a2) continuum
approach that one might have expected (top-right panel of Figure 6). For the standard
SF the ratios at one-loop, although still small, are an order of magnitude larger than
their χSF counterparts (see bottom panels of Figure 6).
In summary, we note that all
the ratios considered approach zero in the continuum limit, at least with a rate of O(a2).
This conﬁrms that the boundary conditions are correctly implemented to one-loop order
of perturbation theory.

6.2 Automatic O(a) improvement

As explained in Subsection 4.2 we may test automatic O(a) improvement either by con-
ﬁrming the O(a2) continuum approach of P5-even observables, or by showing that the
associated bulk O(a) counterterm contributions, or, more generally, P5-odd correlations
are pure O(a) eﬀects. Several examples of the former will appear below, where the absence
of cutoﬀ eﬀects linear in a is observed. We here focus on the P5-odd correlations functions,
which are the ones translating to fS, fV or kA, k eT according to our dictionary of Section 2.
Among those we omit the ones which vanish identically, Eq. (3.22), which leaves us with

We ﬁrst choose data at θ = 0, set x0 = T /2 and insert the series Eqs. (5.16),(5.17) for

already at ﬁnite lattice spacing. At one-loop order, the plots in Figure 7 show the results
for both c(0)
sw = 1 (right panel). While non-zero at ﬁnite lattice
spacing, all these P5-odd correlation functions do indeed vanish in the continuum limit, as
expected from automatic O(a) improvement. To understand the faster continuum approach
V , c(1)
in the case of c(0)

sw = 1, we note that with θ = 0 the counterterm insertions ∝ c(1)

The same holds for the ds-counterterm. However, both this and the ct-counterterm are P5-
even so that their contribution would anyway be at most an O(a2) eﬀect anyway. Hence, the
only relevant counterterm for O(a) improvement of these observables is the Sheikholeslami-
Wohlert term and its inclusion thus changes the rate of the approach to the continuum
limit from O(a) to O(a2). As an aside we remark that this observation could be used to
determine c(0)
sw and thus provides a perturbative example for the kind of O(a) improvement
conditions that can obtained from the χSF.

Passing to data for θ = 0.5 and c(0)

sw = 1, the P5-odd correlation functions are found to
vanish in the continuum limit, both at the tree- and one-loop level, with a rate of O(a) as
should be expected (cf. Figure 8). In conclusion, we conﬁrm that P5-odd observables are
indeed pure lattice artefacts, and conﬁrm that automatic O(a) improvement works out as
theoretically expected.

6.3 Flavour symmetry restoration

In order to check if ﬂavour symmetry is restored in the continuum limit, we consider
the relations between boundary-to-boundary correlation functions with diﬀerent ﬂavour
content. Taking the ratios in Eq. (4.5) and expanding them to order g2

6.4 Direct comparison SF vs. χSF

As explained in Sect. 4.5 the bare fermionic boundary source ﬁelds being diﬀerent presents
an obstacle when directly comparing fermionic correlation functions between the SF and
χSF. We are thus led to consider (double) ratios where the boundary source renormalization
factors Zζ are cancelled separately for SF and χSF observables, e.g.

.

(6.10)

RA =" [guu′
A ]Rq[guu′

]R# ×" [fA]Rp[f1]R#−1

1

,

1 ]R# ×" [fP]Rp[f1]R#−1
RP =" [gud
P ]Rq[gud

Such ratios are expected to approach 1 in the continuum limit, and similar ratios could
be obtained from the k- and l-functions, with vector and tensor bilinears. In fact, up to
a tree-level factor, all these double ratios correspond to ratios between Z-factors deﬁned
in SF schemes, cf. Eq. (4.26). Since the bare fermion bilinear operators and the bulk
lattice regularization here are taken to be the same for SF and χSF, the renormalization
factors must be equal up to cutoﬀ eﬀects. For these eﬀects to be reduced to O(a2) full
Symanzik improvement of the action and ﬁelds is required on the SF side. Note that
this requirement imposes the use of the improved action also for the χSF. Furthermore,
one needs to implement boundary O(a) improvement for the χSF by tuning ds and ct.
Automatic O(a) improvement of the χSF then ensures that the bulk O(a) counterterms to
the ﬁelds as well as the P5-odd boundary counterterm ∝ ¯ds do not contribute at O(a) and
may be omitted.

To study the continuum approach for RA and RP to O(g2

R), we expand the ratios in

A shows a small deviation from 1
which apparently vanishes even faster than O(a2) (see left panel of Figure 10). The one-
loop terms R(1)
sw = 1, θ = 0 and θ = 0.5 are displayed in the right
panel of Figure 10. Again we have inserted the ﬁnite a/L estimates of m(1)
cr (5.16) and of
z(1)
(5.17). Boundary O(a) improvement by the ds- and ˜ct-counterterms, respectively, has
f
been implemented. Furthermore, for θ = 0.5, the correlation function f (1)
A receives a con-
tribution from the operator improvement counterterm proportional to cA, which vanishes
for θ = 0. We thus also consider f (1)
A with the improved axial current AI and label the
corresponding ratio of correlation functions as R(1)
. In all cases considered, the one-loop
AI
ratios R(1)
X converge to 0, thus conﬁrming the expectation of universality. Furthermore, the
convergence rate is found to be O(a2) provided O(a) improvement is correctly implemented
at the boundaries and in the bulk for the action and the SF correlation functions. Again,
this indirectly conﬁrms automatic O(a) improvement, as the omitted P5-odd counterterms
∝ ¯ds and ∝ cA on the χSF side are not required.

7 Applications based on universality

In this section we now assume universality and demonstrate the determination of scale
independent renormalization factors like ZA or ZV, which are traditionally obtained from
chiral and ﬂavour Ward identities, respectively. We then take another look at SF schemes
for the pseudo-scalar and tensor densities, and study both the renormalization factors and
the associated step-scaling functions.

– 32 –

7.1 Scale-independent renormalization factors

We now consider the ratios of Subsect. 4.4, which should yield the scale independent factors
ZA and ZV and the scale independent ratios ZP/ZS and ZT/Z eT, up to cutoﬀ eﬀects of order
a2. Taking for example Rg

, Eq. (4.15), we write the perturbative expansion,

V ˜V

Rg

V eV

= Rg(0)
V eV

+ g2

RRg(1)
V eV

+ O(g4

R) .

(7.1)

We set x0 = T /2 and T = L and then expect the tree-level term to approach unity with
O(a2) corrections and we ﬁnd this is indeed the case. Focusing on the one-loop contribution,
we simplify notation by writing

Rg(1)
V eV

= Z g(1)

V (L/a),

(7.2)

and similarly for the other estimators of Subsect. 4.4, including those which yield ratios of
Z-factors, e.g.

Rg(1)

PS = [ZP/ZS](1)(L/a),

(7.3)

and the superscript g or l referring to the gX or lY correlation functions is only used when
a confusion is possible. Note that, besides the P5-odd ¯ds-counterterm, we also omit the
ds-counterterm at one-loop order: for θ = 0 it vanishes exactly, however, in general it is
expected to be irrelevant for the O(a) improvement of such ratios and will at most cause
additional O(a2) eﬀects (cf. Section 4). We have veriﬁed this expectation explicitly by
studying the combination of ds-counterterm insertions entering the one-loop Z-factors. In
the case of the vector current normalization constants this combination is even found to
vanish exactly.

Following Symanzik analysis of cutoﬀ eﬀects, one then expects that as a/L → 0 the

terms Z (1)

X are described by the asymptotic series,

Z (1)
X (L/a) ∼

∞Xn=0

[rX,n + sX,n ln(L/a)] (a/L)n.

(7.4)

The coeﬃcient rX,0 is the ﬁnite asymptotic value of Z (1)
X . For scale independent renor-
malization constants, the coeﬃcient multiplying the logarithmic divergence must be zero
i.e. sX,0 = 0. All subsequent coeﬃcients in Eq. (7.4) describe the cutoﬀ eﬀects in Z (1)
X (L/a).
The term linear in a/L should be absent according to the discussion in Subsect. 4.4 re-
garding the boundary O(a) eﬀects. The term proportional to sX,1 is 0 provided that O(a)
eﬀects are absent in the bulk.

We obtain the ﬁrst asymptotic coeﬃcients in (7.4) following the blocking procedure
described in [30]. For all cases we conﬁrm that the coeﬃcients sX,0, rX,1 and sX,1 are
compatible with zero up to at least 5 decimal digits. Assuming these to be zero in the
subsequent analysis, we can then easily extract the asymptotic values rX,0. The results are
collected in Table 2.

Within the quoted errors the asymptotic values for Z (1)

A calculated using the
g- and the l-functions are in agreement with each other. We also found agreement with
the literature [37–41] for all renormalization factors, indicating that the method described
in Subsection 4.4 for deﬁning ﬁnite renormalization constants is well-founded.

7.1.1 Lattice artefacts

Next, we consider the cutoﬀ eﬀects in the ﬁnite renormalization factors to O(g2
0) in per-
turbation theory. At tree-level and one-loop order we deﬁne the diﬀerence between a given
renormalization constant at ﬁnite lattice spacing and its asymptotic value, i.e.,

δ(i)ZX(L/a) = Z (i)

X (L/a) − Z (i)
X ,

i = 0, 1.

(7.5)

In view of non-perturbative applications we will focus on the case of O(a) improved action
and set c(0)

sw = 1.

At tree-level, all renormalizaton constants are unity, Z (0)

of θ = 0 this is also true at ﬁnite lattice spacing, i.e. Z (0)
eﬀects vanish exactly, δZX
δZ g(0)
all other cases (including δZ l(0)
and also vanish at a higher rate than the expected O(a2).

X = 1. For the particular choice
X (L/a) = 1, and hence the cutoﬀ
(0)(a/L) = 0 for all a/L. For θ = 0.5, the tree-level cutoﬀ eﬀects
are numerically around 0.01 for L/a = 6 and vanish at a rate ∝ a2. In
A ) the cutoﬀ eﬀects are numerically much smaller

The one-loop cutoﬀ eﬀects in ZV and ZA are shown in Figure 11 for θ = 0 and 0.5. We
(cf. Table 1)

study the cutoﬀ eﬀects obtained by using the asymptotic values of m(1)
in the expansions of ZV and ZA, and also those obtained using the values m(1)
cr (a/L) and
z(1)
f (a/L) at ﬁnite L/a and for θ = 0 from Eqs. (5.16),(5.17). The latter are denoted
X , whereas the former are labelled δZ (1)
δZ (1)
X,as. The qualitative picture is similar to that
observed at tree-level8. Cutoﬀ eﬀects associated to the deﬁnitions Z l
A are always
very small even at the coarsest lattices, in contrast to the deﬁnitions Z g
A where we
observe considerably larger but still rather small eﬀects. An interesting observation is that
the insertion of the mass counterterm causes an O(1) eﬀect on Z g
A, whereas it is
suppressed by a further power of a/L for Z l
A. The O(1) behaviour is expected since
the insertion of the P5-odd mass counterterm into the P5-even observables combines a power
of a/L with a linear divergence ∝ L/a. What comes as a surprise is the above mentioned
additional O(a/L) suppression, which is also seen for the ratio of tensor densities and in
the pseudo-scalar to scalar ratio. Similarly, regarding the zf -counterterm we ﬁnd that its
insertion combines to an O(a2) eﬀect in all cases, except for the vector current where it
vanishes exactly. Finally, we recall that the ds-counterterm vanishes exactly at θ = 0,

8However, diﬀerently to the tree-level case, cutoﬀ eﬀects at one-loop are non-zero even if θ = 0.

– 34 –

whereas for θ = 0.5 its contributions are at least of O(a2) and numerically insigniﬁcant in
all cases, due also to the smallness of d(1)
[cf. Eq. (5.24)]. Regarding P5-odd counterterms,
s
we ﬁnd no sign of an O(a) contamination due to either the ¯ds-counterterm or the bulk
counterterm to the axial current ∝ cA. The latter contributes higher order eﬀects to Z g
A,
however, these are numerically small so that we have omitted these data in ﬁgure 11. In
conclusion, in all cases cutoﬀ eﬀects vanish proportionally to (a/L)2, nicely conﬁrming the
theoretical expectations expressed in Section 4.

Here we compute to one-loop order in perturbation theory the scale-dependent renor-

T at θ = 0.5, where its contribution is so
small as to be below our resolution for the O(a) coeﬃcient rT,1 and can be safely ne-
glected. We then conﬁrm that for all cases the coeﬃcients rX,1 and sX,1 are compatible
with zero to least 4 decimal digits. For the θ = 0.5 data and to this level of precision we
may therefore exclude contributions at O(a) from the omitted ¯ds-counterterm, as well as
from the bulk O(a) counterterm ∝ cT in the case of the tensor density, thereby providing
further evidence for automatic O(a) improvement.

asymptotic values of m(1)
f , and we have again omitted the vanishing or (in the
case of the tensor density) numerically very small ds-counterterm contributions.
In all
cases the convergence to the continuum limit is dominated by (a/L)2 eﬀects already at
intermediate lattice sizes. Lattice artefacts turn out to be smaller for θ = 0.5 than for
θ = 0. This diﬀerence is particularly pronounced for ΣT, for which cutoﬀ eﬀects are quite
large at θ = 0. Note that a similar observation was made for the cutoﬀ eﬀects in ΣP when
calculated in the standard SF [25].

8 The standard SF coupling and ct to one-loop order

We here consider the SF coupling as introduced in [3]. Apart from the calculation of the
gluonic counterterm ∝ ct to order g2
0, this provides yet another conﬁrmation of universality

and automatic O(a) improvement. With boundary O(a) improvement in place we also
compare the residual lattice eﬀects in the χSF regularized step scaling functions to the
standard SF. In this section we restrict attention to lattice QCD i.e. we assume N = 3 and
fermions in the fundamental representation.

8.1 Analysis of the fermionic one-loop coeﬃcient p1,1(L/a)

Taking the expansion of the renormalized SF coupling in g2
0, Eq. (5.26), as starting point,
the fermionic coeﬃcient p1,1(L/a) can be calculated as in ref. [29], for a given lattice
resolution L/a using a recursive evaluation of the determinant for ﬁxed spatial momentum
and colour component. The necessary modiﬁcations due to χSF boundary conditions are
described in Appendix B. We have written 2 independent FORTRAN codes implementing
both SF and χSF boundary conditions. Perfect agreement (up to rounding errors) was
found between both codes using double precision arithmetic. One of the codes was then
used to produce data fo p1,1(L/a) in quadruple (128 bit) precision arithmetic, for θ = π/5,
both for csw = 0 and csw = 1 and for a range of lattice sizes up to L/a = 64. We have used
the asymptotic tree-level values for the fermionic action parameters z(0)
cr = 0
and d(0)
the fermionic contribution, c(1,1)
For a/L → 0 one then expects the data to show the asymptotic behaviour,

The logarithmic divergence must be cancelled by the coupling renormalization, implying
that its coeﬃcient, s0, must be given in terms of the one-loop β-function. Using the

12π2 ≈ −0.008443431966 .

(8.3)

We extracted the asymptotic coeﬃcients of p1,1 from the numerical results following the
method described in [30]. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed the expected value for s0 for all data sets
with a relative precision better than 1 in 104. Then we subtracted s0 ln(L/a) from the data
using the analytically expected coeﬃcient for s0. This improves the attainable precision
for the analysis of the remaining coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcient r0 depends on the details of
the chosen renormalization scheme for the SF coupling, such as the choice of θ, the aspect
ratio T /L or the parameters of the background gauge ﬁeld. Its value also depends on the
regularization through the bare coupling used in the expansion (5.26). This regularization
dependence disappears once the bare coupling is replaced e.g. by the MS coupling (cf. [29]).
For r0 we ﬁnd complete agreement with ref. [29], with comparable precision,

r0(cid:12)(cid:12)χSF, θ=π/5, c(0)

r0(cid:12)(cid:12)χSF ,θ=π/5, c(0)

sw =1

= −0.0346649(1),

sw =0

= −0.0098682(1),

(8.4)

and similarly for data at θ = 0, thereby completely conﬁrming the expectation regarding
universality.

The coeﬃcients r1 and s1 are relevant for O(a) improvement. In particular, with the
standard SF, s1 was found to vanish only for c(0)
sw = 1, and is therefore related to bulk
O(a) improvement. For the χSF we thus expect that automatic O(a) improvement implies
s1 = 0, independently of csw. Indeed we ﬁnd that for all our χSF data sets |s1| < 10−4,
thus conﬁrming the expectation.

Finally, the coeﬃcient r1 is related to boundary O(a) eﬀects. From the θ = π/5 data

set with csw = 1, we obtain

r1(cid:12)(cid:12)χSF, θ=π/5, c(0)

sw =1

= −2c(1,1)

t

+ 0.01378(1).

(8.5)

Requiring the absence of O(a) eﬀects in the SF coupling at one-loop order means r1 = 0, and
thus determines c(1,1)
. Note that this result must be independent of θ or other kinematical
parameters. We have checked that the result (8.5) is reproduced within errors with data
at θ = 0.

t

For the χSF data with csw = 0 the corresponding result is

r1(cid:12)(cid:12)χSF, θ=π/5, c(0)

sw =0

= −2c(1,1)

t

− 0.01322(1) ,

(8.6)

independently of θ. Note that this is in contrast to the standard SF where r1 is found to
be θ-dependent, indicating that boundary O(a) improvement in the standard SF cannot be
achieved separately from bulk O(a) improvement. As our data shows, with the χSF this
is indeed possible. More abstractly, this is due to the fact that P5-parity distinguishes the
even O(a) boundary counterterms (∝ ct, ds) from the odd bulk O(a) counterterm ∝ csw.

8.2 Residual cutoﬀ eﬀects in the step-scaling function

In non-perturbative applications the scale evolution of the SF coupling can be traced with
the help of the step scaling function (SSF) [42],

σ(u) = g2(2L)(cid:12)(cid:12)u=g2(L) ,

(8.7)

which relates the value u of the coupling g2 at a scale L to its value at a scale 2L. The lattice
version Σ(u, L/a) of the step scaling function depends on the details of the regularization
and converges to (8.7) in the continuum limit,

σ(u) = lim

a/L→0

Σ(u, a/L).

(8.8)

Both continuum and lattice versions of the SSF are expanded in perturbation theory as,

σ(u) = u + σ1u2 + O(u3),

Σ(u, a/L) = u + Σ1(a/L)u2 + O(u3),

(8.9)

with the 1-loop terms given by

σ1 = 2b0 ln(2),

Σ1(a/L) = p1(2L/a) − p1(L/a).

(8.10)

We would like to monitor the size of the lattice artefacts in the fermionic contribution to
the SSF. Isolating the part ∝ Nf ,

Σ1(L/a) = Σ1,0(L/a) + Nf Σ1,1(L/a),

(8.11)

and analogously for σ1, their relative diﬀerence,

δ1,1(a/L) =

Σ1,1(L/a) − σ1,1

σ1,1

,

(8.12)

is shown in Figure 14 for diﬀerent levels of improvement. For the χSF (Figure 14, right
panel), the cutoﬀ eﬀects are asymptotically O(a2) once c(1,1)
is ﬁxed to the correct value
(5.29). Note that boundary O(a) eﬀects are very diﬀerent between csw = 0 or 1. Somewhat
surprisingly, once these are removed by including the respective values for c(1,1)
, the re-
maining cutoﬀ eﬀects are quite similar for csw = 0 and csw = 1. For the standard SF (Figure
(14), left panel), cutoﬀ eﬀects are essentially zero after O(a) improvement is implemented
in the bulk and at the boundaries. This smallness of the remaining cutoﬀ eﬀects seems to
be an accident for this particular choice of background ﬁeld and kinematical parameters.

9 Conclusions

In this paper we have deﬁned a complete set of boundary-to-bulk and boundary-to-boundary
correlation functions with both χSF and standard SF boundary conditions. Universality
allows to establish a dictionary between both sets which should be applicable to appropri-
ately renormalized correlation functions. We have discussed renormalization and Symanzik
O(a) improvement in terms of these correlation functions. We have then formulated a few

theoretical expectations, from the restoration of χSF boundary conditions, ﬂavour and
parity symmetry, to automatic O(a) improvement, all of which follow from the assumption
of a universal continuum limit. We have thus provided the framework for applications and
checks of the χSF both in perturbation theory and beyond.

We have then carried out the perturbative expansion in order to test the theoretical
expectations to one-loop order. Based on numerical data for a range of lattice sizes from
L/a = 6 to L/a = 48 (for both SF and χSF with and without the SW-term), we have ﬁrst
calculated the action counterterm coeﬃcients mcr zf and ct, ds to order g2
0. The critical
mass mcr and the renormalization constant zf are required to restore physical parity and
ﬂavour symmetries which are broken at ﬁnite lattice spacing. Their determination is thus a
pre-condition for any further tests regarding the continuum limit. The counterterms with
coeﬃcients ct, ds remove O(a) eﬀects originating from the time boundaries (analogous to
ct, ˜ct in the standard SF).

Having determined the action to this order we have performed the following tests:
ﬁrst, we have conﬁrmed that the correct boundary conditions are implemented on the
lattice. This was done by reversing the projectors in the boundary sources such as to
project on the expected Dirichlet components of the fermionic boundary ﬁelds. The mod-
iﬁed correlation functions were then seen to vanish in the continuum limit, with O(a2)
corrections. For comparison we also looked at the corresponding SF correlation functions,
where comparable if larger cutoﬀ eﬀects are observed. Secondly, we have veriﬁed that
ﬂavour symmetry is restored in the continuum limit. This has been done by checking
that ratios of boundary-to-boundary correlation functions with diﬀerent ﬂavour content
converge to unity, such that the continuum relations (2.44),(2.45) are satisﬁed. We then
studied ratios of boundary-to-bulk correlation functions which should also approach unity,
provided the fermion bilinear operators in the bulk are correctly renormalized. This was

– 41 –

conﬁrmed and reproduced a number of results from the literature for ratios of fermion
bilinear renormalization constants. Next, we have conﬁrmed the universality between the
SF and χSF set-ups by comparing renormalization constants for the pseudoscalar and ten-
sor densities in SF schemes. Finally, we have checked that the mechanism of automatic
O(a) improvement works as expected. This was done directly, by observing that a set of
P5-odd correlation functions vanish with a rate of O(a), and indirectly by observing the
absence of O(a) terms in P5-even observables, the cancellation of which would require the
O(a) bulk counterterms. In summary, the perturbative study fully conﬁrms all theoretical
expectations and lends further support to the χSF framework.

With the χSF ﬁrmly established as a new tool, we would like to give a short outlook on
current and future applications. With automatic O(a) improvement in place, any bulk O(a)
eﬀect in physical observables vanishes without the need to tune either the csw coeﬃcient in
the action or any of the operator improvement coeﬃcients. This last property is particularly
appealing when studying the renormalization of complicated operators such as 4-fermion
or higher-twist operators, where the non-perturbative determination of improvement coef-
ﬁcients is diﬃcult or impractical. A project to determine the step-scaling functions for a
complete set of 4-quark operators in lattice QCD is currently in progress [43, 44]. In this
context we remark that, in practice, it seems advantageous to include the clover term in
the action, as it drastically reduces the O(a) ambiguity in the critical mass, even if the
axial current in the PCAC relation remains unimproved. This in turn renders the tuning of
zf easier and higher order cutoﬀ eﬀects seem strongly reduced, even though the qualitative
asymptotic behaviour is expected to remain unchanged. This feature has been observed
before in the quenched approximation [14] and is now conﬁrmed by our perturbative study.
In a forthcoming non-perturbative study [45] we will present further non-perturbative
tests of the χSF and, in particular, results for the non-singlet current normalization con-
stants, ZA and ZV (for preliminary results in Nf = 2 lattice QCD cf. [19]). In this context,
perturbation theory allows to make an informed choice of the parameters and to pertur-
batively eliminate cutoﬀ eﬀects from the numerical simulation data.

As a further promising application of the χSF we envisage the determination of the
bulk O(a) improvement coeﬃcients csw, cA, cV, cT. Convenient improvement conditions
can be obtained by requiring some P5-odd observables to vanish exactly (besides the one
used to determine zf ). A systematic investigation along these lines both in perturbation
theory and non-perturbatively is left to future work.

B One-loop contribution to the SF coupling from fermions in the χSF

We present a few details on the perturbative calculation of the coeﬃcient p1,1(L/a) in
Eqs. (5.26) and (5.27) with χSF boundary conditions. The discussion follows very closely
Appendix A of ref. [29], where the coeﬃcient p1,1(L/a) was calculated for the standard SF.
The reader will be assumed to be familiar with this reference, as we will adopt much of the
notation from there without further notice (in particular we use lattice units a = 1 and
t = x0 for Euclidean time).

For deﬁniteness we assume a doublet with Nf = 2 ﬂavours. One then has

p1,1 =

1
2k

∂
∂η

ln det (DW + δDW + m0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Uµ(x)=Vµ(x)

where DW + δDW is the χSF Dirac operator including the counterterms, Eqs. (3.12),(3.13),
Vµ(x) denotes the Abelian background ﬁeld which depends on the parameters η and ν,
which are set to zero after diﬀerentiation by η. Finally, k is the tree-level normalization
constant which ensures the correct normalization of the SF coupling (cf. [29, 35]). The
large determinant in Eq. (B.1) can be reduced to subsectors of ﬁxed spatial momentum p,
colour nc and ﬂavour f , such that

The ﬂavour structure can be further reduced to the up-type determinant by recalling from
ref. [2] that

W(cid:17)†
W = γ5(cid:16)D(d)
D(u)

γ5,

(B.3)

so that their determinants are complex conjugate to each other. Moreover, we anticipate
that both determinants are real when taken in the Abelian background ﬁelds, so that we
can omit the modulus and obtain:

p1,1(L/a) =

1

3Xnc=1Xp

∂
∂η

ln det D(u)(nc, p)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)η=ν=0

(B.4)

The task is thus reduced to many evaluations of (the η-derivative of) the determinant
of D(u) for ﬁxed colour and spatial momentum, which corresponds to a matrix of size
4(T + 1) × 4(T + 1). This is most eﬃciently done by setting up a recursion relation in
Euclidean time, following refs. [3, 29]. The starting point is an eigenvalue equation for a
hermitian operator, which requires us to temporarily remain in 2-ﬂavour space and consider:

(cid:0)γ5τ 1D − µ(cid:1) f (t) = 0 .

(B.5)

The reduced operator D = diag(cid:0)D(u),D(d)(cid:1) acts on eigenfunctions f (t) as a ﬁnite diﬀerence

operator in Euclidean time,

(Df ) (t) = −P−f (t + 1) + h(t)f (t) − P+f (t − 1) ,

(B.6)

where we have extended the functions f (t) beyond the interval [0, T ] by setting

f (−1) = −iγ0γ5τ 3f (0),

f (T + 1) = iγ0γ5τ 3f (T ),

(B.7)

and f (t) = 0 for t < −1 and t > T + 1. In the notation of [29], the function h(t) is given
by

h(t) = 1 + m0 + i˜qk(t)γk +

where summation over repeated spatial indices is assumed. Note that, at the boundaries
t = 0 and t = T , the function h(t) contains the contribution coming from the boundary
counterterms and the term proportional to csw is absent (cf. Section 3).

To obtain a ﬁrst order recursion we now reformulate [29],

F (t) = P−f (t) + P+f (t − 1),

0 ≤ t ≤ T + 1 ,

and, as a consequence of eq.(B.7), F (t) satisﬁes the boundary conditions

˜Q+F (0) = 0,

˜Q−F (T + 1) = 0.

(B.9)

(B.10)

The eigenvalue equation (B.5) now takes the form of a ﬁrst order recursion relation,

F (t + 1) = A(t)F (t),

(B.11)

with

A(t) = −a(t)−1(cid:8)P−(cid:2)µ2 − a(t)2 + µγ5τ 1 (ck(t)γk − bk(t)γk + 1)

+ck(t)γk (bj(t)γj − 1)]

+ P+(cid:2)bk(t)γk − µγ5τ 1 − 1(cid:3)(cid:9) .

The coeﬃcients a(t), bk(t) and ck(t) are scalar functions of t given by

a(t) = 1 + m0 +

After T + 1 steps one arrives at F (T + 1) which depends linearly on F (0), through

F (T + 1) = M

˜Q(µ)F (0) ,

The boundary conditions (B.10) then imply

In practice it is slightly inconvenient to choose a representation of the γ-algebra where ˜Q±
are diagonal. Using diagonal γ0 instead, one may perform a unitary rotation,

U † ˜Q±U = P±,

where U = (1 − iτ 3γ5)/√2,

and use the P± projectors. More precisely, Eq.(B.16) reads,

U †F (T + 1) = U †M

˜Q(µ)U U †F (0) ,

(B.19)

(B.20)

and the boundary conditions for U †F are now given in terms of the P± projectors,

P+U †F (0) = U † ˜Q+F (0) = 0 ,

P−U †F (T + 1) = U † ˜Q−F (T + 1) = 0 .

In order to further corroborate the perturbative results we obtained for the ﬁnite renor-
malization constants ZV and ZA involving the point-split current, we decided to compare
the determinations with results from Monte Carlo simulations at small values of the bare
coupling g0. To this end, we performed simulations at a ﬁxed lattice size L/a = 8, and for
25 diﬀerent values of β = 6/g2
0) only
gluonic loops appear in the perturbative expansion of the fermionic correlation functions
entering the deﬁnition of ZA,V (cf. Figure 1 and 3). This allowed us to simply generate pure
SU(3) gauge-ﬁeld conﬁgurations on which we measured the relevant fermionic correlators.
For the comparison to be meaningful the Monte Carlo determinations need to mimic
exactly the perturbative computations. This means that the lattice set-up, as well as the
values for the bare parameters and improvement coeﬃcients need to be the same in the
two computations. We therefore set ρ = T /L = 1 and θ = 0. For the bare parameters we
took: m0(g0) = m(1)
f (L/a)
were given by Eqs. (5.16),(5.17) with L/a = 8. Finally, for the improvement coeﬃcients
we considered their asymptotic values up to the relevant order of perturbation theory.
Speciﬁcally, we set the boundary improvement coeﬃcients ds(g0) = 1
0, ct = 1, and
¯ds = 0 (cf. Section 5), while for the bulk improvement coeﬃcients we chose csw = 1, and
cA = cV = c eV = 0.

in the middle of the lattice i.e. for x0 = T /2.

In order to conﬁrm that the bare parameters m0(g0) and zf (g0) were chosen properly,
we checked whether the conditions (3.30) and (3.31) were realized up to O(g4
0) corrections.
The results for the corresponding quantities are show in Figure 15. As we can see, the data
are very well described by a pure O(g4
0) eﬀect over the whole range of g0 we investigated.
The renormalization conditions are then satisﬁed up to 1-loop order in perturbation theory.

In Figure 16, instead, we present the results for the two deﬁnitions of ZV (left panel),
and ZA (right panel). Speciﬁcally, after verifying that ZV and ZA extrapolated correctly
to 1 for g0 → 0, we looked at (ZX − 1)/g2
0 , X = V, A, in order to extract the 1-loop
coeﬃcients Z (1)
X (L/a) to be compared with perturbation theory. As we can see from the
ﬁgure, there is nice agreement between the perturbative and Monte Carlo determinations.
We note that Z (1)
X (L/a) was obtained from the Monte Carlo data by considering a linear
0 with respect to g2
ﬁt of (ZX − 1)/g2
0, including all but the largest value of g0 we simulated.
For completeness, we collected in Table 4 the results from 1-loop perturbation theory, and
the results of the extrapolations of the Monte Carlo data.
