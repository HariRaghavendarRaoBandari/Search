A systematic study of hadron masses and widths shows regular oscillations that can be ﬁtted by a
simple cosine function. This property can be observed when the diﬀerence between adjacent masses
of each family is plotted versus the mean mass.

INTRODUCTION

of the function:

The non-perturbative structure of hadrons is the ob-
ject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies.
The origin of the mass itself is not yet elucidated as the
constituent quarks bring only few percent of the total
mass. It is believed that most of the mass is dynamically
generated, involving gluons and meson cloud. In general
one can say that the existence of composite hadrons, re-
sults from the addition of several forces, related to strong
interaction, that combine in, at least, one attractive and
one repulsive force. The equilibrium among these forces
allows the hadron to exist, otherwise the composite mass
will either disintegrate, or mix into a totally new object
with loss of the individual components.

A known example is the charmonium spectrum. The
charmonium is considered the analogue in QCD as
positronium in QED. The spectrum of charmonium, like
bottomonium, is very similar (apart from the scale) to
the spectrum of positronium. It may be described by a
Coulomb-like potential and a term which takes care of
conﬁnement V ≃ αr + 1/2kr2. It is understood that the
interplay created by repulsive and attractive forces gives
rise at the equilibrium to a local harmonic oscillator-like
potential. It is therefore not surprising that static and
dynamic properties of hadrons or resonances, as masses,
energies and widths show oscillatory behavior, that may
be experimentally observable.

Since a rather long time, oscillatory properties have
been studied concerning neutrino diﬀerence square
masses, or particle-antiparticle oscillations. Structures
in time-like proton form factor, have also been recently
pointed out [1].

The content of the present work is diﬀerent. We ana-
lyze bare data of particle masses and widths and study
the mass variation versus the mass increase for adja-
cent meson and baryon masses of a family (nucleon, pi-
ons...and their excitations). We calculate the variation

∗ tati@ipno.in2p3.fr

m(n+1) − mn = f [(m(n+1) + mn)/2]

(1)

where m(n+1) corresponds to the (n+1) hadron mass
value. The diﬀerence of two successive masses is plotted
versus the mean value of the two nearby masses. Such
studies can only be illustrated for families holding sev-
eral, at least ﬁve, masses. The result of such variation is
shown in a selection of a few ﬁgures concerning mesons
and baryons. Even though there is no similar equation
(like Schrodinger) connecting the masses and widths, the
widths are also plotted in order to look at possible regular
oscillations.

The obtained data are ﬁtted using a cosine function:

∆M = α0 + α1cos((M − M0)/M1)

(2)

where M0 /M1 is deﬁned within 2π. All coeﬃcients, and
masses used to draw the ﬁgures are in MeV units. The
quantitative informations are given in Table I presented
below. The oscillation periods are P = 2 πM1. Both α0
and α1 are adjusted on the extreme values on all ﬁgures.
Whereas smaller periods than those given in the table
may also reproduce the data, we show in the following ﬁg-
ures, the largest possible values. The masses and widths
are read from the Review of Particle Physics [2], taking
into account all the data reported, even if, in some cases,
omitted from the summary table.

A similar study was given in Figs.

6 and 7 of a
previous paper [3], and, in a work studying the relation
between mass ratios and fractal properties [4].

Fig. 1 shows the results for f0 and f2 light unﬂavoured
mesons. Inserts (a) and (b) show successively the mass
diﬀerence between successive masses, plotted versus both
corresponding mean masses.
Inserts (c) and (d) show
the total widths versus the corresponding masses. The
σ or f0(500) meson is broad and its mass (taken to ∆m
= 125 MeV), is badly determined. The reasonable ﬁt
allows to extrapolate to the masses of the next f0 not
extracted experimentally up to now. They are M ≈ 2670
and 2760 MeV. In the same way, the masses of the next
f2 mesons can be tentatively predicted to be: M ≈ 2380,
2450, and 2625 MeV.

X(4660) ??(1−−) ﬁts perfectly in this distribution, and is
therefore kept, assigning tentatively the quantum num-
bers: I G = 0−. The extrapolation allows to predict ten-
tatively the next corresponding masses: M ≈ 4805 and
5080 MeV. In the same way, the tentatively extrapolated
masses at the large mass side of insert (b), are: M ≈
11330 and 11560 MeV. In inserts (c) and (d), dashed
vertical lignes show the threshold of disintegration into
two charm(bottom) mesons, allowing substantially large
widths.
Fig.

3 shows the results for Ξ and ΞC baryons.
Whereas the ﬁts describe well the data obtained for the
ﬁrst masses, the agreement is not so good for larger
masses of Ξ in insert (a). The small uncertainties on
the widths of many Ξ and ΞC baryons, allow to observe
clear shapes for data and ﬁts.

FIG. 1. Color on line. Inserts (a) and (b) show successively
the mass diﬀerence between successive masses, plotted ver-
sus both corresponding mean masses for f0 and f2 light un-
ﬂavoured mesons. Inserts (c) and (d) show the total widths
versus the corresponding masses of the same mesons.

Fig. 2 shows the results for 0−(1−−) charmonium (c¯c)
and 0−(1−−) bottomonium (b¯b) mesons. The ﬁrst data
in inserts (a) and (b) do not follow the ﬁt. We are not
able to suggest any assumption for that. The absence of
a low mass 0−(1−−) state is not likely; a bad attribution
of parity (presently the attributed quantum numbers are
??(1+−)) for hC (1P ) and hB(1P ) ? These quantum num-
bers are not measured but are quark model predictions.

FIG. 2. Color on line. Inserts (a) and (b) show successively
the mass diﬀerence between successive masses, plotted versus
both corresponding mean masses for 0−(1−−) charmonium
(c¯c) and 0−(1−−) bottomonium (b¯b) mesons. Inserts (c) and
(d) show the total widths versus the corresponding masses of
the same mesons.

FIG. 3. Color on line. Inserts (a) and (b) show successively
the mass diﬀerence between successive masses, plotted ver-
sus both corresponding mean masses for Ξ and ΞC baryons.
Inserts (c) and (d) show the total widths versus the corre-
sponding masses of the same baryons.

A curious feature is that the extracted parameters are
also showing regular oscillations. Fig. 4 shows, respec-
tively in inserts (a), (b), and (c) the mass oscillation pe-
riods, the width oscillation periods and the ratio of mass
over width periods, plotted versus the lower mass of each
family. Full red circles (blue squares) show the results
for mesons (baryons) illustrated above, empty circles and
squares correspond to data not illustrated before. We ob-
serve again oscillating shapes. Although we do not have,
presently, any motivation to justify the need for observ-
ing oscillations in the mass periods, neither in the width
periods, nor in the mass over width ratio periods, Fig. 4
shows that this is however the case. The empty marks
correspond to the same analysis performed on charmed
(D) and strange charmed (DS) mesons, as well as the
same analysis on N ∗ and ΛC baryons, not shown here.
These data as well as several others, will be published in
a forthcoming paper. The same period P= 829 MeV is

observed in inserts (a) and (c). The period of the width
period is two times smaller P=415 MeV, otherwise the
baryon data, mainly the ﬁrst one, is badly ﬁtted in insert
(b).

In conclusion, the paper shows that regular oscilla-
tions are often observed in hadron observables. The same
variation of the periods is observed from the analysis of
masses and widths of diﬀerent meson and baryon fam-
ilies. Such behavior requires the need for a theoretical
study to describe the observed oscillating distributions.
