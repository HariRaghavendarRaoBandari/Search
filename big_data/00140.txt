We search for low-dimensional chaotic signatures in the optical lightcurve of the Kepler
ﬁeld blazar W2R 1926+42. The frequently used correlation integral method is employed
in our analysis. We ﬁnd no apparent evidence for the presence of low-dimensional chaos
in the lightcurve. If further conﬁrmed, these results could be of importance for modeling
the blazar emission mechanisms.

1. Introduction

Blazars are jet-dominated, highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs), powered
by accretion and particle acceleration processes in the vicinity of a supermassive
black hole. To be considered as a blazar, these objects should have their jets closely
aligned with the line of sight. This perspective provides a unique opportunity to
study in detail the physical processes within the jet, which is of signiﬁcant impor-
tance not only for the astrophysics but also for the particle physics, as the energies
reached within the jets exceed signiﬁcantly those of the man-made accelerators.
However, the launching/emission mechanism of blazars is still not completely un-
derstood.

In order to understand blazar, it is important to probe underlying accretion disk
around the black hole, as the jet is launched from the disk which is inﬂuenced by the
black hole. However, the combined accretion-jet systems are nonlinear magnetohy-
drodynamical ﬂows, which can be described, in general, by 10 coupled diﬀerential
equations: 3 momentum balance, 3 induction, 2 energy conservation, 1 mass con-
servation, 1 for no monopole. Naturally, a question arises, whether the underlying
nonlinear system is chaotic or stochastic.
If it exhibits a low-dimensional chaos,
then eﬀectively a small number of independent variables are expected to control
the system. Hence, a model based on “single engine” may be a perfect choice.
Otherwise, the models based on the idea of many independent zones are the likely
scenario.

The set of hydrodynamic equations describing one-temperature accretion-
outﬂow systems was given by Ghosh and Mukhopadhyay 1 and how it is to be mod-
iﬁed in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld in two-temperature ﬂows can be understood
from the works by Mukhopadhyay and Chatterjee 2 and Rajesh and Mukhopad-

hyay 3. As mentioned above, it forms altogether a set of 10 equations and, hence, de-
scribing the evolution of 10 variables: 3 velocity components, 3 magnetic ﬁeld com-
ponents, ion and electron temperatures, pressure and density. These 10 variables,
in general, are expected to drive the entire observational appearance of the system,
including its continuum variability. However, if the system is a low-dimensional (e.g.
≤ 4) chaos, then all 10 variables eﬀectively need not be independent to each other.
Based on the Keplar ﬁeld data, here essentially we plan to explore the eﬀective
number of degrees of freedom determining the accretion-outﬂow system of blazars.
This is will direct for correct modeling of blazars and, in general, accretion-outﬂow
systems.

In the present work, we apply the correlation/fractal dimension method to the
optical lightcurve of a Kepler ﬁeld blazar W2R 1926+42, in order to ﬁnd the
number of the independent variables, driving the ﬂow. The results might prove to
be immensely helpful for the detailed modelling of the black hole accretion/jet ﬂow.

2. Computing correlation dimension

We follow Grassberger and Procaccia 4 and Karak, Dutta and Mukhopadhyay 5 to
apply correlation/fractal integral (CI) method, which is a statistical index mea-
suring change in details of a system with the change in scale. The method is a
suitable approach to reveal low-dimensional chaotic behavior in equally spaced ex-
perimental data sets (time series), such like blazar lightcurves 6. The method was
already applied for X-ray binaries: GRS 1915+105 (black hole), Sco X-1 (neutron
star) etc. earlier. It is known that the transient source GRS 1915+105 exhibits 12
diﬀerent temporal classes 7. We explored the underlying nonlinear features, based
on CI method, in all 12 classes and found that some of them are chaotic and some
other stochastic 8,9. Furthermore, Sco X-1 was shown to be chaotic 5 and ﬁnally by
comparing nonlinear behaviors between black hole and neutron star sources, we ar-
gued heuristically that Cyg X-3 is a black hole (whose nature is not quite conﬁrmed
yet).

The CI method is described in detail in the literature (see, e.g., Refs. 10, 11) and
relies on the construction of a new (empirical) phase space of embedding dimension
M from the available discrete data points. The data set (e.g. the lightcurve) is
separated into segments of length M . Each segment can be considered as an M -
dimensional vector (Xi). Then the CI, expressed as

CM (r) =

1

N (Nc − 1)

N

X

N

X

i=1

j=1,j6=i

Θ(r − |xi − xj |),

is a measure of how the number of points in this M -dimensional space changes
with the distance between any two them for each M . If the embedding dimension
M is larger than the eﬀective number of degrees of freedom, i.e. the correlation
dimension D2 (which is basically the slop of CM (r) − r curves, as described be-
low) of the dynamical system (the attractor), then saturation will occur, just like

the number of random points on a ﬂat surface will not grow faster than r2, even
though that from these points one can construct vectors of larger dimensions. The
attractor/correlation dimension is then

D2(M ) =

d log CM (r)

d log r

.

When applied to the famous Lorenz attractor

dx
dt

= σ(y − x),

dy
dt

= x(ρ − z) − y,

dz
dt

= xy − βz,

where see Ref. 12 for symbols and other details, the CI method correctly computes
the attractor dimension D2 as about 2.04. The ﬁrst integer number larger than the
attractor dimension is the number of the independent variables (equations) driving
the system (i.e. 3 in the case of Lorenz, as expected).

A limitation to the CI method is the presence of periodic signals in the data set.
Therefore it is always advisable to test as well surrogate data, produced from the
original data set after phase randomization, thus preserving the original power spec-
trum and distribution. If the low-dimensional signature of CI is not destroyed after
phase randomization, then it most probably is an artefact of the speciﬁc features
of the power spectrum of the original data set. The presence of additional noise
in the data can also conceal the low-dimensional attractor if such were present 10.
Figure 1 shows that CIs of Lorenz data saturate with increasing M , while there is
no saturation for its surrogate and random data, depicting how the ideal chaotic
system should behave.

3. Correlation dimension of the Kepler lightcurve of the blazar

W2R 1926+42

We choose the Kepler ﬁeld blazar due to the unprecedented high cadence, equal
spacing and high photometric accuracy (rms of about 0.002) of the Kepler satellite
lightcurve data sets. The blazar was monitored in unﬁltered optical light (which
is where presumably the maximum of the synchrotron emission of the blazar is)
for about 1.6 years, with time resolution of about 30 min. Figure 2 presents the
entire lightcurve, publicly available from the Kepler archive (details are in Bachev,
Mukhopadhyay and Strigachev 11).

Since the entire lightcurve of the blazar W2R 1926+42 consists of several seg-
ments with signiﬁcant time gaps in between, we test each segment separately. The
CI method has been applied to the surrogates of each segment as well. Figure 3
shows some of our results.

Although the pattern does not resemble the one of the pure random noise, we
can not ﬁnd any evidence for saturation (e.g. the presence of a low-dimensional
attractor) in any of the segments for the ﬁrst 10 embedding dimensions. Therefore,
we ﬁnd no signature of low-dimensional (e.g. 3 − 5) attractor, which could have
been useful to constrain/develop the theory. In addition, the surrogates show very

randomized surrogate. None of the diagrams shows clear indication for a strange attractor (chaos)

the ones of the real data 11.

similar patterns. The results, however, are somewhat similar to those reported by
Lehto et al. 10 for their shot-noise model, even though they studied diﬀerent type of
objects and energy bands.

4. Possible implications for the blazar jet models

If further conﬁrmed, our results (i.e. there is no low-dimensional behavior in the
blazar lightcurves W2R 1926+42) indicate that the often invoked one-zone model
may not correctly describe the blazar emission. The idea that synchrotron emission
from a single emitting region and its temporal evolution should be controlled by a
relatively small number of parameters, as the electron density distribution, magnetic
ﬁeld, Doppler factor, etc., cannot be conﬁrmed by our analysis. Perhaps there
are several, independently emitting/evolving regions that contribute to the blazar
emission and thus the number of the governing variables can not be small.

5. Summary

Our analysis of a very long, well sampled lightcurve of the blazar W2R 1926+42 from
the ﬁeld of the Kepler satellite reveals no apparent signatures of low-dimensional
chaotic behavior. These results, if further conﬁrmed for this and other similar
objects, suggest that perhaps the single zone models, often invoked to account for
the blazar emissions could be oversimpliﬁcation. Assuming the presence of many
independently emitting regions, each evolving separately, is probably the correct
approach to model the blazar spectral energy distribution and its temporal behavior.
