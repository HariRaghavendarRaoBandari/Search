TONGLIANG ZHANG, DEREN LUO, AND LIJING ZHENG∗

Abstract. Let Γn be the cone of an (n − 1)-complete algebra over an al-
gebraically closed ﬁeld k. In this paper, we prove that if the bound quiver
(Qn, ρn) of Γn is a truncation from the bound McKay quiver (QG, ρG) of a
ﬁnite subgroup G of GL(n, k), the bound quiver (Qn+1, ρn+1) of Γn+1, the
cone of Γn, is a truncation from the bound McKay quiver (Q eG, ρ eG) of eG, where
eG ∼= G × Zm for some m ∈ N.

Recently, Iyama introduced n-cluster tilting subcategories and developed higher
Auslander-Reiten theory ([12]). In [10], he introduced and characterized a class of
higher representation algebras, n-complete algebras. Such algebras are preserved
under cone constructions. He also proved that n-Auslander absolutely n-complete
algebra are constructed by iterative cone construction starting from some path
algebra of quiver of type Ar with linear orientation. Guo proved that such algebras
can be obtained from a truncation of the McKay quivers of some abelian groups
([5]).

In this paper, we generalize the results of Guo and prove the following result:
Let Γn be the cone of an (n − 1)-complete algebra, if the bound quiver (Qn, ρn)
of Γn is a truncation from the bound McKay quiver (QG, ρG) of a ﬁnite subgroup
G of GL(n, k), then there exists a positve integer m such that the bound quiver
(Qn+1, ρn+1) of Γn+1 is a truncation from the bound McKay quiver (Q eG, ρ eG) of a

ﬁnite subgroup eG ∼= G × Zm in GL(n + 1, k).

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 1, we shall recall some basic
deﬁnitions and facts needed for n-complete algebras, McKay quivers and trivial
extensions of graded self-injective algebras. Then we describe the bound McKay
quivers using twisted trivial extensions in Section 2 and Section 3. Our main
theorem will be stated and proved in Section 4.

1.1. n-complete algebra. In [12], Iyama introduced and studied n-complete al-
gebra. Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra. Let τn = DTrΩn−1 be the n-
Auslander-Reiten translation, the subcategory M = Mn(DΛ) = add {τ i
n(DΛ)|i ≥
0} of mod Λ is called the τn-closure of DΛ. Let

I(M) = add DΛ,

P(M) = {X ∈ M | τnX = 0},

MP = {X ∈ M | X has no non-zero summands in P(M)},

MI = {X ∈ M | X has no non-zero summands in I(M)}.

Λ is called n-complete if the global dimension of Λ, gl.dimΛ ≤ n, and the following

conditions (1) − (3) are satisﬁed.

(1). There exists a tilting Λ-module T satisfying P(M) = add T ,
(2). M is an n-cluster titing subcategory of T ⊥ = {X ∈ M|Exti

Λ(T, X) = 0(0 <

i)},

(3). Exti

Λ(MP , Λ) = 0 for any 0 < i < n.

In this case, Γ := EndΛ(Lt≥0

τ t
n(DΛ)) is called the cone of Λ.

Let Λ be an n-complete algebra and M = Mn(DΛ) the τn-closure of DΛ, we
denote by JM the Jacobson radical of M([1]). Deﬁne quiver (Q0 = Q0(M), Q1 =
Q1(M)) and a map τn as follows:

(1). Q0 (respectively,QP and QI) is the set of indecomposable objects in M

(respectively, MP and MI ).

(2). For X, Y ∈Q0, put dXY = dim (JM(X, Y )/J 2

M(X, Y )) and draw dXY arrows

from X to Y .

(3). A map τn : QP → QI is given by τn : MP → MI.
(Q0, Q1, τn) is a weak translation quiver in the sense of [12] and is called the

Auslander-Reiten quiver of M.

Let Γn be the cone of an (n−1)-complete algebra Γn−1, and let (Qn,0, Qn,1, τn) be
the Auslander-Reiten quiver of Mn−1(DΓn−1). By Lemma 6.4 of [12], Γn is given
by the bound quiver (Qn, ρn), that is Γn ∼= kQ/(ρn) for some relation ρn. We say
that Γn is given by the bound quiver (Qn, ρn) with n-Auslander-Reiten translation
τn. The bound Auslander-Reiten quiver of Mn(DΓn) is (Qn+1, ρn+1, τn+1).

Iyama proved the following theorem which described the relationship between the
bound quivers of n-complete algebra Γn and its cone Γn+1 with Auslander-Reiten
translations ([12], Theorem 6.7).

Theorem 1.1. Let Γn be an n-complete algebra which is the cone of an (n −
1)-complete algebra Γn−1 and let (Qn, ρn) be the bound quiver of Γn−1 with n-
Auslander-Reiten translations τn. Then the bound Auslander-Reiten quiver (Qn+1, ρn+1)
with n-Auslander-Reiten translation τn+1 of Γn is given by the followings:

• The vertex set

Qn+1,0 = {(x, d)|x ∈ Qn,0, d ≥ 0, τ d

nx 6= 0},

with

Qn+1,P = {(x, d)|x ∈ Qn,0, τ d+1
Qn+1,I = {(x, 0)|x ∈ Qn,0}.

n x = 0}

• The arrow set Qn+1,1 consists of two types of arrows:

n-COMPLETE ALGEBRAS AND MCKAY QUIVERS

– The set of arrows of the ﬁrst type obtained from arrows in Qn,1:

{(α, d) : (x, d) → (y, d)|α : x → y ∈ Qn,1, and (x, d), (y, d) ∈ Qn+1,0}.

– The set of arrows of the second type obtained by the n-Auslander-

Reiten translation τn:

{(x, d)1 : (x, d) → (τnx, d − 1)|(x, d) ∈ Qn+1,0, d > 0}.

• The relation set

ρn+1 = {(r, d)|r ∈ ρn} ∪ {(α, d − 1)(x, d)1 − (τ −

n y, d)1(τ −

n α, d)

| α : τnx → y ∈ Qn,1, d > 0},

here (r, d) is deﬁned as follow:

(p, t) = (αl, t) · · · (α1, d) and if r =Pv hvpv for paths pv of QG and hv ∈ k,
write (r, d) =Pv hv(pv, d).

• The n + 1-Auslander-Reiten translation:

if p = αl · · · α1 is a path in QG, write

τn+1 : Qn+1,P → Qn+1,I ,

τn+1(x, d) = (x, d + 1).

1.2. McKay quiver. McKay quiver was introduced in 1980 by John McKay for
a ﬁnite subgroup of the general linear group. Let s be a positive integer and let
G ⊂ GL(s, k) = GL(V ) be a ﬁnite subgroup, here V is an s-dimensional vector
space over k. Let {Si|i = 1, 2, . . . , n} be a complete set of irreducible representations
of G over k. For each Si, decompose the tensor product V ⊗ Si as a direct sum of
irreducible representations, write

V ⊗ Si =Mj

ai,jSj,

i = 1, . . . , n,

here ai,jSj is a direct sum of ai,j copies of Sj. The McKay quiver Q = Q(G) of
G is deﬁned the quiver with the vertex set Q0(G) the set of (the indices of) the
isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of G, and there are ai,j arrows
from the vertex i to the vertex j in the arrow set Q1(G).

In [6], Guo and Mart´ınez-Villa proved the McKay quiver of G is the quiver of a
pair of skew group algebras k[V ]∗G and ∧V ∗G, where k[V ] and ∧V are respectively
the symmetric algebra and exterior algebra of the vector space V . Thus there is
idempotent e and ¯e in k[V ]∗G and ∧V ∗G respectively, such that their basic algebras
V (G) = ek[V ]∗Ge ≃ kQ(G)/(ρ(G)) and Λ(G) = ¯e∧V ∗G¯e ≃ kQ(G)/(θ(G)) for the
path algebra kQ(G) of Q(G) and for some relation sets ρ(G) and θ(G), respectively.
Since ∧V ∗ G is a self-injective algebra, we have a Nakayama translation ν on the
McKay quiver Q(G), induced by the Nakayama functor. We call the bound quiver
(Q0(G), Q1(G), ρ(G)) the bound quiver of G.

It follows from Theorem 2.1 of [6] that the basic algebras V (G) = V (G)0 +
V (G)1 + · · · of k[V ] ∗ G and the basic algebra Λ(G) = Λ(G)0 + Λ(G)1 + · · · + Λs of
∧V ∗ G are quadratic dual. They share the same quiver QG, and we have V (G)1 =
Λ(G)1 = kQG,1 is the space spanned by the arrows in QG. The arrows form a
basis of V (G)1 and dual basis of Λ(G)1 = Homk(V (G)1, k)op. That is, we have

α(α′) = (cid:26) 1 α = α′

0 α 6= α′

, when they are regarded as arrows taken from the quiver

of Λ(G) and from the quiver V (G), respectively. We have αβ(α′β′) = α(α′)β(β′)
in the space kQ2 of paths of length two. Then relation set θ(G) and ρ(G) span
orthogonal subspaces in kQ2.

ZHANG ET AL.

In [9], Guo found that a returning arrow appears from i to ν(i) at each vertex
i in the McKay quiver of G when embedding GL(V ) to SL(V ′) for some s + 1-
dimensional space V ′ ⊃ V in some standard manner; and when embedding G into

a group eG in GL(V ′) such that G = eG ∩ SL(V ′) and eG/G is a cyclic group of order
m, the McKay quiver of eG is m copies of the McKay quiver of G connected by

the arrows induced by the returning arrows. Our main theorem is motivated from
this construction of McKay quivers. We will use trivial extension of self-injective
algebras and quadratic duality to give a concrete description of the bound McKay

quiver of eG.

1.3. Returning arrows for the trivial extensions. Recall that the trivial ex-
tension Λ ⋉ M of an algebra Λ by a Λ-Λ-bimodule M is the algebra deﬁned on the
vector space Λ ⊕ M with the multiplication deﬁned by

(a, x)(b, y) = (ab, ay + xb)

for a, b ∈ Λ and x, y ∈ M .

Let M be a right Λ-module and let σ ∈ Aut(Λ). By M σ we denote the right Λ-
module such that M σ = M as k-vector space and the right operation of an element
a of Λ on M σ is deﬁned by ma = mσ(a), for m ∈ M. Similarly, σN is deﬁned for
a left Λ-module N and an element σ ∈ Aut(Λ).

Let σ ∈ Aut(Λ). Denote by D(Λσ) the dual Λ-bimodule of Λσ, and the corre-
sponding trivial extension T (Λσ) = Λ⋉D(Λσ) is called the twisted trivial extension
algebra of Λ.

Fix an integer l ≥ 1, recall that the bound quiver Q of a graded self-injective
algebra Λ of Loewy length l + 1 is a stable translation quiver of Loewy length l + 1
satisfying the following conditions[4]:

(1). A permutation ν is deﬁned on the vertex set of Q;
(2). The maximal bound paths of Q have the same length l;
(3). For each vertex i, there is a maximal bound path from ν(i) to i, and there

is no bound path of length l from ν(i) to j for any j 6= i;

(4). Any two maximal bound paths starting at the same vertex are linearly

dependent.

ν is called the Nakayama translation of the stable translation quiver Q, it is

induced by the Nakayama functor.

Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional graded self-injective algebra given by a stable
translation quiver (Q, ρ) of Loewy length l+1 with the Nakayama translation ν. By

can be extended to a graded automorphism on Λ. Actually, ν is the Nakayama
automorphism of Λ induced by Nakayama functor on modΛ. The following quiver

[8], there is a map ν from Q1 to Si,j ejΛ1ei such that ν(Q1) is a basis of Λ1 which
eQ = (eQ0, eQ1) is called the returning arrow quiver of (Q, ρ)[8], where the vertex set
eQ0 = Q0, the arrow set eQ1 = Q1 ∪ {αi : i → ν(i) | i ∈ Q0};

Recall that an automorphism σ is called nice if it preserves idempotents, that

is, σ(e) = e for all the idempotents of Λ. The following theorem is proved in [8].

Theorem 1.2. Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional graded self-injective algebra given by a
stable translation quiver (Q, ρ) of Loewy length l + 1 with the Nakayama translation
ν. If σ is a nice graded automorphism of Λ, then the twisted trivial extension T (Λσ)

is given by the bound quiver (eQ,eρσ), where eρσ = ρ ∪ {ανiαi | i ∈ Q0} ∪ {αjβ −

σ−1ν(β)αi | β : i → j ∈ Q1}.

Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of Autk(Λ), and let Λ ∗ G be the skew group algebra
of Λ, assume that σ ∈ Autk(Λ) satisfying gσ = σg for g ∈ G, then σ induces a

automorphism eσ of Λ ∗ G such that eσ(a ∗ g) = σ(a) ∗ g for a ∈ Λ, g ∈ G. We

deﬁne g(a, ϕ) = (g(a), ϕg−1) for (a, ϕ) ∈ T (Λσ). Since gσ = σg, g can be lifted a
automorphism of T (Λσ). So G is a ﬁnite subgroup of Autk(T (Λσ)) and T (Λσ) ∗ G
makes sense.

Lemma 1.3. ([16, Lemma 2.2]) Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra, G a ﬁnite
subgroup of Autk(Λ), assume that σ ∈ Autk(Λ) satisfying gσ = σg for each g ∈ G.
Then we have a k-algebra isomorphism.

T (Λσ) ∗ G ∼= T ((Λ ∗ G)eσ).

Remark 1.4. By the proof of Theorem 2.3 in [8], we know that the twisted trivial

extension T (Λσ) can also be given by (eQ,bθσ), where

bθσ = ρ ∪ {ατ iαi | i ∈ Q0} ∪ {βατ −1(i) − ατ −1(j)ν−1σ(β) | β : i → j ∈ Q1}.

2. The bound McKay Quiver with Returning Arrows

Let V be an s-dimensional vector space over k, and let V ′ be an s+1-dimensional
vector space containing V . Let G ⊂ GL(V ) be a ﬁnite subgroup. GL(V ) ⊂ SL(V ′)

via the natural embedding g → (cid:18) g

det −1g (cid:19), where det is the determinant

map. Let G′ be the image of G. The McKay quiver Q(G′) is obtained from Q(G)
by inserting an arrow β : νi → i for each vertex i in Q(G)

Let Λ(G) and Λ′(G) be the basic versions of the skew group algebras ∧V ∗ G
and ∧V ′ ∗ G′. We ﬁrst study the bound quiver of Λ′(G) using trivial extension of
graded self-injective algebras.

We need a lemma comparing certain twisted trivial extensions of a graded algebra
with its basic algebra. Let A = A0 + A1 + · · · + Al be a ﬁnite dimensional graded
algebra such that A0 is semi-simple and A is generated by A0 and A1. Let B =
B0 + B1 + · · · + Bl be a basic version of A, that is, B is a basic algebra Morita
equivalent to A. Then B0 is a direct sum of ﬁnite copies of k, and generated by B0
and B1.

Let σ0 be the graded automorphism of A induced by the map

σ0 : γ 7→ (−1)nγ

on A1. Then σ0 induces an automorphism of B, which we also denote by σ0.

Lemma 2.1. T (Aσ0 ) and T (Bσ0 ) are Morita equivalent.

Proof. Take e ∈ A0 to be an idempotent such that B = eAe is the basic algebra
of A, it follows from Corollary 6.10 of [1] that F = Hom(Ae, −) : modA → modB
is an equivalence of categories. Then by Theorem 6.8 of [15], there is a projective
generator BP = F (A) = eA such that EndB(P ) ∼= A as k-algebras. Clearly P is a
graded B-A-bimodule. By [2] there are integers m, n and modules B′, P ′ with the
following left B-module isomorphisms

P n ∼= B ⊕ B′, Bm ∼= P ⊕ P ′.

Thus we have the left T (Bσ0 )-module isomorphisms

(T (Bσ0) ⊗B P )n ∼= T (Bσ0 ) ⊕ (T (Bσ0) ⊗B B′)

6

and

ZHANG ET AL.

(T (Bσ0))n ∼= (T (Bσ0 ) ⊗B P ) ⊕ ((T (Bσ0 ) ⊗B P ′)).

Thus T (Bσ0) ⊗B P is a projective generator of mod T (Bσ0), write it as eP .

By Proposition 1.8 and the claim above Proposition 1.13 of [3], we have

EndT (Bσ0 )(eP ) ∼= EndB(P ) ⋉ HomB(P, D(Bσ0 ) ⊗ P ).

It follows from Lemma 5 of [11] that

AD(A)A ∼=A HomB(BPA,B D(B) ⊗B PA)A.

Observe that

Deﬁne

AD(Aσ0 )A ∼=A HomB(BP σ0

A ,B D(B) ⊗B PA)A.

π :A HomB(BP σ0

A ,B D(B)A ⊗B PA)A →A HomB(BPA,B D(Bσ0 ) ⊗B PA)A

by π(f )(p) = Pi(−1)if (pi), for f ∈A HomB(BP σ0
p =Pi pi with pi ∈ Pi.

A ,B D(B)A ⊗B PA)A, p ∈ P ,

Then π is an A-A-bimodule isomorphism.
Thus we have an algebra isomorphism T (Aσ0 ) ∼= EndB(P ) ⋉ HomB(P, D(Bσ0 ) ⊗
(cid:3)

P ). By Theorem 6.7 of [15], T (Aσ0 ) and T (Bσ0 ) are Morita equivalent.

Let ε be a graded automorphism of ∧V induced by the linear map

ε : x 7→ −x

on the vector space V .

By Proposition 3.1 of [15], the Nakayama automorphism ν of ∧V is induced by
the linear map deﬁned by ν(x) = (−1)n−1x for x ∈ V . Let σ = εν, then σ is a
graded automorphism of ∧V . For g = (rij )n×n ∈ G, we have

σg(xi) = gσ(xi) = (−1)n

nXj=1

rij xj,

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Therefore σg = gσ on ∧V . By the argument above Lemma 1.3, G can
be regarded as an automorphism group of T (∧V σ) and σ induces an automorphism

eσ on ∧V ∗ G such that
for p ∈ (∧V )0 = k, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and hence eσ is a nice automorphism of ∧V ∗ G.

eσ(xi ∗ g) = σ(xi) ∗ g = (−1)n(xi ∗ g), eσ(p ∗ g) = σ(p) ∗ g = p ∗ g

We have the following proposition.

Proposition 2.2. ∧V ′ ∗ G′ ∼= T ((∧V ∗ G)˜σ) as algebras.

Proof. Note that D(∧V ) is generated by (∧V )∗
n = D((∧V )n) as ∧V -∧V -bimodule,
n. As an algebra, T (∧V σ) is generated by (∧V )0
and assume that 0 6= ϕ ∈ (∧V )∗
n, with the additional relation ϕ2 = 0 and ϕx + xϕ = 0, by
and (∧V )1 + (∧V )∗
Proposition 2.5 of [8]. This shows T (∧V σ) ≃ ∧V ′ and T (∧V σ) ∗ G ≃ ∧V ′ ∗ G′. So
we get ∧V ′ ∗ G′ ∼= T ((∧V ∗ G)eσ) by Lemma 1.3.
(cid:3)

The following proposition recovers and generalizes Theorem 3.1 of [9].

Proposition 2.3. Suppose that (QG, θG) is the bound quiver of Λ(G), and let ν be
the Nakayama automorphism on Λ(G). The bound quiver (QG′, θG′) of ∧V ′ ∗ G′ is
given by the followings:

1. QG′ is obtained from QG by adding an arrow βi : i → νi for each vertex

i ∈ QG,0.

2. θG′ = θG ∪ {βνiβi | i ∈ QG,0} ∪ {αβν−1i − βν−1jν−1eσ(α) | α : i → j ∈ QG,1}.

Proof. By Proposition 2.2, ∧V ′ ∗ G′ ∼= T ((∧V ∗ G)eσ). By Lemma 2.1, we have that
T (Λ(G)eσ) is the basic algebra of T ((∧V ∗ G)eσ), and T (Λ(G)eσ) ∼= kQG′/(θG′). Λ(G)
is a ﬁnite dimensional graded self-injective algebra with stable translation quiver
(QG, θ) with the Nakayama translation induces by ν. So by Theorem 1.2, we get
that QG′ is obtained from QG by adding an arrow βi : i → ν(j) for each vertex
i ∈ QG,0, and by Theorem 1.2 and Remark 1.4,

θG′ = θG ∪ {βνiβi | i ∈ QG,0} ∪ {αβν−1i − βν−1jν−1eσ(α) | α : i → j ∈ QG,1}.

(cid:3)

Furthermore, we have the following proposition on the bound McKay quiver.

Proposition 2.4. Let (QG, θG) be the bound quiver of ∧V ∗ G, then the relation
set of the bound McKay quiver (QG′, ρG′) of G′ is given by

ρG′ = ρG ∪ {αβν−1(i) − βν−1(j)ν−1(α) | α : i → j ∈ QG,1}.

Proof. Let QG,2 and QG′,2 be the sets of the paths of length 2 of QG and of QG′.
respectively. Since QG,1 is a subset of QG′,1, we have ρ(G) ⊂ ρ(G′), θ(G) ⊂ θ(G′)
and kQG,2 ⊂ kQG′,2. Since V (G) and Λ(G) are quadratic dual, and V (G) and
Λ(G) are quadratic dual, ρ(G) and θ(G) span orthogonal subspaces in kQG,2, and
ρ(G′) and θ(G′) span orthogonal subspaces in kQG′,2. For each pair i, j of vertices,
the subsets ejθij (G)ei and ejρ(G)ei span of orthogonal subspaces in ejkQG,2ei, and
the subsets ejθij(G′)ei and ejρ(G′)ei span of orthogonal subspaces in ejkQG′,2ei.

Fix a vertex i, the set the paths of length 2 from i to j of QG′ is

ejQG′,2ei = ejQG,2ei ∪ {βνiβi} ∪ {βν−1jα, ν(α)′βi|α ∈ eν−1jQ1ei}

if j = ν2(i), and is

ejQG′,2ei = ejQG,2ei ∪ {βν(i)βi} ∪ {βν−1(j)α, ν(α)′βi|α ∈ eν−1(j)Q1ei}

if j 6= ν2(i). Thus ejρ(G′)ei span an orthogonal subspace of ejθ(G′)ei since

(αβν−1(i) − βν−1(j)ν−1eσ(α))(αβν−1(i) + βν−1(j)ν−1eσ(α))
= α(α)βν−1(i)(βν−1(i)) − βν−1(j)(βν−1(j))ν−1eσ(α)(ν−1eσ(α))

= 0

.

Since eσ(α) = −α for all α ∈ QG,1, this shows that

ρG′ = ρG ∪ {αβν−1(i) − βν−1jν−1α | α : i → j ∈ QG,1}

is the relation set for V (G′).

3. Bound McKay Quivers for Cyclic Extension

By embedding GL(V ) into SL(V ′), we obtain returning arrows in the McKay
quiver of a group. We need smash product construction for the algebra to change the
returning arrows into connecting arrows between the copies of the original McKay
quiver. These connecting arrows are the arrows of type (x, d)1 : (x, d) → (τnx, d−1)
in the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the cone (Theorem 1.1). Such construction is
realized by a direct product of group G′ with a cyclic group. Let H be a ﬁnite
group, and let Λ be an H-graded algebra. Recall that the smash product Λ#kH ∗
is the free Λ-module with basis H ∗ = {δg | g ∈ H}, and the multiplication is deﬁned
by

aδg · bδh = abgh−1 δh,

for a, b ∈ Λ, where bgh−1 is the homogeneous component of degree gh−1 of b in Λ.

Let ξm ∈ k be a primitive m-th root of unity and let

ωm =

1

. . .





(s+1)×(s+1)

ξm

Let Cm = (ξm) be the cyclic subgroup of GL(V ′) generated by ωm and let eG =
GCm = G × Cm, then eG ∩ SL(V ′) = G. Let dCm = Hom(Cm, k∗) ∼= Zm be the dual
1 and dCm

group of Cm. For λi ∈ Hom(Cm, k∗) such that λi(ωm) = ξi
is the cyclic group generated by λ1.

Let V ′ = V + V1 is a direct sum of subspaces, and V1 is an one dimensional
subspace of spanned by y. The action of Cm on V ′ induce a Cm-grading on ∧V ′ ∗G′
with such that a ∈ (∧V ′ ∗ G′)ωi if and only if ω(a) = ξia. Thus ∧V ′ ∗ G′ = (∧V ′ ∗
G′)ω0 + (∧V ′ ∗ G′)ω1 , with (∧V ′ ∗ G′)ω0 = ∧V ∗ G′ and (∧V ′ ∗ G′)ω1 = y(∧V ∗ G′),
is a Cm-graded algebra. Now it follows from [14] that

m, then λi = λi

∧V ′ ∗ eG ∼= ∧V ′ ∗ (G′ × Cm) ∼= (∧V ′ ∗ G′) ∗ Cm,

∗

.

and by [13], (∧V ′ ∗ G′) ∗ Cm ∼= (∧V ′ ∗ G′)#kdCm
is a primitive idempotent of (∧V ′ ∗ G′)#kdCm

Clearly, if ei is a primitive idempotent of ∧V ′ ∗ G′, then for each j ∈ Z/mZ, eiδj

4. Main theorems

In this section we shall prove our main theorem.
Let (Q, ρ) be a bound quiver and let Q′ be a full bound subquiver of Q in the
sense that the arrows from i to j in Q′ are the same as in Q provided that both

paths in Q and hv ∈ k. Let J ′

i, j are vertices in Q′. For each element a = Pv∈Ja hvpv ∈ kQ, where pv are
write aQ′ = Pv∈J ′

a = {v ∈ Ja|the vertices of pv are all in Q′} and
hvpv. We say that aQ′ is the component of a in Q′. For each
a, we have that pv passes through a vertex outside Q′, thus we have
v for iv in Q0 \ Q′
0 in kQ. Let ρ′ = {aQ′|a ∈ ρ} be the relation set on

v ∈ Ja \ J ′
pv = qveiv q′
Q′ induced by ρ and call (Q′, ρ′) a full bound subquiver of (Q, ρ).

a

Let Q′ and Q′′ be ﬁnite quivers, write s, t for the maps from the arrow set
to the vertex set sending an arrow to its source and its target, respectively. So
we have α : s(α) → t(α) for an arrow α. A pair of maps ω = (ω0, ω1), where
ω0 : Q′
if it satisﬁes the
following conditions:

0 , ω1 : Q′

0 → Q′′

1 → Q′′

(i). sω1(α) = ω0s(α), tω1(α) = ω0t(α) for α ∈ Q′
1.
(ii). ω0 and ω1 are injections.
In this case, we write ω(Q′) ⊆ Q′′.
Obviously, ω induces a algebra monomorphism ω : kQ′ → kQ.
Let (Q′, ρ′) , (Q, ρ) be bound quivers, and ω an algebra monomorphism ω :

kQ′ → kQ, write ω(ρ′) = {ω(x)|x ∈ ρ′}. We introduce the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 4.1. The bound quiver (Q′, ρ′) is said to be a truncation from the
bound quiver (Q, ρ), if there is a quiver embedding ω : Q′ → Q satisfying that ω(ρ′)
is induced by ρ.

In this case, the quiver embedding ω is called a bound quiver truncation of
(Q′, ρ′) from (Q, ρ), and the algebra Λ′ = kQ′/(ρ′) is called a truncation of the
algebra Λ = kQ/(ρ).

We have the following proposition.

Proposition 4.2. Let Λ′ and Λ be algebras over k given by the bound quivers
(Q′, ρ′) and (Q, ρ), respectively. If Λ′ is a truncation of Λ, there is a subset E of
the orthogona primitive idempotents of Λ such that Λ′ ∼= Λ/(E), where (E) is the
ideal generated by E.

Proof. Since Λ′ is a truncation of Λ, (Q′, ρ′) is a truncation from (Q, ρ), induced by

that is, the set of trivial paths in kQ which induce primitive idempotents in Λ. Then

some quiver embedding ω and Λ′ = kQ′/(ρ′). Let eE be the preimage of E in kQ,
we have an isomorphism kQ/(eE) ≃ kQ′, write φ : kQ → kQ′ for the homomorphism
which induces the isomorphism, then Ker φ = (eE). Let π′ : kQ′ → Λ′ be the

canonical homomorphism, then π′φ : kQ → Λ′ is an epimorphism and we have that
Ker π′φ is generated by E ∪ ω(ρ′), that is. Ker π′φ = (E, ω(ρ′)) = (E, {aω(Q′)|a ∈
ρ}) = (E, ρ), since qeiq′ in (E) if i ∈ E. In particular, (ρ) ⊂ Ker πφ and the map

π′φ = ψπ factor through the canonical homomorphism π : kQ → kQ/(ρ) = Λ. Thus

ψ : Λ → Λ′ is an epimorphism and Ker ψ = π(eE) = (E). That is Λ′ ∼= Λ/(E). (cid:3)

Let Γ(n) be an n-complete algebra over k which is the cone of an n − 1-complete
algebra and let (Qn, ρn) be its bound quiver with n-Auslander-Reiten translation
τn. Let G ⊂ GL(n, k) be a ﬁnite subgroup and let (QG, ρG) the McKay quiver of
G with the Nakayama translation νG. We say that the bound quiver of Γ(n) is a
truncation of the bound McKay quiver of G if there is a truncation ω(n) of (Qn, ρn)
from (QG, ρG) such that

0 τn = νGω(n)

Now we state and prove our main theorem.

Theorem 4.3. Let Γ(n) be an n-complete algebra over k which is the cone of an
n − 1-complete algebra and let Γ(n+1) be the cone of Γ(n). Assume that there is a
ﬁnite subgroup G ⊂ GL(n, k) such that the bound quiver of Γ(n) is a truncation of
the McKay quiver of G.

Then there is m, and a ﬁnite subgroup eG of GL(n + 1, k) such that the bound
quiver of Γ(n+1) is a truncation of the McKay quiver of eG.

Proof. Let (Qn, ρn) and (Qn+1, ρn+1) be the bound quiver of Γ(n) and Γ(n+1), re-
spectively. Then (Qn+1, ρn+1) is constructed from (Qn, ρn) by Iyama as in Theorem
1.1.

Let m be a suﬃcient large integer such that τ m

n i = 0 for all vertex x ∈ Qn,0. Let
G′ be the subgroup of SL(n + 1, k) which is the image of G under the canonical

det −1(g) (cid:19), and let Cm be the subgroup of GL(n + 1, k)

Let eG = G′ × Cm be a ﬁnite subgroup of GL(n + 1, k). The bound McKay quiver
of eG is given in Corollary 3.4.
Now we deﬁne a quiver embedding eω = (eω0,eω1) from (Qn+1, ρn+1) to the bound
McKay quiver (Q eG, ρ eG): Deﬁne eω0 on the vertex set by
eω0(x, d) = (ω0(x), −d)

ω(Qn) of some relation ̺ ∈ ρG. Thus eω(r, d) = (ω(r), −d) is the component in

Zr1 }. We deﬁne the map: ς1 : As → QG1 as follows: ς1(i) = i, ς1(ai) = αi, for
i ∈ As,0, ai ∈ As,1. It’s straightforward to check that ς1 is a quiver homomorphism,
and observe that ρAs = ρG1 = ∅. Then As is a truncation of (QG1, ρG1) induced by
ς1, and ν1ς1(i) = i − 1 = ς1τ1(i), ν1ς1(ai) = αi−1 = ς1τ1(ai), for i ∈ As,0, ai ∈ As,1,
where ν1 is the Nakayama translation deﬁned on the McKay quiver QG1.

By Theorem 1.19 of [12], T n
