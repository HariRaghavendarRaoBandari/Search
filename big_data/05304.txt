Abstract – We re-investigate electroweak signal-background interference in associated Higgs pro-
duction via gluon fusion in the presence of new physics in the top-Higgs sector. Considering the
full ﬁnal state pp → b¯b(cid:96)+(cid:96)− ((cid:96) = e, µ), we discuss how new physics in the top-Higgs sector that
enhances the ZZ component can leave footprints in the HZ limit setting. In passing we investi-
gate the phenomenology of a class of new physics interactions that can be genuinely studied in
this process.

Introduction. – After the Higgs discovery in 2012
and initial property measurements [1, 2] in the so-called
κ framework, the phenomenology community has now
moved towards understanding constraints in the dimen-
sion six eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) extension of the Stan-
dard Model (SM), which provides a theoretically clean and
well-deﬁned approach to constrain the presence of new
physics interactions with minimal assumptions [3–7].

The ﬁeld of Standard Model EFT has seen a rapid devel-
opment recently. Not only have the run I measurements by
ATLAS and CMS been interpreted in terms of the dimen-
sion six EFT extension [8–26], but the EFT framework
has also been extended to next-to-leading order [27–35].
Measurement strategies that take into account these cor-
rections via renormalization group improved calculations
have been presented in [36, 37].

Due to the large number of eﬀective operators that are
relevant to Higgs physics, it becomes essential to collect
information from all possible processes related to Higgs
boson, especially at the LHC run II and the future high
luminosity phase. Since a single eﬀective operator can
contribute to diﬀerent processes, there are correlations
among them that can be used to ﬁnd bounds on the Wil-
son coeﬃcients of diﬀerent operators. Measurements of
associated Higgs production [20, 36, 38], Higgs+jet pro-
duction [39–45], top quark-associated production and the
recently developed Higgs oﬀ-shell measurements in gg →
ZZ [46–48] will be pivotal to obtain a ﬁne-grained pic-

ture of potential compatibility of the Higgs discovery with
the SM expectation. In particular, the latter production
mechanism has been motivated as an excellent candidate
to constrain new physics eﬀects by exploiting large mo-
mentum transfers to break degeneracies of new physics
interactions in the on-shell Higgs phenomenology [49–52].

Similarly, high momentum transfers in associated Higgs
production pp → HZ are sensitive probes of new inter-
actions [20, 53–55]. The reason is the existence of a de-
structive interference between the triangle and box con-
tributions in the SM that can be lifted by new or anoma-
lous couplings. Furthermore, the high momentum transfer
provides another avenue to discriminate the Higgs signal
from the background relying on jet substructure meth-
ods [56–60].

While jet-substructure analyses provide an extremely
versatile and adaptable tool in new physics and Higgs
searches, the mass resolution of Higgs decays H → b¯b in
such a search is a limiting factor. This becomes a chal-
lenge especially if cross sections or beyond the SM-induced
deviations thereof become small for large backgrounds.

It is known that gluon fusion-induced associated Higgs
production [61–63], while only contributing ∼ 10% of
the inclusive HZ production cross section [64–76], be-
comes relevant at large momentum transfers due to the
top quark threshold [53, 54]. A similar argument applies
to the non-decoupling of gg → H → ZZ at high mo-
mentum transfers [46, 47, 77]. Therefore the same type

of physics can enhance both pp → HZ and pp → ZZ.
We are therefore tempted to ask the following question:
when studying the full ﬁnal state pp → b¯b(cid:96)+(cid:96)− as signal
for pp → H(→ b¯b)Z(→ (cid:96)+(cid:96)) ∗ for kinematics that allow
the discovery of the Higgs boson in associated production,
how important is the irreducible pp → Z(→ b¯b)Z(→ (cid:96)+(cid:96))
background keeping in mind an imperfect H → b¯b resolu-
tion?
To answer this question we organise this letter as fol-
lows. First we introduce a minimal set of operators which
impact the two contributions pp → HZ and pp → ZZ in
a diﬀerent way, but necessarily related through gauge in-
variance. We then investigate the phenomenology of high
pT ﬁnal states at the parton level. Subsequently, we show
how our ﬁndings translate to the fully hadronized ﬁnal
state before we conclude.

New physics eﬀects in gluon initiated HZ pro-
duction. – Gluon-initiated associated production has
been shown to contribute signiﬁcantly to pp → HZ in the
boosted regime at the LHC and important consequences
for new physics searches can be obtained by looking at
this process [53, 54, 74]. New physics can potentially mod-
ify associated Higgs production both in the quark- and
gluon-initiated channels. The quark-initiated channel may
be altered at leading-order through modiﬁed Higgs cou-
plings [37] or at next to leading-order through the inﬂu-
ence of new particles or eﬀective operators in loops [54,78].
Similarly, the gluon-initiated channel may receive correc-
tions through modiﬁed Higgs and top couplings to SM
states.

In principle, all dimension six operators that are rele-
vant for the Higgs sector should be considered since at
∗The Higgs decay to leptons, i.e. pp → HH → b¯b(cid:96)+(cid:96)− is numer-

ically negligible.

the very least they can change the Higgs width, which af-
fects the full partonic ﬁnal state. However, several of these
operators are already constrained from other observable,
such as the Z-pole properties measured at LEP1. In order
to keep our discussion transparent, we will focus on only
two operators that are weakly constrained and are rele-
vant for Higgs production (we adopt the parameterisation
of [7, 79]):

physical Higgs Φ ⊃ H.

It aﬀects the Ztt coupling but not Htt and it introduces
a new ttHZ coupling. As required by gauge invariance,
the derivative coupling of the top quark to the neutral
Goldstone boson gets also shifted by the same quantity.
Couplings to left-handed quark doublets are constrained
by data on Z → b¯b) and will not change qualitative out-
come of our discussion.† Operators of this form but involv-
ing light fermions are constrained by precision electroweak

scenarios [80], which will also leave footprints in q ¯q → HZ as a
function of the ﬁne-tuning parameter v2/f 2, where f is the pion
decay constant analogue.

measurements |cHu| (cid:46) 2% and assuming a trivial ﬂavor

structure of the UV dynamics will directly constrain the
interaction of Eq. (1), which is otherwise unconstrained
by electroweak precision data and has no impact on Higgs
decays (see, e.g. [7] for a comprehensive discussion). We
will ignore this potential constraint for the time being, but
will come back to it later.

The operator Eq. (2) modiﬁes the top Yukawa coupling

by a factor proportional to Wilson coeﬃcient ¯ct

yt → yt(1 + ¯ct)

(4)

while leaving the top mass as in the SM with a simple re-
deﬁnition of the top quark ﬁeld. The non-derivative cou-
plings of the top quark to the neutral Goldstone boson are
unchanged.

We show in Fig. 1 the relevant Feynman diagrams for
pp → HZ and pp → ZZ ignoring the diagrams involving
the unphysical Goldstones. Notice in particular the new
eﬀective vertex ¯ttHZ introduced by operator Eq. (1), not
present in the SM, which gives rise to the Feynman dia-
gram contribution to the gluon-initiated amplitude shown
in Fig. 1 (a), and which may upset the cancellation be-
tween triangle and box diagrams for pp → HZ in the SM,
leading to an enhanced cross section. This cancellation is
also upset by the change in the top Yukawa coupling intro-
duced by operator Eq. (2). In fact, the eﬀect of a ﬂipped
top Yukawa coupling (i.e., with a coupling of opposite sign
with respect to the SM, corresponding to ¯ct = −2) on
pp → HZ was studied in [55].
Together these operators provide a parameterisation
that allow us to “template” the gg → ZZ and gg → HZ
components of the full partonic ﬁnal state pp → b¯bl+l− in
a gauge invariant fashion, and therefore gives us a well-
deﬁned approach to study the signal-background interfer-
ence in this ﬁnal state. Note that since these operators
only modify the ttH and ttZ couplings, they do not aﬀect

the tree-level q ¯q → HZ process. Only the operator Eq. (2)
changes the Higgs branching ratios (by a few percent in
the relevant BR(H → b¯b) in the cases explored here) and
it has been taken into account.
The new interactions arising from Eq. (1) and Eq. (2)
were implemented using FeynRules [81]. We calculate
the one-loop gluon-initiated gg → (HZ + ZZ) → b¯b(cid:96)+(cid:96)−
production amplitudes using the FeynArts, FormCalc
and LoopTools [82, 83] framework which we interface
with Vbfnlo [84] to perform the phase space integra-
tion and generate events in the Les Houches standard.
We pass these events to Herwig++ [85] for showering
and hadronization. The q ¯q-initiated process is simulated
with MadGraph5 [86] using an identical input parame-
ter setting and passed through Herwig++ to obtain the
full hadronic ﬁnal state. The respective samples are nor-
malised to the NLO QCD predictions of the SM [63, 64].
We use a K−factor of 1.2 and 1.8 for qq and gg-initiated
processes respectively.

Parton level analysis.

Before we analyse the full
hadron level, it is worthwhile to re-investigate the order
of magnitude of expected interference eﬀects between the
gg → HZ and gg → ZZ parts in the full pp → HZ + ZZ
ﬁnal state (see also [74] for an earlier discussion). To this
end, we show in Fig. 2 a parton level comparison of the in-
variant mass distribution between HZ and ZZ production
for gluon-initiated b¯b(cid:96)+(cid:96)− (in this case (cid:96) = µ) production.
Notice the rise of the cross section near the 2mt threshold.
Signal-background interference between the two contri-
butions is in general a small eﬀect and the relative size of
HZ dominates over ZZ as a consequence of the relative
branching ratio suppression of H → b¯b (60%) and Z → ¯bb
(15%). This is left unchanged for changes in ¯ct [74], how-
ever, there will be modiﬁcations from Eq. (2).

In order to obtain a ﬁrst estimate of the sensitivity to
the eﬀective operators, we consider ﬁrst the process pp →

As an example, we show in Fig. 3 the eﬀect of ¯cHt = 1.
One can see that this operator can dramatically impact
the boosted Higgs regime due to the lifting of the SM
cancellation and also the derivative nature of the induced
coupling.

In order to derive exclusion regions in the (¯ct, ¯cHt) plane
we perform a log-likelihood hypothesis test based on a
shape comparison of the pT (b¯b) distribution. We deﬁne the
log-likelihood ratio comparing the SM (null-)hypothesis
with the SM+new physics (NP) hypothesis [87, 88]

where Ni = σi(¯ct, ¯cHt)L is the number of expected events,
and ni the number of observed event in the bin i at a given
luminosity L. We use 50 bins of 20 GeV each, with 0 <
pT (b¯b) < 1000 GeV. We sample the two hypotheses with
pseudo-data distributed around the hypotheses, giving rise
to probability density functions F SM+NP(Q) and F SM(Q)
for the SM+NP and SM distributions, respectively.
Exclusion limits are expressed by computing the CLs

The parameter space region resulting from CLs < 0.05 is
considered excluded at the 95% conﬁdence level by con-
vention. For CLs < 0.05 the SM+NP false exclusion

where (cid:104)Q(cid:105)SM denotes the median of the null hypothesis
distribution. This amounts to a small “false exclusion”
(the type-II error) when this exclusion is possible in the
ﬁrst place (i.e. CLs is safe against downward ﬂuctuations).
In Fig. 4 we show the expected exclusion for a luminos-
ity of 100 fb−1 based on our parton level results. While
the resonant and continuum ZZ contributions are largely
suppressed, the gauge-invariant extension of the top loop-

induced gg → ZZ diagram‡ introduces the t¯tHZ interac-

tion. The result of Fig. 4 indicates that the modiﬁcation
according to operator Eq. (1), even for small choices in
agreement with precision analyses [7] can in principle im-
pact the limit setting procedure in associated Higgs pro-
duction through sculpting the pT (b¯b) distribution, espe-
cially when marginalising over Eq. (2) in a global ﬁt where
degenerate operator directions will inﬂuence the expected
exclusion.

Showering and hadronization. The results of the par-
ton analysis detailed in the previous section are known
to change substantially when we turn to the full hadron
level ﬁnal state and perform a realistic reconstruction [53].
Based on the event generation strategy outlined above, we
apply typical HZ ﬁnal state selection cuts by

(i) requiring exactly 2 oppositely charged same-ﬂavor

leptons satisfying |η(cid:96)| < 2.5, pT ((cid:96)) > 30 GeV,
boson mass: 80 GeV < m((cid:96)+(cid:96)−) < 100 GeV,

(ii) require that these leptons are compatible with the Z

(iii) and require boosted topologies pT ((cid:96)+(cid:96)−) > 200 GeV.

(iv) We then perform a typical BDRS analysis [56]: All
remaining hadronic activity is clustered using Fast-
Jet [90] into a Cambridge-Aachen fat jet with R =
1.2. The boosted Higgs candidate jet has to sat-
isfy pT,j > 200 GeV and at least one such object is
required in |η| < 2.5. The fat jet is ﬁltered, mass-
dropped and double b-tagged with a b-tag eﬃciency
of 60% (2% fake rate), yielding a total eﬃciency of
36%.

(v) Higgs candidates are required to be compatible with
110 GeV < m(b¯b) < 140 GeV evaluated on the b-
tagged subjets.

‡One can understand the modiﬁcation of the Zt¯t interaction as

replacing H → (cid:104)H(cid:105).

the fully hadronized ﬁnal state. While HZ + ZZ signal-
background interference is suppressed, new physics eﬀects
that impact pp → ZZ can also leave footprints in boosted
analyses pp → HZ through new interactions related by
gauge invariance. These eﬀects have not been considered
so far. However, a robust limit setting in this channel will
require a large luminosity. Even at these large luminosities
the constraints on ¯cHt will not be competitive with elec-
troweak precision constraints under the assumption of a
trivial ﬂavor structure (as commonly done in Higgs ﬁts at
this stage in the LHC phenomenology programme). Relax-
ing this assumption, associate Higgs production via gluon
fusion can act as a test of this hypothesis, especially when
other measurements point towards the SM.

integrated luminosity.

While the high-pT selection is enough to remove the
biggest background t¯t almost entirely, jet-substructure ap-
proaches remove the QCD-induced b¯b production modes
from the selection to a large extent, leaving Z+jet produc-
tion as a dominant background (or calibration tool). The
Higgs mass resolution quoted in (v) is a key factor in the
boosted analysis to allow signal vs. background extrac-
tion in the ﬁrst place (and veto SM q ¯q-induced ZZ pro-
duction). However as mentioned before the gluon-induced
ZZ contribution could in principle be enhanced through
the operator discussed previously, thus adding more sig-
niﬁcantly to the region (v) than expected in the SM and
at parton level due to shower and hadronization eﬀects.

After these analysis steps one typically obtains a cross
section of ∼ 0.2 fb for the SM which includes both q ¯q
and gg-initiated processes. And again we ﬁnd the impact
of HZ far more dominant than ZZ. As expected, the
lowered statistical yield when taking into account the full
reconstruction eﬃciencies requires a larger luminosity to
set limits. Following the prescription of Eq. (6)-(10) we
obtain a result comparable to the parton analysis of the
−1, see Fig. 5. This means that

measurements at this luminosity, which are expected to

limit |¯ct| (cid:46) 10−2 [26], the presence of ¯cHt for trivial ﬂavor

structures, i.e. at the level of ¯cHt = ¯cHu is diﬃcult to con-
strain and can practically be neglected when working with
this assumption. However, associated Higgs production
provides test of non-trivial beyond the SM ﬂavour struc-
tures, which can be combined with direct t¯tZ searches (see
e.g. [91–94]).
