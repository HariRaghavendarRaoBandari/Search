Introduction
Introduction

1
1.1
The hypothesis that critical two-dimensional lattice models should have con-
formally invariant scaling limits was formulated in the physics community in
the 1980s. Starting with [3] conformal ﬁeld theory was developed to exploit
conformal invariance and subsequently applied to many lattice models, pro-
ducing predictions of, e.g., critical exponents and correlation functions. The
Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) processes [30] provide a precise mathe-
matical approach by describing scaling limits of random cluster interfaces
and self-avoiding walks in the lattice models. To date, convergence, and in

2

particular conformal invariance, has been established in a few cases: loop-
erased random walk (LERW), the uniform spanning tree, critical percola-
tion, the Ising model, and the discrete Gaussian free ﬁeld [23, 32, 33, 31].
The (uniform measure on) self-avoiding walk is strongly believed to belong
to this collection of models, but whether it actually does remains one of
the most interesting and apparently diﬃcult open problems in probability.
Once a convergence result is established one can use SLE computations to
rigorously derive properties such as critical exponents or dimensions of the
discrete interfaces, see, e.g., [34, 22, 27]. Some ﬁeld theoretic statements
may also be interpreted and given probabilistic and geometric meaning, see,
e.g., [7, 12] and the references in the latter.

SLE curves are constructed using Loewner’s diﬀerential equation.

It
gives the dynamics of a family of Riemann maps from a reference domain
onto a continuously decreasing family of simply connected domains. Un-
der favorable circumstances, as in the case of SLE, there is a non-crossing,
continuous curve such that one gets the decreasing domains by taking the
complements of the growing curve. This Loewner curve comes equipped with
a particular parametrization by capacity which it inherits from the Loewner
equation. Studying SLE in this parametrization is practical for many prob-
lems and we have information about, e.g., sharp Holder exponents, con-
tinuity properties, and ﬁner multifractal relations [29, 15, 9, 10, 11]. Be-
fore the present paper all SLE convergence results we know of consider a
discrete curve reparametrized by capacity, and proves convergence in that
parametrization. This is suﬃcient to study many properties of discrete mod-
els converging to SLE.

However, information is lost when reparametrizing the discrete curve.
A more detailed analysis (see [6] for an example) is possible by considering
the discrete process parametrized by length, in what is sometimes called
its natural parametrization. By this we mean that the curve traverses each
lattice edge in the same amount of time. Since the limiting trace is fractal,
one needs to rescale so that whole curve in a smooth bounded domain is
traversed in time of order 1. It then seems reasonable to expect that the
discrete curve in its natural parametrization converges to SLE equipped with
a diﬀerent parmatrization than capacity. Indeed, this is widely believed to
be true in all the cases where convergence to SLE is known.
The SLE curve with parameter κ ∈ (0, 8) is a random fractal of almost
sure dimension d = 1 + κ/8. With the length rescaling of the discrete curve
in mind, we are looking for a parametrization γ(t) such that rγ[0, t] equals
γ[0, rdt] in distribution; that is, one in which it takes about time O(rd) for
the curve to travel distance r. (Compare this with the discrete interpretation

3

of dimension.) Parametrizing directly by length does not make sense, but
one could try to parametrize by d-dimensional Hausdorﬀ content. It turns
out that this also does not work: the Hausorﬀ content is 0 almost surely [28].
What does work is to parametrize by d-dimensional Minkowski content, so
that

ε2−dArea ({z : dist(z, γ[0, t]) (cid:54) ε}) = t

lim
ε→0+

holds for all t (cid:62) 0. To make sense of this requires work, see [25]. The
resulting parametrization is also called the natural parametrization of SLEκ.
The ﬁrst construction [21] did not use Minkowski content, but went via the
Doob-Meyer decomposition of a supermartingale obtained by integrating
the SLE Green’s function. The “natural time” was deﬁned as the increasing
part in this decomposition. This point of view is important for this paper.
See [21] for other possibilities for the construction.

Our main theorem is that LERW parametrized by renormalized length
converges to SLE2 parametrized by Minkowski content. Let us give a rough
statement. Fix an analytic simply connected domain D with distinct bound-
ary points a, b. For N = 1, 2, . . . , a lattice spacing N−1. We take AN to be
an appropriate simply connected component of N−1Z2 ∩ D with boundary
edges aN , bN approximating a, b. We will measure distance between curves
using a metric on parametrized curves deﬁned as follows: If γ1 : [s1, t1] → C
and γ2 : [s2, t2] → C are continuous curves, then

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)#

|α(t) − t| + sup
s1(cid:54)t(cid:54)t1

where the inﬁmum is over all increasing homeomorphisms α : [s1, t1] →
[s2, t2].
Theorem 1.1. There is a universal constant ˇc and an explicit sequence
εN → 0+ as N → ∞ such that the following holds. For each N, let
η(t), t ∈ [0, Tη], be LERW in AN from aN to bN viewed as a continuous
curve parametrized so that each edge is traversed in time ˇcN−5/4. Let
γ(t), t ∈ [0, Tγ], be chordal SLE2 in D from a to b parametrized by 5/4-
dimensional Minkowski content. There is a coupling of η and γ such that

P{ρ (η, γ) > εN} < εN .

In particular, η converges to γ weakly with respect to the metric ρ.

See Section 2.3 and Theorem 2.4 in particular for a complete statement,
but we mention here that the convergence rate we obtain is logarithmic. The

4

recent paper [6] gives an already worked out application of Theorem 1.1. See
also [1, 2, 13] for additional discussions of discrete models and their relations
to SLE in the natural parametrization.

The starting point of the proof is the main result of [4]: the renormal-
ized probability that LERW uses a ﬁxed interior edge converges towards the
SLE2 Green’s function.
It is important that this result holds for general
domains and that we have estimates on the convergence rate. With these
facts in hand, the ﬁrst step is to revisit the convergence in the capacity
parametrization [23]. We give new proofs using the Green’s function as ob-
servable and derive quantitative bounds on error terms, see also [5]. For
technical reasons it is convenient to work with a discrete diﬀerence version
of Loewner’s equation and we develop the required estimates here. We thus
have a coupling of LERW with SLE2, in which with large probability the
Loewner chains and paths are uniformly close when parametrized by ca-
pacity. The main argument shows that in this coupling, uniformly as the
capacity of the paths is varied, the renormalized length of the LERW is
nearly the same as the Minkowski content of the SLE, except for an event
of small probability. Next we consider martingales given by taking condi-
tional expectations of the total number of steps and the total content of the
LERW and SLE, respectively, given the growing coupled curves sampled at
mesoscopic capacity increments. The idea is to look at the Doob-Meyer de-
compositions of the martingales and use the fact that the Green’s functions
are very close to show that the supermartingale parts are close. This will
then imply that the increasing parts, that is, the naural times, must also
be close. A signiﬁcant complication is to control the contribution of regions
in the complement of the curves where we cannot directly apply the result
of [4]. We handle this by discretizing and at each step restricting attention
to “open” squares for which certain geometric estimates hold that allow us
to estimate using [4]. The contribution of “closed” squares is shown to be
negligible.

Although most of our estimates are speciﬁc to loop-erased random walk
our general method of proof is not. We do not see any obstructions for it
to work for other models as well, if (and this is a big if!) the analogs of the
Green’s function convergence and second moment estimates for the discrete
model are available.

1.2 Overview of the proof of Theorem 1.1
Let us now be more precise about what is needed to carry out this idea
and where in the paper it is done. We will give more detailed deﬁnitions in

5

Section 2.

• We ﬁx an analytic simply connected domain D with distinct boundary

points a0, b0.

• For any lattice spacing N−1 we approximate (D, a0, b0) by a triple
(A, a, b) where A = A(D, N) ⊂ Z2 = Z + iZ is a simply connected
lattice set with boundary edges a, b near N a0, N b0. We often identify
edges with their midpoints.

• We identify each ζ ∈ Z2 with the closed square Sζ of side length 1
centered at ζ. We let DA be the simply connected complex domain
generated by A by taking the (interior of the) union of the squares
corresponding the points of A. Note that N−1DA approximates the
domain D. We will sometimes slightly abuse language and refer to DA
as a “union of squares domain”.

• We write ˇa = N−1a,ˇb = N−1b, ˇD = ˇDA = N−1DA for the quantities
scaled by N−1. As N → ∞, ˇD converges to D in the Carathéodory
sense, and it is not hard to estimate the convergence rate. Indeed (see
Lemma 8.1) there exists a conformal transformation ψ : ˇD → D with
ψ(0) = 0, ψ0(0) > 0,

|ψ(z) − z| (cid:54) c log N

N

z ∈ ˇD,

,

|ψ0(z) − 1| (cid:54)

N dist(z, ∂ ˇD) ,
• We ﬁx a conformal transformation

c

z ∈ ˇD, dist(z, ∂D) (cid:62) c
N

.

F : DA → H, F(a) = 0, F(b) = ∞.

Note that this map is deﬁned only up to a ﬁnal scaling. We will
consider the paths only up to the time that their half plane capacity
reaches one. This half plane capacity is deﬁned in terms of the image
under F and so depends on the scaling. We will be able to consider
the entire path in D by varying the initial F.

• We choose a mesoscopic scale h = N−2u/3 where u > 0 is the exponent
(also denoted by u) in the error term in the main estimate from [4],
see (1.3). We choose the scale this coarse so that this error does not
contribute signiﬁcantly in estimates.

6

• We will choose exponents in many places, but generally we have not
tried to optimize them. Most are anyway functions of the unknown u.
We will mention what relations exponents need to satisfy but we will
often not be explicit about not optimizing.

• We grow a LERW in A from a to b which we denote by η. We write
PA,a,b for the associated probability measure. We stop the path each
time its capacity has increased by h, and write ηn for path stopped
after n mesoscopic increments. By removing the vertices of ηn from
A (taking an appropriate connected component if needed), we have
a sequence of conﬁgurations (A0, a0, b), (A1, a1, b), (A2, a2, b), . . . with
A0 ⊃ A1 ⊃ ··· and we let Dn = DAn. By mesoscopic capacity
increment, we mean the half-plane capacity of H (cid:114) F(Dn) so that
hcap [H (cid:114) F(Dn)] ≈ h n.

• We let gn : H (cid:114) F(Dn) → H be the conformal transformation with
gn(z) = z + o(1), z → ∞; let Fn = gn ◦ F for gn = gn ◦ ··· ◦ g1 where
gn is the corresponding transformation gn : Fn−1(Dn−1 (cid:114) Dn) → H
normalized at inﬁnity. Let

Un = Fn(an),

ξn = Un − Un−1

so that Un is a discrete “driving term” for the LERW.

• Let Pn = PAn,an,b.

In Section 4 we use the fact that Pn {ζ ∈ η}
is a martingale (up to the time that ζ ∈ η), a “Loewner diﬀerence
(cid:16)
h6/5(cid:17)
(cid:16)
equation”, and (1.3), to show that for all n (cid:54) n0 : d1/he,

and that there is β > 0 such that

En−1 [ξn] = O

This is similar to the original argument in [23], but uses a diﬀerent
“observable”, namely the LERW Green’s function. The required esti-
mates about Loewner’s diﬀerence equation are given in Section 3.

• We use Skorokhod embedding to ﬁnd a standard Brownian motion Wt
and a sequence of stopping times 0 = τ0 < τ1 < τ2 < ··· such that
except for an event of small probability,

|Un − Wτn| (cid:54) c h1/5,

max
n(cid:54)n0

see Proposition 4.1.

7

• Given the Brownian motion, there is a corresponding SLE2 path in
H. To be more precise, there is a simple curve γ : [0,∞) → H and
conformal maps gSLE

: H (cid:114) γt → H satisfying

t

∂tgSLE

(z) =

gSLE

Here we write γt = γ[0, t] for the trace in H and we have parametrized
the curve so that hcap[γt] = t. We obtain the SLE in ˇD by ˇγ(t) =
N−1F −1 [γ(t)]; here, we have retained the capacity parametrization.

n

τn (z) =(cid:0)gSLE

(z) = (gn ◦ F) (N z) − Un, ϕSLE

• We let
ϕLERW
and let Gn be the σ-algebra of the coupling, that is, the σ-algebra
generated by the discrete LERW domains Ak, k (cid:54) n, and the Brownian
motion Ws, 0 (cid:54) s (cid:54) τn. We are careful in our construction to make
sure that {Wt − Wτn : t (cid:62) τn} is independent of Gn. If Im ϕSLE
τn (z) (cid:62)
h1/20, then with large probability the two uniformizing maps are close:

• Let T and Tn be the number of steps of η and ηn, respectively, and let
ˇT = N−5/4T and ˇTn = N−5/4Tn be the scaled quantities. Similarly let
ˇΘ be c∗ times the 5/4-dimensional Minkowski content of ˇγ∞, where c∗
is the constant in (1.3) below and let ˇΘt equal c∗ times the Minkowski
content of ˇγt.

• We consider two discrete time Gn-martingales:

is the Green’s function for SLE2 in ˇD (cid:114) ˇγτn from ˇγ(τn) to b and we are
writing rn(z) for the conformal radius of ˇD (cid:114) ˇγτn seen from z.

Notice that Bn is a process of bounded variation being a diﬀerence of
two increasing processes, and Yn is a diﬀerence of two supermartin-
gales.

• The main result of [4] tells us that there are constants c∗ ∈ (0,∞) and

u > 0 such that

Pn{ζ ∈ η} = c∗ GDn(ζ; an, b)(cid:0)1 + O(cid:0)N−u(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

(1.3)

at least if the interior point ζ is not too close to ∂An. So after rescaling
and integrating this relation, taking regularity properties into account,
we expect Yn to be uniformly small.

• In Section 5.4 we will (roughly speaking) use estimates for the coupling
and (1.3) to ﬁnd a δ > 0 so that if εN = (log N)−δ then there is a
“large” stopping time τ such that

– |Yn| (cid:54) εN for all n < τ,

(cid:3) (cid:54) εN,

n is a predictable

• Given this, an argument using the L2-maximum principle shows that
maxn(cid:54)τ |B0
n| is bounded terms of εN, with large probability. In Sec-
tion 6.2 we use this to bound maxn(cid:54)τ |Bn|, and this is the estimate we
want.

A substantial complication in this approach is that the Loewner diﬀer-
ence equation only shows that for suitable ε > 0 the uniformizing LERW and
SLE maps ϕLERW

τn are uniformly close for z ∈ D with Im (cid:2)ϕSLE

hε. We need to also control the contribution of points for which Im (cid:2)ϕSLE
τn (ζ)(cid:3)

is small. Moreover, the error in the precise version of (1.3) depends on the
geometry of the domain seen from ζ. In fact, the curves may a priori both
create large regions of “bad” points, but we will show that the proportion of
bad points that are subsequently visited goes to zero and so do not actually
contribute. We will achieve this by showing that, roughly speaking, all such
points satisfy at least one of the following conditions for each n, and esti-
mate the contribution diﬀerently depending on which. Here we summarize
the deﬁnition for SLE, see Section 5.3 the slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition for
LERW and further discussion. We set λ = h1/100.

I. We have Im(cid:2)ϕSLE

τn (ζ)(cid:3) (cid:62) λ and there exists j (cid:54) n, such that
where Sj(ζ) = sin(cid:2)arg ϕSLE
τn (ζ)(cid:3) .

,

Sj(ζ) (cid:54) [log N]−2/5

Roughly speaking, this means the the path “screens” ζ, e.g., by almost
closing a bubble around it, but the distance between the curve and ζ
may still be large.

τn (ζ)(cid:3) < λ and the distance at time τn from ζ to the

II. We have Im(cid:2)ϕSLE

curve is less than (log N)−5 but the tip of the curve is at least distance
(log N)−1 from ζ, so that the curve “got close to ζ and then away”.

A square Sζ becomes “closed” at time n (and stays closed forever) if
either of the conditions I or II hold for ζ at time n. A square is “open” at
a given time if it is not closed. The idea is to do the argument as sketched
above but instead redeﬁning the processes M SLE
, Mn, Bn, Yn to be
the corresponding quantities referring to the amount of natural time spent
in open squares, that is, time spent before the square has become closed.
For this to work we have to show that it is enough to consider the open
squares and this part of the argument is given in Section 6. The proof of
Theorem 1.1 is completed in Section 5.4, assuming some statements that are
proved in later sections.

n , M LERW

In Section 7 we have collected the needed estimates about LERW. Several

n

of these results are of independent interest, see Section 1.3.

1.3 Other results
The proof of Theorem 1.1 requires sharp one and two-point estimates for
both SLE and LERW. For SLE they have been developed in several recent
papers, and the sharp one-point estimate for LERW is (1.3). The two-point
estimates for LERW need both the one-point estimate and an appropriate

10

separation lemma that states that that two-sided LERW conditioned to
reach a ball about the origin have a good chance of having the endpoints
at the ﬁrst visits from the two directions “separated”. We leave the exact
statements for Section 7.

2 Preliminaries
2.1 Discrete set-up and loop-erased random walk
Here we will give precise deﬁnitions of our discrete quantities.

• If A is a ﬁnite subset of Z2, we let ∂eA denote the edge boundary of A,
that is, the set of edges of Z2 with exactly one endpoint in A. We will
specify elements of ∂eA by a, the midpoint of the edge. Note that a
speciﬁes the edge uniquely up to the orientation. We will write a−, a+
for the endpoints of the edge in Z2 (cid:114) A and A, respectively. Note that

a−, b− ∈ ∂A := {z ∈ Z2 (cid:114) A : dist(z, A) = 1},
a+, b+ ∈ ∂iA := {z ∈ A : dist(z, ∂A) = 1}.

We also write the edge as ea = [a−, a+], eb = [b−, b+] for the edges
oriented from the outside to the inside.

• Let A denote the set of triples (A, a, b) where A is a ﬁnite, simply
connected subset of Z2 containing the origin, and a, b are elements of
∂eA with a− 6= b−. We allow a+ = b+.

• let S = {x + iy ∈ C : |x|,|y| (cid:54) 1/2} be the closed square of side length
one centered at the origin and Sz = z + S. If (A, a, b) ∈ A, let DA be
the corresponding simply connected domain deﬁned as the interior of

[

z∈A

Sz.

This is a simply connected Jordan domain whose boundary is a subset
of the edge set of the dual graph of Z2. Note that a, b ∈ ∂DA. We
refer to DA as a “union of squares” domain.

11

• Let F = FA,a,b denote a conformal map from DA onto H with F(a) =
0, F(b) = ∞. This map is deﬁned only up to a dilation; later we will
ﬁx a particular choice of F. Note that F and F −1 extend continuously
to the boundary of the domain (with the appropriate deﬁnition of
continuity at inﬁnity).
• For z ∈ DA, we deﬁne

θA(z; a, b) = arg F(z), SA,a,b(z) = sin θA(z; a, b),

which are independent of the choice of F, since F is unique up to
scaling. Also for z ∈ H, we write

S(z) = sin[arg(z)].

• We write rA(z) = rDA(z) for the conformal radius of DA with respect

to z. It can be computed from F by

rA(z) = 2 Im F(z)
|F 0(z)| ,

which is independent of the choice of F.

• A walk ω = [ω0, . . . , ωn] is a sequence of nearest neighbors in Z2. The

length |ω| = n is by deﬁnition the number of traversed edges.

• If z, w ∈ A, we write KA(z, w) for the set of walks ω starting at z,

ending at w, and otherwise staying in A.

• The simple random walk measure p assigns to each walk measure
p(ω) = 4−|ω|. The total measure of KA(z, w) equals GA(z, w), the
simple random walk Green’s function.

• If a, b ∈ ∂eA, there is an obvious bijection between KA(a+, b+) and
KA(a, b), the set of walks starting with edge ea, ending with eR
b and
otherwise staying in A. (Here and throughout this section we write
ωR for the reversal of the path ω, that is, if ω = [ω0, ω1, . . . , ωk], then
ωR = [ωk, ωk−1, . . . , ω0].) We sometimes write ω : a → b for walks in
KA(a, b) with the condition to stay in A implicit.

• We write H∂A(a, b) for the total random walk measure of KA(a, b). It
is easy to see that H∂A(a, b) = GA(a+, b+)/16, The factor of 1/16 =
(1/4)2 comes from the p-measure of the edges ea, eb. H∂A(a, b) is called
the boundary Poisson kernel.

12

• A self-avoiding walk (SAW) is a walk visiting each point at most once.
We write WA(z, w) ⊂ KA(z, w) for the set of SAWs from z to w staying
in A. We will write ω for general nearest neighbor paths and reserve η
for SAWs. We write WA(a, b) similarly when a, b are boundary edges.
• The loop-erasing procedure takes a walk and outputs a SAW, the loop-

erasure of ω. Given a walk ω = [ω0, . . . , ωn].

– Set LE[ω] = ω if ω is self-avoiding.
– Otherwise, deﬁne s0 = max{j (cid:54) n : ωj = ω0} and let LE[ω]0 =
– For i (cid:62) 0, if si < n, deﬁne si+1 = max{j (cid:54) n : ωj = ωsi} and set

ωs0.

LE[ω]i+1 = ωsi+1.

Note that if ea ⊕ ω ⊕ eR
LE[ω] ⊕ eR
b .

b ∈ KA(a, b), then LE[ea ⊕ ω ⊕ eR

b ] = ea ⊕

• The loop-erasing procedure induces a natural measure on SAWs as
follows. We deﬁne ˆPA,a,b, the “loop-erased” measure, on WA(a, b) by

X

ˆPA,a,b(η) =

p(ω).

ω∈KA(a,b): LE(ω)=η

This is not a probability measure; indeed the total mass ˆPA,a,b[WA(z, w)] =
H∂A(a, b). Let

PA,a,b =

ˆPA,a,b
H∂A(a, b)

denote the probability measure obtained by normalization. This is the
probability law of loop-erased random walk (LERW) in A from a to b.

We state the main result from [4].

A,a,b(ζ)h1 + O

Lemma 2.1. There exists ˆc > 0 and u > 0 such that the following holds.
Suppose (A, a, b) ∈ A and that ζ ∈ A is such that SA,a,b(ζ) (cid:62) rA(ζ)−u , then
(2.1)

PA,a,b{ζ ∈ η} = ˆc rA(ζ)−3/4S3
We do not have an explicit bound on u except u > 0. We will ﬁx a value
of u such that (2.1) holds for the remainder of the paper. For our purpose
it is more useful to write (2.1) in terms of the Green’s function of SLE2, see
Section 2.2 for the deﬁnition. For now we recall that in this case

GDA(ζ; a, b) = ˜c rA(ζ)−3/4 S3

for some universal (but unknown) ˜c > 0. Therefore, we may rewrite (2.1) as

A,a,b(ζ)i

(2.2)

where c∗ = ˆc/˜c.

2.2 SLE and Minkowski content
We now recall some facts about SLE. Chordal SLEκ in H is deﬁned by ﬁrst
solving the Loewner equation

∂tgt(z) =

a

gt(z) − Bt

,

g0(z) = z,

a = 2/κ,

with Bt a standard Brownian motion. For each t (cid:62) 0, gt(z) is a conformal
map from a simply connected domain Ht onto H normalized so that gt(z) =
z + at/z + O(1/|z|2) as z → ∞. The family (gt(z)) is called the SLEκ
Loewner chain. The SLEκ path is the continuous curve deﬁned by

γ(t) = lim
y→0+

g−1

t

(iy + Bt).

The curve generates the Loewner chain in the sense that Ht is the unbounded
component of H (cid:114) γt, where γt = γ[0, t]. As t → ∞, this curve connects
0 with ∞ in H. The compact set which is disconnected from ∞ by γt is
called the SLEκ hull (in general, a hull is a compact set such that H (cid:114) K
is unbounded and simply connected) and is denoted Kt. If κ (cid:54) 4, then γ is
simple so that Kt = γt.
Given a hull K there is a Riemann map g : H (cid:114) K → H such that
g(z) = z + o(1) as z → ∞. We deﬁne the half-plane capacity of K by

hcap[K] = lim

|z|→∞ z (g(z) − z) .

If γ is parametrized so that hcap[Kt] = at, we say that γ is parametrized
by capacity.

Given a simply connected domain D with marked boundary points (prime
ends in general) a, b, we deﬁne SLEκ in D from a to b by conformal in-
variance. That is, we choose a conformal map ϕ : D → H such that
ϕ(a) = 0, ϕ(b) = ∞ and consider the image of γ under ϕ−1. The map
ϕ is only unique up to scaling, but allowing for a linear reparametrization
the law of γ is scale invariant.

The Green’s function for SLEκ in H is the function deﬁned by

GH(z; 0,∞) = lim
ε→0+

εd−2P{dist(z, γ∞) (cid:54) ε} .

14

(We suppress the κ-dependence.) We have the formula

GH(z; 0,∞) = ˜c (Im z)d−2 sinβ (arg z) ,

β = 4a − 1,

where ˜c ∈ (0,∞) is a κ-dependent but unknown constant. (Replacing Eu-
clidean distance by conformal radius results in the same formula with a
computable constant.) Using conformal covariance we can see that

GD(z; a, b) = ˜c rD(z)d−2 sinβ (arg ϕ(z)) ,

where ϕ : D → H is as in the previous paragraph.

Besides the capacity parametrization, the natural parametrization of SLE
is important for this paper. Let us review a few facts about it, see [25] for
proofs and further discussion. The simplest deﬁnition to state is in terms of
d-dimensional Minkowski content: given γt, we can deﬁne

Θt = Contd (γt) = lim
ε→0+

εd−2Area{z : dist(z, γt) (cid:54) ε} .

Then almost surely this limit exists for all t and t 7→ Θt is Holder continuous.
Setting

s(t) = inf {s (cid:62) 0 : Θs = t} ,

we may reparametrize γ by Minkowski content, so that γN P (t) = γ(s(t)).
We say that γN P (t) is SLEκ in the natural parametrization (or parametrized
by natural time). When we do not specify d, e.g., by simply writing Cont(·)
we are assuming d = 5/4. Suppose D is a bounded simply connected domain
with (say) analytic boundary. An important property of the Minkowski
content is that if γ is SLEκ in D from a to b, and V ⊂ D, then
E [Contd(γ∞ ∩ V ) | γt] = Contd(γt ∩ V ) +

GD(cid:114)γt(z; γ(t), b) dA(z).

Z

V (cid:114)γt

Z

D(cid:114)γt

In particular, E[Θ∞] =R

D GD(z; a, b) dA(z) < ∞ and

E [Θ∞ | γt] = Θt +

GD(cid:114)γt(z; γ(t), b) dA(z)

is a martingale, and the two terms on the right hand side form its Doob-
Meyer decomposition into an increasing process and a supermartingale, re-
spectively.

In several places, sometimes without explicit reference, we will use the
one-point estimate for SLE. We state one version here, see Section 2.2 of
[25] for this and other versions.

15

Lemma 2.2. Suppose 0 < κ < 8. There exist positive constants c∗, α such
that the following holds. Let γ be SLEκ in D from a to b, where D is a
simply connected domain with distinct boundary points (prime ends) a, b.
Then for all z ∈ D with dist(z, ∂D) (cid:62) 2ε,

P{γ ∩ B(z, ε) 6= ∅} = c∗ε2−dGD(z; a, b) [1 + O(εα)] ,

where GD(z; a, b) is the Green’s function for SLEκ from a to b in D.

We will also need the following estimate on the probability that SLEκ
gets near the boundary. We formulate it in terms of excursion measure, see,
e.g., [25] for the deﬁnition.
Lemma 2.3. Suppose 0 < κ < 8 and suppose γ is SLEκ in H from 0 to ∞.
There is a constant c < ∞ such that the following holds. Let σ be a crosscut
of H of diameter < 1/2 separating 1 from ∞. Then

P{γ ∩ σ 6= ∅} (cid:54) cEH(cid:114)σ(R−, σ)8/κ−1,

where E denotes excursion measure.

2.3 Complete statement of main result
We will now give a complete statement of our main result. In order to do
so, we will have to scale the lattice path.

• Given η ∈ WA(a, b), of the form

η = [η0 = a−, η1 = a+, . . . , ηn = b+, ηn+1 = b−],

we write η(t) for the curve obtained by going from a to b along η
at speed one. More precisely, η(t), 0 (cid:54) t (cid:54) n, is deﬁned by η(0) =
a; η(n) = b;

= ηj,

j = 1, . . . , n;

(cid:18)

η

(cid:19)

j − 1
2

and η(t) is deﬁned for other t by linear interpolation.

• If η(t), 0 (cid:54) t (cid:54) n is a curve as above and N > 0, we let ηN(t) denote

the scaled map

ηN(t) = N−1 η(t c∗ N 5/4),

0 (cid:54) t (cid:54)

n

c∗ N 5/4 .

Here c∗ is the constant from (2.2).

16

• We write PN

A,a,b for the probability measure obtained from PA,a,b by

considering the curves scaled as above.

• If η = [η0, . . . , ηk] ∈ WA(a, b), let ηj = [η0, . . . , ηj], Aj = A (cid:114) ηj and
aj = [ηj+ηj+1]/2 so that aj ∈ ∂eAj. The tuples (Aj, aj, b), j = 0, 1, . . .
form a sequence of decreasing discrete domains with two marked bound-
ary edges. We write Dj = DAj. Note that Dj is obtained from DA by
removing the j squares associated to ﬁrst j steps of η plus any squares
that have become disconnected from 0.

• We will assume that we have a bounded analytic simply connected do-
main D containing the origin with analytic boundary and two distinct
boundary points a0, b0. We will consider lattice approximations of D.
The lattice scaling will be N−1. We will deﬁne some scaled quantities,
but the dependence on N will be implicit.

• The assumption that D is analytic is of course not necessary – we
will make it for convenience, but remark that by an approximation
argument our main result can be extended to more general domains,
assuming local analyticity at a0, b0.

• If N > 0, let A = AN,D be the connected component containing the
origin of the set of ζ ∈ Z2 with Sζ ⊂ N D. Let DA be the corresponding
domain obtained by taking the interior of the union of the Sζ. Let
ˇDA = N−1 DA. If a ∈ ∂eA, we write ˇa for the midpoint of the edge
a/N. We sometimes identify an edge with its midpoint.

• We consider the metric (1.1) on continuous curves and write ℘ρ for the
corresponding Prokhorov metric on probability measures on curves.
• If D is a domain as above and a, b are distinct boundary points, then
µD(a, b) denotes the probability measure given by SLE2 with the nat-
ural parametrization. (In other papers of the ﬁrst author, the notation
measure µD(a, b) refers to SLE with total mass of the partition func-
tion and the probability measure and the corresponding probability
#
measure denoted by µ
D(a, b). However, since we only need to use the
probability measure in this paper, we choose the simpler notation.)

Theorem 2.4. Let D be a bounded analytic domain containing the origin
with distinct boundary points a0, b0. For each N, let AN = AN,D and let
aN , bN ∈ ∂eAN with

ˇa := aN /N → a0,

ˇb := bN /N → b0.

17

Then

where the convergence is with respect to the Prokhorov metric as above.

We start by making some reductions. It is not diﬃcult (see Corollary

8.5) to show that

−→ µD(a0, b0),

h

µ ˇD(ˇa,ˇb), µD(a0, b0)i = 0.

lim
N→∞ ℘

and

AN ,aN ,bN

Hence, it suﬃces to show that ℘ [νN , ˜νN] −→ 0, where νN = PN
˜νN = µ ˇD(ˇa,ˇb).
In order to compare νN , ˜νN we consider the paths parametrized by half-
plane capacity. This capacity is deﬁned by ﬁrst taking F : DA → H with
FN(aN) = 0, FN(bN) = ∞ and measuring capacities of the images under F.
The map F is unique up to a ﬁnal dilation.
For every k < ∞, we can consider the measures νN , ˜νN on paths stopped
when the capacity reaches k. Since the total capacity of the curves is inﬁnite,
this truncation is well deﬁned and does not give the entire curve. In order
to get convergence in the Prokhorov metric we need two facts. The ﬁrst:

• The curves parametrized by capacity are very close in supremum norm

except for small probability.

This has been proved previously for LERW convergence in capacity parametriza-
tion using a slightly diﬀerent coupling, see [23, 8]. While we could repeat a
similar argument, we choose to omit it in this paper, see however [26]. The
second is the one that we focus on:

• If we reparametrize by length (using normalized number of steps for the
LERW and Minkowski content for the SLE), the reparametrizations
are very close in supremum norm except for small probability.

Let νN,k, ˜νN,k denote the corresponding measures on curves parametrized
by length but truncated when their capacity reaches k. We will show that
℘ [νN,k, ˜νN,k] is small. We also need to show for LERW and for SLE that
as k → ∞, both ℘ [νN,k, νN] and ℘ [˜νN,k, ˜νk] are bounded by εk for some
εk → 0 (independent of N). This is discussed in Section 8.

Finally, rather than take a particular F and showing the estimates for
paths truncated at capacity k, we will start with any F and truncate at
capacity 1. Note that paths truncated at capacity k for a given F are the
same as those truncated at capacity 1 for F ∗(z) = k−1/2 F(z).

This is the main theorem of this paper and precise statements can be

found in (5.1) and (5.2).

3 Deterministic estimates
3.1 Loewner diﬀerence equation
Suppose γ : (0,∞) → H is a simple curve with γ(0+) = 0 parametrized so
that hcap[γt] = t, where γt = γ[0, t]. Let gt : H (cid:114) γt → H be the conformal
transformation with gt(z) = z + o(1) as z → ∞. Then we have the chordal
Loewner diﬀerential equation,

∂tgt(z) =

a

gt(z) − Ut

,

g0(z) = z,

where Ut = gt(γ(t)). We will set a = 1. The proof of this correspondence,
at least as given in [17], starts by proving a “diﬀerence estimate” to show
that for small t,

gt(z) − z = t
z

+ O

(cid:18) tr

|z|2

(cid:19)

,

where r denotes the radius of γt. This estimate does not require γt to be the
image of a curve and in fact holds with an error term uniformly bounded
over all hulls (see below) of half-plane capacity t and radius r.

Our domains Dn = DAn are derived from DA by cutting out squares
rather than a curve, so it will be more useful to use the diﬀerence equation
form of the Loewner equation. One could of course work with slit domains
and translate results, but we feel the diﬀerence equation approach produces
cleaner arguments in the present setting. Here we derive some of the neces-
sary estimates. This subsection will be self-contained and the notation will
vary slightly from other parts of the paper.
We will say that K ⊂ H is a (compact H-)hull, if K is bounded and

DK := H (cid:114) K is simply connected. Deﬁne

rK = rad(K) = max{|z| : z ∈ K},

hK = hcap(K),

and recall that hK (cid:54) r2
K. If rK is small, K is located near 0. Let gK be the
unique conformal transformation of DK onto H whose expansion at inﬁnity
is

We set

gK(z) = z + hK
z

+ O(|z|−2).

ΥK(z) = Im [gK(z)]

and recall that 2ΥK(z) is the conformal radius of DK seen from z.

U ∈ R; K is a hull with rK < 1/2; z = x + iy; and let g, r, h, Υ denote

Suppose now we have a sequence of hulls of small capacity K1, K2, . . .
and “locations” U1, U2, . . . ∈ R, so that, roughly speaking Kj + Uj is near
Uj. Let

rj = rKj ,

hj = hKj ,

gj = gKj+Uj

and let

If z ∈ H, we deﬁne

gj = gj ◦ ··· ◦ g1.

zj = xj + iyj = gj(z).

This is deﬁned up to the ﬁrst j such that zj − Uj ∈ Kj. (Recall that Kj
is located near 0.) A key fact (and the basis of the Loewner diﬀerential
equation) is that the left-hand side of (3.3) depends only on h, U and not on
the exact shape of K. This implies that if we have two sequences for which
the capacity increments and “driving terms”, hj and Uj, are close, then we
would expect the functions ϕn to be close. We give a precise formulation of
this in the next proposition. See [8] for analogous estimates (and arguments)
using the Loewner diﬀerential equation.
Proposition 3.2. There exists 1 < c < ∞ such that the following holds.
Suppose (K1, U1), (K2, U2) . . . and ( ˜K1, ˜U1), ( ˜K2, ˜U2), . . . are two sequences
as above with corresponding rj, hj, gj, gj and ˜rj, ˜hj, ˜gj, ˜gj. Let

0 < h < r2 < ε2 < δ8 < 1/c,
and n (cid:54) 1/h and suppose that for all j = 1, . . . , n,

|hj − h| (cid:54) hr/δ,

|˜hj − h| (cid:54) hr/δ,

Suppose z = x+iy ∈ H and let zn = xn+iyn = gn(z), ˜zn = ˜xn+i˜yn = ˜gn(z).
Then, if yn, ˜yn (cid:62) δ,

|gn(z) − ˜gn(z)| (cid:54) c (ε/δ) (y ∧ 1).

(3.5)
Moreover, if we assume that yn (cid:62) 2δ and make no a priori assumptions on
˜yn, then ˜yn (cid:62) δ holds, and hence (3.5) follows in this case, too.
Proof. Note that nh (cid:54) 1, and hence if y (cid:62) 3, we know that yn (cid:62) δ. Without
loss of generality, we will assume that y (cid:54) 3; for y (cid:62) 3, we can use the fact
that ϕn − ˜ϕn is a bounded holomorphic function on {Im (w) > 3} that goes
to zero as w → ∞, and hence

|gn(z) − ˜gn(z)| (cid:54) max{|gn(s + 3i) − ˜gn(s + 3i)| : s ∈ R}.

Hence we see that

provided that the right-hand side is less than δ/2. Since y (cid:54) 3 and ε (cid:54) δ4,
this will be true if δ is suﬃciently small.
For the ﬁnal assertion, suppose that j is such that ˜yj (cid:62) δ. Then since
ε (cid:54) δ4, we can use (3.5) to see that |yj − ˜yj| (cid:54) c(ε/δ)y (cid:54) O(δ4). Since
yj (cid:62) 2δ, it follows that ˜yj (cid:62) 2δ(1−O(δ3)). But |˜yj+1−˜yj| (cid:54) c0hj/yj (cid:54) O(δ7).
Consequently, as long as δ is suﬃciently small, taking c larger if necessary,
we can continue until j = n.

Corollary 3.3. Suppose we make the assumptions of the previous proposi-
tion, but replace the condition yn (cid:62) 2δ with

Then the results still hold for δ suﬃciently small.

3.2 Expansion of the observable
Recall that the SLE2 Green’s function for a domain (D, a, b) equals

−3/4
D (z)S3
r

D,a,b(z).

We shall later use the LERW analog as observable for proving convergence
to SLE2. We will here give a computation showing how the Green’s function
(for general κ) changes when the domain is perturbed by growing a small
hull.

We let z± = i ± 1 and note that

sin[arg(z±)] =

√
2
2 .

Lemma 3.5. Suppose K is a hull, r = rK = diam(K), h = hK = hcap(K),
U ∈ [−(rh)1/3, (rh)1/3], z± = i ± 1. Then,
Im [g(z±)] = 1 − h

Proof. We will show the result for z+; the argument for z− is identical. Let
us write

w = g(z+) = x + iy = |w| ei arg w,

where arg w ∈ [0, π]. Using (3.3), we see that

x = 1 + h

2 + O(hr).

Using (3.4) and the fact that z2± is purely imaginary, we see that

|g0(z±)| = 1 + O(hr).

We now want to expand arg(g(z+)− U) = arg(w − U) up to O(hr) + O(r3).
Proceeding directly by Taylor expansion becomes a bit messy, so we will
ﬁrst exploit the harmonicity. For the moment, let us assume that U (cid:62) 0.
Let ψ(ζ) = arg(ζ − U) − arg(ζ). By the maximum principle ψ(ζ) equals π
times the probability that a Brownian motion exits H in [0, U]. Since ψ is a
positive harmonic function, and |z+ − w| = O(h), we have
|ψ(z+) − ψ(w)| (cid:54) ch|ψ(z+)| = O(hr),

that is, ψ(w) = ψ(z+) [1 + O(hr)]. Hence, using the Poisson kernel for H,

arg (w − U) = ψ(w) + arg(w)
4 − h

Z U
= ψ(z+) + π
dt

If U < 0, we need to consider the probability of hitting the boundary in
[U, 0], but the same basic argument shows that in this case

The expansion of the observable is an immediately consequence. We will

4 Coupling
In this section we derive the coupling results we will use. The basic method
we follow is the same as in [23] but we work with a diﬀerent observable,
namely the LERW Green’s function. The resulting coupling is slightly dif-
ferent from the one of [23] since we will work only with the Loewner dif-
ference equation. We will give quantitative estimates (in terms however
of the unknown exponent in (2.1)), but we have not bothered to optimize
exponents.

4.1 Coupling of driving terms
We will consider 4-tuples (A, a, b, F) where (A, a, b) ∈ A. Recall that we
write F : DA → H for a conformal transformation with F(a) = 0, F(b) = ∞.

27

As we have noted before, there is a one-parameter family of such transfor-
mations F, so we will ﬁx one of them. We deﬁne

N = N(A, a, b, F) = |(F −1)0(i)|

and note that N is half the conformal radius of DA seen from F −1(i). We
will prove facts for N suﬃciently large and we will not be explicit about
this.

We ﬁx a mesoscopic scale h, deﬁned by
h = N−2u/3,

where u is the exponent from (2.1). This is somewhat arbitrary, but we will
use that N−u = O(h6/5).

Let (A0, a0, b) = (A, a, b), D0 = DA, F0 = F. We will deﬁne a sequence
(An, an, b) with corresponding simply connected domains Dn and functions
recursively by saying that (An, an, b) is chosen given (An−1, an−1, b)
F LERW
according to the LERW probability measure Pn−1 := PAn−1,an−1,b where the
walk (taking microscopic lattice steps) is stopped at the ﬁrst time m = mn
such that

n

diam[Km] (cid:62) h2/5

or

hcap[Km] (cid:62) h,

where

Kj = Fn−1(DAn−1 (cid:114) DAn−1(cid:114)ηj) ⊂ H

(4.1)

and η is LERW in An−1 from an−1 to b. We set Dn = DAn and

n

F LERW

= gn ◦ F0 − Un, Un := gn ◦ F0(an).

where gn : F0(D0 (cid:114) Dn) → H is the conformal transformation normalized
so that gn(∞) = ∞, g0

translated so that F LERW
Proposition 4.1. Let D, a0, b0, F be given. Then for each N, we can deﬁne

times τ0 (cid:54) τ1 (cid:54) ··· τn0 for the Brownian motion on the same probability
space such that the following holds.

• The distribution of {(An, an, b)} is that of the LERW domains corre-
sponding to PDA,a,b sampled at mesoscopic scale, as described above.

28

• Let Gn denote the σ-algebra generated by {(Aj, aj, b) : j = 0 . . . , n}

and {Wt : t (cid:54) τn}. Then,

{(Aj, aj, b) : j > n},
{Wt+τn − Wτn : t (cid:62) 0}

are conditionally independent of Gn given (An, an, b).

• There exists a stopping time n∗ (cid:54) n0 with respect to {Gn} such that

P{n∗ < n0} (cid:54) c h1/10,

such that for n (cid:54) n∗,

|Wτn − Un| (cid:54) h1/10;
|τn − nh| (cid:54) h1/5;

|Wt − Wτn−1| (cid:54) h2/5;

• Let Kn be as in (4.1). For n (cid:54) n∗, hcap(Kn) (cid:54) h + h2. Moreover, for

n < n∗, hcap(Kn) (cid:62) h.

The proof will be completed at the end of this subsection.

4.1.1 One step
We begin by discussing the estimates for one mesoscopic increment of the
LERW. Suppose η is a SAW chosen from the LERW probability measure
PA,a,b and that Aj = A (cid:114) ηj, where ηj = η[0, j] is considered taking (micro-
scopic) lattice steps. We introduce a stopping time m depending on A, a, b, F
as follows:

j (cid:62) 0 : hcap [Kj] (cid:62) h or diam [Kj] (cid:62) h2/5o

m = minn

,

(4.3)

where Kj = F(D (cid:114) DAj). We deﬁne for j = 0, 1, . . . ,
rj = diam[Kj].

tj = hcap[Kj],

Using the Beurling estimate, we can see that

tm (cid:54) h + O(N−1),

rm (cid:54) h2/5 + O(N−1/2).

We expect however that tm is very close to h and that rm is close to h1/2.

29

Lemma 4.2. There exist 0 < α, c < ∞ such that for N suﬃciently large, if
(A, a, b, F) are as above, then for R > 0,

n
rm (cid:62) R h1/2o (cid:54) c e−αR.

PA,a,b

Proof. We sketch the proof here; for details see Section 7.8. We consider
√
m0, the ﬁrst j such that hcap[Kj] (cid:62) h or diam[Kj] (cid:62) 4
h. The key step
is to show that there exists uniform ρ > 0 such that with probability at
√
least ρ, we have diam[Km0] < 4
h. If this happens we stop; otherwise, we
do the same thing on the new walk. The probability of doing this J times
without success is at most (1− ρ)J. If we have succeded within J steps than
diam[Km] (cid:54) O(J

h).

√

Note that F(DAm) is an unbounded simply connected subset of H and

we let g be the uniformizing conformal map normalized so that

g : F(DAm) → H,

g(z) = z + o(z),

z → ∞.

We write

ξ = g(am)

and ﬁnally set Fm = g ◦ F.
Lemma 4.3. There exist 0 < β, c < ∞ such that we have the estimates

Proof. Write z± = i ± 1 and H = F −1. Then H maps H onto DA. Let
w, ζ+, ζ− be points in A ⊂ Z2 closest to H(i), H(z+), H(z−), respectively.
In case of ties, we choose arbitrarily. Note that the domain Markov property
for loop-erased random walk implies that
PA,a,b{ζ± ∈ η} = EA,a,b

hPA1,a1,b{ζ± ∈ η}i

(4.5)

.

We will estimate the two sides of this equation. To keep notation lighter we
will write z = z± and ζ = ζ±. We begin with the left-hand side for which
we can use (2.1) directly. Recall that N = |H0(i)|. By distortion estimates
we know that

|F(w) − i| ,|F(ζ) − z| (cid:54) O(N−1)

30

and

|F 0(ζ)|−1 = |H0(z)|(cid:16)1 + O(N−1)(cid:17)

.

Hence,

rDA(ζ) = 2|H0(z)|(cid:16)1 + O(N−1)(cid:17)

It follows from (2.1) that

PA,a,b{ζ ∈ η} = c0|H0(z)|−3/4

sin(arg F(ζ)) =

where we used that N−u = O(h6/5) and set c0 := ˆc 2−3/4. We now estimate
the right-hand side of (4.5). By the chain rule and distortion estimates,

rD1(ζ) = 2Im g(z)

|g0(z)| |H0(z)|(1 + O(N−1)),

sin (arg [g ◦ F(ζ) − ξ]) = sin [arg (g(z) − ξ)] + O(N−1).

So, by (2.1)
PA1,a1,b{ζ ∈ η}

= c0|H0(z)|−3/4(cid:18)Im g(z)
(cid:18)Im g(z)

|g0(z)|

= 23/2PA,a,b{ζ ∈ η}

(4.6)
Note that r = diam(Km) (cid:54) h2/5 + O(N−1) so there is a constant c such
that |ξ| (cid:54) ch2/5 for h suﬃciently small. Hence O(hr + r3) = O
we can apply Proposition 3.5 with κ = 2 to get

(cid:19)−3/4(cid:16)sin3 [arg(g(z) − ξ)] + O(h6/5)(cid:17)

assertion of the lemma.

Proposition 4.4. There exist 0 < α, C < ∞ such that one can deﬁne on
the same probability space a random variable ξ with the distribution PA,a,b
and a standard Wiener process Wt, and a stopping time for Wt such that
ξ − µ = Wτ where µ = EA,a,b[ξ]. Moreover,

Proof. This can be seen from the standard construction via Skorokhod em-
bedding. The last inequality uses (4.4).

4.1.2 Sequence and Loewner chain
We start with (A, a, b, F) as in the previous section, and having chosen
a mesoscopic scale h. We have deﬁned a step in a sequence of 4-tuples
(A, a, b, F) → (Am, am, b, Fm) which corresponds to a mesoscopic capacity
increment of the LERW. We can continue this process to deﬁne a sequence
of 4-tuples. The estimates of Lemma 4.3 will hold as long as the conformal
radius is comparable to that of A. By the domain Markov property this
corresponds to a sequence of stopping times for the LERW path stopped at
mesoscopic capacity increments.

Let us be more precise. We write D0 = DA, Dj = DAj. Set m0 =

0, m1 = m, where m is as in (4.3), and for n = 0, 1, . . . , and j = 0, 1, . . .,

Kj = F(D (cid:114) Dj), Kn

j = Fmn(Dmn

(cid:114) Dmn+j),

and

∆n = minn

j (cid:62) 0 : hcap[Kn

j ] (cid:62) h or diam[Kn

j ] (cid:62) h2/5o

,

32

Write

Then

and we set

mn+1 = mn + ∆n.

Kn = Kn∆n.

tmn+1 = tmn + hcap [Kn] .

rmn+1 = diam [Kn] .

Let gn+1 : H(cid:114) Kn → H be the conformal transformation with gn+1(z)− z =
o(1) and set Fmn+1 = gn+1 ◦ Fmn and

gn+1 = gn+1 ◦ gn ◦ ··· ◦ g1.

We also deﬁne the “driving process increment”,

ξn+1 = gn+1 ◦ Fmn(amn) − ξn,

giving a “driving process”

Un+1 = ξ1 + ··· + ξn+1.

(4.7)

Write also

Hn = F(Dmn) ⊂ H.

We continue this process until n0, the ﬁrst time n such that

diam [F(Kmn)] (cid:62) 1/4

or

hcap [F(Kmn)] (cid:62) 1/4.

Note that n0 − 1 (cid:54) 1/h and that for n < n0,
hcap [F(D0 (cid:114) Dn)] (cid:54) 1/4,

|Xn| (cid:54) 1/4,

|(F −1

mn)0(i)| (cid:16) |(F −1)0(i)| = N,

Using the Beurling estimate, we can see that for n < n0, the mesoscopic
increments satisfy

tmn − tmn−1 (cid:54) h + O(N−1),

rmn − rmn−1 (cid:54) h2/5 + O(N−1/2).

Let Fn denote the σ-algebra generated by (A0, a0, b),··· , (Amn, amn, b).

Moreover, if Gn denotes the σ-algebra generated by ˆFn and Fτn, then
t 7→ Wt+τn − Wτn is independent of Gn and the distribution of the LERW
given Gn is the same as the distribution given ˆFn.
Proof. We use Lemma 4.3 to see that there is a constant c < ∞ such that
on the event n0 (cid:62) n,

ξ4

Here the error terms are uniform in n (cid:54) n0.

Let

δn = ξn − E[ξn | ˆFn−1].

This is clearly a martingale diﬀerence sequence. We use the Skorokhod
embedding theorem to deﬁne a standard Brownian motion Wt, generating
the ﬁltration Ft, and a sequence of stopping times 0 = τ0 < τ1 < . . . for W
such that

Wτn − Wτn−1 = δn.

It is important that this coupling has the property that it does not look
“into the future of the LERW”. That is to say, if Gn denotes the σ-algebra
generated by ˜Fτn and Fn, then the Brownian motion t 7→ Wt+τn − Wτn is
independent of Gn and the distribution of the LERW in the future given Gn
is the same as the distribution given Fn.

Proof of Proposition 4.1. We deﬁne n∗ to be the minimum of n0 and the
ﬁrst n such that either of

|τn − nh| > h1/5;

|Wt − Wτn−1| > h2/5;

Lemma 4.5 and Lemma 4.2 we see that P{n∗ < n0} = O(h1/10).

Given the Brownian motion Wt of Proposition 4.1, there is a correspond-
ing SLE2 Loewner chain (gSLE
) obtained by solving the Loewner diﬀerential
equation with Wt as driving term. The Loewner chain is generated by
an SLE2 path in H that we denote by γ(t). Let ˆγ(t) = ˆF −1[γ(t)] which
is an SLE2 path from ˆa to ˆb in ˆDA parametrized by capacity in H (this
parametrization depends on F but we have ﬁxed F.) We write

5 Core argument
5.1 Setup
At this point we will quickly review our setup.

• We start with an analytic domain D containing the origin and with dis-
tinct boundary points a0, b0. For each integer N > 0 we deﬁne (A, a, b)
(and the associated union of squares domain DA) as the discrete ap-
proximations of (N D, N a0, N b0) with a choice of conformal transfor-
mation F : DA → H with F(a) = 0, F(b) = ∞, Im [F(0)] = 1 + o(1).
All constants, implicit or explicit, may depend on D, a0, b0, F, but are
otherwise universal.

• Let

h = hN = N−2u/3, n0 = n0,N = bh−1c,

be the mesoscopic scale, where u is the exponent in (2.1).

• Let Tn = m1 + ··· + mn denote the number of steps of the LERW

taken after n mesoscopic steps, see Section 4.1.2.

• The scaled LERW η(t), 0 (cid:54) t (cid:54) 1, in ˇD parametrized by capacity is

given by

ˇη(nh) = N−1ηTn.

(It is not important how we choose the parametrization to linearly
interpolate between times (n − 1)h and nh.

• As in Section 4 we will couple the LERW with an SLE2 path ˆγ in DA

parameterized by capacity so that

hcap (F ◦ ˆγ[0, t]) = t.

We let ˇγ(t) = N−1 ˆγ(t) be the corresponding SLE2 in ˇD = ˇDA.

37

• Let

ˇTnh = c−1∗ N−5/4 Tn

be the scaled number of steps in the walk. Let

ˇΘt = Cont (ˇγ[0, t])

be the 5/4-dimensional Minkowski content of ˇγ[0, t].

We can now state the main result. We will prove it with

εn = c (log N)−1/60

where c depends on D, a0, b0, F.
Theorem 5.1. There exists εN → 0 such that except for an event of prob-
ability at most c εN,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:54) εN .

(5.1)

(5.2)

The estimate (5.1) with an unspeciﬁed sequence εN was done in [23]
(actually a slightly diﬀerent coupling was used but the argument is nearly
the same) and the convergence rate was estimated in [5, 8]. See however [26]
for (5.1) with a polynomial convergence rate in the case of the coupling used
in this paper. We will only worry about proving the new estimate (5.2). We
will work in the coupling of Section 4. We encourage the reader to recall
the general idea of the proof as outlined in Section 1.2.
we will assume n (cid:54) n∗, where n∗ is as in Proposition 4.1.

For the remainder, we ﬁx N and a coupling as above. Where we use n,

5.2 Maximal estimate
We will need to know that neither the Minkowski content nor the scaled
number of steps visited by the loop-erased random walk can get large on a
small region. To make this precise, we let B(z, ε) denote the closed disk of
radius ε about z and deﬁne

JSLE = N−5/4 sup
z∈C

Cont [ˆγ ∩ B(z, N/ log N)]

Cont [ˇγ ∩ B(z, 1/ log N)] .

= sup
z∈C

38

Here we recall that ˆγ is the SLE path from a to b in DA and ˇγ is the scaled
path in ˇDA. The LERW analogue is
JLERW = N−5/4 sup
z∈C

1{ζ ∈ η}.

Proof. In the case of LERW, we prove this in Proposition 7.8 after estab-
lishing a bound on the second moment for the number of steps of the walk.
The estimate for SLE was done in [25] where a similar maximal estimate
is the key step for establishing Hölder continuity of the Minkowski content
with respect to capacity parametrization. One could also mimic the proof
in Proposition 7.8 for the SLE case.

5.3 Open and closed squares: deﬁnitions
Throughout this section we set

λ = λN = h1/100.
In the following deﬁnition recall that Im [F SLE

Figure 5.1: Top: Closed square of Type I. The distance from the real line
after uniformizing is quite large, but the sine of the argument along the path
is small. Bottom: Closed square of Type II. The path got close to the square
and then got away. In this ﬁgure, the unlikely event that the path returned
again has occurred. As the curves grow, many squares may close, but the
proportion that are subsequently visited is small.

Deﬁnition 5.4. We will say that the square Sζ, ζ ∈ A, is closed for
LERW at step n if either of I or II holds at t = τn, where:

distance O((log N) /N) of the tip: If SH(cid:114)γτn(F(ζ); γ(τn),∞) (cid:62) (log N)−2/5
we have derivative estimates. The conclusion is that the distance to the
boundary is o(N/ (log N)5).

In both cases, once a square is closed it stays closed forever. A square
is said to be open for SLE (for LERW) at step n if it is not closed for SLE
(for LERW) at step n.
for the indicator functions of the event
We will write OSLE
that Sζ is open for SLE and LERW, respectively. Then we have the following
properties:

• If Im [F SLE
• If n (cid:54) m, and OSLE
m,ζ = 0.
The next observation is that a square Sζ cannot still be open if it both
far from the tip and the conformal map has a small imaginary part. The
essential idea is that in order for the imaginary part to be small but for the
curve to not get close to the point, there must be a time when the sine of
the angle was small.
Proposition 5.5.

n,ζ = 0 then OLERW

• Suppose Sζ is open for SLE at step n. Then either Im [F SLE

or |ζ − ˆγ(t)| (cid:54) N/ (log N).

• Suppose Sζ is open for LERW at step n. Then either Im [F SLE

n (ζ)] (cid:62) λ

or |ζ − an| (cid:54) N/ (log N).

41

Proof. Let z = F(ζ) and suppose Im (z) (cid:54) 20 and let ρ = τk where k is the
ﬁrst n with Im [gτn(z)] (cid:54) λ. Then using Koebe’s theorem,

dist (ζ, ∂(DA (cid:114) ˆγρ)) (cid:16) N

If Sζ is still open, then (3.11) implies that

λ

ρ(z)| (cid:54) cλ2ν2
|g0

,

ν = (log N)−2/5

.

Combining these estimates gives dist(ζ, ∂(DA (cid:114) ˆγρ)) = o(N/ (log N)5).

A similar argument (using Lemma 4.6) shows the same for the LERW.
We can restate this as follows. Suppose ζ ∈ A with Im [F(ζ)] (cid:62) λ,
• The square Sζ stays open until either the sine of the argument gets too
small or the imaginary part drops below λ. We measure the argument
using the SLE path but by the coupling, since the imaginary part is
at least λ, it is almost the same as measuring using the LERW.

• If the sine gets too small, Sζ closes.
• If the imaginary part of F SLE

n

we know that ζ is within distance N/ (log N)5 of the boundary.

(ζ) drops below λ and Sζ has not closed,

• The square now closes when the tip of the path gets distance N/ log N
away from ζ.
(This is deﬁned separately for “closed for SLE” and
“closed for LERW”.) It is possible that the square Sζ will be visited
before it is closed; indeed, this is the “typical” behavior if the path
will visit Sζ.

We will work with contents restricted to open squares. Deﬁne

Iζ = c−1∗ 1{ζ ∈ η},

and
ζ = c−1∗ 1{∃k such that ηk = ζ and Sζ is open for LERW at step k − 1}.

5.4 Proof of Theorem 5.1

It remains to prove Lemma 5.8.

Proof of Lemma 5.8. We write ∆Yj = Yj − Yj−1, ∆Bj = Bj − Bj−1, and
∆Mj = Mj − Mj−1. Using the assumptions that Bk is Fk−1-measurable
and Mk is a martingale, we get

We prove the estimates separately for SLE and LERW although the ar-
guments are similar. We start with a simple estimate that uses only the
smoothness of D and the Green’s function for SLE and LERW.
Lemma 6.2. Suppose D is an analytic domain with A = A(N, D). There
exists c < ∞ such that for all δ > 0 the following hold.

1. If Aδ,1 = {ζ ∈ A : SA(ζ; a, b) (cid:54) δ}.

.

2. If Aδ,2 = {ζ ∈ A : dist(ζ, ∂DA) (cid:54) δN }, then

Proof. We use only the Green’s function estimate

1. For ζ that are distance 2−kN to 2−k+1N from a, in order for SA(ζ; a, b) <
δ, the points must be with distance O(δ2−kN) of the boundary. The
number of such points is O(2−2k δ N 2) and the value of E[Θζ + Iζ] for
these points is bounded by O((δ2−kN)−3/4 δ3). Hence the sum over
this region is bounded by 2−5k/4 δ13/4 N 5/4. We can sum over k and
handle points near b similarly.

2. The sum over ζ at distance O(δN) of a or b is O(δ5/4 N 5/4). For
the points that are distance between kδN and (k + 1)δN, there are
O((δN)2) points with typical value of the Green’s function being of or-
der k−3 (δN)−3/4. Hence the sum over that region is O(k−3 δ5/4 N 5/4)
and we can sum over k.

We will consider separately “Type I” and “Type II” closures using the

notation of Deﬁnition 5.3.
Lemma 6.3. There exists c < ∞ such that the following holds. Suppose
D is a simply connected domain containing the origin, and a, b are distinct
boundary points. Let γ be an SLE2 path from a to b in D and let

St = SD(cid:114)γt(0; γ(t), b).

Proof. Let ρ = inf{t : St (cid:54) δ}, and let
Ek = {k − 1 (cid:54) ρ < k},

Vk = {σk < ∞}.

Set k∗ = dse. We will use the strong Markov property at time ρ. We then

The strong Markov property implies that

P(Vs | Ek ∩ Vk−1) (cid:54) c δ3 e3(k−s)/4.

(6.1)
If k = 1, we will use the trivial bound P(E0 ∩ V0) (cid:54) 1. However, for k > 1,
we use

P(Ek ∩ Vk−1) (cid:54) P(Vk−1) (cid:54) c S3

The lemma is obtained by summing over k.

Lemma 6.4. There exists c, q such that the following is true. Suppose
(A, a, b) ∈ A and let δ > 0. In the measure PA,a,b let Ψ be the minimum
of Sk over times k before the ﬁrst visit to the disk of radius δ−q about the
origin. Then,

Proof. This is proved similarly as the previous lemma using (7.3) to justify
the analogue of (6.1). The condition on δ−q is included so that the error
terms in (7.3) are smaller than the dominant term.

In particular, for every stopping time σ and every r > 0,
P{E [QI | Gσ] (cid:62) r} (cid:54) c r−1 (log N)−(3p−1)

Proof. Let σζ be the hitting time of Sζ. The Beurling estimate and Lemma 6.3
with δ = 2 (log N)−p shows that

P{ρζ (cid:54) τζ} (cid:54) P{ρζ (cid:54) σζ} (cid:54) crA(ζ)−3/4 (log N)−3p .

Assume that S(ζ) (cid:62) (log N)−1/3. Then the Green’s function satisﬁes

and consequently, since E [Θζ] =R

Therefore,

There is another term which corresponds to the event σζ < τζ. Given
this event, we need the expected Minkowski content of γ[τζ,∞) ∩ Sζ. Using
Lemma 6.6, we can see that

E [Cont(γ[τζ,∞) ∩ Sζ) | σζ < τζ] = o

Introduction and notation

7 LERW estimates
7.1
In this section we establish some “two-point” estimates about the loop-
erased random walk (LERW) that have independent interest. Because we
are working only with the LERW and not the scaling limit, we will consider
subsets of Z2 rather than of N−1 Z2. We make the convention that all
constants, including implicit constants in O(·) or (cid:16) notation, are assumed
to be universal, that is, do not depend on A, r, a, b, z, w, . . .. We will use the
notation from Section 2.1 and some more that we give now.

57

• Let A denote the set of triples (A, a, b) where A is a ﬁnite, simply con-
nected subset of Z2 containing the origin, and a, b are distinct elements
of ∂eA, the edge boundary of A.

• We identify the edge a with its midpoint and write ea, eb for the di-
rected inward pointing edges which start in ∂A and end in A. We will
write a∗, b∗ ∈ A (rather than a+, b+) for the terminal points of ea, eb.
• If (A, a, b) ∈ A, we let f = fA be the unique conformal transformation

f : DA → D with f(0) = 0, arg f(a) = 0. We set
rA = rA(0) = |f0(0)|−1,
(cid:21)

(cid:20)arg f(b)

SA,a,b = sin

,

2

One can check that these deﬁnitions agree with our previous deﬁnitions
of rA, SA,a,b.

• If r (cid:62) 1, we let Cr denote the discrete open disk of radius r about the

origin,

Cr = {z ∈ Z2 : |z| < r}.

If ζ ∈ Z2, we let Cr(ζ) = Cr + ζ = {z + ζ : z ∈ Cr}.

• Let Ir be the set of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) that include at least
one vertex in Cr. Note that I1 is the set of SAWs that go through the
origin.

• We will sometimes write KA,a,b and WA,a,b for K(A, a, b) and W(A, a, b),

respectively.

• Let Ar be the set of (A, a, b) such that Cr ⊂ A, that is, such that

dist(0, ∂A) (cid:62) r. In particular, A1 = A.

• Let Jr be the set of (A, a, b) ∈ Ar such that a∗, b∗ ∈ Cr. Note that if

(A, a, b) ∈ Jr, then

r (cid:54) dist(0, ∂A) < r + 1,

r − 1 (cid:54) |a∗|,|b∗| < r.

Using the Koebe 1/4-theorem we see that rA (cid:16) r if (A, a, b) ∈ Jr. Also,

we claim that there exists c > 0 such that if (A, a, b) ∈ Jr, then

SA,a,b (cid:62) c

|a − b|

.

(7.1)

One way to prove this is the consider a Brownian motion starting at the ori-
gin and estimating the probability of the event that the path makes clockwise
and counterclockwise loops around a without encircling b. Since we will not
need this estimate, we will not give a full proof. We will, however, need the
following special case which can be proved in this way; we leave the details
to the reader.

• For every δ > 0, there exists cδ = c(δ) > 0 such that if (A, a, b) ∈ Jr

with |a − b| (cid:62) δ r, then

SA,a,b (cid:62) cδ.

(7.2)

We note for interest that the analogous upper bound in (7.1) does not hold.
Using the Beurling estimate, we could show that r SA,a,b (cid:54) c|a − b|1/2 but
we will not need this.

7.2 Loop measure and loop-erased measure
We recall that the loop-erased measure ˆPA,a,b is the ﬁnite measure on WA(a, b)
given by

ˆPA,a,b(V ) = X
X

η∈V

ˆpA,a,b(η),

ˆpA,a,b(η) =

p(ω).

ω∈KA(a,b): LE(ω)=η

where

Also, PA,a,b denotes the corresponding probability measure on WA(a, b) ob-
tained by normalization,

PA,a,b(V ) =

ˆPA,a,b(V )
H∂A(a, b) .

7.3 Statements
We will state the main estimates here leaving some of the proofs until later.
We start by restating the main result from [4].
Theorem 7.1. There exists ˆc ∈ (0,∞) and u > 0 such that if (A, a, b) ∈ A,
then

PA,a,b{0 ∈ η} = ˆc r

A standard technique for estimating the probability of hitting or getting
near a point (for example, the origin) is to observe the path up to the ﬁrst
time it gets within a ﬁxed distance, say r, of the point. We will do something
similar here, except that we will grow the loop-erased walk from both the
beginning and the end. If a path from a to b enters Cr we consider the ﬁrst
and last visits to Cr, that is, the path up to the ﬁrst visit and the reversed
path up to its ﬁrst visit.
To be more precise, recall that Ir denotes the set of SAWs η with η∩Cr 6=
∅. If (A, a, b) ∈ Ar, and η ∈ WA,a,b∩Ir, then there is a unique decomposition

η = η1 ⊕ ˜η ⊕ η2,

where η1 is the initial segment of η stopped at the ﬁrst visit to Cr and
[η2]R is the initial segment of ηR stopped at the ﬁrst visit to Cr. We write
(Ar, ar, br) ∈ Jr, where ar, br are the ﬁnal edges of η1, [η2]R, respectively;
r ∈ Cr are the terminal vertices of η1, [η2]R, respectively; and Ar is the
r, b∗
a∗
connected component of (A (cid:114) [η1 ∪ η2]) ∪ {a∗
r} containing the origin. We
r, b∗
also write Sr = SAr,ar,br; if η 6∈ Ir, we set Sr = 0.

If (A, a, b) ∈ A2r, then we would like to say that

PA,a,b[Ir] := PA,a,b{η ∈ Ir} (cid:16) r3/4 PA,a,b{0 ∈ η},

or equivalently, that

PA,a,b{0 ∈ η | η ∈ Ir} (cid:16) r−3/4.

This will follow from (7.3) provided that with a reasonable probability we
know that Sr is not too small. The technical tool for establishing this is
called a “separation lemma”. We will need to prove a particular version
here, but the basic idea of the proof is similar to other versions (see, e.g.,
[16, 27]). This can be considered as a generalization of a boundary Harnack
principle. Roughly speaking, if we condition a process to get away from
a boundary point by a certain time, then it is unlikely to stay near the
boundary for a long period of time. Indeed, the probability of staying close
to the boundary for a long period of time is much less than the probability
of getting away quickly.
Theorem 7.2 (Separation Lemma). There exists c > 0 such that if (A, a, b) ∈
A2r with PA,a,b(Ir) > 0, then

PA,a,b {Sr (cid:62) c | η ∈ Ir} (cid:62) c.

(7.4)

60

Proof. See Section 7.5. We actually prove that there exists c > 0 such that

PA,a,b {|ar − br| (cid:62) c r | η ∈ Ir} (cid:62) c,

but (7.4) follows immediately from this and (7.2).
Corollary 7.3. If (A, a, b) ∈ A2r, then

PA,a,b{0 ∈ η | η ∈ Ir} (cid:16) r−3/4,

(7.5)

and hence

PA,a,b[Ir] (cid:16) r3/4 PA,a,b{0 ∈ η}.

(7.6)
Proof. Since (Ar, ar, br) ∈ Jr, we know that rAr (cid:16) r, and hence from (7.3),
on the event {η ∈ Ir}, we have

PA,a,b{0 ∈ η | (Ar, a∗

r, b∗

r)} (cid:16) r−3/4 [S3

r + O(r−u)].

Combining this with (7.4) gives (7.5). Since

PA,a,b{0 ∈ η} = PA,a,b[Ir] PA,a,b{0 ∈ η | η ∈ Ir},

we see that (7.6) also follows.

The next lemma is an upper bound for the “two-point Green’s function”,
that is, the probability that LERW visits two points, when the points are
not too close together. We follow with a corollary for points that are close
together. Here we use HA(0, a) for the discrete Poisson kernel, that is, the
probability that a simple random walk starting at 0 exits A along the edge
a. Since HA(0, a) = GA(0, a∗)/4, we can replace HA(0, a) with GA(0, a∗) on
the right-hand side of the estimate of Lemma 7.4. Note that we state this for
the ﬁnite loop-erased measure; the probability is obtained by normalizing
by H∂A(a, b).
Theorem 7.4. There exists c < ∞ such that the following holds. Suppose
1 (cid:54) s (cid:54) r < ∞, (A, a, b) ∈ Ar, and ζ ∈ A with dist(ζ, ∂A) (cid:62) s and
|ζ| (cid:62) r/4. Then

ˆPA,a,b{0, ζ ∈ η} (cid:54) c GA(0, ζ) [HA(0, a) HA(ζ, b) + HA(0, b) HA(ζ, a)]

.

Proof. See Section 7.6. We actually show the slightly stronger result that
the ˆP-measure of paths in WA,a,b that visit 0 ﬁrst and then ζ is bounded
above by a constant times

r3/4 s3/4

GA(0, ζ) HA(0, a) HA(ζ, b)

r3/4 s3/4

.

Corollary 7.5. There exists c < ∞ such that the following holds. Suppose
(A, a, b) ∈ Ar, and |ζ| (cid:54) r/4. Then,

PA,a,b{ζ ∈ η | 0 ∈ η} (cid:54) c|ζ|−3/4.
Proof. Let s = 2|ζ| (cid:54) r/2. Corollary 7.3 implies that

PA,a,b{η ∈ Is} (cid:16) s3/4 PA,a,b{0 ∈ η},

We also claim that

PA,a,b{0, ζ ∈ η | η ∈ Is} (cid:54) c s−3/2.

(7.7)

Indeed, we now show that there exists c such that for all (A0, a0, b0) ∈ Js,

PA0,a0,b0{0, ζ ∈ η} (cid:54) c s−3/2.

(7.8)

To see this, we ﬁrst note that GA0(0, ζ) (cid:16) 1 and

PA0,a0,b0{0, ζ ∈ η} = H∂A0(a0, b0)−1 ˆP{0, ζ ∈ η}

Also, the Harnack inequality implies that HA0(0, a0) (cid:16) HA0(ζ, a0), HA0(0, b0) (cid:16)
HA0(ζ, b0). Hence (7.8) will follow from Lemma 7.4 provided we show that

HA0(0, a0) HA0(0, b0) (cid:54) c H∂A0(a0, b0).

For this, we will show that the left-hand side of the last display is comparable
to the p-measure of walks from a0 to b0 staying in A0 that intersect Cs/2, which
is obviously bounded above by H∂A0(a0, b0). To ﬁnish the proof, split any
such walk ω as ω = ω1 ⊕ ω2 where ω1 is stopped at the ﬁrst time that the
walk reaches a point in Cs/2. Given ω1, the measure of the set of choices for
ω2 is HA0(w, b0) where w is the endpoint of ω1. By the Harnack inequality,
we know that for each such w, HA0(w, b0) (cid:16) HA0(0, b0). The reversal of any
random walk path starting at 0 stopped when it leaves A0 at a0 can similarly
be written as ω1 ⊕ ω3 where ω1 is as above and ω3 is a walk from w to 0.
For each w, the measure of choices for ω3 is GA0(w, 0) (cid:16) 1 and hence the
measure of the set of acceptable ω1 is comparable to HA0(0, a0).

7.4 Estimates for analytic domains
In this section we discuss various estimates under the assumption that the
domain we consider is analytic. We ﬁrst consider second moment bounds on
the number of steps in a LERW. We will derive some consequences of the

62

estimates stated in Section 7.3. The issue is that the estimates given there
are not very sharp near the boundary in general. Here we will show that
the estimates are good enough if the discrete sets are suﬃciently “nice”: we
will assume they approximate an analytic domain.
For the remainder of this subsection we ﬁx a simply connected domain
D with 0 ∈ D ⊂ D with analytic boundary ∂D and two distinct boundary
points a0, b0 ∈ ∂D. We emphasize that all constants in this subsection, either
explicit or implicit, are allowed to depend on D, a0, b0. Let f : D → D be the
unique conformal transformation with f(0) = 0, f(a0) = 1. Recall that the
analyticity assumption means that f extends to a conformal transformation
of a neighborhood of D. In particular, |f0| is uniformly bounded above and
away from 0 on D.

For each n = 1, 2, . . ., let An be the connected component containing the

origin of the lattice set

and let Dn = n−1 DAn. Note that Dn ⊂ D is a simply connected domain
and that every point on ∂Dn is at distance O(n−1) from ∂D. Therefore,
since |f0| is bounded above, there exists c1 = c1(D) < ∞ such that for all n,

{z ∈ Z2 : Sz ⊂ nD},

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
1 − c1
n

D ⊂ f(Dn) ⊂ D.

Also, (diam An)/rAn (cid:16) 1. We let an, bn be points in ∂eAn (considered as
points in ∂DAn) that are closest to na0, nb0. (If there are ties for “closest”
we can choose arbitrarily.) We will write Pn for PAn,an,bn. If z ∈ An, we
write

δ(z) = δAn(z) = min{|z − an|,|z − bn|},

and

dz = dz,An = dist(z, ∂An).

in particular, dz (cid:16)
We will assume that dz (cid:62) δ(z)/20, dw (cid:62) δ(w)/20;
δ(z), dw (cid:16) δ(w).
If this is not the case, we can add the disk of radius
δ(z)/20 about z and the disk of radius δ(w)/20 about w to An. Clearly
this only increases ˆPAn,a,b{z, w ∈ η} and it is not diﬃcult to see that this
increases H∂An(a, b) by at most a universal multiplicative constant. Hence,
this would increase Pn{z, w ∈ η} by at most a multiplicative constant.

Our ﬁrst goal is to prove the following two-point estimate.

Proposition 7.6. For every (D, a0, b0) as above, with ∂D analytic, there
exists c < ∞ such that if z, w ∈ An with z 6= w and δ(z) (cid:54) δ(w), then

Pn{z, w ∈ η} (cid:54) c δ(z)−3/4 h

δ(w)−3/4 + |z − w|−3/4i

.

(7.9)

63

The proof uses the following facts that we will not prove; see []. These
estimates can be considered versions of the well-known gambler’s ruin esti-
mate for random walk and strongly use the fact that the boundary of D is
smooth and hence locally looks like a straight line.
Lemma 7.7. For every (D, a0, b0) as above, with ∂D analytic, there exists
c < ∞ such that

c−1 (cid:54) n2 H∂An(an, bn) (cid:54) c.

Moreover, if z ∈ An, Sj is a simple random walk starting at z, and τ =
τAn = min{j : Sj 6∈ An}, then

Pz {diam(S[0, τ]) (cid:62) r dist(z, ∂An)} (cid:54) c
r

.

Proof of Proposition 7.6. Combining the estimates in Lemma 7.7, we ﬁrst
claim that

HAn(z, an) (cid:54)

cdz

|z − an|2 .

(7.10)

To see this, think of the right-hand side as the product of two terms. The
probability starting at z of getting to distance |z− an|/2 without leaving An
is bounded above by cdz/|z − an|. Given that the walker succeeds in doing
this, since (diam An)/rAn (cid:16) 1 and ∂D analytic, the probability of leaving
An at an is comparable to 1/|z − an|. We can write (7.10) as

HAn(z, an)

3/4
d
z

(cid:54) c

|z − an|2 ,

and similarly for HAn(w, bn)/d

3/4
w . We also claim that

GAn(z, w) (cid:54) c

dz dw
|z − w|2 .

To prove this, we can view the right-hand side as the product of three
terms. The probability that a walk starting at z moves distance |z − w|/4
without leaving An is comparable to 1 ∧ (dz/|z − w|) and similarly for a
random walk starting at w. Given that both of these happen, the expected
number of visits to the other point is O(1). Combining the last two displayed
inequalities, we get

HAn(z, an) HAn(w, bn) GAn(z, w)

(7.11)

Note that the left-hand side of (7.11) corresponds to one of the two terms
in the upper bound of Lemma 7.4; the other is obtained by interchanging z
and w. We will derive (7.9) from (7.11) using Lemma 7.4. There are several
cases to consider.

Case 1. |z − w| (cid:62) dz/4. In this case, we will bound the left-hand side

of (7.9) by c δ(z)−3/4 δ(w)−3/4.

We claim that the right-hand side of (7.11) satisﬁes

w

|z − an|2 |w − bn|2 |z − w|2

(cid:54)

c

n2 δ(z)3/4 δ(w)3/4 .

To see this, we ﬁrst note that the triangle inequality implies that at least
one of the following must hold: |z − w| (cid:62) |an − bn|/2, |z − an| (cid:62) |an − bn|/4,
or |w − bn| (cid:62) |an − bn|/4. Also, we know that |an − bn| (cid:62) cn.

• If |z− w| (cid:62) |an− bn|/2, then |z− w| (cid:62) c n. Since δ(z) (cid:62) dz, δ(w) (cid:62) dw,
and, by deﬁnition |z − an| (cid:62) δ(z), |w − bn| (cid:62) δ(w), the claim holds.
• If |w − bn| (cid:62) |an − bn|/4, then |w − bn| (cid:62) cn. We also have |z − an| (cid:62)

δ(z) (cid:16) dz and that |z − w| (cid:62) dz/4.

z

Note that Pn{z ∈ η} (cid:54) c d
, so if dz (cid:62) δ(z)/4 we are done. Otherwise,
if dz (cid:54) δ(z)/4, we can improve this estimate by considering the probability
that a random walk in An from an to bn reaches the disk of radius dz/2
about z without exiting An. Using the analyticity of D, this probability
is comparable to dz/δ(z). This gives an upper bound for the probability
that the loop-erased walk hits this set. Given that the walk hits this set,
the probability that the loop-erased walk reaches z is bounded above by a
−3/4
constant times d

Pn{z ∈ η} (cid:54) c (dz/δ(z)) d−3/4

(This bound is not sharp for z near the boundary but will suﬃce for our
purposes.)

We consider now the number of steps in a LERW running in an approx-

imation of D. Let

be the number of steps inside a ball of radius r about ζ. Finally we deﬁne
the associated maximal function

T(r) = Tn,D,a0,b0(r) = max {T(r; ζ) : ζ ∈ An}

which is important for our main argument. We will estimate the second
moments of these random variables.
Proposition 7.8. For every (D, a0, b0) as above, with ∂D analytic, there
exists c < ∞ such that for every 0 < r (cid:54) 1 and ζ ∈ An,

7.5 Separation lemma: proof of Theorem 7.2
In this section we will prove Theorem 7.2. The proof spans the whole section.
As a start we state a lemma about simple random walk. Suppose we start
a random walk at z ∈ ∂iCr and s < r. Consider the ﬁrst time that the
random walk gets distance s from z. Then it is easy to see (for example, by
comparison with Brownian motion) that there exists c > 0 (independent of
z, s, r) such that with probability at least c, the random walker stops within
distance r−(s/3) of the origin. Now suppose that A ⊃ Cr and we condition
that the walk stays in A before it reaches distance s. If anything, this should
push the random walker closer to the origin and hence there should be a
uniform lower bound on the probability of being within distance r − (s/3).
The next lemma states that this intuition is correct, and we can ﬁnd a
constant that is independent of r, s, z, A. For a proof of the ﬁrst statement,
see [27, Proposition 3.5]; the second is done similarly, and, in fact, is slightly
easier.
Lemma 7.9. There exists c > 0 such that the following holds.

• Suppose s < r, Cr ⊂ A and z ∈ ∂iCr. Let S be a simple random walk

starting at z and let

τ = τA = min{j : Sj 6∈ A},

σ = σs = min{j : |Sj − S0| (cid:62) s}.

P{|Sσ| (cid:54) r − (s/3) | σ < τ} (cid:62) c.

Then,

• Suppose s < r and Z2 (cid:114) Cr ⊂ A and z ∈ ∂Cr. Let S be a simple

random walk starting at z and let

τ = τA = min{j : Sj 6∈ A},

σ = σs = min{j : |Sj − S0| (cid:62) s}.

P{|Sσ| (cid:54) r + (s/3) | σ < τ} (cid:62) c.

Then,

If (A, a, b) ∈ Jr, we deﬁne ea(A, a, b) to be the probability that a simple
random walk starting at a∗ reaches distance |a∗ − b∗|/3 from a∗ without
leaving A. We deﬁne

e(A, a, b) = ea(A, a, b) eb(A, b, a).

68

Lemma 7.10. There exists 0 < c1 < c2 < ∞ such that the following holds.
Suppose (A, a, b) ∈ Jr. Then

c1 e(A, a, b) (cid:54) H∂A(a, b) (cid:54) c2 e(A, a, b).

Moreover, the p-measure of the set of walks in KA(a, b) of diameter less than
c2 |a∗ − b∗| is at least c1 H∂A(a, b).

The last assertion can be rephrased as saying that the probability that
an excursion from a to b in A has diameter less than c2 |a∗ − b∗| is at least
c1.
Proof. Let s = |a∗ − b∗|/3. It suﬃces to prove the result for s suﬃciently
large (for small s one can give a direct proof, which we omit, by constructing
speciﬁc paths).
Let ha(z) = hA,a(z) be the probability that a random walk starting at
a∗ reaches distance s from a∗ without exiting A and that the ﬁrst point
at distance s that it hits is z. That is, using the notation of the previous
lemma,

ha(z) = Pa∗{σs < τA, S(σs) = z}.

We deﬁne hb(w) similarly, and note that (for s large enough)

4H∂A(a, b) = GA(a∗, b∗) = X

ha(z) hb(w) GA(z, w),

(z,w)∈U

where U denotes the set of (z, w) with s (cid:54) |z−a∗| < s+1, s (cid:54) |w−b∗| < s+1.
Using simple connectedness of A, it is not hard to verify that GA(z, w) (cid:54) c2
for all such (z, w) ∈ U; and if (z, w) ∈ U ∩ (Cr−(s/3) × Cr−(s/3)), then
GA(z, w) (cid:62) c1. Note thatX

ha(z) hb(w) = e(A, a, b),

(z,w)∈U

and Lemma 7.9 implies thatX

ha(z) hb(w) (cid:62) c e(A, a, b).

z,w∈Cr−(s/3)

Taken together these estimates give the ﬁrst assertion. For the second as-
sertion, we consider the set

V = {ζ ∈ Cr : |ζ − a∗| (cid:54) 4s}

69

and show that

H∂V (a, b) (cid:62) cH∂A(a, b).

Indeed, one can easily check that there is a constant c0 > 0 such that (z, w) ∈
U ∩ (Cr−(s/3) × Cr−(s/3)) implies

Consequently,

4H∂V (a, b) = X

(z,w)∈U

GV (z, w) (cid:62) c0.

ha(z)hb(w)GV (z, w) (cid:62) c0 X

z,w∈Cr−(s/3)

ha(z)hb(w).

But we have already shown that the last term is comparable to H∂A(a, b).

The next lemma is easy but important. If gives a lower bound on the
probability that the LERW grown simultaneously from a, b reaches Cr−4|a−b|
and that at this time the distance of the endpoints has been increased by a
factor of two.
Lemma 7.11. There exists c > 0 such that if (A, a, b) ∈ Jr, and s =
|a − b| (cid:54) r/10, then
PA,a,b

r−4s| (cid:62) 2|a∗ − b∗|}(cid:3) (cid:62) c.

(cid:2)Ir−4s ∩ {|a∗

r−4s − b∗

Sketch of proof. As in the previous proof we ﬁrst consider a random walk up
to the time that it gets distance s/3 from a and b. We consider (z, w) ∈ U
and consider random walk paths from z to w whose loop-erasure will stay
in Cr−4s and satisfy |a∗
r−4s| (cid:62) 2|a∗ − b∗|. We could give a speciﬁc
event, but we leave this to the reader.

r−4s − b∗

In order to prove separation of the LERW, it is useful to consider an event
deﬁned in terms of the random walk from a to b in A. Suppose (A, a, b) ∈ Js
with 3r/2 (cid:54) s (cid:54) 2r. Consider the set of random walk paths

ω = [ω0, ω1, . . . , ωn−1, ωn] ∈ KA(a∗, b∗),

satisfying the following conditions.

• ω ∩ Cr 6= ∅.
• ω ∩ Cr ⊂ {x + iy : |y| (cid:54) r/10}.

70

• Let j−, j+, k−, k+, l−, l+ be the ﬁrst and last visits to Cr ∩ {Re (z) <

−r/3}, Cr ∩ {Re (z) = 0}, Cr ∩ {Re (z) > r/3}, respectively. Then

0 < j− (cid:54) j+ (cid:54) k− (cid:54) k+ (cid:54) l− (cid:54) l+ < n.

Implicit in this condition is the fact that ω visits all three of Cr ∩
{Re (z) < −r/3}, Cr ∩ {Re (z) = 0}, Cr ∩ {Re (z) > r/3}. Note that if
r (cid:62) 3, then we would also have j+ < k−, k+ < l−.

•

[ω0, . . . , ωj+] ∩ [ωk−, . . . , ωn] = ∅.

In particular, the walk ω enters Cr ∩ {x + iy : |y| (cid:54) r/10} from the left
and leaves from the right. We let Jr be the set of ω such that either ω or
the reversal of ω satisﬁes the conditions above. An important fact that is
easy to verify is the following:

• If ω ∈ Jr, then LE(ω) ∈ Jr.
With the aid of Lemma 7.9 and the invariance principle (by considering
an appropriate event for Brownian motion and approximating by random
walk), it is not hard to show the following.
Lemma 7.12. For every δ > 0, there exists cδ > 0, such that if (A, a, b) ∈ Js
with 3r/2 (cid:54) s (cid:54) r and |a − b| (cid:62) δ r, then

PA,a,b(Jr) (cid:62) cδ.

(7.14)

We emphasize that the constant cδ depends strongly on δ and goes to
zero with δ. The separation lemma is established by showing that there
exists c > 0 such that if (A, a, b) ∈ K2r, then

PA,a,b(Jr | Ir) (cid:62) c.

Here the constant is independent of δ but we are only estimating a condi-
tional probability.
To prove the separation lemma, we start with (Au, au, bu) ∈ Ju where u

is a positive integer, and consider the (reverse time) subMarkov chain

(Au, au, bu), (Au−1, au−1, bu−1), (Au−2, au−2, bu−2), . . . .

induced by the measure Pu := PAu,au,bu. It is a subMarkov chain because
the process is killed at step k on the event Ik+1 (cid:114) Ik. It stops at (A1, a1, b1);

71

the path is still “alive” at that time if and only if 0 ∈ η. The path is growing
at both the front and the back. The domain Markov property implies that on
the event Is, the conditional distribution of the reminder of the loop-erased
walk is given by PAs,as,bs. Let

σδ = σδ,u = min{k : |au−k − bu−k| (cid:62) δ}.

We claim that it suﬃces to show the following:

• There exists 0 < ε < 1/4 such that if (A, a, b) ∈ K2r, then

PA,a,b {σεr (cid:54) r/2 | Ir} (cid:62) ε.

(7.15)

Indeed, if we have this, since Jr ⊂ Ir, (7.14) and the domain Markov prop-
erty imply that

PA,a,b {Jr | Ir} (cid:62) ε cε.

In order to establish (7.15) we prove the following.
• There exists c < ∞, β > 0 such that if (A, a, b) ∈ Ju with 3r/2 (cid:54) u (cid:54)

2r and |a − b| (cid:62) 2−m−1, then

n
σ2−m (cid:62) m2 2−m | Ir

o (cid:62) c e−βm.

PA,a,b

Indeed, using P m22−m < ∞, continued use of (7.16) and the domain

Markov property gives (7.15) for suﬃciently small ε. To get (7.16) one
shows two estimates,

hn

PA,a,b[Ir] (cid:62) c1 e−βm,

σ2−m (cid:62) m2 2−mo ∩ Ir

i (cid:54) c2 e−2βm,

PA,a,b

(7.16)

(7.17)
(7.18)

for some c1, c2.
For (7.17), we can actually prove the stronger estimate ˆPA,a,b[Ir] (cid:62)
c1 e−βm. To see this, we can either use “cone” estimates for random walk
or just repeated application of Lemma 7.11. For (7.18), we use the ﬁnal
assertion of Lemma 7.10 to see that if |a− b| (cid:54) 2−m, then there is a positive
probability that that random walk will not hit Cu−k2−m for some k. By
iterating this, we can see that in O(m2) attempts, except for an event of
probability exp{−O(m2)} = o(e−2βm) the random path will either fail to
proceed another distance k2−m inward or the endpoints will get more than
distance 2−m apart.

7.6 Correlation estimate: proof of Theorem 7.4
In this section we prove Theorem 7.4. The proof spans the whole section.
Given (A, a, b) and 0, ζ ∈ A, let us write {a → 0 → ζ → b} for the event
that the LERW η from a to b ﬁrst goes through 0 and then later through ζ.
Our goal is to show that

ˆPA,a,b{a → 0 → ζ → b} (cid:54) c G(0, ζ) HA(0, a) HA(ζ, b)

r3/4 s3/4

.

(7.19)

Once we have this, we can conclude the proof of Lemma 7.4 by interchanging
the role of a and b. Before going through the details, let us quickly sketch
the idea to show where the terms on the right-hand side come from. If η is
a SAW from a to b going through 0 and then ζ, we can write η uniquely as

η = η− ⊕ η0 ⊕ ˜η ⊕ ηζ ⊕ η+

where η0 is a SAW starting and ending on ∂Cr/40 and otherwise staying
in Cr/40, and going through 0. Similarly, ηζ is a SAW starting and end-
ing on ∂Cr/40(ζ), staying in Cr/40(ζ), and going through ζ. By Theorem
7.1, the measure of possible choices for η0, ηζ are O(r−3/4) and O(s−3/4),
respectively. Making this precise is what requires most of the work in this
section. In particular, we will have to be able to compare several diﬀerent
loop-erased measures on walks in the discs around 0, ζ.
We then have to multiply by the measure of possible choices for η−, ˜η, η+
and this gives terms of HA(0, a), G(0, ζ), HA(ζ, b), respectively. Our argu-
ments do not use the fact that there are avoidance constraints for the paths
η−, ˜η, η+, and this is why we only get an upper bound. If 0, ζ are in the
interior, then our bound tends to be correct up to a multiplicative constant,
while if 0 or ζ is near the boundary, our estimate is not sharp (but does
suﬃce for the needs in this paper).

We start by focusing on the SAW η0.
• If A is a ﬁnite simply connected subset of Z2 containing the origin and
a ∈ ∂eA, we let WA,0,a denote the set of SAWs starting at the origin,
ending with a, and otherwise staying in A. We write ˆPA,0,a for the
usual loop-erased measure on such paths (with total mass HA(0, a))
and PA,0,a for the normalized probability measure.

• We write W0,r for the set of SAWs starting at the origin, ending on

∂Cr and otherwise in Cr. In other words,

W0,r = [

a∈∂eCr

WCr,0,a.

73

If η ∈ W0,r, we write η∗ for the terminal vertex, that is, the point in
∂Cr at which the walk terminates.

We will consider several related probability measures on W0,r.

• The ﬁrst corresponds to the usual LERW in the disk Cr stopped at
the boundary: take simple random walk starting at the origin, stop
the walk when it reaches ∂Cr, and then erase the loops. We will write
πr for the induced probability measure on paths, for which we know
that [20, (9.5)]

πr(η) = 4−|η| Fη(Cr).

(7.20)
Here |η| denotes the number of steps of η and log Fη(Cr) is the random
walk loop measure of loops in Cr that intersect η. Here we use the
(rooted) loop measure m deﬁned by m(l) = |l|−1 4−|l| for each rooted
loop l with |l| > 0 (we could also use the unrooted loop measure, but
to be deﬁnite we will choose the rooted measure).

• More generally, if Cr ⊂ A, we write πr,A for the probability measure on
W0,r obtained by starting a simple random walk at the origin, stopping
when it reaches ∂A, erasing loops, and then considering the resulting
SAW up to the ﬁrst visit of Cr. We write πr,s for πr,Cs. Under this
deﬁnition, πr = πr,r. As in (7.20), we can write
πr,A(η) = 4−|η| Fη(A) eA(η),

is the (escape) probability that a simple random walk starting at η∗
reaches ∂A without returning to η and by deﬁnition

eA(η; a) = H∂(A(cid:114)η)(η∗, a).

By deﬁnition, eA(η) = 1 if η∗ ∈ ∂A.

• Similarly, if a ∈ ∂A, we write πr,A,a(η) for the corresponding proba-
bility law obtained as in the previous bullet if we replace the simple
random walk with a random walk h-process conditioned to leave A at
a. In this case,

πr,A,a(η) = 4−|η| Fη(A) eA(η; a) HA(0, a)−1.

(7.21)

74

where

eA(η) = H∂(A(cid:114)η)(η∗, ∂A) = X

eA(η; a)

a∈∂A

The measures πr and πr,A can be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent especially at the
terminal point of the walk. However, as we show in the next lemma, the
measures πr,A and πr,A,a are comparable to πr,2r provided that C2r ⊂ A.
Lemma 7.13. There exist 0 < c1 < c2 < ∞ such that if C2r ⊂ A and
a ∈ ∂A, then for all η ∈ W0,r,

c1 πr,2r(η) (cid:54) πr,A,a(η) (cid:54) c2 πr,2r(η),
c1 πr,2r(η) (cid:54) πr,A(η) (cid:54) c2 πr,2r(η).

Proof. We will prove the ﬁrst displayed expression which will imply the
second since

πr,A(η) = X

a∈∂A

HA(0, a) πr,A,a(η).

Since each πr,A,a is a probability measure, it suﬃces to ﬁnd functions vr, qr
such that πr,A,a factorizes up to constants:

πr,A,a(η) (cid:16) vr(η) qr(A).

(7.22)

Note that vr depends only on η and r while qr depends only on A and r.
that hits 0 intersects every η ∈ W0,r, we get that

Recalling that F{0}(A) = GA(0, 0) and using the fact that every loop

πr,A,a(η) = GA(0, 0) 4−|η| Fη(A (cid:114) {0}) eA(η; a) HA(0, a)−1.

From this we see that it is enough to factorize Fη(A (cid:114) {0}) and eA(η; a).
Z2 (cid:114) {0} that intersect Cr into three sets:

We start by looking at Fη(A (cid:114) {0}). We ﬁrst partition the loops in

• L0
• L1

r: loops that lie entirely in C2r (cid:114) {0};
r: loops in Z2 (cid:114) {0} that do not lie entirely in C2r and disconnect 0
from ∂Cr;
r : loops in Z2 (cid:114) {0} that do not lie entirely in C2r and do not
disconnect 0 from ∂Cr.

• L2

We then write

where

Fη(A (cid:114) {0}) =

λj(η, A) = expn

m{‘ ∈ Lj

λj(η; A),

2Y
r : ‘ ⊂ A (cid:114) {0}, ‘ ∩ η 6= ∅}o

j=0

.

75

Clearly, λ0(η; A) = λ0(η; Cr) for all A ⊃ Cr, so it depends only on r, η.

If η ∈ W0,r and ‘ ∈ L1

λ1(η; A) = λ1(Cr; A) = expn

r, then ‘ ∩ η 6= ∅. Hence,

r : ‘ ⊂ A (cid:114) {0}, ‘ ∩ Cr 6= ∅}o

,

m{‘ ∈ L1

which depends only on r and A.

In [20, Lemma 11.3.3] it is proved that exists c < ∞ such that for each
r) (cid:54) c. Indeed, the proof gives a stronger fact: there exists c < ∞
r, m(L2
such that for each r and each positive integer k, the loop measure of loops in
C(k+2)r that do not lie entirely in C(k+1)r and do not disconnect 0 from ∂Cr

is O(k−2). Since λ2(η; A) (cid:54) exp(cid:8)m(L2

r)(cid:9), this implies that λ2(η; A) (cid:16) 1.

Combining these estimates, we see that for all η ∈ W0,r,

Fη(A (cid:114) {0})
Fη(C2r (cid:114) {0}) (cid:16) λ1(Cr; A)
λ1(Cr; C2r) .

Note that the right-hand side depends only on r, A. This gives the desired
factorization of Fη(A (cid:114) {0}).
It remains to consider eA(η; a). Using the Harnack inequality and Lemma
7.9, we can see that eC3r/2(η) (cid:16) eC2r(η) and for every A ⊃ C2r and a ∈ ∂A,

eA(η; a) (cid:16) eC3r/2(η) HA(0, a).

Combining all of this, we see that

πr,A,a(η) (cid:16) h4−|η| eC3r/2(η) Fη(C2r (cid:114) {0})i h

GA(0, 0) λ1(Cr; A) λ1(Cr; C2r)−1i

.

This gives (7.22).

Given η ∈ W0,r, we let hr(η) denote the (conditional) non-intersection
probability that a simple random walk starting at the origin reaches ∂Cr
without returning to η. An immediate consequence of Theorem 7.1, specif-
ically the up-to-constants version stated in (7.3), is the following.
Proposition 7.14. There exist 0 < c1 < c2 < ∞ such that

c1 r−3/4 (cid:54) Eπr[hr(η)] (cid:54) c2 r−3/4.

We will need the corresponding upper bound for the other measures.

(The lower bound also holds but we will not need this.)
Proposition 7.15. There exists c < ∞ such that if A ∈ A2r and a ∈ ∂eA,
then

Eπr,A,a[hr(η)] (cid:54) c r−3/4.

(7.23)

76

Proof. By Lemma 7.13, it suﬃces to show that
Eπr,2r[hr(η)] (cid:54) c r−3/4.

We ﬁx an ε > 0 such that the following holds.

• Suppose that r (cid:62) 1 and Sj is a simple random walk starting at z
with |z| (cid:54) εr and let T = Tr/4 be the ﬁrst j with |Sj| (cid:62) r/4. Then
the probability that S[0, T − 1] disconnects 0 from ∂Cr/4 is at least
.99. (By disconnection we mean that if ˜S is another simple random
walk starting at the origin independent of S, then the probability that
˜S visits S[0, T − 1] before reaching ∂Cr/4 is one. By deﬁnition, if
0 ∈ S[0, T − 1], then S[0, T − 1] disconnects.)

To show that such an ε exists, we ﬁrst ﬁnd an ε, r0 such that this holds
for r (cid:62) r0 by the invariance principle. Once we have this we can prove it
for all r by choosing perhaps a smaller ε so that ε r0 (cid:54) 1/2. In this case if
r < r0, then |z| (cid:54) εr implies that z = 0. If 0 ∈ S[0, T −1], then by deﬁnition
S[0, T − 1] disconnects.
Let η ∈ W0,r; we will assume that η has the distribution πr,2r. Let
ω denote a random walk path started uniformly on {±1,±i} and stopped
when in reaches ∂Cr and we write Pω for the probability law of ω. We write
ω∗ for the terminal point of ω. Note that

hr(η) = Pω{η ∩ ω = ∅}.

We let

r(η) = Pω{η ∩ ω = ∅; dist(ω∗, η) (cid:62) ε r}.
h∗
The deﬁnition of h∗
r depends on ε, but since we have ﬁxed ε we will not
include it in the notation. We claim the following.

• There exists δ > 0 such that

Eπ2r,2r[h2r] (cid:62) δ Eπr,2r[h∗
r].

(7.24)

To see this, we ﬁrst note that in the measure π2r,2r the conditional distribu-
tion of the remainder of the path given η, the SAW up to the ﬁrst visit to
∂Cr, can be obtained by starting a random walk at the endpoint η condi-
tioned to reach ∂C2r without returning to η and then erasing loops. Using
Lemma 7.9, we can see that in this conditioned distribution that there is a
positive probability ρ that this conditioned simple random walk (and hence

77

also its loop-erasure) stays in C2r (cid:114) Cr−(rε/5) and that its argument does
not vary by more than ε/10. We get similar estimates for the extension of
the random walk ω to ∂C2r.
From (7.24) and Proposition 7.14, we see that there exists c < ∞ such
that for all s (cid:62) 2r,

(7.25)
For each nonnegative integer k, we let ηk, ωk be the initial segments of

these paths stopped at the ﬁrst visit to ∂Cr/2k. We deﬁne the events

Eπr,s[h∗

r] (cid:54) c r−3/4.

Uk =n

ηk ∩ ωk = ∅o

,

Vk =ndist(ηk, ωk∗) (cid:62) ε 2−k r

o

.

(7.26)

Here ε is as deﬁned above. Using (7.25), we see that
P[Uk ∩ Vk] (cid:54) c (r/2k)−3/4.

We want to prove that P [U0] (cid:54) cr−3/4. Note that by the deﬁnition of ε,

so that

P[Uk−1 | (ηk, ωk)] (cid:54) 1Uk [1Vk + (.01) 1V c

k

],

P[Uk−1 ∩ V c

k | (ηk, ωk)] (cid:54) (.01)1Uk .

By iterating this and recalling that Uk are increasing events in k, we see
that

P[U0 ∩ V c1 ∩ ··· ∩ V c

k−1 | (ηk, ωk)] (cid:54) (.01)k−1 1Uk .

Hence

P(cid:2)U0 ∩ V c1 ∩ V c2 ··· ∩ V c

k−1 ∩ Vk

(cid:3) (cid:54) (.01)k−1 P[Uk ∩ Vk].

We can write

U0 ⊂ [U0 ∩ V c1 ∩ V c2 ··· ∩ V c

k0] ∪

 k0[

k=1

(U0 ∩ V c1 ∩ V c2 ··· ∩ V c

k−1 ∩ Vk)

 ,

where k0 = k0
We therefore get

r is deﬁned to be the smallest integer k such that (.01)k (cid:54) r−3/4.

P[U0] (cid:54) r−3/4 +

k0X

k=1

(.01)k−1 P[Uk ∩ Vk].

and the lemma follows by summing, using (7.26).

78

We are now ready to establish (7.19). Let r0 = r/40, s0 = s/40. Let
Γ∗ denote the set of nearest neighbor paths ω in KA(a, b) that visit both 0
and ζ and such that the last visit to ζ occurs after the last visit to 0. Each
ω ∈ Γ∗ has a unique decomposition

ω = [ω1]R ⊕ ˜ω ⊕ ω2,

(7.27)

where:

• ω1 is a nearest neighbor path starting at 0 leaving A at a.
• ω2 is a nearest neighbor path starting at ζ in A (cid:114) {0} leaving A (cid:114) {0}

at b.

• ˜ω is a nearest neighbor path starting at 0, ending at ζ, and otherwise

staying in A (cid:114) {0, ζ}.

Let Γ be the set of ω ∈ Γ∗ such that in the decomposition above,

ω2 ∩ LE(ω1) = ∅,

˜ω0 ∩ [LE(ω1) ∪ LE(ω2)] = ∅.

Here ˜ω0 is ˜ω with the initial and terminal vertices removed. If ω ∈ Γ, we
deﬁne the SAW

η = [LE(ω1)]R ⊕ LE(˜ω) ⊕ LE(ω2).

Note that η ∈ WA(a, b) and η visits 0 before visiting ζ. Moreover, for any
such η, the measure of the set of ω such that η is produced is 4−|η| Fη(A),
that is, we get the usual LERW measure.
In particular, we can see that
ˆPA,a,b{a → 0 → ζ → b} equals the measure of Γ.

To give an upper bound on the measure of Γ, we reﬁne the decomposition

(7.27) by writing

˜ω = ˜ω1 ⊕ ˜ω0 ⊕ [˜ω2]R,

where

• ˜ω1 is a path starting at 0 stopped when it reaches ∂Cr0.
• ˜ω2 is a path starting at ζ stopped when it reaches ∂Cs0(ζ).
• ˜ω0 is a path starting at the terminal point of ˜ω1 and ending at the

terminal point of ˜ω2.

79

We let Γ0 be the set of paths ω ∈ Γ∗ such that

• (˜ω1)o ∩ LE(ω1) = ∅, where (˜ω1)o denotes ˜ω1 with the initial vertex

removed.

• (˜ω2)o ∩ LE(ω2) = ∅,

Note that Γ ⊂ Γ0. To estimate the measure of Γ0 we see that

• The measure of possible ω1 is HA(0, a).
• The measure of possible ω2 is HA(ζ, b).
• Using Proposition 7.15, we see that the probability that (˜ω1)0 avoids

LE(ω1) is O(r−3/4).

• Similarly, the probability that (˜ω2)0 avoids LE(ω2) is O(s−3/4).
• Given ˜ω1, ˜ω2, with terminal vertices z, w, respectively the measure of
paths in A starting at z and ending at w is GA(z, w). Using the discrete
Harnack inequality we see that this is comparable to GA(0, ζ).
By combining these bounds, the proof of Theorem 7.4 is complete.

7.7 Estimates of bottleneck events
We will need an estimate that shows that the LERW path does not have
too many “bottlenecks”; that is, that it is unlikely for LERW to get near a
point, then get far away, and then subsequently get even closer.
Proposition 7.16. There exist c < ∞ such that the following holds. Sup-
pose 0 < r < R and (A, a, b) ∈ Ar with |a∗| < r. Let E0 denote the set
of η = [η0, . . . , ηn] ∈ WA(a, b) such that there exists 0 < j < k < n, with
|ηj| (cid:62) R,|ηk| (cid:54) r. Then

(cid:8)E0(cid:9) (cid:54) c (r/R).

(7.28)
Proposition 7.16 is an immediate corollary of Lemma 7.17 which is the

PA,a,b

corresponding statement for random walk excursions.
Remark. The proof of Lemma 7.17 (with an obvious modiﬁcation) yields an
estimate similar to (7.28) for the event that the path twice goes from radius
r to R and returns to radius r. The only diﬀerence is that the probability of
this event is O((r/R)2). This “6-arm” estimate leads to a suﬃcient regularity
estimate for LERW which can be used to prove convergence of the (chordal)
LERW path to the SLE2 path parametrized by capacity from the coupling
of Section 4, see [26].

By analogy with SLE2, we conjecture that this lemma can be strength-
ened so that (r/R) is replaced by (r/R)3/2 where 3/2 = (8/κ − 1)/2. We
have not proved the stronger result, but this lemma suﬃces for our purposes.
Lemma 7.17. There exist c < ∞ such that the following holds. Suppose
0 < r < R and (A, a, b) ∈ Ar with |a∗| < r. Let E denote the set of
ω = [ω0, . . . , ωn] ∈ KA(a, b) such that there exists 0 < j < k < n, with
|ωj| (cid:62) R,|ωk| (cid:54) r. Then

P(E) (cid:54) c (r/R) H∂A(a, b).
Proposition 7.16 follows from this lemma since

{ω ∈ KA(a, b) : LE(ω) ∈ E0} ⊂ E.

Since it is possible for ω ∈ E but LE(ω) 6∈ E, we can see why Lemma 7.16
might not be a sharp estimate.
Proof. Let S denote a simple random walk starting at a∗ and let
σ = min{j : |Sj| (cid:62) R},

ρ = min{j : |Sj − a∗| (cid:62) r/2},

τ2r = min{k (cid:62) σ : |Sj| (cid:54) 2r},

τr = min{k (cid:62) σ : |Sj| < r},

T = min{n : Sn 6∈ A}.

Then by the strong Markov property,

Pa∗(E) = X

w∈∂iCr

Pa∗{τr < T, S(τr) = w} HA(w, b).

Note that
Pa∗{τr < T, S(τr) = w}
(cid:54) Pa∗{ρ < T} Pa∗{τ2r < T | ρ < T} Pa∗{S(τr) = w | τ2r < T, ρ < T}.
Using the discrete Beurling estimate (see, e.g., [20, Theorem 6.8.1]), we see
that

Indeed, we get a factor comparable to pr/R as an upper bound for the

Pa∗{τ2r < T | ρ < T} (cid:54) c (r/R).

probability to go from ∂C2r to ∂CR staying in A, and we get another such
factor for the probability of returning from ∂CR to ∂C2r without exiting A.
The rest of the proof proceeds in the same way.) Using a standard estimate

(7.29)

81

for the Poisson kernel in Z2 (cid:114) Cr (see, e.g., [20, Lemma 6.3.7]), we see that
for each w ∈ ∂iCr,

Pa∗{S(τr) = w | τ2r < T, ρ < T} (cid:54) c r−1.

Combining these estimates, we get

Hence, to prove the lemma it suﬃces to prove that

Pa∗{ρ < T} X
Pa∗{ρ < T} X

Note that if w ∈ ∂iCr then either w ∈ ∂Cr−1 or w has a nearest neighbor in
∂Cr−1. Using this we can see that

Using Lemma 7.9, the strong Markov property, and the Harnack inequal-

ity, we have

H∂A(a, b) (cid:62) c Pa∗{ρ < T} HA(0, b).

But using the estimate for the Poisson kernel [20, Lemma 6.3.7] again we
see that

HA(0, b) = X

HCr−1(0, w) HA(w, b) (cid:16) r−1 X

HA(w, b).

w∈∂Cr−1

Combining these estimates completes the proof.

7.8 Proof of Lemma 4.2
Lemma 7.18. There exists c > 0 such that the following holds. Let σh be
the ﬁrst index j such that Im [F(ηj)] (cid:62) 2h. Then for n−1/4 (cid:54) h (cid:54) c,

PA,a,b{−h (cid:54) Re [ηj] (cid:54) h for all j (cid:54) σh} (cid:62) c.

We note that hcap (η[0, σh]) (cid:62) h.

Proof. We ﬁrst consider the following event for the excursion. Let ρ be the
ﬁrst j with Im [ωj] (cid:62) 4h and consider the event that
−h (cid:54) Re [ωj] (cid:54) h, 0 (cid:54) j (cid:54) ρ,

82

Im [ωj] (cid:62) 3h,

ρ (cid:54) j < ∞.

Note that on this event, if η = LE(ω), then

−h (cid:54) Re [ηj] (cid:54) h, 0 (cid:54) j (cid:54) σh.

Hence, we need to show that this event on excursions has positive probability.
The hard work was done in [14, Proposition 3.14] where it is shown that there
exists c0 such that with positive probability, if ρ is the ﬁrst time j that the
excursion reaches {Im (z) (cid:62) c0h}, then P{| Re (Im (ωj)| (cid:54) h/2, 0 (cid:54) j (cid:54) ρ} (cid:62)
c0. (That paper considers the map to the unit disk rather than the upper
half plane, but the result can easily be adapted by mapping the disk to the
half plane.) Given this event, the remainder of the path can be extended
using the invariance principle.

Here we are using a fact about the Poisson kernel. Let us consider

V = V (A, h) = {ζ ∈ A : F(ζ) ∈ {|z| (cid:54) 5h}.
V− = V−(A, h) = {ζ ∈ V : Im [F(ζ)] (cid:54) h},
V+ = V+(A, h) = {ζ ∈ V : Im [F(ζ)] (cid:62) 2h}.

Then by combining (1) and (41) of [14], we can see that for n suﬃciently
large and n−1/4 (cid:54) h (cid:54) n−ε, we have for all ζ+ ∈ V+, ζ− ∈ V−,

H(ζ+, b) (cid:62) 3

2 H(ζ−, b).

(7.30)

(Indeed, we would expect by comparison with the Brownian Green’s function
that there exists k = k(A, a, b, F) such that H(ζ, b) ∼ k Im [F(ζ)] for ζ ∈ V .
We would expect a factor of 2 (with a small error term) and we use 3/2 to
compensate for the samll error.) This estimate implies that the probability
that an excursion starting at ζ ∈ V

We now complete the proof of Lemma 4.2. Let ξ1 be the ﬁrst j such that
|F(ηj)| (cid:62) 4h. Using Beurling, we see that that |F(ηj)| (cid:54) 4h + O(n−1/2) (cid:54)
5h. Let F1 = g1◦F where g1 : F(DAξ1) → H with g(a1) = 0 and g1(z) ∼ z as
z → ∞. Inductively, we deﬁne ξk to be the ﬁrst j such that |Fk−1(ηj)| (cid:62) 4h,
and deﬁne Fk in the same way. Let J be the ﬁrst k such that

Im [Fk−1(ηk)] (cid:62) 2h.

Using the previous lemma, we see that

P{J (cid:62) k} (cid:54) e−αJ ,

83

for some α. In particular, for N suﬃciently large,

P{J (cid:62) h−1/15} (cid:54) exp{−αbh−1/15c} (cid:54) exp{h−1/20}.

Note that hcap[F(ηξJ )] (cid:62) hcap [FJ−1(ηJ)] (cid:62) h. We also claim that there

exists a universal c1 < ∞ such that

diam [F(η[0, ξJ])] (cid:54) c1Jh.

This is a fact about the Loewner equation. More generally, suppose that
K1 ⊂ K2 ⊂ ···
is an increasing sequence of connected hulls in H with
: H (cid:114) Kj → H. Suppose also that for each j,
corresponding maps gj
gj−1(Kj (cid:114) Kj−1) is connected. For any connected hull K (see [17, (3.14)]),

diam(K) (cid:16) capH(K) := lim

y→∞ y Piy{BT ∈ K},

where B is a complex Brownian motion and

T = TK = inf{t : Bt ∈ K ∪ R}.

Using conformal invariance, we see that

capH(K1 ∪ ··· ∪ Kk) (cid:54) kX

diam(K1 ∪ ··· ∪ Kk) (cid:54) c1

8 Estimates about the metric
Here we collect some facts about continuity of the SLE and LERW mea-
sures with respect to the Prokhorov metric. We will not try to give optimal
bounds. We ﬁx a (bounded) analytic, simply connected domain D con-
taining the origin with distinct boundary points a0, b0. We allow constants
to depend on D, a0, b0. Let f : D → D be the unique conformal trans-
formation with f(0) = 0, f0(0) > 0. Since D is analytic, f extends to a
conformal transformation of (1 + ε)D for some ε > 0. In particular, there
exists K = KD < ∞ such that

1
K

(cid:54) |f0(z)| (cid:54) K,

|z| (cid:54) 1.

84

Let ˇD = ˇDN be the lattice approximation of D as before, and let ˇf = ˇfN
be the corresponding map from D to ˇD. Since ˇD has a Jordan boundary, ˇf
extends to a homeomorphism of D. Let ψ = f ◦ ˇf−1 which is a conformal
transformation of ˇD onto D with ψ(0) = 0, ψ0(0) > 0. Note that ψ extends
to a homeomorphism of the closures.
Lemma 8.1. There exists c < ∞, such that for all z ∈ ˇD,

|ψ(z) − z| (cid:54) c

log N

N

.

Moreover, if dist(z, ∂D) (cid:62) c/N,

|ψ0(z) − 1| (cid:54)

c

N dist(z, ∂D) .

Proof. Let U = f−1( ˇD) and g : f−1 ◦ ψ ◦ f = ˇf−1 ◦ f which is the unique
conformal transformation of U onto D with g(0) = 0, g0(0) > 0. By consider-
ing z = f(w) and using the fact that |f0| and 1/|f0| are uniformly bounded,
we see that

|f−1(ψ(z)) − f−1(z)| = K max
w∈U

|g(w) − w|.

|ψ(z) − z| (cid:54) K max

z∈ ˇD

Since dist(∂D, ∂ ˇD) (cid:54) √

2/N, we see that U contains rD where r =
2/N. Let q(z) = g(z)/z, L(z) = Re [log q(z)] = log |g(z)| − log |z|.

1 − K
Using the Schwartz lemma, we see that

|z| (cid:54) |f(z)| (cid:54) r−1 |z|,
Hence, if L(z) = log |g(z)| − |z|, we see that

z ∈ U.

Since L is harmonic, we see that

The same estimate holds therefore for |q0|. Since q(0) = 0, we can integrate
to see that for |z| (cid:54) 1 − 2K

From this we see that there exists c > 0 such that for z ∈ D with ∆z :=

|ψ0(z) − 1| (cid:54) c ∆z (1 + log ∆z)

Lemma 8.2. There exists c < ∞ such that if |a − a0| (cid:54) δ (cid:54) |a − b|/3
and |b − b0| (cid:54) δ (cid:54) |a − b|/3, then there exists a conformal transformation
F : D → D with

|F(z) − z| + |ψ0(z) − 1| (cid:54) c δ,

(8.1)

for all z.
Proof. If D = D, the Möbius transformations can be given explicitly and
checked. For other analytic D we write F = f ◦ T ◦ f−1 where T is an
appropriate Möbius transformation. We omit the details.

This map is not unique, but we ﬁx one such f and allow constants to de-
pend on f. Since D has an analytic boundary, f extends to a transformation
of (1 + ε)D. In particular,

c1 := max

z∈D |f0(z)| < ∞.

Using f and the exact form of Möbius transformations on D we can prove
the following (proof omitted). We will let ρ denote the metric on curves as
well as the corresponding Prokhorov metric on probability measures.
Corollary 8.3. There exists c < ∞ such that for ε suﬃciently small, if
a, b ∈ ∂D with |a − a0|,|b − b0| < ε,

℘(cid:0)µD(a0, b0), µD(a, b)(cid:1) (cid:54) c

ε.

86

Proof. We use the F from the previous lemma and write P, E for probabil-
ities and expectations with respect to µD(a0, b0). If γ is a curve, then (8.1)
implies that

ρ(γ, F ◦ γ) (cid:54) c[tγ + 1] ε,

where tγ is the total content of γ. Since E[t2
shev inequality that

P{tγ (cid:62) ε−1/2} (cid:54) O(ε),

γ] < ∞, we know by the Cheby-

and hence for some c,

P{ρ(γ, F ◦ γ) (cid:62) c

√

ε} (cid:54) ε.

The metric ρ is continuous under truncation in the following sense.
Suppose γ(t) : 0 (cid:54) t (cid:54) tγ is a curve and 0 < r < tγ − s (cid:54) tγ. Let
˜γ(t), 0 (cid:54) t (cid:54) s − r be deﬁned by ˜γ(t) = γ(t + r). Then,

ρ(γ, ˜γ) (cid:54) r ∨ s + max {diam (γ[0, r]) , diam (γ[tγ − s, tγ])} .

Lemma 8.4. There exists c < ∞ such that the following holds. Suppose D
is a domain with distinct boundary points a, b. Suppose ε > 0 and f : D →
f(D) is a conformal transformation that extends to a homeomorphism of D
satisfying |f(z) − z| (cid:54) ε for all z ∈ D. Suppose there exists V ⊂ D such
that

GD(D (cid:114) V ; a, b) + Gf(D) (f(D (cid:114) V ); f(a), f(b)) (cid:54) ε,

Proof. We use natural parametrization throughout this proof. In the case
this is the same as parametrizing by 5/4-dimensional Minkowski content.
We write P for probabilities under the measure µD(a, b).
If γ is a curve from a to b in D, we write f ◦ γ for the corresponding

curve in f(D), parameterized by natural time; more speciﬁcally we have

(f ◦ γ)(ϕ(t)) = f(γ(t)),

87

where

Z t

0

ϕ(t) =

|f0(γ(s))|5/4 ds.

We write γf for the image curve without the change of parametrization,

γf(t) = f(γ(t)).

For any curve γ we write Tγ for the total (Minkowski) length of the curve,
that is, the total time duration in the natural parametrization. In particular,

Z Tγ

|f0(γ(s))|5/4 ds.

Let

and hence

To give an upper bound on the Prokhorov distance between µD(a, b) and
µf(D)(f(a), f(b)) we use the coupling γ ↔ f ◦ γ. Then, we have for all δ > 0,

This estimate is not optimal but suﬃces for our purposes.

Proof. Let ψ be the conformal transformation from Lemma 8.1. f : ˇD → D
be the unique conformal transformation with f(0) = 0, f0(0) > 0. Using the
fact that D has an analytic boundary, we can see that there exists c < ∞

We then use Corollary 8.3.

We will also consider truncated measures. This must be done separately
for SLE and LERW but the argument is essentially the same. We will do
the SLE case considering the measure µ ˇD(ˇa,ˇb). Suppose for each γ, there is
a time t1 (cid:54) Tγ such that |γ(t)− b| (cid:54) r for t (cid:62) t1. If γ1 denotes the truncated
curve, γ1(s) = γ(s), 0 (cid:54) s (cid:54) t1, then

In particular if we take a random time τ for the Brownian motion and let
µτ denote the measure induced by µ ˇD(ˇa,ˇb) by truncating at τ, we have

ρ(γ, γ1) (cid:54) r + (Tγ − t1).

provided that ε, δ are chosen so that

P{diam (γ[τ, Tγ]) (cid:62) ε} (cid:54) δ,

P{Tγ − t (cid:62) ε} (cid:54) δ.

Here P denotes probabilities with respect to the measure µ ˇD(ˇa,ˇb). The ﬁrst
estimate is an SLE estimate about continuity at the endpoint and the second
can be obtained from Markov’s inequality after estimating the expected
Minkowski content in the set {|z| (cid:54) r}.
For LERW the estimate for the number of points visited in {|z| (cid:54) r} is

the same. We use the following estimate.

• Let τ denote the ﬁrst n such that |ηn−N b| (cid:54) rN. Then the probability
that there exists a later point of the LERW distance RN away from
N b is bounded above by c(r/R)2.

This estimate is not optimal; indeed, this estimate is true for the random
walk excursion which implies it is valid for the LERW. We omit the details,
but sketch the idea of the proof. The probability that a random walk starting
distance rN of bN gets distance RN away is O(r/R) by a gambler’s ruin
estimate. Also the Poisson kernel farther away is r/R times the Poisson
kernel closer and hence the probability that the excursion (h-process) goes
out that foar is O((r/R)2),
