1. Introduction

In [FOOO6], Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono construct a one-dimensional family of non-displaceable
Lagrangian tori in (CP 1)2. They arise as ﬁbres of a (informally called) semi-toric moment
map [Wu, Section 3], where the ﬁbres over the interior of the semi-toric moment polytope
are Lagrangian tori, but over a special vertex of the polytope lies a Lagrangian S2 (the
anti-diagonal) where the semi-toric moment map is not diﬀerentiable.

The weighted barycentre of the semi-toric polytope was proven by Oakley-Usher [OU] to
be the Chekanov torus [CS] in (CP 1)2. The other regular ﬁbres are Hamiltonian isotopic
to so called Chekanov type tori described in [Aur1, Example 3.3.1]. In fact, the semi-toric
Lagrangian ﬁbration described in [FOOO6] can be seen as a limit of almost toric ﬁbrations, in
which ‘most of the ﬁbres’ are Chekanov type tori, see [Via3, Section 6.4] and [TV, Remark 3.1].
The deﬁnition of Chekanov type tori can be easily extended to higher dimensions, see
Deﬁnition 4.1. In particular, we can get analogues of the non-displaceable tori [FOOO6]. We
can show that these tori are non-displaceable in (CP 1)2m.

1.1. Results.

Theorem 1.1. For a positive even integer n = 2m, there is a continuum of non-displaceable
Lagrangian tori Θ2m
1/2 = Θ2m is the monotone twist
Lagrangian torus described in [CS]. More precisely, for any Hamiltonian Ψ ∈ Ham((CP 1)2m),
we have that |Θ2m

s ⊂ (CP 1)2m, s ∈ [1/2, 1), for which Θ2m

s ∩ Ψ(Θ2m

s )| ≥ 22m.

The case n = 2 was proven in [FOOO6]. The case n = 1 is clearly false, since only the

monotone circle is non-displaceable.
Question 1.2. For n ≥ 3 odd and s ∈ [1/2, 1), are the tori Θn
displaceable?

s from Deﬁnition 4.2 (non)-

An immediate consequence of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is

Corollary 1.3. For si ∈ [1/2, 1), and positive even integers ki, i = 1, . . . , l, and n ≥(cid:80)

the Lagrangian tori

The idea of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is that we are able to ﬁnd bulk deformations bs for
which the bulk deformed Floer Homology of Θ2m
(decorated with some weakly bounding
cochain σ) is non-zero. The invariance property of the bulk deformed Floer Cohomology under
the action of Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphisms [FOOO4, Theorem 2.5], allow us to conclude that
the above Lagrangian tori are non-displaceable.

Based on the work of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono [FOOO5], regarding spectral invariants with
bulk deformations, quasimorphisms and Lagrangian Floer theory, we are able to strengthen
our result and ﬁnd families of homogeneous Calabi quasimorphisms µbs

We ﬁnish our results by pointing out that the family given in [FOOO6] remain non-
displaceable after we perform two blowups (of the same size) on the rank zero corners of the
singular ﬁbration described in [FOOO6], see Figure 1. This follows from applying the same
ideas as Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono did for the CP 1 × CP 1 case.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows:
In Section 2, we make a quick introduction of bulk deformed potential and Floer cohomology
for a Lagrangian L satisfying Assumption 2.1. We refer the reader to [FOOO4, FOOO5,
FOOO6] for a complete account. We then prove Lemma 2.6 and Corollary 2.9, to show that,
for a Lagrangian torus T , critical points of the potential gives rise to (bulk deformed) Floer
cohomology isomorphic to the usual cohomology of T . We believe that 2.6 is known by experts
on the ﬁeld, but we are not aware of it being written.

In Section 3, we deﬁne the notion of a pair (X, L) consisting of a K¨ahler manifold X
and a Lagrangian submanifold L being K-pseudohomogeneous, for some Lie group K acting
holomorphically and Hamiltonianly on X, leaving L invariant. We showed that if (X, L) is
K-pseudohomogeneous, any Maslov index 2 holomorphic disk with boundary on L such that
its boundary is transverse to K-orbits, is regular. We use that to show regularity for the
Maslov index 2 disks with boundary in Θn
s .

In Section 4, we deﬁne the Lagrangian tori Θn

s , establish its potential function, essentially
computed in [Aur1, Aur2], and prove it satisﬁes Assumption 2.1, for some regular almost
complex structure J with the same potential function of the standard complex structure.

In Section 5, we compute the critical points of the potential bulk deformed by some cocycle
in C2((CP 1)n, Λ+). We show that for n = 2m, there are bulk deformation bs and a weak
bounding cochain bs which is a critical point of the potential POΘ2m
. It then follows from
s
bs
Corollary 2.9 that the bulk deformed Floer cohomology HF (Θ2m
, (bs, bs); Λ) is isomorphic
to the cohomology of the torus. Non-displaceability then follows from [FOOO3, Theorem G]
which is also stated as [FOOO4, Theorem 2.5].

s

In Section 6, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.4.
Finally in Section 7, we describe (CP 2#3CP 2, ω) = (CP 1×CP 1#2CP 2, ω) as two blowups
of capacity  on two corners of the moment polytope of CP 1 × CP 1. The Lagrangian tori L
s
on the blowup comes from Θ2
s and show the
existence of critical points for some bulk deformation. This allow us to prove Theorems 1.6
and 1.8. These tori are equivalent to the ﬁbres of the singular ﬁbration given by blowing up
the corners of the “semi-toric polytope” described in [FOOO6], see Figure 1.

s ∈ CP 1 × CP 1. We compute the potential for L

2. Floer homology and the potential function

Let X be a symplectic manifold and J a regular and compatible almost complex structure.
Let L be a Lagrangian submanifold of X (with a chosen spin structure). We consider a
unital canonical A∞ algebra structure {mk} on the classical cohomology H(L; Λ0,nov) [FOOO6,
Section 6], [FOOO3, Corollary 5.4.6, Theorem A]. The potential function is deﬁned from the
space of weak bounding cochains ˆM(L) of L to Λ0. We refer the reader to [FOOO4, FOOO5,
FOOO6, FOOO3] for the deﬁnition.

Suppose we are given an compatible almost complex structure J0 for which (X, L, J0) satisfy:

Assumption 2.1. Let β ∈ π2(X, L). Assume that:

(A1) If β is represented by a non-constant J0-holomorphic disk, then µL(β) ≥ 2,
(A2) Maslov index 2 J0-holomorphic disks are regular.

where µL is the Maslov index.

By the work of Gromov [Gro], we have:

Proposition 2.2. If (X, L, J0) satisfy Assumption 2.1, then there exists a regular almost com-
plex structure J (close to J0), so that (X, L, J) satisfy Assumption (A1), and [ev0∗M1(β, J)] =
[ev0∗M1(β, J0)], for all β such that µL(β) = 2.

The almost complex structure from Proposition 2.2 implies [FOOO6, Condition 6.1], hence
by [FOOO6, Theorem A.1, Theorem A.2] there is an embedding of H 1(L, Λ0) into ˆM(L) and
restricted to H 1(L, Λ0) the potential function POL is so that

in the class β with 1 marked point and ev0 : M1(β) → L is the evaluation map.

Here [M1(β)] is the (virtual) fundamental class of the moduli space of J-holomorphic disks
Using a notation closer to [Aur1, Aur2] we deﬁne for β ∈ π2(X, L):

β ω exp(b ∩ ∂β).
Letting ηβ be the degree of ev0 : M1(β) → L, we can write:

zβ(L, b) = T

(2.4)

We want to consider the Floer cohomology of L bulk-deformed by a class b = T ρ[s] ∈
H 2(X, Λ+) [FOOO4]. The potential function will depend on the cocycle b ∈ C2(X, L; Z), even
though the Floer cohomology doesn’t. Since we use a cocycle in degree 2 (Poincar´e dual to a

6

cycle of codimension 2) the degree of the bulked deformed A∞ maps mb
unaﬀected by the bulk and the bulk deformed potential is given by:

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

Remark 2.4. Using Assumption 2.1 and Proposition 2.2, one should be able to deﬁne the
Floer cohomology using the Pearl version [BC], and analogously deﬁne its bulk-deformed
version, which should be isomorphic to the one in Deﬁnition 2.3. In that framework, the proof
of Leibniz rule (2.9) follows the same ideas as [Buh, Theorem 4].

By the work of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono, we have:

Theorem 2.5 ( Theorem G [FOOO3], Theorem 2.5 [FOOO4]). If ψ : X → X is a Hamiltonian
diﬀeomorphism, then ψ(L) ∩ L is not smaller than the dimension of HF (L, (b, b); Λ0,nov).

We would like to point out that the product mb,b
2

product in the sense that for x, y ∈ H(L, Λ0) of pure degrees |x| and |y|,

can be thought as deformation of the cup

2 (x, y) = x ∪ y + other terms
mb,b

(2.11)
where x ∪ y comes from counting constant disks and the other terms is a sum of elements
of degree smaller than |x| + |y| in H(L, Λ0,nov), since it comes from evaluating moduli spaces
Mk,l+1(β) to a cycle of dimension |x| + |y| − µL(β) and (X, L, J) satisﬁes Assumption (A1).
The following Lemma is well established for the monotone case in [Buh], and in the general

case in [FOOO6].

Lemma 2.6 (Theorem 2.3 of [FOOO6]). Take (X, L) satisfying Assumption 2.1. Also assume
that H(L, Λ0) is generated by H 1(L, Λ0) as an algebra with respect to the classical cup product.
If mb,b

1 |H 1(L,Λ0,nov) = 0 then mb,b

1 ≡ 0.

1 |H 0(L,Λ0,nov) = 0. Since H(L, Λ0) is generated by H 1(L, Λ0)
Proof. First we point out that mb,b
with respect to the cup product, we only need to show by induction on the degree that for
x and y of pure degree |x| ≥ 1, |y| ≥ 1, mb,b
1 (z) = 0 for all z, such that
|z| < |x| + |y|. Using (2.11),

1 (x ∪ y) = 0, if mb,b

1 (x ∪ y) = mb,b
mb,b

1 (mb,b

2 (x, y)) − mb,b

1 (other terms) = 0

by induction hypothesis and using the Leibniz rule (2.9).

(cid:3)

Remark 2.7. Lemma 2.6 strengthen the result of [FOOO3, Theorem 6.4.35] and [Buh],
showing that the minimal Maslov number ML of any Lagrangian torus L (or any orientable
Lagrangian such that the cohomology ring is generated by H 1) in Cn is 2, provided T
satisﬁes Assumption 2.1 for some J. That is because the Lagrangian is orientable and
HF (T, (b, b); Λ) ≡ 0 (from Theorem 2.5, since T is displaceable), so there must be a Maslov
index 2 disk. The inequality 2 ≤ ML ≤ n + 1 was proven in [FOOO3, Theorem 6.1.17], for
any spin Lagrangian L ⊂ Cn satisfying Assumption 2.1, via the use of spectral sequence.
Deﬁnition 2.8. Take (X, L) satisfying the assumptions of Lemma 2.6. Assume that π1(L) ∼=
H1(L, Z) and π2(X, L) ∼= π2(X) ⊕ H1(L, Z). So, we are able to write the Potential function
(2.5) in terms of zi = zβi, for some β1, . . . , βn ∈ π2(X, L), where ∂β1, . . . , ∂βn is a basis of
H1(L, Z). We say that b is a critical point of POL

b (b) if:

zi

b (b)

∂POL
∂zi

= 0.

Corollary 2.9 (Theorem 2.3 of [FOOO6]). Take (X, L) satisfying the assumptions of Lemma
b (b) (2.5) for b = T ρ[s] ∈ H 2(X, Λ+),
2.6 and Deﬁnition 2.8. If b is a critical point of POL
then HF (L, (b, b); Λ) ∼= H(L; Λ).
Proof. Take a basis x1, . . . , xn a basis of H1(L, Z). Let β1, . . . , βn ∈ π2(X, L) ∼= π2(X) ⊕
H1(L, Z), be so that ∂βi = xi ∈ H1(L, Z) and write the Potential POL
b (b) (2.5) in terms of
zi = zβi.
1 (σ) for σ ∈ H 1(L, Λ), only counts contributions of
Maslov index 2 disks. A Maslov index 2 J-holomorphic disk in the class β = γ+k1β1+···+knβn,
γ ∈ π2(X) contributes to mb,b

Since s is of degree 2, we have that mb,b

1 (σ) as

3. Regularity Lemma

We now move to the K¨ahler setting and we discuss a Lemma that we will use to prove
s with respect to the standard complex

regularity for Maslov index 2 disks with boundary on Θn
structure in (CP 1)n. The following deﬁnition is inspired in [EL, Deﬁnition 1.1.1].

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let L be a n dimensional Lagrangian in a K¨ahler manifold X. Assume
that K is a Lie group of dimension n − 1 acting Hamiltonianly and holomorphically on X
preserving L. Assume that the action restricted to L is free. Then we say that (X, L) is
K-pseudohomogeneous.

We get then the following Lemma:

Lemma 3.2. Let (X, L) be K-pseudohomogeneous, for some Lie group K. If u is a Maslov
index 2 holomorphic disk such that ∂u is transverse to the K-orbits, then u is regular.

The proof of the above Lemma relies on the Lemmas below, very similar to [Via2, Lem-

mas 5.19, 5.20].
Lemma 3.3. Let u : D → X be a Maslov index 2 disk in a K¨ahler manifold X of complex
dimension n with boundary on a Lagrangian L. Assume that u|∂D is an immersion. Call
W = du(r∂/∂θ) a holomorphic vector ﬁeld along u vanishing at 0 and tangent to the boundary.
Assume also that there exists V1, . . . , Vn−1 holomorphic vector ﬁelds in u∗T X such that W ∧
V1∧···∧ Vn−1 (cid:54)= 0 along the boundary of u. Then u is an immersion and no linear combination
of the Vi’s is tangent to u(D).
Proof. Up to reparametrization, we may assume du(0) (cid:54)= 0. The result follows from the fact
that the zeros of det2(W ∧ V1 ∧ ··· ∧ Vn−1) computes the Maslov index, which is assumed to
be 2. So W ∧ V1 ∧ ··· ∧ Vn−1 can only vanish once (with order 1). Since W already vanishes
at 0, we cannot have either du(x) = 0 or a linear combination of the Vi’s being a complex
(cid:3)
multiple of W .
Lemma 3.4. Let uθ1,...,θn−1 be an n − 1 dimensional family of Maslov index 2 holomorphic
disks in a K¨ahler manifold X of complex dimension n, θi ∈ (−, ). If u := u0,...,0 and Vi := ∂u
satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 3.3, then u is regular.

∂θi

Proof. It follows similar arguments as in [Via2, Lemma 5.19]. Using Lemma 3.3, we are able
to split u∗T X = T D ⊕ L1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Ln, as holomorphic vector bundles where Li is the trivial
|∂DT L = T ∂D⊕ Re(L1)⊕···⊕ Re(Ln). As in [Via2, proof
line bundle generated by Vi. Also, u∗
of Lemma 5.19], we see that the kernel of the linearised ¯∂ operator is isomorphic to

n−1(cid:77)

TIdAut(D)

hol((D, ∂D), (C, R))

Hence the kernel has dimension n + 2 = n + µΘn

s (u) = index.

i=1

(cid:3)

We proceed to:

Proof of Lemma 3.2. Since the K action is holomorphic and ∂u is transverse to the K-orbits,
we can build uθ1,...,θn from a neighbourhood of Id ∈ K, satisfying all the hypothesis of Lemma
3.4.

4. The Lagrangian tori Θn
s

In this section we give an explicit description of the tori Θn

s and of its potential function,
which encodes the number of Maslov index 2 discs that Θn
s bounds. For a deﬁnition of the
potential, we refer the reader to [FOOO2, Section 4],[FOOO3]. See also the deﬁnition of
superpotential in [Aur2, Section 2.2].

Idea of proof. First we consider positivity of intersection of an holomorphic disc with the

that Maslov index 2 classes admitting holomorphic representatives must be of the form β,
Hi − β − αi + αj, where i, j = 1, . . . , n and αn = 0. Computations of the holomorphic discs
and their algebraic count can be done explictly. We omit here since it follows a straightforward
procedure as in [Aur1, Proposition 5.12], see ﬁnal remark after Proposition 3.3 in [Aur2]. See
also [Via2, Section 5] for similar computations.
We can choose a spin structure so that every disk counts positively, i.e., ev0 : M1 → Θn

is orientation preserving, e.g. by choosing a trivialisation of T Θn
s using the boundary of
{α1,··· , αn−1, β}, as spin structure. See [Via2, Section 5.5] and [Cho, Section 8], for a
complete discussion in a similar scenario.

5. Proof of Theorem 1.1 - Bulk deformations

In this section we use bulk deformations to prove that the tori Θn

s are non-displaceable for
n even and s ∈ [1/2, 1), as done in [FOOO6] for the case n = 2. In [FOOO6], Fukaya-Oh-
Ohta-Ono used the cocycle Poincar´e dual to the anti-diagonal in CP 1 × CP 1 to bulk-deform
Floer-homology. In this section we will bulk-deform Floer-homology by an element of the form
T ρ[h] ∈ H∗((CP 1)n, Λ+), where [h] ∈ H 2((CP 1)n, Z).

For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let hi be the cocycle Poincar´e dual to {yi = 0} ⊂ (CP 1)n.

Proposition 5.1. The potential for the Lagrangian tori Θn
b = T ρ[(k1 + kn)h1 + ··· + (kn−1 + kn)hn−1 + knhn] ∈ C2((CP 1)n, Λ+) is given by

Proof. The relative classes β, αj have no intersection with {yk = 0} viewed as a cycle in

k = i, and with multiplicity 1. Hence, the coeﬃcient of the monomial T wj/uwi is bulk-deformed

We call the valuation of an element in Λ+ the smallest exponent with non-zero coeﬃcient.

Looking at the expression of the critical points of the previous Lemma, one can see that:

Lemma 5.3. Looking at the critical points given on Lemma 5.2 we have that, the valuation
of u is not 1/2 if and only if n = 2m and m − 1 i’s are equal to 1 while the other m i’s
are equal to −1, where i = 1, . . . , 2m − 1. In that case, the valuation of u is T 1/2+ρ, provided

iki (cid:54)= 0.

Now we recall that

u = zβ = T s exp(b ∩ ∂β)

for the class β deﬁned in the beginning of Section 4.2. By Lemma 5.3, we have:

Corollary 5.4. Take s > 1/2 and consider the cocycle bs = T s−1/2[(k1 + k2m)h1 + ··· +
(k2m−1 + k2m)h2m−1 + k2mh2m] ∈ C2((CP 1)2m, Λ+). Assume that not all ki’s are 0, for
i = 1, . . . , 2m − 1, i.e., [bs] is not a multiple of the monotone symplectic form. Then there
exists bs a critical point of POΘ2m

Theorem 5.5. For s ≥ 1/2 there exists a bulk [bs] ∈ H 2((CP 1)2m, Λ+) and a weak bounding

6. Quasi-morphisms and quasi-states

In this section we prove the last part of Theorem 1.4. It follows arguments similar to

[FOOO5, Theorem 23.4].
Lemma 6.1. For any b = T ρ[l1h1 + ··· + ln−1hn−1 + lnhn] ∈ C2((CP 1)n, Λ+), the bulk
deformed Quantum cohomology [FOOO5, Section 5] is semi-simple.

Proof. By [FOOO1, Theorem 1.1.1] (see also [FOOO2, Theorem 6.1], for the Fano case) we
have an isomorphism between the bulk deformed Quantum cohomology of a toric symplectic
manifold and the Jacobian Ring of the bulk deformed toric potential. If the bulk deformed
toric potential has only non-degenerate critical points, we can split the Quantum cohomology
ring into orthogonal algebra summands according to the factors corresponding to the critical
points under the isomorphism given in [FOOO1, Theorem 1.1.1].
{xi = 0}, we have that the bulk deformed potential of a toric ﬁber is:

7. Tori in CP 2#3CP 2

In this section we prove Theorem 1.8. We will describe a model for (CP 2#3CP 2, ω) =
(CP 1 × CP 1#2CP 2, ω) which is equivalent to performing two blowups of capacities  centred
at the rank 0 elliptic singularities (corners) of the singular ﬁbration of CP 1 × CP 1 described
in [FOOO6], see Figure 1.

Figure 1. Singular ﬁbrations of CP 1 × CP 1 and CP 2#3CP 2.

Consider CP 1 × CP 1 with coordinates ([x1 : y1], [x2 : y2]) as in Section 4.1. Consider also
s, the function f = x1x2/y1y2, the relative class β and α := α1 and the divisor

coordinate plane xi = 1, yj = 1, i, j = 1, 2, i (cid:54)= j. Denote Si() = ∂Bi(). Let (CP 2#3CP 2, ω)
be the result of blowing up [MS, Section 7] CP 1×CP 1 with respect to B1() and B2(), so that
the exceptional curves Ei (coming from collapsing the Hopf ﬁbration in Si()) have symplectic
area ω(Ei) = , i = 1, 2. Let j be the induced complex structure and L
s correspond to Θ2
after the blowup. Note that  can take any value in (0, 1), so that B1() ∩ B2() = ∅.
s
Note also that f = x1x2/y1y2 is constant along the ﬁbers of the Hopf ﬁbration of both S1()
and S2(). In particular it give rise to a (j, j)-holomorphic function ˜f : CP 2#3CP 2 → CP 1.
s it is interesting that the disks of Proposition 4.5, remain
essentially the same. This can be obtained by stretching the complex structure j. So take
δ small enough so that B1(δ) ∪ B2(δ) does not intersect any Maslov index 2 holomorphic
disk. Consider a diﬀeomorphism ϕ : (CP 2#3CP 2, ω) → (CP 2#3CP 2, ωδ) coming from a
ﬁnite neck stretch [EGH, BEH+] along Si( + δ(cid:48)) ⊂ (CP 2#3CP 2, ω) [BEH+, EGH], see also
[Via1, Section 3], which sends L
s. The diﬀeomorphism ϕ is equivalent to considering an
inﬂation along the exceptional curves Ei, i = 1, 2. Set Jδ = ϕ∗jδ, an ω compatible almost
complex structure.

For computing the potential for L

Proof. It is enough to compute the jδ-holomorphic disks with boundary in Lδ

s, which gives the terms

Let ˜D be the proper transform of the divisor D ∈ CP 1 × CP 1. It can be checked that, twice
˜D + E1 + E2 is Poincar´e dual to the Maslov class µLδ
. This implies Assumption (A1), as in the
proof of Proposition 4.7. Moreover, Maslov index 2 disks intersects ˜D + E1 + E2 once. Which
means that if a jδ-holomorphic disk u intersects either E1 or E2, by positivity of intersection,
it does not intersect ˜D and hence ˜f ◦ u : D → C∗ must be constant. There are two Maslov
index 2 disks in the ﬁber ˜f−1(c), for c ∈ γs. Looking at the intersections with Ei, and the
proper transform of {xi = 0} and {yi = 0}, we can see that the relative classes of these disks
are H1 − E1 + α and H2 − E2 − α (for some orientation of α). Since, ω(Hi − Ei ± α) = 1 − ,
we get the remaining term

To show regularity of the above disks, one notes that the pre-image under ˜f of a small

Moreover, ( ˜f−1(Ns), Lδ

Remark 7.2. The above potential can also be computed by a technique similar to the one
