Abstract

The distance on a set is a comparative function. The smaller the distance between two elements of that

set, the closer, or more similar, those elements are. Fr´echet axiomatized the distance into what is today known

as a metric. In this thesis we study the generalization of Fr´echet’s axioms in various ways including a partial

metric, strong partial metric, partial n − Metric and strong partial n − Metric. Those generalizations allow

for negative distances, non-zero distances between a point and itself and even the comparison of n−tuples.

We then present the scoring of a DNA sequence, a comparative function that is not a metric but can be

modeled as a strong partial metric.

Using the generalized metrics mentioned above we create topological spaces and investigate convergence,

limits and continuity in them. As an application, we discuss contractiveness in the language of our generalized

metrics and present Banach-like ﬁxed, common ﬁxed and coincidence point theorems.

Acknowledgements

The Ph.D. program was by far my most challenging endeavor. Luckily, I did not go through it alone. I

would like to take a moment to thank the silent heroes who helped me make this possible:

Professor emeritus Edward Tymchatyn: Prof. Tymchatyn was my supervisor during my Ph.D.

program. He had an open door policy, always made sure to make time for me and broadened my horizons by

exposing me to topological conferences in which I presented my ﬁndings. No question was too small for him

to answer and, with an extensive knowledge in topology, he was an inexhaustible source of knowledge to be

envied for. His attention to minute details, mathematical rigor and perfectionist approach provided lessons

I hope to keep with me on my journey.

Doctor Koushik Pal: Dr. Pal is my co-author for the ﬁrst two papers submitted. As an under-

graduate student, I was used to being presented with a question and ﬁnding a way to prove it. At the

graduate level however, things are not as straightforward. It is with him that I learnt that as mathematical

investigators, we may actually change the question. This is a simple lesson but a very important one. It is

with Dr. Pal that my journey as a researcher started.

Associate Professor Christopher Dutchyn: Prof. Dutchyn introduced me to the scoring of DNA

strands mentioned in Section 2.2. His valuable insight on DNA scoring scheme guided me as I investigated

the subject. He also took time from his busy schedule to read and discuss my ﬁrst results in partial metrics.

Additionally, he was my go-to reference in latex coding. The organized bibliography and referencing system

are all thanks to him.

Assistant Professor Katarzyna Kuhlmann: Prof. Kuhlmann was the one who introduced me to

the notion of generalized metrics. One day, while she was walking down the hall, I saw a partial metric paper

in her hand and asked her about it. She took the time to introduce it, explain it and point me in the right

direction for further research. She also took time to discuss dislocated metrics and present some examples. It

is thanks to her positive attitude and willingness to help that ignited my interest in the topic which I ended

up researching.

Professor Franz-Viktor Kuhlmann: Prof. Kuhlmann organized the ﬁxed point theorem seminars

in our department. During those seminars, I was exposed to various techniques which sparked the main

questions for my ﬁrst paper. Additionally, he took the time to read the ﬁrst paper and suggested valuable

amendments.

iii

Assistant Professor Walid Abou Salem: There is more to the graduate program than the mathe-

matics part and Prof. Abou Salem was a refreshing reference. A true teacher at heart, he understands the

diﬃculties we experience as students and always provided valuable advice. He was a tremendous support on

this journey.

Mathematics Department Oﬃce Administrators: Simply stated, they are amazing. With an

uplifting smile and the knowledge to navigate policies in the most eﬃcient way, they made every problem,

no matter how big, seem easily manageable. A detailed explanation of procedures, email reminders and

ingenious solutions were always happily provided in such a clear way that I had no problem staying on top

of what was required of me.

Mathematics Department Systems Manager Richard Kondra: From downloading a program

I needed, to updating Bakoma packages, to adjusting screen problems, to setting lecture conferences and the

list goes on and on. Mr. Kondra was our IT savior and thankfully, a very patient one.

iv

This thesis is dedicated to every graduate student who feels overwhelmed. It is normal to doubt your

capabilities when you are dealing with professors who spent their entire career researching that ﬁeld. Be

patient: You do have what it takes, you just need experience. Persevere and enjoy the journey.

“We fail to realize that mastery is not about perfection. It’s a process, a journey. The master stays on

the path day after day, year after year. The master is willing to try and fail and try again, for as long as

he/she lives.”—George Leonard

Introduction

1.1 Why do we generalize a metric?

Given a set X, a metric is a function d : X × X → R as deﬁned in Section 2.1. The point of a metric

is for it to be a comparative function. For any two given elements x and y of X, the value (also called the

distance) d(x, y) represents how close x and y are to each other. Here, we use “close” in a loose sense as its

meaning may vary depending on what information we need when comparing the elements of X. For example,

when we say the distance between Paris and Saskatoon is 6944.32 km, the information we are looking for

is the amount of space that needs to be traveled to go from one to the other in a direct straight ﬂight. In

Computer Science, when we say the error between the actual value of π and 3.14 is of the order of 10−2, the

information we are conveying is how good of an estimation is 3.14 to the real value of π?

Unfortunately some comparative functions, although very meaningful, do not adhere to the strict axioms

of a metric presented in Section 2.1. One example is the scoring presented in Section 2.3. A scoring is a

function used to compare the similarity between two DNA strands. We generalize the known metric in two

steps depicted in the ﬁgure below:

(cid:21)

Partial metric and Strong partial metric.

(Section 2.2 and Section 2.3)

(cid:21)

Partial n − Metric and Strong Partial n − Metric.

(Section 2.5 and Section 2.6)

First we generalize the metric into a partial metric by allowing the self distance (the distance between a point

and itself) to take real values that may be diﬀerent than zero. Then we generalize a partial metric that acts

on pairs into a‘ partial n − Metric that acts on n−tuples. The Partial n − Metric is the most general case

presented. As an application, we use these generalized metrics to form ﬁxed point theorems.

1

1.2 Why do we study ﬁxed point theory?

Fixed point theory is a branch of topology that studies the conditions under which a function from a set

to itself has a ﬁxed point.

Advancements in ﬁxed point theory enrich many scientiﬁc ﬁelds such as biology, chemistry, computer

science, economics and game theory. Below we give one example from each ﬁeld which illustrates the use of

ﬁxed point theory in that science.

In biology, ﬁxed point theory helps with studying how cancer cells replicate. Statistical data is collected,

modeled, and ﬁxed point theorems are used to form an educated guess of how those cells will progress in the

future.

In chemistry, the branch that uses computer programs and simulations is called computational chemistry.

This branch of chemistry investigates the charge density and electronic charge per volume of atoms, ions and

molecules. The bigger the molecule studied, the more complex the problem becomes. Some of the problems

are too complex to be solved analytically, hence, ﬁxed point theory is used to develop an iterative process

that will converge to a solution.

In computer science, ﬁxed point theory is used to check whether a program will stabilize or run indeﬁnitely.

In economics and game theory, ﬁxed point theory is used to prove that a certain simulation has at least

one equilibrium point.

1.3 How are ﬁxed point theorems classiﬁed?

There are two approaches to the study of ﬁxed point theory. The ﬁrst is an existential approach where,

under some criteria, we ensure that a function has a ﬁxed point. Unfortunately, the theory itself does not

provide a way of constructing the ﬁxed point. One example of such an approach is the Brouwer’s Fixed Point

Theorem which ensures the existence of a ﬁxed point for a continuous function over a compact convex set in

a Euclidian space.

The second approach is an iterative one where, under some criteria, we are able to construct a sequence

whose terms converge to a limit which is a ﬁxed point of the function in question. The main example is

the Banach Fixed Point Theorem which asserts that continuous functions on a complete metric space have

a ﬁxed point should those functions be contractive.

1.4 What are we presenting in this thesis?

In this thesis, we restrict ourselves to iterative approaches to ﬁxed point theorems. Our major concern is

that this method relies heavily on a metric to allow us to see if successive iterations are getting “closer” fast

enough or not. In some cases, such as in comparing DNA strands, the use of a metric is too computationally

2

taxing. One would like to use a comparison score which may not satisfy all the axioms of a metric. General-

ized metrics are obtained by amending metric axioms to allow meaningful comparison scores to be used.

We present four improvements to the metrics and ﬁxed point theorems at hand:

1) A metric assigns a number to each pair of points; the smaller the number, the closer the points are

together. G¨ahler[16, 17] presented the following question: Can we do a similar thing to assess a triplet? Will

our new “metric” be stable enough to describe a To topology? Many mathematicians have attempted to

deﬁne such a “metric”; some with more success than others. In this thesis we deﬁne and generalize n-metrics

by assigning a number to each n-tuple and generate a To topology from that generalized metric.

2) Edelstein[10, 11, 12] generalized the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to allow the continuous function of

a metric space to itself to be contractive only on the orbit of a certain point xo ∈ X. We adapt Edelstein’s

idea and use it with the new generalized metrics discussed above. Our functions may not even be continuous

but are contractive on an orbit.

3) Matthews[7, 25] extended Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem to ”metrics” where self distances are not neces-

sarily zero. Those “metrics” are also known as partial metrics. His theorems, however, only applied where

the limit has a self distance ( in this paper called a central distance) of zero. O’Neill[29] extended the def-

initions of partial metrics to allow negative values. We extend Matthews’ theorems to partial metrics in

the sense of O’Neill. We also extend those theorems to allow the ﬁxed point to have a self distance ( the

distance between that ﬁxed point and itself) to be any real number rather than be restricted to the value zero.

4) A. Markov[24] began investigating common ﬁxed point theorems for commuting maps. His Theorem

was later generalized by S. Kakutani[20] to give us the Markov-Kakutani ﬁxed-point theorem. S. Eilenberg

and D. Montgomery[13] were among the ﬁrst to investigate coincidence points for non-self maps, where the

domain set is ordered. We generalize the techniques used in ﬁxed point theorems to common and coincidence

point theorems. Our approach allows us to present common and coincidence point theorems where neither

commuting functions nor ordered spaces are required.

1.5 How do we organize our work?

We organize our work into six chapters:

In Chapter 2, we concentrate on generalizing the original notion of metric and partial metric. We deﬁne

strong partial metrics, partial n − Metrics, and strong partial n − Metrics. We also present other generalized

metrics already found in the literature. We give examples of each and derive some inequalities needed for

3

the chapters to come.

In Chapter 3, we deﬁne open balls for each of the generalized metrics deﬁned in Chapter 2. We show that

these balls form a basis for a topology that is at least To and, in some generalized metric cases, even T1. The

T0 property is important because we want our topologies to be able to distinguish points.

In Chapter 4, we deﬁne Cauchy sequences for each of our generalized metrics. We investigate the prop-

erties of the limits of Cauchy sequences in each case. We then move on to deﬁne a stronger version of the

topological limit called the special limit, study it’s properties and deﬁne a complete space. We also introduce

the notion of Cauchy pairs. Those are pairs of sequences whose terms eventually get arbitrarily “close” to

one another.

In Chapter 5, we present a variety of contractive conditions on functions, or pairs of functions, suﬃcient

for the use of iterative methods to obtain Cauchy sequences.

In Chapter 6, we investigate some criteria of functions, such as a relaxed version of continuity, and study

their eﬀect on the limits of the sequences found in Chapter 5. Those properties will make sure the iterations

lead to a ﬁxed point, common ﬁxed point, or a coincidence point as shown in Chapter 7.

Chapter 7 is dedicated to our main theorems. The proofs will be short and direct due to the extensive

scaﬀolding created in the previous chapters. Our main theorems consist of ﬁxed point, common ﬁxed point

and coincidence point theorems in each of the generalized metric spaces. The ﬁxed point theorems use a

technique similar to Edelstein’s by taking a function that is contracting on an orbit and provide additional

constraints needed for the function to have a ﬁxed point. The common ﬁxed point theorems have a similar

contractive approach. B. Fisher[14], C.C. Yeh[32] and many others developed common ﬁxed point theorems

that rely on the two functions commuting (f (g(x)) = g(f (x))), or a weaker form. We adapt our contractive

approach to generate common ﬁxed point theorems that do not require the two functions to commute. Fi-

nally, we formulate a coincidence point theorem where the only requirement on the domain is for it to be a

complete generalized metric space.

Metrics and their generalizations

Distances have been used in the world since times immemorial. Fr´echet[15] was the ﬁrst to axiomatize a

distance, he called it ´ecart. Hausdorﬀ[19] coined the term metric space and used metrics to deﬁne a topology.

Michel Marie Deza & Elena Deza in their book Encyclopedia of Distances[8] provided us with an unparalleled

reference for a variety of metrics that appear in the literature.

In this chapter we present the various generalized metrics used in this thesis. Some of these generalizations

are already found in the literature. We will state the motivation for each and provide some examples. In

order not to make this chapter too cumbersome, we give proofs only in non-trivial cases.

2.1 Metric

Deﬁnition 2.1.1. A metric d on a set X is a function d : X × X → R satisfying the following axioms:

For all x, y, z ∈ X,

(m-lbnd): 0 ≤ d(x, y).

(non-negative axiom or lower boundary axiom)

(m-sym): d(x, y) = d(y, x).

(m-sep): d(x, y) = 0 ⇐⇒ x = y.

(symmetry axiom)

(separation axiom)

(m-inq): d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y).

(triangular inequality axiom)

We remark that in his paper Fr´echet[15] assumed but did not actually state (m-sym). The reader who

would like more information on metrics and metric topologies may consult [26].

2.2 Partial Metric

In 1992, Matthews[25] considered ﬁnite sequences as partially computed versions of inﬁnite sequences.

He noticed that depending on the computational approach, from the computer’s perspective, two computed

sequences of the same original inﬁnite sequence need not be identical. Therefore, a distance between a

sequence and itself need not be zero. Motivated by this observation, Matthews generalized metrics into what

he called partial metrics where a distance between a point and itself need no longer be zero. This change

led him to modify the initial metric axioms (see Deﬁnition 2.1.1). His partial metrics however, allowed only

non-negative values.

6

In 1996, O’Neill[29] generalized Matthews’ partial metric to allow negative values. When we mention a

partial metric from here on, we will be referring to O’Neill’s partial metric.

Deﬁnition 2.2.1. A partial metric p on a set X is a function p : X × X → R satisfying the following

axioms:

For all x, y, z ∈ X,

(p-lbnd): p(x, x) ≤ p(x, y).

(p-sym): p(x, y) = p(y, x).

(p-sep): p(x, x) = p(x, y) = p(y, y) ⇐⇒ x = y.

(p-inq): p(x, y) ≤ p(x, z) + p(z, y) − p(z, z).

It is easy to see that every metric is a partial metric with self distance ( i.e. distance of a point to itself)

equal to zero. Every partial metric deﬁnes a metric as follows:

Lemma 2.2.1. (O’Neill[29]: Lemma 2.7 ) Let p be a partial metric deﬁned on a set X. Deﬁne d : X ×X → R

as follows:

For all x, y ∈ X,

Then, d is a metric on X.

d(x, y) = 2p(x, y) − p(x, x) − p(y, y).

Proof: This Lemma is a special case of Theorem 2.5.5.

We will show in Chapter 3 that the topological structure on a set induced by a partial metric is coarser

than that induced by the metric described in Lemma 2.2.1.

We give some examples of simple partial metrics.

Example 2.2.2. (Basic Partial Metric):

Consider the set X = {x, y}. Let p : X × X → R be deﬁned by:

p(x, x) = 0, p(x, y) = 1 and p(y, y) = 1.

Then p is a partial metric on X.

Example 2.2.3. (Maximum Partial Metric[25]):

Consider X ⊆ R. Let p : X × X → R be deﬁned by setting for all x, y ∈ X,

p(x, y) = max{x, y}.

Then p is a partial metric on X.

Proof:Let x, y, z ∈ X.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that x ≤ y. Thus,

(⋆) : p(x, x) = x, p(y, y) = y, and p(x, y) = y.

7

Proof of (p-lbnd): From (⋆) we deduce that

p(x, x) = x ≤ y = p(x, y) and p(y, y) = y = p(x, y).

Proof of (p-sym): From (⋆) we have p(x, y) = y and p(y, x) = y , so, p(x, y) = p(y, x).

Proof of (p-sep):

(⇐) Trivial.

(⇒): Suppose

Then from (⋆) it is trivial to see that x = y.

p(x, x) = p(x, y) = p(y, y).

Proof of (p-inq): Knowing that x ≤ y, to prove (p-inq) we need to consider three cases correspond-

ing to the three possible orderings of {x, y, z}:

Case 1: Suppose that z ≤ x ≤ y. Then p(x, z) + p(y, z) − p(z, z) = x + y − z = y + (x − z) ≥ y = p(x, y).

Case 2: Suppose that x ≤ z ≤ y. Then p(x, z) + p(y, z) − p(z, z) = z + y − z = y = p(x, y).

Case 3: Suppose that x ≤ y ≤ z. Then p(x, z) + p(y, z) − p(z, z) = z + z − z = z ≥ y = p(x, y).

Therefore, in all cases,

p(x, y) ≤ p(x, z) + p(z, y) − p(z, z).

(cid:3)

Example 2.2.4. (Augmented Real Line):

Consider the set X = R ∪ {a} where a /∈ R. Let p : X × X → R be deﬁned by:

For all x, y ∈ R,

p(a, a) = 0, p(a, x) = |x| and p(x, y) = |x − y| − 1.

Then p is a partial metric on X.

Proof: Let x, y, z ∈ R.

Proof of (p-lbnd): Three cases arise.

Case 1: p(a, a) = 0 and p(a, x) = |x|, hence, p(a, a) ≤ p(a, x).

Case 2: p(x, x) = −1 and p(a, x) = |x|, hence, p(x, x) ≤ p(a, x).

Case 3: p(x, x) = −1 and p(x, y) = |x − y| − 1, hence, p(x, x) ≤ p(x, y).

Proof of (p-sym): Trivial.

Proof of (p-sep):

(⇐) Trivial.

8

(⇒): Let x, y ∈ R.

Suppose that

p(x, x) = p(x, y) = p(y, y).

Then, −1 = |x − y| − 1 giving us that x = y.

Now suppose that

Then, p(a, a) = p(x, x) which is a contradiction since 0 6= −1.

p(a, a) = p(a, x) = p(x, x).

Proof of (p-inq): The proof of (p-inq) is given by considering four possible claims. Let x, y, z ∈ X.

Claim 1: p(a, a) ≤ p(a, x) + p(a, x) − p(x, x).

Proof of claim 1:

p(a, x) + p(a, x) − p(x, x) = |x| + |x| − (−1) = 2|x| + 1 ≥ 0 = p(a, a).

Claim 2: p(x, x) ≤ p(a, x) + p(a, x) − p(a, a).

Proof of claim 2:

p(a, x) + p(a, x) − p(a, a) = 2|x| ≥ −1 = p(x, x).

Claim 3: p(x, y) ≤ p(a, x) + p(a, y) − p(a, a).

Proof of claim 3:

p(a, x) + p(a, y) − p(a, a) = |x| + |y| ≥ |x − y| ≥ |x − y| − 1 = p(x, y).

Claim 4: p(x, y) ≤ p(x, z) + p(z, y) − p(z, z).

Proof of claim 4: We have

p(x, z) + p(z, y) − p(z, z) = |x − z| − 1 + |y − z| − 1 − (−1)

= |x − z| + |y − z| − 1 ≥ |(x − z) − (y − z)| − 1

(by the triangular inequality for the absolute value in R)

= |x − y| − 1 = p(x, y).

2.3 Strong Partial Metric

DNA strands, proteins and words are all examples of ﬁnite sequences generated from a ﬁnite alphabet

A. A generic question is: Given two ﬁnite sequences x = hx′

iis

i=1 and y = hy′

jit

j=1, how similar are these two

sequences?

In the case of DNA for example, the alphabet A = {C, G, A, T }. While studying mutation from a sequence

x = hx′

iis

i=1 to a sequence y = hy′

jit

j=1, it becomes important to come up with a measure that can eﬀectively

compare partial DNA strands. One such measure is the following commonly used scoring scheme [31] :

9

We ﬁrst align two given words by inserting gaps so that their lengths match. Formally we adjoin the

symbol −, called a gap to form a new alphabet A⋆ = A ∪ {−} where − /∈ A. Obviously more than one

alignment of words is possible: We consider one such alignment L where we represent x in the alignment

by hxiin

i=1 and y by hyiin

i=1. Fixing α′, β′, γ′ ∈ R we then do a letter-by-letter comparison while assigning
a score to each of four distinct possibilities. Namely, a score of zero is assigned if both letters are −. The

score γ′ is assigned if only one of the letters is in A. The score α′ is assigned if the two letters match (are

the same) and are in A. The score β′ is assigned if the two letters mismatch (are distinct) and are both in

A. Then these scores are summed up to assign a total score h′

L(x, y). Finally

s′(x, y) = max{h′

L(x, y)|L is an alignment}

denotes the highest possible score of all alignments of x and y. Then s′(x, y) is used as a measure of similarity

or dissimilarity of the two words. As an example, assume

α′ = +1, β′ = −1 and γ′ = −2.

Therefore, the total score of the pair (CGATC, CAGA) for the particular alignment

is

− C

T

0 +1 −2 +1 −2 −1 −2

0 + 1 − 2 + 1 − 2 − 1 − 2 = −5.

It is not hard to show that the best possible score for this pair of words is −2 arising from the alignment

(CGATC and C—AGA).

In our conventional view of metrics, we need a scoring function s in which closeness is indicated by smaller

numbers in the usual ordering of R. For that reason in [3], we investigate the function s(x, y) = −s′(x, y)

and from it derive the axioms for a strong partial metric. And hence in the example above, the score given

by the best alignment becomes +2:

C

Remark 2.3.1. As mentioned above, the diﬀerence between the scoring we are investigating and the one

presented in [31] is that we are taking the negative of their score i.e.

s(x, y) = −s′(x, y).

10

Deﬁnition 2.3.2. A strong partial metric s on a set X is a function s : X × X → R satisfying the

following axioms:

For all x, y, z ∈ X,

(s-lbnd): s(x, x) < s(x, y), for x 6= y.

(s-sym): s(x, y) = s(y, x).

(s-inq): s(x, y) ≤ s(x, z) + s(z, y) − s(z, z).

Notice that a separation axiom (s-sep) is hidden in (s-lbnd) as:

s(x, y) ≤ s(x, x) ⇐⇒ x = y.

Clearly a strong partial metric is a partial metric. Therefore, a strong partial metric s deﬁnes a metric d as

deﬁned by Lemma 2.2.1.

Example 2.3.3. (Shifted Metric):

Let d : X × X → R be a metric deﬁned on a set X. For a real number r, let sr : X × X → R be deﬁned as

sr(x, y) = d(x, y) + r.

Then sr is a strong partial metric on X.

Proof: Let x, y, z ∈ X.

Proof of (s-lbnd): From (m-lbnd) and (m-sep) we get if x 6= y then d(x, x) = 0 < d(x, y). Hence,

giving us that

d(x, x) + r < d(x, y) + r

sr(x, x) < sr(x, y).

Proof of (s-sym): From (m-sym) we get

sr(x, y) = d(x, y) + r = d(y, x) + r = sr(y, x).

Proof of (s-inq): From (m-inq) we know that

Adding r to both sides we get that

d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y).

d(x, y) + r ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y) + r.

From (m-sep), we know that d(x, x) = 0. With the above we deduce that

d(x, y) + r ≤ d(x, z) + r + d(y, z) + r + d(x, x) − r.

Finally we use the deﬁnition of sr to obtain

sr(x, y) ≤ sr(x, z) + sr(z, y) − sr(z, z).

(cid:3)

Example 2.3.4. (Positive Real Line):

Consider X to be the set of all positive real numbers. Let s : X × X → R be the function deﬁned by setting :

s(x, x) = x and s(x, y) = x + y for x 6= y.

Then s is a strong partial metric on X.

Proof: Let x, y, z ∈ X.

The proof of (s-lbnd) and (s-sym) are quite straight forward.

Proof of (s-inq): There are four cases.

Case 1: If x = y = z then

s(x, y) = x = x + x − x = s(x, z) + s(y, z) − s(z, z).

Case 2: If x = y and y 6= z then

s(x, y) = x ≤ x + x + z = x + z + y + z − z = s(x, z) + s(y, z) − s(z, z).

Case 3: If x 6= y and x = z then

s(x, y) = x + y = x + y + z − z = s(x, z) + s(y, z) − s(z, z).

Case 4: If x 6= y, y 6= z, and z 6= x then

s(x, y) = x + y ≤ x + z + y = x + z + y + z − z ≤ s(x, z) + s(y, z) − s(z, z).

(cid:3)

As in Bio-informatics [31], we try to ﬁnd out how similar (similarity as measured by the partial metric s)

are the two ﬁnite sequences x = hx′

j=1 . For the convenience of the reader, we restate the

iis

i=1 and y = hy′

jit

deﬁnition of our scoring function s.

Deﬁnition 2.3.5. Consider X to be the set of ﬁnite sequences generated by a ﬁnite alphabet A. First we

augment the alphabet A by adding a gap element − i.e. A⋆ = A ∪ {−} where − /∈ A. Then for α, β, γ ∈ R,

we deﬁne a scoring function s : X × X → R by following the blueprint presented in the introduction of

Section 2.3. For each x, y ∈ X, we use “deletions” and “insertions” (called InDels or gaps) to align the

two sequences so that their lengths match i.e. we represent x by hxiin

i=1 and y by hyiin

i=1. We denote this

alignment L. We then compare the ith terms and assign a score h(L,i)(x, y) in the manner below:

Letter-by-letter comparison Terminology

A Relay will have no eﬀect in comparing these two sequences. That is why it is given a score of zero. The

best score s(x, y) is attained when we get the alignment with the smallest possible score i.e.

hL(x, y) = s(x, y).

s(x, y) = min{hL(x, y)|L is an alignment }.

We call s(x, y) the score of the pair (x, y).

We should note that more than one possible alignment may give us the best score, but the score itself

is unique.

Remark 2.3.6. In [31], the “best score” s′(x, y) is given by taking the score of the alignment L that gives

us the biggest value of h′

L(x, y). Thus in [31], s′(x, y) = −s(x, y) and the relative letter-by-letter scores are

taken as α′ = −α, β′ = −β and γ′ = −γ.

Notation 2.3.7. From this point forward, we will denote h(L,i)(x, y) and hL(x, y) by hi(x, y) and h(x, y)

respectively when it is clear to which alignment L we are referring.

To ensure s is a strong partial metric we need to require that a Match is strictly our most favorable

occurrence. A Mismatch is at least as good as two InDels and a Relay is strictly better than an InDel.

Lemma 2.3.1. Consider X the set of ﬁnite sequences generated from the ﬁnite alphabet A. Let s : X×X → R

be the scoring function in Deﬁnition 2.3.5. If α < min{β, γ, 0}, β ≤ 2γ and γ is strictly positive then s is a

strong partial metric.

Proof: Let x, y, z ∈ X.

Proof of (s-lbnd): We compare the sequences after optimally aligning them. I.e. s(x, y) = h(x, y) where

we represent x and y by hxiin

i=1 and hyiin

i=1 respectively. For all i ∈ {1, ..., n}

(xi, yi)

hi(x, x)

si(x, y) Comparison

xi = yi ∈ A

xi ∈ A and yi = −

xi, yi ∈ A but xi 6= yi

Thus, for all i ∈ {1, ....., n} hi(x, x) ≤ si(x, y). Now since x 6= y then there exists an io such that si(x, y) 6= α.

Since a relay has a score of 0 then for these particular representations of x and y we have

s(x, x) = h(x, x) =

n

i=1

hi(x, x) <

n

i=1

si(x, y) = s(x, y).

Hence, s(x, x) < s(x, y) for x 6= y.

Proof of (s-inq): To compare three sequences x, y and z, we are going to optimally align x with z and y

13

with z by adding the necessary InDels and Relays so that they all have the same length.

Before giving the formal proof of (s-inq) we give a simple example illustrating this step. Consider x =

CGT , y = AGAGT and z = CAGC. Now for some scoring scheme, assume the optimal alignment of x to z

and y to z is given below

and

x : C − G − T

z : C A G C −

y : − A G A G T

z : C A G − − C

By using Relays we can amend the above alignments such that the representations of x, y and z have the

same length. Also note that a relay has a score of zero, hence, s(x, z) and s(y, z) may be computed using the

representations of x, y and z in the box below. Here a gap in either representation of z above appears as a

gap in the representation of z below.

x : C − G − − − T

y : − A G A G T −

z : C A G − − C −

As the example above demonstrates, we may consider x, y and z having the same representations length

hxiin

i=1, respectively and optimally aligned to z. Then

i=1, hyiin

i=1and hziin

and

s(z, z) = h(z, z)

s(x, z) = h(x, z) =

s(y, z) = h(y, z) =

n

i=1

hi(x, z)

hi(x, y).

This leaves us with x and y not necessarily optimally aligned but s(x, y) ≤ h(x, y).

We now move to prove that

h(x, y) ≤ h(x, z) + h(y, z) − h(z, z) = s(x, z) + s(y, z) − s(z, z).

We do this term by term, thus ten cases arise:

14

Case 1

Case 2

Case 3

Case 4

xi = yi, zi ∈ A with zi distinct from xi

xi = yi ∈ A, and zi = −

xi, yi, zi ∈ A and all three are distinct

xi = zi, yi ∈ A with yi distinct from xi

Case 5

xi and yi are distinct elements of A, and zi = −

Case 6

xi = −, and yi = zi ∈ A

Case 7

yi and zi are distinct elements of A, and xi = −

Case 8

Case 9

Case 10

xi = zi = −, and yi ∈ A

xi = yi = −, and zi ∈ A

xi = yi = zi = −

We remind the reader that α < min{β, γ, 0}, β ≤ 2γ and γ > 0

Case 1: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = β + β − α and hi(x, y) = α.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) since α < β.

Case 2: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = γ + γ − 0 and hi(x, y) = α.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) since γ > 0 and, therefore, α < 0 < 2γ.

Case 3: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = β + β − α and hi(x, y) = β.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) since α < β.

Case 4: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = α + β − α and hi(x, y) = β.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z).

Case 5: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = γ + γ − 0 and hi(x, y) = β.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) since β ≤ 2γ.

Case 6: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = γ + α − α and hi(x, y) = γ.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z).

Case 7: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = γ + β − α and hi(x, y) = γ.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) since α < β.

Case 8: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = 0 + γ − 0 and hi(x, y) = γ.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z).

15

Case 9: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = γ + γ − α and hi(x, y) = 0.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) since γ > 0 and, therefore, α < 0 < 2γ.

Case 10: hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) = 0 + 0 − 0 and hi(x, y) = 0.

Hence, hi(x, y) ≤ hi(x, z) + hi(y, z) − hi(z, z) since α < β.

In fact, Case 10 need not arise when comparing three sequences.

It is a useful tool however when using

multiple alignment schemes discussed in Section 2.6.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.3.8. Lemma 2.3.1 remains valid even if α and β are functions with max{α} < min{β, γ, 0},

max{β} ≤ 2γ, γ > 0, and Case 3 of the triangular inequality holds for distinct xi, yi, zi ∈ A.

Example 2.3.9. (BLOSUM62):

One example of the scoring scheme in Lemma 2.3.1is BLOSUM62[31].

We also note that in the alignment schemes, available in the bio-informatics literature, the letter-by-

letter scores are restricted to:

α < 0, β ≥ 0 and γ ≥ 0.

Hence, β ≤ 2γ and Case 3 are the remaining requirements to check for s to be a strong partial metric in

those schemes.

2.4 G−metric and n − Metric

Many mathematicians attempted to generalize a distance, a functions that assigns values to pairs, to a

function that assigns values to triplets or even to n−tuples. In 1963, G¨ahler[16, 17] attempted a generalization

to triplets by modeling his axioms to mimic the area of the triangle whose vertices are three given points.

While he called the function a 2−metric, we will refer to it as G¨ahler’s 2−metric to avoid any confusion that

may arise from later deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 2.4.1. A G¨ahler’s 2−metric σ on a set X is a function σ : X × X × X → R satisfying the

following axioms:

For all x, y, z, a ∈ X,

(2-lbnd): 0 = σ(x, x, y) ≤ σ(x, y, z).

(2-sym): σ(x, y, z) = σ(Π{x, y, z}),

where Π denotes a permutation on {x, y, z}.

(2-sep): If x 6= y then there is at least one element z ∈ X such that σ(x, y, z) 6= 0.

(2-inq): σ(x, y, z) ≤ σ(x, y, a) + σ(x, a, z) + σ(a, y, z).

In 1988, Ha, Cho and White[18] showed that G¨ahler’s 2−metric is not a generalization of a distance

by giving an example of a metric space which is not a G¨ahler’s 2−metric space and and an example of a

16

G¨ahler’s 2−metric space which is not a metric space. To remedy this, in 1992, Dhage[9] deﬁned a D−metric

by modeling his axioms on the perimeter of the triangle whose vertices are three given points.

Deﬁnition 2.4.2. A D−metric D on a set X is a function D : X × X × X → R satisfying the following

axioms:

For all x, y, z, a ∈ X,

(D-lbnd): 0 ≤ D(x, y, z).

(D-sym): D(x, y, z) = D(P {x, y, z}), where Π denotes a permutation on {x, y, z}.

(D-sep): D(x, y, z) = 0 ⇐⇒ x = y = z

(D-inq): D(x, y, z) ≤ D(x, y, a) + D(x, a, z) + D(a, y, z).

In 2004, Mustafa and Sims[27] showed that most of Dhage’s claims about the structure of a D−metric

space were incorrect. In 2006, Mustapha and Sims[28] modiﬁed Dhage’s axioms by changing (D-inq) and

introducing an additional boundary axiom. They called their function a G-metric.

Deﬁnition 2.4.3. A G−metric G on a set X is a function G : X × X × X → R satisfying the following

axioms:

For all x, y, z, a ∈ X,

(G-lbnd): 0 < G(x, x, y) ≤ G(x, y, z),

for x 6= y and y 6= z ,

(G-sym): G(x, y, z) = G(Π{x, y, z}),

where Π denotes a permutation on {x, y, z}.

(G-sep): G(x, y, z) = 0 ⇐⇒ x = y = z,

(G-inq): G(x, y, z) ≤ G(x, y, a) + G(a, a, z).

In 2012, Khan[23] extended the Mustafa-Sims G−metric above into what he called a K−metric which

is a function K : X n → R≥0 for n ≥ 2. The notation used is presented in Section 1.6.

Deﬁnition 2.4.4. For n ≥ 2, a K−metric K on a set X is a function K : X n → R satisfying the following

axioms:

For all (hxiin

i=1, a) ∈ X n+1,

(K-lbnd): 0 < K(hx1in−1, x2) ≤ K(hxiin

i=1)

for all distinct elements x1, x2, ..., xn.

(K-sym): K(hxiin

where π is a permutation on {1, ...., n}.

(K-sep): K(hxiin

(K-inq): K(hxiin

i=1),

i=1) = K(hxπ(i)in
i=1) = 0 ⇐⇒ x1 = x2 = x3 = ... = xn,
i=1) ≤ K(hxiin−1
i=1 , a) + K(hain−1, xn).

The K−metric is modeled on the perimeter of an n−simplex (i.e. the sum of the length of the sides of the

n-simplex). For n = 2, the K−metric axioms are just the usual metric axioms. For n = 3, Khan’s deﬁnition

coincides with Mustafa and Sim’s deﬁnition of a G−metric. We found that the axioms Khan proposed were

unnecessarily restrictive. That is why in [2], we proposed the n − Metric. The reader should note the use of

the scripted M to diﬀerentiate it from other generalizations found in the literature.

17

Deﬁnition 2.4.5. For n ≥ 2, an n − Metric M on a set X is a function M : X n → R satisfying the

following axioms:

For all (hxiin

i=1, a) ∈ X n+1,

(n-lbnd): 0 ≤ M (hx1in−1, x2).

(n-sym): M (hxiin

i=1) = M (hxπ(i)in

i=1),

where π is a permutation on {1, ...., n}.

(n-sep): M (hx1in−1, x2) = 0 ⇐⇒ x1 = x2,

(n-inq): M (hxiin

i=1) ≤ M (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + M (hain−1, xn).

Remark 2.4.6. The 2 − Metric, not to be confused with G¨ahler’s 2−metric, is simply a metric. As men-

tioned below a K−metric (see Deﬁnition 2.4.4) is a special case of an n − Metric. Hence, a G−metric (see

Deﬁnition 2.4.3) is a special case of a 3 − Metric.

For n ≥ 3, our n − Metric axioms relax Khan’s K−metric axioms in three ways. First we allow

negative values (see Example 2.4.9 ). The second diﬀerence lies in (n-lbnd) which is a major weakening of

(K-lbnd). Third, our (n-sep) is weaker than (K-sep).

Mustafa and Sims[28] proved several properties of G−metrics. Not all of those properties hold for our

3 − Metric due to our weakened (n-lbnd) condition mentioned above. One property, however,

still holds for a 3 − Metric. We were able to generalize it into a tool for term replacement in the n − Metric

G(a, a, b) ≤ 2G(b, b, a)

case in Theorem 2.4.1.

Theorem 2.4.1. (Term Replacement):

Let M be an n − Metric on a set X. For all hxiin

Proof: This is the case of Corollary 2.4.3 when t = n − 1.

(cid:3)

We now show that each n − Metric on a set X naturally induces a metric on X.

Theorem 2.4.5. (Metric from an n − Metric):

Let M be an n − Metric on a set X. For x, y ∈ X let

d(x, y) = M (y, hxin−1) + M (x, hyin−1).

Then d is a metric on the set X.

Proof: Let x, y, z ∈ X.

Proof of (n-lbnd): From (n-lbnd), we know that M (x, hyin−1) ≥ 0 and M (y, hxin−1) ≥ 0.

Hence, d(x, y) = M (x, hyin−1) + M (y, hxin−1) ≥ 0.

19

Proof of (n-sym): Symmetry of d follows from the symmetry of addition of real numbers.

Proof of (n-sep):

(⇒) From the deﬁnition of d, if d(x, y) = 0 then

M (x, hyin−1) + M (y, hxin−1) = 0.

M (x, hyin−1) = 0 = M (y, hxin−1).

By (n-lbnd)

By (K-sep), x = y.

(⇐) If x = y then M (x, hyin−1) = M (y, hxin−1) = M (hxin) = 0 by (n-sep).

Hence,

d(x, y) = M (y, hxin−1

1

) + M (x, hyin−1

1

) = 0.

Proof of (n-inq): From (n-sym) and (n-inq) we get

M (x, hyin−1) = M (hyin−1, x)

≤ M (hyin−1, z) + M (hzin−1, x)

= M (x, hzin−1) + M (z, hyin−1).

Similarly

Hence,

M (y, hxin−1) ≤ M (y, hzin−1) + M (z, hxin−1).

d(x, y) = M (x, hyin−1) + M (y, hxin−1)

≤ M (x, hzin−1) + M (z, hyin−1) + M (z, hxin−1) + M (y, hzin−1)

= M (x, hzin−1) + M (z, hxin−1) + M (z, hyin−1) + M (y, hzin−1)

= d(x, z) + d(z, y).

(cid:3)

We shall show in Section 3.3 that the topology on X induced by the n−Metric coincides with the topology

on X induced by the metric presented in Theorem 2.4.5.

Example 2.4.8. (Unit n − Metric):

Consider X = R. Let M : X n → R be deﬁned as follows:

Furthermore,

M (a, a, a, a, a) = 0, M (b, b, b, b, b) = 0,

M (a, a, a, a, b) = 3, M (a, b, b, b, b) = 4,

M (a, a, a, b, b) = −1, and M (a, a, b, b, b) = 2.

Then M is a 5 − Metric on the set X.

Proof: (n-lbnd), (n-sym), and (n-sep) are direct results from the deﬁnition of M .

Proof of (n-inq): There are ten cases:

M (a, a, a, a, a) ≤ M (a, a, a, a, b) + M (b, b, b, b, a), since (0 ≤ 3 + 4).

M (a, a, a, a, b) ≤ M (a, a, a, b, b) + M (b, b, b, b, a), since (3 ≤ −1 + 4).

M (a, a, a, a, b) ≤ M (a, a, a, a, a) + M (a, a, a, a, b), since (3 ≤ 0 + 3).

M (a, a, a, b, b) ≤ M (a, a, b, b, b) + M (b, b, b, b, a), since (−1 ≤ 2 + 4).

M (a, a, a, b, b) ≤ M (a, a, a, a, b) + M (a, a, a, a, b), since (−1 ≤ 3 + 3).

M (a, a, b, b, b) ≤ M (a, b, b, b, b) + M (b, b, b, b, a), since (2 ≤ 4 + 4).

M (a, a, b, b, b) ≤ M (a, a, a, b, b) + M (a, a, a, a, b), since (2 ≤ −1 + 3).

M (a, b, b, b, b) ≤ M (b, b, b, b, b) + M (b, b, b, b, a), since (4 ≤ 0 + 4).

M (a, b, b, b, b) ≤ M (a, a, b, b, b) + M (a, a, a, a, b), since (4 ≤ 2 + 3).

M (b, b, b, b, b) ≤ M (a, b, b, b, b) + M (a, a, a, a, b), since (0 ≤ 4 + 3).

2.5 Gp−Metric and Partial n − Metric

In 2011, Zand and Nezhad[33] deﬁned a function which they called a Gp−metric. A Gp− metric acts on

triplets and is in fact a combination of the idea of partial metrics and G−metrics. A partial metric acts on

pairs and has the property where the distance of a point to itself need not be zero. The G−metric on the other

hand, acts on triplets but the distance of a triplet made up of the same point remains zero (G(x, x, x) = 0).

As a generalization of both, the Gp−metric acts on triplets and the distance of a triplet made up of the same

point need not be zero.

Deﬁnition 2.5.1. A Gp−metric Gp on a set X is a function Gp : X 3 → R satisfying the following axioms:

For all x, y, z, a ∈ X,

(Gp-lbnd): 0 ≤ Gp(x, x, x) ≤ Gp(x, x, y) ≤ Gp(x, y, z).

22

(Gp-sym): Gp(x, y, z) = Gp(Π{x, y, z}),

where Π denotes a permutation on {x, y, z}.

(Gp-sep): Gp(x, y, z) = Gp(x, x, x) = Gp(y, y, y) = Gp(z, z, z) ⇐⇒ x = y = z.

(Gp-inq): Gp(x, y, z) ≤ Gp(x, y, a) + Gp(a, a, z) − Gp(a, a, a).

(Gp-lbnd) restricts Gp to have exclusively nonnegative values. (Gp-lbnd) combined with (Gp-sym) forces

Gp(x, x, y) ≤ Gp(y, y, x) by taking z = y and, hence, Gp(x, x, y) = Gp(y, y, x). In the previous section, and

while investigating the G−metric, we found (G-lbnd) to be too restrictive. We proposed the n − Metric such

that (n-lbnd) of the 3 − Metric was a weakening of (G-lbnd). We now proceed to generalize the n − Metric

into what we call a partial n − Metric.

Deﬁnition 2.5.2. A partial n − Metric P on a set X is a function P : X n → R satisfying the following

axioms:

For all (hxiin

i=1, a) ∈ X n+1,

(Pn-lbnd): P (hx1in) ≤ P (hx1in−1, x2).

(Pn-sym): P (hxiin

i=1) = P (hxπ(i)in

i=1),

where π is a permutation on {1, ...., n}.

(Pn-sep): P (hx1in−1, x2) = P (hx1in) and P (hx2in−1, x1) = P (hx2in) ⇐⇒ x1 = x2.

(Pn-inq): P (hxiin

i=1) ≤ P (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + P (hain−1, xn) − P (hain).

Remark 2.5.3. A Gp−metric is a special case of a partial 3 − Metric. A partial 2 − Metric is the same as

a partial metric.

The cornerstone of the above generalization is to allow P (hx1in) to have non-zero values. The axioms

were amended to ﬂow with this adjustment. Note that in our proposed partial 3 − Metric, our (Pn-lbnd) is

weaker than the (Gp-lbnd), allowing P to have negative values. This weakening also allows P (x, x, y) and

P (y, y, x) to be related only by the triangular inequality. i.e. P (x, x, y) and P (y, y, x) need not be equal.

We start by generalizing Theorem 2.4.1 to the partial n − Metric case.

Theorem 2.5.1. (Term Replacement):

Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. For all hxiin

i=1, hyiin

i=1 ∈ X n and for t ∈ {1, ......., n},

P (hxiin

[P (hyjin−1, xj ) − P (hyjin)].

Proof: Let hxiin

Let t ∈ {2, ...., n − 1} and assume the inequality holds for t − 1. Then

(cid:3)

Remark 2.5.4. As does Theorem 2.4.1, Theorem 2.5.1 gives rise to useful replacement tools which are

presented in the three corollaries below.

Corollary 2.5.2. Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. For all hxiin

i=1, hyiin

i=1 ∈ X n

P (hxiin

i=1) ≤ P (hyiin

i=1) +

n

X

j=1

[P (hyjin−1, xj) − P (hyjin)].

Proof: This is the case of Theorem 2.5.1 when t = n.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.5.3. Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. Then for a, b ∈ X and t ∈ {1, ......., n},

P (hait, hbin−t) ≤ tP (hbin−1, a) − (t − 1)P (hbin).

Proof: The proof follows from Corollary 2.5.2 where hxiin

i=1 = (hait, hbin−t) and hyjin

j=1 = hbin we get

P (hait, hbin−t) ≤ P (hbin) +

n

= tP (hbin−1, a) − (t − 1)P (hbin).

(cid:3)

The above corollary hints to as why we were able to choose such a simple (Pn-sep) axiom. A very useful

corollary is when t = n − 1.

Corollary 2.5.4. Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. Then for a, b ∈ X,

P (hain−1, b) ≤ (n − 1)P (hbin−1, a) − (n − 2)P (hbin).

Proof: This is the case of Corollary 2.4.3 when t = n − 1.

(cid:3)

Similarly to the case of an n − Metric, every partial n − Metric on a set X induces a metric on X. Thus

Theorem 2.4.5 is a special case of Theorem 2.5.5 where for every x ∈ X, P (hxin) = 0.

24

Theorem 2.5.5. (Metric from Partial n − Metric):

Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. For x, y ∈ X let

d(x, y) = P (y, hxin−1) − P (hxin) + P (x, hyin−1) − P (hyin).

Then d is a metric on the set X.

Proof: Let x, y, z ∈ X.

Proof of (m-bnd): From (Pn-lbnd) we have

P (hxin) ≤ P (y, hxin−1) and P (hyin) ≤ P (x, hyin−1).

Therefore,

d(x, y) = P (y, hxin−1) − P (hxin) + P (x, hyin−1) − P (hyin) ≥ 0.

Proof of (n-sym): Symmetry of d follows from the symmetry of addition of real numbers.

Proof of (n-sep):

(⇐) From the deﬁnition of d we get

d(x, x) = P (hxin) − P (hxin) + P (hxin) − P (hxin) = 0.

(⇒) If d(x, y) = 0, then

P (y, hxin−1) − P (hxin

1 ) + P (x, hyin−1

1

) − P (hyin

1 ) = 0.

From (Pn-lbnd) we know that

P (y, hxin−1) − P (hxin

1 ) ≥ 0 and P (x, hyin−1) − P (hyin) ≥ 0.

Therefore,

which means that

P (y, hxin−1) − P (< x >n) = 0 and P (x, < y >n−1) − P (< y >n) = 0,

P (y, < x >n−1) = P (< x >n) and P (x, < y >n−1) = P (< y >n).

From (Pn-sep) we deduce that x = y.

Proof of (n-inq): From (Pn-inq) and (Pn-sym) we get

d(x, y) = P (y, hxin−1) − P (hxin) + P (x, hyin−1) − P (hyin)

25

= P (hxin−1, y) − P (hxin) + P (hyin−1, x) − P (hyin)

≤ P (hxin−1, z) + P (hzin−1, y) − P (hzin) − P (hxin) + P (hyin−1, z) + P (hzin−1, x) − P (hzin) − P (hyin)

= P (x, hzin−1) − P (hzin) + P (z, hxin−1) − P (hxin) + P (y, hzin−1) − P (hzin) + P (z, hyin−1) − P (hyin)

= d(x, z) + d(z, y).

(cid:3)

Example 2.5.5. ({−1, 1}−Discrete Partial n − Metric):

Consider X to be any arbitrary set. Let P : X n → R be deﬁned by:

For all hxiin

i=1 ∈ X n, P (hxiin

i=1) =

−1




1

if x1 = x2 = ... = xn.

otherwise.

Then P is a partial n − Metric on the set X.

Example 2.5.6. (Maximum Partial n − Metric):

Consider the set X to be a subset of R. For all hxiin

i=1 ∈ X let

P (hxiin

i=1) = max{xi}n

i=1.

Then P is a partial n − Metric on the set X.

Proof: Let (hxiin

i=1, a) ∈ X n+1.

Proof of (Pn-bnd): a ≤ max{a, x1} and, hence, P (hain) ≤ P (hain−1, x1).

Proof of (Pn-sym): The maximum of a ﬁnite set does not change under the permutation of the set.

Proof of (Pn-sep):

(⇐)is trivial.

(⇒) If

then

Therefore, x1 = x2.

P (hx1in−1, x2) = P (hx1in) and P (hx2in−1, x1) = P (hx2in),

max{x1, x2} = x1 and max{x1, x2} = x2.

Proof of (Pn-inq): Without loss of generality and due to (Pn-sym), we may assume that x1 ≤ x2 ≤ .... ≤ xn.

Hence, P (hxiin

i=1) = xn. Three cases arise:

Case 1: Suppose a ≤ xn−1 ≤ xn. Then

P (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + P (hain−1, xn) − P (hain) = xn−1 + xn − a ≥ xn = P (hxiin

i=1).

26

Case 2: Suppose xn−1 ≤ a ≤ xn. Then

P (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + P (hain−1, xn) − P (hain) = a + xn − a = xn = P (hxiin

i=1).

Case 3: Suppose xn−1 ≤ xn ≤ a. Then

P (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + P (xn, hain−1) − P (hain) = a + a − a = a ≥ xn = P (hxiin

i=1).

Therefore, for all (hxiin

i=1, a) ∈ X n+1,

P (hxiin

i=1) ≤ P (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + P (hain−1, xn) − P (hain).

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.5.6. (Partial n − Metric from a partial metric):

2.6 Strong Partial n − Metric

In Section 2.3 we presented the strong partial metric, a generalized metric aimed at simulating scoring

schemes set up to compare two ﬁnite sequences.

In bio-informatics[31], we have scoring schemes which allow us to align and compare multiple DNA

strands at the same time. We call those types of schemes multiple sequence alignment schemes. That is why

in 2015[2], we introduced a stronger version of the partial n − Metric by combining (Pn-lbnd) and (Pn-sep)

into a stronger axiom. The result is a generalized metric capable of emulating a multiple sequence alignment

schemes for a set of ﬁnite sequences generated from a ﬁnite alphabet. We called it a strong partial n−Metric.

Deﬁnition 2.6.1. A strong partial n − Metric S on a set X is a function S : X n → R satisfying the

following axioms:

For all (hxiin

i=1, a) ∈ X n+1,

(Sn-lbnd): S(hx1in) < S(hx1in−1, x2).

(Sn-sym): S(hxiin

(Sn-inq): S(hxiin

i=1) = S(hxπ(i)in
i=1) ≤ S(hxiin−1

i=1), where π is a permutation on {1, ...., n}.

i=1 , a) + S(hain−1, xn) − S(hain).

Remark 2.6.2. A strong partial 2 − Metric is a strong partial metric.

Notice that an (Sn-sep) is hidden in (Sn-lbnd) as

S(hx1in−1, x2) = S(hx1in) ⇐⇒ x1 = x2.

Clearly, a strong partial n−Metric S on a set X is a partial n−Metric on X. Hence, as in Theorem 2.5.5,

S induces a metric d on X deﬁned as follows:

For all x, y ∈ X

d(x, y) = S(y, hxin−1) − S(hxin) + S(x, hyin−1) − S(hyin).

Example 2.6.3. (Shifted n − Metric):

Let M : X n → R be an n − Metric deﬁned on a set X. For any r ∈ R, let Sr : X n → R be deﬁned by:

Sr(hxiin

i=1) = M (hxiin

i=1) + r.

Then Sr is a strong partial n − Metric on the set X.

Proof: Let (hxiin

i=1, a) ∈ X n+1.

28

Proof of (Sn-lbnd): For a 6= x1 ,

Sr(hain) = M (hain) + r = r.

From (n-lbnd) and (n-sep) and since a 6= x1 we get

M (hain−1, x1) > 0.

Hence,

Sr(hain) = r < M (hain−1, x1) + r = Sr(hain−1, x1).

Proof of (Sn-sym): Follows directly from (n-sym).

Proof of (Sn-inq): From (n-inq) we know that

M (hxiin

i=1) ≤ M (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + M (hain−1, xn)

By (n-sep), M (hain) = 0. Therefore,

= M (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + M (hain−1, xn) − M (hain).

Sr(hxiin

i=1) = M (hxiin

i=1) + r

= M (hxiin

i=1) + 2r − r − M (hain)

≤ M (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + M (hain−1, xn) + 2r − r − M (hain)

= [M (hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + r] + [M (hain−1

1

, xn) + r] − [M (hain

i=1) + r]

= Sr(hxiin−1

i=1 , a) + Sr(hain−1, xn) − Sr(hain).

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.6.1. (Strong partial n − Metric from a strong partial metric):

Every strong partial metric s on a set X naturally deﬁnes a strong partial n−metric S on X as follows:

For all hxiin

i=1 ∈ X n,

S(hxiin

i=1) =

n

X

t=2

t−1

X

i=1

s(xi, xt).

Proof: For the proof of (Sn-sym) and (Sn-inq), please refer to Example 2.5.5.

Proof of (Sn-lbnd): Let a and x1 be two distinct elements of X. Using the deﬁnition of S(hain) we

get

n

t−1

X
t=2
By (s-lbnd) s(a, a) < s(a, x1) and, hence,

S(hain) =

s(a, a) =

n−1

s(a, x1) = S(hain−1, x1).

(cid:3)

The above example is a general form of a multiple sequence alignment scheme[31], since each pairwise

alignment scheme is a strong partial metric. (see Example 2.3.9.)

Topology

In 1914, Hausdorﬀ[19] used set theory to generalize a Euclidean space while retaining concepts such as

continuity, convergence and connectedness. He used the metric deﬁned by Fr´echet[15] (see Deﬁnition 2.1.1)

to generate a topological space called a metric space. The deﬁnitions and lemmas in this subsection and in

Section 3.1, with the exception of Deﬁnition 3.1.4, can be found in [26] and every book on undergraduate

topology.

Deﬁnition 3.0.1. A topology T on a set X is a subset of P(X) satisfying the following axioms:

Oi ∈ T . I.e. an arbitrary union of elements of T is an element of T .

i=1 ⊆ T and n is a positive integer, then

n

Ti=1

Oi ∈ T . I.e. a ﬁnite intersection of elements of T

(R1): ∅ ∈ T and X ∈ T .
(R2): If {Oi}i∈I ⊆ T then Si∈I
(R3): If {Oi}n

is an element of T .

We call the pair (X, T ) a topological space.

Deﬁnition 3.0.2. The open sets of a topological space (X, T ) are the elements of T . While the closed

sets are the complement of the elements of T . I.e.

O ∈ X is called an open set of X ⇐⇒ O ∈ T .

F ∈ X is called a closed set of X ⇐⇒ X − F ∈ T .

Deﬁnition 3.0.3. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. For each x in X, every open set containing x is called

an open neighborhood of x.

Lemma 3.0.1. Let (X, T ) be a topological space and the set U ⊆ X. U is an open set if and only if for each

x ∈ U there exists an open neighborhood Vx of x such that Vx ⊆ U .

When considering a topological space one usually does not need to deal with all open sets. Lemma 3.0.1

makes it suﬃcient to deal with a sub-collection of open sets called a basis. A key feature of a basis of a

topology is that it can be used to generate all open sets[30].

30

Deﬁnition 3.0.4. A basis B on a set X is a subset of P(X) satisfying the following axioms:

(B1): For all x ∈ X, there exists B ∈ B such that x ∈ B.

(B2): For all B1, B2 ∈ B and for each element x ∈ B1 ∩ B2, there exists B3 ∈ B such that x ∈ B3 ⊆ B1 ∩ B2.

Given a basis B on a set X, let TB = {S C | C ∈ B}S{∅}. Then TB is a topology on X [26]. We say

that TB is the topology generated by B.

In the case of metric spaces the following well-known technique is used [25] to prove that a certain subset

of P(X) is a basis.

Lemma 3.0.2. Given a set X and a function b : R>0 × X → P(X) satisfying the conditions:

(b1): For all x ∈ X and for each α ∈ R>0, x ∈ b(α, x).

(b2): For all x ∈ X and for all positive real numbers α ≤ β, b(α, x) ⊆ b(β, x).
(b3): For all x, y ∈ X and α ∈ R>0 such that y ∈ b(α, x), there exists a positive real number ǫ such that

b(ǫ, y) ⊆ b(α, x).

Then b(R>0 × X) is a basis on X.

Deﬁnition 3.0.5. Let (X, T ) be a topological space and a set A ⊆ X. The closure of A, denoted ¯A or

Cl(A), is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.

Lemma 3.0.3. Let (X, T ) be a topological space and a set A ⊆ X. Cl(A) is the smallest closed set containing

A.

Lemma 3.0.4. Let (X, T ) be a topological space and a set A ⊆ X. x ∈ Cl(A) if and only if every open

neighborhood of x intersects A.

To prove Banach-type ﬁxed point theorems on a topological space, we need to be able to topologically

distinguish distinct points.

Deﬁnition 3.0.6. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is T0 if for every two distinct

elements x and y of X, there exists an open set U in T such that either

[x ∈ U and y /∈ U ] or [x /∈ U and y ∈ U ].

Deﬁnition 3.0.7. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is T1 if for every two distinct

elements x and y of X, there exist two open sets U and V in T such that

[x ∈ U and y /∈ U ] and [x /∈ V and y ∈ V ].

Deﬁnition 3.0.8. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is T2 (or Hausdorﬀ) if for every

two distinct elements x and y of X, there exists two open sets U and V in T such that

x ∈ U, y ∈ V and U ∩ V = ∅.

31

Clearly if a topological space is T2 then it is T1 and if a topological space is T1 then it is T0 [26].

Deﬁnition 3.0.9. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is ﬁrst countable if for every

x ∈ X, there exists a countable collection Bx = {Bi}i∈N ⊆ T such that for each open set U containing x there

is an index i ∈ N with x ∈ Bi ⊆ U . We call Bx a countable local basis at x.

Finally we introduce the notion of “partial ordering” on topologies of on a particular domain.

Deﬁnition 3.0.10. Let (X, T ) and (X, T ′) be two topological spaces.

We say T is coarser than T ′ or T ′ is ﬁner than T if T ⊆ T ′. Alternatively, we may denote it as

(X, T ) is coarser than (X, T ′) or (X, T ′) is ﬁner than (X, T ).

In the sections to follow, we will use the generalized metrics deﬁned in Chapter 2 to deﬁne topologies,

thus, giving us the structure needed for the study of convergence.

3.1 Metric Space

Deﬁnition 3.1.1. Let d be a metric on a set X. For each element x ∈ X and positive real number ǫ, the

d-open ball around x of radius ǫ is

Bd

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | d(x, y) < ǫ}.

Lemma 3.1.1. Let d be a metric on a set X. The collection of all d-open balls on X, Bd = {Bd

ǫ (x)}ǫ∈R>0

x∈X

forms a basis on X.

Deﬁnition 3.1.2. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is a metric space if there exists

a metric d on X such that

(See Deﬁnition 3.0.4.)

T = TBd .

Notation 3.1.3. Let d be a metric on a set X. We denote the topological space (X, TBd ) by (X, d).

Lemma 3.1.2. Every metric space (X, T ) is ﬁrst countable.

Lemma 3.1.3. Every metric space (X, d) is T2.

Deﬁnition 3.1.4. Let (X, d) be a metric space. For each element x ∈ X and positive real number ǫ, the

d-gilded ball around x of radius ǫ is

˜Bd

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | d(x, y) ≤ ǫ}.

Lemma 3.1.4. If (X, d) is a metric space then every d-gilded ball is closed in (X, d).

Remark 3.1.5. In the literature, a d-gilded ball is referred to as a d-closed ball. When discussing a partial

metric p, a p-gilded ball need not be a closed set in the relevant topology. Hence, we chose to change the usual

name to avoid ambiguity.

32

3.2 Partial Metric and Strong Partial Metric Space

Although other possible deﬁnitions were given for an open ball relative to a partial metric [25], we felt

that O’Neill’s deﬁnition [29] is the most natural generalization of a d-open ball into the partial metric case.

Deﬁnition 3.2.1. Let p be a partial metric on a set X. For each element x ∈ X and positive real number

ǫ, the p-open ball around x of radius ǫ is

Bp

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | p(x, y) − p(x, x) < ǫ}.

Matthews ([7]: Deﬁnition 13) noted that

Bp⋆

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | p(x, y) − p(y, y) < ǫ}

is another possible deﬁnition which may give us a totally diﬀerent topology. He also presented us with

Lemma 3.2.1 which is in a fact a special case of our Lemma 3.4.1.

Lemma 3.2.1. Let p be a partial metric on a set X. The collection of all p-open balls on X,

Bp = {Bp

ǫ (x)}ǫ∈R>0

x∈X forms a basis on X.

Proof: Use Lemma 3.0.2.

Deﬁnition 3.2.2. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is a (strong) partial metric space

if there exists a (strong) partial metric p on X such that

(See Deﬁnition 3.0.4.)

T = TBp .

Notation 3.2.3. Let p be a partial metric on a set X. We denote the topological space (X, TBp ) by (X, p).

Lemma 3.2.2. Every partial metric space (X, T ) is ﬁrst countable.

Proof: Trivial.

Lemma 3.2.3. (Matthews[7]) Every partial metric space (X, T ) is T0.

Proof: Let (X, T ) be a partial metric space. By Deﬁnition 3.2.2, let p be a partial metric on X such

that

T = TBp .

Consider two distinct elements x and y in X. From (p-lbnd) and (p-sep) we get

p(x, y) > p(x, x) or p(x, y) > p(y, y).

Then

ǫx = p(x, y) − p(x, x) > 0 or ǫy = p(x, y) − p(y, y) > 0.

33

Without any loss of generality we may assume that ǫx > 0. Hence, Bp

ǫx exists. Additionally

x ∈ Bp

ǫx(x) and y /∈ Bp

ǫx(x)

(cid:3)

Note that a partial metric space need not be T1.

Example 3.2.4. (A partial metric space that is not T1):

Let p be a partial metric on X = R ∪ {a} where a /∈ R as deﬁned in Example 2.2.4 by

p(a, a) = 0, p(a, x) = |x| and p(x, y) = |x − y| − 1.

Then (X, p) is not T1.

Proof: We know that a 6= 0 and for every ǫ ∈ R>0,

p(a, 0) − p(a, a) = 0 − 0 = 0 < ǫ.

Hence, 0 ∈ Bp

ǫ (a).

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2.4. Every strong partial metric space (X, s) is T1.

Proof: Let (X, T ) be a strong partial metric space. By Deﬁnition 3.2.2, let s be a strong partial metric

on X such that

T = TBs.

Consider two distinct elements x and y in X. From (s-lbnd) we get

s(x, y) > s(x, x) and s(x, y) > s(y, y).

Let

Then,

ǫx = s(x, y) − s(x, x) > 0 and ǫy = s(x, y) − s(y, y) > 0.

x ∈ Bs

ǫx(x) , y /∈ Bs

ǫx(x) , y ∈ Bs

ǫy (y) , and x /∈ Bs

ǫy (y).

(cid:3)

Note that a strong partial metric space need not be T2.

Example 3.2.5. (A strong partial metric space that is not T2):

Let s be the strong partial metric on X = (0, +∞) deﬁned in Example 2.3.4 by

Then (X, s) is not T2.

s(x, y) =

x

if x = y.

x + y

if x 6= y.




34

Proof: For each element x ∈ X and positive real number ǫ,

Bs

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | s(x, y) − s(x, x) < ǫ} = {x} ∪ {y ∈ X | y < ǫ}.

Consider two distinct elements x and y in X and two positive real numbers ǫ and δ.

Let z < min{ǫ, δ} then z ∈ Bs

ǫ (x) ∩ Bs

δ (y).

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.2.6. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space. For each element x ∈ X and positive real number ǫ,

the p-gilded ball around x of radius ǫ is

˜Bp

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | p(x, y) − p(x, x) ≤ ǫ}.

The next example shows that if p is a partial metric on a set X, a p-gilded ball need not be closed in

(X, p).

Example 3.2.7. (p-gilded but not closed ball):

Let s be the strong partial metric on X = (0, +∞) deﬁned in Example 2.3.4 by



Then, for each x ∈ X and positive real number ǫ, ˜Bs

s(x, y) =

x

x + y

if x = y.

if x 6= y.

ǫ (x) is not closed in (X, s).

Proof: Let x ∈ X and ǫ a positive real number. Then

˜Bs

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | y ≤ ǫ} ∪ {x}.

For each y ∈ X and every positive real number δ,

∅ 6= (0, min{ǫ, δ}) ⊆ Bs

δ (y) ∩ ˜Bs

ǫ (x).

Hence, y is in the closure of ˜Bs

ǫ (x). I.e. the closure of ˜Bs

ǫ (x) is X and, therefore, ˜Bs

ǫ (x) is not closed in

(X, s).

(cid:3)

3.3 G−metric and n − Metric Space

Mustapha and Sims[28] deﬁned a topology on a set X having a G−metric (see Deﬁnition 2.4.1). Later

Khan[23] used the K−metric, a stronger version of our n − Metric (see Deﬁnition 2.4.2), on a set X to deﬁne

a topology on X. He called this topological space a K−metric space [2].

In this section we will develop the n − Metric space, which is in fact a generalization of the G−metric

space and the K−metric space. We will also prove that an n − Metric space is simply a metric space. Hence,

we will be dropping n − Metrics as of Chapter 4.

35

Deﬁnition 3.3.1. Let M be an n − Metric on a set X. For each element x ∈ X and positive real number

ǫ, the M-open ball around x of radius ǫ is

BM

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | M (hxin−1, y) < ǫ}.

Note that this is not the only possible deﬁnition. For example

BM ⋆

ǫ

(x) = {y ∈ X | M (hyin−1, x)) < ǫ}

is another possible deﬁnition but which will still generate the same metric topology.

Lemma 3.3.1. Let M be an n − Metric on a set X. The collection of all M-open balls on X,

BM = {BM

ǫ (x)}ǫ∈R>0

x∈X forms a basis on X.

Proof: Consider the function b : R>0 × X → P(X) given by b(ǫ, x) = BM

ǫ (x). We now check that b

satisﬁes the conditions of Lemma 3.0.2.

(b1): For every x ∈ X, by (M-sep) we know that M (hxin−1, x) = 0. Hence, for each positive real number ǫ,

x ∈ BM

ǫ (x).

(b2): Clearly, if 0 < δ ≤ ǫ then BM

δ (x) ⊆ BM

ǫ (x) for each x ∈ X by the transitivity of the order on R. Hence,

b(δ, x) ⊆ b(ǫ, x).

(b3): For every x ∈ X and y ∈ BM

ǫ (x), we know that M (hxin−1, y) < ǫ. Let δ = ǫ − M (hxin−1, y). For each

element z ∈ BM

δ (y) (i.e M (hyin−1, z) < δ), by (M-inq) we get

M (hxin−1, z) ≤ M (hxin−1, y) + M (hyin−1, z) < M (hxin−1, y) + δ = ǫ

and, hence,

Thus, z ∈ BM

ǫ (x) and BM

δ (y) ⊆ BM

ǫ (x).

M (hxin−1, z) < ǫ.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.3.2. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is an n − Metric space if there

exists an n − Metric M on X such that

T = TBM .

Notation 3.3.3. Let M be an n − Metric on a set X. We denote the topological space (X, TBM ) by (X, M ).

Theorem 3.3.2. Every n − Metric space (X, T ) is a metric space.

Proof: Let (X, T ) be an n − Metric space. By Deﬁnition 3.4.2, let M be an n − Metric on X such that

In Theorem 2.4.5 we proved that the function

T = TBM .

d(x, y) = M (hxin−1, y) + M (hyin−1, x)

36

is a metric on X.

First we prove that (X, d) is ﬁner than (X, M ). For each element x ∈ X and y ∈ Bd

ǫ (x) we know that

I.e.

From (M-lbnd) we know that

and, hence,

d(x, y) < ǫ.

M (hxin−1, y) + M (x, hyin−1) < ǫ.

M (x, hyin−1) ≥ 0

M (y, hxin−1) ≤ M (hxin−1, y) + M (x, hyin−1) < ǫ.

Thus, y ∈ BM

ǫ (x) and, as a result, Bd

ǫ (x) ⊆ BM

ǫ (x).

Similarly we prove that (X, M ) is ﬁner than (X, d). For each element x ∈ X and y ∈ BM

ǫ (x) we

know that

M (hxin−1, y) < ǫ.

Let δ = ǫ

n . For each element y ∈ BM

δ (x) we know that

M (hxin−1, y) < δ.

From Corollary 2.4.4 we get

Hence,

M (x, hyin−1) ≤ (n − 1)M (hxin−1, y).

d(x, y) ≤ M (hxin−1, y) + (n − 1)M (hxin−1, y)

Thus, y ∈ Bd

ǫ (x) and BM

δ (x) ⊆ Bd

ǫ (x).

= nM (hxin−1, y) < nδ = ǫ.

(cid:3)

3.4 Partial n − Metric and Strong Partial n − Metric Space

As mentioned in Chapter 2, a partial n − Metric is a generalization of a partial metric and an n − Metric.

Unlike in the chapters to come, no special techniques are needed other than the ones presented in Section 3.2

and Section 3.3. Hence, we will present our statements without proofs.

Deﬁnition 3.4.1. Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. For each element x ∈ X and positive real

number ǫ, the P-open ball around x of radius ǫ is

BP

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | P (hxin−1, y) − P (hxin) < ǫ}.

37

Note that this is not the only possible deﬁnition. For example

BP ⋆

ǫ

(x) = {y ∈ X | P (hyin−1, x) − P (hyin) < ǫ}

is another possible deﬁnition which may give us a totaly diﬀerent topology.

Lemma 3.4.1. Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. The collection of all P-open balls on X,

BP = {BP

ǫ (x)}ǫ∈R>0

x∈X forms a basis on X.

Deﬁnition 3.4.2. Let (X, T ) be a topological space. We say that (X, T ) is a (strong) partial n − Metric

space if there exists a (strong) partial n − Metric P on X such that

T = TBP .

Notation 3.4.3. Let P be a partial n − Metric on a set X. We denote the topological space (X, TBP ) by

(X, P ).

Lemma 3.4.2. Every partial n − Metric space (X, T ) is ﬁrst countable.

Lemma 3.4.3. Every partial n − Metric space (X, T ) is T0.

Note that a partial n − Metric space need not be T1.

Example 3.4.4. (A partial n − Metric space that is not T1):

For n = 2, a partial n − Metric space is simply a partial metric space. In Example 3.2.4 we gave an

example of a partial metric space that is not T1.

Lemma 3.4.4. Every strong partial n − Metric space (X, T ) is T1.

Note that a strong partial n − Metric space need not be T2.

Example 3.4.5. (A strong partial n − Metric space that is not T2):

For n = 2, a strong partial n − Metric space is a strong partial metric space. In Example 3.2.5 we gave

an example of a strong partial metric space that is not T2.

Deﬁnition 3.4.6. Let (X, P ) be a partial n−Metric space. For each element x ∈ X and positive real number

ǫ, the P-gilded ball around x of radius ǫ is

˜BP

ǫ (x) = {y ∈ X | P (hxin−1, y) − P (hxin) ≤ ǫ}.

Example 3.4.7. (P-gilded but not closed ball):

For n = 2, a strong partial n − Metric space is a strong partial metric space. In Example 3.2.7 we gave

an example of an s-gilded ball that is not closed.

38

Chapter 4

Sequences and Limits

Deﬁnition 4.0.1. Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a topological space (X, T ). We say that a is a limit of

{xi}i∈N if and only if for every open neighborhood U of a, there exists a natural number N such that for all

i > N , xi ∈ U .

Chapter 4 deals with limits, Cauchy sequences and Cauchy pairs. As mentioned in Chapter 2, metrics

are a special case of partial metrics which in turn are a special case of partial n − Metrics. That is why, in

Section 4.1 we will be presenting the results without proofs. In Section 4.2, we supply the proofs because

they are considerably simpler than their counterparts in Section 4.3. Additionally for many users, we expect

the level of generality found in Section 4.2 to suﬃce.

4.1 Metric Space

The proofs for this section are readily available in [26].

Deﬁnition 4.1.1. Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a metric space (X, d). We say that the sequence {xi}i∈N

is Cauchy if and only if for each positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all

i ≥ j > N ,

d(xi, xj) < ǫ.

Merging Deﬁnition 4.0.1 and Deﬁnition 4.1.1, we can now identify a limit by analyzing distances.

Lemma 4.1.1. Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a metric space (X, d). A point a in X is a limit of {xi}i∈N if

and only if for each positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i ≥ j > N ,

d(a, xi) < ǫ.

Lemma 4.1.2. Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in a metric space (X, d). If {xi}i∈N has a limit in X then

that limit is unique.

Deﬁnition 4.1.2. Let (X, d) be a metric space. We say that (X, d) is complete if and only if every Cauchy

sequence in X has a limit in X.

39

Suppose we now have two diﬀerent sequences in a topological space. The study of their respective

terms and whether or not they get, in some sense, closer to each other proves to be quite useful in common

ﬁxed point theorems.

Deﬁnition 4.1.3. Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be sequences in a metric space (X, d). We say that {xi}i∈N and

{yi}i∈N form a Cauchy pair if and only if for each positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N

such that for all i, j > N ,

d(xi, yj) < ǫ.

Theorem 4.1.3. (Cauchy pair term comparison):

Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be two sequences in a metric space (X, d). The statements bellow are equivalent.

(a) {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N form a Cauchy pair.

(b) For every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i ≥ j > N ,

(c) For every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i ≥ j > N ,

d(xi, yj) < ǫ.

d(xj, yi) < ǫ.

When we introduce a Cauchy pair, not only are we considering a pair of sequences whose corresponding

terms get eventually arbitrarily close, but also the sequences are Cauchy.

Lemma 4.1.4. Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be a Cauchy pair in a metric space (X, d). Then {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N

are both Cauchy sequences. Additionally, if a is a limit of {xi}i∈N then a is also a limit of {yi}i∈N.

4.2 Partial Metric Space

Matthews[25] generalized the notion of a Cauchy sequence to partial metrics. Even though Matthews’

work was restricted to non-negative values in R, we will use his generalization of Cauchy sequences when

considering O’Neill’s deﬁnition[29] of partial metrics.

Deﬁnition 4.2.1. Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a partial metric space (X, p). We say that the sequence

{xi}i∈N is Cauchy if and only if there exists a real number r such that for each positive real number ǫ there

exists a natural number N where for all i ≥ j > N ,

We call r the central distance of {xi}i∈N.

−ǫ < p(xi, xj) − r < ǫ.

Notice that from Deﬁnition 4.2.1, p(xi, xi) tends to r. Hence, in the metric case the central distance r of

a Cauchy sequence is 0 and coincides with Deﬁnition 4.1.1.

From Deﬁnition 4.0.1 we get the lemma below.

40

Lemma 4.2.1. Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a partial metric space (X, p). A point a in X is a limit of

{xi}i∈N if and only if for each positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

p(a, xi) − p(a, a) < ǫ.

Proof: Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a partial metric space (X, p).

(⇒) Let a be a limit of {xi}i∈N. From Deﬁnition 3.2.2 we know that for each positive real number ǫ,

Bp

ǫ (a) is an open neighborhood of a. Since a is a limit of {xi}i∈N then there exists a natural number N such

that for all i > N ,

Therefore, from Deﬁnition 3.2.1

xi ∈ Bp

ǫ (a).

p(a, xi) − p(a, a) < ǫ.

(⇐) Assume that for each positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all

i ≥ j > N ,

By Deﬁnition 3.2.1

p(a, xi) − p(a, a) < ǫ.

xi ∈ Bp

ǫ (a).

Consider U an open neighborhood of a. From Deﬁnition 3.2.2 we know that there exists a positive real

number ǫ such that

Bp

ǫ (a) ⊆ U.

Therefore, there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

xi ∈ Bp

ǫ (a) ⊆ U.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2.2. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space. Consider a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with central

distance r. If the point a in X is a limit of {xi}i∈N, then

r ≤ p(a, a).

Proof: Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in X with central distance r. Then, from Deﬁnition 4.2.1, for

every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i ≥ j > N1,

therefore,

−

ǫ

< p(xi, xj ) − r <

r < p(xi, xj) +

Since a is a limit of {xi}i∈N, from Lemma 4.2.1, there exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

p(a, xi) − p(a, a) <

ǫ

41

therefore,

p(a, xi) < p(a, a) +

Now taking N = max{N1, N2} we get that for all i ≥ j > N

by (p-inq)

by (p-sym)

r < p(xi, xj) +

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ

and, therefore,

r < p(a, a) + ǫ

r ≤ p(a, a).

(cid:3)

In a metric space, a limit to a Cauchy sequence is unique. In a partial metric space though, that need

not be the case.

Example 4.2.2. (Multiple Limits):

Let p be a partial metric on X = R ∪ {a} where a /∈ R as deﬁned in Example 2.2.4 by:

For all x, y ∈ R,

p(a, a) = 0, p(a, x) = |x| and p(x, y) = |x − y| − 1.

Then the sequence { 1

2n }n∈N in X is Cauchy with a central distance r = −1. Moreover, 0 and a are both

limits of { 1

2n }n∈N.

Proof: Assuming that i ≥ j, then

Therefore,

p(

1
2i < p(

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that

1
2N < ǫ. Thus, for all

i ≥ j > N ,

−1 − ǫ < −1 −

1
2N < −1 −

1
2i < p(

1
2j ) <

1
2j − 1 <

1
2N − 1 < ǫ − 1.

42

From Deﬁnition 4.2.1, { 1

2n }n∈N is a Cauchy sequence with a central distance r = −1.

Additionally, for all natural numbers i,

and

p(0,

2i ) − p(0, 0) = |0 −

2i | − 1 − (−1) =

1
2i

p(a,

2i ) − p(a, a) = |

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

1
2N < ǫ.
(cid:3)

In the above example both 0 and a are limits of { 1

p( 1
2j ). Hence, in some sense, 0 has more signiﬁcance to the sequence { 1

2n }n∈N. However, p(a, a) = 0 6= lim

a does. We will call limits like this: special limits.

Deﬁnition 4.2.3. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space. Consider a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with a

central distance r. A point a in X is called a special limit of {xi}i∈N if and only if a is a limit of {xi}i∈N

and r = p(a, a).

In a partial metric space, the special limit is analogous to the limit in a metric space since, if it exists,

it is unique.

Lemma 4.2.3. Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in a partial metric space (X, p). If {xi}i∈N has a special

limit in X then that special limit is unique.

Proof: Consider the Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with a central distance r. If the points a and b of X

are both special limits of {xi}i∈N then, by Deﬁnition 4.2.3,

Furthermore, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i > N1,

p(a, a) = r = p(b, b).

i.e.

r −

< p(xi, xj) < r +

ǫ

−p(xi, xi) < −r +

.

By Deﬁnition 4.2.3, both a and b are limits of {xi}i∈N. Then, by Lemma 4.2.1, there exists a natural number

N2 such that for all i > N2,

p(a, xi) − r = p(a, xi) − p(a, a) <

ǫ
3

43

i.e.

and there exists a natural number N3 such that for all i > N3,

p(a, xi) < r +

ǫ
3

i.e.

p(b, xi) − r = p(b, xi) − p(b, b) <

ǫ
3

p(b, xi) < r +

ǫ

.

Hence, using (p-lbnd) we get for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2, N3}

such that for all i > N ,

by (p-inq)

by (p-sym)

Therefore,

i.e.

p(a, a) ≤ p(a, b)

≤ p(a, xi) + p(xi, b) − p(xi, xi)

= p(a, xi) + p(b, xi) − p(xi, xi)

p(a, a) = p(a, b).

Similarly p(b, b) = p(b, a) and, hence, by (p-sep) a = b.

(cid:3)

An additional property of a special limit is that it preserves a notion of sequential continuity.

Lemma 4.2.4. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space. Let a be the special limit of the Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N

in X with a central distance r. For every y in X and positive real number ǫ, there exists a natural number

N such that for all i > N ,

I.e.

−ǫ < p(y, xi) − p(y, a) < ǫ.

lim

i→+∞

p(y, xi) = p(y, a).

Proof: Let a be the special limit of the Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with a central distance r. From

Deﬁnition 4.2.3 we have

p(a, a) = r.

44

For every y in X and positive real number ǫ, there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i > N1,

i.e.

p(a, xi) − r = p(a, xi) − p(a, a) <

ǫ
2

p(a, xi) < r +

additionally, there exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

In particular for i = j,

r −

Hence, using (p-inq) we get that for every positive real number ǫ, there exists a natural number N =

max{N1, N2}, such that for all i > N ,

Additionally, by (p-inq)

by (p-sym)

Therefore,

p(y, xi) − p(y, a) ≤ p(y, a) + p(a, xi) − p(a, a) − p(y, a)

= p(a, xi) − p(a, a) <

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.2.4. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space. We say that (X, p) is complete if and only if every

Cauchy sequence has a special limit in X.

We conclude this section by extending the deﬁnition of a Cauchy pair to the partial metric case.

Deﬁnition 4.2.5. Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be two sequences in a partial metric space (X, p). We say that

{xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N form a Cauchy pair if and only if there exists a real number r such that for every

positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N where for all i, j > N ,

r − ǫ < min{p(xi, xi), p(yj, yj)} ≤ p(xi, yj) < r + ǫ.

We call r the central distance of the Cauchy pair {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N.

Theorem 4.2.5. (Cauchy pair term comparison):

Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be two sequences in a partial metric space (X, p). The statements below are equivalent.

(a) {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N form a Cauchy pair with central distance r.

(b) There exists a real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such

that for all i ≥ j > N ,

r − ǫ < min{p(xi, xi), p(yj, yj)} ≤ p(xi, yj) < r + ǫ.

(c) There exists a real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such

that for all i ≥ j > N ,

r − ǫ < min{p(xj, xj ), p(yi, yi)} ≤ p(xj, yi) < r + ǫ.

Proof: It is clear that (a) is true if and only if (b) and (c) are true.

Similarly we can prove that (c)⇒ (b).

Lemma 4.2.6. Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be a Cauchy pair with a central distance r in a partial metric space

(X, p). Then {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences with central distance r. If a is a (special) limit

of {xi}i∈N then a is also a (special) limit of {yi}i∈N.

46

Proof: Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be a Cauchy pair in X with a central distance r. Then for every positive

4.3 Partial n − Metric Space

In [2], and to retain the feel of Deﬁnition 4.2.1, we generalized a Cauchy sequence to the partial n−Metric

space in the manner below.

Deﬁnition 4.3.1. Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ). We say that the sequence

{xi}i∈N is Cauchy if and only if there exists a real number r where for each positive number ǫ there exists

a natural number N such that for all i1, i2, ..., in > N ,

We call r the central distance of {xi}i∈N.

−ǫ < P (hxit in

t=1) − r < ǫ.

Although the above deﬁnition is a natural generalization from the partial metric case, it may seem to the

reader that it is a condition that is diﬃcult to check in practice. Theorem 4.3.1 makes it much simpler to

check if a sequence in a partial n − Metric space is Cauchy.

Theorem 4.3.1. (Cauchy Sequence Two Term Comparison):

Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ). Then the statements bellow are equivalent.

(a) {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with a central distance r.

(b) There exists a positive real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number

N such that for all i, j > N ,

−ǫ < P (hxiin−1, xj) − r < ǫ.

(c) There exists a positive real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number

N such that for all i ≥ j > N ,

−ǫ < P (hxiin−1, xj) − r < ǫ.

(d) There exists a positive real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number

N such that for all i ≥ j > N ,

−ǫ < P (hxj in−1, xi) − r < ǫ.

Proof: (a)⇒ (b) and (b)⇒ (c) are trivial.

(c) ⇒ (d): For every positive real number ǫ, let ǫ′ = ǫ

2n−3 ≤ ǫ. Then, there exists a natural number N such

that for all i ≥ j > N ,

−ǫ′ < P (hxiin−1, xj) − r < ǫ′.

48

In particular, for i = j

and

By (Pn-lbnd) for all i ≥ j > N ,

−ǫ′ < P (hxj in) − r

−P (hxiin) < −r + ǫ′.

by Corollary 2.5.4,

−ǫ ≤ −ǫ′ < P (hxj in) − r ≤ P (hxj in−1, xi) − r

≤ (n − 1)P (hxiin−1, xj) − (n − 2)P (hxiin) − r

< (n − 1)(r + ǫ′) + (n − 2)(−r + ǫ′) − r

= (2n − 3)ǫ′ = ǫ.

Hence,

−ǫ < P (hxj in−1, xi) − r < ǫ.

(d)⇒ (a): For every positive real number ǫ, let ǫ′ = ǫ

2n−3 ≤ ǫ. Then, there exists a natural number N such

that for all i ≥ j > N ,

−ǫ′ < P (hxj in−1, xi) − r < ǫ′.

For all i1, i2, ..., in > N , we will prove that

−ǫ < P (hxit in

t=1) − r < ǫ′.

Without loss of generality by (Pn-sym), assume that in ≥ in−1 ≥ ..... ≥ i2 ≥ i1 > N . Hence, from (d), for

all t ≥ k in {1, ..., n} we get

Therefore

Lemma 4.3.2. Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ). A point a in X is a limit

of {xi}i∈N if and only if for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all

i > N ,

P (hain−1, xi) − P (hain) < ǫ.

50

Proof: Let {xi}i∈N be a sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ).

(⇒) Let a be a limit of {xi}i∈N then for every positive real number ǫ, BP

ǫ (a) is an open neighborhood of

a. Hence, there exists a positive natural number N such that for all i > N ,

Therefore, from Deﬁnition 3.3.1

xi ∈ BP

ǫ (a).

P (hain−1, xi) − P (hain) < ǫ.

(⇐) Assume that for each positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

P (hain−1, xi) − P (hain) < ǫ

xi ∈ BP

ǫ (a).

For every open neighborhood U of a, from Deﬁnition 3.3.2 we know that their exists a positive real number

ǫ such that

ǫ (a) ⊆ U.

Therefore, there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

xi ∈ BP

ǫ (a) ⊆ U.

The next theorem shows that partial n − Metrics possess a kind of upper semi-continuity property.

Theorem 4.3.3. (Upper Semi Continuity):

Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ) with limit a in X. Then for every
0 ≤ q ≤ n − 1 , {bk}q

P (hxit in−q

there exists a natural number N such that for all i1, i2, ..., in−q > N ,

P (hain−1, xit ) − P (hain) < ǫ′.

Hence, without loss of generality by (Pn-sym) we may assume that in−q ≥ in−q−1 ≥ ... ≥ i2 ≥ i1 > N . Then

Corollary 4.3.4. Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ) with a limit a in

X. Then for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i1, i2, ..., in > N

and all 0 ≤ q ≤ n the statements below hold true.
(a) P (hxit in−q
(b) P (hxit in
(c) P (hxit in−1

t=1 , haiq) < P (hain) + ǫ.
t=1) < P (hain) + ǫ.
t=1 , a) < P (hain) + ǫ.

The above Corollary is trivial to prove using Theorem 4.3.3 while varying 1 ≤ q ≤ n − 1 and taking

for all k, bk = a. The case where q = n is trivial since

P (hain) < P (hain) + ǫ

for any positive real number ǫ.

As in Example 4.2.2, a limit of a Cauchy sequence need not be unique.

Deﬁnition 4.3.2. Let (X, p) be a partial n − Metric space. Consider a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with

a central distance r. A point a in X is called a special limit of {xi}i∈N if and only if a is a limit of {xi}i∈N

and r = P (hain).

As in the case of a partial metric space a special limit is unique.

Theorem 4.3.5. (Uniqueness of Special Limits):

Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ). If {xi}i∈N has a special limit in X

then that special limit is unique.

Proof: Consider the Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with a central distance r. If a and b are both special

limits of {xi}i∈N , then by Deﬁnition 4.3.2

P (hain) = r = P (hbin).

Furthermore, from Deﬁnition 4.3.1, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N1 such

that for all i > N1,

i.e.

−

< P (hxiin) − r,

−P (hxiin) < −r +

.

The special limit a of {xi}i∈N is also a limit of {xi}i∈N. Hence, by Corollary 4.3.4 for every positive real

number ǫ there exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

i.e.

P (hain−1, xi) − P (hain) <

ǫ
3

P (hain−1, xi) < r +

ǫ

.

52

The special limit b of {xi}i∈N is also a limit of {xi}i∈N. Hence, by Corollary 4.3.7 there exists a natural

number N3 such that for all i > N3,

i.e.

P (hxiin−1, b) < P (hbin) +

ǫ
3

,

P (hxiin−1, b) < r +

ǫ
3

.

Hence, using (Pn-lbnd) we get that for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number

N = max{N1, N2, N3} such that for all i > N ,

by (Pn-inq)

therefore,

P (hain) ≤ P (hain−1, b)

P (hain) = P (hain−1, b).

Similarly P (hbin) = P (hbin−1, a) and, hence, by (Pn-sep)

a = b.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.3.6. (Continuity of Special Limits):

Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ) with special limit a in X. Then for
every 0 ≤ q ≤ n − 1 , {bk}q

k=1 ⊆ X and positive real number ǫ, there exists a natural number N such that for

all i1, i2, ..., in−q > N ,

P (hain−q, hbkiq

k=1) − ǫ < P (hxit in−q

t=1 , hbkiq

k=1) < P (hain−q, hbkiq

k=1) + ǫ.

Proof: Let r be the central distance of {xi}i∈N. By Deﬁnition 4.3.2

P (hain) = r.

Let 0 ≤ q ≤ n − 1 , {bk}q

k=1 ⊆ X, and positive real number ǫ. Let ǫ′ = ǫ

2(n−q) . By Deﬁnition 4.3.2, a is also

a limit of {xi}i∈N and, hence, there exists a natural number N1 such that for all it > N1,

i.e.

P (hxit in−1, a) < P (hain) + ǫ′,

P (hxit in−1, a) < r + ǫ′.

53

By Deﬁnition 4.3.1, there exists a natural number N2 such that for all it > N2,

i.e.

−ǫ′ < P (hxit in) − r,

−P (hxit in) < −r + ǫ′.

Hence, using Theorem 2.5.1 there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2} such that for all

i1, i2, ..., in−q > N ,

The right side of the inequality was already proved in Theorem 4.3.3.

Corollary 4.3.7. Let {xi}i∈N be a Cauchy sequence in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ) with special limit a

in X. Then for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i1, i2, ..., in > N

and 0 ≤ q ≤ n the statements below hold true.

The above Corollary is trivial to prove using Theorem 4.3.6 while varying 1 ≤ q ≤ n − 1 and taking for

all k, bk = a. The case where q = n is trivial.

Deﬁnition 4.3.3. Let (X, P ) be a partial n − Metric space. We say that (X, P ) is complete if and only if

every Cauchy sequence has a special limit in X.

Deﬁnition 4.3.4. Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be two sequences in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ). We say

that {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N form a Cauchy pair if and only if there exists a real number r such that for every

positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i, j > N ,

r − ǫ < min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)} ≤ P (hxiin−1, yj) < r + ǫ.

We call r the central distance of the Cauchy pair {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N.

54

Theorem 4.3.8. (Cauchy pair term comparison):

Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be two sequences in a partial n − Metric space (X, P ). The statements bellow are

equivalent.

(a) {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N form a Cauchy pair with central distance r.

(b) There exists a real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such

that for all i, j > N ,

r − ǫ < min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)} ≤ P (hyjin−1, xi) < r + ǫ.

(c) There exists a real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such

that for all i ≥ j > N ,

r − ǫ < min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)} ≤ P (hxiin−1, yj) < r + ǫ.

(d) There exists a real number r where for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such

that for all i ≥ j > N ,

r − ǫ < min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)} ≤ P (hxj in−1, yi) < r + ǫ.

Proof: It is clear that (a) is true if and only if (c) and (d) are true. Hence, it will be enough to prove

that (a) is equivalent to (b) and (c) is equivalent to (d).

(a)⇒(b): Assume that {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N form a Cauchy pair with central distance r. For every positive

real number ǫ, let ǫ′ = ǫ

2n−3 ≤ ǫ. Hence, there exists a natural number N such that for all i, j > N ,

r − ǫ′ < min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)} ≤ P (hxiin−1, yj) < r + ǫ′

in particular,

Therefore,

from (Pn-lbnd)

by Corollary 2.5.4

−P (hxiin) < −r + ǫ′.

r − ǫ ≤ r − ǫ′ ≤ min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)}

≤ P (hyiin) ≤ P (hyjin−1, xi)

≤ (n − 1)P (hxiin−1, yj) − (n − 2)P (hxiin)

< (n − 1)(r + ǫ′) + (n − 2)(−r + ǫ′) = r + (2n − 3)ǫ′ = r + ǫ.

The proof that (b)⇒ (b) is similar.

(c)⇒ (d): For every positive real number ǫ, let ǫ′ = ǫ

2n+1 ≤ ǫ. Hence, there exists a natural number N

such that for all i ≥ j > N ,

r − ǫ′ < min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)} ≤ P (hxiin−1, yj) < r + ǫ′

55

in particular,

Therefore,

from (Pn-lbnd)

−P (hxiin) < −r + ǫ′ , − P (hyjin) < −r + ǫ′,

P (hxiin−1, yi) < r + ǫ′ and P (hxj in−1, yj) < r + ǫ′.

r − ǫ ≤ r − ǫ′ ≤ min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)}

≤ P (hxj in) ≤ P (hxj in−1, yi)

by using (Pn-inq) twice we get

≤ P (hxj in−1, yj) + P (hyj in−1, yi) − P (hyjin)

≤ P (hxjin−1, yj) + P (hyjin−1, xi) + P (hxiin−1, yi) − P (hxiin) − P (hyjin)

by Corollary 2.5.4

≤ P (hxj in−1, yj) + (n − 1)P (hxiin−1, yj) − (n − 2)P (hxiin) + P (hxiin−1, yi) − P (hxiin) − P (hyj in)

< (r + ǫ′) + (n − 1)(r + ǫ′) + (n − 2)(−r + ǫ′) + (r + ǫ′) + (−r + ǫ′) + (−r + ǫ′)

Similarly we can prove that (d)⇒(c).

(cid:3)

= r + (2n + 1)ǫ′ = r + ǫ.

Lemma 4.3.9. Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be a Cauchy pair with a central distance r in a partial n − Metric

space (X, P ). Then {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences with central distance r. If a is a (special)

limit of {xi}i∈N then a is a (special) limit of {yi}i∈N.

Proof: Let {xi}i∈N and {yi}i∈N be a Cauchy pair in X with a central distance r. Then for every positive

real number ǫ there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i, j > N1,

and

Hence, by Theorem 4.3.1, {yi}i∈N (and similarly {xi}i∈N ) is a Cauchy sequence with central distance r.

Now assume that a is a limit of {xi}i∈N. By Lemma 4.3.2, for every positive real number ǫ, there exists

a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

P (hain−1, xi) − P (hain) <

Therefore, for every positive number ǫ, there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2} such that for all

Cauchy Functions

It all started in 1922 with Stephan Banach[5]. Given a metric space (X, d) and a function f : X → X,

Banach gave contracting criteria on f allowing him to generate from that function a Cauchy sequence. He

then proved that the limit of this sequence is a ﬁxed point. His ﬁxed point theorem was generalized in many

ways, but all generalizations had the same ﬂow.

Step 1: Give criteria for the function to generate a Cauchy sequence.

Step 2: Make sure the limit of that Cauchy sequence exists.

Step 3: Give criteria on that function that leads to sequential continuity on the limit of the Cauchy sequence.

This ensures the existence of a ﬁxed point is found.

The most notable generalization was given in 1962 by Morris Michael Edelstein[10], who restricted

the contractiveness to an orbit. In 1977 by Yakov I. Alber and Sylvie Guerre-Delabriere[1] generalized a

contraction to a weak ϕ-contraction.

In Chapter 5 we will investigate some contractive criteria on a function that enables it to generate a

Cauchy sequence in its domain.

Deﬁnition 5.0.1. Let (X, T ) be a topological space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X.

Denote f 0(xo) = x0, f 1(xo) = f (xo) and inductively f n+1(xo) = f (f n(xo)). The orbit of f at xo is the

sequence {f i(xo)}i∈N.

5.1 Metric Space

Deﬁnition 5.1.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. We say

that f is a Cauchy function at xo if and only if {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. We say that f is a

Cauchy function if and only if for every x in X, {f i(x)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence.

Deﬁnition 5.1.2. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. We say

that f is an orbital contraction at xo (or f is orbitally contractive at xo ) if and only if there exists a

real number 0 < c < 1 such that for all natural numbers i,

d(f i+1(xo), f i(x0) ≤ cd(f i(xo), f i−1(xo)).

58

We say that f is an orbital contraction (or f is orbitally contractive) if and only if for every x in X

f is an orbital contraction at x.

Lemma 5.1.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. If f is an

orbital contraction at xo then f is a Cauchy function at xo.

Deﬁnition 5.1.3. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. We say

that f is an orbital ϕ−contraction at xo (or f is orbitally ϕ−contractive at xo) if and only if there

exists a non-decreasing function ϕ : [0, +∞) ⊂ R → [0, +∞) such that

and for all i and j,

ϕ(t) = 0 if and only if t = 0

d(f i+1(xo), f j+1(xo)) ≤ d(f i(xo), f j(xo)) − ϕ(d(f i(xo), f j(xo)).

We say that f is an orbital ϕ-contraction (or f is orbitally ϕ−contractive) if and only if for every x

in X, f is an orbital ϕ−contraction at x.

Lemma 5.1.2. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. If f is an

orbital ϕ−contraction at xo then f is a Cauchy function at xo.

While searching the literature for common ﬁxed point theorems, those we found required the two functions

to commute and the space was required to have certain conditions in addition to being complete[14]. We

wanted to present a common ﬁxed point theorem that relies on a contraction criteria and can be easily

generalized to a coincidence point theorem.

Remark 5.1.4. If the reader is unfamiliar with the terms common ﬁxed point and coincidence point,

the deﬁnitions will be presented in Chapter 7 where they are needed to state our main theorems.

Deﬁnition 5.1.5. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be two

functions on X. We say that f and g are pairwise f −contractive over (xo, yo) if and only if there exists

a real number 0 < c < 1 such that for all natural numbers i,

d(f i+1(x0), gi(yo)) ≤ cd(f i(xo), gi−1(yo))

d(f i(x0), gi(yo)) ≤ cd(f i−1(xo), gi−1(yo))




In fact Deﬁnition 5.1.5 is more general and much easier to check than: For all i and j,

d(f i+1(x0), gj+1(yo)) ≤ cd(f i(xo), gj(yo)).

Deﬁnition 5.1.6. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be

two functions on X. we say that f and g are Cauchy pairs over (xo, yo) if and only if {f i(xo)}i∈N and

{gi(yo)}i∈N form a Cauchy pair.

59

Theorem 5.1.3. (Cauchy Pairwise f −contractive):

Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be two functions on X. If

f and g are pairwise f −contractive over (xo, yo) then f and g are Cauchy pairs over (xo, yo).

Deﬁnition 5.1.7. Let (X, l) and (Y, d) be two metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y two functions

on X. We say that f and g are mutually contractive if and only if there exist two real numbers 0 < c < 1

and A ≥ 0 where for each x in X we can ﬁnd a n element z in X such that

and

d(f (z), g(z)) ≤ cd(f (x), g(x))

l(x, z) ≤ Ad(f (x), g(x)).

Theorem 5.1.4 is a special case of Theorem 5.2.4. We have chosen to include the proof because, as far as

we have been able to determine, the result is new and the proof increases in complexity in the partial metric

case.

Theorem 5.1.4. (Cauchy Mutually Contractive):

Let (X, l) and (Y, d) be two metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y be two functions on X. If f

and g are mutually contractive then there exists a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X such that {f (xi)}n∈N and

{g(xi)}n∈N form a Cauchy pair in Y .

Proof: Since f and g are mutually contractive then there exit two real numbers 0 < c < 1 and A ≥ 0

such that for each x in X, there exists a z in X such that

and

d(f (z), g(z)) ≤ cd(f (x), g(x))

l(x, z) ≤ Ad(f (x), g(x)).

Let us take an arbitrary element x1 in X then there exists an element x2 in X such that

d(f (x2), g(x2)) ≤ cd(f (x1), g(x1)) and l(x1, x2) ≤ Ad(f (x1), g(x1)).

There exists an element x3 in X such that

d(f (x3), g(x3)) ≤ cd(f (x2), g(x2)) and l(x2, x3) ≤ Ad(f (x2), g(x2)).

We continue the above process to generate the sequence {xi}i∈N such that for all i,

d(f (xi+1), g(xi+1)) ≤ cd(f (xi), g(xi)) and l(xi, xi+1) ≤ Ad(f (xi), g(xi)).

(¨⋄)

We now prove that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with two steps.

Step 1: For all i let ti = d(f (xi), g(xi)). Then from (¨⋄)

ti+1 = d(f (xi+1), g(xi+1)) ≤ cd(f (xi), g(xi)) ≤ c2d(f (xi−1), g(xi−1))

60

and, hence, by induction

ti+1 ≤ cid(f (x1), g(x1)) = cit1.

(ˇ⋄)

Since 0 < c < 1 then for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N ′ such that cN ′−1t1 < ǫ

and, hence, for all i > N ′,

d(f (xi), g(xi)) = ti ≤ ci−1t1 < cN ′−1t1 < ǫ.

Step 2: For all j > i and by repeatedly using (d-inq) we get,

l(xi, xj) ≤ l(xi, xi+1) + l(xi+1, xi+2) + .......l(xj−1, xj)

from Deﬁnition 5.1.7

≤ Ad(f (xi), g(xi)) + Ad(f (xi+1), g(xi+1)) + ..... + Ad(f (xj−1), g(xj−1))

(cid:3)

The corollary below is straight forward by taking Y = X.

Corollary 5.1.5. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be two functions on X. If f

and g are mutually contractive then there exists a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X such that {f (xi)}n∈N and

{g(xi)}n∈N form a Cauchy pair.

5.2 Partial Metric Space

We now generalize the notion of a Cauchy function into a partial metric space. Inspiration came from

the work of S. Matthews[7] and E. Karapinar[21, 22]. Although their theorems were quite elegant, we felt

that by requiring their Cauchy sequences to have a central distance r = 0, the partial metric spaces were not

used to their full potential. In [3], we give contracting criteria on a function f so that the central distance of

Cauchy sequence generated is not restricted to be 0.

61

Deﬁnition 5.2.1. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X.

We say that f is a Cauchy function at xo if and only if {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. We say that f

is a Cauchy function if and only if for every x in X, {f i(x)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence.

Deﬁnition 5.2.2. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. For

every real number r , we say that f is an orbital r−contraction at xo (or f is orbitally r−contractive at xo)

if and only if there exists a real number 0 < c < 1 such that for all i,

r ≤ p(f i(xo), f i(x0))

and

p(f i+2(xo), f i+1(x0)) ≤ r + ci+1|p(f (xo), xo)|.

We say that f is an orbital r-contraction (or f is orbitally r−contractive) if and only if for every x in

X, f is a orbital r−contraction at x.

Lemma 5.2.1. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. If f

is an orbital r−contraction at xo then f is a Cauchy function at xo.

Proof: For every xo in X, let f : X → X be an orbital r−contraction at xo. Denote xi = f i(xo). We

now move to prove that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. Let M = |p(x1, xo)| = |p(f (xo), xo)|. Then from

Deﬁnition 5.2.2 and by (p-lbnd) we get for all i,

r ≤ p(xi, xi) ≤ p(xi+1, xi) ≤ r + ciM

(△)

and, hence,

For all j ≥ i, and by using (p-inq)

−p(xi, xi) < −r.

by (△)

by (p-inq)

by (△)

p(xj, xi) ≤ p(xj , xi+1) + p(xi+1, xi) − p(xi+1, xi+1)

As we mentioned before, Karapinar[22] generalized a ϕ−contraction on a metric space to a to ϕ−contraction

on a partial metric space. His proposed generalization contracted over the whole space and the central dis-

tance of the obtained Cauchy sequence was forced to be zero. In [3], we relax the constraints on the function

f requiring it only to be contracting on orbits. We also allow the central distance of the obtained Cauchy

sequence to be any arbitrary real number r.

Deﬁnition 5.2.3. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. For

every real number r, we say that f is an orbital ϕr−Contraction at xo (or f is orbitally ϕr−contractive

at xo) if and only if there exists a non-decreasing function ϕ : [r, +∞) ⊂ R → [0, +∞) such that

ϕ(t) = 0 if and only if t = r

r ≤ p(f i(xo), f i(xo))

and

p(f i+1(xo), f j+1(xo)) ≤ p(f i(xo), f j(xo)) − ϕ(p(f i(xo), f j(xo)).

We say that f is an orbital ϕr−contraction (or f is orbitally ϕr−contractive ) if and only if for every

x in X, f is an orbital ϕr-contraction at x.

63

Lemma 5.2.2. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. If f

is an orbital ϕr-contraction at xo then f is a Cauchy function at xo.

Proof: For every xo in X, let f : X → X be an orbital ϕr−contraction at xo. Denote xi = f i(xo).

Step 1: Let ti = p(xi+1, xi). In this step we will show that in the topological space R endowed with the

standard topology, {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence that converges to r.

From (p-lbnd) and since ϕ(ti) ≥ 0,

r ≤ p(xi+1, xi+1) ≤ p(xi+2, xi+1) = ti+1

and

Hence, for all i,

ti+1 = p(xi+2, xi+1) ≤ p(xi+1, xi) − ϕ(p(xi+1, xi))

= ti − ϕ(ti) ≤ ti.

r ≤ ti+1 ≤ ti

i.e. {ti}i∈N is a non-increasing sequence in R bounded below by r and, therefore, {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence

in R. Since R with the standard topology is a complete metric space, {ti}i∈N has a limit L such that for all

i,

and, since ϕ is a non-decreasing function,

i.e.

Hence, by Deﬁnition 5.2.3

by induction

ti ≥ L ≥ r

ϕ(ti) ≥ ϕ(L) ≥ ϕ(r) = 0

−ϕ(ti) ≤ −ϕ(L) ≤ 0.

r ≤ ti+1 ≤ ti − ϕ(ti) ≤ ti − ϕ(L)

≤ ti−1 − ϕ(ti−1) − ϕ(L) ≤ ti−1 − 2ϕ(L)

ti+1 ≤ t1 − iϕ(L).

Assume that L > r then by Deﬁnition 5.2.3 ϕ(L) > 0. By taking i > t1−r

ϕ(L) we get

ti+1 ≤ t1 − iϕ(L) < t1 −

t1 − r
ϕ(L)

ϕ(L) = r

a contradiction since ti ≥ r. Therefore, L = r.

Step 2: We now show that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with central distance r by supposing that it is

not (a contrapositive approach). From Deﬁnition 5.2.3 we know that for all i and j,

r ≤ p(xi, xi) ≤ p(xi, xj)

64

in particular, for i = j,

−p(xi, xi) ≤ −r.

Hence, if {xi}i∈N is not a Cauchy sequence with central distance r then there exists a positive real number

δ such that for every natural number N , there exists i, j > N where

p(xi, xj ) ≥ r + δ > r.

Choose N1 = 1 then there exists j1 > i1 > N1 such that

let m1 = i1 and n1 be the smallest number n1 > m1 such that

p(xi1 , xj1 ) ≥ r + δ > r,

in other words

p(xm1 , xn1 ) ≥ r + δ

p(xm1 , xn1−1) < r + δ.

Now take N2 > max{m1, n1} then there exists j2 > i2 > N2 such that

let m2 = i2 and n2 be the smallest number n2 > m2 such that

p(xi2 , xj2 ) ≥ r + δ > r,

in other words

p(xm2 , xn2 ) ≥ r + δ

p(xm2 , xn2−1) < r + δ.

Continuing this process, we build two increasing sequences in N, {mk}k∈N and {nk}k∈N such that for all k,

p(xmk , xnk−1) < r + δ ≤ p(xmk , xnk ).

For all k, denote sk = p(xmk , xnk ). By (p-inq)

sk = p(xmk , xnk ) ≤ p(xmk , xnk −1) + p(xnk −1, xnk ) − p(xnk −1, xnk −1)

by (p-sym) and Step 1

and, hence,

= p(xmk , xnk−1) + p(xnk , xnk −1) − p(xnk −1, xnk−1)

≤ p(xmk , xnk −1) + tnk−1 − r

sk ≤ p(xmk , xnk −1) + tnk−1 − r.

(△′)

65

Additionally, since {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence tending to r, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a

natural number N such that for all nk − 1 > N ,

r ≤ tnk−1 < r + ǫ.

Since {mk}k∈N and {nk}k∈N are increasing sequences, there exists a natural number N ′ such that for all

k > N ′, nk − 1 > N . Therefore for all k > N ′ and since r + δ ≤ sk,

from (△′)

0 ≤ sk − (r + δ)

≤ p(xmk , xnk −1) + tnk−1 − r − (r + δ)

< (r + δ) + (r + ǫ) − r − (r + δ) = ǫ.

Therefore, {sk}k∈N is a Cauchy sequence with r + δ as a limit. On the other hand by applying (p-inq) twice

we get

sk = p(xmk , xnk ) ≤ p(xmk , xnk+1) + p(xnk+1, xnk ) − p(xnk+1, xnk+1)

≤ p(xmk , xmk+1) + p(xmk+1, xnk+1) − p(xmk+1, xmk+1) + p(xnk+1, xnk ) − p(xnk+1, xnk+1)

from (p-sym) and Step 1

= p(xmk+1, xmk ) + p(xmk+1, xnk+1) − p(xmk+1, xmk+1) + p(xnk+1, xnk ) − p(xnk+1, xnk+1)

= tmk + p(xmk+1, xnk+1) − p(xmk+1, xmk+1) + tnk − p(xnk+1, xnk+1)

≤ tmk + p(xmk+1, xnk+1) − r + tnk − r

from Deﬁnition 5.2.3

and, hence,

i.e.

≤ tmk + p(xmk , xnk ) − ϕ(p(xmk , xnk )) − r + tnk − r

sk ≤ tmk + sk − ϕ(sk) + tnk − 2r

ϕ(sk) ≤ tmk + tnk − 2r.

Since r < r + δ ≤ sk and from Deﬁnition 5.2.3 we get

0 < ϕ(r + δ) ≤ ϕ(sk) ≤ tmk + tnk − 2r.

Since {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence that tends to r then for every positive real number ǫ, there exists a natural

number N such that for all mk, nk > N ,

0 < ϕ(r + δ) ≤ tmk + tnk − 2r < (r +

ǫ
2

) + (r +

ǫ
2

) − 2r = ǫ

66

and, hence,

0 < ϕ(r + δ) ≤ 0

a clear contradiction. Therefore, the assumption considered at the beginning of Step 2 is incorrect proving

that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with central distance r.

(cid:3)

We now move to generalizing pairwise contractive functions.

Deﬁnition 5.2.4. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be

two functions on X. For every real number r, we say that f and g are pairwise fr−contractive over (xo, yo)

if and only if there exists a real number 0 < c < 1 such that for all natural numbers i,

r ≤ min{p(f i(xo), f i(xo)), p(gi(yo), gi(yo))}

p(f i+1(x0), gi(yo)) ≤ r + ciM

Deﬁnition 5.2.5. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X

be two functions on X. We say that f and g are Cauchy pairs over (xo, yo) if and only if {f i(xo)}i∈N and

{gi(yo)}i∈N form a Cauchy pair.

Theorem 5.2.3. (Cauchy Pairwise fr−Contractive):

Let (X, p) be a partial metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be two functions

on X. If f and g are pairwise fr−contractive over (xo, yo) then f and g are Cauchy pairs over (xo, yo).

Proof: For all i, let xi = f i(xo) and yi = gi(yo). Let M = max{|p(f (xo), yo)|, |p(xo, yo)|}.

Step 1: From Deﬁnition 5.2.1 we know that

In particular, for all i,

Theorem 4.2.5 allows us to investigate p(xi, yj) for i ≥ j. Let us ﬁrst investigate what happens for speciﬁc

values of i and j. By repeatedly using (p-inq) we get

p(x6, y3) ≤ p(x6, y5) − p(y5, y5) + p(y5, x5) − p(x5, x5) + p(x5, y4) − p(y4, y4) + p(y4, x4) − p(x4, x4) + p(x4, y3)

by (p-sym)

= p(x6, y5) − p(y5, y5) + p(x5, y5) − p(x5, x5) + p(x5, y4) − p(y4, y4) + p(x4, y4) − p(x4, x4) + p(x4, y3)

We now move to derive an upper bound for p(xi, yj) where i ≥ j.

Deﬁnition 5.2.6. Let (X, p) and (Y, h) be two partial metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y be two

functions on X. For every real number r we say that f and g are mutually fr−contractive if and only if

there exists two real numbers 0 < c < 1 and A ≥ 0 where for each x in X we can ﬁnd an element z of X

such that

and

h(f (z), g(z)) − h(f (z), f (z)) ≤ c[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(f (x), f (x))]

r ≤ p(z, z) ≤ p(x, z) ≤ r + A[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(f (x), f (x))].

Putting a heavier emphasis on one function makes it much easier to apply the theorem below on a pair

of functions having one much more complex than the other. The above contraction is enough to generate a

Cauchy sequence in X as shown in Theorem 5.2.4. In the case of (Y, h) being a strong partial metric space,

mutually fr−contraction is used to obtain a coincidence point. However, when (Y, h) is a partial metric case,

we need a stronger version.

Deﬁnition 5.2.7. Let (X, p) and (Y, h) be two partial metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y be two

functions on X. For every real number r we say that f and g are mutually (f, g)r−contractive if and only

if there exists two real numbers 0 < c < 1 and A ≥ 0 where for each x in X we can ﬁnd an element z of X

such that

and

h(f (z), g(z)) − h(f (z), f (z)) ≤ c[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(f (x), f (x))]

h(f (z), g(z)) − h(g(z), g(z)) ≤ c[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(g(x), g(x))]

r ≤ p(z, z) ≤ p(x, z) ≤ r + A[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(f (x), f (x))]

r ≤ p(z, z) ≤ p(x, z) ≤ r + A[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(g(x), g(x))].

It is clear that if two functions f and g are mutually (f, g)r−contractive then they are mutually fr−contractive

and mutually gr−contractive.

Theorem 5.2.4. (Cauchy Mutually fr-Contractive):

Let (X, p) and (Y, h) be two partial metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y be two functions on X. If

f and g are mutually fr−contractive then there exists a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with central distance

r such that for all natural numbers i, r ≤ p(xi, xi). Additionally for every positive real number ǫ there exists

a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi)) < ǫ.

Proof: Since f and g are mutually fr−contractive then there exit two real numbers 0 < c < 1 and A ≥ 0

such that for each x in X, there exists a z in X such that

h(f (z), g(z)) − h(f (z), f (z)) ≤ c[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(f (x), f (x))]

69

and

r ≤ p(z, z) ≤ p(x, z) ≤ r + A[h(f (x), g(x)) − h(f (x), f (x))].

Let us take an arbitrary element x1 in X then there exists an element x2 in X such that

h(f (x2), g(x2)) − h(f (x2), f (x2)) ≤ c[h(f (x1), g(x1)) − h(f (x1), f (x1))]

and

r ≤ p(x2, x2) ≤ p(x1, x2) ≤ r + A[h(f (x1), g(x1)) − h(f (x1), f (x1))].

There exists an element x3 in X such that

h(f (x3), g(x3)) − h(f (x3), f (x3)) ≤ c[h(f (x2), g(x2)) − h(f (x2), f (x2))]

and

r ≤ p(x3, x3) ≤ p(x2, x3) ≤ r + A[h(f (x2), g(x2)) − h(f (x2), f (x2))].

We continue the above process to generate the sequence {xi}i∈N such that for all i,

h(f (xi+1), g(xi+1)) − h(f (xi+1), f (xi+1)) ≤ c[h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi))]

and

in particular,

i.e.

r ≤ p(xi+1, xi+1) ≤ p(xi, xi+1) ≤ r + A[h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi))]

( ¨△)

r ≤ p(xi, xi)

−p(xi, xi) ≤ r.

We now prove that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with central distance r.

Step 1: For all i, let ti = h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi)). Then from ( ¨△)

ti+1 = h(f (xi+1), g(xi+1)) − h(f (xi+1), f (xi+1))

≤ c[h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi))] ≤ c2[h(f (xi−1), g(xi−1)) − h(f (xi−1), f (xi−1))]

and, hence, by induction

ti+1 ≤ ci[h(f (x1), g(x1)) − h(f (x1), g(x1))] = cit1.

Therefore, and since 0 < c < 1 for every positive real number ǫ there exists natural number N ′ such that for

all i > N ′,

Step 2: For all j > i , by ( ¨△) and repeatedly using (p-inq) we get,

h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi)) < ǫ.

The corollary below is straight forward by taking Y = X.

Corollary 5.2.5. Let (X, p) be a partial metric space. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be two functions on

distance r such that for all natural numbers i, r ≤ p(xi, xi). Additionally for every positive real number ǫ

there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

p(f (xi), g(xi)) − p(f (xi), f (xi)) < ǫ.

5.3 Partial n − Metric Space

The inspiration for this section mainly came from Erdal Karapinar’s work[4]. As explained in Chapter 2,

we have relaxed the axioms of a Gp−metric to obtain the partial 3 − Metric. We also have a much less

restrictive condition on the contracting functions and the central distance of a Cauchy sequence. To this end,

we will use Theorem 4.3.1 to check wether a sequence is Cauchy or not by comparing the elements pairwise

rather than comparing n−tuples. We start with the deﬁnition of a Cauchy function in a partial n − Metric

space[2].

The main diﬀerence between the proofs of Section 5.2 and the proofs of Section 5.3 is adding steps and

considering a diﬀerent ǫ to compensate for the fact that:

For any two elements a and b in a set X. If p is a partial metric on X then by (p-inq)

p(a, b) = p(a, b).

71

On the other hand, if P is a partial n − Metric on X then by Corollary 2.5.4

P (hain−1, b) ≤ (n − 1)P (hbin−1, a) − (n − 2)P (hbin).

Otherwise, the proofs are very similar to the proofs in Section 5.2 and, hence, may be skipped if the reader

so desires.

Deﬁnition 5.3.1. Let (X, P ) be a partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on

X. We say that f is a Cauchy function at xo if and only if {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. We say

that f is a Cauchy function if and only if for every x in X, {f i(x)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence.

Deﬁnition 5.3.2. Let (X, P ) be a partial n−Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X.

For every real number r, we say that f is an orbital r−contraction at xo (or f is orbitally r−contractive at xo)

if and only if there exists a real number 0 < c < 1 such that for all i,

r ≤ P (hf i+1(xo)in)

and

P (hf i(xo)in−1, f i+1(x0)) ≤ r + ci|P (hxoin−1, f (xo))|.

We say that f is an orbital r−contraction (or f is orbitally r−contractive) if and only if for every x

in X, f is an orbital r−contraction at x.

Lemma 5.3.1. Let (X, P ) be a partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X.

If f is an orbital r−contraction at xo then f is a Cauchy function at xo.

Proof: For every xo in X, let f : X → X be an orbital r−contraction at xo. Denote xi = f i(xo). We

now move to prove that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. Let

M = |P (hxoin−1, x1)| = |P (hxoin−1, f (xo))|.

Then, from Deﬁnition 5.3.2 and by (Pn-lbnd) we get for all i,

r ≤ P (hxiin) ≤ P (hxiin−1, xi+1) ≤ r + ciM

(⊗)

and, hence,

For all j ≥ i, and by using (Pn-inq)

−P (hxiin) ≤ −r.

P (hxiin−1, xj) ≤ P (hxiin−1, xi+1) + P (hxi+1in−1, xj) − P (hxi+1in)

Therefore, by Theorem 4.3.1, {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with central distance r.

Bilgili[6] generalized the idea of a weak contraction into a Gp−metric space. We build on his work and

generalize it to a partial n − Metric case.

Deﬁnition 5.3.3. Let (X, P ) be a partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function

on X. For every real number r, we say that f is an orbital ϕr−contraction at xo (or f is orbitally

ϕr−contractive at xo) if and only if there exists a non-decreasing function ϕ : [r, +∞) ⊂ R → [0, +∞)

such that for all i and j,

and

P (hf i+1(xo)in−1, f j+1(xo)) ≤ P (hf i(xo)in−1, f j(xo)) − ϕ(P (hf i(xo)in−1, f j(xo)))

We say that f is an orbital ϕr−contraction (or f is orbitally ϕr−contractive) if and only if for every

x in X, f is an orbital ϕr-contraction at x.

73

Lemma 5.3.2. Let (X, P ) be a partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X.

If f is an orbital ϕr-contraction at xo then f is a Cauchy function at xo.

Proof: For every xo in X, let f : X → X be an orbital ϕr−contraction at xo. Denote xi = f i(xo).

Step 1: Let ti = P (hxiin−1, xi+1). In this step we will show that in the topological space R endowed with

the standard topology, {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence that converges to r.

From (Pn-lbnd) and Deﬁnition 5.3.3,

r ≤ P (hxi+1in) ≤ P (hxi+1in−1, xi+2) = ti+1

≤ P (hxiin−1, xi+1) − ϕ(P (hxiin−1, xi+1))

since ϕ(ti) ≥ 0

Hence, for all n,

= ti − ϕ(ti) ≤ ti.

r ≤ ti+1 ≤ ti

i.e. {ti}i∈N is a non-increasing sequence in R bounded below by r and, therefore, {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence

in R. Since R with the standard topology is a complete metric space, {ti}i∈N has a limit L such that for all

i,

i.e.

ϕ(ti) ≥ ϕ(L) ≥ ϕ(r) = 0

−ϕ(ti) ≤ −ϕ(L) ≤ 0.

Hence, by Deﬁnition 5.3.3

by induction

r ≤ ti+1 ≤ ti − ϕ(ti) ≤ ti − ϕ(L)

≤ ti−1 − ϕ(ti−1) − ϕ(L) ≤ ti−1 − 2ϕ(L)

ti+1 ≤ t1 − iϕ(L).

Assume that L > r then by Deﬁnition 5.3.3 ϕ(L) > 0. By taking i > t1−r

ϕ(L) we get

ti+1 ≤ t1 − iϕ(L) < t1 −

t1 − r
ϕ(L)

ϕ(L) = r

a contradiction since ti ≥ r. Therefore, L = r.

Step 2: We now show that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with central distance r by supposing that it is not

(a contrapositive approach). To do that we refer the reader back to Theorem 4.3.1 (c). From Deﬁnition 5.3.3

we know that for all i and j,

in particular, for i = j

r ≤ P (hxiin) ≤ P (hxiin−1, xi+1)

−P (hxiin) ≤ −r.

74

Hence, if {xi}i∈N is not a Cauchy sequence with central distance r then by Theorem 4.3.1 (d) there exists a

positive real number δ such that for every natural number N , there exists j ≥ i > N where

P (hxiin−1, xj ) ≥ r + δ > r.

Choose N1 = 1 then there exists j1 > i1 > N1 such that

P (hxi1 in−1, xj1 )) ≥ r + δ > r,

let m1 = i1 and n1 be the smallest number n1 > m1 such that

in other words

P (hxm1 in−1, xn1 ) ≥ r + δ

P (hxm1 in−1, xn1−1) < r + δ.

Now take N2 > max{m1, n1} then there exists j2 > i2 > N2 such that

P (hxi2 in−1, xj2 ) ≥ r + δ ≥ r + δ > r,

let m2 = i2 and n2 be the smallest number n2 > m2 such that

in other words

P (hxm2 in−1, xn2 ) ≥ r + δ ≥ r + δ

P (hxm2 in−1, xn2−1) < r + δ.

Continuing this process, we build two increasing sequences in N, {mk}k∈N and {nk}k∈N such that for all k,

P (hxmk in−1, xnk−1) < r + δ ≤ P (hxmk in−1, xnk ).

For all k, denote sk = P (hxmk in−1, xnk ). By (Pn-inq)

sk = P (hxmk in−1, xnk ) ≤ P (hxmk in−1, xnk−1) + P (hxnk −1in−1, xnk ) − P (hxnk −1in)

by Step 1

sk ≤ P (hxmk in−1, xnk−1) + tnk −1 − r

( ˜⊗)

Additionally, since {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence tending to r, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a

natural number N such that for all nk − 1 > N ,

r ≤ tnk−1 < r + ǫ.

Since {mk}k∈N and {nk}k∈N are increasing sequences, there exists a natural number N ′ such that for all

k > N ′, nk − 1 > N . Therefore for all k > N ′ and since r + δ ≤ sk,

0 ≤ sk − (r + δ)

75

from ( ˜⊗)

≤ P (hxmk in−1, xnk −1) + tnk−1 − r − (r + δ)

< (r + δ) + (r + ǫ) − r − (r + δ) = ǫ.

Therefore, {sk}k∈N is a Cauchy sequence with r + δ as a limit. On the other hand by applying (Pn-inq) we

get

by Step 1

by (Pn-inq)

sk = P (hxmk in−1, xnk ) ≤ P (hxmk in−1, xmk+1) + P (hxmk+1in−1, xnk ) − P (hxmk+1in)

≤ tmk + P (hxmk+1in−1, xnk ) − r

≤ tmk + P (hxmk+1in−1, xnk+1) + P (hxnk +1in−1, xnk ) − P (hxnk+1in) − r

by Corollary 2.5.4

≤ tmk + P (hxmk+1in−1, xnk+1) + (n − 1)P (hxnk in−1, xnk+1) − (n − 2)P (hxnk in) − P (hxnk+1in) − r

by Step 1

by Deﬁnition 5.3.3

≤ tmk + P (hxmk+1in−1, xnk+1) + (n − 1)tnk − (n − 2)r − r − r

≤ tmk + P (hxmk in−1, xnk ) − ϕ(P (hxmk in−1, xnk )) + (n − 1)tnk − (n − 2)r − r − r

and, hence,

therefore,

sk ≤ tmk + sk − ϕ(sk) + (n − 1)tnk − nr

ϕ(sk) ≤ tmk + (n − 1)tnk − nr.

Since r < r + δ ≤ sk and from Deﬁnition 5.3.3 we get

0 < ϕ(r + δ) ≤ ϕ(sk) ≤ tmk + (n − 1)tnk − nr

Additionally, since {ti}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence tending to r, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a

natural number N such that for all nk > mk > N ,

r ≤ tnk ≤ tmk < r +

ǫ
n

therefore, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all nk > mk > N ,

0 < ϕ(r + δ) < r +

+ (n − 1)(r +

) − nr = ǫ

and, hence,

0 < ϕ(r + δ) ≤ 0

76

a clear contradiction. Therefore, the assumption considered at the beginning of Step 2 is incorrect proving

that {xi}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence with central distance r.

Deﬁnition 5.3.4. Let (X, P ) be a partial n−Metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X →

X be two functions on X. For every real number r, we say that f and g are pairwise fr−contractive over (xo, yo)

if and only if there exists a real number 0 < c < 1 such that for all i,

r ≤ min{P (hf i(xo)in), P (hgi(xo)in}

Deﬁnition 5.3.5. Let (X, P ) be a partial n − Metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and

g : X → X be two functions on X. We say that f and g are Cauchy pairs over (xo, yo) if and only if

{f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form a Cauchy pair.

Theorem 5.3.3. (Cauchy Pairwise fr−Contractive):

Let (X, P ) be a partial n − Metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be two

functions on X. If f and g are pairwise fr−contractive over (xo, yo) then f and g are Cauchy pairs over

(xo, yo).

Proof: For all i, let xi = f i(xo) and yi = gi(yo). Let

M = max{|P (hf (xo)in−1, yo)|, |P (hxoin−1, yo)|}.

Step 1: From Deﬁnition 5.3.4 we know that

r ≤ min{P (hxiin), P (hyiin)}

P (hxi+1in−1, yi) ≤ r + ciM

( ¨⊗)

In particular, for all i,

Theorem 4.3.8 allows us to investigate P (hxiin−1, yj) for i ≥ j. Let us ﬁrst investigate what happens for

speciﬁc values of i and j. By repeatedly using (Pn-inq) we get

P (hx6in−1, y3)

≤ P (hx6in−1, y5) − P (hy5in) + P (hy5in−1, x5) − P (hx5in) + P (hx5in−1, y4) − P (hy4in)

+P (hy4in−1, x4) − P (hx4in) + P (hx4in−1, y3)

77

by Corollary 2.5.4

≤ P (hx6in−1, y5)−P (hy5in)+[(n−1)P (hx5in−1, y5)−(n−2)P (hx5in)]−P (hx5in)+P (hx5in−1, y4)−P (hy4in)

since cjM ≥ 0

= r + n[c5M + c4M ] + c3M

≤ r + n[c5M + c4M + c3M ].

We now move to derive an upper bound for P (hxiin−1, yj) where i ≥ j.

Case 1: If i = j, by ( ¨⊗) and since 0 < c < 1 and cjM ≥ 0,

r ≤ min{P (hxjin), P (hyjin)} ≤ P (hxj in−1, yj) ≤ r + cjM ≤ r + cj nM

Therefore, by Theorem 4.3.8, f and g are Cauchy pairs over (xo, yo).

Deﬁnition 5.3.6. Let (X, P ) and (Y, H) be two partial n − Metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y

be two functions on X. For every real number r we say that f and g are mutually fr−contractive if and

only if there exists two real numbers 0 < c < 1 and A ≥ 0 where such that for each x in X we can ﬁnd an

element z in X such that

H(hf (z)in−1, g(z)) − H(hf (z)in) ≤ c[H(hf (x)in−1, g(x)) − H(hf (x)in)]

and

r ≤ P (hzin) ≤ P (hzin−1, x) ≤ r + A[H(hf (x)in−1, g(x)) − H(hf (x)in)].

As in the case of partial metrics, the deﬁnition above is used in coincidence point theorems of strong

partial n − Metric. In the partial n − Metric case, a stronger contraction is needed.

Deﬁnition 5.3.7. Let (X, P ) and (Y, H) be two partial n − Metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y

be two functions on X. For every real number r we say that f and g are mutually (f, g)r−contractive if

and only if there exists two real numbers 0 < c < 1 and A ≥ 0 where such that for each x in X we can ﬁnd

an element z in X such that

H(hf (z)in−1, g(z)) − H(hg(z)in) ≤ c[H(hf (x)in−1, g(x)) − H(hg(x)in)]

r ≤ P (hzin) ≤ P (hzin−1, x) ≤ r + A[H(hf (x)in−1, g(x)) − H(hf (x)in)]

and

r ≤ P (hzin) ≤ P (hzin−1, x) ≤ r + A[H(hf (x)in−1, g(x)) − H(hg(x)in)].

Theorem 5.3.4. (Cauchy Mutually fr−Contractive):

Let (X, P ) and (Y, H) be two partial n − Metric spaces. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y be two functions on

X. If f and g are mutually fr−contractive then there exists a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X with central

distance r such that for all natural numbers i, r ≤ P (hxiin). Additionally for every positive real number ǫ

there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

H(hf (xi)in−1, g(xi)) − H(hf (xi)in) < ǫ.

79

Proof: Since f and g are mutually fr−contractive then there exists two real numbers 0 < c < 1 and

A ≥ 0 such that for each x in X, there exists a z in X where

H(hf (z)in−1, g(z)) − H(hf (z)in) ≤ c[H(hf (x)in−1, g(x)) − H(hf (x)in)]

and

r ≤ P (hzin) ≤ P (hzin−1, x) ≤ r + A[H(hf (x)in−1, g(x)) − H(hf (x)in)].

Let us take an arbitrary element x1 in X then there exists an element x2 in X such that

H(hf (x2)in−1, g(x2)) − H(hf (x2)in) ≤ c[H(hf (x1)in−1, g(x1)) − H(hf (x1)in)]

and

r ≤ P (hx2in) ≤ P (hx2in−1, x1) ≤ r + A[H(hf (x1)in−1, g(x1)) − H(hf (x1)in)].

There exists an element x3 in X such that

H(hf (x3)in−1, g(x3)) − H(hf (x3)in) ≤ c[H(hf (x2)in−1, g(x2)) − H(hf (x2)in)]

and

r ≤ P (hx3in) ≤ P (hx3in−1, x2) ≤ r + A[H(hf (x2)in−1, g(x2)) − H(hf (x2)in)].

We continue the above process to generate a sequence {xi}i∈N such that for all i,

H(hf (xi+1)in−1, g(xi+1)) − H(hf (xi+1)in) ≤ c[H(hf (xi)in−1, g(xi)) − H(hf (xi)in)]

and

r ≤ P (hxi+1in) ≤ P (hxi+1in−1, xn) ≤ r + A[H(hf (xi)in−1, g(xi)) − H(hf (xi)in)]

( ˇ⊗)

in particular, it is easy to see that for all i,

i.e.

r ≤ P (hxiin)

−P (hxiin) ≤ −r.

Step 1: For all i let ti = H(hf (xi)in−1, g(xi)) − H(hf (xi)in). Then, from ( ˇ⊗)

ti+1 = H(hf (xi+1)in−1, g(xi+1)) − H(hf (xi+1)in)

≤ c[H(hf (xi)in−1, g(xi)) − H(hf (xi)in)]

and, hence, by induction

ti+1 ≤ ciH(hf (x1)in−1, g(x1)) − H(hf (x1)in).

( ˆ⊗)

Therefore, and since 0 < c < 1 for every positive real number ǫ there exists natural number N ′ such that for

all i > N ′,

H(hf (xi)in−1, g(xi)) − H(hf (xi)in) < ǫ.

P (hf (xi)in−1, g(xi)) − P (hf (xi)in) < ǫ.

Chapter 6

Continuity and Non-Expansiveness

In Chapter 5, we established some criteria on functions that are suﬃcient to generate Cauchy sequences

and Cauchy pairs. Given that the limit (or special limit) of these sequences exist, we will need extra criteria

on the functions for them to have a ﬁxed point, common ﬁxed point or coincidence point.

Deﬁnition 6.0.1. Let (X, TX ) and (Y, TY ) be two topological spaces. Let f : X → Y be a function on X.

We say that f is continuous if and only if for every set U open in Y , f −1(U ) is open in X.

Deﬁnition 6.0.2. Let (X, TX ) and (Y, TY ) be two topological spaces. Let f : X → Y be a function on X.

We say that f is sequentially continuous if and only if for every sequence {xi}i∈N in X having a limit a

in X, f (a) is a limit of {f (xi)}i∈N.

Theorem 6.0.1. (Continuity vs. Sequential Continuity):

Let (X, TX ) and (Y, TY ) be two topological spaces. Let f : X → Y be a function on X. If (X, TX ) is ﬁrst

countable, then the the two statements below are equivalent.

(a) f is continuous.

(b) f is sequentially continuous.

The proof of Theorem 6.0.1 is found in [26]. This theorem is useful to us since all topologies discussed

in this thesis are ﬁrst countable. That is why when we need sequentially continuous, we will simply restate

continuity in the metric language. In most cases we only need sequential continuity on the orbit, even less,

we only need sequential continuity for the special limit rather than for any limit on that orbit.

Deﬁnition 6.0.3. Let (X, TX ) be a topological space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on X. We

say that f is orbitally continuous at xo if and only if a is a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N implies that f (a) is a

limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N.

Although the deﬁnition of a special limit is not a topological deﬁnition, but rather a deﬁnition deduced

from our generalized metrics, we will still deﬁne weakly orbitally continuous functions below to avoid repeating

the deﬁnition in each section. We will state the deﬁnition on a partial n − Metric space knowing that it

includes all other cases discussed in this thesis.

Deﬁnition 6.0.4. Let (X, P ) a partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a function on

X. We say that f is weakly orbitally continuous at xo if and only if a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N

implies that f (a) is a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N.

82

Notice that the diﬀerence between orbitally continuous and weakly orbitally continuous is that in the

latter we can only guarantee that f (a) is a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N if a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N. In ﬁrst

countable spaces Theorem 6.0.1 shows that continuity and sequential continuity become equivalent notions.

Hence, in ﬁrst countable spaces,

Continuous ⇐⇒ Sequentially Continuous ⇒ Orbitally Continuous at xo ⇒ Weakly Orbitally Continuous at xo.

The two notions left for us to deﬁne are non-expansiveness and consistency. We will present the partial

n − Metric case as it is our most general case.

Deﬁnition 6.0.5. Let (X, P ) a partial n − Metric space. Let f : X → X be a function on X. We say that

f is non-expansive if and only if for every two elements x and y in X,

P (hf (x)in−1, f (y)) ≤ P (hf (x)in−1, f (y)).

Deﬁnition 6.0.6. Let (X, P ) and (Y, H) two partial n − Metric spaces. Let f : X → Y be a function on X.

We say that f is consistent if and only if for every two element x and z in X, if

P (hxin) ≤ P (hzin)

H(hf (x)in) ≤ H(hf (z)in).

then

6.1 Metric Space

In the case of a metric space, the deﬁnition of non-expansive functions given in Deﬁnition 6.0.5 is written

as

d(f (x), f (y)) ≤ d(x, y).

The Lemmas presented in this section are folklore. Hence, we will state them while providing a minimal

proof.

Lemma 6.1.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space. If f : X → X is a non-expansive function on X then f is

continuous.

Lemma 6.1.2. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a non-expansive function on

X. If a is a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N, then f (a) = a.

(cid:3)

Proof: A non-expansive function on a metric space is continuous and, hence, by Theorem 6.0.1 sequen-

tially continuous. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 6.0.2 f (a) = a.

(cid:3)

In a metric space the deﬁnitions of orbitally continuous and weakly orbitally continuous coincide since

the deﬁnitions of special limits and limits coincide.

83

Lemma 6.1.3. Let (X, d) be a metric space with xo in X . Let f : X → X be a weakly orbitally continuous

function at xo. If a is a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N, then f (a) = a.

Proof: In a metric space the limit is unique and, hence, by Deﬁnition 6.0.2 f (a) = a.

(cid:3)

6.2 Partial Metric Space

As in Section 5.1 the results in this section are special cases of Section 6.3. We include the proofs because

they are much simpler than those of the more general results.

In the case of a partial metric space, the

deﬁnition of non-expansive functions given in Deﬁnition 6.0.5 is written as

p(f (x), f (y)) ≤ p(x, y).

Remark 6.2.1. In a metric space, a non-expansive function is continuous and, hence, weakly orbitally

continuous. Additionally in the metric case, as pointed out in Section 6.1, the notions of orbital continuity

and weak orbital continuity coincide. On the other hand, in a partial metric space, a non-expansive function

need not be continuous or even weakly orbitally continuous. Moreover, a weakly orbitally continuous function

need not be orbitally continuous. We show these important diﬀerences using the three examples below.

Example 6.2.2. (Non-Expansiveness vs Continuity):

Let p be a partial metric on X = R ∪ {a} where a /∈ R as deﬁned in Example 2.2.4 by:

For all x, y ∈ R,

Let

p(a, a) = 0, p(a, x) = |x| and p(x, y) = |x − y| − 1.

f (x) =

x

1




if x ∈ R.

if x = a.

The function f is non-expansive over R since

p(f (a), f (a)) = p(1, 1) = −1 ≤ 0 = p(a, a).

Additionally, for each x ∈ R,

p(f (a), f (x)) = p(1, x) = |x − 1| − 1 ≤ |x| = p(a, x).

On the other hand, a is a limit of { 1

2n }n∈N but f (a) = 1 is not. Hence, f is not sequentially continuous and

by Theorem 6.0.1 is not continuous.

Example 6.2.3. (Non-Expansiveness vs. Weak Orbital Continuity):

Let p : X × X → R be a partial metric on X = [−1, 1] as deﬁned in Example 2.2.3 by:

For all x, y ∈ R,

Let

For each x ∈ [−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1]

p(x, y) = max{x, y}.

f (x) =



p(f (0), f (x)) = p(−1,

) = max{−1,

x

} ≤ max{0, x} = p(0, x).

Hence, f is non-expansive. Showing that 0 is a special limit of {f n(1)}n∈N = { 1
to the reader. On the other hand, f (0) = −1 is not a limit of { 1

2n }n∈N since for each n ∈ N and ǫ < 1,

2n }n∈N is left as an exercise

p(−1,

2n ) − p(−1, −1) =

2n + 1 > 1 > ǫ.

Example 6.2.4. (Weak vs Usual Orbital Continuity):

Let p be a partial metric on X = R ∪ {a} where a /∈ R as deﬁned in Example 2.2.4 by

p(x, y) =

Let

if x = 0.

if x = a.

Then, the sequence {f n(1)}n∈N = { 1
of the sequence { 1

2n }n∈N. Moreover, f (0) = a is a limit (not a special limit though) of { 1

2n }n∈N. As shown in Example 2.2.4, 0 is a special limit and a is a limit
2n }n∈N whereas

f (a) = 5 is not. Hence, f is weakly orbitally continuous (but not orbitally continuous) at xo = 1.

Lemma 6.2.1. Let (X, p) a partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a non-expansive function

on X. If a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N then p(a, f (a)) = p(a, a).

Proof: Since a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N (see Deﬁnition 4.2.3) this sequence is a Cauchy sequence

with central distance r = p(a, a). From (p-lbnd) we know that

p(a, a) ≤ p(a, f (a))

by (p-inq)

≤ p(f (a), f i+1(xo)) + p(f i+1(xo), a) − p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo))

85

by (p-sym)

since f is non-expansive

= p(f (a), f i+1(xo)) + p(a, f i+1(xo)) − p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo))

≤ p(a, f i(xo)) + p(a, f i+1(xo)) − p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo)).

For every positive real number ǫ by Deﬁnition 4.2.1 there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i > N1

−p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo)) < −r +

and, since a special limit is a limit, by Lemma 4.2.1 there exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

p(a, f i(xo)) < p(a, a) +

ǫ
3

.

Therefore, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2} such that for all

i > N ,

p(a, a) ≤ p(a, f (a)) ≤ p(a, f i(xo)) + p(a, f i+1(xo)) − p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo))

Hence, p(a, a) = p(a, f (a)).

Lemma 6.2.2. Let (X, p) a partial metric space with xo ∈ X. Let f : X → X be a weakly orbitally continuous

function at xo. If a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N then p(a, f (a)) = p(f (a), f (a)).

Proof: From Deﬁnition 4.2.3, since a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N the that sequence is a Cauchy

sequence with central distance r = p(a, a). From (p-lbnd) we know that

p(f (a), f (a)) ≤ p(a, f (a))

by (p-inq)

by (p-sym)

≤ p(f (a), f i+1(xo)) + p(f i+1(xo), a) − p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo))

= p(f (a), f i+1(xo)) + p(a, f i+1(xo)) − p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo)).

For every positive real number ǫ by Deﬁnition 4.2.1 there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i > N1

−p(f i+1(xo), f i+1(xo)) < −r +

ǫ

Since a is a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N by Lemma 4.2.1 there exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

p(a, f i(xo) < p(a, a) +

ǫ
3

.

Furthermore, f is weakly orbitally continuous at xo and a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N hence, f (a)

is a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N. Therefore, from Lemma 4.2.1 there exists a natural number N3 such that for all

i > N3,

p(f (a), f i(xo)) < p(f (a), f (a)) +

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2, N3} such that for

Therefore, p(f (a), f (a)) = p(a, f (a)).

6.3 Partial n − Metric space

As in Section 5.3, the proofs of Section 6.3 are quite similar to Section 6.2 aside form the need to change

ǫ to ﬁt our needs. We still present the proofs for completeness.

Lemma 6.3.1. Let (X, P ) a partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a non-expansive

function on X. If a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N then

and

P (hain−1, f (a)) = P (hain)

P (hf (a)in−1, a) ≤ P (hain).

Proof: From Deﬁnition 4.3.2, since a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N then this sequence is a Cauchy

sequence with central distance r = P (hain). From (Pn-lbnd) we know that

P (hain) ≤ P (hain−1, f (a))

by (Pn-inq)

≤ P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) + P (hf i+1(xo)in−1, f (a)) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

since f is non-expansive

≤ P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) + P (hf i(xo)in−1, a) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

and by Corollary 2.5.4

≤ P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hain−1, f i(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hain) − P (hf i+1(xo)in).

By Deﬁnition 4.3.1, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i > N1,

−P (hf i(xo)in) < −r +

ǫ

n + 1

= −P (hain) +

ǫ

n + 1

.

Since a special limit is a limit, by Lemma 4.3.2 there exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

P (hain−1, f i(xo)) < P (hain) +

ǫ

n + 1

.

87

Therefore, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2, N3} such that

for all i > N ,

P (hain) ≤ P (hain−1, f (a))

≤ P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hain−1, f i(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hain) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

< P (hain) +

= P (hain) + ǫ.

ǫ

n + 1
ǫ

n + 1

Hence, P (hain) = P (hain−1, f (a)).

Similarly by (Pn-inq)

P (hf (a)in−1, a) ≤ P (hf (a)in−1, f i+1(xo)) + P (hf i+1(xo)in−1, a) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

since f is non-expansive

≤ P (hain−1, f i(xo)) + P (hf i+1(xo)in−1, a) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

by Corollary 2.5.4

≤ P (hain−1, f i(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hain) − P (hf i+1(xo)in).

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

P (hf (a)in−1, a)

≤ P (hain−1, f i(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hain) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

< P (hain) +

ǫ

n + 1

+ (n − 1)(P (hain) +

= P (hain) + ǫ.

n + 1

Therefore, P (hf (a)in−1, a) ≤ P (hain).

(cid:3)

Lemma 6.3.2. Let (X, P ) a partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be weakly orbitally

continuous function at xo. If a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N then

and

P (hf (a)in−1, a) = P (hf (a)in)

P (hain−1, f (a)) ≤ P (hf (a)in).

Proof: From Deﬁnition 4.3.2, since a is a special limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N then that sequence is a Cauchy

sequence with central distance r = P (hain). From (Pn-lbnd) we know that

P (hf (a)in) ≤ P (hf (a)in−1, a)

88

by (Pn-inq)

by Corollary 2.5.4

≤ P (hf (a)in−1, f i+1(xo)) + P (hf i+1(xo)in−1, a) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

≤ P (hf (a)in−1, f i+1(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hain) − P (hf i+1(xo)in).

By Deﬁnition 4.3.1, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i > N1,

−P (hf i(xo)in) < −r +

ǫ

2n − 1

= −P (hain) +

ǫ

n + 1

Since a special limit is a limit, by Lemma 4.3.2 there exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

P (hain−1, f i(xo)) < P (hain) +

ǫ

n + 1

.

Since f is weakly orbitally continuous at xo then f (a) is also a limit of {f i(xo)}i∈N then there exists a natural

number N3 such that for all i > N3,

P (hf (a)in−1, f i(xo)) < P (hf (a)in) +

ǫ

n + 1

.

Therefore, N = max{N1, N2, N3} is a natural number such that for all i > N ,

P (hf (a)in) ≤ P (hf (a)in−1, a)

≤ P (hf (a)in−1, f i+1(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hain) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

< P (hf (a)in) +

Hence, P (hf (a)in) = P (hf (a)in−1, a).

Similarly by (Pn-inq)

P (hain−1, f (a)) ≤ P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) + P (hf i+1(xo)in−1, f (a)) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

by Corollary 2.5.4

≤ P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hf (a)in−1, f i+1(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hf (a)in) − P (hf i+1(xo)in).

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N such that for all i > N ,

≤ P (hain−1, f i+1(xo)) + (n − 1)P (hf (a)in−1, f i+1(xo)) − (n − 2)P (hf (a)in) − P (hf i+1(xo)in)

P (hain−1, f (a))

< P (hain) +

Chapter 7

Applications to Fixed point and Coincidence Point

Theory.

We have reached the end of the rainbow to ﬁnd our pot of gold. In this chapter we state ﬁxed point,

common ﬁxed point, and coincidence point theorems whose sole requirement from the generalized metric

spaces is that they be complete. This thesis was intentionally written in such a way that minimizes the

proofs of this section. Although these theorems are cumbersome to prove on their own, we have extensively

stated and proved theorems and lemmas in previous chapters to create solid building blocks for the theorems

ahead. As previously stated, a (strong) partial n − Metric is a generalization of a (strong) partial metric.

Any special technique needed for the (strong) partial n − Metric case has already been presented in previous

chapters. That is why we will be omitting the proofs of Section 7.4 and Section 7.5 to spare the reader any

redundancy. We start with some basic deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 7.0.1. Let X be a non-empty set. Let f : X → X be a function on X. We say that x in X is a

ﬁxed point of f if and only if f (x) = x.

Deﬁnition 7.0.2. Let X be a non-empty set. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be two functions on X. We

say that x in X is a common ﬁxed point of f and g if and only if f (x) = x = g(x).

Deﬁnition 7.0.3. Let X and Y be two non-empty sets. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y be two functions on

X. We say that x in X is a coincidence point of f and g if and only if f (x) = g(x).

7.1 Metric Space

Depending on the type of the contractive function used, Theorem 7.1.1 and Theorem 7.1.2 can be at-

tributed to either Edelstein[10, 11, 12] or Alber and S. Guerre-Delabriere [1].

Theorem 7.1.1. (Fixed point and Non-expansive):

Let (X, d) be a complete metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X a Cauchy function at xo. If f is

non-expansive then f has a ﬁxed point in X.

Proof: Since f is Cauchy at xo then by Deﬁnition 5.1.1, {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. Since (X, d)

is a complete metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.1.2 {f i(xo)}i∈N has a limit a in X. Finally f is non-expansive,

90

then by Lemma 6.1.1 f (a) = a and, hence, by Deﬁnition 7.0.3 a is a ﬁxed point of f.

(cid:3)

In fact, Theorem 7.1.1 can be considered a corollary of Theorem 7.1.2 since any non-expansive function

in a metric space is continuous.

Theorem 7.1.2. (Fixed point and Weak orbital continuity):

Let (X, d) be a complete metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X a Cauchy function at xo. If f is weakly

orbitally continuous at xo then f has a ﬁxed point in X.

Proof: Since f is Cauchy at xo then by Deﬁnition 5.1.1, {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. Since (X, d)

is a complete metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.1.2 {f i(xo)}i∈N has a limit a in X. Finally f is weakly

orbitally continuous at xo, then by Lemma 6.1.2 f (a) = a and, hence, by Deﬁnition 7.0.3 a is a ﬁxed point

of f.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.1.1. From Lemma 5.1.1 and Lemma 5.1.2, if f is orbitally contractive or orbitally ϕ−contractive

at xo then f is Cauchy at xo.

Theorem 7.1.3. (Common ﬁxed point and Non-expansive):

Let (X, d) be a complete metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be a Cauchy pair

over (xo, yo). If f and g are non-expansive then f and g have a common ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f and g Cauchy pairs at (xo, yo) then by Deﬁnition 5.1.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form

a Cauchy pair. By Lemma 4.1.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences. Since (X, d) is a

complete metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.1.2 and Lemma 4.1.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N both have the

same limit a in X. Finally f and g are both non-expansive, then by Lemma 6.1.1 f (a) = a = g(a) and,

hence, by Deﬁnition 7.0.2 a is a common ﬁxed point of f and g.

(cid:3)

Theorem 7.1.4. (Common ﬁxed point and Weak orbital continuity):

Let (X, d) be a complete metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be a Cauchy

pair over (xo, yo). If f and g are weakly orbitally continuous at xo and yo respectively then f and g have a

common ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f and g Cauchy pairs at (xo, yo) then by Deﬁnition 5.1.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form

a Cauchy pair. By Lemma 4.1.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences. Since (X, d) is

a complete metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.1.2 and Lemma 4.1.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N both have

the same limit a in X. Finally f and g are weakly orbitally continuous at xo and yo respectively, then by

Lemma 6.1.2 f (a) = a = g(a) and, hence, by Deﬁnition 7.0.2 a is a common ﬁxed point of f and g.

(cid:3)

Theorem 7.1.5. (Common ﬁxed point and Mixed criteria):

Let (X, d) be a complete metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be a Cauchy pair

over (xo, yo). If f is non-expansive and g is weakly orbitally continuous at yo then f and g have a common

ﬁxed point.

91

Proof: Since f and g Cauchy pairs at (xo, yo) then by Deﬁnition 5.1.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form

a Cauchy pair. By Lemma 4.1.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences. Since (X, d) is a

complete metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.1.2 and Lemma 4.1.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N both have the

same limit a in X. Finally f is non-expansive then by Lemma 6.1.1 f (a) = a and g are weakly orbitally

continuous at yo then by Lemma 6.1.2 a = g(a) and, hence, by Deﬁnition 7.0.2 a is a common ﬁxed point of

f and g.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.1.2. From Theorem 5.1.3, if f and g are pairwise f −contractive( similarly g−contractive) over

(xo, yo) then f and g form a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo).

Theorem 7.1.6. (Coincidence Point Theorem):

Let (X, l) be a complete metric space and let (Y, d) be a metric space. Let f : X → Y and g : X → Y two

sequentially continuous functions on X. If f and g are mutually contractive then f and g have a coincidence

point.

Proof: Since f and g are mutually contractive then by Theorem 5.1.4 there exists a Cauchy sequence

{xi}i∈N in X where {f (xi)}i∈N and {g(xi)}i∈N form a cauchy pair in Y . Hence, by Deﬁnition 4.1.3 for every

positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N1 such that for all i > N1,

d(f (xi), g(xi)) <

ǫ
3

since (X, l) is complete then {xi}i∈N has a limit a in X. Since f and g sequentially continuous then by

Deﬁnition 6.0.2 f (a) and g(a) are limits of {f (xi)}i∈N and {g(xi)}i∈N respectively.

f (a) is the limit of {f (xi)}i∈N hence, by Lemma 4.1.1 there exists a natural number N2 such that for all

i > N2,

d(f (a), f (xi)) <

ǫ
3

g(a) is the limit of {g(xi)}i∈N hence, by Lemma 4.1.1 there exists a natural number N3 such that for all

i > N3,

d(f (a), f (xi)) <

ǫ
3

.

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2, N3} such that for

all i > N , by (n-lbnd)

using (d-inq) twice we get

by (d-sym)

0 ≤ d(f (a), g(a))

≤ d(f (a), f (xi)) + d(f (xi), g(xi)) + d(g(xi), g(a))

d(f (a), f (xi)) + d(f (xi), g(xi)) + d(g(a), g(xi))

<

= ǫ.

Therefore, d(f (a), g(a)) = 0 and by (d-sep) f (a) = g(a) and, hence, by Deﬁnition 7.0.3 a is a coincidence

point of f and g.

7.2 Partial Metric Space

Theorem 7.2.1. (Fixed point and Partial metrics[3]):

Let (X, p) be a complete partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a Cauchy function at xo. If f

is non-expansive and weakly orbitally continuous at xo then f has a ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f is Cauchy at xo then by Deﬁnition 5.2.1, {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. Since (X, p)

is a complete partial metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.2.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N has a special limit a in X.

Since f is non-expansive then by Lemma 6.2.1

p(a, f (a)) = p(a, a)

since f is weakly orbitally continuous at xo then by Lemma 6.2.2

p(a, f (a)) = p(f (a), f (a))

and, hence, by (p-sep) f (a) = a. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.1 a is a ﬁxed point of f.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.2.1. From Lemma 5.2.2 and Theorem 5.2.3, if f is orbitally r−contractive or orbitally ϕr−contractive

at xo then f is Cauchy at xo.

Theorem 7.2.2. (Common ﬁxed point and Partial metrics):

Let (X, p) be a complete partial metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be a

Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f and g are non-expansive and f and g are weakly orbitally continuous on xo

and yo respectively then f and g have a common ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f and g Cauchy pairs at (xo, yo) then by Deﬁnition 5.2.5 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form

a Cauchy pair. By Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences. Since (X, p) is a

complete partial metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.2.4 and Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N both

have the same special limit a in X.

Since f and g are both non-expansive then by Lemma 6.2.1

p(a, a) = p(a, f (a)) and p(a, a) = p(a, g(a))

since f and g are weakly orbitally continuous on xo and yo respectively then by Lemma 6.2.2

p(f (a), f (a)) = p(a, f (a)) and p(g(a), g(a)) = p(a, g(a))

and, hence, by (p-sep) f (a) = a = g(a). Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.2 a is a common ﬁxed point of f and

g.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.2.2. From Theorem 5.2.3, if f and g are pairwise fr−contractive( similarly gr−contractive) over

(xo, yo) then f and g form a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo).

Theorem 7.2.3. (Coincidence Point Theorem):

Let (X, p) be a complete partial metric space and let (Y, h) be a partial metric space. Let f : X → Y and

g : X → Y two sequentially continuous and consistent functions on X. If f and g are mutually (f, g)r-

contractive then f and g have a coincidence point.

Proof: Since f and g are mutually (f, g)r-contractive then they are mutually fr-contractive. Hence, by

Theorem 5.2.4 there exists a Cauchy sequence {xi}i∈N in X. Let r be the central distance of {xi}i∈N then

again by Theorem 5.2.4 for all natural numbers i,

Since (X, p) is complete partial metric space then {xi}i∈N has a special limit a in X. From Deﬁnition 4.2.3

r ≤ p(xi, xi).

for all natural numbers i,

g is consistent then

and, hence,

r = p(a, a) ≤ p(xi, xi).

h(g(a), g(a)) ≤ h(g(xi), g(xi))

−h(g(xi), g(xi)) ≤ −h(g(a), g(a)).

For every positive real number ǫ we know that:

since g is sequentially continuous, by Deﬁnition 6.0.2 g(a) is a limit of {g(xi)}i∈N. Therefore, there exists a

natural number N1 such that for all i > N1,

h(g(a), g(xi)) < h(g(a), g(a)) +

ǫ
3

.

Similarly, f is sequentially continuous hence, by Deﬁnition 6.0.2 f (a) is limit of {f (xi)}i∈N. Therefore, there

exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

h(f (a), f (xi)) < h(f (a), f (a)) +

ǫ
3

.

By Theorem 5.2.4, there exists a natural number N3 such that for all i > N3,

h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi)) <

ǫ
3

.

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2, N3} such that for

all i > N ,by (p-lbnd)

using (p-inq) twice we get for all i

h(f (a), f (a)) ≤ h(f (a), g(a))

≤ h(f (a), f (xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi)) + h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(g(xi), g(xi)) + h(g(xi), g(a))

94

by (p-sym)

= h(f (a), f (xi)) + h(f (xi), g(xi)) − h(f (xi), f (xi)) − h(g(xi), g(xi)) + h(g(a), g(xi))

< h(f (a), f (a)) +

ǫ
3

+

ǫ
3

− h(g(a), g(a)) + h(g(a), g(a)) +

ǫ
3

= h(f (a), f (a)) + ǫ.

Therefore, h(f (a), f (a)) = h(f (a), g(a)). Repeating the above process with f and g being gr−contractive

and f being consistent we get h(g(a), g(a)) = h(f (a), g(a)) and, hence, by (p-sep) f (a) = g(a).Therefore, by

Deﬁnition 7.0.3 a is a coincidence point of f and g.

7.3 Strong Partial Metric Space

We remind our reader that (s-lbnd) is a stronger version of (p-sep). Hence, if (X, s) is a strong partial

metric space, for any two element x and z in X, it is enough to have s(x, z) ≤ s(x, x) to deduce that x = z.

Therefore, we are able to relax the requirements on the functions studied to assert the existence of the ﬁxed

point, common ﬁxed point or coincidence point in question.

Theorem 7.3.1. (Fixed point and Non-expansive[3]):

Let (X, s) be a complete strong partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a Cauchy function at

xo. If f is non-expansive then f has a ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f is Cauchy at xo then by Deﬁnition 5.2.1, {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. Since (X, s)

is a complete strong partial metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.2.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N has a special limit a in X.

Since f is non-expansive then by Lemma 6.2.1

s(a, f (a)) = s(a, a)

and, hence by (s-lbnd) f (a) = a. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.1 a is a ﬁxed point of f.

(cid:3)

Theorem 7.3.2. (Fixed point and Weak orbital continuity[3]):

Let (X, s) be a complete strong partial metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a Cauchy function at

xo. If f is weakly orbitally continuous at xo then f has a ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f is Cauchy at xo then by Deﬁnition 5.2.1, {f i(xo)}i∈N is a Cauchy sequence. Since (X, p)

is a complete partial metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.2.4 {f i(xo)}i∈N has a special limit a in X. Since f is

weakly orbitally continuous at xo then by Lemma 6.2.2

and, hence, by (s-lbnd) f (a) = a. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.1 a is a ﬁxed point of f.

(cid:3)

s(a, f (a)) = s(f (a), f (a))

95

Remark 7.3.1. From Lemma 5.2.2 and Lemma 5.2.1, if f is orbitally r−contractive or orbitally ϕr−contractive

at xo then f is Cauchy at xo.

Theorem 7.3.3. (Common ﬁxed point and Non-expansive):

Let (X, s) be a complete strong partial metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be

a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f and g are non-expansive then f and g have a common ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f and g Cauchy pairs at (xo, yo) then by Deﬁnition 5.1.5 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form

a Cauchy pair. By Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences. Since (X, s) is a

complete strong partial metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.2.4 and Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N

both have the same special limit a in X. Since f and g are both non-expansive then by Lemma 6.2.2

p(a, a) = p(a, f (a)) and p(a, a) = p(a, g(a))

and, hence, by (s-lbnd) f (a) = a = g(a). Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.2 a is a common ﬁxed point of f and

g.

(cid:3)

Theorem 7.3.4. (Common ﬁxed point and Weak orbital continuity):

Let (X, s) be a complete strong partial metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be

a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f and g are weakly orbitally continuous on xo and yo respectively then f and

g have a common ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f and g Cauchy pairs at (xo, yo) then by Deﬁnition 5.1.5 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form

a Cauchy pair. By Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences. Since (X, s) is a

complete strong partial metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.2.4 and Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N

both have the same special limit a in X. Since f and g are weakly orbitally continuous on xo and yo

respectively then

p(f (a), f (a)) = p(a, f (a)) and p(g(a), g(a)) = p(a, g(a))

and, hence, by (s-lbnd) f (a) = a = g(a). Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.2 a is a common ﬁxed point of f and

g.

(cid:3)

Theorem 7.3.5. (Common ﬁxed point and Mixed criteria):

Let (X, s) be a complete strong partial metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be

a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f is non-expansive and g is weakly orbitally continuous on yo then f and g

have a common ﬁxed point.

Proof: Since f and g Cauchy pairs at (xo, yo) then by Deﬁnition 5.1.5 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N form

a Cauchy pair. By Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N are both Cauchy sequences. Since (X, p) is a

complete partial metric space then by Deﬁnition 4.2.4 and Lemma 4.2.6 {f i(xo)}i∈N and {gi(yo)}i∈N both

have the same special limit a in X.

96

Since f is non-expansive then by Lemma 6.2.1

and, hence by (s-lbnd)

p(a, a) = p(a, f (a))

f (a) = a.

Since g is weakly orbitally continuous on yo then by Lemma 6.2.2

p(g(a), g(a)) = p(a, g(a))

and, hence, by (s-lbnd) f (a) = a = g(a). Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.2 a is a common ﬁxed point of f and

g.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.3.2. From Theorem 5.2.3 , if f and g are pairwise fr−contractive( similarly gr−contractive)

over (xo, yo) then f and g form a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo).

Theorem 7.3.6. (Coincidence Point Theorem):

Let (X, p) be a complete partial metric space and let (Y, s) be a strong partial metric space. Let f : X → Y

and g : X → Y two sequentially continuous functions on X. If f and g are mutually fr-contractive and g is

consistent then f and g have a coincidence point.

Proof: Since f and g are mutually fr-contractive then by Theorem 5.2.4 there exists a Cauchy sequence

{xi}i∈N in X. Let r be the central distance of {xi}i∈N then again by Theorem 5.2.4 for all natural numbers

i,

r ≤ p(xi, xi).

Since (X, p) is complete partial metric space then {xi}i∈N has a special limit a in X. From Deﬁnition 4.2.3

for all natural numbers i,

g is consistent then

and, hence,

r = p(a, a) ≤ p(xi, xi).

s(g(a), g(a)) ≤ s(g(xi), g(xi))

−s(g(xi), g(xi)) ≤ −s(g(a), g(a)).

For every positive real number ǫ we know that:

since g is sequentially continuous, by Deﬁnition 6.0.2 g(a) is limit of {g(xi)}i∈N. Therefore, there exists a

natural number N1 such that for all i > N1,

s(g(a), g(xi)) < s(g(a), g(a)) +

ǫ
3

.

Similarly, f is sequentially continuous hence, by Deﬁnition 6.0.2 f (a) is limit of {f (xi)}i∈N. Therefore, there

exists a natural number N2 such that for all i > N2,

s(f (a), f (xi)) < s(f (a), f (a)) +

ǫ
3

.

97

By Theorem 5.2.4, there exists a natural number N3 such that for all i > N3,

s(f (xi), g(xi)) − s(f (xi), f (xi)) <

ǫ
3

.

Hence, for every positive real number ǫ there exists a natural number N = max{N1, N2, N3} such that for

all i > N , using (s-inq) twice

h(f (a), g(a)) ≤ s(f (a), f (xi)) − s(f (xi), f (xi)) + s(f (xi), g(xi)) − s(g(xi), g(xi)) + s(g(xi), g(a))

by (s-sym)

= s(f (a), f (xi)) + s(f (xi), g(xi)) − s(f (xi), f (xi)) − s(g(xi), g(xi)) + s(g(a), g(xi))

< h(f (a), f (a)) +

ǫ
3

+

ǫ
3

− h(g(a), g(a)) + h(g(a), g(a)) +

ǫ
3

= s(f (a), f (a)) + ǫ.

Therefore, s(f (a), g(a)) ≤ s(f (a), f (a)). Hence, by (s-lbnd) f (a) = g(a). Therefore, by Deﬁnition 7.0.3 a is

a coincidence point of f and g.

7.4 Partial n − Metric Space

Theorem 7.4.1. (Fixed point and Partial n − Metrics[2]):

Let (X, P ) be a complete partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a Cauchy function at xo.

If f is non-expansive and weakly orbitally continuous at xo then f has a ﬁxed point.

Remark 7.4.1. From Lemma 5.3.1 and Lemma 5.3.2, if f is orbitally r−contractive or orbitally ϕr−contractive

at xo then f is Cauchy at xo.

Theorem 7.4.2. (Common ﬁxed point and Partial n − Metrics):

Let (X, P ) be a complete partial n − Metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X be a

Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f and g are non-expansive and f and g are weakly orbitally continuous on xo

and yo respectively then f and g have a common ﬁxed point.

Remark 7.4.2. From Theorem 5.3.3, if f and g are pairwise fr−contractive( similarly gr−contractive) over

(xo, yo) then f and g form a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo).

Theorem 7.4.3. (Coincidence Point Theorem):

Let (X, P ) be a complete partial n − Metric space and let (Y, H) be a partial n − Metric space. Let f : X → Y

and g : X → Y be two sequentially continuous and consistent functions on X. If f and g are mutually (f, g)r-

contractive then f and g have a coincidence point.

7.5 Strong Partial n − Metric Space

In this section again, we remind our reader that (Sn-lbnd) is a stronger version of (Pn-sep). Hence,

if (X, S) is a strong partial n − Metric space, for any two element x and z in X, it is enough to have

S(hxin−1, z) ≤ S(hxin) to deduce that x = z. Therefore, we are able to relax the requirements on the

functions studied in Section 7.4 to assert the existence of the ﬁxed point, common ﬁxed point or coincidence

point in question.

Theorem 7.5.1. (Fixed point and Non-expansive[2]):

Let (X, S) be a complete strong partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a Cauchy function

at xo. If f is non-expansive then f has a ﬁxed point.

Let (X, S) be a complete strong partial n − Metric space with xo in X. Let f : X → X be a Cauchy function

at xo. If f is weakly orbitally continuous at xo then f has a ﬁxed point.

Remark 7.5.1. From Lemma 5.3.1 and Lemma 5.3.2, if f is orbitally r−contractive or orbitally ϕr−contractive

at xo then f is Cauchy at xo.

Theorem 7.5.3. (Common ﬁxed point and Non-expansive):

Let (X, S) be a complete strong partial n − Metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X

be a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f and g are non-expansive then f and g have a common ﬁxed point.

Theorem 7.5.4. (Common ﬁxed point and Weak orbital continuity):

Let (X, S) be a complete strong partial n − Metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X

be a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f and g are weakly orbitally continuous on xo and yo respectively then f

and g have a common ﬁxed point.

Theorem 7.5.5. (Common ﬁxed point and Mixed criteria):

Let (X, S) be a complete strong partial n − Metric space with xo and yo in X. Let f : X → X and g : X → X

be a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo). If f is non-expansive and g is weakly orbitally continuous on yo then f and

g have a common ﬁxed point.

Remark 7.5.2. From Theorem 5.3.3, if f and g are pairwise fr−contractive( similarly gr−contractive) over

(xo, yo) then f and g form a Cauchy pair over (xo, yo).

Theorem 7.5.6. (Coincidence Point Theorem):

Let (X, P ) be a complete partial n − Metric space and let (Y, S) be a strong partial n − Metric space. Let

f : X → Y and g : X → Y two sequentially continuous functions on X. If f and g are mutually fr-contractive

and g is consistent then f and g have a coincidence point.
