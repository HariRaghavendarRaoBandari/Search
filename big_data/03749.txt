The nonmodal linear stability of the Schwarzschild black hole established in Phys. Rev. Lett.
112 (2014) 191101 is generalized to the case of a nonnegative cosmological constant Λ. Two gauge
invariant combinations G± of perturbed scalars made out of the Weyl tensor and its ﬁrst covariant
derivative are found such that the map [hαβ] → (G− ([hαβ ]) , G+ ([hαβ])) with domain the set
of equivalent classes [hαβ] under gauge transformations of solutions of the linearized Einstein’s
equation, is invertible. The way to reconstruct a representative of [hαβ] in terms of (G−, G+) is
given. It is proved that, for an arbitrary perturbation consistent with the background asymptote,
G+ and G− are bounded in the the outer static region. At large times, the perturbation decays
leaving a linearized Kerr black hole around the Schwarzschild or Schwarschild de Sitter background
solution. For negative cosmological constant it is shown that there is a choice of boundary conditions
at the time-like boundary under which the Schwarzschild anti de Sitter black hole is unstable. The
root of Chandrasekhar’s duality relating odd and even modes is exhibited, and some technicalities
related to this duality and omitted in the original proof of the Λ = 0 case are explained in detail.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most salient open problems in classical General Relativity (GR) is proving the stability of the outer
region of the stationary electro-vacuum black holes in the Kerr-Newman family. A complete proof of stability in the
context of the non linear GR equations has only been given for Minkowski spacetime [6]; the stability problem of
more complex solutions of Einstein’s equation is usually approached by analyzing the behavior of linear test ﬁelds
satisfying appropriate boundary conditions in order to establish if unbounded solutions are allowed. Scalar test ﬁelds
provide a ﬁrst clue, whereas gravitational waves, that is, metric perturbations hαβ propagating on the background
spacetime (M, gαβ), give a more realistic approach to the problem. For vacuum spacetimes, assuming a cosmological
constant Λ, the metric perturbation hαβ satisﬁes the linearized Einstein equation (LEE)

E[hαβ] := − 1

obtained by assuming that on a ﬁxed four dimensional manifold M (the spacetime) there is a mono-parametric family
of solutions gαβ(ǫ) of the vacuum Einstein ﬁeld equation

around the “unperturbed background” gαβ = gαβ(0), and Taylor expanding (2) at ǫ = 0. For tensor ﬁelds that depend
functionally on the metric we use a dot to denote the “perturbed ﬁeld”, which is the ﬁeld obtained by taking the ﬁrst
derivative with respect to ǫ at ǫ = 0, e.g., for the Riemann tensor,

Rαβ[g(ǫ)] − Λgαβ(ǫ) = 0

We make an exception for the metric ﬁeld itself by adopting the standard notation hαβ = ˙gαβ and, as usually done
β = gαµhµβ, and hαβ = gαµgβνhµν. Note that this convention implies that
in linear perturbation theory, deﬁning hα

Equation (1) is the ﬁrst order Taylor coeﬃcient of (2) around ǫ = 0, that is E[hαβ] = ˙Rαβ − Λhαβ. Trivial solutions
of this equation are

hαβ = £ξgαβ = ∇αξβ + ∇βξα,

(4)

˙gαβ = −hαβ.

where ξα is an arbitrary vector ﬁeld; these amount to the ﬁrst order in ǫ change of the metric under the pullback by
the ﬂow Φξ

ǫ : M → M generated by the vector ﬁeld ξα. Any two solutions hαβ and h′

αβ such that

are related by this diﬀeomorphism and thus physically equivalent, this being the gauge freedom of linearized gravity. If
a tensor ﬁeld T is a functional of the metric g, then ˙T is a linear functional of hαβ and, under the gauge transformation
(5) we ﬁnd that

h′
αβ = hαβ + £ξgαβ,

(5)

˙T is gauge invariant iﬀ 0 = £ξT = ξα∂αT , that is, if T vanishes in the background.
In particular, if T is a scalar ﬁeld,
Curvature related scalar ﬁelds (CS for short, not to be confused with the tetrad components of the Weyl tensor in the

˙T [h′] = ˙T [h] + £ξT.

(6)

Newman-Penrose formalism), are those scalar ﬁelds obtained by contraction from a polynomial in the Riemann tensor
and its covariant derivatives, the metric and the volume form. Although these ﬁelds partially characterize the metric,
it is well known that the information they carry is limited, an extreme example of this fact being the vanishing scalar
invariants spacetimes, which have a nonzero Riemann tensor and yet every CS vanishes [22]. This fact may suggest
that the perturbation of the CSs under a given solution hαβ of the LEE provide very limited information on hαβ. It
was shown in [9], however, that for a Schwarzschild black hole background, there are two gauge invariant combinations
G± of perturbed CSs that fully characterize the gauge equivalence class [hαβ] of the corresponding solution of the
LEE. More precisely, let Cα

βγδ be the Weyl tensor, εαβµν the volume form, and consider the CSs

[hαβ] → (G− ([hαβ]) , G+ ([hαβ]))

with domain the equivalence classes of smooth solutions of the LEE preserving the asymptotic ﬂatness, is injective.
This imply that the scalars G±, beyond measuring the “amount of distortion” caused by the perturbation, encode
all the relevant information on the perturbation class [hαβ]. A way to construct a class representative hαβ from the
ﬁelds G± ([hαβ]) is indicated in [9].

The stability concept introduced in [9] is based on i) the existence of the CSs G± for which (9) is injective on
smooth solutions of the LEE that preserve the asymptotic ﬂatness, and ii) the proof that for this class of solutions of
the LEE the scalar ﬁelds G± ([hαβ]) are bounded. More precisely, it is proved in [9] that in the outer region r ≥ 2M

|G−| <

K−
r6 ,

|G+| <

(10)

where K± are constants that can be obtained from the perturbation ﬁeld datum at a Cauchy slice. Given that the
scalars G± contain all the gauge invariant information on the perturbation, the fact that they remain bounded as the
perturbation evolves through spacetime gives a meaningful linear stability notion.

It is important to compare this concept of stability, that we call nonmodal, with prior Schwarzschild linear gravity
stability notions. To this end we review the results of a short list of papers that were crucial in the development of
this subject. It is important to stress that they all use the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime to
decompose a metric perturbation

hαβ = X(ℓ,m,p=±)

h(ℓ,m,p=±)
αβ

(11)

into even (p = +) and odd (p = −) (ℓ, m) modes. Here ℓ refers to the eigenspace of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
acting on real scalar ﬁelds on S2 corresponding to the eigenvalue −ℓ(ℓ + 1), m is an index labeling a particular basis
of this 2ℓ + 1 dimensional space, and the parity p accounts for the way h(ℓ,m,p=±)
transforms when pull-backed by
the antipodal map on S2.

The ﬁrst work on the linear stability of the Schwarzschild black hole is T. Regge and J. Wheeler 1957 paper [24],
where the decomposition (11) was proposed and the ℓ = 0, 1 modes where recognized to be non-dynamical. At the
time the very notion of black hole was unclear (the term “black hole” was coined by J. Wheeler some ten years
later), and Kerr’s solution had not yet been discovered. This is probably why, although the ℓ = 0 even piece of the
perturbation was readily identiﬁed as a mass shift in [24], the odd ℓ = 1 modes, which corresponds to perturbing
along a Kerr family gαβ(ǫ) with ǫ = J/M , was misunderstood (see the paragraph between equations (37) and (38)
in [24]) and the opportunity of producing a “slowly rotating” black hole at a time when there was no clue about a
rotating black hole solution was missed [? ]. The decomposition (11) in [24] was done in Schwarzschild coordinates
(t, r, θ, φ) in what came to be called the Regge-Wheeler (RW, for short) gauge. The LEE in the even and odd sectors

were shown to decouple, and the dynamical odd sector of the LEE reduced to an inﬁnite set of two dimensional wave
equations, individually know as known as the RW equation:

For Λ 6= 0 the RW and Zerilli potentials ﬁrst appeared in [15]. The solution of the LEE in the RW gauge is then given
in the form

where D(ℓ,m,p=±)
(ℓ,m) and the spherical harmonics S(ℓ,m). Note that,
since focus is on non-stationary modes, only ℓ ≥ 2 enter this formulation. The (non-stationary) solution space of the
LEE is thus parametrized by the inﬁnite set of scalar ﬁelds φ±

(ℓ,m) that enter the series (11) through (14).

Every notion of gravitational linear stability prior to [9] was concerned with the behavior of the potentials φ±

(ℓ,m) of

isolated (ℓ, m) modes (we may call this “modal linear stability”). In particular:

(ℓ,m) = ℜ eiωtχ−

• In [24] it was shown that separable solutions φ−
ω ∈ R, ruling out exponentially growing solutions in the odd sector.
• In [29] it was shown that separable solutions φ+
ω ∈ R, ruling out exponentially growing solutions in the even sector.
• In [23] it was shown that, for large t and ﬁxed r, φ±
• In [27], the conserved energy

(ℓ,m)(r) that do not diverge as r → ∞ require

(ℓ,m)(r) that do not diverge as r → ∞ require

(ℓ,m)(t, r) decays as t−(2ℓ+2) (an eﬀect known as “Price tails”).

was used to rule out uniform exponential growth in time.

• Also in [27], a point wise bound on the RW and Zerilli potentials was found in the form

|φ±

(ℓ,m), r > 2M, all t,

where the constants C ±

(ℓ,m) are given in terms of the initial data (φ±

(ℓ,m)(to, r), ∂tφ±

(ℓ,m)(to, r))

To understand the limitations of these results it is important to keep in mind that the φ±
(ℓ,m) are an inﬁnite set
of potentials deﬁned on the (t, r) orbit space M/SO(3), whose ﬁrst and second order derivatives φ±
(ℓ,m) enter the
terms in the series (11) through (14), together with ﬁrst and second derivatives of the spherical harmonics. Two
extra derivatives are required to calculate the perturbed Riemann tensor, as a ﬁrst step to measure the eﬀects of the
perturbation on the curvature. Thus, the relation of the potentials φ±
(ℓ,m) to geometrically meaningful quantities is
remote, and the usefulness of the bounds (16) to measure the strength of the perturbation is far from obvious.

5

A non-modal approach requires working with ﬁelds deﬁned on M, instead of M/SO(3). Bounds on such ﬁelds are
relevant if they are closely related to the eﬀects of the perturbation on the background geometry. As an example, the
ﬁeld

Φ = X(ℓ≥2,m)

φ(ℓ,m)

S(ℓ,m) : M → R

(17)

satisﬁes, as a consequence of the spherical harmonic equation and (RWE), a four dimensional version of the Regge-
Wheeler equation (see section II B 3) that is key in this work:

In the case Λ = 0 studied in [9], it was found that the use of this ﬁeld simpliﬁes the series (11) and (14) for the odd
terms to

(18)

an equation that gets us closer to a 4D formulation of the solution to the LEE. Still, Φ in (18) is merely a potential
for RW h−
αβ, the perturbed Riemann tensor contains up to fourth derivatives of Φ. Much more important is the fact,
also proved in [9], that the LEE implies that the ﬁeld r5 ˙Q− = r5G− also satisﬁes the 4DRWE, as this fact allowed us
to place a point wise bound on G− = ˙Q−.

The even sector of the LEE is more diﬃcult to approach. Is the simplicity of the RW potential (12), with the
obvious ℓ(ℓ + 1)/r2 term, what suggested considering the ﬁeld (17). The way that ℓ appears in (13), instead, is a
clear indication that there is no natural 4D interpretation of (ZE). A map exchanging solutions of the RWE and ZE
equations, found by Chandrasekhar [4], was what ultimately allowed us to reduce the entire LEE problem to the
study of the 4DRW equation in [9].

The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to extend the results in [9] to Schwarzschild black holes in cosmological
backgrounds, and (ii) to explain in detail a number of technicalities omitted in [9] due to the space limitations imposed
by the letter format.

We also show that for a speciﬁc Robin boundary condition at the time-like boundary of a Schwarzschild anti de
Sitter (SAdS) black hole there is an instability in the even sector. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been
noticed before. A systematic study of the gravitational linear stability of SAdS black holes for the diﬀerent possible
boundary conditions is currently being carried.

We have found that G± deﬁned in (8) are also suitable to describe perturbations around (A)dS Schwarzschild black
holes, as they are gauge invariant and the map (9) is injective also in these cases. In other words, (G+, G−) are
appropriate variables to study the most general gravitational linear perturbations of Schwarzschild (A)dS black holes.
The ℓ = 0, 1 pieces of these ﬁelds encode the relevant information on the stationary modes, which are perturbations
within the Kerr family (parametrized by mass M and the angular momenta components J (i), i = 1, 2, 3), whereas the
ℓ ≥ 2 terms encode the dynamics. More precisely:

• G− contains no ℓ = 0 term, time independent ℓ = 1 terms proportional to the ﬁrst order angular momenta

˙J (i), and a time dependent ℓ > 1 piece obeying the 4DRW equation.

components
• G+ contains no ℓ = 1 term, a time independent ℓ = 0 piece proportional to a mass shift ˙M , and a time dependent
ℓ > 1 piece which, for Λ ≥ 0, can be written in terms of ﬁelds obeying the 4DRW equation.

Once the appropriate set of perturbation ﬁelds (G+, G−) is given, and their relation to the 4DRW equation established
for Λ ≥ 0, we may adapt to the 4DRW equation the techniques used to prove boundedness of solutions of the scalar
wave equation, in order to analyze the behavior of the G± ﬁelds. As an example, the result of Kay and Wald [19]
was used in [9] to prove (10) in the Schwarzschild case, and is adapted here to prove that (10) holds also for positive
Λ. We can go further and take advantage of the growing literature on decay of solutions of the scalar wave equation
on S(A)dS backgrounds, as many of these results are expected to hold also for (4DRWE). Speciﬁc time decay results
for the 4DRW equation, somewhat expected from Price’s result [23], can be found in [1] (see also the recent preprint

[7]). Putting together the bijection (9), the above description of the stationary (ℓ = 0, 1) and dynamic (ℓ ≥ 2) pieces
of G±, and the time decay results, the following picture emerges for a perturbed Schwarzschild (SdS) black hole: a
generic perturbation contains a mass shift, inﬁnitesimal angular momenta j(i) and dynamical degrees of freedom; at
large times the dynamical degrees of freedom decay and what is left is a linearized Kerr (Kerr dS) black hole around
the background Schwarzschild (SdS) solution.

Through the paper, calculations are carried leaving Λ unspeciﬁed whenever possible, and specializing when neces-
sary. Among the many current treatments of linear perturbations of spherically symmetric spacetimes, we have made
extensive use of the excellent paper [5], which we found particularly well suited to our approach.

II. TENSOR FIELDS ON A SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SPACE-TIME

A spherically symmetric space-time is a warped product M = O ×r2 S2 of a Lorentzian two-manifold (O, ˜g) with

the unit sphere (S2,bg), for which we will use the standard angular coordinatesbgABdyAdyB = dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2:
The form of the metric (19) implies that (M, g) inherits the isometry group O(3) = SO(3) × P of (S2,bg) as an

isometry subgroup. Here SO(3) are the proper rotations and P is the antipodal map P (θ, φ) = (π − θ, φ + π). Since
SO(3) acts transitively on S2, O = M/SO(3), this is why (O, ˜g) is called the (SO(3)) orbit space.

gαβdzαdzβ = ˜gab(x)dxadxb + r2(x)bgAB(y)dyAdyB.

(19)

Equation (19) exhibits our index conventions, which we have adopted form ref [5]:

lower case Latin indexes are
used for tensors on O, upper case Latin indexes for tensors on S2, and Greek indexes for space-time tensors. We will
furthermore assume that

α = (a, A), β = (b, B), γ = (c, C), δ = (d, D), ...

(20)

Tensor ﬁelds introduced with a lower S2 index (say ZA) and then shown with an upper S2 index are assumed to

have been acted upon with the unit S2 metric inverse bgAB, (i.e., Z A ≡bgABZB), and similarly for upper S2 indexes
moving down. eDa, ˜ǫab and ˜gab are the covariant derivative, volume form (any chosen orientation) and metric inverse
for (O, ˜g); bDA andbǫAB are the covariant derivative and volume form on the unit sphere, for which we assume the
standard orientationbǫ = sin(θ)dθ ∧ dφ.
As an example, in terms of the diﬀerential operators eDa and bDA, the Laplacian on scalar ﬁelds reads

A. Covector and symmetric tensor ﬁelds

The Einstein ﬁeld equation, as well as its linearized version around a particular solution, is expressed as an equality
among symmetric tensor ﬁelds. The metric perturbation hαβ may be subjected to gauge transformations of the form
(5). This is why we are interested in the decomposition on a spherically symmetric spacetime of covector ﬁelds (such
as ζα) and symmetric rank two tensor ﬁelds such as hαβ.
We will assume all tensor ﬁelds on M are smooth. As a consequence their components will be square integrable on
S2 and can be expanded using a real orthonormal basis of scalar spherical harmonics

For a given covector ﬁeld ξα, the scalar ﬁelds X, Y : M → R are unique up to an S2-constant, thus they are unique
if we require that they belong to L2(S2)>0

a condition that we will assume. The symmetric tensor ﬁeld hαβ = hβα

contains two S2 covector ﬁelds

and a symmetric S2 tensor ﬁeld hAB. Note that qa and ha are covector ﬁelds on O parametrized on S2.
Using Proposition 2.2 in [18] and the fact that there are no transverse traceless symmetric tensor ﬁelds on S2 [16], we
ﬁnd that the S2 symmetric tensor hAB in (30) can be uniquely decomposed into three terms:

Introducing J = S2/r2, G = S1/r2 and k = L/r2 we arrive at (c.f., [5], Section IV.A)

The proof of the following lemma follows from straightforward calculation:

Lemma 2.

(i) The kernel of the map (ha, k) → h(−)

αβ deﬁned in (34) is the set of ha and k of the form

ha = ha(x), k = k1(x) + k2(x) cos(θ) + sin(θ) (k3(x) cos(φ) + k4(x) sin(φ)) ,

(36)

This implies that ha and k are unique if they are required to belong to L2(S2)>0 and L2(S2)>1 respectively:

ha = Xℓ≥1,m

(ii) The kernel of the map (hab, qa, J, G) → h(+)

αβ deﬁned in (35) is characterized by hab = 0, J = 0,

qa = qa(x), G = G1(x) + G2(x) cos(θ) + sin(θ) (G3(x) cos(φ) + G4(x) sin(φ)) ,

(38)

thus, the ﬁelds (hab, qa, J, G) are uniquely deﬁned if we require that qa ∈ L2(S2)>0 and G ∈ L2(S2)>1.

From now on we will assume the required conditions for uniqueness of k, J, G, ha, qa and hab.

B. The Schwarzschild (A)dS solution

The Schwarzschild / Schwarzschild (anti) de-Sitter (S(A)dS) is the only spherically symmetric solution of the

vacuum Einstein equation with a cosmological constant Λ:

The constant M is the mass of the solution, M = 0 in (46) gives the Minkowski (Λ = 0), de Sitter (Λ > 0) and anti
de Sitter (Λ < 0) spacetimes. M > 0 in (46) corresponds to a Schwarzschild black hole if Λ = 0, a Schwarzschild de
Sitter (SdS) black hole if Λ > 0 and Λ < (3M )−2, and a Schwarzschild anti de Sitter (SAdS) black hole if Λ < 0.

The Killing vector ﬁeld ka∂a = ∂/∂v is timelike in the open sets deﬁned by f > 0 and spacelike in the open sets
deﬁned by f < 0. The null hypersurfaces of constant positive r where f = 0 are the horizons, they cover the curvature
singularity at r = 0.

In any open set where f 6= 0 we may deﬁne a “tortoise” radial coordinate r∗ by

These black holes have a non-static region I deﬁned by 0 < r < rh and a static region II deﬁned by rh < r < ∞.

10

The SdS black holes are those for which 0 < Λ < (3M )−2 (f has single real root when Λ > (3M )−2, and this root is
+
negative). For SdS black holes f has one negative (ro) and two positive roots rh < rc, ro + rh + rc = 0, with rc → rh
as 9M 2Λ → 1−, and [20]

2M < rh < 3M < rc.

(52)

There is a non-static region I deﬁned by 0 < r < rh adjacent to a static region II (rh < r < rc), and a further
non-static region III deﬁned by r > rc.

This paper focuses on the stability of the static region II of Schwarzschild and S(A)dS black holes.

g is smooth in I ∪ II (i.e., 0 < r < rc for SdS, 0 < r for Schwarzschild and SAdS), since f is smooth with a simple
zero at r = rh and no zeros in I and II.
Consider the following solution of (47)

The black hole metric (46) in I′ ∪ II′ is again given by equation (58), except that now V < 0. It can be checked that
(58) is smooth on S2 times the open region of the (U, V ) plane deﬁned by K(−U V ) > 0 (0 < K(−U V ) < rc for SdS).
This region contains two copies of I and two copies of II. Since r is a function of the product U V , the metric (58) has
the discrete Z2 symmetry (U, V ) → (−U,−V ) under which I ↔ I′ and II ↔ II′. The Z2 invariant set U = V = 0 is a
sphere of radius rh, called bifurcation sphere.

It follows that, in region II of a Schwarzschild or SdS black hole, −∞ < r∗ < ∞ (which corresponds to the entire
quadrants U < 0, V > 0 and U > 0, V < 0). For SAdS, on the other hand, −∞ < r∗ < 0, therefore U > −1/V in II,
and U < −1/V in II′.

The above construction gives the Penrose-Carter diagrams in Figure 1. In the AdS case (right side of the ﬁgure),
there is a conformal time like boundary corresponding to U > −1/V in II, and U < −1/V in II′. The conformal
boundary of region II is replaced in the Schwarzschild case by null inﬁnity, and in the SdS case by the cosmological
horizon (left side of the ﬁgure). For the SdS black hole it is possible to follow a procedure similar to the one outlined
above that gives a further extension with a bifurcation sphere at r = rc, two copies of region III, and an extra copy
of II. The maximal analytic extension of SdS contains inﬁnitely many copies of I, II, and III [13].

and use this in equations (65)-(67), we ﬁnd that (4DRWE) is indeed equivalent to the set of equations (RWE),
extended to include ℓ = 0, 1.

Note that, although the above equations are formally similar for diﬀerent values of Λ, −∞ < r∗ < ∞ as r spans
region II of the Schwarzschild and SdS black holes, but is restricted to r∗ < 0 in region II of the SAdS black hole.
The reason why equation (4DRWE) for SAdS is equivalent to a system of wave equations with a potential in a half
of a two dimensional Minkowski space, is that region II of SAdS is not globally hyperbolic, but has the timelike
boundary at r∗ = 0 (equation (61)). The problem of deﬁning the dynamics imposed by hyperbolic equations (such
as (4DRWE), (RWE) and (ZE)) in a non globally hyperbolic static spacetime (either SAdS or its two dimensional
orbit space SAdS/SO(3)), that is, giving unique solutions from initial data at a surface Σo transverse to the timelike
Killing vector ka, has been addressed in the series of articles [28], [17] and [18]. The dynamics is unique only within
the domain of dependence of the support of the initial datum, as expected; outside it, it depends on the self adjoint
extension that we choose for the operator A (roughly, our choice of boundary conditions at the tilmelike boundary
r∗ = 0).

For the Zerilli equation (ZE), we have found that there is a choice of boundary conditions at r∗ = 0 of an SAdS
black hole under which even perturbations that preserve the AdS asymptote grow exponentially with time. For this
choice, SAdS is unstable. There is an inﬁnite set of possible boundary conditions for equation (ZE) in SAdS/SO(3),
we are currently analyzing the dynamics and stability of SAdS black holes under diﬀerent choices.

III. THE LINEARIZED EINSTEIN EQUATION: ODD SECTOR

There are many sources for the well know solution of the LEE around a Schwarzschild background. Two historically
relevant references are [21], where the gauge invariance of RW and Zerilli potentials was established, and [12], where a
“covariant” formulation, meaning, using arbitrary coordinates for the orbit space in order to study, e.g., waves crossing
the horizon (this should more properly be called “2D covariant approach”) was developed. We ﬁnd the 2D covariant
approach of reference [25] particularly well adjusted to our purposes as, although restricted to the dynamical ℓ ≥ 2
perturbations, avoids unnecessary expansions in harmonic modes. Section V in [25] is devoted to the Schwarzschild
black hole, we generalize this to Λ 6= 0 below.

A. Gauge transformations and gauge invariants

13

The eﬀect of the diﬀeomorphism generated by the vector ﬁeld ξα on the ﬁrst order variation of a tensor T is

˙T → ˙T + £ξT . In particular, the eﬀect on hαβ = ˙gαβ,

hαβ → £ξgαβ = hαβ + ∇αξβ + ∇βξα = h′

αβ,

deﬁnes an equivalence relation where hαβ ∼ h′
αβ iﬀ there exists a covector ﬁeld ξα such that (69) holds. To measure
the strength of the perturbation we will analyze gauge invariant ﬁelds, i.e., ﬁelds that depend only on the class [hαβ]
of a metric perturbation under the equivalence relation deﬁned above. In this section we show how to parametrize
the set of classes [hαβ] by means of gauge invariant ﬁelds and how to choose a class representative (gauge ﬁxing).

Given a generic vector ﬁeld (25)-(29) we ﬁnd that

where it should be kept in mind that X and Y belong to L2(S2)>0. These equations imply that the odd (even) piece

J = aM in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. This proves our previous assertion that ℓ = 1 odd modes correspond to
displacements within the stationary Kerr family of black holes.

Consider now the ℓ > 1 odd LEE, equations (83) and (84). For the Schwarzschild-(A)dS background equation (84)

reads

Eb = ˜ǫb

ceDc(r2F ) + (2 + bDAbDA)Hb = 0,

(89)

and, as noticed in [5], implies (83) (proof: 0 = eDbEb = (2 + bDAbDA)eDbHb implies eDbHb = 0 since Hb ∈ L2(S2)>1).
On the other hand, equation (89) implies (but is not equivalent to!) ˜ǫabeDa(r−2Eb) = 0, a condition that, from the

deﬁnition of F , equations (21) and (78) and the background equation

is seen to be equivalent to

We can gather our results concerning the odd sector of the LEE in the following:

Lemma 4. Consider the odd sector of the LEE around a Schwarzschild-(A)dS background:

(i) The solution of the ℓ > 1 piece of the metric perturbation in the Regge-Wheeler gauge is given by equation (74),
where the gauge invariant ﬁeld Ha is as in equation (93) and Φ satisﬁes the 4DRW equation (99). Equations
(74) and (93) are equivalent to (18).

(ii) The solution of the ℓ = 1 piece is given in equations (42) and (87). In this last equation j(m) are three gauge

invariant constants and Z (m) three arbitrary gauge functions.

(iii) There is a bijection between the space L− of smooth odd solutions of the LEE mod gauge transformations and

the set

L− = {j(m), m = 1, 2, 3} ∪ {Φ | Φ is a smooth solution of equation (99)}.

(iv) The LEE implies that the gauge invariant ﬁeld F = F1 + F (deﬁned in equations (78) and (79)) satisﬁes the

4DRW equation (92).

The equivalence of (74) and (93) to (18) is checked by a straightforward calculation. (iii) follows immediately from
(i) and (ii). Note also that the relation (97) explains why the ﬁelds F and Φ, which belong to L2(S2)>1, satisfy the

3 (cid:1) and [2 + bDAbDA] commute, and [2 + bDAbDA] is invertible in
same wave equation: the operators ∇α∇α +(cid:0) 8M
L2(S2)>1 (on scalar ﬁelds, bDAbDA = J2 and on arbitrary tensor ﬁelds [J2,∇α] = 0, since [£K,∇α] = 0 for any Killing

vector ﬁeld K α).

C. Measurable eﬀects of the perturbation on the geometry

For the purposes of a non-modal analysis, Lemma 4.(iii) oﬀers a more appropriate parametrization of the dynamical
sector of the odd perturbations than the inﬁnite set of φ−
(ℓ,m)’s. However, unlike the ℓ = 1 parameters j(m), no clear
geometrical meaning can be attached to Φ in (99), beyond that of being a potential for solutions of the LEE, equation
In this section we show that the ﬁrst order variation G− = ˙Q− of
(18). Consider now the curvature scalar (7).
Q− associated to a perturbation [h(−)
αβ . In particular, Φ
and the j(m)can be recovered from G− = ˙Q− which, unlike Φ, has a distinct geometrical meaning. Note that, since
Q− = 0 for the S(A)dS geometries,

αβ ] ∈ L− contains all the gauge invariant information on h(−)
˙Q− is gauge invariant.

˙Q− can be obtained from the set of equations (3) and (29) in [5]. The calculations are tedious and not particularly

illuminating. The result is

(i) Equation (103) proves that ˙Q− ∈ L2(S2)>0. This is a consequence of the facts that there are no odd ℓ = 0 modes,
αβ ](cid:17). Alternatively, by Birkhoﬀ’s theorem in
only odd modes contribute to ˙Q−, and J2 ˙Q−(cid:16)[h(−)

a cosmological background [26], the only possible spherically symmetric perturbation of a Schwarzschild-(A)dS
black hole amounts to a change of the black hole mass, and this does not aﬀect the unperturbed value Q− = 0.
Since J2 commutes with the wave operator in (92), it follows from (100) and Lemma 4.(iv) that r5 ˙Q− satisﬁes
(104).

J2(J2 + 2) (equation (103)). This operator is invertible in L2(S2)>1, so we can recover Φ from ˙Q−(cid:16)[h(−)

use it in (93) or (18) to construct the Regge-Wheeler representative (74) of the ℓ > 1 piece of [h(−)

explain why all these ﬁelds obey the same way equation. Note that the addition of an ℓ = 1 piece Φ(ℓ=1) to the potential

Φ satisfying a 4DRW equation would be irrelevant, as its contribution to Ha would vanish: ˜ǫabeDb(r2Φ(ℓ=1)) = 0.

D. Nonmodal linear stability of the Λ ≥ 0 black holes

Having found a scalar gauge invariant ﬁeld (G− = ˙Q−) that measures the distortion of the curvature and encodes all
the information on a given odd perturbation, it is natural to deﬁne the strength of the perturbation as the magnitude
˙Q−: the fact r5 ˙Q− satisﬁes equation (4DRWE) (see (104)
of this ﬁeld. This is possible thanks to another feature of
in Theorem 1.(i))). It is important to note that Theorem 1 applies to arbitrary smooth perturbations, whereas any
boundedness or fall-oﬀ condition will certainly require restricting to perturbations evolving from data that behave
properly for r → ∞ (r → rc if Λ > 0).

1. The asymptotically ﬂat case

In the Λ = 0 case, a simple point wise boundedness statement for G− = ˙Q− can be made by noting that the proof

of boundedness of a Klein Gordon ﬁeld in [19] holds for the 4DRW equation:

Theorem 2. For any smooth solution of the odd LEE which has compact support on Cauchy surfaces of the
Kruskal extension I ∪ II ∪ I′ ∪ II′ of the Schwarzschild space-time (Figure 1), there exists a constant K− such that
|G−| < K− r−6 for r > 2M .

Proof. From (103), | ˙Q−| ≤ C/r7 + |r5 ˙Q>1|/r5, where C > 0 is a constant that depends on the j(m)’s and the ﬁeld
r5 ˙Q>1 satisﬁes the 4DRW equation (99), so we only need concentrate on this ﬁeld. The similarities between the
4DRWE equation and the massive Klein Gordon equation dealt with in [19] allow us to proceed by adapting the proof
of Theorem 1 in [19]. The Z2 symmetry arguments in [19] showing that this theorem reduces to the intermediate case
(treated in the appendix in [19]) apply verbatim to equation (99). The intermediate case is deﬁned by adding the
requirements that r5 ˙Q and its T derivative (in coordinates (T, X, θ, φ), where T = (U + V )/2 and X = (V − U )/2)
vanish on the bifurcation sphere (refer to Section II B 2). There remains to check that the proof in the appendix in
[19] applies to the wave equation (99). To this end, we use (64)-(67) to cast (104) in the exterior Kruskal wedge as

where m2 is the square of the mass of the Klein Gordon ﬁeld (which appears with a wrong sign in equation (1) in
[19], but with the correct sign in the equations in the appendix). However, the proof in the appendix in [19] does
not make use of the explicit forms of V KG
, but only on the facts that these functions are bounded on
the exterior wedge r ≥ 2M , and that A is a positive deﬁnite self adjoint operator on L2(R × S2, dr∗ sin θ dθ dφ).
Since V1 and V2 deﬁned in (109)-(110) are bounded for r > 2M , and A is positive deﬁnite on the ℓ > 1 subspace
of L2(R × S2, dx sin θ dθ dφ), the proof in the appendix in [19] applies to the wave equation (104) for r5 ˙Q>1
− . The
intermediate case then follows, and so the analogous of Theorem 1 in [19]. Note that the proof in [19] shows that for
the Klein Gordon ﬁeld |ΦKG| < C/r holds on the domain of outer communications. Although the weaker statement
|ΦKG| < C has been made in [19], the stronger form was used in this proof.

2. The asymptotically de Sitter case

Two key similarities between the extension (58) for Λ 6= 0 and the Kruskal extension of the Λ = 0 Schwarzschild
black hole (refer to Section II B 2 and Figure 1) are: i) the Z2 isometry exchanging I and I′ and II and II′, and ii) the
fact that rh is a simple root of f , which implies that the asymptotic behavior of ﬁelds vanishing at the bifurcation
sphere is that in equation (A1) in [19]. This allows us to prove the following

Theorem 3. For any smooth solution of the odd LEE which has compact support on Cauchy surfaces of the extended
I ∪ II ∪ I′ ∪ II′ SdS black hole, there exists a constant K− such that |G−| < K− r−6 (equivalently, |G−| < a constant)
for rh < r < rc.

Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 2, and in view of the above comments, we need only prove the intermediate case
for r5 ˙Q>1. This ﬁeld obeys the equation

In Schwarschild coordinates (t, r) the residual gauge freedom (120) implies that z(t, r) is deﬁned up to an arbitrary
additive function x(r) (choose x′ = rf Z ′′ to match (120)). Replacing (143) in (129) and (131) we ﬁnd that,working in
(t, r) coordinates, z(t, r) = At + B(r). This gives htt = A/r, hrr = (2A/r)/f 2 and htr = B′(r)/r. Choosing the gauge
B(r) = 0 we recognize this perturbation as a shift M → M + A/2 in the mass treated to ﬁrst order in A/2 = ˙M .
This was to be expected from Birkhoﬀ’s theorem. In conclusion, we can choose a gauge such that

that the even ℓ = 1 sector is void.

C. Solution of the linearized Einstein equation

The results of the previous section are gathered in the following

Lemma 5. The LEE (1) in the even sector is equivalent to the system of equations (138)-(142) and (144).

The system (139)-(142) of LEE for the ℓ > 1 sector was ﬁrst solved by Zerilli in [29], the addition of a cosmological
constant was considered in [15]. In this section we generalize to the case Λ 6= 0 the derivation in [5] of the Zerilli
equation.
Equation (139) implies that there is a scalar ﬁeld ζ : M → R, deﬁned up to an additive function z : S2 → R,
ζ = ζo + z, such that

Za = eDaζ.

is introduced to eliminate ﬁrst derivatives from (149) and reduce it to a two dimensional wave equation:

This is the Zerilli equation, ﬁrst obtained for Λ = 0 in [29], and generalized to Schwarzschild-(A)dS in [15]. The

non-local operator (bDBbDB + 2 − 6M/r)−2 is well deﬁned on L2(S2)>1; the Zerilli equation was derived within the

context of a modal approach to the problem, in which Ψ is expanded in spherical harmonics

Ψ = X(ℓ,m)

From the ζ ﬁeld (and therefore from the Zerilli ﬁeld) it is possible to reconstruct Hab and J by tracing back the above

D. The ubiquitous Regge-Wheeler equation

Let us consider the ﬁeld [5]

which is the Regge-Wheeler equation (99)! We have found a scalar ﬁeld Φ, related to the even metric perturbation
potential ζ through (157), that satisﬁes the fundamental equation to which the odd LEE reduce.

Replacing eDbeDbζ with −Φ/r in (149) gives the following relation between ζ and Φ:

h12M (eDar) eDa − (bDCbDC + 2)(bDCbDC )i ζ =(cid:20) 6M

r − (bDCbDC + 2)(cid:21) (rΦ).

Since ζ (or Ψ) contains all the information on equivalence classes of ℓ > 1 solutions of the even LEE, but does not admit
a four dimensional translation, whereas Φ satisﬁes the 4DRW equation, one is tempted to treat even perturbations
in terms of Φ, using the relationship (159). This possibility was disregarded in [5] due to the fact that the operator
on the left hand side in (159) has a non trivial kernel, suggesting that information is lost in switching from ζ to Φ.
There is, however, a loophole in this argument, as we now proceed to explain:
Expand Φ and ζ in spherical harmonics,

and that the second term will be bounded for ﬁxed t as r → ∞. For metric perturbations that do not diverge
as r → ∞, the only consistent possible choice is F∞(t) = 0, otherwise the ℓ pieces of J and Hab would diverge
as ewℓr times a rational function of r (see (155)-(156)). We conclude that the asymptotic condition as r → ∞

If we used ro < ∞ in (163), the non-trivial function Fro (t) could be obtained by requiring that (163) be a solution

According to Theorem 3, the φ(ℓ,m) in (161) are bounded for rh < r < rc (−∞ < r∗ < ∞). This implies that
we can take ro → rc (r∗
o → ∞) in (169), and the resulting term involving the integral will be bounded for ﬁxed
t as r → rc. For metric perturbations that do not diverge as r → rc, the only consistent choice is Frc(t) = 0.
Otherwise the ℓ pieces of J and Hab would diverge as ewℓr∗

as r → rc.

We have proved the following

Lemma 6. Consider the even sector of the LEE around a Schwarzschild-(A)dS background:

(i) The solution of the ℓ = 0 piece of the metric perturbation in a particular gauge is given by equations (118),

(119) and (144).

(ii) The ℓ = 1 sector of the LEE is trivial.

(iii) The solution of the ℓ > 1 sector is given in equations (99), (160), (166)/(169) and (155)-(156).
(iv) There is a bijection between the space L+ of smooth odd solutions of the LEE mod gauge transformations, and

the set

L+ = { ˙M} ∪ {Φ | Φ is a smooth solution of equation (99)}.

(v) There is a bijection between L+ and the set

Lφ
+ = { ˙M} ∪ {φ+

(ℓ,m), m, ℓ ≥ 2 | φ+

(ℓ,m) is a smooth solution of equation (153)}.

We gather Lemma 4.iii and Lemma 6.iv in

Theorem 4. There is a bijection between the space L of smooth solutions of the LEE mod gauge transformations and
the set

L = { ˙M , j(m), m = 1, 2, 3} ∪ {(Φ−, Φ+) | Φ± smooth solutions of equation (99)}.

(170)

The dynamical perturbations are parametrized by the two solutions Φ± of the 4DRW equation (99), and correspond to
˙M (ℓ = 0)
ℓ ≥ 2 perturbations. The stationary perturbations are parametrized by the ﬁrst order variation of the mass
and the angular momenta components j(m), m = 1, 2, 3 (ℓ = 1), these correspond to perturbations within the Kerr/
Kerr-(A)dS family.

E. Chandrasekhar’s duality

The modal approach to the linear perturbation problem is based on analyzing the evolution of isolated (ℓ, m) modes
using the Zerilli and Regge-Wheeler equations (ZE) and (RWE) respectively. In (t, r) coordinates, these equations
are separable, there are solutions of the form

SAdS is unstable under dynamics that allow this boundary condition for some ℓ. A systematic study of stability as a
function of α is being carried out [30].

Note that there is a similarity between SAdS and the negative mass Schwarzschild solution, for which we may

choose r∗ = 0 at r = 0 and

(197)
will grow monotonically with 0 < r∗ < ∞. The similarity with SAdS is that r∗ is restricted to a half-line. This allows
to consider the Chandrasekhar mode

(ℓ,m) = χ+

(ℓ + 2)(ℓ − 1)r + 6M
as a possible solution of (ZE), as it belongs for every t to the relevant space L2(R+
r∗, dr∗) (note that wℓ < 0 if M < 0).
This solution grows exponentially in time, so it signals an instability. There is a key diﬀerence, however, between
the timelike boundary at r = 0 of the negative mass Schwarzschild solution and the conformal timelike boundary at
r = ∞ of SAdS, as for the former there is a unique boundary condition that makes the linear perturbation scheme
self-consistent, by no worsening the degree of the pole of the unperturbed curvature scalars [14] [10]. The solution
(198) of (ZE) satisﬁes precisely this boundary condition. This was used in [14] [10] to prove the instability of the
Schwarzschild naked singularity.

are all solutions of (4DRWE), and therefore so is ∂2
t Φ5. Note that the expression (215) for G+, written entirely in
terms of solutions of (4DRWE), is possible thanks to the cancellation in (213) of the ((ℓ+2)(ℓ−1)r+6M ) denominators
in Zℓ and Wℓ.

Theorem 6.

(i) For any smooth solution of the even LEE which has compact support on Cauchy surfaces of the Kruskal extension
I ∪ II ∪ I′ ∪ II′ of the Schwarzschild space-time, there exists a constant K+ such that |G+| < K+ r−3 for r > 2M .
(ii) For any mooth solution of the even LEE which has compact support on Cauchy surfaces of region I ∪ II ∪ I′ ∪ II′
of the extended SdS black hole, there exists a constant K+ such that |G+| < K+ r−3 (equivalently |G+| < some
constant) for rh < r < rc.

Proof. According to Theorems 2 and 3, solutions of (4DRWE) are bounded on region II of both Schwarzschild and
SdS black holes. This implies that the ﬁrst two terms in (215) are bounded by a constant times r−3, so the theorem
follows if ∂r∗Φ is pointwise bounded for Φ a solution of (4DRWE). That this is the case, follows by adapting the proof
in section 3.6 in [8] of the pointwiese boundedness of ∂r∗ΦKG on the static region of an extreme Reissner-Nordstr¨om
black hole, ΦKG a solution of the Klein-Gordon equation (note that the tortoise coordinate r∗ is denoted s in [8]).
That this is possible follows from the following facts: Equations (13) and (14) in [8] are formally identical to the
4DRWE in its form (108)-(109), and (112)-(113), and the potentials Vj and V Λ
j are bounded and nonzero in region
II, where A and AΛ are positive.

which, in view of the bijection (9), corresponds to a linearized Kerr (Kerr de Sitter) black hole around the Schwarzschild
(SdS) background. The picture that emerges from these considerations is that, for a generic perturbation, the black
hole ends up settling into a slowly rotating Kerr (Kerr dS) black hole. To make statements like these more precise,
all we need is quantitative information on the decay of solutions of the 4DRW equation. This is so because r5G− is
a solution of this equation, and G+ can be written entirely in terms of solutions of the 4DRW equation (see equation
(215)). Alternatively, in view of Theorem 4, there is a bijection between solutions of the LEE and a set containing the
˙M , j(m) and two ﬁelds Φ± that obey the 4DRW equation. The perturbed metric is linearized Kerr (Kerr
constants
de Sitter) if Φ± = 0, which is the limit approached at large t. Quantitative results for the decay in time of solutions
of the 4DRW equation can be found in [1], [11] and more recently in [7] (in this last reference, as statements on a
symmetric tensor ﬁeld made out of two scalar ﬁelds obeying (4DRWE)).

32

B. Reduction of the LEE to the 4DRW equation

A natural question that arises from our results is: can we forget altogether metric perturbations and restrict
ourselves to the study of the 4DRW equation? The answer to this question is in the aﬃrmative (Theorem 4 and
equations (103) and (215)), although some technical issues should be mentioned if one intends to study perturbations
using only the G± or similar perturbed curvature ﬁelds. One is related to the possibility of evolving perturbations from
initial G± data. Since r5G− obeys the 4DRW equation, initial data (e.g., ∂tG− and G− restricted to a t =constant
hypersurface) gives G− and, by expanding in spherical harmonics, the metric perturbation in the RW gauge uniquely
related to it. This does not happen, however, with G+ in the even sector. Since the operator f ∂r + Zℓ in (204) has
a non trivial kernel, and G+ does not satisfy a wave equation (which would allow us to recover the lost information
by proceeding as in Section IV E), the set of ∂tφ+
(ℓ,m) at t = to cannot be obtained from ∂tG+ and G+
at t = to. The reason why G+ does not obey a wave equation is, of course, that is made out of the perturbation
of curvature scalars involving both the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivative; the possibility of constructing
a gauge invariant curvature scalar ﬁeld for the even sector that does not use derivatives of the Riemann tensor was
ruled out in [9].
We should mention, however, two alternatives to the use of G+ (or similar ﬁelds involving CSs). One is using the
potentials Φ± in Theorem 4: perturbations are entirely characterized by ˙M , j(m) (stationary perturbations) and the
ﬁelds Φ± obeying the 4DRW equation (dynamical perturbations). This shows that we can do without the Zerilli
equation and that the LEE does reduce to the 4DRW equation. The other possibility to avoid scalar ﬁelds involving
higher metric derivatives (such as ˙X in G+, equation (202)), is constructing gauge invariant combinations made out
of perturbed curvature scalars and the metric perturbation. We close this section by exhibiting an example of such a
construction: if we calculate the (gauge dependent) scalar ﬁeld ˙Q+ (see (7)) in the RW gauge, we ﬁnd that

thus r5 ˙Q(RW )
+,>1 also satisﬁes the 4DRW equation! We might think of using ˙Q+ to measure the strength of even
perturbations, but this ﬁeld is gauge dependent due to the fact that Q+ 6= 0 for the background Schwarzschild or
S(A)dS black hole. Under the gauge transformation (69),

˙Q+ → ˙Q+

′ = ˙Q+ + ζr∂rQ+ = ˙Q+ − ζr 6M 2
r7 .

(221)

This suggests searching for a gauge invariant ﬁeld H+ that agrees with ˙Q+ in the RW gauge. If we compare (221)
with equation (125), we ﬁnd the following solution:

Since this gauge invariant ﬁeld reduces in the RW gauge to ˙Q(RW )

, and the φ+

(ℓ,m) are gauge invariant,

H+ =

(223)

Note that the dynamical ℓ ≥ 2 piece of r5H+ satisﬁes the 4DRW equation, which gives H+ an advantage over G+:
it is possible to obtain H+ from the initial datum (r5H+, r5∂tH+)|to . Once this is done, the corresponding metric
˙M and the
perturbation in the RW gauge can be obtained by expanding H+ in spherical harmonics, which gives us
ℓ φ+
D−
(ℓ,m). Although the H+ looks more geometrical than
the potentials Φ± in Theorem 4, we have not found an obvious interpretation for this ﬁeld.
