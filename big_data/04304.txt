ABSTRACT

Pulsar glitches, sudden jumps in frequency observed in many radio pulsars, may
be the macroscopic manifestation of superﬂuid vortex avalanches on the microscopic
scale. Small scale quantum mechanical simulations of vortex motion in a decelerating
container have shown that such events are possible and predict power-law distribu-
tions for the size of the events, and exponential distributions for the waiting time.
Despite a paucity of data, this prediction is consistent with the size and waiting time
distributions of most glitching pulsars. Nevertheless a few object appear to glitch
quasi-periodically, and exhibit many large glitches, while a recent study of the Crab
pulsar has suggested a cut-oﬀ deviations from a power-law distribution for smaller
glitches (Espinoza et al. 2014). In this paper we incorporate the results of quantum
mechanical simulations in a macroscopic scale superﬂuid hydrodynamics simulation.
We show that the eﬀect of vortex coupling to the neutron and proton ﬂuids in the
neutron star naturally leads to deviations from power-law distributions for sizes and
from exponential distributions for waiting times. In particular we predict a cut-oﬀ in
the size distribution for small glitches.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rotation rate of radio pulsars, rotating magnetised Neu-
tron Stars (NSs), is exquisitely stable, in some cases rivalling
the stability of atomic clocks. However some pulsars un-
dergo sudden jumps in frequency, known as ‘glitches’, that
are instantaneous to the accuracy of the data. The origin
of these events is still debated forty years after their ﬁrst
discovery, but it is generally thought that they are due to a
large scale superﬂuid component in the NS interior that is
only weakly coupled to the ‘normal’ component of the star
which is tracked by the radio signal. On theoretical grounds
neutrons are expected to be superﬂuid, as a mature NS is
likely to be cold enough for most regions in the interior to
be below the superﬂuid transition temperature (Baym et al.
1969). Superﬂuidity has a strong impact on the dynamics of
the system, as a superﬂuid rotates by forming an array of
quantised vortices, which mediate a dissipative interaction
between the superﬂuid and the normal ﬂuid; the mutual
friction. Vortices, however, can also be strongly attracted,
or ‘pinned’, to ions in the crust (Alpar 1977) or supercon-
ducting ﬂux tubes in the core of the star (Link 2003). In
this case the superﬂuid cannot expel vorticity and cannot
spin down together with the normal component, thus lag-
ging behind and storing angular momentum. The sudden

c(cid:13) 2014 RAS

re-coupling of the two components leads to an exchange of
angular momentum and a glitch, as was suggested early on
by Anderson & Itoh (1975).

Despite the success of this paradigm in explaining many
qualitative features of pulsar glitches, and the bulk of work
that has been devoted to studying the response of the star
to a glitch (see Haskell & Melatos (2015a) for a review), it
is still unclear what triggers such an event. Several mech-
anisms have been suggested, including starquakes (Ruder-
man 1969), superﬂuid instabilities (Andersson et al. 2003)
and vortex avalanches (Cheng et al. 1988; Melatos et al.
2008). This last mechanism is based on the idea that vor-
tices in a NS may form a Self Organised Critical (SOC)
system, in which global stresses, due to classical drag forces
acting on pinned vortices, are relieved locally via discrete
avalanches, so that the system self-regulates and is always
close to the critical threshold for unpinning (Warszawski &
Melatos 2008; Warszawski et al. 2012). As a consequence of
self organised criticality, the distribution of glitch sizes in
a pulsar is expected to be a power law and the distribu-
tion of waiting times an exponential. This is approximately
true for many glitching pulsars (Melatos et al. 2008), al-
though the small number of events does not allow for strong
statistical conclusions. There are, however, at least three

2

B.Haskell

pulsars, the best known example being the Vela pulsar,
which appear to mostly have glitches of a typical size which
occur quasi-periodically (Melatos et al. 2008, 2015). This
behaviour is more reminiscent of the so-called ‘snowplow’
mechanism (Pizzochero 2011), in which the global reservoir
of angular momentum is depleted periodically once vortices
can no longer be held in place by the pinning force. The pe-
riodicity and size of Vela glitches can be well reproduced in
this framework, as the system has a natural length-scale and
time-scale set by the height and position of the maximum of
the microphysical pinning force. Additionally, a recent anal-
ysis of glitches in the Crab pulsar suggests that there may
be a deviation from a power law distribution for the sizes,
and that glitches may have a substantial minimum size (Es-
pinoza et al. 2014).

In this paper we investigate how local, small scale, dis-
tributions of unpinning events are aﬀected by large scale hy-
drodynamics and coupling between the ﬂuids. In particular
we will show that even if unpinning events are distributed
as a power-laws on a microscopic level, the large scale glitch
distribution can be substantially diﬀerent, and exhibit a cut-
oﬀ for small glitch sizes.

2 METHODS

We model the NS as a two-ﬂuid system of superﬂuid neu-
trons and a charge neutral component consisting of the crust
and electromagnetically bound protons and electrons. We
thus do not consider vortex motion directly, but rather av-
erage over many vortices to consider the macroscopic motion
of two dynamical degrees of freedom. Following Andersson
& Comer (2006) we can write conservation laws for each
species x:

∂tρx + ∇i(ρxvi

x) = 0,

(1)

(∂t + vx

i + εxwyx

j ∇j)(vx

where ρx is the density of constituent x (with x = n for
superﬂuid neutrons and x = p for the locked proton,electron
and crust ﬂuid). The Euler equations are:
i ) +∇i(˜µx + Φ) + εxwj

i /ρx,
(2)
where we assume sums over repeated spacial indices, wyx
i =
i − vx
vy
i , εx is the entrainment parameter, Φ is the gravita-
tional potential and ˜µx = µx/mx is the chemical potential
per unit mass (and we will assume mp = mn). Finally f x
is
i
the mutual friction force, which for straight vortices takes
the form:

j = f x

i = γκnvρnB(cid:48)
f x

ijk ˆΩj

xy +γκnvρnBijk ˆΩj

nklm ˆΩn

l wxy

m , (3)

with Ωj the angular frequency of the neutron ﬂuid and κ =
h/2mn the quantum of circulation. For the vortex number
per unit area nv one has the relation:
κnv = 2 [Ωn + εn(Ωp − Ωn)] + ˜r∂˜r [Ωn + εn(Ωp − Ωn)] (4)

where ˜r is the cylindrical radius and γ < 1 represents the
fraction of vortices which are free (Jahan-Miri 2006), with
the remaining vortices pinned. The strength of the mutual
friction is parametrised by the dimensionless constants B
and B(cid:48)

.

Following Haskell et al. (2012) we consider the two com-
ponents to be rotating around the same axis deﬁned by ˆΩp,

and assume that the proton ﬂuid is rigidly rotating on the
timescales of interest. This assumption is justiﬁed on longer
post-glitch timescales, on which the crust can be considered
as a solid and the magnetic ﬁeld of the star will lock it
to the protons in the core. On shorter timescales, however,
several modes of oscillation of the ﬂuids could be present
(Sidery et al. 2010; van Eysden 2014), and are neglected in
the current treatment. The equations of motion, averaged
over vortex length (assuming straight vortices aligned with
the z axis), take the form:
˙Ωp = − ˙ΩO +

˙Ωn = − ˜Q(˜r)

ρn
where we have deﬁned ˜Q(˜r) = ρnγκnvB(Ωp − Ωn) and ˙ΩO
is the contribution to the spin evolution from the external
spin down torque acting on the star. In the following we take
g(εn) = 0. This is not accurate in the crust, as entrainment
will be strong and reduce the amount of angular momentum
available for a glitch (Chamel 2012, 2013; ?). For our pur-
poses this is, however, simply a rescaling of the allowed size
of glitches, and as we are interested in distributions and not
in ﬁtting absolute sizes, we will neglect this term for com-
putational ease. We have also included the contribution due
to pinning, ˜Fp, which we deﬁne as:

1

˜Q(˜r)
ρn

dV for Ωn − Ωp < ∆c

1 − εn − εp

˜Fp =
˜Fp = 0 for Ωn − Ωp (cid:62) ∆c
where ∆c is the critical lag for unpinning, and must be de-
termined from microphysical calculations of pinning forces.
We approximate the realistic results of Seveso et al. (2016)
by taking a Gaussian proﬁle of the form:

(7)

(8)

(cid:18)

− (˜r − rm)2

(cid:19)

∆c(˜r) = ∆M exp

∆c(˜r) =

∆min − τ ˙ΩO

Rc − Ri

+ ∆min for Rc < ˜r

2σ2
(˜r − Ri) + τ ˙ΩO for Ri < ˜r (cid:54) Rc (10)

(9)

where rm is the location of the maximum, which we take
to be at ρ = 7 × 1013 g/cm3, and we take as typical values
∆M = 10−2, ∆min = 2 × 10−4 and σ = 10−2(rm − Rc).
We model the equation of state as an n = 1 polytrope. The
timescale τ is the minimal coupling timescale that we resolve
in our numerical formulation, which we ﬁx as τ = 60s, to
approximate the observational upper limits on the rise time
of a glitch (Dodson et al. 2007). The external boundary of
our simulations Rnd is the neutron drip radius and Rc is the
the radius of the crust-core interface (taken at ρ = 1.6×1014
g/cm3). Ri is the internal boundary, which we take to be the
radius at which τM F = τ , with τM F = 1/(2Ωn < B >), with
< B > the standard mutual friction coeﬃcient for electron-
vortex scattering from Andersson et al. (2006), averaged
over the vortex length (Haskell et al. 2012). The moment of
inertia Ip in equations (5)-(6) is thus the combined moment
of inertia of the outer crust, protons in the computational
domain, and all components for ˜r (cid:54) Ri.
Finally, we ﬁx the initial value of γB over the computa-
tional domain to γB = ˙ΩO/2Ωn∆c, which ensures that the
neutrons are spinning down together with the proton ﬂuid,
with a ﬁxed lag close to the critical lag. This not only makes

c(cid:13) 2014 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–5

certain that the system is sub-critical from the start, but
also allows us to circumvent the substantial uncertainties in
microphysical estimates of B in the crust.

2.1 Random unpinning and avalanches

Evolving the system of equations in (5)-(6), as described in
the previous section, will not lead to glitches. An unpinning
trigger has to be added to initiate a glitch. Haskell et al.
(2012) followed the so-called ‘snowplow’ model (Pizzochero
2011) and assumed that a vortex sheet forms close to the
maximum of the critical lag ∆c. Once said lag is exceeded
vortices are free to move out, leading to an increase in B
(assumed to be due to Kelvin waves being excited by rapid
vortex motion) and a glitch. This mechanism predicts well
the sizes and waiting-times of the Vela and other pulsars
that exhibit mainly giant glitches, however it cannot ex-
plain why the sizes of glitches in many other pulsars span
several decades and are consistent with a power-law distri-
bution (Melatos et al. 2008). On the other hand quantum
mechanical Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) simulations of pinned vor-
tices in a decelerating trap show that vortex avalanches can
lead to glitches and naturally give rise to power-law distri-
butions for their sizes (Warszawski & Melatos 2011). In this
paper we take a ﬁrst step towards reconciling these two ap-
proaches by taking the large scale two-ﬂuid hydrodynamical
NS model described in the previous section as a background
over which to evolve small scale ﬂuctuations in the number
of pinned vortices, as predicted by GP simulations.

In practice we will follow the approach of Haskell &
Antonopoulou (2014) and assume that vortex avalanches can
randomly unpin vortices, increasing the unpinned fraction
from γ to αγ in a region Rnd − Rav < r < Rnd, where both
α and Rav are drawn from a power law distribution of the
form

(11)

p(x) =

(k − 1)xk
M − xk+1
xk+1

m

where x = Rav, α; the power-law index is k, and xm =
1, xM = 106. We also assume that waiting times t between
events are exponentially distributed:

p(t) =

exp (−t/tw)

1
tw

(12)

with tw the mean waiting time between unpinning events,
which we stress is not necessarily the mean waiting time
between observed glitches.
We thus draw a value α > 1 for the region Rnd − Rav <
r < Rnd, and the increased coupling leads to a ‘glitch’, al-
though for small values of α, the event is slow enough and
weak enough that it will not appear as a sudden jump in
frequency, but as a gradual increase of the spin-down rate.
Following the results of Haskell & Melatos (2015b) we
assume that vortices can repin if the lag Ωn − Ωp (cid:54) 0.98∆C .
In practice once the lag has been reduced below this limit,
we set γ = 0, until the lag increases again to Ωn − Ωp = ∆C ,
when we set once again γ = 1.

Let us note that before running the hydrodynamical
simulations we have veriﬁed that simply drawing Rav from
the distribution in (11) and transferring the angular momen-
tum of the superﬂuid in the region Rnd − Rav < r < Rnd to
the crust leads to a power-law distribution for the glitches for

Figure 1. Probability distribution function for glitch sizes
∆Ωp/Ωp for a model with microscopic power-law index k = −1.05
and waiting time tw = 0.1 days. The probability distribution
function is estimated both with a histogram and a gaussian kernel
density estimator. The distribution deviates signiﬁcantly from a
power law at lower sizes, with a notable absence of small glitches.
This is due to the fact that very small events do not appear
as sudden jumps, i.e. glitches, but rather as gradual changes in
the spin-down rate (i.e. timing noise) and are not ﬂagged by our
glitch-ﬁnding algorithm.

which we recover the original microphysical index k, and the
smallest glitch size we can resolve is ∆Ωp/Ωp = 8.7× 10−14.

3 RESULTS

We have run a number of simulations, each comprising ap-
proximately 100 glitches, with varying ∆C , mass M , mean
waiting time tw and power-law index k and analysed the re-
sults. After running the simulations we run a simple glitch
ﬁnding algorithm, that identiﬁes all events in which the spin
˙Ωp > 0, and measures
frequency of the ’crust’ Ωp rises, i.e.
the maximum size of the event from the start of the rise
to the maximum of the frequency. The main conclusion is
that, independently of the choice of parameters, the macro-
scopic glitch size and waiting time distributions that we ex-
tract from the simulation diﬀer signiﬁcantly from our micro-
physical inputs. For all cases size distributions deviate from
power-law distributions at the lower end, with a strong drop
oﬀ in the number of glitches for smaller sizes, as can be seen
from the examples in ﬁgures 1 and 2. This is due to the fact
that for small values of α, the eﬀective mutual friction pa-
rameter γB is small, leading to a slow, more gradual event
that also exchanges a small amount of angular momentum,
due to the low value of Rav. This event is thus a gradual
change in the spin-down rate, more similar to timing-noise,
and is not identiﬁed as a glitch by our glitch ﬁnding algo-
rithm. An example of such an event is shown in ﬁgure 3.

This is consistent with observations of glitches in the
Crab pulsar, which reveal deviations of the size distri-
bution from a power-law with a lack of observed small
glitches(Espinoza et al. 2014). Our results show that the ef-
fect of superﬂuid hydrodynamics are sizeable and lead to

Figure 2. Probability distribution function for glitch sizes
∆Ωp/Ωp for a model with microscopic power-law index k = −1.5
and waiting time tw = 0.1 days. The probability distribution
function is estimated both with a histogram and a gaussian ker-
nel density estimator. As in the previous case with k = −1.05 the
distribution deviates signiﬁcantly from a power law at the lower
end, but there is also an excess of large glitches.

Figure 3. Example of a spin down curve obtained from a sim-
ulation with k = −1.05, tw = 1 day (thick red line), compared
to a linear ﬁt to the spin down from previous data (dashed blue
line). Two events are notable, event (a) which corresponds to a
slow decrease of the spin down rate, and is not detected by the
glitch ﬁnder, and event (b), which is a standard glitch.

deviations from power law distributions, even though on
a microphysical scale vortex unpinning events may still be
power-law distributed.
Figures 1 and 2 also reveal that a steeper power-law
with index k = −1.5, rather than k = −1.05, on the micro-
physical level leads to a macroscopic distribution of glitch
sizes that appears more narrowly peaked around larger
glitches sizes. This is due to the fact that a steeper power
law leads to more small events that are not picked up by the
glitch ﬁnder. Size distributions for k = −1.5 thus diﬀer sig-
niﬁcantly from a power-law and show an abundance of larger

glitches. Fitting a power law to the full distribution returns
an index k > −1, and even cutting oﬀ the low end of the
distribution returns a ﬁt that is rejected by a Kolmogorov-
Smirnov (KS) test. For k = −1.5 the waiting time distribu-
tion is also skewed towards longer waiting times compared
to the k = −1.05 case, even if the microphysical choice of
waiting times is the same. Furthermore for k = −1.5 larger
glitches are associated with longer waiting times, as can be
seen in ﬁgure 4, where we plot the waiting time versus size
distribution for a microscopic waiting time of tw = 0.1 days
for the two cases k = −1.5 and k = −1.05. However, we ﬁnd
no signiﬁcant correlation between waiting times and sizes of
glitches, which is consistent with the lack of any such cor-
relation in the observed distributions of glitches in pulsars
(Melatos et al. 2008), with the sole exception of the pulsar
J0537-6910, in which (Middleditch et al. 2006) suggest the
existence of a correlation between the size of a glitch and
the waiting time to the next event.

Mass is also a key factor in determining glitch sizes,
with lower mass stars exhibiting generally larger glitches
than high mass stars, as can be seen from ﬁgure (5), where
we compare a M = 1.1 M(cid:12) and a M = 1.6 M(cid:12) neutron star.
The waiting time distributions, on the other hand, show no
strong dependance on mass.

We have also tested whether the waiting time distri-
bution depends on changes the spin-down rate ˙ΩO ( or
equivalently the height of the maximum of ∆C ). The snow-
plow model of Pizzochero (2011) predicts,
in fact, that
large glitches should occur quasi-periodically as the sys-
tem builds up the maximum lag ∆max
C , on a timescale
C / ˙ΩO. We test this hypothesis by comparing the
τg = ∆max
waiting time distribution for k = −1.5 and tw = 0.1 days for
˙ΩO = −6 × 10−10 and ˙ΩO = −6 × 10−11. We ﬁnd no strong
evidence for a correlation between the spin-down rate and
the glitch waiting time and we do not recover the relation
predicted by Pizzochero (2011) and a KS test returns a 48 %
probability of the two datasets being drawn from the same
distribution. We caution the reader, however, that we have
assumed that there is only a single cause for glitches, namely
vortex avalanches. The ’snowplow’ mechanism suggests that
large glitches occur periodically when a vortex sheet forms
in the crust where the pinning forces is strongest. If such a
mechanism where active together with regularly occurring
avalanches one may expect to see an additional periodic-
ity and abundance of large glitches in the distributions. We
intend to investigate this hypothesis in future work.
