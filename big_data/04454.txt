Abstract

We review various oﬀ-shell formulations for interacting higher-spin systems in dimensions 3 and 4.

Associated with higher-spin systems in spacetime dimension 4 is a Chern–Simons action for a superconnec-

tion taking its values in a direct product of an inﬁnite-dimensional algebra of oscillators and a Frobenius

algebra. A crucial ingredient of the model is that it elevates the rigid closed and central two-form of

Vasiliev’s theory to a dynamical 2-form and doubles the higher-spin algebra, thereby considerably reduc-

ing the number of possible higher spin invariants and giving a nonzero eﬀective functional on-shell. The

two action principles we give for higher-spin systems in 3D are based on Chern–Simons and BF models. In

the ﬁrst case, the theory we give uniﬁes higher-spin gauge ﬁelds with fractional-spin ﬁelds and an internal

sector. In particular, Newton’s constant is related to the coupling constant of the internal sector. In the

second case, the BF action we review gives the fully nonlinear Prokushkin–Vasiliev, bosonic equations

for matter-coupled higher spins in 3D. We present the truncation to a single, real matter ﬁeld relevant

in the Gaberdiel-Gopakumar holographic duality. The link between the various actions we present is the

fact that they all borrow ingredients from Topological Field Theory. It has bee conjectured that there is

an underlying and unifying 2-dimensional ﬁrst-quantised description of the previous higher-spin models

in 3D and 4D, in the form of a Cattaneo–Felder-like topological action containing fermionic ﬁelds.

For our contribution to the proceedings of the International Workshop on Higher Spin Gauge Theories that

took place in Singapore on 5–7 November 2015, we review a number of results presented in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4]

where oﬀ-shell formulations of nonlinear higher-spin systems have been found that describe interacting higher-

spin ﬁelds in spacetime dimensions 3 and 4.

In Section 2 we ﬁrst review the work [3] giving a Frobenius–Chern–Simons model for nonlinear higher-spin

theory in 4D. This model makes use of ingredients provided in the geometrical formulation of higher spin

gravity [5] and the action principle proposed in Ref. [6]. The important new properties are the introduction

of a dynamical 2-form and the attendant phenomenon of the higher spin algebra doubling. This leads to a

more predictive power, as it restricts the possible higher spin invariant functionals.

In Section 3 based on Ref. [2], we review the construction of 3D higher-spin (HS) models coupled to an
internal U (∞)⊗U (∞) sector and fractional-spin ﬁelds. The latter ﬁelds generalise the gravitini and our model
can be seen as an extension of the Achucaro–Townsend Chern–Simons supergravity [7]. In particular, the
couping constant in the U (∞) ⊗ U (∞) internal sector is proportional to the gravitational Newton constant.
In Section 4 based on Ref. [4], we review the construction of an action that reproduces the fully nonlinear

and bosonic Prokushkin–Vasiliev equations [8]. The action is shown to restrict to the Blencowe action [9, 10]

1

thereby reproducing the standard kinetic terms in the higher-spin sector of the action. We also review from

Ref. [4] the unfolded nonlinear equations for 3D HS ﬁelds coupled to a single real scalar ﬁeld in the matter

sector, as this is relevant in the context of the Gaberdiel–Gopakumar duality [11, 12].

Finally, in Section 5 we review the works [1, 13] where a topological open-string model of the Cattaneo–

Felder type [14] was proposed as an underlying ﬁrst-quantised model for higher-spin gauge theory.

2 Frobenius-Chern-Simons Action for 4D Higher Spin Gravity

An outstanding problem in higher spin gravity in four (and higher) dimensions [15, 16, 17] is to ﬁnd an

action principle with desirable properties. Treating this problem as nonlinear completion of Fronsdal kinetic

terms in a Noether procedure approach runs into considerable technical diﬃculties. Indeed, in the metric-

like [18] and the related frame-like [19, 20, 21] approaches, long term eﬀorts — see for example [22, 23]

and [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] in the case of AdS background — has so far led to primarily cubic

interactions. Beyond the cubic order, the fact that higher spin gravity has a mass scale set by the bare

cosmological constant while nonabelian higher spin symmetries require higher derivative vertices, lead to

intractable abelian vertices built from curvatures and their higher derivatives; see [28] and the review [33].

The Noether procedure approach does not exploit the fact that Vasiliev’s equations [15, 16, 17] provide

a fully non-linear description of higher spin gravity on-shell. Furthermore, it is background dependent

procedure since it is based on perturbation around AdS4 . Both drawbacks can be avoided by considering
covariant Hamiltonian actions from which the background independent full Vasiliev equations follow. These

equations are Cartan integrable systems of diﬀerential forms on special noncommutative manifolds taking

their values in associative higher spin algebras. Treating these forms as the fundamental ﬁelds following the

AKSZ approach [34], one is led to a path integral formulation [35] based on covariant Hamiltonian actions

[6] on noncommutative manifolds with boundaries. The importance of the boundaries, which are absent in

the related proposals [36, 37], is that they facilitate the deformation of the bulk action by boundary terms [5]

that contribute to the action but not its variation on-shell. The resulting higher spin amplitudes reproduce

desired holographic correlation functions [38, 39, 40], which are suggestive of an underlying topological open

string [41, 1, 42]. However, the presence of a large number of free parameters impede the predictive power

of the model.

A more predictive model has been proposed in Ref. [3] in which the closed and central holomorphic two

form in Vasiliev equations is elevated to a dynamical two-form master ﬁeld, and the higher spin algebra

is necessarily extended to includ new master one-form ﬁeld. The model also employs an eight dimensional

Frobenius algebra and provides an action which takes the form of a Chern–Simons term for a superconnection

that accommodates all the master ﬁelds. For this reason the model is referred to as the Frobenius–Chern–

Simons (FCS) gauge theory. The construction of the model has been described in detail in Ref. [3]. Here we

shall summarize its salient features.

2

2.1 Base manifold

The model is formulated in terms of diﬀerential forms on the direct product space M9 = X5×Z4, where X5 is a
ﬁve-dimensional commutative manifold with boundary X4 = ∂X5, containing the original spacetime manifold
M4 as a possibly open subset, and Z4 is a four-dimensional noncommutative space without boundary. Thus,
∂M9 = X4 × Z4, where X5 = X4 × [0,∞[ .

The topology of Z4 may be chosen in a variety ways with nontrivial and interesting consequences to be
In Ref. [3], Z4 is obtained from the standard noncommutative C4 by choosing a real form
and a compatible convolution formula for the star product and then adding points at inﬁnity to create a
compact noncommutative space that can be used to deﬁne a (graded cyclic) trace operation. Moreover, Z4
is taken to be closed to avoid boundary terms, and that its structure admits a certain closed two-form and

investigated.

a global SL(2; C) symmetry, in order to make contact with Vasiliev’s theory. To this end, one introduces
canonical coordinates (zα, ¯z ˙α) (α, ˙α = 1, 2) and anti-commuting diﬀerentials (dzα, d¯z ˙α) on C4. We then
consider a formally deﬁned associative star product algebra given by the space Ω(C4) of diﬀerential forms
equipped with two associative composition rules, namely the standard graded commutative wedge product

rule, denoted by juxtaposition, and the graded noncommutative rule

f ⋆ g = f exp(cid:16)−i(←−∂ α−→∂α + ←−¯∂ ˙α−→¯∂ ˙α)(cid:17) g ,

The star product is thus the representation using Weyl ordering symbols of the associative algebra of com-

posite operators built from anti-commuting line elements and noncommutative coordinates with canonical

commutation rules

[zα, zβ]⋆ = −2iǫαβ ,

[zα, ¯z ˙α]⋆ = 0 ,

[¯z ˙α, ¯z

˙β]⋆ = −2iǫ ˙α ˙β .

In models with four-dimensional Lorentz symmetry, it is natural to select real forms on the real slice

4 =(cid:8)(zα, ¯z ˙α) : (zα)† = −¯z ˙α ,
RC

on which zα is thus a complex doublet.

(¯z ˙α)† = −zα(cid:9) ∼= C2 × C2 ⊂ C4 ,

(2.2)

(2.3)

In order to include Gaussian elements and distributions, it is useful to ﬁrst introduce auxiliary integral

representations of the star product (2.1) as follows

The graded cyclic trace operation on Ω(Z4) is deﬁned as

STrΩ(Z4) f =ZRR

f ,

which projects onto the top form in f . Thus, if f is a top form in Ω(Z4) then its representative in Ω(RR
4 )
must fall oﬀ suﬃciently fast at inﬁnity for the integral to be convergent. Therefore, Z4 must be a compact
manifold obtained by adding points to RR
4 at inﬁnity to extend its diﬀerential Poisson algebra structure
[43, 44, 45, 46] (see also [1, 13]). This can be achieved by assuming that Z4 admits a Poisson structure and
a compatible pre-connection. The latter is assumed to be trivial for simplicity. In addition, Z4 is required to
be closed, such that STrΩ(Z4) df = 0, in order to avoid boundary terms from Z4 in varying the FCS action.
Assuming that f and g are two smooth symbols that fall oﬀ suﬃciently fast, it follows from (2.4) that

STrΩ(Z4) f ⋆ g =ZRR

4

f ⋆ g =ZRR

4

f g ,

(2.7)

which is graded cyclic. As this property will be useful in analyzing boundary conditions in the FCS model
arising from the variational principle, we shall assume that (2.7) holds for all elements in Ω(Z4) including
distributions. Finally, in order to obtain Vasiliev’s equations from the FCS action, it is assumed that Ω(Z4)
admits global SL(2; C) symmetry and contains the (globally deﬁned) closed two-forms

where the inner Klein operator

jz = −

i
4

dzαdzακz ,

¯j¯z = (jz)† ,

κz = 2πδ2(zα) .

A choice of topology that satisﬁes all of the requirements as stated above iis given by1

Ω(Z4) = Mm, ¯m=0,1

(Ω(S2) ⋆ (jz)⋆m) ⊗ (Ω(S2) ⋆ (¯j¯z)⋆ ¯m) ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

where Ω(S2) consists of globally deﬁned forms on S2 with Poisson structure obtained by extending the Poisson
structure of (2.1) to the point at ∞. At this point, the resulting Poisson bivector and all its derivatives vanish.
Hence, provided it is possible to exchange the order of diﬀerentiation and summation in (2.1) and using the

fact that increasing number of derivatives of a form that falls oﬀ yields forms that fall oﬀ even faster, it
follows that if f, g ∈ Ω(S2) then (f ⋆ g)|∞ = f|∞g|∞ i.e. the point at inﬁnity is a commuting point of Ω(S2).
In other words, one is working with a topological two-sphere equipped with a diﬀerential Poisson algebra
with trivial pre-connection. Moreover, in order for the elements in Ω(Z4) to have ﬁnite traces, it is assumed
that the top forms on each two-sphere fall oﬀ suﬃciently fast at inﬁnity working in the original R2 × R2
coordinate chart. For this fall-oﬀ condition to be embeddable in a diﬀerential star product algebra, also the

forms in lower degrees must fall oﬀ appropriately at inﬁnity. In particular, the only forms that can have ﬁnite

values at inﬁnity are the zero-forms. Thus, in eﬀect, one has

Z4 = S2 × S2 ,

(2.11)

by assuming boundary conditions at the commuting points at inﬁnity and allowing for delta function distri-

butions at the origins so as to create a space of forms that is closed under exterior diﬀerentiation and star

(2.14)

products, and has a space of top forms with ﬁnite traces that vanish for exact elements and obey (2.7). For

this to hold true it is important that the delta function κz always appears together with line elements in the
combination jz given in (2.8), which obeys jz ⋆ jz = 0, whereas the inclusion of κz into the algebra would
require the inclusion of jz ⋆ κz as well which is not integrable.

2.2 Superconnection and Frobenius-Chern-Simons action

The construction of the FCS action employs an eight-dimensional, 3-graded Frobenius algebra

F = F (−1) ⊕ F (0) ⊕ F (+1) ,

(eij , h eij) ∈ F (i−j) ,

(2.12)

where eij is the 2 × 2 matrix whose only non-vanishing entry is a 1 at the ith row and jth column, and h is
a Klein element satisfying [h, e11] = 0 = [h, e22] ,{h, e12} = 0 = {h, e12} . The coordinate-like master ﬁelds
are assembled into

and the momentum-like master ﬁelds, which will play the role of Lagrange multipliers, into

The above master ﬁelds are duality extended in the sense that they are formal sums of forms with degrees

deg(B, A, eA, eB) = {(2n, 1 + 2n, 1 + 2n, 2 + 2n)}n=0,1,2,3 ,
deg(eU , V,eV , U ) = {(8 − 2n, 7 − 2n, 7 − 2n, 6 − 2n)}n=0,1,2,3 .

One then proceeds by deﬁning a superconnection and superdiﬀerential [47] as

Z = hX + P ,

(2.15)

(2.16)

respectively, which are thus objects with odd total degree given by form degree plus Frobenius 3-degree. The
space Ω(M9) of diﬀerential forms is equipped with two associative composition rules, namely the standard
graded commutative wedge product rule, denoted by juxtaposition, and Weyl ordered star products of func-

tions. The need for Weyl ordering is due to the property (2.7) that is crucial for the boundary conditions

to make sense in a noncommutative set up. Once one has put any star-product expression in its factorized

form in Y and Z, say F (Y ) ⋆ G(Z) equal to F (Y )G(Z) in Weyl order, one makes assumptions about the

functional classes to which F (Y ) and G(Z) belong. See Section 3.7 of [48] for details.

For reasons explained in detail in [3], the action function is expressed in terms of globally deﬁned conﬁg-

urations in

where

E = Ω(X5) ⊗

2

(1 + π¯π)(cid:2)Ω(Z4) ⊗ A ⊗ 1

2 (1 + k ⋆ ¯k)(cid:3) ,

A = F ⊗ W0 ⊗ K .

5

(2.17)

(2.18)

Furthermore, W0 is an extended Weyl algebra

W0 = Mr,¯r=0,1

Aq(2) ⋆ (κy)⋆r ⋆ (¯κ¯y)⋆¯r

(2.19)

where Aq(2) consists of star polynomials in two complex doublets (yα, ¯y ˙α), α, ˙α = 1, 2, obeying the oscillator
algebra

[yα, yβ]⋆ = 2iǫαβ ,

[yα, ¯y

˙β]⋆ = 0 ,

[¯y ˙α, ¯y

˙β]⋆ = 2iǫ ˙α ˙β .

The inner Klein operators in Weyl order are deﬁned as

κy := 2πδ2(y) ,

¯κ¯y := 2πδ2(¯y) ,

so that P ∈ W0 obey

κy ⋆ P ⋆ κy = πy(P ) ,

¯κ¯y ⋆ P ⋆ ¯κ¯y = ¯π¯y(P ) ,

where πy and ¯π¯y are inner automorphisms whose action in Weyl order is given by

πy(y) = −y ,

¯π¯y(¯y) = −¯y ,

leaving intact all the Klein operators. Thus, the generic elements of W0 is of the form

P = Xr,¯r=0,1

P r,¯r
α(n), ˙α(¯n)(κy)⋆r ⋆ (¯κ¯y)⋆¯ry(α1 ⋆ ··· ⋆ yαn) ⋆ ¯y( ˙α1 ⋆ ··· ⋆ ¯y ˙α ¯n) .

Turning to K, it is the collection of outer Klein operators

K = {1, k, ¯k, k ⋆ ¯k} .

where for f ∈ E, the adjoint action

k ⋆ f ⋆ k = π(f ) ,

¯k ⋆ f ⋆ ¯k = ¯π(f ) ,

and the outer automorphisms ¯π and ¯π with the only nontrivial actions

Employing the ingredients summarized above, the following action has been proposed [3]

π(y, z) = (−y,−z) ,

¯π(¯y, ¯z) = (−¯y,−¯z) .

TrA [hπh(Z) ⋆ Z] ,

(2.28)

Keeping in mind that f ∈ E, the operation TrA is deﬁned as

S =ZM9

TrA f :=ZX5

STrΩ(Z4) TrF TrW0 TrKf ,

6

where STrΩ(Z4) is deﬁned in (2.6), and the remaining trace operations are deﬁned as

eijM ij(h) = M 11(0) + M 22(0) ,

TrFXi,j

TrW0 P = P 1,1(0, 0) ,
TrKf = f|k=0=¯k ,

with P ∈ W0 from (2.24) which furnishes the deﬁnition of P 1,1(0, 0). Deﬁning TrE f :=RM9

shown that TrE f ⋆ g = TrE g ⋆ f [3].

The total variation of the FCS action gives

δS =ZM9

TrA δZ ⋆ R +

2IM9

TrA h δZ ⋆ (Z + πh(Z)) ,

where the Cartan curvature

R := qZ + Z ⋆ Z .

Thus, imposing the boundary condition

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

TrA f , it can be

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

(Z + πh(Z))(cid:12)(cid:12)∂M9

= 0 ,

one has the equation of motion R = 0 . This equation is Cartan integrable, hence gauge invariant, with

transformations

One the other hand, the requirement of gauge invariance of the action gives the following boundary conditions

δZ = qθ + [Z, θ]⋆ ,

δR = [R, θ]⋆ .

(2.37)

(θ − πh(θ)) |∂M9 = 0 .

(2.38)

In obtaining this result, the property (2.7) plays an important role. Setting aside nontrivial ﬂat connections

due to the noncommutativity of the base manifold, Z can be given on-shell in terms of a gauge function L

(which contains forms in diﬀerent degrees) and a zero-form integration constant C, viz.

Z = L⋆(−1) ⋆ (q + C) ⋆ L ,

qC = C ⋆ C = 0 ,

(2.39)

where the algebraic condition on C is a consequence of the fact that the form content is as given in (2.15).

The superconnection Z is assumed to be globally deﬁned. However, if it is rather given by a set of
representatives deﬁned locally on charts that cover M9, the appropriate global deﬁnition of the action is
described in Ref. [3]. In doing so, it proves convenient to write the action (2.28) in terms of master ﬁelds

(X, P ) deﬁned via Z = hX + P . Thanks to the boundary term in (2.28), one ﬁnds [3]

where F X := dX + hXh ⋆ X. The general variation of this action (2.28) reads

S =ZM9

TrA (cid:0)P ⋆ F X + 1

3 P ⋆ P ⋆ P(cid:1) ,

δS =ZM9

TrA (cid:0)δX ⋆ RP h + δP ⋆ RX + d(δX ⋆ P )(cid:1) ,

7

(2.40)

(2.41)

where the total derivatives cancel between neighboring patches (in the interior of M9) since δX and P belong
to sections. Writing R = RX + RP where

RX := F X + P ⋆ P ,

RP := qP + hX ⋆ P + P ⋆ hX ,

then on shell we have RX = 0 and RP = 0 , and we are left with

δS =ZM9

TrA d(δX ⋆ P ) =I∂M9

TrA δX ⋆ P .

(2.42)

(2.43)

Using crucially the property (2.7) to replace the star product in Ω(Z4) by the classical product (keeping in
mind that jz ⋆ jz = 0), the variation becomes

δS =I∂M9

TrA δX ⋆A P .

Hence, if X is free to ﬂuctuate at ∂M9, it follows from the variational principle that

P|∂M9 = 0 .

(2.44)

(2.45)

Finally, while action is invariant under the gauge transformations with parameters ǫX , it transforms into a
total derivative under transformations with parameters ǫP , viz.

(2.46)

(2.47)

(2.48)

(2.49)

(2.50)

δǫP S =ZM9

TrA d(cid:0)ǫP ⋆ RX(cid:1) ,

that vanishes provided that ǫP belongs to the same section as P , and

that is indeed equivalent to (2.38).

Using Z = hX + P , the gauge transformations (2.37) read

ǫP|∂M9 = 0

δX =dǫX + X ⋆ ǫX − hǫX h ⋆ X + hP h ⋆ ǫP − ǫP ⋆ P ,
δP =dǫP + hXh ⋆ ǫP − hǫP h ⋆ X + [P, ǫX ]⋆ .

2.3 Component formulation

The action (2.28), upon using the deﬁnitions (2.13), (2.14) and (2.16), takes the form

where

S = ZM9

TrW⊗KheU ⋆ DB + V ⋆(cid:16)F − B ⋆ eB + 1
+U ⋆ eDeB +eV ⋆(cid:16)eF − eB ⋆ B + 1

DV := dV + A ⋆ V + V ⋆ A ,

eDeB := deB + eA ⋆ eB − eB ⋆ A ,
eDeU := deU + eA ⋆eU −eU ⋆ A ,
eDeV := deV + eA ⋆eV +eV ⋆ eA .

The bulk equations of motion, which amount to vanishing Cartan curvatures, read

The gauge parameter can be written as θ = ǫX + hǫP , where

2{B, eB}⋆ = 0 ,

The transformation rules for the component ﬁelds can be readily obtained from (2.48) by using the deﬁnitions

(2.13) and (2.14). Thus, on ∂M9, where (U,eU ; V,eV ) vanish, one ﬁnds
eDeB = 0 ,

DB = 0 ,

which is the desired modiﬁcation of Vasiliev’s original system [15, 16]. Alternatively, going to the basis

the equations of motion on ∂M9 read
FW + K ⋆ K −

[eB, B]⋆ = 0 ,

DW eB + {K,eB}⋆ = 0 ,

where we have deﬁned DW f = df + W ⋆ f − (−1)deg(f)f ⋆ W and FW = dW + W 2. Since ǫP|∂M9 = 0, recalling

the gauge transformations under which the ﬁeld equations (2.55) are invariant can be written as

ǫ = α − β ,

the notation (2.52), and splitting the gauge parameters (ǫ,eǫ) as
eǫ = α + β ,
2 {eη, B}⋆ + 1
2 [eη, B]⋆ + 1

δK = DW β + [K, α]⋆ + 1
δB = DW η + [B, α]⋆ − [K, η]⋆ + {B, β}⋆ ,

2 {eB, η}⋆ ,
2 [eB, η]⋆ ,
δeB = DWeη + [eB, α]⋆ + [K,eη]⋆ − {eB, β}⋆ .

2.4 Comparison with the duality extended Vasiliev system

δW = DW α + [K, β]⋆ + 1

In Ref. [3] it has been shown that bay taking K = 0 and choosing eB appropriately, the equations of motion

on ∂M9 given in (2.55) take the form

FW − V ⋆ J + V ⋆ J + U0 ⋆ J ⋆ J + U1 ⋆ J[2] + U2 ⋆ J[4] = 0 ,

FW − V ⋆ J + V ⋆ J + U0 ⋆ J ⋆ J + gJ ⋆ J + L[2] + L[4] = 0 ,
DW B = 0 ,

(2.60)

where L[2] and L[4] are two new dynamical ﬁelds, referred to as Lagrangian forms, given by globally deﬁned
central and closed elements of degrees two and four, respectively. As far as the local dynamics is concerned,

the two systems are equivalent in form degrees zero and one, since one can always choose a representative for
L[2] that vanishes in a given coordinate chart. In higher form degrees, the duality extended Vasiliev system
contains the term gJ ⋆ J and the Lagrangian forms, which are not present in the FCS system2. In Ref. [49],

the integralH L[2] has been interpreted as a black hole charge, as has been substantiated black hole solution

[50]. As for the integral of L[4] over spacetime, it has been proposed [49] as the generating functional of
correlators within the context of holography 3. An important open problem in this framework is how to
account for loop corrections. It has been suggested that the quantum mechanical eﬀects may emerge from

classical dynamics in an inﬁnite dimensional space that has enough room to describe all multiparticle states

in the system [51]. If true, this would be a drastically new way of looking at quantum gravity. The tests of

these proposals remain to be seen.

In the approach of Ref. [3] a path integral formulation of the FCS model is proposed along the same

lines as the AKSZ construction of Ref. [35] within the geometric framework of Ref. [5]. In this approach, the

terms proportional to the closed and central elements in (2.58), which are similar to the Lagrangian form

terms in (2.60) but play a diﬀerent role, as the computation of the eﬀective action proceeds in this case by

means of path integral quantization rules which necessarily involves the FCS action itself. The advantage of

this approach is the availability of path integral formulation for quantization. The computation of quantum

eﬀects are left to future work but an outline of the the role of certain topological invariants in the construction

of the on-shell eﬀective action is given in Ref. [3], which we summarize below.

2.5 On-shell actions from topological invariants

Starting from an AKSZ path integral on M9 = [0,∞[×X4 × Z4, where all ﬁelds vanish at {∞} × X4 × Z4
and in addition P|{0}×X4×Z4 = 0, as required by the Batalin–Vilkovisky master equation, one ﬁnds that
SH vanishes on-shell. Following [5], one may generate an on-shell action by adding to SH a globally deﬁned

2 Whether such coupling can be obtained either by expanding B around a constant background value or allowing the

dependence of eB on B to contain a simple pole, remains to be seen.

3Another proposal for the black hole entropy and generating functional of correlators in higher spin gravity has been made

in Ref. [5].

boundary term Stop = H∂M9 V(X, dX), whose total variation vanishes oﬀ-shell, i.e. Stop is a topological

invariant. by its evaluation [49] on the Didenko–Vasiliev Assuming that Stop does not aﬀect the boundary
condition on P nor the equations of motion, one may argue that the on-shell action is given by Stop.

Aspects of topological invariants for a general structure group are discussed in Ref. [3], where it is also

shown that taking it to be generated by α-transformation displayed in (2.57), one has the invariants

Stop[W, K] =

FWt = FW + tDW K + t2K ⋆ K ,

(2.62)

and βn,p are linear diﬀerential operators of order (2n − 1) in d/dt with constant coeﬃcients.Thus, there are
2, 3, 4 invariants for p = 0, 1, 2, respectively. The on-shell value of Stop[W, K] is built out of integrals of traces

of B ⋆ eB, eB ⋆ B and K ⋆ K forming a ﬁnite set of invariants. The observables are invariant oﬀ shell under
gauge transformations with parameter α, and on shell using parameters (β, η,eη). In the semi-classical limit,

one has the partition function [3]

2.6 Linearized Fluctuations

The theory on the boundary of M9 admits the vacuum solutions

W (0) = L−1 ⋆ dL ,

K (0) = 0 ,

B(0) = 0 ,

(2.64)

where L is a gauge function (consisting of forms) and I is a closed and central element on ∂M9. In particular,
to describe Vasiliev’s phase of the theory, it is assumeed that

I = JX + eiθ0 J − e−iθ0J ,

(2.65)

where JX is a closed a central element on X4, J and J are the closed and central elements on Z4 deﬁned in
(2.59), and θ0 is an arbitrary real constant. The ﬂuctuations in the boundary ﬁelds can be expanded as

eB(0) = I ,

(W − W (0), B, K, eB − eB(0)) =Xn>1

(W (n), B(n), K (n), eB(n)) .

At the ﬁrst order, the equations of motion (2.55) read

one has switch from Weyl order to normal order and perform a change of gauge in order to make direct
contact with Vasiliev’s original perturbative expansion (in which zαAα = 0 in normal order), which complies

12

with the Central On Mass Shell Theorem (COMST). It is important that despite the fact that the FCS

model is formulated in the Weyl order, for reasons explained in Section 4, its physical spectrum agrees

with the Vasiliev theory, and hence its perturbative expansion should obey the COMST as well. Although

a naive transformation of the perturbatively deﬁned master ﬁelds from normal to Weyl order is known to
produce singularities [52]4, the FCS master ﬁelds belong to an extended class of symbols, including inner
Klein operators, which yields a well-deﬁned perturbation theory in a speciﬁc holomorphic gauge (deﬁned by
zαAα = 0 in Weyl order). Indeed, working with deﬁnite boundary conditions (corresponding to generalized
Type D solutions [54]), the resulting linearized ﬁelds can be mapped to Vasiliev’s basis. We plan to examine

whether this remains the case for more general boundary conditions and to higher orders in the perturbative

expansion.

3 Fractional spin gravity theory

In 2 + 1 dimensions Vasiliev’s higher-spin gravity, or more speciﬁcally the Prokushkin–Vasiliev model [8],

admits truncation to Chern–Simons higher spin gravity [9, 55]. In Ref.

[55] the gauge connection is val-

ued in a higher spin algebra that consists of monomials of Wigner-Heisenberg deformed oscillator operators.

Monomials of the same order transform in spinor-tensorial representations of the AdS3 algebra, with arbi-
trary half-integer spins (which includes integer and half-an-integer values), and the correspondent ﬁelds have

standard boson or fermion statistics. However, in 2 + 1 dimensional spacetimes the representations of the

so(2, 1) algebra admit spin interpolating half-integer numbers [56, 57] and are referred to as fractional. The

physical realisations of fractional spins are known as anyons, and their statistics interpolates between bosons

and fermions [58, 59, 60].

As higher spin gravity aims at describing ﬁelds with arbitrary spin, for completeness, in three dimensions

it should be extended to incorporate fundamental fractional-spin ﬁelds. The ﬁrst step to achieve this goal was

given in [61] using operator formalism. Later this was done in Ref. [2] by means of deformation quantization

methods — i.e. using star-products [62].

The model constructed in Ref.

[2] is a Chern–Simons theory for a gauge ﬁeld that can be expressed in

the form

where the blocks correspond to four diﬀerent sectors of the gauge algebra of the theory, A(2; ν|w) , dubbed
fractional-spin algebra, which we shall introduce below. To these sectors we associate a higher-spin gravity

connection W , an internal connection 1-form U and the “fractional-spin gravitinos” (ψ, ψ) .

Indeed, the

Chern–Simons action obtained for (3.1) resembles the Achucarro–Townsend theory [7] of supergravity in

three dimensions. However, any attempt to extend standard supergravity with fractional-spin ﬁelds would

lead to higher spin gravity. Since fractional-spin Lorentz representations are inﬁnite dimensional, there appear

inﬁnitely many additional symmetries that can be gauged: The higher spin symmetries. The naive matrix

(super)trace gives rise, in this context, to divergences that cannot readily be regularised consistently without

changing the deﬁnition of super-traces of matrices. One achievement of [2] can be regarded as a solution to
this problem; see [63] and [64] for a related discussion and an extension of the naive matrix trace.5

In what follows we present the main points that lead to the formulation of fractional-spin gravity as

presented in Ref.

[2]. Here we give a somewhat simpliﬁed presentation compared the more technical work

[2] to which we refer for a complete and precise treatment.

3.1 The fractional spins algebra

The building block of the fractional spin algebra is the algebra Aq(2; ν) introduced by Vasiliev [55] and

identiﬁed with the universal enveloping algebra of the deformed oscillator algebra [65, 66] (see also the Refs.

[67, 68]), in turn presented by

[qα, qβ]⋆ = 2i(1 + νk)ǫαβ ,

{k, qα}⋆ = 0 ,

k ⋆ k = 1 ,

(qα)† = qα ,

k† = k ,

ν ∈ R .

(3.2)

(3.3)

The associative algebra Aq(2; ν) consists of arbitrary star polynomials (of ﬁnite degree) in (qα, k) , which in
Weyl order read

where the symmetrisation has unit strength. We split the algebra in four sectors, using the projected elements

Tα(n) := qα1 ··· qαn ≡ q(α1 ⋆ ··· ⋆ qαn) ,

Tα(n) ⋆ k ,

which are non-vanishing iﬀ σσ′ = (−1)n . These projections belong to the sub-algebras Aq(2; ν)σ,σ′
=
Πσ ⋆ Aq(2; ν) ⋆ Πσ′
∈ Aq(2; ν). Formally, the space Aq(2; ν) does not contain distribution (non-polynomial)
class of functions. It is necessary, in order to support fractional spins, to extend Aq(2; ν) with certain “w-class

distributions”, where w refers to the operator which is diagonalised by them. We will refer to the algebra of

these elements as Aw(2; ν). The operator w appears in the deﬁnition of the spin operator

in the connection. More generally, the spin part of the Lorentz transformation is generated by

The distribution needed to describe fractional spin are solutions of the “star-genvalue” problem,

by virtue of (3.14). TE0 can be identiﬁed with the ground state non-normalised projector |0)(0| of the
deformed harmonic oscillator introduced by Wigner [65, 66]. Higher states can be generated by the left and

right ⋆-multiplication of elements of Aq(2; ν), in terms of ⋆-powers of ladder operators,

|m)(n| = (a+)⋆n ⋆ |0)(0| ⋆ (a−)⋆n ,

such that

The projector Π+ in the deﬁnition of Ja makes its action trivial on odd parity labels since Π+ ⋆|2n + 1)(m| =

where the projections

Because the projector Π+ in its deﬁnition, Ja acts non-trivially only in the upper diagonal block (of higher
spin gravity) and on the oﬀ-diagonal blocks (“fractional spin gravitinos”), while the lower diagonal block U

(of internal interactions) does not transform. Internal transformations, whose basis of generators is given by
|2m + 1)(2n + 1| (up to normalisations and reality conditions), act non-trivialy on fractional spin ﬁelds and
on itself.

As we are interested to show how fractional spins make their appearance, let us perform a rotation by
2π , focusing in the sector A(2; ν|w)±,∓. The parameter of transformation is given by ǫ = 2πJ0, hence single
elements of the basis of the sectors A(2; ν|w)±,∓ transform as

(3.29)

(3.30)

hence it follows that the projector basis |odd)(even| ⊕ |even)(odd| have non-fermionic/bosonic statistical
phases. Note that for odd values of ν the phases become fermionic or bosonic. The cases ν negative-odd

are critical, in the sense that the representations of the Lorentz algebra become non-unitary and decouple in

two sectors, of ﬁnite dimension and non-unitary, and of inﬁnite dimension and unitary. For positive-odd ν

the representations of half-integer spin of the Lorentz algebra are unitary and inﬁnite dimensional. Thus, for

half-integer values of the spin, there appear diﬀerent representations of the Lorentz group. Indeed, the second

(inﬁnite dimensional case) is more exotic, since the ﬁeld theory of these type of representation is less known,

while in the ﬁnite dimensional case the ﬁeld theories are standard, including e.g. Dirac, Rarita–Schwinger, or

Bargmann–Wigner, and well known gauge gravity models including SL(N )-like Chern–Simons higher spin

gravities in three dimensions. For ﬁeld theories of inﬁnite dimensional representations with half-integer spins

the reader can consult the Refs. [69, 70, 71, 72]. More details and complete analysis on the fractional spin

algebra and its critical limits can be found in Refs. [61, 2].

3.2 Gravitational and gauge couplings from Chern-Simons fractional spin grav-

ity

For a polynomial class of functions, with elements f (q; k) Vasiliev’s super-trace is given by,

STrAq(2;ν)f (q; k) = f (0;−ν)

(3.31)

It is not straightforward that Vasiliev’s super-trace (3.31) will be consistent when operating on elements of

the fractional spin algebra, because the presence of non-polynomial functions. It suﬃces to establish two

consistency conditions: (i) Finite star products, ii) Finite Vasiliev supertraces (which together with (i) implies

cyclicity).

The condition (i) implies that

|0)(0| ⋆ |0)(0| = N −1 |0)(0| ,

N ∈ ]0,∞[ ,

(3.32)

where N is a normalisation constant. This calculation was veriﬁed up to ﬁrst order in w-power series and
at all order in ν . Assuming that this remains true for all order in w implies the existence of a normalised

17

projector

|0ih0| := N |0)(0| ,

|0ih0| ⋆ |0ih0| = |0ih0| ,

(3.33)

and the normalisation can be obtained trusting on the supertrace applied to the latter product, for which we

need to compute just the zero order term in the w-expansion. Doing so we obtain

N −1 =

1 − ν
2

.

(3.34)

Before writing down the Chern–Simon action, we should introduce a Cliﬀord algebra {1, Γ} , Γ2 = 1 ,
which will allow us to double8 the fractional higher spin algebra and embed in it the AdS3 isometry algebra
so(2, 2) ∼= so(2, 1) ⊕ so(2, 1) . The supertrace of functions in oscillator variables and Γ is now deﬁned as

for short. A proper assignment of semi-classical statistics for the components of the fractional-spin ﬁelds ψ and ¯ψ requires the
introduction of a fermionic Klein operator denoted ξ in Ref. [2] s.t. the components of the one-form A ∈ A(2; ν|w) ⊗ Cliﬀ(Γ) ⊗

(3.54)

Here we observe how the fractional-spin ﬁelds source the ﬁeld strength of higher-spin gravity and the internal

interactions, while they couple minimally to the latter interactions, either from the left or right actions. We

can visualise this result as saying that fractional-spin charges carry higher-spin gravity ﬂuxes.

To conclude this section, we would like to mention that we have omitted many details for the sake of

simplicity. The complete treatment can be found in Ref. [2]. In terms of the notation of Ref.
[2], here we
took the choice σ = +1 , ǫ = +1 and considered the fractional-spin algebra A+ for which the component
ﬁelds in the “gravitino” sector are fermionic and multiplied by the fermionic Kleinien ξ .

4 Matter-coupled 3D higher-spin gravity

In this section, we review the results of Ref. [4] where an action was provided for matter-coupled 3D higher-

spin gravity, that reproduces upon variation the full nonlinear bosonic Prokushkin–Vasiliev (PV) equations.

We take the opportunity to review the PV equations and spell out the truncation of the PV spectrum

of matter ﬁelds to a single real scalar ﬁeld. This minimal truncation can be useful in the context of the

Gaberdiel–Gopakumar conjecture [11]. See Ref. [12] for a review.

4.1 Geometric Formulation of Prokushkin–Vasiliev’s system

In this subsection we are going to present a geometric formulation of Prokushkin–Vasiliev systems [8], de-

scribing matter coupled to gauge ﬁelds in three dimensional spacetime. Master ﬁelds consist of a one form
A and a zero form B, deﬁned on a so-called correspondence space M5 = M3 × Z2, where M3 is the three
dimensional spacetime manifold with local coordinates xµ, and Z2 is a non-commutative manifold with co-
ordinates zα, α = 1, 2. The ﬁelds take value in the higher spin algebra that extends sp(2, R), generated by
twistor variables yα, and are tensored with elements Γi that generate a Cliﬀord algebra: {Γi, Γj} = 2δij, for
i, j = 1, .., N .

A = dxµUµ(x, z|y; Γi) + dzαVα(x, z|y; Γi) , B = B(x, z|y; Γi) .

(4.1)

The dependence of the master ﬁelds on (yα, zα) is treated using symbol calculus, whereby they belong to
classes of functions (or distributions) on Y2 × Z2 that can be composed using two associative products: the
standard commutative product rule, denoted by juxtaposition, and an additional noncommutative product

rule, denoted by a ⋆ . In what follows, we shall use the normal ordered basis in which the star product rule

is deﬁned formally by

(f ⋆ g)(y, z) :=ZR4

d2ud2v
(2π)2 eivαuα f (y + u, z + u) g(y + v, z − v) ,

(4.2)

whereas a more rigorous deﬁnition requires a set of fusion rules. In particular, the above composition rule
rigorously deﬁnes the associative Weyl algebra Aq(4). This algebra consists of arbitrary polynomials in yα

20

and zα, modulo

yα ⋆ yβ = yαyβ + iǫαβ ,

yα ⋆ zβ = yαzβ − iǫαβ ,

zα ⋆ yβ = zαyβ + iǫαβ ,

zα ⋆ zβ = zαzβ − iǫαβ ,

(4.3)

(4.4)

whose symmetric and anti-symmetric parts, respectively, deﬁne the normal order and the (ordering indepen-
dent) commutation rules, viz.11

[yα, yβ]⋆ = −[zα, zβ]⋆ = 2iǫαβ ,

[yα, zβ]⋆ = 0 .

The basis one-forms (dxµ, dzα) obey

[dxµ, f ]⋆ = 0 = [dzα, f ]⋆ ,

where the graded star commutator of diﬀerential forms is given by

[f, g]⋆ = f ⋆ g − (−1)deg(f )deg(g)g ⋆ f ,

with deg denoting the total form degree on M3 × Z2 . To describe bosonic models, we impose

π(A) = A ,

π(B) = B

where π is the automorphism of the diﬀerential star product algebra deﬁned by

π(xµ, dxµ, zα, dzα, yα, Γi) = (xµ, dxµ,−zα,−dzα,−yα, Γi) .

The hermitian conjugation is deﬁned by

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

(f ⋆ g)† = (−1)deg(f)deg(g)g† ⋆ f † ,

(zα, dzα; yα, Γi)† = (−zα,−dzα; yα, Γi) .

(4.10)

and the reality conditions on the master ﬁelds read

A† = −A ,

B† = B .

Deﬁning

F = dA + A ⋆ A , DB = dB + A ⋆ B − B ⋆ A ,

d = dxµ∂µ + dzα ∂

∂zα ,

where the diﬀerential obeys

d(f ⋆ g) = (df ) ⋆ g + (−1)deg(f)f ⋆ dg ,

(df )† = d(f †) ,

the PV ﬁeld equations can be written as

F + B ⋆ J = 0 ,

DB = 0 ,

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

11The doublet variables yα and zα form Majorana spinors once the equations are cast into a manifestly Lorentz covariant

form.

21

where

The element J is closed and central in the space of π-invariant forms, viz.

J := − i

4 dzαdzα κ

κ := eiyαzα .

dJ = 0 ,

J ⋆ f = π(f ) ⋆ J ,

as can be seen from the fact that κ, which is referred to as the inner Klein operator, obeys

κ ⋆ f (x, dx, z, dz, y, Γi) ⋆ κ = f (x, dx,−z, dz,−y, Γi) .

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

It follows that (4.14) deﬁnes a universally Cartan integrable system (i.e. a set of generalized curvature
constraints compatible with d2 ≡ 0 in any dimension). The Cartan gauge transformations take the form

δǫA = dǫ + [A, ǫ]⋆ ,

δǫB = [B, ǫ]⋆ .

(4.18)

In order to see the equivalence with Prokushkin–Vasiliev systems, let us introduce the oscillator-like ﬁelds
Sα := zα − 2i Vα and split the ﬁeld equations in dx and dz directions, thus obtaining
dX Sα + [U, Sα]⋆ = 0 ,

dX B + [U, B]⋆ = 0 ,

dX U + U ⋆ U = 0 ,

(4.19)

[Sα, B]⋆ = 0 ,

[Sα, Sβ]⋆ = −2iǫαβ(cid:0)1 − B ⋆ κ(cid:1) ,

where dX := dxµ∂µ is the spacetime diﬀerential. We stress that, due to the bosonic projection, one has
{Sα, κ}⋆ = 0, that will be crucial for the discussion of massive vacua.

Massless vacua. Let us analyse the above system around the vacuum solution B0 = 0 . From the vacuum
equation [S0α, S0β]⋆ = −2iǫαβ one can take S0α = zα and hence

0 = [zα, U0]⋆ = −2i

∂U0
∂zα → U0 = Ω(x|y; Γi) ,

(4.20)

and the remaining equation is the ﬂatness condition dΩ + Ω ⋆ Ω = 0 . Bilinears in y variables generate sp(2, R)

under star-commutators:

Tαβ :=

1
2i

yαyβ ,

[Tαβ, Tγδ]⋆ = 4ǫ(α(γ Tβ)δ) ,

(4.21)

but some outer element is needed in order to double sp(2, R) and thus represent the AdS3 isometry algebra
sp(2, R) ⊕ sp(2, R).
In order to describe massless vacua, it turns out that the minimal dimension of the
Cliﬀord algebra is N = 2 , and one can write the vacuum spacetime connection as

Ω(x|y; Γi) =

1

4i(cid:16)ωαβ(x) yαyβ + Γ1 eαβ(x) yαyβ(cid:17) ≡ ω + Γ1 e ,

(4.22)

where ωαβ and eαβ are the background Lorentz connection and dreibein, respectively. The ﬂatness condition

amounts then to

deαβ + 2ω(α

γ ∧ eβ)γ = 0 ,

dωαβ + ωα

γ ∧ ωβγ = −eα

γ ∧ eβγ ,

(4.23)

22

that indeed describes AdS3 spacetime with unit radius. In order to study ﬂuctuations around this vacuum
we expand the master ﬁelds as U = Ω + w1 + .., B = 0 + B1 + .. and Sα = zα + S1α + .., and the ﬁeld
equations for ﬁrst order ﬂuctuations read

D0w1 = 0 , D0B1 = 0 , D0Sα + 2i

∂B1
∂zα = 0 ,

∂Sα
1
∂zα = B1 ⋆ κ ,

∂w1
∂zα = 0 ,

(4.24)

from which we see that B1 = C(x|y; Γi) is z-independent, and the background covariant derivative is deﬁned
by D0f := df + [Ω, f ]⋆, with Ω given by (4.22). If we make explicit the dependence on Γi in C as

we can see that D0C = 0 splits into

C(x|y; Γi) = Caux(x|y; Γ1) + Cdyn(x|y; Γ1) Γ2 ,

DLCaux + Γ1[e, Caux]⋆ = 0 , DLCdyn + Γ1{e, Cdyn}⋆ = 0 ,

(4.25)

(4.26)

where the Lorentz covariant derivative is DL := d + [ω,•]⋆ .
It is known [73] that the equation for Caux
describes non-propagating degrees of freedom, and Caux is indeed referred to as auxiliary. On the other
hand, by expanding the equation for Cdyn in power series in yα , one can see that Cdyn contains two real
AdS3 massless scalar ﬁelds together with all their on-shell nontrivial derivatives. At this stage, the next steps
would be to

(1) use ∂Sα

1

∂zα = C ⋆ κ to solve S1α in terms of C , up to some pure-gauge contribution;

(2) substitute for Sα

1 into ∂w1

∂zα = −D0S1α to solve the z-dependence of w1 in terms of C . One gets

w1 = ω1(x|y; Γi) + f1(x, z|y; Γi), where f1 is a known function linear in C ;

(3) use D0ω1 = −(cid:16)D0f1(cid:17)|z=0 as higher spin equation for ω1 .

It is known [74], however, that the linearized curvature D0ω1 does not receive nontrivial sources linear in C,
and indeed the higher spin ﬁelds do not propagate. For a more complete and thorough analysis of the 3D

equations, including the issue of ﬁeld redeﬁnition, locality and elimination of the auxiliary zero-form Caux up
to second order in the weak ﬁelds, see Ref. [75]. See also Ref. [76] for another review and exact solutions of

the PV equations.

Massive vacua. Let us study the model around a diﬀerent vacuum, namely B0 = ν Γ, where ν is a constant
and Γ is some element generated by the Γi , obeying Γ† = Γ and Γ2 = 1. The vacuum equations now read

dU0 + U0 ⋆ U0 = 0 ,

[Γ, U0] = 0 ,

[˜zα, Γ]⋆ = 0

[˜zα, U0]⋆ = 0 ,

[˜zα, ˜zβ]⋆ = −2i ǫαβ(cid:0)1 − ν Γκ(cid:1) ,

(4.27)

where we deﬁned ˜zα := S0α, that obey12 {˜zα, Γκ}⋆ = 0 and the deformed oscillator algebra. The strategy is
ﬁrst to ﬁnd a solution for ˜zα, and then solve [˜zα, U0]⋆ = 0 by ﬁnding other deformed variables ˜yα that star

12Since ˜zα commutes with Γ and anticommutes with κ from the necessary bosonic projection.

23

commute with ˜zα. To this end, let us introduce, as done in Ref. [8],

σα := νZ 1

0

dt t eityz(yα + zα) ,

τα := νZ 1

0

dt (t − 1) eityz(yα + zα) ,

with yz := yαzα. One can check that they obey the following relations:

[z[α, σβ]]⋆ = −iν ǫαβ κ ,
[zα, τβ]⋆ = {σα, yβ}⋆ ,

[σα, σβ ]⋆ = 0 ,
{y[α, τβ]}⋆ = iν ǫαβ ,

{σα, τβ}⋆ = 0 ,

[τα, τβ]⋆ = 0 .

Let us make the following Ansatz for the deformed oscillators:

˜zα = X zα + Y σα ,

˜yα = A yα + B τα ,

where X, Y , A and B are built out of gamma matrices Γi. By demanding

one has the following constraints,

[˜zα, ˜zβ]⋆ = −2iǫαβ(1 − νΓκ) ,

[˜yα, ˜zβ]⋆ = 0 ,

X 2 = 1 , XY = Y X = −Γ ,

[A, X] = {A, Y } = [B, X] = {B, Y } = 0 .

As in the original Prokushkin–Vasiliev model, we demand that ˜yα obey a deformed oscillator algebra:

This imposes

[˜yα, ˜yβ]⋆ = 2iǫαβ(cid:0)1 − ν Γ(cid:1) ,
{A, Γ} = 0 , A2 = 1 , AB = −BA = −Γ .

{˜yα, Γ} = 0 .

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

(4.32)

(4.33)

(4.34)

A convenient solution, that admits propagating degrees of freedom, is given by Γ = Γ1234

X = 1 ,

Y = −Γ , A = Γ1 , B = −Γ234 = −Γ1Γ ,

where we have chosen the number of generators of the Cliﬀord algebra to be N = 4 and Γi1..ik := Γ[i1 ..Γik].
With this solution, ﬁelds obeying [f, ˜zα]⋆ = 0 and [f, Γ] = 0 are given by f (x|˜y; Γij ), i.e. star functions of
the deformed ˜y’s and of all bilinears Γij, together with Γ itself, that is generated by bilinears. One can check
that undeformed sp(2, R) is still generated by ˜y’s as Tαβ := 1
4i{˜yα, ˜yβ}⋆, and one can take the background
connection U0 = Ω to be

Ω(x|˜y; Γij) =

1

4i(cid:16)ωαβ(x) ˜yα ⋆ ˜yβ + iΓ23 eαβ(x) ˜yα ⋆ ˜yβ(cid:17) = ω + iΓ23 e ,

such that dΩ + Ω⋆2 = 0 is solved by the AdS3 background. Fluctuations B1 deﬁned by B = ν Γ + B1 + ..
obey the linearized equations

(4.35)

[˜zα, B1]⋆ = 0 ⇒ B1 = C(x|˜y; Γij) , D0C = 0 ,

(4.36)

24

where, as before, D0f := df + [Ω, f ]⋆, but now with Ω given by (4.35). In order to ﬁnd the propagating
degrees of freedom, let us explicitate the Γij dependence of C:

C(x|˜y; Γij ) = Caux(x|˜y; Γ, iΓ23) + Cdyn(x|˜y; Γ, iΓ23)iΓ24 ,

and use it in the equation D0C = 0, obtaining

DLCaux + iΓ23 [e, Caux]⋆ = 0 , DLCdyn + iΓ23 {e, Cdyn}⋆ = 0 ,

(4.37)

(4.38)

from which one can ﬁnd that Cdyn contains four real massive propagating scalars, while Caux yields four
topological deformations. The analysis is now equivalent to the original Prokushkin–Vasiliev model, since at

this level one can identify

(k)PV = Γ ,

(ν)PV = −ν ,

(ρ)PV = Γ1 ,

(yα)PV = Γ1 yα ,

(zα)PV = Γ1 zα ,

(4.39)

One can truncate the master ﬁelds as

(ψ1)PV = iΓ23 ,

(ψ2)PV = iΓ24 .

Π+

Γ A = A , Π+

Γ B = B ,

with the projector Π+

Γ := 1±Γ
2

, yielding a model with two propagating scalars contained in

Cdyn(x|˜y; Γ, iΓ23) =

1 + Γ

2

C+(x|˜y; iΓ23) .

(4.40)

(4.41)

(4.42)

Minimal truncation. We now want to further truncate the matter sector contained in C+ to a single,
real scalar ﬁeld. By using the anti-automorphism deﬁned by

τ (f ⋆ g) = (−1)deg(f)deg(g)τ (g) ⋆ τ (f ) ,

τ (zα, dzα; yα, Γi) = (−izα,−idzα; iyα, ǫ(i)Γi) ,

ǫ(i) = (+, +,−,−) ,

one can truncate further, by requiring

τ (A) = −A ,

τ (B) = B .

(4.43)

(4.44)

(4.45)

This last truncation leaves a single real propagating scalar in the spectrum, since now the two chains of ﬁelds

multiplying 1 and iΓ23 only contain even and odd numbers of derivatives of the physical ﬁeld:

C+(x|˜y; iΓ23) =

∞Xn=0

C0

α1...α4n(x) ˜yα1 ...˜yα4n + iΓ23

∞Xn=0

C1

α1...α4n+2(x) ˜yα1 ...˜yα4n+2 .

(4.46)

Finally, it is possible to ﬁnd solution for the deformed oscillator algebra such that the deformed oscillators
obey the same reality conditions and transformation properties under the tau map as the undeformed yα
and zα , and therefore it is understood above that the master ﬁelds are expanded in terms of these deformed
oscillators.

25

4.2 Covariant Hamiltonian action

In this section we begin by discussing some generalities on covariant Hamiltonian actions on X4 × Z2. We
then determine the constraints on the Hamiltonian such that it leads to a master action in which the master

ﬁeld content, including the Lagrange multipliers, are extended to consist of sum of even and odd forms of

appropriate degree, and central elements. This action yields a generalized version of the PV ﬁeld equations.

Generalities.

In order to formulate the theory within the AKSZ framework [34] using its adaptation to

noncommutative higher spin geometries proposed in [35], we assume a formulation of the PV system that
treats Z2 as being closed and introduce an open six-manifold M6 with boundary

∂M6 = X3 × Z2 ,

(4.47)

where X3 is a closed manifold containing M3 as an open submanifold. On M6, we introduce a two-fold
duality extended [77, 6, 49] 13 set of diﬀerential forms given by

A = A[1] + A[3] + A[5] ,

B = B[0] + B[2] + B[4] ,

T = T[4] + T[2] + T[0] ,

S = S[5] + S[3] + S[1] ,

(4.48)

(4.49)

4 , C+

valued in A⊗C+
4 being the even subspace of the four dimensional Cliﬀord algebra, and where the subscript
denotes the form degree. The restriction to the even Cliﬀord subalgebra, i.e. to ﬁelds obeying [f (Γi), Γ] = 0,
is required by demanding integrability of the ﬁeld equations coming from the action that we will present in
the following. We let {J I} denote the generators of the ring of oﬀ-shell closed and central terms, i.e. elements
in the de Rham cohomology of M6 valued in the center of A ⊗ C+
(cid:2)J I , f(cid:3)⋆ = 0 ,
(oﬀ-shell) for any diﬀerential form f on M6 valued in A ⊗ C+
actions of the form

4 . Following the approach of [6], we consider

H(S, T ; A, B; J I ) = −S ⋆ [A, B]⋆ − T ⋆ A ⋆ A − V(S, T ; B; J I) .

(4.53)

13Starting from a universally Cartan integrable system and replacing each p-form by a sum of forms of degrees p, p + 2, . . . ,
p + 2N , and each structure constant by a function of oﬀ-shell closed and central terms, i.e. elements in the de Rham cohomology

valued in the center of the ﬁber algebra, with a decomposition into degrees 0, 2, . . . , 2N , yields a new universally Cartan

integrable system, referred to as the N -fold duality extension of the original system. More generally, one may consider on-shell

duality extensions by including on-shell closed complex-valued functionals into the extension of the structure constants [78, 49].

26

Thus, the coordinate and momentum master ﬁelds, deﬁned by

(X α; Pα) := (A, B; T, S) ,

(4.54)

lie in subspaces of A that are dually paired using TrA, which leads to distinct models depending on whether
In the reductions that follow, we shall consider the ﬁrst type of

4.3 Consistent truncations

In this section we review [4] the consistent truncation of the above covariant Hamiltonian master action in
six dimensions down to a BF -like model on X4 that reproduces Blencowe’s action. The truncation consists
in integrating out the ﬂuctuations in B around its vacuum expectation value followed by reductions on X4 .
Starting from the equations of motion (4.63) and setting B = 0 yields

and

F + g − h ⋆ µ ⋆ T = 0 ,

DT = 0 ,

DS + h ⋆ T + µ ⋆ S ⋆ S = 0 ,

(4.76)

(4.77)

which together form a Cartan integrable system containing (4.76) as a subsystem, i.e. the free diﬀerential
algebra generated by (A, T, S) contains a subalgebra generated by (A, T ). Assuming ∂M6 to consist of a
single component, it follows from S|∂M6 = 0 that S can be reconstructed from (A, T ) on-shell 16 from (4.77).
Therefore, the system (4.76) is a consistent truncation of the original system (4.63) on-shell.

Rewriting the full action (4.58) by integrating by parts in its SDB-term yields

SH =ZM6

TrA⊗C+

4 (cid:2)T ⋆ (F + g − 1

2 h ⋆ µ ⋆ T ) + B ⋆ (DS + h ⋆ T + µ ⋆ S ⋆ S)(cid:3) .

(4.78)

It follows that B = 0 is a saddle point of the path integral at which B and S can be integrated out in a

perturbative expansion. Schematically, modulo gauge ﬁxing, one has

and

T ⋆ (F + g − 1

2 h ⋆ µ ⋆ T ) .

(4.81)

The latter is a consistently reduced classical action in the sense that it reproduces the subsystem (4.76). The

reduced system, which thus consists of the gauge sector of the original system, is a topological theory with

local symmetries

and equations of motion and boundary conditions given by

δA = Dǫ + µ ⋆ h ⋆ η ,

δT = Dη − [ǫ, T ]⋆ ,

16 Since T |∂M6 = 0 on-shell as well it follows that both S and T can be taken to vanish on M6 on-shell.

F + g − µ ⋆ h ⋆ T = 0 , DT = 0 ,
T|∂M6 = 0 .

(4.82)

(4.83)

(4.84)

29

The boundary equations are thus given by

To address Blencowe’s theory, we truncate once more by reducing (4.76) under the assumptions that

(F + g)|∂M6 = 0 .

(4.85)

g = 0 , µ = µ[0] ≡ µ0 ,

h = J ,

where µ0 is an imaginary constant, and

A = ˇW[1] − ˇK[1] − µ0J ⋆ ˇK[1] ,

where we deﬁne checked ﬁelds to be z-independent: ˇf ∈ Ω(X4) ⊗ A ⊗ C+

T = ˇT[2] + ˇK[1] ⋆ ˇK[1] − µ0J ⋆ ˇT[2] ,
4 . By deﬁning

(4.86)

(4.87)

ˇF = dX ˇW + ˇW ⋆ ˇW ,

ˇD ˇK = dX ˇK + [ ˇW , ˇK]⋆ ,

ˇD ˇT = dX ˇT + [ ˇW , ˇT ]⋆ ,

(4.88)

and suppressing the subscripts indicating form degrees, the reduction of (4.76) yields

ˇF + ˇT = 0 ,

ˇD ˇT = 0 ,

D ˇK − ˇK ⋆ ˇK + ˇT = 0 ,

(4.89)

(4.90)

which is a Cartan integrable system containing (4.89) as a subsystem. From (4.84) and (4.87), we deduce

the boundary conditions

Substituting (4.87) into (4.81) and using (4.91) we obtain

ˇT|∂X4 = 0 = ( ˇK ⋆ ˇK)|∂X4 ,

ˇSred[ ˇW , ˇT ] = −µ0ZX4ZZ2

Truncation to the Prokushkin–Segal–Vasiliev action.

In the paper [4] that we are reviewing here,

another consistent truncation of the action (4.58) is shown to reproduce the action principle [79] for the PV
equation that is formulated in a 2-dimensional base space for the zα oscillators. The interested reader can
ﬁnd all the details in [4].

5 Higher spins and topological strings

In this section we shall argue, based on the formal structure of higher spin equations and actions, that higher

spin dynamics can be described in terms of ﬁrst-quantized topological open strings.

Vasiliev’s equations exhibit two basic properties akin to open string ﬁeld theory: First of all, we recall that

in Cartan’s formulation of ﬁeld theories, as free diﬀerential algebras, the spaces of forms in degrees one and

zero correspond to gauge Lie algebras and spectra of local degrees of freedom, respectively. In this respect,

a remarkable feature of Vasiliev’s higher spin gravities is that their one- and zero-form modules are uniﬁed
into associative algebras17. Second, they can be embedded into a Frobenius–Chern–Simons theory with a
cubic action principle that only refers to the trace and star product operations of the associative algebra

and a nilpotent diﬀerential containing the de Rham diﬀerential. These algebraic structures can be naturally

encoded into a class of two-dimensional Poisson sigma models with gauged supersymmetry, corresponding to

the de Rham operator, which are our candidate topological open string models.

In order to explain the rational behind these models in more detail, let us start from a particle on a
symplectic manifold N with symplectic potential one-form ϑ = dφαϑα and Hamiltonian H, consisting of

17 An interesting consequence is that the spectra of massless particles and generalized Type D solutions in four-dimensional
higher spin gravity are related by a Z2-symmetry [48], unlike in ordinary gauge theories, in which the Type D solution spaces

are ﬁnite dimensional.

31

constraints and Lagrange multipliers, as described by an action of the form

Sϑ =ZC

(ϑ − H) ,

integrated along a worldline C. Assigning physical states of the system to Hilbert spaces it is natural

to consider open worldlines whose boundaries are allowed to ﬂuctuate in Lagrangian submanifolds of N .

Alternatively, and more generally, one may assign the physical states to density matrices, in which case it

is natural to take C to be closed, and choose boundary conditions such that the path integral provides a
trace operation. Considering initially the case of a trivial Hamiltonian, and letting Παβ denote the Poisson
bi-vector on N , i.e. the inverse of the symplectic two-form ωαβ = ∂αϑβ − ∂βϑα, the resulting path integral
over worldlines C can be extended into a path integral over open worldsheets Σ with boundary C, weighted
by exp i

 SΠ where SΠ is the action of the Ikeda–Schaller–Strobl Poisson sigma model

SΠ =ZΣ

(ηα ∧ dφα + 1

2 Παβηα ∧ ηβ) ,

subject to the boundary condition ηα|C = 0. (which can be derived on-shell using the variational principle but
that actually must be imposed oﬀ-shell as well in order for the classical Batalin–Vilkovisky master equation

to hold). The resulting path integral can be performed in two steps: First over discs with a point of C
attached to a ﬁxed point p0 ∈ N (which one may think of as a (D − 1)-brane), and then by integrating over
p0 using the symplectic measure. Inserting vertex operators along points pi ∈ C, given by (the pull-back of)
i fi, where f ⋆ g
is an associative noncommutative product, referred to as the star product. Provided that f and g belong

functions fi on N , the resulting path integral can be viewed as a formal deﬁnition of TrNQ⋆

to suﬃciently smooth classes of functions (e.g. polynomials or formal power series with coeﬃcients given by

power series in ), then the star product has an expansion in terms of pointwise derivatives, viz.

f ⋆ g = f g + i{f, g} + ··· ,

{f, g} := Παβ∂αf ∂βg ,

where the higher order terms in the  expansion are given in terms of multiple derivatives of the functions

and the Poisson structure (but not its inverse), while in order to compose more general elements, including

(nonperturbative) distributions on N and (which arise as density matrices related to unitary representations),

nonlocal versions of the star product, based on auxiliary integrations, are required. Unlike the particle action,
the Poisson sigma model remains well-deﬁned on Poisson manifolds, where Παβ is assumed to be a bi-vector
obeying

Πδ[α∂δΠβγ] = 0 ,

as this ensures the invariance of the action under ηα gauge transformations, while there is no requirement on
its invertibility.

Historically, the existence of a star product on general symplectic manifolds was ﬁrst established formally

by De Wilde and Lecomte [80]. Its pointwise form was given explicitly and on a manifestly covariant form

by Fedosov [81]. His construction resembles that of Vasiliev, though it does not provide any dynamics, which

instead will require a suitable gauging leading to topological open strings, as we shall propose below. Later,

32

Kontsevich used his formality theorem to show the existence and uniqueness (up to similarity transformations

and changes of basis corresponding to diﬀerent ordering schemes) of the star product on general Poisson
manifolds. He also provided an explicit formula in the case of N ∼= Rn, derived soon after by means of
perturbative AKSZ quantization of the Poisson sigma model by Cattaneo and Felder [82], who also provided

a globally deﬁned star product for any (N, Π) in [83].

In order to spell out our proposal, we need one more basic ingredient of Vasiliev’s models and their

FCS generalizations.

In addition to the aforementioned fusion of their Cartan modules into associative

ﬁber algebras, their simplicity relies on yet one more uniﬁcation, namely of spacetime and noncommutative

symplectic manifolds into extended base manifolds of Poisson type so as to facilitate the construction of closed

and central two-forms whose star products with the zero-form provide (nontrivial) co-cycles for the curvatures.

The resulting framework is that of diﬀerential Poisson manifolds, which are natural generalizations of Poisson

manifolds on which classes of diﬀerential forms (and distributions) in diﬀerent degrees, and not just functions,

can be equipped by star products by deforming the classical wedge product along diﬀerential Poisson brackets.

In the case of suﬃciently smooth objects, the resulting pointwise star product reads

where the diﬀerential Poisson bracket, that now involves the bi-vector as well as a compatible connection, is
of the form18

f ⋆ g = f ∧ g + i{f, g} + ··· ,

(5.1)

β is the curvature of the connection shifted by the torsion. When written
on the above form, the bracket is graded skew-symmetric, of vanishing intrinsic degree, compatible with

{ω, η} = Παβ ∇αω ∧ ∇βη + (−1)deg(ω) eRαβ ∧ iαω ∧ iβη ,
γ and eRα

where eRαβ = ΠαγeRα

the de Rham diﬀerential and obeying Leibniz rule, while the graded Jacobi identity requires the additional

(5.3)

(5.4)

By extending the formality theorem to the graded supermanifold with coordinates (φα, θα) (see [46] for

a related discussion), the -expansion of the star product can be determined together with a nilpotent

operator, given by an -deformation of the de Rham diﬀerential, by requiring associativity and compatibility.

In particular, in degree zero, the star product must yield Cattaneo and Felder’s manifestly covariant form of

Kontsevich product (which in its turn reproduces Fedosov’s product in the symplectic case).

Motivated by the above considerations, it was proposed in [1] that the diﬀerential star product algebra can

be obtained by perturbative quantization of the supersymmetric two-dimensional topological sigma model

based on the (classical) action

S =ZΣ(cid:16)ηα ∧ dφα + χα ∧ ∇θα + 1

2 Παβηα ∧ ηβ + 1

γδ χγ ∧ χδ(cid:17) .

4 θαθβeRαβ

18Strictly speaking, there remains one possible tensorial deformation; see [1] for a more detailed form of the Poisson bracket.
19The quadratic constraint on the curvature tensor is a Yang–Baxter equation and the two-dimensional diﬀerential Poisson

(5.5)

sigma model can thus be used as a framework for associative algebras including Hopf algebras.

33

Indeed, the conditions on the background ﬁelds required by the Jacobi identity, as listed above, can equiv-

alently be derived by requiring the appropriate two-dimensional gauge symmetries, which serve to gauge
away all local degrees of freedom except the constant modes in φα and θα. Moreover, the coeﬃcient of the
four-fermi coupling is ﬁxed by the requirement that the action has a global nilpotent supersymmetry given

by

δf φα = θα ,

δf θα = 0,

δf ηα = 1

δf χα = −ηα + Γγ

2eRβγ

This transformations can be identiﬁed as an avatar for the de Rham diﬀerential upon representing the forms
on N as functions on the parity shifted bundle T [1]N coordinatized by (φα, θα). It can be shown that the
model can be reformulated on more general (n|n) supermanifolds equipped with super Poisson bi-vectors.
The global symmetries of this model, which include the original Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds as well as more

general super Killing vectors, such as δf , can be gauged.

The special case of gauging of δf was studied in [13]. It remains to be examined whether it is consistent at
the quantum level, which may require extra conditions on diﬀerential Poisson geometry (e.g. its Ricci tensor),

though the absence of obstructions at the ﬁrst sub-leading order in  [46] suggests their absence to all orders

in perturbation theory. Assuming quantum consistency, it is natural to propose that ﬁnite deformations of

the background can be modelled by a topological open string ﬁeld Ψ obeying

{Q, Ψ}⋆ + Ψ ⋆ Ψ = 0 ,

(5.8)

where the BRST operator Q contains a sector that gauges the de Rham diﬀerential acting on the zero-modes
of φα. We claim that the FCS formulation of four-dimensional higher spin gravity in twistor space can
be obtained by a reduction of the above system down to a ﬁnite set of modes describing stretched strings,
whereas in order to obtain the minimal bosonic models20 based on vector oscillators one has to gauge the
additional sp(2) Killing vectors generated by the moment functions of the conformal particle.

Finally, let us remark on the connection to tensionless strings in anti-de Sitter spacetime. To this end, it

is important that the associative algebras in higher spin gravity are of a special type related to singletons.

These algebras can be realized either via the group algebras (or enveloping algebras) of the underlying ﬁnite-
dimensional isometry groups or oscillator algebras over ideals given by singleton annihilators 21, which can
be thought of as the equations of motions for conformal particles on the embedding space of anti-de Sitter

spacetime. Thus one may view the topological open string as the germ of a tensionless string, consisting

of two string partons orbiting (as conformal particles) around a center-of-mass. Indeed, similar excitations,

carrying the quantum numbers of singletons, are known to arise in the form of cusps on tensionful closed

20These models are known as the D-dimensional Type A models. The D-dimensional Type B models should arise in a similar

fashion from gauging an osp(1|2) algebra.

21The topological open string approach may be useful in further elucidating the whether there exist two dual underlying
ﬁrst-quantized formulations, one on the group manifold, thought of as a Poisson manifold, and another one directly on the

singleton phase space, thought of as a symplectic manifold.

34

boconic strings in D-dimensional anti-de Sitter space time in the semi-classical limit (described by soliton

solutions of the of the Nambu–Goto action). Thus, as proposed in [41], one may think of the Hagedorn

transition in ﬂat spacetime as switching on a small negative cosmological constant whereby the cyclically

ordered one-string states of tensionful strings break up in the tensionless limit into totally symmetric multi-

singleton states. In particular, on physical grounds, long (folded) string states, which thus connect two cusps

at the opposite side of the center-of-mass (with closed worldlines in periodic anti-de Sitter spacetime), should

remain self-interacting in this limit, at least in the classical limit of the string ﬁeld theory, and admit a

ﬁrst-quantized description as an sp(2)-gauged topological open bosonic string with en eﬀective ﬁeld theory

description in terms of minimal bosonic higher spin gravity.

In summary, one further piece of motivation for studying topological open strings of the type proposed

above is thus that they may provide a link between higher spin gravity and tensionless strings in anti-de Sitter

spacetime, and possibly also a glimpse of what one might expect from a background independent formulation

of closed string ﬁeld theory.
