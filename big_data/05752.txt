Abstract—Burstable billing is widely adopted in practice, e.g., by colo-
cation data center providers, to charge for their users, e.g. data centers,
for transferring data. However, there is still a lack of research on what the
best way is for a user to manage its workload in response to burstable
billing. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel method to
optimally respond to burstable billing under demand uncertainty. First,
we develop a tractable mathematical expression to calculate the 95th
percentile usage of a user, who is charged by a provider via burstable
billing for bandwidth usage. This model is then used to formulate a new
bandwidth allocation problem to maximize the user’s surplus, i.e., its net
utility minus cost. Additionally, we examine different non-convex solution
methods for the formulated stochastic optimization problem. We also
extend our design to the case where a user can receive service from
multiple providers, who all employ burstable billing. Using real-world
workload traces, we show that our proposed method can reduce user’s
bandwidth cost by 26% and increase its total surplus by 23%, compared
to the current practice of allocating bandwidth on-demand.

Index Terms—Burstable billing, bandwidth, demand uncertainty, non-
linear mixed-integer programming, surplus maximization.

1 INTRODUCTION

B URSTABLE billing,

is a smart data pricing (SDP)
method that is used in practice, e.g., by Internet ser-
vice providers, to charge for transferring data [1], [2], [3],
[4]. Recently, burstable billing is also widely adopted by
Colocation Data Center (CDC) providers, e.g., Creative
Data Concepts [5], NetSource Communications [6] and
Co-Location.com [7], as a means to charge their users
for bandwidth usage. According to Colocation America,
bandwidth billing has become the second largest aspect
of CDC users’ overall costs, second to energy billing [8].
Under burstable billing, the provider, who provides
its users with links for data transferring, will measure

each of its user’s usage of bandwidth based on the
user’s peak usage at a certain percentile, often at the
95th percentile usage. By construction, burstable billing
neglects the user’s usage of bandwidth during any time
other than period of peak use. Hence, burstable billing
allows users to exceed their usage thresholds for a short
period without facing ﬁnancial penalty [3].

In general, burstable billing can be studied from two
different viewpoints: provider’s and user’s. For studies
that address burstable billing from the provider’s view-
point [2], [3], [9], [10], a common strategy is for the
provider to move different users’ workloads across space
and time to avoid coinciding their peak usages, thus,
reducing the overall peak demand for bandwidth [10].
However, whether or not users are willing to modulate
their workloads is often overlooked.

The studies that address burstable billing from the
user’s perspective have emerged only recently. So far,
due to the lack of a tractable mathematical expression
to calculate the 95th percentile usage of bandwidth, a
common approach has been to use experimental and/or
heuristic methods, e.g., as in [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
[16]. There are also few studies that are analytical; how-
ever, they assume that the workload has a speciﬁed dis-
tribution, e.g., Gaussian distribution [17], or they focus
on peak pricing, i.e., the 100 percentile billing instead of
95 percentile billing [18], or they assume that the cost of
bandwidth is volume-based [19], [20].

In this paper, as illustrated by Fig. 1, we are interested

ClientsData Center (User)Our FocusCDC ProviderWorkloads$Bandwidth$Via Burstable Billingin studying burstable billing from the user’s viewpoint by
taking into consideration the trade-off between cost and
performance based on user’s preferences. Speciﬁcally,
we seek to answer this fundamental question: What is
the best way for an individual user, such as a data center
in a CDC, who is charged via burstable billing, to manage
its operation and the use of bandwidth? Our approach to
answer this question is based on formulating and solving
an optimization problem for bandwidth usage which
aims at maximizing the user’s surplus, i.e., its net utility
minus cost.

We take into consideration the fact that, in practice,
neither the user nor the provider have perfect knowledge
about the workload, and thus the demand for bandwidth
in the future. For example, when it comes to a user in
a CDC as in Fig. 1, the workload is initiated by the
user’s clients, not the user itself. Therefore, in our anal-
ysis, we address demand uncertainty within a stochastic
optimization framework.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper
to study the problem of optimal responding to
burstable billing from a single user’s viewpoint un-
der demand uncertainty with arbitrary probability
distributions.

2) To facilitate the use of systematic optimization, we
develop a tractable mathematical expression to cal-
culate the 95th percentile usage of bandwidth. This
model is then used to formulate a novel bandwidth
allocation problem to maximize the user’s surplus.
Additionally, we examine different solution meth-
ods to ﬁnd the exact and near-optimal solutions of
the formulated problem.

3) We extend our design as well to another emerging
practical scenario where a user can receive service
from multiple providers, e.g., when a user can
request content it needs from multiple providers
that all employ burstable billing. Accordingly, our
problem formulation also addresses workload dis-
tribution in addition to bandwidth allocation.

4) We evaluate our design based on a real-world
workload trace: Wikipedia Page View data [21].
With a typical workload forecasting method, we
show that the use of our design is particularly
rewarding if a user is charged by high bandwidth
price and/or it is more sensitive to price than to
performance. Finally, we also show the advantage
of utilizing services from multiple providers, where
we can further increase the user’s surplus by dis-
tributing its workload to multiple providers that
employ burstable billing.

2 PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, we formulate a mathematical expression
for a user’s 95th percentile usage, which is a key concept
in burstable billing. This model is then used to obtain

2

Fig. 2. An example for calculating the 95th percentile
usage: a total of 8640 samples are collected for a user
during one billing cycle. After throwing away the top 5%,
i.e., 5 ∗ 8640/100 = 432 samples, the 95th percentile
usage is obtained as 399.1277 Mbps, which is equal to
the highest recorded bandwidth usage of the remaining
95∗ 8640/100 = 8208 samples. The 95th percentile usage
is shown by the red line. Here, the user is allowed to have
a total of 432 bursts above the red line without facing
ﬁnancial penalty.

the user’s expected bandwidth cost and surplus prior to
a billing cycle.

2.1 95th Percentile Usage
In order to apply burstable billing, a provider ﬁrst
divides a billing cycle into τ time intervals of equal
length T . The length of time intervals could be as low
as 30 seconds, though typically the time intervals of
T = 5 minuets are considered [2]. Next, to obtain a
user’s 95th percentile usage, the provider takes samples
of the user’s usage of bandwidth, e.g., once every ﬁve
minutes during that billing cycle. Then, the top 5% of
the samples gathered within the billing cycle are thrown
away and the highest element of the remaining 95%
samples is taken as the user’s 95th percentile usage. An
example for calculating the 95th percentile usage is shown
in Fig. 2. Similarly, the user can obtain its own 95th
percentile usage, denoted by µ95(x[t]), given the usage
samples x[1],··· , x[τ ] from the mathematical expression
provided in the following theorem:

Theorem 1: Given x[t], ∀t = 1, . . . , τ as the τ samples
of the bandwidth usage for a user during a billing cycle,
we can model the 95th percentile usage for that user as

the values in array x[1], . . . , x[τ ], and (cid:98)ρ[t] = 1 otherwise.

which in this case, Theorem 1 holds. Next, we note

is the optimal solution of problem (1), where for at least

that (cid:98)ρ[1], . . . ,(cid:98)ρ[τ ] is a feasible solution to problem (1).
To complete the proof, we show that (cid:98)ρ[1], . . . ,(cid:98)ρ[τ ] is in
one time slot t, we have ˜ρ[t] (cid:54)= (cid:98)ρ[t]. Due to the equality
from (cid:98)ρ[1], . . . ,(cid:98)ρ[τ ] only if there exists a time slot t for

constraint in (1), 95% of the variables in ˜ρ[1], . . . , ˜ρ[τ ] are
equal to one. Therefore, ˜ρ[1], . . . , ˜ρ[τ ] could be different

which ˜ρ[t] = 1 even though x[t] is within the top 5% of
the values in array x[1], . . . , x[τ ]. In that case, we must
have

{x[t]˜ρ[t]} ≥ max

t

Also, since ˜ρ[1], . . . , ˜ρ[τ ] is assumed to be the optimal
solution of problem (1), by deﬁnition of optimality, we
must have

{x[t]˜ρ[t]} ≤ max

ρ[t] in problem (1) is an auxiliary variable. For each
time slot t, if ρ[t] = 0, it indicates that its correspond-
ing usage, x[t],
is within the top 5% of the values
in x[1], . . . , x[τ ], thus, x[t] has no impact on the 95th
percentile usage µ95(x[t]), i.e., the user can utilize band-
width on-demand without extra cost. On the contrary, if
ρ[t] = 1, the user may restrict its usage at this time slot
to reduce its 95th percentile usage.

2.2 Cost of Bandwidth under Burstable Billing
Next, we formulate the user’s bandwidth cost given
the bandwidth usage samples x[1], . . . , x[τ ] based on
burstable billing as

C95(x[t]) = δ · µ95(x[t]),

(6)

where δ ($/Mbps) denotes the price of bandwidth under
burstable billing. Note, the price of bandwidth δ can vary
with the length of billing cycle. However, in this paper,
we assume that the length of each billing cycle is ﬁxed,
i.e., the price of bandwidth δ is constant.

2.3 Expected Surplus Prior to a Billing Cycle
Consider a user that aims to plan for its bandwidth
usage prior to a billing cycle. A key question is how to
model the expected surplus, i.e., net utility minus cost,
under uncertain demand. Therefore, in this section we

that
(cid:4)

formulate the user’s expected net utility and surplus
prior to a billing cycle.

Let D[t] (Mbps) be the user’s demand for bandwidth
at time slot t, which is the amount of bandwidth user
needs to fully satisfy its clients, i.e., to obtain the highest
net utility. Note that, the user may not know its exact
demand in the future, rather has a distribution for its
demand, i.e., D[t] is a random variable. Next, we note
that the user may not always choose to serve its full
demand for bandwidth at a given time. Let X[t] (Mbps)
be the planned usage of bandwidth during time interval
t = 1, . . . , τ for the user prior to the billing cycle. Here,
the planned usage of bandwidth X[t] is decided based on
the demand D[t].

We assume a general net utility function in this paper
that depends only on user’s bandwidth usage. At each
time slot t, the utility function U (·) is a concave and non-
decreasing function of the total bandwidth, as in [22],
[23]. However, the user cannot gain any extra utility by
using more bandwidth than its demand. Therefore, for a
billing cycle, we formulate the user’s expected net utility
as

R =

E(U (T min{X[t], D[t]}))

From the optimization-based model in (1), one can
calculate the 95th percentile usage for each billing cycle,
which is denoted by µ95(X[t]), as a function of planned
usage samples X[1], . . . , X[τ ]. Further, the corresponding
bandwidth cost at each billing cycle can be calculated
via (6).

From (6) and (7), the user’s expected surplus, i.e., its
expected net utility minus its bandwidth cost during a
billing cycle, is obtained as

S =

E (U (T min{X[t], D[t]})) − δ · µ95(X[t]).

3 SURPLUS MAXIMIZATION
In this section, we aim to optimally plan the user’s
bandwidth usage prior to a billing cycle to achieve
the highest surplus. In other words, we formulate the
problem to obtain the optimal planned usage so as to
maximize the expected surplus. Typically, neither the user
nor the provider have perfect knowledge about the
user’s demand for bandwidth in an upcoming billing
cycle, i.e., D[1], . . . , D[τ ] are often uncertain. Here, we
assume that the predictions of user’s demand D[t] are
given, which could be either deterministic values or
stochastic probability functions. Accordingly, we formu-
late the optimization problems of maximizing the user’s
surplus prior to a billing cycle under deterministic and
stochastic prediction of D[t].

4.1 Deterministic Problem
For the deterministic problem (9), we can intuitively
obtain the optimal solution for variables ρ[1], . . . , ρ[τ ]
without numerically solving the problem. This property
can be expressed mathematically in the following theo-
rem.

Theorem 2: Let ϑ denote the set of all time slots t
at which D[t] is within the top 5% of the values in
D[1], . . . , D[τ ].

(a) There exists an optimal solution for the determinis-
tic problem (9) in which the values of auxiliary variables
ρ[1], . . . , ρ[τ ] are as follows:

ρ(cid:63)[t] =

0, ∀t ∈ ϑ;
1, otherwise.

(12)

(cid:40)

(b) Once the optimal values of ρ in the deterministic
problem (9) are replaced from (12), the solution for the
principal variables X[1], . . . , X[τ ] of the deterministic
problem (9) are obtained from the following convex
optimization problem:

ρ(cid:63)[t]X[t]

t=1

0 ≤ X[t] ≤ D[t], ∀t,

(13)

where ρ(cid:63)[t] is given by (12).

Proof: First, one can easily ﬁnd that the objective func-
tion in the deterministic problem (9) is a non-increasing
function of X[t], when X[t] ≥ D[t]. Therefore, the opti-
mization problem (9) can be reformulated as

τ(cid:88)

∀t,

(14)

Next, we note that ρ(cid:63)[t] in (12) is a feasible solution for
the problem (14). Let ¯ϑ denote the complement set of ϑ,
i.e., ¯ϑ = {1, . . . , τ} − ϑ. Let ρc[t] denote the true optimal
solution of ρ[t] for the problem (14). The solution of
usage X (cid:63)[t], obtained from (14) by setting ρ[t] = ρ(cid:63)[t],
is as follows:

(cid:40)

∀t ∈ ϑ;
D[t],
min{µ(cid:63), D[t]}, ∀t ∈ ¯ϑ,

3.1 Surplus Maximization with Deterministic Predic-
tion
If the prediction of demand for bandwidth is determinis-
tic, i.e., parameters D[1], . . . , D[τ ] are deterministic, from
(1) and (8), we formulate the optimization problem to
maximize the user’s surplus over a billing cycle as:

τ(cid:88)

τ(cid:88)

max
X[t],ρ[t]

s.t.

t=1

X[t] ≥ 0,
ρ[t] ∈ {0, 1},

ρ[t] = (cid:100)0.95τ(cid:101).

U (T min{X[t], D[t]}) − δ max

t

ρ[t]X[t]

∀t,
∀t,

(9)

t=1
is the principal variable while ρ[t]

Here, X[t]
is the
auxiliary variable that is used to calculate the expected
95th percentile usage as explained in Theorem 1. Note that,
since the net utility function does not depend on the
auxiliary variable ρ[t], and also because price parameter
δ is nonnegative, if the principal variable X[t] is set to
be ﬁxed, then the maximization in (9) over X[t] and ρ[t]
reduces to the minimization in (1) over ρ[t]. Therefore, it
is guaranteed that once we solve the problem in (9), the
choice of auxiliary variable ρ[t] is automatically selected
in a way that µ95(X[t]) is calculated as in (1).

3.2 Surplus Maximization with Stochastic Prediction
Another common approach in addressing uncertainty
is to obtain a probability mass function [24] for each
random parameter using historical workload data. This
can be done in various levels of details and accuracy, e.g.,
see [25]. In such case, we assume that each D[t] shall be
expressed by Kt possible realizations: D1[t], . . . , DKt[t],
where each realization Dk[t] may occur with probability
πk,t. We have

πk,t = 1,

∀t.

(10)

Kt(cid:88)

Once we use the above modeling method, we can then
formulate the stochastic optimization problem to maximize
the user’s expected surplus over a billing cycle as:

4 SOLUTION METHOD
Both problems (9) and (11) are nonlinear, mixed-integer
programmings, which are generally considered to be
hard problems to solve. Nevertheless, in this section,
we explain how these problems can be solved with
reasonable computational complexities.

where µ(cid:63) is the optimal 95th percentile usage of bandwidth
corresponding to X (cid:63)[t].

To complete the proof of theorem we only need to
show that ρc[t] = ρ(cid:63)[t]. Next, We prove by contradiction
that this argument indeed holds. In other words, if we
assume that ρc[t] (cid:54)= ρ(cid:63)[t], then the user’s total surplus
with ρc[t] will be less than the user’s surplus with ρ(cid:63)[t].

Let ρc[t] (cid:54)= ρ(cid:63)[t] so that:

(cid:40)

0, ∀t ∈ ν;
1. ∀t ∈ ¯ν,

ρc[t] =

(16)
where ν is some set so that ν (cid:54)= ϑ and ¯ν is the
complement set of ν. This assumption implies that, for
at least one time slot t ∈ ν, D[t] is not within the top 5%
of the values in array D[1], . . . , D[τ ]. The optimal usage
of bandwidth X c[t] in this case becomes

X c[t] =

∀t ∈ ν
D[t],
min{µc, D[t]}, ∀t ∈ ¯ν,

(17)

(cid:40)

where µc is the optimal 95th percentile usage of bandwidth
corresponding to X c[t].
We prove that µc ≤ maxt∈ ¯ϑ D[t]. Considering a scenario
where the user plans to utilize bandwidth on-demand,
i.e., ∀t ∈ {1, . . . , τ}, X[t] = D[t]. In this case, the 95th per-
centile usage of bandwidth becomes maxt∈ ¯ϑ D[t], which
is obviously the highest feasible 95th percentile usage of
bandwidth of problem (14). Thus, µc ≤ maxt∈ ¯ϑ D[t].
Then, we prove that (X (cid:63)[t], ρ(cid:63)[t]) is the optimal solutions
of problem (14). Let

∀t ∈ ϑ;
D[t],
min{µc, D[t]}, ∀t ∈ ¯ϑ.

X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t] =

(18)
Since µc ≤ maxt∈ ¯ϑ D[t], maxt X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t]ρ(cid:63)[t] = µc. Namely,
with (X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t], ρ(cid:63)[t]), the 95th percentile usage of bandwidth
equals µc. In this case, we have

(cid:40)

C95(X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t]) = C95(X c[t]) = δ · µc.

Also, from (7), we have

R(X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t]) =

U (T D[t]) +

and

R(X c[t]) =

U (T D[t]) +

U (T min{µc, D[t]}). (21)

Let f (D[t]) = U (T D[t]) − U (T min{µc, D[t]}). From (20)
and (21), we calculate R(X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t])−R(X c[t]), which equals
to

f (D[t]) − (cid:88)

f (D[t]).

(22)

t∈ν−ϑ

Next, note that f (D[t]) is in fact equal to:

U (T D[t]) − U (T µc),
0,

if D[t] ≥ µc;
otherwise.

f (D[t]) =

(23)
Since U (·) is nondecreasing and T ≥ 0, from (23), f (D[t])
is nondecreasing, too.
Then, we can ﬁnd that

D[t1] ≥ D[t2] ∀t1 ∈ ϑ − ν, ∀t2 ∈ ν − ϑ.

(24)

From (22) and (24) and since f (D[t]) is nondecreasing
over D[t] and (cid:107)ϑ − ν(cid:107) = (cid:107)ν − ϑ(cid:107), we have

R(X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t]) ≥ R(X c[t]).

From (19) and (25),
the obtained surplus with
(X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t], ρ(cid:63)[t]) is no less than the one with (X c[t], ρc[t]).
Since X (cid:63)[t] is the optimal solution of X[t] of problem
(14) corresponding to ρ(cid:63)[t], the obtained surplus with
(X (cid:63)[t], ρ(cid:63)[t]) is no less than the one with (X (cid:63)(cid:63)[t], ρ(cid:63)[t]).
Therefore, the obtained surplus with (X (cid:63)[t], ρ(cid:63)[t]) is no
less than the one with (X c[t], ρc[t]). Since (X c[t], ρc[t])
was assumed to be optimal, (X (cid:63)[t], ρ(cid:63)[t]) is an optimal
(cid:4)
solution of problem (14).

From Theorem 2, one can convert the non-convex
problem (9) onto a convex program (13), which can be
effectively solved using convex programming techniques
[26].

4.2 Stochastic Problem
If parameters D[1], . . . , D[τ ] are random, then we do not
know at what time slots the burst will occur in the de-
mand for bandwidth. Accordingly, we cannot separately
ﬁgure out the optimal values of ρ[1], . . . , ρ[τ ]. Therefore,
we have no choice but solving the original stochastic
problem (11).

A key difﬁculty in solving the stochastic problem (11)
is that even if we relax the binary constraints, i.e., even
if we choose ρ[t] to be a continuous number between 0
and 1, the relaxed problem is still difﬁcult to solve due
to the non-convex term ρ[t]X[t] in the objective function.
Interestingly, we can tackle this undesirable property as
it is explained in a theorem below.

where L is a large number compared to the available
bandwidth, and φ is another auxiliary variable.
Proof: At each time slot t, if ρ[t] = 0, then the ﬁrst
constraint in problem (26) reduces to X[t] ≤ φ + L, ∀t,
which always holds regardless of the values of X[t] and
φ. If ρ[t] = 1, then the ﬁrst constraint in (26) reduces to
X[t] ≤ φ, ∀t. In that case, since the objective function
in (26) is to minimize φ, we necessarily obtain that
φ = maxt ρ[t]X[t] at any optimal solution of problem
(cid:4)
(26). This is clearly an outcome that we intended.

Given the equivalence of the stochastic problem (11)
and (26), we can solve problem (26) instead of (11).
Next, we notice that from (26), once we relax the binary
constraints, the relaxed problem is convex. Therefore, we
can ﬁnd the exact optimal solution of problem (26) using
branch-and-bound method [27], where at each branching

We refer to this approach as the convex branch-and-
bound (CBB) method.

While the CBB method is effective to obtain the exact
optimal solution of the stochastic problem (11), solving
a nonlinear (although convex) problem at each iteration
of the branch-and-bound algorithm could be time con-
suming. Since the nonlinearity in problem (26) is due
to the nonlinear utility function U (·), one way to make
problem (26) linear is to replace U (·) with its piece-wise
linear approximation. This is explained in the following
theorem.

Theorem 4: Let N denote the number of tangent lines
in the piece-wise linear approximation of the utility
function U (·). If N → ∞, then the problem in (26)
is equivalent to the mixed-integer linear optimization

by terminating the optimization solver at certain guar-
anteed optimality bounds in order to signiﬁcantly lower
computational complexity. We will further discuss this
option in Section 6.2.

5 EXTENSIONS AND REMARKS
In this section, we discuss two interesting analysis with
regards to the proposed design. First, we extend our
design to a scenario where a user has the option to
receive service from multiple providers. An example is
a user can download speciﬁed content over different
transit links that is owned by different ISPs, who charge
the user via burstable billing. Second, we show in this
section that a user can further improve its surplus by
updating the usage of bandwidth in real-time, i.e. during
the billing cycle, based on the newly exposed actual
demand information.

5.1 Extension to Multiple Providers
Let Xi[t] denote the planned usage of bandwidth at
provider i at time slot t decided based on the user’s
demand D[t]. Let δi ($/Mbps) denote the price of band-
width at provider i. In this case, in each billing cycle,
the expected surplus of the user with multiple providers
is obtained as

We can also formulate a user’s optimization of the us-
age at multiple providers to achieve maximum expected
surplus under stochastic prediction of the demand D[t]

(27)
where n = 1, . . . , N. Here, Qk[t] and hk[t] are auxiliary
variables for tangent line k.
Proof: As it can be seen from (27), we ﬁrst replace
min{X[t], Dk[t]} in the objective function of (26) with an
auxiliary variable Qk[t]. Here, Qk[t] is upper bounded
by X[t] and Dk[t], which is exactly the type of constraint
that we need to model the min function min{X[t], Dk[t]}.
Next, the concave function U (T Qk[t]) is replaced by a
new variable hk[t]. Also, as in the last constraint in (27),
hk[t] is upper bounded by N number of tangents lines to
the concave curve U (T Qk[t]). Therefore, if N → ∞, hk[t]
is equivalent to U (T Qk[t]). Accordingly, the problem
formulation in (27) becomes equivalent to the one in (26).
(cid:4)

The usefulness of problem (27) depends on the choice
of parameter N. However, as we will see in Section
6.2, we can obtain the near exact optimal solution of
the stochastic surplus maximization problem even if
N = 3. There exist effective solvers to solve mixed-
integer linear programming (MILP), such as CPLEX [28].
We will see in Section 6.2 that solving the MILP in (27)
is computationally more tractable than the CBB method.
Before we end this section, we must point out that
one can obtain an approximate solution for problem (27)

t=1

(29)
A special case of problem in (29) is where ∀t, Kt = 1
and πk,t = 1, i.e., the case where the prediction of user’s
demand is deterministic and problem (29) reduces to
a deterministic optimization. Note that, for the case of
multiple providers, the exact solution of the optimization
in (18), even for the deterministic optimization, cannot
be obtained from the method discussed in Theorem 2.
Therefore, for the solution of the problem in (18), as in
Section 4.2, we transform the nonlinear mixed-integer

ρ[t] = 1, the user restricts its usage at this times slot to
reduce its 95th percentile usage. Speciﬁcally, when ρ[t] = 1,
if ¯D[t] ≤ µ95(X[t]), the user can utilize bandwidth on-
demand, and if ¯D[t] > µ95(X[t]), the user needs to
restrict its utilization of bandwidth to ensure that its
95th percentile usage equals to µ95(X[t]). On the contrary,
the user can always utilize bandwidth on-demand when
ρ[t] = 0 since the usage at this time slot has no impact
on the 95th percentile usage. Therefore, we formulate the
user’s updated usage of bandwidth at each time slot
during a cycle, which is denoted by ¯X[t], as

(cid:40) ¯D[t],

¯X[t] =

µ95(X[t]), otherwise.

if ρ[t] = 0 or ¯D[t] ≤ µ95(X[t]);

(30)
From (30), we ensure that ∀t, ¯X[t] ≤ ¯D[t]. Similar to (7)
and (8), after a billing cycle, the net utility with updated
usage values ¯X[1], . . . , ¯X[τ ] can be calculated as

¯R =

U (T ¯X[t]).

(31)

τ(cid:88)

t=1

τ(cid:88)

Further, from (1), (6) and (31), we formulate the user’s
surplus with updated usage values ¯X[1], . . . , ¯X[τ ] via

¯S =

U (T ¯X[t]) − δ · µ95( ¯X[t]).

(32)

t=1

We can show that a user’s surplus with updated usage
values ¯X[1], . . . , ¯X[τ ] is always no less than its surplus
with planned usage values X[1], . . . , X[τ ]. From (30), we
ensure that µ95( ¯X[t]) ≤ µ95(X[t]). Therefore, the band-
width cost over a billing cycle with ¯X[t] is always no
higher than the bandwidth cost with X[t].

Next, we notice that the net utility over a billing cycle
with updated usage values, ¯X[t], is always no less than
the bandwidth cost with planned usage values, X[t], i.e.,
U (T min{ ¯X[t], ¯D[t]}) ≥ U (T min{X[t], ¯D[t]}),
∀t. (33)

To verify that (33) indeed holds, consider three cases:
Case 1: If ρ[t] = 0, ¯X[t] = ¯D[t]. Since the net utility func-
tion U (·) is nondecreasing and T > 0, (33) is satisﬁed.
Case 2: If ρ[t] = 1 and ¯D[t] ≤ µ95(X[t]), ¯X[t] = ¯D[t].
Same as case 1, in this case, (33) is satisﬁed.
Case 3: If ρ[t] = 1 and ¯D[t] > µ95(X[t]), ¯X[t] = µ95(X[t])
and X[t] ≤ µ95(X[t]). In this case, (33) is also satisﬁed.
Accordingly, as the surplus of a user over a cycle
equals its net utility minus its bandwidth cost over that
cycle, We can see that a user’s surplus with updated usage
values is always no less than its surplus with planned
usage values.

Identically, if the user can receive service from multi-
ple providers, we can also update its planned usage of
bandwidth at provider i, i.e., Xi[t], in real-time based on
the newly learned information of the exposed demand
¯D[t]. Let ¯Xi[t] denote the updated usage of bandwidth at

programming (29) into an equivalent mixed-integer con-
vex programming (as shown in Theorem 3) or MILP (as
shown in Theorem 4), where the mixed-integer convex
programming and the MILP can be solved via CBB and
MILP solvers, respectively.

5.2 Updating Usage of Bandwidth During a Cycle
Next, we show that the user can further improve its
surplus during a billing cycle, by updating its planned
usage of bandwidth at each time slot based on the newly
exposed demand. We also show that the user’s ﬁnal surplus
after a billing cycle will be no less than the expected
surplus. Here, we assume that, at the beginning of each
time slot, the user’s demand for bandwidth is exposed to
the user. We denote the exposed demand value at time slot
t by ¯D[t].

Generally, the demand D[t] may not be the same as
the exposed value ¯D[t]. Therefore, a user can update its
planned usage of bandwidth in real-time based on the
newly learned exposed demand information, i.e., ¯D[t], to
further improve its surplus while keeping its bandwidth
cost unchanged. For example, if X[t] < ¯D[t] and X[t] <
µ95(X[t]), the user can increase its usage from X[t] to
min{ ¯D[t], µ95(X[t])}. In this way, the user’s net utility
can be enhanced while remaining its bandwidth cost
unchanged.

In practice, the expected 95th percentile usage µ95(X[t]) is
treated as a rate limiter. According to Theorem 1, when

a ∈ (0, 1] measures the concavity of the user’s utility.
Namely, as a increases, the user’s utility becomes more
concave. Speciﬁcally, we assume that a = 0.1, A = 0.08
and the impact of the utility factor A on the surplus of
user will be discussed in Section 6.4.

We use a very simple workload forecasting method.
Let D1[t] and D2[t] denote the workload at time slot
t in the last two billing cycles, respectively. Suppose
that π1,t = π2,t = 0.5, ∀t = 1, . . . , τ. Speciﬁcally,
for deterministic surplus maximization, we assume that
D[t] = π1,tD1[t] + π2,tD2[t], for any t = 1, . . . , τ.

6.2 Computation Complexity of Proposed Solution
Methods
Recall from Section 4.2 that there are multiple options
to solve the stochastic problem (26). Speciﬁcally, the
proposed CBB method leads to the exact optimal so-
lution. The efﬁciency of the MILP method, however,
depends on the number of tangent lines N. Suppose
we choose ∆[t] = T Dk[t]/N. Fig. 4 shows the optimality
in percentage in applying the MILP method versus the
number of tangent lines N for different datasets. We can
see that the results are accurate when N ≥ 3. Therefore,
for the rest of this paper, we assume that N = 3.

Next, we evaluate the computation time for each
solution method. We use a personal computer with Intel
Xeon CPU E5-2450 @2.50GHZ. The results are shown in
Fig. 5(a). We can see that the computation time of CBB
is much longer than MILP. Even for the MILP approach,
it may take several hours to ﬁnd the global optimal
solution of problem (27) as the size of the problem
increases.

if ρi[t] = 0 or ¯D[t] ≤ µ95(Xi[t]);

where ρi[t] is the auxiliary variable as used in Theorem
1. Then, we formulate the user’s surplus over a cycle via

Similarly, a user can also further improve its surplus
via updating its planned usage according to (34) if it can
receive service from multiple providers.

Note that, since the ﬁnal surplus a user can achieve in
our design is obtained from (32) and (35), we use these
values as the user’s surplus, in the rest of this paper, to
evaluate the performance of our design.

6 CASE STUDIES
In this section, with real-world data traces, we ﬁrst
study the computation time and performance of our
proposed solution methods for solving the stochastic
problem (26). Second, we evaluate our design with a
simple method to forecast the demand for bandwidth.
Third, we discuss the impact of price and utility factor
on the performance of our design. Forth, we show that,
with multiple providers, the user can further improve its
surplus with our design.

6.1 Setup
We use two data sets in our case studies: 1) Wikien:
the page view data of Wikipedia English from January
2014 to May 2015 [21], 2) Wikimw: the page view data
of Wikipedia English Mobile from January 2014 to May
2015 [21], Example traces of these data sets are shown
in Fig. 3. Each time slot takes one hour and the billing
cycle takes 28 days for Wikien and Wikimw data sets.

The utility functions are selected as follows:
if a ∈ (0, 1);
if a = 1,

A(1 − a)−1x1−a,
Alog(x),

U (x) =

an approximate solution for problem (27) by terminating
the optimization solver at certain guaranteed optimality
bounds. This can be done by setting up a stopping condi-
tion for the MILP method based on the ratio between the
upper-bound and the lower-bound solutions. The upper-
bound solution is the surplus that can be achieved if
we relax the remaining binary variables at the current
branching stage. The lower-bound solution is the surplus
at the best binary solution that has been obtained so
far at the current branching stage. Clearly, this ratio
indicates a guaranteed optimality in the solution of MILP
that has already been reached at the current branching
stage. In this paper, we obtain an approximate solution
by stopping the MILP method in CPLEX once the above
mentioned ratio reaches 5%, which guarantees at least
95% optimality. We refer to this approximate solution
approach as the Near method.

As we can see in Fig. 5(a), the Near method is signif-
icantly less complex in terms of required computation,
compared to the CBB and MILP methods. Speciﬁcally,
the computational time for the Near method grows
only linearly with respect to the number of time slots.
Interestingly, we can see in Fig. 5(b) that the actual
achieved optimality is around 99% or more, i.e., much
better than the guaranteed 95% worst case optimality
value. Therefore, for the rest of this paper, we use the
Near method at 95% guaranteed optimality.

6.3 Performance Evaluation
As a Baseline for performance comparison, we consider
the case where the bandwidth is allocated on-demand,
i.e., X[t] = ¯X[t] = ¯D[t], for any t = 1, . . . , τ. Note that,
this approach resembles how the bandwidth is currently
allocated in practice. Next, we also assume an Ideal case
where the usage of bandwidth is optimized based on
true knowledge of demand, i.e., ∀t, D[t] = ¯D[t]. While
the Baseline shows how well we can perform compared
to the existing practice, the Ideal case shows the best
performance that we can ever get, assuming that we can
perfectly predict the upcoming workload.

Next, we compare the Baseline and Ideal cases with
our proposed Deterministic and Stochastic methods. The
Deterministic method refers to the case where the band-
width usage is scheduled based on the optimal solution
of the deterministic surplus maximization problem in
(13). The Stochastic method refers to the case where
the bandwidth usage is scheduled based on the optimal
solution of the stochastic surplus maximization problem
in (27) using the Near method with 95% guaranteed
optimality. The method of forecasting the workload in
each case was already explained in Section 6.1.

The results on performance comparison are shown in
Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, where the results for all methods
are normalized with respect to the results of the Ideal
case. Here, the price of bandwidth is set to be $15 per
Mbps. We can make the following observations based on
these results:

• As

a very simple method to forecast the demand for
bandwidth, the Deterministic and Stochastic solu-
tions outperform the Baseline in both bandwidth
cost reduction and surplus improvement. Thus, our
method is robust to the error of prediction of user’s
demand. Meanwhile, Deterministic and Stochastic
have similar outcomes.

shown in Fig. 8, on average, our pro-
posed optimization-based approach to respond to
burstable billing can greatly reduce the user’s band-
width cost while improving its surplus when com-
paring against Baseline. For example,with data trace
of Wikien, both Deterministic and Stochastic surplus
maximization can reduce the user’s bandwidth cost
by 26% while increasing its total surplus by 23%,
respectively.

6.4 Impact of Price and Utility Factor
Intuitively, increasing the price for bandwidth would
increase the user’s cost. Accordingly, the surplus that the
user may gain decreases as we increase price parameter
δ. However, the rate of such decrease is not the same for
different methods. The results are shown in Fig. 9. We
can see that the rate of decrease in surplus is higher for
the Baseline compared to the Deterministic and Stochas-
tic methods. As a results, the surplus improvements with
our proposed optimization-based approaches are higher
when the price of bandwidth is high.

ple providers under different workloads: a) Wikien, b)
Wikimw.

Next, we analyze the impact of utility factor A. Clearly,
increasing A results in higher surplus for the same usage
of bandwidth. By analysing Fig. 10, we ﬁnd that the
distance between Baseline and Deterministic/Stochastic
is slightly larger when A is small. Namely, users with
smaller utility factors, who are more sensitive to price
than performance, are more likely to response to the
burstable billing to improve their surpluses. We can
also see that the Deterministic and Stochastic methods
outperform the Baseline at all choices of A.

6.5 Impact of Multiple Providers
Suppose the user can receive service from two providers,
who are referred to as providers 1 and 2. Both of them
offer bandwidth at $15 per Mbps.

To evaluate our proposed approach to response to
burstable billing with multiple providers, we simulate
six different cases:

• Ideal-MSP: It is deﬁned as the outcome of maximiz-
ing surplus, under the assumption that the demand
for bandwidth is known with multiple providers.

• Baseline-SSP: In this case, the user utilizes band-

width from provider 1 on-demand.

• Deterministic-SSP:

In this case,

the user utilizes
bandwidth from provider 1 and makes its decisions
based on our design with deterministic prediction
about its demand.

• Stochastic-SSP: In this case, the user utilizes band-
width from provider 1 and makes its decisions
based on our design with stochastic prediction
about its demand.

• Deterministic-MSP: In this case, the user utilizes
bandwidth from both provider 1 and 2 and makes
its decisions based on our design with deterministic
prediction about its demand.

• Stochastic-MSP: In this case, the user utilizes band-
width from both provider 1 and 2 and makes its
decisions based on our design with stochastic pre-
diction about its demand.

Figures 11 and 12 show the normalized band-
width cost and surplus, obtained in six different
cases, where the base for normalization is the sur-
plus under
the Ideal-MSP case. We can see that
Deterministic-MSP and Stochastic-MSP methods always
outperform Baseline-SSP in both bandwidth cost reduc-
tion and surplus improvement. Finally, we also ﬁnd that
Deterministic-MSP and Stochastic-MSP are always better
than Deterministic-SSP and Stochastic-SSP. We may infer
that the availability of multiple providers further reduce
the user’s bandwidth cost and improves its surplus
under optimal response mechanism to burstable billing.

select the usage of bandwidth for a user, such as a user of

considers workload demand uncertainty, and is general
in the sense that it does not make any assumption
about the statistical characteristics of workload. Numer-
ical results based on empirical case studies conﬁrm that
even with a simply workload forecasting method, the
user can obtain signiﬁcantly higher surplus under the
proposed optimal method for responding to burstable
billing, compared to the current practice of allocating
bandwidth on-demand. We also extended our design to
another emerging practical scenario where a user can
receive service from multiple providers. Accordingly,
besides bandwidth allocation, our problem formulation
also addresses workload distribution.

This paper can be extended in several directions. First,
one can adopt a more advanced workload forecasting
method to better model probability distribution func-
tions for the demand for bandwidth. In fact, with enough
accurate prediction, the performance of the proposed
methods are guaranteed to improve. Second, one can try
to further reduce a user’s 95th percentile usage via trafﬁc
shaping [15], trafﬁc aggregation [16], trafﬁc shifting in
time and space [10], simultaneously. Finally, one can
revisit the problem from the provider’s viewpoint based
on the knowledge of how a user optimally responds to
burstable billing and adjusts the billing parameters to
achieve better results for the provider.
