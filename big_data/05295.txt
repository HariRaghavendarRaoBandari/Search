A SHARP INSCRIBED RADIUS ESTIMATE FOR FULLY

NONLINEAR FLOWS

SIMON BRENDLE AND PEI-KEN HUNG

Abstract. We prove a sharp estimate for the inscribed radius under
certain fully nonlinear curvature ﬂows. This estimate is asymptotically
sharp on cylinders.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we prove a sharp bound for the inscribed radius under
certain nonlinear ﬂows. Given a hypersurface in Euclidean space and a
point p on that hypersurface, the inscribed radius at p is deﬁned to be the
radius of the largest ball that lies inside the hypersurface and touches the
hypersurface at p. It follows from deep results of Brian White [13],[14] that,
for an embedded mean convex solution of mean curvature ﬂow, the inscribed
radius is bounded from below by α
H , where α > 0 is a uniform constant that
depends only on the initial data. An alternative proof of that fact was given
by Sheng and Wang [12]. In that paper, Sheng and Wang also introduced
the notions of noncollapsing and inscribed balls. Later, Andrews [1] gave
another proof of the inscribed radius estimate, which relies on a two-point
maximum principle. This technique was pioneered in Huisken’s work on the
curve shortening ﬂow [10] (see also [8]); a survey can be found in [3]. An
interesting feature of the argument in [1] is that it can be extended to certain
fully nonlinear curvature ﬂows; this was done in [2].

In [4], the ﬁrst author obtained a sharp estimate for the inscribed radius
for embedded mean convex solutions of mean curvature ﬂow. More precisely,
given any δ > 0, it turns out that the inscribed radius is bounded from
(1+δ)H at each point where the curvature is suﬃciently large. An
below by
alternative proof was subsequently given by Haslhofer and Kleiner [9].

Our goal in this paper is to extend the estimate in [4] to fully nonlinear
ﬂows. Speciﬁcally, we are interested in the following ﬂow for κ-two-convex
hypersurfaces introduced in [6]:

F : M n × [0, T ) 7−→ X n+1

= −Gκν.

The following is the main theorem of this note:

Theorem 1.1. Let F : M n × [0, T ) → X n+1 be a one-parameter family
of closed, embedded, κ two-convex hypersurfaces which move with velocity
Gκ. Then for any δ > 0 there exists a constant C1, depending only on
δ, T, M0, X, such that

µ ≤(cid:18) (n − 1)(n + 2)

Note that µ = (n−1)2(n+2)

G on a cylinder, so the constant in Theorem 1.1
is sharp. Like the results in [6], our estimate extends with straightforward
modiﬁcations to a larger class of fully nonlinear ﬂows; see [6, Remark 1.3]

2. Overview of results from [6]

In [6] many important properties, including convexity estimates, cylindri-
cal estimate, and curvature derivative estimate are established. For reader’s
convenience, we list some theorems in [6] which we will use in the following
sections.

X = Rn+1, under this ﬂow we have basic evolution equations

It is shown in [6] that Gκ, H and |A| are comparable along the ﬂow.

Theorem 2.2. [6, Theorem 3.1] For any δ > 0 there exists a constant C
depending on δ, T and the initial hypersurface M0 such that

Corollary 2.3. [6, Corollary 3.7] For any δ > 0 there exists a constant K1

λ1 ≥ −δGκ − K1.

3. A sharp bound for the largest curvature eigenvalue

Proposition 3.1. Let F : M n × (−θ, 0] → Rn+1, be a one-parameter family
of embedded, weakly convex hypersurfaces which move with velocity G. Sup-
pose there is a constant β > 0 such that hij ≤ βGgij in M n × (−θ, 0] and
λn(x0, t0) = β at some point (x0, t0) ∈ M n × (−θ, 0], then β ≤ (n−1)(n+2)

.

4

Proof. Denote by uij the two-tensor βGgij − hij. The evolution equation of
uij is

∂
∂t

ui

j =

∂G
∂hkl

∇k∇lui

j +

∂G
∂hkl

hp

khplui

j −

∂2G

∂hkl∂hpq

∇ihkl∇jhpq,

and the last term on the right hand side is nonnegative since G is concave.
The strong maximum principle applied to uij implies that the smallest eigen-
value of uij is equal to 0 at each point. (A detailed proof is given in the
appendix.) Thus, βG − λn = 0 at each point.

Claim. λn is a spatial constant.

To prove the claim, let us ﬁx an arbitrary point (x0, t0) ∈ M × (θ, 0].
We want to show that ∇λn = 0 at this point. Denote by E the eigenspace
of hij with eigenvalue λn = βG. We break the discussion into two cases,
depending on the dimension of E.

4

SIMON BRENDLE AND PEI-KEN HUNG

Case 1: Suppose ﬁrst that dim E = 1.

In this case, we can choose a

normal coordinate at (x0, t0) such that at (x0, t0) we have

∇khnj∇lhnj ≥ 0.

So we know ∇nhkl = ρhkl for some constant ρ and ∇khnj = 0 when-
ever j 6= n. Together with the Codazzi equation we get ∇nhij = 0 and
∇jλn = ∇nhn

j = 0.

Case 2: Suppose next that dim E ≥ 2. Let v, ˜v be two orthonormal
vectors in E. Extend v to a unit vector ﬁeld in spacetime such that ∇v = 0
at (x0, t0) and ∂

jvj at (x0, t0). Then we have

∂t vi = Ghi

∇ihkl∇jhpqvivj ≥ 0,

Consequently, vk∇khij = ρhij and similarly ˜vk∇khij = ˜ρhij. From the
Coddazzi equation

ρλn = ˜vi˜vjvk∇khij = ˜vi˜vjvk∇ihkj = ˜ρ˜vjvkhkj = 0.

Therefore, ρ = 0 and vk∇khij = 0 for all v ∈ E. In particular, vivj∇khij = 0
by the Codazzi equations. Since this holds for every unit vector v ∈ E, the
claim follows.

We now continue with the proof of Proposition 3.1. Since λn is a spatial
constant and βG − λn = 0, it follows that G is also a spatial constant. From

∂

the diagonalization of hij is preserved under the ﬂow and λj satisﬁes an

sequently, for each j, we either have λj = 0 or λn = n. In view of two-
convexity, the only two possibilities are

Proposition 3.2. Let F : M n × [0, T ) → X n+1 be a one-parameter family
of embedded, κ 2-convex hypersurfaces in X n+1 moving with velocity Gκ.
Then for any δ > 0 there is a constant C0, depending only on δ, T, M0, X,
such that λn ≤ ( (n−1)(n+2)

+ δ)Gκ + C0.

Proof. Deﬁne

We claim that β ≤ (n−1)(n+2)
. To prove this, we use a blow-up argument.
Take (xk, tk) be a sequence of spacetime points such that Gκ(xk, tk) → ∞
and λn(xk, tk)/Gκ(xk, tk) → β. By Theorem 2.4 the second fundamental
form and its derivatives are uniformly bounded in a parabolic neighborhood
κ , θ2Gκ(xk, tk)−2). By doing a parabolic dilation with center
P(xk, tk, θG−1
(xk, tk) and scale Gκ(xk, tk), we obtain a smooth limit ﬂow which moves with
velocity G. Along the limit ﬂow βGgij − hij ≥ 0 and βG − λn = 0 at (0, 0).
. Having established that β ≤ (n−1)(n+2)
By Proposition 3.1, β ≤ (n−1)(n+2)
,
the assertion follows easily.

minM0 Gκ and the injective radius of X, we can arrange that µ ≥ 8inj(X)−1
on the set {fσ ≥ 0}. Finally, by if we choose K0 large enough, then Gκ ≥ G#
on the set {fσ ≥ 0}. In the following, C denotes some constant depending

A SHARP INSCRIBED RADIUS ESTIMATE FOR FULLY NONLINEAR FLOWS

Proposition 6.1. Let Ω be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. As-
sume uij is non-negative in Ω × [0, T ] and λ1(u) = 0 at a point (x0, T ), then
λ1(u) = 0 in Ω × [0, T ]

Proof. It suﬃces to prove λ1(u) = 0 at time t = 0. We argue by contradic-
tion. If λ1(u)(y, 0) > 0 for some y ∈ Ω, we can ﬁnd a non-negative smooth
function f0 satisfying

0 ≤ f0 ≤ λ1(u) in Ω

f0(y) ≥

λ1(u)(y, 0)

for scalar functions, f > 0 in Ω × (0, T ]. By the weak maximum principle
for tensors (cf.
[7, Theorem 9.1]), ˜u ≥ 0 in Ω × [0, T ]. Thus uij(x0, T ) ≥
f (x0, T )gij > 0 which contradicts the assumption.
