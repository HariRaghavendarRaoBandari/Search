Abstract

Parker’s formulation of isotopological plasma relaxation process toward minimum magnet-
ics energy states in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is extended to electron MHD (EMHD).
The lower bound on magnetic energy in EMHD is determined by both the magnetic ﬁeld and
the electron vorticity ﬁeld topologies, and is shown to be reduced further in EMHD by an
amount proportional to the sum of total electron-ﬂow kinetic energy and total electron-ﬂow
enstrophy. The EMHD Beltrami condition becomes equivalent to the potential vorticity
conservation equation in two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamics, and the torsion coeﬃcient
and turns out to be proportional to potential vorticity. The winding pattern of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines appears to evolve therefore in the same way as potential vorticity lines in 2D
hydrodynamics.

1. Introduction

In the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, ions dominate the dynamics while electrons
merely serve to shield out rapidly any charge imbalances. On the other hand, in electron
MHD (EMHD) with length scales l ≪ ρs, s = i, e, ρs being the gyro-radius, electrons dom-
inate the dynamics while the demagnetized ions merely serve to provide the neutralizing
static background (Kingsep et al. [1]. Gordeev et al. [2]). The EMHD model restricts itself
to length scales l ≪ ds, where ds ≡ c/ωps is the skin depth, and frequencies ω > ωci and
ωpi, ωc being the cyclotron frequency. The frozen-in condition of magnetic ﬁeld in EMHD
is destroyed by electron inertia. Observations of plasmas in the magnetosphere (Deng and
Matsumoto [3]) and laboratory (Ren et al. [4]) showed that magnetic reconnection process
is initiated in very thin current sheets (thickness ∼ 0 (de)).

Equations governing several plasma dynamics models are known to admit a signiﬁcant
class of exact solutions (Shivamoggi [5]) under the Beltrami condition - the local current
density is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld - the force-free state (Lundquist [6], Lust and
Schluter [7]). Physically, the Beltrami solutions reﬂect the magnetic topology (in particu-
lar, the magnetic ﬂux linkage) constraint on the ways in which plasmas can minimize total
energy and are known to correlate well with real plasma behavior (Priest and Forbes [8],
Schindler [9]). On the other hand, Parker [10]-[12] showed that, in certain plasma pro-
cesses, the Beltrami condition is indeed equivalent to the vorticity conservation equation in
two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamics (and the Lagrange multiplier α turned out to be pro-
portional to vorticity). An important issue associated with the role of current sheets in the
development of plasma equilibrium in the EMHD model is the relaxation of plasma as the
magnetic ﬁeld lines are wrapped around and intermixed by turbulent motions in the plasma.
(Current-sheet formation may indeed be viewed as a natural concomitant of magnetic relax-
ation to a minimum energy state (Parker [13])). In particular, it is important to determine
if the current sheets play the same role in the development of EMHD equilibrium as they do
in MHD (Parker [10]-[12]) and Hall MHD (Shivamoggi [14]), and how the winding pattern
of the magnetic ﬁeld lines evolves in EMHD. The purpose of this paper is to address this
issue.

2. Beltrami States in EMHD

bounds the volume V occupied by the plasma and moves with the electron ﬂuid or that V

be resolved via the gauge condition,

3. Plasma Relaxation in an Applied Uniform Magnetic Field: Parker Problem
in EMHD

Following Parker [10]-[12], consider a plasma in an applied magnetic ﬁeld and conﬁned
between two inﬁnite parallel planes z = 0 and L. The ﬁeld lines of an initially uniform
ˆiz are wrapped around and intermixed by random turbulent motion
magnetic ﬁeld B0 = B0
of their footpoints on these two planes. This interlaced magnetic ﬁeld then relaxes under
the control of topological aspects toward the lowest available energy state1 described by

1As a solar plasma application, magnetic ﬁeld lines at the edge of the photosphere execute a random walk due to turbulent
convection in the photosphere. These braided magnetic ﬁeld lines are believed to relax isotopologically toward minimum
magnetic energy states. The lower bound on magnetic energy is determined by the magnetic ﬁeld topology, because a non-
trivial magnetic topology may be seen to hinder the full dissipation of magnetic energy (Arnol’d and Khesin [15]). This lower
bound is reduced further in EMHD by amount proportional to the sum of the total electron-ﬂow kinetic energy and total
electron-ﬂow enstrophy (see Appendix).

where the Lagrange multiplier α may be interpreted as a torsion coeﬃcient.

Suppose this process exhibits slow variations in the z-direction, characterized by the slow

spatial scale

Let the magnetic ﬁeld involved in this process be given by

ξ ≡ εz, ε ≪ 1

ˆix + εB0by
and let the Lagrange multiplier α be given by

B = εB0bx

ˆiy + B0 (1 + εbz)ˆiz

Using (16)-(18), equation (14) may be rewritten as

α = 1/εa.

vex = σ (C1εbx + ωex) ≈ σ(cid:18)C1εbx +
vey = σ(cid:0)C1εby + ωey(cid:1) ≈ σ(cid:18)C1εby +

vez = σ [C1 (1 + εbz) + ωez ]

where σ and C1 are appropriate constants.

On the other hand, equation (15) may be rewritten as

The divergence - free condition on B gives

we then obtain from equation (19c),

ωez ≡ εσC1ω

w ≈ σ2ω

Using (28) and (29), equation (27) gives

Using (30), equation (25) leads to

ω ≈ −∇2(cid:0)ψ + σ2ω(cid:1) .

a = ω − σ2∇2ω ∼ q.

So, the torsion coeﬃcient a is proportional to the “potential vorticity” q.
On the other hand, taking the divergence of equation (15), we obtain

Using (18) and (31), equation (32) leads to

So, the Beltrami condition (15) in EMHD becomes equivalent to the “potential vorticity”
conservation equation2 in 2D hydrodynamics, and the torsion coeﬃcient. α turns out to
be proportional, as per (31), to “potential vorticity”. The winding pattern of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines in EMHD therefore evolves in the same way as “potential vorticity” lines in 2D
hydrodynamics.

4. Discussion

In this paper, we have extended Parker’s [10]-[12] formulation of isotopological plasma
relaxation process toward minimum magnetic energy states in MHD to EMHD. The lower
bound on magnetic energy in EMHD is determined by both the magnetic ﬁeld and the
electron-ﬂow vorticity ﬁeld topologies. This lower bound is reduced further in EMHD by
an amount proportional to the sum of total electron-ﬂow kinetic energy and total electron-
ﬂow enstrophy (see Appendix). The EMHD Beltrami condition becomes equivalent to the
“potential vorticity” conservation equation in 2D hydrodynamics, and the torsion coeﬃcient.
α turns out to be proportional to “potential vorticity. The winding pattern of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines therefore evolves in EMHD in the same way as “potential vorticity” lines in 2D
hydrodynamics. The analogy between a smooth, continuous magnetic ﬁeld in EMHD and
2D hydrodynamics as that in ordinary MHD (Parker [12]) implies that the current sheets
seem to have the same role in the development of EMHD equilibria as they do in the MHD
(and Hall MHD [15]) cases.

Appendix

The conservation of generalized magnetic ﬁeld topology characterized by He (see (11))
while minimizing H (see (4)) prevents the later from decaying to zero in an EMHD relaxation
process. This may be seen by following along the lines of Arnol’d [18].

The total generalized electron-ﬂow magnetic velocity invariant He may be rewritten as,

2By contrast, in Hall MHD (Shivamoggi [14]), the “potential vorticity” q therefore becomes identical (about from a propor-
tionality constant) to the potential vorticity for ﬂuids in the quasi-geostrophic approximation. (Quasi-geostrophic dynamics
refers to the nonlinear dynamics governed by the ﬁrst-order departure from the linear geostrophic balance between the Coriolis
force and pressure gradient transverse to the rotation axis of a rapidly rotating ﬂuid.) This may be seen by noting that, using
(23c) and (33) in [14], (34) may be rewritten as

The second term on the right in (I) represents an additional transport mechanism for the magnetic ﬁeld via the Hall current in
Hall MHD (Sonnerup [16]).

(I) becomes

For comparison, one may note one version of potential vorticity for ﬂuids in quasic-geostrophic approximation (Charney [17]),

ψ being the stream function of the ﬂow, and l is the Rossby deformation radius. The second term on the right in (IV) represents
the vortex stretching eﬀect due to the deformed free surface in ﬂuid subject to gravity. The similarity between (III) and (IV)
becomes all the more striking, especially on noting that the out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld bz plays the role of the stream function
for in-plane ion ﬂows in Hall MHD.

kinetic energy and total electron-ﬂow enstrophy.

gives rise to a lower-limit on the energy.
