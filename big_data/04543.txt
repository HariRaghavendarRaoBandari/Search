On the derivation of several second order

partial diﬀerential equations from a generalization

of the Einstein equation

Makoto NAKAMURA ∗

Abstract

A generalization of the Einstein equation is considered for complex line ele-
ments. Several second order semilinear partial diﬀerential equations are derived
from it as semilinear ﬁeld equations in uniform and isotropic spaces. The non-
relativistic limits of the ﬁeld equations are also considered. The roles of spatial
variance are studied based on energy estimates, and several dissipative or an-
tidissipative properties are remarked.

Introduction

In this paper, we report some results on the relation between the Einstein equa-
tion and several second order partial diﬀerential equations. We consider a gen-
eralization of the Einstein equation for non-Hermitian complex line elements of
the form gαβ(z)dzαdzβ, where {gαβ }0≤α,β≤n are complex-valued functions and z =
(z0, · · · , zn) ∈ C1+n. Under the cosmological principle, we give the solution of the
generalized Einstein equation as

gαβdzαdzβ = −c2(dz0)2 + a(z0)2q2(cid:18)1 +

where c > 0 is the speed of light, q(6= 0), k ∈ C are constants, and a is a complex-
valued function which denotes the scale-function of the space. This is known as the

Robertson-Walker metric when n = 3, z = (t, x1, x2, x3) ∈ R4, q = 1 and k2 = 0, ±1,
where k2 denotes the curvature of the space. There is a large body of literature on
the generalization of the Einstein equation for Hermitian line elements, complex line
elements and general dimensions (see e.g., [2, 3, 7, 8]).

As the equation of motion of massive scalar ﬁeld described by a complex-valued
function φ = φ(z0, · · · , zn) with mass m and potential λ|φ|p−1φ2/(p + 1) with λ ∈ C
and 1 ≤ p < ∞, we derive the second order diﬀerential equation

w is a weight function deﬁned by w(z0) := b0(a(0)/a(z0))n/2 for a constant b0 ∈ C.
By a transformation (see (2.1), below) from the complex coordinates z to the real
coordinates (t, x1, · · · , xn) ∈ R1+n, the equations (1.1) and (1.2) give typical second
order partial diﬀerential equations. For example, let us consider the simplest case
that the scale-function is a constant a = 1. From (1.1) and (1.2), we obtain the
Klein-Gordon equation

(1.6)

(see Section 5, below), where we have put ∆x := Pn

j=1 ∂2/(∂xj)2. The terms
λ|φ|p−1φ and λ|u|p−1u are fundamental semilinear terms in nonlinear theory to con-
sider more complicated nonlinear terms. For the last parabolic equation, we note
that the dimension of /m in the SI units is M2S−1 (M: meter, S: second), which
is equivalent to the dimension of the thermal diﬀusivity K1 of the heat equation

2

∂tu − K1∆xu = 0, and also to the dimension of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient K2 of the
diﬀusion equation ∂tu − K2∆xu = 0.

It is well-known that the Schr¨odinger equation (1.4) is derived from the Klein-
Gordon equation (1.3) by the transform φ = ue∓imc2t/ and the nonrelativistic limit
c → ∞. One of the aims of this paper is to show that the generalization of the Ein-
stein equation gives a uniﬁed way to derive the above important partial diﬀerential
equations. It is remarkable that we have the uniﬁed derivation for the hyperbolic
equation and the parabolic equation since these two equations have diﬀerent physi-
cal backgrounds and derivations. The solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation (1.3)
and the Schr¨odinger equation (1.4) have the properties of waves, while the solutions
of the equation (1.6) as the diﬀusion equation have the properties of particles. In
complex coordinates, these equations are uniﬁed in the forms of (1.1) and (1.2). The
properties of the equations are dependent on the local coordinates which we choose
(see the wave-particle duality in [4] and [6]). In this sense, it is natural to consider
the spacetime in complex coordinates, and we are able to regard (1.1) and (1.2) as
the equations which describe the properties of energy.

In Section 2, we consider a generalization of the Einstein equation.
In Section 3, we consider the spatial variance described by the scale-function a,
which satisﬁes the Einstein equation with the cosmological constant in uniform and
isotropic spaces. The study of roles of the cosmological constant and the spatial
variance is important to describe the history of the universe, especially, the inﬂation
and the accelerating expansion of the universe (see, e.g., [9], [10], [13], [14], [15],
[16]). The scale-function (3.10), below, follows from the equation of state when we
regard the cosmological constant as the dark energy (see (3.8), below). In this pa-
per, we study the cosmological constant from the point of view of partial diﬀerential
equations. Especially, we remark that some dissipative and antidissipative prop-
erties appear by the spatial variance. These properties have been studied for the
Klein-Gordon equation and the Schr¨odinger equation in de Sitter spacetime (see [11]
and [12] and the references therein). We consider the properties for more general
equations (1.1) and (1.2) in this paper.

In Sections 4 and 5, we derive the above equations (1.1), (1.2), (1.3), (1.4), (1.5)

and (1.6).

In Section 6, we consider the energy estimates of the equations (1.1) and (1.2).
We show that the spatial variance described by the scale-function a gives dissipative
and antidissipative properties for the estimates.

In Section 7, we give some remarks on Vilenkin’s model of the early universe
in our setting of complex line elements (see [17] for Vilenkin’s model). Vilenkin’s
model shows that the purely imaginary time axis it for t ∈ R plays an important

3

role to describe the birth of the universe from nothing through the tunnel eﬀect.
This fact is one of motivations to regard the axes of the spacetime as the lines in
the complex plane (see (2.1), below).

In Section 8, we also consider the geodesic curves deﬁned by the complex line
elements, and we show that the conservation law of the Hamiltonian is dependent
on the scale-function in local coordinates, although it is independent of the scale-
function in proper time.

One of motivations to consider the complex line element gαβdzαdzβ is to gener-
alize the following elementary observation. The Riemann metric (cdx0)2 + (dx1)2 +
· · · + (dxn)2 and the Lorentz metric −(cdx0)2 + (dx1)2 + · · · + (dxn)2 for x =
(x0, x1, · · · , xn) ∈ R1+n are uniﬁed in a single form (cdz0)2 + (dz1)2 + · · · + (dzn)2
for z ∈ C1+n since (z0, z1, · · · , zn) = (x0, x1, · · · , xn) gives the former metric and
(z0, z1, · · · , zn) = (ix0, x1, · · · , xn) gives the latter metric. Let us consider two coor-

dinates z = (z0, z1, · · · , zn) ∈ C1+n and z∗ = (z0

∗eiω in the complex plane C, where
t, t∗, x1, x1

∗ ∈ R. Then we have the transform

∗ = it∗ and z1

So that, the complex line element naturally uniﬁes the rotational transform and the
Lorentz transform. Based on this observation, we further study the properties of the
complex line elements through the Einstein equation. We report some fundamental
results (derivations and energy estimates) on the equations (1.1) and (1.2) in this
paper. More detailed results on the equations will appear in the future.

2 A generalization of the Einstein equation

In this section, we generalize the Einstein equation for the case of three spatial
dimensions and real line elements (see e.g., [1] and [5]) into the case of general
dimensions and complex line elements. Although we are based on the classical
argument for the former case, we show the details for the completeness of the paper.
In the following, Greek letters α, β, γ, · · · run from 0 to n, Latin letters j, k, ℓ, · · · run
from 1 to n. We use the Einstein rule for the sum of indices of tensors, for example,
i. For any C 1-curve C in the complex plane
T α
C connecting a point A ∈ C to a point B ∈ C parametrized by z = z(x) ∈ C for
x ∈ R with dz/dx 6= 0, we note that the integration by parts

holds for any C 1-functions f and g. For real variables x = (x0, · · · , xn) ∈ R1+n and
arbitrarily ﬁxed real numbers (ω0, · · · , ωn) ∈ (−π/2, π/2]1+n, we consider complex
variables z = (z0, · · · , zn) ∈ C1+n parametrized by

zα = eiωα

xα.

(2.1)

We put ∂α := ∂/∂zα = e−iωα
∂/∂xα. We deﬁne a (1 + n)-dimensional manifold
M := {z ∈ C1+n | zα = eiωα
xα, xα ∈ R, 0 ≤ α ≤ n}. We consider a bilinear
symmetric complex-valued functional h·, ·i on the vector space spanned by the vectors
{∂α}0≤α≤n. We put gαβ(z) := h∂α, ∂βi. We denote by (gαβ (z)) the matrix whose
components are given by {gαβ (z)}0≤α,β≤n. Put g(z) := det(gαβ (z)). Let (gαβ(z))
be the inverse matrix of (gαβ(z)). We consider a line element

− (cdτ )2 = (dℓ)2 := gαβ(z)dzαdzβ,

(2.2)

where τ denotes the proper time and we take the square root of (cdτ )2 as −π <
arg (cdτ ) ≤ π. We deﬁne dz by

dz = dz0 ∧ · · · ∧ dzn :=Xσ

sgn(σ) dzσ(0) · · · dzσ(n),

where σ denotes the permutation of {0, · · · , n}. For the change of variables x to
y = (y0, · · · , yn) ∈ R1+n by y = y(x), we consider the complex variables w =
(w0, · · · , wn) by wα = eiωα
yα. Then we have det(∂zα/∂wβ) ∈ R, (−g(z))1/2 =
|det(∂wα/∂zβ )|(−g(w))1/2, and (−g(w))1/2dw = sgn det(∂wα/∂zβ ) (−g(z))1/2dz by
direct calculations, where g(w) denotes the determinant of (gαβ(w)) with gαβ(w) :=
h∂/∂wα, ∂/∂wβ i, and we take the square root of −g as −π < arg(−g) ≤ π. We have

the case n ≥ 3 and complex line elements, we are able to generalize the constant κ
to

κ :=

2(n − 1)πn/2G

(2.8)

where Γ denotes the gamma function. Let us show the derivation of (2.8). We denote
the volume of the unit ball in Rn by Ωn := 2πn/2/nΓ(n/2). We put ˆz := (z1, · · · , zn),

the function E(ˆz) satisﬁes

∆ˆzE(ˆz) = δ(ˆz),

(2.9)

j=1 ∂2/(∂zj )2 and δ denotes the Dirac δ-function. We assume that
(gαβ) is suﬃciently close to the Minkowski matrix (ηαβ) := diag(−c2, 1, · · · , 1).
Namely, we put hαβ := gαβ − ηαβ, and we assume that |hαβ| is suﬃciently small. For

where ∆ˆz :=Pn
a potential φ = φ(ˆz) and the Lagrangian L(ˆz, dˆz/dτ ) :=Pn

nXj=1

where h and f are complex-valued functions. This line element is uniform in
the sense that for any two points P and Q in Cn, the ratio of the coeﬃcients
eh(z0)ef (r(P ))/eh(z0)ef (r(Q)) is independent of z0.

Remark 3.1. The line element (3.11) is known as the Robertson-Walker metric for
the case that a(> 0) is real-valued, z ∈ R1+n, n = 3, q = 1 and k2 = 0, ±1. Here,
k2 denotes the curvature of the space. In this case, a in (3.10) blows up in ﬁnite
time when ∂0a(0) > 0 and σ < −1, which is called Big-Rip in cosmology. The case
σ = −1 shows the exponential expansion of a when ∂0a(0) > 0. The case σ > −1
shows the polynomial expansion of a when ∂0a(0) > 0. These models are studied for
the accelerating expansion of the universe. The line element (3.11) with (3.10) is a
natural extension of these models for general dimensions and complex line elements.

5 A uniﬁed derivation of several PDEs

Let us consider the equations (4.2) and (4.3) under the transform (2.1) with ω1 =
· · · = ωn. We put t = x0 and

φ∗(t, x1, · · · , xn) := φ(z0, · · · , zn),
u∗(t, x1, · · · , xn) := u(z0, · · · , zn),
a∗(t) := a(z0), w∗(t) := w(z0).

The equation (5.2) and its nonrelativistic limit (5.3) give a uniﬁed derivation of
the elliptic equation, the Klein-Gordon equation, the Schr¨odinger equation, and the
parabolic equation as follows. For simplicity, we consider the simplest case a = 1
which follows from a(0) = 1 and ∂0a(0) = 0 in (3.10). So that, we have θ = 0 and
a∗ = 1. We put b0 = 1, which yields w∗ = 1. When ω0 = · · · = ωn = 0, (5.2) and
(5.3) are rewritten as the Klein-Gordon equation

of dissipation, while the spatial contraction H < 0 yields the eﬀect of antidissipation
(see e.g., [11] for the Klein-Gordon equation in de Sitter spacetime). We also note
that the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation

∂tu∗ − γ∆u∗ − λ1u∗ + λ2|u∗|2u∗ = 0,

(5.9)

where γ ∈ C with Re γ > 0, λ1 ≥ 0, λ2 ∈ C with Re λ2 > 0, is considered as the sum

6 Energy estimates

We have derived the equations (4.2) and (4.3). The properties of the equations
depend on the coordinate (t, x) deﬁned by t := x0 and (2.1). For example, we
will see that the equations have dissipative or antidissipative properties on energy
estimates dependently on ω0, · · · , ωn. We assume that there exist two functions V0
and V ′

0 on C which satisfy

∂tV0(ψ) = Re(cid:0)∂tψ V ′

0(ψ)(cid:1)

(6.1)

for any function ψ = ψ(t, x). We put ω1 = · · · = ωn, t = x0 and (5.1). We assume
that θ := arg (a∗(t)) is a constant. We put V ′ := −e−2i(θ+ω1)V ′

en+1 < 0, respectively. The eﬀects by the spatial variance also appear in (6.8) and
(6.9) dependently on the structure of the potential V0. Let us consider the case
θ = ω0 = 0 and ω1 = π/4 in Lemma 6.2. Then the equation (6.5) with the pos-
itive sign is the parabolic equation. Since Im(e2i(θ+ω1)/e2iω0
) = 1, the dissipative
properties always appear in (6.8) and (6.9) when V0 = 0. The eﬀects by the spatial
variance also appear in the properties dependently on the structure of the potential
V0. Consequently, the spatial variance is one of key factors which determine the
dissipative and antidissipative properties of the equations.

7 Remarks on Vilenkin’s model

Let us consider the model of the birth of the universe by Vilenkin and generalize
it to the case of general dimensions and complex line elements. We have derived
the line element (3.11), which is from (3.1) with (3.2), (3.3) and (3.10). We put

ef (z) := h(z0) + f (r). By a direct calculation, we have g = −c2en ef , ∂α(−g)1/2 =

for some constant C ∈ C. Let us consider the case ±k/q = 1, C = 0, ℓ > 0, κ ∈ R,
Λ(6= 0) ∈ R and z0 = t ∈ R. Then we have a(t) = ℓ cosh(ct/ℓ), and a, L, p, H are
real-valued. We need a ≥ ℓ for the equation H = 0 since V > 0 and H > 0 if a < ℓ.
This means that the universe grows up as the de Sitter spacetime a(t) = ℓ cosh(ct/ℓ)
for t ≥ 0 in real time z0 = t. To consider the excluded case a < ℓ, let us use the
imaginary time z0 = it for t < 0. Then we have a(t) = ℓ cos(ct/ℓ) for t < 0. We
need −πℓ/2c < t for a(t) > 0. Since V (a) > 0 for −πℓ/2c < t < 0, we have the
model that the universe passes through the mountain of the potential V (a) > 0 by
the tunnel eﬀect in imaginary time z0 = it for −πℓ/2c < t < 0, then it grows up
as the de Sitter spacetime in real time z0 = t for t ≥ 0. On the other hand, the
solution a(z0) = a(0)e±cz0/ℓ for k = 0 and real time z0 = t does not need the tunnel
eﬀect.

8 Remarks on the geodesic curves

Since the line element (2.2) is considered in complex coordinates, let us consider the
geodesic curves derived form it. We consider the generalized line element of (3.1)
given by

−c2(dτ )2 = −c2(dz0)2 + gjkdzjdzk

for arbitrary complex-valued functions {gjk}1≤j,k≤n which satisfy the symmetry con-
ditions gjk = gkj for 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n. We put the velocity vj := dzj/dz0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
Let (gjk) be the inverse matrix of (gjk). The change of upper and lower indices is
done by gjk and gjk. We put J := 1 − vjvj/c2, and the potential U = U (z0, · · · , zn).
We denote the mass by m. We deﬁne the Lagrangian L, the momenta {pj}n
j=1, and
the Hamiltonian H by

L := −mc2J 1/2 − U, pj :=

∂L
∂vj , H := vjpj − L.

(8.1)

We put K := m2c2 + pjpj. By direct calculations, we have dτ = J 1/2dz0, ∂J/∂vj =
−2vj/c2, ∂J/∂gjk = −vjvk/c2, pj = mvjJ −1/2, ∂L/∂zα = −∂U/∂zα, ∂L/∂gjk =
J 1/2pjpk/2m. So that, the Euler-Lagrange equation for L is given by

We have

K 1/2 = mcJ −1/2, H = cK 1/2 + U

(8.2)

by pjpj = m2c2(J −1 − 1). Since we have ∂K/∂pj = 2pj and ∂K/∂gjk = pjpk, we
have ∂H/∂pj = vj, ∂H/∂gjk = cpjpk/2K 1/2 and ∂H/∂zα = ∂U/∂zα. Therefore, we

HR(w)dw = H(0).

(8.3)

Now, we consider the transformation (2.1) with ω1 = · · · = ωn. We consider the
case (gjk) := a(z0)2diag(1, · · · , 1), namely, the case q = 1 and k = 0 in (3.11). Then
we have

by pj = mei(ω1−ω0)J −1/2dxj/dx0, (8.2) and ∂gℓm/∂zj = 0. Especially, let us consider
the case that ω0 = 0, ω1 = 0, ±π/2, π, m ≥ 0. Let U and a(> 0) be real-valued
functions. Let us consider the small velocity such that J > 0. Then J, K, H, HR are
real-valued functions. Moreover, if −∂U/∂x0 ≥ 0 and

da

dx0( ≥ 0 for ω1 = 0, π,

2 ,

then HR ≥ 0. So that, the spatial variance da/dx0 6= 0 has dissipative and antidis-
sipative eﬀects on the conservation (8.3), while the spatial invariance da/dx0 = 0
yields the strict conservation H(x0) = H(0) for x0 ∈ R when ∂U/∂x0 = 0. Namely,
the conservation of the Hamiltonian depends on the spatial variance.

Let us consider the above argument for the relativistic velocity vα := dzα/dτ
for 0 ≤ α ≤ n for the general line element (2.2). We put J := −vαgαβvβ, and the
potential U = U (z0, · · · , zn). We denote the mass by m. We deﬁne the Lagrangian
L, the momenta {pα}n

α=0, and the Hamiltonian H by

L := −mcJ 1/2 − U, pα :=

∂L
∂vα , H := vαpα − L.

(8.5)

Since ∂J/∂vγ = −2vγ and ∂J/∂gαβ = −vαvβ, we have vα = J 1/2pα/mc and
∂L/∂gαβ = mcvαvβ/2J 1/2. The equation (8.5) is rewritten as

Since we have H = U by vγvγ = −J and the deﬁnitions of H and L, the Hamiltonian
H is a constant function independent of the proper time τ . Namely, we have

H(τ ) = H(0).

(8.7)

Comparing the conservation laws (8.3) and (8.7), we conclude that the Hamil-
tonian is strictly conserved with respect to the proper time τ independently of the
spatial variance, while the Hamiltonian is dependent on the spatial variance with
respect to the local time z0.
