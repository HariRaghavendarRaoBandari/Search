Abstract. Stimulated emission by black holes is discussed in light of the analogue
gravity program. We ﬁrst consider initial quantum states containing a deﬁnite number
of particles, and then we take into account the case where the initial state is a coherent
state. The latter case is particularly signiﬁcant in the case where Hawking radiation is
studied in dielectric black holes, and the emission is stimulated by a laser probe. We
are particularly interested in the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, for which stimulated
radiation is calculated too.

1. Introduction

Stimulated emission by black holes has is a longstanding topic in quantum ﬁeld theory
on a black hole background, which was taken into account since the very early studies in
black hole evaporation [1, 2]. See also [3, 4]. Since the former analysis, it appeared that
stimulated radiation is far from being of practical interest in the case of astrophysical
black holes. Still, a relevant role for stimulated radiation is deserved in some attempts
to solve the unitarity problem, because of the fact that stimulated radiation carries out
information [5, 6]. We don’t delve into the latter aspect. A diﬀerent consideration for
the same topic has to be deserved in the case of analogue gravity, because conditions
where stimulated emission can play a very relevant role can be actually realized in labs.
In particular, we are interested in dielectric black holes which are obtained as moving
dielectric perturbations associated with strong laser pulses in nonlinear dielectric media
via Kerr eﬀect. Indeed, a further laser probe, of weak intensity (so not participating
the Kerr eﬀect) can be shot onto the dielectric perturbation, in such a way that a
intense stimulated emission of pairs can occur. The conditions under which such stim-
ulated emission is possible have been studied, both numerically and experimentally, by
D.Faccio group in [7, 8, 9]. We limit ourselves to recall that the original idea of the
Kerr eﬀect as a tool for studying Hawking radiation in dielectric black holes can be
traced back to Ref. [10], and a series of papers on the subject appeared in the literature
[11, 12, 13, 14, 7, 15, 16, 17, 8, 18, 9, 19, 20].

Herein, we take into account some theoretical aspects of this stimulation
phenomenon. We ﬁrst follow strictly the presentation given in [3], which adopts the
strategy of Bogoliubov transformations between IN and OUT states in a collapse
situation. This strategy is well-known in black hole emission process since the seminal
calculation by S.W.Hawking. As usual, a Fock space state with a deﬁnite number
of particles is taken into account. We also provide a very simple deduction of the
stimulated contribution to pair creation by means of thermoﬁeld dynamics formalism,
which is particularly useful once more.
As a further matter of analysis, we take into consideration the case of a coherent state
as initial state. This choice is, to some extent, on the opposite side with respect to the
standard choice of a quantum state belonging to the Fock space, as it represents the
best approximation to a classical state, to be compared with the eminently quantum
nature of a Fock state. The coherent state stimulation appears of limited interest in
the astrophysical black hole state, but is actually a very interesting topic in the case
of dielectric black holes.
Indeed, stimulated Hawking radiation can be obtained as
described above, by means of a weak laser probe, whose nature of coherent light is well-
known. This same strategy can be used also in the case of dielectric dispersive black
holes, and we shall use it also for the standard ternary process which is at the root of
Hawking radiation in the dielectric case.
We don’t consider herein a full calculation for the full electromagnetic case, which

Stimulated emission and Hawking radiation in black hole analogues

3

appears to be very involved, and limit our considerations to some general properties we
expect to be implemented also in the full calculation, which is deferred to future works.
The conclusions that we can infer for the standard ternary process IN → P + N ,
where IN stays for the input particle state, and P and N stay for the particle and
antiparticle ﬁnal states, are the expected ones: the created pairs are such that one
emitted photon is found in the P mode peak and the companion photon (antiparticle) is
found in the N mode peak. The spontaneous contribution is unpolarized, as it should be
due to thermality of the spontaneous radiation, whereas the stimulated one is suitably
polarized, in such a way that a created photon is polarized in the same way as the
stimulating particle or antiparticle state. As a consequence, given an IN state populated
by particle states with a given polarization, one obtains a P mode peak and a N mode
peak, all with the same polarization.

2. Stimulated emission and black holes
We start by summarizing some calculations appearing in [3]. Let {fi} be a set of positive
norm solutions for the Klein-Gordon equation in the initial state labeled by IN (no black
hole), and let us deﬁne {pi} as positive norm solutions available at inﬁnity when a static
black hole is present (label OU T ). As known, to the latter set one has to join a further
set of states {qi} which are not available to the distant observer (horizon states, label
H) in order to get a basis for the solutions in presence of a static black hole. As both
{fi} and {pi} ∪ {qi} represent a basis of solutions, one can e.g. write

pi =

qi =

It is worth noting that the above formulas hold true also in a more generic case where
one passes from an IN state to a OUT one. Indeed, the horizon states do not aﬀect the
results for what concerns the number of particles measured at inﬁnity.
According to the calculations in [2], which amount substantially to the ones obtained
in [3] by means of a careful wave packet analysis in a collapse situation, one ﬁnds in the
black hole case

It is interesting to note that, when

the stimulated eﬀect dominates over the spontaneous one, and in absence of initial
antiparticles, one obtains

(19)

It is worth noting that stimulated emission can be calculated also by assuming as thermal
state the Hartle-Hawking one, and by exploiting the relations between Hartle-Hawking
state and Thermoﬁeld Dynamics as in [25]. The calculation is straightforward, and
proceeds as follows. We recall that in the thermoﬁeld dynamics formalism one deﬁnes a
thermal state |0(β) > characterized by an inverse temperature β. This state requires a
doubling of degrees of freedom with respect to the standard quantum ﬁeld theory at zero
temperature, and the (unobservable) copy of the ﬁctitious Hilbert space is characterized
by operators with a tilde symbol. The thermal state |0(β) > is annihilated by suitable
operators al(β), ˜al(β), bl(β), ˜bl(β) (and conjugated ones) which are labeled by a complete
set of quantum numbers l and is related to “standard” annihilation-creation operators
al, ˜al, bl, ˜al (and conjugated ones) via a formally unitary transformation:

al = cosh(φωl)al(β) + sinh(φωl)˜a
†
l = sinh(φωl)al(β) + cosh(φωl)˜a
˜a

†
l (β),
†
l (β),

and analogous for b-operators, with
tanh(φωl) = e−βωl/2.

It holds

States |nωj >L,|nωj >R are Boulware states with nωj particles. Killing observers in
the R-region cannot measure L-states, so a trace over the latter ones is required. As a
consequence, for the expectation value of an operator (observable) AR, constructed by
means of Boulware vacuum creation and annihilation operators, one obtains

Thermoﬁeld dynamics formalism allows us to set out the following identiﬁcations:

αk = cosh(φωk),
βk = sinh(φωk),

(29)

(30)

i.e. the Bogoliubov transformation is diagonal and, moreover, real valued. According to
the deﬁnition in [26], we can introduce thermal number states as follows (for simplicity,
we refer to a single mode of the ﬁeld):

|n(β) >=

1√

(a†(β))n|0(β) >,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(31)

Stimulated emission can be obtained by calculating the mean value of Nk, ¯Nk on thermal
number states: we deﬁne

< Ak >n,¯n,β:=< nk(β), ¯nk(β)|Ak|nk(β), ¯nk(β) >,

then we obtain

< Nk >n,¯n,β = sinh2(φωk) + cosh2(φωk)nk(β) + sinh2(φωk)¯nk(β),
< ¯Nk >n,¯n,β = sinh2(φωk) + sinh2(φωk)nk(β) + cosh2(φωk)¯nk(β),

which correspond to the above mentioned results for stimulated emission by black holes.
Note that

(36)

Stimulated emission appears as the mean value of the number operator over an ‘initial’
state which is a thermoﬁeld state with non-zero thermal particles/antiparticles. In a
black hole context, we have non-zero Hartle-Hawking particles stimulating the emission
process. A more direct physical intuition can be provided by the Unruh eﬀect situation:
non-zero particles as excitations of the Minkowski vacuum stimulate the thermal
emission for the Rindler observer.

3. Stimulated emission and initial coherent states

In the previous section, we discussed what happens if the initial state is characterized by
a deﬁnite (and ﬁnite) number of particles and/or antiparticles. These states are standard
in quantum ﬁeld theory calculations, but don’t cover exhaustively the possibilities one
could have in mind. For example, one could take into account coherent states, which
correspond to ﬁeld states as near as possible to classical states of the ﬁelds. This
consideration of coherent states, which appears to be of purely speculative interest in
the case of black holes, is instead of great interest in case of black hole analogues. Indeed,
in the case of dielectric black holes which are generated by means of the Kerr eﬀect,
a dielectric perturbation traveling in the dielectric medium plays the role of the black
hole, and is generated by a strong laser pulse. When a further weak laser probe is shot
against the probe pulse, one can obtain stimulated emission. A formal way to describe
the laser probe is by means of coherent states, which makes very strong and worthwhile
of direct physical application the interest in this topic.
We recall that a coherent state is deﬁned as an eigenstate of the annihilation operator.
For example, if ˆc is an annihilation operator, such that

ˆc|0 >= 0,

and [ˆc, ˆc†] = 1, then a coherent state |z > is such that

ˆc|z >= z|z >,

and also

∞(cid:88)

n=0

|n >

|z > = e−|z|2/2

zn
n!
= ezˆc†−z∗ˆc|0 >,
where |n >= c†n|0 > has norm
n!. We recall also that a Poissonian distribution
of particles corresponds to the coherent state, and also that coherent states can
be normalized (we assume that ours ones in the following are normalized) but not

√

(37)

(39)

orthogonal each other, and form an overcomplete set of states. Moreover, in a ﬁeld
theory framework, we should write [24]

|η >= e

(2π)32ωk

(η(kkk)ˆc†(kkk)−η∗(kkk)ˆc(kkk))|0 >,

(cid:82)

(cid:90)

with

(2π)32ωk

|η(kkk)|2 < ∞.

We recall that

ˆc(kkk)|η >= η(kkk)|η > .

(40)

(41)

(42)

However, in the following, we shall keep the discrete notation, in order to simplify the
presentation. Like in the previous section, we will work with a charged scalar ﬁeld,
obviously all results being immediately adaptable also to the case of neutral scalar ﬁeld,
in a straightforward way. In the charged ﬁeld two distinct annihilation operator types
appear: the a-type for particles and the b-type for antiparticles in the initial state ﬁeld
modes (and c-type and d-type for the outgoing ﬁeld modes). In line of principles, we
could consider a initial coherent state constructed as the tensor product of |ηIN > and
|¯ηIN >, where

|ηIN > = ηi|ηIN >,
|¯ηIN > = ¯ηi|¯ηIN >,

aIN
i
bIN

(43)

(44)

(we have omitted the suﬃx IN where no confusion is possible), so that the initial state
is simply

With respect to the case where a Fock initial state is considered, we face with a situation
where nondiagonal contributions appear.

By choosing the diagonal Bogoliubov transformation corresponding to the passage from
Hartle-Hawking modes to Boulware ones thermality emerges again. It is also interesting
to point out that (51) coincides with (15) under the same hypothesis of zero initial
antiparticles, due to the fact that |ηk|2 =< N IN

A bit long calculation shows that variance is diﬀerent in the two cases, and provides us
a simple tool for discriminating between the aforementioned physical situations.
We ﬁrst take into account the Fock space case. We note that the presence of a Bogoliubov
transformation makes nontrivial the result, in the sense that, even if trivially we have

4. Stimulated emission and the electromagnetic ﬁeld

The presence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is made more involved because of the gauge
invariance, requiring a suitable gauge ﬁxing, and the appearance, in the case e.g. of
a covariant gauge, of spurious degrees of freedom (scalar component and longitudinal
component of the ﬁeld) to be suitably taken into account. We do not delve into a detailed
discussion (for the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld on a manifold and in black
hole backgrounds see e.g. [21, 22, 23]), we limit ourselves to some basic considerations
which still shed light on stimulated emission in the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Our key-ansatz consists in assuming that, e.g. in a generalized Feynman gauge [22] it
is possible to separate two mutually orthogonal physical polarizations λ = 1, 2 in such
a way that they remain orthogonal to scalar and longitudinal polarizations. This is
ensured in the case of dielectric black holes, because asymptotic states are well-known
polariton states of standard ﬂat spacetime [19, 27, 28]. The polarization index appears
as a further label to be considered together with quantum number specifying solutions of
the homogeneous Maxwell equations in presence of a black hole. In this sense, there are
no substantial changes with respect to the (neutral) scalar ﬁeld case, for what concerns
the calculation of the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients. Indeed, one has e.g.

βλk,λ(cid:48)k(cid:48) = −(pλ(cid:48)k(cid:48)

, f λk∗

),

(62)

in a straightforward generalization of the scalar ﬁeld case. k stays for the set of labels
specifying solutions of the Maxwell equations, and it is interesting to stress that we are
only interested to the cases where λ, λ(cid:48) = 1, 2, i.e. only physical polarizations have to
be taken into account in order to calculate physical observables. Indeed, the remaining

Stimulated emission and Hawking radiation in black hole analogues

polarizations appear only in the set of unphysical variables, and do not participate any
physically relevant number operator. Then we obtain

In particular, in the thermal particle creation case one ﬁnds for the physical polarizations

As expected, the polarization does not aﬀect spontaneous emission, which is clearly
a unpolarized contribution. The two further terms, instead, depend on λ as far as
the initial particle and/or antiparticle states are polarized.

The ﬁrst contribution on the right side of both the above equations is the spontaneous
(unpolarized) contribution. The second one in (66) is the number of photons in the IN
state, and the third one in the same equation is the stimulated (polarized) contribution.
In (66) we ﬁnd, beyond the spontaneous contribution, a further polarized stimulated
term. In the limit for nIN

It is straightforward to generalize to the electromagnetic case our analysis involving

It is also straightforward to adapt our previous analysis concerning the variance to the
electromagnetic ﬁeld case.

In the case of stimulated Hawking eﬀect in dielectric media the ternary process
IN → P + N takes place, where IN stays for the initial state mode (incoming particle),
P labels the outgoing particle mode, and N the outgoing antiparticle mode [7, 9, 19]. In
ﬁgure 1 we display the typical situation in the case of the so-called Cauchy approximation
for the Sellmeier equation for a single resonance. We also point out that we work in
the comoving frame, i.e. in the frame of the laser pulse. There is a monotone branch,
which provides a state B which decouples from the spectrum in the case of not too stiﬀ
refractive index variation (see e.g.
[19]), and a non-monotone branch which is instead
deeply involved in the analogue Hawking eﬀect and provides three states IN, P, N .

Figure 1.
Asymptotic dispersion relation for the Cauchy approximation in the
comoving frame. The dashed line divides antiparticle states (below it) and particle
ones (above it). ω and k are the frequency and the wave number in the comoving
frame respectively. Two lines at ω =const and at −ω =const are also drawn, and
relevant states are explicitly indicated.

We stress that, in the comoving frame of the dielectric perturbation, we can adopt
as asymptotic states the unperturbed states of the covariant Hopﬁeld model we set up
in [27, 28]. In this case, physical polarizations are found in the framework we assumed
above (i.e. they are actually mutually orthogonal, and, in particular, orthogonal to the
longitudinal and scalar polarizations, which do not participate to the physical states).

Let us interpret the above results in terms of the observed P -peak (particle peak) and
N -peak (antiparticle peak). Our considerations are limited to the case where thermality
occurs and no relevant contribution to the scattering process of the fourth mode involved
in the process, called B-mode, appears. (66) represents the mean number of photons in
the P -peak, whereas (67) stays for the number of antiparticles in the N -peak. As
it is evident, in the P -peak we ﬁnd the initial state photons (i.e. photons in the
state IN ), and, as an eﬀect of the thermal particle creation, of the stimulated and
spontaneous created particles.
In the N -peak, we ﬁnd stimulated and spontaneous
created antiparticles. We have that the pair-created photons participate both the
peaks, the particle modes joining the P -peak together with the IN -photons, and the
antiparticle modes forming the N -peak, which represents a clear signal of ampliﬁcation
(pair creation). As to the polarization, we note that both the peaks, as far as the
stimulated contribution becomes the leading one, are polarized. In particular, polarized
IN -photons generate particles and antiparticles with the same polarization as for the
IN -photons.‡

5. Conclusions

We have reconsidered stimulated emission in a black hole context, in light of the fact
that analogue gravity allows a relevant role for stimulated emission, in spite of its
substantial practical irrelevance for astrophysical black holes. We have recalled existing
results for black holes, and we have pointed out as, in the case of Hartle-Hawking state,
stimulated emission can be calculated in a thermoﬁeld dynamics framework. Then, we
have considered coherent states as possible initial states, in view of the possibility in a
dielectric black hole case to stimulate Hawking-like emission by means of a laser probe.
Then we have also extended the results to the case of electromagnetic ﬁeld, which, under
reasonable hypotheses, are (non-trivial) extensions of the standard scalar ﬁeld results.
Finally, we have applied our analysis to the dielectric black hole case. The created pairs
are such that one emitted photon is found in the P mode peak and the companion
photon (antiparticle) is found in the N mode peak. The spontaneous contribution is
unpolarized, as it should be due to thermality of the spontaneous radiation, whereas the
stimulated one is suitably polarized, in such a way that a created photon is polarized
in the same way as the stimulating particle state, and is polarized in the opposite way
as the stimulating antiparticle state. As a consequence, given an IN state populated by
particle states, one obtains a P mode peak and an N mode peak, all having the same
polarization.

‡ Obviously particles and antiparticles initially have opposite phases, but in terms of experimental
observation this fact is irrelevant since in general the phases will change independently along the story
of the single particle.
