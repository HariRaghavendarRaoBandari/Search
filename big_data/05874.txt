Abstract

The paper is of scientiﬁc-methodical character. The classical soap
ﬁlm shape (minimal surface) problem is considered, the ﬁlm being
stretched between two parallel coaxial rings. An analytical approach
based on relations to the Sturm-Liouville problem is proposed. An
energy terms interpretation of the classical Goldschmidt condition is
discussed. Appearance of the soliton potential in course of the second
variation analysis is noticed.

Key words: soap ﬁlm shape (minimal surface) problem, critical case,
Goldschmidt condition, soliton potential.

Introduction

Setup

In the space endowed with the standard Cartesian coordinate system x, y, z,
there are two rings {(x, y, z) | x = ∓h, y2 + z2 = 1} . Between the rings,
a soap ﬁlm is stretched, the ﬁlm minimizing its area owing to the surface
stretch forces. By symmetry of the physical conditions, the ﬁlm takes the
shape of a rotation (around x-axis) surface, whereas to ﬁnd this shape is to
solve the well-known minimization problem for the functional

Sh[y] := 2πZ h

y(x)q1 + y′2(x) dx

y(−h) = y(h) = 1 .

(1.2)

The value h > 0, which is equal to the half-distance between the rings, plays
the role of the basic parameter. The goal of the paper is to study the behavior
of the solutions to the problem (1.1), (1.2) depending on h.

Results

In the above-mentioned or analogous setup, the given problem is considered
(at least on a formal level) in almost all manuals on the calculus of variations.
It is studied in detail in the monograph [3], whereas we deal with the version
of the manual [2], which will be commented on later. In our paper:
• a purely analytical way of solving the problem 1, which uses the well-known
facts of the Sturm-Liouville theory, is proposed
• the case of the critical value h = h∗ (such that the problem turns out to
be unsolvable for h > h∗) is studied in detail, the study invoking the third
variation of the functional Sh∗[y]
• a criticism of the arguments of [2] concerning to the Goldschmidt condition,
is provided; our own interpretation of the lack of solvability for h > h∗ based
on the energy considerations is proposed.
A noteworthy point is that, in course of studying the second variation of
the functional (1.1), the key role is played by the Sturm-Liouville equation
with 1-soliton potential. However, we didn’t succeed in ﬁnding a satisfactory
explanation for this fact.

2 Extremum investigation

Extremals

Let us recall the well-known facts. The extremals of the functional (1.1)
satisfy the Euler equation

Fy −

d
dx

Fy′ = 0 ,

where F (y, y′) := yp1 + y′2. It possesses the ﬁrst integral F − y′Fy′ = C;

the consequent integration provides the solutions of the form y(x, C1, C2) =
C1ch x+C2
. The conditions (1.2) easily imply C2 = 0, which leads to the
C1
1-parameter family of the extremals

y(x, C) = Cch

C > 0 .

The functional value at an extremal is found by integration:

Substituting x = h to (2.1) with regard to (1.2), one gets the equation

C = 1 for determination of the constant C, which can be written in the
form

φ(τ ) =

where

Elementary analysis provides the following facts.
• The function φ is downward convex, whereas φ(τ ) → ∞ holds for τ → 0
and τ → ∞. It has only one positive minimum at the point τ = τ∗ determined
by the equality φ′(τ ) = 0. The latter is equivalent to a transcendent equation

1 − τ thτ = 0 .

(2.4)

• The equation (2.3) is solvable if h 6 h∗ only, where h∗ := 1
φ(τ∗). For h < h∗
it has two distinct roots τ1,2(h) : τ1(h) < τ2(h); for h = h∗ the roots coincide.
For h → 0 one has τ1(h) → 0 and τ2(h) → ∞, the relations

• The function τ1(h) deﬁned for 0 6 h 6 h∗ is invertible; the inverse function
is

For the latter, we have

(2.6)

In particular, the aforesaid shows that for h 6 h∗ the functional Sh[y]

possesses two extremals

which are distinct if h < h∗ and coincide if h = h∗. For h > h∗, the functional
Sh[y] does not possess extremals. On ﬁg 2, the graphs of extremals are shown
for a small, intermediate, and critical values of the distance h.

Substituting (2.7) to (2.1), one gets the equalities

By them, with regard to (2.5), one easily derives the relations

lim
h→0

Sh[y1] = 0 ,

lim
h→0

Sh[y2] = 2π .

Some additional analysis implies

Sh[y1] < Sh[y2] ,

0 < h < h∗,

(2.9)

wheraes Sh∗[y1] = Sh∗[y2] holds by coincidence of the extremals for h = h∗
(see ﬁg 3).

Second variation

Testing the extremals on the presence of extremum, we use the Taylor rep-
resentation

Sh[y + tη] =
t ∼ 0

Sh[y] + tδSh[y; h] + t2δ2Sh[y; h] + t3δ3Sh[y; h] + o(t3) (2.10)

2 and, in particular, the second variation. Its general form at the extremals
(2.1) is derived by the straightforward diﬀerentiation:

δ2Sh[y; η] :=

2! (cid:20) d2

Sh[y + tη](cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

variable s = x

(2.11)

2here, for the extremals y, one has δSh[y; h] = 0

6

and integrating by parts with regard to ψ(−τ ) = ψ(τ ) = 0, after some simple
calculation we get

δ2Sh[y; η] = αZ τ

−τ(cid:20)ψ′2(s) −

ch2s

ψ2(s)(cid:21) ds ,

(2.12)

where α = const > 0.

Let us consider the integral in (2.12) as a functional of ψ. For it, the
corresponding Euler equation takes the form of the Sturm-Liouville equation

ψ′′ +

2

ch2s

ψ = 0

(2.13)

with the soliton potential q = 2
ch2s . We did not succeed to recognize, whether
it appears in the given problem just by occasion, or there is a deeper reason
for that.

We study the second variation by the use of the special solution to (2.13)

of the form

µ(s) := 1 − s ths .

(2.14)

It is distinguished by the conditions µ(0) = 1 and µ(−s) = µ(s), has the
ordinary roots τ = ∓τ∗ (see (2.4)), and is positive in the interval (−τ∗, τ∗).
Recall that, outside its roots, any solution to the equation u′′+qu = 0 satisﬁes
the well-known Riccati equation

u(cid:21)′
(cid:20) u′

u(cid:21)2
+(cid:20) u′

= −q .

Applying this to the solution µ, we have

µ(cid:21)′
(cid:20) µ′

µ(cid:21)2

(2.15)

Therefore, for |τ | < τ∗ (outside the roots of µ) the following transformations
of the integral in (2.12) turn out to be quite correct:

Z τ

Integrating by parts in the equality (∗), one uses the boundary conditions
ψ(∓τ ) = 0. The same conditions yield that ψ
µ is bounded as |s| 6 τ∗, what
enables one to justify the derivation also in the case τ = τ∗.

As a consequence, for the second variation (2.12) on any test function η,

we have:

δ2Sh[y; η] = β Z τ

(2.16)

the equality δ2Sh[y; η] = 0 (for τ = τ∗) being valid only on the function η,
which corresponds (in the meaning of (2.11)) to the function ψ = cµ with a
constant c 6= 0.

Extremal y1

Fix an h < h∗; for it, the equality τ1(h) < τ∗ holds. By the latter, the
representation (2.16) is valid with τ < τ∗ that implies

δ2Sh[y1; η] > 0

for any test function η. Consequently, on the extremal y1 the functional Sh[y]
does attain a minimum. Its minimal value is determined by (2.8). As is seen
from (2.9), this minimum is local (is not global).

Extremal y2

For h < h∗, one has τ2(h) > τ∗ and the representation (2.16) becomes invalid.
Let us show that the variation δ2Sh[y2; η] turns out to be sign-indeﬁnite and
takes negative values on appropriate η.

Consider the boundary value spectral problem

points. Here τ is a parameter. Recall the well-known facts (see, e.g., [1]).

• The problem possesses the ordinary discrete spectrum {λk(τ )}k>1:

0 < λ1(τ ) < λ2(τ ) < . . . ,

λk(τ ) →
k→∞

8

whereas the corresponding eigenfunctions {ψk(· ; τ )}k>1 constitute an orthog-
onal basis of the space L2, ρ(−τ, τ ).
• The relation dλk(τ )

• The ﬁrst (minimal) eigenvalue is

where H 1
For τ → 0 one has λ1(τ ) → ∞.
• The eigenfunction ψ1 has no roots in −τ < s < τ . The functions ψk of the
numbers k > 2 do have the roots into this interval.
By the above mentioned facts, the behavior of the low bound of the string
spectrun is the following. For τ ∼ 0, we have λ1(τ ) ≫ 1. As τ grows, the
value of λ1(τ ) is decreasing, whereas for τ = τ∗ one has λ1(τ∗) = 1 and
Indeed, for τ = τ∗ the equation (2.13) 3 possesses the solution
ψ1 = cµ.
ψ = µ, which satisﬁes the conditions (2.18), i.e., is an eigenfunction of the
string corresponding to λ = 1. It is namely the ﬁrst eigenfunction since µ
has no roots into (−τ∗, τ∗).

Further, for τ > τ∗, by monotonicity of the eigenvalues, we have λ1(τ ) <

1. Therefore, by (2.19), there is a function ψ0 ∈ H 1

0 [−τ, τ ] satisfying

Therefore, for the function η0 related with ψ0 via the relation (2.11), by
virtue of (2.12) one has:

δ2Sh[y2; η0] < 0 .

Hence, the extremal y2 provides no extremum to the functional Sh[y].

3which is the same as the equation (2.17) with λ = 1

Critical case

The previous considerations deal with the case h < h∗. Now, let h = h∗, so
that the extremals do coincide:

3 Comments

On the Goldschmidt condition

For h > h∗, the functional (1.1) with the conditions (1.2) does not have
extremals at all. In [2] (chapter 17, section 2), this fact is accomplished with
the following qualitative explanation.

10

Figure 3:

As h grows, the area o the ﬁlm is growing. For suﬃciently big h, by
energy reasons, it turns out to be more proﬁtable for the ﬁlm to ﬁll the both
of the rings separately and, so, take the total area π12 + π12 = 2π. By this,
the ﬁlm breaks, whereas the critical area value turns out to be 2π, which is
declared as the Goldschmidt break condition.

The given explanation is incorrect 4. Deﬁning the ‘Goldschmidt constant’
hG as the solution of the equation Sh[y1] = 2π (with respect to h), it is easy
to recognize that it is solvable and

0.5277... = hG < h∗ = 0.6627... ,

so that the corresponding extremal y1 does exist and describes a stable pre-
critical shape of the ﬁlm: see ﬁg 3.

Probably, the incorrect explanation is just a result of confusion. In the
ﬁrst exercise at the end of the section (page 689), the reader is proposed ‘to
ﬁnd such a value of h that the rotation surface area is equal to the total area
of the end rings’.

Physical considerations

Is the value h = h∗ distinguished from a physical viewpoint? Bellow we
propose a variant of the answer on this question.

Let h < h∗ and the ﬁlm be of the shape described by the extremal y1.
Contacting with the rings, the ﬁlm inﬂuences on them by the surface stretch

forces, the rings being attracted with each other. As the distance between
them grows, the system accumulates a potential energy. In the framework of
the model under consideration, one can assume the potential energy of the
stretch forces to be proportional to the ﬁlm area Sh[y1]. The derivative

−

dSh[y1]

dh

=: F (h)

may be naturally 5 interpreted as a force of the rings attraction. Let us ﬁnd
its value.

Denoting R(τ ) := 2

τ + sh2τ

τ 2

, we have Sh[y1]

to

(2.8)
= πh2R(τ1(h)) that follows

F (h) = − 2πhR(τ1(h)) − πh2R′(τ1(h))τ ′

1(h) .

Implementing the diﬀerentiation in the right hand side, after the simple trans-
formations with regard to the ﬁrst of the equalities (2.6), we get

F (h) = − 4π

h

τ1(h)

.

Diﬀerentiating one more time, we arrive at the relations

F ′(h) = − 4π

τ1(h) − hτ ′
τ 2
1 (h)

1(h)

(2.6)
→
h→h∗

∞ .

Such a behavior motivates to regard the value h = h∗ as critical: one may
assume that it is the inﬁnite velocity of the force growing, which leads to the
break of the ﬁlm, and forbids its existence for h > h∗.
