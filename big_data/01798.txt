Parallel extragradient - viscosity methods for equilibrium
problems and ﬁxed point problems

Dang Van Hieu

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract In this paper, we propose two parallel extragradient - viscosity methods for ﬁnd-
ing a particular element in the common solution set of a system of equilibrium problems
and ﬁnitely many ﬁxed point problems. This particular point is the unique solution of a vari-
ational inequality problem on the common solution set. The main idea of the paper is to
combine three methods including the extragradient method, the Mann iteration method, the
hybrid steepest-descent method with the parallel splitting-up technique to design the algo-
rithms which improve the performance over some existing methods. The strongly convergent
theorems are established under the widely used assumptions for equilibrium bifunctions.

1 Introduction

Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of a real Hilbert space H. Let f : C ×C → ´
a bifunction. The equilibrium problem (EP) for f on C is to ﬁnd x∗ ∈ C such that

f (x∗, y) ≥ 0, ∀y ∈ C.

be

The solution set of EP (1) is denoted by EP( f ,C). Mathematically, EP is a generalization of
many mathematical models including variational inequality problems (VIP), optimization
problems and ﬁxed point problems (FPP), nonlinear and linear complemetarity problems,
vector minimization problems and Nash equilibria problems, see for instance [5,9,16,17].
Due to this reason, EP has been recieved a lot of attention by many authors. Some notable
methods for studying and solving EPs are the proximal point method [16,24], the splitting
proximal method [22], the extragradient method and the Armijo linesearch method [23], the
gradient-like projection method [15], the hybrid extragradient method [1,10], the extragra-
dient - viscosity method [25].

Let S : C → C be a mapping. Let us denote Fix(S) by the ﬁxed point set of S, i.e.,
Fix(S) = {x ∈ C : x = S(x)}. The problem of ﬁnding a common element of the ﬁxed point
set of a mapping and the solution set of an equilibrium problem is a task arising in various
ﬁelds of applicable mathematics, sciences, engineering and economy, for example [9]. In
[10], the authors presented a model which comes from Nash-Cournot model [9] for ﬁnding
a point in the solution set EP( f ,C)∩Fix(S). As a further extension, in this paper we consider
the following common solution problem.
Problem 1 Find an element x∗ ∈ W

:= (∩i∈IEP( fi,C))T (∩ j∈JFix(S j)), where fi : C ×C →

, i ∈ I = {1, 2, . . . , N} are bifunctions and S j : C → C, j ∈ J = {1, 2, . . . , M} are mappings.

In recent years, the problem of ﬁnding a common solution of EPs and/or VIPs and FPPs
has been widely and intensively studied by many authors, for example [6,2,3,4,7,8,11,10,
12,14]. Problem 1 includes many previously considered problems. When S j = I for all j,
Problem 1 becomes the problem of ﬁnding a common solution to EPs which was introduced
and studied by Combettes and Hirstoaga in [6]. Using the resolvent of a bifunction, the au-
thors proposed a general block-iterative algorithm for ﬁnding a common solution of EPs.
A special case of this problem is the common solutions to variational inequalities problem
(CSVIP) mentioned and analyzed intensively in [8] where the authors proposed an algorithm
for CSVIP which combines the extragradient method [18] with the hybrid (outer approxi-
mation) method. In a very recent work [10], Problem 1 has been studied and analyzed in
the case M, N > 1, the authors in [10] proposed some parallel hybrid extragradient methods
which combine the extended extragradient method [23], the Mann or Halpern iterations, the
parallel splitting-up technique [11] and the outer approximation method (hybrid method). A
notable problem in these algorithms is that at each iteration we must construct two closed
convex subsets Cn, Qn of the feasible set C and compute the next approximation being the
projection of the starting point x0 on the intersection Cn ∩ Qn. These can be costly and affect
the efﬁciency of the used method.

On the other hand, for ﬁnding a particular solution of Problem 1 when M = N = 1,
Maing´e and Moudaﬁ [21] introduced the variational inequality problem: Find x∗ ∈ EP( f ,C)∩
Fix(S) such that

hF(x∗), y − x∗i ≥ 0, ∀y ∈ EP( f ,C) ∩ Fix(S),

(2)

where F : C → H is h
positive constants h and L such that, for all x, y ∈ C,

- strongly monotone and L - Lipschitz continuous, i.e., there two

hF(x) − F(y), x − yi ≥ h ||x − y||2,

||F(x) − F(y)|| ≤ L||x − y||.

Using the proximal point method for EP and the hybrid steepest - descent method introduced
by Yamada and Ogura in [26], Maing´e and Moudaﬁ [21] proposed the following iterative
method for VIP (2): Choose x0 ∈ C and

(zn ∈ C such that f (zn, y) + 1

xn+1 = (1 − w)tn + wStn with tn = zn − a nFzn,

hy − zn, zn − xni ≥ 0, ∀y ∈ C,

rn

(3)

where w, rn, a n are suitable parameters. Recently, with the same idea, Vuong et al. [25] have
replaced the proximal point method by the extragradient method [1,23] for computing zn in

´

(3) and proposed the following extragradient - viscosity method for VIP (2): Choose x0 ∈ C
and



yn = argmin{r
2 ||xn − y||2 : y ∈ C},
zn = argmin{r
2 ||xn − y||2 : y ∈ C},
xn+1 = (1 − w)tn + wStn with tn = zn − a nFzn,

f (xn, y) + 1
f (yn, y) + 1

(4)

where w, r , a n are suitable parameters. The advantage of using the viscosity method is that
it gives us strongly convergent algorithms which have more simple and elegant structures.

In this paper, motivated and inspired by the results in [10,25,21], we propose two paral-
lel algorithms for Problem 1 which do not require constructing two set Cn, Qn and computing
the projection onto their intersection per each iteration as in [10]. As the idea of Maing´e and
Moudaﬁ [21], Vuong et al. [25], we also ﬁnd a particular solution x∗ of Problem 1 which
satisﬁes the following variational inequality problem:

hF(x∗), y − x∗i ≥ 0, ∀y ∈ W

,

(5)

where F : C → H is h
- strongly monotone and L - Lipschitz continuous. Let us denote
V IP(F,W ) by the solution set of VIP (5). Note that if F(x) = x − u with u being a suggested
point in H then VIP (5) reduces to the problem of ﬁnding an element x∗ ∈ W which is the
best approximation of u, i.e., x∗ = PW (u). Firstly, using the extragradient method, we ﬁnd
semultaneously intermediate approximations for each equilibrium problems in the family.
After that, among obtained approximations, the furthest one from the previous iterate is
chosen. Based on this element, we compute in parallel other intermediate iterates for ﬁxed
point problems in this family. Similarly, we deﬁned the next iterate and obtain the ﬁrst
algorithm. Next, as an improvement of ﬁnding furthest approximations in the ﬁrst algorithm,
we use convex combinations of component intermediate approximations and propose the
second parallel algorithm. In our numerical experiments, with the ﬁrst way, we see that the
obtained algorithm seems to be more effective than the second one and hybrid methods
proposed in [10]. Some advantages of this performance in comparing with that of cyclic
methods, specially when the numbers of subproblems N, M are large, can be found in [3,4,
10,13] and several references therein.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we recall some deﬁnitions and preliminary
results for the further use. Sec. 3 deals with proposing the algorithms and proving their
convergence. Finally, in Sec. 4 we present a numerical example to illustrate the convergence
of our algorithms and compare them with the parallel hybrid method in [10].

2 Preliminaries

Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of a real Hilbert space H. We begin with some
deﬁnitions and properties of a demicontractive mapping.

Deﬁnition 2.1 A mapping S : C → C is called:

(i) nonexpansive if ||S(x) − S(y)|| ≤ ||x − y|| for all x, y ∈ C.
(ii) quasi-nonexpansive if Fix(S) 6= /0 and

||S(x) − x∗|| ≤ ||x − x∗||, ∀x∗ ∈ Fix(S), ∀x ∈ C.

(iii) b

- demicontractive if Fix(S) 6= /0, and there exists b ∈ [0, 1) such that

||S(x) − x∗||2 ≤ ||x − x∗||2 + b ||x − S(x)||2, ∀x∗ ∈ Fix(S), ∀x ∈ C.

4

D.V. Hieu

(iv) demiclosed at zero if, for each sequence {xn} ⊂ C, xn ⇀ x, and ||S(xn) − xn|| → 0 then

S(x) = x.

From the deﬁnitions above, we see that (i) =⇒ (ii) =⇒ (iii). It is well-known that each
nonexpansive mapping is demiclosed at zero. Problem 1 was considered in [10] for nonex-
pansive mappings. In this paper, for more ﬂexibility, we consider the mappings S j,
j ∈ J
being demicontractive. We have the following result for a demicontractive mapping.
Lemma 2.1 [20, Remark 4.2] Assume that S : C → C be a b
such that Fix(S) 6= /0. Then
(i) Sw = (1 − w)I + wS is a quasi-nonexpensive mapping over C for every w ∈ [0, 1 − k ].

- demicontractive mapping

Furthermore

||Swx − x∗|| ≤ ||x − x∗||2 − w(1 − b − w)||Sx − x||2, ∀x∗ ∈ Fix(S), ∀x ∈ C.

(ii) Fix(S) is closed and convex.

Next, we present some concepts of the monotonicity of a bifunction.
Deﬁnition 2.2 [5] A bifunction f : C ×C → ´

is said to be

(i) monotone on C if

(ii) pseudomonotone on C if

f (x, y) + f (y, x) ≤ 0, ∀x, y ∈ C;

f (x, y) ≥ 0 =⇒ f (y, x) ≤ 0, ∀x, y ∈ C;

(iii) Lipschitz-type continuous on C if there exist two positive constants c1, c2 such that

f (x, y) + f (y, z) ≥ f (x, z) − c1||x − y||2 − c2||y − z||2, ∀x, y, z ∈ C.

We have the following result about the operator F mentioned in Section 1.
Lemma 2.2 (cf. [26, Lemma 3.1]) Suppose that F : C → H is h

||x − y||2 + m 2L||x − y||2

This yields the desired conclusion. Next, we prove claim (ii) in this lemma. From the deﬁtion

Finally, we have the following technical lemma.
Lemma 2.3 [20, Remark 4.4] Let {e n} be a sequence of non-negative real numbers. Sup-
pose that for any integer m, there exists an integer p such that p ≥ m and e p ≤ e p+1. Let n0
be an integer such that e n0 ≤ e n0+1 and deﬁne, for all integer n ≥ n0,
t (n) = max {k ∈ N : n0 ≤ k ≤ n, e k ≤ e k+1} .

Then 0 ≤ e n ≤ e t (n)+1 for all n ≥ n0. Furthermore, the sequence {t (n)}n≥n0

also write ¯yn := yin

Hypothesis A2 was introduced by Mastroeni in [19]. It is necessary to imply the conver-
gence of the auxiliary principle method for EPs. If A : C → H is a L - Lipschitz continuous
operator then the bifunction f (x, y) = hA(x), y − xi satisﬁes hypothesis A2. It is easy to show
that if fi satisﬁes conditions A1-A4 then EP( fi,C) is closed and convex (see, for instance
[23]). Under Condition 2, from Lemma 2.1, Fix(S j) is closed and convex. Thus, W
is also
convex and closed. In this paper, we assume that W
is nonempty. Hence, it follows from the
assumptions of the operator F that VIP (5) has the unique solution on W
, denoted by x∗. We
need the following lemmas.

Theorem 3.1 Assume that Conditions 1, 2, 3 hold and the operator F : C → H is h
-
strongly monotone and L - Lipschitz continuous. In addition, the set W
is nonempty. Then,
the sequence {xn} generated by Algorithm 3.1 converges strongly to the unique solution x∗
of VIP for F on W

Proof Since {xn}, {¯zn} are bounded and F is L - Lipschitz continuous, there exists a constant
K > 0 such that

2 |hxn+1 − x∗, F(¯zn)i| ≤ K.

We consider two cases.
Case 1. There exists n0 such that {e n} is decreasing for all n ≥ n0. Thus, from e n ≥ 0 for all
n ≥ 0, there exists the limit of {e n}, i.e., e n → e ≥ 0 as n → ¥
. Hence, it follows from (16),
the hypothesis of r and a n → 0 that

|| ¯yn − xn|| → 0, || ¯yn − ¯zn|| → 0, ||xn+1 − ¯zn|| → 0.

From the relation (17) and the triangle inequality, we obtain

||xn+1 − xn|| → 0, ||¯zn − xn|| → 0.

(17)

(18)

From the deﬁnition of ¯zn, we obtain ||zi
implies that

n − xn|| ≤ ||¯zn − xn||, ∀i ∈ I. This together with (18)

||zi

n − xn|| → 0, ∀i ∈ I.

Since {¯zn} is bounded, without loss of generality, we can assume that there exists a subse-

||tm − ¯zm|| = a m||F(¯zm)|| → 0.

(23)

This together with (17) implies that ||xm+1 − tm|| → 0. Thus, it follows from (22) that ||tm −
S jtm|| → 0 and tm ⇀ p. Since S j is demiclosed at zero, p ∈ ∩ j∈JFix(S j). Hence, p ∈ W

.

In order to ﬁnish Case 1, we show that

e n = ||xn − x∗||2 → e = 0.
Since ||xn − ¯zn|| → 0, ||¯zn − x∗||2 → e . From (21), ¯zn ⇀ p ∈ W

and x∗ ∈ V IP(F,W ), one has

This together with ||xn+1 − ¯zn|| → 0, ||¯zn − x∗||2 → e and (24) implies that

Case 2. There exists a subsequence {e ni} of {xn} such that e ni ≤ e ni+1 for all i ≥ 0.
It follows from Lemma 2.3 that

where t (n) = max {k ∈ N : n0 ≤ k ≤ n, e k ≤ e k+1}. Furthermore, the sequence {t (n)}n≥n0

in which the last inequality is followed from the deﬁnition of xt (nk)+1. It follows from the

||tt (nk) − ¯zt (nk)|| = a t (nk)||F(¯zt (nk))|| → 0.

(35)

This together with (30) implies that ||xt (nk)+1 −tt (nk)|| → 0. Thus, from (34) and xt (nk)+1 ⇀

simpler than those of computing ¯zn and xn+1 in Steps 3, 4 of Algorithm 3.1. This is also
illustrated in our numerical experiments in Sec. 4 where time for execution of this algorithm
is less consuming than Algorithm 3.1 and the parallel hybrid extragradient method in [10].
In order to obtain the convergence of Algorithm 3.2, we install the following condition on

It follows from Lemma 2.3 that

e t (n) ≤ e t (n)+1, e n ≤ e t (n)+1, ∀n ≥ n0.

In this section, we perform a numerical example to illustrate the convergence of Algorithms

(47)
where qi ∈ ´ m (m = 10) and Pi, Qi are matrices of order m such that Qi is symmetric, posi-
tive semideﬁnite and Qi −Pi is negative semideﬁnite. The feasible set C ∈ ´ m is a polyhedral
convex set as

C = {x ∈ ´ m : Ax ≤ b} ,

where A ∈ ´ m×k is a matrix and b is a positive vector in ´

{1, 2, . . . , 20} be half-spaces deﬁned by Tj =(cid:8)x ∈ ´ m :(cid:10)x, h j(cid:11) ≤ l j(cid:9), where h j ∈ ´ m and l j

and ∩ j∈JFix(S j) = C ∩ (∩ j∈JH j). With choosing b and l j above, then 0 ∈ ∩ j∈JFix(S j), thus

. To check whether {xn} converges to x∗ = 0 or not, we use the function Dn = ||xn −x∗||
for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The convergence of {Dn} to 0 implies that {xn} converges to the solution

n+1 , the convergence rate of Algorithm
3.1 is better than the case a n = 1
(n+1)0.5 and the obtained tolerance is Dn < 10−5 after 1000
ﬁrst iterations. The times for execution of Algorithm 3.1 are smaller those of PHEM in two
cases. The reason for this is that in Algorithm 3.1, we do not need to construct two sets
Cn and Qn and ﬁnd the projection onto their intersection. For Algorithm 3.2, although the
convergence rate is the slowest, but the times for execution is the smallest. This is obvious
because in Algorithm 3.2 we have not to ﬁnd the furthest approximations and construct two
set Cn and Qn per each iteration. This algorithm is the simplest in computing.

5 Concluding

In this paper, we have proposed two parallel extragradient - viscosity methods for ﬁnding a
particular common solution of a ﬁnite family of equilibrium problems for pseudomonotone
and Lipschitz-type continuous bifunctions and a ﬁnite family of ﬁxed point problems for
demicontractive mappings. The considered particular element is the unique solution of a
variational inequality problem on the common solution set of two families. The proposed
algorithms can be considered as improvements of some previously known hybrid methods

in computations. A numerical example is performed to illustrate the convergence of the
algorithms and compare them with the parallel hybrid extragradient method.
