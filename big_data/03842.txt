ON HEREDITARY PROPERTIES OF QUANTUM GROUP

AMENABILITY

JASON CRANN

Abstract. Given a locally compact quantum group G and a closed quantum
subgroup H, we show that G is amenable if and only if H is amenable and G
acts amenably on the quantum homogenous space G/H. We also study the
existence of L1( bG)-module projections from L∞( bG) onto L∞( bH).

1. Introduction

Let G be a locally compact group. If G is amenable, it is well-known that any
closed subgroup H of G is amenable and that G acts amenably on the homogenous
space G/H in the sense that there is a G-invariant state m ∈ L∞(G/H)∗. Con-
versely, if H is an amenable closed subgroup of G for which G acts amenably on
G/H, then G is necessarily amenable. We show that this fundamental hereditary
property of amenability persists at the level of locally compact quantum groups
using a recent homological characterization amenability [3, Theorem 5.2], which
states that a locally compact quantum group G is amenable if and only if its dual

L∞(bG) is 1-injective as an operator module over L1(bG).

The existence of (completely) bounded A(G)-module projections P : V N (G) →
V N (H) has been a recent topic of interest in harmonic analysis [8, 9, 12, 15]. In
particular, it was shown in [9, Theoerem 12] that if H is amenable, then a bounded
A(G)-module projection always exists. We show that this projection may be taken
completely contractive, and, in addition, that such a projection exists for a large
class of locally compact quantum groups.

2. Preliminaries

Let A be a complete contractive Banach algebra. We say that an operator
space X is a right operator A-module if it is a right Banach A-module such that

the module map mX : Xb⊗A → X is completely contractive, where b⊗ denotes the

operator space projective tensor product. We say that X is faithful if for every non-
zero x ∈ X, there is a ∈ A such that x · a 6= 0. We denote by mod − A the category
of right operator A-modules with morphisms given by completely bounded module
homomorphisms. Left operator A-modules and operator A-bimodules are deﬁned
similarly, and we denote the respective categories by A − mod and A − mod − A.
Let A be a completely contractive Banach algebra and X ∈ mod − A. The
identiﬁcation A+ = A ⊕1 C turns the unitization of A into a unital completely

contractive Banach algebra, and it follows that X becomes a right operator A+-
module via the extended action

x · (a + λe) = x · a + λx,

a ∈ A+, λ ∈ C, x ∈ X.

There is a canonical completely contractive morphism ∆+ : X → CB(A+, X) given
by

where the right A-module structure on CB(A+, X) is deﬁned by

∆+(x)(a) = x · a,

x ∈ X, a ∈ A+,

(Ψ · a)(b) = Ψ(ab),

a ∈ A, Ψ ∈ CB(A+, X), b ∈ A+.

An analogous construction exists for objects in A − mod. Let C ≥ 1. We say that
X is relatively C-injective if there exists a morphism Φ+ : CB(A+, X) → X such
that Φ+ ◦ ∆+ = idX and kΦ+kcb ≤ C. When X is faithful, this is equivalent to the
existence a morphism Φ : CB(A, X) → X such that Φ ◦ ∆ = idX and kΦkcb ≤ C
by the operator analogue of [5, Proposition 1.7], where ∆(x)(a) := ∆+(x)(a) for
x ∈ X and a ∈ A. We say that X is C-injective if for every Y, Z ∈ mod − A, every
completely isometric morphism Ψ : Y ֒→ Z, and every morphism Φ : Y → X, there

exists a morphism eΦ : Z → X such that keΦkcb ≤ CkΦkcb and eΦ ◦ Ψ = Φ.

A locally compact quantum group is a quadruple G = (L∞(G), Γ, ϕ, ψ), where
L∞(G) is a Hopf-von Neumann algebra with co-multiplication Γ : L∞(G) →
L∞(G)⊗L∞(G), and ϕ and ψ are ﬁxed left and right Haar weights on L∞(G),
respectively [17, 19]. For every locally compact quantum group G, there exists a
left fundamental unitary operator W on L2(G, ϕ) ⊗ L2(G, ϕ) and a right fundamen-
tal unitary operator V on L2(G, ψ) ⊗ L2(G, ψ) implementing the co-multiplication
Γ via

Γ(x) = W ∗(1 ⊗ x)W = V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗,

x ∈ L∞(G).

Both unitaries satisfy the pentagonal relation; that is,

(2.1)

W12W13W23 = W23W12

and

V12V13V23 = V23V12.

By [17, Proposition 2.11], we may identify L2(G, ϕ) and L2(G, ψ), so we will simply
use L2(G) for this Hilbert space throughout the paper. We denote by R the unitary
antipode of G.

Let L1(G) denote the predual of L∞(G). Then the pre-adjoint of Γ induces an

associative completely contractive multiplication on L1(G), deﬁned by

The canonical L1(G)-bimodule structure on L∞(G) is given by

⋆ : L1(G)b⊗L1(G) ∋ f ⊗ g 7→ f ⋆ g = Γ∗(f ⊗ g) ∈ L1(G).

f ⋆ x = (id ⊗ f )Γ(x),

x ⋆ f = (f ⊗ id)Γ(x),

x ∈ L∞(G), f ∈ L1(G).

A Left invariant mean on L∞(G) is a state m ∈ L∞(G)∗ satisfying

(2.2)

hm, x ⋆ f i = hf, 1ihm, xi,

x ∈ L∞(G), f ∈ L1(G).

Right and two-sided invariant means are deﬁned similarly. A locally compact quan-
tum group G is said to be amenable if there exists a left invariant mean on L∞(G).
It is known that G is amenable if and only if there exists a right (equivalently,
two-sided) invariant mean (cf. [10, Proposition 3]). We say that G is co-amenable
if L1(G) has a bounded left (equivalently, right or two-sided) approximate identity
(cf. [1, Theorem 3.1]).

The left regular representation λ : L1(G) → B(L2(G)) of G is deﬁned by

λ(f ) = (f ⊗ id)(W ),

f ∈ L1(G),

and is an injective, completely contractive homomorphism from L1(G) into B(L2(G)).

Then L∞(bG) := {λ(f ) : f ∈ L1(G)}′′ is the von Neumann algebra associated with
the dual quantum group bG. Analogously, we have the right regular representation

ρ : L1(G) → B(L2(G)) deﬁned by

ρ(f ) = (id ⊗ f )(V ),

f ∈ L1(G),

which is also an injective, completely contractive homomorphism from L1(G) into

B(L2(G)). Then L∞(bG′) := {ρ(f ) : f ∈ L1(G)}′′ is the von Neumann alge-
bra associated to the quantum group bG′.
It follows that L∞(bG′) = L∞(bG)′,
and the left and right fundamental unitaries satisfy W ∈ L∞(G)⊗L∞(bG) and
V ∈ L∞(bG′)⊗L∞(G) [17, Proposition 2.15]. Moreover, dual quantum groups al-
ways satisfy L∞(G) ∩ L∞(bG) = L∞(G) ∩ L∞(bG′) = C1 [21, Proposition 3.4].

If G is a locally compact group, we let Ga = (L∞(G), Γa, ϕa, ψa) denote the com-
mutative quantum group associated with the commutative von Neumann algebra
L∞(G), where the co-multiplication is given by Γa(f )(s, t) = f (st), and ϕa and ψa
are integration with respect to a left and right Haar measure, respectively. The dual

bGa of Ga is the co-commutative quantum group Gs = (V N (G), Γs, ϕs, ψs), where

V N (G) is the left group von Neumann algebra with co-multiplication Γs(λ(t)) =
λ(t) ⊗ λ(t), and ϕs = ψs is Haagerup’s Plancherel weight. Then L1(Ga) is the usual
group convolution algebra L1(G), and L1(Gs) is the Fourier algebra A(G). A com-
mutative quantum group is amenable if and only if its underlying locally compact
group is amenable, while co-commutative quantum groups are always amenable.

For general locally compact quantum groups G, the left and right fundamental

unitaries yield canonical extensions of the co-multiplication given by
Γl : B(L2(G)) ∋ T 7→ W ∗(1 ⊗ T )W ∈ L∞(G)⊗B(L2(G));
Γr : B(L2(G)) ∋ T 7→ V (T ⊗ 1)V ∗ ∈ B(L2(G))⊗L∞(G).

In turn, we obtain a canonical L1(G)-bimodule structure on B(L2(G)) with respect
to the actions

f (cid:3) T = (id ⊗ f )Γr(T ), T (cid:1) f = (f ⊗ id)Γl(T )

f ∈ L1(G), T ∈ B(L2(G)).

3. Closed Quantum Subgroups and Amenability

Let G and H be two locally compact quantum groups. Then H is said to be a
closed quantum subgroup of G in the sense of Vaes if there exists a normal, unital,

injective *-homomorphism γ : L∞(bH) → L∞(bG) satisfying

(γ ⊗ γ) ◦ Γ bH = Γ bG ◦ γ.

(3.1)

This is not the original deﬁnition of Vaes [20, Deﬁnition 2.5], but was shown to
be equivalent in [7, Theorem 3.3]. With this deﬁnition, we have an analog of the

Herz restriction theorem [13] for quantum groups, that is, γ∗ : L1(bG) → L1(bH) is

a complete quotient map [7, Theorem 3.7]. Indeed, if G and H are commutative,
with underlying locally compact groups G and H, the map γ is nothing but the
canonical inclusion

V N (H) ∋ λH (s) 7→ λG(s) ∈ V N (G),

4

JASON CRANN

where λH and λG are the left regular representations of H and G, respectively. Its
pre-adjoint γ∗ is then the canonical quotient map A(G) → A(H) arising from the
classical Herz restriction theorem.

Remark 3.1. There is an a priori weaker notion of closed quantum subgroup of a
locally compact quantum group due to Woronowicz [7, Deﬁnition 3.2].
In what
follows, we restrict ourselves to Vaes’ deﬁnition, so that a closed quantum subgroup
of a locally compact quantum group will always refer to the deﬁnition (3.1) given
above.

Given a closed quantum subgroup H of a locally compact quantum group G, we

let L∞(G/H) := γ(L∞(bH))′ ∩ L∞(G) represent the quantum homogenous space

G/H. By the left version of [16, Proposition 3.5] it follows that Γ(L∞(G/H)) ⊆
L∞(G/H)⊗L∞(G). Hence, L∞(G/H) is a left operator L1(G)-submodule of L∞(G)
under the action

f ⋆ x = (id ⊗ f )Γ(x),

x ∈ L∞(G/H), f ∈ L1(G).

We say that G acts amenably on G/H if there exists a state m ∈ L∞(G/H)∗
satisfying

hm, f ⋆ xi = hf, 1ihm, xi,

x ∈ L∞(G/H), f ∈ L1(G).

version of [7, Theorem 3.3] (see also [16, Lemma 3.11]) it follows that the unitary

Let W H ∈ L∞(H)⊗L∞(bH) be the left fundamental unitary of H. By the left
(id ⊗ γ)(W H) ∈ L∞(H)⊗L∞(bG) deﬁnes a co-action of H on G by

α : L∞(G) ∋ x 7→ (id ⊗ γ)(W H)∗(1L∞(H) ⊗ x)(id ⊗ γ)(W H) ∈ L∞(H)⊗L∞(G),

where α satisﬁes (id ⊗ α) ◦ α = (ΓH ⊗ id) ◦ α. This co-action deﬁnes a right operator
L1(H)-module structure on L∞(G) by

x ⋆H g = (g ⊗ id)α(x),

x ∈ L∞(G), g ∈ L1(H).

Moreover, the quantum homogenous space L∞(G/H) is precisely the ﬁxed point
algebra L∞(G)α = {x ∈ L∞(G) | α(x) = 1 ⊗ x} [16, Lemma 3.11]. Let αl
:
B(L2(G)) → L∞(H)⊗B(L2(G)) denote the canonical extension of α, given by

αl(T ) = (id ⊗ γ)(W H)∗(1L∞(H) ⊗ T )(id ⊗ γ)(W H),

T ∈ B(L2(G)).

We then obtain an extended right L1(H)-module action on B(L2(G)).

Theorem 3.2. Let G and H be two locally compact quantum groups such that H is
a closed quantum subgroup of G. Then G is amenable if and only if H is amenable
and G acts amenably on G/H.

Proof. If H is amenable and G acts amenably on G/H, there are states mH ∈
L∞(H)∗ and mG ∈ L∞(G/H)∗ which are invariant under the canonical L1(H) and
L1(G) actions on L∞(H) and L∞(G/H), respectively. In particular, mH satisﬁes

(mH ⊗ id)ΓH(y) = hmH, yi1,

y ∈ L∞(H).

Deﬁne the completely positive map P : L∞(G) → L∞(G) by

P (x) = (mH ⊗ id)α(x),

x ∈ L∞(G).

Then, on the one hand,

α(P (x)) = α((mH ⊗ id)α(x)) = (mH ⊗ id ⊗ id)(id ⊗ α)α(x)

= (mH ⊗ id ⊗ id)(ΓH ⊗ id)α(x) = 1 ⊗ ((mH ⊗ id)α(x))

= 1 ⊗ P (x),

Thus, P : L∞(G) → L∞(G) is a completely positive projection onto L∞(G/H).

so P (x) ∈ L∞(G/H). On the other hand, since (id ⊗ γ)(W H) ∈ L∞(H)⊗γ(L∞(bG)),
it follows that P (axb) = aP (x)b for all a, b ∈ L∞(G/H) = γ(L∞(bH))′ ∩ L∞(G).
Moreover, as V ∈ L∞(bG′)⊗L∞(G), we have (id⊗γ)(W H)12V23 = V23(id⊗γ)(W H)12,

so that

P (f ⋆G x) = (mH ⊗ id)α((id ⊗ f )V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗)

= (mH ⊗ id)(id ⊗ id ⊗ f )(α ⊗ id)(V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗)
= (mH ⊗ id)(id ⊗ id ⊗ f )((id ⊗ γ)(W H)∗
= (mH ⊗ id)(id ⊗ id ⊗ f )(V23(id ⊗ γ)(W H)∗
= (mH ⊗ id)(id ⊗ id ⊗ f )(V23(α(x) ⊗ 1)V ∗
23)
= (id ⊗ f )(V (P (x) ⊗ 1)V ∗)

23(id ⊗ γ)(W H)12)
12(x ⊗ 1)23(id ⊗ γ)(W H)12V ∗
23)

= f ⋆G P (x),

for all f ∈ L1(G) and x ∈ L∞(G). Thus, P is a left L1(G)-module map. Deﬁning
m := mG ◦ P ∈ L∞(G)∗, we obtain a right invariant mean on L∞(G), whence G is
amenable.

Conversely, suppose that G is amenable. Clearly the restriction of a right invari-
ant mean to L∞(G/H) will be L1(G)-invariant, so G acts amenably on G/H. We
show that H is amenable.

By [3, Theorem 5.2] L∞(bG) is 1-injective in L1(bG)−mod. The space B(L2(H)) =
B(L2(bH)) becomes a left operator L1(bG)-module via:

positive maps over their multiplicative domains (cf. [2]) ensures that

bH ∈ L∞(H)′⊗L∞(bH) is the right fundamental unitary of bH. Clearly, L∞(bH)
is an L1(bG)-submodule of B(L2(H)) and γ : L∞(bH) → L∞(bG) is a left L1(bG)-
module map. Thus, we may extend γ to a completely contractive left L1(bG)-module
mapeγ : B(L2(H)) → L∞(bG). Theneγ is a unital complete contraction and therefore
completely positive. Moreover, L∞(bH) is contained in the multiplicative domain
of eγ (as it extends a *-homomorphism), so the bimodule property of completely
Thus,eγ is a completely bounded L∞(bH)-γ(L∞(bH)) bimodule map between B(L2(H))
and B(L2(G)). By [11, Theorem 2.5] we can approximate eγ in the point weak*
topology by a net eγi of normal completely bounded L∞(bH)-γ(L∞(bH)) bimodule

maps. Since L∞(H) is standardly represented on L2(H), for each g ∈ L1(H) there
exist ξ, η ∈ L2(H) such that g = ωξ,η|L∞(H). Taking an orthonormal basis (ej) of
L2(H) it follows that

ˆx, ˆy ∈ L∞(bH), T ∈ B(L2(H)).

Thus, eγ is a right L1(H)-module map.
Since eγ is also a left L1(bG)-module map, for x ∈ L∞(H) and ˆf , ˆg ∈ L1(bG) we

have

hΓ bG(eγ(x)), ˆf ⊗ ˆgi = heγ(x), ˆf ⋆ bG ˆgi = hˆg (cid:3) bGeγ(x), ˆf i
= heγ(ˆg (cid:3) bG x), ˆf i = hˆg, 1iheγ(x), ˆf i
= heγ(x) ⊗ 1, ˆf ⊗ ˆgi.

The standard argument then shows that eγ(x) ∈ L∞(bG) ∩ L∞(G) = C1. Hence,
eγ|L∞(H) deﬁnes a left invariant mean on L∞(H), and H is amenable.

Remark 3.3. Theorem 3.2 yields a new proof of the classical fact that amenability
of a locally compact group passes to closed subgroups without the use of Bruhat
functions or Leptin’s theorem [18] on the equivalence of amenability of G and the
existence of a bounded approximate identity in the Fourier algebra A(G).

satisfying Γ(u) = u ⊗ u forms a locally compact group under the relative weak*
topology, called the intrinsic group of G, and is denoted Gr(G). The character

compact group, and fGs ∼= bG, the group of continuous characters on G. For more
details on the character group and properties of the assignment G 7→ eG we refer the
reader to [6, 14]. Since eG is always a closed quantum subgroup of G [6, Theorem
5.6] under the a priori stronger hypothesis that bG is co-amenable.

Hence, Φ is a right L1(bG)-module map, and it follows that L∞(bH) is relatively
1-injective in mod− L1(bG). Since L∞(bH) is a 1-injective operator space, [3, Propo-
sition 2.3] entails the 1-injectivity of L∞(bH) in mod − L1(bG).
Conversely, if L∞(bH) is 1-injective in mod − L1(bG) there exists a completely
contactive right L1(bG)-module projection E : B(L2(H)) → L∞(bH). Then E is a
right L1(bH)-module projection, which by [3, Proposition 4.7] entails the amenability

Vaes. Then there exists a completely contractive right L1(bG)-module projection
P : L∞(bG) → L∞(bH).
Proof. By Theorem 3.5, L∞(bH) is 1-injective as a right L1(bG)-module. The identity
idL∞( bH) therefore extends to a completely contractive morphism P : L∞(bG) →
L∞(bH).

Since every co-commutative quantum group is amenable, the following corollary

amenable and H is a closed amenable quantum subgroup of G in the sense of

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

is immediate.

Corollary 3.7. Let G be a locally compact group and let H be a closed amenable
subgroup of G. Then there exists a completely contractive A(G)-module projection
P : V N (G) → V N (H).

Remark 3.8. The existence of a completely bounded A(G)-module projection P :
V N (G) → V N (H) was shown in [12, Theorem 1.3] under the stronger assumption
that G is amenable.
