Abstract

A new type of the graphene-based three-port circulator is suggested and analysed. The

cross-section of the component presents a three-layer structure consisting of a layer of silicon,

of silica and of graphene. In-plane ﬁgure resembles a common microwave nanostrip circulator

with a circular graphene resonator and three waveguides symmetrically connected to it. The

graphene is magnetized normally to its plane by a DC magnetic ﬁeld. The numerical simulation

demonstrates the isolation of -15 dB and insertion losses of -2 dB in 6.98 % frequency band

with the central frequency 8.23THz.

Introduction

Circulators are important passive nonreciprocal components which are used both in microwave

and optical frequency region. These devices permit mitigate the harmful inﬂuence of reﬂections

on the sources of electromagnetic waves. In microwaves, the most popular circulators are based on

waveguide and microstrip technology with magnetized ferrite elements.1 Optical circulators have

been also discussed in literature.2,6–8

In THz region, one of the promising tendencies is graphene technology which allows one, in

particular, to construct nonreciprocal devices. Recently, an interesting idea of an edge-guided

graphene circulator was suggested in.9 The device consists of multi-layer graphene-dielectric

waveguides and this can complicate its production technology.

In this paper, we suggest a graphene circulator with a very simple structure which can be used

in THz and infrared frequency region. It consists of graphene nanostrip waveguides connected to

a graphene circular resonator.

Problem description

The schematic representation of the circulator is shown in Fig. 1a and 1b. The width of the

waveguides are w1 = 140 nm and w2 = 200, that are connected to a circular graphene resonator

with the radius 320 nm. The waveguides and the resonator are placed on a lossless dielectric

substrate of silicon and silica with the thickness h1 = 200 nm and h2 = 600 nm, with relative
permittivity e 1 = 11.9 and e 1 = 2.09, respectively.

In numerical simulations by the commercial software COMSOL,11 we have used the following

parameters of the graphene conductivity tensor:10

For numerical proposition, graphene is modeled as a bulk material with a bulk conductivity
, being [s s] the surface conductiviry tensor, which its component are

tensor given by [s v] = [s s]/D
given by (1)-(2), and D

is the thickness of the graphene. In all calculations D = 1 nm.

It is well known that graphene stips can suport two kinds of guided surface plasmon polaritons

(SPP) modes, namelly a guide mode and edge mode, which are discussed in details in.3–5 In our

case, we have chosen the former one, once the eletromagnetic ﬁeld in that mode is concentrated

in the center of the ribbon, as shown in the insert in Fig 2. The dependence of effective refractive

index for different values of frequency, with respect to width of the geraphene ribbon is shown in

Fig. 2.

In the following, the transmission coefﬁcient Si j = Pj/Pi of a signal injected in port j and

received by port i was calculated. The percentage bandwidth of circulator is deﬁned as BW =
( f2 − f1)/ f0 × 100, where f2 and f1 are the limit frequency value so that the transmission level on
a transmission port remain above - 2 dB and the isolation level on the isolation port remain below

- 15 dB at the same time. f0 is the central frequency of operation.

Numerical Result

The working principle of the circulator is similar to that of the microstrip one. The guided SPP

wave in the input waveguide excites in the circular resonator in the non-magnetic state two de-
generate clockwise w + and anticlockwise w − rotating modes. These two modes produce a dipole
aligned to the input waveguide, which leads to a transmission in both output ports, as shown in

Fig. 3a. A DC magnetic bias of B0 = 1.1 T brakes the degenerency and makes the ﬁeld pattern of

the standing wave to rotate by 60◦ aligning thus the node of dipole with the isolation of port 3 as

shown in Fig. 3b. The dependency of these two rotating dipole modes with respect to magnetic

ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 3c.

The calculated frequency characteristics are shown in Fig. 4. At a central frequency of 8.23

THz, the device presents a transmission coefﬁcient of -1.2 dB, a isolation of -33 dB, with a band-

width of 6.98 % in a transmission level of -2 dB and a isolation level of -15 dB.

Control by chemical potential of graphene

By changing chemical potential of graphene, one can change the carrier density in the ribbon,

and consequently, the values of the conductivity tensor components. This leads to a possibility of

dynamical control of the circulator responses. One can see from, Fig. 5, that the central frequency

of circulator operation shifts to higher frequencies, when the chemical potencial increases. The

opposite situation occurs by diminishing this value. Besides by changing m c, the values of the
insertion losses and the bandwidth get worst than those for m c = 0.15 eV. It can be explained by
the fact that the stationary dipole is not property aligned to the output port, but one can see that for

values between 0.12 eV and 0.20 eV, these levels are acceptable, as shown in the same ﬁgure.

Conclusions

In this work we have suggested and conﬁrmed by numerical simulations a possibility of a control-

lable three-port circulator graphene-based circulator. This component with a very simple structure

can be used in THz and infrared circuits.
