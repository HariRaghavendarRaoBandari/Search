PHOTOGRAPHIC DATASET: RANDOM PEPPERCORNS

TEEMU HELENIUS AND SAMULI SILTANEN

March 4, 2016

Abstract. This is a photographic dataset collected for testing image processing
algorithms. The idea is to have sets of diﬀerent but statistically similar images.
In this work the images show randomly distributed peppercorns. The dataset is
made available at this URL.

TEEMU HELENIUS AND SAMULI SILTANEN

1. Introduction

This document reports the acquisition, structure and properties of a digital photo-
graphic dataset collected at the Industrial Mathematics Laboratory of the Depart-
ment of Mathematics and Statistics of University of Helsinki, Finland.

The idea is to have objects with the same size scale.
The collected dataset is intended to be ideal for computational approaches based
on sparse patch-based dictionaries [1]. Similar images have already been used in
such contexts, see [2].

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Camera equipment. We use a PhaseOne XF medium-format camera equipped
with an achromatic IQ260 digital back. The lens is Phase One Digital AF 120mm
F4. The pixel size in the resulting 16bit TIFF image ﬁle is 8964×6716.
2.2. Lighting. The targets were lit with ﬁve Olight X6 Marauder LED ﬂashlights
with luminous ﬂux of 5000 lm (nominal value, 4825 lm was measured in the labora-
tory of the vendor www.valostore.ﬁ). The lights were positioned at roughly equian-
gular arrangement. The distance of each light from the target was 1,0–1,2m. The
lights were heating up quickly as they were used at maximum power. Cooling was
enhanced with three regular household fans (Merox Floor Fan FE-45A).

A diﬀuser was placed between the lights and the target to make the lighting more

uniform and to reduce sharp shadows.
See Figure 1 for the imaging setup.

2.3. Size and scale considerations. How to decide how many objects should be
visible in the image?

Here are the relevant numbers: the radius of the approximately round peppercorns
is 4–5 mm. The patch sizes we have in mind for image processing applications are
between 8×8 (used in JPEG coding) and 20×20. The full image size is 8964×6716
pixels.

The relationship between patch size and object size should be chosen wisely. Per-
haps it makes sense to have the smallest patch size (8×8) roughly equal to the
smaller object type, namely 4mm peppercorn. Then using a larger patch would
enable having several objects inside one patch. These choices lead to two pixels per
millimeter, which means that the full image target area has roughly the size 4,5
meters by 3,4 meters. This leads to an impractically large amount of peppercorns
needed to cover the image area.
However, we cannot predict all possible future uses of this open dataset. It may
become important in some study to have even several 8×8 patches ﬁtting completely
inside one peppercorn. Therefore, we choose the scale so that downsampling the
images by a factor of four leads to the image of a peppercorn to have diameter of
approximately 8 pixels. This means that we need to cover one square meter with
objects, see ﬁgure 2.
A box of size 1, 0 × 0, 7m was ﬁlled with peppercorns, whereas the photographed
area was about 0, 67 × 0, 5m, see ﬁgure 3.

3. Results

The lens–target distance was 150cm. The image sensor was roughly parallel with
the surface of the object layer. The aperture f-stop was f/11, the ISO setting 200
and the shutter speed was set to 1

In total 10 photos were taken as the dataset, see ﬁgure 4. Between taking each
photo the peppercorns were carefully re-shuﬄed by hand. Although care was taken
to avoid the bottom of the container from being visible through the peppercorns,
the possibility of such an occurrence cannot be fully excluded.
