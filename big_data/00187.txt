NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE PERMUTATION GROUPS

ROBERT M. GURALNICK, ATTILA MAR ´OTI, AND L ´ASZL ´O PYBER

Abstract. Let G be a transitive normal subgroup of a permutation group A
of ﬁnite degree n. The factor group A/G can be considered as a certain Galois
group and one would like to bound its size. One of the results of the paper
is that |A/G| < n if G is primitive unless n = 34, 54, 38, 58, or 316. This
bound is sharp when n is prime. In fact, when G is primitive, |Out(G)| < n
unless G is a member of a given inﬁnite sequence of primitive groups and n is
diﬀerent from the previously listed integers. Many other results of this ﬂavor
are established not only for permutation groups but also for linear groups and
Galois groups.

1. Introduction

1.1. Permutation groups. Aschbacher and the ﬁrst author showed [AG2] that if
A is a ﬁnite permutation group of degree n and A′ is its commutator subgroup, then
|A : A′| ≤ 3n/3, furthermore if A is primitive, then |A : A′| ≤ n. These results were
motivated by a problem in Galois theory. For another motivation for the present
paper we need a deﬁnition. Let N be a normal series for a ﬁnite group X such that
every quotient in N either involves only noncentral chief factors or is an elementary
abelian group with at least one central chief factor. Deﬁne µ(N ) to be the product
of the exponents of the quotients which involve central chief factors. Let µ(X) be
the minimum of the µ(N ) for all possible choices of N . This invariant is an upper
bound for the exponent of X/X′. In [G2] it was shown that if A is a permutation
group of degree n, then µ(A) ≤ 3n/3, furthermore if A is transitive, then µ(A) ≤ n,
and if A is primitive with A′′ 6= 1, then the exponent of A/A′ is at most 2 · n1/2.
These results were also motivated by Galois theory. In this paper we prove similar
statements and obtain corresponding results in Galois theory.

Let G be a normal subgroup of a permutation group A of ﬁnite degree n. In this
paper the factor group A/G is studied. It is often assumed that G is transitive (this
is very natural from the point of view of Galois groups and the results are much

weaker without this assumption). Throughout the paper the base of the logarithms
is 2 unless otherwise stated. Our ﬁrst result is the following.

Theorem 1.1. Let G and A be permutation groups of ﬁnite degree n with G ⊳ A.
Suppose that G is primitive. Then |A/G| < n unless G is an aﬃne primitive
permutation group and the pair (n, A/G) is (34, O−4 (2), (54, Sp4(2)), (38, O−6 (2)),
(38, SO−6 (2)), (38, O+
6 (2)), (58, Sp6(2)), (316, O−8 (2)), (316, SO−8 (2)),
(316, O+
8 (2)). Moreover if A/G is not a section of ΓL1(q) when
n = q is a prime power, then |A/G| < n1/2 log n for n ≥ 214000.

8 (2)), or (316, SO+

6 (2)), (38, SO+

The n − 1 bound in Theorem 1.1 is sharp when n is prime and G is a cyclic
group of order n. For more information about the eleven exceptions in Theorem
1.1 and for a few other examples see Section 3. Note that for every prime p there are
inﬁnitely many primes r such that the primitive permutation group G ≤ AΓL1(q)
of order np = qp = rp−1p satisﬁes |NSn(G)/G| = (n − 1)(p − 1)/p. It will also be
clear from our proofs that the bound n1/2 log n in Theorem 1.1 is asymptotically
sharp apart from a constant factor at least log9 8 and at most 1.

Our second result concerns the size of the outer automorphism group Out(G) of

a primitive subgroup G of the ﬁnite symmetric group Sn.
Theorem 1.2. Let G ≤ Sn be a primitive permutation group. Then |Out(G)| < n
unless |Out(G)| = |NSn (G)/G| ≥ n (see Theorem 1.1 for the seven exceptions) or
n = q2 with q = 2e, e > 1, and G = (C2)2e : L2(q).

Note that if G is a member of the inﬁnite sequence of exceptions in Theorem

1.2, then |Out(G)| < (n log n)/2 (see Section 12).

Next we state an asymptotic version of Theorem 1.2. For this we need a def-
inition. Let C be the class of all aﬃne primitive permutation groups G with an
almost simple point-stabilizer H with the property that the socle Soc(H) of H acts
irreducibly on the socle of G and Soc(H) is isomorphic to a ﬁnite simple classical
group such that its natural module has dimension at most 6.
Theorem 1.3. Let G ≤ Sn be a primitive permutation group. Suppose that if
n = q is a prime power then G is not a subgroup of AΓL1(q). If G is not a member
of the inﬁnite sequence of examples in Theorem 1.2, then |Out(G)| < 2 · n3/4 for
n ≥ 214000. Moreover if G is not a member of C, then |Out(G)| < n1/2 log n for
n ≥ 214000.

As mentioned earlier, the bound n1/2 log n in Theorem 1.3 is asymptotically

sharp apart from a constant factor close to 1.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 requires a careful analysis of the abelian and the
nonabelian composition factors of A/G where A and G are ﬁnite groups. For this
purpose for a ﬁnite group X we denote the product of the orders of the abelian
and the nonabelian composition factors of a composition series for X by a(X) and
b(X) respectively. Clearly |X| = a(X)b(X).

The next result deals with b(A/G) in the general case when G is transitive and

in the more special situation when G is primitive.
Theorem 1.4. Let A and G be permutation groups with G ⊳ A ≤ Sn. If G is
transitive, then b(A/G) ≤ nlog n. If G is primitive, then b(A/G) ≤ (log n)2 log log n.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

In order to give a sharp bound for a(A/G) when G is a primitive permuta-
tion group, interestingly, it is ﬁrst necessary to bound a(A) (for A primitive). In
1982 P´alfy [P´a] and Wolf [W] independently showed that |A| ≤ 24−1/3n1+c1 for
a solvable primitive permutation group A of degree n where c1 is the constant
log9(48 · 241/3) which is close to 2.24399. Equality occurs inﬁnitely often. In fact
a(A) ≤ 24−1/3n1+c1 holds [Py] for any primitive permutation group A of degree n.
Using the classiﬁcation theorem of ﬁnite simple groups we extend these results to
the following, where for a ﬁnite group X and a prime p we denote the product of
the orders of the p-solvable composition factors of X by ap(X).
Theorem 1.5. Let G ≤ Sn be primitive, let p be a prime divisor of n and let c1 be
as before. Then ap(G)|Out(G)| ≤ 24−1/3n1+c1.

Wolf [W] also showed that if G is a ﬁnite nilpotent group acting faithfully and
completely reducibly on a ﬁnite vector space V , then |G| ≤ |V |c2/2 where c2 is the
constant log9 32 close to 1.57732. In order to generalize this result we set c(X) to
be the product of the orders of the central chief factors in a chief series of a ﬁnite
group X. In particular we have c(X) = |X| for a nilpotent group X. The following
theorem extends Wolf’s result.
Theorem 1.6. Let G ≤ Sn be a primitive permutation group. Then c(G) ≤ nc2/2
where c2 is as above.

Some technical, module theoretic results enable us to show that if G ⊳ A ≤ Sn
are transitive permutation groups, then a(A/G) ≤ 6n/4 (see Theorem 7.4). In fact,
we show that a(A/G) ≤ 4n/√log n whenever n ≥ 2 (see Theorem 7.6). This together
with Theorem 1.4 give the following.
Theorem 1.7. We have |A : G| ≤ 4n/√log n·nlog n whenever G and A are transitive
permutation groups with G ⊳ A ≤ Sn and n ≥ 2.

For an exponential bound in Theorem 1.7 we can have 168(n−1)/7 (see Theorem
8.2). See [Py, Proposition 4.3] for examples of transitive p-groups (p a prime)
showing that Theorem 1.7 is essentially the best one could hope for apart from the
constant 4. It is also worth mentioning that a cn/√log n type bound fails in case we
relax the condition G ⊳ A to G ⊳⊳ A. Indeed, if A is a Sylow 2-subgroup of Sn
for n a power of 2 and G is a regular elementary abelian subgroup inside A, then
|A : G| = 2n/2n. The next result shows that an exponential bound in n holds in
general for the index of a transitive subnormal subgroup of a permutation group of
degree n.
Theorem 1.8. Let G ⊳⊳ A ≤ Sn. If G is transitive, then |A : G| ≤ 5n−1.

The proof of Theorem 1.8 avoids the use of the classiﬁcation theorem for ﬁnite
simple groups. Using the classiﬁcation it is possible to replace the 5n−1 bound with
3n−1. It would be interesting to know whether |A : G| ≤ 2n holds for transitive
permutation groups G and A with G ⊳⊳ A ≤ Sn.

We note that the paper contains sharp bounds for |A : G|, b(A/G) and a(A/G)
in case A is a primitive permutation group of degree n and G is a transitive normal
subgroup of A. These are nlog n in the ﬁrst two cases (see the proofs of Theorems
1.11 and 5.1), and it is 24−1/3nc1 in the third case (see Corollary 6.6).

1.2. Galois groups. As brieﬂy mentioned earlier the above results are also moti-
vated by questions in Galois theory. We need to introduce some deﬁnitions.

Let k ≤ F ≤ E be three ﬁelds such that k is algebraically closed in E and the
ﬁeld extension E | F is ﬁnite and separable. Let the degree of the extension E | F
be n. Let L be the Galois closure of E | F . Let k′ denote the algebraic closure of k
in L. Since L | F is a Galois extension, so are L | k′F and L | E (where k′F denotes
the compositum over k of the subﬁelds k′ and F of L). We set A = Gal(L | F ),
G = Gal(L | k′F ), and H = Gal(L | E).
By the deﬁnition of k′, the Galois group A leaves k′ invariant. Since G is the
kernel of this action, G is normal in A and A/G ∼= Gal(k′F | F ). Furthermore
A/G ∼= Gal(k′ | k) (since A/G embeds in Gal(k′ | k) which embeds in Gal(k′F | F )).
Since k′ is linearly disjoint from both E and F , viewed as extensions of k, we
have that n = |E : F| = |Ek′ : F k′|. Since G ∩ H ∼= Gal(L | k′E), the index of
G ∩ H in G is n. Thus G is transitive on the A-set A/H.

We can take E and F to be function ﬁelds of k-varieties and the extension E | F
arising from a separable map between varieties. One of the original motivations for
studying problems of this sort was the particular case when E and F are function
ﬁelds of curves over k.

We say that E | F is indecomposable if it is a minimal ﬁeld extension. This is
equivalent to saying that A acts primitively on A/H. We say that E | F is geomet-
rically indecomposable if Ek′ | F k′ is a minimal ﬁeld extension, or equivalently G
is primitive on A/H (this terminology comes from the case of considering covers of
curves).

We recall a theorem [G2] of the ﬁrst author in this setting. If E | F is inde-
composable and k is procyclic (its absolute Galois group is procyclic; eg., if k is
ﬁnite), then |k′ : k| < n. Another theorem of a similar nature had been obtained
earlier by Aschbacher and the ﬁrst author in [AG2]. If E | F is indecomposable and
K | F is an abelian extension (a Galois extension whose Galois group is abelian)
with K ⊆ L, then |K : F| ≤ n.

We now recast two of our results using the notation and assumptions made above.

Theorem 1.7 implies the following.

Theorem 1.9. |k′ : k| ≤ 4n/√log n · nlog n for n ≥ 2.

Theorem 1.1 can be stated in the following form.

Theorem 1.10. Let E | F be geometrically indecomposable. Then |k′ : k| < n
unless the pair (n, Gal(k′ | k)) is among the eleven exceptions in Theorem 1.1.
Moreover if Gal(k′ | k) is not a section of ΓL1(q) when q = n is a prime power,
then |k′ : k| < n1/2 log n for n ≥ 214000.

Finally we discuss the situation when the extension E | F is indecomposable.

Theorem 1.11. If E | F is indecomposable, then |k′ : k| < nlog n.
Proof. If |A| < n1+log n or if A is simple, the result follows. Otherwise, by [M,
Theorem 1.1], we have that A is a subgroup of Sm≀Sr containing N = (Am)r, where

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

the action of Sm is on k-element subsets of {1, . . . , m} and the wreath product has
the product action of degree n = (cid:0)m
It can be shown that N is the unique
minimal normal subgroup of A and so |A/G| ≤ |A/N| < nlog n.

It follows by [GS] that Theorems 1.9, 1.10, 1.11 are in fact equivalent to the

corresponding group theoretic theorems.

1.3. Structure of the paper. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 a
technical result (see Theorem 2.3) is proved which is an important tool in dealing
with nonabelian composition factors. Section 3 provides some examples demon-
strating the sharpness of some of our main results.
In particular, Example 3.3
sheds more light on the eleven exceptions in Theorem 1.1. In Section 4 irreducible
linear groups are considered in connection to nonabelian composition factors. Sec-
tion 5 ﬁnishes the sole treatment of nonabelian composition factors and Theorem
1.4 is proved. Section 6 initiates the study of abelian composition factors and estab-
lishes a part of Theorem 1.5. Section 7 introduces the basic tools for working with
abelian composition factors. Lemma 7.1 collects a few results on the closely related
invariant tG(V ) which, for a ﬁnite group G, is deﬁned to be the smallest number r
such that every submodule of a G-module V can be generated by r elements. This
result is used to show Theorem 1.7. Lemmas 7.7 and 7.8 are basic tools concerning
the solvable group Out(S) where S is a nonabelian ﬁnite simple group. In Section
8 subnormal subgroups are investigated and Theorem 1.8 is proved. However later
a stronger bound with a stronger hypothesis is needed (see Theorem 8.2). In Sec-
tion 9 an important structure result is given for primitive linear groups and this is
applied for groups acting on a vector space of size larger than 316. While Section
9 deals only with abelian composition factors, Section 10 considers both abelian
and nonabelian composition factors still assuming that the size of the vector space
is larger than 316.
In Section 11 the vector space has size at most 316 and this
is where the ﬁrst half of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is completed. Using properties
of the ﬁrst cohomology group, in Section 12 Theorem 1.2 is proved which may be
considered as an extension of the ﬁrst half of Theorem 1.1. Section 13 is devoted to
complete the proof of Theorem 1.5. In Section 14 Theorem 1.6 is shown. Finally,
the second half of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.3 are proved in Section 15.

2. Basic results on nonabelian composition factors

If G is a ﬁnite group, deﬁne b(G) to be the product of the orders of all the
nonabelian simple composition factors of G in a composition series for G. Two
trivial observations that we shall use without comment are:

1. if G is normal in A, then b(A) = b(A/G)b(G); and

2.

if A ≤ B, then b(A) ≤ b(B) (choose a normal series for B and intersect A
with this series – abelian quotients stay abelian and the nonabelian quotients can
only get smaller).

The ﬁrst lemma of the paper is not used in later parts of the work, nevertheless

it is worth mentioning.

Lemma 2.1. Let X1 and X2 be two ﬁnite groups, A ≤ X1 × X2, and G ✁ A. For
i = 1, 2 let πi denote the projection into Xi. (We consider πi(A) and πi(G) as
subgroups of Xi.) Then

b(A/G) ≤ b(π1(A)/π1(G))b(π2(A)/π2(G)).

Proof. Let K denote the kernel of π1 on A. Notice that if x ∈ π2(K) and y ∈ π2(G)
then [x, y] ∈ π2(G ∩ K). Hence b((π2(K) ∩ π2(G))/π2(K ∩ G)) = 1. From this we
get

b(K/(K ∩ G)) = b(π2(K)/(π2(K ∩ G))) = b(π2(K)/(π2(K) ∩ π2(G))) =

= b(π2(K)π2(G)/π2(G)) ≤ b(π2(A)/π2(G)).

Since b(A/G) = b(A/GK)b(GK/G) = b(π1(A)/π1(G))b(K/(K ∩ G)), the result
follows.

(cid:3)

The next lemma is needed for a technical result (see Theorem 2.3) for dealing

with nonabelian composition factors.
Lemma 2.2. Let J ≤ Y := X1 × ··· × Xt and assume that πi(J) = Xi for all i
(where πi is the projection onto the ith factor). Then NY (J)/J is solvable.

Proof. Set N = NY (J). Let M be the ﬁnal term in the derived series of N . Let
Bi = ker π′i ∩ J where π′i is the projection of Y onto the direct product of all but
the ith term (so Bi = J ∩ Xi).

Set R = B1 × ··· × Bt. Note that R ✁ J and that R is also normal in Y since
πi(J) = Xi for all i, whence we may pass to Y /R. If we prove the result in this
case, then M R/R ≤ J/R, and so M ≤ J. Hence we may assume from now on that
R = 1. If we prove the result in this case, then M R/R ≤ J/R, whence M ≤ J.

We induct on t. If t = 1, the result is clear.

Suppose that t = 2. Since R = 1, we may identify J as a diagonal subgroup of
X1 × X2 and the normalizer N is J(Z × Z) where Z = Z(J), whence the result.
So now assume that t > 2. By induction, we have π′i(M ) ≤ π′i(J), whence
M ≤ J(N ∩ Xi). Note that [N ∩ Xi, Xi] = [N ∩ Xi, J] ≤ Xi ∩ J = 1. Thus,
M = [M, M ] ≤ [J(N ∩ Xi), J(N ∩ Xi)] ≤ J as claimed.

(cid:3)

Note that the proof shows that the derived length of NY (J)/J is at most t − 1.
We now come to one of our major tools in studying b(A/G).

Theorem 2.3. Assume that G ⊳ A ≤ B = X ≀ St = (X1 × ··· × Xt).St = Y.St and
that G acts transitively on {X1, . . . , Xt} by conjugation. Assume that the projection
of NA(Xi) into Xi is Xi (note that NA(Xi) ≤ Xi × X′i for an obvious choice of
X′i). Let Ni = NG(Xi) and set Mi to be the projection of Ni into Xi. Let K be the
subgroup of A normalizing each Xi. Then

b(A/G) ≤ b(A/GK)b(X1/M1).

Proof. We have that b(A/G) = b(A/GK)b(GK/G). So we only need to show that
b(GK/G) ≤ b(X1/M1). Let M = M1 × ··· × Mt. Let I = J1 × ··· × Jt where Ji is
the projection of J = K ∩ G into Xi.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

7

Note ﬁrst that [K, K ∩ M ] ≤ I (since [K, Ni] ≤ [K, G] ≤ J).

In particular,
(K∩M )/(K∩I) is abelian. By Lemma 2.2, (K∩I)/J is solvable. Thus, (K∩M )/J
is solvable and in particular, b((K ∩ M )/J) = 1. Thus,

b(GK/G) = b(K/J) = b(K/(K ∩ M )) = b(KM/M ).

Put H = {y ∈ Y : [g, y] ∈ M for all g ∈ G}. Notice that KM ≤ H. From this
KM/M ≤ H/M ≤ Y /M follows. Since G permutes the t direct factors transitively,
we see that H/M (and so KM/M ) is contained in a full diagonal subgroup of
Y /M = Q(Xi/Mi). Thus, b(KM/M ) ≤ b(X1/M1) as claimed.
(cid:3)

We will use the following lemma.

Lemma 2.4. Suppose that n = mt. Then

tlog t(log m)log log m ≤ (log n)log log n.

Proof. It suﬃces to prove that (log t)2 + (log log m)2 ≤ (log log n)2. The right-hand
side is equal to (log t + log log m)2, whence the result.

(cid:3)

3. Some examples

In this section, we consider several examples with G ⊳ A ≤ Sn always with A
and G transitive. The ﬁrst example shows that |A/G| = n − 1 may hold even with
G primitive and that b(A/G) can be on the order of nlog n if we only assume that
G is transitive (note that when n = 2a for an integer a, then it is easy to see that
2 log n < |La(2)| < nlog n). The third example shows that b(A/G) can be close to
n
(log n)2 log log n even when G is primitive.

Example 3.1. Let p be a prime. Let V be a vector space over Fp of dimension a.
Let A = AGLa(p) = AGL(V ) be the full group of aﬃne transformations of V . Let
G be the normal subgroup of translations.

(1) G ⊳ A, G is transitive on V and A is primitive on V ;
(2) If a = 1, then G is primitive on V and |A/G| = p − 1;
(3) If a > 1 and (p, a) 6= (2, 2), (2, 3), then b(A/G) = |La(p)|.

Example 3.2. Let C ⊳ D be transitive groups of degree t. Let A = A5 ≀ D and
G = A5 ≀ C. Then G ⊳ A and they both act primitively on a set of cardinality
5t. Then b(A/G) = b(D/C). In particular, considering the previous example yields
examples of primitive A and G with b(A/G) > t

2 log t > ( 1

2 log log n)−2.

For the third example and for later use the full symplectic group of dimension
2a (a and integer) over the prime ﬁeld of order p is denoted by Sp2a(p). Its order
is pa2
i=1(p2i − 1). The group Sp2a(p) has a center of size (2, p − 1), the greatest
common divisor of 2 and p − 1, and the corresponding factor group is denoted by
PSp2a(p). We will also need the orthogonal groups in this paper however only for
the ﬁeld of size 2 (apart from Lemma 7.7). We denote the full orthogonal groups
of dimension 2a (a and integer) over the ﬁeld of order 2 by Oǫ
2a(2) where ǫ = ±1.
Their order is 2· 2a(a−1)(2a − ǫ) Qa−1
i=1 (22i − 1). The groups Oǫ
2a(2) have a subgroup
of index 2 which we denote by SOǫ
2a(2).

Example 3.3. Let p be a prime. Let R be a p-group of symplectic type – i.e.
Z(R) is cyclic of order p or 4, R/Z(R) is elementary abelian of order p2a for an
integer a and R has exponent p for p odd and exponent 4 for p = 2. Let q be a
prime power such that q − 1 is a multiple of p and a multiple of 4 if |Z(R)| = 4.
Then R embeds in the group GLpa (q) = GL(V ). Let N be the normalizer of R in
GL(V ) and Z the group of scalars. Then N/RZ ∼= Sp2a(p) or N/RZ ∼= Oǫ
2a(2)
with the latter possibility occurring when p = 2 and Z(R) is cyclic of order 2. In
particular (except for some very small cases), b(N/R) = |PSp2a(p)| or |SOǫ
2a(2)|.
Let G = V R and A = V N . Then A and G are primitive permutation groups on V
and b(A/G) = |PSp2a(p)| or |SOǫ
2a(2)|. In particular, when q = 3, p = 2 we obtain
examples where b(A/G) has size approximately (log n)2 log log n.

4. Normalizers of irreducible linear groups – Nonabelian

composition factors

In this section, we consider G ⊳ A ≤ GL(V ) = GLd(q) where V is a vector space
of dimension d over the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order q and want to bound b(A/G) when G is
irreducible on V . Of course, this is a special case of the problem for general pairs
of primitive groups – this is equivalent to the setup for the case of groups acting
primitively on an aﬃne space.

Recall that a subgroup A of GL(V ) is called primitive if it preserves no additive
decomposition of V (i.e. there is no A-invariant collection of subspaces V1, . . . , Vt
with V = ⊕iVi). In particular, this implies that A is irreducible and every normal
subgroup of A acts homogeneously on V (i.e. any two simple submodules are
isomorphic). Recall also the deﬁnition of a p-group of symplectic type (see Example
3.3).
Theorem 4.1. Let G ⊳ A ≤ GL(V ) = GLd(q). Set n = qd ≥ 3. Assume that
G acts irreducibly on V and that A acts primitively on V . Assume that every
irreducible J-submodule of V is absolutely irreducible for any normal subgroup J of
G. Then b(A/G) < (log n)2 log log n.

Proof. As we have already noted, every normal subgroup of A acts homogeneously
on V . In particular, any abelian normal subgroup acts homogeneously and so is
cyclic by Schur’s Lemma. By hypothesis, it must be central. There is no harm in
assuming that G contains all solvable normal subgroups of A (since that does not
aﬀect b(A/G)).

Let R be any normal subgroup of A that is minimal with respect to being non-

central. We see that R is nonabelian.

So Z(R) ≤ Z(A) consists of scalars and R/Z(R) is characteristically simple. So
either R is a central product of say t quasisimple groups Qi (with Qi/Z(Qi) all
isomorphic) or R/Z(R) is an elementary abelian r-group for some prime r. In the
second case it follows easily that R is of symplectic type with |R/Z(R)| = r2a for
some a. Since G contains every solvable normal subgroup of A, G contains R in
the latter case.

Let R be a non-solvable normal subgroup of A which is minimal with respect to
being non-central. So R is perfect. Since G acts irreducibly, CA(G) = Z(A). In

particular, R cannot centralize G. Suppose that R is not contained in G. Then
G ∩ R ≤ Z(A). It follows by the three subgroup lemma that R = [R, R] centralizes
G, a contradiction.

Let J1, . . . , Jk denote the distinct normal subgroups of A that are minimal with
respect to being noncentral in A. Let J = J1 ··· Jk be the central product of these
subgroups. We have shown that J ≤ G. Then CA(J) = Z(A) (for otherwise the
normal subgroup CA(J) of A would contain a normal subgroup, say J1 of A which
is minimal with respect to being non-central, then J1 ≤ Z(J) which implies that
J1 is abelian).

Thus, A/Z(A)J embeds into the direct product of the outer automorphism
groups of the normal subgroups of A which are minimal subject to being non-
central. If R is such a normal subgroup and is perfect with t components, then
either t < 5 and this outer automorphism group is solvable or t ≥ 5 and modulo its
solvable radical is St.

If R is of symplectic type with |R/Z(R)| = r2a, then this outer automorphism

group has at most one non-solvable composition factor – PSp2a(r) or SOǫ

2a(2).

This gives us our upper bound on b(A/J) and so also on b(A/G). Let W be
an irreducible constitutent for J. Since A is primitive on V , it follows that J acts
homogeneously on V . It follows by [KL, Lemma 5.5.5, page 205 and Lemma 2.10.1,
pages 47-48] that W ∼= U1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Uk where Ui is an irreducible Ji-module.
In
particular, if Ji is the central product of t copies of a nonabelian simple group,
then dim Ui ≥ 2t and if Ji is of symplectic type with Ji/Z(Ji) of order r2a, then
dim Ui = ra. Moreover, since Ui is absolutely irreducible, r|(q − 1).

A straightforward computation shows that Qi b(Out(Ji)) < (log n)2 log log n and
(cid:3)

this ﬁnishes the proof.
Theorem 4.2. Let G ⊳ A ≤ GL(V ) = GLd(q). Set n = qd ≥ 3. Assume that G
acts irreducibly on V . Then b(A/G) < (log n)2 log log n.

Proof. Consider a counterexample with d minimal. We claim that G acts absolutely
irreducibly on V . If not, let E = EndG(V ) and let C be the group of units in the
ﬁeld E. So |E| = qe > q.

There is no harm in replacing G by GC and A by AC and so assume C ≤ G. Let
A0 = CA(C). Then A/A0 is abelian (since it embeds in the automorphism group
of C) and so b(A/G) = b(A0/G). Also, viewing V as a vector space over E, G (and
so A0) certainly act irreducibly. Since dimE(V ) < d we obtain a contradiction.

So we assume that G (and so A) acts absolutely irreducibly on V .

Suppose that A preserves a ﬁeld extension structure on V over Fqe with e > 1.
Let A0 = A ∩ GLd/e(qe) and G0 = G ∩ A0. Let U denote V considered as a vector
space over Fqe (and as an Fqe [A0]-module). Then A embeds in GLd/e(qe).e. Let
W = V ⊗Fq

Fqe . Now

W ∼= ⊕σ∈Gal(F

qe|Fq)U σ

as an A0-module. Then A permutes the U σ. Moreover, G0 acts irreducibly on U (or
G acts reducibly on W , a contradiction to the fact that V is absolutely irreducible as
a G-module). Also, A0 acts faithfully on U (x trivial on U implies that x is trivial on

10

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

U σ for all σ, whence x is trivial on W ). Then b(A/G) = b(A0/G0) < (log n)2 log log n
contradicts the minimality of d (noting that n = |U|).

Suppose that A acts imprimitively on V – so V = V1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Vt with t > 1
and A permutes the Vi. Note that G must permute the Vi transitively as well
since G is irreducible. Let K be the subgroup of A ﬁxing each Vi. Let Ai be
the action of NA(Vi) on Vi and deﬁne Gi in an analogous way. By Theorem 2.3,
we have b(A/G) ≤ b(A/GK)b(A1/G1). By Theorem 5.1 (see the next section),
b(A/GK) < tlog t. Now G1 must act irreducibly on V1 (otherwise K ∩ G and so
G would act reducibly on V ) and so by minimality, b(A1/G1) < (log m)2 log log m,
where m = |V1|. Note that n = mt. So

b(A/G) < tlog t(log m)2 log log m.

The desired conclusion follows from Lemma 2.4.

The remaining case is that G is absolutely irreducibly on V , A is primitive on V
and preserves no ﬁeld extension structure on V . Let J be a normal subgroup of A.
Then J must act homogeneously on V (by the primitivity hypothesis) and moreover,
the irreducible constituents for J must be absolutely irreducible (otherwise the
center of EndJ (V ) is Fqe for some e > 1 and would be normalized by A, whence
A preserves a ﬁeld extension structure on V ). Now the result follows by Theorem
4.1.
(cid:3)

5. Normalizers of transitive and primitive groups – Nonabelian

composition factors

We consider the situation G ⊳ A ≤ Sn. We wish to bound b(A/G) when G
is transitive and when G is primitive.
It is easy to see that even if one is only
interested in the primitive case, one needs an answer in the transitive case as well.

We ﬁrst consider the case when G is merely transitive. We have already used

this result in the previous section.
Theorem 5.1. Let G and A be nontrivial transitive groups with G ⊳ A ≤ Sn.
Then b(A/G) < nlog n.

Proof. Suppose the theorem is false and consider a counterexample with n minimal.
First suppose that A is primitive.

Let E := F ∗(A) be the generalized Fitting subgroup of A. By the Aschbacher-
O’Nan-Scott theorem, either E is a minimal normal subgroup or E = E1 × E2 with
E1 ∼= E2 a direct product of t copies of a simple nonabelian subgroup L of order
m.

In the other cases, G contains E and so we may assume that G = E.

In the latter case, n = mt, G must contain one of the Ei and by the structure
theorem together with Schreier’s conjecture, we see that b(A/G) ≤ n(t!)/2 < nlog n.
If E
is abelian, then A/G embeds in GLa(p) with n = pa for an integer a and so
b(A/G) ≤ |La(p)| < nlog n. If E is nonabelian and is the product of t copies of a
nonabelian simple group L, then either t ≤ 4 and A/G is solvable or n ≥ 5t and
b(A/G) ≤ (t!)/2 < nlog n.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

Suppose that A is not primitive. Let {B1, . . . , Bt} be an A-invariant partition of
the underlying set on which A acts. Let Ai denote the action of the stabilizer of Bi
in A on Bi. Then A embeds in Ai≀St and G permutes transitively the subgroups Ai.
Let Gi denote the action of the stabilizer of Bi in G on Bi. We apply Theorem 2.3
and induction to conclude that b(A/G) ≤ tlog tb(A1/G1) ≤ tlog tslog s where n = st.
Thus, the result holds.

(cid:3)

The previous and the next theorem imply Theorem 1.4.

Theorem 5.2. Let G and A be primitive groups with G ⊳ A ≤ Sn and n ≥ 3.
Then b(A/G) < (log n)2 log log n.

Proof. We consider the various cases in the Aschbacher-O’Nan-Scott theorem.

In all cases, G contains E := F ∗(A). The result follows by Theorem 4.2 if E is
abelian. So we may assume that E is a direct product of t copies of a nonabelian
simple group L of order m. Let K denote the subgroup of A stabilizing all the
components of a minimal normal subgroup of A. Clearly K contains E.

Suppose ﬁrst that E = E1×E2 with E1 ∼= E2 the two minimal normal subgroups
of A. In this case t = 2s and n = |E1| = ms. Then GK/K ⊳ A/K are transitive
subgroups of Ss and so by Theorem 5.1, b(A/GK) ≤ slog s. On the other hand,
K/E is solvable (because it is contained in the direct product of copies of the outer
automorphism group of L). Thus, b(A/G) = b(A/GK) ≤ slog s < (log n)log log n.

In the remaining cases, E is the unique minimal normal subgroup of A, the groups
GK/K ⊳ A/K are transitive subgroups of St and so, as in the previous case, we
see that b(A/G) ≤ tlog t. It follows by the Aschbacher-O’Nan-Scott theorem that
n ≥ 5t and so tlog t < (log n)log log n.

(cid:3)

6. p-solvable composition factors of primitive groups

If G is a ﬁnite group, deﬁne a(G) to be the product of the orders of all the
abelian (i.e. cyclic) simple composition factors of G in a composition series for G.
The bounds we will give in this section for a(G) extend naturally to results about
ap(G) deﬁned to be the product of the orders of all composition factors of G which
are either p-groups or p′-groups for a given prime p. Clearly a(G) ≤ ap(G) for any
prime p and, by the Odd Order Theorem, a2(G) = a(G).

It is easy to see that ap(G) (and a(G)) is bounded by the order of some p-
solvable (solvable) subgroup S ≤ G (e.g., this follows from Theorem 6.4 below). By
a theorem of Dixon [D] this implies (see also Dixon-Mortimer [DM]) that a(G) is
at most 24(n−1)/3 for any subgroup G of Sn. We state the following more general
result.
Proposition 6.1. Let G ≤ Sn. The product of the orders of all composition factors
of G which are not isomorphic to alternating groups of degrees larger than d ≤ 4
is at most d!(n−1)/(d−1). In particular, a2(G) and a3(G) are at most 24(n−1)/3 and
ap(G) ≤ (p − 1)!(n−1)/(p−2) for p ≥ 5.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows from [M, Corollary 1.5] by using the argument
implicit in the proofs of Theorem 14.2 and Lemma 14.1.
(cid:3)

Recall that a subgroup I is intravariant in a group G if for all automorphisms

α of G, the subgroup I α is G-conjugate to I.
Lemma 6.2. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let G = G0 ⊲ G1 ⊲ ··· ⊲ Gr = 1 be
a normal series with each Gi ⊳ G. Let Gi = Gi−1/Gi. Let p be a ﬁxed prime.
Suppose for each i that Ii is an intravariant p′-subgroup of Gi. Then G has a
p′-subgroup H such that |H| ≥ Qr
Proof. This is a special case of [Su, Theorem 5.3.17].

i=1 |Ii|.

(cid:3)

We also need a consequence [LP, Lemma 2.9] of the classiﬁcation theorem of

ﬁnite simple groups.

Lemma 6.3. Let G be a nonabelian ﬁnite simple group and p a prime. Then G
has a solvable intravariant p′-subgroup I such that 2|Out(G)|p ≤ |I|.

Now we prove a useful reduction result.

Theorem 6.4. Let G be a ﬁnite group and p a prime. Then ap(G) ≤ |S| for some
p-solvable subgroup S of G.

Proof. We may assume that the largest normal p-solvable subgroup of G is trivial.
The socle L of G is a direct product L = L1 × ··· × Lt of nonabelian simple
groups Li and G is embedded in Aut(L). Denote the kernel of the action of G on
the set of subgroups Li by K. Then G/K is a permutation group of degree t and
|G/K|p ≤ 2t.

Let I1, . . . , It be solvable intravariant p′-subgroups of maximal orders in the
i=1 Out(Li), using

groups L1, . . . , Lt. Since K/L is isomorphic to a subgroup of Qt
Lemma 6.3 we see that |I1||I2|···|It| ≥ 2t |K/L|p ≥ |G/L|p.

It is easy to see that the subgroup I = I1I2 ··· It is intravariant in L.
Consider now a normal series G = G0 ⊲ G1 ⊲ ··· ⊲ Gr−1 = L such that the
groups Gi/L form a chief series of G/L. Every p′-factor Gj /Gj+1 can be considered
as an intravariant p′-subgroup of itself. Applying Lemma 6.2 we see that G has a
p′-subgroup S whose order is greater or equal to the product of the orders of these
p′-factors and |G/L|p. Therefore we have |S| ≥ ap(G) as required.
(cid:3)

Combining Theorem 6.4 with well-known results of P´alfy [P´a] and Wolf [W] one
obtains sharp bounds for a(X) for irreducible linear groups and primitive permuta-
tion groups X. Using [HM] we extend these results even further. In the next three
results c1 = log9(48 · 241/3) which is close to 2.24399.
Theorem 6.5. If A is a ﬁnite group acting faithfully and completely reducibly on
a ﬁnite vector space of size n in characteristic p, then a(A) ≤ ap(A) ≤ 24−1/3nc1.
Proof. By Theorem 6.4 we know that there is a p-solvable subgroup S of A such
that ap(A) ≤ |S|. Moreover, by the construction implicit in the proof of Theorem
6.4, we may assume that Op(S) = 1 (since Op(A) = 1). Thus S can be viewed as a
ﬁnite group acting faithfully and completely reducibly on a vector space of size n.
By [HM, Theorem 1.2] we have |S| ≤ 24−1/3nc1.
(cid:3)

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

Corollary 6.6. Let 1 6= G ⊳ A ≤ Sn with A primitive. Let p be a prime dividing
n. Then a(A/G) ≤ ap(A/G) ≤ 24−1/3nc1.

Proof. We use the Aschbacher-O’Nan-Scott Theorem. The aﬃne case follows from
Theorem 6.5 by noting that |G| may be taken to be n. So assume that F ∗(A) is
nonabelian and it is the direct product of t copies of a nonabelian simple group L.
By our choice of p the group L (and thus F ∗(A)) is not p-solvable.

If F ∗(A) is the unique minimal normal subgroup of A, then n ≥ mt for some
divisor m of |L| which is at least the minimal degree of a permutation representation
for L. In this case ap(A) ≤ |Out(L)|tap(T ) where T is a transitive permutation
group on t letters. By [AG2, Lemma 2.7 (i)] we have |Out(L)| ≤ (2/3)m, and by
Proposition 6.1 we have ap(T ) ≤ n (since m can be chosen such that m ≥ p). These
give ap(A) < (2/3)n2. This is less than 24−1/3nc1 unless n ≤ 15 (and thus t = 1).
If n ≤ 15, then ap(A) is at most |Out(L)| < m = n < 24−1/3nc1.

Finally assume that F ∗(A) is the direct product of two minimal normal sub-
groups of A. In this case n = lt/2 where l = |L| ≥ 60. Again by [AG2, Lemma
2.7 (i)] and Proposition 6.1 we ﬁnd that ap(A) ≤ (2/3)n2 < 24−1/3nc1 for n ≥ 60
(since l1/2 ≥ p).

(cid:3)

This immediately implies the following sharp result (which extends the main

result of [P´a] and [W]).

Corollary 6.7. If A is a primitive permutation group of degree n and p is a prime
divisor of n, then a(A) ≤ ap(A) ≤ 24−1/3n1+c1.

This proves a part of Theorem 1.5.

7. Basic results on abelian composition factors

Our earlier results on nonabelian composition factors in wreath products do
not help in considering abelian composition factors. We use diﬀerent methods for
studying abelian composition factors.

The following lemma and its consequences will be crucial in proving Theorem

1.1 on the indices of primitive groups in their normalizers.

If V is a G-module over a ﬁeld, let tG(V ) denote the smallest number r such

that every submodule of V can be generated by r elements.

Lemma 7.1. Let H < G with |G : H| = t > 1. Let W be an H-module over an
arbitrary ﬁeld and let V = W G
H be the induced module. Then we have the following.

2 dim V .

1) tG(V ) ≤ 1
2) If t 6= 2n for any integer n, then tG(V ) ≤ 1
3) If H ⊳ G and G/H ∼= Cn
4) If t = 2n for an integer n, then tG(V ) ≤ 3

and G/H ∼= C2 or C2

2 . Moreover tG(V ) ≤ 5

3 dim V .

2 , then tG(V ) ≤ cn dim V where cn = 1

16 dim V for t ≥ 32.

14

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

Proof. First we prove 1) and 2). By extension of scalars, we may assume that the
ground ﬁeld k is algebraically closed. Let p be the largest prime dividing t and let
S be a Sylow p-subgroup of G.

Consider the restricted module VS. By the Mackey decomposition, this is a
direct sum of induced modules of the form (W g)S
Hg∩S with g ∈ G. Now p divides
t, so H g ∩ S is a proper subgroup of S for all g ∈ G. If we manage to show the
proposed bounds for tS(VS) then we are ﬁnished since tG(V ) ≤ tS(VS). Since tS is
subadditive with respective to a direct sum decomposition of VS, it is suﬃcient to
bound tS((W g)S
Hg∩S) for a given g ∈ G. But this means that we may assume that
S = G and H g = H.

Now let c ∈ G be an element which does not lie in any conjugate of H and let
C = hci. Then, as above, C ∩ H g is proper in C for all g ∈ G, so by restricting V
to C we may assume that G is a nontrivial cyclic p-group.

We can also assume that W is irreducible. Since H is cyclic, W is 1-dimensional
and the induced module V consists of a single Jordan block, thus it can be generated
by one element. That is, tG(V ) = 1 ≤ 1

2 dim V as required.

p dim V ≤ 1

Now if t 6= 2n, then p > 2 and 2) follows.
Now we turn to the proof of 3) and 4). If t = 2n, then let P be the permutation
representation of G on the set of left cosets of H and let T be a Sylow 2-subgroup
of G, the image of S in the permutation representation P . Then T is transitive and
so the restricted module VS is simply the induced module W S
S∩H , by the Mackey
decomposition.

Instead of V and W , we will consider the restricted modules VS and WS∩H . If
char(k) 6= 2, then VS is semisimple and tG(V ) ≤ tS(V ) ≤ dim W holds. So we can
assume that char(k) = 2. Then we can assume that WS∩H is irreducible, so the
action of S ∩ H on WS∩H is trivial, i.e., WS∩H is the trivial 1-dimensional module.
(For this notice that a composition series of WS∩H corresponds naturally to a series
of dim W submodules of V . For any submodule A of V we can view the intersection
of A with the members of the previous series. We obtain the claim after summing
dimensions corresponding to factor modules of A and by noticing that cn can be
viewed as a constant.) Then VS is isomorphic to the regular representation module
of Cn

2 . Now using [KN, 3.2] we see that tG(V ) ≤ tS(V ) ≤ cn dim V , as required.
In proving 4), we need the following.

Claim. Let D be the permutational wreath product of a regular elementary
If g is an element of order 4 in D, then the cycle

abelian 2-group R and C2.
decomposition of g consists of 4-cycles.

To see this, write g in the form g = (a, b)τ where (a, b) is an element of the
base group R1 × R2 (here R1 and R2 are naturally identiﬁed with R) and τ is the
involution in the top group. Then g2 = (a, b)τ (a, b)τ = (ab, ba). Since g2 6= 1, we
see that ab and ba = (ab)−1 are both diﬀerent from the identity, hence they are
ﬁxed point free involutions and so is g2 which implies the claim.

Now we will prove 4).

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

15

If T itself is not isomorphic to the regular action of Cn

2 , then we prove that
tS(V ) ≤ 1
4 dim V from which 4) follows. We argue by induction. Let B1, B2 be a
T -invariant partition. Let K be the stabiliser of the partition. Since K has index
2 in T , K acts as a transitive group Ki on Bi so using the inductive hypothesis,
we are done unless K1 (or equivalently, K2) is isomorphic to the regular action of
Cn−1
. Then T embeds into the wreath product K1 ≀ C2. Now T has an element
g of order 4, otherwise T would be regular elementary abelian. By our claim, the
cycle decomposition of g consists of 4-cycles. Now using the preimage of g in G we
see that tG(V ) ≤ 1

2

4 dim V .
If T is isomorphic to Cn

2 then our claim follows from 3).

(cid:3)

Lemma 7.1 is used in the following result.

Lemma 7.2. Let X1, . . . , Xt be ﬁnite groups, X their direct product, and let G be
an automorphism group of X which permutes the factors transitively. Let K ≤ X
be a G-invariant subgroup, such that for each projection πi of X onto Xi we have
πi(K) ⊳⊳ Xi. Set J = [G, K] (and note that J is normal in K and G-invariant).
Then a(K/J) ≤ (a(X1))t/2. If t 6= 2, 4 then a(K/J) ≤ (a(X1))3t/8 and if t ≥ 17
then a(K/J) ≤ (a(X1))t/3.

Proof. Let Y1 be a minimal characteristic subgroup of X1 and let Y = Y1 × . . .× Yt
where Yi are the images of Y1 under G. Note that

a(K/J) = a(K/J(K ∩ Y ))a((K ∩ Y )J/J) = a(KY /JY )a((K ∩ Y )/(J ∩ Y )).

So by induction on the length of a characteristic series in X1, we might assume that
Xi is characteristically simple.

If Xi is elementary abelian, then X is an induced module and the result follows
by Lemma 7.1. Suppose that Xi is a direct product of isomorphic copies of a
nonabelian simple group. Since πi(K) ⊳⊳ Xi, the same is true for each πi(K),
whence K is also a direct product of copies of a nonabelian simple group. Since
J ⊳ K, K/J also has the same form, whence a(K/J) = 1.

If t 6= 2, 4 or t ≥ 17, the same argument applies (using the stronger conclusions

(cid:3)

in Lemma 7.1).

We will use Lemma 7.2 in the above form, however in one case we will need a

reﬁned version.

Lemma 7.3. Use the notations and assumptions of Lemma 7.2. Let t = 4 and for
each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ t suppose that Xi = GL2(3). Then a(K/J) ≤ 162 · 3.
Proof. In the notation of Lemma 7.1 we have tG(V ) ≤ 1
tG(V ) ≤ 1
Lemma 7.2 gives a(K/J) ≤ 16t/2 · 3t/4 = 162 · 3.

2 dim V in general, and
4 dim V for t = 4 and char(k) = 3. Since |GL2(3)| = 16 · 3, the proof of

(cid:3)

We will need the following explicit exponential estimate.

Theorem 7.4. Let G ⊳ A ≤ Sn with G transitive. Then a(A/G) ≤ 6n/4.

16

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

Proof. If A is primitive, then our statement follows from Corollary 6.6 for n ≥ 12
and from [GAP] for n ≤ 11.

If A is not primitive, then choose a non-trivial partition {B1, . . . , Bt} that is
A-invariant with 1 < t < n maximal. Denote by A1 the action of the stabilizer of
B1 in A on B1 and denote by K the stabilizer of the partition in A. Write n = st.
Then

a(A/G) ≤ a(A/KG)a(K/G ∩ K) ≤ a(A/KG)a(K/ [G, K]).
First suppose that t is diﬀerent from 2 and 4. Then induction and Lemma 7.2 yield
a(A/G) ≤ 6t/4 · a(A1)3t/8. By Proposition 6.1, a(A1) ≤ 24(s−1)/3 and so
a(A/G) ≤ 6t/4 · 24(s−1)t/8 < 6t/4 · 6(s−1)t/4 = 6st/4 = 6n/4.

Now let t = 2 or t = 4. Then by [M, Corollary 1.4] we see that a(A1) ≤ 6(s−1)/2,
unless s = 4. This and the previous argument using Lemma 7.2 give the desired
conclusion unless the set of prime divisors of |A| is {2, 3} and n = 8 or n = 16. But
even in this case [GAP] gives the result.

(cid:3)

An asymptotically better version of Lemma 7.1 has been obtained by Lucchini,
Menegazzo and Morigi [LMM1]. The constant in their result has been evaluated
by Tracey [T, Corollary 4.2].
Lemma 7.5. Let H < G with |G : H| = t > 1. Let W be an H-module and let
V = W G

H be the induced module. Then tG(V ) < 4

t√log t dim W .

Combining this lemma with other ideas above one can easily prove the following.

Theorem 7.6. Let G and A be transitive permutation groups of degree n > 1 with

G ⊳ A. Then a(A/G) ≤ 4n/√log n.

Proof. We use the bound, the notation and the argument of Theorem 7.4. By the
6n/4 bound we see that we may assume that n > 512. Also, by Corollary 6.6, it is
easy to see that we may assume that A is an imprimitive transitive group. Let t
and s be as in the proof of Theorem 7.4. By use of Lemma 7.2 and Corollary 6.7,
the result follows for s ≥ 32 as in the proof of Theorem 7.4. If 6 ≤ s < 32, then we
obtain the result using the fact that t > 16. Finally, if 2 ≤ s ≤ 5, then t > 100 and
the bound follows.

(cid:3)

As pointed out in the Introduction, Theorems 7.6 and 5.1 imply Theorem 1.7.

We will also use various bounds for the orders of outer automorphism groups of

simple groups.

Lemma 7.7. Let S be a nonabelian ﬁnite simple group and suppose that S has
a nontrivial permutation representation of degree n. Then |Out(S)| ≤ 2 log n or
S = Ld(q) with d > 2 or S = PΩ+
8 (3e) with e an integer, and |Out(S)| ≤ 3 log n.
In all cases we have |Out(S)| ≤ 2√n. Moreover, |Out(S)| ≤ √n unless S = A6,

L2(27), L3(4) or L3(16).

Proof. We refer the reader to Chapter 5 of [KL] for detailed information about
these degrees of permutation representations and outer automorphism groups.

In most cases we will see in fact that |Out(S)| ≤ log n ≤ √n holds.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

17

If S is sporadic, the Tits group, or an alternating group of degree other than 6,

then |Out(S)| ≤ 2 and n > 4. Also, |Out(A6)| = 4 ≤ 2 log 6.

So assume that S is a simple group of Lie type in characteristic p and is not an

alternating group.

Suppose that S = L2(q) for some power q of p. So q > 5 and q 6= 9. The smallest
permutation representation is at least q and is generically q + 1. Also, the outer
automorphism group has size (2, q−1) logp q which is less than log n if p = 2 or p ≥ 5
and is at most 2 log n if p = 3. If p = 3 and q > 9 then |Out(S)| = 2 log3 q ≤ √q + 1
unless q = 27.

Next consider the case that S = Ld(q), d > 2. We may exclude L3(2) = L2(7)
and L4(2) = A8. The order of the outer automorphism group is 2(d, q − 1) logp q
and the smallest permutation representation is of degree (qd − 1)/(q − 1).

So log((qd − 1)/(q − 1)) > (d − 1) log q ≥ 2(d, q − 1) logp q unless one of the

following holds.

1. d|(q − 1) and (d − 1)/2d ≤ logp q/ log q = logp 2. In this case p ≤ 7. If p = 7,

then d = 3, and if p = 5, then d ≤ 7. We have

|Out(S)| = logp(q2d) < log(n2d/(d−1)) = 2d log n/(d − 1) ≤ 3 log n.

Also, note that if d|(q − 1), then logp(q2d) < ((qd − 1)/(q − 1))1/2 unless d = 3 and
q = 4 or q = 16.

2. (d, q − 1) = d/2 and (d − 1)/d ≤ logp 2. In this case p = 2. Also d/2 must be
odd, whence d ≥ 6. Thus |Out(S)| = log(qd) ≤ (1 + 2/d) log n ≤ (4/3) log n. Note
also that (4/3) log n < √n since d ≥ 6 and q ≥ 4.
Next consider Ud(q) with d ≥ 3. We exclude U3(2) (which is solvable).
Then the outer automorphism group has order 2(d, q + 1) logp q.
If d = 3, then the smallest permutation degree is q3 + 1 (aside from q = 5, where
it is 50). If p > 3, we see that log n dominates |Out(S)| unless q = 5. If p = 3, then
|Out(S)| = 2 log3 q and the result holds.

Finally, if p = 2 and q > 2 is an odd power of 2, then |Out(S)| = 6 log q and

n > q3, whence |Out(S)| < 2 log n.

If d = 4, then the smallest permutation degree is (q + 1)(q3 + 1). We see that
|Out(S)| = 2(4, q + 1) logp q which is less than log n unless p = 3 when it is at most
2 log n.

If d ≥ 5, then the smallest permutation representation has degree roughly q2d−3
and we see that |Out(S)| ≤ log n if p ≥ 5 and at most 2 log n in any case. In all
cases we have |Out(S)| ≤ √n.

Suppose that S = PΩ+

In this case |Out(S)| = 24 logp q and the
smallest permutation degree is (q4 + 1)(q2 + q + 1).
If p ≥ 5, then we see that
|Out(S)| ≤ 2 log n. If p = 3, then |Out(S)| ≤ 3 log n and in any case |Out(S)| is at
most √n.

8 (q), q odd.

In all other cases, |Out(S)| ≤ 8 log q and we see that |Out(S)| < log n. This

(cid:3)

completes the proof.

We remark that the above lemma may be considered as a sharper version of the

observation [AG2] that if S 6= A6, then 2|Out(S)| < n.

A handy consequence of the lemma is that for all nonabelian ﬁnite simple groups
S we have |Out(S)| ≤ 4p|S| unless S = L3(4). This follows from the known fact
that the minimal degree of a permutation representation of S is less than p|S|,
when |Out(S)| ≤ √n, and directly in the remaining cases.

We end this section with a result about dimensions versus outer automorphism

groups for simple groups.

Lemma 7.8. Let S be a nonabelian simple section of SLn(p) where p is a prime.
Then |Out(S)| ≤ 4n.
Proof. For sporadic and alternating groups the result is obvious.

Suppose that S is a group in Lie(p′) over Fr of (untwisted) rank ℓ. By [LP,
Lemma 3.1] in this case we have n ≥ min{Rp(S), rℓ} where Rp(S) is the minimal
degree of a projective representation of S in characteristic p. Using the lower
bounds of Landazuri and Seitz for Rp(S) (slightly corrected in [KL, Table 5.3A])
and [KL, Table 5.1A], where values of |Out(S)| are given, the result follows by easy
inspection.

Suppose now that S is a group in Lie(p).

If the order of S is divisible by a
primitive prime divisor of pm − 1 then clearly n ≥ m holds. A list of the largest
such numbers m is given in [KL, Table 5.2C]. Using this we see that in all cases
4m ≥ |Out(S)| holds. This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

8. Transitive subnormal subgroups

In this section we prove an amusing variant of Theorem 1.7 for subnormal tran-

sitive subgroups by an elementary argument. This is Theorem 1.8.
Theorem 8.1. Let G ⊳⊳ A ≤ Sn. If G is transitive, then |A : G| ≤ 5n−1.
Proof. Consider a counterexample with n minimal.

Let {B1, . . . , Bt} be an A-invariant partition, which consists of blocks of minimal
size k > 1 (if A is primitive, then we take k = n). Denote by Hi the action of the
stabilizer of Bi in A on Bi. Denote by K the kernel of the action of A on the set
of blocks and by Ki the action of K on Bi.

We claim that |K : G ∩ K| ≤ 5n−t.
By the minimality of k the group H1 is primitive.

By a theorem of Praeger and Saxl [PS] if H1 does not contain the alternating
group Ak, then |H1| ≤ 4k. It follows that in this case |H1| ≤ 5k−1 holds (since for
k ≥ 8 we have 4k < 5k−1 and for k ≤ 7 we have |Sk| ≤ 5k−1).

Hence in this case in fact we have |K| ≤ |H1|t ≤ 5n−t.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

19

Otherwise k ≥ 8 and Ak ≤ H1 and since K1 ⊳ H1, we have K1 = 1, Ak or Sk.
If K1 = 1 then K = 1.

Otherwise K is a subdirect product of symmetric or alternating groups of degree
k. Hence the derived subgroup K′ is a subdirect product of alternating groups of
degree k and we have |K : K′| ≤ 2t. Now Ak is nonabelian and simple, so the set
{B1, . . . , Bt} has a partition such that K′ acts diagonally on the set of blocks which
belong to one part of the partition and K′ is the direct product of these diagonal
subgroups. This partition of the set of blocks is clearly A-invariant and it follows
that A acts transitively on the set of factors of the direct product, hence K′ is a
minimal normal subgroup of A.

Let G = Nl ⊳ Nl−1 ⊳ ··· ⊳ N1 = A be a normal series of length l between G

and A. Let j be the largest index with K′ ⊆ Nj.

If j = l, i.e., G contains K′, then |K : G ∩ K| ≤ |K : K′| ≤ 2t < 5n−t.
Otherwise Nj+1 ∩ K′ is normal in Nj and it is properly contained in K′. Since
Nj is transitive, we see that in fact K′ is a minimal normal subgroup in Nj (and
not just in A). Hence Nj+1 ∩ K′ = 1, thus K′ centralizes Nj+1. Now Nj+1 is
transitive, hence its centralizer is semiregular. However K′ acts on B1 as Ak which
is impossible.

This completes the proof of the claim.

Now the permutation group GK/K is transitive on t points and it is subnormal
in A/K, so we have |A : GK| = |A/K : GK/K| ≤ 5t−1. Using the claim we see
that

|A : G| = |A : GK||GK : G| = |A : GK||K : G ∩ K| ≤ 5n−1.

Thus the result holds.

(cid:3)

Using the classiﬁcation theorem via improved versions [KW], [M] of the Praeger-
Saxl result one can improve the above bound. For example the second author [M]
shows that a primitive group H of degree k not containing Ak has order |H| < ck
where c = 2.6. This easily implies the bound |H| ≤ 3k−1. Substituting this bound
in the above proof we obtain that |A : G| ≤ 3n−1. It would be interesting to see
whether in fact |A : G| ≤ 2n holds. This would be essentially best possible, since if
n is a power of 2, then the Sylow 2-subgroup P of Sn contains a regular elementary
abelian 2-subgroup of index 2n/2n (which is necessarily subnormal in P ). Note
also that by use of [M, Corollary 1.4] the bound |A : G| ≤ 2n−1 holds in case A is
primitive, unless n = 8, A = AGL3(2), and G is regular.

In later sections we will need an improvement (relying on the classiﬁcation the-

orem) of the previous bound in a special case.
Theorem 8.2. Let G ⊳ A ≤ Sn. If G is transitive, then |A : G| ≤ 168(n−1)/7.
Proof. We may use the notations and the argument of Theorem 8.1. For this
purpose consider a counterexample with n minimal. For convenience set c = 1681/7.

By the remark after Theorem 8.1, A cannot be a primitive permutation group.

Thus t ≥ 2 and 1 < k < n.

20

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

We may also assume that |H1| > ck−1. Furthermore, H1 not only does not
contain Ak for k ≥ 8, by the proof of Theorem 8.1, but it cannot contain Ak even
for k = 5, 6, and 7. (For k = 6 we have |K : K′| ≤ 4t, but this is also suﬃcient
for our purposes.) Taking this a step forward we also see that H1 cannot be any of
the groups appearing in (ii), (iii) and (iv) of [M, Corollary 1.4]. We conclude that
case (i) of [M, Corollary 1.4] holds. Using the bound |H1| > ck−1, we may exclude
two more groups from the list. Thus H1 must be AGL1(5) for k = 5, AGL3(2) for
k = 8, AGL2(3) for k = 9, or AGL4(2) for k = 16.

As in the proof of Theorem 8.1, we get

|A : G| = |A : GK||GK : G| = |A : GK||K : G ∩ K| ≤ ct−1 |K : G ∩ K| .

But |K : G ∩ K| ≤ b(H1)(a(H1))t/2 ≤ |H1|t/2 ≤ cn−t, where the ﬁrst inequality
follows from Theorems 2.3 and 7.2 and the second inequality from the fact that
t ≥ 2.
(cid:3)

9. Normalizers of primitive groups – Abelian composition factors

We consider the situation G ⊳ A ≤ Sn, G primitive and want to bound a(A/G).
We ﬁrst consider the case when the socle of G is abelian. To deal with this case,
we need the following result on primitive linear groups.

Theorem 9.1. Let V be a ﬁnite vector space of order n = pb deﬁned over a ﬁeld
of prime order p. Let B be a subgroup of GL(V ) = GLb(p) which acts primitively
(and irreducibly) on V . Let F be a maximal ﬁeld such that B embeds in ΓLF (V ).
Let |F| = pf and let d = dimF V (so d = b/f ). Then one of the following holds.

(1) d = 1 and a(B) ≤ (n − 1)f ≤ (n − 1) log n; or
(2) d > 1 and a(B) < n for n > 316.

Furthermore a(B) < n2/61/2 unless n = 9 and B = GL2(3).

Proof. Every normal subgroup of a primitive linear subgroup of GL(V ) acts homo-
geneously on V . In particular, any abelian subgroup normalized by B acts homo-
geneously and so is cyclic by Schur’s Lemma. Let C be the subgroup of nonzero
elements in F (viewing F as a subring of End(V )). Note that C is normalized by
B and, for d = 1, contains the centralizer of B. We may replace B by BC and so
assume that C ≤ B.

Let E = EndB(V ) with q = |E|. The algebra generated by C is F and |F| = qe

for some integer e.

Let B0 be the centralizer of C in B. Note that C is the center of B0. We claim
that B0 acts irreducibly on V considered as a vector space over F . For let U denote
V as a B0-module over F . Then V ′ := V ⊗E F ∼= ⊕U σ, where the sum is over the
elements of Gal(F | E). Since B acts absolutely irreducibly on V (over E), B acts
irreducibly on V ′. Note that B/B0 acts regularly on the set {U σ} and so B0 must
act irreducibly on each U σ and so, in particular, on U as claimed.

Note that a(B) = a(B0)e for B/B0 is cyclic of order e.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

21

Let R be a normal subgroup of B contained in B0 minimal with respect to not
being contained in C. If none exists, then B0 = C, d = 1 and B′ is cyclic and
the ﬁrst conclusion allowed holds. So assume that this is not the case. Let W be
an irreducible F [R]-submodule of V , which, as an F [R]-module, is a direct sum of
copies of W . Let F ′ = EndR(W ).

We claim that F ′ = F . The center of the centralizer of R in GL(V ) is the group
of units of F ′. This is normalized by B and so by the choice of C must just be C,
whence F = F ′. Let dR denote dimF W .

If R is abelian then so is RC. But then RC is cyclic by Schur’s Lemma and so
RC = C by our choice of C. In particular, every characteristic abelian subgroup of
B0 is central and contained in C.

So there are two possibilities for R.

1. R is of symplectic type with R/Z(R) of order r2a for some prime r and integer
a. Since Z(R) ≤ C, it follows that r|qe − 1 and dR = ra. By [LMM2, Lemma 1.7]
in this case R/Z(R) is a completely reducible FrB0-module under conjugation.

2. R is the central product of t isomorphic quasisimple groups Qi, 1 ≤ i ≤ t.
Since R acts homogeneously on V and since F ′ = F , it follows that W is of the form
W1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Wt where Wi is absolutely irreducible over F (and the tensor product
is taken over F ). Thus dR = (dimF W1)t.

Choose a maximal collection of non-cyclic subgroups described above which pair-
wise commute. Denote these by J1, . . . , Jm. Let J = J1 ··· Jm be the central
product of these subgroups.

We next claim that CB0 (J) = C. Suppose not. By the maximality condition,
any B-normal subgroup of CB0 (J) minimal with respect to not being contained in
C is one of the Ji. However, Ji is nonabelian and so is not contained in CB0 (J).

In particular B0/C embeds in the direct product of the automorphism groups
of the Ji/Z(Ji). Since J is the central product of the Ji, J acts homogeneously
and F is a splitting ﬁeld for the irreducible constituents for each Ji, it follows that
d = dimF V ≥ Q di where di = dJi.

Thus, a(B) ≤ f (pf − 1) Q ei, where the ei are deﬁned as follows.
If Ji is of symplectic type with Ji/Z(Ji) of order r2 ai

i

(completely reducible) action of B0 on Ji/Z(Ji), we have a(Bi) ≤ (r2ai
Theorem 6.5. In this case we set ei = r6.5ai

.

i

, then if Bi denotes the
)2.25 by

i

If Ji/Z(Ji) = L1×···×Lt 6= 1 for non-abelian simple groups Li, then if Si denotes
the action of B0 permuting the Lj, we have a(Si) ≤ 24(t−1)/3 by Proposition 6.1.
In this case we set ei = |Out(L1)|t24(t−1)/3. Using Lemma 7.8 we see that

ei ≤ 4t dJi · f t · 24(t−1)/3 ≤ (dJi )4.53f [log dJi ].

Altogether we see that a(B) ≤ pf · f 1+[log d] · d6.5. On the other hand n = pf d.

From this, by a tedious calculation, it follows that a(B) < n whenever n ≥ 240
(for d > 1). With more calculations it is possible to show that a(B) < n whenever
n > 316 and d > 1.

22

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

Finally, consider the last statement of the theorem. By similar calculations as
before, it follows that a(B) < n2/61/2 whenever n ≥ 216 (even if d = 1). So assume
that n < 216 and also that d > 1.

If pf = 2 then no Ji is a group of symplectic type and so a closer look at our

previous estimates yields a(B) < n2/61/2 and a(B) < n (if d > 1).

Let pf = 3. Then d ≤ 10, a Ji can be a group of symplectic type, but, in
this case, we must have ri = 2. Using this observation, a simple calculation gives
a(B) < n2/61/2 whenever n > 81.

Let pf = 4. Then d ≤ 7, a Ji can be a group of symplectic type, but, in this
case, we must have ri = 3 and ai = 1. Using the fact that |Sp2(3)| = 24, the
exponent 6.5 in the above estimate can be improved in this special case and we get
a(B) < n2/61/2 whenever n > 64. The same bound holds even in case d = 1 and
n > 64.

Let pf ≥ 5. Here d ≤ 6 and a very similar argument yields the desired bound.
Thus we only need to check the last statement of the theorem for n ≤ 81. This

(cid:3)

was done by GAP [GAP].

Theorem 9.2. Let G ⊳ A ≤ GL(V ) with |V | = pf = n. Assume that G acts
irreducibly on V . Then either A is metacyclic and |A/G| < n or a(A/G) < n for
n > 316.

Proof. Consider a counterexample with n minimal.

If A acts primitively on V , then, by Theorem 9.1, either a(A) < n, or A′ is cyclic,

A embeds in ΓL1(pf ) and |A| = a(A) < nf .

Consider the latter case. Since G acts irreducibly on V over the prime ﬁeld,
it follows that |G| ≥ f (a group of order less than f will not have an irreducible
module of dimension f ). Thus |A/G| < n.

So we may assume that A acts imprimitively.
So V = V1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Vt with t > 1 and A permutes the Vi. Note that since G is
irreducible, G must permute the Vi transitively as well. We may assume that this
is done in such a way that V1 has minimal dimension over Fp. Set m = |V1|. Since
t > 1 and since A is irreducible on V , we have m > 2.

Let K be the subgroup of A ﬁxing each Vi. Let Ai be the image of NA(Vi)
acting on Vi and deﬁne Gi similarly. Since V1 is minimal, it follows that A1 acts
primitively on V1.

Now a(A/G) ≤ a(A/GK)a(K/(G ∩ K). By Theorem 7.4, a(A/GK) ≤ 6t/4. By
Lemma 7.2 and Theorem 9.1, a(K/(G ∩ K) ≤ a(A1)t/2 < (m2/61/2)t/2 unless m is
9 and A1 = GL2(3). Thus, if m 6= 9, we have a(A/G) < 6t/4(m2/61/2)t/2 = n.

Assume now that m = 9 and A1 = GL2(3).
By the restriction n > 316, we have t 6= 2, 4. Then Lemma 7.2 implies that
< mt = n. (cid:3)

a(K/(G ∩ K)) ≤ a(A1)3t/8 = 483t/8. Hence a(A/G) ≤ (cid:0)61/4483/8(cid:1)t

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

23

Theorem 9.3. Let G and A be primitive permutation groups of degree n with
G ⊳ A. Then a(A/G) < n for n > 316.

Proof. We consider the various cases in the Aschbacher-O’Nan-Scott Theorem.

In all cases, G contains E := F ∗(A). The result follows by Theorem 9.2 if E is
abelian. So we may assume that E is a direct product of t copies of a nonabelian
simple group L of order l. Let K denote the subgroup of A stabilizing all the
components.

Suppose ﬁrst that E = E1×E2 with E1 ∼= E2 the two minimal normal subgroups
of A. In this case t = 2s for some integer s and n = |E1| = ls. Then the groups
GK/K ⊳ A/K can be considered as transitive subgroups of Ss and so by Theorem
7.4, a(A/GK) ≤ 6s/4. By Lemma 7.2, a(GK/G) = a(K/G ∩ K) ≤ |Out(L)|s.
Hence a(A/G) ≤ n1/4 · 6s/4 unless L = L3(4) by a remark after Lemma 7.7. This
is certainly less than n since l ≥ 60. The same follows for L = L3(4) by direct
computation.

In the remaining cases, E is the unique minimal normal subgroup of A, the
groups GK/K ⊳ A/K are transitive subgroups of St and so as in the previous case,
we see that a(A/GK) ≤ 6t/4. Here n ≥ mt where m is at least the minimal degree
of a nontrivial permutation representation of L. By Lemmas 7.2 and 7.7 it follows
that a(GK/G) ≤ |Out(L)|t/2 ≤ (2√m)t/2. Hence a(A/G) ≤ n1/4 · 2t/2 · 6t/4 which
is less than n if m ≥ 5.

(cid:3)

10. Normalizers of primitive groups – Sizes

We continue to consider the situation G ⊳ A ≤ Sn, G primitive and want to
bound |A/G|. We ﬁrst consider the case when the socle of G is abelian. To deal
with this case, we need the following result on primitive linear groups.

Theorem 10.1. Let V be a ﬁnite vector space of order n = pb deﬁned over a ﬁeld
of prime order p. Let A be a subgroup of GL(V ) = GLb(p) which acts primitively
(and irreducibly) on V . Let F be a maximal ﬁeld such that A embeds in ΓLF (V ).
Let G be a normal subgroup of A which acts irreducibly on V . Let |F| = pf and let
d = dimF V (so d = b/f ). Then a(A)b(A/G) < f · pf · d2 log d+3.
Proof. We use the description of the structure of A found in the proof of Theorem
9.1 (where this group was denoted by B). By the fourth paragraph of the proof of
Theorem 4.1 we see that G contains every non-solvable normal subgroup of A which
is minimal with respect to being non-central. From this the result easily follows.
We note here that, with little modiﬁcation and in case J 6= 1, the proof of
Theorem 4.1 essentially bounds |A|/(b(G)|J|) = (a(A)b(A/G))/|J|, where J is the
product of all solvable normal subgroups of A (satisfying the conditions of Theo-
rem 4.1) which are minimal with respect to being non-central. We also note that
(log n)2 log log n is close to d2 log d. However the argument in Theorem 9.1 is to be
used together with Lemma 7.8 but excluding Theorem 6.5.
(cid:3)

We continue with a simple lemma.

24

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

Lemma 10.2. Let us use the notations and assumptions of the statement of Theo-
rem 10.1. Put A0 = A ∩ GLF (V ). Suppose that A has a unique normal subgroup J
contained in A0 which is minimal subject to being not contained in the multiplicative
group C of F viewed as a subset of End(V ). If |A/G| ≥ n, then J ≤ G.

Proof. Let the multiplicative group of the ﬁeld K = EndG(V ) be L.

We may assume that G is not cyclic. Indeed, otherwise |A| < |L| · |G| < n · |G|

since A acts on G by conjugation with kernel contained in L.

By the facts that G is not cyclic and a Singer cycle is self centralizing, we must

have df ≥ 2 and |K| ≤ pdf /r where r is the smallest prime factor of df .

We may also assume that G is metacyclic. Indeed, G0 = G ∩ A0 is normal in
A, is contained in A0, thus it may be assumed that G0 ≤ C is cyclic and thus G is
metacyclic.

By considering the action of A0 on G, we see that |A0| ≤ |L| · |G| since the
kernel of the action is L ∩ A0, G0 ≤ Z(A0), and G/G0 is cyclic. From this we have
|A/G| ≤ f · |L| < f · pdf /r ≤ pdf = n.

(cid:3)

We next present two useful bounds for |A/G| in terms of n.

Lemma 10.3. Let n, A and G be as in Theorem 10.1. Then we have the following.

(1) |A/G| < n for n > 316;
(2) a(A)b(A/G) < n2/61/2 unless n = 9 and A = GL2(3).

Proof. In case A/G is solvable, this follows from Theorems 9.2 and 9.1. Thus we
may assume that A/G is not solvable. An easy computation using Theorem 10.1
shows that |A/G| < n for n ≥ 2136 and a(A)b(A/G) < n2/61/2 for n ≥ 234. It
is easy to see by the structure of a primitive linear group (see Theorem 9.1), that
if pf = 2 (where p and f are as in Theorem 10.1) and A/G is not solvable, then
n ≥ 2243. Thus we may also assume that pf ≥ 3 (and d ≥ 4, where d is as in
Theorem 10.1).

Now straightforward calculations using Theorem 10.1 give |A/G| < n for n ≥ 354

and a(A)b(A/G) < n2/61/2 for n ≥ 314.

Let us adopt the notations and assumptions of the proof of Theorem 9.1 (with

B replaced by A and B0 replaced by A0).

Assume that pf = 3. Then we may assume that 16 < d ≤ 53 and d ≤ 13 in the
respective cases. A Ji can be a group of symplectic type, but, in this case, we must
have ri = 2. As in Example 3.3 the normalizer Ni in GL2ai (3) of such a Ji satisﬁes
Ni/(JiZ) ∼= Oǫ
2ai(2) where Z is the group of scalars. (This is because |Z(Ji)| must
be 2 since it divides pf − 1.) A straightforward computation using the structure of
A (and G) gives the result.

We only comment on the bound (1) in case n = 332 and when the product
J of all normal subgroups of A contained in A0 which are not contained in the
multiplicative group, C of F viewed as a subset of End(V ), is solvable. When J is
itself a normal subgroup of A contained in A0 which is minimal subject to being

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

25

not contained in C (a unique such), then J ≤ G, by Lemma 10.2, and so we ﬁnd
that |A/G| < n. Otherwise, if J is a product of more than one Ji, then |A| < n
by the fact that the index of a proper subgroup in Oǫ
10(2), apart from the simple
subgroup SOǫ

10(2) whose index is 2, is at least 495.

Assume that pf = 4. Then 13 ≤ d ≤ 42 and d ≤ 11 in the respective cases. A Ji
can be a group of symplectic type, but, in this case, we must have ri = 3. We are
assuming that A/G is not solvable. As a result, for (2), only the case d = 9 has to
be checked. The bound in (1) is slightly more complicated to establish (but true).
To ﬁnish the proof of (2) we may assume that pf ≥ 5. Then 4 ≤ d ≤ 9. Using this
information and Theorem 10.1 we see that a(A)b(A/G) < f·pf ·d2 log d+3 < n2/61/2.
Thus from now on we only consider (1).

Let pf = 5. Then we may assume that 11 ≤ d ≤ 36. In fact, by use of Theorem
10.1 we may assume that d ≤ 29. With a computation similar to the ones above it
is possible to deduce (1) in this special case.

We only comment on the case n = 516 and when the product J of all normal
subgroups of A contained in A0 which are minimal subject to being not contained
in C is solvable. When J is itself a normal subgroup of A contained in A0 which
is minimal subject to being not contained in C (a unique such), then J ≤ G, by
Lemma 10.2, and so we ﬁnd that |A/G| < n. Otherwise, if J is a product of more
than one Ji, then |A| < n by the fact that the subgroups Sp6(2) × Sp2(2) and
Sp4(2) × Sp4(2) of Sp8(2) are relatively small.

Let pf = 7. We may assume that 10 ≤ d ≤ 17 (by use of Theorem 10.1). A

straightforward computation gives the result.

Similarly, if pf = 8, 9 or 11, then we may assume that d satisﬁes 9 ≤ d ≤ 16,
9 ≤ d ≤ 15 or 8 ≤ d ≤ 11 in the respective cases. Straightforward computations
give the result.

Let pf = 13. We may assume that d = 7, 8 or 9. A straightforward computation
gives the result except when d = 8 and A does not contain a non-solvable normal
subgroup which is minimal subject to being not contained in C. In this latter case
we may proceed as in the case n = 516 described above.

Let pf = 16. We may assume that d = 7 or d = 8. In this case there is nothing

to do since we are assuming that A/G is non-solvable.

Let pf = 17. We may assume that d = 7 and so there is nothing to do.

Let pf = 19. We may assume that d = 6. However there is nothing to do since

A/G is non-solvable.

By pf ≥ 23 and Theorem 10.1, we have d = 4 or d = 5. Both these cases can

easily be handled using the assumption that n > 316.

This ﬁnishes the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

Theorem 10.4. Let G ⊳ A ≤ GL(V ) with |V | = pd = n. Assume that G acts
irreducibly on V . Then |A/G| < n for n > 316.

26

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

Proof. By Lemma 10.3 we may assume that A acts imprimitively on V . By Theorem
9.2 we may also assume that A/G is not solvable.

We may proceed almost as in the relevant paragraph of Theorem 4.2. We may
decompose V in the form V = V1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Vt with t > 1 maximal such that A
permutes the Vi. Note that G must permute the Vi transitively as well since G is
irreducible. Let K be the subgroup of A ﬁxing each Vi. Let Ai be the action of
NA(Vi) on Vi and deﬁne Gi similarly.

Now G1 must act irreducibly on V1 and so by Theorem 10.1 we have the inequal-
, where m = |V1| = pf1d1 for certain integers

ity a(A1)b(A1/G1) < f1· pf1 · d2 log d1+3
f1 and d1. Note that n = mt.

By Theorem 2.3, we have

|A/G| = a(A/G)b(A/G) ≤ a(A/GK)b(A/GK) · a(K/(G ∩ K))b(A1/G1).

We have b(A/GK) < tlog t by Theorem 5.1. We also have a(A/GK) ≤ 6t/4 by

Theorem 7.4. Thus Lemma 7.2, Theorem 9.1, and Theorem 4.2 give
|A/G| ≤ 6t/4 · tlog t · a(A1)t/2 · b(A1/G1) < 6t/4 · tlog t · (m2/61/2)
· (log m)2 log log m,
provided that m 6= 9. However we can improve this bound by use of the inequality

t/2

a(A1)t/2b(A1/G1) ≤ f (m)t/2(a(A1)b(A1/G1))/f (m),

where f (m) is any upper bound for a(A1). For example if m 6= 9 then we get

|A/G| < 6t/4 · tlog t · (m2/61/2)

· (a(A1)b(A1/G1))/(m2/61/2).

t/2

First it will be convenient to deal with the case when t = 2 or t = 4. Then
m 6= 9. Since b(A/GK) = 1, the previous inequality shows that we are done unless
b(A1/G1) 6= 1. On the other hand, if b(A1/G1) 6= 1, then Lemma 10.3 gives

a(A1)b(A1/G1) < m2/61/2,

provided that m 6= 9.

Now let t be diﬀerent from 2 and 4 but at most 16.
Assume ﬁrst that m 6= 4. By Lemma 7.2 and Theorem 8.2,
|A/G| < 168(t−1)/7 · (m8/3/1688/21)

3t/8

· (a(A1)b(A1/G1))/(m8/3/1688/21) <

< mt · (a(A1)b(A1/G1))/(m8/3/1688/21) · 168−1/7

(since m8/3/1688/21 > m2/61/2 > a(A1) for m ≥ 5 (and m diﬀerent from 9),
and m8/3/1688/21 > a(A1) for m = 3 and m = 9). Again, we are ﬁnished if
b(A1/G1) = 1. Assume that b(A1/G1) 6= 1. If m = 81 then we can use GAP [GAP]
to arrive to a conclusion. Otherwise it is easy to see that m ≥ 625. Since d1 ≥ 4,
we certainly have

a(A1)b(A1/G1) < f1 · pf1 · d2 log d1+3

1

< m8/3/1688/21

for m ≥ 625, unless possibly if pf = 2 or pf = 3. If pf = 2, then d1 ≥ 35, by the
structure of A1, and so the previous inequality holds. We also have the previous
inequality in case pf = 3 since we may assume by the structure of A1 that d1 ≥ 8.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

If m = 4 then Lemma 7.2 and Theorem 8.2 give us |A/G| ≤ 168(t−1)/7 · 63t/8.

This is not necessarily less than 4t, however it is for t ≤ 16.

Now let t ≥ 17.
By Lemma 7.2 and Theorem 8.2,

|A/G| < 168(t−1)/7 · (m3/1683/7)

t/3

· (a(A1)b(A1/G1))/(m3/1683/7) <

< mt · (a(A1)b(A1/G1))/(m3/1683/7) · 168−1/7

(since m3/1683/7 > m2/61/2 when m ≥ 4, and m3/1683/7 > a(A1) for m = 3 and
m = 9). We may assume that b(A1/G1) 6= 1. Then m = 81 or m ≥ 625 by the
structure of A1. If m = 81 then we have a(A1)b(A1/G1) < m3/1683/7 by use of
GAP [GAP]. If m ≥ 625 then we arrive to a conclusion by use of three paragraphs
up, noting that m8/3/1688/21 < m3/1683/7 for m ≥ 3.
Theorem 10.5. Let G and A be permutation groups with G ⊳ A ≤ Sn. Suppose
that G is primitive and |A/G| ≥ n. Then A and G are aﬃne primitive permutation
groups and n ≤ 316.
Proof. If A is an aﬃne primitive permutation group then the result follows from
Theorem 10.4. Otherwise we may mimic the proof of Theorem 9.3 by noting that
we must replace 6s/4 by 168s/7 and 6t/4 by 168t/7 in the respective cases (due to
Schreier’s conjecture and Theorem 8.2).

11. Small linear groups

In this section we will ﬁnish the proof of the ﬁrst half of Theorem 1.1.
Let G and A be permutation groups with G ⊳ A ≤ Sn. Suppose that G is
primitive and |A/G| ≥ n. We must show that the pair (n, A/G) is one of the eleven
exceptions in Theorem 1.1.

By Theorem 10.5 it is suﬃcient to consider aﬃne primitive permutation groups

of degrees at most 316.

Let V be a ﬁnite vector space of size n with n ≤ 316. Opposed to the notation
of the statement of the theorem, let G and A be groups such that G ⊳ A ≤ GL(V ).
Assume that G (and thus A) acts irreducibly on V . We must classify all possibilities
for which |A/G| ≥ n.

Let us ﬁrst assume that A acts primitively on V . We use the notations and
assumptions of Theorem 9.1 and its proof (with B replaced by A and B0 replaced
by A0). We put n = pb for a prime p and integer b with the property that A is a
subgroup of GL(V ) = GLb(p) acting primitively (and irreducibly) on V . Let F be
a maximal ﬁeld such that A embeds in ΓLF (V ). Let |F| = pf and let d = dimF V
(so d = b/f ). Let the multiplicative group of F , viewed as a subset of End(V ), be
denoted by C.

If d = 1 then Theorem 9.2 gives |A/G| < n. Thus assume that d > 1.
As in the proof of Theorem 9.1, let J be the product of all normal subgroups of

A contained in A0 which are minimal subject to not being contained in C.

28

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

Assume that d is a prime. Then, by the proof of Theorem 9.1, J itself is a normal
subgroup of A contained in A0 which is minimal subject to not being contained in
C. Moreover J is either a quasisimple group or is a group of symplectic type with
|J/Z(J)| = d2. In both of these cases we must have J ≤ G, by Lemma 10.2.

Assume that J is a quasisimple group. By Lemma 7.8 (and the proof of Theorem
9.1), we have |A/G| ≤ 4(pf − 1)df 2. This is less than pdf for d ≥ 5. Assume that
d = 2. If A5 is a factor group of J, then |A/G| ≤ 2f (pf − 1) < p2f . Otherwise, by
Dickson’s theorem on subgroups of GL2(pf ), we have |A/G| ≤ 2f 2(pf − 1) < p2f
if p is odd, and |A/G| ≤ f 2(pf − 1) < p2f if p = 2. Now assume that d = 3. Then,
by information from [KL], we ﬁnd that |A/G| ≤ 6f 2(pf − 1). This is smaller than
p3f unless p = f = 2. If d = 3 and p = f = 2, then, by [GAP], we get the desired
estimate |A/G| ≤ 4f (pf − 1) = 24 < 64 = n.

Let J be a group of symplectic type with |J/Z(J)| = d2 where d is a prime.
Then |A/G| ≤ |Sp2(d)|f (pf − 1) < d3f (pf − 1) < n for d ≥ 5, and also for d = 3
and pf > 4. If d = 3 and pf = 4, then |A/G| ≤ d3f = 54 < 64. Let d = 2. It is
then easy to see that |A/G| ≤ 6f ((pf − 1)/2) < p2f since p > 2.

From now on we assume that d is not a prime and larger than 1.

In this paragraph let pf = 2. By the structure of A described in the proof of
Theorem 9.1 we know that all normal subgroups of A contained in A0 and minimal
with respect to being not contained in C are non-solvable. Moreover J has at most
two non-abelian simple composition factors, since d ≤ 25. By this, we immediately
see, as in the proof of Theorem 9.1, that |A/G| ≤ 32d. This is less than 2d unless
d ≤ 8. If d = 6 or 8, then |A/G| ≤ 4d < 2d. For d = 4 the result follows by [GAP].

From now on we assume that pf > 2.

In this paragraph we deal with the cases when d = 6, 10, 14, or 15. In these
cases d is a product of two primes r1 and r2. First suppose that J is not solvable. If
A has no solvable normal subgroup contained in A0 which is minimal with respect
to being noncentral, then it is easy to see that |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · 42f 2d < pf d
since pf > 2. Otherwise we get |A/G| ≤ f 2(pf − 1) · 4r1 · r2
5 (for a certain choice
of r1 and r2). This is always less than pdf unless d = 6 and pf = 3 or 4. If d = 6
and pf = 3, then in the previous bound we must have r2 = 2 and thus |A/G| < n.
If d = 6 and pf = 4, then we must have r1 = 2 and r2 = 3. In this special case we
can modify our bound to |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · 2 · 35 = 12 · 35 < 46 = n. Thus we
may assume that J is solvable. In this case d divides pf − 1, and since n ≤ 316, we
are left to consider only the case d = 6 and pf = 7 or 13 when |A| < n.

We are left to consider the cases when d = 4, 8, 9, 12, or 16.

Let d = 4.

First assume that J is solvable and it is the unique normal subgroup of A con-
tained in A0 which is minimal subject to being not contained in C. By Lemma
10.2 we may assume that J ≤ G. For pf ≥ 7 we can bound |A/G| by f ((qf −
1)/2)|Sp4(2)| = 360f (qf − 1) < p4f . We are left to consider the cases when pf = 3
and pf = 5. If pf = 3, d = 4 and |A/G| ≥ 81, then (n, A/G) = (34, O−4 (2)), while
if pf = 5, d = 4 and |A/G| ≥ 625, then (n, A/G) = (54, Sp4(2)). Now assume that
J is solvable and it is the product of two normal subgroups, say J1 and J2 of A

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

contained in A0 which are minimal subject to being not contained in C. If f = 1
then G contains one (if not both) of these normal subgroups, say J1. Furthermore,
since J1 is not irreducible on V , the irreducible group G properly contains J1. Thus
|A/G| ≤ 4 · 36 · ((pf − 1)/2) · (1/2) = 36(p − 1) < p4. We may now assume that
f ≥ 2 (and also that p is odd). In this case we only use the fact that |G| ≥ 4 to
conclude that |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1)16 · 36 · (1/4) = 144f (pf − 1). We already know
from the same paragraph that this is less than p4f for pf ≥ 9.

Secondly assume that A has no solvable normal subgroup contained in A0 which
is minimal subject to not being contained in C. In this case J has at most two
non-abelian composition factors and so |A/G| ≤ f 3(pf − 1)· 43 · 2 = 128f 3(pf − 1),
by the second half of the proof of Theorem 9.1. From this we get |A/G| < p4f unless
possibly if pf = 3, 4, 8, 9 or 16. When J has a unique non-abelian composition
factor, then we may sharpen our bound to |A/G| ≤ 16f 2(pf − 1), and this is smaller
than p4f for the remaining ﬁve values of pf . Thus J has exactly two non-abelian
composition factors. In this case we can apply Dickson’s theorem on subgroups of
GL2(pf ) to reﬁne our bound on |A/G| even further. This is 8f 3(pf − 1) which is
smaller than p4f for the remaining ﬁve values of pf .

Thirdly there are two normal subgroups of A contained in A0 which are minimal
subject to not being contained in C. One is J1, a symplectic 2-group, and one is J2,
a quasisimple group. In this case we have |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1)· 2f · 24 = 48f 2(pf − 1).
This is less than p4f where p > 2, unless pf = 3. But pf = 3 cannot occur in this
case since J2 ≤ GL2(3) is solvable.

From now on let d be 8, 9, 12 or 16.

In this paragraph suppose that A has no solvable normal subgroup contained in
A0 which is minimal subject to not being contained in C. In this case the number,
say r of non-abelian composition factors of J is at most 4. If r = 4 then d = 16
and so pf = 3. In this case it is easy to see that |A/G| ≤ 98304f 5(pf − 1) < 316.
Let r = 3. Then d = 8 or d ≥ 12. In the ﬁrst case we can use Dickson’s theorem to
conclude that a quasisimple subgroup Q of GL2(pf ) satisﬁes |Out(S/Z(S))| ≤ 2f .
This implies that |A/G| ≤ 48f 4(pf − 1) < p8f . In case d ≥ 12 we can use our usual
bound |A/G| ≤ f 4(pf − 1) · 43 · 16 · 6 = 6144f 4(pf − 1) < p12f . Finally let r ≤ 2.
Then |A/G| ≤ 512f 3(pf − 1). This is less than pf d for d ≥ 8 (and pf > 2).

In the remaining cases A has a solvable normal subgroup contained in A0 which
is minimal subject to not being contained in C. This implies that the greatest
common divisor of d and pf − 1 is larger than 1. This, the above, and the fact that
n ≤ 316 imply that the only cases to deal with are the following: d = 8 and pf = 3,
5, 7, 9; d = 9 and pf = 4, 7; d = 12 and pf = 3, 4; and d = 16 and pf = 3.

Let d = 8. We may assume that A has a solvable normal subgroup contained
in A0 which is minimal subject to not being contained in C. First suppose that J
is not solvable. Then J has one or two non-abelian composition factors. Such a
composition factor can be considered as a subgroup of L2(pf ) or of L4(pf ). In the
ﬁrst case we must have pf ≥ 5. Suppose J has exactly one non-abelian composition
factor. If this is a subgroup of L2(pf ), then, by Dickson’s theorem, we have the
estimate |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · 2f · |Sp4(2)| · 24 < p8f for pf ≥ 5. If this is considered
as a subgroups of L4(pf ), then |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1)· 16f ·|Sp2(2)|· 4 < p8f . Finally, if

30

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

J has exactly two non-abelian composition factors, then these must be subgroups
of L2(pf ), and we have |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · (2f )2 · 2 · |Sp2(2)| · 4 < p8f for pf ≥ 5.
Thus we may assume that J is solvable. First assume that pf = 9. If A has more
than one normal subgroup contained in A0 which is minimal subject to not being
contained in C, then |A| ≤ 2 · 8 · |Sp4(2)||Sp2(2)| · 26 < 98. Otherwise we may
assume that J ≤ G, by Lemma 10.2, and so |A/G| ≤ 2 · 8 · |Sp6(2)| < 98. We
may now assume that pf = 3, 5, or 7. In all of these cases A0 = A. First suppose
that A has more than one normal subgroup which is minimal subject to not being
contained in C. If pf 6= 3, then |A/G| ≤ 16 · 3 · |Sp4(2)||Sp2(2)| < p8f . Let pf = 3.
If |G| ≥ 16, then |A/G| ≤ 8 · |O−4 (2)||O−2 (2)| < 38. Otherwise |G ∩ J| = 8 and
in fact |G| = 8. But such a group G cannot act irreducibly on V . We conclude
that J is the unique normal subgroup of A which is minimal subject to not being
If pf = 7, then |A/G| ≤ |O−6 (2)| < 78. Let
contained in C. Thus J ≤ G.
pf = 5. Assume that A is the full normalizer of J in GL(V ).
If G = J, then
(n, A/G) = (58, Sp6(2)). Otherwise, since A/J ∼= Sp6(2) is simple, G = A. Thus
we may assume that A/J is a proper subgroup of Sp6(2). By [DM, pp. 319], we
have |A/G| ≤ |A/J| ≤ |Sp6(2)|/28 < 58. We remain with the case pf = 3.
If
G = J and J ≤ A has index at most 2 in the full normalizer of J in GL(V ), then
|A/G| > n and (n, A/G) = (38, O−6 (2)), (38, SO−6 (2)), (38, O+
6 (2)) or (38, SO+
6 (2)).
Suppose now that J ≤ A has index larger than 2 in the full normalizer of J in
6 (2) ∼= A8 and SO−6 (2) ∼= U4(2) are simple groups with minimal
GL(V ). Since SO+
index of a proper subgroup 8 and 27 respectively (for the latter see [DM, pp. 317]),
we immediately get |A/G| ≤ |A/J| < 38 in the remaining cases.

Let d = 9. We may assume that A has a solvable normal subgroup contained in
A0 which is minimal subject to not being contained in C. If J is non-solvable, then,
by the structure of A (and G), |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · 4 · 3f · 32 · |Sp2(3)| < p9f . Thus
J is solvable. If pf = 7 then an easy computation yields |A| ≤ 6 · 81 · |Sp4(3)| < 79.
We assume that pf = 4. Now J is the product of one or two normal subgroups of A
not contained in C. If one, then we may assume by Lemma 10.2 that J ≤ G. In this
case we get |A/G| ≤ 2·|Sp4(3)| < 49. In the other case we get |A| ≤ 6·81·|Sp2(3)|2.
Since |G| > 2, we see that |A/G| < 49.

Let d = 12. We may again assume that A has a solvable normal subgroup
contained in A0 which is minimal subject to not being contained in C. We may also
assume that J is not solvable since pf is 3 or 4. If J has one non-abelian composition
factor, then |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · 4 · 6f · 16 · |O−4 (2)| = f 2(pf − 1) · 46080 < p12f
for both pf = 3 and pf = 4. Finally, if J has two non-abelian composition factors,
then |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · 42 · 4 · f 2 · 2 · 9 · |Sp2(3)| = f 3(pf − 1) · 27648 < p12f for
both pf = 3 and pf = 4.

Let d = 16. Then pf = 3 and A0 = A. From the above we may assume that
A has a solvable normal subgroup which is minimal subject to not being contained
in C. Assume ﬁrst that J is not solvable. Since GL2(3) is solvable and 3 does
not divide 16, we know that J has a unique non-abelian composition factor and
this can be considered as a subgroup of L4(3). From this we arrive to a conclusion
by |A/G| ≤ f (pf − 1) · 4 · (4f ) · |O−4 (2)| · 24 < 316. Thus we may assume that J
is solvable. First assume that A contains more than one normal subgroup which

subgroup of A which is minimal subject to not being contained in C. This implies
that J ≤ G. If G = J and J ≤ A has index at most 2 in the full normalizer of J in
GL(V ), then |A/G| > n and (n, A/G) is (316, O−8 (2)), (316, SO−8 (2)), (316, O+

or (316, SO+

that if J ≤ A has index larger than 2 in the full normalizer of J in GL(V ), then
|A/G| ≤ |A/J| < 316.

8 (2)). Now SOǫ

We may now assume that A acts imprimitively on V . By the proofs of Theorems
9.2 and 10.4 we see that we may assume, in the notations of these proofs, that m = 9
and t = 2 or t = 4. In these cases n = 34 or n = 38. If n = 34, then [GAP] gives
|A/G| < n. So assume that the second case holds. The group A is clearly solvable
and so by Lemmas 7.3 and 7.4 we have |A/G| ≤ 6 · 162 · 3. This is less than 38.

This completes the proof of the ﬁrst half of Theorem 1.1.

12. Normalizers and outer automorphism groups of primitive groups

In this section we prove Theorem 1.2.

Let G be a primitive permutation group of degree n. Assume ﬁrst that the gener-
alized Fitting subgroup E = F ∗(G) of G is nonabelian. By [R, Lemma 1.1] Aut(G)
has a natural embedding into Aut(E) and it acts transitively on the components of
E (this is also true if G has two minimal normal subgroups). The bound follows as
in the proof of the bound for |A/G|.

So suppose that F ∗(G) = V is abelian. If V is central, then n is a prime, G is
cyclic and Out(G) is cyclic of order n − 1. So assume that Z(G) = 1. In this case
the centralizer of G in Sn is 1.

Lemma 12.1. Let G be a primitive aﬃne permutation group of degree n and H a
point stabilizer. Let V = F (G) = F ∗(G). Then |Aut(G) : NSn(G)| = |H 1(H, V )|.

Proof. Let N be the normalizer of G in Sn, then N embeds into A = Aut(G).
Moreover an element ϕ ∈ A is in N exactly when the image of a point stabilizer H
of G under ϕ is also a point stabilizer [DM, 4.2B].

It is easy to see that A acts transitively on the complements of V hence it acts
transitively on the G-conjugacy classes of such complements. It follows that |A : N|
equals the number of G-conjugacy classes of complements, that is, (cid:12)
(cid:12). (cid:3)

(cid:12)H 1(H, V )(cid:12)

In particular, if H 1(H, V ) = 0, our previous estimates apply. So now we consider
the case with H 1(H, V ) 6= 0. So G = V H with H acting faithfully and irreducibly
on V . We ﬁrst point out the following result in [AG1, 2.7 (c)]. See also [G1].

Lemma 12.2. Suppose that H is a ﬁnite group acting irreducibly and faithfully on
V with H 1(H, V ) 6= 0. Then H has a unique minimal normal subgroup N of the
form L1 × ··· × Lt with Li ∼= L a nonabelian simple group. Set Li′ = CN (Li) (the
product of all the other Lj). Moreover, V = ⊕iVi where Vi = [Li, V ] = CV (Li′ ) and
|H 1(H, V )| ≤ |H 1(L1, W )|, where W is any nontrivial irreducible Li-submodule of
V1.

Now we obtain bounds on the size of outer automorphism groups for such groups.

First an example. Let q = 2e, e > 1 and H = L2(q). Let V be the natural module
for H (i.e. 2-dimensional over Fq). Consider G = V.L2(q) acting on V . Then G
is primitive and |Out(G)| = |H 1(H, V )||NSn (G) : G| = q(q − 1)e < (n log n)/2 but
|Out(G)| > n and indeed has order roughly (n log n)/2. We now show that this is
the only example with |Out(G)| ≥ n.
Theorem 12.3. Let G be a primitive aﬃne permutation group of degree n. Let
V = F (G) = F ∗(G) and H 6= 1 a point stabilizer. Assume that H 1(H, V ) 6= 0.
Then either |Out(G)| < n or n = q2 with q = 2e, e > 1 and H = L2(q).

Proof. We use the lemma above and write V = ⊕Vi where Vi = [Li, V ]. Let N be
the normalizer of L1. Then N preserves V1 and indeed N is precisely the stabilizer
of V1. Since H is irreducible on V , N is irreducible on V1. Let E = EndH (V ). So
E is a ﬁeld of size q. By Frobenius reciprocity, E ∼= EndN (V1). Let d = dimE V1
and h1 = |H 1(H, V )|.

So H 1(H, V ) embeds in H 1(L1, U1) where U1 is an L1-submodule of V1. Now

we know that |Out(G)| ≤ (q − 1)h1|NJ (H)/H| where J = Aut(L) ≀ St.

Suppose that t = 1. Then F ∗(H) = L and |Out(G)| ≤ (q − 1)h1|Out(L)|. We

ﬁrst consider some special cases.

If d = 2, then (since we are assuming that h1 > 1), h1 = q. This implies (see
[GH]) that L = L2(q) with q = 2e > 2. Moreover, the equality on h1 implies that
H = L and we are as in the example above.

Suppose that d = 3. Then also by the main result in [GH], it follows that
h1 = q. So |Out(G)| < q(q − 1)p(q3 − 1)/(q − 1) < q3 unless possibly L = A6,
L2(27), L3(4) or L3(16) (see Lemma 7.7). In these exceptional cases |Out(L)| has
order 4, 6, 12 or 24 respectively and the result holds unless possibly q < |Out(L)|.
This easily rules out the ﬁrst two cases (there are no 3-dimensional representations
over a ﬁeld of size q < |Out(L)| cf. [JLPW]). For the latter two groups, there are
no 3-dimensional representations (only projective representations).

So assume that d ≥ 4.
Suppose that |H 1(H, V )| < |V |1/2. Since (by construction), V is an irreducible
Fq[H]-module, |H 1(H, V )| ≤ q(d/2)−1 if d is even and |H 1(H, V )| ≤ q(d−1)/2 if d is
odd.

In this case, the same argument as above applies. We only need to deal with
the four groups as above and only for representations where |Out(L)| is larger than
p(qd − 1)/(q − 1). From [JLPW] we see that the only possibility is that L = A6
and q = 2, d = 4. In that case, |H 1(H, V )| ≤ 2 and we still have the result.

The remaining case is when |H 1(H, V )| = |V |1/2. This can only occur for d = 2
except if H = A6, q = 3 and d = 4 [GH]. So n = 81. In that case, we see that
|Out(G)| ≤ 9 · 2 · 4 = 72 and the result still holds.

Now suppose that t > 1 and n = qdt where d = dimE V1. Then we have
|NJ (H)/H| ≤ |Out(L)|t/2bt where bt is the analogous bound for transitive groups
of degree t. Thus by [GH], |Out(G)| ≤ (q − 1)qd/2|Out(L)|t/2bt. By Theorem 5.1

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

33

and Theorem 7.4, we have bt ≤ 2t·tlog t and it is easy to see that if t ≤ 7 then in fact
bt ≤ 2t holds. Unless L = A6 (which we assume) we have |Out(L)| < qd/(2(q − 1))
by [AG2, Lemma 2.7].

Assuming ﬁrst that q 6= 2 we see that |Out(G)| < qd((t/2)+1)tlog t. It is also clear
that (since L2(3) is solvable) in this case we have qd ≥ 16 and |Out(G)| < qdt
follows for t ≥ 8 (and even for t ≤ 7 by the observation a few lines above).

Finally let q = 2. Then we see that |Out(G)| ≤ 2(d+t+dt)/2 · tlog t. If d ≥ 4 and
t ≥ 8, then this is less than 2dt. Otherwise L = L3(2) and in this case for t ≥ 8
we have |Out(G)| ≤ 2 · 2t/2 · 2t · tlog t < 23t. If t ≤ 7, then |Out(G)| < 2dt follows,
using bt ≤ 2t and Lemma 7.7, in all cases, except when L = A6 = L2(9). Finally, if
L = A6 = L2(9), then d ≥ 6 and |Out(G)| < 2dt follows easily.

13. p-solvable composition factors and outer automorphism groups

The purpose of this section is to complete the proof of Theorem 1.5.
Fix a prime p. Throughout this section we put c to be 241/3 if p ≤ 3 and

(p − 1)!1/(p−2) if p ≥ 5.

The ﬁrst result concerns transitive permutation groups.

Theorem 13.1. Let G ⊳ A ≤ Sn be transitive permutation groups of degree n. Let
p be a prime. Then ap(G)|A/G| ≤ cn−1.
Proof. We prove the result by induction on n.

First let A be a primitive permutation group. If A contains An, then the bound

is clear. Otherwise we have |A| ≤ 24(n−1)/3 by [M].

Now let A be an imprimitive permutation group. Let {B1, . . . , Bt} be an A-
invariant partition of the underlying set on which A acts, with 1 < t < n. Let A1
denote the action of the stabilizer of Bi in A on Bi. Then A embeds in Ai≀St and G
permutes transitively the subgroups Ai. Let Gi denote the action of the stabilizer
of Bi in G on Bi. By Theorem 2.3 we have b(A/G) ≤ b(A/GK)b(A1/G1) where K
denotes the kernel of the action of A on {B1, . . . , Bt}.

In order to bound ap(G) we ﬁrst set s = |B1|, that is n = st. We have
ap(G) = ap(G/K ∩ G) · ap(K ∩ G) ≤ ap(GK/K) · ap(K ∩ G).

Let N be the kernel of the action of K on B1. We have

ap(K ∩ G) · a(K/(K ∩ G)) ≤ ap((K ∩ G)N ) · a(K/(K ∩ G)N ) =

= ap((K ∩ G)N/N ) · ap(N ) · a(K/(K ∩ G)N ) ≤ ap(G1) · a(A1/G1) · ap(N ).
We are now in position to bound ap(G) · |A/G| = ap(G) · a(A/G) · b(A/G). We

have
ap(G) · |A/G| ≤ ap(GK/K) · |A/GK| · ap(K ∩ G) · a(K/(K ∩ G)) · b(A1/G1) ≤

≤ (ap(GK/K) · |A/GK|) · (ap(G1) · |A1/G1|) · ap(N ).

By induction (noting that GK/K and G1 are transitive on {B1, . . . , Bt} and B1
respectively), we have ap(GK/K) · |A/GK| ≤ ct−1 and ap(G1) · |A1/G1| ≤ cs−1.

34

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

Moreover by repeated use of Proposition 6.1, we see that ap(N ) ≤ c(s−1)(t−1).
These give ap(G)|A/G| ≤ ct−1cs−1c(s−1)(t−1) = cn−1.

(cid:3)

We next need a lemma which depends on the existence of regular orbits under

certain coprime actions.
Lemma 13.2. Let A be a primitive linear subgroup of ΓLd(pf ) for a prime p and
integers f and d with d as small as possible. Put A0 = GLd(pf ) ∩ A. Let J0 be the
product of all normal subgroups of A contained in A0 which are nonsolvable, have
orders coprime to p, and are minimal with respect to being noncentral in A0. Then
either pf = 7, d = 4 or 5, and b(J0) = |PSp4(3)|, or b(J0) < pf d.
Proof. The group J0 is a central product of quasisimple groups J1, . . . , Jr for some
r. Since J0 ⊳ A and A is primitive, J0 acts homogeneously on the underlying vector
space. Let W be an irreducible J0-submodule. As in the proof of Theorem 4.1,
we may use [KL, Lemma 5.5.5, page 205 and Lemma 2.10.1, pages 47-48] to write
W in the form W1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Wr where for each i the Ji-module Wi (deﬁned over a
possibly larger ﬁeld) is irreducible.

Assume ﬁrst that r = 1.

If J0 has a regular orbit on W , then the result is
clear.
If J0 does not have a regular orbit on W , then [Sc, Theorem 7.2.a] says
that (J0, W ) is a permutation pair in the sense of [Sc, Example 5.1.a] or (J0, W )
is listed in the table on [Sc, Page 112].
In all these exceptional cases we have
|J0/Z(J0)| < |W| unless W is a 4 or 5 dimensional module over the ﬁeld of size 7
and J0/Z(J0) ∼= PSp4(3). Moreover |J0/Z(J0)| < pf d or |W| = pf d and one of the
previous exceptional cases holds.

Assume that r > 1. For each i we have b(Ji) < |Wi| or |Wi| = 74 or 75 and

b(Ji) < |Wi|1.31. From these it follows that b(J0) < |W| ≤ pf d.

(cid:3)

The next lemma may be viewed as a sharper version of Theorem 6.5 under the

assumption that p ≥ 7.
Lemma 13.3. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting faithfully and completely reducibly on
a ﬁnite vector space V in characteristic p. Then ap(G) ≤ |V |c1/c.
Proof. By Theorem 6.5, we may assume that p ≥ 5. By [HM, Theorem 1.1], the
strong base size of a p-solvable ﬁnite group S acting completely reducibly and
faithfully on a vector space of size n over a ﬁeld of characteristic p ≥ 5 is at
most 2. Thus |S| < n2/(p − 1). By the proof of Theorem 6.5 we then have
ap(G) ≤ |V |2/(p − 1) ≤ |V |c1/c.

(cid:3)

Theorem 13.1 is used in the proof of the following result which could be compared

with Theorem 6.5.
Theorem 13.4. Let G ⊳ A ≤ GL(V ) be linear groups acting irreducibly on a ﬁnite
vector space V of size n and characteristic p. Then ap(G)|A/G| ≤ 24−1/3nc1.
Proof. We prove the result by induction on n.

Assume that A acts primitively on V .

In fact, in our argument to show Theorem

1.1 we naturally took G to be as small as possible and our calculations actually
gave |A/(G ∩ Z(A)J)| < n apart from the eleven exceptions listed in Theorem 1.1
(when ap(G) = a(G)). Here, as usual, J denotes the central product of all normal
subgroups of A contained in A0 (where A0 = GLd(pf ) ∩ A and d is smallest with
A ≤ ΓLd(pf ) and n = pf ) subject to being noncentral. Thus we are ﬁnished if
the product of the orders of the nonabelian composition factors of J which are
p′-groups is at most 24−1/3nc1−1. Let J0 be as in Lemma 13.2. By Lemma 13.2 we
have b(J0) ≤ 24−1/3nc1−1 unless n ≤ 81 or pf = 7 and d = 4 or 5. It can be checked
by GAP [GAP] that the bound holds in case n ≤ 81. Thus assume that pf = 7 and
d = 4 or 5 with |b(J0)| = |PSp4(3)|. Then A is a 7′-group by [Sc, Theorem 7.2.a]
and so a7(G)|A/G| = |A| ≤ 24−1/3nc1 by [HM, Theorem 1.2].

Assume that A acts (irreducibly and) imprimitively on V . Let V = V1 ⊕···⊕ Vt
be a direct sum decomposition of the vector space V such that 1 < t and A (and
so G) acts transitively on the set {V1, . . . Vt}. Set m = |V1|. Let K be the kernel
of the action of A on {V1, . . . Vt} and let A1 and G1 be the action of NA(V1) and
NG(V1) on V1 respectively. As in the proof of Theorem 13.1, we have

ap(G) · |A/G| ≤ (ap(GK/K) · |A/GK|) · (ap(G1) · |A1/G1|) · ap(N ),

where, in this case, N denotes the kernel of the action of K on V1. Since the
groups GK/K ⊳ A/K can be viewed as transitive permutation groups acting on
t points, Theorem 13.1 gives ap(GK/K)|A/GK| ≤ ct−1. In the proof of Theorem
4.2 it was noted that G1 must act irreducibly on V1. Thus, by the induction
hypothesis, ap(G1)|A1/G1| ≤ 24−1/3mc1. Since N is subnormal in the irreducible
group A, it must be completely reducible. By repeated use of Lemma 13.3 we have
ap(N ) ≤ mc1(t−1)/ct−1. Applying these three estimates to the displayed inequality
above, we get ap(G)·|A/G| ≤ ct−1 · (24−1/3mc1)· (mc1(t−1)/ct−1) = 24−1/3nc1. (cid:3)
We are now in the position to complete the proof of Theorem 1.5 in the special

case that G is an aﬃne primitive permutation group.

Theorem 13.5. Let G be an aﬃne primitive permutation group of degree n, a
power of a prime p. Then ap(G)|Out(G)| ≤ 24−1/3n1+c1.
Proof. Let H be a point stabilizer in G. We may assume that H 6= 1. Clearly H
acts irreducibly and faithfully on a vector space V of size n. If H 1(H, V ) = 0, then
Theorem 13.4 gives the result, by Lemma 12.1. So assume that H 1(H, V ) 6= 0. By
Lemma 12.2, F ∗(H) = L1 × ··· × Lt where Li ∼= L are nonabelian simple groups
viewed as subgroups of GL(Vi) where the Vi are vector spaces with V = ⊕t
i=1Vi.
For each i put |Vi| = pd for a prime p and integer d. (See Lemma 12.2 and the
proof of Theorem 12.3.)

If n = q2 with q = 2e for an integer e > 1 and H = L2(q), then, by Section
12, a2(G)|Out(G)| < (n2 log n)/2 < 24−1/3n1+c1. Thus, by Theorem 12.3, we may
assume that |Out(G)| < n.

Assume ﬁrst that L is not p-solvable. By Lemma 7.8 and Proposition 6.1, we
have the estimate ap(H) ≤ (4d)tct−1 where c is as in the beginning of this section,
depending on p. For d = 2 and p ≥ 5, d = 3 and p ≥ 3, or d = 4 and p ≥ 3, or
d ≥ 5 we have (4d)tct−1 ≤ 24−1/3pdt(c1−1) giving the desired bound for ap(H) and
thus for ap(G)|Out(G)| in these cases. The only exceptions are d = 3 and p = 2,

36

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

and d = 4 and p = 2. However in these cases in the previous two estimates we may
replace 4d, we obtained from Lemma 7.8, by 1 and 4 respectively. Thus we may
assume that L is p-solvable (and p ≥ 3).

Let A be the full normalizer of G in Sn. Assume that p ≥ 5 and that A/G
is not p-solvable. By Schreier’s conjecture and the proof of Theorem 5.1 we must
then have t ≥ 8. By the proof of Lemma 13.3 we have ap(A) ≤ n3/4. Thus,
by the main result of [GH], Lemma 12.2 and Theorem 5.1, we have the estimate
ap(G)|Out(G)| ≤ (n3/4) · tlog t · pd/2. Furthermore, by the proof of Theorem 12.3,
we may also assume that d ≥ 3 as well as t ≥ 8. Under these conditions it easily
follows that (n3/4)· tlog t · pd/2 < 24−1/3n1+c1. Assume now that p ≥ 5 and A/G is
p-solvable. Then we must bound ap(A)|H 1(H, V )| ≤ (n3/4) · pd/2. Using Lemma
7.8 this is smaller than the desired estimate unless t ≤ 2. Using Lemma 13.2 we
can deduce the result if t ≤ 2 and d ≥ 4. By the proof of Theorem 12.3 we cannot
have d = 2 since H 1(H, V ) 6= 0 and p 6= 2. Thus t ≤ 2 and d = 3. We then have
by the proof of Lemma 13.3 that ap(A)|H 1(H, V )| ≤ (n3/(p − 1)) · p which is, for
n ≥ 343, less than 24−1/3n1+c1 . This forces p = 5, d = 3 and t = 1 with |L| not
divisible by 5. GAP [GAP] shows that there is no such possibility.

We are left to consider the case when p = 3 and L is 3-solvable, that is, a
Suzuki group. In this case F ∗(H) has a regular orbit on V by [Sc, Theorem 7.2.a].
We also have 1 < |H 1(H, V )| ≤ n1/14 by [H, Table 2] and so we may assume by
Lemma 12.2 that d ≥ 14. By these, Proposition 6.1 and a remark after Lemma
7.7, a3(A)|H 1(H, V )| < n3 < 24−1/3n1+c1 for n ≥ 314. We may thus assume that
a3(G)|Out(G)| > a3(A)|H 1(H, V )|. Then t ≥ 8 as in the previous paragraph and
so a3(G)|Out(G)| < n3 · tlog t · pd/14 < 24−1/3n1+c1 whenever n ≥ 38·14.

(cid:3)

Finally we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.5. By Theorem 13.5 we may assume
that G is a primitive permutation group of degree n with nonabelian socle E which
is isomorphic to a direct product of t copies of a nonabelian simple group L. By
Theorem 1.2 we know that |Out(G)| < n in this case and so it is suﬃcient to show
ap(G) ≤ 24−1/3nc1 for every prime divisor p of n. This follows from the proof of
Corollary 6.6.

14. On the central chief factors of a primitive group

In this section Theorem 1.6 is proved.

For a ﬁnite group X let c(X) denote the product of the orders of the central
chief factors in a chief series for X. By a generalization of the Jordan-H¨older
theorem, c(X) is independent from the choice of the chief series for X. Clearly,
c(X) ≤ c(X/N )c(N ) for any normal subgroup N of X. The following technical
lemma is not necessary but it makes our argument easier to understand.
Lemma 14.1. Let X = X1 ×···× Xt be the direct product of ﬁnite groups Xi. Let
Y be a subgroup of X such that Y projects onto every factor Xi. Then c(Y ) is at
most c(X) = Qt

i=1 c(Xi).

Proof. We prove the result by induction on t. In case t = 1 we have Y = X and the
result follows. Assume that t > 1. Write X in the form X1 × X′ where X′ is the

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

37

direct product of all but the ﬁrst factor of X. Let N be the kernel of the projection
of Y onto X1. Then N ⊳ Y and c(Y ) is equal to c(Y /N ) = c(X1) times the
product, denoted by cY (N ), of the orders of the central chief factors of Y which are
contained in N . Let Y ′ be the projection of Y into X′. Now N embeds naturally
in X′ and N ⊳ Y ′. Observe that a chief factor of Y contained in N is central in
Y if and only if it is central in Y ′. From this we get cY (N ) = cY ′ (N ) ≤ c(Y ′). By
our induction hypothesis, we get c(Y ′) ≤ c(X′) = Qt

i=2 c(Xi).

(cid:3)

Our ﬁrst result generalizes the fact that a nilpotent permutation group of degree

n has order at most 2n−1.
Theorem 14.2. For a permutation group G of ﬁnite degree n we have c(G) ≤ 2n−1.
Proof. Let G act on a set Ω of size n. We prove our bound using induction on n.
If G is a cyclic group generated by an n-cycle, then c(G) = n ≤ 2n−1. Assume
that G is a noncyclic primitive permutation group. Then the socle of G does not
contain any central chief factor of G.
If n = 3, 4, or 5, then inspection shows
that c(G) is at most 2, 3 and 4 in the respective cases. Otherwise if n ≥ 6, then
Corollary 6.6 gives c(G) ≤ 24−1/3nc1 < 2n−1.

Let G be an imprimitive transitive group acting on Ω. Let Σ be a system of
nontrivial, proper blocks each of size k and let K be the kernel of the action of G
on Σ. By Lemma 14.1 and induction, we have c(K) ≤ (2k−1)
. Thus, again by
induction, we get c(G) ≤ c(G/K)c(K) ≤ 2(n/k)−1 · 2n−(n/k) = 2n−1.

n/k

Finally suppose that G acts intransitively on Ω. Let ∆ be a G-orbit in Ω of size k.
Let K be the kernel of the action of G on ∆. By induction we have c(G/K) ≤ 2k−1
and c(K) ≤ 2n−k−1. Thus c(G) ≤ c(G/K)c(K) < 2n−1.

(cid:3)

In the next theorem c2 denotes the constant log9 32 which is close to 1.57732.

Theorem 14.3. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting faithfully and completely reducibly
on a ﬁnite vector space V . Then c(G) ≤ |V |c2/2.
Proof. Let us prove the result by induction on n = |V |.

Suppose that G acts irreducibly and primitively on V . First let G be a subgroup
of ΓL1(pf ) where n = pf for a prime p and integer f . Since pf − 1 < nc2/2, we
may assume that |G| > pf − 1. Set G0 = G ∩ GL1(pf ) < G.
If G0 contains a
cyclic (irreducible) subgroup of prime order q where q is a Zsigmondy prime, then
c(G) ≤ f ((pf − 1)/q) < pf − 1 < nc2/2 since such a cyclic subgroup cannot be
central in G > G0 and q ≥ f + 1. Otherwise Zsigmondy’s theorem implies that
f = 2 or pf = 26. In both of these cases we either have c(G) ≤ |G| < nc2/2 or
G = ΓL1(pf ) and c(G) = |G|. If G = ΓL1(p2), then |G| ≤ nc2/2 unless p = 2 or
3 when c(G) = 2 and 16 respectively, with our proposed bound being sharp in the
latter case. Thus we may assume that G = ΓL1(26). But in this case c(G) < |G|.
Let us continue to assume that G acts irreducibly and primitively on V . Let
us use the notation of Theorem 9.1 with B replaced with G. By the previous
paragraph we may assume that d > 1. By Theorem 9.1 we may also assume that
n ≤ 316. Let G0 be B0 in the notation of the proof of Theorem 9.1. Let J be

38

R. M. GURALNICK, A. MAR ´OTI, AND L. PYBER

the product of all normal subgroups of G contained in G0 which are minimal with
respect to not being contained in C.

Assume that J is a central product of quasisimple ﬁnite groups. Let pf = 2. By
the proof of Theorem 9.1 we may assume in this case that 16 ≤ d ≤ 25, and so that
J is the direct product of at most two quasisimple groups. Then c(G) is at most
a(G) ≤ 32d < 216 ≤ n. Let pf ≥ 3. Then d ≤ 16 and J is the central product of at
most three quasisimple groups. In this case c(G) ≤ a(G) ≤ 384f 4d(pf − 1). This is
less than pc2f d/2 unless d ≤ 7. Assume that d ≤ 7. If J is a central product of two
quasisimple groups, then, by Dickson’s theorem, a(G) ≤ 32f 3(pf − 1) < nc2/2, if J
acts on a vector space of dimension 4, and a(G) ≤ 96f 3(pf − 1) < nc2/2 if J acts
on a vector space of dimension 6. Assume that J is a single quasisimple group. If
d = 2, then Dickson’s theorem gives a(G) ≤ 2f 2(pf − 1) < nc2/2. If 3 ≤ d ≤ 7,
then a(G) ≤ 4f 2d(pf − 1) which is again smaller than nc2/2.

Assume that J is solvable. Then c(G) ≤ c(G/G0)c(G0/Z(G0))c(Z(G0)) which
is at most f (pf − 1)c(G0/Z(G0)). The group G0/Z(G0) is isomorphic to an aﬃne
linear group HW acting on a vector space of size |W| = d2 with W a completely
reducible H-module. By induction it is easy to see that c(HW ) ≤ |W|c2/2. Thus
c(G) ≤ f (pf − 1)(d2c2 /2) which is at most nc2/2.

Assume now that J = J1 ◦ J2 where J1 is a normal subgroup of G that is
a central product of quasisimple groups and J2 is a solvable noncentral normal
subgroup of G. Let d1 ≥ 2 and d2 ≥ 2 be the dimensions of the vector spaces
(over the ﬁeld of size pf ) on which J1 and J2 act naturally. So d1d2 | d. The
group G0/Z(G0) may be viewed in a natural way as a subgroup Y of a certain
direct product X1 × X2 such that Y projects onto both X1 and X2 where X1 was
treated two paragraphs up and X2 one paragraph up as G0/Z(G0), where it was
shown that f (pf − 1)c(Xi) ≤ pf dic2/2 for i = 1 and 2. By Lemma 14.1 we have
c(G) ≤ f (pf − 1)c(X1)c(X2) < pf dc2/2.

Assume that G acts irreducibly and imprimitively on V . Suppose G preserves a
direct sum decomposition V1⊕···⊕Vt of the vector space V with t > 1 maximal. Let
K be the kernel of the transitive permutation action of G on {V1, . . . , Vt}. Observe
that the action of K on every Vi is completely reducible since such a projection of
K can be viewed as a normal subgroup in the primitive action of NG(Vi). Thus by
Theorem 14.2, Lemma 14.1 and induction, we have

c(G) ≤ c(G/K)c(K) ≤ 2t−1 · |V1|c2t/2t = |V |c2/2.

Finally assume that G acts reducibly on V which may be considered as U ⊕ W
where U and W are nontrivial G-submodules of V . If K denotes the kernel of the
action of G on U , then G/K and K act faithfully and completely reducibly on U and
W respectively. By induction c(G) ≤ c(G/K)c(K) ≤ (|U|c2 /2)(|W|c2/2) < nc2/2.
This ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem.

We are now in the position to prove Theorem 1.6. By Theorem 14.3 we are
ﬁnished in case G is an aﬃne primitive permutation group. If G is not an aﬃne
primitive permutation group, then, as in the last two paragraphs of the previous
section, c(G) can be bounded using Theorem 14.2 and the two remarks that follow
Lemma 7.7. In both of these cases we get c(G) < n3/2/2.

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

15. Asymptotics

In this section the second half of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.3 are proved.

Let G be a primitive permutation group of degree n and let A be the full normal-
izer of G in Sn. Assume that A is not an (aﬃne) subgroup of AΓL1(q) for a prime
power q equal to n. We will show that for n ≥ 214000 we have |A/G| < n1/2 log n.
Assume ﬁrst that A is an aﬃne primitive permutation group. Then so is G. In
fact we may change notation and assume that A and G are linear groups acting
irreducibly on a ﬁnite vector space V of size n with G ⊳ A. First assume that A
acts primitively on V . Let us use the notation of Theorem 10.1. By assumption,
we have d ≥ 2. If d = 2 then, by the structure of A, we have that |A/G| is at
most (3/2)(√n − 1) log3 n < n1/2 log n if A is solvable and |A/G| < n1/2 log n if A
is nonsolvable (using Dickson’s theorem). If d ≥ 3, then, by Theorem 10.1,

|A/G| < n1/3 · (log n) · d2 log d+3 ≤ n1/3(log n)2 log log n+4 < n1/2

for n ≥ 28192.

Assume now that A acts imprimitively on V and that it preserves a direct sum
decomposition V1⊕···⊕Vt of V where t > 1 is as large as possible. Let K denote the
kernel of the (transitive) action of A on {V1, . . . , Vt}. As in the proof of Theorem
9.2, let A1 be the action of NA(V1) on V1. The group A1 acts primitively and
irreducibly on V1. By Theorem 9.1, we have a(A1) < m log m for m = |V1| > 316.
In the notation of Lemma 7.2 for t ≥ 2729 we have a(K/J) ≤ (a(X1))t/3c1 , by use of
Lemma 7.5, where c1 is as in Theorem 1.5. From this and by the proof of Theorem
9.2 together with part (2) of Lemma 10.3 and Theorem 1.7, for t ≥ 2729 we get

|A/G| ≤ |A/GK| · (a(A1)b(A1/G1))t/3c1 ≤ 16t/√log t · n1/3 < n1/2.

Otherwise, if t is bounded (is at most 2729) but t 6= 2, 4, then, again by the proof of
Theorem 9.2 and by Lemma 7.2 and Theorems 1.7 and 4.2, we have, for n ≥ 28192,
|A/G| ≤ |A/GK|·b(A1/G1)·(a(A1))3t/8 ≤ 16t/√log t·(log m)2 log log m·n7/16 < n1/2.
If t = 2 and m ≥ 22048, then |A/G| ≤ b(A1/G1)a(A1) < m log m < n1/2 log n.
Let t = 4. Then |A/G| ≤ 6 · b(A1/G1) · (a(A1))2. Using the notation d (for A1)
as in Theorem 10.1, by the argument above, we see that for d ≥ 2 and m ≥ 22048
we have b(A1/G1) · a(A1) < 16 · m1/2 log m. This gives |A/G| < n1/2 log n for
n ≥ 28192 under the assumption that d ≥ 2. Thus assume that d = 1. Here we
use the observation made in Lemma 7.3. Write a(A1) = |A1| in the form 2ℓr where
r is odd and ℓ is an integer. Then we have |A/G| ≤ 6 · 22ℓ · r. From this the
result follows if |A1| < 6m. Otherwise, by Zsigmondy’s theorem, 2ℓ < m. Now
|A1| < m logq m where q is the size of the ﬁeld over which A1 and A are deﬁned.
From this 22ℓ · r < m2 logq m giving |A/G| < n1/2 log n unless q = 2. If q = 2, then
2ℓ ≤ log m, and so |A/G| < 6 · m(log m)2 < n1/2 log n for m ≥ 22048.

Assume that A is a primitive permutation group which is not of aﬃne type.
In this case we use the notations, assumptions and the argument in the last two
If A has two minimal
paragraphs of Section 9. However, we use Theorem 1.7.

normal subgroups, then we have

|A/G| = a(A/G)b(A/G) < n1/3 · 4s/√log s · (log n)2 log log n < n1/2

for n ≥ 28192, if s 6= 1, and also when s = 1. Finally assume that A has a unique
minimal normal subgroup. We ﬁrst claim that we may assume that t ≥ 512. If
|Out(L)| ≤ √m and t ≤ 512, then |A/G| ≤ n1/4 · 16t/√log t < n1/2. If |Out(L)| is
larger than √m, then L is one of the exceptions in Lemma 7.7 and so t ≥ 512 by
use of n ≥ 214000. If t ≥ 512, then, for n ≥ 214000, we have

|A/G| ≤ |Out(L)|1/3t · 4t/√log t · tlog t < n1/2 log n.

This proves the second half of Theorem 1.1.
So far we showed Theorem 1.3 in case |Out(G)| = |A/G|. In fact by the same
calculation as in the previous paragraph we established Theorem 1.3 in case G is
not of aﬃne type. Thus assume that G is of aﬃne type and H 1(H, V ) 6= 0 where
V is the minimal normal subgroup of G and H 6= 1 is a point stabilizer in G. Let
us use the notation and assumptions of the proof of Theorem 12.3.

Let us ﬁrst assume that t > 1 and |Out(G)| ≤ (q − 1)q[d/2]|Out(L)|t/2bt with
d ≥ 2 where bt ≤ 4t/√log t · tlog t, by Theorem 1.7 and |Out(L)| ≤ 4(log n)/t, by
Lemma 7.8. Here n = qdt. Thus |Out(G)| < q[d/2]+1 · (4(log n)/t)t/2 · 4t/√log t · tlog t.
If d ≥ 3 or t ≥ 3, then this is less than n1/2 log n for n ≥ 214000. Finally, if d = 2
and t = 2, then |Out(G)| < n1/2 log n since |Out(L)| ≤ log n by use of Dickson’s
theorem on subgroups L of GL2(q).

Finally assume that in the proof of Theorem 12.3 we have t = 1, that is, H is
an almost simple group with socle L. Then |Out(G)| ≤ (q − 1)|H 1(L, W )||Out(L)|
where W is a nontrivial irreducible L-module of size dividing n and deﬁned over a
ﬁeld of size q. By Lemma 7.8, |Out(L)| ≤ 4 log n.

By the main result of [GH], we have |Out(G)| ≤ 4(q − 1)|W|1/2 log n. Assume
ﬁrst that |W| < n. If dim W ≥ 3, then |Out(G)| ≤ 4 · n5/12 log n, which is less
than n1/2 log n for n ≥ 214000. If dim W = 2, then |Out(G)| < n1/2|Out(L)| which
is less than n1/2 log n by using Dickson’s theorem once again. Thus assume that
|W| = n = qd. Furthermore, as observed in the proof of Theorem 12.3, we may
assume that d ≥ 3 (otherwise G is a member of the inﬁnite sequence of examples
in Theorem 1.2). Then, by [GH], it is easy to see that |Out(G)| < 2 · n3/4, at least
for n ≥ 214000. (In this previous bound the factor 2 comes from the fact that the
full normalizer in GL4(q) of A6 acting on the fully deleted permutation module of
dimension 4 in characteristic 3 over the ﬁeld of size q has size (q − 1)|S6| since the
dimension of the ﬁxed point space of a 3-cycle in A6 is diﬀerent from the dimension
of the ﬁxed point space of an element in A6 which is the product of two 3-cycles.)
This proves the ﬁrst statement of Theorem 1.3.

If L is an alternating group of degree at least 7, a sporadic simple group or the
Tits group, then dim(H 1(L, W )) ≤ (1/4) dim(W ) by [GK, Corollary 3] and [GH].
Thus in these cases we have |Out(G)| < 2· n1/2 ≤ n1/2 log n. If L is a simple group
of exceptional type, then dim(H 1(L, W )) ≤ (1/3) dim(W ) by [H], thus if d ≥ 7
then |Out(G)| < 4 · n3/7 log n < n1/2 log n for n ≥ 214000. Otherwise d = 6 and
L = G2(r) with r even or 4 ≤ d ≤ 6 and L is a Suzuki group (by [KL, Table 5.3.A]

NORMALIZERS OF PRIMITIVE GROUPS

41

and [KL, Table 5.4.C]). However in these cases dim(H 1(L, W )) ≤ 1, by [H], and so
|Out(G)| < n1/2 log n. We may now assume that L is a classical simple group.

Since we are assuming that the dimension of the natural module for L is at least
7, we see from [KL, Table 5.4.C] and [KL, Table 5.3.A] that d ≥ 7. By [H] we also
have dim(H 1(L, W )) ≤ (1/3) dim(W ). Thus |Out(G)| < 4 · n3/7 log n < n1/2 log n
for n ≥ 214000.

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.3.
