Abstract

We analyze BPS black hole attractors in 4d gauged supergravity in the presence of
higher derivative supersymmetric terms, including a Weyl-squared-type action, and de-
termine the resulting corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The near-horizon
geometry AdS2×S2 (or other Riemann surface) preserves half of the supercharges in N = 2
supergravity with Fayet-Iliopoulos gauging. We derive a relation between the entropy and
the black hole charges that suggests via AdS/CFT how subleading corrections contribute
to the supersymmetric index in the dual microscopic picture.

Depending on the model, the attractors are part of full black hole solutions with diﬀerent
asymptotics, such as Minkowski, AdS4, and hvLif4. We give explicit examples for each of
the asymptotic cases and comment on the implications. Among other results, we ﬁnd that
the Weyl-squared terms spoil the exact two-derivative relation to non-BPS asymptotically
ﬂat black holes in ungauged supergravity.

Although supersymmetric black holes in gauged 4d supergravity are in many respects very
similar to their siblings in ungauged supergravity, they have enjoyed considerable attention
only in recent years. The ﬁrst analytic examples were discovered in [1], elaborated in [2, 3]
and further generalized in various directions in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and references therein.
These solutions typically have either AdS4 asymptotics or a runaway vacuum that can
sometimes be seen as a meaningful solution when embedded in higher dimensions [10],
e.g. hyperscaling violating Lifshitz [11] (hvLif4) that uplifts to AdS5. The full black hole
solutions are quarter-BPS in N = 2 gauged supergravity, with an enhancement to four

1

supercharges (half-BPS) on the horizon. The horizon can in general have a topology of
any Riemann surface, such that the near-horizon geometry is AdS2 × Σ2
g with genus g ≥ 0.
The ﬁrst example of a microstate counting for these black holes was only achieved
recently in [12] building on results of [13, 14], where the case of spherical asymptotically
AdS4 black holes embeddable in 11d supergravity on S7 [15, 16] was considered. It turned
out that the leading macroscopic entropy in this case corresponds to the (partially) twisted
index of ABJM theory on S1×S2. A similar understanding of the leading black hole entropy
also exists for the class of asymptotically hvLif4 black holes discussed in [10], as they can be
understood from a dimensional reduction of asymptotically AdS5×S5 geometries in string
theory and therefore described by a (twisted) compactiﬁcation of N = 4 SYM [17].

It was further shown in [18] that some special gaugings in N = 2 supergravity lead to
a vanishing scalar potential with a non-BPS Minkowski vacuum, where the near-horizon
geometry is nevertheless half-BPS and falls in the same class of supersymmetric solutions.
It was proven that these solutions are equivalent (at the two derivative level) to the non-
BPS black holes in ungauged supergravity [18], therefore suggesting an interesting new
string theory point of view [19].

In this work we initiate a study of how higher order derivative terms in the supergrav-
ity lagrangian aﬀect the near-horizon geometry AdS2 × Σ2
g, similar in spirit to the work
of [20] in 5d gauged supergravity. Building on previous work [21] in oﬀ-shell conformal
supergravity1, we evaluate the corrections to the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
from a four-derivative lagrangian containing the Weyl-squared term. This allows to address
several diﬀerent questions about the above summarized black holes with diﬀerent asymp-
totics. We mostly focus on the case of spherical horizon, Σ2
g=0 = S2, but also comment on
the resulting diﬀerences when considering a higher genus Riemann surface Σ2
g>0 instead.
We use the conformal oﬀ-shell formalism [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] and give general results
about the attractors for all types of higher order derivatives, since our BPS conditions are
oﬀ-shell. This makes the resulting conditions immediately applicable to the supergravity
localization techniques that are being developed in recent years (see e.g. [30, 31, 32] and ref-
erences therein). The explicit entropy corrections can however be only determined once we
choose a particular lagrangian via the formalism of Wald, and we consider a four-derivative
supersymmetric lagrangian that includes the C2-term, (with C the Weyl tensor) obtained in
[33]. We give several explicit examples of models with diﬀerent asymptotics that we solve
completely and obtain some very generic results. We do not relate these results directly
with string theory, keeping our higher derivative corrections general within the framework
of 4d supergravity and not restricted to ones coming from string compactiﬁcations.

Concretely, our main result is deriving a relation between the entropy S, the central

where the exact deﬁnitions and derivation are presented in the main body of the paper.
The above equation generalizes the main two-derivative attractor equation, presented ﬁrst
in [2], with higher-derivative corrections entering through the quantities Z and FA (see also
[34]). This relation proved to be of particular importance from a microscopic point of view
[12] as it suggests how the Witten index of the dual ﬁeld theory relates to the entropy.

Let us brieﬂy discuss some other interesting results from simple examples with diﬀerent
asymptotics. We leave the considerable amount of technical details behind them for the
following sections.

• Minkowski

For the case with Minkowski asymptotics we consider the so-called T3-model with
prepotential2

F =

(X 1)3
X 0 + c ˆA

X 1
X 0 ,

and the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) gauging parameters ξ1 = 0, ξ0 6= 0. At two-derivative
level (c = 0) the BPS attractor solution of this model with nonvanishing charges p0
and q1 was shown to be equivalent with the non-BPS attractor of ungauged super-
gravity. This is due to the vanishing scalar potential, which guarantees that the radii
of AdS2 and S2 are equal so that the Ricci scalar vanishes. However, in the gauged
model we are considering, we ﬁnd the following exact ratio between the two radii
with higher derivative corrections (c 6= 0)

R2
S 2

AdS2

= 1 +

192 c
p0 q1

.

(1.2)

This shows that the two radii are no longer equal, even though asymptotically we
again ﬁnd a Minkowski vacuum. Therefore we conclude that at the level of Weyl-
squared supergravity the apparent equivalence between the half-BPS attractor in
gauged supergravity and the non-BPS attractor in ungauged supergravity breaks
down. Note however that in a more restricted setting where higher order corrections
are directly dictated by string theory one might again ﬁnd the same equivalence, e.g.
in this example if there exists a stringy argument that sets c = 0 or string theory
dictates adding other higher derivative lagrangians, c.f. [29, 35].

2Here ˆA indicates the lowest component of the Weyl-squared chiral multiplet, that generates the higher

derivative invariant. See more in the following sections and appendix A.

• hvLif4

Here we again consider the T3-model as above,

F =

(X 1)3
X 0 + c ˆA

X 1
X 0 ,

but with the orthogonal choice for FI parameters, ξ0 = 0, ξ1 6= 0. We also choose
the orthogonal nonvanishing charges q0 and p1 and note that this model is fully
upliftable (for arbitrary value c parametrizing the higher derivative corrections) to
5d gauged supergravity with higher derivative terms. An exact match with 5d results
[20] cannot be pursued because our lagrangian is only a subclass of the reduced 5d
lagrangian, so we leave the comparison for the future. Here we make the following
interesting observation. In the two-derivative case (c = 0) the T3 model with the hvLif
asymptotics allows only for higher genus black holes, i.e. the near-horizon geometry
has an H2 factor or its quotients. This is because T3 model is only a restriction from
the general STU model, which instead allows for horizon topologies of all Riemann
surfaces. The situation changes completely when we switch on the higher derivative
correction, as we ﬁnd horizon solutions with all possible topologies for suitable values
of c even in the T3 model. This signiﬁes the appearance of the so-called small
black holes, i.e. black holes of vanishing classical area and corresponding Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy that develop a horizon only due to the higher derivative terms. It
would be interesting to relate these to the dual description with twisted N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory [17, 10].

• AdS4

The AdS4 asymptotics are instead reached in the so-called “magnetic” T3 model with
prepotential

F =qX 0(X 1)3 + c ˆA X 0 X 1 ,

where all FI terms are nonvanishing, ξ0 6= 0, ξ1 6= 0, or with the more general STU
prepotential in the same magnetic frame. In the c = 0 case the N = 2 two-derivative
model can be embedded in maximal 4d gauged supergravity and then to full 11d
supergravity on S7. We are unfortunately not aware of any results about the higher
derivative lagrangians coming from 11d, therefore our c 6= 0 model is not known to
have a string theory origin. It is nevertheless interesting to look at the Wald entropy,
which takes the general form from (1.1) and with a suitable gauge ﬁxing choice (see
more in section 4.4 or appendix C of [12]) can be further simpliﬁed to

S = −

π
2

Im (R + 256 FA) .

(1.3)

In the two-derivative case (when FA = 0 and higher derivative corrections inside the
deﬁnition of R vanish), the quantity R corresponds directly to the microscopic result

4

for the Witten index [12]. We hope that in future the corrected result above will
be also readily comparable with the dual ﬁeld theory index evaluated with ﬁnite N
corrections.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give more details about
the general conformal supergravity formalism and set up our main conventions. In section
3 we look particularly at the BPS properties of the near-horizon geometry and simplify
the supersymmetry equations to algebraic ones, keeping everything general for any super-
symmetric lagrangian. In section 4 we specify the F-term lagrangian that we want to work
with, discuss the gauge-ﬁxing procedure to on-shell supergravity, and derive the resulting
Wald entropy formula. We then formulate the attractor equations in terms of the physical
black hole charges as deﬁned from the Maxwell equations, and show how these reproduce
exactly the known two-derivative results. Finally, in section 5 we take particular mod-
els with diﬀerent asymptotics and solve explicitly the attractor equations, evaluating the
corresponding Wald entropy for each case. We leave some technical details on conformal
supergravity for appendix A.

2 Conformal supergravity formalism

Dealing with higher-derivative supergravity is vastly simpliﬁed by making use of an oﬀ-shell
formulation, as the algebra of the various symmetries is ﬁxed, irrespectively of the terms
present in the lagrangian. In this paper, we use the formalism of superconformal calculus
in order to construct and analyse actions containing terms with four derivatives. In this
extended setting, all symmetries are local and act linearly on the various ﬁelds, while the
Poincare version of the theory can be obtained by gauge ﬁxing the additional symmetries
and gauge connections.

µ), dilatations (bµ), chiral symmetry (Vµ

The superconformal algebra includes general-coordinate, local Lorentz, dilatation, spe-
cial conformal, chiral SU(2) and U(1) transformations in the bosonic sector. Its fermionic
sector contains the generators of supersymmetry (Q) and special supersymmetry (S) trans-
formations, which square to general-coordinate and special conformal transformations, re-
spectively. The gauge ﬁelds associated with general-coordinate transformations (the viel-
bein ea
µ) are real-
ized by independent ﬁelds. The remaining gauge ﬁelds of Lorentz (ωab
µ ), special conformal
(f a
µ) are composite ﬁelds. The corresponding
curvatures and covariant ﬁelds are contained in a tensor chiral multiplet, with 24 + 24
oﬀ-shell degrees of freedom; in addition to the independent superconformal gauge ﬁelds
it contains three auxiliary ﬁelds: a Majorana spinor doublet χi, a scalar D and an anti-
ij (where i, j, . . . are chiral SU(2) spinor indices). For notational

simplicity from now on we indicate this auxiliary SU(2) singlets by their SU(2) invariant
combinations, i.e. T −
ij εij and T +
ab = Tab ij εij. We refer to the Appendix A and [26]
for a detailed description of the theory.

ab = Tab

In order for the theory to be gauge-equivalent to the Poincare theory, we need to
consider additional matter degrees of freedom, the so-called compensating multiplets. The
on-shell theory then arises upon solving the equations of motion for the auxiliary ﬁelds, T ±
ab,
χi, D and choosing convenient values for the compensating multiplets in order to gauge ﬁx
the dilatation, SU(2), U(1) and S-supersymmetry transformations. We will make use of a
compensating hypermultiplet, whose scalar ﬁelds transform under the SU(2) R-symmetry,
and a compensating vector multiplet, which contains a complex scalar ﬁeld with a nonzero
U(1) R-symmetry charge. In the on-shell theory, only the gauge ﬁeld in the compensating
multiplet remains, as the graviphoton, while all other bosonic ﬁelds in the compensating
multiplets are either frozen by gauge choices or set to zero by the equations of motion of
the auxiliary ﬁelds.

While this procedure can be carried out explicitly for the two-derivative theory, it
becomes rather cumbersome for higher-derivative theories, especially since the equations
of motion for auxiliary ﬁelds are no longer algebraic. However, one need not follow a gauge
ﬁxing procedure but instead simply work in the conformal setting, since any physical results
must be invariant under the extra symmetries. This is the point of view we take in most
of this paper, while convenient gauge choices are used only to make a comparison with
the microscopic results in section 4.4. An additional advantage of this approach is that
the BPS conditions we obtain apply to any oﬀ-shell Lagrangian, beyond the particular
four-derivative examples discussed here.

We will consider the case of a single hypermultiplet and an arbitrary number of vec-
tor multiplets, so that the on-shell theory contains no hypermultiplets and an arbitrary
number of vector multiplets. Since we are focused on abelian Fayet-Iliopoulos gauged su-
pergravity, this represents the generic situation. We will not consider any explicit higher-
derivative terms for the matter ﬁelds, but we will allow for the presence of an arbitrary
chiral background superﬁeld [36], so that the vector multiplet couplings are controlled by a
prepotential, F (X, ˆA), that depends holomorphically on the vector multiplet scalars, X I,
and the lowest component scalar ﬁeld of the chiral multiplet, ˆA, and is homogeneous of
degree two, as

X IFI + 2 ˆA FA = 2 F .

(2.1)

Here, FI and FA are the derivatives of the prepotential with respect to the X I and ˆA, which
have conformal weights 1 and 2 respectively, so that F (X, ˆA) has weight 2. Eventually
the chiral multiplet corresponding to ˆA will be identiﬁed with a composite chiral multiplet
describing the covariant objects of the supergravity multiplet, in order to generate (some)

6

R2-terms in the action, but much of our analysis will not depend on this identiﬁcation. In
fact, the BPS conditions derived in this section are valid for any collection of vector and
chiral multiplets, but we ﬁnd it convenient to use the function (2.1) in order to write the
results in a form that can be used directly in the Lagrangian we will choose in the next
section.

Our main strategy in this section is to obtain S-invariant BPS conditions, which are
valid without choosing any particular gauge for the additional symmetries. We discuss this
in some detail in the simple setting of hypermultiplets, deﬁning the relevant linear com-
binations of fermions giving rise to the S-invariant BPS conditions. In the remaining two
subsections we apply the same procedure to the vector multiplets and the Weyl multiplet.

2.1 Hypermultiplets

The ﬁeld content of the hypermultiplets is 4 real scalars, described by the section of an
i , and 2 fermions ζ α, where the indices α, β . . . =
Sp(nH) × Sp(1) bundle, denoted by Aα
1, . . . , 2 nH for nH hypermultiplets. One can deﬁne a covariantly constant hermitian tensor
Gα ¯β (which is used in raising and lowering indices) and of a covariantly constant skew-
symmetric tensor Ωαβ (and its complex conjugate ¯Ω¯α ¯β satisfying Ω¯α¯γ ¯Ω ¯β¯γ = δ ¯α
¯β). These
α, through the constraint
can be used to deﬁne the pseudo-reality condition on the section Ai

εij ¯Ω¯α ¯βG ¯βγAj

γ = Ai ¯α ≡ (Ai

α)∗ ,

(2.2)

where εij is the antisymmetric symbol for the SU(2) indices. Furthermore, one can deﬁne
the hyper-K¨ahler potential,

χH = 1

2 εij ¯ΩαβAi

β ,

(2.3)

which characterises the geometry of the target space.

The supersymmetry variations for hypermultiplets read

(2.4)

where the spinors ǫi, ηi stand for the Q- and S- supersymmetry parameters respectively.
Note that we have included a coupling to vector multiplets, through a gauging described
by the constants, ξI, and an anti-hermitian generator tα
β. This is reﬂected in the co-
variant derivative, Dµ, which contains covariantization with respect to all superconformal
symmetries and the gauge symmetries of Ai

(2.5)

Here, the W I
µ are gauge ﬁelds belonging to vector multiplets with scalar components given
by the X I, for I, J · · · = 1, . . . , nv. The constants ξI are the so-called Fayet-Iliopoulos
(FI) gauging parameters appearing in standard literature. We suppress the gauge coupling
constant g, noting that one needs to send all parameters ξI to zero to get back to the
ungauged case.

Inspired by the structure of (2.3) one can deﬁne a spinor that transforms into a constant

under S-supersymmetry, as

(2.6)

(2.7)

so that it may be used as a compensating spinor in the construction of S-invariant combina-
tions. Here, we suppress the terms proportional to fermion ﬁelds, as they are not relevant
for deriving BPS conditions for bosonic ﬁelds. The moment maps, µI ij, are deﬁned as

µI ij = χ−1

α ¯Ωαβtβ

γAj

H ξI (cid:0)Ai

γ(cid:1) ,

ij ≡ (µI ij)∗ = εikεjlµI kl ,

(2.8)

where the pseudo-reality condition can be shown using the properties listed in [25], for
instance. Similarly, the vectors kµ and kµ
j are deﬁned as the singlet and triplet in the
decomposition of the scale-invariant combination

while the explicit form of the triplet, ki

(2.11)

This ﬁnal form of the variation can be used to derive BPS conditions, given a particular
ansatz for the geometry and the amount of supersymmetry. Assuming full supersymmetry,
all terms are linearly independent and must therefore vanish separately, leading to the
classiﬁcation of [21]. Alternatively, one may assume a particular spacetime ansatz and
derive the possible BPS classes of solutions allowed by (2.11) and the analogous conditions
arising from other multiplets [21].

8

In the next section we will consider a 1/2-BPS ansatz for AdS2×S2, in the presence of
a single (compensating) hypermultiplet, so that one can set n = 1 above and the indices α,
β = 1, 2. It follows that we can take ¯Ωαβ to be the corresponding antisymmetric symbol for
these indices and that the generator tα
β ∈U(1) as a subgroup of SU(2). We assume these
restrictions for the remainder of the paper, noting that the decomposition (2.11) does not
rely on this simpliﬁcation.

2.2 Vector multiplets

The ﬁeld content of a vector multiplet is a complex scalar, X, an SU(2) doublet of fermions,
Ωi, a gauge ﬁeld, Wµ, described by its ﬁeld strength, Fµν, and an SU(2) triplet of auxiliary
scalars, Yij. We will consider an arbitrary number, nv, of vector multiplets, labelled by an
index I, J · · · = 1, . . . , nv. The Q- and S-supersymmetry transformations for the vector
multiplet take the form,

δX = ¯ǫiΩi ,
2εij ˆFµνγµνǫj + Yijǫj + 2Xηi ,
δΩi = 2 /DXǫi + 1
δAµ = εij¯ǫi(γµΩj + 2 ψµjX) + εij¯ǫi(γµΩj + 2 ψµ
δYij = 2 ¯ǫ(i /DΩj) + 2 εikεjl ¯ǫ(k /DΩl) ,

j ¯X) ,

where ψµ

j stands for the gravitini and we use the convenient shorthand

ˆFµν = F −

µν − 1

¯X T −

(2.12)

(2.13)

which appears frequently below.

A vector multiplet is a special case of a scalar chiral multiplet, which is the most general
multiplet depending on half of the spinorial variables in superspace. Chiral multiplets are
characterised by the conformal weight, w, of their lowest component, a complex scalar, A,
generalising the vector multiplet scalar, for which w = 1. The higher components include
two doublets of spinors, Ψi, Λi, an anti-selfdual tensor, G−
ab, a complex SU(2) triplet of
scalars, Bij, and an additional complex scalar, C, with the supersymmetry transformations
of the ﬁrst components given by

δA = ¯ǫiΨi ,
δΨi = 2 /DAǫi + Bij ǫj + 1

2 γabG−

ab εijǫj + 2 wA ηi .

(2.14)

Since we will be using only a particular composite chiral multiplet, made out of the Weyl
multiplet, we need not consider the conditions arising from independent chiral multiplets,
as they will be automatically satisﬁed once the BPS conditions for the Weyl multiplet are

9

imposed. However, the variations in (2.14) will be useful below, since the coupling of the
vector multiplets is controlled by the prepotential F (X I, ˆA) in (2.1). While the use of
a particular function related to the couplings in the Lagrangian we intent to use is not
necessary at this point, it is very convenient for later developments, so we consider the
dependence on the chiral background through ˆA already in this section.

We thus proceed to deﬁne the function

where we used (2.10). This is the ﬁnal form for the supersymmetry variations, without
imposing any restrictions on the spinor parameters. Note that the variables eK/2X I and
eKχH are scale invariant, so that they represent natural variables to be used in physical
quantities.

2.3 The Weyl multiplet

The covariant ﬁelds of the Weyl multiplet comprise the ﬁeld strengths for the various
gauge ﬁelds and the auxiliary ﬁelds of the multiplet. In the fermionic sector, this amounts

10

i = − 3

to the ﬁeld strength of the gravitino, R(Q)i
ab, the corresponding ﬁeld strength for the S-
supersymmetry gauge ﬁeld φµ and the auxiliary spinor χi.
In view of the conventional
2 γνχi, both φµ and χi are given in terms of the gravitino, so
constraint, γµR(Q)µν
that one only need consider BPS conditions arising from variations of its ﬁeld strength,
R(Q)i
ab. In addition, the derivative of at least one covariant fermion must be considered,
in order to ensure that the variations of all derivatives of fermionic ﬁelds vanish [37]. This
imposes a constraint on the ﬁelds of the Weyl multiplet, irrespectively of the type of fermion
chosen, so we take it to be the derivative of the compensating fermion, ζ H
i, for simplicity.
We now give the Q-variations of the relevant S-invariant combinations one can built
i, deﬁned in (2.6). The

(2.22)

Note the presence of a bare K-boost gauge ﬁeld, f a

inhomogeneous S-supersymmetry transformation of the compensating fermion in (2.7). It
follows that (2.22) is a constraint on the ﬁelds of the Weyl multiplet, ensuring the vanishing
of all fermionic derivatives.

3 Attractor ansatz and supersymmetry

In this section we consider the conditions arising from supersymmetry, assumming a 1/2-
BPS condition. We focus on systems containing a single, compensating, hypermultiplet

11

and an arbitrary number of vector multiplets, allowing for an abelian gauging of the hy-
permultiplet using the vector ﬁelds in the vector multiplets.

In order to proceed, we adopt a particular projection for the Killing spinor preserved
by the background, which breaks the SU(2) R-symmetry invariance down to a U(1). In
particular, we choose the supersymmetry parameter to be such that

γ23ǫi = i σ i

3 j ǫj ,

(3.1)

where σ3 stands for the third Pauli matrix. One can straightforwardly replace this by any
element of the SU(2) algebra, but we restrict to this choice for simplicity, without loss of
generality.

Note that a 1/2-BPS Killing spinor need not satisfy a projection of the type (3.1) in
general. However, in the case of a single gauged hypermultiplet, the constant SU(2) element
parametrising the gauging must be compatible with the properties of the spinor, as will
be seen below. Conversely, it has been shown that (3.1) is the only possible condition
on a spinor, assuming an AdS2×S2 background [21]. These are the backgrounds we are
interested in, so we will adopt this choice henceforth. This choice for the Killing spinor
projection is eventually equivalent to choosing the matrix tα
β controlling the gauging in
(2.8) to be

tβ

γ ∼ σ3

γ , ⇒ µI ij = i ξI εik σ3

j ,

(3.2)

as will be explained in details shortly. This identity is not immediately needed here in
the oﬀ-shell context but the reader familiar with Poincare supergravity will recognize more
easily the physical FI parameters ξI appearing this way.

3.1 BPS conditions on the scalars

It is important to note that (3.1) only allows to reduce terms involving exactly two gamma
matrices, so that terms appearing in the various spinor variations can be meaningfully
separated in those containing even and odd numbers of gamma matrices. It then follows
that each group of terms must vanish separately.

We therefore ﬁrst consider the terms with an odd number of gamma matrices in (2.11)
and (2.18)-(2.19), setting to zero the terms transforming in diﬀerent SU(2) representations.
We thus ﬁnd the conditions

H Ai

α(cid:17) = 0 ,
Dµ(cid:16)χ−1/2
Dµ(cid:0)eK/2X I(cid:1) = 0 ,
Dµ(cid:0)e−Kχ−1
H (cid:1) = Aµ = kµ

intergrability conditions on these equations, explicitly

jAj

α − ξI tα

βAi

β F I

µν = 0 ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

Since the ﬁeld strength of the U(1) R-symmetry gauge ﬁeld vanishes, Aµ is locally vanishing
everywhere, so it drops out of all covariant derivatives. Consequently, we solve (3.3) and
(3.6) by imposing that the corresponding gauge ﬁelds satisfy the condition

1

2 Vµi

j = µI ikεkjW I
µ ,

(3.8)

and that the rescaled section χ−1/2

H Ai

α is constant, as is µI ij.

The above results imply that one can do convenient gauge choices for some of the
superconformal symmetries, in order to simplify the following discussion. Note that all
conditions (3.3)-(3.5) involve derivatives of scale invariant combinations, so that the space-
time dependence of all scalar ﬁelds can be restricted to a single function, which can be
taken to be e−K. Using a conformal transformation, we can set this function to a constant,
thus reducing all scalar ﬁelds in the hyper- and vector multiplets to constants. Note that
this still leaves a residual rigid conformal symmetry, which is unphysical and must therefore
drop out from all physical quantities. With this gauge choice, we obtain that kµ, deﬁned in
(2.10) vanishes, so that setting to zero the terms with an odd number of gamma matrices
in (2.20), leads to the condition

Dµ(χ−1/2

H

T −
ab) = 0 .

(3.9)

This establishes that a covariantly constant anti-selfdual tensor can be deﬁned on the
background.

Additionally, we can make a similar gauge choice for the hypermultiplet sections ex-
ploiting the SU(2) gauge symmetry. For a general situation involving many hypermultiplets
this is not possible, but in this paper we are interested in the case of a single hypermul-
tiplet, whose degrees of freedom can be gauged away to obtain an on-shell theory. For a
single hypermultiplet, we can use an SU(2) rotation to ﬁx the constant χ−1/2

α as

H Ai

H Ai

α = δα
i

,

(3.10)

which can be used to identify the indices α, β · · · = 1, 2 with the SU(2) indices i, j . . . . We
can then write ¯Ωij = εij and rewrite (2.8) as

µij,I = ξIεiktk

j ,

(3.11)

which will be used in the rest of this paper to translate the gauging µij,I to the FI terms. As
will be seen in subsection 3.3, the generator ti
j by consistency.

j will be identiﬁed with i σ3i

3.2 Bosonic background

We are looking for static spherical black hole attractor geometries with constant scalars as
shown above, and introduce the following notation for the AdS2×S2 metric3:
r2 (cid:17) + v2(cid:16)dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2(cid:17) ,

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = v1(cid:16) − r2 dt2 +

so that the four-dimensional Ricci scalar equals R = 2(v−1

tangent-space indices above, where a, b, . . . label the ﬂat AdS2 indices (0, 1) associated with
(t, r), and ˆa, ˆb, . . . label the ﬂat S2 indices (2, 3) associated with (θ, ϕ). The non-vanishing

We refer to the appendix for the general deﬁnitions of these quantities, which appear in the
superconformal transformation rules of the Weyl multiplet ﬁelds and are therefore needed
below.

3It is straightforward to generalize our results to toroidal and higher genus horizons, but for most of
the discussion here and later in the paper we look at the spherical case. We come back to general horizon
topologies in 3.4 and in some of the explicit examples we show at the end.

3.3 Solving the BPS equations

Proceeding with solving the BPS conditions, we start with (2.18) and (2.19), where the
ﬁrst line of each has already been analysed in subsection 3.1. The second lines in each
of (2.18) and (2.19) are even in the gamma matrices, so we need to use the projection
(3.1) in order to obtain conditions on the ﬁelds. Given spherical symmetry, we can assume
that only the (0, 1) and (2, 3) components of the ﬁeld strengths are non-zero. Under this
assumption, the condition from (2.18) takes the form

2 iεij(cid:16) ˆF I −

23 − X IF −

23(cid:17)σ j

ij − X I Yij(cid:1) δj

is not an independent constraint.

(3.24)

The former condition simply identiﬁes the spinor projection in (3.1) with the generator
controlling the abelian gauging of the compensating hypermultiplet. We remind the reader
that the choice for σ3 is conventional and that the projection may be deﬁned using any
SU(2) generator. Our analysis then shows that this SU(2) generator must be identiﬁed
with the (also arbitrary) generator appearing in the gauging. The second of (3.24) is a
nontrivial condition on the ﬁeld strengths that will turn out to correspond to a Dirac
quantisation condition.

3.4 Final set of oﬀ-shell equations

Summarizing, we are left with the following set of equations for the half-BPS near-horizon
geometry of consideration,

where we used (3.11) to derive the second and third relation from (3.22) and in the last
identity we used (3.24) and the deﬁnition for the magnetic charges,

F I

23 =

pI
v2

.

(3.26)

Note the appearance of the quantity κ in the last equation, which should just be equal
to 1 if we follow the above derivation. In fact κ is related to the sign of the curvature of
the horizon topology, and since so far we only looked at a spherical horizon we trivially
ﬁnd κS 2 = 1. If we instead look at a higher genus Riemann surface, we ﬁnd κT 2 = 0, and
g = −1 for g > 1. This is the only way the BPS attractor equations change with the
κΣ2
change of horizon topology, as already remarked in various papers [1, 2, 8, 9].

The last equation we write is obtained by combining (3.17) and (3.18)

2 iεij ˆF I −

23 σ j

ik − 4 X I ¯X J µJ ik = 0 ,

(3.27)

from which we will deﬁne the magnetic charges, once we plug in the equation of motion
for the auxiliary ﬁelds Y I
ij.

16

The above equations are valid always for any choice of oﬀ-shell lagrangian, and need
to be supplemented by the explicit equations of motion for the ﬁelds D and Y , together
with the Maxwell equations and Bianchi identities. Thus a complete solution can only be
obtained after a choice of an explicit lagrangian, to which we proceed in the next section.

C2 (F-term) action

The two derivative actions of vectors and hypers coupled to N = 2 conformal supergravity
are given in [23, 24] and further generalized to four derivatives years after in [21, 25].
The full four-derivative F-term theory for vector and hypermultiplets coupled to conformal
supergravity, with vanishing fermions, is given by:

The components of the composite chiral multiplet made out of covariant quantities of the
Weyl multiplet, denoted by hats, are still to be substituted to ﬁnd the fully explicit result.
We only require the modiﬁed homogeneity property

X IFI + 2 ˆAFA = 2 F .

We stress again that the way to recover the lagrangian of ungauged supergravity is by

putting all FI parameters ξI to zero.

We additionally need to solve the equations of motion for Y I

ij and D. First let us

consider the e.o.m. of Y , which reads:

(4.1)

(4.2)

NIJY J

ij − i(cid:16)FAI ˆBij − εilεjk ˆBlk ¯FAI(cid:17) − 2 χHµijI = 0 ⇒

Y I

where NIJ = −i(FIJ − ¯FIJ ) and N IJ is its inverse. This ﬁxes Y in terms of the gaugings
in the two-derivative case when FAI = 0. On the other hand, for the same Lagrangian the

17

4.1 Standard gauge ﬁxing

If we concentrate on the two-derivative part of the lagrangian for the moment, we can
perform the gauge ﬁxing and match all our equations to the existing ones in the on-shell
literature so that we can later compare and see how the higher derivatives change the
results. From (4.2) in the two derivative case we ﬁnd:

Y I
ij = 2N IJ χH µij J ,

(4.4)

which would eventually lead to the usual on-shell supergravity scalar potential upon sub-
stitution in the lagrangian. The D equation of motion imposes that

and choosing the gauge ﬁxing condition

χH = −2 e−K ,

χH = −2 ,

(4.5)

(4.6)

leads to the standard Poincare supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. The FI gauging
can now be interpreted as nontrivial charges for the gravitino, once (3.8) is used. Even if
the higher derivative corrections change the e.o.m. for Y we could consistently keep the
same gauge ﬁxing procedure and stick to (4.6) if needed.

4.2 Wald entropy

To evaluate the entropy of a space-time conﬁguration, one uses Wald’s formula for a generic
theory of gravity, which formally reads:

S =

1

4Z d2ΩEabcd εabεcd

(4.7)

where, in our case, d2Ω = v2 sin θ dθ dφ, εab is the binormal tensor, normalized to εab εab =
−2 and has only (0, 1) components, perpendicular to the surface spanned by dθ and dφ.
So we can take locally ε01 = −ε10 = 1. The normalization is in principle not ﬁxed by the
Noether procedure but can be easily derived by the requirement of ﬁnding the Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy with the correct prefactor, see below. Finally, Eabcd is the equation of
motion for the Riemann tensor as if it were an independent ﬁeld, and it reads:

Eabcd = − 1

Now, plugging in the values for the near-horizon ﬁeld conﬁguration we ﬁnd

Note that the normalization we chose is in agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
formula. In fact, at the two derivative level the above formula simpliﬁes completely since
the second row vanishes and χH = −2e−K from the (4.3), such that

S =

1

4Z e−K v2 sin θ dθ dφ =

A
4G4

,

(4.10)

since e−K is just the four-dimensional Newton constant in this case (c.f. (4.1)). Observe
that neither the horizon area nor the Newton constant are gauge invariant quantities in
conformal supergravity by themselves, but the entropy is (as needed for a physical quan-
tity). Thus gauge ﬁxing is not needed here. Using the equation of motion for D, we can
further rewrite (4.9) as

S =

1

4Z d2Ωhe−K − 16 (cid:0)|w|2 − 8

3R + 16 D(cid:1) ImFAi .

(4.11)

Note that the above formula holds for both the gauged and the ungauged solutions since
we did not yet plug in any BPS conditions and gaugings terms do not enter. Now, upon
using the expressions for the Ricci scalar and the BPS conditions in the gauged theory,
(3.25), we obtain

1

S =

4 Z d2Ωhe−K + 64 v−1
⇒ S = πe−K v2 + 64 π

ImFAi

ImFA .

(4.12)

Instead for the ungauged, fully BPS, attractor with R2 interactions, one ﬁnds R = D =

0 and v1 = v2 = 16|w|−2, so that the entropy formula (4.11) leads to

S = πe−K v2 − 256 π ImFA .

This is not the limit v2 = v1 of the result for the gauged case, as one might expect, since
D is negative deﬁnite for the gauged theory and cannot be continuously put to zero.

4.3 Attractor equations

The attractor equations are given by (3.27), by using the equation of motion (4.2) for Y I
ij,
together with the near-horizon value for the ﬁeld ˆBij (see (B.9)). They read:

Let us obtain the dual vector ﬁelds, deﬁned as

We can deﬁne electric and magnetic charges in a general way by integrating the real

part of the gauge ﬁeld strengths and their duals, as

Γ ≡ pI

qI! =ZS 2 F I

GI! = v2   F − I

23 + F + I
23
23 I + G+

23 I! ,

G−

(4.18)

which will be used in the following. The corresponding imaginary part is identiﬁed with
the timelike components of the ﬁeld strengths and reads

23

23 I! = Re  ¯w X I

¯w FI! + χH   0

(4.19)

which is of exactly the same form as for the two derivative theory. Note however that the
prepotential F and χH do carry information about the higher derivative corrections.

The attractor equations can be written using the deﬁnition for the charges and the

explicit expressions for the gauge ﬁeld strengths. The result is

Γ ≡ pI

qI! = 2ΩM(F )

−ReF (ImF )−1

(4.21)

using the matrix FIJ .

Using the above, we can compute a number of useful relations. Starting from the
expressions for the ﬁeld strengths, we can relate their inner product to the central charge,
deﬁned as

The result reads

Z ≡ eK/2(FIpI − X IqI) .

and can be used to rewrite the equation of motion for the scalar ﬁeld D, (4.3), as

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

Finally, by direct computation using the expression for the charges, one can ﬁnd the

following expression for the central charge

Z

i eK/2ξIX I = χH v2 + 256 i FA IX I

which can be rewritten as

− 1024 i FA I N IJ(cid:0)v2 χH ξJ − 256 Im(X KξK FAJ )(cid:1) X LξL ,

upon use of the attractor equations.

(4.25)

(4.26)

If we now use the deﬁnition

(4.27)
as introduced in [2], in the two-derivative case when χH = −2 e−K (and clearly FA = FAI =
0) we ﬁnd

L ≡ eK/2ξIX I ,

we instead ﬁnd the following useful relation

4.4 Relation to microscopic index

Note that there is another possibility for the gauge ﬁxing condition, which is less standard
in literature and diﬀers from the one described in 4.1. It was shown to be particularly useful
when relating the gravity and the ﬁeld theory side via the AdS/CFT correspondence, and
amounts to choosing

ξI X I = 1 ,

(4.30)

or any other arbitrary real constant without any further loss of generality. This means
that L = eK/2 and then one looks at the much simpler expression

R ≡

Z
L

= FIpI − X IqI .

(4.31)

The upshot now is that the quantity R turns out to be functionally equivalent to the
Witten index of the dual ﬁeld theory, as explained in [12].
It is therefore tempting to
speculate that our higher derivative corrections to the relation between the Wald entropy
and the quantity R provide the corresponding change in the Witten index of the dual ﬁeld
theory with ﬁnite N corrections. We therefore deﬁne a new quantity

RA ≡ FIpI − X IqI + 256 FA ,

(4.32)

that knows about the higher derivative corrections to the entropy in the gauge (4.30),

S = −

5 Examples with diﬀerent asymptotics

Here we consider several simple models to illustrate explicitly the formalism above. We
choose three models with diﬀerent asymptotics, which are well-known and understood in
the two-derivative theory. Note that the addition of higher derivative terms in principle
changes not only the near-horizon solution, but also the asymptotics. One then needs to
be careful about the existence of the asymptotic space, which is sometimes guaranteed by
supersymmetry.

However for the higher derivative lagrangian that we consider even non-supersymmetric
vacua of the two-derivative theory are guaranteed to remain intact in the four-derivative
theory. Asymptotically we can show that the cosmological constant does not change, for
the following reason. The scalar potential in the lagrangian (4.1) arises after substituting
the auxiliary ﬁeld Y with its equation of motion, (4.2). Notice there that the terms
distinguishing the two-derivative and the four-derivative case depend linearly on the ﬁeld
ˆBij. From (B.9) we see that ˆBij is proportional to the curvature of the SU(2) gauge ﬁeld

22

j. On a maximally symmetric vacuum (and also depending on the case for other less
Vµi
symmetric vacua) vectors are constrained to vanish for symmetry reasons, and therefore
one immediately ﬁnds the same value of scalar potential as in the two-derivative case since
ˆBij = 0. Thus Minkowski4 and AdS4 remain asymptotic vacua automatically, and the
same is true for many other vacua of interest such as the hvLif4 that we also consider in
one of the examples below4.

5.1 Minkowski

Let us consider the so called T3 prepotential

with the choice of FI parameters

F =

(X 1)3
X 0 + c ˆA

X 1
X 0 ,

ξ0 6= 0 ,

ξ1 = 0 .

(5.1)

(5.2)

The two-derivative case is recovered when the parameter c is taken to zero. In this case
one ﬁnds a supersymmetric near-horizon geometry and a supersymmetry breaking ﬂat
space asymptotically, since the scalar potential identically vanishes. These black holes
were shown to coincide with the more standard extremal non-BPS black holes in ungauged
supergravity [18].

We will further make the simplifying assumption that we look at axion-free solutions,

and adopt the notation

X 1
X 0 = i t , (t ∈ R) ,

Re(cid:16) X 1
X 0(cid:17) = 0 ⇒
ˆA
(X 0)2 = −4 w2

(X 0)2 = −s , (s ∈ R) .

We ﬁrst ﬁnd from (3.25)

together with

X 0 = 16 i ξ0 ,

v−1

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

These can be directly plugged in the attractor equations (4.20) to ﬁnd the following set of
higher derivative equations:

p1 = q0 = 0 ,

4This is because even if hvLif4 is not maximally symmetric, it is the reduction of the maximally

symmetric AdS5 [10].

(5.7)

(5.8)

where we used the condition 2ξ0p0 = 1 (in the asymptotically Minkowski case we can
only have spherical horizons, therefore no other choice of κ is possible in (3.25)). The last
equation we need to determine the complete solution is the equation of motion for the ﬁeld
D, (4.3). It is instructive ﬁrst to look only at the two-derivative case when ˆc = 0. In this
case we simply ﬁnd

which immediately leads to

χH = −2e−K = 16t3|X 0|2 ,

v−1
1 = 16ξ2

0|X 0|2 = v−1

.

(5.9)

(5.10)

Note that the radii are not physical parameters as they depend on the arbitrary factor |X 0|.
They are thus not gauge invariant, as we already remarked in section 4.2. Nevertheless,
the above solution leads us to the gauge invariant conclusion that

v2
v1

= 1 ,

(5.11)

as expected from the precise agreement of these black hole attractors with the ones in
ungauged supergravity [18]. Now let us consider how the higher derivative corrections
change the equation of motion for the ﬁeld D that ultimately tells us the relation between
χH and |X 0|2 and determines the ratio between the two radii. The general case of (4.3)
when ˆc 6= 0 leads to the following solution for χH:
(t2 − ˆc ξ2

χH = 16 |X 0|2

It is now easy to see the diﬀerence between gauged (ξ0 6= 0) and ungauged (ξ0 = 0)
supergravity. In the two derivative case both lead to the same attractor solution, while the
higher deivative case when ˆc 6= 0 we get diverging results. In ungauged supergravity the
ratio v1/v2 must always be 1 as the Ricci scalar must vanish. This is no longer the case in
gauged supergravity, even though asymptotically we still have a Minkowski vacuum. This
suggests that from a full quantum gravity point of view the two-derivative equivalence
is only a coincidence. Note however that in a more restricted setting where higher order
corrections are directly dictated by string theory one might again ﬁnd the same equivalence,
possibly on a case by case basis.

Finally, for completeness we give the full entropy in terms of the electromagnetic

charges, which now reads

Our next example makes use of the same prepotential

F =

X 0 + c ˆA

X 1
X 0 ,

but an orthogonal choice of FI parameters

ξ0 = 0 ,

ξ1 6= 0 .

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

In the two-derivative case of c = 0 the black holes solutions were analyzed carefully [10] and
were shown to originate from dimensional reduction of AdS5 black strings. The 4d solutions
therefore exhibit a runaway behavior, with an asymptotic solution called hyperscaling-
violating Lifshitz, or hvLif. The full solution in this case is quarter-supersymmetric.
Note that in the STU prepotential the asymptotically hvLif black holes can have hori-
zon topologies of any Riemann surface, but for the simpliﬁed T3 prepotential considered
above there are only hyperbolic (i.e. higher genus) solutions at a two-derivative level. How-
ever as we will soon see the higher derivative terms change the situation and so we consider
ξIpI = ξ1p1 = κ/2 for any κ = {−1, 0, 1}.

Considering the c 6= 0 case, we again take the axion-free assumption, and use the

parametrizations

X 1
X 0 = i t , (t ∈ R) ,

Re(cid:16) X 1
X 0(cid:17) = 0 ⇒
ˆA
(X 0)2 = −4 w2

(X 0)2 = −s , (s ∈ R) .

(5.17)

together with

X 0 = −16 t ξ1 .

where we again used ˆc ≡ 256c. We see that p0 = q1 = 0 as expected from the two-
derivative axionless case [10]. Further using the equation of motion for the D ﬁeld, (4.3),
we eventually ﬁnd

which reproduces the two-derivative result that v2 = 3v1 for κ = −1. In the two-derivative
limit ˆc = 0 it is clear that any other choice for κ is inconsistent, but this is no longer the
case if ˆc 6= 0 is in some favorable parameter range. For κ = 0, i.e. toroidal horizon, it is
enough that ˆc > 0 and we ﬁnd the so called small black holes, with a vanishing classical
horizon that appears after higher derivative corrections. For the spherical horizon with
κ = 1 instead we ﬁnd the condition for the appearance of horizon is ˆc > ξ−2
1 , which is more
restrictive and subject to possible change from even higher derivative corrections, but still
a valid possibility.

Let us ﬁnally see how the entropy gets corrected in the higher genus case κ = −1
(in the toroidal and spherical cases the entropy is proportional to ˆc as it has no classical
contribution),

S = 2√3 πpq0p1q(p1)2 + 1

4 ˆc .

(5.23)

It would be interesting to see how this formula compares with higher derivative corrections
to horizons in ﬁve-dimensional supergravity [20] and then relate the microscopic descrip-
tions [17, 10]. We leave this for the future as one should in principle ﬁrst repeat our exercise
for all possible four-derivative terms in 4d gauged supergravity.

26

5.3 AdS

In the last example we consider asymptotically AdS4 models, the simplest of which has the
prepotential

F = −2 iqX0 X 3

1 + c ˆA X0 X1 ∼ −2 iqX0 X 3

1 − i c ˆArX0

X1

,

(5.24)

with two non-vanishing FI parameters which we already choose equal for simplicity

ξ0 = ξ1 =

1
2

,

(5.25)

so that the charge quantization condition is simply p0 + p1 = κ.
In the two derivative
case (c = 0) this is a truncation of the STU model that arises from reduction of 11
dimensional supergravity on S7. The full black hole solutions in such theories were ﬁrst
found in [1] and further worked out in [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Their dual microscopic description
was uncovered in [12] with the successful match to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. It
is therefore interesting to look at higher derivative corrections to such solutions which
might lead to new tests of AdS/CFT and further insight into quantum gravity. Note
however that the particular higher derivative corrections do not immediately follow from
11d supergravity, so the model is purely exemplary. We hope to come back to more direct
applications of higher derivative corrections from string theory in the future.

Focusing on the explicit model, we again look at the case of axion-free solutions, which

means

X 1
X 0 = t2 ,

for a real scalar t. As before we also have

ˆA
(X 0)2 = −4 w2

(X 0)2 = −s ,

leading to

We now ﬁnd from (3.25)

χH +

ˆc t
v2

= 2 t|X 0|2(cid:2)8 t2 − ˆc(1 + t2)2(cid:1)(cid:3) .

simply given by

and

v2 =

p0

χH (1 − t2)

=

after plugging in the condition p0 + p1 = κ. We then ﬁnd

v2
v1

= p0 (1 + t2)2
(1 − t2)

,

which we require for consistency to be a positive number. This sets the required ranges for
the magnetic charge p0 for the diﬀerent choices of horizon topology, κ = {−1, 0, 1}. Finally
the entropy is given by

S =

2 π p0 (−t)3
(1 − t2)

,

(5.36)

in terms of the scalar t given above, (5.33).

The higher derivative equations in this case unfortunately look more complicated than

in the previous examples,

By working to ﬁrst order in ˆc in all the equations, one ﬁnds the modiﬁcation to the two

the higher order equations are always solvable in principle to any precision needed.

A Superconformal calculus

Throughout this paper, space-time indices are denoted by µ, ν, . . . and Lorentz indices are

conventions, so that the anti-symmetric symbol εabcd is imaginary, with ε0123 = −i. We
therefore deﬁne (anti-)selfdual tensors as complex conjugates of each other, by
