We study the nonlinear responses of relativistic chiral matter to the external ﬁelds, such as the
electric ﬁeld E, gradients of temperature and chemical potential, ∇T and ∇µ. Using the kinetic
theory with Berry curvature corrections under the relaxation time approximation, we compute the
transport coeﬃcients of possible new electric currents that are forbidden in usual chirally symmetric
matter, but are allowed in chirally asymmetric matter by parity. In particular, we ﬁnd a new type
of electric current proportional to ∇µ × E due to the interplay between the eﬀects of the Berry
curvature and collisions. We also derive an analogue of the “Wiedemann-Franz” law speciﬁc for
anomalous nonlinear transport in relativistic chiral matter.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Transport phenomena are abundant in our everyday
life and are important in wide areas of physics from
condensed matter physics and nuclear physics to astro-
physics. A familiar example is the Ohm’s law, je = σE,
where the electric current ﬂows in the direction of the
external electric ﬁeld E. In addition to such ﬁrst-order
transport, various kinds of second-order transport phe-
nomena have already been revealed in the 19th century.
The well-known examples are the Hall eﬀect and Nernst
eﬀect, je = σEBE × B and je = σT B(−∇T )× B, respec-
tively, where B is the magnetic ﬁeld and T is tempera-
ture. One can question whether other second order trans-
port phenomena are possible. For example, one might
imagine the electric current of the form je = σEµ∇µ × E
with µ the chemical potential. However, such a current
is not consistent with parity and is usually forbidden in
a system that respects parity.

In this paper, we argue that such exotic transport phe-
nomena become possible in relativistic matter with chi-
rality imbalance (which we shall simply refer to as chiral
matter below) where parity is explicitly violated. Exam-
ples of chiral matter are the electroweak plasma in the
early Universe [1], quark-gluon plasmas created in heavy
ion collisions [2, 3], electromagnetic plasmas in neutron
stars [4, 5], neutrino matter in supernovae [6], and a new
type of materials called the Weyl semimetals [7–9].
In

∗ Aﬃliation until March 2015

this paper, we explicitly compute the transport coeﬃ-
cients of these nonlinear anomalous transport in chiral
matter at low temperature, based on the kinetic theory
with Berry curvature corrections [10–15] under the relax-
ation time approximation.

We show that the nonlinear anomalous transport above
arises from the interplay between the Berry curvature
and collisions. We also derive a universal relation inde-
pendent of the relaxation time, which is similar to the
Wiedemann-Franz law in usual metals, but is speciﬁc
for nonlinear anomalous transport in chiral matter. Our
main results are summarized in Eqs. (18) and (24).

In this paper, we set c = kB = 1 unless stated other-

wise, but keep e and  explicitly.

II. CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENTS FROM

SYMMETRIES

We ﬁrst classify the possible electric currents in the
presence of various external ﬁelds to the second order in
derivatives. Although we limit ourselves to the electric
currents in this paper, the same classiﬁcation is also ap-
plicable to heat currents. The external ﬁelds we consider
here are the electric ﬁeld E, magnetic ﬁeld B, gradi-
ents of temperature and chemical potential ∇T and ∇µ,
and their possible combinations. (In this paper, we do
not consider external ﬁelds involving the ﬂuid velocity v,
such as the vorticity ω = ∇ × v.) We also assume ex-
ternal ﬁelds are time-independent. We will see that the
P (parity), C (charge conjugation), and T (time rever-
sal) symmetries put stringent constraints on the possible

transport phenomena.

III. KINETIC THEORY

2

Let us ﬁrst consider the electric currents in usual
parity-invariant systems. To the second order deriva-
tives, the general expression that is consistent with CPT
symmetries reads j+ = j(1)

+ + j(2)

+ , where

j(1)
+ = σEE + σT (−∇T ) + σµ(−∇µ),
j(2)
+ = σEBE × B + σT B(−∇T ) × B

+ σµB(−∇µ) × B.

(1)

(2)

Here and henceforth the subscript ± denotes the P-even
and P-odd transport coeﬃcients. The upper indices de-
note the number of derivatives.

Note that the transport coeﬃcients in Eq. (1) are T -
odd and must be accompanied with dissipation: under T ,
j → −j, E → E, and B → −B. On the other hand, the
transport coeﬃcients in Eq. (2) are T -even and do not
necessarily involve dissipation (see also Ref. [16]). For
the electric current, the σE term is called the Ohm’s law,
the σT term the Seebeck eﬀect, the σEB term the Hall
eﬀect, and the σT B term the Nernst eﬀect.

Let us turn to a parity-violating system with nonzero
chiral chemical potential, µ5 = (µR − µL)/2. Under P,
the chiral chemical potential transforms as µ5 → −µ5.
Then one can write down the general expression for the
parity-odd current to the second order. For simplicity, we
ﬁrst consider the system only with right-handed fermions
at ﬁnite chemical potential µR (which we shall denote
µ in the following). Then the current is expressed by
j− = j(1)

− + j(2)

− , where

j(1)
− = σBB,
j(2)
− = σET E × (−∇T ) + σEµE × (−∇µ)

+ σT µ(−∇T ) × (−∇µ),

(3)

(4)

where all the transport coeﬃcients in Eqs. (3) and (4) are
functions of µ. The σB term is called the chiral magnetic
eﬀect [3, 17–20]. Note that the transport coeﬃcient σB
(which is referred to as the chiral magnetic conductivity)
in Eq. (3) is T -even and is indeed dissipationless (see be-
low) while those in Eq. (4) are T -odd and are dissipative.
It has been revealed that the coeﬃcient σB is uniquely
ﬁxed from the constraint of the second law of thermody-
namics and that it is related to the coeﬃcient of the chiral
anomaly [21]; its relation to the chiral anomaly also un-
derlies that this current is dissipationless. However, it is a
nontrivial question whether other parity-violating terms
in Eq. (4) are ﬁxed uniquely by the anomaly coeﬃcients.
We shall show that these new transport phenomena arise
due to an interplay between the topological terms (the
Berry curvature) and collisional terms.

We will be interested in the nonlinear electric currents
that arise due to the explicit violation of parity symmetry
in the system, shown in Eq. (4). As there is no such a
current involving the magnetic ﬁeld B there, it will be
suﬃcient to consider the case only with E, ∇T , and ∇µ,
but without B for this purpose.

A. Kinetic theory with Berry curvature

We ﬁrst brieﬂy review the kinetic theory for a single
chiral fermion at µ ≫ T [10–15]. (We will consider a sys-
tem with both right and left-handed fermions later.) The
chiral fermions near the Fermi surface possess a Berry
curvature in momentum space [10, 22]. The equations of
motion for chiral quasiparticles in an electric ﬁeld E and
the Berry curvature Ω

p are [23]

˙x = v + ˙p × Ω

p,

˙p = eE,

(5)

(6)

where v = ∂ǫp/∂p. Substituting them into the Boltz-
mann equation for the distribution function np(x),

∂np

∂np

(8)

where Icoll{np} is the collision term.

B. Relaxation time approximation

For the collision term in Eq. (8), we use the relaxation

time approximation,

Icoll = −

δnp

τ

,

(9)

where τ is the relaxation time (which we assume to be a
constant) and δnp = np − n(0)
p is the deviation from the
equilibrium distribution function.

For inhomogeneous temperature T and chemical po-
tential µ, the stationary solution of the kinetic equation

can be found order by order in derivatives,

They can be respectively computed by substituting

results read

.

Here n(0)
p is the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution and
the upper indices k = 0, 1, 2 denote the terms involving
k derivatives. Precisely speaking, there are other terms
not listed in δn(2)
p which are not related to the Berry
curvature corrections. However, they are irrelevant for
our purpose of computing the parity-violating transport
coeﬃcient to the second order and we will ignore them
below.

We pause here to remark on the relaxation time ap-
proximation in Eq. (9). Performing the momentum inte-
gral of the kinetic equation (8), one obtains the continuity
equation as long as the following condition is fulﬁlled:

(11)

One can check that the collision term in Eq. (9) together
with Eq. (10) indeed satisﬁes this condition, at least for
a spherically symmetric Fermi sphere; so the relaxation
time approximation in the present case is consistent with
the particle number conservation law.

IV. NONLINEAR ELECTRIC CURRENTS

A. System with a single chiral fermion

To simplify the argument, we ﬁrst consider the case
with a single chiral fermion. The electric current in the
presence of the Berry curvature corrections is given by

(14c)

Summing over the three contributions above, we obtain

σEµ = ±

(15)

for right and left-handed fermions, respectively.

Note here that two contributions of the form ∇T ×∇µ
with the opposite signs exactly cancel out in j3, and the
electric current proportional to ∇T × ∇µ is absent, at
least within the present relaxation time approximation
(although it is in principle allowed by the symmetry).
We also ﬁnd that the electric current proportional to
∇T × E disappears after the momentum integral.1 At
this moment, we do not have a clear understanding of
the physical reason that underlies their absence.

As a comparison, let us also compute the electrical
conductivity in relativistic matter. Under the relaxation
time approximation, we obtain the Ohmic current from
Eqs. (10) and (12) as

Using the number density for a single chiral fermion, n =
µ3/(6π23), the electrical conductivity can be expressed
as

σE =

ne2τ

µ

.

(17)

This takes the familiar form of the Drude-type formula
if we identify the eﬀective mass m∗ = µ.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (12) is the usual convective cur-
rent, the second term is the anomalous Hall current,
and the third term is the magnetization current [24] that
originates from the magnetic moment of chiral fermions
[13, 15].

The electric current to the second order in derivatives

1 Precisely speaking, the result of the momentum integral can be
diﬀerent in Weyl metals in condensed matte systems, where the

description of chiral fermions has ﬁnite UV and IR energy cutoﬀs.
In this case, σT E can remain nonzero at ﬁnite temperature, but
is suppressed exponentially as σET ∝ e−µ/T . In particular, σET
vanishes at T = 0.

By taking the ratio between Eqs. (15) and (17), we ob-
tain the analogue of the “Wiedemann-Franz law” speciﬁc
for relativistic chiral matter:

(18)

where we restored c. Equation (18) shows that the ra-
tio between the electrical conductivity σE and anomalous
nonlinear conductivity σEµ (multiplied by µ2 to match
the dimension) is a universal quantity that depends only
on the physical constants  and c. At least within the
present relaxation time approximation, this relation is in-
dependent of the microscopic details (i.e., the relaxation
time τ ).

It should be remarked that, in the case of usual metals,
the Wiedemann-Franz-type law for the ratio between the
linear and nonlinear transport coeﬃcients of electric cur-
rents do not exist. This may be understood as follows:
since all the nonlinear transport σEB, σT B, and σµB in
Eq. (2) are T -even, the transport coeﬃcients are even
functions of τ . Hence, the ratios between these nonlin-
ear transport coeﬃcients and the electrical conductivity
σE ∝ τ must depend on τ (i.e., nonuniversal). In chiral
matter, on the other hand, the nonlinear transport σEµ
is T -odd and σEµ/σE can be independent of τ .

where the thermal relaxation time τ is assumed to be
the same constant for right and left-handed fermions
[11, 25].2 Taking the summation and subtraction of the
contributions from right and left-handed fermions, we
then obtain the nonlinear anomalous electric and axial
currents,

respectively. On the other hand, one ﬁnds that the
Ohmic current in this case is

(23)

Denoting the transport coeﬃcients in Eqs. (21) and
(23) by σEµ5 and σE, respectively, we arrive at the
Wiedemann-Franz-type law in this case as

fermions

So far we have considered the case with a single chiral
fermion. We now consider a system with right and left-
handed fermions in the presence of ﬁnite chiral chemical
potential µ5 = (µR −µL)/2. We denote the vector chemi-
cal potential by µ = (µR +µL)/2. In this case, the kinetic
equation (8) needs to be extended to include both right
and left-handed fermions as (see also Refs. [11, 25])

former mean free time (which we denote τtr) is much
larger than the latter (which we denote τ ) [11, 25] and
we ignore the eﬀects of the former in the leading order in
τ /τtr ≪ 1. Then the kinetic equations for right and left-
handed fermions are decoupled from each other. Anal-
ogously to the discussion above, we use the relaxation

In this paper, we explored nonlinear responses of chi-
ral matter to external ﬁelds, based on the kinetic theory
with Berry curvature corrections. The exotic transport
phenomena found in this paper should be relevant to the
dynamical evolution of chiral matter, such as the elec-
troweak plasma in the early Universe, quark-gluon plas-
mas created in heavy ion collisions, and supernova explo-
sions. Our predictions may also be tested experimentally
in Weyl semimatals.

In this paper, we derived the analogue of

the
“Wiedemann-Franz” law for anomalous transport, as
shown in Eqs. (18) and (24). To what extent this rela-
tion is universal (i.e., independent of microscopic details
of systems) beyond the relaxation time approximation
would be an important question to be investigated in fu-
ture.

2 The assumption that τ is the same for right and left-handed
fermions should be approximately valid, at least in the regime

µ5 ≪ µ.

It would be interesting to study possible new nonlinear
heat currents speciﬁc for chiral matter, similar to the
nonlinear anomalous electric currents found in this paper.
One should be able to compute such heat currents by

n is the particle number current
and T µν is the energy-momentum tensor including the
Berry curvature corrections deﬁned in Ref. [13]. One can
also ask the possible eﬀects of ﬁnite fermion mass (see,
e.g., Ref. [26]). We defer these questions to future work.
