ABSTRACT

Context. The grand-design face-on spiral galaxy NGC 6946 is remarkable because of its high star formation activity, the
massive northern spiral arm, and the magnetic arms, which are observed in polarized radio synchrotron emission and
are located between the optical arms and possibly are magnetic reconnection regions.
Aims. We used electron densities and temperatures in star-forming (active) and less active regions and compared them
to ﬁndings from the analysis of the radio data to study the energy budget of NGC 6946. The hot gas above the magnetic
arms between the optical arms might suggest gas heating by reconnection. We also study the population of point sources
in NGC 6946, including the origin of the puzzling ultra-luminous emission complex MF16.
Methods. X-ray observations of NGC 6946 performed with XMM-Newton were used to study the emission from X-
ray point sources and diﬀuse hot gas, including the magnetic arms and the halo. Spectral ﬁtting of the diﬀuse X-ray
emission allowed us to derive temperatures of the hot gas. With assumptions about the emission volume, this allowed
us to estimate gas densities, masses, and cooling times.
Results. To explain the X-ray emission from the spiral arms of NGC 6946 two-temperature plasma models are needed
to account for the disk and halo emission. The interarm regions show only one thermal component. We observe that
the temperature of the hot gas in and above the magnetic arm regions increases slightly when compared to the average
temperatures in the areas in and above the spiral arms. For the southwestern part of the disk, which is depolarized in
the radio range by Faraday rotation, we ﬁnd more eﬃcient mixing of disk and halo gas.
Conclusions. We propose magnetic reconnection in the magnetic arm regions of NGC 6946 as the possible cause of
the additional heating of the gas and ordering of the magnetic ﬁelds. In the southwestern part of the galactic disk
we observed indications of a possible faster outﬂow of the hot gas. A very hot gas within the MF 16 nebula possibly
suggests shock heating by a supernova explosion.

1. Introduction

Table 1. Basic astronomical properties of NGC 6946

NGC 6946 (see Table 1) is a Scd spiral galaxy seen face-on,
which is listed in Arp’s atlas of peculiar galaxies because of
its massive northern spiral arm. Its large optical diameter
and low inclination make NGC 6946 one of the most promi-
nent grand-design spiral galaxies in the sky. It is known to
host a bright starburst nucleus (see e.g. Telesco & Harper
1980). Detections of CO radio emission lines (Nieten et al.
1999; Walsh et al. 2002) gave further evidence for the high
star-forming activity of NGC 6946 (especially in the north-
ern spiral arm), proved that molecular clouds containing
warm and dense gas are distributed throughout the inner
disk, and showed that the total molecular gas mass is ex-
ceptionally high for a spiral galaxy. The distributions of the
emission from NGC 6946 in various spectral ranges were
analysed with wavelet functions (see Frick et al. 2000).

1.1. Previous radio continuum ﬁndings

NGC 6946 has been thoroughly studied in the radio regime
in total and polarized emission (Beck 1991; Ehle & Beck
1993). Radio polarization observations at 18 cm and 20 cm
wavelengths revealed excess Faraday rotation and strong
depolarization in the SW quadrant of NGC 6946 that is

probably due to a large-scale magnetic ﬁeld along the line
of sight, oriented approximately perpendicular to the disk
plane (Beck 1991). Analysis of polarization data at four fre-
quencies also suggested strong vertical ﬁelds extending far
above the disk (Beck 2007). Such ﬁeld lines should enable
an outﬂow of hot gas into a halo. As the SW quadrant of
NGC 6946 is a region of relatively low star-formation activ-
ity, this phenomenon resembles a coronal hole on the Sun.
The average energy density of the warm ionized medium
in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the inner disk of
NGC 6946 was found to be lower by a factor of about 10
than the energy densities of the magnetic ﬁeld and that of
the cosmic rays, resulting in the conclusion that the mag-
netic ﬁeld dominates thermal processes in the disk and halos
of galaxies (Beck 2004). A signiﬁcant fraction of the diﬀuse
ISM must be unstable, giving rise to gas outﬂows.

Radio polarization data at λ6 cm led to the discovery
of a new phenomenon: highly aligned magnetic ﬁelds that
are concentrated in two main spiral features, located al-
most precisely between the optical spiral arms of NGC 6946
(Beck & Hoernes 1996, their Fig. 1). No enhanced densi-
ties of molecular, neutral, or warm ionized gas have been
detected at the positions of these magnetic arms. However,
radio observations revealed signiﬁcant Faraday rotation in
these regions so that some ionized gas must be present.
Frick et al. (2000) analysed the magnetic and optical spiral
arms in NGC 6946 using 1D wavelet transformations and
found that each magnetic arm is similar to the preceding
optical arm and hence can be regarded as a phase-shifted
image.

Rudimentary magnetic arms were also found in other
spiral galaxies (Beck 2015), but NGC 6946 still is the most
prominent example.

The magnetic arms contradict density-wave models,
which predict enhanced ordered magnetic ﬁelds at the in-
ner edges of the arms. Several mechanisms were proposed
to explain the magnetic arms. For example, the continuous
injection and ampliﬁcation of turbulent ﬁelds by supernova
shock fronts may suppress the mean-ﬁeld dynamo in the
material arms (Moss et al. 2013, 2015). Alternatively, the
introduction of a relaxation time of the magnetic response
in the dynamo equation may lead to a phase shift between
the material and magnetic spiral arms (Chamandy et al.
2013a,b). The mean-ﬁeld dynamo in the material arms
might also be suppressed by outﬂows driven by star for-
mation (Chamandy et al. 2015).

We propose here that the strongly polarized radio emis-
sion from the magnetic arms may also suggest the existence
of reconnection regions where cosmic rays are accelerated.
The gas heated by the same process should be detectable in
the X-ray domain (Lesch & Bender 1990; Hanasz & Lesch
2003). By comparing the properties of the hot gas in the
magnetic and spiral arms, we may be able to trace a possi-
ble additional heating of the gas that would be caused by
the reconnection processes.

NGC 6946. The brightest source (identiﬁed at that time
with a very luminous supernova remnant MF16) has a
count rate of 0.07 cts s−1 corresponding to a ﬂux of
8.3 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 in the energy range 0.5-2 keV,
three sources are fainter by about a factor of 10, and the
rest (fainter by a factor of 40) are at the detection thresh-
old.

Holt et al. (2003) studied discrete X-ray sources in
NGC 6946 using a 60 ks Chandra ACIS observation and
found the source population dominated by high-mass X-ray
binaries. Their survey was complete down to approximately
1037 erg s−1 . However, in contrast to previous results, the
ultra-luminous MF16 complex was found to be deﬁcient in
line emission expected from an interaction with a dense sur-
rounding medium. Its spectrum lacks pronounced spectral
lines and can be ﬁt with a variety of models that are all asso-
ciated with unusually high luminosities, leaving the origin of
the MF16 related X-ray emission unknown. Schlegel et al.
(2003) used the same Chandra observations and the lumi-
nosity function derived by Holt et al. (2003) to distinguish
point sources from the diﬀuse emission. These authors esti-
mated that as much as 10% of the total soft X-ray emission
could be due to a hot diﬀuse component.

We checked the Chandra archive and found addi-
tional ACIS-S pointings: one on-axis pointing aiming at
SN2002HH (30 ks, IAU Circ. 8024 and Roberts & Col-
bert 2003), and three (30 ks each) oﬀ-axis pointings cen-
tred on SN2004et. The combination of these Chandra ob-
servations was used by severeal authors (Soria & Perna
2008; Fridriksson et al. 2008; Kajava & Poutanen 2009; Liu
2011) to investigate individual sources (e.g. supernovae,
ultra-luminous sources) in NGC 6946 and their spectral
and temporal variability. Recent observations (20 ks, PI
Kochanek) were also aimed at studying point-source popu-
lations, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

1.3. Immediate objectives

This paper focuses on a detailed analysis of the extended
emission from the hot gas of NGC 6946 with the use of
the data acquired by the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope
(Jansen et al. 2001). The parameters of the hot gas ac-
quired from the spectral analysis of selected regions of the
galaxy are compared with the properties of the radio emis-
sion, especially with its polarized component that traces
the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld of the galaxy.

In the following section (Sect. 2) details of the data re-
duction and analysis are presented. Section 3 presents the
distribution of the X-ray emission from both diﬀuse gas and
point-source populations, and we also describe the spectra
we obtained. In Sect. 4 we thoroughly discuss the results,
including correlations and comparisons with the polarized
radio emission from NGC 6946. We also provide new in-
sight into the nature of the ultra-luminous source MF16.
We conclude in Sect. 5.

1.2. Earlier X-ray observations

Despite the rather high NH-value of about 2 × 1021 cm−2
(see Tab. 2), NGC 6946 was detected by ROSAT’s All Sky
survey with a count rate of 0.1 cts s−1. Analysing the 36
ks ROSAT PSPC pointed observation, Schlegel (1994a,b,c)
apart from SN 1980K additionally reported emission from
nine point-like X-ray sources and diﬀuse emission from

2. Observations and data reduction

NGC 6946 has been observed 11 times between 2003 and
2006 with the XMM-Newton telescope (Jansen et al. 2001),
but the observations always suﬀered from heavy high ﬂaring
radiation. The only observation that yielded any clean data
was made on 13 June 2004 (ObsID 0200670301). Conse-

quently, the galaxy was observed again, on 2 and 8 Novem-
ber 2007 (ObsIDs 0500730201 and 0500730101, respectively,
see Table 2). The data were still aﬀected by high ﬂaring ra-
diation, but this time it was possible to obtain many good-
quality data. The eﬀect of frequent ﬂaring radiation on the
observations was caused by visibility constraints that re-
quired NGC 6946 to be observed at the end of an XMM-
Newton revolution. In recent years the orbit has evolved and
NGC 6946 can be much better observed. Since early 2012
it has become possible to observe this galaxy for almost a
full orbit (144 ks). The most recent observations, performed
between 21 and 23 of December 2012 and aimed at the
ultra-luminous source NGC 6946 X-1 (ObsID 0691570101),
provided a long exposure that was relatively free of high
ﬂaring radiation; this resulted in 98 ks of good data.

The data were processed using the SAS 13.0.0 package
(Gabriel et al. 2004) with standard reduction procedures.
Following the routine of tasks epchain and emchain, event
lists for two EPIC-MOS cameras (Turner et al. 2001) and
the EPIC-pn camera (Strüder et al. 2001) were obtained.
Next, the event lists were carefully ﬁltered for periods of in-
tense radiation of high-energy background by creating light
curves of high-energy emission. These light curves were used
to produce good time interval (GTI) tables, which mark
times of low count rates of high-energy emission. Such ta-
bles (time ranges) were then used to remove the remaining
data when high count rates were observed. The resulting
lists were checked for the residual existence of soft pro-
ton ﬂare contamination, which could inﬂuence the faint ex-
tended emission. To do that, we used a script1 that performs
calculations developed by Molendi et al. (2004). We found
that only the shortest observation (ObsID 0200670301) is
contaminated very slightly by soft proton radiation. To en-
sure the best-quality data (crucial to analyse diﬀuse emis-
sion), we only used events with FLAG=0 and PATTERN≤4
(EPIC-pn) or FLAG=0 and PATTERN≤12 (EPIC-MOS)
in the following data processing.

The ﬁltered event lists were used to produce images,
background images, exposure maps (without vignetting cor-
rection), masked for an acceptable detector area using the

1 http://xmm2.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_sw_cal/
background/epic_scripts.shtml#ﬂare

images script2, modiﬁed by the authors to allow adaptive
smoothing. All images and maps were produced (with ex-
posure correction) in four energy bands of 0.2 - 1 keV, 1 -
2 keV, 2 - 4.5 keV, and 4.5 - 12 keV. The images were then
combined into ﬁnal EPIC images and adaptively smoothed
with a maximum smoothing scale of 30′′ FWHM. The rms
values were obtained by averaging the emission over a large
source-free area in the ﬁnal map.

Another set of images was also constructed after ex-
cluding all point sources found within the D25 diameter
of NGC 6946 from the event lists (see below for details on
point source exclusion). This was done with the help of a
routine used to create re-ﬁlled blank sky background maps
- ghostholes_ind3. In this way we obtained a map of dif-
fuse emission where all regions of excluded point sources
are ﬁlled with emission close to extracted regions by sam-
pling adjacent events and randomising spatial coordinates4.
Although this method is used to handle background maps,
we obtained good results when we applied it to real source
data. Section 3.1.1 presents images of soft (0.2-1 keV) and
medium (1-2 keV) emission, together with a corresponding
hardness ratio map, deﬁned as

HR =

med − soft
med + soft

,

for images with and without detected point sources.

Next, the spectral analysis was performed. To create
spectra we only used the event list from the EPIC-pn cam-
era because it oﬀers the highest sensitivity in the soft en-
ergy band. Only the emission above 0.3 keV was analysed
because the internal noise of the pn camera is too high be-
low this limit5. Although this is not crucial when combined
with MOS cameras to produce images, it is important to
exclude the softest emission below 0.3 keV to obtain reliable
good-quality spectra.

Unsmoothed images for all bands were used to search
for point sources with the standard SAS edetect_chain pro-
cedure. Regions found to include a possible point source
were marked. The area was individually chosen for each
source to ensure that we excluded all pixels brighter than
the surrounding background. These areas were then used to
construct spectral regions for which spectra were acquired.
The non-default way of excluding the detected point
sources helped to keep more diﬀuse emission in the ﬁnal
spectra. However, expecting some contribution from the
PSF wings, we added a power-law component to our model
ﬁts to account for any residual emission. A power-law com-
ponent was also needed to account for unresolved point
sources. The background spectra were obtained using blank
sky event lists (see Carter & Read 2007). These blank sky
event lists were ﬁltered using the same procedures as for the
source event lists. For each spectrum we produced response
matrices and eﬀective area ﬁles. For the latter, detector
maps needed for extended emission analysis were also cre-
ated. The spectra were binned, which resulted in a better

signal-to-noise ratio. To obtain a reasonable number of bins
at the same time, we chose to have 25 total counts per en-
ergy bin. The spectra were ﬁtted using XSPEC 11 (Arnaud
1996).

Since observations 0500730201 and 0500730101 have
identical pointings and position angles, we merged the
cleaned event lists using the SAS task merge. The spec-
tra extracted from this merged lists give the same model-
ﬁtting results as separate spectra ﬁtted simultaneously, but
the errors are better constrained, therefore we used the for-
mer spectra in our ﬁnal analysis. It was not possible to
also merge-in the shortest observation (ObsID 0200670301)
because it has diﬀerent parameters (pointing and position
angle), and simultaneous ﬁtting with the larger data set
showed that both spectra are systematically oﬀset. This re-
sulted in a poorer model ﬁt. We assume that this might
arise because the observation was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by
high ﬂaring radiation and because the ﬁltered ”clean” data
still show residual contamination that might inﬂuence the
spectral ﬁtting. Although we used this observation for im-
age production, we therefore excluded the pn data from our
spectral analysis. For the same inconsistency reasons (dif-
ferent pointing and position angle), we used the longest ob-
servation 0691570101 separately when performing the spec-
tral analysis. This approach resulted in two corresponding
spectra for each of the studied regions. Each pair of spec-
tra was merged (as well as their corresponding background
spectra) using the SAS task epicspeccombine. Although for
multiple spectra a most commonly advised routine is a si-
multaneous ﬁt rather than a ﬁt to a combined spectrum,
we note that for spectra with a very diﬀerent sensitivity
(certainly in our case), a combination of spectra leads to
a much better handle on the background and consequently
a better ﬁt. This is because background subtraction only
takes place for the merged spectrum after the source and
background spectra are combined (contrary to a simulta-
neous ﬁt, where each spectrum is background subtracted
before the ﬁt).

For the overlays we also used the XMM-Newton Optical
Monitor data acquired during the same observations and
produced an image in the UVM2 ﬁlter using the standard
SAS omchain procedure.

3. Results

3.1. Distribution of the X-ray emission

3.1.1. Diﬀuse emission

NGC 6946 shows soft extended X-ray emission correspond-
ing to the entire star-forming disk (Fig. 1), with the bright-
est emission closely following the star-forming regions. Al-
though the southern part of the star-forming disk is less
pronounced than the northern one, no asymmetries of the
emission from the hot gas are visible. In contrast, the X-ray
emission seems to extend farther out beyond star-forming
regions in the southern part of the galaxy. An area of dif-
fuse emission around the galactic centre forms a structure
resembling a very small bar that crosses the central core
and is aligned with the Hα emission.

The hot gas disk visible in the 1-2 keV energy band
(Fig. 2) is extended in a similar way as the emission in the
softer energy band (Fig. 1). This may suggest large amounts
of very hot gas in the galactic disk and/or halo. To further

investigate the contribution from the hottest gas to the X-
ray emission from NGC 6946, we produced a hardness ratio
map using both distributions (Fig. 3).

As mentioned before, the two distribution are similar on
average because the values in most parts of the HR map are
close to 0. Nevertheless, north-east and south-west of the
centre, distinct areas of softer emission are clearly visible.
This corresponds well to the orientation of the bright star-
forming regions visible in the Hα map (Fig. 1). However,
the softest emission is produced in the south-western part
of the disk, where the production of young massive stars is
diminished, as seen in the UV map (Fig. 2).

3.1.2. Point sources

Figure 4 shows all detected point sources within the D25
disk of NGC 6946. For all sources we performed a spec-
tral analysis. For weak sources the hardness ratios (HRs)
were derived (see Table 3). We used the same energy bands
as in Pietsch et al. (2004): (0.2-0.5) keV, (0.5-1.0) keV, (1.0-
2.0) keV, (2.0-4.5) keV, and (4.5-12) keV as bands 1 to 5.
Consequently, the hardness ratios are calculated as HRi =
Bi+1 − Bi/Bi+1 + Bi for i = 1 to 4, where Bi is the count
rate in band i, as deﬁned above. For sources with more than
500 net counts in the total energy band (0.2-12 keV), spec-
tra were extracted and ﬁtted with models (see Sect. 3.2.1).
The left panel of Fig. 4 suggests that some of the sources
might not originate from within the galaxy and are instead
more distant background objects. Moreover, the centre of
the most extended region of source 26 does not seem to co-
incide with the visible Hα clump, but more precise astrom-
etry of the Chandra observation associated this source with
the galaxy (e.g. Kajava & Poutanen 2009). This source is
the brightest point source – the ultra-luminous complex
MF16 that is assumed to be a supernova remnant (e.g.
Matonick & Fesen 1997). It is not a pure point source, as
it is considerably larger than the point spread function of
the XMM-Newton EPIC cameras (of ≃ 12′′).

Another interesting source is source 17, overlapping in
Fig. 4 with sources 16 and 20. This source was not visible
in previous observations (where sources 16 and 20 were de-
tected), but only in the most recent sensitive observations.

3.2. Spectral analysis of the X-ray emission

For spectra of the hot gas we used a model that attributed
one or two thermal plasmas and/or a contribution from un-
resolved point-like sources. Thermal plasma is represented
in this work by a mekal model, which is a model of an emis-
sion spectrum from hot diﬀuse gas based on the model cal-
culations of Mewe and Kaastra (Mewe et al. 1985; Kaastra
1992). In all models we ﬁxed the metallicity to solar. This
was determined by a test spectral ﬁtting of the spectra,
which showed that in a wide range of metallicities (0.1 - 1.5
solar), no signiﬁcant change in gas temperatures or power-
law photon indices could be observed. Slight deviations of
these parameters were still within the errors provided by
the models that used solar metallicity. This suggests that
all diﬀerences that are found in gas temperatures when ﬁt-
ting spectra do not result from a possible combined eﬀect
of abundance gradients and enforcing solar metallicities in
the models. It also shows that an additional power-law com-
ponent in the models of diﬀuse emission does account for

3.2.1. Brightest sources

For almost all sources (except for source 27) for which spec-
tral ﬁtting was performed, we also used the thermal plasma
component (see Table 4) to account for diﬀuse emission pro-
jected onto each of the sources. The amount of this emission
was often signiﬁcant as a result of the sensitive observations
of a gas-rich galaxy with a relatively large point spread
function of the EPIC-pn camera that did not allow clearly
separating the studied sources. Many of the spectra also
required an additional model component to account for the
high internal absorption.

M. Weżgowiec et al.: Hot gas and magnetic arms of...

For one source (source 5) a model with a power-law
component did not give good results. The spectrum was
ﬁtted best when using two thermal components. It is pos-
sible that it is simply a hot gas clump that was classiﬁed
by the source detection routine to be a point source. Al-
ternatively, the lowest count number of all ﬁtted spectra
might also be the reason for diﬃculties in ﬁnding a proper
ﬁt. The hot component ﬁtted in this model reaches values
of almost 2 keV, which is fairly unexpected for the hot gas
in the galactic disk.

For source 17, which was undetected in earlier obser-
vations, a complex model had to be ﬁtted. Its power-law
component is poorly constrained, however. The two sources
near this position that were detected previously, sources 16
and 20, were not detected in the recent sensitive obser-
vation because the brightness of the diﬀuse emission was
higher throughout, and also because the bright source 17
has wings. For consistency of the results, however, we used
all observations to extract spectra for all three sources. Nev-
ertheless, the complexity of the model for source 17 might
be caused by admixtures from the two adjacent sources.

The spectrum of the core region, source 19, where the
densest and the hottest gas might be expected, could be
ﬁtted equally well with either one or two thermal compo-
nents. We present both model ﬁts. The model with two
components yielded 0.32+0.02
−0.06 keV, while
a single temperature component showed a temperature of
0.62±0.04 keV. These values and the derived ﬂuxes for this
region (see Table 5) suggest that most of the emission orig-
inates from the hotter component. The main diﬀerence be-
tween both model ﬁts, however, is a signiﬁcant variation of
the internal absorption (see Table 4).

−0.03 keV and 0.70+0.07

By ﬁtting a model (consisting of one power-law and two
thermal components) to the spectrum of MF16 (source 26),
we obtained a temperature of 1.04±0.03 keV for the hot
component. Still, most of the ﬂux from MF16 originates
from the power-law component that is associated with the
central source. To further investigate the spectrum of this
source, we followed Kajava & Poutanen (2009) and added
a multicolour disk component to our model. We obtained a
similar value for the temperature of the inner disk.

3.2.2. Regions of diﬀuse emission

To analyse emission of the hot gas from NGC 6946, we used
Hα and UV images to choose areas that correspond to the
star-forming regions. The radio morphology of the galaxy
was also taken into account because the most prominent po-
larized features were found between the gaseous spiral arms
of NGC 6946 (see Fig. 10). All selected regions are presented
in Fig. 9. A brief description of all regions is presented in
Table 6. For transparency, region letters are used through-
out this paper. In the process of extracting the spectra, the
emission from point sources (Fig. 4) was excluded.

To investigate the temperature of the hot gas in selected
regions of NGC 6946, we ﬁtted a single thermal plasma
model, adding a power-law component to account for unde-
tected point sources and/or residual emission from excluded
sources. Only regions C and F did not require this addi-
tional power-law component. This could simply be caused
by a lower number of net counts in their spectra, resulting
in a low signal-to-noise ratio, hence lower accuracy of the
ﬁtting, so that the basic models are equally good in ﬁtting
the data. On the other hand, both spectra show very lit-

tle emission above 1 keV, which suggests that the harder
emission from point sources contributes hardly anything.

In Table 7 we present the results of single thermal
plasma model ﬁtting. For regions of the spiral galactic arms
(regions A, E, G, and H), very steep photon indices of the
power-law component are visible, which is unexpected for
typical galactic X-ray point sources. This might be due
to enhanced emission in the soft-to-medium energy band
(around and above 1 keV), however, which can also suggest
that a second thermal component is necessary to account
for the signiﬁcant emission from the hot gas in the galactic
disk. To check this possibility, we ﬁtted a model consisting
of two thermal components for the areas of the spiral arms
and kept the previously introduced power-law component.
Since both parameters and residuals of the new ﬁts were
much more physical, that is, showed values in expected
ranges, we used them as the ﬁnal ﬁts for the subsequent
analysis.

To ensure that a single thermal plasma model is the
best-ﬁt model for the remaining regions (central areas and
interarm regions), we also ﬁtted a model with two ther-
mal components to their corresponding spectra. In all cases
we obtained signiﬁcantly ﬂatter (lower) photon indices of
the power-law component, which suggests that some of the
harder emission from the unresolved point sources was ﬁt-
ted with the new second thermal component. Furthermore,
most of the ﬁtted parameters were poorly constrained. For
some of them it was impossible to get any constraints. The
ﬁnal models for all regions are presented in Table 8.

For regions of the spiral arms for which a model with
two thermal components was used, we assumed that the
cooler component (∼ 0.3 keV) of the hot gas is associated
with the galactic halo and the hotter component (∼ 0.7 keV)
with the emission from the disk, as is observed in edge-on
galaxies (e.g. Tüllmann et al. 2006).

For the remaining regions, that is, for the central ar-
eas and the interarm regions, we assumed that the single
thermal component can be described as a mixture of gas
components from the disk and the halo above. The param-
eters of these components seem to be similar to the level,
which does not allow clearly separating them at a given
sensitivity level. For the interarm regions this can be easily
explained by the lack of star-forming regions in the disk,
which causes the gas to be relatively uniform throughout
the entire volume. Nevertheless, we cannot use this argu-
ment for the central regions of the galaxy, where the disk
emission is certainly signiﬁcant. A reasonable explanation
for this case is a high star-forming activity of NGC 6946
and the consequent internal absorption that is highest in
the central densest part of the galactic disk. This absorp-
tion may cause some of the disk emission from the central
regions I and J to remain hidden, and the rest, together
with the halo gas, mimics a homogenous medium.

Region B shows almost no Hα or UV emission, while re-
gion J includes the central parts of the galaxy. Both regions
diﬀer signiﬁcantly in the value of the ﬁtted temperature of
the hot gas. It is much hotter (0.60+0.06
−0.08 keV) for the quiet
region B than for region J with its clear galactic-disk (nu-
clear) emission (0.42+0.09
−0.05 keV). The remaining single ther-
mal component model ﬁts show that the temperature of
the hot gas is between 0.5 keV and 0.55 keV. Halo compo-
nents of the model ﬁts to the regions of spiral arms show
a very constant temperature of around 0.28 keV. For the
disk components, however, diﬀerences are observed, as the

south-western and western part of the disk (spiral arms
A and H) have a signiﬁcantly lower temperature than the
eastern and north-eastern part (spiral arms E and G).

For all regions except for region H (western spiral arm)
most of the X-ray ﬂux is produced by the power-law com-
ponent that is attributed to unresolved and/or residual
emission from point sources. For the exceptional region H
we note, however, that the value of the power-law ﬂux is
only poorly constrained. Therefore, its value might be much
higher, which would lead to a higher contribution to the
total ﬂux. A high contribution from the power-law compo-
nents of the ﬁts might arise because NGC 6946 is a star-
burst galaxy with a large population of X-ray point sources
(Fig. 4). The method of source extraction used in this pa-
per, described in Sect. 2, might certainly cause this eﬀect.
However, as argued before, this ensured that as little as pos-
sible of the diﬀuse emission has been lost by point-source
extraction.

For the regions of the spiral arms, more ﬂux comes from
the halo components according to the ﬁts, which agrees
with a physical picture where halo emission is produced in
a much larger volume density of the underlying star forma-
tion. These fractions are equal only for the western spiral
arm (region H); we discuss this in Sect. 4.2.1 in more detail.

4. Discussion

4.1. Point sources

Of the 35 point sources found in the galactic disk of
NGC 6946, for 19 of them we were able to calculate only the
hardness ratios. All values are presented in Table 3. For the
remaining sources we ﬁtted models to the acquired spectra
(see Sect. 3.2.1). As mentioned above, all sources except for
source 27 required an additional thermal component in the
model. This was most likely due to the characteristics of
the observations with the XMM-Newton telescope, that is,
a relatively low resolution with a high sensitivity to diﬀuse
X-ray emission. As a result, all spectra of the studied point
sources included signiﬁcant information from the diﬀuse gas
present across the entire disk of NGC 6946.

For several sources, an additional component to account
for internal absorption was needed to obtain a good ﬁt (see
Table 4). For three sources, 19, 23, and 32, this was crucial.
For source 19, which is the core region of NGC 6946 and
therefore not just a point source, this additional absorption
is easy to explain because we observe the densest parts of
the galaxy. The two other sources, however, are located in
areas relatively free of star formation (see Fig. 4, left). Fur-
thermore, none of the extended regions used for the spec-
tral analysis of the diﬀuse emission coming from the hot
gas needed an additional internal absorption component to
be described by the model. Therefore, the argument of (rel-
atively) low-resolution observations of a gas- and dust-rich
galaxy cannot be used here. Instead, for each source that
required an internal absorption component in the model, we
propose that it is an X-ray binary (or an intermediate-mass
black hole, IMBH) surrounded by a dust torus.

To calculate luminosities of the spectrally analysed
point sources, we only used the ﬂuxes of the power-law
component to exclude the contribution from the galactic
hot gas in the modelled spectrum (Table 5). Half of the
sources show luminosities higher than 1039erg s−1. This
value is the most widely used observational deﬁnition of
an ultra-luminous source (ULX); it is often associated with
an accreting IMBH that forms in the core collapse of young
dense stellar clusters (e.g. Miller & Hamilton 2002). Since
the abundance of ULXs is often linked to recent star forma-
tion activity (e.g. Berghea et al. 2013), a signiﬁcant number
of ULXs in NGC 6946 agrees well with the vivid star for-
mation of this galaxy.

One of these sources is the nebula MF 16 (region 26)
mentioned above. Although some of its thermal emission
(from both model components) can be associated with the
galactic hot gas, as mentioned above, a signiﬁcant contri-
bution from the hotter component needs a diﬀerent ex-
planation. That the gas temperature exceeds 1 keV (Ta-
ble 4), which is much higher than the temperature of the
disk gas, may provide further evidence that MF16 might
be indeed a supernova remnant, as previously claimed by
Matonick & Fesen (1997), and the very high temperature of
the hot gas may result from shock heating of the medium
surrounding the explosion region. This contradicts the ﬁnd-
ings of Berghea & Dudik (2012), who claimed that no signs
of shock heating are present.

4.2. Extended emission

4.2.1. Parameters of the hot gas

From our spectral model ﬁts we were able to derive more
parameters of the hot gas, including electron densities ne,
masses M , thermal energies ǫth, and cooling times τ . To
perform our calculations we used the model of thermal
cooling and ionization equilibrium of Nulsen et al. (1984),
where LX = 1.11 · Λ(T ) n2
e V η, η is an unknown ﬁll-
ing factor and Λ(T ) is a cooling coeﬃcient of the order
of 10−22 erg cm3 s−1 for temperatures of a few millions K
(Raymond et al. 1976). However, the main diﬃculty in cal-
culating the physical parameters of the hot gas component
are the assumptions about the emitting volume V .

It seems straightforward to assume that we only see soft
X-ray emission from the visible side of the disk (and there-
fore the halo), with all emission from the other side be-
ing absorbed by the neutral hydrogen in the galactic disk.
For the visible part of the halo emission, we assumed a
cylindrical volume above the disk of NGC 6946, extending
out to half of the D25 diameter of the galaxy (10 kpc). In
this geometry, the halo around NGC 6946 would be roughly
spherical. This approach seems to be justiﬁed for a starbust
galaxy that has signiﬁcantly extended halos of the X-ray
emission. For the disk emission we assumed a disk thick-
ness of 1 kpc. For the interarm regions, for which a single
thermal model was ﬁtted, we used volumes of 10 kpc times
the area of a region, as the model describes the mixed emis-
sion from both the disk and the halo (see Sect. 3.2.2).

Tables 10 and 11 present the derived parameters of the

hot gas in the areas of diﬀuse emission in NGC 6946.

To verify the obtained values, a comparison with earlier
Chandra observations of NGC 6946 by Schlegel et al. (2003)
would be an important step. Because of the low sensitivity
to diﬀuse emission of these observations, the analysis was
unfortunately made only for the entire galactic disk and
no detailed study is available. Still, their temperatures of
0.25±0.03 keV and 0.70±0.10 keV for two thermal compo-
nents agree very well with our values for the halo and the
disk gas temperatures, respectively. The electron density of
∼0.012 (× η−0.5) cm−3 derived by Schlegel et al. (2003) for
the 1 kpc thick disk also matches our results well if we con-
sider a ten times larger volume than used for our calcula-
tions. A similar study of six other nearby face-on late-type
spiral galaxies was reported by Owen & Warwick (2009),
who obtained temperatures of two thermal model ﬁts of
0.2-0.3 keV and 0.6-0.7 keV and the derived electron densi-
ties of the gas of the order of a few 10−3 (× η−0.5) cm−3,
depending on the level of the star-forming activity.

4.2.2. Hot gas components

As mentioned before, for the regions of the spiral arms we
needed a two-temperature model to account for the emis-
sion from the hot gas residing in both galactic disk and the
surrounding halo. Although the temperatures of the hot gas
are almost identical for the halo components and similar
for the disk components (where two pairs could be distin-
guished - A with H and E with G - see Table 8), the derived
parameters show signiﬁcant diﬀerences (see Table 11). As
expected, for the north-eastern spiral arm with the bright-
est Hα and UV emission, marked as region G, we obtained

all spiral arms.

4.2.3. Magnetic ﬁelds in NGC 6946

To analyse the magnetic ﬁeld parameters we used the same
regions as for the spectral analysis. For each region both
total intensity and polarized intensity ﬂuxes at a radio
wavelength of 6.2 cm with a beam of 15′′ were obtained.
Then, using the energy equipartition formula provided by
Beck & Krause (2005), we calculated the strengths of both
the total and ordered magnetic ﬁelds. The calculations were
made assuming a synchrotron spectral index of 1.0, an incli-
nation of the galactic disk of 30◦, and a proton-to-electron
ratio of 100. For the emitting volume a disk of 1 kpc thick-
ness was assumed. The main uncertainties are introduced
by the last two parameters. They may vary by a factor of 2.
With the assumed spectral index this amounts to an error
of ∼ 30% for the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and ∼ 60%
for its energy density. We note here, however, that such er-
rors are systematic, which means that we may in fact expect
the relative uncertainties between the points to be smaller.
Table 12 summarizes our results and also provides values
for the energy densities of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Apart from the central regions of the galaxy (regions D
and J), the strength of the total magnetic ﬁeld is roughly
constant across the disk. A slight increase can be observed
in the most prominent spiral arms (regions A and G). Con-
sequently, these regions show higher energy densities of the
magnetic ﬁeld, with the maximum near the galactic core.
The strengths of the ordered magnetic ﬁeld are also similar
in all parts of the disk, with higher values in the areas of
the magnetic arms and the central region of the galaxy. As
suggested by Fig. 10, the areas of the magnetic arms show a
much higher degree of polarization than the other regions.

4.2.4. Hot gas and magnetic ﬁelds of spiral and magnetic

arms

In addition to the grand-design structure of its gaseous spi-
ral arms, NGC 6946 presents a distinct spiral structure of
the magnetic ﬁelds which resembles magnetic arms that are
phase-shifted with regard to the gaseous ones. These mag-
netic arms coincide well with the interarm regions. Since the
spiral arm and interarm regions vary signiﬁcantly in terms
of the ISM structure, we investigated the emission from the
hot gas in both areas to obtain more clues about the in-
terplay of the magnetic ﬁeld and the hot plasma. Because

a model with two thermal components was used to anal-
yse the emission from the spiral arms (accounting for the
disk and halo components), to compare it with the emis-
sion from the hot gas in and above the interarm (magnetic
arm) areas, we needed to calculate averages of the values
obtained from the two-temperature ﬁts.

We added gas masses and thermal energies for the ap-
propriate regions. Next, we calculated number and energy
densities, taking into account the volumes assumed for the
disk and halo component emission (the area of a given re-
gion times 1 or 10 kpc, respectively). Our results are pre-
sented in Table 13. We compared the averaged values of
number and energy densities for all spiral arm regions with
respective values for the interarm regions. We also calcu-
lated the ratios of the thermal energy densities to number
densities, hence obtaining an average energy per particle,
which is independent of the unknown volume-ﬁlling factor
(Ep = ǫ/n).

We present our results in Table 14. The interarm re-
gions show higher values of an energy per particle than for
the spiral arm regions. This is consistent with the single-
temperature ﬁts (Fig. 7), which show slightly higher tem-
peratures for the regions of the magnetic arms. This means
that there may be an additional eﬀect that provides ther-
mal energy to the interarm regions. Since this additional
heating might also be due to magnetic reconnection, we
analysed the magnetic ﬁeld properties of the areas of the
spiral arms and the interarm regions.

4.2.5. Heating of the gas by magnetic reconnection?

observed in edge-on spiral galaxies), we do not have any
direct information on their structure and strength in the
case of NGC 6946. The observed radio emission is, how-
ever, an integration along the line of sight, that is, we see
contributions from both the galaxy disk and halo. Since
the majority of the cosmic rays originates in the underly-
ing disk, an assumption for the emitting volume (the disk)
seems to be justiﬁed. As the vertical scale height of the halo
magnetic ﬁelds of ∼ 6 − 7 kpc (e.g. Beck 2015) is similar to
the assumed size of the hot gas halo (10 kpc), we do not ex-
pect a signiﬁcant change of the magnetic energy density in
the halo, especially when an uncertainty of its calculation
(60%) is considered. It is therefore justiﬁed to compare the
obtained magnetic energy densities with those of the hot
gas in and above the interarm regions.

Still, for all areas of the disk of NGC 6946 we see much
higher energy densities of the magnetic ﬁelds than those
of the disk component of the hot gas (Tables 11 and 12).
Interestingly, for the region of the most prominent spiral
arm (region G), conditions closest to equilibrium are ob-
served, with the energy density of the magnetic ﬁeld only
22% higher than that of the hot gas in the galactic disk.
For the remaining spiral arms this diﬀerence is as high as
50 − 63%. If we compare the magnetic ﬁeld energy densities
to those of the halo (Tables 10 and 11) or averaged values
for the hot gas in and above the spiral arms (disk+halo,
Table 13), a distinct dominance of magnetic ﬁelds by a fac-
tor of a few is visible. This suggests that only in the areas
of high star-forming activity it is possible that the ther-
mal energy density of the gas is similar to that of the local
magnetic ﬁelds.

Because for the interarm regions we have the information
about the hot gas coming from both the disk and the above
halo (one-temperature ﬁt to the spectra), a direct com-
parison of the energy densities of disk hot gas and mag-
netic ﬁelds is possible for the regions of the spiral arms
alone. Nevertheless, since we are interested in the global
energy budget of the galaxy, we need information about
both thermal and magnetic energy densities for the disk
and the halo. Although halo magnetic ﬁelds surely exist (as

To investigate the interplay between the thermal gas
and the magnetic ﬁelds in greater detail, we compared the
averaged (i.e. from both disk and halo components) ther-
mal energies per particle with the magnetic ﬁeld energy
densities for the spiral and magnetic arms. We calculated
the average values for the gaseous spiral arms and the mag-
netic arms, which resulted in an energy density of the mag-
netic ﬁeld of about 10.1 × 10−12 erg cm−3 for the spiral arms
and 8.2 × 10−12 erg cm−3 for the interarm regions and for

energies per particle of 0.90× 10−9 erg and 1.32× 10−9 erg,
respectively. Our results are presented in Table 14. An anti-
correlation between the magnetic ﬁeld strength (and its en-
ergy) and the thermal energy of the gas is visible (Fig. 13);
with a slight decrease of the energy density of the magnetic
ﬁeld (by 23%), the energy per particle increases signiﬁcantly
(by 68%).

A possible explanation is that in regions that simulta-
neously show higher thermal energies of the gas and lower
energies of the magnetic ﬁelds, some of the energy of the
magnetic ﬁeld might have been converted into thermal en-
ergy by magnetic reconnection. Fast reconnection should
be possible in most astrophysical plasmas (Hanasz & Lesch
2003), with a heating rate proportional to the Alfvén speed
(Lesch & Bender 1990; Lazarian et al. 2015). As the gas
density in the interarm regions is lower while the total mag-
netic ﬁeld is almost as strong as in the spiral arms, the
Alfvén speed is higher, and hence the heating rate is higher
in interarm regions. Indeed, we do observe such an addi-
tional heating of the gas in the magnetic arm regions (see
Tables 7 and 8).

In general, such a slight increase in temperature in the
interarm regions could be easily explained by longer cooling
times that are due to the lower density of the gas. However,
if we compare interarm regions B and C with F and I, we
note that in magnetic arms B and C higher temperatures,
lower number and energy densities than in magnetic arms F
and I were obtained. Surprisingly, the diﬀerence in cooling
times reaches almost a factor of 2. Still, for all four inter-
arm regions practically the same magnetic ﬁeld strengths
and energy densities were observed. The diﬀerence is visi-
ble, however, when ordered ﬁelds are considered – in both
regions B and C we see a much higher regularity of the ﬁeld
(i.e. the ratio of the strengths of ordered and total magnetic
ﬁeld). This trend is visible in all magnetic arms when com-

pared to the spiral arms – the regularity of the magnetic
ﬁeld increases with the energy per particle (Fig. 14).

The above ﬁndings allow constructing a picture of both
turbulence and reconnection acting in a galactic disk. Al-
though in the spiral arms reconnection eﬀects are expected
to be more eﬃcient (stronger ﬁeld tangling), their action
might be diﬃcult to see because both the heating and ﬁeld
(dis)ordering is dominated by turbulence. In the interarm
regions, however, where the magnetic ﬁeld is highly or-
dered, reconnection heating may dominate turbulence heat-
ing, and the increase in temperature due to reconnection
heating might be noticeable. This is what we observe, es-
pecially in the magnetic arms B and C, which have slightly
higher temperatures than most star-forming spiral arms.
Although reconnection is a very local process, acting at dis-
tances of a few pc or less, if it is equally eﬃcient throughout
the entire magnetic arm, it might contribute to the ﬁeld
ordering, an eﬀect that would last longer because of the
weaker turbulence. Again, this high ﬁeld ordering is most
distinctly seen in magnetic arms B and C.

The region of the western spiral arm (region H) is inter-
esting. While for the other spiral arm regions we observe a
signiﬁcant contribution from the halo component (see Ta-
ble 9), region H shows almost equal contributions from the
halo and disk components. Furthermore, the diﬀerence of
temperatures of the two components is the lowest in this
region, owing mainly to the lowest temperature of all spiral
arm disk components. This may suggest that for the west-
ern spiral arm mixing of the disk and the halo gas is the
most eﬃcient. Since the southern part of region H is in the
area of strong Faraday depolarization, as reported by Beck
(1991, 2007), this might be a piece of evidence for verti-
cal magnetic ﬁelds and enhanced outﬂow speed in this area
of the galactic disk. In particular the region of the south-
western spiral arm (region A), which also contributes to the

5. Summary and conclusions

The detailed analysis of the X-ray emission from the hot gas
in NGC 6946, together with earlier radio continuum studies,
can be summarized as follows:

- A spectral analysis of the point sources revealed a signif-
icant number of ULXs, which agrees with the enhanced
star formation of the galaxy.

- The galaxy presents signiﬁcant emission from the hot
gas across its entire star-forming disk. Intensity en-
hancements are found in the regions of the spiral arms,
also in the harder energy band. A signiﬁcant amount

of the very soft emission is found in the region of high
Faraday depolarization.

- The radio-polarized emission structure is reﬂected in the
spectral properties of the hot gas - areas of magnetic
arms visible in the interarm regions are well described
with a single thermal plasma model, which shows that
the temperature of the hot gas is slightly higher than in
the spiral arm regions.

- An increase in temperature of the hot gas in the mag-
netic arm regions could be described as additional heat-
ing due to magnetic reconnection.

- A possible conversion of magnetic ﬁeld energy into ther-
mal energy of the hot gas in the interarm regions is
suggested by the lower energy density and strength of
the magnetic ﬁeld and the higher thermal energy per
particle, when compared to the areas of the spiral arms.
- In the conditions of low turbulence in the magnetic arm
regions, reconnection, acting mostly on tangled ﬁelds,
might also contribute to the ﬁeld ordering, as suggested
by both the highest temperatures of the hot gas and the
highest degree of polarization in magnetic arms B and
C.

- We found signatures of a very hot gas in the area of the
ultra-luminous source MF 16, which may suggest shock
heating of the gas by a supernova explosion.
