Abstract

Climate change has received an extensive attention from pub-
lic opinion in the last couple of years, after being considered
for decades as an exclusive scientiﬁc debate. Governments
and world-wide organizations such as the United Nations are
working more than ever on raising and maintaining public
awareness toward this global issue.
In the present study,
we examine and analyze Climate Change conversations in
Qatar’s Twittersphere, and sense public awareness towards
this global and shared problem in general, and its various re-
lated topics in particular. Such topics include but are not lim-
ited to politics, economy, disasters, energy and sandstorms.
To address this concern, we collect and analyze a large dataset
of 109 million tweets posted by 98K distinct users living in
Qatar – one of the largest emitters of co2 worldwide. We use
a taxonomy of climate change topics created as part of the
United Nations Pulse project to capture the climate change
discourse in more than 36K tweets. We also examine which
topics people refer to when they discuss climate change, and
perform different analysis to understand the temporal dynam-
ics of public interest toward these topics.

Introduction

In 2011, the state of Qatar was designated by the World Bank
as the highest per-capita emitters of CO2 in the world with
more than 44.02 metric tons per person [19]. This surpris-
ingly high rank is actually due to Qatar’s massive energy
sector and relatively small population. With a population of
only 2.4 million in 2015 (1.8 million in 2011), Qatar was in
2013 the world’s fourth-largest dry natural gas producer, and
world’s ﬁrst liqueﬁed natural gas (LNG) exporter in 2014
[10]. Given the serious implications that such high emis-
sions of greenhouse gases may have on population’s health
and wellbeing and on the national eco-system and biodiver-
sity equilibrium, the government of Qatar has taken many
steps toward limiting the country’s ecological footprint [1].
For instance, Qatar hosted in 2012 the Conference of the
Parties (COP18) of the United Nations Framework Conven-
tion on Climate Change where an agreement was signed to
extend the life of Kyoto protocol till 2020 [15].

Qatar’s mission to limit the country’s carbon footprint
is part of a global movement to act on the urgent warn-

ings emanating from the scientiﬁc communities about Cli-
mate Change. Governments and world-wide organizations
such as the United Nations are working more than ever on
raising and maintaining public awareness toward this issue.
While sensing the engagement of governments to mitigate
the causes of climate changes such as dioxide carbon emis-
sions is relatively straightforward by looking at the interna-
tional treaties and protocols ratiﬁed, it is not clear how to
achieve the same objective at citizens’ scale, who are part of
the causes and consequences of this shared problem. Tra-
ditional surveys such as ﬁeld interviews are costly and do
not scale for obvious reasons. To address this concern, we
analyze Twitter’s content to sense the awareness of people
toward climate change and investigate their interest toward
its multiple topics. The recent multiplication of hazardous
natural disasters around the world and the news coverage
they received have helped disseminate awareness among in-
dividuals about the consequences of climate change prob-
lems, which happens to be ampliﬁed by social network plat-
forms.

Main contributions.
In this study, we are interested in
sensing the public interest in climate change of people liv-
ing in Qatar. This is achieved by analyzing a large collection
of tweets posted between 2011 and 2016. Unlike previous
studies that focused either on a limited set of climate change
related keywords or on a set of geo-coded tweets (represent-
ing only 2% of twitter trafﬁc), our approach aims at captur-
ing most of the discourse related to climate change under
its different aspects ranging from politics and economy to
energy and disasters. Our main contributions include: (i)
We identiﬁed of 117K users (5% of the entire population)
claiming they live in Qatar and collected all their climate
change related tweets using a rich taxonomy of topics de-
veloped by the United Nations; (ii) We propose to use net-
work backbones analysis to better understand relationships
between hashtags in co-occurrence graphs; (iii) We analyze
different time series of different topics and infer the most
driving topics discussed in the context of climate change.

Challenges. The main challenge we encountered in this
study was identifying a relevant and accurate taxonomy of
terms to use in order to retrieve climate change related posts.

Many studies have focused on the usage of a single word,
i.e., climate in [4], climate change in [7], and some of them
added a handful of other terms to it such as global warm-
ing in [6, 17]. We ﬁnally decided to use a taxonomy de-
veloped by a United Nations work group including climate
change experts and social scientists [16]. The taxonomy is
composed by a set of topics, each one is deﬁned by a set
of keywords or hashtags that should co-occur in a particular
way. The experts have tried as much as possible to keep the
set of terms that deﬁne topics disjoint. The other challenge
was to identify correctly users living in Qatar and crawl all
their tweets. We have provided a heuristic based on follow-
ing relationship and a gazetteer of locations to ﬁnd relevant
users. Parsing a collection of 109 million tweets to extract
climate change related ones, and working to keep the level of
noise to its minimum possible level was a challenging task
as many manual checking was required.

Context of the study.
In this study, we focus on Twitter
conversations related to environmental issues posted by peo-
ple living in Qatar. Qatar is a small peninsula in the Arabian
Gulf. It is the home of a native population of approximately
300,000 Qataris, who live among a total population of 2.4
million [13]. Internet penetration is high in Qatar; 85% of
the population has Internet access. In addition, social me-
dia are popular and widely used among the native popula-
tion –65% of Qataris have an Instagram account, 44% are
on Facebook, and 46% use Twitter [11].

Roadmap. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We start by providing a literature review on related work.
Then, we deﬁne the methods used for the analysis. Next, we
describe the datasets we collected. Then, follows a section
that presents and discusses our ﬁndings. Finally, we con-
clude the paper with some insights.

Literature Review

Climate change is a major challenge facing the world, with
myriad causes and consequences. One of the leading con-
tributors to the rising levels of CO2 emissions is the activity
of humans in urban places, as a consequence, the unmanage-
able rising of CO2 emissions altered global climatic condi-
tions and indirectly harms the environmental ecosystem 1.
In order to strategically raise public awareness on climate
change issues, and protect the world’s shared natural en-
vironment for sustainable and spiritual beneﬁt, researchers
have analyzed public opinions to identify public awareness,
examine this trend on the social media sphere and investi-
gate lasting public awareness plans.

As most people have limited resources to get accurate data
on air pollution and climate change, Wang and Paul [18]
have investigated the value of social media as a sensor of
air quality and public response. Authors analyzed more than
93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China’s largest mi-
croblogging service and found a high correlation with par-
ticle pollution levels, which makes the use of social media

1http://www.un.org/climatechange/

data valuable to augment existing air pollution surveillance
data, especially perception.

Alternatively, other studies have demonstrated the utility
of social media data sources to analyze public awareness
about climate change, and the inﬂuence of mass media to
interpret global climate problems from the different angles
(causes and remedies) [5]. While Veltri and Atanasova [17]
highlighted the potential opportunity of using social media
to analyze and understand public opinion dynamics. Oltre-
anu et al. [9] compared the coverage of climate change in
both, social media and mainstream news. This comparison
uncovered signiﬁcant differences between triggers, actions,
and news values of events covered in both types of media.
For instance, mainstream news sources frequently feature
extreme weather events framed as being a consequence of
climate change, as well as high-proﬁle government publica-
tions and meetings. In contrast, actions by individuals, legal
actions involving governments, and investigative journalism
feature frequently as viral events in social media.

As most of people have no deep scientiﬁc understanding
on climate change, their perceptions are most likely inﬂu-
enced by framing strategies [20] , which leads the research
community to question public opinions over time and lo-
cation, along with the role that mass media played. Cody
et al. [4] studied user sentiment toward climate change by
analyzing environment-related tweets posted between 2008
and 2014. The study shed a light on how climate news,
events, and disasters affects people’s sentiment. An et al.
[2] also conduct an opinion analysis of climate change re-
lated tweets. Authors aimed at understanding whether Twit-
ter data mining can complement and supplement insights
about climate change perceptions, especially how such per-
ceptions may change over time upon exposure to climate
related hazards. A combination of techniques drawn from
text mining, hierarchical sentiment analysis and time series
methods is employed for this purpose. At a large scale, Jang
and Hart [6] investigated how people incorporate climate
change into everyday conversation by the stream of Twitter
over two years. Their study shows geographical differences
in the use of frames and terms concerning climate change,
and how certain frames that promote skepticism about cli-
mate change are widely circulated by users within speciﬁc
regional and political contexts.

In this paper, we analyze climate change conversations
and air quality trends in Qatar through the lens of social
media data, and investigate the ability of measuring public
awareness, along with the impact of environmental factors
on public conversations.

Methods

We describe in this section the methods we used in this
study.

Building the Network of Co-occurrences
The relationship between different concepts in the dataset
can be suitably represented as a network. Nodes in the net-
work represent concepts, and a link from node i to node j
implies that the corresponding concepts of the two nodes

co-occur in the same tweet. More importantly, each node
bears an associated quantity a that stands for the proportion
of tweets in which it appears. On the other hand, each link
from i to j has an associated weight (i, j, w), which states
the fraction of tweets in which these two nodes co-occur.

Network backbone extraction
Networks can be described from different levels of analy-
sis. At the micro level, the focus lies on single nodes and
their speciﬁc positions within the overall structure; this level
can be described in terms of node degree, strength or clus-
tering coefﬁcient, among other metrics. At the macro level,
the focus shifts to the aggregation of those metrics and the
properties of their distribution. Between these two extremes,
we have a third level of analysis, the mesoscale, which aims
at accounting for the complexity of networks between the
position of individual nodes and the relational properties of
the collectives they form. It is at this level where reduction
techniques like backbone extraction operate.

Network backbone extraction refers to the ﬁltering tech-
niques aimed at uncovering relevant information; in general,
such techniques aim at pruning the links of a network, keep-
ing only those which are statistically relevant. Ideally, the
reduced structure is computationally more tractable while it
retains most of the interesting features of the original one.
We apply the state of the art backbone extraction algorithm
proposed in [12] to the network of hashtag co-occurrences.
In their work, Serrano et al. exploit the empirical trend by
which link weights are heavily ﬂuctuating, i.e., only few
links carry the largest proportion of the node’s strength.

Linear Correlation
We use Pearson product-moment coefﬁcient to measure the
linear correlation between different pairs of variables (en-
vironment topics and weather conditions) of interest in this
study. Pearson correlation score ranges in [−1, 1] where 1
(resp. -1) means the existence of total positive (resp. nega-
tive) correlation and 0 means no correlation at all. Pearson
formula between two time series X and Y is given below:

ρX,Y =

E[(X − µX )(Y − µY )]

σX σY

(1)

where: µX , µY are the means of X, Y respectively, and
σX , σY are the standard deviations of the two corresponding
time series.

Datasets

To conduct this study, we need to combine data from two
different sources: Twitter and Weather Underground.

We use Twitter to collect user generated content about
environment related topics. As there is not solicitation for
users to post on Twitter, we claim that this data reﬂects the
actual and natural responses to users toward different envi-
ronmental topics as they get exposed to them through news
media or witness them happening during natural disasters,
heavy rains, drought, etc. Underground Weather is used
to collect daily weather conditions in Doha, the capital of
Qatar. It is worth noticing that Qatar is a relatively small

(a) Tweets

country (area: 11,586 km2) with more than 80% of its pop-
ulation based in the city of Doha. Thus, the weather does
not vary that much from a location to another in the coun-
try. We explain in the following the processes by which we
collected and curated the different datasets.

Identifying users of Qatar
First, we created a gazetteer of locations in Qatar including
the names of main cities and districts in both English and
Arabic, and under different spellings. We matched this list to
a 45 day sample of the Twitter Decahose (a sample of 10% of
all Twitter trafﬁc.) For each user whose tweet was captured,
we requested the list of their followers based on the intuition
that for an average user, followers are more likely to be from
the same country.

Then, we requested the proﬁles of the followers and ﬁlter
out those users who did not mention a location correspond-
ing to Qatar’s gazetteer. The same process was iteratively
executed on the list of newly added users; i.e., ﬁnd their fol-
lower IDs, then follower proﬁles, then ﬁlter out followers
with irrelevant locations, until no new users are identiﬁed.
To expand the list of users even further, a social analytics
tool (FollowerWonk.com) was used to obtain lists of users
who mention a location associated with our gazetteer. This
list was then merged with the list obtained earlier from Dec-
ahose and Twitter API. The resulting list consists of over
117K users who claim to be living in Qatar in their Twitter
proﬁles.

Collecting user tweets
We use Twitter Historical API2 to collect up to 3,200 tweets
posted (the maximum allowed by Twitter API) for each of
the users of Qatar identiﬁed in the previous step. This col-
lection has been conducted twice. The ﬁrst time was in July

2https://dev.twitter.com/, last accessed on Feb,2016

2014 and the second time was in February 2016. Hence,
we could obtain for each user up to 6,400 tweets he posted
over a period of nine years (from 2007 to 2016). This col-
lection generated a total of 109.6 million tweets posted by
more than 98,066 different users. The remaining missing
users have either a disabled or protected account. As Twitter
was launched in 2006 only, the activity of the users of Qatar
was very marginal before 2011. Thus, we focus in this study
on the time period spanning from January 1rst, 2011 to Jan-
uary 1rst, 2016.

Weather data
We use Weather Underground (WU) API [14] to collect
data about daily weather conditions in Qatar for the same
time period. Out of the sixty different measurements WU
API returns, we were particularly interested in the ones that
are more likely to sprinkle climate change related tweets,
temperature (◦C), humidity
these measurements include:
(%), wind speed (km/h), visibility (km), and precipitation
(mm) (including: rain, snow, etc.)

Extracting environment and climate change tweets
In order to identify the climate change related content, we
use a taxonomy of keywords grouped into topics on inter-
est. Previous studies have used simple keywords to ﬁlter
climate change tweets. Cody and Reagan for instance used
only one word climate [4]. Veltri and Atanasova used two
keywords climate change and global warming [17] while
Andrei and Svetlana added translations of the aforemen-
tioned words in German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish
[7]. Jang and Har also used the keywords climate change
and global warming paired with some speciﬁc terms related
to different frames [6].

We use in this paper a taxonomy of climate change
topics[16] developed by the UN Global Pulse team. The
taxonomy consists of set of topics, each of which is deﬁned
with a list of terms and hashtags that should co-occur in a
particular way. According to Ren´e Clausen Nielsen – data
innovation specialist in UN Global Pulse – the taxonomy is
created by climate change experts as follows: (1) ﬁnd a list
of relevant words. (2) ﬁnd synonyms, plurals, and abbre-
viations by searching Twitter and dictionaries.
(3) Group
words into distinct topics. (4) Create negative ﬁlters to get
rid of occurring noise [8].

topics are carefully deﬁned not

An important feature of the used taxonomy is the fact
that
to allow overlap-
ping. These topics are: General, Risk&Disaster ,Poli-
tics&Opinion, Economy, Energy, Oceans&Water ,Weather
,Agriculture&Forestry, Arctic , Campaigns , Negotia-
tions&Summits. For a tweet to be labeled as belonging to
a particular topic, it should satisfy a list of conditions. For
instance, a tweet is about Politics&Opinions if and only if
it CONTAINS ANY {climate, enviro, environment, carbon}
AND NOT CONTAINS ANY {monoxide, fork, copy, ﬁber}
AND CONTAINS ANY {politics, group of eight, . . .}.

The dusty construction sites in the middle of the city, and
the ﬂat dusty landscape stretching out of the capital’s bor-
ders, both contribute to complicated air quality conditions.

We added Air Quality topic separately to captures conver-
sations around air quality and sense how people talk about
the air they breath by tracking words that refer to air and air
pollution (e.g., air quality, air pollution ). Like Countries in
the region, Qatar has built cities in the middle of the desert.
Heavy sandstorms hit the country regularly, and keep ﬁne
dust hanging in the air for days. Thus we added Sandstorm
topic composed of terms such as duststorm, dusty, and sand
storm. A full list of topics with their respective deﬁnitions,
terms, and matching conditions can be downloaded from [3].

Data Curation
Next, we started doing a qualitative analysis on our dataset
to determine content that might not be relevant in our analy-
sis. We have noticed that some irrelevant keywords such as
Syria, California, Colorado, etc. were appearing to the top
of co-occurrence lists. The manual inspection allowed us
to identify some bots that were re-tweeting all tweets about
Syria with by appending US state names as hashtags.

At the end of this process, we obtained a clean set of
36,612 environment relevant tweets posted by 8,470 differ-
ent users (also known as tweeps).

Figure 1 shows the geo-coded tweets related to environ-
ment that we have gathered, and a population census from
2010 for comparison. The most populated area is deﬁnitely
around the capital city of Doha, with beaches and main roads
being other popular posting sites. A shallow visual inspec-
tion reveals that posting proﬁciency is correlated with popu-
lation density in general.

Results

In this section, we present the results of different analy-
sis performed on the set of environment-related tweets de-
scribed in the previous section. First, we show the temporal
trends of people reactions to different environmental topics.
We show also the most prominent hashtags associated with

different topics. Then, we look at the co-occurrence graph of
these hashtags to unveil different hashtag relationships and
graph topologies. Finally, we analyze user proﬁles to check
whether users posting about environment demonstrate any
speciﬁc characteristics.

Temporal dynamics
Figure 2 shows the trends of the monthly total number of
tweets (a) and unique users (b) observed in the Qatar “twee-
tosphere”. The blue curves represent the trends of all the
tweets posted while the green curves represent environment
related tweets only. To ease the reading, the y-axis is plotted
in log scale. The ﬁrst striking observation is that even in log
scale, users’ activity around environmental topics ﬂuctuates
a lot compared to the smooth general discussions on Twitter.
Most of the spikes observed in Fig 2(a) can be explained by
looking at the tweets posted around the spike period. For in-
stance, one of the most noticeable burst, the one happening
in November-December 2012 is a response to the Confer-
ence of the Parties (COP18) that took place at Qatar late in
2012. That conference to which more than 50 presidents
from around the world took part received a large news cov-
erage locally and internationally. Yet, people living in the
small peninsula of Qatar have extensively experienced the
conference as it has directly impacted their everyday life in
terms of commute deviations, security enforcement, and ac-
cess limitations to some hotels. All this has generated an
unprecedented excitement on Twitter for the event. This ob-
servation is corroborated by Fig 2(b) in which it is easy to
see the important burst of the number of unique users who
took part of discussions and debates around COP18 con-
ference. The second sharper spike that takes place around
March 2015 is due to a sudden strong sandstorm that hap-
pened in Qatar in that same period, causing schools and in-
stitutions to close doors on that day as it was almost impos-
sible to drive. As an example, the below-mentioned tweet
is posted by Qatar’s Ministry of Interior on 1st April 2015
3: “Visibility is almost zero in all roads inside and on high-
ways. Motorists are requested to follow safety instructions.
#MoI Qatar.”

Continuing further with the temporal analysis of our set
of tweets, we plot in Figure 3 the breakdown of this trend
into different topics by providing the daily time series of
the number of tweets associated with each topic. The ﬁrst
ﬁgure to the left (Global) plots the daily time series of all
environment-related tweets. Some observations can be done
here. First, the different topics vary a lot in terms of volume
and trends. As highlighted in Table 1, the sandstorm topic
seems to overtake all other topics. It is clear that this topic
constitute the most discussed environment related topic on
Twitter by the people of Qatar as this has a direct and imme-
diate impact on their lives. The ﬁgure shows also that when
the people of Qatar discuss about environment on Twitter, it
is mostly about Politics&Opiniom, Negotiations&Summits,
and climate change in general. The less covered topics in-
clude Oceans&Water, Arctic and surprisingly Air Quality.

Figure 2: Monthly volume of the total number of tweets
and unique users in log scale in Qatar from January 2011
to January 2016. We see that climate change curves present
a noticeable variance over time unlike the general smoother
Twitter pattern.

Second, one can easily see that topic time series follow dif-
ferent trends. Indeed, while some topics such as Economic
and Energy maintain a decent level of activity throughout
the years, other topics such as Negotiations&Summits and
Arctic are sparse and only acquire users’ attention when a
related event happens.

Content Analysis
In order to visually inspect the content of tweets in differ-
ent topics, we plot Figure 4 in for each topic, we gener-
ate its word cloud of the most frequent hashtags mentioned
in the corresponding tweets. The font size of hashtags is
proportional to their frequencies in different topics. These
word clouds reveal for instance that the hashtag #COP18
is dominating in our dataset of tweets (global word cloud)
and is obviously dominating in tweets belonging to Nego-
tiations&Summits. We also found the hashtags #environ-
ment, #climate, and #carbon to be dominating in Economy
and Energy as #carbon is relevant to both topics (the carbon
economy). #environment dominates also Ocean&Water and
Agriculture&Forestry, #climate dominates in Weather, #ac-
tonclimate dominates in Campaigns, #climatechange domi-
nates in Arctic, and #airpollution dominates in Air Quality.
To further analyze the content, we focused on the relation-
ships between hashtags within topics and we built the co-
occurrence networks of hashtags for the tweets of each topic.
Because the generated networks were dense, it was not pos-
sible to perform any kind of visual observations on them.
Thus, we apply the backbone extraction algorithm explained
in the method section on all generated graphs. The algorithm

removes all noisy edges from the input graph and retains
only relevant once. Figure 6 plots the backbone networks
of each topic. We use Gephi4 tool to draw the graphs. Col-
ors in the graphs correspond to the different communities of
hashtags identiﬁed by Gephi’s internal modularity detection
algorithms. The ﬁrst graph (Global) is generated using all
the climate change related hashtags. We clearly see the ex-
istence of four big communities of hashtags around: #envi-
ronment, #climatechange, #qatar. Interestingly, we see that
the #climatechange community includes two heavy nodes:
#cop18 and #cop21. While #cop18 is heavily connected to
the community around #qatar just as the other hashtag #doha
(the capital), #cop21 (which happened this year in Paris)
does not seem to be connected to Qatar. As the other COP
editions didn’t attract media’s attentions comparing to the
above-mentioned ones, our study dataset reﬂects the same
pattern.

The backbone network corresponding to general topic is
nicely clustered too.
In fact, it has a giant component of
hashtags around #climatechange and a small yet accurate
one around #drought containing hashtags such as: Califor-
nia, Haiti, Somelia, rain, and water. All these hashtags
are related in a way or another to drought. The absence
of rain and water are the main causes of drought, and the
mentioned countries and cities are the ones that are strug-

4http://gephi.org, last accessed on Feb, 2016

gling with ongoing drought. Negotiations&Summits net-
work is also very informative. The modularity detection
algorithm used was able to partition the network into four
main communities: #cop17, #cop18, #cop19, and #cop21,
with a high polarization around #cop18 (Doha) and #cop21
(Paris) which are both associated with some distinctive hash-
tags.
Interestingly one can easily see that COP17 (Dur-
ban, South Africa), COP19 (Warsaw, Poland) and COP20
(Lima, Peru) did not attract as much attention as COP18
(Doha, Qatar) and COP21 (Paris, France) if not at all. While
COP18 is heavily covered for obvious reasons, we believe
that the Paris’ COP21 local attention is mainly due to the
fact that Paris was already catching the worldwide attention
for the sad Paris attacks event that happened two weeks be-
fore the start of COP21 5, thus beneﬁting from a large in-
ternational media coverage that was already in place. It is
also interesting to see that both conferences are associated
with distinctive sets of hashtags. For instance, COP18 is as-
sociated with hashtags such as #climatelegacy, #kyoto, #no-
justicenodeal, #ethiopia, and #philippines whereas COP21
is associated with hashtags such as #climatejustice, #car-
bon, # renewables, #climateﬁnance, #energy, #morocco, and
#china. Interestingly, the hashtag #Aljazeera which refers to
the name of the famous Qatar-based media network appears

Politics&Opinion backbone network
presents an interesting topology with a strong emphasize on
#environment which is linked to three smaller communities:
#qatar, #climate, and #waste (represented in blue). The re-
maining graphs are self-explanatory. However, it is worth
notice that the relatively small networks of Oceans&Water
and Risk&Disaster have only one community. Arctic and
Air Quality networks are not represented here because the
former returned an empty backbone graph whereas the latter
had only two nodes, namely: #airpollution and #health.

Environment-aware users
After our content-centered analysis, we work on analyzing
users. We use Users endpoint of Twitter API to request the
proﬁles of 8K users who posted at least one tweet about en-
vironment. Each user proﬁle comes with basic information
such as id, screen name, full name, bio and some statistics
about the number of posts, followers, and friends. We an-
alyze the proﬁles of users, particularly their self-identiﬁed
biographies. Notice that while not all users provide a biog-
raphy in their proﬁles, most of them do. Our objective is to
get insights into the interests of users who tweet about envi-
ronment and climate change. Thus, we merged all users’ bi-
ographies into one ﬁle and perform some cleaning tasks such
as the removal of Arabic and English stop words. We show
in Figure 5 the most frequent 50 terms found in the biogra-
phies of top 1% (a), top 5% (b) most tweeting users, and that
of all users (c). Unsurprisingly, the more users who tweets
about climate change, the more likely they mention a climate
change related term in their biographies. In other words, this
means that proliﬁc users in our dataset (top 1%) are deﬁ-
nitely environmental activists who identify themselves with
words such as: climate, change, development, environment
and sustainable. The second tier of users (top 5%), present
a media and news oriented proﬁles. These users mention
in their biographies words such as: news, views, journalist,
aljazeera (which is one of the biggest news groups in the
world). When all the users are taken together, all signals re-

ferring to climate change fade out. In fact, at scale, we found
that more than half of user users (51.08%) have tweeted only
once about climate change in a course of 5 years (2011 -
2015). These users tend to mention broader topics in their
biographies such as: love, life, world, etc. Notice that the
word Qatar has been removed from all three word clouds
as it dominated all of them. Figure 5(d) plots the comple-
mentary cumulative distribution function for the probabil-
ity (y-axis, log scale) that a random user would post more
than a given number of tweets (x-axis). The ﬁgure shows a
rapidly decreasing trends with most users posting only one
tweet, and very few (p=0.005) who posted a hundred tweets
or more.

Correlations
The correlation analysis performed on the 18 variables (11
UN climate change topics, 2 Qatar speciﬁc topics, and 5
weather measurements) revealed the existence of a signif-
icant dependency between some of them. Figure 7 shows
the Pearson correlation score computed over the daily time
series of all the pairs.

Looking solely at correlations between climate change
topics, we ﬁnd that Politics&Opinion and Negotia-
tions&Summits achieve the highest correlation score of ρ =
0.73. This deﬁnitely makes sense as many political activities
and “pourparlers” take place during the negotiations. The
second and third highest correlation scores are achieved be-
tween Politics&Opinion and Economy (ρ = 0.62) and Poli-
tics&Opinion and Energy (ρ = 0.61). This is also expected

conference, suggesting that organizing big events is not
enough to raise any lasting public awareness toward climate
change. The backbone graph analysis on the other side, has
shown that hashtag co-occurrence is not random and leads
in most of the cases to meaningful connected communities
(clusters of hashtags).

The ﬁndings of this paper did not just highlight interesting
answers on public’s opinion about climate change in Qatar,
but also raise questions for future research to explore. First,
we would like to alleviate the limitation of keyword based
ﬁltering by designing a better classiﬁer that accounts for se-
mantics of tweets. Second, we aspire to complement this
work with a longitudinal analysis of causality between dif-
ferent climate change topics using transfer of entropy tech-
nique. Finally, we would like to extend this study to other
countries in the region and examine the geographical inﬂu-
ences on public’s opinion about climate change.

as politics is tightly related to the two aforementioned topics.
Overall, one could easily see that the topics General, Negoti-
ations&Summits, Politics&Opinion, Economy, and Energy
constitute a well correlated group. Expending our analysis to
include the weather variables, we ﬁnd that Sandstorm topic
showed some signiﬁcant positive dependencies with mean
wind speed (ρ = 0.21) and a negative correlation with visi-
bility (ρ = −0.14). Thus, the lower the visibility, the more
likely a sandstorm is going on, which means more people are
tweeting about it. The other low yet statistically signiﬁcant
correlation is observed between Negotiations&Summits and
mean temperature (ρ = −0.1) which is simply explained
by the fact that the most important summits captured in our
collection (COP18, COP21) took place in winter time.

Conclusions and Future Work

In our study, we start by monitoring, collecting, ﬁltering, and
analyzing a large dataset of 109 millions tweets posted by
98K distinct users, in a course of 9 years in order to capture
the public interest in climate change. We use a taxonomy of
climate change to classify a signiﬁcant amount of relevant
tweets into different topics covering a wide range of issues
such as politics, economy, and air quality. We perform dif-
ferent types of analysis to understand and reveal the timely
distribution of public interest toward different topics.

In our examination of the relevant sub set of tweets, the
results revealed that people’s interest is mainly driven by
widely covered events (e.g., Paris COP21), or local events
that have a direct impact on users’ daily life (e.g., sand-
storms, Doha COP18). The number of users who engage
in climate change discourse does not seem to be on a in-
creasing trend. Our analysis revealed that the burst in users’
activity observed during COP18 has quickly fade out after
