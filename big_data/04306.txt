Abstract

We present precise lattice computations for the b-quark mass, the quark mass ratios mb/mc and mb/ms
as well as the leptonic B-decay constants. We employ gauge conﬁgurations with four dynamical quark
ﬂavors, up/down, strange and charm, at three values of the lattice spacing (a ∼ 0.06 − 0.09 fm) and
for pion masses as low as 210 MeV. Interpolation in the heavy quark mass to the bottom quark point is
performed using ratios of physical quantities computed at nearby quark masses exploiting the fact that
these ratios are exactly known in the static quark mass limit. Our results are also extrapolated to the
physical pion mass and to the continuum limit and read: mb(MS, mb) = 4.26(10) GeV, mb/mc =
4.42(8), mb/ms = 51.4(1.4), fBs = 229(5) MeV, fB = 193(6) MeV, fBs/fB = 1.184(25) and
(fBs/fB)/(fK/fπ) = 0.997(17).

1 Introduction

Lattice QCD simulations constitute the current dominant theoretical framework for high-precision B-
physics computations which are necessary, in combination with experimental results, to obtain precious
information in quark sector phenomenology. In fact increasingly improved computations of matrix ele-
ments (decay constants, form factors and mixing parameters) are of high importance to carry out chal-
lenging tests of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) paradigm, an effort also stimulated by the
ambitious prospect of discovering footprints of New Physics effects. Moreover lattice methods are opti-
mal to determine the quark masses by confronting experimental quantities from spectroscopy with their
theoretical counterparts computed from ﬁrst principles via lattice QCD simulations.

We should stress that although direct lattice simulations are not yet possible at the physical value
of the b-quark mass due to computing power limitations, the combined use of effective theories and
improved lattice techinques has progressively led to results that are characterised by much reduced and
reliable systematic uncertainties.

In the present paper we have carried out a non-perturbative determination of the b-quark mass as
well as its ratios to the charm and the strange quark mass. The latter turn out to be very accurate because
the renormalisation scheme dependence is absent and the systematics related to the lattice scale deter-
mination are suppressed. We observe that a precise b-quark mass evaluation is important for reducing
the uncertainty in the study of Higgs decays to b¯b [1] and possibly unveal non-SM features of the H-b-¯b
coupling.

In this paper we have also computed the pseudoscalar B-decay constants fBs and fB as well as their
(SU(3)-breaking) ratio, fBs/fB. Currently there is high experimental interest by LHCb and B-factories
in the processes B(s) → µ+µ− [2] and B → τ ν [3, 4] for the full description of which the knowledge
of the aforementioned decay constants is indispensable. The importance of B-decays is not limited only
to their crucial contribution for improving the accuracy of the unitarity triangle determination; in fact
B-decays in channels that are loop suppressed in SM are some of the ﬁrst-class candidates for revealing
features of beyond the Standard Model (SM) dynamics.

In our lattice computation we have used Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical quark gauge conﬁgurations
generated by ETM Collaboration [5,6] at three values of the lattice spacing. Our results are extrapolated
to the continuum limit. For the determination of the B-physics observables we have employed the ETMC
ratio method that has already been applied within the Nf = 2 lattice simulations framework [7–9]. In
particular in the present paper we have brought about improvements of the ratio method implementation
thanks to which it is possible to gain better control on various sources of systematic uncertainty.

The plan of the paper is the following. We describe our computational setup in Section 2.

In
Section 3 we present an improved implementation of the ratio method in the cases of the determination
of the b-quark mass, its ratios to the charm and strange quark masses, and the pseudoscalar B-decay
constants. We also give a detailed error budget for each one of the observables studied in the present
work. Finally in Section 4 we compare our results with the ones provided by other lattice collaborations.
For the interested reader, recent reviews on B-physics lattice computational methods, techniques and
collection of results are given in Refs. [10–13]. Recent non-lattice results can be found e.g. in Refs. [14–
16].

2.1 Lattice action setup

In our computation we employ Iwasaki glue [17, 18] and a mixed lattice fermionic action setup. The
sea quark action for the light mass-degenerate sea quark doublet, S(cid:96), and the action for the strange and
charm quark doublet, Sh ( [19, 20]) read, respectively,

where ∇µ and ∇∗
µ represent the nearest neighbour forward and backward covariant derivatives and it is

the quark doublet ψ(cid:96) = (ψu ψd)T while µ(cid:96) denotes the light (sea) twisted quark mass.
In Eq. (2)
ψh = (ψs, ψc)T denotes the strange-charm fermion doublet while µσ and µδ are the bare twisted mass
parameters from which the renormalized (sea) strange and charm masses can be derived. Pauli matrices
in Eqs (1) and (2) act in ﬂavor space. For more details on the twisted mass setup we refer the reader to
Refs. [5, 6, 19–23].

In the valence sector we employ the Osterwalder-Seiler (OS) action [24] which is written as the sum

Valence and sea quark masses are matched to each other and ﬁxed in terms of meson masses in order to
ensure unitarity in the continuum limit. Lattice artifacts in physical observables are just O(a2) [19, 25].

2.2 Simulation parameters and correlation functions

We have used the Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 gauge ensembles generated by the ETM Collaboration [5, 6]. A
summary of the most important details of our simulations is given in Table 1.

Simulation data have been taken at three values of the lattice spacing, namely a = 0.0885(36),
0.0815(30) and 0.0619(18) fm, corresponding to β = 1.90, 1.95 and 2.10, respectively (see Ref. [26]).
In our simulation the light valence and sea quark masses are set equal, leading to pion masses in the range
between 210 and 450 MeV. Strange and charm sea quark masses are chosen close to their physical value
and ﬁxed from MK and MDs inputs (see Ref. [26]). To allow for a smooth interpolation to the physical
values of the valence strange and charm mass as well as for heavier quark masses, we have inverted
the heavy valence Dirac matrix for three values of the strange-like quark mass, µs, and a number of
charm-like and heavier quark mass, aµc − aµh.

We have ﬁxed the lattice scale using fπ. The u/d, strange and charm quark masses have been
determined comparing lattice data with the experimental values of the pion, K and D(s) meson mass,
respectively. Further details can be found in Ref. [26]. The use of the mixed action of twisted mass and
OS quarks offers the advantage that the masses of light quarks in the sea and of all types of quarks in the
valence are multiplicatively renormalised via the renormalisation constant (RC) Zm = 1/ZP . The latter

is computed nonperturbatively using the RI -MOM scheme (for the RC determination see Appendix A of
Ref. [26]). Moreover, exact chiral lattice Ward-Takahashi identities imply that at maximal twisted angle
no normalisation constant is needed in the computation of decay constants [19, 27].

In two-fermion correlation functions valence light and strange-like quark propagators have been
calculated with the “one-end” trick stochastic method [28, 29] by employing spatial stochastic sources
at a randomly chosen time-slice. However for propagators of the charm or heavier quark, in order to get
suppressed contribution of the excited states in the correlation functions, we have employed Gaussian
smeared interpolating quark ﬁelds [30]. For the values of the smearing parameters we set kG = 4 and
NG = 30. In addition, we apply APE-smearing to the gauge links [31] in the interpolating ﬁelds with
parameters αAP E = 0.5 and NAP E = 20. Smearing leads to improved projection onto the lowest energy
eigenstate at small Euclidean time separations. We have implemented smeared ﬁelds in both source and
sink. We have thus evaluated two-point heavy-light correlation functions made up by the four possible
combinations of local/smeared source/sink. We can thus employ the GEVP method [32] to compute the
ground state pseudoscalar masses. For the pseudoscalar decay constant calculation we evaluate two point
correlation functions with pseudoscalar interpolating operators P (x) = q1(x)γ5q2(x). The typical form

We set opposite Wilson parameters, rf , for the two valence quarks that form the pseudoscalar meson.
This choice guarantees that the cutoff effects on the pseudoscalar mass are O(a2µq) [19, 33, 34]. We
consider two cases, using smeared source only and source and sink both smeared, for which ξP P is given
by ξP P = (cid:104)0|P L|ps(cid:105)(cid:104)ps|P S|0(cid:105) in the ﬁrst case and ξP P = (cid:104)0|P S|ps(cid:105)(cid:104)ps|P S|0(cid:105) in the second one,
where L and S indicate local and smeared operators, respectively. From the combination of the two
kinds of correlators it is easy to get the matrix element of the local operator, namely, gps = (cid:104)0|P L|ps(cid:105)
which, via PCAC, allows for the computation of the pseudoscalar decay constant:

where µ1,2 are the masses of the valence quarks entering the pseudoscalar meson mass Mps. In Eq. (5)
the use of sinh Mps rather than Mps turns out to be advantageous for getting reduced discretisation errors.
In Fig. 1 we illustrate the beneﬁcial effect of smearing in determining the ground state signal at early
time distance and making possible the decay constant evaluation for values of the heavy quark mass for
which it fails if local interpolating ﬁelds only are used. In the ﬁgure we show the results at β = 1.95 and
aµsea = aµ(cid:96) = 0.0035 obtained for the heavy-light effective mass versus the Euclidean time separation
(left panel) and the decay constant versus the heavy quark mass (right panel) using either only local or
appropriate combinations of local and smeared interpolating ﬁelds.

Statistical errors on pseudoscalar meson masses and pseudoscalar decay constants have been esti-
mated with the jackknife procedure. Autocorrelation is taken into account using the blocking method.

ﬁguration ensemble. Notice also that the RC computation has been performed on separate (i.e. totally
uncorrelated to the Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 sets) Nf = 4 gauge conﬁguration ensembles (for details see Ap-
pendix A of Ref. [26]). Moreover, from the comparison of results obtained at the same lattice spacing
(β = 1.90) and light quark mass (µsea = 0.0040) but on different lattice volumes (243×48 and 323×64)
we notice no signiﬁcant ﬁnite volume effects on the values of all observables relevant for this study. Note
that ﬁnite size effects are expected to be maximal correspondingly to the L = 24, µ(cid:96) = 0.0040 ensemble
as it has the smallest value of (MpsL) among those we have considered (see Ref. [26]).

3 Analysis and results

For the determination of the B-physics quantities we have used the ratio method already applied in
the Nf = 2 framework [7–9]. The main idea can be summarized in three steps. The ﬁrst one is the
calculation of the values of the observables of interest at heavy quark masses around the charm scale, for
which relativistic simulations are reliable (i.e. they produce results with well controlled discretisation
errors). The second step consists in evaluating appropriate ratios of the observables at increasing values
of the heavy quark mass up to a scale of 2-3 times the charm quark mass (i.e. around 3 GeV). The key
point is that the static limit of the measured ratios is exactly known from HQET arguments. The ﬁnal
step of the computation consists in smoothly interpolating data from the charm region to the inﬁnite mass
point and extracting their values at the b-mass.

The great computational advantage of this method is that one is able to make B-physics computa-
tions using the same relativistic action setup with which the lighter quark computations are performed.
Moreover an extra simulation at the static point limit is not necessary, while the relevant exact informa-
tion about it is incorporated in the construction of the ratios of observables.

It should be stressed that the use of ratios of observables drastically reduces the discretisation errors
and at the same time leads to a great suppression of the uncertainties that come from the QCD matching
to HQET. Furthermore the impact of possible (residual) effects of both types of systematic uncertainty on
the ﬁnal results can be controlled by employing appropriate variants of the ratio deﬁnition (see below).
First preliminary analyses for the decay constants and the b-quark mass with Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 gauge

ensembles have been presented in Refs. [35, 36], respectively.

In the following sections we present our B-physics analysis where we have made use of improved
variants of the ratio method that allow for better control over three main sources of systematic uncertainty,
namely, those due to discretisation, lattice scale determination and the ﬁtting procedure related to the b-
point interpolation.

3.1 Bottom quark mass and bottom to charm/strange quark mass ratios

At each value of the lattice spacing and sea quark mass ensemble we build the quantity

Qm ≡

Mhs

(Mh(cid:96))γ(Mcs)(1−γ)

,

(6)

where Mhs and Mh(cid:96) are the heavy-strange and heavy-light pseudoscalar masses, respectively, while we
denote by Mcs the mass of the pseudoscalar meson made out of a charm and a strange quark. The pa-
rameter γ, not subject to tuning, may take values, typically, in the interval [0, 1). We note that employing
the dimensionless quantity Qm(µh) of Eq. (6) in our analysis we gain large cancellations of the lattice

with n = 2, 3, . . . and we have used the relation µpole
h = ρ(µh, µ) µh(µ) between the MS renormalised
quark mass (at the scale µ) and the pole quark mass. The factors ρ’s are known perturbatively up to
N3LO [37–41]. For each pair of heavy quark masses we then carry out a simultaneous chiral and contin-
uum ﬁt of the quantity deﬁned in Eq. (8) to obtain yQ(µh) ≡ yQ(µh, λ; µu/d, µs, a = 0). By construction
this quantity involves (double) ratios of pseudoscalar meson masses at successive values of the heavy
quark mass, so we expect that systematic uncertainties due to the use of the perturbative factors ρ(µh, µ)
as well as discretisation errors will be quite suppressed2. In fact this is the case even for the largest values
of the heavy quark mass used in this work as it can be seen in the plot of Fig. 2(a). In Fig. 2(b) the scaling
behaviour of the ratios is shown at some intermediate value of heavy quark mass pair. Since in the quark
mass ratios of Eq. (8) we have taken account of the matching of QCD onto HQET, our ratio yQ(µh) has
been deﬁned such that the following ansatz is sufﬁcient to describe the µh-dependence of yQ

A detailed error budget is given in Table 2. The description of the various entries follows:

– “stat+ﬁt”: we gather the error coming from the statistical uncertainties of correlators, the interpo-
lation/extrapolation of the simulated quark masses to the physical values, the extrapolation to the
continuum limit, as well as the statistical uncertainties of the RCs. We here recall that statistical errors

different ways in which the cutoff effects are treated in the RI-MOM calculation (see Appendix A of
Ref. [26]). This amounts to about 1.4%. The second one is the difference (of about 0.8%) between the
result obtained through an analysis where data from the coarsest lattice spacing (β = 1.90) have been
excluded and the one that uses data from all three values of β. The two above systematic uncertainties
have been added in quadrature.

– “syst.

ratios”: we collect ﬁve different types of systematic uncertainties added in quadrature: (a)
systematic uncertainty, of about 0.7%, due to the choice of the parameter γ. In our analysis we have
employed the following values for the parameter γ = 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.60, 0.75, 0.90; (b) uncertainty
in tuning the value of the step λ to satisfy the chain equation (of about 0.3%); (c) in our analysis
we have made use of the NLL order formulae for the ρ’s while the use of LL or TL ones, thanks to
the fact that we work with ratios, would lead to a discrepancy of about 0.3% in the ﬁnal results; (d)
uncertainty of less than 0.1% on the ﬁnal result if we add to the ﬁt ansatz of Eq. (9) an extra cubic
term in 1/µh; (e) difference of the ﬁnal result with the one obtained by excluding from the analysis the
ratio corresponding to the heaviest quark mass pair (less than 0.1%). Let us stress that the freedom of
varying the value of the parameter γ ∈ [0, 0.9] in our analysis5, at the cost of a moderate increase of the
systematic error in the ﬁnal value, allows to gain conﬁdence in estimating the systematic uncertainties
due to discretisation effects and the use of the ﬁt ansatz given in Eq. (9).

– “syst. chiral”: it refers to the systematic uncertainty stemming from chiral extrapolation, which is
estimated as the spread between the result obtained from all data and the one computed using data
with pion mass smaller than 350 MeV.

– “RI(cid:48) - MS matching”: for this systematic error estimate, concerning the matching between the two
schemes at the typical scales the RCs are computed, we refer the reader to Appendix A of Ref. [26].

The (small) experimental error (of about 0.01% or less) on the values of the B(s) and Ds pseudoscalar
meson masses has a negligible impact on our error budget.

5Notice that in practice for γ ∈ (0.9, 1.0) it becomes difﬁcult to estimate the systematic uncertainty in the tuning of λ from

the chain equation (10).

the parameter γ ∈ [0, 0.9] and using M1- or M2-type quark mass RC. The maximum half-difference
between extreme values related to the investigation for each one of the sources of systematic error is
taken as our estimate of the corresponding systematic uncertainty. Systematic uncertainties are always
added in quadrature. Finally, we get:

mb(MS, mb) = 4.26(3)stat+f it(10)syst[10] GeV,

(11)

where the total error (in brackets) is the sum in quadrature of the statistical and the systematic ones.

3.1.1 Computation of mb/mc and mb/ms
The ratio method offers the advantage of determining the ratio mb/mc in a simple and fully non-
perturbative way. To this end we have to set the triggering point quark mass equal to the physical value
of the charm quark mass, µ(1)
h = µc. We then apply the ratio method employing the following quantity:

(cid:98)Qm =

Mhs
(Mh(cid:96))γ .

(12)

which, unlike the one deﬁned in Eq. (6), must be chosen dimensionful for ensuring charm scale depen-
dence at the triggering point. So by implementing a similar procedure to the case of the b-quark mass
it becomes possible to compute the b to c quark mass ratio directly from the relationship µb = λKµc.
The error budget is also given in Table 2. The various entries have a description similar to those for mb.
However there is an extra contribution under the name ”syst. trig. point”, which refer to the system-
atic uncertainty related to residual scale uncertainties in the computation of the (dimensionful) quantity

(cid:98)Qm at the triggering point. In the quark mass ratio computation the uncertainties due to the RC and

renormalisation scheme as well as the systematic lattice scale uncertainties cancel out.

Our ﬁnal result reads:

mb/mc = 4.42(3)stat+f it(8)syst[8],

where the total error (in brackets) is the sum in quadrature of the statistical and systematic ones.

Finally, by combining the result of Eq. (13) with the result

mc/ms = 11.62(16)stat+f it(1)syst[16]

presented in Ref. [26] we obtain the value for the bottom to strange quark mass ratio:

mb/ms = 51.4(1.1)stat+f it(0.9)syst[1.4],

(13)

(14)

(15)

where, again, the sum of the statistical and the systematic errors in quadrature give the the total error
(in brackets). The error estimate has been obtained assuming full correlation between the “stat+ﬁt”
uncertainties of Eqs (13) and (14), which thus have been added linearly, whereas systematic uncertainties
have been added in quadrature. Our result of Eq. (15) compares well with the (non-perturbative) result
mb/ms = 52.55(55) obtained by the HPQCD collaboration [44]. It is also in agreement with the Georgi-
Jarlskog prediction [45] that for certain classes of grand uniﬁed theories the ratio of b to s quark masses
should be equal to 3 mτ /mµ = 50.45.

(21)

The ratios zd, zs and ζ have by construction an exactly known static limit equal to unity. They also show
smooth chiral and continuum combined behavior. This is a consequence of the fact that zd, zs and ζ
(as it is also the case for the y ratios) are simply ratios of quantities evaluated at nearby values of the
heavy quark mass for which discretisation errors get suppressed. Figs 4(a) and 5(a) are two examples
illustrating the quality of the combined chiral and continuum ﬁts for zs and ζ respectively, at the largest
heavy quark mass values used in the decay constant analysis. See also the analogous Figs 4(b) and 5(b)
for the same quantities at intermediate values of the heavy quark mass pair. Notice that, since the cutoff
effects for the ratios are under good control, even for rather large values of the heavy quark mass pairs
the combined chiral and continuum ﬁts of ratios are reliable.

In Figs 6(a) and 6(b) we show the dependence of zs(µh) and ζ(µh) on the inverse heavy quark
mass, respectively. The ﬁt ans¨atze we have used are polynomial ﬁt functions in the inverse heavy quark
mass analogous to the one displayed in Eq. (9). For the case of the double ratio ζ(µh) we have also tried
a linear ﬁt in 1/µh where the exact condition limµh→∞ ζ(µh) = 1 is explicitly implemented.

The magnitude of the logarithmic term in this ﬁt depends on the value of ˆg. Given the form of Eq. (26)
we have used ˆg = 0.61(7) [42] since for this value we get the most conservative estimate for the ﬁt
systematic uncertainty.
As it can be noticed from Fig. 7(b) discretisation effects on Rf are small. Moreover, the two
estimates for the triggering point ratio at the physical light quark mass are compatible within less than two
standard deviations. So we take their average as our best estimate and we consider their half difference
as a systematic uncertainty.

The central values of fBs and fBs/fB have been obtained from the weigthed average over the
various estimates corresponding to the sets of values (µ(1)
h , λ, K, γ) employed in our b-quark mass anal-
ysis. The fB computation is carried out through the expression fB = fBs/(fBs/fB). We now give the
description of the full error budget for the decay constants, presented in Table 3:

– “stat+ﬁt”: this has been estimated along the same lines as for the b-quark mass.
– “syst. discr.”: it includes two sources of systematic discretisation errors, then added in quadrature.
Concerning the ﬁrst one we take into account the fact that for the decay constants computation at
the b-quark point we have collected as many estimates as there are the respective sets (µ(1)
h , λ, K, γ)
employed in our b-mass analysis. We then consider the maximum spread of these results from their
average (about 0.5% for fBs and 0.4% for fBs/fB). The second systematic error related to cutoff
effects has been estimated by investigating the impact of removing from our analysis the coarsest
lattice (β = 1.90) data. The maximum difference between results from the full data analysis and

for interpolating to the b-quark mass, (b) excluding the heaviest quark mass pair from our analysis
from NLL to LL. None of these tests
and (c) changing the perturbative order for the ρ’s and Cstat
gave a change to the values of fBs and fBs/fB larger than 0.3-0.4%. The ﬁnal estimates in Table 3
correspond to the sum in quadrature of the individual spreads due to (a), (b) and (c).

the chiral extrapolation systematic uncertainty, which we estimate from the spread of results obtained
from the two ﬁt ans¨atze of Eqs (25) and (26), and the error in the determination of fK/fπ; for the
latter we have used the value fK/fπ = 1.188(15) from Ref. [49].

4 Conclusions

Using the ratio method we have obtained non-perturbative results extrapolated to the continuum limit
for the b-quark mass and its ratio to the charm and the strange quark mass. Moreover we have evalu-
ated in the continuum limit the pseudoscalar B-decay constants, fBs, fB and their ratio as well as the
(double) ratio of the latter with fK/fπ. It is worth mentioning that the ratios between the SU(3) break-
ing ratios (fBs/fB)/(fK/fπ) computed in this paper and the one of (fDs/fD)/(fK/fπ) = 1.003(14)
determined in Ref. [49], are both perfectly compatible with unity within the errors, indicating, thus, an
almost negligible dependence on the quark mass. Our results, Eqs. (11), (13), (15) and (27) – (30), are
of high precision with well controlled systematic uncertainties. In Figs. 8 and 9 we compare our results
with the ones obtained by other lattice collaborations. Each panel includes determinations of the rele-
vant observable that are carried out in the continuum limit by using unquenched lattice simulations with
Nf = 2, 2 + 1 and 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical quarks.
