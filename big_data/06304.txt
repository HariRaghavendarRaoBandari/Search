Although organic heterojunctions can separate charges with near-unity eﬃciency and on a sub-
picosecond timescale, the full details of the charge-separation process remain unclear. In typical
models, the Coulomb binding between the electron and the hole can exceed the thermal energy kBT
by an order of magnitude, making it impossible for the charges to separate before recombining. Here,
we consider the entropic contribution to charge separation in the presence of disorder and ﬁnd that
even modest amounts of disorder have a decisive eﬀect, reducing the charge-separation barrier to
about kBT or eliminating it altogether. Therefore, the charges are usually not thermodynamically
bound at all and could separate spontaneously if the kinetics otherwise allowed it. Our conclusion
holds despite the worst-case assumption of localised, thermalised carriers, and is only strengthened if
mechanisms like delocalisation or ‘hot’ states are also present.

Although organic solar cells (OSCs) have the potential
to become low-cost renewable-energy sources, the precise
mechanisms of how they convert photoexcitations into
free charge carriers are not completely understood. The
eﬃciency of OSCs depends on the separation of the charge-
transfer (CT) state formed at a donor-acceptor interface
(Fig. 1), where the Coulomb binding energy between the
hole and the electron is

U (r) =

e2

4π0rr

,

(1)

where r is the distance between them, e is the elementary
charge, 0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and r is the
dielectric constant. Organic semiconductors have low
dielectric constants, r ≈ 2 − 4, meaning that a CT
state with a typical electron-hole separation of r = 1 nm
experiences a Coulomb binding of about 500 meV, much
greater than the thermal energy kBT = 25 meV [1].

How the charges overcome their strong Coulomb at-
traction and dissociate—sometimes with near-unity eﬃ-
ciency [2] and on a sub-picosecond timescale [3]—is un-
clear, although several theories have been proposed [3, 4].
For example, charge delocalisation could decrease the
Coulomb binding [5–10], while the excess energy of the
initially “hot” CT state could help the charges overcome
their attraction [8, 9, 11, 12]. Here, we extend the ear-
lier suggestion that entropy lowers the barrier to charge
separation [1, 13] to show that CT states can dissociate
eﬃciently simply by considering the role of entropy and
disorder.

It is conventionally assumed the charges are free if
U (r) < kBT , i.e., if their separation exceeds the Bjerrum
length

rc =

also referred to as the Coulomb capture radius. As On-
sager pointed out, this cutoﬀ between free and bound
charges is “somewhat arbitrary” [14], and here we provide
a more natural deﬁnition of a capture length.

Figure 1. Organic solar cells typically contain two materials, a
donor (usually a polymer) and an acceptor (usually a fullerene).
After an exciton (1) is formed by the absorption of a photon,
it diﬀuses to the donor-acceptor interface (2). Charge transfer
across the interface forms a charge-transfer state (3), whose
dissociation into free charges (4) is responsible for charge
generation. Arrows: as the charges move away from the
interface, they have access to more sites, increasing the entropy.

Onsager’s widely used theory [14, 15] assumes that the
electron relaxes at a thermalisation distance a from the
hole, which is to be compared to the Bjerrum length. For
a given a, the probability of escaping the Coulomb well
is exp(−rc/a) [15]. Thus, reducing rc increases the likeli-
hood of charge separation. However, at room temperature
with r = 3.5, the Bjerrum length is rc = 16 nm. This
value is large, and it is unlikely that charges will ther-
malise beyond 16 nm when the CT state is formed. By
contrast, experiments indicate that charges can separate
once they are 4 nm apart [16, 17].

Improvements to Onsager theory have taken into ac-
count the ﬁnite lifetime of the CT states, allowing multiple
attempts at dissociation [18–20]. However, they require
unrealistically long CT-state lifetimes to reproduce the
observed high yields—e.g., Braun’s theory requires CT-
state lifetimes in the microsecond range, in disagreement

DonorAcceptor44312with measured lifetimes, which are orders of magnitude
shorter [21].

The exp(−rc/a) behaviour of the dissociation probabil-
ity in the models above invites comparison [1, 13] with
the Arrhenius expression for a dissociation rate,

kd ∝ exp(cid:0)

−∆G‡/kBT(cid:1) ,

(3)

where the free energy of activation ∆G‡ is the energetic
barrier that the charges need to overcome in order to
separate, starting at their initial separation. The diﬃculty
is that if ∆G‡ is assumed to equal U (r) for a reasonable
initial separation, the prefactor in Eq. 3 would need to
be unphysically large.

Two theoretical groups have argued that entropy can
reduce the height of the potential barrier [1, 13] because
increasing the electron-hole separation r increases the
number of ways Ω(r) for the charges to be arranged,
thus decreasing the free energy. Clarke and Durrant [1]
showed that the entropic contribution to charge separation
was important because it has a similar magnitude to
the Coulomb binding energy. They modelled Ω(r) as
scaling as r3 due to their assumption that the electron can
occupy sites within a hemisphere centred on the stationary
hole. Gregg [13] also considered the entropy of charge
separation, but he modelled an exciton in a single material.
He recognised that Ω(r) should scale not with the volume
but with the surface area, because it counts the accessible
states when the electron and hole are restricted to be r
apart. For a given r, the electron can occupy sites on a

Figure 2. Counting states. The electron and the hole can be at
a distance r apart in many diﬀerent ways, all of which need to
be counted to determine the entropy of charge separation. At
each distance d between the hole and the interface, the electron
can be in a spherical-cap shell of radius r and width w (shown
in blue). The number of possible electron-hole conﬁgurations
is the sum of the volumes of all of the resulting spherical cap
shells as d varies from b/2 to r − b/2.

sphere centred at the hole, giving Ω(r) = 4π(r/a)2, where
a is the lattice constant. At a planar interface, the number
of states on a hemisphere would be Ω(r) = 2π(r/a)2.
Subsequently, observations that charges on an interface
between an organic semiconductor and vacuum can escape
the Coulomb barrier have been attributed to an increase
in entropy [22].

Here, we address two limitations of the previous models:
ﬁrst, we remove the assumed inability of the hole to leave
the interface and, second, we add disorder.

We model the organic semiconductors as a hexagonal
close-packed lattice with a site density of ρ = 1 nm−3 [1,
13], giving a lattice constant of a = (√2/ρ)1/3 = 1.12 nm.
Both the donor and the acceptor have r = 3.5 and the
temperature is T = 300 K. The electron and the hole
occupy sites on the lattice and start as a CT state at
the interface, with the hole in the donor and the electron
in the acceptor. The nearest-neighbour distance across
the interface (which is in the xy plane) is typically b =
1 nm [1], as in Fig. 2.

We consider the energetically ordered case before adding
disorder. Because of translational symmetry along x and
y, the CT state can be assumed without loss of generality
to initially be at the origin. Doing so eliminates two
degrees of freedom, so it is necessary to eliminate two
degrees of freedom from the separated charges as well.
We do so by ﬁxing the x and y coordinates of the hole,
allowing it to only move along z, as shown in Fig. 2.
Alternatively, the x and y coordinates of the centre of
mass of the separated charges could be ﬁxed.

For the charges to separate, either the electron or the
hole (or both) can leave the interface, meaning that al-
lowing only the electron to leave undercounts the number
of accessible states (this is so even if the electron is more
mobile than the hole, since entropy is a thermodynamic
quantity and not a kinetic one). Because all the site ener-
gies are the same at a given value of r, the ordered case
is easily discussed in the microcanonical ensemble, as was
done in refs. [1, 13]. For entropy to be properly deﬁned,
it should contain all contributions where the charges are
r apart, including when the hole is at diﬀerent depths,
d, into the donor. For a given d, the electron can oc-
cupy sites within a spherical-cap shell centred on the hole
and having the desired radius r. The number of possible
sites for the electron is proportional to the volume of
the spherical-cap shell: n(r, d, b) = 2πr(r − d − b/2)wρ,
where we assume the shell has width w = 1 nm. The total
number of accessible arrangements Ω(r) is the sum of
contributions from all the spherical caps as d varies from
b/2 (hole adjacent to the interface) to r − b/2 (electron
adjacent to the interface), i.e.,

with standard deviation σ [12, 23]. In the presence of dis-
order, electron-hole arrangements with equal separation
no longer have the same energy and their thermodynamic
properties are most easily calculated in the canonical en-
semble. For a system at constant temperature (and in
the absence of P V work) the free energy is

∆Gdisordered(r) = −(cid:104)kBT ln Z(r)(cid:105),

where (cid:104)·(cid:105) denotes averaging over the disorder ensemble (we
used 1000 realisations for each value of r). The partition

where the sum goes over all possible arrangements α of the

of arrangements (cid:98)Ω(r)(cid:99) is taken from Eq. 4 (and rounded
down) to ensure consistency with Eq. 5 in the ordered
limit σ = 0. The charge arrangements were determined
by selecting (cid:98)Ω(r)(cid:99) sites from the hexagonal close-packed
lattice closest to the corresponding spherical cap. The
energies Ee
α are the disordered site energies of the
electron and hole sites in arrangement α.

Including disorder signiﬁcantly reduces the free-energy
barrier, as shown in Fig. 4a. Disorder allows the charges
to separate more easily because they are more likely to
ﬁnd lower-energy sites at greater separations. Although
the amount of disorder depends on the material and its
preparation, our conclusions hold for disorder close to the
typical value of σ = 100 meV [1, 24, 25]. In that case, the
height of the energy barrier ∆G‡ ≈ kBT , meaning that
the thermal energy could facilitate charge separation (see
Fig. 3 for comparison with ordered models).

Spatial correlations in the energetic disorder were also
investigated to determine how local energetic smoothing
aﬀects the free energy of charge separation. The correlated
site energies ˜Ej were obtained by

N(cid:88)

˜Ej = N−1/2

K(rij)Ei,

(8)

i=1

where N is the number of sites within lc of site j and
the kernel K(rij) equals 1 if rij ≤ lc and 0 otherwise [24].
The factor N−1/2 ensures that ˜Ej also have standard
deviation σ.

The expression for the free energy ∆G(r) with corre-
lated disorder is the same as in the uncorrelated case,
except that the energies Ee,h
α in Eq. 7 are replaced with
their correlated counterparts ˜Ee,h
α .

As the correlation length lc of the energetic disorder in-
creases, the height of the free-energy barrier also increases.
Correlations create a more ordered energetic landscape,
decreasing the entropic contribution to the free energy,
as seen in Fig. 4c. The eﬀect of increasing correlations

Figure 3. The Coulomb potential U (r) and the free energy
of the charge-transfer state as a function of the electron-hole
separation r. ∆GGregg is the free energy in an energetically
ordered model with an immobile hole (proposed by Clarke and
Durrant [1], with a correction due to Gregg [13]). ∆Gordered
assumes both the electron and the hole are able to move, while
∆Gdisordered also includes energetic disorder with standard
deviation σ = 100 meV. Disorder greatly lowers the potential
barrier the charges need to overcome before separating. The
free-energy barriers ∆G‡ are free-energy diﬀerences between
r = 1 nm and r‡, the separation with maximum ∆G.

∆S(r) = kB ln Ω(r), the free energy is

∆Gordered(r) = U (r) − kBT ln Ω(r).

(5)

If the hole’s position is assumed to be ﬁxed [13], Ω(r)
scales as r2, whereas in the present model it scales as r3
due to the extra degree of freedom of the hole. Because
the entropy depends logarithmically on Ω(r), only the
scaling matters; prefactors do not contribute to changes
in entropy, meaning that it is not important to know ρ
and w precisely. The same reasoning implies that a planar
interface is a reasonable approximation, since changing
the curvature of the interface would mostly aﬀect the
prefactor, as opposed to the scaling.

An important consequence of introducing an entropic
contribution to the free energy is the appearance of a
maximum in ∆G(r) as shown in Fig. 3. The position r‡
of this maximum is a more natural deﬁnition of the radius
at which the electron and the hole separate than the
Bjerrum length rc, since the charges will spontaneously
move apart past r‡. In the energetically ordered case, if
Ω(r) ∝ rγ, then r‡ = rc/γ. With a ﬁxed hole, γ = 2
predicts r‡ = rc/2 ≈ 8 nm, whereas allowing the hole
to move reduces r‡ further to about rc/3 ≈ 5 nm (or
exactly rc/3 if the initial CT state separation distance is
0). Nevertheless, the barrier is still considerable, ∼ 7kBT .
OSCs are disordered materials and disorder can signiﬁ-

landscape predicts a lower barrier and a more realistic
barrier position compared to previous work. In particular,
our prediction of a small r‡ is consistent with the experi-
mental evidence that the charges separate when they are
about 4 nm apart [16, 17].

The ﬁnding that disorder enhances charge separation
is consistent with previous work indicating high charge
generation in OSCs with an energetically disordered inter-
face [26–28]. By contrast, in the bulk—once the charges
are separated—disorder reduces performance because it
increases the likelihood of charge trapping, thus decreas-
ing charge mobility and extraction [24, 27, 29].

We emphasise that our results concern the thermody-
namics of charge separation and not the kinetics and thus
cannot be used to calculate precise rates or eﬃciencies.
Indeed, a low or non-existent barrier to charge separa-
tion makes the Arrhenius equation (Eq. 3) inappropriate,
since a quasi-equilibrium between the reactants and the
transition state will not be established. Ultimately, the
eﬃciency of charge separation depends on the kinetic
competition between separation and recombination, and
our claim—that the Coulomb binding is not the dominant
barrier to charge separation—does not rule out other ki-
netic obstacles that might make separation slower than
recombination. In particular, we do not predict that all
disordered OSCs have high eﬃciencies, since eﬃcient sep-
aration requires not only a low barrier, but also a high
frequency of attempts to cross it. However, the insignif-
icance of the Coulomb barrier does mean, for example,
that attempts to improve charge yields by reducing the
Coulomb attraction—e.g., by changing r [30]—are, by
themselves, unlikely to result in the dramatic improve-
ments one would predict from Eq. 3.

Similarly, our model does not apply to exciton disso-
ciation in a single phase, where it might be expected
to predict high yields that are not observed.
In the
single phase, the exciton is not restricted to the inter-
face, so there is less entropy to be gained from charge
separation. In particular, the number of conﬁguration
would scales as r2 [13], instead of r3 when an interface is
present. More importantly, the recombination lifetimes
of CT states are much longer than exciton recombination
lifetimes [1, 31, 32], meaning that CT states have more
opportunities for dissociation, giving a higher eﬃciency.
Our assumption of localised charge carriers follow pre-
vious work [1, 13] and shows that our conclusions hold
in the worst-case model with the most strongly bound
charges. In reality, both charges are partially delocalised
[7, 8, 10, 17], which would make it even easier for them to
surmount the small barrier. Given that our model with
uncorrelated disorder σ = 100 meV predicts r‡ = 2 nm,
delocalised charges could well start oﬀ on the other side
of the barrier.

Our results show that entropy can drive charge sep-
aration in the presence of disorder even if the charges
are localised and thermally relaxed. For typical energetic

Figure 4. The eﬀect of energetic disorder on the free energy
of the electron-hole pair. (a) As the disorder σ increases, the
potential barrier decreases and, for σ (cid:38) 150 meV, disappears
altogether. Each value of ∆G is the mean of 1000 realisations
of the disorder. For clarity, selected standard deviations of
the distributions of ∆G are shown separately in (b). The
size of these standard deviations of ∆G are comparable to σ
indicating that—in particular realisations of the disorder—a
low-lying trap state can lower the free energy of its spherical
shell substantially below that of its neighbours, preventing
the charges from coasting apart down the free-energy slope.
(c) For increasing correlation lengths lc, the energy barrier
increases because correlations eﬀectively smooth the energetic
landscape, leading to a situation similar to having less disorder.
These results are for σ = 100 meV. lc = 1 nm does not produce
correlations because it is less than the lattice spacing.

is roughly equivalent to decreasing the energetic disor-
der, and so it is suﬃcient to know the eﬀective disorder
σ without needing to know the exact extent of spatial
correlation.

the height of the potential barrier to about kBT , allowing
for charge separation during the lifetime of the CT state.
Furthermore, our prediction of a small r‡ is consistent
with measured separation distances of about 4 nm [16, 17].
In the future, our estimates of barrier height will be re-
ﬁned by including delocalisation, morphological variation,
or interfacial factors such as diﬀerent dielectric constants
and interfacial dipoles [4]. However, since we started with
the worst-case model of localised, relaxed charges, addi-
tional enhancement mechanisms would only strengthen
our argument that there is no thermodynamic obstacle
to charge separation.
