Abstract

We report a comparative study of magnetic ﬁeld driven domain wall motion in thin ﬁlms made

of diﬀerent magnetic materials for a wide range of ﬁeld and temperature. The full thermally

activated creep motion, observed below the depinning threshold, is shown to be described by a

unique universal energy barrier function. Our ﬁndings should be relevant for other systems whose

dynamics can be modeled by elastic interfaces moving on disordered energy landscapes.

Domain walls are at the basis of future applications of high-density memories in ferromag-

netic materials [1]. In this type of memories data bits are built up of magnetic domains with

opposite magnetization varying in size and/or in position, and hence working memories im-

plies the displacement of domain walls. Noteworthy, even weak random pinning due to local

defects or inhomogeneities in the host materials is known to have a strong eﬀect on domain

walls [2]. Pinning tends to stabilize domain wall positions [3], introduces stochasticity [4],

induces domain wall roughness and dramatically modiﬁes the driven dynamics at small ﬁeld

and current [5–7]. A fundamental understanding on how weak disorder aﬀects the dynamics

of domain walls is thus critical for applications. This question is also particularly relevant

on a wider context since pinning dependent motion of elastic interfaces is observed in a large

variety of other systems such as ferroelectric materials [8], contact lines in wetting [9], crack

propagation [10], and earthquake models [11]. In all those systems, the competition between

the interface elasticity and pinning leads to rich and complex thermally activated motion

over eﬀective energy barriers (see Fig. 1) described by universal law [2, 12, 13]. Although

remarkable eﬀorts have been made in the last decades, a quantitative description of the

thermally activate regime of slow motion, so-called creep regime, has remained elusive.

An essential starting point to seize the universal character of the pinning dependent

motion is the zero temperature behavior (see Fig. 1A). For an elastic line driven by a force

f , a depinning threshold fd separates a zero velocity regime for f < fd from a ﬁnite velocity

regime for f > fd. A ﬁnite temperature value T results in a thermally activated subthreshold
creep motion with the velocity following an Arrhenius law v ∼ exp(−∆E/kBT ). For a near
zero driving force (f → 0), the motion of an elastic line requires to overcome a universal
divergent energy barrier presenting a power law variation ∆E ∼ f−µ. The universal creep
exponent µ presents a good agreement [5, 7, 14–19] with the predicted value (µ = 1/4),

for an elastic line moving in an uncorrelated disordered potential [20]. A more stringent

test of universality demonstrating a compatibility between universal scaling exponents and

dimensionality [20] was performed in ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt ultrathin ﬁlms [5, 14] but was

not yet reproduced for other ferromagnetic materials or other physical systems. Moreover,

(Top view) The out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld H favors the growth of up magnetization regions thus

Theoretically, the creep domain wall dynamics in a thin ﬁlm can be modeled by the displacement

of a one-dimensional elastic line coupled to an eﬀective two-dimensional random pinning energy

landscape V (x, z).

apart from the near zero drive creep (f → 0), the situation is much less clear and the nature
of the motion is not well established. Only numerically, minimal models [21] can be used to

test the universal character of domain wall motion. The experimental investigations often
go beyond the depinning transition [18] (f (cid:38) fd) and even reach the non-universal ﬂow
regimes independent of pinning and limited by dissipation [14, 22–24] (f (cid:29) fd). However,
thermally activated regimes with velocity-laws diﬀerent from the predicted creep law (∆E ∼
f−1/4) [13, 15, 18, 19] can be encountered. Hitherto, the issue of the universality of force-
driven elastic line creep motion for diﬀerent magnetic materials and other systems remains

open.

In this work, we address the question of universality from a study of magnetic ﬁeld

driven creep motion in magnetic ﬁlms with perpendicular anisotropy. In magnets, the elas-

tic interfaces are magnetic domain walls and the force f is proportional to the applied

ﬁeld H (see Fig. 1B). The ﬁeld-induced domain wall dynamics is studied in a single-

crystalline (Ga0.95,Mn0.05)(As0.9,P0.1) semi-conductor [25] and in an amorphous [Tb/Fe]5

ferrimagnetic [26] multilayer over a large range of temperatures. The observations are

3

compared with results published in the literature for ultrathin metallic ﬁlms (Pt/Co/Pt

[14, 18, 27], Au/Co/Au [28], and CoFeB([17]) which have polycrystalline or amorphous

structures. All these materials present speciﬁc structural and magnetic properties which

results in diﬀerent domain wall elastic energies and random pinning properties. Regard-

less of those diﬀerences, our comparative study shows that the creep domain wall dynamics

presents universal behavior.

The (Ga0.95,Mn0.05)(As0.9,P0.1) ﬁlm is a 12 nm thick semi-conducting ferromagnetic sin-
gle crystal. It was grown by low-temperature (T = 250◦C) molecular beam epitaxy on a
GaAs (001) substrate and was then annealed at T = 200◦C, for 4 h in air. Its Curie temper-
ature is 74±1 K. The multilayer ﬁlm Si3N4(11nm)/[Tb(0.8nm)/Fe(1nm)]×5 /Si3N4(11nm)
have been deposited on ﬂoated glass substrate using a reactive diode rf sputtering system.

Pure Tb, Fe, and Si targets were used and the pressure of 8 mTorr was regulated in the

chamber. The Si3N4 layer was obtained by pulsing a nitrogen partial pressure ﬂux main-

tained at 2 mTorr near the samples during the silicon deposition. The Curie temperature is
around 340K and no compensation is observed in the 270− 340K temperature range. In or-
der reach diﬀerent temperatures, we used an open cycle He cryostat for the (Ga,Mn)(As,P)

ﬁlm and a home-made variable temperature system for the TbFe ﬁlm. The motion domain

walls was observed in a MOKE microscope. Their displacement was produced by magnetic
ﬁeld pulses of adjustable amplitude and duration (1µs − 1s) applied perpendicularly to the
ﬁlms. The domain wall velocity is calculated by the ratio between the displacement and the

pulse duration. Velocity-ﬁeld characteristics observed for the (Ga,Mn)(As,P) and the TbFe

ﬁlms, reported in Fig. 2, are good illustrations of typical results reported in the literature

for the creep, depinning and ﬂow regimes [5, 13–15, 19, 24].

At low drives (H ≤ Hd, the depinning threshold Hd is indicated by black stars in Fig. 2),
domain walls follow the creep motion (see Figs. 2A and 2C). The velocity presents a strong

dependency on magnetic ﬁeld, varying over several orders of magnitude for a relatively

narrow applied magnetic ﬁeld range. Increasing temperature is found to shift the curves

towards low ﬁeld values, thus reﬂecting the strong contribution of thermal activation. The

ﬂow regime is characterized by a linear variation of the velocity which is seen at suﬃcient
large drive (H (cid:29) Hd) for the (Ga,Mn)(As,P) ﬁlm (see Fig. 2B). This non-universal regime
is controlled by material dependent microscopic dynamical structure of domain walls [24].

The ﬂow regime is only encountered in materials presenting a suﬃciently low depinning

temperature (10−65K for (Ga,Mn)(As,P) and 272−315K for TbFe) and magnetic ﬁeld ranges. The

creep regime is highlighted by a semi-log plot (curves A and and C). For both ﬁlms, the velocity

presents strong ﬁeld and temperature variations, as expected for a thermally activated process.

The linear ﬂow regime is clearly observed at large ﬁeld values (H > 10mT) for the (Ga,Mn,)(As,P)

ﬁlm (curves B) while it is beyond experimental reach for TbFe (curves D). The solid lines are ﬁts

threshold, like Pt/Co/Pt [14, 19], (Ga,Mn)As [13, 24], FeNi [29], Pt/Co/AlOx[30]. For

other materials as TbFe (see Fig. 2D) and Au/Co/Au ([28]), the ﬂow regime was never

observed experimentally. The depinning transition is manifested at intermediate drive (
H (cid:38) Hd). The cross-over between creep and depinning is found to occur for a Hd-value two
orders of magnitude higher for TbFe than for (Ga,Mn,)(As,P) (see Figs. 2B and 2D), thus

reﬂecting strongly diﬀerent material dependent pinning properties.

To go beyond this qualitative presentation, we propose to describe empirically the whole

with

∆E = kBTd

v(H, T ) = v(Hd, T ) exp

(cid:34)(cid:18) H

Hd

where kBTd is the characteristic pinning energy scale, and kB the Boltzmann constant.

Note that a similar empirical law was proposed in various theoretical works [31, 32].
It
is easy to see that Eq. 2 yields the creep law ∆E ∼ kBTd(H/Hd)−µ for H → 0 and a
linear vanishing of the energy barrier (∆E → 0) for H → Hd [31]. Each velocity-ﬁeld
characteristic was ﬁtted by Eqs. 1 and 2 (see [33]) in order to determine the parameters Hd,

v(Hd, T ), and Td. As reported in the supplementary material [33], the obtained values are

material and temperature dependent reﬂecting the microscopical origin of pinning [5, 18].

However a discussion on this non-trivial subject goes beyond the scope of this letter. As it

can be observed in Fig.2 and in the Figs. of the supplementary material [33], the ﬁtting of

the velocity-ﬁeld characteristics works particularly well for the whole creep motion for all

temperatures and materials.

Let us now address the question of the universality of domain wall dynamics. Once the

material dependent parameters are obtained, Eq. 1 can be used to deduce the pinning barrier

height ∆E from the velocity curves v(H, T ), i.e., ∆E(H) = kBT ln[(v(Hd, T )/v(H, T )].

In Fig. 3, the reduced energy barrier height (∆E/kBTd(T )) is plotted as a function of

the reduced force (H/Hd(T )) for the (Ga,Mn)(As,P) and TbFe thin ﬁlms, and three other

ferromagnetic materials.

As it can be observed, all the reduced energy barrier curves

∆E/kBTd(T ) collapse well onto a single master curve over the full ﬁeld-range of existence

of the creep regime 0 < H/Hd < 1. This is the central result of this letter. It demonstrates

that for magnetic materials the creep can be described by a unique energy barrier function,

extending from the divergent barriers dominated dynamics close to H = 0 to the regime
where the barriers vanish linearly (∆E ∼ (1/4)kBTd [H/Hd − 1]) approaching Hd. This
result is very robust since the master curve is obtained for a variation of the reduced energy

barrier heights (see inset of Fig. 3) over more than three orders of magnitude (∆E/kBTd =
10−3 − 5) and for an explored range of temperature of almost two orders of magnitude
(T = 10 − 315K). The quantitative agreement between Eq. 2 which was postulated 15
years ago as a possible interpolation formula and the experimental data, demonstrates that

energy barrier height ∆E/Ed, with Ed = kBTd, is reported as a function of the reduced force H/Hd,

for ﬁve diﬀerent magnetic materials and for temperatures ranging from 10 to 315 K (25 curves are

superimposed). The solid line is a plot of Eq. 2. The black circles correspond the predictions

of ref. [21] whose energy scale was adjusted to experimental data (see [33]). The dashed line

corresponds to the linear variation of the energy barrier close to the depinning ﬁeld (H = Hd).

the creep regime can be very well described by a unique (reduced) barrier function of the

(reduced) temperature and ﬁeld. Furthermore, it compares fairly well with the results

obtained by using numerical simulations [21] of a minimal model for a one-dimensional

elastic line in a two-dimensional disordered medium (see Fig. 3). As this model does not

take into account the properties of a speciﬁc system, the barrier function of the creep regime

is expected to be relevant for a larger variety of systems other than ferromagnets.

7

In conclusion, we provide evidence of the universal character of the whole thermally

activated subthreshold creep motion in magnetic thin ﬁlms. In this dynamical regime, the

magnetic domain wall motion is shown to be controlled by a unique universal reduced energy

barrier function. The compatibility of this universal law with the predictions of a minimal

model strongly suggests our results to be relevant to understand the creep dynamics in

other systems than magnetic thin ﬁlms whose emergent properties are also controlled by the

competition between quenched disorder and the elasticity of a driven ﬂuctuating string.
