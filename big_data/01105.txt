Abstract

We develop numerical tools and apply them to solve the relativistic Yang–
Mills–Higgs equations in a model where the SU (N ) symmetry is spontaneously
broken to its center.
In SU (2) and SU (3), we obtain the different field pro-
files for infinite and finite center vortices, with endpoints at external monopole
sources. Exploration of parameter space permits the detection of a region where
the equations get Abelianized. Finally, a general parametrization of the color
structure of SU (2) fields leads us to a reference point where an Abelian-like BPS
bound is reconciled with N-ality.

Introduction

Over the past years, many lattice studies have been oriented towards obtaining the
static potential from the Wilson loop average in pure Yang–Mills (YM) theories, for
quarks in different representations. Asymptotic linearity [1], string-like behavior [2],
and N -ality at asymptotic distances [3] are among the observed properties. This third
one refers to the fact that string tensions depend on how the center Z(N ) is realized
in a given SU (N ) quark representation.

Based on the idea of dual superconductivity [4]-[6], these properties have been ex-
plored by means of lattice calculations and effective models in a Higgs phase. In the
former, the possibility to capture the path-integral measure by quantum ensembles
of magnetic configurations is analyzed (see [7]-[16], and refs. therein). In the latter,
phenomenological dimensionful scales are introduced from the beginning, proposing
a dual superconductor where the confining string is a smooth vortex solution to the
classical equations of motion. This is a magnetic object in the dual description, that is
supposed to effectively represent the chromoelectric confining string. In this context,
gauge models based on the SU (N ) → Z(N ) spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)
pattern are attractive (see [17]-[20], and refs. therein). In this case, the manifold of
vacua is the coset M = SU (N )/Z(N ) = Ad(SU (N )) (the adjoint representation of
SU (N )), whose first homotopy group is Π1(M) = Z(N ). Then, the confining string
would be represented by a smooth center vortex, thus naturally leading to N -ality.
Furthermore, as noted in ref.
[21], the lack of isolated monopoles, due to the trivial
Π2 of the compact group Ad(SU (N )), can be interpreted as the absence of gluons in
asymptotic states. However, monopoles may interpolate center vortices with differ-
ent fundamental weights to form hybrid mesons, that is, a colourless quark/valence
gluon/antiquark confined state.

The detailed knowledge we have about interquark lattice potentials, for different
groups and representations, makes us wonder what the natural dual superconductor
could be. With this idea in mind, the initial objective of this work is to look for and
test appropriate numerical methods to solve the center vortex field equations. These
tools will permit, in a forthcoming work, to contrast different proposals with existing
lattice data, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. A part of the data could be
used to adjust the parameters, and then we could make predictions to be compared
with other data. This type of analysis has already been considered in refs.
[22]-[28].
[25]-[27], an Abelian Higgs model that essentially describes a condensate of
In refs.
Abelian monopoles was analyzed. For example, in ref.
[27], the internal structure of
the flux tube, within Abelian-projected SU (2) lattice gauge theory, sets the system
in the borderline between type I and type II superconductors. However, an Abelian
description cannot explain N -ality, nor related properties such as the lattice k-string
tensions, when N ≥ 4 [29]. In the case of SU (3), the fitted parameters in an effective

2

dual QCD model also led to a similar limiting behavior (see refs. [17] and [24]).

In the second part of this work, we show that there exists a choice of parameters, in
the model we proposed in ref. [21], where the center vortex field profiles for N = 2, 3
satisfy Nielsen–Olesen equations, thus conciliating Abelian-like behavior with N -ality.
Furthermore, in the SU (2) case, a BPS bound is obtained, showing the fundamental
BPS vortex is a minimum with respect to any, possibly non Abelian, field deformation.
This special point in parameter space will certainly serve as a place to start exploring
the model, and verify its suitableness to accommodate the various lattice data.
BPS bounds in a non Abelian context were previously obtained in the bosonic
sector of N = 2 supersymmetric theories. For the embedding of U (1)-vortices, a U (N )
gauge field coupled to one adjoint and N fundamental scalar fields was considered [30].
For relativistic center vortices, an appropriate limit in the parameters was needed for
the BPS equations to be compatible with those of the original theory [31].

2 The Yang–Mills–Higgs model
In order to drive SU (N ) → Z(N ) SSB, at least N adjoint Higgs fields ψI, I = 1, . . . , d,
d ≥ N , are required [32]-[35]. In this regard, a detailed analysis of the relation between
center vortex charges and magnetic weights, for different groups and representations,
was carried out in ref. [36].
gauge field Aµ and a set of SU (N ) adjoint Higgs fields, ψI ∈ su(N ),
(cid:104)Fµν, F µν(cid:105) − VHiggs(ψI) ,

A natural class of dual models was proposed in ref. [21]. They depend on a (dual)

L =

Dµ = ∂µ + gAµ ∧

where I is a flavour index, we defined X ∧ Y = −i[X, Y ], and the internal product is

(cid:104)X, Y (cid:105) = T r(cid:0)Ad(X)†Ad(Y )(cid:1), with Ad(·) a linear map into the adjoint representation.

Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ + gAµ ∧ Aν ,

,

The Higgs potential is constructed with the natural SU (N ) invariant terms, up to
quartic order,

(cid:104)ψI, ψJ(cid:105) , (cid:104)ψI, ψJ ∧ ψK(cid:105) , (cid:104)ψI ∧ ψJ , ψK ∧ ψL(cid:105) , (cid:104)ψI, ψJ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψK, ψL(cid:105) .

Within this class, we introduced a flavour symmetric model. To motivate that con-
struction, we recall that followed for a single SU (2) adjoint Higgs field ψ undergoing
SU (2) → U (1) SSB. This pattern is obtained from a Higgs potential whose vacua are
points on S2,

(cid:104)ψ, ψ(cid:105) − v2 = 0 .

3

A natural Higgs potential, with up to quartic terms, is then obtained by squaring the
vacuum condition,

(cid:0)(cid:104)ψ, ψ(cid:105) − v2(cid:1)2 .

VHiggs =

λ

Now, to get a flavour symmetric model with SU (N ) → Z(N ) SSB, we take d = N 2−1,
so that the range of the flavour index coincides with that of colour. Replacing I →
A = 1, . . . , N 2 − 1, we denote the Higgs fields as ψA and initially propose a Higgs
potential whose vacua satisfy,

ψA ∧ ψB − v fABC ψC = 0 ,

where fABC are structure constants of su(N ). The vacua are given by a trivial point
ψA = 0 plus a manifold of nontrivial vacua, where ψA form a Lie basis. Of course, the
space of vacua is invariant under the adjoint action of SU (N ) gauge transformations.
In addition, a given Lie basis is invariant under this action iff U ∈ Z(N ). Then,
a natural potential would be obtained by squaring the condition above. Using the
notation (cid:104)X(cid:105)2 = (cid:104)X, X(cid:105),

VHiggs =

λ
4

(cid:104)ψA ∧ ψB − fABC v ψC(cid:105)2 .

(2)

However, for this potential the trivial and nontrivial vacua are degenerate. This can
be lifted by initially expanding the squares and then introducing general couplings for
the quadratic, cubic an quartic terms,

VHiggs = c + µ2 I2 + κ I3 + λ I4 ,

I2 =

(3)

Besides being gauge invariant, this potential is flavour symmetric under Ad(SU (N ))
transformations, ψA → RAB ψB . The constant c is chosen in order for VHiggs to be zero
when the Higgs fields assume their asymptotic vacuum values. In this manner, the
asymptotic energy density of the vortex will tend to zero, and the total energy will be

2.1 The vortex between a monopole-antimonopole pair

We can consider a finite center vortex ending at an external monopole-antimonopole
pair, which in the dual model represents a quark and an antiquark. The pair is on the
x1-axis, with charges (cid:126)β and −(cid:126)β,1 and placed at x1 = −L/2 and x1 = +L/2. In the
presence of external monopoles, the energy functional is,

(cid:90)

E =

d3x (ρB + ρK + VHiggs) ,

ρB =

ρK =

(6)

where Jij represents a pair of Dirac strings, placed on the x1-axis, between the monopole
locations and infinity. The energy minimization gives,

Dj(Fij − Jij) = ig [ψA, DiψA] ,

DiDiψA = µ2ψA + κ fABC ψB ∧ ψC + λ ψB ∧ (ψA ∧ ψB) .

(7a)
(7b)

Let us consider a center vortex, ending at external monopole-like sources, with
fundamental weight (cid:126)β. Because of cylindrical symmetry, all field profile functions in
our ansatz are required to be ϕ-independent. The gauge field ansatz is,

Ai =

a ∂iϕ (cid:126)β · (cid:126)T ,

(8)

For SU (2) and SU (3), the weights are one and two-component tuples; they can be
chosen as (cid:126)β =

3/2, 1), respectively. For the Higgs fields, taking,

and using that, for the Cartan directions, STqS−1 = Tq, while, for the off-diagonal
ones,

S = eiϕ (cid:126)β· (cid:126)T ,

STαS−1 = cos((cid:126)α · (cid:126)β)ϕ Tα − sin((cid:126)α · (cid:126)β)ϕ T ¯α ,
ST ¯αS−1 = sin((cid:126)α · (cid:126)β)ϕ Tα + cos((cid:126)α · (cid:126)β)ϕ T ¯α ,

(10)

we propose the form,

• SU (2):

ψ ¯α1 = h ST ¯α1S−1 ,

ψα3 = h STα3S−1 ,
ψ ¯α3 = h ST ¯α3S−1 ,
√
Note that for SU (2) there is a single positive root α1 = 1/
2, so that the pair ψα1,
ψ ¯α1 rotates once when we go around the center vortex. On the other hand, in SU (3),
the three positive roots satisfy (cid:126)α1 · (cid:126)β = 1, (cid:126)α2 · (cid:126)β = 0, (cid:126)α3 · (cid:126)β = 1. Then, in this case
there is a pair ψα2, ψ ¯α2 that do not rotate, while the others rotate once. In both cases,
finite energy solutions require the asymptotic boundary conditions,

a → 0
a → 1

h → 0
h → v

, when |x1| < L/2 ,
, when |x1| > L/2 .

,

(18)
In this manner, the delta singularity in eq. (16), present for |x1| > L/2, is cancelled
against the Dirac string Jij, leaving an energy density contribution (1/4)(Fij − Jij)2
that is smooth everywhere. On the other hand, the profile functions h0, h1 and h2,
associated with Higgs fields that do not rotate, are finite on the x1-axis. They are not
required to vanish there.

Now, let us consider curvilinear coordinates ξ1, ξ2, ξ3 in R3, x = x(ξ). To represent
vectors A = Ai ei = Ai ei, we can use either covariant or contravariant basis vectors ei
or ei, with Cartesian components, ei|xj = ∂xj
∂ξi , ei|xj = ∂ξi
∂xj . The metric for contravariant

3.1

Infinite vortex

Let us initially consider the simpler case of an infinite vortex. In this way we can gain
a quick understanding of how the solutions behave under the variation of parameters,
and we can also check the suitableness of the numerical methods we will use. If the
quarks are infinitely far apart, the problem is invariant under translations along the
x1-axis. In addition, due to rotational symmetry in the (x2, x3)-plane, the problem

8

becomes purely radial (and thus one-dimensional), strongly reducing the difficulty
of the numerical energy minimization.
In this case, it is natural to use cylindrical
coordinates,

(29)

In this section we will focus on SU (2); the case of SU (3) is analogous, and will be
shortly touched upon in section 3.1.2. For SU (2), using eqs.
(24) and (27c), the
energy density per unit length takes the form,

(30)

(cid:19)

To minimize this functional, we will use a Fourier finite elements method. In short,
the procedure is as follows: Initially, we modify the problem until we have one on a
finite interval, with simpler boundary conditions, such that all unknown functions go
to zero at the boundaries. Next, we use a Fourier series to expand them. Cutting off
this series at a finite order, we plug the ans¨atze into the energy and minimize with
respect to the Fourier coefficients.
With this in mind, let us start by looking at the boundary conditions. When ρ → 0,
we must have a → 0, h → 0, and h1 regular. In this limit, assuming the leading term
of h is proportional to ρi, the equation for h yields at lowest order in ρ,

i(i − 1) + i − 1 = 0 ⇔ i = ±1.

The solution i = +1 satisfies the boundary conditions. Proceeding similarly with the
equation for a, one finds that the lowest order must be either ρ4 (in which case the
leading terms originating from a will cancel the one from the h2-term), or ρ2 (in which
case the leading terms from a cancel amongst each other and are of lower order than
that of h2). We can simply assume that the Taylor series starts with a term in ρ2,
as this will cover both cases. Finally, no condition on the leading-order term of h1 is
obtained, but it turns out that the term linear in ρ must vanish. We thus find the
following small ρ behaviors:

a(ρ) ≈ a2 ρ2 + a3 ρ3 + ··· ,
h(ρ) ≈ b1 ρ + b2 ρ2 + ··· ,
h1(ρ) ≈ c0 + c2 ρ2 + ··· ,

9

(31a)
(31b)
(31c)

where the dots simply continue the Taylor expansions.

When ρ → ∞, we need a → 1, h → v, and h1 → v. As the theory is massive, due
to symmetry breaking, we can expect the functions to reach their asymptotic values
exponentially fast. In particular, the asymptotic behavior of a is found to be

a(ρ) ∼ 1 + γ e−gvρ ,

with an undetermined constant γ. Therefore, let us introduce the variable t = tanh gvρ
with t ∈ [0, 1]. In this new variable, a will be linear when ρ → ∞ (and thus t → 1). In
general, the functions h and h1 will not have the same exponential factor at infinity,
but this will not cause any problems as long as the correct asymptotic value is reached:
their behavior will simply be nonlinear in t. It is easily seen that the small-ρ behavior
in (31) will still be valid with the replacement of ρ by t. In effect, we have the series,

t = gvρ +

(gvρ)3

3

+ . . . ,

with a vanishing second-order term, so the leading terms will remain leading, and the
linear term in h1 will still be absent.

Recapitulating, we can propose the ans¨atze

a(t) = t2 + tα(t) ,
h(t) = vt + η(t) ,

where α(t), η(t), and η1(t) are smooth functions in the interval t ∈ [0, 1], that vanish
at both t = 0 and at t = 1. Then, these new functions can be represented by means of
a Fourier series only in terms of sin nπt, n ∈ N\{0}. In other words, the most general
profiles can be expanded as,

with respect to the unknown coefficients. These steps can be easily performed using the
computer algebra package Mathematica. We would like to underline that it is not
necessary to transform the energy integral (30) to the new variable t, as we can simply
plug t = tanh gvρ into our ans¨atze and do the computations using ρ as a variable.

Figure 1 shows the results of the numerical minimization for a certain set of pa-

As mentioned before, the SU (2) and SU (3) cases are completely analogous. The main
difference is that there are two more unknown profiles, h0 and h2 (cf. eqs. (28a) and
(28b)), they behave exactly like h1 in eq. (31c). Figure 2 shows our results for SU (3);
again, convergence is quite good and only in the case of a do the approximations with
three or four Fourier modes noticeable differ from each other.

s1 = s2 = s =

(34)
Defining, σ = sinh ξ1 ∈ [0,∞), together with ξ2 = ν, and ξ3 = ϕ, the quark and anti-
quark are located at the foci described by σ = 0, ν = 0 and σ = 0, ν = π, respectively.
The line joining them is given by σ = 0, ν ∈ [0, π]. The semi-infinite lines extending
from x1 = L/2 to +∞ and from x1 = −L/2 to −∞, on the x1-axis, are given by
σ ∈ (0,∞), ν = 0 and σ ∈ (0,∞), ν = π, respectively.

Then, the asymptotic boundary conditions, when σ → ∞, are as follows,

L

a(σ, ν) → 1

h(σ, ν) → v

,

h1(σ, ν) → v .

The regularity conditions, when σ → 0, ν ∈ [0, π], are

a(σ, ν) → 0

h(σ, ν) → 0 ,

,

while for ν → 0 or ν → π, with σ ∈ (0,∞), we require,

a(σ, ν) → 1

h(σ, ν) → v .

Now, expanding around σ = 0 with ν-dependent coefficients, and around ν = 0 with
σ-dependent coefficients, we obtain,
a(σ, ν) ≈ a2(ν) σ2 + a3(ν) σ3 + ···
h(σ, ν) ≈ b1(ν) σ + b2(ν) σ2 + ···

and similar expressions around ν = π, in powers of (ν − π). Around the quarks,
the situation is more subtle. Setting σ = r cos α, ν = r sin α and considering series
expansions around r = 0, with α-dependent coefficients, we get,

These are L-independent divergences, which obviously correspond to the quark self-
energies. As usual, we will subtract them to get a finite total energy.
Now, we can follow a procedure similar to that used for infinite vortices. Initially,
we observe that, when σ → ∞, a behaves like ∼ 1 + γ(ν) e−Lgvσ/2. Then, introducing
the variable t = tanh Lgvσ/2, and defining,

f (σ, ν) =

h(t, ν) = vf (t, ν) + sin ν η(t, ν) .

a(t, ν) = f (t, ν)g(t, ν) + t sin ν α(t, ν) ,

(41a)
(41b)
The new unknown functions α(t, ν) and η(t, ν) are smooth in the region (σ, ν) ∈
[0,∞) × [0, π], and must vanish when either σ = 0, σ → ∞, ν = 0, or ν = π. In
terms of the variables (t, ν), they vanish on the border of the square [0, 1) × [0, π], so
they can be Fourier expanded in terms of the basis elements sin(nπt) sin mν, that is,

a(t, ν) = f (t, ν) g(t, ν) + t sin ν

anm sin(nπt) sin mν ,

h(t, ν) = v f (t, ν) + sin ν

(42)

Similarly, h1(t, ν) − v vanishes when t = 1, and is finite when either t = 0, ν = 0, or
ν = π, so it can be expanded in the basis (p, m ∈ Z),

which is one between the quarks, thus allowing to shift the value of h1 there, and zero
on the other three edges. We note that terms with even m, in the expansions for a
and h, and with odd m, in the expansion for h1, will always vanish due to reflection
symmetry through the (x2, x3)-plane.

Finally, minimizing with respect to the first several Fourier coefficients, we obtained
the profiles showed in Fig. 3. There, we can see a, h, h1, and the energy density,
in normal Cartesian coordinates (z, ρ) (the mesh lines on the plotted surfaces are
the elliptic coordinates used during the computations).
In this figure, we included
the Fourier coefficients a11, a13, a15, a21, a23, a31, b11, b13, b21, c0, c00, c02, and c10.
Rerunning the minimization but only including a11, a13, and a21 for a, keeping the
previous h and h1 coefficients, the results are almost unchanged. Figure 4 displays
(in percent) the relative errors defined as 2(amore − afew)/(amore + afew), with amore and
afew the approximation to a with more, respectively fewer, Fourier coefficients (and
analogously for h and h1). Applying these methods, we also obtained approximate
solutions in SU (3). In these initial computations, we included only the (1, 1) mode in
a and h, and only the mode multiplying k and the (0, 0) mode for h0, h1, and h2. The
first two profiles, a and h, are qualitatively similar to those obtained in SU (2), while
the last three are similar to h1.

4 A special point in parameter space

After developing appropriate numerical methods to solve the center vortex field equa-
tions, we have a tool that will permit to contrast the model with existing lattice data.
For this aim, we will also need some point in parameter space to start the search for
the best fit. In this respect, we recall that in ref.
[25], the adjusted parameters in
a dual Abelian Higgs model, when fitting the lattice interquark potential, turned out
to be quite close to the BPS point. Moreover, in ref.
[27], the internal structure of
the flux tube, within Abelian-projected SU (2) lattice gauge theory, was reproduced
by the dual Abelian lattice description. The masses of the dual gauge and Higgs fields
turned out to be quite close, again a typical property associated to a BPS point. In
both works, small deviations from this point favor a weakly type-I superconductor.
However, these Abelian descriptions cannot explain the observed N -ality of confining
strings. In this section, we will show how our effective model permits to reconcile both
properties at some special point in parameter space.

λ = 1, v = 2.87. The four cases correspond to µ = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, respectively. We
see that h1(ρ), the profile associated with the Higgs field along the Lie algebra con-
stant direction T1, tends to a constant function when µ → 0 (see Fig. 5)). Indeed, at
µ2 = 0, from eq. (4), we have v = −κ/λ (κ < 0), and it can be verified, not only for
SU (2) but also for SU (3), that eqs. (27b) and (28b) are satisfied by setting h1 ≡ v
and h0 = h1 = h2 ≡ v, independently of the form of h. That is, the field profiles for
the Higgs fields that are not required to vanish on the x1-axis become frozen at the
asymptotic value v. In addition, the equations for the profile h, namely eqs. (27a) and

(26), shows that, at µ2 = 0, a and h exactly satisfy the

As the equations for the non Abelian model get Abelianized, given that µ2 = 0,
we may wonder whether the model (with x1-translation symmetry) has a BPS point.
This would permit to discuss the stability of the fundamental vortex, showing these
solutions correspond to energy minima with respect to any physical, possibly non
Abelian, change. Such BPS bound would also be useful as the Abelianized equations
were obtained assuming cylindrical symmetry, on the other hand, the bound in the
non Abelian context would provide additional information. For example, at this point,
there would be no forces between center vortices. A BPS bound in the bosonic sector

[30] (see also the review [37], and
and N fundamental scalars, was obtained in ref.
references therein). The BPS solutions include not only Abelian vortices embedded in
the non Abelian description, but also monopoles attached to a pair of vortices.

For center vortices, the initial steps we shall follow are similar to those given in
ref. [38], where we obtained a BPS point in a model based on the Lagrangian (1), (3),
modified by the presence of a nonrelativistic term that tends to align ψ1 and B1 along
κ2
the same direction in the Lie algebra. In that case, we used the condition µ2 = 2
9
λ
(cf. eq. (3)), where the Higgs potential becomes the perfect square in eq. (2), and the
decrease in energy due to the alignment term led all BPS solutions to have zero energy.
Here, we shall consider µ2 = 0 instead. In this case, after a general parametrization of
the field color structure, the Higgs potential can also be written as a perfect square,
leading to a relativistic model that accepts a BPS bound. This time, the minimum
energy center vortex states will be 2πv2 and 0, for fundamental and adjoint charges,
respectively.

Let us consider infinite center vortices in SU (2), and the complexified variable,

In this section, we use Cartesian coordinates, and assume translation symmetry along

where D = D2 + iD3. For example, taking X = ζ, we obtain,

(cid:90)

L times an orthogonal matrix. If Ψ is invertible, requiring the diagonal elements of
L to be positive, the factorization is unique. As a matrix in O(3) is a sign times an
SO(3) matrix, and det L = L11L22L33, when det Ψ > 0 (det Ψ < 0) there is a unique
decomposition Ψ = +LRT (Ψ = −LRT ), with RT ∈ SO(3). That is, we can represent,

ψ1 = L11 n1

Then, setting µ2 = 0, using the asymptotic vacuum value v = −κ/λ (κ < 0), and
c = (1/4) λv4, needed to have zero potential energy at the vacuum, the Higgs potential
can be cast in the form,

the dynamical Higgs field ψ1, as occurs at µ2 = 2
λ , where it is necessary to redefine
the model by subtracting a nonrelativistic term proportional to (cid:104)ψ1, B1(cid:105) [38]. A similar
9
field-dependent projection is observed in the BPS center vortex bound of ref. [31]. In
that case, to keep the equations compatible, an appropriate limitting behaviour of the
parameters was needed.

5 Conclusions

The detailed knowledge we have about interquark lattice potentials makes us wonder
what the natural effective description for the Yang–Mills vacuum could be. This search
can be guided by the symmetries, the way they are realized, the identification of large
distance relevant terms in the functional energy and, of course, by the lattice data.
Here, we analyzed a natural class of models with SU (N ) → Z(N ) SSB. This is an in-
teresting SSB pattern, as the confining string would be represented by a smooth center
vortex, thus incorporating N -ality. Initially, we tested a numerical method to solve
the center vortex field equations, obtaining the solutions for infinite and finite center
vortices, the latter running between a monopole and an antimonopole, representing
the external quark and antiquark, respectively.

In fact, the lattice interquark potential has already been adjusted in different phe-
nomenological models, and the lattice data seem to set the parameters close to the
interface between type I and type II superconductors. For instance, this has been ob-
served in a dual Abelian Higgs model that essentially describes a condensate of Abelian
monopoles. However, we know that in that case, N -ality cannot be accommodated.
In the second part of this work, we reconciled both properties in our framework. We
showed numerically and analytically (for SU (2) and SU (3)) that there is a region in
parameter space where the field equations freeze some Higgs profiles to a constant
vacuum value. In this region, the profiles for the gauge field along a local Cartan di-
rection, and for the Higgs fields that rotate, exactly satisfy Nielsen–Olesen equations.
So we can already conclude that in our non Abelian context, the fitting of lattice data
will be as good as in the Abelian one, with the advantage of implementing N -ality.

Moreover, in the case of SU (2), after freezing one of the Higgs fields at a local
vacuum value, we derived a BPS bound that is topological and gauge invariant under
regular gauge transformations. This point provides the type-I/type-II superconductor
interface. The steps followed are similar to those previously given to derive a BPS
κ2
point, at µ2 = 2
λ , λ = g2, by the inclusion of a nonrelativistic interaction that tends
9
to align the magnetic field and one of the Higgs fields along the same Lie algebra
direction. As a consequence, in that work, all BPS solutions had zero energy. Here,
we have shown that to get a BPS bound at µ2 = 0, λ = g2, the model requires no
alignment term. This time, the minimum energy center vortex states are 2πv2 and 0,
for fundamental (z = 1) and adjoint (z = 2) charges, respectively.

These are essential tools that will permit to determine, in a forthcoming work, the
appropriate model that is compatible with the various observables already computed
in the lattice, as normal and hybrid potentials, and the energy density profiles.
