Abstract

In a circuit consisting of two or more resonators, the inter-cavity crosstalk is inevitable, which

could create some problems, such as degrading the performance of quantum operations and the

ﬁdelity of various quantum states. The focus of this work is to propose a crosstalk-insensitive

method for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators, which is important in large-

scale quantum information processing and communication in a network consisting of resonators

or cavities.

In this work, we consider 2N resonators of diﬀerent frequencies, which are coupled

to a three-level quantum system (qutrit). By applying a strong pulse to the coupler qutrit, we

show that an eﬀective Hamiltonian can be constructed for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs

of resonators. The main advantage of this proposal is that the eﬀect of inter-resonator crosstalks

is greatly suppressed by using resonators of diﬀerent frequencies. In addition, by employing the

qutrit-resonator dispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is virtually

excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This eﬀective Hamiltonian can be

applied to implement quantum operations with photonic qubits distributed in diﬀerent resonators.

As one application of this Hamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously generate multiple EPR

pairs of photonic qubits distributed in 2N resonators. Numerical simulations show that it is feasible

to prepare two high-ﬁdelity EPR photonic pairs using a setup of four one-dimensional transmission

line resonators coupled to a superconducting ﬂux qutrit with current circuit QED technology.

I. INTRODUCTION

Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), consisting of microwave resonators and su-

perconducting qubits, has quickly developed in the last decade and is considered one of the

most promising platforms for quantum information processing (QIP) (for reviews, see [1-4]).

Superconducting qubits are very important in solid-state quantum computation and QIP,

due to the controllability of their level spacings, the scalability of circuits, and the improve-

ment of coherence times [5-14]. High-quality-factor microwave resonators have also drawn

much attention because they have many applications in QIP; for example, they can be used

as quantum data buses [15-18] and quantum memories [19,20]. A superconducting coplanar

waveguide resonator with a (loaded) quality factor Q = 106 [21,22] or with an internal quality

factor above 107 [23] was previously reported. Superconducting microwave resonators with
a loaded quality factor Q = 3.5 × 107 have been recently demonstrated in experiments [24],
for which the single-photon lifetime can reach near one millisecond, while the cavity mode

remains strong-coupled with a superconducting qubit. The strong or ultrastrong coupling

between a superconducting qubit and a microwave cavity has been experimentally observed

[18,25-27]. Moreover, quantum phenomena, such as squeezing or multiphoton quantum Rabi

oscillations in the ultrastrong coupling regimes, have been theoretically investigated [28,29].

As this is relevant to this work, here we provide a brief review on the production and

manipulation of quantum states of microwave photons in circuit QED. For convenience, the

term cavity and resonator will be used interchangeably. During the past years, a number of

theoretical works [30-35] have been done on the preparation of Fock states, coherent states,

squeezed states, Schrodinger cat states and an arbitrary superposition of Fock states of a

single superconducting cavity. Experimentally, the creation of a Fock state or a superposition

of Fock states of a single superconducting cavity has been reported [17,36,37]. In recent years,

attention has shifted to larger systems involving two or more cavities. Based on circuit

QED, many theoretical proposals have been presented for implementing quantum state

synthesis of photons in two resonators [38, 39], generating entangled photon Fock states

of two resonators [40,41], creating photon NOON states of two resonators [38,39,42,43],

and preparing entangled photon Fock states or entangled coherent states of more than

two cavities [44-46]. In addition, schemes for realizing two-qubit or multi-qubit quantum

gates with microwave photons distributed in diﬀerent cavities have been proposed [47,48].

3

Experimentally, the creation of photon NOON states of two resonators has been reported

[49], and the coherent transfer of microwave photons between three resonators interconnected

by two phase qubits has also been demonstrated [50]. All these works are fundamental

and important, and open new avenues to use microwave photons as resource for quantum

computation and communication.

In a circuit consisting of two or more resonators, the inter-cavity crosstalk is inevitable,

which could create some problems, such as degrading the performance of quantum operations

and the ﬁdelity of various quantum states. Let us consider a two-cavity system, for which

the inter-cavity crosstalk is described by the Hamitonian H = g(ei∆tab+ + e−i∆ta+b), where

g is the inter-cavity crosstalk strength between the two cavities, ∆ is the detuning between

the frequencies of the two cavities, and a (b) is the photon annihilation operator of one (the

other) cavity. From the form of the Hamiltonian H, it can be seen that the eﬀect of the

cavity-cavity crosstalk depends on the ratio of α = ∆/g, which increases as α decreases.

In other words, the eﬀect of the cavity crosstalk is strongest for ∆ = 0 (i.e., when the two

cavities have the same frequency), while it can be reduced by increasing α (e.g., increasing

the detuning ∆ for a given g). The discussion here gives a hint on how to reduce the eﬀect of

the inter-cavity crosstalk. Namely, in order to reduce the eﬀect of the inter-cavity crosstalk,

one could employ cavities with diﬀerent frequencies.

In this work, we focus on a physical system consisting of 2N resonators coupled to a three-

level quantum system (qutrit). It is shown that by applying a strong pulse to the coupler

qutrit, an eﬀective Hamiltonian can be obtained for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs

of resonators with diﬀerent frequencies, which is insensitive to the inter-resonator crosstalk.

This eﬀective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with photonic

qubits distributed in diﬀerent resonators. The major advantage of this proposal is that the

inter-resonator crosstalk is greatly reduced because of using diﬀerent resonator frequencies.

In addition, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is virtually excited due to

the qutrit-resonator dispersive interaction, and thus decoherence from this level is greatly

suppressed.

As one application of this constructed Hamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously

generate multiple Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs [51] of photonic qubits distributed in

2N resonators. The prepared EPR pairs are particularly useful in quantum communication

and QIP. As a speciﬁc experimental realization, we further discuss the possible experimental

4

implementation of two EPR pairs of photonic qubits using a setup consisting of four one-

dimensional transmission line resonators coupled to a superconducting ﬂux qutrit. With

realistic device and circuit parameters, numerical simulations show that the ﬁdelity can

reach 98.42% for the joint state of two EPR pairs and is no less than 99.05% for each EPR

pair.

We note that previous works focused on the preparation of a single EPR pair in var-

ious physical systems, such as neutral Kaons [52], trapped ions [53,54], atoms interacting

with a cavity mode [55-58], Bose-Einstein condensates [59-61], two harmonic oscillators in

nonequilibrium open systems [62], center-of-mass motion of two massive objects [63], and

superconducting qubits [15,64-66]. In stark contrast, ours is aimed at simultaneously gener-

ating multiple EPR pairs by using the constructed Hamiltonian, which is insensitive to the

inter-resonator crosstalk.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we derive the eﬀective Hamiltonian govern-

ing the dynamics of N pairs of cavities plus one three-level coupler qutrit. This Hamiltonian

describes paired interactions between these cavities in parallel without interfering with each

other.

In Sec. III, we show in detail how to simultaneously prepare N pairs of photonic

qubits using this eﬀective Hamiltonian. In Sec. IV, we discuss the possible experimental

implementation of generating EPR states of two pairs of photonic qubits in circuit QED.

In Sec. V, we summarize our results and discuss other possible applications of this physical

process.

II. EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN

Consider 2N resonators coupled to a qutrit A (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst set of N resonators are

labeled as resonators a1, a2, ..., and aN while the second set of N resonators are labeled as
resonators b1, b2, ...,and bN . In addition, the three levels of qutrit A are denoted as |gi , |ei
and |fi (Fig. 2). Suppose that resonator aj (bj) with j = 1, 2, ..., N is coupled to the |gi
↔ |fi (|ei ↔ |fi) transition with coupling strength gj (µj) and detuning ∆j = ωf g − ωaj =
ωf e − ωbj > 0 (Fig. 2). Here, ωaj (ωbj ) is the frequency of resonator aj (bj). In addition, a
classical pulse of frequency ω is applied to the qutrit A, which is resonant with the |gi ↔ |ei
transition (Fig. 2). In the interaction picture, the Hamiltonian of the whole system is given

Under the large-detuning condition ∆j ≫ gj, µj, the intermediate level |fi can be adia-

the Raman couplings associated with resonator pairs (aj, ak) , (bj, bk), and (aj, bk), with
j 6= k, are suppressed because the corresponding eﬀective coupling strengths are much
smaller than the detunings of these Raman transitions. In addition, we assume ∆j ≫ Ω so
that the energy shift of the qutrit dressed states produced by the classical pulse is very small

compared to ∆j, and hence the eﬀect of this pulse on the strength of each Raman coupling is

negligible. Under these conditions, we can obtain the following eﬀective Hamiltonian [67,68]

We note that previous works [69,70] considered the coupling of a quantized cavity mode

and a strong classical pulse via a superconducting qubit or two-level atoms, which also

employed the strong driving limit in the derivation of the eﬀective Hamiltonians. In this

sense, they are related to this work. However, they [69,70] are diﬀerent from ours. The

reasons are: they were focused on how to construct the simultaneous implementation of

a Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings dynamics for a system composed of a su-

perconducting qubit/two-level atoms and one cavity, and only a single quantized cavity

mode was involved there. Instead, our work is aimed at deriving an eﬀective Hamiltonian

for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators. One can see that the form of our

eﬀective Hamiltonian of Eq. (9) is diﬀerent from those given in [69,70]. In addition, our

eﬀective Hamiltonian (9) contains two quantized cavity modes for each pair of resonators,

instead of just one single cavity mode.

III. GENERATION OF MULTIPLE EPR STATES

When the qutrit is in the state |+i (readily prepared by applying a π-pulse resonant with
the |gi ↔ |ei transition of the qutrit initially in the ground state |gi), it will remain in this
state because the state |+i is not aﬀected by the Hamiltonian (9). Thus, the qutrit part
can be ignored and the eﬀective Hamiltonian (9) further reduces to

He = −

NXj=1

(ˆajˆb+

ˆbj).

(10)

This Hamiltonian describes the coupler-mediated eﬀective interactions for the N pairs of

cavities (aj, bj) in parallel, which will be used below to simultaneously generate multiple

EPR states of N pairs of photonic qubits.

Note that the Hamiltonian (10) is obtained under unitary transformations eiH0t and

eiH ′

0t. To obtain the time-propagating states in the original internation picture, two reverse

9

transformations e−iH0t and e−iH ′

0t need to be performed on the corresponding time-evolution

states under this Hamiltonian.

Assume now that the ﬁrst set of resonators (a1, a2, ..., aN ) is initially in the state |ψ (0)ia =
j=1 |1iaj
, i.e., each resonator in this set is initially prepared in the single-photon state;
j=1 |0ibj

QN
while the second set of resonators (b1, b2, ..., bN ) is initially in the state |ψ (0)ib =QN

i.e., each of these resonators is initially prepared in the vacuum state.

One can easily ﬁnd that under the Hamiltonian He, the state of the resonator system

after an evolution time t is given by

k/∆k, (j 6= k),

(15)

which can be readily met by adjusting the detuning ∆j or ∆k (e.g., varying the resonator

frequency). Alternatively, this condition can be satisﬁed by adjusting the coupling strength

gj or gk (e..g, through a prior design of the sample with appropriate qutrit-resonator coupling

capacitances).

As shown above, the N EPR photonic pairs are prepared based on the eﬀective Hamil-

tonian (9), which was derived without considering the unwanted couplings of the res-

onators/pulse with the irrelevant level transitions of the qutrit. To minimize decoherence
eﬀects induced due to the leakage into the level |fi, one can employ the DRAG pulse with
a cosine envelope shape [71] or a detuned pulse with the DRAG pulse shaping [72], which

can signiﬁcantly reduce both leakage error and phase error. In addition, one can design the

qutrit level structure with a large level anharmonicity, such that the unwanted couplings of

the resonators/pulse with the irrelevant qutrit level transitions are negligible. The strong

pulse may cause heating of the qutrit. For a short pulse, the eﬀect of incoherent processes
caused due to the heating, such as thermal excitations or noise at the |ei ↔ |fi transition, is
negligible [72]. For a long pulse, the unwanted incoherent processes induced by the heating

can be suppressed through improved thermalization by cooling the sample [73].

IV. POSSIBLE EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION

We now provide a quantitative analysis on the experimental feasibility of the proposal.

As an example, let us consider a setup of four one-dimensional transmission line resonators

coupled by a superconducting ﬂux qutrit (Fig. 3).

With the unwanted interaction being considered, the Hamiltonian (1) is modiﬁed as

H ′ = H + δH1 + δH2 (with N = 2), where δH1 describes the unwanted inter-resonator

crosstalk while δH2 describes the unwanted |ei ↔ |fi transition induced by the pulse. The
expression of δH1 is given by

δH1 = ga1b1ei∆a1b1 ta1b+

+ga1a2ei∆a1a2 ta1a+

2 + gb1b2ei∆b1 b2 tb1b+

2 + h.c.,

(16)

where gajbk is the coupling strength between the two resonators aj and bk with frequency
detuning ∆aj bk = ωbk − ωaj (j, k = 1, 2); ga1a2 is the coupling strength between the two
resonators a1 and a2 with frequency detuning ∆a1a2 = ωa2 − ωa1; and gb1b2 is the coupling
strength between the two resonators b1 and b2 with frequency detuning ∆b1b2 = ωb2 − ωb1.
δH2 is given by

δH2 = Ωf eei∆tS+

f e + H.c.,

(17)

where ∆ = ωf e − ωeg, and Ωf e is the pulse Rabi frequency associated with the |ei ↔ |fi
transition.

It should be mentioned that the |gi ↔ |fi transition induced by the pulse is negligible
because ωeg ≪ ωf g (Fig. 2). For simplicity, we also assume that the resonator-induced
coherent transitions between any other irrelevant levels are negligibly small. This can be

achieved by a prior design of the coupler with a suﬃciently large anharmonicity of the level

spacings (readily available for a superconducting ﬂux device).

Taking into account the qutrit dephasing and energy relaxation as well as the resonator

dissipation, the system dynamics, under the Markovian approximation, is determined by the

is the reduced density operator of the two pairs of photonic qubits after tracing ρ over the

degrees of the coupler qutrit, when the operation is performed in a realistic system (with

dissipation and dephasing considered).

In a real situation, it may be a challenge to obtain homogeneous coupling strengths.

Thus, we consider µ1 = 0.95g1 and µ2 = 0.95g2 in our numerical simulation. Namely, there

c1 = ∆1/g1 is the normalized detuning and Ω is the Rabi frequency.

exists a diﬀerence of 5% between the coupling strengths for each pair of resonators, which

may be reasonable in experiments. Note that our numerical simulations are performed by

choosing the operation time t = π/ (2λ) above, which is the operation time for an ideal

homogeneous coupling.

For a three-level ﬂux qutrit, the transition frequency between two neighboring levels

can be varied from 5 GHz to 20 GHz. As an example, we consider ωeg/2π = 7.5 GHz
and ωf g/2π = 12.5 GHz, for which we have ∆/2π = −2.5 GHz. We set ∆1/2π = 0.75
GHz and ∆2/2π = 1.5 GHz, which yields ∆a1a2/2π = ∆b1b2/2π = −0.75 GHz, ∆a1b1/2π =
∆a2b2/2π = −7.5 GHz, ∆a1b2/2π = −8.25 GHz, and ∆a2b1/2π = −6.75 GHz (Fig. 2). For
simplicity, we choose gaj bk = ga1a2 = gb1b2 ≡ gcs and Ωf e = Ω. Other parameters used in
the numerical simulation are: (i) γ−1
f e = 2.5 µs,
γ −1
f g = 3.5 µs (a conservative consideration, e.g., see Ref. [12]); and (ii) κ−1
= 10 µs
(j = 1, 2).

ϕ,e = 2.5 µs, γ −1

ϕ,f = 1.5 µs, γ −1

eg = 5 µs, γ −1

We now numerically calculate the ﬁdelity for the two prepared EPR-pair states. For given

values of ∆1, ∆2, and g1, the value of g2 can be determined by Eq. (15). We deﬁne c1 = ∆1/g1

and c2 = ∆2/g2. Based on Eq. (15), we have c2 =p∆2/∆1c1 = √2c1 for the ∆1 and ∆2

chosen above. To see how the inter-resonator crosstalk aﬀects the operation performance,

in Fig. 4 we plot the ﬁdelity versus c1, by choosing Ω/2π = 100 MHz and considering
gcs = 0, 0.2gm, 0.4gm, 0.6gm, 0.8gm, gm. Here and below, gm = max{g1, g2, µ1, µ2}. From Fig.

14

4, one can see that the eﬀect of the inter-cavity crosstalk coupling is very small even when

gcs = 0.4gm, and a high ﬁdelity > 97.86% can be reached for c1 = 11 (corresponding to

c2 = 11√2). In this case, the estimated operation time is ∼ 40 ns. In the following analysis,

we choose gcs = 0.4gm. Note that according to the discussion in [44], a smaller crosstalk
gcs ≤ 0.01gm can be achieved with the typical capacitive cavity-qutrit coupling illustrated
in Fig. 1.

We now consider the dependence of the operation performance on the value of the Rabi

frequency Ω of the pulse. Figure 5 shows the ﬁdelity versus c1 and Ω. From Fig. 5, one

can see that the operation performance strongly depends on the pulse Rabi frequency Ω.

On the other hand, Fig. 5 shows that for c1 ∈ [7, 17] (c2 ∈ [7√2, 17√2]), a high ﬁdelity
F ≥ 92.4% can be reached for a wide range of Ω: Ω/2π ∈ [50, 200] MHz. Note that a pulse
Rabi frequency Ω/2π ∼ 300 MHz or higher was reported in experiments [76,77]. In Figure 5,
the optimal point is c1 = 10.2 (c2 = 10.2√2) and Ω/2π = 110 MHz, for which the maximum
ﬁdelity of the joint state of the two prepared EPR pairs is Fmax = 98.42%, corresponding
to the ﬁdelities Fa1b1 = 99.05% and Fa2b2 = 99.07% for the qubit pairs (a1, b1) and (a2, b2),
respectively.
For c1 ∈ [7, 17] and c2 ∈ [7√2, 17√2], we have g1/2π ∈ [107, 44] MHz, g2/2π ∈ [151, 62]
MHz, µ1/2π ∈ [102, 42] MHz, and µ2/2π ∈ [143, 59] MHz. The coupling strengths of these
values are readily achievable in experiments because a coupling strength ∼ 636 MHz has
been reported for a superconducting ﬂux device coupled to a one-dimensional transmission

line resonator [78]. For the transition frequencies of the qutrit and the detunings given
above, we have ωa1/ (2π) ∼ 11.75 GHz, ωa2/ (2π) ∼ 11 GHz, ωb1/ (2π) ∼ 4.25 GHz, and
ωb2/ (2π) ∼ 3.5 GHz. Thus, for the values of κ−1
bj used in the numerical simulation,
the required quality factors for the four resonators are Qa1 ∼ 7.4 × 105, Qa2 ∼ 6.8 × 105,
Qb1 ∼ 2.7 × 105, and Qb2 ∼ 2.2 × 105, available in experiments [21-23]. The analysis
here demonstrates that the high-ﬁdelity generation of two EPR pairs of photonic qubits

aj and κ−1

distributed in the four resonators is feasible within present-day circuit QED techniques.

The prepared EPR pairs of photonic qubits can be read out by employing the conventional

approach [79], i.e., mapping the states of the photonic qubits to superconducting qubits,

whose states can be detected fast and accurately [80]. One can also use an alternative

method introduced in [69] to measure the photonic qubits with a relatively fast speed and

minimal action of decoherence.

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented an eﬃcient method for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of

resonators by using a qutrit as a coupler. This proposal signiﬁcantly reduces the eﬀects

of unwanted inter-resonator crosstalks which are inherent in a circuit consisting of two or

more resonators. We showed that, under frequency matching conditions, the dynamics of

the resonators is described by an eﬀective Hamiltonian, which can be used for one-step

generation of multiple EPR pairs of photonic qubits. Further, our numerical simulation

demonstrated that the obtained EPR states can have high ﬁdelities using present-day circuit

QED technology. Finally, we note that this eﬀective Hamiltonian has other applications.

For instance, it can be directly applied to implement various quantum operations, such as

the simultaneous transfer or exchange of multi-photon quantum states between spatially-

separated resonators or cavities.
