The vacuum state of a relativistic quantum ﬁeld contains entanglement between regions separated
by spacelike intervals. Such spatial entanglement can be revealed using an operational method intro-
duced in [1, 2]. In this approach, a cavity is instantaneously divided into halves by an introduction
of an extra perfect mirror. Causal separation of the two regions of the cavity reveals nonlocal spatial
correlations present in the ﬁeld, which can be quantiﬁed by measuring particles generated in the
process. We use this method to study spatial entanglement properties of nonvacuum Gaussian ﬁeld
states. In particular we show how to enhance the amount of harvested spatial entanglement by an
appropriate choice of the initial state of the ﬁeld in the cavity. We ﬁnd a counterintuitive inﬂuence
of the initial entanglement between cavity modes on the spatial entanglement which is revealed by
dividing the cavity in half.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The vacuum ﬂuctuations of a relativistic quantum ﬁeld
in spacelike separated regions are quantum correlated.
This is referred to as vacuum entanglement. It has been
predicted in the context of accelerating frames of refer-
ence [3, 4], as well as in algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory [5–
8]. In [9, 10], it has been shown how entanglement can be
extracted from the vacuum state of a quantum ﬁeld us-
ing a pair of initially unentangled two-level atoms, known
as Unruh-DeWitt detectors, which interact only locally
with the ﬁeld. A more detailed analysis of this scenario
was later performed in [11]. Moreover, a feasible method
for detecting vacuum entanglement was proposed in a
chain of trapped ions [12]. Such entanglement is believed
to persist between arbitrarily far away regions of bosonic
and fermionic ﬁelds [13–16], and it manifests in the Un-
ruh eﬀect for accelerating observers [10, 11, 17–19]. Re-
cently, however, a thorough analysis of vacuum entangle-
ment was performed for massive ﬁelds [20], where sudden
death of vacuum entanglement as a function of the dis-
tance between the modes was observed. It has also been
shown that vacuum entanglement can be used to violate
Bell’s inequalities [5–8, 15], can be multipartite [21, 22],
and that for massless ﬁelds, it persists between timelike
separated regions [23]. It can also be resonantly enhanced
with the use of a moving cavity [24]. Furthermore, the
phenomenon is expected to be sensitive to spacetime cur-
vature [25, 26], and to have a relevant eﬀect on the pos-
sibility of building ideal relativistic clocks [27, 28].

In this paper, we generalize one of the recent op-
erational methods for investigating vacuum entangle-
ment [1, 2] to nonvacuum Gaussian states. In algebraic
quantum ﬁeld theory it has been stressed that essen-
tially all ﬁeld states possess the aforementioned spatial

entanglement properties [8, 29]. However, to the best of
our knowledge, states other than the vacuum state and
the thermal state [30, 31] have not yet been explored in
the operational approach. In particular, it is not known
whether nonclassical states, such as squeezed states, of-
fer any experimental advantage. Also, it is not clear how
the entanglement between spatial areas and the entan-
glement in the global basis of plane waves or standing
waves are related to each other.

In this paper, we address the above questions. Specif-
ically, we consider coherent states, single-mode squeezed
thermal states, and two-mode squeezed vacuum states.
We show that spatial entanglement is indeed not unique
to vacuum. Moreover, we provide examples of states for
which the eﬀect is stronger and hence easier to detect.
We also observe that the amount of entanglement in the
usual standing wave basis can contribute to the amount
of spatial entanglement.

In our operational approach, an optical cavity is split
into two smaller cavities via rapid introduction of a mir-
ror in between the two mirrors of the cavity. We show
that particle production due to such a change of bound-
ary conditions can be made stronger by using a nonva-
cuum initial state of the ﬁeld inside the cavity. Par-
ticle creation due to rapidly varying boundary condi-
tions is of independent interest, and our work adds to
the body of theoretical predictions concerning this phe-
nomenon [1, 32–35].

This paper is organized in the following way. In Sec. II,
we brieﬂy review the operational model for studying vac-
uum entanglement. In Sec. III A, we focus on the par-
ticle creation eﬀect for initial coherent states. Then, we
study spatial entanglement and particle production for a
single-mode squeezed thermal state in Sec. III B. We de-
vote Sec. III C to investigating whether the ﬁnal amount
of spatial entanglement between the localized modes is
aﬀected by the presence of entanglement between the ini-
tial modes of the cavity. Finally, in Sec. IV, we present
our conclusions, open questions and possible future lines
of research.

and Dirichlet boundary conditions φ(t, 0) = φ(t, R) = 0
for all t. At t = 0 an additional mirror is introduced at
x = r, which corresponds to the condition φ(t, r) = 0
for t > 0. In Sec. III, we will assume r = R/2, in this
section, however, we review the transformation procedure
for arbitrary r ∈ [0, R] as given in [1, 2].

We introduce two families of solutions of the Klein-
Gordon equation (1). The ﬁrst family, (Ul)l∈N, physi-
cally corresponds to the standing waves before the mirror
is inserted. The second family of solutions are (un)n∈N,
(¯un)n∈N. These are the standing waves contained within
the left cavity and within the right cavity after the divi-
sion, respectively. They read as

FIG. 1. We investigate how the state of a quantum ﬁeld in
a cavity changes when the cavity is instantaneously divided
in half with an additional mirror. After such a rapid division
quantum correlated particles are produced [1, 2]. The input
and output states are Gaussian, characterized by the vectors
of ﬁrst moments xin, xout and the covariance matrices σin,
σout.

II. MODEL

In this section, we brieﬂy review the operational ap-
proach of [1, 2]. Consider a one-dimensional Dirichlet
cavity, in the middle of which an additional mirror is
instantaneously introduced (see Fig. 1). The cavity con-
tains a massless scalar ﬁeld in an initial Gaussian state.
First, we calculate the state of the ﬁeld after the mirror
was introduced. This way we are able to investigate the
mean number of particles produced due to introduction
of the mirror. Moreover, we analyze the amount of en-
tanglement between diﬀerent modes of the two smaller
cavities as a function of the initial state of the ﬁeld.

To show the correspondence between entanglement of
particles created in this model and vacuum entanglement,
we recall an extended scheme due to Brown et al. [2]. In
this scheme two mirrors are simultaneously introduced a
ﬁnite distance apart, and it is found that particles cre-
ated by one mirror are entangled with those created by
the other. Since the particle creation events are space-
like separated, one argues that the obtained amount of
entanglement must have been present in the initial state
of the ﬁeld. In this paper we use this scheme, but in a
limit where distance between the two mirrors approaches
zero. Nevertheless, we can retain the interpretation of ex-
tracting entanglement from the initial state rather than
creating it.

A. Classical solutions and the Bogoliubov

transformation

scalar ﬁeld, described by the Klein-Gordon equation:

(3d)

where θ(x) is the Heaviside step function. Having intro-
duced the two families of solutions, we can relate them
by a Bogoliubov transformation:

un(x, t) =

¯un(x, t) =

(αnlUl(x, t) + βnlU∗

(cid:0)¯αnlUl(x, t) + ¯βnlU∗

l (x, t)),

l (x, t)(cid:1).

(4a)

(4b)

n=1

The coeﬃcients αnl, βnl, ¯αnl, ¯βnl are given by Klein-
Gordon scalar products [36] of solutions Ul with un, ¯un,
i.e., the overlaps of the mode functions corresponding to
input states with the mode functions associated with the
output states. To calculate these overlaps, we need to
extend Ul past the t = 0 point so that there is a Cauchy
surface on which both families of solutions are deﬁned.
This would normally require solving equation (1) with a
time-dependent boundary condition at the point where
the mirror is introduced. However, for inﬁnitely fast in-
troduction of the mirror the dynamics can be neglected.
Therefore, we simply extend Ul using free evolution of
the ﬁeld and then we calculate the scalar products, which
leads to these Bogoliubov coeﬃcients:

αnl = (Ul|un) = (Ωl + ωn)Vnl,
βnl = − (U∗
¯αnl = (Ul|¯un) = (Ωl + ωn) ¯Vnl,
¯βnl = − (U∗

l |un) = (Ωl − ωn)Vnl,

l |¯un) = (Ωl − ωn) ¯Vnl,

(6b)

At this point it is worth mentioning that a more care-
ful calculation of these Bogoliubov coeﬃcients has been
performed in [35], which involves solving Eq. (1) with a
time-dependent boundary condition. There, φ(t, r) = 0
is enforced with a boundary condition (for spatially even
solutions)

lim
x→r±

∂xφ(t, x)
φ(t, x)

= B(t),

(7)

where B(t) smoothly changes from 0 to inﬁnity as the
mirror is introduced. The obtained Bogoliubov coeﬃ-
cients for an evolution satisfying condition (7) can be
seen to reduce to the coeﬃcients (5) in the instantaneous
mirror introduction limit. Thus, our approximation that
neglects the dynamics is well founded.

B. Quantum model

Let us proceed by brieﬂy reviewing the quantized ver-
sion of the model introduced in the previous section. In
the canonical quantization procedure with each solution
(Ul)l=1,...,2Λ (where 2Λ is a UV cutoﬀ) we associate a
pair of time-independent hermitian quadrature operators
ˆQl, ˆPl. The quadrature operators obey canonical bosonic

commutation relations:(cid:104) ˆQi, ˆPj

(cid:105)

= iδij.

(8)

Similarly, we associate quadrature operators ˆqn, ˆpn and
ˆ¯qm, ˆ¯pm with the solutions (un)n=1,...,Λ and (¯um)m=1,...,Λ.
We conveniently arrange these operators into two vectors:

(cid:16) ˆQ1, ˆP1, . . . , ˆQ2Λ, ˆP2Λ

ˆxin =

ˆxout =(cid:0)ˆq1, ˆp1, . . . , ˆqΛ, ˆpΛ, ˆ¯q1, ˆ¯p1, . . . , ˆ¯qΛ, ˆ¯pΛ

(9)

(10)

(cid:1).

Then, the Bogoliubov transformation (4) can be written
as

(13a)

(13b)

In this paper, we limit ourselves to Gaussian initial
states [37]. Since the Bogoliubov transformation (4) is
linear in quadrature operators, the transformed state will
also be Gaussian. Therefore, the ﬁrst and second statisti-
cal moments are suﬃcient to characterize both the initial
and ﬁnal states, i.e., the state of the ﬁeld before and af-
ter the introduction of the mirror. The ﬁrst moments are
given by a vector of expectation values:

x = (cid:104) ˆx(cid:105) ,

(14)

while the second moments are given by a covariance ma-
trix, which consists of 2×2 blocks deﬁned in the following
way:

(cid:18)(cid:104){∆ˆqi, ∆ˆqj}(cid:105) (cid:104){∆ˆqi, ∆ˆpj}(cid:105)

where ∆ ˆA = ˆA −(cid:10) ˆA(cid:11) and {,} is the anticommutator.

(cid:104){∆ˆpi, ∆ˆqj}(cid:105) (cid:104){∆ˆpi, ∆ˆpj}(cid:105)

(cid:19)

σij =

(15)

The Bogoliubov transformation (4) implies the following
transformation laws for the vector of ﬁrst moments and
the covariance matrix hold:

,

xout = Sxin,
σout = SσinST.

(16a)
(16b)

Finally, we are interested in two properties of the state
after transformation, namely entanglement and the av-
erage number of particles. To calculate these we divide
the 4Λ × 4Λ covariance matrix σout into 2Λ × 2Λ blocks:

.

σout =

γT ¯σ

(17)
Then, we divide the blocks σ, γ, and ¯σ further into 2× 2
blocks σij, γij, and ¯σij, describing the states of individ-
ual modes and correlations between them. In this block
notation, we can easily give the expectation value of the
particle number operator, for example for mode un, as

(cid:16)(cid:104)ˆqn(cid:105)2 + (cid:104)ˆpn(cid:105)2(cid:17)

.

(18)

(cid:104)ˆnn(cid:105) =

1
4

(Tr σnn − 2) +

1
2

While for mode ¯un the formula contains the barred coun-
terparts ¯σnn, ˆ¯qn, and ˆ¯pn.

To calculate the entanglement between a pair of modes
un and ¯um we need to ﬁnd the corresponding covariance
matrix, which we will denote by σout|nm. It is obtained
by deleting all the entries of the matrix σout except for
the 16 entries which lie on the intersection of the four
rows and four columns corresponding to modes un and
¯um:

(cid:18) σ γ

(cid:19)

σout|nm =

(19)

(cid:18)σnn γnm

(cid:19)

nm ¯σmm

We use logarithmic negativity [38] as an operational mea-
sure of entanglement between the modes, as it is an en-
tanglement monotone and provides an upper bound to
distillable entanglement. The logarithmic negativity of
the reduced state of modes un and ¯um is easy to com-
pute and is given by

C. Transformation of the covariance matrices of

nonvacuum states

The covariance matrix of the vacuum is unity, hence
the result of the transformation (16b) for the vacuum as
the initial state is simply σout = SST. Let us now assume
the input state is the vacuum in all modes except Uk, in
which we have a single-mode Gaussian state described by
a covariance matrix σin
kk. Under such circumstances, the
2 × 2 blocks of σ, γ, and ¯σ (see Eq. (17)), are equal to

(22c)

The above result uses the fact that Snl are symmetric,
and reduces to SST when σin

kk = 11.

The second type of an input state that is of our interest
in this paper is the one that has all modes in the vacuum
state except for the two modes Uk, Uk(cid:48) (k < k(cid:48)). The
reduced state of these two modes is a two-mode Gaussian
state described by a 4 × 4 covariance matrix:

σin|kk(cid:48) =

In this case, using Eqs. (13) and (16b) the blocks of σ,

SPATIAL ENTANGLEMENT AND
PARTICLE PRODUCTION

In this section we ﬁrst study particle production and
entanglement extraction for coherent states and general
single-mode Gaussian states as initial states of the large
cavity before division. Then, we compare the spatial en-
tanglement of a two-mode squeezed state and a state con-
sisting only of its thermal marginals. This way, we are
able to demonstrate that the result of introducing the
mirror is sensitive to correlations present in the initial
state of the cavity. Throughout this section, we assume
that the additional mirror is introduced precisely in the
middle of the cavity, i.e., r = R/2.

A. Coherent states

For the ﬁrst input state, we assume that all the modes
are in the vacuum state, except for the mode Uk which
is prepared in a coherent state with the amplitude ρ > 0
and phase ϕ. Using Eqs. (14) and (15), the vector of ﬁrst
moments and the covariance matrix of this state can be
written respectively as

ρ cos ϕ n = k,

xin
n =

ρ sin ϕ n = k + 1,
otherwise,
0
σin = 11.

(25a)

(25b)

At this point we note that changing the ﬁrst moments
of the initial state does not change the covariance matrix,
and hence the entanglement, of the state after the intro-
duction of the mirror (see Eqs. (4) and (20)). Since coher-
ent states diﬀer from the vacuum only in their ﬁrst mo-
ments, their spatial entanglement is the same as that of
the vacuum, which was already discussed elsewhere [1, 2].
Therefore, in this subsection, we focus only on the aver-
age number of particles produced due to division of the
cavity.

5

FIG. 3. Results from Fig. 2 averaged over phase ϕ of the
initial coherent state (25). The expected number of particles
after inserting the mirror is expressed here as a percentage of
the number of particles initially in the cavity. We see that
the random phase of the initial coherent state implies at least
two lowest modes need to be considered to witness the overall
increase in the total number of particles.

(cid:10) ˆφ(0, r)(cid:11) = 0. In this case, since the modes un and ¯un

have higher frequencies than Ul modes, energy conserva-
tion implies a decrease in the number of particles. This
explains the absorption, rather than production, of par-
ticles we observe around ϕ = π/2.

From a quantum-optical perspective the dependence
on phase, which is visible in Fig. 2, resembles a degener-
ate parametric ampliﬁer [39]. For the ampliﬁer, however,
the strength of particle production depends on the phase
diﬀerence between the pumping and the ampliﬁed beam,
whereas in our case no system providing the reference
phase seems to be present. It turns out, however, that the
phase reference is in fact provided in our setting by the
choice of the boundary conditions on the mirror. Dirich-
let boundary conditions, requiring that the ﬁeld modes
vanish at the mirror, do violate the phase symmetry of
the ﬁeld. Alternatively, forcing ∂tφ to be zero at the mir-
ror location would amplify coherent states with ϕ = π/2
rather than those with ϕ = 0 as it is in our case.

Finally, if the phase of the initial coherent state is un-
determined, then we need to consider a phase-averaged
coherent state, which is non-Gaussian. Luckily, the parti-
cle number is a linear function of the density matrix, and
thus the phase averaging of the initial state is equivalent
to the phase averaging of the result (26). Fig. 3 shows the
mean numbers of particles after introduction of a mirror
into a cavity containing a phase-averaged coherent state.
We observe that the average number of particles decays
with frequency, and that the detection of particles in the
few lowest modes is enough to witness signiﬁcant parti-
cle production. We point out that the average particle
number in modes un or ¯un decays slower than 1/n, which
causes the total number of particles to diverge. We post-
pone, however, the discussion of this divergence until the
end of this section.

FIG. 2. Expected number of particles after a rapid division
of the cavity containing a coherent state (25) is equal to a
constant plus the term (26) which is proportional to the initial
number of particles. Here, the proportionality constant is
shown as a function of phase for a coherent state initially in
the ﬁrst mode of the cavity. Solid, dashed and dot-dashed
lines stand for the sum of the average numbers of particles
in modes un and ¯un, where n = 1, 2, 3 respectively. Notice
that the number of particles can either increase or decrease
depending on phase ϕ of the initial coherent state.

The average number of particles after the introduction
of the mirror is a sum of contributions from the ﬁrst and
from the second moments, as given in Eq. (18). For a co-
herent state, the term corresponding to second moments
is equal to the number of particles produced by insert-
ing the mirror when the cavity is in the vacuum state.
This is, however, a negligible number [1, 2]. Since we are
interested in the possible advantage of a coherent state
over the vacuum state in the context of particle produc-
tion, we need to discuss the contribution of the nonzero
ﬁrst moments. Using Eqs. (16a) and (25a), it is straight-
forward to calculate the expectation values appearing in
Eq. (18) for the state of the mode un:

(cid:104)ˆqn(cid:105)2 + (cid:104)ˆpn(cid:105)2 = 4ρ2V 2

nk

n cos2 ϕ + Ω2

(cid:0)ω2

k sin2 ϕ(cid:1).

(26)

Since we introduce the mirror precisely in the middle
of the cavity, an identical result holds for the mode ¯un on
the right side of the mirror. As expected from the linear-
ity of the transformation (4), we observe that the ﬁnal
and initial average number of particles are proportional
to each other. The proportionality constant is plotted in
Fig. 2 for k = 1.

The dependence of particle production on the phase ϕ
can be understood in terms of the expectation value of
the ﬁeld at the event where the mirror is inserted. We can
see from Eqs. (25a) and (2) that ϕ equal to 0 or π corre-

sponds to states with the maximum value of(cid:10) ˆφ(0, r)(cid:11), for

which the amount of particles produced and the increase
of energy are also maximal. The only choice of phase
for which the energy of the state remains unchanged is
ϕ = π/2. This corresponds to an initial state for which

B. Single-mode squeezed thermal states

As another input state we consider the ﬁrst mode of
the cavity to be in a squeezed thermal state, while the
remaining modes are in their ground states. The vector
of ﬁrst moments and the covariance matrix for this state
read as follows:

coeﬃcient s, the squeezing angle θ, and is given by

We note that σin
kk, as given above, is the most general single-mode Gaussian state with vanishing ﬁrst moments [37].
As previously mentioned, the ﬁrst moments do not contribute to the amount of spatial entanglement and therefore
this state is the most general single-mode Gaussian state for the studies of spatial entanglement harvesting.
After inserting the above into Eq. (22) and expanding the Snl blocks, we compute the covariance matrix of the
reduced state of the lowest mode on the left and on the right side of the mirror. It has the form σout|11 of Eq. (19)
with

In this case, the expression for γ11 is the same as σ11
with a sign ﬂip at the l = 2 term. The reason is that
for r = R/2 we have V12 = − ¯V12 and V1l = ¯V1l for l (cid:54)= 2
(see Eq. (6)).

Using the reduced state of the modes u1 and ¯u1 to-
gether with Eq. (20), we are able to study the spatial
entanglement between these two modes.
In Fig. 4, we
have plotted the logarithmic negativity for a number of
speciﬁc initial states. From this ﬁgure, we immediately
conclude that the spatial entanglement of nonsqueezed
thermal states vanishes rapidly as the temperature of the
thermal state increases. As can be observed in the ﬁgure,
the spatial entanglement is no longer detectable when the
expected number of initial thermal particles ¯n is greater
than approximately 0.2 [40]. Another conclusion we draw
from the results depicted in Fig. 4 is that squeezing gen-
erally enhances the amount of extracted spatial entan-
glement.
In particular, as the squeezing parameter of
the initial state increases we are able to detect spatial

entanglement at higher temperatures (see Fig. 5).

We now turn to the analysis of the average number of
particles produced due to introduction of the extra mir-
ror in the cavity with the initial state given in Eqs. (27)
and (28). Using Eqs. (18) and (29), we obtain the expec-
tation value of the particle number operator for modes

In this section, we investigate whether the presence of
entanglement between global modes Ul can contribute to
the spatial entanglement, i.e., the amount of entangle-
ment in the basis of localized modes un and ¯um. To this
aim, we compare the spatial entanglement of two states
which diﬀer only in the presence of correlations in the
initial basis. The ﬁrst state is a two-mode squeezed vac-
uum [39] of the modes U1 and U2, which is an entangled
state. With s as the squeezing parameter and θ as the
squeezing angle the vector of ﬁrst moments and the co-
variance matrix are given by

states (27) as a function of squeezing coeﬃcient for various
temperatures. Dotted, dot-dashed, dashed and solid lines
correspond to expectation values of the number of thermal
particles ¯n = 0, 5, 10, 15. The ¯n value of 15 approximately
corresponds to what could be achieved with a superconduct-
ing cavity-on-a-chip setup in dilution refrigerator tempera-
tures [40].

The second state, on the other hand, is a product state
built up from the partial traces of the two-mode squeezed
state. Therefore, it has the same covariance matrix as the
two-mode squeezed state, given by Eqs. (31) and (32),
except that its oﬀ-diagonal blocks are zero, i.e., σin
12 = 0.
We ﬁrst calculate the reduced states of pairs of modes
un, ¯um for the two initial states introduced above. These
reduced states have the form σout|nm of Eq. (19) with
the σnn, γnm, and ¯σmm blocks given by Eqs. (24). Then,
to analyze the amount of spatial entanglement, we com-
pute the logarithmic negativity for each mode pair using
Eq. (20) and plot it as a function of n and m in Fig. 7.
In this ﬁgure, we also include for comparison the known
spatial entanglement distribution for the vacuum as the
initial state [2].

First of all, Fig. 7 clearly shows that the entangle-
ment in the basis of un, ¯um is very sensitive to the pres-
ence of correlations in the initial basis. Second, by com-
paring the corresponding plots for the vacuum and the
two-mode squeezed state, we observe that the presence
of correlations in the initial state increases the amount
of entanglement between the lowest modes in the ﬁnal
state. Furthermore, the comparison between the two-
mode squeezed state and its marginals shows that re-
moving correlations from the initial state, while keeping
its partial traces unchanged, causes the entanglement be-
tween the lowest modes to vanish.

Finally, from Fig. 7 one can observe that the distri-
bution of spatial entanglement for a two-mode squeezed
state can be asymmetric. That is, the mode 2 in the right
half of the cavity may be entangled with the mode 1 one
the left, while the mode 2 on the left and the mode 1 on
the right are separable. However, this does not violate

yield the same expectation value of the number of par-
ticles in the output state as phase-averaged coherent or
phase-averaged squeezed states. This is indeed the case,
as can be veriﬁed by comparing Eqs. (26) and (30). This
implies that the values in Fig. 3 apply also to thermal
and to squeezed vacuum states if the squeezing angle can
not be controlled.

side, as the imbalance can be removed or mirrored to the
other side by picking a diﬀerent value for the two-mode
squeezing phase θ.

We would like to conclude this section with a general
remark on the dependence of our results on the number
of modes taken into account, that is the cutoﬀ number
Λ. We have veriﬁed that the state of any single output
mode has a well deﬁned Λ → ∞ limit (see for example
Eqs. (26), (29)). In particular, the number of particles
in any mode, or entanglement between any mode pair,
converges quickly with Λ. What diverges is the total
number of particles summed over all modes of the small
cavities. These divergences, however, do not occur if we
take into account a ﬁnite time of introduction of the mir-
ror. This is because, under such conditions, for modes
of suﬃciently high frequencies the change in boundary
condition is adiabatic, and therefore they remain in their
ground states. As a consequence, they do not contribute
to the total number of particles. Because of that, the
cutoﬀ Λ is related to the time scale of the introduction
of the additional mirror.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have revisited the operational ap-
proach to study vacuum entanglement given by Brown
et al. [2], and applied it to nonvacuum Gaussian states.
In this approach a reﬂecting cavity is divided into two
smaller cavities by a rapid introduction of a new mir-
ror. The entanglement between the small cavities is
then studied. We have observed that certain nonvac-
uum states are more eﬀective in revealing spatial entan-
glement than the vacuum. In particular, we have shown
that single-mode and two-mode squeezing typically en-
hance the amount of spatial entanglement, as can be seen
in Figs. 4 and 7. In fact, our results suggest that a de-
gree of squeezing may be indispensable for observation
of vacuum entanglement. That is because introduction

of squeezing counteracts the increase of temperature (see
Fig. 5), which otherwise is detrimental for the spatial
entanglement [40].

We have also demonstrated a link between spatial en-
tanglement of a state and its entanglement between the
degrees of freedom that are not spatially localized (see
Fig. 7). This provokes interesting and open questions
from a resource-theoretic perspective: does adding en-
tanglement between nonlocalized degrees of freedom in-
crease the amount of entanglement between localized ob-
servables by the same amount? Can such nonspatial en-
tanglement be extracted using localized observables? Fi-
nally, is the reverse process possible, that is the transfer
of spatial entanglement to entanglement between, for ex-
ample, cavity modes of diﬀerent frequencies?

Last but not least, we have obtained promising re-
sults for particle production by sudden introduction of
a boundary condition. Fig. 2 illustrates that the particle
production process is similar to the action of a quantum-
optical phase-sensitive ampliﬁer. For in-phase coherent
states it suﬃces to count particles in the two lowest
modes of the small cavities to witness an almost two-fold
increase in the total number of particles. For random-
phase coherent states or thermal states, as can be seen
from Fig. 3, a 14% increase in the number of particles
is still achievable in a similar situation. These results
are in strong contrast to what is obtained with the vac-
uum as the initial state [1], where the number of particles
produced is much smaller than any conceivable thermal
background. Finally, we would like to point out that sim-
ilar beneﬁts of nonvacuum initial states have been shown
for the shaking-cavity dynamical Casimir eﬀect [41].
