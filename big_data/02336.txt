Abstract

Neutrino masses and mixings, as indicated by current neutrino oscillation experiments, suggest

that neutrino mass matrix posses an approximated µ− τ exchange symmetry. We explore neutrino
parameter space and ﬁnd that a slight µ− τ symmetry breaking can only occur for quasidegenerate
neutrino mass hierarchy with unequal (non zero) Majorana CP violation phases, which are found to

be strongly correlated to the Dirac CP violating phase. Within this framework, robust predictions

for the values of Majorana phases are thus obtained.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrino oscillation experiments performed in last decades have provided remarkable

information about neutrino mixing parameters. Global ﬁts with all three standard ﬂa-

vor neutrinos indicate that [1, 2], in the 3σ ranges, the mixing angles are given by solar

and reactor sin2 θ13 ≈ 0.0234+0.0061

mass diﬀerences are also known with very good accuracy, these are given by the so called
sol ≈ 7.54 × 10−5eV 2 and the atmospheric scale

Unlike the quark sector where mixing angles are all small, the measured mixings in

oscillation experiments are large, except for θ13, which has been found to be rather small, but

certainly non zero. In the standard parametrization, mixings are given by the Pontecorvo-

Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix [3, 4],

where cij and sij stand for cos θij and sin θij, respectively, with the mixing angles given as θ12,
θ13, and θ23. Here, δCP is the Dirac CP-violating phase, whereas K = Diag(e−iβ1/2, e−iβ2/2, 1)

is a diagonal matrix containing two Majorana CP-violating phases, β1 and β2, which do

not contribute to neutrino oscillations. On the other hand, although δCP has not been well
determined so far, ﬁrst hints from global ﬁts [1, 5] points towards δCP ∼ −π/2. Recently, the
era of precision measurements started and a number of undergoing and upcoming oscillation

neutrino experiments are looking for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and the Dirac

CP-violating phase. Such a knowledge will be very important for identifying the underlying

ﬂavor symmetry behind the pattern of lepton ﬂavor mixing.

In a basis where charged lepton masses and weak interactions are simultaneously diagonal,

the labels associated to weak ﬂavors, α, β = e, µ, τ , are transparent and, furthermore, the

PMNS matrix becomes the one that diagonalizes neutrino masses, given in general by the

eﬀective operator

¯ναL(Mν)αβνc

βL + h.c.,

(1.2)

such that UP M N S = Uν · K. Therefore, the neutrino mass matrix can be written in terms of
diagonal (complex) masses, Mdiag = Diag{m1e−iβ1, m2e−iβ2, m3}, simply as

Mν = U∗ν · Mdiag · U†ν .

(1.3)

We will work in such a basis hereafter and we will denote mj ≡ |mj|e−iβj , for j = 1, 2.

It is worth noticing that, while the observed θ13 is close to zero, although non-null, θAT M

is close to its maximal value, π/4. Certainly, neither of the central values of these angles is

in such critical values; however, it is intriguing to observe that, regardless of the hierarchy,

it is possible to establish the approximated empirical relation

1/2 − sin2 θAT M ≈ sin θ13/few ,

(1.4)

which suggests that the deviation of θAT M from its maximal value, ∆θ = π/4 − |θAT M|,
could somehow be correlated to the deviation from zero present in θ13 [6]. Notice that,
in such terms, above empirical relation can be simply rewritten as sin ∆θ ≈ sin θ13/few.
Theoretically, this fact opens a way towards a possible understanding of the observed mixings

as having a common physical origin, by pointing towards a well deﬁned ﬂavor symmetry. As

a matter of fact, it is easy to see that null values of ∆θ and θ13 do increase the symmetry of

the neutrino sector. Such values imply that the mixing matrix Uν would take the bimaximal

form

where the only undeﬁned mixing is ϕ12, which could be taken as the solar mixing. Com-

bination of Eq. (1.5) with Eq. (1.3) allow to read out the general form of the mass terms.

Deﬁning the so obtained mass matrix elements as m0

The two general conditions given as m0

free mass parameters to four, and give rise to the so-called µ − τ symmetry [7]. As a

consequence, observed values of θ13 and ∆θ could be understood as a result of the breaking
of µ − τ symmetry. This issue has inspired many theoretical studies in the last years [6–9].
A very recent review of the status of the µ − τ ﬂavor symmetry can be found in [10].

Very few work, however, has been done regarding the possible values for CP violating

phases (CPVP) in this context. In particular, it has been pointed out that if a small breaking

in the charged lepton or neutrino sector of this symmetry is assumed, it is possible to obtain

limits over the Dirac phase δCP [11], but none is said about Majorana phases. To the best
of our knowledge, those works do not explore the conditions under which µ − τ symmetry
breaking is small. This could be relevant, because a small symmetry breaking is considered

as a starting point in these kind of studies. Our main aim in this work is to carry out a
detailed analysis of the magnitude of the µ− τ symmetry breaking by using the current data
of neutrino mixing parameters, and identify the mass spectrum and CPVP required to get

a small symmetry breaking.

The paper is arranged as follows. We start by parametrizing the breaking of µ − τ
symmetry. Next, we use experimental results on neutrino masses and mixings to explore

breaking parameter space, without assuming any special values for CPVP. We found that

relatively small parameters, and therefore perturbative approximations, are still well allowed
by the data only in speciﬁc cases. In particular, we show that µ− τ symmetry breaking can
be small (less than 10%) when the neutrino masses are almost degenerate and for speciﬁc

values of the CPVP, which are strongly correlated. We also show that this correlation shall

point out a well deﬁned region in parameter space for the CPVP, which becomes a testable
feature for models near the µ − τ symmetric limit. Finally, we present our conclusions.

II. µ − τ SYMMETRY BREAKING PARAMETERS

As it was already mentioned, experimental results show that θ13 and ∆13 do not have
null values, and therefore µ − τ symmetry is broken. However this breaking can be actually
small and the µ − τ symmetry, under certain conditions, be considered as an approximated
symmetry. Our principal goal here is to ﬁnd out such conditions. In general, any generic

neutrino mass matrix can always be parametrized in terms of a symmetric part plus a
correction that explicitly breaks the symmetry, by Mν = Mµ−τ + δM, where Mµ−τ does

posses a µ − τ symmetry, whereas δM is deﬁned by (up to) only two non-zero elements,

where breaking parameters are, clearly, deﬁned as δ = meτ − meµ and ǫ = mτ τ − mµµ. There
is, of course, non a priori reason for those parameters to be small compared to Mµ−τ mass
elements. In order to deal with dimensionless parameters, we deﬁne

(2.2)

where the right-hand-sides have been written according to Eq. (1.3). As usual here we take
i = 1, 2, 3. Combined with Eq. (2.3), the last expressions give the complex parameters, ˆδ
and ˆǫ, in terms of three observed mixing angles, three absolute masses, |m1,2,3|, and three
CPVP.

For the purpose of calculations, we rewrite absolute masses in terms of the two observed

mass squared diﬀerences involved in neutrino oscillations, ∆m2

sol and ∆m2

AT M and the light-

est absolute neutrino mass, namely, m0, as

|m2| = qm2

(2.3)

for IH.

Note that, in above, m0 becomes |m1| for the normal mass hierarchy (NH) and m3 for
the inverted mass hierarchy (IH). Thus, the breaking parameters, ˆδ and ˆǫ, do depend on

nine observables: three mixing angles, two mass squared diﬀerences, the lightest neutrino

mass, and three CPVP, out of which neutrino oscillation experiments have already provided

accurate values for ﬁrst ﬁve of them, leaving so far unknown only the last four. Hence, in
practical terms, the breaking parameter space ˆδ− ˆǫ that can accommodate neutrino mixings
and oscillation mass scales, within experimental uncertainties, should, in principle, remain

greatly undetermined due to the arbitrariness on m0 and CP phases. Nonetheless, we suggest
that by rather assuming the smallness of |ˆδ| and |ˆǫ|, the so resulting bounded parameter
space would not be consistent with any arbitrary value of the neutrino observables, thus,

eventually pinpointing towards some more speciﬁc predictions for the lightest neutrino mass,

and CP phases. We will elaborate this idea in what follows.

5

To our purpose, we shall carry out a general scanning of the absolute values of ˆδ and ˆǫ

parameters using the data given by the oscillation experiments, and allowing m0 and CPVP
to vary within (0 − 0.4) eV and (0 − 2π), respectively. But, before presenting our numerical
results, let us perform an approximated analytical analysis of the expressions in Eq. (2.2), in

order to gain some insight of the expected conditions for having a small symmetry breaking.

Those expressions can be written in the suitable form

ˆδ =

(2.5)

As one can see from these expressions, ˆδ and ˆǫ in Eq. (2.4) become zero when θ13 = 0 and
θ23 = −π/4, as expected from exact µ − τ symmetry. Next, let us analyse under which
conditions |ˆδ|,|ˆǫ| ≪ 1 fulﬁlls. In the three possible approaches given by the hierarchies, and
using the central values for the current mixing parameters [1], we have

Last implies that |ˆδ| ∼ 3.26. Thus, in NH the breaking of µ − τ symmetry originated
from ˆδ is always large, and so there is no need to examine ˆǫ. Notice that this conclusion

is independent of the values for CPVP. These results are conﬁrmed from the numerical

analysis as we will present below and it is also consistent with the results obtained by

a similar approach in Ref.[12].

In this case, one can see that |f| is very large when β1− β2 = 0, whereas it is minimum
for β1 − β2 = ±π, that implies |f| ∼ 1 and hence |ˆδ| ∼ 0.1, which is desirable. On
the other hand, ˆǫ is given in terms of g and h as in Eq. (2.4), which can now be

approximated as

(2.9)

We can see from above expressions that for β1 − β2 = ±π it follows that g ≈ −1 and
h ≈ 4e−iδCP , from where we obtain |ˆǫ| ∼ 0.6. Hence, one can see that the largest
contribution to µ − τ breaking in this case comes from |ˆǫ| rather than |ˆδ|.

• Finally, for degenerated hierarchy (DH) limit, we get

f ≈ −e−iδCP (c2

(2.10)

,

(2.11)

(2.12)

Notice, from this equations, that again |f| is strongly enhanced for β1 − β2 = 0, which
implies |ˆδ|>1 . For example, for β1 = β2 = π and δCP = −π/2 we get |f| ∼ 68, which
leads to |ˆδ| ∼ 2. Other speciﬁc values, however, of CPVP can lead to small breaking
parameters, for example, for β1 = π, β2 = π/2 and δCP = −π/2, we get |f| ∼ 0.6,
|g| ∼ 2, and |h| ∼ 1.7, such that |ˆδ| ∼ 0.2 and |ˆǫ| ∼ 0.1.

From the previous analysis, one can conclude that the case of equal Majorana phases is

strongly disfavoured in any hierarchy. Also, one can easily ﬁgure out that the symmetry is

strongly broken for the NH. This is consistent with previous results presented in Ref. [6],

where only CP conserving situations were analysed. It is also consistent with the numerical

analysis we now present.

FIG. 1. Allowed region by the experimental data for Max[ |ˆδ|, |ˆǫ|], the maximum between |ˆδ| and
|ˆǫ|, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, m0, for the normal and inverted hierarchy. The
regions are obtained by varying δCP and β1,2 in the interval [0, 2π].

In Fig. 1 we display the allowed region for the symmetry breaking parameters that was

obtained by varying the Dirac, δCP , and Majorana phases, β1 and β2, in all their possible
(0− 2π) range whereas taking the mixing parameters within a 3 σ level. In there, we depict
the maximum value between |ˆδ| and |ˆǫ|, namely Max[|ˆδ|,|ˆǫ|], as a function of the lightest
neutrino mass. From this ﬁgure one can easily see that for m0 ∼ 0 eV., in the NH, the
breaking parameters are very large regardless of CPVP values, as it was indeed found in the
previous analytical analysis. On the other hand, for m0 ∼ 0 eV., in the IH, the breaking is
>
∼ 0.05 eV., which
at least of 30%. Finally, and more interesting, one can see that for m0
corresponds to the almost degenerate hierarchy, the breaking can, as a matter of fact, be less

than 10%. Therefore, this indicates that DH is the most favoured hierarchy for regarding
µ − τ as a good approximated symmetry.

It is worth noticing, however, that yet larger values for the breaking parameters are

possible even in the DH case, as it is clear from the ﬁgure. Imposing the phenomenological

requirement of a truly small amount of breaking, as the theoretical hint of a perturbative
origin would suggest, has the eﬀect of cutting oﬀ all parameter space above Max[|ˆδ|,|ˆǫ|] > 0.1,
or any other chosen small value. Of course, this can only be done by excluding those values

for the CPVP that were only consistent with larger amounts for the symmetry breaking.

signs) corresponds to the 3 σ interval, and blue color (stars) corresponds to central values (cv) of
the mixing parameters, that match with Max[|ˆδ|, |ˆǫ|]≤ 0.25. In the right hand plot the green color
(cross signs) corresponds to Max[|ˆδ|, |ˆǫ|]≤ 0.1 and the red color (plus signs) to Max[|ˆδ|, |ˆǫ|]≤ 0.25,
with the experimental values varied within 3 σ.

Therefore, one is moved to conclude that a small µ − τ symmetry breaking would imply
more speciﬁc values for the CP phases, as we will discuss next.

III. MAJORANA PHASES AND µ − τ SYMMETRY

In previous section it was shown that current experimental data indicates that the re-

quirement of a small symmetry breaking favours the quasi-degenerated mass hierarchy, i.e.
>
∼ 0.05 eV. According to that we will take m0 = 0.1 eV hereafter. We note, however, that
our results do not change signiﬁcantly if we consider other value for m0 within that range.

m0

This can be understood as a consequence that Eqs. (2.10) to (2.12), that ultimately deﬁne

the breaking parameters (see Eq. 2.4), have no explicit dependence on the absolute neutrino

mass scale, whatsoever, in this limit. Nevertheless, we will made use of the exact expressions

in (2.4) and (2.5) for our numerical analysis, avoiding any further approximation.

Once m0 has been chosen, ˆδ and ˆǫ shall only depend on the 3 CPVP. Thus, by picking

up a suitable value of the Dirac phase, δCP , one would obtain some information about the

remaining two Majorana phases that fulﬁll the requirement for a small symmetry breaking.

9

In summary, any two given values for the phases will provide a unique set of absolute

breaking parameters, and vice versa. Therefore, only a well deﬁne allowed region in CP

phase space would be consistent with our symmetry breaking requirement. The results of

our numerical exploration show this, and are depicted in Fig. 2, where in its left hand side

the allowed region for the two Majorana phases, β1 and β2, which match with the condition
Max[|ˆδ|, |ˆǫ|]≤ 0.25 is shown. To elaborate this plot we choose δCP = −π/2, which is near
to best ﬁt value reported in [1, 2], nevertheless, in the plots below we will consider diﬀerent

values for δCP . Other mixing parameters were varied up to 1 σ, and 3 σ, from their central

values. Corresponding regions are as indicated in the ﬁgure. One can easily see that there

exist a strong correlation between the two Majorana phases, as it can be inferred from the
expressions in Eqs. (2.10 - 2.12), where the relative phase β1 − β2 appears. The reader can
ﬁnd in this ﬁgure that the values β1 = π and β2 = π/2, discussed in the previous section
and that lead to Max[|ˆδ|, |ˆǫ|]≈ 0.2, are well contained within the regions. An interesting
outcome that we would like to stress is that null Majorana phases are completely excluded

at 3σ level. Furthermore, as it can be seen on the same plot, allowed region is not largely

modiﬁed when we move the experimental values from 1 to 3σ deviation limits. This means

that the correlation is just slightly sensitive to mixing angle variations. In contrast, as it is

shown on the right hand plot of same Fig. 2, when one restricts even more the upper bound
condition on Max[|ˆδ|,|ˆǫ|], the allowed region for β1 and β2 is greatly reduced. Therefore,
in this framework it is indeed possible to restrict the CPVP and, according to the analysis

made in the last section, the pattern of masses. We believe this would be useful for future
works based on an approximated µ − τ symmetry.

Finally, in order to study the dependence of our results on the chosen value for the Dirac

phase, we have run our analysis for diﬀerent values of it. We have found a strong correlation

of the allowed Majorana phase space with Dirac CP phase. A couple of distinctive output

examples are presented in Fig. 3, where the values of β1 and β2 that match the condition
Max[|ˆδ|, |ˆǫ|]≤ 0.25, for δCP = 0 and δCP = −π/4 (left and right hand side, respectively)
are shown. From Figs. 2 and 3, it can be seen that, in any of those cases, equal Majorana

phases are totally disfavoured for a small breaking, as discussed in Sec. II. In particular,

simultaneously null Majorana phases remain excluded in any of the analysed cases. Also,

it can be noticed that, indeed, the two Majorana phases are sensitive to variations on the

Dirac CP phase. This is expected from Eqs. (2.10-2.12), due to fact that δCP appears as

the small µ − τ breaking hypothesis: a near future determination of the Dirac CP phase
would provide speciﬁc predictions for the allowed values of Majorana phases, making the
near µ − τ symmetric limit testable.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have made a complete numerical analysis of the two dimensionless parameters ˆδ and
ˆǫ that encode µ − τ symmetry breaking. By taking neutrino oscillation mixings and mass
scales as indicated by the experiments, those breaking parameters would only depend on

four free variables: the lightest neutrino mass, m0, the Dirac CP phase, δCP , and the two
Majorana phases. By allowing all three CP-violating phases to vary within the [0 − 2π]
interval, we have studied the absolute values of both ˆδ, and ˆǫ parameters in order to size the
<
breaking of µ−τ as a function of m0. From this analysis, it turns out that for m0
∼ 0.02 eV.,
in the NH, the µ − τ symmetry would be broken by more than a 50%. In the case of IH, on
the other hand, we have found that for m0 = 0 eV. the breaking is always larger than a 30%.

However this limit decreases when m0 increases, regardless of the hierarchy. This clearly
indicates that only in the almost degenerated neutrino masses limit, when m0 >
∼ 0.05 eV.,
one can obtain a breaking as small as a 1%. Therefore, we may conclude that whereas
current neutrino data is consistent with an approximated µ− τ symmetry, the truly near to

11

symmetry limit does prefer the quasidegenerate active neutrino spectrum.

Following above given conclusion, we restricted the analysis to the large absolute neutrino

>

∼ 0.1 eV, and then focused only on the parameter space where |ˆδ|,
mass range, that is for m0
|ˆǫ| are eﬀectively small to explore allowed CP phases. Remarkably, our analysis shows that
the smallness of the breaking parameters is quite independent on the speciﬁc value taken

by m0, however, their size is strongly governed by the CP-violating phases, which appear

to be strongly correlated among themselves, to the point that a given value of the Dirac

phase should predict a well bounded allowed parameter space for Majorana phases. The

allowed values for this last are slightly sensitive to the variations on oscillation mixings and

mass scales, up to 3σ level, but they are, as expected, very much dependent on the allowed

maximum values for breaking parameters.

Finally, from our analysis we can extract two important conclusions. First, equal Majo-
rana CP phases necessarily lead to a strong breaking of µ − τ symmetry. This also implies
that if µ − τ is to be regarded as a good approximated symmetry, Majorana phases would
deﬁnitively be non zero. Second, a future determination of Dirac phase, will largely restrict
the Majorana phases that can be compatible with the condition of a weak breaking of µ− τ .
Experiments looking for the Dirac phase, neutrinoless double beta decay, together with an

improvement in the precision determination on the mixing angles, would certainly provide
worthy information to support or rule out the scenario for a small µ− τ symmetry breaking.
