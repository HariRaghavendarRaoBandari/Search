Abstract

The eﬀect of the frame dragging on the equation of motions, depends on the approaches that
have been considered. Accordingly, additional force terms may appear or disappear. To understand
the eﬀect of radial and non-radial perturbations that may exist in the case of mass distribution
of spherical shell form, modiﬁcations should be predicted to the approaches of the components of
elastic tensor E µν given in Bass and Pirani[8]. Diﬀerent relations between ω and ω ′ have been
discussed.

Introduction

Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GR) predicts many astronomical phenomena (Einstein, 1916a,
1916b, 1918). Frame dragging eﬀect is one of the prediction of GR and ﬁrst studied by J. Lense and H.
Thirring [4][5][6] This eﬀect is mainly deform and drag the spacetime around rotating massive objects.
Gravity Probe B gyroscopes have detected frame dragging eﬀect around the Earth [7] By using a linear
approach method Hans Thirring [5][6] gives the eﬀect of spherical mass distribution with a radius a
that rotates with a constant ω speed around an axis, on the equation of motions as

where χ = 8πk; k is the gravity constant and dV0 is the spatial volume element. There is an in-
consistency, on the other hand, between Thirring’s assumptions because of the violation of energy -
momentum conservation law:

sistency.

T µν = ρvµvν + Eµν

In their calculation they used the approach that Thirring applied on the metric tensor components.
In addition, they deﬁne the mass density of the spherical shell in the form of ρ(θ) = ρ0(1+N a2ω2 sin2 θ)
which depends on the latitude. When the constant term N assumed to be N=1, then this corresponds
to a mass distribution that compansates for the spherial relativistic mass increase and represents a
uniform mass distribution in the reference frame where the shell is rotating.

2 A new additional term in the solution

In the work of Bass and Pirani [8] the approaches on the elastic energy–momentum terms Eµν can
be modiﬁed. Energy-momentum conservation equation, T µν
;ν = 0, estimations examiations reveal that
only the Eµν components lattitude depended partial derivation have been taken into consideration.
This means that the frame dragging eﬀects, that may arise due to radial and non–radial mass ﬂuc-
tuations on the spherical shell have been neglected. In addition, the estimation of the γ ′
44 and γ ′
24
perturbation terms in the metric components, the value of ( dx4
ds )2 according to the ω term for dif-
ferent series approaches cause variations in the equation of motion. When γ ′
24 terms are
estimated with second order (S2 ) and ﬁrst order (S1 ) approaches (which is Thirring’s approach) than
the equation of motions are found as

The relation of ω′ angular velocity of a particle with the ω that has been presented in Thirring [5]
has not ben considered in the work of Bass and Pirani [8]. We can get this relation without changing
any conditions that have been applied to the elastic tensor Eµν as

3 Results

In this work, we study the partial derivation of the elastic tensor Eµν that appears in the energy–
momentum conservation equations, T µν
;ν = 0, and in other relations that depends on it. We also aim
to study other coordinate derivatives in addition to the latitude dependence that has been studied
in [8]. Therefore, radial and non–radial perturbation ﬂuctuations that may occur in the shell mass
distribution will be studied. Moreover, we will work on the posible solutions of equation of motion
by taking diﬀerent approaches into account. Therefore, the relation of space–time frame dragging
with diﬀerent types of pulsations will be analysed in details. In the work of [8], ω and ω′ dragging
coeﬃcient relation presented in [5] has been investigated. In this study, diﬀerent relations between
ω and ω′ have been discussed. In our future work, we plan to study the eﬀect of frame dragging on
the neutron star interiors, binary stars with a neutron star and on the gravitational waves which is
recently detected by LIGO [9].
