Abstract

A new hybrid experiment has been constructed to measure the chemical com-
position of cosmic rays around the “knee” in the wide energy range by the Tibet
ASγ collaboration at Tibet, China, since 2014. They consist of a high-energy
air-shower-core array (YAC-II), a high-density air-shower array (Tibet-III) and a
large underground water-Cherenkov muon-detector array (MD). In order to ob-
tain the primary proton, helium and iron spectra and their “knee” positions in
the energy range lower than 1016 eV, each of PMTs equipped to the MD cell is
required to measure the number of photons capable of covering a wide dynamic
range of 100 - 106 photoelectrons (PEs) according to Monte Carlo simulations.
In this paper, we ﬁrstly compare the characteristic features between R5912-PMT
made by Japan Hamamatsu and CR365-PMT made by Beijing Hamamatsu. This
is the ﬁrst comparison between R5912-PMT and CR365-PMT. If there exists no
serious diﬀerence, we will then add two 8-inch-in-diameter PMTs to meet our re-
quirements in each MD cell, which are responsible for the range of 100 - 10000 PEs

and 2000 - 1000000 PEs, respectively. That is, MD cell is expected to be able to
measure the number of muons over 6 orders of magnitude.

Introduction

The energy spectrum of cosmic rays is well described by a power law over a wide en-
ergy range covering more than 10 decades; this is regarded as a remarkable feature of
the nonthermal acceleration mechanism of high-energy cosmic rays. The power index
suddenly steepens from approximately -2.7 to -3.1 at around 4×1015 eV, resulting in a
distinctive “knee” shape in the spectrum [1] [2]. The origin of the “knee” is an outstand-
ing problem in astroparticle physics [3] [4]. A lot of models have been proposed such
as a change of acceleration mechanisms at the sources of cosmic rays (supernova rem-
nants, pulsars, etc.), to a single-source assumption or eﬀects due to propagation inside
the galaxy (diﬀusion, drift, escape from the Galaxy), and some unknown new processes
in the atmosphere during air-shower development [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. Hence, in order to
resolve the origin of the knee, it is needed to observe the break point of the spectral
index for individual chemical component [3] [10] [11].

In 2014, an important upgrade of the Tibet ASγ project was completed. They con-
sist of an air-shower-core array (YAC-II), a high-density air-shower array (Tibet-III) and
a large underground water-Cherenkov muon-detector array (MD) [12] [13]. For an air
shower event, the Tibet-III provides the arrival direction (θ) and the air shower size (Ne)
which are interrelated to primary energy, the YAC-II measures the high energy electro-
magnetic particles in the core region so as to obtain the characteristic parameters of
air-shower cores, at the same time, the underground MDs record the high-energy muons
above 1 GeV. The MD array now consists of 5 pools set up 2.5 meters underground, each
with 16 cells, covering a total area of 4500 m2. Each cell of the MD array is composed of
a concrete water tank with a cubic form of 7.2 m wide, 7.2 m long, 1.5 m deep and two
20-inch PMTs (R3600) are mounted downward on the ceiling. The method for obtain-
ing the light-component spectrum of primary cosmic rays at the “knee” energies with
the Tibet experiment is described in the paper [12] [14]. In order to explicitly observe
the break point of the spectrum for individual chemical component, we need to observe
primary particles with energy up to 1016 eV. According to Monte Carlo simulation, a set
of two PMTs in each MD cell is required to measure the number of photons over a wide
dynamic range from 100 to 106 photoelectrons (PEs), as shown in Fig.1.

In this paper, we ﬁrstly compare the characteristic features between R5912-PMT
made by Japan Hamamatsu and CR365-PMT made by Beijing Hamamatsu. This is
the ﬁrst comparison between R5912-PMT and CR365-PMT. Since it is the ﬁrst time for

Beijing Hamamatsu to produce this type of 8-inch-in-diameter PMTs, so it is needed to
test the performance of PMTs whether they are intend to satisfy our request, also to
provide valuable feedback to the company producing them. Then, we use a set of two
PMTs and measure the linearity of the PMT response as a function of the light intensity
to meet our requirements.

2 The experimental setup

In order to study the performance of these PMTs, the following quantities have been
measured:

1)photoelectron spectra ,
2)gain as a function of high voltage,
3)dark count rate,
4)linearity of PMT output signals,
5)dynamic range of PMT.
The entire test system is mainly composed of Pulse Generator (Agilent Technolo-
gies 81160A), Laser (PiL044SM-SN-513B), Filter, High Voltage power supply (CAEN
N1470), Gate Generator (ORTEC GG8020), Low Threshold Discriminator (CAEN N845),
Scaler (ORTEC 772 counter), ADC (Lecroy 2249A, the resolution is 0.25 pC/count), and
data acquisition (DAQ) computer. The test system is schematically shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Schematic view of the test system. When we measure 1),2), 4)and 5), the
signals from the PMT are then fed into a charge-integrating ADC in a camac crate
where they are measured and then read out by the DAQ computer; when we measure
3), the signals from the PMT are then fed into a low threshold discriminator and then
into a scaler.

The light source used for this test was a pico second laser (Pil044SM-SN-513B) which
has very narrow pulse width and high stability. Signal frequency applied to the laser
is controlled by the pulse generator (ﬁxed) and the light intensity is controlled by the
control box (variable). At the same time, the pulse generator generates the NIM signals
to use as triggers. Before reaching the PMT, the light passed through neutral density
attenuation ﬁlters. With diﬀerent ﬁlters, we were able to change the light intensity by
more than 5 orders of magnitude. When we measure 1),2), 4)and 5), the signals from
the PMT are then fed into a charge-integrating ADC in a camac crate where they are
measured and then read out by the DAQ computer; when we measure 3), the signals
from the PMT are then fed into a low threshold discriminator and then into a scaler.
All the analysis is then done on the computer.

3 Results

Using this test system, the single photoelectron (SPE) spectra, multi photoelectrons
spectra, gain as a function of voltage, dark count rate at 1/3 photoelectron (PE) threshold
and linearity of PMT output signals are measured for CR365 and R5912. Details of each
test are described in the following sections.

3.1 Single photoelectron spectra

In order to get the absolute gain of the PMT at a certain voltage, the SPE spectrum
is measured. Fig. 3 shows the SPE spectra for CR365 at 1500 V and R5912 at 1350

photoelectron.

V corresponding to ∼1.5×107 gain. The ﬁrst peak is the pedestal and the second peak
is due to 1 photoelectron events. To quantify the resolution of the single photoelectron
spectrum, the peak to valley ratio is used. The peak to valley ratio is the ratio of the
maximum value of the histogram of the SPE spectrum to the minimum value between
the pedestal and the maximum. The SPE peak to valley ratio for CR365 and R5912
are both close to 2 which indicate that both PMTs have a good charge resolution for
detecting single photoelectron.

3.2 Multi photoelectron spectra

We also measured multiple photoelectrons (multi-PEs) spectra for CR365 and R5912
both at 1800V as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Here, the resolution of ADC is 0.25
pC/count. A multi-gaussian ﬁt was carried out in equation (1), Npe is the average multi-
PEs number,σ is standard deviation of multi-PEs, C is the ADC count of multi-PEs [15].
From Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we ﬁnd the multi-PEs spectra of CR365 and R5912 can be well
reproduced by this multi-gaussian function.
It means that both PMTs have a good
charge resolution for detecting multi photoelectrons.

Voltage(V)

Figure 6: The absolute gain for CR365 and R5912 as a function of high voltage. The
gain of R5912 is about three times of that CR365 at 1800V.

3.3 Gain as a function of high voltage

An important feature is the gain curve with respect to the supplied high voltage (HV).
To get the gain as a function of high voltage, the laser light intensity has been ﬁxed
while the PMT HV has been varied. The relationship between gain (G) and input high
voltage (V) is described by

G = αV β

(2)

with α and β to be determined from measurements. The ﬁt parameters are β=8.96±0.10
for R5912, β=8.27±0.06 for CR365, respectively. The absolute gain for each PMT was
measured at a known voltage from the SPE spectrum, and this can be used to convert
this relative gain measurement into an absolute one. Fig. 6 shows the absolute gain for
CR365 and R5912 which is about three times of that CR365 at 1800V.

3.4 Dark count rate

The dark count rate is the rate at which signals above a certain threshold are observed
in a PMT while no light incident on the photocathode. There is a correlation between
dark pulse rate and the lifetime of a PMT, and the smaller noise of a PMT, the longer
its lifetime becomes. To check the dark noise, the data of R5912 and CR365 have been
compared. Of course, to know the magnitude of the 1/3 PE threshold for a PMT, the
absolute gain of the PMT must be known. The anode dark rate after 2 hours in dark

for R5912, respectively.

at a gain of ∼1.5×107 are both less than 3k Hz when the thresholds are set at 1/3
photoelectron.

3.5 Linearity of PMT

In order to extend the dynamic range of MD from 100 PEs to 106 PEs, the linearity of
the PMT output signals is essentially important. In this work, the linearity of R5912 and
CR365 is measured by using laser light source and ﬁlters as shown in Fig.2. The light
intensity is varied by use of diﬀerent neutral density transmission ﬁlters and the corre-
sponding response is ﬁtted with a function y=axb where x is the relative transmission.
Fig.7 shows the linear behavior for CR365 at 1500V and R5912 at 1350V as a function
of input light corresponding to ∼ 1.5×107 gain. The points show the experimental data.
The lines are ﬁtting lines. The ﬁtting slope of CR365 is b=1.05±0.01 and the result of
R5912 is b=1.03±0.01. In this paper, the maximum linear current is deﬁned as the peak
current where the deviation from the ideal linear current reaches ±5%. From this ﬁgure,
we can ﬁnd that a peak linear current of CR365 is approximately 100 mA and R5912
almost achieved about 130 mA. In order to compare the characteristics of the 8-inch
PMTs obviously, we selected two PMTs with a relatively high gain in the above tests.
However, if we want to measure the number of photoelectrons up to 106, we will select
proper PMTs with a lower gain in the following tests, as discussed in the next section.

3.6 Extend the dynamic range of MD

Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the highest energy showers may give rise to peak
signals as large as 106 PEs. The PMTs, therefore, must be linear up to such large signals.
In order to extend the dynamic range of MD from 100 PEs to 106 PEs, we are planning
to add two 8-inch PMTs in each MD cell which are responsible for the range of 100 -
10000 PEs and 2000 - 1000000 PEs, respectively. First of all, we selected a CR365-A
PMT with a ∼106 gain at 1500V to ensure the linearity in the dynamic range of 100 -
10000 PEs. Then, with the increase of amount of incident light, we use a 1% ﬁlter to
reduce the the input light of CR365-B which also has a ∼106 gain at 1500V to realize
a linear measurement of 2000 - 1000000 PEs. Fig.8 is the output signal of two CR365-
PMTs versus input light which can meet our requirements. That is, the MD is expected
to have the wide dynamic range in 6 orders of magnitude.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we compared the characteristic features between PMT R5912 and PMT
CR365. Our test experiments conﬁrmed that there exists no serious diﬀerence between
PMT CR365 and PMT R5912, and CR365 is within the speciﬁcations given by Beijing
Hamamatsu. This is the ﬁrst comparison between R5912 and CR365. We then tested

9

the linearity of the PMT response by varying the light intensities and found that they
satisfy our requirements with respect to the MD having the wide dynamic range in 6
orders of magnitude. In the near future, we will test the performance stability of this
type of PMT.
