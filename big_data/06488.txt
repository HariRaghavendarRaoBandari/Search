ABSTRACT

We have analyzed data from Campaigns 0-5 of the K2 mission and report 19 ultra-short period
candidate planets with orbital periods of less than 1 day (nine of which have not been previously
reported). The planet candidates range in size from 0.7-16 Earth radii and in orbital period from 4.2 to
23.5 hours. One candidate (EPIC 203533312, Kp=12.5) is among the shortest-period planet candidates
discovered to date, and, if conﬁrmed as a planet, must have a density of at least ρ = 8.9 g/cm3 in
order to not be tidally disrupted. Four candidates have nominal radius values in the sub-Jovian desert
(RP = 3 − 11 R⊕ and P ≤ 1.5 days) where theoretical models do not favor their long-term stability;
the only conﬁrmed planet in this range is in fact thought to be disintegrating (EPIC 201637175).
A candidate Hot Jupiter, meanwhile, would at P = 13.6 hours be the shortest-period hot Jupiter
identiﬁed, although the faintness of its host star (Kp = 17.89) makes additional follow-up diﬃcult. In
addition to the planet candidates, we followed four objects which may not be planetary. One is EPIC
211152484, which has intermittent transits that are only visible during about half of the observing
campaign, and whose true nature is unclear. Three other initially promising candidates are likely false
positives based on characteristics of their light curves and on radial velocity follow-up. A list of all
91 eclipsing binaries identiﬁed at various stages in our vetting process is also provided. Based on an
assessment of our survey’s completeness, we estimate an occurrence rate for ultra-short period planets
among K2 target stars that is about half that estimated from the Kepler sample, raising questions as
to whether the K2 systems are intrinsically diﬀerent from the Kepler systems, possibly as a result of
their diﬀerent galactic location.

1.

INTRODUCTION

Planets with orbital periods of less than a day present
real challenges to theories of planet formation and evo-
lution, and yet numerous objects with periods as short
as a few hours have been found.
So close to their
host stars that some are actively disintegrating (Sanchis-
Ojeda et al. 2015), these planets’ origins remain unclear,
and even modiﬁed models for planet formation and evo-
lution with signiﬁcant inward migration have trouble ac-
counting for their periods. They thus present an impor-
tant test for theories of planetary origins and evolution.
The existence of such a population was suggested by
several groups. For instance, Jackson et al. (2009),
among others, suggested that orbital decay driven by
tides raised on the host star could drive planets into
very short-period orbits, but how they arrived within
orbits susceptible to tidal decay is unclear. Raymond
et al. (2008) explored diﬀerent possibilities, from in situ
formation to Type-1 gas disk migration. That study
suggested the orbital architectures of the systems, along
with the physical properties of the planets, could help
distinguish between the possible origin scenarios. For
instance, Type-1 migration would be expected to move
multiple, small planets together into short-period orbits

adams@psi.edu

with the planets forming a chain of mean-motion (or near
mean-motion) resonances (MMRs). The magnetosphere
of a young star is thought to clear a cavity within a few
stellar radii of the star, and so the inward migration is
expected to cease shortly after entering that cavity, de-
positing a migrating planet into an orbital period of a
few days (Lin et al. 1996).

Among the discoveries reported in Sanchis-Ojeda et al.
(2014) are several multi-planet systems, and in some
cases, the outer pairs of planets are near MMRs. For
example, the KOI-1843 system includes two outer plan-
ets, with P ≈ 4 and 6 days, within 1% of the 3:2 MMR.
The innermost planet, KOI-1843.03 has an orbital period
P = 4 hours, more than 75 Hill radii from its nearest sib-
ling, and so presumably is dynamically decoupled. How-
ever, tidal decay could potentially explain KOI-1843.03’s
present precarious orbit, especially if interactions with
the other two planets excited its orbital eccentricity and
enhancing driving tidal decay (Van Laerhoven 2014). In-
deed, KOI-1843.03 is so close to its host star (≈ 2 stel-
lar radii) that the planet currently orbits within space
originally occupied by its host star early in the system’s
history. Thus, it must have arrived at its present orbit
long after the system’s formation. Many of the ultra-
short-period (USP) planet and candidates occupy similar
orbits and therefore tidal damping seems likely to have

2

played a role in shaping their orbits.

Whatever the planets’ origins, the properties of the
host stars seem related to the planets’ occurrence rate.
Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014) found marginal evidence that
M-dwarfs are about 10 times as likely as F-dwarfs to host
a planet with a radius twice that of Earth’s and P ≤ 24
hours. This trend is qualitatively similar to but more
pronounced than the trend discussed in Howard et al.
(2012) but disagrees with that discussed in Fressin et al.
(2013), who found no dependence of the occurrence rate
on stellar type; however, neither study considered USP
planets.

Presumably, the properties of the host stars play a role
in the planet formation process itself but probably also
shape evolution of the planetary system. For instance,
if stars of all types were equally likely to host a planet,
tidal decay of a planet’s orbit should occur more quickly
for more massive, larger stars. The inﬂuence of the tide
raised on the star rapidly increases stellar radius, and
the inﬂuence of the tide raised on the planet scales with
stellar mass. On the other hand, if Type-1 migration is,
indeed, responsible for bringing small planets close-in,
then planets orbiting M-dwarfs might start their tidal
journey closer to the star, and therefore be more suscep-
tible to tidal decay.

Unfortunately, the small sample size of USP plane-
tary candidates reported in Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014)
around M-dwarfs (six) and F-dwarfs (nine) makes it diﬃ-
cult to draw statistically robust inferences regarding the
dependences of USP planet occurrence rate. Thankfully,
the reincarnation of the Kepler Mission as K2 provides
an ideal opportunity to continue the search for USP plan-
ets. Although K2´s 80-day dwell time on each target ﬁeld
makes ﬁnding longer period planet diﬃcult, USPs are
easily detectable as a transiting planet with P = 4 hours
occults its host star almost 480 times in 80 days.

In this paper we report on the ongoing eﬀorts of
the Short-Period Planets Group (SuPerPiG, http://
www.astrojack.com/research/superpig/) to ﬁnd ad-
ditional short-period planets in the K2 mission data,
using the light curve products produced by the k2sﬀ
pipeline of Vanderburg & Johnson (2014).
In Section
2, we detail how we processed the K2 data and our tran-
sit search and model-ﬁtting. In Section 3, we present our
candidates, discuss their occurrence rate and the prop-
erties of their host stars. We also quantify our survey’s
completeness. In Section 5, we discuss future prospects
and the possibilities for follow-up observations.

2. DATA CONDITIONING AND TRANSIT SEARCH

The process applied here follows closely that in Jackson
et al. (2013), and we veriﬁed its eﬃcacy by recovering
the disintegrating planet EPIC 201637175 b reported in
Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2015). Figure 1 illustrates our data
conditioning and transit search process as applied to that
dataset. We also recovered synthetic transits that we
injected into the data to test our survey’s completeness,
as described in Section 4.

We retrieved the k2sﬀ publicly available data gener-
ated by the pipeline described in Vanderburg & Johnson
(2014) for all targets from the MAST archive for cam-
paigns 0 to 5, C0-C5. (Two objects in C0, 202093417
and 202137146, were not used because the ﬂux returned
from MAST was uniformly -1.) An advantage to using

Fig. 1.— Our data conditioning and transit search process as ap-
plied to the EPIC 201637175 dataset from K2 Campaign 1, which
was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2015). (a) The raw
k2sﬀ data. (b) The k2sﬀ data after applying a median boxcar ﬁl-
ter with width of 1-day. (c) The resulting EEBLS spectrum with
the best-ﬁt period hightlighted by a dashed, red line. (d) The de-
trended data from (b), folded on the best-ﬁt period and binned
into 200 bins for display. Note (a) and (b) share x-axes, but (c)
and (d) do not.

the Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) pipeline is that it cor-
rects for the pointing drift of the K2 spacecraft and gen-
erates light curves for several diﬀerent photometric aper-
tures, with a “best aperture” corresponding to the aper-
ture giving the smallest RMS variation in the ﬁnal light
curve. For our initial search, we used the best aperture
light curves (the “BESTAPER” extension in the FITS
ﬁles) for the targets available (7,746 in C0, 21,647 in C1,
13,401 in C2, 16,375 in C3, 24,475 in C4, and 15,779 in
C5). The processed data for EPIC 201637175 from C1
(previously discovered by Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2015) are
shown in Figure 1 (a).

These light curves still exhibit a variety of astrophys-
ical and instrumental variations that act as sources of
noise for our analysis, but most of that variability is
on timescales longer than the periods of interest for our
search. To mitigate these variations, we applied a median
boxcar ﬁlter with a width of 1-day. The original data
have an almost regular observing cadence of 30-min with
a few small gaps, so we ﬁrst linearly interpolated the light
curves to a grid with a completely regular sampling of 30-
min and then calculated the median value for all points
within an 1-day window of each regularly-gridded point
to generate our ﬁlter. We then interpolated this ﬁlter
back to the time grid of the original data, restoring the
original time gaps, and subtracted this interpolated ﬁlter
from the original data. To improve detection eﬃciency
for the shallowest transits, we masked out the handful of
data points lying more than 10-σ from the dataset me-
dian, where the standard deviation σ ≡ 1.4826 × the me-
dian absolute deviation (Leys et al. 2013). (For deeper

EEBLS, shown for Campaign 2, with the strength of the EEBLS
signal at the peak as scaled by each spectrum’s σ. Residual eﬀects
of the thruster ﬁring period can be seen in an artiﬁcial pileup at
47 hours (8x), and spurious signals, which don’t resemble actual
transit light curves, remain in all campaigns at multiples (typically
1x and 8x) of the thruster period.

transits where a 10-σ cutoﬀ removes real data from in
transits, the truncated transits are still easily detected,
and the lightcurves were regenerated with the noise ﬁlter
set to 50-σ before ﬁtting to get the correct transit param-
eters.) The resulting detrended data for EPIC 201637175
are shown in Figure 1 (b).

Using these data, we searched for short-period plane-
tary transits with the EEBLS algorithm (Kov´acs et al.
2002). Brieﬂy, the EEBLS algorithm folds and bins
data on trial orbital periods and, considering all rele-
vant phases for a given period, returns the best-ﬁt to a
square wave at that period. (The original EEBLS algo-
rithm report best-ﬁt periods correspond to positive or
negative square waves, i.e.
it doesn’t care whether the
best-ﬁt signal is a dip or a blip. We modiﬁed the algo-
rithm slightly to report best-ﬁt periods only for dips.)
We started searching for transit signals with periods P
between 3 hrs (an orbit near the surface of the Sun) and
3 days (although we are only interested in periods of 1
day or less, the longer initial search threshold is useful
to avoid aliases). We used 10,000 trial periods, 100 bins
into which data folded on a trial period were binned, and
sought transits with durations between 1% and 50% of
the trial orbital period. With so many trial periods, the
results at one period are not linearly independent from
another (cf. Kov´acs et al. 2002), but that consideration
does not aﬀect whether we recover a transit. Moreover,
given the short durations expected ((cid:46) 1 hour), such a
ﬁne gridding is required to recover transits. This anal-
ysis produced an EEBLS spectrum for each target, an
example of which is shown for EPIC 201637175 in Fig-
ure 1 (c) with a clear peak at P ≈ 9 hours.

Figure 2 shows the best-ﬁt periods for candidate transit

threshhold are plotted in small gray points, while the 5444 larger
red points are those with plausible-enough depths and durations
relative to the period to warrant further inspection. The 19 planet
candidates that survived subsequent scrutiny are marked by black

signals from all 13,401 EEBLS spectra in C2 (other quar-
ters are similar) and the strength of the EEBLS signal at
the peak as scaled by each spectrum’s σ. The thruster
on-board the Kepler spacecraft ﬁres to maintain point-
ing at a period of Pthruster = 5.88460 hours, and mindful
of the problems it can cause in identifying short period
planets (Vanderburg & Johnson 2014), we have masked
it out by removing points ﬂagged ‘MOVING’ in the k2sﬀ
data. However, in all campaigns even after masking the
thruster points, there remains a strong peak at 47 hours
(or 8 times the thruster period), as well as a peak at the
thruster period itself. These spurious signals do not pass
into the ﬁnal candidate pool, however, since they do not
pass the SNR and duration threshholds.
To identify candidate transiting planets, we focused
on those with EEBLS spectral peaks ≥ 10-σ and periods
less than one day, giving 757, 505, 1251, 419, 1480, and
1032 candidates in C0-C5, respectively. We then applied
a generous ﬁrst-pass depth requirement, requiring tran-
sit depths D ≤ 0.25, which corresponds to the largest
known planet (2 RJ ) transiting a 0.4 R(cid:12) M-dwarf. All
initial detections with depths from 0.02-0.25 (about 10
per campaign) proved on inspection to be either clear
eclipsing binaries or else misidentiﬁed stellar noise. We
also required durations τ short enough to be consistent
with FGK host star main-sequence densities ρ∗ (Seager

with Γ = 0.00363 (Jackson et al. 2013). An extra hour
(or two K2 exposure times) was added to account for
the distortion introduced into the light curves by K2´s
30-min observing cadence, which artiﬁcially extends the
apparent transit duration and makes the transits more
V-shaped than is typical for planetary transits.

2.1. Initial Vetting

The candidates that meet the depth and duration cut-
oﬀs (91, 42, 177, 47, 152, and 134 for C0-C5) were in-
spected by hand. Candidates were vetted in the follow-
ing manner: ﬁrst, obvious sinusoids and light curves that
were clearly just noise were rejected, leaving 7, 18, 13,
20, 25, and 37 candidate transits or eclipsing binaries
per campaign. Obvious eclipsing binaries (two transit
signals of diﬀerent depths, occurring about half an or-
bital period apart) were also set aside at this point, al-
though see Table 1 for the EPIC number and period for
the eclipsing binaries identiﬁed throughout the search.
Candidates with deep transits were rerun through EE-
BLS with a more permissive noise ﬁlter (50-σ) to correct

our estimate of the transit depth before proceeding. A
few other light curves (0, 0, 2, 2, 1, and 2, respectively)
with odd patterns of photometric or stellar noise were
investigated by hand to be sure they were not missed
transits (none were). The stellar parameters for all re-
maining planet candidates are shown in Table 2, with 1,
4, 2, 5, 7, and 4 candidates, in C0-C5, respectively; 4 can-
didates (all in C4) that have some questionable features
are listed separately from the rest in Table 4.

The focus of this paper is on the shortest period plan-
ets (less than one day). However, it is common for plan-
ets with slightly longer periods to be misidentiﬁed at a
shorter alias if only the shortest periods are examined.
To account for this aliasing, we ran the initial EEBLS
search for periods from 3-72 hours, but folded and binned
the data using the period with the largest BLS spectral
peak and that was less than 24 hours. This process elim-
inated the cases of mis-identiﬁed transiting planet candi-
dates, although about half of the eclipsing binary signals
proved to be aliases on closer examination. To ensure
we had identiﬁed the correct period, we also folded all
candidates’ data at 0.5, 2, and 4 times the initial period.
We then reﬁned the orbital periods by running a ﬁner
search of 10,000 trial periods between 98% and 102% of
the initial period to ﬁnd the values listed in Table 4; see
Section 2.3 for the derivation of the period errors.

2.2. Follow-up observations

We obtained reconnaissance spectra for 6 of the 7 can-
didates from C4 (omitting faint 210605073) with the Tull

Coud´e spectrograph (Tull et al. 1995) at the Harlan J.
Smith 2.7-m telescope at McDonald Observatory in De-
cember 2015. The exposure times ranged from 1200 to
4800 seconds, resulting in signal-to-noise ratios (S/N)
from 32 to 50 per resolution element at 5650˚A. We de-
termined stellar parameters for the host stars with the
spectral ﬁtting tool Kea (Endl & Cochran 2015). We also
determined absolute RVs by cross-correlating the spec-
tra with the RV-standard star HD 50692. Our results
are summarized in Table 3. Two observations on diﬀer-
ent nights were obtained of the relatively bright EPIC
210954046, ﬁnding large RV variations (over 20 km/s)
and indicating a likely stellar rather than planetary com-
panion.

2.3. Fitting Candidate Transits

Light curves were ﬁt assuming a transiting planet
model. The light curves were ﬁt in Python using
the algorithm from Mandel & Agol (2002), as imple-
mented by the Batman package (Kreidberg 2015)1. We
used the pymodelﬁts2 and PyMC packages to conduct
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) transit analysis
using 100,000 iterations (discarding as burn-in the ﬁrst
1000 iterations and thinning the sample by a factor of
10). The results are shown in Table 4, with the quoted
1-σ error bars containing 68.3% of the posterior values.
With very short transit durations, there are only a few
observations per transit, resulting in considerable aver-
aging point-to-point in the observed light curves. The

https://pythonhosted.org/PyModelFit/core/pymodelfit.

core.FunctionModel1D.html

solution is to ﬁt the light curves using supersampling,
where each model point is an average of several points
spanning the half-hour exposure time. Since the time
to run each ﬁt scales directly with the number of points
used in supersampling, we chose to use 7 points for can-
didates with 4 ≤ P ≤ 24 hour periods and 11 points for
the very shortest with P < 4 hours.

The EPIC catalog does not provide stellar radius val-
ues, so we estimated them via other means. For all but
C4, we used the K2-TESS Stellar Properties Catalog3 for
the stellar temperatures. For C4, we were able to obtain
spectra (see Section 2.2) and directly measure Teﬀ , ex-
cept for one very faint candidate (210605073) that also
was not in the K2-TESS catalog; we estimated its stellar
type from photometric ugriz colors (see Section 3.4) and
assigned it a temperature of 7020 K. For all other stars
we derived stellar radii from Teﬀ using Boyajian et al.
(2012, their Equation 4 and Table 10). The calculated er-
rors on the stellar radius are included in the estimates of
planetary radius. We calculated the quadratic limb dark-
ening coeﬃcients for the Kepler bandpass using Claret &
Bloemen (2011), where we ﬁxed metallicity [Fe/H] = 0,
microturbulent velocity = 0, and log(g) = 4.0.

Since a blend scenario with similarly sized eclipsing bi-
nary stars can resemble a transiting planet with half the
true period of the system, we separately ﬁt the odd and
even-numbered transits and compared the radius ratios
derived for each (Batalha et al. 2010). The diﬀerence be-
tween the depth of the odd and even transits, expressed
in terms of the errors, is shown in Table 4 as σodd−even.
All candidates with odd-even ratios greater than 3-σ were

assigned to be eclipsing binaries.

To further investigate the possibility of blend scenar-
ios for our candidates, we looked for correlations be-
tween photometric centroids and ﬂux variations – in-
transit shifts of the photocenter may indicate blending
with objects near the target star in the sky (Batalha
et al. 2010). As a proxy for photocenter positions, we
used the arclength parameter provided by Vanderburg &
Johnson (2014). We found no statistically signiﬁcant (3-
σ) photocenter variations in the arclength during transit
compared to out of transit for any of our candidates.

To estimate uncertainties on each candidate’s orbital
period, we ﬁt for the transit ephemeris. Since there are
too few points in any individual light curve to constrain
a transit ﬁt, consecutive transits were folded and binned
on a number n of orbital periods, with n large enough
to give the resulting binned transits suﬃcient S/N to be
analyzed. (We required n between 11 and 31 orbits for
our candidates.) Then each folded/binned transit was
ﬁt with a linear ephemeris, and the errors on the orbital
periods were assigned based on these ﬁts. (There was no
evidence of transit-timing variations for any of our can-
didates.) We used a similar procedure in Jackson et al.
(2013) and were able to recover the ephemerides assumed
for synthetic transits injected into real data from the Ke-
pler mission.

3. CANDIDATES

3.1. EPIC 206103150, a.k.a. WASP-47

EPIC 206103150 is the WASP-47 system, where a 4-
day hot Jupiter (Hellier et al. 2012) has recently been
found to be accompanied by a super-Earth at 0.8 days
(the candidate identiﬁed by this survey) and another
transiting planet at 9 days (Becker et al. 2015), as well
as a Jupiter-sized planet at ∼ 572 d (Neveu-VanMalle
et al. 2016). Clear evidence of the outer two transits is
seen in the folded light curve for the inner planet in Fig-
ure 4. This system provided a check on our detection
and characterization algorithms, particularly for multi-
ples; we saw no signs of additional planets among our
other candidate systems.

3.2. EPIC 203533312

is
The shortest-period candidate, EPIC 203533312,
around a bright star (Kp = 12.5) and has an orbital
period of 4.2 hours and radius of 1.92 ± 0.12 R⊕, which
is roughly consistent with a rocky/metallic composition.
Following the work of Rappaport et al. (2013), we can
estimate a minimum mass for the planet by requiring
that it is just exterior to its Roche limit. We ﬁnd
Mp ≥ 11.5 M⊕, giving a density of ρ = 8.9 g/cm3.
This candidate, from C2, was not identiﬁed in the
survey by Vanderburg et al. (2016), nor does it ap-
pear in the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog. Although
we have so far been unable to obtain follow-up data
due to its location in the sky, it is expected that ad-
ditional stellar observations are forthcoming since it is
part of the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (http:
//www.physics.usyd.edu.au/k2gap/).

3.3. Sub-Jovian Desert Candidates: EPIC 201637175,

202094740, 212150006, and 211995325

7

No conﬁrmed planets with radii between 3 and 11 R⊕
are known below a period of about 1.5 days (and that
radius range is underpopulated out to about 3 days).
This region in period-radius space has been referred to
as the sub-Jovian desert (Matsakos & K¨onigl 2016) and
corresponds to the size range in which a planet would
need to have signiﬁcant volatiles to match the observed
radius, which might be diﬃcult for the planets to re-
tain. One of our four candidates in this range of radii,
in fact,
is EPIC 201637175, the disintegrating planet
candidate of Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2015). Of the other
three, EPIC 211995325 has very large errors on its radius
(Rp = 3.23 ± 3.76 R⊕) due to the uncertain stellar size
(late M-dwarf) and the low S/N light curve (Kp = 18.2).
The remaining two, EPIC 202094740 and 212150006,
are prime targets for follow-up, even though they have
strong a priori odds of being false positives. Many
initially-promising candidates in this size range turn out
to be deeper eclipses that have been diluted to appear
planetary in size – see the three objects discussed in Sec-
tion 3.4.1. However, if EPIC 202094740 and 212150006
can be conﬁrmed as planets, they would be of great value
for understanding the stability and evolution of planets in
this size range. We note that although EPIC 212150006
appears in the Kepler EB catalog online, it appears with
erroneous values (see Section 3.5), so the status of this
object is uncertain.

3.4. EPIC 210605073

Candidate 210605073 is a 1% deep transit around
an extremely faint star (Kp = 17.9) with no stel-
Teﬀ and R(cid:12)) listed in the
lar parameters (e.g.
EPIC or TESS/Vanderbilt catalogs.
Based on the
broadband Sloan photometry provided on the K2 Ex-
oFOP (https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/edit_
target.php?id=210605073), the star has very neutral
to slightly blue colors (g − r = −0.037, g − i = −0.145,
and g − z = −0.266). Using Pinsonneault et al. (2012,
their Table 1) to estimate Teﬀ from Sloan colors, we ﬁnd
that the colors are just above the high-mass end of their
ﬁducial models, suggesting that the star is a bit larger
than 1.5 M(cid:12). We note however that no measurements
of the metallicity, log g, or photometric extinction are
available to better constrain the estimate. An F0 star
with M∗ = 1.7 M(cid:12) and R∗ = 1.3 R(cid:12) implies a candidate
radius of 14 R⊕, while (for comparison) an M-dwarf with
a stellar radius of 0.4 R(cid:12) implies a radius of 5 R⊕. Both
radius values are large enough that the candidate would
probably have a signiﬁcant volatile component (Adams
et al. 2008), and Roche-lobe overﬂow (Valsecchi et al.
2015) and/or photoevaporative mass loss (Lopez & Fort-
ney 2013) would likely have removed the atmosphere of
such a planet in a 13-hour orbital period. Thus, it seems
a priori unlikely this candidate is a planet, although ad-
ditional (and not likely forthcoming) data would be re-
quired to make a deﬁnitive judgment.

3.4.1. Likely EBs: out-of-transit variability for EPIC

210414957, 210754505, and 210954046

Although there are no signs of odd-even depth vari-
ations for any of the candidates in this paper, three of
them show variability in the out of transit portion of
their light curves, probably explained by a false positive
scenario. For EPIC 210414957 and 210754505, the out

of transit portion shows a sinusoidal pattern at twice the
period of the candidate transits, with transits occurring
at both peaks and troughs as seen in Figure 5 panels (a)
and (b). Such variability is typically due to ellipsoidal
variations, although for large hot planets a similar pat-
tern could be due to phase curve variations (e.g. υ And,
Harrington et al. 2006). If the undulation were due to the
phase variability of a large planet rotating through view,
we would expect that the transits would only occur at
same point in the variation (typically the troughs, when
no emission from the planet is seen). Both objects are
also in the so-called sub-Jovian desert, where stability of
their atmospheres is questionable.

The third object, EPIC 210954046, has out-of-transit
variability that more closely resembles a shallow sec-
ondary eclipse (see Figure 5 panel (c)). Follow-up RV
observations revealed an RV shift of more than 20 km/s
and indicate this candidate is a false positive (see Ta-
ble 3); the host star is also a fast rotator. In addition, a
nearby star at 2(cid:48)(cid:48) separation was seen in the McDonald
guide camera, lending more support to the idea that the
nominal 6 R⊕ transit is actually a diluted binary star.

3.4.2. Variable and disappearing: EPIC 211152484

The importance of examining the full time series, not
just the binned composite transit, is illustrated by EPIC
211152484. Although the period signal
in Figure 4
strongly resembles a transiting planet, it does so only
intermittently. There are no transits for about half of

the period of observation (see Figure 5), and when tran-
sits are visible, they have variable depths. The best ﬁt
reported in Table 4 is a ﬁt to all of the data and is
thus an average of transit depths; the deepest point (at
T = 2457082.4) corresponds to a radius ratio of 0.035, or
double the average. Possible explanations include some
kind of stellar variability, a rapidly-precessing cloud of
debris, or a disintegrating comet. A full examination
of this interesting object is beyond the scope of this
work. Additional data may be forthcoming as part of
the GO proposal from Charbonneau and colleagues to
characterize and provide masses for planets smaller than
2.5 R⊕ (http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/data/
k2-programs/GO4029.txt).

3.5. Eclipsing binaries

In the process of identifying transiting planet candi-
dates, 91 likely eclipsing binary stars were also identi-
ﬁed (Table 1). Eclipsing binaries with strongly dissimi-
lar depths were obvious on ﬁrst visual inspection of the
transit light curves, while those with more similar tran-
sit depths often initially were identiﬁed by EEBLS at
an alias of half the true period. Table 1 lists the EPIC
number and period for all eclipsing binaries, along with
a note for which were found at an alias of the true pe-
riod. Because of our focus on objects with periods of
under a day, the list of eclipsing binaries is not complete
for P > 1 day, and everything listed with a period of 1
day or more was originally identiﬁed at a shorter alias.

21041957 and 201754505, folded to four times the orbital period,
have signiﬁcant out-of-transit variation and the transits occur at
diﬀerent points in the sinusoidal pattern; this is a common feature
of similar-sized eclipsing binary light curves. (c) EPIC 210954046,
folded to the orbital period, has a sinusoidal pattern with a mini-
mum suggestive of a secondary around 0.5 orbital phase; coupled
with the large RV signature, this is a conﬁrmed false positive. (f)

the raw time series. The grey line shows a transit model with the
parameters in Table 4, scaled to the depth of the deepest point
(radius ratio = 0.035) which occurs around T=2457082; the red
dashed horizontal line shows the approximate time range during
which transit-like signals most frequently occurred.

It is also possible that some eclipsing binaries with pe-
riods less than one day were missed if they more closely
resembled sinusoidal noise.

We cross-correlated our list of eclipsing binaries with
the Kepler EB catalog (http://keplerebs.villanova.
edu/), which has been extended to include K2 targets
in the online Third Revision (Beta) updated 2015 Oct
26. Out of the 91 EBs listed in Table 1, 58 appear
in that catalog (although 4 appear at half the period
we identify), while 33 are new. Only two of the ultra-
short-period transiting planet candidates in Table 4 ap-
peared in the Kepler EB catalog, and it is unclear if
either truly belongs there: for EPIC 211685045, the sec-
ondary marked appears to be a glitch (3 points of noise
that happen to lie half an orbital phase from the tran-
sit, see http://keplerebs.villanova.edu/overview/
?k=211685045). EPIC 212150006 (which is a sub-Jovian

(likely an error). Nonetheless, the possibility of these and
other targets being undetected eclipsing binary blends re-
mains, and requires follow-up RV observations and high-
resolution images to fully resolve.

4. SURVEY COMPLETENESS
4.1. Detectability calculations

To test the completeness of our survey, we injected a
grid of synthetic transits into a representative sample of
light curves. We sorted all light curves from a given cam-
paign by the median noise of the detrended light curve
and took ten light curves at each decile (median noise
for C0-5 respectively: 0.00054, 0.00109, 0.00070, 0.00049,
0.00044, and 0.00046 ppm), as well as the most (∼ 10−6)
and least (0.5−1) noisy curves for each quarter. Into each
of these representative light curves we inserted transits
with radius ratios from 0.0025 to 0.25 and with periods
between 3.5 and 23.5 hours. Each synthetic light curve
was run through our EEBLS detection pipeline, and a
transit was declared detected if it was recovered within

Fig. 7.— Detectability of injected transits by radius ratio and
orbital period. Ten light curves at the highest and lowest noise
levels, and at each intervening decile, were tested for a suite of
injected planets with periods from 3.5-23.5 hours and radius ra-
tios of 0.0025 to 0.25. Sampled grid is shown as small black dots,
while the background contours show that grid interpolated onto an
evenly spaced grid. Black represents no detection, with the color-
bar shading to light to represent the fraction of samples (averaged

G, K, and M dwarfs are also indicated. Note that one candidate,

a radius ratio of Rp/R∗ = 0.1558.

0.1% of the injected period and within a factor of 2 on
depth. The completeness as a function of the input ra-
dius ratio and light curve noise is shown in Figure 6,
while the completeness as a function of period and ra-
dius is shown in Figure 7.

As expected, detectability is a strong function of
the radius ratio. Detectability also varied by quarter,
with C0-C2 less sensitive to small transits than C3-
C5.
In C0-2 only about 10% of light curves would
have been sensitive to a 1-R⊕ planet around a G-star
(radius ratio of 0.01), compared to 30% for K stars
and 50% M-dwarfs. For C3-C5, the detectable frac-
tion of Earthlike planets is roughly 30, 50, and 65%.
We detected 3 sub-Earth-sized candidates (201264302,
201650711, and 211357309) and 6 candidates with 1 ≤
Rp ≤ 1.5 (201606542, 205152172, 206103150, 206298289,
206417197, 210707130), all around stars smaller than the
Sun (Table 2).

By the time the radius ratio reaches 0.035, the detec-
tion probability saturates at 80-85% of all injected tran-
sits, indicating that 15-20% of K2 light curves are un-
likely to detect transits of any size. Unlike in the analysis
of Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014) of the Kepler ﬁeld, we did
not ﬁnd a strong detectability trend with orbital period,

although there is a modestly increased likelihood of ﬁnd-
ing planets closer in.

4.2. Comparison to published occurrence rates

Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014) provided robust estimates
of USP occurrence rate for the Kepler ﬁeld, and we calcu-
lated the estimated number of candidates assuming that
the same occurrence applies to C0-5 K2 targets. For this
purpose, we used the eﬀective temperatures of the K2
target stars as provided by the K2-TESS catalog, and
the occurrence rates and period distribution for USPs
from Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014). We also note that
Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014) found no candidates larger
than ∼ 2 R⊕, so we have separated our candidates into
two bins, using 2.2 R⊕ as the cutoﬀ since that is the ﬁrst
zero-object bin in their Figure 9.

First we estimated the expected number of planets
based on the occurrence rate, which varies by stellar
type. We considered all stars inferred to be dwarf stars
and divided them by stellar type (based on their eﬀective
temperatures) to estimate the total number of USPs in
orbit around all stars of that type. For example, Sanchis-
Ojeda et al. (2014) estimated an occurrence rate among
M-dwarfs of 1.1±0.4%. In C2, there are 1,030 such stars,
leading us to expect between 7 and 15 USPs orbiting M-
dwarfs in that ﬁeld. We generated a hypothetical pop-
ulation of USPs for each ﬁeld and for each stellar type,
with a random number distributed normally about the
mean expected number and with a standard deviation
given by the error bars on the occurrence rates. We as-
signed each hypothetical USP an orbital period between
3 and 24 hours, with a probability distribution given by
that inferred for USPs in Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014). We
selected as many stars of the type under study, drawing
a random eﬀective temperature, and converted that tem-
perature to a stellar radius and mass using the empirical
ﬁts from Boyajian et al. (2012). (This conversion involves
extrapolation slightly above the range of temperatures
considered in that study.) We used the stellar mass and
period hosting each USP to calculate a semi-major axis
and, combined with the stellar radius, a transit probabil-
ity (Barnes 2007). We considered that USP to transit if
a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1
lay below the transit probability. We applied this proce-
dure several times for each ﬁeld and for each stellar type
to achieve robust statistics and estimated uncertainties
as the standard deviation of our resulting yields. This
number is the “Expected” ﬁeld in Table 5, and varies
from 5-14 planets per quarter.

Next we estimated the fraction of targets that our sur-
vey would have detected (using the survey completeness
calculation of Section 4) assuming the same occurrence
rate as in Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014). The occurrence
rate calculations were expressed in terms of planetary ra-
dius and only covered planets from 0.84 ≤ Rp ≤ 2.2 R⊕,
while the survey completeness was in terms of radius ra-
tio and covered a broader range of planetary radii, while
not taking the stellar radius into account. So to recon-
cile the two we ﬁrst found the fraction of planets from
Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014) as a function of planetary
radius between 0.84 ≤ Rp ≤ 2.2 R⊕ (taken from their
Figure 9). We used the same log bins they did, cen-
tered at 0.92, 1.09, 1.3, 1.55, and 1.84 R⊕; all of their
bins from 2.2 R⊕ up were empty. We assumed (as they

P(d)did) that stellar type did not aﬀect the occurrence rate
of planets as a function of planetary radius, although the
detectability of planets would deﬁnitely be impacted by
the stellar radius. To factor that in, we calculated the
radius ratio of each radius bin if the object were around
a nominal F, G, K, or M star (assumed to have radius
values of 1.2, 1, 0.7, and 0.5 R(cid:12), respectively). We then
found a single function for the detectability of a planet
as a function of radius ratio by integrating the complete-
ness grid (Figure 7) over all periods, and taking the mean
over all quarters. Now for each stellar type we had the
detectable fraction of planets in each radius bin (which
ranged from 15% of the 0.92 R⊕ bin around an F dwarf
to 81% of the 1.84 R⊕ bin around an M dwarf). We
then convolved that with the fraction of F, G, K, and M
stars per ﬁeld to get the total fraction of planets from
0.84 ≤ Rp ≤ 2.2 R⊕ around any stellar type that we
would have found, resulting in an integrated detection
rate of 37-42% of objects in that size range depending on
the ﬁeld. This integrated detection rate was multiplied
by the number of candidates in that size range in each
quarter, resulting in the Nest column in Table 5, ranging
from 0-11 objects per quarter.

How do the numbers compare? All of the expected
values are within 3σ of the estimated yields, although we
note that the total number of objects is about half what
we would expect. In particular, three quarters (C1, C2,
and C3) are within 1σ of the expected value, while C0, C4
and C5 are low by 2-3σ (and C0 has no detections). This
raises the question of whether the lower detected num-
bers are intrinsic to (a) this survey, (b) the K2 mission
(less likely without a mechanism for lower yields in par-
ticular quarters), or (c) variability in planet occurrence
rates with galactic location. The campaigns observed
are a diverse sample: C0 is near the Galactic Anti-Center
and C2 is near Galactic Center, while C1 and C3 are near
the North and South Galactic Caps, respectively, and C4
and C5 are near clusters (the Pleiades/Hyades and the
Beehive, respectively). The Kepler ﬁeld, for comparison,
is just oﬀ the galactic ﬁeld in the Cygnus region along
the Orion arm.

We also note that we found 7 candidates larger than
2.2 R⊕, while Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2014) did not ﬁnd any
in the Kepler data (although Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2015)
did ﬁnd one in K2, the disintegrating EPIC 201637175).
Some of those objects are quite likely to be false pos-
itives, and more follow-up observations are needed to
conﬁrm which, if any, are planets. For this reason, we
consider it premature to calculate an occurrence rate for
larger planets. We note, though, that the detectable frac-
tion of such object is high (50-85% around F-M stars) so
this sample is more complete than the lower-radius sub-
group. Thus, the fact that there are only 7 candidates
larger than 2.2 R⊕ (standing in for Nest = 8 − 14 ob-
jects, assuming no false positives and a detection rate
of 50-80%), while there are 12 candidates smaller than
2.2 R⊕ (standing in for Nest = 31) is considered to be
more evidence that the sub-Jovian desert is real.

4.3. Comparison to other surveys

Another test of survey completeness is to compare
our list of detected objects to other surveys that ex-
amined the same data. Some of our candidates from
C0-C3 were reported by Vanderburg et al. (2016), which

was published while this manuscript was being prepared.
Our single C0 candidate was not reported by that work.
In C1, all four of our candidates were reported, along
with four others well below our cutoﬀ signal-to-noise
ratio of 10 (with SNR=5-7) and two that we identify
as EBS (EPIC 201182911 and 201563164).
In C2, we
found one candidate (EPIC 203533312) that was not re-
ported by Vanderburg et al. (2016), while they reported
one target below our SNR cutoﬀ. (That object, EPIC
203518244, had SNR=5.8 and also had a duration longer
than our generous duration cutoﬀ, indicating a potential
non-planetary source of the transit signal.) In C3, we
found no candidates that were not reported by Vander-
burg et al. (2016), and the 3 candidates they report that
we did not ﬁnd all had SNR=6-7, again below our cutoﬀ.
As a test, we reran our C2 search with a lower cutoﬀ of
SNR=5, which resulted in no new planet recoveries but
about twice as many light curves to sort through, indi-
cating that our current cutoﬀ is about as good as the
current data and detection pipeline warrant.

5. DISCUSSION

Known short-period exoplanets (less than 3 days) tend
to divide into two populations: Jupiter-sized objects (10-
15 R⊕), which are known to exist down to just un-
der 1-day periods (the shortest conﬁrmed Hot Jupiter
is WASP-19b, at 0.788 days, Hebb et al. 2010), and
much smaller planets (≤ 2R⊕) that are expected to lack
volatiles. The sub-Jovian desert is the region between
3-11 R⊕ where there are no conﬁrmed planets with peri-
ods of less than 1.5 days, as shown in Figure 8, and very
few with periods less than 3-4 days. The origin of this
bifurcation is an active area of research. Kurokawa &
Nakamoto (2014) suggest that objects with periods be-
low a day represent represent in-migrating hot Jupiters
(at the high end) and stripped remnant cores (at the low
end), while Matsakos & K¨onigl (2016) suggest the bifur-
cation is consistent with short-period planets originating
via circularization of a high-eccentricity orbit.

It has been noted by Rogers (2015) that most planets
with Rp > 1.6 R⊕ are not (entirely) rocky, and must
therefore contain a substantial volatile fraction. We will
note that in general for planets with radius values of 2-
3 R⊕ “volatiles” does not always imply H/He gas. For
example, Kepler-22b (Borucki et al. 2012) has a radius of
2.4 R⊕, with its mass constrained to be below 52.8 M⊕

12

(Kipping et al. 2013), and may be an ocean-like world.
It’s not clear, though, how long such an ocean would
last if Kepler-22b were moved from its current orbital
period of nearly 290 days into the sub-day period regime
of the planets that are the focus of this work. Nor is
it likely that an object with R > 3 R⊕ could achieve
that size without a substantial H/He envelope (Fortney
et al. 2007), which would be vulnerable to tidal stripping
and/or photoevaporation.

Five of our candidates have radius values of > 3 R⊕
(202094740, 201637175, 210605073, 211995325, and
212150006). It is entirely possible that some or perhaps
all are false positives. The dearth of objects in this size
range detected in other surveys makes this group highly
important to pursue via follow-up observations.

We stress that our candidates are still preliminary, and
require accurate followup observations to be certain that
(a) we have the correct stellar parameters, since the plan-
etary parameters scale directly with the stellar radius
value, and (b) that we can rule out false positive scenar-
ios. Towards goal (a) we are continuing eﬀorts to obtain
spectra at McDonald to determine better measurements
of Teﬀ and R∗ (for most objects). For those candidate
that are bright enough, we are also pursuing (b) by ac-
quiring radial velocity and high resolution imaging to
rule out false positive scenarios, and to determine the
fraction of starlight that might be due to nearby stars
(which will aﬀect the measured planet radius).

6. CONCLUSION

We have developed a survey for ultra short-period can-
didates (less than 1 day) in K2 data. In this paper, we
present 19 candidates in C0-5 of K2. Four additional
questionable candidates (three likely eclipsing binaries
and one odd case of vanishing transits) are also noted,
as are 91 eclipsing binary systems. Among the new can-
didates reported are EPIC 203533312, one of the short-
est period planet candidates identiﬁed (P = 4.2 hours),
which by stability arguments must have a density of
at least ρ = 8.9 g/cm3.
Its star, at Kp = 12.5,
is a good candidate for follow-up observations. We
have also identiﬁed four candidates, three of them new

(EPIC 202094740, 211995325, and 212150006), with ra-
dius values in the sub-Jovian desert between 3-11 R⊕
and less than P =1.5 days. An additional candidate Hot
Jupiter (EPIC 210605073) at P =13.6 hours, would be
the shortest-period hot Jupiter identiﬁed, although the
faintness of its host star (Kp = 17.89) makes additional
follow-up diﬃcult. We estimated our survey complete-
ness, which varied from 10-85% depending on planet size,
stellar type, and K2 campaign, with an average detec-
tion eﬃciency of about 40% for Earths and super-Earths
(0.8 ≤ Rp ≤ 2.2 R⊕. Finally, we compared the occur-
rence rate of Earths and super-Earths with Rp ≤ 2.2R⊕
to that of (Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) and ﬁnd that we
detected about half as many planets in K2 as they found
in Kepler (31 vs. 57 after adjusting for completeness).
We note that that survey did not ﬁnd any candidates
with Rp ≥ 2.2R⊕, while we found 7, indicating that (a)
several of our candidates may well be false positives, and
(b) larger planets are indeed rare among ultra-short pe-
riod planets.

All of the data presented in this paper were obtained
from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).
STScI is operated by the Association of Universities
for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract
NAS5-26555. Support for MAST for non-HST data is
provided by the NASA Oﬃce of Space Science via grant
NNX09AF08G and by other grants and contracts. All
the data analyzed in this paper were collected by the K2
mission, funding for which is provided by the NASA Sci-
ence Mission Directorate. This study is based upon work
supported by NASA under Grant No. NNX15AB78G is-
sued through the Astrophysical Data Analysis Program
by Science Mission Directorate. This work has made
use of the K2-TESS Stellar Properties Catalog on the
Filtergraph data portal, through the TESS Science Of-
ﬁce’s target selection working group (architects K. Stas-
sun, J. Pepper, N. De Lee, M. Paegert). The Filtergraph
data portal system is trademarked by Vanderbilt Univer-
sity. This research used Uncertainties: a Python package

Fig. 8.— Known exoplanets with periods under 2 days are taken from exoplanet.eu (queried Jan 2015) and shown as small grey circles.
The 19 planet candidates of this paper are shown in red (some of which were previously reported elsewhere), with 4 problematic objects
shown as open circles. Dashed lines indicate the regions in which few planets have been conﬁrmed: the sub-Jovian desert, between about
3 − 11 R⊕, which has no conﬁrmed planets with P ≤ 1.5 d, and any Hot Jupiters with periods shorter than that of WASP-19b at
P = 0.788 d. The “disintegrating planet” of (Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2015) is shown as a ﬁlled red star just above the sub-Jovian desert line,
while the object with “vanishing transits” (EPIC 211152484, this work) is shown as an open red star well below the line.
