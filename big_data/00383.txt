In zero magnetic ﬁeld, the famous neutron spin resonance in the f-electron superconductor CeCoIn5 is
similar to the recently discovered exciton peak in the non-superconducting CeB6. Magnetic ﬁeld splits
the resonance in CeCoIn5 into two components, indicating that it is a doublet. Here we employ inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) to scrutinize the ﬁeld dependence of spin ﬂuctuations in CeB6. The exciton shows a
markedly different behavior without any ﬁeld splitting. Instead, we observe a second ﬁeld-induced magnon
whose energy increases with ﬁeld. At the ferromagnetic zone center, however, we ﬁnd only a single mode
with a non-monotonic ﬁeld dependence. At low ﬁelds, it is initially suppressed to zero together with the
antiferromagnetic order parameter, but then reappears at higher ﬁelds inside the hidden-order phase, follow-
ing the energy of an electron spin resonance (ESR). This is a unique example of a ferromagnetic resonance
in a heavy-fermion metal seen by both ESR and INS consistently over a broad range of magnetic ﬁelds.

Observation of a neutron spin resonance within a broad
range of materials, in particular high-Tc cuprates [1], iron
pnictides [2, 3], and heavy-fermion superconductors [4–6],
is recognized as an indicator of unconventional supercon-
ductivity. It was shown that sign-changing gap symmetry
can lead to the existence of the resonance behavior [7–10].
Of particular interest are inelastic neutron scattering (INS)
results obtained on CeCoIn5, where a sharp resonance peak
was observed within the superconducting phase [5, 11–13].
At ﬁrst glance similar peaks were found in the antiferromag-
netic (AFM) superconductor UPd2Al3 [14, 15], as well as in
the normal state of the heavy fermion (HF) metal YbRh2Si2
[16], where superconductivity was recently discovered be-
low ∼ 2 mK [17]. Another striking example of a resonant
mode is given by the well known non-superconducting heavy-
fermion antiferromagnet CeB6 [18, 19]. The microscopic
origins of such resonant magnetic excitations persisting in
f-electron systems either with or without superconductivity
may well differ among materials and are still hotly debated.
Application of an external magnetic ﬁeld may help to un-
mask the differences between these various excitations. For
instance, among f-electron compounds, a weak quasielastic
signal gives rise to a ﬁeld-induced ferromagnetic (FM) exci-
tation in CeRu2Si2 [20]. In YbRh2Si2, two incommensurate
excitation branches merge into a commensurate FM reso-
nance whose energy scales linearly with magnetic ﬁeld [16],
whereas in UPd2Al3 the energy gap initially remains almost
constant inside the superconducting phase, but starts follow-
ing a monotonic linear dependence at higher magnetic ﬁelds
[14]. The sharp resonance in CeCoIn5 splits into a Zeeman
doublet [11] rather than theoretically predicted triplet [21],

whereas in Ce1−xLaxB6 magnetic ﬁeld reportedly leads to a
crossover from itinerant to more localized behavior of spin
ﬂuctuations [22]. Thus, application of external magnetic
ﬁeld is an important tool to distinguish different types of
collective spin excitations and to develop microscopic theo-
retical models for the formation of the resonant modes.

Apart from neutron spectroscopy, a complementary way of
probing spin dynamics is the electron spin resonance (ESR).
For a long time it was believed that due to the effect of Kondo
screening, no ESR signal could be observed in Kondo lattices,
as the spin-orbit coupling signiﬁcantly shortens electron spin
relaxation times, leading to a broad and weak signal [23].
This established opinion was impugned when for the ﬁrst
time Yb3+ resonance was observed in a dense Kondo lattice
system [23–25]. Various theoretical explanations proposed
complementary models which explained the existence of
the narrow ESR line [26–28], while further investigation of
different Kondo lattice systems demonstrated that FM corre-
lations are of principal importance for the observation of the
ESR signal [29]. While this empirical result summarized ob-
servations from a limited number of f-electron compounds,
no clear counterexamples are known to date.

Cerium hexaboride is a non-superconducting HF metal
with a simple-cubic crystal structure [30]. Competition be-
tween the Kondo screening and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-
Yosida (RKKY) coupling mechanism via the conduction elec-
trons leads to a rich magnetic-ﬁeld – temperature phase di-
agram. Its ground state below TN = 2.3 K [31] is antifer-
romagnetic with a double-q structure, known as phase III,
(cid:48)
which undergoes a transition to single-q phase III
with the
application of magnetic ﬁeld [32]. Another phase transi-

tion at TQ = 3.2 K [33] corresponds to antiferroquadrupolar
(AFQ) ordering in this compound (phase II), which was ob-
served directly with resonant x-ray scattering [34] as well as
with neutron diffraction in magnetic ﬁeld [32]. As both or-
der parameters are presumably driven by AFM interactions,
the observation of a sharp ESR signal within the AFQ phase
came as a surprise and was then explained with ferromag-
netically interacting localized magnetic moments [35–38].
Only recently, an INS study revealed a strong FM mode in
the magnetic excitation spectrum of CeB6 [19], yet these
observations were done in the zero-ﬁeld AFM state, whereas
ESR measurements could be only performed at elevated
magnetic ﬁelds within the AFQ phase, precluding a direct
comparison. In addition, a sharp resonant mode similar to
that of CeCoIn5 was revealed below TN at the propagation
wave vector of the AFQ phase [18], motivating a theoretical
suggestion that the spin excitation spectrum of CeB6 is domi-
nated by the response of itinerant heavy quasiparticles rather
than localized moments [39, 40]. However, a crossover to
the localized-moment description was suggested for higher
magnetic ﬁelds [22]. Here we follow in detail the magnetic
ﬁeld dependence of spin excitations in CeB6, including both
FM and AFM spin resonances, across the quantum critical
point (QCP) that separates the AFM and AFQ phases with
the application of magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, our present obser-
vations bridge the gap between previous zero-ﬁeld INS and
high-ﬁeld ESR measurements and provide a consistent de-
scription of spin dynamics that is clearly distinct from that
known for other f-electron systems.

INS experiments were performed at the cold-neutron
triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) PANDA at MLZ, Garching,
the disk chopper time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometer IN5 [41]
at ILL, Grenoble, and the cold-neutron chopper spectrometer
(CNCS) [42] at the Spallation Neutron Source, ORNL. A rod-
shaped single crystal of CeB6 with a mass of 4 g was grown by
the ﬂoating-zone method from a 99.6 % isotope-enriched 11B
powder (to minimize neutron absorption), as described else-
where [18]. We ﬁxed the ﬁnal wave vector of the neutrons to
−1 and used a cold Be ﬁlter to avoid higher-
kf = 1.3 or 1.5 Å
order neutron contamination for TAS experiments. TOF mea-
surements were done with the incident neutron wavelength
ﬁxed at 5 Å (3.27 meV) for IN5 and at 5.1 Å (3.15 meV) for
CNCS experiments. The sample environment comprised
a 7.5 T vertical-ﬁeld cryomagnet with a 3He insert, 2.5 T
“orange” cryostat based magnet, and 5 T cryomagnet for
PANDA, IN5, and CNCS experiments, respectively. The ESR
experiments were performed on a cavity spectrometer pro-
viding frequency range of 60–100 GHz and magnetic ﬁeld
up to 7 T (GPI, Moscow). Experiments at higher frequencies
100–360 GHz using a 30 T pulsed magnet were carried out
at Kobe University with a quasioptical setup operating in
reﬂection mode [43]. The magnetic ﬁeld for all experiments
was aligned along the [1¯10] direction of the crystal.

We ﬁrst present the evolution of the FM resonance mea-
sured by TAS in magnetic ﬁelds up to 7 T at T = 0.5 K.

gets initially suppressed and broadens with the application
of external magnetic ﬁeld as long as the system remains in
the AFM state. The observed signal can be described by a

netic ﬁelds within the AFQ phase at an energy that continu-
ously increases with the applied ﬁeld.

To get a more complete picture about the ﬁeld dependence
of magnetic excitations, we also performed TOF measure-
ments on the same sample. A continuous dispersive magnon
band connecting the local intensity maxima at the zone cen-
ter (Γ ) and zone corner (R) was observed at 2.5 and 5 T, and

its intensity distribution along main high-symmetry direc-
tions of reciprocal space is illustrated in Fig. 2. It is remark-
able that the magnon is more intense around the Γ(cid:48)(cid:48)(110)
point than at the equivalent Γ(cid:48)(001) or Γ (000) positions,
suggesting an anomalous non-monotonic behavior of the
dynamic form factor that is characteristic of multipolar mo-
ments (for conventional dipolar moments, it would decrease

monotonically with |Q|) [47–49]. A magnetic ﬁeld of 2.5 T
[Fig. 2(a)] does not change the excitation energy at the zone
twofold, as the dispersion now reaches ∼ 1.4 meV at the M
center signiﬁcantly but increases the magnon bandwidth
point in contrast to 0.7 meV in zero ﬁeld [19]. In addition,
a second ﬁeld-induced low-energy magnetic excitation ap-
pears at the AFQ propagation vector, R ( 1
). At ﬁrst glance,
2
the two modes at the R point, separated by 0.5 meV, are rem-
iniscent of the resonance-peak splitting in CeCoIn5, yet our
discussion hereinafter will demonstrate that the origin of this
splitting is qualitatively distinct. An even higher magnetic
ﬁeld of 5 T [Fig. 2(b)] leads to a nearly twofold increase of
the zone-center spin gap. We also note that the clear local
maximum of intensity at the R point [18, 19] is no longer
seen at this ﬁeld, indicating that the resonant exciton mode
is suppressed and becomes part of the more conventional
magnon spectrum emanating from the zone center.

Evolution of the magnetic excitations at the Γ and R points
as a function of ﬁeld would complement our TAS data and
reveal essential differences in the behavior of the resonances
in comparison with other HF systems. Hence we focused
our attention mainly on the Γ and R points and measured
in detail the ﬁeld dependence across the QCP using the TOF
spectrometer IN5 equipped with a low-background 2.5 T
cryomagnet. Energy-momentum proﬁles for each ﬁeld along
the Γ R direction are shown as an animation in the Sup-
plemental Material [44]. We also present one-dimensional

energy proﬁles obtained from the same data by integration

within ± 0.15 r.l.u. around the Γ and R points as color maps

in Fig. 3. The data in Fig. 3(a) illustrate the nonmonotonic
behavior of the zone-center excitation as it initially softens to
(cid:48)
zero upon entering the phase III
and then reappears within
phase II at an energy that continuously increases with the
applied ﬁeld. A qualitatively different picture is observed
for the resonance peak at the R point in Fig. 3(b). Increas-
ing the ﬁeld within phase III keeps the resonance energy
constant while it decreases in amplitude and broadens, trans-
ferring a signiﬁcant part of its spectral weight to the second
low-energy mode whose tail can be seen above the elastic

line already above ∼ 0.5 T. Upon crossing through the phase

(cid:48)
III–III
transition, the amplitude of the low-energy mode is
maximized, whereas the higher-energy mode shifts up in
energy. Both excitations then follow a linear trend with the
same slope and approximately equal amplitudes in phase II,
in agreement with our earlier report [22]. This behavior is
completely different from the ﬁeld-induced splitting of the
neutron resonance in the SC state of CeCoIn5, where the
second mode emerges from the resonance energy and then
shifts down monotonically with increasing ﬁeld [11].

ESR measurements, which probe zone-center excitations,
have shown that the frequencies of the two observed reso-
nances A and B [37] change linearly with ﬁeld within phase
II, as shown in Fig. 4 with hollow symbols. The linear ﬁts
shown with solid lines, (cid:125)hω = (cid:125)hω0+ gµBB, result in the slope
of 0.098(2) and 0.077(4) meV/T for the resonances A and B
[37], corresponding to g-factors of 1.70(4) and 1.35(7), re-
spectively, as compared to that of 1.90(7) at the R point [22].
In Fig. 4 we compare resonance energies obtained from ESR
(hollow symbols) with the ﬁeld-dependent energy of the
zone-center INS excitation (ﬁlled symbols). We ﬁnd perfect
agreement between the INS data and the resonance A in the

overlap, suggesting that the same FM excitation is probed
in both experiments. This comparison nicely demonstrates
the complementarity of the ESR and INS methods.

In summary, we have investigated magnetic ﬁeld depen-
dencies of collective magnetic excitations at the zone center
(Γ ) and zone corner (R), as well as the ESR signal in CeB6.
Unlike in CeCoIn5, where the AFM resonance splits into a
Zeeman doublet, in CeB6 the second ﬁeld-induced magnon
at the R point exhibits a monotonically increasing ﬁeld de-
pendence. The FM resonance at the Γ point is initially sup-
pressed with the magnetic ﬁeld within the AFM phase, but
reappears upon entering the AFQ phase. Its energy matches
that of the resonance A seen in ESR, whereas the anomalous
dynamic form factor of the zone-center excitation points
towards its multipolar-wave character. This observation is
consistent with the proposed orbital-ordering nature of the
ESR response, resulting from the interplay of AFQ order with
FM correlations [37, 38], and with the multipolar charac-
ter of phase II. The second ESR line observed in high ﬁelds
(mode B) was interpreted as the result of a crossover of the

excited state to the free-ion limit, as the ﬁeld at which it
appears is comparable with the condensation energy of the

AFQ phase, ∼1.75kBTQ [38]. The ﬁeld available in our INS

measurements was so far insufﬁcient to reach this regime,
therefore it still remains an open question if this second
resonance might also appear in the INS spectra above 12 T.
Our current results are a rare example of a simultaneous ob-
servation of the FM resonance by INS and ESR, consistently
over a broad range of magnetic ﬁelds, thus demonstrating
the complementarity of these two spectroscopic probes.

“Magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the neutron spin resonance in CeB6”

neutrons from the monochromator, or accidental Bragg scat-
tering. Sample holders and cryogenic sample equipment are
typically made of aluminum [S1] due to its low absorption
and incoherent scattering cross-section, which helps to min-
imize the background. Contamination from the Al powder
lines that originates from the strongest (111), (200), (220),
and (113) Bragg reﬂections appears at |Q| > 2.69 Å
−1, and
due to the kinematic constraints is therefore not observed
in our data. However, incoherent scattering of the incident
neutron beam on the Al walls of a cryostat or cryomagnet
can signiﬁcantly broaden the elastic line, as it typically ap-
pears in the spectrum as a pair of peaks slightly shifted to
positive and negative energy transfer values with respect to
the elastic position. Their intensities depend strongly on the
thickness of the inner walls of the cryogenic device, the pu-
rity of the used aluminum, and the degree of collimation of
the incident neutron beam. This type of background contam-
ination was observed both in the TAS and TOF data, and we
had to include the corresponding peaks in the ﬁtting model
for the shape of the elastic line to accurately describe our
experimental results. Moreover, in the TOF experimental
geometry, the opposite segments of the cryostat’s inner wall
that are illuminated by the direct neutron beam are seen by
the detector at an increasing angle from each other as one
goes to higher scattering angles. As a result, the apparent
shape of the elastic line also becomes momentum-dependent
after the data are transformed into energy-momentum space.
We can observe this effect in Fig. 2, where thicker Al walls
of the cryomagnet at CNCS in Fig. 2(b) produce more back-
ground and broaden the elastic line signiﬁcantly in compari-

Detailed magnetic ﬁeld dependence

Here in Fig. S1 we present an animation showing the full
set of INS data on CeB6 measured at the cold-neutron TOF
spectrometer IN5 as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. These data
were obtained as two-dimensional cuts along the (H H 1
),
(H H 1− H), and (1 1 L) high-symmetry directions from

± 0.15 r.l.u. along the momentum direction perpendicu-
lar to the plane of the ﬁgure in the (HH L) scattering plane,
and ± 0.04 r.l.u. in the out-of-plane (vertical) direction par-

our four-dimensional TOF dataset by integrating within

allel to the magnet axis. Evolution of both resonant modes
at the zone center (Γ ) and zone corner (R) can be observed.

Comments on cryomagnet background.

The signal in INS experiments can be contaminated by arti-
facts originating from the sample environment, higher-order

He exchange gas background substraction.

Additional background contamination may originate from
the He gas used for heat exchange between the sample and
the cryostat in some types of the cryogenic sample environ-
ment [S1]. It originates from nonmagnetic scattering on free
He nuclei and is both momentum and temperature depen-
dent, which can lead to a misinterpretation of experimental
results [S2, S3]. This type of background contamination was
observed in our TOF data because of the ambient-pressure
He exchange gas in the CNCS cryomagnet. It appears as a
ring of intensity within every constant-energy cut, as can be
seen in Fig. S2(a), where the contamination is observed in

the momentum range 0.25 r.l.u. ≤ |Q| ≤ 0.5 r.l.u. Scattering
from single free nuclei can be analytically described as [S4]:

subtracting the analytical form of the He signal given by
Eq. (S1). The amplitude of this contribution was kept as a
free parameter and adjusted to provide the best ﬁt to the mea-
sured data. For the purpose of this ﬁtting, we have restricted
the TOF dataset to the volume of energy-momentum space
that contained no Bragg reﬂections and no magnetic signal.
The quality of the resulting subtraction is demonstrated by
Fig. S2, where we compare constant-energy cuts through the
5 T dataset, integrated around the energy transfer of 0.5 meV,
before and after the described background-correction proce-
dure. This analysis reveals the FM resonances at the equiva-
lent Γ(cid:48)(cid:48)(110) and Γ(cid:48)(001) points, as expected for this energy.
