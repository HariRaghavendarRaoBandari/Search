DENSITY PROPERTY OF CERTAIN SETS AND THEIR

APPLICATIONS

MANAS R. SAHOO

Abstract. In this paper we show that certain sets are dense in R. We give
some applications. For example, we show an analytical proof that q
n , q is
a prime number and e; are irrational numbers. As another application we
show: If f is an locally integrable function on R − {0} satisfying R px
x f (t)dt and
x f (t)dt are constant with ln p
R qx
a.e.,
where c is constant; which is already considered in [1] for the case when f is
continuous.

ln q is an irrational number; implies f (t) = c

1. Introduction

If f is a continuous function on R − {0} satisfying R px
ln q is an irrational number; implies f (t) = c

It is well known that the set A = {m + nq : m, n ∈ Z} is a dense set in R.
Here we provide a proof using Engel expansion. In [1], the authors proved that a
set of the form {±pmqn : m, n ∈ Z} is dense sub set of R iﬀ ln p
ln q is an irrational
number. We give here a diﬀerent proof. Also the author proved the following fact:
x f (t)dt and R qx
x f (t)dt are
constant with ln p
t , where c is constant. We
extend this result to any integrble function. Another part of this paper is to give
an equivalent characterization of irrational numbers. By using this or the variant
of the proof of this equivalent statements, we show certain type of numbers are
n (q is a prime number) are irrational numbers.

2. Series Representation of Irrational number and density property

For the completeness we give below the proof of Engel expansion.

Theorem 2.1. For any irrational number 0 < q < 1, there exist natural numbers
pi ≥ 2 , i = 1, 2... with pi ≤ pi+1 such that

q =

(2.1)

Proof. Since 0 < q < 1, there exists natural number p1 ≥ 2 such that (p1 − 1)q <
1 < p1q < 2. Now Set α0 = q, p0 = 2 and deﬁne α1 = p1q − 1, then 0 < α1 < 1.
Choose integer p2 such that

Deﬁne α2 = p2α1 − 1. Observe that α1 ≤ α0, which implies p1 ≤ p2.

(p2 − 1)α1 < 1 < p2α1 < 2.

By induction, we construct pn ∈ N and αn satisfying the property

(pn+1 − 1)αn < 1 < pn+1αn < 2,
αn = pnαn−1 − 1 and
pn ≤ pn+1.

(2.2)

Assume we are given pi, 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1 and αi, 1 ≤ i ≤ k; satisfying

(pi+1 − 1)αi < 1 < pi+1αi < 2
αi = piαi−1 − 1 and pi ≥ pi−1

we construct pk+2 and αk+1 as follows: we take αk+1 = pk+1αk − 1. Choose pk+2
such that (pk+2 − 1)αk+1 < 1 < pk+2αk < 2. Clearly αk+1 ≤ αk. This implies
pk+2 ≥ pk+1.

Equation (2.2) yields:

Passing to the limit as n → ∞ equation (2.1) follows.

Theorem 2.2. Deﬁne A = {m + nq : m, n ∈ Z}, q ∈ R. Then the following
statements are equivalent.

1. q is an irrational number.
2. There exist zn ∈ A, n ∈ N such that zn → 0.
3. A is dense in R.

Proof. 1 ⇒ 2: Let q be an irrational number. With out loss of generality we can
assume 0 < q < 1, then by the above theorem,

Also note that for pi < pi+1 holds inﬁnitely often, othewise q is a rational number.

So pn+1 → ∞ as n → ∞. Let sn = −(cid:16)

p1.p2....pi(cid:17)p1.p2....pn, rn = p1.p2....pn,

then rn and sn are integers. Also we have zn = rn + qsn ∈ A tends to zero.

2 ⇒ 3: One can consider zns’ are positive. Let a, b ∈ R and a < b. Since
b, for some integer
(b − a) tends to ∞, there exist N0 such that

3 ⇒ 1: Let A is dense in R, we have to show q is irrational. By contary assume q

(cid:3)

is a rational number of the form q = m0
n0
so distance between two elements of A is atleast 1
n0

. Hence A is not dense.

Corollary 2.3. B = {±pmqn : m, n ∈ Z} is a dense subset of R iﬀ ln p

ln q is an

Proof. Consider the set ¯B = {m ln p + n ln q : m, n ∈ Z}:

{m ln p + n ln q : m, n ∈ Z} = ln q{m

ln p
ln q

+ n : m, n ∈ Z}.

By theorem (2.2), {m ln p
number. Hence ¯B is a dense subset of R.

ln q +n : m, n ∈ Z} is a dense subset of R iﬀ ln p

ln q is an irrational

Now we will show ¯B is dense in R iﬀ B is dense in R. Let y > 0. there exist

sequence mt ln p + nt ln q which converges to ln y as t tends to ∞. Now

|pmtqnt −y| = |exp(mt ln p+nt ln q)−exp(ln y)| = exp(c(t))|[(mt ln p+nt ln q)−ln y]|,

where c(t) is a point lying between (mt ln p+nt ln q) and ln y. Since c(t) is bounded,
pmtqnt converges to y. So {pmqn : m, n ∈ Z} is dense subset of [0, ∞). Hence B is
dense in R. Similarly one can show the converse.

Example 3.2. Any number q of the form (2.1), with pi < pi+1 is an irrational
number. In particular e is an irrational number.

p1.p2....pi(cid:17) → 0. So there

result follows.

Example 3.3. If f is a locally integrable function on R − {0} satisfying R px
and R qx

x f (t)dt
ln q is an irrational number; implies f (t) = c

x f (t)dt are constant with ln p

where c is constant.

Proof. Deﬁne the measure µ on multipicative group R+ as follows: Let E be any

borel measurable set of R+. Deﬁne µ(E) = RE f (y)dy, then our claim is µ is a Haar

measure on R.

a f (y)dy = µ([a, b]. Hense by approximation µ(pE) = µ(E) ⇒ µ(pnE) = µ(E).
Following the same analysis we get, µ(pnqmE) = µ(E). Since the set {pmqn :
m, n ∈ Z} is dense subset of R+. So for any a ∈ R+, µ(aE) = µ(E). This proves µ

t is a Haar measure on the multipicative topological group
R+. Applying [2, Chapter 9, Theorem(11.9)], µ = c¯µ, for some c ∈ R. This in turn
gives f (t) = c1

Note that ¯µ(E) = RE
t on R+.

Similarly considering same Haar measure concept on R+, with f (t) is replaced by
−1 f (t)dt, c1 = −c2.

f (−t), we can discover f (−t) = c2
This completes the proof of the theorem.
