The Goldstone theorem dictates that a spontaneous symmetry breaking entails the emer-

gence of gap(mass)less excitations [1]. In the case where a rotational invariance of a sys-

tem of spin magnetic moments is broken by a collinear antiferromagnetic order, these are

well-known transverse spin waves [2, 3]. The interaction of such Goldstone magnons with

the Higgs [4, 5] amplitude mode of the order parameter is usually discarded, even though

glimpses of Higgs physics have recently been reported in a quantum magnet, a topological

insulator, and ferroelectric and disordered superconductor systems [6–9]. The Goldstone-

Higgs interactions grow in importance near the quantum critical point (QCP), where the

symmetry-breaking order is weak, and its amplitude ﬂuctuations are signiﬁcant. Here we

report an electron spin resonance (ESR) study of a nearly one-dimensional spin−1/2 chain

system, Sr2CuO3, which presents exactly such a case. The ESR spectra at T > TN ,

in the disordered Luttinger-spin-liquid phase with unconﬁned spinons [10], reveal ideal

Heisenberg-chain behavior with only very small, ﬁeld-independent linewidth, ∼ 1/T . In the

ordered state, below TN , we identify antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) modes, which

are well described by pseudo-Goldstone magnons in the model of a collinear biaxial antifer-

romagnet with two gaps, ∆1 ≃ 23.0 GHz and ∆2 ≃ 13.3 GHz. Additionally, we observe a

major resonant response of a special nature, which we attribute to magnon interaction with

the Higgs amplitude (longitudinal) mode in a weakly ordered antiferromagnet. Its unusual

ﬁeld dependence indicates the presence of a quantum phase transition at µ0H ≈ 9.4 T.

The symmetry broken states and quasi-particle excitations in condensed matter explore much

of the same physics as ﬁeld theories of particles in the Universe, while presenting an advantage

of being precisely tunable and accessible in a laboratory-scale experiments. While experimen-

tal studies of Higgs particles or quark conﬁnement in hadrons require giant colliders, such as

LHC, or RHIC, important insights into the underlying physics can be obtained by studying model

material systems [6–12]. Transition metal compounds with weakly interacting spin-1/2 chains

described by Heisenberg exchange Hamiltonian present particularly favorable opportunity for ex-

ploring these concepts. The ground state of an isolated chain is well understood. It is disordered,

with de-conﬁned fractional spin-1/2 excitations (spinons) forming continuum of physically acces-

sible spin-1(2,3,...) states [10–12]. This state, known as Luttinger liquid (LL), is quantum-critical

and even a tiny inter-chain coupling present in a real material leads to 3D magnetic ordering at

T < TN, which is synonymous to conﬁnement [12]. Spontaneous symmetry breaking by magnetic
order imposes linear attractive potential, which at low energy conﬁnes pairs of spin-1/2 spinons

into spin-1 magnons, in accord with the Goldstone theorem. But what is the energy scale where

this occurs, and what is the spectral weight involved – are coherent magnons detectable at all near

the QCP, when the symmetry breaking is weak? What is the role of the amplitude ﬂuctuations

of the order parameter (Higgs mode)? Such mode is predicted by the simple chain-mean-ﬁeld

theory [13, 14], but evidence for its existence obtained in neutron experiments is still controversial

[15–17]. Motivated by these questions, we carried out ESR experiments aimed at a comparative

study of magnetic resonance in the ordered and LL phases of a chain cuprate, Sr2CuO3, at vari-

ous frequencies of the microwave ﬁeld, probing magnetic excitations with energies hν . kBTN .
Surprisingly, not only we have been able to identify Goldstone magnons, modes corresponding to

transverse oscillations of the magnetic order parameter and a hallmark of spinon conﬁnement, but

we have also discovered an unusual excitation with strongly ﬁeld-dependent energy gap (mass).

This mode is not predicted by the low-energy, hydrodynamic theory of spin dynamics, which in-

stead predicts a ﬁeld-independent pseudo Goldstone spin wave [2, 3]. Therefore, the observed

massive mode can only arise from the short-wavelength behavior that is missed by the low-energy

hydrodynamic description, such as the interaction of the Goldstone magnon with the Higgs mode.

Sr2CuO3 is a unique example of a nearly one-dimensional (1D) S = 1/2 chain antiferromag-

net. This compound has a body-centered orthorhombic crystal structure (space group Immm)

composed of chains of corner-sharing CuO4 square plaquettes in the (ab)-plane, running along the

b-axis of the crystal. The strong Cu-O hybridization results in an extremely strong Cu-O-Cu in-

chain superexchange, J ≈ 2800 K, [10, 18, 19]. Small orbital overlaps between the planar CuO4

plaquettes on neighbor chains yield an extremely small inter-chain coupling, J ′/J . 5 · 10−4,

resulting in an almost ideal spin-chain structure. Hence, Sr2CuO3 undergoes a phase transition

into an antiferromagnetically ordered state only below the N´eel temperature TN = 5.5(1) K ≈
2 · 10−3J, in a very close proximity of the 1D Luttinger-liquid quantum-critical state. The in-chain

correlation length at 50 K (≈ 10TN) is already ξ ≈ 30 spins, increasing to ξ & 250 near TN, and
the LL QCP logarithmic corrections are signiﬁcant [20, 21]. Strong quantum ﬂuctuations result in

an average ordered moment of only hµi = 0.06µB, as was determined from neutron scattering and

µSR experiments [22]. Consequently, Sr2CuO3 presents an ideal model material for exploring

effects of an extremely weak symmetry breaking in a system of coupled quantum-critical spin-1/2

chains with fractional spinon excitations, the emergence of Goldstone and Higgs modes resulting

from spinon conﬁnement, and the corresponding dimensional cross-over regimes [5, 13–17].

Typical resonance absorption spectra of Sr2CuO3 recorded at low and high frequencies of the

microwave ﬁeld are presented in Fig. 1. At T > TN , the spectrum consists of an intense principal
line and two weak satellites (marked S1 and S2). An excellent ﬁt to the ﬁeld proﬁle of the ESR

absorption signal for all measurement frequencies is obtained by using Lorentzian proﬁle for the

principal absorption line and Gaussians for the satellites, resulting in three ﬁtting parameters for

4

each resonance line:

the signal amplitude, A, the resonance ﬁeld, Hres, and the half width at
half maximum (HWHM) linewidth, ∆H, shown in Fig. 2. At T > TN all observed resonance
modes have linear frequency-ﬁeld dependence typical of a paramagnet, hν = gµBHres (h is the
Planck constant, µB is the Bohr magneton), with the g-factor values that depend on the direction
of the applied ﬁeld. For the main line, the g-tensor components in the principal crystal axes are,
ga = gb = 2.03 ± 0.02, gc = 2.22 ± 0.02, consistent with the (ab)-plane geometry of the Cu dx2−y2
1 = 2.03 ± 0.02, while the
orbital in Sr2CuO3 [10]. For the satellite peak S1, gb

1 = 2.22 ± 0.02, gc

S2 mode has isotropic g-factor, g2 = 2.11 ± 0.02 [23].

The Gaussian peak shape of the satellite modes indicates inhomogeneous broadening typical

ponents of the S1 mode with those of the principal resonance line (gb

of defects, or impurities, randomly positioned in a crystal. The interrelation of the g-tensor com-
1 = gb) indicates
defects, or inclusions, where Cu dx2−y2 orbitals are rotated by 90◦ around the a-axis. While the
width of the S1 mode, µ0∆H1 ≈ 0.01 T, is small and ﬁeld-independent, that of the S2 mode is

1 = gc, gc

rather substantial and demonstrates approximately linear increase with the increasing magnetic

ﬁeld; the g-factor of the S2 mode is very close to the average of the anisotropic g-factor of the

principal line [23]. This suggests that the S2 absorption line originates from the Cu2+ defects on

interstitial sites whose magnetic dx2−y2 orbital is randomly oriented with respect to the Sr2CuO3
crystal lattice. In the LL phase, at T > TN, the satellite modes S1, S2 vanish with the increasing
temperature in the way known for conventional paramagnets. The integral intensity of these lines,

I ∝ A∆H, which is proportional to the static susceptibility of the corresponding spin degrees

of freedom, roughly follows the Curie law for S1, I1 ∝ χC = N1(gµB)2S(S + 1)/3kBT , and
Curie-Weiss law for S2, I2 ∝ χCW = N2(gµB)2S(S + 1)/3kB(T + Θ), where Θ ≃ 4.7 K. TN
is a Weiss temperature, indicating that S2 spins experience an antiferromagnetic molecular ﬁeld

roughly equal to that of the bulk (N1,2 are the number of corresponding defects, kB is the Boltz-
mann constant). From the ratios of the S1, S2 integral intensities to that of the principal absorption

line, which is proportional to the temperature independent (at T ≪ J) susceptibility of a spin-1/2

chain, I0 ∝ χ0 ≃ 7 · 10−5 emu/mol [19], IS1/I0 ≃ 0.16/T and IS2/I0 ≃ 7.1/(T + Θ), we can esti-
mate the relative concentration of Cu spins contributing to these lines: n1 ≈ 2·10−5, n2 ≈ 1·10−3.

in panels (b), (c) show α + β/T and C/T ﬁts, respectively, for the width of the main line and the intensity

of the residual “paramagnetic” component associated with defects. (d) The decomposition of a typical low-

frequency resonance line in the ordered phase into Lorentzian (AFM1, PM) and Gaussian (S1, S2) spectral

the resonance ﬁeld measured at ν = 27.0 GHz; the intensity of the (0, 0.5, 0.5) magnetic Bragg peak vs

temperature from neutron diffraction is shown for comparison.

Such a small amount of paramagnetic impurities establishes the exceptional quality of our single

crystal samples [23–25].

The temperature evolution of the principal resonance line is shown in Figure 2. At T > TN, this
mode narrows with the increasing temperature, concomitantly increasing in amplitude; its position

does not change except in the vicinity of the ordering transition, at T . 1.5TN. The integral

intensity remains practically constant, in agreement with the low-T susceptibility of a S = 1/2

chain [19–21]. Within the experimental accuracy, the linewidth appears to be independent of

magnetic ﬁeld (the excitation frequency), Fig. 2(b). Its temperature dependence is best described

anisotropy of the weak inter-chain coupling, J ′

as µ0∆H ≃ 0.014 + 0.2/T (solid line). The 1/T contribution can be associated with a small
x,y [26], where our estimate yields δJ ′ ∼
0.5 K, while the constant term accounts for other contributions [23]. According to Refs. [27–29],

z 6= J ′

the absence of a measurable ∼ 1/T 2 contribution to the linewidth, as well as a very small observed

T −dependent line shift, impose stringent upper limit on possible staggered ﬁelds, hst . 2·10−2 K,
consistent with the ideal crystal structure of Sr2CuO3. The estimated T −linear contribution to the

linewidth indicate an upper bound on the anisotropy of the intra-chain exchange, δJ/J . 1.4·10−2

[28], which is further conﬁrmed by the analysis of the AFMR spectra observed below TN [23].

At temperatures below the transition into an ordered state, the resonance spectrum of Sr2CuO3

markedly transforms. We observe a gradual shift of the principal resonance line at all measurement

frequencies, ν, for H k a and c, and in the low-frequency range for H k b, which is consistent

with the opening of a gap in the spin excitations spectrum (upper curves in Fig. 1) [30]. Assuming

the relation for a gapped mode in a 2-sublattice antiferromagnet with weak anisotropy, ν 2 =
∆2(T )+(gµB/h)2 H 2
res, we obtain the temperature dependence of the gap, ∆(T ), which is directly
related to the antiferromagnetic order parameter, ∆ ∝ hSi [31]. The corresponding (∆(T )/ν)2
dependence for H k c and ν = 27.0 GHz is shown in Fig. 2(e), along with the intensity of the

(0, 0.5, 0.5) magnetic Bragg peak measured by neutron diffraction, which also probes the square of

the magnetic order parameter. The excellent agreement between the two measurements conﬁrms

unambiguously that we observe the AFMR, and that magnon modes develop at T < TN in a
system of weakly ordered chains in Sr2CuO3 in the frequency range probed in our experiments.

The ﬁt of the square of the order parameter in the vicinity of the ordering transition reveals linear

temperature dependence consistent with the chain mean ﬁeld (CMF) theory [13], and yields the

N´eel temperature TN = 5.5(1) K in agreement with previous studies [22]. The evolution of
satellite modes S1, S2 below TN supports the conclusion that these signals originate from tiny
amounts of defects and inclusions [23].

For H k b, a step-like, non-resonant feature develops below TN, in addition to the gapped res-
onance modes (Fig. 3, upper and middle panels). The ﬁeld at which this feature arises, µ0Hc ≃
0.47 T, does not depend on temperature and frequency. This allows its identiﬁcation with a spin-

ﬂop transition, where a jump in the real part of magnetic susceptibility leads to a step-like absorp-

principal directions of the applied ﬁeld, H k a, b (top), and H k c (bottom), with respect to the crystal axes.

The two AFMR modes are shown with the open symbols, the solid lines are the theoretical calculations

[2, 3, 32] for the biaxial collinear antiferromagnet. Closed circles show the low-temperature LT mode;

the dashed lines are linear ﬁts to it discussed in the text. The dashed-dotted lines show the paramagnetic

resonance position with the g-factors from high-temperature measurements. The drawing in the lower panel

illustrates a mechanism of dynamical coupling of the Higgs amplitude mode and the transverse Goldstone

magnon corresponding to oscillations of the order parameter in the plane perpendicular to the applied ﬁeld.

magnetic ﬁeld is equivalent to the spectrum of a collinear antiferromagnet with two anisotropy

axes; the presence of inequivalent axes is stipulated by the orthorhombic symmetry of the crystal

structure of Sr2CuO3. The low-energy spin dynamics of such a system is most generally described

9

by a phenomenological theory of spin hydrodynamics [3]. For a collinear antiferromagnet, such as

Sr2CuO3, at T < TN theory predicts two pseudo Goldstone transverse spin wave branches, which
correspond to our AFMR modes 1 and 2. The corresponding analytical expressions were obtained

in many previous studies (see e.g. [32]). The calculations, shown by solid lines in Fig. 4, are in

very good agreement with the experimental data (a small discrepancy for H k b, H & Hc, can be
attributed to slight misalignment of the magnetic ﬁeld [23]). The resonance excitation energies of

both AFMR modes in magnetic ﬁeld are very accurately reproduced using only two parameters,

∆1 = 23.0 GHz and ∆2 = 13.3 GHz, for the gap values rendered by a small anisotropy to the

two Goldstone magnons (lines 1 and 2, respectively). The anisotropy slightly perturbs the ideal

Heisenberg exchange, explicitly breaking its symmetry, and the resulting small gaps (masses)

make magnons pseudo Goldstone, in a way similar to π mesons of the Standard model. The

critical ﬁeld of the spin-ﬂop transition is given by the relation, µ0Hc = h∆2/(gbµB) ≃ 0.47 T (gb
is a b-component of the g-tensor), which is in excellent agreement with the observed value.

Having thus unambiguously established the spinon conﬁnement into the Goldstone magnons,

giving rise to the AFMR in Sr2CuO3 in the energy range covered in our measurements, hν .

kBTN , we now focus on another remarkable discovery. For all directions of the magnetic ﬁeld,
we observe an intense line of resonance absorption, marked “LT (longitudinal-transverse) mode”

in Fig. 3. It has a roughly temperature-independent line width, several times larger than that of

the AFMR modes. This line appears below TN and rapidly grows in intensity on further cooling.
It reveals a novel magnetic excitation emerging in the ordered phase, which is both theoretically

unanticipated and hitherto unobserved. For H k a, b this type of signal consists of a single res-

onance line; for H k b it only appears at H > Hc (see middle panel of Fig. 3). Two additional
signals are observable in the high-ﬁeld range for H k c, whose intensity drops precipitously at

ν . 30 GHz (see data at 27.8 GHz and 31.2 GHz in Fig. 3).

The frequency-magnetic ﬁeld diagram of Fig. 4 shows the experimental data for the ﬁeld de-

pendence of the novel LT mode (closed symbols), along with that of the conventional AFMR lines

1, 2. For H k a, b, the LT mode follows linear dependence, hν = gef f µBH, shown by dashed
lines in the corresponding panels of Fig. 4. The ﬁt yields large and very anisotropic “g−factors”,
ef f = 2.60(5) and gb
ef f = 4.7(1). The triple line observed for H k c has a non-monotone ﬁeld
ga
dependence, and appears to soften in high ﬁelds, possibly indicating a quantum phase transition.

In the vicinity of the transition, µ0Hc2 ≃ 9.44 T, the mode can be described by a critical-type
linear dependence, hν = gc

ef f = 1.91(5) (dashed line in Fig. 4).

10

While complete understanding of the novel LT excitation challenges existing theories, the na-

ture of the spin system in Sr2CuO3 suggests that this mode could be related to the longitudinal,

or the amplitude mode of the order parameter (Higgs mode) in a weakly ordered quasi-1D anti-

ferromagnet. The CMF theory predicts [13, 14] that a longitudinal excitation exists in a system

of weakly coupled chains at high energies, above the spectrum of Goldstone magnons, which is

outside the frequency range of our measurements in Sr2CuO3. This mode embodies the short-

wavelength physics, which is missed by the phenomenological theory of spin hydrodynamics that

describes spin waves, small transverse oscillations of the order parameter, and predicts an unde-

tectable, ﬁeld-independent AFMR modes (horizontal lines in Fig. 4), in addition to the observed

ﬁeld-dependent (pseudo Larmor) lines 1 and 2. An interaction of these Goldstone magnons with

the amplitude (Higgs) mode provides a plausible mechanism by which they can acquire ﬁeld de-

pendent mass. At the origin of this coupling is the spin anisotropy, which favors different size of

the ordered moment depending on its alignment with respect to the easy/hard axis. A cartoon de-

piction of this phenomenon, where the Larmor precession of the ordered magnetic moment around

the applied ﬁeld modulates its length, is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4.

We thus observe a magnetic resonance response in the weakly coupled spin-1/2 chain antiferro-

magnet Sr2CuO3, which shows nearly ideal 1D Heisenberg behavior in the Luttinger-liquid phase,

and transforms on cooling below TN into gapped AFMR modes (transverse pseudo-Goldstone
magnons) intrinsic to a collinear antiferromagnet with weak two-axial anisotropy. Additionally,

we have discovered a novel excitation in the weakly ordered antiferromagnetic phase at T < TN .
It can be understood as a mixed mode of longitudinal and transverse (LT) ﬂuctuations of the or-

der parameter, resulting from the interaction of the Goldstone magnon with the Higgs amplitude

mode. Consistent with this mixed character is its substantial width, reﬂecting the universally

damped Higgs mode, and a large width of the longitudinal mode indicated by other experiments

[15–17]. The observed softening of the novel LT mode at a critical ﬁeld Hc2 might then herald a
symmetry breaking transition to the longitudinal spin density wave state, which is expected in a

system of weakly coupled spin-1/2 chains in a ﬁeld [33]. While challenging the existing theories

with disruptive novel results and ideas, our unexpected ﬁndings present exciting new opportunities

for studying and understanding the interrelation of conﬁnement, spontaneous symmetry breaking,

and the Higgs physics, going well beyond the glimpses of it reported so far [6–9].

Methods

The ESR experiments were carried out on a high-quality single crystal sample of Sr2CuO3 similar

11

to the ones used in our previous studies [10]. The sample was oriented using the tabletop Laue

Xray spectrometer. The magnetic resonance spectra were examined using a set of home made

transmission-type microwave spectrometers with cylindrical and rectangular cavities covering the

frequency range 22−140 GHz. A magnetic ﬁeld of up to 12 T was supplied by the superconducting

magnet. The temperature of the experiment varied from 0.5 K (with the 3He cryostat insert) to

50 K. For the complementary elastic neutron scattering measurements, a larger piece of a similar

Sr2CuO3 crystal was placed in a 4He ﬂow cryostat on SPINS spectrometer at NIST Center for

Neutron Research; the ﬁxed scattered neutron energy of 3.7 meV, BeO ﬁlter after sample, and

beam collimations 37′ − 80′ − 80′ − 240′ from sample to detector were used.

[30] For H k c, in addition to the gapped AFMR mode that develops below TN , a residual signal at the

original paramagnetic position of the principal resonance line is observed at low frequencies. The

decomposition of the typical resonance spectrum recorded at ν = 27.0 GHz and T = 3.6 K into four

components is shown in Fig. 2(d). On cooling below TN , the integral intensity of the “paramagnetic”

component roughly follows the Curie law [closed symbols in Fig. 2(c)], which lets us associate this

signal with a small amount of impurities, ni . 5 · 10−4. These can be either S1 type inclusions, or

in-chain/end-of-chain defects. Their contribution is not discernable at high frequency, ν = 139.3 GHz

(Fig. 2), where we observe only a slight shift of the principal line to lower ﬁelds, consistent with the

opening of the gap, ∆(T ). While the low-frequency resonance line exhibits pronounced anomaly at

T = TN , the high-frequency mode is less sensitive to the transition into an ordered state (Fig. 2).
