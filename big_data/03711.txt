ABSTRACT

Chondrules represent one of the best probes of the physical conditions and

processes acting in the early solar nebula. Proposed chondrule formation models

are assessed based on their ability to match the meteoritic evidence, especially

experimental constraints on their thermal histories. The model most consistent

with chondrule thermal histories is passage through shock waves in the solar neb-

ula. Existing models of heating by shocks generally yield a good ﬁrst-order ap-

proximation to inferred chondrule cooling rates. However, they predict prolonged

heating in the pre-shock region, which would cause volatile loss and isotopic frac-

tionation, which are not observed. These models have typically included particles

of a single (large) size, i.e., chondrule precursors, or at most, large particles ac-

companied by micron-sized grains. The size distribution of solids present during

chondrule formation controls the opacity of the aﬀected region, and signiﬁcantly

aﬀects the thermal histories of chondrules. Micron-sized grains evaporate too

quickly to prevent excessive heating of chondrule precursors. However, isolated

grains in chondrule-forming regions would rapidly coagulate into fractal aggre-

gates. Pre-shock heating by infrared radiation from the shock front would cause

these aggregates to melt and collapse into intermediate-sized (tens of microns)

particles. We show that inclusion of such particles yields chondrule cooling rates

consistent with petrologic and isotopic constraints.

Introduction

Chondrules are submillimeter- to millimeter-sized igneous spherules found in chondritic

meteorites. They formed as free-ﬂoating objects in the solar nebula, prior to their

subsequent incorporation into chondrite parent bodies (Lauretta et al. 2006). The silicate

chondrule precursors, either single particles or aggregates of smaller particles, were “ﬂash

heated” to the melting point and then cooled through the crystallization point. Later,

these objects were incorporated into chondrites through a process apparently involving

aerodynamic sorting (Teitler et al. 2010).

Isotopic dating of chondrules places their

formation over a wide range in time; from contemporaneous with the formation of the

oldest solids, the calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), to as long as 6 Myr after CAIs

(Amelin et al. 2002; Kita et al. 2005; Krot et al. 2005; Russell et al. 2006; Wadhwa et

al. 2007; Connelly et al. 2008; Krot et al. 2008; Amelin et al. 2010; Connelly et al. 2012;

Bollard et al. 2013; Bollard et al. 2014). The formation of most chondrules falls within a

period 2-3 Myr after CAIs (Kurahashi et al. 2008; Villeneuve et al. 2009), comparable to

the lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (3-6 Myr; Haisch et al. 2001; Williams & Cieza 2011).

Because the great majority of chondrules formed at the dawn of the Solar System, they are

ideal probes into the physical conditions and processes acting in the early solar nebula.

Several reviews of chondrules and the chondrule formation process have been presented

(Jones et al. 2000; Connolly et al. 2006; Lauretta et al. 2006; Desch et al. 2012), and

numerous models have been proposed for chondrule formation, with nebular shocks

considered the leading mechanism (e.g. Iida et al. 2001; Ciesla & Hood 2002; Desch

& Connolly 2002; Morris & Desch 2010, Morris et al. 2012). A substantial amount

of information in the meteoritic record serves to constrain the formation mechanism.

Meteoritic constraints on chondrule formation were divided by Desch et al. (2012) into

two broad categories: those pertaining to chondrule thermal histories, and “non-thermal”

– 4 –

constraints. Models are judged by their ability to meet these constraints, especially the

inferred thermal histories of chondrules.

The mechanism found to be most consistent with the constraints is passage of chondrule

precursors through nebular shocks (Desch et al. 2005; Desch et al, 2010; Desch et al. 2012).

Large-scale shocks, such as those driven by gravitational instabilities (e.g., Boss & Durisen

2005; Boley & Durisen 2008), are particularly consistent with the meteoritic constraints,

both non-thermal and thermal, with the exception of excessive heating in the pre-shock

region (Morris & Desch 2010). This pre-heating occurs because a radiation front, known as

a Marshak wave, penetrates into the pre-shock region from the hot, post-shock region, and

is well-described by treating the radiation ﬁeld in the diﬀusion approximation (Mihalas &

Mihalas 1984). The distance the Marshak wave penetrates is determined by how quickly

the infrared radiation can diﬀuse, which is, in turn, determined by the opacity of the

material. Using standard nebular opacity and only one, large precursor size (characteristic

of chondrules) as in Morris & Desch (2010), it is inevitable that chondrule precursors will be

heated for hours before they are overrun by the shock front. If so, they would lose volatiles

like sulfur and sodium, and experience Rayleigh fractionation, which are not observed in

the meteoritic record. Higher opacity in the pre-shock region would halt the Marshak wave

closer to the shock front and eliminate excess pre-heating of chondrule precursors.

Opacity in the pre-shock region is determined by the size and abundance of particles

present. Models to-date have, at most, included micron-sized dust and chondrule precursors

of a single large (300 µm) size (Iida et al. 2001; Ciesla & Hood 2002; Desch & Connolly

2002; Morris & Desch 2010). Higher concentrations of large precursors that survive the

passage of the shock would increase post-shock cooling rates of chondrules to the point

that they no longer meet the meteoritic constraints (Desch & Connolly 2002; Morris

& Desch 2010). Alternatively, micron-sized dust is expected to vaporize too readily to

– 5 –

inhibit the pre-shock heating (Morris & Desch 2010). Here we explore one possibility

that may shorten the duration of pre-shock heating, by proposing that a third population
of intermediate-sized (∼ 10 µm) particles exists in the pre-shock region. Based on our

understanding of dust coagulation in the solar nebula (Sect. 5) we expect micron-sized

grains to form fractal aggregates in the pre-shock region. We assume that once the particles

start to melt, surface tension will pull them into compact spheres, prolonging their lifetimes

against evaporation. Although this assumption is supported by the work of Ebel (2006),

experimental veriﬁcation is warranted. These intermediate-sized particles would add

signiﬁcant opacity to the pre-shock region, reducing the duration of pre-heating. We also

anticipate that these intermediate-sized particles would largely evaporate at or near the

shock front, thereby having little eﬀect on the post-shock cooling rates of chondrules.

In this paper we include intermediate-sized particles in the model of Morris & Desch

(2010), and present our predictions of the eﬀects on chondrule thermal histories. In

comparing our results with the meteoritic record, we conclude that a reasonable abundance

of intermediate-sized particles in the chondrule-forming region will eliminate the otherwise

hours-long pre-shock heating, with little eﬀect on post-shock thermal histories.

2. Constraints on Chondrule Formation

Among the non-thermal constraints on chondrule formation are the following: The

retention and lack of isotopic fractionation of volatiles imply the size of the chondrule-
forming region was (cid:29) 103 km and the density of chondrules exceeded ∼ 10 m−3 (Cuzzi &

Alexander 2006). The observed frequency of compound chondrules likewise argues for a
chondrule-forming region (cid:29) 103 km and chondrule density > 10 m−3 (Desch et al. 2012).
High pressures > 10−3 atm are inferred, to stabilize the silicate melt against too-rapid

evaporation (Ebel & Grossman 2000). The oxygen fugacity in the chondrule-forming region

– 6 –

is thought to have been variable, but was likely more oxidizing than a solar composition

gas (Krot et al. 2000). As outlined above, most chondrules formed 2-3 Myr after CAIs,

spanning an even greater time range. Chondrule formation was not a one-oﬀ event but an

ongoing process, as evidenced by fragments of relict chondrules within later generations of

chondrules (Jones et al. 2000). The chemical complementarity of chondrules and matrix

has been interpreted as meaning that chondrules and matrix dust within a given chondrite

formed in the same region of the solar nebula, with both sampling from a solar-composition

reservoir (Wood 1985; Palme et al. 1993; Klerner & Palme 1999; Hezel & Palme 2008).

However, it is very diﬃcult to determine whether these complementary reservoirs were

produced in the solar nebula or by redistribution on the parent body (Zanda et al. 2009),

and this constraint remains controversial.

The chemistry and textures of chondrules constrain their thermal histories. Peak

temperature is determined by assessing the number of nuclei remaining in the melt and/or

the number of nuclei encountered as external seed nuclei (Lofgren 1982, 1989, 1996; Hewins

& Connolly 1996; Hewins 1997; Connolly et al. 1998; Desch & Connolly 2002; Lauretta et

al. 2006). Cooling rates are constrained by texture, major and minor element abundances,

and bulk chemistry (Connolly & Desch 2004; Connolly et al. 2006; Lauretta et al. 2006).

The majority of chondrules (porphyritic texture; 84% of ordinary chondrite chondrules;

Gooding & Keil 1981), experienced peak temperatures in the range of 1770 - 2120 K for

several seconds to minutes (Lofgren & Lanier 1990; Radomsky & Hewins 1990; Hewins

& Connolly 1996; Lofgren 1996; Hewins 1997; Connolly & Love 1998; Jones et al. 2000;

Connolly & Desch 2004; Hewins et al. 2005; Ciesla 2005; Connolly et al. 2006; Lauretta et

al. 2006). Peak temperatures for barred textures ranged between 1820 - 2370 K (Hewins &

Connolly 1996). According to furnace experiments, porphyritic chondrules cooled at rates
between 10 − 1000 K hr−1 (Hewins et al. 2005), and ∼ 300 − 3000 K hr−1 for barred textures

(see review by Desch et al. 2012). The prevalence of barred textures among compound

– 7 –

chondrules argues for higher cooling rates in regions of high chondrule density (Desch &

Connolly 2002; Desch et al. 2012). Chondrules retain volatile elements, such as Na and

S, indicating that they did not remain above the liquidus for more than minutes, and
cooled quite rapidly ((cid:38) 104 K hr−1) to their liquidus temperature (Yu & Hewins 1998).

The presence of primary S tells us that chondrules formed in an environment with an

ambient temperature < 650 K (Rubin et al. 1999) and did not experience prolonged heating
between ∼ 650 - 1200 K for more than several minutes (Hewins et al. 1996; Connolly &

Love 1998; Jones et al. 2000; Lauretta et al. 2001; Tachibana & Huss 2005; Connolly et al.

2006). Additionally, there is no indication of the isotopic fractionation that would arise

from the free evaporation of alkalis such as Na, which constrains the time spent at high

temperature before melting (Tachibana et al. 2004). Modeling of isotopic fractionation has

demonstrated that chondrules were heated from 1300 to 1600 K in times on the order of

minutes, in order to prevent isotopic fractionation of S (Tachibana & Huss 2005). It is

important to note that such constraints on volatile loss and fractionation may be negated

if the partial pressures of volatiles are high in the chondrule-forming environment, allowing

suppression of evaporation or recondensation. However, in the absence of an environment

that is considerably enriched in volatile or moderately volatile elements (Connolly et al.

2006), the time constraint on “pre-heating” of chondrules must be met.

Interpreting these petrographic and other data about chondrules requires the context

of a physical model for their formation. Numerous models of chondrule formation have been

proposed (see, for example, the review by Desch et al. 2012). As emphasized by Connolly

& Desch (2004) and by Desch et al. (2012), a successful model must make quantitative

predictions about chondrule properties that can be tested against the substantial meteoritic

data. As discussed in Desch et al. (2012), “non-thermal” constraints are somewhat

diagnostic, ruling out some models, but only weakly so. Chondrule formation models such

as melting by lightning, the X-wind model, and shocks due to X-ray ﬂares or accretion,

– 8 –

have diﬃculty meeting one or more of the non-thermal constraints (e.g. size of the region,

chronology, gas density; Desch et al. 2012). In contrast, shocks at the disk midplane, driven

by gravitational instabilities (spiral density waves) in the nebula (Wood 1996, 1996; Desch

& Connolly 2002; Boss & Durisen 2005; Boley & Durisen 2008), or bow shocks in front of

planetary bodies on eccentric orbits (Hood 1998; Weidenschilling et al. 1998; Ciesla et al.

2004; Hood et al. 2005, 2009; Hood & Weidenschilling 2012; Morris et al. 2012; Boley et al.

2013), remain consistent with most non-thermal constraints.

Constraints on the thermal histories of chondrules are more diagnostic and can be used

to deﬁnitively rule out some models. The X-wind model predicts ambient temperatures that
are too high (≈ 900 K), peak temperatures that are too low ((cid:28) 2000 K), and a single, low
cooling rate < 10 K hr−1 for all chondrules at all temperatures below the peak (inconsistent

with barred olivine chondrules), and no correlation of cooling rate with chondrule density

(Desch et al. 2010). The thermal histories of chondrules are not consistent with melting

by nebular lightning, as chondrules are predicted to cool from the peak all the way to
ambient temperatures at rates > 104 K hr−1, again with no correlation of cooling rate

with chondrule density (Desch et al. 2012). Detailed thermal histories have not yet been

computed for chondrules melted in all types of nebular shocks, but in general they would

appear to agree with the meteoritic constraints, especially if gas densities and chondrule

concentrations are as high as implied by the other constraints. Models in which chondrules

form in the bow shocks around planetesimals (radii of a few hundred km) are known to

predict chondrule cooling rates through the crystallization temperature range that are too
high ((cid:29) 103 K hr−1) to yield porphyritic textures (Ciesla et al. 2004). The 2-D model

of Morris et al. (2012) demonstrated that thermal histories of chondrules melted in bow
shocks around large (radius ∼ 3000 km) planetary embryos may be less than 103 K hr−1.

Recent results from the 3-D model of Boley et al. (2013) show that solids melted in bow

shocks driven by large planetary bodies cool at faster rates, due to adiabatic cooling in the

– 9 –

rarefaction wave behind the planetary embryo. Their work shows that solids melted in bow

shocks may not even cool in a monotonic fashion. So although bow shocks around large

protoplanets remain a viable formation mechanism for some textures of chondrules, it is

not clear that they are responsible for the majority (porphyritic; Boley et al. 2013).

3. Chondrule Thermal Histories in Large-Scale Shocks

Large-scale shocks driven by gravitational instabilities remain the most promising

candidate for the formation of the majority of chondrules. These shocks are characterized
by lateral lengthscales (cid:29) 106 km and are therefore largely 1-D in nature. This diﬀerence

in geometry practically eliminates the cooling associated with adiabatic expansion seen

in bow shock models, and also limits the ability of the gas to radiate to a cooler region.

Cooling rates are set instead mainly by the ability of the post-shock gas to radiate parallel

to the gas ﬂow, into the pre-shock gas. Because of these diﬀerences, the thermal histories

of chondrules melted in large-scale shocks are the best match to the meteoritic constraints.

A typical thermal history is shown in Figure 1. The red line represents the thermal

histories suggested by the meteoritic record. The chondrule precursors start at a low

ambient temperature (set to 600 K in order to meet the meteoritic constraints; Rubin et

al. 1999), then heat to their peak temperature in < 0.3 hr, as constrained by the lack of

isotopic fractionation of S (Tachibana & Huss 2005). The melted chondrules cool below
the liquidus temperature of ∼ 1900 K (consistent with liquidus temperatures for chondrule
compositions; Radomsky & Hewins 1990) within minutes, at rates ∼ 103 − 104 K hr−1 (Yu

& Hewins 1998), then take hours to cool through the crystallization temperature range.
Figure 1 depicts cooling rates through the crystallization range ∼ 10 K hr−1, consistent with

porphyritic textures.

– 10 –

The physics behind models of chondrule formation in large-scale shocks predicts

thermal histories very similar to those implied by the meteoritic record. The black curve

in Figure 1 shows the prediction of Morris & Desch (2010), which assumes an ambient gas
with density ρg = 1 × 10−9 g cm−3 and temperature 300 K, a population of micron-sized
dust grains with a mass fraction 1.25 × 10−3 relative to the gas, and a population of
chondrules with radii ac = 300 µm and a mass fraction (3.75 × 10−3)C, where C is the
concentration of chondrules, relative to the solar abundance of condensable elements at that
temperature. In this case, C = 10. Through this system, a shock propagates at a speed
of 8 km s−1. Chondrule precursors start at the temperature of the ambient gas. As the

shock approaches, they are heated by infrared radiation emitted by solids behind the shock.

During this stage, described in more detail below, chondrules are heated nearly to their

peak temperatures. At the shock front, the gas velocity instantaneously changes (within

meters) but the chondrule precursors only change velocity after colliding with their own

mass of gas. Therefore, they reach the gas velocity only after the aerodynamic stopping
time, tstop ∼ (ρsa)/(ρgcg) ∼ 1 minute (here ρs ≈ 3 g cm−3 is the material density of the
chondrules, a = 300 µm their radii, ρg ≈ 6 × 10−9 g cm−3 the post-shock gas density, and
cg ≈ 3 km s−1, the post-shock sound speed). For this short duration, chondrules are not only
heated by thermal exchange with the shocked gas and absorption of infrared radiation, but
also by frictional heating. The frictional heating raises their temperatures by a few ×102

K, to their peak temperatures, but this temperature gain is lost within a time tstop after
passing through the shock, implying cooling rates from the peak ∼ 104 K hr−1. Thereafter,

chondrules are in good thermal equilibrium with the gas, and the gas and chondrules

cool only as fast as they can leave the shock front. This requires them to move several

optical depths downstream. Because smaller particles evaporate in the pre-shock region,

the opacity in the post-shock region is set by chondrules only, naturally explaining why the

cooling rate of chondrules scale with the chondrule density (Desch & Connolly 2002).

– 11 –

Morris & Desch (2010) ﬁnd cooling rates of 10 − 25 K hr−1 through the crystallization
temperature range, for chondrule concentrations C ∼ 10. These cooling rates are consistent
with those needed to produce poprphyritic textures. For C ∼ 102 − 103, the cooling rates

are consistent with barred olivine textures. This may explain why barred textures are much

more common (relative to porphyritic textures) among compound chondrules, which will
preferentially form in regions with high C.

4. Opacity and Evaporation

The agreement between the predicted thermal history shown in Figure 1 and the

thermal histories inferred from meteoritic constraints is quite good, with the exception of

the duration of heating of chondrule precursors in advance of the shock. As is evident

from Figure 1, for typical parameters (e.g., Morris & Desch 2010), this pre-shock heating
stage lasts roughly 10 hours. Precursors are above the solidus temperature (≈ 1400 K) for

approximately 4 hours. That chondrules will be heated before the shock is a robust feature

of these 1-D shock models, and is the inevitable consequence of infrared radiation diﬀusing

into the pre-shock region. The diﬀusion of radiation “upstream”, into the pre-shock region,

is a well understood phenomenon in radiation hydrodynamics called a Marshak wave

(Mihalas & Mihalas 1984). The distance R between the shock front and the edge of this

radiation front is quantiﬁed by comparing the rate of propagation by radiative diﬀusion,
dR/dt = (D/t)1/2/2, with the rate at which cold pre-shock gas is advected into the ﬂow,
dR/dt = Vs, giving (D/t)1/2 = 2Vs. Here D is the radiation diﬀusion coeﬃcient pertinent to
a dusty medium, deﬁned below. From this we see that the radiation front will stop when

t, the time for material to ﬂow from the radiation front to the shock front, is equal to
t ∼ D/4V 2

s . Therefore, the time chondrule precursors spend in the heated pre-shock region

(also t) depends not only on the shock speed, but the radiation diﬀusion coeﬃcient as well.

– 12 –

Fig. 1.— The black curve indicates chondrule thermal histories as predicted by the shock

model of Morris & Desch (2010), as compared to those inferred from experimental constraints

(red curve). The shaded region in the post-shock region indicates the range of inferred cooling

rates (10-1000 K/hr). Chondrules start at an ambient temperature of 300K, but have already
reached ∼ 600K ten hours before reaching the shock front.

The radiation diﬀusion coeﬃcient in a gaseous medium with density ρg, temperature

T , and heat capacity Cg, is

D =

64π2 λ σSBT 4

3(ρgCgT )

,

(1)

where σSB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and λ is the mean free path of photons in

the medium (Spiegel 1972; Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990; Desch & Connolly 2002). The
diﬀusion coeeﬃcient must also account for the speciﬁc heat of solids, Cs = 10−7 erg g−1

K−1, as well as their spatial density, ρd = 10−8 cm−3, giving

– 13 –

D =

64π2λσSBT 3

3(ρgCg + ρdCs)

(2)

This formula takes into account that radiation does more than scatter through the dusty

medium. It is also absorbed, warming the gas and solids, which then reemit the radiation.

The mean free path of the photons is equal to λ = 1/(ρgκ), where κ is the opacity of the

medium.

Combining these results,

D =

64π2 σSBT 3

3(ρgκ) (ρgCg + ρdCs)

.

(3)

Thus D and t (the duration of the pre-shock heating) are inversely proportional to the

square of the density, and also inversely proportional to the opacity. Therefore, higher

opacity will result in a shorter duration of pre-shock heating.

The pre-shock gas density and shock speed have a large bearing on the peak heating

experienced by the chondrules, and are relatively well-constrained. The major uncertainty

in setting the timescale for pre-shock heating is the opacity. If the opacity in the pre-shock

region is attributable to spherical particles with radius a, mass m = (4π/3)ρsa3, and total

spatial density ρd, then the opacity is given by

κ =

(ρd/m) πa2 Qabs

ρg

=

3 (ρd/ρg) Qabs

4 ρsa

,

(4)

where Qabs is the wavelength-averaged absorption eﬃciency, which is well approximated

by 0.8 for wavelengths λ < 2πa, as is the case for radiation inside the Marshak wave. For
micron-sized dust (a = 0.5 µm) made of silicates (ρs = 3.3 g cm−3), with a dust-to-gas mass
ratio 1.25 × 10−3 (as the model shown in Figure 1 assumed), κ = 4.5 cm2 g−1. The opacity
of chondrules (ac = 300 µm) with mass ratio ρc/ρg = 3.75× 10−3 C is κ = 0.2 (C/10) cm2 g−1,
meaning that dust grains dominate the opacity. However, micron-sized dust is predicted

– 14 –

to vaporize when the temperature reaches about 1500 K (Morris & Desch 2010). This is

why the temperature gradient becomes less steep about 4 hours before the ﬂuid encounters

the shock front, as shown in Figure 1. This early evaporation of dust and resulting drop

in opacity (with only large, chondrule-sized particles as the source) is responsible for the

prolonged pre-heating of chondrule precursors.

These features of the 1-D shock are quite robust. Radiation must propagate into the

pre-shock region as a Marshak wave. The time ﬂuid spends in this heated pre-shock region
is t = D/(4V 2
s ). Radiation essentially propagates into the pre-shock region a number of
optical depths τ = ρgκVst ∼ 102. For chondrules to reach peak temperatures ≈ 2000 K
after the shock, the temperature must be ≈ 1800 K before the shock hits, and therefore

micron-sized dust grains must evaporate before the shock (Morris & Desch 2010). The
opacity due to chondrule precursors alone is small enough that t ∝ κ−1 must be at least

several hours. This result is diﬃcult to reconcile with the short (< 30 minutes) pre-shock

heating durations implied by the lack of isotopic fractionation of S (Tachibana & Huss

2005).

Due to the opacity dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, higher opacity in the

pre-shock region would halt the Marshak wave closer to the shock and would reduce the

time particles spend at high temperatures. Increasing the opacity by about a factor of 10

would eliminate the excess pre-heating of chondrule precursors. In current models (e.g.

Morris & Desch 2010), the only sources of opacity in the pre-shock region are dust and the

precursors themselves. Dust will evaporate well before it reaches the shock front, resulting

in a pronounced drop in opacity. Simply increasing the abundance of large chondrule

precursors to the degree necessary to maintain high opacity would assume concentrations

100 times the background dust-to-gas ratio. These precursors would then increase the
opacity in the post-shock region, driving cooling rates to well over 1000 K hr−1; rates that

– 15 –

are inconsistent with chondrule formation. However, based on dust coagulation models (see

Sect. 5), we expect micron-sized dust to form fractal aggregates consisting of thousands of

monomers. If a substantial fraction of such aggregates was in a size range that provided

increased opacity in the pre-shock region by surviving the Marshak wave, yet evaporated

at the shock front, the problems of excess pre-heating or too-rapid cooling rates would be

alleviated.

In order to ﬁnd the optimal particle size range necessary, we use the Hertz-Knudson

equation to determine the temperature-dependent evaporation rate for small and

n(cid:88)

j=1

intermediate-sized particles:

Ji =

(cid:112)2πmijRT

nijγijP sat
ij

,

(5)

in units of mol cm−2 s−1, where i is the isotope or element considered, j is the gas species

containing i, n is the number density of i, γ is the evaporation coeﬃcient of i, P sat is the

saturation vapor pressure for j, m is the molecular weight of j, R is the gas constant, and

T is the temperature. Davis & Richter (2005) give the temperature-dependent evaporation

coeﬃcients for forsterite, and calculate the vacuum evaporation rate as a function of

temperature, as well as the evaporation rate at 1773 K as a function of pressure. We neglect

the temperature dependence of the saturation vapor pressure (a small eﬀect, at most a few
times 10−2 g cm−2 s−1), and substitute the appropriate ratio γ/T into the given evaporation
rate at 1773 K to calculate the evaporation rates at other temperatures. At 10−3 bar, we

ﬁnd a forsterite dust grain with radius a = 0.5µm will evaporate in < 60 s upon reaching a
temperature T ≈ 1500 K. By the time the dust has achieved a temperature of ∼ 1800 K,

it will evaporate in < 10 s. Alternatively, for a particle of radius = 10µm, it will take > 16
minutes to evaporate at ∼ 1500 K and ∼ 3 minutes at ∼ 1800 K.

Our calculations show that particles with radii ∼ 10, 15, 20, and 30 µm, will likely

survive until they reach the shock front, then largely evaporate, consistent with the

– 16 –

results of Miura & Nakamoto (2005). If so, the cooling rates of chondrules through their

crystallization temperature ranges would be unaﬀected and would still be proportional to
chondrule concentration C. However, the opacity in the pre-shock region would be increased

signiﬁcantly.

5. Particle Sizes in the Meteoritic Record

Chondrules from all chondrite groups (except CH/CB/Isheyevo) have mean diameters

of 150 µm to 1 mm (Jones et al. 2000 and references therein; Campbell et al. 2005),

with characteristic mean diameters for individual chondrite classes following a lognormal

size-frequency distribution (Jones et al. 2000; Cuzzi et al. 2010). Friedrich et al. (2015)

and McCain et al. (2015) found broad size distributions, with average particle sizes of >

200 µm and > 175 µm respectively. Microchondrules, deﬁned as having diameters < 40 µm

(Krot & Rubin 1996), have been observed in some instances, including the recent studies of

Friedrich et al. (2015) and McCain et al. (2015). Chondrules in CH chondrites have mean

diameters of 20 µm (Jones et al. 2000). However, chondrules from CH/CB/Isheyevo-type

chondrites are believed to have formed quite diﬀerently from the majority of chondrules

(e.g. Krot et al. 2005), are mainly skeletal and cryptocrystaline in texture, therefore are not

applicable to this study. Microchondrule fragments were found in samples returned from

Comet Wild 2 (Nakamura et al. 2008; Zolensky et al. 2008), and have been observed in

unequilibrated clasts and embedded in the ﬁne-grained rims of “normal-sized” chondrules

(Rubin et al. 1982; Krot & Rubin 1996; Krot et al. 1997; Weisberg & Ebel 2010; Bigolski et

al. 2012; Bigolski et al. 2013; Bigolski et al. 2016). Bigolski et al. (2013; 2016) found that
∼ 60% of all chondrules in NWA 5717 have ﬁne-grained rims, and ∼ 20% of these contained

microchondrules < 20 µm in size (Bigolski et al. 2012). Yet chondrules of such small size

are rarely found in the matrix of chondrites. The highest abundance reported to-date is

– 17 –

∼ 0.08 vol%, found in the ﬁne-grained matrices of two unequilibrated ordinary chondrites

(Dobric˘a & Brearley 2013). Bigolski et al. (2013; 2016) suggest that microchondrules found

in ﬁne-grained rims were formed either by ablation of silicate liquid from the surface of

the host chondrule, or by melting of dust nearby. The spherical morphology and presence

of glassy material lead Dobric˘a & Brearley (2013) to the conclusion that microchondrules

found in low abundance in the matrix of UOCs must have formed as free-ﬂoating objects

in the nebula. Broad size distributions of chondrules would be expected from coagulation

models (see below), but aside from the observation of the odd microchondrule, the

overwhelming majority of solids in the meteoritic record are either large (chondrule-sized)

particles or micron-sized dust. We assume that most particles < 150 µm are lost from the

meteoritic record, either to evaporation or to size-sorting.

Turbulent coagulation models support a fairly broad size distribution, with rapid

coagulation in the 1-100 µm size range, with mm-size aggregates common (Zsom et.

al. 2011; Ormel & Okuzumi 2013; Birnstiel et al. 2014). Thermal coagulation alone

(without turbulence) rapidly produces aggregates up to 500 µm (Figure 2). Most models of

chondrule-forming environments assume that small particles were present as micron-sized

dust grains, but they were unlikely to exist as individual particles. The mean collision
time between grains of diameter d is tcoll ∼ 1/(N d2V), where N is the number of grains
per unit volume and V their mean velocity. In collisions driven by thermal motions,
V ∼ (8kT /πm)1/2, where k is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T the local temperature,

and m the particle mass. For the parameters discussed in Sect. 3, the mass fraction 1.25 x
10−3 relative to gas with density 10−9 g cm−3 gives N of order 1 grain cm−3; d = 10−4 cm
and T =300 K implies tcoll ∼ 1 year. Grains of this size readily stick due to van der Waals
surface forces, forming larger aggregates. Thermally driven coagulation causes hierarchical

cluster-cluster aggregation, yielding fractal aggregates with very low densities that decrease

with increasing size (Dominik & Tielens 1997; Blum & Wurm 2000; Blum et al. 2000).

– 18 –

These extended cobweb-like assemblages have optical properties similar to isolated grains.

Thus, they would still dominate the opacity, which would diminish very slowly due to

coagulation. Thermally driven coagulation proceeds rapidly for the smallest particles,

which have the largest velocities, and slows for larger ones. This yields a characteristic size

distribution with a rather narrow single peak; the size of the peak increases at a rate that

diminishes with time. This thermal size distribution diﬀers from ensembles of particles that

experience destructive collisions, which yield power-law distributions (Mathis et al. 1977;

Weidenschilling 1997).

The presence of fractal grain aggregates has some interesting implications for the

thermal evolution of chondrules in the context of the shock model. Such aggregates

would be heated by the infrared radiation of the approaching shock, before they could be

disrupted by the acceleration at the shock front. As discussed above, isolated micron-sized

grains would evaporate on timescales of seconds. However, heating of a low-density fractal

aggregate to incipient melting would allow it to collapse to a compact object due to surface

tension. Such a droplet would have a lifetime against evaporation of minutes. They would

largely evaporate at the shock front, eﬀectively erasing them from the meteoritic record,

other than the occasional microchondrule. These solids would contribute substantially to

the opacity in the pre-shock region, eliminating the excess pre-heating found in previous

models (Morris & Desch 2010).

In Figure 2 we show size distributions due to thermal coagulation computed for our

nominal parameters starting with micron-sized monomers at t=0. We do not include

the eﬀects of fragmentation due to collisions, which will replenish the micron-sized dust

population. Nor do we include the eﬀects of turbulence. As such, Figure 2 does not

represent the complete size distribution expected to be present in the early solar nebula,

but is intended to be illustrative of the growth and inferred presence of fractal aggregates in

– 19 –

Fig. 2.— Size distributions produced by thermal coagulation, ignoring fragmentation and
turbulence. Nebular conditions are gas density 10−9 g cm−3, T = 300 K. At t = 0, micron-
sized grains are present with mass fraction 1.25 x 10−3 relative to the gas. Size distributions

at 500 years (left) and 5000 years (right) are shown as mass fractions in logarithmic diameter

bins with width 21/3. Aggregates are assumed to have fractal dimension 2.1 (dashed lines).

Also shown are equivalent diameters if fractals are collapsed to compact spheres (solid lines).

the indicated size ranges. We are interested in the earliest history of the solar nebula, when

GI-driven shocks would be expected. At 500 and 5000 years, the fractal aggregates have
peaks at sizes ∼ 40 and 200 µm, respectively. Also shown are the equivalent sizes of compact

spherical droplets that would be produced by melting of these aggregates, with peak sizes at
∼ 15 and 40 µm. The presence of micron-sized grains in suﬃcient concentration to provide

the requisite opacity upstream from the shock wave probably guarantees the presence of

intermediate-sized particles close to the shock itself. These results suggest that thermal

histories of chondrules could be met by shocks recurring in a given location in the nebula
at intervals ∼ 103 - 104 years.

The larger chondrule precursors must have some source (or sources) other than purely

thermal coagulation. This could include coagulation driven by turbulence or diﬀerential drift

– 20 –

motions induced by nebular gas drag (Weidenschilling & Cuzzi 1993), and/or collisional

disruption of larger bodies (pebbles, boulders, or planetesimals). A source involving

collisional disruption would tend to yield a power-law size distribution of fragments, but

micron-sized fragments or grains released by collisions would rapidly coagulate into fractal

aggregates. Thus, the overall size distribution of solids in chondrule-forming regions would

be due to superposition of simultaneous fragmentation and coagulation, consistent with

turbulent coagulation models (Zsom et. al. 2011; Ormel & Okuzumi 2013; Birnstiel et al.

2014)

6. Shock Model

We used the shock code of Morris & Desch (2010) to carry out our calculations of

chondrule thermal histories, with the inclusion of intermediate-sized solids of a=10, 15, 20,

or 30 µm. As in Morris & Desch (2010), it is assumed that averaged over the nebula, the

mass of solids is a fraction 0.005 of the mass of gas, and that 25% of the solids’ mass is in

the form of submicron- to micron-sized dust grains, with the remaining 75% in the form

of large particles (consistent with the proportions in ordinary chondrites). The fraction

of the gas mass that is in large particles is therefore 0.00375 when averaged over the

nebula. We increase the density of large (chondrule-sized) solids overrun by the shock by a
“concentration” factor C relative to this fraction. Here, we assume C = 10, due to settling

of solids toward the nebular midplane (Weidenschilling 1980) or turbulent concentration

(Cuzzi et al. 2008). Consistent with models of the solar nebula (e.g., Desch 2007), we
assume an ambient gas density ρg = 1 × 10−9 cm−3. The speed of the shock is taken to be
8 km s−1. This speed, a fraction of the Keplerian velocity ≈ 20 km s−1 at 2 AU, is consistent

with shocks driven by gravitational instabilities (Boss & Durisen 2005).

In this study, 1/3 of the “large” particles are intermediate in size, with radius a

– 21 –

= 10, 15, 20, or 30 µm, and the remaining 2/3 of the large particles have radius, a =

300µm. The mass fraction of intermediate-sized particles is chosen to be equal in mass

to the micron-sized grains. This improves on the models of Morris & Desch (2010) and

Desch & Connolly (2002), which assumed a simple monodispersion of 300µm precursors

mixed with micron-sized dust. A single, temperature-dependent approximation to the

Planck-averaged opacity is used to calculate opacity due to micron-sized dust grains, as in

Morris & Desch (2010). Opacities for intermediate and large particles are calculated as

in Eqn. 4. Opacities for fractal aggregates are likely strongly enhanced over single grains

(Cuzzi et al. 2014), so our pre-shock opacity is a lower limit. The dust, considered coupled

to the gas, evaporates completely and nearly instantaneously at 1500 K (Morris & Desch

2010). Chondrules and intermediate-sized solids evaporate at identical, energy-limited

rates when their temperatures exceed their liquidus temperature. Vapor evaporated from

the large precursors is added back to the gas. All other parameters remain unchanged

from the shock model of Morris & Desch (2010). The intermediate-sized particles and
chondrule precursors are assumed to be spherical, with material density 3.3 g cm−3. Strictly

speaking, for consistency with the arguments in Section 5, one should start the simulation

with only fractal aggregates of micron-sized grains and chondrule precursors, then add the

intermediate-sized particles when the small grains reach melting temperature. However,

since the opacity is dominated by the micron-sized grains prior to melting, and the mass

in intermediate-sized particles is chosen to be equal to the mass in small grains, our

simulation is a good approximation to the conversion of fractal aggregates to compact,

intermediate-sized particles.

The shock model of Morris & Desch (2010), applicable to large-scale nebular shocks,

assumes a 1-D steady-state ﬂow, conserving mass, energy, and momentum. We summarize

the model below and refer the reader to Morris & Desch (2010) for further details.

– 22 –

Any shock generated in the solar nebula will heat solids in three ways: 1) by thermal

exchange between the hot, dense, post-shock gas, 2) by frictional heating, as the particles

are slowed to the reduced post-shock gas velocity, and 3) by absorption of infrared radiation

emitted by heated particles. Shocks are transient, non-equilibrium structures, so shock

models of chondrule formation must account for the dynamics and energetics of chondrules

and gas separately, and must include interactions between the two. Shock models must also

account for hydrogen dissociation and recombination, as well as the transfer, absorption

and emission of radiation. To minimize the complexity of the problem, Morris & Desch

(2010) considered a 1-D geometry, in which physical conditions were assumed to vary

only with distance x from the shock front, with calculations restricted to a range of x,

the computational domain. Use of the 1-D approximation assumes implicitly that the

lateral extent of the shock front greatly exceeds the computational domain, consistent with

large-scale nebular shocks, such as those driven by gravitational instabilities (GI-driven

shocks).

The shock code of Morris & Desch (2010) assumes separate gas and solid ﬂuids.

The gas is divided into four populations: atomic hydrogen (H), molecular hydrogen (H2),

helium atoms (He), and molecules resulting from the evaporation of solids, which is

represented with SiO. Solids are divided into three types, submicron- to micron-sized dust

grains, intermediate-sized particles of radius a = 10µm, and larger, spherical particles of

radius a = 300µm, representative of chondrule precursors. Dust grains are assumed to be

dynamically and thermally coupled to the gas, sharing its velocity and temperature. We

employ an approximation to the temperature-dependent mean Planck opacity, described

in Morris & Desch (2010), to calculate the opacity due to dust. If at any point the dust

grains exceed 1500 K, they are assumed to be evaporated from that point forward. The

intermediate-sized and chondrule-sized particles are unique in their number density n, their

velocity V , their temperature T , and their radii a, as well as material properties. All ﬂuids

– 23 –

are initialized at the pre-shock computational boundary with speed Vs and temperature

Tpre. The densities, velocities, and temperatures are integrated forward using a fourth-order

Runge-Kutta integration, assuming a steady-state ﬂow and applying the equations of

continuity, a force equation including the drag force between gas and solids, and appropriate

energy equations. The gas can absorb radiation energy (via the dust opacity), can be heated

by interaction with chondrules and and their precursors, as well as the intermediate-sized

particles, and can lose or gain heat energy through dissociations or recombinations of

hydrogen molecules and molecular line radiation of H2O. Chondrules, their precursors, and

intermediate-sized solids, can emit or absorb radiation, or be heated by thermal exchange

with the gas or by frictional heating.

Calculation of the radiation ﬁeld follows the approach outlined in Mihalas (1978),

assuming plane-parallel, temperature-stratiﬁed slab atmospheres. Given the incident

radiation ﬁelds and the source function, S(τ ) at all optical depths, the mean intensity of

radiation, J(τ ) (integrated over wavelength) is given by:

E2(τm − τ ) +

Ipre
2

Ipost

2

E2(τ ) +

S(t)E1 |t − τ| dt,

(6)

where Ipre is the intensity of the radiation in the pre-shock region, Ipost is the intensity

in the post-shock region, τ is the optical depth, and E1 and E2 are the exponential

integrals. During the integrations, the radiation ﬁeld is considered ﬁxed while the gas and

particle dynamics and energetics are calculated as a function of x. It is assumed that

Ipre = σT 4

0 in the pre-shock region, and Ipost = σT 4

post in the post-shock region, where σ

is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant. The calculation of Tpost, the post-shock temperature

far from the shock front, is assumed to eventually cool to the background temperature, as

described in Morris & Desch (2010), but see below for caveats. After all other variables have

been integrated across the entire computational domain, the radiation ﬁeld is recalculated

based on the updated particle densities, radii and temperatures. The particles and gas are

– 24 –

sent through the shock again, their temperatures calculated based on the new radiation

ﬁeld, and the solution is iterated until the radiation ﬁeld and the particle temperatures

are self-consistent. In this respect, the calculation is a so-called Lambda Iteration, which

is known to converge slowly (Mihalas 1978). Indeed, in our typical runs, convergence of

particle temperatures everywhere to within 5 K and convergence in Jr to within 0.2% were

only achieved in several hundred iterations, a number comparable to the optical depths

across the computational domain. A more sophisticated treatment of the radiative transfer

is, however, diﬃcult to implement, and is subject to many feedbacks. We chose to use the

Lambda Iteration method for its ease of implementation, and for its demonstrated stability

and convergence in reasonable computing times (hours).

It is important to note, as pointed out in Morris & Desch (2010) and Stammler &

Dullemond (2014), that large scale nebular shocks are not strictly one dimensional, as

radiation will escape vertically from the disk. Models performed in 1-D will therefore not

properly account for vertical energy losses, thereby enabling precise determination of the

radiation ﬁeld and post-shock temperature. Stammler & Dullemond (2014) included an

energy loss term in their 1-D model in an attempt to account for radiation escaping the top

and bottom of the disk, as well as an iterative approximation of post-shock temperature,

and found Tpost remained constant at a higher temperature than the background, as was

assumed in Morris & Desch (2010). It is clear that a true 2-D model is needed to properly

determine the eﬀects of vertical energy loss.

7. Results and Discussion

In this study, we have improved upon the shock model of Morris & Desch (2010), by

considering a simple size distribution of particles, including micron-sized dust, intermediate-

sized particles of radius a=10, 15, 20 or 30 µm, and larger chondrule precursors. A key result

– 25 –

is that the intermediate-sized solids present in the pre-shock region signiﬁcantly enhance

the opacity over the case where we only consider larger chondrule precursors. However,

they have largely evaporated in the post-shock region, and therefore do not contribute

signiﬁcantly to the opacity, and therefore the cooling rates of chondrules. Cooling rates

through the majority of the crystallization range are raised only slightly over the canonical
case of Morris & Desch (2010), from ∼ 10-25 K/hr to 20-40 K/hr, at most. Cooling rates

from 1800 - 1600 K are somewhat higher, but are still well within the range consistent

with the meteoritic constraints on thermal histories. For intermediate-sized particles of

radius a=15, 20, and 30 µm, the excess heating in the pre-shock region is reduced, but

not eliminated (Table 1). However, for intermediate-sized particles of radius a = 10 µm,

the time spent at T > 1300 K before the shock is reduced to < 30 minutes (Table 1 and

Figure 3), consistent with the constraint on isotopic fractionation of S (Tachibana & Huss

2005). In some cases, the newly-formed chondrules may then move into nearby regions of

the nebula and mix with existing dust and microchondrules, accreting these components as

ﬁne-grained rims.

The nebular shock model of Morris & Desch (2010) met most of the constraints on the

thermal histories of chondrules. However, the model failed to meet the constraint on rapid

heating, required to prevent isotopic fractionation of S (Tachibana & Huss 2005). In the
model, chondrules were heated to temperatures exceeding 1300 K and remained hot for ∼ 4

hours before reaching their peak temperature. Our proof-of-concept study here shows that

the inclusion of intermediate-sized particles of 10 µm in radius, eliminates this pre-heating,

and post-shock cooling rates of chondrules remain consistent with meteoritic constraints.

Our study has provided the insight that a higher opacity of solids will insulate the pre-shock

region, eliminating excess preheating of chondrule precursors. Particles providing this

higher opacity must be large enough to avoid evaporation during the time it takes the shock

to traverse the pre-heated region, yet small enough to evaporate in a time short compared

– 26 –

to the post-shock chondrule cooling times. Future experimental studies will determine the

melting timescale of fractal aggregates, and future theoretical parameter studies will place

limits on size distributions and mass enhancement factors.
