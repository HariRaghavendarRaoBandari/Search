We perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the background of a classical black hole. The
lattice discretized path integral is numerically calculated in the Schwarzschild metric and in its
approximated metric. We study spontaneous symmetry breaking of a real scalar ﬁeld theory. We
observe inhomogeneous symmetry breaking induced by inhomogeneous gravitational ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum Monte Carlo method is the reliable com-
putational scheme broadly used from condensed matter
physics to elementary particles. Although the method is
conventionally formulated in ﬂat spacetimes, it is also ap-
plicable to curved spacetimes [1]. We can study quantum
phenomena in gravitational backgrounds by the quantum
Monte Carlo method.

Black holes are an intriguing environment to explore
the phenomena of symmetry breaking. On the quantum
level, the Hawking temperature of a black hole with ra-
dius R = 2GM [2]

many eﬀects. Our ﬁnding is that symmetry breaking is
strengthened close to the horizon.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we ex-
plain theoretical preliminaries in continuum theory. In
Sec. III, we present the formulation and results of lattice
simulations. Finally, Sec. IV is devoted to the summary.

II. PRELIMINARIES

Let us consider the real scalar ﬁeld theory

can trigger a phase transition provided it is higher from
the critical transition temperature of some ﬁeld theory.
Even when the Hawking temperature is lower than the
critical temperature it has been suggested that symmetry
may be restored near the horizon [3]. This can be impor-
tant for the description of primordial black holes in the
early universe, or micro black holes that could be created
at particle colliders. Symmetry breaking is also interest-
ing in the context of vacuum polarization around com-
pact stars [4] and no-hair theorems [5]. A related ques-
tion concerns symmetry breaking in accelerated frames
[6].

In this work, we perform quantum Monte Carlo sim-
ulation of lattice scalar ﬁeld theory in the presence of a
black hole in thermal equilibrium. The Compton wave-
length of the particle is taken to be much larger than
the black hole Schwarzschild radius. We consider a real
scalar ﬁeld theory with spontaneously broken Z2 sym-
metry. We analyze inhomogeneous symmetry breaking
induced by inhomogeneity of the spacetime. It is known
that the local temperature increases near black holes be-
cause of the Tolman-Ehrenfest eﬀect [7]. This will simply
suppress symmetry breaking [3]. In quantum ﬁeld the-
ory, however, this is only one of the many possible eﬀects.
A complete result is given by the competition among

in a general coordinate ds2 = gµνdxµdxν with the Eu-
clidean signature det g > 0. Although the scalar curva-
ture R aﬀects symmetry breaking, black hole spacetime
has ξR = 0. The Z2 symmetry is spontaneously broken
at low temperatures by tachyonic mass m2 < 0.

We deﬁne a two-point function

G(x, x(cid:48)) = (cid:104)φ(x)φ(x(cid:48))(cid:105).

(3)
When the separation x − x(cid:48) is taken in the direction of
the Killing vector, G(x, x(cid:48)) is a function of |x− x(cid:48)|, which
is denoted by G(|x − x(cid:48)|). (Although it depends on the
coordinates in other directions, its dependence is omitted
for simplicity.)
In the large separation limit, the two-
point function gives the square of the condensate

G(∞) = (cid:104)φ(cid:105)2,

(4)

(the oﬀ-diagonal long-range order) [8]. In this work, we
consider the condensate fraction

C =

G(∞)
G(0)

(cid:104)φ(cid:105)2
(cid:104)φ2(cid:105) ,

=

(5)

as a dimensionless order parameter. The physical inter-
pretation of the condensate fraction becomes especially

transparent in ﬂat space. There it quantiﬁes the ratio of
number of condensed particles versus the total number of
particles. We will use the condensate fraction to quantify
the strength of symmetry breaking in curved spacetimes.
Note that, in quantum ﬁeld theory in curved space-
times, the change of scale comes from classical gravity
and also from ultraviolet cutoﬀ (e. g., the lattice spacing
in lattice regularization). The scale is nontrivially modi-
ﬁed by inhomogeneous renormalization in curved space-
times. Although the condensate fraction is dimension-
less, it cannot eliminate this quantum correction.

III. LATTICE SIMULATION

We performed the conventional Monte Carlo simula-
tion of real scalar ﬁeld theory [9]. The scalar ﬁeld ac-
tion is regularized on the hypercubic lattice, and then
the path integral with the lattice action is numerically
calculated by the Monte Carlo sampling.

Before considering the Schwarzschild coordinate, we

consider the simpliﬁed coordinate

f (r)

dr2 + dy2 + dz2,

(6)

ds2 = f (r)dτ 2 +

f (r) = 1 − R
r

.

This coordinate is derived by approximating the Eu-
clidean Schwarzschild coordinate into the region r (cid:29) y, z,
namely, by neglecting the curvature in the y and z direc-
tions. The lattice action is given by

where ˆµ is the unit vector in µ direction. The geometry
is schematically shown in Fig. 1. There is a (2 + 1)-
dimensional ﬂat event horizon at r = R. From Eq. (1),
R is given by

R =

4πT

Nτ a

.

(8)

To avoid the coordinate singularity at r = R, we intro-
duce the r coordinates of lattice sites as r = [R+ε, R+ε+
(Nr−1)a], where 0 < ε (cid:28) a. We take free boundary con-
ditions in the r direction and periodic boundary condi-
tions in the y, z, and τ directions. We set (ma)2 = −0.2,
λ = 0.2, and V = NrNyNzNτ = 10 × 10 × 10 × 60.

FIG. 1. Geometry of the simpliﬁed coordinate (6).

On this lattice, we numerically calculate the two-point
function in the z direction. As shown in Fig. 2, we see
clear plateaus indicating the oﬀ-diagonal long-range or-
der. We deﬁne the condensate fraction as

C =

G(Nza/2)

G(0)

,

(9)

because Nza/2 is the largest distance. We show the r-
dependence of the condensate fraction in Fig. 3. The
calculation is performed for ε = 0.1a and ε = 0.5a. The
results in both cases agree well with each other. We ﬁnd
that the condensate fraction is enhanced by approaching
the horizon r/R = 1. We can attribute this enhancement
to the gravitational redshift. At the horizon f (r) goes to
zero and the coeﬃcient of (∂τ φ)2 in the action diverges.
As the coeﬃcient of the derivative term becomes larger,
a conﬁguration with nonzero derivative has a large ac-
tion and is thus disfavored. This leads to a disfavoring
of non-condensed conﬁgurations. Consequently, the con-
densate fraction is enhanced. In Fig. 3 we also show the
results in the coordinate (6) without f (r), i. e., in a ﬂat
spacetime. The condensate fraction is ﬁnite and trivially
independent of r in the ﬂat spacetime.

We numerically checked that symmetry is always pre-
served when m2 = 0. This is consistent with the
above explanation. The coeﬃcient of the derivative term
changes the magnitude of the condensate but does not
trigger the tachyonic mass.

Next, we consider the Euclidean Schwarzschild coordi-

nate

[R + ε, R + ε + (Nr − 1)a] and θ = [π/2− Θ/2, π/2 + Θ/2].
We take free boundary conditions in the r and θ direc-
tions and periodic boundary conditions in the ϕ and τ
directions. We set (ma)2 = −0.2, λ = 1, Θ = π/2, and
V = NrNθNϕNτ = 10 × 5 × 16 × 60.

FIG. 4. Geometry of the Schwarzschild coordinate (10).

We calculated the two-point function in the ϕ direc-

tion. The condensate fraction is deﬁned as

C =

G(π)
G(0)

.

(12)

Although physical distance is ﬁnite in the ϕ direction,
condensate is well-deﬁned if non-condensate components
are suﬃciently small. The results are shown in Figs. 5
and 6. The result in the coordinate (10) without f (r),
i. e., in an ordinary spherical coordinate, is shown as
a comparison. The diﬀerence between the condensate
fraction with f (r) and without f (r) increases near the
event horizon. This is essentially the same as in the sim-
pliﬁed case. Unlike the simpliﬁed case, the condensate
fraction strongly depends on r even without f (r). Since
the transformation to a spherical coordinate must not
change physics, this r-dependence is an artifact. This is
due to the strong r-dependence of the overall prefactor

with ∆θ = Θ/(Nθ − 1) and ∆ϕ = 2π/Nϕ. We take the
geometry shown in Fig. 4. There is a (2 + 1)-dimensional
spherical event horizon at r = R. To avoid the coordi-
nate singularity at r = R and sin θ = 0, we take r =

we see the same qualitative behavior. Even at the tree
level, the condensate fraction without f (r) depends on
r. This is because the tree-level ﬂuctuation already pos-
sesses ultraviolet divergence and the result depends on
the regularization to remove it.

simulation result of the condensate fraction C(r). The data

IV. SUMMARY

We performed the ﬁrst quantum Monte Carlo simu-
lation with a black hole. We considered a real scalar
ﬁeld theory with spontaneously broken Z2 symmetry. We
found that spontaneous symmetry breaking is strength-
ened by redshift near black holes. Unfortunately, the
calculation in the Schwarzschild coordinates (essentially
in the spherical coordinates) suﬀers from the artiﬁcial r-
dependence of the regularization. It is intuitively sugges-
tive that the physical eﬀect would be the diﬀerence of the
condensate fraction with and without the redshift factor
f (r). This is clearly supported by the calculation in the
simpliﬁed coordinate. However, for the practical use of
the Schwarzschild coordinate, we need to solve the prob-
lem of the artiﬁcial r-dependence. Actually, this is not a
speciﬁc problem of lattice theory but a general problem of
quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetimes. The theoreti-
cal calculation of quantum ﬁeld theory has ﬁnite ambigu-
ity stemming from regularization. The ambiguity can be
artiﬁcially inhomogeneous in curved spacetimes. Physi-
cal inhomogeneity is hidden by such ambiguity. Although
it can be partially corrected by perturbative renormaliza-
tion, the complete correction by nonperturbative renor-
malization is extremely diﬃcult.

The application to chiral symmetry breaking in QCD
is an interesting future work. Although chiral symmetry
is spontaneously broken in our present universe, it can be
changed locally by black holes. Not only redshift but also

det g = r2 sin θ. This prefactor changes the unit cell
a4 in the Cartesian coordinate to a2∆θ∆ϕr2 sin θ in a
spherical coordinate. This change leads to the artiﬁcial
r-dependence of physical parameters via renormalization.
Moreover, as seen in Fig. 6, ε-independence is lost near
the event horizon.

Finally, we compare the simulation with other calcu-
lations in Fig. 7. The classical condensate fraction is

unity because the classical solution φc =(cid:112)−m2/λ is ho-

mogeneous and thus the two-point function is constant.
The tree-level result is the sum of the classical solution
and the tree-level ﬂuctuation around it. For the detail,
see Appendix. The tree-level calculation is done with
the same lattice action, parameters, and boundary con-
ditions as the full simulation. While the tree-level cal-
culation and the full result are quantitatively diﬀerent,

fermions [10]. We can study the saga of chiral symmetry
around black holes by evaluating the competition among
them correctly in lattice QCD.
