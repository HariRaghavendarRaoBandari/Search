Implications of imaginary chemical potential for model building of QCD

Properties of QCD at ﬁnite imaginary chemical potential are revisited to utilize for the model
building of QCD in low energy regimes. For example, the electric holonomy which is closely related to
the Polyakov-loop drastically aﬀects thermodynamic quantities beside the Roberge-Weiss transition
line. To incorporate several properties at ﬁnite imaginary chemical potential, it is important to
introduce the holonomy eﬀects to the coupling constant of eﬀective models. This extension is
possible by considering the entanglement vertex. We show justiﬁcations of the entanglement vertex
based on the derivation of the eﬀective four-fermi interaction in the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model and
present its general form with the local approximation. To discuss how to remove model ambiguities
in the entanglement vertex, we calculate the chiral condensate with diﬀerent Z3 sectors and the dual
quark condensate.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding non-perturbative properties of Quan-
tum Chromodynamics (QCD) is one of the important
and interesting subjects in nuclear and elementary par-
ticle physics. The lattice QCD simulation is a promising
method to understand such non-perturbative properties,
but the sign problem obscures it at ﬁnite real chemical
potential (µR). Therefore, low energy eﬀective models
of QCD are widely used to investigate the QCD phase
structure at ﬁnite µR.

In the modeling of QCD in low energy regimes, the
chiral condensate and the Polyakov-loop play an im-
portant role to describe the chiral and conﬁnement-
deconﬁnement transitions. The famous eﬀective model
is
the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu–Jona-Lasinio
(PNJL) model [1]. In the PNJL model, the quark and
gluon contributions are taken into account through the
one-loop level eﬀective potential in usual. There is the
uncertainty how to introduce the gauge boson contribu-
tion. Usually, the chiral part is described by using the
Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model or similar quark mod-
els in eﬀective models. However, the gluon part is less
clear than the quark part. There are several eﬀective
models for the gluon contribution; for example, the log-
arithmic potential based on the strong coupling expan-
sion [1, 2], the Ginzburg-Landau type potential [3, 4], the
Meisinger-Miller-Ogilvie model [5], the matrix model for
the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition [6, 7], the ef-
fective potential from the Landau-gauge gluon and ghost
propagators [8], the holonomy potential [9] and so on.

In addition to individual parts of the quark and gluon
contributions, it is important how to control the strength
of the correlation between the quark and gluon contri-
butions in eﬀective models.
Importance of such corre-
lation can be clearly seen in the lattice QCD data at
ﬁnite temperature (T ) and the imaginary chemical po-

tential (µI) [10, 11]. At ﬁnite µI, there is the ﬁrst-order
transition line which is so called the Roberg-Weiss (RW)
transition and its endpoint which is so called the RW
endpoint [12]. In Ref. [10, 11], the pion mass (mπ) de-
pendence of the RW endpoint has been predicted by the
lattice QCD simulation. At suﬃciently large mπ, the or-
der of the RW endpoint is the ﬁrst-order which is induced
by the ﬁrst-order Z3 transition. The ﬁrst-order RW end-
point becomes the crossover by the explicit breaking of
the Z3 symmetry at moderate mπ. However, there is the
mysterious behavior of the RW endpoint at small mπ;
the order of the transition turns into the ﬁrst-order! This
behavior cannot be reproduced by using simple eﬀective
model of QCD, but it can be possible by considering the
extension of the coupling constant.

Recently, it has been proposed in Ref. [13, 14] that the
conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition can be described
by using the analogy of the topological order [15] moti-
vated by the recent progress done in Ref. [16] at T = 0
QCD. In the conjecture [13, 14], the nontrivial free-
energy degeneracy at ﬁnite µI plays a crucial role. The
non-trivial degeneracy is related with the drastic change
of the holonomy beside θ = (2k − 1)k/Nc in the decon-
ﬁnement phase where θ is the dimensionless chemical po-
tential θ ≡ µI/T , Nc means the number of color and k
is any integer. Then, we can deﬁne the quantum order-
parameter which is so called the quark number holon-
omy on the manifold in all possible boundary condition
space which is equivalence to the θ space because the
boundary condition and the imaginary chemical poten-
tial have direct relation, see Ref. [12, 17] as an example.
From these viewpoints, holonomy eﬀects in the eﬀective
model is crucial not only incorporating the conﬁnement-
deconﬁnement transition into the model, but also under-
standing the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition itself.
In this paper, we revisit the imaginary chemical po-
tential region to obtain some constraints for the model
building of QCD in the low energy regime. This paper is
organized as follows. In the next section, we summarize
the RW transition and some related topics on it at ﬁ-
nite µI. Section III explains the extension of the eﬀective

model based on Ref. [18]. Then, we show justiﬁcations
of the extension based on the derivation of the eﬀective
four-fermi interaction. In Sec. IV, we calculate the chi-
ral condensate with diﬀerent Z3 sectors to discuss how
to remove ambiguities of model parameters. Section V is
devoted to summary.

II.

IMAGINARY CHEMICAL POTENTIAL

It is well known that there is a special periodicity in

the QCD partition function (Z) as a function of θ;

Z(θ) = Z(cid:16)θ +

2πk

Nc (cid:17).

(1)

This means that several quantities have the 2π/Nc peri-
odicity. This periodicity is so called the Roberge-Weiss
(RW) periodicity.

In the low and high T region, origins of the RW peri-
odicity is quite diﬀerent. At low T , the RW periodicity
is realized by only one global minimum on the complex
Polyakov-loop (Φ) plane, but does not at high T . The
ZNc images should be needed to realize the RW period-
icity at high T ; for example, the Z3 images are ei2π/3
and ei4π/3 for Φ = 1. This diﬀerence of origins seems to
be related with the conﬁnement and the deconﬁnement
nature. From the diﬀerent realization of the RW period-
icity at low and high T , there should be the ﬁrst-order
transition and its endpoint at θ = (2k − 1)π/Nc. Those
are called the RW transition and the RW endpoint, re-
spectively.

When we change θ with ﬁxing T in the conﬁned phase,
the phase of the Polyakov-loop φ which is determined
from

Φ =

Nc

A4(τ, ~x) dτ(cid:17)i = |Φ| eiφ,

(2)

is continuously rotated as the soliton solution which may
be described by the Jacobi elliptic function where P
means the path ordering operator, g is the gauge coupling
constant and β means the inverse temperature (1/T ).
On the other hand, the Polyakov-loop phase is discon-
tinuously rotated in the deconﬁned phase. The discon-
tinuous point appears when we across the RW transition
line. The electric holonomy (ν) is then discontinuously
changed beside the RW transition line and then we ob-
tain

and pressure should have the cusp, but θ-odd quanti-
ties such as the quark number density have the gap at
θ = (2k − 1)π/Nc above the RW endpoint.

The RW transition and endpoint have interesting phe-
nomena as discussed above, but it may have more mys-
terious behavior which is the triple-point realization of
the RW endpoint at small mπ which is predicted by the
lattice QCD simulation [10, 11]. At suﬃciently large mπ,
the order of the RW endpoint is the ﬁrst-order. This ﬁrst-
order RW endpoint becomes the crossover by the explicit
breaking of the Z3 symmetry when we set mπ as moder-
ate values. However, the order of the RW transition turns
into the ﬁrst-order again at small mπ. This behavior is
considered as the consequence of the correlation between
the chiral and the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition
nature, but it is still under debate. By using simple eﬀec-
tive models such as the standard PNJL model, this be-
havior cannot be reproduced; for example, see Ref. [19].
To resolve this point, we need extension of the eﬀective
model. Actually, by extending the coupling constant in
the PNJL model, we can reproduce the lattice QCD sim-
ulation [18], but the exact form of the extended coupling
constant is not discussed so far. In the next section, we
revisit this point.

III. ENTANGLEMENT VERTEX

In this study, we use the PNJL model. The simplest
two-ﬂavor and three-color PNJL model Lagrangian den-
sity becomes

L = ¯q(i /D − m0)q + G[(¯qq)2 + (¯qiγ5~τ q)2] − βV U,

(3)

0 Aν,aλa/2 with Gell-Man matrices
where Dµ = ∂µ + iδν
λa, m0 expresses the current quark mass, G is the cou-
pling constant and V does the three-dimensional volume.
The term U expresses the gluon contribution. Model pa-
rameters in the NJL part such as m0, G and the cutoﬀ
of the three-dimensional momentum integration (Λ) is
determined by using the mπ and pion decay constant.
The actual values used in this study are m0 = 5.5 MeV,
G = 5.498 GeV−2, Λ = 613.5 MeV.

In this study, we use the mean-ﬁeld approximation;
see Ref. [18] for the details of the calculation. The ac-
tual thermodynamic potential can be obtained from the
Lagrangian density (3) as

Ω = −4Z

where we deﬁne dν as {dν | 0 ≤ dν ≤ 2π}. Just on the
RW endpoint, dν depends on its order: If the RW end-
point is ﬁrst-order, dν should be 2π/Nc. Because of this
behavior, θ-even quantities such as the entropy density

f − = 1 + 3(Φ + ¯Φe−βE−(p))e−βE−(p) + e−3βE−(p),
f + = 1 + 3( ¯Φ + Φe−βE+(p))e−βE+(p) + e−3βE+(p),

here ¯Φ is the conjugate of Φ and E∓(p) = E(p) ∓ µ =

pp2 + M 2 ∓ µ with M = m0 − 2Gσ and the chemical po-

tential µ = (µR, µI). The quantity σ becomes the chiral
condensate in the present model. The gluon contribution
U is taken into account via the logarithmic Polyakov-loop
eﬀective potential [2] as

range. The gluon follows the adjoint representation of
SU (Nc), and thus the entanglement vertex should obey
the adjoint representation nature.

To introduce the adjoint representation nature to the
entanglement vertex, we refer to the structure of the
gluon one-loop eﬀective potential and the Bose distribu-
tion function with the electric holonomy. Those manifest
the Z3 symmetric form and other adjoint representation
natures. So, more general form of the entanglement ver-
tex for the color singlet sector can be written as

with a0 = 3.51, a1 = −2.56, a2 = 15.2, a3 = −0.62 and
b4 = −1.68. These parameters are determined to repro-
duce the lattice QCD data such as the energy and the
entropy density in the pure gauge limit. The parameter
T0 controls the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement temperature
(TD) in the pure gauge limit and thus we set T0 = 270
MeV because we are interested in the quenched calcula-
tion.

In Ref. [18], the extension of the PNJL model coupling
constant has been proposed. The extension has been
done by the replacement

G → G(Φ) = G[1 − α1 ¯ΦΦ − α2( ¯Φ3 + Φ3)],

(8)

where α1 and α2 are new parameters. This extended
coupling constant is so called the entanglement vertex.
In the extension, the Z3 symmetry of the vertex is as-
sumed. This interaction strongly correlates the chiral
and the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition. The en-
tanglement nature is deeply related with the nonlocal
properties of the interaction which is usually hidden in
the local PNJL model.

From the derivation of the NJL and also the PNJL
model, the nonlocal nature is a natural consequence. The
PNJL model can be obtained starting from QCD parti-
tion function by using the color-current expansion and
some ansatz for gluon properties; details of the nonlocal
PNJL model, for example, see Ref. [20–22] and references
therein. The nonlocal interaction should feel eﬀects com-
ing from the gluon two-point function since the interac-
tion forms

two-point function without quark loops because we use
the color-current expansion around j = 0. Since the two-
point function does not have quark loops, W (2) should be
ZNc symmetric form. To obtain the local version of the
PNJL model, we should replace the two-point function
as the delta function since we assume W (2) is very short

C1 = C7 = 1 − 9 ¯ΦΦ,
C2 = C6 = 1 − 27 ¯ΦΦ + 27( ¯Φ3 + Φ3),
C3 = C5 = −2 + 27 ¯ΦΦ − 81( ¯ΦΦ)2,
C4 = 2h−1 + 9 ¯ΦΦ − 27( ¯Φ3 + Φ3) + 81( ¯ΦΦ)2i,

C8 = 1.

(11)

For details of functions Cn, see Ref. [23]. Even if we
assume the eﬀective gluon mass such as the Gribov-Stingl
form at ﬁnite T as

D(T,L)

T

∝

dt,l(p2 + d−1
t,l )
t,l)2 ,
(p2 + r2

(12)

we then obtain same expression of Cn [8], where DT
T (DL
T )
are the tree-dimensional transverse (longitudinal) gluon
propagator. Thus, we can expect that above expression
is general form for the entanglement vertex.

When we assume that the W (2) is short range, higher-
order terms of e−βE in Eq. (10) should be suppressed and
then only C1 is relevant. From here, we set γ = 1 to make
our discussion simple and it is not an essential point in
the level of present discussions. Thus, we can eﬀectively
rewrite the coupling constant (10) as the simple form

G(Φ) ∼ GN(cid:16)1 + α ¯ΦΦ(cid:17),

(13)

where GN is corresponding to G in the original PNJL
model in this case because ¯Φ and Φ do not aﬀect the
physics at T = 0. This form is similar to Eq. (8), but
it is more general. If we set α = −α1 and α2 = 0 with
γ = 1, this vertex is perfectly matched with the ver-
tex (8). From present representation, terms proportional
to ( ¯Φ3 + Φ3) becomes the higher-order contribution and
thus it can be safely neglected in the level discussed here.
In the eﬀective model construction, important operation
is the parameter ﬁxing. Details of parameter ﬁxing are
discussed in the next section.

Recently, it has been numerically shown that the Z3

4 − Ab

4 = Aa

factor can aﬀect the Landau-gauge gluon propagator in
the deconﬁned phase by using the pure gauge calcula-
tion in Ref. [24]. In the gluon propagator, the Z3 factors
can appear via Aab
4 when we consider the
background gauge ﬁeld where A4 is the temporal compo-
nent of the ﬁeld and a, b run 1, · · · , Nc because the gluon
obeys the adjoint representation. For a = b diagonal sec-
tors, the ZNc factor cannot appear because of the exact
cancellation of the Z3 factors. On the other hand, the
non-diagonal a 6= b sectors may feel the eﬀect via the ef-
fective gluon mass. Also, in the conﬁned and deconﬁned
phases, the elementary degree of freedom is drastically
diﬀerent; it is glueball in the conﬁned phase, but it is
gluon in the deconﬁned phase. Both reasons may lead
to the lattice QCD predicted phenomena, but we need
more careful investigation for the lattice QCD data to
conclude it. In the short range limit of W (2), the color
structure is extremely simpliﬁed and thus above eﬀect
cannot appears in the local PNJL model. To incorpo-
rate the eﬀects, we should consider the nonlocal PNJL
model, but it seems a diﬃcult task. Even in the modern
nonlocal PNJL model [2, 22, 25–28], we implicitly use
the simpliﬁcation of the color structure of the four-fermi
interaction. At present, we do not know how important
this eﬀects for the gauge invariant observable, and thus
we assume that W (2) is short range to neglect the eﬀect
as a ﬁrst step. This problem will be discussed in the
nonlocal PNJL model in elsewhere.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we discuss how to remove ambiguities
of the parameters in the entanglement vertex by using
lattice QCD simulations with the quenched approxima-
tion. The entanglement vertex correlates the chiral and
the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition and thus the
chiral condensate with diﬀerent Z3 sectors seems to be a
promising quantity to remove ambiguities of model pa-
rameters. The existence of non-trivial Z3 sectors which is
characterized by φ = 2π
3 is not trivial in the sys-
tem with dynamical quarks. Therefore, we here consider
the quenched approximation since all possible Z3 sectors
are well deﬁned. The calculation of the chiral conden-
sate with the diﬀerent Z3 sector was done in Ref. [29, 30]
and thus we follow their calculation by using present ex-
tended model. In the calculation [30] , they introduce the
T -dependent coupling constant by hand, but this eﬀect
is automatically introduced in the present entanglement
PNJL model.

3 and 4π

In this study, we ﬁrst calculate Φ in the pure
gauge limit to consider the quenched calculation. The
Polyakov-loop with non-trivial Z3 sectors, Φ 2π
and
Φ 4π
, are obtained by the Z3 transformation from the
Polyakov-loop with the trivial Z3 sector, Φ0. Figure 1
shows Φ with φ = 0 and φ = 2π
3 in the pure gauge limit
as a function of T . After this calculation, we substitute
those Φ to the PNJL model and then we minimize the

dure is corresponding to the quenched calculation of the
PNJL model.

Figure. 2 shows the chiral condensate with diﬀerent
Z3 sectors at µ = 0 as a function of T . The top and
bottom panels of Fig. 2 show σ/σ0 with the trivial Z3
sector φ = 0 and that with φ = 2π/3 where σ0 is σ at
T = µ = 0, respectively. It is natural to assume that the
entanglement vertex is decreased with increasing T and
thus the sign of α is negative because of properties of the
running coupling in QCD. When α is small in the bottom
panel, the chiral condensate increases above TD, but it
decreases in the large-α case. There is the drastic change
in the T -dependence of σ and thus we can determine the
parameters in the entanglement vertex by using precise
quenched lattice QCD data. At least in Ref. [29, 30], the
chiral condensate with nontrivial Z3 sectors are decreased
and thus α should be considerably large. To conclude the
detailed value of α, we need more precise quenched lattice
QCD data.

Other promising quantity to remove the model ambi-
guities is the dual quark condensate [31–33]. The dual
quark condensate is the order-parameter of the ZNc sym-
metry breaking as same as the Polyakov-loop. This quan-
tity has been calculated by using the lattice QCD sim-
ulation [31–33], the Schwinger-Dyson equations [34], the
eﬀective model of QCD [35], the functional renormaliza-
tion group equations [36] and so on. The dual quark
condensate is deﬁned as

for the temporal direction and σ is the ϕ-dependent chi-

condition and the imaginary chemical potential have di-
rect relation, θ = ϕ − π. In the system with dynamical
quarks, there are some problems in the dual quark con-
densate [37–39], but we can expect that the quenched cal-
culations where the dual quark condensate is well deﬁned
can provide the important information for the eﬀective
model construction. At present, quenched lattice QCD
data for the dual quark condensate are limited and thus
we do not quantitatively compare our results with the

σ . At least in quenched lattice QCD
data we can access [31], Σ(1)
increases with increasing T
σ
and thus extremely strong α may be excluded, but we
need more quenched lattice QCD data to conclude it.
The critical value (αc) which leads to the ﬂat behavior
of Σ(1)
σ above TD exists in the range −0.7 < αc < −0.6.

Finally, we propose a new quantity which can describe
the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition based on the
dual quark condensate. The quantity is deﬁned as

O = Z dϕ
Σ(n)

2π

e−inϕO(ϕ),

(15)

where O is the θ-even quantity. If we consider that the
dual quark condensate measures how information of Z3
images are missed in the calculation of Eq. (14) when
the gauge conﬁguration is ﬁxed to the trivial Z3 sector,
there is no need to use σ as the integrand of Eq. (14).
It is related with the study based on the nontrivial free
energy degeneracy in Ref. [13, 14]. Figure 4 shows T -
dependence of the quantity (15) with O = P and n = 1
where P is the pressure. We can see that this quantity
also describes the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition.
This behavior is, of course, trivial from the viewpoint of
the RW periodicity. It is interesting to calculate it in the
system with dynamical quarks and some theories where
we cannot easily calculate the chiral condensate.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have discussed the extension of
the eﬀective model such as the Polyakov-loop extended
Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model.
implications of
QCD properties in the imaginary chemical potential re-
gion to the eﬀective model construction has been dis-
cussed. Then the importance of the entanglement ver-
tex [18] has been explained from the derivation of the
eﬀective four-fermi interaction from QCD partition func-
tion with some approximations and ansatz.

Firstly,

6

Secondly, we have shown that the general form of the
entanglement vertex which should be needed to repro-
duce the lattice QCD prediction at ﬁnite µI [10, 11]. The
general form is refer to the structure of the gluon one-loop
eﬀective potential and the Bose distribution function and
then it naturally leads to the Z3 symmetric form.

Finally, the chiral condensate with diﬀerent Z3 sectors
and the dual quark condensate with n = 1 have been cal-
culated by using the PNJL model with the entanglement
vertex. The entanglement vertex has one parameter α
when we assume γ = 1 at least in the next leading-
order of e−βE. When α is mall, the chiral condensate
with the non-trivial Z3 sector increases even above TD,
but it decreases in the large-α case. This result suggests
that we can well remove the ambiguity of the parame-
ters by using the T -dependence of the chiral condensate
with the diﬀerent Z3 sectors. Also, we can ﬁnd visible
α-dependence in the dual quark condensate and thus this
quantity should be the promising quantity to remove the
ambiguity of the parameters. From qualitative behav-
ior of quenched lattice QCD data [29–31], we may ex-
clude extremely strong and weak α values, but we need
more quenched lattice QCD data to conclude it. In addi-
tion to above results, we propose new quantity which can
describe the conﬁnement-deconﬁnement transition based
on the dual quark condensate.
