Abstract

Lead-based halide perovskites are emerging as the most promising class of materials for

next generation optoelectronics. However, despite the enormous success of lead-halide per-

ovskite solar cells, the issues of stability and toxicity are yet to be resolved. Here we report

on the computational design and the experimental synthesis of a new family of Pb-free in-

organic halide double-perovskites based on bismuth or antimony and noble metals. Using

ﬁrst-principles calculations we show that this hitherto unknown family of perovskites exhibits

very promising optoelectronic properties, such as tunable band gaps in the visible range and

low carrier effective masses. Furthermore, we successfully synthesize the double perovskite

Cs2BiAgCl6, we perform structural reﬁnement using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and we

characterize its optical properties via optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements.
This new perovskite belongs to the Fm¯3m space group, and consists of BiCl6 and AgCl6 octa-
hedra alternating in a rock-salt face-centered cubic structure. From UV-Vis and PL measure-

ments we obtain an indirect gap of 2.2 eV. The new compound is very stable under ambient

conditions.

Perovskites are among the most fascinating crystals, and play important roles in a variety of ap-

plications, including ferroelectricity, piezzoelectricity, high-Tc superconductivity, ferromagnetism,
giant magnetoresistance, photocatalysis and photovoltaics.1–8 The majority of perovskites are ox-

ides and are very stable under ambient temperature and pressure conditions.4,9 However, this sta-

bility is usually accompanied by very large band gaps, therefore most oxide perovskites are not

suitable candidates for optoelectronic applications. The most noteworthy exceptions are the ferro-

electric perovskite oxides related to LiNbO3, BaTiO3, Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 and BiFeO3, which are being

actively investigated for photovoltaic applications, reaching power conversion efﬁciencies of up

to 8%.9 The past ﬁve years witnessed a revolution in optoelectronic research with the discovery

of the organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskite family. These solution-processable perovskites are

fast becoming the most promising materials for the next generation of solar cells, achieving efﬁ-

ciencies above 20%.10–13 Despite this breakthrough, hybrid lead-halide perovskites are known to

degrade due to moisture and heat,14 upon prolonged exposure to light,15 and are prone to ion or

halide vacancy migration, leading to unstable operation of photovoltaic devices.16,17 At the same

time the presence of lead raises concerns about the potential environmental impact of these mate-

rials.18,19 Given these limitations, identifying a stable, non-toxic halide perovskite optoelectronic

material is one of the key challenges to be addressed in the area of perovskite optoelectronics.

The starting point of our search for a lead-free halide-perovskite is the prototypical inorganic

compound of the family CsPbI3. CsPbI3 is an ABX3 perovskite where the heavy metal cations
Pb2+ and the halide anions I− occupy the B and X sites, respectively, while Cs+ occupies the A
site. The most obvious route to replacing Pb in this compound is via substitution of other group-

14 elements such as Sn and Ge. However both elements tend to undergo oxidation, for example

from Sn2+ to Sn4+, leading to a rapid degradation of the corresponding halide perovskites.20–23

More generally, it should also be possible to substitute lead by other divalent cations outside of

group-14 elements. However, our previous high-throughput computational screening of potential

candidates showed that the homovalent substitution of lead in halide perovskites impacts negatively

the optoelectronic properties by increasing band gaps and effective masses.24

3

Another possible avenue is to consider heterovalent substitution, that is the formation of a
double perovskite structure with a basic formula unit A2BB(cid:48)X6.4 This type of compounds are
abundant in the case of oxides and are well known for their ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and multi-

ferroic properties.4 Additionally, double perovskites have been explored in order to tune the band

gap of oxide perovskites.25,26 On the other hand, halide double perovskites remain a much less

explored class of materials. To date, the best known halide double perovskites are based on alkali

and rare-earth metals, and are investigated for applications as scintillators in radiation detectors.27
In order to replace the divalent Pb cations and maintain the total charge neutrality, the B(cid:48) and
B(cid:48)(cid:48) sites have to be occupied by one monovalent and one trivalent cation. We search for our
B(cid:48)3+ metallic cations among the pnictogens, and consider Bi and Sb as the most suitable choices.
Arsenic is less desirable owing to its toxicity. For the monovalent cations we choose the noble

metals Cu, Ag and Au. From elementary considerations Cu, Ag, and Au appear very promising

for optoelectronic applications. In fact, in their metallic form, the noble metals are the best known

electrical conductors, owing to their ﬁlled d10 shell and the free-electron-like behaviour of the s1

shell. In addition, in an octahedral environment, the ionic radii of Cu+ (0.91 Å), Ag+ (1.29 Å) and

Au+ (1.51 Å) are similar to those of Pb2+ (1.19 Å), Sb3+ (0.76 Å) and Bi3+ (1.03 Å).28 Following
this simple reasoning we investigate hypothetical halide double perovskites with the pairs B(cid:48)/B(cid:48)(cid:48)
where B(cid:48) = Sb, Bi, and B(cid:48)(cid:48) = Cu, Ag, Au.

We investigate the electronic properties of these hypothetical compounds from ﬁrst principles

using density functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA). We construct
‘rock-salt’ double perovskites, whereby B(cid:48) and B(cid:48)(cid:48) alternate in every direction (shown in Figure 1a).
The rock-salt ordering is known to be the ground state for most oxide double perovskites,4 there-

fore it can be expected to hold also in the present case. For each model structure we perform full

structural optimization using DFT-LDA and calculate the electronic band gaps using the hybrid

PBE0 functional as described in the Supporting Information.

In Figure 1b-c we show a comparative view of the band gaps calculated for the entire Cs2B(cid:48)B(cid:48)(cid:48)X6
family. We ﬁnd that all band gaps are below 2.7 eV, spanning the visible and near infrared optical

4

spectrum. The band gaps are indirect and increase as we move up the halogen or the pnictogen

column in the periodic table, but do not follow a monotonic trend with respect to the size of the

noble metal cation. This behaviour can be explained by the character of the electronic states at the

band edges. Indeed, a shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, the conduction band bot-

tom and valence band top in each case are predominantly of pnictogen-p and halogen-p character,

respectively. As we move up in the periodic table the energy of the halogen-p states decreases,

thus lowering the energy of the valence band top. Similarly, the energy of the pnictogen-p states

decreases when moving up in the periodic table, thus lowering the energy of the conduction band

bottom. The electron and hole effective masses calculated at the band edges exhibit an anisotropic

behaviour in most cases (see Table S1). Throughout the entire family of compounds the electron

masses are more isotropic than the hole masses. For clarity, in Figure 1 we report the transport

effective masses,29 as deﬁned in the Supporting Information. We note that all compounds ex-

hibit small carrier effective masses between 0.1 and 0.4 me, very close to those calculated for
CH3NH3PbI3 within the same level of theory.30

The electronic band structures of these halide double perovskites (shown in Figure S2 and S3)

exhibit several features of particular interest. In all cases, the valence band maximum (VBM) is at

the X (0,0,2π/a) point in the Brillouin zone. The conduction band minimum (CBM) is at Γ (0,0,0)

for Cs2BiAgCl6, Cs2BiCuCl6 and Cs2BiCuBr6, while for the other compounds the CBM is at the
L (π/a, π/a, π/a) point. The FCC cubic crystals of the former three compounds are indirect band

gap semiconductors, however a small disturbance of the conventional unit cell symmetry could

render the direct optical transition allowed. This is shown in Figure S4, where the band struc-

ture of Cs2BiAgCl6 is calculated in the conventional unit cell (which corresponds to two primitive

cells). Here, as a result of Brillouin zone folding in the conventional FCC unit cell, the band gap of

Cs2BiAgCl6 becomes direct at the Γ point. In practice, this effect could be realized by incorporat-
ing an organic cation, like methylammonium (CH3NH+
4 ) into the
cuboctahedral cavity. We illustrate this possibility by calculating the band structure of the hypo-

3 ) or formamidinium (CHN2H+

thetical orthorhombic CH3NH3BiAgCl6 (constructed as described in the Supporting Information);

5

as expected we obtain a direct band gap, as shown in Figure S5.

Having established that the family of A2BB(cid:48)X3 halide double perovskites, based on B = Sb,
Bi and B(cid:48) = Cu, Ag, Au exhibits promising optoelectronic properties, we move to the synthesis
and optical characterization of a representative member of this group of compounds. We adapt
the synthesis process of Cs2BiNaCl6, reported in Ref.,31 to allow for the incorporation of a noble
metal. Of the three noble metals under consideration, Ag has an ionic radius which is closest to

that of Na (1.02 Å vs 1.15 Å). For this reason we proceed to synthesize Cs2BiAgCl6 by conven-

tional solid-state reaction as described in detail in the Supporting Information. In Figure 2a we
show the X-ray Diffraction Pattern for a single crystal (∼30µm diameter). We observe sharp re-
ﬂections for the crystallographic 0kl, h0l and hk0 planes. These reﬂections show characteristics
of m¯3m symmetry that reveal systematic absences for (hkl; h + k, k + l, h + l = 2n) corresponding
to the face-centered space groups F432, F ¯43m and Fm¯3m. The latter was selected for structure

reﬁnement after conﬁrmation that Cs2BiAgCl6 crystallizes in an FCC lattice. We ﬁnd that there
is no signiﬁcant distortion of octahedral symmetry about the Bi3+. The atomic positions from the

structural reﬁnement are listed in Table S2 of the Supplementary Information. The X-ray diffrac-
tion patterns uniquely identify the Fm¯3m (no. 225) space group at room temperature, and the

quantitative structural analysis gives a very good description of the data. In addition, our crystal

structure reﬁnement is consistent with the rock-salt conﬁguration assumed by our atomistic model.

The experimental and computationally predicted conventional lattice parameters are in very good

agreement, 10.78 Å and 10.50 Å, respectively. From the optical absorption spectrum and Tauc

plot (see Figure 2b) we can estimate an indirect optical band gap in the range of 2.3-2.5 eV. The

indirect character of the band gap is consistent with the broad photoluminescence peak observed
between 480 and 650 nm (1.9-2.6 eV) with the maximum at ∼575 nm (2.2 eV), red-shifted with
respect to the optical absorption onset. In addition, the time-resolved photoluminescence decay

shown in Figure 2c was ﬁtted with a double exponential giving a fast component lifetime of 15 ns

and a slow component lifetime of 100 ns.

In Figure 3 we show the electronic band structure of Cs2BiAgCl6 calculated for the as deter-

6

mined experimental crystal structure, with and without relativistic spin-orbit coupling effects. The

features of the valence band edge are almost unchanged when the relativistic effects are included.

This is consistent with the predominant Cl-p and Ag-d character of this band. By contrast, due

to the large spin-orbit coupling, the conduction band edge splits in two bands, separated by more

than 1.5 eV at the Γ point. This effect is not surprising, given that the character of the conduc-

tion band bottom is of primarily Bi-p character. For comparison, in the case of Cs2SbAgCl6 (see
Figure S7) the spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band at the Γ point is of only 0.5 eV. The

fundamental band gap is reduced by 0.4 eV upon inclusion of relativistic effects, and the shape

of the conduction band is drastically different. Therefore, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling is

crucial for the correct description of the conduction band edge, bearing resemblance to the case of
CH3NH3PbI3.32,33 In the fully relativistic case we calculated an indirect band gap of 3.0 eV and
lowest direct transition of 3.5 eV, in very close agreement with the results obtained for the model

Cs2BiAgCl6 structure, discussed in Figure 1 [2.7 eV (indirect) and 3.3 eV (direct)]. The small

difference in band gap of 0.2-0.3 eV is due to the small difference in volume between the experi-

mental and predicted crystal structure. The calculated electronic band gaps are overestimated with

respect to the measured optical band gap by approximately 0.5 eV. This quantitative discrepancy

does not affect the qualitative physical trends of the band gaps discussed throughout this work, and

can be associated to the approximations employed in our PBE0 calculations. A better agreement

with experiment can be reached by ﬁne-tuning the fraction of exact exchange, or by performing

GW calculations.34,35 The latter will be reported in a future work.

In summary, through a combined theoretical and experimental study, we have designed a new

family of halide double-perovskite semiconductors based on pnictogens and noble metals. These

compounds have promising electronic properties, such as low carrier effective masses and band

gaps covering the visible and near-infrared region of the optical spectrum. All compounds are

indirect gap semiconductors and exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling. We successfully synthesized

Cs2BiAgCl6, and obtained a face-centered cubic double perovskite, exhibiting optical properties

consistent with an indirect gap semiconductor, in agreement with our computational predictions.

7

The present work is the ﬁrst detailed description of the structure and optoelectronic properties of

the pnictogen-noble metal halide double perovskite family, and calls for many future experimental

and theoretical studies in order to assess the full potential of these new materials. We expect that

a complete mapping of the genome of halide double perovskites based on pnictogens and noble

metals may unlock a world of new exciting optoelectronic materials for solar cells, photodetectors,

light-emitting devices, and transistors.

During the preparation of this manuscript we became aware of the publication of two related pa-

Γ (0,0,0) - X (0,0,2π/a) without (left) and with (right) spin-orbit coupling. The black points on
the fully relativistic band structure marked ‘i-iv’ mark the conduction band bottom at L and Γ
and the valence band top at Γ and X, respectively. For each of the states we show the electronic
wavefunctions. The conduction band bottom is primarily of Bi-p and Cl-p character, while the
valence band top consists of Ag-d and Cl-p character. The shape of all four wavefunctions is
consistent with metal-halide σ-bonds.
