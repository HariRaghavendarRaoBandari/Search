Scaling limit and convergence of smoothed covariance for

gradient models with non-convex potential

Susanne Hilger

March 16, 2016

Abstract

A discrete gradient model for interfaces is studied. The interaction potential is a
non-convex perturbation of the quadratic gradient potential. Based on a representa-
tion for the ﬁnite volume Gibbs measure obtained via a renormalization group analysis
by Adams, Koteck´y and M¨uller in [AKM] it is proven that the scaling limit is a con-
tinuum massless Gaussian free ﬁeld. From probabilistic point of view, this is a Central
Limit Theorem for strongly dependent random ﬁelds. Additionally, the convergence of
covariances, smoothed on a scale smaller than the system size, is proven.

Introduction

We analyze discrete gradient models which are eﬀective models for random interfaces. Let
Λ ⊂ Zd be a ﬁnite set. To each conﬁguration ϕ ∈ RΛ (ϕ(x) can be interpreted as the height
of the interface at site x) an energy HΛ(ϕ) is assigned, where the Hamiltonian is assumed
to be of gradient type,

d

HΛ(ϕ) = Xx∈Λ

Xi=1

W (∇iϕ(x)) with ∇iϕ(x) = ϕ(x + ei) − ϕ(x).

We consider tilted boundary conditions, i.e., for u ∈ Rd

ψu(x) = x · u for x ∈ ∂Λ = {z ∈ Zd \ Λ : |z − x| = 1 for some x ∈ Λ}.

The ﬁnite volume Gibbs measure for inverse temperature β is given by

γψu
Λ (dϕ) =

1
Z ψu
Λ

e−βHΛ(ϕ) Yx∈Λ

dϕ(x) Yx∈∂Λ

δψu(x)(dϕ(x))

where Z ψu
Λ is the partition function which normalizes the measure. Later it will be more
convenient to work with periodic boundary condition rather than Dirichlet boundary condi-
tion because the problem then remains translation invariant. Imposing a tilt u corresponds

1

to working with functions such that x 7→ ϕ − x · u is periodic. This can be reduced to the
study of periodic functions by replacing the expression W (∇iϕ(x)) in the Hamiltonian by
W (∇iϕ(x) + ui), see (2.4) below. For the equivalence of various ways of imposing a tilt, at
least on the level of the thermodynamic limit of the free energy, see [KL14].

In the case of strictly convex, symmetric W a lot is known: The inﬁnite volume gradient
Gibbs measure exists and is uniquely determined by the tilt [FS97]. The long distance
behaviour is described by the Gaussian free ﬁeld (see [NS97] and [GOS01]) and the decay
of the covariance is polynomial as in the massless Gaussian case [DD05]. Moreover the
surface tension is strictly convex [DGI00]. A nice overview of these results and the used
techniques can be found in [Fun05] or [Vel06].

Much less is known for models with non-convex potentials. At moderate temperature and
zero tilt Biskup and Koteck´y showed in [BK07] the existence of two ergodic inﬁnite volume
Gibbs measures for a particular non-convex potential, a mixture of two centered Gaussians.
For this potential it can nevertheless be shown that both gradient Gibbs measures scale to
a Gaussian free ﬁeld [BS11].
The high temperature regime of potentials of the form

W (η) = W0(η) + g0(η), W0 strictly convex , pβkgkL1 small

is analyzed in [CDM09] and [CD12]. The authors prove strict convexity of the surface
tension, uniqueness of the ergodic gradient Gibbs measure, scaling to the Gaussian free

ﬁeld and polynomial decay of the covariance for any tilt. Note that smallness of √βkgkL1

still allows for non-convex W .
For low temperatures a ﬁnite range decomposition of the Gaussian measure and renormal-
ization group techniques in the spirit of [Bry09] can be used to get ﬁrst results for potentials
which are small non-convex perturbations of the quadratic potential, i.e.,

W (η) =

1
2

η2 + V (η),

V small, but W nonconvex.

In [AKM] a representation for the ﬁnite volume Gibbs measure is obtained and is applied
there to show strict convexity of the surface tension for small tilt u.
The objective of this note is to use the results of [AKM] to prove a Central Limit Theorem
for these models and to show that their behaviour at long distances is governed by a suitable
Gaussian free ﬁeld. On a slightly ﬁner scale we also prove convergence of the covariances
of this model.

Note that in estimates a constant is always denoted by C but can change from line to line.

Following [FS97], we enforce tilted boundary conditions and simultaneously shift invariance
by considering ﬁelds on the torus and a shifted potential W (· + ui): For L > 0 a large ﬁxed

Remark. To simplify the notation we set β = 1 in the following. Note further that we do
not make explicit the dependence on u in the notation since it plays no special role here.

2.2 Results
For computing the scaling limit we deﬁne, for f ∈ C ∞

c (Td; Rd),

f N (x) ..= L−N d

and introduce the slowly varying scaled ﬁeld

We describe the distribution of this random vector by the Laplace transform

(2.8)

We are interested in the existence of some limiting distribution (∇ϕ)scale which is in
general a random ﬁeld on distributions. Then the limiting distribution, if it exists, is
the joint distribution νscale for generalized gradient random ﬁelds (cid:0)(∇ϕ)scale(f )(cid:1)f ∈C∞

We will show that for small initial perturbation of the quadratic potential the measure
νHN tends to a continuum Gaussian free ﬁeld with a renormalized covariance in the sense
of convergence of Laplace transforms of the measures.
For stating the smallness condition on V we introduce the second order Taylor remainder
U of V ,

and set, for z ∈ Rd,

U (s, t) = V (s + t) − V (t) − V ′(t)s,

typical one in Central Limit Theorems. The classical Central Limit Theorem cannot be
applied due to the long-range gradient-gradient correlations of the measure.

Theorem 2.1 captures the limiting behaviour if we average over the whole system of scale
LdN and rescale. If we are not interested in the full distribution but only in covariances
we can also show convergence to the covariances of a Gaussian measure if we only average
over LαdN many points, α < 1. To state this result precisely ﬁx a, b ∈ Rd and, for z = a, b,

functions on Rd.

3 Outline of the Proofs

The proofs of Theorem 2.1 and 2.2 rely on a representation for the ﬁnite volume Gibbs
measure constructed in [AKM]. There, the measure νHN is written as perturbation of a
Gaussian measure µq, i.e., νHN = F q
0 (ϕ)µq. In [AKM13] µq is decomposed into Gaussian

k(ϕ), where H q

It can be shown that the eﬀective interactions F q
k are expressed as the composition of
a ’relevant’ term e−H q
k(ϕ) is quadratic and local in ∇ϕ, and an ’irrelevant
term’ K q
k(ϕ) such that the map Kk 7→ Kk+1 is a contraction in suitable norms. From this
contraction property one can deduce a Stable Manifold Theorem for the evolution of the
(H q
k, K q
k ) variables. This gives the possibility to choose q such that the initial perturbation
F q
0 lies on the stable manifold. Hence after N steps a nice representation, which corresponds
to H q

N = 0, is obtained.

In the following we ﬁrst give a precise statement of corresponding result in [AKM] and
collect useful consequences. Then we give a sketch of the proof of Theorem 2.1 and Theo-
rem 2.2. In the next Section we provide the detailed proofs.

3.1 Representation for νHN

To state the result in [AKM] we have to introduce some objects. First of all we rewrite
the Gibbs measure νHN (dϕ) as perturbation of a Gaussian measure µq, q ∈ Rd×d
sym, with
covariance Cq = (Aq)−1, where

Aq =Xi,j

(δij + qij)∇∗

j∇i.

(3.2)

For this recall that U is the second order Taylor remainder of V , i.e.,

and insert artiﬁcially the so called ﬁne-tuning parameters 1

Furthermore we need the norm on the irrelevant part used in the last integration step
in (3.1). In the following several constants will appear which are needed for the construction
in [AKM] but they will not be explained or motivated here.
First we deﬁne a norm on ﬁelds ϕ ∈ RΛN by

(3.12)

Note that, in comparison to [AKM], we skip any dependencies of maps on subsets X ⊂ ΛN
since we do not need it here.

Let

µq = µq

1 ∗ . . . ∗ µq

N +1

be a decomposition of µq into Gaussian measures with range on increasing blocks, see
[AKM13] for an exact deﬁnition and for existence of such a decomposition whenever q
is small enough, i.e., kqk ≤ 1
2 where the norm kqk is the operator norm of q viewed as
operator on Rd equipped with the metric |q|l2 =(cid:0)Pi |qi|2(cid:1)
F ∗ µ(ξ) =Z F (ϕ + ξ)µ(dϕ).

In the following Proposition we use the notation

Proposition 3.1

There exist positive constants ρ, ρ1 ≤ 1
2 , ζ and η ∈ (0, 1), η independent on N , such
that for suitable chosen constants L, h, ω and r0 and for any K with kKkζ ≤ ρ there is a
parameter q = q(K, N ) with kqk ≤ ρ1 satisfying

such that

F ∗ µq(ξ) = 1 +Z KN (ϕ + ξ) µq

N +1(dϕ)

kKNkN,ΛN ≤ C ηN .

(3.13)

(3.14)

A choice for L, h, ω and r0 is made in [AKM], Proposition 4.6. The existence of the
constants ρ, ρ1 and ζ and of the parameter q and the formula (3.13) can be found in [AKM],
Theorem 4.9. The exponential decay of the norm (3.14) is a consequence of Proposition
8.1 and of the construction of the corresponding Banachspace in Subsection 4.5, both in
[AKM].

From the results in [AKM] one can also deduce the following estimate on maps F on ﬁelds.

Lemma 3.2
For any s ≤ r0 it holds

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Z DsF (ϕ + ξ)(ξ1, . . . , ξs)µq

. . . |ξs|N,ΛN kFkN,ΛN (cid:16)wΛN

N (ξ)(cid:17)2

.

Proof. By looking carefully at the deﬁnition of the norm k · kN,ΛN one can easily obtain
the following estimate:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Z DsF (ϕ + ξ)(ξ1, . . . , ξs)µq

N +1(dϕ).

An adjustment of the proof of Lemma 5.2 in [AKM] (there the case k = N is excluded)
gives

In fact the adjustment is a huge simpliﬁcation since we do not have to deal with the
boundary terms which the authors of [AKM] have to for the scales k < N .

3.2 Sketch of the proofs

In order to apply Proposition 3.1 for the computation of the scaling limit and the smoothed
covariance we do the following key calculation: By completing the square and linear trans-
formation we get for a Gaussian measure µC

Z e−(ϕ,f )F (ϕ)µC (dϕ) =

Now we apply the representation (3.13) in Proposition 3.1, Lemma 3.2 and the bound
(3.14) in Proposition (3.1) to see that

|F ∗ µq(0) − 1| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

By the same reasoning,

For the proof of Theorem 2.2 note that we can compute the covariance by taking derivatives
of the logarithm of a generating functional. For a measure ν = 1
Z e−H dλ and random
variables X and Y it holds

Covν(X, Y ) = ∂s∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=t=0

lnZ e−(sX+tY )e−H dλ.

(3.16)

Proof of Theorem 2.2, main ideas. We use the representation of the covariance (3.16) as
follows

As in the proof of Theorem 2.1 it holds by the use of Proposition 3.1

|F ∗ µq(0) − 1| ≤ CηN wΛN

and thus the denominators in (3.17) tend to 1 as N tends to inﬁnity. Employing Lemma 3.2
and (3.14) in Proposition 3.1 we further get

The exponential decay ηN allows us to consider values α ≤ 1. In Lemma 4.8 we show that
there exist a decreasing function τ satisfying τ (1) = 1 such that

This gives the possibility to choose α0 < 1 as small as possible such that ητ (α0)2 < 1 and
hence (ητ (α)2)N → 0 as N tends to inﬁnity for all α ∈ [α0, 1].
Then it only remains to show

(cid:12)(cid:12)Cq gN

z (cid:12)(cid:12)N,ΛN ≤ C τ (α)N .

This is done in Subsection 4.2, Proposition 4.6.

a ,Cq gN
(cid:0)gN

b (cid:1) → (div Ja,C div Jb)L2 .

Remark. For higher moments (say of order s) one has to choose α0 such that

ητ (α0)s < 1

s( d

2 +4)

which implies α0 > 1− − ln η
(see the formula for τ (α) in Lemma 4.8) so α0 → 1 as s → ∞.
Estimates of correlation functions can be done in more generality by inserting external
ﬁelds into the partition function and extending the ﬂow of (H q
k) to these observable
variables, compare [BBS14]. This amounts to extending norm estimates in [AKM] to the
case of included variables and computing explicitly the ﬂow of the observables. We plan
to pursue this in future work.

operator AN are related as follows:

4.2 Convergence of the operators

Since the ﬁne-tuning parameter qN obtained in Proposition 3.1 is uniformly bounded by 1/2
we get the following convergence result.

Lemma 4.4

sym and a subsequence (Nk)k such that

where we use the convention that ∂∗
by the Lax-Milgram Theorem there is a (unique up to the addition of constants) solution
u ∈ W 1,2(Td) such that for g ∈ L2(Td) we have Au = div∗ g in Td and a (unique up to the
addition of constants) solution u ∈ W 1,2
loc (Rd) with Du ∈ L2(Rd) such that for g ∈ L2(Rd)
we have Au = div∗ g in Rd.

Proposition 4.5

Let uN = CN div∗
N f ∈ χ′

Extend uN and fN to piecewise constant functions on the continuous torus Td. Divide Td
into cubes Qx of side length L−N with centres x ∈ Λ′
N and deﬁne uN (y) = uN (x) for all
y ∈ Qx. It follows from the deﬁnition of the extension (recall also the deﬁnition of div∗
N in
(4.1)) that

N fN (see Proposition 4.1)

hdiv∗

N fN , uNil2 = (div∗

15

Let u ∈ W 1,2(Td) be the solution (unique up to the addition of constants) to Au = div∗ f
on Td. From Proposition 4.1 it follows that DN uN is uniformly bounded in L2(Td). Below
in Steps 1-3 we show that on a subsequence DN uN ⇀ Du in L2(Td). Then

= (fN − f, DN uN )L2(Td;Rd) + (f, DN uN − Du)L2(Td;Rd)
≤ kfN − fkL2kDN uNkL2 + (f, DN uN − Du)L2 .

By construction of fN and by the bound on DN uN the ﬁrst term tends to zero as N → ∞
and by the weak convergence of DN uN this also holds for the second term. Thus the claim
follows.
Step 1: From the bound on DN uN we get existence of v ∈ L2(Td; Rd) such that on a
subsequence Nk

DNk uNk ⇀ v in L2(Td; Rd).

Step 2: There is u ∈ L2(Td) such that v = Du (in the sense of weak derivatives).
Proof: Let ¯uN := 1

|Td|RTd uN dx. We use the discrete Poincar´e inequality and Step 1 to get

kuN − ¯uNkL2 ≤ CkDN uNkL2 ≤ C.

Thus there is a subsequence (not denoted explicitly in the following) and u ∈ L2(Td) such
that uN − ¯uN ⇀ u in L2(Td).
We take ϕ ∈ W 1,2(Td; Rd) to obtain the following convergence as N → ∞:

Z DN uN · ϕ dx =Z (uN − ¯uN ) div∗

N ϕ dx →Z u div∗ ϕ dx =Z Du · ϕ dx.

On the other hand we have by Step 1 for any ϕ ∈ L2(Td; Rd)

ZTd

DN uN ϕ dx →ZTd

vϕ dx

as N tends to inﬁnity. Thus u is weakly diﬀerentiable and Du = v.
Step 3: The function u in Step 2 satisﬁes the equation Au = div∗ f and thus is unique up
to the addition of constants.
Proof: For ϕ ∈ C 1(Td) let ϕN be the function obtained by restriction to Λ′
N and piecewise
constant extension to Td and insert ϕN into the weak form of the equation satisﬁed by uN
to obtain

Xi,j Z aN

i,jDN,iuN DN,jϕN dx =Z fN · DN ϕN dx.

16

Now DN,jϕN converges uniformly to ∂jϕ. Hence the left hand side converges to

Pi,jR ai,j∂iu∂jϕ dx and the right hand side converges to R f · Dϕ dx. Thus

Xi,j Z ai,j∂iu∂jϕ dx =Z f · Dϕ dx

for all ϕ ∈ C 1(Td). By density the identity holds for all ϕ ∈ W 1,2(Td) and this ﬁnishes the
proof.

The proof of the following Proposition is very similar to the proof of Proposition 4.5. We
just have to take into account that in this case we have to work on increasing tori.

Proposition 4.6

corresponding scaled functions J N

the proof of Proposition 4.5.

uN − ¯uN ⇀ u in L2

The rest of the argument is exactly as in the proof of Proposition 4.5.

constants.

4.3 Smallness of error terms
