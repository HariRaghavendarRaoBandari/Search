Within a Kubo formalism, we study dc transport and ac optical properties of 3D Dirac and Weyl
semimetals. Emphasis is placed on the approach to charge neutrality and on the diﬀerences between
Dirac and Weyl materials. At charge neutrality, the zero-temperature limit of the dc conductivity
is not universal and also depends on the residual scattering model employed. However, the Lorenz
number L retains its usual value L0. With increasing temperature, the Wiedemann-Franz law is
violated. At high temperatures, L exhibits a new plateau at a value dependent on the details of the
scattering rate. Such details can also appear in the optical conductivity, both in the Drude response
and interband background. In the clean limit, the interband background is linear in photon energy
and always extrapolates to the origin. This background can be shifted to the right through the
introduction of a massless gap. In this case, the extrapolation can cut the axis at a ﬁnite photon
energy as is observed in some experiments. It is also of interest to diﬀerentiate between the two
types of Weyl semimetals: those with broken time-reversal symmetry and those with broken spatial-
inversion symmetry. We show that, while the former will follow the same behaviour as the 3D Dirac
semimetals, for the zero magnetic ﬁeld properties discussed here, the latter type will show a double
step in the optical conductivity at ﬁnite doping and a single absorption edge at charge neutrality.
The Drude conductivity is always ﬁnite in this case, even at charge neutrality.

INTRODUCTION

The last ten years have seen a remarkably rapid devel-
opment of an entirely new direction in condensed mat-
ter physics, that of so-called Dirac materials and the
related area of topological insulators. The origins of
this novel ﬁeld reach back to 1947 when Wallace pro-
vided the low-energy dispersion of two-dimensional (2D)
graphene1. Decades later, it was the seminal work of
Semenoﬀ2 and others which recognized that the 2D hon-
eycomb lattice could provide a solid state analogue for
2D massless Dirac fermions. This provided the possi-
bility for a condensed matter manifestation of phenom-
ena previously discussed in the context of high energy
physics.3,4 The subsequent isolation of graphene5,6 and
explosion of experimental results3,4 verifying its exotic
phenomena, have proved one of the most exciting devel-
opments of the last decade. Such success has emboldened
scientists to seek further variations on the theme of Dirac
materials. Initial investigations focused on 2D systems,
proposing adaptations such as strain, buckling, etc. and
expanding to bilayers and other conﬁgurations.

A parallel development, also based on the honeycomb
lattice, was the suggestion by Kane and Mele of a 2D
topological insulator (TI) phase7,8 induced by a spin-
orbit energy gap which could give rise to a quantum spin
Hall eﬀect. Insulating in the bulk, these materials har-
bour conducting edge states. Other researchers furthered
these ideas to examine the eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling in
three-dimensional (3D) materials to produce 3D TIs9–11.
These also house insulating bulk states but with Dirac-
like surface states9–11. This led to the discovery of a host

of materials providing evidence for these new phases of
matter. Key to this development has been the power of
density functional theory (DFT) to provide predictions of
materials that would manifest TI and Dirac states of mat-
ter (see, for example, Refs.12–16). The success of these
methods, coupled with the experimental realization of
these materials and conﬁrmation of the Dirac physics,
has given rise to an overwhelming amount of research in
a very short time.

With the success of the graphene ﬁeld and the 3D TI
development with its attendant 2D Dirac surface state,
it became natural to contemplate the possibility of a 3D
analogue to the 2D Dirac system. This implies a dis-
persion which is linear at low energy in all three k-space
directions with particle and hole states above and below a
node. The term 3D Dirac semimetal (DSM) is now being
used to describe such a state and, near the Dirac point, it
is characterized by a 4x4 Hamiltonian17,18. For the DSM,
there exists a twofold degeneracy in the conduction and
valence bands. This degeneracy can be lifted in a crys-
tal which is noncentrosymmetric (spatial-inversion sym-
metry breaking) or has time-reversal symmetry breaking
facilitated by magnetism, for example19,20.
In the for-
mer, the degenerate Dirac cone is split into two cones
that are shifted in energy relative to each other. In the
latter case, the two cones are shifted in k-space. The two
nondegenerate cones are referred to as Weyl cones with
Weyl points due to their low-energy behaviour mapping
to a 2x2 Weyl Hamiltonian instead of a Dirac Hamilto-
nian. As they result from the splitting of a Dirac cone,
Weyl cones always come in pairs of nondegenerate cones
of opposite chirality21. This type of material is termed

a Weyl semimetal (WSM). While the bulk WSM has a
low-energy linear dispersion about the Weyl point, the
surface of the WSM is predicted to have Fermi arcs whose
tips are linked, through projection, to the two bulk Weyl
points of opposite chirality. These materials are expected
to demonstrate exotic properties such as large negative
magnetoresistance in the presence of parallel electric and
magnetic ﬁelds due to the chiral anomaly22,23. Hence,
there has been considerable excitement and intense re-
search to ﬁnd real materials which demonstrate the be-
haviour of 3D WSMs and also 3D DSMs.

41, etc.

Over this last year, experimental realizations of
24–27 and
3D DSMs have been announced in Cd3As2
Na3Bi28,29, with other related possibilities discussed
in quasicrystals30, HgCdTe31 and other
systems32.
WSMs have now been reported in TaAs33–37 and
NbAs38 for WSMs with broken spatial-inversion sym-
metry and YbMnBi2 for a WSM with broken time-
reversal symmetry39. Other candidate systems for WSMs
might be TI heterostructures40, pyrochlore irridates21,
HgCr2Se4
Indeed, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments are conﬁrming the
presence of the linear dispersions and the existence of
Fermi arcs. There is also work on the cyclotron or-
bits that result from these surface state arcs42,43 which
have spin texture44. Very recently, a ﬂurry of activity
has occurred surrounding the negative magnetoresistance
expected and observed due to the chiral anomaly45–54.
Clearly, these are exciting developments and the ﬁeld is
on the edge of a huge outpouring of new developments
in both theory and experiment. In this context, we con-
sider predictions for dc transport measurements and ﬁ-
nite frequency conductivity in zero magnetic ﬁeld with
application to both DSMs and WSMs.

In the realm of dc and ac magneto-electrical transport,
several theoretical works have already appeared, cover-
ing a range of topics from weak to strong disorder, diﬀer-
ent types of impurity scattering including charge impu-
rity scattering, electron screening, and so forth. For fur-
ther information, the reader is directed to Refs.20,23,55–64.
Here, we only study the case of zero magnetic ﬁeld
and follow the lead of Lundgren et al.17 by examining
three models for diﬀerent types of impurity scattering
to determine their eﬀect on longitudinal electrical trans-
port properties, considering a single DSM or WSM cone.
Speciﬁcally, we consider: a constant scattering rate, the
weak scattering (Born) limit, and the case of charge im-
purities. We calculate the dc and ac conductivities, the
thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coeﬃcient, and the
Lorenz number of the Wiedemann-Franz law. We con-
trast the results obtained from the Kubo formula with
those of the Boltzmann equation. Most of the litera-
ture has taken the Boltzmann approach; we ﬁnd that
the Kubo formulation provides an extra term beyond the
Boltzmann result which becomes signiﬁcant in the limit
of µ → 0 for µ < (Γ, T ), where µ is the chemical potential
measured from the nodal point, T is the temperature,
and Γ is the impurity scattering rate. We ﬁnd speciﬁc

2

signatures of this extra term in these properties and are
able to provide analytical results for several limits.

The dynamical conductivity is of particular interest
given that a small amount of preliminary theoretical work
has been done40,56,65–67 emphasizing the linear in photon
frequency interband background and the modiﬁcation in
a magnetic ﬁeld. Likewise, experiments on various ma-
terials have been observing this linear conductivity in
68, Kane fermions in Hg-Cd-Te31,
quasicrystals30, ZrTe5
69, and WSM TaAs70.
the pyrochlore irridate Eu2Ir2O7
This gives impetus to provide a more detailed descrip-
tion of the optical conductivity for DSMs and WSMs.
A feature in some of the data is a non-zero positive-
frequency intercept in the linear conductivity which is
diﬃcult to explain in the simple theory. Consequently,
we consider the case of a massless gapped DSM to illus-
trate a way of obtaining this feature in the conductivity.
Such a model was proposed by Benfatto et al.71,72 for
graphene to explain some anomalous optical data in the
literature73. More recently, this model has been proposed
in 3D for a system with a Hubbard U Mott gap74. We
ﬁnd such a model more eﬀective at explaining the data
in 3D DSMs. As a ﬁnal contribution to the WSM litera-
ture, we provide the optical conductivity that would be
expected for a WSM which is formed through the break-
ing of spatial-inversion symmetry. In this case, there will
be two steps in the linear interband conductivity, which
is distinct from the conductivity of a WSM with time-
reversal symmetry breaking, and therefore would provide
a clear signature of which type of WSM one has, i.e., the
type with the cones separated in energy versus that with
a separation in momentum.

The structure of our paper is as follows. In Sec. II.A,
we discuss the dc results for the electrical conductivity,
examining the eﬀects of three models for impurity scat-
tering and contrasting the Kubo formula75 result with
that from the Boltzmann approach76–80. Temperature
dependence is also included. Subsection B discusses the
Lorenz number and the Wiedemann-Franz law, along
with the Seebeck coeﬃcient S. The detailed results for
S and the thermal conductivity κ are given in Appendix
B, while Appendix A provides the Kubo approach to the
optical conductivity at any frequency.
In Sec. III, we
treat the ac conductivity for various impurity models,
including a look at the optical spectral weight variation
with temperature. This section pertains to 3D DSMs
and 3D WSMs with time-reversal symmetry breaking.
In Sec. IV, we examine the diﬀerences in the optical con-
ductivity that would occur for the WSM with broken-
spatial inversion symmetry where clear signatures of this
state would occur. Finally, continuing on the theme of
optical conductivity, the eﬀect of a massless gap on the
conductivity of a DSM/WSM is presented in Sec. V, mo-
tivated by the experiments which display deviations from
the simple theory. Both the dc and ac conductivity are
discussed for a constant scattering rate. Our ﬁnal con-
clusions are found in Sec. VI.

II. DC TRANSPORT

In the following, we shall discuss results for a single
Dirac cone in 3D described by a low-energy Hamiltonian
of the form

ˆH = ¯hvF σ · k,

(1)

where k = (kx, ky, kz) is the 3D wavevector, σ =
(σx, σy, σz) is the 3D vector of Pauli matrices and vF
is the Fermi velocity. This Hamiltonian gives the en-
ergy dispersion εk = ±¯hvF |k|. To include more valleys
through a valley degeneracy gv or a spin degeneracy gs,
a multiplicative degeneracy factor of g = gsgv is all that
is needed for modifying the results. For the properties
calculated in this paper, this will apply for both DSMs
and WSMs with time-reversal symmetry breaking. Mod-
iﬁcation to these results for WSMs with spatial-inversion
symmetry breaking will be discussed later as a superpo-
sition of the DSM results (see Sec. IV).

A. Conductivity

the dc conductivity obtained from the Kubo formula
[Eqn. (A12)] is

∂f (ω)

∂ω (cid:19) ω2 + 3Γ(ω)2

2Γ(ω)

,

(2)

where f (ω) = [exp([ω −µ]/T )+1]−1 is the Fermi function
(with the Boltzmann constant kB = 1). This expression
applies to any energy-dependent impurity scattering rate
model Γ(ω). For simplicity, we have neglected the corre-
sponding real part of the self-energy which is related to its
imaginary part [Γ(ω)] through Kramers-Kronig transfor-
mation. At zero temperature, the conductivity reduces
to

σdc = σ0

µ2 + 3Γ(µ)2

Γ(µ)

,

(3)

where σ0 ≡ e2/(12π2¯h3vF ) and µ is the chemical poten-
tial which describes charge doping away from the neu-
trality point. The ﬁrst term in Eqn. (3) is recognized
as the result one would ﬁnd via the Boltzmann equation
approach. It is proportional to the electronic density of
states N (ω) at the Fermi energy (∝ µ2 in 3D) and to
1/Γ(µ), the scattering time at ω = µ. We stress that
this term has the form of the single contribution to σdc
obtained in the work of Lundgren et al. (Ref.17) based
on a Boltzmann equation approach to which we wish to
compare. Later when we consider other DC transport
coeﬃcients, we will again compare speciﬁcally with the
results of Ref.17 which we will refer to as the Boltzmann
term. Returning to Eqn. (3), the second term goes like
the scattering rate itself rather than its inverse and is not
part of the work of Ref.17. If this second term is neglected

3

and the scattering rate is interpreted as a transport scat-
tering rate, the remaining term is identical in both the
Kubo and Boltzmann approaches. Here, we will consider
three possible impurity models. First, we take Γ(ω) to
be independent of energy (i.e. Γ(ω) = Γ0 = constant).
The second case is the weak-scattering model17 which can
be treated in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory and gives a
scattering rate proportional to the density of states. That
is, Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2, with constant Γ1 in units of one over
energy. Finally, we consider the long-range Coulomb im-
purity model described in the work of Burkov et al.55
and used by Lundgren et al.17 to describe transport in
Dirac materials within the Boltzmann equation formu-
lation. In this case, it is envisaged that the number of
charge impurities is equal to the doping (n) away from
the Dirac point. Consequently, Γ(ω) is proportional to
n ∝ µ3 giving Γ(ω) = Γ2µ3/ω2, where Γ2 is a dimension-
less constant.

The constant scattering rate model is phenomenologi-
cal in nature and makes no assumption about the micro-
scopic origin of the impurity scattering involved. It is im-
portant and is extensively used in discussions of transport
and optical properties as it often captures much of the es-
sential underlying physics. Nonetheless, as our work will
show, the observation of deviations from this model can
provide valuable information on the type of the impurity
centers involved.

The long range Coulomb impurity model was elabo-
rated upon in the work of Burkov et al.55. The idea is
that each impurity center is charged with charge trans-
ferred to the semimetal. In this case, which can actually
be realized in some semimetals, the number of impurity
centers and the doping are the same. This model was
further employed in the Boltzmann equation approach
to the transport properties of Dirac-Weyl semimetals de-
scribed in the work of Ref.17 with which we will want
to compare. While this speciﬁc model is important in
its own right, here it also serves to illustrate how it can
provide diﬀerences from the very simpliﬁed constant rate
phenomenological model as well as from weak scattering
in the Born approximation. In this last case, there is no
compelling microscopic reason for relating the number
of impurities to the number of dopants. Studying both
models independently covers a suﬃcient range of possible
impurity models to give the reader a good idea of how
such details can aﬀect transport and optical properties.
For a constant scattering rate, the second term of
Eqn. (3) (proportional to Γ0) dominates the approach
to charge neutrality which corresponds to µ → 0. This is
shown in Fig. 1(a). The solid black line gives the conduc-
tivity in units of σ0Γ0 as a function of µ/Γ0. This result
is to be compared with the open blue circles which give
σdc as a function of µ when only the ﬁrst term in Eqn. (3)
is used (Boltzmann limit). For µ → 0, σdc/(σ0Γ0) takes
a value of 3 while using the Boltzmann equation alone
would give zero. Note that the dc conductivity at the
Dirac point is not universal as it would be in graphene
but is directly proportional to Γ0. For ﬁnite scattering, it

trast to Γ(ω) = Γ0, as the Dirac point is approached in
the limit µ → 0, it is the Boltzmann term of Eqn. (3)
that dominates and gives the charge neutral value of the
conductivity (σ0/Γ1). Comparing the solid black curve
(which contains both terms) with the open blue circles of
the Boltzmann alone, we see that it is the second term of
Eqn. (3) which controls the deviation away from µ = 0
and gives a µ2 correction to the µ = 0 value. The dashed
red curve gives the µ dependence of the scattering rate in
the normalized units indicated on the right vertical axis.
For the constant scattering rate model, the approach to
the Dirac point falls in the region where Γ(µ)/µ > 1
(blue shaded region) while for the weak scattering case,
it occurs when Γ(µ)/µ < 1 (green shaded region). This
is consistent with our ﬁnding that the Boltzmann ap-
proach gives the correct limit at the Dirac point in the
latter model but not in the former. The Boltzmann de-
scription is expected to apply when Γ(µ) < µ and not
when Γ(µ) > µ.

A diﬀerent pattern emerges when long-range impuri-
ties are considered [shown in Fig. 1(c)]. In that case, the
condition Γ(µ) < µ always applies as we expect Γ2 ≪ 1.
In this model, the conductivity (solid black line) is lin-
ear in µ and the dc value at µ = 0 is indeed zero. Also,
the second term in Eqn. (3) is never important; it simply
changes the slope of the black line by a small amount.

To summarize at this point, it is clear from these con-
siderations that the Kubo formula approach to the dc
conductivity can give signiﬁcant corrections to the usual
Boltzmann method. Also, the diﬀerent scattering mod-
els can drastically aﬀect the approach to the Dirac point
(both the value of σdc at µ = 0 and the power law in µ
with which the asymptotic value is reached for µ → 0).
For the long-range Coulomb model, the impurity scat-
tering rate is constrained by identifying the number of
scattering centres with the number of holes described
by a negative value of µ. In the other models, no such
constraint is imposed; therefore, from here on, we will
present results mainly for the ﬁrst two models which we
denote model I (Γ(ω) = Γ0) and model II (Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2).

respectively.
It is of interest to compare these results
with the equivalent case of graphene. Graphene is the
2D version of a 3D Dirac Hamiltonian. Results for the

In contrast to the 3D system,
the limit T → 0 or µ → 0 leads to a universal minimum
conductivity which is independent of the scattering rate
and equal to 4e2/(πh). For the constant scattering rate
in 3D, we get σdc(T → 0) = 3σ0Γ0 where Γ0 does not
drop out. However, σdc(T → 0)/Γ0 is universal for a
given vF , independent of the scattering rate.

Results for the temperature dependence of the con-
ductivity are presented in Fig. 2. Models I and II are
shown in frames (a) and (b), respectively. Again, scal-
ings have been introduced on both axis so that a single
curve labelled by µ0/Γ0 [frame (a)] or µ0Γ1 [frame (b)]
applies to any value of Γ0 or Γ1, respectively. In frame
(a), the dotted green curve is for µ0 = 0. Solid black is for
µ0/Γ0 = 0.5, dashed red corresponds to µ0/Γ0 = 1, and
dash-dotted blue is for µ0/Γ0 = 1.5. We also present the
open-circle curves for when only the Boltzmann term in
Eqn. (5) is used (i.e. the last term which is ∝ 1/Γ0). The
colours are set to match the same µ0/Γ0 values as the full
result. The Boltzmann curves are displaced downward
by a constant value of 3. Note that the conductivity can
decrease with increasing T , reach a minimum, and after
this, start to rise as T 2. The occurrence of a minimum is
entirely due to the temperature dependence of the chem-
ical potential µ(T ) which reﬂects the energy dependence
of the underlying density of states in a DSM which goes
like ω2. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 which shows how µ(T )
is reduced from its T = 0 value of µ0 as the temperature
rises. This behaviour is determined by the conservation

FIG. 2. (Color online) Universal dc conductivity as a function
of T for (a) a constant scattering rate, and (b) short-range
impurities. Various values of µ0 are considered and compared
to the results of the Boltzmann model (open circles) which are
shifted down by three units. The eﬀect of the T dependence
of µ is seen by comparing the dash-dotted blue and dotted
blue (constant µ) curves.

This ensures that the number of dopant charges remains
constant.
If the density of states were constant, there
would be no such shift in µ. There is particle-hole sym-
metry and the thermal factor reduces the occupation be-
low µ in the same proportion as it increases it above µ.
To conserve particles, it is the product of the density of
states times the thermal factor which enters. This is in-

It is important to note
that in this model, the Boltzmann-only solution (black

diﬀerent than the full result.

B. Wiedemann-Franz Law

We now turn to a discussion of the thermal conduc-
tivity (κ), thermopower (S, or Seebeck coeﬃcient) and
Lorenz number [L = κ/(T σdc)]. The necessary Kubo
formulas for S and κ are given in App. B. After some
straightforward algebra, we arrive at the formula for
the Lorenz number. For model I (Γ(ω) = Γ0), we ﬁnd

In both cases, the second term in the bracket of the ex-
pression is S2/L0 (see Appendix B). We have veriﬁed that
when the terms proportional to Γ0 and Γ1 in Eqs. (12)
and (13), respectively, are dropped, these equations re-
duce to the results found in Ref.17 which were based on
a Boltzmann equation approach.

Results for the thermopower are given in Fig. 4(a) and

or µ0Γ1 and the temperature dependence of µ is included
in the calculation. For comparison, we also show the re-

sults when µ is kept temperature independent (dotted
curves). Clearly, the temperature dependence of µ is
essential to obtaining quantitative results. This has a
strong eﬀect on the position and sharpness of the peaks
and particularly on the rapidness with which it decays
for increasing T .

In Fig. 5, we present results for the Wiedemann-Franz
law. The Lorenz number, normalized to L0 is plotted as

FIG. 5. (Color online) Lorenz number as a function of T for
the (a) constant- and (b) weak-scattering models. In all cases,
T = 0 returns the familiar value L0 = π2/(3e2). The large-T
limit is L = 4.2L0. The rise to this limiting value shifts to
higher T for larger µ0. Again, neglecting the T -dependence
of µ has a qualitative eﬀect on the results (dotted curves).

7

Frame (a) displays the results for a constant scattering
rate and frame (b), for weak scattering. In all cases, re-
gardless of the value of µ0 or the type of scattering, L
starts at L0 when T = 0 and rises to a value of 4.2L0
as T increases. It is important to note that the temper-
ature dependence of µ also plays an important role in
determining the rise to 4.2L0. This is seen in Fig. 5 by
comparing the full result to the case when µ(T ) = µ0
(dotted curves). Diﬀerences can be large.

The results in Fig. 5 can be understood by examining
Eqns. (12) and (13). Firstly, at T = 0, the thermopower
correction to the Wiedemann-Franz law (second term)
vanishes and we get

L = L0(cid:26) 3Γ2

3Γ2

0 + µ2

0 + µ2(cid:27) = L0,

for Γ(ω) = Γ0, and

L = L0(cid:26) 3Γ2

3Γ2

1µ2 + 1

1µ2 + 1(cid:27) = L0,

(14)

(15)

for Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2. These reduce to L0 regardless of
the scattering parameter or chemical potential. Further,
when T becomes the dominant scale, the second terms of
Eqns. (12) and (13) can be dropped as they go like 1/T 2
and we are left with

L =

21
5

L0 = 4.2L0

(16)

in both models.

It is also interesting to note that the numerators of
the second terms of Eqns. (12) and (13) have diﬀerent
origins. For model I [Eqn. (12)], it comes entirely from
the Boltzmann contribution. For model II [Eqn. (13)],
it arises due to the correction piece proportional to Γ1
rather than the 1/Γ1 term of Boltzmann theory. The
ﬁrst term in the Lorenz ratio, of course, has contribu-
tions from both as does the dc conductivity denominator
of the second terms in Eqns. (12) and (13).
If we re-
tain only the Boltzmann contribution, we obtain Fig. 6.
Now, Eqn. (13) gives L = L0 for all T (dashed red).
It is clearly the non-Boltzmann piece that provides the
temperature dependence of L for weak scattering. For
constant impurity scattering, the rise to 4.2L0 is seen
even in the Boltzmann approach (solid black). Return-
ing to the long-range Coulomb impurity model, we ﬁnd
that the pure Boltzmann approach gives

FIG. 6.
(Color online) Lorenz number as a function of T
calculated from the Boltzmann equation. Three models are
considered: constant-scattering, weak-scattering, and long-
range Coulomb impurities. As expected, the T = 0 limit is
L0 = π2/(3e2). The large-T limit is diﬀerent for all three
models; it is L = 4.2L0, L0 and 9.49L0, respectively.

The T -dominated limit of Eqn. (17) is particularly inter-
esting. It gives

L = 9.49L0.

(19)

This yields a diﬀerent plateau in the Lorenz ratio. Nu-
merical results are shown in Fig. 6 (dash-dotted blue).
Clearly, in the Boltzmann approach, the three scattering
models give three diﬀerent saturated values at high T .

III. AC CONDUCTIVITY

The general formula for the absorptive part of the dy-
namical conductivity is given in App. A. In particular,
the intra- and interband contributions for any scattering
model are given by Eqns. (A8) and (A9), respectively.
For a constant Γ(ω) = Γ0, we ﬁnd

It is important to connect these results for σIB
xx(Ω) and
σD
xx(Ω) obtained in the clean limit with our previous re-
sults for the dc conductivity of Eqn. (5). In deriving the
interband and intraband contributions to the dynami-
cal conductivity [Eqns. (22) and (23), respectively] we
have kept only the leading term as Γ0 → 0 which goes
like 1/Γ0. Eﬀectively, we have dropped the ﬁrst term in
Eqn. (5) which is 3Γ0σ0 and is only important if both
µ and T are zero. Therefore, only the Boltzmann terms
are retained. Clearly, as Ω → 0, the interband contri-
bution σIB
xx(Ω → 0) = 0 and the intraband component
xx(Ω → 0) = (σ0/Γ0)(µ2 + π2T 2/3) which agrees with
σD
Eqn. (5). Here, we have replaced the Dirac δ-function in
Eqn. (23) by a Lorentzian of width 2Γ0 and taken the dc
limit Ω → 0 before considering the clean limit Γ0 → 0
and retaining only the leading term ∝ 1/Γ0.

(28)

Therefore, in the large T limit, WD(T, µ) will increase as
T 2. The corresponding eﬀect has been noted in experi-
ments on graphene81 where an optical pumping terahertz
technique was used and the optical spectral weight of the
Drude was obtained over a large T interval. They saw
the initial decrease of spectral weight as T is increased
out of T = 0. The expected trend towards linearity in
T for 2D, which is predicted by theory82, was observed.
There is also preliminary data that bares on this issue in
DSMs. Examples include the optical work by Sushkov et
al.69 in the pyrochlore iridates Eu2Ir2O7, Chen et al.68
in ZrTe5 and Xu et al.70 in TaAs.

In Fig. 7, we show results for the interband contri-
bution to the conductivity given by Eqn. (22) at various
temperatures. Frame (a) displays µ0 = 0, while frame (b)
contains results for µ0 = 1 meV. In frame (a), solid black
corresponds to T = 0.01 meV, dashed red to T = 0.1
meV, dash-double-dotted purple to T = 0.25 meV, dash-
dotted blue to T = 1 meV and double-dash-dotted green
to T = 1.5 meV. At low temperature (black curve), we re-
tain the expected linear behaviour since tanh(βΩ/2) → 1
for β → ∞ in Eqn. (22). As T increases, the low Ω re-
gion of the curve is rapidly depleted due to the transfer
of spectral weight from the interband to the intraband.
This is a manifestation of the reduction of interband tran-
sitions due to Pauli blocking in the conduction band and
the reduction in the probability of occupation in the va-
lence band. In addition, the linear behaviour is only re-
covered at values of Ω an order of magnitude greater
than T (see the dash-double-dotted purple curve). For
the two higher T values shown, linearity is not observed
as it occurs for Ω much greater than shown here. A sim-
ilar scenario is seen in frame (b) where µ0 = 1 meV.
Again, several T values are shown: 0.01, 0.1, 1, and
1.5 meV which are coloured the same as in the upper
frame. For low T , the solid black curve displays a clear
cutoﬀ at Ω = 2µ as expected from Eqn. (22) where the
quotient of hyperbolic trigonometric functions reduces to
the Heaviside step function Θ(Ω − 2µ). This sharp rise
is quickly smeared as T increases. Even for T = 1 meV
(dash-dotted blue), the cutoﬀ is indiscernible. The in-
set of Fig. 7(b) shows the clean limit as a function of
Ω/T for various values of µ/T . Clearly, the sharpness of
the step-up increases as µ/T becomes larger. Finally, we
note that the dotted lines in frame (b) correspond to µ
being held temperature independent. The colours are set
to match those of the corresponding T values. This does
not change the main qualitative features.

It is clear from our discussion that the optical spectral
weight under the Drude and in the interband transitions
are both changed with variations in temperature. For
graphene, it was demonstrated by Gusynin et al.82 that
the total spectral weight up to an energy Λ ≫ T is con-
served. We ﬁnd that this is also the case for a 3D DSM as

2 meV does not fall above the point at which the con-
ductivity has returns to its T = 0 value. More optical
spectral weight is lost above this energy as illustrated in
the inset by the shaded region. Thus, to see the sum rule
obeyed at this temperature would require a large Λ. At
T = 0.1 meV, this cutoﬀ is clearly adequate and indeed
the sum rule is seen in the lower frame (dotted red ver-
tical line). In conclusion, if we take a suﬃciently large
cutoﬀ (more than an order of magnitude) compared with
the temperature of interest, we obtain conservation of
optical spectral weight as also found in graphene.

Next, we consider T = 0 but a ﬁnite scattering rate
Γ(ω). Only the case of Γ(ω) = Γ0 is suﬃciently simple
to provide a useful analytic result. In this instance, the
inter- and intraband conductivities are given by

perature, the total spectral weight up to Λ = 2 meV is
completely T independent. Deviations from a constant
set in at T ≈ 0.15 meV. This does not imply that the
conservation law on optical spectral weight holds only at
small T . It means that conservation for larger T requires
a higher Λ. This is graphically seen in Fig. 8(a). Con-

Adding Eqns. (32) and (33) in the limit Ω → 0, returns
the total dc conductivity of Eqn. (5) when T = 0. Re-
sults applicable to the approach to the Dirac point (small
µ) are shown in Fig. 9(a) while large µ is considered in
the inset. In the main frame, the solid black curve gives
µ = 0, the dashed-red shows µ/Γ0 = 2 and dash-dotted
blue displays µ/Γ0 = 3. In all three cases, the associated
colour-coordinated dotted curves give the Drude contri-
bution. These are strikingly diﬀerent from the ordinary
Drude result of metal theory which are described by the
simple Lorentzian form 2Γ0/[(2Γ0)2 + Ω2], where 2Γ0 is
the transport scattering rate. This diﬀerence is expected
from Eqn. (33) where the square brackets contain addi-
tional terms proportional to µ2 and Ω2 as well as the
constant which multiples the Lorentzian. These modiﬁ-
cations imply that the Drude conductivity does not de-
cay like Ω−2 at large Ω but rather saturates at a constant

FIG. 9. (Color online) Optical conductivity for (a) Γ(ω) = Γ0
and (b) Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2.
(a) As µ increases, a larger Drude
response is seen centred about Ω = 0 (dotted curves). At
higher frequency, a linear interband background emerges. In-
set: large-µ limit. A stronger Drude is observed, before a de-
pletion of conductivity prior to a step at Ω = 2µ into a linear
background. (b) In contrast to (a), the interband background
and high-Ω Drude is quadratic due to the energy dependence
of Γ(ω).

For large µ/Γ0, the inset shows an increase in spectral
weight under the Drude which becomes better deﬁned
about Ω = 0. This is followed by a region of low con-
ductivity before a rapid rise occurs at Ω = 2µ associated
with interband transitions. This step sharpens with in-
creasing µ/Γ0, as is clearly seen in the inset for Fig. 9(a)
which has results for µ/Γ0 = 5 (solid black) to µ/Γ0 = 30
(dotted purple) in increments of 5.

It is interesting to closely examine the dc limit and
relate this value to our results given in Eqn. (5). Refer-

11

ring back to Eqns. (A10)-(A12), it can be seen that, in
Eqn. (5), the second term (∝ 1/Γ0), is a Boltzmann-type
term that appears only in the Drude conductivity and is
zero at T = 0 and µ = 0. The ﬁrst term of Eqn. (5)
is the correction provided by the Kubo formula and is
∝ (Γ0 + 2Γ0) where the ﬁrst Γ0 comes from the Drude
piece and 2Γ0 comes from the interband piece. Conse-
quently, upon examining the solid black curve of Fig. 9(a)
in the limit Ω → 0, one sees that it is three times the
corresponding Drude value (dotted black). When µ 6= 0,
the Boltzmann term makes an additional contribution of
1/(12π2)(µ/Γ0)2 in the units used here.

For the weak-scattering model where Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2,
similar results are presented in Fig. 9(b). These were ob-
tained numerically from the more complicated equations
which take full account of the energy dependence of the
impurity scattering [Eqns. (A8) and (A9)]. The format is
the same as Fig. 9(a). In the main frame, we show results
for the real part of the dynamical conductivity which are
normalized to be independent of Γ1. Three values of µΓ1
are plotted: 0 (solid black), 0.5 (dashed red) and 1 (dash-
dotted blue). Again, the Drude contribution is given by
the colour-coordinated dotted lines. For µ = 0, no Drude
peak is seen at Ω = 0 but there is still an intraband con-
tribution (dotted black) which starts from zero at Ω = 0
and rises with increasing Ω. This behaviour is traced
to the vanishing of the scattering rate at ω = 0 and its
quadratic growth in ω (Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2). For ﬁnite µ, there
is a Drude peak centred at Ω = 0 but the intraband
conductivity eventually ﬂattens out before it begins to
increase in a quasilinear fashion. The total conductivity
shows a Drude-like peak as Ω → 0 which is followed by
a region which is nearly linear in Ω.

It is important to note that in frame (a), µ/Γ0 is used
while the scaling in (b) is µΓ1. In terms of the scatter-
ing rate at the chemical potential, µ/Γ0 = µ/Γ(µ) while
µΓ1 = Γ(µ)/µ. Thus, in the upper frame, the Boltzmann
regime of µ ≫ Γ(µ) corresponds to large values of µ/Γ0
while in the lower frame, it is associated with small val-
ues of µΓ1. This is shown in the inset of Fig. 9(b) for four
values of µΓ1: 0.001 (solid black), 0.005 (dashed red), 0.1
(dash-dotted blue), and 0.15 (double-dash-dotted green).
The x-axis is ΩΓ1; thus, the expected jump at Ω = 2µ
corresponds to 2µΓ1 on this axis. Therefore, the solid
black curve jumps at 0.02, while the double-dash-dotted
green curve steps up at 0.3. The jump is sharper for
µΓ1 = 0.001 than 0.15 as the scattering rate has increased
from Γ(µ)/µ = 0.01 to 0.15.

Figure 10 emphasizes another important point about
the behaviour of the conductivity when the Drude and
interband regions are clearly separated with a region of
low conductivity between them. Frame (a) shows the
short-range impurity scattering model, while long-range
Coulomb scattering is used in (b). In both frames, µ is
set at 0.5 meV and we, thus, expect a jump at Ω = 1 meV
except for the solid black curve in frame (a) which has
no charge doping (µ = 0) and is for comparison. We take
Γ1 = 0.1 meV−1 [frame (a)] and Γ2 = 0.1 [frame (b)] for

the solid black and dashed red curves. The dash-dotted
blue curve corresponds to Γ1 = 0.01 meV−1 [frame (a)]
and Γ2 = 0.1 [frame (b)].
In both models, the jump
at Ω = 2µ = 1 meV is sharpest in the dash-dotted blue
curve which is purer. More prominent structures are seen
in the gap of the long-range Coulomb conductivity as
compared to model II. This is expected since the optical
conductivity involves a product of the density of states
factor ω2 and the scattering rate Γ(ω + Ω) which is very
diﬀerent in these two cases. More precisely, the factor
Γ(ω)(ω + Ω)2 + Γ(ω + Ω)ω2, is equal to Γ1(ω2(ω + Ω)2 +
(ω + Ω)2ω2) for Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2. For Γ(ω) = Γ2µ3/ω2, it is
the more complicated Γ2µ3[(ω + Ω)2/ω2 + ω2/(ω + Ω)2]
which introduces signiﬁcant structure in the Fig. 10(b).

12

We see in the colour-coordinated dotted curves for the
Drude contribution alone that impurity structures are
present in the intraband absorption processes as well.
These are traced to the energy dependence of the scatter-
ing rate. Finally, in the region of photon energy shown,
when the scattering rate increases with ω [Γ(ω) = Γ1ω2],
the cleaner sample has a conductivity that is above the
dirtier system in the quasilinear region while it is the op-
posite when the scattering rate decreases with increasing
ω (Γ(ω) = Γ2µ3/ω2).

IV. WEYL SEMIMETALS

So far, we have restricted our attention to a single
Dirac cone. This eﬀectively describes DSMs which are
inversion- and time-reversal-symmetric. Here a simple
degeneracy factor can be included in the formulas to ac-
count for the number of cones (for example, spin and val-
ley degeneracy). If either symmetry is broken, a WSM
is obtained21. This leads to a pair of Weyl nodes which
have opposite chirality (χ = ±) and are described by the
low-energy Hamiltonian83,84

ˆH = χ(¯hvF σ · (q − χQ) + IQ0),

(35)

where σ is a 3D vector of Pauli matrices and I is the
identity matrix. When Q = 0 and Q0 = 0, this is simply
the single-cone Hamiltonian for DSMs which has been
used throughout this paper. A ﬁnite Q corresponds to
broken time-reversal symmetry while a nonzero Q0 re-
sults from broken inversion symmetry. For Q 6= 0 and
Q0 = 0, the two Weyl nodes have the same energy but
are separated in momentum space (see upper-left inset of
Fig. 11); while, for ﬁnite Q0 and zero Q, the two nodes sit
at the same momentum with one shifted up in energy by
Q0 and the other down by the same amount (lower-right
inset of Fig. 11).

We can generalize our results to systems described by
Eqn. (35) by deﬁning k = χq − Q, which eﬀectively elim-
inates Q. The conductivity of a single Weyl node of
chirality χ is then given by Eqn. (A4) with the substi-
tution µ → µ − χQ0 in the Fermi functions. Therefore,
all the results presented thus far for a single Dirac cone
account for broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry
by summing up the single-node results with µ → µ − Q0
and µ → µ + Q0. It is immediately clear that the opti-
cal and dc transport properties are unaﬀected by broken
time-reversal symmetry in zero external magnetic ﬁeld.
It should be noted that a shift by a ﬁnite Q could in
principle modify the impurity scattering itself, an eﬀect
that we have not accounted for in this work. For noncen-
trosymmetric WSMs (ﬁnite Q0), two steps will be seen
in the optical conductivity, one at Ω = |2µ − 2Q0| and
the other at |2µ + 2Q0|. For T = 0, Γ = 0,

This is written here for only one pair of Weyl nodes. To
include more, one multiplies this result by the number of
Weyl pairs. A schematic plot of the interband conduc-
tivity is given in Fig. 11.

In the model Hamiltonian of Eqn. (35), time-reversal
symmetry is broken but no external magnetic ﬁeld is in-
volved. The application of a magnetic ﬁeld (B) not di-
rectly perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld can pump charge
from one Weyl node to the other, an eﬀect known as the
chiral anomaly, which we do not consider here. The ef-
fect of such charge pumping on the optical conductivity
of a WSM has been presented in Ref.67, where a two-step
conductivity is also predicted for ﬁnite B. Our results in
Fig. 11, pertain to B = 0.

should also display diﬀerences between
the noncentrosymmetric WSM and the time-reversal
symmetry breaking WSM in a like manner to Fig. 11 and
Eqns. (36) and (37). That is, the noncentrosymmetric
WSM will be a superposition of two versions of the DSM
results from previous sections, one for µ+ and one for
µ−. Speciﬁcally, consider the dc limit of the conductivity
given in Eqn. (3) at T = 0. Its generalization to ﬁnite

as insets.

A number of remarkable features result for the case of
the noncentrosymmetric WSM. First, the Drude conduc-
tivity is always ﬁnite. Even at µ = 0 (charge neutrality)
the Drude weight is given by 2σ0Q2
0. Secondly, for ﬁ-
nite µ, the linear frequency background at higher energy
(above the second step in absorption) should have a slope
of twice that of the linear background arising out of the
ﬁrst step. Finally, at µ = 0, the 3D DSM and the WSM
with ﬁnite Q will display a single linear background all
the way to low frequency passing through the origin. For
the noncentrosymmetric case with µ = 0, the conductiv-
ity will show zero interband absorption below Ω = 2|Q0|
and a single step at Ω = 2|Q0| to a linear background.
Clearly, the signature of the noncentrosymmetric WSM
will be quite diﬀerent from the others. While diﬀerent
in the details, a similar type of behaviour has been dis-
cussed for the dynamical conductivity of AA-stacked bi-
layer graphene85 which shows energy-shifted Dirac cones.

which increases as the square of Q0/Γ0. Previously, we
saw that the chemical potential drops out of the Lorenz
number [see Eqn. (14)] so L will remain unchanged by a
shifting of the Dirac cones by ±Q0 in energy. At ﬁnite
temperature, a correction can arise. As another example,
the thermopower [Eqn. (B11)] will not change at charge
neutrality as the particle and hole contributions will can-
cel.

INCLUDING A MASSLESS GAP

The optical conductivity data of Chen et al.68 on the
semimetal ZrTe5 shows that the dynamical conductiv-
ity is nearly linear in photon energy over a range of 150
meV. In addition, it extrapolates to a small but ﬁnite
intercept on the Reσxx(Ω) axis at T = 8 K. This was
taken as a sign of Dirac semimetallic behaviour. A simi-
lar result was found in pyrochlore Eu2Ir2O7 by Sushkov
et al.69; although, in this case, the range over which the
conductivity displays linearity is only ∼ 10 meV. Here,
the linear data extrapolates to ∼ 0 as the photon energy

tends to zero. In the work of Timusk et al.30, data on
the optical conductivity of several quasicrystals showed
linearity over a much larger energy range of ∼ 600 − 1000
meV. For Al63.5Cu24.5Fe12 and Al75.5Mn20.5Si10.1, the
data also extrapolates to ﬁnite intercept as Ω → 0. For
Al70Pd20Re10, the extrapolated conductivity crosses the
Ω axis at ∼ 200 meV. For Al2Ru, these authors present
curves which show two separate regions of linear be-
haviour; one extrapolates to zero at ∼ 620 meV while
the other crosses the energy axis at ∼ 50 meV. Recently,
Xu et al.70 measured the optical response of the WSM
TaAs and found a linear dependence below ∼ 30 meV
(which extrapolates to zero) followed by a Drude below
∼ 10 meV. They also found a second linear region be-
tween ∼ 30 meV and 125 meV with a much reduced slope
(factor of ∼ 14) as compared with the ﬁrst such region.
This line extrapolates to a ﬁnite vertical intercept. There
is also an experiment31 on 3D zinc-blende Hg1−xCdxTe
where a linear interband conductivity is seen in zero mag-
netic ﬁeld, from ∼ 50 − 350 meV and extrapolates to cut
the Ω-axis at positive photon energy. This material has
been described as a system with massless fermions with
a low-energy bandstructure which has Dirac cones and a
ﬂat band at the Dirac point. Contributions to the inter-
band conductivity arise from both transitions from the
ﬂat band to the Dirac cone and between the cones31,86,
analogous to what is studied here, and theory predicts a
linear conductivity31,87. This system can be understood
as a superposition between a pseudospin 1/2 and pseu-
dospin 1 3D DSM86,88 and, hence, it ﬁts with our discus-
sion. Overall, it is clear that the optical conductivity of a
number of materials has been measured and the unusual
linear conductivity suggesting 3D Dirac cones has been
seen although some details diﬀer.

In the simplest theory of a DSM presented so far, the
extrapolation of the linear interband background goes
through zero (in the clean limit) as it is simply propor-
tional to Ω. This observation poses an important ques-
tion: how can our model be modiﬁed to give a ﬁnite Ω
intercept as seen in a number of experiments? The intro-
duction of a Dirac mass ∆ into the electronic dispersions

to get ǫk = ±p∆2 + (¯hvF k)2 does not provide such a

shift but rather, at zero temperature, introduces a cut
oﬀ in Eq. (21) for the interband optical conductivity of
2∆. The extrapolation of σIB
θ(Ω − 2∆)Ω
to Ω = 0 still goes through the origin. However, as was
already noted by Timusk et al.30, σIB
xx (Ω) can cut the hor-
izontal axis at ﬁnite photon frequency if the two Dirac
cones are pushed up and down by a gap ∆ as illustrated
by the inset in Fig. 12. Such a band structure, which goes
beyond a standard Dirac fermion model, leads naturally
to an interband optical characteristic which goes through
zero at ﬁnite photon energy Ω, while massive Dirac cones
do not. A similar model was introduced and studied in
relation to 2D systems (namely graphene) in the work of
Benfatto et al.71,72. In their work, the energy of the Dirac
quasiparticles is modiﬁed from the usual εk = ±¯hvF k to
±(¯hvF k + ∆). The authors argue that the origin of ∆

We can also infer from Fig. 12, that at ﬁnite T <

tle eﬀect on the interband conductivity while it intro-
duces a Drude. Finally, the double-dash-dotted green

broadening which ﬁlls in the region below the optical gap

In Fig. 12, we provide numerical results for µ = 0 which
conﬁrm our analytic formulas derived in the clean limit.
For this ﬁgure, however, we return to Eqn. (A4) and
include a gap in the dispersion curves through the sub-
stitution shown in Eqn. (A14). The clean limit is not
taken so that both contributions from the Γ0 and 1/Γ0
terms are retained. We have included a small constant
residual scattering rate Γ(ω) = Γ0 = 0.01 meV, and used
∆ = 1 meV so that the optical gap is Ωc = 2 meV.
Two values of temperature are considered: T = 0 (solid
black) and T = 0.5 meV (dashed red). We also show
T = 0 for Γ0 = 0.1 meV (double-dash-dotted green). For
T = 0, the solid black curve onsets at 2 meV and then
rises according to Eqn. (46) before displaying quasilinear
behaviour which we have indicated by a dotted line and
labelled linear extrapolation. This line extrapolates to
Ω ∼ 2.8 meV. It should be noted that this is not the
linear behaviour expected as Ω → ∞. In that limit, the
factor (Ω − Ωc)2/Ω of Eqn. (46) goes like Ω − 2Ωc + Ω2
c/Ω
which is approximately Ω − 2Ωc. This would display an
Ω intercept of 2Ωc = 4 meV in our example. However,
in the range of frequency shown here, the quasilinear de-
pendence extrapolates to a lower value ∼ 2.8 meV. Our
results agree well with the experimental data of Timusk
et al.30 on the quasicrystal Al2Ru (higher energy com-
ponent) with an optical gap of ≈ 600 meV and with
Al70Pd20Re10 where Ωc ≈ 200 meV. Comparison with
the data of Sushkov et al.69 on pyrochlore Eu2Ir2O7 in-
dicates a negligible gap. Comparison with Chen et al.68
on the semimetal ZrTe5 indicates a small negative gap.
Conversely, Xu et al.70 suggest that the second linear re-
gion observed in the conductivity of TaAs (which does
not extrapolate to zero) can be understood as having a
signiﬁcant component coming from trivial bands rather
than Weyl points.

In this manuscript, we calculate the dc conductivity
about a single Dirac or Weyl node within the Kubo for-
mulation. Particular attention is paid to the approach
towards charge neutrality, either at zero temperature in
the limit of small chemical potential (µ → 0), or at µ = 0
for T → 0. Three models for the residual (impurity) scat-
tering rate are considered. Namely, a constant (model I),
weak scattering in the Born approximation which gives a
scattering rate Γ(ω) proportional to the density of states
N (ω) ∝ ω2 (model II), and long-range Coulomb charged
impurities with the number of scattering centres equal
to the hole dopping (model III). These model were con-
sidered in the work of Lundgren et al.17 on dc transport
in Weyl and Dirac semimetals with which we wish to
compare. These authors used the Boltzmann equation
formulation while we proceed from the Kubo formula.
This provides a correction term which can be of signiﬁ-
cant importance particularly when µ is not much greater
than the residual scattering rate or temperature.

The dc conductivity at µ = T = 0 [σdc(µ = 0, T = 0)]
depends on the scattering model employed and is not
universal (independent of the scattering rate) as it is
in graphene. For example, in model I, it is given by

3 π2T 2(cid:1)(cid:3) where Γ0 is

σdc(µ, T ) = σ0(cid:2)3Γ0 + (1/Γ0)(cid:0)µ2 + 1

the constant scattering rate. Therefore, σdc(µ = 0, T =
0) = 3Γ0σ0 with σ0 = e2/(12π2¯h3vF ). This linearly de-
pends on Γ0. In the Boltzmann approach, the term linear
in Γ0 is not there and thus σdc(µ = 0, T = 0) = 0 instead.
We also note that in the approach to (µ, T ) = (0, 0), the
value of σdc is quadratic in µ and T for both formulations.
This is not the case in model II. The Kubo formula pre-
dicts the same quadratic dependence on µ and T while
the Boltzmann equation gives a constant conductivity
with no dependence on µ or T .

When considering the temperature dependence of the
dc conductivity, we ﬁnd it important to account for the
T dependence of the chemical potential. This arises from
the energy dependence of the density of states which is
quadratic in ω. These eﬀects are also important for other
transport coeﬃcients, such as the thermal conductivity,
thermopower (Seebeck coeﬃcient) and Lorenz number
(Wiedemann-Franz law). A minimum is obtained in σdc
as a function of T which is traced to the T dependence
of µ. The predicted thermopower shows a much sharper
peak at low T and decays much more rapidly as temper-
ature increases when this dependence is included in µ. It
also leads to a faster rise in the Lorenz number (L) with

T . For all three scattering models, the Wiedemann-Franz

law is obeyed at T = 0 (i.e. L0 = π2k2
is the Boltzmann constant and e the electron charge). It
rises with T and comes to a high temperature plateau
which is L = 4.2L0 for models I and II and is L = 9.49L0
for the Coulomb scattering model III. This oﬀers the pos-
sibility of diﬀerentiating between the models. In this re-
gard, we have also found that, for weak scattering (model
II), the Boltzmann and Kubo approaches predict a quite
diﬀerent high temperature saturated value. It is 4.2L0 in
our work whereas keeping only the Boltzmann-like term
gives L0 (i.e. there is no T dependence of L).

For the constant scattering rate model, we ﬁnd it pos-
sible and instructive to derive simple analytic formulas
for the ac conductivity in the clean limit (Γ0 → 0). The
interband transitions at T = 0 provide a linear-in-Ω back-
ground which extrapolates to zero as Ω → 0. However,
the interband response is cut oﬀ below Ω = 2µ. As T
increases, for µ = 0, the interband background depletes
at small Ω over a range of photon energies of order >
∼ 10
times the temperature. For ﬁnite µ, the jump at Ω = 2µ
becomes smeared and for T of order µ, no identiﬁable sig-
nature of a sharp step remains. As the interband back-
ground becomes depleted by increasing temperature, the
Drude contribution is increased and we ﬁnd a sum rule
on the optical spectral weight. Speciﬁcally, the optical
spectral weight in the Drude increases as the square of
the chemical potential (i.e. ∝ µ(T )2) as well as with the
square of temperature (∼ (π2/3)T 2).
In general, µ(T )
decreases with increasing T and, in some circumstances,
this can decrease the Drude spectral weight by more than
the increase from the (π2/3)T 2 term. This leads to a net
decreases from its T = 0 value. At higher T , the Drude
weight always equals σ0π2T 2/3.

For model I, it is also possible to obtain a simple ex-
pression for the ac conductivity at T = 0 for any value of
Γ0. The Drude conductivity is found to be a Lorentzian
with an optical scattering width of 2Γ0 which is multi-
plied by the sum of three terms. The ﬁrst gives the usual
Drude Lorentzian of metal theory. The second is pro-
portional to (µ/Γ0)2 which does not modify the form of
the Lorentzian as a function of Ω but simply changes the
spectral weight. The ﬁnal term goes like [Ω/(2Γ0)]2 and
this does modify the shape of the Lorentzian. In fact, for
Ω → ∞, it no longer goes to zero but rather becomes a
constant equal to 4Γ0σ0/3. As with ﬁnite T , including
a nonzero Γ0 smears out the interband jump at Ω = 2µ
expected in the clean limit. It also adds spectral weight
in the interband transitions below 2µ and depletes the re-
gion above. For small µ/Γ0, the Drude and interband re-
gions overlap signiﬁcantly. The distinction between them
becomes clearer as µ/Γ0 increases. This is also the case
for model II; however, no simple analytic expressions ex-
ist and so we must proceed numerically. For long-range
Coulomb scattering, we ﬁnd distinct structures appear in
σxx(Ω) due to the complex variation of Γ(ω) vs. ω. This
could provide information on such complicated scattering
models.

16

In the clean limit, an isolated Dirac or Weyl node leads
to an interband background which is linear in Ω and ex-
trapolates to the origin as Ω → 0. Many experiments on
Dirac and Weyl materials as well as quasicrystals have
found linear interband regions which are taken as signa-
tures of Dirac physics. However, the data often does not
extrapolate to zero as Ω → 0. Instead, it can cross the y
axis with a positive intercept, or it can cut the photon-
energy axis at Ω > 0. While we have seen that impurity
scattering can modify the linear background and provide
a positive intercept on the vertical axis, the observation
of linear experimental data that intercepts the photon-
energy axis at Ω > 0 cannot easily be explained. With
this in view, we have also studied a model where a mass-
less gap is included which could provide a more robust
explanation of some of the available data.
In 2D, an
analogous model was used by Benfatto et al.71,72 to ex-
plain the optical data in graphene obtained by Dawlaty
et al.73. In this model, the conduction-band Dirac cone
is shifted vertically upward by a gap ∆ while the valence
cone is shifted downward by the same amount. More
recently, Morimoto et al.74 have studied the Mott-Weyl
insulator in which the valence and conduction bands are
displaced from each other by a vertical gap due to the
correlations with the Hubbard U which provides the gap.
Consequently, we have generalized our work to include
such a gap. The energy spectrum is thus replaced by
εk = ±(¯hvF k + ∆) as opposed to the usual εk = ±¯hvF k
dispersion of a 3D Dirac material. At zero temperature,
the Ω dependence of the interband conductivity calcu-
lated in the clean limit is modiﬁed to ∼ (Ω − 2∆)2/Ω.
When the optical gap Ωc ≡ 2∆ is set to zero, we retain
our previous result. This model has a built in displace-
ment of Ωc along the photon-energy axis and is quasilin-
ear at small Ω before becoming linear when Ω ≫ Ωc.

Finally, we have discussed predicted diﬀerences be-
tween the two types of WSMs:
those due to time-
reversal symmetry breaking which separates the Dirac
cones in momentum versus noncentrosymmetric WSMs
which have Dirac cones at the same position in momen-
tum but shifted in energy relative to each other. For
the former case, the results discussed here will be indis-
tinguishable from the 3D DSM situation. However, for
the latter system, we predict two steps in the B = 0
absorptive dynamical conductivity at ﬁnite charge dop-
ing, each followed by a linearly increasing background
with a slope ratio between them of two (for simple Dirac
cones). Unlike the previous cases, there will be a Drude
absorption at all dopings, even at charge neutrality where
µ = 0. Moreover, at µ = 0, there will still be one step
in the interband background. This result is understood
as a superposition of two Dirac cones, each with a diﬀer-
ent doping µ±. Other properties discussed here (such as
the Seebeck coeﬃcient, thermal conductivity and Lorenz
number) can also show diﬀerences for this type of WSM
via the signature of the displacement in energy of the
split cones.

The study of the transport and optical properties of

Dirac-Weyl semimetals is still in its infancy and system-
atic data involving samples with well-characterized and
controlled defects is largely still lacking. Our calculations
serve to illustrate that the temperature and chemical po-
tential variation of the DC transport coeﬃcients can pro-
vide information on aspects of the possible microscopic
residual scattering models. Studies of the intraband and
interband AC conductivity can provide additional infor-
mation.
