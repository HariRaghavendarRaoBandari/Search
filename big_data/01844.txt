Stability assessment methods for dynamical systems have recently been complemented by basin
stability and derived measures, i.e. probabilistic statements whether systems remain in a basin
of attraction given a distribution of perturbations. This requires numerical estimation via Monte-
Carlo sampling and integration of diﬀerential equations. Here, we analyze the applicability of basin
stability to systems with basin geometries challenging for this numerical method, having fractal
basin boundaries and riddled or intermingled basins of attraction. We ﬁnd that numerical basin
stability estimation is still meaningful for fractal boundaries but reaches its limits for riddled basins
with holes.

Going back to the path-breaking ideas of Aleksandr
M. Lyapunov, dynamical systems are said to be stable
if small variations of the initial conditions lead to small
reactions of a system, i.e.
small perturbations cannot
substantially alter the system’s state. This is commonly
a statement about the asymptotic behaviour, allowing
for large transient deviations if only the system eventu-
ally returns to the initial state. Multistable systems with
several attractors add another subtlety to the problem:
perturbations may lead to switching from one attractor
to another, substantially altering asymptotic behaviour
[1]. While inﬁnitesimal perturbations on an attractor
have local eﬀects well-studied in the theory of asymp-
totic stability, ﬁnite (including large) perturbations can
be critical by causing non-local eﬀects like the transition
to another attractor.

A direct stability method are Lyapunov functions [2–
4], which decrease along trajectories and have local min-
ima on attractors. Finding Lyapunov functions is, how-
ever, diﬃcult in high-dimensional multi-stable systems,
although there are recent approaches to determine them
from radial basis functions (e.g. [5]).

Here, we pursue an alternative approach to consider
non-local perturbations termed basin stability SB. The
central idea [6, 7] is to use a kind of volume of the basin
of attraction to quantify the stability of attractors in
multi-stable systems subject to a given distribution of
perturbations. An advantage of this measure is that it
can be eﬃciently estimated even in high-dimensional sys-
tems and as an intuitive interpretation as a probability
to return to an attractor, but it relies on the correct iden-
tiﬁcation of the asymptotic behaviour for a Monte Carlo
sample of initial conditions. Basin stability and derived
concepts have been successfully applied recently [8], e.g.
for power grids [7, 9–11], chimera states [12], explosive
synchronization [13] delayed dynamics [14] and resilience

measures [15].

In numerical simulations, it can be diﬃcult to correctly
identify the asymptotic behaviour and determine the at-
tractors. The basin of attraction can practically be de-
ﬁned as the set of all states that enter and stay in some
trapping region [16]. Problems may arise if transients
are long and chaotic or trajectories stay close to basin
boundaries for long, so that numerical errors can move
the simulated trajectory across a boundary into a wrong
basin and make the simulation converge to a wrong at-
tractor. Principally, three aspects contribute to the over-
all estimation error: the standard error due to sampling
initial conditions, approximation errors in function evalu-
ations or integration of diﬀerential equations, and round-
ing errors due to limited precision. While sampling and
approximation errors are controlled by increasing sample
size and order of approximating polynomials and by de-
creasing step size, rounding errors are typically hard to
reduce, which is not a problem if they are much smaller.
Our study thus focuses on the critical case of systems
where rounding errors cannot be neglected and may even
dominate the overall error due to an intricate state space
geometry highly sensitive to numerical imprecisions. We
put basin stability estimation here to the test by applying
it to systems with fractal basin boundaries and riddled
or intermingled basins of attraction.

Consider a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

˙x = F(x, t)

(1)

that has more than one attractor in its state space X.
Here, we deﬁne an attractor as a minimal compact in-
variant set A ⊆ X whose basin of attraction has positive
Lebesgue measure [17]. The basin of attraction of A is
the set B(A) ⊆ X of all states from which the system
converges to A.

Assume the system moves on an attractor A, yet at
t = 0 a random and not necessarily small perturbation
pushes the system to a state x(0) outside A. Assume
that x(0) is drawn from a probability distribution with
measure µ on X that encodes our knowledge about what
relevant perturbations are how likely to occur. E.g., µ
may be a uniform distribution on some bounded region
R ⊃ A.

Will the system converge back to A after the perturba-
tion? To address this, we study the probability mass of
B,

Z

SB (A) := µ (B (A)) =

1B(A) dµ ∈ [0; 1],

(2)

R

the probability that the system will return to A. The
indicator function 1B(A) (x) yields 1 if x ∈ B (A) and
0 otherwise. We use SB (A) to quantify just how sta-
ble the attractor A is against non-inﬁnitesimal perturba-
tions, and call it the basin stability of A [6, 7].

The estimation of volume integrals such as Eq. 2 in high
dimensions is a well-known problem, and we assume this
is done by simple Monte-Carlo sampling [18, 19]. If for
each initial state x(0), one can numerically integrate the
system x(t) with suﬃcient precision to decide to which
attractor it converges or whether it diverges, the SB es-
timation procedure is thus:

1. Draw a sample of N > 0 independent initial states

from the distribution µ.

2. For each, numerically integrate the system until it

is clear whether and where it converges.

3. Count the number M of times the system has con-

verged to A.

4. Use the estimate ˆSB = M
N .

Since this is an N-times repeated Bernoulli experi-
ment with success probability SB, the absolute stan-
dard error of the estimate ˆSB due to sampling is

pSB (A) (1 − SB (A))/N, independently of the system’s

dimension. Thus, the procedure can be applied to high-
dimensional systems without necessarily increasing the
sample size N, although it may take longer to assess con-
vergence. This is of course since we are not interested in
the basin of attraction’s geometry but only in its volume
w.r.t. the measure µ.
Note that when the relative std. err. of ˆSB is more rele-
vant than the absolute std. err., smaller values of SB (A)
require larger sample sizes, of the order N ∼ 1/SB (A),
However, even if SB (A) is not small, the geometries of
the multiple basins of attraction may still make the esti-
mation of SB diﬃcult for another reason: For some ini-
tial conditions x(0), it may be quite diﬃcult to decide
where x(t) converges to, since the trajectory may start

since for small SB (A), the rel. std. err. is ∼ 1/pN SB (A).

or come quite close to the boundary between the diﬀer-
ent basins, so that approximation and rounding errors
(rather than sampling errors) in the integration may be-
come relevant and may make the simulated trajectory
hop across a basin border, leading to a wrong assessment
of where x(t) actually converges to.

Particularly, this is probable if the basins have fractal
boundaries, where the nature of the basin boundaries in-
ﬂuences the predictability of a system’s behaviour in the
long run [16, 20, 21]. Imagine we randomly draw initial
states from a box through which the boundary between
the basins of two attractors runs. Suppose each initial
state is speciﬁed up to a certain numerical error ε. Then
for an initial state that is closer to the boundary than
ε, it is uncertain to which of the two attractors the sys-
tem will converge. Denote by f(ε) the fraction of initial
states for which the outcome is uncertain, i.e. the un-
certainty fraction [22, 23]. If the boundary is a smooth
curve, then f(ε) is just proportional to ε. However, if
the boundary is fractal, then f(ε) ∝ εα. If α < 1, the
system exhibits ﬁnal state sensitivity, i.e., to decrease
the uncertainty one needs a substantial improvement in
the knowledge of initial conditions. In a way, this power
law scaling leads to an obstruction of predictability [22]
very similar to the sensitive dependence on initial con-
ditions in chaotic systems. It has been found to occur
in Rayleigh-B´enard convection, e.g. numerically [24] and
experimentally [25].

Predicting the long-term behaviour – the essence of
estimating SB (A) – of systems with fractal basin bound-
aries may be hard [21] although generally, for most initial
conditions, the ﬁnal state sensitivity is much smaller than
the unpredictability of the actual trajectory.
So let us ﬁrst investigate how fractal basin boundaries
impact the accuracy of ˆSB by studying the Wada pendu-
lum [26, 27]. Consider a damped, driven pendulum that
is subject to a time-dependent forcing:

˙φ = ω,

˙ω = X cos t − αω − K sin φ .

(3)
For α = 0.1, K = 1 and X = 7/4, this system has
several attractors [28]. The four dominant of them, all
limit cycles with period 2π, are shown in Fig. 1a: The
black and red attractors correspond to rotations of the
pendulum, and the orange and yellow attractors are li-
brations. Their respective basins of attraction at t = 0
are shown in Fig. 1b. Certain regions in this ﬁgure appear
sprinkled with dots belonging to the diﬀerent basins, i.e.
the boundary between the basins is not easily discernible
and remains so when zooming in (Fig. 1c). It is a fractal,
resulting from the so-called Wada property of the basins.
Three (or more) subsets of a space are said to have
the Wada property if any point on the boundary of one
subset is also on the boundary of the two others [16, 28].
For the pendulum, the black basin, the red basin and
the union of the orange and yellow basins have the Wada

property [16, 28]. This means that starting within the
rounding error ε of the boundary, a trajectory could in
principle converge to any of the four attractors.

To verify this empirically, we write ε = 10−p with p
denoting precision, and discard all information after the
p-th signiﬁcant decimal digit in the ﬂoating point vari-
ables used in all individual operations of the numerical
integration. We use 64 bit double precision to allow for
a maximum of p = 16, while using untruncated 32 bit
single precision would correspond to p ≈ 7. For dif-
ferent values of p, we integrate a ﬁxed set of 50 initial
states x(0), drawn uniformly at random from the rectan-
gle R = [−π, π] × [−2, 4].

Fig. 2a, reveals that some initial states, particularly
those indicated by arrows, indeed lead to diﬀerent out-
comes for diﬀerent values of p. To investigate how ˆSB
depends on p, we let µ be the uniform distribution on
R yielding a sample of N = 1, 000 random initial states
which are integrated with diﬀerent precisions p, leading
to estimates ˆSB(p). As depicted in Fig. 2b, there seems
to be no systematic inﬂuence of p on ˆSB(p). Indeed, most
of the individual values of ˆSB(p) are within one standard

error of the most precise value ˆSB(16). This suggests
that, in contrast to long-term prediction for individual
initial states (cf. Fig. 2a), ˆSB is robust under variation of
p.

Another extreme case are attractors whose basins are
not open as for most systems [17] but rather have an
empty interior. The complement of such a riddled basin
intersects every disk in a set of positive measure [29–
32]. This means that all points in its basin of attraction
have pieces of another attractor basin arbitrarily closely
nearby [30].

Physical systems exhibiting riddled basins are the
damped, periodically-driven particle moving in a special
potential [33] or coupled time-delayed systems [34–36].
There are also experimental observations for laser-cooled
ions in a Paul trap [37] indicating a riddled phase space
structure.

In the following, we investigate the impact of riddled
basins of attraction on ˆSB using a conceptual example
[29, 38], i.e. the following quadratic map on the complex
plane:

of Wada boundaries, slight variations of initial conditions
or numerical imprecisions will aﬀect any forecast of the
system’s long-term behaviour.

Again, we investigate the eﬀect of limited numeri-
cal precision on the signiﬁcance of ˆSB.
In Fig. 4a we
depict the result of estimating SB for varying p using
R = [−1.8, 2.4] × [−2.4, 1.8], i.e. the region pictured in
Fig. 3a. We observe a large variation of ˆSB of up to 50%
compared to the most precise estimation ˆSB(16) and no
systematic dependence on p.

In Fig. 3c we zoomed into the neighbourhood of the
red attractor, where the share of the corresponding red
basin is increasing in proximity of the attractor. In par-
ticular, the measure of this basin of attraction, restricted
to an -neighbourhood of the attractor, approaches unit
probability for  → 0 [29]. This apparent behaviour pro-
vides an explanation for Fig. 4c where we determined
ˆSB(p) for Fig. 3c. In contrast to our previous observa-
tion, the ﬂuctuations of ˆSB(p) almost stay within one
standard error and the estimation appears to be more
robust. For reference, Fig. 4b depicts ˆSB(p) for Fig. 3b
not containing any (part of) an attractor. On the one
hand, the variation of ˆSB(p) exceeds one standard error,

This map has three diﬀerent attractors on the complex
plane which are shown in Fig. 3; for simplicity they are
referred to as the red/blue/purple attractors with their
respective basin of attraction in the following. Interest-
ingly, the three basins of attraction are not just riddled,
they are intermingled. A basin of attraction is called in-
termingled if any open set which intersects one basin in
a set of positive measure also intersects each of the other
basins in a set of positive measure [39, 40].

The fact that there is a positive probability to end up in
a diﬀerent attractor around each initial condition inside
a riddled/intermingled basin of attraction renders these
systems eﬀectively non-deterministic [33]. As in the case

mation is more sensitive to numerical imprecisions than
in Fig. 4b; on the other hand the variations are smaller
than in our ﬁrst experiment.

In conclusion, we applied the Monte-Carlo estimation
procedure of basin stability in two cases, i.e. basins with
fractal boundaries and riddled/intermingled basins of at-
traction.
In the former case, we ﬁnd that while the
asymptotic properties of individual trajectories still can-
not be determined robustly, the converse is true for the
basin stability estimation. It remains an open question
for future research, how exactly (in a quantitative sense)
the numerical estimation uncertainty might be derived
from the actual basin geometry. In the latter case, how-
ever, we ﬁnd that the results can vary drastically with
the chosen precision. The eﬀect of rounding errors is
comparable or even larger than the standard error of the
sampling. Only if the sample region R is chosen in some
sense ”close enough” to the actual attractor of interest,
the foliated structure of the surrounding basins allows for
a meaningful numerical estimation.

What are practical implications for the application of
In general, it is suﬃcient if the round-

ing error of an estimation is smaller than its sampling
error to get a signiﬁcant result. However, any numerical
procedure is subject to a ﬁnite numerical precision and
we have to assume that in practice it will not be high
enough to reach this goal in dynamical systems with in-
tricate basin geometries. If there is no prior knowledge
available, a good starting point is to actually visualize
the interesting part of the phase space to get a ﬁrst idea
of the appearance of, e.g., fractal sets.
If any are de-
tected, it is necessary to use the highest available numer-
ical precision ph to get ˆSB(ph), potentially avoiding ar-
tifacts respectively insigniﬁcant estimations. We suggest
to repeat the SB estimation at a lower numerical preci-
sion pl and take the diﬀerence ˆep = | ˆSB(ph) − ˆSB(pl)| as
a straight-forward (rough) estimator of the variability of
ˆSB(p) with p and, by way of extrapolation, as a rough
estimate of the remaining standard error of ˆSB(ph) as
an estimate of SB due to ﬁnite numerical precision. To
assess the inﬂuence of rounding errors on ˆSB then com-
pare ˆep with the standard error of ˆSB(ph) as an estimate
of SB(ph) due to sampling, which can be estimated as

instance, this could be implemented by comparing the
results at double and single precision computations.
