Abstract

We study the wave equation for a string with stiﬀness. We solve the equation and
provide a uniqueness theorem with suitable boundary conditions. For a pinned string we
compute the spectrum, which is slightly inharmonic. Therefore, the widespread scale of
12 equal divisions of the just octave is not the best choice to tune instruments like the
piano. Basing in the theory of dissonance, we provide a way to tune the piano in order
to improve its consonance. A good solution is obtained by tuning a note and its ﬁfth by
minimizing their beats.

Keywords: wave equation, vibrating string, stiﬀness, inharmonic spectrum, musical
scale, dissonance

1 Introduction

The problem of ﬁnding appropriate scales for playing music has worried musical theorists and
instrument makers for centuries. There is a close relationship between the theory of musical
scales and the frequency spectra of musical instruments; indeed, the harmonic spectrum of most
instruments has lead to the present-day tempered scale, with 12 equal divisions of the octave
(12-edo). However, piano strings have some degree of stiﬀness, which implies that their spectrum
is slightly inharmonic, and this explains why the tuning of the piano is actually “stretched”,
with octaves slightly larger than should [5, p. 389]. The purpose of this paper is to perform an
accurate mathematical study of the wave equation of a string with stiﬀness, and what does it
imply to the choice of a scale. Throughout the paper we will assume an elementary knowledge

of acoustics (physical and a perceptive properties of the sound) and of music theory (intervals
and the tempered scale); nevertheless, the reader may proﬁt from consulting books like [1, 11].
Let us start by brieﬂy explaining the notions of scale and spectrum, and their relationship.
In most musical instruments only a ﬁnite set of pitches (frequencies) is directly playable; these
are the notes and they form scales. The problem is: how to choose these scales? From ancient
times it is said that two similar strings sounding together are more pleasant when their lenghts
(equivalently, their fundamental frequencies) are in a ratio of small integers. So one would look
for a scale whose notes have such frequency ratios. However, due to the coexistence of many
diﬀerent intervals and to the usage of diﬀerent tonalities, the problem of deﬁning a scale does
not have a universal optimal solution. This explains why, from antiquity to modern times,
dozens of scales have been proposed and put into practice; some of these scales can be classiﬁed
in groups like pythagorean and just tunings, mean-tone and irregular temperaments, equal
divisions of octave, etc [6]. The evolution of musical language eventually lead to the so-called
equal temperament (12-edo), which is pervasive in Western music since 19th century.

sinusoids A sin(2πν1t) and A sin(2πν2t) (two pure tones) is 2 A cos(cid:0)2π ν1−ν2

The relevance of frequency ratios of small integers can be explained by the harmonic spectrum
together with the theory of dissonance. A pure tone of frequency ν is described by a sinusoid
A sin(2πνt). A musical sound is usually a superposition of pure tones (the partials) of several
frequencies (and amplitudes); these constitute the spectrum of the sound. For instance, most
wind and string instruments have harmonic spectrum, i.e., its spectral frequencies are integer
multiples of a fundamental frequency: fn = n f1. It is well-known that the superposition of two
the frequency diﬀerence ν1 − ν2 is small (about less than 10–15 Hz), one perceives a sound
of frequency ν = ν1+ν2
2 with slightly varying amplitude; these are the beats. If the frequency
diﬀerence is somewhat bigger, one perceives some roughness. When the diﬀerence is even higher,
then one perceives two separate tones [10, pp. 37–40]. This roughness gives rise to the notion of
sensory dissonance; this will be the only notion of dissonance we are concerned about, though
there are others [9] [13, chap. 5].

Now, consider two (or more) complex tones sounding together: they have many partials
that may be close in frequencies. In the middle of 19th century H. Helmholtz described the
dissonance as the roughness produced by close partials, and the consonance as the exceptional
condition where this roughness almost disappears; by computing the beats of the partials of two
harmonic tones, Helmholtz showed that the classical just intervals of music (octave 2:1, ﬁfth 3:2,
fourth 4:3, thirds 5:4 and 6:5, etc) are more consonant than others [7, p. 193], in good agreement
with music theory. This result can be easily understood: just notice that, if the fundamental
frequencies f, ˜f of two harmonic tones are in a ratio of small integers ˜f : f = (cid:96) : k, then the (cid:96)-th
partial of the ﬁrst tone will be coincide with the k-th partial of the second one; a slight change
of ˜f would lead to close but diﬀerent partials, and therefore to some roughness.

If the spectrum is not harmonic, then most likely the maximal consonance will not be attained
at the just intervals, and therefore the scales based on the harmonic spectrum might not be so
suitable. Then, a detailed analysis of the dissonance curve of the spectrum can give us some
hints to ﬁnd more appropriate scales as far as the consonance of its intervals is concerned [13].
√
This can be applied to the string with stiﬀness. We will show in section 2 that its frequency
1 + Bn2 (n ≥ 1), where B is a small constant. Notice that the
spectrum is given by fn = n f0
√
√
ratio between the ﬁrst and the second partials is not the just octave 2:1, but a “stretched octave”
2
1 + B. So the question arises as to whether one can ﬁnd scales for this spectrum
that could possibly be more “consonant” than the usual 12-edo scale. Aiming to preserve the

freedom to modulate to any tonality, we look for a scale with equal steps, or, equivalently, equal
divisions of a certain interval, as for instance a stretched octave. By studying the dissonance
curve of the stretched spectrum, and by analysing a weighted mean of the dissonance, we obtain
that a good solution is to tune the ﬁfth by making the second partial of the higher note to
coincide with the third partial of the fundamental note.

The paper is organised as follows.

In section 2 we study the wave equation of a string
with stiﬀness and give an explicit solution when the boundary conditions are those of a pinned
string; we present a rigorous derivation of the spectrum, together with a uniqueness theorem. In
section 3 we recall some facts about the theory of dissonance and how to draw dissonance curves,
and we obtain the dissonance curve of the string with stiﬀness. In section 4 we study several
proposals to tune the piano, either based in the minimisation of the beats or the minimisation
of the mean dissonance. Section 5 is devoted to conclusions.

2 The wave equation for the string with stiﬀness

It is well known [12, 14] that the motion of a vibrating string (for instance, a violin string) can
be represented by the solutions of the problem



x ∈ (0, L), t > 0

∂t2 = c2 ∂2u
∂2u
u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0 t ≥ 0
u(x, 0) = φ(x)

∂x2

∂tu(x, 0) = ψ(x)

x ∈ [0, L]
x ∈ [0, L] ,

(1)

where u(x, t) represents the transversal displacement of the string of length L (represented by
the interval [0, L]) from its equilibrium position, and φ(x) and ψ(x) are, respectively, the initial
shape and velocity of the string. The boundary conditions u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0 for t ≥ 0 mean
that the string has ﬁxed ends and c2 = T /ρ, with T the tension of the string and ρ its linear
density. The value c is the velocity of the travelling waves along the string.

The solution of this equation can be computed using the method of separation of variables,

and we obtain the solution:

Remark These computations only need the hypothesis φ, ψ ∈ L2(0, L) and, so, u ∈ L2(0, L). If
we want the classical solution, u ∈ C2([0, L] × [0,∞)), we need φ ∈ C2([0, L]) and ψ ∈ C1([0, L]).
The model of the wave equation is a good approximation for instruments like the guitar,
whose strings are almost perfectly ﬂexible. However, when we want to model the motion of
the piano strings, which have greater stiﬀness, the classical wave equation is not good enough.
For this reason, a term describing the resistance against bending is added to it, obtaining the
equation [5, p. 64]

where S is the cross-sectional area of the string, E is Young’s modulus of its material, ρ is its

linear density and K is the radius of gyration, deﬁned as K2 :=

The added term is the same that appears in the beam equation (also called Euler–Bernoulli
equation), that models the motion of a vibrating beam or rigid long-shaped material. One can
view (4) as the generalization of a PDE for a vibrating material: the ﬁrst term is due to the
elasticity of the material (its capacity to return to the initial position after a deformation) and
the second, due to the resistance against bending. If the ﬁrst term is zero, the material is not
elastic and we get the beam equation. On the contrary, if the second term is zero, the material
is not rigid and we obtain the wave equation.

2.1 Solving the equation

Equation (4) was studied in [4], where the author guesses the form of some solutions with
separate variables. Besides this article, only a few references in the acoustics literature deal
with the string with stiﬀness, and they merely give approximate solutions of the spectrum,
without further justiﬁcation. So we have found it convenient to perform a detailed study: by
following the standard method of separation of variables we give a solution of the initial value
problem with appropriate boundary conditions.

We start by looking for a solution to equation (4) of the form u(x, t) = X(x)T (t). We have

XT (cid:48)(cid:48) = c2X(cid:48)(cid:48)T − ESK2

(5)

As the left-hand side of the equation depends only on t and the right-hand side, only on x, (5)
has to be a non positive constant, called −ω2 (non positive because we are looking for periodic
solutions in time):

If we look at the time equation, we have an ODE which is easy to solve: Tω(t) = A cos ωt +

We look now for the solutions of the ODE for X:

ESK2

ρ

X (4) − c2X(cid:48)(cid:48) − ω2X = 0 .

(7)

We divide the equation by ESK2/ρ and deﬁne a := c2ρ/ESK2 = T /ESK2 and b := ρω2/ESK2.
After that, (7) becomes X (4) − aX(cid:48)(cid:48) − bX = 0 , whose solutions are of the form

A cosh k1x + B sinh k1x + C cos k2x + D sin k2x ,

and k2 =

Remark The constant f0 would be the fundamental frequency of the string if it did not have
stiﬀnes.

In this way, using the deﬁnition of a and b, we obtain the following relations between k1, k2

(10)

We want to ﬁnd the possible values of k1 and k2, that will determine the possible values of
ω. In order to do it, we will impose the boundary conditions, but now, as the equation is of 4th
order, we need 4 boundary conditions, two more apart from the Dirichlet boundary conditions
on both ends of the string. We will consider two cases:

• X(cid:48) = 0 at the ends. This case appears when the string is clamped at the ends.
• X(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 at the ends. This happens when the string is pinned at the ends, since there is no

moment.

The ﬁrst case, X = X(cid:48) = 0 at the ends of the string, leads to an equation that can be solved
numerically, but is not possible to get a closed formula for the spectrum of frequencies (see [4]
for more details and for an approximate formula). The second case, X = X(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 at the ends
of the string, is easier to solve and will lead us to a formula for the frequencies of the partials.
In the case of the piano, this second option seems to be closer to reality, because the strings are
supported on a bridge. From now on, we will focus in this case.

Pinned boundary conditions We are going to solve the problem with the condition X =
X(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 at the ends of the string. Consider a general solution of (7)

X(x) = A cosh k1x + B sinh k1x + C cos k2x + D sin k2x.

(11)

We want to ﬁnd the possible values of k1 and k2 that make (11) satisfy (non-trivially) the
boundary conditions. Let us impose the boundary conditions at the string ends, x = 0, L.

For x = 0, we obtain:

X(0) = A + C = 0

(12)
From the ﬁrst equation we get −C = A and, replacing it in the second one, we arrive to the
equation A(k2

2) = 0, which implies A = C = 0.

1 + k2

2 = 0 .

and

X(cid:48)(cid:48)(0) = Ak2

1 − Ck2

Now we impose the boundary conditions at x = L to X(x) = B sinh k1x + D sin k2x, obtain-

ing:

X(L) = B sinh k1L + D sin k2L = 0

and

X(cid:48)(cid:48)(L) = Bk2

1 sinh k1L− Dk2
2 and adding it to the second one, we get B(k2

2 sin k2L = 0. (13)

Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by k2
0. As the last two factors are diﬀerent from zero, we conclude that B = 0.

2) sinh k1L =
Finally, we have D sin k2L = 0. As we want nontrivial solutions, we need D (cid:54)= 0 and, thus,
k2L = nπ for n = 1, 2, . . .. Therefore, the solutions of (7) that satisfy the boundary conditions
are of the form

Xn(x) = D sin

with n = 1, 2, . . .

Remark Notice that these are the same modes of vibration as in the case without stiﬀness, so

(16)

As we can see, the spectrum is no longer harmonic, but it is ‘stretched’ from the harmonic
1 + Bn2. Notice that if B = 0, i.e., if there is no stiﬀness, we recover

one due to the factor
the formula for the frequency spectrum of the ideal string.

√

To conclude, we can write the general solution of the PDE (4), with boundary conditions

u = 0 and uxx = 0 at the ends of the string, as:

(17)

where an, bn are obtained from initial conditions in the same way as in the ideal case. As for the
wave equation, Fourier theory guarantees the existence of a generalized solution (in L2) for any
initial conditions φ, ψ ∈ L2((0, L)), and of classical solutions if φ ∈ C4((0, L)) and ψ ∈ C3((0, L)),
where φ and ψ are, respectively, the initial shape and initial velocity.

2.2 Uniqueness of solutions

We prove now a theorem of uniqueness of solutions for the wave equation with stiﬀness. This
can be seen a particular case of the results of semigroup theory for evolution problems with
monotone operators (see [2, 3]), but in this case we provide an elementary proof, similar to the
uniqueness theorem for the wave equation, which can be found for instance in [12]. We will use
the notation ∂n

Thanks to this result, we can now prove the next theorem.

This is also true if, instead of conditions on ∂2
∂xu(L, t) = η(t).

Since all partial derivatives of ﬁrst order of v are zero, v is a constant function. Finally, at t = 0,
v = 0, so v ≡ 0 for all time t ≥ 0. Therfore, u1 = u2.

The proof for boundary conditions on ∂xu is completely analogous.

3 Scales, spectrum and dissonance curves

As we have explained in the introduction, if a spectrum is given, by analysing its dissonance
curve, one can try to ﬁnd appropriate scales for it. In this section we provide some details for
this analysis following [13].

In 1965, R. Plomp and W.J.M. Levelt [9] performed an experiment aiming to measure the
dissonance of two pure tones in terms of their distance; this dissonance was evaluated by many
subjects, and as a result they concluded that the maximal degree of dissonance is attained at
roughly 1/4 of the critical bandwidth, a notion that had been introduced and studied some years
before. They claimed that this could be extrapolated to complex tones. In more detail, taking
a harmonic spectrum with 6 partials (and equal loudnesses) and just adding their dissonances,
Plomp and Levelt obtained a dissonance curve similar to Helmholtz’s, showing points of local
minimal dissonance for frequency ratios α equal to 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 5:3, 4:3, 6:5, 5:4, and a maximum
of dissonance near the semitone interval. Figure 1 shows some of Plomp and Levelt’s results.

their distance measured in critical bandwidths. (b) Dissonance of two harmonic tones as a function of
their frequency ratio; the vertical lines mark the steps of the 12-edo scale.

More recently, W.A. Sethares [13] did a systematic study of the dissonance curve of several
spectra, and showed the close relationship between spectrum and scales; his work includes the
synthesis of artiﬁcial spectra adapted to play music in exotic scales, while still retaining some
degree of consonance.

min((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2)(cid:0)e−b1 s (f2−f1) − e−b2 s (f2−f1)(cid:1), where s =

We want to apply this procedure to the spectrum of the string with stiﬀness. For this we
need a speciﬁc expression of a function modelling the dissonance. Following [13], if x denotes
the frequency diﬀerence expressed in Hz, then the dissonance (in an arbitrary scale) of two
pure tones of frequencies f1 ≤ f2 and loudnesses (cid:96)1, (cid:96)2 can be expressed as d(f1, f2, (cid:96)1, (cid:96)2) =
, and the parametres are b1 = 3.5,
b2 = 5.7, x∗ = 0.24, s1 = 0.021 and s2 = 19. These expressions and numbers give just a possible
model for the dissonance of two tones; other models (see for instance [1]) can be used, and
qualitatively the results are the same.
Then, if F is a spectrum with frequencies f1 < . . . < fn and loudnesses (cid:96)1, . . . , (cid:96)n, the
(cid:80)
dissonance of F is deﬁned as the sum of the dissonances of all the pairs of partials, DF =
i<j d(fi, fj, (cid:96)i, (cid:96)j). Finally, the dissonance curve of a given spectrum F is the function that
yields the dissonance of two tones as a function of the ratio α of their fundamental frequencies:

DF (α) = DF∪αF , where we denote by αF the spectrum F with its frequencies scaled by the
factor α, and by F ∪ αF the union of both spectra.

The graph of the function DF is the dissonance curve of the given spectrum, and its analysis
can help us to ﬁnd an appropriate scale (and conversely: given an arbitrary scale, is there an
appropriate spectrum for it?). Nevertheless, this is not so immediate, and these results do not
tell us how to construct a scale. For instance, consider the harmonic spectrum and its dissonance
curve as in ﬁgure 1 (b). From a reference note —a C, say— one can form a just scale by adding
other notes coinciding with the local minima of the dissonance curve: G (3:2), F (4:3), A (5:3),
E (5:4), E(cid:91) (6:5), etc. Notice, however, that from each of these new notes we should consider
again the dissonance curve in relation with the notes already chosen. This analysis is simpler
when we use an equal-step scale, like 12-edo, because the relative positions of the notes are the
same. In the same ﬁgure we see the abscissas of the 12-edo scale; it is clear that local minima
of dissonance are attained near points that are at a distance of 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 12 steps from
any given note.

Now let us apply this procedure to the piano. As we have already noted in the preceding
sections, its strings have a certain degree of stiﬀness, and, according to (16), their spectrum is
1 + Bn2. We can draw its dissonance curve and we observe that, for small
given by fn = f0
B > 0, the local minima of dissonance are slightly shifted to the right with respect to those of
the harmonic spectrum, see ﬁgure 2.

Figure 2: Comparison betwwen the dissonance curve of the harmonic spectrum (dashed) and the
stretched spectrum of a string with stiﬀness (solid); the vertical lines show the steps of the usual 12-
edo scale.

Notice in particular that the octave and the ﬁfth (the most important intervals of Western
music) of the usual 12-edo scale are noticiably ﬂatter than the “optimal” octave and ﬁfth deduced
from the stretched spectrum, i.e., the corresponding intervals where this spectrum has a local
minimum of dissonance. Therefore the 12-edo scale seems not to be the best choice to play
music as far as dissonance is concerned. This fact makes us wonder which is the “best” tuning
for the piano, i.e., a tuning that ﬁts better with the minima of the dissonance curve. We give
an answer to this question in the next section.

4 Proposals for the piano tuning

We have just seen that, due to the stiﬀness of the strings, the spectrum of the piano is slightly
stretched, and therefore the minima of the dissonance curve does not coincide with the notes
of the usual 12-edo scale, not to say other tunings like just intonation. Now our goal is to ﬁnd
a scale that preserves, as much as possible, the consonance of the main intervals of music. We
will restrict our search to scales with equal steps, because we want to preserve the freedom to
modulate to arbitrary tonalities —this is especially important for piano music. So, if r is the
frequency ratio of the step of the scale, and f is the frequency of its fundamental note, the
frequencies of all the notes are f, r f, r2f, r3f, . . .

We will follow two procedures. The ﬁrst one is based on the coincidence of partials in order
to minimize the beats; we will explore three possible choices for the step and see what do they
imply for the dissonance curve. The second one is to deﬁne an average dissonance as a function
of the step and try to minimise it.

It should be remarked that in this study we assume that the stiﬀness parametre B is constant.
This is approximately true in the middle third of the keyboard [4]. For the lower third of the
keyboard, the stiﬀness parametre of the strings is very low, indeed they are manufactured in a
special way, so that a diﬀerent analysis would be required; besides this, the overall dissonance
in this region is high. For the upper third of the keyboard, the upper partials are weak so that
their eﬀect can be neglected.

√

In all calculations we will use the obtained formula for the partials, fn = n f0

1+Bn2,
as well as the expresions of the dissonance functions deﬁned in section 3. We will consider
B ∈ [0.0004, 0.002] [4], but we will also see that we recover the results for the harmonic case
when B → 0.

4.1 Coincidence of partials

In these proposals of tuning we try to make some of the partials of two notes to coincide. The
strategy is as follows: we consider a ﬁxed note of fundamental frequency f1 and our goal is
to tune a second one, f 1. Once deﬁned, we divide the interval f 1 : f1 in equal parts in order
to obtain a step whose frequency ratio, r, is very close to the frequency ratio of the 12-edo
semitone, 21/12.

We have noticed before that the coincidence of some partials does not necessarily imply
consonance. However, this analysis is meaningful because it can be directly applied to actual
tuning, since it is easy to tune an interval by minimising beats; moreover, we will see later that
one of our proposals will be especially good in terms of dissonance.

As the octave and the ﬁfth are the most important intervals in music, three natural tunings

can be considered:

• A2,1: the second partial f2 of the ﬁrst note coincides with the ﬁrst partial f 1 of the second

note. (We try to minimize the beats of the octave.)

• A3,1: the third partial f3 of the ﬁrst note coincides with the ﬁrst partial f 1 of the second

note. (We try to minimize the beats of the twelfth.)

• A3,2: the third partial f3 of the ﬁrst note coincides with the second partial f 2 of the second

note. (We try to minimize the beats of the ﬁfth.)

Figure 3: In the upper line we show the partials of the stretched spectrum; they are compared with the
harmonic ones (black nodes). In the lower lines we show the partials for the octave of 12-edo and for the
stretched octave of A2,1, the twelfth of A3,1, and the ﬁfth of A3,2.

Once we have tuned our interval f 1 : f1, we divide it in n equal parts: 12 for the octave, 19
for the twelfth, and 7 for the ﬁfth. These steps are the semitones of the corresponding tuning.
Their frequency ratio is given by (f1/f1)1/n; in our cases, they are:

(cid:18) 1 + 9B

(cid:19)1/38

1 + B

r3,2 =

(cid:18) 1 + 4B

(cid:19)1/24

1 + B

(24)
Each of these steps deﬁnes a scale, and we can compare its notes with the local minima of
the dissonance curve, as explained in the preceding section. One of our main goals is to tune
the octave, the most important interval in music. Therefore, we analyze in particular how the
octaves generated by these steps (the ratio obtained by r12, for each r) ﬁt with the minimum of
each of the dissonance curves near 2, as shown in ﬁgure 4.

Figure 4: The dissonance curve of the stretched spectrum near the octave generated by diﬀerent steps
r (vertical line) (a) r = 21/12 (12-edo). (b) r = r2,1. (c) r = r3,1. (d) r = r3,2.

From that ﬁgure it appears that the tuning A3,2 ﬁts better than the others the minimum of
dissonance at the octave. This may seem paradoxical because A2,1 was set to tune the octave
ad hoc, but actually this tuning only makes the dissonance caused by a single pair of partials to
disappear, whereas other partials may give rise to higher dissonance.

4.2 Minimisation of dissonance

The preceding analysis can be completed by performing a general study of the dissonance of
all the intervals between f1 and the other notes r f1, r2f1, r3f1, . . . of the scale, as a function
of its step, r. We would like to ﬁnd the semitone r which minimises (in some sense) the total
dissonance of the scale.

X. Gr`acia and T. Sanz-Perela — The wave equation for stiﬀ strings and piano tuning

12

So, given a semitone r, we deﬁne the mean dissonance of the equal step scale generated by

r as a weighted average of the dissonances of all the intervals of the scale3:

N(cid:88)

Dm(r) :=

wkDF (rk) ,

(25)

k=1

where F is the spectrum of the fundamental note of the scale, including frequencies and loud-
nesses, and w = (wk) is a vector of weights. The weighting is considered because not all intervals
are equally used in music, and their consonances are not equally important. In the following
calculations we have used w = (1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 4, 4, 2, 1, 10) to give preeminence to the ocatve,
the ﬁfth, etc. Intervals larger than an octave could be considered in the sum; we omit them
because their eﬀect on the dissonance is small and we have to cut the sum at some point.
If we minimize numerically the function Dm(r) on the interval r ∈ [1.0585, 1.061], near the
12-edo semitone 21/12, we ﬁnd diﬀerent values for the minimum point r∗ depending on B. We
want to compare these results with the three proposals considered before, so we obtain the
following plots, measured in cents4:

Figure 5: (a) Plot of Dm(r) for diﬀerent values of B ∈ [0, 0.002]. The marked points correspond to the
minimum in each case and the vertical line represents the 12-edo semitone. (b) Distance to the 12-edo
semitone of the three tunings and the optimal semitone (in cents).

As we can see, the semitone of A3,2 approximates the optimal semitone: (a) better than the
12-edo semitone if B is higher than 0.00025 (b) better than the other proposals if B is higher
than 0.0005, and (c) coincides with the optimal semitone if B is higher than 0.001. Notice also
that the optimal semitone coincides with the 12-edo semitone when B = 0.

The graphic in ﬁgure 5, computed with Matlab, has been obtained using 6 partials, a fun-
damental frequency f0 = 440 Hz, the weighting vector as deﬁned before, and the amplitudes
inversely proportional to the number of the partial. Nevertheless, we have also checked that the
results obtained are quite similar if we use the same amplitude for all partials, the same weights
for all intervals, or 7 partials.

3More generally, for a scale of general type we could deﬁne a mean dissonance by taking a weighted sum of
the dissonances of all couples of notes. For an equal step scale it is enough to consider the dissonance of all the
notes with respect to a given note.

4Recall that a cent is a hundredth of a 12-edo semitone, that is, a fraction 1/1200 of an octave.

5 Conclusions

We have studied the spectrum of strings with stiﬀness, like those of the piano. Although this
was already known, we have done a mathematically rigorous derivation of it. Then, we have
applied this result to study the tuning of the piano. If we wish to tune the piano with equal
semitones, it appears that a good solution that minimizes the dissonance of the main intervals
of music is to tune a note and its ﬁfth by forcing their 3rd and 2nd partials, respectively, to
coincide.
