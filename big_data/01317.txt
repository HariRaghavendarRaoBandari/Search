Abstract

Devastating ﬂoods in northeast Pakistan and northern India occurred in July 2010 and September

2014 as a consequence of extreme precipitation events. The 2010 and 2014 ﬂood events had similar

synoptic ﬂow patterns that led to an anomalously high moisture content in the ﬂood region. The

quasi-geostrophic omega equation is inverted in order to attribute components of the large-scale

vertical motion proﬁle to synoptic forcing, diabatic heating, and mechanically forced orographic as-

cent. The results show that diabatic heating is the dominant contributor to the large-scale vertical

motion, and suggest that the orographic forcing by ﬂow over the Himalayas is the dominant mecha-

nism by which the convection that produces the heating is forced. Analysis of a longer data record

shows that instances of extreme precipitation in this region over the last eleven years are closely as-

sociated with simultaneously large values of orographic forcing and column-total precipitable water

vapor.

Introduction

In early September 2014, near the end of the monsoon season, heavy rains caused landslides and

ﬂooding in the Jammu and Kashmir region of India and nearby regions of Pakistan, killing hundreds

of people (Mishra, 2015).

Extreme rainfall in roughly the same region (the precipitation region can be seen in ﬁgure 1) led

to historic ﬂoods of the Indus river basin in northeast Pakistan, submerging a signiﬁcant fraction

of the country and causing over 2000 deaths (Akthar , 2011). The July 2010 ﬂoods were related

to an extratropical blocking anticyclone event that also led to an intense heat wave in Russia

(Lau and Kim, 2011). A southeasterly ﬂow was present over India during the end of July 2010,

caused by an intense pressure gradient between an anticyclone over the Tibetan Plateau and a low

pressure disturbance traveling westward across India (Houze et al., 2011; Rasmussen et al., 2015).

This southeasterly ﬂow brought moisture into northwest India and eastern Pakistan, where the
moist air stream was lifted as it reached the slopes of the Himalaya.

We are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the dynamics of these events of 2010 and

2014, as well as other similar events (e.g. Rahmatullah (1952) described a ﬂood in the region during

August 1949 that was also related to a southeasterly ﬂow over India due to a mid-tropospheric

trough). Two necessary conditions for an extreme precipitation event are upward motion and a

suﬃcient supply of moisture. The events occurred in the western foothills of the Himalayas, a region

with a very steep gradient of topography (ﬁgure 1). Steep topography gradients are well known to be

able to produce orographic precipitation when moist air ﬂow impinges on them (Roe , 2005; Smith,

2006). These events occur in a suﬃciently warm, humid environment that the precipitation may be

convective, at least in part, with some of the vertical motion connected to diabatic heating which

allows air parcels to ascend across potential temperature surfaces. At the same time, upper-level

disturbances can cause ascent through quasi-adiabatic potential vorticity dynamics. We attempt

here to quantify the roles of each of these processes in the 2010 and 2014 events.

The events of 2010 were extensively studied in Martius et al. (2013) and Galarneau et al. (2012).

It was concluded that the transport and convergence of moist air into the ﬂood region was driven

by monsoonal low-level ﬂow features and that positive potential vorticity anomalies at upper lev-

els, reaching Pakistan from the extratropics, induced a surface wind ﬁeld that had a signiﬁcant

component directed orthogonal to the topographic barrier. It was also suggested that the upward

motion was mainly driven by the forcing of topography and that forced quasi-geostrophic ascent

from the upper-level large-scale ﬂow was fairly weak. In this study, we extend these two studies in

three ways. First, we perform a more in-depth analysis of the factors inﬂuencing large-scale verti-

cal motion in greater detail for the 2010 event, including examining the vertical proﬁles of vertical

motion attributable to diﬀerent factors via quasi-geostrophic omega equation. Second, we apply

the same approach to the 2014 event. Third, we place both events in longer historical context by
examining the association of extreme precipitation events over a ten-year period with the factors

identiﬁed as likely causal inﬂuences in the 2010 and 2014 events.

The quasi-geostrophic omega equation (Clough et al., 1996; Gray and Dacre, 2006) is a useful

framework for understanding and quantifying the factors associated with vertical motion outside

the deep tropics. While the assumptions of quasi-geostrophic theory are not technically valid in

this application, due to the large topographic variation in the region of interest as well as other

possible violations, it is nonetheless a useful exercise to apply the theory and see how well it

works. The results in section 4 demonstrate that the omega equation captures the dynamics quite

well. A great advantage of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation is that it is linear, allowing

for direct decomposition of the vertical motion into components forced by the large-scale quasi-

adiabatic dynamics, diabatic heating, and orography. A more exact nonlinear model would not

2

allow such a straightforward decomposition. The inclusion of the contributions of diabatic heating

and orography, not considered in previous work, allows for a direct comparison with the actual

vertical velocity and thus provides conﬁrmation of the validity of using this model for these events,

as well as a more complete description of the vertical motion.

These precipitation events involve deep convection, large diabatic heating in the troposphere,

and thus vertical motion directly associated with that heating in the omega equation. What is

not so easily apparent is the role of each of the possible factors in causing the convection. One

possibility is that the large scale circulation induces upward motion that forces the convection.

Another possibility is that when surface winds are aligned towards the topographic barrier, the

upward motion forced mechanically near the surface then triggers the convection. To fully un-

derstand what is driving the vertical motion, it is necessary to understand the interactions of the

large-scale circulation and topographically forced lifting with the convective heating. The current

study is limited to analyzing observational data, takes the heating rate as a given, and thus cannot

explicitly determine what causes that heating. However, the analysis developed here is used to

provide forcing terms which are used in the modeling study by Nie et al. (2016), using the column

quasi-geostrophic method of Nie and Sobel (2016) in order to more directly separate the inﬂuences

of causal understanding of the controls exerted by orographic lifting and upper-level disturbances

on the convection. Here we establish, as necessary prerequisites to that analysis, that the con-

vection is the essential component of both the 2010 and 2014 events, in that the diabatic heating

is the dominant forcing term in the omega equation. We also show that the magnitude of the

vertical motion directly forced by orographic lifting is consistently larger than that of the synoptic

forcing due to the upper-level disturbances, which suggests that the orographic forcing is the more

important inﬂuence on the convection.

In the rest of this study we focus on the extreme rainfall events of September 4-17, 2014, and

on the two three-day extreme rainfall events of July 20-23 and 27-30, 2010, referred to hereafter as

the ﬁrst and second event of 2010, respectively. The data that are used are discussed in section 2,

a description of the three ﬂood events and the moisture transport is given in section 3, diagnoses of

the inﬂuences on vertical motion using the quasi-geostrophic omega equation are given in section
4, analysis of a longer historical record to place the 2010 and 2014 events in context is in section 5,

and concluding remarks are given in section 6.

2 Data

The ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset (Dee et al., 2011) was used for the analysis discussed in this

paper. Most of the ERA-Interim ﬁelds that were used have a 6-hourly temporal resolution and a

spatial resolution of 0.7◦. The ERA-Interim precipitation ﬁeld used is the short-range ECMWF

forecast, which is available at 12-hourly temporal resolution. The ERA-Interim precipitation was

also compared to the 3B42 Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data, which
has a 3-hourly temporal resolution and a 0.25◦ spatial resolution (Huﬀman et al., 2001, 2007).

3

A ﬂood domain used for area-averaged time-series calculations was deﬁned as the region from

70◦ to 77◦ longitude and 30◦ to 37◦ latitude. This region can be seen in ﬁgure 1.

3 Description of ﬂood events

Figure 2 shows the three-day accumulated precipitation of both 2010 events and the 2014 event for

both the ERA-Interim and TRMM datasets. Both the ERA-Interim and TRMM datasets show

extreme rainfall totals in the respective ﬂood domains for all three events and there is relatively

good spatial agreement between the two datasets. One discrepancy is that TRMM shows less

rainfall than does ERA-Interim for the 2010 ﬁrst event. The maximum total rainfall for a single

grid point in the ﬂood domain for the 2010 ﬁrst event was 196 mm and 219 mm from ERA-Interim

and TRMM, respectively; the maximum total rainfall for a single grid point for the 2010 second

event was 212 mm and 310 mm; and the maximum total rainfall for a single grid point in the ﬂood

domain for the 2014 event was 212 mm and 430 mm. The diﬀerences in the maxima between the two
datasets may be due in part to the TRMM data’s higher spatial resolution than the ERA-Interim

data.

3.1

2010 ﬁrst event: 07-20-10 to 07-23-10

Figure 3(a) shows area-averaged time series of precipitation and column precipitable water during

July 2010. Prior to the ﬁrst precipitation event, a heat low was present to the northwest of Pakistan

(Martius et al., 2013). This region of low pressure can be seen in the 500-hPa height anomalies

shown in ﬁgure 4(a) along with a high-pressure anomaly located over the Bay of Bengal. These

low and high pressures led to southwesterlies that transported moisture from the Arabian Sea into

the ﬂood region. The precipitation event commenced on July 20th and the precipitable water rose

above 35 mm.

3.2

2010 second event: 07-27-10 to 07-30-10

Between July 25 and 28, a low pressure system traveled from the Bay of Bengal westward across

India to the Arabian Sea, while a weaker low pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal

and an extreme high pressure anomaly was located over the Tibetan Plateau and northern India

(Houze et al., 2011). These systems (seen in ﬁgures 4(b) and 5) provided a very strong pressure

gradient which resulted in southeasterly ﬂow that transported moisture from the Bay of Bengal

into the ﬂood region (Martius et al., 2013; Galarneau et al., 2012)). These large pressure gra-

dients (as well as the pressure gradients in the ﬁrst 2010 event) are very unusual in this region.

Romatschke and Houze (2010) found that for typical rainstorms in the western Himalayan foothills,

dry air advected into the region from the Afghan Plateau surrounds intense convective clouds and

does not permit their growth into larger storms with large precipitation areas. This stands in

contrast to this event, where the large pressure gradient brought an extreme amount of moisture
into the region and allowed for very large storms to develop. As seen in ﬁgure 3(a), the strong

4

pressure gradient resulted in a dramatic increase in area-average precipitable water to 45 mm. The

very large amount of precipitable water can also be seen in ﬁgure 4(e).

3.3

2014 event: 09-04-14 to 09-07-14

Figure 3(b) shows area-averaged time series of precipitation and precipitable water during Septem-

ber 2014. Similar to the 2010 events, the evolution of precipitable water shows pre-moistening for

several days before the onset of rainfall, with the precipitable water peaking during the middle of

the precipitation events and then decreasing.

Figure 4(f) shows that there was anomalously high precipitable water over all of Pakistan, which

is similar, though less intense, to the state during the second event of 2010 (ﬁgure 4(e)).

Figure 4 (a-c) also shows large variability in the height ﬁeld. The ﬁrst event of 2010 has a

northwest-southeast dipole, the second event of 2010 has a southwest-northeast dipole, and the

2014 event has a west-east dipole. These dipoles are consistent with the low level ﬂow which

transported moisture into the ﬂood region: the moisture for the ﬁrst event of 2010 came form the

Arabian sea, while the moisture for the second event of 2010 and the 2014 events came from the

Bay of Bengal (ﬁgures 5 and 6).

Figure 6 shows the time evolution of the 500 hPa height ﬁeld anomaly along with the 700

hPa moisture ﬂux. From 08-31-14 to 09-03-14 there was a similar pressure conﬁguration to the

second event of 2010, with a strong depression moving westward over India and a high pressure

anomaly over the Tibetan Plateau, which resulted in southeasterlies transporting moisture from

the Bay of Bengal into India and Pakistan and the area-average precipitable water in the ﬂood

region increasing from roughly 20 mm to 35 mm (ﬁgure 3(b)). The similarity of the evolution of

this ﬂow pattern can be seen in comparing ﬁgures 6 and 5. The Tibetan anti-cyclone dissipated in

the 2014 event instead of persisting like the 2010 event, but the position and timing of the transit

of the low pressure across India is very similar. Subsequent to the low pressure transit, the high

pressure anomaly weakened and a new depression formed over the Bay of Bengal.

4 Quasi-geostrophic Omega Equation

The quasi-geostrophic omega equation is a diagnostic equation for the quasi-geostrophic pressure

vertical velocity, ω:

is the horizontal Laplacian, and J is the heating rate. The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of
Eq. (1) represents diﬀerential vorticity advection, the second term is the horizontal Laplacian of

temperature advection, and the third term is the horizontal Laplacian of diabatic heating. We refer

to the ﬁrst two terms as contributions from the large-scale circulation, or as synoptic forcing.

The right hand side of Eq. (1) can be computed solely from the geopotential, Φ, and the heating

rate, J. Φ is available in the ERA-Interim reanalysis, but J is not. J, therefore, is diagnosed from

the temperature tendency equation:

∂t

∂Φ

(2)

where ˜ω is the actual pressure vertical velocity, which need not be identical to the quasi-geostrophic

one, ω, derived from (1). Here we obtain ˜ω from the ERA-Interim reanalysis.

Equation (1) was inverted for the three ﬂood events between 550 hPa and 175 hPa using Stone’s

method, also known as the strongly implicit procedure, (Stone, 1968). In order to decompose ω, the

inversion is ﬁrst carried out with only the ﬁrst two forcing terms on the right hand side of equation

1 (referred to as the contribution of the synoptic advection terms) and a lower boundary condition

of ω set to zero. Secondly, the inversion is carried out with only the third term on the right hand

side of equation 1 (referred to as contribution of the convective heating term) and a lower boundary

condition of ω set to zero. Thirdly, the inversion is carried out with no forcing terms on the right

hand side of equation 1 (referred to as the contribution of the boundary condition) and a lower
boundary condition of ω set to a topographic omega, ωqg(ps), which is described below.

The lower boundary of 550 hPa was chosen because the ﬂood regions have a very large topo-

graphic gradient inside them which leads to time-mean surface pressures ranging from 990 hPa

to 585 hPa. Choosing a lower boundary at 550 hPa ensures that the entire domain is above the
surface.1 The upper boundary of 175 hPa was chosen as a nominal tropopause. The domain used
to perform the inversion was from 0◦ to 55◦ latitude and 25◦ and 100◦ longitude. ωqg was set to
zero at the horizontal boundaries and at the upper boundary. The horizontal domain size is large

enough that the horizontal boundary conditions have no eﬀect on the solution in the ﬂood region.

The resolution used in the inversion is the same as the resolution of the ERA-Interim data,

which has horizontal resolution of 0.7◦ and vertical resolution of 25 hP a in the lower troposphere

and 50 hP a in the mid-troposphere.

The topographic vertical velocity, w(ps), is computed using the geostrophic velocities at the

surface:

w(ps) = vg(ps) · ∇h

(3)

1An alternative approach is detailed in the Appendix.

6

where vg(ps) is the geostrophic velocity linearly interpolated to the local surface pressure, ps, and
h is the height of the topography. The topographic vertical velocity is then converted to the

topographic omega using the hydrostatic approximation:

ω(ps) = −ρgw(ps)

(4)

In the presence of a sloping lower boundary, the natural boundary condition to use is the

topographically forced vertical velocity by the geostrophic wind at a level close to the surface. Here

we consider the appropriate level to use for this purpose. Figures 7 (a)-(d) show the magnitude

and direction of the reanalysis and geostrophic velocities as a function of the pressure above the

surface. While the reanalysis velocities are well approximated by the geostrophic velocities in the

free troposphere, there is clearly a planetary boundary layer (PBL) near the surface where frictional

eﬀects cannot be neglected and the velocity is not geostrophic.

Figure 7 (e) shows a comparison of the reanalysis vertical velocity at the surface, the topographic

forced vertical velocity by the surface reanalysis winds, and the topographic forced vertical velocity

by the surface geostrophic winds. The reanalysis vertical velocity and the topographic forced

vertical velocity by the surface reanalysis winds closely match and show a strong diurnal cycle with

no visible signal during the ﬂood events. Due to the mismatch of the reanalysis and the geostrophic

winds at the surface, the topographic forced vertical velocity by the surface geostrophic winds do
not match the others and is the only one to have an upward vertical velocity signal during the ﬂood

events.

Figure 7 (f) shows a comparison of the reanalysis vertical velocity at the top of the PBL,

the topographic forced vertical velocity by the reanalysis winds at the top of a nominal PBL,

deﬁned as a level 150 hPa above the surface, and the topographic forced vertical velocity by the

geostrophic winds at the top of the PBL. Now, all of the velocities match well and show a positive

vertical velocity signal during the ﬂood events. Other PBL heights were tested (not shown) and

a height of 150 hPa was found to deliver the best match.

It is high enough to ensure that the

reanalysis winds are well approximated by the geostrophic winds and low enough to ensure that

the reanalysis vertical velocity matches the topographic forced vertical velocity. Therefore, the

topographic forced vertical velocity by the geostrophic winds at a PBL height of 150 hPa was used

as the lower boundary condition for the inversion of the omega equation.

ω(ps) is deﬁned at the top of the PBL. This level ranges from a pressure of roughly 840 hPa to
440 hPa, so using it as the lower boundary condition at 550 hPa is somewhat artiﬁcial. Nevertheless,

it is a simple method for attempting to include the eﬀects of orographic forcing.

Figures 8(a) and 8(e) show area-averaged proﬁles of w from inverting the omega equation, split

into the contributions from the synoptic advection terms, the convective heating term, and the

boundary condition, as well as the reanalysis w for the ﬁrst event of 2010. Shown are point-in-time

proﬁles at 07-22-10 0000 (which was the time of maximum vertical velocity for this event) and

a three-day average over the whole event from 07-20-10 to 07-23-14. Both the point-in-time and

time-averaged solutions match the reanalysis proﬁle well, with the point-in-time solution overesti-

7

mating slightly in the middle of the domain. In the point-in-time solution, while the contribution

of the heating term is greatest, the advection terms contribute signiﬁcantly, with the advection

terms contribution being roughly half of the heating term contribution at mid-levels. For the

time-averaged solution, the advection terms’ net contribution is of the same order as the heating
term contribution. The eﬀect of the topographic lower boundary condition decays with height, as

expected, and the boundary condition underestimates the reanalysis vertical velocity at 550 hPa.

Similarly, ﬁgures 8(b) and 8(f) show area-averaged proﬁles of w from inverting the omega

equation as well as the reanalysis w for the second event of 2010. Again, shown are point-in-time

proﬁles at 07-29-10 0600 (which was the time of maximum vertical velocity for this event) and

a three-day average over the whole event from 07-27-10 to 07-30-14. Both the point-in-time and

three-day average solutions again match the reanalysis proﬁles closely. In contrast to the ﬁrst event,

the heating term dominates to a larger extent. In particular, the contribution of the advection terms

in the point-in-time solution is much weaker than in the ﬁrst event.

Figures 8 (c) and 8 (g) show area-averaged proﬁles of w from inverting the omega equation

as well as the reanalysis w for the 2014 event. Shown are point-in-time proﬁles at 09-05-14 0600

(which was the time of maximum vertical velocity for this event) and a three-day average over the

whole event from 09-04-14 to 09-07-14. As with the 2010 events, the overall agreement between

the total solution and the reanalysis proﬁle is quite good. The heating term completely dominates

in both the point-in-time and time-averaged solutions, which is similar to the second event of 2010

but to an even greater extent.

For all three events, the magnitude of the lower boundary condition on the vertical velocity

is of the same order as the interior maxima associated with the heating term. This closeness

in magnitude suggests that the topographic forced lifting of the lower boundary condition may

be a signiﬁcant trigger for the convective heating. Further investigation of this inference using

cloud-resolving model simulations is presented by Nie et al. (2016).

Figure 9 shows the time evolution spanning both 2010 events of the w proﬁles from inverting the

omega equation and the reanalysis. Shown are the sum of the contributions from the two advection

terms (which captures the eﬀect of the large scale circulation), the contribution of the heating term,
the sum of all terms (excluding the boundary condition), and the reanalysis. The total solution

matches the reanalysis w well for both events, with the exception of the ﬁrst weak peak of the ﬁrst

event which the solution underestimates. As seen in the previous two ﬁgures, the advection terms,

and thus the large scale circulation, have a much larger eﬀect during the ﬁrst event than the second

event, which was also found by Martius et al. (2013). Figure 10 shows the time evolution of the w

proﬁles from inverting the omega equation and the reanalysis for the 2014 event. Like the second

event of 2010, there is no discernible signal in the advection terms during the ﬂood event, with all

of the vertical velocity being forced by heating.

Figure 11 shows maps of the large-scale circulation forced w at 350 hPa during the peaks of the

three events. As expected, the solution is more active poleward of the ﬂood regions where there

are larger wind velocities due to the jet stream. As seen before, only the ﬁrst event of 2010 has

8

signiﬁcant forced lifting by the circulation.

5 Historical comparison

The above analysis suggests that the amount of precipitable water and the topographic forced

vertical velocity were the dominant causes of the three ﬂood events. It is useful to determine if

the relationship between these forcings and extreme amounts of precipitation in this region found

for the 2010 and 2014 events also exists historically. This will also reveal how often the levels of

precipitable water, topographic forced lifting, and precipitation rate seen during the ﬂood events

occur in this region. To this end, the monsoon seasons were examined from 2004 through 2014.

Figure 12(a) shows ﬂood-domain averaged precipitation rate for one-day averaged time periods

for June though September of the years 2004 though 2014 as a function of the amount of precipitable

water and the topographic forced vertical velocity. The three ﬂood events examined in this study

are indicated with black outlines. There is a clear relationship between the precipitation and
the other two variables, with days with high levels of precipitable water and topographic forcing

corresponding to days with high levels of precipitation.

Figure 12(b) is similar to ﬁgure 12(b) but with three-day averages instead of one-day averages.

There is again a clear relationship between the precipitation and the other two variables, with the

two events of 2010 being particularly extreme in all variables and the 2014 event somewhat weaker.

6 Conclusion

Devastating ﬂoods in northeast Pakistan and north India occurred in July 2010 and September

2014. These ﬂoods were the result of three extreme precipitation events (two in July 2010 and one
in September 2014). This study has compared the events and attempted to describe the factors

that supported the events, speciﬁcally the circulation that brought moisture into the region and

the driving factors of the upward motion that led to the precipitation.

The vertical motion was analyzed through inverting the quasi-geostrophic omega equation,

which allowed for the contribution of the large-scale circulation forcing to be quantiﬁed. The

omega equation solutions matched the reanalysis vertical motion fairly well for all three events.

The topographic forced vertical motion was also calculated using the geostrophic winds at the top

of the PBL.

All three events had anomalously high amounts of moisture in the region due to the conﬁguration

of the ﬂow ﬁeld that transported moisture into the region from either the Bay of Bengal or the

Arabian Sea. Large amounts of moisture can induce unusually extreme precipitation events from

the orographic forcing due to the large topographic gradient of the Himalayas (Houze et al., 2011).

It is found that while all three events had large pre-moistening prior to the onset of rainfall,

the 500 hPa height surfaces and moisture sources show diﬀerences. The speciﬁc ﬂow pattern and

moisture source in the 2014 event were similar to those in the second event of 2010. During these

9

events, there was a strong high pressure over the Tibetan plateau that, along with a depression that

traveled from the Bay of Bengal northwest across India, caused southeasterlies which transported

moisture from the Bay of Bengal onto the continent and into the ﬂood region. In contrast, during

the ﬁrst 2010 event, a high pressure in the Bay of Bengal and a low pressure northeast of Pakistan
led to southwesterlies and moisture transport northeastward from the Arabian Sea.

In contrast to the synoptic analysis, all three events show quite similar features when focusing

only on the local air column and performing the quasi-geostrophic omega decomposition. The

heating term is dominant, which explains the need for pre-moistening. The topographic forced

upward motion is found to be the main triggering factor of the convection, with the synoptic

forcing due to vorticity and temperature advection being relatively weak. This is consistent with

earlier work of Sanders (1984) which computed the quasi-geostrophic ω for a monsoon depression

in 1979 and found that the direct synoptic forcing of ω was only marginally detectible.

The conclusion drawn from these three events are also supported by studying historical data

of this region. An examination of the monsoon season over eleven years demonstrates that to-

pographic forced ascent and moisture content are the main drivers of extreme precipitation. By

identifying common features among those extreme events, the conclusion of this study improves our

understanding of the dynamics of these events, and highlights the two most relevant environmental

factors which regulate their occurrence.

Appendix

The omega equation inversion described in section 4 involved a complication due to the fact that

the ﬂood region contains very tall mountains that extend up to 585 hPa. In order to ensure that

the entire domain is above the surface, the lower boundary was set to 550 hPa and the topographic

vertical velocity was applied at this level.

An alternative approach that is considered here is to use a lower boundary that is below the

surface in some locations. This involves computing a solution below the surface at some locations

and setting the forcing terms in Eq. (1) to zero below the surface. It was shown in section 4 that

the geostrophic velocities at 150 hPa above the surface work well when computing the topographic

vertical velocity. The alternative approach sets the lower boundary at 700 hPa because this is the

level that is roughly 150 hPa above the mean surface pressure in the ﬂood region. With this lower

boundary, the boundary condition was deﬁned at each location as either the reanalysis vertical

velocity at 700 hPa (if the surface is below 700 hPa) or at the surface (if the surface is above 700

hPa).

Figure 13 is the same as ﬁgure 8 but using this alternative approach with the lower boundary

at 700 hPa. The proﬁles show area-averages in the ﬂood region, where only locations above the

surface are used in the averaging at each level. Both approaches show that the solutions match the

reanalysis velocity proﬁles well. Both approaches also show that the heating term is of much more
important than the advection terms for all events except the ﬁrst event of 2010.
