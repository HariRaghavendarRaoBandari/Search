INTRODUCTION

Starting from the discovery of the charmonium-like res-
onance X(3872) by Belle collaboration [1] and later con-
ﬁrmed in some other experiments [2–4], investigation of
the exotic states became one of the interesting directions
in the hadron physics. The exotic states, that is parti-
cles inner structure of which can not be described within
the two- or three quark scheme of standard hadron spec-
troscopy, provide rich information to check contemporary
theories claiming to explain variety of new phenomena.
They can be produced in various exclusive and inclusive
processes of the B meson decays, pp collision, etc. Now,
the hadron spectroscopy contains the numerous family of
the exotic states XYZ, discovered and studied during past
years. Experimental investigations concentrated mainly
on measurements of the masses and decay widths of the
these states, exploration of their spins, parities and C-
parities. The theoretical studies encompass invention of
diﬀerent approaches and methods to calculate features of
the exotic particles (see for instance [5–12] and references
therein).

There are various models in the literature suggested
to reveal the internal quark-antiquark structure of the
exotic states and explain the wide range of correspond-
ing experimental data. One of the popular models is the
four-quark or tetraquark picture of the exotic particles.
In accordance with this approach new charmonium-like
states are composed of two heavy and two light quarks.
These quarks may cluster into the colored diquark and
antidiquark, which are organized in such a way that to
reproduce quantum numbers of the corresponding exotic
states. Other possibilities of the organization of the ex-
otic particles in the context of the tetraquark picture
include a meson-molecule and hadro-quarkonium mod-
els. Among alternative views on the nature of the exotic
states one should mention the ordinary charmonium cc
model and its hybrid extensions. All of these models con-
sider the exotic states as particles containing a pair of c¯c
(or b¯b) quarks. In fact, the known exotic states consist of
c¯c and two light quarks. In other words, the number of

the quark ﬂavors inside of the known four-quark exotic
particles does not exceed three.

s π±, B0

Recently, the D0 Collaboration reported the obser-
vation of a narrow structure X(5568) in the decay
chain X(5568) → B0
s → J/ψφ, J/ψ → µ+µ−,
φ → K +K − based on p¯p collision data at √s =
1.96 TeV collected at the Fermilab Tevatron collider
[13]. The assigned quantum numbers for the Xb state
are J P C = 0++,
its mass extracted from the experi-
ment is equal to mXb = 5567.8±2.9(stat)+0.9
−1.9(syst) MeV,
and the decay width was estimated as Γ = 21.9 ±
6.4(stat)+5.0
−2.5(syst) MeV. As it was emphasized in Ref.
[13] this is the ﬁrst observation of a hadronic state with
four distinct quark ﬂavors. Namely, from the observed
decay channel X(5568) → B0
s π± one can conclude that
the state X(5568) consists of b, s, u, d quarks. First sug-
gestions concerning the quark-antiquark organization of
the new state were made in Ref. [13], as well. Thus,
within the diquark-antidiquark model the X may be
described as [bu][ ¯d¯s], [bd][¯s¯u], [su][¯b ¯d] or [sd][¯b¯u] bound
state. Alternatively, it may be considered as a molecule
composed of B and K mesons.

It is worth noting that in order to distinguish the
X(5568) state from the members of the old X family
of exotic resonances, in Ref. [14] we have introduced the
notation Xb(5568). In what follows we will keep this ab-
breviation. For the ﬁrst time in Ref. [14] we have calcu-
lated the mass and decay constant of the Xb(5568) state
adopting for its structure the [su][¯b ¯d] diquark-antidiquark
model. We have used QCD two-point sum rule method
and taken into account the vacuum condensates up to
dimension eight. Our prediction for the mass of the
Xb(5568) state is in a nice agreement with data of the
D0 Collaboration.

The mass and pole residue of the exotic state Xb(5568)
were also calculated in Ref. [15]. The mass of the state
Xb(5568) was computed in Refs. [16–18], as well. In these
works the authors used various versions for the diquark-
antidiquark type interpolating current to perform rele-
vant calculations. The obtained values in these works
for mXb are in agreement with each other and are also
consistent with experimental data of D0 Collaboration.

In the present paper we extend our investigation of the
newly observed state Xb(5568) by calculating the width
of the dominant decay Xb(5568) → B0
s π+. To this end,
we compute the coupling of the XbB0
s π vertex allowing us
to ﬁnd the required decay width. For calculation of the
strong coupling gXbBsπ we apply methods of QCD light-
cone sum rule (LCSR) supplemented by the soft-meson
approximation [19–21]. The soft-meson approximation is
required because the Xb state contains the four valence
quarks, as a result, the light-cone expansion of the corre-
lation functions reduces to the short-distance expansion
in terms of local matrix elements. This approximation
is rather simple, and was successfully applied for calcu-
lation of the decay widths of the Zc(3900) state in our
previous work Ref. [22].

This article is organized in the following way. In sec-
tion II, we calculate the strong coupling gXbBsπ and
width of the decay Xb(5568) → B0
s π±. Section III con-
tains our numerical result, where we compare our pre-
diction on the width of Xb(5568) state with the relevant
experimental ﬁnding of the D0 Collaboration. This sec-
tion contains also our concluding remarks.

II. THE VERTEX XbBsπ AND STRONG DECAY

Xb → B0

s π+

This section is devoted to calculation of the width of
the Xb → B0
s π decay. To this end, as the ﬁrst step
we calculate the strong coupling gXbBsπ using method
of QCD sum rule on the light-cone in conjunction with
the soft-meson approximation. In order to get the sum
rule expression for the coupling gXbBsπ we consider the
correlation function

where the interpolating currents are given as

Π(p, q) = iZ d4xeipxhπ(q)|T {J Bs(x)J Xb †(0)}|0i,
J Xb (x) = εijkεimn(cid:2)sj(x)Cγµuk(x)(cid:3)hb

(x)i ,

(2)

and

J Bs(x) = bl(x)iγ5sl(x).

(3)

In Eqs. (2) and (3) i, j, k, m, n, l are the color indexes and
C is the charge conjugation matrix.

It is not diﬃcult to obtain Π(p, q) in terms of the phys-

ical degrees of freedom: we get

ΠPhys(p, q) = h0|J Bs|Bs (p)i

p2 − m2
×hXb(p′)|J Xb†|0i

p′2 − m2

(4)

where by dots we denote contributions of the higher res-
onances and continuum states. Here p, q and p′ = p + q,

are the momenta of B0
s , π, and the Xb states, respec-
tively. In order to ﬁnish computation of the correlation
function we introduce the matrix elements

h0|J Bs|Bs (p)i =

hXb(p′)|J Xb†|0i = fXb mXb ,

s (p) π(q)|Xb(p′)i = gXbBsπp · p′.

,

(5)

In Eq. (5) by fXb , mXb we denote the decay constant
and mass of the Xb state, whereas fBs, mBs are the same
parameters of the B0

s meson.

Using these matrix elements for the correlation func-

tion we obtain:

fBsfXbmXb m2

Bs gXbBsπ

ΠPhys(p, q) =

(cid:0)p′2 − m2

Xb(cid:1)(cid:0)p2 − m2

Bs(cid:1) (mb + ms)

p · p′.
(6)
In the soft-meson limit accepted in the present work
q = 0, and as a result, p = p′. The reason why we
apply the soft-meson limit was explained in rather de-
tailed form in our previous article [22]. Nevertheless,
for completeness we provide brieﬂy corresponding argu-
ments.
In fact, the Xb state and interpolating current
Eq. (2) contain four quark ﬁelds at the same space-time
location. Substitution of this current into the correla-
tion function and subsequent contraction of the b and s
quark ﬁelds yield expressions where the remaining light
quarks are sandwiched between the π meson and vacuum
states forming local matrix elements. Stated diﬀerently,
we appear in the situation when dependence of the cor-
relation function on the meson distribution amplitudes
disappears and integrals over the meson DAs reduce to
overall normalization factors. In the context of the QCD
LCSR method such situation is possible in the kinemat-
ical limit q → 0, when the light-cone expansion is re-
placed by the short-distant one. As a result, instead of
the expansion in terms of DAs, one gets expansion over
the local matrix elements [21]. In this limit the relevant
invariant amplitudes in the correlation function depend
only on the variable p2.

In the case under consideration the corresponding in-

variant amplitude reads

ΠPhys(p2) =

+Π(RS:C)(p2),

(cid:0)p2 − m2

fBsfXbmXb m2

(7)

where m2 =(cid:0)m2

Xb + m2

the contribution arising from the higher resonances and
continuum states.

What is also important, instead of the two-variable
Borel transformation on p2 and p′2 , now we have to use
the one-variable Borel transformation on p2: this fact
plays a crucial role in deriving sum rules for the strong
couplings. Indeed, the soft-meson approximation consid-
erably simpliﬁes the QCD side of the sum rules, but leads

to more complicated expression for its hadronic represen-
tation. In the soft limit, the ground state contribution
can be written in the form

ΠPhys(p2) ∼=

fBsfXb mXb m2
BsgXbBsπ
(p2 − m2)2 (mb + ms)

(8)

The Borel transformation on the variable p2 applied to
this correlation function yields

ΠPhys(M 2) =

fBsfXbmXb m2

Bs gXbBsπ

(mb + ms)

(9)

But because we employ the one-variable Borel transfor-
mation, transitions from the exited states with m∗ >
mBs to the ground state in the B0
s channel (similar ar-
guments are valid for the Xb channel, as well) also con-
tribute to the hadronic part of the sum rules. They are
not suppressed relative to the ground state contribution
even after the Borel transformation [20, 21].
In order
to remove all unsuppressed contributions from the sum
rules it is convenient to follow a prescription suggested
in Ref. [20] and act by the operator

(cid:18)1 − M 2 d

dM 2(cid:19) M 2em2/M 2

(10)

to both sides of the sum rules.

Now we have to calculate the correlation function in
terms of the quark-gluon degrees of freedom and ﬁnd the
QCD side of the sum rules. Having contracted s and
b-quark ﬁelds we get

In general, for calculation of the ΠQCD(p, q) we have
to use the light-cone expansion for the s- and b-quark
propagators. But because in the matrix elements the
light quark ﬁelds are already ﬁxed at the point x = 0, it
is enough in calculations to utilize the local propagators.
We choose the s-quark propagator Sij

In order to ﬁx the required local matrix elements we con-
sider the perturbative component of the b-quark (∼ δml)
and terms ∼ δlj from the s-quark propagators carrying
out summations over the color indexes. Thus, using the
overall color factor εijkεimn, color factors of the propa-
gators, and the projector onto a color-singlet state δkm/3
we ﬁnd that for such terms the replacement

is legitimate. For nonperturbative contributions, form-
ing as a product of the perturbative part of one of the
propagators with the term ∼ G from the other one, we
ﬁnd, for example,

This rule allows us to insert into quark matrix elements
the gluon ﬁeld strength tensor G that eﬀectively leads
to three-particle components and corresponding matrix
elements of the pion. We neglect the terms ∼ G2 in our
computations.
Having ﬁnished a color summation one can calculate
the traces over spinor indexes and perform integrations
to extract the imaginary part of the correlation function
ΠQCD(p, q) in accordance with procedures described in
Ref. [22]. Skipping technical details we provide ﬁnal ex-
pression for the spectral density, which consists of the
perturbative and nonperturbative components

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND

CONCLUSIONS

The QCD sum rule for the strong coupling gXbBsπ and

decay width Γ(cid:0)Xb → B0

s π+(cid:1) contain various parameters

that should be ﬁxed in accordance with the standard pro-
cedures: for numerical computations we need the masses
and decay constants of the Xb and B0
s mesons, values
of the quark, gluon and mixed condensates. In addition
to that, QCD sum rules depend on the b and s quark
masses. The values of used parameters are moved to Ta-
ble I. In this Table for the mass and decay constant of Xb
state we have used QCD sum rule predictions obtained in
our work Ref. [14]. The decay constant fBs is borrowed
from Ref. [24] and is the result of lattice calculations.

Calculations require ﬁxing of the threshold parameter
s0 and a region within of which it may be varied. For s0
we employ

33.5 GeV2 ≤ s0 ≤ 35.5 GeV2.

(23)

We also ﬁnd the range 6 GeV2 < M 2 < 8 GeV2 as a
reliable region for the Borel parameter, where the eﬀects
of the higher resonances and continuum states, and con-
tributions of the higher dimensional condensates satisfy
standard requirements of QCD sum rules calculations.

Computation of the strong coupling gXbBsπ yields the

following result:

gXbBsπ = (0.63 ± 0.14) GeV−1.
For the width of the decay Xb(5568) → B0

s π+ we get

(24)

Γ(Xb → B0

s π+) = (24.5 ± 8.2) MeV,

(25)

which within errors is consistent with experimental data
of D0 collaboration.

In this work we have continued our studies of the newly
discovered exotic state Xb(5568) and computed the width
s π+ using methods of QCD
of the strong decay Xb → B0
sum rules on the light-cone and soft-meson approxima-
tion. To this end, ﬁrst we have found the strong coupling

s π+). Our
gXbBsπ that allowed us to calculate Γ(Xb → B0
ﬁnding is consistent with the experimental data of D0
Collaboration.
