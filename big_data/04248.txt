Abstract

A framework is proposed to describe resonant diphoton phenomenology at hadron
colliders in full generality. It can be employed for a comprehensive model-independent
interpretation of the experimental data. Within the general framework, few benchmark
scenarios are deﬁned as representative of the various phenomenological options and/or
of motivated new physics scenarios. Their usage is illustrated by performing a charac-
terization of the 750 GeV excess, based on a recast of available experimental results.

We also perform an assessment of which properties of the resonance could be inferred,
after discovery, by a careful experimental study of the diphoton distributions. These
include the spin J of the new particle and its dominant production mode. Partial
information on its CP-parity can also be obtained, but only for J ≥ 2. The complete
determination of the resonance CP properties requires studying the pattern of the initial
state radiation that accompanies the resonant diphoton production.

Introduction

The resonant production of a photon pair at hadron colliders is quite a simple process, which
we can hope to characterize with a high degree of generality. To do so, ﬁrst of all we need
to understand the possible initial states that can lead to the production of the intermediate
resonance R decaying to γγ. If no additional hard objects are present in the ﬁnal state,
which is our working hypothesis, only a few partonic scattering processes are likely to be
relevant, namely the ones involving gluons (gg), quarks (qq, with q = u, d, c, s, b) or photons
(γγ). “Mixed” situations such as qg-initiated production are forbidden by color conservation
and by Lorentz symmetry, which requires the heavy resonance R to have integer spin J (with
J (cid:54)= 1 by the Landau–Yang theorem). Channels of the type q(cid:48)q with q (cid:54)= q(cid:48) are strongly
disfavored by ﬂavor constraints, which make very diﬃcult to imagine how a resonance within
the energy reach of the LHC might have sizable ﬂavor non-diagonal couplings to the light
quarks. We will thus ignore this possibility in what follows.

Among the other channels that might be considered we can deﬁnitely exclude tt, because
tt-initiated production unavoidably comes together with a tt pair in the ﬁnal state from the
splitting of the initial gluons, while we choose to limit our analysis to ﬁnal states with no
extra hard objects. Although similar considerations hold for bb production, the associated
b-quarks are typically soft. Thus they are hard to detect and to identify as b-jets and can
be easily confused with the radiation pattern that characterizes the other partonic modes.
Still, after the identiﬁcation of a signal and with large enough luminosity, checking for the
presence of bottom quarks will allow to distinguish the bb mode from the others.
Production through Massive Vector Bosons (MVB), namely W +W −-, ZZ- or γZ-ini-
tiated processes, will also be neglected.1 The MVB processes are marginal to the present
study for two reasons. First, they are accompanied by the production of forward energetic
jets from the quark splitting, which are typically hard enough and not too forward to be
detected. MVB production is thus distinguishable from the partonic processes provided
suitable forward jet selection cuts are put in place. Notice that the situation is diﬀerent for
the γγ production mode because the photon is massless and thus the p⊥ of the emission is
only cut-oﬀ by the proton mass. The QCD jets from γγ fusion are thus softer than the MVB
ones and diﬃcult to detect. Actually, the γγ radiation pattern is even softer (and possibly
even consist, in the elastic scattering regime, of just two extremely forward protons) than
the one associated with the other partonic processes gg and qq, giving a possible handle to
pin it down [2]. The second reason to neglect the MVB processes is the fact that the photon
parton distribution function (PDF), again because of the lack of a hard low-p⊥ cut-oﬀ in
the photon splitting, is much larger than the MVB one.2 This makes MVB processes also
quantitatively marginal. An exception is the situation in which the couplings of R to MVB’s
are much larger than the γγ one, in which case, however, resonance searches in MVB ﬁnal
states are much more eﬀective.

On top of the analysis of the possible production channels, a full study of a resonant
diphoton process also requires a characterization of the cross section and kinematical dis-

1They could however be straightforwardly included relying on the Eﬀective W (or Z) Approximation

(EWA) [1], which allows to treat the MVB’s as partons.

2Notice that these considerations are qualitative because the photon PDF, diﬀerently from the ones of
MVB’s, cannot be computed from the splitting of quarks inside the proton. Quantitative conﬁrmations come
from a recent photon PDF calculation [3] and (large error) measurements [4].

tributions of the signal. Providing this characterization is the main aim of the present
paper. As we will discuss in details, our analysis allows to derive a simple phenomenological
parametrization that can be used to describe resonances with arbitrary (integer) spin and
CP parity, produced in any of the gg, qq and γγ partonic channels described above. For
deﬁniteness, although we will discuss our formalism in full generality, for the explicit ex-
amples we will focus on the commonly considered cases of resonances with spin J = 0 and
J = 2 and on a more exotic possibility, J = 3, which provides a peculiarly simple collider
phenomenology.

Our characterization of the diphoton signal is based on symmetries (see e.g. [5, 6] for
earlier references and [7, 8] for more recent ones) and is not new from the technical point
of view, since it closely follows the strategy employed for the experimental studies of the
Higgs boson J CP properties (see for instance ref. [9]). It however provides a new, simple and
comprehensive way to parametrize a possible signal excess in diphoton production, allowing
to encompass in a uniﬁed way the variety of theoretical origins of the intermediate resonance
R. Our approach is particularly convenient in scenarios that are diﬃcult to fully describe
through explicit models, as could be for a generic spin-2 resonance or for higher-spin states
(as for instance J = 3) which can not be described within an eﬀective Lagrangian formalism.
The framework, nevertheless, remains useful also in the simpler J = 0 case thanks to its
uniﬁed treatment of the various production channels.

The ﬁrst step for the characterization of the signal properties is the classiﬁcation of
the partonic cross sections. Due to the simplicity of the 2 → 2 scattering process, the only
relevant kinematic variable at the partonic level is the center-of-mass (COM) scattering angle
θ. The form of the partonic cross-section, namely its dependence on θ is strongly constrained
by angular momentum conservation. This observation allows to parametrize the decay
distributions of the resonance in terms of only 5 basis functions of θ, whose explicit form is
dictated by the resonance spin J. The number of independent basis functions decreases to 3
in the case of gg/γγ production and to 4 in the qq channels. Further simpliﬁcations emerge if
J is odd and, of course, if J = 0, in which case the 5 functions collapse to a constant leading
to the well-known result that scalars (or pseudo-scalars) decay in a spherically symmetric
way. The second step for the signal characterization is to convolute the partonic cross
section with the PDF’s which are appropriate for each partonic initial state. The PDF’s
aﬀect the overall signal normalization through the parton luminosity factor, which is of
course very diﬀerent for the various production modes. Moreover they considerably aﬀect
the dependence of the cross-section on the collider energy, which is a crucial information to
combine 8 and 13 TeV LHC searches. Finally, the PDF’s determine the distribution of the
COM rapidity in the laboratory frame, which in turns aﬀects the angular distributions of
the ﬁnal state photons. This opens up the possibility of distinguishing diﬀerent production
modes by diphoton distributions measurements.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce our framework along the lines
mentioned above, in a way that allows semi-analytical (because of the required PDF input)
calculations of the signal rate and distributions in terms of the parameters that control the
on-shell resonance production and decay Feynman amplitudes. The translation of the latter
parameters into eﬀective operator coeﬃcients, which straightforwardly allows to implement
our signal in an event generator in order to deal with QCD radiation and detector eﬀects, is
reported in Appendix A for J = 0 and J = 2 resonances. In the fully general case, in which
all the 7 production modes are active and no further assumption is made on the resonance

couplings, the proliferation of free parameters makes the problem untreatable. Therefore in
section 3 we deﬁne a set of representative benchmark scenarios, whose number and variety
should be suﬃcient to provide a wide enough coverage of the various phenomenological
options. These scenarios are analyzed by recasting, with a strategy described in Appendix B,
available 8 and 13 TeV experimental searches. Rather than aiming to fully quantitative
results, which might be only obtained by the experimental collaborations, the goal of this
study is to illustrate the usage of our benchmarks to characterize possible signals such as
the popular 750 GeV excesses. Still, we will be able to reach semiquantitative conclusions
on the viability of our scenarios. In section 4 we report our conclusions and a preliminary
assessment of the additional information which can be extracted from the study of initial
state radiation emission. A complete discussion of the latter point is left for future work.

2 General framework

We consider a resonance R of integer spin J, produced at the LHC out of a given 2-partons
initial state in = {gg, qq, qq, γγ} and decaying to γγ as depicted in ﬁgure 1.3 We start our
discussion from the fully polarized scattering process and denote by λ1 and λ2 the helicities
of the incoming partons, λ and λ(cid:48) those of the ﬁnal state photons. These helicities cannot
be measured at the LHC and we will eventually have to sum/average over them to obtain
the cross-section.4 Conservation of angular momentum along the beam direction implies
that only a single spin component of the resonance can contribute to the partonic process,
namely the one with spin projection m = λ1 − λ2 along the beam axis oriented in the
direction of parton “1”. Thus, the resonance production process can be fully described
by a set of dimensionless coeﬃcients Ain
which parametrize the corresponding Feynman
amplitudes as

A ([in]λ1,λ2→ Rm) = M Ain

λ1,λ2δm,λ1−λ2 ,

(1)

3Initial partons are ordered by the direction they come from, this is why qq and qq are distinct in states.
4We assume that it will never be possible to measure photon polarizations at the LHC and we restrict our
attention to inclusive γγ production. The exclusive case, in which we imagine having access to the radiation
from the initial state, is brieﬂy discussed in section 4.

in = gg or in = γγ and λ1,2 = ±1/2 for in = qq/qq. Correspondingly, only resonances
with m = 0,±2 and m = 0,±1 can be produced, respectively, in the bosonic and fermionic
channels. Not all the four complex coeﬃcients Ain
we have for each production mode are
independent. Invariance of the amplitudes under a π rotation in a direction orthogonal to
the beam implies

where in the ﬁrst equality we implicitly made use of the fact that the gg and γγ states are
made of indistinguishable particles.

In the case of the resonance production, which we discussed until now, the incoming par-
tons momenta are completely ﬁxed in the COM frame, thus it is trivial that the amplitudes
can be parametrized in terms of few constant coeﬃcients. The situation is diﬀerent for the
resonance decay process, which depends on the kinematical variables of the γγ ﬁnal state
and in particular on the COM scattering angle θ. Still, each polarized decay amplitude can
be parametrized by a single constant because the angular dependence is completely deter-
mined, and encapsulated in the so-called “Wigner d-matrices” dJ
m,m(cid:48)(θ) [10]. The point is
that by a rotation one can connect a γγ state with arbitrary polar and azimuthal angles θ
and φ to a photon pair moving along the beam axis and obtain the angular dependence of
the amplitude from the matrix elements of the rotation matrix among the resonance spin
eigenstates. The result reads (see for instance [7])

A(Rm → [γγ]λλ(cid:48)) = ei(m−λ+λ(cid:48))φdJ

m,λ−λ(cid:48)M · (−)J Aγγ−λ,−λ(cid:48) ,

(3)

where we made use of the CPT symmetry to relate (up to phases, which eventually produce
the (−)J factor) the amplitude coeﬃcients of the R → γγ decay to those associated with
the production process γγ → R. Therefore describing the resonance decay does not require
introducing new parameters.
The set of processes we are considering is thus fully characterized, taking into account
the relations in eq. (2), by a rather small number of parameters shown in table 1. Namely, we
have in general 4 complex parameters for the qq (and qq) production, 3 complex parameters
describing gg/γγ if J is even and only 1 complex parameter if J is odd. For J = 0, the
“+−” and “−+” amplitudes vanish and we are left with 2 complex parameters for gg/γγ
and again 2 for the qq channels. The case J = 1 is not worth discussing because the decay to
γγ (and the production from gg) is forbidden by the Landau-Yang theorem, or equivalently
by noting that also ag/γ
vanishes in this case (see table 1) because of angular momentum
conservation.

2

It is important to remark that the derivations above are completely model-independent
as they only rely on the invariance under rotations and CPT, which are symmetries of any
relativistic quantum theory of particles. In particular they do not rely on the CP symmetry,
therefore our results hold irregardless of the resonance CP-parity and even of whether CP
is at all a symmetry or not. If CP is a symmetry, we get the additional constraint

ones in the CP-odd case. Sizable tilded and untilded parameters would be simultaneously
present only if the CP symmetry was badly broken by the resonance couplings.

We stress that the “a” (and “(cid:101)a”) coeﬃcients in table 1 are, in general, complex numbers.5

However they become real when the resonance production/decay processes are induced by
heavy mediators. Establishing experimentally whether they are real or not would therefore
allow us to verify or falsify this hypothesis. In order to appreciate this claim, we notice that
if the resonance couplings are mediated by the exchange of heavy particles it is possible to
integrate them out, giving rise to a set of local operators (contact interactions) that induce
resonance production and decay. The heavy-mediator condition can thus be equivalently
formulated as the hypothesis that the production/decay amplitudes are well described by a
contact interaction at Born level, i.e. by the matrix element of a local Hermitian operator,
in which case the CPT symmetry, combined with eq. (2), gives a relation

It is easy to check that this condition implies that the a’s in table 1 are real. If instead
the resonance couplings are due to light particles loops, imaginary parts will arise in the
amplitudes, by the optical theorem, due to the propagation of on-shell intermediate states.
Establishing whether the a’s are real or not would thus give us relevant information on the
resonance dynamics. However, this will turn out to be impossible through the measurement
of unpolarized inclusive diphoton production distributions, which are our main target. In-
deed, restricting to real a’s is enough to span the whole variety of kinematical distributions
one would obtain even for general complex a’s. We will brieﬂy come back to this point in
section 4.

A priori, the parametrization of the resonance production and decay amplitudes pro-
vided in table 1 might still be redundant because they solely followed from rotation and

CPT invariance. In principle, further constraints might arise by requiring invariance of the
amplitudes under the complete Lorentz group. This is however not the case, as explicitly
shown in Appendix A for J = 0 and J = 2 resonances.6 In the Appendix, we classify all the
Lorentz-invariant terms, expressed as functions of the 4-momenta of the resonance and in
particles and of their polarization vectors or spinor wave functions, which can appear in the
polarized amplitudes. The coeﬃcients of these Lorentz-invariant terms are found to be in
one-to-one correspondence with the parameters in table 1, showing that no further restric-
tions emerge from imposing the full Lorentz symmetry. Moreover, Lorentz-invariant ampli-
tudes are easily mapped to Lorentz- and gauge-invariant operators and therefore another
result of the Appendix (see eq.s (31) and (32)) is to relate the phenomenological parameters
’s, to the couplings of a phenomenological Lagrangian.7 This is
required for the implementation of our parametrization in a multi-purpose event generator.
Consistently with the discussion following (5), if the phenomenological Lagrangian is taken
to be Hermitian (i.e. the only phenomenologically relevant states are R, in, γγ) the ampli-
tude coeﬃcients obey eq. (5) and the a’s are real, as expected. In the Appendix we focused
on J = 0 and J = 2 resonances because higher spin particles are anyhow not implemented
in multi-purpose event generators. Complete simulations for J ≥ 3, taking properly into
account soft QCD radiation, hadronization and detector eﬀect would thus require a diﬀerent
approach, based on matrix-element reweighting techniques as discussed in the next section.

2.1 Partonic cross sections

We are now in the position of constructing, with the amplitude coeﬃcients as building
blocks, the partonic unpolarized cross-section of the complete 2 → 2 reaction in → γγ.
This will allow us to identify the combinations of amplitude coeﬃcients that appear in the
unpolarized cross-section and will suggest a convenient phenomenological parametrization of
the signal, to be employed for the experimental characterization of the resonance properties.
The in → γγ Feynman amplitude is the product of the production and decay amplitudes,

times the Breit-Wigner propagator of the resonance

A(in → R → γγ) =

(cid:88)
m A(in → Rm)

ˆs − M 2 + iM ΓA(Rm → γγ) ,

(6)

where Γ is the total resonance width and ˆs is the partonic COM energy squared. The
Breit-Wigner propagator produces, in the amplitude squared, a factor of π/(ΓM ) times the
normalized Breit-Wigner distribution BW(ˆs). The partonic cross-section thus reads

= M 2BW(ˆs)

(7)

having reabsorbed in ¯σin some factors, and in particular the dependence on Γ. The second
equality in the equation holds for a narrow resonance, namely in the limit Γ/M → 0. In that
limit ¯σin assumes, as we will readily see, the physical meaning of the signal cross-section

6The case J = 3 has also been checked, but it is not discussed in the Appendix.
7Notice that the correspondence among the Lorentz-invariant terms in the (on-shell) amplitude decom-
position and the operators is not at all one-to-one. Namely, inﬁnitely many operators reduce, on-shell, to
a single term in the amplitude. The simplest set of operators, just suﬃcient to produce arbitrary on-shell
amplitudes, is selected in the Appendix.

for unit parton luminosity at the resonance mass, namely for [τ dLin/dτ ]|τ =M 2/s = 1. A
compact expression for d¯σin/d cos θ (see eq. (9) below) may be obtained as follows.
As previously explained, each polarized in → γγ process is mediated by a single reso-
nance spin m = λ1 − λ2. Therefore its angular dependence is ﬁxed by the Wigner formula
(3) to be the square of the associated Wigner matrix, [dJ
m,λ−λ(cid:48)]2. By summing the polarized
cross sections over m, λ and λ(cid:48) we obtain the unpolarized one, expressed as a sum of known
functions of the COM scattering angle θ weighted by the square of the corresponding polar-
ized production and decay amplitudes. The polarized production amplitudes can be traded
for the resonance production cross section, whereas the decay amplitudes can be traded for
the branching ratios.

In the sum, several terms can be grouped together by proceeding as follows. We ﬁrst

sum over the photons helicities λ and λ(cid:48) and notice that the ++ and −− terms in the
m,0]2, while the +− and −+ ones have identical
sum produce the same angular function, [dJ
coeﬃcients |Aγγ
+−|2 = |Aγγ−+|2 by eq. (2) and can thus be collected in a single term with
m,−2]2. This allows us to cast the double λ, λ(cid:48) sum into a
angular dependence [dJ
single sum over S = |λ − λ(cid:48)
m,−S]2. In order to
deal with the sum over the initial state polarizations λ1 and λ2 we exploit the property of
Wigner matrices dJ

The normalization factor in the deﬁnition of the D(J)
|m|,S(θ) functions is chosen to make them
normalized to unity in the integration domain cos θ ∈ [0, 1] (which is the appropriate one
since the ﬁnal state photons are indistinguishable particles). The above equation ensures
that terms in the λ1,2 sum with a given value of m = λ1 − λ2 have the same angular
dependence of those with the opposite value, so that the two can be grouped in a single
term. The double sum over the initial state polarization thus becomes a single sum over the
absolute value of m, |m| = 0, 1, 2.
Since S = 0, 2 ranges over two values and |m| = 0, 1, 2, six terms are present in the
sum, each characterized by its own angular distribution D(J)
|m|,S(θ). Notice however that only
four of the six terms can be simultaneously turned on in a given partonic process because
|m| = 0, 1 for in = qq and |m| = 0, 2 for in = gg/γγ. Nevertheless we will momentarily
retain the six of them for a more concise exposition.

The explicit form of the D’s is reported in table 2 for J = 0, J = 2 and J = 3. The result
is trivial for J = 0, where m = S = 0 and the angular distribution is ﬂat, while already for
J = 2, 3 all the D’s are non-vanishing and non-trivial. Notice however that D(J)

leading to only ﬁve independent distributions. Moreover, since the only viable values of

former case and four in the latter.8 For J = 2, the distributions relevant for gg/γγ and for

The cross-section for in = qq need not to be discussed explicitly because it is just identical to
the qq one by the second relation in eq. (2). The BR’s in eq. (9) are those for the resonance

decaying to a polarized diphoton pair with equal helicities λ = λ(cid:48) = ±1 for S = 0 and with

after angular integration) for S = 2 compensates for the fact that the ±± states are made of
indistinguishable particles and thus they have to be integrated over half of the solid angle.
Furthermore, the branching ratios, as apparent from the notation, do not depend on the
resonance spin m because of rotational invariance.

Eq.s (10), (11) and (12) provide the required map among the amplitude coeﬃcients and
the potentially observable quantities (σ’s and BR’s) that parametrize the partonic cross
section in eq. (9). We see that the observables depend on few combinations of the a and
In particular, no
information can be extracted on whether the a’s are real or complex, namely on whether
eq. (5) is satisﬁed or not, as previously mentioned.

The cross section parametrization in eq. (9) can be directly employed for the comparison
with experiments or, as we ﬁnd convenient to do for the analysis in section 3, rewritten in
a “probabilistic” format by factoring out the total resonance production cross section times
the total branching ratio to an unpolarized photon pair (BR), namely

is the probability for the produced resonance to have spin equal to |m| in absolute value
and to decay to a state of spin S. The last identity in eq. (14) has been obtained using
eq.s (10) and (12). The probabilistic format is useful as it allows to disentangle the total
signal rate from the normalized angular distribution, encapsulated in the P’s. Notice that
the P’s, precisely because they are probabilities, sum up to one.
2.2 LHC cross sections and distributions

It is conceptually straightforward to go from the partonic cross section, characterized by the
σ×BR and P parameters as in eq. (13) (or by eq. (9)), to LHC diﬀerential cross sections
or to event samples to be compared with the experimental data. The result will consist in
a linear combination of distributions or in an admixture of event samples, each generated
with its own “D” partonic distribution and weighted by the corresponding “P” probability.

Lagrangian in Appendix A implemented in MadGraph [11], turning on at each time the
couplings associated with a given “D”, or by matrix element reweighting, starting from
the simulation of a scalar and reweighting each event, with partonic scattering angle θ, by
D(θ). This latter approach is the only viable one for J > 2, where no multi-purpose event
generator implementation is available as previously mentioned.
For an accurate comparison with the data, properly taking into account soft QCD radia-
tion, hadronization and detector eﬀects one of the two strategies described above should be
adopted. For the illustrative purpose of the present paper, however, it is suﬃcient to stick
to purely leading order predictions, on top of which experimental eﬀects will be attached
as overall eﬃciency factors as described in the next section. This simple approach has the
advantage of producing semi-analytical formulas for the distributions from which we can get
an idea of which aspects of the signal properties are easier to extract from data.

Notice that cos θ ranges from 0 to 1 as the photons are indistinguishable.

Both cos θ and y are measurable and both the cos θ and y diﬀerential distributions contain
interesting and, to large extent, complementary information about the signal. Namely, the
cos θ distribution gives us direct access, at least if only one “in” channel is active in eq. (15),
to the partonic diﬀerential cross section, which in turn is related to the resonance spin as
previously discussed. It also provides partial information about the production mode, given

that the cos θ distributions, i.e. the D functions, can be diﬀerent if the resonance is produced
by the gg/γγ or by the qq initial state.9 It is instead unable to distinguish, for instance,
qq = uu from qq = dd as the D’s are the same in the two cases. The situation is basically
reversed for the diﬀerential distribution in y, which is insensitive to the details of the partonic
cross section and is entirely dictated by the production mode, which determines the shape
of dP/dy. Whether or not and how easily this may be exploited to distinguish diﬀerent
production mechanisms depends on how much diﬀerent the dP/dy’s are in the diﬀerent
cases. This is quantiﬁed in ﬁgure 3, for a resonance mass of M = 750 GeV (chosen in
preparation for the discussion of the next section) and √s = 13 TeV. We see that the two
valence quarks have slightly diﬀerent distributions, allowing in principle to distinguish uu
from dd. All the sea quark distributions are instead very similar, or even identical within the
uncertainties, and not far from the ones for gg and γγ. The plots in ﬁgure 3 are obtained by
the NNPDF23 nnlo as 0119 qed set of NNPDF2.3 [4] with a factorization scale of 750 GeV.
The uncertainties are obtained from the variance over the PDF replicas provided in the
PDF set. Scale uncertainties, quantiﬁed by varying the factorization scale, are found to be
negligible. This is valid for the “ordinary” partons g and q, but not for the photon, whose
PDF measurement is too bad to extract any quantitative information. The γγ luminosity is
thus taken from ref. [2], where it has been estimated from the theoretical calculation of the
photon PDF presented in refs. [3, 12]. Uncertainties in dPγγ/dy are not reported in ref. [2]
and consequently they do not appear in our plot.

We saw that cos θ and y diﬀerential distributions provide complementary information
about the signal, however because of the photon acceptance cuts it is not clear that the two
distributions can actually be disentangled experimentally and measured separately. While
performing separate measurements (possibly unfolding the experimental eﬀects) would facil-
itate the interpretation, allowing for instance to compare directly the cos θ distribution with
the shape of the D functions in ﬁgure 2, notice that the exact same amount of information
0,2 can appear in
both gg/γγ and in qq production. If this is the case, distinguishing the two channels requires looking at the
y distribution as we will readily discuss.

Before concluding this section and in preparation for the next one, where we will use
our framework for a ﬁrst characterization of the 750 GeV excess, we report in table 3 the
total parton luminosity at M = 750 GeV at the 13 and 8 TeV LHC and the gain, deﬁned
as the ratio of the 13 and 8 TeV cross sections, for each production mode. Contrary to
dP/dy, the uncertainties are now dominated by scale variation and is of order 10%. Two
set of results are reported in the table concerning the γγ channel. The ﬁrst one is based on
the theoretical prediction from Ref. [2], which we will employ in what follows. The second
one, subject to a large error, is obtained with the NNPDF2.3 [4] PDF set.

3 Benchmark scenarios

In the previous section we saw how the production of a resonance of arbitrary spin decaying
to γγ is conveniently parametrized, for each given in = gg/γγ/qq production channel, in
terms of a rather small number of phenomenological parameters with a sharply deﬁned
and intuitive physical meaning. However, being completely agnostic about the resonance
couplings would require taking all the production channels into account simultaneously,
with independent free parameters for each of the 7 (i.e., gg/γγ/qq = {uu, dd, cc, ss, bb}) in
states. This proliferation of parameters makes the problem untreatable in full generality
and obliges us to make additional assumptions in order to reduce the dimensionality of the
parameter space. A set of plausible restrictive assumptions is deﬁned in the present section,
producing a set of alternative benchmark scenarios. Each of these benchmarks contains a
small enough number of free parameters to be experimentally tested in full generality. The
variety of benchmarks should provide a suﬃcient (but still unavoidably partial) coverage of
the phenomenology. Additional benchmarks can be deﬁned, if needed, within our general
framework.

The benchmark scenarios can be used for exclusions, producing limits on σ×BR which
are more general and easier to reinterpret in speciﬁc models than those obtainable with the
habitual benchmarks of a scalar or of a J = 2 “RS graviton” resonance. More interestingly,
they can be used to characterize the properties of a new resonance that we might happen
to discover in the diphoton ﬁnal state. In the latter case, the SM p-value and other statis-
tical quantities aimed at assessing the actual existence and viability of the signal, could be
reported on the benchmark model parameter space. This will select the signal hypothesis
that best ﬁts the data and will give us information about the resonance spin and (see sec-
tion 4) CP properties. At a later stage, with enough data, it will be possible to measure

13

the parameters of the benchmark models, namely those that control the signal kinematical
distribution and the total σ×BR. The model-independent nature of our parametrization will
straightforwardly allow to translate these measurements into whatever the “true” resonance
model turns out to be.

A good fraction of the program outlined above is slightly premature, as a discovery still
has to come. However the M = 750 GeV excess reported by ATLAS [13] and CMS [14] with
13 TeV LHC data gives us the opportunity to practice, at least on some aspects of the signal
characterization strategy.10 We will do so by recasting ATLAS 13 TeV [13], CMS 13 TeV [14],
ATLAS 8 TeV [17] and CMS 8 TeV [18] experimental searches, with a procedure described in
Appendix B in detail. It suﬃces here to say that the recast is performed by reconstructing,
in the Gaussian approximation, the likelihoods associated to each experimental search from
the background-only p-value and the observed limit. The four searches are eventually treated
as statistically independent in the combination. The intrinsic inaccuracy of our statistical
method and our approximate treatment of the experimental eﬃciencies make our results
not fully quantitative. Moreover, the experimental searches we use are not optimized to
provide information about the angular distributions of the putative signal and thus they
are poorly sensitive to the resonance spin and production mode. Consequently our results
will often show a rather limited discriminating power within the parameter space of each
benchmark and among diﬀerent benchmarks. Most of what we will be able to tell will come
from the combination of 8 and 13 TeV searches because of the slightly diﬀerent gain factors
r (see table 3) in the total signal rate. Notice however that the situation would substantially
improve with dedicated experimental analysis and/or more data.

In view of the considerations above, we warn the reader that the results that follow
should be mostly regarded as a pragmatic illustration of the usage of our benchmarks.
Still, it will be interesting to see that in some cases the various analyses do display slightly
diﬀerent acceptances for the same signal shape, merely due to the slightly diﬀerent selection
cuts. This produces, in the combination, some discriminating power among the diﬀerent
hypotheses and indicates that progress in the signal characterization should be relatively
easy to achieve with a dedicated analysis.

3.1 Scalar resonance

As a ﬁrst case we consider the simplest scenario, that is the model with a scalar resonance.
This case is rather peculiar since the angular distribution of the two photons in the COM
frame is completely ﬂat. Indeed, as we saw in the previous section, the only contribution to
the production comes from the m = S = 0 mode, which is described by the angular function
D(0)
0,0 = 1 (see table 2). The only model-dependence is encoded in the relative strengths of the
various production channels, which can be parametrized through the partonic production
cross sections ¯σin. Such a parametrization characterizes the possible scenarios in a way that
is completely independent of the details of the experimental searches, in particular of the
COM energy of the collider. From a practical point of view, however, this does not seem a
convenient choice. Due to the extremely diﬀerent parton luminosities (see table 3), partonic
cross sections of similar size give rise to signal cross sections for the various production
channels that can diﬀer by more than one order of magnitude. For instance, the production

of axions decaying into highly collimated photons as suggested in ref. [15] (see also refs. [16]).

modes through quarks or photons can be comparable to the gg one only if their partonic
cross sections ¯σq ¯q/γγ are much larger than ¯σgg. Therefore, we ﬁnd more convenient to adopt
a parametrization that allows to eﬃciently treat cases in which various production modes
lead to comparable signal yields. Of course a parametrization of this kind is necessarily
collider dependent, since it must take into account the parton luminosities. A possible
choice, which we will adopt in the following, is to use the ratios of signal cross sections for
the various channels for a collider energy of 13 TeV. In particular we deﬁne the quantities

is the
total production cross section.11 The Rin parameters directly encode the relative importance
of the contributions to the signal cross section from the various production channels. Since
they are normalized to the total production cross section, the Rin parameters sum up to
in Rin = 1. The relative strengths of the production channels at 8 TeV can be easily
related to the 13 TeV ones by taking into account the change in the partonic cross sections
listed in table 3.

tot

From the experimental point of view, the various production channels are characterized
by the diﬀerent gain factors between the 8 and 13 TeV cross sections and by diﬀerent signal
acceptances for the experimental searches, possibly corresponding to diﬀerent event selection
categories. As can be seen from the numerical values in table 4, the geometric acceptances
for the various production channels are quite similar to each other. The most important
diﬀerences, of the order of ∼ 20%, are present for the CMS analysis, which explicitly presents
the results in two categories: barrel-barrel (EBEB), which includes events with both photons
in the central detector region, and barrel-endcap (EBEE), in which one photon is central
while the second falls in the detector endcap. As we discussed before, the various production
channels lead to slightly diﬀerent rapidity distributions for the ﬁnal photons, thus giving rise
to diﬀerent acceptances for the two CMS categories. Obviously this property cold be used
to diﬀerentiate the production channels, although at present the experimental sensitivity is
limited. We will discuss better this aspect in Appendix B.1.

11The branching ratio into diphotons is clearly the same for all channels and drops out in the ratio of the

signal cross sections.

Figure 4: On the left panel we show the reconstructed p-value for the background-only
hypothesis in the case of a narrow scalar resonance produced in the uu, dd and gg channels.
The results are obtained by combining the ATLAS and CMS 13 and 8 TeV searches. On
the right panel we show the best ﬁt of the 13 TeV signal cross section.

Let us start the description of the numerical results by considering the quark and gluon
production modes. The diﬀerence between the gg mode and the production through sea
quarks (ss, cc, bb) is very small. All these channels have comparable gain factors (see
table 3) and similar signal acceptances (see table 4). This is not unexpected, since the parton
luminosities for these production channels are quite similar (see ﬁg. 3). For this reason in
our recast we only consider the gg channel, which provides also a good approximation of
the sea quark ones. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences, instead, are present with respect to the valence
quark modes (uu and dd), mostly due to the gain factors that are much smaller than in
the gg case. In addition to the acceptances we also included some reconstruction eﬃciency
factors for the signal, which we take from the experimental papers. The numerical values
are 70% for ATLAS 13 TeV, 81% and 77% for the EBEB and EBEE categories of the CMS
13 TeV analysis, 56% for ATLAS 8 TeV and 81% for CMS 8 TeV. Finally, in our numerical
analyses we assume the resonance to have a small width, below the experimental resolution
∼ 7 GeV.
The local signiﬁcance of the diphoton excess is shown in the left panel of ﬁg. 4 as a
function of the Rgg, Ruu and Rdd parameters. Since these tree parameters sum up to one, it
is convenient to present the results in a “triangle” plot. One can see that the local p-value
is sensitive almost exclusively to Rgg, ranging from 4 σ in the case with purely gg-initiated
production (Rgg = 1) to 3.5 σ in the cases with Rgg = 0. The dependence on the other
two parameters is quite limited, since the gain and eﬃciencies for the uu and dd modes are
similar. The best ﬁt of the signal cross section is shown in the right panel of ﬁg. 4 and
ranges from 5 fb for the Rgg = 1 case to 3 fb for Rgg = 0.

In ﬁg. 5 we show the combined goodness of ﬁt (see Appendix B for more details). One
can see that the compatibility of the various searches is never high. In the best case Rgg = 1,
the compatibility is only ∼ 9%, while it drops below 1% in the uu and dd-initiated modes.
Analyzing the breakdown of the likelihood in each experimental search, one ﬁnds that the

major source of tension is the ATLAS 13 TeV search, which favors a quite large signal cross
sections ∼ 10 fb, to be compared with the much smaller ones ∼ 2 fb preferred by the other
three searches. On the other hand, the two CMS searches and the ATLAS 8 TeV one show a
very good compatibility ((cid:38) 30%). Obviously the better global agreement found in the case
of gg-initiated production is due to the larger gain factor between the 8 TeV and 13 TeV
cross sections.

As a ﬁnal case we consider the scenario in which the scalar resonance is produced ex-
clusively through the γγ mode.12 In this case there is no free parameter and the scenario is
fully characterized by the gain factor rγ = 2.9 and by the eﬃciencies given in table 4. The
eﬃciencies are quite similar to the ones for the dd initiated mode, thus we expect the overall
features of this scenario to be comparable to the case Rdd = 1. As we already discussed, the
relatively small gain factor increases the tension between the ALTAS 13 TeV results and
the other searches, thus the photon-initiated mode is not favored by the present data. The
goodness of ﬁt is indeed 1% and also the statistical signiﬁcance of the excess is relatively
small, 3.5 σ. The best ﬁt of the 13 TeV signal cross section is 3 fb.

3.2 Spin-2 resonances

Let us now move to the case of spin-2 states. As we did for the scalar resonances, we will
adopt here a broad perspective and we will consider a generic new state without imposing
any restriction on its production modes and on its decay distributions. When looking for a
physics interpretation of these scenarios, it must be however kept in mind that resonances of
spin J ≥ 2 have a typical interpretation as composite states. Therefore, the hypothesis that
a new state of this kind is within the reach of the LHC requires an exotic strong dynamics
not far above the TeV scale. Such a framework is considerably constrained by a variety of
experimental tests, which limit the number of realistic benchmark scenarios.

12For phenomenological analyses of this scenario see ref. [19].

As for the scalars, the production modes can be encoded in the Rin parameters deﬁned as
in eq. (19). In the present case, however, additional free parameters are needed to take into
account the angular distribution of the decay products. As we explained in Section 2, the
decay distributions in the COM frame are a combination of a limited number of functional
forms, which depend on the production channel (three forms for the gg and γγ mode and four
for the quark-initiated channels). The total number of free parameters is thus signiﬁcantly
greater than in the scalar-resonance case. It is thus unpractical to keep all of them free
in an analysis, but instead it is reasonable to consider a few benchmark scenarios. In the
following we will describe some of them. In particular we will focus on single production
modes, namely the gg initiated channel and the quark production modes. In addition we
will also discuss a benchmark that parametrizes a very speciﬁc, but well motivated scenario,
the Randall-Sundrum graviton.13

3.2.1

gg-initiated production

The most straightforward way to couple an exotic strong dynamics to the SM is via gauge
interactions. This is typically realized whenever the constituents of the resonance are charged
under the SM gauge symmetry.
If the strong sector is charged under QCD, the leading
production modes at hadron collider is expected to be the one involving gluons. Another
interesting possibility is the case in which the resonance is produced from photons.

Applying the results of section 2, it is straightforward to check that the COM angu-

lar distribution of the decay products is a combination of the functions D(2)
and D(2)

0,2, D(2)
2,0
2,0 (see table 2), we are left with just three possible

functional forms. We can thus fully parametrize the diﬀerential cross section as

13Extensions of this minimal framework have been recently discussed in [20].
14This result trivially follows from the fact that the gluons and the photons can only have helicities ±1,

thus they give rise to a combined state with m = +2, 0 − 2.

results are presented as a function of the parameters P00, P02 + P20 and P00, which encode

as a function of three free quantities, P00, P02 + P20 and P22, which are normalized such
that they sum up to unity.
As a representative example, we recast the experimental searches for a diphoton reso-
nance in the scenario with a narrow spin-2 resonance produced exclusively from gg. The
case of γγ production is similar, however, analogously to the scalar case, it is disfavored by
the current data because of the small cross section gain between 8 and 13 TeV.

The geometric acceptances for the various experimental searches are listed in table 5 (see
table 6 for the acceptances in the γγ channel). In ﬁg. 6 we show the signal signiﬁcance and
the best ﬁt of the cross section for the gg mode as a function of the three free parameters,
P00, P02 + P20 and P00. The goodness of the ﬁt is instead shown in ﬁg. 7. We ﬁnd that the
signal signiﬁcance is around 4 σ and is slightly higher for a resonance decaying in the D(2)
and D(2)
2,0 modes. The goodness of ﬁt in the P02 +P20 = 1 corner is ∼ 12% and is signiﬁcantly
higher that in the other conﬁgurations, in particular for P22 = 1 we ﬁnd a compatibility
around 4%. The best ﬁt of the signal cross section varies from ∼ 4 fb in the conﬁgurations
with P02 + P20 = 1 to ∼ 7 fb in the cases P00 = 1 and P22 = 1.
3.2.2

qq-initiated production

0,2

A spin-2 resonance can have sizable couplings to quarks if some of the latter mix signiﬁcantly
with fermionic composites of the exotic strong dynamics. We can thus envisage a scenario
in which a spin-2 resonance is produced mainly through the qq channel. In this set-up the
initial partons can have m = ±1 or m = 0. The latter spin, however, is only generated by
interactions suppressed by a chirality ﬂip, which thus are expected to give rise to smaller
contributions than the |m| = ±1 channel. For this reason we will neglect the m = 0 case in

In principle all quarks could couple to the new resonance. However in order to avoid
tensions with existing bounds we assume the resonance has negligible ﬂavor-violating cou-
plings to the light quarks. Plausible scenarios may be constructed if the coupling is either
family-universal or dominantly with the heavy quarks (in particular with the third gener-
ation).
In the ﬁrst the
spin-2 resonance couples dominantly to the bottom quark. In the second scenario it has
a family-universal coupling with a single quark representation (as, for instance, the right-
handed up-type quarks). We will assume that in both scenarios the unavoidable coupling
to gluons can be neglected.

In the following we will thus consider two benchmark scenarios.

The geometric acceptances for the various quark production channels are listed in table 7.
The signal signiﬁcance and the best ﬁt of the cross section for the bb production channel
is shown in ﬁg. 8 as a function of the P10 = 1 − P12 parameter. One can see that the
signiﬁcance is around 4 σ and the cross section best ﬁt is (cid:39) 5.5 fb. This scenario provides a
good compatibility among the experiments, at the level of 10−15%. The dependence on P10
is relatively mild due to the limited statistical precision currently available. As can be seen
from table 7, the acceptances for the two diﬀerent angular distributions diﬀer signiﬁcantly,
thus they could allow to better diﬀerentiate the various scenarios when more data will be
available.

The results for the scenario with universal couplings to the fermions are shown in ﬁg. 9.
In this case the cross section gain factor is mostly determined by the one of the valence
quarks and is given by runiv = 2.9. Due to the relatively small gain factor the signiﬁcance
in this scenario is lower than in the bb channel, namely it is around ∼ 3.5 σ. The best ﬁt for
the signal cross section is ∼ 3 fb. In this scenario the compatibility among the experiments

3.2.3 The RS graviton

We conclude the discussion of the spin-2 resonances by considering a well-known scenario
that includes a new state of this kind, the Randall-Sundrum (RS1) model. In this case the
spin-2 state is identiﬁed with the massive graviton of RS1, which is coupled to the stress
tensor of the SM. The particular form of the coupling implies a peculiar relation between
qq and gg production modes, namely σqq = σqq = 2
3 σgg. It also completely ﬁxes the angular
distributions of the diphoton ﬁnal state. In the notation introduced in the previous section
12 = 1. On top of ﬁxing the properties of the diphoton ﬁnal state, the RS1
scenario also determines the relative importance of the other decay channels of the massive
graviton. In particular it possesses large branching ratios into leptons, which suggests that
diphoton searches are probably not competitive with di-leptons for this speciﬁc scenario.
Taking into account the implications of the other ﬁnal states, however, goes beyond the
scope of this paper, thus we just concentrate on the diphoton channel.

22 = P qq

The geometric acceptance for the RS1 graviton are listed in table 8, while the gain factor
between the 8 and 13 TeV cross section is mostly determined by the gg production mode
and is equal to rRS = 4.1. We ﬁnd that the available searches imply a statistical signiﬁcance
of 3.8 σ for a graviton with a mass 750 GeV, with a compatibility of the diﬀerent searches
at the 3% level. The best ﬁt of the signal cross section is 5 fb.

The results are presented as a function of the parameter P10 = 1 − P12, which encodes

panel we show the best ﬁt of the 13 TeV signal cross section. In the lower panel we plot the
goodness of ﬁt.

3.3 Spin-3 resonances

As a last benchmark scenario we discuss the case of spin-3 resonances. From table 1, one
sees that for a resonance of odd spin produced through gg or γγ only the channels |m| = 2
are allowed. Therefore the most general gg/γγ cross sections can be written in terms of a
single parameter

4 Conclusions and outlook

In this paper we provided a general characterization of the resonant diphoton production
at hadron colliders. Our main result is the derivation of a new, simple phenomenological
parametrization that can be used to describe resonances with arbitrary (integer) spin and
CP parity, produced in any of the gg, qq and γγ partonic channels. By exploiting angular
momentum conservation, the decay distributions of the resonance can be expressed as a

the diphoton pair in the COM frame. The form of the basis functions is fully determined
by the spin of the resonance. Their relative importance in the signal distributions, as well
as the relative importance of the various production channels, are controlled by polarized
resonance cross sections and decay branching ratios.

An important advantage of our parametrization is the fact that it does not depend on any
assumption about the underlying theory describing the resonance. In particular it can be
used even if the resonance dynamics can not be encoded into a local eﬀective Lagrangian,
which could be the case if it emerges from a strongly-coupled QCD-like dynamics. Our
approach is thus completely model-independent and particularly suitable to describe in an
unbiased way a possible signal observed in the diphoton channel. Although mainly aimed at
characterizing a possible signal, our parametrization can also be used to express exclusions
in the case of a measurement compatible with the background-only hypothesis.

As an example of the use of our results, we performed a simple recast of the ATLAS and
CMS resonant diphoton searches, which recently reported an excess around an invariant
mass M = 750 GeV. These recasts should not be interpreted as fully quantitative results,
but rather as an illustration of the usage of our parametrization. For deﬁniteness we focused
on a few benchmark scenarios with resonances of spin J = 0, J = 2 and J = 3.

The J = 0 case is particularly simple, since the diphoton angular distribution is ﬁxed
to be completely ﬂat in the COM frame. The properties of the resonance thus only depend
on the relative importance of the various partonic production channels. Each channel is
characterized by the gain ratio between the 8 and 13 TeV production cross section and by
the acceptances in the various searches, which depend on the y distribution. We found that
the gg, ss, cc and bb channels are quite similar and diﬃcult to distinguish experimentally.
The situation is instead diﬀerent for the uu, dd and γγ channels, which have a signiﬁcantly
smaller gain ratio with respect to the gg mode. The present data show some degree of
tension between the 8 TeV results and the 13 TeV ones, in particular the ATLAS analysis,
which prefers large gain ratios. As a consequence the gg or heavy-quarks production modes
are favored. In this cases a good signal signiﬁcance, ∼ 4σ, is found with a 9% compatibility
among the various searches. The compatibility is instead poor, around 1%, in the case of
the light-quarks or γγ production modes.

production with the D(2)

Since they can lead to diﬀerent non-trivial angular distributions for the diphoton pair,
spin-2 resonances are characterized by a more varied phenomenology. Also in this scenario
production channels, as the gg one, with large gain ratios are preferred. Moreover more
central angular distributions are slightly favored since they lead to a higher acceptance,
In the most favorable case, namely gg
especially in the 13 TeV searches (see table 5).
0,2 angular distribution, a signal signiﬁcance of ∼ 4.2σ is found with
a compatibility of 12% between the various searches. Another scenario that has a good
compatibility with the data is the case of bb-initiated production, which can lead to an
overall compatibility of 15%. Another spin-2 benchmark we considered is the case of a
Randall-Sundrum massive graviton.
In this scenario the production mode is dominantly
2,2, which leads to a more
forward diphoton distribution. This property implies a not so good compatibility with the
data, at the 3% level.

gg and the angular distribution is described by the function D(2)

As a ﬁnal scenario we considered a spin-3 resonance produced in the gg channel. This

24

set-up is particularly simple since it is characterized by a single angular function, D(3)
2,2. In
this case we ﬁnd a good signiﬁcance ∼ 4.2σ and a good compatibility among the various
searches, ∼ 14%.
Besides providing the general framework within which benchmark scenarios can be de-
ﬁned, the phenomenological analysis presented in section 2 allows us to draw interesting
conclusions concerning which properties of the resonance (once it is discovered) could be
extracted from a careful experimental study of the resonant diphoton signal. Namely, we
saw that the resonance spin and production mode could be established, barring peculiar
degeneracies which we have identiﬁed, from the combined measurement of the cos θ and y
distributions. Within a given hypothesis for the resonance spin and production mode, the
cos θ distribution also gives us information about the resonance CP-parity.
Indeed non-

vanishing A±∓ amplitudes (recall that the a’s in table 1 are CP-even while the (cid:101)a’s are

CP-odd), which we could detect through the presence of a D1,S or D2,S component in the
angular distribution, would imply either that the resonance is CP-even or that CP is badly
broken by the resonance couplings. If instead A±∓ were to vanish, we would not be able to
only way to achieve this would be to measure a0 and(cid:101)a0 separately, but this is impossible
distinguish a CP-odd R from a CP-even resonance with accidentally vanishing a1,−1,2. The
since only a combination of the two enters, through eq. (11), in the diﬀerential cross section.
This problem is particularly severe for J = 0, where A±∓ = 0 by spin conservation and thus
the resonance CP-parity cannot be measured.

A possible way out is to study, as pointed out in refs. [2, 21] for the J = 0 case, the
structure of the forward initial state radiation (ISR) that unavoidably accompanies the hard
resonance production process. Consider the emission of two forward ISR jets 15 emitted in
the forward and backward direction, respectively, and denote by ϕ1 and ϕ2 their azimuthal
angles. For p⊥(j1,2) (cid:28) M , the Feynman amplitude for the complete 2 → 4 process takes
the form [22]

where φ is the azimuthal angle of the hard scattering plane, i.e. the one of the diphoton
pair appearing in eq. (3). The eiλϕ factors from the parton splittings are dictated by
momentum conservation, as discussed in ref. [22] for the case of eﬀective massive vector
bosons splittings. The gλ1,2’s are given functions, speciﬁc of the ISR splitting process at
hand, of the incoming partons momentum fractions x1,2. The above formula illustrates that
by studying the kinematical distributions of the ISR jets one can get more information about
the polarized resonant production amplitudes than that obtainable from the 2 → 2 process.
Taking for simplicity the soft limit, in which the most singular g-functions (i.e., those for
gg, qg, and qq splittings) become independent of λ, one easily obtains an approximate
formula for the complete 2 → 4 process cross section. Such a cross section, diﬀerential in
the azimuthal angular diﬀerence between the two jets, ϕ12 = ϕ1 − ϕ2, and integrated over

to one if the a’s and (cid:101)a’s are real. However |A++|/|A−−| = 1 is also ensured by the CP

for, respectively, gg/γγ and qq hard production. We deﬁned δ = arg(A++/A−−). Because
according to table 1 a CP-even (CP-odd) resonance has δ = 0 (δ = π), we see that measuring
the ϕ12 distribution one would be able to infer the resonance CP-parity, even for J = 0.
The distribution can also tell us if the a’s in table 1 are complex, which would mean that
the resonance interactions are mediated by loops of light particles as we discussed around
eq. (5). Indeed, it might allow to extract the ration |A++|/|A−−|, which is necessarily equal
symmetry, therefore observing |A++|/|A−−| (cid:54)= 1 would also mean that CP is broken.
Another process which is worth considering, because of its larger rate, is the emission of
a single detectable forward jet, with azimuthal angle ϕj. In this case one must study the
doubly diﬀerential distribution in cos θ and in ϕ = ϕj − φ, i.e. the angle between the jet
and the diphoton plane. The angular dependence, focusing once again on the soft/collinear
limit and assuming for simplicity a heavy mediator (real a’s), is controlled by

emission previously discussed, studying the single ISR jet distribution does not furnish
conclusive information about the resonance CP-parity at J = 0 because the dependence
on ϕ disappears in the scalar case. Still, the measurement of this process gives access to
diﬀerent parameter combinations which do not appear in the fully inclusive 2 → 2 reaction
and thus it is nevertheless worth studying.
A detailed analysis of the ISR radiation pattern, and its potential implications for the

experimental characterization of the resonance properties, is left for future work.

A On-shell amplitudes

In this appendix we will derive the eﬀective couplings that parametrize the on-shell dynamics
of a spin-0 or spin-2 resonance decaying into a photon pair. We will ﬁrst compute the on-shell
amplitudes for the production of R, from which the Ain
immediately follow. The analogous
amplitudes for R → γγ can be straightforwardly obtained from them. In section A.3 we
will then present an eﬀective Lagrangian that may be employed to implement the relevant
processes into a Montecarlo generator.

1 and pµ

The amplitudes for in → R depend only on a few basic quantities. First of all they
are a function of the 4-momenta of the initial partons, which we denote by pµ
2 . For
later convenience, we introduce the notation pµ = pµ
2 for the resonance momentum
and qµ = pµ
2 for the other independent combination of the initial momenta. The only
non-trivial Lorentz scalar is given by the resonance mass, p2 = −q2 = M 2. The amplitudes
also depend on the polarization vectors µ
1,2 (for gg/γγ production) and the spinors u1 and
v2 of the SM quarks (for qq production). In the case of a spin-2 resonance, an additional
tensor tµν is present, that describes the polarization of R.
Since the external states are on-shell, the equations of motion may be used to simplify
the expressions. Speciﬁcally, the polarization tensor tµν of a spin-2 resonance is required to
satisfy the same conditions as an on-shell spin-2 ﬁeld, i.e. to be transverse and symmetric-
traceless. This implies that its contraction with pµ vanishes and the only non-trivial terms
can be obtained by contractions with qµ and µ
1,2. Similarly, the equations of motion for
the SM quarks can be used to remove factors of γµpµ
from the amplitudes relevant to qq
i
production. Furthermore, because of the transversality of the gauge bosons µ
i pi µ = 0 may
be used to simplify the expressions for γγ, gg production and γγ decay. Finally, Lorentz
invariance constrains the form of the amplitudes for gg, γγ → R (and analogously R → γγ)
in a non-trivial way, by forcing them to be invariant under a shift µ

necessarily transversely polarized) and respecting the oﬀ-shell Ward identities. This allowed

and check that the squared amplitudes thus obtained agree with the ones derived from the
helicity amplitudes and the general formalism of section 2. For completeness we will present
our results in this oﬀ-shell form.

In the following we will specialize the discussion to the J = 0 and J = 2 cases, although
resonances with higher spin can be treated analogously. Our results agree with ref. [8] up
to phase conventions.

A.2 Spin-2 resonance

We can now discuss the scenario with a spin-2 resonance. In this case there are two diﬀer-
ences with respect to the spin-0 state. First, the amplitude will depend on the polarization
tensor of the resonance tµν. Second, the amplitudes for gg/γγ → R, which according to
the rules described above may contain terms that are anti-symmetric in the exchange of the
incoming state particles, must be symmetrized since the two gauge bosons are indistinguish-
able.

B Statistical treatment

In this appendix we brieﬂy describe the statistical procedure we used to obtain the numerical
results for the benchmark scenarios presented in section 3. For our recast we followed a
simple strategy to reconstruct the proﬁle likelihood ratio of the various searches (q(µ), where
µ is the signal strength parameter) by exploiting the available data, namely the p-value of
the background-only hypothesis and the exclusion limits on the signal cross section.

The p-value is directly connected to the value of the proﬁle likelihood ratio for a vanishing

signal hypothesis q(µ = 0). In the asymptotic limit, q follows a half-χ2 distribution [26],

f (q) =

(33)

and the background-only p-value corresponds to the cumulative distribution starting at
q(µ = 0).16 From the exclusion limits, instead, one can reconstruct the value of the cross
signal strength µ for which the cumulative distribution is equal to the exclusion threshold.
These elements are enough to reconstruct the proﬁle likelihood if we assume that a Gaussian
approximation is valid. In this case the proﬁle likelihood is just a quadratic polynomial in µ,
that is always positive and vanishes in a single point, i.e. for µ equal to the signal strength
best ﬁt ˆµ.17 Notice that with our procedure we are only able to extract the global likelihood
ratio for each experiment, but we have no access to the likelihood for the single event
categories used in the experimental analysis. For instance in the CMS 13 TeV analysis two
categories are considered which could give some information on the angular distribution of
the diphoton events. Due to the limited statistics, however, this information is not extremely
signiﬁcant and our approximate results are reliable. We will discuss this point quantitatively
in subsection B.1.

The above procedure can be straightforwardly applied to the CMS 8 and 13 TeV analyses
and to the ATLAS 13 TeV one, which provide the p-value and the exclusion limits as a
function of the diphoton system invariant mass for the case of a narrow-width resonance. In
the recast it is important to take into account the fact that the CMS results are provided for
a scenario with a RS graviton, while ATLAS consider the case of a scalar resonance. This
implies diﬀerent acceptances and reconstruction eﬃciencies as we discussed in section 3. For
the ATLAS 8 TeV search, on the other hand, only the exclusion limits are publicly available.
In this case we reconstructed the proﬁle likelihood by estimating the width of the 1 σ and
2 σ bands from the expected exclusion limits. Since in this search the data show only a very
mild (below 1 σ) excess, our estimate is expected to be fairly accurate. We also checked
that this procedure is correct by using the CMS 8 TeV data, in which case we ﬁnd that the
reconstructed likelihood is very close to the one obtained with the other method we used.

Once the likelihood ratios for the various searches are reconstructed, it is straightforward
to use them to extract the best ﬁt of the signal strength ˆµ and the combined signal sig-

16Notice that the ATLAS collaboration in the analysis of the 13 TeV data used a slightly diﬀerent procedure,
the uncapped p-value. This deﬁnition, however, coincide with the usual one if the best ﬁt of the cross section
is for µ > 0. This is always the case if there is an excess in the data, as it happens in the available ATLAS
and CMS 8 and 13 TeV searches for mγγ ∼ 750 GeV.

17This procedure is correct in the case in which an excess is present in the data, in which case necessarily
ˆµ > 0. In the case of a deﬁcit of events the signal strength best ﬁt would be negative ˆµ < 0, but the proﬁle
likelihood is deﬁned in such a way to vanish for µ = 0. In this case the knowledge of the background-only
p-value and of the exclusion limit is not enough to fully reconstruct the likelihood ratio.

niﬁcance, i.e. the p-value of the background-only hypothesis. Another interesting quantity
that can be computed is the compatibility among the various searches, also known as the
“goodness” of the ﬁt [27]. To extract this quantity one compares the likelihood for the best
ﬁt of the cross section with the one obtained by assuming independent signal strengths for
each experimental search. The resulting likelihood follows a χ2 distribution with a number
of degrees of freedom equal to the number of experiments minus one.

As an application of our recast procedure we show in ﬁg. 10 the statistical signiﬁcance
of the signal for the scenario with a narrow scalar resonance produced in the uu, gg and bb
channels. In the plots the p-values for the single searches are shown as a function of the
resonance mass, together with the result for the combination of the 13 TeV searches only
and the full combination of the 8 and 13 TeV data. One can see that the signiﬁcance of the
full combination for M (cid:39) 750 GeV is quite close to the one of the 13 TeV only searches if
the resonance is produced in channels with a large cross section gain between 8 and 13 TeV,
namely the gg and bb modes. This shows that in these scenarios the agreement between
the 8 TeV and the 13 TeV data is reasonably good. On the contrary, in the uu case, the
p-value for the full combination is signiﬁcantly smaller than the one for the 13 TeV searches
only, implying a sizable degree of tension among the experimental searches. These results
conﬁrm what we found in section 3.

Finally in ﬁgs. 11 and 12, we provide the ﬁt of the signal for the scenario with narrow

B.1

Impact of the CMS 13 TeV categories

As we saw in the section 3, the impact of the angular distribution on the various searches
can be signiﬁcant, even if we only consider the total number of events without explicitly
looking at the distributions. The reason for this dependence is the fact that relatively hard
cuts are imposed on the signal, with the aim of selecting events in which the ﬁnal-state
photons are central. As a consequence angular distributions that enhance the signal in the
central region of the detector have larger acceptances than the ones that give rise to a more
forward signal.

More details on the angular distribution can in principle be obtained by looking at the
diﬀerent signal categories used in the experimental analyses. In particular the CMS 13 TeV
study splits the events in two categories: the EBEB in which both photons are in the
barrel of the detector (|η| < 1.44) and EBEE in which one photon is in the barrel while
the second is in the endcap (|η| ∈ [1.57, 2.5]).19 The two categories allow to get a rough
information on the angular distribution, thus improving the discrimination power for the
diﬀerent benchmark models. Unfortunately, the procedure we described in the previous
section to recast the experimental analyses did not allow us to take into account separately

18See for instance refs. [28] for other works resenting a combination of the experimental results and a ﬁt

of the signal cross section and signiﬁcance in the scalar resonance scenario.

19The CMS 8 TeV analysis also considers 4 categories separating events in which the photons are in the
barrel and in the endcap. However, the distribution of the events in each category is not provided in the
experimental paper, so that we can not fully recast the analysis as we are dong for the 13 TeV case.

the diﬀerent categories. We now want to estimate how drastic this simpliﬁcation is and how
much a full analysis could help in discriminating the angular distribution of the diphoton
signal.

For this purpose, here we implement a simple recast of the CMS 13 TeV search.20 We
reconstruct the likelihoods associated to the two event categories by using the distributions
of events provided in ﬁg. 3 of ref. [14]. We assume that in each bin the events follow a
Poisson distribution and we construct the total likelihood by multiplying the likelihoods for
each bin. We model the background using the functional form given in the experimental
paper

f0(mγγ) = N e−p1mγγ m−p2

γγ ,

(34)
where p1,2 are free parameters and N is the overall normalization which we ﬁt together with
the other parameters. For simplicity we only focus on the narrow resonance scenario, and
we model the signal by a Gaussian distribution with a half width equal to the experimental
resolution (10 GeV for the EBEB category and 16 GeV for the EBEE category). The signal
and the background are ﬁtted simultaneously for each signal strength hypothesis. The test
statistics we use is based on the proﬁle likelihood ratio and the background-only p-value is
computed by assuming that the distribution is asymptotically equal to a half-χ2 distribution
with one degree of freedom.

The result of our recast is shown in Fig. 13, where we plot the signiﬁcance of the signal as
a function of the acceptance in the EBEB category AccEBEB under the assumption that the
total acceptance is equal to 1. One can see that the statistical signiﬁcance of the signal has
a non-negligible dependence on the angular distribution. In particular the signal is mostly
present in the EBEB category, so that models with a more central signal distribution are

preferred. The present experimental sensitivity, however, is not very large, so that the impact
on the ﬁt in the benchmark models we considered is mild. This justiﬁes our approximation
of combining the two CMS 13 TeV categories.21

21Notice that the signal signiﬁcance we ﬁnd in our recast is always lower than the one found by the
CMS collaboration. This can be explained by the fact that CMS made a ﬁt by using the unbinned event
distributions, whereas we only have access to the binned ones.
