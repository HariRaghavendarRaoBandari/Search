Abstract

1

First, we prove tight bounds of n2

(t−2)! α(n)t−2 ±O(α(n)t−3) on the ex-
tremal function of the forbidden pair of ordered sequences (123 . . . k)t
and (k . . . 321)t using bounds on a class of sequences called (r, s)-
formations. Then, we show how an analogous method can be used
to derive similar bounds on the extremal functions of forbidden pairs
of 0 − 1 matrices consisting of horizontal concatenations of identical
identity matrices and their horizontal reﬂections.

Introduction

A generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequence that avoids the sequence u is a
sequence that has no subsequence isomorphic to u. Generalized Davenport-
Schinzel sequences have a wide range of applications in mathematics. They
have been used to bound the complexity of the lower envelope of a set of
polynomial curves in the plane [4], as well as the maximum number of edges
in k-quasiplanar graphs on n vertices with no pair of edges intersecting in
more than O(1) points [2, 5].

Related extremal problems have also been studied for 0-1 matrices. Ex-
tremal problems for 0-1 matrices correspond to extremal problems about
ordered bipartite graphs. The maximum number of ones in a 0-1 matrix
avoiding a 0-1 matrix pattern P is the same as the maximum number of edges
in an ordered bipartite graph with vertex sets {1, . . . , n} and {n + 1, . . . , 2n}

1

avoiding a certain ordered bipartite graph pattern P ′ [13]. Extremal func-
tions of 0-1 matrices have also been used to ﬁnd the shortest rectilinear path
in a grid with obstacles [10], which has applications to robot navigation.
F¨uredi also used the extremal function to determine an upper bound on the
maximum number of unit distances in a convex n-gon [6].

1.1 Deﬁnitions and Results

Deﬁnition 1. For a sequence S of letters, let |S| denote the length of S, and
||S|| denote the number of distinct letters in S. The sequence S contains
another sequence u if some subsequence of S is isomorphic to u. S avoids u
if it does not contain u. The unordered extremal function, which we denote
exu(v, n), is the maximum length of a ||v|| − sparse sequence with n distinct
letters that avoids v. For a family F of sequences with the same number
of distinct letters, we deﬁne exu(F, n) to be the maximum length of such a
sequence that avoids all sequences in F .

Deﬁnition 2. An ordered sequence is a set of symbols with an ordering;
for convenience, we will use numbers. A sequence S order-contains another
sequence u if some subsequence of S is isomorphic to u, by means of an
isomorphism that preserves order. For convenience, we simply use contain
and avoid if it is clear we are referring to ordered sequences. The ordered
extremal function exo(P, n) is the maximum length of a ||u||−sparse sequence
with n distinct letters that order-avoids u. For a f amily F , exo(F, n) is the
maximum length of such a sequence that order-avoids all sequences in F .

Deﬁnition 3. An (r, s)-formation is a concatenation of s permutations on
the same r symbols. Let ζr,s(n) be exu(Fr,s, n), where Fr,s is the set of all
(r, s)-formations.

Agarwal, Sharir, Shor, and Hart proved most of the lower bounds for
ζr,s(n) [1, 9], but we only use the upper bounds in this paper. Pettie sharp-
ened the bounds and extended them to doubled (r, s)-formations [12].

Deﬁnition 4. A j-fat permutation on r symbols is a sequence with r dis-
tinct letters and j occurrences of each letter. A j-tuple (r, s)-formation is a
concatenation of s j-fat permutations on the same r symbols. Let Φr,s(n) be
exu(F Fr,s, n), where F Fr,s is the set of all r-tuple (r, s)-formations.

Nivasch [11] and Pettie [12] proved the upper bounds on ζr,s(n) and Φr,s(n)

for r ≥ 3.

where t = (cid:4) s−3

r and s.)

For unordered sequences, the (r, s)-formation upper bounds have been
used to provide a generalized bound on the extremal functions of all se-
quences: For a sequence u, exu(u, n) ≤ ζr,s−r+1, where r = ||u|| and s = |u|
[11].

In [7], a function of sequences called formation width (f w) was deﬁned so
that f w(u) is the minimum s for which there exists r such that every (r, s)-
formation contain u. The paper showed that f w((abc . . .)t) = 2t − 1 and
(t−2)! α(n)t−2 ±O(α(n)t−3). This result implied an improved
exu((abc . . .)t, n) = n2
upper bound on the maximum number of edges in k-quasiplanar graphs with
no pair of edges intersecting in more than O(1) points.

1

In this paper, we apply (r, s)-formations to bound extremal functions
of forbidden pairs of ordered sequences. The bounds on ζr,s(n) apply to
ordered (r, s)-formations as well. Using this, in Theorem 2.1 of our paper,
we prove the following: Let σ1 = (123 . . . k)t and σ2 = (k . . . 321)t. Then
exo({σ1, σ2}, n) = n2

(t−2)! α(n)t−2 ±O(α(n)t−3).

Deﬁnition 5. A 0-1 matrix A contains another P if some submatrix of A
can be transformed into P by possibly changing some ones to zeroes. A
avoids P if it does not contain P . Denote ex(P, n) as the maximum number
of ones an n × n 0-1 matrix that avoids P can have. For a f amily F , let
ex(F, n) be the maximum number of ones in such a matrix that avoids every
element of F .

We use an analogue of (r, s)-formations in 0−1 matrices to prove a similar

result for forbidden pairs of 0 − 1 matrices.

Deﬁnition 6. For an ordered sequence S deﬁne χ(S) to be the corresponding
0-1 matrix where the only 1-entry in column c is in the row number in spot

3

c of S. For example,

χ(12323) = 


1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 1




This is an intuitive correspondence because if sequence a contains se-

quence b, then χ(a) will contain χ(b).

Deﬁnition 7. Deﬁne a permutation matrix (r, s)-formation as a concatena-
tion of s r × r permutation matrices, or χ(a), where a is an ordered sequence
(r, s)-formation. For a given r, s let Gr,s be all permutation matrix (r, s)-
formations. Denote ex(Gr,s, n) as λr,s(n).

Cibulka, Kyncl, and Pettie [3, 12] proved bounds that imply upper bounds
on the extremal function of the family of permutation matrix (r, s)-formations.

Deﬁnition 8. Let a B-f at r × r permutation matrix be a matrix with r
rows in which every row has B ones. Let an (r, s)-B-fat be a matrix of s
horizontally concatenated r × r B-f at permutation matrices. Let Hr,s be the
set of all (r, s)-r-fats for a given r, s, and let Γr,s(n) = ex(Hr,s, n).

Cibulka and Kyncl used bounds on Γr,s(n) to ﬁnd bounds on the max-
imum size of permutations with VC-dimension k for a given k [3]. The
following bounds on λr,s(n) follow trivially from the bounds on Γr,s(n) in
[3, 12], where t = (cid:4) s−3
2 (cid:5):

λr,s(n), Γr,s(n) ≤

if s ≤ 3
if s = 4
if s odd, s ≥ 5
if s even, s ≥ 6.

In Theorem 3.1, we bound ex({A, B}, n) where A is a concatenation of
identical identity matrices, and B is the horizontal reﬂection of A. The
bounds are especially interesting in the case that A and B are both the
concatenation of exactly two matrices, since in this case ex({A, B}, n) =
Θ(n).

2 Sequence Results

We ﬁrst note the following trivial lemma.

Lemma 2.1. Let Fr,s be the family of ordered (r, s)-formations for a given r
and s. Then, exo(Fr,s, n) = exu(Fr,s, n) = ζr,s(n). Consequently, the bounds
in Theorem 1.1 still apply.

Any sequence or family of sequences that is guaranteed to be contained
in every (r, s)-formation for a given r and s has extremal function at most
ex(Fr,s, n). This is the guiding principle behind our subsequent proofs.

Lemma 2.2. If σ1 = (123 . . . k)t and σ2 = (k . . . 321)t, then f w({σ1, σ2}) =
2t − 1 for k ≥ 2.

Proof. The lower bound follows since f w((ab . . .)t) = 2t − 1. The upper
bound follows from a result in [7]. Let a binary (r, s)-formation be an
(r, s)-formation in which every permutation is 1 . . . r or r . . . 1. For γ suﬃ-
ciently large, every (γ, s)-formation contains a binary (r, s)-formation. Thus
f w({σ1, σ2}) ≤ 2t − 1 by the pigeonhole principle.

If F denotes the family of ordered sequences that are isomorphic to
(1 . . . k)t, then exo(F, n) = exu((1 . . . k)t, n). However, exo((1 . . . k)t, n) >
exu((1 . . . k)t, n).

In the next theorem, we show that only 2 of the k! permutations of
1, . . . , k are necessary for the ordered sequence extremal function to be within
a constant factor of the unordered sequence extremal function. Speciﬁcally,
exo({(1 . . . k)t, (k . . . 1)t} , n) = Θ(exu((1 . . . k)t, n)).

Theorem 2.1. If σ1 = (1 . . . k)t and σ2 = (k . . . 1)t, then exo({σ1, σ2}, n) =
n2

(t−2)! α(n)t−2 ±O(α(n)t−3) for k ≥ 2 and t ≥ 3.

1

Proof. The upper bound follows from Lemma 2.2. The lower bound follows
from the lower bound on exu((abc . . .)t, n).

Note that the value of r is not important, since in the bounds for ζr,s(n),

r only aﬀects the constant factor; only the value of s is signiﬁcant here.

In order to derive a more general corollary, we introduce two more deﬁ-

nitions.

Deﬁnition 9. If u is a sequence, then df w(u) is the minimum s for which
there exists r such that every r-tuple (r, s)-formation contains u.

5

Below we deﬁne reduced sequences to simplify the calculation of df w(u).

Deﬁnition 10. If u is a sequence or family of sequences, then red(u) is
the result of replacing every block of adjacent same letters in u with one
occurrence of the letter.

The next lemma follows trivially from Lemma 1.2 in [12].

Lemma 2.3. df w(u) = f w(red(u)) for all sequences u

Observe that the last lemma can be used to generalize the bounds in

Theorem 2.1.

Lemma 2.4. If σ1 = (1 . . . k)t and σ2 = (k . . . 1)t, then let γi for i = 1, 2
be obtained from σi by replacing every letter with j adjacent copies of itself.
Then df w({γ1, γ2}) = 2t − 1.

Corollary 2.1. If σ1 = (1 . . . k)t and σ2 = (k . . . 1)t, then let γi for i = 1, 2
be obtained from σi by replacing every letter with j adjacent copies of itself.
Then exo({γ1, γ2}, n) = n2

(t−2)! α(n)t−2±O(α(n)t−3) for k ≥ 2 and t ≥ 3.

1

Lemma 2.3 can also be used to generalize a result from [8].

Corollary 2.2. If v is a sequence that contains ababa such that f w(v) = 4,
then exu(v′, n) = Θ(nα(n)) for every sequence v′ obtained from v by replacing
any letters in v with multiple occurrences of the same letter.

Every sequence v containing ababa with f w(v) = 4 is listed in [8]. More-
over, note that every sequence v′ containing ababa with df w(v′) = 4 can be
obtained from a sequence v containing ababa with f w(v) = 4 by replacing
any letters in v with multiple occurrences of the same letter.

0-1 Matrix Results

Next we prove the corresponding 0 − 1 matrix bounds, using the bounds on
λr,s(n) combined with a function for 0 − 1 matrices analogous to f w.

Deﬁnition 11. If M is a 0 − 1 matrix or a family of 0 − 1 matrices having
no columns with multiple ones, then mf w(M) is the minimum s for which
there exists r such that every permutation matrix (r, s)-formation contains
M.

6

As with the function f w for sequences, it is convenient to deﬁne binary

permutation matrix (r, s)-formations in order to compute mf w.

Deﬁnition 12. A binary permutation matrix (r, s)-formation is a permuta-
tion matrix (r, s)-formation in which every permutation is either the identity
matrix or its reﬂection.

Lemma 3.1. Every permutation matrix ((r−1)2s−1 +1, s)-formation contains
a binary permutation matrix (r, s)-formation.

Proof. As in [7], the result can be proved by inducting on s and successively
applying the Erdos-Szekeres theorem.

Corollary 3.1. If Ak,t is a horizontal concatenation of t k × k identity ma-
trices and Bk,t is its horizontal reﬂection, then mf w({Ak,t, Bk,t}) = 2t − 1.

Proof. The upper bound follows from the last lemma and the pigeonhole
principle. The lower bound follows since a binary permutation matrix (z, 2t−
2)-formation with exactly t−1 identity matrices avoids both Ak,t and Bk,t.

Theorem 3.1. If Ak,t is a horizontal concatenation of t k × k identity
matrices and Bk,t is its horizontal reﬂection, then ex({Ak,t, Bk,t}, n) ≤ n ·
2(1/(t−2)!)α(n)(t−2) +O(α(n)t−3) for t ≥ 3.

Proof. The upper bound follows from the last corollary and the upper bounds
on λr,s(n) in the introduction.

Theorem 3.2. If Ak is a horizontal concatenation of 2 k×k identity matrices
and Bk is its horizontal reﬂection, then ex({Ak, Bk}, n) = Θ(n).

Proof. The upper bound follows from the last theorem, while the lower bound
follows from the fact that both Ak and Bk have at least two ones.

As with ordered sequences, we can also generalize the last two results by

using doubled formation width for 0 − 1 matrices.

Deﬁnition 13. If M is a 0 − 1 matrix or a family of 0 − 1 matrices having no
columns with multiple ones, then dmf w(M) is the minimum s for which there
exists r such that every r-fat permutation matrix (r, s)-formation contains
M.

We deﬁned reduced sequences to not have any adjacent same letters.

Below is a similar deﬁnition for 0 − 1 matrices.

7

Deﬁnition 14. If M is a 0-1 matrix or family of 0-1 matrices having no
columns with multiple ones, then red(M) is the result of replacing every
block of adjacent columns in u having ones in the same row with a single
column having a one in the row.

Like Lemma 2.3, the next lemma is a trivial consequence of Lemma 1.2

in [12].

Lemma 3.2. dmf w(u) = mf w(red(M)) for all 0 − 1 matrices M having no
columns with multiple ones

As with ordered sequences, we can use the last lemma to generalize the

bounds in Theorem 3.1.

Lemma 3.3. If Aj,k,t is a horizontal concatenation of t k × k j-fat identity
matrices and Bj,k,t is its horizontal reﬂection, then dmf w({Ak,t, Bk,t}) =
2t − 1.

Corollary 3.2. If Aj,k,t is a horizontal concatenation of t k × k j-fat identity
matrices and Bj,k,t is its horizontal reﬂection, then ex({Aj,k,t, Bj,k,t}, n) ≤
n · 2(1/(t−2)!)α(n)(t−2) +O(α(n)t−3) for t ≥ 3.

Corollary 3.3. If Aj,k is a horizontal concatenation of 2 k × k j-fat identity
matrices and Bj,k is its horizontal reﬂection, then ex({Aj,k, Bj,k}, n) = Θ(n).

4 Open Problems

There are many unordered sequence patterns, ordered sequence patterns, 0-1
matrix patterns, and families of patterns for which the extremal functions
do not yet have tight bounds. It is likely that the upper bounds for many of
these extremal functions can be improved using formation width.

Clearly formation width is not useful to bound the extremal function of a
single ordered sequence, since f w(u) is the length of u when u is an ordered
sequence. The same is true for using mf w to bound the extremal function
of a single forbidden 0 − 1 matrix.

However, f w was used to derive tight bounds on numerous extremal func-
tions of unordered sequences in [7, 8] and on forbidden pairs of ordered se-
quences in this paper. Moreover, mf w was used to derive tight bounds on
the extremal functions of forbidden pairs of 0 − 1 matrices in this paper. It

8

is an open problem to ﬁnd more families of patterns for which f w and mf w
provide tight upper bounds on the extremal functions.

Currently the running times of the algorithms for f w and mf w grow
exponentially in the output, which is bounded by the length of the input.
The known algorithm for f w is described in both [7] and [8], while the known
algorithm for mf w is analogous. Speeding up the computation of f w and
mf w would enable these functions to be used for bounding the extremal
functions of larger patterns than the ones that have been considered so far.
