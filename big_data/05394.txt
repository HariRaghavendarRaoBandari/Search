A fully relativistic ab-initio study on free Rh clusters of 13–135 atoms is performed to identify
general trends concerning their magnetism and to check whether concepts which proved to be useful
in interpreting magnetism of 3d metals are applicable to magnetism of 4d systems. We found that
there is no systematic relation between local magnetic moments and coordination numbers. On the
other hand, the Stoner model appears well-suited both as a criterion for the onset of magnetism and
as a guide for the dependence of local magnetic moments on the site-resolved density of states at
the Fermi level. Large orbital magnetic moments antiparallel to spin magnetic moments were found
for some sites. The intra-atomic magnetic dipole Tz term can be quite large at certain sites but as
a whole it is unlikely to aﬀect the interpretation of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism experiments
based on the sum rules.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetism of systems with reduced dimensions is a
vivid research area both because of fundamental inter-
est and because of technological relevance. To be able
to design new devices based on magnetism of clusters
and thin ﬁlms one should have an intuitive understand-
ing for these, so that one can estimate beforehand which
conﬁgurations and compositions might be perspective or
not. Magnetism of Rh carries a special appeal because
it concerns a material which is magnetic only in reduced
dimensions and in which the spin orbit coupling (SOC)
is expected to play a more important role than in the
magnetism of 3d elements. Indeed, Rh magnetism seems
to be quite intriguing, with results obtained so far being
often controversial and not easy to interpret. Catalytic
properties of Rh add yet another impetus for studying
low-dimensional Rh systems.

The interest in free Rh clusters was stimulated by
a Stern-Gerlach-type experiment on clusters of 9–100
atoms,1 where it was found that Rh clusters have mag-
netic moments which decrease with cluster size down
from 0.8 µB in a non-monotonous way and become
strongly suppressed (possibly to zero) for clusters of
more than 60 atoms. Another experimental input comes
from x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) mea-
surements of Sessi et al.2 who studied quasi-free Rh clus-
ters of few tens of atoms in a Xe matrix on Ag(100) and
found that the clusters are magnetic, with an eﬀective
spin magnetic moment µspin of about 0.26 µB and with
the ratio between orbital and spin magnetic moments
µorb/µspin about 40%. Recently, spin and orbital mo-
ments induced in paramagnetic Rh clusters of about 220
atoms embedded in a Al2O3 matrix were determined also
via XMCD3 and it was found that the orbital moment
µorb does not exceed 2% of µspin.

For a deeper understanding of the magnetism of free
Rh clusters and of Rh magnetism in general it would be

useful to identify general trends which Rh-based systems
obey. This could be achieved by monitoring the trends
for a large set of related systems and comparing them
with the situation for (much better studied) 3d elements.
Such a study should be performed in a relativistic way be-
cause only then possible eﬀects of SOC can be properly
included. Also, experiments pose some questions that
call for fully relativistic calculations — such as the above
mentioned issue of small µorb measured by XMCD for a
set of paramagnetic clusters embedded in AlsO3 (Ref. 3)
in contrast to large µorb measured for ferromagnetic clus-
ters in a Xe matrix.2

A considerable eﬀort was devoted to theoretical re-
search on free Rh clusters recently. Even though in-
teresting and important results were obtained, only few
systematic studies for large sets of systems were done
so only an incomplete picture could have been gathered.
This is even more true concerning relativistic properties
such as orbital magnetism. Most ab initio studies fo-
cused on clusters of less than 20 atoms and speciﬁcally
on their geometries.
It turns out that small clusters
often tend to have non-compact shapes.4–6 The situa-
tion is still not clear because diﬀerent density functional
theory (DFT) implementations predict diﬀerent struc-
tures and spin conﬁgurations.7 Pseudopotential calcula-
tions seem to give rise to more open structures than all-
electron calculations.8 Structural studies for large clus-
ters were performed only within a model d-band tight-
binding (TB) Hamiltonian and it was found that the re-
laxation of bond distances for fcc clusters of 13-165 atoms
is non-uniform, with some distances decreasing and some
distances increasing.9

It emerges that the existence of more competing conﬁg-
urations is typical for Rh clusters and sometimes the con-
ﬁgurations diﬀer only little in energies but considerably
in magnetic moments.10–13 It seems that a similar situ-
ation arises regarding the suppression of magnetism for
large clusters, which occurs for sizes between 60 and 100

atoms according to the experiment.1 E.g., model Hamil-
tonian calculations found that for fcc clusters of 55 and
79 atoms magnetic solutions exist but are higher in en-
ergy than non-magnetic solutions.9 For clusters of 135
and 165 atoms, no magnetic solutions were found.9 Pseu-
dopotential calculations for icosahedral clusters yield a
ﬁnite moment for a 55-atoms cluster and a zero moment
for a 147-atoms cluster.12 At the same time, in order to
explain their XMCD experiments, Barthem et al.3 sug-
gest that the Stoner criterion may be locally fulﬁlled at
only some atoms in large Rh clusters, giving rise to an
inhomogeneous magnetic state.

Connected with the question of size-dependence of
magnetic moments is the question of the dependence of
local magnetic moments on the coordination numbers.
For 3d clusters (both free14 and supported)15–17 a dis-
tinct relation could be identiﬁed in this respect. However,
this need not be transferable to 4d clusters and there are
some hints that a relation of this kind may be absent
in Rh systems.4,6,18 However, no systematic study about
this has been performed so far.

The issue of orbital moments has not yet attracted
much theoretical attention. Model d-band TB Hamilto-
nian calculations were performed for few Rh clusters of
up to 27 atoms.19,20 It was found that µorb is typically
10–20% of µspin. The orbital moment µorb is nearly al-
ways parallel to µspin and when it is antiparallel to µspin,
it is very small. Ab initio calculations performed for Rh
clusters of 2–7 atoms lead to similar conclusions: spin
and orbital magnetic moments are always parallel to each
other and the µorb/µspin ratio is about 10%, except for
the smallest clusters.21 In all these studies the SOC was
added in a second variation approach. However, the SOC
may play a more important role in 4d clusters and it is
not clear whether it can be fully accounted for in this
way. Recalling also that recent XMCD studies led to
opposite conclusions regarding the µorb/µspin ratio,2,3 a
more detailed study of orbital magnetism of Rh clusters
is desirable.

Concerning the interpretation of experiments, let us
mention ﬁnally that the XMCD sum rules do not provide
a “bare” spin moment µspin but only its combination with
the magnetic dipole Tz term, µspin + 7Tz. It is conceiv-
able that a disagreement between theory and experiment
may arise partly due to the eﬀect of the Tz term.3 Earlier
calculations for Rh19 and Rh43 clusters suggest that this
inﬂuence should not be crucial for free clusters2 but this
ought to be analyzed more deeply and for a large set of
systems.

It turns out that despite the intense attention that has
been devoted to theoretical research on free Rh clusters,
some important issues remain to be solved. One of them
is whether there is any systematic relation between lo-
cal magnetic moments and coordination numbers as in
3d clusters or whether such a relation is totally absent.
Linked to this is a question whether the Stoner criterion
can be applied locally, i.e., whether it could be used to
estimate local magnetic moments in large clusters. The

2

relatively large SOC implies a question to what extent
will scalar-relativistic results diﬀer from fully-relativistic
results. How important is orbital magnetism in Rh clus-
ters, especially in large ones? Is it possible to reconcile
large µorb/µspin ratios obtained via XMCD by Sessi et
al.2 with small µorb/µspin ratios obtained by Barthem et
al.?3 What is the role of the magnetic dipole term Tz?
Could it possibly be responsible for the deviations be-
tween some theories and XMCD experiments?

To address

these issues, we performed a fully-
relativistic theoretical study of clusters of 13–135 atoms
and also of free-standing monolayers (for comparison).
We found that some important intuitive concepts which
proved to be useful in magnetism of 3d metals, such as
the relationship between magnetic moments and coordi-
nation numbers, are not applicable to Rh clusters (and
surfaces alike). Some other concepts, such as the Stoner
model linking magnetic moments to DOS at the Fermi
level, remain to be valid and useful.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

The calculations were performed in an ab-initio
way within the spin density functional theory, relying
on the local spin density approximation (LSDA)
as
parametrized by Vosko et al.22 The electronic structure
is described fully relativistically by the corresponding
Dirac equation. The computational approach is based
on the multiple-scattering or Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker
formalism23 as implemented in the sprkkr code.24 The
electronic structure problem is solved completely in real
space. The potentials were treated within the atomic
sphere approximation (ASA). For the angular momen-
tum expansion of the Green function, a cutoﬀ of ℓmax=3
was used. Only collinear magnetic structures were con-
sidered in this study.

The clusters were assumed to be spherical-like, con-
taining 13–135 atoms, with fcc geometry as if cut from
the bulk Rh crystal. They are centered either around an
atom (13, 19, 43, 55, 79, 87, and 135 atoms) or around an
interstitial empty site (14, 38, and 68 atoms). No struc-
tural relaxation was performed. The vacuum region was
represented by empty sites located at lattice points. The
network of these empty sites was built so that an empty
site was included if it was a ﬁrst- or second-nearest neigh-
bor to any cluster atom.

We also performed some comparative calculations for
isolated or free-standing (001), (110), and (111) monolay-
ers and for the (001) crystal surface. These calculations
were performed using supercell (multilayer) geometries.
To simulate the crystal surface, we employed a slab con-
sisting of 17 layers of Rh atoms. Successive Rh monolay-
ers or slabs were separated by 13–20 ˚A of vacuum in the
supercell. The integration over the k-points was done on
a regular mesh and for each of the systems the integra-
tion grid was chosen so that its density corresponds to
(at least) 15625 k-points in the full Brillouin zone of the

bulk Rh crystal. Otherwise the calculations were done as
for the free clusters.

III. RESULTS

A. Magnetic moments

Local moments µspin, µorb and the ratio µorb/µspin for
clusters of 13–68 atoms are shown in Tab. I. Note that
because of the presence of magnetization and of the SOC,
atoms belonging to the same coordination shell need not
be symmetry equivalent. Each value in Tab. I thus rep-
resents an average over all atoms located at the same
distance R from the center of the cluster. The magneti-
zation M is parallel to the (001) direction of the parental
fcc lattice.

No stable magnetic state was found for the 79-
atoms and 87-atoms clusters. For the 135-atoms clus-
ter a metastable magnetic state was identiﬁed (see also
Sec. III C below), with sizable magnetic moments only
at the last two coordination spheres: the average µspin
(µorb) at the distance of 6.59 ˚A is 0.091 µB (0.017 µB)
and average µspin (µorb) at the distance of 7.12 ˚A is
0.271 µB (0.025 µB).

Concerning the angular-momentum decomposition,
the d component of µspin comprises 90–95% of its to-
tal value. For µorb the dominance of the d component is
even more pronounced.

A better idea how the magnetic proﬁles look like may
be obtained from representative graphs in Fig. 1. It ap-
pears from all the data that there is hardly any common
trend in these proﬁles. This is in contrast to the case of 3d
clusters where µspin and µorb generally increase towards
the surface for all cluster sizes.14

B. Relation between local µspin and the

coordination number

Our study covers a wide range of cluster sizes so it
is possible to perform a systematic search for a relation
between local moments and coordination numbers. Ear-
lier studies failed to ﬁnd a common trend like the one
which had been identiﬁed before for the 3d clusters but
in those studies always only a small range of cluster sizes
was explored.4,6,18 We display in Fig. 2 local µspin as a
function of the coordination number for magnetic clus-
ters containing up to 135 atoms (including thus also the
metastable 135-atoms cluster).
It is evident from our
data that no common rule concerning all atoms can be
drawn for free Rh clusters.

A simple estimate of the strength of the magnetiza-
tion can be obtained from average magnetic moments and
from magnetization energies (diﬀerences of total energies
per atom for a magnetic and a non-magnetic state). Fur-
thermore, these quantities can be evaluated using fully-
relativistic calculations and using the scalar-relativistic
approximation,25 providing thus an idea on the role of
the SOC. We summarized these results in Tab. II. Note
that µorb is zero in the scalar-relativistic approximation.
Average magnetic moments as well as magnetiza-
tion energies generally decrease with cluster size, albeit
non-monotonously. For the 68-atoms cluster the mag-
netic and non-magnetic states are practically degener-
ate, whereas for the 135-atoms cluster the ground state is
non-magnetic. For a better understanding of the ∆Emag
values, recall that corresponding values for bulk 3d met-
als are 31.2 mRy, 29.8 mRy, and 3.6 mRy for Fe, Co, and
Ni, respectively. Our results indicate that for large Rh
clusters metastable isomers with diﬀerent magnetic con-
ﬁgurations should be expected, similarly as it was found
for small Rh clusters.10–13

One can see from Tab. II that the scalar-relativistic ap-
proximation overestimates µspin typically by about 10%
(except for large clusters and/or small µspin where the
relative diﬀerence is larger).
In line with this, scalar-
relativistic calculations yield larger magnetization ener-
gies.

D. Stoner criterion applied locally

When debating about magnetism of elements such as
Ru, Rh, Pd, it is often argued that these metals could
become magnetic in lower dimensions because then their
density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy n(EF ) might
increase due to band-narrowing, meaning that the Stoner
criterion

Is n(EF ) > 1

,

(1)

with Is being the Stoner integral, would be satisﬁed. It
would be interesting to see to what extent does this cri-
terion really govern magnetism of Rh.
It would be in-
structive to look not only on the clusters but on surfaces
and free-standing monolayers as well.

The Stoner exchange integral Is is considered to be
a quasi-atomic property, depending only very little on
environmental eﬀects such as bonding etc. We used the
sprkkr code to evaluate Is for bulk Rh, for the (001)
crystal surface and for free-standing (001), (110), and
(111) monolayers.26 The results are shown in Tab. III.
One can see that indeed the exchange integral Is varies
only little from one Rh system to another.

Eq. (1) contains the DOS per spin channel n(EF ) for
the non-magnetic state. Strictly speaking, n(E) is a

relatively small clusters of 10–20 atoms one approaches

a quasicontinuum regime, with an energy level distribu-
tion that resembles that of a bulk crystal.27,28 One can
construct an approximate DOS by broadening the energy
levels by a Gaussian27,28 or Lorentzian.29 In our Green

small imaginary part ImE, which is equivalent to broad-
ening the levels by a Lorentzian with full width at half
maximum of 2ImE. In this way we can evaluate n(EF )
for every atom in all the clusters we investigate. If we
choose
ImE=3 mRy, we obtain a graph for the de-
pendence of the local µspin on the corresponding n(EF )
shown in Fig. 3. The thick vertical gray line in Fig. 3
highlights the “critical DOS” which separates magnetic
systems from non-magnetic systems according to Eq. (1).
One can see that the Stoner criterion (1) can be used
with a good accuracy to predict whether a particular Rh
atom will be magnetic or not. To be more precise, it
follows from Fig. 3 that the criterion (1) is a bit too strict
— one can get magnetism also for atoms where n(EF )
is by 10–20% lower than the critical value. If the Stoner
model for the dependence of µspin on n(EF ) is adopted,30

(see the Fig. 3), the best ﬁt is obtained for Is=46.1 mRy,
in very good agreement with the directly computed val-
ues shown in Tab. III. So it turns out that the Stoner
model can serve as a guide to Rh magnetism, even con-
cerning its local aspects. We veriﬁed that this does not
depend on the particular value of the DOS broadening
we used. In fact graphs similar to Fig. 3 can be obtained
if ImE is varied within a reasonable interval 1–10 mRy.
Corresponding data for bulk and two-dimensional Rh
systems are shown in Tab. III. The only two-dimensional
system which is magnetic is the (111) free-standing
monolayer and it is also the only one which satisﬁes the
criterion given by Eq. (1). We included these data in
Fig. 3 to demonstrate that they follow the same trend as
the data for clusters.

Corresponding data for free-standing monolayers are included
as well. The vertical band highlights the critical value of
n(EF ) when the Stoner product Isn(EF ) becomes larger than
one. The dashed line is a ﬁt to the Stoner model in Eq. (2).

E. Anisotropy of µorb and Tz

The relatively strong SOC for Rh implies that µorb
could play a more important role than in the case of
3d clusters. Its eﬀects are also accessible to experiment
via XMCD; partially conﬂicting result were obtained in

this respect.2,3 Linked to the use of the XMCD is also
the magnetic dipole term because the XMCD sum rules
deal not with µspin alone but only with a combination
µspin + 7Tz, where Tz is the expectation value of the
intra-atomic dipole operator for the valence d electrons
(assuming that the z axis is chosen parallel to M ). Both
µorb and Tz depend on the magnetization direction.31–33
This dependence was studied for 3d free clusters14 and
adatoms34 in the past. The Tz term can signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the perceived dependence of µspin on the cluster
size35 and it was suggested that this might occur also for
4d clusters.21

We calculated µorb and Tz for several magnetization
directions, for all the cluster sizes we explore here. As
a representative example we select the 55-atoms cluster
with M parallel to the [001], [111], and [221] crystallo-
graphic directions. The results are shown in Fig. 4. One
notices immediately the eﬀect of the decrease of the sym-
metry due to the magnetization and the SOC: there is a
signiﬁcant spread in the Tz and µorb values for atoms
which are at the same distance from the center. There is
also a signiﬁcant dependence on the direction of M for
Tz and µorb of the individual atoms.

When looking at the Tz term, we can see that as con-
cerns individual atoms, Tz could indeed be the cause of a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between µspin and µspin + 7Tz; the
magnitude of 7Tz is sometimes comparable to the corre-
sponding µspin for the Rh55 cluster (see also Tab. I). How-
ever, the averaged or “cumulative” values of Tz are very
small, as evidenced by the lines in the left panel of Fig. 4.
This is apparently linked to the fact that our clusters
are spherical-like and therefore averaging over atoms for
a ﬁxed magnetization direction is approximately equiva-
lent to averaging over magnetization directions for a ﬁxed
atom. Such an averaging should yield a small value for Tz
due to the approximate relation Tx + Ty + Tz = 0 (valid
exactly in the absence of the SOC).31 Therefore, as the
measured XMCD always reﬂects all atoms in the cluster,

it seems that the Tz term cannot aﬀect the interpretation
of XMCD experiments for free Rh clusters. At least —
not as long as they remain approximately spherical.

Concerning the orbital moments (right panel of Fig. 4),
again we can see a signiﬁcant anisotropy when focus-
ing on individual atoms but hardly any anisotropy when
focusing on the average values (similarly as for free Fe
clusters).14 This apparently reﬂects the fact that the ge-
ometry of the clusters is cubic.

IV. DISCUSSION

Our goal was to search for common trends governing
magnetism of Rh clusters, especially those with more
than about 20 atoms. We found that there is no sys-
tematic link between magnetic moments and coordina-
tion numbers. On the other hand, systematic trends
can be identiﬁed in the dependence of µspin on n(EF ).
Metastable magnetic states exist for large clusters. The
inﬂuence of the SOC on magnetism of Rh is not negligible
but not crucial either.

The lack of a systematic relation between local mag-
netic moments and coordination numbers is perhaps the
most striking feature of magnetism of Rh in compari-
son with magnetism of 3d metals.
It means that intu-
itive arguments which are routinely used when analyzing
magnetism of 3d metals cannot be applied. This can be
illustrated by the case of free-standing Rh monolayers of
diﬀerent crystallographic types (see Tab. III) where the
only one which is magnetic is the one with the largest
coordination number.
It is interesting to note that an-
other kind of unusual trend in Rh magnetism was ob-
served before, namely, the increase of magnetic moments
of Rh adatoms on Ag(001) with decreasing interatomic
distance.36 Unusual magnetic behaviour of Rh can thus
be expected in a variety of environments.

We conjecture that the “anomalous” behavior of Rh
observed here is linked to the fact that 4d electrons are
less localized than 3d electrons and thus the dominance of
the nearest-neighbors inﬂuence over the inﬂuence of more
distant neighbors is much smaller for the 4d metals than
for the 3d metals. To be quantitative, for metallic Co,
which is a 3d analogue of Rh, the center of mass of the
valence d wave function deﬁned as r3d = |hψ3d| r |ψ3di|
is at about 0.52 ˚A, which presents 21% of the bulk in-
teratomic distance.
(A ψ3d(r) wave function obtained
for a representative energy corresponding to the high-
est majority-spin states DOS was used.) This should
be compared to the d wave function for metallic Rh for
which one gets r4d ≈ 0.78 ˚A, which presents 31% of the
bulk interatomic distance. Our results also complement
arguments of Mavropoulos et al.15 concerning magnetic
moments of supported 3d and 4d clusters.

The Stoner model appears well-suited for describing
magnetism of 4d metals. It proves to be useful as a crite-
rion for the onset of magnetism, as it was demonstrated
recently for Rh monolayers on noble metals surfaces.37
However, it serves also as a guide for the dependence of
the magnitude of local magnetic moments on the DOS
at the Fermi level. Here we would like to mention that a
relationship between local µspin and n(EF ) was observed
also for thin Pd slabs,38 again underlining the relevance
of the Stoner model for magnetism of 4d systems. This
supports the argumentation of Barthem et al.3 that in
large Rh clusters some atoms may be magnetic and oth-
ers non-magnetic because n(EF ) may diﬀer a lot from
one atom to another.

Even though the SOC does not play a prominent role in
Rh magnetism, there may be situations where it is quite
important. This is illustrated by the case of the central
atom of the Rh19 cluster where µorb reaches 35% of µspin
and is oriented antiparallel to µspin (see Tab. I). Antipar-
allel orientation of µorb can be observed also for the Rh38
cluster. This ﬁnding is interesting because an antiparal-
lel orientation of µorb for some atoms might explain why
only very small averaged orbital moments were found for
embedded Rh clusters via the XMCD measurements of
Barthem et al.3

A large antiparallel µorb for some Rh clusters was ob-
tained by our fully-relativistic ab-initio calculations but
not by earlier model d-band TB Hamiltonian calcula-
tions where the SOC was added within the second varia-
tion approach.19 A detailed comparison between our re-
sults and the model Hamiltonian results is presented in
Tab. IV for Rh13 and Rh19 clusters (moments for the
same geometries are shown). One can see that there is a
general agreement between both calculations but diﬀer-
ences occur for some atoms.

All our calculations were done for bulk-like, i.e., unre-
laxed geometries. Changing the interatomic distances
would of course aﬀect the calculated µspin and µorb.
Ab-initio calculations for clusters of 2–19 atoms found
that bond-length contraction of 4–8 % may lead to large
changes of magnetic moments,
in particular for a 4-

relativistic ab-initio calculations compared to results obtained

term.19 Results for the Rh13 and Rh19 clusters are resolved
according to distances of atoms from the center of the cluster,
as indicated by the indices in the parantheses in the ﬁrst col-
umn. Two diﬀerent values of µorb are often present because
magnetization together with the SOC decreases the symmetry
in a fully relativistic treament.

atoms cluster and a 10-atoms cluster.10 However, the
bond length changes are less important for large clus-
ters — in fact, model Hamiltonian calculations suggest
a bond-length contraction of about 4 % for clusters of
8–13 atoms but only 1–3 % for clusters of 55 and 147
atoms.39 Another study based on semi-empirical poten-
tial and model spd TB Hamiltonians found that the av-
erage nearest-neighbor distance is close to the bulk-like
distance for clusters of more than about 20 atoms.18 Let
us also mention a model Hamiltonian study which found
that using equilibrium bond lengths instead of bulk bond
lengths changes µspin and µorb by about 50 % for a clus-
ter of 13 atoms while for clusters of 19 and 27 atoms
the bond relaxation decreases µspin only by about 10%
and µorb by about 20%.19 The fcc growth mode adopted
here is plausible in the light of the ab initio study of
Futschek et al.13 who found that clusters of more than
about ten atoms adopt ground state geometries that can
be considered as fragments of the fcc crystal structure.
We conclude that while small clusters of less than ∼10
atoms are quite sensitive to structural relaxation, results
for large Rh clusters are not so dependent on whether
the structural relaxation has been performed or not.

When compared with experiment on free Rh clusters,1
our calculation gives higher average magnetic moments in
the 13–55 atoms size range. A d band TB model Hamilto-
nian study of fcc clusters9 gave similar values as our study
while an ab initio pseudopotential-based calculations of
icosahedral clusters12 led to smaller values, in a better
agreement with the experiment. However, one should be
cautious about drawing conclusions, say, about prefer-
ence of the icosahedral geometry over the fcc geometry
just from this: in all the theoretical studies, only few clus-
ter sizes were considered beyond the 20-atoms limit and
the dependence of the average magnetic moment on the

cluster size displays a quasi-oscillatory behavior, so one
cannot be sure how representative the results are. One
should also take into account that in the case of small
clusters, where more theoretical studies we performed,
the results often diﬀer substantially from one study to
another.4–8,12,13 It turns out that accurate calculations
which could be directly compared to experiment are very
diﬃcult to perform because the systems are quite com-
plex and there are many factors to control. Therefore, it
is useful to perform a study like the current one which
focuses on the analysis of general trends and rules which
the Rh cluster should obey, to improve our intuitive un-
derstanding.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Some important intuitive concepts which proved to be
useful in interpreting the magnetism of 3d metals are not
applicable to magnetism of 4d systems such as Rh clus-
ters. In particular there is no systematic relation between
local magnetic moments and coordination numbers. On
the other hand, the Stoner model describes even local

8

aspect of Rh magnetism quite well; atoms for which the
DOS in the non-magnetic state n(EF ) is more than 20
states per spin per Ry will be magnetic.

Fully-relativistic calculations indicate that there can
be large µorb antiparallel to µspin for some atoms. The
intra-atomic Tz term can be quite large at certain sites
but as a whole it is unlikely to aﬀect the interpretation of
XMCD experiments based on the sum rules. For clusters
in the ∼100 atoms size range it is likely that there will
be metastable magnetic conﬁgurations, with excitation
energies less than 0.1 mRy per atom.
