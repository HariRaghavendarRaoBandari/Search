The LMMP for log canonical 3-folds in char p

Joe Waldron

Abstract. We prove that one can run the log minimal model program for
log canonical 3-fold pairs in characteristic p > 5. In particular we prove the
Cone Theorem, Contraction Theorem, the existence of ﬂips and the existence
of log minimal models for pairs with log divisor numerically equivalent to an
eﬀective divisor. These follow from our main results, which are that certain
log minimal models are good.

1. Introduction

All varieties will be over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic p > 5.
The log minimal model program (LMMP) for klt threefold pairs in charac-
teristic p > 5 has recently been completed ([12], [10], [3], [6]). Here we prove
some results on the LMMP for log canonical threefold pairs in characteristic
p > 5. Our proofs rely on the LMMP for klt pairs in a crucial way.

Our main results are the following:

Theorem 1.1 (Good log minimal models 1). Let (X, B) be a projective log
canonical 3-fold pair over k with Q-boundary B together with projective con-
traction X → Z, such that KX + B is nef/Z and big/Z. Then KX + B is
semi-ample/Z.

Theorem 1.2 (Good log minimal models 2). Let (X, B) be a projective log
canonical 3-fold pair over k with Q-boundary B together with projective con-
traction X → Z. Suppose in addition that A is an ample/Z Q-divisor such that
KX + B + A is nef/Z. Then KX + B + A is semi-ample/Z

Similar results in characteristic zero were proven in [4], and also in great
generality in [11] using vanishing theorems. In place of vanishing theorems we
use Keel’s semi-ampleness criterion [12] (which is unavailable in characteristic
zero) to reduce the problem to lower dimensions. We prove semi-ampleness
on the boundary by using adjunction to a partial normalisation of ⌊BY ⌋ and
applying abundance for semi log canonical surfaces [20].

Thus one of the main technical results used in the proof is the following:

Theorem 1.3. Let (Y, BY ) be a projective Q-factorial dlt 3-fold pair with Q-
boundary over k such that KY +BY is nef. Then (KY +BY )|⌊BY ⌋ is semi-ample.

Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 can be used to contract an extremal ray via a projective

morphism.

Corollary 1.4 (Contraction Theorem). Let (X, B) be a projective log canonical
3-fold pair over k. Suppose R is a KX + B-negative extremal ray. Then there
exists a projective contraction X → Z contracting R.

In particular this gives projective ﬂipping contractions, and we can also apply

Theorem 1.1 to construct ﬂips.

Corollary 1.5 (Existence of ﬂips). Let (X, B) be a projective log canonical 3-
fold pair with R-boundary over k, together with an extremal ﬂipping contraction
f : X → Z. Then the ﬂip of f exists.

We also use ACC for log canonical thresholds to show that any LMMP which

begins from an eﬀective pair terminates, as in characteristic zero [2].

Theorem 1.6 (Termination for eﬀective pairs). Let (X, B) be a log canonical
3-fold pair with R-boundary over k. Then any sequence of KX + B-ﬂips which
are also M -ﬂips for some M ≥ 0 terminates.

In Section 3 we extend the cone theorem to general log canonical 3-folds in
char p > 5. Note that this gives new information even in the klt case if the
variety is not Q-factorial.

Theorem 1.7 (Cone Theorem). Let (X, B) be a projective log canonical 3-fold
pair with R-boundary over k. There exists a countable collection of rational
curves {Ci} on X such that

(1) NE 1(X) = NE 1(X) ∩ (KX + B)≥0 + Pi R · [Ci]
(2) −6 ≤ (KX + B) · Ci < 0

The LMMP for log canonical 3-folds in char p

(3) For any ample A, (KX + B + A) · Ci ≥ 0 for all but ﬁnitely many i
(4) The rays {R · [Ci]} do not accumulate in (KX + B)<0.

Putting all this together allows us to deduce the following:

Corollary 1.8 (Log minimal models). Let (X, B) be a projective log canonical
3-fold pair with R-boundary over k, together with projective contraction X → Z,
such that there is M ≥ 0 with KX + B ≡ M/Z. Then there exists a log minimal
model (Y /Z, BY ) for (X/Z, B), such that Y 99K X does not contract divisors.
In fact this log minimal model can be produced by running a terminating

LMMP/Z starting from (X/Z, B).

If in addition KX + B is big/Z or B is a Q-boundary equal to the sum of a
eﬀective divisor and a big/Z and semi-ample/Z divisor, then this log minimal
model is good.

A stronger version of Theorem 1.1 over Fp was proven by Martinelli, Naka-
mura and Witaszek in [18], using diﬀerent methods. A version of our Theorem
1.2 over Fp has been obtained independently in [19] by the latter two authors
using methods similar to our own proof of Theorem 1.2 in Section 6. A similar
method was also used for 4-folds in characteristic zero in [14].

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Semi-ampleness results in positive characteristic. This section sum-
marises some special features of positive characteristic which we use in what
follows. The ﬁrst is a criterion for semi-ampleness due to Keel.

Deﬁnition 2.1 ([12, 0.1]) Let X be a scheme proper over a ﬁeld k, with nef
line bundle L. The exceptional locus E(L) of L is deﬁned to be the Zariski
closure of the union of all subvarieties V of X such that L|V is not big, given
reduced structure.

Proposition 2.2 ([12, 1.9]). Let X be a scheme projective over a ﬁeld of positive
characteristic, with a nef line bundle L. Then L is semi-ample iﬀ L|E(L) is semi-
ample.

A universal homeomorphism is a morphism of varieties which is a homeomor-
phism after arbitrary base change. However for ﬁnite morphisms, it is suﬃcient
to check less:

Proposition 2.3 ([8, I.3.7-8][16, Lem 49]). For a ﬁnite morphism f : Y → X,
TFAE:

(1) f is a universal homeomorphism
(2) f is surjective and injective on geometric points
(3) f induces a purely inseparable extension of residue ﬁelds for every x ∈ X

4

Joe Waldron

Any ﬁnite universal homeomorphism factors into some power of the Frobenius
morphism, which allows us to move information on line bundles in the reverse
direction:

Proposition 2.4 ([12, 1.4]). Let f : X → Y be a ﬁnite universal homeomor-
phism between schemes of ﬁnite type over a ﬁeld of positive characteristic. Let
L be a line bundle on Y . Then L is semi-ample if and only if f ∗L is semi-ample.

2.2. Partially normal schemes. We collect some (standard) deﬁnitions and
properties of several kinds of partially normal varieties.

Deﬁnition 2.5 A scheme satisﬁes Serre’s S2 condition at x ∈ X if

depthx OX,x ≥ min(2, dimx OX,x)

Proposition 2.6 ([9, 5.10-11], [1]). Given a quasi-projective reduced, equidi-
mensional variety X there exists a birational morphism φ : Y → X, called the
S2-ﬁcation, such that the following hold:

(1) For x ∈ X, X satisﬁes S2 at x if and only if φ is an isomorphism at x.
(2) The set U where X satisﬁes S2 is open and codim(X − U, X) ≥ 2
(3) Y satisﬁes S2 at all points
(4) φ is ﬁnite and the normalisation of X factors through φ

Remark 2.7 This partial normalisation has been called by various alternative
names in the literature, for example the S2-iﬁcation, S2-ization, Z [2]-closure and
saturation in codimension 2

Deﬁnition 2.8 ([15, 5.1]) A scheme is demi-normal if it is S2 and has at
worst nodes in codimension 1.

The following result was largely proven in [10] and [15], and stated in this

form in [7].

Proposition 2.9. Let (X, B) be a Q-factorial dlt 3-fold pair with B = Pi Di +
B′ where ⌊B⌋ = Pi Di. Then the following hold:

• The s-codimensional log canoical centres of (X, B) are exactly the irre-

ducible components of the various intersections Di1 ∩ ... ∩ Dis

• Each irreducible component of Di1 ∩ ... ∩ Dis is normal and of pure

codimension s.

2.3. 3-fold LMMP. Given a Q-factorial dlt 3-fold pair (X, B) over a ﬁeld of
char p > 5 and a projective contraction X → Z we may run a KX + B-MMP/Z
using the results of [3] and [6]. We also use the following results:

Proposition 2.10 ([3, Prop 5.5]). Let (X, B) be a projective Q-factorial dlt 3-
fold pair over k of char p > 5. Suppose we are given a sequence of KX +B-ﬂips.
Then after ﬁnitely many ﬂips, each remaining ﬂip is an isomorphism near ⌊B⌋.

Proposition 2.11 ([3, Thm 1.6]). Let (X, B) be a lc 3-fold pair over k of char
p > 5. Then (X, B) has a crepant Q-factorial dlt model. In particular this
morphism is small over the klt locus of (X, B).

The LMMP for log canonical 3-folds in char p

We will follow the convention that, by deﬁnition, if (Y, BY ) is a log minimal
model of (X, B) then Y 99K X does not contract divisors. Note that this is
stronger than the deﬁnition which is sometimes used, but the diﬀerence only
occurs when working on non-klt pairs.

2.4. Polytopes of boundary divisors. We will use the following result from
[6], proven in characteristic zero in [5].

Proposition 2.12. Let X be a Q-factorial projective klt variety over k, V be
a ﬁnite-dimensional rational aﬃne subspace of the space of Weil R-divisors on
X, and

L = {∆ ∈ V | (X, ∆) is lc}

Fix B ∈ L. Then there are real numbers α, δ > 0, depending only on (X, B)
and V , such that

(1) if Γ is any extremal curve and if (KX +B)·Γ > 0, then (KX +B)·Γ > α;
(2) if ∆ ∈ L, ||∆ − B|| < δ and (KX + ∆) · R ≤ 0 for an extremal ray R,

then (KX + B) · R ≤ 0;

(3) let {Rt}t∈T be a family of extremal rays of NE(X). Then the set

NT = {∆ ∈ L | (KX + ∆) · Rt ≥ 0 for any t ∈ T }

is a rational polytope;

(4) assume KX + B is nef, ∆ ∈ L, and that Xi 99K Xi+1/Zi is a sequence
of KX + ∆-ﬂips which are KX + B-trivial and X = X1; then for any
curve Γ on any Xi, we have (KXi + Bi) · Γ > α if (KXi + Bi) · Γ > 0
where Bi is the birational transform of B;

(5) in addition to the assumptions of (4) suppose that ||∆ − B|| < δ; if
(KXi+∆i)·R ≤ 0 for an extremal ray R on some Xi, then (KXi+Bi)·R =
0 where ∆i is the birational transform of ∆.

3. Cone Theorem

We will prove the Cone Theorem for log canonical pairs by passing to a
crepant Q-factorial dlt model and using the Q-factorial dlt Cone Theorem
[6,1.1].

Lemma 3.1. Let f : V → W be a surjective linear map of ﬁnite dimensional
vector spaces. Suppose CV ⊂ V and CW ⊂ W are closed convex cones of
maximal dimension and H ⊂ W is a linear subspace of codimension 1. Assume:

• f (CV ) = CW
• CW ∩ H ⊂ ∂CW

Then f −1H ∩ CV ⊂ ∂CV and also f −1H ∩ CV = f −1(H ∩ CW ) ∩ CV .

Proof. First we claim that

f −1(∂CW ) ∩ CV ⊂ ∂CV

Take v ∈ f −1(∂CW ) ∩ CV . Let w = f (v). As w ∈ ∂CW there is a convergent
sequence wi → w such that wi 6∈ CW for all i. f −1(wi) is an aﬃne space in V
which does not intersect CV (else wi ∈ CW ), and these aﬃne spaces converge

6

Joe Waldron

to the aﬃne space f −1(w). Therefore we can choose vi ∈ f −1(wi) such that
vi converge to v. Thus we have sequence vi not in CV converging to v and so
v ∈ ∂CV .

We prove the ﬁrst claim of the Lemma. Suppose v ∈ f −1H ∩ CV . Then
w = f (v) ∈ CW ∩ H ⊂ ∂CW . So v ∈ f −1(∂CW ) and also in CV so it is in ∂CV
by the initial claim.

We prove the second claim. Suppose v ∈ f −1H ∩ CV . Let w = f (v). Then
w ∈ H, but also w ∈ CW as f (CV ) = CW . The other inclusion is even more
obvious.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.7. (X, B) has a crepant Q-factorial dlt model (Y, BY ), with
birational morphism f : Y → X. There is a surjective linear map of vector
spaces

which induces a surjection on the pseudo-eﬀective cones

f∗ : N1(Y ) → N1(X)

f∗(NE1(Y )) = (NE 1(X))

By the Q-factorial dlt Cone Theorem, there is a countable collection of ra-
i on Y satisfying the requirements of the Cone Theorem. In

tional curves C Y
particular,

NE 1(Y ) = NE1(Y ) ∩ (KY + BY )≥0 + X

R · [C Y
i ]

i

Let Ci be the countable collection of rational curves on X given by letting Ci be
f∗C Y
i with reduced structure. We claim that these curves satisfy (1). Suppose
instead

NE 1(X) 6= NE 1(X) ∩ (KX + B)≥0 + X

R · [Ci]

i

Then there is some R-Cartier divisor D which is positive on NE 1(X) ∩ (KX +
B)≥0 + Pi R · [Ci] but non-positive somewhere on NE1(X). Let A be an ample
divisor and λ = inf{t : D + tA is nef}. Then D + λA is nef but not ample
so by Kleiman’s criterion it takes value zero somewhere on NE 1(X)\{0}. By
replacing D by D + λA we may assume D is non-negative on NE1(X)\{0} but
D=0 intersects NE 1(X) non-trivially. So D=0 cuts out some extremal face F of
NE1(X). By Lemma 3.1,

FY := f −1

∗ F ∩ NE 1(Y ) = f −1

∗ D=0 ∩ NE 1(Y )

is some non-empty extremal face of NE1(Y ), which is KY + BY -negative away
from the lower dimensional f −1
∗ (0). But any such extremal face contains a
KY + BY -negative extremal ray R, which contains one of the C Y
i . But then
D=0 contains one of the Ci, which contradicts our assumption of inequality.

That

−6 ≤ (KX + B) · Ci < 0

The LMMP for log canonical 3-folds in char p

follows directly from the deﬁnition of the Ci, the Q-factorial dlt Cone Theorem,
the projection formula and the observation

0 <

(KX + B) · Ci
(KX + B) · f∗C Y
i

< 1

Next we show that the rays Ri = R · [Ci] do not accumulate in (KX + B)<0.
Suppose otherwise, so there is some sequence Ri converging to a KX + B-
negative ray R. Let RY
i = Ri.
Such a ray exists by deﬁnition of the Ri. By compactness of the unit ball in
NE1(Y ), some subsequence of the RY
i must converge to a ray RY . This must
satisfy f∗RY = R, and so by the projection formula it is KY + BY -negative.
This contradicts the dlt Q-factorial cone theorem.

i be an extremal ray in NE1(Y ) satisfying f∗RY

Finally, let A be an ample divisor on X. Suppose there are inﬁnitely many
Ci with (KX + B + A) · Ci < 0. By compactness, some subsequence of the
corresponding Ri converge to a ray R. This must satisfy (KX + B + A) · R ≤ 0,
but R ⊂ NE 1(X) so this implies KX + B · R < 0, which contradicts (4).

(cid:3)

4. Termination

Remark 4.1 ([2, Construction 3.1]) Given a lc 3-fold pair (X, B) we may take
a crepant Q-factorial dlt model φ : Y → X using Prop 2.11. Let BY be the dlt
boundary such that KY + BY ∼ φ∗(KX + B). Suppose we have a KX + B ﬂip
X 99K X +/Z. Then (X +, BX +) is the unique log canonical model/Z given by
Proj ⊕φ∗OX (m(KX + B)). By [3] we may run a KY + BY -LMMP over Z. If
this LMMP terminates, say with Y 99K Y +, (X +, BX +) is also the unique log
canonical model for (Y +, BY + ) over Z, so we get a morphism Y + → X + and
(Y +, BY +) is a crepant Q-factorial dlt model of (X +, BX +).

Proof of 1.6. We follow the characteristic zero proof in [2]; including the details
to ensure there are no positive characteristic problems.

We have a lc pair (X, B), and an inﬁnite sequence of KX + B-ﬂips which are

also M-ﬂips for M ≥ 0.

Let t1 = lct(X, B, M) and (X 1, B1, M 1) = (X, B, M).

Let (Y, ∆) be a crepant Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B + t1M), with f : Y →
X. Let BY (resp. MY ) be the birational transform on Y of B (resp. M), so
that ∆Y = BY + t1MY + E where E is the reduced exceptional locus of f . In
addition let 0 ≤ B′
Y ≤ MY ) be the divisors formed as
follows:

Y ≤ BY (resp. 0 ≤ M ′

Thus we have ∆Y = B′
Y +⌊BY + t1MY ⌋+E. Run a KY +∆Y -MMP/Z1.
If this terminates it gives us (Y2, ∆Y2) which is a crepant Q-factorial dlt model
for (X2, B2 + t1M2). In particular this cannot be isomorphic to (Y, ∆Y ). Now
repeat the process from (Y2, ∆Y2). Either way we get an inﬁnite sequence of
KY + ∆Y -ﬂips.

By Prop 2.10 these ﬂips are eventually isomorphisms near ⌊∆Y ⌋, so we may
replace Y and the sequence of ﬂips with a truncated version to assume that each
ﬂipping locus is disjoint from ⌊∆Y ⌋ and also to ensure there are no divisorial
contractions. Now each of the KY + ∆Y -ﬂips is also a KY + B′
Y -ﬂip and
a M ′

Y -ﬂip. In particular, M ′

Y + t1M ′

tion. Let (X 2, B2, M 2, t2) = (Y, B′
Y , t2). We are in the same situation with
X 2 as we began in with X. Therefore we can inductively create a sequence
t1 < t2 < t3 < ... of log canonical thresholds for pairs and divisors with coef-
ﬁcients in a ﬁnite set. This contradicts ACC ([3, Thm 1.10]), so there cannot
have been such an inﬁnite sequence of ﬂips.

We now use this to extend special termination for Q-factorial dlt pairs [3,

Prop 5.5] to general log canonical pairs.

Proposition 4.2. Let (X, B) be a projective log canonical 3-fold pair over k.
Suppose we are given a sequence of KX + B-ﬂips,

Then the ﬂipping locus is eventually disjoint from LCS(X, B).

X = X1 99K X2 99K X3 99K ...

Proof. Suppose the ﬂipping contractions are fi : Xi → Zi. Let (Y1, BY1) be
a crepant Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B). Run the KY1 + BY1-MMP/Z1 as
described above. This LMMP terminates because it is a KY1 + BY1 + f ∗
1 A-MMP
for a suﬃciently large ample divisor A on Z1. Continuing to run these LMMPs
as above we get the diagram:

where (Yi, BYi) is a Q-factorial dlt model of (Xi, BXi). The top row is a
KY +BY -MMP, so by special termination for Q-factorial dlt pairs the birational
maps Yi 99K Yi+1 are isomorphisms near ⌊BYi⌋ for i >> 0. Suppose Xi 99K Xi+1
is not an isomorphism near LCS(Xi, BXi). Let φi and φi+1 be a resolution of
Yi 99K Yi+1.

is anti-nef and exceptional /Z, so is eﬀective. Let Γ be a curve on Yi surjective to
the ﬂipping locus on Xi and ΓW a curve on W surjective to Γ. Then D · ΓW < 0

and so ΓW is contained in the support of D. But D = 0 in a neighbourhood of
φ−1(⌊BYi⌋), so we have a contradiction as Γ intersects ⌊BYi⌋.

(cid:3)

5. Restriction

In characteristic zero, the reduced boundary ⌊BY ⌋ of a dlt pair is both S2
and seminormal. The proof [13, 17.5] uses vanishing theorems and may fail in
positive characteristic. Instead we use a partial normalisation of ⌊BY ⌋

Lemma 5.1. Let (Y, BY ) be a Q-factorial dlt 3-fold pair over k. Then ⌊BY ⌋ is
nodal in codimension 1.

Proof. This is essentially by deﬁnition of dlt. Let ξ be a codimension 1 point of
⌊BY ⌋, which we may assume is a singular point of ⌊BY ⌋. Each component of
⌊BY ⌋ is normal (Prop 2.9) so ξ must be the intersection of two components E1
and E2. But by deﬁnition of dlt, (Y, BY ) is simple normal crossing in an open
neighbourhood containing any generic point of E1 ∩ E2.
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.2. Let (Y, BY ) be a Q-factorial dlt 3-fold pair over k. Let S be
the S2-ﬁcation of ⌊BY ⌋. Then π : S → ⌊BY ⌋ is a ﬁnite universal homeomor-
phism from a demi-normal scheme.

Proof. π is an isomorphism in codimension 1 because ⌊BY ⌋ is reduced and
equidimensional. We show that π is injective and surjective on geometric points.
It is surjective because normalisation is surjective and π factors into the nor-
malisation.

Suppose P is a geometric point on ⌊BY ⌋ with more than one pre-image.
We will use what we know of ⌊BY ⌋ from Prop 2.9 to reach a contradiction.
Firstly observe that P cannot have more than one pre-image in any irreducible
component of S, because π factors into the normalisation of ⌊BY ⌋, which is just
the disjoint union of the components and so any point of ⌊BY ⌋ has at most one
pre-image in any component of this normalisation.

Therefore we may assume P is contained in at least two components E1 and
E2 of ⌊BY ⌋ and has distinct pre-images Qi for i = 1, 2, each contained in the
component of S corresponding to Ei. C := E1∩E2 is of pure dimension 1 and its
irreducible components are smooth curves. Let Ri be the unique geometric point
in the pre-image of P in Ei ⊂ E1 ⊔ E2. As π factors through the normalisation
E1 ⊔ E2 → ⌊BY ⌋, the image of Ri in S is Qi. The pre-image of C in E1 ⊔ E2 is
supported in pure dimension 1. Therefore the pre-image of C on S, CS is also
supported in pure dimension 1. If Γ is an irreducible component of C which
contains P , the pre-image Γi of Γ in Ei ⊂ E1 ⊔E2 is an irreducible curve passing
through Ri. There is a unique irreducible curve ΓS which is the pre-image of
Γ on S because π is an isomorphism away from a ﬁnite set of points. So ΓS is
the image of both Γi and it follows that ΓS must contain both Q1 and Q2. Now
let Γν be the normalisation of ΓS. The composition Γν → Γ is an isomorphism
of smooth curves, but some point has two geometric pre-images. We have a
contradiction, and so π must be a universal homeomorphism.

That S is demi-normal follows from things we know: S is nodal in codimen-
sion 1 by Lemma 5.1 and because π is an isomorphism in codimension 1, and
is S2 by deﬁnition.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.3. The conditions (1)-(6) of [15, 4.2] for adjunction to S are
satisﬁed. The only condition which is not obvious is (5), which holds because
S is demi-normal [15, 5.1]. Thus there is a diﬀerent, BS, satisfying

π∗(KY + BY ) ∼Q KS + BS

We can check discepancies to ensure this pair is slc by pulling back to the
normalisation, and applying adjunction to the individual normal components
of ⌊BY ⌋. By Tanaka’s abundance for slc surfaces [20], KS + BS is semi-ample.
Now because S → ⌊BY ⌋ is a ﬁnite universal homeomorphism, by Prop 2.4,
(KY + BY )|⌊BY ⌋ is semi-ample.
(cid:3)

6. Good Log Minimal Models

6.1. Big log divisors. In this subsection we prove Theorem 1.1, which will
allow us to contract birational extremal rays.

Proof of Theorem 1.1 in global case.

STEP 1: Take a Q-factorial dlt model.
(X, B) is a log canonical 3-fold pair such that KX + B is nef and big. Let
(Y, BY ) be a crepant Q-factorial dlt model of (X, B). We may assume ⌊BY ⌋ 6= 0
as if not, (Y, BY ) is klt and we can apply the base point free theorem. If it
were the case that E(KY + BY ) ⊆ ⌊BY ⌋, we would be able to apply Keel’s
Theorem together with the semi-ampleness result from Section 5 to conclude
the statement. However, this need not be true, so we proceed by contracting
components of E(KY + BY ) until it holds. By adapting the proof of [12, 0.5] it
is possible to show that in fact E(KY + BY ) = ∪{Curves C : KY + BY · C = 0}.
This means we should expect it to be suﬃcient to contract KY + BY -trivial
curves, although we do not use the above mentioned fact in our proof.

STEP 2: Contract KY + BY -trivial curves which intersect ⌊BY ⌋ positively.
If we choose ǫ suﬃciently small, a KY + BY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋-MMP with scaling
of ⌊BY ⌋ contracts only KY + BY -trivial extremal rays. KY + BY is big by
assumption, so we may choose ǫ suﬃciently small that KY + BY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋ is big.
Therefore this LMMP terminates by Theorem 1.6. As any step of this LMMP
is KY + BY -trivial, we claim that at each step KY + BY pulls back from some
Q-Cartier divisor on the base. This follows from the klt cone and base point
free theorems (see [17, 3.7(4)]).

Therefore this LMMP results in a model Y ′ on which the birational transform
KY ′ + BY ′ is semi-ample if and only if KY + BY is semi-ample. (Y ′, BY ′) is Q-
factorial and log canonical but may no longer be dlt. Any KY ′ +BY ′-trivial curve
cannot intersect ⌊BY ′⌋ positively: it is therefore forced to either be disjoint from
⌊BY ′⌋ or completely contained in ⌊BY ′⌋. Also, KY ′ + BY ′ − ǫ′ ⌊BY ′⌋ is nef for
all ǫ′ ∈ [0, ǫ].

STEP 3 Contract KY ′ + BY ′-trivial curves not contained in ⌊BY ′⌋.

The LMMP for log canonical 3-folds in char p

The underlying variety Y ′ is klt and Q-factorial so by Prop 2.12, we may
replace ǫ to be suﬃciently small that any KY ′ + BY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋-trivial curve is
also KY ′ + BY ′-trivial. Apply the base point free theorem on the klt KY ′ +
BY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋ to produce another KY ′ + BY ′-trivial contraction f : Y ′ → Y ′′
such that KY ′ + BY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋ ∼Q f ∗A for ample A. Notice that if 0 < ǫ′ < ǫ,
KY ′ + BY ′ − ǫ′ ⌊BY ′⌋ is also semi-ample and its associated morphism contracts
the same curves as f . Therefore KY ′ + BY ′ − ǫ′ ⌊BY ′⌋ also pulls back from Y ′′.
This implies ⌊BY ′⌋ pulls back from a Q-Cartier divisor D on Y ′′, and so

KY ′ + BY ′ does also. In particular, D = f∗ ⌊BY ′⌋ = ⌊BY ′′⌋.

We get a new log canonical pair (Y ′′, BY ′′) such that KY ′′ + BY ′′ ∼Q A + ǫD
for ample A and eﬀective D as above. This implies that E(KY ′′ + BY ′′) ⊂ D =
⌊B′′
Y ⌋, and we also know that KY ′′ + BY ′′ is semi-ample if and only if KY ′ + BY ′
is. However (Y ′′, BY ′′) is neither dlt nor Q-factorial.

STEP 4: Construct a model where Keel’s theorem applies
Let (Y ′′′, BY ′′′) be a Q-factorial dlt model of (Y ′′, BY ′′) with morphism g :
Y ′′′ → Y ′′. We claim that every irreducible component of E(KY ′′′ + BY ′′′) is
either contained within ⌊BY ′′′⌋ or is completely disjoint from it. First note that
LCS(Y ′′, BY ′′) = ⌊BY ′′⌋, because ⌊BY ′⌋ pulls back from ⌊BY ′′⌋, and LCS(Y ′, BY ′) =
⌊BY ′⌋ because (Y ′, BY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋) is klt.

To complete the proof of the claim, suppose V is an irreducible component of
E(KY ′′′ +BY ′′′) and ﬁrst assume that it is 2-dimensional. If V is contracted over
Y ′′ then it is in ⌊BY ′′′⌋ by deﬁnition of the crepant dlt Q-factorial modiﬁcation.
If it is not contracted over V then its birational transform is in E(KY ′′ +BY ′′) ⊂
⌊BY ′′⌋. So we may assume V is 1-dimensional. g∗ ⌊BY ′′⌋ is an eﬀective Q-Cartier
divisor on Y ′′′ with support equal to ⌊BY ′′′⌋ (because LCS(Y ′′, BY ′′) = ⌊BY ′′⌋),
and by projection formula V · g∗ ⌊BY ′′⌋ = 0. This implies that either V is
contained within ⌊BY ′′′⌋ or it is completely disjoint from it. This completes the
proof of the claim.

We may now apply Keel’s theorem to (Y ′′′, BY ′′′). Any connected component
of E(KY ′′′ + BY ′′′) is either contained within ⌊BY ′′′⌋ or is completely disjoint
In this ﬁrst case KY ′′′ + BY ′′′ is semi-ample when restricted to this
from it.
connected component by Theorem 1.3. In the second it is semi-ample because
in a neighbourhood of the component, KY ′′′ + BY ′′′ is equal to

KY ′′′ + BY ′′′ − ǫg∗ ⌊BY ′′⌋ = g∗(KY ′′ + BY ′′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′′⌋)

which is nef and big, and the pair (Y ′′′, BY ′′′ − ǫg∗ ⌊BY ′′⌋) is klt so we may apply
base-point freeness in the klt case.

(cid:3)

Proof of 1.1 in relative case. We now have projective contraction f : X → Z.
Let A be an ample divisor on Z. Because KX + B is big/Z, there exits n >> 0
such that KX + B + nf ∗A is big. Now using the Cone Theorem 1.7, perhaps
after increasing n, KX + B + nf ∗A is also globally nef and positive on any curve
not contracted/Z. Our ground ﬁeld is algebraically closed, so it is F -ﬁnite,
inﬁnite and perfect. By the results of [21] we can ﬁnd A′ ∼Q nf ∗A such that
(X, B + A′) is log canonical. We may now apply the global case.

6.2. Big boundary divisors. Now we move on to Theorem 1.2. The proof
follows that of Theorem 1.1 in outline, but diﬀers in detail as we must deal with
non-birational morphisms and non pseudo-eﬀective log divisors.

Proof of Theorem 1.2 in global case.

STEP 1: Pass to a dlt modiﬁcation
Let φ : Y → X be a crepant Q-factorial dlt modiﬁcation of (X, B). We claim
that we may replace A by A′ ∼Q A to assume that (X, B + A) is also lc and also
that f is a crepant Q-factorial dlt modiﬁcation of (X, B + A). To see this, note
that by [21] there is some A′′ ∼Q 2A such that (X, B + A′′) is log canonical. Set
A′ = 1
2 A′′. Any log canonical place of (X, B + A′) is then also a log canonical
place of (X, B). Now it is enough to show that KY + BY + AY is semi-ample.
Note that AY = φ∗A is also a big and semi-ample Q-divisor.

STEP 2: Run a KY + BY + AY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋-MMP with scaling of ⌊BY ⌋.
In fact, the way we choose extremal rays must be slightly more complicated
in order to achieve termination. In this step we prove that there is some choice
of such an LMMP which terminates.

Note that for ǫ suﬃciently smal any such LMMP is also a KY + BY + AY −
ǫ′ ⌊BY ⌋-MMP for ǫ′ ∈ [0, ǫ], we are free to replace ǫ by a smaller number at any
point during our MMP without aﬀecting the previous steps. We may terminate
as soon as KY + BY + AY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋ is nef for any ǫ, so every extremal ray we
contract will be KY + BY + AY -trivial.

There is some choice of KY + BY + AY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋-MMP with scaling of ⌊BY ⌋
which reaches a model ˜Y with the following property: no possible choice of
K ˜Y +B ˜Y +A ˜Y −ǫ ⌊B ˜Y ⌋ with scaling of ⌊B ˜Y ⌋ which contracts only KY +BY +AY -
trivial rays will ever contain a divisorial contraction. For if not, we could run
an LMMP containing inﬁntely many divisorial contractions. Thus, if we drop
the condition that A be semi-ample (now merely big) then we may replace Y
by ˜Y and assume that no such MMP contracts a divisor.

Let HY be an ample divisor on the new Y , such that (Y, BY + AY + HY ) is
log canonical and KY + BY + AY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋ + HY is nef. Apply Prop 2.12 to Y
within the polytope generated by BY + AY −ǫ ⌊BY ⌋, BY + AY and Y, BY + AY +
HY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋ to obtain real numbers α and δ as in Prop 2.12. By shrinking ǫ
and HY we may assume that ||∆ − (BY + AY )|| < δ for any ∆ in our polytope.
Now run a (Y, BY + AY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋)-MMP with scaling of HY . At every stage,
so long as we contract no divisor, Prop 2.12 ensures that every extremal ray
contracted is also KY + BY + AY -trivial. This means that this LMMP is also a
KY + BY + AY − ǫ ⌊BY ⌋-MMP with scaling of ⌊BY ⌋, and so by the observation
above we do indeed never contract a divisor. This LMMP terminates by klt
termination with scaling [6, Theorem 1.5], on some model Y ′, which is either a
log minimal model or a Mori ﬁbre space.

STEP 3: (Y ′, BY ′ + AY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋) is a Mori ﬁbre space.
Suppose Y ′ has KY ′ + BY ′ + AY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋-MFS structure f : Y ′ → Z, where
Z is normal. By construction f is KY ′ + BY ′ + AY ′-trivial, so the ﬁbres of f
intersect ⌊BY ′⌋ positively and there is some component Z ′ of ⌊BY ′⌋ which is
surjective to Z. By [17, 3.7(4)], KY ′ +BY ′ +AY ′ pulls back from some Q-Cartier

D on Z. (KY ′ + BY ′ + AY ′)|Z ′ = f |∗
Thus we are done in this case.

Z ′D, so by Theorem 1.3, D is semi-ample.

STEP 4: (Y ′, BY ′ + AY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋) is a log minimal model.
For a given ǫ, we may assume that KY ′ + BY ′ + AY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋ is not big by
Theorem 1.1. We may write AY ′ ∼Q C + E for some ample C and eﬀective E.
Choosing δ suﬃciently small we may ensure that

(Y ′, (BY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋) + (1 − δ)AY ′ + δE)

is klt. The basepoint free theorem for klt pairs now implies that KY ′ + BY ′ +
AY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋ is semi-ample. As in the proof of Theorem 1.1, by applying this
for various values of ǫ we obtain a contraction f : Y ′ → Z satisfying.

KY ′ + BY ′ + AY ′ − ǫ ⌊BY ′⌋ ∼Q f ∗H
KY ′ + BY ′ + AY ′ ∼Q f ∗(H + ǫD)

for some H ample on Z and D ≥ 0. We show that H + ǫD is semi-ample. If Z
has dimension less than 2 this is obvious, so we may assume it has dimension
2. E(H + ǫD) ⊂ Supp(D), and by construction f −1(Supp(D)) = ⌊BY ′⌋. Let
g : Y ′′ → Y ′ be a crepant Q-factorial dlt modiﬁcation of (Y ′, BY ′ + AY ′) with
KY ′′ + ∆ = g∗(KY ′ + BY ′ + AY ′). As Y ′ is Q-factorial and LCS(Y ′, BY ′ + AY ′) =
⌊BY ′⌋, g−1(⌊BY ′⌋) = ⌊∆⌋. Theorem 1.3 implies that (KY ′′ + ∆)|(f ◦g)−1D is semi-
ample. We may now apply the semi-ampleness criterion [6, Lemma 7.1], derived
from Keel’s theorem to deduce that H + D is semi-ample.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.2 in relative case.

As in the relative case of Theorem 1.1, if we let H be a suﬃciently ample
divisor on Z, A + H is globally ample and by the cone theorem KX + B + A + H
is globally nef. By [21]) we may replace H up to Q-linear equivalence so that
(X, B + A + H) is log canonical. Now we may apply the global case.

7. The LMMP

Next we apply Theorem 1.1 to construct ﬂips for log canonical pairs.

Proof of 1.5. Let (X, B) be a projective log canonical 3-fold pair with ﬂipping
contraction g : X → Z.

(X, B) has a Q-factorial dlt model f : Y → X where KY + BY = f ∗(KX + B)
by 2.11. Run an LMMP/Z for (Y, BY ). If A is ample on Z, KY +BY +nf ∗g∗A is
big for n >> 0 and so the LMMP terminates on a log minimal model (Y +, BY +)
by Theorem 1.6. By Theorem 1.1, KY + + BY + is semi-ample/Z. It therefore
has a log canonical model (X +, B+)/Z, which we show is the ﬂip of (X/Z, B).
It suﬃces to show that no divisors are contracted by X + 99K X as KX + +BX +

is ample/Z.

Let φ : W → X and φ+ : W → X + be a common resolution.

L = φ∗(KX + B) − φ+∗(KX + + BX +)

is anti-nef/Z and so by the negativity lemma is eﬀective and non-zero. By
deﬁnition of BX + if there were an exceptional component of X + 99K X, L

14

would have zero coeﬃcient in that component. But also L is negative on some
curve within any such component, which would be impossible.
(cid:3)

Next we prove the contraction theorem:

Proof of Cor 1.4. Let A be ample on X. For ǫ ∈ Q suﬃciently small, R is also
KX + B + ǫA negative. By the Cone Theorem 1.7 there are only ﬁnitely many
KX + B + ǫA-negative extremal rays. Therefore we may ﬁnd a functional H
on NE1(X) such that R is the only H-negative ray. We may also assume that
A′ = H − (KX + B + ǫA) is ample (i.e. positive on all of NE 1(X)), and perturb
H slightly to assume this is a Q-divisor. So we may replace A by A′ + ǫA such
that R is the only KX + B + A-negative extremal ray.

Let λ = inf{t : KX + B + tA is nef} (so λ > 1). KX + B + λA is positive
wherever KX + B is non-negative, and also positive on every extremal KX + B-
negative extremal ray except R. This means the extremal face (KX +B +λA)=0
must be R itself. R contains a rational curve C, and KX +B·C = −λA·C. Both
−A · C and the left hand side are negative rational numbers, so λ is rational
and KX + B + λA is a Q-divisor.

By [21] there is a Q-divisor A′ ∼Q λA such that (X, B + A′) is log canonical.
(cid:3)

Theorem 1.2 applied to the pair (X, B + A′) gives the result.

Proof of Corollary 1.8. This is a consequence of all our other results. Given a
log canonical pair (X, B) such that KX + B is not nef, we may ﬁnd a KX + B-
negative extremal ray using Theorem 1.7. There is a projective contraction
contracting the curves in this ray by Corollary 1.4. If it is a ﬂipping contraction,
the ﬂip exists by Corollary 13. Finally if KX + B ≡ M ≥ 0 the program
terminates by Theorem 1.6.
