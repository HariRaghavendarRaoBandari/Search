Abstract

In quantum ﬁeld theory, bare particles are dressed by a cloud of virtual particles to form phys-

ical particles. The virtual particles aﬀect properties such as the mass and charge of the physical

particles, and it is only these modiﬁed properties that can be measured in experiments, not the

properties of the bare particles. The inﬂuence of virtual particles is prominent in the ultrastrong-

coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has recently been realized in

several condensed-matter systems.

In some of these systems, the eﬀective interaction between

atom-like transitions and the cavity photons can be switched on or oﬀ by external control pulses.

This oﬀers unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum ﬂuctuations and the relation

between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying external electromagnetic

pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in

cavity-QED systems can be converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this

way, the hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes experimen-

tally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons can be clearly pictured using

Feynman diagrams with cut loops.

INTRODUCTION

In quantum ﬁeld theory, the creation and annihilation operators in the Lagrangian de-

scribe the creation and destruction of bare particles which, however, cannot be directly

observed in experiments (see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2]). Bare particles, due to the interaction terms

in the Lagrangian, are actually dressed by virtual particles and become real physical par-

ticles which can be detected. The interaction modiﬁes the properties of the particles, e.g.,

giving rise to the Lamb shift of electronic energy levels [3, 4] and aﬀecting the charge, mass,

and magnetic moment of the electron [1, 5, 6]. The predictions of the theory must be ex-

pressed in terms of the properties of the physical particles, not of the non-interacting (or

bare) particles [1, 2]. The relations between the bare and the physical particles, like the bare

particles themselves, are unobservable.

The inﬂuence of virtual particles features prominently in the ultrastrong coupling (USC)

regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) [7, 8]. In cavity QED [9], the interaction

between light conﬁned in a reﬂective cavity and natural or artiﬁcial atoms is studied in con-

ditions where the quantum nature of light is important. The system enters the USC regime

when the light-matter coupling rate becomes an appreciable fraction of the unperturbed

resonance frequencies of the photons and the atom. In this regime, the routinely-invoked

rotating wave approximation (RWA) is no longer applicable and the nonresonant terms in

the light-matter interaction signiﬁcantly change the standard cavity QED scenarios [7, 8, 10–

21]. Recently, the USC regime has been reached experimentally in a variety of solid-state

systems and spectral ranges [22–31].

The need to account for virtual particles in the USC regime of cavity QED is exempliﬁed

by the fact that the correct description of the output photon ﬂux from the cavity, as well as

of higher-order Glauber normal-order correlation functions, requires a proper generalization

of input-output theory [15]. Due to the contribution from counter-rotating terms in the
interaction Hamiltonian, the ground state |E0i of the system contains a ﬁnite number of
photons [32], i.e.,

E 6= 0, where ˆa and ˆa† are the annihilation and creation

operators for the cavity mode. However, the ground state cannot emit energy, so the output

E

Dˆa†ˆa

photon ﬂux cannot be proportional to

, as in standard input-output theory. Instead, it

has been shown [15, 33] that the cavity output (which can be detected by a photo-absorber)
is proportional to hˆx−ˆx+i, where ˆx+ is the positive frequency component of the quadrature

2

operator ˆx = ˆa+ˆa† and ˆx− = (ˆx+)†. Since hE0 |ˆx−ˆx+| E0i = 0, the photons that contribute to
the ground state are not physical observable particles, but virtual ones. Furthermore, also the

(physical) system excitations are enriched by unobservable virtual particles. For instance, the

ﬁrst excited state, corresponding to a single physical particle, may contain contributions from

an odd number of virtual particles. All these virtual contributions, however, are signiﬁcant

only in the USC regime, not at weaker coupling strengths.

In QED, the modiﬁcations of the electron properties due to the interaction with virtual

particles are known as radiative corrections [1]. In addition to the diagrams describing the

processes in lowest order of perturbation theory, the Feynman diagrams representing the

radiative corrections to a process contain additional vertices (loop diagrams), corresponding

to the emission and re-absorption of virtual photons. Here we show that, analogously, the

energy corrections to the ground state and to the excited states of a cavity-QED system

in the USC regime are described by loop diagrams corresponding to the emission and re-

absorption of virtual photons.

An interesting feature of these condensed-matter systems is that the eﬀective interaction

between atom-like transitions and the cavity ﬁeld can be switched on and oﬀ by applying

external drives. This oﬀers the opportunity to convert the virtual excitations into real

particles which can be detected. Both spontaneous [7] and stimulated [34] conversion of

virtual photons from the ground state of a cavity QED system in the USC regime have

recently been analyzed . Also, virtual photon pairs are converted into real ones in the

dynamical Casimir eﬀect (DCE) [35], which has been analyzed for [36–38] and experimentally

demonstrated [39] in circuit QED. Potentially, a proper modulation of the mirror in a DCE

setup could also allow for absorption of photon pairs [40].

In contrast to these previous

works, we here show how to convert various numbers of virtual photons into real ones and

back, both for the dressed vacuum state and for a dressed excited states. We show that the

corresponding Feynman diagrams can be obtained by cutting the loop diagrams describing

the energy correction of a physical excitation. Speciﬁcally, conversion of virtual photons

dressing a physical excitation into real ones is described by the ﬁrst half of cut loop-diagrams

(photon emission). Similarly, the conversion of real photons back into virtual ones bound

to a physical excitation corresponds to the second half (photon absorption). Moreover, the

proposed scheme, does not need ultrafast modulation of boundary conditions and it can give

rise to a conversion probability close to one.

II. RESULTS

A. The Rabi model

The simplest cavity-QED model beyond the RWA is the quantum Rabi model [41, 42].
The Hamiltonian is ( = 1) ˆHR = ˆH0 + ˆV , where ˆH0 = ωc ˆa†ˆa + ωe |eihe| + ωg |gihg| is the
bare Hamiltonian in the absence of interaction. Here, ˆa and ˆa† are the photon destruction
and creation operators for the cavity mode with resonance frequency ωc, |gi and |ei are
the ground and excited atomic states, respectively, and ωe(g) are the corresponding energy

eigenvalues. The interaction Hamiltonian is

ˆV = ΩR

(cid:16)ˆa† + ˆa

(cid:17) ˆσx,

(1)

where ΩR is the coupling strength and ˆσx = ˆσ+ + ˆσ− = |eihg| + |gihe|. When ωc ≈ ωeg ≡
ωe − ωg, the interaction Hamiltonian can be separated into a resonant and a nonresonant
part: ˆV = ˆVr+ ˆVnr, where ˆVr = ΩR(ˆa†ˆσ−+ˆaˆσ+), and ˆVnr = ΩR(ˆa†ˆσ++ˆaˆσ−). The nonresonant
terms do not conserve energy nor the number of excitations. They can be neglected when
ΩR/(ωc + ωeg) (cid:28) 1.

The interaction Hamiltonian has a structure which is very similar to that of the QED

interaction potential, although it is less complicated. The Rabi model can be viewed as a

very simple QED system, where there is only a single photon mode and a two-state electron.

As a consequence, we would expect that Feynman diagrams for the Rabi Hamiltonian will

be a simpliﬁed version of QED diagrams. One such diagram, for the nonresonant transition
|g, 0i → |e, 1i (the second entry in the ket denotes the photon number), is shown in Fig. 1a.
However, some care must be taken when drawing diagrams for processes involving more

than one photon in the same mode [43], which occur in cavity QED. Stimulated emission

[44], the mechanism behind laser action, is one such process.
It is a one-photon process
|e, ni → |g, n+1i, where the n photons in the initial state stimulate the downward transition
of the atom, aﬀecting the transition rate which becomes proportional to n + 1. This factor

must be included in the rules for the diagrams in order for calculations to be correct. An
example of a diagram showing the stimulated-emission process |e, 1i → |g, 2i is presented in
Fig. 1b. A more detailed discussion about diagrams for stimulated emission can be found in

the Supplementary Material.

and green for |gi, represent the qubit states and the wavy lines the cavity photons. (a) Diagram

to mark nonresonant processes. (b) Diagram for the transition |e, 1i → |g, 2i. This is a resonant
process, induced by the term ˆa†ˆσ−, marked by an empty vertex. For a process with stimulated

emission, such as this one, each photon involved is represented by a separate wavy line. This is the

convention used in the rest of this article.

B. Bare vs physical excitations

Owing to the presence of ˆVnr in the Rabi Hamiltonian, the operator describing the total
number of excitations, ˆN = ˆa†ˆa + |eihe|, does not commute with ˆHR and as a consequence
the eigenstates of ˆHR do not have a deﬁnite number of excitations [32]. When ˆVnr can
be neglected, the Hamiltonian becomes block-diagonal and easy to diagonalize (this is the

Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model [45]). The resulting eigenstates can be labelled according

to their deﬁnite number of excitations n. The ground state (zero excitations) is simply
n i, obtained by diagonalization of 2 × 2
|E0i = |g, 0i, and the n ≥ 1 excitation states |E±
subspaces, can be written as

|E+
n i = Cn|g, ni + Sn|e, n − 1i

|E−
n i = −Sn|g, ni + Cn|e, n − 1i,

(2)
where Cn and Sn are amplitudes determined by ΩR and the detuning ωc−ωeg. The eigenstates
|Eii of the full Rabi Hamiltonian, however, are expressed as a superposition of bare states
with varying numbers of bare excitations (see, e.g., Ref. [33]):

|Eii =

e,k are determined by ΩR, ωc and ωeg. When ΩR (cid:28) ωc, ωeg,

if the eigenstates of ˆHR are labelled accord-
ing to their eigenvalues such that Ek > Ej
for k > j. As expected, we ﬁnd that
hE0 |ˆx−(t)ˆx+(t)| E0i = 0, which demonstrates that the photonic Fock states enriching the
Rabi ground state are actually virtual. This reasoning can be generalized to the excited

states of the system. For the ﬁrst excited state, the one-photon correlation is diﬀerent
from zero (hE1 |ˆx−(t)ˆx+(t)| E1i 6= 0). However, the output coincidence rate from this state,
proportional to the physical two-photon correlation function hE1 |(ˆx−)2(ˆx+)2| E1i, is equal
to zero. On the contrary, the correlation functions for n ≥ 2 bare photons in the ﬁrst excited
state are diﬀerent from zero (e.g.,

E 6= 0). We can conclude that |E1i is a

single physical excitation which, however, is enriched by a larger number of virtual photons.

C. Energy corrections and loop diagrams

The analytical spectrum of HR is deﬁned in terms of the power series of a transcendental

function [42]. Approximate forms, which may provide more insight, can be derived by a

perturbative approach (see, e.g., Ref. [46]). Let us consider the correction to the ground
state energy ∆0 ≡ E0 − E0. The lowest-order (in the nonresonant potential) contribution
can be expressed as

0 =D

(5)
where ˆG(z) = (z − ˆH0 + ˆVr)−1 is the JC Green’s function. The Green’s function ˆG(z) can
be directly calculated by using the JC eigenstates from Eq. (2). Alternatively, it can be

expressed in a Dyson series containing ˆVr and the Green’s function ˆG0(z) = (z − ˆH0)−1 in
the absence of interaction: ˆG = ˆG0 + ˆG0 ˆVr ˆG0 + ˆG0 ˆVr ˆG0 ˆVr ˆG0 + . . . . Equation (5) can thus
be expanded as

A direct inspection of the terms in the series shows that only the terms with an even number

of Vr are diﬀerent from zero. It is possible to associate a diagram with each of the terms in the

series appearing in Eq. (26). Figure 2a shows the ﬁrst three diagrams providing a nonzero

contribution. The ﬁrst corresponds to the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (26). The second

diagram describes the third term in the series:

since we considered only the lowest-order corrections in the nonresonant potential. Four and

more photon waves arise when going beyond second-order perturbation theory.

This approach can also be applied to the excited states. Considering the ﬁrst excited

The mean value over the state |g, 1i in Eq. (34) can be expanded by exploiting the Dyson
series. The corresponding ﬁrst three diagrams providing a nonzero contribution are displayed

in Fig. 2b. In the diagrams we ﬁnd internal loops where two or three virtual photons are

created and ﬁnally reabsorbed. The initial and ﬁnal physical states, however, only contain a
one-photon wave. The energy corrections ∆(2)
can be easily evaluated by directly
using ˆG(z) or by summing up the inﬁnite contributions arising from the Dyson series and
described by the diagrams. These calculations, and a comparison between the approximate

analytical energy corrections and the corresponding nonperturbative numerical calculations,

can be found in the Supplementary Material.

D. Three-level atom

We now consider a system consisting of a single-mode cavity interacting with the upper
two levels |ei and |gi of a three-level atom. The energy diﬀerence Egs between the bottom
level |si and the middle level |gi is assumed to be much larger than the cavity-mode resonance
frequency such that the cavity does not interact with the atom in the lowest energy state |si
(see Fig. 3a). As we will show, the additional state |si enables an eﬀective on/oﬀ-switch of
the atom-cavity interaction. The system Hamiltonian is simply ˆHC = ˆHR + ωs |sihs|. This
Hamiltonian is block-diagonal and its eigenstates can be separated into a non-interacting
sector |s, ni, with energy ωs + nωc, where n labels the cavity photon number, and dressed
atom-cavity states |Eii, resulting from the diagonalization of the Rabi Hamiltonian (see
Fig. 3b).

The direct excitation of the atom by applied electromagnetic pulses is described by the

Hamiltonian

ˆHd = Ed(t)( ˆVsg + ˆVse),

8

(8)

Figure 3.
(a) Schematic of the system in which a three-level atom is placed in a cavity. The
upper two levels |ei and |gi of the atom resonantly couple to a single cavity mode. The eﬀective

atom-cavity interaction can be controlled by external electromagnetic pulses (arrow with a gaussian
pulse) inducing transitions from the cavity-interacting levels |gi and |ei to the noninteracting level
|si and vice versa. These pulses can induce the emission of photons (red arrows) enriching the

ground or the excited states of the Rabi Hamiltonian. (b) Lowest energy-levels of the system as a
function of the normalized coupling strength ΩR/ωc and the transitions stimulated by the external

where ˆVsg = µsg(|gihs| + |sihg|), ˆVse = µse(|eihs| + |sihe|), and µsg and µse are the dipole
moments (here assumed to be real) for the transitions |si ↔ |gi and |si ↔ |ei, respectively.
We consider quasi-monochromatic pulses Ed(t) = A(t) cos(ωt), where A(t) is a Gaussian
envelope. We only consider pulses which are out of resonance with the transition |gi ↔ |ei

Thus ˆHd applied to a dressed state is able to convert the virtual photons enriching the
physical excitations into real ones which can be detected. This is possible because ˆHd induces
transitions from the atomic states |gi and |ei (coupled to the cavity) to the noninteracting
state |si. Of course, the transitions only occur if the driving-ﬁeld frequency ω is resonant
with the corresponding transition frequency. In the absence of counter-rotating terms, a JC

eigenstate with n excitations can only undergo transitions towards states with n photons:
|E±

n i → |s, ni (for µsg 6= 0), or n − 1 photons: |E±

n i → |s, n − 1i (for µse 6= 0).

E. Stimulated emission and reabsorption of virtual particles

We ﬁrst consider the system prepared in the ground state |E0i of the Rabi Hamiltonian.
An input pulse of central frequency ω ’ E0 − ωs − 2ωc can induce a transition |E0i → |s, 2i,
corresponding to a stimulated emission process (see Fig. 3b). The corresponding matrix

crosses represent the action of the perturbation ˆVsg. These Feynman diagrams provide a clear
interpretation of the emission process. The loops in Fig. 2 contain virtual photons which
contribute to the energy correction of the state |E0i and |E1i. As shown in Fig. 4, the time-
dependent perturbation ˆVsg is able to cut these loops. These diagrams show that the virtual
photons in the loops are not just a technical feature of perturbation theory but describes

internal physical processes, which can be interrupted by a suitable perturbation able to

Fig. 4a together with the rightward time-arrow describe the transition |E0i → |s, 2i, where
two cavity photons are emitted. The same diagrams, but with a leftward time-arrow, describe
the transition |s, 2i → |E0i, where two cavity photons are reabsorbed into the Rabi ground
state. The potential ˆVsg induces the breaking of two-photon loops, converting virtual photon
pairs into real ones. It is not able, however, to break one-photon loops. These can be broken
by the potential ˆVse as shown below.

It is even more interesting to undress the excited states of the Rabi model. This can

provide access to the relationship between bare and physical excitations. Let us consider the
lowest-energy excited state |E1i which, as we have shown above, is a single-particle state.

The analytical perturbative calculations of the matrix elements

are described in the Supplementary Material.

We complete the above analysis by presenting nonperturbative numerical calculations

which accurately describe the dynamics of the undressing and re-dressing of the Rabi vacuum

and of the Rabi lowest-energy excitation. We take into account the presence of dissipation

channels, the presence of higher energy levels, and the non-monochromaticity of the driving

numerically solving the master equation ˙ˆρ(t) = i[ˆρ(t), ˆHC] +P
pulses. All the dynamical evolutions displayed in Figs. 4c and 4d have been calculated
ˆLj ˆρ(t) [33, 47, 48], where
ˆLj are Liouvillian superoperators describing the diﬀerent (atomic and photonic) dissipation
channels. All calculations have been carried out with zero-temperature reservoirs.

We consider the system initially prepared in the state |E0i (preparation starting from
the ground state |s, 0i can be easily achieved by sending a suitable π pulse). Then, a
Gaussian pulse with central frequency ω = E0−ωs−2ωc induces the transition |E0i → |s, 2i.
Speciﬁcally, the pulse area required to obtain a complete transition is π/

Figure 4c displays the dynamics of the intracavity mean excitation number hˆx−ˆx+i, which is
directly related to the output photon ﬂux Φout(t) = γc hˆx−(t)ˆx+(t)i (where γc is the photon
escape rate through the cavity boundary), as well as the equal-time second-order correlation
function G(2)(t) = h(ˆx−(t))2(ˆx+(t))2i. Before the arrival of the Gaussian pulse (shaded red
curve), the output photon ﬂux is zero, since hE0 |ˆx−ˆx+| E0i = 0. After the arrival of the
pulse, the photon ﬂux becomes nonzero and G(2)(t) ’ hˆx−ˆx+i, conﬁrming that a two-photon
state is actually generated as expected from the diagrams in Fig. 4a. When a second pulse
is sent, the two photons are reabsorbed into the Rabi ground state: |s, 2i → |E0i (diagrams
in Fig. 4a with the leftward time-arrow). Figure 4c shows that a residual small excitation

remains in the system after the arrival of the second pulse. This can be attributed to the

inﬂuence of damping and to a non-negligible transition probability to higher-energy levels

induced by the tails of the pulse spectrum.

Figure 4d displays the dynamics starting from the system prepared in the state |E1i. We
observe that, after the arrival of the Gaussian pulse (with central frequency ω = E1−ωs−3ωc
and area π/

E(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)), the initial zero third-order correlation function G(3) approaches

6, the value corresponding to a three-photon state. This result conﬁrms the occurrence of
the transition |E1i → |s, 3i. Also in this case, the emitted photons are reabsorbed by
sending an additional identical Gaussian pulse. We observe that, within the standard RWA,
hE1 |ˆx−(t)ˆx+(t)| E1i = 1. Figure 4d at t = 0 displays a higher value. This is a peculiar
eﬀect of the USC regime, where the intracavity mean excitation number is quadrature-
dependent. In particular, it increases for ˆx measurements and decreases for measurements
of the conjugate quadrature ˆy = i(ˆa† − ˆa).

Having studied above processes with ˆVse, we now turn to those involving ˆVse instead.
Figure 5 shows these processes, with the action of ˆVse represented in the diagrams by blue
crosses. These processes are able to break one-photon loops, as illustrated in Fig. 5a, which
shows the diagrams associated with the transition |E0i → |s, 1i, where a cavity photon is
emitted (rightward time-arrow) and reabsorbed (leftward time-arrow). Figure 5b shows the
diagrams associated with the transitions |E1i ↔ |s, 2i, where two photons enriching the

coupling strength ΩR/ωc = 0.15 is suﬃcient to break one-, two- and three-photon loops,
converting virtual photons into real ones with probability close to one. This value of the

coupling strength is roughly equal to the experimentally demonstrated values in circuit-QED

systems [23]. Very recently, by making use of the macroscopic magnetic dipole moment of

a ﬂux qubit, large zero-point-ﬂuctuation current of an LC oscillator, and large Josephson
inductance of a coupler junction, quantum circuits where ΩR/ωeg ranges from 0.72 to 1.34,
have been realized [49].

III. DISCUSSION

The results presented here show that the USC regime of cavity QED can be exploited

to observe, in a direct way, how interactions dress observed particles by a cloud of virtual

particles. Such particle dressing is a general feature of quantum ﬁeld theory and many-body

quantum systems. We have shown that, by applying external electromagnetic pulses of

suitable amplitude and frequency, each virtual photon enriching a physical excitation can be

converted into a physical observable photon. In this way, the hidden relationship between

the bare and physical excitations can be unravelled and becomes experimentally testable.

We have shown that the Feynman diagrams describing the photon emission from a phys-

ical excitation are closely linked to the loop diagrams describing the energy correction of

a physical excitation induced by the interaction. These loop or bubble diagrams describe

internal processes where virtual photons are created and reabsorbed. The diagrams describ-

ing the conversion of virtual photons, dressing a physical excitation, into real ones can be

obtained by cutting the loop diagrams describing energy corrections and taking the ﬁrst half

as corresponding to the creation of photons. Moreover, the stimulated reabsorption of real

15

photons into the physical excitation, converting them to virtual photons, corresponds to the

second half of the loop diagrams.

We limited our analysis to the dressed vacuum and to a one-particle state. It can be

easily extended to study higher-energy excitations. Moreover, we considered only processes

up to second-order perturbation theory. The present analysis can be generalized to describe

higher-order processes, involving more than three photons, which can take place if the light-

matter interaction is suﬃciently strong [49].

The most promising candidates for an experimental realization of the proposed stimulated

conversion eﬀects are superconducting quantum circuits and intersubband quantum-well po-

laritons. In particular, phase-biased ﬂux qubits can reach the USC regime in circuit QED

[50], as has been shown in experiments [23, 49, 51]. By adjusting the externally applied

magnetic ﬂux, these artiﬁcial atoms can acquire both the quantized level structure and the

transition matrix elements required for the observation of the stimulated emission and re-

absorption of virtual particles [7]. The USC regime can also be reached for intersubband

transitions in undoped quantum wells [52]. In this system, an optical resonator in the ter-

ahertz spectral range is resonantly coupled to transitions between the two-lowest energy

conduction subbands of a large number of identical undoped quantum wells. In this case,
the upper valence subband plays the role of the lowest energy state |si (see Fig. 3). Ul-
trafast optical pulses can induce transitions between the valence and conduction subbands

prompting the conversion from virtual to real photons and vice versa. Such experiments,

being able to look inside the loops of Feynman diagrams, would provide deep insight into

fundamental aspects of interaction processes in QFT.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

In this Supplementary Material, we ﬁrst restate some properties of the Rabi model and

its diagrammatic representation, expanding on the discussion in the main text. We then

proceed to explicitly calculate analytically the second-order correction to the lowest energy

eigenvalues and comparing them to full numerical calculations. We also calculate matrix

elements associated with the external drive used to stimulate the emission and reabsorption

of the virtual particles dressing the excitations in the system.

A. Hamiltonian and basic diagrams

The interaction Hamiltonian of the Rabi model is

(cid:16)ˆa† + ˆa

(cid:17) ˆσx,

ˆV = ΩR

(12)
where ΩR is the coupling strength and ˆσx = ˆσ+ + ˆσ− = |eihg| + |gihe|. Referring to
the case ωc ≈ ωeg ≡ ωe − ωg, the interaction Hamiltonian can be separated into a reso-
nant and a nonresonant contribution: ˆV = ˆVr + ˆVnr, where ˆVr = ΩR
, and
ˆVnr = ΩR
of the QED interaction potential, although it is simpler. The Rabi model can be viewed

. This interaction term has a structure which is very similar to that

(cid:16)ˆa†ˆσ− + ˆaˆσ+

(cid:17)

(cid:16)ˆa†ˆσ+ + ˆaˆσ−

(cid:17)

as a prototypical QED system where there is only one photon mode and a two-state elec-

tron. Therefore, we expect that the Feynman diagrams for the Rabi Hamiltonian will be a

simpliﬁed version of the QED diagrams.

As in QED, there is only one vertex type with three lines: One wavy (photonic) line, one

solid line with an incoming arrow, and one solid line with an outgoing arrow. The vertices (of

the same type) corresponding to the four terms in the interaction Hamiltonian are displayed

in Fig. 6. The upper diagram in Fig. 6a describes the spontaneous emission process and the

lower one the absorption process. Starting from these four building blocks, it is possible to

describe higher-order processes as in QED. However, in cavity QED there are processes that

are not described in a complete way by Feynman diagrams directly derived from this form

of the interaction Hamiltonian. Speciﬁcally, the presence of a resonator supporting discrete

modes opens up the possibility of observing processes involving more than one photon in

the same mode. Stimulated emission, the process underlying laser action, is one of these.
It is a one-photon process |e, ni → |g, n + 1i, where, however, the n photons in the initial

state stimulate the downward transition of the atom, aﬀecting the transition rate which
becomes proportional to n + 1. The Feynman diagram describing the process is the same
one describing spontaneous emission (n = 0), shown in Fig. 6a. However, the transition rate
for stimulated emission is n + 1 times larger than that of spontaneous emission. Hence the

Feynman diagram in the absence of additional rules is not able to determine uniquely the

transition amplitude for this process.

A possible solution is to expand the photon creation and destruction operators in Eq. (12)

in the Fock basis. The resulting interaction operator is

shown in Fig. 7a: the wavy lines describe the incoming and the outgoing photon states,

while the continuous line with the arrows describes the incoming and outgoing electronic

states. The vertex in Fig. 7a describes a stimulated emission process. Since the photon wavy

lines are labelled by the photon number, an alternative (perhaps more visual) way to draw

diagrams is to drop the photon label and draw a wavy line for each incoming or outgoing
photon line as shown in Fig. 7b. In this case, the vertices will have nin = n incoming and
nout = n ± 1 outgoing wavy lines. Each vertex (full/empty circle) contributes with a factor

C. Additional perturbation ˆVsg allowing transitions from |gi to |si

Using Eq. (15), the correction to the JC eigenstate |Eni up to the ﬁrst order in the

nonresonant potential becomes,

ˆG(En) ˆVnr|Eni.

We now consider the direct excitation of the artiﬁcial atom by applied electromagnetic

pulses, described by the Hamiltonian

ˆHd = E(t)( ˆVsg + ˆVse),

(40)

where ˆVsg = µsg(|gihs| + |sihg|), ˆVse = µse(|eihs| + |sihe|), and µsg and µse are the dipole
moments (here assumed to be real) for the transitions |si ↔ |gi and |si ↔ |ei, respectively.
First, we consider the case with the system prepared in the state |E0i = |g, 0i. The
time-dependent perturbation can induce additional transitions whose rate can be evaluated

with the Fermi golden rule.

In the absence of the counter-rotating interaction terms ˆVnr, ˆHd can induce only zero-
cavity-photon transitions |g, 0i ↔ |s, 0i. When including the counter-rotating terms, addi-
tional transitions are activated. For example, the transition |E0i ↔ |s, 2i acquires a nonzero
, where |E0i is the lowest energy state of the Rabi Hamilto-
matrix element
nian. It can be calculated perturbatively in ˆVnr, approximating |E0i to ﬁrst order in ˆVnr (see

This comparison conﬁrms the validity of the approximate diagrammatic approach.

D. Additional perturbation ˆVse allowing transitions from |ei to |si

We now consider a situation analogous to that analyzed before. In this case, a transition
|si ↔ |ei is detuned at a much higher energy than the cavity resonance. The part of
the time-dependent potential inducing the |si ↔ |ei transitions is ˆV 0(t) = E(t) ˆVse. In the
absence of the counter-rotating interaction terms ˆVnr, ˆV 0(t) can induce zero-cavity-photon
transitions |e, 0i ↔ |s, 0i.

In the presence of ˆVnr, additional transitions, such as |E0i ↔ |s, 1i, can be activated. The
. It can be calculated perturbatively in

matrix element for this transition is

E. Calculation of the ˆG matrix elements using the Dyson equation

Here we perform all the calculations for the determination of the correction to the self-
energy to second order in ˆVnr. We have to sum all the elements of the inﬁnite series. The
generic matrix element is

(53)
We observe that when ˆVr appears an odd number of times, then the matrix element will be
zero, i.e.,

.
