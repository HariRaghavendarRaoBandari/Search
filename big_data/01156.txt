A diﬀusion driven curvature ﬂow

E. Baspinar∗

G. Citti†∗

Introduction

Geometrical ﬂow is the evolution of a surface Σ0 ⊂ Rn whose points move with speed equal to a
function of the mean curvature and direction normal to the evolving surface Σt ⊂ Rn. In particular
mean curvature ﬂow has been studied by several authors such as Altschuler-Grayson [1], [14], Gage-
Hamilton [18], Grayson [22] and Huisken [23] who exploited parametric methods of diﬀerential
geometry. For an overview on other geometrical ﬂows we refer to [19, 20, 29].

However the parametric methods were insuﬃcient if singularities occur during mean curvature
ﬂow. In order to handle such diﬃculties Brakke [6] employed varifold approach via geometric measure
theory and provided weak solutions to the mean curvature ﬂow. Furthermore, Osher-Sethian [31]
used level set approach in numerical studies and later Evans-Spruck [17] and Chen-Giga-Goto [10]
extended level set approach in combination with the theory of viscosity solutions in order to provide
generalized weak solutions to mean curvature evolution PDE.

Here we will be interested in motion by curvature of surfaces which are expressed as a graph
x = (x′, γ(x′)) ∈ Rn of a smooth function γ : Rn−1 → R. In this case the curvature is expressed as

A special class of curvature equations, which contains the motion by curvature is

Bence-Merriman-Osher [30] provided a numerical algorithm which expresses the motion by cur-
vature as a two step procedure with diﬀusion and recovery of the surface. They started with a surface
Σ0 which was the boundary of a set C0 and applied heat diﬀusion to the characteristic function χC0
of the set C0 for a ﬁxed interval of time [0, T ]:

(ut = ∆u in Rn × (0,∞)
u = χC0 on Rn × {t = 0}.

At time T > 0 they recovered a new set as

C1 = H(T )C0 ≡ {x ∈ Rn : u(x, T ) ≥

1
2}.

(2)

Applying iteratively this procedure, Bence-Merriman-Osher generated a sequence of sets (Cj ) and
conjectured in [30] that their boundaries Σj evolved by mean curvature ﬂow. The convergence
of the algorithm to mean curvature ﬂow was proven by Evans [16], Barles-Georglin [4], Ishii [24],
Ishii-Pires-Souganidis [26], Vivier [36], Leoni [28] and Goto-Ishii-Ogawa [21].

In his proof, Evans applied a level set approach. The sets Cj were identiﬁed with sub-level sets
of functions fj, and expressed as Cj = {x ∈ Rn : fj(x) ≥ λ ≥ 0}. Accordingly the operator H
in (1) is rewritten as an operator acting on continuous functions. Then with general instruments
of nonlinear semigroup theory, he proved that for every f0 in the domain of the curvature operator
and for every t ≥ 0, the iterative application of the algorithm, converges to the solution of mean
curvature ﬂow. Formally, there exists the limit

lim
j→∞

j(cid:19)j
H(cid:18) t

f0,

and it coincides with the motion by curvature of the level sets of the function f0. The proof was
extended to motion of graphs by curvature in Carnot groups in [9].

A generalization of Bence-Merriman-Osher algorithm was proposed in [11]. This version of the
algorithm was inspired by the behavior of simple cells of the visual cortex, and their ability of
completion of corrupted parts of images. In the original version, this alogrithm allows a surface and
a density function deﬁned on it to evolve at the same time. Calling u the evolution in time of a
measure concentrated on the surface, they deﬁned a new surface as the zero level-set of the gradient
of u along normal direction. The authors proposed that Σj(t/j) converges to a solution of the mean
curvature ﬂow, and provided a local approximation result. However a complete proof is still missing.

Hence we modify the algorithm of [11], introducing a geometrical correction in the initial datum,
and we provide a complete proof of its convergence. Motivated by the applied problem we consider
evolution of surfaces which are graphs given by

We ﬁrst apply heat diﬀusion in an interval [0, T ] of time

Σt = (x′, γ(x′)) ⊂ Rn.

(∂tu = ∆u in Rn × (0,∞)
u =< ν, r > δΣ0 on Σ0 × {t = 0},

(3)

and then deﬁne the new surface at t = T as the zero level set of the gradient along some direction
via

Σ1 := {x ∈ Rn : ∇ru(x, t) = 0},

(4)

where r is a ﬁxed unit vector. If r = en, the last element of the canonical basis, we can prove that
Σ1 is the graph of a new function γ = H(t)f0. Then the same procedure can be iterated.

We provide here a complete proof of the convergence of this algorithm to the solution of the

curvature ﬂow:

where prime denotes the ﬁrst (n − 1) components of the corresponding terms here and everywhere
it appears from now on.

Precisely, in the special case where r = en our main result can be stated as follows:

Theorem 1.1. If f0 is a continuous and periodic function, and γ is the unique solution to (1), with
F (1 + |∇γ|2) = (1 + |∇γ|2)3/2 and initial datum f0, then

γ(x′, t) = lim
j→∞

uniformly for x′ ∈ Σ′

t and t ≥ 0 in compact sets.

The peculiarity of the algorithm proposed in [11] relies on the fact that it models the behavior of
the cells of the visual cortex, and it can be used to implement a surface completion algorithm. Both
those properties are preserved in our algorithm (as explained in (1) and (1)) through the geometric
modiﬁcation on the initial function. In addition, a minimization in a ﬁxed direction is simpler to
implement than the minimization in the normal direction. Furthermore the special case with r = en
is particularly important since it complies with the direction in which the graph function is deﬁned,
thus with orientation selectivity of simple cells as described by the visual cortex model. The proof of
convergence of our algorithm is partially inspired by the proof of Evans [16], but we deeply simplify
it, since we study in a graph setting.

In section 2 we recall the main instruments of nonlinear semigroup theory necessary for the proof
In particular we will see a

of Theorem 1.1, and the weak deﬁnition of viscosity solution of (1).
general deﬁnition of the curvature operator

A(γ) = F (1 + |∇γ|2)K

.

In section 3 we show that the operator H is contractive.
In section 4 we study the local behavior of our algorithm, showing that each point of the surface

moves in normal direction with a speed equal to A(γ)/(1 + |∇γ|2).
Proofs of sections 3 and 4 are the novel parts of the paper, and they are more delicate than the
previous ones of Evans [16], since the initial datum is given only on a surface. Indeed Citti-Sarti
surface completion model [11] motivates the choice of the geometrically modiﬁed density function
< ν, r > δΣ0 on the surface Σ0 as the initial function.

Finally in section 5 we conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1, applying a general theorem of Brezis

and Pazy [7], which is given as follows:

Theorem 1.2. Suppose that there exists a family of contractive operators {H(t)}t≥0 satisfying

(I + λA)−1f = lim

t→0+(cid:18)I + λt−1(I − H(t))(cid:19)−1

f,

(6)

for every f, g ∈ B and λ > 0. Then for every f ∈ ¯D(A) and t ≥ 0, one has:

M (t)f = lim
j→∞

j(cid:19)j
H(cid:18) t

f, uniformly for t in compact sets,

where M (t)f is the semigroup generated by A (see the deﬁnition in Theorem 2.1 below).

2 Nonlinear semigroups and curvature ﬂow of graphs

Deﬁnition 1. Let B be a Banach space, and A a B−valued nonlinear operator with domain D(A) ⊂
B. We say that −A is m−dissipative if
• R(I + λA) = B for every λ > 0,
• its resolvent Jλ = (I + λA)−1 is a single-valued contraction.

For non dissipative operators A it is possible to apply the fundamental generation theorem of
Crandall and Liggett [13, Theorem I, p.266] which gives a weak deﬁnition of solution to evolution
equations in the setting of a nonlinear semigroup:

Theorem 2.1. If A is non dissipative operator on a Banach space B, then for all f ∈ B the limit

M (t)(f ) :=

lim

j→∞,λj→t

(I + λA)−j f,

exists locally uniformly in t. This limit is called nonlinear semigroup solution generated by A.

From now on B will denote the space of periodic α-H¨older continuous functions and (B,|| · ||)
will be the Banach space obtained by endowing B with the sup norm || · ||. Then Schauder theory
[32, 33] and Sobolev embedding theorems [34, 35] guarantee for a choice of f ∈ Lp the existence and
uniqueness of W 2,p solutions to (1) as long as < r, en >6= 0.
Deﬁnition 2. A continuous function γ : Rn−1 → R is a weak sub-solution (resp. a super-solution)
of

γ(x′) − λ

n−1

Xi,j=1(cid:18)δij −

γxi(x′)γxj (x′)

in R if for every x′ ∈ Rn−1 and smooth φ : Rn−1 → R such that γ − φ has a maximum (resp. a
minimum) at x′ one must have

γ(x′) − λ

n−1

Xi,j=1(cid:18)δij −

φxi (x′)φxj (x′)

1 + |∇φ(x′)| (cid:19)φxixj (x′) ≤ (resp. ≥) f (x′).

Solutions are functions which are simultaneously super-solutions and sub-solutions.

4

Deﬁnition 3. We say that γ ∈ B belongs to the domain of A if there exists f ∈ B and λ > 0 such
that γ is a weak solution (in the sense of Theorem 2.1) of

γ − λ

n−1

Xi,j=1

aij(∇γ)γxixj = f, where aij(∇γ) :=(cid:18)δij −

γxi γxj

1 + |∇γ|2(cid:19)

in Rn−1. In this case we will write

(I + λA)γ = f.

(7)

Clearly A is deﬁned in a dense set of B, and as being argued in [16, Theorem 2.3, Theorem
2.5]), it is possible to show that A is non dissipative and that its generated weak semigroup solution
coincides with the viscosity solution to (1) (see [5, 12, 15, 16, 25, 27] for details).

3 Properties of operator H

In this section we formally deﬁne the operator H mentioned in the introduction, and we prove that
it is contractive.

We assume that the initial surface Σ0 is the graph of some smooth function γ, and evolve the
measure u0 =< ν, r > δΣ0 for an interval of time [0, T ]. Then the solution of (1) can be written as

u(s, t) =

1

(4πt)n/2 ZΣt

√4πt e−|x−s|2/4tu0(x)dσt,

(8)

where dσt denotes the surface measure element on Σt.

If f0 ∈ B, we send its graph Σ0 to a new set deﬁned via Σt = (cid:16)s′,(cid:0)H(t)f0(cid:1)(s′)(cid:17) = (s′, γt(s′))

with smooth function γt. In order to prove that H induces a ﬂow on B, we need to show that Σt is
the graph of a periodic, α-H¨older continuous function γt:
Lemma 3.1. Let u be the function deﬁned as in (3) and f0 ∈ B. Then for every s′ ∈ Rn−1 and for
every t > 0 there exists a unique value γt(s′) such that

uxn(s′, γt(s′), t) = 0

and uxnxn(s′, γt(s′), t) < 0.

As a consequence, for any t > 0 there exists a function γt ∈ B such that

Σt = (s′, (H(t)f0)(s′)) = (s′, γt(s′)).

Proof. We want to compute the maximum of u in the vertical direction en via

and show that

uxn(s, t) = 0,

uxnxn(s, t) < 0,

5

where the gradient vanishes. Arguing as in Theorem 4.1 we ﬁnd:

uxnxn (s, t) = −

We conclude that

uxnxn (s, t) = − ZRn−1

1 + |∇γ(0′)|2 e−|z|2/4|U −1| dz′ < 0.

Remark. For every ﬁxed s and t > 0 we have proven that uxn(s′,·, t) vanishes only at the point
γt(s′). Then note that

uxn(s′, q, t) < 0 for q > γt(s′) and uxn(s′, q, t) > 0 for q < γt(s′).

Theorem 3.2. For each t ≥ 0 the ﬂow H(t) : B → B just deﬁned has the following properties
(1) If C is a real constant, then H(t)(γ + C) = H(t)γ + C,
(2) If γ ≤ µ then γt = H(t)γ ≤ H(t)µ = µt,

6

(3) H(t) is a contraction on B, i.e.,

||H(t)γ − H(t)µ|| ≤ ||γ − µ||.

Proof. Assertion (1) follows from the deﬁnition. For assertions (2) and (3), consider the evolution
problem given by

(∂t = ∆u in Rn × (0,∞)

u =< ν, r > δΣ0

at time t = 0.

Let us call uγ and uµ the solutions with initial datum deﬁned by the graphs of γ and µ, respectively.
Hence

uγ(s, t) =

1

(4πt)n/2 ZΣ′

t

(x′ − s′, γ(x′) − sn)e− |x′−s′ ,γ(x′)−sn |2

4t

dx′,

and uµ(s) has a similar expression in terms of µ. Note that the function

(γ − sn)e− |γ−sn |2

t

decreases as a function of γ for t > 0 small. It follows that if γ ≤ µ and γt(s′)is the function deﬁned
in Lemma 3.1, then

0 = uγ(s′, γt(s′)) ≥ uµ(s′, γt(s′)).

This implies that γt = H(t)γ ≤ H(t)µ = µt from which assertion (2) follows. We remark that
comparison principle for intrinsic functions µ and γ becomes valid as a direct consequence of assertion
(2).

Assertion (3) follows from assertions (1) and (2). Let us choose s′ such that

H(t)γ(s′) − H(t)µ(s′) > ||H(t)γ(s′) − H(t)µ(s′)|| − ǫ,

for each ǫ > 0 and call

By assertion (2) we have

H(t)γ(s′) = α, H(t)µ(s′) = β.

and it implies by assertion (1) that there exists a point y such that

H(t)γ(s′) − H(t)(µ − β + α − ǫ)(s′) > 0,

γ(y′) − (µ(y′) − β + α − ǫ) > 0.

(9)

Finally (3.2) results in, by deﬁnitions of α and β, that

||H(t)γ − H(t)µ|| < H(t)γ(s′) − H(t)µ(s′) + ǫ < γ(y′) − µ(y′) + 2ǫ ≤ ||γ − µ|| + 2ǫ,

from which assertion (3) follows.

4 Local properties of the evolution

In this section we prove that under the action of the proposed algorithm, each point of initial surface
Σ0 moves in the normal direction with speed equal to

< r, en >

< νs0 , en >< νs0 , r >

K + O(t1/2).

For all t > 0 denote u(x, t) the solution of the Cauchy problem

(∂tu = ∆u in Rn × (0,∞)

u(., 0) = u0(.) =< ν, r > δΣ0(.)

on Σ0 × {t = 0},

With use of the same notations from the previous section, we denote the unit normal to the

surface with νs0 at s0 ∈ Σ0 and select vs0 such that

Then the following result holds:

Theorem 4.1.

s = s0 + tvs0 νs0 ∈ Σt.

vs0 =

< r, en >

< νs0 , en >< νs0 , r >

K + O(t1/2) as t → 0,

where K is the mean curvature (computed with respect to νs0 ) at s0 ∈ Σ0.
Proof. We may assume s0 = 0 = (0, . . . , 0) ∈ Σ0 ⊂ Rn without losing the generality. Then at ﬁxed
time t > 0 we have

More precisely,

∇ru(s, t) = 0.

0 = < ∇u(s, t), r >=

(4πt)(n−1)/2 ZΣ0

< x − tvs0 νs0 , r > e−|x−tvs0 νs0 |2/4tu0(x)dσt.

Consider Σ0 as the graph (x′, γ(x′)) of smooth function γ : Rn−1 → R and write
0 =ZΣ′

<(cid:0)(x′, γ(x′)) − tvs0 νs0(cid:1), r > e−

Now substitute y′ = t−1/2x′ and note that

u0(cid:16)t1/2y′, γ(t1/2y′)(cid:17) = u0(0) + O(t1/2|y′|),
|∇γ(t1/2y′)|2 = |∇γ(0′)|2 + O(t1/2|y′|).

8

Then we obtain

0 = Zt−1/2Σ′

t

<(cid:0)(t1/2y′, γ(t1/2y′)) − tvs0 νs0(cid:1), r > e−

γ(t1/2y′) =

hence the argument of the exponential in (4) becomes

Since the matrix consisting of

gij = δij + γxi (0′)γxj (0′),

is positive deﬁnite there exists a matrix U such that gij = (U T )ihUhj, where the left and right
sub-indices denote row and column positions, respectively, in corresponding matrices. Then with
the change of variable z = U y we can write (4) as

<(cid:0)(t1/2(U −1z)′, γ(t1/2(U −1z)′)) − tvs0 νs0(cid:1), r > e−|z|2/4|U −1| dz′ + O(e−α/2t)

5 Main result

We provide here the proof of Theorem 1.1, which follows in the same way as in the proof of [9,
Theorem 2] with the only change of the corresponding evolution equation.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We only have to show that (1.2) holds for λ = 1. For this purpose, by
following [16, Theorem 5.1] and [9, Theorem 2], we deﬁne for t > 0 and f ∈ B that

γt :=(cid:0)I + t−1(I − H(t))(cid:1)−1

and Atγ :=

γ − H(t)γ

t > 0 that

Let φ ∈ C∞(Σ′

the maximum is strict, adding a suitable power of the gauge distance if it is needed, as for example

k) + o(1) ≤ f (x′
k).

Letting k → ∞ we establish that γ is a weak sub-solution of (3) with λ = 1. Through the same
reasoning one can prove that γ is also a sup-solution and it completes the proof.
