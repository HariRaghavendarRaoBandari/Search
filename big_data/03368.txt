Repeated observations inhibit the coherent evolution of quantum states through the quantum Zeno
eﬀect. In multi-qubit systems this eﬀect provides new opportunities to control complex quantum
states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that repeatedly projecting joint observables of multiple
spins creates coherent quantum Zeno subspaces and simultaneously suppresses dephasing caused
by the environment. We encode up to two logical qubits in these subspaces and show that the
enhancement of the dephasing time with increasing number of projections follows a scaling law that
is independent of the number of spins involved. These results provide new insights into the interplay
between frequent multi-spin measurements and non-Markovian noise and pave the way for tailoring
the dynamics of multi-qubit systems through repeated projections.

The quantum Zeno eﬀect restricts the evolution of repeatedly observed quantum systems. For a two-dimensional
system the state simply is frozen in one of two eigenstates of the measurement operator [1–9]. In multi-dimensional
systems, however, Zeno subspaces are formed that can contain complex quantum states and dynamics: repeated
observations create a barrier that blocks coherent evolution between subspaces, but leaves coherences and dynamics
within those subspaces intact [10]. Analogous eﬀects can also be realized through coherent control pulses or strong
driving ﬁelds that decouple transitions between the subspaces [11–18] . Pioneering experiments have highlighted that
the resulting non-trivial dynamics can be used to prepare exotic quantum states [19–23]. However, the opportunities
to tailor the dynamics of multi-qubit systems by restricting coherent evolution have remained unexplored.

Here we show that repeated multi-spin projections on individually controlled spins create quantum Zeno subspaces
that can encode multiple logical qubits while suppressing dephasing caused by the environment. We realize these
repeated projections for up to three nuclear spins in diamond using the optical transition of a nearby electron spin.
We then encode up to two logical qubits - including entangled states of logical qubits - and show that increasing
the frequency of the projections supresses the dephasing of quantum states. Finally, we theoretically derive and
experimentally verify a scaling law that shows that the increase in dephasing time is independent of the number of
spins involved.

and |1(cid:105)NV : ms = −1) in diamond (see Supplementary Note 1). The natural evolution of the 13C spins is dominated
by dephasing due to the slowly ﬂuctuating surrounding bath of 13C spins (dephasing times T ∗
2 = 12.4(9), 8.2(7) and
21(1) ms for spin 1, 2, and 3 respectively) [24]. Because the ﬂuctuations are quasi-static, the Hamiltonian in a given

The quantum Zeno eﬀect arises when an observable ˆO is projected (superoperator M ( ˆO)), so that the systems

Repeatedly projecting observable ˆO thus inhibits coherent evolution between the two eigenspaces of ˆO. We choose joint
multi-spin observables of the form ˆO = ˆσ⊗k
x , which anti-commute with all terms in the Hamiltonian H, so that rapid
projections ideally result in the eﬀective Zeno Hamiltonian HZeno = P±HP± = 0 [10]. Applying these projections
therefore suppresses dephasing for each nuclear spin, but leaves quantum states and driven dynamics inside the two
subspaces untouched (Fig. 1a).
To investigate quantum Zeno subspaces we use the following experimental sequence (Fig. 1b). We ﬁrst initialize
the nuclear spins in the desired state and prepare the electron spin in |1(cid:105)NV. Leaving the electron in |1(cid:105)NV creates a

diﬀerent frequency shift for each 13C spin that suppresses resonant ﬂip-ﬂop interactions during idle time [25]. We then
apply a total of N projections that are equally distributed in time. Finally the nuclear spin state is read out using the
electron spin as an ancilla [26–31]. Here we consider the case of an even number of projections N , while the results for
odd N are discussed in Supplementary Fig. 1. The total evolution time τ is deﬁned from the end of the initialization
to the start of the read-out. We subtract the time that control operations are applied to the nuclear spins (averaged
over all spins), as dephasing might be suppressed during driving.

We experimentally realize repeated multi-spin projections on the 13C spins by using the NV electron spin as an
ancilla spin (Fig. 1c). First, we entangle the NV electron spin state with the projections on the eigenspaces of ˆO
((cid:104) ˆO(cid:105) = +1 or −1), so that the combined state is α
an optical excitation that is resonant only if the electron-spin state is |1(cid:105)NV (’reset’) [26], which projects the quantum
state and re-initializes the NV electron spin in |0(cid:105)NV through optical pumping (Fig. 1d). Note that it is not required
to extract or record the outcome of the optical measurement. To mitigate extra dephasing caused by the stochastic
nature of the optical re-initialization (time constant of ∼ 1 µs), we use 13C spins with a NV-13C hyperﬁne coupling
that is small compared to the inverse of the time constant for re-initialization (all couplings are below 2π · 50 kHz)
[33]. In addition, we design the gate sequence so that |0(cid:105)NV is associated with the subspace of the initial nuclear state:
ideally the electron spin is never optically excited and the projection constitutes a null measurement.
√
To illustrate the quantum Zeno eﬀect and to benchmark our system, we ﬁrst consider a single 13C spin and study
the dephasing of the superposition state |X(cid:105) ≡ (|0(cid:105) + |1(cid:105))/
2 for ˆO = ˆσx (Fig. 2a). We initialize the 13C spin in |X(cid:105)
with an initial state ﬁdelity of 0.95(2) and apply up to N = 16 projections. For a ﬁxed total evolution time of 40 ms ,
we observe a signiﬁcant increase of the state ﬁdelity with an increasing number of projections (Fig. 2b). The complete
time traces show that the dephasing time increases as more projections are applied (Fig. 2c); the superposition state
is protected by the quantum Zeno eﬀect. In this example, however, the Zeno subspaces contain just a single state and
therefore cannot encode general quantum states.

√
We characterize the storage of quantum states by preparing all six logical basis states |0(cid:105)L,|1(cid:105)L,(|0(cid:105)L±|1(cid:105)L)/

We next investigate Zeno subspaces that can contain an arbitrary two-dimensional quantum state, i.e. a complete
logical quantum bit, by performing joint projections on two 13C spins. We set the joint observable ˆO = ˆσx ˆσx, so
that the four-dimensional state space is divided into two coherent two-level subspaces (Fig. 3a). In these subspaces a
logical qubit that can hold an arbitrary quantum state can be deﬁned as |ψ(cid:105)L = α|0(cid:105)L + β |1(cid:105)L, with |1(cid:105)L = |X, X(cid:105)
and |1(cid:105)L = |−X,−X(cid:105), and with logical operators ˆZL = ˆσx ˆI and ˆXL = ˆσz ˆσz. Note that logical-qubit superposition
states are generally entangled states of the two 13C spins.

2 and averaging the ﬁnal logical state ﬁdelities (Fig. 3b). The logical qubit without projections shows the
same decay as a single 13C spin, but with a slightly reduced initial ﬁdelity (F = 0.89(1)) due to the overhead of creating
the entangled states |ψ(cid:105)L. Applying projections of the joint-observable ˆσx ˆσx strongly suppresses the dephasing by the
environment, while preserving the logical qubit states. As a result, the average state ﬁdelity for the logical qubit
surpasses the best 13C nuclear spin used, while still remaining above the threshold of 2/3 for the storage of quantum
states [34]. This result demonstrates the suppression of the dephasing of a complete logical qubit through the quantum
Zeno eﬀect.

Interestingly, preserving the logical qubit does not actually require the coherence of the second spin to be maintained,
as follows from the logical operator ˆZL = ˆσx ˆI. To show that the complete two-spin state is preserved, including
entanglement between the two nuclear spins, we measure the average state ﬁdelity with the ideal two-spin state for
the four entangled initial states as a function of time (Fig. 3c). The duration for which genuine entanglement persists
(two-spin state ﬁdelity > 0.5) is extended for N = 2, 4 and 6 projections compared to the case without any projections,
indicating that the barrier introduced by the projections inhibits dephasing for any two-spin state within the Zeno
subspace.

Realizing Zeno subspaces with even more dimensions enables the exploration of complex states of multiple logical
qubits within the subspaces. We include a third nuclear spin and set ˆO = ˆσx ˆσx ˆσx to create a protected four-dimensional
subspace, which can host two logical qubits deﬁned by the logical operators ˆZL1 = ˆσx ˆI ˆσx, ˆXL1 = ˆI ˆσz ˆσz and ˆZL2 =
ˆI ˆσx ˆσx, ˆXL2 = ˆσz ˆI ˆσz (Fig. 4a). Each pure state within the (cid:104) ˆO(cid:105) = +1 subspace can be expressed in terms of the logical
two-qubit states:

α|X, X, X(cid:105) + β |−X, X,−X(cid:105) + γ |X,−X,−X(cid:105) + δ |−X,−X, X(cid:105) = α|0, 0(cid:105)L + β |0, 1(cid:105)L + γ |1, 0(cid:105)L + δ |1, 1(cid:105)L .

the entangled logical state |Φ+(cid:105)L = (|0, 0(cid:105)L + |1, 1(cid:105)L)/
of the three-spin operator ˆσx ˆσx ˆσx since they are not eigenstates of a single two-spin operator.

√

The logical state ﬁdelities for all three states show a clear prolongation of the decay times for N = 2 and N = 4
three-spin projections (Fig. 4b). Moreover, for a range of evolution times, the absolute logical state ﬁdelities are
increased despite the initial loss of ﬁdelity due to the complexity of the experimental sequence (33 two-qubit gates for
N = 4, which in total require 1276 refocusing pulses on the electron spin). These results conﬁrm that the introduced
three-spin projections inhibit dephasing of the individual spins while preserving the two logical qubits in a quantum
Zeno subspace.

To gain a detailed quantitative understanding of the quantum-Zeno eﬀect for multi-spin projections, we derive a
complete analytical description for the evolution. We model the projections as instantaneous and the noise as a quasi-
static Gaussian (i.e. non-Markovian) frequency detuning, independent for each nuclear spin. We ﬁnd an analytic
solution for the decay of the expectation value of observables that are sensitive to dephasing (for N projections and
total evolution time τ ):

extracted values from all experiments with 1, 2 and 3 nuclear spins in Fig. 5. The results reveal a scaling law that is
independent of the number of spins involved, in good quantitative agreement with our theoretical model.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that repeatedly projecting joint-observables of multi-spin systems creates
quantum Zeno subspaces that can hold complex quantum states, and that these Zeno subspaces are resilient to
environmental dephasing. Our results give direct insight in the physics of repeated multi-spin measurements under
non-Markovian noise environments. They are also of practical relevance in the context of quantum error correction and
detection codes, in which errors are detected through repeated measurements of joint observables [24, 35]. Moreover, the
demonstrated methods pave the way for investigating the eﬀect of repeated measurements in various noise environments
and for exploring and engineering complex dynamics of multi-spin systems under tailored decoherence [36].

FIG. 1. Concept and experimental sequence. (a) Quantum Zeno subspaces. The state space of a quantum system is
divided into two subspaces (yellow boxes) of an observable ˆO. Coherent transitions between the two subspaces occur while the
system is unperturbed (top, red arrows) but are strongly inhibited if ˆO is repeatedly projected (bottom). (b) Experimental
sequence. After initialization in |ψ(cid:105), N equidistantly distributed projections M ( ˆO) (see Eq. (1)) are applied during a total
evolution time τ and the state of the system is read out. (c) Realization of M ( ˆO = ˆσx ˆσx ˆσx) for three nuclear spins. First the
state of the nuclear spins (yellow) is entangled with the ancilla electron-spin state (purple). Second the electron spin is projected
and reinitialized in |1(cid:105)NV (see also panel d) through optical pumping (30 µs) to |0(cid:105)NV and a subsequent microwave π-pulse (X).
The x and y gates are π/2 rotations around the X- and Y-axis respectively. Controlled gates indicate that the direction is
determined by the electron spin [27]. See Supplementary Fig. 2 for pulse sequences for projections on one and two spins. (d)

so that the optical projection ideally never excites the NV center.

two-spin state ﬁdelity, averaged over the four entangled input states, indicates that general two-spin states in the subspace are
preserved. Above the dashed horizontal line (F = 0.5) the state is entangled. For N = 2, 4 and 6 projections, entanglement
is preserved longer than without projections. Solid lines are ﬁts to Eq. (3) with the initial amplitude A, the oﬀset and the

preserve the two logical qubits while inhibiting dephasing. Solid lines are ﬁts to Eq. (3). The ﬁdelities decay to diﬀerent

FIG. 5. Scaling of the decay time with increasing number of projections. The ﬁtted decay times for all measurements
in this article (Figs. 2-4) are compared to the theoretical decay time enhancement (solid line). All values are taken relative to
the value without projections (N = 0). The data are averaged according to the number of operators in the expectation values
that are subject to dephasing (i.e. the number of ˆσx and/or ˆσy). Red: One operator. Blue: Two operators. Orange: Three
operators (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for raw data). To show that the normalized decay time is independent of the number
of nuclear spins, we distinguish data with a diﬀering total number of nuclear spins. For instance, measurements of (cid:104)ˆσx(cid:105)(with
ˆO = ˆσx) or (cid:104)ˆσx ˆI(cid:105) (with ˆO = ˆσx ˆσx) are represented by separate data points. The theory curve is obtained by evaluating Eq. (3)
up to N = 16 (see Supplementary Fig. 5). Error bars are 1 s.d.

Analysis for an odd number of projections.

(a) Experimental results for the logical qubit in the two-spin case
FIG. S1.
(Fig. 3b of the main text). We observe a clear elevation of the average state ﬁdelity for times much longer than T ∗
2 for 1
(blue) and 3 (orange) projections. This was also observed in J. Cramer et al.
for N = 1 [24]. The behavior for times much
longer than the decoherence time is fully explained by our model and can be accurately ﬁt with Supplementary Eq. (S5). (b)
Schematic explanation of the elevated signal for large evolution times τ (cid:29) T ∗
2 . Top panel: A spin-1/2 particle is initialized in
a superposition state |X(cid:105), evolves freely for a time τ /2 until it is projected (M (ˆσx)) onto |±X(cid:105) and is ﬁnally read out after a
total evolution time of τ . Bottom panel: Sketch of an ensemble of states in the XY plane of the Bloch sphere. The state of the
particle is well deﬁned after initialization 1(cid:13). The state is however completely mixed due to a random frequency detuning before
projection 2(cid:13) if the free evolution τ /2 is much longer than the dephasing time T ∗
2 . Projection into |±X(cid:105) eﬀectively projects
the Bloch vector onto the x-axis 3(cid:13). The frequency detuning of the particle remains constant after projection such that the
√
ensemble average partly rephases (similarly to a spin echo) after another evolution time of τ /2. We call this eﬀect a ﬁlter since a
single projection of ˆσx completely mixes the state if the particle is in |±Y (cid:105) = (|X(cid:105)± i|−X(cid:105))/
2, eﬀectively ﬁltering those cases
out. In contrast states which are aﬀected by a detuning but got rotated to |±X(cid:105) at the time of the projection are unaﬀected.

FIG. S3. Electron spin resonance to determine the initialization ﬁdelity of the 14N nuclear spin (I = 1) in mI = −1. Inset:
Schematic of the experimental sequence. After measurement-based initialization of the nucleus (MBI) a weak microwave pulse
(MW) [37] with a duration of 8 µs is applied and followed by optical read out (RO) of the electron spin. The detuning is relative
to the central microwave frequency (1.74667(1) GHz) of the ms = 0 to ms = −1 transition of the electron spin. The transition
is split into six lines due to strong hyperﬁne coupling to the 14N nuclear spin (with a coupling strength of 2π · 2.195(1) MHz)
and a 13C nuclear spin (I = 1/2, with a coupling strength of 2π · 182(1) kHz) in the vicinity of the NV centre. The data is
therefore ﬁt to six Lorentzian functions with variable width, spacing and amplitude. From the ﬁtted amplitudes we extract the
population of the 14N nuclear spin after MBI: p−1 = 0.96(1) p0 = 0.022(8) p+1 = 0.014(8).

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 1: DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS

The experiments were conducted in a confocal microscope at cryogenic temperatures (4 K). The investigated sample
is a chemical-vapour-deposition homoepitaxially grown diamond of type IIa with a natural composition of carbon
isotopes. The diamond has been cut along the < 111 > crystal axis and was grown by Element Six.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 2: ANALYTICAL MODEL AND DATA PROCESSING

1. Derivation of the analytical model

This section outlines the derivation of Eq. (3) of the main text. We consider k two-level systems with random,
uncorrelated and constant detuning ∆i for each two-level system. Without loss of generality, the initial (t = 0) state
is chosen to be the balanced superposition state |X1 ··· Xk(cid:105). This state is an eigenstate of the projected operator
ˆσx,1 ··· ˆσx,k. After the ﬁrst projection at time t and evolution of the system for another time t an analytic expression
for the expectation value (cid:104)ˆσx,1 ··· ˆσx,k(cid:105)N =1 = Tr [ρˆσx,1 ··· ˆσx,k], with the density matrix ρ, can be derived.

This sum of cosine terms originates from static terms in the relevant entries of the density matrix after projection.
The formula for a single projection (N = 1) is then readily extended to N projections

After inserting this rewritten cosine term into Supplementary Eq. (S3) we obtain a product of Fourier transformations
for each summand in Supplementary Eq. (S4). It becomes clear that the precise assignment of the αi coeﬃcients does
not play a role for the evaluation of the integral since the Fourier transformation and inverse Fourier transformation of
a Gaussian give the same result: i.e. the precise assignment of αi = ±1 does not play a role for the evaluated integral.
2k−1 therefore drops out when summing over all possible conﬁgurations of αi. Evaluating

2. Fitting routine

The ﬁts to the data are performed in the following way. First, the decay without projections (N = 0) is ﬁt with
a Gaussian function. The initial amplitude, oﬀset and width are extracted. Second, in order to ﬁt data sets with
multiple projections Supplementary Eq. (S5) is multiplied with the extracted amplitude and the oﬀset is added (the
oﬀset originates from constant (cid:104)ˆσz,1 ··· ˆσz,k(cid:105) correlations that are not subject to dephasing and play a role when
determining average state ﬁdelities). The data set is then ﬁtted with three free parameters: T ∗
2,eﬀ , a global amplitude
damping that parametrizes errors due to the added complexity of the experiment and the aforementioned constant
oﬀset.

3. Scaling law

In order to obtain the theory curve in Fig. 5 of the main text, we compute the theoretical enhancement of the
dephasing time for a given number of projections. We calculate the normalized 1√
e -time of Supplementary Eq. (S5)
for N being even and smaller than 17. A modiﬁed scaling law, 1 + µN ν, is ﬁt to the extracted characteristic dephasing
times and the parameters µ = 0.77(1) and ν = 0.63(1) (see Supplementary Fig. S5) are found.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE 3: 13C SPIN READ-OUT CORRECTION

We correct the read-out results for errors introduced by the ﬁnal conditional gates on the 13C spins to obtain
the actual state ﬁdelity. We employ a characterization technique developed in reference [24] and determine correction
factors (CCi) for one-, two- and three-spin expectation values. The applied correction assumes a symmetric initialization
and read-out process as well as a constant loss of ﬁdelity due to imperfect initialization of the 14N spin of the NV
centre. The probability to ﬁnd the 14N spin in mI = −1 after initialization is found to be 0.96(1) (see Supplementary

Fig. S3). We obtain the following correction factors

CC1 = 0.94(1)
CC1C2C3 = 0.90(2)

CC2 = 0.94(1)
CC1C3 = 0.93(2)

CC1C2 = 0.93(2)
CC2C3 = 0.95(2)
