Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of λφ4 Theory in 2 Space-Time Dimensions

Neil Christensen

Illinois State University

We propose a new non-perturbative technique for calculating the ﬁeld-theory S matrix directly
from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Our method involves a discretized momentum space and
a momentum cutoﬀ, thereby truncating the Hilbert space and making numerical diagonalization of
the Hamiltonian achievable. We show how to do this in the context of a simpliﬁed λφ4 theory in
two space-time dimensions. We present the results of our diagonalization, its dependence on time,
its dependence on the parameters of the theory and its renormalization.

Quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) allows us to write a man-
ifestly local, Lorentz-invariant formulation of the funda-
mental physics governing relativistic quantum particles
[1]. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, a
QFT, agrees with all experiments to date, including the
high energy particle collisions at the Large Hadron Col-
lider (LHC). Its structure is suﬃciently constraining that
it forced theorists to predict the existence of the Higgs
boson [2–7] ﬁve decades before its spectacular discovery
in 2012 [8, 9]. It is also suﬃciently ﬂexible to allow us
to construct models for physics beyond the SM, includ-
ing neutrino masses, supersymmetry, and dark matter to
name a few.

However, it has become increasingly clear that its per-
turbation theory, traditionally encapsulated in Feynman
diagrams, is extremely and unnecessarily ineﬃcient. In
particular, the number of Feynman diagrams grows ex-
ponentially with the number of ﬁnal state particles and
with the number of loops. For example, in a pure the-
ory of gluons, it takes the following numbers of Feynman
diagrams to calculate scattering rates at tree level: 4;
25; 220; 2,485; 34,300; 559,405; and 10,525,900 Feynman
diagrams for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 external particles, re-
spectively [10]. And, if we go to one loop, the scattering
of just seven gluons involves 227,585 Feynman diagrams
[10]. In the regimes of ultra-high numbers of Feynman di-
agrams, the individual diagrams lose their meaning and
the calculation becomes challenging or impossible even
for computers.

On the other hand, new methods to calculate the scat-
tering amplitude that bypass Feynman diagrams alto-
gether, and indeed sometimes QFT itself, are being dis-
covered. One highlight of this work is the discovery
by Parke and Taylor [11] that the maximally-helicity-
violating tree-level amplitude could be written as an ex-
pression with only one term no matter how many thou-
sands of Feynman diagrams were involved. Another im-
portant highlight is the discovery by Britto, Cachazo,
Feng and Witten [12] that any tree-level helicity ampli-
tude of gluons could be calculated using a simple recur-
sion relation based on the asymptotic behavior of the
complexiﬁed gluon momenta. Since then, much exciting
progress has been made and, indeed, continues [13–15].
There are even some indications that scattering ampli-
tudes, although seemingly ordinary, may be leading us
to a much deeper understanding of the combination of

special relativity and quantum mechanics [16, 17].

Notwithstanding the enormous progress made by the
unitarity-based methods, it seems clear that new tech-
niques for calculating scattering amplitudes that go be-
yond Feynman diagrams would be welcome. In particu-
lar, an approach whose approximation scheme was non-
perturbative would complement well the existing eﬀorts.
In this paper, we begin an exploration of another po-
tential method for calculating the S-matrix and thereby
the scattering amplitudes. We propose to diagonalize the
Hamiltonian directly and use the eigenstates to calculate
the scattering amplitude. Of course, the Hamiltonian is
inﬁnite dimensional and so this is normally impossible.
However, very brieﬂy, what we suggest is to discretize
the Hamiltonian by discretizing momentum space (e.g.
by reducing the volume of spacetime to a ﬁnite size with
boundary conditions) and cutting the momentum oﬀ at
an upper limit far above the scale of the calculation. The
resulting discrete Hamiltonian will be ﬁnite and diago-
nalizable using standard computational techniques. At
best, this will, of course, be an approximation to the
diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian. However, it is
a non-perturbative approximation and therefore, we be-
lieve, potentially complements standard methods.

In slightly greater detail, our plan is to: a) Legendre
transform the Lagrangian to obtain the Hamiltonian; b)
Use direct products of free-particle states as a complete
orthonormal basis; c) Insert the deﬁnitions of the ﬁelds in
terms of the creation and annihilation operators of free-
particle states; d) Discretize momentum space and there-
fore the Hilbert space; e) Truncate the basis states by
cutting oﬀ the energy of the states and thereby make the
Hilbert space ﬁnite; f) Calculate the numerical Hamilto-
nian matrix elements in the resulting ﬁnite Hilbert space;
g) Numerically diagonalize the resulting Hamiltonian ma-
trix; and h) Use the resulting eigenstates to calculate the
S matrix. These steps will be further explained in the
context of a simpliﬁed λφ4 theory in Sec. I and the re-
sults will be presented in the following sections.

Before getting into the details, we should note that
there is a Ph.D. thesis from 1969 by A. Suri [18], where
Wilson states [19] that he and his student diagonalized
the Hamiltonian in a latticized space-time and calculated
the scattering amplitudes. Their work was seminal in the
foundation of lattice gauge theory [20]. Although the di-
agonalization of the Hamiltonian is a common goal, our

method uses diﬀerent techniques. We do not latticize
space-time.
Instead, we use of a complete set of free-
particle product states and the insertion of creation and
annihilation operators as a means to calculate the Hamil-
tonian that is then diagonalized. Furthermore, we take
advantage of the many orders-of-magnitude improvement
in the speed and memory of modern computers since that
thesis. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is
unique.

We organize this paper as follows. In Sec. I, we describe
in detail our Hamiltonian, its discretization and trunca-
tion. In Sec. II, we describe the results of our numerical
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian with an illustrative
set of parameters. In Sec. III, we show how our results
depend on the parameters of the theory. In Sec. IV, we
discuss the renormalization of the parameters and its ef-
fect on the eigenstates and their energies. In Sec. V, we
discuss our results and conclude.

the multiplicities for those momenta. As previously de-
scribed, because our theory has a parity symmetry, even
and odd numbers of free particles will decouple. For com-
putational eﬃciency, therefore, we diagonalize the Hamil-
tonian separately for basis state with even and odd num-
bers of particles. However, we will consider both even
and odd numbers of free particles together in the present
discussion for convenience. The free energies for our ba-

that it adds a free-particle to the direct product of free-

For the present paper, we begin to develop our tech-
niques in the simplest possible context. We begin with
a pure scalar ﬁeld theory in 2 dimensions (1 spatial di-
mension) with a quartic coupling and a parity symmetry.
Our Lagrangian is

Because of the parity symmetry, even and odd numbers
of asymptotically-free particles decouple and we focus on
basis states with an even number of free particles in the
present work. The action resulting from our Lagrangian
is

S =

d2xL .

(2)

(cid:90)

Since the action is dimensionless, dx has dimension 1/E
and ∂µ has dimension E, we ﬁnd that φ is dimensionless.
This implies that λ has dimension E2.

Before continuing the technical details, we note that
[21–23] studied various theoretical properties of this 2-
dimensional theory. We also note that the numerical di-
agonalization of scalar φ4 theory has been carried out in
[24, 25]. However, our work is novel in several respects.
Among them are that [24, 25] focused solely on the prop-
erties of the vacuum whereas we consider it as just one
(important) state among the many other eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian. Also, our Hamiltonian is Lorentz co-
variant, our approach to renormalization is diﬀerent, and
[24, 25] were not interested in the S-matrix.

In order to diagonalize the Hamiltonian, we need a
complete basis set for which we can calculate the Hamil-
tonian. We use direct products of free particles for our
basis. We label them as |(cid:105),|(p, n)(cid:105),|(p1, n1), (p2, n2)(cid:105), ...
where p, p1 and p2 are the momenta and n, n1 and n2 are

Consequently, these operators satisfy the commutation
property

(cid:2)a(p), a†(p(cid:48))(cid:3) = 2πδ(p − p(cid:48)) .

(5)

With these operators, a ﬁeld theory can be constructed
in the usual way (see Weinberg [1]) by writing the scalar
ﬁeld as a linear combination of these two operators

we switch to discrete momentum space. We take

where we have dropped an overall constant term that
does not aﬀect the dynamics. We can see that the ef-
fectively free part of this Hamiltonian (the part that is
quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators) not
only contains the free-particle energy ω but also the sec-
ond term proportional to λ. This comes from the normal
ordering removing creation and annihilation operators
from the original Hamiltonian. Eq. (10) is the Hamil-
tonian that we will diagonalize in this work.

Since our Hamiltonian conserves momentum (as it
must), we need only consider states with total momen-
tum equal to zero. The Hamiltonian matrix elements
for any other center of momentum can be obtained from
these by an appropriate Lorentz transformation.

In order to diagonalize this Hamiltonian, we ﬁnd its
matrix elements in the free-particle product basis by
sandwiching this operator between the basis states. For
example, the free-vacuum matrix element is given by

(cid:104)|H|(cid:105) = 0 ,

(11)

since every operator of the Hamiltonian annihilates ei-
ther the free vacuum on the right or the left. Other
elements are, of course, non zero. As we mentioned, the
basis states with an odd number of free particles decou-
ple. We can now see that this is because every term of the
Hamiltonian contains an even number of creation and an-
nihilation operators. Since we only consider basis states
with zero total momentum, there is only one basis state
with one free particle to consider. It is |(0GeV, 1)(cid:105) and
the only nonzero Hamiltonian matrix element involving
it is the diagonal term

II. THE RESULTS

We implemented the Hamiltonian described in Eq. (10)
and diagonalized it using the numerical techniques de-
scribed in App. B. For this section, we chose our illustra-
tive constants to be

∆p = 0.05GeV,

λ = 0.1GeV2

and m = 1GeV ,

(19)
and cut oﬀ our single particle momenta at ±10GeV. By
design, we took ∆p to be small compared to m and λ
while the cutoﬀ momentum was taken to be large com-
pared to the same. We also took λ to be small compared

particle energies used in this analysis. The ﬁrst number in
parentheses is the momentum of a free-particle state while the
second number is the multiplicity of that momentum. These
states are formed as a direct product of free-particle states.

consequences, in the present work, we have restricted
our basis states to only include two or fewer free parti-
cles. This will allow us to develop our results in as simple
a system as possible and enable us to draw conclusions
about the results more easily. However, our intention
in future works is to go beyond this limitation and con-
sider more complex systems with more complete Hilbert
spaces. Therefore, in this work, our basis states consist of
the free vacuum |(cid:105), the one-free-particle state |(0GeV, 1)(cid:105),
and two-free-particle states with each particle’s momen-
tum below ±10GeV as described above. There are 203
of these basis states ordered in terms of their free energy.
We give a list of the basis states used in our numerical
code in Table I.

space.

A. Energy Spectrum

After diagonalizing, the eigenstates have deﬁnite en-
ergy corresponding with the eigenvalues. We show a plot
of the energies obtained in the top plot of Fig. 1. We
have plotted the eigenvalues in red while in black we
have plotted the free-particle energies of the basis states
for comparison. Along the horizontal axis, we have used
the free-particle basis-state energies for reference. Be-
cause of this, the free-particle basis-state energies in black

(red dots) which were obtained by numerical diagonalization
of the discretized form of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) with
the parameters given in Eq. (19). The black dots are the
free energies of the basis states. The bottom plot displays
the diﬀerence between the energy eigenvalues and the free
energies of the basis states.

form a diagonal line with a slope of 1 and a gap between
the free vacuum, the free 1-particle state and the free
2-particle states. For the coordinates of each eigenstate,
on the other hand, we have given it an abscissa equal
to the energy of the free-particle basis state that domi-
nates its eigenstate (see the next subsections), while the
ordinate is the energy eigenvalue. We have found that
with the parameters listed in Eq. (19), the lowest en-
ergy eigenvalue (associated with the vacuum) has a value
of -0.0517GeV, the single-particle state (associated with
|(0GeV, 1)(cid:105)) has an energy of 1.075GeV, and the lowest-
energy two-particle eigenstate (associated most closely
with |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105)) has an energy of 2.151GeV, double that
of the single-particle state. This is because the lowest-
energy two-particle state is dominated by two free par-
ticles at rest and the diagonal entry for two particles at
rest in Eq. (16) is essentially double that of the diagonal
entry of a single particle at rest in Eq. (12). The energies
of the other two-particle states grow nearly linearly from
there.

We note that the eigenvalue energies lie very close to

they are not exactly equal. To further clarify the re-
lationship with the free energies of the basis states, we
have plotted the diﬀerence between the eigenvalues and
the basis-state energies in the bottom plot of Fig. 1. We
see that the vacuum is slightly below the free energy of
the free vacuum |(cid:105) as mentioned previously. The fact
that its energy is very close to −∆p is a coincidence as
we will see in Sec. III A. The single-particle state en-
ergy is slightly above the free energy of a single particle,
the lowest two-particle eigenstate doubles the diﬀerence
with the free energy of |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105), and the higher energy
two-particle states have energies that asymptotically ap-
proach the free energies of their associated basis states.
The reason the energies are greater than the free ener-
gies of the associated basis states is due to the interac-
tions and the nonperturbative nature of our calculation
as can be seen in Eq. (12) for the single-particle state.
In Eq. (16), on the other hand, we see that the ﬁrst two
terms are exactly double those in Eq. (12), leading to the
very-nearly double eigenvalue.

We also note that there is a gap between the vacuum
and the one-particle eigenstate and then another between
the one-particle state and the continuum of two-particle
states. As expected, this is due to the mass of the par-
ticle.
In fact, the mass gap is the diﬀerence between
the single-particle state energy and that of the vacuum.
Therefore, we take the physical value of the mass in this
calculation to be 1.075GeV+0.052GeV=1.127GeV. And,
similarly for the other eigenstates. The physical energy
is the diﬀerence between the energy eigenvalue and the
vacuum energy. So, the physical energy of the ﬁrst two-
particle state is 2.151GeV+0.052GeV=2.203GeV, a little
less than double the physical energy of the single-particle
state. This may be a sign of binding energy. Further in-
vestigation is required.

Additionally, we have diagonalized the Hamiltonian for
hundreds of unique nonzero times and ﬁnd that the eigen-
values exactly agree for all time. We ﬁnd, therefore, that
the energy eigenvalues are independent of time, as we
would expect from energy conservation.

B. Absolute Wave Functions

Since the coeﬃcients of the basis states are, in gen-
eral, complex, we begin by describing the modulus of the
coeﬃcients. We present the absolute values of the co-
eﬃcients of the wave function for a few eigenstates in
Fig. 2. We found that the moduli of the wavefunctions
are independent of time. This can be seen in Fig. 2 where
the wavefunction for two diﬀerent times were plotted and
are exactly on top of each other. In fact, we numerically
diagonalized the Hamiltonian for a few hundred diﬀer-
ent times and found exact agreement of the modulus of
the coeﬃcients for all time. This is expected since the
Hamiltonian is the generator of time evolution. Since
these solutions are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, we
expect that, at most, their phases change as a function

FIG. 2: A plot of the absolute values of the coeﬃcients of
the wavefunction for a few eigenstates. The horizontal axis
gives the basis-state free-particle energies as speciﬁed in the
right column of Table I. These wavefunctions were obtained
by a numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (10)
with the parameters given in Eq. (19). The solid black line
is for t = 0 while the dashed red line (directly on top of the
solid black line) is for t = 1GeV−1. The top plot is for the
vacuum state, the middle plot is for the ﬁrst excited two-
particle state and the bottom plot is for the ﬁftieth excited
two-particle state.

of time. We will discuss the phases in Subsection II C.

There are several general features of these wavefunc-
tions. We see that there is no contribution from the free
single-particle basis state |(0GeV, 1)(cid:105). This is because
the basis states with odd numbers of free particles decou-

also see that there is a gap between the contribution of
the free vacuum and the free two-particle states. This is
because we have plotted these eigenstates as functions of
the free-particle energies of the basis states and there is a
gap in the free-particle energies between the zero-particle
and two-particle basis states. However, even if we plotted
the eigenstate as a function of the ordinal number of the
basis state given in the left column of Table I (but leaving
out the single-particle state), there would be no gap and
the line would be continuous, but there would be a kink
in the wavefunction at the free-particle vacuum. This is
because the free vacuum is fundamentally diﬀerent than
the continuum of two-particle basis states. So, in gen-
eral, we do not expect its contribution to any particle
eigenstate to be inﬁnitesimally close to the two-particle
basis states adjacent to it.
In general, we also ﬁnd that there is a kink between
the contribution from the basis-state |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105) and
|(−0.05GeV, 1), (0.05GeV, 1)(cid:105), which are the ﬁrst two ba-
sis states in the continuum. Presumably, this is because
the basis state |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105) is a direct product of two
particles at rest, whereas the other two-particle basis
states have particles with equal but opposite non-zero
momenta.

We also see that, for each eigenstate, there is one ba-
sis state that dominates the wavefunction while all other
basis states contribute at approximately the percent or
less level. This can be understood in terms of the cou-
pling. If we turned the coupling oﬀ completely, the the-
ory would be absolutely free and the eigenstates would
be delta functions centered at each of the free-particle
basis states. When we turn the coupling on to a very
small value, the states adjacent to this basis state sud-
denly turn on their contribution, continuously with the
coupling. Because of this, the contribution of the adja-
cent basis states is small in proportion to the smallness
of the coupling constant. We, furthermore, see that this
creates a kink in the eigenstate at the basis states directly
to the sides of the former delta function. This is because
as we turn the coupling on from zero, the contribution
from these states immediately turns on, but continuously
in the continuum of states to the sides of the former delta
function. That is, they all come up together, forming a
kink. This kink tends to be mild, however.

The top plot of Fig. 2 gives the wavefunction of the
vacuum, the eigenstate of lowest energy. As expected,
we can see that it is strongly peaked at the free vac-
uum |(cid:105). Its coeﬃcient is 0.991. The next most impor-
tant contribution to the vacuum is from the basis state
|(−0.05GeV, 1), (0.05GeV, 1)(cid:105), containing two free parti-
cles, each with ±0.05GeV of momentum. Its contribution
to the vacuum is a few percent. Beyond this, the con-
tribution falls oﬀ towards zero. We note that although
the fall oﬀ appears to be gradual, this is on a log plot.
By the time the two-hundred-third basis state is reached,
the contribution to the wavefunction has fallen to a few
hundredths of a percent.

6

The middle plot of Fig. 2 gives the wavefunction of
the ﬁrst two-particle state, the state whose energy is di-
rectly above that of the vacuum and single-particle state,
and which has slightly more energy than the free-particle
energy of its dominant basis state. We can see that it
is strongly peaked at the lowest free-particle basis state
with two particles, namely |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105), where each free
particle is at rest. Its coeﬃcient is 0.937. The next most
important contribution to this eigenstate is from the ba-
sis state |(−0.05GeV, 1), (0.05GeV, 1)(cid:105) which contributes
at the few percent level. Beyond this, the contribution
to this eigenstate falls oﬀ towards zero.

The bottom plot of Fig. 2 gives the wavefunction of
the ﬁftieth two-particle state, the state with the ﬁftieth
energy level above that of the vacuum and single-particle
state. We see that it is strongly peaked at the ﬁfti-
eth free-particle product state with two particles, namely
|(−2.45GeV, 1), (2.45GeV, 1)(cid:105), whose free-particle energy
is 5.3GeV. Its coeﬃcient is 0.99996. All other basis states
contribute at the less than one percent level. The high-
est of these is the free vacuum at the half percent level.
This drops to a hundredth of a percent for |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105),
followed by a small discrete jump and then a gradual in-
crease towards the peak reaching a pre-peak maximum
of a few tenths of a percent. At this point, and on the
other side of the peak, is a mild kink due to the nonzero
coupling bringing up the contribution of the adjacent
states together. As in the previous two cases, we see that
the contribution to this eigenstate continues to fall oﬀ at
higher basis states, eventually tending towards zero.

We also note that due to the decoupling nature of the
basis states with an odd number of free particles and
the fact that we only included basis states with two or
fewer free particles, the single particle state |(0GeV, 1)(cid:105)
is the only basis state to be diagonal in its block of the
Hamiltonian. Therefore, it is already diagonalized and
its wavefunction is a delta function at this basis state.

C. Wave Function Phases

Now that we have an understanding of the absolute val-
ues of the coeﬃcients of the wavefunctions, we turn our
attention to the phases of these same coeﬃcients. Since
the overall phase of any eigenstate is arbitrary, we have
normalized it by taking the phase of the coeﬃcient of the
free-vacuum basis state |(cid:105) to be 0. So, all other phases
are relative to the coeﬃcient of the free-vacuum. We have
plotted a selection of these phases for three eigenstates in
Fig. 3. For each plot, time is plotted along the horizontal
axis while the phases are along the vertical axis. We have
plotted the phase for just ten or eleven coeﬃcients (out of
the 203 coeﬃcients of the basis states listed in Table I) to
make the plot less busy, but the other coeﬃcients follow
the same pattern, ﬁlling in the gaps with one exception.
The gap between 0 and π on the left of the plot is not
ﬁlled in by the other coeﬃcients.

The organization of the lines is as follows: The bot-

plots, this dashed gold line begins at 0. We ﬁnd that,
as a general rule, the phase of all coeﬃcients for basis
states below and including the dominant basis state of the
eigenstate, begin at 0 while the phases of the coeﬃcients
of the basis states above the dominant basis state begin
at π. Therefore, we ﬁnd that for the vacuum eigenstate,
shown in the top plot of Fig. 3, only the free-vacuum
basis-state phase begins at 0. All other phases begin at
π since the free-vacuum basis state dominates the vac-
uum. On the other hand, in the middle plot of Fig. 3,
both the coeﬃcients of the free vacuum |(cid:105) and the dom-
inant basis state |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105) begin at 0 while all others
begin at π. The dotted red line of the middle plot is the
phase of the basis state |(−0.05GeV, 1), (0.05GeV, 1)(cid:105),
which is the next higher basis state. Finally, the bot-
tom plot, for the ﬁftieth excited eigenstate, has all phases
for basis states below and including the dominant basis
state |(−2.45GeV, 1), (2.45GeV, 1)(cid:105) beginning at 0. The
phases for all basis states above this, on the other hand,
begin at π.

The rest of the lines are as follows: the dotted green
line above the dashed gold line is for the basis state
|(−1.25GeV, 1), (1.25GeV, 1)(cid:105), the dot-dashed red line
above that is for |(−2.5GeV, 1), (2.5GeV, 1)(cid:105), the solid
blue line above that is for |(−3.75GeV, 1), (3.75GeV, 1)(cid:105),
and so on.
Each higher line is for a basis state
with the momenta increased by 1.25GeV, with the ﬁ-
nal dashed green line at the top being for the ba-
sis state |(−10GeV, 1), (10GeV, 1)(cid:105).
In addition to the
lines separated by 1.25GeV, we have added a dot-
ted red curve to the middle and bottom plots. For
the middle plot, this dotted red line is the third line
from the bottom and corresponds with the basis state
|(−0.05GeV, 1), (0.05GeV, 1)(cid:105). Its purpose is to include
the basis state directly above the dominant basis state.
In the bottom plot, the dotted red line is for the domi-
nant basis state |(−2.45GeV, 1), (2.45GeV, 1)(cid:105).

We further ﬁnd that the slopes of each line correspond-
ing to the same basis state are the same for all eigen-
states. That is to say, for example, the gold dashed line
corresponding to the phase of the basis state |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105)
has the same slope in all three plots of Fig. 3, and in-
deed for all other eigenstates. This is true whether the
phase begins at 0 or π. As another example, the phase
of the basis state |(−1.25GeV, 1), (1.25GeV, 1)(cid:105) shown in
dotted green in all three plots of Fig. 3 has a slope of ap-
proximately π in all three plots whether it begins at π as
in the top and middle plot or begins at 0 as it does in the
bottom plot. In fact, we plot the slopes of these phase
rates as red dots in Fig. 4. Along with these phase slopes,
we plot the free energies of the basis states in black. The
black points are exactly covered by the red dots. As a
result, we see that the phases of each of the coeﬃcients
of the basis states change in time with a rate equal to the
free energy of that basis state.

It might be expected that the eigenstates would be
constant in time up to an overall phase that changes
according to the eigenenergy as in exp(−iHt)ψE =

free-vacuum basis state |(cid:105) for each eigenstate. By our nor-
malization convention, it is always 0. Each successively
higher line is for a correspondingly higher basis state. As
a result, we ﬁnd that each successively higher basis state
has a phase that increases with time at a correspondingly
higher constant rate. Directly above the free-vacuum line
at 0, the dashed gold line is the phase of the coeﬃcient of
the basis state |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105). We note that in the top plot,

be transitions of in states of deﬁnite energy to out states
of deﬁnite energy (see, for example, [1]). However, since
our eigenvalues are all unique, we ﬁnd that the S matrix
is just a delta function.

Sαβ = δαβ

(22)

where α and β specify the state. Since there are no de-
generacies, they uniquely determine the energy of the in
and out states, Eα and Eβ. That is to say, the S matrix
is trivial for us. The reason is that we have truncated the
Hilbert space so severely that we have removed the pos-
sibility of non-trivial scattering. In a future work, when
we have included basis states with greater numbers of
free particles, the S matrix will become non trivial and
scattering will be possible.

III. DEPENDENCE ON PARAMETERS

Now that we have a basic understanding of the results
of the numerical diagonalization for one particular set
of parameters, we would like to explore how the results
depend on the parameters. We describe the dependence
on ∆p in Sec. III A, λ in Sec. III B, m in Sec. III C and
the cutoﬀ momentum in Sec. III D.

A. Dependence on ∆p

The physical momentum is continuous and therefore,
the spacing between momenta ∆p is not a physical pa-
rameter. Therefore, the physical values should be inde-
pendent of ∆p and the results of our calculation should
converge to the physical values in the limit that ∆p → 0.
Achieving this will require a renormalization of the phys-
ical parameters λ and m. We will discuss renormaliza-
tion further in Sec. IV. In order to clarify this, we be-
gin by studying the dependence on ∆p by itself. In this
section, we continue to use the same numerical values
for m and λ deﬁned in Eq. (19), but we now vary ∆p.
We numerically diagonalized the Hamiltonian for four
values, namely ∆p =0.05GeV, 0.025GeV, 0.01GeV and
0.005GeV, covering one order of magnitude.

We begin with a discussion of the eigenvalues. We
found that, with the exception of the vacuum, all the
eigenvalues were essentially unaﬀected by the change in
∆p. In fact, we found that the change in the eigenvalues
was on the order of 0.01% or smaller for all the eigen-
states other than the vacuum. This was true both for
the eigenvalues obtained by numerical diagonalization of
the Hamiltonian as well as for the single-particle energy
obtained directly from Eq. (12). Because of this, all the
eigenvalues other than the vacuum can be seen in Fig. 1
for all values of ∆p.

The vacuum, on the other hand, was signiﬁcantly af-
fected by the change in ∆p. We plot the vacuum energies
in Fig. 5 on a log-log scale. We can see that the vacuum

FIG. 4: A plot of the rate of change of the phases of the co-
eﬃcients of each basis state. The horizontal axis is the free
energy of the basis states given in Table I. The eigenstates
giving these phases were obtained by a numerical diagonal-
ization of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) with the parameters
given in Eq. (19). The red dots are the phase rates of change
while the black dots (that are exactly covered) are the free
energies of the basis states.

exp(−iEt)ψE. This would be true if the Hamiltonian
were independent of time. However, our Hamiltonian,
as seen in Eq. (10), is not independent of time. Its de-
pendence on time is determined by Lorentz covariance.
Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that the dependence of the eigen-
states on time is not complicated. There is a universal
unitary operator that advances the eignestates from one
time to another as in ψE(t + ∆t) = U (∆t)ψE(t). It is
given by

U (∆t) =

(20)

where ωi is the free-particle energy of the basis state.
Consequently, we ﬁnd, in this basis, that the Hamiltonian
at time t is related to the Hamiltonian at time t = 0 by

H(t) = U (t)H(0)U−1(t) .

(21)

D. The S Matrix and Scattering

One of our long-term goals is to determine whether the
S matrix and the associated scattering amplitudes can be
calculated from the results of numerical diagonalization
of the Hamiltonian. In the present case with only up to
two free particles in the basis states, we ﬁnd that there
are no degeneracies. Every eigenvalue occurs once and
only once. Therefore, as is well known, the eigenstates
are orthogonal. In particular, the S matrix is deﬁned to

FIG. 5: A plot of the energy of the vacuum as a function
of ∆p. The other parameters are given in Eq. (19). The
eigenvalues were obtained by a numerical diagonalization of
the Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) and are plotted as blue dots.

energy satisﬁes a simple power law scaling with the size
of ∆p given by

Evac(∆p) = − 0.00311GeV1.94

∆p0.94

.

(23)

Although we can not derive this result fully analytically,
we give a brief argument for this power-law dependence
in App. C. From this result, we can see that the vacuum
energy diverges towards negative inﬁnity as ∆p → 0.
This should not surprise us as quantum ﬁeld theory is
well known to have inﬁnities that are required to be ab-
sorbed into other parameters by the process of renormal-
ization. In the present approach to calculating observ-
ables in quantum ﬁeld theory, these inﬁnities come pre-
cisely from ∆p → 0, as well as from the cutoﬀ on energy
discussed in Sec. III D. We will discuss renormalization
further in Sec. IV.

The mass gap is the diﬀerence between the single-
particle state energy and the vacuum energy. Since the
single-particle energy does not change, we see that the
physical mass increases as ∆p decreases.
It also be-
comes inﬁnite and renormalization must be performed
to achieve the physically measured value. Such an ad-
justment will not only aﬀect the single-particle mass but
all the other energies as well and also the wavefunctions.
We will discuss this further in Sec. IV. For now, we sim-
ply point out that the height of the energies of the ex-
cited states above the vacuum grows as ∆p → 0 due to
the negative growth of the vacuum energy as shown in
Fig. 5.

We have also investigated the dependence of the wave-
functions on the momentum grid spacing. In Fig. 6, we
have plotted the same wavefunctions that we plotted in
Fig. 2, but with diﬀerent values of ∆p. We have also

FIG. 6: A plot of the absolute values of the coeﬃcients of the
wavefunction divided by the square root of the basis-state
spacing for a few eigenstates. These wavefunctions were ob-
tained by a numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in
Eq. (10) with the parameters given in Eq. (19) except for ∆p.
The value of ∆p for each series are as follows: (solid blue)
∆p = 0.05GeV, (dashed orange) ∆p = 0.025GeV, (dotted
green) ∆p = 0.01GeV, and (dot-dashed red) ∆p = 0.005GeV.

ﬁrst excited state and the bottom plot is for the ‘ﬁftieth’ ex-
cited state. Further details can be found in Subsection III A.

changed how we normalize the plot. In Fig. 2, we plotted
the raw coeﬃcients of the basis states so that the discrete
sum of the squares of the points adds to one. However,
in this plot, by contrast, we have normalized the contin-
uum by dividing by the square root of the spacing be-

peak. For the bottom plot, that is true for both the peak
at 2GeV and at just above 5GeV and is a general feature
of the eigenstates.

There are two properties that transition as we move
from lower eigenstates to higher ones. The ﬁrst is the con-
tribution from the continuum outside of the peak region.
Beginning with the ﬁrst two-particle state and continuing
through the eigenstate with an energy of approximately
2.5GeV, the contribution outside the peak decreases as
∆p decreases. However, as we move towards higher eigen-
states, this diﬀerence is reduced until it vanishes and is
reversed. By the time the ‘ﬁftieth’ eigenstate is reached,
for example, we can see that the contribution from the
continuum increases outside the peak as ∆p decreases.
This pattern is also followed by the continuum in the case
of the vacuum. The second property to transition is the
discrete contribution of the free vacuum. For the lowest
eigenstates, including the vacuum and ﬁrst two-particle
eigenstate shown as the top two plots, the contribution
of the free vacuum decreases with decreasing ∆p. The
decrease in the free vacuum is very slight, however, and
it still dominates the vacuum eigenstate for all values of
∆p as can be seen in the top plot where all the dots
are practically on top of each other. For concreteness,
we list the free-vacuum contribution for the vacuum. Its
coeﬃcient is 0.99, 0.98, 0.96 and 0.94, respectively for de-
creasing values of ∆p. Again, a transition occurs around
the eigenstate with a peak at approximately 2.5GeV. For
lower eigenstates, the trend is for the the free-vacuum to
make a smaller contribution for smaller ∆p. However,
for higher eigenstates, the trend is for the free-vacuum to
make larger contributions for smaller ∆p.

This transition may at ﬁrst seem strange since it ap-
pears at the surface that the entire wavefunction is in-
creasing for the higher eigenstates which would seem to
violate normalization. However, we note again that the
peak gets taller and narrower as ∆p decreases. In Fig. 7,
we have plotted a magniﬁed view of the peak from the
bottom plot of Fig. 6, where we can see this behavior for
the ‘ﬁftieth’ two-particle state. As this occurs, there is a
competition between the area under the peak decreasing
due to a narrower peak and the area increasing due to a
taller peak, and this aﬀects the rest of the wavefunction.
For the vacuum, the peak is discrete. Since it decreases
slightly, the continuum must increase to make up for it.
For the excited states on the other hand, it depends on
how close the peak is to the edge of the continuum. If it
is very close, if the peak is to the left of approximately
2.5GeV, then the area under the peak is larger and the
continuum and free vacuum go down.
If, on the other
hand, it is far from the edge, if the peak is to the right of
approximately 2.5GeV, then the area under the peak is
smaller and the continuum and free-vacuum go up. For
concreteness, the free-vacuum contributions to the ‘ﬁfti-
eth’ two-particle state are 0.00541, 0.00546, 0.00561 and
0.00589, respectively for decreasing values of ∆p.

tween the points. With this normalization, the integral
of the square of the continuum curve plus the square of
the free-vacuum coeﬃcient equals one. Because of this,
although the continuum curves in this plot look qualita-
tively diﬀerent than those in Fig. 2, the solid blue curves
are actually exactly the same. The reason the change
in normalization was necessary is that when we change
the momentum grid spacing, the number of basis states
changes with it. As the number of basis states increases,
each coeﬃcient is reduced to keep the discrete normaliza-
tion the same. This multiplicity of basis states reduction
is not the crucial point, however. What we want to com-
pare is the coeﬃcient after removing this multiplicity of
states reduction. By dividing by the basis-state spacing,
we have removed this reduction and can directly com-
pare the coeﬃcients for diﬀerent values of ∆p, as given
in Fig. 6.

A comment is in order about the bottom plot of
Fig. 6, labeled as the ‘ﬁftieth’ two-particle state. This
is the wavefunction for the ﬁftieth two-particle state
when ∆p = 0.05GeV. However,
it is actually the
ninety-ninth two-particle state when ∆p = 0.025GeV,
the two-hundred-fourty-sixth two-particle state when
∆p = 0.01GeV and the four-hundred-ninety-ﬁrst two-
particle state when ∆p = 0.005GeV. The property that
all of these eigenstates have in common is that they
are the states that are dominated by the basis state
|(−2.45GeV, 1), (2.45GeV, 1)(cid:105). On the other hand, the
top plot is the vacuum for all ∆p and the middle plot is
the ﬁrst two-particle state for all ∆p.

The dots and curves correspond with the following
values of ∆p: (solid blue) ∆p = 0.05GeV, (dashed or-
ange) ∆p = 0.025GeV, (dotted green) ∆p = 0.01GeV
and (dot-dashed red) ∆p = 0.005GeV. In general, all the
eigenstates have the feature that the peak in the contin-
uum becomes narrower and taller with decreasing ∆p (see
Fig. 7 for example). In all three cases, the dot-dashed red
peak (for ∆p = 0.005GeV) is the narrowest and tallest

over a broad range of λ for a few eigenstates in the top
plot of Fig. 8. In solid blue, at the bottom, we see that
the vacuum energy peaks at 0GeV when λ = 0 and drops
towards negative values for both positive and negative λ.
Its shape appears to be quadratic near λ = 0 and nearly
linear for larger absolute values of λ. The other eigen-
values, on the other hand, all appear to have a linear de-
pendence on λ with a positive slope, increasing towards
larger values of λ. This is not surprising since the non-
free part of the Hamiltonian depends linearly on λ [see
Eqs. (12) through (18)]. The single-particle state energy
is plotted in dashed orange and is directly above the vac-

is plotted in dotted green and is directly above the one-

uum when λ >∼ −1.3GeV2. The lowest two-particle state
particle state for λ >∼ −1.3GeV2. It has a greater slope
than the one-particle state eigenvalue and so crosses the
one-particle eigenvalue at λ ∼ −1.3GeV2 at an energy of
0GeV (the energy of the lowest two-particle state is al-
ways twice that of the single-particle state). This greater
slope is also not surprising since the coeﬃcient of λ for
(cid:104)(0GeV, 2)|H|(0GeV, 2)(cid:105) in Eq. (16) is a little more than
double the coeﬃcient of λ for (cid:104)(0GeV, 1)|H|(0GeV, 1)(cid:105)
in Eq. (12). This comes from the fact that the basis
state in (cid:104)(0GeV, 2)|H|(0GeV, 2)(cid:105) has twice as many par-
ticles and, therefore, twice the free energy. To the left
of ∼ −1.3GeV2, the eigenvalues of the one-particle state
and the lowest two-particle state are inverted and the
lowest two-particle state becomes lower in energy than
the single-particle state. Of all the eigenvalues depen-
dence on λ, the lowest two-particle state energy has the
greatest slope. As we go to higher two-particle states,
they begin with a greater energy at λ = 0 and have
slopes that are slightly smaller than the state below
them. Other two-particle state energies cross below the
single-particle state energy for more negative values of
λ < −1.3GeV2. The dot-dashed red line is the energy of
the ﬁftieth two-particle state.

We do not know for certain whether having two-
particle states pass below the single-particle state in en-
ergy is a sickness of the theory. However, it certainly
seems strange. Moreover, since it occurs for large nega-
tive values of λ, where we do not usually consider the
theory stable, we will henceforth consider only λ >
−1.3GeV2. Furthermore, since the slopes of the two-
particle states become increasingly shallower as the en-
ergy increases, the two-particle state energies will begin
crossing each other at large positive values of λ. For this

reason, we will focus on |λ| <∼1GeV2 for the remainder of

this subsection.

In the bottom plot of Fig. 8, we show a magniﬁcation
of the vacuum energy on a log-log plot where we see that
it follows a simple power-law scaling. We have found the
best ﬁt line for the vacuum energy. It is

Evac(λ) = −4.41GeV−0.94λ1.94 .

(24)

App. C gives a brief argument for this dependence on
λ. As expected, we ﬁnd that the vacuum energy goes to
zero as λ does. We also ﬁnd that the dependence on λ is

FIG. 8: A plot of the energy eigenvalues as a function of
λ. In the top plot, the vacuum is in solid blue, the single-
particle state is in dashed orange, the ﬁrst two-particle state
is in dotted green and the ﬁftieth two-particle state is in dot-
dashed red. The bottom plot is a magniﬁcation of the vacuum
energy on a log-log plot. The inset formula is the best ﬁt
curve for the vacuum energy. The other parameters are given
in Eq. (19). The eigenvalues were obtained by a numerical

free and the eigenvalues match the free energies exactly
and the wavefunctions become delta functions. We have
checked this limit with our numerical code and get agree-
ment. On the other hand, we would also like to know
what happens as we vary λ over a broad range of val-
ues. Although, we usually prefer to keep λ positive to
maintain the stability of the vacuum, we will consider
both positive and negative values of λ in this subsec-
tion. Although negative values of λ may indeed destabi-
lize the vacuum in the full theory, in our severely trun-
cated Hilbert space, we ﬁnd that the vacuum remains
stable for λ between the −2GeV2 and 2GeV2 that we
tested.

We begin by plotting the dependence of the energies

FIG. 9: A plot of the absolute values of the coeﬃcients of the wavefunction for a few eigenstates. These wavefunctions were
obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) with the parameters given in Eq. (19) except for λ.
The value of λ for each series are as follows: (solid blue) λ = ±0.01GeV2, (dashed orange) λ = ±0.1GeV2 and (dotted green)
λ = ±1GeV2. The left column is for negative λ while the right column is for positive λ. The top row is for the vacuum state,

quadratic as we observed from the top plot. We ﬁnd it
interesting that the power dependence on λ is slightly less
than 2 in exactly the same amount (0.06) as the power
dependence on ∆p is diﬀerent than -1 [see Eq. (23)].

We next turn to the wavefunctions of the eigenstates.
We plot the absolute values of the coeﬃcients of the basis
states for each wavefunction in Fig. 9. We have plotted
the wavefunctions for both negative (left column) and
positive (right column) values of λ. The curves are as

follows: (solid blue) λ = ±0.01GeV2, (dashed orange)
λ = ±0.1GeV2, and (dotted green) λ = ±1GeV2. We
have plotted the coeﬃcients of the basis states directly
and have not divided by the square root of the energy
spacing between states. So, for example, the dashed or-
ange curves on the right correspond directly with those
of Fig. 2.

The ﬁrst thing that we notice is that the wavefunc-
tion is most like a delta function for the smallest ab-

λ = ±0.01GeV2. For larger absolute values of λ, the peak
broadens and other basis states become more important.
This makes sense as mentioned previously. When the
coupling is λ = 0, the theory is absolutely free and the
wavefunction is an exact delta function. When we turn
the coupling on, the basis states surrounding the peak
of the delta function immediately begin to contribute.
This contribution goes to zero in the limit of zero cou-
pling and increases with increasing coupling. If we focus
on the vacuum (the top row of Fig. 9), we see this pro-
cess continuing without much subtlety for all the scanned
values of λ. As λ becomes larger in absolute value, the
peak’s height diminishes and the contribution from the
other basis states increases.

If we next focus on the ﬁrst two-particle state in the
middle row of Fig. 9, we see this same trend on the left
for negative values of λ. However, for positive values of
λ, we see this trend occur at ﬁrst, but then as the value
of λ grows large, the trend begins to reverse somewhat.
Although the wavefunction with the smallest λ (the solid
blue curve) is still the most delta-function like, the dotted
green curve of λ = 0.1GeV2 is more delta-function like
than the dashed orange curve of λ = 1GeV2. This is
because a transition is in the process of occurring where
the ﬁrst two-particle state wavefunction becomes peaked
at a basis state higher than |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105). We will see this
happen for the ﬁftieth two-particle state within our range
of λ next.

Focusing now on the bottom row of Fig. 9 with the
ﬁftieth two-particle state wave function, we see that the
same general trend occurs, but with a new twist. On the
right side, for positive λ, we see that the dotted green
curve (λ = 1GeV2) has a slightly diﬀerent peak posi-
tion. The new peak is at the ﬁfty-ﬁrst two-particle basis
state rather than the ﬁftieth, although the eigenvalue is
still the ﬁftieth two-particle state energy. To make this
transition more clear, we have plotted a magniﬁcation
of the peaks at the top of Fig. 10. We can see that
for small values of λ, the ﬁftieth two-particle eigenstate
has a peak at the ﬁftieth two-particle basis-state, namely
|(−2.45GeV, 1), (2.45GeV, 1)(cid:105). However, as λ becomes
large, the peak shifts over to the ﬁfty-ﬁrst two-particle
basis-state, namely |(−2.50GeV, 1), (2.50GeV, 1)(cid:105). This
transition is gradual as we can see in the bottom plot
of Fig. 10, where we have plotted the coeﬃcient of
|(−2.45GeV, 1), (2.45GeV, 1)(cid:105) in solid blue and the co-
eﬃcient of |(−2.50GeV, 1), (2.50GeV, 1)(cid:105) in dashed or-
ange. For small values of λ the solid blue curve is large
and the dashed orange curve is small. However, around
λ ∼ ±1GeV2, a transition occurs where the solid blue
curve and dashed orange curves cross. For larger abso-
lute values of λ, the curves are inverted with the dashed
orange curve large and the solid blue curve small.

the bottom right plot of Fig. 9. The bottom plot is of the
coeﬃcient of the ﬁftieth (solid blue) and ﬁfty-ﬁrst (dashed
orange) basis states as a function of λ. These wavefunctions
were obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the Hamilto-
nian in Eq. (10) with the parameters given in Eq. (19) except
for λ. Further details can be found in Subsection III B.

C. Dependence on m

We now turn to the dependence of the eigenstates on
the mass parameter. We have scanned over a range of
masses from m = 0.02GeV up to m = 2.00GeV in steps
of 0.01GeV. At the lower end, the mass is below both the
other dimensionful parameters, the momentum spacing
of ∆p = 0.05GeV and the coupling of λ = 0.1GeV2, while
at the higher end, the mass is greater than both the mo-
mentum spacing and the coupling. We begin by plotting
the energy eigenvalues for a few representative masses in
the top plot of Fig. 11. The solid black line represents
the free-particle energies of the basis states for compari-
son. The dots correspond with the eigenvalues. The blue
eigenvalues for m = 1GeV are completely covered by the
orange eigenvalues for m = 0.5GeV, which are partially
covered by the green eigenvalues for m = 0.05GeV.

We ﬁnd that when m (cid:29) √

λ, the energy spectrum

tum spacing m <∼ 2∆p, the energy of the single-particle
state and the vacuum begin to diverge. In order to clarify
this behavior, we have plotted these energy eigenvalues
as a function of m in the bottom plot of Fig. 12. This
behavior is an artiﬁcial feature of the discretization of
the momentum space. Strictly speaking, in Nature, the
momentum spacing is inﬁnitesimal, if not strictly zero.
Therefore, we see that it is important to set the momen-
tum spacing to be well below the free-particle mass in
order to achieve reliable results.

We next turn to the mass dependence of the wave-
functions. As in previous subsections, we plot the vac-
uum, ﬁrst two-particle state and ﬁftieth two-particle
state wavefunctions in Fig. 12. However, we now use
a diﬀerent horizontal axis.
Instead of the free-particle
energies of the basis states, we simply use the ordinal
number of the basis states. That is, |(cid:105) is 0, |(0, 2)(cid:105) is
1, |(−0.05GeV, 1), (0.05GeV, 1)(cid:105) is 2, and so on. These
ordinal numbers are listed in Table I for m = 1GeV. The
reason we have done this is to emphasize the essential as-
pects of their similarities and diﬀerences as we vary the
mass rather than the shift in the free-particle energies of
the basis states on the horizontal axis. The masses for
the lines are as follows, starting with the bottom curve.
The solid blue lines are for m = 2GeV, the dashed or-
ange lines are for m = 1GeV, the dotted green lines are
for m = 0.5GeV, and the dot-dashed red lines are for
m = 0.05GeV. The dashed orange lines (m = 1.00GeV)
correspond with the curves in Fig. 2, the solid blue curves
in Fig. 6, and the dashed orange lines on the right in
Fig. 9.

We see that as the mass increases, the height of the
peak increases and the contribution from the other states
decreases. This is because, as the mass increases, the rel-
ative size of the coupling diminishes leading the theory
closer to the free theory. As this occurs, the wavefunc-
tion is approaching the delta function of the free theory.
On the other hand, as the mass decreases, this trend is
reversed as long as the mass is still larger than the square
root of the coupling and the momentum spacing. How-
ever, when m <∼ 2∆p, the curves begin to change quali-
tatively. The peak begins to shift for all but the vacuum.
In the case of the ﬁrst two-particle state (the middle plot
of Fig. 12), the peak has already shifted to the tenth two-
particle basis state by the time m = 0.05GeV. In the case
of the ﬁftieth two-particle state, the peak has shifted up
one basis state higher. Moreover, the contribution of the
ﬁrst two-particle basis state has signiﬁcantly increased
when m ∼ 0.05GeV. As in the discussion of the energy
eigenvalues, the theory is no longer sensible when the
mass drops near or below the momentum spacing. We
see again that for sensible results, we must keep the mass
well above ∆p.

FIG. 11: The top frame is a plot of the eigenstate energies for
three values of m. The black line gives the diagonal line of
the free energies of the basis states while the colored dots give
the eigenstate energies. The value of m for each series are as
follows. The green dots are for m = 0.05GeV, the orange dots
are for m = 0.5GeV and the blue dots are for m = 1GeV. The
other parameters are given in Eq. (19). The eigenstates were
obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian
in Eq. (10). The bottom plot is the energy of a few eigenstates
as a function of m. The solid blue line is the vacuum energy,
the dashed orange line is the single-particle state, the dotted
green line is the ﬁrst two-particle state and the dot-dashed
red line is the ﬁftieth two-particle state.

asymptotically approaches the free-particle energy of the
basis states. That is, it asymptotically approaches the
diagonal black line. This is because, in this limit, the
coupling is asymptotically vanishing relative to the mass.
Furthermore, in this limit, we ﬁnd that the only change
to the spectrum, as the mass is increased, is a shift up
and to the right by 2∆m. This makes sense since the
eigenvalues are nearly identical with the free-energies of

the basis states and Ef ree = 2(cid:112)p2 + m2. On the other

hand, when the mass is small m <∼
λ, the eigenval-
ues begin to diverge from the free energies of the basis
states, especially at the lower end. Furthermore, we see
that when the mass parameter drops below the momen-

FIG. 13: Plots of the eigenstate energies for diﬀerent values
of the cutoﬀ momentum.
In the top plot, the black dots
give the free energies of the basis states while the colored
dots give the eigenstate energies. The value of the cutoﬀ
momentum for each series are as follows from top right to
bottom left: (blue) 85GeV, (orange) 75GeV, (green) 65GeV,
(red) 55GeV, (purple) 45GeV, (brown) 35GeV, (blue) 25GeV,
(yellow) 15GeV and (purple) 5GeV. The other parameters
are given in Eq. (19). The eigenstates were obtained by a
numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (10). The
bottom plot is of individual eigenvalues as a function of the
cutoﬀ energy. The solid blue line is for the vacuum, the dashed

rameter is unphysical. Nature corresponds with the limit
pcut → ∞. In our numerical calculations, we would like
to take it as large as possible while still achieving eﬃcient
diagonalization. In this section, we analyze the depen-
dence of the solutions on this cutoﬀ.

As we extend the momentum cutoﬀ towards higher
energies, a greater number of basis states are allowed in
our truncated Hilbert space. Therefore, we expect our
energy spectrum to also extend towards larger energies.
This is indeed, what we ﬁnd. In the top plot of Fig. 13,
we have plotted the energy spectrum for a series of cutoﬀ
momenta. The spectrum of the smallest momentum cut-

cept for m. The value of m for each series are as follows
from bottom to top: (solid blue) m = 2GeV, (dashed orange)
m = 1GeV, (dotted green) m = 0.5GeV, and (dot-dashed
red) m = 0.05GeV. The top plot is for the vacuum state, the
middle plot is for the ﬁrst two-particle state and the bottom

sponds with the left-most column of Table I for m = 1GeV.

(5GeV) is plotted in purple and only extends to just
above 10GeV. The spectrum of the next higher momen-
tum cutoﬀ (15GeV) is plotted in yellow and extends a bit
further to just above 30GeV. This trend continues with
the spectrum of each momentum cutoﬀ extending a bit
further towards the top right. The momentum cutoﬀ in
this plot is taken in increments of 10GeV with the ﬁnal
momentum cutoﬀ being 85GeV and plotted in blue and
extending to just above 170GeV.

As we can see, on this scale, the energy eigenvalues es-
sentially lie directly on top of each other where the basis
states overlap at the bottom left. The main diﬀerence be-
tween the spectra is that, for larger momentum cutoﬀs,
the spectrum extends to larger energies. This is a good
sign and appears to signal that the energies are largely
insenstive to the cutoﬀ energy. To clarify this, we plot
in the bottom of Fig. 13 a few eigenvalues as functions
of the cutoﬀ momentum. The solid blue line is for the
vacuum, the dashed orange line is for the single-particle
state, the dotted green line is for the ﬁrst two-particle
state and the dot-dashed red line is for the ﬁftieth two-
particle state. We can see that all of these eigenvalues
are practically constant except at the left edge where a
small deviation can be seen. This is reassuring and sug-
gests that our cutoﬀ of 10GeV is probably suﬃcient for
our purposes. We would not expect this behavior in full
four-dimensional φ4 theory as the mass is quadratically
sensitive to the cutoﬀ. However, here in two dimensions,
the mass is only logarithmically sensitive to the cutoﬀ so,
in the context of the current severely truncated Hilbert
space, this behavior seems reasonable. It will be inter-
esting to see what happens when greater numbers of free
particles are included in the basis states.

We now turn to the wavefunctions, which we plot for
diﬀerent values of the cutoﬀ momentum in Fig. 14. The
ﬁrst thing we see is that, as the cutoﬀ momentum grows,
so does the extension of the wavefunction towards higher
basis states. Because of this, we can clearly distinguish
the curves for diﬀerent cutoﬀ energies. The bottom solid
blue curve is for a cutoﬀ of 5GeV, the dashed orange line
directly above this is for a cutoﬀ of 15GeV and so on in
increments of 10GeV. The top dashed purple curve is for
a cutoﬀ of 85GeV.

Another feature of the cutoﬀ dependence of the wave-
functions is that they broaden around the peak as the
cutoﬀ grows. The height of the peak lowers a tiny amount
and the states to the sides of the peak increase slightly
in importance. The change is greatest from a cutoﬀ of
5GeV to 15GeV, and decreases as the cutoﬀ grows larger.
That is, the diﬀerence between the wavefunctions for cut-
oﬀs of 75GeV and 85GeV is much smaller than the dif-
ference between the wavefunctions for cutoﬀs of 5GeV
and 15GeV. The reason for this is that as the wavefunc-
tion extends to higher basis states, the contribution to
the normalization from these states suddenly turns on.
Since the higher basis states are contributing, the lower
basis states must adjust to keep the normalization ﬁxed.
On the other hand, the higher basis states contribute

wavefunction for a few eigenstates. These wavefunctions were
obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian
in Eq. (10) with the parameters given in Eq. (19) except for
the cutoﬀ momentum. The value of the cutoﬀ momentum for
each series are as follows from bottom to top of the contin-
uum: (solid blue) 5GeV, (dashed orange) 15GeV and so on
in increments of 10GeV up to a cutoﬀ of 85GeV (in dashed

a very small, exponentially decreasing, amount to the
lower eigenstate wavefunctions, so the importance of this
diminishes as the cutoﬀ momentum grows.

We see that, although the wavefunctions are aﬀected

momentum cutoﬀs are better, the eﬀect is not enormous.
Moreover, since the number of basis states in the Hilbert
space grows with the cutoﬀ momentum and reduces the
eﬀectiveness of the numerical diagonalization, a balance
is necessary. It appears to us that a cutoﬀ of 10GeV in
the present calculation is suﬃcient to understand the be-
havior of the energies and the wavefunctions and that the
numerical power might be better used analyzing the eﬀect
of a reduction of ∆p when we consider renormalization
in the next section. We do not expect the dependence on
the cutoﬀ momentum to add much to the discussion of
renormalization.

IV. RENORMALIZATION

In Subsection III A, we saw that as ∆p becomes
smaller, the energy gap grows ever larger due to the
growth of the vacuum energy towards negative inﬁnity
while the other eigenvalues remain essentially unchanged.
In fact, we found that the vacuum energy was inversely
proportional to ∆p [see Eq. (23)], suggesting that it
would diverge as ∆p → 0. Of course, the physical en-
ergies are ﬁnite in this limit and, in any case, we must
renormalize the parameters in order to keep the observ-

ables at their physical values.
renormalize λ and m.
In Subsection III B, we saw the
dependence of the eigenvalues on λ. The non-vacuum
eigenvalues grew linearly with λ while the magnitude of
the vacuum energy grew proportional to λ2 [see Eq. (24)].
Furthermore, we know that, whatever the value of ∆p, as
we take the limit λ → 0, the theory becomes completely
decoupled, the eigenvalues merge with the free energies
and the wavefunctions become delta functions. So, it is
clear that we can reverse the trend resulting from a de-
crease in ∆p with a suitable reduction of λ. As we do
this, we also expect to be required to adjust the mass as
well to precisely ﬁt the observable values. This is indeed
what we ﬁnd.

In order to achieve a renormalization, we must
choose a set of observables to ﬁx as we decrease ∆p
and adjust the parameters. Two natural choices are
the energy gap of the single-particle state which is
the height of the single-particle state above the vac-
uum and the energy gap of the lowest two-particle
state, again the height of its eigenvalue above the vac-
uum. We set these two observables equal to the value
we obtained with the reference parameters given in
Eq. 19, respectively 1.08GeV+0.05GeV=1.13GeV and
2.15GeV+0.05GeV=2.20GeV, which we take to be ob-
servable. We then scan the values we obtain for these
observables for a range of values of λ and m for a series
of decreasing ∆p in Fig. 15. The observable mass gap of
the single-particle state is plotted in solid black while the
observable energy gap of the lowest two-particle state is
plotted in dashed red. We then take the intersection of
these curves as the renormalized values of the parame-

above the vacuum as for the reference point. The red dashed
curve represents when the lowest two-particle energy is the
same height above the vacuum as for the reference point. The
blue dotted curve represents when the vacuum has the same
value as for the reference point. The purple dot-dashed curve

the free vacuum as for the reference point.

parameter values where the vacuum has the same en-
ergy as for the reference parameters, namely -0.05GeV.
Interestingly, it intersects the solid black and dashed red
curves at the same parameter point where they cross each
other. The reason for this is that the eigenvalue of the
lowest two-particle state is twice the eigenvalue of the
single-particle state as described in Subsec. III B. There-
fore, the point at which their energy gaps from the vac-
uum agree would naturally coincide with the point where
the vacuum had the same energy as well. In other words,
these two energy gaps are correlated and may not serve
as independent observables for the purpose of renormal-
ization.

Normally in high energy physics, we can use the scat-
tering amplitude as an independent observable for renor-
malization. As discussed in Sec. II D, our Hilbert space
is too severely truncated to allow non-trivial scattering,
so this won’t work here. But, we consider as the closest
alternative the magnitude of the coeﬃcient of one of the
basis states for one of the eigenstates. We choose the
coeﬃcient of the free vacuum in the vacuum state, the
left-most red dot in the top plot of Fig. 2, which has a
value of 0.991 for the reference parameters in Eq. (19).
We ﬁx that as one of our observables and plot in Fig. 15,
in dot-dashed purple, the parameter values where this
coeﬃcient is equal to 0.991. We observe that this curve
also crosses the other three curves at exactly the same
parameter point so that all four curves cross at the same
point. Therefore, we ﬁnd that several reasonable choices
of observables give the same renormalization point and,
in fact, we will see soon that all the energy eigenval-
ues coincide with the reference values for this choice
of renormalized parameters. We take this as a posi-
tive sign for our calculation and settle on the intersec-
tion points in Fig. 15 as our renormalized parameters.
Their values are λ = 0.0723GeV2 and m = 1.02GeV for
∆p = 0.025GeV, λ = 0.0463GeV2 and m = 1.04GeV for
∆p = 0.01GeV, and λ = 0.0331GeV2 and m = 1.05GeV
for ∆p = 0.005GeV.

We have plotted the renormalized values of λ and m
as functions of ∆p in Fig. 16 along with their best ﬁt
curves. The top plot is for the mass and the best ﬁt
curve of lowest order was quadratic and has the form

m(∆p) = 1.06GeV − 1.90∆p + 13.9GeV−1∆p2 .

(25)

The mass does not appear to require an inﬁnite renor-
malization as ∆p → 0. In fact, it appears to approach
the ﬁnite value of approximately 1.06GeV in the limit
∆p → 0 which is only approximately six percent above
the value of the parameter m when ∆p = 0.05GeV. Fur-
thermore, it is only approximately six percent below the
observable mass gap of 1.13GeV and only a couple per-
cent below the energy eigenvalue for the single-particle
state of 1.08GeV. Perhaps more data extending to lower
∆p would alter this extrapolation and bring it closer to
one of these. We are unable to do this at this point but
hope to do so in a future work.

FIG. 16: Plots of the renormalized parameters as a function
of ∆p. The top plot is for the mass parameter m while the
bottom plot is for the coupling parameter λ. Additionally,
the formulas for the best-ﬁt curves are displayed. The renor-
malized parameters come from the intersections of the curves
in Fig. 15.

The renormalized coupling λ is plotted in the bottom
of Fig. 16 on a log-log plot. We can see that the renor-
malized points are ﬁt very well by a straight line on a
log-log plot giving us the expression

λ(∆p) = 0.424GeV1.52∆p0.48 .

(26)
We can clearly see that λ → 0 as ∆p → 0 as we expected.
We also see that the power of ∆p is essentially 1/2 and
we understand that it comes from the combined power-
law dependence of the vacuum energy on ∆p and λ seen
in Eqs. (23) and (24). If we simply take the product of
these at the renormalization point, then we have for the
renormalized value of the vacuum energy

FIG. 17: A magniﬁcation of the beginning of the two-
particle continuum of energies. The black line is the free
energies for reference. The other eigenvalues are as fol-
lows: (blue) ∆p =0.05GeV, (yellow) ∆p =0.025GeV, (green)
∆p =0.01GeV, and (red) ∆p =0.005GeV. The values of λ and
m are given in Sec. IV.

Now that we have the renormalized values of the pa-
rameters for diﬀerent values of ∆p, we would like to see
how the other observables are aﬀected by this change.
First of all, the eigenvalues are all exactly the same as
for the reference point in Eq. (19). This is extremely
encouraging as it suggests that our numerical procedure
does a very good job of obtaining these eigenvalues and
they don’t diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the limit ∆p → 0. In
order to see what is happening with the eigenvalues dur-
ing renormalization, we plot in Fig. 17 a magniﬁcation
of the two-particle eigenvalues at the beginning of the
continuum. ∆p gets smaller as we move from the blue
points at the left towards the red points at the right.
The ﬁrst thing we see is that the spacing becomes smaller
as ∆p becomes smaller as we expect. Secondly, we see
that the eigenvalue of the ﬁrst two-particle state is con-
stant. This is as we expect since this is precisely one of
our renormalization conditions.
In particular, we have
noted that as we decrease ∆p, we are forced to decrease
λ to compensate. However, this alone would cause the
energy spectrum to shift vertically down from the blue
dots. In order to compensate this eﬀect, we also increase
m slightly, which causes the lowest eigenvalue to increase
up and to the right to end at the position of the lowest red
point (for ∆p = 0.005GeV). With this combination, the
renormalized energies have exactly the same energy as
before, when considering the equivalent state as we will
see when we discuss the energy of the ‘ﬁftieth’ eigenstate.
We next plot the renormalized wavefunctions in
Fig. 18. This plot presents a challenge for comparison
because we have changed both ∆p and m between the
curves, each of which makes direct comparison of wave-
functions more diﬃcult. Because the change in ∆p is
much more signiﬁcant than the change in m, we have
chosen to normalize the wavefunctions in the same way
as in Sec. III A; we have divided the coeﬃcients by the

FIG. 18: A plot of the absolute values of the coeﬃcients
of the wavefunction for a few eigenstates. These wavefunc-
tions were obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) with the renormalized parameters
described in Sec. IV. The lines are as follows: (solid blue)
∆p = 0.05GeV, (dashed orange) ∆p = 0.025GeV, (dotted
green) ∆p = 0.01GeV, and (dot-dashed red) ∆p = 0.005GeV.

square root of the spacing between basis states. This
gives a better comparison between the wavefunctions for
diﬀerent ∆p. On the other hand, as we vary m, we shift
the free-particle energies of the basis states. In the con-
text of the wavefunctions, this shifts the continuum to
the right by roughly 2∆m. However, this shift is not

is unmeasureable. All we can measure are the eigenstate
energies. In principle, we could compensate by shifting
all the wavefunctions to the left by an equal amount in
order to have the peaks line up again, although each coef-
ﬁcient would no longer be above the free-particle energy
of its basis state. This appears unnecessary to us, espe-
cially since the change in mass is so small. Moreover, we
feel clarity is better served to simply leave the wavefunc-
tion coeﬃcients above the free-particle energies of the
basis states and simply note that the slight shift to the
right of the peaks is unphysical.

√

The lines in Fig. 18 are as follows. The solid blue
lines are for ∆p = 0.05GeV, the dashed orange lines
are for ∆p = 0.025GeV, the dotted green lines are for
∆p = 0.01GeV, and the dot-dashed red lines are for
∆p = 0.005GeV. The top plot is for the vacuum state.
Interestingly, the wavefunctions nearly exactly coincide.
The free-vacuum contribution is exactly the same for all
∆p, as expected from our normalization condition as de-
scribed above, and dominates the wavefunction with a
value of 0.991. If we consider the continuum, the only
major diﬀerence is that the peak at the position of the
ﬁrst two-particle state is shifted slightly to the right, as
described in the preceding paragraph, and also that the
peak becomes slightly higher as ∆p decreases. To under-
stand this better, we have plotted the height of this peak
as a function of ∆p in the top plot of Fig. 19. We ﬁnd that
the height of this peak is given by 0.1GeV0.5/
∆p and,
therefore, diverges as ∆p → 0. What is happening seems
clear. The total area under the wavefunction squared is
constant. The contribution of the free vacuum dominates
and does not change. The contribution from most of the
continuum grows larger as ∆p diminishes [see the top
plot of Fig. 6] while it grows smaller as λ diminishes [see
the top right plot of Fig. 9]. The combined eﬀect of re-
duced ∆p and λ is that the two eﬀects largely cancel each
other and the contribution from most of the continuum
remains the same. The peak is slightly diﬀerent. Since
it gets shifted slightly to the right, it must make up for
the loss of area under the previously extended curve and,
therefore, it must grow. It also becomes narrower with
the result that the area under this small section of the
wavefunction (squared) remains constant. In the limit of
∆p → 0, this peak becomes initesimal in width and inﬁ-
nite in height in such a way as to preserve the area under
the squared wavefunction. Although similar to a delta
function, it is not exactly the same due to its normaliza-
tion and shape. Remembering that the total area under
the squared wavefunction is one and that the free vacuum
dominates it with a contribution of 0.9912=0.982, we see
that the area under this squared peak approaches a ﬁnite
constant that is less than 0.02, and therefore, much less
than one.

FIG. 19: A plot of: the height of the peak at the beginning of
the continuum of the vacuum (top), the top of the peak in the
ﬁrst two-particle state (middle), the free vacuum contribution
in the ﬁrst two-particle state (top line of bottom), and the
contribution of the right-most point of the continuum in the
ﬁrst two-particle state (bottom line of bottom). All the data
come from Fig. 18. The lines and formulas are the best-ﬁt
curves.

In the middle plot of Fig. 18, we ﬁnd the wavefunctions
for the ﬁrst two-particle state. In this case, we see from
the middle plot of Fig. 6 that the continuum surrounding
the peak decreases as ∆p decreases and we explained this

behavior in Sec. III A. In the present context, we see that
when combining this with the fact that the continuum
surrounding the peak also decreases with decreasing λ
(due to greater decoupling), the continuum surrounding

ized here and that is what we ﬁnd. The same statement
applies to the contribution from the free-vacuum. The
peak, on the other hand, grows larger.
In part this is
because the position of the peak shifts slightly to the
right and therefore must make up for the loss of area un-
der it by becoming higher as discussed for the vacuum
in the previous paragraph. In part, this is also due to
the reduction of importance of the other states to the
wavefunction. We have plotted the height of the peak
at |(0GeV, 2)(cid:105) in the middle of Fig. 19. We see that it
grows as 1/∆p and becomes inﬁnite as ∆p → 0. This is
similar to our remarks in the previous paragraph except
that here this peak dominates the area under the squared
wavefunction. In fact, in this case, the rest of the wave-
function diminishes as ∆p → 0 so that this peak becomes
more and more dominant the smaller ∆p becomes.
In
fact, we ﬁnd that the contribution from the free vacuum
(the left-most dot in the middle plot of Fig. 18) falls oﬀ
as 1/∆p1.4 and the contribution from the highest basis
state (the right-most point of the middle plot of Fig. 18)
falls oﬀ as 1/∆p1.5. We have plotted both of these in the
bottom frame of Fig. 19. It appears that the wavefunc-
tion of the ﬁrst two-particle state approaches very close
to a true delta function.

Finally, the bottom plot of Fig. 18 contains the ‘ﬁfti-
eth’ two-particle state, where in order to determine the
‘ﬁftieth’ two-particle state we use the same procedure
as in Sec. III A. It is deﬁned as the ﬁftieth two-particle
state when ∆p = 0.05GeV. It is deﬁned to be the
state that has a peak at the same free-particle energy
for the other values of ∆p when m is held constant.
That is, we have chosen the same states here as we did
in Sec. III A. It is the ninety-ninth two-particle state
when ∆p = 0.025GeV, the two-hundred-fourty-sixth two-
particle state when ∆p = 0.01GeV and the four-hundred-
ninety-ﬁrst two-particle state when ∆p = 0.005GeV. Be-
cause we chose it exactly as we did in Sec. III A, the peak
shifts slightly to the right here in Fig. 18. A magniﬁed
view of the peak can be seen in the top plot of Fig. 20.
However, we reiterate, this shift is unphysical and only
due to the change in the mass parameter m. It is only be-
cause the free-particle energy of the basis states is slightly
increased as a result. To further make the point that this
shift is unphysical, we note that the eigenstate energy for
all of these states is 5.35GeV, exactly the same and inde-
pendent of ∆p (after renormalization). We again see that
the renormalization point is unique. We could also have
used this energy for the renormalization, but it would
have given us the same renormalized parameter points.
Thus, we see that, although shifted on this plot, these do
correspond to the same physical state.

In the case of the ‘ﬁftieth’ two-particle state, we see
that the continuum surrounding the peak decreases with
decreasing ∆p. As in the previous two cases, this is the
result of the combined eﬀect of a reduced ∆p and a re-
duced λ. Similarly to the vacuum, we see in the bottom
plot of Fig. 6 that the continuum surrounding the peak

increases with decreasing ∆p. However, the increase is
much smaller than in the case of the vacuum seen in the
top plot of Fig. 6. So, in this case, the reduction due
to a decreasing λ, as seen in the bottom plot of Fig. 9,
dominates and the renormalized wavefunction decreases

around the peak as ∆p decreases. Focusing on the top
plot of Fig. 20, we see that, additionally, the peak nar-
rows and increases in height. This is the behavior result-
ing from both a decrease in ∆p as we can see in Fig. 7 and
a decrease in λ as we can see in the top plot of Fig. 10 (for
small λ). So, this behavior is not surprising here. In fact,
we have plotted the height of the peak as a function of ∆p
in the middle plot of Fig. 20 and can see that the height
of the peak grows as 1/
∆p and so becomes inﬁnite as
∆p → 0. Once again, we are seeing the formation of a
delta function as we approach the continuum limit where
∆p → 0. We suspect that the area under the squared
curve is approaching nearly one, and indeed it is as we
can see in the bottom plot of Fig. 20. In this plot, we have
shown the area under the squared peak where the width
is taken from the points directly to the sides of the peak.
For example, for ∆p = 0.05GeV, we have taken the area
from 5.2GeV to 5.39GeV whereas for ∆p = 0.005GeV,
we have taken the area from 5.32GeV to 5.34GeV. In
greater precision, our ∆p = 0 intercept is 0.99996GeV
suggesting that there is a very small amount of the area
(0.00004GeV) given by the regions of the wavefunction
outside the peak.

The renormalization appears to be very satisfying to
our eyes. We are able to ﬁx several observables and, in
this severely truncated Hilbert space at least, they all
give the same renormalized values for the parameters as
∆p → 0. Second, after renormalizing the parameters,
the eigenstate energies, and indeed the energy gap above
the vacuum, appear stable and, in fact, retain the same
values as ∆p → 0. This gives us hope that this method
of numerically diagonalizing the truncated Hamiltonian
of ﬁeld theory may be able to produce sensible and useful
results as this method is further developed. We also ﬁnd
that the vacuum wavefunction is largely unaﬀected by
∆p → 0 after renormalization and that the only major
change is that the minor peak at the beginning of the con-
tinuum becomes narrower and taller while preserving its
small contribution to the overall area under the squared
wavefunction. For the other eigenstates, the wavefunc-
tion is more greatly altered by the reduction of ∆p, even
after the renormalization. However, it appears that we
understand its behavior as ∆p → 0. The wavefunction
outside the peaks drops with decreasing ∆p reducing its
contribution to the area under the squared wavefunction
while the peaks become narrower and taller preserving
their contribution to the area under the squared wave-
function. In fact, we explicitly showed this for the main
peak of the ‘ﬁftieth’ two-particle state, where we plot-
ted the area under the squared peak and showed that it
approached one as ∆p → 0.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have suggested a new non-
perturbative approach to calculating the S matrix that
complements existing perturbative eﬀorts. It involves the

22

direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a suitably
truncated Hilbert space that is ﬁnite and uses the inner
product of the eigenstates to determine the S matrix. In
Sec. I, we have introduced a simple test theory to develop
this technique, a λφ4 theory in two space-time dimen-
sions. We have shown how to discretize the Hamiltonian
and cut it oﬀ in order to make it ﬁnite and amenable
to numerical diagonalization. We have also worked out
the Hamiltonian matrix elements for a Hilbert space that
only includes up to two free particles in its basis states.
We wrote a code that calculated this Hamiltonian ma-
trix numerically and diagonalized it and we discussed
our results in the remainder of this paper.
In Sec. II,
we introduced our illustrative reference set of parameter
values and described our results for this reference set of
parameters, including their dependence on the time. In
Subsec. II A, we showed the energy spectrum resulting
from our diagonalization in Fig. 1. We found an en-
ergy gap between the vacuum, the one-particle state and
the beginning of the two-particle state continuum. We
found that the energies of the two-particle eigenstates
grew nearly linearly with their free-particle eneriges and
we found that the eigenvalues were independent of time.
In Subsec. II B, we displayed the absolute value of the
coeﬃcients of the wavefunctions in Fig. 2. We found that
these wavefunctions were strongly peaked at one partic-
ular basis state. We found that the vacuum is peaked at
the free vacuum, the ﬁrst two-particle state is peaked at
the lowest two-particle basis state and so on. Each state
is peaked at its related basis state with a small contri-
bution from other basis states. We also found that the
moduli of the wavefunction coeﬃcients is independent of
time. In Subsec. II C, we plotted the phases of the co-
eﬃcients of the wavefunctions in Fig. 3 and found that
these phases grew linearly with time at the same rate
independent of the eigenstate. We plotted these rates
of change of the phases in Fig. 4 and showed that these
phase rates agreed exactly with the free energies of the
basis states. We also noted that there was a universal
unitary operator that advanced the eigenstate wavefunc-
tion in time and that the Hamiltonian at a non-zero time
could be obtained as this unitary transformation acting
on the Hamiltonian at t = 0.

In Subsec. II D, we discussed the S matrix in this sim-
ple theory and noted that it was trivial due to the se-
vere truncation of the Hilbert space to only include basis
states with a product of two or fewer free particles. In
particular, each eigenvalue was unique and each eigen-
state was nondegenerate.

In Sec. III, we began a discussion of how the eigen-
values and eigenstate wavefunctions depended on each of
the parameters of the theory. We began with their de-
pendence on the discretized momentum spacing in Sub-
sec. III A. We noted that this parameter ∆p is unphys-
ical and that it should, in principle, be taken to zero.
Although this is impossible in practice, we are able to
study its dependence on ∆p over a wide range of values
of ∆p and extrapolate. In this subsection, we found that

all the eigenvalues other than the vacuum energy were
unsensitive to the value of ∆p. The vacuum energy, on
the other hand, depended inversely on ∆p, as we showed
in Fig. 5. It grew towards larger negative values as ∆p
decreased and became inﬁnite in the limit of ∆p → 0.
We also displayed the wavefunction’s dependence on ∆p
in Fig. 6. The peak became taller and narrower and ap-
proached a constant times a delta function. We showed
a magniﬁed view of the ‘ﬁftieth’ wavefunction in Fig. 7
where this change to the shape was clearly visible.

In Subsec. III B, we turned to the behavior of the so-
lution as we varied the coupling constant λ. We noted
that as λ → 0, the theory becomes absolutely decoupled
and that our numerical results agreed with this result.
In Fig. 8, we showed the dependence of the eigenstate
energies on λ. All the eigenvalues other than the vacuum
energy depended linearly on λ while the vacuum energy
fell oﬀ quadratically with λ for small λ and nearly lin-
early for large λ. We also plotted the wavefunctions in
Fig. 9 and showed that they approached delta functions
as λ → 0.

In Subsec. III C, we described the dependence on the
mass parameter m. We showed in Fig. 11 a plot of the
energy spectrum and how it depended on m. We found
that for sensible results, m must be much greater than
the momentum spacing ∆p. In this limit, we also showed
that the major eﬀect of increasing m was to shift the
entire energy spectrum up and to the right, when the
energies are plotted as a function of the free-particle en-
ergies of the basis states. In Fig. 12, we showed how the
wavefunctions depend on m. Once again, we noted that
the results are only sensible when m (cid:29) ∆p. Within that
region, we noted that the larger m became, the smaller
the relative value of λ and therefore, the closer to de-
coupling. This explained the fact that the wavefunctions
approached (slowly) delta functions as m was increased.
In Subsec. III D, we described the dependence of our
solutions on the cutoﬀ momentum pcut. In Fig. 13, we
showed the dependence of the eigenvalues on this param-
eter.
In particular, other than the availability of more
states in the Hilbert space at higher energy, there was
very little change until the cutoﬀ momentum approached
the physical parameters of the theory. In Fig. 14, we plot-
ted the wavefunctions. We saw that, as for the energy
eigenvalues, the wavefunctions were extended to higher
basis states as a result of increasing the cutoﬀ. Since
these new basis states contributed to the normalization
of the wavefunction, the wavefunction was mildly aﬀected
at the lower basis states as well. However, we found that
the signiﬁcance of this eﬀect was small if the cutoﬀ mo-
mentum was taken large compared to dimensionful pa-
rameters of the theory.

In Sec. IV, we ﬁnally turned our attention to the renor-
malization of our parameters λ and m as we took the
physical limit ∆p → 0. We found that several reason-
able observables gave the same renormalization points as
we decreased ∆p. We showed the intersection of these
observables in Fig. 15, where we can see that all of the

23

lines cross at the same λ, m point. We further found that
with this set of renormalized values of λ and m, all the
eigenvalues remained constant as ∆p → 0, which we took
as a very positive sign for our renormalization procedure.
In Fig. 16, we plotted the dependence of the renormal-
ized λ and m on ∆p. We found that the renormalized
m varied slowly and roughly quadratically, but did not
blow up or go to zero. We extrapolated its value in the
limit ∆p → 0 to be 1.06GeV and noted how close that
was to both the original parameter value and the ob-
λ ∝ √
servable value of the physical mass. We also found that
∆p and described how this came from the depen-
dence of the vacuum energy on both λ and ∆p. With
this, we found that in order to renormalize the observ-
able values, we must take λ → 0 as we take ∆p → 0.
We noted that this makes sense since ∆p → 0 causes
the eigenvalues to blow up whereas λ → 0 causes the
eigenvalues to fall down to the free-particle energies of
the basis states. They have opposite eﬀects, so it makes
sense that by taking them both to zero in an appropriate
way, their eﬀects can largely cancel. Very interestingly,
we see that this is the procedure that replaces absorption
of inﬁnities into bare parameters in perturbation theory.
In Fig. 17, we showed how the energy eigenvalues change
as ∆p becomes smaller and λ and m are renormalized. In
eﬀect, the eigenvalues for the same physical state remain
constant.
In Fig. 18, we show how the wavefunctions are aﬀected
by renormalization as ∆p → 0. We described how its be-
havior was a combination of the behavior when ∆p be-
comes smaller and λ becomes smaller along with a slight
increase in m. We also noted that each of the peaks ap-
proaches a delta function. In fact, in Fig. 19, we showed
how the height of several diﬀerent basis states changed
with ∆p for the vacuum and the ﬁrst two-particle state.
The peaks grow taller and narrower while the other ba-
sis states diminish in size. In Fig. 20, we focused on the
main peak of the ‘ﬁftieth’ two-particle state and showed
that its height increased towards inﬁnity while its width
decreased towards zero. However, we showed that the
area inside this squared peak was stable and slowly ap-
proached nearly one giving very close to a true delta func-
tion.

Finally, in this section, we discussed that the renor-
malization procedure appears very robust. The renor-
malization points appear to be unique in the present case
removing the potential ambiguity in how this should be
done. The energies of the eigenstates are extremely sta-
ble as ∆p → 0 after renormalization and therefore can be
taken, in the limit, as the physical values. The wavefunc-
tions approach closer to delta functions at the dominant
basis state with a small amount of contribution from the
other basis states.

So far, we have only scratched the very tip of the ice-
berg. Our long-term hope is to use this technique to
non-perturbatively study the SM and beyond. We will
tackle projects incrementally as we develop the numeri-
cal technology as well as our theoretical understanding.

For the remainder of this section, we will discuss a few
of our future plans.

Now that we have warmed up with our λφ4 theory in
two space-time dimensions with a Hilbert space that in-
cluded only up to two free particles in the basis states,
there are two important immediate projects to complete.
One is to increase the Hilbert space to include up to four
free particles in the basis states. This will already involve
a planned improvement in the eﬃciency of our diagonal-
ization code. With this enlarged Hilbert space, we will
see how greatly truncating the number of free particles
in the basis states has eﬀected our results. We will also
have the possibility of non-trivial S-matrix elements for
the ﬁrst time since the eigenstates will no longer all be
nondegenerate. Once we have non-trivial S-matrix ele-
ments, we will also be able to analyze the dependence of
scattering amplitudes on the collision energy.

In another related direction, we would like to diag-
onalize the Hamiltonian of λφ4 theory in three space-
time dimensions and better determine the beneﬁts and
drawbacks of only including two space-time dimensions.
Furthermore, although we will only include up to two-
particle basis states in the Hilbert space, because the
particles can have momentum in two dimensions, degen-
eracies will be possible and non-trivial scattering will be
allowed.

Finally, as we increase our understanding of λφ4 the-
ory in the context of this new technique, we would like
to extend the methods described here to other particles
and interactions of the SM, including QED, QCD and
beyond.

Appendix A: Creation and Annihilation Operators

In this appendix, we will brieﬂy review the derivation
of the properties of the creation and annihilation oper-
ators. As described in Section I, we deﬁne our Hilbert-
space basis as the direct product of single-particle states
and label these states as

|(p1, n1), (p2, n2),···(cid:105) ,

(A1)

where pi represents the one-dimensional momentum and
ni represents the multiplicity for that momentum. This
momentum multiplicity notation is not really ideal for
continuous momenta. In contrast, it is very convenient
for discrete momenta, which is the main subect of this pa-
per. Therefore, in this appendix, we will derive the prop-
erties of the creation and annihilation operators in dis-
crete momentum space. Since the single-particle states

24

are orthogonal (and by construction they are normal-
ized), we have the inner product rule
(cid:104)(p(cid:48)

(cid:88)(cid:89)
2)···|(p1, n1), (p2, n2)···(cid:105) =

2, n(cid:48)

(A2)

where the product is over all pairs of momenta and the
sum is over all orderings of the products. Any inner prod-
ucts where momenta with nonzero multiplicities do not
match up are, of course, zero. For example,

(cid:104)(p(cid:48)

1, n(cid:48)

1), (p(cid:48)

(cid:104)(p(cid:48), n(cid:48))|(p, n)(cid:105) = δp(cid:48),pδn(cid:48),n

+δp(cid:48)

With this set of basis states and inner-product rules,
we now deﬁne the creation operator to have the property
that it adds one particle to the basis state
a†

ni + 1|··· (pi, ni + 1)···(cid:105) . (A5)

|··· (pi, ni)···(cid:105) =

√

pi

Other normalizations would not give the correct physical
values for the masses. As a consequence of this deﬁni-
tion, we get that the hermitian conjugate of the creation
operator annihilates a particle from the basis state. We
can see this by inserting the hermitian conjugate of the
creation operator between two general basis states as in

n(cid:48)

1)··· (q, n(cid:48)

q − 1)···(cid:105)

(A7)
q = nq + 1). As a result, we obtain from this the

(since n(cid:48)
rule
aq|(p1, n1)··· (q, nq)···(cid:105) =

√

nq|(p1, n1)··· (q, nq−1)···(cid:105) ,
(A8)
which is exactly the deﬁnition of the annihilation opera-
tor.

Now that we have the creation and annihilation oper-
ators, we can also determine their commutator by acting
on a given basis state in both orders

Appendix B: Numerical Techniques

In order to evaluate the complex hermitian Hamilto-
nian matrix numerically and diagonalize it, we wrote a
C++ code. We implemented a complex number, a matrix
based on that number and a diagonalization routine that
works in two steps. The ﬁrst step uses the Householder
method to tridiagonalize the matrix. This is followed
by a series of Jacobi transformations that drive the ﬁnal
oﬀ-diagonal elements to zero. Once this was done, the
Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) was implemented and diagonal-
ized. We will very brieﬂy describe the diagonalization
steps below.

As we mentioned, the ﬁrst step of the diagonalization
uses the Householder method to transform the matrix to
tridiagonal form where all entries are zero except the di-
agonal and the elements directly above and below the di-
agonal. This step occurs as a series of n unitary transfor-
mations, where the Hamiltonian matrix is n× n and each
transformation zeros all the elements of a row and col-
umn except the diagonal and the element directly above
and below the diagonal in that row and column. Further-
more, this routine keeps track of the product of unitary
transformations in order to obtain the eigenvectors at the
end. Our code is based on the description in Numerical
Recipes [26], but modiﬁcations to allow for complex num-
bers and parallelization using OpenMP [27] were added.
Several checks of this code were performed including test-
ing whether the ﬁnal unitary transformation (the product
of the individual unitary transformations) directly tria-
diagonalized the original matrix and gave the same result
as that obtained by the routine in the ﬁrst place.

The second step uses the so-called QR diagonalization
method to bring the matrix into a ﬁnal diagonal form.
Each cycle of the QR diagonalization is implemented as
a series of n Jacobi transformations and brings the ﬁnal

25

oﬀ-diagonal entries closer to zero. The cycle must then be
run multiple times until the oﬀ-diagonal entries are below
an acceptable level. As before, our routine keeps track of
the product of the transformations in order to obtain the
eigenvectors as well as the eigenvalues. Our code is again
based on the description in Numerical Recipes [26], and
again has modiﬁcations to allow for complex numbers
and parallelization using OpenMP. We performed several
checks of this code as well, including testing whether the
ﬁnal unitary transformation obtained from both routines
actually diagonalizes the original matrix and gives the
eigenvalues obtained by the code.

Appendix C: Dependence of Vacuum Energy on λ

and ∆p



In this appendix, we would like to give a very rough
understanding of the vacuum energy dependence on ∆p
and λ in Eqs. (23) and (24). The Hamiltonian from
Eq. (10) has the following matrix form when the ba-
sis states (other than the single-particle basis state) are
given in Table I

 .
the matrix, the second is in (cid:80) 1/ω which grows larger

(C1)
The dependence on λ is all explicitly given in the Hamil-
tonian. The dependence on ∆p, on the other hand, comes
in three forms. The ﬁrst is in the explicit dependence in

with decreasing ∆p, and the third is in the size of the
matrix which also grows larger with decreasing ∆p. In
order to understand the vacuum energy’s dependence on
∆p, all three of these sources are important. Although
we can not derive a comprehensive formula showing the
dependence of the vacuum energy on both ∆p and λ,
we can give an argument showing where some of that
dependence comes from.

We begin by studying the eﬀect of ∆p on (cid:80) 1/ω. In

addition to ∆p, this sum also depends on m and the
cutoﬀ momentum pcut. For a given value of m and pcut,
the value of ∆p determines the number of terms in the
sum. For example, if ∆p = pcut, there are three terms in
the sum, but if ∆p = pcut/2, there are ﬁve terms, and so
on. In general, when ∆p (cid:28) pcut, we ﬁnd that the number
of terms in the sum grows as 1/∆p.
If ∆p is halved,
then the number of terms doubles. Furthermore, when
∆p (cid:28) pcut, each term is similar in size to its neighbors,

so that(cid:80) 1/ω grows like 1/∆p. Taken together, we ﬁnd

(cid:88) 1

=

f (m, pcut)

∆p

,

(C2)

ω

where f (1GeV, 10GeV ) = 6 for the reference parameters
given in Eq. (19). With this relation, we can see that the

1/∆p in(cid:80) 1/ω cancels the ∆p in the numerator of many

Hamiltonian matrix elements. Plugging this in, we have

where N is the size of the matrix (the number of rows).
Going back to the matrix in Eq. (C4), we ﬁnd

Although this form does not take into account the full
explicit dependence on ∆p in the Hamiltonian(and some
dependence on λ is dropped when ∆p is taken to zero
as well), it does include the dependence on ∆p in both

(cid:80) 1/ω and in the size of the matrix. Notwithstanding

the neglected dependence on ∆p and λ, this result does
have the right form. We ﬁnd that Evac ∼ 1/∆p as in
Eq. (23) and Evac ∼ λ2 as in Eq. (24).

We also see from Eq. (12) that the single particle en-

scribed in Subsec. III A, but depends linearly on λ as
