The electrodynamics of topological insulators (TIs) is described by modiﬁed Maxwell’s equations,
which contain additional terms that couple an electric ﬁeld to a magnetization and a magnetic ﬁeld
to a polarization of the medium, such that the coupling coeﬃcient is quantized in odd multiples of
e2/2hc per surface. Here, we report on the observation of this so-called topological magnetoelectric
(TME) eﬀect. We use monochromatic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy of TI structures equipped with
a semi-transparent gate to selectively address surface states. In high external magnetic ﬁelds, we
observe a universal Faraday rotation angle equal to the ﬁne structure constant α = e2/c when a
linearly polarized THz radiation of a certain frequency passes through the two surfaces of a strained
HgTe 3D TI. These experiments give insight into axion electrodynamics of TIs and may potentially
be used for a metrological deﬁnition of the three basic physical constants.

Maxwell’s equations are in the foundation of mod-
ern optical and electrical technologies. In oder to apply
Maxwell’s equations in conventional matter, it is neces-
sary to specify constituent relations, describing the po-
larization Pc(E) and magnetization Mc(B) as a function
of the applied electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively.
Soon after the theoretical prediction [1–3] and experi-
mental discovery of 2D and 3D TIs [4, 5], it has been rec-
ognized that the constituent relations in this new phase
of quantum matter contain additional cross-terms Pt(B)
and Mt(E) [6]

Here, N is an integer, and α ≈ 1/137 is the ﬁne structure
constant. Intriguing consequences of Eq. (1) are the uni-
versal Faraday rotation angle |θF| = α, when a linearly
polarized electromagnetic radiation passes through the
top and bottom topological surfaces [6, 7], and magnetic
monopole images, induced by electrical charges in prox-
imity to a topological surface [8]. However, experimental
veriﬁcation of these TME eﬀects has been lacking.

As the modiﬁed Maxwell’s equations describing elec-
trodynamics of TIs are applicable in the low-energy limit,
optical experiments should be performed at THz or sub-
THz frequencies [9–12]. In real samples, the TME may
be screened by nontopological contributions [13–15]. In
fact, quantized Faraday rotation has been detected in 2D
electron gas [16] and graphene [17] in the quantum Hall
eﬀect (QHE) regime, but the observed values are not fun-
damental.

We report on the observation of the universal Fara-
day rotation angle equal to the ﬁne structure constant α.
Strained HgTe layers grown on CdTe, that are investi-
gated in the present work, are shown to be a 3D TI [18]
with surface-dominated charge transport [19]. In oder to
eliminate the material details, we perform measurements
under constructive interference conditions, such that the
transmission through the CdTe substrate is approaching
100% [20].

The strained HgTe ﬁlm is a 58 nm thick HgTe layer
embedded between two Cd0.7Hg0.3Te layers (Fig. 1a).
The Cd0.7Hg0.3Te layers have a thickness of 51 nm (lower
layer) and 11 nm (top/cap layer), respectively. The pur-
pose of these layers is to provide the identical crystalline
interface for top and bottom surface of the HgTe ﬁlms as
well as to protect the HgTe from oxidization and adsorp-
tion. This leads to an increase in carrier mobility with
a simultaneous decrease in carrier density compared to
uncaped samples [18]. The transport characterization
on a standard Hall bar sample shows a carrier density
at 0 V gate of 1.7 × 1011 cm−2 and a carrier mobility of
2.2× 105 cm2V−1s−1. The optical measurements are car-
ried out on a sample ﬁtted with a 110 nm thick multilayer
insulator of SiO2/Si3N4 and a 4 nm thick Ru ﬁlm. The
Ru ﬁlm (oxidized in the air) is used as a semitransparent
top gate electrode [21].

The transmittance experiments at THz frequencies
(0.1 THz < ν < 1 THz) are carried out in a Mach-
Zehnder interferometer arrangement [22, 23], allowing
measurement of the amplitude and the phase shift of the
electromagnetic radiation in a geometry with controlled
polarization (Fig. 1a). The monochromatic THz radia-
tion is provided by a backward-wave oscillator (BWO).
The THz power on the sample is in between 10 µW and

FIG. 1: THz magnetooptics of a strained HgTe 3D TI. a, A scheme of the experimental setup (only one arm of the Mach-
Zehnder interferometer is shown). The strained HgTe layer, which is a 3D TI, is sandwiched between (Cd,Hg)Te protecting
layers. The top-gate electrode, consisting of a SiO2/Si3N4 multilayer insulator and a thin conducting Ru ﬁlm, is semitransparent
at THz frequencies. The THz radiation (ν = 0.35 THz) is linearly polarized, and the Faraday rotation (θF ) and ellipticity (ηF )
are measured as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld B for diﬀerent gate voltages UG. b, c, Transmission spectra in the parallel |tp|
and crossed |tc| polarizer conﬁgurations, respectively. The gate voltage is color-coded, and the experimental curves are shifted

extra resonances with opposite phase to that of the e-CR as discussed in the text.

100 µW with the focal spot of 0.2 cm2. Using wire grid
polarizers, the complex transmission coeﬃcient t = |t|eiφ
is obtained both in parallel tp (Fig. 1b) and cross tc
(Fig. 1c) polarization geometries, providing full infor-
mation about the transmitted light. External magnetic
ﬁelds B (cid:54) 7 T are applied using a split-coil superconduct-
ing magnet. The experiments are carried out in Faraday
geometry, i.e with B applied parallel to the propagation
direction of the THz radiation. The ac conductivity ten-
sor ˆσ(ω) at THz angular frequency ω = 2πν is obtained
from the experimental data by inverting the Berreman
equations [24] for the complex transmission coeﬃcient
through a thin conducting ﬁlm on an insulating sub-
strate.

In general case, the light propagating along the z di-
rection can be characterized by the orthogonal x and y
components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which
can be written in the form of a 4D vector V. The in-
terconnection between vectors V1 and V2, correspond-
ing to diﬀerent points in space separated by a distance
(cid:96), is given by V1 = ˆM ((cid:96))V2. Here, ˆM ((cid:96)) is a 4 × 4
transfer matrix. For an insulating substrate of thickness
√
(cid:96) and dielectric constant ε, this is the identity matrix
ˆMCdTe((cid:96)) = I provided (cid:96)
ε ν/c is an integer. We ﬁnd
in a separate experiment on a bare CdTe substrate that
this condition is fulﬁlled for ν ≈ 0.35 THz. Therefore, all

the measurements presented here are performed at this
frequency to eliminate any contribution to the Faraday
signal from the substrate. The corresponding photon en-
ergy of 1.4 meV is much smaller than the energy gap in
strained HgTe (above 10 meV) [18], and Eqs. (1) are a
good approximation.
For normal incidence, the ﬁelds across the conducting
interface are connected by the Maxwell equation ∇×H =
ˆσE. Here, the e−iωt time dependence is assumed for all
ﬁelds. As the wavelength of 856 µm for ν = 0.35 THz is
much larger than the HgTe layer thickness, we use the
limit of thin ﬁlm, and the corresponding transfer matrix
ˆMHgTe(ˆσ) is determined by the diagonal (σxx) and Hall
(σxy) components of the conductivity tensor ˆσ. Within
the Drude-like model, these components for one type of
charge carriers can be written in the form [14, 25]

Here, Ωc is the cyclotron resonance (CR) frequency, σ0

classical conductors, the CR frequency is written as Ωc =

parabolic approximation.

To understand the origin of the experimentally ob-
served resonances, we analyze the band structure of
tensile strained Cd0.7Hg0.3Te / HgTe layer as shown in
Fig. 2a.
It is obtained similar to Ref. [19] within the
tight binding approximation of the 6 × 6 - Kane Hamil-
tonian [26, 27]. Due to reduced point symmetry at the
boundary between the Cd0.7Hg0.3Te and HgTe layers, an
additional interface potential is allowed in the Hamilto-
nian [28]. This potential is used to shift the Dirac point
closer to the valence band edge, so that the tight binding
results are in good agreement with recent ARPES exper-
iments [18, 29] and ab-initio calculations [30] on HgTe.
The Dirac-like surface states are located in the band gap
between the light-hole (conduction) and heavy hole (va-
lence) subbands (Fig. 2a). The camel back of the heavy
hole band originates from coupling of this band to the
electron-like valence band and is therefore a hallmark of
the inverted band structure of HgTe. In accordance with
previous transport data, the chemical potential crosses
the topological surface states for a large range of gate
voltages [19]. The total electron density in Fig. 2a is
n ≈ 2 × 1011 cm−2, representing the experimental situa-
tion at UG = 1.9 V. For simplicity, we assume here the
same density at the top and bottom surfaces. Using the
general formula for a classical cyclotron resonance [31]
∂E(k)
Ωc = 2πeB2
∂A , where E(k) is the energy dispersion, B
is the magnetic ﬁeld, and A is the area enclosed by the
wave vector k, we calculate for the topological surface
state Ωce/B ≈ 35 cm−1/T.

Experimentally, simultaneous ﬁt of the real and imag-
inary parts of tp and tc allows the extraction of all trans-
port characteristics, i.e., conductivity, charge carrier den-
sity, scattering time and CR frequency [20]. The inset
of Fig. 2b shows experimentally determined electron CR
as a function of gate voltage, which perfectly agrees with
the theoretical value for the topological Dirac-like surface
states. Since only surface states are observed in trans-
port experiments on the similar structures [19], a possible
explanation of the appearance of additional resonances is
interband Landau level transitions between heavy hole-
like (HH) bulk bands and topological surface states. Such
transitions are generally allowed as can be shown using
the Kubo formula. Another possibility would be ther-
mally activated transport between the camel back of the
HH bulk band and the surface states. This is generally
possible since the THz ﬁeld may well induce heating of
the carriers, resulting in a higher eﬀective temperature
compared to that of the lattice. The heating of the sys-
tem would be consistent with the eﬀective temperature
of the surface states carriers T = 25 K, as shown later in
Fig. 3.

From the obtained scattering time and the CR po-
sitions in the magnetooptical spectra of Figs. 1b and
1c, one can calculate the mobility µ = τ Ωc/B. The
surface states demonstrate high mobility µe = 1.8 ×
105 cm2V−1s−1, which agrees with the dc transport data.

values are given relative to the impedance of free space Z0 =
1/c0 ≈ 377 Ohm. The inset shows the e-CR in terms of
Ωce/B as a function of the gate voltage UG.

The total transfer matrix ˆM = ˆMCdTe ˆMHgTe relates
vectors V on both sides of the sample and hence con-
tains full information about the transmission and reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcients. Thus, when ˆMCdTe = I, the inﬂuence
of the substrate is minimized, and the THz response is
dominated by the ac transport properties of the HgTe
layer, in accord with Eqs. (2) and (3). The calculation of
the complex transmission coeﬃcients tp and tc based on
the transfer matrix formalism as well as the exact form
of the transfer matrices are presented in Methods.

Magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the THz transmission is
dominated by a sharp CR of surface electrons (e) Ωce at
Be = 0.4 T (Figs. 1b and 1c). Below we demonstrate
their Dirac-like character and that they are responsible
for the universal Faraday rotation. Remarkably, the ob-
servation of the CR both in tp and tc indicates a high
purity of our HgTe layer. The scattering time is signif-
icantly longer than the inverse THz frequency ωτ (cid:29) 1,
and according to Eqs. (2) and (3) the ac conductivity re-
veals a resonance-like behavior σxx, σxy ∝ 1/(Ω2
ce − ω2).
Further features are broad resonances at Bs1 = 3.7 T
and at Bs2 = 2.2 T indicated in Fig. 1 as s1 and s2,
respectively. The phase of the corresponding THz trans-
mission coeﬃcient φc in the vicinity of these resonances
has the opposite sign with respect to that of the e-CR.
Remarkably, the s1 and s2 resonances disappear with
applying positive gate voltage (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2b). We
associate them with either interband Landau level tran-
sitions or thermally activated states as discussed below.

cal experiments. As mentioned above, the overall be-
haviour of σxy(ω) is provided by the classical curve of
Eq. (3), and the real part of σxy can be approximated as
ce − ω2)τ ], which in the limit Ωce (cid:29) ω
σxy(ω) ≈ σ0Ωc/[(Ω2
reduces to the expression σxy = ne/B, being a multiple
of e2/h. In low magnetic ﬁelds, the CR frequency Ωce
becomes comparable to the THz frequency ω, destroying
the regularities in σxy(ω).

Since in strained HgTe the Fermi level lies in the bulk
band gap (see Fig. 2a and Ref. 19), we attribute the
observed THz QHE to the formation of the 2D Landau
levels at the top and bottom surfaces of the HgTe layer
(Fig. 1a). This interpretation is further substantiated by
our theoretical analysis of the ac quantum Hall conduc-
tivity σxy(ω) calculated from the Kubo formula for both
top and bottom surface states within the Dirac model
[14, 33].

Our two-surface Dirac model describes well the sur-
face carrier CR (the inset of Fig. 3). The lengths of
the theoretical Hall plateaus in the high magnetic ﬁeld
region (Fig. 3) correlate correctly with the positions of
the extrema in the derivative ∂σxy/∂B. However, the
model predicts much sharper transitions between the
QHE plateaus, as observed in the experiment. One of
two possible explanations is the heating of the surface
carriers by the THz ﬁeld, resulting in a higher eﬀective
temperature compared to that of the lattice. Such a heat-
ing can occur due to ineﬃcient energy relaxation in the
electronic system through the emission of LO phonons at
low temperatures [34]. The best ﬁt of our experimental
data is obtained with T = 25 K (Fig. 3). Another ex-
planation is based on spatial ﬂuctuations of the surface
carrier densities, which are likely to occur in our samples
due to their large lateral sizes compared to the typical
Hall bars used in the dc measurements. The experimen-
tal data of Fig. 3 can alternatively be well ﬁtted assuming
cold carriers (T = 1.7 K) with density ﬂuctuations within
10% relative to their nominal values (Fig. 3). As the ﬁts
are nearly indistinguishable, we cannot quantitatively de-
termine the contributions of both mechanisms leading to
the smearing of the THz QHE plateaus.

The stronger the ﬁeld, the closer the Hall conductivity
to the quantized values expected for a two-surface Dirac

where Na,b are the integer numbers of the highest oc-

with na,b being the corresponding carrier densities (Φ0 =

ing the cyclotron resonance, the Hall conductivity de-
viates from the quantized values in Eq. (4) due to the
predominance of the intraband transitions between the
Landau levels. From the ﬁtting procedure, we extract
the nominal carrier densities na = 0.92 × 1011 cm−2

the THz Hall conductivity σxy in units of e2/h, obtained at
UG = 1.9 V. The vertical solid and dashed lines indicate the
positions of the Hall plateaus in two surfaces (Na and Nb),
estimated from the extrema in ∂σxy/∂B (upper panel). Theo-
retical calculations represented by the thin line are performed
as explained in the text. Inset presents the same experimen-
tal and theoretical curves in the whole magnetic ﬁeld range,
including the surface carrier CR at 0.4 T.

Since the e-CR and s1,s2-resonances occur at diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁelds, their contributions to the ac transport
can be clearly separated, as presented in Fig. 2b. The
striking feature of this plot is that the ac conductivity of
the surface states dominates at large gate voltages. In
what follows, we concentrate therefore on UG > 1.0 V,
while remaining weak contribution from the interband
Landau-level transitions/thermally activated transitions
are subtracted as explained in Methods.

Figure 3 demonstrates the real part of the Hall con-
ductivity σxy. The overall behavior is provided by the
high-ﬁeld wing of the classical Drude model, i.e., Eq. (3),
resulting in a rapid suppression of σxy with growing mag-
netic ﬁeld. In addition to the classical behaviour, regular
oscillations in ∂σxy/∂B can be recognized, which are lin-
ear in inverse magnetic ﬁeld. The slope of the linear be-
havior changes with gate voltage, reﬂecting gate depen-
dence of the electron density in one of the two surfaces
[11]. These QHE oscillations extrapolate to Na = 1/2
value for large magnetic ﬁelds, demonstrating Dirac char-
acter of the surface electrons [32]. While the oscillations
of ∂σxy/∂B in Fig. 3 are not clearly resolved, the visibil-
ity can be signiﬁcantly improved by inserting the sample
in a Fabry-P´erot resonator, as we have previously demon-
strated for a similar structure [11].

In magnetic ﬁelds above 5 T, the Hall conductivity
clearly shows a plateau close to σxy = e2/h, correspond-
ing to a value (1/2)e2/h per surface (Fig. 3). Another
plateau close to 3e2/h is also recognizable at a mag-
netic ﬁeld of 3 T. The steps in σxy loose their regu-
larity in lower magnetic ﬁelds, as can be qualitatively
explained by a ﬁnite THz frequency ω in magnetoopti-

while the TME dominates, the interaction of TIs with
THz radiation is not a completely dissipationless pro-
cess in our samples. Remarkably, the universal value of
the Faraday angle remains robust against the gate volt-
age. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4c, where |θF| ≈ α for
0.7 V < UG < 1.9 V.

The observed terahertz Faraday rotation equal to the
ﬁne structure constant α = 2πe2/hc is a direct conse-
quence of the topological magnetoelectric eﬀect, conﬁrm-
ing axion electrodynamics of 3D topological insulators.
We use monochromatic terahertz spectroscopy, providing
complete amplitude and phase reconstruction, which can
be applied to investigate topological phenomena in vari-
ous systems, including graphene, 2D electron gas, layered
superconductors and recently experimentally discovered
Weyl semimetals [35]. Picoradian angle resolution can
be achieved using a balanced detection scheme [36], and
the universal Faraday rotation in combination with the
magnetic ﬂux quantum Φ0 = h/|e| and the conductivity
quantum G0 = e2/h are suggested [13] to use for a metro-
logical deﬁnition of the three basic physical constants, e,
h, and c.

Having established that the THz response of the topo-
logical surface states in high magnetic ﬁelds B > 5 T
is determined by the conductivity quantum G0 = e2/h
(Na = Nb = 0), we turn to the central result of this work,
the THz Faraday eﬀect. Owing to the TME of Eq. (1),
an oscillating electric Exe−iωt (magnetic Hye−iωt) ﬁeld
of the linearly polarized THz radiation induces in a 3D
TI an oscillating magnetic αHxe−iωt (electric αEye−iωt)
ﬁeld. The generated in such a way secondary THz radi-
ation is polarized perpendicular to the primary polariza-
tion and its amplitude is α times smaller. This can be
viewed as a rotation of the initial polarization by an angle
|θF| = arctan α ≈ 7.3 × 10−3 rad. Indeed, Fig. 4a clearly
demonstrates that the Faraday angle in high magnetic
ﬁelds is close to this fundamental value.

We rigorously characterize the THz Faraday eﬀect, and
the Faraday ellipticity ηF is shown in Fig. 4b. It is rel-
atively small |ηF| < |θF| in high magnetic ﬁelds, but
does not reach zero. This observation indicates that

complex conductivity tensor of the material. In the limit
of thin ﬁlm the transfer matrix reads

space. We note that matrices ˆMCdTe and ˆMHgTe as given
in Eqs. (6)-(7) are fully equivalent to well known trans-
mission and reﬂection expressions for a bare substrate
and a thin ﬁlm, respectively.

The total transfer matrix ˆM = ˆMCdTe ˆMHgTe relates
vectors V in the air on both sides of the sample and con-
tains full information about transmission and reﬂection
coeﬃcients. In order to calculate them, it is more conve-
nient to change the basis. In the new basis, the ﬁrst com-
ponent of the vector V is the amplitude of the linearly
polarized wave (Ex) propagating in positive direction,
the second is that of the wave with the same polariza-
tion propagating in negative direction, the third and the
fourth components are the same but for two waves with
the orthogonal linear polarization (Ey). The propagation
matrix in the new basis is ˆM(cid:48) = ˆV −1 ˆM ˆV , with the basis
transformation matrix being

Here, the tp and tc denote the complex transmittance
amplitudes within parallel and crossed polarizers, respec-
tively. The same conventions for reﬂectance are given by
rp and rc. Eq. (9) can be inverted analytically to obtain
the complex conductivity matrix from the transmission
data.

The Faraday rotation θ and Faraday ellipticity η can
be directly obtained from the transmission amplitudes
|tp|, |tc| and phases φp, φc as

tan(2θ) =

sin(2η) =

2|tp||tc| cos(φp − φc)

|tp|2 − |tc|2

2|tp||tc| sin(φp − φc)

Subtraction of a background contribution

We start from the directly measured spectra of Fara-
day rotation and ellipticity. We note, that related data on
complex transmission tc and tp are known as well. Using
the expression for the transmission of a ﬁlm on a sub-
strate, the Faraday rotation and ellipticity are directly
inverted to obtain complex conductivities σxx and σxy.
In addition, from the ﬁts of the transmission data, the
parameters of all charge carriers are obtained. In the ap-
proximation of independent carriers, their conductivities
are additive, and a weak background contribution asso-
ciated with the s-resonances can be directly subtracted
from σxx and σxy. Finally, the corrected conductivity
data are used to calculate the Faraday rotation and el-
lipticity from electron-like surface states.
