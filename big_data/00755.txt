(Dated: February 1, 2016)

The zero temperature phase diagram of the mono-axial chiral helimagnet in the magnetic ﬁeld
plane formed by the components parallel and perpendicular to the helical axis is thoroughly analyzed.
The nature of the transition to the commensurate state depends on the angle between the ﬁeld and
the helical axis. For ﬁeld directions close to the directions parallel or perpendicular to the helical
axis the transition is continuous, while for intermediate angles the transition is discontinuous and
the incommensurate and commensurate states coexist on the transition line. The continuous and
discontinuous transition lines are separated by two tricritical points with speciﬁc singular behaviour.
The location of the continuous and discontinuous lines and of the tricritical points depend strongly
on the easy-plane anisotropy, the eﬀect of which is analyzed. For large anisotropy the conical
approximation locates the transition line very accurately, although it does not predict the continuous
transitions nor the tricitical behaviour. It is shown that for large anisotropy, as in CrNb3S6, the form
of the transition line is universal, that is, independent of the sample, and obeys a simple equation.
The position of the tricritical points, which is not universal, is theoretically estimated for a sample
of CrNb3S6.

INTRODUCTION

For example,

Chiral magnets are very promising ingredients for spin-
tronic based devices since they support peculiar magnetic
textures that aﬀect the charge and spin transport proper-
ties in diﬀerent ways1. As these magnetic textures can be
deeply altered by magnetic ﬁelds, the transport proper-
ties can be magnetically controlled, and thus they might
be used as functional components of magnetic devices2,3.
in the mono-axial chiral helimagnet,
an instance of which is CrNb3S6,
the competition
between the ferromagnetic (FM) and Dzyaloshinskii–
Moriya (DM) interactions leads to an incommensurate
magnetic helix propagating with period L0 along a crys-
tallographic axis, which will be called here the DM axis.
The eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld on the helical magnetic
ordering is an old topic and was discussed for instance in
Ref. 4. In the case of mono-axial DM interactions, ap-
plication of a magnetic ﬁeld deforms the helix in a way
which depends on the ﬁeld direction. If the ﬁeld is par-
allel to the DM axis, a conical helix is formed, with the
spins tilted by a constant angle towards the DM axis,
while revolving round it with a period L0 independent of
the magnetic ﬁeld. If, on the other hand, the magnetic
ﬁeld is perpendicular to the DM axis, the spins remain
perpendicular to the DM axis but tend to be aligned
with the magnetic ﬁeld. The spins rotate slowly about
the DM axis in the regions where they are nearly paral-
lel to the magnetic ﬁeld, and the rotation becomes faster
as the spin direction separates from the ﬁeld direction.
As the ﬁeld increases, the regions where the spins ro-

tate slowly become very wide and the regions where the
spins rotate fast become very narrow, and a Chiral Soli-
ton Lattice (CSL) is formed1,5–7. This CSL, which is re-
8, supports dynamic modes like coher-
alised in CrNb3S6
ent sliding9 and gives rise to exciting phenomena as spin
motive forces10 and tuneable magnetoresistence11–14.

If the applied ﬁeld is strong enough, the incommensu-
rate chiral helicoid is transformed in a commensurate FM
state, called the forced ferromagnetic (FFM) state. Chi-
ral and incommensurate (IC) to commensurate (C) tran-
sitions, which are universal and appear in many branches
of physics, take place in these systems. The nature of the
IC-C transition and its driving mechanism depend on the
angle α between the ﬁeld and the DM axis. If a ﬁeld par-
allel to the DM axis increases, the cone on which the
spins lie becomes narrower, but the helix period L0 re-
mains constant. At a certain critical ﬁeld the cone closes
completely and the FFM state is reached continuously.
On the other hand, the eﬀect of increasing a ﬁeld perpen-
dicular to the DM axis is to increase the period of the
CSL, so that the FFM state is reached continuously at a
critical ﬁeld at which the period L of the CSL diverges1.
Thus, in the two limiting cases of magnetic ﬁeld paral-
lel and perpendicular to the DM axis the FFM state is
reached via two very diﬀerent mechanisms. On the other
hand, even if these systems have been extensively stud-
ied, the nature of the transition to the FFM has not been
elucidated yet when α is continuously varied between the
limiting cases 0 and π/2.

A theoretical attempt has been made recently based
on an approximation which makes the model equations

easily solvable15. As we shall show in section VI the
approximation gives the transition line very accurately
when the easy-plane anisotropy is large, as in the case
of CrNb3S6. However, the nature of the transition, and
in particular its continuity or discontinuity, is not well
described within this approximation.
In this work we
address the important question of the phase diagram of
the mono-axial chiral helimagnet in the magnetic ﬁeld
plane by solving the model without any uncontrolled ap-
proximation, and the results which come out are in some
respects rather diﬀerent from those of reference 15.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section II the
model is described and the method of solution is out-
lined. Sec. III is devoted to analyze the results for the
phase diagram. In Sec. IV the nature of the singularities
that appear on the transition line is studied. The eﬀect
of easy-plane anisotropy is discussed in Sec. V. A com-
parison with approximate solutions, namely the conical
approximation of Ref. 15 and the decoupling approxima-
tion developed in this work, is presented in Sec. VI, where
it is also shown that the form of the phase transition
line is universal when the magnitude of the anisotropy
is large. Sec. VII deals with the application of the re-
sults to CrNb3S6. And some conclusions are gathered in
Sec. VIII. Finally, details on the numerical methods are
given in the appendix.

II. MODEL AND METHOD OF SOLUTION

To settle the question raised in the introduction, we
studied the zero temperature ground state of a classical
spin system with FM isotropic exchange, mono-axial DM
interactions, and single-ion easy-plane anisotropy, in the
presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld.

At zero temperature the spins lying on the planes per-
pendicular to the DM axis are FM arranged. The com-
petition between the DM and FM interaction gives rise
to a helicoidal spin structure along the DM axis and the
model becomes eﬀectively one dimensional. The classical
eﬀective 1D hamiltonian in the continuum limit reads:

H =Z Λ

0

dz(cid:20) 1

2

ˆn′2 − q0 ˆz · (ˆn × ˆn′) + γn2

z − ~β · ˆn(cid:21)

(1)

where z labels the coordinate along the DM axis ˆz, the
prime stands for the derivative with respect to z, ˆn is
a unit vector in the direction of the spin ~S, so that
~S = S ˆn, with S being the spin modulus, and Λ is the
system length along the DM axis, which is assumed to
be large. The constants entering Eq. (1) are related to
the interaction strengths as follows:
let J and D stand
for the strengths of the FM and DM interactions, respec-
tively, K for the strength of the single-ion anisotropy in-
teraction, and a for the underlying lattice parameter; the
energy H is measured in units of JS2/a, and therefore
q0 = D/Ja, γ = K/Ja2, and ~β = (gµB/JSa2) ~H, where
~H is the applied magnetic ﬁeld. The parallel magnetic

βx = 0.17, with transition point on DTL. Bottom left: βx =

with the transition point on CTL2. In each case the diﬀerent
curves correspond to diﬀerent values of βz. The green and
blue axis represent respectively the DM axis and the direction
of the FFM state at the transition point.

ﬁeld is thus proportional to βz and, without any loss, we
can take the perpendicular ﬁeld proportional to βx and
set βy = 0. The parameter q0 is the helix pitch at zero
magnetic ﬁeld, so that its period is L0 = 2π/q0. We set
q0 = 1 in the computations, what merely amounts to set
the unit length equal to L0/2π.

At zero temperature the classical ground state is given
by the minimum of the hamiltonian (1), which is a solu-
tion of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations.
The inﬁnitely many solutions are characterized by the
boundary conditions (BC). On physical grounds, we ex-
pect a periodic ground state for an inﬁnite system. Then,
if L is the period, the appropriate BC is ˆn(0) = ˆn(L).
This however does not guarantee periodicity because, as
the EL equations are second order, periodicity requires
also the equality of the ﬁrst derivatives,

ˆn′(0) = ˆn′(L) ,

(2)

a condition which cannot be generally imposed since
the associated boundary value problem (BVP) would be
overdetermined. Hence, the value of the spin at the
boundaries, ˆn(0), has to be tuned in order to obtain pe-
riodicity with period L. This can in principle be done
as we have the two degrees of freedom associated to ˆn(0)
and only two of the three Eqs. (2) are independent, due
to the constraint ˆn(z) · ˆn′(z) = 0. The periodic solutions

3

are thus solely characterized by the period L. As the
solution of a BVP is not necessarily unique, there might
be several periodic solutions associated to a given L. We
do not expect this on physical grounds, and indeed we
never found more than one solution for the BVP in the
course of our numerical computations. The equilibrium
period is obtained by minimization of the energy density,
E = H/Λ, which for a periodic state is given by

E = (1/L)Z L

0

h(z)dz ,

(3)

where h(z) is the integrand entering Eq. (1).

The approach proposed here is a generalisation of the
well known procedure of expanding the magnetisation
in harmonic modes and selecting the mode which min-
imises the free energy. The present problem, however,
is highly non-linear and all modes contribute to the so-
lution, which has to be found by numerical techniques.
Dzyaloshinskii5,6 solved analytically the case of a purely
perpendicular ﬁeld using a similar approach: he got the

general solution of the diﬀerential equations and mini-
mized the free energy in terms of the non-trivial inte-
gration constant, the jacobian elliptic modulus, which is
directly related to the period of the IC structure.

The form of the EL equations depends on the coor-
dinate system chosen to parametrize ˆn. As the whole
sphere cannot be smoothly parametrized with a single co-
ordinate set, we used two diﬀerent coordinate sets: a) co-
ordinate set I, (ξ, ϕ), with ξ ∈ (−∞, ∞), and ϕ ∈ [0, 2π],

so that ˆn = (cos ϕ, sin ϕ, ξ)/ρ, where ρ = p1 + ξ2; and

b) coordinate set II, (ϑ, φ), with ϑ ∈ [0, π] and φ ∈ [0, 2π],
so that ˆn = (sin ϑ sin φ, cos ϑ, sin ϑ cos φ). Coordinate set
I is closely related to the polar coordinate set with polar
axis along the DM axis (ˆz) and the polar angle θ related
to ξ by cot θ = ξ. This coordinate set is singular on ±ˆz,
where ξ diverges. Coordinate set II is a polar coordinate
system with polar axis along ˆy, and therefore is singular
at ±ˆy, where sin ϑ = 0. The EL equations and the BC
read in coordinate set I

ξ′′ − 2ξξ′2/ρ2 + (ϕ′2 − 2q0ϕ′)ξ − 2γξ − βxρξ cos ϕ + βzρ = 0 ,
ϕ′′ − 2(ϕ′ − q0)ξξ′/ρ2 − βxρ sin ϕ = 0 ,
ϕ(0) = 0,

ξ(0) = ξ(L) = ξ0 ;

ϕ(L) = 2π,

and in coordinate set II

ϑ′′ − sin ϑ cos ϑ φ′2 + 2q0 sin2 ϑ cos φ φ′ − 2γ sin ϑ cos ϑ cos2 φ + βx cos ϑ sin φ + βz cos ϑ cos φ = 0 ,
sin2 ϑ φ′′ + sin ϑ cos ϑ ϑ′φ′ − 2q0 sin2 ϑ cos φ ϑ′ + 2γ sin2 ϑ sin φ cos φ + βx sin ϑ cos φ − βz sin ϑ sin φ = 0 ,
ϑ(0) = ϑ(L) = π/2 ,

φ(0) = φ(L) = φ0 .

As ˆn contains two degrees of freedom and the dif-
ferential equations are second order, the general solu-
tion contains four independent constants. The condition
ˆn(0) = ˆn(L) removes two of them. We used translational
invariance to eliminate one more, so that it remains ei-
ther ξ0 or φ0 as tuneable parameter. The reason is that
the conﬁguration that minimizes the energy will have at
least one point with the spin lying on the plane deter-
mined by the DM axis (ˆz) and the magnetic ﬁeld (ˆx).
Using translational symmetry we can choose this point
as z = 0, so that in coordinate set I we have ϕ(0) = 0
and in coordinate set II ϑ(0) = π/2.

The ground state (or equilibrium) conﬁguration ˆn(z)
with z ∈ [0, L] can be visualized as a closed path on the
unit sphere, with the coordinate z acting as the param-
eter of the curve. Fig. 1 displays such paths, given by
the red trajectories, in diﬀerent situations. The green
axis represents the DM axis (ˆz) and the FFM state at
the transition point is represented by the blue axis. Co-
ordinate set I and its associated BC is appropriate when
the path does encircle the DM axis; coordinate set II is
suitable when the paths are not too close to ˆy, which lies

on the equatorial plane. As already mentioned, notice
that the BC (4c) forces the path to encircle the DM axis.
When the values of the magnetic ﬁeld are such that the
equilibrium state is represented by one path which does
not encircle the DM axis, as in the top panels of Fig. 1,
the BVP (4) has no solution, and we are forced to use
coordinate set II and solve (5). On the other hand, on a
wide part of the phase diagram both coordinate sets can
be used. In such cases, we solved both BVPs and got the
same solution ˆn(z) within the tiny numerical uncertain-
ties (see the appendix, where details on the numerical
procedures are given).

III. PHASE DIAGRAM

To obtain a phase diagram we compare the energies
of the IC state, EIC, which is computed numerically fol-
lowing the lines outlined in the previous section, and of
the FFM state, EFFM, for which ϕ = 0 and the constant

For small ~β, EFFM > EIC and the IC state is the ground
state. The transition to the FFM state takes place when
EFFM = EIC, and is continuous if at this point the IC state
merges smoothly with the FFM. Otherwise the transi-
tion is discontinuous. The IC state can be visualized as
a closed curve on the unit sphere while the FFM state
is represented by a single point (Fig. 1). As discussed
in the introduction, there are two mechanisms by which
the IC state can be continuously transformed into the
FFM state. The ﬁrst possibility is displayed in the top
left panel of Fig. 1: as the magnetic ﬁeld is tuned to its
critical value the IC curve reduces its size until it col-
lapses onto the FFM state. In this case a helical conical
state which, in the vicinity of the transition point, re-
volves around the direction of the FFM and not around
the DM axis, becomes completely parallel at the transi-
tion point. The bttom right panel of Fig. 1 illustrates
the second possibility. The length of the IC curve on the
unit sphere remains ﬁnite as the transition point is ap-
proached. Near the transition, the vast majority of the
spins, however, are concentrated on a narrow arc close
to the FFM state and the number of spins lying on the
remaining part of the curve becomes negligible, so that a
CSL is formed. At the transition point the period of the
soliton diverges and therefore its fundamental wavevec-
tor, q = 2π/L, tends to zero.

Fig. 2 displays the phase diagram in the (βx, βz) plane
for γ = 2.584q2
0 (a) and γ = 0 (b). We shall disccuss the
γ = 0 case in section V and here the γ = 2.584q2
0 case,
which is relevant for CrNb3S6 (see section VII). We see
that the transition is continuous in the vicinities of the
βx = 0 and the βz = 0 axes, while it is discontinuous in
the intermediate regime. The behaviour of EFFM − EIC as
a function of βz for ﬁxed βx is illustrated in the top panels

lines. We used OP = 1 − M , where M = |(1/L)R L

of Fig. 3 in three cases, one for each of the three transition
0 ˆndz|
is the magnetization in suitable units, as an “order pa-
rameter” (OP) which vanishes in the FFM phase.
Its
behaviour in each case is displayed in the bottom panels
of Fig. 3.

For conciseness, we shall call the continuous transition
lines which touch the βx = 0 and the βz = 0 axes re-
spectively the continuos transition line 1 (CTL1) and 2
(CTL2), and we shall use DTL for discontinuous transi-
tion line. On the CTL1 the FFM state is reached contin-
uously by the “closing cone” mechanism, as illustrated in
Fig. 1 (top left). The period L remains ﬁnite and close
to L0 at the transition point. On the other hand, on
the CTL2, the period of the IC diverges and the FFM
state is continuously reached by the same mechanism as
in the βz = 0 case. The bottom right panel of Fig. 1 is
an instance of this mechanism.

On the DTL the IC and FFM state become degener-
ate and neither the “cone closes” nor the period diverges.
These situations are illustrated in the top right and bot-
tom left panels of Fig. 1. The OP is discontinuos on this
line. Fig. 4 (left) shows the OP jump along the tran-
sition line, parametrised by βx. Along the DTL the IC
state coexists with the FFM state as they are degenerate
in energy. On each side of the line either the IC or the
FFM state are metastable. This is illustrated in Fig. 4
(right), where the energy diﬀerence is displayed as a func-
tion of q = 2π/L in a case in which the IC state with
q ≈ 0.84 q0 is metastable and the FFM (q = 0) is stable.
Hence, phenomena like phase coexistence, domain for-
mation, and hysteresis are expected in some regions of

The spatial dependence of the ground state as the tran-
sition is approached is shown in Fig. 6, where the carte-
sian components of ˆn are displayed as a function of z/L.
Cartesian components are shown since they are regular
for any ~β. They have been computed from the solutions
obtained either with coordinate set I or II. The left panels
correspond to βx = 0.15 and show ˆn(z) for diﬀerent val-
ues of βz which tend to a transition point on CTL1. We
observe that the variation of ˆn(z) is distributed smoothly
over the whole period for all βz, so that no soliton is
formed. Also, the amplitude of the oscilations decreases
smoothly to zero as the transition point is approached,
attaining continuously the FFM. The right panels corre-
spond βx = 0.55 and the values of βz tend to a transition
point on CTL2. Observe that the variations of ˆn(z) are
gradually concentrated on a narrow section of the period,
and a soliton lattice is formed. It is a relative narrow-
ness: the size of the region where ˆn(z) varies noticeably is
approximately constant, but the period increases as the
transition is approached. It is interesting that the soliton
lattice can be created by increasing the component of the
magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the DM axis, keeping constant

the perpendicular ﬁeld.

IV. SINGULAR BEHAVIOUR ON THE

CONTINUOUS TRANSITION LINES

On the continuous transition lines CTL1 and CTL2
the IC and FFM states merge continuously but, as in
any phase transition, physical observables may present
peculiar singularities. Let us analyze the nature of these
singularities. The OP vanishes linearly as the CTL1
(βx < βt1
x ) is attained from the IC phase (bottom left
pannel of Fig. 3). Thus, no singularity appears on
CTL1. As TC1 is approached, the slope of the OP be-
comes more abrupt and becomes singular at TC1. We
assume that at TC1 the OP vanishes as a power law,
z − βz)n/m, with n and m small integers. The
OP ∼ A(βt1
best ﬁt, which is indeed very good, gives βt1
z ≈ 5.9552506
and n/m = 0.5002 ≈ 1/2.

As CTL2 is attained from the IC phase, the OP van-
ishes more abruptly than a power (bottom right pannel
of Fig. 3). The OP scales with the period as 1/L, so that
the OP singularity is directly related to the L singularity.
For βz = 0 the following scaling law is derived from the
analytically known solution:

(pβxcL + 1) exp(−pβxcL) ∼ (βxc − βx)/8βxc ,

the singularity, does not. Fig. 7 displays an example
of the scaling of L as the transition point (βx = 0.55,
βz = 2.734641) is approached along the line of constant
βz. The parameter A grows as βx decreases and diverges
at the tricritical point TC2. This means the nature of
the singularity changes at the tricritical point. Unfor-
tunately, this new singularity cannot be studied numeri-
cally without further insight.

The scaling of L given by (8) is a general feature of
the formation of the CSL, and it can be used to ﬁt the
experimental results near the transition point for oblique
ﬁelds. The behaviour of the parameter A then can be
used to locate the tricritical point TC2.

V. EFFECT OF THE EASY-PLANE

SINGLE-ION ANIOSTROPY

The easy-plane anisotropy has an important eﬀect on
the phase diagram, as can be seen in Fig. 2b, where the
γ = 0 case is displayed. We see that the CTL2 disap-
pears, the DTL reaches the βz = 0 axis, and only one
tricritical point (TC1) appears. For γ > 0 the phase dia-
gram is qualitatively similar to the case discussed in the
previous sections (γ = 2.584q2
0). The transition lines in
the (βx, βz) plane for diﬀerent values of γ are shown in

respectively decreases and increases. In a tridimensional
parameter space (βx, βz, γ) there is a phase transition
surface divided by two tricritical lines into three sectors,
one in which the transitions are discontinuous and two
in which they are continuous.

Not surprisingly, the easy-plane anisotropy provides
stability to the CSL formed when the ﬁeld is purely per-
pendicular, so that for large γ large parallel ﬁelds are
necessary to modify the behaviour of the CSL and its
transition to the FFM state. The eﬀect of easy-plane
anisotropy is important since low-anisotropy compounds
described by the model studied in this work, as for in-
stance thin ﬁlms of MnSi16, will be characterized by low
values of γ.

The case of easy-axis aniostropy (γ < 0), not ana-
lyzed in this work, is theoretically interesting –and per-
haps also phenomenologically– as peculiar phenomena
may take place in the crossover to Ising-like behaviour
as |γ| increases17.

VI. COMPARISON WITH SIMPLIFYING

APPROXIMATIONS

It is interesting to compare the results obtained here
with those obtained by making approximations which
drastically simplify the mathematical problem. We con-
sider two of such approximations: the conical approxi-
mation of Ref. 15 and the decoupling approximation de-
veloped below.

In the conical approximation the spatial variation of
the spin component parallel to the DM axis, nz, is ne-
glected, and the ground state is obtained by minimizing
the energy density over spin conﬁgurations with constant
nz = cos θ0. The EL equations for the non-constant com-
ponents give a sine-Gordon equation similar to that of
the βz = 0 model with an eﬀective perpendicular ﬁeld

βeﬀ
x = βx/ sin θ0. Then, the ground state has the form15

where

nx(z) = sin θ0 cos ϕ(z),
ny(z) = sin θ0 sin ϕ(z),
nz(z) = cos θ0,

(9)
(10)
(11)

ϕ(z) = −2 am(cid:16)pβx/(κ2 sin θ0)z, κ(cid:17) ,

and am(x, k) is the Jacobi amplitude function with el-
liptic modulus κ. The energy density associated to the
above solution depends on the two parameters cos θ0 and
κ, and reads15

where K(κ) and E(κ) are the complete elliptic integrals
of the ﬁrst and second kind, respectively. The ﬁrst three
terms give the energy of the conical helix with wavevector
q0, while the term proportional to βx is the diﬀerence
between the conical helicoid (12) and the conical helix.
We write the energy in this way for later convenience.

Minimization of (13) with respect to θ0 and κ gives the
phase diagram. The IC-FFM transition is everywhere
discontinuous except at the two end points of the transi-
tion line. Notice that the conical approximation is exact
in the two limiting cases βx = 0 and βz = 0. The good-
ness of the approximation depends on the magnitude of
the easy-plane anisotropy. Fig. 9 displays the phase tran-
sition lines obtained in this work by numerical integration
of the EL equations (EL solution), and in the conical ap-
proximation, for γ = 0 (top) and γ = 2.584 (bottom).
In the γ = 0 case the transtion line in the conical ap-
proximation deviates considerably from the line given by
the EL solution. However, for γ = 2.584 the conical ap-
proximation predicts a transition line which is very close
to the EL solution line. As the energy of the approx-
imate conical helicoid is always higher than the energy
of the ground state the approximate transition line lies
always below the EL solution transition line, as can be
appreciated in Fig. 9.

z /4γ.

It is easy to understand why the conical approxima-
tion locates the transition line very accurately as the
magnitude of the easy-plane anisotropy increases. The
energy H given by Eq. (1) contains a term γn2
z − βznz =
γ(nz − βz/2γ)2 − β2
If γ is very large the energy
penalty caused by a large deviation of nz from the con-
stant value βz/2γ cannot be compensated by a gain pro-
vided by the other terms in H. In the vicinity of the tran-
sition, however, the energy of the IC state is only slightly
lower than the FFM energy and the conical approxima-
tion does not capture the nature of the transition. The
diﬀerences between the IC and the FFM states are pre-
cisely due to the spatial variation of the spin. The small
variation of nz allows the IC to reach the FFM state
continuously. Consider for instance in the transition at
constant βx depicted in the top left panel of Fig. 1. The
transition takes place continuously when the spin path

(red points) collapse onto the FMM (blue axis). This is
not possible in the conical approximation, in which the
spin conﬁguration paths are forced to follow the parallels
of the unit spheres of Fig. 1. As it gives discontinuous
transitions along the whole transition line, the conical ap-
proximation does not predict the continuous transitions
nor the tricritical behaviour.

Let us develop a further approximation, which we call
the decoupling approximation, in which we assume also a
conical ground state. We shall denote by βxc = (π2/16)q2
0
and βzc = 2γ + q2
0 the parallel and perpendicular critical
ﬁelds, respectively. We notice that, for large γ, the value
of cos θ0 is determined basically by the three ﬁrst terms
of (13). The term proportional to βx, which, we recall,
is the diﬀerence between the energies of the conical heli-
coid (12) and the conical helix with ϕ(z) = q0z, gives a
minor contribution. Indeed, at low βx and βz the coni-
cal helicoid is a slightly distorted conical helix; at low βx
and large βz the term proportional to βx is clearly a small
correction; and for βx close to βxc the energy of the con-
ical helicoid is very close to the energy of the FFM state,
which happens to be close to the energy of the conical
helix18. Hence, in the decoupling approximation we have
cos θ0 = βz/βzc. Minimization of the energy with respect
to κ gives an equation similar to that of the well known

βz = 0 case: E(κ)/κ = psin θ0βxc/βx. The phase tran-

sition takes place continuously when κ = 1, that is when
βx/βxc = sin θ0, and, taking into account the value of
sin θ0, we get the following expression for the transition
line:

(14)

βz/βzc =p1 − β2

x/β2

xc .

The continuous green lines of Fig. 9 are the curves cor-
responding to the above equation. We see that they de-
scribe very accurately the transition line for large easy-
plane anisotropy, but it departs notably from the EL
solution for low γ.
Interestingly, equation (14) shows
that the form of the transition line for high anisotropy is
universal when expressed in terms of the dimensionless
ﬁelds βx/βxc and βz/βzc. We see that the decoupling
approximation is as accurate as the conical approxima-
tion, or even more, and it has the virtue of providing a

other hand, the decoupling approximation suﬀers from
the same limitations as the conical approximation and
does not predict correctly the nature of the transition, as
it gives always continuous transitions.

VII. APPLICATION TO CrNb3S6

The general results obtained in this work can be read-
ily applied to CrNb3S6. For this compound, a ≈ 1.2 nm.
Other measurable parameters like the critical parallel
and perpendicular ﬁelds, Hxc and Hzc respectively, and
the the zero ﬁeld helix period, L0, depend strongly on
the sample. As an instance8, we take L0 ≈ 48 nm and
Hxc ≈ 2300 Oe. A value γ = 2.584q2
0 ensures the re-
lation Hzc ≈ 10Hxc tipically observed experimentally.
The large easy-plane anisotropy implies that the loca-
tion transition line is accurately given by the results of
the conical approximation of Ref. 15, and, morover, it is
given by the Eq. (14) derived in the present work, so that

Hz/Hzc =p1 − H 2

(15)

x/H 2

xc .

The critical ﬁelds Hxc and Hzc depend strongly on the
sample. Due to impurities, crystalline defects, etc., each
sample will be theoretically described by a diﬀerent set of
the model eﬀective parameters. The anisotropy, however,
is expected to be large for all samples, so that Eq. (15)
holds for any sample, and thus the phase transition line in
CrNb3S6 is universal (independent of the sample) when
expressed in terms of the dimensionless ﬁelds Hx/Hxc
and Hz/Hzc.

approaching the CTL2, increasing the perpendicular ﬁeld
Hx with the parallel ﬁeld Hz hold constant below 12500
Oe, or increasing the parallel ﬁeld with the perpendic-
ular ﬁeld hold constant above 1850 Oe, or increasing a
ﬁeld tilted from the DM by an angle α smaller than 81
degrees.

Furthermore, a line of discontinuous transitions ap-
pears in the phase diagram of CrNb3S6, and therefore
phenomena typical of ﬁrst order transitions, like phase
coexistence and hysteresis in magnetisation and magne-
toresistance, are expected.

The position of the tricritical points on the transition
line, however, is not universal and depend on the sam-
ple. For the values reported in Ref. 8 (Hxc ≈ 2300 Oe
and Hzc ≈ 23000 Oe) we get ~H = 3729 ~β Oe, and
thus the tricritical points TC1 and TC2 are predicted
to be at, respectively, (H t1

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this work the important and long-standing prob-
lem of the determination of the phase diagram of the
mono-axial chiral helimagnet at zero temperature in the
magnetic ﬁled plane has been addressed. The transition

line from the incommensurate phase to the commensu-
rate forced FM state has been thoroghly analysed as a
function of the single-ion aniotropy and the nature tran-
sitions has been elucidated. We have shown that generi-
cally the transition line is composed by a line of discon-
tinuous transition separated from two lines of continuous
transitions by two tricritical points. The nature of the
singularities at the transition line has also been thor-
oughly analysed and we showed that the transition from
the chiral soliton lattice to the forced FM state along the
continuous transtion line is characterized by logarithmic
singularities analogous to those characteristic of the case
of purely perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld. This characteris-
tic singular behaviour may be used to locate one of the
tricritical points.

For large anisotropy the conical and the decoupling ap-
proximations give the location of the transition line very
accurately, but they fail in characterising the nature of
the transition, since the former predicts a discontinuous
transition along the whole line and the later continuous
transitions everywhere. Consequently, the tricritical be-
haviour is not predicted by none of these approximations.
For large anisotropy we found that the form of the tran-
sition line is universal, given by Eqs. (14) or (15). The
position of the tricritical points on the transtion line is
not universal, however, and has to be computed for each
sample.

Hence, unexpected predictions for the low temperature
regime of CrNb3S6 are given: discontinuous transitions,
tricritical behaviour, and the universality (that is, the
independence of the sample) of the form of the transi-
tion line due to the large anisotropy characteristic of this
compound. These phenomena may have interesting ap-
plications in spintronics.
It remains to study the very
interesting question of how the phase diagram evolve by
increasing the temperature. Work in this direction is in
progress19.

Appendix A: Numerical procedure

The strategy to ﬁnd a solution to the problem is as
follows: for given L and ξ0 or φ0, we solve numerically
the BVP deﬁned either by Eqs. (4) or (5); for ﬁxed L, we
tuned either ξ0 or φ0 and repeat the computation until
periodicity is reached; then, we compute the energy per
period E via a numerical quadrature algorithm. Finally,
we determine the period L which minimizes E with a
minimisation algorithm. Alternatively, we can minimize
E as a function of the two variables ξ0 (or φ0) and L.
Both approaches give the same result, as the minimum

9

of the energy as a function of the BC for ﬁxed L is the
periodic solution which satisﬁes Eqs. (2).

To solve numerically the BVPs deﬁned by eqs. (4)
or (5) we used a relaxation method as described in Ref. 20
(see also Ref. 21). The BVP solver works as follows.
First, the two second order diﬀerential equations are con-
verted in a set of four ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations in
the usual way, by introducing two new variables ω and v
and two new equations which relate them to the deriva-
tives of ϕ and ξ: ω = dϕ/dz, v = dξ/dz. Then, this
system of ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations is converted
in a system of ﬁnite diﬀerence equations by substituting
the derivatives by forward ﬁnite diﬀerences. Therefore,
a mesh with N + 1 points (z0 = 0, z1, . . . , zN = L) is
introduced. For simplicity, we used a regular mesh, so
that zn − zn−1 = L/N for n = 1, . . . , N . The ﬁnite dif-
ference equations and the BC form a set of 4(N + 1)
non-linear algebraic equations (4N of them given by the
diﬀerence equations and the remaining 4 provided by the
BC) with 4(N + 1) unknowns, which are the values of
ξ(z), ϕ(z), v(z), and ω(z) at the mesh points. The al-
gebraic equations are solved numerically with a Newton
algorithm, which proceedes iteratively starting from one
initial guess which has to be supplied. Subsequently, E is
computed with a simple quadrature algorithm using the
values h(z) calculated at the mesh points.

Periodicity is enforced by tuning ξ0 until the condi-
tions ω(L) = ω(0) and v(L) = v(0) are met. The two
equations can be enforced by tuning only one variable,
ξ0. The reason is that we exploited translational sym-
metry to eliminate the freedom in the BC for ϕ, which
in general should read ϕ(0) = ϕ0 and ϕ(L) = ϕ0 + 2π.
Hence, periodicity can be enforced by tuning ϕ0 and ξ0.
Translational invariance implies that we can set ϕ0 = 0,
taking into account that, on physical grounds, there has
to be a point in which the spin lies in the plane formed
by the DM axis and the magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., with ϕ = 0).
Hence, we enforce the condition v(L)−v(0) = 0 by tuning
ξ0 via a simple bracketing-bisection algorithm, and the
other condition is automatically satisﬁed. Finally, the
minimum of E as a function of L is obtained also with a
simple bracketing-bisection algorithm.

To control the numerical errors we set very demand-
ing values for the convergence tolerances of the diﬀer-
ent algorithms: 10−14 for the BPS solver, 10−12 for the
computation of E, and 10−11 for the bracketing-bisection
algorithms. The eﬀect of the discretization was taken
into account when computing E via the quadrature algo-
rithm. The mesh was reﬁned iteratively, the number of
points being doubled at each iteration, until the diﬀer-
ence between the values of E computed in two succesive
iterations was smaller than the tolerance (10−12). In this
way we were able to get the ground state with high ac-
curacy.

The main issue is the convergence of the BVP solver,
which works iteratively so that to get convergence the
initial guess functions have to be close enough to the
actual solution. We achieve this by varying βz by small

steps and using the solution found at one βz as the seed
for the next step. We start at βz = 0, taking advantage
of the fact that the solution is analytically known there.
This procedure is sound as we expect the IC structure to

be continuous on ~β, as it is in the cases where the ﬁeld is
either perpendicular or parallel. The results conﬁrm this
point.
