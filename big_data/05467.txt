Abstract

Ward identities in the most general “network matrix model” from [1] can be described in terms of
the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebras (DIM). This conﬁrms an expectation that such algebras and their various
limits/reductions are the relevant substitutes/deformations of the Virasoro/W- algebra for (q, t) and (q1, q2, q3)
deformed network matrix models. Exhaustive for these purposes should be the Pagoda triple-aﬃne elliptic
DIM, which corresponds to networks associated with 6d gauge theories with adjoint matter (double elliptic
systems). We provide some details on elliptic qq-characters.

Introduction

Recently, basing on the previous studies in [2]-[11], we introduced [1] a generic Dotsenko-Fateev (DF) [4] network
conformal matrix model, associated with the most general brane web/network (the low-energy limit of toric
Calabi-Yau compactiﬁcations). The ﬁrst question to ask about this theory is what is the set of the relevant
“Virasoro/W- constraints”: the Ward identities, which are satisﬁed by its partition function. In this paper, we
argue that the substitute/deformation of the CFT stress tensor, which generates these identities, is now provided
by the analogues of the q-characters [12] in the elliptic Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra (DIM) [13, 14], as anticipated
at diﬀerent deformation levels in [15]-[19].

We remind [2] that there are three equivalent ways to derive Ward identities in matrix models (and other

quantum ﬁeld and string theory models):

(i) by making a change of integration variable [20],
(ii) by considering an average of a total derivative [21] and
(iii) by building a matrix model from a free ﬁeld correlator with a given symmetry [3, 22].

The ﬁrst two methods can seem identical, but in fact this is not quite true: (ii) is technically simpler (more
straightforward) than (i), but instead the emerging algebraic structure is more diﬃcult to reveal. Ideal for this
task is the method (iii), which we now brieﬂy remind.

with a given (T -induced) symmetry as a matrix element. Conformal matrix models [3] arise in this way when
matrix elements are correlators of 2d free ﬁelds and integrals or sums over partitions (interpreted as matrix
model eigenvalue integrals/sums) emerge from an explicit description of screening charges ˆQ (which are the
centralizer of ˆT ) in the free ﬁeld Fock space.

Figure 1: a) Type IIA brane diagram consisting of two horizontal and three vertical intersecting lines representing NS5 and D4
branes. The low energy theory in this background is 4d N = 2 gauge theory with SU (2)2 gauge group. Λi are exponentiated
complexiﬁed gauge couplings, a(a) are Coulomb moduli and ma are the hypermultiplet masses. b) The toric diagram of the
Calabi-Yau threefold, corresponding to the 5d gauge theory with the same matter content. Edges represent two-cycles with
complexiﬁed K¨ahler parameters Qi, which play the same role as the distances between the branes in a). c) The quiver encoding the
matter content of the gauge theory. SU (2) gauge groups live on each node and bifundamental matter on each edge. The squares
represent pairs of (anti)fundamental matter hypermultiplets.

Reversing the logic, one can start from generic network matrix model [1], associated with the toric diagram

simplify the formula. Two of the deformation parameters are also parameterized as q = e1, t = e−2 and the
third one is put equal to q3 = t/q in 5d theory, while in 6d theories it remains free. In fact, at least, at the
algebraical level, more Kerov parameters [25] of the same nature can also be included [24]. Especially important
is the elliptic case, where inﬁnite set of Kerov parameters form a geometric progression. For generic deformation
the model belongs to the universality class [27, 28] of the double elliptic integrable systems [29] and is invariant
under a rich set of large canonical transformations (dualities). As to the inﬁnitesimal transformations, they also
form an interesting closed algebra of Ward identities, which can be revealed by the following sequence of steps
brieﬂy encountered above:

• Ward identities satisﬁed by the matrix integral can be described in two ways. In the free ﬁeld terms they
are provided by the free ﬁeld operators ˆWa that are deﬁned to commute with the screening charges, while
in terms of time variables (i.e. literally as a set of constraints imposed on the time-dependent integral)
they are expressed with the help of the intertwiner ˆG(p):

Wa(p, ∂p)ZΓ(cid:96) (p) =

0

= 0

(7)

The question is what is the algebra formed by this set of constraints on a matrix integral. In simplest
examples this is just a Borel subalgebra of Virasoro or various Wma algebras, where ma are related by the
number of horizontal edges in Γ (e.g. m1 = m2 = 2 in Fig. 1).

• Toroidal algebra. One can embed all the Wma -algebras associated with the set of matrix integrals
of a given type into a larger algebra. For instance, in the case of Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated
with Nekrasov functions and topological vertices corresponding to all graphs, this gives rise to toroidal
algebras: aﬃne Yangians in the case of 4d Nekrasov functions [30, 19], Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) (quantum
toroidal) algebra in the 5d case [13, 14, 31] and elliptic DIM algebra in the 6d case [32, 9]. Concrete quiver
corresponds to a set of representations of the toroidal algebra given by a ﬁxed number of Young diagrams.
Moreover, the (reﬁned) topological vertex can be obtained as a matrix element of the intertwining operators
of the DIM algebra [33]. We concentrate below on the level 1 representation of DIM algebra so that there
always exists a simple bosonization [32]. For generic levels an analogue of the free-ﬁeld representation of
Kac-Moody algebras [34] will be needed.

• qq-characters. Generalized stress tensor operators ˆWa can be actually understood in terms of the DIM R-
matrices, and from this perspective they give abstract algebraic description of the qq-characters [16, 17, 18].
This construction generalizes ordinary q-characters for quantum groups introduced in [12].

• Systems of symmetric functions. One can associate with the set of matrix integrals/algebra a set of
symmetric functions in two diﬀerent ways. One option is to construct them directly from the integral,
omitting one set of integrations [35, 36]. In the simplest example of the matrix integral with n = 1 we ﬁx
the Young diagram λ with lengths of lines λα, α = 1 . . . (m − 1) and the corresponding symmetric function
of variables xi ≡ x(N )

corresponding to λ is given by the matrix integral

where λm is put equal to m. This is a generalization of old formulas from [37] and and it can be considered
as an extension of the degenerate ﬁeld insertion into the conformal block [38] in the DF approach.

pn =(cid:80)

Another way to construct symmetric functions [36, 10] is to consider a level 1 representation of the algebra
so that it is realized by the Heisenberg algebra. Choose a Hamiltonian as an element of the algebra, it
is a function of generators an. Realizing them in terms of time variables, an<0 ∼ pn, an>0 ∼ ∂pn , one
obtains a set of eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian as functions of pn. After the Miwa transformation,
i they give rise to symmetric functions of xi. For instance, the level one representation of the
DIM gl1 algebra leads to the set of gl1 Macdonald polynomials. As a next step, one can consider the sets
of eigenfunctions which diagonalize co-products (of degree N − 1) of the Hamiltonian (i.e. representations
of higher levels), which, in this concrete example, leads to the generalized glN Macdonald polynomials.
• Lift to the graph level. The next step is restoration of the vertical/horizontal symmetry and lifting
the symmetry (Ward identities) to the original network matrix model (4). Important at this step is that
topological vertices are associated with matrix elements of the intertwining operators of the DIM algebra
[33].

The crucial ingredient of this construction is the centralizer of the algebra of constraints, deﬁning the screening
operators and the matrix model. The centralizer depends on the representation, and it is this dependence that
leads to a variety of diﬀerent matrix models, encoded by the graph Γ. Once the graph (with some additional
decorations: preferred direction, etc.) is chosen, the particular representation of DIM is ﬁxed and so is the
particular matrix model. However, traces of the larger DIM symmetry remain in various forms, the most notable
example being the spectral duality [39, 11, 40] connecting multi-matrix models with diﬀerent numbers of matrices
and vertex operator insertions.

In the simplest case, associated with 4d Seiberg-Witten theory, the role of ˆT is played by the stress tensor
T (z) = 1
2 ∂φ(z)2 + Q∂2φ(z), which generates the ordinary Virasoro algebra (and its WN -algebra generalizations),
and Z(t) is just the ordinary Dotsenko-Fateev (DF) matrix model of [4]. Various types of q/t/q123-deformations,
associated with reviving of the hidden compactiﬁcation moduli, i.e. revealing the hidden 6d and M-theory nature
of the theory, require a lifting/resolution of 1
2 ∂φ(z)2 + Q∂2φ(z) of a peculiar Toda-like combination of vertex
operators:

(11)

Given these q-boson relations, T (z) generates the q-deformed Virasoro algebra Virq,t. Deformed stress-energy
tensor (9) can be guessed from the requirement that it commutes with the screening current. The expression for
the screening current essentially determines the matrix model and its symmetry. Concretely, the q-deformed
screening current is given by

S(x) = :

We will derive the formulas for T and S in detail in sec. 2.2.5, in particular we obtain the form (9) of stress-energy
tensor in Eq. (48).
One can see that the expressions for T and S are not symmetric under the exchange of t and q−1, which is,
as we will see, the natural symmetry of the DIM algebra. This is another artifact of the choice of a concrete
representation/matrix model description of the object with larger symmetry. All the essential quantities of
each particular model should be symmetric w.r.t. q ↔ t−1, though the intermediate results do not respect this
symmetry.

As already mentioned, a nice bonus is that multi-ﬁeld generalization of (9), which in 4d leads to substitution
of Virasoro by W -algebras, is now just another representation of the same symmetry algebra. In other words,
after the deformation the Sugawara-like bi- and multi-linear combinations of currents can be obtained from
comultiplication of the deformed current algebra, without a need to consider its universal enveloping.

The purpose of this paper is a sketchy survey of this remarkable DIM symmetry of (4). Various details will
be presented in separate publications. We will discuss here the 5d and 6d DIM gl1 algebras which correspond to
the quiver gauge theories with fundamental matter. The most interesting case of the DIM aﬃne algebras which
describe, in particular, the 6d gauge theory with adjoint matter and correspond to the double elliptic systems
will be touched only brieﬂy. This issue, and also various details of other cases will be presented in separate
publications.

2 A1 (q, t)-matrix model

Let us start with the prototypical example of the A1 (q, t)-deformed conformal matrix model. This is the simplest
model where q-Virasoro symmetry arises and, therefore, serves as an accessible port of entry to the land of DIM
algebras.

In this section we describe the general scheme for investigating a network-type matrix model. We start by
writing down the conventional deﬁnition of the model in terms of matrix integral. However, one should remember,
that this is just a particular representation of the network of topological vertices, as in Eq. (3). We next describe
the algebraic face of the matrix model more concretely by specifying the screening operators, which OPE gives
the actual matrix model integrals. The centralizer of the screenings inside the representation of DIM gives the
W -algebra corresponding to the matrix model, which also generates the qq-characters in the gauge theory. This
description was used in [18] to introduce the W -algebras corresponding to an arbitrary (aﬃne) ADE-type quiver.
Our aim in this paper is more general (though in this section we study it on a very humble example). We would
like to elucidate the hidden symmetries, which are only visible in the network-type formalism (3) (see [11] for an
example of such an approach). The symmetries of the network/topological string/toric diagram are described

5

by DIM algebra, of which diﬀerent W -algebras are only particular representations/subalgebras. In this part of
the paper we will demonstrate explicitly how various concepts in matrix models and gauge theories, such as
qq-characters and generalized Macdonald polynomials, are tied together with the help of the DIM algebra.

We introduce the DIM algebra generators and relations in sec. 2.2.1. We describe the simplest representations
of DIM algebra in sec. 2.2.3 and show how they give rise to generalized Macdonald polynomials. In sec. 2.2.5
with the help of dressing operators, we build the deformed Virasoro subalgebra of the DIM algebra and show its
connection to qq-characters in the gauge theory. In sec. 2.2.6 we focus on the details of the dressing procedure
and identify it with the reduction of the “U (1) part” in the Nekrasov function/conformal block. We also describe
the relation with Benjamin-Ono integrable system.

2.1 Free-ﬁeld description

The matrix model can be described in two diﬀerent ways: as a Jackson or contour integrals respectively. Here
we adopt the latter form:

(cid:73)

dN x ∆(q,t)(x)V1(z1, x)··· VM (zM , x),

where

What are the Ward identities for the (q, t)-matrix model? To obtain them let us perform the steps we discussed

and, second, we verify that the deformed stress-energy tensor T (z) (9) commutes with the integral of the

of operators inside S(x) plays a crucial role in this cancellation, and only the total diﬀerence remains singular.
Since the poles are canceled up to total q-diﬀerence, the commutator with screening charge, i.e. with the integral
of S(x) vanishes. This fact was used in [18] to derive the regularity of the qq-characters.
This implies that T (z) is a symmetry of the model: negative modes of its Laurent expansion in z annihilate
the vacuum and thus annihilate the entire matrix integral. Inserting the T -S OPE into the matrix integral, we
get:

leading to a diﬀerence equation on the partition function, a counterpart of the Baxter equation. It is sometime
called a qq-character [16, 18, 17, 19], since it can be considered as a deformation of the Frenkel-Reshetikhin
q-character [12] (trace over Cartan part of the quantum R-matrix). Virasoro symmetry of the matrix model
implies that this average has no negative modes in its z-expansion, i.e. is regular (and therefore polynomial) in z:

regularity of the qq-character = polynomiality of the average (cid:104)T (z)(cid:105) =

in (22).
Also qq-characters can be thought of as the recurrence relation on the matrix model correlators, obtained by
expanding the average of T (z) in powers of z. The recurrence relations can also be derived by considering the
vanishing total diﬀerence under the matrix model integral [11]. Of course, this only means that the commutator
of T (z) and S(x) is given by the corresponding total diﬀerence. In the case at hand the relevant total diﬀerence

technique to get the symmetry constraints for the elliptic matrix model in sec. 3.

In the next section we show how to obtain the deformed energy-momentum tensor from the representation of

the abstract DIM algebra.

2.2 Abstract algebraic description

We now describe the algebraic structures of DIM algebra governing the network-type matrix model. Let us

ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of the DIM algebra Uq((cid:98)(cid:98)gl1) and its simplest representations and then demonstrate the

connections of this algebra with deformed Virasoro algebra, qq-characters, generalized Macdonald polynomials
and integrable systems.

2.2.1 DIM algebra

This looks like a deformation of the aﬃne quantum algebra Uq((cid:98)gl2) with the positive/negative root generators

x±(z), two exponentiated Cartan generators ψ±(z) and the central element γ.

Commutation relations are

[x+(z), x−(w)] =

G∓(z/w) x±(z) x±(w) = G±(z/w) x±(w) x±(z)

2.2.2 Speciﬁcation of the structure function

The structure of the algebra is encoded in the function G(z) which is often chosen to be cubic in z with additional
restriction q1q2q3 = 1:

G±(z) = (1 − q1z)(1 − q2z)(1 − q3z) =(cid:0)1 − q±1z(cid:1)(cid:0)1 − t∓1z(cid:1)(cid:0)1 − (t/q)±1z(cid:1)

(29)

Without any harm to commutation relations and comultiplication it can be further promoted to unrestricted q123-
and more general Kerov deformations, and even to elliptic function, though details of bosonization procedure
below should still be worked out in these cases. We describe the elliptic version in sec. 3.

2.2.3 Level one Fock representation

The simplest representation of DIM algebra is the level one representation ρu acting on the Fock module
Fu, generated by the q-deformed Heisenberg creation operators a−n from the vacuum |u(cid:105) annihilated by the
annihilation operators an. The Heisenberg generators satisfy
1 − q|n|
1 − t|n| δn+m,0

[an, am] = n

(30)

Note that an are normalized diﬀerently from αn in eqs. (10), (11) (that normalization was chosen to maximally
simplify the ﬁnal expressions). Of course the an generators are related to αn generators in a simple way:

The generators of the DIM algebra are expressed in terms of the Heisenberg generators:

2.2.4 Level two Fock representation and generalized Macdonald polynomials
Tensor product of m Fock representations Fu1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Fum can be easily obtained from the comultiplication (28)
and will be called the level m Fock representation. In this tensor product the generators of DIM algebra are
expressed in terms of m q-Heisenberg generators a(a)
n , a = 1, . . . , m. In particular, we will need the expression
for x+(z) in this representation:

(x+(z)) = u1(cid:101)Λ1(z) + u2(cid:101)Λ2(z) = u1η1(z) + u2ϕ−

ρ(2)
u1,u2

where we use the shorthand notation(cid:101)Λ1,2 for the components of the level two representation ρ(2)

and the subscript denotes the number of term in the tensor product, e.g. η1(z) = η(z) ⊗ 1.

There is an distinguished basis in Fu1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Fum, the basis of generalized Macdonald polynomials [10]

These polynomials were instrumental in demonstrating the 5d version of the AGT conjecture [41]. Matrix
elements of Virasoro primary ﬁelds in this basis turned out to coincide with ﬁxed point contributions in the
Nekrasov partition function. Thus, after decomposition of conformal blocks in terms of generalized Macdonald
polynomials, the AGT relation becomes explicit. In the 4d limit this special basis degenerates into the basis of
generalized Jack polynomials [10], with similar properties.

2.2.5 W -algebra, Ward identities and qq-characters from DIM

As we have announced in the introduction, the great beneﬁt of DIM approach is that it describes diﬀerent matrix
models from a uniﬁed viewpoint. In particular, m-multimatrix models have Wm-algebra symmetries, and these
algebras are all particular representations of subalgebras of DIM algebra.

q-deformed Wm-algebra, which is also called Wq,t(slm), is obtained from level m Fock representation of the
DIM algebra as follows. The stress-energy tensor of the Wm-algebra is obtained from the dressing of the x+
generator of DIM. More concretely, we have:

where

−(cid:88)

A(z) = exp

and bn are the modes of the ψ± generators:

(39)

(40)

(41)

The stress-energy tensor T of the WM -algebra is the representation of the dressed current t(z) in the level m
Fock module. For the Virasoro case (m = 2), using Eq. (35), we get

T (z) = ρ(2)

u1,u2

(t(z)) = u1Λ1(z) + u2Λ2(z) =

where Λi(z) are dressed versions of the components (cid:101)Li(z). From Eq. (42) we see that T (z) depends on two

sets of Heisenberg generators (hidden inside η1, η2 and ϕ−) acting on the tensor product of two Fock modules.
However, as we will see explicitly in the next section, the expression for T actually depends only on one linear
combination of a(1)
n and a(2)
n . Related to this fact is that in the level two representation the product of Λ1,2
elements is equal to identity:

From these expressions we see that indeed : Λ1(z)Λ2 (zq/t) : = 1. We also identify the combinations of creation

and annihilation operators, on which T depends, and denote these combinations by (cid:101)α. They are given by

tensor T are all nicely written in terms of these combinations:

One can see that the commutation relations for (cid:101)αn are the same as for α(1)

where the deﬁnition of (cid:101)Φ is similar to that of Φ from Eq. (10), only the role of bosons αn is now played by (cid:101)αn.
Finally, the operators (cid:101)αn are in fact precisely those bosonic operators, in terms of which we have deﬁned our

The constants u1 and u2 can be absorbed into the deﬁnition of zero modes, which brings Eq. (48) into the form
of the deformed stress-energy tensor identity (9). The zero modes of the screening operators are omitted to
simplify the formulas.

n . Now Λ1,2 and the stress-energy

matrix model (19). We have, therefore, identiﬁed the Ward identities/Virasoro constraints of the matrix model
with the particular combination of the DIM operators in the level two Fock representation. We can also make
the identiﬁcation with qq-character more explicit by introducing the usual notation:

Λ2(z) = Y−1

The last deﬁnition follows from the condition (43). Now we would like to understand where the other combination
of the bosonic generators is hidden. To see this we have to revisit the dressing procedure, for the current t(z).
2.2.6 Virq,t ⊕ Heisq,t reduction is equivalent to dressing
In this section we show how the dressing operators α(z) and β(z) are in fact performing the reduction of the
algebra Virq,t ⊕ Heisq,t acting in the level two Fock representation to its Virq,t part. The condition (43) can
be thought of as a gauge condition used to kill the Heisq,t degrees of freedom, which enter both Λ1 and Λ2
multiplicatively. This separation of variables is usual for description of Hamiltonian reductions in the free ﬁeld
formalism [42].

To this end let us look at the bosonization of the dressing operators A(z) and B(z). From Eqs. (33), (40) we

These bosons commute with (cid:101)αn and satisfy slightly modiﬁed (compared to (11)) commutation relations among
Since the Virq,t algebra is entirely built out of (cid:101)αn, the new generators ¯αn commute with Virq,t and form the

(1 + (q/t)n) (1 − tn)

n(1 − qn)(q/t)n

additional q-deformed Heisenberg algebra Heis. One can recall that such a situation is common in the study
of AGT relations [43], where Nekrasov function [44, 45] usually corresponds to the conformal block [46] of the

representation:

Virasoro algebra times an additional “U (1) factor”, which corresponds to an extra boson, forming the Heis
algebra [47]. Here we get the extra boson for similar reasons: we are working in the tensor product of two Fock
modules, and have to eliminate the “diagonal part” of the bosonized algebra. This elimination corresponds to
the dressing transformation, which is nothing but the transformation to the “center of mass frame” for the two
bosons α(1,2)

.

Finally, we can write down a compact expression for the undressed current x+(z) in the level two Fock

(cid:0)x+(z)(cid:1) = u1(cid:101)Λ1(z) + u2(cid:101)Λ2(z) = T (z)Z(z) = T (z) : e ¯Φ(z)− ¯Φ(z/t) :

(53)
where ¯Φ(z) is again the bosonic ﬁeld deﬁned analogously to (10) using ¯αn generators. We introduced the Heisq,t
qq-character Z(z), in terms of which the undressed current factorizes into the product of two terms corresponding
to algebras in Virq,t ⊕ Heisq,t.

The factorized form of the current x+(z) is also reﬂected in structure of its zero mode: the H gen

operator.
Written in this form it gives the trigonometric generalization of the Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation [48], the
continuous integrable model also related to the AGT correspondence. It is easy to see the structure of the BO
Hamiltonians in the double scaling limit q → 1, t = qβ:

fact joint polynomial eigenfunctions of the quantum BO system.

3 Elliptic DIM algebra and elliptic matrix model

In this section we describe the elliptic generalization of the matrix model and DIM algebra governing it. As we
will see, most of the discussion is exactly parallel to the trigonometric case. This is another manifestation of the
universality of network type matrix models and the DIM algebra. The fact that the description of the elliptic
case is so similar to the trigonometric one gives one the hope that the corresponding structure in the double
elliptic case might also be tractable.

Notice the presence of two sets of boson generators ˆαn and ˆβn, which is related to the modular invariance of the
elliptic model. More concretely two bosons produce two terms in the product representation the theta-function:
k≥0(1 − q(cid:48)kz)(1 − q(cid:48)kq(cid:48)/z), the elliptic version of the free ﬁeld correlator (1 − z). This explains why the powers
of z in front of ˆαn and ˆβn are opposite, and also why their commutation relation diﬀer by q(cid:48)|n|.

Of course, the stress-energy tensor, which generates the centralizer of the screening charge Q =(cid:72) S(x)dx/x

also depends on two sets of bosonic variables. It is very analogous to the trigonometric case:

T (z) = : e ˆΦ(z)e− ˆΦ(t−1z) : + t : e− ˆΦ(tz/q)e ˆΦ(z/q) :

(64)

This elliptic stress-energy tensor generates the elliptic deformation of the Virasoro algebra, which has been
considered in many works [9]. We proceed along the lines of the previous section and move to the corresponding
DIM algebra, which gives tensor T in the level two representation.

3.2 Elliptic DIM algebra, elliptic Virasoro and ILW equation
Elliptic version of DIM algebra is generated by the same set of operators as the ordinary DIM: x±(z), ψ±(z) and
the central element γ. The relations are a copy of Eq. (27), except for the [x+, x−] relation, which changes to

[x+(z), x−(w)] =

Θq(cid:48)(q; q(cid:48))Θq(cid:48)(t−1; q(cid:48))
(q(cid:48); q(cid:48))3∞Θq(cid:48)(q/t; q(cid:48))

(cid:16)

δ(γ−1z/w) ψ+(γ1/2w) − δ(γz/w) ψ−(γ−1/2w)

(65)

(cid:17)

where Θp(z) = (p; p)∞(z; p)∞(p/z; p)∞ is the theta-function. Also, most importantly, the structure function
G±(z) is now not trigonometric, but elliptic:

G±
ell(z) = Θp(q±1z)Θp(t∓1z)Θp(q∓1t±1z),

(66)

The comultiplication ∆ is exactly the same as in the trigonometric case, given by Eqs. (28). As with the matrix
model in the previous section, the essential diﬀerence with the trigonometric case appears when one tries to build
Fock representation of elliptic DIM: one set of bosons turns out not to be enough. We need at least two sets of
Heisenberg generators ˆan and ˆbn to reproduce the commutation relations of the elliptic algebra. Concretely, we

have for the level one representation:

Again, the ﬁelds ˆan, ˆbn are related to ˆαn and ˆβn by a simple redeﬁnition.

The dressed current t(z) = A(z)x+(z)B(z), corresponding to the stress energy tensor is given by exactly
the same expression (39), as in the ordinary DIM case. Moreover, the dressing operators A(z) and B(z) are
constructed from the ψ± generators of the elliptic DIM algebra using the same formulas (40) as give above. In
the level two representation ρ(2)

objects. In the level one representation it gives elliptic Ruijsenaars Hamiltonian, while in the second level
representation it is the diﬀerence version of the intermediate long-wave (ILW) Hamiltonian [49], which itself is a
generalization of the Benjamin-Ono system.

3.3 Ward identities and qq-characters

One can derive Ward identities in the same algebraic fashion as for the trigonometric case. The OPE of the
stress-energy tensor (64) with the screening current (60) is given by:

Θq(cid:48)(cid:0) tx
Θq(cid:48)(cid:0) x

which is non-singular up to total q-diﬀerence due to the same cancellation, as in Eq. (21), and we use the same
time insertion operator (20), but this time depending on two sets of times, pk and ¯pk related to sets of Heisenberg
operators α−n and βn:

This gives the elliptic qq-character corresponding to the 6d gauge theory corresponding to the A1 quiver, i.e. the
gauge group should consist of single SU (n) factor possibly with some fundamental matter hypermultiplets.

As we have seen in the trigonometric case, there is another very explicit way to derive the Ward identities:
to consider the vanishing integral of a cleverly chosen total diﬀerence. In the elliptic case this method work as
well, provided the total diﬀerence is

The resulting equation is, of course the same as Eq. (71). The meaning of the identity (74) in the elliptic
matrix model is the same as in the (q, t)-matrix model: it provides the recurrence relations for the correlators of
arbitrary symmetric functions of xi. It would be interesting to obtain the factorization formulas for the averages
in this model similar to those for the averages of (generalized) Macdonald polynomials in the (q, t)-model. Let
us also mention that in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit Eq. (74) reduces to the quantum spectral curve of the
XYZ spin chain, to the Seiberg-Witten integrable system corresponding to the 6d gauge theory.

This concludes our brief tour into the realm of elliptic matrix models and elliptic DIM algebras. The most
important lesson to learn here is that the DIM description indeed seems to be universal: the elliptic case is
almost literally the same as the trigonometric one.

4 Conclusions and further directions

We have worked out the connection between a large class of network matrix models associated with toric diagrams
and the DIM algebra. The algebra provides a uniﬁed description of the symmetry behind all such matrix models
giving rise to qq-characters, generalized polynomials and Ward identities.

Application of the algebraic description to a matrix model such as (4) requires:

(i) identiﬁcation of a particular free ﬁeld representation of the appropriate DIM associated with the given

model,

(ii) building explicit expressions for the screening operators expressed as integrals of screening currents S(x),
(iii) constructing the symmetry generators (generalized stress-tensors) T (z) for which the screening operators

are the centralizers,

(iv) representing the correlators of screening currents as Vandermonde measures and stress-tensor insertions as
qq-characters which can be converted into the action of diﬀerential/diﬀerence operators. This step relies
on the T -S OPE, which should be nonsingular up to a total diﬀerence, and the S-S OPE, which should
give the desired version of the Vandermonde determinant.

Schematically, one should have

T (z)S(x) = Regular(z, x) + (1 − qx∂x ) Singular(z/x)
S(x1)S(x2) = f (x1/x2) : S(x1)S(x2) :

(75)

15

and the function f (x) deﬁnes the Vandermonde factor through ∆(x) =(cid:81)

of OPEs like (75) see Eqs. (18), (21).

i(cid:54)=j f (xi/xj). For the concrete examples

It is still unclear how to separate the contributions of screening currents and vertex operators in the network
matrix model formalism since both objects are packed into a single intertwiner/topological vertex. Probably, the
technical answer to this question should depend on the “star-chain” duality for conformal blocks.

This procedure is supposed to associate a D-module structure with each particular network matrix model or,
what is the same, with representation of DIM. A non-trivial feature of actual construction, already seen in (9)
and (17) is that the stress tensors are actually build from roots of algebra, while the screening operators from
Cartan generators of DIM, which is somewhat against a naive intuition coming from their realization as powers

∂φ and(cid:72) e±φ in the simplest free ﬁeld conformal theories. General understanding of this phenomena includes

relation between the Sugawara construction and the DIM comultiplication and between the screening charges
and the action of the Weyl group. Remarkably, the Weyl group of elliptic DIM should be the elliptic DAHA, of
which the elliptic Macdonald functions explicitly provided by formulas like (8) in elliptic matrix model (57), are
eigenfunctions.

An interesting question here is interpretation of the BPZ equations [46] for such insertions as the Baxter
equations for symmetric functions of Macdonald family, especially in elliptic case, where there exist alternative
approaches [49].

Figure 2: Topological vertex as the intertwiner of DIM representations. a) The action of the generator x+(z) on the level one Fock
representation ρu sitting on the horizontal leg of the topological vertex (denoted by the dashed line) is the same as its action on
|
v and “diagonal” ρ/−uv. b) Appropriate contraction of two intertwiners is
the product of two representations — the “vertical” ρ
also an intertwiner. This gives the vertex operator of the corresponding conformal ﬁeld theory with deformed Virasoro symmetry,
corresponding to a single vertical brane in Fig. 1.

At the level of network matrix model (3) DIM symmetry generators act on any section which cuts M edges
to separate the diagram into disconnected parts (see Fig. 2). They act as (M − 1)-th coproduct of the original
DIM generators. As was shown in [33], topological vertices are intertwiners of DIM representations, i.e. the
action on one of the legs is equal to the action on two others — this allows to pull the generator through the
vertex (Fig. 2 a)). Moreover, contraction of the legs is consistent with this procedure (Fig. 2 b)). In the result
DIM generators can be pulled from the original section to the right of the diagram, where negative modes
annihilate the Fock vacuum, or to the left, where the positive modes act trivially. This provides the constraints
on the matrix model averages (or, equivalently, gives the qq-characters), which are the 5d generalization of the
constraints obtained in [19]. Fig. 2 actually gives the uplift of the setup considered in [19] to the level of the
topological string (or network matrix model). Further developments of this approach and its applications to
compactiﬁed toric diagrams will be reported elsewhere.

Network matrix model is naturally built from the Seiberg-Witten integrable system — which is a spin chain in
the simplest cases [50, 40]. The network is the tropicalization of its spectral curve, and the vertical and horizontal
branes encode the rank and number of chain sites respectively. The structure of intertwiners/R-matrices forming a
network can be understood as a lift of ordinary trigonometric R-matrices similar to the tetrahedron equation [51].
This will give the connection between the algebraic and integrable parts of the story [31].

After the basic structure of network matrix model constraints is understood, we face a multitude of diﬀerent
paths, each one worth following. First of all, since DIM algebras involves double aﬃnization of any Lie algebra

(we have only considered gl1 case) it can be applied to the aﬃne algebra (cid:98)gl1. This should provide a triply aﬃne
algebra Uq,t,(cid:101)t((cid:98)(cid:98)(cid:98)gl1) with three parameters. In this notation it seems appropriate to name this crucially important

an SL(3, Z) automorphism group [52], corresponding to the automorphisms of the compactiﬁcation torus T3.
In the second part of this paper we have considered elliptic DIM algebra, corresponding to 6d gauge theory
with matter content given by a linear quiver. The elliptization of the triply aﬃne Pagoda algebra should,
therefore, describe the 6d gauge theory with adjoint matter, the most mysterious of all Seiberg-Witten systems,
corresponding to double-elliptic integrable systems and aﬃne elliptic Selberg integrals. However, even without
extra deformations, already the case of elliptic DIM poses interesting questions.

To summarize, the main idea of this paper is that DIM provides a functor, which lifts the picture — a
network — to formulas made out of Nekrasov functions, 3d partitions or topological vertices. In other words,
the input is a tropical spectral curve (associated with the underlying Seiberg-Witten integrable system) and the
output is the partition function of the associated topological string theory, which is provided by one and the

same universal procedure. At the algebraic level the input should be the algebra (cid:98)gl1 which, treated as gl∞ or

W1+∞, incorporates various gln’s, and the output is described by the Pagoda algebra, which still needs to be
fully investigated.
