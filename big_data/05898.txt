THE CONJUGACY ACTION OF Sn AND MODULES INDUCED

FROM CENTRALISERS

SHEILA SUNDARAM

For Benjamin and Priyanka

Abstract. We study representations related to the conjugacy action of the symmetric
group. These arise as sums of submodules induced from centraliser subgroups, and
their Frobenius characteristics have elegant descriptions, often as a multiplicity-free
sum of power-sum symmetric functions. We describe a general framework in which
such representations, and consequently such linear combinations of power-sums, can
be analysed. The conjugacy action for the symmetric group, and more generally
for a large class of groups, is known (from work of Frumkin and Heide-Saxl-Thiep-
Zalesski, respectively) to contain every irreducible. We ﬁnd other representations of
dimension n! with this property, including a twisted analogue of the conjugacy action.
We establish the positivity of the row sums indexed by irreducible characters of the
symmetric group, when restricted to conjugacy classes of partitions with all parts odd.
Another result asserts the positivity of all row sums (except for the one indexed by
the sign character) when the columns exclude the partitions with distinct odd parts.
Our work leads to a new proof that the conjugacy action of the alternating group also
contains every irreducible. By considering two natural submodules of the conjugacy
action, we obtain generalisations of the corresponding results for the symmetric group.
Keywords: conjugacy action, character tables, symmetric power, exterior power, plethysm,
Ramanujan sum.

1. Introduction

This paper is the outgrowth of a uniﬁed approach to some plethystic generating func-
tions that were computed in [21] and [22]. The methods provide a general framework
for analysing representations of the symmetric group which arise as sums of modules
induced from centralisers.
In particular we were led to the study of the conjugation
action of Sn on itself, and related permutation and sign-twisted permutation represen-
tations. Further inspiration was provided by working through the invaluable collection
of problems and references in Richard Stanley’s Enumerative Combinatorics Vol. 2,
and in particular, ([20], Exercise 7.71). It follows from work of Solomon [18] that the
Frobenius characteristic of the Sn-action on itself by conjugation is a positive integer
combination of the power-sum symmetric functions, each one occurring exactly once.
More recently it was shown, ﬁrst in [2], and then in [17], that (for n 6= 2) this rep-
resentation contains every irreducible, or equivalently, the characteristic is a positive
integer combination of every possible Schur function. For the symmetric group Sn, this
translates into the statement that in its character table, the row-sum indexed by any
irreducible character is positive.

Our methods also provide a broad framework for the study of many nonnegative

linear combinations of power-sums.

The conjugacy action has been shown to contain every irreducible for a large class
of groups, including the ﬁnite simple groups ([8]). This result is equivalent to a non-
vanishing condition on the kernel of the adjoint action (as in Passman’s problem [8].)
Interestingly, the symmetric group Sn seems to fall into a separate category from that
studied in [8]. The conjugacy action decomposes into orbits indexed by centralisers;
for Sn these are symmetric powers of representations induced by the trivial character
of a cyclic subroup, and hence our motivation for studying the symmetric and exterior
powers of such representations.

Our investigations result in the discovery of several other Sn-modules with the same
dimension as the regular representation, sharing properties of the conjugation action.
Many seem to contain every irreducible. In addition, the conjugacy action of the alter-
nating subgroup is shown to play a prominent role in these modules.

We write λ ⊢ n to mean that λ is an integer partition λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . of n. Write ℓ(λ)
for the length, or number of parts, of λ. Write P arn for the set of all partitions of n,
DOn for the subset of P arn consisting of partitions with all parts distinct and odd. Fix
n and let Tn denote any subset of the partitions of n. Consider the linear combination

of power-sum symmetric functions PTn = Pλ∈Tn pλ. We will say a symmetric function

is Schur-positive if it is a nonnegative integer combination of Schur functions.

Observe that PTn is the Frobenius characteristic of a possibly virtual Sn-module
of nonzero dimension if and only if Tn includes the partition (1n), in which case the
dimension is n!. Also note that the case Tn = P arn corresponds to the result mentioned
above about the conjugation action of Sn. Sample results of this paper, pertaining to
symmetric functions, follow. For the sake of completeness we include Solomon’s result.

Theorem 1.1. For the following choices of Tn, the sums PTn are Schur-positive (and
hence they are the Frobenius characteristic of some Sn-module).

(0) (Corollary 4.3) Tn = P arn.
(1) (Theorem 4.6) Tn = {λ ∈ P arn : λ has all parts odd}.
(2) (Theorem 4.11) Tn = {λ ∈ P arn : n − ℓ(λ) even}.
(3) (Theorem 4.15) Tn = {λ ∈ P arn : λ /∈ DOn, n − ℓ(λ) even}, n ≥ 2.
(4) (Theorem 4.11) Tn = {λ ∈ P arn : λ /∈ DOn}, n ≥ 2.
(5) (Theorem 4.23) Tn = {λ ∈ P arn : λi = 1 or k}, for any ﬁxed k ≥ 1.
(6) (Theorem 5.9) Tn = {λ ∈ P arn : λi divides k}, for any ﬁxed k ≥ 1.
(7) (Theorem 5.9) For a ﬁxed odd prime p, Tn is the subset of partitions of n with

parts in the set {1, 2, p, 2p} such that an even part occurs at most once.

(8) (Theorem 5.9) Tn consists of partitions λ of n such that odd parts are factors of
k, even parts occur at most once and λi even =⇒ (λi/2)|k but λi 6 |k, for any
ﬁxed k ≥ 1.

For the character table of Sn with rows indexed by the irreducible characters, each of
the above translates into a nonnegativity statement about a suitably restricted row-sum,
omitting certain columns (i.e., conjugacy classes). In some cases (e.g., (1)-(4) above) we
are able to establish the stronger statement that these row sums are strictly positive,
with an exception in case (4) for the row indexed by the sign character, which does not
appear.

We note also that by considering induced representations, the statement holds when
each of the subsets described above is modiﬁed by restricting to partitions with at least
m parts equal to 1, for any ﬁxed m ≥ 0.

It is tempting to think that including the partition (1n) in the subset Tn will guarantee
Schur-positivity, by virtue of the dominating presence of the regular representation, but
the following examples show that this is not the case. Suppose Tn consists of (1n)
and all partitions λ of n such that n − ℓ(λ) is odd.
It is easily seen that the sign
representation occurs in PTn with negative multiplicity 1 − |{λ ∈ P arn : n − ℓ(λ) odd}|.
1 + p2p2
For instance, we have PT4 = p4
1 + p3p2 + p4p1, and PT6 =
p6
2 + p3p2p1 + p4p2
1 + p2p4
1 + p6, and in these the sign representation occurs with
multiplicity −1, −2, −4 respectively.

1 + p4, PT5 = p5

1 + p3

1 + p2p3

Other examples are T6 = {(16), (2, 14), (32), (4, 2), (4, 12)} (the multiplicity of the
Schur function indexed by (2, 14) is −1) and T6 = {(16), (23), (3, 13), (4, 12), (4, 2)} : in
the latter the multiplicity of the Schur function indexed by (32) is −1.

The context in which these representations arise is interesting in its own right. We
deﬁne a twisted conjugacy action of Sn on itself, as the following sum of induced modules
from centralisers. Recall that the centraliser of a permutation with mi cycles of length
i is a direct product of wreath product groups ×iSmi[Ci], where Ci is a cyclic subgroup
of order i. First deﬁne a representation of the wreath product Sk[Cm] so that Sm acts
by conjugation on the m-cycles, and Sk acts on the k disjoint m-cycles according to
the sign representation. Then take outer tensor products, inducing up to Sn from a
centraliser of the form ×iSmi[Ci]. We call the sum of all such modules, ranging over all
possible conjugacy classes, the twisted conjugacy representation of Sn.
Theorem 1.2. The twisted conjugacy representation is self-conjugate, has dimension
Its Frobenius charactestic is given by PTn where
n!, and contains every irreducible.
Tn = {λ ∈ P arn : λ has all parts odd }.

By considering conjugacy actions (ordinary and twisted) on the subsets of even and

odd permutations separately, we show

Theorem 1.3. (Theorems 4.17 and 4.19) The ordinary (respectively twisted) conjugacy
action on the set of even permutations contains every irreducible for n ≥ 4 (respectively
n ≥ 5) while both actions on the set of odd permutations contain every irreducible except
the sign, for n ≥ 2.

The arguments are technical and make use of number-theoretic results on the distri-
bution of primes. In the case of the ordinary conjugacy action, Frumkin’s result follows
as a corollary.

We also study related representations of the alternating group, and show the following:

Theorem 1.4. (Theorem 6.4) Consider the conjugacy action of the alternating group
An on itself, and the representation of Sn obtained by inducing this action up to Sn.
This is a self-conjugate representation of Sn of dimension n!, in which every irreducible
occurs for n 6= 3. It contains the conjugacy action on the even permutations as an
invariant submodule.

As a corollary of the preceding theorem we obtain a diﬀerent proof of a result that
follows from work of Heide, Saxl, Tiep and Zalesski ([8]), namely, that the conjugacy
action of An (n 6= 3) on itself also contains every An-irreducible. See Section 6.

The case k = 2 of Theorem 1.1 (5) can be generalised in the following direction:

4

SHEILA SUNDARAM

Conjecture 1. Let Ln denote the reverse lexicographic ordering ([12], p.6) on the set

of partitions of n. Then the sum P pλ, taken over any ﬁnal segment of the total order

Ln, i.e., any interval of the form [µ, (1n)] for ﬁxed µ, (and thus necessarily including
the partition (1n)) is Schur-positive.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we describe a general framework
within which these questions can be investigated.
In Section 4 we specialise these
theorems to the conjugacy action of Sn, and in Section 5 we consider symmetric and
exterior powers of an arbitrary linear character of a cyclic subgroup of Sn (the Foulkes
characters [3]). In Section 6 we consider the alternating group, and more generally a
ﬁnite group G with a subgroup H of index 2.

2. The plethystic framework

We follow [12] and [20] for notation regarding symmetric functions. In particular, hn,
en and pn denote respectively the complete homogeneous, elementary and power-sum
symmetric functions. If ch is the Frobenius characteristic map from the representation
ring of the symmetric group Sn to the ring of symmetric functions with real coeﬃcients,
then hn = ch(1Sn) is the Frobenius characteristic of the trivial representation, and
en = ch(sgnSn) is the Frobenius characteristic of the sign representation of Sn. If µ

is a partition of n then deﬁne pµ = Qi pµi; hµ and eµ are deﬁned multiplicatively in

analogous fashion. As in [12], sµ denotes the Schur function indexed by the partition µ;
it is the Frobenius characteristic of the Sn-irreducible indexed by µ. Letting zµ denote
the size of the centraliser in Sn of an element of cycle-type µ, we have that z−1
µ pµ is the
Frobenius characteristic of the class function whose value is 1 on the conjugacy class of
type µ and zero on all other classes. Finally, ω is the involution on the ring of symmetric
functions which takes hn to en, corresponding to tensoring with the sign representation.
If q and r are characteristics of representations of Sm and Sn respectively, they yield
a representation of the wreath product Sm[Sn] in a natural way, with the property
that when this representation is induced up to Smn, its Frobenius characteristic is the
plethysm q[r]. For more background about this operation, see [12].

In this paper we study representations of Sn induced from centralisers. The centraliser
of an element with cycle-decomposition corresponding to the partition µ of n is a direct
product of wreath products ×iSmi[Ci], where µ has mi parts equal to i and Ci is a cyclic
subgroup of order i (generated by an i-cycle). Note that the centraliser has cardinality

zµ =Qi imi(mi!). As indicated in the preceding paragraph, we will make extensive use

of properties of the plethysm operation.

Now let {qi}i≥1 be a sequence of symmetric functions, each qi homogeneous of de-
gree i. For example, each qi may be the Frobenius characteristic of a possibly virtual

representation of Si. Let Q =Pi≥1 qi.
For each partition λ of n ≥ 1 with mi(λ) = mi parts equal to i, let |λ| = n =Pi imi
be the size of λ, and ℓ(λ) = Pi mi(λ) = Pi mi be the length (total number of parts)

of λ. Also we say a partition µ is contained in λ, written µ ⊆ λ, if µi ≤ λi for all i. In
this case λ/µ is a skew partition and sλ/µ is the associated skew Schur function. (When
µ = ∅, sλ is the ordinary Schur function indexed by the partition λ. )

Deﬁne, for each partition λ of n ≥ 1 with mi(λ) = mi parts equal to i,

Also deﬁne

Hλ[Q] =Qi:mi(λ)≥1 hmi[qi] and Eλ[Q] =Qi:mi(λ)≥1 emi[qi].

λ [Q] =Qi:mi(λ)≥1(−1)mihmi[qi] and E±

λ [Q] =Qi:mi(λ)≥1(−1)miemi[qi].
We have, by deﬁnition of H ± (respectively E±), and since Pi mi = ℓ(λ),
Let Q(t) = Pn≥1 tnqn, and consider the plethysms H[Q(t)] and E[Q(t)]. With the

convention that P ar, the set of all partitions of nonnegative integers,
includes the
unique empty partition of zero, by the preceding observations and standard properties
of plethysm [12] we have

Also write Qalt(t) for the alternating sum Pn≥1(−1)i−1tiqi = tq1 − t2q2 + t3q3 − . . . .

Note the diﬀerence with the deﬁnition of H ± and E±, namely, here Qalt(t) is not the
same as Q(−t), (which we would denote by Q±) but rather equals −Q(−t).

We record some properties of plethysm that are important for our purposes (see [12]):

Proposition 2.1. If q, r are symmetric functions of homogeneous degrees m and n,
respectively, g1, g2 are arbitrary symmetric functions, and λ is any partition, then

(1) (f g)[q] = f [q] · g[q];

hn[q + r] =Pn

(3) q[−r] = (−1)deg q · (ωq)[r] = (−1)m(ωq)[r];

(2) sλ[q + r] =Pµ⊆λ sλ/µ[f ]sµ[g]; we single out the special cases λ = (n), λ = (1n) :
(4) ω(q[r]) =(cid:0)ωdeg r(q)(cid:1) [ωr] = (ωn(q)) [ωr].

k=0 hk[q]hn−k[r] and en[q + r] =Pn

k=0 ek[q]en−k[r];

Lemma 2.2. We have

hm2i[ωq2i]em2i+1[ωq2i+1];

λ [Q](cid:1)

=Xλ⊢nYi

Proof. We prove (2.2.1), since (2.2.2) is essentially the same. Observe that |λ| − ℓ(λ) =

Pi(i − 1)mi ≡ Pj(2j)m2j+1 +Pj(2j − 1)m2j ≡ Pj m2j mod 2. Now a calculation

using Proposition 2.1 shows that

ω(Eλ(t))

ω(em2i[q2i]) · ω(em2i+1[q2i+1]) = t|λ|Yi
em2i[ωq2i]hm2i+1[ωq2i+1] = t|λ|Yi

Equation (2.2.2) follows mutatis mutandis; we need only interchange e’s and h’s in
the above sequence. The other equalities follow by applying the previous observations
about H ±
(cid:3)

λ and E±
λ .

Proposition 2.3. Let {qi} be a sequence of symmetric functions with each qi of ho-
mogeneous degree i, and let S be any subset of the positive integers. Let ¯S denote the

complement of S. Let Q(t) = Pi≥1 tiqi as before, and for any subset T of the positive
integers, let QT =Pi∈T tiqi. Then

(1) H[QS(t)] = E±[Q ¯S(t)] · H[Q(t)];
(2) E[QS(t)] = H ±[Q ¯S(t)] · E[Q(t)].
In particular if each qi is the Frobenius characteristic of a true Si-module, then the
coeﬃcient of tn in E±[Q ¯S(t)] · H[Q(t)] (respectively H ±[Q ¯S(t)] · E[Q(t)]) is also the
characteristic of a true Sn-module, for any subset S of the positive integers.

Proof. We only prove (1), since (2) is similar. First note that H[Q(t)] = H[QS(t)] ·

H[Q ¯S(t)]. This follows, for example, by using the fact that H[Q(t)] =Pλ∈P ar Hλ[Q(t)],

and keeping track of partitions λ with parts i ∈ S. Thus we have H[QS(t)] · H[Q ¯S(t)] =
H[Q(t)].

Recall the well-known identity [12] H(t) · E±(t) = 1 = E(t) · H ±(t) (i.e., H and E±
are multiplicative inverses in the ring of symmetric functions, as are E and H ±.) Thus
we have 1/H[Q ¯S(t)] = ( 1
(cid:3)

H )[Q ¯S(t)] = E±[Q ¯S(t)]. The result follows immediately.

The singleton case ¯S = {α} deserves special mention, since then we have E±[Q ¯S(t)] =

Pr≥0(−1)rer[tαqα], and similarly for H ±. Then we have

Corollary 2.4.

H[QS(t)] =Xr≥0

(−1)rer[tαqα]H[Q(t)];

E[QS(t)] =Xr≥0

(−1)rhr[tαqα]E[Q(t)].

In particular if Q and S are such that Hλ[QS] (respectively Eλ[QS]) is a representation
for every λ ⊢ n, then the same is true for the coeﬃcient of tn in the right-hand sides
above.

Next we prove a result giving information about the irreducibles appearing in H[QS]
and E[QS] in this very general setting. We will apply a similar idea in Section 4 to prove
that certain representations of the symmetric group share the property of the regular
representation of containing at least one copy of each irreducible. Curiously, we need a
number-theoretic result.

Theorem 2.5. ( [9], Theorem 418; [16], Sec. 3.1, Exercises 28 and 30;)

(1) (Bertrand’s Postulate): For every positive integer n ≥ 3, there is a prime p such

that n/2 < p < n.

(2) Every positive integer n can be written as a sum of distinct primes and the
integer 1. Equivalently, for every n there is a partition δ of n whose parts are
all distinct, and prime or equal to 1.

Bertrand’s Postulate actually states that for each positive integer m ≥ 2, there is a
prime p such that m < p < 2m. If n = 2m, then n ≥ 4, and n/2 = m, n = 2m. If
n = 2m+1, then n ≥ 5 and we have (n−1)/2 = m < p < 2m < n so that m+1 ≤ p < n.
But n/2 < m + 1 so we are done. If n = 3, clearly the prime 2 satisﬁes n/2 < p < n.

Proposition 2.6. Let {qi : i ≥ 1} be a sequence of Frobenius characteristics of Si-
modules (so q1 = h1). Suppose that whenever k is prime, the representation correspond-
ing to qk contains every irreducible of Sk. Let δ ⊢ n be a partition with all parts prime
and distinct. Then the Sn-module whose characteristic is Hδ[Q] (respectively Eδ[Q])
also contains every Sn-irreducible.

Proof. We have Hδ[Q] = Q qδi where the δi are all distinct and each is either prime
or equal to 1. Thus each δi contains the sum of Schur functions Pλ⊢i sλ. It suﬃces

to establish the result when δ has only two parts, say δ1 = k, δ2 = m. Let µ be a
partition of n, and choose any partition ν of k. Consider the skew-Schur function sµ/ν.
It is well-known [12] that this decomposes into irreducibles according to the formula
ν,ρ are the Littlewood-Richardson coeﬃcients. Since the
skew-Schur function sµ/ν is a nonzero symmetric function, (k < n), there is a partition
ρ ⊢ m such that cµ
ν,ρ 6= 0. Equivalently, for every µ ⊢ n, sµ appears in the product sν · sρ,
which in turn appears in the product qδ1qδ2. This ﬁnishes the proof.

Proof. We use Theorem 3.2 with the specialisation v = 1. Parts (1)-(4) are immediate
from the deﬁnitions. Parts (5) and (6) follow from Theorem 3.2, Equations (3.2.2) and
(3.2.3), by splitting up the sums according to sign, namely:

Xλ⊢n

|λ|−ℓ(λ) even

t|λ|Eλ[F ] + Xλ⊢n

|λ|−ℓ(λ) odd

t|λ|Eλ[F ] = Ym≥1

and, applying the involution ω to the alternating exterior power in Equation (3.2.3):

Adding and subtracting (A) and (B) immediately give (5) and (6) respectively.

Parts (7) and (8) follow in identical fashion using Equation (3.2.1) and (3.2.4).

(cid:3)

Remark 3.5. A well-known classical case is that of the free Lie algebra, obtained by
taking fn with ψ(n) = µ(n), the M¨obius function. In this case fn is the characteristic
of the Sn-module obtained by inducing a faithful irreducible representation of the cyclic
group Cn up to Sn. See ([15], Theorem 8.23), where our Hλ[F ] is written as Uλ, and
([20], Exercise 7.89 (f)) where it is written as Lλ.

Now assume ψ(1) = 1 in the deﬁnition of fn. Then fn is the Frobenius characteristic
of a possibly virtual Sn module of dimension (n − 1)!, whose restriction to Sn−1 is the
regular representation. This is easily seen by taking the partial derivative of fn with
respect to the ﬁrst power-sum symmetric function p1 ([12]). We will need the following
fact about this diﬀerential operator ([12]):

The preceding calculations take on added signiﬁcance when we observe their con-
nection with the operation of Sn on itself by conjugation. This action results in a
permutation representation ψ(Sn) whose orbits are the conjugacy classes of Sn (indexed
by partitions of n); since the centraliser of any element of type λ is a direct product of
wreath products of the form ×iSmi[Ci] if λ has mi parts equal to i, it follows easily that
the degree n term in H[F (t)] is the Frobenius characteristic of the conjugacy action of
Sn on itself, and more speciﬁcally, the degree n term in Hλ[F ] is the characteristic of the
conjugation action on the conjugacy class indexed by the partition λ. Hence we obtain,
as an immediate corollary to (1) above, the following known result, the case G = Sn of
[18]; see also ([20], Solution to Exercise 7.71 (a) and (b)):

pλ =Xν⊢n

completes the proof.

(cid:3)

The conjugation action of Sn on itself has been the subject of several papers ([18], [2],
[17]), and also ([15], 8.6.3). The character of this action was computed more generally
for ﬁnite groups G by Solomon [18]:

Theorem 4.4. ([18]; see also ([20], Solution to Exercise 7.71 (a) and (b))) Let G be
a ﬁnite group. The permutation representation of G acting on itself by conjugation has
the following properties:

over all the conjugacy classes of G.

(1) The multiplicity of the irreducible χ equals the sum PC χ(C) where C ranges
(2) Its character is given by the formula Pχ∈Irr(G) χ ¯χ, where Irr(G) is the set of

irreducible characters of G.

It follows immediately from Solomon’s observation (2) for ﬁnite groups G (see also

e.g., ([12], p. 119, [20], Exercise 7.71) that, in the case of the symmetric group Sn,

Xλ⊢n

THE CONJUGACY ACTION OF Sn AND MODULES INDUCED FROM CENTRALISERS

where ∗ denotes the internal product of symmetric functions, i.e., if V and W are two
Sn-modules with Frobenius characteristics fV and fW respectively, then fV ∗ fW is the
Frobenius characteristic of the inner tensor product module V ⊗ W.

The description of the conjugation action as the coeﬃcient of tn in H[F (t)], i.e., as
a sum of induced modules from centralisers, was used by T. Scharf [17] to give another
proof of a result originally due to A. Frumkin [2] that for n 6= 2, every irreducible
appears in the conjugation action of Sn.

Frumkin’s result is

Theorem 4.5. ([2], [17]) If n 6= 2, every irreducible of Sn appears in ψ(Sn). Equiva-

lently, the character table row-sums Pλ⊢n χν(λ) are positive integers for every partition

ν of n 6= 2.

Now consider the exterior powers in Theorem 4.2: Let ε(Sn) be the representation
Cn .

of Sn whose Frobenius characteristic is the coeﬃcient of tn in E[F (t)] for fn = 1 ↑Sn
Thus

ch(ε(Sn)) = Xλ∈P arn

Eλ[F ] = Xλ⊢n,λ=Qi imiYi

emi[fi].

Equivalently, ε(Sn) is a sum of transitive monomial representations, with orbits indexed
by partitions λ of n, and stabiliser equal to the centraliser of type λ. The action of Sn
is trivial within each cycle, and permutes cycles of the same length according to the
sign representation. Thus ε(Sn) may be considered to be the conjugation action twisted
by the sign. Note that the second statement of the next result, namely, that ε(Sn) is
self-conjugate, is not obvious from the above deﬁnition: the submodules with Frobenius
characteristic Eλ[F ] are not themselves self-conjugate for arbitrary λ.
Theorem 4.6. We have, with fn = ch(1 ↑Sn

(2) ε(Sn) is a self-conjugate representation of Sn of degree n!
(3) If χν is the irreducible Sn-character indexed by the partition ν of n, then for

χν(λ) is a nonnegative integer.

Proof. Part (1) follows from (2) of Theorem 3.2 (with v = 1), by taking the coeﬃcient of
tn in the right-hand side of (2). Part (2) is now immediate, since ω(pi) = (−1)i−1pi and
thus ω ﬁxes pi if i is odd. Hence if λ has all parts odd, pλ is ﬁxed by ω. The statement
about the degree is clear since only p(1n) = pn
1 contributes to the degree (a square-free
term).

Part (3) follows upon writing the expression in (1) in terms of Schur functions. (cid:3)

Computations with Stembridge’s symmetric functions package SF for Maple suggest
that, just as in the case of the conjugation action, every irreducible occurs in ε(Sn).
In order to prove this we will need a lemma about the irreducibles appearing in the
representations 1 ↑Sk
Ck

:

Lemma 4.7. If k is an odd prime, the representation fk = ch(1 ↑Sk
) contains every
Ck
irreducible except for those indexed by (k − 1, 1) and (2, 1k−2). More generally, fn always
contains the trivial representation, and never contains the representation (n − 1, 1), and

16

SHEILA SUNDARAM

contains the representation (1n) (once) if and only if n is odd and (2, 1n−2) (once) if
and only if n is even.
Proof. Note that f2 = h2. We have fk = 1
is prime. Let ν ⊢ k.

1 + (k − 1)pk) since φ(k) = (k − 1) when k

k (pk

Let χν be the irreducible indexed by ν; its degree f ν is the number of standard
Young tableaux of shape ν. Expanding in terms of Schur functions, we have fk =
1

k (Pν f νsν + (k − 1)Pν χν((k)))sν, where we have used the fact that pµ =Pλ χλ(µ)sλ.
r (cid:1) + (k − 1)(−1)r) if

But for the k-cycle (k), it is well-known ([12], [20]) that χν((k)) is nonzero if and only
if ν = (k − r, 1r) is a hook shape, in which case it equals (−1)r. Hence the multiplicity
of the irreducible ν in fk is 1
ν = (k − r, 1r), 0 ≤ r ≤ k − 1. It follows that the trivial and sign representations (r = 0
and r = k − 1 respectively) each occur exactly once, the representation (k − 1, 1) never
occurs, and, because r = k − 2 is odd, the representation (2, 1k−2) never occurs.

k f ν if ν is not a hook, and equals 1

k ((cid:0)k−1

If ν ⊢ k is any partition other than a hook, the multiplicity is given by 1

k f ν. Since
this number is necessarily an integer, and f ν is a positive integer (being the number of
standard Young tableaux of shape ν, or the degree of the irreducible indexed by ν), it
follows that it is nonzero.

The last statement for general n follows from a theorem of Kr´askiewicz and Weyman,
and independently Stanley, ([11], [20], Solution to Exercise 7.88 (b); see also [15], Cor.
8.10) that the multiplicity of the irreducible indexed by λ in fn equals the number of
standard Young tableau with major index congruent to 0 modulo n.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.8. Maple computations with SF in fact indicate that fn contains every
irreducible besides (n−1, 1), (2, 1n−2) and (1n), but this seems considerably more diﬃcult
to prove. (The author is grateful to R. Stanley for verifying this up to n = 29.)

n

Theorem 4.9. The representation ε(Sn) (as well as the representation ψ(Sn) for n 6= 2)
contains every irreducible representation of Sn. In particular, the nonnegative integers

χν(λ) are in fact positive for all partitions ν of n.

Pλ∈P arodd
Proof. Our starting point is the formula ch(ε(Sn)) = Pλ∈P arn Eλ[F ] (recall the deﬁni-

tion of Eλ[H] from the preliminaries in Section 2). We will show that for every partition
λ ∈ P ar, there is a partition τ (λ) of n = |λ| such that the Schur function sλ appears in
the representation Eτ (λ)[H], i.e., such that hsλ, Eτ (λ)[H]i > 0.

First note that fi = hi for i = 1, 2. Also the trivial representation hn = s(n) appears
in fn = E(n)[F ], and the sign representation also appears in ε(Sn) because en = en[f1] =
E(1n)[F ]. Hence we can take τ ((n)) = (n) and τ ((1n)) = (1n). Similarly since s(n−1,1)
appears in the product hn−1h1, which in turn appears in fn−1f1 = e1[fn−1]e1[f1] =
E(n−1,1)[F ] for n ≥ 3, we can take τ ((n − 1, 1)) = (n − 1, 1) for n ≥ 3. Likewise, s(2,1n−2)
appears in e1[f2]en−2[f1] = E(2,1n−2)[F ], so that we may take τ ((2, 1n−2)) = (2, 1n−2)
when n ≥ 3.

We proceed by induction on n = |λ|. The cases n = 0 and n = 1 are trivial. Let
n = 2. Then for λ ⊢ 2, τ (λ) = λ, since h2 = s(2) appears in f2 = e1[f2] = E(2)[F ], and
e2 = s(12) appears in e2 = e2[f1] = E(12)[F ].

The three partitions of n = 3 have already been addressed. Now let n = 4. Here
the ﬁrst new partition is (22). But it is easily checked that there is a standard Young
tableau of shape (22) with major index congruent to 0 modulo 4, and hence s(22) appears
in f4 = e1[f4] = E(4)[F ]. We may therefore take τ ((22)) = (4).

THE CONJUGACY ACTION OF Sn AND MODULES INDUCED FROM CENTRALISERS

17

For n = 5, considering only the partitions we have not already addressed, since 5 is an
odd prime, we have that τ (λ) = λ for every partition λ except (4, 1) and its conjugate
(2, 13).

By induction hypothesis, assume that for every i ≤ n, every partition λ of i admits a

partition τ (λ) of i such that sλ appears in Eτ (λ)[F ]. Let n ≥ 6.

From the preceding discussion, we may assume λ and λt do not equal (n − 1, 1).
By Bertrand’s Postulate (see Theorem 2.5) there is a largest prime q ≥ 5 such that
n/2 < q < n, i.e., n > q > n − q > 1. We claim that there is a partition µ of q such
that µ ⊂ λ and neither µ nor its transpose is of the form (m − 1, 1). Invoking Lemma
4.7, this guarantees that sµ appears in fq = E(q)[F ].

Case 1: If µ is of the form (m − 1, 1), then since n − q > n/2 ≥ 1, and we have
assumed λ 6= (n − 1, 1), we know that all the squares in the skew shape λ/µ cannot be
in row 1; there is at least one square in the skew-shape that is in row 2 or row 3. Hence
we may modify our choice by taking µ = (q − 2, 2) or µ = (q − 2, 12). Both shapes satisfy
our criteria (the second because q 6= 4) and hence the claim.

Case 2: If µt is of the form (m − 1, 1), then again there must be a square in the
skew-shape λ/µ that is in row 2 or row 1; all the squares cannot be at the bottom
because that would force λt = (n − 1, 1). Thus we may modify our choice by taking
µ = (22, 1q−4) or µ = (3, 1q−3). Both shapes satisfy our criteria (the second because
q ≥ 5) and the claim follows.

Next consider the set of partitions ν of n−q such that sλ appears in the product sµsν,
and choose such a ν. Assume ﬁrst that neither ν nor νt is of the form (m−1, 1), m ≥ 2.
Then by induction hypothesis, there is a partition τ (ν) of n − q such that sν appears
in Eτ (ν)[F ]. Also sµ appears in E(q)[F ] = fq by Lemma 4.7 since q is an odd prime.
Hence sλ appears in Eτ (ν)[F ] · E(q)[F ] = Eτ (ν)[F ]fq. But this is just Eτ (ν)∪(q)[F ], since
q > n − q implies that q is distinct from the parts of τ (ν). We have shown that we may
take τ (λ) = τ (ν) ∪ (q). (If m = 1, τ (ν) is just (1)and τ (λ) is the two-part partition
(q, 1).)

Now assume νt is of the form (m−1, 1), m ≥ 2, i.e., ν = (2, 1m−2). Then sν appears in
the product h2em−2[f1] = e1[f2] · em−2[f1]. It follows that sλ appears in E(q)[F ] · E(2)[F ] ·
E(1m−2)[F ], so that we may take τ (λ) = (q, 2, 1m−2). Since q is an odd prime, we have
E(q)[F ] · E(2)[F ] · E(1m−2)[F ] = E(q,2,1m−2)[F ].

Finally assume ν is of the form (m − 1, 1). Clearly sν appears in fm−1f1 where m =

n − q. Again we have two cases.

Case (1a): If m − 1 = n − q − 1 > 1, we have that sλ appears in sµsν and thus in
fqfm−1f1 = E(q,m−1,1), so we may take τ (λ) to be the partition (q, m − 1, 1) and this
has distinct parts since q is an odd prime which is greater than n/2 and 2 ≤ m − 1 =
n − q − 1 < n/2 − 1.

Case (2a): If m = 2, i.e., ν = (12), then sν = e2 appears in e2[f1] = E(12)[F ], and
thus we may take τ (λ) = (q, 12), so that sλ appears in sµe2, which in turn appears in
fqe2 = E(q)[F ] · E(12)[F ] = E(q,12).

This completes the induction, showing that every irreducible appears in ε(Sn).

The proof of Theorem 4.9 can be adapted to give a new proof that ψ(Sn) contains
every irreducible. The remainder of this section is devoted to proving a stronger result.
We start by introducing a new class of representations, motivated primarily by the fact
that the Sn-action on itself by conjugation breaks up into invariant submodules indexed
by partitions λ of n.

For any subset T of partitions of n, deﬁne the representation ψ(Sn, T ) to be the
conjugation action of Sn on permutations whose types lie in T, and similarly the rep-
resentation ε(Sn, T ) to be the twisted conjugation action of Sn on permutations whose
types lie in T. The Frobenius characteristics are thus the Schur-positive symmetric func-

tions ch(ψ(Sn, T )) =Pλ∈T Hλ[F ] and ch(ε(Sn, T )) =Pλ∈T Eλ[F ]. In particular, taking

T as a set to be the alternating subgroup An or its complement, which we denote by
¯An, we have, since the sign of a permutation σ ∈ Sn is given by (−1)n−ℓ(µ) if the type
of σ is the partition µ, we have

We now need a number-theoretic lemma on the distribution of primes that follows

from a result of Nagura [13].

Lemma 4.16. If n ≥ 12 then there is an odd prime q such that n > q > n − q ≥ 5. If
n ≥ 11 or n = 9, there is an odd prime q such that q > n − q ≥ 4.

Proof. Nagura’s theorem [13] states that, for every positive integer m ≥ 25, there is at
least one prime between m and 6m/5, i.e., such that m < p < 6m/5. By iterating this,
as observed in [14], we ﬁnd that

m < p1 < 6m/5 < p2 < 36m/25 < p3 < 216m/125 < 2m.

Hence, for m ≥ 25, there are three distinct primes such that m < p1 < p2 < p3 < 2m.
Putting n = 2m + 1, this gives (n − 1)/2 = m < p1 < p2 < p3 < 2m < n, so that
n/2 = m + 1/2 < m + 1 ≤ p1 < p2 < p3 < 2m < n, while putting n = 2m leads to the
same conclusion. It follows that for n ≥ 50, there are primes p1, p2, p3 such that

n/2 < p1 < p2 < p3 < n.

Setting q = p1, we have n − q = (n − p3) + (p3 − p2) + (p2 − p1) ≥ 1 + 2 + 2 = 5, for

n ≥ 50.

The remaining cases, viz., 12 ≤ n < 50, are easily checked by hand, down to n = 11 :
the prime 7 is less than 11 and greater than 11/2, and 11 − 7 = 4. Similarly q = 5
satisﬁes the requirement for n = 9. Also, if 50 > n ≥ 12, one checks that there is a
prime q, n > q > n/2, such that n − q ≥ 5.

Our next theorem strengthens the fact that the conjugacy action contains every Sn-

irreducible ([2], see Theorem 4.5).

Theorem 4.17. Every Sn-irreducible appears in the conjugacy action on the subset of
even permutations, for n ≥ 4. Also every Sn-irreducible except the sign, appears in the
conjugacy action on the set of odd permutations, for n ≥ 2.

Equivalently: For every partition λ ⊢ n, the Schur function sλ appears

all n ≥ 4;

(1) in the (Schur-positive) symmetric function ch ψ(Sn, An) =P µ⊢n
(2) in the (Schur-positive) symmetric function ch ψ(Sn, ¯An) =P µ⊢n

cept for λ = (1n), which never appears when n ≥ 2.

Hµ[F ], ex-

n−ℓ(µ)odd

Hµ[F ] for

n−ℓ(µ)even

Proof. Note that the sign representation will appear in Hµ[F ] if and only if µ has distinct
odd parts, since fn contains the sign if and only if n is odd. But n − ℓ(µ) is necessarily
even for such a µ. Hence the sign representation appears only in ψ(Sn, An).

We will use an induction argument as in the proof of Theorem 4.9. However, because

the sign representation does not appear in ψ(Sn, ¯An), we will need Lemma 4.16.

Maple computations with SF show that the statement of the theorem holds for n ≤ 12.
The resulting decompositions into irreducibles of ψ(Sn, An) and ψ(Sn, ¯An) are recorded
in Table 3, where we have denoted by λ the Sn-irreducible indexed by the partition λ.
Our induction hypothesis will be that for ﬁxed n ≥ 12, whenever 4 ≤ k < n, and k6=
2,3, for every partition λ of k, λ 6= (1k), there are partitions τ (λ) and σ(λ) of k such
that ℓ(τ (λ)) is even, ℓ(σ(λ)) is odd, and sλ appears in both Hτ (λ)[F ] and Hσ(λ)[F ]. For
λ = (1k) we know there is a partition τ (λ) such that k − τ (λ) is even and sλ appears in
Hτ (λ)[F ].

It is convenient to address the extreme cases ﬁrst. We have

(1) Let λ = (n). Then we may always take τ (λ) = (n) because s(n) appears in
H(n)[F ] = fn which contains hn. Similarly we may take σ(λ) to be (n − 1, 1),
because if H(n−1,1)[F ] = fn−1f1 if n ≥ 3, contains hn−1h1, which in turn con-
tains hn. This includes the case n = 2, for then we have σ(λ) = (12) and
H(12)[F ] = h2[f1] = h2. When n = 3, the two partitions (2, 1) and (13) sat-
isfy the required conditions:Hσ(λ)[F ] = f2f1 or h3[f1]. We have shown that s(n)
appears in ch ψ(Sn, An) and in ch ψ(Sn, ¯An) for all n.

(2) Let λ = (1n). Take τ (λ) = (n) if n is odd, so that Hτ [F ] = fn, and τ (λ) =
(n − 1, 1) if n is even, n 6= 2, so that Hτ [F ] = fn−1f1, . In each case, since fm
contains the sign representation for odd m, s(1n) appears in Hτ [F ]; if n is odd,
n − ℓ(τ ) = n − 1 is even, and if n is even, n − ℓ(τ ) = n − 2 is again even. Hence
s(1n) appears in Hτ [F ], n 6= 2, with even n − ℓ(τ ), i.e., in ch ψ(Sn, An), n 6= 2.

(3) Let λ = (n − 1, 1). Provided n ≥ 4, we may take τ (λ) to be (n − 1, 1) and σ(λ) to
be (n − 2, 12). In the ﬁrst case H(n−1,1)[F ] = fn−1f1 which contains hn−1h1 and
hence contains s(n−1,1); in the second case (since n−2 > 1) H(n−2,12)[F ] = fn−2h2
contains hn−2h2, which in turn contains s(n−1,1). If n = 3 we can take τ = (2, 1),
and then s(2,1) appears in Hτ [F ] = f2f1 = h2h1, i.e., in ch ψ(S3, S3\A3) but
not in ch ψ(S3, A3). Hence s(n−1,1) appears in ch ψ(Sn, An) for n ≥ 4 and in
ch ψ(Sn, ¯An) for n ≥ 3.

THE CONJUGACY ACTION OF Sn AND MODULES INDUCED FROM CENTRALISERS

23

(4) Let λ = (2, 1n−2). Since fr contains the sign representation if and only if r is

odd, it follows that
(a) If n is odd, we may take τ (λ) = (n − 2, 2) and σ(τ ) = (n − 2, 12), n ≥ 4 (the

case n = 3 has been addressed above);

(b) If n is even, we may take τ (λ) = (n − 1, 1) and σ(λ) = (n) for n ≥ 2;
because by Lemma 4.7, s(2,1n−2) appears in H(n)[F ] = fn whenever n is
even, in which case n − ℓ((n)) is odd.

Hence s(2,1n−2) appears in ch ψ(Sn, An) if n ≥ 4, and in ch ψ(Sn, ¯An) if n ≥ 3.

Now let n ≥ 12, and let λ be any partition of n other than (1n), (n−1, 1) and (2, 1n−2).
By Lemma 4.16 there is a prime q such that q > n − q ≥ 5. We claim that because
λ, λt 6= (n − 1, 1), we can choose a partition µ ⊂ λ such that µ, µt 6= (|µ| − 1, 1). Hence,
invoking Lemma 4.7, this guarantees that sµ appears in fq = H(q)[F ] for the odd prime
q.

Case (a): If µ is of the form (m − 1, 1), then since n − q > n/2 ≥ 1, and we have assumed
λ 6= (n − 1, 1), we know that all the squares in the skew shape λ/µ cannot be
in row 1; there is at least one square in the skew-shape that is in row 2 or row
3. Hence we may modify our choice by taking µ = (q − 2, 2) or µ = (q − 2, 12),
noting that q −2 ≥ 3. Both shapes satisfy our criteria (the second because q 6= 4)
and hence the claim.

Case (b): If µt is of the form (m − 1, 1), then again there must be a square in the skew-
shape λ/µ that is in row 2 or row 1; all the squares cannot be at the bottom
because that would force λt = (n − 1, 1). Thus we may modify our choice by
taking µ = (22, 1q−4) or µ = (3, 1q−3). Both shapes satisfy our criteria (the
second because q ≥ 5) and the claim follows.

Now consider the set of partitions ν of n − q such that sλ appears in the product

sµsν, and choose such a partition ν.

Case 1: Assume ﬁrst that neither ν nor νt is of the form (m − 1, 1), and ν 6= (1m). By
induction hypothesis there are partitions τ (ν) and σ(ν) of even and odd length
respectively such that sν appears in Hτ (ν)[F ] and Hσ(ν)[F ]. Hence sλ appears in
H(q)∪τ (ν)[F ] and in H(q)∪σ(ν)[F ]. (Again q > (n − 2)/2 implies that q is distinct
from the parts of τ (ν) and σ(ν). ) Since the partitions (q) ∪ τ (ν) and (q) ∪ σ(ν)
have lengths of opposite parity, we are done.

Case 2: Now suppose νt = (m − 1, 1), i.e., ν = (2, 1m−2). From (4) above, since m =
n − q ≥ 5, we can ﬁnd partitions τ (ν) and σ(ν) with lengths of opposite parity
such that sν appears in both Hτ (ν)[F ] and Hσ(ν)[F ]. Then as before, since sµ
appears in H(q)[F ], it follows that sλ appears in H(q)∪τ (ν)[F ] and H(q)∪σ(ν)[F ],
and since one part distinct from all the others, namely q > n − q, was added
to both partitions, again we have partitions with lengths of opposite parity, as
claimed.

Case 3: Here we consider the case ν = (m − 1, 1) = (n − q − 1, 1). Since m = n − q ≥ 5,
from (3) above we have two partitions τ and σ of opposite parity such that Hτ [F ]
and Hσ[F ] contain sν.

Case 4: Suppose ν = (1m). Then sν appears in Hτ [F ] but only for some τ such that
|τ | − ℓ(τ ) = m − ℓ(τ ) is even. The argument is therefore more involved. Note
ﬁrst that if sλ appears in sµ · s(1m) for some µ of q, it must also appear in the
product sµ′ · s(2,1m−2) for some partition µ′ of q. (Recall that m = n − q ≥ 5.)

24

SHEILA SUNDARAM

This follows by observing that (1m) ⊂ λ, and recalling that λ 6= (1n). Since fq
contains all partitions of q except (q − 1, 1) and (2, 1q−2), the discussion in Case
2 and the preceding cases implies that it suﬃces to consider the following two
sub-cases for the partition µ′:

Case 4-1: Assume µ′ = (q − 1, 1). In this case we know from (3) above that sµ′
appears in H(q−1,1)[F ] = fq−1f1, in H(q−2,12)[F ] = fq−2h2[f1], as well as
in H(q−2,2)[F ] = fq−2f2, the latter because q − 2 > 2 and fq−2 contains hq−2.
Now let m be even. Then (4(b)) implies that s(2,1m−2) appears in H(m)[F ] =
fm and hence, taking τ (λ) = (q − 2, 12) ∪ (m), since q − 2 6= m (q is odd
and m is even), we have an even-length partition (into four parts) such
that Hτ (λ)[F ] = fq−2fmh2[f1] contains sµ′s(2,1m−2) and hence contains sλ.
Similarly taking σ(λ) = (q − 2, 2) ∪ (m) produces an odd-length partition
(into three distinct parts: q − 2 6= m because q is odd and m is even) such
that Hσ(λ)[F ] = fq−2f2fm contains sλ.
Next suppose m is odd. Then from (4(a)) we know that s(2,1m−2) appears
in H(m−2,2)[F ] = fm−2f2 and H(m−2,12)[F ] = fm−2h2[f1]. Taking τ = (q −
2, 12) ∪ (m − 2, 2), and noting that q − 2 > m − 2 > 2, (here we are using
the hypothesis about q that m = n − q ≥ 5) we see that Hτ [F ] contains sλ
and τ has odd length. Similarly noting that q − 1 > m − 1 > m − 2 > 2, we
see that the even-length partition σ = (q − 1, 1) ∪ (m − 2, 2) has the same
property: Hσ[F ] contains sλ. This settles the case µ′ = (q − 1, 1).

Case 4-2: Assume µ′ = (2, 1q−2).

µs(2,1m−2) and hence contain sλ.

First let m be even. Invoking (4(b)), we see again (note that q is odd and
m is even, so q − 2 6= m) that the partitions τ = (q − 2, 2) ∪ (m) and σ =
(q − 2, 12) ∪ (m) have opposite parity and both Hτ [F ] = fq−2f2fm, Hσ[F ] =
fq−2h2[f1] contain s′
Now let m be odd. Then we can take τ = (q − 2, 2) ∪ (m − 2, 12) to
obtain an odd-length partition such that Hτ [F ] = fq−2f2fm−2h2[f1] contains
sµ′s(2,1m−2). Observe also that since q−1 is even,by Lemma 4.7, sµ′ = s(2,1q−2)
appears in fq−1h1 = H(q−1,1). Hence since q − 1 > m − 1 > m − 2, we may in
addition take σ = (q − 1, 1) ∪ (m − 2, 2) for the even length partition such
that Hσ[F ] = fq−1f1fm−2f2 contains sµ′s(2,1m−2).

This ﬁnishes the inductive step, and hence the proof is complete.

n contains every irreducible of Sn. Equivalently,

We also have the analogous strengthening of Theorem 4.9:

Theorem 4.19. Every Sn-irreducible appears in the twisted conjugacy action on the
subset of even permutations, for n ≥ 5. Also every Sn-irreducible except the sign, appears
in the twisted conjugacy action on the set of odd permutations, for n ≥ 2.
Equivalently: For every partition λ ⊢ n, the Schur function sλ appears

Proof. Note that Hµ[F ] and Eµ[F ] coincide when µ is a partition with distinct parts.
Thus, in the proof of Theorem 4.17, we need to examine, and possibly modify the
argument in the places where the discussion involves partitions with repeated parts.

First, as before, in Table 4 we record the decomposition into irreducibles for n ≤ 12.
Writing simply λ for the Sn-irreducible indexed by the partition λ, Maple computation
with SF shows that although the irreducible indexed by (22) does not appear in ε(S4, A4),
for (12 ≥) n ≥ 5 εn(Sn, An) contains all irreducibles, while εn(Sn, ¯An) contains all
irreducibles except the sign for (12 ≥) n ≥ 4.

Our induction hypothesis will be that for ﬁxed n ≥ 12, whenever 5 ≤ k < n, (so in
particular k6= 2,3,4), for every partition λ 6= (1k) of k, there are partitions τ (λ) and
σ(λ) of k such that ℓ(τ (λ)) is even, ℓ(σ(λ)) is odd, and sλ appears in both Eτ (λ)[F ] and
Eσ(λ)[F ]. When λ = (1n), we will show that it appears only in Eτ (λ)[F ] for some τ such
that n − ℓ(τ (λ)) is even.

(1) Let λ = (n). Then τ = (n) and σ = (n − 1, 1) are partitions with lengths of
opposite parity such that s(n) appears in Eτ [F ] and Eσ[F ], for n ≥ 3. For n = 2,
we have E(2)[F ] = f2 = h2. Hence (n) appears in ε(Sn, ¯An) for all n ≥ 2, and in
ε(Sn, An) if n ≥ 3.

(2) Let λ = (1n). Clearly the sign representation s(1n) appears in E(1n)[F ] = en[f1] =
en, and n − ℓ((1n)) is even, so it appears in ε(Sn, An). More generally, the sign
representation cannot appear in Eλ[F ] if λ has an even part, since for fn contains
the sign only if n is odd. But if all parts of λ are odd, then n − ℓ(λ) is necessarily
even. Hence the sign appears only in ε(Sn, An) and never in ε(Sn, ¯An) (n ≥ 2).
(3) Let λ = (n − 1, 1). Again for n ≥ 4, we may take τ (λ) = (n − 1, 1) and σ(λ) =
(n − 2, 12). In the ﬁrst case E(n−1,1)[F ] = fn−1f1 as before, in the second case
E(n−2,12)[F ] = fn−2e2[f1] = fn−2e2, which contains h(n−2)e2 and hence contains
sλ. If n = 3, s(2,1) appears in Eσ[F ] only for σ = (2, 1). Then n − ℓ(σ) = 1
is odd, and E(2,1)[F ] contains f2f1 = s(3) + s(2,1). Hence (2, 1) appears only in
ε(S3, S3\A3), but for n ≥ 4, (n − 1, 1) appears in both representations.

(4) Let λ = (2, 1n−2). Since fr contains the sign representation if and only if r is

odd, it follows that
(a) If n is odd, we may take τ (λ) = (n − 2, 2), n − 2 > 2 (because then
Eτ [F ] = fn−2h2 which contains en−2h2) and σ(τ ) = (n − 2, 12), n ≥ 4
(because Eσ[F ] = fn−2e2 which now contains en−2e2, which also contains
s(2,1n−2)). (The case n = 3 has been addressed above.);

(b) If n is even, we may take τ (λ) = (n − 1, 1) and σ(λ) = (n) for n ≥ 2;
because the sign appears in fn−1 and, by Lemma 4.7, s(2,1n−2) appears in
E(n)[F ] = fn whenever n is even, in which case n − ℓ((n)) is odd.

Hence (2, 1n−2) appears in ψ(Sn, An) if n ≥ 4, and in ψ(Sn, ¯An) if n ≥ 3.

We claim that the rest of the proof of Theorem 4.17 applies almost verbatim, with
all H’s replaced by E’s. Our ﬁrst observation is that Hµ[F ] = Eµ[F ] when µ has
distinct parts. Consequently, it is the two subcases of Case 4 that require additional
scrutiny. In both these cases, the analysis involves partitions in which the part equal
to 1 occurs with multiplicity 2. For Case 4-1, the claim that needs to be veriﬁed is

26

SHEILA SUNDARAM

that sµ′ = s(q−1,1) appears in Eq−2,12[F ], which is now equal to fq−2e2[h1] = fq−2e2. But
this is clear since fq−2 contains hq−2. When m is odd, we need to check that s(2,1m−2)
appears in E(m−2,12)[F ] = fm−2e2, but this has already been veriﬁed in (4(a)) above.
Similarly, in Case 4-2, we need to verify the claim that sµ′ = s(2,1q−2) appears in
E(q−2,12)[F ] = fq−2e2. Once again, since q is odd, this has already been established in
(4(a)) above.

The remaining parts of the proof of Theorem 4.17 pose no diﬃculty in the passage
(cid:3)

from H[F ] to E[F ], and our proof is complete.

Remark 4.20. By a similar combination of number-theoretic and combinatorial ar-
guments, and careful analysis of Ferrers diagrams, we can show that there is a single
conjugacy class with the property that the conjugacy action of Sn on this class contains
every Sn-irreducible. This is also true for the twisted conjugacy action. The proof will
appear elsewhere.

From the Frobenius characteristic one can extract, by routine plethystic computations
as in [21], more precise information about the multiplicities of other irreducibles in
ψ(Sn). We state without proof:

Proposition 4.21. The multiplicity in ψ(Sn)

(1) of the trivial representation is p(n), the number of partitions of n;
(2) of the sign representation is |P ar6=
of whose parts are distinct and odd.

n ∩ P arodd

n |, the number of partitions of n all

(3) of the irreducible indexed by (n − 1, 1) is Pλ⊢n(|{i : mi(λ) ≥ 1}| − 1).

(4) of the irreducible indexed by (2, 1n−2) is

n ∩P arodd

(ℓ(λ) − 1)

Pλ∈P ar6=
+ P(|{i : mi(λ) ≥ 1}|), where the second sum runs over the set of partitions

: mi(λ) ≤ 2, mj(λ) = 2 for exactly one part j.

λ ∈ P arodd

n

n

Proposition 4.22. The trivial representation and the sign representation each occur in
ε(Sn) as many times as there are partitions of n with all parts odd, which is the same as
the number of partitions of n with distinct parts. The irreducible indexed by (n − 1, 1)
(as well as the irreducible indexed by (2, 1n−2)) occurs in ε(Sn) with multiplicity
(ℓ(λ) − 1) + |{µ ⊢ n : mi(µ) ≤ 2 ∀i, mj(µ) = 2 for exactly one j}|.

We end this section by considering one more class of representations. For any ﬁxed

Theorem 4.23. Wn,k is Schur-positive.

Thus it suﬃces to consider the case n = mk. Deﬁne αk = pk

1 + pk.
Using the fact that pk is an alternating sum of Schur functions indexed by hooks, i.e.,
r=0(−1)rs(k−r,1r), we see that αk and βk are both Schur-positive, since f ν ≥ 1

1 − pk, βk = pk

pk = Pk−1

It follows that Wmk,k is a linear combination of Schur functions with coeﬃcients that are
nonnegative and rational. But we already know that the coeﬃcients must be integers,
and hence Wmk,k must be Schur-positive.

5. The Lie and Foulkes characters

In this section we will consider the more general characters obtained by inducing any
nth root of unity from a cyclic subgroup Cn of order n up to Sn. For ﬁxed k ≥ 1, Foulkes
showed [3] that the Frobenius characteristic of the induced representation (e
Cn is
given by fn = 1

where (d, k) denotes the greatest common divisor of d and k as usual. The case k = n
(or k = 0) corresponds to the conjugation action of Section 4.

Now let k = 1. Then ψ1(d) = µ(d), where µ is the number-theoretic M¨obius function,
Cn) is the Frobenius characteristic of the represen-
and (see [15], [19]) fn = ch((e

while fn(t) is the dimension of the nth graded piece of the free Lie algebra on t gen-
erators. Also ([19]) πn = ωLien is the Sn-representation on the unique nonvanishing

homology of the partition lattice Πn. Let πalt = Pi≥1(−1)i−1πi. Part (2) below was

observed by direct calculation in [7].

Lemma 5.1. We have

(1) fn(1) = 0 unless n = 1, in which case it is 1.
(2) fn(−1) = (−1)δn,1 + (1)δn,2; i.e., f1(−1) = −1, f2(−1) = 1, and fn(−1) equals

zero otherwise.

28

SHEILA SUNDARAM

Proof. Part (1) is a standard property of the M¨obius function. Part (2) follows from
Lemma 3.3 applied to ψ(d) = µ(d), the M¨obius function, since if n is even, f2n(1) = 0,
and fn/2(1) is nonzero if and only if n = 2, in which case it is 1.
(cid:3)

By applying Theorem 3.2 with v = 1 to this class of functions fn, we immediately
obtain the generating functions below. The ﬁrst generating function in Corollary 5.2 is
classical; it is essentially the statement of the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem, see [15]
for an exhaustive literature. Part (2) is Cadogan’s formula ([1], [6], ([20], solution to
Problem 7.88 for the calculation in this context) ). It also has a topological connection,
arising as a consequence of the Whitney homology of the partition lattice ([21], [22]).
Part (3) appears in a recent paper ([7]),where the authors derive it by direct calculation
for the special case of the Lie character.

Corollary 5.2. We have the following plethystic generating functions:

(1) (PBW) H[L(t)] =

1

(1 − th1)

(2) (Cadogan) H[πalt(t)] = 1 + th1 = πalt(t)[H].

(3) ([7]) E[L(t)] =Qj≥1(1 − tjpj)fj(−1) =

1 − t2p2
1 − tp1

Proof. Combine Theorem 3.2, (1) to (3), and the calculation recorded in Part (1) of
Lemma 6.1.
(cid:3)

Contrast the next observation with Theorem 4.9 of the preceding section regarding

the exterior powers of the conjugation action, in which every irreducible appears.

Corollary 5.3. The degree n term in H[L] is the regular representation, and thus
contains every irreducible of Sn. The degree n term in E[L] is 2pn−2
e2, a representation
of degree n! which contains every irreducible except the trivial representation.

Proof. A simple calculation shows that the degree n term of E[L(t)] is 2pn−2
hence the result.

e2, and
(cid:3)

The fourth consequence of Theorem 3.2 is of special importance; we will apply it to

the results of the previous section. We have

Proof. Combine Theorem 3.2, (4) and Part (2) of Lemma 6.1.

Proposition 5.4. E[πalt(t)] =Qj≥1(1 + tjpj)−fj(−1) =
Now suppose F = Pn≥1 fn and G = 1 +Pn≥1 gn are formal series of symmetric

functions, as usual with fn, gn being of homogeneous degree n.

THE CONJUGACY ACTION OF Sn AND MODULES INDUCED FROM CENTRALISERS

29

Proof. Cadogan’s formula says that πalt is the plethystic inverse of (H − 1). It follows
that

(H − 1)[F ] = G − 1 ⇐⇒ F = πalt[G − 1]

⇐⇒ E[F ] = (E[πalt])[G − 1] =

1 + p1
1 + p2

[G − 1] =

Now substitute G = H[F ] in the right-hand side above. Since plethysm is associative

and commutes with power-sums, we have

(cid:18)p1
p2(cid:19) [G] =(cid:18)p1

p2(cid:19) [H[F ]] =(cid:18)(cid:18) p1

p2(cid:19) [H](cid:19) [F ] =(cid:18)H[

which establishes the claim.

p1
p2

](cid:19) [F ] = H[(cid:18)p1

p2(cid:19) [F ]],

(cid:3)

Thus in general, when F is a series of Schur-positive symmetric functions, so that
H[F ] = G is also Schur-positive, there is another series F/F [p2] whose symmetric
powers equal G. We note however that F/F [p2] is not always Schur-positive. However
we clearly have

Corollary 5.6. If F and G = H[F ] are Schur-positive, then so is G/G[p2].

Note that Part (3) of Corollary 5.2 now follows as a consequence of Lemma 5.4.
We move on to the case of general k and the function ψk(d) given by equation (5.0.1).

Following Hardy and Wright ([9], pp. 55-56) we deﬁne Ramanujan’s sum

cd(k) = X1≤h≤d

(h,d)=1

exp(2iπhk/d) =

ρ a primitive dth root of unity

X

ρk.

Then we have, with the notation of equation (5.0.1), the following remarkable formula
of H¨older:

Theorem 5.7. ([5], see also [9], Theorems 271 and 272 for proofs)

cd(k) = φ(d)

where the last sum ranges over all the nth roots of unity, since every nth root of unity is
a primitive dth root of unity for a unique divisor d of n. The result now follows because
the nth roots of unity are the zeros of (1 − xn), and if k is not a multiple of n, then
the kth powers of the nth roots are simply a rearrangement of the (n, k)th roots, each
occurring

a multiplicity-free nonnegative integer combination of power-sums.

Proof. All parts follow from the corresponding parts of Theorem 3.2. Parts (1) and (3)
use the calculation of fn(1) in Lemma 5.7; Parts (2) and (4) use the value of fn(−1)
from Lemma 5.7. Equation (5.9.8) follows by applying the involution ω to Equation
(5.9.7). Note that the right-hand side of (5.9.8) is now a nonnegative linear combination
of power-sums.
(cid:3)

By combining (5.9.1) and (5.9.8) as in Theorem 3.4, we obtain more linear combina-
tions of power-sums that are Schur-positive. The same statement applies to adding and
subtracting (5.9.5) and (5.9.6).

Note also that when k is prime, equation (5.9.1) coincides with the symmetric function
Wn,k of Theorem 4.23, thereby providing a concrete realisation of the representation.
In particular when k = 2 we obtain, for the symmetric function Wn,2 which is a homo-
geneous polynomial of degree n in the power-sums p1 and p2 :
Corollary 5.10. Let fn be the Frobenius characteristic of the representation exp (4πi/n) ↑Sn

. Then

and the following polynomials in the power-sums p1, p2 and p4 are Schur-positive:

(1 + p1)(1 − p4)−1|deg n = gn =Pµ⊢n(−1)n−ℓ(µ)Hµ[F ],

A similar statement can be made for the case of odd prime k.

6. The alternating group

In this section we examine yet another representation of Sn with the same degree as
the regular representation. Consider the alternating group An operating on itself by
conjugation, a representation of degree n!/2 which we denote by ψ(An). When induced
up to Sn it gives a representation ψ(An) ↑Sn
An of degree n!. Before we prove our next
result, we investigate this situation in more generality.

Proposition 6.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group and H a subgroup of G of index 2 (hence
normal). Fix g0 /∈ H, so that G = H ∪ g0H is a disjoint union of left cosets. Let
ψ(H) denote the action of H on itself by conjugation, and consider the G-dimensional

the action ψ(G) of G on itself by conjugation. Then
(1) H and g0H are disjoint orbits for this action.
(2) Hence if ψ(G, H), ψ(G, g0H) denote respectively the actions of G by conjugation

on H and g0H, we have

ψ(G) = ψ(G, H) ⊕ ψ(G, g0H).

(3) The character values of ψ(G, H) and ψ(G, g0H); on τ ∈ G are equal to |Z(τ )∩H|

and |Z(τ ) ∩ g0H| respectively.

(4) Let ωH denote the one-dimensional representation of G induced by the unique
nontrivial one-dimensional representation of the quotient group G/H (which is
cyclic of order 2), with character χωH (g)

H is a G-submodule of ψ(G) ⊕ ωH ⊗ ψ(G). In fact if we deﬁne U +

G = ψ(G, H) + ωH ⊗ ψ(G, g0H).

Proof. For (1)and (2): this is clear, since H is normal in G and gxg−1 ∈ H ⇐⇒ x ∈
g−1Hg = H, and hence g(g0h)g−1 ∈ g0H for all h ∈ H.

For (3): Let τ ∈ G. We compute the trace of τ acting on H by conjugation:
tr (τ |H) = |{h ∈ H : τ hτ −1 = h}| = |{h ∈ H : τ h = hτ }| = |Z(τ ) ∩ H|

and similarly for τ acting on g0H by conjugation: tr τ |g0H = |Z(τ ) ∩ g0H|.

For (4): From the trace of τ acting on H it follows that the character value of τ on
the representation ψ(G, H) ⊕ (ωH ⊗ ψ(G, H)) equals (1 + χ(ωH)(τ )) · |Z(τ ) ∩ H| which
in turn equals

(0,

τ /∈ H, since then χ(ωH)(τ ) = −1

ωH ⊗ ωH is the trivial representation of G.

The second statement follows since

For (5): This follows immediately from (2) and (4).
The statement in (6) is immediate upon substituting from (2) and (4), since ψ(G) +
G = 2ψ(G, H), with the analogous result when we tensor with ωH. Statement (7)

follows by using the deﬁnition of U +

Now we apply this to the alternating subgroup An of Sn. For σ in Sn, if σ has cycle-

Let σ ∈ Sn be of cycle-type λ ⊢ n. We claim that the centraliser Z(σ) contains an
odd permutation if and only if some part i is even, or all parts i are odd but some odd
part is repeated. But the natural embedding of Sa[Sb] in Sab (e.g., [10]) shows that
there are odd permutations in the wreath product subgroup Sa[Sb] if and only if b is

the conclusion follows.
(cid:3)

Hence we have:

Proof. We use Proposition 4.13. Equation (6.5.1) follows from Theorem 6.4. Equation
(6.5.2) is just a matter of putting together equations (4.13.5) and (4.13.2) of Proposition
4.13, and equation (6.5.1) above. (6.5.3) is simply (6) of Proposition 6.2, coupled with
the fact that U DO

Finally, Equation (6.5.4) follows by eliminating ψ(An) ↑Sn from equations (6.5.3) and

(6.5.2), or directly from Proposition 6.2 (5)-(7).

The irreducible representations of An are determined essentially from Cliﬀord theory
for the special case of a ﬁnite group G with a subgroup H of index 2. The results are
summarised below, although we have not been able to ﬁnd an explicit reference.

Theorem 6.6. (see [4], Proposition 5.1) Let G be a ﬁnite group with a subgroup H
of index 2. Let ωH be the linear character induced by G/H as in Proposition 6.2. Let
Irr(G) (respectively Irr(H)) denote the irreducible characters of G (respectively H).
Let χ ∈ Irr(G). Then

(1) If χ(g) 6= 0 for some g /∈ H, then χ and ωH · χ ∈ Irr(G), and χ ↓H = ωH · χ ↓H

is also an irreducible for H.

(2) If χ(g) = 0 for all g /∈ H, then χ ↓H is a sum of two irreducible characters χ+

and χ− in H.

(3) All irreducibles of H arise in this manner.
(4) If ψ ∈ Irr(H), there exists χ ∈ Irr(G) such that ψ is an irreducible component
of χ ↓H, or equivalently, such that χ is an irreducible component of ψ ↑G . In this
case either χ ↓H is irreducible so it equals ψ, or χ ↓H splits into two irreducibles,
and then ψ is either χ+ or χ−.

(5) Let W be any representation of H. Suppose W decomposes into H-irreducibles

as

W =

Xχ∈Irr(G)

χ(g)6=0 for some g /∈H

cχχ + Xχ∈Irr(G)

χ(g)=0 for all g /∈H

d+(χ+) + d−(χ−),

where in the ﬁrst sum we take exactly one of χ, ωH · χ. Then W ↑G
into G irreducibles as

H decomposes

Xχ∈Irr(G)

χ(g)6=0 for some g /∈H

cχ(χ + ωH · χ) + Xχ∈Irr(G)

χ(g)=0 for all g /∈H

(d+ + d−)χ,

where in the ﬁrst sum we take exactly one of χ, ωH · χ.

Corollary 6.7. Let G be a ﬁnite group with a subgroup H of index 2. Let W be a
representation of H. Then W contains every irreducible of H if and only if the induced
representation W ↑G

H contains every irreducible of G.

Proof. Immediate from (5) of the preceding Theorem 6.5.

(cid:3)

In the special case of the alternating group we immediately obtain, from Theorem

6.4 and Corollary 6.6, the following known result:

Corollary 6.8. The conjugacy action of An on itself contains every (An-)irreducible
for n 6= 3.

The preceding corollary is also a consequence of the following deep result of Heide,

Saxl, Tiep and Zalesski:

Theorem 6.9. ([8], Corollary 1.4) If G is a ﬁnite nonabelian simple group, then every
G-irreducible appears in the conjugation action of G on itself.

Hence we have

36

SHEILA SUNDARAM

Theorem 6.10. If G is a ﬁnite group and H is a subgroup of index 2 which is nonabelian
and simple, then the conjugacy action of H on itself, when induced up to G, contains
every G-irreducible.

We conclude with some natural questions raised by this section, in analogy with the

results established for the symmetric group.

Question 6.11. Given a group G with a subgroup H of index 2, we know (Proposition
6.2) that ψ(G) decomposes into a direct sum ψ(G, H) ⊕ ψ(G, g0H). If ψ(G) contains
every G-irreducible, is this also true for the submodules ψ(G, H), ψ(G, g0H) (the ana-
logues of Sn acting by conjugation on the subsets of even and odd permutations), and
the representations U +

G deﬁned in Proposition 6.2?
