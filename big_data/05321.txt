Abstract

Recently it has been established that given an invertible frame multiplier with
semi-normalized symbol, a speciﬁc dual of any of the two involved frames can be
determined for the inversion purpose. The inverse can be represented as a multiplier
with the reciprocal symbol, this particular dual of one of the given frames, and any
dual of the other frame. The speciﬁc dual is the only one having this property
among all Bessel sequences.

In this manuscript we extend the results showing that the speciﬁc dual with the
above mentioned property is unique among all possible sequences. Furthermore,
the symbol is allowed to be not necessarily semi-normalized. Finally we character-
ize cases when the canonical dual frame and the new speciﬁc dual frame coincide.

Introduction

For a representation of functions, beside orthonormal bases, other options like Riesz
bases [7] or frames [12] exist. Riesz bases extend orthonormal bases giving up with the
orthonormality restrictions, but still providing unique representations. Frames extend
Riesz bases giving up with the basis-property and allow redundant representations. The
redundancy is very desirable in applications, for example in signal processing [10], in
particular for noise reduction [8] or signal modiﬁcation [18]. A natural way to modify
functions is ﬁrst to transform them (via some frame), then multiply the resulting coef-
ﬁcients with a ﬁxed scalar sequence, and then transform back into the original domain
via the same or another frame. The operators used to do such a modiﬁcation are called
multipliers. They are of big importance both in mathematics [1, 13, 4] and applications
[5, 27, 17, 19]. The invertibility of such operators is also of mathematical and practical
interest. In this paper we deal with the question on how to represent the inverse as a
multiplier involving appropriate dual frames of the given ones.

D. T. STOEVA AND P. BALAZS

Riesz multipliers with semi normalized symbols are always invertible and the inverse
can be written as a multiplier with the reciprocal symbol and the canonical dual frames
[2]. Considering the more general case of frame multipliers with semi-normalized sym-
bols, invertibility is not always the case and even in the case of invertibility, the above
mentioned way of inversion does not necessarily work, though it is still possible in certain
cases. Investigation of the frame multiplier case was done in [6] where formulas for the
inverse were determined involving appropriate dual frames of the given ones. Uniqueness
of these dual frames was established among the set of the Bessel sequences. A step fur-
ther, the SampTA-proceedings [26] was devoted to the investigation of frame multipliers
where the symbol is not necessarily semi-normalized and non-Bessel sequences were also
involved in the consideration. The results there were announced without proofs. This
paper is an extension of [26]. Here we give proofs of the results, as well as provide new
results related to characterization of frame multiplier cases where the inversion can be
done using precisely the formula from the Riesz multiplier case.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the existing and motivating
results regarding the particular unique duals involved in representing the inverse multi-
plier. These results are related to semi-normalized symbols and the assumption of Bessel
sequences. The section also points to the main questions, concerning generalizations of
the existing results, which are treated in the later sections. In Section 3 the assumption
of Bessel sequences is lifted. In Section 4 not necessarily semi-normalized symbols are
considered. And ﬁnally in Section 5 we comment on and characterize cases when the
formula for representing the inverse of a Riesz multiplier, using the canonical duals, hold
for redundant frame multipliers.

Basic Deﬁnitions, Notation, and Known Facts
Throughout the paper, H denotes a separable Hilbert space, (en)∞n=1 - an orthonormal
basis of H, Φ (resp. Ψ) - a sequence (φn)∞n=1 (resp. (ψn)∞n=1) with elements from H, m -
a complex scalar sequence (mn)∞n=1, m - the sequence (mn)∞n=1 consisting of the complex
conjugates of the elements of m, 1/m - the sequence (1/mn)∞n=1, mΦ - the sequence
(mnφn)∞n=1.

The sequence m is called semi-normalized if there exist a, b so that 0 < a ≤ |mn| ≤
b < ∞ for all n ∈ N. The term operator is used with the meaning of a linear mapping;
an operator L : H → H is called invertible if it is bounded and bijective.
For extensive presentation on frames we refer to [9, 11, 14, 15]. Recall some needed
deﬁnitions and facts from frame theory.

The sequence Φ is called

- a Bessel sequence in H if there exists B ∈ (0,∞) so that P∞n=1 |hf, φni|2 ≤ Bkfk2
for all f ∈ H;
- a frame for H if it is a Bessel sequence in H and there exists A ∈ (0,∞) so that
Akfk2 ≤ P∞n=1 |hf, φni|2 for all f ∈ H;
- a Riesz basis for H if it is both a frame for H and a Schauder basis for H.

Two frames Φ and Ψ for H are called equivalent when there exists an invertible operator
L : H → H mapping φn to ψn, n ∈ N.
A frame (fn)∞n=1 which satisﬁes f = P∞n=1hf, φnifn = P∞n=1hf, fniφn for all f ∈ H
and a given frame Φ is called a dual frame of Φ. The frame operator of a frame Φ,
denoted by SΦ, is determined by SΦf := P∞n=1hf, φniφn; it is well deﬁned on H and

invertible [12]. The sequence eΦ := (S−1

canonical dual of Φ.

Φ (φn))∞n=1 is a dual frame of Φ [12], called the

In addition to dual frames, we also take into consideration sequences which are not
necessarily frames and still provide series expansions (examples can be found e.g.
in
[16, 20, 21, 25]). Given a frame Φ for H, the sequence F = (fn)∞n=1 with elements from
H is called
- an analysis pseudo-dual (in short, a-pseudo-dual ) of Φ, if f = P∞n=1hf, fniφn for
all f ∈ H.
- a synthesis pseudo-dual (in short, s-pseudo-dual ) of Φ, if f = P∞n=1hf, φnifn for all
f ∈ H.

For more on a-pseudo-duals and s-pseudo-duals, see [20].
Given sequences m, Φ, and Ψ, the operator Mm,Φ,Ψ determined by

Mm,Φ,Ψf =

∞X

n=1

mnhf, ψniφn, f ∈ dom(Mm,Φ,Ψ) ⊆ H

is called a multiplier and m is called the symbol of Mm,Φ,Ψ. The multiplier Mm,Φ,Ψ is
called well-deﬁned on H if its domain is H. When Φ and Ψ are frames (resp. Riesz bases)
for H, Mm,Φ,Ψ is called a frame multiplier, resp. Riesz multiplier. Frame multipliers with
semi-normalized symbols are well-deﬁned on H [2]. When m is the constant sequence
(c, c, c, . . .), the multiplier Mm,Φ,Ψ will be denoted by M(c),Φ,Ψ. For works oriented to
invertibility of multipliers refer to [6, 22, 24, 25].

Notice that the assumptions of all assertions in the next sections lead to well-
deﬁndedness of the multipliers Mm,Φ,Ψ and we will not mention this explicitly in the
statements.

2 Motivation - the case of semi-normalized symbols

and Bessel sequences

Here we review the motivating results which concern multipliers with semi-normalized
symbols and take into consideration only Bessel sequences. The starting point for con-
sidering the topic was a result about invertibility of multipliers for Riesz bases and
representation of the inverse via the canonical duals:
Proposition 2.1 [2] Let Φ and Ψ be Riesz bases for H, and let the symbol m be semi-
normalized. Then Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible and

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m, eΨ, eΦ.

(1)

The above statement has lead to investigation of multipliers for (possibly overcom-
plete) frames aiming representation of the inverse (in case of invertibility) of a similar
type like (1), and has led to the following results:
Theorem 2.2 [6] Let Φ and Ψ be frames for H, and let the symbol m be semi-normalized.
Assume that Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible. Then the following statements hold.
(a1) There exists a unique dual frame Φ† of Φ, so that

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψd,Φ† , ∀ dual frames Ψd of Ψ.

(2)

The frame Φ† equals the sequence ((M−1

m,Φ,Ψ)∗(mnψn))∞n=1.

4

D. T. STOEVA AND P. BALAZS

(b1) There exists a unique dual frame Ψ† of Ψ, so that

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,Φd , ∀ dual frames Φd of Φ.

(3)

The frame Ψ† equals the sequence (M−1

m,Φ,Ψ(mnφn))∞n=1.

(a2) Φ† is the only Bessel sequence in H which satisﬁes (2).
(b2) Ψ† is the only Bessel sequence in H which satisﬁes (3).
(a3) If F = (fn)∞n=1 is a Bessel sequence in H which fulﬁlls

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,F,Φ†,

then F must be a dual frame of Ψ.

(b3) If G = (gn)∞n=1 is a Bessel sequence in H which fulﬁlls

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,G,

then G must be a dual frame of Φ.

Theorem 2.2 naturally leads to the following questions:

[Q1] Are there non-Bessel sequences, which can be used in the role of Φd and
Ψd, or in the role of Φ† and Ψ†?

[Q2] What about cases when m is not necessarily semi-normalized?

Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.2, the uniquely determined dual frame Φ† of Φ

(resp. Ψ† of Ψ) is referred to as the dual frame of Φ (resp. Ψ) induced by Mm,Φ,Ψ.

While the representations of the inverse in (2) and (3) determine an appropriate
analogue of (1) for the general frame case, notice that one may still have precisely the
formula (1) even in the overcomplete case (e.g., for every frame Φ for H, M(1),Φ,Φ is the
frame operator of Φ and so it is invertible and fulﬁlls (1)), but this is certainly not always
the case, see [6, Example 4.2]. The statement below presents some suﬃcient conditions,
in certain cases being also necessary, for validity of (1).

Proposition 2.3 [6] Let the assumptions of Theorem 2.2 hold. Then

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m, eΨ, eΦ ⇐ Ψ is equivalent to mΦ ⇔ Ψ† = eΨ;
M−1
m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m, eΨ, eΦ ⇐ Φ is equivalent to mΨ ⇔ Φ† = eΦ.
M−1

(4)

(5)

For the case m = (c, c, c, . . .), c 6= 0,

(c),Φ,Ψ = M(1/c), eΨ, eΦ ⇔ Ψ is equivalent to Φ ⇔ Ψ† = eΨ
M−1
⇔ Φ† = eΦ.

ON THE DUAL FRAME INDUCED BY AN INVERTIBLE FRAME MULTIPLIER

5

Notice that the equivalence of the frames Ψ and mΦ (resp. Φ and mΨ) already
implies invertibility of Mm,Φ,Ψ, and (1) holds. When Ψ is not equivalent to mΦ and Φ
is not equivalent to mΨ, then Mm,Φ,Ψ can still be invertible (see, e.g., [25, Ex. 4.6.3(ii)],
where neither Ψ is equivalent to mΦ, nor Φ is equivalent to mΨ, but Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible;
furthermore (1) does not hold) and the question is whether in such cases it may happen
at all to have (1):

[Q3] Are the ﬁrst implications in (4), resp. (5), actually equivalences?

As shown in Proposition 2.3, in the case when m is a constant sequence, the answer
of [Q3] is aﬃrmative, so the aim now is to answer the question in the general case of m
not necessarily being a constant sequence.

The paper is devoted to the above and related questions. Answers of [Q1] and [Q2]
In addition, in this

were announced in [26] without proofs; they are presented here.
paper we also present investigation related to the question [Q3].

3 On [Q1]: non-Bessel sequences

In this section we extend Theorem 2.2, taking non-Bessel sequences into consideration,
and answer [Q1], while continuing the numbering from Theorem 2.2.

Theorem 3.1 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2.2 hold and let Φ† and Ψ† be determined
by Theorem 2.2. Then the following statements hold.

(a4) Φ† is the only sequence in H which satisﬁes (2).
(b4) Ψ† is the only sequence in H which satisﬁes (3).
(a5) M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψsd,Φ† , ∀ s-pseudo-duals Ψsd of Ψ.
m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,Φad , ∀ a-pseudo-duals Φad of Φ.

(b5) M−1

(a6) If F = (fn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H such that M1/m,F,Φ† is well-deﬁned and

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,F,Φ†,

then F must be an s-pseudo-dual of Ψ.

(b6) If G = (gn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H such that M1/m,Ψ†,G is well-deﬁned and

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,G,

then G must be an a-pseudo-dual of Φ.

For the proof of the above proposition, we will use the following statements:

Lemma 3.2 Let Φ be a frame for H and let m be such that mn 6= 0 for every n.
Assume that G = (gn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H so that Mm,G,Φd (resp. Mm,Φd,G) is the
null-operator on H for every dual frame Φd of Φ. Then G is the null-sequence.

Proof: Assume that the sequence G is such that Mm,G,Φd is the null operator on H
for every dual frame Φd = (φd

n)∞n=1 of Φ. Let f ∈ H. Then

The dual frames of Φ are characterized as the sequences (eφn + hn −P∞j=1heφn, φjihj)∞n=1

where (hn)∞n=1 runs through the Bessel sequences (see, e.g., [11, Theor. 5.6.5]). Using
this characterization, we get

∞X

n=1

mnhf, eφn + hn −

∞X

j=1

heφn, φjihjign = 0, ∀ Bessel sequence (hn)∞n=1 in H.

Using (6) with eΦ in the role of Φd, it then follows that

that g1 = 0.
In a similar way, taking (hn)∞n=1 = (0, 0, . . . , 0, ei, 0, . . .) with ei being at the i-th

place, i ≥ 2, we get gi = 0, i ≥ 2.
dual frame Φd = (φd
G is the null sequence. ✷

Assuming that G is a sequence such that Mm,Φd,G is the null operator on H for every
n)∞n=1 of Φ, one may proceed with similar techniques to prove that

Proof of Theorem 3.1: Throughout the proof, let M denote the multiplier Mm,Φ,Ψ.
(a4) Assume that F = (fn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H so that M−1 = M1/m,Ψd,F for every
dual frame Ψd of Ψ. By Theorem 2.2 (b1), it follows that M1/m,Ψ†,Φd = M1/m,F,Φd for
every dual frame Ψd of Ψ. Then Lemma 3.2 implies that F = Ψ†.

(b4) can be proved in a similar way as (a4).
(a5) Assume that Ψsd is an s-pseudo-dual of Ψ.

n = f , which implies that

Then for every f ∈ H,

Since Φ† is the sequence ((M−1)∗(mnψn))∞n=1, it now follows that M1/m,Ψsd,Φ† is well
deﬁned and equal to M−1.

(b5) Assume that Φad is an a-pseudo-dual of Φ. Then for every f ∈ H,

P∞n=1hf, φad

M−1f =

Since Ψ† is the sequence (M−1(mnφn))∞n=1, it follows that M1/m,Ψ†,Φad is well deﬁned
and equal to M−1.

(a6) Assume that F = (fn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H such that M1/m,F,Φ† is well-deﬁned

and M−1 = M1/m,F,Φ†. Then for every f ∈ H,

Therefore, F is an s-pseudo-dual of Ψ.

(b6) Assume that G = (gn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H such that M1/m,Ψ†,G is well-deﬁned

and M−1 = M1/m,Ψ†,G. Then for every f ∈ H,

4 On [Q2]: non-semi-normalized symbols

Here we consider multipliers with symbols not necessarily being semi-normalized, as well
as taking into consideration sequences not necessarily being Bessel.

Proposition 4.1 Let Φ and Ψ be frames for H, and let the symbol m be such that
mn 6= 0 for every n and the sequence mΦ be a frame for H. Assume that Mm,Φ,Ψ is
invertible. Then the following statements hold.

(i) There exists a unique sequence Ψ† in H so that

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,Φad , ∀ a-pseudo-duals Φad of Φ,

and it is a dual frame of Ψ. Furthermore, Ψ† = (M−1

m,Φ,Ψ(mnφn))∞n=1.

(ii) If G = (gn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H such that M1/m,Ψ†,G is well-deﬁned and

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,G,

then G must be an a-pseudo-dual of Φ.

(i) Consider Mm,Φ,Ψ = M(1),mΦ,Ψ. Then Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 3.1 can be

Proof:
applied to M(1),mΦ,Ψ, implying that there exists a dual frame Ψ† of Ψ so that

M−1

D. T. STOEVA AND P. BALAZS

(1),mΦ,Ψ(mnφn))∞n=1 = (M−1

furthermore, Ψ† =
and this frame Ψ† is the only sequence in H satisfying (7);
(M−1
m,Φ,Ψ(mnφn))∞n=1. Since the a-pseudo-duals of mΦ are
precisely the sequences (1/m)Φad with Φad being an a-pseudo-dual of Φ, the property
(7) is equivalent to

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,Φad , ∀ a-pseudo-duals Φad of Φ.

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψ†,G, i.e., M−1

(ii) Assume that G = (gn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H such that M1/m,Ψ†,G is well-deﬁned
and M−1
(1),mΦ,Ψ = M(1),Ψ†,(1/m)G. By Theorem 3.1 applied to
M(1),mΦ,Ψ, we can conclude that (1/m)G is an a-pseudo-duals of mΦ, which implies that
G is an a-pseudo-dual of Φ. ✷
Remark: In the above proposition it is assumed that Φ is a frame for H and m is such
that mΦ is also a frame for H. Notice that by [23], both Φ and mΦ being frames may
happen only in cases determined as follows:
• Φ is a Riesz basis for H and m is semi-normalized (in this case mΦ is a Riesz basis
for H);
• Φ is an overcomplete frame for H and m ∈ ℓ∞, or, Φ is an overcomplete frame for
H so that no positive constant a fulﬁlls a < kφnk for all n ∈ N and m /∈ ℓ∞ (in such
cases mΦ can be an overcomplete frame for H).

The above Proposition 4.1 is related to the unique dual frame of Ψ induced by
Mm,Φ,Ψ. With a similar proof, one can show the validity of the following statement
which concerns the unique dual frame of Φ induced by Mm,Φ,Ψ:

Proposition 4.2 Let Φ and Ψ be frames for H, and let the symbol m be such that
mn 6= 0 for every n and the sequence mΨ is a frame for H. Assume that Mm,Φ,Ψ is
invertible. Then the following statements hold.

(i) There exists a unique sequence Φ† in H so that

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,Ψsd,Φ† , ∀ s-pseudo-duals Ψsd of Ψ,

and it is a dual frame of Φ. Furthermore, Φ† = ((M−1)∗(mnψn))∞n=1.

(ii) If F = (fn)∞n=1 is a sequence in H such that M1/m,F,Φ† is well-deﬁned and

then F must be an s-pseudo-dual of Ψ.

M−1

m,Φ,Ψ = M1/m,F,Φ†,

If the symbol is assumed to be bounded, the assumptions that the weighted sequences

is a frame is automatically fulﬁlled, so in summary:

Corollary 4.3 Let Φ and Ψ be frames for H, and let the symbol m be such that mn 6= 0
for every n and m ∈ ℓ∞. Assume that Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible. Then Propositions 4.1 and
4.2 apply.

Proof: Write Mm,Φ,Ψ in the way M(1),mΦ,Ψ. Since mΦ and Ψ are Bessel sequences
and Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible, [22, Prop. 3.1] implies that mΦ is a frame for H and thus,
Proposition 4.1 applies. In a similar way, writing Mm,Φ,Ψ = M(1),Φ,mΨ and using [22,
Prop. 3.1], it follows that mΨ is a frame for H and thus, Proposition 4.2 applies. ✷

For an illustration of Corollary 4.3, consider the following example.

Example 4.4 [25] Consider

Φ = (e1, e1,−e1, e2, e2, −e2, e3, e3, −e3, . . .),

Then Mm,Φ,Ψ = IdH and all the assumptions of Corollary 4.3 are satisﬁed.

To illustrate that Proposition 4.1 covers a larger class of multipliers then Corollary

Then Mm,Φ,Ψ = IdH and all the assumptions of Proposition 4.1 are satisﬁed. Since
m /∈ ℓ∞ and mΨ is not a frame, Corollary 4.3 and Proposition 4.2 do not apply.

5 On [Q3]: Inversion using the canonical duals

Here we show that in general the answer of [Q3] is negative, providing an example:

Example 5.1 Consider the sequences

Φ = (e1, e1,−e1, e2, e2,−e2, e3, e3,−e3, . . .),

However, Ψ is not equivalent to mΦ and Φ is not equivalent to mΨ.

Furthermore, Mm,Φ,Ψ can not be written as M(1),(cnφn)∞

n=1 for any (cn)∞n=1
and (dn)∞n=1 with (cnφn)∞n=1 being equivalent to (dnψn)∞n=1. Assume the opposite, i.e.,
that Mm,Φ,Ψ can be written as described. Then all cn and dn would be non-zero, because
cndn = mn 6= 0 for all n. Denote k := d1
and let V : H → H denote the bounded
bijective operator mapping every cnφn to the corresponding dnψn. Then c1V (e1) =
V (c1e1) = d1e1 and −c3V (e1) = V (−c3e1) = d3e1, implying that d3 = −kc3. Then
0 < m1 = c1d1 = k |c1|2 and 0 < m3 = c3d3 = −k |c3|2 leading to a contradiction.

The above example actually shows that even the weaker question

As shown in Proposition 2.3, for the class of frame multipliers with constant symbols,
the answer of [Q3] is aﬃrmative. In the following we determine a larger class of multi-
pliers, where the answer of [Q3] is still aﬃrmative. When a frame Φ is multiplied with a

weight m, and the result mΦ is a frame, i.e. a weighted frame [3], the conjugate recipro-
is precisely
cal weighted canonical dual frame
the canonical dual of mΦ, then the answer of [Q3] is aﬃrmative and this in particular
extends the formula (1) for Riesz multipliers to a certain class of frame multipliers:
Proposition 5.2 Let a frame Φ for H and a sequence m with mn 6= 0 for all n be such
that mΦ is a frame for H with the property gmΦ = 1
meΦ. Then for any frame Ψ for H:

is always a dual frame of mΦ. If

m eΦ

Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible and (1) holds ⇔ Ψ is equivalent to mΦ

⇔ Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible and Ψ† = eΨ.

Proof: By [6, Theor. 4.6], which concerns frame multipliers with constant symbols, we
have that
Ψ is equivalent to mΦ ⇔ M(1),mΦ,Ψ is invertible and M−1
⇔ M(1),mΦ,Ψ is invertible and (M−1

1,mΦ,Ψ = M(1), eΨ,gmΦ
(1),mΦ,Ψ(mnφn))∞n=1 = eΨ.
meΦ, it follows that M(1), eΨ,gmΦ is actually the multiplier
Using the assumption gmΦ = 1
M1/m, eΨ, eΦ and this completes the proof of the ﬁrst equivalence. For the second equiva-
lence, use Proposition 4.1(i). ✷

In a similar way as in Proposition 5.2, one can show validity of the following state-

ment:
Proposition 5.3 Let a frame Ψ for H and a sequence m with mn 6= 0 for all n be such
m eΨ. Then for any frame Φ for H:
that mΨ is a frame for H with the property gmΨ = 1

Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible and (1) holds ⇔ Φ is equivalent to mΨ

⇔ Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible and Φ† = eΦ.

Finally we can state a result for symbols with constant amplitude but varying phase:
Corollary 5.4 Let Φ and Ψ be frames for H and let m be such that |mn| = c 6= 0 for
every n. Then

Mm,Φ,Ψ is invertible and (1) holds ⇔ Ψ is equivalent to mΦ
⇔ Φ is equivalent to mΨ.

Proof: Clearly, mΦ and mΨ are frames for H. Furthermore, SmΦ = c2SΦ, implying
that

meΦ. In a similar way, it follows that gmΨ = 1

Φ (φn) =

Therefore, gmΦ = 1

5.2 and 5.3 complete the proof. ✷

As a simple example illustrating Corollary 5.4,

the frames Φ =
(e1, e1, e2, e2, e3, e3, . . .) and Ψ = (e1,−e1, e2,−e2, e3,−e3, . . .), and the sequence m =
(1,−1, 1,−1, 1,−1, . . .), for which one has Ψ = mΦ and Φ = mΨ.
