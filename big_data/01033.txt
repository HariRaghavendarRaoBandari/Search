USING STEINBERG ALGEBRAS TO STUDY DECOMPOSABILITY OF

LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS

LISA ORLOFF CLARK, DOLORES MART´IN BARQUERO, C ´ANDIDO MART´IN GONZ ´ALEZ,

AND MERCEDES SILES MOLINA

Abstract. Given an arbitrary graph E we investigate the relationship between E and the
groupoid GE. We show that there is a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of pairs
(H, S), where H is a hereditary and saturated set of vertices and S is a set of breaking
vertices associated to H, onto the lattice of open invariant subsets of G(0)
E . We use this
lattice isomorphism to characterize the decomposability of the Leavitt path algebra LK(E),
where K is a ﬁeld. First we ﬁnd a graph condition to characterise when an open invariant
subset of G(0)
E is closed. Then we give both a graph condition and a groupoid condition each
of which is equivalent to LK(E) being decomposable in the sense that it can be written as a
direct sum of two nonzero ideals.

1. Introduction

Leavitt path algebras were introduced in [2] and [3] as a generalization of Leavitt algebras
([13]). They are the algebraic counterpart of operator algebras associated to directed graphs
([15]). They have attracted the attention of both, ring theorists and operator algebraists and
the techniques that emerged to study these algebras have typically been algebraic, analytic,
or a mix of both. In this paper our techniques are more topological in nature.

In [7], the authors show that each Leavitt path algebra LK(E) is isomorphic to a Steinberg
algebra deﬁned as follows: ﬁrst, one constructs a topological groupoid GE from the directed
graph E. Next, the Steinberg algebra associated to E is the convolution algebra of locally
constant, compactly supported functions from GE into the ﬁeld K.

In this paper, we use the Steinberg algebra model of a Leavitt path algebra to determine
its algebraic decomposability. An algebra A is called decomposable if it can be written as the
direct sum of two nonzero ideals. For Leavitt path algebras it turns out that decomposability
is equivalent to graded decomposability (see Lemma 5.1).

In our main theorem we show that the decomposability of LK(E) is equivalent to the
topological decomposability of GE. Moreover, we show that LK(E) is decomposable if and

only if there exists a nonempty, proper, hereditary and saturated subset H of E0 such that
two additional graph conditions are satisﬁed:

(a) Every inﬁnite path whose vertices are outside of H eventually does not connect to H.
(b) Every inﬁnite emitter having an inﬁnite number of edges connecting to H must be

either in H or a breaking vertex for H.

(See the conditions in Theorem 5.2 (iii).)

Before proving our main result (Theorem 5.2), we show how some graph properties and
groupoid properties are connected. Consider the lattice TE of pairs (H, S) where H is a
hereditary saturated subset of vertices and S is a set of breaking vertices of H. We are
interested in TE because this lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of graded ideals of the Leavitt
path algebra ([1, Theorem 2.5.6]).

We establish a lattice isomorphism from TE onto the lattice OE of open invariant subsets
of G(0)
E (see Theorem 3.3). This result generalises [5, Lemma 6.4] to graphs that are not
necessarily row-ﬁnite. We remark that for row-ﬁnite graphs without sinks, Lemma 6.4 in
[5] says that there is an isomorphism from the lattice of hereditary and saturated subsets of
vertices onto OE, which is not surprising. However when inﬁnite emitters are present the
appropriate lattice to be considered is TE, which involves not only hereditary and saturated
sets but also to breaking vertices, while the lattice OE remains the same.

We ﬁnd our lattice isomorphism from TE to OE very useful: The lattice structure of TE
is complicated. In particular, the explicit formula for the ∨ relation is notoriously diﬃcult
to deﬁne. However, the lattice structure of OE is the standard one (⊆, ∪, ∩). Moreover, we
prove that there is also a lattice isomorphism between OE and that of the graded ideals of
the Steinberg algebra AK(GE) (see Corollary 3.9).

The last ingredients we need to prove Theorem 5.2 are necessary and suﬃcient conditions
on a pair (H, S) to ensure the corresponding element UH,S ∈ OE is closed, which we give in
Proposition 4.1. In fact, the set S of breaking vertices is completely determined as it must
be the set of all breaking vertices for the hereditary and saturated set H.

Leavitt path algebra decomposability is also studied in [4]. In the ﬁnal section we compare
our results to those in [4]. We expected our decomposibility conditions to be equivalent to
the characterisation given in [4, Theorem 4.2]. However, we ﬁnd that [4, Theorem 4.2] is
incorrect; see Example (6.1) for a counterexample. In Theorem 6.5 we provide a modiﬁed
formulation which also appears in [4, Proposition 4.5] and [4, Proposition 4.6]. We then show
the equivalence between the graph conditions in our Theorem 5.2 and the graph condition in
Theorem 6.5.

2. Preliminaries

Directed Graphs. A directed graph is a 4-tuple E = (E0, E1, rE, sE) consisting of two
disjoint sets E0, E1 and two maps rE, sE : E1 → E0. The elements of E0 are the vertices
and the elements of E1 are the edges of E. Further, for e ∈ E1, rE(e) and sE(e) are called
the range and the source of e, respectively. If there is no confusion with respect to the graph
we are considering, we simply write r(e) and s(e).

A vertex which emits no edges is called a sink. A vertex v is called an inﬁnite emitter if
s−1(v) is an inﬁnite set, and a regular vertex if it is neither a sink nor an inﬁnite emitter. The

USING STEINBERG ALGEBRAS TO STUDY DECOMPOSABILITY OF LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS 3

set of inﬁnite emitters will be denoted by Inf(E) while Reg(E) will denote the set of regular
vertices.

In order to deﬁne the Leavitt path algebra, we need to introduce the extended graph of
i | ei ∈ E1} and the

E. This is the graph bE = (E0, E1 ∪ (E1)∗, r bE, s bE), where (E1)∗ = {e∗

functions r bE and s bE are deﬁned as
= r, s bE |E1

i ) = s(ei), and s bE(e∗

= s, r bE(e∗

r bE |E1

i ) = r(ei).

The elements of E1 will be called real edges, while for e ∈ E1 we will call e∗ a ghost edge.

A nontrivial path µ in a graph E is a ﬁnite sequence of edges µ = µ1 . . . µn such that
r(µi) = s(µi+1) for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.1 In this case, s(µ) := s(µ1) and r(µ) := r(µn) are the
source and range of µ, respectively, and n is the length of µ. We also say that µ is a path from
s(µ1) to r(µn) and denote by µ0 the set of its vertices, i.e., µ0 := {s(µ1), r(µ1), . . . , r(µn)}.
By convention r(µ0) := s(µ).

We view the elements of E0 as paths of length 0. The set of all (ﬁnite) paths of a graph E is
denoted by Path(E). In this paper we will also consider inﬁnite paths, i.e., inﬁnite sequences
x = x1x2 . . . , where xi ∈ E1 and r(xi) = s(xi+1) for every i ∈ N. We denote the set of all
inﬁnite paths by E∞. We also deﬁne s(x) := s(x1).

For vertices u, v we say u ≥ v whenever there is a path µ such that s(µ) = u and r(µ) = v,
A subset H of E0 is called hereditary if v ≥ w and v ∈ H imply w ∈ H. A hereditary set is
saturated if every regular vertex which feeds into H and only into H is again in H, that is,
if s−1(v) 6= ∅ is ﬁnite and r(s−1(v)) ⊆ H imply v ∈ H.

Let E be a graph. For every non empty hereditary subset H of E0, deﬁne

FE(H) = {α ∈ Path(E) | αi ∈ E1, s(α1) ∈ E0 \ H, r(αi) ∈ E0 \ H for i < |α|, r(α|α|) ∈ H}.

Leavitt path algebras. Given a (directed) graph E and a ﬁeld K, the path K-algebra of
E, denoted by KE, is deﬁned as the free associative K-algebra generated by the set of paths
of E with relations:

(V) vw = δv,wv for all v, w ∈ E0.
(E1) s(e)e = er(e) = e for all e ∈ E1.

The Leavitt path algebra of E with coeﬃcients in K, denoted LK(E), is the quotient of the

(CK1) e∗e′ = δe,e′r(e) for all e, e′ ∈ E1.

path algebra KbE by the ideal of KbE generated by the relations:
(CK2) v =P{e∈E1|s(e)=v} ee∗
Observe that in KbE the relations (V) and (E1) remain valid and that the following is also

(E2) r(e)e∗ = e∗s(e) = e∗ for all e ∈ E1.

for every v ∈ Reg(E).

satisﬁed:

One can show

LK(E) = span{αβ∗ | α, β ∈ Path(E)}

1We warn the reader that this convention has not been universally adopted and some of our references use

the path convention of [15], where s(µi) = r(µi+1).

and that LK(E) is a Z-graded K-algebra.
component LK(E)n is spanned by the set

In particular, for each n ∈ Z, the degree n

{αβ∗ | α, β ∈ Path(E) and length(α) − length(β) = n}.

Our notation for elements of LK(E) is standard. However, in this paper, we often consider
elements of the set Path(E).
In particular, we will not assume any of the structure that
comes with elements of the quotient LK(E). We hope this will not be too confusing and we
try to make clear when we are working in LK(E).

Groupoids and Steinberg algebras. A groupoid G is a generalisation of a group in which
the ‘binary operation’ is only partially deﬁned. For a precise deﬁnition see [16]. The unit
space of G is denoted G(0) and is deﬁned such that

G(0) := {γγ−1 | γ ∈ G} = {γ−1γ | γ ∈ G}.

Groupoid source and range maps r, s : G → G(0) are deﬁned such that

s(γ) = γ−1γ

and

r(γ) = γγ−1.

Although the notation and terminology of r and s have both a graphical and a groupoid
interpretation, it will be clear from context which one we mean.

Steinberg algebras, introduced in [17], are algebras associated to ‘ample’ groupoids and are
deﬁned as follows. First, a topological groupoid is a groupoid equipped with a topology such
that composition and inversion are continuous. Next, we say an open subset B of a groupoid
G is an open bisection if r and s restricted to B are homeomorphisms onto an open subset
of G(0). Finally, we say a topological groupoid G is ample if there is a basis for its topology
consisting of compact open bisections.

Given an ample groupoid G and a ﬁeld K, the Steinberg algebra associated to G is

AK(G) := span{1B | B is a compact open bisection}

where 1B : G → K is the characteristic function of B. Addition and scalar multiplication in
AK(G) are deﬁned pointwise. Multiplication is given by the convolution

f ∗ g(γ) = Xαβ=γ

f (α)g(β).

For compact open bisections B and D the convolution gives 1B1D = 1BD. In this paper we

will omit the ∗ symbol for the convolution.

In the remainder of this section, we recall how the Leavitt path algebra is isomorphic to a
Steinberg algebra. The following construction of a groupoid GE from an arbitrary graph E
can be found in [14] and is a generalisation of the construction found in [12] in that it allows
graphs with inﬁnite emitters and/or sinks. Note that [14] considers only countable graphs.
Therefore we follow the construction of [6, Example 2.1] which does not require countability.
Deﬁne

X := E∞ ∪ {µ ∈ Path(E) | rE(µ) is a sink} ∪ {µ ∈ Path(E) | rE(µ) ∈ Inf(E)} and
GE := {(αx, |α| − |β|, βx) | α, β ∈ Path(E), x ∈ X, rE(α) = rE(β) = sE(x)}.

USING STEINBERG ALGEBRAS TO STUDY DECOMPOSABILITY OF LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS 5

A pair of elements in GE is composable if and only if they are of the form ((x, k, y), (y, l, z))
and then the composition and inverse maps are deﬁned such that

(x, k, y)(y, l, z) := (x, k + l, z)

and

(x, k, y)−1 := (y, −k, x).

Thus

G(0)

E = {(x, 0, x) | x ∈ X} which we identify with X.

Remark 2.1. For any v ∈ E0 there exists yv ∈ G(0)
E such that s(yv) = v. Indeed, if v is an
inﬁnite emitter or a sink, then yv = v. Otherwise v ∈ Reg(E0). Fix e1 ∈ s−1(v). If r(e1) is
an inﬁnite emitter or a sink, then we may choose yv = e1. If it is not, then r(e1) ∈ Reg(E0)
and we repeat the same process in order to set yv = e1e2 . . . as claimed.

Next we show how GE can be viewed as an ample groupoid. For µ ∈ Path(E) deﬁne

and for µ ∈ Path(E) and a ﬁnite F ⊆ s−1(r(µ)), deﬁne

Z(µ) := {µx | x ∈ X, r(µ) = s(x)} ⊆ X

Z(µ \ F ) := Z(µ) ∩(cid:16)G(0)

E \ [α∈F

Z(µα)(cid:17).

Then the sets of the form Z(µ\F ) are a basis of compact open sets for a Hausdorﬀ topology

on X = G(0)

E by [18, Theorem 2.1].

We point out that the topological structure around inﬁnite emitters can be surprising. For
example, assume that v is an inﬁnite emitter and that {en} ⊆ s−1(v) is an inﬁnite set. Then
enyr(en) → v.

Now for each µ, ν ∈ Path(E) with r(µ) = r(ν), and ﬁnite F ⊆ Path(E) such that r(µ) =

s(α) for all α ∈ F , deﬁne

Z(µ, ν) := {(µx, |µ| − |ν|, νx) | x ∈ X, r(µ) = s(x)},

and then

Z((µ, ν) \ F ) := Z(µ, ν) ∩(cid:16)G(0)

E \ [α∈F

Z(µα, να)(cid:17).

Now the collection Z((µ, ν) \ F ) forms a basis of compact open bisections that generate a
topology such that GE is a Hausdorﬀ ample groupoid.

Finally, putting everything together we have a graded isomorphism

3. Lattices

In this paper, one thing we focus on is the topological structure of invariant subsets of G(0)
E .
We say that U ⊆ G(0)
E is invariant if x ∈ U and (x, k, y) ∈ GE then y ∈ U. Equivalently, U is
invariant if y ∈ U and (x, k, y) ∈ GE then x ∈ U. Note that if U is invariant then GE \ U is
also invariant. Let OE denote the set of open invariant subsets of G(0)
E . Then OE is a lattice
with the standard structure given by (⊆, ∪, ∩).

Remark 3.1. Fix an invariant U ⊆ G(0)
to y (i.e. x and y are eventually the same). Then x ∈ U if and only if y ∈ U.

E . Let x and y be in G(0)

E such that x is shift equivalent

In this section we show that there is a lattice isomorphism from the graph lattice TE
(deﬁned below) onto the lattice OE. Following [1, Deﬁnitions 2.4.3], let H be a hereditary
subset of E0, and let v ∈ E0. We say that v is a breaking vertex of H if v belongs to the set

BH := {v ∈ E0 \ H | v ∈ Inf(E) and 0 < |s−1(v) ∩ r−1(E0 \ H)| < ∞}.

In words, BH consists of those vertices which are inﬁnite emitters, which do not belong to
H, and for which the ranges of the edges they emit are all, except for a ﬁnite (but nonzero)
number, inside H. We set

TE := {(H, S) | H is satuarated and hereditary and S ⊆ BH}.

These pairs were also considered in a C ∗-context, for example in [9, 8]. We deﬁne the following
relation on TE:

(H1, S1) ≤ (H2, S2) if and only if H1 ⊆ H2 and S1 ⊆ S2 ∪ H2.

Then TE has a lattice structure with explicit formulas for ∨ and ∧ given in [4, Remark 3.4]
(see also [1, Proposition 2.5.4]). Note that every graded ideal in a Leavitt path algebra is
generated by a pair (H, S) as deﬁned in [1, Deﬁnition 2.5.3] (see Corollary 3.9).

Deﬁnitions 3.2. Let (H, S) ∈ TE. Then deﬁne

(2)

(3)

(4)

UH := {x ∈ G(0)
US := {α ∈ Path(E) | r(α) ∈ S} and

E | r(xn) ∈ H for some n},

UH,S := UH ⊔ US.

On the other hand, given U ∈ OE, deﬁne

(5)

(6)

HU := {v ∈ E0 | Z(v) ⊆ U} and
SU := {r(α) | α ∈ U ∩ Path(E), r(α) is an inﬁnite emitter and r(α) 6∈ HU } ⊆ U.

Theorem 3.3. Suppose E is an arbitrary graph. Then the map φ : TE → OE given by:

is a lattice isomorphism whose inverse is the map ρ : OE → TE given by

φ((H, S)) = UH,S,

We will give the proof in a series of lemmas.

Lemma 3.4. Fix (H, S) ∈ TE, then UH,S ∈ OE.

ρ(U) = (HU , SU ).

USING STEINBERG ALGEBRAS TO STUDY DECOMPOSABILITY OF LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS 7

Proof. First we prove that UH,S is open. Fix x ∈ UH,S. If x ∈ UH then there exists an n such
that r(xn) ∈ H. Thus,

because H is hereditary. Now in the case where x ∈ US, deﬁne

F := {e ∈ E1 | s(e) = r(x) and r(e) /∈ H}

x ∈ Z(x1 · · · xn) ⊆ UH

which is ﬁnite by the deﬁnition of S. Then x ∈ Z(x \ F ) ⊆ UH,S.

Next we show that UH,S is invariant. Consider (αx, k, βx) ∈ GE such that βx ∈ UH,S. If
βx ∈ UH then since H is hereditary, there exists some n ∈ N ∪ {0} such that r(xn) ∈ H. This
implies that αx ∈ UH.

On the other hand, if βx ∈ US, then r(βx) is an inﬁnite emitter and equals r(αx) so
(cid:3)

αx ∈ US.

Lemma 3.5. Fix U ∈ OE, then (HU , SU ) ∈ TE.

Proof. First we show that HU is hereditary. Fix e ∈ E1 such that s(e) ∈ HU . To see that
r(e) ∈ HU it suﬃces to prove Z(r(e)) ⊆ U. So ﬁx x ∈ Z(r(e)). Then x ∈ U because U is
invariant.

Next we show HU is saturated. Fix a regular vertex v such that r(s−1(v)) ⊆ HU . We must
show v ∈ HU , that is, Z(v) ⊆ U. In order to do this ﬁx x ∈ Z(v). We may write x = ey for
some e ∈ s−1(v). Thus, r(e) ∈ HU . Thus Z(r(e)) ⊆ U. But now we have y ∈ Z(r(e)) ⊆ U.
Therefore x ∈ U again by invariance of U.

Finally we show SU ⊆ BHU . Fix v ∈ SU . Note that U invariant implies v ∈ U. Since U is

open, there exists a ﬁnite F ⊆ Path(E) such that Z(v \ F ) ⊆ U. Deﬁne now

We claim that

F1 := {α1 | α = α1 · · · αn ∈ F }.

r(s−1(v)) ∩ (E0 \ HU ) ⊆ r(F1).

To prove the claim, ﬁx a w ∈ r(s−1(v)) ∩ (E0 \ HU ). Then there is some e ∈ E1 such that
s(e) = v and r(e) = w 6∈ HU . We know that Z(e) ⊆ Z(v) but since w /∈ HU then Z(w) * U
and by invariance Z(e) * U either. Because Z(v \ F ) ⊆ U, we must have

Z(e) ∩ ([α∈F

Z(α)) 6= ∅.

Consequently there is some α ∈ F such that Z(e) ∩ Z(α) 6= ∅ and in fact we must have
α1 = e and hence w ∈ r(F1), proving the claim. Since F is ﬁnite, we have the ﬁniteness
of r(s−1(v)) ∩ (E0 \ HU ). This, together with the fact that v is an inﬁnite emitter implies
v ∈ BHU .
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.6. We have φ ◦ ρ = 1OE .

Proof. Fix U ∈ OE. Then

φ(ρ(U)) = φ((HU , SU )) = UHU ,SU .

We show that UHU ,SU = U. Starting with the left hand side, ﬁx x ∈ UHU ,SU .

Case 1. Suppose x ∈ UHU . Then, there exists n ∈ N such that r(xn) ∈ HU . Thus

Z(r(xn)) ⊆ U and hence x ∈ U by Remark 3.1.

Case 2. Suppose x ∈ USU . Then r(x) ∈ SU ⊆ U. Consequently, x ∈ U by Remark 3.1.

8

L.O. CLARK, D. MART´IN, C. MART´IN, AND M. SILES

We have proved UHU ,SU ⊆ U. For the reverse inclusion, ﬁx x ∈ U. We consider the three

possibilities for x.

Case 1. Assume x ∈ Path(E) and r(x) is a sink. By Remark 3.1 we have that r(x) ∈ U.

Now

and this implies r(x) ∈ HU giving x ∈ UHU .

Case 2. Suppose x ∈ E∞. Since U is open, there exists n ∈ N such that

{r(x)} = Z(r(x)) ⊆ U

Z(x1 . . . xn) ⊆ U.

Since each element in Z(r(xn)) is shift equivalent to an element in Z(x1 . . . xn) we get
Z(r(xn)) ⊆ U by Remark 3.1. This means r(xn) ∈ HU . Then x ∈ UHU by Deﬁnition
3.2 (2).

Case 3. Finally, assume x ∈ Path(E) and r(x) is an inﬁnite emitter. If r(x) ∈ HU then
x ∈ UHU by Deﬁnition 3.2 (2). Otherwise, suppose r(x) /∈ HU . Then r(x) ∈ SU by Deﬁnition
3.2 (6). Now x ∈ USU by Deﬁnition 3.2 (3).

In all three cases, x ∈ UHU ,SU and we are done.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.7. We have ρ ◦ φ = 1TE .

Proof. Fix (H, S) ∈ TE. Then

ρ(φ((H, S))) = ρ(UH,S) = (HV , SV ),

where V := UH,S.

We show that H = HV and S = SV . Fix v ∈ H. To see that v ∈ HV it suﬃces to show
Z(v) ⊆ V by Deﬁnition 3.2 (5). Fix x ∈ Z(v). Then s(x) = v ∈ H so x ∈ UH by Deﬁnition
3.2 (2). Thus x ∈ V .

Next, ﬁx w ∈ HV . By Deﬁnition 3.2 (5) we have Z(w) ⊆ V . By way of contradiction,
assume w /∈ H. We will show that there exists an inﬁnite path x such that s(x) = w and
r(xn) /∈ H for every n ∈ N. Notice that w is not a sink. For otherwise, w ∈ Z(w) ⊆ V
but w /∈ US so w ∈ UH ; but then w ∈ H, a contradiction. We next claim that there exists
e1 ∈ E1 such that s(e1) = w and r(e1) /∈ H. To prove the claim we will consider the two
possible cases for w. First, if w ∈ Reg(E) the existence of e1 comes from H being saturated
and w /∈ H. Second, suppose w ∈ Inf(E). Then w ∈ V . Since w /∈ UH we must have w ∈ US
and therefore w ∈ S. Now the existence of e1 comes from the deﬁnition of BH. Continuing
in this way by replacing w with r(e1) and noting that Z(r(e1)) ⊆ V by Remark 3.1, we get
an inﬁnite path x = e1e2 . . . such that r(en) /∈ H for all n ∈ N.

Combining Z(w) ⊆ V and x ∈ E∞ ∩ Z(w) gives x ∈ UH , contradicting the deﬁnition of

UH . Therefore w ∈ H and we have proved H = HV .

To see that S = SV notice

S = {r(α) | α ∈ US}.

Taking into account H = HV we have

SV := {r(α) | α ∈ V ∩ Path(E), r(α) ∈ Inf(E) \ H} = S.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.8. The maps φ and ρ are both order preserving.

USING STEINBERG ALGEBRAS TO STUDY DECOMPOSABILITY OF LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS 9

Proof. Consider (H1, S1), (H2, S2) ∈ TE such that (H1, S1) ≤ (H2, S2). Notice that by Deﬁ-
nition 3.2(2) we obtain UH1 ⊆ UH2. S imilarly, by Deﬁnition 3.2(3) we get US1 ⊆ US2 ∪ UH2
and that φ is order preserving.

To see that ρ is order preserving, assume U, V ∈ OE such that U ⊆ V . That HU ⊆ HV
follows immediately from Deﬁnition 3.2(5). Now we show SU ⊆ SV ∪ HV . Take r(α) ∈ SU .
If r(α) ∈ HV we are done. Otherwise r(α) ∈ SV because α ∈ U ⊆ V .
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 3.3. The result follows from the lemmas above and [11, Theorem 8.2] which
says that an order preserving bijection between lattices that has an order preserving inverse
is a lattice isomorphism.
(cid:3)

Next, we present a corollary connecting our map φ to the lattice structure of graded ideals
for any algebra A, denote by Lgr(A) the lattice of

in the algebras. First some notation:
graded ideals of A.

For any open invariant U ∈ G(0)

E we deﬁne the map I from OE to the lattice of ideals of

AK(GE)) such that

I(U) := {f ∈ AK(GE) | s(suppf ) ⊆ U}

= span{1B | B is a compact open bissection such that s(B) ⊆ U}.

Note that I(U) is an ideal of the Steinberg algebra AK(GE) by [5, Lemma 3.2]. In Corol-
lary 3.9 we show that I is a lattice isomorphism onto the graded ideals of AK(GE).

Finally, in the Leavitt path algebra, for v ∈ BH, deﬁne

vH := v −

Xe∈s−1(v)∩r−1(E0\H)

ee∗,

and, for any subset S ⊆ BH, deﬁne SH = {vH | v ∈ S}. For any subset X in an algebra, we
denote by Ideal(X) the ideal generated by X.

Then the diagram is commutative and all the maps are lattice isomorphisms.

Proof. Since φ, ϕ′ and π are lattice isomorphisms it suﬃces to show that

for all (H, S) ∈ TE.

First we show (π ◦ ϕ′)((H, S)) ⊆ (I ◦ φ)((H, S)). Fix an element v ∈ H. Then we have

as supp(1Z(w\Fw)) ⊆ UH,S. Thus (π ◦ ϕ′)((H, S)) ⊆ (I ◦ φ)((H, S)) as every generator of

1C = 1Z(α)) = 1Z(α,r(α))Z(r(α)) = 1Z(α,r(α))1Z(r(α))

1C ∈ (π ◦ ϕ′)((H, S))

because 1Z(r(α)) ∈ (π ◦ ϕ′)((H, S)).

Next, ﬁx C ∈ {Z(α \ Fr(α))}r(α)∈AS . So there exists α such that r(α) ∈ S and

C = Z(α \ Fr(α) = Z(α, r(α))Z(r(α) \ Fr(α)).

Since

we have

1Z(r(α)\Fr(α)) ∈ (π ◦ ϕ′)((H, S))

1C = 1Z(α,r(α))Z(r(α)\Fr(α)) = 1Z(α,r(α))1(Z(r(α)\Fr(α)) ∈ (π ◦ ϕ′)((H, S)).

Thus f ∈ (π ◦ ϕ′)((H, S)) as claimed. Now

4. Clopen invariant sets

In this section we give necessary and suﬃcient conditions on a pair (H, S) ∈ TE to ensure
that UH,S is a clopen invariant set. Since UH,S is always an open invariant set (Lemma 3.4),
we characterize when it is also closed.

Let E be an arbitrary graph. For any subset X ⊆ E0 and any vertex v, we denote by

Path(v, X) the set of all ﬁnite paths α such that s(α) = v and r(α) ∈ X.

Proposition 4.1. Let (H, S) ∈ TE and let UH,S be as given in Deﬁnition 3.2(4). Then, UH,S
is closed if and only if the following two conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) If x ∈ E∞ is such that x0 ⊆ E0 \ H, then there exists N ∈ N such that

Path(r(xN ), H) = ∅.

(ii) If v ∈ E0 is such that |{e ∈ E1 | s(e) = v and Path(r(e), H) 6= ∅}| = ∞, then v ∈ H ∪S.

Proof. Suppose that UH,S is closed. To see that condition (i) holds, ﬁx x ∈ E∞ such that
x0 ⊆ E0 \ H. By way of contradiction, suppose for each n ∈ N we have Path(r(xn), H) 6= ∅.
Choose (α)n ∈ Path(r(xn), H) and consider the sequence:

where yr((α)n) is as in Remark 2.1. Notice that this sequence converges to x /∈ UH,S, which is
a contradiction because UH,S is closed. Thus, condition (i) holds.

(cid:0)(cid:0)x1 . . . xn(α)nyr((α)n)(cid:1)n(cid:1) ⊆ UH ,

To see that condition (ii) holds, ﬁx v ∈ E0 such that

|{e ∈ E1 | s(e) = v and Path(r(e), H) 6= ∅}| = ∞.

For each n ∈ N, choose en ∈ E1 such that s(en) = v, Path(r(en), H) 6= ∅ and en 6= em for
m 6= n. Also choose (α)n ∈ Path(r(en), H). Now the sequence (en(α)nyr((α)n)) ⊆ UH , where
yr((α)n) is as in Remark 2.1. Then (en(α)nyr((α)n)) → v; since UH,S is closed, we have v ∈ UH,S.
Therefore v ∈ H ∪ S.

Conversely, assume that conditions (i) and (ii) are satisﬁed. Fix a sequence ((x)n) ⊆ UH,S

such that (x)n → z. We consider the possible cases for z.

Case 1. Suppose z ∈ F(E) and r(z) is a sink. Then {z} = Z(z) is an open set and hence

(x)n = z eventually. Thus z ∈ UH,S.

Case 2. Suppose z ∈ E∞.

If r(zm) ∈ H for some m ∈ N, then z ∈ UH by Deﬁ-
nition 3.2(2). Otherwise, suppose z0 ⊆ E0 \ H. By condition (i) there exists N ∈ N
such that Path(r(zN ), H) = ∅. Notice that z is in the open set Z(z1 . . . zN ), so we have
(x)n ∈ Z(z1 . . . zN ) eventually. However Z(z1 . . . zN ) ∩ UH = ∅, thus (x)n ∈ US eventually.
This is a contradiction because (x)n ∈ S implies Path(r((x)n), H) 6= ∅.

Case 3. Suppose z ∈ F(E) and r(z) ∈ Inf(E).

If r(z) ∈ H then z ∈ UH and we are
done. Similarly, if (x)n = z eventually, then z ∈ UH,S. So, assume r(z) /∈ H and (x)n 6= z
eventually. Deﬁne

F := {e ∈ E1 | s(e) = r(z) and Path(r(e), H) 6= ∅}.

12

L.O. CLARK, D. MART´IN, C. MART´IN, AND M. SILES

We claim that |F | = ∞. To prove the claim, by way of contradiction suppose |F | < ∞. Then
Z(z \ F ) is an open set containing z and hence (x)n ∈ Z(z \ F ) eventually. Note that for
every path µ ∈ Z(z \ F ) with µ 6= z we have Path(r(µ), H) = ∅. Thus Z(z \ F ) ∩ UH = ∅,
which implies (x)n ∈ US eventually. But then Path(r((x)n), H) 6= ∅, which is a contradiction.
Therefore |F | = ∞. Now condition (ii) implies that r(z) ∈ H ∪ S and hence z ∈ UH,S as
needed.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.2. Note that for any (H, S) ∈ TE we must have BH ⊆ UH,S, where (·) denotes
the topological closure. Indeed, ﬁx v ∈ BH. We show that any basic neighbourhood of v
has nonempty intersection with UH,S. Since v ∈ Inf(E) it belongs to G(0)
E . Consider any
basic neighbourhood Z of v. Then v ∈ G(0)
E implies that Z is of the form Z(v \ F ). Since
v ∈ BH, there exists an edge e such that s(e) = v and r(e) ∈ H. Extending e to an element
eyr(e) ∈ G(0)
E we can ensure that eyr(e) ∈ Z ∩ UH,S. Thus, Z ∩ UH,S 6= ∅ and hence v ∈ UH,S.
In particular if UH,S is closed, then BH ⊆ UH,S and so BH = S.

Notice that condition (ii) of Proposition 4.1 implies that S must coincide with BH. Thus,
if UH,S is closed, then S = BH, which is consistent. The reverse implication is not true as the
ﬁrst example that follows will show.

Next, we give some examples to illustrate conditions (i) and (ii) in Proposition 4.1.

Examples 4.3. Consider the graph that follows.

Then UH,∅ is not closed because the sequence (f1, e1f2, e1e2f3, . . . ) is contained in UH,∅ but
it converges to e1e2e3 . . . which is not in UH,∅. On the other hand, condition (i) fails for the
inﬁnite path e1e2e3 . . . .

Now, consider the following graph.

e

•u

f

•v

Note that, in this case, for H = {v} the open set UH,∅ contains the sequence (enf ) that
converges to ee . . . /∈ UH,∅. So again, UH,∅ is not closed. Here, condition (i) fails for the
inﬁnite path eee . . . .

Finally, for the graph

again we have that the open set UH,∅ is not closed, where H = {v}, because the sequence
(fn) converges to u, which is not an element of UH,∅. This time, condition (ii) fails for the
vertex u.

5. Decomposability

Let K be a ﬁeld and E an arbitrary graph. We say that the Leavitt path algebra LK(E) is
decomposable if there exists two nonzero ideals I and J in LK(E) such that LK(E) = I ⊕ J.
The equivalence between (i) and (ii) of the following lemma is contained in the proof of [4,

Proposition 4.6] but is not stated explicitly. We provide a diﬀerent proof.

Lemma 5.1. Let K be a ﬁeld and E an arbitrary graph. Then the following are equivalent:

(i) LK(E) is decomposable.
(ii) There exist nonzero graded ideals I and J such that LK(E) = I ⊕ J.
(iii) There exists (H1, S1), (H2, S2) ∈ TE such that LK(E) = I((H1, S1)) ⊕ I((H2, S2)).

Proof. (ii) implies (i) is trivial. Now assume (i). Suppose LK(E) = I ⊕ J, where I and J are
not trivial ideals of LK(E). Since LK(E2) = LK(E), then LK(E) = I 2 ⊕ J 2 giving I = I 2
and J = J 2. By [1, Corollary 2.9.11], this is equivalent to saying that the ideals I and J are
graded, which implies (ii).

Finally (ii) and (iii) are equivalent by [1, Theorem 2.5.5].

(cid:3)

Theorem 5.2. Let K be a ﬁeld and E be an arbitrary graph. The following are equivalent:

(i) LK(E) is decomposable.
(ii) There exists nonempty clopen invariant subsets U and V in G(0)

E such that AK(GE) =

I(U) ⊕ I(V ).

(iii) There exists a nonempty, proper, hereditary and saturated subset H of E0 such that the

following conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) If x ∈ E∞ is such that x0 ⊆ E0 \ H, then there exists N ∈ N such that

Path(r(xN ), H) = ∅.

(b) If v ∈ E0 is such that |{e ∈ E1 | s(e) = v and Path(r(e), H) 6= ∅}| = ∞, then

v ∈ H ∪ BH .

(iv) There exists a nonempty clopen invariant subset U ( G(0)
E .

Proof. The equivalence between (i) and (ii) follows from Lemma 5.1 and Corollary 3.9. To
see that (iii) and (iv) are equivalent, notice that if H is as in (iii), then UH,BH is clopen
by Proposition 4.1 giving (iv). Conversely, if U is as in (iv), then there exists (H, S) ∈ TE
such that U = UH,S by Theorem 3.3. Since U is closed, H satisﬁes the conditions of (iii) by
Proposition 4.1.

L.O. CLARK, D. MART´IN, C. MART´IN, AND M. SILES

It is easy to see that (ii) implies (iv). Lastly, we show (iv) implies (ii). For U as in (iv) we

claim that we have a decomposition

AK(GE) = I(U) ⊕ I(G(0)

E \ U).

To see this, ﬁx f ∈ AK(GE) and deﬁne

f1(γ) =(f (γ)

0

if s(γ) ∈ U
otherwise

and f2(γ) =(f (γ)

0

if s(γ) ∈ G(0)
otherwise.

E \ U

Since U and G(0)
result.

E \ U are clopen, f1, f2 ∈ AK(GE). Observing that f = f1 + f2 gives the
(cid:3)

We ﬁnish by comparing our results to those in [4]. We point out that the statement of [4,

Theorem 4.2] is not correct. Consider the following example.

Let X = {un | n ∈ N} and Y = {wn | n ∈ N}. Then the only hereditary and saturated sets
are X, Y, ∅ and E0. Note that LK(E) is decomposable as LK(E) = I(X) ⊕ I(Y ) but X and
Y do not satisfy the conditions in [4, Theorem 4.2] because there are inﬁnitely many paths
starting outside of X ∪ Y and ending in X ∪ Y .

Theorem 6.5 below comes from combining the statements of [4, Proposition 4.5] and its
converse, [4, Proposition 4.6]. Here we give an alternative proof by showing the equivalence
between the graph condition in Theorem 5.2 and the graph condition in [4, Proposition 4.5]
(that also appears in [10]).

First we ﬁx some deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 6.2. ([4, Deﬁnition 4.1]) Let E be an arbitrary graph and H a hereditary and
saturated set of vertices. A path λ = λ1 . . . λ|λ|, where λi ∈ E1, is said to be H-compatible if
r(λ) ∈ H and s(λ|λ|) /∈ H ∪ BH.

Deﬁnitions 6.3. Let H be a hereditary and saturated subset of vertices in a graph E and
let v ∈ E0 \ H. We deﬁne the following sets:

Cv,H := {λ ∈ Path(E) | s(λ) = v and λ is H-compatible}.

We say that v satisﬁes Property (P) if |Cv,H| = ∞.

Lemma 6.4. Let K be a ﬁeld and E an arbitrary graph. Assume that LK(E) is decomposable
and let H be a hereditary and saturated subset satisfying conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 5.2
(iii). If v ∈ E0 \ H satisﬁes Property (P), then there exists e ∈ s−1(v) such that r(e) ∈ E0 \ H
and r(e) satisﬁes Property (P).

Proof. Decompose s−1(v) = A ⊔ B, where A := {e ∈ s−1(v) | r(e) ∈ H}. We claim that
B 6= ∅. By way of contradiction, assume B = ∅. We distinguish two cases. If |A| = ∞ then,
by condition (b) we have v ∈ H ∪ BH . Since we are assuming v /∈ H then v ∈ BH . But this
is a contradiction because B = ∅. Assume |A| 6= ∞. Note that |A| 6= 0 because v is not a
sink. Since H is a saturated set we have v ∈ H, a contradiction. Therefore B 6= ∅.

Case 1: the set A is inﬁnite. By condition (b) and since v /∈ H we have v ∈ BH. Note that
0 6= |B| (cid:12) ∞. Since |Cv,H| = ∞ and for every e1 . . . en ∈ Cv,H the edge e1 must be in B, then
there exists f ∈ B such that f γ ∈ Cv,H, for some γ ∈ Path(E) and r(f ) satisﬁes Condition
(P). In this case we are done.

Case 2: the set A is ﬁnite. We are assuming that |Cv,H| = ∞. Since v /∈ H ∪ BH, by
condition (b) the set of edges which are the ﬁrst edge of an H-compatible path is ﬁnite. In
this case, we repeat the same argument as before and ﬁnd f ∈ B such that f γ ∈ Cv,H, for
some γ ∈ Path(E) and r(f ) satisﬁes Condition (P). Again in this case we are done. This
ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

Theorem 6.5. Let K be a ﬁeld and E an arbitrary graph. Then LK(E) is decomposable if
and only if there exist two nontrivial hereditary and saturated subsets H1 and H2 such that
H1 ∩ H2 = ∅ and for every v ∈ E0 \ (H1 ∪ H2), there exists at least one but ﬁnitely many
paths starting at v which are either H1-compatible or H2-compatible.

Proof. Assume ﬁrst that there exists a hereditary and saturated subset H1 satisfying the
conditions in Theorem 5.2 (iii). Since UH1,BH1
is a clopen invariant set (by Proposition 4.1),
then G(0)
subset H2 such that

is also clopen invariant and therefore there exits a hereditary and saturated

E \UH1,BH1

G(0)

E \ UH1,BH1

= UH2,BH2

by Thereom 3.3.

Take v ∈ E0 \ (H1 ∪ H2). Note that v is not a sink since all of them are in H1 ∪ H2.
We ﬁrst show that there exists at least one path starting at v which is H1-compatible or
H2-compatible. By way of contradiction, suppose that this is not the case. We claim that
there exists e ∈ E1 such that s(e) = v and r(e) /∈ H1 ∪ H2. If v ∈ Reg(E) then there is an
edge e, starting at v, such that r(e) /∈ Hi because otherwise e would be an Hi compatible
path (for i = 1, 2). Assume v is an inﬁnite emitter. Then r(s−1(v)) 6⊆ H1 because in this
case every element in s−1(v) is an H1-compatible path, and we are assuming that this cannot
happen. For the same reason r(s−1(v)) 6⊆ H2. If there is a ﬁnite number of edges from s−1(v)
such that their ranges are inside Hi then each of them is an Hi-compatible path, arriving at
a contradiction. If s−1(v) = A ∪ B, where A and B are inﬁnite sets and r(f ) ∈ H1 for every
f ∈ A and r(f ) ∈ H2 for every f ∈ B then f is an H1-compatible path (in the ﬁrst case) or
it is an H2-compatible path in the second one, arriving again to a contradiction. In any case
we have our claim.

Fix e1 as before. Reasoning in the same way, for every n ≥ 2 we can ﬁnd en ∈ E1 such
that s(en) = r(en−1) and r(en) /∈ H1 ∪ H2. Deﬁne x = e1e2 . . . and apply that it is in

16

L.O. CLARK, D. MART´IN, C. MART´IN, AND M. SILES

UH1,BH1
exists at least one path starting at v which is either H1-compatible or H2-compatible.

. This implies that x ∈ UH1 ⊔ UH2, getting a contradiction. Thus, there

⊔ UH2,BH2

Now we show that the number of paths starting at v which are either H1-compatible or
H2-compatible is ﬁnite. By way of contradiction, and without loss in generality we may
assume that |Cv,H1| = ∞. By Lemma 6.4 there exists e1 ∈ E1 such that s(e1) = v, r(e1) /∈ H
and r(e1) satisﬁes Property (P). Applying the same reasoning to r(e1) we ﬁnd e2 ∈ E1 such
that s(e2) = r(e1), r(e2) /∈ H and r(e2) satisﬁes Property (P). Continuing in this way we ﬁnd
x = e1e2 · · · ∈ E∞ such that x0 ⊆ E0 \ H. Apply condition (a) to obtain that there exists
N ∈ N such that Path(r(eN ), H) = ∅, a contradiction as every vertex in x0 connects to H.

Conversely, assume that there exist hereditary and saturated sets H1 and H2 satisfying
the conditions in the statement. We prove that LK(E) is decomposable by showing that
conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 5.2 are satisﬁed for H1.

We start by proving that condition (a) in Theorem 5.2 is satisﬁed. Let x ∈ E∞ be such that
x0 ⊆ E0\H1. By way of contradiction, assume that for every n ∈ N we have Path(r(en), H1) 6=
∅. We claim that |x0| 6= ∞. Assume that this is not the case. Since s(xn) connects to H1,
it cannot be in H2 as H1 ∩ H2 = ∅. Then x0 ⊆ E0 \ (H1 ∪ H2). Since for every vertex in
E0 \ (H1 ∪ H2) there is at least one path which is H1-compatible or H2-compatible, if the
number of vertices in x0 is inﬁnite, then there are inﬁnitely many paths starting at s(x) which
are either H1-compatible or H2-compatible, a contradiction. Since |x0| is ﬁnite, there is a
cycle based at a vertex in x0, contradicting again that for any vertex in E0 \ (H1 ∪ H2) there
are ﬁnitely many paths which are either H1-compatible or H2-compatible.

Finally we prove that condition (b) in Theorem 5.2 is satisﬁed. Assume that there is
a vertex v such that |{e ∈ E1 | s(e) = v and Path(r(e), H1) 6= ∅}| = ∞. Denote by
C := {e ∈ E1 | s(e) = v and Path(r(e), H1) 6= ∅}. We prove that v ∈ H1 ∪ BH1. By way
of contradiction, assume v /∈ H1 ∪ BH1. For every e ∈ C, let µe be a path starting by e
such that r(µe) ∈ H1. We may assume that µe ∈ FE(H1). By the hypothesis there is only a
ﬁnite number of them which are H1-compatible. Therefore, there are inﬁnitely many which
are not H1-compatible. Fix one of these, say λ. Write λ = λ1 . . . λ|λ|, where λi ∈ E1. Since
λ ∈ FE(H1) we may say that s(λ|λ|) /∈ H1, therefore s(λ|λ|) ∈ BH1. Note that s(λ|λ|) /∈ H2
because otherwise r(λ) ∈ H1∩H2 = ∅. Apply that s(λ|λ|) /∈ H1∪H2 and the hypothesis to ﬁnd
an H2-compatible path ρ. Then λρ is H2-compatible. Now, the set {λρ} is an inﬁnite set of
H2-compatible paths starting at the vertex v, which is a contradiction to our hypothesis. (cid:3)
