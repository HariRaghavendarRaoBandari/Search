Recent advances in experimental and computational techniques have allowed for an accurate
description of the adsorption of ionic liquids on metallic electrodes.
It is now well established
that they adopt a multi-layered structure, and that the composition of the layers changes with the
potential of the electrode. In some cases, potential-driven ordering transitions in the ﬁrst adsorbed
layer have been observed in experiments probing the interface on the molecular scale or by molecular
simulations. This perspective gives an overview of the current understanding of such transitions
and of their potential impact on the physical and (electro)chemical processes at the interface. In
particular, peaks in the diﬀerential capacitance, slow dynamics at the interface and changes in
the reactivity have been reported in electrochemical studies. Interfaces between ionic liquids and
metallic electrodes are also highly relevant for their friction properties, the voltage-dependence of
which opens the way to exciting applications.

Solid-liquid interfaces play key role in many processes,
such as catalysis or electrochemical reactions, to mention
only chemistry and energy related applications. Despite
their importance, our understanding of the molecular-
scale structure of such interfaces, where all the essen-
tial (electro)chemical processes occur, has long remained
limited compared to the case of the corresponding pure
solid and liquid phases. Probing directly the interface in
experiments is indeed particularly challenging and com-
puter simulations are also more involved due to the sym-
metry breaking in the direction perpendicular to the in-
terface, which hinders the eﬃcient use of periodic bound-
ary conditions. Indeed, although simulating a few tens of
water molecules may be suﬃcient to investigate the bulk
properties of the liquid1, a similar number of molecules
results in ﬁnite-size eﬀects diﬀerent from that, physically
relevant, induced by the presence of the interface.

The past 10 years have witnessed the development
of many experimental techniques which are sensitive to
molecular arrangements at the interface, such as Scan-
ning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Sum-Frequency Gen-
eration (SFG), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), high-
energy X-ray reﬂectivity (XR) or Surface Force Appa-
ratus (SFA). They probe the structure of the liquid via
diﬀerent observables (vibrations, electron density, resis-
tance to shear, etc), thus providing complementary views
of the interface: For example the SFG signal is dominated
by the innermost adsorbed layer2–4, while AFM or XR
studies probe several layers of ﬂuid.5–8 In parallel, the ac-
cess to high performance computers and the development
of new algorithms9,10 also allowed to simulate more ac-
curately solid-liquid interfaces, shedding a new light on
interfacial processes such as adsorption. For example,
the combination of STM and Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations demonstrated that water molecules
adsorbed at metal surfaces exhibit a surprisingly rich
variety of structures11. Their arrangement depends on
the interplay between the geometry and energetics of the
water-metal interaction and of the hydrogen bonding be-

tween the water molecules, which varies strongly from
one metal to another (and even from one crystal plane of
a given metal to another) and with the water coverage
of the surface. This structuring impacts the dynamics
at the interface12 and ultimately the kinetics of electro-
chemical processes. Due to the range of length and time
scales involved, from the electron transfer event to the
local rearrangements of the interfacial ﬂuid, a full under-
standing of the water-splitting mechanisms from com-
puter simulations will therefore require bridging the gap
between ab initio13,14 and classical15 approaches.

Here we will focus on a particular class of electrolytes,
namely room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). They
are increasingly used in electrochemistry, with applica-
tions ranging from energy storage (batteries, supercapac-
itors) to electrodeposition16. Since they are made of ions,
their interfacial properties have long been interpreted fol-
lowing the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory. However, many
of the underlying asumptions are not valid due the very
high density of ions – an extreme case considering the ab-
sence of solvent in these liquids17–19. A signiﬁcant num-
ber of experiments and molecular simulations have thus
been devoted to the study of the interfaces of ionic liq-
uids with a solid6,20. The main conclusion arising from
XR, AFM, SFA and molecular dynamics (MD) is that the
structure perpendicular to the interface is characterized
by a strong layering of the liquid6,7,21,22, as expected for
a molecular liquid, which extends up to a few nanome-
tres. The local composition of the layers mostly depends
on the surface charge of the solid23 and displays strong
local correlations due to charge-ordering.

Many recent

studies on interfaces of RTILs

re-
ported intriguing results, highlighting the role of the
molecular structure within the adsorbed layers. As
pointed out in an editorial by Kornyshev and Qiao,

dimensionality of the interface24.

hexaﬂuorophosphate ([C4mim+][PF−
6 ]) with mica25 or
with vapor26. At electrochemical interfaces, the contact
between RTILs with an electriﬁed metal opens the way to
voltage-induced ordering transitions within the adsorbed
liquid. The universality of such transitions is far from
being established, in particular the extent of concerned
RTILs-substrate combinations should be clariﬁed. A ﬁrst
objective of this perspective article is therefore to sum-
marize the studies, both experimental and theoretical, in
which such transitions have been observed. We then dis-
cuss the impact of this ﬁnding on the physico-chemical
properties of the interface. In particular, the following
questions will be addressed: How can we detect struc-
tural transitions in experiments and in simulations? Is
there a templating action from the solid? What is the
main electrochemical signature of these transitions? Is
there an impact on the friction properties of the inter-
face? Some of these questions remain open and call for
further studies.

I. EVIDENCES FOR STRUCTURAL

TRANSITIONS AT IONIC LIQUID INTERFACES

A. Experimental studies

√

4 adlayer29.

To our knowledge, the ﬁrst studies dealing with inter-
facial phase transitions in Coulomb ﬂuids were conducted
by Freyland et al.27. Their in situ STM study of the in-
terface between the [C4mim+][PF−
6 ] and the (111) face
of gold reported the formation of Moir´e-like patterns at
potentials greater than -0.2 V with respect to a platinum
reference electrode. These were attributed to the forma-
tion of an ordered adlayer of PF−
6 . At negative poten-
3×√
tials, the STM images were consistent with the formation
a layer of anions with the (
3) structure, indicating
a two-dimensional ordering transition at this interface. It
is worth noting that these observations closely follow a
previous work performed on the adsorption of iodine from
aqueous solutions on similar gold surfaces28. A further
study by the same authors on the electrodeposition of
Cd on Au(111) in a chloroaluminate ionic liquid has also
revealed the formation of an ordered AlCl−
When changing both the nature of the anion (from
6 to BF−
PF−
4 ) and of the surface of gold in contact with
the RTIL (from (111) to (100)), Su et al. have also evi-
denced the existence of potential-driven ordering transi-
tions31. Increasing the potential from −0.3 V, an ordered
layer of anions is formed between −0.1 and 0.4 V. On the
contrary, when scanning in the negative potentials direc-
tion, they ﬁrst observed a loose ﬁlm-like layer which was
attributed to a disordered adsorption of C4mim+ cations.
Then, for potentials lower than −0.95 V, perpendicularly
oriented double-row strips were observed. These strips
were assigned to the formation of micelle-like arrange-
ments of aligned C4mim+ cations. These structures also
formed with PF−
3 anions, but not on (111)
surfaces of gold31, which shows that in this case a struc-

tural commensurability of the adsorbed layer and the
metal surface is necessary for the formation of ordered
structures.

This conclusion was conﬁrmed in a study using in
situ video-STM to probe the (111) Au interface with
a RTIL composed of a diﬀerent cation, namely 1-
butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium (BMP+) associated with
the bis(triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI−)30.
Stable images could only be obtained for negative poten-
tials below −1 V. For such potentials the images showed
the formation of ordered structures. Several distinct ar-
rangements of cations were proposed in order to inter-
pret the observations at various potentials; one of them
is shown in 1.

trast, the alkyl chains lie ﬂat on the surface only for the
lower charge density (hence lateral cation density in the
adsorbed ﬂuid) and extend into the perpendicular direc-
tion for the higher density. The lattice parameters for
the adlayer superstructure decrease accordingly and may
change symmetry, resulting for the densest packing in
a square lattice which diﬀers from the hexagonal sub-
strate. Finally, the video-STM furter allowed the ﬁrst
direct observation of the dynamical evolution of the ad-
sorbed liquid. In particular, it was found that the ﬂuctu-
ations occur mainly at the boundaries between ordered
domains.

All the structural transitions observed with STM have
so far involved Au electrodes because this metal can be
produced as single crystals with well-deﬁned surfaces.
Elbourne et al. have recently used another technique,
in situ amplitude-modulated AFM, to study interfaces
of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) instead32.
This substrate presents the advantage of having ﬂat sur-
faces with high area, and to avoid the surface reconstruc-
tions or etching which can occur in the case of gold31.
These authors studied the eﬀect of applied potential on
the adsorbed layer structure for a [C4mim+][TFSI−] ionic
liquid. At the open-circuit potential, well-deﬁned rows
are present on the surface. Unlike previous works, in
which the ordered structures were apparently formed of
only one type of ions, the unit cell is composed of an
anion-cation-cation-anion arrangement32. This structure
changes markedly with surface potential or when rela-
tively low concentrations of lithium or chloride ions are
present in the RTIL.

The variety of systems in which transitions are ob-
served clearly show that it is a common feature of
metal/ionic liquids interfaces. However, the few works
reported so far raise very interesting questions. In par-
ticular, all the ordered structures proposed so far to inter-
pret the STM data are composed of a single species only.
However, the relatively small applied potentials which
are used (∼ ±1 V) may not be suﬃcent to fully sepa-
rate cations from anions. In the case of the AFM study,
the anion-cation-cation-anion rows result in an overall
neutral layer but there is a strong charge imbalance on
the nanometre scale. A few hypotheses can thus be pro-
posed to explain the observations: i) there may be a spe-
ciﬁc absorption of the ions on gold with the formation
of partially covalent bonds33 ii) on top of the observed
layer, there could be an oppositely charged layer of ions
which is not observed by the experiment and iii) it re-
mains possible that the proposed structures, which are
only based on the relative size of the ions (keeping the
possibility of some kind of conformational ordering, for
example only the imidazolium rings of the cations would
lie parallel to the surface), are not the correct ones. Using
additional techniques such as SFG, which is sensitive to
the orientation of the ions4, could possibly shed a com-
plementary light on this issue. Another open question
is whether commensurability between the adsorbed layer

3

and the metal substrate is necessary to observe a transi-
tion. Here also, the recent study performed with HOPG
electrodes32 suggests that it is not the case, and that the
electric ﬂuctuations at an homogeneous and ﬂat metal-
lic surface are suﬃcient to trigger ordering transitions in
the interfacial layer of RTIL. In addition, the use of car-
bon electrodes in this study demonstrates that a perfect
metallic behavior is not necessary to induce such transi-
tions.

B. Computer simulations

In order to simulate electrochemical systems, it is nec-
essary to ﬁx the potential of the electrode. In classical
molecular dynamics or Monte-Carlo, this can be done
by various methods22. Our approach consists in treat-
ing the partial charges carried by the electrode atoms as
additional degrees of freedom which ﬂuctuate during the
simulation. Their values are determined at each time
step from a self-consistent calculation10,37,38.
In such
simulations, the electrochemical cell consists in a wide
slab of electrolyte held between two electrodes with dif-
ferent voltages. Like in experiments, the potentials are
not absolute. The only ﬁxed quantity is the potential
diﬀerence between the two electrodes ∆Ψ = Ψ+ − Ψ−,
although it is also possible to calculate the potential of
each electrode with respect to the bulk liquid in the case
of ﬂat electrodes; we will note this potential Ψelec/bulk.
In the following, we will assimilate an ordering transi-
tion to an abrupt change in the structure observed when
changing the potential. However, it is worth noting that
ﬁrst-order transitions are associated with a discontinuity
in an order parameter and a corresponding singularity
in a partition function, which are not easy to prove in
simulations39. This point will be further discussed in the
next section.

Using this simulation approach, a ﬁrst example of
voltage-driven transition was reported for a rather ex-
otic system,
formed with a high temperature molten
salt (LiCl) and an aluminum electrode with its (100)
surface in contact with the liquid34,40. An advantage
of this system is that a polarizable force ﬁeld could
be built directly from accurate DFT calculations using
a generalized force-matching approach40.For potential
drops Ψelec/bulk across the interface more negative than
−1.76 V, which corresponds to the point of zero charge
(PZC), the molten salt adopted a disordered structure at
the interface, while for larger potentials an ordered struc-
ture was obtained40. This structure, which is shown on
the top panel of 2, was commensurate with the aluminum
substrate, and a strong alignment of the dipole compo-
nents of the chloride anion and the normal of the sur-
face was observed for large potentials34. Interestingly, no
transition was observed when the plane of the metal was
changed to (110) instead of (100), but a diﬀerent ordered
structure was then obtained showing that an epitaxial
mechanism is at play, whereby the molten salt adapts it

structure to that of the electrode surface.

In a recent work, Kirchner et al. studied interfaces be-
tween primitive models of ionic liquids and solid surfaces
with various net charges (i.e. the electric potential was
not controlled)36. At certain charge densities (∼ −16 µC
cm−2) the structure of the adsorbed layer of cations un-
dergoes a structural transition to a surface-frozen mono-
layer of densely packed counter-ions with a Moir´e-like
structure. At lower surface charge densities (i.e.
lower
than −30 µC cm−2), they even observed the formation of
an herring-bone structure arising from the superposition
of two ordered monolayers of ions (see the bottom panel
of 2). These ﬁndings provide an interesting support for
the STM studies discussed above, but it is worth noting
that the charge densities employed are somewhat larger
than the experimental ones – they would correspond to

potentials which are above the electrochemical window
of typical RTILs.

Going towards more realistic models, an ordering tran-
sition was reported from molecular simulations for the
interface between [C4mim+][PF−
6 ] (for which a coarse-
grained force ﬁeld was used) and an electriﬁed surface of
graphite35. The presence of the ordered structure could
be monitored by computing the in-plane structure factor
in the ﬁrst layer of the adsorbed liquid. This structure
factor was liquid-like on a wide range of potentials, but
it showed some strong Bragg-like peaks suggesting a 2-
dimensional lattice-like organization for both the anions
and cations, which is shown in the top-right panel of 2.
This ordered structure contained on average as many an-
ions as cations, and it was also observed by Kislenko et al.

Snapshots of the ﬁrst two interfacial cation layers at the cathode at 450 K at a high value of the local compensation parameter, Cation= 2.37, showing the point ofstructural transition to an ordered structure within the second interfacial layer and thereby the construction of a herring bone structure. (Left) First interfacial layer, (middle)second interfacial layer and (right) ﬁrst and second interfacial layer merged.understood as the width of the ionic layer. We plot this quantityagainst Cation. A slight increase of FWHM1.maxwith temperatureindicates some widening of the EDL with increasing temperature.The resulting peak evolution over surface charge density (mea-sured by Cation) for anions at the cathode is shown in Fig. 3 for twodifferent temperatures (450 K and 500 K). Upon analysing the evo-lution of the position of the ﬁrst valley, a second transition pointat Cation= 2.38 (" = −38.0 ␮C/cm2) becomes visible, see also Fig. 5.The position is shifted from the expected 2.0 to 2.38 due to thecompression of the ordered layer under the high electrostatic ﬁeldfrom the electrode. Note that the ions are modelled as soft chargedLennard–Jones spheres.The valley position is nearly constant at z1.min= 2.0 nm at lowCationvalues (Fig. 3-top). At the transition points Cation= 1.0 andCation= 2.38, the valley position shifts in the z-direction furtherfrom the electrode by approximately 1.25 nm. Initially, the wholeco-ion layer is shifted by a larger distance than the diameter ofa counter-ion. However, at higher surface charge densities, theion layers are then squeezed in z-direction as indicated by thedecreased distance z1.min= 2.75 nm between the ion layer and theelectrode surface.The height of the minimum #1.mindecreases upon electrodecharging (Cation→ 0.5), thus indicating a less smeared appearanceof the ion layer as expected for higher surface charge density (Fig. 3-middle). However, before reaching the ﬁrst transition point, theheight of the minima increases. After the ﬁrst transition point thecycle of decreasing and increasing of the height of the minima startsover again.At the neutral interface and at the transition points Cation= 1.0and Cation= 2.38, the ﬁrst maximum (peak) of the anion numberdensity proﬁle becomes ﬂat and wide (Fig. 2). Thus the FWHM ofthe ﬁrst peak of the anion number density proﬁle is characterisedby noticeably larger values. With increased surface charge densitythe peak is narrowing that accounts for layering within the solutionpart of the EDL – the FWHM1.maxdecreases. This structural evolu-tion of the number density proﬁle, in terms of FWHM, is shown inFig. 3-bottom. The shapes of the FWHM1.max-curve in the intervalbetween the transition points look similar, thereby reﬂecting thesimilarity of the structural transition at both transition points.3.2. Vanishing charge waves at the transition pointTo analyse the RTIL response on electrode charging we discussthe cumulative charge proﬁles cnQ(z) =!z0#Q(z′)dz′(Fig. 4-left),where charge density proﬁles #Q(z) is deﬁned as a sum of the ionnumber density proﬁles #IonNmultiplied by the charge qIonof theionic species:#Q(z) = #CationN(z) · qCation+ #AnionN(z) · qAnion.As can be seen from the ﬁgure (Fig. 4-left) the cumulative chargeproﬁles reveal signiﬁcant oscillations between 0 < Cation< 1.0,which correspond to a multilayer structure.To investigate details of the charge compensation mechanismsin the EDL we plotted in Fig. 4-right the cumulative charge pro-ﬁles that are normalised by the number of elementary charges onthe electrode |qelectrode|. At lower charge densities (Cation< 1.0) thenormalised proﬁles cnQ(z)/|qelectrode| oscillate due to the so-calledoverscreening effect [32,13,70]. The height of the ﬁrst peak of theseoscillations that is more than 1.0 manifests that the number ofcounter-ions in the ﬁrst interfacial layer overcompensates the sur-face charge density at the electrode. However, at Cation= 1.0 thenormalised cumulative charge density proﬁle becomes a step-wisecurve with a ﬂat plateau where the proﬁle value is very close to1.0. That shows complete compensation of the electrode charge bythe ﬁrst monolayer of the counter-ions at this value of Cation. Theabsence of charge waves at Cation= 1.0 indicates that a non-orderedliquid phase coexists close to the ﬁrst interfacial monolayer.Upon further increasing of the surface charge density andthus reaching the values of the local compensation parametersCation> 1.0, charge waves are formed again. Alternating cation andanion layers start forming on top of the cationic monolayer. AtCation= 2.38 we observe a second structural transition with a two-step cumulative charge density proﬁle, see Fig. 5-left. As presentedin Fig. 5-right, the cumulative charge density proﬁle at the anodeshows a similar ﬂattening upon increasing Anion.3.3. 2D ordering of the monolayer at the transition pointSnapshots of the counter-ion structure at different Cationval-ues are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The transition from a multilayeredstructure of the EDL to a co-existence of counter-ion monolayer andunstructured RTIL can be understood as the formation of an orderedsurface-frozen structure close to the electrode [40].We found that the temperature effect on the interfacial structur-ing in our system is overall very week (see Fig. 3) for the consideredtwo temperatures. The interfacial structure of cations at the cath-ode near the transition point and of anions at the anode at thehighest surface charge density under study, are similar for the same values (see Fig. 4-right and Fig. 5-right).The observation of the ordered monolayer at  → 1.0 resem-bles the experimental ﬁndings of Freyland et al. [23,39] that reporta monolayer structure of PF−6anions adsorbed at Au(1 1 1) elec-trode surface. The overall picture of the structural transitions atthe electrode–RTIL interface observed in our simulation corre-lates well with the results of a recent theoretical work by Bazantet al. [70]. Indeed, the phenomenological theory introduced in thiswork predicts that “overscreening is pronounced at small voltagesand gradually replaced by the formation of a condensed layer ofSimpliﬁed ionic liquid / charged LJ wall @ -38 µC cm-2adsorbed on an uncharged surface of graphite41. By us-
ing importance sampling techniques, it could be shown by
Merlet et al. that this structure was the most stable one
for small positive potentials (∼ 0 < Ψelec/bulk <∼ 0.5 V)
and metastable for small negative electrode potentials. It
is worth noting that similarly to the experimental work
of Elbourne et al. involving HOPG electrodes, no com-
mensurability with the electrode surface seems necessary
to observe such ordered structures.

So far, no ordering transitions have been observed us-
ing more elaborate, all-atom models of RTILs in contact
with electrodes at ﬁxed potential. In particular, the ad-
sorption of [C4mim+][PF−
4 ] on elec-
triﬁed surfaces of gold was studied by Hu et al.,42 but
they did not report any ordering transition similar to the
experimental observations by STM.

6 ] and [C4mim+][BF−

These simulation results, while conﬁrming the possibil-
ity of transitions in the adsorbed layer of the ﬂuid, also
open their share of questions. Future works will need to
address the issue of ﬁnite-size eﬀects, since there must be
a commensurability between the formed ordered struc-
ture and the simulation cell. Timescales are important
too, since metastable states may be much longer-lived
than the typical simulation times, which are on the order
of the nanosecond only due to the computational cost.
There is therefore a possibility that the reported transi-
tions are artefacts of the simulation setups, but the sim-
ilarities with experimental ﬁndings seem to weaken this
hypothesis. The question of speciﬁc interactions with
surfaces such as gold will also have to be treated. This
requires in turn the development of accurate force ﬁelds
for this purpose. First steps in this direction have re-
cently been made in the case of carbon materials43.

IMPACT OF THE TRANSITIONS ON

PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

We now turn to the consequences of structural transi-
tions within the adsorbed ﬂuid on the physico-chemical
properties of the interface. Speciﬁcally, we discuss the
impact of voltage-induced transitions on the electrochem-
ical response of the electrode-RTIL interface in terms of
diﬀerential capacitance, cyclic voltammograms and elec-
trochemical reaction, as well as on the mechanical re-
sponse (solid-liquid friction).

A. Peaks in the diﬀerential capacitance

The diﬀerential capacitance Cdiﬀ measures the re-
sponse of the average surface charge density (cid:104)σ(cid:105) to
changes in the voltage ∆Ψ:

Cdiﬀ =

∂ (cid:104)σ(cid:105)

charge of the electrode reﬂects the composition and the
charge distribution within the interfacial liquid. As a re-
sult, one should expect a signature of abrupt structural
changes at voltages corresponding to putative phase tran-
sitions in the electrode charge, hence peaks in the corre-
sponding diﬀerential capacitance. While experimentally
such peaks have indeed been observed31,44,45, their pos-
sible link with changes in the structure or the interface
has been diﬃcult to demonstrate until recently, due to
the experimental challenges of in situ imaging and the
occurence of other processes such as surface reconstruc-
tion of the electrode.

Indeed, in their STM study of [C4mim+][BF−

4 ] on a
(100) gold electrode, Su et al. have also measured the
capacitance of the interface. They observed a ﬁvefold in-
crease in this quantity in the potential region of transition
from anion adsorption to cation adsorption. In the case
of the in situ video-STM study of the [BMP+][TFSA−]
on a (111) gold electrode30, thanks to the high tempo-
ral resolution or the video-STM technique, the authors
were able to visualize the evolution of the interfacial
ﬂuid during cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments. The
cyclic voltammogram displays two current peaks asso-
ciated with two surface transitions which could also be
linked to the formation of the ordered cationic structures,
such as the one shown on 1, upon increasingly negative
surface charge density.

In computer simulations, it is relatively straightfor-
ward to calculate the capacitance of the interface in con-
stant potential simulations. The generic method consists
in simulating an electrochemical cell at various voltage
and extracting the average surface charge. Then the
(cid:104)σ(cid:105) = f (∆Ψ) plot is diﬀerentiated, which provides the
diﬀerential capacitance through 1. However, close to a
transition, a large peak in the capacitance is expected,
so that many voltages should in principle be sampled in
this region. An alternative was recently proposed, which
consists in using importance sampling methods35,46. In
short, by using the whole distribution of surface charges
during the simulations, it is possible to sample the prob-
ability distributions of any variable as continuous func-
tions of the applied potential. There is in principle no
need to acquire more data close to the transition, the
only requisite is to have a good overlap between the his-
tograms of surface charges from the various voltages.
The probability distribution of the charge density σ of
graphite electrodes in contact with the [C4mim+][PF−
6 ]
ionic liquid35 obtained with this approach is shown on
3(a). The ﬁgure shows the probability distribution on a
logarithmic scale. It is clear that there are three branches
along which the distribution of the surface charge dis-
tribution shifts almost linearly upon increasing the po-
tential. These branches are separated by more complex
changes in the distribution around particular voltages.
We will focus on the one occuring at ∆Ψ = 0.9 V since
this is the potential for which the order-disorder transi-
tion discussed above occurs. 3(b) shows the distribution
P (σ) at three applied voltages (0.8 V, 0.9 V and 1.0 V).

They are characteristic of a ﬁrst-order phase transition.
Away from phase coexistence (at 0.8 V and 1.0 V), they
show the presence of “fat tails”, which are due to the
small probability of obtaining the metastable phase. At
the transition the distribution displays hints of bimodal-
ity, which is expected if the two phases are equiprobable.
However it would be necessary to simulate larger systems
to fully conclude on this point.

The diﬀerential capacitance computed from these sim-
ulations is shown on 3(c). Note that much better statis-
tics could again be obtained compared to the usual
method involving 1 by using the Johnson-Nyquist rela-
tion,

where S is the surface of the electrode and δσ = σ − (cid:104)σ(cid:105)
are the ﬂuctuations in the electrode surface charge den-
sity. A large peak in the diﬀerential capacitance is ob-
served at the applied voltage where the transition oc-
curs, which is consistent with the experimental ﬁndings
of Su et al. Note that again, larger systems should lead
to a singular charge-density transition in a macroscopic
limit39. Our simulations therefore conﬁrm that the pres-
ence of large peaks in experimental measures of the ca-
pacitance of an interface can indeed be the signature that
a potential-driven transition is occuring.

B. Hysteresis and slow dynamics

The above-mentioned domain boundaries between
phases also have important implications by themselves,
due to the entailed free energy cost. In three dimensions,
this would be a surface free energy. In the present case

the topology of the boundary between interfacial domains
at the surface of the electrode remains to be clariﬁed24.
As a result, annealing these boundaries, either between
grains of otherwise identical domains, or between diﬀer-
ent domains, requires overcoming the corresponding free
energy barrier.
In practice, the consequences of these
barriers are observable as long time scales in the dynam-
ics of the interface or as hysteresis in cyclic voltammetry.

Uysal et al.

reported a potential-dependent hys-
teresis at an electriﬁed graphene/RTIL interface47. X-
ray reﬂectivity measurements during cyclic voltamme-
try and potential step measurements are used to probe
the electronic density in the direction perpendicular
to an epitaxial graphene surface, within the adsorbed
[C9mim+][TFSI−] ionic liquid. The resulting proﬁles
were consistent with that obtained from MD simulations,
by assuming a combination of two limiting structures,
with weights varying as a function of applied voltage.
The structure evolves very slowly after a potential step,
with processes occuring over time scales exceeding 10 s.
In addition, the CV scans exhibit signiﬁcant (scan rate
dependent) hysteresis. While in this work the authors
safely indicated that the nature of the apparent bar-
rier and the associated mechanism require further inves-
tigation, these observations clearly point to the crucial
role of structural transitions and the associated domain
boundaries in the observed hysteresis and slow dynamics.
Another manifestation of slow processes occuring at the
ionic liquid / electrode interface was reported by Rol-
ing et al., who have carefully analysed the capacitance
spectra on a broad range of frequencies48,49. Although
no particular ordering transition was observed by STM,
these authors concluded that the slower capacitive pro-
cess could be related to structural reorganisations of the

Recently, Limmer proposed a detailed study of these
eﬀects using a coarse-grained model capturing strong
inter-ionic correlations50. Its limited computational cost
compared to molecular simulations allowed for a system-
atic ﬁnite-size scaling analysis, which demonstrated the
ﬁrst-order nature of the ﬂuctuation-induced transition
and spontaneous charge density ordering at the interface,
in the presence of an otherwise disordered bulk solution,
already observed in molecular simulations35. A crucial
step in this demonstration is the extensive growth of the
free energy barrier between phases analogous to the ones
observed in reference 47, which indeed implies hysteresis
and long time scales.

C.

Impact on reactivity

Structural changes in the ionic liquid at the interface
also have implications on the local environment of other
species in the liquid, in particular electro-active species.
This in turn may result in changes in their reactivity. A
direct observation of this feature has recently been re-
ported by Garcia-Rey and Dlott, who studied CO2 re-
duction on a polycrystalline Ag electrode, with 1-ethyl-
3-methylimidazolium tetraﬂuoroborate [C2mim+][BF−
4 ]
containing 0.3 mol% water as electrolyte51. Such sys-
tems have been shown to reduced the overpotential for
CO2 reduction. SFG and IR were used to probe the
surface ﬁeld experienced by the adsorbed CO molecules
produced by the electrochemical reduction of CO2. From
the CO Stark shift, a sudden increase of the ﬁeld at the
electrode surface was observed at the threshold poten-
tial for CO2 reduction, which could be traced back to
a structural transition within the RTIL – even though
no information could be obtained on the nature of these
structural changes. Nevertheless, this study illustrates
the potential beneﬁt of exploiting the peculiar structure
of ionic liquid interfaces and the voltage-driven changes
thereof (with potentially much greater diversity than in
solvent-based electrolytes) for electrochemical reactions.

layers is tuned by the electrode potential, from cation-

illustrates that these variations are directly linked to the
nature of the sliding plane, which may correspond to

tential and on the normal load exerted on the conﬁned
ﬂuid. While the voltage-driven structural changes on the
microscopic interfacial structures remain to be investi-
gated, such studies open the way to a new tuning of fric-
tional forces at the molecular scale without changing the
substrate.

More detailed information on the role of key micro-
scopic and macroscopic factors can be obtained using
molecular simulations, such as load, shear velocity, sur-
face topology and length of alkyl side chains in the ionic
liquid53.
Simulations with ﬁxed surface charge den-
sity (instead of potential) have further evidenced two
mechanisms underlying friction changes in such systems,
namely charge eﬀects on normal and in-plane ordering in
the ﬁlm, as well as swapping between anion and cation
layers at the surface54.

III. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

There is now a large body of experiments pointing to-
wards the existence of potential-driven transitions at the
interface between ionic liquids and metallic electrodes.
However, as discussed above, the exact structure and
composition of the ordered phases remain open questions.
Computer simulations bring some theoretical support on
the question, but they are still scarce because of the tech-
nical diﬃculty associated with the use of constant applied
potential ensemble. They also suﬀer from sampling issues
(both in size and time) which render the observation and
the characterization of the transitions diﬃcult. The cur-

rent works, in which the interactions are determined us-
ing classical force ﬁelds may also be limited if particular
bonding occurs at the interface. The recent inclusion of
constant voltage methods in DFT-based molecular dy-
namics packages55 may open new opportunities for tack-
ling this diﬃcult problem, as it was shown recently in the
context of nanotribology.56,57

In addition, the role of many parameters remain to
be established. For example, how do the composition of
RTIL and the possible presence of impurities aﬀect the
occurence of ordering transitions? What is the impact of
the temperature of the systems? Also many applications
of RTILs use them in the presence of a solvent, which
will also impact the whole structure of the electric dou-
ble layer. Finally, although it is clear that the nature
of the substrate plays a strong role, it is not sure that
there is always a commensurability between the ordered
structure of the liquid and the metal. Topological defects

at the surface of the metal may also play a predominant
role,58 and it is likely that corrugation eﬀects can mod-
ify the formation and/or the detection of ordered layers:
Recent simulations have shown that the heterogeneous
nucleation of ice at a surface depended markedly on the
morphology of the latter.59 Additional works with vary-
ing metal electrodes will allow to better understand these
issues.

Whether these transitions will have practical applica-
tions remains an open question, but they clearly impact a
lot the physico-chemical properties: peaks in the diﬀeren-
tial capacitances, slow dynamics at the interface, varying
reactivity and voltage-dependent friction properties have
already been reported. Overall such transitions reinforce
the view of RTILs as solvents with multifaceted proper-
ties, with a composition that can be speciﬁcally tailored
to a given task.
