ABSTRACT

NGC 1808 is a nearby barred starburst galaxy with an outﬂow from the nu-
clear region. To study the inﬂow and outﬂow processes related to star formation
and dynamical evolution of the galaxy, we have carried out 12CO (J = 1 − 0)
mapping observations of the central r ∼ 4 kpc of NGC 1808 using the Ata-
cama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Four distinct components
of molecular gas are revealed at high spatial resolution of 2(cid:48)(cid:48)(∼ 100 pc): (1) a
compact (r < 200 pc) circumnuclear disk (CND), (2) r ∼ 500 pc ring, (3) gas-
rich galactic bar, and (4) spiral arms. Basic geometric and kinematic parameters
are derived for the central 1-kpc region using tilted-ring modeling. The derived
rotation curve reveals multiple mass components that include (1) a stellar bulge,
(2) nuclear bar and molecular CND, and (3) unresolved massive (∼ 107 M(cid:12))
core. Two systemic velocities, 998 km s−1 for the CND and 964 km s−1 for the
500-pc ring, are revealed, indicating a kinematic oﬀset. The pattern speed of
the primary bar, derived by using a cloud-orbit model, is 56 ± 11 km s−1 kpc−1.
Non-circular motions are detected associated with a nuclear spiral pattern and
outﬂow in the central 1-kpc region. The ratio of the mass outﬂow rate to the
˙Mout/SF R ∼ 0.2 in the case of optically thin CO (1-0)
star formation rate is
emission in the outﬂow, suggesting low eﬃciency of star formation quenching.

Introduction

Inﬂows and outﬂows of baryons play important roles in galaxy evolution. In addition to
circular rotation, observations of the interstellar medium (ISM) using molecular spectroscopy
have revealed signiﬁcant non-circular motions of gas clouds in galaxies. These motions are
often observed in galaxies that exhibit non-axisymmetric gravitational potential due to spi-
ral and bar structures, and in those that undergo tidal interaction with their neighbours.
We consider the following four-step evolutionary process: (1) cold gas is transported to-
ward the galactic center by gravitational torques, i.e., by losing angular momentum, or by
accretion from intergalactic medium (IGM). One of the consequences of gas infall is the
crowding of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in nuclear rings at the outermost inner Lindblad
resonance (radius a few 100 pc), resulting in (2) eﬃcient feeding of star formation activity
(e.g., Athanassoula 1992b; Buta & Combes 1996; P´erez-Ram´ırez et al. 2000). Bursts of star
formation (starburst episodes), in turn, may trigger (3) outﬂows of ISM material (feedback)
that remove molecular gas via supernova explosions and stellar winds, thereby suppressing
further star formation in some regions while igniting it in others by outﬂow-induced shocks
(e.g., Chevalier & Clegg 1985; Schiano 1985; Murray et al. 2005, 2011; Veilleux et al. 2005;
Nath & Silk 2009; Bolatto et al. 2013a). Nuclear rings are also important gas reservoirs that
may fuel the central accretion disks via nuclear (secondary) bars or spiral arms down to a
scale of ∼ 10 pc (e.g., Garc´ıa-Burillo et al. 2005; Combes et al. 2014), though the mechanism
of angular momentum removal from kiloparsec to sub-parsec scale is not fully understood.
Finally, the expelled ISM can either fall back onto the galaxy as a fountain, or escape and
pollute the IGM with heavy elements, eventually (4) accreting onto another galaxy.

In order to study gas dynamics related to the inﬂow/outﬂow cycle in starburst galax-
ies and the evolution of GMCs in barred galactic disks, comprehensive observations are
necessary. While GMC-scale studies require angular resolution ∼ 100 pc or better, diﬀuse
outﬂows can be detected only in measurements with high surface-brightness sensitivity. This
is now readily achievable with the superb imaging capabilities of the Atacama Large Mil-
limeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) (e.g., Combes et al. 2013; Garc´ıa-Burillo et al. 2014;
Sakamoto et al. 2014). In this work, we have used ALMA to image the molecular gas traced
with the rotational line 12CO (J = 1 − 0) in the nearby (10.8 Mpc; Tully 1988) starburst
galaxy NGC 1808. As brieﬂy described below, the galaxy is a promising case-study target

– 3 –

that shows signatures of the feeding/feedback evolution in the nearby Universe.

NGC 1808 is a (R)SAB(s)a barred spiral galaxy (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) known
for peculiar “hot spots” in the star-forming central 500-pc region (Morgan 1958; S´ersic
& Pastoriza 1965), and prominent polar dust lanes (ﬁgure 1) revealed in optical studies
(Burbidge & Burbidge 1968; Phillips 1993) that indicate an outﬂow of dust and neutral gas.
The central region is dotted with radio and infrared sources revealing supernova remnants
and young star clusters (Saikia et al. 1990; Forbes et al. 1992; Krabbe et al. 1994; Kotilainen
et al. 1996; Tacconi-Garman et al. 1996; Galliano & Alloin 2008), while the galactic center
harbors a candidate for a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) (V´eron-Cetty &
V´eron 1985; Awaki et al. 1996; Jim´enez-Bail´on et al. 2005). Atomic gas traced with the Hi
21-cm line is concentrated in the galactic bar, disk, and a warped outer ring, indicating a
tidal interaction in the past (Koribalski et al. 1993, 1996). The galaxy has been observed
in CO before, although only with single-dish telescopes at low angular resolution of (cid:38) 22(cid:48)(cid:48)
(Dahlem et al. 1990; Aalto et al. 1994; Salak et al. 2014). In this work, we present the ﬁrst
high-resolution CO (1-0) and 2.8-mm band continuum data.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the observations and data
reduction. The results are presented in section 3, including the properties of the continuum
and CO (1-0) line emission on the galaxy scale, followed by discussion (sections 4, 5, and 6)
where we focus on the central 1-kpc molecular zone (CO gas distribution, kinematics, and
dynamics) and brieﬂy address the dynamics of the large-scale bar. A dynamical model is
introduced in section 4, extended by an analysis of the molecular gas outﬂow in section 5.
Finally, star formation is brieﬂy discussed in section 6. Analyses of the galaxy-scale GMC
properties and star formation in the bar are the subject of a forthcoming paper that includes
combined 12-m array, 7-m array (ACA), and total power data (Salak et al. in prep.). The
work is summarized in the last section.

The basic parameters of NGC 1808 are listed in table 1. The velocity in this paper is
deﬁned with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) in radio deﬁnition, and all images
are displayed in equatorial coordinates (α, δ)J2000.0.

2. Observations and data reduction

Observations were conducted on 2014 March 8, with twenty seven antennas of the
ALMA 12-m array as part of our cycle 1 project. The imaging was performed toward 39
ﬁelds combined into a 150(cid:48)(cid:48) × 150(cid:48)(cid:48) mosaic (about 7.5 × 7.5 kpc2 at the adopted distance
of 10.8 Mpc) shown in ﬁgure 2. The shortest projected baseline of the 12-m array was
Lmin ≈ 15 m, hence the visibilities that correspond to (u, v) (cid:46) 6 kλ, where λ is the observed
wavelength, were not sampled (see ﬁgure 3). The maximum recoverable scale per pointing
is θMRS (cid:39) 0.6λ/Lmin ≈ 21(cid:48)(cid:48); any structure larger than this is entirely ﬁltered out. The
longest baseline of the 12-m array was Lmax = 423 m, allowing sampling of high spatial
frequencies (angular resolution given by θ = kλ/Lmax, where k is a constant that depends
on the weighting function). The cycle 1 project includes supplement observations using the
Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and total power (TP) arrays needed to recover extended
emission and total ﬂux, and the combined data will be presented in a future paper. The
sources used as calibrators were: Callisto (ﬂux density), J0609-1542 (bandpass), and J0522-
3627 (phase). The total on-source time was about 41 minutes, but the integration time per
pointing was about 1 minute. Four spectral windows at the rest frequencies of (1) 101.271,
(2) 103.200, (3) 113.271, and (4) 115.271202 GHz (rest frequency of the rotational transition
CO 1-0) were observed simultaneously, each with a bandwidth of 2 GHz except window 4
which had a bandwidth of 1.870 GHz (4892.3 km s−1) and high spectral resolution of 976.56
kHz (2.548 km s−1) to resolve the CO (1-0) line.

Data reduction was carried out using the Common Astronomy Software Applications
(CASA) package (McMullin et al. 2007). The data were calibrated, continuum-subtracted,
deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with Briggs weighting. The CLEAN procedure
was carried out interactively until the residual map resembled pure noise. The iteration was
then proceeded automatically until a threshold of about 1 σ was reached. This threshold
was adopted by inspecting emission-free channels in the dirty map. As a result, despite a
relatively coarse (u, v) coverage, side lobes were successfully suppressed to negligible levels
comparable to 1 σ r.m.s. Two images were produced to analyze diﬀerent galactic scales: (1)
high-resolution image with robust = 0.5, velocity resolution of 2.548 km s−1, and spatial
resolution [the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the synthesized beam] of 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)26× 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)23
(117 pc× 64 pc) for the galactic central region where the signal-to-noise ratio is highest, and
(2) high-sensitivity image with robust = 2 and velocity resolution 10.192 km s−1 to increase
the sensitivity of extended structure over the entire mosaic. The angular resolution in the
ﬁnal data cube (robust = 2) is 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)55 × 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)41 (133 pc × 73 pc). The r.m.s. sensitivity of the
CO image in emission-free channels is 5.5 mJy beam−1 per velocity bin of 10.2 km s−1, or
about 0.14 K (1 σ) in brightness temperature units. The ﬁnal continuum image produced
by multi-frequency synthesis using four spectral windows after subtracting the contribution

– 7 –

from CO (1-0) has a sensitivity of 0.20 mJy beam−1. The continuum image was created with
robust = 0.5 weighting to achieve a compromise between angular resolution and sensitivity
expecting that emission is conﬁned to the galactic nuclear region. The images presented in
ﬁgures are not corrected for primary beam attenuation, except those of the central region.
The images were corrected, however, in order to derive ﬂuxes and masses.

Observational parameters are summarized in table 2.

3. Results

3.1. Continuum emission

Radio continuum in NGC 1808 was previously observed at low frequencies (20, 6, 3.6,
and 2 cm) that revealed several “hot spots” in the galactic central region (e.g., Condon 1987;
Saikia et al. 1990; Collison et al. 1994; Kotilainen et al. 1996). Our simultaneous observations
of four spectral windows (sub-bands with frequencies between 100 and 115 GHz) yielded
wide-ﬁeld, sensitive, high-resolution continuum images that add new information about the
complex starburst region (ﬁgure 4). In total, six sources were detected within r < 400 pc from
the galactic center with a signiﬁcance of > 3 σ and three sources with > 5 σ including the
nucleus (13 σ) and two circumnuclear hot spots. The circumnuclear sources are denoted by
C1-C5 in ﬁgure 4. The locations and ﬂux densities of all sources are derived by 2-dimensional
Gaussian ﬁtting and the results are presented in tables 3 and 4. Some of the sources are
unresolved as their shapes resemble the synthesized beam, but the nucleus appears slightly
extended toward east and north-east, as well as the elongated source C4 south-east of the
nucleus. The emission peak is located at (α, δ)J2000.0 = (5h7m42.s343,−37◦30(cid:48)45.(cid:48)(cid:48)95).

The ﬂux density Sν of the continuum emission can be expressed as a function of fre-
quency ν, Sν ∝ να, where α is the spectral index. Depending on the mechanism that
generates the continuum emission at the observed frequency, the spectral index can vary
from negative to positive values (e.g., Condon 1992). At 2.8 mm, we expect a combination
of free-free emission (nearly ﬂat frequency dependence), blackbody emission from dust grains
(positive α), and non-thermal synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons in magnetic
ﬁelds (negative α). To investigate the nature of the continuum emission in the nuclear re-
gion, we derived a spectral index distribution from two images, each produced by a synthesis
of two spectral windows: the upper-frequency image was produced from spectral windows 3
and 4 (113 and 115 GHz), denoted νu, while the lower-frequency image was produced from
spectral windows 1 and 2 (101 and 103 GHz), denoted νl. The spectral index, as the slope
of the spectrum between the two frequency sets, is deﬁned by

α(ν) ≡ log(Su/Sl)
log(νu/νl)

,

(1)

and the resulting α image is shown in ﬁgure 5. In the central r < 100 pc, the spectral index
varies in the range −3 (cid:46) α (cid:46) 1 with αcore (cid:39) −1 at the galactic center position. These
values indicate mixed free-free radiation in hot ionized gas, where α is typically close to
0 in optically thin Hii regions, and non-thermal synchrotron radiation from fast electrons
accelerated in, e.g., supernova remnants. In addition to free-free emission, ﬂattening of a
non-thermal radiation spectrum can occur due to self-absorption of synchrotron radiation.

The derived spectral index is similar to that of αcore = −0.9 found by Dahlem et al. (1990)
by comparing 20 and 6 cm images. By contrast, the compact sources that surround the
nucleus on average exhibit α (cid:38) 0. Such values of α can be produced in thermally-cooling
regions with free-free and dust-grain emission. In fact, the compact sources except the core
are not detected at the lower frequency, resulting in lower limits. The spectral index in
these obscured regions may also be aﬀected by optical depth and other variations in dust
properties.

From the derived values of α, we suggest that the nucleus is dominated by a high-
energy source, e.g., nuclear starburst accompanied with supernova explosions and/or a low-
luminosity AGN [indicated from optical and X-ray studies too, e.g., V´eron-Cetty & V´eron
(1985), Awaki et al. (1996), and Jim´enez-Bail´on et al. (2005)], conﬁrming the results from
previous radio-continuum observations (e.g., Collison et al. 1994). The circumnuclear sources
may be compact Hii regions, possibly associated with young star clusters embedded in dusty
clouds detected at infrared wavelengths (Galliano & Alloin 2008).

In ﬁgure 6 we show a comparison of our 2.8-mm continuum data with 3.6-cm continuum
sources and the most luminous nuclear X-ray sources at 0.3-0.9 keV (S1) and at 2-10 keV
(S2). The spectral indices of low-frequency sources indicate that their nature is supernova
remnants (Saikia et al. 1990; Collison et al. 1994). However, the 2.8-mm sources revealed in
ALMA images are only partially coincident with these objects, suggesting that the 2.8-mm
and 3.6-cm sources are not identical in most cases.

As for the X-ray data, S1 is obscured by a hydrogen column density of NH ∼ 0.6 × 1022
cm−2 and harbors a source with luminosity LX ∼ 1.5 × 1039 erg s−1 in the 2-10 keV band
(Jim´enez-Bail´on et al. 2005; Heike & Awaki 2007), somewhat lower than the low-luminosity
AGN in nearby galaxies [(0.4−50) × 1040 erg s−1; Terashima et al. 2002]. Although both
sources emit radiation in the hard X-ray band (S2 being more luminous with LX ∼ 9.2× 1039
erg s−1), only source S1 has a counterpart at 2.8 mm and longer wavelengths.

The distribution of radio sources around the nucleus (ﬁgure 6) indicates the presence of a
partial ionized gas ring (radius rion (cid:39) 7.5(cid:48)(cid:48) or 390 pc), inclination i (cid:39) 60◦, and position angle
P A (cid:39) 310◦, consistent with the global parameters of the galaxy (derived in section 4). As
we show below, the ionized gas ring lies on the inner edge of a pseudo-ring of molecular gas
detected in CO (1-0), and it is this inner region where most of the star-forming activity and
its feedback (supernova explosions) is taking place. Since our data were taken over a wide
mosaic ﬁeld, imaging was not restricted by the ﬁeld of view (except the lack of short-spacing
baselines); no 2.8-mm continuum emission is detected beyond the ionized ring.

NGC 1808. Molecular gas traced by CO (1-0) emission is detected throughout the galactic

disk (moment 0 deﬁned as ICO ≡ M0 = ∆v(cid:80)Si, where ∆v = 10.2 km s−1 and Si is the

CO (1-0) ﬂux density per beam, shown in ﬁgure 7a), with four distinct regions: (1) compact
circumnuclear disk (CND) or torus conﬁned to r < 200 pc (peak emission I max
CO = 41 Jy
beam−1 km s−1 in the high-sensitivity image), (2) pseudo-ring1 at 500 pc from the center,
(3) giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and associations (GMAs) in the large-scale bar, and (4)
GMCs in the disk where compact CO (1-0) emission is detected predominantly in spiral
arms. An illustration of the main structures of molecular gas is shown in ﬁgure 7. The
sensitivity of the CO (1-0) image (5.5 mJy beam−1) is equivalent to ∼ 7 × 104 M(cid:12), where
the luminosity-to-mass conversion was done using a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor of
XMW = 2×1020 cm−1(K km s−1)−1 (Bolatto et al. 2013b). The resolution and sensitivity are
suﬃcient to detect typical Galactic GMCs (4 × 105 M(cid:12); Young & Scoville 1991) in the disk
with 5 σ signiﬁcance. A comparison with a 2MASS (Two-Micron All Sky Survey; Jarrett et
al. 2003) image in Ks-band tracing old and middle-aged stellar populations (ﬁgure 7b) shows
that molecular gas is concentrated in the bulge region and the leading side of the large-scale
bar (ﬁgure 7c).
In the central starburst zone, CO is detected in the region between the
500-pc ring and the CND in a nuclear disk with complex morphology and kinematics. We
begin by describing the details of the large-scale morphology.

3.2.1. Large-scale bar and spiral arms

Outside the central starburst region, molecular gas is concentrated in a bar (semi-major
axis ab (cid:39) 3 kpc estimated from the Ks-band image; ﬁgure 7b) and global spiral arm pattern
(illustrated in ﬁgure 7c). The position angle of the bar is P Abar (cid:39) 335◦, about 10◦ higher
than the position angle of the galactic disk.

The most prominent feature of CO (1-0) emission in the bar is the concentration of
molecular clouds along the “oﬀset ridges” spatially correlated with the dust lanes on the
leading side of the bar. These structures have been observed in numerous barred galaxies
and have been reproduced by numerical and analytical calculations including the cloud
orbit and hydrodynamical shock-wave models (e.g., Contopoulos 1980; Binney et al. 1991;
Athanassoula 1992a,b; Lindblad & Lindblad 1994; Wada 1994; Sakamoto et al. 1999; Sheth et

al. 2000; Hirota et al. 2014; and others). In the cloud orbit model, the lanes are a consequence
of oval orbits of gas clouds in the bar potential. Upon crossing the bar region, the clouds
orbiting in the galactic disk gain inward motion as seen from the rotating frame. Orbit
crowding leads to increased gas concentration manifested in stronger CO (1-0) emission and
dust extinction.

At other wavelengths, the bar is also rich in Hi gas and dotted with Hii regions revealed
in Hα (Koribalski et al. 1996). Enhanced intensity of the higher CO transition J = 3 → 2
was also detected along the bar using the single-dish telescope ASTE (Salak et al. 2014).

In ﬁgures 8 and 9, we show a large-scale comparison of CO (1-0) observed by ALMA
and a high-resolution HST image of Hα. Outside the luminous starburst nucleus, we ﬁnd
that the bar harbors a number of large concentrations of molecular gas spatially correlated
with Hα. Consider, for example, a clump of CO gas marked with arrow in ﬁgure 9 (S panel).
The integrated intensity enclosed within r < 10(cid:48)(cid:48) from the CO emission peak of this cloud
is ICO = 46 Jy km s−1. Using a CO-to-H2 conversion formula (with a Galactic conversion
factor), introduced in the next section, this yields a mass of Mmol ≈ 6× 107 M(cid:12). The object
is a giant molecular association (GMA), and the comparison with Hα shows that it is a site of
star formation inside the bar. Similar masses can be derived for the GMAs in the north too,
where Hii regions are located in nearly a straight line aligned with the major axis of the bar.
This behavior has been reproduced in recent numerical simulations where molecular clouds
in bars form star-forming GMAs through merging and collisions (Fujimoto et al. 2014).

Outside the bar, individual GMCs can be identiﬁed in the disk, many of which are
concentrated in structures that resemble a spiral pattern (ﬁgure 7c). In particular, several
arms are connected to the bar and emerge from its ends, with notable asymmetry in the
density of GMCs and Hii regions: there are more molecular clouds and star-forming regions
on the trailing side of the bar, especially around the NW semi-major axis. We leave a more
quantitative analysis of the relation between CO and star-forming tracers to a future work
that includes the short-spacing correction.

3.2.2. Gas surface density in the central starburst region

The CO (1-0) emission is prominent in the central r (cid:46) 800 pc (ﬁgures 10 and 11).
Emission peaks in the CND (ICO = 34 Jy beam−1 km s−1 in the high-resolution image) and
in a 500-pc pseudo-ring that is part of a two-arm spiral. Molecular gas is also present between
the center and the ring, where infrared observations reveal an embedded nuclear stellar bar
at a position angle of (cid:39) 335◦ (Kotilainen et al. 1996; Tacconi-Garman et al. 2005). Note
that the nuclear bar is well aligned with the large-scale bar. This is not a usual conﬁguration
as the bars in double-barred galaxies show random relative position angles, while diﬀerent
angular velocities of the two bars are produced in simulations (Heller et al. 2007). In the
dynamical evolution, the nuclear bar is expected to change its pattern speed (e.g., accelerate
its rotation during an alignment event) and possibly oscillate in thickness and ellipticity as
the two bars constantly change the position angle with respect to each other (Debattista &
Shen 2007; Maciejewski & Small 2010). Interestingly, there is no clear spatial correlation
between the nuclear bar and the molecular gas distribution traced by CO: molecular gas is
not following the bar with prominent ridges (as it is on the kiloparsec scale), but instead a
nuclear spiral pattern indicated in ﬁgure 10. The spiral arm can be seen west and south-west
of the nucleus at a radius of r ∼ 200 pc (3.8(cid:48)(cid:48)); it is spatially correlated with a dust lane
visible as extinction on the HST image.

The mass of molecular gas in the central region can be calculated from Mmol = 1.05 ×
104(XCO/XMW)d2SCO∆v [M(cid:12)], where XCO is the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, d distance to
the galaxy in Mpc, SCO measured ﬂux density in Jy, and ∆v velocity width (e.g., Bolatto et
al. 2013b). Adopting a low conversion factor of X = 0.8×1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1, estimated
by Salak et al. (2014) for the central 1-kpc region of this galaxy using a radiative transfer
analysis (kinetic temperature Tk = 35 K and gas density nH2 = 103.5 cm−3), d = 10.8 Mpc,
and measured SCO∆v = 281 Jy km s−1, we ﬁnd a molecular gas mass (including He) of
Mmol(r < 250 pc) (cid:39) 1.4 × 108 M(cid:12) in the CND region. With a standard Galactic conversion
factor of 2 × 1020 cm−2K−1(km s−1)−1, the mass is 3.4 × 108 M(cid:12). This is about 23% of the
total molecular gas mass in the central r < 780 pc detected with the 12-m array. The total
CO (1-0) ﬂux detected over the 150(cid:48)(cid:48) × 150(cid:48)(cid:48) mosaic image is 1521 Jy km s−1 (corrected for
primary beam attenuation) corresponding to 1.9 × 109 M(cid:12). This is comparable to the total
atomic gas mass (MHi = 1.7 × 109 M(cid:12)) over the central ∼ 4(cid:48) estimated by Koribalski et al.
(1993) from their large-ﬁeld Hi maps. All ﬂux values are lower limits because short-spacing
correction has not been applied. The masses are summarised in table 5.

on the mass-to-light conversion factor XCO ∝ Σmol/ICO ∝ Mmol/LCO, where LCO is the
CO (1-0) luminosity. The total molecular gas mass corrected for He and heavy elements is
Σmol = 1.41ΣH2 for the fractional abundance of hydrogen nuclei of 71%.

The measured ﬂux density at the galactic center (34.5 Jy beam−1 km s−1) yields a
mol = 1.1 × 103 M(cid:12) pc−2 if the low conversion factor XCO = 0.8 ×
peak surface density of Σmax
1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1 is applied (Salak et al. 2014). In the central 1-kpc region, we derived
azimuthally averaged surface density Σmol as a function of radius by using the MIRIAD task
ELLINT to ﬁnd average ﬂux densities in rings and then applied equation 2. The result is
shown in ﬁgure 11; the high surface density of Σmol = (102 − 103) M(cid:12) pc−2 is typical for
starburst galaxies (Kennicutt 1998) and implies a column density of NH = (1022−1023) cm−2
that explains the obscured nature of the central region. The parameters used to determine
the ellipses were P A = 324◦, i = 58◦ (derived in section 4.1), and radius increments of
∆R = 1.13(cid:48)(cid:48) (equal to θmaj/2). The resulting curve can be ﬁt with two Gaussian functions of
the form a exp[−(R− b)2/(2c)2] that correspond to the nuclear concentration (CND) and the
ring. The oﬀset parameter becomes bCND = 0(cid:48)(cid:48) for the CND (corresponding to the galactic
center) and bring = 9(cid:48)(cid:48) for the ring. This radius corresponds to 469 pc, which we adopt as the
radius of the ring. The standard deviations are cCND = 2(cid:48)(cid:48) (104 pc) and cring = 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)9 (203 pc).

GMC velocities in the galactic disk and large-scale bar. An intensity-weighted velocity ﬁeld

integrated over narrow velocity bins (channel maps) of the entire mosaic and the central
2(cid:48)region are shown in ﬁgures 13 and 14, respectively.
In addition to large-scale rotation,
molecular gas in the bar region exhibits peculiar motion evident as a large velocity gradient
over the entire ridges on the leading side of the bar. This was noticed in Hi data by Koribalski
et al. (1996), and we show that CO is following a similar trend. The velocity ﬁeld in the oﬀset
ridges shows a velocity gradient (shear) of vsh ≡ ∆v/∆l ∼ 0.2 km s−1 pc−1, or ∆v ∼ 100
km s−1 across the ∆l ∼ 500 pc wide ridges (in azimuthal direction perpendicular to the
galactocentric radius).

3.3.2. Velocity ﬁeld and dispersion in the central 1 kpc

The velocity ﬁeld (moment 1) in the central region is shown in ﬁgure 15 (left). It appears
slightly distorted, with the largest deviation ∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48) south and south-west of the center. Note
the overall “S”-shape pattern, typical in galaxies with bars.

M2 = (cid:112)(cid:80)Si(vi − M1)2/M0 (where M0 and M1 are the zeroth and ﬁrst moments deﬁned

The velocity dispersion of molecular gas, deﬁned as the second moment of intensity,

above), is shown in ﬁgure 15 (right). On average, M2 is high (above 40 km s−1) in the
nucleus and decreases to 10-20 km s−1 in the central disk. It rises again to 15-25 km s−1 in
the 500-pc ring and then decreases once more beyond the ring in the galactic disk.

Velocity dispersion can be an indicator of cloud (orbit) crowding. The dispersion is
especially high (σ > 40 km s−1) north and north-east of the nucleus. By inspecting the
CO spectra in this region (ﬁgure 16), we ﬁnd double peaks within the synthesized beam
(∆l (cid:39) 90 pc). These features are not obvious in moment 1 images because the velocity
is intensity-weighted. The moment 1 images do, however, show the S-shape and a steep
velocity gradient north and south of the 500-pc ring. The proﬁles of the emission lines are
somewhat aﬀected by missing short-spacing baselines, but such eﬀects cannot produce the
observed line width because the negatives and sidelobes are weak. Note that this region
is where the gas in the outer x1 orbits of the bar passes close to the 500-ring, where we
expect to ﬁnd an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and x2 orbits (section 4.2.2). The large

velocity widths (separations between the peaks in the spectra, W ∼ 100 km s−1) indicate
that the velocity gradient (shear) is high near the ILR, vsh ∼ W/∆l ∼ 1 km s−1 pc−1, a
factor of several higher than in most of the ridge at larger radii. The gradient could disrupt
the GMC structure, since the internal escape velocity of a cloud with radius R = 10 pc and
2πGRΣ ≈ 7 km s−1. The disrupted material may be in the

form of low-density molecular gas unable to produce stars (e.g., Downes et al. 1996). We

the ILR, consistent with this suggestion. A similar trend is observed at the south end of the
ring too, although the emission is weaker and W ≈ 80 km s−1.

4. Gas dynamics

Detection of CO (1-0) in the central starburst region, kpc-scale bar, and spiral arms
allows us to study gas dynamics in detail. In this paper, we focus primarily on the central
1-kpc region and derive basic geometric and kinematic parameters of molecular gas. On the
large scale, we derive the bar pattern speed, and use it to locate the Lindblad resonances
and corotation. Since the data presented here were taken with the 12-m array, i.e., without
short-spacing baselines, extended structures such as arm/inter-arm regions and outﬂows are
not fully sampled. We will discuss those features in detail in a future work that includes a
short-spacing correction.

4.1. Derivation of geometric and kinematic parameters in the central 1 kpc

To determine the basic geometric and kinematic parameters of the central 1-kpc molec-
ular zone, we used the program 3DBarolo (3D-Based Analysis of Rotating Objects from Line
Observations) that ﬁts tilted-ring models to (3-dimensional) spectroscopic data (Di Teodoro
& Fraternali 2015). The main parameters of the galaxy include the dynamical center at
(x0, y0), systemic velocity (vsys), rotational velocity (i.e., rotation curve vrot), gas velocity
dispersion (σmol), galactic inclination (i), and position angle (P A). The program compares
models with a data cube by ﬁtting rings at various radii from the center. All parameters
may vary from one ring to another, including inclination and position angle, thereby allowing
a warp, i.e., a set of tilted rings with diﬀerential rotation (e.g., Rogstad et al. 1974). The
computation, however, does not handle non-circular motion (e.g., radial motion due to spiral
arm and bar dynamics, outﬂows from starburst and AGN feedback). The aim to use the
program in this work is to ﬁt circular motion components so that we can produce a model
and then subtract it from the data. The residuals would reveal non-circular features.

4.1.1. Parameter computation

The high-resolution data cube (∆v = 2.5 km s−1) was used in this procedure. The
calculation was carried out within 12 rings of equal width ∆r = 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)13 = θmaj/2 (where θmaj
is the FWHM of the synthesized beam along its major axis) from the center to 12.(cid:48)(cid:48)4 (646
pc), i.e., to the radius that comfortably covers the central molecular ring; beyond this radius
the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the inﬂuence of the galactic bar is too high to derive
reliable results by assuming circular orbits. The gas scale height (disk thickness) was kept as
a non-free parameter at hz = 150 pc. In a disk with a Gaussian density proﬁle perpendicular

– 34 –

to the galactic plane, this parameter is related to the gas velocity dispersion and surface
mol,z(2πGΣmol)−1, where σmol,z is the velocity dispersion in the z direction.
density as hz = σ2
For σmol,z = 20 km s−1 and Σmol = 300 M(cid:12) pc−2, typical in the central region (e.g., ﬁgures
11 and 15), the scale height is hz ≈ 150 pc. The parameter may vary by a factor of a few in
the central region, though it makes negligible eﬀect on the ﬁtting result.

Although the program is able to guess all the parameters as functions of radius r si-
multaneously, we constrained the computations by providing the central position (x0, y0) to
be the location of the peak of 2.8-mm continuum emission (assuming that it coincides with
the low-luminosity AGN candidate). This is a reasonable choice because the CO peak has
been found oﬀset from this position and more extended than the continuum source. Unlike
continuum, CO is likely to exhibit a torus structure that can be oﬀset [e.g., in the Seyfert
galaxy NGC 1068; Krips et al. (2011) and Garc´ıa-Burillo et al. (2014)]. In addition, we have
constrained the galactic inclination to the literature value of i = 57◦ ± 5◦ (table 1), where
the uncertainty is included to allow the program freedom to explore a range of 10◦.

4.1.2. Systemic velocity

The program estimated the systemic velocity as a non-free parameter. This is calculated
as the mid-point between the velocities that correspond to the 20% of the peaks of the CO
(1-0) line proﬁle. The proﬁle within the central 40(cid:48)(cid:48) × 40(cid:48)(cid:48) box (2.08 × 2.08 kpc2) is shown in
ﬁgure 17 together with a spectrum of CO (3-2) acquired with the single dish telescope ASTE
(Salak et al. 2014). The derived systemic velocity is vsys = 963.9 ± 2.5 km s−1 within the
central region, in agreement with previously reported values measured with a large telescope
beam that did not resolve the central 1-kpc region (965 km s−1; Aalto et al. 1994). A similar
value of 965± 5 km s−1 was derived when we applied the ﬁtting procedure on the ASTE CO
(3-2) data cube and when the center position was not ﬁxed.

Note that the CO line proﬁles exhibit a triple peak in the central region (ﬁgure 17).
The triple peak can be decomposed into the 500-pc ring and nucleus. It is clear from the CO
(1-0) spectrum of the central r < 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 in ﬁgure 17 that the central peak corresponds to the
nucleus. Applying the same procedure of systemic velocity computation, we ﬁt 3 rings at
radius increments that correspond to the beam width up to 235 pc (two times the major axis
of the beam FWHM) and ﬁnd a best ﬁt at vsys = 998.4 ± 2.5 km s−1, more than 30 km s−1
higher than vsys derived from global kinematics. This discrepancy, ﬁrst noticed by Burbidge
& Burbidge (1968), is also obvious in the position-velocity diagrams discussed below (ﬁgure
24).

– 35 –

A comparison of the CO (1-0) and CO (3-2) spectra in ﬁgure 17 can be used to estimate
the missing ﬂux in the ALMA data. Although the ratio of the intensities of the two lines,
deﬁned as R31 ≡ I3−2/I1−0, varies on small scale, Aalto et al. (1994) and Salak et al. (2014)
found that, on average, R31 ≈ 0.6 in the central kiloparsec. Then, one should multiply the
CO (3-2) spectrum in ﬁgure 17 to obtain a CO (1-0) spectrum corrected for the short-spacing
baselines. The resulting missing ﬂux in the ALMA data could be as high as ∼ 40% in the
central 2 kpc region. Although the unrecovered ﬂux is substantial, we note that this is likely
much lower at the scale of the CND (2(cid:48)(cid:48)), which is ten times smaller than the maximum
recoverable scale of the imaging (21(cid:48)(cid:48)). Also, the presence of the central peak in the single
dish spectrum at a velocity shifted from the global systemic velocity by ∼ 30 km s−1 suggests
a kinematic oﬀset.

Another method to calculate vsys is to use a dense gas tracer in the central galactic
region. The HCN (4-3) line proﬁle acquired with ASTE (see Appendix) was ﬁtted with a
Gaussian function that yielded a peak velocity of 998.6 ± 3.3 km s−1, consistent with the
nuclear component of the ALMA CO (1-0) spectrum and the central peak in the CO (3-2)
spectrum. This velocity is also consistent with estimates from optical studies [e.g., nuclear
heliocentric velocity of 1020 km s−1 in V´eron-Cetty & V´eron (1985) and Phillips (1993)]
Therefore, for the central galactic region (r < 235 pc), we suggest that the higher vsys is
appropriate.

The origin of the kinematic oﬀset is not clear. One possibility is that the bulge is
composed of two components: a massive inner component that dominates the dynamics of
gas in the CND, and a larger component that determines the gas motion in the central 2
kpc, and that these two do not have a single dynamical center, possibly a consequence of
a tidal interaction in the past (also evident as a warped outer ring; e.g., Koribalski et al.
1993).

4.1.3. Position angle

The position angle is determined by ﬁnding a line that maximizes the velocity gradient
in the observed image. The computation constrained P A to the range of 302◦ < P A < 320◦
(when vsys = 998 km s−1), as shown in ﬁgure 18. In the central r < 400 pc, the best ﬁt
is found for (cid:104)P A(cid:105) (cid:39) 316◦. By applying the same method to derive P A for vsys = 964 km
s−1, an average value of 324◦ was found – the central region exhibits a warp of ∼ (5◦−10◦)
from the CND to the 500-pc ring. The position angle (and inclination) are consistent with
the results based on Hi data within r (cid:46) 120(cid:48)(cid:48). The position angle remains P A ∼ 300◦ until
r ∼ 300(cid:48)(cid:48), whereas inclination gradually decreases beyond r (cid:38) 120(cid:48)(cid:48) reaching i ∼ 30◦ at
r ∼ 300(cid:48)(cid:48); this is manifested as the warped outer ring (Koribalski et al. 1993). To compare
this result with the distribution of stars in the galactic bulge, we ﬁtted the 2MASS Ks-band
image (ﬁgure 7b) with a two-dimensional Gaussian function within the central r < 30(cid:48)(cid:48). The
resulting P A was 323.◦69± 0.◦48, remarkably close to that derived from CO for vsys = 964 km
s−1. We adopt the value of 324◦ for the major axis of the 500-pc ring and galactic bulge.

4.1.4. Rotation curve and dynamical mass

High-resolution CO line observations are useful for deriving rotation curves and mass
distributions in the central regions of galaxies (e.g., Sofue & Rubin 2001; Sofue 2013). CO
gas is often abundant and detectable with ALMA in the central regions where Hi emission is
weak and Hα aﬀected by extinction. The data presented in this work have high resolution and
sensitivity to probe the gas kinematics in the galactic bulge region with spatially continuous
CO detection from the nucleus to the 500-pc ring. We ﬁrst derive a rotation curve (vrot) by
using 3DBarolo and then analyze its composition.

The rotation curve derived by computation using vsys = 998 km s−1 is plotted in ﬁgure
19. It can be decomposed into three parts: the nucleus (r < 1(cid:48)(cid:48)), a steep rise at 1(cid:48)(cid:48) < r < 3(cid:48)(cid:48),
and a more gentle rise beyond that radius. This change of slope is not a consequence of
change in i or P A because these parameters are calculated separately and included in the
derivation of vrot. The last three measurement points are less reliable because the 500-pc ring
exhibits a diﬀerent systemic velocity of 964 km s−1 and because gas dynamics is dominated
by streaming motion in the global bar. The outermost values, however, are in agreement with
Hi data from Koribalski et al. (1993) and the result in Sofue et al. (1999) within uncertainty.
The rotational velocity at the radius of r = 705 pc, derived by using the systemic velocity
vsys = 964 km s−1, is vrot (cid:39) 215 km s−1. The results of modeling of gas kinematics inside
the nuclear ring (derived by using vsys = 998 km s−1) are summarized in table 6.

Assuming a simple spherically symmetric mass distribution, the derived rotational ve-
rot/G (cid:39) 7.5 × 109 M(cid:12). By
locity yields a dynamical mass of Mdyn(r < 705 pc) = rv2
comparison, the total velocity-integrated ﬂux in the same region is SCO = 991 Jy km
s−1 and the molecular gas mass derived by using the CO-to-H2 conversion factor XCO =
0.8 × 1020 cm−2(K km s−1)−1 becomes MH2 (cid:39) 5 × 108 M(cid:12) [see also Salak et al. (2014) for
a derivation using CO (3-2)]. The dynamical mass distribution is shown as a function of
radius in ﬁgure 19 (right).

Next, we try to decompose the mass distribution into components that can explain the
observed rotation curve. Since the rotation curve sampled at ﬁne spacing of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)13 shows
extreme changes in slope that require multiple mass components and are likely aﬀected by
non-circular motion (eﬀective on a scale of (cid:46) 2(cid:48)(cid:48); section 4.2 and ﬁgure 24), we “smooth”
the curve by re-deriving the velocity at increments of 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)26 (equal to θmaj). The resulting
curve can be ﬁt by a crude model of two massive systems in the central 1 kpc. The larger
one is the stellar bulge, while the smaller one denoted by major core (scale radius 95 pc)
can be a simpliﬁed version of the nuclear bar and the molecular CND, which has a mass of
(cid:38) 1.4 × 108 M(cid:12) in the central 300 pc and should be included in velocity curve calculations.
The bulge and major core are represented by a simple Plummer sphere model (Plummer

Φ(r) = − GM1(cid:112)r2 + a2

The total rotation curve due to both systems, expressed as vrot(r) = (cid:112)v2

2(r), is
plotted in ﬁgure 20. We also include a nuclear star cluster with mass MC = 1.4 × 107 M(cid:12)
and scale radius aC = 4.5 pc, indicated from high infrared luminosity of the core (e.g., Oliva
et al. 1995; Tacconi-Garman et al. 1996; Galliano & Alloin 2008). The selected scale radius
corresponds to a core radius (where the surface density drops to the half of its maximum)
2 − 1a ≈ 3 pc, a typical value for nuclear clusters in nearby galaxies (Walcher et
of rc =
al. 2005). The derived mass of the bulge+major core (MB = 1.32 × 1010 M(cid:12)) is consistent
within 5% with the bulge mass derived by Sofue et al. (1999) by decomposing a kpc-scale
rotation curve. In addition, a rotation curve that includes a tentative central supermassive
black hole (mass MBH = 1.2 × 107 M(cid:12), or about thrice as massive as the Galactic one;
Gillessen et al. 2009) is shown too; the black hole has a Keplerian rotation curve. It is not
clear whether NGC 1808 has a supermassive black hole in its center, but ﬁgure 20 shows
that it would not be distinguished from the star cluster of the same mass at the present
resolution of 100 pc. For a bulge mass of MB1 = 1.25 × 1010 M(cid:12), the black-hole-to-bulge
mass ratio is of the order MBH/MB1 ∼ 1× 10−3, consistent with large samples in Kormendy
& Ho (2013). Note that even if a black hole and a nuclear cluster coexist as a core2 of mass

2Supermassive black holes and nuclear clusters seem to coexist in many galaxies and the ratio of their
masses can vary by three orders of magnitude. In the Galaxy, the mass of the black hole is only ∼ 15% of
the mass of the nuclear cluster, while in our neighbour M31, the black hole is ∼ 4 times more massive. For
a review, see Kormendy & Ho (2013) and the references therein.

– 41 –

Mcore = MBH +MC, the core-to-bulge mass ratio Mcore/MB1 also scales in agreement with
Kormendy & Ho (2013) for composite nuclei. Higher-resolution data will resolve the nucleus
and clarify whether the central rise of the rotation curve identiﬁed in ﬁgure 19 is due to
a black hole or a nuclear star cluster. In either case, the rise of the rotation curve within
r < 1(cid:48)(cid:48) reveals an embedded molecular gas disk or torus with a radius less than 50 pc. An
exponential disk and dark halo components are not included here because their contributions
are small at r < 500 pc. The disk would raise the rotation curve at larger radii, but due to
the presence of a galactic bar, detailed modeling of the bar potential would be required to
probe rotation beyond the 500-pc ring. The parameters of the model are shown in table 7.

In order to compare our mass estimate based on gas dynamics with the total mass
budget of the old stars in the central region, we used I-band (F814W ﬁlter on Hubble Space
Telescope) and Ks-band [ISAAC on Very Large Telescope; Galliano & Alloin (2008)] images
shown in ﬁgure 21. High-resolution I-band images have been useful in estimating black
hole masses in nearby galaxies (Davis et al. 2013; Onishi et al. 2015), whereas the Ks-band
image is a good choice because it is unaﬀected by dust extinction. The images were used
to derive the radial proﬁles of surface brightness, I(R) = L/D2 (L is the luminosity and D
is the physical size of the observed region), and estimate the total stellar surface density in
the central r < 250 pc, assuming a uniform mass-to-light ratio M (r)/L(r). To do this, we
normalized the peaks of the radial proﬁles to the peak of the surface density derived by using
gas dynamics. For the Plummer sphere model discussed above, the stellar surface density is
calculated as

ρ[r(z)] dz = 2

π(a2 + R2)2 ,

Σs(R) =
√

4π(a2 + z2 + R2)5/2 =

(7)
r2 − R2 is the axis along the line of sight, and R is the projected radius
where z =
in the plane of the sky. The results are given in table 7, and the total surface density
due to the bulge and nuclear bar, Σs = ΣB1 + ΣNB, is plotted in ﬁgure 22 along with the
normalized ﬂux proﬁles of the near-infrared images. The mass of the nuclear bar is calculated
as MNB = MB2 − MCND, where MCND = 1.4 × 108 M(cid:12) (table 5). To deal with the central
peak, we added a nuclear star cluster (mass MC and surface density ΣC calculated using
equation 7) to match the normalized ﬂux peak (assuming at this point that the near-infrared
emission is dominated by starlight rather than hot dust). The total surface density proﬁle
is then Σs = ΣB1 + ΣNB + ΣC. The obtained Σs is a good match for the observed surface
brightness, except in a region that appears like an arc or a spiral arm at r ∼ 200 pc marked
in ﬁgure 21, suggesting that the mass of the core can be dominated by a compact stellar
system. Furthermore, if the nucleus has undergone a starburst episode with a star formation
rate of SF R ∼ 1 M(cid:12) yr−1 over the past tSB ∼ 107 yr, as estimated by Krabbe et al. (1994),
it is reasonable to expect a star cluster at the galactic center with a mass comparable to
MC.

Alternatively, the central peak in the infrared images could be due to emission from dusty
ISM heated to high temperatures by a low-luminosity AGN. In that case, the peak would be
the product of a convolution of the AGN-dominated region with the point spread function
(PSF) of the telescope. In the simplest case, the AGN is a point source (delta function),
the PSF is a Gaussian, and the resulting convolution is equal to the PSF. Using the PSF of

– 45 –

the Ks-band image, it is possible to reproduce the central peak in surface brightness shown
in ﬁgure 22 (right). However, the convolution of the PSF with the surface brightness of the
compact cluster ΣC can also result in a function similar to the PSF.

4.2. Non-circular motions in the galactic disk

Gas kinematics can be further investigated with position-velocity diagrams (PVDs).
PVDs along the major (X) and minor (Y ) galactic axes can reveal azimuthal and radial
streaming motions, respectively (e.g., Aalto et al. 1999). Using the parameters derived above,
PVDs were plotted along the global kinematic major and minor axes at P Amaj = 324◦ and
P Amin = 54◦, respectively (ﬁgure 23). The width of the slits is equivalent to the FWHM of
the beam major axis.

The PVD along the major axis shown in ﬁgure 24a exhibits rotation that can be de-
composed into three components (modeled in section 4.1.4): (1) rigid-body rotation within
r < 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)5, (2) nearly ﬂat rotation curve within 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 < r < 6(cid:48)(cid:48), followed by (3) additional rise
in velocity. Inspection of ﬁgure 25 shows that the deviation (1) is less prominent beyond
|Y | = 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 from the nucleus suggesting that it is conﬁned to the central r (cid:46) 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)5, as expected
from a massive core in the CND.

4.2.1. Velocity gradient along the minor axis

Figure 24b shows a PVD plotted along the minor axis (X = 0(cid:48)(cid:48)) that reveals striking non-
circular motions in the central 1-kpc region: the “zig-zag” pattern as a signature of a velocity
gradient along the minor axis. As shown in the next section, the velocity oﬀsets at |Y | (cid:38) 8(cid:48)(cid:48)
correspond to a component dominated by the global bar dynamics. Non-circular motions
appear least important in the region 4(cid:48)(cid:48) < |Y | < 7(cid:48)(cid:48), where gas kinematics is dominated
by circular rotation of the disk (highest-intensity emission in ﬁgure 24b). Irregular motions
intensify again at |Y | < 4(cid:48)(cid:48), in the vicinity of nucleus.

The panels (c) and (d) of ﬁgure 24 show examples of ﬁtting with 3DBarolo: the red
contour is the best ﬁt obtained with a warp model superimposed on a the PVD diagram
made from the data cube. We note that the program created a good ﬁt for the major axis
(panel c). The situation is, however, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for the minor axis (panel d). The
ﬁt was successful only for the high-intensity emission that is near the systemic velocity (998
km s−1), i.e., for the near-circular motion components. Since 3DBarolo can handle warps in
circular orbits by searching for symmetric features in the data cube, we regard the non-ﬁtted
emission in ﬁgure 24d as non-circular motion. Speciﬁcally, we recognise two patterns: (1)

pattern, but the extreme velocities between vLSR = 870 and 950 km s−1 [corresponding to
|vLSR − vsys| = (48 − 128) km s−1] can be explained only as a large inﬂow in the disk or an
outﬂow oﬀ the disk. We show below that the outﬂow scenario is more likely (section 5).

4.2.2. Bar pattern speed and Lindblad resonances

To investigate non-circular motions in the galactic disk, we created a model of a disk
with pure circular rotation. The observed line-of-sight velocity vobs in cylindrical coordinates
(r, φ, z) is given by

vobs = vsys + vφ sin i cos φ + vr sin i sin φ + vz cos i,

(8)

where vφ is the rotational (azimuthal, φ component) velocity, vr radial velocity, vz vertical
velocity (perpendicular to the galactic plane negative toward the observer), and φ the position
angle measured with respect to the major galactic axis. The model velocity includes a
rotation curve vrot, and excludes radial and extraplanar motions (vr = vz = 0):

Subtracting the model velocity ﬁeld from the data, we get a residual image,

vmod = vsys + vrot sin i cos φ.

vres = (vφ − vrot) sin i cos φ + vr sin i sin φ + vz cos i,

(9)

(10)

that carries information about non-circular and extraplanar motions. Assuming that most
of the emission originates in the galactic plane (vz = 0), the residual image yields a relation
between azimuthal and radial velocities. Note that negative values of vφ correspond to
blueshifted velocities in images.

The parameters used to generate a model velocity ﬁeld for the central region are P A =
316◦ (mean value; section 4.1.3), i = 58◦, vsys = 998 km s−1, and vrot(r) derived from
numerical ﬁtting described in subsection 4.1.
In the case of a global model, we applied
P A = 324◦, i = 57◦, vsys = 964 km s−1, and a ﬂat rotation curve of v = 190 km s−1 beyond
13.(cid:48)(cid:48)6, consistent with the global rotation curve (Sofue et al. 1999). The position angle and
inclination are kept constant in the global model because in the central 1 kpc they vary with
radius less than about 10◦. The resulting residual velocity image is shown in ﬁgure 26. From
the residual image, it is clear that the velocity of molecular gas in the oﬀset ridges in the
bar region deviates largely from the rest of the disk.

– 53 –

The position angle of the bar is P Ab ≈ 335◦, hence only φ ≈ 11◦ with respect to
the galactic disk. Because of this, radial motion (vr sin i sin φ) can be ignored along the
bar in the residual velocity image given by equation 10. This is a favourable situation for
deriving the bar pattern speed Ωb using CO kinematics because equation 8 simpliﬁes to
vobs ≈ vsys + vφ sin i, where vφ ≈ rΩb becomes the rotational velocity of the bar and is
expected to linearly increase with r (e.g., Sakamoto et al. 2000; Kuno et al. 2000; Koda et
al. 2002; Koda & Sofue 2006; Hirota et al. 2014). This trend is clear from the PVD in ﬁgure
27 where the oﬀset ridges exhibit approximately linear behaviour. Measuring the velocities
at emission peaks along the ridge within the bar (1 kpc ≤ r ≤ 3 kpc) and ﬁtting with a
least-squares method, we derive a bar pattern speed of Ωb = 56 ± 11 km s−1 kpc−1.

Using the rotation curve derived in section 4.1.4, it is possible to calculate the angular ve-
locity Ω and investigate the dynamical resonances of stellar orbits in the galactic disk. The lo-

cations of Lindblad resonances are found from m(Ω−Ωb) = ±κ, where κ =(cid:112)rdΩ2/dr + 4Ω2
is the epicyclic frequency of stellar orbits calculated as κ (cid:39) (cid:112)2Ω(Ω + ∆v/∆r), and m is

the rotational symmetry parameter (equal to 2 for a bar or two-arm pattern). Figure 28
shows Ω, Ω ± κ/2, Ω − κ/4, and Ωb = 56 km s−1 kpc−1, where the rotation curve vrot was
adopted from ﬁgure 20 at r < 600 pc, and assumed constant, vrot = 190 km s−1, at r > 1.5
kpc (Sofue et al. 1999). If the disk rotation is ﬂat at vrot = (160−200) km s−1, corotation
occurs at rCR = vrot/Ωb (cid:39) (2.9 − 3.6) kpc, and rCR/ab (cid:39) (1.0 − 1.2), where ab is the length
of the semi-major axis of the bar (section 3.2.1). This result is consistent with theoretical
predictions for weak bars (e.g., Contopoulos 1980; Athanassoula 1992a; Binney & Tremaine
2008). A weak bar is “allowed” to exist only between the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR),
where Ωb = Ω − κ/2, and the corotation radius rCR, where Ω = Ωb (Binney & Tremaine
2008). From ﬁgure 28, the outer inner Lindblad resonance (oILR) appears at (0.9− 1.2) kpc.
Additional ILRs are located near 450 pc where Ω − κ/2 has a local minimum and intersects
with Ωb; they coincide with the 500-pc ring. The rotation curve includes the contribution
from a tentative massive black hole at the galaxy center. As a consequence, Ω− κ/2 sharply
rises within r < 50 pc [see, e.g., Combes et al. (2014) for NGC 1566]. There is also a res-
onance where Ω − κ/4 intersects with Ωb near r (cid:39) 2.2 kpc; close to this radius in the SE
ridge, we ﬁnd a GMA and Hii region (brieﬂy discussed in section 3.2.1; ﬁgure 9).

4.2.3. Residual velocities in the central 1 kpc

In the nuclear region, the residual velocities of molecular gas, derived in the previous
section and shown in ﬁgure 29, reveal the following patterns of non-circular motion (consis-
tent with the PVD discussed in section 4.2.1). First, there is conspicuous streaming motion

– 54 –

with magnitudes ∼ 50 km s−1 on the inner edge of the nuclear spiral arm (2(cid:48)(cid:48)−3(cid:48)(cid:48) south and
south-west of the center). The magnitude of the streaming motion is comparable but larger
than, e.g., in the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 by about a factor of two (Meidt et al. 2013).
Second, north-east of the center, there is a blueshifted component spatially correlated with
the extraplanar dust lane visible in the R-band (discussed in the next section). Finally, at
radii of r > 500 pc in the NE and SW, the residual velocities abruptly reach ∼ 100 km
s−1; these features are related to the velocity gradient near the ILR, also apparent from the
velocity ﬁeld and dispersion images presented in section 3.3. A comparison with ﬁgure 26
shows that the large residuals extend along the ridges in the bar region.

5. Molecular gas outﬂow

5.1. Morphology and kinematics

As shown in introduction, conspicuous dust lanes visible up to ∼ 3 kpc above the galactic
plane in optical images and the detection of Nai D in absorption and emission on opposite
sides of the disk indicate the presence of a neutral gas outﬂow at velocities up to vout ∼ 380
km s−1 (Phillips 1993). Furthermore, McCormick et al. (2013) found that the distribution
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) also extends into the halo to a similar distance,
conﬁrming the presence of a dusty wind. At the base of the outﬂow, recent integral-ﬁeld
observations revealed the presence of a cone of ionized gas (Sharp & Bland-Hawthorn 2010).
Since the central region of the galaxy is predominantly in molecular phase, one might expect
that CO-emitting gas is entrained in the superwind as observed in galaxies like M82 and
NGC 253 (e.g., Salak et al. 2013; Bolatto et al. 2013a). Is there any evidence of a CO outﬂow
in NGC 1808?

The optical image in ﬁgure 29b shows an extraplanar (polar) dust lane north-east of
the nucleus, at a similar position angle as the kpc-scale dust lanes in ﬁgure 30a and the hot
ionized cone revealed in the [Nii]/Hα ratio (Sharp & Bland-Hawthorn 2010). The location of
the outﬂow with respect to other galactic structures is marked in ﬁgure 30b. We also show
a comparison of an HST image with the CO (1-0) intensity distribution (high-sensitivity
image) in ﬁgure 30 (panels c and d): there are four kpc-scale dust lanes denoted by L1-L4,
all emerging from the central 1-kpc region. CO was not detected in the lanes L2-L4, except
at their inner ends [base of the outﬂow; panel (c)]. The molecular gas is coincident, however,
with an extraplanar dust lane L1 [panel (d)]. The L1 lane is blueshifted with respect to
the systemic velocity (vLSR ≈ 900 km s−1; see ﬁgure 31 and the blue wing in the spectrum
of the central 5(cid:48)(cid:48) region in ﬁgure 17) as would be expected from an outﬂow, though there
is no unambiguous redshifted counterpart on the opposite SW side [the asymmetry is also
apparent in the optical line in Phillips (1993) and Sharp & Bland-Hawthorn (2010)]. Figures
30 and 31 show that L1 is coincident with a spur of CO (1-0) emission that extends beyond
the 500-pc ring to around (α, δ)J2000 = (5h7m43.s2,−37◦30(cid:48)42(cid:48)(cid:48)). Enhanced velocity dispersion
(ﬁgure 15) and the velocity width as wide as 150 km s−1 along the minor axis north-east
of the nucleus (ﬁgures 24 and 32 below) also indicate the presence of extraplanar gas. It
is not clearly seen in the moment 1 image of ﬁgure 15 (left) because the velocity ﬁeld is
intensity-weighted and the extraplanar emission is spatially coincident with the underlying
circular-rotation in the disk that dominates the overall CO (1-0) emission. Assuming a
nuclear outﬂow perpendicular to the galactic plane, the average deprojected outﬂow velocity
becomes (equation 8)

– 60 –

(cid:39) 180 km s−1,

vz =

(11)
where i = 57◦, vobs = 900 km s−1, and vsys = 998 km s−1 (section 4.1). Note that if
this gas were in the galactic plane, the observed velocity would yield an inﬂow of vr =
|vobs − vsys|/ sin i (cid:39) 117 km s−1 inside the r < 500 pc disk, which is comparable to the
rotational velocity. The derived outﬂow velocity is consistent with typical values found in
superwinds in galaxies like M82 and NGC 253 [100-200 km s−1; e.g., Nakai et al. (1987);
Walter et al. (2002); Salak et al. (2013); Bolatto et al. (2013a)]. Also, the detection of
blueshifted emission NE from the center excludes the possibility of an extraplanar gas inﬂow.
The opening angle of the outﬂow is uncertain, but the orientation of the dust lanes at the
base of the outﬂow appears nearly perpendicular to the galactic major axis on optical images.
The L4 lane reconnects with the galactic disk at a radius of r ∼ 3 kpc, indicating the gas
motion as a fountain - the ejected ISM material falling back onto the galaxy [see Phillips
(1993)]. The multitude of dust lanes is interesting because it suggests that extraplanar gas
and dust may be conﬁned to narrow regions as “ﬁlaments” in addition to the projected walls
of a cylindric outﬂow as seen in, e.g., M82 (Nakai et al. 1987; Salak et al. 2013; Leroy et al.
2015).

5.2. Mass and kinetic energy

Infrared and radio observations show that the nucleus is ongoing a starburst episode
with a star formation rate of SF Rcore ∼ (0.5−1) M(cid:12) yr−1 (Krabbe et al. 1994; Kotilainen et
al. 1996) (assuming that the energy output in the core is dominated by supernova explosions
rather than AGN). As a consequence, the region is shocked by supernovae that generate
non-thermal radiation and an ionization cone discussed above. Following Condon & Yin
(1990), Krabbe et al. (1994) estimated the supernova rate in the nucleus using the 5-GHz
continuum as RSN = 0.024 yr−1. The released energy during a starburst episode [tSB (cid:38) 1×107
yr; Krabbe et al. (1994) and Kotilainen et al. (1996)] is then3

ESN ∼ RSNE0tSB ∼ 2 × 1056 erg,

(12)

where E0 = 1051 erg is the energy released by a single type-II supernova explosion. It is
of importance to compare this energy with the kinetic energy of the molecular gas outﬂow.
Below, we consider the outﬂow mass estimates based on two limiting cases.

5.2.1. Optically thick emission

Inspecting the channel maps (e.g., ﬁgure 31), we ﬁnd that the outﬂow contribution to the
CO (1-0) ﬂux is no more than about 10% in the central 1 kpc. If the mass of the molecular gas
in the outﬂow is Mout ∼ 0.1Mmol ∼ 6 × 107 M(cid:12), where Mmol is the total molecular gas mass
in the central region (r < 15(cid:48)(cid:48); table 5), and vz = 180 km s−1, the kinetic energy becomes
Eout (cid:39) Moutv2
z /2 ∼ 2 × 1055 erg. This is an upper limit because the CO (1-0) emission
is assumed optically thick (the conversion factor XCO = 0.8 × 1020 cm−2(K km s−1)−1 was
applied). Therefore, the derived energy released by supernova explosions is an order of
magnitude higher than the upper limit of the molecular gas kinetic energy inferred from the
measured CO (1-0) ﬂuxes and velocities in the central region.

5.2.2. Optically thin emission

In the case of optically thin CO (1-0) emission, the total number of H2 molecules can

be calculated as

3Krabbe et al. (1994) estimated that the starburst has been going on for (cid:38) 5 × 107 yr. We adopt a lower

limit based on the mass of the nuclear cluster estimated in section 4.1.

where θ is the diameter of the region. For the adopted CO (1-0) ﬂux in the outﬂow in
the central region r < 15(cid:48)(cid:48), we get ICO = 122.4 Jy km s−1 = 12.6 K km s−1. Assuming
an abundance ratio of f = 104, the total mass within r < R = 15(cid:48)(cid:48) becomes Mout =
1.41 × 2mHNH2 ∼ 8 × 106 M(cid:12), where mH is the hydrogen atom mass and the factor 1.41
accounts for He and other elements. The kinetic energy of the nuclear outﬂow is then only
Eout ∼ 1054 erg.

5.3. Dynamical evolution

The molecular gas outﬂow traced by CO (spur in ﬁgure 29) is evident up to a deprojected
height of z ∼ 1 kpc. Assuming spherical symmetry, the lower limit of the escape velocity at

this radius from the center is given by vesc =(cid:112)2|Φ|, where Φ = −GM/z is the gravitational

potential (simpliﬁed as a point source). The total mass within this region is M (z < 1 kpc) ∼
1×1010 M(cid:12), hence vesc ∼ 300 km s−1. The escape velocity is comparable but somewhat larger
than the average outﬂow velocity, vout (cid:46) vesc, indicating that the molecular gas outﬂow may
be trapped in the potential well of the galaxy. Note that Phillips (1993) found a maximum
outﬂow velocity of ∼ 380 km s−1; the fastest gas clouds may be able to escape. For the

– 66 –

adopted distance of z = 1 kpc and velocity vout = 180 km s−1, the dynamical age of the
outﬂow is tout ∼ z/vout ∼ 5 × 106 yr, consistent with the estimate by Phillips (1993) based
on Nai D spectra. This is shorter than the nuclear star-forming activity (tSB (cid:38) 1 × 107 yr):
the outﬂow is resupplied via supernova explosions during the starburst episodes.

If the masses and timescales are correct, the mass outﬂow rate from the central region
of NGC 1808 is ˙Mout ∼ Mout/tout ∼ (1−10) M(cid:12) yr−1, comparable to the total star formation
rate in the starburst 500-pc region [SF R ∼ 5 M(cid:12) yr−1 in all “hot spots” combined; (Krabbe
et al. 1994)], yielding ˙Mout/SF R ∼ 0.2 for the optically thin case. Note that, in spite
of violent star formation feedback, evidenced by numerous supernova remnants and polar
dust lanes, the nucleus and the r < 500 pc disk (including the ring) are very abundant in
molecular gas. In order to replenish the gas reservoir, a mass inﬂow rate comparable to ˙Mout
is required. This can be expected from the double bar and spiral arms. By comparison, the
mass outﬂow rate in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 is ˙Mout ∼ (3−9) M(cid:12) yr−1 and the
ratio ˙Mout/SF R ∼ 3 (Bolatto et al. 2013a). Similarly, the ratio in M82 is
˙Mout/SF R ∼ 1
(Walter et al. 2002; Salak et al. 2013): the quenching of star formation in NGC 1808 seems
less eﬃcient than in NGC 253 and M82.

It should be noted, however, that we cannot exclude the possibility that the outﬂow is
too extended and diﬀuse to be sampled with the 12-m array without short-spacing correction,
so the derivation of the outﬂow mass is largely uncertain. Combining 12-m array data with
ACA (Atacama Compact Array) and total power data will clarify the spatial extent and
energetics of the molecular gas outﬂow.

On the other hand, deep HST images of Hα (e.g., ﬁgure 8) show little sign of extraplanar
ionized gas in polar direction as far as the kpc-scale dust lanes. Could the dust lanes further
out in the halo be associated with atom-dominated gas, traced with Hi and possibly [Ci]
or [Cii]? This question is related to the nature of superwinds in galaxies: what is their
dominant ISM phase and what mechanisms govern phase transitions as the wind evolves?

6. Star formation and disk stability in the central 1 kpc

In section 3.1 we presented 2.8-mm continuum data that reveal the presence of circum-
nuclear compact sources dominated by thermal emission. Note that the sources C1, C2, and
C3 (ﬁgure 4 and table 4) are located along the nuclear spiral arm on the inside of the 500-pc
ring detected in CO (1-0) (ﬁgure 33). Sources C1, C3, and C4 are spatially correlated with
the mid-infrared sources denoted by M3, M2, M6-M8 and interpreted as young star clusters
and Hii regions embedded in dusty clouds (Galliano & Alloin 2008). The comparison of

– 67 –

the continuum and CO distributions (ﬁgure 33) also reveals that, apart from the SE region,
there is no detected 2.8-mm continuum emission associated with the molecular 500-pc ring;
star-forming activity and its feedback are more prominent in the inner r < 400 pc disk [see
also, e.g., Saikia et al. (1990) for the distribution of supernova remnants that are also within
the inner disk].

One of the long-standing problems in galactic dynamics is to understand the mechanism
of transport of molecular gas from the nuclear ring near the inner Lindblad resonances,
such as the 500-pc ring in NGC 1808, to the very center of the galaxy (< 1 pc). The
main processes involved are nuclear bars and spiral arms. Both structures generate non-
axisymmetric gravitational potential that exerts torque on the outer region (e.g., Schwarz
1984; Buta & Combes 1996; Combes et al. 2014). Angular momentum is transferred outward,
while the material decays to lower orbits. In NGC 1808, the presence of a nuclear bar and
a spiral arm is indicative of gas inﬂow from the 500-pc ring. In order to clarify its relation
with star formation unveiled with radio continuum and infrared observations, we investigated
the gravitational stability of the disk region between the CND and the ring. The stability
criterion can be expressed as a Q parameter for ﬂuids (Safronov 1960; Toomre 1964),

Qgas ≡ αvsκ
πGΣgas

,

(16)

where α is a constant (assumed equal to unity here), vs is the speed of sound related to
the velocity dispersion of the ISM gas, σmol. The stability increases with velocity dispersion
and epicyclic frequency κ (related to diﬀerential rotation), and decreases with gas surface
density. When Qgas (cid:46) 1, the gaseous disk is unstable and likely to increase star forming
activity. The resulting Qgas, calculated with vs = σmol, is shown in ﬁgure 34; the uncertainty
of the derived values is high due to the variation in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor XCO,
velocity dispersion, surface density, and rotation curve. Nevertheless, the result shows that
the disk stability is somewhat low (although Qgas (cid:38) 1) between 100 and 300 pc where the
rotation curve exhibits a gentle slope, qualitatively consistent with the observational results
above. The sudden drop beyond r > 500 pc (beyond the ring) should be taken with reserve
as the signal-to-noise ratio is low in that region.

This result is diﬀerent from the one found, e.g., in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, where
the instability is highest in the resonant ring (Qgas (cid:46) 1 and active star formation), while the
gaseous disk is gradually more stable toward the galactic center (Fathi et al. 2015). The high
Qgas in the central 500 pc of NGC 1808 is comparable to the results obtained for a sample of
nearby spiral galaxies including NGC 6946 (Romeo & Falstad 2013; Romeo & Fathi 2015).
Contrary to the inner r < 400 pc disk, star formation activity in NGC 1808 appears less
prominent outside the resonant 500-pc ring due to a high velocity gradient imposed by bar

7. Summary

We have presented the ﬁrst high-resolution ALMA observations of CO (1-0) and 2.8
mm continuum in the barred starburst galaxy NGC 1808. Below is a summary of the main
ﬁndings.

1. Continuum emission. Radio continuum at 2.8 mm (synthesized over four bands at 101,
103, 113, and 115 GHz) was detected at the nucleus and circumnuclear regions within
r < 400 pc. The spectral index (α) image conﬁrms that the nucleus is dominated by
non-thermal (synchrotron) emission with α (cid:39) −1.

2. Molecular gas distribution. High-resolution CO (1-0) images revealed four distinct
components of molecular gas: (1) compact circumnuclear disk (CND) within r < 200
pc, (2) 500-pc ring, (3) gas-rich galactic bar with semi-major axis ab (cid:39) 3 kpc, and (4)
global (kpc-scale) and nuclear (r < 400 pc) spiral structure. In the inner r < 400 pc
disk, molecular gas is distributed in a spiral pattern.

3. Molecular gas kinematics. Basic geometric and kinematic parameters (position angle,
inclination, rotation curve, and velocity dispersion) were derived for the central 1 kpc
region using the 3DBarolo code. Two systemic velocities were found (998 km s−1 for
the CND and 964 km s−1 for the 500-pc ring), indicating a kinematic oﬀset. Streaming
motion with magnitude ∼ 50 km s−1 is revealed on the inner side of a nuclear spiral
arm. On a large scale, molecular gas clouds exhibit conspicuous non-circular motions
dominated by the primary bar, with a velocity gradient (shear) of vsh (cid:39) (0.2−1) km
s−1 pc−1 across the molecular gas ridges on the leading side of the bar.

4. Rotation curve decomposition and dynamical mass. The rotation curve derived from the
CO (1-0) emission was deconvolved into a stellar bulge (mass MB1 ∼ 1.25×1010 M(cid:12)), a
major core that comprises a nuclear bar and molecular medium (MB2 ∼ 7.2× 108 M(cid:12)),
and an unresolved minor core, possibly a nuclear star cluster or black hole with mass
Mcore ∼ 1 × 107 M(cid:12) surrounded by an embedded molecular gas disk with a radius
r < 50 pc.

5. Bar dynamics and orbital resonances. The bar pattern speed of the large-scale bar was
derived as Ωb = 56 ± 11 km s−1 kpc−1 from the position-velocity diagram assuming a
cloud-orbit model. For a ﬂat rotation curve of 190 km s−1 at r > 1.5 kpc, the pattern
speed yields a corotation radius of rCR (cid:39) 3.4 kpc and the ratio rCR/ab (cid:39) 1.1, consistent
with theoretical predictions for weak bars. An inner Lindblad resonance is located at
∼ 500 pc, coincident with the location of the molecular gas ring.

– 72 –

6. Molecular gas outﬂow. We presented evidence of a molecular gas outﬂow from the
nuclear starburst region (r < 250 pc). The outﬂow has a maximum velocity of vout ∼
180 km s−1 and a total kinetic energy two orders of magnitude smaller than the energy
released by supernova explosions in the nucleus.

7. Gas disk stability and star formation. In the region 200 pc < r < 400 pc, the stability
parameter of the gas disk, Qgas, is lower than average, allowing enhanced star formation
activity, consistent with observations of circumnuclear “hot spots”.

tration.

A. HCN (4-3) observations with ASTE

Single-dish observations with Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE)4
were conducted in 2014 September and October with single pointing toward the galactic
center (table 8). The frontend receiver CATS 345 was tuned to the HCN (J = 4 → 3) line at
the rest frequency of 354.505473 GHz in the upper side band. The signal was down-converted
to an intermediate frequency and resolved with an XF-type autocorrelation spectrometer
with a total bandwidth of 512 MHz (443 km s−1) and ﬁne spectral resolution of 0.5 MHz.

4The ASTE telescope is operated by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ).

– 73 –

The bandwidth was wide enough to cover the velocity range of the Hi and CO (3-2) lines
(Koribalski et al. 1993; Salak et al. 2014), hence we assumed that the HCN (4-3) line does not
exhibit a wider proﬁle. Intensity calibration was performed by the standard chopper wheel
method that yielded the antenna temperature T ∗
A corrected for atmospheric and ohmic losses
(Ulich & Haas 1976). Each time the receiver was tuned, an intensity calibrator (Orion KL)
was observed to measure a reference spectrum at the same frequency. An appropriate scaling
factor was then applied to correct for intensity ﬂuctuations and to convert T ∗
A to the main
beam temperature, Tmb ≡ T ∗
A/ηmb, where ηmb is the main beam eﬃciency. The derived
scaling factor of 1.6 yielded ηmb (cid:39) 0.6, consistent with the telescope data provided online.
Telescope pointing was checked after every observing run of about one hour and the relative
oﬀset was typically < 3(cid:48)(cid:48).

Data reduction was done by using the NEWSTAR tool developed by Nobeyama Ra-
dio Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Raw data were con-
verted to spectra, ﬂagged, baseline-subtracted (ﬁrst-order polynomial), and smoothed to
a velocity resolution of 5.5 km s−1. The basic properties of the line are given in ta-

A.1. HCN (4-3) emission in the galactic nucleus

In ﬁgure 35 we show the spectrum of HCN (4-3) toward the galactic center at (α, δ)J2000.0 =
(5h7m42.s06,−37◦30(cid:48)44.(cid:48)(cid:48)42) measured using ASTE whose beam size was FHWM = 22(cid:48)(cid:48) (1.1
kpc). The proﬁle is notably diﬀerent from the triple peak seen in CO (1-0) [as well as in
CO (3-2) and 13CO (3-2); Salak et al. (2014)] in the inner 1 kpc and much more similar
to the CO proﬁle within the central r < 250 pc (ﬁgure 17). The velocity of 998 km s−1 at
the emission peak calculated with Gaussian ﬁtting (table 9) also resembles the one derived
from CO at the center. This result is not surprising if HCN (4-3) emission originates almost
entirely in the CND and much less in the 500-pc ring. Given the expected eﬀective critical
density5 of the order of ncr > 104 cm−3 for HCN (4-3) at any temperature between 10 and
a few hundred K (e.g., Shirley 2015), the line is known to trace extremely dense molecular
