ABSTRACT
Gravity is believed to be important on multiple physical scales in molecular clouds. However,
quantitative constraints on gravity are still lacking. We derive an analytical formula which
provides estimates on multi-scale gravitational energy distribution using the observed surface
density PDF. Our analytical formalism also enables one to convert the observed column den-
sity PDF into an estimated volume density PDF, and to obtain average radial proﬁle ρ(r). For
a region with Ncol ∼ N−γN, the gravitational energy spectra is Ep(k) ∼ k−4(1−1/γN). We apply
the formula to observations of molecular clouds, and ﬁnd that a scaling index of −2 of the
surface density PDF implies that ρ ∼ r−2 and Ep(k) ∼ k−2. This indicates that gravity can act
eﬀectively against turbulence over a multitude of physical scales. This is the critical scaling
index which divides molecular clouds into two categories: clouds like Orion and Ophiuchus
have shallower power laws, and the amount of gravitational energy is too large for turbulence
to be eﬀective inside the cloud. Because of the dominates of gravity, we call this type of cloud
g-type clouds. On the other hand, clouds like the California molecular cloud and the Pipe
nebula have steeper power laws, and turbulence can overcome gravity if it can cascade eﬀec-
tively from the large scale. We call this type of cloud t-type clouds. The analytical formula
can be used to determine if gravity is dominating cloud evolution when the column density
probability distribution function (PDF) can be reliably determined.

INTRODUCTION

The interplay between turbulence and gravity plays determining
roles in the dynamics of astrophysical ﬂuids, and in particular
molecular clouds (Dobbs et al. 2014, and references therein). Tur-
bulence is a self-similar process. It is believed that it can eﬀectively
transport energy from the large scale to smaller scales, and provide
necessary support to stop matter from collapsing too rapidly (Mac
Low & Klessen 2004). The eﬀect of turbulence in star formation is
subject to intensive investigations during the past decade.

Gravity, being the only long-range and attractive force, de-
termines the dynamics of the majority of astrophysical systems.
Molecular clouds exhibit structures on a multitude of physical

scales – from at
(Williams et al. 2000). Because gravity is scale-free, it can be im-
portant on all these physical scales. Previously, the importance of
gravity has been quantiﬁed on various scales using the virial param-
eter (Bertoldi & McKee 1992). The importance of gravity on mul-

tiple physical scales has also been observationally demonstrated
(Goodman et al. 2009; Li et al. 2015b). One limitation of the virial
parameter is that one needs to specify a scale on which it can be
evaluated. Thus it is diﬃcult to obtain a multi-scale picture of grav-
ity based on the virial parameter alone. Besides, the virial parame-
ter is not additive. Thus it is not useful for evaluating the importance
of gravity on bulk molecular gas.

A better representation of the importance of gravity is the
gravitational energy. Compared to the virial parameter, energy is
additive. One can separate the total gravitational energy of a molec-
ular cloud into contributions from diﬀerent parts and from diﬀerent
physical scales. This provides a multi-scale picture of gravity in
molecular clouds – an important piece of information that is still
missing. This task is now feasible as observations can reliably trace
the gas from 102 parsec down to sub-parsec scales.

The structure of a molecular cloud can be interpreted by the
surface density PDFs (PDF is the probability distribution function).
It is a measure of the distribution of the observed surface density
structure of a molecular cloud. Observationally, the PDFs are found
to exhibit power-law forms PNcol ∼ N

least for the parts with high surface densities (Kainulainen et al.
2009). This is usually interpreted as the system being strongly self-
gravitating, perhaps also inﬂuenced by rotation and magnetic ﬁeld
(Kritsuk et al. 2011; Girichidis et al. 2014; Kainulainen et al. 2009).
One importance piece of information that one can extract from the
observed surface density PDF is to constrain how the gravitational
energy of a molecular cloud is distributed across diﬀerent physical
scales. This is the major focus of this work.

We present observational constraints on the multi-scale im-
portance of gravity by inferring it from the observed surface den-
sity PDF of a molecular cloud. The formalism is based on a simple
fact, that the high-density parts of the gas tend to reside in envelops
of gas of relatively lower densities. This insight enables us to con-
struct a nested shell model for the dense parts of molecular clouds.
The model captures the cloud structure seen in observations and
yet at the same time enables us to evaluate the contribution to the
gravitational energy from various physical scales with an analytical
approach. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we de-
scribe our model, and derive an analytical formula to compute the
multi-scale gravitational energy distribution (called gravitational
energy spectrum in this work) from the observed surface density
PDF. The formulas to convert the observed column density PDF
into volume density PDF, averaged radial proﬁle and gravitational
energy spectra are summarized in Sec. 2.4. Then these formulas are
applied to observations to provide constraints (Sec. 3). In Sec. 4 we
conclude.

2 MULTI-SCALE GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY
2.1 Observational picture

A surface density PDF is a statistical probability distribution of the
observed surface densities of a molecular cloud. At high surface
densities, molecular clouds exhibit power-law PDFs. It has been
demonstrated that one can “unfold” the observed surface density
distribution into the intrinsic density PDF (ρ-PDF, (Kainulainen
et al. 2014)), either with a volume density modeling technique
(Kainulainen et al. 2014) or with an analytical formula (Girichidis
et al. 2014).

Suppose that above a critical surface density of Ncol, min, a

molecular cloud has an observed surface density distribution of

where Ncol is the observed surface density and γN ≈ 2. The ρ-PDF

where ρ0 ≈ N0/L and L is the size of the region. As a crude
plane, the region is composed of M ≈ N × N = (L/dx)2 pixels
which implies PN0 ≈ L2, and in 3D, the region is composed of
M(cid:48) ≈ N × N × N = (L/dx)3 pixels, which implies Pρ0 ≈ L3.
Here, PN0 and Pρ0 have dimensions of area and volume, respec-
tively. As has been demonstrated in Girichidis et al. (2014); Kritsuk
et al. (2013), this empirical relation is reasonably accurate when
applied to numerical simulations where a multitude of structures
are present. Similar approaches have also been taken by Fischera
(2014).

2.2 The shell model

We assume a multi-scale spherical symmetric nested model for
molecular clouds where gas with high densities stays inside regions
of lower densities. We consider a simpliﬁed model where the en-
tire star-forming region can be approximated as one such structure.
We call this a “shell model”. The basic idea of this simpliﬁcation is
sketched in Fig. 1.

We assume that above a critical density ρcrit, a star-forming

region obeys

where γρ ≈ 1.5. Pρ0 ≈ L3 where L is the size of the region, and
ρ0 ≈ N0/L. Here, the probability is measured in terms of surface
area, and Pρ0 has a unit of L3 where L is the size. The amount of
mass dM(ρ) contained in a shell of mass with (ρ, ρ + dρ) is

integration to converge (which correspond to γN > 1). This is in
general satisﬁed for the observed star-forming regions.

construct a shell model where the density distribution satisﬁes e.g. ρ(r) ∼ r2 where r is the radius. This is an approximation to the real density structure of
the region. Turbulence can be driven from the outer shell and would cascades inwards. The image of NGC1333 is produced from the 13CO(1-0) data from the

Here we brieﬂy explain the meaning of the formula for the
gravitational energy spectrum (Eq. 13). The gravitational energy
spectrum is the distribution of the total gravitational energy of the
cloud at diﬀerent wavenumbers k where k is related to the physical
scale by k = 2π/l. A large k represents the gravitational energy at
small scales, contributed by gas that resides in the inner parts of
the region. A small k represents the gravitational energy at large
scales, contributed by gas at the outer envelopes. A steeper slope of
Ep(k) means gravitational energy is concentrated at larger scales,
and a shallower slope means gravitational energy is concentrated at
smaller scales. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.

servers to interpreted the observed surface density PDF with physi-
cally meaningful models. For this purpose, we collected all the use-
ful formulas below. Suppose we have a region of size L, and this
region has a minimum surface density N0. In this region, the high
surface density part stays inside envelopes of low surface densities
(like the case of NGC1333 shown in Fig. 1), and its N-PDF can be
written as

in the estimate of gravitational energy. Here we brieﬂy discuss this
accuracy issue.

We consider a thought experiment where we artiﬁcially split
an object into N completely separated sub-clumps and keep the
density distribution unchanged. The gravitational energy of an ob-
ject of mass M and size r0 is

GM2
r0

,

E0 = η
(19)
where η ∼ 1 and is dependent on the underlying geometry of the
gas. After the artiﬁcial fragmentation, this object is divided into N
smaller objects of equal mass of M/N and equal radius r0/N1/3. The
total gravitational energy of the artiﬁcially fragmented system is

E1 = η

G(M/N)2 × N

r/N1/3

= E0N−2/3 .

(20)

Thus this artiﬁcial fragmentation process will decrease the gravita-
tional binding energy by a factor of N−2/3 where N is the number
of subregions.

The energy diﬀerence created by this artiﬁcial splitting (frag-
mentation) process can be considered as a safe upper limit of the
error of the estimation in reality. This is because in our calcula-
tions, after the artiﬁcial fragmentation experiment, the clumps are

assumed to be gravitationally non-interacting. But in reality they
are gravitationally interacting. This will decrease the energy diﬀer-
ence between E0 and E1. Practically speaking, in many cases, we
are interested in the general trend, e.g. how the gravitational energy
evolves with scale. In these cases, the diﬀerence is insigniﬁcant as
long as the number of subregions does not change signiﬁcantly with
increasing surface density.

Typically (see Fig. 3), for compact star forming regions like
NGC1333 in the Perseus molecular cloud, the high density parts
always stay inside nested envelopes of lower densities. Therefore
N ≈ 1 provides a fairly good description of the geometrical struc-
ture of such regions. For the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, fragmen-
tation occurs and N ≈ 3. However, since the three regions are close
to each other, and they are still gravitationally interacting, the inac-
curacy of the gravitational energy estimate is not as signiﬁcant as
Eq. 20 with N ≈ 3 suggests. Ideally, if the data are available, one
could separate a star formation region (e.g. the Perseus molecu-
lar cloud) into subregions (e.g. NGC1333) and evaluate the surface
density PDF inside these regions. After the separation, the regions
have structures that can better be approximated by the nested shell
model. Clouds like the Polaris molecular cloud are composed of
many sub-regions. Here, one can still separate the cloud into indi-
vidual subregions and evaluate the gravitational energy spectra of

Eq. 13 to derive the gravitational energy spectrum of the cloud as a
whole. In this case, it is implicitly assumed that these regions have
somewhat similar shapes.

The geometry of star-forming regions are not symmetric. This
might also be a contributing factor to the inaccuracy of the model.
However, a detailed calculation suggests that this eﬀect is not sig-
niﬁcant. The simplest way to quantify this is to consider the impact
of aspect ratio on the estimated gravitational energy. An aspect ratio
of ∼ 10 only changes the gravitational binding energy by a factor
of ∼ 1.5 (see Appendix A for details). Thus our Equation 12 should
be a good approximation of the energy spectrum in spite of all the
above-mentioned compilations.

INTERPLAY BETWEEN TURBULENCE AND
GRAVITY

3.1 Observational results

It has been demonstrated observationally that molecular clouds ex-
hibit power-law PDFs. Lombardi et al. (2015) studied the surface
density distribution of 8 nearby molecular clouds, and ﬁnd thet they
all exhibit power-law column density distributions at Av (cid:38) 0.3.
However diﬀerent regions have diﬀerent scaling indices. We use
these scaling indices to determine the gravitational energy spectra
of the clouds.

3.2 Two regimes of cloud evolution

It is found that turbulence in molecular clouds is supersonic. The
power spectrum of the turbulence is believed to be close to that of
Burgers turbulence, which is Ek ∼ k−2 (Federrath 2013). This is the
maximum amount of energy one would expect to be transferred to
smaller scales. On the largest scale, molecular clouds are close to be
gravitational bound (Roman-Duval et al. 2010; Heyer et al. 2009),
and the amount of turbulence energy is comparable to the gravita-
tional binding energy. Many of the clumps in the clouds are also in
virial equilibrium (Wienen et al. 2012). It is worth noting that the
estimate of the virial parameter might be inaccurate, and a change
in the choice of the boundaries of the regions often leads to changes
in the estimated virial parameters. Li et al. (2015b) have demon-
strated that by carefully choosing the boundaries of the regions, the
cloud is much more gravitationally bound than previously thought.
It is also still not fully clear what is driving turbulence.

Lombardi et al. (2015) found that molecular clouds exhibit
power-law surface density PDFs at Av (cid:38) 0.3. The scaling exponents
are close to -2. Using Equation 13, this corresponds to a gravita-
tional energy spectrum of Ep ∼ k−2, which coincides exactly with
the energy spectrum of Burgers turbulence. In this case, if turbu-
lence can cascade eﬀectively, the cloud should be in a critical state
where the turbulence and gravitational energy are comparable on
multiple scales (from a few parsec to subparsec). A steeper gravita-
tional energy spectrum means that there is less gravitational energy
than turbulent energy; and a shallower spectrum implies the domi-
nance of gravitational energy.

In Fig. 4 we present the derived gravitational energy spectra
using the results from Table 1 of Lombardi et al. (2015). The re-
sults are valid from Av ≈ 0.3 to Av (cid:46) 10. Then the gravitational
energy spectra are evaluated using Eq. 13 where the surface density
PDF has been ﬁrst converted into volume density PDF according to
Girichidis et al. (2014).

observed surface density PDF (P(Ncol) ∼ N

surface density). γρ is the scaling exponent of the theoretically-derived vol-
ume density PDF (P(ρ) ∼ ρ−γρ ). γEp is the scaling exponent of the gravita-
tional energy spectra (Ep(k) ∼ k−γEp ). Ep(k) ∼ k−2 is the theoretical bound-
ary between gravity-dominated clouds and turbulence-dominated clouds.
Clouds above the horizontal dashed line are gravity-dominated and clouds
below the horizontal dashed line are turbulence-dominated.

Molecular clouds like Perseus and Ophiuchus have shallow
surface density PDF (where the scaling exponent is larger than -
2). This corresponds to gravitational energy spectra that are rela-
tively ﬂat compared to the case of Burgers turbulence. If the clouds
are gravitational bound on the large scale l0, it is inevitable that at
any smaller scale (l < l0, typically parsec scale), gravitational en-
ergy will dominate turbulent energy. Thus these regions are either
undergoing gravitational collapse (e.g. Burkert & Hartmann 2004;
Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2011; Hoyle 1953; Elmegreen 1993), or
are supported by e.g. magnetic ﬁelds. Indeed, all these clouds are
actively forming stars. The Orion B molecular cloud has a steeper
gravitational energy spectrum (γEp
= 2) as compared to Orion A
= 1.89), which might explain why star formation in Orion B is
(γEp
∼ 3 times less eﬃcient as compared to Orion A (Megeath et al.
2016). It is interacting with winds from a collection of massive
stars and is probably close to disruption (Bally 2008). Generally
speaking, for the category of clouds with γE < 2, gravity tends to
dominate over turbulence at smaller scales, we name this type as
gravity-dominated type (g-type).
At the lower part of Fig. 4, the clouds have gravitational en-
ergy spectra that are steeper than k−2. In these cases, if turbulence
can cascade eﬀectively onto the smaller scales, it can support the
cloud against gravitational collapse and dominates over gravita-
tional forces. However, as the energy cascade of supersonic tur-
bulence under the inﬂuence of gravity is still not well understood
yet, we are refrained from drawing a ﬁrm conclusion. The clouds
in this regime can for example be supported magnetically. We call
this type of cloud turbulence-dominated type (t-type). It should also
be noted that a cloud might belong to the marginal type, e.g. the
Orion B molecular cloud Ep ∼ k−2, and is at the boundary between
turbulence-dominated and gravity-dominated types .

This distinction draws further supports from observational
studies of their star-formation activities. For t-type clouds, apart
from the Taurus molecular cloud which has a power law index of
the gravitational energy spectrum of ∼ −2.26, none of these clouds
are considered as active in star formation. The Taurus molecu-
lar cloud is an interesting marginal case. It is considered as star-
forming. The star formation rate in Taurus is similar to that of
the Ophiuchus molecular cloud (Lada et al. 2012). However the
star formation is extremely distributed as compared to the clustered
fashion in Ophiuchus. Perhaps the lack of small-scale gravitational
energy is directly related to the lack of clustered star formation in

is contributed by the outer shells. The critical energy spectrum of Burgers turbulence E(k) ∼ k−2 is indicated by the thick black line. The gravitational energy
spectrum of the Orion B cloud have E(k) ∼ k−2 and coincides with that of Burgers turbulence. Above the critical energy spectrum, the gravitational energy
exceeds the inferred turbulence energy and gravitational collapse dominats. Below it, gravity can be balanced by turbulence. The normalization of the y-axis
is arbitrary.

ﬁlaments, where gravity can probably trigger collapse in a non-
uniform fashion (Burkert & Hartmann 2004) that is not well cap-
tured by our method. It has also been suggested that Taurus molec-
ular cloud is supported by feedback (Li et al. 2015a) and magnetic
ﬁelds (Heyer et al. 2008), consistent with our t-type classiﬁcation.
Note also that in the t-type clouds, turbulence can provide sup-
port against gravity. However, this does not necessarily mean that
the regions are unbound. Since we only consider the bulk amount of
gravitational energy, even if one has demonstrated that Eturb > Ep,
some sub-regions can still be gravitational bound. But to compen-
sate this, other regions need to be unbound in order to accommodate
this excess of kinetic energy.

Overall, the molecular clouds as studied in Lombardi et al.
(2015) and this work have energy spectra that scatter around the
critical value of γE = 2 for which turbulence and gravity can bal-
ance each other. This perhaps suggests that in general, there ex-
ists multi-scale equipartition between gravity and turbulence. In
summary, assuming that all these clouds are roughly gravitational
bound on the cloud scale (l0), their gravitational energy per mass
can diﬀer by more than one order or magnitude on smaller scales
(≈ 0.1 l0). This signiﬁcant diﬀerence indicates that molecular
clouds can belong to two separate categories (or two states (Collins
et al. 2012)): in the g-type clouds, gravity can dominate over tur-
bulence and in the other; and in the t-type clouds, turbulence could
provide support against gravity.

4 CONCLUSIONS & DISCUSSIONS

In this work, by approximating the observed star-forming regions
as collections of spherically symmetric nested shells where gas of
high densities resides in envelops of lower densities, we derive an
analytical formula for the gravitational energy spectrum. If, above
a minimum surface density Nmin, a cloud has a density PDF of the
form N = N0 N
, it can be approximated as a set of nested shells
that are described by :

where ρ0 ≈ N0/L, L is the size of the region. The wavenumber
k is k = 2π/l where l is the length scale. For a typical molecular
cloud with γN ≈ 2, it satisﬁes ρ ∼ r−2, which implies a gravitational
energy spectrum of Ep(k) ∼ k−2.

Eq. 21 enables us to evaluate the distribution of gravitational
energy over multitude scales. This can be compared with the ex-
pected kinetic energy distribution from e.g. turbulence cascade.
Cascade of Burgers turbulence gives Ek ∼ k−2. Since molecular
clouds are found to have Ep ∼ k−2, this implies a equipartition be-
tween turbulence and gravitational energy across diﬀerent scales.

By investigating the gravitational energy spectra of individual
molecular clouds in details, we ﬁnd that molecular clouds can be
broadly divided into two categories. The g-type includes the clouds
shallow surface density PDFs (γN < 2, including e.g. the Persues
and the Orion A molecular cloud). Inside these clouds, the gravita-
tional energy exceeds by much the turbulence energy from cascade.
As a result, it is diﬃcult for turbulence to support these clouds.
Either they are experiencing gravitational collapses (Ballesteros-

mann 2004), or they are supported by other physics, such as mag-
netic ﬁelds (Tan et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014). The t-type includes
clouds with steep slopes of the column density PDFs (γN > 2, for
example, the Pipe nebula and the California molecular cloud). For
them, the bulk turbulence energy exceeds the gravitational energy
at small scales, and the sub-regions in these clouds can be supported
by turbulence. This theoretical distinction is supported observa-
tions, in that the ﬁrst type of clouds (the gravity-dominated type)
are forming stars actively, and the second type (the turbulence-
dominated type) are relatively quiescent.

The fact that gravity takes over turbulence on every given
physical scale for clouds like Orion A is interesting and deserves
further investigations e.g. Burkert & Hartmann (2013). There are
diﬀerent models of cloud evolution. Because of the large amount
of gravitational energy distributed across various physical scales,
many of the turbulent motions in molecular cloud can and should
be explained as a result of gravity (Heyer et al. 2009; Ibáñez-Mejía
et al. 2015; Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2011).

Our results provide a reﬁned, multi-scale picture of gravity
in cloud evolution. The analytical formulas in Sec. 2.4 are help-
ful for interpreting observations that are related to column den-
sity PDFs. Equation 13 can be used to convert observed column
density distributions into the multi-scale gravitational energy spec-
trum. It leads to a critical theoretical criterion to separate molecu-
lar clouds into two distinct types (turbulence-dominated type and
collapsing/magnetically supported type). A uniﬁed theory of star
formation should take this distinction into account.
