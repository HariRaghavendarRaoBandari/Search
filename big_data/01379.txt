GEOMETRIC HARDY INEQUALITIES FOR THE SUB-ELLIPTIC

LAPLACIAN ON CONVEX DOMAINS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP

SIMON LARSON

Abstract. We prove geometric Lp versions of Hardy’s inequality for the sub-elliptic Laplacian
on convex domains Ω in the Heisenberg group Hn, where convex is meant in the Euclidean
sense. When p = 2 and Ω is the half-space given by hξ, νi > d this generalizes an inequality
previously obtained by Luan and Yang. For such p and Ω the inequality is sharp and takes
the form

where an element ξ ∈ Hn is written as ξ = (x, y, t), with x, y ∈ Rn and t ∈ R, and Hn
+ := {ξ ∈
Hn : t > 0}. In this paper we provide a diﬀerent proof of this inequality, generalize it to any
half-space of Hn and use it to obtain a weighted geometric Hardy inequality on a convex domain
Ω, where convex is meant in the Euclidean sense. The weight that appears in our results is in
some sense a natural sub-elliptic weighting of the Euclidean distance and is closely related to
distances studied in [14, 16].

We begin with a short introduction providing the basic deﬁnitions, notation and background

necessary for the sequel.

The n-dimensional Heisenberg group, which we denote by Hn, may be described as the set

R2n+1 equipped with the group law

ˆξ ◦ ˜ξ := (ˆx + ˜x, ˆy + ˜y, ˆt + ˜t + 2

(˜xi ˆyi − ˆxi ˜yi)),

nXi=1

where we use the notation ξ = (x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn, t) = (x, y, t) ∈ R2n+1. The inverse element
of ξ, with respect to the group law, is denoted by ξ−1 and we note that ξ−1 = −ξ. The group
law induces the following dilation operation

δλ(ξ) := (λx, λy, λ2t)

for λ > 0.

The Lie algebra of left-invariant vector ﬁelds on Hn is spanned by

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, together with their commutators. The only non-zero commutators are

[Xi, Yi] = −4

∂
∂t

.

We also deﬁne the associated gradient ∇Hn := (X1, . . . , Xn, Y1, . . . , Yn) and the Heisenberg
i . The collection of vector ﬁelds

Laplacian ∆Hn on Hn, formally given by ∆Hn :=Pn

i + Y 2
{Xi, Yi : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} satisﬁes the H¨ormander ﬁnite rank condition:

i=1 X 2

Rank Lie[X1, . . . , Xn, Y1, . . . , Yn] = 2n + 1.

Thus the Heisenberg Laplacian is a second order hypoelliptic diﬀerential operator [10].

We call a Lipschitz curve γ : I ⊂ R → Hn horizontal if its tangent at almost every τ ∈ I is

spanned by the Xi and Yi, that is, for a.e. τ ∈ I there exist a, b ∈ Rn such that

We denote the set of all horizontal curves γ : I → Hn by SHn (I) and for a given γ ∈ SHn (I) we
deﬁne its length l(γ) as

γ′(τ ) =

aiXi(γ(τ )) + biYi(γ(τ )).

nXi=1

l(γ) :=ZI(cid:0)|a(τ )|2 + |b(τ )|2(cid:1)1/2

dτ.

By the accessibility theorem of Chow and Rashevsky any pair of points ξ0, ξ1 ∈ Ω where Ω is an
open connected subset of Hn can be joined by a horizontal curve γ : [0, 1] → Hn of ﬁnite length
(see [5, 15]).

The Carnot–Carath´eodory distance δcc on Hn is deﬁned as

δcc(ξ0, ξ1) := inf{l(γ) : γ ∈ SHn ([0, 1]), γ(0) = ξ0, γ(1) = ξ1}.

The Carnot–Carath´eodory distance is not the only distance that has a natural connection to
Hn. A second distance that arises naturally when considering the fundamental solution of ∆Hn
is the Kaplan distance (see [9]):

where ρ is the Kaplan gauge on Hn deﬁned by

δK(ξ0, ξ1) := ρ(ξ−1

1 ◦ ξ0),

ρ(ξ) :=(cid:0)(|x|2 + |y|2)2 + 4t2(cid:1)1/4
It turns out that the two distance functions above are bi-Lipschitz equivalent, that is, there exists
a constant C > 0 such that for all ξ0, ξ1 ∈ Hn we have that

.

C−1δK(ξ0, ξ1) ≤ δcc(ξ0, ξ1) ≤ CδK(ξ0, ξ1).

Let M ⊂ Hn be a 2n-dimensional C1 manifold. We call a point ξ0 ∈ M a characteristic point
of M if the tangent space Tξ0M is spanned by {Xi(ξ0),, Yi(ξ0) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
Even though both δcc and δK appear naturally when considering the geometric structure of
Hn these distances can be rather diﬃcult to work with, see for instance the work of Arcozzi
and Ferrari [1, 2]. Extra diﬃculties arise when studying the behaviour of the distance to a
hypersurface M close to one of its characteristic points.

In what follows we will be interested in inequalities of the form

(2)

ZΩ |∇Hn u(ξ)|p dξ ≥ CZΩ

|u(ξ)|p
ρ(ξ, ∂Ω)p dξ,

where Ω ⊂ Hn, p ≥ 2 and ρ is some, possibly weighted, distance from ξ to the boundary of Ω. In
the Euclidean setting, with ∇Hn replaced by the usual gradient and ρ by the Euclidean distance,
such inequalities have a long history and wide range of applications (see, for instance, [4, 8, 13]).

GEOMETRIC HARDY INEQUALITIES ON CONVEX DOMAINS IN Hn

In the setting of the Heisenberg group results of this kind have been obtained through methods
based on sub-elliptic capacity and Feﬀerman–Phong inequalities. In [7] the authors provide sharp
conditions on the triple Ω, ρ and C for the validity of (2). However, the results obtained in [7] are
of a rather non-explicit nature and what they say in a speciﬁc setting is not very approachable.
One of the obstacles in proving inequalities of the form (2) on domains in Hn is that the
If Ω = Hn \ {ξ0} and ρ
natural distances on Hn (δcc, δK) are rather diﬃcult to work with.
is the Carnot–Carath´eodory or Kaplan distance to the point ξ0 ∈ Hn inequalities of this form
have been studied in a several articles (see, for instance, [6, 9, 11, 17]). However, when ∂Ω is a
more complicated set the problem becomes more diﬃcult. Results concerning the behaviour of
the distance from sets and a detailed analysis of the problems arising can be found in work by
Arcozzi and Ferrari [1, 2].

In this article we begin by generalizing (1) to the case where Ω is an arbitrary half-space of Hn.
The proof given here diﬀers from that given in [12] and contains their result as a special case.
Moreover, from our proof of (1) and the corresponding generalizations we are able to apply a
standard argument and ﬁnd Lp versions of the inequalities.

In Section 3, we combine our inequalities for half-spaces with a method used by Avkhadiev in
the Euclidean setting [3] to obtain an inequality of the form (2) for convex domains in Hn, here
convex is meant in the Euclidean sense, and with ρ being a weighted Euclidean distance. More
speciﬁcally we have that

ρ(ξ)p =

|hXi(ξ), ν(ξ)i|p + |hYi(ξ), ν(ξ)i|p

dist(ξ, ∂Ω)p

nXi=1

where p ≥ 2, dist(· , ∂Ω) denotes the Euclidean distance to the boundary of Ω and ν(ξ) ∈ S2n is
such that ξ + dist(ξ, ∂Ω)ν(ξ) ∈ ∂Ω.

2. Hardy inequalities on half-spaces of Hn

For ν ∈ S2n and d ∈ R let Πν,d be the hyperplane in Hn deﬁned by the equation hξ, νi = d.

ν,d be the half-space of Hn where hξ, νi > d.

Correspondingly, let Π+

By choosing ν to be the unit vector in the t direction and d to be zero the above theorem

reduces to (1).

In the case of a half-space it was pointed out to us by Ruszkowski that outside a certain cone the
weighted distance appearing in Theorem 2.1 is comparable to the Carnot–Carath´eodory distance
on the Heisenberg group. In fact, the weighted distance coincides with a reduced version of the
Carnot–Carath´eodory distance [14, 16], namely

w(ξ, ∂Ω) := inf{δcc(ξ, ˆξ) : ˆξ ∈ ∂Ω ∩ Span(Xi(ξ), Yi(ξ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n)}.

For results concerning this reduced distance and Hardy inequalities closely related to those ob-
tained here we refer to [14] and an upcoming article by Ruszkowski and Weidl [16].

We proceed by providing a factorization-type proof of the above theorem and also sketch
how to obtain the same statement from (1) through a simple translation argument. The second
argument has the slight advantage that it gives a geometric interpretation of the weight appearing
in the inequality, but most importantly it simpliﬁes the proof that (3) is sharp. However, later
in the article we will need the calculations performed in our ﬁrst proof.

Choosing α to maximize −α(1 + α) completes the proof.

(cid:3)

As mentioned above the theorem admits a second proof through a translation argument, and
we proceed by sketching this alternative proof. The main reason for including this is that it
reduces the proof of sharpness of (3) to considering a given half-space, but it also gives a second
geometric interpretation of the weight appearing in the theorem.

We sketch the proof only in the case of H1. The ideas translate without change to higher
dimension but the geometry of the argument is more transparent in the case n = 1. For simplicity
we will also only deal with the case d = 0, i.e. a plane passing through the origin.

For ν = (νx, νy, νt) ∈ S2, let Πν be the plane in H1 deﬁned by the equation hξ, νi = 0. If
νt 6= 0 we can ﬁnd a ξ0 ∈ Πν such that ξ0 is a characteristic point of Πν. This reduces to solving
the following system of equations:

hX(ξ), νi = 0,
hY (ξ), νi = 0,
hξ, νi = 0.



GEOMETRIC HARDY INEQUALITIES ON CONVEX DOMAINS IN Hn

From the ﬁrst two equations we ﬁnd that

x =

νy
2νt

and y = −

νx
2νt

which combined with the third equation gives the solution

ξ0 =

1

2νt

νy

0  .

Applying a change of variables given by left translation by −ξ0 and using the left-invariance of
X and Y reduces the left-hand side of inequality (3) to the case of Πν = {ξ ∈ H1 : t = 0}. Thus
we may apply (1). Changing back variables the right-hand side becomes, after some algebraic
manipulations, the desired expression. For arbitrary non-vertical planes (νt 6= 0) the argument
goes through without any substantial change. For vertical planes (νt = 0) the result can be found
through a simple limiting process.

In the case treated by Luan and Yang the term |x|2 + |y|2 has a clear interpretation as the
square of the Euclidean distance to the centre of H1, which here actually coincides with the
Carnot–Carath´eodory distance. This is precisely the distance from ξ to the subspace of H1
consisting of points where ν is orthogonal to both X and Y .

The translation argument above then provides the interpretation that the weight corresponds
to the Carnot–Carath´eodory distance from the subspace where the Xi and Yi span a hyperplane
which is parallel to Πν, multiplied by a factor corresponding to how ”tilted” Πν is. If we let Hν
denote the subspace of H1 given by {ξ ∈ H1 : X(ξ) ⊥ ν, Y (ξ) ⊥ ν} one ﬁnds that

hX(ξ), νi2 + hY (ξ), νi2

cc(ξ,Hν ).

One should note that this weight behaves well with respect to both ξ and ν. In particular, if we
let νt tend to zero this converges to 1/4. As this leads to a rather surprising invariance of the
Hardy inequality with respect to any choice of vertical plane we state this as a corollary.

With the above translation argument in hand we see that to prove the sharpness (3) it suﬃces
to consider a given pair of ν ∈ S2n and d ∈ R. Thus we restrict our attention to the case
ν,d = {(x, y, t) ∈ Hn : t ≥ 0}, that is, ν = (0, . . . , 0, 1) and d = 0. We will also make use of the

which follows by a simple dimensionality argument. Hence the constant appearing in Theorem 2.1

follows by a limiting procedure but can also be found by an almost identical variational argument
but considering a slightly diﬀerent quotient.

The above Lp version of our Hardy inequality on a half-space is perhaps not the most natural

generalization of Theorem 2.1; a more natural weight in the right-hand side of (5) would be

However, by Jensen’s inequality it is easy to see that Theorem 2.3 implies a Hardy inequality
with the above weight but with a worse constant. We believe that such an inequality should

By a similar argument as in the case p = 2 we can prove that the constant is sharp in the

sense that if it were replaced by a larger constant we could choose Π+
fails. To achieve this we wish to ﬁnd an upper bound for the quantity

In the case p = 2 things are slightly simpler and the above quotient splits into three parts,
one of which easily can be seen to be zero and another which can be eliminated by a simple
scaling argument. However, in the general case we cannot in such a simple manner split the
above integral. But using Jensen’s inequality we can bound the quotient by some appropriately

By a simple rescaling argument in t, by say replacing w(t) by ew(t) = w(λt) with λ > 0,

one sees that we independently of choice of φ can make the last two terms arbitrarily small.
Moreover, since the ﬁrst term is independent of w we can use the sharp Hardy inequality in R2n

Since we have lost all dependence on c2 and c3 we are free to choose the ai in such a way that c1

3. Hardy inequalities for convex domains in Hn

We now turn our attention to using Theorem 2.1 to obtain a geometric version of Hardy’s

inequality on convex domains in Hn.
Theorem 3.1. Let Ω be a convex domain in Hn. For ξ ∈ Ω let ν(ξ) denote the unit normal of
∂Ω at a point ˆξ ∈ ∂Ω, where ˆξ is such that dist(ξ, ∂Ω) = dist( ˆξ, ξ). Then for any u ∈ C∞
0 (Ω) we

have that

ZΩ |∇Hn u|2 dξ ≥

1

4ZΩ

nXi=1

hXi(ξ), ν(ξ)i2 + hYi(ξ), ν(ξ)i2

dist(ξ, ∂Ω)2

|u|2 dξ.

Note that we do not require the domain Ω to be bounded. In particular if Ω is a half-space of
Hn this is precisely Theorem 2.1. The proof is based on an approach used in [3] and proceeds along
the same lines as the that of Theorem 2.1 with an additional element in which we approximate
the domain Ω by convex polytopes.

10

SIMON LARSON

Proof of Theorem 3.1. We begin by proving the inequality when Ω is a convex polytope. Let
{Fk}k be the facets of Ω with corresponding inward pointing unit normals {νk}k. Further we con-
struct a partition of Ω into the essentially disjoint sets Ωk := {ξ ∈ Ω : dist(ξ, ∂Ω) = dist(ξ, Fk)}.
Since the partition elements Ωk are deﬁned through a ﬁnite number of aﬃne inequalities they
are polytopes.

For each partition element Ωk we can now apply the same idea as in the proof of the previous
theorem. The only diﬀerence will be that not all the boundary terms from the partial integration
are zero. In each Ωk we deﬁne the potential V with components

Vi(ξ) = hXi(ξ), νki
dist(ξ, Fk)
Vn+i(ξ) = hYi(ξ), νki
dist(ξ, Fk)
Through the same calculations as before one ﬁnds that

where nk(ξ) denotes the outward pointing unit normal of ∂Ωk at ξ. Note that on Fk ⊂ ∂Ωk we
have that nk(ξ) = −νk.
Since u is compactly supported in Ω the boundary contribution from ∂Ω is again zero, and
thus all we need to deal with are the parts of ∂Ωk that are in the interior of Ω. For each such
facet of Ωk there is some Ωl, l 6= k, that shares this facet. Let Γkl denote the common facet of
Ωk and Ωl, and note that nk|Γkl = −nl|Γkl . Summing over all partition elements Ωk and letting
nkl = nk|Γkl , i.e. the unit normal of Γkl pointing from Ωk into Ωl, we obtain using the earlier
calculations for the components of V that

In the last equality we use the fact that Γkl is by deﬁnition the set where dist(ξ, Fk) = dist(ξ, Fl).

By construction we have that

Γkl = {ξ : ξ · νk − dk = ξ · νl − dl}.

Rearranging we ﬁnd that ξ · (νk − νl) − dk + dl = 0, that is, Γkl is a hyperplane with normal
νk− νl. Therefore, we have νk− νl k nkl and all that remains to do is check that (νk− νl)·nkl > 0.

GEOMETRIC HARDY INEQUALITIES ON CONVEX DOMAINS IN Hn

11

Since νk points into k-th partition element and nkl points out, νk · nkl is non-negative. By the
same argument the term νl · nkl is non-positive. Therefore, the entire expression is non-negative
and moreover we have that

|νk − νl|2 = (νk − νl) · (νk − νl) = 2 − 2νk · νl

= 2 − 2 cos(αkl),

where αkl is the angle between νk and νl. Thus (νk − νl) · nkl = √2 − 2 cos αkl and equation (6)

gives us that

3.1. Lp Hardy inequality for a convex domain. Again we can make slight alterations to
the proof above to obtain Lp-inequalities, p ≥ 2, on convex domains. We summarize the results
in the following theorem.
Theorem 3.2. Let Ω be a convex domain in Hn and for ξ ∈ Ω let ν(ξ) denote the unit normal
of ∂Ω at a point ˆξ ∈ ∂Ω, where ˆξ is such that dist(ξ, ∂Ω) = dist( ˆξ, ξ). Then for any p ≥ 2 and
u ∈ C∞

Proof of Theorem 3.2. The proof of the theorem is very similar to the proof presented above for
the L2 case. We again begin with the case when Ω is a polytope and consider the same partition
Ωk. For g ∈ H 1(Ωk) and V ∈ C∞(Ωk; R2n+1) the divergence theorem gives us that

Consider the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side. Using H¨older’s and Young’s inequalities we have
that

−pZΩk

ghV,∇uisgn(u)|u|p−1 dξ ≤ p(cid:16)ZΩk |hV,∇ui|p dξ(cid:17)1/p(cid:16)ZΩk |g|p/(p−1)|u|p dξ(cid:17)(p−1)/p

≤ZΩk |hV,∇ui|p dξ + (p − 1)ZΩk |g|p/(p−1)|u|p dξ.

Inserting this into 3.1 and rearranging the terms we obtain

Choosing V = Xi and letting

we see by the same calculations as earlier that

C(α, p)ZΩk

where

C(α, p) = −(p − 1)(α − |α|p/(p−1)).

hXi(ξ), nk(ξ)i|u|p dΓ∂Ωk (ξ)

Maximizing this constant in α we ﬁnd as before that

where the maximum is attained at

,

p (cid:17)p
C(α, p) ≤(cid:16) p − 1
α = −(cid:16) p − 1
p (cid:17)p−1

.

What remains to complete the proof is to show that we can discard the boundary terms after

summing over the Ωk, in other words we need to prove that

−(cid:16) p − 1

p (cid:17)p−1Xk Z∂Ωk

hXi(ξ), nk(ξ)i|u|p dΓ∂Ωk (ξ) ≤ 0.

As in the L2 case only the boundary terms that come from the interior of Ω are non-zero, and
again these appear in pairs. Thus, in the same manner as before we wish to show that

(7)

ZΓkl(cid:20)sgn(hXi(ξ), νki)(cid:18)|hXi(ξ), νki|

hXi(ξ), nkli

hXi(ξ), nkli(cid:21)|u|p dΓkl

is non-negative.

GEOMETRIC HARDY INEQUALITIES ON CONVEX DOMAINS IN Hn

13

Using this combined with the fact that dist(ξ, Fk) = dist(ξ, Fl) on Γkl we ﬁnd that (7) can be
rewritten as

By the same geometric considerations as above nkl = β(νk−νl), where β = 1/p2 − 2 cos(αkl).
βZΓklh|hXi(ξ), νki|p − sgn(hXi(ξ), νki)|hXi(ξ), νki|p−1hXi(ξ), νli
+ |hXi(ξ), νli|p − sgn(hXi(ξ), νli)|hXi(ξ), νli|p−1hXi(ξ), νkii

Thus it suﬃces to proof that the expression in the brackets is positive. Clearly this is positive
when hXi(ξ), νki and hXi(ξ), νli have diﬀerent signs. On the other hand if the two scalar products
have the same sign we have an expression of the form Ap − Ap−1B − Bp−1A + Bp−1, where
A = |hXi(ξ), νki| and B = |hXi(ξ), νli|. But this we can rewrite as

|u|p

dist(ξ, Fk)p−1 dΓkl.

Ap − Ap−1B − Bp−1A + Bp−1 = (Ap−1 − Bp−1)(A − B).

Now it is clear that both terms on the right-hand side have the same sign. Thus (7) is non-
negative and we conclude that the boundary terms can be discarded.

By almost identical calculations we ﬁnd the corresponding inequalities for the Yi. Summing
all terms and using Jensen’s inequality as in the proof of Theorem 2.3 we obtain the desired
inequality for polytopes. The proof of the theorem can now be completed in the same manner
as for Theorem 3.1.
