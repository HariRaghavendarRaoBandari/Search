Abstract. We ﬁnd a criterion for the embedding of a nonsplit central extension
of PSLn(q) with kernel of prime order into the permutation wreath product that
corresponds to the action on the projective space.

Keywords: ﬁnite simple groups, permutation module, central cover, group

1. Introduction

A group B included in a short exact sequence of groups

1 → A ι→ B → C → 1

is called an extension of A by C and denoted by A.C in general, or by A ⋋ C if it is
split. The extension B is central if ι(A) 6 Z(B).

We write Zn for a cyclic group of order n and (m, n) for gcd(m, n).
This note concerns the following

Problem 1. Let G = PSLn(q), where q is a prime power, and let r be a prime
divisor of (n, q − 1). Does the permutation wreath product Zr ≀ρ G contain a subgroup
isomorphic to the nonsplit central extension Zr.G, where ρ is the natural permutation
representation of G on the points of the projective space Pn−1(q)?

We remark that the nonsplit extension Zr.G mentioned in Problem 1 is unique
up to isomorphism and is a quotient of SLn(q). This problem is a generalization of
the one raised in [1, p. 67], where the case n = r is considered. The case n = 2 was
studied in [2], where it was shown that the embedding holds if and only if q ≡ −1
mod 4. We generalize this result by proving the following

Theorem 2. In the notation of Problem 1, the nonsplit central extension Zr.G is
embedded into Zr ≀ρ G if and only if r does not divide (q − 1)/(n, q − 1).

The main method that we use is based on some cohomological considerations and

is similar to that of [2].

Let G be a group and let L, M be right G-modules. Suppose

are exact sequences of modules and groups, where the conjugation action of E on M
agrees with the G-module structure, i. e. me = m · π(e) for all m ∈ M and e ∈ E,
and we identify M with its image in E. A subgroup S 6 E such that

(2)

S ∩ M = L,

SM = E,

where we also identify L with its image in M , which is itself an extension of L by G,
will be called a subextension of E that corresponds to the embedding (1).

It is known [3] that the equivalence classes of extensions of L by G are in a one-to-
one correspondence with (thus are deﬁned by) the elements of the second cohomology
group H 2(G, L). Furthermore, the sequence (1) gives rise to a homomorphism

(3)

H 2(G, L)

ϕ
→ H 2(G, M ).

Lemma 3. [2, Lemma 2] Let L, M be G-modules and E an extension as speciﬁed
above. Let ¯γ ∈ H 2(G, M ) be the element that deﬁnes E. Then the set of elements
of H 2(G, L) that deﬁne the subextensions S of E corresponding to the embedding (1)
coincides with ϕ−1(¯γ), where ϕ is the induced homomorphism (3). In particular, E
has such a subextension S if and only if ¯γ ∈ Im ϕ.

We now present a slight generalization of the argument in [2, Section 7].
Denote by Fq a ﬁnite ﬁeld of order q. The order of a group element g will be

denoted by |g|.

Let G be a ﬁnite group, X a set, and let ρ be a permutation representation of G
on X. For a prime p, we consider the permutation FpG-module V that corresponds

to ρ with basis (identiﬁed with) X and its trivial submodule I spanned by Px∈X x.

Clearly, the wreath product Zp ≀ρ G is the natural split extension V ⋋ G.

Lemma 4. In the above notation, if a central extension S = Zp.G is a subextension
of V ⋋ G that corresponds to the embedding of FpG-modules I → V then S has no
element s that satisﬁes the following three conditions

(i) |s| = p2,
(ii) |g| = p, where g ∈ G is the image of s under the natural epimorphism S → G.
(iii) ρ(g) has a ﬁxed point on X.

Proof. Assume to the contrary that s is such an element. Denote t = Px∈X x ∈ I.
Since S = I.G, we have sp = ct for a nonzero c ∈ Fp, and since S is a subextension
of V ⋋ G with respect to I → V , there exists v ∈ V such that s = gv. Therefore, we
have ct = sp = (gv)p = vh, where

h = 1 + g + . . . + gp−1.

Let x ∈ X be a ﬁxed point of ρ(g). We can write v = axx + w, for some ax ∈ Fp,

where w = Py∈X\{x} ayy. Clearly, wh is a linear combination of elements of X \ {x},

and

(axx)h = ax(x + . . . + x) = ax px = 0.

Hence, the coeﬃcient of x in ct = vh is zero, which contradicts c 6= 0.

3. A permutation module for PSLn(q)

We henceforth denote G = PSLn(q) and ﬁx a prime divisor r of (n, q − 1). The
natural permutation action ρ of G on the points of the projective space P = Pn−1(q)
gives rise to a permutation FrG-module V . As every permutation module, V has a

trivial submodule I spanned by Px∈P x, and the augmentation submodule V0 that

consists of the elements Px∈P axx withPx ax = 0. Since dim V = 1+q+. . .+qn−1 ≡

0 (mod r), we have I 6 V0, and the quotient U = V0/I is known [4] to be absolutely
irreducible whenever n > 3. It was noticed by various authors [5, 6] that U is one of
the few examples of modules with 2-dimensional 1-cohomology, namely we have:
Lemma 5. In the above notation, H 1(G, U ) ∼= Z2

r, whenever n ≥ 3.

We will also require the 1-cohomology of V .

Lemma 6. Let V be the above-deﬁned permutation module. Then we have

H 1(G, V ) ∼= (cid:26) Zr,

0, otherwise.

r divides (q − 1)/(n, q − 1),

Proof. We will assume that n > 3, as the claim holds for n = 2 by [2, Lemma
12]. Since the action of G on P is transitive, we have V ∼= T G, where T is the
principal FrH-module for a point stabilizer H. By Shapiro’s lemma [7, §6.3], we have
H 1(G, V ) ∼= H 1(H, T ) ∼= Hom(H/H ′, T ). The structure of H is known [8, Section
2] and has the shape ASLn−1(q).Z(q−1)/(n,q−1). Since n ≥ 3 and (n, q − 1) > 1, the
group ASLn−1(q) is perfect and so H/H ′ ∼= Z(q−1)/(n,q−1). As T is cyclic of order r,
the claim follows.
(cid:3)

4. Proof

We can now prove Theorem 2. Due to [2], we may assume that n > 3. We denote
by S the nonsplit central extension Zr.G. Since G is simple, the only possibility for
S to be a subgroup of the extension V ⋋ G is if S is its subextension, and since I
is the unique trivial submodule of V , this subextension must be with respect to the
embedding I → V . Being split, the extension V ⋋ G is deﬁned by the zero element of
H 2(G, V ). Hence, Lemma 3 implies that all subextensions of V ⋋ G with respect to
I → V are deﬁned by the elements of Ker ϕ, where ϕ is the induced homomorphism

(4)

H 2(G, I)

ϕ
→ H 2(G, V ).

The short exact sequence of modules

0 → I → V → V 0 → 0,
where V 0 ∼= V /I, gives rise to the long exact sequence

H 1(G, I) → H 1(G, V ) α→ H 1(G, V 0) δ→ H 2(G, I)

(5)
which implies that Ker ϕ = Im δ. Observe that H 1(G, I) ∼= Hom(G/G′, I) = 0,
since G is simple. Therefore, the map α in (5) is an embedding, and Ker ϕ ∼=
H 1(G, V 0)/H 1(G, V ).

ϕ
→ H 2(G, V ),

The structure of V , see [4, Lemma 2], allows us to include V 0 in the nonsplit short

exact sequence

which gives rise to the exact sequence

0 → U → V 0 → I → 0,

H 0(G, V 0) → H 0(G, I) → H 1(G, U ) → H 1(G, V 0) → H 1(G, I).

(6)
Now, H 0(G, V 0) = 0, since V 0 has no trivial submodules, and H 1(G, I) = 0 as above.
Therefore, H 1(G, V 0) ∼= H 1(G, U )/H 0(G, I). Since H 0(G, I) ∼= Zr, Lemma 5 implies
H 1(G, V 0) ∼= Zr, and so Ker ϕ is 0 or Zr according as r divides (q − 1)/(n, q − 1) or
otherwise, by Lemma 6. It follows that the nonzero element of H 2(G, I) that deﬁnes

the nonsplit extension S lies in Ker ϕ if and only if r does not divide (q − 1)/(n, q − 1).
By Lemma 3, this completes the proof of the theorem.

In the case when r divides (q − 1)/(n, q − 1), we can also prove the nonembedding
of S into V ⋋ G in a diﬀerent way. Suppose this is the case. Then Fq has an element
a of multiplicative order r(n, q − 1). Let s be the image in S of diag(a, a, . . . , a, a1−n)
under the epimorphism SLn(q) → S. We have |s| = r2 and |g| = r, where g is the
image of s under the epimorphism S → G. Observe that ρ(g) has a ﬁxed point on
P, because every diagonal element of SLn(q) ﬁxes a point on P, e. g. the projective
image of the basis vector (1, 0, . . . , 0). Therefore, S cannot be a subextension of V ⋋G
by Lemma 4.
