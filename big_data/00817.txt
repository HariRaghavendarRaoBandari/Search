Abstract

As we age, our hearts undergo changes which result in reduction in complexity of physio-
logical interactions between diﬀerent control mechanisms. This results in a potential risk
of cardiovascular diseases which are the number one cause of death globally. Since cardiac
signals are nonstationary and nonlinear in nature, complexity measures are better suited
to handle such data. In this study, non-invasive methods for detection of cardiac aging us-
ing complexity measures are explored. Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity, Approximate Entropy
(ApEn) and Eﬀort-to-Compress (ETC) measures are used to diﬀerentiate between healthy
young and old subjects using heartbeat interval data. We show that both LZ and ETC
complexity measures are able to diﬀerentiate between young and old subjects with only 10
data samples while ApEn requires at least 15 data samples.

1. Introduction

It is well known that functions of all physio-
logical systems are greatly altered during the
process of aging. Among these, the cardio-
vascular system has received prominent at-
tention due to the high death rate attributed
to heart related diseases. In fact, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has labeled car-
diovascular diseases as the number one cause

of death globally [1]. Hence, study of cardiac
aging has been an important area in clinical
medicine, and understanding heart rate pat-
terns is an essential step in this study.
In
the 1980’s, chaos theory began being used to
investigate heart beat dynamics [2, 3, 4]. Ini-
tially, researchers had assumed that patho-
logical systems were the ones that produce
chaotic time series. They therefore tried us-

ing the concepts of nonlinear theory in mod-
eling pathologies like cardiac arrhythmias,
which initiated the process of understanding
the behaviour and dynamics of atrial or ven-
tricular ﬁbrillation [5]. But contrary to ear-
lier theories,
it was found that cardiac ar-
rhythmia doesn’t display chaotic dynamics
[6].
It was indeed a surprise when further
studies led to the discovery that cardiac chaos
is not found in pathological systems but in
the dynamics of normal sinus rhythm [7, 8, 9].
Goldberger, in his seminal work on heart
beat dynamics [10], points out that even dur-
ing bed rest, the heart rate in healthy individ-
uals is not constant or periodic, but shows ir-
regular patterns that are typically associated
with a chaotic non-linear system. A detailed
analysis of the beat-to-beat heart rate vari-
ability time series shows that there is no par-
ticular time scale for this behaviour and it is
seen in all orders of magnitude (hours, min-
utes and seconds). This self-similar structure
lends credence to the fact that a fractal fea-
ture of chaotic dynamics exists in these time
series data. This has been further veriﬁed by
Goldberger [10] by performing spectral anal-
ysis on normal heart time series, which re-
vealed a broad spectrum with a continuum
of frequency components, indicating a high
possibility of presence of chaos. Added to
this, the phase space mapping of the heart
rate time series produced strange attractors,
not limit cycles, which clearly indicates the
presence of underlying chaotic dynamics in
the heart rate variability data. It has been
surmised that this chaotic behaviour is due
to the fact that a healthy physiological con-
dition is deﬁned by complex interactions be-

tween multiple control mechanisms. These
interactions are essential for the individual
to adapt to the ever changing external en-
vironment. These highly adaptive and com-
plex mechanisms lead to a very irregular ﬁr-
ing rate of the pacemaker cells in the heart’s
sinus node, resulting in a chaotic heart rate
variability [5].

Looking at this physiological response of
healthy individuals, a natural question that
arises is: ‘How long can this complex interac-
tion continue? What happens as the person
gets older?’ This was the focus of study by
Goldberger et al.
in [11]. They point out
that, during the process of aging, there occur
two eﬀects that aﬀect the complexity of the
interactions among the control mechanisms.

1. Progressive impairment of

functional

components.

2. Altering of nonlinear coupling between

these components.

Due to these eﬀects, the physiological func-
tions no longer show multitudes of variations
but slowly settle down to a more regular na-
ture. This results in a decrease of complexity
in heart rate variability in healthy older indi-
viduals. This also explains why researchers
are motivated to use complexity measures
(such as approximate entropy, Lempel-Ziv
complexity and other measures) to study car-
diac aging, as such measures are known to aid
the detection of the regularity inherent in the
cardiac time series. From a clinical applica-
tion perspective, it is desirable to have a com-
plexity measure that can aid this detection in
real-time (hence should be able to work with
small number of samples), and also be robust

2

to noise or missing data.

2. Existing studies and their limita-

tions

Statistical measures like mean and variance
can’t adequately quantify complex chaotic-
like behaviour. This is because systems with
very diﬀerent dynamics may have very similar
means and variances. Hence Goldberger et al.
in [12] have used the following two measures
to capture the complex nonlinear variability
of the physiological processes.

1. Measurement of the dimension of the
the

system that describes

nonlinear
physiological data variations.

2. Calculation of ApEn (Approximate En-

tropy) of the physiological time series.

Using beat-to-beat heart rate signals col-
lected from 16 healthy young subjects and
18 healthy elderly subjects, they demonstrate
that the complexity of cardiovascular dynam-
ics reduces with aging. Similar studies have
also been done using fractal measures like
‘detrended ﬂuctuation analysis’ to quantify
long range correlation properties in [13, 14] to
show that complexity of heart beat variablity
decreases with aging. Use of multifractality,
sample entropy and wavelet analysis has been
explored in [15]. Nemati et al.
in [16] use
band-limited transfer entropy to characterize
cardiac aging, with an added purpose of dis-
covering the eﬀect of respiration and blood
pressure on complexity of heart rate variabil-
ity due to aging phenomenon.

All the aforementioned studies have used
very long data sequences, running into 1000s

3

of data samples for their analysis.
Some
methods that are used, namely ‘detrended
ﬂuctuation analysis’ and approximate dimen-
sion require such large data sets to eﬀectively
quantify the complexity.

Looking at the fractal nature of the heart
beat variability data, there is a high pos-
sibility that short data sequences would be
enough to fully characterize the structure in
the time series, provided the complexity mea-
sure can handle short sequences eﬀectively.
Takahashi in [17] has used conditional en-
tropy and symbolic analysis with sequences
of length 200 for diﬀerentiating between heart
beat intervals of young and old subjects. We
go a step ahead and use sequences shorter
than that. Our goal is to compare the useful-
ness of Eﬀort-to-Compress (ETC [18]), Ap-
proximate Entropy (ApEn [19]), and Lempel-
Ziv (LZ [20]) complexity measures in auto-
matic identiﬁcation of cardiac aging using
very short length inter-beat time series data.
It is conceivable that longer inter-beat time
series data may not be practically available,
or that the long sequence may be unreliable
due to contamination by noise.
In such in-
stances, it is always beneﬁcial to rely upon
short length time series data, especially if it
were to be useful in a practical setting.

In the next section, we brieﬂy introduce
the three complexity measures that we have
used in our study. In section 4 we describe
the experimental setup, followed by compar-
ative analysis in section 5. We conclude with
future research directions in section 6.

3. Complexity Measures

In this section, we introduce the reader to

LZ, ApEn and ETC complexity measures.

3.1. Lempel-Ziv complexity

Lempel-Ziv complexity is a popular mea-
sure in the ﬁeld of biomedical data character-
ization [21, 22]. To compute the Lempel-Ziv
complexity, the given data (if numerical) has
to be ﬁrst converted to a symbolic sequence.
This symbolic sequence is then parsed from
left to right to identify the number of dis-
tinct patterns present in the sequence. This
method of parsing is proposed in the semi-
nal work on Lempel-Ziv complexity [20]. The
very succinct description in [23] is reproduced
here.
Let S = s1s2 · · · sn denote a symbolic se-
quence; S(i, j) denote a substring of S that
starts at position i and ends at position j;
V (S) denote the set of all substrings (S(i, j)
for i = 1, 2, · · · n; and j ≥ i). For example,
let S = abc, then V (S) = {a, b, c, ab, bc, abc}.
The parsing mechanism involves a left-to-
right scan of the symbolic sequence S. Start
with i = 1 and j = 1. A substring S(i, j)
is compared with all strings in V (S(i, j − 1))
(Let V(S(1,0)) = {}, the empty set). If S(i, j)
is present in V (S(1, j −1)), then increase j by
1 and repeat the process. If the substring is
not present, then place a dot after S(i, j) to
indicate the end of a new component, set i =
j + 1, increase j by 1, and the process contin-
ues. This parsing procedure continues until
j = n, where n is the length of the sym-
bolic sequence. For example, the sequence

‘aacgacga’ is parsed as ‘a.ac.g.acga.’. By con-
vention, a dot is placed after the last element
of the symbolic sequence and the number of
dots gives us the number of distinct words
which is taken as the LZ complexity, denoted
by c(n). In this example, the number of dis-
tinct words (LZ complexity) is 4.

Since we may need to compare sequences
of diﬀerent lengths, a normalized measure
is proposed and is denoted by CLZ and ex-
pressed as :

CLZ = (c(n)/n)logαn.

(1)

where α denotes the number of unique sym-
bols in the symbol set [24].

3.2. Approximate Entropy (ApEn)

Approximate entropy is a complexity mea-
sure used to quantify regularity of time se-
ries, especially short and noisy sequences [19].
ApEn is a measure that monitors how much
a set of patterns that are close together for a
few observations, still retains its closeness on
comparing the next few observations. Basi-
cally it checks for the convergence and diver-
gence of patterns to check the complexity of
the given sequence. If neighbouring patterns
retain the same closeness, then we infer it to
be a more regular pattern, with a concomi-
tant lower ApEn value. The measure been
deﬁned in [19] and we reproduce the deﬁni-
tion here. Two input parameters, m and r,
must be initially chosen for the computation
of the measure - m being the length of the
patterns we want to compare each time for
closeness, and r being a tolerance factor for
the regularity of the two sets of patterns be-
ing compared.

4

Given a sequence u of length N, we now deﬁne
the complexity ApEn(m,r,N) as follows.

• Form vector sequences x(1) through
x(N −m+1) deﬁned by x(i) = [u(i), u(i+
1), ...u(i + m − 1)], representing m con-
secutive u values, starting from the ith
value.

• Deﬁne the distance d[x(i), x(j)] between
vectors x(i) and x(j) as the maximum
diﬀerence in their respective scalar com-
ponents.

• For each i ≤ N − m + 1, calculate the
number of j ≤ N − m + 1 such that
d[x(i), x(j)] ≤ r and call the number as
k(i).

• For each i ≤ N − m + 1, calculate the
parameters C m
i (r) = k(i)/(N − m + 1).
These parameters measure, within a tol-
erance r, the regularity or frequency
of patterns similar to given pattern of
length m.

• Deﬁne

φm(r) =

PN −m+1

i=1

ln C m
N − m + 1

i (r)

(2)

• Using this, ApEn complexity measure is

deﬁned as

ApEn(m, r, N) = φm(r) − φm+1(r) (3)

It has been shown in [19]

for
m=1 and 2, values of r between 0.1
to 0.25SD(standard deviation) of the se-
quence provide good statistical validity of

that

ApEn(m, r, N). In our analysis, we use m=1
and r = 0.25SD(standard deviation) of the
sequence.

3.3. Eﬀort-to-Compress (ETC) complexity

Eﬀort-to-Compress (ETC) is a recently
proposed complexity measure that is based
on the eﬀort required by a lossless compres-
sion algorithm to compress a given sequence
[18]. The measure has been proposed us-
ing a lossless compression algorithm known
as Non-sequential Recursive Pair Substitu-
tion (NSRPS). The algorithm for compress-
ing a given sequence of symbols proceeds as
follows. At the ﬁrst iteration, that pair of
symbols which has maximum number of oc-
currences is replaced with a new symbol. For
example, the input sequence ‘11010010’
is
transformed into ‘12202’ since the pair ‘10’
has maximum number of occurrences com-
pared to other pairs (‘00’, ‘01’ and ‘11’). In
the second iteration, ‘12202’ is transformed
to ‘3202’ since ‘12’ has maximum frequency
(in fact all pairs are equally likely). The algo-
rithm proceeds in this fashion until the length
of the string is 1 or the string becomes a con-
stant sequence (at which stage the entropy is
zero and the algorithm halts).
In this ex-
ample, the algorithm transforms the input
sequence ‘11010010’ 7→ ‘12202’ 7→ ‘3202’ 7→
‘402’ 7→ ‘52’ 7→ ‘6’.

The ETC measure is deﬁned as N, the
number of iterations required for the input
sequence to be transformed to a constant se-
quence through the usage of NSRPS algo-
rithm. N is an integer that varies between
0 and L − 1, where L stands for the length

5

of the input symbolic sequence. The normal-
ized version of the measure is given by: N
(Note: 0 ≤ N

L−1 ≤ 1).

4. Experimental setup

Data used for our experiment was obtained
from ‘Physionet: Fantasia database’ [25] and
has been described in [14]. Beat-to-beat
heart rate signals from two groups of healthy
adults: twenty young (age 21-34) and twenty
old (age 68-81) with 10 males and females
in each category, were obtained. The sub-
jects were studied while lying in a supine (ly-
ing on back) position and watching the Dis-
ney movie ‘Fantasia’ to maintain wakefulness.
The ECG data was sampled at 250 Hz and
the obtained samples were used for analysis.
For further details of the experimental setup,
please refer to [14].

In our study, we take short length sam-
ples from random time instances and analyze
them using the three complexity measures
(described in the previous section) to gauge
their eﬃciency in distinguishing between the
two groups of data.

5. Comparative complexity analysis

In this section, we take a closer look at the
performances of each of the measures. We are
interested in ﬁnding out the minimum num-
ber of samples required for correct classiﬁca-
tion.

• Calculate the ApEn, LZ and ETC com-
plexity measures for the chosen L length
data set.

• For statistical accuracy, 50 such loca-
tions are randomly chosen and 50 com-
plexity values for each of the measures
are calculated.

• The complexity assigned to each of the
measure for a sequence of length L is the
average of all the 50 values calculated.

• Thus for each complexity measure, we
obtain 20 complexity values for the
young subjects and 20 complexity values
for the old subjects.

• Using these values as samples represent-
ing the young and old populations, a
two-sample t-test is performed for each
complexity measure.

• The results of the t-test are analyzed to
check if the mean complexity value of
the beat-to-beat interval of the young
subjects is signiﬁcantly greater than the
mean complexity value of the beat-to-
beat interval of the old subjects.

• The entire process is repeated multiple
times with diﬀerent values of L and the
minimum length at which each complex-
ity measure is able to successfully clas-
sify is determined.

5.1. Analysis procedure

5.2. Results summary

• From each of the twenty young and old
data sets, choose consecutive L number
of samples from a random location.

As per the procedure outlined above, com-
plexity measures were calculated for data
of diﬀerent lengths. The continuous valued

6

beat-to-beat interval data was quantized us-
ing using 4 bins and again using 8 bins and
complexity measures were calculated. Two-
sample t-test was performed on the complex-
ity values for various lengths and the results
are shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.

The t-test results for analysis using 4 bins

may be summarized as follows:

• The mean ApEn complexity of the beat-
to-beat interval of old subjects is signif-
icantly less than that of young subjects
for data lengths of 20 (t 30 = -3.29, p =
0.001) and 15 (t 27 = -2.24, p = 0.017)
while it is not signiﬁcantly less (t 38 =
-1.41, p = 0.083) for data length of 10.

• The mean LZ complexity of the beat-to-
beat interval of old subjects is signiﬁ-
cantly less than that of young subjects
for data lengths of 20 (t 30 = -2.76, p =
0.005) and 15 (t 34 = -2.36, p = 0.012)
while it is not signiﬁcantly less (t 38 =
-0.38, p = 0.352) for data length of 10.

• The mean ETC complexity of the beat-
to-beat interval of old subjects is signif-
icantly less than that of young subjects
for a data length of 20 (t 28 = -1.86 p =
0.037), while it is not signiﬁcantly less
for data lengths of 15 (t 27 = -0.87, p =
0.195) and 10 (t 38 = -0.15, p = 0.439).

The t-test results for analysis using 8 bins

may be summarized as follows:

• The mean ApEn complexity of the beat-
to-beat interval of old subjects is sig-
niﬁcantly less (t 27 = -2.24, p = 0.017)

than that of young subjects for a data
length of 15 while it is not signiﬁcantly
less for data lengths of 10 (t 38 = -1.41, p
= 0.083) and 8 (t 38 = -0.26, p = 0.797).

• The mean LZ complexity of the beat-to-
beat interval of old subjects is signiﬁ-
cantly less than that of young subjects
for data lengths of 15 (t 32 = -3.09, p =
0.004) and 10 (t 38 = -2.10, p = 0.043)
while it is not signiﬁcantly less (t 38 =
-1.89, p = 0.067) for a data length of 8.

• The mean ETC complexity of the beat-
to-beat interval of old subjects is signif-
icantly less than that of young subjects
for data lengths of 15 (t 29 = -3.01, p =
0.005) and 10 (t 38 = -2.30, p = 0.027)
while it is not signiﬁcantly less (t 38 =
-1.25, p = 0.217) for a data length of 8.

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the ability of the
complexity measures to classify beat-to-beat
intervals of old and young subjects, using 4
bins and 8 bins respectively.

6. Conclusions and Future Research

Work

Based on our study on the experimental
data, at a 5% signiﬁcance level (overall error
rate) for the statistical test, there is suﬃcient
evidence to conclude that:

• For data analyzed using 4 bins, ApEn
and LZ complexity measures are able to
distinguish between beat-to-beat inter-
vals of young and old subjects for lengths
of 15 or more, while ETC complexity

• For data analyzed using 8 bins, both
LZ and ETC complexity measures are
able to distinguish between beat-to-beat
intervals of young and old subjects for
lengths as short as 10 data samples,
while ApEn is able to do so only for
lengths greater than 15.

For future research work,

it is impera-
tive that we study the eﬀect of noise (which
is unavoidable in real-life applications) and
missing-data on the complexity measures and
how it might impact the discrimination be-
tween cardiac signals of young and old sub-
jects. This could be done by adding diﬀer-
ent levels of noise on the existing data-sets
and also removing parts of data to simulate
missing-data problem. This is also important
from a clinical application perspective.
