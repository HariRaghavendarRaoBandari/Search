Abstract. The dynamics of two ultra-cold bosons conﬁned in a one-dimensional double-well potential is
studied. We compare the exact dynamics governed by a full two-body Hamiltonian with the dynamics
obtained in a two-mode model approximation. We show that for suﬃciently large interactions the two-
mode model breaks down and higher single-particle states have to be taken into account to describe the
dynamical properties of the system correctly.

1 Introduction

Double-well conﬁnement is one of the simplest examples
where quantum dynamics manifests its nonintuitive prop-
erties [1,2]. Already on the single-particle level, the tun-
neling through a classically impenetrable barrier has many
spectacular consequences like electron tunneling through
p-n junctions [3,4,5,6] or the Josephson eﬀect [7]. The
physics of double-well systems becomes even more inter-
esting whenever interactions between particles are consid-
ered.

In view of recent experimental progress with ultra-cold
atoms forming a Bose-Einstein condensate, double-well
systems are one of the most commonly exploited schemes
studied [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, 16,17, 18]. Typically, in this
context one assumes that weakly interacting bosons occu-
pying diﬀerent wells can be described with two indepen-
dent single-particle orbitals and that the dynamics is gov-
erned by two mechanisms: contact two-body interactions
acting locally and single-particle tunneling between wells.
Then, in the mean-ﬁeld limit, a corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii
equation is introduced and numerically solved for diﬀerent
initial conditions [19,20,21]. Generalized two-mode mod-
els, taking into account additional terms originating from
long-range interactions or occupation-dependent tunnel-
ings, are also considered in the literature and relevant cor-
rections to the dynamics are studied [22,23, 24]. Although
the validity of these simpliﬁed two-mode models was con-
ﬁrmed experimentally for weak interactions between parti-
cles, they were extended beyond the range of their applica-
bility and adopted for strongly interacting systems, i.e. in

situations when the local interaction energy is much larger
than the single-particle tunneling energy. For example, it
was shown that for initially imbalanced occupations the
dynamics is heavily aﬀected by strong interactions [25].
Unfortunately, the validity of the model used was not dis-
cussed and its predictions were not compared with the
exact dynamics governed by a general model.

It is quite obvious that for suﬃciently strong interac-
tions between particles any two-mode model has to break
down. This comes from the observation that interactions
always introduce some multi-particle correlations that ex-
ist locally at each site of the potential. Therefore, a sim-
ple assumption that all particles occupying a single site
can be described with a single eﬀective orbital cannot be
valid. The situation is very similar to the problem of ultra-
cold bosons conﬁned in a single harmonic trap. As it was
shown in the case of two strongly interacting bosons in a
harmonic trap, a single-mode description is not valid [26].
In the case studied here, whenever interactions are sig-
niﬁcantly larger than typical tunneling energies between
wells, local correlations induced by interactions are pro-
duced much faster than correlations between wells. Just
from this simple observation it is quite obvious that any
two-mode approximation is inconsistent.

Inspired by this simple observation, in this article we
study the dynamical properties of two bosons conﬁned in
a one-dimensional double-well potential and initially oc-
cupying a chosen site. We numerically compare the exact,
many-body dynamics of the system with the dynamics
governed by simpliﬁed two-mode Hamiltonians. The com-
parison is performed for diﬀerent interaction strengths and
diﬀerent depths of the modeled double-well potential.

J. Dobrzyniecki and T. Sowi´nski: Exact dynamics of two bosons in a double-well potential

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the
single-particle Hamiltonian with a double-well potential
is introduced and its spectral properties are described. In
Section 3 we discuss the full many-body Hamiltonian de-
scribing identical and spinless ultra-cold bosons and we
rewrite it in a two-site multi-orbital Bose-Hubbard form.
Then, in Section 4 we focus on the problem of two bosons
and we explain the simpliﬁcations of the multi-orbital
Hamiltonian commonly used in literature. In Section 5
the main results are presented. We compare the evolution
governed by a general Hamiltonian with those predicted
by simpliﬁed models in diﬀerent regimes of interactions
and double-well depths. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.

2 Double-well model

For clarity, in this article we assume that particles of mass
m are conﬁned in a one-dimensional harmonic potential
with frequency Ω. The double-well conﬁguration is forced
by an additional repulsive gaussian potential with a con-
trolled intensity which is centered in the middle of the
trap. The external potential is modeled by the following
function:

V (x) = ¯hΩ

x2 + λ exp

The dimensionless parameter λ > 0 gives the intensity of
the barrier between double-well sites (See the left panel
in Fig. 1). Depending on λ, the complete spectrum of the
corresponding single-particle Schr¨odinger equation

H0ϕi(x) = Eiϕi(x),

(2)

where H0 = − ¯h2

dx2 + V (x), is found numerically via
an exact diagonalization procedure. The diagonalization
is done in the position representation on a dense grid.
The resulting spectrum as a function of λ is presented
in the right panel of Fig. 1. Obviously, for λ = 0 the
standard spectrum of the harmonic oscillator is obtained.
For increasing λ the single-particle spectrum changes and
a characteristic two-fold quasi-degeneracy between even
and odd eigenstates appears. For double-well problems
it is convenient to introduce another single-particle basis
{φLi(x), φRi(x)} of states localized in a given well. The
basis is constructed directly form the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian (2) as follows:

φLi(x) =

φRi(x) =

Obviously, the states {φσi(x)}, where the index σ = {L, R}
enumerates wells of the potential, are not eigenstates of
the Schr¨odinger equation (2). However, for each state φσi(x)
there is only one oﬀ-diagonal term coupling the state with
the state localized in the other site. The corresponding ma-

the single-particle Hamiltonian (2) as a function of the double-

ures, all the quantities are given in harmonic oscillator units,

i.e., energy in ¯hΩ and position in(cid:112)¯h/mΩ.

3 Many-body Hamiltonian

In the following we consider two ultra-cold bosons con-
ﬁned in the potential V (x) and interacting via short-range
forces modeled with a point-like potential gδ(x−x(cid:48)), where
g is an eﬀective interaction constant related to the s-wave
scattering length. Note that, in contrast to higher dimen-
sions, in the one-dimensional case the Dirac δ function is
a well deﬁned self-adjoint operator and any regularization
is not necessary [27]. Although we consider only two par-
ticles, it is still convenient to work in the formalism of
the second quantization. Therefore, we introduce the ﬁeld
operator ˆΨ (x) annihilating a particle at position x. The
ﬁeld operator fulﬁlls natural bosonic commutation rela-
tions
= 0. In
this language the many-body Hamiltonian of the system
can be written in the form
ˆH =

The standard route to analyze the Hamiltonian (5) is
to decompose the ﬁeld operator ˆΨ (x) in a chosen single-
particle basis. Here we decompose the bosonic ﬁeld in the

The Hamiltonian (7) is completely equivalent to the initial
Hamiltonian (5). To make the notation simpler, in what
follows we also introduce operators of the total number of

In our deﬁnition, the spreading of the basis wave functions
φσi(x) to the neighboring well is automatically taken into
account. Moreover, the deﬁnition used here treats single-
particle superpositions appropriately, i.e. a left/right prob-
ability is calculated directly from the full single-particle
density and not as a sum of partial probabilities.

4 The system studied

To study the dynamical properties of the system we as-
sume that initially two bosons occupy the lowest state of
a chosen (left) site of the double-well potential

It is worth noticing that this kind of state can be prepared
experimentally for a few particles. For example, a similar
state for two distinguishable particles was obtained in re-
cent experiments [28]. Therefore, the problem analyzed
here has not only a theoretical meaning but also may
have some importance in few-body problems considered
recently in the ﬁeld of ultra-cold atomic systems [29, 30].
It is also worth noting that analogous systems were stud-
ied recently with engineered optical waveguide lattices [31,
32].
The initial state |ini(cid:105) is not an eigenstate of the many-
body Hamiltonian (7) and its time evolution is not trivial.
Our aim is to compare the exact dynamics of the state gov-
erned by the full many-body Hamiltonian (7) with the dy-
namics predicted by a simpliﬁed model in a two-mode ap-
proximation, i.e. when the decomposition (6) is cut down
to the two lowest single-particle states, i = 0. In this ap-
proximation the Hamiltonian (7) has the form

and J = J0 deﬁned in (4). Note that in deﬁnitions (12) we
directly exploit the fact that single-particle wave functions
are real functions of positions. The additional interaction-
induced tunneling controlled by the amplitude T depends
directly on the overlap between wave functions localized
in neighboring wells. Therefore, it becomes important for
shallow barriers.

It is also worth noticing that in the model studied,
pair-tunneling and inter-site density-density interaction
terms are controlled by the same parameter V . This is a
direct consequence of the short-range interactions that are
assumed. Therefore, a typical approximation made in this
context (see for example [25]) of neglecting pair-tunneling
without neglecting density-density interactions seems to
be inconsistent.

It is known that in the case of an extended Hubbard
model describing bosons interacting via long-range inter-
actions, additional tunnelings, i.e. pair-tunneling and density-
induced tunneling, may play a crucial role and may lead
to the appearance of exotic quantum many-body phases
in the system [33, 34,35].

The matrix form of the reduced Hamiltonian (13) can be
derived straightforwardly from (14) by setting T = V = 0.
It is worth noticing that from a theoretical point of
view, the latter model (13) is controlled eﬀectively by
only one dimensionless parameter U/J. However, from
experimental side the two parameters U and J are con-
trolled independently, i.e. the single-particle tunneling J
is controlled only by an external potential parameter λ;
the on-site interaction U is controlled by λ and a cou-
pling strength g which can be tuned independently. That
means that in this approximation the same value of the
dimensionless parameter U/J can be obtained for diﬀer-
ent parameters λ by changing the coupling g. Since U/J
is the only parameter in the model, in all these cases the
evolution of the system is the same provided that time is
measured in the units of ¯h/J. Of course for shallow bar-
riers, when the interaction energy is comparable with the
energy gap to higher orbitals, terms neglected in the orig-
inal Hamiltonian start to inﬂuence the dynamics and an
evolution for the same ratio U/J starts to depend on λ.
This would be the sign that the simpliﬁed model breaks
down.

5 The dynamics

To analyze the limitations of the simpliﬁcations of the
Hamiltonian, we study the dynamics governed by Hamil-
tonians (7), (11), and (13) of the system initially prepared
in the state |ini(cid:105). In our numerical approach we ﬁrst di-
agonalize the matrix forms of Hamiltonians in the Fock
basis built from single-particle states (3) and we obtain
two-body eigenstates and their eigenenergies. In the case
of the full multi-orbital Hamiltonian (7) we cut the de-
composition (6) at a suﬃciently large imax (in practice
imax = 30). Then we decompose the initial state |ini(cid:105)
into the eigenstates and we ﬁnd the time-dependent state
of the system |ψ(t)(cid:105). In principle, an exact form of the
state |ψ(t)(cid:105) depends on the approximation assumed.

The simplest quantity that is accessible in experiments
and can be compared for diﬀerent theoretical models is an

expectation value of the site occupation number (cid:104)ψ(t)| ˆNσ|ψ(t)(cid:105).
Since the total number of particles is conserved, in practice
it is suﬃcient to calculate the imbalance of populations
between potential wells

I(t) = (cid:104)ψ(t)| ˆNL − ˆNR|ψ(t)(cid:105).

(15)

In the following, we compare the dynamics of the sys-
tem in two diﬀerent regimes of parameters. To make the
comparison clear we compare two diﬀerent barriers: λ = 3
and λ = 5. In both cases we tune the interaction coupling g
in such a way that the ratio U/J represents three diﬀerent
regimes: soft interactions (U/J = 0.1), intermediate inter-
actions (U/J = 1), and strong interactions (U/J = 12).
With this strategy, a comparison of diﬀerent cases is quite
natural since simpliﬁed Hamiltonian (13) depends only
on the ratio U/J (with J ﬁxing the energy scale) and
therefore it gives exactly the same dynamics for both λ’s
(understood as an evolution of coeﬃcients in the decom-
position of the many-body state in a Fock state basis).
Whereas, in the other cases, there is also an explicit de-
pendence on λ through the other parameters of the Hamil-
tonian, T and V .

In Fig. 2 we show the evolution of imbalance I(t) in
the case of a very deep potential barrier, λ = 5. The solid
red line represents the imbalance of particles predicted
by an exact many-body Hamiltonian (7). The dotted blue
and thin black lines correspond to the simpliﬁed two-mode
models (11) and (13), respectively. In this case, indepen-
dently of the strength of interactions between particles,
both simpliﬁed models recover the exact dynamics appro-
priately. A small phase shift in oscillations is visible only
in the very strong interaction regime. However, the general
behavior of the imbalance is reproduced.

The situation changes signiﬁcantly for a shallow bar-
rier. In Fig. 3 we compare the analogous behavior for
λ = 3. It is seen that only in the case of small interac-
tions is the dynamics well captured by simpliﬁed models.
However, a comparison of the dotted blue and solid red
lines suggests that a full two-mode model (11) works quite
well even for strong interactions and that it can predict
the evolution of the imbalance of occupations in a sat-
isfactory way for long times. Only the small oscillations
around the general behavior are not reproduced correctly
by this model. For example, for U/J = 12, where the sim-
pliﬁed model (13) is completely wrong, the model (11) is
suﬃcient to describe the oscillation of occupation between
diﬀerent wells with almost adequate frequency. The small
discrepancy in the resulting frequency leads only to a slow
growth of the phase shift between curves.

This illusory conviction that a complete two-mode Hamil-

tonian (11) is suﬃcient to describe the dynamical prop-
erties of the system in the strong interaction limit has to
be revisited when, instead of densities, inter-particle cor-
relations are considered. For example, let us consider one
of the simplest correlations – the probability that bosons
occupy diﬀerent wells of the potential. In the case of two
bosons, this probability is related to the density-density

where ˆnσi = ˆa

The time evolution of the probability P(t) may shed
some light on the diﬀerences between evolutions governed
by diﬀerent Hamiltonians in the strong interaction limit.
This comes from the fact that for the simplest case (13),
single-particle tunnelings is strongly suppressed by the
conservation of energy. The energy diﬀerence between the
initial state (10) and a state in which bosons occupy dif-
ferent wells is equal to U , and is much larger than the
energy gain from the tunneling, J. Therefore, the dynam-
ics is governed eﬀectively by the second-order process in
the tunneling, i.e. bosons tunnel between wells mainly in
pairs [37]. This is visible in the evolution of the proba-
bility (16) (black curve in Fig. 4) – it is close to 0 at
all moments. Situation may change for extended models
(11) and (7) where other processes are taken into account.
For example, in the case of the extended two-mode model
(11) the density-induced tunnelings give additional con-
tributions to single-particle tunneling and they eﬀectively
support the breaking of a bosonic pair. On the other hand,
a pair-tunneling term supports an ordinary second-order
tunneling of a composed pair. After all, as it is seen from
numerical results, for strong enough interactions the on-
site energy U always dominates over other terms and the
probability (16) is close to 0 also for the extended two-
mode model (11) (blue line in Fig. 4).

The full many-orbital model (7) opens additional chan-
nels for single-particle tunneling. For strong interactions,
couplings to higher orbitals, in which single-particle tun-
nelings Ji are large, become relevant. Therefore, the break-
ing of a bosonic pair is ampliﬁed. In consequence, particles
can tunnel through the barrier almost independently. This
fact is clearly visible in the evolution of the probability
P(t) (red line in Fig. 4). The probability, initially being
equal to 0, rapidly grows to 1/2 and oscillates around 1/4
during the entire evolution. Consequently, the probability
that two bosons may be found in diﬀerent wells is quite
large and cannot be neglected. Moreover, as was explained
above, this fact is not reproduced correctly by the simpli-
ﬁed models. It is quite natural that for a higher number
of particles the situation can be even more complicated.
Therefore, one should treat all dynamical results obtained
with simpliﬁed models with increased care.

6 Conclusions

In this article, we have studied the dynamical properties
of two ultra-cold bosons conﬁned in a one-dimensional
double-well potential initially occupying the lowest state
of a chosen site. We compare the exact dynamics governed
by a full two-body Hamiltonian with two simpliﬁed two-
mode models. In particular, we compared the evolution
of particle density and spatial correlations between parti-
cles. We show that for a shallow barrier and strong enough

tion of normalized time in the case of a deep potential barrier
(λ = 5). The solid red curve corresponds to the dynamics gov-
erned by a full multi-orbital Hamiltonian (7). The dotted blue
and thin black curves show the simpliﬁed dynamics described
by Hamiltonians (11) and (13), respectively. In all cases we as-
sume that initially the system is prepared in the state |ini(cid:105).
Note that the exact dynamics is well approximated by the re-
duced Hamiltonians independently of the strength of the in-
teractions being considered.

(λ = 3). The solid red curve corresponds to the dynamics gov-
erned by a full multi-orbital Hamiltonian (7). The dotted blue
and thin black curves show the simpliﬁed dynamics described
by Hamiltonians (11) and (13), respectively. In all cases we as-
sume that initially the system is prepared in the state |ini(cid:105). In
contrast to the cases shown in Fig. 2, the exact dynamics can
not be approximated by the most simpliﬁed Hamiltonian (13).
However, comparison of the solid red and dotted blue lines may
suggest that the dynamics of occupations are well captured by
the two-mode Hamiltonian (11). As explained in the main text

Fig. 4. Time evolution of the probability that bosons occupy
diﬀerent wells of the potential in the case of a shallow potential
barrier (λ = 3) and strong interactions (U/J = 12). For sim-
pliﬁed Hamiltonians (11) and (13) (blue and black curves, re-
spectively) the probability is close to 0. In the case of the com-
plete many-orbital Hamiltonian (7) the probability is clearly
nonzero, i.e. it is not so rare to ﬁnd bosons in opposite wells
of the potential.

interactions the simpliﬁed models break down and the cor-
rect multi-orbital description cannot be substituted with a
two-mode model even if all appropriate interaction terms
are taken into account. The fundamental diﬀerence be-
tween the exact and two-mode descriptions emerges when
inter-particle correlations are considered. For example, the
evolution of the probability that both bosons are found in
opposite wells of the potential crucially depends on cou-
plings to higher orbitals of an external potential. This fact
sheds some light on recent theoretical results and opens
some perspectives for further experimental explorations.
