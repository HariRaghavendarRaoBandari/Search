Abstract

We compute masses of D meson, Ds meson and charmonium states using Nf = 2 + 1 + 1
Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD. All results are extrapolated to physical light quark masses,
physical strange and charm quark masses and to the continuum. Our analysis includes states
with spin J = 0, 1, 2, parity P = −, + and in case of charmonium also charge conjugation
C = −, +. Computations are based on a large set of quark-antiquark meson creation operators.
We investigate and quantify all sources of systematic errors, including ﬁtting range uncertainties,
ﬁnite volume eﬀects, isospin breaking eﬀects and the choice of the ﬁtting ansatz for the combined
chiral and continuum extrapolation such that the resulting meson masses can be compared
directly and in a meaningful way to experimental results. Within combined statistical and
systematic errors, which are between below two per mille and three percent, our results agree
with available experimental results for most of the states. In the few cases where we observe
discrepancies, we discuss possible reasons.

Introduction

Quite a number of D meson, Ds meson and charmonium states have been observed in experi-
ments [1]. Several of them are both experimentally and theoretically well-understood, i.e. their
quantum numbers and their structure are known. Examples include, in particular, the pseu-
doscalar ground state mesons D, Ds and ηc(1S) and the vector ground state mesons D∗, D∗
s
and J/ψ(1S). There are, however, open questions regarding some of the more recently found
excitations. Examples are the positive parity mesons D∗
s0(2317) and Ds1(2460), ﬁrst reported
by BaBar [2] and CLEO [3], respectively, which are unexpectedly light compared to expecta-
tions from quark model calculations. This could be an indication that these states are not just
quark-antiquark pairs, but have a more complicated structure, e.g. are composed of two quarks
and two antiquarks, a scenario at the moment neither established nor ruled out. The situation
is similar for some of the charmonium-like X states, e.g. X(3872) ﬁrst observed by Belle [4].

There are many interesting approaches to study D mesons, Ds mesons and charmonium states
theoretically, e.g. quark models [5], eﬀective theories respecting QCD symmetries [6] or Dyson-
Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations [7], to just name a few. Of course, it would be highly
desirable to understand these mesons and their properties starting from ﬁrst principles, i.e. the
QCD Lagrangian, without any assumptions, model simpliﬁcations or truncations. The corre-
sponding method is lattice QCD, a numerical technique to compute QCD observables, which
allows to investigate and quantify all sources of systematic error. Computing the spectrum and
investigating the structure of mesons using lattice QCD is, however, a challenging task. Sev-
eral problems have only partly been solved or require investing a rather large amount of high
performance computing resources, for example simulations with physically light u/d quarks.
Similarly, to remove discretization errors, one has to study the continuum limit, which necessi-
tates time consuming simulations at several diﬀerent lattice spacings. Particularly problematic
is the investigation of mesons, which readily decay into lighter multi-particle states. Such states
should theoretically be treated as resonances and not as stable quark-antiquark states, which is
technically extremely diﬃcult, even for simple cases, where only a single decay channel exists.

Examples are D∗
ilarly, it is very challenging to study mesons which might have a structure more complicated
than a simple quark-antiquark pair, e.g. candidates for tetraquarks or hybrid mesons. While
there has been a lot of impressive progress regarding lattice QCD hadron spectroscopy within
the last couple of years, there is certainly still a lot of room for improvement. Simple states, in
particular pseudoscalar and vector ground state mesons, have, meanwhile, been studied very ac-
curately, including simulations at or extrapolations to physically light u/d quark masses and the
continuum limit. On the other hand, the majority of studies concerned with parity, radial and
orbital excitations are still at a more exploratory stage, i.e. have quite often been performed at
unphysically heavy quark masses or at a single ﬁnite lattice spacing. Recent reviews discussing
the status of lattice QCD computations of D and Ds mesons and of charmonium are Refs. [8]
and [9, 10], respectively.

The most common approach to compute meson masses using lattice QCD is to employ meson
creation operators, which are composed of a quark and an antiquark, and to extract meson
masses from the exponential decay of corresponding correlation functions1. This strategy yields
accurate and solid results for mesons which resemble quark-antiquark pairs and which are quite

stable, i.e. many of the low-lying states in the D meson, Ds meson and charmonium sector.
Recent lattice QCD papers following this strategy to compute masses and spectra of D and Ds
mesons and of charmonium are Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].
Rigorous treatments of more complicated mesonic systems like the previously mentioned unstable
D∗
s0(2317) and Ds1(2460), require
more advanced techniques, including the implementation of meson creation operators composed
of two quarks and two antiquarks and possibly studies of the volume dependence of the masses
of corresponding scattering states2. Examples of recent lattice QCD papers exploring and using
such techniques to study speciﬁc D, Ds or charmonium states are Refs. [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37].

The goal of this paper is to compute the masses of several low-lying D meson, Ds meson
and charmonium states using Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD with 2+1+1 dynamical quark
ﬂavors. One of the main advantages of this particular discretization of QCD is automatic O(a)
improvement, i.e. discretization errors appear only quadratically in the small lattice spacing
a and are, hence, strongly suppressed. From a technical point of view, we employ a large
variety of quark-antiquark meson creation operators and are, hence, able to address total angular
momentum J = 0, 1, 2, parity P = −, + and in case of charmonium charge conjugation C = −, +.
Computations have been performed for ten diﬀerent gauge link ensembles with unphysically
heavy u/d quark masses corresponding to pion masses mπ ≈ 225 . . . 470 MeV and with lattice
spacings a ≈ 0.0619 fm , 0.0815 fm , 0.0885 fm. Moreover, each meson mass has been computed
twice using two diﬀerent valence Wilson twisted mass quark discretizations. This rather large
amount of lattice data allows solid extrapolations both to physically light u/d quark masses
and to the continuum. Moreover, ﬁnite volume eﬀects have been investigated and found to be
negligible.

As mentioned above, some D meson, Ds meson and charmonium states are quite unstable or
might have a structure signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from a quark-antiquark pair. Even though we
present results for these states in this work, a rigorous treatment will require more advanced
techniques, in particular the inclusion of four-quark creation operators as discussed above. We
are in the process of developing such techniques using a similar lattice QCD setup [38, 39, 40].
The techniques and results presented in this paper are an important prerequisite for such more
advanced computations.

Parts of this work have been presented at recent conferences [41, 42, 43, 44] and certain technical
aspects are discussed in detail in Ref. [45].

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the 2+1+1 ﬂavor Wilson twisted
mass lattice QCD setup and the meson creation operators we use. We also explain in detail
how we tune the strange and charm quark masses, and how we extrapolate the meson masses
to physically light u/d quark masses and to the continuum. In Section 3, we present our results
for D and Ds mesons and for charmonium states and discuss and quantify all possible error
sources. These results are summarized in plots and tables in Section 4, where we also give a
brief outlook.

2 Computational setup

In the following, we summarize our lattice QCD setup and the technical steps by which we
determine masses of D mesons, of Ds mesons and of charmonium states. For further details, we
refer to Ref. [45], where some aspects have already been discussed extensively.

2.1 Gauge link ensembles, sea quarks, valence quarks

We use gauge link conﬁgurations generated with 2+1+1 dynamical quark ﬂavors by the Euro-
pean Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) [46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. The gluonic action is the Iwasaki
gauge action [51]. For the light degenerate (u, d) quark doublet, the standard Wilson twisted
mass action

Slight[χ(l), ¯χ(l), U ] = Xx

¯χ(l)(x)(cid:16)DW(m0) + iµγ5τ3(cid:17)χ(l)(x)

(1)

has been used [52], for the heavy (c, s) sea quark doublet, the Wilson twisted mass formulation
for non-degenerate quarks

Sheavy[χ(h), ¯χ(h), U ] = Xx

¯χ(h)(x)(cid:16)DW(m0) + iµσγ5τ1 + µδτ3(cid:17)χ(h)(x)

[53]. DW denotes the Wilson Dirac operator,

DW(m0) =

χ(l) = (χ(u), χ(d)) and χ(h) = (χ(c), χ(s)) are the quark ﬁelds in the so-called twisted basis and τ1
and τ3 denote the ﬁrst and third Pauli matrix acting in ﬂavor space. At maximal twist, physical
quantities, e.g. meson masses, are automatically O(a) improved [54, 55, 56, 57]. The tuning has
been done by adjusting m0 such that the PCAC quark mass in the light quark sector vanishes
(cf. [49] for details). For a review on Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD, we refer to Ref. [58].

In this work, we use ten ensembles, which diﬀer in the light u/d quark mass (corresponding pion
masses 225 MeV <
∼ 0.0885 fm and the spacetime
volume (scale setting via the pion mass and the pion decay constant [59]). The s and the c quark
masses are represented by µσ and µδ. These values have been chosen such that the lattice QCD
results for 2m2
π and for mD, quantities which depend only weakly on the light u/d quark
mass, are close to the corresponding physical values [49, 60, 61]. Details of these gauge link
ensembles are collected in Table 1. Ensemble A40.24 is not used to generate ﬁnal results for
meson masses, but only to conﬁrm the absence of ﬁnite volume eﬀects (cf. Section 3.4.1).

For the light degenerate (u, d) valence quark doublet, we use the same action which was used to
simulate the corresponding sea quarks, i.e. the action (1).

For the heavy s and c valence quarks, we use twisted mass doublets of degenerate quarks, i.e.
a diﬀerent discretization than for the corresponding sea quarks. We use the action (1) with the
replacements χ(l) → χ(s) = (χ(s+), χ(s−)), µ → µs and χ(l) → χ(c) = (χ(c+), χ(c−)), µ → µc, re-
spectively. We do this to avoid mixing of strange and charm quarks, which inevitably takes place

in a unitary non-degenerate Wilson twisted mass setup, and which is particularly problematic for
observables containing charm quarks, e.g. masses of D and Ds mesons and of charmonium (cf.
[60, 61] for a detailed discussion of these problems). These degenerate valence doublets allow two
realizations for strange as well as for charm quarks, either with a twisted mass term +iµs,cγ5 (i.e.
χ(s+) or χ(c+)) or −iµs,cγ5 (i.e. χ(s−) or χ(c−)). For a quark-antiquark meson creation operator,
e.g. ¯χ(1)γ5χ(2), the sign combinations (+,−) and (−, +) for the antiquark ¯χ(1) and the quark
χ(2) are related by symmetry, i.e. the corresponding correlation functions are identical. These
correlation functions diﬀer, however, from their counterparts with sign combinations (+, +) and
(−,−) due to diﬀerent discretization errors. We have performed computations for both types
of sign combinations and refer to them as (+,−) ≡ (±,∓) discretization and (+, +) ≡ (±,±)
discretization, respectively (cf. the following subsection for details).

2.2 Meson creation operators and trial states

In the continuum, a quark-antiquark operator creating a meson trial state with deﬁnite quantum
numbers J PC (total angular momentum J, parity P, charge conjugation C), when applied to the
vacuum |Ωi, is

Ophysical
Γ, ¯ψ(1)ψ(2) ≡
(1/√V )R d3r projects to vanishing total momentum (V is the spatial volume), i.e. realizes a
meson at rest. R|∆r|=R d3∆r denotes an integration over a sphere of radius R, which is the

distance between the antiquark and the quark. Γ(∆r) is a suitable combination of spherical
harmonics and γ matrices (cf. Table 2, column “Γ(n), pb”), which determines total angular
momentum J, parity P and, in case of identical quark ﬂavors, charge conjugation C. U (r; r+∆r)
is a straight gluonic parallel transporter connecting the antiquark and the quark in a gauge
invariant way. For D mesons, e.g. ¯ψ(1)ψ(2) = ¯uc, for Ds mesons, e.g. ¯ψ(1)ψ(2) = ¯sc and for
charmonium, ¯ψ(1)ψ(2) = ¯cc.

where the integration over a sphere with center at r has been replaced by the sum over the
six neighboring lattice sites of n and U (n; n + ∆n) denotes the link between n and n + ∆n.
Moreover, physical basis quark operators ¯ψ(1), ψ(2) have been replaced by their twisted basis
counterparts ¯χ(1), χ(2).

In the continuum, the relation between the physical and the twisted basis is given by the twist
rotation,

,

(6)

¯ψ(f ) = ¯χ(f ) exp(cid:16)iγ5τ3ω/2(cid:17)

ψ(f ) = exp(cid:16)iγ5τ3ω/2(cid:17)χ(f )
with the twist angle ω, where ω = π/2 at maximal twist. χ(f ) denotes either the light
doublet χ(l) = (χ(u), χ(d)), the strange doublet χ(s) = (χ(s+), χ(s−)) or the charm doublet
χ(c) = (χ(c+), χ(c−)).
When transforming a twisted basis quark bilinear ¯χ(1)Γχ(2) as e.g. appearing in (5) to the
physical basis or vice versa, the result depends not only on Γ, but also on the ﬂavor combination,
i.e. whether ¯χ(1) and χ(2) are upper components (twisted mass term +iµγ5) or lower components
(twisted mass term −iµγ5) of twisted basis doublets.
In the columns “tb, (±,∓)” and “tb,
(±,±)” of Table 2, we list for all ﬂavor combinations (+ and − denote the signs in front of the
twisted mass terms for ¯χ(1) and χ(2)) and all Γ combinations of our meson creation operators,
how physical and twisted basis are related. “pb” indicates that the twisted basis Γ is the same
as the physical basis Γ, while “±iγ5×” denotes that the physical basis Γ has to be multiplied
from the left with ±iγ5 to obtain the corresponding twisted Γ.
Isospin I and parity P are symmetries of QCD. While in Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD the
z component of isospin Iz is still a quantum number, I and P are broken by O(a) due to the
Wilson term − ¯χ(f )(a/2)∇∗

For D mesons, we use trial states Otwisted

combinations with identical signs in front of the twisted mass terms ((+, +) discretization),

¯χ(u)χ(c+)

, ¯χ(d)χ(c−)

, ¯χ(c+)χ(u)

, ¯χ(c−)χ(d)

(8)

also yield identical correlation functions. At ﬁnite lattice spacing, (+,−) and (+, +) correlation
functions slightly diﬀer due to discretization errors. As a consequence, D meson masses com-
puted on the one hand with a (+, +) and on the other hand with a (+,−) ﬂavor combination,
but which are otherwise identical, will diﬀer in mass. Due to automatic O(a) improvement of

6

Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD at maximal twist, this mass splitting will be proportional to
a2, i.e. is expected to be rather small and will vanish quadratically when approaching the contin-
uum limit. This theoretical expectation is conﬁrmed by our numerical results shown in Section
3. We use both (+,−) results and (+, +) results when performing continuum extrapolations.
Note that parity is not a symmetry, i.e. there is no rigorous separation between P = + and
P = − states in Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD. Nevertheless, it is possible to assign parity
quantum numbers to the extracted meson masses in a clean and unambigous way (cf. [45],
Section 4.2 for a detailed numerical example).
Identical considerations apply for Ds mesons, when replacing (u, d) → (s+, s−).
For charmonium creation operators, there are two appropriate ﬂavor combinations,

¯χ(c+)χ(c+)

, ¯χ(c−)χ(c−),

(9)

which are again related by symmetry. Since we ignore disconnected contributions to correlation
functions throughout this work, we can also consider ﬂavor combinations with opposite signs in
front of the twisted mass terms,

¯χ(c+)χ(c−)

, ¯χ(c−)χ(c+).

(10)

On a cubic lattice, rotational symmetry is reduced to symmetry with respect to cubic rotations.
There are only ﬁve diﬀerent irreducible representations of the cubic group O (labeled by A1,
T1, E, T2, A2). For our creation operators, we list the corresponding representations for spin,
orbital angular momentum and total angular momentum in Table 2, column “OS ⊗ OL → OJ ”.
Assignment of continuum angular momentum J to our resulting meson masses is discussed in
Section 3.

To enhance the overlap of trial states Otwisted
Γ, ¯χ(1)χ(2)|Ωi to low lying meson states, we use standard
smearing techniques. This allows to read oﬀ meson masses from the exponential decay of correla-
tion functions at rather small temporal separations, where the signal-to-noise ratio is favorable.
Smearing is done in two steps. First, we replace spatial gauge links by their APE smeared
counterparts [62]. Then, we use Gaussian smearing on the quark ﬁelds χ(l), χ(s) and χ(c), which
resorts to the APE smeared spatial links. The parameters we have chosen are NAPE = 10,
αAPE = 0.5, NGauss = 30, 36, 65 (for A, B and D ensembles, respectively) and κGauss = 0.5. This
corresponds to a Gaussian width of the smeared quark ﬁelds of approximately 0.24 fm. Cf. Ref.
[63] for detailed equations.

j and k label the rows and columns of these correlation matrices or, equivalently, are indices

S(. . .) indicates that APE smeared gauge links and Gaussian smeared quark ﬁelds are used for
the meson creation operators (cf. the discussion in Section 2.2). For the computations, we use
a generalization of the one-end trick, which is explained in detail in Ref. [45]. Since parity is
only an approximate symmetry in twisted mass lattice QCD, we consider correlation matrices
of meson creation operators with both P = + and P = −.
In Table 1, we list for each ensemble the number of gauge link conﬁgurations used for the
computation of the correlation matrices CΓj ;Γk; ¯χ(1)χ(2). The four stochastic sources needed for
the one-end trick are located on a timeslice, which is randomly chosen for every gauge link
conﬁguration. We use a single set of four stochastic timeslice sources, i.e. a single sample for
each gauge link conﬁguration.

We determine meson masses from the correlation matrices CΓj ;Γk; ¯χ(1)χ(2) by solving standard
generalized eigenvalue problems (cf. e.g. Ref. [64] and references therein). From the resulting
eigenvalues, we obtain the masses, while the resulting eigenvectors provide information about the
operator content, from which one can read oﬀ the parity quantum number as well as information
regarding the structure of the meson (e.g. which spin or orbital angular momentum is dominant).
For a detailed discussion, we refer to Ref. [45], Section 4.2.

2.3.2 Tuning s and c valence quark masses to their physical values

K − m2

We tune the s and c valence quark masses via 2m2
π (which does not depend on the u/d
quark mass at leading order of chiral perturbation theory) and mD (which does only weakly
depend of the u/d quark mass). For that purpose, we use experimental results for the masses
of the electrically neutral mesons π0, K 0 and D0 in the case of neutral charm-light and charm-
charm mesons, whereas for the charged charm-light and charm-strange mesons, we instead use
the electrically charged mesons π±, K ± and D±. The idea behind this choice is that for neutral
(charged) mesons, the electrical charges are opposite (combine to ±1) both for the input meson
masses used for quark mass tuning as well as for all the meson masses predicted by our lattice
QCD computation. Even though electromagnetism is not part of our lattice setup, we expect that
by using this procedure, electromagnetic eﬀects are to a sizable extent incorporated in the quark
mass tuning. As we will discuss in Section 3, when analyzing our results, this procedure seems
to work very well, i.e. for states, which can be computed with small statistical errors of <
∼ 5 MeV
(e.g. the Ds meson, ηc(1S) and J/ψ(1S)), we obtain perfect agreement with experimental results.
On the other hand, when performing the tuning in the non-ideal opposite way, e.g. using neutral
mesons for quark mass tuning to predict the Ds meson mass, the lattice result diﬀers from
its experimental counterpart by ≈ 5 MeV, which is the typical order of magnitude of isospin
breaking eﬀects in meson masses.

We also note that to compute 2m2
π and mD for the s and c valence quark mass tuning,
we always use the (+,−) discretization, which is known to yield smaller discretization errors for

K − m2

8

these pseudoscalar mesons4 [65, 66].

The technical aspects of the tuning procedure are explained in more detail in Ref. [45]. For
each ensemble (characterized by a and mπ ≡ m(+,−)
), we perform computations of mK for two
valence s quark masses µs,1 and µs,2, diﬀerent by around 10% and both in the region of the
physical s quark mass. The physical valence s quark mass can then be determined according to

µc,2, the black dots to µs,phys and µc,phys). For this speciﬁc case, we also performed computations
for a third s and c valence quark mass, µs,3 and µc,3 (represented by the blue points in Figure 1).
This shows that the linear dependence of 2(m(+,−)

in (12) and (13), respectively, is well satisﬁed for our numerical data with only a tiny deviation

µc,1(a, mπ) − µc,2(a, mπ)

4Moreover, the calculation of the pion mass using the (+, +) discretization requires the computation of discon-
nected diagrams, which would lead to signiﬁcantly larger statistical errors and hence less precise s and c valence
quark mass tuning.

2.3.3 Extrapolating meson masses to physically light u/d quark masses and to the

continuum

We use the procedure described in the previous subsection to compute meson masses for nine
of the ten ensembles listed in Table 1 using both the (+,−) and the (+, +) valence quark
discretization (ensemble A40.24 is only used to exclude ﬁnite volume eﬀects; cf. Section 3.4.1).
Then, we extrapolate these meson masses to physically light u/d quark masses (for simplicity,
also denoted as the chiral extrapolation in the following) and to the continuum. For each meson
state, we perform an independent ﬁt to the corresponding 18 lattice QCD masses m(+,±)(a, mπ)
(nine ensembles characterized by a and mπ, two discretizations (+,−) and (+, +)).
Our most general ﬁtting ansatz is ﬁrst order in a2 (discretization errors proportional to a are
excluded due to automatic O(a) improvement of Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD) and linear
in m2

π (typically the leading order in chiral perturbation theory):

m(+,−)(a, mπ) ≡ m(+,−) + c(+,−)a2 + α(+,−)(cid:16)m2
m(+,+)(a, mπ) ≡ m(+,+) + c(+,+)a2 + α(+,+)(cid:16)m2
where m(+,−), m(+,+), c(+,−), c(+,+), α(+,−) and α(+,+) are ﬁtting parameters and mπ0,exp ≈
135 MeV 5. We adopt three slightly diﬀerent strategies to obtain and cross-check u/d quark
mass and continuum extrapolated results for meson masses.

• Strategy 1

We take m(+,−), m(+,+), c(+,−), c(+,+), α(+,−) and α(+,+) as six independent ﬁtting pa-
rameters. In this case, the ﬁts of (16) to (+,−) lattice QCD results and of (17) to (+, +)
5For both the neutral and charged meson masses, we extrapolate to the mass of the neutral pion. The diﬀerence
in meson masses if the charged pion mass is taken for extrapolating to the physical light quark mass is negligible
with respect to the total error, in contrast to the eﬀect of taking neutral/charged π, K and D meson masses for
the s and c quark masses tuning described in Section 2.3.2.

10

lattice QCD results decouple and we obtain for each meson mass two independent es-
timates m(+,−) and m(+,+), respectively. Since these estimates correspond to diﬀerent
discretizations, this strategy allows to test their universality (m(+,−) and m(+,+) should
coincide).

• Strategy 2

Alternatively, we can take this universality as granted and set m(+,−) ≡ m(+,+) ≡ m,
leaving ﬁve ﬁtting parameters, m, c(+,−), c(+,+), α(+,−) and α(+,+). This allows to perform
a single combined u/d quark mass and continuum extrapolation using both discretizations
simultaneously.

• Strategy 3

π0,exp)).

We can additionally assume that the slope of the chiral extrapolation is discretization
independent, i.e. set α(+,−) = α(+,+) ≡ α and perform ﬁts with four ﬁtting parameters,
m, c(+,−), c(+,+) and α. This assumption seems reasonable, because any discretization
dependence of the u/d quark mass dependence is expected to be of higher order, i.e.
O(a2(m2

π − m2

In the following, our preferred ﬁtting strategy is Strategy 2 and all results presented in the
following have been generated accordingly. Note, however, that we have cross-checked these
results by also using the other two strategies, thereby conﬁrming universality of our two valence
quark discretizations as well as discretization independence of the u/d quark mass dependence
(see Section 3.4.2 for more details).

2.3.4 Determination of statistical and systematic errors

The input meson masses m(+,±)(a, mπ, µs, µc) for the quark mass and continuum extrapolations
are extracted from correlation matrices (11) by solving generalized eigenvalue problems, as
discussed in Section 2.3.1. For each meson mass m(+,±)(a, mπ, µs, µc), one needs to decide for
a temporal ﬁtting interval, where a constant (representing m(+,±)(a, mπ, µs, µc)) is ﬁtted to
the corresponding eﬀective mass. Therefore, the obtained input meson masses as well as the
subsequently generated extrapolations depend to some extent on the chosen ﬁtting intervals. To
arrive at results which are quite independent of a possibly somewhat arbitrary single speciﬁc
choice of such ﬁtting intervals, we adopt a systematic procedure. This procedure combines
results obtained by choosing a variety of ﬁtting intervals and provides an estimate of the related
uncertainty by taking the spread of these results into account.

Our procedure is applied independently to each meson state. It consists of the following steps:

1. For each ensemble, each valence quark discretization and each s and c valence quark mass,
i.e. for each meson mass m(+,±)(a, mπ, µs, µc), choose the minimal Euclidean time for
extracting the meson mass from the corresponding eﬀective mass, tmin(a, mπ, µs, µc)/a, as
the smallest t/a for which a ﬁt in the interval [t/a, t/a + 2] yields a χ2/dof ≤ 1.3. (This
we take as an indication that the contamination by excited states is of the same order of
magnitude or smaller than statistical errors.)

2. For each ensemble, each valence quark discretization and each s and c valence quark mass,
i.e. for each meson mass m(+,±)(a, mπ, µs, µc), choose the maximal time for extracting the

11

meson mass from the corresponding eﬀective mass, tmax(a, mπ, µs, µc)/a, as the largest t/a
for which the statistical error of the eﬀective mass is still smaller than ﬁve times the error
of the eﬀective mass at time tmin(a, mπ, µs, µc)/a. (In this way data points with rather
large statistical errors, which usually do not contain any useful information, are excluded.)

3. Given tmin(a, mπ, µs, µc)/a and tmax(a, mπ, µs, µc)/a, generate 13 sets of input meson
masses m(+,±)(a, mπ, µs, µc) obtained from ﬁtting intervals (with minimal length of three
timeslices)

n = 0, . . . , 12 (we will later refer to this as the shift parameter), and perform the cor-
responding 13 quark mass and continuum extrapolations as explained in Section 2.3.2
and Section 2.3.3. These resulting input meson masses are denoted by mn. For conve-
nience, we also deﬁne ˜mn, which are the same values, but sorted in ascending order, i.e.
{m0, m1, . . . , m12} = { ˜m0, ˜m1, . . . , ˜m12} and ˜m0 < ˜m1 < . . . < ˜m12.

4. From the set of 13 resulting u/d, s and c quark mass and continuum extrapolated meson
masses { ˜m0, ˜m1, . . . , ˜m12}, we discard the two smallest and the two largest outliers, i.e.
˜m0, ˜m1, ˜m11 and ˜m12. The 9 remaining estimates ˜m2 < ˜m3 < . . . < ˜m10 cover roughly a
1 σ region assuming a Gaussian distribution (9/13 ≈ 69%).

5. The ﬁnal result for the meson mass is generated from { ˜m2, ˜m3, . . . , ˜m10} as follows:

• Central value m:

m is that ˜mn ∈ { ˜m2, ˜m3, . . . , ˜m10} which is the closest to ( ˜m10 + ˜m2)/2, i.e. closest
to the mean of the largest and the smallest ˜mn.

• Statistical uncertainty ∆mstat:

∆mstat is the statistical error associated with that ˜mn taken as the central value m
6.

• Systematic uncertainty ∆msyst:

∆msyst = max(|m − ˜m2| , |m − ˜m10|),
i.e. the larger of the two usually roughly
equal diﬀerences between the central value and the largest and the smallest value
in { ˜m2, ˜m3, . . . , ˜m10}, respectively.

This procedure, in particular step 4 and step 5, is illustrated in Figure 2 for four mesons, ηc(1S),
Ds, ηc(2S) and D∗
s2(2573), ordered ascendingly according to ∆msyst/∆mstat (i.e. straightfor-
ward cases with very clear eﬀective mass plateaus ﬁrst, more delicate cases last). The ratio
∆msyst/∆mstat assumes values roughly between 0.2 and 3.0, which clearly shows that for some
states, the statistical uncertainty dominates, while for other states, the systematic uncertainty
is dominant. Each of the plots shows the 13 estimates mn (generated with Strategy 2). The
four outliers, which are removed in step 4, are colored blue. That mn taken as the central value
m and deﬁning the statistical error ∆mstat is colored black. All remaining mn are colored red.

6The statistical errors of all estimates mn are determined via evolved jackknife analyses starting at the level
of the correlation matrices (11). To exclude statistical correlations between gauge link conﬁgurations which are
close in Monte Carlo simulation time, we performed a suitable binning of these conﬁgurations.

Figure 2:
Illustration of our procedure to determine the systematic uncertainty. Each plot
shows the 13 estimates mn (generated with Strategy 2). The four outliers, which are removed
in step 4, are colored blue. That mn taken as the central value m and deﬁning the statistical
error ∆mstat is colored black. All remaining mn are colored red. The resulting systematic
uncertainty is represented by dashed black lines. (top): ηc(1S) and Ds, cases, where the ﬁtting
range uncertainty is smaller than the statistical error (the vertical scale in both plots is the
same for better comparison). (bottom): ηc(2S) and D∗
s2(2573), cases, where the ﬁtting range
uncertainty is larger than the statistical error (the vertical scale in both plots is the same for
better comparison).

In the case of ηc(1S), the extracted estimates mn are essentially independent of the choice of
the ﬁtting range for eﬀective mass plateaus. Consequently, the systematic uncertainty is small
and the total error is close to the statistical error, which is nearly the same for all 13 plateau
choices. Hence, our procedure generates essentially the same result as one would obtain by a
less evolved analysis of choosing a single speciﬁc eﬀective mass plateau.

In the case of D∗
s2(2573), the situation is rather opposite. The choice of the eﬀective mass
plateau has strong inﬂuence on the resulting meson mass, i.e. the extracted estimates mn diﬀer
within statistical errors by a few σ. Correspondingly, our systematic procedure generates a
rather large systematic uncertainty, which represents the spread of the estimates mn. This
systematic uncertainty is signiﬁcantly larger than any of the statistical errors of the mn and,
hence, dominates the total error. For such cases, we consider our systematic procedure more
conservative and the corresponding results hence superior compared to results obtained by just
deciding for a single speciﬁc ﬁtting interval for each eﬀective mass. Note, however, that if the
meson mass systematically drops down when the ﬁt starts at larger Euclidean times, as for

13

D∗
s2(2573), the resulting ﬁtting range uncertainty may still be underestimated. In such case, the
proper identiﬁcation of this systematic error would require going to even larger t/a, which is
impossible due to the strongly decreasing signal-to-noise ratio at large t/a. In our discussion of
speciﬁc states in Section 3, we will always emphasize this whenever this is the case.

3 Results

In this section, we discuss our results, in particular the chiral and continuum extrapolations for
the meson masses considered in this work. We begin with some general remarks valid for all
states.

For each state, we provide a plot showing all 18 data points corresponding to nine of the ten
ensembles listed in Table 1 and the two diﬀerent discretizations of valence quarks, (+,−) and
(+, +). Each such plot shows data from ﬁtting intervals corresponding to the central value
according to our systematic procedure (cf. Section 2.3.4), e.g. the black points and error bars
in Figure 2. The straight lines in every plot are ﬁts of equations (16) and (17). We remark that
the 18 meson masses at a ﬁxed lattice spacing and pion mass are plotted only with statistical
errors. Hence, in cases when the systematic error dominates over the statistical one, the χ2/dof
can be signiﬁcantly larger than 1. However, when the systematic error is taken into account
in the deﬁnition of the χ2 function, we always obtain values of χ2/dof indicating good ﬁts, i.e.
χ2/dof ≈ 1.
The obtained continuum result at the physical pion mass is compared to the experimental value
given in the latest PDG review [1], with updates from the online version of PDG, available under
http://pdglive.lbl.gov.

The correlation matrices, in particular their size and operator content, is the same as in Ref.
[45] (see Sections 4 and 5 of this reference for details).

3.1 D mesons

We start with mesons containing a charm quark and a light quark, i.e. with D mesons. The plots
refer to our computations of neutral D mesons, which diﬀer from their charged counterparts only
in the strange and charm quark masses tuning (cf. Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3). Plots for charged
D mesons are qualitatively identical and hence not shown. The ﬁnal results for both cases are
collected in Table 5. Note that our estimates of electromagnetic eﬀects and eﬀects from diﬀerent
u and d quark masses are very crude (for a more detailed discussion, cf. Section 2.3.2 and 3.4.3).

3.1.1 A1 representation (spin J = 0)

The ground state corresponds to the D meson (J P = 0−) and the ﬁrst excited state to the
0 meson (J P = 0+). As mentioned above, these states have to be extracted from a single
D∗
correlation matrix due to twisted mass parity breaking – even though these states are in diﬀerent
channels in the continuum (diﬀerent parity), they belong to the same sector in twisted mass
lattice QCD. The A1 representation corresponds to continuum spins J = 0, 4, . . ., but the J = 4
and higher states are expected to be much heavier than the J = 0 ones. Hence, it should be

appropriate to assume that these low-lying states have J = 0.
The mass of the D meson computed with the (+,−) discretization is used for the tuning of the
charm quark. Hence, for this case we only perform a combined chiral and continuum extrapo-
lation using the (+, +) discretization (see Figure 3). We ﬁnd a result compatible with the PDG
value, which conﬁrms that the (+, +) discretization indeed yields the same continuum results,
as guaranteed by universality (see also Section 3.4.2 for a more systematic comparison of results
obtained from both discretizations independently). Of course, when using the experimental
charged π, K and D meson masses for the tuning of the strange and charm quark, our (+, +)
result is consistent with the PDG mass of the charged D meson, as expected.

0 meson (with J P = 0+). The eigenvectors
The ﬁrst excitation (Figure 4) in this sector is the D∗
resulting from the generalized eigenvalue problem provide information about the structure of the
D∗
0. They suggest that it is a roughly equal mixture of four Γ structures (Γ = 1, γ0, γjnj, γ0γjnj),
leading to the conclusion that this meson is a roughly equal superposition of S and P waves.
This is interesting, because in quark model calculations this state is often considered to be a pure
P wave state. Our continuum value of the D∗
0 meson mass is compatible with the experimental
value. However, the behavior with changing light quark mass is somewhat untypical – the meson
mass increases signiﬁcantly with increasing light quark mass for A and B ensembles, whereas
this dependence is reversed for D ensembles. This might be related to the fact that this state
can decay to a D meson and a pion and has a rather large width of Γ = 267(40) MeV. In other
words, the state that we extract may contain a two-meson contribution with the same quantum
numbers, D + π, where the presence of the pion could be the reason for the dependence on

the light quark mass. Therefore, this state may require a more sophisticated lattice treatment,
taking the possibility of such a decay explicitly into account, as explored e.g. in Ref. [29].

3.1.2 T1 representation (spin J = 1)

The T1 representation corresponds to continuum spins J = 1, 3, 4, . . . and again it seems rea-
sonable to assume that the low-lying states that we extract are all J = 1 states. Note that the
J = 3 states appear also in the T2 representation and ﬁnding a state at a similar mass in both
T1 and T2 is hence an indication that it is J = 3. On the other hand, T1 representation states
with no counterpart in the T2 representation are most likely J = 1.
The lowest T1 charm-light state is the D∗ meson (J P = 1−), see Figure 5. The D∗ meson can not
decay to D + π at our values of the pion mass, hence our computation should not be aﬀected by
two-meson contributions with the same quantum numbers. The value we get is slightly above the
PDG result when only the statistical error is taken into account. However, after considering the
ﬁtting range uncertainty, we get agreement with experiment within the total error (represented
by orange boxes in our plots).

For the two lowest excitations in this channel, both with J P = 1+, we again use the eigenvector
components obtained from the generalized eigenvalue problem to resolve the structure. This
is particularly important for these states, since their experimental masses are very close and
hence the assignment of lattice results to the two states characterized by the spin of the light
degrees of freedom j ≈ 1/2 and j ≈ 3/2 is not straightforward. Nevertheless, it can be done in
an unambiguous way, which we described in detail in Ref. [45], Section 5.1.2. According to the

arguments presented there, the D1(2430) has j ≈ 1/2, while the D1(2420) has j ≈ 3/2. This
implies that only the former can decay via an S wave (to D∗ + π) and our lattice treatment
of this state in terms of quark-antiquark operators may again be too simple. On the other
hand, the latter is protected by angular momentum j ≈ 3/2 and hence this decay is strongly
suppressed. Our combined chiral and continuum extrapolation is, however, in good agreement
with the experimental value for D1(2430) (Figure 6), while for D1(2420) (Figure 7), we obtain
a result which is almost 4 σ away, even after considering the uncertainty from the ﬁtting range.
It is interesting to note that j ≈ 3/2 static-light mesons came out too heavy using a similar
lattice QCD setup, with a similar discrepancy with respect to the experimental result [67].
Hence, it is not too surprising that also in the present computation, we encounter the same
problem. A possible explanation of this fact is that the creation operator used to to extract
the meson might not generate a trial state similar enough to the D1(2420). In practice, this
would lead to a contamination of the considered correlation function with higher excited states.
Thus, one would need to go to later Euclidean times to disentangle the D1(2420) from the next
excited state. Indeed, this explanation is favoured by our present data, since the meson mass
decreases when it is extracted from plateau ﬁtting intervals starting at higher t/a (the plot is
qualitatively similar to the lower right plot of Figure 2). However, before a deﬁnite conclusion
can be reached, the signal-to-noise ratio drops too much, i.e. it is not excluded that ﬁts starting
at even higher t/a would give even smaller values of the mass, thus lowering our preferred
central value and increasing the ﬁtting range uncertainty. Another hint for this interpretation
is provided by the results from our ﬁnest lattice spacing (D ensembles, blue points in Figure 7).
For these ensembles, the temporal extent of the lattice is T /a = 48 (as compared to T /a = 32
or T /a = 24 for the other ensembles) and hence larger Euclidean times in lattice units can be

reached. Consequently, if the chiral extrapolation is performed using these ensembles alone, the
obtained result is much closer to the experimental value and at this lattice spacing the cut-oﬀ
eﬀects should be rather small. The situation is similar for some of our higher orbital or radial
excitations, but mostly with smaller discrepancies to experimental results of around 2 σ. In such
cases, more precise data at larger temporal separations or better optimized creation operators
might be needed to clarify the situation and to obtain more robust results.

3.1.3 T2 and E representations (spin J = 2)

The T2 representation contains continuum spins J = 2, 3, 4, . . ., while the E representation
contains J = 2, 4, . . .. Thus, if a state with similar mass is present in both T2 and E, it should
corresponds to spin J = 2 or J = 4 (although the latter is most likely excluded for low lying
states).

We extracted three states in the J = 2 channel (i.e. from both representations T2 and E), the
2(2460) with J P = 2+ (Figure 8 for the E representation) and two other states of opposite
D∗
parity, with unknown experimental counterparts.

For the former, the statistical error is quite large and the plateau quality is not very good, which
is reﬂected in the size of the systematic uncertainty related to the choice of the ﬁtting interval.
Moreover, our systematic procedure of extracting the ﬁtting range uncertainty again points to
a possible contamination by excited states, since the results for increasing shift parameter n
(again, the plot for diﬀerent ﬁtting ranges resembles the lower right plot of Figure 2) go down

systematically. However, again the signal-to-noise ratio decreases too quickly to reach a deﬁnite
conclusion. Moreover, the mass value from chiral ﬁts using only our D ensembles is much closer
to the experimental value than the one from the chiral and continuum extrapolation taking all
ensembles into account. Hence, we interpret the observed discrepancy as a sign that this state
is among those for which the lattice techniques need to be improved for a reliable extraction,
e.g. by using operators with better overlap with the desired state.

The other two extracted states in this channel (J P = 2−) suﬀer even more from the aforemen-
tioned problem. Therefore, we do not quote any value for them. We only remark that the chiral
extrapolation from only the D ensembles leads to a value consistent with the experimental one
for the D(2750) meson. The presence of another state with these quantum numbers points to the
possible existence of another, rather closely lying state, which can be expected to be discovered
experimentally (two close lying states with J P = 2− were also oberved in Ref. [16]).

3.2 Ds mesons

3.2.1 A1 representation (spin J = 0)

We treat the two lowest lying charm-strange mesons in the A1 representation very similarly to
the charm-light ones. The ground state Ds meson (J P = 0−) can be extracted from lattice
results rather precisely (Figure 9), i.e. with a relative error smaller than two per mille, which
is the best precision from among all our states. We ﬁnd agreement with experiment and the
eﬀective mass plateau quality is very good such that the uncertainty from the choice of the

ﬁtting range is slightly smaller than the statistical error (see the upper right plot of Figure 2).
The precision of the data allows also to obtain the slopes of the chiral extrapolation (α(+,−)
and α(+,+)) with small statistical errors and we ﬁnd that they are compatible: −0.166(12)
and −0.168(13), respectively. This conﬁrms the expectation that discretization eﬀects in the
α parameters are quite small, i.e. that higher order terms proportional to a2(m2
π,exp) are
negligible in equations (16) and (17). We also note that the discretization eﬀects in the (+,−)
setup are much smaller (c(+,−) = −1.0(4)) than those in the (+, +) setup (c(+,+) = +4.7(4)).
This again agrees with our expectations – as mentioned above, the (+,−) setup is known to
usually give smaller cut-oﬀ eﬀects in comparison with the (+, +) valence quark discretization for
light-light and heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons. However, this is not the case for all investigated
mesons and we will comment more about this when discussing other states and in Section 3.4.2.

similar conclusions regarding its structure as for the D∗
0 meson, i.e. that it is a roughly equal
superposition of quarks in an S wave and a P wave (cf. the discussion in Section 3.1.1). We
obtain rather good statistical precision. The ﬁtting range uncertainty is twice larger, but still we
observe an almost 3 σ discrepancy with respect to experiment. Note that this meson is frequently
considered to be a tetraquark candidate and many previous studies based on quark models (e.g.
[5]) and lattice QCD (e.g. [16]) found its mass to be in contradiction with experiment when
assuming the standard quark-antiquark structure. The latter was also used in our setup and
hence we are not in a position to present unambiguos evidence for or against a tetraquark or
some other exotic structure, but our result is indicative of some non-standard behavior.

The ground state spin-1 Ds meson is the D∗
with experiment when both the statistical and systematic uncertainties are taken into account.
We also extract the two lowest excitations in this channel – the J P = 1+ states with j ≈ 1/2
(Ds1(2460), Figure 12) and j ≈ 3/2 (Ds1(2536), Figure 13), where j again denotes the spin of
light degrees of freedom. In both cases, our result is above the PDG value. For Ds1(2460), the
discrepancy remains at the level of 8 σ even with systematic uncertainties taken into account.
As for the D∗
s0, this might indicate that this state is not a standard meson, but rather has some
exotic structure. Similar conclusions have been obtained using quark models (e.g. [5]), which
is why this meson is often considered as a tetraquark candidate. The Ds1(2536) is the charm-
strange analogue of D1(2420). Having j ≈ 3/2, it is expected to share the same problems as
D1(2420). Indeed, the eﬀective mass plateau quality is rather low and we obtain a mass which is
slightly too large with respect to experiment. However, for this case, our systematic procedure
points to a large ﬁtting range uncertainty of around 85 MeV. Within this uncertainty, the mass
agrees with experiment. As for the corresponding D1(2420), an optimization of the creation
operator might help to obtain a more precise result.

3.2.3 T2 and E representations (spin J = 2)

We could extract one state in the spin-2 channel (Figure 14), using both the E and the T2
representation – the D∗
s2(2573) meson (J P = 2+). As for the analogous charm-light state

value of the mass: 2.5719(8) GeV. Our lattice QCD result (E representation): 2.734(25) GeV
(only statistical error, magenta), 2.734(83) GeV (total error, orange).

(D∗
2(2460)), we observe a rather poor eﬀective mass plateau quality, with no obvious choice
of the ﬁtting interval. Our systematic procedure to capture such eﬀects hence generates a
large uncertainty (70..80 MeV, see the lower right plot of Figure 2 for the E representation).
Within the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty, our result is consistent with the
experimental value.

We also observe two states with J P = 2−, but the quality of the data is not good enough to quote
a meaningful and trustworthy value (cf. also Section 3.1.3 for a discussion of the corresponding
charm-light states).

3.3 Charmonium

As in Ref. [45], we neglect disconnected diagrams in the computation of charmonium states.
Although this introduces a systematic error, it is expected to be tiny – much smaller than
statistical errors and systematic errors from other sources. The eﬀects of disconnected diagrams
were estimated in quenched lattice computations [68] and also perturbatively [69, 70, 71], both
estimates yielding shifts in the range of 1 MeV to 4 MeV.

3.3.1 A1 representation (spin J = 0)

The ground state charmonium is the ηc(1S) meson (J PC = 0−+), see Figure 15. It can be ex-
tracted with excellent precision and the plateau quality is very good, such that the uncertainty
from the choice of the ﬁtting interval is negligible compared to the statistical error (see the

upper left plot of Figure 2). The slope of the chiral extrapolation has been determined rather
precisely (with approximately 10% precision) and again we ﬁnd that the (+,−) and (+, +)
discretizations have within errors the same pion mass dependence: α(+,−) = −0.259(23) and
α(+,+) = −0.270(25). In the end, we obtain excellent agreement of our continuum extrapolated
lattice result with experiment. It is interesting to note that we observe much smaller discretiza-
tion eﬀects in the (+, +) setup than in the (+,−) setup (c(+,−) = −13.1(9), c(+,+) = −5.0(9)).
Hence, the often quoted rule that the (+,−) setup leads to smaller cut-oﬀ eﬀects (as is indeed
the case e.g. for the mesons used in the present work for tuning of strange and charm quark
masses, i.e. the π, K and D mesons) is not universal, as will be discussed in more detail in
Section 3.4.2.
The ﬁrst excitation in the J PC = 0−+ channel is the ηc(2S) meson (Figure 16). After combining
our statistical and systematic uncertainties, we obtain a result which is slightly above the PDG
value, by around 2 σ. Our systematic procedure again reveals that the meson mass is decreasing
with increasing shift parameter n, see the lower left plot of Figure 2. To check the robustness
of this result, one would need to go to even higher shifts (i.e. ﬁtting ranges starting and ending
at later Euclidean times) and for this, the data quality is not suﬃcient. As before in cases of
similar plateau quality, the extrapolation from the D ensembles alone, where the ﬁtting range
uncertainties are expected to be smaller (with small discretization eﬀects in addition), leads to
a value fully consistent with the PDG value.

We also observe a crude signal of the next excitation, the ηc(3S) meson, which is not included
in PDG, but has been previously observed in lattice QCD computations [20, 29] at unphysically
heavy pion masses. The signal-to-noise ratio of our data and hence the plateau quality in our

computation are, however, not good enough for solid quantitative statements.

The chiral and continuum extrapolation for the positive parity ground state meson (which is due
to twisted mass parity breaking in the same twisted mass sector as the ηc mesons), the χc0(1P )
meson (J PC = 0++), is shown in Figure 17. We observe very small discretization eﬀects in the
(+,−) data and much larger eﬀects for (+, +), just opposite as for the ηc(1S) meson. In both
cases, the pion mass dependence is very mild, with the slope almost compatible with zero. The
agreement with the PDG value is excellent.

3.3.2 T1 representation (spin J = 1)

We are able to extract four low lying J PC = 1−− states in the T1 representation. The mass
of the ground state, the J/ψ(1S) meson, in the continuum limit and at physical quark masses
(Figure 18), has been obtained with a relative error of less than two per mille. It allows again a
precise comparison of the slopes of the chiral extrapolations: α(+,−) = −0.241(26) and α(+,+) =
−0.240(24), i.e. there is no diﬀerence between the two employed discretizations of valence quarks.
The magnitude of cut-oﬀ eﬀects is also similar for (+,−) and (+, +), but slightly smaller for
the former (c(+,−) = −5.5(8), c(+,+) = −7.5(8)). We also note very good eﬀective mass plateau
quality, resulting in negligible uncertainty from the choice of the ﬁtting interval.

The ﬁrst excitation with J PC = 1−− corresponds to the ψ(2S) meson (Figure 19) and its
experimental mass is well reproduced in our computation. For the second excitation, the ψ(3770)
meson (Figure 20), we obtain a mass slightly larger than the PDG value, but still compatible
within errors (discrepancy of around 1.5 σ).

Figure 21: Chiral and continuum extrapolation for the third excited state with quantum num-
bers PC = −− and most likely J = 1. An obvious experimental counterpart is not available.
Our lattice QCD result: 3.951(22) GeV (only statistical error, magenta), 3.951(36) GeV (total
error, orange).

The next excited state with PC = −− could either be the next excitation with J PC = 1−− or a
state with higher spin (most probably J PC = 3−−). The former interpretation is favoured, since
we obtain a mass of 3.951(36) GeV (cf. Figure 21) and we do not observe a state with a similar
mass in the T2 representation (thus J = 3 seems unlikely; however, it can not be excluded, since
the signal for it might be too weak in our computation) and neither any obvious counterpart in
A1 nor in E (which should exclude spin J = 4). The eﬀective mass plateau quality is reasonable
for this state, as well as the shift parameter plateau. Moreover, the extracted continuum value is
compatible with the one from D ensembles alone. This indicates that the estimated uncertainties
are under control. Since there is no experimental result available, we compare to another lattice
calculation [20] (at a single lattice spacing of 0.12 fm, much coarser than our coarsest one) and
to a Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter approach [7], which both give masses in the range
between 3.85 GeV and 3.9 GeV, i.e. are qualitatively consistent with our result.
We ﬁnd two mesons of positive parity in the T1 representation – the χc1(1P ) meson (J PC = 1++,
Figure 22) and the hc(1P ) meson (J PC = 1+−, Figure 23). The data quality for both these states
is very good and we obtain excellent agreement with experimental values.

3.3.3 E and T2 representations (spin J = 2)

The lowest lying state in both the E and T2 representations has a similar continuum value at
physical quark masses and hence it can be attributed spin J = 2. Experimentally, it corresponds
to the χc2(1P ) meson (J PC = 2++). We obtain agreement with experiment and the total error

is dominated by the ﬁtting range uncertainty, which is much larger than the statistical error.
We show our ﬁts for the E representation in Figure 24 (the plot for the T2 representation is very
similar).
The next extracted state in the E representation (Figure 25) has quantum numbers PC = −−.
Most probably, it corresponds to J = 2, since a state with similar mass is also found in the T2
representation. Assuming J = 2, it corresponds to the experimentally not established ψ2(1P )
meson. We again compare to Refs. [20] and [7]. Our continuum and physical pion mass result
is compatible with the lattice QCD result of Ref. [20] (only a single lattice spacing a ≈ 0.12 fm)
and around 200 MeV higher than the Bethe-Salpeter result of Ref. [7].
The second excitation in the E representation corresponds to PC = −+. It agrees within the
total error with the lowest T2 representation state with PC = −+ – hence, it can be attributed
J = 2. Such a state is again experimentally not clearly identiﬁed, i.e. it is not included in the
PDG review. The naming scheme would suggest the name ηc2(1P ). Our continuum and chiral
extrapolation for the E representation state is shown in Figure 26. The total error is dominated
by the ﬁtting uncertainty and we do not observe a clear plateau in the shift parameter dependence
of the meson mass. Hence, our result should be treated with caution and needs to be conﬁrmed
in the future. Our continuum and physical pion mass result is around 100 MeV higher than
the lattice QCD and Bether-Salpeter results [20, 7], but we note that our result using only the
coarsest lattice spacing (A ensembles) is compatible with Ref. [20] at a single and even coarser
lattice spacing.

Finally, we extract one more state in the E and T2 representations, with quantum numbers
PC = ++ (see Figure 27). The mass is close to 4.5 GeV, with a statistical uncertainty of around

30 MeV and a ﬁtting range uncertainty between 50 MeV and 60 MeV. Since it appears in both
representations, it could have J = 2 but also J = 4 can not be excluded, taking into account the
large value of the mass. At present, we are not able to clearly associate it to any experimentally
observed state. Comparing to Ref. [20], we ﬁnd that our A ensembles results (around 4.05...4.15
GeV) are compatible with the result of this paper (a ≈ 0.12 fm), both for J PC = 2++ and
J PC = 4++ (around 4 GeV and 4.1 GeV, respectively). However, we predict that possible future
experiments will ﬁnd a higher mass, because our continuum result is around 4.5 GeV and the
one from the D ensembles is between 4.2 GeV and 4.3 GeV. Due to the rather poor signal quality
and large cut-oﬀ eﬀects, we do not quote a ﬁnal value for this state.

3.4 Analysis of further systematic eﬀects

The systematic errors are dominated by the ﬁtting range uncertainties, which have already been
discussed extensively. We now investigate and quantify other sources of systematic errors.

3.4.1 Finite volume eﬀects

We expect that the ﬁnite volume eﬀects (FVE) are small in our computation – all our ensembles
have rather large mπL (with smallest mπL of 3.4 and only three ensembles with mπL < 4) and
moreover, FVE are probably strongly suppressed because our meson creation operators do not
directly generate additional pions but only excite much heavier mesons (none of our creation

conﬁrms that ﬁnite volume eﬀects are negligible. The errors are only statistical, but the same
temporal ﬁtting intervals are chosen for both ensembles.

operators contains a light quark and a light antiquark). Nonetheless, we performed a dedicated
analysis of FVE comparing ensembles A40.24 and A40.32, i.e. two volumes with the same lattice
spacing, with spatial lattice extents of around 2.1 fm (mπL ≈ 3.5) and 2.8 fm (mπL ≈ 4.5),
respectively.

In Figures 28 and 29, we compare the D and Ds meson and charmonium masses computed
for these ensembles. We observe fully compatible results for both valence quark discretizations.
In most cases, the diﬀerences between the two volumes are below 1 σ and the number of cases

Table 3: Neutral D meson, Ds meson and charmonium masses using diﬀerent strategies for the
combined chiral and continuum extrapolation (see Section 2.3.3).

where this diﬀerence is larger than 1 σ is close to the expected 32%. We therefore conclude
that, according to our expectations, FVE are negligible when computating masses of mesons
containing charm quarks for our gauge ﬁeld ensembles.

3.4.2 Choice of the ﬁtting ansatz for the combined chiral and continuum extrap-

olation

Another source of systematic uncertainty is related to the combined chiral and continuum ex-
trapolation. We try to quantify this uncertainty by considering and comparing three diﬀerent
types of ﬁtting ans¨atze, with six, ﬁve or four ﬁtting parameters, as discussed in Section 2.3.3

35

(Strategy 1, Strategy 2 and Strategy 3, respectively). In Table 3, we list the chirally and contin-
uum extrapolated values of the meson masses for all considered states (for charm-light mesons,
we show results corresponding to neutral D mesons; the results for the charged counterparts are
collected in Table 5 only for Strategy 2, but diﬀerences due to the variation of ﬁtting strategies
are nearly identical). Fitting Strategy 2 and Strategy 3 assume a common continuum limit for
the (+,−) and (+, +) valence quark discretizations and diﬀer only in the additional assumption
of a common (Strategy 3) or possibly diﬀerent (Strategy 2) slope of the chiral extrapolation. As
can be seen in the table, the resulting meson masses are almost identical – hence, the assumption
about a discretization independent slope of the chiral extrapolation seems to be justiﬁed.

On the other hand, Strategy 2 and Strategy 3 diﬀer with respect to Strategy 1 in terms of
the assumption about the common (Strategy 2 and Strategy 3) or possibly diﬀerent (Strategy
1) ﬁnal values for the meson masses obtained from both discretizations. Although common
values are guaranteed by universality, both discretizations diﬀer by cut-oﬀ eﬀects and it is an
important cross-check to conﬁrm that universality is indeed satisﬁed. We ﬁnd that the continuum
extrapolated values from both discretizations agree with each other for almost all of our states
within one standard deviation, with only three exceptions of higher excited states. Hence, these
observations conﬁrm universality.

In addition to testing universality, we also check whether the slopes of the chiral extrapolation
agree within errors for both discretizations. Table 4 contains the values of these slopes for all
three ﬁtting strategies (again, for D mesons, we show results only for the neutral case; values for
charged mesons are almost identical). We note that the statistical errors are rather similar for
both discretizations and hence the common α ≡ α(+,−) = α(+,+) (of Strategy 3) is always close to
the average of α(+,−) and α(+,+) (from Strategy 2 or Strategy 1 – both yield very similar values).
Moreover, α(+,−) and α(+,+) are compatible with each other within one standard deviation for
almost all cases. This implies that, as expected, the dependence of the slopes of the chiral
extrapolation on the discretization can be neglected as a higher-order eﬀect in our computation,
i.e. assuming or not assuming the equality of α(+,−) and α(+,+) has negligible eﬀect compared
to statistical and other types of systematic uncertainties.

In Table 4, we also compare cut-oﬀ eﬀects for all the meson masses for the two considered dis-
cretizations. The expectation from previous ETMC investigations of light pseudoscalar mesons
is that the (+,−) setup has smaller discretization eﬀects than the (+, +) setup. However, as we
already mentioned in the case of ηc(1S), this is not always true. Only for ﬁve of the considered
states, |c(+,−)| < |c(+,+)| (within one standard deviation), while in two cases, |c(+,−)| > |c(+,+)|.
In the remaining around 75% of the cases, c(+,−) and c(+,+) are compatible within statistical
errors. Thus, the conclusion is that cut-oﬀ eﬀects tend to be quite similar in both setups, with
only a slight tendency for smaller discretization eﬀects in the (+,−) setup. However, we conﬁrm
previous ETMC statements that for the states relevant for the tuning of the strange and charm
quark mass (the pion, the kaon and the D meson), cut-oﬀ eﬀects are much smaller in the (+,−)
setup.

For the ﬁnal results presented in Section 4, our preferred ﬁtting strategy is Strategy 2, a com-
promise that assumes universality of the continuum limit, but leaves independent slopes of the
chiral extrapolation. However, as detailed above, the uncertainty associated with the choice of
the ﬁtting ansatz has negligible impact on our ﬁnal results.

3.4.3

Isospin breaking eﬀects

Another type of systematic uncertainty is the breaking of isospin symmetry by electromagnetic
eﬀects (diﬀerent electric charges of up and down quarks) and diﬀerent masses of up and down
quarks. We are not able to address this issue directly and rigorously, since it would require
working in a 1+1+1+1 setup with diﬀerent light quark masses and an inclusion of electromag-
netism, which goes beyond the scope of the present work (for pioneering work regarding such
computations, cf. Refs. [72, 73]).

One simple possibility to estimate the magnitude of these eﬀects is to take the experimentally

37

known diﬀerence of the masses of the charged and neutral D mesons, which is O(5) MeV.
Alternatively, we try to largely eliminate these eﬀects by performing tuning of the strange and
charm quark masses with either the neutral or the charged π, K and D meson masses. As
discussed in Section 2.3.2 and as indicated by the perfect agreement of our lattice results for
e.g. Ds, ηc(1S) and J/ψ(1S), we estimate the remaining systematic errors to be well beyond 5
MeV, which is negligible compared to the statistical errors and the ﬁtting range uncertainties.
As an example, we note that in the case of the D∗ meson (see Table 5), our crude method of
estimating the splitting between the charged and neutral meson masses by comparing results
from diﬀerent input π, K and D meson masses for the strange and charm quark masses tuning,
gives 4 MeV, as compared to the approximately 3.3 MeV experimental splitting.

4 Conclusions

Our ﬁnal results are collected in Table 5 and in Figures 30, 31 and 32. In Table 5, we list meson
names, J P(C) quantum numbers, experimental results according to the PDG [1] and our lattice
QCD results, for which we show mean values, statistical errors, uncertainties associated with
the choice of the ﬁtting range and total errors (statistical errors and ﬁtting range uncertainties
combined in quadrature). For states with total angular momentum J = 2, always two numerical
results are available, one from the E representation, the other from the T2 representation. In
all cases, these results are compatible within errors. As ﬁnal results we use the ones from the
E representation, because for those, contamination by J = 3 states is excluded. Similarly, in
Figures 30, 31 and 32, we summarize and compare our lattice QCD results (dark colored boxes
represent statistical, light colored boxes total errors) to experimental results (gray boxes with
black edges).

4.1 D mesons (charm-light mesons)

The D meson (J P = 0−), i.e. the lightest charm-light meson, plays a special role in our com-
putation. The (+,−) lattice QCD results are used to tune the valence charm quark mass and,
hence, cannot be considered as predictions. The corresponding (+, +) results are in excellent
agreement with experiment (cf. the ﬁrst two lines in Table 5), which is a convincing test of
universality, but again they are not lattice QCD predictions of the D0 and D± meson masses.
Moreover, we do not quote ﬁtting interval uncertainties, since the eﬀective mass plateaus for
this state are extremely long and clear and the resulting uncertainties are, hence, negligible.
The latter is one of the reasons for using this state for the valence charm quark mass tuning
procedure discussed in Section 2.3.2.

0(2400) and D1(2430) (J P = 0+ and 1+; both j ≈ 1/2, where
For D∗ (J P = 1−) as well as for D∗
j denotes the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom), we ﬁnd agreement with
experiment. Since the latter two states are quite unstable, a more rigorous coumputation of their
masses (and also widths) would require to treat them as resonances and use e.g. the L¨uscher’s
method in combination with suitable four-quark creation operators. Such a computation, how-
ever, is signiﬁcantly more challenging and computer time consuming than the methods used in
this work, which are based on creation operators of quark-antiquark type only. A recent ex-
ploratory resonance study of D∗
0(2400) and D1(2430) using a single lattice spacing (a ≈ 0.124 fm)
and a single pion mass (mπ ≈ 266 MeV) can be found in Ref. [29].

Table 5: Summary of our lattice QCD results for D meson, Ds meson and charmonium masses
in GeV (central value, statistical error, ﬁtting range uncertainty, total error). For comparison,
we also list experimental results according to the PDG [1]. (A) Since the (+,−) D meson mass is
used for valence charm quark mass tuning, not a prediction, just a check of universality of our two
discretizations (+,−) and (+, +). (B) Discrepancy of ≈ 3 . . . 4 σ to experiment, presumably due
to contamination by excited states. (C) Discrepancy of ≈ 3 . . . 8 σ to experiment, presumably an
indication that both D∗
s0(2317) and Ds1(2460) have a non-q ¯q-like structure. (D) Our theoretical
prediction, no established experimental counterpart available. (E) No clear assignment of total
angular momentum possible, J = 1 favored, but J = 3 not completely ruled out. A candidate for
an experimental result for the third J PC = 1−− excitation is ψ(4040) with mass 4.039(1) GeV.

2(2460) (J P = 1+
The resulting masses for the remaining two extracted states, D1(2420) and D∗
and 2+; both j ≈ 3/2), are around 3 . . . 4 σ above the experimental results7. We attribute
this discrepancy to technical problems, in particular a not suﬃcently optimized choice of the
meson creation operators (cf. the E and T2 segments of Table 2) and thus a contamination
of eﬀective mass plateaus by excited states. This is indicated by our procedure to determine
the ﬁtting range uncertainties, which exhibits a systematic decrease of the extracted meson
masses when using ﬁtting intervals starting at increasingly larger temporal separations. Before
an unambigous plateau is reached, the signal is lost in statistical noise. This interpretation
is additionally supported when considering only gauge link ensembles with the ﬁnest lattice
spacing (D ensembles). There, it is easier to identify eﬀective mass plateaus, because a given
temporal range in physical units corresponds to a larger number of discrete lattice separations.
A chiral extrapolation from the D ensembles only results in masses compatible with experiment
for both D1(2420) and D∗

2(2460).

4.2 Ds mesons (charm-strange mesons)

The overall picture for charm-strange mesons is quite similar. We have obtained very robust
results for the Ds (J P = 0−) and the D∗
s0 and Ds1(2460) (J P = 0+ and 1+; both j ≈ 1/2), our resulting lattice QCD masses

7In this context, it is interesting to note that we have observed a very similar behavior for the corresponding

j ≈ 3/2 B mesons [67].

seem to be well controlled. Similar discrepancies to experimental results have been found in
other lattice QCD studies based on quark-antiquark creation operators [16] and in quark model
calculations [5]. A possible explanation could be that both the D∗
s0 and the Ds1(2460) have a
structure quite diﬀerent from an ordinary quark-antiquark pair, e.g. a mesonic molecule or a
diquark-antidiquark structure (cf. e.g. [74, 75] where such scenarios are discussed theoretically).
It would be interesting to include corresponding four-quark creation operators into our lattice
QCD computation and to see whether the masses of these two states decrease and the associated
eigenvector components indicate a sizable four-quark contribution.
In a recent lattice QCD
study using both two- and four-quark creation operators, strong evidence has been presented
that four-quark creation operators are essential to properly resolve these states [35].
s2(2573) (J P = 1+
The resulting masses for the remaining two extracted states, Ds1(2536) and D∗
and 2+; both j ≈ 3/2), are slightly above the experimental results, but still compatible within
the total errors. Analogous to the corresponding D mesons, we expect that an optimization of
the meson creation errors could help to reduce the rather large ﬁtting range uncertainty and
thus lead to more precise predictions.

4.3 Charmonium (charm-charm mesons)

We were able to determine the masses of several states rather precisely and in excellent agreement
with experimental results, including the ηc(1S), χc0(1P ), J/ψ(1S), χc1(1P ), hc(1P ) and χc2(1P )
(the ground states in the sectors J PC = 0−+, 0++, 1−−, 1++, 1+−, 2++). For the masses of the
excited states ηc(2S) (J PC = 0−+) and ψ(2S), ψ(3770) (both J PC = 1−−), the total errors are

larger, but results are consistent with experiment.

We were also able to predict three states, which have no established experimental counterparts
yet: ηc2(1P ) (J PC = 2−+), ψ2(1P ) (J PC = 2−−) and a state with either J PC = 1−− or J PC =
3−−. For the latter, we favour to interpret it as the third excitation in the J PC = 1−− sector,
as discussed in Section 3.3.2. These predictions are qualitatively similar to those from another
recent lattice QCD study using only a single unphysically heavy u/d quark mass (mπ ≈ 396 MeV)
and a single lattice spacing [20] and with a calculation based on Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter
equations [7]. It should be noted that the ﬁtting range uncertainties for these three predictions
are comparably large. Therefore, the possibility of contamination by excited states cannot
be fully excluded. We compare our results with corresponding chiral extrapolations from D
ensemble data only, where eﬀective mass plateaus can be identiﬁed most reliably. We ﬁnd
agreement in all three cases, which is reassuring and indicates that the total errors quoted in
Table 5 realistically reﬂect the uncertainties of these three predictions.

4.4 Summary and outlook

We have computed the low-lying D meson, Ds meson and charmonium spectra using Wilson
twisted mass lattice QCD with 2+1+1 ﬂavors of sea quarks and meson creation operators of
quark-antiquark type. We were able to determine 5 D meson masses, 6 Ds meson masses
and 12 charmonium masses, where three of the latter are theoretical predictions with no cur-
rently existing or clearly identiﬁed experimental counterparts. We have performed computa-
tions on nine diﬀerent gauge link ensembles at three diﬀerent lattice spacings in the range

42

a ≈ 0.0619 . . . 0.0885 fm and pion masses mπ ≈ 224 . . . 468 MeV. Moreover, all computations
have been done with two diﬀerent valence quark discretizations. Using the resulting 18 mass
values for each meson state allowed us to perform combined continuum and chiral extrapola-
tions. These extrapolations seem to be very solid and trustworthy as e.g. demonstrated by the
corresponding plots for Ds and ηc(1S) (which have very small statistical errors; cf. Figure 9 and
Figure 15). Similarly, we have performed computations also with two slightly diﬀerent values of
the valence strange quark mass as well as of the valence charm quark mass for each meson state.
This allowed us not only to tune these quark masses precisely to their physical values, but also to
crudely estimate electromagnetic eﬀects. Finally, by comparison with analogous computations
on another ensemble with rather small volume, we were able to demonstrate that ﬁnite volume
eﬀects are negligible. The masses collected in Table 5 and in Figures 30, 31 and 32 are listed
and shown with a total error accounting for all these eﬀects and, hence, can be compared to
existing or future experimental data in a direct and meaningful way.
We were also able to clearly distinguish the two close-by J P = 1+ D meson states D1(2430)
and D1(2420) and the two analogous Ds meson states Ds1(2460) and Ds1(2536) according to
their light total angular momentum j ≈ 1/2 and j ≈ 3/2. This is not only important when
comparing with experimental results, but also when studying semileptonic decays B → D∗∗,
where D∗∗ = {D∗
2(2460)}. Such decays are of particular inter-
est, because there is a long standing conﬂict between theory and experiment (QCD sum rules,
model calculations), the so-called 1/2 versus 3/2 puzzle [76]. Recently, decays B → D∗
0 and
B → D∗
2 have been studied on the same gauge link ensembles for the ﬁrst time with non-static
b and c quarks [77, 78]. Using the same techniques and the results on D1(2430) and D1(2420)
presented in this work will allow to also include B → D1. This in turn should provide important
insights regarding the 1/2 versus 3/2 puzzle from theoretical methods based on ﬁrst principles.

0(2400) , D1(2430) , D1(2420) , D∗

Our future plans are mainly focused on studying speciﬁc D mesons, Ds mesons or charmonium
states with a larger set of creation operators, including in particular four-quark operators of
either mesonic molecule, diquark-antidiquark or two-meson type. Existing lattice QCD studies
[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] strongly indicate that such techniques are mandatory for a
rigorous treatment of certain mesons, e.g. the tetraquark candidates D∗
s0(2317) and Ds1(2460).
We are currently in the process of developing such techniques, in particular to eﬃciently compute
corresponding correlation matrix elements [38, 39, 40].
