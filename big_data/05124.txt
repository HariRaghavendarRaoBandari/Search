J´onsson’s Characterization of Distributive

Sublattices of Free Lattices

Calgary

Abstract

In 1959, F.Galvin and B.J´onsson characterized distributive sub-
lattices of free lattices in their paper [1]. In this paper, I will create
new proofs to a portion of Galvin and J´onsson’s work in [1]. Based on
these new proofs, I will explore possible generalizations of F.Galvin
and B.J´onsson’s work by deﬁning spanning pairs and proving partial
results which may help with analysing ﬁnite width sublattices of free
lattices; and by making some new observations on ﬁnitely generated
lattices over semidistributive varieties.

The work done in this paper may assist in attacking the following
long-standing open problem: Which countable lattices are isomorphic
to a sublattice of a free lattice?

1 Distributive Sublattices of Free Lattices

Among lattices known to be isomorphic to countable sublattices of free lat-
tices, those isomorphic to distributive sublattices of free lattices are the eas-
iest to describe.
In 1959, F. Galvin and B. J´onsson characterized, up to
isomorphism, distributive sublattices of free lattices in their paper [1]. Their
characterization will be over-viewed in this section and I will derive new
proofs to a portion of their work. These new proofs have some similarities
with work in [1] from F. Galvin and B. J´onsson and with work from 1974 in

[9] by W. Poguntke and I. Rival.

We ﬁrst introduce some basic operations. If K and L are lattices, then
K × L is their direct product where (p, q) ∨ (r, s) = (p ∨ r, q ∨ s) and
(p, q) ∧ (r, s) = (p ∧ r, q ∧ s) for all p ∈ K and q ∈ L. Let hL; ≤Li and
hK; ≤Ki be lattices such that L ∩ K = ∅. Then the linear sum L ⊕ K of L
and K is the lattice hL ∪ K; ≤i such that:

(1) For all p, q ∈ L, p ≤ q if and only if p ≤L q.

(2) For all p, q ∈ K, p ≤ q if and only if p ≤K q.

(3) For all p ∈ L and q ∈ K, p ≤ q.

Generalizing this operation, one may consider a family of lattices {hLi; ≤i
i : i ∈ I} indexed by a partially ordered set hI; ≤Ii such that for all indices
i 6= j in I, Li ∩ Lj = ∅. Then the lexicographic sum of this family is the
lattice hSi∈I Li; ≤i with the binary relation ≤ deﬁned as follows:

(1) For all p, q ∈ Li, p ≤ q.

(2) For all i ≤I j in hI; ≤Ii, if i 6= j, then for all p ∈ Li and q ∈ Lj, p ≤ q.

Inspired by [2] and [1] we will deﬁne, in this paper, a linear sum indexed
by I to be the lexicographic sum of the family {hLi; ≤ii : i ∈ I} indexed by
a chain I. We denote such a lexicographic sum by Li∈I Li.

F. Galvin and B. J´onsson’s characterization of lattices isomorphic to dis-
tributive sublattices of free lattices is as follows. We use notation from [2]
by letting n = h{0, 1, . . . , n − 1}; ≤i with 0 < 1 < · · · < n − 1:

Theorem 1 (F. Galvin and B. J´onsson) Let L be a distributive lattice.
Then L is isomorphic to a sublattice of a free lattice if and only if L ∼= Li∈I Li
where Li∈I Li is a linear sum indexed by a countable chain I and for all i ∈ I:
|Li| = 1, Li

∼= 2 × 2 × 2, or L = 2 × C where C is a countable chain.

Theorem 3 implies that all distributive sublattices of free lattices are

2

countable and have a width of at most three. An important ingredient for
Theorem 1 is Theorem 2:

Theorem 2 (F. Galvin and B. J´onsson, [1]) Let L be a distributive lat-
tice. Then L has no doubly reducible elements if and only if L ∼= Li∈I Li
where Li∈I Li is a linear sum indexed by a chain I and for all i ∈ I: |Li| = 1,
Li

∼= 2 × 2 × 2, or L = 2 × C where C is a chain.

Theorem 2 characterizes distributive lattices which satisfy Whitman’s
Condition. This is because all lattices that satisfy Whitman’s Condition
have no doubly reducible elements and all lattices described in Theorem 2
satisfy Whitman’s Condition.

To prove Theorem 2 three propositions are needed: Proposition 1, Propo-
sition 2, and Proposition 3. These three propositions constitute the majority
of Galvin and J´onsson’s paper [1]. Proposition 1 is quite well-known in lit-
erature on free lattices. We refer the reader to [3], [5], or to [1] to see how
to prove Proposition 1. In the next section, I will write my new proofs to
Proposition 2 and Proposition 3.

Proposition 1 (Galvin and J´onsson) All chains in a free lattice are count-
able.

Proposition 2 (Galvin and J´onsson) If L is a linearly indecomposable
distributive lattice with no doubly reducible elements, then L has a width of
at most two or L is isomorphic to 2 × 2 × 2.

Proposition 3 (Galvin and J´onsson) All width two distributive lattices
that are linearly indecomposable and have no doubly reducible elements are
isomorphic to 2 × C where C is a chain.

1.1 Distributive Sublattices Part 1

We analyse distributive sublattices of free lattices which have a width of
at least three. Speciﬁcally, Proposition 2 from F. Galvin and B. J´onsson is
proven in a new way. F. Galvin and B. J´onsson’s original proof involved intri-
cate calculations with carefully selected lattice terms (see [1]). Although the
new proof in this subsection has similaritie s to F. Galvin and B. J´onsson’s
arguments, it uses a lattice, the free distributive lattice on 3 generators, to

3

capture all possible cases that may be encountered.

The following more general concept (see [3] and [4]) is useful for describing

free distributive lattices:

Deﬁnition 1 (Relatively Free Lattices) Let V be a variety of lattices and X
be a set. Then the relatively free lattice in V over X is the lattice unique up to
lattice isomorphism, FV(X), such that for any lattice L in the variety V and
any mapping, f : X → L, there is a lattice homomorphism, h : FV (X) → L,
such that, for all x ∈ X, h(x) = f (x).

A free distributive lattice on a set X, written as F D(X), is the relatively
free lattice FD(X) where D is the variety of distributive lattices. If V is a
variety of lattices, we sometimes denote FV(X) by FV (|X|). The elements of
X are called the generators of FV (X). We occasionally denote F D(X) by
F D(|X|).

My proof of Proposition 2 is as follows.

Proof : (Brian T. Chan) Let D be a distributive lattice with no doubly
reducible elements. Instead of manipulating terms directly in D, as done in
[1], we look at the free distributive lattice on 3 generators in Figure 3.1 which
we denote by F D({a, b, c}). It can be shown (see [2]) that for any positive
integer n, the elements of F D(n) can be identiﬁed with the nonempty an-
tichains of P(P(S)\{∅}) where P is the power set operation and |S| = n.

We ﬁrst prove Lemma 1 of [1]: If {p, q, r} ⊆ D is an antichain, then the

sublattice generated by {p, q, r} is isomorphic to 2 × 2 × 2.

As D is distributive, there is a lattice homomorphism f : F D({a, b, c}) →
D induced by the mapping: a 7→ p, b 7→ q, and c 7→ r. Now let ≡ be the con-
gruence on F D({a, b, c} such that s ≡ t if and only if f (s) = f (t). Consider
the element z = (a∨b)∧(b∨c)∧(c∨a) = (a∧b)∨(b∧c)∨(c∧a) in F D({a, b, c}).

In [1], the element f (z) was analysed in D. Moreover, the authors as-
sumed without loss of generality that f (z) is join irreducible. We use this
assumption for F D({a, b, c}) by assuming that z is join irreducible. For this
to occur we assume without loss of generality that z ≡ (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) and

4

z ≡ (a ∧ c) ∨ (b ∧ c).

Since congruences are compatible with join and meet, we can more eas-
ily calculate quotient lattices of a ﬁnite lattice. We recall the notion of a
congruence lattice from Chapter 2: In Figure 3.2, the leftmost lattice is the
quotient lattice F D({a, b, c})/ ≡1 where ≡1 is the congruence con(x, (a∧b) ∨
(a ∧ c)) ∈ Con(F D({a, b, c})) and the middle lattice is the quotient lattice
F D({a, b, c})/ ≡2 where ≡2 is the congruence

con(x, (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)) ∨ con(x, (a ∧ c) ∨ (b ∧ c)) ∈ Con(F D({a, b, c})).

Referring to Figure 3.2, consider y = b ∨ (a ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c)
in F D({a, b, c})/ ≡. Another parallel between this proof and Galvin and
J´onsson’s original proof is that in [1], the element f (y) ∈ D was analysed.
Since {a, b, c} is an antichain in F D({a, b, c}) and in D, {a, b, c} is an an-
tichain in F D({a, b, c})/ ≡2. Moreover, f (y) cannot be doubly reducible in
D and lattice congruences are compatible with join and meet. Hence, y ≡ b
and the resulting quotient lattice, F D({a, b, c})/ ≡, is obtained thus proving
Lemma 1 of [1].

Remark 1 In any distributive lattice H if {p1, p2, . . . , pn} ⊆ H is an an-
tichain such that for some z ∈ H, z = pi ∧ pj for all i 6= j then it can
be veriﬁed using the distributive laws that the sublattice of H generated by
{p1, p2, . . . , pn} is isomorphic to the 2n element boolean algebra (see [1]).

Remark 2 Since D has no doubly reducible elements, we note that D cannot
have a sublattice isomorphic to 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 or to 2 × 2 × 3 because those
two lattices have doubly reducible elements.

To see that the width of D is three, suppose that {p, q, r, s} ⊆ D is an an-
tichain. We use Lemma 1 of [1]. The lattice 2×2×2 has two antichains of car-
dinality three: {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} and {(0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0)}. So
assume without loss of generality that p∧q = q∧r = r∧p. If q∧r = r∧s = s∧q
then by Remark 1, {p, q, r, s} generates a sublattice of D isomorphic to the
boolean lattice 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. Moreover, if q ∨ r = r ∨ s = s ∨ q then as the
sublattice of D generated by {q, r, s} is isomorphic to 2 × 2 × 2, it can be
checked that {p, q, r, s} generates a sublattice of D isomorphic to 2 × 2 × 3.

5

But that is impossible by Remark 2. Hence, the width of D must be three.

Since the width of D is three, let {p, q, r} ⊆ D be an antichain and as-
sume without loss of generality that for some element z ∈ D, z = p ∧ q =
q ∧ r = r ∧ p. Because D is linearly indecomposable, it is enough to show
by contradiction that if s ∈ D is not in the sublattice generated by {p, q, r}
then s ≤ z = p ∧ q ∧ r or s ≥ p ∨ q ∨ r.

So suppose that the above claim in not true. By duality it is enough to
consider when s is comparable to exactly one element of {p, q, r} and less
than or equal to at least one element of {p ∨ q, q ∨ r, r ∨ p}. So without loss
of generality we can assume that z < s < p for the following reasons:

(1) If s > p we can use the fact that D is modular and consider the ele-

ment s ∧ p. Similar reasoning applies to when s > q or s > r.

(2) If s < p we can use the fact that D has no doubly reducible elements
and consider the elements s ∨ z and p = (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r). Similar reasoning
applies to when s < q or s < r.

We simplify an argument from [1] as follows. Because z < s < p and
p ∧ q = p ∧ r = z, s k q and s k r; so {s, q, r} is an antichain. Moreover it
can be checked, using the fact that D is modular, that {s, s ∨ q, s ∨ r} is also
an antichain. Hence, it can be seen that by Lemma 1 of [1], the sublattice of
D generated by {p, q, r, s} is isomorphic to 2 × 3. But that is impossible by
Remark 2. This completes the proof.

1.2 Distributive Sublattices Part 2

We analyse distributive sublattices of free lattices which have a width of two.
Speciﬁcally, Proposition 3 from F. Galvin and B. J´onsson is proven in a new
way. The new proof has some similarities to, but is more general than, W.
Poguntke and I. Rival’s arguments in [9].

In this paper, we will frequently consider the lattice 2 × Z where Z is the
· · · < −2 < −1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < . . . . Since 2 is the

partially ordered set:

partially ordered set 0 < 1, we write 2 × Z = {(j, k) : j = 0, 1, k ∈ Z}.

For convenience, I will deﬁne the term gadgets. A gadget, written as
GL(p; q, r), is the sublattice of a lattice L generated by {p, q, r} where p, q, r ∈
L, q < r, p k q, and p k r. It turns out that GL(p; q, r) can be isomorphic to
six possible lattices. To see this, we introduce the following concept.

Deﬁnition 2 ([3]) Let hP ; ≤i be a partially ordered set. Then the lattice
freely generated by hP ; ≤i, F L(hP ; ≤i), is the lattice unique up to lattice
isomorphism such that for any lattice L and order preserving map f : X → L,
there is a lattice homomorphism h : F L(hP ; ≤i) → L such that, for all x ∈ X,
h(x) = f (x).

Given two ﬁnite chains m and n, we use notation from [3] and write m+n
to denote the disjoint union of m and n whose partial order is the union of
the partial order on m and the partial order on n.

Consider the lattice F L(1 + 2), depicted in Figure 3, where the elements
of 1 + 2 are denoted {a, b, c} and satisfy: c ≤ c and b < c. There is a
unique lattice homomorphism φ : F L(P ) ։ GL(p; q, r) such that φ(a) = p,
φ(b) = q, and φ(c) = r. Hence, GL(p; q, r) is isomorphic to a quotient lattice
of F L(hP ; ≤i). The gadget GL(p; q, r) can be identiﬁed with the three lat-
tices depicted in Figure 4 and their duals. This can be conﬁrmed using the
fact that all congruences on F L(hP ; ≤i) are compatible with meet and join.

The new proof for Proposition 3 uses a well-known theorem in lattice
theory known as the M3 − N5 theorem (see [2]). Recall the lattices M3, the
diamond, and N5, the pentagon (see [2]). The M3 − N5 theorem implies that
a distributive lattices cannot have a sublattice isomorphic to N5; we will use
this property.

My proof of Proposition 3 is as follows. The last part of the proof can be
simpliﬁed if only countable lattices were considered; the Axiom of Choice is
used for uncountable lattices.

Proof : (Brian T. Chan) Let D be a linearly indecomposable distributive
lattice of width two that has no doubly reducible elements. It is easy to see
that if |D| ≤ 4 then D ∼= 2 × 2. So assume that |D| ≥ 5. Since D is linearly

indecomposable, D cannot be a chain implying that D has a sublattice iso-
morphic to 2 × 2. So as |D| > 4, the fact that D is linearly indecomposable
and has no doubly reducible elements implies that D has at least one gadget.

Because D has no doubly reducible elements and D is linearly indecom-
posable we note that for all sublattices H of D isomorphic to 2 × C for some
chain C, there is an element zH ∈ D such that zH is not an upper bound or
a lower bound of H.

In ZFC set theory, the Axiom of Choice is equivalent to the Well-Ordering
Theorem. The Well-Ordering Theorem implies that there is an ordinal α such
that the set of elements of D can be written as {pj : j ∈ α}. If D is countable,
we assume that α = |D| if D is ﬁnite and that α = ω if D is countably inﬁnite.

Let GD(p; q, r) be a gadget of D for some p, q, r ∈ D. Because D is mod-
ular, the M3 − N5 theorem indicates that GD(p; q, r) is the lattice in Figure
3.4 isomorphic to 2 × 3 or the dual of that lattice. So we identify GD(p; q, r)
with h{s, t, u, x, y, z}; ≤i where the partial order ≤ is as depicted in Figure
3.5.

Figure 5: A gadget in a distributive lattice.

Let J ⊆ α be the non empty set of indices j such that pj /∈ GD(p; q, r)
and pj is neither an upper bound nor a lower bound of GD(p; q, r). Setting i
to be the least element of J in α, let w = pi ∈ L\GD(p; q, r). Using Figure
3.5 as a reference, the sublattice generated by {p, q, r, w} will be shown to
be isomorphic to 2 × 4. Since the width of D is two, it is enough to consider
the following cases:

Case 1 : If u ∧ w = z or x ∨ w = s, then the sublattice generated by

{p, q, r, w} can be seen to be isomorphic to 2 × 4.

Case 2 : Assume that s < w < t. Then as D is modular and y k w, the
sublattice of D generated by {s, w, t} is GD(y; s, w) ∼= 2 × 3. So because
s ∨ y = w ∨ y = t, it follows that the sublattice of D generated by {p, q, r, w}
is isomorphic to 2 × 4. The other three cases t < w < u, x < w < y, and
y < w < z follow by symmetry.

Case 3 : Suppose that z < w < u. We see that t k w, so consider
the gadget GD(t; z, w). Since D is modular, GD(t; z, w) ∼= 2 × 3; and since
t ∨ w = t ∨ z = u, y < t ∧ w < t. But then {s, t ∧ w, z} is an antichain of
D contrary to assumption. A dual argument shows that x < w < s is also
impossible, and if y < w < t then {s, w, z} is an antichain of D contrary to
assumption.

Hence, the sublattice D1 generated by {p, q, r, w} is isomorphic to 2 × 4.
We now carry on a proof by induction. If D1 6= L, then let i be the least

11

element of α such that pi /∈ D1 and pi is neither an upper bound nor a lower
bound of D1. Set w2 = pi ∈ L\D1. Because the width of D is two, the above
argument implies that the sublattice D2 of D generated by {p, q, r, w, w2} is
isomorphic to 2 × 5.

When D is countable, repeating the above argument indeﬁnitely proves
the proposition by induction since α = ω or α is ﬁnite. When D is uncount-
able, we use transﬁnite induction:

We have nested sequence of lattices D1 ⊆ D2 ⊆ . . .

isomorphic to
2 × 3, 2 × 4, . . . Now assume that for all ordinals ζ where Dζ is deﬁned,
∼= 2 ×Cζ for some chain Cζ dependent on ζ where |Cζ| = |ζ|;
Dζ ⊆ D and Dζ
and assume that for all ordinals ζ1 ≤ ζ2 where Dζ1 and Dβ2 are deﬁned,
Dζ1 ⊆ Dζ2. For all limit ordinals κ such that Dζ is deﬁned for all ordinals
ζ < κ, set Dγ = ∪ζ∈γDζ ⊆ D. Now assume that κ is the least successor
ordinal such that Dκ is undeﬁned and D 6= Dκ′ where κ′ is the ordinal such
that κ = κ′ + 1.

Since Dκ′

6= D, let i be the least ordinal in α such that pi /∈ Dκ′ and
pi is not an upper bound or a lower bound of Dκ′, and set wκ = pi. As-
sume without loss of generality that Dκ′ = 2 × Cκ′ for some chain Cκ′.
:
Set I = {q ∈ Cκ′
(q, 0) ≥ wκ or (q, 1) ≥ wκ}. Since the width of D is two, it follows that
Dκ′ = (2 × I) ∪ (2 × F ), (2 × I) ∩ (2 × F ) = ∅, 2 × I is empty or an ideal
of Dκ′, and 2 × F is empty or a ﬁlter of Dκ′.

: (q, 0) ≤ wκ or (q, 1) ≤ wκ} and F = {q ∈ Cκ′

So deﬁne Dκ to be the sublattice of D generated by Dκ′ ∪ {wκ}. By
the above arguments used to construct Dk when k is ﬁnite, it follows that
∼= 2 × Cκ for some chain Cκ satisfying |Cκ| = κ. So as the elements of
Dκ
D are well ordered by α, we see that for some ordinal λ satisfying |λ| ≤ α,
D = Dλ. This completes the proof. (cid:3)

2 Semidistributive Varieties

We consider how developments in Section 1.1 could possibly be generalized.
However, we warn the reader that pursuing the strategies proposed may be
a very arduous task.

12

The new idea used in Section 1.1 was to consider the free distributive
lattice on three generators, F D(3) = FD(3) where D denotes the variety of
distributive lattices. Such a structure can be generalized, and if enough is
known about such a generalization perhaps more countable sublattices of free
lattices can be identiﬁed. We now explore some of these possibilities below.

A variety V of lattices is deﬁned to be semidistributive (see [4]) if every
lattice in V is semidistributive. If S denotes the class of all semidistributive
lattices, we have that D ⊆ V ⊆ S. So a possible idea is to consider the
relatively free lattices FV (3) when V is a semidistributive variety. We note
that there are semidistributive lattices which do not belong in any semidis-
tributive variety, for instance the free lattice F L(3).

The number of semidistributive varieties turns out to be countable. In
1979 B. J´onsson and I. Rival had characterized semidistributive varieties in
[7], and part of their characterization is as follows (see [4]):

Theorem 3 (B. J´onsson and I. Rival)

The following are equivalent for a variety V of lattices:
(1) V is semidistributive.
(2) Let y0 = y, z0 = z, and for all non-negative integers k let yk+1 =
y ∨ (x ∧ zk) and let zk+1 = z ∨ (x ∧ yk). Then for some nonnegative integer
n, the identity

(SD∧

n ) : x ∧ (y ∨ z) = x ∧ yn

and its dual (SD∨

n ) are satisﬁed by every lattice L in V.

Theorem 3 is proven in [7] and [4]. We write Sn to denote the variety of

lattices which satisfy (SD∧

n ) and (SD∨

n ). We have this:

D = S1 ⊂ S2 ⊂ S3 ⊂ · · · ⊂ S

This motivates us to study the following sequence of lattices:

FS1(3), FS2(3), FS3(3), FS4(3), . . . . We note that we have this sequence of onto
homomorphisms:

13

F D(3) = FS1(3) ← FS2(3) ← FS3(3) ← FS4(3) ← . . .

The new proof in Section 1.1, the result of Section 1.1 being largely re-
sponsible for characterizing distributive sublattices of free lattices up to iso-
morphism, relied on knowledge of the lattice FS1(3) = F D(3). Perhaps if we
knew more about the relatively free lattices FS2(3), FS3(3), FS4(3), FS5(3), . . .
we could make progress on the following problem:

Problem 1 Which countable lattices belonging to a semidistributive variety
are isomorphic to a sublattice of a free lattice?

F. Galvin and B. J´onsson’s paper [1] answered Problem 1 for the variety
of distributive lattices. But not much is known even for the variety S2 of
nearsemidistributive lattices.

However, if the lattice FS2(3) is ﬁnite, it may be possible to extend the
new proof from Section 1.1 to analyse near semidistributive sublattices of
free lattices. I will make the following observations:

n denote the variety of lattices which satisfy (SD∧

n ). Then FS ∨

More generally, we can consider the lattices FSk(n) for positive integers k
and n. If FSk(n) is a ﬁnite bounded lattice, then by A. Day’s characterization
theorem, FSk (n) can be obtained from a one element lattice by a sequence of
interval doublings; this construction will be explained in more detail in the
next section. This could be a very useful for generalizing the new proof from
Section 1.1 since we may be able to construct FSk(n) more easily. I will make

the following observation. Recall that the notion of a bounded lattice does
not require the existence of maximum or minimum elements (see [3] and [4]
for deﬁnitions).

Proposition 5 Let n be a positive integer. If FS2(n) is a ﬁnite, then FS2(n)
is a bounded lattice.

Proof :(Brian T. Chan) The lattices L11 and L12 as described in [4] and
H.Rose’s observation from [4] regarding these lattices and C−cycles on ﬁnite
semidistributive lattices will be used. See [4] and [3] for notation or concepts
If FS2(n) is not bounded, then
being used. Assume that FS2(n) is ﬁnite.
without loss of generality assume that FS2(n) 6= D(FS2(n)). As FS2(n) is
ﬁnite, there is a C−cycle in FS2(n). By H. Rose’s observation, it follows that
FS2(n) contains a sublattice isomorphic to L11 or L12. But the lattices L11
and L12 are not neardistributive, which is an impossibility.

(cid:3)
If Whitman’s condition were assumed, then Proposition 5 can be consid-
erably strengthened. By J´onsson’s conjecture, proven by J.B.Nation in 1980
(see [3]), a ﬁnite semidistributive lattice which satisﬁes Whitman’s condition
is a sublattice of a free lattice. Since ﬁnite sublattices of a free lattice are all
bounded, we have the following: Let k and n be positive integers. If FSk (n)
is a ﬁnite lattice which satisﬁes Whitman’s condition then FSk(n) is bounded.

Whitman’s condition is a very strong condition which enables P. Whitman
and others to prove several structural results on free lattices, such as the well
known result that there exists an embedding F L(ω) ֒→ F L(3). However,
Whitman’s condition cannot be used for semidistributive varieties if there
are enough generators.

Proposition 6 Let n be a positive integer. Then FSn(6) does not satisfy
Whitman’s condition.

Proof :(Brian T. Chan) J´onsson and Keifer’s Theorem on lattices satisfying
Whitman’s condition implies that if a lattice L satisﬁes Whitman’s condition
then F L(3) ֒→ L or the breadth of L is at most four (see [11] and [3] for more
on this result and its implications). Suppose that FSn(6) satisﬁes Whitman’s
condition. Since F L(3) /∈ Sn, it follows that the breadth of FSn(6) is at
most four. As observed in [3], all breadth four lattices satisfy the following
equational identity:

15

(1) x ∧ W5

i=1 xi = W5

i=1(x ∧ Wj6=i xj)

Let B be the 32 element boolean algebra B = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 and
let B′ be obtained from B by adding an extra element x to B such that
(0, 1, 1, 1, 1) < x < (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). Since x is doubly irreducible and B is
distributive, it can be checked that B′ does not have a sublattice isomorphic
to L11 or to L12. So by J.G. Lee’s characterization of ﬁnite neardistributive
lattices (see [4]), B′ is neardistributive.

Hence, the fact that B′ is generated by six elements implies that there
is an onto homomorphism FSn(6) → B′. This implies that B′ satisﬁes (1).
But that is impossible since (1) fails in B′ for x as deﬁned in B′, x1 =
(1, 0, 0, 0, 0), x2 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0), . . . , x5 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1). (cid:3)

We now see how the new proofs for F. Galvin and B. J´onsson’s work can

possibly be extended in another way.

3 Spanning Pairs and Finite Width Sublat-

tices of Free Lattices

The width of a lattice is the supremum of the cardinalities of all antichains
in that lattice.
In particular, a ﬁnite width lattice is a lattice such that
for some positive integer k, every antichain has cardinality at most k. The
machinery used in Section 1.1 reduced the number of possible cases to con-
sider when analysing distributive sublattices. However, the machinery used
in Section 1.2 is related to how distributive sublattices of free lattices can be
constructed. We consider the following idea: A subset C ⊆ L of a lattice L
is convex if for all p, q, r ∈ L, p, q ∈ C and p ≤ r ≤ q implies r ∈ C. We
introduce A. Day’s doubling construction following [3]:

Deﬁnition 3 (A. Day’s Doubling Construction) Let L be a lattice and
C be a convex subset of L. Deﬁne L[C] to be the disjoint union (L\C)∪(C×2)
with p ≤ q if one of the following holds.

(1) p, q ∈ L\C and p ≤ q holds in L

(2) p, q ∈ C × 2 and p ≤ q holds in C × 2

16

(3) p ∈ L\C, q = (u, i) ∈ I × 2, and p ≤ u holds in L

(4) p = (v, i) ∈ C × 2, q ∈ L\C, and v ≤ q holds in L.

Such a construction is an interval doubling construction if C is assumed
to be an interval: with p ≤ q in L, C = {r ∈ L : p ≤ r ≤ q}. As evident in
Theorem 1, all distributive sublattices of free lattices can be constructed from
a countable chain by repeatedly applying A. Day’s doubling construction.
This idea also applies to ﬁnite sublattices of free lattices: A result from
A. Day (see [8], [4], and [3]) implies that every ﬁnite sublattice of a free
lattice can be constructed from a one element lattice by repeatedly applying
A. Day’s interval doubling construction. I will prove a result which restricts
how A.Day’s doubling construction can be used for sublattices of free lattices
by introducing the notion of a spanning pair. We write p ≺ q to mean that
q covers p (this means that if p ≤ r ≤ q then r = p or r = q.)

Deﬁnition 4 Let L be a lattice with no minimal element or maximal ele-
ment. A spanning pair |p, q| consists of two elements p ≺ q in L and two
sequences p < p1 < p2 < . . . and q > q1 > q2 > . . . in L such that q (cid:2) pm
for all m, p (cid:3) qn for all n, and for all r ∈ L, r (cid:3) pm and r (cid:2) qm for some
m and n. We say that a spanning pair |p, q| is induced by (p, q).

If L is a lattice, C is a convex subset of L then it is not hard to see that
a necessary condition for the lattice L[C] to satisfy Whitman’s condition is
the following: Every element of C that is not maximal or minimal in C is
doubly irreducible in C. In particular, if |p, q| is a spanning pair of L[C],
L[C] satisﬁes Whitman’s condition, and, for some c ∈ C, p = (0, c) and
q = (1, c) then C is a chain. This observation can be carried further. Below
I will create and prove Theorem 4 which only assumes that a lattice has no
doubly reducible elements.

Theorem 4 Let L be a lattice with no doubly reducible elements. If there
is a spanning pair |p, q| of L, a lattice L′, a convex subset C of L′, and an
isomorphism f : L → L′[C] such that f (p) = (0, c) and f (q) = (1, c) for
some c ∈ C, then L ∼= 2 × Z for some chain Z.

Proof :(Brian T. Chan) Let |p, q| be a spanning pair as speciﬁed in The-
orem 4. Then it can be checked that there is an embedding h : 2 × Z → L
such that h((0, 0)) = p, h((1, 0)) = q, and h((0, k)) ≺ h((1, k)) for all integers

17

k. Let r ∈ L\h(2 × Z). For convenience, we write h(2 × Z) as 2 × Z.

Case 1: (0, m) < r < (1, n) for some integers m ≤ n, since |p, q| is a span-
ning pair as described in the theorem it follows that r ≤ (0, n) or (1, m) ≤ r.

Case 2: (1, n) < r < (1, n+1) for some integer n. Since (1, n)∨(0, n+1) =
r ∨ (0, n + 1) = (1, n + 1), consider the gadget GL((0, n + 1); (1, n), r) and the
duals of the lattices in Figure 4. It can be seen that the sublattice of L gen-
erated by (2×Z)∪{r} is isomorphic to 2×Z and that (r∧(0, n+1)) ≺ r in L.

Case 3: (1, m) < r < (1, n) and r k (1, i) for some integers m < i < n.
The lattice L has no doubly reducible elements so (1, m) < r ∧ (1, i). As
in Case 2, r ∧ (1, i) is join reducible; but then r ∧ (1, i) is doubly reducible,
contrary to assumption.

Case 4: r (cid:2) (1, k) for all integers k and (1, m) ≤ r∧(1, n) < (1, n) for some
integer m and some integer n satisfying n ≥ m + 2. If (1, k) < r ∧ (1, n) <
(1, k + 1) for some m ≤ k < n, then using Case 2 on r ∧ (1, n) leads to a
contradiction; if (1, k) < r ∧ (1, n) < (1, k + 2) and (r ∧ (1, n)) k (1, k + 1) for
some m ≤ k < n, then using Case 3 on r ∧ (1, n) leads to a contradiction.
Otherwise, r ∧ (1, n) is doubly reducible contrary to assumption.

Case 5: For some integer n, r < (1, n), r k (0, n), and r (cid:3) (1, m) for all
m < n. Then consider s = r ∧ (0, n) < r. By Case 1, it is impossible for
(0, k) ≤ s for some k ≤ n. So analysing s dually to how r was analysed in
Case 3 and Case 4 leads to another contradiction.

Case 6: Pick an integer n and consider s = r ∨ (1, n). Then as s /∈ 2 × Z
and s (cid:2) (1, k) for all integers k, analysing s in the same way that r was
analysed in Case 3 and Case 4 leads to another contradiction.

Hence, the sublattice of L generated by (2 × Z) ∪ {r} is isomorphic to
2 × Z. The theorem now follows in the case when L is countable. When L is
uncountable, the theorem follows by transﬁnite induction; the details of such
a proof can be seen from the proof in Section 1.2 of this paper of Proposition
3. This completes the proof. (cid:3)

Hence, for lattices not isomorphic to 2 × Z for some chain Z, spanning
pairs give a way of identifying where A. Day’s doubling construction cannot

18

be used. It would be nice if there were a way to more easily recognize where
such spanning pairs may appear. For this, I will create and prove Theorem
5.

Theorem 5 Let L be a semidistributive lattice and assume that there exists
a positive integer N such that: if A is an antichain of L where every element
of A is join reducible or meet reducible, then |A| ≤ N. Then if |p, q| is a
spanning pair, there exists a lattice embedding f : 2 × Z → L such that
p = f (0, 0), q = f (0, 1), and f (0, k) ≺ f (1, k) in L for all k ∈ Z. Moreover,
if r ∈ L\f (2 × Z), then (0, m) < r < (1, n) for some integers m ≤ n implies
that r ≤ (0, n) or (1, m) ≤ r.

Proof : (Brian T. Chan) Let |p, q| be a spanning pair of L with p < p1 <
p2 < . . . and q > q1 > q2 > . . . Because |p, q| is a spanning pair, we can
deﬁne the following subsequence of p < p1 < p2 < . . . :

Let pn1 = p1, and for all positive integers k, let pnk+1 satisfy q ∨ pnk < q ∨
pnk+1. Dually, deﬁne a subsequence q > qn1 > qn2 > . . . of q > q1 > q2 > . . .
in the same way that p < pn1 < pn2 < . . . was deﬁned. Then set p′
k = pnk
and q′

k = qnk for all positive integers k. Now we show (1):

(1) There exists an integer k and an element p′′

1 such that

pnk ≤ p′′

1 ≺ q ∨ pnk.

2 < r1 ∨ p′

3 < . . . . Set p1,n = p′

n < q ∨ p′

n for all n ≥ 2. Set p2,n = r1 ∨ p′

2 ≺ q ∨ p′
2 = p2,2 < r2 < q ∨ p′

Suppose that there is an element r1 which satisﬁes p′

1 < r1 < q ∨ p′
1.
We ﬁrst note that r1 < r1 ∨ p′
n. Since
p ≺ q, p ∧ r = p ∧ p1,n for all n ≥ 2. So by the meet semidistributive laws,
p′
n < r1 ∨ p′
If
r1 ∨ p′
2, then we are done proving (1). Otherwise, let r2 satisfy
r1 ∨ p′
4 < . . . and the
meet semidistributive laws combined with the fact that p ≺ q imply that for
all n ≥ 3, r1 ∨ p′
n for n ≥ 3.
Since (1) is assumed to be false, this procedure can be continued indeﬁnitely.
But then there is a sequence of antichains A1, A2, A3, . . . in L such that for
all k, |Ak| = k and every element of Ak is join reducible; this is contrary to
assumption.

2. Like before, r2 < r2 ∨ p′

n = p2,n < r2 ∨ p′

n < q ∨ p′

n. Set p3,n = r2 ∨ p′

n for n ≥ 2.

3 < r2 ∨ p′

19

Hence, (1) is true. Using assertion (1) indeﬁnitely, we obtain the chain
2 < . . . Dually, we use the join semidistributive laws and the as-
2 > . . . In the result-
k for all positive inte-
2, . . . }∪{q, q′′
2 , . . . }

p < p′′
sumption that L has ﬁnite width to construct q > q′′
ing structure we have that p′′
k and that p∧q′′
gers k. Hence, the sublattice of L generated by {p, p′′
is isomorphic to 2 × Z. We denote this sublattice by 2 × Z.

k ≺ q∨p′′

1 < p′′

1 > q′′
k ≺ q′′
1, p′′

1, q′′

To prove the last part of the theorem, let r ∈ L\(2 × Z) and suppose
that (0, m) < r < (1, n) for some integers m ≤ n where (1, m) (cid:2) r and
r (cid:2) (0, n). Since (0, n) ≺ (1, n) in L, (1, m − 1) ∧ r = (1, m − 1) ∧ (0, n) <
(1, m−1)∧(r ∨(0, n)) which contradicts the fact that L join semidistributive.
This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

One application of the developments is as follows. It appears that The-
orem 4 and Theorem 5 combined with A. Day’s characterization of ﬁnite
bounded lattices could be useful for describing ﬁnite width sublattices of
free lattices. All sublattices of a free lattice are semidistributive and satisfy
Whitman’s condition; and a lattice which satisﬁes Whitman’s condition has
no doubly reducible elements. Moreover, in a ﬁnite width lattice there is a
positive integer N such that every antichain has cardinality at most N.

It is hoped that the work done in this paper may lead to new ways of at-
tacking the following open problem: Which countable lattices are isomorphic
to a sublattice of a free lattice? Concluding this paper, we quote J. Reinhold
from [6]: we are still far away from a characterization of arbitrary sublattices
of free lattices.
