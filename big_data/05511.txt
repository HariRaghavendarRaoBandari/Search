CHARACTER RELATIONS AND REPLICATION IDENTITIES IN

2D CONFORMAL FIELD THEORY

P. BANTAY

Abstract. We study replication identities satisﬁed by conformal characters
of a 2D CFT, providing a natural framework for a physics interpretation of
the famous Hauptmodul property of Monstrous Moonshine, and illustrate the
underlying ideas in simple cases.

1. Introduction

The remarkable interaction between mathematics and physics around the turn
of the century has been to a large part spurred by the new mathematical struc-
tures underlying String Theory [22, 26], leading to such interesting new mathemat-
ical concepts as Vertex Operator Algebras [10, 19] and Modular Tensor Categories
[30, 1]. These developments in turn were strongly inﬂuenced by Monstrous Moon-
shine [28, 27, 13], the amazing connection between the representation theory of
the Monster M, the largest sporadic ﬁnite simple group, with the classical theory
of modular forms. Actually, VOA theory grew out from the need to provide a
conceptual explanation of Moonshine.

It has been recognized pretty early [16] that, to a large extent, the Moonshine
conjectures ﬁnd a natural physics explanation by interpreting the relevant quanti-
ties as describing string propagation in a suitable (rather exotic) background, the
Moonshine orbifold, obtained as the result of orbifolding [17] the Moonshine mod-
ule by the Monster. From this point of view, many strange-looking properties [25]
of the Thompson-McKay series involved in Moonshine follow from general phys-
ical principles, with one notable exception: the so-called Hauptmodul property,
which states (roughly speaking) that Thompson-McKay series generate the ﬁeld of
meromorphic functions of suitable genus zero Riemann surfaces, does not ﬁnd any
obvious interpretation from a physics perspective [20].

There has been several attempts to remedy this situation and ﬁnd a physics
explanation of the Hauptmodul property, see e.g. [29], but none proposed to this
date seems completely satisfactory. The aim of the present paper is to present
a new approach to the problem, based on the notion of character relations and
replication identities, which generalizes to arbitrary 2D Conformal Field Theories
[9, 18], and which provides an equivalent formulation of the Hauptmodul property in
the special case of the Moonshine orbifold. Roughly speaking, this approach relates
the Hauptmodul property to symmetries of second quantized string propagation [15]
on the Moonshine orbifold. While the precise nature of these symmetries is still
unclear (because identifying them would require a thorough analysis of the higher
symmetric products of the Moonshine orbifold, a pretty challenging task in view of

the intricate computations involved), the above identiﬁcation could prove to be a
ﬁrst step in a better understanding of the problem. That the above approach can be
made to work is demonstrated in the comparatively much simpler case of the Ising
model, where the analysis can be explicitly performed (at least for low degrees),
and the resulting replication identities related precisely to actual symmetries of
symmetric products.

2. Conformal characters, the modular representation and

character relations

Among the important characteristics of a 2D CFT [9, 18], a prominent role is
played by the conformal characters of the ’primaries’, the trace functions of irre-
ducible modules in the language of Vertex Operator Algebras. As a consequence
of conformal symmetry, the chiral symmetry algebra contains the Virasoro algebra,
whose zero mode L0 plays the role of (chiral) Hamiltonian. The commutation rules
of the Virasoro generators imply that, in each irreducible module separately, the
eigenvalues of L0 are integrally spaced, hence the spectrum of L0 can be character-
ized by specifying the lowest eigenvalue, called the conformal weight of the primary,
and the generating function of the eigenvalue multiplicities. For a primary p of con-
formal weight hp, the conformal character reads

(2.1)

χp(q) = q−c/24

dnqn+hp

∞

Xn=0

where dn denotes the multiplicity of n+hp as an eigenvalue of L0 and c the central
charge of the model. One can show that the above (fractional) power series is

absolutely convergent in the disk (cid:12)(cid:12)q(cid:12)(cid:12) < 1, hence deﬁnes an analytic function there.

Besides characterizing the spectrum of L0 in the irreducible modules, the confor-
mal characters also provide the basic building blocks of the torus partition function.
In the simplest case of diagonal theories, the torus partition function reads

(2.2)

Z(τ, τ ) =Xp (cid:12)(cid:12)χp(cid:0)e2iπτ(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

where τ denotes the modular parameter of the torus, and the sum runs over all
primaries; more generally, the torus partition function is a sesquilinear combination
of the conformal characters. Combining this observation with the invariance [12]
of the torus partition function under modular transformations i.e. transformations
of the modular parameter τ that do not change the conformal equivalence class,
one arrives at the conclusion that the modular group SL2(Z) is represented on the
linear span of the characters, i.e.

c d(cid:1) ∈ SL2(Z) there exists a unitary

representation matrix M = ρ(cid:0) a b

(2.3)

for any (cid:0) a b
c d(cid:1) such that
cτ +d(cid:19) =Xs
χp(cid:18) aτ +b

M psχs(τ )

Two remarks are in order here: ﬁrst, the modular representation is actually a
matrix representation, meaning that each individual modular matrix element has an
invariant meaning. This is particularly clear when considering Verlinde’s celebrated
formula [31] expressing the fusion rules of the theory in terms of modular matrix
elements, or its various generalizations [24, 6]. From a technical point of view, this

CHARACTER RELATIONS AND REPLICATION IDENTITIES IN 2D CFT

3

means that the linear space V aﬀording the modular representation comes equipped
with a distinguished basis B={bp} labeled by the primaries, and a diﬀerent choice
of basis would correspond to a diﬀerent theory.
The second observation is that the transformation rule Eq.(2.3) does not always
determine the modular representation matrices. The reason for this is that the
conformal characters, as functions of the modular parameter τ , are not necessarily
linearly independent, i.e. there may exist nontrivial relations of the form

(2.4)

Rpχp(τ ) = 0

Xp

with coeﬃcients Rp independent of τ . The existence of such nontrivial character re-
lations is actually pretty common, e.g. the characters of charge conjugate primaries
are automatically equal

(2.5)

χp(τ ) = χp(τ )

As a consequence of the character relations, the linear span W of the characters is
usually only a subspace of V , and the individual modular matrix elements cannot be
determined from Eq.(2.3), only suitable linear combinations of them. Actually, the
example of charge conjugation is a good indication for the origin of such character
relations: they are the reﬂections of (possibly hidden) global symmetries of the
theory1.

To illustrate this last point, let us consider the orbifold line of c = 1 theories [21].

Let’s restrict our attention to the models with even N . Since charge conjugation

is trivial in this case, the obvious character relations

(2.9)

φ− = φ+

σ− = σ+
τ− = τ+

must have a diﬀerent origin: they are a manifestation of the dihedral D4 symmetry
underlying these models [21], which follows from the fact that the orbifold line
may be obtained as the conformal limit of Ashkin-Teller models, i.e.
two Ising
spins coupled locally via their energy density. Clearly, the transformations that
ﬂip each Ising spin separately, together with the one that exchanges the two, form
a D4 symmetry group, explaining the above character relations.
In case N = 4
(corresponding to the 4-state Potts model) this symmetry is extended to a full S4,
resulting in the extra character relations

Eq.(2.9) get supplemented by

χ6 + χ10 = τ±

More generally, such extra character relations occur whenever N is the square of

The origin of these extra relations Eq.(2.12) may be traced back to the fact that the
corresponding models may be constructed as dihedral orbifolds of the compactiﬁed
boson at radius r = 1/√2 [21].

From a technical point of view, nontrivial character relations indicate that the
modular representation ρ is reducible.
Indeed, as a consequence of the τ inde-
pendence of the coeﬃcients Rp in Eq.(2.4), the linear span W of the characters
(considered as a subspace of V ) is invariant under ρ.
In particular, this means
that in order to fully characterize the modular properties of the characters, it is
not enough to specify the matrix representation ρ, but one should amend this by
a description of the invariant subspace W (e.g. by specifying a basis of it). For-
mally, one could think that this last step can be avoided by directly reducing the
modular representation to the invariant subspace W : after all, this subspace is the
linear span of the conformal characters, thus it contains all the physically relevant
information. But this is far from being true. For example, application of Verlinde’s
formula [31, 24], one of the cornerstones of the whole theory, necessitates the con-
sideration of the full modular representation, with all individual matrix elements.
Similarly, computation of Frobenius-Schur indicators [2], or the application of the
trace identities of [6] require the knowledge of each matrix element separately.

3. Symmetric products and replication identities

Consider a system made up of n identical subsystems, each described by the same
CFT C. The whole system will be still conformally invariant, described by the n-
fold tensor power of C, and any permutation of the identical subsystems will leave
the whole system invariant. Consequently, for any permutation group Ω < Sn of
degree n, one could consider the permutation orbifold3 C ≀ Ω obtained by orbifolding
the tensor power by the twist group Ω [23, 11, 3]. Because of the universal nature
of the action of Ω, all relevant quantities (like correlation and partition functions,
fusion rules, modular matrix elements, etc.) of C≀Ω may be expressed in terms of
the relevant quantities of C, namely as polynomial expressions of these quantities
evaluated on suitable n-sheeted covering surfaces of the world sheet, see [4, 5] for
details.
In particular, the conformal characters of the permutation orbifold are
completely determined by those of C and the twist group Ω [3]. We note that all
2An interesting consequence of Eq.(2.12) is that in this case the characters of the orbifold can
be expressed as linear combinations of the characters of the original theory, i.e. the compactiﬁed
boson at radius r = √2n.

3The origin of the wreath product notation for permutation orbifolds is explained in [3].

CHARACTER RELATIONS AND REPLICATION IDENTITIES IN 2D CFT

relevant relations can be subsumed under a general group theoretic construct, the
orbifold transform, described in detail in [8].

A particularly interesting case is when the twist group Ω is maximal, i.e. when
Ω is the full symmetric group Sn of degree n: the resulting permutation orbifold
C ≀ Sn is called the n-th symmetric product of C, and plays an important role in
the description of second quantized strings [15, 14, 7]. The analysis of symmetric
products is greatly simpliﬁed by the exponential identity [8], a general combinatorial
identity satisﬁed by the orbifold transform, which provides closed expressions for
the characteristic quantities of symmetric products.

According to the general theory [3], the conformal characters (evaluated at some
speciﬁc modulus τ ) of the n-fold symmetric product C ≀ Sn may be expressed as
polynomial expressions of the conformal characters of C evaluated on the diﬀerent n-
sheeted (unbranched) coverings of a torus with modulus τ . But all theses coverings
have genus 0, hence each connected component is itself a torus of modulus

(3.1)

aτ + b

d

for suitable non-negative integers a, b, d characterizing the relevant covering. The
precise form of the polynomial expressions is irrelevant at this point, the only thing
to note is that all possible coverings occur in the process. This means that a
character relation of the symmetric product C ≀ Sn is nothing but a polynomial
relation between quantities of the form

d (cid:19)
χp(cid:18)aτ + b

We shall call such relations replication identities, because in the speciﬁc case of
the Moonshine orbifold they yield precisely the replication formulas satisﬁed by the
generalized Thompson-McKay series. It should be emphasized that the above no-
tion of replication identities is pretty general, far from being conﬁned to derivatives
of the Moonshine module or to rational conformal models.

As explained in the previous section, character relations for a given CFT are
usually reﬂections of outer symmetries relating diﬀerent irreducible modules of the
chiral algebra. Consequently, one may view replication identities as an indication to
the existence of suitable symmetries of the higher symmetric products. To illustrate
the above ideas, let us consider the Ising model, i.e. the Virasoro minimal model
of central charge c = 1/2. In this case there are three primary ﬁelds, 0, ǫ and σ, of
respective conformal weights 0, 1/2 and 1/16, with conformal characters

These are prime examples of replication identities, involving values of characters
on diﬀerent covering surfaces. Consequently, they should be related to character
relations, and ultimately to symmetries of symmetric products of the Ising model.
Let’s see how this comes about!

According to the general theory [3], the 2-fold symmetric product of Ising has
central charge c = 1 (twice the central charge of the Ising model) and a total of

upon taking into account the expressions Eqs.(3.7). Clearly, these are equivalent to
the replication identities Eqs.(3.6), and we see that, indeed, the latter are nothing
but character relations for the second symmetric product. What remains to do is
to ﬁnd out which symmetries are responsible for this.

Since the full moduli space of c = 1 conformal models is known, it is a simple
matter to identify the second symmetric product of the Ising model: it lies on the
orbifold line at radius rorb = 2, i.e. at N = 8. Furthermore, it is an easy exercise to
identify the respective primary ﬁelds, in particular one gets

But, as explained in the previous section, this model exhibits a dihedral D4
symmetry as a consequence of its Ashkin-Teller origin, leading to the character
relations Eqs.(2.9), which, taking into account the ﬁeld identiﬁcations Eq.(3.10),
yield precisely Eqs.(3.8).
In this case the analysis of the relevant symmetries is
relatively easy thanks to the identiﬁcation of the symmetric product as an Ashkin-
Teller model, but the underlying idea should be clear.

The third symmetric product of Ising has central charge c = 3/2, and can be
identiﬁed with an isolated N = 1 superconformal model, which has a total of 49
primaries. This superconformal model has 9 independent character relations, but
it turns out that all of these follow from the replication identities (3.6). New repli-
cation identities could come from the character relations of the 4-fold symmetric
product: unfortunately, this latter model of central charge c = 2 has 171 diﬀer-
ent primary ﬁelds, with 59 independent relations between their characters, whose
connection to the symmetries of the model is far from being easy to determine.

4. outlook and conclusion

Trying to ﬁnd a physics explanation of the Hauptmodul property of Monstrous
Moonshine, we considered the question of character relations and replication iden-
tities in Conformal Field Theory. Character relations play an important role in
understanding the structure of speciﬁc models, and should be viewed as one of the

CHARACTER RELATIONS AND REPLICATION IDENTITIES IN 2D CFT

basic ingredients (besides the modular representation) to fully specify their modu-
lar properties. Ultimately, they can be traced back to suitable symmetries of the
given model. Replication identities are nothing but character relations for symmet-
ric products of the model under study, hence they should correspond to symmetries
of these symmetric products.

But the Hauptmodul property is a consequence of the replication identities
obeyed by the (generalized) Thompson-McKay series, i.e.
the characters of the
Moonshine orbifold. Based on this, we suggest that the Hauptmodul property is
a manifestation of the inherent symmetries of second quantized string propagation
on the Moonshine orbifold.

While the arguments leading to the above conclusion could seem straightforward,
the actual implementation, i.e. the identiﬁcation of the relevant symmetries might
be far from being simple. Even for the Ising model, the proliferation of character
relations in higher symmetric products makes the analysis pretty diﬃcult, and one
should expect even worse in more complicated cases like the Moonshine orbifold.
Nevertheless, we believe that further elaboration of these issues could lead to a
better understanding of the subject.
