Abstract

Traditionally, the formation of linguistic
conventions has been studied by agent-
based models (specially,
the Naming
Game) in which random pairs of agents
negotiate word-meaning associations at
each discrete time step. This paper pro-
poses a ﬁrst approximation to a novel
question: To what extent the negotiation of
word-meaning associations is inﬂuenced
by the order in which the individuals inter-
act? Automata Networks provide the ade-
quate mathematical framework to explore
this question. A theoretical result shows
that if all individuals are updated at the
same time a periodic behavior may appear.
Computer simulations suggest that on two-
dimensional lattices the typical features of
the formation of linguistic conventions are
recovered under random schemes that up-
date small fractions of the population at
the same time.

1 Introduction

To what extent on a population of language
users the formation of a linguistic convention
(the simplest version of a vocabulary) is inﬂu-
enced by the order in which the individuals in-
teract? Traditionally, the formation of conven-
tions has been studied within agent-based mod-
the Naming Game (Steels, 1995;
els, specially,
Steels, 1996; Baronchelli et al., 2006),
in which
random pairs of agents (one speaker, one hearer)
negotiate word-meaning associations at each dis-
crete time step. Naturally, in a more realistic sce-
nario at some time frame (for instance, at the same
minute) multiple unrelated communicative inter-
actions occur.

(AN)

Wolfram, 2002)

(von Neumann, 1966;
pro-
vide the adequate mathematical framework to
stress (1) the self-organized nature of the for-
mation of consensus on linguistic conventions
(Steels, 2011; Loreto et al., 2011) and (2)
the
inﬂuence of the order in which the individuals
interact on the consensus of the entire population.
AN are extremely simple models where each
vertex of a set of vertices (the network) evolves
following a local rule based on the states of
“nearby” vertices. At each time step the entire
set or a fraction of the set of vertices (even one
vertex) is updated.

The main purpose of the deﬁnition of an AN
model is twofold: (1) to reproduce the typical dy-
namics of the formation of linguistic conventions
(in particular, of the Naming Game); and (2) to
describe by computer simulations and theoretical
results the dynamics of consensus formation under
different orders of the communicative interactions.
The work is organized as follows. Section 2 ex-
plains basic notions and the local rules of the AN
model. The next section reports a convergence
result of the particular case where all individuals
update their languages at the same time. This is
followed by computer simulations focused on the
dynamics under four interaction orders. Finally,
a brief discussion about the relations between the
results and the formation of language is presented.

2 Automata Networks

The individuals are located on the vertices of
a connected, simple and undirected graph G =
(P, I), where P = {1, ..., n} is the set of vertices
(the population) and I = {1, ..., m} is the set of
edges. In order to constraint the communicative
interactions the neighborhood of the vertex u ∈ P
is deﬁned as the set Vu = {v ∈ P : (u, v) ∈ I}.
The vertex u uniquely interacts with its neighbors,

located on Vu.

A set of p words W is considered. Each individ-
ual is completely characterized by its state, which
evolves within communicative interactions. The
state associated to the individual u ∈ P is the pair
(Mu, xu), where Mu ⊆ W is the memory to store
words of u and xu ∈ Mu is a word that u con-
veys to its neighbors of Vu. The set of words con-
veyed by the neighbors of the vertex u is denoted
Wu = {xv : v ∈ Vu}. Since the formation of a
language is based only on local interactions, the
vertex u only accesses to the set Wu. In principle
it is reasonable to think that the vertex u plays the
role of “hearer” (it hears the words conveyed by
the neighbors of u), and the vertices of Vu play the
role of “speaker” (they convey words to the vertex
u). In general communicative interactions in the
AN model involve multiple speakers (the neigh-
bors) and one hearer (the central vertex).

The AN model is the tuple A = (G, Q, (fu :

u ∈ P ), φ), where

• Q is the set of all possible states of the ver-
tices (Q = P(W ) × W , where P(W ) means
the set of subsets of W );

• (fu : u ∈ P ) is the family of local rules. The
state of a given vertex u evolves taking into
account the states of its neighbors of Vu; and

• φ is a function, the updating scheme, that
gives the order in which the vertices are up-
dated. Four updating schemes are consid-
ered: the sequential scheme, where vertices
are updated one by one in a prescribed or-
der (a permutation of the set of vertices);
the fully-asynchronous scheme, where ver-
tices are updated one by one in an uniformly
at random order;
the synchronous scheme,
where all vertices are updated at the same
time; and the α-asynchronous scheme, where
each vertex is updated with probability α
(Fat`es, 2013). It is clear that α = 1 is equiv-
alent to the synchronous scheme.

A conﬁguration X(t) at t is the set of states
{(Mu(t), xu(t))}u∈P . The conﬁguration X(t+1)
at time step t + 1 is given by the application of
local rules {fu}u∈P to a subset of individuals de-
ﬁned by the updating scheme. There are two spe-
cial conﬁgurations: (1) a cycle (a ﬁnite periodic
set of conﬁgurations); (2) and a ﬁxed point (a con-
ﬁguration which is invariant under the application
of local rules).

3 Two actions based on the Naming

Game

To model the formation of consensus the local rule
involves two actions which update the state pair
(Mu, xu) of each vertex u ∈ P :

• the addition (A) updates Mu by adding

words; and

• the collapse (C) updates Mu by cancelling all

its words, except one of them.

Both actions arise from lateral inhibition strate-
gies proposed in the context of the Naming Game
(Steels, 1995; Steels, 2011).
The addition at-
tempts to increase the chance of future success-
ful interactions. The collapse is the result of lo-
cal consensus within interactions (the individu-
als remove the remaining words in “successful”
conversations). Two simple forms of these ac-
tions are considered. First, the individuals add all
the unknown words. This means that the vertex
u ∈ P adds any word (conveyed by its neighbors)
x ∈ Wu, so that x /∈ Mu. Second, in the case that
Wu ⊆ Mu (all received words belong to the mem-
ory), the constraints of the AN model impose the
deﬁnition of a mechanism that allows to discrimi-
nate between words. Indeed, the vertex u receives
one word from each neighbor of Vu. To assign dif-
ferent values to the words each agent is endowed
with an internal total order for the set of words
(equivalently, if we consider W ⊆ Z the agents
are endowed with the order <). The individuals
choose to collapse in the minimum word conveyed
in the neighborhood, that is, the minimum of the
set Wu.

4 Rules of the model

Suppose that at time step t the vertex u ∈ P
has been selected according to one of the updating
schemes. Wu is the set of all words conveyed by
the neighbors of the vertex u. Wu = Bu ∪ Nu,
where Bu = {xv | (v ∈ Vu) ∧ (xv ∈ Mu)}
(the set of known words) and Nu = {xv | (v ∈
Vu) ∧ (xv /∈ Mu)} (the set of unknown words).
The subset Bu ⊆ Wu contains the words con-
veyed by the neighbors which belong to the mem-
ory Mu. In contrast, Nu ⊆ Wu contains the words
of Wu which do not belong to Mu. The local rule
fu reads

fu = (cid:26) if ∅ 6= Nu,

if ∅ = Nu,

(A) (Mi ∪ Nu, xu)
(C) ({min(Bu)}, min(Bu))

The rule means that in the case that ∅ 6= Nu
(that is, if there are words of Wu that the ver-
tex u does not know) the memory Mu is updated
by adding the words of Nu.
In the other case
(∅ = Nu) the vertex u collapses its memory in
the minimum of the set Bu (Bu = Wu). Clearly,
the conveyed word xu eventually changes in col-
lapses.

In other words, eventual changes in the con-
veyed word occur in the collapse action associated
to even steps. Therefore, at the odd step t − 1 each
vertex has in its memory all the words conveyed
by its neighbors. So, the next even step t is the re-
sult of a collapse in the minimum word (conveyed
by its neighbors). As consequence, u ∈ P and
v ∈ Vu satisfy

5 A mathematical convergence result

This brief section comprises a convergence re-
sult of the synchronous dynamics.
The re-
sult needs the deﬁnition of an “energy” opera-
tor. This kind of approach has been very fruit-
ful within the AN framework (see, for example,
(Goles-Chacc et al., 1985)). The interest on an
“energy” functional arises from a physicist inter-
pretation. The energy measures the amount of lo-
cal unstability of the conﬁguration. To each vertex
u ∈ P it is assigned the sum of all pairs xu + xv,
where v ∈ Vu; summing this quantity over all ver-
tices deﬁnes the total energy of the conﬁguration
at that time. From an initial conﬁguration the en-
ergy will be not increasing over time.

Theorem 1 Consider a population of n individu-
als playing the automata model with the set of p
words W and the synchronous updating scheme.
Then, the automata converges to ﬁxed points or cy-
cles with period 2 in at most O(mp) steps, where
m is the number of edges of the graph G.
Proof 1 The initial condition has
the form
(({x1}, x1), . . . , ({xn}, xn)). Then, the “energy”
operator

E(t) = Xu∈P Xv∈Vu

(xu(t + 2) + xv(t + 2))

(1)

is non-increasing. To prove this fact, we will

show that any u ∈ P and v ∈ Vu satisfy

xu(t + 2) + xv(t + 2) ≤ xu(t) + xv(t)

(2)

In the ﬁrst place, we notice that at step t = 0
every vertex is associated to a different memory of
size 1, and every vertex is updated synchronously.
Then,

• even steps imply collapses; and

• odd steps imply additions

xu(t + 2) ≤ min{xv(t) : v ∈ Vu} ≤ xv(t)
xv(t + 2) ≤ min{xw(t) : w ∈ Vv} ≤ xu(t)

(3)
(4)

From the previous inequalities, we have that
xu(t + 2) + xv(t + 2) = xu(t) + xv(t) if and only
if for any u ∈ P and v ∈ Vu xu(t + 2) = xu(t)
and xv(t + 2) = xv(t) or xu(t + 2) = xv(t) and
xv(t + 2) = xu(t). In consequence, the dynam-
ics under synchronous scheme converges to ﬁxed
points or cycles of length 2.

6 Simulations

To explicitly describe the dynamics of
the
AN two macroscopic measures are deﬁned
(Baronchelli et al., 2006):
the total number of
words of the system,

nw(t) = Xu∈P

|Mu|

(5)

where |Mu| is the size of the memory Mu; and

the number of different words (or synonyms),

nd(t) = | [u∈P

Mu|

(6)

whereSu∈P Mu represents the union of all sets

Mu, u ∈ P .

The simulation protocol is deﬁned by the fol-
lowing elements. Averages of nw(t) and nd(t)
over 100 initial conditions where each vertex is as-
sociated to a different state of the form ({x}, x),
x ∈ W .
Then, nw(0) = nd(0) = n.

chronous, synchronous and α-asynchronous (with

mann neighborhood (four nearest neighbors) with

asynchronous schemes.

reproduce the typical behavior observed for
lattices
the Naming Game on low-dimensional
(Baronchelli et al., 2006), as shown in Fig.
2
(black lines). Indeed, the dynamics exhibits three
typical domains. First, since at the beginning the
individuals convey different words a very fast
increasing in nw(t) and a drastic decreasing in
nd(t) are observed. Then, a peak in the number
of words is reached, at nw(t) ∼ 3n. Finally, the
dynamics enters in a very slow convergence to the
consensus conﬁguration, where nw(t) = n and
nd(t) = 1. The convergence is reached at t ∼ 300
steps (only the ﬁrst 50 steps are showed).

The dynamics under sequential scheme presents
some remarkable aspects, as shown in Fig. 2 (red
depicted lines). The evolution of the number of
words reaches a very sharp peak of nw(t) ∼ 5n.

Figure 2: Evolution of nw(t) and nd(t) under
synchronous updating scheme. The population
is located on a n = 642 periodic lattice with Von
Neumann neighborhood (four nearest neighbors).
The simulations run 200 steps. (top) nw(t) versus
t. (bottom) nd(t) versus t. One step t means n
vertex updates. y-axis is normalized by n. Only
the ﬁrst 50 steps are showed. The dynamics for all
initial conditions leads to cycles of size 2.

This means that at the peak each individual knows
all the words conveyed by its neighbors (notice
that each vertex has four neighbors). Another in-
teresting feature of the dynamics is that after the
peak the dynamics reaches a local maximum at
t ∼ 3. This fact requires further mathematical ex-
planation.

Synchronous dynamics is exhibited in Fig. 3
(blue lines). Approximately after 50 time steps
(one step means that all individuals have been up-
dated) the dynamics enters in a periodic behavior
with cycles of length 2. Thereby, the number of
words nw(t) oscillates between n and 2n, whereas
nd(t) converges to 2. In fact, time steps that cor-
respond to even numbers (even steps) imply col-
lapses (nw(t) = n) and odd steps imply additions
(nw(t) = 2n). Small “ladder” steps in the de-
creasing evolution of nd(t) show that at odd times
only additions are allowed (and then the conveyed
words remain ﬁxed).

Figure 3: Evolution of nw(t) and nd(t) under
α-asynchronous updating scheme. The popula-
tion is located on a n = 642 periodic lattice with
Von Neumann neighborhood (four nearest neigh-
bors). The simulations run 200 steps. (top) nw(t)
versus t. (bottom) nd(t) versus t. α varies from
{0.1, 0.9}. x-axis is normalized by α and y-axis
is normalized by n. Only the ﬁrst 50 steps are
showed.

The dynamics under α-asynchronous scheme is
exhibited in Fig. 4. The two values of α (0.9 and
0.1) are related to previous observations. First, at
α = 0.9 the dynamics presents oscillations that
diminish over time until reach a ﬁnal consensus
ﬁxed point. Second, at α = 0.1 the dynamics
seems to reproduce the behavior observed for the
Naming Game on low-dimensional lattices (as the
fully-asynchronous scheme).

7 Conclusion

This short paper introduces a new theoretical
framework to study the development of linguis-
tic conventions, and in general, the formation and
evolution of language. Despite that the AN model
is an abstract approximation to the real problem,
the work discusses how on a population of individ-
uals endowed with simple cognitive mechanisms
language arises only from local interactions.

The work proposes two important elements to

be discussed:
(1) an alternative (mathematical)
framework for agent-based studies on language
formation; and (2) computer simulations suggest-
ing that on two-dimensional lattices the typical
features of the formation of linguistic conventions
(as in the Naming Game) are recovered under ran-
dom schemes that update small fractions of the
population at the same time (fully-asynchronous
and α-asynchronous, associated to α = 0.1).
