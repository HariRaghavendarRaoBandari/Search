We present a new perspective on gravitational lensing. We describe a new extension of the
weak lensing formalism capable of describing strongly lensed images. By integrating the non-linear
geodesic deviation equation, the ampliﬁcation matrix of weak lensing is generalised to a sum over
independent ampliﬁcation tensors of increasing rank. We show how an image distorted by a generic
lens may be constructed as a sum over ‘roulettes’, which are the natural curves associated with the
independent spin modes of the ampliﬁcation tensors. Highly distorted images can be constructed
even for large sources observed near or within the Einstein radius of a lens where the shear and
convergence are large. The amplitude of each roulette is formed from a sum over appropriate
derivatives of the lensing potential. Consequently, measuring these individual roulettes for images
around a lens gives a new way to reconstruct a strong lens mass distribution without requiring a lens
model. This formalism generalises the convergence, shear and ﬂexion of weak lensing to arbitrary
order, and provides a uniﬁed bridge between the strong and weak lensing regimes.

This overview paper is accompanied by a much more detailed Paper II, arXiv:1603.04652.

Introduction

Gravitational lensing is typically though of in two separate regimes – strong and weak. The theory of lensing is
formulated from integrating the geodesic deviation equation and forming the Jacobi map (see e.g., [1] for a review).
The Jacobi map has a corresponding ampliﬁcation matrix which contains the familiar shear and convergence. In the
weak lensing approximation, these are considered to be constants over a small image, and the Born approximation is
used whereby the light travels along a straight line. Weakly lensed arclets can be described by including ﬂexion, which
to a good approximation is the derivative of the ampliﬁcation matrix at the centre of the image [2, 3], and accurately
given by solving the the geodesic deviation at second-order in the deviation vector [4]. Strong lensing situations, on
the other hand, can be analysed by tracing families of geodesics around a given mass distribution, or by analysing
how the Jacobi map varies over a lens distribution [5]. This suﬀers from the drawback of requiring a fully 3D lens
model, whereas for weak lensing we only require the lensing potential at the centre of the image.

Here we present a new approach to the strong lensing regime, which keeps with the philosophy of the weak lensing
approach. The idea is to build up a family of higher-order maps, generalising the linear Jacobi, and second-order
Hessian maps [4], from which a complicated image can be formed by summing over these (constant) maps. We
therefore generalise the weak lensing convergence, shear and ﬂexion expansion to arbitrary order. This means that
an image can be constructed as a sum over curves of diﬀerent spins we refer to as roulettes, as they are formed from
curves generated by circles rolling on circles. In the case of a weak gravitational ﬁeld, the amplitudes of these are set
by the lensing potential and its derivatives at the centre of the image. More generally they are governed by derivates
of the optical tidal tensor integrated along the line of sight to the centre of the image. Consequently, we do not need
to know the lens distribution in total to form a large strongly lensed image, just the potential at the centre of the
image. Conversely, given a lensed image with good enough resolution one can in principle construct the projected lens
mass and its derivatives at the position of the image. This gives a new way to construct the lens mass distribution
without having to assume a model.

This paper is a highly condensed presentation of Paper II [6], and we refer there for derivations and further details.

Geodesic deviation and weak lensing theory

The starting point for the computation of the convergence and shear is from the geodesic deviation equation which

where we have identiﬁed the conventional ampliﬁcation matrix A in the middle. We use χ as the radial distance,
and the integral is along the past null cone from observer to the source. Here, χ∇A is an angular derivative on the

(5)

The trace and trace-free parts of the ampliﬁcation matrix give rise to the usual convergence (κ) and shear (γAB). In
the weak lensing regime, it is often assumed that κ and γAB are constant over an image, giving rise to a (de-)magniﬁed
and elliptically distorted image.

This derivation is based on the assumption that the deviation vector is inﬁnitesimal, as the GDE is derived under
this assumption. However, for large strongly lensed images this assumption is not appropriate, as null geodesics
from diﬀerent parts of a source are, in eﬀect, non-locally distorted. This means that the lensing potential will vary
appreciably over an image, and ξ is no longer ‘small’. Thus, the notion that shear, for example, elliptically distorts an
image applies only inﬁnitesimally. The next order correction beyond shear and convergence is usually termed ﬂexion,
and is accurate to O(ξ2) [2, 3]. Flexion can be approximately calculated by Taylor expanding the ampliﬁcation matrix
in the image plane, but the full derivation of ﬂexion is much more complicated [4], arising from a generalised GDE
known as the Bazanski equation [7–9], which is accurate to O(ξ2). Our aim in this work is to generalise this expansion
using in weak lensing to all orders – and hence make it work for strongly lensed images.

Non-linear geodesic deviation and higher-order lensing maps

The fully non-linear geodesic deviation equation is outstandingly complicated, given by the second derivative of
Synge’s world function, and its series expansion beyond second-order in ξ is equally horrendous – see [9]. As far as
gravitational lensing is concerned, however, the most important contributions arise from terms with the maximum
number of screen space derivatives of the metric potential, and therefore, the Riemann tensor, an approximation we
use throughout this work. In this approximation, the generalised GDE is relatively straightforward. Normally, when
deriving the GDE, we Taylor expand the connection around the tail of the vector ξ, and stop at O(∂Γ). However,
this can be extended to higher derivatives of the connection, as this is just the ﬁrst term in a series expansion.
Consequently, we can replace the optical tidal tensor in (1) by

Note that there is no assumption about the spacetime in doing this perturbation expansion. The initial conditions at
the observer are

Here ζ is the non-perturbative angle in the image plane at the observer. At ﬁrst order the solution is (3) which gives
the physical distance between two rays at the source to ﬁrst order given the (exact) observed angular position between
the two rays, ζ. At each order we can solve (9) to give the m’th-order map, for m ≥ 2,

Here K is the reciprocal Jacobi map, deﬁned to have zero derivative at the observer. The method to ﬁnd this solution
from (9) is presented in [4]. This family of maps are written in the conventional way whereby ζ is in the image plane
(i.e., the angular separation between two observed rays) is mapped to ξ in the source plane (the physical distance
between the same two rays at emission) – we follow [11]. For m = 1 we write JAB = M(cid:38)
AB, noting that the Jacobi
map is deﬁned in this way. Adding up the ξ(m)’s for an observed deviation angle ζ will give the physical position of
the source element, assuming the maps are known.
These generalised Jacobi maps are for a generic optical tidal tensor R, suitable for most spacetimes and situations.
Specialising to the case of perturbations about ﬂat space, the generic image-to-source map is (for m ≥ 2)

Spin roulettes

What does a map at each order do? To analyse this, we have to split the map into its normal modes, or spin degrees
of freedom. This can be done by separating the tensor into its trace and trace-free parts. Each trace-free tensor then
is an independent spin mode (in general, but they are not independent in the weak ﬁeld regime). The derivation is a
bit involved, but the projected map can be invariantly decomposed using coordinates in the screen space such that
ζ = r cos θ ex + r sin θ ey. For the m’th map we write the ampliﬁcation tensor as a sum over independent spin modes

When acting on p(s), the rotation matrices I and ε lower the spin by 1, and the reﬂection matrices R− and R/ raise
it by 1. Thus each term in the sum in (14) has spin s. (The same expansion in the helicity basis is given in Paper II.)
The action on a unit circle is shown in Fig. 1. In general there is a family of odd modes alongside these, but these
are zero in the weak ﬁeld approximation, where only the highest derivatives of the potential are kept.

The thin lens approximation

We can illustrate how these roulettes form a complete image in the thin lens approximation. We shall use Cartesian
X, Y coordinates centred on the lens in the lens plane, at distance χL from the observer, with the distance from
X 2 + Y 2 (cid:39) χLϑ, where ϑ is the angle at the observer from the centre of the lens. (For a circularly

To illustrate the how a strongly lensed image can be constructed, let us consider an idealised circular lens, a
singular isothermal sphere with potential [10] ψ = RER/χ2
L, where RE is the Einstein radius of the lens. From this,
we calculate the individual roulette amplitudes, and add up the series of terms to a given m. For an isothermal sphere,
if m is even (odd) all the non-zero spin modes are odd (even). So, for example, maps which have m odd have a spin-0
mode. This series over s and m gives ξ ∼ (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) as a rather messy formula for the points in the source plane which
map to points ζ = (x, y) = r(cos θ, sin θ) in the image plane. Consider for example a source with a Gaussian intensity
proﬁle I = e−(x(cid:48) 2+y(cid:48) 2)/2σ2
. Given that x(cid:48) = x(cid:48)(r, θ) and y(cid:48) = y(cid:48)(r, θ), the level surfaces of I, which are circles in the
source plane, will give the observed curves in the (x, y) image plane.

FIG. 2: A circular isothermal lens, showing how the series of roulettes sums to give a complete primary image when added in
diﬀerent ways. The source is shown on the left and the magniﬁed image on the right (calculated with m = 25) – these are
shown to scale, with the Einstein radius of the lens shown for reference. In the top row we ﬁx the maximum m used, and add
up all the possible spins up to s = m + 1. In the bottom row we add up all possible spins up to the maximum shown for m (cid:29) s.
Note how poorly the convergence shear and ﬂexion approximate the true image.

We consider in Fig. 2 how a complete image is formed for such a Gaussian proﬁle. We illustrate this adding up the
modes in two diﬀerent ways. In the top row we add up to a ﬁxed m shown, including all the spin modes up to that
order – this is the natural way to add up the modes as each mode contributes a factor of RE/R less. So, for m = 1,
we include the shear and convergence, and for m = 2 we add in the ﬂexion, and so on. Near the centre of the image
this is reasonably accurate, but far from it it is far from it. We also see spurious images appearing in a circle around
the centre of the image – these appear at the edge of the radius of convergence of the series (note we have removed
some of these for clarity). For large m we recover the exact image, with a circle of spurious images.

However, this is not the only way to order the series. It is also instructive to add in each spin type one at a time –
we show this in the second row. We ﬁx m = 25, and add up all the spin-0 modes, then the spin-1 modes and so on,
until the same complete image is constructed. The images and circle of spurious images are rather diﬀerent. The ﬁnal
image shown on the right corresponds to that found by using the exact solution directly.

Note that only a single image is reconstructed in this example, with the same location as the ‘unlensed source’
position – this is a bit like using the Born approximation. We specify the point where the centre of the image is seen,
not where the source is. In general, all images within the radius of convergence of the series will be reconstructed
with this prescription. Images within the Einstein radius of the lens can also be accurately made – an example is
presented in Fig. 3.

and so on. This illustrates how, once the amplitudes µm
s are known, the mass and its derivatives can be found. A set
of consistency conditions exists between the higher-order roulettes. For a non-symmetric potential, the expressions
are more complicated, but the principle remains.

Conclusions

We have presented a new formalism for describing large lensed images. The key idea is to extend the normal
weak lensing convergence, shear and ﬂexion to all orders so that, in principle, very complicated images can be
reconstructed. This results, under the approximations we have made, in a 2D Fourier series expansion over curves
which are all roulettes (epitrochoids plus hypotrochoids) of increasing spin. Adding up suﬃciently many roulettes
allows for a complete reconstruction of the image. In Paper II we show that analytic continuation of the series works
for a point mass, and it would be interesting to extend this to more general lenses. The amplitude of each roulette
depends directly on derivatives of the lensing potential, which oﬀers a new method for the mass reconstruction of a
lens. Consistency conditions between diﬀerent roulette amplitudes could be used to help identify strong lenses. More
generally it will be interesting to see how to construct estimators for the roulette amplitudes, and to see how this
technique can be put into useful practise.
