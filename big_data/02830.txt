Tunable spin correlations are found to arise between two neighboring trapped exciton-polariton
condensates which spin-polarize spontaneously. We observe a crossover from an antiferromagnetic-
to a ferromagnetic pair state by reducing the coupling barrier in real-time using control of the
imprinted pattern of pump light. Fast optical switching of both condensates is then achieved by
resonantly but weakly triggering only a single condensate. These eﬀects can be explained as the
competition between spin bifurcations and spin-preserving Josephson coupling between the two
condensates, and open the way to polariton Bose-Hubbard ladders.

The development of spin-charge lattice models for un-
derstanding strongly-correlated states of matter is a suc-
cessful theme of modern quantum physics. This has
driven the desire to model and probe complex condensed
matter phenomena using highly-controlled systems, such
as ultracold atoms [1], photons [2, 3], or superconduct-
ing junctions [4]. Exciton-polariton (polariton) lattices
have emerged as an alternative system [5, 6] with unique
properties. Due to their strongly dissipative and nonlin-
ear nature, many-body polariton gases can reach steady
states which are remarkably diﬀerent from their equilib-
rium case [7]. Moreover, they have peculiar spin proper-
ties [8–10] and exhibit spontaneous magnetization (emit-
ting circularly polarized light) above a critical bifurcation
threshold [11], analogous to the weak lasing regime [12].
In this Letter we study the basic building block of a po-
lariton spin lattice: two optically trapped spin-polarized
condensates which are tunably coupled. We demonstrate
that trapped out-of-equilibrium polariton condensates
can exhibit Ising-like behavior related to spin bifurca-
tions. The two condensate system investigated here is
shown to correspond to one plaquette of a bosonic lad-
der [13], and allows demonstration of a crossover in the
competition between Josephson coupling and spin bifur-
cation. These features have not been seen in any other
system to date.

and nonlinear nature of polariton condensates makes

than that in the conventional Ising case,
leading to
exotic forms of magnetism where the orientation and
strength of coupling is not determined by the sign of the
interaction.

We achieve tuning between ferromagnetic (F) or anti-
ferromagnetic (AF) coupling by directly modulating the
tunneling barrier, adjusting either the height of the bar-
rier or the separation between the condensates. We show

sate results in fast switching of the state of the neigh-
boring condensate. Our result is a key step towards us-
ing trapped polariton condensates for the realization of
interacting bosons in a driven-dissipative spinor Bose-
Hubbard model [5, 7].

The Bose-Hubbard model with polaritons can be stud-
ied in other systems where, for example, the sample is
etched to form micro-pillar arrays [6, 10, 24], metal ﬁlms
are deposited on the surface of the cavity [21, 25, 26],
or surface acoustic waves are applied [27]. While the
conﬁnement potential is then separate from the conden-
sate gain, the trapped exciton-polaritons studied in the
present letter have the advantage that the conﬁnement,
even at a single site level, is versatile and can be ad-
justed on the ﬂy. Particularly for larger arrays of con-
densates, this capability to tune the diﬀerent barriers is
vital. Moreover, the interaction with the reservoir parti-
cles is reduced, crucial for spin stability.

(polaritons)

Exciton-polaritons

are quasiparticles
formed by the strong coupling of excitons in semicon-
ductor quantum wells with photons in the microcavity
in which they are embedded [28]. We create optically
trapped polariton condensates [20, 29, 30] by nonreso-
nant linearly-polarized continuous wave (CW) excitation
of a membrane microcavity (for details see SI. 1). Driven
by their repulsive excitonic interactions, polaritons travel
away from the pump region and feed the zero-momentum
ground state at the center of the optical trap. Once the
density exceeds the condensation threshold, a macroscop-
ically coherent condensate forms in the trap center. Po-
laritons in quantum-well microcavities have two ±1 (spin
up or down) projections of their total angular momen-
tum along the structure growth axis, which correspond
to right- and left-circularly polarized photons emitted by
the cavity (of intensities i±).

Trapped polariton condensates spontaneously exhibit
a high degree of circular polarization, or magnetization
M = sz = (i+ − i−)/(i+ + i−), above a critical spin-
bifurcation threshold as a result of energy and dissipation
splitting of their linear polarizations [11]. We operate
above this spin-bifurcation threshold, which means that
the trapped condensate is spin-polarized in either spin-up
|↑(cid:105) or spin-down |↓(cid:105) states. These spin-polarized conden-
sates emit nearly circularly polarized (|M| >85%) light,
which can be measured using conventional polarimetry.
In each realization we excite the sample for 200 µs and
measure the condensate Mn(t), where n ∈ {1, 2} denotes
the left and right condensate (see SI. 2). The optical
excitation is patterned using a spatial light modulator
(SLM) into the shape of a double-hexagon as shown by
dashed circles in Fig. 1(b-d) such that a spin-polarized
condensate is formed at the center of each hexagon. The
middle ‘barrier’ pump spots [orange in Fig. 1(b)] between
the two traps are weaker than the outer spots (intensity
ratio (cid:39) 75%) to allow inter-trap tunneling of polaritons.
We can spatially squeeze or stretch the traps and
change the condensates separation without changing the

barrier pump intensity. To achieve this the barrier pump
spots of the double-hexagon trap are ﬁxed while shifting
the location of the other spots. When the separation of
the condensates maxima is greater than (cid:96)c = 13.6 µm,
the two condensates independently pick a spin-up or
spin-down state. However, when this is decreased to
(cid:96) = 0.90(cid:96)c, we observe AF coupling, where the conden-
sates spontaneously collapse into either |↑↓(cid:105) or |↓↑(cid:105) states
in each realization [Fig. 1(c), see also SI. 2]. Further de-
creasing the separation to 0.74(cid:96)c, we observe F coupling
where the condensates pick either of |↑↑(cid:105) or |↓↓(cid:105) states
randomly in each realization [Fig. 1(d)]. As in the case
of a single condensate [11], these states remain stable for
many seconds at 5 K, and do not depend on the position
on the sample, the geometrical pattern of the pump spots
or the power above the spin-bifurcation threshold.

For each set of trapping conditions, 1000 realiza-
tions are created and for each we measure M for the
two condensates to perform a statistical analysis of the
condensate-pair spin correlation.
Each polarization-
resolved realization is recorded for 200 µs by a camera,
allowing us to map the 2D histogram of (M1, M2) and
resolving F and AF situations (Fig. 2). Absolute corre-
lations of |C| > 0.99 are found for the condensate spins
in both coupling regimes. Increasing the condensate sep-
aration to (cid:96)c reduces this correlation to 0.09, conﬁrming
that condensate spins then become uncoupled. It is im-
portant to note that we observe partial phase coherence
between the condensates in both AF and F regimes, and
the condensates are at equal energies (see SI. 3).

To accurately map the magnetic phase diagram of the
system the inﬂuence of barrier on condensate spin cor-
relation is investigated.
Instead of changing the sepa-
ration of the condensates by changing the trap geom-
etry, we vary their barrier potential. For this the in-
tensity of the barrier pump spots [orange, Fig. 1(a)] is
changed. This allows ﬁner control over the coupling in-
teraction than changing the separation of the conden-
sates, which is discretized due to single-pixel shifting of
the SLM. To better observe the correlations, we induce
spin ﬂips by increasing the spin noise via spatially broad-
ening the pump spots, which increases the overlap of the
condensates and the pump. This increases the sponta-
neous spin-ﬂip rate of the condensates (here set to ∼10

ﬂips/µs, see also SI. 4), allowing faster and more reliable
correlation measurements within the stability time of our
setup. Since the energy blueshift from pump-injected ex-
citons is proportional to the pump intensity [29], the ratio
of the intensity of barrier pump spots to the other spots,
ur, is a reliable measure of the relative barrier height.
The blueshift above the condensate energy at the saddle
point of the barrier is urU0, where U0 (cid:39) 200 µeV (see also
SI. 3). Selecting the right-circularly polarized (σ+) emis-
sion, we spatially resolve the left and right condensates
recording their intensities at each ur for 2 ms using photo-
multipliers. A typical trace for ur = 0.8 [Fig. 3(a)] shows
that the double condensates ﬂip randomly between the
two AF states with a switching time limited by our mea-
surement resolution (∼5 ns). Reducing ur to 0.65 shows
now ﬂipping between two F-states [Fig. 3(b)]. For each
barrier potential we record 20 traces (each lasting 75 µs)
and calculate the average correlation of the condensates
spins, plotting this as a function of ur [Fig. 3(c)]. We
observe a clear transition from the ferromagnetic to an-
tiferromagnetic state at ur (cid:39) 0.72. Increasing ur further
results in zero coupling.
The uncoupling of the condensates when increasing
their separation (cid:96)/(cid:96)c = 0.9 → 1.0 (while the intensity
of the shared pump spots remains constant) implies that
the shared reservoir between two condensates does not
play a signiﬁcant role here. Our trapped condensates
form with ¯k=0 (∆k = 0.4 rad/µm), where the transverse-
electric and transverse-magnetic splitting vanishes [31].
As a result the optical spin-Hall eﬀect [32] is negligi-
ble in trapped condensates, with spin torque rates much
smaller than tunnelling rates thus preserving spin during
the Josephson process [33]. On the other hand, observa-
tion of phase coherence between the condensates signiﬁes
that the spin coupling must be mediated by a coherent
mechanism, as described by our theory below.

Our description of above eﬀects is based on the theory
for a single trapped condensate [11], which is extended
to include the Josephson coupling [34–36] between the
two condensates. The order parameter for each exciton-

polariton condensate is a two-component complex vector
Ψn = [ψn+, ψn−]T and ψn+ and ψn− are the spin-up and
spin-down wave functions. The components of the order
parameter deﬁne the measurable condensate pseudospin
n · σ · Ψn), and the normalized spin vector
Sn = (1/2)(Ψ†
ˆsn = Sn/Sn, where σx,y,z are the Pauli matrices. The or-
der parameters evolve according to the driven dissipative

Here g(Sn) = Γ − W + ηSn is the pumping-dissipation
balance, Γ is the (average) dissipation rate, W is the in-
coherent in-scattering (or ‘harvest’ rate), and η captures
the gain-saturation term [37]. This gain saturation de-
pends on the total occupation of the condensate (treated
more generally in Ref. [11]). X (horizontal) and Y (verti-
cal) linearly-polarized single-polariton states are split in
energy by ε and dissipation rate by γ. The repulsive in-
teraction constant for polaritons with the same spin is α1,
and the interaction constant for polaritons with opposite
spins is α2. Finally, J > 0 is the extrinsic spin-preserving
Josephson coupling between the left and the right con-
densate, which we have introduced here to account for
coherent coupling.

It is important to note the fundamental diﬀerences be-
tween the spin coupling mechanism demonstrated here
and that seen in closed systems such as atoms trapped
in optical lattices [38, 39]. In equilibrium spin systems
such as those described by the Ising model, the coupling
is achieved via the minimization of the total energy. In
the driven-dissipative system described here, the mini-
mization of energy does not play a direct role since the
system is out of equilibrium. Here the spin alignment
is a direct result of spin bifurcation correlation, which
itself is a product of pumping, dissipation and nonlinear-
ity, and coherent exchange of particles between the two

We perform dynamical simulations to calculate spin
correlations. We calculate the steady state of the cou-
pled Eq. 1 for 10,000 realizations with random initial
conditions [40] and plot the ﬁnal circular polarization
correlation of the two condensates at diﬀerent Joseph-
son coupling rates [Fig. 3(c), red line]. For small Joseph-
son amplitudes there is AF coupling of the condensate
states. The stable AF conﬁguration is characterized by
ψ2+ = −ψ1− and ψ2− = −ψ1+, so that Eq. (1) is re-
duced to the two-component problem with renormalized
splitting between X- and Y -polarized states ε(cid:48) = ε − J.
Correspondingly, the AF state loses stability at ε = J
when ε(cid:48) changes sign. The AF state is ﬁrst converted
to the limit cycle motion by the Hopf bifurcation and
then to pseudo-chaotic behavior with further increase
of J. Simultaneously, the stable F conﬁguration with
ψ2+ = ψ1+ and ψ2− = ψ1− emerges for J > ε. This
behavior is in good agreement with the experiment: we
observe the AF coupling at high barrier heights where
the tunneling rate between two condensates (Josephson
coupling) is small and same-site coupling between spins
dominates [Fig. 1(a), white arrows]. On the other hand
when the barrier height is low, F-coupling is seen since
the Josephson coupling dominates [Fig. 1(a), black ar-
rows] [41]. Each interacting pair of condensates then
forms a plaquette, and longer chains of condensates will
form a bosonic ladder [13], which will in future be useful
to probe with magnetic ﬁelds [42]. We note that paired
condensates emit light at the same frequency, as it is also
found experimentally.

The chaotic dynamics in the AF-F crossover region
of the present system is diﬀerent from the chaos in reso-
nantly excited pair of exciton-polariton condensates stud-
ied before [43]. The trapped exciton-polariton conden-
sates here are excited incoherently, yielding chaos in an
autonomous dynamical system. The details of this chaos
and its eﬀects on the emission from the trapped conden-
sates will be studied elsewhere.

Finally, we demonstrate the resonant switching of the
coupled spin states experimentally. We resonantly ex-
cite one of the condensates with a narrow linewidth CW
diode laser, which we refer to as the gate (G). The mem-
brane microcavity allows resonant excitation from the
back side of the cavity without requiring ﬁltering of the
laser backscatter. The gate laser as well as the pump
can be switched on or oﬀ by acousto-optic modulators
(AOM) with a rise time of ∼40 ns. We resonantly excite
the right condensate 20 µs after we turn on the pump
laser. The gate is applied on the right-hand conden-
sate and is right-circularly polarized (σ+). Applying a
cross-polarized gate switches the polarization state of the
condensate, as previously shown [11]. Here, we observe
that resonant switching of the spin of one condensate
also switches the spin of the other coupled condensate,
both in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regimes
(Fig. 4). The condensates remain in the switched state
after the gate laser is switched oﬀ, due to the bistable

nature of the spin states. We note that the resolution-
limited condensate switching time reported here is an
order of magnitude shorter than that of the gate, clearly
showing that (as for single condensates [11]) the switch-
ing process is nonadiabatic. Here we are able to switch
the coupled spin states by transiently injecting minor-
ity spins which are only 1% of the condensates major-
ity spin. Our theoretical description reproduces the fast
spin ﬂips observed in the experiment when noise is in-
jected into Eq. 1. Our theory also shows that in both AF-
and F-regimes, switching the spin state of condensate 1
also switches the spin of condensate 2, both remaining
switched after the pulse is turned oﬀ (see SI. 5).

In conclusion, we demonstrate a tunable spin coupling
mechanism for trapped polariton condensates. A tran-
sition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic coupling
is seen as the potential barrier between the condensates
decreases. Our results correspond well to the interplay
between spin-bifurcation and Josephson coupling in the-
ory. Finally resonant switching of the spin states in both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes is shown.

1. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The cavity’s top (bottom) distributed Bragg reﬂector
(DBR) is made of 32 (35) pairs of Al0.15Ga0.85As/AlAs
layers of 57.2 nm/65.4 nm. Four sets of three 10 nm GaAs
quantum wells (QW) separated by 10 nm thick layers of
Al0.3Ga0.7As are placed at the maxima of the cavity light
ﬁeld. The 5λ/2 (583 nm) cavity is made of Al0.3Ga0.7As.
The microcavity sample is chemically etched from the
substrate side to form 300 µm diameter membranes al-
lowing optical access from the back of the sample for res-
onant excitation. Note the phenomena reported in this
paper do not depend on this etching, which is merely to
conveniently explore the resonant gating regime. The
sample shows condensation under nonresonant excita-
tion [S1]. The CW pump is a single-mode Ti:Sapphire
laser tuned to the ﬁrst Bragg mode ∼ 100 meV above
the condensate energy, and is linearly polarized. In or-
der to create short time-scale realizations, the pump is
amplitude-modulated by an AOM (rise time (cid:39) 40 ns). A
SLM is used to spatially pattern the pump beam into
a double hexagon using the MRAF algorithm [S2]. The
separation of the pump spots can only be changed within
the single-pixel shift limit of the SLM; however, the in-
tensity of the individual spots can be changed nearly ar-
bitrarily. A 0.4 NA objective is used for imaging the
pattern onto the sample. The pulsed gate, which is ap-
plied on the back side of the membrane, is a circularly-
polarized CW single-mode extended cavity diode laser,
which is amplitude modulated using a second AOM. A
cooled CCD and a 0.55 m spectrometer is used for imag-
ing and energy resolving the photoluminescence (PL).
PL is analyzed using a quarter-waveplate and a Wollas-
ton prism in front of the camera. Two photomultiplier
tubes (PMT) and a fast oscilloscope (1 GHz) are used
for time-resolving the polarization-resolved PL of the left
and right condensates. The CCD, the pump/gate laser
and the oscilloscope are all synchronized together using
arbitrary function generators (20 MHz).

2. REAL-SPACE

We can squeeze or stretch the trap without aﬀecting
the barrier pump spots [Fig.S1(a)]. Using a Wollaston
prism in front of the CCD, we measure both circular
polarization components simultaneously for many real-
izations, as shown in Fig. S1. Here, each realization is a
short-time exposure of the sample (t (cid:39) 200 µs). The de-
gree of circular polarization M is given by (i+−i−)/(i+ +
i−), where i± is the intensity image of the right- and left-
circularly polarized emission. The emitted polarization
is not exactly circular due to the spin bifurcation mech-
anism which shows the stable states have a small frac-
tion of linear polarization [S3]. The spatial separation of

symmetry appear (J = 0.625ε). At the transition point
(J = 0.9ε) the AF states destabilize and as J increases
further one stable F-state appears (J = 1.375ε).

Observation of interference fringes suggest that the two
condensates have equal energies. This is conﬁrmed by en-
ergy resolving the condensate emission. We observe that
the two condensates emit light at the same frequency.
In the experiment the energies of the two condensates
are close (<100 µeV) even when they are uncoupled be-
cause experimentally the two traps are symmetric, i.e.,
the pattern intensity is the same for both traps. Then
the coherent coupling between the two traps pulls the
emission frequencies together, in a similar fashion to the
injection locking of two laser oscillators [S5].

By measuring the blueshift of polaritons across the sad-
dle points of the double-hexagon trap, we can extract
the potential proﬁle, as shown in Fig. S4. The potential
barrier between the two traps is a linear function of the
middle pump spots intensity and is ∼ 200 µeV at ur = 1.

4. PUMP-INDUCED SPIN FLIPS

In previous work [S3], we demonstrated how the in-
teraction of the condensate with pump-induced reservoir
results in the reduction of the average condensate mag-
netization M . In that work we noted:

“In a similar fashion to thermal noise, an
overlapping reservoir can also induce spin
noise in the condensate. The spin noise
causes condensate spin ﬂips, which result in
the reduction of the time-averaged circular
polarization. Theoretically, this can be stud-
ied by introducing a noise term similar to Eq.
(9), but instead of depending on temperature,
the noise intensity depends on the overlap-
ping reservoir density.”

Here, we quantify the inﬂuence of the reservoir on the
spin-ﬂip rate, as shown in Fig. S5. We measure the rate
of condensate spin-ﬂips over 1 ms as a function of pump
spot diameter. We observe that the condensate spin-ﬂip
rate increases exponentially as the overlap between the

that from the other arm. By doing this the PL of one
condensate overlaps the PL from both condensates. The
vertical displacement of the beams from the two arms on
a ﬁnal lens before the CCD results in fringes. Observa-
tion of fringes shows that we have partial phase coher-
ence between the two condensates (8% < 1st order deg of
coherence < 25%). The phase can be extracted by select-
ing the ﬁrst-order diﬀraction of the Fourier transformed
images and transforming it back into real-space images.
We observe near zero phase diﬀerence in the circularly
polarized basis of both AF and F regimes.

Phase ﬂuctuations in exciton-polariton condensates are
shown to be due to a combination of condensate num-
ber ﬂuctuations and the interaction of the condensate
with the excitonic reservoir [S4]. Both eﬀects perturb the
phases of the two condensates independently because the
two condensates have separate reservoirs. On the other
hand, the coherent exchange of particles via Josephson
coupling between the two condensates tries to lock their
phases. The mutual coherence is then set by the interplay
between these two eﬀects. The phase coherence is zero
in the case where the condensates are completely uncou-
pled and gradually increases as the Josephson interaction
increases.

Our dynamical simulation also predicts a nearly zero
phase diﬀerence between the same spin components in
both F and AF regimes. Fig. S3 shows a histogram of
the phase diﬀerence between same spin components of
the left and right condensates (φ1+ − φ2+) as a function
of the Josephson coupling rate J. For small Josephson
couplings (J = 0.025ε), F-states with zero phase diﬀer-
ence appear, but their fraction rapidly decreases as J
increases until two stable AF-states with broken phase

reservoir and condensate increases and plateaus, most
probably due to ﬁnite resolution of our detection sys-
tem. To measure the spin correlations as a function of
trap barrier, we broaden the pump spots to ∼ 10 ﬂips/µs,
marked by a dotted line in Fig. S5.

5. RESONANT EXCITATION AND SPIN NOISE

FIG. S6. The time evolution of two condensates for the case
when J = 0.8ε (b) and J = 1.2ε (c) is shown. The condensate-
pairs switch their spin states when a gate pulse with an op-
posite spin is applied on condensate 1. The gate pulse is a
√
spin-up square pulse that is turned on at t = 4 ns and lasts
N = 7.5 × 10−3,
for 1 ns. Parameters as in text with |F|/
where N is the occupation of the condensates with ωg at the
condensate energy.

Here, F is a two-component function representing reso-
nant excitation at frequency ωg. To demonstrate spin-
switching within our theoretical framework, we set the
resonant gate excitation F to a right-circularly polarized
(σ+) pulse which is applied to condensate 1 at t = 4 ns
for a duration of 1 ns. In both the AF-regime and the F-
regime, when the spin state of condensate 1 is switched,
condensate 2 also switches spin, as shown in Fig. S6.
Moreover, both condensates stay in the switched state
after the pulse is turned oﬀ.

To demonstrate noise-induced spin ﬂips a spin noise
function fn is added to Eq. S1. Here, fn(t) = [fn+, fn−]T
where fσ(t) with σ = ±1 is a realization of Gaussian
random processes with zero mean (cid:104)fnσ(t)(cid:105) = 0 and δ-like

densate, in agreement with the experiment.
