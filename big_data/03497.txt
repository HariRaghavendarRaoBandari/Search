THE FLATTENING OF DUST ATTENUATION CURVE TO Z = 2.5

ABSTRACT

We examine the evolution of dust attenuation curve using a sample of 9504 disk star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) selected from the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys and a new technique relying on the fact
that disk SFGs of similar stellar masses at the same cosmic epoch are statistically identical in stellar
populations. We attribute the discrepancy in median magnitude between face-on (b/a > 0.7) and
edge-on (b/a ≤ 0.4) subsamples solely to dust attenuation, and obtain the average attenuation in the
rest-frame UV and optical as functions of stellar mass and redshift out to z = 2.5. Our results show
that the attenuation curve becomes remarkably ﬂatter at increasing redshift for both massive and
low-mass disk SFGs, and remains likely unchanged with galaxy stellar mass at a ﬁxed epoch within
uncertainties. Compared with the Calzetti law, our dust attenuation curves appear to be slightly
steeper at 0.5 < z < 1.4 and remarkably ﬂatter at 1.4 < z < 2.5. Our ﬁndings are consistent with a
picture in which the evolution of dust grain size distribution is mainly responsible for the evolution
of the dust attenuation curve in SFGs; dust shattering becomes a dominant process at z <∼ 1.4,
resulting in an enrichment of small dust grains and consequently a steeper attenuation curve. We
stress that extinction correction for high-z galaxies should be done using mass- and redshift-dependent
attenuation curves.

1. INTRODUCTION

Dust attenuation curve is a key observable to under-
standing of dust evolution and metal cycle, and to the
observability of stellar populations in galaxies. The at-
tenuation curve is governed by abundance, grain size
distribution and chemical composition of dust, which
plays a critical role in multiple physical processes reg-
ulating the evolution of galaxies, including gas cooling,
condense of molecular clouds, star formation, chemical
enrichment, as well as radiation transfer of the ultravi-
olet (UV) and optical into the middle- and far-infrared
emission in galaxies. While the attenuation law for the
local starburst galaxies (Calzetti et al. 2000) has been
widely used in studies of nearby and distant galaxies,
a systematic investigation of dust attenuation curves in
high-z star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is still missing.

The production of dust from core-collapse type II su-
pernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is
correlated with star formation history of galaxies (e.g.,
Valiante et al. 2009; McKinnon et al. 2016).
In con-
trast, star formation in the interstellar medium (ISM)
substantially reduces dust content and locks metals in
stars. The size distribution of dust grains in ISM is con-
tinuously shaped by grain growth processes via accre-
tion of gas-phase metals or adhesion of dust grains, and
also by destruction mechanisms through heating by stel-
lar winds or ionizing radiation (e.g., Nozawa & Fukugita
2013; Asano et al. 2013). Dust shattering is predicted to
control the size distribution of dust grains at a timescale

curves across cosmic time enable us to draw essential
constraints on dust evolution (Santini et al. 2014; Bekki
2015).

2013;
2015;
Salmon et al. 2015) and quasars (e.g. Gallerani et al.
2010). The measures are derived from the UV-selected
galaxies
galaxies
(Zeimann et al. 2015) or a handful of galaxies with spec-
troscopic observations spreading over wide stellar mass
and redshift ranges (Kriek & Conroy 2013; Reddy et al.
2015), and thus unlikely representative for either the
global population or a mass-complete subpopulation of
SFGs. The evolution of dust attenuation curve out to
high-z is still controversial, partially due to the selection
bias and the correlations with spectral type and speciﬁc
star formation rate (sSFR) (e.g., Kriek & Conroy 2013).
Moreover, the attenuation measurements yet are mostly
made through SED modeling, and apparently aﬀected
by the degeneracies between attenuation, stellar age and
metallicity.

Instead, we develop a new technique to derive the av-
erage attenuation curve of a subpopulation of SFGs at
the same cosmic epoch in a statistical manner. We ap-
ply this technique to the CANDELS+3D-HST data sets,
and draw the dust attenuation curves for mass-selected
disk SFGs over 0.5 < z < 3. The paper is organized as
follows. The data and sample selection are described in
Section 2. The details of our technique used to derive
the attenuation curve and our results are presented in
Section 3. We discuss and summarize our results in Sec-
tion 4. Throughout this work, we adopt a cosmology of

2. DATA AND SAMPLE SELECTION

This study makes use of public data in the GOODS-
N, GOODS-S, COSMOS, AEGIS and UDS ﬁelds covered
by the observations from CANDELS (Grogin et al. 2011;
Koekemoer et al. 2011) and 3D-HST (Brammer et al.
2012). The multi-band catalogs including redshift, rest-
frame photometry, and stellar masses have been pro-
vided by the 3D-HST team (see Skelton et al. 2014;
Momcheva et al. 2015, for details). The prior redshift
is chosen in the order of spectroscopic , grism and pho-
tometric redshift. The rest-frame photometry of each
galaxy is derived at the best redshift using the EAZY
software tool (Brammer et al. 2008). The stellar masses
are estimated from the multi-band photometric catalogs
using FAST (Kriek et al. 2009). Galaxy structural pa-
rameters,
including the S´ersic index (n), eﬀective ra-
dius (re) and axis ratio (b/a) are from van der Wel et al.
(2014a), securely extracted from HST /WFC3 F160W
images with GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002).

We aim to select disk galaxies of similar properties to
derive dust attenuation curves. Firstly, the U V J selec-
tion (Whitaker et al. 2011) is adopted to separate star-

forming galaxies (SFGs) from quiescent galaxies over the
redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.0. Secondly, we identify the
extended SFGs with good-ﬁt S´ersic index n < 1.5 as
disk SFGs, for which axis ratio is a direct probe of in-
clination angle. We also limit the disk SFGs of given
stellar mass and redshift to be comparable in size (ef-
fective radius along semi-major axis). This is done via
narrowing down the eﬀective radius within 1 σ centered
at the median (re,0) of the log-normal distribution of
size at the given stellar mass. This cut excludes those
SFGs that are either compact (log re < log re,0 − 1 σ)
or diﬀuse (log re > log re,0 + 1 σ), diﬀering from the ex-
tended disk SFGs in many aspects. The size limitation
is more important for high-z where many SFGs appear
to be compact and systematically redder and rounder
than the normal disk SFGs. We also add stellar mass
cuts > 109 M⊙ at z < 1.9, > 109.5 M⊙ at 1.9 < z < 2.5
and > 1010 M⊙ at 2.5 < z < 3.0 for blue SFGs to en-
sure the selection completeness in stellar mass (see also
van der Wel et al. 2014a). The mass completeness limits
roughly correspond to F160W ∼ 24.5 mag for blue galax-
ies, which is a conservative magnitude limit to derive a
robust GALFIT measurements. Finally, we select a sam-
ple of 9504 disk SFGs in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.0.
The sample galaxies are split into 5 redshift bins and 3
stellar mass bins to ensure that each bin has suﬃcient ob-
jects for statistics. Table 1 lists the numbers of objects
in these bins.

Our selection avoids the bias in magnitude selection
against dusty galaxies. Although the three bins close
to the cut edge contains 14%−40% of objects with
F 160W > 24.5 mag, only < 6% are F 160W > 25.5 mag.
Their structural parameters estimated using GALFIT
still have an accuracy of about 20% for disks with
24.5 < F 160W < 25.5(van der Wel et al. 2012, 2014a).

We caveat that heavily-obscured disk SFGs may be too
faint to be missed by our selection. We argue that such
galaxies are rare and do not cause a signiﬁcant underes-
timate of dust attenuation because they marginally alter
the median magnitude.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

Our sample disk SFGs are selected by morphology
(n < 1.5 and re ∼ re,0 ± 1 σ) and color. The sample
galaxies in a given bin are of similar stellar masses and
redshifts can be treat as the same population. Their
axis ratio b/a is a direct measure of the inclination angle
of these disks projected on the sky. Accounting for the
thickness of disks with n < 1.5, we refer the disks with
b/a ≤ 0.4 to be edge-on and those with b/a > 0.7 to be
face-on. Distant disk SFGs of similar stellar masses and
redshifts are nearly identical in sSFR (i.e. stellar pop-
ulations) (Rodighiero et al. 2011). The two subsamples
are statistically characterized by the same attenuation
curve. The edge-on and face-on disk SFGs are statisti-
cally indistinguishable from each other in terms of their
intrinsic properties, including spectral energy distribu-
tion (SED), metallicity and composition of interstellar
medium. The diﬀerence in geometry between edge-on
and face-on causes discrepancy in opacity, and conse-
quently shaping the observed SEDs by diﬀerent amount
of dust attenuation. The luminosity discrepancy between
the two subpopulations as a function of wavelength thus
describes the dust attenuation curve in the disk SFGs of
given stellar mass and redshift.

The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and optical, includ-
ing 1400 ˚A, 1700 ˚A, 2200 ˚A, 2800 ˚A, U , B, V , R and I-
band, absolute magnitudes (i.e.
luminosities) from the
3D-HST+CANDELS catalogs are used to examine the
luminosity discrepancy between edge-on and face-on sub-
populations. Since dust attenuation usually makes the
UV-to-optical SED of a galaxy to become dimmer and
redder, We thus examine the correlations between color
and inclination angle. Figure 1 shows the distribution
of rest-frame U − V as functions of axis ratio, stellar
mass and redshift for our sample of 9504 disk SFGs.
The median values of U − V are presented for face-on
, intermediately-inclined (0.4 < b/a ≤ 0.7) and edge-
on subsamples in each of bins divided by stellar mass
and redshift. The errorbars represent the 16th and 84th
percentiles of the U − V spread of a subsample.
It is
clear that in each bin U − V systematically increases
at decreasing b/a from face-on to edge-on. The stellar
mass bins of 9 < log(M∗/M⊙) < 9.5 at z > 1.9 and of
9.5 < log(M∗/M⊙) < 10 at z > 2.5 are not included be-
cause of the incompleteness issue. The U −V discrepancy
between edge-on and face-on decreases at decreasing stel-
lar mass and at increasing redshift. The results from Fig-
ure 1 conﬁrm that edge-on disk SFGs are systematically
redder than face-on ones at at z < 2.5, consistent with
the expected eﬀects by dust attenuation.

Comparing the median absolute magnitudes in the
rest-frame UV and optical between edge-on and face-
on subpopulations, we derive magnitude discrepancy in
these bands and plot them in Figure 2. We estimate
uncertainties in magnitude discrepancy using bootstrap-
ping method. The uncertainties are globally decided by
the magnitude spreads and object numbers of edge-on

and face-on subsamples. We point out that for subsam-
ples with 9 < log(M∗/M⊙) < 9.5 the data points ex-
hibit large errorbars due to the small magnitude diﬀer-
ence between the two subpopulations although the ob-
ject numbers are large in these subsamples. As we men-
tioned above, the magnitude discrepancy can be solely
attributed to dust attenuation of galaxies viewed at edge-
on relative to at face-on in a population-averaged sense.
We accordingly refer the magnitude discrepancy between
edge-on and face-on subsamples to be attenuation mag-
nitude A(λ). The data points in Figure 2 thus give the
dust attenuation curves in disk SFGs divided by stellar
mass and redshift. We note that edge-on and face-on
subpopulations have the same attenuation law and A(λ)
in Figure 2 quantiﬁes the attenuation diﬀerence between
the two subpopulations, following the same form of the
attenuation curve. It is clearly seen that A(λ) decreases
with wavelength in all panels.

To quantitatively describe these attenuation curves, we

ﬁt the data points with a power-law function

A(λ) = AV (cid:18) λ

λV (cid:19)−α

,

(1)

where λV = 0.55µm and AV is the attenuation mag-
nitude in the V -band. The power index α measures
the steepness of the attenuation curve. We realize that
the actual extinction law is more complex than a single
power-law, as shown by the formula from Calzetti et al.
(2000) for local starburst galaxies. Our method to de-
rive the extinction curve is based on comparison between
edge-on and face-on disk SFGs in a statistical manner,
and lacks the resolution to determine high-order vari-
ation beyond the power-law (see also Shao et al. 2007;
Chevallard et al. 2013). We only ﬁt the data points
from the 2800 ˚A to I-band. These rest-frame bands are
covered by deep imaging in the observed optical and
near-infrared window (0.4−5 µm) over the redshift range
0.5 < z < 3 examined here. And the rest-frame far-UV
bands (1400, 1700 and 2200 ˚A) are signiﬁcantly dimmed
by dust attenuation and photometry in the correspond-
ing observed bands is often contaminated by noise due to
the low signal-to-noise ratio. We thus exclude the three
far-UV bands from our ﬁtting because they tend to be
strongly biased.

The best-ﬁt AV and α are derived using the least
squares method in logarithm space, and the results are
shown in Figure 2. We can see that the steepness de-
scribed by the power index α decreases with increas-
ing redshift, particularly at z > 1.4. This is to say
that the dust attenuation curve becomes ﬂattening at
higher redshift. The normalization of the attenuation
curve AV remains nearly unchanged with redshift for
log(M∗/M⊙) > 10 but decreases for log(M∗/M⊙) < 10.
At a ﬁxed redshift, the steepness appears to be similar
within uncertainties, while the normalization declines for
lower-mass disk SFGs.

The dust attenuation curves in high-z galaxies were
often compared with the Calzetti law to see the evolu-
tionary eﬀects(Buat et al. 2012; Kriek & Conroy 2013;
Zeimann et al. 2015). Similarly, we also quantify the de-
viation of our attenuation curves from the Calzetti law

attenuation curve is ﬂatter than the Calzetti law, and
δ < 0 if the attenuation curve is steeper. We ignore
the extinction bump at 2175 ˚A originally included in the
formula of Noll et al. (2009).

We perform ﬁtting in the logarithm space using the
linear least squares method and obtain the best-ﬁt δ for
10 attenuation curves, as shown in Table 2. Figure 3
demonstrates the deviations as a function of redshift. We
can see that the attenuation curve is remarkably ﬂatter
than the Calzetti law before z ∼ 1.4, and the attenuation
curve is slightly steeper than the Calzetti law at z <∼
1.4.

4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We develop a new technique to derive dust attenua-
tion curves in distant disk SFGs. Statistically speaking,
the carefully-selected disk SFGs appear to have identi-
cal stellar populations (i.e. sSFR) and thus have similar
intrinsic luminosities in the UV and optical bands. Due
to the disk geometric structure, the observed luminosity
of a disk galaxy is more attenuated at increasing incli-
nation angle. The magnitude discrepancy between face-
on and edge-on can be attributed to dust attenuation,
determined by the opacity that depends on gas column
density, gas-to-dust ratio, dust grain compositions, and
size distribution. These parameters are regulated by dif-
ferent physical processes and may vary with redshift and
galaxy stellar mass. It is challenging to resolve contri-
butions from these processes. This is the basis of our
technique and can be measured in a statistical manner.
Our technique avoids the degeneracies between dust at-
tenuation, stellar age and metallicity, and the assumption
of dust-star geometry included in the methods based on
SED modeling. We select a sample of 9504 extended disk

The Flattening of Dust Attenuation Curve to z = 2.5

5

SFGs with n < 1.5 and log(M/M⊙) > 9 over 0.5 < z < 3
from the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys. The sample
is divided into three mass bins and ﬁve redshift bins.
By comparing the median magnitude between edge-on
(b/a ≤ 0.4) and face-on (b/a > 0.7) subsamples in each
bin, we obtain the average attenuation in the rest-frame
2800 ˚A, U, B, V, R and I-band as functions of stellar mass
and redshift out to z = 2.5 and derive the average atten-
uation curve.

It has been established that at a ﬁxed stellar mass,
SFGs appear to have higher sSFR at increasing redshift
out to z ∼ 2.5; and at a ﬁxed cosmic epoch, disk-like
SFGs obey a constant sSFR (Whitaker et al. 2015). On
the other hand, gas fraction is also expected to increase
with redshift in terms of the Kennicutt-Schmidt Law.
We ﬁnd that attenuation AV declines with galaxy stellar
mass at all epochs from z = 0.5 to z = 2.5 as shown
in Figure 2. This is not surprising because less mas-
sive SFGs tend to be lower in metallicity and less dusty,
leading to a smaller opacity discrepancy between face-on
and edge-on, and smaller attenuation. Moreover, the at-
tenuation AV evolves little for massive disk SFGs with
log(M∗/M⊙) > 10, but decreases with redshift for low-
mass ones with log(M∗/M⊙) < 10. Taking AV as an indi-
cator of opacity, the little evolution of AV with decreas-
ing redshift suggests that multiple processes, including
the decline of gas fraction and the chemical enrichment
in ISM (alternatively, the decrease of gas-to-dust ratio),
balance each other and leave the dust content roughly
constant in the massive disk SFGs. In contrast, the low-
mass disk SFGs follow the same decline of gas fraction,
but need a more rapid evolution in metallicity in order to
yield an increase of opacity (dust content) with decreas-
ing redshift. This is reasonable because massive SFGs are
able to get self-enriched within a short timescale even at
early cosmic epochs but the chemical enrichment in low-
mass SFGs is ineﬃcient due to their shallow potential
well and largely inﬂuenced by the enriched intergalactic
medium in the low-z universe. Whitaker et al. (2014)
pointed out that the infrared excess (LIR/LUV) of low-
mass SFGs with log(M∗/M⊙) < 10.5 remains nearly con-
stant out to z = 2.5 but increases rapidly with redshift
for massive SFGs, suggestive of a relative higher dust
content in massive SFGs at high-z. This is consistent
with our results.

Part of SFGs at high-z are found to be elongated, dif-
fering from a disk structure (van der Wel et al. 2014b).
This would potentially bias the attenuation discrep-
ancy between the edge-on and face-on subsamples to be
smaller. We argue that such galaxies tend to be round
with higher S´ersic indices. our morphological criteria to
select SFGs of similar disk structures and to much ex-
tent get rid of such elongated SFGs, supported by the
similarity of distributions in axis ratio.

The most striking result is that the attenuation curve
becomes remarkably ﬂatter at increasing redshift out to
z = 2.5 for both massive and low-mass disk SFGs, and
remains unchanged within uncertainties with galaxy stel-
lar mass at ﬁxed epochs. The quantitative comparison in
Figure 3 shows that the attenuation curve in disk SFGs
is ﬂatter than the Calzetti law at 1.4 < z < 2.5, and
is roughly identical to or steeper than the Calzetti law
at 0.5 < z < 1.4. Since the determination of attenua-

tion curves in the wavelength range from 2800 ˚A to the
I-band is insensitive to dust compositions (e.g., 2175˚A
bump), the steepness of the curves is mostly decided by
dust grain size distribution. Our ﬁnding thus indicates
that the dust grains become systematically smaller from
z = 2.5 to z = 0.5. This is consistent with the model
prediction by Asano et al. (2014), in which dust is domi-
nated by large grains produced by SNe II and AGB stars
at high redshifts; shattering powered by ionizing photons
and collisions controls the dust evolution in later time,
resulting in a gradually higher fraction of small grains
in the total; and coagulation eﬀects may eventually be-
come dominant when the shattering gets weakened along
with the evolved stellar populations. If so, dust grains
would grow bigger and the attenuation curve would be-
come steeper.
the dust
attenuation curve in local starburst galaxies, is slightly
ﬂatter than the derived curves at 0.5 < z < 1.4, as shown
in Figure 3.

Indeed, the Calzetti Law, i.e.

Compared with previous works, our technique is totally
independent on the degeneracies between stellar age,
metallicity and attenuation, and escapes from the as-
sumptions of intrinsic stellar populations and their SEDs
(Buat et al. 2012; Kriek & Conroy 2013; Zeimann et al.
2015) and uncertainties in estimate of SFR (Penner et al.
2015). Still, previous results on the evolution of dust
attenuation curve can be better understood based on
our ﬁndings. For instance, The anti-correlation be-
tween the steepness of dust attenuation curve and sSFR
among SFGs at 0.5 < z < 2.0 from Kriek & Conroy
(2013) is actually caused by the rapid evolution in both
sSFR and steepness over the redshift range examined.
Zeimann et al. (2015) found that z ∼ 2 emission line
galaxies have a shallower attenuation curve than that
of local starburst galaxies, in agreement with our re-
sults. Buat et al. (2012) presented that 20% of their
UV-selected sample galaxies at 0.95 < z < 2 have a dust
attenuation curve steeper than the Calzetti law and this
fraction increases to 40% for the infrared-detected galax-
ies.
In terms of our ﬁnding that the steepness of dust
attenuation curve evolves with redshift from steeper to
ﬂatter relative to the Calzetti law over 0.5 < z < 2.5,
the change of fraction is purely due to selection eﬀect
because the infrared observations are limited to detect
more galaxies at z < 1.4.

In short, we present a ﬁrst attempt to decompose dust
evolution with cosmic time and its dependence on galaxy
stellar mass. This is critical to understanding physical
processes driving dust evolution. Our conclusions are
based on mass-complete subsamples and thus represen-
tative for the populations of high-z SFGs. We stress that
extinction correction for high-z galaxies should be done
using a matched attenuation curve in terms of galaxy
stellar mass and cosmic epoch.
