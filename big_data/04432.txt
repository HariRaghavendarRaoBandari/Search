Abstract
The large electric dipole moments associated with highly excited Rydberg states
of atoms and molecules make gas-phase samples in these states very well suited
to deceleration and trapping using inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds. The methods of
Rydberg-Stark deceleration with which this can be achieved are reviewed here.
Using these techniques, the longitudinal motion of beams of atoms and molecules
moving at speeds as high as 2500 m/s have been manipulated, with changes in
kinetic energy of up to |∆Ekin| = 1.3 × 10−20 J (|∆Ekin|/e = 80 meV or
|∆Ekin|/hc = 650 cm−1) achieved, while decelerated and trapped samples with
number densities of 106–107 cm−3 and translational temperatures of ∼ 150 mK
have been prepared. Applications of these samples in areas of research at the
interface between physics and physical chemistry are discussed.

Introduction
Rydberg states of atoms and molecules

All atoms and molecules possess Rydberg states. These are excited electronic states
of high principal quantum number, n, that form series converging to each quantum
state (electronic, vibrational, rotational, spin-orbit or hyperﬁne) of the atomic or
molecular ion core (see Fig. 1). To ﬁrst order the energies of these states are given
by the Rydberg formula [1]

En(cid:96) = Eion − hc RM

(n − δ(cid:96))2 ,

(1)

where Eion is the energy associated with the Rydberg series limit, RM =
R∞ µred/me is the Rydberg constant corrected for the reduced mass, µred =
M me/(M + me), of the atom or molecule for which M is the mass of the ion
core and me is the electron mass, δ(cid:96) is a quantum defect which is dependent on the
orbital angular momentum quantum number, (cid:96), of the Rydberg electron, and h and
c are the Planck constant and speed of light in vacuum, respectively.

Rydberg states converging to the lowest ionisation limit of atoms decay via sponta-
neous emission. The corresponding ﬂuorescence lifetimes of the shortest-lived low-
(cid:96) states typically exceed 1 µs for values of n > 30. In molecules low-(cid:96) Rydberg
states often predissociate on timescales (cid:28) 1 µs before spontaneous emission can
occur [2, 3]. However, for molecules with a stable ion core, provided the Rydberg

electron possesses suﬃcient orbital angular momentum (typically if (cid:96) ≥ 4) predis-
sociation cannot occur directly, and long-lived states with characteristic properties
similar to those of Rydberg states in the H atom result.

In non-hydrogenic atoms and in molecules, low-(cid:96) Rydberg states generally posses
non-zero quantum defects, i.e. δ(cid:96) > 0. These arise because the Rydberg electron
penetrates the non-spherically symmetric, incompletely screened, ion core to which
it is bound. As a result these states, for which (cid:96) (cid:46) 4, are more tightly bound
than higher-(cid:96) states with the same values of n, for which δ(cid:96) (cid:39) 0 [see Eq. (1) and
Fig. 1]. Consequently, for each value of n Rydberg states with (cid:96) ≥ 4 can, to a good
approximation, be considered degenerate in energy in the same way that all states
in the H atom, or other hydrogenic atoms (e.g., D, T, He+, Li2+, H and Ps), are.
The (cid:96)-degeneracy of hydrogenic Rydberg states leads to linear Stark energy shifts,
EStark, in an electric ﬁeld, (cid:126)F [4]. These linear Stark shifts can be expressed in the
form

EStark = −(cid:126)µelec · (cid:126)F ,

(2)

and are therefore a consequence of each state possessing an electric dipole moment,
(cid:126)µelec. For each value of n, the maximum induced electric dipole moment µmax (cid:39)
(3/2) n2e a0, where e is the electron charge and a0 is the Bohr radius corrected for
the reduced mass and the charge of the ion core [5]. These electric dipole moments
exceed 1000 D for n > 16, and make states with high values of n particularly
sensitive to electric ﬁelds [6]. Furthermore, in the presence of inhomogeneous ﬁelds

forces, (cid:126)f , can be exerted on atoms or molecules in such states where

(cid:126)f = −∇ EStark

=

∇((cid:126)µelec · (cid:126)F ).

(3)

From the dependence of these forces on the relative orientation of the electric dipole
moment and electric ﬁeld vectors, states with dipole moments oriented parallel
(antiparallel) to the ﬁeld exhibit negative (positive) Stark energy shifts. Therefore
in inhomogeneous ﬁelds atoms or molecules in these states are forced toward higher-
ﬁeld (lower-ﬁeld) regions. Because of this states with positive Stark shifts are often
known as low-ﬁeld-seeking states, while states with negative Stark shifts are known
as high-ﬁeld-seeking states. Forces of the kind described by Eq. (3), experienced by
atoms or molecules possessing non-zero electric dipole moments in inhomogeneous
electric ﬁelds, have played central roles in experiments involving focussing [7], state-
selection [8, 9, 10, 11], and ultimately multistage deceleration and trapping of polar
ground state molecules [12, 13, 14], and are analogous to those exploited in the
experiments of Gerlach and Stern involving silver atoms with non-zero magnetic
dipole moments in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds [15, 16, 17].

In addition to the large electric dipole moments that result from (cid:96)-mixing of
hydrogenic Rydberg states in electric ﬁelds, the resulting Rydberg-Stark states also
exhibit ﬂuorescence lifetimes that are signiﬁcantly longer than those of pure low-(cid:96)
states typically prepared by laser photoexcitation. The ﬂuorescence lifetimes of the
Stark states with the largest electric dipole moments which can be prepared by
two-photon excitation are on the order of 100 µs for values of n > 30 and scale with
n3 – n5 [18].

Over that last 10 years experimental techniques have been developed to exploit
these long lifetimes and large electric dipole moments to accelerate, decelerate,
transport and trap gas-phase samples of atoms and molecules in hydrogenic Ryd-
berg states using inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds. The ubiquity of hydrogenic Ryd-
berg states in atoms and molecules means that these techniques, which are reviewed
here, can be applied to a wide range of species including those that cannot be eas-
ily laser-cooled using current technologies [19, 20], homonuclear diatomic molecules
which do not possess signiﬁcant electric or magnetic dipole moments in their ground
states and therefore cannot be readily decelerated using other methods, e.g., mul-
tistage Stark [12, 14] or Zeeman [21, 22, 23] deceleration, and exotic species such
as the positronium atom with short-lived ground states that are prone to decay by
annihilation [24, 25]. In this respect these Rydberg-Stark deceleration techniques
represent one of several direct approaches to the preparation of chemically impor-
tant cold molecules [26, 27], others include multistage Stark deceleration [12, 14],
multistage Zeeman deceleration [21, 22, 23], optical Stark deceleration [28], buﬀer
gas cooling [29, 30], and sympathetic cooling of molecular ions [31, 32]

In addition to the use of inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds, alternative approaches to
trapping Rydberg atoms have also been developed. These include magnetic trapping
Rb atoms in high-angular-momentum Rydberg states prepared by collisional m-
mixing of low-(cid:96) Rydberg states with values of n close to 130 [33]. The investigation
of approaches to magnetic trapping atoms in such high-(cid:96) states is of relevance to

Rb Rydberg atoms in optical lattices has also been achieved [35].

Applications of decelerated beams of Rydberg atoms and molecules
Highly excited Rydberg states of atoms and molecules play important roles in many
areas at the interface between physics and physical chemistry. Transitions between
individual Rydberg states of carbon with values of n exceeding 1000 have been ob-
served in absorption spectra following recombination in the interstellar medium [36].
In the upper atmosphere of the Earth atoms and molecules in excited states includ-
ing Rydberg states, are also expected to play important roles in the decay processes
and reactivity of atmospheric plasmas [37]. Rydberg-Stark deceleration and electric
trapping of Rydberg atoms and molecules using the techniques reviewed here opens
up opportunities to experimentally study these decay processes in controlled labo-
ratory environments on timescales exceeding 1 ms, which, prior to the development
of these methods, was not possible.

High-resolution laser, millimeter-wave and microwave spectroscopy of atomic and
molecular Rydberg states is of importance in studies of the role of nuclear spins in
photoionisation [38], spectroscopic studies of the interactions of Rydberg atoms
and molecules with surfaces [39, 40], and in the precise determination of ioni-
sation and dissociation energies [41, 42, 43, 44]. In many of these experiments
the achievable frequency resolution is not limited by the bandwidth of the radi-
ation sources used, but instead by the interaction times of the atomic or molec-
ular samples with the radiation ﬁeld. Examples of this eﬀect of interaction-time
broadening in vacuum-ultraviolet–millimeter-wave double-resonance spectra of the
77d[3/2](J(cid:48) = 1) → 93p[3/2](J = 1) transition in Kr can be seen in Fig. 2 [6].
These spectra were recorded following preparation of the 77d[3/2](J(cid:48) = 1) state
by single-photon excitation from the ground state, after which the excited atoms
interacted with a narrow-bandwidth millimeter-wave ﬁeld for a period of time, τ ,
before the population in the 93p[3/2](J = 1) state was detected by selective pulsed

electric-ﬁeld ionisation. The eﬀect of interaction-time broadening can be clearly
seen as τ is increased from 3 µs to τ = 18 µs and the measured line-width decreases
from 350 kHz to 60 kHz. The resolution in these experiments is not limited by the
bandwidth of the millimeter-wave source but instead by the interaction time be-
tween the atoms and the radiation ﬁeld. Further improvements in resolution in these
experiments require longer interaction times. In precision spectroscopic studies of
ground state atoms or molecules this is often achieved using the Ramsey method
of separated oscillatory ﬁelds [45]. However, the sensitivity of high Rydberg states
to stray or inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds makes it challenging to achieve suﬃcient
control over these ﬁelds in an extended volume to exploit these methods. For this
reason the most appropriate approach to increasing interaction times is to exploit
decelerated beams.

The development of methods for preparing quantum-state-selected velocity-
controlled beams of atoms and molecules which possess electric or magnetic dipole
moments in their ground or low-lying metastable states has given rise to opportu-
nities to perform low-energy scattering experiments with collision energy resolution
on the order of Ekin/hc = 0.01 cm−1 (see, e.g., [46, 47]). In a similar vein, a range
of scattering studies, involving atoms or molecules in high Rydberg states, are ex-
pected to beneﬁt from the opportunities to prepare cold, velocity-tuneable beams
using Rydberg-Stark deceleration. These range from studies of the interactions of
Rydberg atoms and molecules with surfaces, to investigations of energy transfer
in collisions between samples of Rydberg atoms or molecules and ground states
species.

The interactions of atoms and molecules in high Rydberg states with surfaces
are of importance in several areas of research, including, e.g., cavity-quantum-
electrodynamics at vacuum–solid-state interfaces [39, 48], experiments involving the
photoexcitation of Rydberg states of samples conﬁned in miniature vapor cells [49],
and studies of charge transfer [3, 50]. At distances of < 10 µm from conduct-
ing surfaces, the interaction of a Rydberg atom or molecule with its image-dipole
in the surface contributes to state-changing and attractive forces toward the sur-
face [48, 51, 52]. Investigations of these processes are of importance in developing
accurate models for charge-transfer (ionisation) into the surfaces [50, 53, 54]. Sev-
eral studies of these surface-ionisation processes have been carried out using beams
of Rydberg atoms and molecules. These have included experiments with beams of K
and Xe atoms [50, 53] and H2 molecules [54], and with beams of H atoms prepared
in Stark states with large electric dipole moments which permitted investigations
of the role that the orientation of the electric dipole moment with respect to the
surface had on the ionisation dynamics [55]. Recent experimental studies of reso-
nant charge-transfer from H Rydberg atoms at Cu(100) surfaces have highlighted
a dependence of the ionization process on the velocity of the incoming Rydberg
atoms [56]. This would suggest that it will be of interest in future studies to exploit
velocity-controlled or decelerated beams to obtain precise control over the positions
and momenta of the atoms or molecules.

The high polarizability and large electric dipole moments of high Rydberg states
give rise to strong van der Waals, dipole-dipole and higher order electric multipole
interactions [58, 59]. These have been exploited in laser cooled samples of ultracold

atoms to blockade photoexcitation [60, 61, 62], study cooperative eﬀects [63], and
prepare multiparticle entangled states [64, 65]. However, these properties, which
are a result of the large spatial extent of Rydberg electron wavefunctions, also play
important roles in the interactions of samples in Rydberg states with ground state
atoms or molecules [66]. Perhaps the most spectacular consequences of these inter-
actions are seen in long-range Rydberg molecules [67, 57]. As depicted in Fig. 3(a)
and (b) these molecules arise as a result of the scattering of a slow electron in a
diﬀuse Rydberg orbital from a ground state atom or molecule. These bound molec-
ular states have so far only been observed upon photoassociation in samples of laser
cooled atoms [see Fig. 3(c)], however, it can be expected that they should also play
a role in very-low–energy atomic or molecular scattering experiments in which one
of the collision partners is prepared in a high Rydberg state. The development of
methods such as those reviewed here for preparing a wider range of cold, deceler-
ated beams of atoms and molecules in Rydberg states has the potential to open up
exciting opportunities for studies of this unique gas-phase chemistry at long-range.
Highly excited Rydberg states of atoms and molecules are very sensitive to res-
onant electromagnetic ﬁelds at microwave or millimeter-wave frequencies. This is
a consequence of (1) the fact that the energy diﬀerences between states for which
∆n = 1 scale with n−3 and correspond to transition frequencies < 400 GHz for
n ≥ 25; and (2) the large electric dipole transition moments for these ∆n = 1 tran-
sitions which scale with n2 and approach ∼ 150 ea0 for n = 25. These properties,
combined with their long lifetimes, have seen Rydberg atoms play an important
role in studies of microwave cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) since the ﬁeld
was established [68].

Recent implementations of microwave cavity QED in two-dimensional surface-
based superconducting microwave circuits [69] have led to a new role for Rydberg
atoms in hybrid cavity QED experiments [70]. In these hybrid gas-phase–solid-
state systems the Rydberg atoms are considered as long-coherence-time quantum

bits (qubits) which will be coupled via two-dimensional chip-based superconducting
microwave resonators to solid-state devices. These hybrid quantum systems take ad-
vantage of the long coherence times oﬀered by gas-phase atoms as qubits, the strong
coupling that can be achieved between Rydberg atoms and microwave resonators
because of the their large electric dipole transition moments, and the scalability of-
fered by micro-fabricated superconducting circuits to open new avenues of study in
cavity QED at vacuum–solid-state interfaces, and potential applications in quantum
information processing.

Several approaches have been pursued in these experiments, including the reali-
sation of atom-chips containing microwave circuitry with which cold samples of Rb
have been prepared and then photoexcited to Rydberg states [71, 72], and the prepa-
ration of beams of Rydberg atoms which propagate above the surfaces containing
the microwave circuits (see Fig. 4) [39]. The latter approach has several advantages.
The chip-based circuits can be located in a cryogenic environment where direct
laser access is not required, Rydberg state photoexcitation can be carried out in
a region of the apparatus which is spatially separated from the microwave circuits

permitting ﬁner control over the initial-state preparation process, and atoms or
molecules can be selected for use in the experiments to ensure that eﬀects of ad-
sorption on the cryogenic surfaces is minimised [40]. An example of the coherent
coupling of beams of helium Rydberg atoms to pulsed microwave ﬁelds surrounding
a co-planar waveguide are displayed in Fig. 4(b) and (c) [39]. The dependence of
the observed Rabi frequency for microwave transitions between Rydberg states on
the microwave power can be clearly seen in the Fourier transforms of the experi-
mental and calculated data [Fig. 4(d) and (e)]. In these experiments the dephasing
of the Rabi oscillations was dominated by the spatial spread of the Rydberg atom
beam in the inhomogeneous stray electric ﬁelds above the surface of the waveguide
and the motion of the atoms. This work has in part provided motivation for the
development of the chip-based guides, decelerators and traps for beams of Rydberg
atoms and molecules reviewed here.

Experimental techniques with which the translational motion of Rydberg atoms
and molecules can be manipulated are of particular interest in experiments with
antihydrogen (H) and positronium (Ps). Antihydrogen atoms formed by recombi-
nation of antiprotons and positrons [34], or by positron transfer in collisions between
antiprotons and Rydberg positronium atoms [74, 75, 76, 77] are produced in high
Rydberg states. At present H atoms that eventually decay to their ground state can
be magnetically trapped [78, 79], however, no attempts have been made to conﬁne
the atoms while in the Rydberg states to improve the ultimate trapping eﬃciency

after decay. In this respect, the implementation of methods to electrically trap Ry-
dberg atoms in a wide rage of Stark states in the presence of strong background
magnetic ﬁelds is of particular interest. In addition, the AEgIS experiment, cur-
rently under development at CERN, is designed to exploit inhomogeneous electric
ﬁelds to accelerate Rydberg H atoms to produce beams with tuneable velocities for
antimatter gravity and spectroscopy experiments [77].

The Ps atom, the bound state of an electron and a positron, is another unique
system which is of interest in tests of the eﬀect of the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld of
particles composed of antimatter, [80, 81] and precision spectroscopy of fundamental
importance [82]. The longer-lived triplet ground state of Ps has an annihilation
lifetime of 142 ns [25], while the singlet state lives for 125 ps [24]. However, when
excited to high Rydberg states, as in the data in Fig. 5, the spatial overlap of the
electron and positron wavefunctions is reduced with the result that for all excited
triplet levels other than the 2 3S1 level the rate of ﬂuorescence to the ground state is
greater than the direct annihilation rate. Furthermore because of its reduced mass of
exactly 0.5 me, where me is the electron (≡ positron) mass, the ﬂuorescence lifetimes
of Rydberg states of Ps [73, 83, 84, 85] are twice as long as those of states with the
same values of n in the H atom. For this reason Rydberg states of Ps are well suited
for precision spectroscopic studies, and tests of antimatter gravity. The challenge
associated with carrying out precision spectroscopy or gravity measurements with
Rydberg Ps is the high speeds (∼ 105 m/s) with which the samples, produced by
implantation of pulsed positron beams into room temperature porous silica targets,
move [86]. However, these speeds correspond to kinetic energies Ekin/e (cid:39) 50 meV
(Ekin/hc (cid:39) 460 cm−1) that lie well within the ∼ 80 meV (≡ 650 cm−1) changes in
kinetic energy that have been achieved in Rydberg-Stark deceleration of fast beams
of He Rydberg atoms using inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds [87]. As a result Rydberg-
Stark deceleration represents a viable route to the preparation of slowly moving, or
electrically trapped, Ps atoms.

Rydberg states in electric ﬁelds
In the presence of an external electric ﬁeld (cid:126)F = (0, 0, F ), the Hamilton, H, of an
atom with a single excited Rydberg electron can be expressed as

H = H0 + HS

= H0 + eF z,

(4)

where H0 is the Hamiltonian in the absence of the ﬁeld, HS is the Stark Hamiltonian
representing the interaction with the ﬁeld, e is the electron charge, and z represents
the position in cartesian coordinates.

The Stark eﬀect in Rydberg states of the hydrogen atom
In hydrogenic Rydberg states the Schr¨odinger equation associated with the Hamilto-
nian H can be solved in parabolic coordinates [89, 90]. The wavefunctions obtained
are characterised by four quantum numbers: n, m the azimuthal quantum number,
and two parabolic quantum numbers n1 and n2. These quantum numbers satisfy
the condition that n = n1 + n2 + |m| + 1. The energies of the eigenstates, generally

where Eh = 2hc RM and a0 are the Hartree energy and the Bohr radius corrected for
the reduced mass and the charge of the ion core, respectively. Often the diﬀerence
between the two parabolic quantum numbers is denoted by the index k, such that
k = n1 − n2. For each value of m, the allowed values of k range from −(n−|m|− 1)
to +(n − |m| − 1) in intervals of 2. The resulting electric ﬁeld dependence of the
m = 0 Stark states of the H atom with values of n ranging from 7 to 14 are displayed
in Fig. 6(a). From this energy level diagram it can be seen that in weak electric
ﬁelds the ﬁrst order, linear Stark shift dominates with the quadratic and higher
order terms gradually increasing in signiﬁcance as the ﬁeld strength increases. This
eﬀect is most visible in this ﬁgure for the states with values of k close to zero in
this ﬁgure.

Comparison of the ﬁrst order term in electric ﬁeld strength in Eq. (5) with
Eq. (2) indicates that to each Stark state an electric dipole moment of (cid:126)µn k =
(0, 0,−(3/2) nk e a0) can be attributed. These electric dipole moments are a con-

sequence of the spatial distribution of electron charge about the ion core in each
eigenstate, as is evident from the electron probability density distributions displayed
in Fig. 6(b) for the n = 8 Stark states with k = −7,−1, +1 and +7 [88]. The notice-
able spatial separation of the positive charge of the ion core, from the distribution
of negative charge associated with the electron, seen for the k = +7 Stark state
in Fig. 6(b) indicates clearly that the electric dipole moment (214 D) of this state
is oriented antiparallel to (cid:126)F giving rise to the positive Stark energy shift of this
state in Fig. 6(a). In the same way the negative Stark shift of the k = −7 state
results from the orientation of its electric dipole moment parallel to (cid:126)F . As can be
seen in Fig. 6(b) the states with low values of |k| in the middle of the Stark mani-
fold have approximately equal distributions of electron charge on either side of the
ion core and therefore small electric dipole moments (31 D) and weak linear Stark
shifts. Typically Rydberg-Stark deceleration experiments have been performed fol-
lowing photoexcitation of outer Stark states with values of n between 15 and 60,
and electric dipole moments between 500 D and 13500 D.

Electric ﬁeld ionisation of hydrogenic Rydberg states
In manipulating the translational motion of atoms or molecules in hydrogenic
Rydberg-Stark states using inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds, the maximal ﬁelds that
can be employed are limited by the ionisation electric ﬁelds of the states in which
the samples are prepared. The Stark contribution, HS, to the Hamiltonian in Eq. (4)
gives rise to a saddle point in the potential experienced by the Rydberg electron. If
the energy of this saddle point lies below the energy of the excited Rydberg state,
electric ﬁeld ionisation will occur. This ionisation ﬁeld depends strongly on the value
of n, and also on the value of k. The outermost state with a negative Stark energy
shift [e.g., the k = −7 state in Fig. 6(a)] typically ionises in ﬁelds equal to or larger
than the classical ionisation ﬁeld, Fclass, for which the energy of the Stark saddle
point coincides with the energy of the Stark state in the ﬁeld [18]

and En n1 n2 m is the energy of the state, with respect to the ﬁeld-free ionisation
limit, in the presence of the electric ﬁeld. With this in mind, the classical ionisation
ﬁeld, Eq. (6), corresponds to the ﬁeld in which the ionisation rate of the k = −(n−1)
state is ∼ 108 s−1. Typically electric ﬁeld switching times on the order of 10 ns are
achieved in experiments in which pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation is employed for the
detection of Rydberg atoms or molecules. To ensure complete ionisation, ﬁelds that
lead to ionisation rates on the order of 108 s−1 are therefore required. Because the
Rydberg electron has a non-zero probability of being located on the side of the ion
core opposite to the Stark saddle point for states with values of k > −(n−1), higher
ﬁelds are required to achieve equivalent ionisation rates for these states. The result
of this is that the ﬁelds for which similar ionisation rates occur for the k = +(n− 1)
states is approximately 2Fclass. Calculating the ionisation rate using Eq. (7), and
accounting for energy shifts up to fourth-order in F , leads to ionisation rates of
108 s−1 for the n = 30, k = −29 and k = +29 states of 740 V/cm and 1750 V/cm,
respectively.

Fluorescence lifetimes

While an atom or molecule in a highly excited Rydberg state is energetically far from
equilibrium, Rydberg-Stark states with suﬃciently long ﬂuorescence lifetimes to
permit deceleration to zero mean velocity in the laboratory-ﬁxed frame-of-reference
and electric trapping can generally be photoexcited from a ground state, or low-
lying intermediate state. The ﬂuorescence rate, Γn(cid:96), of an excited Rydberg state,
|n (cid:96)(cid:105), is given by the sum of the Einstein A coeﬃcients associated with all allowed

dependence of the Einstein A coeﬃcient on the cube of the transition frequency,
the lifetimes of np Rydberg states are typically dominated by decay to the ground
state. For |n(cid:96)(cid:105) Rydberg states with (cid:96) (cid:54)= 1, decay via a single-photon electric-dipole
transition to the 1s cannot occur and, as can be seen in Fig. 7(a), longer lifetimes
result.

The mixed-(cid:96) character of Rydberg-Stark states results in rates of ﬂuorescence
which lie between the ﬂuorescence rates of the short-lived low-(cid:96) states and the
longest-lived ‘circular’ (cid:96) = n − 1 states. These ﬂuorescence rates also have a strong
dependence on the value of |m| since Stark states with higher values of |m| do
not exhibit short-lived low-(cid:96) character because of the requirement that (cid:96) ≥ |m|.
The ﬂuorescence lifetime of each |nn1n2m(cid:105) Rydberg-Stark state is determined by
summing over the decay rates, Γn(cid:96), associated with all allowed decay pathways from
the |n(cid:96)(cid:105) states into which it can be transformed weighted by the transformation
coeﬃcients [92]. These transformation coeﬃcients can be expressed in terms of
Wigner-3J symbols as [18],

higher values of |m|. The ﬂuorescence lifetimes of |m| = 2 Stark states with values
of n > 30, which are typically prepared experimentally, exceed 140 µs.

The Stark eﬀect in non-hydrogenic atoms and molecules
In non-hydrogenic atoms and in molecules, the non-spherical symmetry of the ion
core causes core-penetrating low-(cid:96) Rydberg states to be more strongly bound than
the high-(cid:96) ‘hydrogenic’ states. This eﬀect is accounted for in the Rydberg formula in
Eq. (1) by the introduction of non-zero quantum defects, δ(cid:96), for these low-(cid:96) states. In
general the values of the quantum defects are most signiﬁcant for states with (cid:96) ≤ 4,
while for higher-(cid:96) states δ(cid:96) (cid:39) 0. In the presence of electric ﬁelds, non-hydrogenic low-
(cid:96) Rydberg states exhibit quadratic Stark shifts in weak ﬁelds and give rise to large
avoided crossings in Stark maps in higher ﬁelds. These eﬀects can be seen clearly
for the case of Li in Fig. 8(a). The quantum defects of the s-, p- and d-states close
to n = 15 used in these calculations were δs = 0.399, δp = 0.053 and δd = 0.002 [93].
Because of these non-zero quantum defects, the 15s and 15p states are shifted to
lower energies than the higher-(cid:96) states. These states then exhibit quadratic Stark
shifts in ﬁelds below ≈ 1000 V/cm and give rise to the large avoided crossings in
ﬁelds beyond the Inglis-Teller limit, FIT = F0/(3n5), where states with values of n
which diﬀer by 1 ﬁrst overlap (e.g., for n = 15, FIT ≈ 2000 V/cm).

The calculation of the energy-level structure of non-hydrogenic Rydberg states of
atoms and molecules in electric ﬁelds can be achieved by constructing the Hamil-
tonian matrix in a spherical |n(cid:96)m(cid:105) basis and determining its eigenvalues. This
approach has been employed previously to calculate the Stark eﬀect in Rydberg
states of alkali metal atoms [93]. In addition to being suited to treating non-
hydrogenic atomic systems, this method has also been extended to Rydberg states
of molecules [94, 95, 96]. The coeﬃcients of the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian
matrix can then be employed to calculate the spectral intensities of transitions to,
and the ﬂuorescence lifetimes of, the resulting eigenstates.
The zero-ﬁeld matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal in the |n(cid:96)m(cid:105) basis and
the matrix elements can be calculated using Eq. (1). The term in the Hamiltonian
in Eq. (4) representing the eﬀect of the electric ﬁeld is

HS = e F z

= e F r cos θ,

(14)

in spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ). This gives rise to matrix elements of the form [93]

(cid:104)n(cid:48) (cid:96)(cid:48) m(cid:48)|e F r cos θ|n (cid:96) m(cid:105) = e F(cid:104)(cid:96)(cid:48) m(cid:48)| cos θ|(cid:96) m(cid:105)(cid:104)n(cid:48) (cid:96)(cid:48)|r|n(cid:96)(cid:105).

Because

cos θ =

(15)

(16)

the angular components of Eq. (15) can be determined by expansion in terms of
spherical harmonics, Y(cid:96) m. Therefore the angular matrix elements are zero unless
m(cid:48) = m and (cid:96)(cid:48) = (cid:96)± 1 (i.e., ∆m = 0 and ∆(cid:96) = ±1). Thus the external electric ﬁeld
mixes states with orbital angular momentum diﬀering by one but does not give rise
to m-mixing. Exploiting the properties of spherical harmonics [97] permits these
non-zero angular integrals to be expressed analytically as [89, 93]

The radial matrix elements (cid:104)n(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)|r|n(cid:96)(cid:105) can be calculated analytically for the H
atom [89]. For non-hydrogenic species, they can be determined numerically using
the Numerov method [18, 93].

The precision of the Stark energy level structure calculated in this way depends on
the accuracy of the quantum defects used and on the range of values of n included
in the basis. Tests of convergence must be performed for the particular values of
n, and the range of ﬁeld strengths of interest. In weak ﬁelds, for which F (cid:28) FIT,
contributions from matrix elements coupling states with diﬀerent values of n are

small and basis sets with only a small number of states are therefore often accept-

able. However, in ﬁelds closer to, and beyond, the Inglis-Teller limit n-mixing plays

a much more signiﬁcant role with the result that larger basis sets are necessary.

Similar approaches can be employed in the calculation of the Stark eﬀect in molec-

ular Rydberg states. To account for the vibrational and rotational degrees of free-

dom of the molecular ion core the basis used must be extended. For example, in

the calculation of the Stark eﬀect in Rydberg states of H2, a Hund’s-case-(d) zero-
ﬁeld basis |n(cid:96)N +N MN(cid:105), where N + is the rotational angular momentum quantum
number of the H+
2 ion core, N is the total angular momentum quantum number
excluding spin ( (cid:126)N = (cid:126)N + + (cid:126)(cid:96) ), and MN is the projection of (cid:126)N onto the electric ﬁeld
axis, is appropriate if vibrational channel interactions do not signiﬁcantly perturb

the spectra in the regions of interest [94, 98, 99].

Using this approach, and assuming that singlet-triplet mixing can be neglected,

the diagonal elements of the electronic Hamiltonian matrix are ﬁrst determined in a
Hund’s-case-(b) basis |n(cid:96)ΛN(cid:105), where Λ is the quantum number associated with the
projection of the electronic orbital angular momentum vector onto the internuclear

axis. This facilitates the inclusion of the appropriate non-zero quantum defects, δ(cid:96) Λ,
for the low-(cid:96) Rydberg series converging to each rotational state of the ion core. In

this basis, rotational channel interactions between series with a particular value of
(cid:96) (i.e., for which ∆(cid:96) = 0, while (cid:96) ≤ 3) can then be included as oﬀ-diagonal matrix
elements before transforming to the Hund’s-case-(d) basis to include the eﬀects of

the electric ﬁeld. In this, Hund’s-case-(d) basis the energies of the rotational states

of the ion core are then included as diagonal elements.

|MJ| = 0, 1 and 2 Rydberg states of para-H2, from −265 cm−1 to −155 cm−1 with
respect to the adiabatic ionisation limit are displayed in Fig. 9. This wavenumber
range encompasses N + = 0 states for which n = 21 → 27, N + = 2 states for which
n = 16 → 18, and the N + = 4 states for which n = 12 [98].

Lifetimes of molecular Rydberg states
In general, the ﬂuorescences lifetimes of Rydberg states of molecules are similar
to those in atoms, i.e., the ﬂuorescence lifetimes of the pure low-(cid:96) states exceed
1 µs for values of n > 30, while those of the shortest-lived Rydberg-Stark states
are 10 – 100 times longer. However, molecular Rydberg states can also decay by
predissociation. This involves the transfer of energy from the Rydberg electron to
the nuclear degrees of freedom of the molecule, typically as a result of the interaction
between the potential energy surface of the Rydberg state with that of a repulsive
valence state. The outcome of this process is the decay of the molecule into two or
more fragments in their ground or excited states[2, 3].
Most rapid predissociation occurs on timescales (cid:28) 1 µs. As a result, in general
predissociative states are not well suited to Rydberg-Stark deceleration for which
lifetimes (cid:38) 10 µs are required. However, the molecular Rydberg states which ex-
hibit the most rapid predissociation are those of core-penetrating low-(cid:96) character,
for which the Rydberg electron has a signiﬁcant charge density in the vicinity of
the ion core. For Rydberg electrons in higher (cid:96) states, the centrifugal barrier en-
sures that they do not signiﬁcantly perturb the bond in the molecular ion core
and predissociation can be inhibited. Because the quantum defects of high Rydberg
states depend directly on the penetration of the Rydberg electron into the ion core,
molecular Rydberg states with large quantum defects tend to be signiﬁcantly more
susceptible to predissociation than states with quantum defects approaching zero.

Hydrogenic Rydberg-Stark states of non-hydrogenic atoms and molecules
For greatest eﬃciency, Rydberg-Stark deceleration should be implemented using
hydrogenic Rydberg-Stark states with linear Stark energy shifts and lifetimes ex-
ceeding ∼ 10 µs. Ideally the only limitation imposed on the electric ﬁelds employed
should be that they remain at all times below the ionisation ﬁeld. In hydrogenic
atoms this condition is readily met. However, in non-hydrogenic species the avoided
crossings at and beyond the Inglis-Teller limit [see Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 9(a)] are often

Hogan

Page 18 of 53

too large to be traversed diabatically during deceleration. The result of this is that
for F > FIT the Stark states lose their electric dipole moments and cannot be eﬃ-
ciently manipulated in these ﬁelds. In molecules, predissociation of low-(cid:96) Rydberg
states also results in lifetimes which are insuﬃcient for deceleration.

However, these two challenges associated with decelerating non-hydrogenic atoms
and molecules can be circumvented simultaneously by preparing states which do
not have core-penetrating low-(cid:96) character. This is achieved by exploiting the selec-
tion rules for electric dipole transitions in the photoexcitation process to control the
absolute value of the azimuthal quantum number, |m|, of the Rydberg states. By
carefully controlling the value of |m|, (cid:96)-mixing induced by the electric ﬁelds can be
restricted to states for which (cid:96) ≥ |m|. For example, if Rydberg states with |m| = 1
are prepared in Li, Fig. 8(b), the Stark states do not possess s-character. As a re-
sult, the avoided crossings at and beyond the Inglis-Teller limit are reduced (from
∼ 1.4 cm−1 ≡ 42 GHz to ∼ 0.1 cm−1 ≡ 3 GHz). Preparation of states with |m| = 2,
Fig. 8(c), removes the contribution from the p-states, the other states with a signiﬁ-
cant non-zero quantum defect, resulting in a Stark map which is almost identical to
that of the hydrogen atom with m = 0, Fig. 8(d). The primary diﬀerence between
the Stark maps in Fig. 8(c) and (d) is that in the former the outermost Stark states
are absent. Photoexcitation of |m| = 2 Rydberg-Stark states can readily be achieved
in Li using a resonance-enhanced two-color two-photon excitation scheme from the
1s22s 2S1/2 ground state driven using circularly polarised laser radiation with the
same helicity for both steps of the excitation process, and propagating parallel to the
electric ﬁeld in the photoexcitation region. Alternatively, non-resonance enhanced
single-color two-photon excitation using circularly polarised radiation could also be
employed [100].

Multiphoton excitation schemes can also be implemented in molecules for the
preparation of long-lived hydrogenic Rydberg states. The dependence of the Stark
maps of para-H2 on the value of |MJ| can be seen in Fig. 9. In this case, if photoex-
citation to non–core-penetrating Rydberg states with (cid:96) ≥ 3 is carried out, predisso-
ciation is inhibited and the resulting long-lived Rydberg-Stark states with N + = 0
exhibit a hydrogenic behaviour. These states have been prepared in deceleration and
trapping experiments by resonance-enhanced three-color three-photon excitation
using circularly polarised laser radiation following the excitation scheme [101, 98]

which raises, after each step, the value of (cid:96), J and |MJ| by one. This approach
to the preparation of long-lived molecular Rydberg states using carefully chosen
multiphoton excitation schemes is quite general and could also be applied to other
molecules. Decelerated and trapped molecular samples in hydrogenic Rydberg-Stark
states oﬀer the opportunity to observe slow predissociation processes and study their
sensitivity to external ﬁelds, blackbody radiation and collisions on timescales that

and decay processes in states with low-(cid:96) character microwave transitions could be
exploited to eﬃciently change the value of |MJ| after deceleration and trapping.

Eﬀects of blackbody radiation on high Rydberg states
The small ∆n = 1 energy intervals and large electric dipole transition moments of
Rydberg states of atoms and molecules make them very sensitive to low-frequency
(microwave or millimeter-wave) electromagnetic radiation. In particular, the black-
body radiation ﬁeld of the environment surrounding the Rydberg atoms or molecules
can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the Rydberg state population giving rise to energy
level shifts [102], transitions between Rydberg states [103, 104] and photoionisa-
tion [105, 106]. The most important aspect of the blackbody radiation ﬁeld in the
treatment of its interaction with a Rydberg atom or molecule is the mean photon
occupation number per mode n(ν). n(ν) represents the average number of black-
body photons of one polarisation, with frequency ν, at a temperature T , and can
be expressed as [107]

n(ν) =

1

ehν/kBT − 1

,

(21)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Mean photon occupation numbers for black-
body temperatures of 300 K, 125 K, 10 K and 4 K are presented in Fig. 10(a)
and (b) over two diﬀerent frequency and wavenumber ranges.
In such a thermal radiation ﬁeld, the transition rate from an initial state |n(cid:96)m(cid:105)
to a state |n(cid:48)(cid:96)(cid:48)m(cid:48)(cid:105), is given by the product of the mean photon occupation number
at the frequency of the transition, and the Einstein A coeﬃcient for the transition.
For example, at n = 30 in the H atom, the wavenumber of the transition from
the 30s state to the 31p state is 7.74 cm−1 (≡ 232 GHz) and the radial integral
|(cid:104)31p|r|30s(cid:105)| = 316 a0. At room temperature (300 K), the mean photon occupation
number at this frequency is n(ν = 232 GHz) = 26, and therefore the blackbody

transition rate is 2 436 s−1. After summing the transition rates to all neighbouring
Rydberg states, the total blackbody depopulation rate for H atoms in the absence
of external ﬁelds at n = 30 can be determined to be ∼12 400 s−1 which corresponds
to a time constant of ∼ 80 µs.
In the presence of an electric ﬁeld, the rates of n-changing transitions driven by
blackbody radiation are highest between states with electric dipole moments with
a similar orientation with respect to the electric ﬁeld, and of similar magnitude.
Consequently, for an atom or molecule in an outer Rydberg-Stark state with a posi-
tive Stark shift conﬁned in an electrostatic trap, the blackbody transitions with the
highest rate will be ∆n = ±1 transitions to other trapped states which also exhibit
Stark shifts. As a result, n-changing transitions driven by blackbody radiation do
not in general lead to an immediate loss of atoms or molecules from an electrostatic
trap. However, direct blackbody photoionisation of trapped atoms or molecules does
lead to trap loss and plays a signiﬁcant role on timescales on the order of 100 µs
for states with values of n close to 30 in a room temperature environment [105].

Rydberg-Stark deceleration
The ﬁrst proposals to exploit the large electric dipole moments associated with
highly excited Rydberg states for deceleration and electrostatic trapping of atoms
and molecules were advanced in the early 1980s. In an article on “Electrostatic
trapping of neutral atomic particles” in 1980, Wing pointed out that “At moderate
ﬁeld strengths Rydberg atoms have trap depths comparable to ambient kT ...” [108].
While in their article on “Stark acceleration of Rydberg atoms in inhomogeneous
electric ﬁelds” in 1981, Breeden and Metcalf wrote that “Rydberg atoms exhibit
large electric dipole moments suggesting that inhomogeneous ﬁelds can exert forces
on them” and that “... the resultant change in kinetic energy is equal to the Stark
shift of the Rydberg state” [109].

Deceleration in time-independent electric ﬁelds
First experiments in which the interactions of samples in Rydberg states with in-
homogeneous electric ﬁelds were studied were reported in 2001 by Softley and co-
workers [110]. This work involved the deﬂection of a pulsed supersonic beam of
Kr atoms in the time-independent dipolar electric-ﬁeld distribution surrounding a
pair of cylindrical electrodes as depicted in Fig. 11(a). By selectively photoexciting
Rydberg-Stark states, each with a diﬀerent electric dipole moment [see Fig. 11(b)],
directly above the pair of electrodes, deﬂection in the y-dimension, toward or away
from the dipole was observed depending on the orientation and magnitude of the
dipole moments of the states. This deﬂection was monitored by imaging the Rydberg
atoms when they impinged upon a microchannel plate (MCP) detector Fig. 11(c).
These ﬁrst experiments subsequently led to a proof-of-principle demonstration
of the longitudinal acceleration of fast beams of hydrogen molecules in time-
independent ﬁelds [99, 111] (see Fig. 12). In this work, a diﬀerence in the time
of ﬂight of the molecules over a ﬁxed distance was observed for beams of H2 in the
extreme low-ﬁeld-seeking and extreme high-ﬁeld-seeking n = 17 Stark states of the
ν+ = 0, N + = 2 Rydberg series when the molecules were decelerated or accelerated
in the inhomogeneous electric ﬁeld of a pair of cylindrical electrodes, respectively.

Following this, experiments were carried out by Vliegen, Merkt and co-workers [112]
using pulsed supersonic beams of Ar atoms. These studies were ﬁrst performed in
the static inhomogeneous electric ﬁeld distribution of a pair of electrodes in a wedge
conﬁguration, generating an electric ﬁeld gradient along the axis of the atomic beam.
The eﬀects of non-hydrogenic low-(cid:96) Rydberg states on the deceleration process in
electric ﬁelds at and beyond the Inglis-Teller limit were identiﬁed in this work. The
observation was made that the avoided crossings in these regions of the Stark map
were traversed adiabatically under the conditions of the experiments. However, for
Rydberg-Stark states of the H atom the opposite behavior was seen, with energy
level crossings in ﬁelds beyond the Inglis-Teller limit traversed diabatically [113].
This conﬁrmed that the Runge-Lenz vector remains conserved for hydrogenic sys-
tems in these deceleration experiments [90].

Deceleration in time-dependent electric ﬁelds
By introducing time-dependent electric ﬁelds the eﬃciency of the deceleration pro-
cess could be signiﬁcantly enhanced, particularly for non-hydrogenic species [114].
Using time-dependent potentials, large, continuously moving, electric ﬁeld gradi-
ents could be generated at the position of the accelerating or decelerating Ryd-

berg atoms while ensuring that the strength of the ﬁeld was maintained below the
Inglis-Teller limit where non-hydrogenic contributions to the deceleration process
are most signiﬁcant [112]. Applying potentials which exponentially decayed in time
to a set of four electrodes in a quadrupole conﬁguration, Fig. 13(a-b), permitted
the mean longitudinal kinetic energy of beams of Ar atoms to be modiﬁed by up
to ∆Ekin/hc ∼ ±60 cm−1 [see Fig. 13(c)]. This change in kinetic energy is 2.7
times the Stark energy in the maximal ﬁeld experienced by the atoms during ac-
celeration/deceleration. In addition to ensuring that non-hydrogenic samples are
not subjected to ﬁelds larger than the Inglis-Teller ﬁeld during deceleration, time-
dependent ﬁelds can also be exploited to maximise the eﬃciency with which H
atoms, or other atoms or molecules in hydrogenic high-|m| states, can be deceler-
ated while ensuring that they do not experience ﬁelds that could result in ionisation
during deceleration.

Rydberg atom mirror
The use of time-dependent electric ﬁelds subsequently permitted the demonstration
of transverse focussing of beams of Ar atoms [115] and the reﬂection of beams of H
atoms in a normal incidence Rydberg atom mirror [116]. The arrangement of metal-
lic electrodes used to realise this mirror are depicted schematically in Fig. 14. In this
ﬁgure the beam of ground state H atoms propagates in the z-dimension between
the four mirror electrodes. At the time of photoexcitation, Fig. 14(a), a suﬃciently
homogeneous electric ﬁeld was generated at the position between electrodes 1 and 2
where the lasers used for Rydberg state photoexcitation crossed the atomic beam
(shaded circle between electrodes 1 and 2) to permit selective excitation of individ-
ual |n, k(cid:105) = |27, 18(cid:105) Rydberg-Stark states. After photoexcitation, pulsed potentials
of ±700 V were rapidly applied to electrodes 3 and 4 resulting in a large positive
electric ﬁeld gradient at the position of the excited atoms. This gradient caused
atoms in low-ﬁeld-seeking Rydberg-Stark states to decelerate and was large enough

that, if it persisted for a suﬃcient period of time, the atoms initially travelling
at 720 m/s could be decelerated to a standstill and reﬂected into the negative z-
dimension. In these experiments, Rydberg atoms located in the region between the
four electrodes were detected by pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation. This was achieved
by applying pulsed potentials of +1000 V to electrodes 1 and 2 simultaneously [see
Fig. 14(c) and (d)] generating a large ﬁeld to ionise the excited atoms and accel-
erate the resulting ions toward a MCP detector located further downstream in the
apparatus.

The operation of this Rydberg atom mirror can be most directly seen by compar-
ing the Rydberg atom ionisation signals with the mirror oﬀ, and with it active. When
oﬀ, the Rydberg atoms ﬂy through the region between the four electrodes where
they can be ionised by the pulsed electric ﬁeld, Fig. 14(c), within approximately
6 µs of photoexcitation [Fig. 15(a) positive-going time-of-ﬂight distributions]. On
the other hand, if the mirror potentials are activated to decelerated the atoms the
H+ ion signal persist for more than 10 µs [Fig. 15(a) inverted negative-going time-
of-ﬂight distributions]. This indicates that the electric ﬁeld gradient associated with
the Rydberg atom mirror decelerates the atoms suﬃciently that they remain within
the detection region for this longer period of time.

However, more detailed information on the longitudinal position of the Rydberg
atoms at each ionisation time can be extracted from the ion time-of-ﬂight distribu-
tions. In the case of the measurements with the mirror oﬀ, it can be seen in Fig. 15(a)
that the ﬂight-time of the H+ ions to the MCP detector (i.e., the time interval be-
tween each dashed vertical line and the subsequent maximum in the time-of-ﬂight

distribution) increases as the delay between excitation and pulsed electric ﬁeld ion-
isation increases. This occurs because when the Rydberg atoms move further into
the positive z dimension within the mirror electrodes, the H+ ions produced by
pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation are accelerated through a smaller electric potential
diﬀerence and therefore travel more slowly to the MCP. If the relation between the
ﬂight-time of the ions to the MCP and their position of ionisation is calibrated using
a beam with a known longitudinal speed, the position of the atoms at the time of
ionisation can be determined. With the mirror oﬀ, these positions are indicated by
the open red circles in Fig. 15(b).

With this in mind, it can be seen in the inverted negative-going dataset in
Fig. 15(a) recorded with the mirror activated, that although the ﬂight-times of
the ions to the MCP gradually increase for early ionisation times, at later times
they reduce again. This behaviour is indicative of the atoms ﬁrst moving forward
into the position z-dimension and then being reﬂected backwards. Making the ap-

propriate conversion from the mean time-of-ﬂight of the H+ ions, to the position of
ionisation, the trajectory of the ensemble of Rydberg atoms in the z-dimension could
be reconstructed [Fig. 15(b) ﬁlled black circles]. This shows that the atoms were
brought from their initial longitudinal speed of 720 m/s, to a stand still ∼ 1.75 mm
from their position of photoexcitation in a time of ∼ 4.5 µs. In this process they
experience an average acceleration of ∼ −1.5 × 108 m/s2.

Electrostatic trapping Rydberg atoms and molecules
Using time-dependent electric potentials permits deceleration of Rydberg atoms or
molecules in a continuously moving electric ﬁeld gradient. In the electrode conﬁgu-
ration used in the experiments described above these gradients form one side of a
travelling electric quadrupole trap [see e.g., Fig. 13(a)]. Such a trap is suitable for
conﬁning atoms or molecules in low-ﬁeld-seeking Rydberg-Stark states. Therefore,
if suﬃcient kinetic energy is removed in the deceleration process and quadrupole
electric ﬁeld distributions are generated with minima at the positions of the deceler-
ated samples, electrostatic trapping can be achieved using only a single deceleration
stage [118]. This is the operation principle upon which a set of on-axis and oﬀ-axis
three-dimensional electrostatic traps for Rydberg atoms and molecules have been
developed.

Trapping hydrogen and deuterium atoms
On-axis trap
The ﬁrst three-dimensional electrostatic trap for atoms in selected Rydberg-Stark
states was designed to act as a single-stage decelerator and a trap in which non-
zero electric ﬁeld minima could be generated [119]. The ﬁeld gradients around this
minimum gave rise to forces that conﬁned atoms or molecules in low-ﬁeld-seeking
states. The electric potentials used in the ﬁrst implementation of this device were
optimised for H atoms in states for which |n, k(cid:105) = |30, 25(cid:105). These states possess
electric dipole moments of ∼ 2900 D.
In these experiments, pulsed supersonic beams of H atoms with a mean longitu-
dinal velocity of 665 m/s were generated by photolysis of NH3 seeded in Ar [120].
After entering the electrode arrangement presented in Fig. 16(a) the atoms were
photoexcited to high Rydberg states using a resonance-enhanced two-colour two-
photon excitation scheme via the 2 2P1/2 level. The operation of the trap required
the application of potentials of +20 V (−20 V) to electrodes 1 and 4 (electrodes 2
and 3) to form a quadrupole electric ﬁeld distribution in the yz plane with its mini-
mum located at the mid-point between the four electrodes as in Fig. 16(b). To close
oﬀ the trap in the x dimension, and set the minimum electric ﬁeld to ∼ 9 V/cm,
electrodes 5 and 6 were operated at +55 V and −55 V, respectively [see Fig. 16(c)].
This ensured that a quantisation axis was maintained throughout the trap volume
and atoms would not be lost from the trap through non-adiabatic transitions to
untrapped high-ﬁeld-seeking states. In this conﬁguration the trap had a depth of
E/hc = 2.2 cm−1 (or E/kB = 3.2 K) for atoms in |n, k(cid:105) = |30, 25(cid:105) states.
To decelerate the Rydberg atoms and load them into this trap, shortly after pho-
toexcitation pulsed potentials of ±1265 V were applied to electrodes 3 and 4 (see
Fig. 17). This gave rise to a large positive electric-ﬁeld gradient along the z axis

in which atoms in low-ﬁeld-seeking states were decelerated. After being rapidly
switched on, these potentials decayed exponentially with a time constant of 1.9 µs.
This exponential decay was optimised so that the decelerating atoms were always
subjected to the maximum electric-ﬁeld gradient that could be generated in the
decelerator while never experiencing electric ﬁelds large enough to ionise them. The
time dependence of the acceleration experienced by the atoms during the deceler-
ation process was determined in numerical calculations of particle trajectories in
the decelerator and are presented in Fig. 18(a). The origin of the horizontal axis
in this ﬁgure represents the time at which the deceleration potentials applied to
electrodes 3 and 4 were switched on. The largest acceleration experienced by the
|n, k(cid:105) = |30, 25(cid:105) H Rydberg atoms was −5.5 × 107 m/s2 and they were decelerated
to zero velocity within ∼ 10 µs of the initial rise of the deceleration potentials,
after travelling ∼ 2.0 mm in the z dimension [see Fig.18(b)]. At the end of the
deceleration process, the potentials applied to electrodes 3 and 4 returned to their
initial values of ±20 V [see Fig. 17(b)]. Two unique and essential aspects of this de-
celeration and trapping procedure are (1) that the Rydberg-atom cloud is stopped
exactly at the minimum of the trap with no transverse loss of atoms in the ﬁnal

stages of trap loading, and (2) that the atoms never traverse regions of zero electric
ﬁeld and therefore do not undergo randomisation of k and m.

The presence of Rydberg atoms within the trap volume was detected by pulsed
electric-ﬁeld ionisation using potentials of +2 kV with rise times of 50 ns and
durations of ∼ 100 ns applied to electrodes 1 and 2 [see Fig.17(a)]. The resulting H+
ions were then accelerated toward a MCP detector with phosphor screen positioned
20 cm from the trap minimum along the z axis.

The integrated H+ signal recorded as a function of the time delay between
photoexcitation and ﬁeld ionisation in this on-axis electrostatic trap is presented
in Fig. 19 (open circles). Initially, the atom number density in the trap is
106 − 107 cm−3. Fitting a single exponential function to the data beyond 200 µs in
this ﬁgure reveals two time periods in which the trap loss rates are quite diﬀerent.
At early times, up to ∼ 150 µs, a rapid loss of atoms from the trap occurs which
was seen to be strongly dependent on the density of the atomic beam [118]. This
loss of atoms at early trapping times was attributed to collisions with the trailing
components of the gas pulse. Beyond 200 µs the exponential function ﬁtted to the
experimental data has a time constant of 135 µs. This rate of decay of atoms from
the trap results from a combination of the ﬂuorescence lifetime of the Rydberg
states prepared at photoexcitation, the rate at which transitions driven by the local
room-temperature blackbody radiation ﬁeld occur, and interactions between the
trapped atoms.

In these experiments information on the transverse motion of the ensemble of
trapped atoms could be obtained by H+ ion imaging. Such data, together with
a corresponding set of calculated ion images are displayed in Fig. 20(a) and (b),
respectively. With potentials of ±55 V applied to electrodes 5 and 6, atoms located

experienced strong electric-ﬁeld gradients that forced them toward the centre of the
trap, compressing the cloud in this dimension. Under the conditions in which the
trap was operated this motion of the ensemble had a period of ∼ 100 µs. This can
be seen in the experimental data in Fig. 20(a) which were recorded at time intervals
of 5 µs. At early times, the cloud of trapped atoms ﬁlls the trap in the x-dimension.
As the atoms are forced toward the centre of the trap, the spatial spread of the ions
impinging on the MCP detector reduces until it reaches its minimal size 60 − 70 µs
after excitation. A similar behaviour is seen in the calculated images, validating the
interpretation of the experimental data.

In detecting trapped atoms by pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation, the ion time-of-
ﬂight distributions can also be exploited to provide information on the location
and spatial distribution of the Rydberg atoms at the time of ionisation [113]. By
switching oﬀ the trap and allowing the cloud of Rydberg atoms to expand before
the ionising electric ﬁeld was applied, the rate of expansion in the z dimension
could be measured directly. These measurements indicated that the radius of the
Rydberg atom cloud increased at a rate of 50 m/s after the trap was switched oﬀ.
This corresponds to a mean kinetic energy of ∆Ekin/kB ∼ 150 mK of the atoms.

Oﬀ-axis trap
To isolate and minimise contributions from collisions of trapped atoms with the
trailing components of the atomic beams employed in these experiments, and dis-
tinguish collisional losses from trap decay driven by blackbody radiation, an oﬀ-axis
trap which could be cooled to low-temperatures was developed [105, 121]. The de-
sign of this device is presented in Fig. 21(a) as it was initially employed to decelerate
beams of H atoms from initial longitudinal speeds of ∼ 600 m/s. In this decelerator
and oﬀ-axis trap the laser beams required for Rydberg state photoexcitation entered
the excitation region through a set of 1.6-mm-diameter holes in electrodes 1, 2, and
7. Following photoexcitation, a series of pulsed electric potentials were applied to
decelerate, deﬂect and load the Rydberg atoms into the oﬀ-axis trap located 6 mm
away from the initial propagation axis of the atomic beam.

The sequence of pulsed potentials used for deceleration and trap loading could be
tailored to trap atoms on-axis, between electrodes 1–4, or oﬀ-axis between electrodes

2, 4, 7, and 8. The pulsed time-dependent potentials required for oﬀ-axis trapping
can be seen in Fig. 21(b). At the times of photoexcitation and trapping [Fig. 22(b)],
potentials of +12 V (-12 V) were applied to electrodes 1, 4, and 7 (2, 3, and 8)
forming two electric quadrupole traps in the yz plane, with minima located at the
midpoint between electrodes 1–4 (on-axis trap) and 2, 4, 7, 8 (oﬀ-axis trap). End-
cap electrodes [not shown in Fig. 21(a)], were located above (below) the on-axis and
oﬀ-axis traps, separated by 10 mm in the x dimension, and operated at potentials of
−22 V (+22 V) to achieve conﬁnement of the Rydberg atom cloud in the x direction
and generate a ﬁeld of 10 V/cm at the trap minimum. This represented the electric
ﬁeld conﬁguration for the ﬁrst of 5 phases of trap loading. After photoexcitation
[t = 0 µs in Fig. 21(b)], initial longitudinal deceleration took place (0 < t < 5 µs).
This was followed by guiding of the atoms oﬀ axis (5 µs < t < 15 µs), transverse
deceleration to the position of the oﬀ-axis trap (15 µs < t < 25 µs), and oﬀ-axis
trapping (t ≥ 25 µs). The electric-ﬁeld distributions in the yz plane at the beginning
of each of these ﬁve phases are displayed in Fig. 22(a-d).

The presence of Rydberg atoms in this oﬀ-axis trap was measured by pulsed
electric ﬁeld ionisation following the application of pulsed ionisation potentials of
+2 kV to electrodes 2 and 7 with the resulting H+ ions collected on a MCP detector
[see Fig. 21(a)]. The results of measurements of this kind for a range of time delays
between photoexcitation and pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation are presented in Fig. 19
(ﬁlled black circles). The data in this ﬁgure, all recorded following deceleration and
trapping of H atoms initially prepared in low-ﬁeld-seeing n = 30 Rydberg-Stark
states, permits a direct comparison to be made between the decay of atoms from
the on-axis trap with that from the oﬀ-axis trap. In these data sets, the decay rates
from the two traps are identical at times beyond 170 µs with the diﬀerence at early
times evidence for collisional losses of ∼ 40% from the on-axis trap induced by the

trailing component of atomic beam. This rapid decay of atoms from the trap at
early times is suppressed by trapping oﬀ-axis.

Although the rates of decay of electrostatically trapped atoms at later times in
Fig. 19 are on the same order of magnitude as those associated with ﬂuorescence
from the initially prepared Rydberg-Stark states, no dependence of the decay rate
on the value of n was observed in this work. This suggested that decay channels
other than ﬂuorescence must play a role in the experiments. Because of the sen-
sitivity of the trapped Rydberg atoms to room temperature blackbody radiation,
these additional decay channels were attributed to transitions driven by blackbody
radiation. However, contributions from Rydberg-Rydberg interactions could also
not be excluded at early times.

The eﬀect of the blackbody temperature of the surroundings of the oﬀ-axis trap
on the rate of decay of H atoms conﬁned within it can be seen in Fig. 23(a). As the
blackbody temperature is reduced from room temperature, to 125 K and 11 K, the
period of time for which atoms remain in the trap increases. Consequently, the trap
decay rate reduces. Since the strongest transitions induced by blackbody radiation
between Rydberg states in the presence of an electric ﬁeld tend be between states
with similar electric dipole moments, such transitions do not lead directly to a loss
of atoms from the trap. These transitions lead instead to a gradual redistribution
of the Rydberg state population among states with a range of values of n. At room
temperature, this redistribution renders the measured trapping times largely inde-
pendent of the value of n. Therefore the primary blackbody radiation contribution
to the loss of trapped atoms at room temperature in Fig. 23(a) is direct blackbody
photoionisation. For states with values of n close to 30, photoionisation accounts
for approximately 8% of the blackbody-radiation–induced depopulation rate in a
300 K environment [18, 106, 123]. As the blackbody temperature of the environ-
ment is reduced the contributions from blackbody photoionisation also reduce. In

the data recorded at 125 K and 11 K in Fig. 23(a) the decrease in the decay rate
observed at longer trapping times is a result of the slow redistribution of population
among states with a range of values of n at these temperatures. As the population is
redistributed, atoms de-excited to states with lower values of n decay more rapidly
from the trap. Consequently, at later times only atoms in states with the highest
values of n, which decay more slowly, remain. At 11 K, the initially prepared states
are preserved for ∼ 500 µs after which time the measured decay rates represent the
average rate of decay of the states to which the population has been redistributed
following blackbody transitions.

To conﬁrm that the measured rates of decay of atoms from the oﬀ-axis trap are
dominated by radiative processes and not aﬀected by the dynamics of the trapped
atoms, experiments were also performed with D atoms in states with the same
values of n [121]. A direct comparison between the rate of decay of H and D atoms
initially prepared in Rydberg-Stark states for which n = 30 from an oﬀ-axis trap
cooled to 125 K can be seen in Fig. 23(b). This indicates that the heavier D atoms
can also be eﬃciently trapped, and the diﬀering dynamics of the ensembles of H
and D atoms in the trap, resulting from their slightly diﬀerent trajectories into the
trap, do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect measurements of their decay.

Evidence for the redistribution of the Rydberg state population toward higher
values of n at longer trapping times when T = 125 K can be seen in measurements
carried out using slowly-rising ionisation electric-ﬁeld pulses to project the distri-
bution of Rydberg states onto the H+ ion time-of-ﬂight distribution. The results
of such measurements, performed with the trap electrodes and surrounding heat
shields cooled to 125 K, are presented in Fig. 24. The set of data in Fig. 24(a) are
reference measurements recorded after a trapping time of 50 µs for initially excited
Rydberg states with values of n ranging from 30 to 37. The slowly-rising electric
potential applied to electrodes 2 and 7 to ionise the atoms from the oﬀ-axis trap
and extract the resulting ions toward the MCP detector is presented in Fig. 24(b).

states ionise later. The ionisation times are then mapped onto the ion time-of-ﬂight
distributions such that ions detected at earlier (later) times correspond to atoms
with higher (lower) values of n. At 125 K blackbody-radiation–induced transitions
do occur during the ﬁrst 50 µs trapping time. However, although this results in
a broadening of the ion time-of-ﬂight distributions, the maximum of each distri-
bution still correspond approximately to the detection time of the initially excited
Rydberg state. For increasing values of n the maximum of the corresponding ion
time-of-ﬂight distribution therefore shifts to earlier times as indicated by the lo-
cations of the red vertical lines in Fig. 24(a). From these measurements a H+ ion
ﬂight time can be associated with atoms in each n state present in the trap. This
information can then be employed to investigate the time evolution of a single ini-
tially excited Rydberg state as shown for n = 30 in Fig. 24(c). In this ﬁgure, the red
vertical lines denote the arrival times of the ions produced by pulsed-ﬁeld-ionisation
of Rydberg states from n = 30 to n = 37 as determined from Fig. 24(a). After a
trapping time of 50 µs, a signiﬁcant number of ions arrive at the MCP detector
with short ﬂight times indicating the presence of Rydberg states with n > 30 in the
trap. However, the larger fraction of the atoms are still in states for which n = 30.
After a trapping time of 100 µs, an increase in the relative intensity of the signal
corresponding to Rydberg states for which n > 30 is observed. A further increase
in this signal is seen after increasing the trapping time to 150 µs. At these longer
trapping times, the larger fraction of the trapped atoms are in states with n > 33.

n, there is a larger probability that they will remain in the trap. This upward shift
of the mean value of n in the ensemble of trapped atoms with time gives rise to a
reduction in the trap-loss rate by spontaneous emission, and the non-exponential
decay of atoms from the trap seen in Fig. 19.

Trapping hydrogen molecules
The phase-space acceptance of the on-axis and oﬀ-axis traps described above makes
them also well suited to deceleration and trapping molecular hydrogen. By prepar-
ing pulsed supersonic beams of H2 seeded in Kr, samples with initial kinetic
energies equal to those of beams of D atoms can readily be prepared. To de-
celerate and electrostatically trap these H2 molecules hydrogenic Rydberg-Stark
states with |MJ| = 3 were prepared using the three-photon excitation scheme in
Eq. (20) [98, 101]. This required the generation of coherent, circularly polarised
radiation in the vacuum-ultraviolet (vuv) (94093 cm−1 ≡ 106.28 nm), visible
(18190 cm−1 ≡ 549.75 nm), and infrared (∼ 1200 cm−1 ≡ 833 nm) regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum, for each step, respectively. In the experiments in which
this photoexcitation scheme has been employed, the visible and infrared laser ra-
diation was directly generated using two tuneable nanosecond pulsed dye lasers.
The circularly polarised vuv radiation was generated by resonance enhanced sum-
frequency mixing in Xe [98]. By propagating each of these laser beams through
1.5 mm diameter holes in the electrodes surrounding the photoexcitation region the
quantisation axis deﬁned by the laser beams coincided with that deﬁned by the
electric ﬁeld at the position of photoexcitation. The use of this excitation geometry
ensured the selective photoexcitation of nf |MJ| = 3 Rydberg states converging to
the N + = 0, 2 and 4 rotational states of the X 2Σ+

g (v+ = 0) H+

2 ion core.

The procedure employed to decelerate the H2 molecules into the on-axis electro-
static trap is the same as that described above for the deceleration and electrostatic

trapping of H Rydberg atoms. However, because the initial longitudinal velocities
of the beams of H2 generated by seeding in Kr were 500 m/s, and lower than those
of the beams of H atoms above, the time constant characterising the exponential
decay of the deceleration potentials was increased to 3.65 µs.

In these experiments Rydberg states with a wide range of values of n could be
decelerated and trapped with any given deceleration pulse sequence. For example,
when optimised to decelerate and trap molecules in states for which n (cid:39) 30, states
with similar electric dipole moments and values of n in the range from n = 21–37
could also be trapped [101]. For many spectroscopy and scattering experiments,
or studies of excited state decay processes, it is desirable to prepare decelerated
samples in selected Stark states. As can be seen in Fig. 25, this has been demon-
strated in H2 for states with n = 22. Upon photoexcitation in a ﬁeld of 278 V/cm
and detection after a time delay of 3 µs, all 19 accessible n = 22 Stark states for
which |MJ| = 3, with values of k from −18 to +18, are resolved [spectrum (i) of
Fig. 25(a)]. Spectra (ii) and (iii) in Fig. 25(a) were then recorded by monitoring the

(see Fig. 16), molecules excited to the four outermost low-ﬁeld-seeking Stark states
(k = 12 − 18) were trapped eﬃciently [spectrum (ii)]. Increasing the deceleration
potentials to ±2.3 kV enabled the generation of larger electric ﬁeld gradients and
therefore also eﬃcient trapping of molecules in Rydberg-Stark states with k = 10
[spectrum (iii)], the dipole moment of which was too small for eﬃcient trapping
with the lower potentials. The experimentally observed deceleration eﬃciency for
each Stark state is fully accounted for in calculations of particle trajectories in the
decelerator and trap, the results of which are displayed in Fig. 25(b). Comparison of
the results of these calculations with the experimental data leads to the conclusion
that the calculations capture all essential aspects of the deceleration and trapping
process, including the dynamics at avoided crossings. Indeed, the range of maximal
electric ﬁelds experiences by molecules within the excited ensemble during deceler-
ation and trap loading, indicated by the think lines in Fig. 25(c), show that many
molecules are subjected to ﬁelds beyond the Inglis-Teller limit. The dynamics at
the avoided crossings in these ﬁelds were treated using a Landau-Zener model in
the calculations [98, 125, 126].

Figure 26 Decay of trapped H2 molecules. Measurements of the number of H+
2 ions detected
following pulsed electric ﬁeld ionisation of H2 molecules from an on-axis electrostatic trap in a
room temperature environment. Dataset A (B) was recorded with the pulsed valve operated at a
stagnation pressure of 4.0 bar (1.75 bar). From Ref. [101].

ionisation of the trapped molecules for a range of times after photoexcitation. From
the data recorded with the lower density molecular beam (dataset B – for which
the pulsed valve was operated at a stagnation pressure of 4 bar), a trap decay
constant of τ1/e = 40 µs was determined. If spontaneous emission to lower n levels,
with |MJ| = 2 − 4 and hence n ≥ 3, were the only decay processes, trapping times
exceeding 300 µs would be expected. The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between this time
and that measured experimentally indicates that decay by spontaneous emission is
not the dominant trap-loss mechanism.

As in the trapping experiments carried out in a room temperature environment
with H and D atoms, transitions driven by blackbody radiation can aﬀect the decay
of the H2 molecules from this on-axis trap. However, while the overall blackbody
depopulation rates of the initially prepared Stark states are expected to be similar
to those for H or D, the eﬀects of these transitions on the decay of the H2 molecules
from the trap are diﬀerent. This is because in the hydrogenic Rydberg-Stark states
of H2 prepared, blackbody-radiation-induced transitions to |MJ| = 2 Rydberg states
which can decay by predissociation can occur. Under the assumption that approx-
imately one third of the blackbody-radiation-induced transitions are ∆MJ = −1
transitions one can conclude that ∼ 33% of the blackbody-radiation-induced de-
population rate results in trap loss, leading to an expected decay time greater than
100 µs.

Because the trap loss rates in Fig. 26 are higher than those expected by the
combination of spontaneous emission and blackbody-radiation-induced loss, and a
signiﬁcant dependence of the trap decay rate on the stagnation pressure at which
the pulsed valve was operated, and hence the density of the molecular beam, was
observed (compare dataset A and dataset B), it must be concluded that collisional

Hogan

Page 37 of 53

losses also play a signiﬁcant role in these on-axis trapping experiments. In addition,
it is also possible that slow predissociation of the |MJ| = 3 plays a minor part in
the trap decay. Collisional losses can occur either through dipole-dipole interactions
between trapped Rydberg molecules or via interactions of the Rydberg molecules,
with atoms and molecules in the trailing components of the gas pulse.

To disentangle these competing decay processes, experiments have recently been
performed by Seiler, Merkt and co-workers with H2 molecules trapped in an oﬀ-
axis electrostatic trap the electrodes of which were cooled to 11 K [127]. This work
indicates that, as in the H and D atom trapping experiments, under these conditions
H2 trapping times exceeding 1 ms are achievable. These experiments now open up
a wide range of opportunities for studies of the eﬀects of collisions and blackbody
transitions on the decay of long-lived hydrogenic molecular Rydberg states on time-
scales that were not previously possible.

Chip-based guides, decelerators and traps
Controlled manipulation of the motional degrees of freedom and internal quantum
states of atoms and molecules at vacuum–solid-state interfaces is of importance in
several areas of research. Robust and scaleable chip-based electric and magnetic
traps and guides have been developed for atomic ions [128] and neutral ground
state atoms [129]. These devices have been exploited, e.g., in quantum information
processing [130] and quantum metrology [131]. In addition, the preparation of cold,
velocity-controlled samples of polar molecules using chip-based Stark decelerators
has been demonstrated as a route “towards a gas phase molecular laboratory on
a chip” [132, 133, 134]. Approaches directed toward the conﬁnement of Rydberg
atoms in the vicinity of surfaces have involved Rydberg photoexcitation in miniature
vapor cells [49], and in close proximity to arrays of surface-based permanent-magnet
traps [135]. Atom chips have also been developed with Rydberg photoexcitation in
the strong dipole-blockade regime in mind [136, 137], and for the realisation of
sources of single atoms on demand [138].

In this context chip-based Rydberg-Stark decelerators have also recently been
developed. These devices are composed of arrays of metallic electrodes on electrically
insulating substrates and have been used to accelerate, decelerate and trap pulsed
beams of H [139] and He atoms [87, 140], and H2 molecules [141] in continuously
moving electric traps. Electrostatic trapping at zero mean velocity has also been
achieved. These devices are scalable in their construction and therefore well suited
to the deceleration of samples with high initial kinetic energies, they can be readily
conﬁgured to implement complex decelerator or trap geometries, and because the
atoms or molecules are always localised about an electric ﬁeld minimum during
deceleration they permit control over the motion of samples in states with a very
wide range of principal quantum numbers without losses by electric ﬁeld ionisation.
The design and operation principle of the ﬁrst chip-based decelerator developed
for Rydberg atoms and molecules built on those of chip-based Stark decelerators
for polar ground state molecules [132, 134]. However, because the electric dipole
moments of the Rydberg states employed in the experiments were three orders
of magnitude larger than those of the polar molecules decelerated in these other
chip-based Stark decelerators (e.g., CO∗ [142]), the electrode dimensions and their

spacing could be scaled up, and the amplitudes of the electric potentials applied

for deceleration and trapping scaled down, so that entire ensembles of atoms or

molecules to be decelerated could be loaded into individual travelling traps of the

decelerator. The resulting device, depicted schematically in Fig. 27(a), was com-

posed of 11 electrodes each with a width of 0.5 mm in the z-dimension, and a
center-to-center spacing dz = 1.0 mm. These dimensions were chosen to match
the decelerator acceptance to the phase-space characteristics a beam of H Rydberg

atoms. As can be seen in Fig. 27(a), the ends of the electrodes in the x dimension

were enlarged to reduce the oscillatory motion of the minima in this dimension

during deceleration.

The decelerator was operated by applying six oscillating electric potentials, Vi, to
electrodes numbered i = 1 − 6 in Fig. 27(a), and repeating the sequence from the
seventh electrode on. These potentials have the general form

where 2V0 is the peak-to-peak potential, ω is the oscillation angular frequency, and
φi = (1 − i)2π/3 is the phase shift from one electrode to the next [132]. Using this
conﬁguration of time-dependent electric potentials, a set of moving electric traps,
separated by a distance of 3dz = 3 mm, were generated above the two-dimensional
array of electrodes, as depicted in Fig. 28. The activation time of the decelerator
potentials was selected to ensure that all of the excited Rydberg atoms were loaded
into a single trap. As the potentials oscillated in time, this trap moved in the
positive z dimension with a velocity vz = 3dzω/(2π). Acceleration/deceleration, az,
was achieved by applying a linear frequency chirp to the time-dependent potentials
such that

ω(t) = ω0 + (2π/3dz)azt,

where ω0 corresponds to the initial velocity vi. An example of a set of potentials
tailored for deceleration from vi = 760 m/s to a ﬁnal velocity vf = 300 m/s is

erated frame of reference has a signiﬁcant eﬀect at all times throughout the accel-
eration/deceleration process. As in other chip-based Stark decelerators [132, 134]
this eﬀect of the acceleration of the moving trap, (cid:126)atrap, is most readily seen in the
moving frame of reference associated with a single electric ﬁeld minimum of the
decelerator. The transformation from the laboratory-ﬁxed frame of reference to this
moving frame is achieved by adding the pseudo potential

Vpseudo = m (cid:126)atrap · (cid:126)s,

(24)

where m is the mass of the atom or molecule being decelerated, and (cid:126)s is the dis-
placement from this local ﬁeld minimum. Potential energy distributions associated
with such an electric ﬁeld minimum in this moving frame of reference of the surface-
electrode Rydberg-Stark decelerator are presented in Fig. 29 for accelerations of 0,
−5 × 105, −5 × 106 and −5 × 107 m/s2. In this ﬁgure, the contour lines are spaced
by E/kB = 1 K and begin at 1 K. For H atoms in |n, k(cid:105) = |33, 26(cid:105) states for which
the decelerator was designed, the shape and size of the moving trap does not sig-
niﬁcantly change for accelerations from 0 to −5 × 105 m/s2 [Fig. 29(a) and (b)].
However, the shape of the trap begins to distort for accelerations of −5 × 106 m/s2
and larger [Fig. 29(c)] with a signiﬁcant reduction in size for an acceleration of
−5 × 107 m/s2. For higher Rydberg states with |n, k(cid:105) = |50, 40(cid:105), which can also be
eﬃciently decelerated, the moving trap generated using the same electric potentials
applied to the electrodes is deeper, and even for an acceleration of −5× 107 m/s2 is
only slightly distorted [Fig. 29(e-h)]. To assess the suitability of such a decelerator
for the manipulation of beams of heavy atoms or molecules, the potential energy
distributions for Xe atoms in |n, k(cid:105) = |50, 40(cid:105) states are presented in Fig. 29(i)
and (j) and indicate that accelerations of up to −5× 105 m/s2 are feasible with this
device, making it suitable for the deceleration of heavy samples.

The operation of this surface-electrode decelerator was investigated experimen-
tally by measuring the times-of-ﬂight of beams of H Rydberg atoms from their
position of photoexcitation to that of electric ﬁeld ionisation (see Fig. 27). A set of
data corresponding to acceleration/deceleration from vi = 760 m/s to ﬁnal veloci-
ties between 1 200 m/s and 200 m/s, is presented in Fig. 30(a). These measurements
only diﬀer in the frequency chirp used to achieve the desired ﬁnal longitudinal speed.
The time-of-ﬂight distribution labelled (iii) corresponds to the undecelerated beam
of Rydberg atoms, detected after a ﬂight time of ∼ 29 µs (vertical dotted line).
This measurement was made with the decelerator oﬀ and its intensity is scaled by
a factor of 0.5 with respect to the other measurements. Measurements (i) and (ii)
were performed to accelerate the atoms to vf = 1 200 and 1 000 m/s, respectively.
In these cases the accelerated atoms arrived at the detection region earlier than
the undecelerated atoms, at times of ∼ 26 and ∼ 27.5 µs, respectively. The upper
four time-of-ﬂight distributions (iv)–(vii) correspond to deceleration to vf = 600,
450, 300 and 200 m/s and indicate progressively later arrival times of the deceler-
ated atoms of 33, 38, 45 and 54 µs, respectively. The intensity of the distribution
corresponding to deceleration to vf = 200 m/s is scaled by a factor of four.

Calculations of three-dimensional particle-trajectories and the corresponding
time-of-ﬂight distributions [Fig. 30(b)] capture the essential features of the ex-
perimental data and provide a basis for their interpretation. Comparison of the
experimental data with the results of the calculations indicate that the peak ob-
served in all traces at ∼ 29 µs corresponds to atoms which traverse the decelerator
at a position beyond the saddle point of the moving traps in the y dimension (i.e., at
y > 1.2 mm). These atoms follow metastable trajectories across the decelerator and
arrive at the ﬁeld-ionisation point without acceleration or deceleration. The second
peak in each time-of-ﬂight distribution corresponds to the accelerated/decelerated
atoms. The velocities at each maximum [indicated by the arrows in Fig. 30(b)] ex-
actly match the ﬁnal velocities for which the deceleration potentials were designed.
At low ﬁnal velocities, the ensemble of decelerated atoms expand in the longitudinal
and transverse dimensions as they ﬂy from the end of the device to the detection
region. Transverse expansion after deceleration is accompanied by particle loss and
leads to a reduction of the overall signal. This behaviour is also reproduced in the
calculations.

Following these initial deceleration and trapping experiments this surface-
electrode decelerator was extended to include an array of 44 electrodes [140]. This
longer device permitted the removal of larger amounts of kinetic energy than in pre-
vious decelerators and therefore complete deceleration and trapping of fast beams
of He atoms in singlet Rydberg states moving at initial speeds of 1200 m/s. In this
work, the deceleration of samples to zero longitudinal velocity in the laboratory-
ﬁxed frame of reference, and on-axis trapping was demonstrated in a way that was

similar to that employed previously to trap H Rydberg atoms [139]. After the traps
in which the atoms were decelerated were brought to a stand still, they remained
stationary for a selected period of time, the trapping time, ttrap, in Fig. 31. To detect
the trapped atoms by pulsed electric-ﬁeld ionisation, the traps were subsequently
re-accelerated along the axis of the apparatus to 400 m/s and the atoms then re-
leased into an electric ﬁeld ionisation detection region similar to that in Fig. 27.
From the complete time-of-ﬂight distributions of the atoms for a set of selected
trapping times, information on the decay of atoms from the stationary traps could
be determined. The time constants (τ1/e ∼ 25 µs) associated with the observed
trap decay in these experiments were shorter than the calculated lifetimes of the
states prepared at photoexcitation (τ1/e ∼ 58 µs). This is a result of the combined
eﬀects of collisions with the trailing components of the atomic beam arising from
on-axis deceleration and trapping, and transitions driven by the room temperature
blackbody radiation ﬁeld in the environment of the decelerator.

With a view to using curved, surface-electrode Rydberg-Stark decelerators to pre-
pare velocity-controlled samples of Rydberg atoms and molecules for merged beam
collision experiments (see e.g., [143]) devices with curvatures perpendicular to the
plane of the electrode surfaces have recently been implemented to transport, decel-
erate and deﬂect beams of H2 molecules in high Rydberg states [141]. A schematic

is displayed in Fig. 32. The H2 molecules in these experiments were photoexcited
to n = 31 Rydberg-Stark states between a pair of parallel metallic plates [region
(i) in Fig. 32] using the photoexcitation scheme in Eq. 20. The excited molecules
were then loaded into a single moving electric trap of the surface-electrode deceler-
ator and transported along the device. In this process the molecules were deﬂected
away from the initial propagation axis of the molecular beam. Images of the un-
deﬂected and deﬂected molecules were then recorded at a MCP detector when the
decelerator was oﬀ, and when it was activated, respectively. The information ob-
tained from these images was then used to characterise the transverse acceptance of
the decelerator and determine the phase-space properties of the guided molecules.
An example of such an image, recorded with the decelerator active, is included in
Fig. 32. Comparisons of the data recorded in these experiments with the results
of numerical calculations of the trajectories of the molecules in the device show
excellent agreement. The resulting velocity-controlled beams of cold, state-selected
molecules, deﬂected away from their initial axis of propagation by an angle of 10◦
had translational temperatures of ∼ 250 mK and appear very well suited for use in
studies of ion-molecule reactions at low collision energies [141].

Most recently, a second kind of chip-based Rydberg-Stark decelerator has been
developed. This design of this device, which can be seen in Fig. 33, is based on
the geometry of a two-dimensional electrical transmission line. This design makes
it well suited to integration with chip-based microwave circuits (see e.g., Ref. [39]).
This transmission-line geometry was ﬁrst implemented in the form of an electro-
static guide for Rydberg atoms or molecules [144]. This device was composed of an
electrical transmission line with a continuous center conductor and permitted the
transverse positions of beams of Rydberg atoms to be controlled. By then segment-
ing the center conductor of the transmission line to form an array of square, equally

spaced electrodes, a device in which Rydberg atoms or molecules can be trans-
ported, accelerated and decelerated while conﬁned in continuously moving electric
traps was realised. The resulting transmission-line decelerator operates on a similar
principle to the surface-electrode devices described above, but oﬀers the advantages
of stronger transverse conﬁnement, resulting in symmetric traps in all three spatial
dimensions [compare Fig. 28 with Fig. 33(b) and (c)], and opportunities for the in-
troduction of curvatures in the plane of the two-dimensional electrode arrays from
which it is composed. Because atoms or molecules in this decelerator are conveyed
in the void between a two-dimensional electrode array and a parallel plane metal
plate it lends itself well to cooling to low temperature, directly shielding the samples
within it from their surroundings. It also provides a very well deﬁned electromag-
netic environment in which to manipulated and trap Rydberg atoms and molecules.
This characteristic is a prerequisite for identifying and precisely controlling eﬀects
of blackbody radiation on the trapped samples.

The transmission-line decelerators constructed up to now employ 1 mm square
center-conductor segments with center-to-center spacings of dcc = 2 mm. The insu-
lating gap between these segments and the ground planes was also selected to be
1 mm, while the upper plane metal plate was positioned 4.5 mm above this electrode
array. In this geometry the formation of a three-dimensional electric ﬁeld minimum
can be achieved by applying equal non-zero electric potentials to one single seg-
ment of the center conductor and the upper plate while all other electrodes are set
to 0 V. However, if a constant potential of Vu = −V0/2 is applied to the upper
plate electrode, with potentials of 0 V on the two ground planes, and potentials of
Vi = V0 cos[−(i − 1)φ] on the segments of the center conductor, where φ = 2π/5 is
the phase-shift from one decelerator segment, i, to the next, arrays of electric traps
spaced by 5dcc are generated within the device.

To realise a continuous motion of this array of traps through the decelerator, the
electric potentials applied to the segments of the center conductor are set to oscillate

in time at an angular frequency ω, such that,

Vi(t) = V0 cos[ωt − (i − 1)φ].

(25)

In this conﬁguration the speed, vtrap, at which the traps move through the deceler-
ator is then

vtrap = 5dcc/(2π).

(26)

To ensure that the traps remain a constant distance above the two-dimensional
electrode array as they travel through the decelerator the potentials applied to the
ground planes are modulated at a frequency, ωgp = 5ω, and with an amplitude of
−0.045V0.
Using a curved decelerator of this design He Rydberg atoms in n = 52 Stark
states with electric dipole moments of ∼ 6900 D have been velocity selected and
guided at constant speed with the results presented in Fig. 34(a). The upper panel,
(i), of this ﬁgure contains the time-of-ﬂight distribution of the ensemble of initially
prepared He Rydberg atoms from their position of photoexcitation to the end of
the decelerator with the device oﬀ. The results of loading components of this veloc-
ity distribution into individual continuously-moving traps of the decelerator, and
guiding them through the device at constant speed can be seen in panel (ii). To
convey atoms at a constant speed of 1950 m/s through this device required that
ω = 2π × 195 kHz. In the experiments, these oscillating potentials were generated
at low voltage using a set of arbitrary waveform generators before ampliﬁcation by

a factor of 50 to amplitudes of up to V0 = 120 V. In the data presented in Fig. 34(a)
eﬀects of the Rydberg atom density on the eﬃciency with which the ensembles are
guided can be seen. This highlights the importance of identifying and minimising
the eﬀects of collisions between the trapped atoms in experiments of this kind,
particularly at these high values of n [145].

As in the surface-electrode decelerators discussed above, by introducing frequency
chirps to the time-dependent electric potentials, the moving electric traps can be
accelerated or decelerated as they travel through the device. For a selected initial
speed, vtrap(0), and an acceleration, atrap, the time-dependence of the oscillation
frequency is

where ω(0) = 2πvtrap(0)/(5dcc) is the initial angular frequency. Data recorded for
the acceleration and deceleration of beams of triplet He atoms in |n, k(cid:105) = |52, 35(cid:105)
Stark states initially moving at 1950 m/s are presented in Fig. 34(b). As can be seen
from this data, increasing the acceleration of the traps toward |atrap| = 2×107 m/s2
leads to a reduction in the intensity of the time-of-ﬂight signals. This is a conse-
quence of the eﬀective reduction in the depths of the moving traps with acceleration
as discussed above in the context of the surface-electrode decelerators (see, e.g.,
Fig. 29). In the curved transmission-line decelerator employed in these experiments
it was necessary to consider the combined eﬀects of the applied tangential acceler-
ation, and the centripetal accelerations arising from the curvature of the device, on
the decelerating atoms. For the Rydberg states prepared in the experiments, the
maximum acceleration that could be applied before the traps opened completely
was |atrap| (cid:39) 2.35 × 107 m/s2.
In these transmission-line decelerators, atomic beams with speeds exceeding
2500 m/s have been manipulated and changes in kinetic energy of up to Ekin ∼
1.3 × 10−20 J (≡ 80 meV or ≡ 650 cm−1) have been achieved. This makes them
very well suited to the transport, acceleration and trapping of a wide range of atoms
and molecules. At present transmission-line decelerators with in situ detection are
being developed and tested, and possibilities for the implementation of chip-based
storage-rings, and beam-splitters are foreseen. These devices, when combined with
co-planar microwave circuitry represent a unique chip-based laboratory with which
comprehensive control over the translational motion and internal quantum states
of gas-phase Rydberg atoms and molecules can be achieved.

Conclusions
The methods for accelerating, decelerating and trapping Rydberg atoms and
molecules initially travelling in pulsed supersonic beams using inhomogeneous elec-
tric ﬁelds that are reviewed here, open many exciting possibilities for new experi-
mental investigations at the interface between physics and physical chemistry. In the
process of developing these techniques measurements have been made of the roles
that collisions and transitions driven by blackbody radiation play on the evolution
and decay of excited states of atoms and molecules on timescales that were not pre-
viously possible. The translationally cold, velocity-controlled beams that can now

be prepared by Rydberg-Stark deceleration oﬀer opportunities for investigations of
eﬀects of collisions, blackbody radiation and electric and magnetic ﬁelds on slow-
dissociation processes in long-lived Rydberg states of molecules, and provide an in-
triguing route to studies of ion-molecule reactions in merged beams [141]. Tuneable,
velocity-controlled beams of atoms and molecules in high Rydberg states provide
opportunities for studies of the eﬀects of image states, and the velocity dependence
of surface-ionisation processes [56]. In addition, the de-excitation of molecular sam-
ples back to their ground states after Rydberg-Stark deceleration represents a route
toward to the production of cold samples of ground-state molecules.

In hybrid approaches to quantum information processing involving Rydberg atoms
and microwave circuits, the chip-based Rydberg atom guides and decelerators de-
scribed can be used to transport atoms within cryogenic environments operated a
diﬀerent blackbody temperatures, and with diﬀering cooling capacities. Recent im-
plementations of electrostatic charged-wire guides for atoms or molecules in high-
ﬁeld-seeking Rydberg-Stark states [146] oﬀer potential opportunities for studies of
angular-momentum quantisation in non-commutative space [147, 148, 149]. Demon-
strations of focussing, decelerating and trapping fast-moving beams of Rydberg
atoms highlight the possibility of employing Rydberg-Stark deceleration methods
in the manipulation of samples of positronium atoms for precision spectroscopic
studies and investigations of the acceleration of particles composed of antimatter
in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [81].

In the reﬁnement of the techniques of Rydberg-Stark deceleration and electric
trapping for application in each of the above areas, it will be important to study
and account for the eﬀects of electric-ﬁeld noise on the energy level structure of
the Rydberg states with their very large electric dipole moments [145, 150]. In
addition, contributions from dipole-dipole interactions [59, 145, 151, 152] between
atoms and molecules during deceleration and trapping must be expected to become
increasingly signiﬁcant particularly on longer experimental timescales.
