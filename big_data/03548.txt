ABSTRACT

X-ray ﬂuorescent lines are unique features of the reﬂection spectrum of the torus when
irradiated by the central AGN. Their intrinsic line width can be used to probe the line-emitting
region. Previous studies have focused on the Fe Kα line at 6.4 keV, which is the most promi-
nent ﬂuorescent line. These studies, however, are limited by the spectral resolution of cur-
rently available instruments, the best of which is ∼ 1860 km s−1 aﬀorded by the Chandra
High-Energy Grating (HEG). The HEG spectral resolution is improved by a factor of 4 at
1.74 keV, where the Si Kα line is located. We measured the FWHM of the Si Kα line for
Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, which are 570 ± 240, 730 ± 320, and 320 ± 280 km s−1,
respectively. They are 3 − 5 times smaller than those measured with the Fe Kα line previ-
ously. It shows that the intrinsic widths of the Fe Kα line are most likely to be over-estimated.
The measured widths of the Si Kα line put the line-emitting region outside the dust sublima-
tion radius in these galaxies. It indicates that for Compton-thick AGN, the X-ray ﬂuorescence
material are likely to be the same as the dusty torus emitting in the infrared.

1 INTRODUCTION

The obscuring torus around active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a
cornerstone of the uniﬁcation scheme of AGN. In the traditional
model the inclination of the torus to the observer is supposed to
be responsible for the major diﬀerences between type I and type
II AGN (e.g. Antonucci 1993). The location of torus was ﬁrst con-
sidered to be on parsec scale, large enough to obscure the broad
line region (BLR) and small enough not to obscure the narrow line
region (Krolik & Begelman 1988). This is conﬁrmed by recent in-
frared interferometric observations of several nearby galaxies (see
Netzer 2015, for a recent review). The presence of the obscuring
torus is also revealed by the Compton reﬂection component in the
X-ray spectra of AGN, which is characterized by the ﬂuorescent Fe
Kα line (6.4 keV). The parsec-scale distance of the emitting region
of the Fe Kα line is evidenced by the stability of the Fe Kα line
(e.g. Bianchi 2012). The exact location of the emitting region can
be estimated based on the intrinsic width of the X-ray ﬂuorescent
lines (e.g. Shu et al. 2011, and reference therein).

The measurement of the intrinsic line width, however, is lim-
ited by the spectral resolution of currently available instruments.
The Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer
(HETGS, Canizares et al. 2005) provides a best spectral resolution

of 0.012 Å (full width half maximum, FWHM) with its High En-
ergy Grating (HEG), which at 6.4 keV corresponds to ∼ 1860 km
s−1, very close to the measured mean FWHM of the Fe line (2000
km s−1) by Shu et al. (2011). We note that the HEG spectral reso-
lution can be improved for lines at lower energies. Therefore, the
measurement of the line width can be improved by using the other
ﬂuorescent lines, such as the Si Kα line at 1.74 eV, where the HEG
spectral resolution is ∼ 500 km s−1, a factor of 4 times better than
that at 6.4 keV.

The non-Fe ﬂuorescent lines are generally weak, due to their
small yields. Nevertheless, they are still observable, especially for
Compton-thick AGN, the intrinsic continua of which are heavily
suppressed below 10 keV and the observed spectra are dominated
by the reﬂected component from the torus (e.g. Comastri 2004). For
example, a series of Kα ﬂuorescent lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, and
Mn are detected in M51, a low-luminosity Compton-thick AGN
(Xu et al. 2016).

In this Letter we compile a sample of Compton-thick AGN
observed with Chandra HETGS to measure their intrinsic width of
the Si Kα line and estimate the location of the emitting region of the
X-ray ﬂuorescent lines. The errors quoted are for 90% conﬁdence
level.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

One complexity of using the Si Kα line (1.74 keV) is that it
is blended with the Mg XII Lyβ line at 1.745 keV (the ﬂuorescent
wavelengths are from Bearden 1967, while the other wavelengths
are from NIST1). The peaks of these two lines can be resolved
by HEG, provided that the signal is good enough. We searched
the Chandra data archive for Compton-thick AGN observed with
HETGS and found that the data of the Circinus galaxy, Mrk 3,
and NGC 1068 can be used to measure the two lines simultane-
ously. The exposure times are 600, 400, and 400 ks, respectively.
We use the data downloaded from Chandra Transmission Grating
Data Archive and Catalog (TGCat, Huenemoerder et al. 2011). All
the spectra are extracted from a region with a 2 arcsec half-width in
the cross-dispersion direction. The data from ±1 order of HEG are
combined together. The HEG spectra of all the three sources have
been published in the literature, such as Sambruna et al. (2001)
and Ar´evalo et al. (2014) for Circinus galaxy, Sako et al. (2000) for
Mrk 3, and Ogle et al. (2003) and Kallman et al. (2014) for NGC
1068.

3 RESULTS

The line complexes around 1.74 keV of Circinus, Mrk 3, and
NGC 1068 observed with Chandra HEG are plotted in Fig. 1. The
data are binned to 0.005 Å with a minimum signal-to-noise ratio
of 3.3. As can be seen, the line complexes are dominated by the Si
Kα line at 1.74 keV, but skewed toward higher energy where the
Mg XII Lyβ line is located. The peaks of the two lines are resolved
for Circinus and NGC 1068, while they are blended for Mrk 3. To
check the degrading of the spectral resolution due to the spatial ex-
tent of the Si Kα line, we extracted the radial proﬁle of the 1.74 keV
line complex (with a width of 20 eV) from the zero-order images
of the three sources, and found that it is consistent with the instru-
ment PSF proﬁle for all three sources. Therefor, the HEG resolving
power is not aﬀected much by the spatial extent of the Si Kα line.
We ﬁt the line complex with two Gaussian lines plus a power-
law continuum. The shift and width of the Mg XII Lyβ line are ﬁxed
with the values measured from the Mg XII Lyα line at 1.472 keV.
Since the Mg XII Lyα and Lyβ lines are from the same ions, their
line properties should be the same. The ﬁtting region is between
1.5 and 2.3 keV by neglecting the other main emission features.
The ﬁtted results are plotted in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 1.

From Fig. 1 we see that the line complexes around 1.74 keV
are reasonably ﬁtted by the adopted model. The residuals around
1.73 keV are likely due to the Al XIII Lyα line, while those above

1.75 keV are likely due to the ﬂuorescent lines from singly ion-
ized Si+ (1.753 keV, Bearden 1967), the ﬂuxes of which are much
smaller compared with those from neutral Si. The ﬁtted line widths
of the Si Kα line are 1.4 ± 0.6, 1.8 ± 0.8, and 0.8 ± 0.7 eV, for
Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, respectively. They correspond to
FWHM velocities (vFWHM) of 570 ± 240, 730 ± 320, and 320 ± 280
km s−1. Assuming the line-emitting material is in a virialized orbit

around the black hole, its distance to the black hole can be esti-
mated as (Netzer 1990) r = 4c2/3v2
FWHMrg, where rg = GMBH /c2.
Adopting the black hole masses listed in Table 1, the distances of
the line-emitting region are 0.03 pc, 4.9 pc, and 0.5 pc, for Circi-
nus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, respectively. We note that the numer-
ical factor 4/3 in the above formula suﬀers from the uncertainty
of the geometrical and dynamical assumptions of the line-emitting
material. For example, if it is in a shape of thick disk with h/r < 1,
the factor becomes 4(h2/r2 + sin2 i), where i is the inclination to the
line of sight (Netzer 2013). On the other hand, if the line-emitting
material is in some kind of outﬂow, the factor will depend on the
dynamical modelling of the ﬂow.

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

X-ray ﬂuorescent lines are unique features of the reﬂection
spectrum emitted by the torus when irradiated by the central AGN.
They are most prominent for Compton-thick sources, the intrinsic
spectra of which are hidden from direct viewing. The intrinsic line
width of the X-ray ﬂuorescent lines can be used to probe the loca-
tion of the line-emitting region. Using the Si Kα line at 1.74 keV,
for which the Chandra HEG has a spectral resolution ∼ 4 times
better than for the Fe Kα line at 6.4 keV, we measured the FWHM
of the Si Kα line for Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068. They have
a FWHM of 570, 730, 320 km s−1, respectively. These values are
3 − 5 times smaller than those measured with the Fe Kα line, which
are 1710, 3140, and 2660 km s−1, respectively (Shu et al. 2011).

While the ionization potentials of the valence electrons of neu-
tral Si and Fe are similar, the ionization potential of the K-shell
electrons of Fe is larger than that of Si. Since the hard photons can
penetrate deeper into the material, in principle, the emitting region
of the Fe Kα line should not be smaller than that of the Si Kα line.
Therefore the intrinsic line widths of the Fe Kα line should not be
larger than those of the Si Kα line, and they are most likely to be
over-estimated. While the limited spectral resolution is likely to be
a major reason for the over-estimation, there are several other rea-
sons that could lead to a large measured width of the Fe Kα line.

First, the neutral Fe Kα line is composed of a doublet, Kα1 at
6.404 keV, and Kα2 at 6.391 keV, with a ﬂux ratio of 2:1 (Bearden
1967). This leads to a diﬀerence of 13 eV (610 km s−1), which
is comparable to the FWHM of HEG at 6.4 keV. Secondly, the
observed Fe Kα line may not come only from the neutral Fe,
and is likely blended with those from other low-ionized Fe ions,
the energies of which are higher than 6.4 keV by tens of eV
(Kaastra &Mewe 1993). Thirdly, the Compton scattering of the Fe
Kα photons also tends to enlarge the width of the Fe Kα line. These
intrinsic spreading makes the measurement of the intrinsic line
width of the Fe Kα line diﬃcult even with instruments of higher
spectral resolution. Therefore one should be cautious when using
the measured width of the Fe Kα line to infer the line-emitting re-
gion.

The Si Kα line is also composed of a doublet (at 1.7400 keV
and 1.7394 keV) with a diﬀerence of 0.6 eV (100 km s−1), which
is well below the HEG spectral resolution. As the Si Kα line is
well resolved from the singly ionized Si+ Kα line (1.753 keV),
it represents the truly cold torus, diﬀerent from the Fe Kα line,
which may be contaminated by ionized Fe ions. It is interesting to
compare the estimated distances of the line-emitting region with
the dust sublimation radius rdust. Using the scaling relation ob-
tained from the reverberation measurements of the inner dust ra-
dius by Koshida et al. (2014), the rdust are 0.02, 0.15, and 0.11

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

pc for Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, respectively. Therefore,
the estimated line-emitting regions are located outside the rdust.
This is in contrast to the recent claims that the line-emitting re-
gions are within the rdust based on the measured width of the Fe
Kα line (e.g. Minezaki & Matsushita 2015; Gandhi et al. 2015).
The line-emitting distances estimated from the width of Si Kα line
are also consistent with the recent infrared interferometric obser-
vation of Circinus on sub-parsec scale (Tristram et al. 2014) and
NGC 1068 on parsec scale (L´opez-Gonzaga et al. 2014). It shows
that for Compton-thick AGN, the X-ray ﬂuorescence material are
likely to be the same as the dusty torus emitting in the infrared.

The samples we studied only include 3 galaxies. There are
other several galaxies, for which the Si Kα lines are detected sig-
niﬁcantly, although the existing data are not deep enough to al-
low a deblending of the Mg XII Lyβ line yet, such as NGC 4507
and NGC 7582. With further observations of moderate exposure
times (200 − 300 ks), the kind of studies conducted here can also
be applied to these samples. Beside the Si Kα line, the ﬂuorescent
Kα lines of S, Ar, and Ca are also detected for all three sources, but
with a lower S/N due to the quick decline of the eﬀective area of
HEG above 2 keV. The signals are generally too weak to provide
useful constraints on the line width. Nevertheless, the eﬀective area
around these lines will be improved with the forthcoming soft X-
ray calorimeter on-board Astro-H, which has a spectral resolution
∼ 7 eV.

Because the Si Kα line is more sensitive to the absorption than
the Fe Kα line, the ﬂux ratio between the Fe Kα line and Si Kα line
will be a useful probe of the torus. For example, if the torus is
clumpy, the Si Kα line will not be signiﬁcantly reduced, due to its
pass through the free-of-obscuration regions between the clumps
(e.g. Nandra & Geoge 1994; Liu & Li 2014). Unlike the measure-
ment of the line widths presented here, which needs deep data to
resolve the Mg XII Lyβ line, the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio can be calcu-
lated for a larger sample with less S/N. We have compared the Fe
Kα/Si Kα ratio of 10 type II AGN with the simulation of clumpy
torus (Liu & Li 2014), and found that the clumpy torus is preferred.
The detailed results are presented in Liu et al. (2016). These results
show that non-Fe ﬂuorescent lines at soft X-ray band are a potential
powerful probe of the torus around AGN.
