ABSTRACT

The supernova remnant (SNR) G338.3−0.0 spatially correlates with HESS J1640−465, which is considered the most luminous γ-ray
source associated with a SNR in our Galaxy. The X-ray pulsar PSR J1640−4631 has been recently discovered within the SNR shell,
which could favor a leptonic origin for the detected very-high-energy (VHE) emission. In spite of this, the origin of the VHE radiation
from HESS J1640−465 has not been unambiguously clariﬁed so far. Indeed, a hadronic explanation cannot be ruled out by current
observations. On the basis of atomic (HI) and molecular (12CO) archival data, we determine, for the ﬁrst time, the total ambient density
of protons in the region of the G338.3−0.0/HESS J1640−465 system, a critical parameter for understanding the emission mechanisms
at very high energies. The value obtained is in the 100− 130 cm−3 range. Besides this, we developed a new hadronic model to describe
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the HESS J1640−465 source, which includes the latest total γ-ray cross-section for proton-
proton collisions available in the literature. By using the assessed ambient proton density, we found that the total energy in accelerated
−0.7 × 1050 erg for a source distance of 8.5 and 13 kpc, respectively. The
protons required to ﬁt the data is 5.4+4.7
case where the source distance is 8.5 kpc agrees with the typical scenario in which the energy released is on the order of 1051 erg and
∼ 10% of that energy is transferred to the accelerated protons, whereas the case corresponding to a source distance of 13 kpc requires
either a higher value of the energy released in the explosion or a larger energy fraction to accelerate protons.

1. Introduction
HESS J1640−465 is considered the most luminous very-high-
energy (VHE) γ-ray source associated with a Galactic super-
nova remnant (SNR). Since its discovery, it has been linked to
the SNR G338.3−0.0 because in the plane of the sky they ap-
pear spatially coincident (Aharonian et al. 2005). At TeV en-
ergies HESS J1640−465 has been reported to be marginally
extended with a Gaussian radius of 4′.3 (Abramowski et al.
2014b), although the last statistical update on this source shows
a more extended emission with a size of ∼12′ (see Fig. 1 in
Abramowski et al. 2014a).
At radio wavelengths the remnant G338.3−0.0 shows two
bright arcs comprising an incomplete shell of ∼8′ in size, whose
northern part is seen projected at the edge of a confusing area
with several HII regions (Castelletti et al. 2011). Recently, on
the basis of NuSTAR observations the previously known X-
ray source XMMU J164045.4−463131 inside the radio shell of
G338.3−0.0, was conﬁrmed as a pulsar named PSR J1640−4631
(Gotthelf et al. 2014 and references therein).
Roughly a decade after the discovery of HESS J1640−465
(Aharonian et al. 2005), its origin is still an open question. More-
over, although the study of the medium in which G338.3−0.0
evolves is crucial for understanding the origin of the VHE ra-
diation, it has never been investigated in detail, and in particu-
lar, there is no observational determination of the ambient den-
sity reported to date. In this work we analyze the environment
of the SNR G338.3−0.0 through a multiwavelength approach,
and we use the observational data to establish, for the ﬁrst time,
constraints on the ambient proton density. Additionally, we in-

vestigate the plausibility of a hadronic mechanism for the γ-ray
emission by modeling the GeV-TeV spectrum with the latest es-
timations available in the literature of the cross section for γ-ray
production through proton-proton interactions.

2. The data
We analyzed the surroundings of G338.3−0.0 by using obser-
vations of both the atomic and the molecular gas. The neutral
hydrogen (HI) data were extracted from the Southern Galac-
tic Plane Survey (SGPS I, McClure-Griﬃths et al. 2005), which
combines low- and high-resolution data from observations in the
HI 21-cm line carried out with the 64-m single-dish Parkes tele-
scope and the interferometer ATCA. The SGPS dataset has an
angular resolution of 2′.2 and a separation between consecutive
velocity channels of 0.82 km s−1. Radial velocities for this sur-
vey, as well as the ones used throughout this work, are measured
with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). The rms sensitiv-
ity of the HI survey is ∼1.6 K. On the other hand, the molecular
gas distribution was traced by using the emission corresponding
to the J = 1 − 0 rotational transition at 115 GHz of the 12CO.
These data were acquired with the 1.2-m telescope at the Cerro
Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, and they provide an
angular resolution and a velocity channel separation of 0◦.125
and 1.30 km s−1, respectively, with an rms noise per velocity
channel of ∼0.12 K (Dame et al. 2001).
To trace the detailed radio continuum emission of
G338.3−0.0 and its surroundings we used the image at 610 MHz
presented in Castelletti et al. (2011). It was obtained from obser-
vations carried out with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope

(GMRT) and has a synthesized beam of 12′′.6 × 5′′.0 and an
rms noise level of 1.6 mJy beam−1.
An image of the region around G338.3−0.0 emitting at
870 µm was extracted from the APEX Telescope Large
Area Survey of
the Galaxy (ATLASGAL), carried out
with the LABOCA bolometer array at the APEX telescope
(Schuller et al. 2009). The angular resolution of the ATLAS-
GAL image is ∼19′′.2, and the typical rms noise is ∼50−70 mJy
beam−1.
Additionally to the spectral line and continuum radio obser-
vations, three representative wavelengths were selected to reveal
the far-infrared (far-IR) emission at 24, 160, and 250 µm. The
map at the lowest wavelength was obtained from the 24 and 70
Micron Survey of the Inner Galactic Disk with MIPS (MIPS-
GAL, Carey et al. 2009), carried out with the MIPS camera of
Spitzer. The data at 160 and 250 µm acquired with the PACS
(Poglitsch et al. 2010) and SPIRE (Griﬃn et al. 2010) instru-
ments aboard Herschel1, respectively, were retrieved from the
HerschelScienceArchive(HSA).

SNRG338.3−0.0

Much of the discussion in the following depends on the ra-
dio continuum and γ-ray emission extents in the ﬁeld toward
G338.3−0.0. Therefore, before presenting our analysis of the
medium in the vicinity of this remnant, we display in Fig. 1 the
GMRT high-resolution image at 610 MHz obtained in direction
to G338.3−0.0 overlaid with a few representative contours from
the updated H.E.S.S. image of HESS J1640−465 presented in
Abramowski et al. (2014a). The bright region that appears to be
in contact with the northern side of the SNR shell corresponds
to the complex of thermal HII regions (Urquhart et al. 2012,
Brown et al. 2014), whose names are also labeled in Fig. 1 for
reference.

A parameter of particular interest for determining the char-
acteristics of the environment in which a SNR evolves is its dis-
tance. On the basis of HI 21-cm absorption and emission spec-
tra, Lemiere et al. (2009) put G338.3−0.0 at distances between
8.5 and 13 kpc, the same range that we adopt in our calculations.
Although the connection between G338.3−0.0 and the group of
the northern HII regions has not been unambiguously proved,
the general consistency of the SNR HI absorption spectrum with
that obtained toward the ionized gas seems to support that they
are physically related (Lemiere et al. 2009). This may convey the
idea that G338.3−0.0 is evolving in an inhomogeneous density
environment. Based on HI absorption proﬁles, Urquhart et al.
(2012) established a distance of ∼ 13 kpc for the HII regions
G338.39+0.16, G338.4+00.0, and G338.45+0.06 in the complex
(see Fig. 1).

We study the ISM in the region of G338.3−0.0 based on
observations of the HI and 12CO line intensities. Figure 2 pro-
vides an overview of the atomic hydrogen emission integrated
in the velocity intervals that correspond to the lower and upper
kinematical distance limits to the SNR. Each image is the re-
sult of an integration in 16 consecutive spectral channels, span-
ning 13 km s−1 around the central velocity corresponding to dis-
tance values of 8.5 and 13 kpc (assuming the rotation curve for

data is 0.◦085 (68% containment region). The white cross indicates the

our Galaxy of Fich et al. 1989, with R0 = 8.5 kpc and Θ0 =
220 km s−1). One can see that the HI gas depicts an inhomoge-
neous distribution, with remarkable minima exactly overlapping
both the shell of G338.3−0.0 and the ionized gas extending to the
north. The remaining velocity images in the HI data cube show
no features that may be clearly associated with G338.3−0.0.
Even though the lack of suﬃcient angular resolution of the
12CO data prevents us from clearly distinguishing small-scale
spatial correspondences between the shock front of G338.3−0.0
and the molecular content in the region, we can still search for
some kinematical evidence by analyzing the spectral properties
of the interstellar gas. We thus construct combined spectra of
the 12CO emission and HI absorption in the direction of the
radio-bright east and west limbs of the SNR. Both spectra are
presented in Fig. 3. The absorption proﬁles of the atomic gas,
drawn by a red line in Fig. 3, were obtained after subtracting
an average background spectrum to the emission one. Several
molecular components, represented by the blue line in both pan-
els of Fig. 3, are also apparent in the velocity distribution of the
12CO. Using the Fich et al. (1989) rotation curve, we found that
the components at the highest negative velocities from ∼−125
to ∼−107 km s−1 (peak centered at ∼−116 km s−1) and those
in the velocity range between ∼−40 and ∼−23 km s−1 (peak
centered at ∼−31 km s−1), respectively, include the lower and
upper limits set on the SNR distance. In fact, owing to the kine-
matic distance ambiguity (KDA) in the fourth quadrant of the
Galaxy, the peak centered at ∼−116 km s−1 corresponds to a dis-
tance of either 6.5 kpc or 9.3 kpc, whereas near and far distances

of 2.6 and 13.2 kpc are deduced for the latter one centered at
∼−31 km s−1. To resolve the distance ambiguity, we note that in
both spectra obtained toward the east and west rims, the 12CO
emission centered at ∼−116 km s−1 is associated with an ab-
sorption line in the HI 21-cm spectra up to the velocity of the
tangent point. The 12CO emission seen around this velocity may,
therefore, be the result of molecular material located beyond the
tangent point, which is approximately ∼8 kpc. In this case, the
corresponding HI absorption feature could be attributed to the
atomic gas embedded within the 12CO, which absorbs the contin-
uum from G338.3−0.0. In addition, spectral asymmetries toward
red- and blueshifted velocities are evident at the highest nega-
tive velocity range for each SNR boundary. Numerous factors
can contribute to the observed broadening, among them pertur-
bations in the velocity ﬁeld of the molecular material caused by
the interaction with the SNR shock front, thus providing an ar-
gument for the connection between the molecular emission and
G338.3−0.0. On the other hand, for both rims in G338.3−0.0,
we consider the spectral match between the molecular emission
line at ∼−31 km s−1 and possible absorption HI features some-
what speculative, and therefore it is diﬃcult to reach any con-
clusion on the location of this molecular material. However, as
discussed below, the spatial correlation between the radio and
the submillimeter continuum emission, and the sites emitting in
the IR band, supports the hypothesis that these spectral features
most probably reveal interstellar material in the surroundings of
the SNR.

Supplementary evidence of the inhomogeneous medium that
surrounds G338.3−0.0 can be obtained from submillimeter and
far-IR continuum emission across the ﬁeld. Figure 4a shows
the 870 µm continuum emission as observed by APEX. In the
middle part of the western radio-bright shell of G338.3−0.0, as
seen in projection, there is a conspicuous bright clump (R.A.
= 16h40m34s.57, Dec. = −46◦31′15′′.9, J2000.0) embedded in
a diﬀuse emission region extending (∼2′) to the south. The an-
gular extent of the clump, cataloged as the ATLASGAL source
AGAL338.307+00.006 (CSC2 Contreras et al. 2013), is about
80′′. Panels b, c, and d in Fig. 4, respectively, display the far-IR
emission at 24 µm from Spitzer, and in the two Herschel bands

of 160 and 250 µm. These images show that most of the long-
wavelength IR emission is inside the intensity green contour that
delineates the supernova shock front. Among the most remark-
able IR features are the bubble G338.364+00.020 lying in the
north side of the remnant (Anderson et al. 2014) and the bright
knot located in the western rim, likely the IR counterpart of the
identiﬁed submillimeter clump. Additionally, a trail of diﬀuse IR
emission is seen matching the western limb of G338.3−0.0. On
the whole, the inhomogeneities observed from the atomic and
molecular gas are thus supported by the morphological proper-
ties observed in the far-IR emission, which could arise from the
interstellar dust embedded in the molecular material shocked and
heated by the passage of the SNR shock front. Besides this, it is
probably that the clump emitting at 870 µm corresponds to dense
material within the molecular gas.

3.2. TheprotoncontentintheSNRsurroundings

In Fig. 5 we present the distribution of the column density of
the molecular and atomic protons in the region of G338.3−0.0
for the velocity width ∆v = 13 km s−1 overlapping the velocities
corresponding to the lower and upper kinematical distance deter-
minations to G338.3−0.0. The superposed contours of the radio
continuum emission at 610 MHz are plotted for reference. A gra-
dient in the column density, hence in the distribution of the ISM,
from the southeastern half of the ﬁeld to the northwestern region
dominates the picture. For each interval of radial velocities ∆ν
considered in this work (see Fig. 2), the hydrogen column den-
sity NHI was determined using the relation (Dickey & Lockman

density of the molecular hydrogen NH2. It was inferred from
the 12CO dataset, through the integrated 12CO emission W12CO,
using the 12CO-to-H2 conversion factor XCO = NH2 /W12CO =
2.0 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1 reported by Bertsch et al. (1993).
The total proton column density is therefore obtained taking both
the atomic and molecular contributions into account: Np = NHI +
2NH2. For the highest velocity range, the integration from −121
to −111 km s−1 yields a total column density Np ∼ 6.6 × 1021
cm−2, while for the interval between −40 and −25 km s−1, the
column is Np ∼ 8.7 × 1021 cm−2. In both cases the main contri-
bution to Np is given by the molecular hydrogen. We then use the
derived column density to roughly calculate the average proton
density ¯np = Np/L for the TeV region, where we assume that the
thickness L along the line of sight equals the size of the minor
axis of the integration region (L ∼ 36 pc and L ∼ 55 pc at dis-
tances of 8.5 and 13 kpc, respectively). The total proton density
estimated in this way varies between 100 and 130 cm−3 for the
upper and lower distance limits, respectively, with uncertainties
of about 30%. The associated total proton masses are approxi-
mately 2 × 105 and 4 × 104 M⊙
Additionally, we infer the mass and density of the gas in the
bright clump identiﬁed at submillimeter wavelengths, using the
relation given by Abreu-Vicente et al. (2015) for ATLASGAL
sources

for each density value.

where ν represents a frequency of 345 GHz (corresponding to
870 µm) at which an integrated ﬂux density S ν is measured
over the source, d is the distance to the clump, and Bν(Td) is
the Planck distribution function at the dust temperature Td, as-
sumed to be ∼20 K (Schuller et al. 2009). Here, R is the gas-
to-dust ratio, and κν is the dust absorption coeﬃcient. If we
adopt canonical values of 100 and 1.85 cm2 g−1 for R and
κν (Schuller et al. 2009) and use the ﬂux density measurement
for AGAL338.307+00.006 reported in the CSC catalog S ν =
(8.48 ± 1.55) Jy (which corresponds to a region with an eﬀective
radius of about 40′′), we obtain a total mass of ∼4.2 × 103M⊙
.
In this calculation we assume an average distance of ∼10 kpc to
the clump. The hydrogen particle density of the clump can be
calculated through the relation (Rosolowsky et al. 2010)

where r is the radius of the ATLASGAL source, while µH = 2.8
and mH are the mean particle mass and the hydrogen atom mass,
respectively. The resulting density is ∼2.5 × 103 cm−3. Both the
mass and density obtained here for AGAL338.307+00.006 are
comparable to those found in other ATLASGAL sources with
similar characteristics to the clump analyzed here (Schuller et al.
2009).

To put the calculations presented in this work in context, we ﬁrst
brieﬂy review the models that over the past eight years have been
proposed to account for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the G338.3−0.0/HESS J1640−465 system. At the beginning, the
detection of the source XMMU J164045.4−463131 (Funk et al.
2007), which was by then a promising pulsar candidate inside the

radio extent of G338.3−0.0, made the pure leptonic processes the
most natural way to explain the observed TeV γ rays. Indeed, a
variety of leptonic models have been elaborated, in which the γ-
ray photons are primarily created via inverse Compton (IC) inter-
actions of energetic electrons injected by the compact source that
scatter with ambient photons (Lemiere et al. 2009; Slane et al.
2010).

Later on to model the ﬂux measurements from radio to the
γ-ray band, Abramowski et al. (2014b) included the contribution
to the TeV photons resulting from interactions of electrons accel-
erated at the SNR shock front with their surroundings. However,
as noted by the authors themselves, their approach with ﬁxed
IC contribution from the dust content and electron/proton ratio
fails in providing a good ﬁt to the γ-ray spectral shape. A pos-
sible contribution by electron bremsstrahlung emission was also
considered by Abramowski et al. (2014b) to explain the origin
of HESS J1640−465, but they found that a high target density of
500 cm−3 and high electron/proton ratios of about 0.1 are needed
to match the TeV ﬂuxes of the source.

On the basis of

the physical parameters derived for
the recently discovered pulsar PSR J1640−4631 within the
SNR G338.3−0.0, Gotthelf et al. (2014) revised an evolution-
ary model for the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in which the
broad-band spectrum for HESS J1640−465 is ﬁt with a sin-
gle power-law function. With a pulsar distance assumed to be
12 kpc, Gotthelf et al. (2014) ﬁnd a ﬁtted low ambient den-
sity of 0.03 cm−3. It is interesting to point out that in all the
aforementioned leptonic models, the radio band is poorly sam-
pled. Indeed, except in the Abramowski et al. (2014b) work, in
which the radio ﬂux estimates at 235, 610, 1280, and 2300 MHz
(Castelletti et al. 2011) were arbitrarily scaled (by a factor of
0.5), in the remaining works only the ﬂux upper limit deter-
mined at 610 MHz (Giacani et al. 2008) or the ﬂux at 843 MHz
(Whiteoak & Green 1996) were considered to anchor the spec-
trum of HESS J1640−465 at the lower energy end.
Diﬀerent hadronic interaction models were also applied to
account for the spectral distribution of HESS J1640−465. For
the hadronic emission, the observed γ rays would be generated
in the decay of neutral pions created after the collisions of pro-
tons accelerated at the SNR shock with dense interstellar mate-
rial. However, in all the works that analyze this alternative sce-
nario, no observational constraints on the surrounding medium
density were used, but this relevant magnitude was either de-
rived from the ﬁtted γ-ray spectrum or constrained during the
modeling. For instance, low ambient densities of ∼1 cm−3, for
distances less than 8 kpc, and the SN total energy required to
accelerate hadrons as large as ∼ 7.6 × 1050 erg were deduced
in the model proposed by Funk et al. (2007). On the other hand,
Slane et al. (2010) ﬁnd that hadronic modeling is possible with
an assumed shock compression ratio of 4 and a high total SN
energy transferred to accelerated protons of 25 %, which ﬁx the
ISM density at ∼100 cm−3.
Similar values for the ambient density were deduced by
Abramowski et al. (2014b). However, they determined that the
product of total proton energy and mean target density could be
as high as Wp ¯nH ∼ 4 × 1052 erg cm−3, assuming a distance of
10 kpc to G338.3−0.0. A more recent estimation of the high-
energy part of the HESS J1640−465 SED has been reported
in Lemoine-Goumard et al. (2014), using the latest Fermi-LAT
data. In that work a harder SED compared with earlier studies
was obtained. These authors also developed a hadronic model to
explain both the high- and very-high-energy part of the SED by
using the new Fermi-LAT ﬂuxes. Based on the previous consid-
erations from Abramowski et al. (2014b), they used an ambient

proton density of 150 cm−3 and concluded that a hadronic sce-
nario is a viable option. However, they found diﬃculties in dis-
carding a component originated in the PWN, which could relax
the constrain of high values of energy in accelerated protons that
require the hadronic scenario in some regions of the parameter
space.

In the following, we show that the GeV-TeV γ-ray spectrum
of HESS J1640−465, which incorporates the latest data collected
with the Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. instruments, can be explained
on the basis of the pure hadronic model developed in the current
work. Our new analysis uses target proton densities measured
in the region of the γ-ray source to conciliate the diﬃculties of
earlier models by bringing together reasonable values for the SN
explosion energy and the eﬃciency of converting this energy into
shock accelerated protons.

4.2. Animprovedhadronicmodel

As already discussed in Sec. 4.1, a hadronic origin of the
γ-ray emission from HESS J1640−465 has been previously
proposed in the literature. In this section we present a new
model to account for the production of γ rays in the HESS
source via hadronic interactions. As an important particular-
ity, our emission model uses the parametrization of the γ-ray
diﬀerential cross section in the proton-proton collisions given
in Kafexhiu et al. (2014), which is more detailed and com-
prehensive than previously published ones (Kelner et al. 2006;
Kamae et al. 2006). Consequently, the diﬀerential cross-section,
especially in the low proton energy part, together with the ﬁt
of the spectral index and the cutoﬀ energy (which are ﬁxed a
priori in previous models) are now described much better. In
modeling the spectra, we consider the latest statistics data from
Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. of HESS J1640−465. The total energy
going into accelerated protons required for ﬁtting all the col-
lected data points, which is an essential physical parameter to
test the feasibility of the model, is assessed by using the proton
density in the region of the γ-ray emission obtained in Sec. 3.1,
¯np ≃ 100 − 130 cm−3. It is worth mentioning that the relevance
of this magnitude in our model was the main motivation of a re-
liable determination of the ambient protons density in the region
of the source.

We ﬁt the γ-ray data points by assuming a proton distribution
in momentum given by a power law with an exponential cutoﬀ

where C is a normalization constant; p the momentum of the ac-
celerated protons, which is related to the proton energy by Ep =

pc4 (c is the speed of light and mp the proton mass), Γ
is the spectral index, and pcut represents the cutoﬀ momentum.
The cutoﬀ proton energy is given by Ecut = √c2 p2

From Fig. 6 it can be seen that the γ-ray spectral shape is
quite well ﬁtted by our model, with a χ2 = 38.1 for 28 d.o.f. As
mentioned above, it is mandatory to calculate the total energy in
accelerated protons required by the model to ﬁt the data points,
in order to test the feasibility of it. The total energy in accelerated
protons is given by

where it is assumed that Emin = 1.218 GeV, which is the thresh-
old energy for pion production (Kafexhiu et al. 2014). In this
way the minimum energy in accelerated protons is calculated,
i.e., accelerated protons with lower energies could exist but they
cannot produce pions when interacting with ambient protons,
and then they do not contribute to the γ-ray spectrum.

For the case in which HESS J1640−465 is placed at the
lower distance limit of 8.5 kpc, the value determined for the
SNR G338.3−0.0, the total energy in accelerated protons is cal-
culated by using Eq. (7) taking into account the uncertainty
on the ambient proton density and on the ﬂux at 1σ level (see
shaded region in Fig. 6)

−2.3(cid:17) × 1049 erg (d = 8.5 kpc),

Ep = (cid:16)5.4+4.7
in this expression the central value is obtained by using the best
ﬁt to the γ-ray spectral data points and a proton density ¯np = 130
cm−3. On the other hand, for the upper limit of 13 kpc, we obtain
the following energy range

(8)

−0.7(cid:17) × 1050 erg (d = 13 kpc),

Ep = (cid:16)1.6+1.4
where the central value is obtained by using the best ﬁt to the
γ-ray spectrum and a density ¯np = 100 cm−3.

(9)

The typical energy released in a SN explosion is assumed to
be on the order of 1051 erg, and the canonical fraction of energy
transferred to the accelerated particles is 10%. In the case where
the source is placed at d = 8.5 kpc, the total energy in accelerated
protons is . 1050 erg, which is consistent with the typical sce-
nario. However, when the source is placed at d = 13 kpc, the to-
tal energy in accelerated protons can be as high as ∼ 3×1050 erg,
which is three times greater than the typical value. We note that
Ep ∼ 1050 erg is the lower end of the interval. In any case, higher
values for the total energy in accelerated protons could be due to
either more energy being released in the supernova explosion or
a larger amount of energy transferred to this component. Another
possibility is the existence of an additional contribution to the γ-
ray spectrum because of the PWN in G338.3−0.0 as suggested
by Lemoine-Goumard et al. (2014).
As mentioned in Sec. 3.2, the source AGAL338.307+00.006
can be a prominent region of γ-ray emission due to its high value
of proton density compared with the average one. The fraction
of the total γ-ray ﬂux coming from this region can be estimated
through

and volume of the entire γ-ray source, respectively. The frac-
tion of the ﬂux for a distance d = 8.5 kpc is fclump (cid:27) 1.6%,

where V is the volume of the source, Pp(x) the spatial distribu-
tion function of the accelerated protons, and np the total ambi-

celerated protons are uniformly distributed in the source volume
Pp(x) = 1/V, so ¯np is the average of the proton density in the
source volume. We assume that for all subsequent calculations.
The energy spectrum of γ rays originated in proton-proton
interactions has been extensively studied in the literature. Re-
cently, a detailed study has been performed by Kafexhiu et al.
(2014). In that work, a parametrization of the γ-ray energy
spectrum has been obtained for proton energies ranging from
the proton-proton kinematic threshold to 1 PeV. The diﬀer-
ential cross section at
low proton energies (. 3 GeV) is
obtained from a compilation of experimental data, while at
high proton energies it is derived from Monte Carlo simula-
tions. The hadronic interactions at the highest energies are not
known. In particular, it is not possible yet to predict the re-
sults of these interactions from ﬁrst principles quantum chro-
modynamics (see for instance, Werner 1993). Nevertheless,
there are models that make use of low energy accelerator
data to extrapolate the hadronic interactions to higher energies
(d’Enterria et al. 2011). The parametrization in Kafexhiu et al.
(2014) has been performed for the hadronic interaction models
implemented in Geant 4.10.0 (Agostinelli et al. 2003), PYTHIA
8.18 (Sjöstrand et al. 2008), Sibyll 2.1 (Fletcher et al. 1994),
and QGSJET01 (Kalmykov et al. 1997). In this paper, we use
the PYTHIA 8.18 option for the high-energy part. It is worth
mentioning that one of the most important aspects of the new
parametrization is the detailed description of the γ-ray spectrum
at low proton energies, which represents an important improve-
ment over older approaches.

In Fig. 6 we show the SED of HESS J1640−465 for high-
and very-high energies. The data points of the high-energy part
of the SED correspond to observations carried out by Fermi-LAT
(Lemoine-Goumard et al. 2014), whereas the measurements are
from H.E.S.S. in the VHE region (Abramowski et al. 2014b). We
performed a χ2-ﬁtting to all the γ-ray points. The solid line in-
cluded in Fig. 6 denotes our ﬁt, obtained by using the Eqs. (4)
and (5) presented here and leaving C, Γ, and Ecut as free param-
eters. Our ﬁt provides a spectral index Γ = 2.13 ± 0.02 and a
cutoﬀ energy log(Ecut/GeV)= 4.73 ± 0.09.

which was obtained using that ¯nclump
= 3 × 103 cm−3 (cal-
culated from Eq. (3)) and ¯np = 130 cm−3. The correspond-
ing value of this fraction for d = 13 kpc is fclump (cid:27) 1.2%,
computed with ¯nclump
= 1.8 × 103 cm−3 (also from Eq. (3))
and ¯np = 100 cm−3. The volume of both regions depends on
the source distance. The cataloged angular size is used to cal-
culate the volume of AGAL338.307+00.006. For the source
HESS J1640−465, we use the volume corresponding to the cal-
culation of the average density (see Sec. 3.2). In any case, it
seems that the AGAL338.307+00.006 region makes a subdomi-
nant contribution to the total γ-ray emission of the source.

5. Summary

In this paper, based on a multiwavelength approach, we have an-
alyzed the morphological and spectral properties of the ISM in
the vicinity of the SNR G338.3−0.0. Taking the spatial match
between the γ-ray source HESS J1640−465 and the entire shell
of the remnant into account, we revisited the likelihood of a
hadronic nature for the TeV photons. For this purpose, we an-
alyzed the HI, 12CO, sub-mm continuum, and far-IR available
information and showed that this remnant evolves in a highly in-
homogeneous ambient with strong gradients in the distribution
of the atomic and molecular gas. We have also found possible
observational signatures of a physical relationship between the
SNR and the 12CO material. Additionally, for the ﬁrst time, we
used the atomic and molecular observational lines to determine
the averaged ISM proton density in the 100 − 130 cm−3 range
over the whole extension of HESS J1640−465 (and hence the
SNR shell).
Our ﬁndings, obtained directly from observational data in the
region of the SNR G338.3−0.0/HESS J1640−465 system rather
than from the ﬁtting models as occurred in all the previous stud-
ies provide support to show that the γ-ray emissivity can be suit-
ably modeled by a purely hadronic scenario. Moreover, the as-
sessed target proton density allowed us to study the feasibility
of our model by comparing the energy in accelerated protons,
required to ﬁt the γ-ray HESS J1640−465 spectrum, with the
typical scenario in which the energy released by the SN explo-
sion is on the order of 1051 erg, and approximately 10 % of the
shock kinetic energy goes to the relativistic particles. For the
case where the system is at a distance of 8.5 kpc, the energy in
accelerated protons is consistent with the typical scenario, but
when the source is at a distance of 13 kpc, the energy in acceler-
ated protons can be larger (up to a factor of three). The latter case
can be explained by the higher energy released during the SN
explosion or even by a larger energy fraction transferred to the
accelerated protons. In either case, a contribution from the PWN
associated with the pulsar PSR J1640−4631 cannot be discarded
by the present data. The next generation of Cherenkov telescopes
like the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA, Actis et al. 2011) will
have a much better angular resolution, which will be very useful
for identifying the regions where most of γ rays originate. This
is of crucial importance for studying the relative contributions of
the PWN and the G338.3−0.0 and surroundings regions.
the average proton density
estimated in our work should not have a strong impact on
the hadronic models found in the literature (like the one in
Abramowski et al. 2014b) because the proton density required
or assumed in most of these models is ∼ 150 cm−3, a value
contained in the interval of densities obtained in our work for
a source distance of 8.5 kpc.
