REAL ANALYTICITY FOR RANDOM DYNAMICS OF

TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS

VOLKER MAYER, MARIUSZ URBA ´NSKI, AND ANNA ZDUNIK

Abstract. Analyticity results of expected pressure and invariant densities in the
context of random dynamics of transcendental functions are established. These are
obtained by a reﬁnement of work by Rugh [12] leading to a simple approach to
analyticity. We work under very mild dynamical assumptions. Just the iterates of
the Perron-Frobenius operator are assumed to converge.

We also provide a Bowen’s formula expressing the almost sure Hausdorﬀ dimen-
sion of the radial ﬁberwise Julia sets in terms of the zero of an expected pressure
function. Our main application states real analyticity for the variation of this di-
mension for suitable hyperbolic random systems of entire or meromorphic functions.

1. Introduction

Answering a conjecture of Sullivan, Ruelle [11] showed for hyperbolic rational func-
tions that the the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the Julia sets does depend analytically on
the map and gave a local formula for perturbation of the map z 7→ z2. Since then,
there where several results of this type in various contexts and also diﬀerent methods
of proof. The monograph [19] treats the local formula and analyticity has been ob-
tained, for example, in [18] for complex Henon mappings of C2, in [8] for basic sets
of surface diﬀeomorphisms. In the context of entire and meromorphic functions, the
ﬁrst result was obtained in [17], further development appeared in [3, 4] and [14].

Whereas the latter papers use holomorphic motions, Rugh [12] introduces the
method of positive cones and complex cones which allowed him to extend analyticity
results to random dynamics of repellers. The present paper reﬁnes Rugh’s approach,
avoids complex cones, and allows us to get analyticity results for random dynamics of
transcendental entire and meromorphic functions. The following is a particular case
of our general result Theorem 9.10.
Theorem 1.1. Let fη(z) = ηez and let a ∈ ( 1
3e ) and 0 < r < rmax, rmax > 0.
Suppose that η1, η2, .. are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed in D(a, r) and
let

Jr(η1, η2, ...) = {z ∈ Jη1,η2,... : lim inf

be the radial Julia set of (fηn ◦ ... ◦ fη1)n≥1. Then, the Hausdorﬀ dimension of
Jr(η1, η2, ...) is almost surely constant and depends real-analytically on the param-
eters (a, r) provided rmax is suﬃciently small.

The common point in all papers on this topic is the fact that the Hausdorﬀ di-
mension of Julia sets can be expressed in terms of the zero of a pressure function.
This fact goes back to [1] and is now called Bowen’s Formula. This formula also
has been generalized in many contexts and we also provide one (Theorem 9.9). We
would like to mention that the zero of the involved (expected in the random case)
pressure does not really detect the dimension of the whole Julia set but the dimension
of its subset consisting of all radial points. In fact, in the case of hyperbolic rational
functions the radial Julia set and the Julia set itself coincide. However, for transcen-
dental functions, especially for entire functions, there is a deﬁnite diﬀerence between
these sets. McMullen [6] showed that the Julia set of sine or exponential functions is
always maximal equal to two whereas for such hyperbolic functions the dimension of
the radial Julia set, which is often called hyperbolic dimension, is never equal to two
[15, 16].

The formulation of Theorem 1.1 has been chosen deliberately in analogy with Ex-
ample 1.2 in [12] since our present work stems from Rugh’s papers [12, 13]. However,
we were not able to apply directly his machinery. Instead we worked out a reﬁnement
of Rugh’s elegant approach to analyticity. In particular, we avoid any use of Hilbert’s
distance in positive cones and complex cones. Instead we provide a quite simple and
direct calculation (see Proposition 6.1). The outcome, besides the results concerning
random transcendental dynamics, provides an elementary and general tool. In short,
it says that if the thermodynamical formalism holds and if the normalized iterated
transfer operator converges with a uniform speed, then real analyticity holds. Let us
explain this now in more detail.

We consider arbitrary analytic families of holomorphic functions f1,λ, f2,λ, ... having
the following properties. There exists an open set U ⊂ ˆC and δ > 0 such that, for all
w ∈ U and n ≥ 1, every inverse branch g of the non-autonomous composition

f n
j,λ := fj+n−1,λ ◦ ... ◦ fj+1,λ ◦ fj,λ

exists, maps D(w, δ) inside U and has |g′| ≤ γ−1
n where (γn)n is any sequence with
limn→∞ γn = ∞. As for speciﬁc examples, the reader my have in mind rational
functions, functions associated to ﬁnite or inﬁnite iterated function systems or tran-
scendental functions. In such a setting the thermodynamical formalism usually holds
(see [10], [9] and [4]). So, suppose that

j,λ(z)|−t(cid:18) 1 + |z|2
|f ′

Lj,λ,tg(w) = Xfj,λ(z)=w

j,λ,tνj+1,λ,t = ePj(λ,t)νj,λ,t and that there exist functions
reals Pj(λ, t) such that L∗
b (U ) such that ˆLj,λ,t ˆρj,λ,t = ˆρj+1,λ,t where ˆLj,λ,t = e−Pj(λ,t)Lj,λ,t is the

normalized operator. In here, t belongs to an interval I of positive reals and α ≥ 0.
When α = 0 then the above operators are just the usual geometric transfer operators
used, for example, for rational functions or iterated function systems. For the inﬁnite
to one transcendental functions we have to use the additional coboundary factor with
some well chosen ˆτ > 0.

In such a setting the iterated normalized operators are uniformly bounded, i.e.

k ˆLn

j,λ,tk∞ ≤ M for all

there exists M < ∞ such that
(1.1)
j,λ,t = ˆLj+n−1,λ,t◦...◦ ˆLj,λ,t. Also, the densities satisfy the following positivity
where ˆLn
condition as soon as the dynamical system is mixing (see for example Lemma 5.5 in
[5] for the random transcendental case): there exists z0 ∈ U and a > 0 such that
(1.2)

j ≥ 1 , λ ∈ Λ and t ∈ I

ˆρj,λ,t(z0) ≥ a for all

j ≥ 1 , λ ∈ Λ and t ∈ I .

We use a bounded deformation property. It is formulated in Deﬁnition 3.3 and gives
a uniform control of the variation of local inverse branches.

Theorem 1.2. Suppose that fj,λ are of bounded deformation and that the above
thermodynamical formalism holds, in particular with (1.1) and (1.2). Suppose that
the iterated normalized operators have uniform speed: there exists ωn → 0 such that
(1.3)
every g ∈ Lip(U ). Then

j,λ,tg − νj,λ,t(g)ˆρj+n,λ,tk∞ ≤ ωnkgkLip

for every n, j ≥ 0 and

k ˆLn

is a real analytic function.

(λ, t) 7→ ρj,λ,t =

ˆρj,λ,t

ˆρj,λ,t(z0)

In this result we used the space of real Lipschitz functions Lip(U ) equipped with

the norm kgkLip = Lip1(g) + kgk∞ where the Lip1–variation is deﬁned in (4.2).
Theorem 1.2 will be a consequence of Theorem 7.3, Theorem 8.1 is its random
analogue. All these results concern real analyticity of invariant densities. As it is
explained in Remark 8.3, Theorem 8.1 could also include real analyticity of expected
pressure. We worked this out in detail in the case of random transcendental dynamics
and the cumulating result including real analyticity of the hyperbolic dimension is
Theorem 9.10.

2. General setting

We already outlined the setting in the introduction. Here are now all the details.

Suppose given

an open set U ⊂ C, 0 < δ < δ0 and γn → ∞.

We denote by Dz = D(z, δ) the Euclidean disk of radius δ centered at z ∈ C. Let F
be a family of holomorphic functions f : Wf → Vf , where Wf , Vf are open subsets
of ˆC, that has the following property: for every f1, f2, ..., fn ∈ F and for all w ∈ U

4

VOLKER MAYER, MARIUSZ URBA ´NSKI, AND ANNA ZDUNIK

every inverse branch g of the composition fn ◦ ... ◦ f2 ◦ f1 is well deﬁned on D(w, 2δ0)
and veriﬁes

(2.1)

g(Dw) ⊂ U and |g′||Dw ≤ γ−1
n .

As often, replacing the functions by some deﬁnite iterate, we can suppose that γn > 1
for all n ≥ 1.
Example 2.1. The reader may have in mind the following examples:

- fj,λ(z) = z2+λcj where λ ∈ D(0, 1) and |cj| < 1
of hyperbolic rational functions.
- Functions arising from (ﬁnite or inﬁnite alphabet) conformal iterated func-

8 or other suitable perturbations

tions systems.

- Families of transcendental functions like the exponential family in Theorem

1.1 and all the examples treated in [4, 5].

From the above deﬁnition follows that every f ∈ F has the set U in its range Vf

and that f −1(U ) ⊂ U . The radial Julia set of a function f is

(2.2)

Jr(f ) =(z ∈ \n>0

f −n(U ) :

lim inf

n→∞ |f n(z)| < ∞) .

We mainly are interested in non-autonomous and random dynamics. The non-
autonomous radial set of a sequence f1, f2, ... ∈ F is

Jr(f1, f2, ...) =(z ∈ \n>0

(fn ◦ ... ◦ f1)−1(U ) :

lim inf

n→∞ |fn ◦ ... ◦ f1(z)| < ∞) .

Notice that these radial Julia sets coincide with the usual Julia set as soon as the
open set U is bounded which is the case for rational function (after eventual change
of coordinates) and for iterated function systems. Unbounded sets U and radial Julia
sets are necessary for transcendental dynamics.

Our results concern holomorphic families of functions in F. Let Λ be a parameter
space. Without loss of generality, we may assume that Λ is one-dimensional and,
since our results are of local nature, we can restrict to the case where Λ = D(λ0, r) is
an open disk in C having arbitrarily small radius r > 0.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let X be an arbitrary set. Then FX,Λ ⊂ F is called a holomorphic
family if, for every x ∈ X, fx,λ depends holomorphically on λ ∈ Λ. This precisely
means the following. Let x ∈ X. Then there exists an open subset Γx :=Sλ∈Λ{λ} ×
Wfx,λ of C2 such that for every point λ ∈ Λ, Wfx,λ is the domain of fx,λ, and the map
Γx ∋ (λ, z) 7→ fx,λ(z) is holomorphic.

The deterministic case corresponds to X being a singleton, X = Z (or X = N)
indicates non-autonomous dynamics and general X will be used in the last sections of
the paper for random functions depending holomorphically on the parameter λ ∈ Λ.

3. Pairings and bounded deformation

Let us now take X = Z and let fj,λ ∈ FX,Λ be a non-autonomous holomorphic

family. We set

(3.1)
and denote by f −n
λ deﬁned on a disk Dw, where w ∈ U .
This notation, sometimes without the index λ when a particular sequence is under
consideration, will be used in here and in the next sections.

tion theorem along with the fact that the parameter space Λ is simply connected.

unique holomorphic function λ 7→ zλ ∈ f −n
λ (cid:0)D(w, δ0)(cid:1) such that f n
have that zλ = f −n
We denote by (∗, w) such a choice of inverse branch f −1
x,λ,∗ deﬁned on the disks Dw,
w ∈ U . Based on Fact 3.1 and since all inverse branches are well deﬁned on δ–disks
centered in U we can now introduce the notion of pairings used in the sequel. Here and
in the sequel 0 < δ ≤ δ0 and this number δ will be speciﬁed later on (see Proposition
6.1).
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let n ≥ 0. Then, if λ1, λ2 ∈ Λ and w1, w2 ∈ U , |w1 − w2| < δ, two
points zi = zwi,λi ∈ f −n
(wi), i = 1, 2, are called n–pairing, or simply pairing, if they
are related by a holomorphic choice of the inverse branch (∗, w) according to Fact 3.1.
For later use we formulate the following deﬁnition for general sets X.
Deﬁnition 3.3. The family FX,Λ is of bounded deformation if there exists A, D < ∞
such that for every choice of inverse branch (∗, w) we have for every x ∈ X, λ, λ1, λ2 ∈
Λ and w1, w2 ∈ Dw

(3.3)

The concept of bounded deformation has already been used in [4] but without the
condition (3.3). This was so since for dynamically regular transcendental functions
this second condition automatically is satisﬁed (see Lemma 9.4). It is also possible
to relax this second condition in the setting of conformal inﬁnite iterated function
systems as it has been done [14].

Bounded deformation holds for many transcendental families and especially for
λ|.
This condition is automatically satisﬁed for all rational functions and for functions

fλ(z) = λez (see [4]) Notice that (3.2) is equivalent to the fact that (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∂λ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ D |f ′

associated to ﬁnite iterated function systems subject to eventual restriction of the
parameter space. Also, for all systems with compact phase space such as inﬁnite
iterated function systems one can use the theory of holomorphic motions in order
to show that (3.2) holds for free. So, the bounded deformation condition is mainly
instrumental in the case of transcendental, and especially entire, functions.

Remember that the expanding constant γ1 > 1.

Lemma 3.4. If (fx,λ) satisﬁes (3.2) then there exists a (suﬃciently small) choice of
diam(Λ) (depending on δ) such that every 1–pairing (zλ1 , zλ2) satisﬁes |zλ1 −zλ2| < δ.
Proof. Let a 1–pairing be given by zλj = f −1
=
f −1
x,λ2,∗(w1). The condition (3.2) implies that

x,λj,∗(wj), j = 1, 2, and denote z′

1 + Ddiam(Λ)
(cid:3)

In the rest of this paper we suppose that 2r = diamΛ is chosen such that the
conclusion of Lemma 3.4 holds. A further consequence of bounded deformation, this
time of condition (3.3), is the following.

Lemma 3.5. For every 0 < s < r there exists a constant As < ∞ such that for every
1–pairing (zλ1, zλ2 ) we have

Inhere, the argument is well deﬁned and understood to be the principal choice, i.e.
Arg(1) = 0.

Proof. We omit the subscript x ∈ X. By Koebe’s distortion theorem (see for ex.
Theorem 2.7 in [7]) it suﬃces to consider pairings for which fλ1(zλ1) = fλ2(zλ2 ) = w
or, in terms of inverse branches, that zλj = f −1
λj,∗(w), j = 1, 2. Consider then the
function

ϕ(λ) =

x,λ(f −1
f ′
(f −1

x,λ0,∗(w))

, λ ∈ Λ = D(λ0, r) .

It has the properties ϕ(λ0) = 1, A−1 ≤ |ϕ| ≤ A by (3.3). The set of all holomorphic
functions having these three properties is compact which implies the estimation (3.4).

4. Mirror extension

One step towards real analyticity is complexiﬁcation of the transfer operator and
its potential. There are several possibilities for this but the elegant mirror extension

REAL ANALYTICITY FOR RANDOM DYNAMICS

of Rugh is best appropriated. We use mainly the notations he used in his papers
[12, 13]. The mirror of the parameter space Λ and the domain U is the set

(4.1) Υ =n(λ1, λ2, w1, w2) : λ1, λ2 ∈ Λ , w1 ∈ U or w2 ∈ U and |w1 − w2| < δo .

Consider also the w–mirror

: w1 ∈ U or w2 ∈ U and |w1 − w2| < δo .
The initial sets Λ × U and U identify respectively with the diagonals

Υw =n(w1, w2)

∆ = {(λ, λ, w, w) : λ ∈ Λ , w ∈ U}

and ∆w = {(w, w) : w ∈ U} .

On the w–mirror we will consider the space A = C ω
morphic and bounded on in Υw. Let

b (Υw) of functions that are holo-

AR =(cid:8)h ∈ A : h|Υw ∈ R(cid:9) .

Functions from AR are hence real on the diagonal and can therefore be identiﬁed
with a subclass of real functions deﬁned on U . The space A will be equipped with
the sup-norm k.k∞ which makes that we deal with a Banach space.
We need the following notion of Lipschitz variation on n–pairings:
(4.2) Lipn(h) = sup(cid:26)|h(z1, z2) − h(z1, z1)|
Lemma 4.1. For every n ≥ 1 and h ∈ A we have Lipn(h) ≤ khk∞/((1− γ−1

4.1. Potentials and extended operator. The potentials under consideration must
have two properties: they must admit holomorphic mirror extensions and have good
distortion properties. We do not treat the most general setting but focus in the
following on the most important class of potentials and will see in particular that
they have the required properties. So, suppose that ˆτ ≥ 0 is ﬁxed, that I is an open
interval compactly contained in (0,∞) and consider

The transfer operator L = Lλ,t of the function fλ and the potential ϕλ,t is deﬁned by
(4.4)

eϕλ,t(z)g(z)

, w ∈ U ,

Lg(w) = Xfλ(z)=w

where g ∈ C 0
b (U ) is a continuous bounded function on U . The classical case, partic-
ularly when one deals with rational functions or iterated function systems, is when
ˆτ = 0. For transcendental functions ˆτ > 0, i.e.
the additional coboundary term
log(1 + |z|2) − log(1 + |fλ(z)|2), is needed since otherwise the transfer operator is
simply not deﬁned.
These potentials, often called geometric, admit mirror extensions as we explain it
now. In the following, I is a complex neighborhood of I ⊂ R. For w ∈ U , deﬁne
Zw = Λ × Λ × Dw × Dw and notice that Υ = Sw∈U Zw. From Fact 3.1 applied with
n = 1 follows that, to every choice of λ0 ∈ Λ and z0 ∈ f −1
(w), corresponds a choice
of inverse branches f −1

and denote Z −1

for some w′ ∈ U .

w,∗ ⊂ Zw′ ∩ (Λ × Λ × U × U )

Given the deﬁnition of the transfer operator in (4.4), it suﬃces to extend the potentials

w,∗ × I ⊂ Υ × I .

Notice that the expression in the ﬁrst logarithm never equals zero. Also, the expression
in the second logarithm is well deﬁned and never equal to zero since (z1, z2) as well
as (w1, w2) = (fλ1(z1), fλ2(z2)) are pairings and thus their respective distance is
at most δ0 ≤ 1
4 . Since, moreover, the set Λ is simply connected, both logarithms
in (4.6) are well deﬁned and we can and will take the principle branch since for
(λ1, λ2, z1, z2) = (λ, λ, z, z) ∈ ∆ ∩ Z −1
w,∗ both expressions in the arguments of the
logarithms are real positives. We thus have properly deﬁned a map Φ on every set
Z −1

The map Φ is in fact a global well deﬁned on the union Sw,∗ Z −1
to see this, consider two sets Z −1

Given this extended potential and using the inclusion in (4.5), we can now consider

the extended operator Lλ1,λ2,t acting on functions g ∈ A by
(4.7)

Lλ1,λ2,tg(w1, w2) = Xz1,z2

exp(cid:16)Φλ1,λ2,t(z1, z2)(cid:17) g(z1, z2)

where the summation is taken over all pairings (z1, z2) (see Deﬁnition 3.2) such that
fλi(zi) = wi , i = 1, 2.

In the next proposition we will see that the image function Lλ1,λ2,tg ∈ A provided
the initial real operator Lλ,t is bounded. This allows to iterate the operator and we
will do this again in a non-autonomous way. Replacing fλ by fj,λ, j ≥ 1, or even by
fx,λ, x ∈ X, in the deﬁnition (4.3) of the potential gives rise to the operator
(4.8)

Lj = Lj,λ,t

or Lx = Lx,λ,t

respectively. One considers then the non-autonomous n-th composition

and t ∈ I. Then there exist a > 0 such that, with I = I×] − a, a[, the extended
operator Lλ1,λ2,t is a, uniformly for (λ1, λ2, t) ∈ Λ × Λ × I, bounded operator of A.
Moreover, if λ1 = λ2 =: λ and if t ∈ I is real, then L = Lλ,λ,t preserves AR and there
exists K < ∞ such that, for every function h ∈ A,

where (w1, w2) ∈ Υw and n ≥ 1.
Proof. In order to establish boundedness of the operator Lλ1,λ2,t on A we have to
estimate |Lλ1,λ2,t11| where t ∈ I is complex. So let (λ1, λ2, w1, w2) ∈ Υ and let (z1, z2)

The following distortion estimate directly results from the complex version of Koebe’s

and, combining this estimate with the one of I yields the desired Lipschitz property.

5. Complexification of the invariant density

We have to consider appropriate rescaled versions of the operators deﬁned in the
previous section. This section deals with the case where λ1 = λ2 =: λ and t ∈ I is
real. Moreover, here and in the next section both parameters λ, t are ﬁxed and so we
will not indicate them explicitly (we already dropped them in (4.8)):

(5.1)

ˆLj = e−Pj(t)Lj .

The number Pj(t) is usually the topological pressure. Assume that for these rescaled
operators there exist strictly positive functions ˆρm ∈ C 0
b (U ) such that, for some
M < ∞ and for every j ∈ Z and n ≥ 1,
(5.2)
where the limit is with respect to the sup-norm as n → ∞. Then clearly

ˆLn
−n+j11 → ˆρj .

j k∞ ≤ M and

k ˆLn

ˆLj ˆρj = ˆρj+1,

j ∈ Z ,

and, for this reason, these functions are called invariant densities.

The aim now is to extend the invariant densities and (5.2) to the w–mirror Υw. In
j (Lj has been deﬁned in

order to do so, we denote by Ln
(4.7)).
Proposition 5.1. Suppose (5.2) does hold. Then, for every j ∈ Z, the sequence
ˆLn
−n+j11 converges uniformly on compact sets to some function of A. These limit
functions are extensions of ˆρj and they will be denoted by the same symbol. Moreover,

j the extended operator of Ln

|ˆρ(w1, w2) − ˆρ(w1, w1)| ≤ (M + 1)(K + 1)|w1 − w2| , (w1, w2) ∈ Υw ,

and these functions have the invariance property

(5.3)
Proof. Let (w1, w2) ∈ Υw. Then w2 ∈ Dw1. Since Ln
distortion property (4.9) implies that, for n suﬃciently large,

The uniform convergence of Ln
independent of (w1, w2) ∈ Υw, such that
ˆLn

−n+j11 → ˆρj now implies that there exists n0 = n0(j),

−n+j11(w1, w2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ (ˆρm(w1) + 1)(K + 1)|w1 − w2| ≤ (M + 1)(K + 1)|w1 − w2| < ∞
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
for all n ≥ n0. Therefore,(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Montel’s theorem applies and yields normality of the family ( ˆLn
−n+j11)n. Since the
limit of every convergent subsequence coincides with ˆρj on the non-analytic set ∆w
the whole sequence ( ˆLn
−n+j11)n converges to one and the same limit and this limit
belongs to A.
The invariance property (5.3) holds since it holds on the non-analytic set ∆w.
Finally, the limit functions have the required Lipschitz property because of (5.4). (cid:3)

is uniformly bounded by (M +1)(K +1)δ.

In the sequel we will need a diﬀerent normalization. Let l : C 0

b (U ) → R be a
bounded functional. In addition, we will require later on that l is uniformly positive
on the density functions meaning that there exists a > 0 such that

(5.5)

l(ˆρj) ≥ a

for every j ∈ Z.

Example 5.2. Fix any point ξ ∈ U and consider the functional l deﬁned by l(g) =
g(ξ). Such a functional is uniformly positive on the functions ˆρj in the sense of
(5.5) as soon as the system is mixing. This holds in particular for the transcendental
random systems considered in [5]. Lemma 5.5 of that paper shows that there exists
n0 ≥ 1 and a > 0 such that
ˆLn
j 11(ξ) ≥ a for every n ≥ n0 .

Consider then

Lemma 5.3. For every j ∈ Z and n ≥ 1, the map Ψn,j is well deﬁned on the following
neighborhood of ρj in A:

6. Contraction

We shall exploit in detail the convergence of the normalized iterated operators
under the assumption that there is a uniform speed of the convergence in (5.2). Let
us make this precise now (see also the condition (1.3) in Theorem 1.2). We keep in
this section the setting and notation of Section 5 and assume again that (5.2) holds.
We also suppose in the following that δ > 0 has been chosen suﬃciently small such
that

(6.1)

a klk∞ (M (K + 1) + Qklk∞M ) δ ≤
where Q = (M +1)(K+1)

constants since M does not depend on δ and the distortion constant K becomes even
better if δ is replaced by a smaller constant.

Let us now focus on Ln
Ln = Ln

1 , n ≥ 1 and remember that we use the simpliﬁed notation
1 , Ln = Ln

1 , ν = ν1, ˆρ = ˆρ1, Ψn = Ψn,1.

Concerning the functional l, it ﬁrst has to be extended to complex functions in the
usual way and then to functions of h ∈ A by l(h) := l(h|Υw ). Remember also the map
Ψn given by Ψn(g) = Ln(g)
l(Ln(g)) is, for every n ≥ 1, well deﬁned on the neighborhood U1
of ρ (see Lemma 5.3).

Proposition 6.1. Suppose that (5.2), (5.5) and the uniform speed condition hold.
Then, for every δ ∈]0, δ0] suﬃciently small there exists n ≥ 1 such that the diﬀerential
of Ψn at ρ satisﬁes

kDρΨnk∞ ≤

< 1 .

√2
2

Remark 6.2. The proof will show that the integer n does not depend on the operators
Lj, hence not on the functions fj ∈ F (recall that F is the family deﬁned at the
beginning of Section 2), but only on the involved constants such as a, M, ωn. In other
words, n is uniform for all families of operators as long as they satisfy the conditions
(5.2), (5.5) and the uniform speed with the same constants. This is in particular the
case for all Ψn,j, j ∈ Z.
Proof. Let h ∈ A. From (5.8) we get Ψn(ρ) = ρn and

Ψn(ρ + h) =

Ln(ρ) + Ln(h)

l(Ln(ρ)) + l(Ln(h))

=

ρn + Ln(h)/l(Ln(ρ))
1 + l(Ln(h))/l(Ln(ρ))

Hence,

= ρn +

Ln(h)
l(Ln(ρ)) − ρn

l(Ln(h))
l(Ln(ρ))

+ o(khk) .

DρΨn(h) =

Ln(h)
l(Ln(ρ)) − ρn

l(Ln(h))
l(Ln(ρ))

.

Consider ﬁrst the case where h ∈ AR. It suﬃces to consider functions h for which
khk∞ ≤ 1. If we evaluate the above expression at points (w, w) ∈ ∆w of the diagonal
then we can use (6.2) and it follows that there are functions ξn such that kξnk∞ ≤ ωn
and such that

ˆLn(h)(w, w) = ν(h)ˆρn(w) + ξn(w) .

Consequently,

and thus

Ln(h)
l(Ln(ρ))

=

ˆLn(h)
l( ˆLn(ρ))

=

ν(h)ˆρn + ξn

l( ˆLn(ρ))

on ∆w

DρΨn(h)|∆w =

ν(h)ˆρn + ξn
l( ˆLn(ρ)) − ρn

ν(h)l(ˆρn) + l(ξn)

l( ˆLn(ρ))

=

ξn − ρnl(ξn)
l( ˆLn(ρ))

.

This expression can be estimated as follows. From (5.10) we have l(cid:0) ˆLn(ρ)(cid:1) ≥ a
klk∞M .
For the same reasons, i.e. from (5.2) and (5.5), we also have that kρnk∞ = kˆρnk∞
l(ˆρn) ≤ M
a .

REAL ANALYTICITY FOR RANDOM DYNAMICS

15

Altogether it follows that
(6.4)

kDρΨn(h)|∆wk∞ ≤ kξnk∞ (1 + kρnk∞klk∞)
for all n ≥ n0 and some suﬃciently large n0.

a klk∞(cid:19) ≤
For general points (w1, w2) ∈ Υ we can proceed as follows. First of all we have

l( ˆLn(ρ))(cid:16) ˆLn(h)(w1, w2) − ρn(w1, w2)l( ˆLn(h))(cid:17) .

We already have an appropriated estimation for the ﬁrst factor. From the Lipschitz
property of ˆρ (Proposition 5.1) follows that

(M + 1)(K + 1)

|w1 − w2| ≤ Q|w1 − w2| ,

(w1, w2) ∈ Υw
. If we combine this with the Lipschitz behavior

|ρ(w1, w2) − ρ(w1, w1)| ≤
l(ˆρ)
where, we remember, Q = (M +1)(K+1)
of Lnh given in (4.9) and use |w1 − w2| < δ, we ﬁnally get
a klk∞(cid:18)M(cid:18)K +

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
DρΨn(h)(w1, w2)−DρΨn(h)(w1, w1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

δγn(cid:19) + Qklk∞M(cid:19) δ .
Remember now that δ > 0 has been ﬁxed small enough such that (6.1) holds. This
δγn ≤ 1. Then
constant δ being chosen, we can choose n is suﬃciently large such that

M

.

Combing this with (6.4) implies that for real h such that khk∞ ≤ 1 we have, for this
choice of n,

kDρΨn(h)k∞ ≤

1
2

.

If h ∈ A is arbitrary with khk∞ = 1, then h can be expressed in a unique way as
h = h1 + ih2 where both h1, h2 are in AR. Since 1 = khk∞ ≥ max{kh1k∞,kh2k∞},
it suﬃces to use the case of real functions of norm at most one in order to conclude
this proof.
(cid:3)

7. Analyticity: the non-autonomous case

We now come to the ﬁnal part where we investigate analytic dependence on the
parameter λ. In this section we still continue with the non-autonomous case and thus
with the notations introduced in the previous sections 3 to 6. The ﬁrst observation
concerns the extended operators introduced in (4.7).
Proposition 7.1. For every j ∈ Z, the map

(t, λ1, λ2) 7→ Lj,λ1,λ2,t

is holomorphic on I × Λ × Λ.
Proof. This proposition follows from the fact that Lj,λ1,λ2,t is locally represented as
the sum of an absolutely uniformly convergent series of holomorphic functions.
(cid:3)

16

VOLKER MAYER, MARIUSZ URBA ´NSKI, AND ANNA ZDUNIK

Keeping X = Z, we deﬁne now a new Banach space AX of all bounded sections

g = (gj)j∈Z where gj ∈ A for every j ∈ Z and such that

|g| = sup

x∈X ||gx||∞.

The space AX equipped with this norm | · | is a Banach space. The map Ψj,λ1,λ2,t
introduced in (5.9) gives rise to a global map g 7→ Ψλ1,λ2,t(g) deﬁned by

(7.1)

(Ψλ1,λ2,t(g))j+1 =

Lj,λ1,λ2,t(gj )
l(Lj,λ1,λ2,t(gj))

,

j ∈ Z.

Remember also that for t ∈ I real and for λ = λ1 = λ2 the function

ρλ,λ,t = (ρj,λ,λ,t)j∈Z

is a ﬁxed point of Ψλ,λ,t (see (5.8)).
Lemma 7.2. Let λ0 ∈ Λ and let t0 ∈ I be real. Then there exist Uλ0,t0, an open neigh-
in AX and an open neighborhood Wλ0,t0 of the point (λ0, λ0, t0)
borhood of ρλ0,λ0,t0
in Λ × Λ × I such that Ψλ1,λ2,t is well deﬁned on Uλ0,t0 for every (λ1, λ2, t) ∈ Wλ0,t0.
Moreover, the map

Uλ0,t0 × Wλ0,t0 ∋ (h, λ1, λ2, t) 7→ Ψλ1,λ2,t(h) ∈ AX

is holomorphic.
Proof. First of all note that for every j ∈ Z the function

AX × Λ × Λ × I ∋ (h, λ1, λ2, t) 7→ Lj,λ1,λ2,t(hj) ∈ A

is holomorphic since it is linear with respect to the ﬁrst variable, holomorphic with
respect to all three other variables, and one applies Hartogs’ Theorem. Hence, also
the function

AX × Λ × Λ × I ∋ (h, λ1, λ2, t) 7→ l(cid:0)Lj,λ1,λ2,t(hj)(cid:1) ∈ C

is also holomorphic. Now, in order to conclude the proof, we shall ﬁnd Uλ0,t0, an
in AX and an open neighborhood Wλ0,t0 of the point
open neighborhood of ρλ0,λ0,t0
(λ0, λ0, t0) in Λ × Λ × I such that |l(cid:0)Lj,λ1,λ2,t(hj )(cid:1)| is uniformly bounded below for
every h ∈ Uλ0,t0 and for every (λ1, λ2, t) ∈ Wλ0,t0. This will tell us that all coordinates
of the function Ψ(·,·,·)(·) are continuous and uniformly bounded, and ultimately the
function Ψ·,·,·(·) is holomorphic.

In order to ﬁnd these neighborhoods we deduce from (4.10) that kLj,λ1,λ2,t11k∞ is
uniformly bounded above with respect to j ∈ Z and (λ1, λ2, t) ∈ Λ× Λ ×I. Cauchy’s
Integral Formula thus implies that the map (λ1, λ2, t) 7→ Lj,λ1,λ2,t11 is uniformly Lips-
chitz. Consequently, for every ε > 0 there exists a neighborhood Wλ0,t0 of (λ0, λ0, t0)
such that for every h ∈ AX, we have that
(h)| = sup
(7.2)

j∈Z kLj,λ1,λ2,t(h) − Lj,λ0,λ0,t0

|Lλ1,λ2,t(h) − Lλ0,λ0,t0

(h)k∞ ≤ ε|h| .

REAL ANALYTICITY FOR RANDOM DYNAMICS

17

Now, the existence of Uλ0,t0 easily follows now from the above Lipschitz property (7.2)
along with the estimate (5.10) of the proof of Lemma 5.3.
(cid:3)

We are now in position to extend the invariant density ρλ0,λ0,t0

analytically to a
neighborhood of (λ0, λ0, t0) by making use of the Implicit Function Theorem. Indeed,
ρλ0,λ0,t0
, Proposition 6.1 along with the Remark 6.2 implies
that

is a ﬁxed point of Ψλ0,λ0,t0

Ψλ0,λ0,t0| = sup

j∈Z kDρj,λ0 ,λ0 ,t0

Ψj,λ0,λ0,t0k∞ ≤

√2

< 1

and the map (h, λ1, λ2, t) 7→ Ψλ1,λ2,t(h) is analytic (Lemma 7.2). In conclusion we get
the following.
Theorem 7.3. For every (λ0, t0) ∈ Λ × I there exists an open neighborhood Wλ0,t0
in AX, along
in Λ× Λ×I of (λ0, λ0, t0), and Uλ0,t0, an open neighborhood of ρλ0,λ0,t0
with an analytic map (λ1, λ2, t) 7→ ρλ1,λ2,t ∈ Uλ0,t0 such that

Ψλ1,λ2,t(ρλ1,λ2,t) = ρλ1,λ2,t

for every

(λ1, λ2, t) ∈ Wλ0,t0 .

Theorem 1.2 follows now easily.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. An assumption of Theorem 1.2 is that there exists a > 0 and
z0 ∈ U such that ˆρj,λ,t(z0) ≥ a for all (j, λ, t). This enables us to consider the
functional l : C 0
It clearly satisﬁes (5.5) and
thus Theorem 7.3 implies Theorem 1.2 provided the uniform speed condition (6.2)
holds. So, consider g ∈ AR. By Lemma 4.1, g has a Lip1–variation bounded by
kgk∞/((1 − γ−1
1 )δ). This shows that for functions of AR, (1.3) implies (6.2) with
slightly modiﬁed sequence ωn.

b (U ) → R deﬁned by l(g) := g(z0).

Remark 7.4. Note that the uniqueness part of the Implicit Function Theorem guar-
antees the functions ρλ,λ,t, t ∈ I being real, to coincide with the ones resulting from
Proposition 5.1.

8. Analyticity: the random case

The ﬁnal part of this paper is devoted to random dynamics. So we now consider
the following setting. Let X be now an arbitrary set and B a σ–algebra on X. We
consider a probability space (X,B, m). As usual, the randomness will be modeled by
an invertible map θ : X → X preserving the measure m.
In
addition, we now require that these functions are measurable meaning that the map
(x, z) 7→ fx,λ(z) is measurable for every λ ∈ Λ. We are interested in the dynamics of
the random compositions

Let FX,Λ be a holomorphic family of functions as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.2.

where λ ∈ Λ and x ∈ X.

f n
x,λ = fθn−1(x),λ ◦ ... ◦ fx,λ, n ≥ 1,

18

The space of analytic functions AX has also the same meaning as before except
that the functions depend measurably on x ∈ X. Thus, g ∈ AX if λ 7→ gx(λ) is
holomorphic on Λ for every x ∈ X, if x 7→ gx(λ) is measurable for every λ ∈ Λ and if

|g| := ess sup

x∈X kgxk∞ < ∞.

The transfer operators Lx,λ,t must also have measurable dependence on x ∈ X. Notice
that one can show with the help of the Measurable Selection Theorem (see [2]) that
this is indeed the case. In the case of transcendental functions this has been worked
out in Lemma 3.6 of [5]. In this case, the invariant densities ρx,λ,t as well as their
extensions ρx,λ,λ,t also depend measurably on x ∈ X since they are obtained as a
limit of measurable maps (see (5.2) and Proposition 5.1). Clearly, exactly as for
the above composition of the functions fx,λ, the iterated operators are of the form
Ln
x,λ,t = Lθn−1(x),λ,t ◦ ... ◦ Lx,λ,t. In the same way, the deﬁnitions given in the part
on non-autonomous dynamics have straightforward counterparts. For example, the
invariance of the density is the relation ˆLx,λ,t ˆρx,λ,t = ˆρθ(x),λ,t and the uniform speed
assumption (6.2) takes on the following form:

k ˆLn

x,λ,th − νx(h)ˆρθn(x),λ,tk∞ ≤ ωnkhk∞ for every h ∈ AR , n ≥ 1 .

(8.1)
Also, the deﬁnition of the global map g 7→ Ψλ1,λ2,t(g), g ∈ AX, is
x ∈ X.

(Ψλ1,λ2,t(g))θ(x) =

Lx,λ1,λ2,t(gx)
l(Lx,λ1,λ2,t(gx))

,

Proceeding now exactly as in the previous section and applying the Implicit Func-
tion Theorem in the Banach space (AX,|.|) we see that Theorem 7.3 holds also in
the present random setting. Notice that this result is written in a global way so that,
with the same notations, it is valid in the non-autonomous and in the random case.
The results can now be summarized as follows. Assume again that the expanding
property (2.1) is satisﬁed, that this family is of bounded deformation (Deﬁnition 3.3)
and the bounded distortion of the arguments of (3.4) holds. Finally, we assume that
the, most natural in this context, thermodynamical formalism property (5.2) holds.

Theorem 8.1. Suppose the following:

(1) There exists a bounded functional l : C 0

the invariant densities (see (5.5)).

b (U ) → R that is uniformly positive on

(2) The uniform speed condition (8.1) holds.

Then, the map (λ1, λ2, t) 7→ ρλ1,λ2,t ∈ AX is analytic. In particular for a.e. x ∈ X
the map (λ1, λ2, t) 7→ ρx,λ1,λ2,t ∈ AX is analytic.
Remark 8.2. Note that the uniqueness part of the Implicit Function Theorem guar-
antees the functions ρλ,λ,t, t ∈ I being real, to coincide with the ones resulting from
Proposition 5.1.

Remark 8.3. In fact, in this theorem we also could include real analyticity of the
expected pressure as deﬁned in the transcendental case in (9.4) and established in
Lemma 9.5.

REAL ANALYTICITY FOR RANDOM DYNAMICS

9. Transcendental random systems

In this last part we apply the preceding results to the case of transcendental random
systems. Such systems have been considered in [5] and the full thermodynamical
formalism including spectral gap property has been shown there. We here complete
the picture in establishing analyticity in this general context. As a consequence we
get a proof of the particular example of the Introduction (Theorem 1.1).

Assume now that the functions of FX,Λ are transcendental functions and that this
family consists of transcendental random systems as deﬁned in [5]. We use notation
from that paper like Jx,λ for the Julia set of (f n
x,λ)n≥1. Straightforward adaption of
(2.2) leads to the deﬁnition of the radial Julia set Jr(fx,λ) ⊂ Jx,λ.
Here are some other notions from [5] that are necessary for the present work.
First of all, the following minor technical conditions are used in [5] with the same
enumeration:

Condition 2. There exists T > 0 such that

(cid:16)Jx ∩ DT(cid:17) ∩ f −1
(z)| ≤ CR,N for all

x (cid:0)Jθ(x) ∩ DT(cid:1) 6= ∅ , x ∈ X .

x (cid:1)′
|(cid:0)f N

Condition 4. For every R > 0 and N ≥ 1 there exists CR,N such that
(cid:0)DR(cid:1) and x ∈ X .

Then, there must be some common bound for the growth of the (spherical) charac-
teristic functions ˚Tx(r) = ˚T (fx, r) of fx, x ∈ X. We use here a strengthened version
of the Condition 1 in [5] and would like to mention that this is only used in order to
show that the expected pressure function has a zero (see Proposition 9.7):

z ∈ DR ∩ f −N

x

Condition 1’. There exists ρ > 0 and ι > 0 such that

(9.1)

ιrρ ≤ ˚Tx(r) ≤ ι−1rρ

for all

r ≥ 1 and all x ∈ X .

Deﬁnition 9.1. The transcendental random family (fx,λ) ⊂ FX,Λ is called:

(1) Topologically hyperbolic if there exists 0 < δ0 ≤ 1

n ≥ 1 and w ∈ Jθn(x) all holomorphic inverse branches of f n
on D(w, 2δ0).

4 such that for every x ∈ X,
x,λ are well deﬁned

(2) Expanding if there exists c > 0 and γ > 1 such that

for every z ∈ Jx \ f −n

|(f n

x,λ)′(z)| ≥ cγn
x,λ (∞) and every x ∈ X.

(3) Hyperbolic if it is both topologically hyperbolic and expanding.

Deﬁnition 9.2. The transcendental random family (fx,λ) ⊂ FX,Λ satisﬁes the bal-
anced growth condition if there are α2 > max{0,−α1} and κ ≥ 1 such that for every
(x, λ) ∈ X × Λ and every z ∈ f −1
(9.2)

κ−1 ≤

2 ≤ κ .

20

VOLKER MAYER, MARIUSZ URBA ´NSKI, AND ANNA ZDUNIK

In the following we always assume that the above conditions are satisﬁed.
Deﬁnition 9.3. A transcendental holomorphic random family (fx,λ) ⊂ FX,Λ will be
called admissible if

(1) the base map θ : X → X is ergodic with respect to the measure m,
(2) the system (fx,λ) is hyperbolic,

(3) the balanced growth condition is satisﬁed,

(4) the Conditions 1’, 2 and 4 hold.

In this context, the right potential to work with is ϕλ,t as deﬁned in (4.3) but with
ˆτ = α1 + τ where τ < α2 is arbitrarily close to α2 such that t > ρ/ˆτ > ρ/α,
α = α1 + α2. With such a choice, the following has been shown in [5]:

- The full thermodynamical formalism holds.

In particular, there exist νx,t, the
Gibbs states, in fact generalized eigenmeasures of dual transfer operators, and unique
equilibrium states

µx,t = ˆρx,tνx,t, νx,t(ˆρx,t) = 1.

Moreover, for every t > ρ/α, there are constants At, Ct < ∞ and εt > 0 such that
for all z ∈ U and x ∈ X .
(9.3)

ˆρx,t(z) ≤ Ct(1 + |z|)−εtt

kˆρx,tk∞ ≤ At

and

- The normalized iterated transfer operator converge exponentially fast (Theorem 5.1
(2)).

For admissible transcendental random families one has the bounded deformation
property. Indeed, the following uniform control is a complete analogue of Lemma 9.7
in [4] and can be shown with exactly the same normal family argument than in the
proof given in [4].

Lemma 9.4. For every ε > 0 there exists 0 < rε < r such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

λ,∗(w))

λ(f −1
f ′
(f −1
f ′
λ0
for every (w,∗) and λ ∈ D(λ0, rε).
If we combine this with Koebe’s distortion theorem (see for ex. Theorem 2.7 in [7]
then it follows that the condition (3.3) of the bounded deformation property always
holds. The ﬁrst property of the bounded deformation property (3.2) holds for many
families (see again [4]) and clearly for the exponential family in Theorem 1.1.

λ0,∗(w)) − 1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

9.1. Expected pressure. Fix t > ρ/α. From Theorem 3.1 in [5] we know that
supx∈X |Px,λ(t)| < ∞ for every λ ∈ Λ. We can therefore introduce the expected
pressure

(9.4)

Analyticity of expected pressure results from the following.

EPλ(t) =ZX

Px,λ(t)dm(x) .

REAL ANALYTICITY FOR RANDOM DYNAMICS

21

Lemma 9.5. For the expected pressure we have the following expression

EPλ(t) =ZX

log l (Lx,λ,tρx,λ,t) dm(x)

and the function (λ, t) 7→ EPλ(t) is real analytic.
Proof. On the one hand we know that Lx,λ,t ˆρx,λ,t = ePx,λ(t) ˆρθ(x),λ,t and on the other
hand Lx,λ,tρx,λ,t = l (Lx,λ,tρx,λ,t) ρθ(x),λ,t. Since ρx,λ,t = ˆρx,λ,t

l(ˆρx,λ,t) it follows that

log (l (Lx,λ,tρx,λ,t)) = Px,λ(t) + log(cid:0)l(ˆρθ(x),λ,t)(cid:1) − log (l(ˆρx,λ,t)) .

It suﬃces to integrate this expression with respect to m and to use that the measure
m is θ–invariant. The statement on analyticity results from this expression and the

holomorphic.

fact (see Theorem 8.1) that the function (λ1, λ2, t) 7→ l(cid:0)Lx,λ1,λ2,tρx,λ1,λ2,t(cid:1) ∈ C is
9.2. Bowen’s Formula. This formula concerns a ﬁxed random system or, in other
words, a ﬁxed parameter λ ∈ Λ. We can therefore neglect this parameter throughout
this subsection and consider a ﬁxed random system FX . As our preparation for the
proof of Bowen’s Formula we are to deal with expected pressure in greater detail.
Lemma 9.6. Let t > ρ/α. Then for m-a.e. x ∈ X and every w ∈ Jx,

This characterization of expected pressure along with hyperbolicity of the system

havior of the expected pressure.

Proof. Analyticity has been established in Lemma 9.5, the strict monotonicity and
the limit at +∞ are straightforward and standard. It remains to analyze the behavior
of EP near ρ/α. In order to do so, we will use Condition 1’ along with Nevanlinna
Theory as explained in [5]. In the following we use the notations from that paper
especially those from the proof of Lemma 3.17.
It is show there that there exists
k > 0 and ˜R0 > 0 suﬃciently large such that for every R > ˜R0 and every w ∈ U ∩ DR

Lx11DR(w) ≥ kR−(α2−τ )tZ R

rR

˚Tx(r)
rˆτ t+1 dr

where rR = ω−1(8 log R) and where ω comes from Condition 1 still in [5]. This
condition being replaced here by Condition 1’, we have ω(r) = ιrρ and ˚Tx(r) ≥ ιrρ.
Therefore, still with ˆτ = α1 + τ and with ˆk = kι, we get uniformly in w ∈ U ∩ DR
and x ∈ X the lower bound

Lx11DR(w) ≥ˆkR−(α2−τ )tZ R

rR

dr

rˆτ t−ρ+1 dr

=ˆkR−(α2−τ )t(cid:0) log R − log rR + O(ˆτ t − ρ)(cid:1) .

The number τ ∈ (0, α2) is chosen in dependence of t arbitrarily close to α2 such
that t > ρ/(α1 + τ ) > ρ/(α) (see Remark 1.2 in [5]). It is therefore clear that for
every H > 0 one can choose R = RH > ˜R0 and then tH > ρ/α such that for every
t ∈ (ρ/α, tH )

Lx11DR(w) ≥ H for every w ∈ U ∩ DR , x ∈ X .

The formula limtցρ/α EP(t) = +∞ follows now by induction and Lemma 9.6.
Lemma 9.8. For every t > ρ/α, the function (x, z) 7→ log |f ′
meaning that the integral

x(z)| is µt–integrable

(cid:3)

log |f ′
is well-deﬁned and ﬁnite. Moreover, χt > 0.

χt :=ZXZJx

x(z)| dµx,t(z) dm(x)

Proof. Let t > ρ/α. The expanding property implies χt > 0. It remains to show that
χt < ∞. It follows from the estimate given in (9.3) that

and from invariance that

log |z| dµx,t dm(x) =ZXZJx

x(z)|.

Thus, both functions (x, z) 7→ log |z| and (x, z) 7→ log |fx(z)| are µt–integrable. From
the balanced growth condition follows now µt–integrability of the function (x, z) 7→
log |f ′
Proposition 9.7 yields the existence of a unique zero h > ρ/α of the expected pres-
sure function. It turns out that this number coincides almost everywhere with the
Hausdorﬀ dimension of the radial Julia set.

Theorem 9.9 (A version of Bowen’s Formula). If (fx)x∈X is a admissible random
system, then

HD(Jr(fx)) = h for m-a.e. x ∈ X.

Proof. Since µh is an ergodic measure, there is M ∈ (0, +∞) such that

µh(cid:0)Jr(x, M )(cid:1) = 1 for all x ∈ X1 ,
where X1 ⊂ X is some measurable set with m(X1) = 1, and

Since the set of all integers l ≥ 1 for which (9.16) holds is inﬁnite (as z ∈ Jr(x, n)),
taking the limit of the right-hand side of (9.20) over all such ls. and applying (9.21),

Consequently, HD(Jr(x, n)) ≤ h for all x ∈ X4. Together with (9.15) and σ-stability
of Hausdorﬀ dimension, we thus get that HD(Jr(x)) ≤ h for all x ∈ X4. Along with
(9.14) this ﬁnishes the proof.

9.3. Conclusion. All in all we now get the following analyticity result for the di-
mension of the radial limit set.
Theorem 9.10. Suppose that the transcendental holomorphic random family (fx,λ) ⊂
FX,Λ is admissible and let hλ be the ﬁberwise Hausdorﬀ dimension of the radial limit
set of (fx,λ)x∈X , λ ∈ Λ. Then, λ 7→ hλ is analytic.
Proof. Bowen’s Formula shows that hλ is the unique zero of the expected pressure
function. The later is analytic and ∂
∂tEPλ(t) < 0 (Proposition 9.7). Therefore the
Implicit Function Theorem applies and yields analyticity of λ 7→ hλ.

It remains to discuss the initial example given in the Introduction.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let U = {z ∈ C : ℜz > 1}. It is well known that fη = ηez is
a hyperbolic exponential map if η is real and 1
η (U ) ⊂ U .
Therefore, there exists b > 0 such that f −1

6e . Moreover, f −1
η (U ) ⊂ U for every η ∈ Ωb where

6e < η < 5

It follows that fηn ◦ ... ◦ fη1, n ≥ 1, deﬁnes an expanding non-autonomous sequence
that satisﬁes (2.1) for any choice of η1, η2, ... ∈ Ωb. It is straightforward that we thus
have for these parameters a admissible transcendental random family excepted that
we have to explain the random model.

In order to do so, let X = D(0, 1)Z, B the Borel σ-algebra, m the inﬁnite product
measure of the normalized Lebesgue measure of the unit disk and θ the left-shift map
on X.

Consider now parameters (a, r) such that D(a, r) ⊂ Ωb/2. Let x ∈ X and x0 the
0–coordinate of x. We associate to these parameters the function ηez = (a + rx0)ez.
In such a way we get for every x ∈ X a family (a, r) 7→ fη. However, this family only
depends real analytically on (a, r) ∈ R2. In order to turn this into a holomorphic
family it suﬃces to replace these parameters by complex ones with small imaginary
part such that a + rx0 ∈ Ωb for every x0 ∈ D(0, 1). Theorem 9.10 applies to this
family.
