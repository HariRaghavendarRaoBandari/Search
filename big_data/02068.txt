The holographic approach to study strongly coupled superconductors in the presence of dark
matter is reviewed. We discuss the inﬂuence of dark matter on the superconducting transition
temperature of both s-wave and p-wave holographic superconductors. The upper critical ﬁeld,
coherence length, penetration depth of holographic superconductors as well as the metal-insulator
transitions have also been analysed.
Issues related to the validity of AdS/CFT correspondence
for the description of superconductors studied in the laboratory and possible experiments directed
towards the detection of dark matter are discussed. In doing so we shall compare our assumptions
and assertions with those generally accepted in the elementary particle experiments aimed at the
detection of dark matter particles.

INTRODUCTION

The superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phe-
nomenon1 appearing in many condensed matter systems
and characterized by the expulsion of the magnetic ﬁeld
and zero resistance state at suﬃciently low temperature.
The superconducting rings show quantization of mag-
netic ﬂux. This is also true for vortices in the type
two superconductors. A number of other quantum ef-
fects appear if the superconductor is in contact with nor-
mal metal (Andreev reﬂection) or other superconductors
(Josephson eﬀect). All these properties and phenomena
are at the heart of numerous applications of supercon-
ductors.

Zero resistivity state allows the construction and op-
eration of powerful superconducting electromagnets for
important scientiﬁc and medical applications. The su-
perconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)
are the most sensitive magnetometers. SQUIDs allow for
the precise measurements of the ﬂux quantum φ = h/2e,
where e is the electron charge and h the Planck con-
stant. These devices have been proposed and used in the
search for the magnetic monopole; the elementary parti-
cle postulated2 by Dirac in 1931. The search3 for this
elusive particle continues4, with the hope that it might
address an important question of composition of dark
matter5.

According to standard theory of gravity based on New-
tonian dynamics the explanation of many astrophysical
observations require the existence of large amount of
matter that cannot be seen with telescopes, and is thus
termed dark matter. The Planck satellite mission reveals
that dark matter constitutes 26.8% of the total mass of
the Universe, while ordinary matter makes only 4.9% of
it. The rest6 is the mysterious dark energy, 68.3%.

The nature of the dark matter is still unknown. Besides
magnetic monopoles other particles have been proposed
as possible candidates. Many experiments7 aimed at the
direct detection of the postulated dark matter particles

have been proposed. Some of them8,9 rely on the use
of superconductors and study of subtle quantum (inter-
ference) eﬀects. We shall not discuss various proposals
for the dark matter particles10 here. Instead we model
the dark matter classically by the additional ﬁeld with
properties similar to the Maxwell ﬁeld and study the in-
ﬂuence of dark matter on the properties of holographic
superconductors. The main goal of the present work is
to discuss how the presence of dark matter may change
the properties of holographic superconductors. Assuming
that the holographic analogy teaches us about the strong
coupling aspects of superconductors studied in the labo-
ratory we discuss possible experiments directed towards
the detection of this elusive but dominant part of matter
in the Universe.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We dis-
cuss the main ideas of the general holographic approach
to study strongly coupled models in Section II, where we
also brieﬂy state the main eﬀects of the dark sector on
the properties of superconductors. In Section III we shall
discuss general questions of matter composition and the
geometry of the Universe, chances of direct detection of
dark matter ﬁeld in the laboratory by long time observa-
tions of superconductors. We also oﬀer some remarks on
the possibility of superconducting condensation of dark
matter. We end up with conclusions.

II. THE EFFECT OF DARK MATTER ON
SUPERCONDUCTORS WITHIN ADS/CFT

CORRESPONDENCE

The gauge/gravity duality is also known as holo-
graphic duality or anti-de Sitter/conformal ﬁeld the-
ory (AdS/CFT) correspondence11. It is the conjectured
equivalence between the ﬁeld theory in the Minkowski
space-time forming the boundary of the Einstein – anti-
de Sitter (AdS) and the gravity theory in the bulk of
the AdS space-time, see Fig. 1. There exist a kind of

on the non-zero value at temperatures (provided by the
black hole) lower than the characteristic critical temper-
ature Tc. The temperature dependence of < O2 > close
to Tc shows the behavior characteristic for the super-
conducting order parameter ∆ with the mean-ﬁeld type
dependence ∝ (1 − T /Tc)1/2 close to Tc.
The calculated14 ratio 2p< O2(T = 0) >/Tc ≈ 8 is char-

acteristic for strongly coupled superconductors. The
other strong coupling eﬀects include the upward cur-
vature seen in the temperature dependence of the up-
per critical ﬁeld calculated via AdS/CFT correspon-
dence15–19. It leads to the value of zero temperature mag-
netic ﬁeld higher than the estimate based on the equa-
relating upper critical

ﬁeld at T = 0 to its derivative close to Tc. The upward
curvature, which is observed in many high temperature
superconductors in the standard approach20 requires in-
ter alia strong potential or spin-orbit scattering, while it
seems to appear quite naturally in the strong coupling.
Since the ﬁrst attempt to apply
the gravity to construct holographic superconductors14,
there appeared a number of papers generalizing the ap-
proach in various directions. Among them one has
to mention the complex gravity backgrounds including
higher order curvatures21, non-linear Born-Infeld elec-
trodynamics22, etc.
Important results have been ob-
tained by changing the chemical potential µ, which in
the gauge/gravity theory is given by the asymptotic be-
havior of the Maxwell ﬁeld Φ = µ − ρ/r + ..., where ρ
is charge density. It has been found that increase of µ
at T = 0 results in the insulator to metal transition,
which in the gravity theory is related to Hawking-Page
transition23 between black soliton and black hole. Also
superconductors with symmetries other than s-wave have
been studied24.

Dark matter and AdS/CFT. Of special interest are the
papers studying the eﬀect of dark matter ﬁeld on such
properties of superconductors as transition temperature,
the condensate amplitude, upper critical ﬁeld, coherence
length, penetration depth, etc. One assumes that besides
the Maxwell ﬁeld there exist another U(1)-gauge ﬁeld,
which represents that part of the matter in the Universe,
which is not visible with telescopes.

where κ2 = 8πGn is an n-dimensional gravitational

time. The matter action contains the Abelian-Higgs sec-
tor coupled to the second U (1)-gauge ﬁeld. It is provided

(UV limit). Thus distance r correspond to the renormalisa-
tion group parameter deciding about the coupling strength.

a ’dictionary’ which relates the results of calculations in
one theory to those obtained or expected in the other.
In other words, every property in one theory has a coun-
terpart in the other theory. In order to study temper-
ature dependent phenomena one assumes the existence
of black hole in the gravity theory. The AdS/CFT cor-
respondence is typically viewed as a prescription how to
calculate the expectation values of the operators in the
strongly coupled ﬁeld theory by means of the gravity the-
ory. The latter is typically easy endeavor as the gravity
action is dominated by classic ﬁeld conﬁgurations. It is
believed that the correspondence provides the strong cou-
pling - weak coupling duality12. In technical terms13 the
correspondence is related to the fact, that the partition
function of the ﬁeld theory Z[A(x, t)], where A(x, t) is the
source ﬁeld that couples to the currents j(x, t), equals to
that of the gravity dual Z[A(x, r, t)] with the boundary
condition limr→∞ A(x, r, t) = A(x, t). As mentioned the
latter partition function is prevailed by the classical ﬁeld
conﬁgurations of gravitational ﬁeld and thus given by the
exponential of the classical action of the aforementioned
conﬁgurations.

The ﬁrst successful description of strongly coupled su-
perconductors by gauge/gravity duality14 relied on the
planar Schwarzschild - anti - de Sitter black hole and
Maxwell electrodynamics. The scalar complex ﬁeld Ψ(r)
is coupled to the Maxwell ﬁeld represented by the time
component of the four-vector At = Φ(r).

ducting order parameter. Both < O1 > and < O2 > take

tively. On the other hand, α is a coupling constant be-
tween U (1) ﬁelds. Analysis of the three-dimensional su-
perconducting systems living in a 3+1 dimensional space-
time, requires n = 5 dimensional gravity theory.

Analogies and diﬀerences. For condensed matter spe-
cialists it is important to note that the ﬁeld Ψ plays here
a very similar role as (usually denoted by the same sym-
bol) ﬁeld in the Ginzburg-Landau approach. There is,
however, a very important diﬀerence. While the conden-
sation in Ginzburg-Landau approach requires non-zero
value of the quartic parameter λψ, in the gravity theory
the ﬁeld Ψ undergoes condensation for λψ ≡ 0. The other
crucial diﬀerence has to do with the mass parameter m2.
Its counterpart in Ginzburg - Landau approach is usu-
ally denoted by a and is assumed to change sign at the
superconducting transition temperature: a = a′(T − Tc)
taking on negative value in the superconducting state.
In a formal analogy, in the gravity approach m2 < 0 in
the superconducting state. However, the stability of the
AdS n + 1 dimensional space-time requires fulﬁlling the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound m2 > −n2/4. It means
the lower limit on the the ’mass’ term in holographic
superconductor. While it is generally accepted that the
scalar ﬁeld condenses25 for m2 < 0, there are papers
proving the existence of the solution for m2 > 0 in speciﬁc
conditions. Kim et al. have shown26 that the holographic
superconductor may still exist for the case m2 > 0. They
found that if the mass of the scalar ﬁeld increases, the
system undergoes ’the phase space or conﬁguration space
folding’, i.e., the two very close boundary conditions can
lead to the diﬀerent states. For instance, one with the
broken symmetry while the other is a symmetric one.

The other tantalizing question is the inquire about the
meaning of the limit for superconducting material, if any?
Would its existence translate to the the limit of the super-
conducting gap function? In the BCS approach the mag-
nitude of the gap function is directly proportional to the
electron-phonon coupling constant. However, the very
large values of the coupling constant make the BCS weak
coupling approach not valid. The Eliashberg method
usually considered as a strong coupling theory, in fact
takes retardation eﬀects into account and is valid be-
yond BCS limit. However, based on the expansion with
respect to electron-phonon coupling approach the theory
is not a strong coupling one and possible instabilities at
larger couplings have been analyzed and predicted. The
detailed analysis of the relation between Breitenlohner-
Freedman bound and the gaps in the ﬁeld theory would
shed additional light on the superconducting instability
of materials, but this is outside the scope of the present

paper.

Some results. Studying the inﬂuence of dark matter
on the properties of superconductors we are mainly inter-
ested in the changes of their properties as characterized
by the coupling constant α (see Eq. 2). Working in the
probe limit we have found that dark matter sector aﬀects
various properties of the holographic superconductors de-
pending on their symmetry and other details. In particu-
lar the superconducting transition temperature Tc of the
s-wave superconductor with dark matter (DM) is modi-
ﬁed as T DM
= Tc + ˜αT0, where Tc is the superconducting
transition temperature without dark sector and T0 is con-
stant depending on the dimensionality of space-time and
other model parameters, ˜α = 1 − α2/4. Similar depen-
dence for the model of SU(2) Yang-Mills p-wave holo-
graphic superconductor reads T DM
= Tc/ ˜α1/6, while in
the the Maxwell vector p-wave holographic superconduc-
tor with dark matter sector and for real components of
the vector ﬁeld give us the same description of the phase
transitions as the s-wave model15–19. It is worth noting
the dependence of the superconducting transition tem-
perature Tc on the charge density ρ, which is Tc ∝ ρ1/3.
The value 1/3 of the power factor in a three dimensional
superconductor seem to be strong coupling modiﬁcation
of the exponent 2/3 known from the Bose - Einstein con-
densation of charged local pair bosons in narrow band
superconductors27. The coherence length ξ and the pen-
etration depth λ both feature the dependence on the cou-
pling α with λDM = λ√ ˜α and ξDM = ξ/√˜α. As a result
the presence of dark matter inﬂuences both length scales
and the parameter κDM = ˜ακ. As κDM may decrease
with increasing α the superconductor may change18 from
the weakly second type (with κDM > 1/√2) to ﬁrst kind
(κDM < 1/√2). If observed, this change28 could be an
important ﬁngerprint of the eﬀect of dark matter on real
superconductors and not only on the holographic ones.
Most of the above results have been obtained in the probe
limit, see however29 for recent analysis of the eﬀect of
dark sector with back-reaction taken into account.

III. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES

Very often we are asked about the motivation why
to study the inﬂuence of a dark matter sector in holo-
graphic superconductors. Typically interlocutors admit
that dark matter may play an important role in gravi-
tational theories of the Universe and inquire: if it is im-
portant for superconductors; if and how the dark matter
might be detected in the laboratory by studying real su-
perconductors. Another important aspect of discussion is
related to the fact that our Universe has Einstein - de Sit-
ter geometry, but hypothetical anti- de Sitter space-time
is assumed in the gauge/gravity correspondence. The
above problems are at the heart of the gauge/gravity du-
ality.

Relation to real

life systems. The ﬁrst question is
whether the superconductors studied in the holographic

theory have something to do with real life systems stud-
ied in the lab. We tend to believe that the AdS/CFT
analogy describes or at least gives hints about the be-
havior of real systems. We have the following arguments
in favor of this conviction:

(i) The duality has helped to understand the extremely
low viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma. While pertur-
bative approaches30 fail to provide the understanding of
the puzzle, the gauge-gravity duality ﬁnds the universal
scale for the viscosity31.

Applied to study superconductors the gauge-gravity
duality describes the behavior expected to be observed
in real life superconductors (phase transition, critical ex-
ponents, etc.). That it provides sensible and not random
answers for various questions is an important argument
in favor of its relevance to real world. We mention here
but a few examples.

(ii) It shows the appearance of condensation at a given
temperature with correct or close to correct temperature
dependence of the parameter expected to describe the
condensate14 and the expected large value of the ratio
between the gap and the superconducting transition tem-
perature.

(iii) As a further example we quote a very nontrivial
predictions of the AdS/CFT theory which do agree with
other (quantum critical) models32. In that work the cal-
culations of the dynamical pair susceptibility by Zaanen
and collaborators are presented. Moreover the predic-
tions are expected to be measured in the near future.

(iv) The analogy seem to provide deep understanding
of the relations (scaling properties) observed near quan-
tum critical points as observed in real materials. This is
demonstrated e.g. in recent studies of incoherent trans-
port in clean metals33.

Summarizing this aspect, it seems that the AdS/CFT
is saying something new about condensed matter prob-
lems in general and holographic superconductors in par-
ticular and this is encouraging. We accept the arguments
of P. W. Anderson that many properties of superconduc-
tors34 are ”overdetermined by experimental facts” and
that not every property has been adequately answered
by the AdS/CFT duality. However, we think that the
discussed applications provide an opportunity for ﬁeld
theories by ﬁnding solutions to strong coupling problems.
At the same time the calculations provide real life appli-
cations of string theory ideas.

AdS/CFT vs. dS Universe. The relation between the
description of the system possessing conformal property
by the ﬁeld theory and by the gravity dual is really a
tricky one and all the objections may eventually turn out
well founded. Our understanding of the gauge-gravity
duality is the following. Embedding the ﬁeld theory into
the AdS space time with the ordinary matter enables us
to calculate the properties of the system (which the ﬁeld
theory is supposed to describe) in the strong coupling12
by perturbative methods of the gravity theory evaluated
at the boundary. Thus we treat/consider the AdS/CFT
correspondence as a kind of calculus, which enables rela-

4

tively easy access to strong coupling limit of the CFT.

Using the AdS/CFT approach and studying the prop-
erties of holographic superconductors in the background
with dark matter sector we rely on the following. First
we accept that the gauge-gravity duality teaches us about
strongly coupled superconductors which are produced
and studied in the laboratories. Some examples of this
can be found in13. The AdS/CFT correspondence relies
on the AdS space time. Its validity to perform the cal-
culations is not related whether the Universe in which
the superconductors exist itself forms the AdS or de Sit-
ter space-time. The dark matter existence seem to be
obvious from astrophysical data as discussed in the In-
troduction. If it interacts with ordinary matter as pro-
posed in Eq. (2) and quantiﬁed by the coupling constant
α, so it modiﬁes the behavior of the ordinary matter.
These modiﬁcations are found to inﬂuence the supercon-
ducting transition temperature and could, in principle,
be observed as the annual changes of the properties of
superconductors following the expected annual changes
in the distribution of the dark matter35.

Dark matter. Finally we discuss the relation between
the dark matter as required in astrophysics and its eﬀect
on the behavior of superconductors. The very notion
of dark matter is an old one. The term ﬁrst appeared
in the paper by Koteyev and is used ever since36. Our
understanding of the problem relies on the following ar-
guments, supported by the observations and related work
aimed at the detection of dark matter. There exist nu-
merous astronomical observation which are described in
terms of dark matter. The precise nature of it is not well
known. As already mentioned diﬀerent particles have
been proposed as the candidates.
If the interpretation
of astronomical observations in terms of dark matter is
true, so dark matter must exist and, through its coupling
- here α - will modify the properties of the ordinary mat-
ter and thus also the properties of superconductors. We
try to pinpoint, how it may change the properties of the
superconductors. If the calculated changes of the holo-
graphic superconductors are indeed expected to apply to
real materials than there is a chance to observe these
changes and thus get an information on the local dark
matter distribution.

The most important question of the experimental Col-
leagues is related to the feasibility of the detection of the
dark matter in the laboratory. We all accept the fact
that the dark matter exists over there in Cosmos. But if
the dark matter exists, as required by the astrophysical
observations, so it is present not only in the macrocosm,
but also in our neighborhood and may be spotted during
the annual motion of the Earth35. The possible inﬂuence
of the dark matter on superconductors can in principle
be detected by precise and cleverly designed experiments
looking at the annual changes of their properties. We
rely here on the arguments presented in35, where the au-
thors analyze the annual modulations of the dark matter.
Our additional assumption is that dark matter is non-
homogeneously distributed in the neighborhood of the

Sun37 and these inhomogeneities will make a diﬀerence.
The gravity is a classical ﬁeld theory. It means that
there are no particles in it. The electromagnetism is de-
scribed by the Maxwell theory. In the same manner we
describe the dark matter as another classic ﬁeld, anal-
ogous to the electromagnetic one. The same model we
are using here as described in the previous section, has
been recently studied in the context of particle physics38.
These authors hope to observe the signatures of dark
matter in the “planned polarized electron scattering ex-
periments”. The hope is that polarized electrons in those
experiments will respond diﬀerently because of the dark
matter. In the same mood, we do hope that electrons in
superconductors will also ’feel’ the dark sector.

Another question is related to the possible condensa-

tion of the dark matter itself.
both matter and dark matter vortices has been recently
studied39, but the discussion of the results is outside the
scope of the present paper.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have discussed the general approach recently de-
veloped to study strongly coupled superconductors by
means of the theory of gravity. The main goal of our
study is to ﬁnd the inﬂuence of dark matter on the prop-
erties of superconductors. In the approach the signatures
of dark matter are visible as α dependence of various
properties of superconductors. In the probe limit, when
one neglects the back-reaction of the condensing ﬁeld on
the metric, the coupling strength α enters various pa-

rameters in a multiplicative way making it diﬃcult to
identify the presence of dark matter.

Combined with the evidence of dark matter in the in-
ner Milky Way, its non-homogeneous distribution around
the Sun provides a hope of dark matter detection in the
precise experiments with superconductors. Similarly to
the particle experiments aimed at the detection of dark
matter using the fact that “The count rate should expe-
rience an annual modulation due to the relative motion
of the Earth around the Sun”35 we also expect that the
properties of superconductor will show annual modula-
tion.

The application of the string theory to condensed mat-
ter problems is relatively recent endeavor. Despite that,
many novel results have been obtained. However, much
more has to be done. Let us ﬁnish with the following cau-
tionary statements. The ﬁeld of holographic supercon-
ductivity is a developing one and not all relevant ques-
tions have been asked and adequately answered. Simi-
larly, the concept of dark matter requires a lot of theo-
retical studies and observations before it will be properly
and completely understood. Our work15–19 is directed
towards better understanding of both: strongly coupled
superconductors and seemingly omnipresent, but still il-
lusory dark matter.
