ABSTRACT

Context. The extension of the corona of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) is under discussion. The standard model of magnetic conﬁg-
uration of CTTS predicts that coronal magnetic ﬂux tubes connect the stellar atmosphere to the inner region of the disk. However,
diﬀerential rotation may disrupt these long loops. The results from Hydrodynamic modeling of X-ray ﬂares observed in CTTS con-
ﬁrming the star-disk connection hypothesis are still controversial. Some authors suggest the presence of the accretion disk prevent
the stellar corona to extent beyond the co-rotation radius, while others simply are not conﬁdent with the methods used to derive loop
lengths.
Aims.We use independent procedures to determine the length of ﬂaring loops in stars of the Orion Nebula Cluster previously analyzed
using Hydrodynamic models. Our aim is to disentangle between the too scenarios proposed.
Methods. We present a diﬀerent approach to determine the length of ﬂaring loops based on the oscillatory nature of the loops after
strong ﬂares. We use wavelet tools to reveal oscillations during several ﬂares. The subsequent analysis of such oscillations is settle on
the Physics of coronal seismology.
Results. Our results likely conﬁrm the large extension of the corona of CTTS and the hypothesis of star-disk magnetic interaction in
at least three CTTS of the Orion Nebula Cluster.
Conclusions. Analyzing oscillations in ﬂaring events is a powerful tool to determine the physical characteristics of magnetic loops in
coronae in stars other than the Sun. The results presented in this work conﬁrm the star-disk magnetic connection in CTTS.

1. Introduction

Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and other young stellar objects
are characterized by accreting gas from a surrounding gaseous
disk. Accretion takes place through a funnel that connects the
star to the inner region of the disk (e.g. Hartman 1989). Koenigl
(1991) was the ﬁrst to propose the scenario of magnetic driven
accretion in CTTS. In such scenario, the star accretes material
from the disk following stellar magnetic ﬁeld lines connected
to the disk (see Figure 12 in Camenzind 1990). A similar sce-
nario was previously proposed for accreting neutron stars by
Ghosh & Lamb (1978).

Some mechanisms of this star-disk interaction are still
to be fully understood. Due to diﬀerential rotation between
the star and the disk, magnetic connection may be disrupted.
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations predict the poloidal
ﬁeld connecting the disk to the star is wrapped up when their
angular velocities diﬀer substantially (Lovelace et al. 1995). As
a consequence, magnetic loops inﬂate rapidly (Goodson et al.
1997). This expansion of poloidal ﬁeld yields a magnetic conﬁg-
uration with three components: a closed stellar magnetosphere, a
region of open ﬁeld connected to the pole of the star and a region
of open ﬁeld connected to the disk. According to Goodson et al.
(1997), reconnection of the open disk ﬁeld with the open stellar

ﬁeld is produced naturally. A byproduct of the star-disk interac-
tion is the occurrence of ﬂaring events in magnetic funnels.

Orlando et al. (2011) performed 3D MHD modeling of a
ﬂaring loop connected to a protoplanetary disk. The authors
showed that, in a time-scale of one hour after the energy is
released close to the disk, the magnetic tube is heated (T ∼
50 MK) and brightens in the soft X-rays. The plasma inside this
tube eﬃciently cools down in approximately one more hour. The
ﬂare perturbation propagates throughout the disk and after a few
hours, it triggers accretion from the opposite side of the disk
onto the star following other dipolar magnetic ﬁeld lines. This
accretion funnel reaches a quasi-equilibrium state (see Figure 6
in Orlando et al. 2011). Flaring in star-disk connected magnetic
tubes seems an eﬃcient process to trigger accretion in T Tauri
stars.

With a length L ∼ 1012 cm, the size of the hot-plasma tube
created after the ﬂare in the simulation by Orlando et al. (2011)
is comparable to that observed by Favata et al. (2005) in stars
of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP; Getman et al.
2005). Favata et al. (2005) found that some stars of their sam-
ple exhibited long ﬂaring loops (> 5 − 10 R⋆). Such loop
lengths were compatible with the scenario of star-disk magnetic
connection. Later, Getman et al. (2008a) determined lower val-
ues for the loop lengths of some of those stars. Getman et al.
(2008a) also compared loop lengths with co-rotation radii in the

COUP sample and obtained that X-ray coronal extent in fast-
rotating, diskless stars can signiﬁcantly exceed the Keplerian
co-rotation radius, whereas X-ray loop sizes in accreting sys-
tems do not exceed it (Getman et al. 2008b). They interpreted
this result as an evidence that the accretion disk truncates the
stellar magnetosphere. However, the apparent contradiction be-
tween Favata et al. (2005) and Getman et al. (2008a) in some
stars arises from the use of diﬀerent values for the slope of the
decay phase in the density-temperature diagram of each ﬂaring
event. This characteristic of the ﬂare is used later in both works
to determine the length of those loops following Reale et al.
(1997).

The main criticism given in the literature for using HD mod-
els to determine loop lengths is that the authors usually assume
the ﬂare occurs in a single loop instead of an arcade. Reale
(2007) showed that this assumption is reasonable during the ﬁrst
phases of the event. In that work, the author obtained a diagnos-
tic toolset to determine the loop length from characteristics of the
rise phase of the ﬂare. As this rise phase is typically very quick,
analyzing it uses to be diﬃcult due to the lack of photon statistics
(although see L´opez-Santiago et al. 2010). As an alternative to
HD modeling, other authors apply scaling laws to determine the
physical characteristics of stellar ﬂares (see G¨udel 2004, and ref-
erences therein). Typically, scaling laws predict short loops with
strong magnetic ﬁelds (∼ 1 KG) while single-loop HD models
predict longer loops with weak magnetic ﬁelds (∼ 100 G), for the
same ﬂare. An independent measure of the loop lengths would
help in deepening into this problem.

In recent years, oscillatory patterns have been detected
in solar ﬂares (e.g. Nakariakov et al. 1999; Aschwanden et al.
1999). These oscillations have been interpreted as fundamen-
tal modes of MHD oscillations in coronal magnetic loops (see
Stepanov et al. 2012, and references therein). A variety of os-
cillatory phenomena have been directly observed in solar ﬂar-
ing loops at diﬀerent wavelengths (e.g. Nakariakov & Ofman
2001; Srivastava et al. 2008; Nakariakov & Melnikov 2009;
Verwichte et al. 2009). Global waves traveling in the solar
corona have been also observed (see Liu & Ofman 2014, for
a review). Instead, very few oscillations have been detected in
ﬂares on other stars. Since the latter are spatially-unresolved,
one must look for indirect signatures in their light curve. As a
result, only oscillation modes causing changes in density inside
the magnetic loop can be detected in stars other than the Sun.

Mitra-Kraev et al. (2005) reported the ﬁrst detection in X-
rays of a loop oscillation in a star. The star was the young M
dwarf AT Mic and the oscillation was interpreted as a stand-
ing magneto-acoustic wave produced by a longitudinal, slow-
mode wave. The physical model was based on that proposed
by Zaitsev & Stepanov (1989): the ﬂaring loop oscillates due
to a centrifugal force caused by the ﬁlling in of the loop by
chromospheric material. Previously to Mitra-Kraev et al. (2005),
Mathioudakis et al. (2003) assumed the same model to study the
oscillation observed during the decay phase of a white-light ﬂare
observed in the U-band in the chromospherically active binary
II Peg. Mathioudakis et al. (2006) analyzed an optical oscilla-
tion observed in EQ Peg B, another M dwarf star. In that case,
the short oscillation observed in the U-band was interpreted as a
fast-MHD wave. In particular, the authors proposed the sausage
mode was responsible for the oscillation in the light curve. More
recently, Pandey & Srivastava (2009) found evidences of a fast-
kink mode in the X-ray oscillations detected in τ Boo, a G/K
binary system. However, kink modes do not cause changes in
density and they should not be detected in the light curve of ﬂar-
ing stars (see discussion in Stepanov et al. 2012).

2

In a study of UV light curves of M dwarfs, Welsh et al.
(2006) demonstrated that oscillations are frequent during stel-
lar ﬂares. However, these oscillations are eﬀectively damped by
thermal conduction (Ofman & Wang 2002; Selwa et al. 2005;
Jess et al. 2012). As a result, only a few periods (typically 3-4)
are observed. Numerical simulations of magneto-acoustic waves
in solar coronal loops show that the initial impulse mainly trig-
gers the fundamental mode and its ﬁrst harmonic (Selwa et al.
2005). Their study provides the longitudinal density stratiﬁca-
tion in the loop (Srivastava et al. 2013, and references therein).
We aim at analyzing oscillatory patterns in the young stars
of the Orion Nebula Cluster observed by the COUP, in order to
determine the properties of their ﬂaring loops, including loop
length. We will compare our results with those obtained by
Favata et al. (2005) and Getman et al. (2008a) using HD mod-
els. We notice that this method to determine loop lengths is very
robust since it is based only on basic Physics laws. We do not
make a priori assumptions on the aspect of the loop or any other
characteristic. If an oscillation is revealed in the light curve of a
star, it must come from a single loop as the ignition of diﬀerent
loops in an arcade is produced at distinct times. In other words,
the oscillation of diﬀerent loops in an arcade is not coherent and
if more than one loop oscillates even at the same frequency and
intensity, the signal of the distinct oscillations would cancel each
other and it would not be detected in the light curve of the star.
The light curves of the stars are analyzed using wavelet methods.

2. Wavelet analysis of the COUP sample

For our work, we used wavelet analysis tools to detect any
oscillation pattern. The wavelet analysis is a modiﬁed version
of the Fourier analysis adapted for detecting quasi-periodic
signals. The light curve is transformed from the time domain
into the frequency domain by convolving the original signal
with a mother function (a wavelet). In a Fourier transform,
the mother function is a combination of sines and cosines
that are inﬁnite in the time domain. As a result, by using
a Fourier transform, one cannot know the exact moment
the oscillation was triggered or whether it remained for a
long lapse of time or it was rapidly damped. Instead, using
particular mother functions, this kind of information can be
preserved. Following Torrence & Compo (1998), we used a
Morlet function as the wavelet, which has been previously
used with success to reveal oscillations during solar ﬂares
(e.g. Ofman et al. 2000; Banerjee et al. 2000; De Moortel et al.
2002; Verwichte et al. 2004; Srivastava et al. 2008) and stel-
lar ﬂares (e.g. Mitra-Kraev et al. 2005; Welsh et al. 2006;
Mathioudakis et al.
2013;
Pillitteri et al. 2014):
4 eiω0ηe− η2

2006; G´omez de Castro et al.

φ(η) = π− 1

where η is a non-dimensional time parameter and the non-
dimensional frequency (ω0) is set equal to 6 to approximately
satisfy the admissibility condition, i.e. the Morlet function with
ω0 = 6 integrates close to zero or, in other words, it permits a
reconstruction of the original signal.

The square of the wavelet transform of the signal is the
(wavelet) power spectrum and, for a time-dependent mother
function such as the Morlet one, it is two-dimensional (one di-
mension for frequency and one dimension for time). The peaks
showing a high conﬁdence level in this power spectrum are likely
related to oscillation patterns or any disturbance in the time se-
ries (e.g. a ﬂaring event). In particular, oscillation patterns main-

J. L´opez-Santiago et al.: Star-disk interaction in classical T Tauri stars revealed using wavelet analysis

tained in time are detected as an extended peak in the power
spectrum. To investigate the properties of these patterns, the light
curve can be reconstructed by ﬁltering the power spectrum at
those periods with high signiﬁcance (Torrence & Compo 1998).
For the case of a Morlet function, conﬁdence levels can be
derived bearing in mind that the power spectrum is χ2 distributed
(Ge 2007). In particular, for a given background spectrum Pk,
the power spectrum of the wavelet transform (Wn) satisﬁes the
condition:
|Wn|2
σ2 −→

Pkχ2
2

(2)

2

where σ2 is the variance of the signal in the time domain and
χ2
2 is the two dimensional χ2 distribution. Here, the −→ sym-
bol means “is distributed as”. |Wn|2 is the power spectrum of the
wavelet transform of the signal. We notice that, for general white
noise background, Pk = 1.

To determine conﬁdence levels for the features detected in
the wavelet power spectra, we assumed the background spec-
trum is red noise instead of white noise, which is typically
used in the literature. We note that the global shape of the ﬂare
must be subtracted to the the observed light curve ﬁrst to deter-
mine robust conﬁdence levels. We performed this subtraction by
smoothing the ﬂare light curves by a moving average and poly-
nomial ﬁtting.

Finally, the original time series can be reconstructed later by
ﬁltering the power spectrum at periods with high signiﬁcance
using either deconvolution or the inverse ﬁlter. Nevertheless, in
our work we follow (Torrence & Compo 1998) and reconstruct
the original light curve as the sum of the real part of the wavelet
over all the scales.

3. A simple model for the triggering of oscillations

during a ﬂare

Let we consider the oscillation is triggered by an increment in
the magnetic pressure that produces a change in the volume of
the magnetic tube. This scenario gives rise to sausage modes in
the perturbed plasma. By the conservation of linear momentum,
the force over a unit of volume in the tube is

F = J × B − ∇p

(3)

where J is the current density and p is the plasma pressure.

From the Amp`ere’s law applied to a plasma

J × B = −∇  B2

2µ0! + (B · ∇)B/µ0

Combining Eqs. 3 and 4,

F = −∇p − ∇  B2

2µ0! +

(B · ∇)B

(4)

(5)

The second term in Equation 5 describes the magnetic energy

density and acts as the magnetic pressure

pm =

2µ0

(6)

The third term in Equation 5 is the magnetic stress. If we
consider an unidirectional magnetic ﬁeld, ∇ · B = 0. Hence,
(B · ∇)B = 0 and, assuming static equilibrium, p = pm.

Let σ = Bmax/Bmin be the magnetic mirror ratio of the loop,
with Bmax the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the loop base and Bmin
the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the top of the loop (loop apex).
Assuming Bmax constant, ∆σ/σ = ∆Bmin/Bmin. Therefore, for
static equilibrium,

Here, ne and T are the plasma density and temperature, re-

As a result, for sausage-type oscillations, the magnetic ﬁeld
strength at the top of the loop can be inferred from the ampli-
tude of the oscillation, if the characteristics of the plasma are
previously determined from observations.

Alternative scenarios for the production of quasi-periodic
pulsations in ﬂares (slow magneto-acoustic modes, fast modes,
Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities, etc.) have been proposed in
the literature (see Nakariakov & Melnikov 2009, for a review).
Many of the discussed processes have negligible eﬀects on the
soft X-ray light curve. For example, Ofman & Sui (2006) sug-
gest that super-Alfv´enic beams in the vicinity of the reconnec-
tion region lead to the excitation of the oscillations through the
coupling of tearing mode and Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities.
However, they also note that the modulation is not observed
in thermal emission. In addition, fast magneto-acoustic modes
are highly dispersive and have typical periods quite shorter than
those observed in our sample.

4. Discussion of individual ﬂares

From the sample of COUP sources showing large ﬂares, we
selected those sources studied by Favata et al. (2005) and
Getman et al. (2008b) with the aim of comparing results. Each
source was studied independently because the behavior of the
ﬂare is diﬀerent in each star and, thus, the source and/or charac-
teristics of the oscillations can diﬀer. We focussed only on the
light curves with signiﬁcant oscillatory patterns. Figure 1 shows
the light curve observed for each star during the COUP observa-
tions. Time binning is 1 h.

In the following, we present results for individual sources
showing diﬀerent behaviors. A summary of the results compared
with those of Favata et al. (2005) and Getman et al. (2008a) is
shown in Table 1. For completeness, we compare the results ob-
tained assuming sausage-type oscillations (MHD scenario) with
those of acoustic waves (HD scenario). Details on this compari-
son are given for each star.

in this work.

4.1. COUP332

The source COUP 332 (2MASS J05350934-0521415) under-
went a long-duration ﬂare (> 300 ks) during the observations.
Favata et al. (2005) derived a peak temperature Tpeak = 113 MK
and a very low electronic density ne = 0.05 × 1010 cm−3.
Applying Reale et al. (1997), the authors determined a loop
length L ∼ 7 × 1012 cm. This value is considerably higher
than the one derived by Getman et al. (2008a), who obtained
L ∼ 0.15− 1.7× 1012 cm. Aarnio et al. (2010) suggest a star-disk
connection scenario in COUP 332, from the dust destruction ra-
dius estimated by them (see Table 1) and the loop length derived
by Favata et al. (2005).

The COUP observations are divided into periods of approx-
imately 100 to 160 ks interrupted by 50 ks gaps. Together with
the long duration of the ﬂare of COUP 332, this fact causes a gap
during the decay phase. We analyzed the ﬁrst part of the ﬂare,
consisting on the rise phase and the ﬁrst 50 ks of the decay, when
the oscillation should be triggered. Figure 2 shows the result of
the wavelet analysis. The top panel of the ﬁgure is the observed
light curve, with a moving average overplotted as a continuous
line. The bottom panel is the wavelet power spectrum after sub-
traction of the moving average to the observed light curve. The
hatched area in the bottom panel is the cone of inﬂuence (COI),
the region of the wavelet power spectrum in which edge eﬀects

tant (Torrence & Compo 1998). Top panel shows the observed

become important (Torrence & Compo 1998). For our work, we
analyze only features outside the COI.

A clear feature is detected during the rise phase (P ∼ 9 ks)
that evolves during more than 20 ks. The sound speed inside
the tube, for an adiabatic plasma with γ = 5/3, is cs = 1.16 ×
104 √T = 1.2 × 108 cm s−1. If we assume the oscillation with
period P = 9± 1 ks was caused by a wave moving along the tube
at the velocity of the sound and this is the fundamental mode,
the loop length would be L = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 1012 cm. This value
is in the range given by Getman et al. (2008a) and lower than
that given by Favata et al. (2005) who likely overestimated the
loop length. We notice that Favata et al. (2005) did not determine
uncertainties in the loop lengths and any comparison with our
results should be made with caution.

From the light curve reconstruction at the period of the os-
cillation (see Fig. 3), the intensity of the perturbation is ∆I/I =
0.17. From Eq. 10, the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the loop apex
is Bmin = 24 ± 3 G. This value is slightly higher than that given
by pressure equilibrium (B = 12 G; Favata et al. 2005). With
an Alv´en velocity ca ≈ 2.18 × 1011B/ √ne = 2.4 × 108 cm s−1,
the tube velocity for our plasma is ct = 1.1 × 108 cm s−1. For
an oscillation period P = 9 ± 1 ks, the loop length becomes
L = 0.98 ± 0.11 × 1012 cm, close to the length determined by as-
suming a wave moving at the velocity of the sound in the plasma.
Figure 3 also shows that the oscillation is damped. The qual-
ity factor of the oscillation is Q ≈ 20 and the e-folding time is
td = 60 ± 5 ks. Comparing results with Ofman & Wang (2002),
the damping of the oscillation does not seem to follow the scal-
ing laws derived for thermal conduction dissipation in the Sun.
The ratio td/P = 6.7 ± 1.9 is within the range obtained from

simulations by Selwa et al. (2005), where the authors considered
only energy leakage into the photosphere as the wave damping
mechanism.

4.2. COUP597(V2252Ori)

Figure 4 shows the wavelet power spectrum of the ﬂare detected
during the COUP in V2252 Ori. The power spectrum of the sub-
tracted light curve shows a signiﬁcant feature extended between
4 and 12 ks. Its shape resembles somewhat that of Prox Cen dur-
ing the ﬂare underwent in 2009 (Srivastava et al. 2013). In that
case, the authors identiﬁed two peaks in the power spectrum of
the light curve and considered the longer period as the funda-
mental mode and the shorter period as the ﬁrst harmonic. This
scenario may be correct also for the ﬂare observed in V2252 Ori.

Fig. 5. Light curve reconstruction of COUP 597 (V2252 Ori) at
periods P = 4.5 ks (continuous line) and P = 10 ks (dotted-
dashed line). Time binning of 300 s.

Figure 5 shows the reconstructed curve at periods P ∼ 4.5 ks
(dotted-dashed line) and P ∼ 10 ks (continuos line). The am-
plitude of the 4.5 ks feature is higher. According to Selwa et al.
(2005), if we assume this feature is the ﬁrst harmonic of the os-
cillation, the pulse of energy release should have occurred closer
to the loop foot than to its apex.

With the plasma parameters determined by Favata et al.
(2005, T peak = 87 MK and ne = 5.2 × 1010 cm−3), the sound
velocity inside the ﬂaring loop is cs = 1.16 × 104 √T = 1.1 ×
108 cm s−1 (assuming the plasma is adiabatic, with γ = 5/3).
If the oscillation was caused by an acoustic mode and we as-
sume the 10 ks feature is the fundamental mode of the oscil-
lation, L = 1.1 ± 0.2 × 1012 cm. If we consider the 4.5 ks is
the fundamental mode, L = 4.9 ± 0.5 × 1011 cm. Both values
of the loop length are close, but higher than that obtained by
Favata et al. (2005). According to Aarnio et al. (2010), this ﬂar-
ing loop is possibly anchored to the inner protoplanetary disk
(see Table 1).

As discussed in Section 3, for an optically thin plasma in
static equilibrium, the magnetic ﬁeld at the top of the loop can
be determined if the amplitude of the oscillation is known (see
Eq. 10). For our case, ∆I/I = 0.3 ± 0.1 and B = 162 ± 27 G.
This value is of the order of that determined from pressure
equilibrium (Favata et al. 2005). The Alfv´en velocity inside the
loop is ca =≈ 2.18 × 1011B/ √ne = 1.55 × 108 cm s−1 and
the tube velocity (the minimum velocity of the slow mode),
ct = 8.97 × 107 cm s−1. For this velocity, L = 4.0 ± 0.5 × 1011 cm
assuming the 4.5 ks feature is the actual fundamental mode,
L = 9.0 ± 0.9 × 1011 cm if we use the 10 ks (similar to the
value derived assuming acoustic waves).
The two oscillations detected are not very eﬃciently damped
(Q ≈ 25; see Figure 5). Contrarily to COUP 332, the damping
time of these oscillations τd ∼ 45 ks do follow the scaling law of
Ofman & Wang (2002) for low temperature plasma (T ∼ 6 MK).
Those laws were obtained for wave dissipation by thermal con-
duction.

4.3. COUP1246(V1530Ori)

V1530 Ori was included in Category 3 (“the inner edge of the
dust disk is clearly beyond reach of the magnetic ﬂaring loop”)
by Aarnio et al. (2010). Consequently, the ﬂaring loop cannot be
anchored to the accretion disk. Favata et al. (2005) determined a
loop length L = 4.0× 1011 cm (L/R⋆ = 3.4) and a magnetic ﬁeld

strength B = 240 G. The value for the loop length determined
by Getman et al. (2008a) is slightly smaller (L ∼ 2.4 × 1011 cm)
but still the loop is long (L/R⋆ ∼ 2).
The wavelet power spectrum of the ﬂare observed in
V1530 Ori (Figure 6) shows a feature outside the cone of in-
ﬂuence. Thus, we do not analyze it here. The feature at P ≈
1.8 ks is detected during the rise phase, close to the ﬂare maxi-
mum. From the peak temperature T = 270 MK determined by
Favata et al. (2005), the sound speed of the plasma inside the
magnetic tube is cs = 1.9 × 108 cm s−1. An acoustic wave would
travel 3.4 × 1011 cm in 1.8 ks. This value is close to the loop
length determined by Favata et al. (2005).
The reconstructed light curve for the period range 1.0 ks <
P < 2.0 ks is shown in Figure 7. The e-folding time of the oscil-
lation is 8.5 ± 1.0 ks. This value does not follow the scaling laws

for damping in solar ﬂares treated in Ofman & Wang (2002) and
Mariska (2005). In those works, damping was driven by ther-
mal conduction processes. The long decay time obtained in this
oscillation suggests the damping in this ﬂare was not caused
by thermal conduction but by leakage into the photosphere (see
Selwa et al. 2005).

The intensity of the oscillation is ∆I/I = 0.2 ± 0.04. From
Eq. 10, the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the loop apex is Bmin =
362 ± 45 G, considerably higher than the value derived from
pressure equilibrium (B = 240 G; Favata et al. 2005). With this
magnetic ﬁeld, the Alfv´en velocity inside the tube is cA = 3.3 ×
108 cm s−1 (assuming ne = 5.6 × 1010 cm−3; Favata et al. 2005),
for a tube velocity ct = 1.7 × 108 cm s−1. Using a period P =
1.8 ± 0.2 ks for the fundamental mode of oscillations, we derive
a length loop L = 3.4 ± 0.4 × 1011 cm, as for the case of an
acoustic wave.

4.4. COUP1456

During the COUP observations, this source showed a continu-
ous decrease in its count rate during more than 500 ks, likely
produced by the decay of a large ﬂaring event. This ﬂare was not
studied by Favata et al. (2005) or Getman et al. (2008a), most
likely because the ﬂare maximum took place before the observa-
tion started. In the wavelet power spectrum of the ﬁrst 90 ks of
the observation (Figure 8) the source shows a double peak fea-
ture at ∼ 6 ks. Before it, a peak at ∼ 3.0 ks is detected. The peak
at the highest frequency may be related to the ﬁrst harmonic of
the oscillation and the feature with the longest period to the fun-
damental mode. The detection of the ﬁrst harmonic before the
detection of the fundamental mode can be related to the location
of the initial pulse (energy input) in the loop (Selwa et al. 2005).
The ﬁrst harmonic is excited when the initial pulse is launched
close to the top of the loop. This harmonic is more sensitive to
the inhomogeneities of the medium and, hence, it is more ef-
ﬁciently damped. On contrast, the fundamental wave tends to
occupy the entire loop over its length and it is damped less eﬃ-
ciently.

We may assume the temperature at the beginning of the de-
cay phase is T = 20 − 40 MK taking the results of Getman et al.
(2008a) for other sources into account. For a 20 MK plasma, the
sound velocity in the medium is cs = 7.4 × 107 cm s−1. For the
fundamental wave (P = 6±0.5 ks) moving at the sound velocity,
L = 4.4± 0.4× 1011 cm, similar to other loop lengths determined
in previous sections for other ﬂaring loops.

4.5. COUP1608(OWOri)

Getman et al. (2008b) concluded that OW Ori is the only star
in the COUP sample where the ﬂare took place in a loop con-
necting the star with the disk. Actually, the authors assumed that
the disk of the stars in their sample were all truncated at the
stellar co-rotation radius. Aarnio et al. (2010) showed that this
assumption is wrong in some cases. Nevertheless, OW Ori re-
mains the most promising case to show a ﬂare in a star-disk
connected magnetic tube because the length derived in the lit-
erature by distinct authors is always above the co-rotation radius
(see Table 1). Getman et al. (2008a) determined a loop length of
∼ 8 × 1011 cm, similar to the value determined by Favata et al.
(2005). This length corresponds to 6.7 R⋆, which is longer than
the co-rotation radius. This result strongly suggests the energy
release occurred in a magnetic tube connecting the star with the
accretion disk.

Figure 9 shows the wavelet power spectrum of the ﬂare light
curve of OW Ori in the COUP. The global shape of the ﬂare
was subtracted from the light curve by smoothing the observed
curve with a moving average. The feature at P ≈ 10 ks is clearly
identiﬁed. It starts just before the ﬂare maximum. According to
the parameters determined in Favata et al. (2005) for this ﬂare,
ne = 1010 cm−3 and T peak = 258 MK. The sound velocity inside
the tube is, then, cs = 1.8 × 108 cm s−1. Assuming the feature at

P = 10 ks is the fundamental mode of an oscillation propagating
along the magnetic tube, L = 1.8 ± 0.2 × 1012 cm.
Favata et al. (2005) determined a magnetic ﬁeld strength B =
96 G assuming pressure equilibrium. From Eq. 10, B = 299±2 G
(∆I/I = 0.05 for this ﬂare). This value is quite higher than that
determined by Favata et al. (2005). Thus, then Alfv´en velocity
inside the tube is ca = 6.5 × 108 cm s−1 and the tube velocity
ct = 1.8×108 cm s−1. With this velocity, L = 1.8±0.2×1012 cm,
as for the sonic wave. This length is compatible with the star-disk
connection scenario.

5. Summary and Conclusions

We applied wavelet analysis tools to reveal oscillation patterns
in the ﬂare light curves of T Tauri stars observed by the COUP.
With the results obtained from this analysis and the plasma char-
acteristics previously determined, we inferred the length of the
ﬂaring loops. Our analysis is restricted to those ﬂares showing
a signiﬁcant oscillation. Other ﬂares were also studied but their
analysis gave uncertain results and they were not included here.
The limitations of our results are linked only to the uncertainties
in the plasma parameters taken from the literature. In particu-
lar, the plasma temperatures in Favata et al. (2005) are not well
constrained in some cases. We interpret oscillations as caused by
the fundamental mode and/or the ﬁrst harmonic inside the loop.
Higher order harmonics require higher energies to be released
(e.g. Selwa et al. 2005).

In our study, we did not assume the observed ﬂares occurs in
a single loop a priori. The wavelet analysis was applied to the
light curves of ﬂaring CTTS of the COUP. When an oscillation
pattern was revealed, we determined plasma properties including
the length of the oscillating structure. This value depends only
on the oscillation period and on the wave velocity. In the very
unlikely case of more than one loop oscillating in coherence (see
Section 1), all of them would oscillate at the same frequency and
the result would be applicable to each loop.

Assuming a simple physical model for triggering of an os-
cillation in a magnetic tube, other characteristics of the coro-
nal medium can be inferred. In this work, we determined mag-
netic ﬁeld strengths at the loop apex. Our results show that ﬂares
may take place in magnetic tubes connecting the star with its
accretion disk. In particular, we ﬁnd that at least three stars
(COUP 332, COUP 597 – or V2252 Ori – and COUP 1608 –
or OW Ori –) have magnetic tubes potentially connecting the
star with its accretion disk. According to MHD simulations by
Orlando et al. (2011), a ﬂare in a magnetic tube connecting the
star with the disk may trigger subsequent accretion by the star,
in time scales of hours to days after the ﬂare took place. In such
a case, UV enhance should be detected in these stars after some
hour after the ﬂare maximum. A simultaneous long X-ray and
UV observation of these stellar systems would eventually con-
ﬁrm this scenario.

We conclude that analyzing oscillations in ﬂare light curves
is a powerful tool to investigate the actual extension of the
corona of stars and determine other parameters. The particularly
case of classical T Tauri stars is a good check point.
