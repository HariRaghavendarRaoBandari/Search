ABSTRACT
We present far-infrared (FIR) 70 − 500 µm imaging observations obtained with Her-
schel/PACS and SPIRE of 33 nearby (median distance of 30 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies from
the Revised Shapley-Ames (RSA) catalogue. We obtain the FIR nuclear (r = 1 kpc
and r = 2 kpc) and integrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We estimate the
unresolved nuclear emission at 70 µm and we ﬁt the nuclear and integrated FIR SEDs
with a grey body model. We ﬁnd that the integrated FIR emission of the RSA Seyferts
in our sample is dominated by emission from the host galaxy, with dust properties
similar to those of normal galaxies (non AGN). We use four criteria to select galaxies
whose nuclear 70 µm emission has a signiﬁcant AGN contribution: (1) elevated 70/160
µm ﬂux ratios, (2)spatially resolved, high dust temperature gradient, (3) 70 µm excess
emission with respect to the ﬁt of the FIR SEDs with a grey body, and (4) excess of
nuclear SFR obtained from 70 µm over SFR from mid-infrared indicators. 16 galaxies
(48 per cent of the initial sample) satisfy at least one of these conditions, whereas 10
satisfy half or more. After careful examination of these, we select six bona ﬁde candi-
dates (18 per cent of the initial sample) and estimate that ∼ 40 − 70 per cent of their
nuclear (r = 1 − 2 kpc) 70 µm emission is contributed by dust heated by the AGN.

1 INTRODUCTION

Seyfert galaxies emit a large fraction of their bolometric
emission in the far-infrared (FIR) range (Rieke 1978). This
emission is due to dust grains that re-radiate the absorbed
optical and ultraviolet photons emitted by the active galac-
tic nucleus (AGN) as well as by stars in their host galax-

2 Garc´ıa-Gonz´alez et al.

ies. Rodr´ıguez Espinosa, Rudy, & Jones (1987) studied the
FIR emission of a sample of optically selected Seyfert galax-
ies using observations taken with the Infrared Astronomical
Satellite (IRAS). They found that the distribution of the
integrated FIR luminosities and 60 µm to 100 µm colours
of Seyfert and starburst galaxies were indistinguishable and
concluded that most of the FIR emission of Seyfert galax-
ies must be due to star formation processes. Using Infrared
Space Observatory (ISO) observations, P´erez Garc´ıa, Ro-
dr´ıguez Espinosa, & Santolaya Rey (1998) showed that the
integrated FIR thermal emission of Seyferts can be modelled
with a combination of three diﬀerent components: warm,
cold, and very cold dust. The warm component is due to dust
heated by the AGN and/or circumnuclear star formation
(T∼ 150 K), the cold component comes from dust heated by
stars in the disc of the galaxy (T∼ 40 − 50 K) and the very
cold component arises from dust heated by the general inter-
stellar radiation ﬁeld of the galaxy (T∼ 10−20 K). Spinoglio
et al. (2002) also found using ISO imaging data that the in-
tegrated FIR emission of Seyfert galaxies is dominated by
emission from the host galaxy.

Mushotzky et al. (2014) used FIR observations taken
with the Photodetector Array Camera (PACS; Poglitsch et
al. 2010) on board Herschel to study a sample of hard X-ray
selected galaxies from the 58 month Swift Burst Alert Tele-
scope (BAT) Active Galactic Nuclei catalogue. They found
that > 35 per cent and 20 per cent of the sources are point-
like at 70 and 160 µm, respectively. Using the same sample,
Mel´endez et al. (2014) showed that the integrated FIR lu-
minosity distributions of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies
are similar and their integrated fν (70µm)/fν (160µm) ratios
are indistinguishable from those of normal galaxies. Hatzimi-
naoglou et al. (2010) studied 469 spectroscopically conﬁrmed
AGN. They used the Spectral and Photometric Imaging RE-
ceiver (SPIRE; Griﬃn et al. 2010) data and showed that the
FIR emission of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies is identical
to that of star forming galaxies. The AGN contributes very
little to the integrated FIR emission and its contribution be-
comes important at wavelengths shorter than 70 µm, where
the torus starts playing an important role.

According to the uniﬁed model of AGN (Antonucci
1993), there is a dusty torus surrounding the accreting su-
permassive black hole. Dusty torus models where the dust
is distributed both homogeneously (e.g., Fritz, Franceschini,
& Hatziminaoglou 2006) or in a clumpy conﬁguration (see
e.g., Nenkova et al. 2008; H¨onig & Kishimoto 2010) predict
emission in the FIR, although the torus emission peaks in
the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range. Based on studies of
individual Seyfert galaxies using Herschel observations, the
contribution of the dust heated by the AGN to the total FIR
emission varies from galaxy to galaxy. For example, Alonso-
Herrero et al. (2012) found that in NGC 1365 the AGN
is the brightest source in the MIR but does not dominate
in the FIR. Using the Nenkova et al. (2008) torus models
they quantiﬁed the AGN emission at 70 µm and determined
that the AGN only contributes at most 1 per cent within
the central 5.4 kpc. For NGC 2992, Garc´ıa-Bernete et al.
(2015) showed that the AGN dominates the emission be-
tween 15 and 30 µm, but its contribution decreases rapidly
for wavelengths > 30 µm. Ramos Almeida et al. (2011) stud-
ied NGC 3081 and found that the FIR nuclear luminosity
within a radius of ≤ 0.85 kpc was well reproduced with the

Nenkova et al. (2008) clumpy torus models and concluded
that the AGN dominates the FIR nuclear luminosity of this
galaxy. There are however no statistical studies of the AGN
contribution in the FIR, so it is important to ﬁnd a method
to determine if the AGN dominates in the FIR for large
samples of galaxies. Mullaney et al. (2011) studied the in-
frared emission of a sample of local X-ray selected AGN
with little evidence of host galaxy contamination in their
MIR Spitzer/IRS spectra. They found that at least 3 of the
11 AGN in their sample are AGN dominated even at 60 µm.
In this work we study the FIR (70−500 µm) emission of
a sample of 33 nearby (median distance of 30 Mpc) Seyfert
galaxies drawn from the Revised Shapley-Ames catalogue
(RSA; Sandage & Tammann 1987) using Herschel imaging
observations taken with PACS and SPIRE. The main goal
is to disentangle the FIR emission of these Seyfert galax-
ies due to dust heated by the AGN from that due to dust
heated by star formation. In particular, we take advantage
of the Herschel angular resolution of 5.6 arcsec at 70 µm,
which provides a median physical resolution of 0.8 kpc for
our sample of galaxies. This allows us to study the nuclear
(radii of r = 1 kpc and r = 2 kpc) and integrated FIR emis-
sion of Seyfert galaxies. The paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we present our sample selection and the com-
parison with the entire RSA sample. In Section 3 we de-
scribe the data reduction and derive the aperture photom-
etry. Section 4 presents our results, such as the unresolved
70 µm emission, the FIR colours, the grey body ﬁtting and
the nuclear and extranuclear star formation rates (SFR).
In Section 5 we put forward a number of criteria to iden-
tify those Seyfert galaxies in our sample whose 70 µm emis-
sion is mostly due to dust heated by the AGN and discuss
the bona ﬁde candidates. The conclusions are presented in
Section 6. Throughout this work we use a cosmology with
H0 = 73 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.27 and ΩΛ = 0.73.

2 THE SAMPLE

We selected a sample of 33 nearby (distances DL < 70 Mpc,
Table 1) Seyfert galaxies (see Maiolino & Rieke 1995) from
the RSA catalogue (Sandage & Tammann 1987) with Her-
schel/PACS imaging observations in at least two bands and
SPIRE imaging observations from our own programs and
from the archive1 (see Table 3). We imposed the distance
criterion so we could obtain at least one nuclear (radii of
r = 1 kpc and/or r = 2 kpc) FIR measurement at 70 µm.
We also required Seyfert galaxies with existing high angular
resolution (0.3− 0.4 (cid:48)(cid:48)) MIR spectroscopy (H¨onig et al. 2010;
Gonz´alez-Mart´ın et al. 2013; Esquej et al. 2014; Alonso-
Herrero et al. 2016) obtained on 8 − 10 m class telescopes
(T-ReCS, CanariCam and VISIR instruments). We used
the spectra published in these references instead of reducing
the archival data. These observations allow us to determine
whether they have star formation activity on typical physical
scales of 50 − 60 pc, which is necessary when trying to de-
termine what galaxies in our sample have AGN-dominated
FIR emission. 23 of these galaxies also have estimates of the

nuclear and integrated SFR from mid-IR Spitzer/IRS spec-
troscopy taken from Diamond-Stanic & Rieke (2012) (here-
after DSR2012).

In Table 1 we list the properties of the Seyfert galax-
ies in our sample including their luminosity distance, optical
apparent magnitude (BT ), morphological type, and the op-
tical activity type (15 Sy 1 galaxies and 18 Sy 2 galaxies).
We consider as Sy 1 the 1.5 and 1.9 Seyfert galaxies.

We obtained the Spitzer/IRS SL+LL spectra from the
Cornell Atlas of Spitzer/IRS Sources version 7 (CASSIS,
Lebouteiller et al. 2011, 2015). The stitching of the diﬀer-
ent spectral orders has been made as described in Hern´an-
Caballero et al. (2016). We also provide in Table 1 the equiv-
alent width (EW) of the 6.2 and 11.3 µm PAH features mea-
sured from Spitzer/IRS short-low (SL) spectra, except for
NGC 1068 which was from a short-high (SH) spectrum (see
Esquej et al. 2014). We measured the EW of the PAH fea-
tures following the method described by Hern´an-Caballero
& Hatziminaoglou (2011). Finally, we give the AGN bolo-
metric luminosity, and the nuclear (r = 1 kpc) and extranu-
clear (r > 1 kpc) SFRs taken from DSR2012. For those RSA
Seyferts not in that work we take the AGN bolometric lumi-
nosities from Mason et al. (2012) and Esquej et al. (2014).

3 HERSCHEL OBSERVATIONS

FIR emission of Seyfert galaxies

5

Since the RSA sample is selected based on the galaxy optical
apparent magnitude, we used the BT values from Maiolino
& Rieke (1995) to determine if our galaxy selection is rep-
resentative of the entire RSA sample of Seyfert galaxies.
Their sample contains 91 relatively nearby Seyfert galax-
ies with BT <13.31 and have 30 galaxies in common with
our sample. The top left panel of Fig. 1 shows the BT dis-
tribution for the two samples. The 91 galaxies in Maiolino
& Rieke (1995) are shown in red and the 30 of 33 galaxies
in our sample are shown in blue. Inspection of Fig. 1 and
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test show that our sample is
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the RSA sample in terms of
BT (p-value= 0.92).

We also compared the luminosity distance of our sample
those of the 84 galaxies in DSR2012. They selected Seyfert
galaxies in the RSA sample with Spitzer/IRS observations
of the 11.3 µm PAH feature. We used, as DSR2012, the
luminosity distance obtained from the Nasa Extragalactic
Database (NED2) using the corrected redshift to the refer-
ence frame deﬁned by the Virgo cluster, the Great Attractor
and the Shapley supercluster. The right top panel of Fig. 1
shows the luminosity distance distributions for the 84 galax-
ies in DSR2012 and the 33 galaxies of our sample (median
luminosity distance of 30 Mpc). There are 10 Seyfert galax-
ies in our sample not in DSR2012 selection but in the RSA
catalogue. Again, from Fig. 1 and a K-S test (p=0.87) our
sample is not statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in terms of
the luminosity distance.

Since the main goal of this paper is to select galaxies
with evidence of strong contribution of the AGN at 70 µm
emission, in Section 4.4 we will compare the nuclear SFR
from MIR spectroscopy and Herschel 70 µm photometry.
We therefore compared the nuclear SFR values obtained by
DSR2012 for all their sample and the 23 galaxies in common
with our sample. The bottom left panel of Fig. 1 shows the
nuclear SFR distribution in DSR2012 and our sample with
DSR2012 SFR values (median of 0.32 M(cid:12)yr−1). A K-S test
shows that both samples are not statistically diﬀerent in
terms of the SFR (p = 0.42).

We ﬁnally compared the AGN bolometric luminosity
distributions for the galaxies in DSR2012 and our galaxies
with their values. This comparison is shown in the right bot-
tom panel of Fig. 1. Clearly, our sample only includes the
most luminous AGN Lbol > 1043 erg s−1 when compared to
the DSR2012 RSA sample. We ﬁnd a p value for the K-
S test of p = 0.03 when comparing with the galaxies in
common and p = 0.05 when comparing with all our sam-
ple. This is because in general low-luminosity AGN are not
bright in the mid-IR and thus few meet our requirement of
having high angular resolution MIR spectroscopy obtained
from the ground (see Alonso-Herrero et al. 2016). Even in the
mid-infrared the low-luminosity AGN do not dominate the
emission at least in the 40 per cent of the cases (Gonz´alez-
Mart´ın et al. 2015). Table 2 summarizes the statistics of the
above comparisons.

In this section we describe the process of obtaining the PACS
and SPIRE images from the Herschel archive, the data re-
duction and the aperture photometry.

The PACS instrument has three bands referred to as
blue, green, and red with central wavelengths of 70, 100,
and 160 µm, respectively. The nominal angular resolutions
are 5.6, 6.8, and 11.3 arcsec (FWHM). The red band can be
combined with the blue or the green band, for simultaneous
observations.

The SPIRE instrument has three bands centred at
250, 350, and 500 µm, with beam sizes of 18.1, 25.2, and
36.9 arcsec (FWHM), respectively. The three bands are ob-
served simultaneously.

3.1 Data reduction

We compiled all the PACS and SPIRE images for our 33
galaxies using the Herschel Science Data Archive (HSA)3.
First, we processed the raw level 1 data with the Herschel
interactive pipeline environment software (HIPE) version 13
(Ott 2010) to obtain the ﬂux calibrated timelines of each
bolometer. The standard HIPE pipeline corrects for instru-
mental eﬀects and attaches pointing information to the time-
lines. Then, we combined these timelines using Scanamor-
phos version 24 (Roussel 2013). Scanamorphos subtracts
low-frequency noise (thermal and non-thermal), masks high-
frequency glitches of the data, and projects the timelines into
a spatial grid. For the spatial grids, we selected a pixel size
of FWHM/4 for each band. These values provide a good
compromise between angular resolution and sampling (> 10
samples per pixel). We discarded mosaics at 100 µm where
the galaxy reaches the edge of the image only in these band
because we could not obtain reliable measurements of the
background and could not obtain the integrated ﬂux in the
same aperture as the other bands. Only 22 of the 33 galaxies
(67 per cent of the sample) have observations at 100 µm af-
ter discarding these images. The list of all the observations
used can be found in Table 3. Fig. 2 shows an example of the
mosaics of one galaxy in our sample observed in all PACS
and SPIRE bands. The mosaics for the rest of the sample
are available online. The number of images used for each
band is given in Table 4.

3.2 Aperture photometry

Circular aperture photometry of the galaxies was carried out
using HIPE version 13. For every galaxy and every band we
performed the photometry for radii of 1 kpc, and 2 kpc, as
well as for the total galaxy. To determine the size in arcsec
corresponding to 1 kpc and 2 kpc we took into account the
luminosity distance of each galaxy. The aperture correspond-
ing to the total galaxy was determined by visual inspection
of the radial proﬁles in all the bands. In Table 7 we list
the apertures used for the total photometry. We imposed
that the aperture had to be the same for all the bands. In
some galaxies, part of the galaxy seen in the SPIRE bands
is outside the aperture used for the photometry. To avoid

errors in the photometry due to the small size of the aper-
ture, we only consider ﬂuxes from nuclear apertures with
a diameter higher than 1.5 times the angular resolution of
each band. The photometric error of each image is deter-
mined by placing six apertures on the background around
the source and measuring the standard deviation per pixel of
the background within these apertures. The error in the ﬂux

was then computed by multiplying the standard deviation
per pixel by the number of pixels of the aperture.

six Herschel bands. We then applied an aperture correction
using HIPE to the ﬂuxes of those galaxies that are point
sources and quasi point sources. We did not apply an aper-
ture correction to the extended sources. We consider that a
source is quasi point-like at one particular band (although
it may have extended emission) when the measured FWHM
(see Table 4) is less than the FWHM of the instrument plus
the number of arcseconds in one pixel. For a typical galaxy
in our sample at 30 Mpc, the aperture correction at 70 µm
is 1.48 and 1.22 for photometry radio of 1 and 2 kpc, respec-
tively. For sources that are quasi point-like the unresolved
ﬂuxes are probably slightly overestimated, as we shall see
in Section 4.1. This is due to the instrumental Point Spread
Function (PSF) that causes that a fraction of the external
emission of the aperture to be observed in the inner region.
However, although this correction cannot be calculated, it
should be within the ﬂux error and it does not modify our
results.

To obtain the ﬁnal error of the ﬂuxes we added in
quadrature the photometric calibration uncertainties (10 per
cent) to the error calculated above. In Tables 5, 6 and 7 we
provide the ﬂuxes for all galaxies and all bands for r = 1 kpc,
r = 2 kpc, and the total galaxy. We also list, for every
galaxy, the size in arcsec for the aperture used. As can be
seen from this table, the photometric calibration uncertainty
dominates in most cases.

4 RESULTS

In this Section we analyse the FIR properties of our sample,
such as, the unresolved 70 µm emission, the FIR colour dis-
tributions, the results from ﬁtting the data to a grey body
and the SFR nuclear and extranuclear obtained from the 70
µm data.

Research in Astronomy (AURA), Ibc., under cooperative agree-
ment with the National Science Foundation.

4.1 Unresolved 70 µm emission

Of the 33 galaxies in our sample, 12 nuclei (31 per cent)
appear point-like at 70 µm, i.e., have FWHM < 6 arcsec (see
Table 4). As can be seen from Fig. 3, the 70 µm emission for
those nuclei seen as point sources originates in regions with
sizes (diameters) of less than ∼ 0.5 − 2 kpc, with a median
size of 1.3 kpc. These values are, however, comparable to
those nuclei in our sample that appear clearly extended at
70 µm (median size of 1.0 kpc). The fraction of RSA Seyfert
galaxies with unresolved emission is similar to that of the
Swift/BAT hard X-ray selected AGN sample of Mushotzky
et al. (2014). They found that >35 per cent of their sources
are point-like at 70 µm with typical sizes at 70 µm of 2 kpc.
However, the Swift/BAT AGN sample is on average at z ∼
0.025, compared to the average z = 0.007 of our sample.
Therefore, it is likely that the diﬀerence in redshifts between
our sample and the Swift/BAT sample explains the diﬀerent
physical sizes for the 70µm emitting nuclear region.

To study further the unresolved 70 µm emission we es-
timated the contribution of the nuclear region to the total
ﬂux at 70 µm, as is shown in Fig. 4. The median values of
the nuclear contributions to the total ﬂux are 0.68 and 0.86
for r = 1 kpc and r = 2 kpc, respectively (see Table 8).

Of the 27 galaxies with measurements of the nuclear
ﬂux in r = 1 kpc at 70 µm, 20 (74 per cent) have a nuclear 1
kpc contribution to the total ﬂux greater than 50 per cent.
Of the 33 galaxies with nuclear ﬂuxes within r = 2 kpc at
70 µm, 28 (85 per cent) have a nuclear r = 2 kpc contribu-
tion greater than 50 per cent. The values obtained for 1 kpc
and 2 kpc are similar because 88 per cent of the galaxies re-
quired an aperture correction for the ﬂuxes. Our results are
in agreement with Mushotzky et al. (2014). They found that
92.5 per cent (274 out of 296 galaxies) of their sample had
a point source contribution greater than 50 per cent of the
total ﬂux at 70 µm. They found a slightly higher percentage
because they performed the photometry with an aperture
of 6 arcsec for the PACS 70 µm images for all the galaxies,
independently of their distance. As their galaxies are more
distant than our sample, then the regions for their nuclear
photometry are larger than our r = 1 kpc and r = 2 kpc

performed an aperture correction to the ﬂuxes.

4.2 FIR colours

We ﬁrst start by discussing the fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux
ratio since we can still obtain nuclear values for a signiﬁcant
fraction of galaxies in our sample. It provides information
about the peak of the galaxy spectral energy distribution
(SED) and is a proxy for the dust temperature (Skibba et
al. 2011; Mel´endez et al. 2014). Figure 5 shows the distribu-
tions of this ratio for r = 1 kpc and r = 2 kpc, and for the
entire galaxy. As can be seen from this ﬁgure (see Table 9
for the statistical information), the ﬂux ratios for the nu-
clear regions tend to be higher than those measured for the
entire galaxies. This is in good agreement with the decreas-
ing fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratios with galactocentric
radius found for M81 and M83 (Bendo et al. 2012). These
authors suggested that this ratio tends to be more strongly
inﬂuenced by star forming regions than other FIR ratios

galaxies, dash-dot black line) for the RSA Seyferts.

involving longer wavelengths. Therefore, the higher nuclear
ratios in our sample could be due to higher star formation
activity but also to higher dust temperature due to AGN
heating (see further discussion in Section 5).

For the Swift/BAT AGN sample, Mel´endez et al. (2014)
measured a mean integrated fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ra-
tio of 0.81± 0.43 for Seyfert 1s and 0.77± 0.47 for Seyfert 2s.

These are fundamentally the same as for our sample of op-
tically selected AGN. Mel´endez et al. (2014) also compared
their observed colours with predictions from three diﬀerent
torus models and found that the torus models cannot pro-
duce fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ratios of less than unity. This
suggests that the 70 µm and 160 µm integrated emission is
dominated by the host galaxy.

Mel´endez et al. (2014) also compared the Swift/BAT
AGN FIR colour distribution with the Key Insights on
Nearby Galaxies: a Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel
(KINGFISH) sample of nearby galaxies (Dale et al. 2012).
For this comparison, they only selected the normal galaxies
in the KINGFISH sample using the spectral classiﬁcation of
Moustakas et al. (2010), and demonstrated that the BAT
AGN FIR colours are statistically indistinguishable from
those of normal galaxies. As our colour distribution for the
total galaxies is compatible with the BAT AGN colour dis-
tribution, the colours of our galaxies are not statistically dif-
ferent from those of normal galaxies (p = 0.20) comparing
our galaxies with normal galaxies in the KINGFISH sample
(see also Table 9).

Shimizu et al. (2015) also studied the BAT sample
and found anomalous colours for 6 BAT AGN with fν (250
µm)/fν (350 µm) < 1.5 and fν (350 µm)/fν (500 µm) < 1.5.
They suggested that this might be an excess based on the
synchrotron emission from the jet or the corona from the
accretion disks. We do not ﬁnd these anomalous colours for
our galaxies.

We also compare the other integrated FIR colours of
our galaxies with the KINGFISH sample of Dale et al.
(2012) (including normal galaxies and AGN) and with the
85 nearby (z(cid:54)0.5) quasars from the Palomar-Green (PG)
sample of Petric et al. (2015). In Fig. 6 we show the
fν (100 µm)/fν (500 µm) vs. fν (70 µm)/fν (250 µm) colour-
color diagram (left) and fν (250 µm)/fν (500 µm) vs. fν (70
µm)/fν (160 µm) colour-colour diagram (right) for our galax-
ies, the KINGFISH sample and the PG quasar sample. Most
of the PG quasars only have upper limits of the ﬂuxes for
some bands. There are 65 quasars with upper limits at 500
µm, 29 at 250 µm, 16 at 160 µm, 4 at 100 µm and 2 at 70

µm. We do not display quasars with upper limits in the two
ﬂuxes involved in a ratio. In the left panel of Fig. 6 we show
81 quasars of the PG sample and in the right panel we show
54 quasars. We indicate with grey arrows the quasars with
upper limits.

From Fig. 6, we observe that the fν (250 µm)/fν (500
µm) and fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ratios of the RSA Seyfert
galaxies (7.26 ± 1.21 and 0.78 ± 0.30, respectively) are,
on average, higher than those of the KINGFISH sample
(4.96 ± 1.73 and 0.63 ± 0.39, respectively). A K-S test in-
dicates that the distributions of the two ﬂux ratios are sta-
tistically diﬀerent for our sample and the KINGFISH sam-
ple. We obtain p-values of p = 0.002 and p = 10−7 for the
fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) and fν (250 µm)/fν (500 µm) ratios,
which indicates that they are statistically drawn from diﬀer-
ent parent samples. This may be due to the large range of
morphologies and metallicities of the KINGFISH galaxies,
whereas the RSA Seyfert galaxies are mostly early type (see
Table 1). The diﬀerences in the integrated fν (70 µm)/fν (160
µm) ﬂux ratios are not in conﬂict with the comparison be-
tween the BAT AGN sample and the KINGFISH sample.
Mel´endez et al. (2014) compared their galaxies with the
normal galaxies in the KINGFISH sample. A K-S test in-
dicates that fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ratios of Mel´endez et
al. (2014) and all the KINGFISH sample are statistically
diﬀerent (p = 0.003).

4.3 Grey-body ﬁtting

In this section we estimate the dust temperature by ﬁtting
the Herschel SED to a grey body. We use sherpa (Doe et
al. 2007), that is, the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Ob-
servations (CIAO’s) modelling and ﬁtting package (Freeman,
Doe & Siemiginowska 2001) module for python. We ﬁt νFν
versus the rest-frame wavelength, using the following expres-
sion:

νFνmodel =

A
λkT − 1)
hc

c
λ

λ3+β(e

(1)

where λ is the rest-frame wavelength, and the free parame-
ters of the ﬁtting are the amplitude (A), the dust tempera-
ture (T ), and the dust emissivity index (β). To estimate the
best ﬁt to the data we ﬁrst minimized the usual χ2 statistics
leaving all the parameters to vary freely:

N(cid:88)

χ2 =

(νFνi − νFνi,model )2

i

σ2
i

(2)

where N is the number of data points, Fνi is the ﬂux at the
ith wavelength, σi is the uncertainty of the observed ﬂux at
the ith wavelength, and Fνi,model is the predicted Fν for the
ith wavelength. We perform the ﬁts for the integrated SEDs
as well as for the nuclear r = 1 kpc and r = 2 kpc SEDs. We
require four or more data points for the ﬁttings.

Figure 7 shows a few examples of the best-ﬁts to the
SEDs for r = 1 kpc, r = 2 kpc, and the total galaxy. In the
rest of the galaxies in the sample can be found in the on-
line version. The values of the best-ﬁt β and T parameters
are listed in Table 10. Figure 8 shows the β distribution for
each galaxy for r = 1 kpc, r = 2 kpc, and the total galaxy.

Figure 6. Colour-colour diagrams for our RSA Seyfert galaxies (blue stars), the normal galaxies from the KINGFISH sample (red circles)
of Dale et al. (2012), the AGN galaxies from the KINGFISH sample (coral circles) and the PG quasar sample (green crosses) of Petric
et al. (2015). The grey arrows are quasars with an upper limit to the ﬂux. The solid lines indicate the models from Dale & Helou (2002).
These models of SEDs are derived from the average global trends for a sample of normal star-forming galaxies.

Figure 7. Examples of best ﬁts to the FIR SEDs of the galaxies with a grey body with all the parameters left free to vary. The red
circles are the ﬂuxes for r = 1 kpc, the cyan triangles for r = 2 kpc and black stars for the total galaxy. The lines indicate the best ﬁt in
each region (only if there are 4 or more data points), with the colours as for the data points. The best ﬁts for the rest of the galaxies
can be found in the online version.

In Fig. 9 we show, for each galaxy, the dust temperature ob-
tained in the ﬁtting of the diﬀerent regions (1 kpc, 2 kpc, the
total galaxy). In Table 11 we provide the statistical informa-
tion corresponding to Figs. 8 and 9. We show in parenthesis
the total values for those 14 galaxies in our sample with SED
ﬁts within r = 2 kpc so we can compare the results for these
galaxies in 2 kpc and the total galaxy.

For galaxies with SED ﬁts in the three physical regions,
we ﬁnd that the nuclear regions with r = 1 kpc have the
highest temperatures in agreement with the spatially re-
solved maps of the dust temperatures of S´anchez-Portal et
al. (2013) for a few nearby Seyfert galaxies. The values ob-
tained for the dust emissivity indices and temperatures for
the integrated values are 1.0 < β < 2.0 and 21 < T < 38 K.
These values of temperatures are in agreement with those
obtained by Dale et al. (2012) (18 < T < 40 K) from ﬁts
to the 100 − 500 µm SEDs of KINGFISH galaxies. Our β
values are also in agreement with the ones of Dale et al.
(2012) (1.2 < β < 1.9). P´erez Garc´ıa, Rodr´ıguez Espinosa,
& Santolaya Rey (1998) studied 10 Seyfert galaxies observed
with ISO and obtained that the MIR to FIR SEDs can be

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2015)

reproduced with three diﬀerent components: warm, cold and
very cold dust. Our temperature range is between the very
cold component (T∼ 10 − 20 K) and the cold component
(T∼ 40 − 50 K), so it may be due to dust heated by stars
in the disc (cold component) and by the general interstellar
radiation ﬁeld of the galaxy (very cold component).

For some galaxies (e.g., NGC 3081, NGC 3783, and
NGC 5347) the ﬁt to the integrated SED does not reproduce
well the 70 µm data point. We also tried ﬁts to the integrated
SEDs without this data point and found that for the major-
ity of galaxies the reduced χ2 values are higher with 70 µm
data than without it. This suggests that in some galaxies
this excess of 70 µm emission requires another component
with a higher dust temperature, which could be associated
with dust heated by the AGN. We will come back to this
issue in Section 5.

To quantify the 70 µm excess in the integrated SED
from the single temperature ﬁts, we performed new grey
body ﬁts imposing β=2, which is the typical value for star
forming galaxies (Li & Draine 2001). The statistical infor-
mation about the ﬁtted values of the dust temperature for

For each galaxy, which is labelled on the horizontal axis with the
number given in Table 1, we show β for r = 1 kpc (4 galaxies,
red circles), r = 2 kpc (15 galaxies, cyan triangles), and the total
galaxy (33 galaxies, black stars). The horizontal lines indicate the
median values, red for r = 1 kpc, dashed cyan line for r = 2 kpc
and the dash-dot black line for the total galaxy.

Figure 9. Dust temperature obtained through the grey body
ﬁtting for each galaxy labelled according to Table 1. We give
the ﬁtted temperature if available for r = 1 kpc (4 galaxies, red

galaxy (33 galaxies, black stars). The horizontal lines indicate the
median values for r = 1 kpc (solid red line), r = 2 kpc (dashed
cyan line) and total galaxy (dash-dot black line).

β = 2 are listed in Table 11. The range of dust temperatures
obtained with the ﬁt imposing β=2 is 18 − 31 K, which are
the normal temperatures for star forming galaxies. As ex-
pected, since β and T are anticorrelated (see e.g. Galametz
et al. 2012, and also Figs. 8 and 9), for a given galaxy the
ﬁts with ﬁxed dust emissivity β = 2 produce lower dust
temperatures.

In Fig. 10 we show 4 RSA Seyfert galaxies with inte-
grated SED ﬁts with ﬁxed dust emissivity β = 2 showing
the highest excesses at 70 µm over the single temperature

ﬁts, which puts them clearly above the 1σ uncertainty of
their ﬁts. The data are shown in black, and the best ﬁt with
β=2 is shown in blue. The red lines indicate the best ﬁt ±1σ
of the free parameters. The results for these ﬁts for the rest
of the sample are in the online version.

fν (model)

70 µm excess of the sample are 26 per cent and 16 per cent,
respectively, although some galaxies have high excesses, such
as NGC 4051 (170 per cent excess) and NGC 4725 (114 per
cent excess). In Fig. 11 we show the 70 µm excess distri-
bution. We note that all the sources have a positive excess.
These 70 µm excesses might be due to a hotter dust com-
ponent not necessarily related to dust heated by an AGN
(Galametz et al. 2012; Alonso-Herrero et al. 2012). We will
discuss this further in Section 5.

4.4 Star Formation Rates

In this subsection we calculate the nuclear and extranuclear
SFR using the 70 µm luminosity and compare them with the
SFR obtained with other indicators. The goal is to identify
galaxies where there is excess emission at 70 µm due to the
AGN. We use the recipe from Li et al. (2013), which assumes
a Kroupa (2001) IMF:

SF R(70 µm)(M(cid:12) yr

−1) = C70 µm,region × 10
×L(70 µm)(erg s

−43
−1)

(3)

The calibration coeﬃcient C70 µm,region is diﬀerent de-
pending on the region of the galaxy. To calculate the
SFR we used the coeﬃcients from Calzetti et al. (2010)
and Li et al. (2010), which are C70 µm,galaxy = 0.58 and

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2015)

versus the 11.3 µm PAH SFR (r = 1 kpc) from DSR2012. Red cir-
cles are the 70 µm-based SFR calculated with C70µm,0.5−2kpc =
0.94 (regions 0.5 − 2 kpc in size), whereas the blue triangles are
SFR obtained with C70µm,galaxy = 0.58 (entire galaxy). The
black line indicates the 1:1 relation. The 70 µm nuclear SFR un-
certainties are derived by propagation of errors in the SFR for-
mula, using the ﬂux errors given in Tables 5, 6 and 7. The black
symbols show the ﬁnal selected Seyferts with signiﬁcant nuclear
70 µm AGN emission (see Section 5.6). We note that there are
two symbols for each galaxy, one for each coeﬃcient.

C70 µm,0.5−2 kpc = 0.94, respectively. The Calzetti et al.
(2010) coeﬃcient was derived from the integrated emission
of galaxies and includes contributions from the diﬀuse com-
ponent at 70 µm whereas the Li et al. (2010) measurements
are local (star forming regions on scales of 0.5 − 2 kpc) and
minimize the contribution of any diﬀuse component.

Figures 12 and 13 compare the values for the SFR ob-
tained by DSR2012 with our 70 µm-based SFRs for the nu-
clear (r = 1 kpc) and extranuclear (r > 1 kpc) regions, re-
spectively. We have 20 galaxies in common with DSR2012
with nuclear SFR values and 14 galaxies in common with
the DSR2012 extranuclear SFR values. They obtained their
nuclear SFR values from the luminosity of the 11.3 µm PAH
feature and the extranuclear SFR from the luminosity of
the extended 24 µm continuum emission after subtracting
the contribution from the nuclear source. For the nuclear
SFRs our values derived with the C70 µm,galaxy coeﬃcient
for the whole galaxy are on average four times higher than

µm extranuclear SFR uncertainties are calculated by propaga-
tion of errors in the SFR formula, using the ﬂux errors given in
Tables 5, 6 and 7.

those of DSR2012, and even a factor of 7 if we used the co-
eﬃcient for 0.5 − 2 kpc regions. These diﬀerences are larger
than the quoted scatter of 0.14dex of the Li et al. (2010)
calibration with some galaxies showing large discrepancies.
For instance, NGC 3783 has a nuclear 70 µm based SFR 13.6
times higher than the nuclear 11.3 µm PAH based SFR. For
the extranuclear SFRs, the majority of the galaxies in our
sample have higher SFRs using the 70 µm emission than the
DSR2012 value, although the galaxies appear to be closer to
the 1:1 line.

The discrepancies in SFRs found for the RSA Seyferts
are similar to those for the Swift/BAT AGN of Mushotzky et
al. (2014). They calculated the total SFR using the Calzetti
et al. (2010) 70 µm calibration, that is for the entire galaxy,
and compared them with the SFR obtained from the 11.3 µm
PAH feature using the calibration from DSR2012. They ob-
tained a discrepancy of a factor of 3 between the two SFR.
Petric et al. (2015) also found that the integrated galaxy
SFRs of a sample of PG quasars obtained from the 11.3 µm
PAH feature were on average 3 times lower than the SFR
estimated from the 40 − 500 µm emission.

All the diﬀerences in SFR described above could be ex-
plained if the carriers of the 11.3 µm PAH feature were being
destroyed by the AGN radiation ﬁeld, if there were aper-
ture correction issues and/or if there were systematics in
the calibrations. DSR2012 argued that SFR estimates using
the 11.3 µm PAH feature appear to be robust to the eﬀects
of AGN and shock processing based on the good correla-
tion with the [Ne ii]12.8 µm line on kpc scales. Additionally
Esquej et al. (2014) showed that even on smaller physical
nuclear scales of nearby Seyferts there is no strong evidence
for destruction of the 11.3 µm PAH carriers. The SFR dif-
ferences do not seem to be due to the aperture corrections
applied because all three works (DSR2012, Mushotzky et al.
2014 and Petric et al. 2015) also applied aperture corrections
to their ﬂuxes.

5 IDENTIFYING GALAXIES WITH

SIGNIFICANT 70 µM EMISSION DUE TO
AGN HEATED DUST

As the goal of this work is to select galaxies whose 70 µm
emission is mostly due to dust heated by the AGN, in this
section we put forward four diﬀerent criteria to identify this
type of galaxies. We also compare them with other results
in the literature and propose candidate RSA galaxies with
signiﬁcant nuclear 70 µm AGN emission.

5.1 Elevated fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratios

If the fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratios are higher than the
typical values for star forming galaxies, this might indi-
cate that part of the nuclear 70 µm emission is due to
the dust heated by the AGN instead of star formation. To
select the galaxies with an elevated fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm)
ﬂux ratio we choose all the galaxies with a value higher
than the median plus 1.4826 × M.A.D, where the M.A.D
(absolute median deviation) is calculated as the median of
the absolute deviations from the data median, M.A.D. =
median(|xi − mediandata|). We do this for the r = 1 kpc,
r = 2 kpc, and integrated ﬂux ratios using the statistics in
Table 9, each one with its own value.

We select 9 galaxies with this criterion (see Table 12).
We note that the 2 galaxies with high fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm)
ﬂux ratios within r = 1 kpc also show it within r = 2 kpc.
All the galaxies with a high ﬂux ratio within r = 2 kpc
have high ﬂux ratio at r = 1 kpc or have no measurements
within 1 kpc. The same happens with the total ﬂux ratio,
galaxies with high total ﬂux ratio have also high 2 kpc ﬂux
ratio or have no measurement at 2 kpc. However, not all
galaxies with a high nuclear ﬂux ratio have also high total
ﬂux ratio. Only NGC 5506 is selected from the ﬂux ratios
within r = 2 kpc and with the total galaxy ﬂux. The rest
have extended diﬀuse emission at 160 µm and therefore their
measured integrated ﬂux is higher at 160 µm than at 70 µm
(see Fig. 2 and Table 7).

the
fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratio and the EW of
the
6.2 and 11.3 µm PAH features measured from Spitzer/IRS
spectra. The emission from these features is an indicator
of the presence of on-going/recent star formation activity
(Peeters et al. 2004) but can be diluted by the AGN contin-
uum, resulting in lower EW (Spoon et al. 2007; D´ıaz-Santos
et al. 2010; Hern´an-Caballero & Hatziminaoglou 2011;
Esquej et al. 2014). Note that not all the galaxies in our
sample have a value of the EW (see Table 1). There is one
galaxy that satisﬁes the criterion for r = 2 kpc without EW
data.

the

relation

As expected, those galaxies with a high value of the
fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) have a small value of the EW of the
PAH features, indicating that it is a good criterion to se-
lect galaxies with the dust heated by the AGN. We note
that the size of the IRS SL slit is similar to the FWHM at
70 µm. The only discrepant galaxy is the Seyfert 2 galaxy
Mrk 1066, which has a high total fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux
ratio, but also a high value of the EW of the PAHs. Alonso-
Herrero et al. (2014) and Ramos Almeida et al. (2014) have
shown, based on high angular resolution (0.3arcsec) MIR
spectroscopy, that this galaxy has a strong nuclear starburst

The dashed black line indicates the median of each sample and the green line the median plus 1.4826 × M.A.D. The black symbols show

including the central ∼ 60 pc region. This would explain the
elevated FIR colours of this galaxy. However, as can be seen
from Fig. 14, not all galaxies with low PAH EWs features
satisfy this criterion. Since the PAH features probe mostly
the emission from O and B stars (Peeters et al. 2004), it is
possible that some galaxies in our sample have most of their
FIR emission mainly due to heating from older stars (see
e.g. Li et al. 2010) explaining why they do not have bright
PAH emission but still have normal FIR colours. Alterna-
tively for these galaxies the torus emission might dominate
in the MIR but it decays rapidly in the FIR (see Mullaney
et al. 2011).

5.2 Dust temperature gradient higher than

typical star forming galaxies

If the nuclear dust temperature is higher than those typical
of star forming galaxies, this may indicate that the nuclear
dust is not only heated by star forming but also by the AGN.
However, because star-forming galaxies show a range of dust
temperatures (Dale et al. 2012), for a given galaxy we com-
pare the nuclear (r = 1 kpc and r = 2 kpc) temperatures to
the dust temperature ﬁtted for entire galaxy.

To select the galaxies with an elevated dust tempera-
ture gradient we use as criterion the ratio between the nu-
clear temperature and the total temperature for each galaxy.
We select all the galaxies with a value higher than the me-
dian plus 1.4826 × M.A.D for our sample of galaxies. For
this criterion we can use 15 galaxies, which are the galaxies
with at least four data points to ﬁt the r = 2 kpc SEDs.
These 15 galaxies have similar mean integrated dust tem-
peratures to those of the other RSA Seyfers (see Table 11).
With this criterion we select 3 galaxies with higher dust tem-
perature gradient than the typical in our sample. These are
NGC 4579, NGC 4594, and NGC 4725.

5.3 Excess 70 µm emission with respect to the ﬁt

of the FIR SEDs with a grey body

The 70 µm excess with respect to the ﬁt of the FIR SEDs
with a grey body with β=2 could in principle indicate that
this emission is not only due to star formation but that there
is some contribution from the AGN. We select those galaxies
whose excess at 70 µm is higher than the median plus 1.4826
× M.A.D for our sample of galaxies (28 per cent).

Figure 15 plots the 70 µm excess against the EW of
the 6.2 and 11.3 µm PAH features as measured from the
Spitzer/IRS spectra. Since those galaxies with a considerable
excess also have small values of EW for both features, it is
likely that this criterion selects galaxies with a contribution
to the 70 µm from dust heated by the AGN. Again, as found
for the FIR colours, not all galaxies with low EW of the
PAH features have a 70 µm excess.

Excess of nuclear SFR obtained from 70 µm
over SFR from mid-infrared indicators

As showed in Section 4.4, all the nuclear 70 µm-based SFR
are systematically higher than those obtained by DSR2012
using the 11.3 µm PAH feature luminosity. We explained this
as due to systematics in the calibrations. For this reason, we
select those galaxies with the most discrepant values of SFR,
i.e. all the galaxies with a value of SF R1kpc/SF RD−S higher
than the median plus 1.4826 × M.A.D.. This could indicate
that part of the nuclear 70 µm emission of these galaxies
is due to the dust heated by the AGN. For this criterion
we can use 20 galaxies that are the ones in common with
DSR2012 and with measurements at 70 µm for r = 1 kpc.
We select 4 galaxies with 70 µm-based nuclear SFR higher
than expected taking into account the systematics in the
calibrations, namely, NGC 3783, NGC 4151, NGC 7213, and
NGC 7479. These four galaxies also satisfy some of the other
criteria above.

5.5 Comparison with other works

The results about the nuclear 70 µm emission obtained with
the above criteria are in good agreement with the detailed
Herschel imaging studies of the infrared emission of three
Seyfert galaxies, NGC 1365, NGC 2992, and NGC 3081 men-
tioned in Section 1. Alonso-Herrero et al. (2012) and Garc´ıa-
Bernete et al. (2015) found that the AGN emission does not
dominate the 70 µm emission of NGC 1365 and NGC 2992,
respectively. These two galaxies do not satisfy any of our
selection criteria. On the other hand, Ramos Almeida et al.
(2011) assumed that the nuclear 70µm ﬂux of NGC 3081 is
due to dust heated in the torus surrounding the AGN. They
modelled the unresolved infrared emission of this galaxy
with the Nenkova et al. (2008) clumpy torus models and
were able to reproduce the AGN bolometric luminosity. This
galaxy satisﬁes the 70 µm excess emission with respect to
the ﬁt of the FIR SEDs with a grey body with β = 2 cri-
terion. The reason why this galaxy does not meet the other
criteria may be due to the nuclear ring of 2 kpc in diameter.
Because of its distance we were not able to derive nuclear
r = 1 kpc dust temperature and fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux
ratio. Therefore we were restricted to measurements within
r = 2 kpc and the total galaxy.

We have 4 galaxies in common with the work of
Mullaney et al. (2011), namely, NGC 2110, NGC 4507,
NGC 5506, and IC 5063. Among these they found that the
only galaxy dominated by the AGN emission at 60 µm is
IC 5063 in good agreement with our results.

5.6 Inspection of the candidates to signiﬁcant

nuclear 70 µm AGN emission

Table 12 summarizes the selection criteria fulﬁlled by each
galaxy. In the last column we indicate the number of cri-
teria satisﬁed by each galaxy. 16 galaxies (48 per cent of
the sample) satisfy at least one of these requirements, while
10 of them ﬁt at least half of the criteria. We found no
diﬀerences between Seyfert 1 and 2 in terms of the selec-
tion requirements (p=0.30 with the Fisher’s test). Of the 16
galaxies that satisfy at least one criterion, 9 are Seyfert 1
and 7 Seyfert 2. We also found no diﬀerences between the
galaxies that satisfy at least one criterion and the galaxies
that donot satisfy any of them in terms of AGN luminosity
or 70 µm luminosity.

In what follows we take a conservative approach by only
considering the 10 RSA Seyferts in our sample that satisfy

5.7 MIR and FIR emission of the candidates to

signiﬁcant nuclear 70 µm AGN emission

None of the six candidates shows 11.3 µm PAH emission
in high angular resolution (0.5-0.7 arcsec scales) MIR spec-
troscopy (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2011; Gonz´alez-Mart´ın et al.
2013; Esquej et al. 2014; Alonso-Herrero et al. 2016) and all
of them show low values of the nuclear SFRs (see Table 1).
Hern´an-Caballero et al. (2015) performed a spectral decom-
position of 118 Spitzer IRS spectra of local AGN. The 6
candidates have a high AGN contribution (within the IRS
slit) at λ < 15 µm and an AGN 12 µm luminosity in agree-
ment with the estimates from nuclear high angular resolu-
tion spectra (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2011; Gonz´alez-Mart´ın
et al. 2013). We show the selected galaxies as the hatched
histogram in Fig. 11 and with black symbols in Figs. 12, 14,
and 15.

We used the diﬀerent criteria to estimate the range of
the AGN ﬂux at 70 µm. For each galaxy we only used the
criteria satisﬁed (see Table 12). For the galaxies that have
a 70 µm excess with respect to the ﬁt of the FIR SEDs
with a β = 2 grey body (see Section 5.3), we can estimate
directly the AGN ﬂux. For the galaxies that satisﬁed the
elevated fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratios (see Section 5.1),
or the excess of nuclear SFR obtained from 70 µm over SFR
from mid-infrared indicators (see Section 5.4) we make the
observed values compatible with the typical values of the
sample, and the excess is assumed to be the AGN emission.
For IC 5063 we obtain an AGN ﬂux at 70 µm of 1.8 Jy (40
per cent of the nuclear r = 2 kpc ﬂux) using the two criteria.
For NGC 5347 we can only calculate the contribution with
the excess with respect to the β = 2 grey body ﬁt. The
AGN contribution is approximately 0.7 Jy (61 per cent of
the nuclear r = 1 kpc ﬂux). For the rest of the galaxies we
obtain diﬀerent ﬂuxes depending on the criterion used to
estimate the 70 µm AGN ﬂux. The ranges are 1.0 − 1.3 Jy
for NGC 3783 (56 − 73 per cent of the nuclear r = 1 kpc
ﬂux); 2.4 − 3.0 Jy for NGC 4151 (49 − 62 per cent of the
nuclear r = 1 kpc ﬂux); 0.5 − 1.1 Jy for NGC 7213 (35 − 76
per cent of the nuclear r = 1 kpc ﬂux); and 4.1 − 5.4 Jy for
NGC 7479 (43−57 per cent of the nuclear r = 1 kpc ﬂux). We
ﬁnally note that the estimated AGN 70 µm ﬂuxes for IC 5063
and NGC 4151 are in good agreement with the predicted
torus FIR emission from the extrapolation of the ﬁts to the
unresolved near-infrared and MIR emission (Alonso-Herrero
et al. 2011; Ichikawa et al. 2015) using clumpy torus models.
Figure 16 shows the Spitzer/IRS SL+LL spectra for
these six galaxies, normalized at 30 µm. We also plot the
estimated AGN 70 µm ﬂux ranges and the average SEDs of
the low luminosity (log( L2−10keV
erg s−1 ) < 42.9) and high luminos-
ity (log( L2−10keV
erg s−1 ) > 42.9) AGN of Mullaney et al. (2011), all
of them normalized at 30 µm. All our candidates have MIR
and 70 µm AGN emission entirely consistent with the empir-
ically determined low and high luminosity AGN templates
of Mullaney et al. (2011), except around the 9.7 µm silicate
feature range for the two most extreme features (NGC 7213
and NGC 7479).

In summary, for our sample of 33 RSA Seyferts we found
a small fraction of galaxies (6/33, 18 per cent) with a sig-
niﬁcant contribution from AGN heated dust to the nuclear
70 µm emission. This fraction is similar to the ﬁndings of
Mullaney et al. (2011) for a sample of X-ray selected sample

median plus 1.4826 × M.A.D. The black symbols show the ﬁnal

(see Section 5.6).

half or more of the criteria deﬁned in the previous sections
to select candidates with a signiﬁcant AGN contribution to
the nuclear 70 µm emission.

We start by discarding two galaxies, NGC 4253 and
Mrk 1066, as both show 11.3 µm PAH emission in the inner
0.5 arcseconds, equivalent to physical sizes of 120 and 145 pc,
respectively (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2014, 2016) as well as
high SFR within r = 1 kpc scales. This probably suggests
that the elevated fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratios are due
to strong star formation rather than AGN dominated ﬂuxes
at 70 µm (see Ramos Almeida et al. 2014, for a detailed
discussion of Mrk 1066).

We next discuss NGC 4579 and NGC 4725, which
are among the least luminous AGN in our sample of
RSA Seyferts. Both are close to the low-luminosity AGN
(LLAGN) limit of 1042 erg s−1 below which the dusty torus
is predicted to disappear (Elitzur & Shlosman 2006). As can
be seen from Table 10, both galaxies show a signiﬁcant ex-
cess at 70 µm with respect to the β = 2 grey body ﬁt to the
integrated SED. However, if we assumed that the excess is
entirely due to dust heated by the AGN, then the AGN ﬂux
at 70 µm would be similar to the measured nuclear r = 1 kpc
ﬂux for NGC 4579 which is resolved (FWHM=600 pc) at this
wavelength. For NGC 4725 the predicted AGN ﬂux would
be more than twenty times brighter than that arising from
the nuclear (resolved) region with a 1.4 kpc size (FWHM).
We therefore conclude that the 70 µm nuclear emission of
NGC 4579 and NGC 4725 at the Herschel resolution is not
dominated by dust heated from the AGN.

We are left with six (18 per cent of the sample) bona
ﬁde candidates, namely, IC 5063, NGC 3783, NGC 4151,
NGC 5347, NGC 7213, and NGC 7479.

strates that our FIR method to select galaxies with sig-
niﬁcant nuclear 70 µm AGN emission for optically selected
Seyferts produces similar results to their MIR based method
for X-ray selected AGN.

6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we studied the nuclear and integrated FIR
(70 − 500 µm) emission of 33 nearby (median distance of
30 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies from the RSA catalogue using Her-
schel/PACS and SPIRE imaging observations. We selected
these galaxies because they are nearby and have estimates of
their nuclear and integrated SFR. The goal was to identify
galaxies with a signiﬁcant fraction of their 70 µm emission
produced by dust heated by the AGN by taking advantage
of the broad FIR spectral coverage and the good angular
resolution at 70 µm (median 0.8 kpc FWHM for our sam-
ple). We analysed the FIR properties of our sample, such as
the unresolved 70 µm emission and the nuclear (r = 1 kpc
and r = 2 kpc) and integrated FIR colours. We ﬁtted grey-
bodies to their SEDs and derived nuclear and integrated
SFR. We ﬁnally put forward four criteria to select galaxies
whose nuclear 70 µm emission has a signiﬁcant AGN con-
tribution. These were: (1) elevated fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm))
ﬂux ratios to the typical colours of star forming galaxies, (2)
dust temperature gradient higher than typical values of star
forming galaxies, (3) 70 µm excess emission with respect to
the ﬁt of the integrated FIR SEDs with a grey body with a
ﬁxed dust emissivity β = 2, and (4) excess of nuclear SFR

obtained from 70 µm over SFR from mid-infrared indicators.
The main results are as follows.

• At 70 µm most RSA Seyfert galaxies (85 per cent) in
our sample have a nuclear r = 2 kpc contribution to the total
ﬂux greater than 50 per cent. This is in good agreement with
results for the Swift/BAT AGN sample of Mushotzky et al.
(2014). The derived 70 µm sizes (FWHM) indicate that a
signiﬁcant fraction of this emission arises from regions 0.3−
2 kpc in size.
• The nuclear fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratio is higher
in the nuclear regions than for the entire galaxy. The in-
tegrated fν (70 µm)/fν (160 µm) ﬂux ratio distribution is
statistically indistinguishable from the distribution of the
Swift/BAT AGN sample of Mel´endez et al. (2014) and from
the normal galaxies of the KINGFISH sample Dale et al.
(2012). This conﬁrms previous results that the integrated
FIR emission of Seyfert galaxies is in general dominated by
the emission from their host galaxies rather than from the
AGN.
• The grey body ﬁts to the nuclear regions and the total
galaxy SEDs show that for a given galaxy the nuclear regions
(r = 1 kpc) have the highest temperatures, in agreement
with the spatially resolved maps of the dust temperatures
of nearby Seyfert and normal galaxies (see e.g. Bendo et al.
2012; S´anchez-Portal et al. 2013). The ﬁtted dust tempera-
tures (21 < T < 38 K) and dust emissivities (1.0 < β < 2.0)
from the integrated SEDs are similar to those of normal
galaxies.
• When ﬁtting the integrated SEDs using β=2, which
is the typical value for star forming galaxies (Li & Draine
2001), we found that 7 Seyfert galaxies in our sample have a
70 µm excess over the ﬁt greater than 28 per cent. This sug-
gests the presence of a hotter dust component, which could
be associated to the presence of a nuclear starburst and/or
dust heated by the AGN.
• The 70 µm nuclear SFRs derived with the C70µm,galaxy
coeﬃcient are on average 4 times higher than those obtained
by DSR2012 using the 11.3 µm PAH feature. Mushotzky et
al. (2014) and Petric et al. (2015) also found a discrepancy
of 3 between the SFR calculated through 70 µm and through
11.3 µm PAH feature.
• Taking into account the four criteria deﬁned to select
galaxies whose nuclear 70 µm emission has a signiﬁcant AGN
contribution, we found that 16 galaxies (48 per cent of the
sample) satisfy at least one of these criteria, whereas 10 sat-
isfy half or more of the criteria.
• By careful examination of the 10 candidates satisfying
at least half of the criteria, we selected six RSA Seyfert
galaxies (18 per cent of the initial sample) whose nuclear
(r = 1 − 2 kpc) 70 µm emission has a signiﬁcant (∼ 40 − 70
per cent) contribution from dust heated by the AGN. These
galaxies are IC 5063, NGC 3783, NGC 4151, NGC 5347,
NGC 7213, and NGC 7479. Four of them are Sy1 and 2 of
them are Sy2. None of them show 11.3 µm PAH emission on
scales of tens of parsecs from high angular resolution MIR
spectroscopy or high nuclear SFR.
• Our FIR method to select galaxies whose nuclear 70 µm
emission has a signiﬁcant AGN contribution for optically
selected Seyferts produces similar results to the Mullaney et
al. (2011) MIR based method for X-ray selected AGN, in

MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2015)

terms of the fraction of galaxies dominated by the AGN at
70 µm and the spectral shapes between 5 and 70 µm.

The criteria deﬁned in this work provide a good way to
select statistically Seyferts with signiﬁcant contribution of
the AGN at 70 µm using Herschel data.
