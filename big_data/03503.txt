Abstract

We derive a formula for the inﬁnitesimal phase response curve
(iPRC) of a limit cycle occurring in a piecewise smooth dynamical
system satisfying a transverse ﬂow condition. Discontinuous jumps in
the iPRC can occur at the boundaries separating subdomains. When
the subdomain dynamics are linear, we obtain an explicit expression
for the iPRC. We present examples from cell biology (Glass networks)
and neuroscience (central pattern generator models).

Introduction

1.1 Overview

A stable limit cycle is a closed, isolated periodic orbit in a nonlinear dynam-
ical system that attracts nearby trajectories [1]. Limit cycles arise in models
of biological motor control systems [2, 3], excitable membranes [4, 5], sensory
systems [6], neuropathologies such as Parkinsonian tremor [7] and epilepsy
[8]. Chemical oscillations arise when the diﬀerential equations describing
mass action kinetics admit a limit cycle [9]. Limit cycle dynamics arise not
only in biological but also in engineered systems. For instance, phase locked
loops play a role in radio and electronic communications devices [10], and
control of oscillations is an important problem in mechanical and electrical
engineering [11].

Formally, a nonlinear autonomous n-dimensional ordinary diﬀerential equa-

tion,

has a T -periodic limit cycle if it admits a periodic solution γ with minimal
period

and an open neighborhood of γ (the basin of attraction, B.A.) within which
all initial conditions give solutions converging, as t → ∞, to the set

Γ = {γ(s) : s ∈ [0, T )}.

(3)

In many situations the multidimensional dynamics of a stable limit cy-
cle oscillator can be accurately captured in a one dimensional phase model,

representing the fraction of progress around the limit cycle. The eﬀect of
weak inputs on the oscillator can be represented in terms of their eﬀect on
the timing of the limit cycle alone, the linear approximation to which is the
inﬁnitesimal phase response curve (iPRC). The iPRC has become a funda-
mental tool for understanding entrainment and synchronization phenomena
in weakly driven and weakly coupled oscillator systems, respectively [12, 13].
The iPRC gives the relative shift in timing per unit stimulus, as a function
of the phase at which the stimulus occurs, in the limit of small stimulus size
(Figure 1; Appendix C).

The iPRC is known in closed form in a handful of special cases: near a
supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation [5], near a saddle-node-on-invariant-
circle (SNIC) bifurcation [14], and for certain piecewise linear oscillator mod-
els [15, 16, 17]. The form of the iPRC near a homoclinic bifurcation is not
known in general, cf. [14, 18, 17].

For general smooth nonlinear systems with limit cycle dynamics, one may

arise from a dynamical system (1) where F : Rn → Rn is a C 1 diﬀerentiable

map, then the iPRC is a T -periodic vector function of time that obeys an
adjoint equation

(cid:124)
dz/dt = A(t)z(t), A(t) = − (DF (γ(t)))

(4)

together with the boundary condition z(t) = z(t + T ). The “adjoint opera-
tor” A(t) is the transpose of the Jacobian matrix DF evaluated at the limit
cycle γ(t) [5, 13].

This adjoint equation method breaks down for nonsmooth systems, i.e. for
systems such that the Jacobian DF is not deﬁned at all points around the
limit cycle. In particular, if F is a piecewise smooth vector ﬁeld, the Jaco-
bian linearization may break down at the boundaries separating the regions
within which the vector ﬁeld is smooth. The theory of isochrons, and the
subsequent iPRC, is well developed for smooth systems [20], with consider-
ably less literature for iPRCs in nonsmooth diﬀerential equations, such as
piecewise smooth systems (diﬀerential inclusions [21]). Inﬁnitesimal PRCs
have been computed explicitly in some planar systems [15, 17], but no formal
development of the iPRC exists for diﬀerential equations with discontinuous
right hand sides.

Nonsmooth oscillator models arise in both biological and engineered sys-
tems. Examples include planar nonlinear integrate-and-ﬁre neural models

[22], and models of anti-lock braking systems [23, 24]. Section §4 (Discussion)
mentions additional examples. Existence of oscillatory solutions in piecewise
smooth systems is a question of interest in its own right [25, 26, 21, 24, 27].
In this paper we provide a formula for the inﬁnitesimal phase response
curve of stable limit cycles that allows for discontinuities at the domain
boundaries of piecewise smooth dynamical systems. In the case of piecewise
linear systems, we obtain an explicit expression in terms of the system co-
eﬃcients for each subdomain through which the limit cycle travels, and the
tangent vectors of the surfaces separating the regions where the vector ﬁeld
deﬁnition changes (equation (26) in §2.2). To obtain these results we derive a
jump condition satisﬁed by the iPRC at the boundaries between subdomains.
The main results reported here appeared previously in the Master’s thesis

of the ﬁrst author [28].

1.2 A 1D example

To illustrate the necessity of including a jump condition in the phase re-
sponse for piecewise smooth systems, consider the following one-dimensional
example.

Let f1 and f2 be smooth, strictly positive functions deﬁned on the unit in-
terval. Identify the interval with the circle and let x ∈ [0, 1) evolve according
to

(5)

where 0 < a < 1 marks the location at which the rate law for x changes from
f1 to f2. The rate law changes back to f1 when x wraps around from one to
zero again. The period of this oscillator is

In the balance of this paper we calculate the form of the discontinuity in
the inﬁnitesimal phase response curve for a limit cycle in a piecewise smooth
dynamical system in arbitrary dimensions. In the case of limit cycles arising
in n-dimensional piecewise linear dynamical systems, we provide an explicit
closed form for the iPRC. We illustrate the application of this expression
with examples arising in mathematical neuroscience and mathematical cell
biology.

2.1 Deﬁnitions and Hypotheses Required to Solve the

Adjoint Equation Over Diﬀerential Inclusions

We introduce notation needed to discuss inﬁnitesimal phase response curves
for diﬀerential inclusion systems. For a general treatment of Filippov systems
see [21].

Limit cycles and asymptotic phase. In a smooth system of the form (1),
possessing a stable limit cycle γ, we associate a phase θ ∈ [0, 1) with points
along the cycle such that

dθ(γ(t))/dt = 1/T,

(8)

where T is the period of the limit cycle and θ(γ(t0)) = 0 is chosen arbitrarily.
To each point x0 in the basin of attraction (B.A.) we assign a phase θ(x0) ∈
[0, 1) such that the trajectory x(t) with initial condition x(0) = x0 satisﬁes

t→∞(cid:107)x(t) − γ(t + T θ(x0))(cid:107) → 0.
lim

(9)

The isochrons are level curves of the phase function θ(x0), and foliate the
basin of attraction. For a stable limit cycle in a smooth dynamical system,
the existence of the phase function is a well known consequence of results from
invariant manifold theory [20]. Intuitively, isochrons indicate which points in
the basin of attraction eventually converge to the limit cycle solution having
a particular phase.

Filippov systems. Let D be a path connected subset of Rn. We say that
an autonomous vector ﬁeld F : D → Rn is piecewise smooth on D if there

exist a ﬁnite number, R, of open sets Dr such that the following hypotheses
hold:

H1. Dr is nonempty, simply connected, and open for each r.

(cid:83)R

r=1

H2. Di ∩ Dj = ∅,∀i (cid:54)= j.
H3. D ⊂
H4. There exist analytic, bounded vector ﬁelds Fr : ¯Dr → Rn such that for

¯Dr.

all x in Dr, Fr(x) = F (x).

8

Note that we require Fr = F only on the interior of each open domain Dr,
while we require that each Fr be smooth on the closure ¯Dr.

The corresponding dynamical system

dx
dt

= F (x)

(10)

is called a piecewise smooth dynamical system or a Filippov system [21].

Figure 3: Sections of the piecewise smooth dynamical system. Full domain
boundaries are omitted for clarity. The ﬁrst segment of the limit cycle begins
at point γ1(0) ≡ pK|1 (marked (cid:52)) on the surface ΣK|1. At time T1 = t1 the
trajectory crosses surface Σ1|2 at point γ1(t1) ≡ p1|2 ≡ γ2(0) (marked (cid:3)).
The jth segment of the limit cycle travels from γj(0) ∈ Σj−1|j to γj(tj) ∈
Σj|j+1 in time tj; the crossing from region j to region j + 1 occurs at global
time Tj = t1+t2+. . .+tj and at location γj(tj) ≡ pj|j+1 ≡ γj+1(0). The cycle
returns to its starting point, pK|1 (marked (cid:52)), at time TK = t1 + . . . + tK.
Thus T = TK is the period of the limit cycle.

We further restrict our attention to Filippov systems satisfying the fol-

lowing assumptions:

9

1. The system (10) has a stable T -periodic limit cycle that crosses each
boundary transversely with nonzero speed. Because the limit cycle could
cross the same boundary multiple times, we introduce a separate label
for each segment of the limit cycle lying between two boundary cross-
ings (Figure 3). Thus, we label each piecewise smooth portion of the
limit cycle by a number k = 1, . . . , K (see Eq. (16)). The boundary
between the kth and (k + 1)st portions of the limit cycle is a surface
(with boundary), denoted Σk|k+1. We denote the point at which the
limit cycle crosses this boundary by pk|k+1 ∈ Σk|k+1.

2. Each boundary is at least C 1 in an open ball B(pk|k+1, c), centered at
pk|k+1 with radius c.
From this assumption it follows that at each
crossing point pk|k+1 there exists a tangent hyperplane spanned by n−1
orthonormal basis vectors, denoted ˆwk|k+1
for i = 1, . . . , n − 1, and
a unique normal vector ˆnk|k+1 directed from region k towards region
k + 1. Moreover, the vector ﬁelds Fk and Fk+1 are assumed to satisfy
a transverse crossing condition:

i

Fk(pk|k+1) · ˆnk|k+1 > 0
Fk+1(pk|k+1) · ˆnk|k+1 > 0.

(11)
(12)

3. The system (10) admits a ﬁnite period, stable limit cycle, with a well-
deﬁned phase function that can be extended to a continuous function
θ :B.A.→ S1 from the basin of attraction to the circle S1 ≡ [0, 1],
satisfying

along trajectories within the basin of attraction.

θ(x(t)) =

T

4. The level sets of the phase function θ (the isochronal surfaces) form a

continuous foliation of the basin of attraction.

5. The phase function, θ, is diﬀerentiable within the interior of each region

for which it is deﬁned.

6. At each boundary crossing point pk|k+1 ∈ Σk|k+1, the directional deriva-
tive of the phase function is deﬁned in the directions of each of the n−1
tangent vectors ˆwk|k+1

For smooth systems the iPRC z(t) = ∇θ(γ(t)) may be found using an

adjoint equation,

dz(t)

dt

= A(t)z(t),

(13)
where A(t) = −DF T (γ(t)), the negative transpose of the linearization of the
vector ﬁeld F evaluated along the limit cycle γ. To derive (13) one considers
an inﬁnitesimal perturbation x(t) = γ(t) + y(t) where ||y(t)|| (cid:28) 1 and γ(t)
is the limit cycle. As observed in [14], y(t) · z(t) is independent of time;
setting

d
dt

(y(t) · z(t)) = 0

(14)

gives an operator equation leading to the adjoint. We note that (14) holds
for piecewise smooth systems within the interior of each subdomain. We will
develop a parallel method for piecewise smooth vector ﬁelds and solve for
each limit cycle section γk, that is,

dzk(t)

dt

= Ak(t)zk(t),

(15)

where Ak(t) = −DFk(γk(t))T , the negative transpose of the linearization of
the vector ﬁeld Fk evaluated along the limit cycle portion γk. The remaining
challenge, and the contribution of the paper, is to establish the conditions
relating the iPRC on either side of each boundary crossing.

2.2 Solving the Boundary Problem of the Adjoint Equa-

tion

We ﬁx notation and deﬁne additional terms. Let Fk denote the vector ﬁeld in
which the kth portion of the limit cycle resides, where each Fk is numbered
sequentially.

The limit cycle, γ, is piecewise smooth, consisting of several curves γ1, γ2, . . . , γK.

As illustrated in Figure 3, each γk spends a time tk in some domain Dr. We
write the limit cycle γ as a collection of curves,



γ(t) =

γ1(t),
0 = T0 ≤ t < T1,
γ2(t − T1), T1 ≤ t < T2,
...
γK (t − TK−1) , TK−1 ≤ t < TK,

11

(16)

where Ti =(cid:80)i

j=1 tj is the global time at which the trajectory crosses bound-
ary surface Σi|i+1, and γk(tk) = γk+1(0) enforces continuity of the limit cycle.
At a limit cycle boundary crossing between the kth and (k + 1)st portions
of the limit cycle, there exist two adjacent vector ﬁelds Fk and Fk+1. These
vector ﬁelds evaluated at the limit cycle boundary crossing are denoted

Fk,tk = lim
t→t−
Fk+1,0 = lim
t→0+

k

Fk(γk(t)),

Fk+1(γk+1(t)).

(17)

In Eq. (17) and for the rest of this section, unless stated otherwise, the value
t will refer to the time elapsed within a particular region between boundary
crossings, i.e. for the kth limit cycle segment, t ∈ [0, tk). The one-sided limits
exist because each vector ﬁeld is required to be smooth on the closure of its
domain. The global iPRC, z, will be deﬁned in terms of the phase variable
θ ∈ [0, 1), but we will view the local iPRC zk(t) in terms of local time. The
independent variable of these iPRCs are related by

z(θ) = zk(θT − Tk−1) = zk(t).

(18)

We will use the local time t in the proofs to follow, so that we only need to
consider local dynamics at an arbitrary boundary crossing, without having
to refer to the global dynamics.

We deﬁne additional terms zk,tk and zk+1,0 by

zk,tk = lim
t→t−
zk+1,0 = lim
t→0+

k

zk(t),

zk+1(t)

(19)

where zk and zk+1 are the solutions to the adjoint equation (Eq. (15)) over
vector ﬁelds Fk and Fk+1, respectively. As a rule, the ﬁrst entry of the
subscript for either zk,t or Fk,t denotes the limit cycle section, and the second
entry of the subscript (when explicit) denotes the local time.

Theorem 2.1 Let γ be a piecewise smooth limit cycle of diﬀerential inclu-
sions satisfying hypotheses H1–H4 and assumptions 1.–6. The iPRC of γ
satisﬁes the following boundary condition at the boundary pk|k+1,

zk+1,0 = Mk|k+1zk,tk,

(20)

12

where Mk|k+1 is an n × n matrix, given as follows. Let bj denote the jth
coordinate of the vector ﬁeld Fk,tk, let aj be the jth coordinate of the vector
ﬁeld Fk+1,0, and let vi,j denote the jth entry of the ith tangent vector ˆwk|k+1
at the limit cycle boundary crossing, pk|k+1. The matrix Mk|k+1 is a product

Existence of the required matrix inverse is guaranteed by the transverse ﬂow
condition. See §A.1 for the proof of Theorem 2.1.
The following two corollaries specialize to the case of piecewise linear
vector ﬁelds. In this case the vector ﬁeld is not only piecewise smooth, but
the iPRC may be obtained in terms of matrix exponentials.

Corollary 2.2 With the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 and aﬃne linear vector
ﬁelds Fk, the initial condition of the iPRC, z(θ), must satisfy

z1,0 = Bz1,0,

(22)

where

B = MK|1eAK tK ··· M2|3eA2t2M1|2eA1t1,

(23)
tk is the time of ﬂight of the kth portion of the limit cycle, eAktk is the matrix
(cid:124)
exponential solution of the adjoint equation with Ak = − (DFk)
at time tk,
and DFk denotes the Jacobian matrix of the vector ﬁeld Fk. Eq. (22) and
the normalization condition,

(cid:104)F1,0, z1,0(cid:105) =

T

,

(24)

yield a unique solution for the initial condition, z1,0 ∈ Rn.

Proof See §A.2.

Remark 2.3 The Jacobian matrices Ak in Corollary 2.2 are distinct from
the matrices Ak appearing in the jump condition in Theorem 2.1.

Remark 2.5 For examples of the matrices Mk|k+1 see Eqs. (38) (Glass net-
work), (59), (63), (65) (Iris system), and (78), (80), (82) (3D piecewise
linear central pattern generator).

Shaw et al. 2012 considered a piecewise linear system satisfying the as-
sumptions of Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2, where the vector ﬁeld is piece-
wise diﬀerentiable but discontinous at subdomain boundaries. Our theory
correctly captures all discontinuities of the iPRC at the boundaries (Figure

14

8). Coombes (2008) considered systems with continuous vector ﬁelds not
necessarily diﬀerentiable at domain boundaries, and analytically computed
continuous iPRCs for each system. In the following corollary, we show that a
continuous iPRC is a general property of limit cycles over continuous, piece-
wise smooth vector ﬁelds.

Corollary 2.6 Under the assumptions of Corollary 2.2, if adjacent vector
ﬁelds evaluated along the limit cycle, Fk+1,0 and Fk,tk, are continuous at the
boundary pk|k+1, then the matrix Mk|k+1 is the identity matrix.

Proof See §A.4.
Remark 2.7 Our analysis therefore includes the iPRC calculations of [15]
and [17] as special cases.

3 Results

We apply our analysis to three examples. The ﬁrst is a 2D Glass network, a
piecewise linear system obtained as the singular limit of a class of models for
feedback inhibition and gene regulatory networks [29]. The second example is
a planar system introduced in [17], motivated by investigations of heteroclinic
channels as a dynamical architecture for motor control. The third example is
a 3D piecewise linear system arising as a simpliﬁcation of a nominal central
pattern generator model for regulation of feeding motor activity in the marine
mollusc Aplysia californica [30] and related to a Lotka-Volterra system with
three populations [31].

3.1 Two Dimensional Glass Network

Glass, Perez, and Pasternack introduced a planar piecewise linear system as
a model of feedback inhibition in a genetic regulatory circuit [32, 29]. Figure
4 illustrates several trajectories converging to a stable limit cycle in such
a network. The concentration x1 stimulates the production of x2, while x2
inhibits the production of x1. One may also consider a macroscopic analogue
in a predator-prey system, where x1 is the prey and x2 is the predator.

target point located in the subsequent quadrant (Figure 4).

In local time, the solution to Eq. (28) takes the form,

where

The limit cycle attractor and its points of intersection with each axis is
found by choosing an intial condition on the positive x1-axis and propagating
Eq. (30) forward in time until it returns to the positive x1-axis. This method
generates a Poincar´e map, and the stable limit cycle intersection is a solution
to a quadratic equation. We call this point of intersection p4|1 because the
limit cycle intersects the boundary between regions 1 and 4.

Figure 4: A model of feedback inhibition as discussed in Example 1 of Glass
and Pasternack 1978. The limit cycle attractor (purple) traverses four quad-
rants, which serve as the four domains of the model. We call the ﬁrst quad-
rant region 1, and because the solutions travel counter-clockwise, the second
quadrant is named region 2, the third quadrant region 3, and the fourth
quadrant region 4. Within each quadrant, trajectories are attracted to a tar-
get point outside the domain, as shown by the black and gray dashed lines.
For example, in region 1, the limit cycle trajectory (purple) is attracted to
the target point (a1, b1) until it hits the positive y-axis, at which point the
limit cycle trajectory changes direction towards the next target point, (a2, b2).
Two sample trajectories in the same region, one inside (blue) and one outside
(red) the limit cycle, demonstrate that the purple loop is indeed a limit cycle
attractor. The target points are (a1, b1) = (−5, 11), (a2, b2) = (−10,−4),
(a3, b3) = (6,−10), and (a4, b4) = (10, 5).

3.2 Piecewise Linear Iris System With Non-Uniform

Saddle Values

In [17], we analyzed the inﬁnitesimal phase response curve (iPRC) of a limit
cycle arising from a heteroclinic bifurcation. The model, called the “sine
system” in [17], exhibits a stable heteroclinic cycle (SHC) consisting of four
planar saddle points related by four-fold rotational symmetry. By introducing
a twist in the vector ﬁeld, the sine system produces a one-parameter family of
limit cycles that approach the SHC as the parameter goes to zero. The model
arose in an investigation of the role of saddle ﬁxed points in the regulation
of timing in central pattern generator circuits. Using numerical simulations,
we showed that inﬁnitesimal perturbations to limit cycle trajectories near
the heteroclinic bifurcation could cause long delays in the traversal about
the limit cycle of the trajectory, leading to large phase oﬀsets. This property

21

provides a mechanism by which animals could activate muscles for long times
during control of repetitive underlying movements.

As part of this study, [17] introduced a piecewise linear analogue (the
“iris system”) that has a structurally similar bifurcation in which an SHC
gives rise to a one-parameter family of limit cycles similar to those in the sine
system. The piecewise linear analogue consists of four regions with velocity
ﬁelds equivalent, under successive 90-degree rotations, to the velocity ﬁeld in
the unit square,

dˆs
dt
dˆu
dt

= −λˆs,
= ˆu,

(47)

where ˆs represents the local coordinate along the stable manifold of the saddle
at (0, 0), and ˆu represents the local coordinate along the unstable manifold
of the same saddle. As written, these dynamics represent the ﬂow of region 1
in Figure 6. Existence of a limit cycle is guaranteed as long as the function,

ˆuλ − ˆu + a = 0,

(48)

has two roots [17]. The stable root, which we call u, represents the nontrivial
entry coordinate of each region, and must be derived numerically for most
choices of λ > 1.

The piecewise linear iris system allows for the exact derivation of the
inﬁnitesimal phase response curve arbitrarily close to the heteroclinic bi-
furcation.
In [17] we derived the iPRC by summing an inﬁnite series, a
technique that does not readily generalize to systems with fewer symmetries.
To illustrate the utility of Theorem 2.1, we alter the iris system so that dif-
ferent squares have diﬀerent saddle values, λk for k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. The local
coordinates must be deﬁned separately for each region,

dˆsk
dt

= −λkˆsk,

(49)

where ˆsk and ˆuk are the local coordinates of the kth modiﬁed iris square (see
Figure 7). As in the iris system, the new system also satisﬁes hypotheses
1.-6. The ﬁrst hypothesis calls for the existence of a limit cycle, which is

ily found using Newton’s method. We are now ready to apply Theorem 2.1
and Corollary 2.2 to derive the iPRC of the modiﬁed iris system analytically.

3.3 Nominal Biting Model of Aplysia Californica

Shaw et al. developed a model for a feeding pattern generator comprising
three pools of motor neurons interacting with a nominal biomechanical model
of the feeding apparatus of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica [33, 30].
The motor pools interact through quadratic (Lotka-Volterra) asymmetric
lateral inhibitory coupling [34, 35], given by the equations

dbi
dt

= fi = bi − b2

i + µ − ρbibi+1,

i = 1, 2, 3.

(71)

The state variable bi for i = 1, 2, 3, represents activation of the ith motor
pool, the parameter µ ≥ 0 acts as a bifurcation parameter, and ρ represents
coupling strength between adjacent nodes bi. The dynamics of the model
depend on the parameters µ and ρ. When µ and ρ are zero, each equation
reduces to three independent logistic curve equations. For some nonzero
values of ρ, and µ = 0, the system forms an attracting stable heteroclinic
channel (SHC) consisting of three saddle points with the unstable manifold
of each saddle intersecting the stable manifold of the next saddle. When
both µ and ρ are chosen appropriately, the heteroclinic connections break
and the unstable manifolds spiral into a stable limit cycle [33]. For small
positive values of µ, trajectories slow signiﬁcantly while passing near the
succession of saddle equilibria. This behavior allows the model to reproduce
the extended dwell times in localized areas of phase space observed in in vivo
recordings of Aplysia motor activity.

Linearization of Eq. (71) about the three saddle equilibriua leads to a
piecewise linear diﬀerential inclusion (Appendix B). Written in the order of

lie in equal thirds of the unit cube, which, when a = 0, all share an edge
along the vector (1, 1, 1). For a = 0, the domain of region 1 is the convex hull
of the vertices (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), and (1, 1, 1). Similarly, the domain
of region 2 is the convex hull of the vertices (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), and
(1, 1, 1), and the domain of region 3 is deﬁned by the vertices (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1),
(0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1). The saddle points of the system lie on a vertex of each
domain, namely at (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1), for regions 1, 2, and 3,
respectively. Each saddle point has a two dimensional stable manifold and
one dimensional unstable manifold (Figure 9). Because the vector ﬁeld is
linear within each region, the stable manifold is a plane spanned by the two
stable eigenvectors of the Jacobian for each region, and the unstable manifold
is the (half) line in the direction of the unstable eigenvector. The two stable
eigenvectors and the unstable eigenvector for region 1 are, respectively,

As in the example of the modiﬁed iris system, the limit cycle of this
nominal piecewise linear SHC model is not analytically computable. The
limit cycle coordinates are obtained numerically; we denote them pk|k+1 =
(ηk+1, κk+1, νk+1), i.e., for the kth portion of the limit cycle, its initial value
is the vector γk,0 = (ηk, κk, νk). We now calculate the jump matrices Mk|k+1
for each boundary pk|k+1, beginning with region 1.

The values p3|1 and T represent the initial condition of the limit cycle and
the total period of the limit cycle, respectively, and are found numerically.
The iPRC is found by combining (26) with the jump matrices (78), (80),
(82) and matrix exponentials Eqs. (84). Figure 10 plots the resulting iPRC
together with the iPRC obtained numerically by the direct perturbation
method, showing good agreement.

4 Discussion

In this paper we have derived the form of the discontinuity in the inﬁnitesimal
phase response curve at domain boundaries for a generic limit cycle arising
in a piecewise smooth dynamical system. Our results apply broadly, because
many systems have the structure we discuss. Nevertheless some caveats are
in order.

The iPRC does not always capture the response to a stimulus. In situ-
ations in which the linear approximation to the asymptotic phase function
breaks down, for instance when the stimulus drives the oscillator’s trajectory
close to the stable manifold of a saddle point on the boundary of the basin of

attraction, mechanisms such as shear-induced chaos can lead to complicated
responses to periodic forcing that cannot be predicted via iPRC analysis.
This scenario can arise near the homoclinic bifurcation in the Morris-Lecar
model, for example [18]. Nevertheless, in many systems the iPRC plays an
important role in understanding oscillator entrainment and synchronization.
Limit cycles with a sliding component, see [36], do not satisfy the trans-

0.00.20.40.60.81.0θ−101234567z(θ)verse boundary crossing assumption, and our theory does not apply. More-
over, our results presume the existence and uniqueness of an asymptotic
phase function on the basin of attraction of an oscillator; and that the phase
function is continuous throughout the basin of attraction, C 1 within the do-
mains, and diﬀerentiable at the domain boundaries in all directions tangent
to the boundary (Assumptions 3.–6.). For smooth systems, existence, unique-
ness and diﬀerentiability of the phase function follows from classical results
of invariant manifold theory [20]. To our knowledge, parallel results have not
been established in full generality for piecewise smooth systems. However, for
the examples considered here, the theoretically obtained iPRCs coincide with
the iPRCs obtained through direct numerical simulation. Speciﬁcally, we val-
idated our calculations for three piecewise linear examples: a 2-dimensional
Glass network, a family of 2-dimensional piecewise linear models verging on
a heteroclinic cycle, and a 3-dimensional piecewise linear model motivated
by motor control in the Aplysia californica feeding system. In each exam-
ple we computed the iPRCs analytically and found strong agreement with
numerically derived iPRCs (Figures 5, 8, and 10).

In the examples we consider, the decomposition of the vector ﬁeld into
piecewise linear domains is speciﬁed in the statement of the original system.
The approximation of limit cycles in a smooth system, with limit cycles in
a piecewise linear system, has been investigated in a general setting [37].
However, there is no a priori heuristic for how to approximate an arbitrary
nonlinear system with a piecewise linear approximation.

The extension of results from classical dynamical systems to nonsmooth
systems is an active area of research with applications in a wide variety of
contexts. Carmona et al. studied a canonical form for limit cycles in planar
PWL dynamical systems with two regions [38], using Melnikov methods to
study existence and bifurcations of limit cycles. Ponce et al. studied bifur-
cations leading to limit cycles in PWL planar systems in [39]. Existence of
limit cycles has been shown for planar PWL systems with two regions in
[26] and [27], for planar PWL systems with an arbitrary but ﬁnite number
of separate regions in [25], and for a PWL system in R4 with three regions
in [40]. Stability of piecewise linear limit cycles in Rn with m + 1 regions is
analyzed in [41] using Poincar´e map techniques. The review [42] discusses
necessary and suﬃcient conditions for asymptotic stability of piecewise linear
systems in Rn; [43] adapts Lyapunov functions for piecewise linear systems.
Limit cycles in piecewise linear systems occur not only in biology but also
in control engineering [44]. Piecewise linear systems arise naturally in anti-

36

lock braking systems [24], which are themselves engineered to produce limit
cycle oscillations [23]. Piecewise smooth relay feedback systems, ﬁrst used
in heating [45] and more recently in (PID) control [46], can give rise to limit
cycles. The exact conditions for limit cycle existence in relay feedback sys-
tems is given in [47]. Many piecweise linear biological models exist as well.
A piecewise linear version of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model (also called the
McKean model) and a piecewise linear version of the Morris-Lecar model are
studied in [15]. The authors in [48] convert the Hindmarsch-Rose model into
a piecewise linear version and analyze its stability. Gene regulatory networks
are a classic example of piecewise linear models exhibiting limit cycle oscilla-
tions [29], and a subject of ongoing research. For instance, [49] analyzes the
stability of synchronous periodic solutions, assuming weak symmetric cou-
pling of two Glass networks. Rigorous investigations of Glass networks have
considered them within the framework of diﬀerential inclusions [50, 51]. To
facilitate construction of networks with customized dynamics [52] systemat-
ically classiﬁed cyclic attractors on Glass networks with up to six switching
units. In summary, there is a rich collection of contexts in which piecewise
linear and piecewise smooth systems arise.

5 Conclusion

The inﬁnitesimal phase response curve provides a linear approximation to the
geometry of the asymptotic phase function in the vicinity of a stable limit
cycle. The classical method for obtaining iPRCs from the adjoint [53] breaks
down with nonsmooth dynamics because the Jacobian may not be well de-
ﬁned at the domain boundaries. In this paper we have introduced a general
theory for the iPRCs for limit cycles arising in piecewise smooth systems,
provided the limit cycle intersects the domain boundaries transversely and
the boundaries are smooth at the points of intersection. In the case of piece-
wise smooth system which are also continuous across the domain boundaries,
we obtain continuous iPRCs. Discontinuities in the iPRCs may arise when
the vector ﬁeld is discontinuous across domain boundaries, and our analysis
provides the explicit form of the discontinuity. Our results are consistent
with, and extend, existing ﬁndings, such as [15]. Because piecewise smooth
and piecewise linear systems arise in a wide variety of ﬁelds, from biology to
engineering, our analysis has the potential for broad application.

A Proofs of the Main Results

A.1 Proof of Theorem 2.1

From assumptions 1.–3., γ is a piecewise smooth limit cycle that admits a
phase function θ(x) throughout the basin of attraction (B.A.), such that
dθ/dt = 1/T throughout the B.A. Also by assumption, θ is diﬀerentiable
(C 1) in the interior of each region and continuous (C 0) at the boundaries
between successive regions (assumptions 4. and 5.).

For a piecewise smooth dynamical system satisfying hypotheses H1–H4
and assumptions 1.–2., the crossing point pk|k+1 lies in an n − 1 dimensional
surface Σk|k+1 that is C 1 within a ball B(pk|k+1, c) of radius c, and admits a
unique unit length normal vector ˆn oriented in the direction of the ﬂow. By
Gram–Schmidt, we may construct n−1 orthonormal vectors ˆwi spanning the
hyperplane tangent to Σk|k+1 at pk|k+1 orthogonal to ˆn for all i = 1, . . . , n−1.
Introduce local coordinates u on B(pk|k+1) ∩ Σk|k+1 such that u = 0
corresponds to the point pk|k+1. Let θk denote the phase function θ within
the kth domain. Although the gradient ∇θ is not deﬁned at points on the
boundary Σk|k+1, we have well deﬁned directional derivatives

Dw(θk)(xk) = lim
h→0

Dw(θk)(xk+1) = lim
h→0

(θ(xk+1 + hw) − θ(xk+1))

(88)

(89)

for points xk and xk+1 in the interior of region k and region k+1, respectively.
Fixing a basis vector ˆwi in the plane tangent to Σk|k+1 at pk|k+1 and taking
the limits as xk → pk|k+1 and xk+1 → pk|k+1, we have (assumption 6.)

(90)

ˆwi · ∇θk+1(u) = ˆwi · ∇θk(u),

∀i = 1, . . . , n − 1
(for simplicity, we use ˆwi in place of ˆwk|k+1
). For u = 0, the gradient of
the phase function is evaluated along the limit cycle. Referring back to the
notation of Eq. (19) we have

i

ˆwi · zk+1,0 = ˆwi · zk,tk,

∀i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

(91)

Eq. (91) provides n − 1 independent linear equations for the n unknown
values zj, j = 1, . . . n. To obtain an nth independent linear equation, let

38

m ∈ {k, k + 1} and let xm(t) be a trajectory in the basin of attraction of
vector ﬁeld Fm. By the chain rule,

dθm
dt

= [∇θm(xm(t))] ·
xm(t)
= Fm(xm(t)) · ∇θm(xm(t)).

d
dt

(92)

For a trajectory xm(t) on the limit cycle, i.e., when xm(t) = γm(t), we have
by deﬁnition of the iPRC (Appendix C),

dθm
dt

= Fm(γm(t)) · zm(t).

Recalling that dθ/dt = 1/T , taking the one-sided limits,

lim
t→0+

Fk+1(γk+1(t)) · zk+1(t) = Fk+1,0 · zk+1,0,
lim
t→t−

Fk(γk(t)) · zk(t) = Fk,tk · zk,tk,

k

therefore

Fk+1,0 · zk+1,0 =

1
T

= Fk,tk · zk,tk.

(93)

(94)

(95)

Eq. (95) asserts that the phase function advances at the same rate as a
function of time everywhere, and in particular on both sides of the boundary
point pk|k+1. Combining Eq. (95) with Eqs. (91) provides n independent
linear equations:

Fk+1,0 · zk+1,0 = Fk,tk · zk,tk,
ˆw1 · zk+1,0 = ˆw1 · zk,tk,
ˆw2 · zk+1,0 = ˆw2 · zk,tk,

...

ˆwn−1 · zk+1,0 = ˆwn−1 · zk,tk,

(96)

which are equivalent to the equality expressed in Theorem 2.1 in terms of
the n × n matrices Ak+1 and Bk as deﬁned in the theorem.
In order to solve for the initial value of the iPRC of the k+1 portion of the
limit cycle, zk+1,0, we must invert the matrix Ak+1. The invertibility of Ak+1
is guaranteed because the vector ﬁeld value Fk+1,0 and the n − 1 tangent
vectors are linearly dependent if and only if Fk+1,0 ∈ span( ˆw1, . . . , ˆwn−1).

39

However, the vector Fk+1,0 can not be written as a linear combination of
every ˆwi, because the vector Fk+1,0 is always transverse to the boundary at
the point pk|k+1, by assumption. Therefore, the vector Fk+1,0 and the n − 1
orthonormal basis vectors of the tangent hyperplane at the point pk|k+1 are
linearly independent, and the matrix Ak+1 is invertible.
proof applies to all boundary crossings of the limit cycle.

The boundary crossing point considered in the proof is arbitrary, so the

A.2 Proof of Corollary 2.2

We adopt the same assumptions as Theorem 2.1. By the assumptions stated
in Section 2.1, the limit cycle, γ, consists of K distinct sections, each passing
through a linear vector ﬁeld F1, F2, . . . , FK. The solution to the adjoint
equation of the ﬁrst region (Eq. (15)) is

z1(t) = eA1t ˆz1,0,

(97)

where A1 = −DF1(γ1(t))T , the negative transpose of the Jacobian matrix
DF1 evaluated along the limit cycle γ(t), eA1t is a matrix exponential, and
ˆz1,0 is an initial condition of the iPRC in the ﬁrst region. Because the vector
ﬁeld is linear within each region, the Jacobian matrix is piecewise constant.
The initial condition of the iPRC of the next region z2,0 may be written in
terms of the initial condition of the iPRC of the ﬁrst region:

z2,0 = M1|2z1,t1

= M1|2eA1t1 ˆz1,0.

(98)

Similarly, the initial condition of the iPRC of the third region may be written
as,

z3,0 = M2|3z2,t2

= M2|3eA2t2M1|2eA1t1 ˆz1,0,

(99)

and so forth. Upon traversing the Kth region we return to ˆz1,0, which must
satisfy

ˆz1,0 = MK|1eAK tK ··· M1|2eA1t1 ˆz1,0 =: B ˆz1,0.

(100)

Therefore ˆz1,0 is a unit eigenvector of B. Uniqueness of the unit eigenvector
(up to multiplication by a constant) follows from the stability of the limit

If Bq = q for another eigenvector q (cid:54)∈ span(ˆz1,0),
cycle (assumption 1.).
an arbitrarily small initial condition could be found near pK|1 that did not
converge to γ.

Uniqueness of the magnitude of ˆz1,0 comes from Eq. (24), which we recall

to be,

(cid:104)F1,0, z1,0(cid:105) =

1
T

,

(101)

where z1,0 is the unique initial condition of the iPRC of region 1. The vec-
tor ˆz1,0 must be scaled by some constant α to be equivalent to the initial
condition, z1,0. We can calculate the scaling by use of Eq. (101):

(cid:104)F1,0, α ˆz1,0(cid:105) =
α(cid:104)F1,0, ˆz1,0(cid:105) =
α =

1
T
1
T

1

T(cid:104)F1,0, ˆz1,0(cid:105)

.

Thus the unique initial condition of the iPRC, z1,0 is

z1,0 = α ˆz1,0

=

ˆz1,0

T(cid:104)F1,0, ˆz1,0(cid:105)

.

(102)

(103)

This concludes the proof of uniqueness for the initial condition of the iPRC
for aﬃne linear vector ﬁelds satisfying Theorem 2.1.

A.3 Proof of Corollary 2.4

Let t denote global time, Tk =(cid:80)K

k=1 tk where tk is the time of ﬂight for region
k, and Ak = −(DFk)T , where DFk is the Jacobian matrix of the vector ﬁeld
Fk. Beginning with region 1, the aﬃne linear vector ﬁeld assumption allows
us to explicitly solve for the iPRC using matrix exponentials. We determine
the initial condition of region 1, z1,0, using Corollary 2.2. Then for any
0 ≤ t < T1,

z(t) = eA1tz1,0.

This iPRC solution reaches the next boundary at time t1, and takes the value
−
1 ) = eA1t1z1,0. To continue the solution into the next region, we compute
z(t
−
the jump matrix M1|2 using Theorem 2.1 and apply it to the value z(t
1 ) to

41

(104)

place the iPRC solution on the initial condition on the boundary of region
2, z2,0 ≡ M1|2eA1t1z1,0. Using this initial condition, and for any T1 < t < T2,
we compute the iPRC solution to be

z(t) = eA2(t−T1)z2,0 ≡ eA2(t−T1)M1|2eA1t1z1,0.

(105)

By repeating this process into the ﬁnal region K, the solution results in
an alternating product of jump matrices and matrix exponentials for any
TK−1 < t < TK:

z(t) = eAk(t−TK−1)MK−1|KeAK−1tK−1 ··· M1|2eA1t1z1,0.

(106)

This equation completes the proof.

Remark A.1 Because the iPRC solution is periodic and isolated, continuing
this process from region K into region 1 results in the solution

z(t) = eA1tM1|KeAk(tK ) ··· M1|2eA1t1z1,0

= eA1tBz1,0,

(107)

for nT ≤ t < nT +T1, for any integer n. The last line is a trivial substitution
that follows from Corollary 2.2.

A.4 Proof of Corollary 2.6

If the vector ﬁelds are of class C 0 over boundaries, then the vector ﬁeld coor-
dinates ai and bi (see Eq. (21)) are equal for each i. Therefore, the matrices
−1
Ak+1 and Bk of Eq. (21) are identical, and because Mk|k+1 = A
k+1Bk, the
matrix Mk|k+1 reduces to the identity matrix for each k.

B Derivation of the Aplysia Biting Model

prising three motor pools with activities bi obeying the following dynamics:

where i = 1, 2, 3, µ is the bifurcation parameter, ρ is the strength of coupling,
and addition is interpreted cyclically.

We linearize about each saddle point at the heteroclinic bifurcation, and
subsequently introduce the bifurcation parameter a to oﬀset each vector ﬁeld
and create a limit cycle. The linearization of system (71) yields the Jacobian

C Derivation of the iPRC for Smooth Sys-

tems

The change in phase, ∆θ, in response to a perturbation of size ε in the unit
vector direction η, depends on the time at which the perturbation occurs.
To derive the inﬁnitesimal phase response curve, when the asymptotic phase
function θ is C 1, we expand the function to ﬁrst order in ε.
θ(γ(t) + εη) = θ(γ(t)) + εDθ(γ(t)) · η + O(ε2)

(111)

where D denotes the directional derivative. The change in phase for a small
perturbation of magnitude ε and direction η is

∆θ = θ(γ(t) + εη) − θ(γ(t)) = εDθ(γ(t)) · η + O(ε2)
