Abstract

We study the eﬀective time evolution of a large quantum system
consisting of a mixture of diﬀerent species of identical bosons in inter-
action. If the system is initially prepared so as to exhibit condensation
in each component, we prove that condensation persists at later times
and we show quantitatively that the many-body Schr¨odinger dynam-
ics is eﬀectively described by a system of coupled cubic non-linear
Schr¨odinger equations, one for each component.

Keywords: eﬀective evolution equations, many-body quantum dy-
namics, mixture condensate, partial trace, reduced density matrix,

Introduction: BEC mixtures and non-linear ef-
fective dynamics

Bose-Einstein condensation is the well-known quantum phenomenon that
occurs in a large many-body system of identical bosons when a macroscopic
number of particles occupy the same one-body state. It can be thought of

as a crowding phenomenon where the many-body state is for a large part
factorised into the product of identical copies of the same one-body orbital,
the condensate wave-function.

The mathematics of the Bose gas and its condensation is an extraordi-
narily rich and active subject that dates back from the very ﬁrst systematic
treatment of Bogolubov in the mid 1940’s (that is, some 20 years after the
theoretical discovery of BEC), to which the ﬁrst experimental realisations
of condensates in the mid 1990’s and the subsequent advances in the tech-
niques for manipulating ultra-cold atoms have boosted new motivation and
impulse. The literature is therefore huge: we refer to the monograph [4]
for what concerns the “static” picture (emergence of BEC, characterisation
of the ground state, etc.) and to the works we will be mentioning in the
following and to the references therein for the “dynamical” picture (the con-
densate’s evolution).

Let us only recall here a few main and well-known points in order to

formulate our problem. Let us consider the Hilbert space

h = L2(Λ) ⊗ C2s+1

(1.1)
for a quantum particle of spin s ∈ 1
N0 conﬁned in a domain Λ ⊂ Rd (possibly
Rd itself) and, correspondingly, for a d-dimensional (bosonic) system of N
such particles, let us consider the Hilbert spaces

2

HN = h⊗N ,

HN,sym = h⊗N
sym ,

(1.2)

namely the N -fold and the symmetric N -fold tensor product of h. Let γN ,
a positive trace-class operator on HN,sym with unit trace, be the density
matrix describing a state of a given bosonic system. Consistently with the
physical notion of “occupation numbers”, the standard mathematical tool
to express the occurrence of BEC when the system is in the state γN is the
so-called one-body marginal (or one-body reduced density matrix)

γ(1)
N = TrN −1 γN .

(1.3)

Here, the map TrN −1 : B1(HN,sym) → B1(h) is the partial trace from trace
class operators on HN to trace class operators on h, deﬁned by

hϕ, (TrN −1 T )ψih = Xk

hϕ ⊗ ξk, T ψ ⊗ ξkiHN

∀ϕ, ψ ∈ h,

(1.4)

where (ξk)k is an orthonormal basis of HN −1,sym. Observe that (1.4) is in
fact independent of the choice of the basis and is equivalent to

Trh(A · TrN −1 T ) = TrH(A ⊗ 1N −1) · T ))
N is obtained by “tracing out” N − 1 degrees of freedom from
for example, for a system of N spinless (s = 0) bosons in the pure

∀A ∈ B(h) .

(1.5)

Thus, γ(1)
γN :

2

state ΨN,sym ∈ L2(RN d, dx1 ··· dxN ) (L2
N,sim ≡ the wave-functions that are
symmetric under permutation of any two variables), the corresponding one-
body marginal γ(1)

N has kernel

γ(1)

N (x, x′) = ZR(N −1)d

ΨN (x, x2, . . . , xN ) ΨN (x′, x2, . . . , xN ) dx2 ··· dxN .

Being a density matrix, the one-body marginal γ(1)

(1.6)
N has a complete set
of real non-negative eigenvalues that sum up to 1, and being it the partial
trace of a many-body state γN , it is natural to think of these eigenvalues
as the occupation numbers in γN , that is, each eigenvalue of γ(1)
N can be
interpreted as the fraction of the N particles that are in the same one-body
state given by eigenvector associated with the considered eigenvalue.

In a sense to be speciﬁed in the given context, one therefore says that
the many-body state γN exhibits condensation in the state ϕ ∈ h (kϕk = 1)
if ϕ is an eigenvector of γ(1)
N that belongs to a non-degenerate eigenvalue
that is by far larger than all other eigenvalues, i.e., it is almost 1 while all
other eigenvalues are almost zero. In other words, γ(1)
N ≈ |ϕihϕ|, the rank-
one projection onto ϕ. This notion of condensation becomes conceptually
well-posed and mathematically rigorous in the limit N → ∞ – a genuine
thermodynamic limit, or some simpler prescription on N → ∞ that mimics
the thermodynamic limit. For the present discussion we only consider the
case of complete condensation, namely

lim
N→∞

γ(1)
N = |ϕihϕ|

(complete BEC) .

(1.7)

Even if a priori the limit in (1.7) can be stated in several inequivalent op-
erator topologies, from the trace norm to the weak operator topology, the
bounds

(1.8)

1 − hϕ, γ(1)

N − |ϕihϕ|(cid:12)(cid:12) 6 2q1 − hϕ, γ(1)

N ϕi

(see Lemma 3.2 below) show that the occurrence of the convergence γ(1)
N →
|ϕihϕ| can be monitored equivalently in any of them.
In (1.7) ϕ is customarily referred to as the condensate wave-function
and in the presence of condensation the diagonal γ(1)
N (x, x) of the one-body
marginal becomes, for large N , a good approximation of the condensate pro-
ﬁle |ϕ(x)|2. While the limit (1.7) is naturally interpreted as if the many-body
state was almost completely factorised as ϕ⊗N , the closeness γ(1)
N ≈ |ϕihϕ|
is obviously much weaker than the actual closeness ΨN ≈ ϕ⊗N in the norm
of HN . It can instead be argued that γ(1)
N ≈ |ϕihϕ| implies a factorisation of
the many-body state when an amount k = O(N ) of particles are considered:
for the precise meaning of this control, as well as for equivalent characteri-
sation of complete BEC, we refer to [6] and [3, Section 2], as well as to the
following considerations in Section 3.

Within this formalism, the dynamical problem for the time evolution of
a condensate is the problem of the persistence of BEC, in the form of the
asymptotic condition (1.7), along the evolution γN 7→ γN,t = e−itHN γN eitHN
governed by a given many-body Hamiltonian HN , and thus of the rigorous
derivation of the law ϕ 7→ ϕt that gives the condensate wave-function at
later times. Whereas the solution to the Schr¨odinger equation for a system
of N interacting particles is obviously out of reach when N is large, both
analytically and numerically, the language of the reduced density matrix
boils down the dynamical problem to the level of one-body states, a major
simpliﬁcation in which one renounces to the complete knowledge of γN,t.
The price is the replacement of the many-body linear dynamics for γN,t
with an eﬀective non-linear dynamics for ϕt, the non-linearity being due to
the inter-particle interaction and emerging in the form of a non-linear self-
interaction term (a cubic non-linearity, for typical two-body interactions)
in the non-linear Schr¨odinger equation for ϕt.
In shorts, the dynamical
problem consists of the completion of the following diagram, assuming that
the ﬁrst line holds at time t = 0:

(1.9)

There is a vast literature on the rigorous derivation of non-linear Schr¨odinger

equations as the eﬀective equations for the dynamics of a many-body Bose
gas that at time t = 0 displays the asymptotic factorisation (1.7). It covers
diﬀerent space dimensions (d = 1, 2, 3), a wide range of local singulari-
ties and long-distance decays for the inter-particle interactions, and various
types of scaling limits in the many-body Hamiltonian HN . We refer to the
reviews [14, 15, 1] for a comprehensive outlook, remarking that this problem
has involved a variety of approaches and techniques from analysis, operator
theory, kinetic theory, and probability.

for an explicit determination of the limit N → ∞ in γ(1)

Let us emphasize that in the lack (so far) of a rigorous control of the
asymptotics (1.7) in a genuine thermodynamic limit, it is customary to
investigate and reproduce it in an ad hoc scaling limit in which the N -body
Hamiltonian is suitably re-scaled with N , thus making the actual inter-
particle interaction N -dependent. This artifact on the one hand allows one
N , while on the other
hand it preserves at any N an amount of relevant physical features of the
system and of its Hamiltonian, among which the property that kinetic and
potential energy remain of the same order so that the interaction is still
visible in the limit, as well as certain dilution properties of the system and
short-range features of the interaction. Typical relevant scaling limits are
those in which the two-body potential V that models the interaction among

4

particles is replaced by a N -dependent two-body potential

VN (x) = N 3β−1V (N βx) ,

β ∈ [0, 1]

(1.10)

(here x = xi − xj is the relative coordinate between particle i and particle
j). The regime β = 0 is the mean-ﬁeld regime, whereas β = 1 gives the
so-called Gross-Pitaevskii scaling regime. We refer to [5] for an extended
discussion.

Coming now to the problem we intend to study, let us mention that
a large amount of theoretical and experimental studies in the dynamics of
Bose gases involve the interaction among two or more samples, each of which
is in a condensate (see [13, Section 12.11] and the references therein). These
conﬁgurations are usually realised using atoms occupying diﬀerent hyperﬁne
states [8, 16] or also diﬀerent atoms [7]. In either case the particles of the
two samples must be considered as diﬀerent species and one then refers
to such a system as a mixture of condensates. For mixtures one has the
additional possibility of producing transitions between the two components,
typically by applying an external oscillating magnetic ﬁeld tuned close to the
hyperﬁne splitting, which gives rise to a new variety of physical phenomena.
In suitable circumstances condensation is robust enough to be preserved in
time, each condensate keeping its own individuality, even in the presence of
a signiﬁcant transfer of atoms from one state to the other.

Physical arguments corroborated by experimental data show that to a
very good approximation the eﬀective dynamics of the mixture is described
by a system of two coupled non-linear Schr¨odinger equations, the coupling
among them accounting for how each of the two condensates aﬀect the evo-
lution of the other. The rich variety of phases exhibited by the mixture is
also well described in terms of the sign and the magnitude of the eﬀective
couplings appearing in the non-linear system [13, Section 12.11]. In analogy
to the rigorous derivation of the eﬀective evolution equation from the quan-
tum dynamics of a condensate, we are therefore interested in reproducing
the eﬀective evolution equations for the mixture dynamics.

To this aim, we shall study a large three-dimensional system consisting
of two distinguishable populations of identical bosons, with two-body in-
teractions among particles of the same species and of diﬀerent species. We
also allow for the possibility of an external electro-magnetic ﬁeld coupled
with the particles, by means of a conﬁning potential in case of a mixture
in a trap or an external magnetic potential. We will assume that at time
t = 0 condensation occurs in both components and we will consider the
quantum evolution of this mixture. As we shall discuss in Sections 2, 3, and
4, where the model will be set up, the appropriate language to formulate
the assumption of condensation and to conveniently monitor the many-body
dynamics is the generalisation of the notion of reduced density matrix for a
Bose gas with two distinguishable components. The eﬀective dynamics will

5

then emerge in a scheme that doubles (1.9) in a suitable sense: this is our
main result, presented in Section 2.

On a more technical level, we ﬁnd that several among the many alterna-
tive techniques developed so far for the (one-component) dynamical prob-
lem (1.9) can be conveniently adapted to approach the multiple-component
setting, with an amount of non-trivial modiﬁcations that depend on the con-
sidered techniques. In this work we employ a particularly robust and ver-
satile method, invented and reﬁned in a recent series of papers by P. Pickl
[10, 11, 12], with the contribution of A. Knowles [3], which monitors how
the displacement γ(1)
N,t − |ϕtihϕt| changes with time by means of an ad hoc
“counting” of the amount of particles in the many-body state γN,t that
occupy the one-body state ϕt. A number of tools and estimates that are
crucial for this approach are reviewed in Appendix A. Such a “counting”
method has the virtue of being based on a few key algebraic steps that only
involve the potential part of the Hamiltonian, and the estimates that then
follow do not concern the diﬀerential part of the operator.
In Section 5,
where we prove our main result, we discuss the non-trivial adaptation that
we developed for Pickl’s method in the multi-component setting.

One last comment is about our treatment of the problem within the
mean-ﬁeld approximation. As our primary goal is to give evidence of the
mechanism by which the many-body Schr¨odinger dynamics for an initial
mixture of condensates give rise to an eﬀective dynamics of coupled non-
linear equations for the persistence of condensation in each component, we
found it instructive to place our discussion in the technically easiest frame-
work, the mean ﬁeld. As discussed in Section 4, in order to derive the
eﬀective dynamics actually expected in a regime of almost zero tempera-
ture and high dilution one has to adopt the more realistic Gross-Pitaevskii
scaling. Given the high versatility of Pickl’s method, that has been proved
to be successful also for the Gross-Pitaevskii scaling [10, 12], the results of
our multi-component analysis too can be proved to hold also for in such a
(technically more diﬃcult) scheme.

On the other hand, Pickl’s method is somewhat rigid in the sense that it
only applies to a very speciﬁc indicator of condensation, namely the quantity
α(k1,k2)
– see (3.3) below. It does not give access to other relevant informa-
N1,N2
tion such as the control of the ﬂuctuations around the emergent eﬀective
dynamics: we point out that this complementary aspect of the present anal-
ysis is the object of a parallel study by one of us in collaboration with G. De
Oliveira [2], so that the two works are in fact part of a uniﬁed project.

Notation. Essentially all the notation adopted here is standard, and we
defer to Subsection 5.1 the introduction of an ad hoc notation for the proof of
our main result. Let us only emphasize the following. As customary, by “.”
we shall mean inequalities with a universal constant as an overall pre-factor,
otherwise the dependence of the constants on other quantities of interest will

6

be declared. Scalar products and norms in the considered Hilbert spaces will
only be explicitly indexed whenever the underlying Hilbert space is not ev-
ident from the context or when we want to emphasize it. In the same spirit
we shall deal with the identity operator 1. We shall also adopt the custom-
ary convention to distinguish the operator domain and the form domain of
any given self-adjoint operator H by means of the notation D(H) vs D[H].
When taking the trace of an operator, suitable subscripts will be occasion-
ally added, such as Trh or Trh⊗2, in order to clarify the underlying Hilbert
space, while unambiguously symbols like TrN −k will denote the partial trace
map.

2 Model and main results

2.1 Many-body and one-body picture and condensate mix-

ture

For N1, N2 ∈ N we consider the Hilbert spaces

HN1,N2 := HN1 ⊗ HN2

= L2(R3N1, dx1 ··· dxN1) ⊗ L2(R3N2, dy1 ··· dyN2) ,

HN1,N2,sym := HN1,sym ⊗ HN2,sym

= L2

sym(R3N1, dx1 ··· dxN1) ⊗ L2

sym(R3N2, dy1 ··· dyN2)

(2.1)

(2.2)

where HN1,N2 (resp., HN,sym) is the N -body (resp. N -body bosonic) Hilbert
space introduced in (1.2) built upon the one-body Hilbert space h = L2(R3).
An element Ψ of HN1,N2,sym is a square-integrable function with two distin-
guishable sets of variables and

Ψ(x1, . . . , xN1; y1, . . . , yN2)

is invariant under exchange of any two x-variables or any two y-variables,
with no overall permutation symmetry among the two sets of variables. The
same double bosonic symmetry is induced on the density matrices acting on
HN1,N2,sym.
The states of HN1,N2,sym describe systems consisting of N1 identical
bosons of the species A and N2 identical bosons of the (diﬀerent) species
B. We want to focus on those states where condensation occurs in both
species. For concreteness one may think of the special case of a density
matrix γN1 ⊗ γN2 on HN1,N2,sym = HN1,sym ⊗ HN2,sym where for j = 1, 2
γNj ,sym is a bosonic density matrix on HNj that exhibits complete conden-
sation in the asymptotic sense (1.7). For a generic density matrix γN1,N2 on
HN1,N2,sym the assumption of double condensation has a natural formulation
in terms of the double partial trace realised by doubling (i.e., tensoring) the

7

map TrN −1 discussed in (1.3)-(1.5). This leads us to introduce the “double”
reduced density matrix

γ(1,1)
N1,N2

= TrN1−1 ⊗ TrN2−1 γN1,N2

(2.3)

associated with γN1,N2, clearly a density matrix on h ⊗ h = L2(R3, dx) ⊗
L2(R3, dy). The operation in (2.3) amounts to tracing out N1 − 1 degrees
of freedom of type A and N2 − 1 degrees of freedom of type B from γN1,N2.
Explicitly, for a pure state (i.e, a normalised function) ΨN1,N2 ∈ HN1,N2,sym
the associated γ(1,1)
N1,N2

has integral kernel

(2.4)

is neither factorised as a product of two density matrices

In general γ(1,1)

on h ⊗ h nor with rank one.
Instead of averaging out all but one particles for each species, one could
also think of controlling a small portion of each component of the system
that corresponds to an arbitrary number k1 6 N1 of A-particles and k2 6 N2
of B-particles, thus tracing out Nj − kj degrees of freedom, j = 1, 2, from
γN1,N2. Deﬁnitions (2.3)-(2.4) are then modiﬁed straightforwardly so as to
deﬁne the (k1, k2)-reduced density matrix γ(k1,k2)
on the space Hk1,k2. This is
N1,N2
the appropriate marginal to study the particle correlations. Another relevant
indicator is obtained by tracing out from the many-body state all the degrees
of freedom of one component, and all but one of the other component, thus
ending up with γ(1,0)
, that are density matrices on the one-
N1,N2
body space h. In Section 3 we develop a more systematic discussion on the
marginals γ(k1,k2)
, their algebra, and an amount of useful bounds for them.
N1,N2
In full analogy with the corresponding deﬁnition for a one-component
condensate, one says that the state γN1,N2 on HN1,N2,sym exhibits con-
densation for both species of particles (that is, a two-component mixture
BEC), with condensate functions u and v (two normalised one-body wave-
functions), if for the associated reduced density matrix one has

N2→∞

= |u ⊗ vihu ⊗ v| = |uihu| ⊗ |vihv| .

(2.5)

As for (1.7), the limit in (2.5) is of thermodynamic type. It expresses, in the
interpretation of occupation numbers discussed in Section 1, the idea that
the actual many-body state has the double-condensate form u⊗N1 ⊗ v⊗N2,
although the vanishing of γ(1,1)
N1,N2 − |u ⊗ vihu ⊗ v| is much weaker than the
vanishing of kΨN1,N2 − u⊗N1 ⊗ v⊗N2k.

8

Observe that the distinguishability of the two species reﬂects into a pre-
cise ordering in the product u ⊗ v ∈ h ⊗ h of the two condensate functions.
Thus, even in the case u = v (as elements in L2(R3)), the double condensa-
tion γ(1,1)
N1,N2 ≈ |u⊗uihu⊗u| expresses the fact that each component undergoes
BEC with the same spatial proﬁle of the condensate: the two condensates
then sit on top of each other, while the two species remain distinguishable.
allows for a simultaneous control of BEC for each species,

2.2 Double-component Hamiltonian

Let us now come to the dynamical model we intend to study. First of all,
we introduce two one-particle Hamiltonians h1 and h2 on h, one for each
species. We have in mind for concreteness two non-relativistic Schr¨odinger
operators with given external magnetic and electric potentials, namely

h1 = −(∇x − iA1(x))2 + U1(x) ,
h2 = −(∇y − iA2(y))2 + U2(y) , (2.7)
for suitable measurable functions Aj : R3 → R3 (magnetic potentials) and
Uj : R3 → R (trapping potentials), j = 1, 2, or their pseudo-relativistic
version

hj = q1 − (∇x − iAj(x))2 + Uj(x) ,

j = 1, 2 .

We then consider a model for N1 identical bosons of one species and N2
identical bosons of another species, in which each particle of the ﬁrst (resp.,
of the second) species is subject to the one-body Hamiltonian h1 (resp., h2)
and is coupled with the other particles of the same species via a two-body
potential V1 : R3 → R (resp., V2 : R3 → R), plus an additional inter-species
two-body potential V12 : R3 → R that couples the two components of the
mixture.
We consider the mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian for this system, namely the

acting on HN1,N2. In (2.8) and throughout this work, we adopt the following
compact notation: if T is an operator acting only on one of the two factors of
HN1,N2 and we need to consider it as an operator on the whole HN1,N2 with
trivial action on the other factor, we shall denote T ⊗ 1 (resp., 1⊗ T ) as T A
(resp., T B). Clearly T A and SB commute for any single-sector operators T
and S. Thus, if V12 ≡ 0, then HN1,N2 consists of the sum of two (commuting)
Hamiltonians, one for each species.
As we intend to study the quantum evolution governed by HN1,N2 in the
limit of very large N1 and N2, keeping the ratio N1/N2 (asymptotically)
constant and non-zero, it is easily seen that the mean-ﬁeld pre-factors N −1
1 ,
N −1
2 , and (N1 + N2)−1 inserted in front of the potential terms ensure that
in this limit the kinetic and the potential part of the Hamiltonian remain
comparable. Indeed, there are N1 + N2 kinetic terms and 1
2 (N1 + N2)(N1 +
N2−1) potential terms in HN1,N2, however the mean-ﬁeld pre-factors reduce
the order of the potential energy to

There are of course other choices that would preserve the mean-ﬁeld char-
acter of the Hamiltonian, for example a common pre-factor (N1 + N2)−1
in front of all potential terms, or a pre-factor (N1N2)−1/2 in front of the
mixed interaction term. In Section 4 we will show that our choice in (2.8)
is the physically meaningful one, for it yields the physically correct eﬀective
dynamics.

We also remark that HN1,N2, albeit not factorised (unless V12 ≡ 0),
maps HN1,N2,sym into itself, because of its permutation symmetry sepa-
rately in each set of variables. Therefore, given a density matrix γN1,N2
on HN1,N2,sym, i.e., a many-body state that is bosonic for each species of
particles, its evolution e−itHN1 ,N2 γN1,N2eitHN1 ,N2 along the dynamics gener-
ated by HN1,N2 remains a density matrix on HN1,N2,sym. In this evolution
the number of particles of each kind is constant, there is an inter-species
interaction (V12) but no transfer of particles among the two populations.

2.3 Asymptotic limit and eﬀective dynamics

As discussed in the Introduction, if the system is prepared at time t = 0 in a
state γN1,N2 where (complete) BEC occurs in both components, one expects
that

• condensation persists also at later times for the quantum dynamics

generated by HN1,N2,

• and the evolution of the two condensate functions is governed by a

system of two coupled non-linear Schr¨odinger equations.

In this work we prove this fact in the sense of the reduced density matrices.
What equations have to be expected can be seen by means of several
heuristic arguments. We discuss them in detail in Section 4. To give a
sketch here of the ‘formal’ derivation, let us ﬁx ﬁrst of all the precise sense
of the double limit N1 → ∞, N2 → ∞. We want the two population
numbers to remain comparable when they become arbitrarily large, so we
assume that there are two constants c1, c2 > 0 such that

Nj

lim

N1→∞
N2→∞

= cj

(j = 1, 2) ,

(2.9)

that is, the ratio N1/N2 is assumed to be asymptotically constant. From
now on, by limN1,N2→∞ we shall mean a limit under the constraint (2.9).

To see formally the emergence of the eﬀective dynamics it is enough to

make the Ansatz

lim

e−itHN1 ,N2 (u⊗N1

) = u⊗N1

⊗ v⊗N2

for some time-dependent functions ut and vt in h, given u0 and v0 at time
t = 0. This, of course, cannot be true at ﬁnite N1, N2, owing to the presence
of the mixed interaction potential V12 in HN1,N2, still, one can compute the
limit energy-per-particle functional

and then determine, by taking the variations of E[ut, vt], the equations that
ut and vt must satisfy in order to preserve the value of this energy in time.
Alternatively, one can re-write the initial value problem for many-body
Schr¨odinger equation

( i∂tΨN1,N2,t = HN1,N2ΨN1,N2,t

this decouples the equation for γ(1,1)

the corresponding equations for ut and vt. We work out these formal calcu-
lations in Section 4.

What one ﬁnds is the system

i∂tut = h1ut + (V1 ∗ |ut|2)ut + c2(V12 ∗ |vt|2)ut
i∂tvt = h2vt + (V2 ∗ |vt|2)vt + c1(V12 ∗ |ut|2)vt

(2.10)

of two coupled non-linear Schr¨odinger equations of Hartree type, in the
two unknowns ut and vt, with initial condition ut=0 = u0 and vt=0 = v0.
Observe in the ﬁrst equation of (2.10) the two self-interaction terms: the
ﬁrst, (V1 ∗ |ut|2)ut, accounts for the interaction of an A-particle with the
eﬀective potential due to the presence of the other particles of the same
species around it, the second, c2(V12∗|vt|2)ut accounts for the analog eﬀective
interaction of the A-particle with the B-particles. Same considerations for
the second equation in (2.10). The weights c1 and c2 adjust the magnitude
of each inter-species self-interaction term with respect to the the relative
ratio of each population in terms of the total number of particles.

It can be argued that, within the mean-ﬁeld scheme, (2.10) is the cor-
rect system of evolution equations for the eﬀective dynamics of a condensate
mixture.
Indeed, it is the mean-ﬁeld version of the system of non-linear
Schr¨odinger equations that physical theoretical heuristics produce, in ex-
traordinary agreement with the experimental data, when the mixture is
modelled with the more realistic assumption of strong short-scale interac-
tions and high dilution. This is another point that we discuss in detail in in
Section 4.

2.4 Assumptions and main theorem

We shall work under the following set of assumptions.

(A1) The one-particle Hamiltonians h1 and h2 are self-adjoint and semi-
bounded below on h.
It is not restrictive to assume both of them
positive. This implies that for any N1, N2 ∈ N the free (kinetic) part
in the Hamiltonian (2.8), namely

H (0)

N1,N2

:=

(h1)A

i +

(h2)B

N2Xr=1

(2.11)

is self-adjoint and positive on HN1,N2, and that the corresponding form
domain D[H (0)
hΨ, ΦiD[H (0)

] is a Hilbert space w.r.t. the scalar product

= h(1 + H (0)

)1/2Ψ, (1 + H (0)

)1/2Φi .

(2.12)

N1,N2

N1,N2

N1,N2

]

N1,N2

(A2) The potentials V1, V2, and V12 are real-valued even functions satisfying

Vα ∈ Lrα(R3) + Lsα(R3)
for some 2 6 rα 6 sα 6 +∞

,

α ∈ {1, 2, 12} .

(2.13)

(A3) For all N1, N2 ∈ N the Hamiltonian HN1,N2 (2.8) is self-adjoint and

semi-bounded below on HN1,N2, and D[HN1,N2] ⊂ D[H (0)

N1,N2

].

(A4) The initial value problem consisting of the system (2.10) with initial
condition u(0) = u0 and v(0) = v0 for given functions u0 ∈ D[h1] and
v0 ∈ D[h2] has a unique global-in-time solution

(u, v) ∈ C(R, X) ∩ C 1(R,D[h1]∗ ⊕ D[h2]∗)

(2.14)

where
X := (D[h1] ∩ Lmax{br1,br12}(R3)) ⊕ (D[h2] ∩ Lmax{br2,br12}(R3)) (2.15)

α ∈ {1, 2, 12} .

(2.16)

We remark that assumptions (A1)-(A4) above are cast in an “opera-
tional” form that is immediately ready to be exploited in our proofs, whereas
the precise constraints that they impose on the potentials A1, A2, U1, U2, V1, V2, V12
are left in a somewhat implicit form – observe, for instance that a priori con-
ditions (A3) and (A4) select a sub-class of potentials from condition (A2). It
is however easy to recognise that (A1)-(A4) cover a wide range of practically
relevant cases (analogously to what observed already in [3, Section 3.2]), in-
cluding for example the inter-particle Coulomb interactions Vα(x) = cα|x|−1,
α ∈ {1, 2, 12} for ordinary one-body Hamiltonians h1 = h2 = −∆.

We can now state our main result.

Theorem 2.1. Consider a two-species bosonic system under assumptions
(A1)-(A4) above. Suppose, at time t = 0, ΨN1,N2 ∈ D[HN1,N2] ∩ HN1,N2,sym
with kΨN1,N2k2 = 1, and (u0, v0) ∈ X (the space deﬁned in (2.15)) with
ku0k2 = kv0k2 = 1. Correspondingly, for t ∈ R let ΨN1,N2(t) := e−itHN1 ,N2 ΨN1,N2
be the unique solution in C(R,D[HN1,N2] ∩ HN1,N2,sym) to the many-body
Schr¨odinger equation

i∂tΨN1,N2(t) = HN1,N2ΨN1,N2(t) ,

ΨN1,N2(0) = ΨN1,N2 ,

(2.17)

and let (ut, vt) be the unique solution in C(R, X) (the space (2.14)-(2.15)
of assumption (A4)) to the initial value problem consisting of the Hartree
system (2.10) with initial condition (u0, v0) at t = 0. Let γ(1,1)
(t) be the
N1,N2
double reduced density matrix associated with ΨN1,N2(t), given by (2.4), and
deﬁne

(t) := 1 −(cid:10)ut ⊗ vt , γ(1,1)

(2.18)
Assume further that in the limit N1, N2 → ∞ the two populations have given
asymptotic ratios c1, c2 > 0, according to (2.9). Then there exists a constant
κ = κ(c1, c2) > 0, such that

(t) ut ⊗ vt(cid:11) .

We are clearly interested in applying Theorem 2.1 to the case where the
initial many-body state of the mixture displays double condensation in the
orbitals u0 and v0, in the sense of the discussion of Subsection 2.1 and of
the asymptotics (2.5) therein. This, together with the estimates of Section
3 for the indicators of convergence, leads to the following:

Corollary 2.1. If, in addition to the hypothesis of Theorem 2.1, the se-
quence of initial data (ΨN1,N2)N1,N2 satisﬁes

α(1,1)
N1,N2

(0) 6 K

(2.20)

for some constant K that depends only on the population fractions c1 and
c2, then ∀t ∈ R one has

(2.22)

Corollary 2.1 provides therefore a quantitative proof of the persistence
of the double condensation in the mixture at any ﬁnite time. Observe that
no matter how faster than (N1 + N2)−1 is the asymptotic BEC (2.20) at
t = 0, the bound (2.19) always gives at later times a rate of convergence of
magnitude (N1 + N2)−1 in (2.21). We emphasize also that the exponential
deterioration in time of all the above controls (2.19), (2.21), (2.22) of BEC
along the time evolution is certainly non optimal and is rather a consequence
of the Gr¨onwall-type estimate at the basis of the proof of Theorem 2.1.

2.5 Further consequences and remarks

Controls in the energy space. By replacing assumptions (A2) and (A4) above
with

condition u(0) = u0 and v(0) = v0 for given functions u0 ∈ D[h1] and
v0 ∈ D[h2] has a unique global-in-time solution

(u, v) ∈ C(R,D[h1] ⊕ D[h2]) ∩ C 1(R,D[h1]∗ ⊕ D[h2]∗)

(2.24)

then Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.1 hold with

D[h1] + kvτk2

Indeed, assumptions (2.23) take the role of Lemma 5.1 below and our proof
remains virtually unchanged.

Control of a fraction of each condensate.

It follows straightforwardly
from the properties of the indicators of condensation discussed in Lemma
3.2 of Section 3 below that the conclusion of Corollary 2.1 implies also

which is interpreted as the control of the persistence in time of condensation
for o(Nj) particles of the j-th species, j = 1, 2.

More singular potentials. Although we are not interested in discussing
in full generality the class of interaction potentials that can be dealt with by
the present method, it is worth remarking that with a moderate additional
eﬀort one can adapt the proof of Theorem 2.1 (in the spirit of [3, Section 5])
so as to include potentials with stronger singularities than those admitted
by Assumptions (A1)-(A4) above.

3 Partial marginals and indicators of condensation

We have already introduced in Subsection 2.1 the notion of double reduced
density matrix γ(k1,k2)
associated with a given state γN1,N2 for a mixture
N1,N2
of N1 + N2 particles and relative to a choice of kj 6 Nj particles of the
j-th species, j = 1, 2, see equations (2.3)-(2.4) and the discussion thereafter.
In this Section we elaborate further on these indicators and on equivalent
quantitative characterisations of asymptotic BEC.

Explicitly, for a pure state (a normalised function) ΨN1,N2 ∈ HN1,N2,sym

the associated marginal

γ(k1,k2)
N1,N2

= TrN1−k1 ⊗ TrN2−k2 |ΨN1,N2ihΨN1,N2|

(3.1)

has integral kernel

(3.2)

As long as k1, k2 > 1, γ(k1,k2)
is a density matrix acting on Hk1,k2,sym. In
N1,N2
the extremal cases, (3.1)-(3.2) above deﬁne reduced density matrices γ(k1,0)
N1,N2
and γ(0,k2)
acting, respectively, on the single-species bosonic spaces Hk1 and
N1,N2
Hk2, that is, all the degrees of freedom of one of the two components are
traced out.
For given one-body orbitals u, v ∈ h with kuk = kvk = 1, which are
going to play the role of condensate functions for the two component of the
mixture, and for given kj 6 Nj, j = 1, 2, we deﬁne

and

N1,N2

α(k1,k2)
N1,N2

N1,N2

:= 1 −(cid:10)u⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k1 , γ(k1,k2)

u⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k2(cid:11)
N1,N2 − |u⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k2ihu⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k2|(cid:12)(cid:12) .

The scalar product in (3.3) and the trace in (3.4) are taken in the Hilbert
space Hk1,k2.

Both these indicators measure a displacement of the marginal γ(k1,k1)
N1,N2
from |u⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k2ihu⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k2|, which is the (k1, k2)-reduced density ma-
trix relative to the purely factorised (N1 + N2)-body state u⊗N1 ⊗ v⊗N2. As
already discussed in Subsection 2.1, their vanishing for large N1, N2 has the
natural interpretation of occurrence of double (simultaneous) condensation

(3.3)

(3.4)

16

for the two components of the mixture. This is in complete analogy to the
indicators of condensation adopted for the one-component case (see equa-
tions (1.7)-(1.8) and the following comments in the Introduction), which in
the present notation are precisely α(k1,0)
relative to the ﬁrst
N1,N2
component (and the analogs for the second component).

and R(k1,0)
N1,N2

We discuss the properties of such indicators in these two Lemmas and
in the following observations. For notational convenience we omit the sub-
scripts N1, N2.

Lemma 3.1. For the quantities deﬁned in (3.3) for k1, k2 ∈ {0, 1}, one has
(3.5)

α(1,0) 6 α(1,1) ,

α(0,1) 6 α(1,1)

and

α(1,1) 6 α(1,0) + α(0,1) .

(3.6)

Lemma 3.2. For the quantities deﬁned in (3.3)-(3.4) for kj ∈ {1, . . . , Nj},
j = 1, 2, one has

α(k1,k2) 6 R(k1,k2) 6 2pα(k1,k2)
α(k1,k2) 6 max{k1, k2} · α(1,1) .

(3.7)

(3.8)

In this work we are mainly concerned with the α-indicators, that mea-
sure the displacement between the maximal possible value 1 and the expec-
tation of the reduced density matrix on the factorised state. The apparently
stronger trace norm displacement (the R-indicators) turns out to be equiva-
lent to the former, in view of (3.7). Lemma 3.1 shows that for the control of
the double condensation, simultaneously in each component, one can equiv-
alently monitor the vanishing of α(1,1) or the vanishing of α(1,0) and α(0,1).
Lemma 3.2 shows in addition that the vanishing of α(1,1) or of higher order
α-indicators are also equivalent, with a deterioration (the factor max{k1, k2}
in (3.8)) that depends on the size of the subsystem of particles in each com-
ponent on which one monitors the absence of correlation, that is, the pure
factorisation and hence the occurrence of condensation.

Proof of Lemma 3.1. If (vn)∞
that v1 = v, one has

n=1 is an orthonormal basis of h = L2(R3) such

hu ⊗ v , γ(1,1) u ⊗ vih⊗2 6

∞Xn=1
hu ⊗ vn , γ(1,1) u ⊗ vnih⊗2 = hu , γ(1,0)uih

where the inequality is due to the positivity of γ(1,1) and in the following
identity we used the deﬁnition of partial trace. This shows that α(1,0) 6

17

α(1,1), and analogously α(0,1) 6 α(1,1). To prove (3.6), we exploit the posi-
tivity of the projections 1 − |uihu| and 1 − |vihv|, and hence of their tensor
product: one ﬁnds

0 6 Trh⊗2(cid:2) γ(1,1)(1h − |uihu|) ⊗ (1h − |vihv|)(cid:3)
= Trh⊗2(cid:2) γ(1,1)(1h − |uihu|) ⊗ 1h(cid:3) + Trh⊗2(cid:2) γ(1,1)
− Trh⊗2(cid:2) γ(1,1)(1h⊗2 − |uihu| ⊗ |vihv|)(cid:3)
= α(1,0) + α(0,1) − α(1,1)
and the conclusion follows.

1h ⊗ (1h − |vihv|)(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 3.2. Inequalities (3.7) are established precisely as in the
one-component case, since here one only deals with the rank-one projection
|u⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k2ihu⊗k1 ⊗ v⊗k2| and the density matrix γ(k1,k2) on the (k1 + k2)-
body space Hk1,k2, with no reference to the two-component structure or to
the numbers k1, k2 – see, e.g., [3, Lemma 2.3] (the constant 2 in the second
inequality in (3.7) is an easy improvement of the constant 2√2 obtained in
[3, Lemma 2.3]). As for (3.8), one ﬁrst repeats component-wise the very
same argument that allows for a control of the k-th marginal in terms of the
(k − 1)-th marginal precisely as in the one-component case [3, Lemma 2.1],
thus obtaining

α(k1,k2) 6 α(k1−1,k2−1) + α(1,1) .

By iteration, and supposing for example k1 < k2, one gets

α(k1,k2) 6 k1α(1,1) + α(0,k2−k1) .

In turn, for the one-component (k2 − k1)-marginal α(0,k2−k1) the standard
one-component argument [3, Lemma 2.1] yields

α(0,k2−k1) 6 (k2 − k1) α(0,1)

and by Lemma 3.1 α(0,1) 6 α(1,1). By combining these inequalities,

α(k1,k2) 6 k1α(1,1) + (k2 − k1) α(0,1) 6 k2 α(1,1)

which proves (3.8).

4 Mean-ﬁeld scaling for a two-component mixture

The purpose of this Section is to justify the mean-ﬁeld scaling factors chosen
in (2.8) for the many-body Hamiltonian HN1,N2. It was already remarked
after (2.8) that there is large freedom in ﬁnding N1, N2-dependent pre-factors
that ensure that the kinetic and the potential part of HN1,N2 remain of the
same order as N1, N2 → ∞. One then has to make a choice driven by

18

physical considerations, given the asymptotic fractions c1 and c2 of the two
populations of particles.

We focus ﬁrst on the expected system (2.10) of non-linear Schr¨odinger
It is a well familiar
equations for the eﬀective dynamics of the mixture.
fact in the quest for eﬀective evolution equations of many-body quantum
dynamics that performing a mean-ﬁeld scaling in the Hamiltonian produces
at the eﬀective level non-linear Schr¨odinger equations of Hartree type, that
is, with “non-local” non-linearities of the form (V ∗ |u|2)u – see, e.g., [1,
Chapter 2]. Realistic interaction potentials have strong magnitude on a short
range and as opposite to the mean-ﬁeld picture each particle interacts with
the neighbouring others on a short scale only: the non-linearity expected
in the eﬀective dynamics is then “local”, namely of the form g|u|2u. For
the two-component condensate mixture under consideration, an amount of
physical heuristics and experimental observations [13, Section 12.11] show
that the eﬀective dynamics is governed by the system

i∂tut = h1ut + g1N1|ut|2ut + g12N2|vt|2ut
i∂tvt = h2vt + g2N2|vt|2vt + g12N1|ut|2vt

(4.1)

as an accurate approximation in the regime of ultra-low temperature, high
dilution, and large N1, N2. In (4.1) the couplings g1, g2, g12 are, in suitable
units, the two-body scattering lengths of the corresponding particle-particle

interactions and the functions √N1 u, √N2 v, with kuk2 = kvk2 = 1, repre-

sent the so-called “order parameters” of the two components of the mixture.
For a mathematical derivation of (4.1) one goes through a suitable scal-
ing of the interaction potentials, and hence of the couplings g1(N1, N2),
g2(N1, N2), g12(N1, N2), as N1, N2 → ∞, so as to have asymptotically con-
stant couplings

g1(N1, N2)N1 → γ1 ,
g12(N1, N2)N2 → D1 ,

g2(N1, N2)N1 → γ2
g12(N1, N2)N1 → D2

(4.2)

in a limiting, N1, N2-independent version of (4.1). It is then immediate to
see that (4.2), under the constraint N1/N2 → c1/c2, imposes D1 = γ12c2
and D2 = γ12c1 for some constant γ12 > 0 and hence the scalings

(4.3)
Based on the deﬁnition of scattering length for short-range potentials [4,
Appendix C], it is easy to see that the re-scaling (4.3) of the scattering
lengths g1, g2, g12 is reproduced by scaling the interaction potentials as

V2(x) = N 2
V1(x) = N 2
V12(x) = (N1 + N2)2V12((N1 + N2)x) ,

1V1(N1x) ,

2V2(N2x) ,

(4.4)

19

for ﬁxed potentials V1, V2, V12 with scattering length, respectively, γ1, γ2,
γ12: this is precisely the Gross-Pitaevskii scaling, namely the case β = 1 in
(1.10). In this scaling, the non-linear eﬀective system to be derived takes
therefore the form

i∂tut = h1ut + γ1|ut|2ut + c2 γ12|vt|2ut
i∂tvt = h2vt + γ2|vt|2vt + c1 γ12|ut|2vt .

(4.5)

As in the present work we put emphasis on the mechanism for the emer-
gence of a non-linear eﬀective description and for this we content ourselves
to discuss the mean-ﬁeld problem, (4.5) has to be converted to its mean-
ﬁeld form: using that the Born approximation for the scattering length is

γα = R Vα, α ∈ {1, 2, 12}, we see that for a formal short-range potential
Vα(x) = γαδ(x) the counterpart of the non-linearities γα|f|2g has the form
(Vα ∗ |f|2)g. The mean-ﬁeld version of (4.5) is therefore the Hartree system
(2.10). This also indicates that the mean-ﬁeld version of the Gross-Pitaevskii
scaling (4.4) for the interaction potentials is, in view of (1.10),

V1(x) = N −1
V12(x) = (N1 + N2)−1V12(x) ,

1 V1(x) ,

(4.6)

which accounts for the actual mean-ﬁeld pre-factors chosen in (2.8).

We ﬁnd it instructive to present two alternative arguments for the emer-
gence of the choice (4.6) in the many-body Hamiltonian. In the ﬁrst one we
allow for generic mean-ﬁeld pre-factors

Vα(x) = mα(N1, N2)V(x) ,

α ∈ {1, 2, 12} ,

(4.7)

in the expression (2.8) for the many-body Hamiltonian HN1,N2 and we com-
pute the asymptotics of the energy per particle for the purely double con-
densate state with orbitals u and v, thus ﬁnding

E [u, v] =

(4.8)

where we set

(N1 + N2) · mα ,

α ∈ {1, 2, 12} .

(4.9)

The energy E has to be conserved along the time evolution generated by
HN1,N2: making the Ansatz that the pure factorisation of the initial state

20

is preserved in time, an easy computation shows that for smooth enough
solutions (ut, vt) to the system

i∂tut = h1ut + c1k1(V1 ∗ |ut|2)ut + c2k12(V12 ∗ |vt|2)ut
i∂tvt = h2vt + c2k2(V2 ∗ |vt|2)vt + c1k12(V12 ∗ |ut|2)vt

one has

d
dt

E [ut, vt] = 0 ,

(4.10)

(4.11)

which makes (4.10) the correct solution for the many-body dynamics under
the formal factorisation Ansatz. The comparison between (4.10) and the
expected (2.10) gives

c1k1 = 1 ,

c2k2 = 1 ,

c2k12 = c2 ,

c1k12 = c1 ,

whence, owing to (4.9),

m1 = N −1

1

,

m2 = N −1

2

,

m12 = (N1 + N2)−1 .

(4.12)

With the choice (4.12), (4.7) reproduces precisely (4.6).

Alternatively, one can check the correctness of the chosen mean-ﬁeld
pre-factors by plugging the formal Ansatz of complete factorisation into the
hierarchy of coupled PDE’s that must be satisﬁed by the reduced marginals
γ(k1,k2)
N1,N2
equation i∂tΨN1,N2(t) = HN1,N2ΨN1,N2(t). This is the so-called BBGKY
hierarchy [1, Chapter 2], that consists of coupled equations for the (k1, k2)-
marginals for each k1 and k2 in {1, . . . , Nj}, the ﬁrst of which is

(t) associated with the solution ΨN1,N2(t) to the many-body Schr¨odinger

With a direct computation one then checks that the formal Ansatz γ(k1,k2)
∞,∞ (t) =
(|utihut|)⊗k1 ⊗ (|vtihvt|)⊗k2 in the limit of inﬁnitely many particles, where
(ut, vt) is a solution to the Hartree system (2.10), produces a solution to
(4.14) and in fact to all the other equations of the inﬁnite BBGKY hierar-
chy.

5 Proof of Theorem 2.1

In this Section we present the proof of our main result, Theorem 2.1, and of
Corollary 2.1. We shall discuss it in various steps.

The proof goes through a suitable modiﬁcation of Pickl’s counting method
for the dynamics of a single-component condensate [3, 10, 11, 12], in order
to deal with the inter-species interaction terms and the new mean-ﬁeld cou-
pling factors. This method is speciﬁcally tailored for the quantity α(1,1)
(t)
N1,N2
and it is designed to control it in terms of its value at t = 0. In fact, what
in an appropriate sense is actually “counted” is, informally speaking, the
number of “bad” particles of each species in the many-body state ΨN1,N2(t)
which are not of the type ut or vt, more precisely which are described by a
one-body orbital orthogonal to ut or vt. The quantity of interest, according
to this interpretation, is therefore the expectation of the single-orbital ob-
servable |ut ⊗ vtihut ⊗ vt| on h ⊗ h on the state ΨN1,N2(t) ∈ HN1,N2,sym, and
hence the quantity

(cid:10) ΨN1,N2(t), (1 − |ut ⊗ vtihut ⊗ vt| ) ΨN1,N2(t)(cid:11) =

= 1 −(cid:10)ut ⊗ vt , γ(1,1)

N1,N2

(t) ut ⊗ vt(cid:11) = α(1,1)

(5.1)

(t) .

N1,N2

In order to obtain the bound (2.19) in Theorem 2.1 we shall establish

the following estimate on the time derivative of α(1,1)

(t):

(5.2)

for some function B(t) that is given in terms of certain norms of the interac-
tion potentials V1, V2, V12 and of the solutions ut, vt to the Hartree system,
and independent of the number of particles. After an integration in time
(5.2) gives

that leads to (2.19).

5.1 Additional notation

N1 + N2(cid:17) eR t

0 B(s)ds

(5.4)

An amount of simpliﬁed notation will be useful from now on.

We shall drop the t-variable and N -subscripts, thus setting Ψ ≡ ΨN1,N2(t)
for the solution to the many-body Schr¨odinger equation, u ≡ ut and v ≡ vt
for the solutions to the Hartree system (2.10), and α(1,1) ≡ α(1,1)
(t) for the
corresponding quantity (5.1). Also, we shall denote the time derivative as
˙α(1,1).

N1,N2

for some j ∈ {1, . . . , N1} or T B

We shall keep the convention T A (resp., T B) for T ⊗ 1 (resp., 1 ⊗ T )
where T is an operator that acts only on one of the two factors of HN1,N2 and
we need to consider it as an operator on the whole HN1,N2 with trivial action
on the other factor. When, in particular, T is a one-particle operator (that
is, T acts on h), the notation T A
for some
j
ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , N2} indicates that we are considering T as acting non-trivially
on the one-body space of the j-th particle of type A or the ℓ-th particle of
type B. In analogy to this convention, we shall write Tij when a two-body
operator T (i.e., an operator on h ⊗ h, meant to be the one-body spaces of
each component) acts on HN1,N2 non-trivially only in the variables xi and yj
of the wave-function Ψ(x1, . . . , xN1; y1, . . . , yN2). Observe that this is clearly
not to be confused with the symbol V12 for the inter-species potential: when
needed, according to the convention above we shall rather write (V12)ij as a
multiplication operator.

ℓ

Henceforth we shall also omit the explicit tensor product notation ⊗: this
will leave product expressions that it will be straightforward to interpret as
tensor products based on the context.

A special notation for a number of relevant one-particle operators will
be convenient. By hu and hv we shall denote the two “one-body non-linear
Hamiltonians”

hu := h1 + V1 ∗ |ut|2 + c2V12 ∗ |vt|2
hv := h2 + V2 ∗ |vt|2 + c1V12 ∗ |ut|2

(5.5)

23

and by pA, pB and qA, qB we shall denote the orthogonal projections

qA := 1 − |utihut|
qB := 1 − |vtihvt| .
Furthermore, we shall soon make use of the shorthands

pA := |utihut| ,
pB := |vtihvt| ,

V u
:= V1 ∗ |ut|2 ,
1
V u
12 := V12 ∗ |ut|2 ,

:= V2 ∗ |vt|2

V v
2
V v
12 := V12 ∗ |vt|2 .

(5.6)

(5.7)

Observe that according to our convention (V u
i denotes the multiplication
operator by the function (V1 ∗ |ut|2)(xi) in the i-th of the variables for the
species A, and so on.
If f ϕ is any of the shorthands (5.7) for some functions f and ϕ, then in

1 )A

terms of the above conventions one has

pA
2 f A

12 pA

2 = pA

2 (f ϕ)A

(5.8)

as an identity of two-body operators acting on the A-sector of the many-
body Hilbert space – here f A
12 is the function f (x1, x2) – and the same holds
for the B-sector. Analogously,

pA

1 = pA
1 = pB

(5.9)

as an identity of mixed-component two-body operators – here f11 is the
function f (x1, y1).

5.2 Estimates on convolutions

As we will systematically need to bound the L∞-norm of functions of the
form V ∗ |φ|2 or V 2 ∗ |φ|2, where V = V1, V2, V12 and φ = ut, vt, we cast two
standard estimates in the following Lemma.
Lemma 5.1. For given r, s such that 2 6 r 6 s 6 ∞ let br and bs be deﬁned

Then, for V ∈ Lr(Rd) + Ls(Rd) and φ ∈ L2(Rd)∩ Lbr(Rd) with kφk2 = 1 one

(5.10)

(5.11)

Proof. By assumption one can split V = V (r) + V (s) with V (r) ∈ Lr(Rd) and
V (s) ∈ Ls(Rd), Then

(cid:13)(cid:13)V ∗ |φ|2(cid:13)(cid:13)∞ 6 kV (r) ∗ |φ|2k∞ + kV (s) ∗ |φ|2k∞

where the second step follows by Young’s inequality and the last step by

(cid:13)(cid:13)V ∗ |φ|2(cid:13)(cid:13)∞ 6 kV kLr+Ls(cid:0)kφkbr + kφkbs(cid:1)

which proves (5.10). Analogously one ﬁnds

(cid:13)(cid:13)V 2 ∗ |φ|2(cid:13)(cid:13)∞ 6 2(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:0)V (r)(cid:1)2 ∗ |φ|2(cid:13)(cid:13)∞ + 2(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:0)V (s)(cid:1)2 ∗ |φ|2(cid:13)(cid:13)∞

using again Young’s inequality in the second step. By taking the inﬁmum

Lr+Ls(cid:0)kφkbr + kφkbs(cid:1)2 .

which proves (5.11).

5.3 Time derivative of α(1,1)

N1,N2(t) and cancellation of the kinetic

terms

We intend to diﬀerentiate in time the quantity α(1,1) written in the form
(5.1), that is,

α(1,1) = hΨ, (1 − pA

1 pB

1 )Ψi .

(5.12)

1 pB

When the time derivative hits the Ψ’s, this produces a commutator
term [HN1,N2, pA
1 ] owing to (2.17), and this term is well deﬁned because
1 pB
pA
1 Ψ ∈ D[HN1,N2] owing to assumptions (A2) and (A4). When instead

the time derivative hits pA
1 ] owing to (2.10), where hu and hv are the operators (5.5). This
1)B, pA
(hv
term too is well deﬁned: indeed, on the one hand Lemma 5.1 together with
assumptions (A2) and (A4) implies that the multiplicative parts of hu and
hv (i.e., the functions V1 ∗ |u|2, V2 ∗ |v|2, V12 ∗ |u|2, and V12 ∗ |v|2) are all
bounded, which in turn implies the boundedness of hu and hv as operators

1 , this produces a commutator term [(hu

sumptions (A3), which makes the expectation hΨ, [(hu

For both j = 1, 2 the constant κj depends only on the population fraction cj.

Proof. We shall focus on CV1, the proof for CV2 is completely analogous. In
fact, since the commutator in the r.h.s. of (5.23) is non-trivial on the ﬁrst
component only, the treatment of CV1 is analogous to the single-component
case. By inserting on both sides of the commutator in (5.23) the identity

(5.26)

one obtains 16 terms; however, owing to Lemma A.3, only those terms
with diﬀerent numbers of q’s on the left and on the right are non-zero (see
the remark after (A.17)). We cast them in the following self-explanatory
notation

CV1 = 2 (pp, qp) + 2 (qp, qq) + (pp, qq) + complex conjugate

5.5 Term containing V12

the symmetry of Ψ:

(5.31)

(5.32)

where the constant κ12 depends only on the population fractions c1 and c2.

Proof. We insert on both sides of the commutator in (5.31) the identity

1 = (pA

1 + qA

1 )(pB

1 + qB
1 )

(5.33)

(observe that, as opposite to (5.26), in (5.33) the insertion involves both
components), which produces 16 terms to estimate. Unlike our previous
bookkeeping (5.27), it is not possible to apply Lemma A.3 in order to identify
a priori those that vanish, because here the p’s and q’s inserted on the left
and on the right are relative to distinct components. We rather group these
terms depending on whether the number of the q’s is the same or not on
both sides, that is,

Λ := (pp, pp) + [(pq, pq) + (qp, qp)] + (qq, qq)

+ [(pq, qp) + complex conjugate ]

and

Ω := (pp, qp) + (qp, qq) + (pp, qq) + (pp, pq) + (pq, qq)

+ complex conjugate

(5.34)

(5.35)

where a self-explanatory notation analogous to (5.27) is used. In Subsections
5.5.1 and 5.5.2 below we shall ﬁnd

|Λ| . kV12kLr12 +Ls12(cid:0)kukbr12 + kukbs12 + kvkbr12 + kvkbs12(cid:1) α(1,1)

(see (5.43) below), for some constant eκ12 that depends on c1 and c2 only,

×(cid:16)α(1,1) +

N1 + N2(cid:17) .

which completes the proof.

reason, upon exchanging the roles of A and B.

The summand (qq, qq) in (5.34) vanishes owing to pq = O, indeed

A Tools exported from the treatment of the single-

component case

We collect in this Appendix a number of tools, needed in the proof of Theo-
rem 2.1, on which the “counting” method is based, quoting their properties
from the previous treatments of the single-component case [3, 10, 11, 12].

The notation is that introduced in Subsection 5.1 as applicable for one

component only. Thus, in particular, we consider the projections

p := |φihφ| ,

q := 1 − |φihφ|

(A.1)

on the one-body Hilbert space h and their realisation pj, qj, j ∈ {1, . . . , N}
as orthogonal projections on the many-body Hilbert space HN = h⊗N , where
φ ∈ h with kφk = 1. Clearly, p + q = 1 and pq = O = [p, q].
Associated to p and q one deﬁnes the family of orthogonal projections
Pk acting on HN , deﬁned by

Pk := Xa∈{0,1}N

Pi ai=k

NYi=1

Pk := O

p1−ai
i

qai
i

if k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N}

(A.2)

otherwise .

Each Pk consists by construction of the sum of all possible N -fold tensor
products of the p’s and the q’s with k factor q. It therefore arises as the

37

k-th term in the expansion of the identity

1 = (p1 + q1)··· (pN + qN ) =

Pk

NXk=0

(A.3)

in powers of q. It is also clear by the commutation properties of the pj’s and
qj’s that

Pk Pℓ = δk,ℓPk .

(A.4)

A relevant role is played by suitable weighted linear combinations of the

Pk’s. To this aim one introduces, associated to any function f : {0, 1, . . . , N} →
C, i.e., any (N + 1)-ple (f (0), . . . , f (N )) ∈ CN +1, the operator

f (k) Pk .

NXk=0

(A.5)

bf :=

As an immediate consequence of (A.4) and of the commutation properties
of the pj’s,

Two convenient choices for the function f shall be

[bf , pj ] = [bf , Pk ] = O ,

[bf ,bg ] = O .

(A.6)

m(k) :=

n(k) := r k

For the operator bm one has

NXk=0

Therefore, if Ψ ∈ HN,sym ≡ (h⊗N )sym, then (A.8) implies

kPk = bm .

(A.8)

(A.9)

(A.10)

(A.11)

hΨ, q1 Ψi = hΨ,bm Ψi .

We thus come to the following useful bounds (see [3, Lemma 3.9]):

Lemma A.1. For any f : {0, . . . , N} → [0, +∞) and any Ψ ∈ HN,sym one
has

hΨ,bf q1 Ψi = hΨ,bf bm Ψi
hΨ,bf q1 q2 Ψi 6

N − 1hΨ,bf bm2 Ψi .

N

A further relevant tool is a modiﬁcation of Lemma A.1 above for the
case when Ψ carries only a partial permutation symmetry. In the present
context this is the case when we consider the two-component many-body
states of the form pA
1 Ψ – see the control of terms of the form (pp, qq)1 in
Subsection 5.5.2. We import the following result from [12, Lemma 4.2]:

38

Lemma A.2. For any f : {0, . . . , N} → [0, +∞) and any Φ ∈ h⊗HN −1,sym
one has

In particular, in the context of Subsection 5.4, the bound (A.12) above

implies

Next to the operators of the form bf , a relevant role in the estimates for
the “counting” method is played by the operators of the formdτnf , where τn

for given n ∈ Z is the operation that produces the shifted function

(τnf )(k) := f (k + n) ,

k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N} .

(A.15)

The following important property holds (see [3, Lemma 3.10]):
Lemma A.3. Let A1···r ≡ A ⊗ 1N −r be an operator on HN ∼= Hr ⊗ HN −r
that acts non-trivially only on the ﬁrst factor Hr, and let Qj, j = 1, 2, be
two orthogonal projections on Hr given by monomials of p’s and q’s, each
with nj factors q and r − nj factors p. Set n := n2 − n1. Then

Q1 A1...r bf Q2 = Q1dτnf A1...r Q2

as an identity of bounded operators on HN (with a tacit identiﬁcation Qj ≡
Qj ⊗ 1N −r).

In fact, as a consequence of the presence of two-body interactions only
in the many-body Hamiltonian HN1,N2, the use of Lemma A.3 is in practice
limited to the case r = 2: formula (A.16) then reads

(A.16)

p1 p2 A12 bf q1 p2 = p1 p2dτ1f A12 q1 p2
p1 p2 A12 bf q1 q2 = p1 p2dτ2f A12 q1 q2
q1 p2 A12 bf q1 q2 = q1 p2dτ1f A12 q1 q2

(A.17)

while in all other cases with equal number of q’s on the left and on the right

we have a commutation of the form ♯1♯2A12 bf ♯1♯2 = ♯1♯2 bf A12 ♯1♯2.
