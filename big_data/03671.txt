HOMOGENEOUS ACTIONS ON THE RANDOM GRAPH

PIERRE FIMA, SOYOUNG MOON, AND YVES STALDER

Abstract. We show that any free product of two inﬁnite countable groups admits a faithful
and homogeneous action on the Random Graph. Moreover, we show the ubiquity of ﬁnitely
generated free dense subgroups of the automorphism group of the Random Graph whose
actions on it have all orbits inﬁnite.

Introduction

The Random Graph (or Rado graph or Erd¨os-R´enyi graph) is the unique, up to isomorphism,
countable inﬁnite graph R having the following property : for any pair of disjoint ﬁnite subsets
(U, V ) of the set of vertices there exists a vertex linked to any vertex in U and not linked to
any vertex in V . Using this property and a model theoretic device called “back-and-forth” one
can show that R is homogeneous : any graph isomorphism between ﬁnite induced subgraphs
can be extended to a graph automorphism of R. Hence, the Random Graph plays the same
role in graph theory as the Uryshon’s space does in metric spaces.

The Random Graph has been popularized by Erd¨os and R´enyi in a serie of papers between
1959 and 1968. They showed [ER63] that if a countable graph is chosen at random, by
selecting edges independently with probability 1
2 from the set of 2-elements subsets of the
vertex set, then almost surely the resulting graph is isomorphic to R. Erd¨os and R´enyi
conclude that this Theorem demolishes the theory of inﬁnite random graphs (however, the
world of ﬁnite random graphs is much less predictable).

Since almost all countable graphs are isomorphic to R, Erd¨os and Renyi did not give an
explicit construction of the Random Graph. However, by using the uniqueness property of R,
it is clear that one may give many diﬀerent explicit constructions. Such an explicit description
was proposed by Rado [Ra64]. The uniqueness property of R may also be used to show many
stability properties (if small changes are made on R then the resulting graph is still isomorphic
to R) and to construct many automorphisms of R as well as group actions on R.

The homogeneity of R means that its automorphism group Aut(R) is large: it acts transi-
tively on vertices, edges and more generally on ﬁnite conﬁgurations of any given isomorphism
type. We will view it as a closed subset of the Polish group (for the topology of pointwise
convergence) of the bijections of the vertices. Hence, it has a natural Polish group topology.

The goal of this paper is to understand the countable dense subgroups of Aut(R). We call a
group action Γ y R homogeneous if, for any graph isomorphism ϕ : U → V between ﬁnite
induced subgraphs U, V of R, there exists g ∈ Γ such that g(u) = ϕ(u) for all u ∈ U . The
homogeneity of R means exactly that Aut(R) y R is homogeneous. Moreover, it is easy to
check that a subgroup G < Aut(R) is dense if and only if the action G y R is homogeneous.

Hence, to understand the countable dense subgroups of R one has to identity the class HR
of all countable groups that admit a faithful and homogeneous action on R. Our ﬁrst result
is the following.

Theorem A. If Γ1, Γ2 are inﬁnite countable groups then Γ1 ∗ Γ2 ∈ HR.

To prove Theorem A, we ﬁrst show that any inﬁnite countable group Γ admits a “nice”
action on R (Corollary 2.7). To produce this explicit action on R we use an inductive limit
process. Then starting from two actions of Γ1 y R and Γ2 y R and an automorphism
α ∈ Aut(R), we construct a natural action πα : Γ1 ∗ Γ2 y R and we show that the set
{α ∈ Aut(R) : πα is faithful and homogeneous} is a dense Gδ in Aut(R) whenever the
initial actions are “nice enough” (Theorem 3.1).

We also study homogenous and faithful actions on R of non-commutative ﬁnitely generated
free groups. In that case we also prove a genericity result among a more natural class of actions
: those which have all orbits inﬁnite. More precisely, we prove the following result. For k ≥ 2
and α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ Aut(R)k, we denote by hαi the subgroup of Aut(R) generated by
α1, . . . , αk and by Ak := {α ∈ Aut(R)k : hαi y R has all orbits inﬁnite}. Since A is closed
in Aut(R)k, it is a Baire space.
Theorem B. For all k ≥ 2 the set of α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ Aut(R)k such that hαi is a free
group with basis (α1, . . . , αk) and hαi y R is homogeneous with all orbits inﬁnite is a dense
Gδ in Ak.

To prove Theorem B we use the “back-and-forth” device (Theorem 4.2).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 is a preliminary section in which we introduce
the notations used in the paper about graphs, random extensions and inductive limits. In
Section 2 we introduce the Random Graph and we show how to extend any group action on
a ﬁnite or countable graph to a group action on the Random Graph. We also study the basic
properties of the extension. Finally, we prove Theorem A in Section 3 and Theorem B in
Section 4.

By countable we always mean inﬁnite countable.

1. preliminaries

1.1. Graphs. A Graph G is a pair (V (G), E(G)), where V (G) is a set and E(G) ⊂ V (G)2 is
a subset such that E(G) ∩ ∆ = ∅, where ∆ = {(u, u) ∈ V (G)2 : u ∈ V (G)}, and (u, v) ∈
E(G) ⇔ (v, u) ∈ E(G). For u, v ∈ V (G), we write u ∼ v if (u, v) ∈ E(G).

Any subset U ⊂ V (G) has a natural structure of a graph, called the induced graph structure
on U and denoted by GU , deﬁned by V (GU ) = U and E(GU ) = E(G) ∩ (U × U ).

Let G1, G2 be two graphs. A morphism of graphs from G1 to G2 is a map π : V (G1) → V (G2)
such that, for all u, v ∈ V (G1), u ∼ v =⇒ π(u) ∼ π(v). A morphism π is called an
isomorphism of graphs if π is moreover bijective and its inverse π−1 : V (G2) → V (G1) is a
morphism of graphs. A morphism of graphs π : G1 → G2 is called open if

for all u, v ∈ V (G1), u ∼ v ⇔ π(u) ∼ π(v).

Note that the inclusion ι of a subset U ⊂ V (G) gives an open and injective graph homomor-
phism ι : GU → G. Moreover, an injective graph homomorphism π : G1 → G2 induces an
isomorphism between G1 and the induced graph on π(V (G1)) if and only if π is open.

HOMOGENEOUS ACTIONS ON THE RANDOM GRAPH

A partial isomorphism of a graph G is an isomorphism between induced subgraphs of G. We
write P (G) the set of partial isomorphisms. For ϕ ∈ P (G), we write d(ϕ) its domain and r(ϕ)
its range.

Given a graph G, we write Aut(G) the group of isomorphisms from G to G. An action of a
group Γ on the graph G is a group homomorphism α : Γ → Aut(G). We write Γ y G an
action of Γ on G. Note that the group Aut(G) has a natural induced topology coming from
the inclusion Aut(G) ⊂ S(V (G)), where S(X) is the group of bijections of X. this is the
topology of pointwise convergence as bijections on the vertices. With this topology Aut(G)
becomes a Polish group.

1.2. Group actions. The main purpose of this section is to introduce the Random Extension
of a group action on a graph. This notion will be crucial to produce explicit actions on the
Random Graph (Section 2.2). Many properties of an action are preserved by its Random
Extension (Proposition 1.1). However, the freeness property is not preserved; except for
actions of torsion-free groups. Nevertheless, a weaker -but still useful- property, that we call
strong faithfulness, is preserved.

An action Γ y X of a group Γ on a set X is called strongly faithful if, for all ﬁnite subsets
F ⊂ X with X − F 6= ∅ one has g(x) = x ∀x /∈ F =⇒ g = 1. Note that almost free =⇒
strongly faithful =⇒ faithful. When X is ﬁnite, an action on X is strongly faithful if and
only if it is free and when X is inﬁnite, an action Γ y X is strongly faithful if and only if for
all g ∈ Γ − {1}, {x ∈ X : gx 6= x} is inﬁnite.

An action Γ y G of a group Γ on a graph G is called homogeneous if for all ϕ ∈ P (G) with
d(ϕ) and r(ϕ) ﬁnite, there exists g ∈ Γ such that gu = ϕ(u) for all u ∈ d(ϕ). In other words,
Γ y G is homogeneous if any isomorphism between ﬁnite induced subgraphs of G can be
extended to an automorphism of G. It is easy to see that Γ y G is homogeneous if and only
the image of Γ in Aut(G) is dense.

We say that Γ y G has inﬁnite orbits (resp.
is strongly faithful) if the action
Γ y V (G) on the set V (G) has inﬁnite orbits i.e. all orbits are inﬁnite (resp. is free, resp. is
strongly faithful).

is free, resp.

We say that Γ y G disconnects the ﬁnite sets if for all ﬁnite subsets F ⊂ V (G) there exists
g ∈ Γ such that gF ∩ F = ∅ and, for all u, v ∈ F , gu ≁ v. Note that if Γ y G disconnects
the ﬁnite sets then it has inﬁnite orbits and the converse holds when E(G) = ∅. It is easy to
check that Γ y G disconnects the ﬁnite sets if and only if for all ﬁnite subsets F, F ′ ⊂ V (G)
there exists g ∈ Γ such that gF ∩ F ′ = ∅ and, for all u ∈ F , u′ ∈ F ′, gu ≁ u′.

We say that Γ y G is singular if there exists u ∈ V (G) and g ∈ Γ such that gu ∼ u.

In the sequel we always assume that G is a non-empty graph. The Random Extension of G is

the graph eG deﬁned by V (eG) = V (G) ⊔ Pf (V (G)), where Pf (X) denotes the set of non-empty
ﬁnite subsets of a set X, and E(eG) = E(G) ⊔ (⊔U ∈Pf (V (G))U × {U }) ⊔ (⊔U ∈Pf (V (G)){U } × U )
i.e., U ⊂ V (G) ⊂ V (eG) is exactly the set of neighbors of the vertex U ∈ V (eG). Note that the
inclusion ι : V (G) → V (eG) deﬁnes an injective and open graph homomorphism ι : G → eG.
Given an action Γ y G there is a natural action Γ y eG for which the map ι is Γ-equivariant.
Indeed, we take the original action of Γ on V (G) ⊂ V (eG) and, for U ∈ Pf (V (G)) ⊂ V (eG) and

g ∈ Γ, we deﬁne the action of g on U by g · U := gU := {gu : u ∈ U } ∈ Pf (V (G)). This

4

PIERRE FIMA, SOYOUNG MOON, AND YVES STALDER

deﬁnes an action of Γ on eG since for all z ∈ V (eG), U ∈ Pf (V (G)) and all g ∈ Γ we have

z ∼ U ⇔ z ∈ U ⇔ gz ∈ gU ⇔ g · z ∼ g · U.

It is clear that ι is Γ-equivariant.

Proposition 1.1. The following holds.

(1) Γ y eG is faithful if and only if Γ y G is faithful.
(2) Γ y eG is singular if and only if Γ y G is singular.
(3) Γ y eG has inﬁnite orbits if and only if Γ y G has inﬁnite orbits.
(4) Γ y eG disconnects the ﬁnite sets if and only if Γ y G disconnects the ﬁnite sets.
(5) If Γ has torsion then Γ y eG is not free and if Γ is torsion-free and Γ y G is free then
(6) If Γ y G is strongly faithful then Γ y eG is strongly faithful.

Γ y eG is free.

Proof. (1) and (2) are obvious.

(3). Suppose that Γ y G has inﬁnite orbits. Since ι is equivariant, it suﬃces to check that
the orbit of any U ∈ Pf (V (G)) is inﬁnite. Suppose that there is U ∈ Pf (V (G)) with a ﬁnite
orbit. Then there exists g1, . . . , gn ∈ Γ such that for all g ∈ Γ there exists i ∈ {1, . . . , n} such
that gU = giU . Hence ∪g∈ΓgU is a ﬁnite set since ∪g∈ΓgU ⊂ ∪n
i=1giU . However, since U 6= ∅,
there exists x ∈ U and Γx ⊂ ∪g∈ΓgU is inﬁnite, a contradiction. The converse is obvious.

write F = F1 ⊔ F2, where F1 = F ∩ V (G) and F2 = F ∩ Pf (V (G)). Deﬁne the ﬁnite subset

gu ≁ v. Moreover, for all U, V ∈ F2, gU ∩ V = ∅ hence gU 6= V so gF2 ∩ F2 = ∅. Obvisouly
gF1 ∩ F2 = ∅ and, since gF1 ∩ U = ∅ for all U ∈ F2 we ﬁnd that gu ≁ U for all u ∈ F1 and all

(4). Suppose that Γ y G disconnects the ﬁnite sets. Let F ⊂ V (eG) be a ﬁnite set and
eF = F1 ∪ (∪U ∈F2U ) ⊂ V (G). Since Γ y G disconnects the ﬁnite sets there exists g ∈ Γ such
that geF ∩ eF = ∅ and, for all u, v ∈ eF , u ≁ gv. It follows gF1 ∩ F1 = ∅ and for all u, v ∈ F1,
U ∈ F2. Hence gF ∩ F = ∅ and for all u, v ∈ F , gu ≁ v. This shows that Γ y eG disconnects
(5). Suppose Γ y G is free and Γ y eG is not free. Then, there exists U ∈ Pf (V (G)) and

g ∈ Γ − {1} such that gU = U . Then gnU = U for all n ≥ 0. Since U 6= ∅ there exists x ∈ U
and the set {gnx : n ≥ 0} is ﬁnite since it is a subset of U . Hence, there exists n ≥ 1 such
that gnx = x. Since Γ y G is free we have gn = 1 and Γ is not torsion free. Suppose now
that Γ has torsion. Let g ∈ Γ, g 6= 1, such that hgi is a ﬁnite subgroup of Γ. Let u ∈ V (G).

the ﬁnite sets. The converse is obvious.

The set F = hgiu ⊂ V (G) is ﬁnite and gF = F hence Γ y eG is not free.
(6). Let F ⊂ V (eG) be a ﬁnite subset and g ∈ Γ such that g(x) = x for all x /∈ F . Deﬁne
eF = F ∩ V (G), which is a ﬁnite subset of V (G). Since V (G) − eF ⊂ V (eG) − F we have g(x) = x
for all x ∈ V (G) − eF . Since Γ y G is strongly faithful it follows that g = 1.

1.3. Inductive limits. Let Xn be a sequence of ﬁnite or countable sets with injective maps
ιn : Xn → Xn+1. Let l ≥ n. Deﬁne the injective map ιl,n : Xn → Xl by ιl,n = ιl−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ιn
if l > n, and ιn,n = id. Observe that for all n ≤ m ≤ l, ιl,m ◦ ιm,n = ιl,n. Let X∞ be the
inductive limit i.e. X∞ = ⊔Xn/ ∼, where x ∼ y if and only if there exists n, m ∈ N and
l ≥ n, m such that x ∈ Xn, y ∈ Xm and ιl,n(x) = ιl,m(y). Observe that we have injections
ι∞,n : Xn → X∞, ι∞,n(x) = [x], where [x] denotes the class of the element x ∈ Xn ⊂ ⊔nXn
for the equivalence relation described above. Those injections satisfy X∞ = ∪↑
nι∞,n(Xn)

(cid:3)

and ι∞,n+1 ◦ ιn = ι∞,n for all n ∈ N. Actually X∞ is the unique set, up to a canonical
bijection, such that there exists injections ι∞,n : Xn → X∞ satisfying X∞ = ∪↑
nι∞,n(Xn)
and ι∞,n+1 ◦ ιn = ιn for all n ∈ N. Note that X∞ is at most countable. Actually, it is ﬁnite if
and only if for all n ∈ N, Xn is ﬁnite and there exists l ∈ N such that ιk(Xk) = Xk+1 for all
k ≥ l.

For a set X, we write S(X) the group of bijections of X. Given a sequence of actions
πn : Γ → S(Xn) of a group Γ on the set Xn satisfying πn+1(g) ◦ ιn = ιn ◦ πn(g) for all n ∈ N
and g ∈ Γ, we deﬁne the inductive limit action π∞ : Γ → S(X∞) by π∞(g)◦ι∞,n = ι∞,n◦πn(g)
for all n ∈ N. The next proposition contains some standard observations on inductive limits.
Since this results are well known and very easy to check, we omit the proof.

Proposition 1.2. The following holds.

(1) If there exists n ∈ N such that Γ y Xn is faithful then Γ y X∞ is faithful.
(2) Γ y X∞ is free if and only if Γ y Xn is free for all n ∈ N.
(3) If Γ y Xn is strongly faithful for all n ∈ N then Γ y X∞ is strongly faithful.
(4) Γ y X∞ has inﬁnite orbits if and only if Γ y Xn has inﬁnite orbits for all n ∈ N.

Let Gn be a sequence of ﬁnite or countable graphs with injective graphs homomorphisms ιn :
Gn → Gn+1. We still denote by ιn the injective maps between the vertices i.e. ιn : V (Gn) →
V (Gn+1) and we deﬁne the inductive limit graph G∞ by deﬁning V (G∞) = ∪↑ι∞,n(V (Gn)) as
the inductive limit of the V (Gn) with respect to the maps ιn and E(G∞) is the set of couples
(u, v) ∈ V (G∞)2 for which there exists k ≥ n, m with u = ι∞,n(u0), u0 ∈ V (Gn), v = ι∞,m(v0),
v0 ∈ V (Gm) and (ιk,n(u0), ιk,m(v0)) ∈ E(Gk). We collect elementary observations on the
inductive limit graph in the following proposition.

Proposition 1.3. The following holds.

(1) ι∞,n is a graph homomorphism for all n ∈ N.
(2) If ιn is open for all n ∈ N then ι∞,n is open for all n ∈ N.
(3) If Γ y G∞ disconnects the ﬁnite sets then Γ y Gn disconnects the ﬁnite sets for all

n ∈ N. The converse holds when ιn is open for all n ∈ N.

(4) If Γ y G∞ is non-singular then Γ y Gn is non-singular for all n ∈ N. The converse

holds when ιn is open for all n ∈ N.

Proof. (1) is obvious.

(2). Suppose that ιn is open for all n ∈ N and let u, v ∈ V (Gn) such that ι∞,n(u) ∼ ι∞,n(v).
Then, there exists k ≥ 0 such that (ιk+n,n(u), ιk+n,n(v)) ∈ E(Gk+n) and a proof by induction
on k ≥ 0 shows that (u, v) ∈ E(Gn).

(3). Suppose that Γ y G∞ disconnects the ﬁnite sets and let n ∈ N and F ⊂ V (Gn) be a
ﬁnite subset. Let F ′ = ι∞,n(F ) ⊂ V (G∞) and take g ∈ Γ such that gF ′ ∩ F ′ = ∅ and gu′ ≁ v′
for all u′, v′ ∈ F ′. It follows that gF ∩ F = ∅ and ι∞,n(gu) ≁ ι∞,n(v) for all u, v ∈ F . By
(1) we have gu ≁ v for all u, v ∈ F . Suppose now that ιn is open and Γ y Gn disconnects
the ﬁnite sets for all n ∈ N. Let F ⊂ V (G∞) be a ﬁnite set and take n ∈ N large enough so
that F = ι∞,n(F ′), where F ′ ⊂ V (Gn) is a ﬁnite set. Take g ∈ Γ such that gF ′ ∩ F ′ = ∅ and
gu′ ≁ v′ for all u′, v′ ∈ F ′. Since ι∞,n injective we have gF ∩ F = ∅ and since ι∞,n is open
(by (2)) we have gu ≁ v for all u, v ∈ F .

6

(4). Suppose that Γ y G∞ is non-singular and let n ∈ N, u ∈ V (Gn) and g ∈ Γ. Then
ι∞,n(gu) = gι∞,n(u) ≁ ι∞,n(u) which implies that gu ≁ u since ι∞,n is a graph homomor-
phism. Suppose now that ιn is open and Γ y Gn is non-singular for all n ∈ N. Let u ∈ V (G∞)
and g ∈ Γ. Let n ∈ N large enough so that u = ι∞,n(u′), where u′ ∈ V (Gn). Then gu′ ≁ u′
implies that gu = ι∞(gu′) ≁ ι∞u′ = u since ι∞,n is open.

(cid:3)

2. The Random Graph

2.1. Deﬁnition of the Random Graph. Given a graph G and subsets U, V ⊂ V (G) we
deﬁne GU,V as the induced subgraph on the subsets of vertices

V (GU,V ) := {z ∈ V (G) − (U ∪ V ) : z ∼ u , ∀u ∈ U and z ≁ v , ∀v ∈ V }.

Note that V (GU,V ) may be empty for some subsets U, V . To ease the notations we will denote
by the same symbol GU,V the induced graph on V (GU,V ) and the set of vertices V (GU,V ).

Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a graph G has property (R) if, for any disjoint ﬁnite subsets
U, V ⊂ V (G), GU,V 6= ∅.

Note that a graph with property (R) is necessarily inﬁnite. We recall the following well-known
result (See e.g. [Ca97] or [Ca99]).

Proposition 2.2. Let G1, G2 be two countable graphs with property (R) and A ⊂ V (G1),
B ⊂ V (G2) be ﬁnite subsets. Any isomorphism between the induced graphs ϕ : (G1)A → (G2)B
extends to an isomorphism ϕ : G1 → G2.

There are many ways to construct a countable graph with property (R). Proposition 2.2
shows that an at most countable graph with property (R) is unique, up to isomorphism.
Such a graph is denoted by R and called the Random Graph. It also follows from Proposition
2.2 that every ϕ ∈ P (R) admits an extension ϕ ∈ Aut(R) (i.e. ϕ|d(ϕ) = ϕ). Proposition 2.2
is also useful to show stability properties of the graph R as done in the next Proposition.

Proposition 2.3. The following holds.

(1) For all ﬁnite subset A ⊂ V (R), the induced subgraph RV (R)−A on V (R) − A is

isomorphic to R.

(2) For all ﬁnite and disjoint U, V ⊂ V (R), RU,V is isomorphic to R.
(3) For all ﬁnite and non-empty or countable graph G, the inductive limit of the sequence

G0 = G and Gn+1 = eGn (with ιn : Gn → Gn+1 the inclusion) is isomorphic to R. In

particular every ﬁnite or countable graph is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of R.

Proof. (1). Let U, V ⊂ V (R) − A be disjoint ﬁnite subsets. Apply property (R) with the
disjoint ﬁnite subsets U ′ = U ⊔ A, V ⊂ V (R) and get z ∈ V (R) − (U ′ ∪ V ) = (V (R) − A) −
(U ∪ V ) such that z ∼ u for all u ∈ U and z ≁ v for all v ∈ V . Hence the countable graph
induced on V (R) − A has property (R).

(2). Since RU,V is at most countable, it suﬃces to check that RU,V has property (R) and it
is left to the reader.

(3). Since G is either ﬁnite and non-empty or inﬁnite countable, the inductive limit is inﬁnite
countable and it suﬃces to check that it has property (R). Since ιn is open for all n ∈ N
it follows from Proposition 1.3 that we may and will assume that ι∞,n = id and (Gn)n is an
increasing sequence of induced subgraphs of G∞ such that G∞ = ∪↑Gn. Let U, V be two ﬁnite

and disjoint subsets of the inductive limit. Let n large enough so that U, V   V (Gn). If U 6= ∅,
we consider the element z = U ∈ Pf (V (Gn)) ⊂ V (Gn+1) ⊂ V (G∞) and if U = ∅, we consider
the element z = {x} ∈ Pf (Gn) ⊂ V (Gn+1) ⊂ V (G∞) for x ∈ V (Gn) − V . Then, by deﬁnition
of the Random extension, we have, for all u ∈ U , (u, z) ∈ E(Gn+1) and, for all v ∈ V ,
(v, z) /∈ E(Gn+1). Since Gn+1 is the induced subgraph on V (Gn+1) we have z ∈ (G∞)U,V . The
last assertion also follows from Proposition 1.3 since the inclusion of G0 = G in the inductive
limit is open.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.4. The construction of Proposition 2.3, assertions (3), shows the existence of R.
This construction may also be performed starting with any countable or ﬁnite graph G, even
G = ∅, and replacing, in the construction of the Random Extension, Pf (X) by all the ﬁnite
subsets of X (even the empty one). The resulting inductive limit is again isomorphic to R.

2.2. Induced action on the Random Graph. Let Γ y G be an action of a group Γ on a
non-empty and ﬁnite or countable graph G and consider the sequence of graphs G0 = G and

Gn+1 = eGn with the associated sequence of actions Γ y Gn. By Proposition 2.3, assertion

(3), the inductive limit action deﬁnes an action of Γ on R. We call it the induced action of
Γ y G on R. We will show in Corollary 2.6 that many properties on the action Γ y G are
preserved when passing to the induced action Γ y R. However, freeness is not preserved and
one has to consider a weaker notion that we call property (F ).

Deﬁnition 2.5. We say that an action Γ y G has property (F ) if for all g ∈ Γ with g 6= 1
and all ﬁnite subset F ⊂ V (G), there exists x ∈ V (G) − F such that x ≁ u for all u ∈ F and
gx 6= x.

Note that any action with property (F ) is faithful and any free action on R has property (F )

Corollary 2.6. Let Γ y G be an action of a group Γ on a non-empty and ﬁnite or countable
graph G and write Γ y R the induced action. The following holds.

(1) If Γ y G is faithful then Γ y R is faithful.
(2) If Γ y G has inﬁnite orbits then Γ y R has inﬁnite orbits.
(3) If Γ y G disconnects the ﬁnite sets then Γ y R disconnects the ﬁnite sets.
(4) If Γ y G is non-singular then Γ y R is non-singular.
(5) If Γ y G is free and Γ is torsion free then Γ y R is free.
(6) If Γ y G is strongly faithful then Γ y R has property (F ).

Proof. The assertions (1) to (5) follow directly follows from Propositions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. Let

us prove (6). We recall that R = ∪↑Gn, where G0 = G and Gn+1 = fGn. Let F ⊂ V (G∞)

be a ﬁnite subset and g ∈ Γ, g 6= 1. Since G∞ is inﬁnite, there exists N ∈ N such that
F ⊂ V (GN ) and F 6= V (GN ). Since Γ y G is strongly faithful we deduce, by 1.1 and
induction that Γ y GN is strongly faithfu. Moreover, since F is ﬁnite and g 6= 1, it follows
from strong faithfulness that there exists y ∈ V (GN ) − F for which gy 6= y. Deﬁne x := {y} ∈
Pf (V (GN )) ⊂ V (GN +1) ⊂ V (G∞) = V (R). By construction x ∈ V (R) − F , gx 6= x and, since
the inclusion GN +1 ⊂ G∞ = R is open, we also have x ≁ u for all u ∈ F .
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.7. Every countable group Γ admits an action Γ y R that is non-singular, has
Property (F ) and disconnects the ﬁnite sets. If Γ is torsion-free then the action can be chosen
to be moreover free.

Proof. Consider the graph G deﬁned by V (G) = Γ and E(G) = ∅ with the action Γ y G
given by left multiplication which is free, has inﬁnite orbits and hence disconnects the ﬁnite

8

sets and is non-singular since E(G) = ∅. By Corollary 2.6 the induced action Γ y R has the
required properties.
(cid:3)

2.3. Homogeneous actions on the Random Graph.

Proposition 2.8. Let Γ y R be an homogeneous action. The following holds.

(1) Γ y R disconnects the ﬁnite sets.
(2) Every central element of Γ acts trivially on R.
(3) If N < Γ is normal and N y R is non-singular then, for every u ∈ V (R), either

N u = {u} or N u = {v ∈ V (R) : v ≁ u}.

(4) If N < Γ is normal and N y R disconnects the ﬁnite sets then either N y R is

trivial or N y R is homogeneous.

Proof. (1). Let F ⊂ V (R) be a ﬁnite set and write F = {u1, . . . , un} where the vertices ui are
pairwise distinct. We shall deﬁne inductively pairwise distinct vertices v1, . . . vn ∈ V (R) − F
such that, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, ui ∼ uj ⇔ vi ∼ vj and ui ≁ vj. Take v1 ∈ R∅,F . Suppose that
for a given 1 ≤ l ≤ n − 1 we have pairwise distinct vertices v1, . . . , vl ∈ V (R) − F such that,
for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ l, ui ∼ uj ⇔ vi ∼ vj and ui ≁ vj. Let U = {vi : 1 ≤ i ≤ l s.t. ui ∼ ul+1}
and V = {vi
: 1 ≤ i ≤ l s.t. ui ≁ ul+1}. Then U and V ⊔ F are ﬁnite and disjoint.
Take vl+1 ∈ RU,V ⊔F . Then vl+1 ∼ vi ⇔ ul+1 ∼ ui and vl+1 ≁ ui for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l and
vl+1 /∈ F ⊔ {vi : 1 ≤ i ≤ l}. This concludes the construction of the vi by induction. By the
properties of the vi, the map ϕ : {ui : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} → {vi : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} deﬁned by ϕ(ui) = vi
is an isomorphism between the induced subgraphs. Since Γ y R is homogeneous there exists
g ∈ Γ such that gui = vi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It follows that gF ∩ F = ∅ and gu ≁ u′ for all
u, u′ ∈ F .

(2). Let g ∈ Γ acting non-trivially on G. Let u ∈ V (R) such that gu 6= u and deﬁne v = gu.
Let x ∈ R∅,{u,v}.
If u ∼ v take y ∈ R{x},∅ − {gx} and if u ≁ v take y ∈ R∅,{x} − {gx}.
This is possible because the sets R{x},∅ and R∅,{x} are inﬁnite. Then y 6= x, y 6= gx and the
map ϕ : {u, v} → {x, y} deﬁned by ϕ(u) = x and ϕ(v) = y is an isomorphism between the
induced subgraphs. Since Γ y R is homogeneous, there exists h ∈ Γ such that hu = x and
and ghu = gx 6= y. It follows that gh 6= hg and g is not
hv = y. We have hgu = hv = y
central.

(3). Let u ∈ V (R) such that N u 6= {u}. Since N y R is non-singular, it suﬃces to prove
that {v ∈ V (R) : v ≁ u} ⊂ N u. Since N u 6= {u} there exists h ∈ N such that hu 6= u. Let
v ∈ V (R) such that v ≁ u, v 6= u. Since N y R is non-singular we have hu ≁ u and the map
ϕ : {u, v} → {u, hu} deﬁned by ϕ(u) = u and ϕ(v) = hu is a graph isomorphism between the
induced subgraphs. Let g ∈ Γ such that gu = u and gv = hu. We have g−1hgu = g−1hu = v.
Since N is normal in Γ we deduced that v ∈ N u and, since we obviously have u ∈ N u, it
follows that {v ∈ V (R) : v ≁ u} ⊂ N u.

(4). Suppose that N y R is not trivial. Let F1, F2 be ﬁnite subsets and ϕ : F1 → F2 be
an isomorphism between the induced subgraphs. Write F1 = {u1, . . . , un}, F2 = {v1, . . . , vn}
and ϕ(ui) = vi, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n. Since N y R disconnects the ﬁnite sets, there exists h, h′ ∈ N
such that hF2 ∩ (F1 ∪ F2) = ∅, hv ≁ x, ∀v ∈ F2, x ∈ F1 ∪ F2 and h′F1 ∩ (F1 ∪ F2) = ∅,
h′u ≁ x, ∀u ∈ F1, x ∈ F1 ∪ F2. Then the map ψ : {ui, hvi} → {ui, h′ui} deﬁned by ψ(ui) = ui
and ψ(hvi) = h′ui, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n is an isomorphism between the induced subgraphs since
hvi ∼ hvj ⇔ vi ∼ vj ⇔ ui ∼ uj ⇔ h′ui ∼ h′uj because ϕ is an isomorphism. Since Γ y R is

homogeneous, there exists g ∈ Γ such that gui = ui and ghvi = h′ui, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n. Therefore
h−1g−1h′g ∈ N and h−1g−1h′gui = vi, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Corollary 2.9. If Γ admits a faithful and homogeneous action on R then the center of Γ is
trivial.

3. Actions of free products on the Random Graph

Let Γ1, Γ2 be two countable subgroups of Aut(R) and deﬁne Γ = Γ1 ∗ Γ2. For all α ∈ Aut(R),
there exists a unique group homomorphism πα : Γ → Aut(R) such that:

πα(g) =(cid:26) g

if g ∈ Γ1,
α−1gα if g ∈ Γ2.

In this section we prove the following result.

Theorem 3.1. If Γ1, Γ2 y R are non-singular, disconnect the ﬁnite sets and have Property
(F ) then the set O = {α ∈ Aut(R) : πα is homogeneous and faithful} is a dense Gδ in
Aut(R).
In particular, for every countable (inﬁnite) groups Γ1, Γ2 the group Γ = Γ1 ∗ Γ2
admits a faithful and homogeneous action on R.

Proof. We separate the proof in two lemmas.

Lemma 3.2. If Γ1, Γ2 y R disconnect the ﬁnite sets then the set
U = {α ∈ Aut(R) : πα is homogeneous}

is a dense Gδ in Aut(R).

Proof. Let Pf (R) := {ϕ ∈ P(R) : d(ϕ) is ﬁnite} and note that Pf (R) is countable. Since
U = ∩ϕ∈Pf (R)Uϕ, where Uϕ = {α ∈ Aut(R) : ∃g ∈ Γ such that πα(g)|d(ϕ) = ϕ} is obviously
open, it suﬃces to show that Uϕ is dense for all ϕ ∈ Pf (R). Let ϕ ∈ Pf (R), α ∈ Aut(R) and
F ⊂ V (R) a ﬁnite subset. It suﬃces to show that there exists γ ∈ Aut(R) and g ∈ Γ such
that γ|F = α|F and πγ(g)|d(ϕ) = ϕ. Since Γ1 y R disconnects the ﬁnite sets, there exists
g1 ∈ Γ1 such that g1d(ϕ) ∩ F = ∅ and and g1x ≁ u for all u ∈ F , x ∈ d(ϕ). There exists also
g2 ∈ Γ1 such that g−1
2 y ≁ u for all u ∈ F ⊔ g1d(ϕ), y ∈ r(ϕ).
Write d(ϕ) = {x1, . . . , xn}.

2 r(ϕ) ∩ (F ⊔ g1d(ϕ)) = ∅ and g−1

Claim. There exists pairwise distinct vertices z1, . . . , zn ∈ V (R) − α(F ) such that

• for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, xi ∼ xj ⇔ zi ∼ zj.
• for all u ∈ F , for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, zi ≁ α(u).

Proof of the Claim. We deﬁne inductively the vertices z1, . . . , zn ∈ V (R) − α(F ). For n = 1
we take z1 ∈ R∅,α(F ). Then z1 /∈ α(F ) and, for all u ∈ F , α(u) ≁ z1. Suppose that, for a
given 1 ≤ l ≤ n − 1, we have pairwise distinct vertices z1, . . . , zl ∈ V (R) − α(F ) such that
∀1 ≤ i, j ≤ l, xi ∼ xj ⇔ zi ∼ zj and ∀u ∈ F, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ l, α(u) ≁ zi. Deﬁne

U = {zi : 1 ≤ i ≤ l s.t. xi ∼ xl+1} and V = {zi : 1 ≤ i ≤ l s.t. xi ≁ xl+1} ⊔ α(F ).

Take zl+1 ∈ RU,V ⊂ V (R) − (U ∪ V ) = V (R) − (α(F ) ⊔ {zi : 1 ≤ i ≤ l}). Then, for all u ∈ F ,
α(u) ≁ zl+1 and, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l, xi ∼ xl+1 ⇔ zi ∼ zl+1.

End of the proof of the Lemma. Write d(ϕ) = {x1, . . . , xn} and deﬁne, for 1 ≤ k ≤ n, yk =
ϕ(xk). Let z1, . . . zn be the elements obtained by the Claim and F ′ = α(F ) ⊔ {zi : i ≤ i ≤ n}.
Since Γ2 y R disconnects the ﬁnite sets, there exists h ∈ Γ2 such that hF ′ ∩ F ′ = ∅ and

for all u, v ∈ F ′, hu ≁ v. Deﬁne A = F ⊔ {g1xi
2 yk : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
and B = α(F ) ⊔ {zi

structure on A and B. By the Claim, the bijection γ0 : A → B deﬁned by γ0(u) = α(u)
for u ∈ F and γ0(g1xi) = zi, γ0(g−1
2 yi) = hzi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n is a graph isomorphism since
g1, g2, h ∈ Aut(R) and ϕ ∈ P (R) hence, g1xi ∼ g1xj ⇔ xi ∼ xj ⇔ zi ∼ zj and similarly
g−1
2 yi ∼ g−1
2 yj ⇔ yi ∼ yj ⇔ hzi ∼ hzj. Let γ ∈ Aut(R) be an extension of γ0. Note that
γ|F = α|F moreover, with g = g2hg1 ∈ Γ we have, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n,

: 1 ≤ i ≤ n} ⊔ {g−1

πγ(g)xi = g2γ−1hγg1xi = g2γ−1hzi = g2g−1

2 yi = yi.

Lemma 3.3. Let Γ1, Γ2 y R be a non-singular action having Property (F ). Then the set

is a dense Gδ in Aut(R).

V = {α ∈ Aut(R) : πα is faithful}

Proof. Writing V = ∩g∈Γ−{1}Vg, where Vg = {α ∈ Aut(R) : πα(g) 6= id} is obviously open,
it suﬃces to show that Vg is dense for all g ∈ Γ − {1}. If g ∈ Γk − {1} (k = 1, 2) then it is
easy to see that Vg = Aut(R). Hence it suﬃces to show that Vg is dense for all g reduced
of length at least 2. We will show that Vg is dense for all g ∈ Γ − {1} having a reduced
expression starting and ending with Γ1 − {1}. The other cases can be proved similarly. Let
α ∈ Aut(R) and F ⊂ V (R) be a ﬁnite subset. It suﬃces to show that there exists γ ∈ Aut(R)
such that γ|F = α|F and πγ(g) 6= id. Suppose that g has a reduced expression of the form
g = gnhn . . . g1h1g0, where n ≥ 1, gk ∈ Γ1 − {1} and hk ∈ Γ2 − {1}.

Claim. There exists x0, . . . , x2n ∈ V (R) such that the vertices x2k, gkx2k for 0 ≤ k ≤ n and
α−1x2k−1, α−1hkx2k−1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ n are pairwise distinct and all disjoint from F and such
that the only edges of the induced subgraph on

Y = F ⊔ {x2k, gkx2k : 0 ≤ k ≤ n} ⊔ {α−1x2k−1, α−1hkx2k−1 : 1 ≤ k ≤ n}

are of the form (u, v) for u, v ∈ F .

Proof of the Claim. We proceed by induction on n ≥ 1. Note that, by hypothesis on the
actions, for all ﬁnite subset Y ⊂ V (R) and for all h ∈ Γ1 ∪ Γ2, h 6= 1 the set
Eh,Y := {x ∈ V (R)−(Y ∪h−1Y ) : x ≁ u ∀u ∈ Y ∪h−1Y and hx 6= x and hx ≁ x} is non-empty.
If n = 1 we take x0 ∈ Eg0,F . Then x0, g0x0 /∈ F , g0x0 6= x0, g0x0 ≁ x0, x0 ≁ u and g0x0 ≁ u for
all u ∈ F . Deﬁne F1 = α(F ∪ {x0, g0x0}) and take x1 ∈ Eh1,F1. Hence α−1x1 and α−1h1x1 are
not adjacent to any vertex in the set {x0, g0x0}∪ F . Moreover, since x1 6= h1x1 and x1 ≁ h1x1
we have α−1x1 6= α−1h1x1 and α−1x1 ≁ α−1h1x1. Deﬁne F2 = F ⊔{x0, g0x0, α−1x1, α−1h1x1}
and take x2 ∈ Eg1,F2. Since x2 6= g2x2 and x2 ≁ g2x2, this concludes the proof for the case
n = 1. Suppose the claim holds for a given n ≥ 1 and let g ∈ Γ with reduced expression

g = gn+1hn+1 . . . g1h1g1, where gk ∈ Γ1 − {1} and hk ∈ Γ2 − {1}.

Let x0, . . . , x2n ∈ V (R) be the vertices given by the induction hypothesis for the reduced
word g′ = gnhn . . . g1h1g0. Deﬁne

F2n+1 = α(cid:0)F ⊔ {x2k, gkx2k : 0 ≤ k ≤ n} ⊔ {α−1x2k−1, α−1hkx2k−1 : 1 ≤ k ≤ n}(cid:1) .

Take x2n+1 ∈ Ehn+1,F2n+1 and deﬁne

F2n+2 = F ⊔ {x2k, gkx2k : 0 ≤ k ≤ n} ⊔ {α−1x2k−1, α−1hkx2k−1 : 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1}.

HOMOGENEOUS ACTIONS ON THE RANDOM GRAPH

11

Take x2n+2 ∈ Egn+1,F2n+2. Note that the elements x0, . . . , x2n+2 satisfy the desired property
since x2n+1 6= hn+1x2n+1 and x2n+1 ≁ hn+1x2n+1 implies α−1x2n+1 6= α−1hn+1x2n+1 and
α−1x2n+1 ≁ α−1hn+1x2n+1. Also, x2n+2 6= gn+1x2n+2 and x2n+2 ≁ gn+1x2n+2.
End of the proof of the Lemma. If g has a reduced expression of the form g = gnhn . . . g1h1g0,
where n ≥ 1, gk ∈ Γ1 − {1} and hk ∈ Γ2 − {1} we consider the vertices x0, . . . x2n and the set
Y = F ⊔ {x2k, gkx2k : 0 ≤ k ≤ n} ⊔ {α−1x2k−1, α−1hkx2k−1 : 1 ≤ k ≤ n} given by the Claim
2. Since the only edges of the induced subgraph on Y are the ones from F , the bijection
γ0 : Y → α(Y ) deﬁned by γ0|F = α|F and,

γ0(gkx2k) = x2k+1, γ0(α−1x2k+1) = αgkx2k, for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 and,

γ0(x2k) = hkx2k−1, γ0(α−1hkx2k−1) = αx2k, for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n,

is actually an isomorphism between the induced subgraphs. Let γ ∈ Aut(R) such that
γ|Y = γ0. Then γ|F = α|F and πγ(g)x0 = gnγ−1hnγ . . . g1γ−1h1γg0x0 = gnx2n 6= x0. Hence,
πγ(g) 6= id.

End of the proof of the Theorem. By the preceding Lemmas, O is a dense Gδ. The last
assertion follows from Corollary 2.7.

4. Actions of free groups on the random graph

In this Section, we prove Theorem B. The following Lemma gives us a reﬁnement of the
homogeneity of R.

Lemma 4.1. For any isomorphisms σj : Aj → Bj (1 ≤ j ≤ k) between ﬁnite induced
subgraphs of R, there exist extensions ¯σ1, . . . , ¯σk ∈ Aut(R) with the following additional
properties:

(1) for all j, the only ﬁnite cycles of ¯σj (seen as a permutation of the vertices) are those

of σj;

(2) the edges in the induced subgraph on

[ϕ∈h¯σ1,...¯σki [j=1,...,k

ϕ(Aj ∪ Bj)

are exactly the translates of the edges in (the induced subgraph on) Sj(Aj ∪ Bj) by

elements of the subgroup h¯σ1, . . . ¯σki.

Proof. Let z0, z1, z2, . . . be an enumeration of the vertices of R. We are going to construct
inductively extensions σ1,n, . . . , σk,n for n ∈ N where σj,n : Aj,n → Bj,n and Aj,n, Bj,n are
ﬁnite. First, we set σj,0 := σj for j = 1, . . . , k. Next, we assume that σ1,n, . . . , σk,n have been
constructed and we explain how to extend them to σ1,n+1, . . . , σk,n+1. This will be done in
three steps.

Step 1 – “extension of orbits”: We begin by extending the orbit of σ1,n. Let us
write B1,n − A1,n = {x1, . . . , xℓ} and A1,n − B1,n = {v1, . . . , vℓ}. First, by deﬁnition
of R we successively get new vertices y1, . . . , yℓ such that:

• the vertex y1 is a neighbour of vertices y ∈ B1,n such that σ−1

1,ny ∼ x1 and not a

neigbour of other vertices in Sj=1...,k Aj,n ∪ Bj,n;

12

PIERRE FIMA, SOYOUNG MOON, AND YVES STALDER

• for 2 ≤ i ≤ ℓ, the vertex yi is a neighbour of vertices y ∈ B1,n such that σ−1

1,ny ∼ xi
and vertices ys (1 ≤ s < i) such that xs ∼ xi, and isn’t a neigbour of other vertices

Next, again by deﬁnition of R) we successively get new vertices u1, . . . , uℓ such that:
• the vertex u1 is a neighbour of vertices u ∈ A1,n such that σ1,nu ∼ v1 and not a

in {y1, . . . , yi−1} ∪ (Sj=1...,k Aj,n ∪ Bj,n).
neigbour of other vertices in {y1, . . . , yℓ} ∪ (Sj=1...,k Aj,n ∪ Bj,n);
in {u1, . . . , ui−1} ∪ {y1, . . . , yℓ} ∪ (Sj=1...,k Aj,n ∪ Bj,n).

• for 2 ≤ i ≤ ℓ, the vertex ui is a neighbour of vertices u ∈ A1,n such that σ1,nu ∼ vi
and vertices us (1 ≤ s < i) such that vs ∼ vi, and isn’t a neigbour of other vertices

Then, we replace An and Bn by An∪{u1, . . . , uℓ, x1, . . . , xℓ} and Bn∪{v1, . . . , vℓ, y1, . . . yℓ}
respectively, and we extend σ1,n by setting σ1,nui = vi and σ1,nxi = yi for i = 1, . . . , ℓ.
Observe that after the extension, σ1,n goes again from A1,n to B1,n. Observe also
that, by construction:

• σ1,n is again a graph isomorphism,
• σ1,n has no new ﬁnite cycle,

• and the new edges in (the extended) Sj=1...,k Aj,n ∪ Bj,n are all translates of

former ones by σ1,n or σ−1
1,n.

After that, we proceed analoguously to exend σ2,n, then σ3,n, . . . , then σk,n.

Step 2 – “back and forth”: For τ being successively (the extended versions coming

from Step 1 of) σ1,n, σ1,n,−1 , . . . σ1,n, σ1,n,−1 we do the following.

We set m to be the minimal index such that τ is not deﬁned on zm yet. By deﬁnition

of R, we ﬁnd a new vertex z which:

• is a neighbour of vertices y in the image of τ such that τ −1y ∼ zm;

• isn’t a neighbour of other vertices already considered (including those ofSj=1...,k Aj,n∪

Bj,n).

After that, we extend τ and τ −1 by setting τ (zm) = z (we extend the corresponding
Aj,n, Bj,n accordingly). Observe that, after extensions:

• σj,n are again a graph isomorphisms,
• σj,n have no new ﬁnite cycles,

• and the new edges in (the extended) Sj=1...,k Aj,n ∪ Bj,n are all translates of

former ones by σ1,n or σ−1
1,n.

Step 3: Finally, we just set σj,n+1 = σj,n for j = 1, . . . , n.

From the observations made at the end of Steps 1 and 2, one deduces the following by
induction:

(1) for all j and n, the only ﬁnite cycles of σj,n are those of σj;
(2) for all n, the edges in the induced subgraph on

[ϕ∈hσ1,n,...σk,ni [j=1,...,k

ϕ(Aj ∪ Bj)

are exactly the translates of the edges in (the induced subgraph on) Sj(Aj ∪ Bj) by

elements of the subgroup hσ1,n, . . . σk,ni.

Hence, the proof is concluded by deﬁning ¯σ1, . . . , ¯σk in the following way: we set ¯σjx = y if
there exists n such that σj,nx = y (that is, ¯σj is the “union”, or the “limit”, of the σj,n’s for
n ∈ N).

HOMOGENEOUS ACTIONS ON THE RANDOM GRAPH

13

Now, let us ﬁx an integer k ≥ 2. Given a k-tuple α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ Aut(R)k, we denote by
hαi the subgroup generated by α1, . . . , αk. Then the set

A = {α ∈ Aut(R)k : every hαi-orbit on the vertices is inﬁnite}

is closed in Aut(R)k, which is closed on S(R)k. Thus A is a Baire space. We also consider
the subsets

F = {α ∈ Aut(R)k : hαi is a free group with basis α1, . . . , αk};
H = {α ∈ Aut(R)k : hαi acts homogeneously on Aut(R)}.

Theorem 4.2. The subset A ∩ F ∩ H is a dense Gδ in A.

We denote by Fk the free group on k generators a1, . . . , ak. For any α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈
Aut(R)k, there exists a unique homomorphism πα : Fk → Aut(R) such that πα(aj) = αj for
all j. We will denote by α := πα for the rest of the paper. Then, one has hαi = {α(w) : w ∈
Fk}.

Proof. Let us prove that A ∩ H is a dense Gδ in A. To do this, we observe that A ∩ H =

Tϕ∈P (R)(A ∩ Hϕ), where

Hϕ = {α ∈ Aut(R)k : ∃w ∈ Fk, ∀x ∈ d(ϕ), α(w)x = ϕx}.

Since A ∩ Hϕ’s are all open because the Hϕ’s are open in Aut(R), it suﬃces to prove that
A ∩ Hϕ is dense for all ϕ ∈ P (R).

Take an arbitrary isomorphism ϕ : A → B between ﬁnite induced subgraphs, and an arbitrary
α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ A. We need to prove that, for any F ⊂ V (R) a ﬁnite subset, there exists
β ∈ A ∩ Hϕ such that the restrictions of αj and βj coincide on F for all j. To prove this, we
may assume that F contains both V (A) and V (B).
We take such an F and, for each j = 1, . . . , k, we consider the isomorphism σj : α−1
j F ∪ F →
F ∪αjF obtained by restricting αj. Then, we apply Lemma 4.1 to σ1, . . . , σk and get a k-tuple
of extensions ¯σ = (¯σ1, . . . , ¯σk) in Aut(R)k. Let us observe that ¯σ and α coincide on F . Let us
also observe that ¯σ is in A, that is, all h¯σi-orbits are inﬁnite. Indeed, assume by contradiction
that C is a ﬁnite h¯σi-orbit. Then, for any j, the set C would be a union of ﬁnite cycles of ¯σj,
hence, for any j, the set C would be a union of ﬁnite cycles of σj, hence C would be a ﬁnite
hαi-orbit, which is impossible.

By Neumann’s Lemma, there exists w ∈ Fk such that

¯σ(w)F ∩

F ∪ [1≤j≤k

(α−1

j F ∪ αjF )


is empty. We set K = Sv ¯σ(v)F , where the union is taken over the suﬃxes of (the reduced

word representing) w. Take i such that the ﬁrst letter of the reduced word representing w
isn’t ai nor its inverse. Note that the ¯σi-cycles containg points of ¯σ(w)F are all inﬁnite,
since the ﬁnite cycles of ¯σi, which coincide with the ﬁnite cycles of σi, are contained in

j F ∪ αjF ). For s ∈ N large enough, the sets

are pairwise disjoint. The construction of ¯σ (see the proof of Lemma 4.1) ensures that the
induced subgraphs over these sets aren’t adjacent by any edge. Thus we can deﬁne a partial
graph isomorphism as follows (note that without the former property it could be only a
bijection between vertices):
i )x, so that
τ (¯σ(a−s
i′ K ∪ K, where i′ is some index distinct from i (which
exists since k ≥ 2), we set τ x = ¯σi′x.

i w)A, we set τ x = ¯σ(as

i w)B; for x ∈ ¯σ−1

i w)A) = ¯σ(as

i w)ϕ¯σ(w−1as

for x ∈ ¯σ(a−s

i w) and β(a−s

i w). Hence, one has

i w) and β(as
i w)a = ¯σ(w−1a−s

Now, one can extend τ to an automorphism βi′, and set βj = ¯σj for other indices j. Then β,
¯σ and α coincide on F . Moreover one has ¯σ(a−s
i w) coincide on F , and the same
holds for ¯σ(as
i w)a = ¯σ(w−1a−s
β(w−1a−s
i w)a = ϕa
for all a ∈ A. Finally, as βi′ coincides with ¯σi′ on ¯σ−1
i′ K ∪ K and all σi-orbits are inﬁnite
outside this set, β is again in A. Consequently, we obtain that β is in A∩Hϕ, which concludes
the proof. One can use the similar argument to show that A ∩ F is a dense Gδ in A and it is
left to the reader.
