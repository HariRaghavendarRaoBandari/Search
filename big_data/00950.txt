Introduction

The dominant paradigm in assigning “habitability” to
terrestrial planets is to deﬁne a circumstellar habitable
zone:
the locus of orbital radii in which the planet is
neither too hot nor too cold for life as we know it. One
dimensional climate models have identiﬁed theoretically
impressive boundaries for this zone: a runaway green-
house or water loss at the inner edge (Venus), and low-
latitude glaciation followed by formation of CO2 clouds
at the outer edge. A cottage industry now exists to “re-
ﬁne” the deﬁnition of these boundaries each year to the
third decimal place of an AU. Using the same class of
climate model, I show that the different climate states
can overlap very substantially and that “snowball Earth”,
moist temperate climate, hot moist climate and a post-
runaway dry climate can all be stable under the same
solar ﬂux. The radial extent of the temperate climate
band is very narrow for pure water atmospheres, but can
be widened with di-nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The
width of the habitable zone is thus determined by the at-
mospheric inventories of these gases. Yet Earth teaches
us that these abundances are very heavily inﬂuenced
(perhaps even controlled) by biology. This is paradox-
ical:
the habitable zone seeks to deﬁne the region a
planet should be capable of harbouring life; yet whether
the planet is inhabited will determine whether the cli-
mate may be habitable at any given distance from the
star. This matters, because future life detection missions
may use habitable zone boundaries in mission design.

The habitable zone and physical climate

A typical description of the “habitable zone” is the re-
gion of circumstellar space in which a planet might be
habitable. Rather by convention, the practical deﬁnition
has become the existence of liquid water, for life as we
know it (that is: Earth) relies on this.

As our conceptualization relies on the existence of
on a certain phase of a certain chemical, our problem
becomes ﬁnding the conditions of the physical climate of
a planet which would put the surface and atmosphere in
a desirable region of the pressure–temperature space of
the phase diagram. Necessarily, we need to consider all
three phases (all exist on Earth). This becomes a rather
rich problem, for the different phases interact differently
with electromagnetic radiation. There are, therefore,
various climate feedbacks which express through water.

vious numerical results[1, 2]

The framework of dynamical systems theory be-
comes fundamental, as climate state depends on history;
our task is to look for stable steady states of climate. To
make progress, we can separately consider the fate of
solar photons incident on Earth which may transfer en-
ergy to us, and the escape of thermally emitted photons
which transfer energy away. Where energy ﬂuxes are
equal, there exists a steady state. Steady states which
are stable to a small perturbation are habitable zone can-
didates. Thus, in Figures 1 and 2, we derive bifurcation
diagrams for Earth’s climate, mapping climate states as
a function of circumstellar distance. There exist ice-
covered, temperate moist, hot moist and hot dry climate
states. The moist states both enjoy liquid water sur-
faces, but the sea-level temperature conditions are only
favourable for life-as-we-know-it in the temperate moist
state.

spheres and those without. The planets with atmo-
spheres are simply those which have not lost them. This
can be seen clearly on the “Zahnle diagram”: with axis of
escape velocity (planet mass) and solar heating, a simple
power law empirically separates the two classes[4, 5].
Carbon Dioxide

There are two end member cases of how a planet
may store a carbon dioxide reservoir, represented in our
solar system by Earth and Venus. On Earth, there is a
small atmospheric reservoir and a larger ocean reservoir,
but the vast majority of oxidized carbon is stored in
carbonate rocks. On Venus, the atmospheric carbon
dioxide inventory is roughly equivalent to the contents
of Earth’s carbonate rocks, but there is neither an ocean
inventory (as there is no ocean) nor any evidence of
carbonate rocks.

Let us consider how oxidized carbon is partitioned
between reservoirs on an Earth-like planet. The par-
tial pressure of atmospheric CO2 and the dissolved con-
centration in the ocean are in direct proportion, de-
scribed by Henry’s Law. But dissolved CO2 is not
the major reservoir; in aqueous solution, the dissolu-
tion products of carbonic acid, bicarbonate ion and car-
bonate ion, will often be larger reservoirs. Conserva-
tion of mass is described via Dissolved Inorganic Car-
bon (DIC = [CO2] + [HCO–
3 ]). Conservation of
change of weak acids occurs through alkalinity, which
balances net positive change from salts (Alk = [HCO–
3] +
3 ] + . . . = [Na+]−[Cl–] + [Mg2+] + [Ca2+] + . . .). For
2 [CO2–
some DIC, alkalinity will control the partitioning be-
tween different reservoirs; low alkalinity requires high
3 ], high alkalinity the opposite. At in-
[CO2] and low [CO2–
termediate alkalinity [HCO–
3] dominates. Thus, for given
DIC, alkalinity determines the atmospheric pCO2 and
thus climate (Figure 3).

3] + [CO2–

Plant roots increase soil pCO2 and secrete organic

acids which will dissolve rock.

In the ocean, high alkalinity means that [CO2–

3 ] will
increase to the point where precipitation of CaCO3 is
thermodynamically favoured, and precipitation removes
both DIC and alkalinity. Thus, the consequence of an
alkalinity ﬂux from weathering is removal of inorganic
carbon from the atmosphere-ocean system and deposi-
tion in rock. The saturation product Ω = ([Ca+][CO2–
3 ])sat
describes when precipitation is thermodynamically favoured,
but this is kinetically inhibited. Authigenic (abiological)
precipitation requires Ω = 30, but on Earth biology rules
the roost yet again as organisms that build calcium car-
bonate shells are able to do so at Ω = 3. Just as biology
enhances weathering, it enhances carbonate deposition,
and living Earth has lower pCO2 than her sterile equiva-
lent would.

Carbonate rocks will ultimate be destroyed through
metamorphism, either of during subduction of ocean
crust or in regional metamorphism of carbonate rocks
uplifted to the continents. This recycled carbon con-
tributes a larger part of the oft-referred to “volcanic

temperature via the Clausius-Claperon equation), I defer
to descriptions in my previous papers[3, 1, 2]. Herein,
the focus is on how variation in atmospheric composition
modiﬁes these.

Gases may be separated into radiatively active and
background gases. The former absorb photons directly,
and the most important subset of these, greenhouse gases,
does so in the infrared; carbon dioxide is the prototype
for Earth. The latter absorb little radiation directly but
will broaden the absorption of the radiative gases and
scatter solar photons; di-nitrogen is the prototype for
Earth.

More background gas means less energy absorbed
from the Sun because of higher albedo, and less or more
thermal energy emitted depending on temperature (less
at low temperatures where pressure-broadening is dom-
inant, more at intermediate temperature where dilution
of water aloft lowers the emission level). Consequent is
the wet temperate climate state moving to higher solar
constants and broadening: the habitable zone is wider
and further from the Sun.

More greenhouse gas simply reduces outgoing ther-
mal radiation, and only does so signiﬁcantly at lower
temperatures. Thus the wet temperate climate state is
moved to lower solar constants and is broader: the hab-
itable zone is wider and nearer to the Sun.

Controls on atmospheric composition

Is there an atmosphere?

carbon” source than juvenile carbon. Geological pro-
cesses are thus involved in the partitioning between
atmosphere-ocean and solid planet reservoirs.

Now, the transition to Venus: ﬁrst, the deposition
of carbonates is aqueous, so with the evaporation and
loss of the oceans none can be deposited; second, at
high temperatures, calcium carbonate will break down
CaCO3 −−→ CaO + CO2. This reaction is operated indus-
trially on Earth in lime kilns. The required temperature
of around 1200K is quite reasonable for the surface of
Venus in a runaway greenhouse (the hot dry state) before
water is lost to space.

In summary, to understand the ﬁrst order controls
of atmospheric CO2, one must understand planetary cli-
mate, ocean chemistry, surface weathering processes and
the action of life.

Di-nitrogen

The geological cycle of nitrogen, hence the possi-
ble variation of atmospheric di-nitrogen inventory, have
long been under-appreciated. However, modern whole-
Earth nitrogen budgets suggest that Earth’s mantle con-
tains more nitrogen than the atmosphere and that mantle
nitrogen is of subduction origin. An atmospheric mass
worth of nitrogen can be subducted in around a billion
years, so variations in the atmospheric budget have to be
considered [1, 7].

This mantle nitrogen is biological in origin. The

only way that large amounts of di-nitrogen can be ﬁxed
is through biological nitrogen ﬁxation, to make ammo-
nium (NH+
4). Ammonium has a similar ionic radius to
potassium ion, so will readily substitute into K-rich min-
erals (particularly clays). Stable in a geological setting,
it may then be subducted. Noble gas isotopes indicate
that the mantle nitrogen (one to a few times the amount
in the atmosphere) is indeed of subducted origin, and
not primordial.

As with carbon dioxide, there is a prima facia case
that a mix of biological, geochemical and geological
processes control the atmospheric inventory.

Water

Water may be somewhat unique amongst the atmo-
spheric gases in that its controls do appear to be physical,
dominated by evaporation-condensation: warmer tem-
peratures leads directly to higher partial pressure. Feed-
back processes in interaction with the radiation ﬁeld give
rise to the number of climate states discussed above.

There are other considerations though. Existence of
an ocean requires: initial delivery of water to a planet
inside the snowline; failure to lose that ocean via hy-
drogen escape; failure to subduct all water to the mantle
through hydration and subduction of rocks (which does
happen to an extent on Earth).

Were Earth to have only water in its atmosphere, it would
today exist perilously close to both the inner and outer
bounds of the conventionally deﬁned habitable zone.
In dynamical systems terms, there are several overlap-
ping stable steady states of climate near present solar
constant. The state with liquid water and modest tem-
perature is narrow.

Expanding the habitable zone requires other gases in
the atmosphere: conceptually, a greenhouse gas when
there is little incoming sunlight and a background gas to
either scatter sunlight when that is abundant, or broaden
the absorption of greenhouse gasses when sunlight is
scarce. The boundaries of the climate states are deter-
mined by atmospheric physics with abundances of these
gases as a free parameter. On Earth, appeals to phys-
ical feedbacks to control carbon dioxide or di-nitrogen
inventories fail: those free parameters are controlled by
geology, geochemistry and life itself.

Life, we see, has entered the business of controlling
the boundaries of its own habitat in space and time,
niche construction in ecological parlance. As we view
Gaia through the atmosphere, we see that habitability
and inhabitance are inseparable.
