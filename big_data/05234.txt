(Dated: March 17, 2016)

The recent detection by Advanced LIGO of gravitational waves (GW) from the merging of a
binary black hole system sets new limits on the merging rates of massive primordial black holes
(PBH) that could be a signiﬁcant fraction or even the totality of the dark matter in the Universe.
aLIGO opens the way to the determination of the distribution and clustering of such massive PBH.
If PBH clusters have a similar density to the one observed in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, we ﬁnd
merging rates comparable to aLIGO expectations. Massive PBH dark matter predicts the existence
of thousands of those dwarf galaxies where star formation is unlikely because of gas accretion onto
PBH, which would possibly provide a solution to the missing satellite and too-big-to-fail problems.
Finally, we study the possibility of using aLIGO and future GW antennas to measure the abundance
and mass distribution of PBH in the range [5 - 200] M⊙ to 10% accuracy.

Understanding the nature of Dark Matter (DM), ac-
counting for about one third of the energy density of
the Universe, is one of the most important challenges in
cosmology nowadays. The existence of Dark Matter is
supported by plenty of observations, such as the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, the distri-
bution of large scale structures, the stability of massive
galaxy clusters and collisions among them, the weak and
strong gravitational lensing, the rotation curves of galax-
ies, etc. A popular hypothesis is that DM is composed of
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP’s). How-
ever, in the absence of a clear signal from direct or indi-
rect WIMP interactions, possible alternatives should be
considered.

For instance, DM could be composed partially or to-
tally of Primordial Black Holes (PBH) [1–7]. These could
have formed in the early universe due to the collapse
of large density ﬂuctuations, e.g.
induced by a water-
fall phase during inﬂation [4, 8–10] , by a ﬁrst-order
phase transition [11] or in some curvaton scenarios [12–
14]. Like a WIMP, a PBH is non-relativistic and ef-
fectively collisionless and is thus a perfect DM candi-
date. PBHs must be heavy enough not to evaporate in
a time shorter than the age of the Universe, which is
fulﬁlled if their mass is mPBH >
Very stringent constraints have been set on their abun-
dances, from various observations: if mPBH <
the gamma-ray radiation due to PBH evaporation should
have been detected by EGRET and FERMI [15]; within
the range 5 × 1014 − 1017 kg, they should have been de-
tected by FERMI through the gravitational femto-lensing
of gamma-ray bursts [16]; for 1015 < mPBH < 1021 kg

∼ 5 × 1011 kg [2, 15].
∼ 7×1012 kg,

PBHs should have destroyed neutron stars in globular
clusters [17]; the absence of microlensing events of stars in
the Magellanic clouds exclude large abundances of PBHs
within the range 1023 − 1031 kg [18–20]. Their abun-
dance in the early Universe is also well constrained by
the absence of important spectral distortions of the CMB
black-body spectrum, which excludes PBH as dark mat-
ter if mPBH >
range of possible PBH masses, therefore most people of-
ten considers the model as ruled out.

∼ M⊙ [21]. This last constraint closes the

However, as was pointed out recently in Ref. [8], the
merging of PBHs could have been very eﬃcient in the
early Universe, such that initially substellar mass black
holes, passing the CMB distortion constraints, could have
grown by several orders of magnitude, enough to evade
the most stringent microlensing constraints. In this way,
the galactic halo would be populated by a large number
of massive PBHs, which is supported by the recent obser-
vation of numerous BH candidates in the central region of
Andromeda [22–26]. In addition, distortion constraints
are the result of complex processes, like the radiation
feedback on the accretion rate and the spatial extension
of the energy deposit, and therefore they are subject of
important uncertainties.
In the case of a broad PBH
mass spectrum, covering a few orders of magnitude, the
high-mass tail of the distribution provides a subdominant
number of very massive PBHs, which could initiate struc-
ture formation and, in particular, are good candidates
for the seeds of the Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBH)
observed at the center of galaxies, as well as for the Inter-
mediate Mass Black Holes (IMBH), expected to be the
origin of the observed ultra-luminous X-ray sources [27–
31]. The recent observation of one of those IMBH in the
central region of the Milky-Way [32] could be a hint in
favor of abundant IMBHs, beyond what is expected via
stellar evolution.

In this letter, we examine the possibility that the

∼ 30M⊙ BH merger at the origin of the ﬁrst direct detec-
tion of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO [33] has
a Dark Matter origin in the form of PBHs. More gener-
ally, we explore how the new bounds set by aLIGO on
the rate of massive BH merging [34] can be satisﬁed by
a massive PBH-DM model. Two cases are distinguished:
ﬁrst, the PBHs are uniformly distributed in galactic halos
and follow Einasto or Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) pro-
ﬁles; second, PBHs are clustered in compact sub-halos.
In both cases we compute the merger rate and evaluate
the total expected annual number of events in the range
of aLIGO. We also evaluate the typical size and density
of those PBH sub-halos leading to a merging rate within
the range of 2− 400 yr−1Gpc−3 inferred from aLIGO ob-
servations [34]. Upon completion of our work, S. Bird
et al.
released a very similar analysis [35]. Here we
conﬁrm in an independent way their claim that aLIGO
could have detected PBH-DM in the case that black holes
are clustered. Our study nevertheless diﬀers from that
of Ref. [35] and extends it in several ways: (i) instead
of considering a concentration-mass relation for DM ha-
los extrapolating N-body simulations, associated with a
speciﬁc redshift dependence, which explicitly assumes a
nearly-scale invariant power spectrum of density ﬂuctua-
tions, we assume that PBH could have already clustered
in the early Universe; (ii) we extend their analysis by
considering the case of a broad distribution of the PBH
mass spectrum; (iii) we provide a mechanism for generat-
ing such initially clustered PBH in the context of hybrid
inﬂation with a mild-waterfall phase; (iv) based on sim-
ple arguments, we check that both CMB distortions and
micro-lensing constraints are evaded in our model; (v)
we discuss the implications of our results for the miss-
ing satellites and too-big-to-fail problems, which could
be solved naturally if PBH-DM are mostly concentrated
in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in which the formation of
long-living stars is improbable due to the high density of
PBHs.

First, we have evaluated the expected annual number
of merging events, in the case where massive PBHs ac-
count for the totality of DM and follow a uniform Einasto
or NFW distribution in the Milky-Way halo. We fo-
cus ﬁrst on the ideal case that all PBHs have the same
mass, namely mPBH = 30M⊙, but this assumption is
actually of little importance because our results for the
total merging rate are found to be independent on the
PBH mass. Those results suggest that a uniform dis-
tribution cannot account for the inferred rate of mas-
sive BH mergers by aLIGO. We then focus on the case
where PBHs are clustered in dense sub-halos, that could
be identiﬁed with ultra-faint dwarf satellite galaxies, for
which typical masses and sizes are evaluated in order to
satisfy this rate. Our results are then extended to the
case of a broad mass distribution of PBHs, as predicted
by Ref. [8]. Finally, we investigate the implications of
the scenario for some of the small-scale problems of the
ΛCDM model and discuss perspectives of future observa-
tions of mergers with gravitational waves detectors such

2

as aLIGO and VIRGO, and of microlensing events with
GAIA. Our analysis also demonstrates that sub-stellar
PBHs initially clustered in dense halos could have grown
by several orders of magnitudes via merging over the cos-
mic history, and thus naturally evade both constraints
from CMB distortions and microlensing.

Uniform distribution in the Milky-Way Halo: We have
assumed that the galactic DM density follows an Einasto
proﬁle [36],

ρ(r) =

ρ−2

e2n[(r/r−2)1/n−1]

(1)

∼ n <

where r−2 is the radius at which the logarithmic slope
It is equivalent to the radius
of the proﬁle equals −2.
Rs of the common NFW proﬁle, whereas the density pa-
rameter ρ−2 ≡ ρ(r−2) = ρS/4. Typical values from DM
simulations for massive halos, like the Milky-Way halo
for which r−2 ≈ 20 kpc, give 4 <
∼ 7. The case n = 4
is considered below, but it has been checked that diﬀer-
ent values only aﬀect marginally the results. We also
assume that PBHs follow a Maxwellian distribution with
average velocity ¯v = 200 km/s. Varying those param-
eters in a reasonable way would have a rather limited
impact on the merging rate, so for simplicity they are
kept constant throughout the paper.
In the case PBH
are uniformly distributed within the galactic halo, i.e.
they are not clustered, one can compute the typical dis-
tance between two PBHs as a function of the radial dis-
tance to the galactic center, DPBH(r) ≡ n−1/3
PBH (r) where
nPBH is the PBH number density.
It goes from a few
to one hundred kiloparsecs for PBH masses in the range
10 <
∼ 100, corresponding to number den-
sities going from 10−2pc−3 in the central region of the
galaxy, down to 10−6pc−3 far from the center, as shown
on Fig. 1.

In order to calculate the merging rate, we have referred
to Refs. [37, 38] where the capture cross-section σcapt
of two black-holes in dense clusters has been calculated.
Two encountering BHs become bounded to each other if
the energy lost in the form of gravitational waves is of the
order of the kinetic energy. Once gravitationally bounded
to each other, the two BH quickly merge in less than a
million years [35]. In the Newtonian approximation, this
capture rate τ capt
PBH ≡ nPBH ¯v σcapt
PBH of a BH of mass mA
by a BH of mass mB is given by [38]

PBH = (2π) nPBH(mA)¯v (cid:18) 85π

where vrel is the relative velocity of the two BHs, which
we take equal to ¯v. Since the cross-section is much larger
than the BH surface area, the Newtonian approximation
is accurate. The capture rate can be compared to the
direct merging rate τ merg
PBH , which was derived in the New-
tonian approximation in Refs. [17, 39] respectively in the

context of WIMP-neutron star and PBH-neutron star
collisions, assuming that two PBH merge if the closest
distance between them is smaller than the Schwarzschild
radius RPBH = 2GmPBH/c2. This rate is given by

PBH = nPBH(mA)(cid:18) 3

The direct merging and capture rates have the same mass
dependance and are represented on Fig. 1 as a func-
tion of the radial distance to the galactic center, for
mA = mB = 30M⊙. The capture rate is ∼ 170 times
larger than the direct merging rate. General relativistic
corrections could enhance the direct merging rate by a
factor of a few, as noticed in Ref. [39], but nevertheless
merging through direct collisions can be considered as
a subdominant process. Nevertheless individual capture
rates are found to be lower than 10−19yr−1. Integrating
over all the PBHs inside the galactic halo, one gets the
total rate in our galaxy, τgal ≈ 5 × 10−12yr−1. This rate
is comparable to the probability of star collisions within
the galactic disk. It is very low, and is found to be in-
dependent of the mass of PBHs. The exact shape of the
density proﬁle is of little importance, similar results being
obtained for the common NFW proﬁle, with variations in
the merging rate not exceeding a few percents. Therefore
one can conclude that if PBH are uniformly distributed in
the halos of galaxies, the model passes all the present and
future constraints from gravitational wave experiments.
This also conﬁrms that PBHs are eﬀectively collisionless,
as expected for a good dark matter candidate.

Clustering in sub-halos: Depending on the process of
formation, as well as on the evolution of cosmic inho-
mogeneities, it is possible that nowadays massive PBHs
are regrouped in dense clusters, whose size could range
from a few to a few hundreds parsecs. Early cluster-
ing of PBHs is expected e.g.
in the scenario proposed
in Ref. [8], in which quantum diﬀusion close to a tachy-
onic instability in hybrid inﬂation leads to diﬀerent per-
turbation dynamics during the subsequent mild-waterfall
phase [40, 41]. As a result, the formation of PBHs is ex-
pected to occur in localized regions during the radiation
era [42]. Another possibility is that PBH have clustered
during the cosmic history, following the non-linear evo-
lution of DM ﬂuctuations and leading naturally to the
formation of ultra-faint, mostly DM dominated, dwarf
galaxies. The Advanced LIGO gravitational waves detec-
tor is able to probe massive PBH merging over a range of
several hundreds of Mpc. Such a volume contains hun-
dreds of thousands galaxies, regrouped in galaxy clusters
and ﬁlaments, and thus also potentially millions of dense
PBH sub-halos. The inferred BH mergers rates set by
aLIGO lies the range 2 − 400 yr−1Gpc−3. It is therefore
very well motivated to explore the observational conse-
quences of locally high PBH densities, in particular the
enhancement of the merging rate.

We shall show here that a PBH-DM model with im-
portant clustering could reach such merging rates. For

(solid lines) and direct merging (dashed lines) rates (bottom)
for a massive PBH-DM model, uniformly distributed within
the Milky-Way halo with an Einasto proﬁle, and for several

this purpose one can use directly Eq. 2 with a local num-
ber density nPBH = Efactor × ¯ρDM/mPBH, with ¯ρDM =
ΩDMρcr being the mean cosmological DM density today.

refer to as merging rate) is given by

and that the total rate per Gpc3 is

independently of the PBH mass.1 Therefore, a huge en-
hancement factor, Efactor ∼ 109(1010), is typically re-
quired to produce a few (a few tens of) events per year,

1 A factor fDM is included to consider the possibility that clustered
PBHs account for only a fraction of the dark matter. The case
fDM = 1 is discussed thereafter, but since it simply rescales the
total merger rate it is straightforward to extend our results to
the case fDM < 1.

inside the range of Advanced LIGO. For mPBH ≃ 30M⊙
this corresponds to a local number density of ∼ 1 (∼ 10)
PBHs per cubic parsec. The PBH density is compara-
ble to the one of DM in globular clusters, the one of
DM-dominated - with a mass to light ratio approach-
ing ∼ 1000 - ultra-faint dwarf galaxies detected by
Keck/DEIMOS [43, 44] and is not far from the density
inside the compact clusters observed around a nearby
galaxy [45]. The existence of hundreds of those ultra-
faint dwarf satellite galaxies, possibly DM-dominated,
has been recently inferred by the DES collaboration [46].
Interestingly, the Keck ultra-faint galaxies [43, 44] have
a total mass of 106 − 107M⊙ for radii ranging from a few
tens to a few hundreds of parsecs, which therefore ﬁts
well with the required density to reproduce the merger
rate inferred by Advanced LIGO. With such densities,
we predict the existence of thousands of those ultra-faint
dwarf satellites.

Missing satellite problem: N-body simulations of the
ΛCDM problem predict that there should exist numer-
ous of such dwarf satellite galaxies, that are not observed
in visible light, which is referred to as the missing satel-
lite problem. Another problem of the ΛCDM model, re-
ferred as the too-big-to-fail problem, is that large sub-
structures, if present, lead to massive star formation and
therefore should have been detected. The simplest so-
lution to those problems would be that numerical simu-
lations accounting for baryonic physics explain well the
observations [47, 48]. This is however until now con-
troversial, and possible exotic solutions have been ex-
plored, such as dark radiation and interacting dark mat-
ter [49]. Another solution is that ultra-faint dwarf galax-
ies account for this missing satellite population [44]. The
scenario of a PBH-DM could provide an explanation to
the existence of those DM-dominated ultra-faint galax-
ies: because of the high local density of massive PBHs,
these could accrete all the baryonic matter in a very small
time, preventing the formation of a huge number of stars.

Broad PBH mass spectrum: We now focus on the case
PBHs follow a broad distribution of masses. For simplic-
ity we have considered a lognormal distribution of the
PBH (local) density, with a central mass µPBH and a
width σPBH,

As before, the enhancement factor models how PBHs are
clustered, with enhanced local densities. Such a distri-
bution is expected e.g. in the scenario of Ref. [8]. If the
PBH distribution covers several orders of magnitude in
masses, then a subdominant number of very massive BHs
are produced, that could be the seeds of the SMBHs at
the center of galaxies, as well as of the IMBHs responsible
for ultra-luminous X-ray sources.

We have calculated and represented on Fig. 2 the merg-
ing rate of PBHs with a minimal mass mmin = 1M⊙, and
a maximal mass mmax = µPBH + 103σPBH, as a function
of the width σPBH of the lognormal PBH density distri-
bution, for several values of the enhancement factor and
of the central mass µPBH.
Increasing the width of the
mass spectrum enhances the merging rate, whereas the
enhancement factor rescales the merging rate linearly. In
order to accommodate a merging rate ranging from a few
to a few hundreds events per year and per Gpc3, we ﬁnd
that 109 <
∼ 1011 if the width of the distribution
is negligible, and 106 <
∼ 108 if σPBH ≈ 2. As
expected, in the small width limit, the merging rate is in-
dependent of the central mass µPBH. But we ﬁnd that for
σPBH >
∼ 0.5, the merging rate becomes mass dependent
and is more important for large values of µPBH. Those re-
sults assume a constant density inside PBH clusters, but
a reﬁned treatment should include particular proﬁles for
the PBH distribution inside sub-halos, which would be
obtained by convolving Eq. (8) with some motivated pro-
ﬁle for DM sub-halos [36], like Einasto’s one [50]. More
realistic velocity distributions should also be considered.
One can also study how the merging events are dis-
tributed as a function of the two progenitor masses mA

∼ Efactor <

and mB. Fig. 3 displays the merging rate computed for
typical parameter values and values of mA and mB rang-
ing from 5M⊙ to 100M⊙, with mass bins of width 5M⊙.
With a nominal PBH mass µPBH = 30M⊙ and a small
width σPBH ≃ 0.1 events involving one PBH with a dif-
ferential in the mass ±10M⊙ are very unlikely. On the
contrary, with a width σPBH ≃ 0.3 it would be possible
to observe events involving two PBHs with a big mass
diﬀerential. Increasing the width up to σPBH ≃ 1, one
observes that the most likely events come from the less
massive PBHs (of a few solar masses), because the num-
ber density of PBHs nPBH ≡ ρPBH/mPBH peaks on those
scales. Considering such a broad spectrum, one actually
needs µPBH ∼ 5000M⊙ in order to get a number den-
sity, as well as a merging rate, peaking on a few tens of
solar masses. Notice, however, that in this case, in or-
der to get a total merging rate in the range inferred by
aLIGO, one needs to boost the enhancement factor up to
Efactor ∼ 1013 − 1014, i.e.
local densities corresponding
to extreme astrophysical environments such as the cores
of some globular clusters. Therefore, under the hypoth-
esis that most PBH-DM are concentrated in ultra-faint-
dwarf galaxies of the size and density of those that have
been observed, corresponding to an enhancement factor
Efactor ∼ 109 − 1010, such a broad distribution centered
on very massive PBH can be considered as very unlikely.
Those considerations lead us to the conclusion that if
Advanced LIGO or other gravitational wave experiments
detect in the next few years a large number (>
merging events, involving massive BHs without an opti-
cal or neutrino counterparts, we should be able to recon-
struct the PBH mass spectrum (with ∼ 10% accuracy)
as well as their possible local density environments and
the fraction of dark matter they can account for.

Summary and discussion: The detection by aLIGO of
gravitational waves emitted by the merging of two mas-
sive BHs opens a new way to probe the abundance, the
clustering and the mass distribution of PBHs. The merg-
ing rates expected for various local densities and mass
distributions have been calculated and compared to the
bounds 2−400 Gpc−3 yr−1 inferred by aLIGO, in the case
PBHs have the right abundance for being the dark mat-
ter. A uniform distribution of PBHs inside galactic halos
cannot reproduce such high rates. But we ﬁnd that if
PBHs are clustered in sub-halos with densities compara-
ble to the one of DM-dominated ultra-faint dwarf galax-
ies, the merging rate lies precisely within that range. We
suggest a model where PBHs are massive – a few tens of
solar masses – and have a broad mass spectrum, like the
one generated by hybrid inﬂation with a mild waterfall
phase [8], such that a subdominant number of very mas-
sive PBHs can be the seeds of galaxies and, in particular,

5

of the SMBH at the center of galaxies, as well as of the
IMBHs expected to be at the origin of ultra-luminous
X-ray sources.

Such a PBH-DM model, in which an important frac-
tion of PBHs are clustered in dwarf galaxies, would
have interesting observational consequences and could
solve the long-standing missing satellite and too-big-to-
fail problems of ΛCDM cosmology, if locally high BH
number densities prevent important star formation. Fi-
nally, by studying the merging rates with diﬀerent pro-
genitor masses in the range 5 − 100M⊙, we ﬁnd that the
detection of thousands of merging events by aLIGO or fu-
ture GW detectors would allow to reconstruct the PBH
mass spectrum with relatively good accuracy.

The model proposed here passes all the stringent con-
straints on PBH abundances, including CMB distortions,
if PBHs have signiﬁcantly merged at early times in order
to acquire large masses today. Using Eqs. (2) and (7)
we have checked this can be achieved for initially sub-
stellar masses and a relatively broad distribution, under
the condition that PBH velocities were much lower than
today, ¯v ∼ m/s, in order to boost the rate of absorp-
tion of a sub-stellar PBH by a more massive one up to
τ ∼ 10−8yr−1. The detailed study of the merging history
is left for future work, as well as the calculation of the
associated stochastic background of gravitational waves.
If Dark Matter is indeed made of massive PBHs, the
energy released by merging in the form of gravitational
waves could reach a non-negligible fraction of the critical
density today, and the (decaying) DM fraction could have
evolved during cosmic history, leading to observable sig-
natures in the CMB and LSS. Moreover, constraints from
the absence of microlensing of stars in the Magellanic
clouds are evaded due to the large mass of PBHs. Fur-
thermore, if PBHs are clustered in dwarf satellite galax-
ies, then the probability to ﬁnd one of them in the line
of sight of the Large Magellanic Cloud is less than a part
in a thousand, and thus we argue that a model where
an important fraction of PBHs have a sub-stellar mass
is still allowed. Finally, the GAIA experiment should set
new bounds on PBH abundances from anomalous mo-
tions of stars, and should be able to distinguish between
the diﬀerent cases: clustered/unclustered, sharp/broad
mass spectrum. This line of research will be pursued
further in future work.

FIG. 3. Merging rates of BHs with masses mA and mB, the color scale representing log(τ yr Gpc3). The PBH density
follows a lognormal distribution in logarithmic mass scale, of central value µPBH and width σPBH. The top panels are for
µPBH = 30M⊙ and σPBH = 0.1 (left) and σPBH = 0.3 (right). The bottom panels are for σPBH = 1 and µPBH = 30M⊙ (left)
and µPBH = 5000M⊙. In this latter case, the PBH number density peaks on mPBH ∼ 30M⊙. The corresponding enhancement
factor and total merging rate of BHs with masses mPBH >

∼ 5M⊙ is indicated above each panel.
