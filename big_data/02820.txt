Abstract

We deﬁne a Lie bracket on a certain set of variation vector ﬁelds along a null curve in a

4-dimensional semi-Riemannian space form. This Lie bracket will be employed to study integra-

bility properties of evolution equations for null curves in a pseudo-Euclidean space. In particular,

a geometric recursion operator generating inﬁnite many local symmetries for the null localized

induction equation is provided.

Keywords. Curve evolution; Null curve; Lie algebra; Integrability; Hirota-Satsuma system.

1 Introduction

Recently in [1, 2] a connection between the local motion of a null curve in L3 and the celebrated
KdV equation was given. In [3] the author obtained a connection between a null curve evolution in
L4 (to which we refer to as the “null localized induction equation” or NLIE), and the Hirota-Satsuma
coupled KdV (HS-cKdV) system, which we remind here brieﬂy. Hirota and Satsuma [4] proposed
(perhaps up to rescaling) the HS-cKdV system

ut =

1

uxxx + 3uux − 6vvx,

vt = −vxxx − 3uvx,

(1)

which describes the interactions of two long waves with diﬀerent dispersion relations. Many sys-
tematic methods have been employed in the literature to clarify the integrability of the HS-cKdV
system: the Lax pair [5, 6, 7], the Bäcklund transformation method [8], the Darboux transformation
[9, 10, 11], the Painlevé analysis [6, 7], the search of inﬁnitely many symmetries and conservation
laws [4, 12, 13], etc. Fuchssteiner [12] discovered that HS-cKdV system given by (1) admits the

Furthermore, an inﬁnite hierarchy of symmetries for (1) was found in [13],

σ1 = (

σ0 = (ux, vx);

uxxx + 3uux − 6vvx,−vxxx − 3uvx);

{σ2n = (ΘJ)nσ0; σ2n+1 = (ΘJ)nσ1} .
(4)
In this case the recursion operator ΘJ is not hereditary. Hence, the bi-Hamiltonian formulation of
the HS-cKdV system does not arise from a Hamiltonian pair.

In this paper, we extend some of the results given in [1, 2, 3] to a more general background. More
speciﬁcally, we generalize the Lie algebra structure deﬁned on the local variation vector ﬁelds along
null curves from the 3-dimensional Minkowski space to 4-dimensional semi-Riemannian space forms
M 4
q (G) of index q = 1 or q = 2 and curvature G. This Lie algebra together with the properties about
the HS-cKdV system described above will be used to construct an inﬁnity hierarchy of commuting
symmetries for the NLIE equation in a 4-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space.

It is interesting to point out that, from a physical point of view, the 4-dimensional space is a more
realistic context than the 3-dimensional background, the latter very often serving merely as a toy
model. Let us recall that relativistic particles models have been described by actions deﬁned on null
curves whose Lagrangians are functions of their curvatures [14, 15]. These actions were also studied
in Minkowski spaces L3 and L4 (see [16, 17]), as well as in 3-dimensional Lorentzian space forms in
[18]. All these works were addressed to study variational problems on null curve spaces, and they
have shown that the underlying mechanical system is governed by a stationary system of Korteweg-
De Vries type. Furthermore, if γ(σ, 0) is a critical point (the so-called null elastica) for the action

cR k dσ, where c is a constant, then the associated solution γ(σ, t) to the NLIE starting from γ(σ, 0)

is the null elastica evolving by rigid motions in the direction X = 1
2 kT + N, where X is actually
the rotational Killing vector ﬁeld for the null elastica (see [16, 18]), and it served to determine the
benchmark for the evolution equation NLIE in [1]. This idea was originally explored by Hasimoto
between the elastica (an equilibrium shape of an elastic rod) and the “localized induction equation”
(LIE). As might be expected, relationships with the Korteweg-De Vries evolution systems still arise
when the null curve motions in 4-dimensional backgrounds are considered.

One of the many advantages of having a scalar evolution equation coming from a curve motion is
that many aspects of its integrability can be elucidated from the intrinsic geometry of the involved
curves (see [19, 20]). Conversely, integrability properties of the curvature ﬂow can be employed to
determine integrability properties of the curve evolution equation (see [1, 21, 22, 23]). Despite the
numerous well-known connections between curve evolution equations and integrable Hamiltonian

2

systems of PDEs, there is still a lack of understanding about the mechanisms and links among the
diﬀerent frameworks. Our overall aim here is to go further into those concerns.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we summarize some basic notions
about formal variational calculus on which the Hamiltonian theory of nonlinear evolution equations
is based.
In section 3 we have included some background formulas and results concerning the
diﬀerential geometry of null curves in a semi-Riemannian space form. In particular, we study the
properties of variation vector ﬁelds along a null curve in a semi-Riemannian space form as well as the
variational formulas for its curvatures. In section 4, the Lie bracket on the set of P-local variation
vector ﬁelds locally preserving the causal character along null curves in a 3-dimensional Lorentzian
space given in [1] is extended to 4-dimensional semi-Riemannian space forms. This section also
includes a discussion about the connection between the geometric variational formulas for curvatures
and the Hamiltonian structure for the HS-cKdV system. The above results will be employed in
section 5 to introduce the NLIE equation as a geometric realization of HS-cKdV equations, and to
construct a geometric recursion operator generating an inﬁnity hierarchy of commuting symmetries
for the NLIE equation.

2 Preliminaries

In this section we summarize some necessary notions and basic deﬁnitions from diﬀerential calculus
which are relevant to the rest of the paper (see [24, 25, 26] for a very complete treatment of the
subject). Let n be a positive integer and consider u1, u2, . . . , un diﬀerentiable functions in the real
variable x. Set

u(m)
i =

dmui
dxm ,

for m ∈ N, i ∈ {1, . . . , n} .

Let P be the algebra of polynomials in u1, u2, . . . , un and their derivatives of arbitrary order,

namely,

P = R[u(m)

i

: m ∈ N, i ∈ {1, . . . , n}].

We refer to the elements of P whose constant term vanishes as P0. Acting on the algebra P is
deﬁned a derivation ∂ obeying

thereby becoming a diﬀerential algebra.

∂(f g) = (∂f )g + f (∂g),
∂(u(m)

) = u(m+1)

,

local
Remark 1. In a more general setting we can consider P, for example, to be the algebra of
functions, i.e. P = S∞
j=1 Pj, where Pj is the algebra of locally analytic functions of u1, u2, . . . , un
and their derivatives up to order j (see [27, 28, 29, 30]). All the results and formulas established
in sections 4 and 5 involving the algebra P remain valid if the diﬀerential algebra of polynomials

3

is replaced by the diﬀerential algebra of local functions. Nonetheless, the diﬀerential algebra of

polynomials is suﬃcient for our purposes.

It is customary to take ∂ as the total derivative Dx which can be viewed as

Dx =

n

Xi=1 Xm∈N

u(m+1)
i

∂

∂u(m)

i

.

In addition to ∂, other derivations ξ may also be considered. The action of ξ is determined if we
know how ξ acts on the generators of the algebra. Indeed, set

ai,m = ξu(m)

i

,

then, for any f ∈ P we have

ξf =

n

Xi=1 Xm∈N

ai,m

∂f

∂u(m)

i

.

The space of all derivations on P, denoted by der(P), is a Lie algebra with respect to the usual
commutator

[∂1, ∂2] = ∂1∂2 − ∂2∂1,

∂1, ∂2 ∈ der(P).

Derivations commuting with the total derivative have important properties. Among others, if [ξ, ∂] =
0, we have

ai,m+1 = ξu(m+1)

i

= ξ∂u(m)

i = ∂ξu(m)

i = ∂ai,m.

Thus

n

ξf =

Xi=1 Xm∈N

a(m)

where ai = ai,0 = ξui. Let A = (a1, . . . , an) be an element of P n and write

∂A =

n

Xi=1 Xm∈N

a(m)
i

∂

∂u(m)

i

.

(5)

The set of derivations ∂A is a Lie subalgebra of der(P), and it induces a Lie algebra on the space
P n. Indeed, a direct computation shows that ∂A are derivations in P verifying [∂A, ∂B] = ∂[A,B],
where [A, B] = ∂AB − ∂BA, i.e.

[A, B]j =

(6)

This latter commutator can also be expressed with the aid of Fréchet derivatives as [A, B] = B′[A]−
A′[B], where

∂A(u + tB),

u = (u1, u2, . . . , un).

We will refer to ∂A as an evolution derivation (or a vector ﬁeld, provided that no confusion is
possible), and the algebra of all evolution derivations will be denoted by der∗(P). Observe that, in
particular, if we take A = u′ = (u′

where F = (f1, . . . , fn) is an element of P n. An element S = (s1, s2, . . . , sn) ∈ P n is called a
symmetry of the evolution equation (8) if and only if [F, S] = F ′[S] − S ′[F ] = 0. Symmetries
of integrable equations can often be generated by recursion operators which are linear operators
mapping a symmetry to a new symmetry. A linear diﬀerential operator R : P n → P n is a recursion
operator for the evolution equation (8) if it is invariant under F , i.e., LFR = 0, where LF is the
Lie derivative acting as LF A = [F, A] for all A ∈ P n. R is said to be hereditary if for an arbitrary
vector ﬁeld F ∈ P n the relation LRFR = RLFR is veriﬁed.

3 Null curve variations in M 4

q (G)

The geometry of null curves is quite diﬀerent from the non-null ones, so let us review the relevant
results, going further into what concerns us most for later work.

A semi-Riemannian manifold (M n

q , g) is an n-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold M n

q endowed
with a non-degenerate metric tensor g with signature (n − q, q). The metric tensor g will be also
denoted by h·,·i and the Levi-Civita connection by ∇. The sectional curvature of a non-degenerate
plane generated by {u, v} is

where R is the semi-Riemannian curvature tensor given by

K(u, v) =

hR(u, v)u, vi

hu, ui hv, vi − hu, vi2 ,

R(X, Y )Z = −∇X∇Y Z + ∇Y ∇X Z + ∇[X,Y ]Z.

(9)

Semi-Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature are called semi-Riemannian space
forms. It is a well-known fact that the curvature tensor R adopts a simple formula in these manifolds:

R(X, Y )Z = G{hZ, Xi Y − hZ, Y i X} ,

where G is the constant sectional curvature. When the curvature G vanishes, then M n
q
pseudo-Euclidean space and will be denoted by Rn
q .

(10)

is called

Let M 4

q (G) denote a 4-dimensional semi-Riemannian space form with index q = 1, 2, background
gravitational ﬁeld h,i and Levi-Civita connection ∇. A tangent vector v is: timelike if hv, vi < 0;
spacelike if hv, vi > 0 or v = 0; null if hv, vi = 0. Therefore, a parametrized curve γ : I → M 4
q (G)

5

is called null if its tangent vector is null at all points in the curve. Fixed a constant a > 0, we can
consider (if γ is not a geodesic) the parameter σa given by

σa(s) =

1

4 ds,

1

√aZ (cid:10)∇γ ′(s)γ′(s),∇γ ′(s)γ′(s)(cid:11)

where s is any parameter. When a = 1 this parameter agrees with the pseudo arc-length parameter
σ for the null curve. In fact, it is easy to show that σa is nothing but a linear reparametrization of
the pseudo arc-length parameter and it veriﬁes

(cid:10)∇γ ′(σa)γ′(σa),∇γ ′(σa)γ′(σa)(cid:11) = a2.

Throughout this paper it will be supposed that we have ﬁxed a constant a, σa will be denoted by
σ and we will also refer to it as the pseudo arc-length parameter. The Cartan frame of a non-geodesic
null curve γ : I → M 4
q (G), verifying that {γ′(σ), γ′′(σ), γ′′′(σ)} is linearly independent for all σ ∈ I,
is given by {T = γ′(σ), W1, N, W2}, where

hT, Ti = hN, Ni = 0,
hWi, Ti = hWi, Ni = 0,

hT, Ni = −1,
hWi, Wii = εi,

with i = 1, 2. The Cartan equations read

∇T T = aW1,
∇T W1 = −k1T + aε1N,
∇T N = −ε1k1W1 + ε2k2W2,
∇T W2 = k2T,

where ∇T denotes the covariant derivative along γ and k1, k2 are the curvatures of the curve. The
fundamental theorem for null curves tells us that k1 and k2 determine completely the null curve up
to semi-Riemannian isometries (see [31]). Even more, if functions k1 and k2 are given we can always
construct a null curve, pseudo arc-length parametrized, whose curvature functions are precisely
k1 and k2. Then any local scalar geometrical invariant deﬁned along a null curve can always be
expressed as a function of its curvatures and derivatives. A non-geodesic null curve being pseudo
arc-length parametrized and admitting a Cartan frame as above is called a Cartan curve. The bundle
given by span {W1, W2} is known as the screen bundle of γ (see [31]). Projections of the variation
vector ﬁelds onto the screen bundle will play a leading role in this research.

Let γ be a null curve, for the sake of simplicity the letter γ will also denote a variation of
null curves (null variation) γ = γ(s, t) : I × (−ζ, ζ) → M 4
q (G) with γ(s, 0) the initial null curve.
Associated with such a variation is the variation vector ﬁeld V (s) = V (s, 0), where V = V (s, t) =
∂γ
∂t (s, t). We denote by η the diﬀerentiable function verifying ∂γ
∂t the
covariant derivative along the curves γs(t) = γ(s, t). We write γ(σ, t), ki(σ, t), V (σ, t), etc., for the
corresponding objects in the pseudo arc-length parametrization.

∂s (s, t) = η(s, t)T (s, t), and by D

6

Deﬁnition 2. Let X(γ) be the set of smooth vector ﬁelds along γ. We say that V ∈ X(γ) locally
preserves the causal character if h∇T V, Ti = 0. We also say that V locally preserves the pseudo
arc-length parameter along γ if η(s, t) satisﬁes ∂η

= 0.

The following properties for null variations can be found in [17] when a = ε1 = ε2 = 1, but they

can be easily adapted to the general situation.

Lemma 3. If γ is a null variation, then its variation vector ﬁeld V veriﬁes

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

where ρV = −ε1(cid:10)∇2

h∇T V, Ti = 0;
T V, W1(cid:11).

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

Thus we obtain that V locally preserves the causal character and, moreover, V locally preserves
the pseudo arc-length parameter if and only if ρV = 0, which in such a case also entails commutation
of T and V . We deﬁne some functions that will play a key role in the rest of the paper, namely,
given a vector ﬁeld V ∈ X(γ) we consider the following projections of V and ∇T V on the screen
bundle given by

hV := ε1hV, W1i,

lV := ε2hV, W2i,

ϕV := ε1h∇T V, W1i,

ψV := ε2h∇T V, W2i.

Consider Λ the space of pseudo arc-length parametrized null curves in M 4

q (G). For γ ∈ Λ, it is
easy to see that TγΛ is the set of all vector ﬁelds associated with variations of pseudo arc-length
parametrized null curves starting from γ. It is clear that a vector ﬁeld in TγΛ locally preserves the
causal character and the pseudo arc-length parameter. The converse can also be proved applying a
similar procedure as in [2], therefore we get

TγΛ = {V ∈ X(γ) : h∇T V, Ti = h∇2

T V, W1i = 0}.

V − ε1k1gV ,

ψV = ε2h∇T V, W2i = l′

V + ε2k2gV .

(27)

Replacing fV into (27) and rearranging terms, we easily obtain (24).

From Proposition 5, a tangent vector ﬁeld V ∈ TγΛ and its covariant derivative ∇T V are

expressed by

Remark 6. Observe that a tangent vector ﬁeld V ∈ TγΛ is completely determined by the diﬀerential
functions hV and lV and two constants, since the operator D−1
is used twice; once for obtaining
σ
gV from hV and once more for obtaining fV from hV and lV . Therefore, given two diﬀerential

functions hV and lV and two constants, we can construct a vector ﬁeld locally preserving pseudo

arc-length parameter along γ whose projections on the screen bundle are precisely hV and lV . Both

constants could be determined or related if constraints on null curve variation are considered, but for

our algebraic purposes, we will consider generic constants.

4 A Lie algebra structure on variation vector ﬁelds

Our objective now is to deﬁne a Lie algebra structure on the set of local variation vector ﬁelds which
locally preserve the causal character. To this end, we need ﬁrst to set up the spaces in which we
are going to work. Let k1 and k2 be smooth functions deﬁned on an interval I and set P the real
algebra of polynomials in k1, k2 and their derivatives of arbitrary order, i.e.,

P = Rhk(m)

1

, k(n)

2

: (m, n) ∈ N2i ,

where k(m)

1 = k(m)
Let γ : I → M 4

2 = k(n)

(σ) and k(n)
q (G) be a null curve with curvatures k1 and k2, and consider the set of vector

2 (σ).

ﬁelds along γ whose components are polynomial functions

XP (γ) = {V = fV T + hV W1 + gV N + lV W2 ∈ X(γ) : fV , hV , gV , lV ∈ P}.

An element of XP (γ) will be called a P-local vector ﬁeld along γ. The set of P-local variation vector
ﬁelds (locally preserving the causal character) will be denoted by

P (γ) = {V = fV T + hV W1 + gV N + lV W2 ∈ XP (γ) : gV = −ε1aD−1
X∗

σ (hV )},

10

and within it, the P-local variation vector ﬁelds locally preserving pseudo arc-length parameter are
described as

V + ak1D−1

2a(cid:2)h′

P (γ) : fV = −

σ (hV ) − aD−1

P (γ) = {V ∈ X∗

TP,γΛ = Tγ(Λ) ∩ X∗
σ (k1hV − k2lV )(cid:3)}.
In this context, from Proposition 5 and taking into account Remark 6, we can explicitly calculate the
P-local pseudo arc-length preserving variation vector ﬁelds by means of its constants of integration.
Proposition 7. Let V be a vector ﬁeld in XP (γ), then V ∈ TP,γ(Λ) if and only if it is fulﬁlled that
σ (k1hV − k2lV ) − ε1c1k1(cid:3) + c2,
σ ◦ ∂σ = I when

fV = −

2a(cid:2)h′

where c1, c2 are constants, and ∂−1

acting on P0.

Consequently, let us consider the set

Q =(cid:8)(h, l) ∈ P 2

0 : ∃(p, q) ∈ P 2

0 such that (p′, q′) = (h, k1h − k2l)(cid:9) .

Given a pair of functions (h, l) ∈ Q and two constants c1 and c2, we will denote by X (h, l) the
P-local pseudo arc-length preserving variation vector ﬁeld

X (h, l) =(cid:18)−

1

2a(cid:2)h′ + ak1∂−1
+ hW1 +(cid:0)−ε1a∂−1

σ (h) − a∂−1
σ (h) + c1(cid:1) N + lW2.

σ (k1h − k2l) − ε1c1k1(cid:3) + c2(cid:19) T

(29)

Example 8. Consider the pair of functions (h, l) = (0, 0), then X (0, 0) =(cid:0) ε1c1
2a k1 + c2(cid:1) T + c1N . In
particular, if we take (c1, c2) = (0, b) and (c1, c2) = (−2ε1a2c, 0), where b and c are constants, one
obtains the vector ﬁelds

V0 = bT,

V1 = −ack1T − 2ε1a2cN.

The vector ﬁelds V0 and V1 will be the starting point of the commuting hierarchy of symmetries in
section 5.

Note that to introduce the concept of symmetry (and so a recursion operator) and furnish the
phase space of null curve motions with a formal variational calculus in section 5, an appropriate
Lie bracket on the set of variation vector ﬁelds should be deﬁned. To this end, we ﬁrst introduce
a convenient derivation on both the diﬀerential algebra and the variation vector ﬁelds along a
null curve. Motivated by [32] and bearing in mind Lemma 4, given V ∈ X∗
P (γ), we denote by

where αV , βV and δV are given in (13). We now restrict our deﬁnition of Lie bracket only on the set
X∗

P (γ), which will be enough for our purposes.

Proposition 9. Let γ be a null curve in Λ and consider [·,·]γ : X∗
given by

P (γ) × X∗

P (γ) → X∗

P (γ) the map

Then:

[V1, V2]γ = DV1 V2 − DV2 V1.

(a) [, ]γ is well deﬁned, i.e., if V1, V2 ∈ X∗
(b) [V1, V2]γ(f ) = V1V2(f ) − V2V1(f ) for all f ∈ P.
(c) [, ]γ is skew-symmetric.

P (γ) then [V1, V2]γ ∈ X∗

P (γ).

(d) For V1, V2 ∈ X∗

P (γ) and U ∈ XP (γ) we have
D[V1,V2]U − DV1 DV2 U + DV2 DV1 U = G (hU, V1i V2 − hU, V2i V1) .

(e) [, ]γ satisﬁes the Jacobi identity.

(f ) [, ]γ is closed for elements in TP,γ(Λ), i.e., if V, U ∈ TP,γ(Λ), then [V, U ]γ ∈ TP,γ(Λ).
Proof. Given two variation vector ﬁelds V1 = f1T + h1W1 + g1N + l1W2 and V2 = f2T + h2W1 +
g2N + l2W2 in X∗

P (γ), set V12 = [V1, V2]γ. The components g12 and h12 of V12 are given by

12 = −aε1h12. The latter is the condition equivalent to [V1, V2]γ ∈ X∗

P (γ),

thus proving (a). To prove (b), it is suﬃcient to check the same equality solely for the generators
k1 and k2 of the algebra P. We shall calculate the expressions of ϕ12, ψ12 and ρ12 (corresponding
functions to the Lie bracket [V1, V2]γ), by means of ϕi, ψi and ρi (corresponding functions to vector
ﬁelds Vi). If V = fV T + hV W1 + gV N + lV W2 ∈ XP (γ) is any vector ﬁeld, we have:

ϕV = afV + h′

After some work, it also follows from (44), (45), (46), (47) and (48) that

[V1, V2]γ(k2) = V1V2(k2) − V2V1(k2).

The paragraph (c) is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition, and (f ) is also trivial taking into account
the expression for ρ12 given in (35). The paragraph (d) follows from a straightforward computation.
Finally, to prove (e), let us denote R(V1, V2)U = D[V1,V2]U − DV1 DV2 U + DV2 DV1 U. By using (d)
we obtain

[[V1, V2], V3] + [[V2, V3], V1] + [[V3, V1], V2] = R(V1, V2)V3 + R(V2, V3)V1 + R(V3, V1)V2 = 0.

In particular, Proposition 9 entails that the set of P-local pseudo arc-length preserving variation
vector ﬁelds TP,γ(Λ) is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of the P-local variation vector ﬁelds
(X∗

P (γ), [, ]γ ).
Before turning to study the geometric hierarchies of null curve ﬂows in section 5, we point out that
equations (24) and (31) are particularly noteworthy when vector ﬁelds locally preserve the pseudo
arc-length parameter and the curvature G vanishes. Equations (24) and (31) may be rewritten as

(ϕV , ψV ) = A(hV , lV ) = (A1(hV , lV ), A2(hV , lV )) ,

(V (k1), V (k2)) = B(ϕV , ψV ) = (B1(ϕV , ψV ), B2(ϕV , ψV )) ,

It should be remarked that A and B come very close to being the symplectic and cosymplectic
operators, respectively, for (up to scaling) the Hirota-Satsuma system (see [12, 13]). Equation (49)
can also be regarded as

It is now therefore evident that J and Θ are the symplectic and cosymplectic operators respec-
tively for a rescaling of the HS-cKdV system. They have been obtained in a natural way using
projections onto the screen bundle of both, the variation vector ﬁeld V and its covariant derivative
∇T V . This allows automatically to determine the recursion operator R = Θ ◦ J, and the crucial
relation

(V (k1), V (k2)) = R(2hV ,−ε1ε2lV ).

(53)

Somewhat analogous relationships were obtained between curve evolution in 3-dimensional Rie-
mannian manifolds in [19] (or more generally in n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant
curvature in [20]) and the mKdV system. The above connection together with the availability of
the Lie bracket provided by Proposition 9 will be employed to study the integrability of null curve
evolution in the next section.

5 Geometric hierarchies of null curve ﬂows

The background given in [1] for the 3-dimensional case used to construct a commuting hierarchy
for null curve evolutions can also be well adapted to the 4-dimensional case. Consider Λ the space
of pseudo arc-length parametrized null curves in the pseudo-Euclidean space R4
q. A map f : Λ →
C∞(I, R) is referred to a scalar ﬁeld on Λ and f (γ) will be also denoted by fγ. Let A be the algebra
of P-valued scalar ﬁelds on Λ, i.e., if f ∈ A, then fγ ∈ P for all γ ∈ Λ. In this sense, we will also
understand the curvatures scalar ﬁelds k1, k2 : Λ → C∞(I, R) with its obvious meaning.

Similarly, a map V : Λ → ∪γ∈ΛTγΛ is referred to as a vector ﬁeld on Λ, and V (γ) will be
also denoted by Vγ. We shall denote the set of tangent vector ﬁelds on Λ as X(Λ), and within
we consider the subset XA(Λ) of vector ﬁelds V such that Vγ ∈ XP (γ), namely, if we denote
V = f T + hW1 + gN + lW2, then

XA(Λ) =(cid:26)V ∈ X(Λ) : f , h, g, l ∈ A; h = −

(54)

where the derivative and anti-derivative operators act on scalar ﬁelds as f ′(γ) = f ′
σ (f )(γ) =
D−1
σ (fγ) respectively. Thus XA(Λ) stands for the set of A-local vector ﬁelds locally preserving the
pseudo arc-length parameter and the causal character. These vector ﬁelds commute with the tangent
vector ﬁeld T , so they will be called evolution vector ﬁelds. We also denote by ¯XA(Λ) and X∗
the sets of vector ﬁelds V such that Vγ ∈ XP (γ) and Vγ ∈ X∗

P (γ), respectively. Hence,

γ and D−1

¯XA(Λ) = {V = f T + hW1 + gN + lW2 : f , h, g, l ∈ A} .

X∗

Remark 10. In what follows, we shall operate with scalar ﬁelds and vector ﬁelds in the natural way,

understanding that the result of the operation is again a scalar ﬁeld or vector ﬁeld. For instance, if
V , U are vector ﬁelds on Λ, then hV , Ui is a scalar ﬁeld, where hV , Ui (γ) = hVγ, Uγi; or ∇T V is
again a vector ﬁeld, where ∇T V (γ) = ∇Tγ Vγ and so on.

Hence, for V ∈ X∗

A(Λ), the operator DV : ¯XA(Λ) → ¯XA(Λ) is deﬁned as (DV U )(γ) = DVγ Uγ.
The operator DV can also be described in other words. Consider γ be a null curve in Λ, and suppose
that Vγ(s) = ∂γ

∂t (s, 0), then

(DV U )γ(s) =

Uγt(s).

D

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

17

In fact, the tensor derivation DV is an extension of the Fréchet derivative deﬁned in (7) for derivations
to vector ﬁelds on the null curves space. In this way, this operator can be easily translated to the
context of any other type of curves.

The Lie algebra structure on variation vector ﬁelds provided by Proposition 9 (along a particular

curve) can also be easily extended on the set X∗
Proposition 11. The map [·,·] : X∗

A(Λ) × X∗

A(Λ).

A(Λ) → X∗

A(Λ) given by

is a Lie bracket verifying the following

[V , U ](γ) = [Vγ, Uγ]γ

(a) [V , U ](f ) = V U (f ) − U V (f ) for all f ∈ A.
(b) [, ] is closed for elements in XA(Λ), i.e., if V , U ∈ XA(Λ), then [V , U ] ∈ XA(Λ).
Hence, [, ] is a Lie bracket, (X∗
(XA(Λ), [, ]) is a Lie subalgebra of X∗

A(Λ).

A(Λ), [, ]) is a Lie algebra and the space of evolution vector ﬁelds

Let us deﬁne der(A) as the set of derivations on A deﬁned in the natural way and der∗(A) the
Lie subalgebra of all evolution derivations. In this setting, the elements of der∗(A) are given by
∂(p,q), with p, q ∈ A, such that they are deﬁned as usual by ∂(p,q)f (γ) = ∂(pγ ,qγ )fγ, for all f ∈ A
and γ ∈ Λ. Each vector ﬁeld V on Λ can be regarded as a derivation on A, acting on the generators
k1 and k2 in the following way:

V (k1)(γ) = Vγ(k1γ), V (k2)(γ) = Vγ(k2γ).

Theorem 12. The map Φ : XA(Λ) → der∗(A) deﬁned by

Φ(V ) = ∂(V (k1),V (k2)) = ∂Θ(ϕV ,−ψV ),

where ϕV = ε1 h∇T V , W1i, ψV = ε2 h∇T V , W2i and Θ is deﬁned in (52), is a one-to-one homo-
morphism of Lie algebras. In particular, V1 and V2 are commuting vector ﬁelds with respect to the Lie

bracket deﬁned by Proposition 11 if and only if their corresponding curvature ﬂows (V1(k1), V1(k2))

and (V2(k1), V2(k2)) commute with respect to the usual Lie bracket for scalar ﬁelds.

Proof. Since the map Φ is clearly linear, it is enough to prove that Φ keeps the Lie bracket, i.e.,
Φ([V1, V2]) = [Φ(V1), Φ(V2)], the latter being equivalent to show that

From the last equality of Proposition 9(b) we deduce

∂([V1,V2](k1),[V1,V2](k2)) =(cid:2)∂(V1(k1),V1(k2)), ∂(V2(k1),V2(k2))(cid:3) .

(55)

[V1γ, V2γ]γ (k1γ) = V1γV2γ(k1γ) − V2γV1γ(k1γ)

= ∂(V1γ (k1γ),V1γ(k2γ ))V2γ(k1γ) − ∂(V2γ(k1γ ),V2γ(k2γ ))V1γ(k1γ),

[V1γ, V2γ]γ (k2γ) = V1γV2γ(k2γ) − V2γV1γ(k2γ)

= ∂(V1γ (k1γ),V1γ(k2γ ))V2γ(k2γ) − ∂(V2γ(k1γ ),V2γ(k2γ ))V1γ(k2γ),

18

and it is therefore satisﬁed

([V1γ, V2γ]γ(k1γ), [V1γ , V2γ]γ(k2γ)) = ∂(V1γ(k1γ ),V1γ(k2γ)) (V2γ(k1γ), V2γ(k2γ))

− ∂(V2γ(k1γ ),V2γ(k2γ )) (V1γ(k1γ), V1γ(k2γ))

= [(V1γ(k1γ), V1γ(k2γ)) , (V2γ(k1γ), V2γ(k2γ))]

for all γ ∈ Λ. Finally, formula (55) is followed from:

(cid:2)∂(V1γ(k1γ),V1γ (k2γ)), ∂(V2γ(k1γ ),V2γ(k2γ ))(cid:3) = ∂[(V1γ(k1γ ),V1γ(k2γ )),(V2γ(k1γ),V2γ(k2γ ))].

In order to prove the injectivity we shall prove that ∂(V (k1),V (k2)) = 0 implies V = 0, which is
equivalent to proving that V (k1) = V (k2) = 0 implies V = 0. As a ﬁrst step we will prove that if
V (k1) = V (k2) = 0 then ϕV = ψV = 0 and so, from formula (28), ∇T V = 0. According to (51)
we have that

(V (k1), V (k2)) = Θ(ϕV ,−ψV ) =

1
a

(θ(k1)ϕV − S(k2)ψV , S(k2)ϕV + ε1ε2θ(k1)ψV ) .

For a scalar ﬁeld f ∈ A we denote by ord(f ) the order of the highest derivative (with respect to
both k1 or k2) appearing in f , i.e.,

ord(f ) = max(i :

∂f

∂k

(i)
1

6= 0 or

∂f

∂k

(i)
2

6= 0) .

Suppose that ord(ϕV ) = n 6= 0, then we have that ord(θ(k1)ϕV ) = n + 3. Since V (k1) = 0
it is necessarily obtained that ord(S(k2)ψV ) = n + 3, whence ord(ψV ) = n + 2. Accordingly,
ord(θ(k1)ψV ) = n + 5, which together with the equation V (k2) = 0 would lead to ord(ϕV ) = n + 4
and so a contradiction. Therefore the scalar ﬁeld ϕV is constant, ϕV = c, and it would verify the
equation

0 =

1
a

(θ(k1)ϕV − S(k2)ψ) =

1

a(cid:0)ck′

1 − S(k2)ψV(cid:1) .

The latter equation is satisﬁed if and only if c = 0 and ψV = 0, i.e., ∇T V = 0. Using the formula
(25), the equation ∇T V = 0 can be developed as

f ′
V − k1hV + k2lV = 0,
afV + h′
V − ε1k1gV = 0,
ε1ahV + g′
l′
V + ε2k2gV = 0.

V = 0,

(56)

Suppose that ord(lV ) = n 6= 0, then the equations (56) give rise to the following implications

ord(gV ) = n + 1 ⇒ ord(hV ) = n + 2 ⇒ ord(fV ) = n + 3.

Nevertheless, those orders of derivation represent a direct contradiction to the ﬁrst equation in (56)
unless l = g = h = f = 0.

19

Remark 13. From Theorem 12 we have that Im(Φ) is a Lie subalgebra of the algebra der∗(A) of all
evolution derivations. Thus, we conclude that the algebra of evolution vector ﬁelds XA(Λ) on Λ can

be regarded as a Lie subalgebra of the evolution derivations.

Consider the vector ﬁelds V0 = bT and V1 = −ack1T − 2ε1a2cN borrowed from Example 8.

Observe that the evolution equation (60) is a generalization for the Hirota-Satsuma equation (1)
(through suitable constants). Besides, the ﬂows associated to the curvatures given by V0 and V1
are basically the ﬂows σ0 and σ1 given in (4). We refer to the equation (58) induced by V1 (that
also appears in [3]) as the null localized induction equation (NLIE). Theorem 12 will be used below
to obtain a recursion operator for NLIE, and thereby prove its integrability.

Proposition 14. The operator R acting on symmetries V as follows

R(V ) = X (cid:18) 1

2

V (k1),−ε1ε2V (k2)(cid:19) ,

(61)

is a recursion operator for NLIE.

Proof. Let U = R(V ). Then by deﬁnition and making use of the equation (53) we obtain

(U (k1), U (k2)) = R(2hU ,−ε1ε2lU ) = R(V (k1), V (k2)).

The result can be easily deduced as a consequence of Theorem 12.

We now proceed with the construction of an inﬁnite hierarchy of symmetries following the same

scheme as in equation (4),

Then, we have

Note that the above geometric hierarchy of commuting vector ﬁelds at the curve level is a
generalization of the ones obtained in [1] for the 3-dimensional case, albeit using a diﬀerent procedure.
In fact, it was not possible to extend the procedure used in [1] to obtain the recursion operator and
the Hamiltonian structure at the curve level to the 4-dimensional setting, mainly because of the
appearance of nonlocal vector ﬁelds. Searching for a Hamiltonian structure at the curve level for
the 4-dimensional case will be one of the subject for future research.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, our primary aim was to study the integrability properties of null curve evolutions
in a ﬂat 4-dimensional background. We undertook our research in an enough degree of generality
for the purpose of showing the role of the constants appearing on it, especially when they possess
geometrical meaning. In that regard, it is particularly important the way in which the computations
were conducted to expose the most important elements of the Hamiltonian structure for curvature
ﬂows. One of the most surprising fact was to obtain the recursion operator (split into both the
Poisson operator and the symplectic operator in formulas (51) and (52)) of the Hirota-Satsuma
system by means of the geometry of null curves or, more precisely, making use of the projection
of convenient variation vector ﬁelds onto the screen bundle. Similar results were obtain in [19, 20],
this suggesting that the screen bundle of a null curve may be thought of as playing the same role

21

of the normal bundle in a Riemannian curve. We can therefore also state the following important
conclusion: if we have a evolution vector ﬁeld V with (ϕV , ψV ) having the property of being the
gradient of a certain functional H, then the ﬂow associated to the curvatures (V (k1), V (k2)) is a
completely integrable Hamiltonian system.

Furthermore, in Proposition 14 we have lifted the recursion operator for the Hirota-Satsuma
system (at the curvature level) to a recursion operator for the NLIE equation (at the curve level),
enabling us to obtain an inﬁnite hierachy of commuting vector ﬁelds. Proposition 11 shows that the
subspace consisting of A-local evolution vector ﬁelds (denoted by XA(Λ)) is closed under bracket
and contains the commuting ﬂows as a subalgebra.

One of the many beneﬁts of increasing the dimension of the ambient space has been that the
connections between integrable hierarchies of both null curves and their curvature ﬂows become
clearer. Nevertheless, ﬁnding a Hamiltonian structure at the curve level still needs to be achieved.
In addition, it would be interesting to develop a purely geometric method to construct the existing
structures of the dynamic of null curve motions without lifting any element from the curvature
ﬂow. Accordingly, further work is needed, perhaps in a nonlocal background, if possible, to properly
understand which also has appeared in diﬀerent contexts.
