DEGENERATE NECKPINCHES IN MEAN CURVATURE

FLOW ON NONCOMPACT HYPERSURFACES

JAMES ISENBERG AND HAOTIAN WU

Abstract. We study the formation of Type-II singularities in mean
curvature ﬂows of rotationally symmetric noncompact embedded hyper-
surfaces. Using analytic techniques based on formal matched asymp-
totics and the construction of upper and lower barrier solutions en-
veloping formal solutions with prescribed behavior, we show that for
each initial hypersurface considered, a mean curvature ﬂow solution ex-
hibits the following behavior near the ﬁrst ﬁnite singular time T : (1) The
highest curvature concentrates at the tip of the hypersurface (an umbilic
point), and for each choice of the parameter γ > 1/2, there is a solution
with the highest curvature blowing up at the rate (T − t)−(γ+1/2). (2) In
a neighborhood of the tip, the solution converges to a translating soliton
which is a higher-dimensional analogue of the “Grim Reaper” solution
for the curve-shortening ﬂow. (3) Away from the tip, the ﬂow surface
approaches a collapsing cylinder at a characteristic rate dependent on
the parameter γ.

1. Introduction

Let ϕ(t) : M n → Rn+1, t0 < t < t1, be a smooth one-parameter family
of embeddings (or more generally, immersions) of n-dimensional hypersur-
faces in Rn+1. Mean curvature ﬂow (MCF) evolves the hypersurface M n
in the direction of its mean curvature vector (cid:126)H according to the following
prescription:

(1.1)

∂tϕ(p, t) = (cid:126)H,

p ∈ M n, t0 < t < t1.

MCF is a well-studied geometric evolution equation with applications in, for
example, material sciences and image processing. It is the negative gradient
ﬂow of the volume functional. MCF can be studied, as seen in Brakke’s work
[7], in the context of geometric measure theory. It can also be analyzed from
the perspective of partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs), as shown initially
by Huisken in [18].

The mean curvature ﬂow equation (1.1), if written out in terms of the
components of the evolving mapping ϕ, is a (weakly) parabolic system of

PDEs. Under this ﬂow, the curvatures of the induced metric satisfy non-
linear reaction-diﬀusion type equations. Thus, during relatively short time
intervals around the time of the initial immersion, MCF tends to smooth
out irregularities in the geometry; over a longer time scale, singularities can
form.
Indeed, ﬁnite-time singularities in MCF are known to occur for a
wide variety of families of initial data. For example, any closed convex hy-
persurface remains convex under MCF and shrinks to a “round point” in
ﬁnite time [18]. Within the realm of noncompact immersed hypersurfaces,
the mean curvature ﬂow of hypersurfaces that are initially suﬃciently close
to a cylinder are also known to become singular in ﬁnite time [16].

Singularities which form during the course of mean curvature ﬂow are
classiﬁed according to the rate of blow-up of the induced second fundamental
form of the immersed hypersurface. Speciﬁcally, if we let Mt := ϕ(t)(M n)
and denote by h(p, t) the second fundamental form of Mt at p, then if Mt
evolves by MCF and becomes singular at time t = T < ∞, this ﬁnite-time
singularity is called Type-I if

|h(p, t)|(T − t)1/2 ≤ C

sup
p∈Mt

for some C < ∞, and it is called Type-II if sup
p∈Mt
rate.

|h(p, t)| blows up at a faster

Examples of the formation of Type-I singularities under MCF are easy
to obtain: the mean curvature ﬂows of the standard spheres provide simple
examples of Type-I singularities for compact embeddings, while the MCF of
the standard cylinders provide such examples for noncompact embeddings.
Mean curvature ﬂows which develop Type-II singularities are more dif-
ﬁcult to specify. One way to do so is to consider a one-parameter family
of initial embeddings of the 2-sphere in R3, with the parameter controlling
the extent to which the equator is tightly cinched. For very loose cinching,
the ﬂow converges to the shrinking round sphere with its usual global Type
I singularity. For very tight cinching, it has been shown (see [19] and [3]
for the case of rotationally symmetric embeddings, and see [14, 15] for em-
beddings which are nearly rotationally symmetric) that the equator shrinks
more rapidly than the two “dumbbell” hemispheres, and forms a Type-I
“neckpinch”. To obtain a mean curvature ﬂow which develops a Type-II
singularity, one starts the ﬂow at the embedding with the parameter value
at the threshold between those embeddings ﬂowing to Type-I neckpinches
and those ﬂowing to Type I sphere collapses. The detailed asymptotics
of these Type-II singularities, which develop at the poles of the embedded
spheres and have been labeled “degenerate neckpinches”, have been stud-
ied (in the rotationally symmetric case) by Angenent and Vel´azquez in [2].
Rotationally symmetric compact MCF solutions which develop Type-II sin-
gularities have been constructed in [1], using the level-set ﬂows of Evans &
Spruck [10–13], and Chen, Giga & Goto [9].

In this paper, we study the formation of Type-II singularities in mean
curvature ﬂows of noncompact embedded hypersurfaces. Part of our moti-
vation for this study comes from the diﬀerences which have been observed
between the Type-II singularities which develop in Ricci ﬂow on noncom-
pact manifolds and those seen on compact manifolds. A key diﬀerence seen
in the examples studied thus far concerns the rate of curvature blowup. On
compact manifolds Σ, all the examples that have been found [4, 5] have
k−2 for integers k ≥ 3
“quantized” blowup rates of sup
x∈Σ
(here T is the time of the ﬁrst singularity). By contrast, for noncompact
manifolds Σ, the known examples [24] have a continuous spectrum of blowup
| Rm(x, t)| ∼ (T − t)−λ−1 for all λ ≥ 1. Noting that the Angenent-
rates: sup
x∈Σ
Vel´azquez examples of Type-II singularities in MCF for compact hypersur-
faces have quantized rates of blowup [2], we are led to ask what happens for
Type-II MCF singularities for noncompact hypersurfaces.

| Rm(x, t)| ∼ (T − t)

2

To motivate how we build mean curvature ﬂows of noncompact hypersur-
faces which develop Type-II singularities, we consider the following setup
(see Figure 1): Suppose we have a graph over an n-ball that asymptoti-
cally approaches the cylinder Sn × R. If we evolve both the graph and the
cylinder via MCF, then both surfaces will shrink: the cylinder shrinks to
a line in ﬁnite time, and the evolving graph will move to the right and re-
main asymptotic to the shrinking cylinder. It follows from the work of S´aez
and Schn¨urer [23] that the evolving graph disappears to spatial inﬁnity at
the same time as the cylinder collapses. Hence, near the singular time, the
left-most point on the graph must travel arbitrarily large distances in arbi-
trarily small amounts of time. Since the evolving graph moves at a speed
determined by its mean curvature, it is plausible that the curvature at the
left-most point must blow up “very fast”. Much of this scenario is conﬁrmed
in S´aez and Schn¨urer’s work. However, as noted in Open Problem 1 of [23],
the nature of the singularity at this left-most point, and the behavior of
the ﬂow in a neighborhood of the developing singularity, are not resolved in
that work. In this paper, we show that mean curvature ﬂows of this sort
develop Type-II singularities, we show that the allowed rates of decay are
not quantized in the sense described above, and we describe the asymptotic
behavior of the ﬂows near these singularities.

To construct these mean curvature ﬂows explicitly, we restrict ourselves to
the class of complete hypersurfaces that are rotationally symmetric, (strictly)
convex, smooth graphs over a ball and asymptotic to a cylinder. One readily
veriﬁes that embeddings with these properties are preserved by MCF (see
for example [23]). We now introduce the following notation. For any point
(x0, x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Rn+1, we write

(cid:113)

x = x0,

r =

1 + ··· + x2
x2
n.

Figure 1

A noncompact hypersurface Γ is said to be rotationally symmetric if

Γ = {(x0, x1, . . . , xn) : r = u(x0), a ≤ x0 < ∞} .

We assume that u is strictly concave so that the hypersurface Γ is convex
and that u is strictly increasing with u(a) = 0 and with lim
x0(cid:37)∞ u(x0) = r0,
where r0 is the radius of the cylinder. The function u is assumed to be
smooth, except at x = a. We note that this particular non-smoothness of u
is a consequence of the choice of the (cylindrical-type) coordinates; in fact,
as seen below, if the time-dependent ﬂow function u(x, t) is inverted in a
particular way, this irregularity is removed. We label the point where u = 0
the tip of the surface.

We now denote by Γt the solution to MCF which starts at a speciﬁed
choice of the initial embedding Γ (as described above). If we represent Γt
by a graph r = u(x, t), then the function u satisﬁes the PDE

(1.2)

ut =

We know from [23] that until the singularity time T , the surface Γt is asymp-
totic to the evolving cylinder; and it follows from Theorem 9.1 and Remark
9.9 (ii) in [23] that Γt races oﬀ to x → ∞ at arbitrarily large speed as the
cylinder collapses (at t → T ). To determine the details of this behavior, we
analyze solutions of equation (1.2).

To help carry out this analysis, especially in a neighborhood of the tip, it

is useful to deﬁne the following rescaled quantities

τ = − log(T − t),

y = x(T − t)γ−1/2, φ(y, τ ) = u(x, t)(T − t)−1/2,

where γ is a parameter to be speciﬁed. Substituting these quantities into
(1.2), we obtain the following PDE for φ(y, τ ):

where ∂τ|y means taking the partial derivative in τ while keeping y ﬁxed. We

readily note that equation (1.3) admits the constant solution φ ≡(cid:112)2(n − 1),

which corresponds to the collapsing cylinder (which is a soliton).

To study more general solutions, it is useful to invert the coordinates and

work with

y(φ, τ ) = y (φ(y, τ ), τ ) ;

this inversion can be done because the hypersurface under consideration is
a convex graph over a ball. In terms of y(φ, τ ), the equation corresponding
to mean curvature ﬂow (equivalent to equation (1.3) and hence equivalent
to equation (1.2)) is the following:

Our objective in this work is to construct noncompact MCF solutions that
form Type-II singularities (or “exhibit Type-II behavior”) in ﬁnite time and
obtain their precise asymptotics. Our main result is the following: (Here we
use the notation “A ∼ B” to indicate that there exist positive constants c
and C such that cB ≤ A ≤ CB.)
Theorem 1.1. For any choice of an integer n ≥ 2 and a pair of real numbers
γ > 1/2, and ˜A > 0, there exists an n-dimensional, smooth, complete non-
compact, rotationally symmetric, convex hypersurface Γ in Rn+1 for which
the MCF evolution Γt is trapped in a shrinking cylinder, escapes at spatial
inﬁnity while the cylinder becomes singular at T < ∞, and has the following
precise asymptotic properties near time T :

(1) The highest curvature occurs at the tip of the hypersurface Γt , and

(1.5)

it blows up at the precise Type-II rate

as t (cid:37) T.

(2) Near the tip, the Type-II blow-up of Γt converges to a translating
soliton which is a higher-dimensional analogue of the “Grim Reaper”

In particular, the solution constructed has the asymptotics predicted by the
formal solution described in Section 2.

Roughly speaking, the proof of this theorem (which we carry out in detail
below) proceeds as follows. Assuming the hypersurface to be a rotationally
symmetric graph (as described above), we ﬁnd that the MCF equation re-
duces to a quasilinear parabolic PDE of a scalar function. Then applying

6

matched asymptotic analysis, we formally construct approximate solutions
to the rescaled versions of this PDE. For each such approximate solution, we
construct subsolutions and supersolutions which, if carefully patched, form
barriers for the rescaled PDE. These barriers carry information of the ap-
proximate solution for times very close to the singularity time. Hence, once
we have shown (using a comparison principle) that any solution starting
from initial data between the barriers does stay between them for all time,
and once we have determined that such initial data sets do exist, we can
conclude that there are MCF solutions which exhibit the behavior found in
a region near the tip in the approximate solutions. This method of proof
based on matched asymptotic analysis has been used in a number of studies
of Type-I and Type-II singularities which develop both in Ricci ﬂow [5, 24]
and in MCF [2, 6].

We note again that while some of the general features of the behavior of
hypersurfaces of the form Γt evolving under MCF have been described in
[23], what we do here is to describe the precise asymptotic proﬁle of the
singularity and quantify the curvature blow-up rate near the singular time
for the class of complete rotationally symmetric convex graphs. In addition
to partially answering Open Problem (1) as listed in [23], our result appears
to give the ﬁrst set of examples of noncompact solutions to MCF with cur-
vature blowing up at Type-II rates. We note the striking diﬀerences of our
results from those of Angenent and Vel´azquez [2], who have constructed a
set of MCF solutions on compact hypersurfaces which develop Type-II sin-
gularities with discrete “quantized” blow up rates of the form (T − t)1/m−1
for integer m ≥ 3. These diﬀerences mirror the diﬀerences found between
Type-II singularities in Ricci ﬂow on noncompact manifolds [24] and those
on compact manifolds [4, 5].

Both MCF and Ricci ﬂow are important analytic tools with powerful
topological applications. An understanding of the ﬁnite-time singularities
of these ﬂows has been shown to be very useful in devising protocols for
surgery along the ﬂows, which in turn are crucial for using the ﬂows to study
the relationship between topological and geometric aspects of manifolds and
hypersurfaces. Perelman’s proof of the Poincar´e and Geometrization Con-
jectures [21, 22] using surgery provides the prime example of this for Ricci
ﬂow, while the analysis of two-convex hypersurfaces by Huisken and Sines-
trari [20] and the analysis of mean-convex surfaces by Brendle and Huisken
[8] provide prime examples of this for MCF (see also the work on MCF with
surgery by Haslhofer and Kleiner [17]).

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the construction of
the approximate (formal) solutions by the formal matched asymptotics. In
Section 3, we use these approximate solutions to construct the corresponding
supersolutions and subsolutions to the rescaled PDE. The supersolutions and
subsolutions are ordered and patched to create the barriers to the rescaled

PDE in Section 4; a comparison principle for the subsolutions and superso-
lutions is also proved there. In Section 5, we use these results to complete
the proof of our main theorem.

2. Matched asymptotic analysis and the construction of

formal solutions

As seen in a number of the works which study the detailed asymptotics
of the formation of degenerate neckpinches in MCF or Ricci ﬂow [2, 4, 5, 24],
a key ﬁrst step in such a study is to use matched asymptotic analysis to
produce formal approximate solutions of the ﬂow. Formal solutions of this
sort serve both as templates to which the actual solutions are shown to
approach asymptotically, and as guides for the construction of subsolutions
and supersolutions.

2.1. The formal solutions in the form y(z, τ ) or y(φ, τ ). To begin our
derivation of a class of formal approximate solutions, we assume that for
large values of τ , the terms ∂τ|φ y and
in equation (1.4) are
negligible. It follows that the PDE (1.4) can be approximated by the (linear)
ODE

for which the general solution takes the form

(2.2)

where C1 is an arbitrary constant, and φ ∈ [0,(cid:112)2(n − 1)).
then ˜y (cid:37) ∞ as φ (cid:37)(cid:112)2(n − 1). This is consistent with the surface being

If γ > 1/2,

˜y(φ) = C1

,

asymptotic to a cylinder at spatial inﬁnity. Since this is a desired feature
for the solutions of interest, we henceforth assume that γ > 1/2.

To check the consistency of the assumptions we have made in obtaining
,

the ODE (2.1), we substitute the solution ˜y into the quantity

yφφ

1 + e2γτ y2
φ

obtaining

˜yφφ

1 (1 − 2γ)2 (φeγτ )2
(2n − 2 − φ2)2γ+1 + C2

.

This suggests that ˜y is a reasonable approximate solution, provided that
φeγτ is suﬃciently large. We note that for any ﬁxed choice of  > 0, there
exists large τ such that for φ ∈ [, 2(n − 1)], this quantity is in fact large.
We label as the exterior region the (dynamic) region in which this holds.

8

JAMES ISENBERG AND HAOTIAN WU

To investigate the solution in the complementary interior region, where

φeγτ = O(1), it is useful to deﬁne a new variable

(2.3)

z = φeγτ .

We note that the condition z = O(1) is equivalent to the condition φ =
O (e−γτ ), which corresponds to a region near the tip (at which φ = 0).
Using the change-of-variables formula

∂τ|zy = ∂τ|φy − γzyz,

together with equation (1.4), we obtain the evolution equation for y(z, τ ):

To construct a formal solution to equation (2.4) in the interior region, we

follow the approach used in [2] and consider the ansatz

(2.5)

y = ˜A + e−2γτ ˜F (z, τ ),

where ˜A is a constant. Substituting this ansatz formula (2.5) into equation
(2.4), we obtain the PDE

Continuing the formal argument, we assume that for τ very large, the term

whose solution is ˜P (z) = − log cos z. The graph of x = t − log cos z,
for z ∈ (−π/2, π/2), has been labeled the “Grim Reaper”.
It translates
with constant velocity along the x-axis and is a solution to the curve-
shortening ﬂow (i.e., 1-dimensional MCF). For n ≥ 2, solving (2.8) for the
function ˜P corresponding to n dimensions and then rotating the graph of
x = c−1 ˜P (cz) + ct around the x-axis deﬁnes a higher dimensional analog of
the “Grim Reaper”. This MCF solution is a translating soliton.

The initial value problem (2.8) has been solved in [2, pp.24–25] for general
diimensions. It has a unique convex solution with the following asymptotics:



z2/2n + o(cid:0)z2(cid:1) ,

z2/(2n − 2) − log z + O(cid:0)z−2(cid:1) , z (cid:37) ∞.

z (cid:38) 0;

(2.10)

˜P (z) =

It then follows that the asymptotics for y(z, τ ) take the form

(2.11)

y(z) =



˜A + e−2γτ C(τ ) + e−2γτ (γ − 1/2) ˜A z2

2n + o(cid:0)e−2γτ z2(cid:1) ,
2(n−1) + O(cid:0)e−2γτ log z(cid:1) , z (cid:37) ∞.

z (cid:38) 0;

Recalling the scaling formulas x = y(T − t)1/2−γ and z = u(T − t)−γ−1/2,
as well as the interior region ansatz formula (2.5) and the expression (2.10)
for the asymptotics of ˜P , we obtain the following asymptotic expression for
x in a neighborhood of the tip (at z = 0):

x = y(T − t)1/2−γ = ye(γ−1/2)τ

The highest curvature occurs at the tip (as we verify below in Lemma 5.1),
so the mean curvature and hence the normal (horizontal) velocity attain
their maximal values there. Substituting in the asymptotic expression for x
obtained above, we have

If γ > 1/2 (which we presume throughout this work), then it follows from
(2.12) that the curvature blows up at Type-II rate. Moreover, over the time
period [t0, T ), the tip of the surface moves along the x-axis to the right from

Hence, we see that in terms of the x-coordinate, the surface evolving by
MCF disappears oﬀ to spatial inﬁnity as t (cid:37) T . However in terms of the
y-coordinate, so long as one chooses C(τ ) = O(τ ) (cf. Section 3.2), one ﬁnds
that the tip remains a ﬁnite distance from the origin for all time τ since

y0(τ ) = ˜A + e−2γτ C(τ ),

≈ ˜A.

The formal solutions constructed separately in the interior and the exte-
rior regions each involves a free parameter. Matching the formal solutions
on the overlap of the two regions, we can establish an algebraic relationship
between them. Using the large z asymptotic expansion formula (2.11) for
the solution y(z) in the interior region, one has (setting z equal to a constant
R, and presuming that τ is very large)

R2 + O(cid:0)e−2γτ log R(cid:1) ,

y = ˜A + e−2γτ C(τ )e−2γτ (γ − 1/2) ˜A
2(n − 1)
≈ ˜A.

(2.13)
In the exterior region, again setting z = R (and therefore φ = Re−γτ ) and
again presuming very large τ , we have

(cid:2)2(n − 1) − φ2(cid:3)1/2−γ

y = C1
≈ C1 [2(n − 1)]1/2−γ .

(2.14)

Matching (2.13) with (2.14), we obtain

˜A ≈ C1 [2(n − 1)]1/2−γ .

We now collect these results and write out expressions for our formal
solutions, both in the interior and the exterior regions. We ﬁx the constant
γ > 1/2 (one of the free parameters in the formal solution). In the interior
region, which is characterized by z = φeγτ = ue(γ+1/2)τ = O(1), we blow up
the MCF solution u(t, x) at the prescribed Type-II rate (T − t)−γ−1/2. We
also rescale the coordinates in accord with how fast the surface moves under
mean curvature ﬂow by setting y = x(T − t)γ−1/2. Then in this interior

where C(τ ) is an as-yet-unspeciﬁed function, where ˜F is related to ˜P as
speciﬁed in (2.9), and where ˜P is the solution to the initial value problem
(2.8).

In the exterior region, where Re−γτ ≤ φ < (cid:112)2(n − 1) for some R > 0

(see Lemma 3.2 for the precise deﬁnition of the exterior region), the formal

2.2. The formal solutions revisited in the form λ(z, τ ) or λ(φ, τ ). To
prove the main result (Theorem 1.1) of this paper, it is useful to work with
the quantity λ := −1/y, since in terms of λ, the asymptotically cylindrical
end of the embedded hypersurface corresponding to large values of y is eﬀec-
tively compactiﬁed. The MCF evolution equation for λ is readily obtained
by substituting the deﬁnition of λ into (1.4):

The class of MCF solutions we consider here correspond to (convex) solutions
of equation (2.15) subject to the following eﬀective boundary conditions: the
rotational symmetry of the graph implies that λφ(0, τ ) = 0, and the asymp-

totically cylindrical condition implies that λ((cid:112)2(n − 1), τ ) = 0. Working
the boundary conditions λ(−(cid:112)2(n − 1), τ ) = λ((cid:112)2(n − 1), τ ) = 0.

with the even-extension of y(φ, τ ), we ﬁnd that the MCF solutions of inter-
est also correspond to (convex) even solutions to equation (2.15) subject to

As in the analysis done above (in Section 2.1) in terms of y, it is useful
here in working with λ to use the dilated spatial variable z = φeγτ . The
evolution equation for λ(z, τ ) then takes the form

We now construct the formal solutions in terms of λ(z, τ ) or λ(φ, τ ),
using arguments very similar to those used above in constructing the formal
solutions in terms of y(z, τ ) or y(φ, τ ).

In the interior region, where we expect z = O(1), we use the ansatz

λ = −A + e−2γτ F (z),

12

JAMES ISENBERG AND HAOTIAN WU

where A is a positive constant. Substituting this ansatz into equation (2.16),
we ﬁnd that F must satisfy

Assuming, for the sake of the formal argument, that the terms in equation
(2.17) with the coeﬃcient e−2γτ in equation (2.17) can be neglected if τ is
large, we ﬁnd that (2.17) reduces to the following ODE for F :

Subject to the initial conditions P (0) = P (cid:48)(0) = 0, we can solve for P
uniquely (cf. equation (2.8)). Moreover, the asymptotic expansions of P (¯z)
are known (see [2, pp.24-25]):

3. Supersolutions and subsolutions

For a diﬀerential equation of the form G[ψ] = 0, a function ψ+ is a su-
persolution if G[ψ+] ≥ 0, while ψ− is a subsolution if G[ψ−] ≤ 0. If there
exist a supersolution ψ+ and a subsolution ψ− for the diﬀerential operator
G, and if they satisfy the inequality ψ+ ≥ ψ−, then they are called upper
and lower barriers, respectively, and it follows that there exists a solution ψ
to the equation G[ψ] = 0, with ψ+ ≥ ψ ≥ ψ−.

In this section, we construct subsolutions and supersolutions for the MCF
of our models. We do this ﬁrst separately in the interior and the exterior
regions, and then (in the next section) combine these results to obtain sub-
solutions and supersolutions for the ﬂow of a complete hypersurface.

3.1. Interior region. In the interior region, we work with λ(z, τ ), and
with the corresponding MCF equation (2.16). Hence, we work with the
quasilinear parabolic operator

for which we seek subsolutions and supersolutions. We begin the construc-
tion of these as follows.
Lemma 3.1. For an integer n ≥ 2, a real number γ > 1/2, and a pair
of real numbers A+, A− > 0, we deﬁne the function F + (or F −) to be the
solution to equation (2.18) with the constant A in that equation set to be A+
(or A−).
For any ﬁxed constants R1 > 0, B+, B−, and E+, E−, there exist func-
tions Q+, Q− : R → R, constants D+, D−, and a suﬃciently large τ1 < ∞
such that the functions

int(z, τ ) := −A± + e−2γτ F ±(z) + e−2γτ(cid:0)B±τ + E±(cid:1) + τ e−4γτ D±Q±(z)

(3.2)
λ±
int = λ±
are supersolution (+) and subsolution (−), respectively, of Tz[λ] = 0 on the
interval 0 ≤ |z| ≤ R1 for all τ ≥ τ1.
The function Q+ (or Q−) depends on A+ and F +(z) (or on A− and
F −(z)); the constant D+ (or D−) depends on n, γ, A+, B+ (or A−, B−),
and R1.
Proof. We detail the proof for 0 ≤ z ≤ R1; the proof for −R1 ≤ z ≤ 0 is
essentially identical.

It follows from the asymptotic expansion (2.20) of F that there exists

constant a C = C(R1) > 0 such that |F (z)| ≤ C and
z ∈ [0, R1]. Then using equations (2.18) and (3.3) which are satisﬁed by F
and Q, respectively, we have for 0 ≤ z ≤ R1 and τ ≥ τ1 with τ1 suﬃciently

this last inequality holds so long as we choose D so that D > (3γ−1/2+C)B;
that is, D+ > (3γ − 1/2 + C)B+.
By a similar argument, there exists D− < (3γ − 1/2 − C)B− such that
Tz[λ−] < 0 for 0 ≤ z ≤ R1 and τ ≥ τ1.
(cid:3)

The lemma is therefore proven.

τ ≥ τ4.
Proof. Based on the formulas (3.6) for λ+

ext ≤ λ+

ext and λ−

ext, we have
ext = (c− − c+)¯λ + (b+ − b−)e−2γτ ψ.

ext − λ−

Then using the expressions (3.5) for ¯λ and (3.8) for ψ, we see that if |φ| ∈

[δ,(cid:112)2(n − 1)), then ψ is uniformly bounded, and consequently

ext = (c− − c+)¯λ + O(cid:0)e−2γτ(cid:1)

ext − λ−
λ+

> 0

for all suﬃciently large τ . If |φ| ∈ [R2e−γτ , δ], then the deﬁnition (3.8) of ψ
implies that, since c− > c+,
ext − λ−
λ+

ext = (c− − c+)¯λ + O(cid:0)τ e−2γτ(cid:1)

for all suﬃciently large τ . The lemma then follows.

Recall that Lemma 3.1 holds for any R1 > 0 and Lemma 3.2 holds for
any R2 > 0. Below, we choose R2 < R1 << 1 and patch together λ+

we need the following lemma:
Lemma 4.3. For a ﬁxed integer n ≥ 2 and a ﬁxed real number γ > 1/2,
set ˜β := [2(n − 1)]3(γ−1/2) /(2γ − 1) (note that this quantity is postive), let
int and λ−

in Lemma 4.2. If we choose the constants A±, B±, b± and c± satisfying the
following relations:

A± = c±(2n − 2)γ−1/2 > 0,
B± = −2γb± ˜β,

(4.2)
and if in particular we choose b− > 0, then there exist constants R∗ and R∗
with 0 < R2 < R∗ < R∗ < R1 (cid:28) 1 such that the following inequalities hold
at z = R∗ and z = R∗ for all τ ≥ τ5 := max{τ3, τ4}:

(4.4)

Carrying out an even extension (in z) for these quantities, we ﬁnd that
corresponding inequalities hold at z = −R∗ and z = −R∗ for all τ ≥ τ5.

Proof. We detail the proof for z, φ ∈ (0, 2(cid:112)(n − 1)); the proof for z, φ ∈
(−2(cid:112)(n − 1), 0) is identical.

We ﬁrst prove the inequalities in (4.3).

where ˜β (deﬁned above as [2(n − 1)]3(γ−1/2) /(2γ − 1)) and d are constants
which depend only on n and γ. We thus have

B+ = −2γb+ ˜β.

Thus, there exist R3 > 0 and K > 1 such that R2 < R3 < KR3 < R1 << 1
and such that the following inequalities hold for all τ ≥ τ5:

e2γτ (λ+

If we now set R∗ := min{R3, R4} and R∗ := max{KR3, LR4}, the proof
(cid:3)
of this lemma is complete.
Remark 4.4. The choices of A± and of c± in Lemma 4.3 guarantee that
Lemmata 4.1 and 4.2 both hold.

We now patch the regional sub and super solutions, thereby producing
global sub and super solutions, which are consequently upper and lower

barriers: For |φ| ∈ [0,(cid:112)2(n − 1)) and for τ ≥ τ5, we deﬁne λ+ := λ+(φ, τ )

by

(4.9)

λ+ :=

The properties of the barriers λ± are summarized in the following Propo-

sition.
Proposition 4.5. For a ﬁxed integer n ≥ 2 and a ﬁxed real number γ >
1/2, let λ+ and λ− be deﬁned as in (4.9) and (4.10), respectively. There
exists a suﬃciently large (but ﬁnite) τ0 such that the following hold true for

−(cid:112)2(n − 1) < φ <(cid:112)2(n − 1) and for τ ≥ τ0:
(B2) λ− < λ+ for (φ, τ ) ∈ (−(cid:112)2(n − 1),(cid:112)2(n − 1)) × (τ0,∞).

resp., for −(cid:112)2(n − 1) < φ <(cid:112)2(n − 1) and τ ≥ τ0.

Condition (B3) follows from the deﬁnition of λ±. Condition (B4) follows

We now prove a comparison principle for any pair of smooth functions
such that one of them is a subsolution of equation Fφ[λ] = 0 (cf. (2.15)) and

24

JAMES ISENBERG AND HAOTIAN WU

the other is a smooth supersolution of the same equation (they need not be
related to the subsolution λ− or supersolution λ+ constructed above).
Proposition 4.6. (Comparison principle for Fφ[λ] = 0) For a ﬁxed integer
n ≥ 2, a ﬁxed real number γ > 1/2, and some ¯τ ∈ (τ0,∞), suppose that ζ +,
ζ− are any smooth non-positive super- and sub- solutions (not necessarily
those constructed in Proposition 4.5) of the equation Fφ[λ] = 0, respectively.
Assume that

(C1) ζ−(φ, τ0) < ζ +(φ, τ0) for φ ∈ (−(cid:112)2(n − 1),(cid:112)2(n − 1)),
(C2) ζ−(−(cid:112)2(n − 1), τ ) ≤ ζ +(−(cid:112)2(n − 1), τ ) for τ ∈ [τ0, ¯τ ],
(C3) ζ−((cid:112)2(n − 1), τ ) ≤ ζ +((cid:112)2(n − 1), τ ) for τ ∈ [τ0, ¯τ ],
Then ζ−(φ, τ0) ≤ ζ +(φ, τ0) for (φ, τ ) ∈ [−(cid:112)2(n − 1),(cid:112)2(n − 1)]× [τ0, ¯τ ].
We claim that v ≥ 0 on (φ, τ ) ∈ [−(cid:112)2(n − 1),(cid:112)2(n − 1)] × [τ0, ¯τ ]. To

which is a contradiction. Hence, the claim is true. Since  > 0 is arbitrary,
(cid:3)
the proposition follows.

Remark 4.7. Despite the fact that the piecewise smooth upper barrier λ+
and the piecewise smooth lower barrier λ− deﬁned by (4.9) and (4.10), re-
spectively, are not smooth, the comparison principle (Proposition 4.6) ap-
plies to them. This is because, by construction, the non-smooth corners of
λ+ are convex and the non-smooth corners of λ− are concave. Hence, the
points of ﬁrst contact of either λ+ or λ− with a given smooth MCF solution
λ are necessarily away from the corners; they occur at smooth points of λ+
or λ−.

We end this section by discussing the relation between the barriers λ+
and λ− and a formal solution λf orm. Suppose that c ∈ (c+, c−), and let
A = c(2n − 2)γ−1/2. It then follows from equations (4.5) and (4.7) that we
have A ∈ (A+, A−). Now consider the following formal solutions deﬁned in
the interior and exterior regions, respectively, for all τ ≥ τ5:

λf orm,int(z, τ ) = −A + e−2γτ F (z),
λf orm,ext(φ, τ ) = −c(2n − 2 − φ2)γ−1/2,

|z| ∈ [0, R∗];

|φ| ∈ [R∗e−γτ ,(cid:112)2(n − 1)).

We see that (cf. the proof of Lemmata 4.1 and 4.2) for all τ ≥ τ5,

λ−
int < λf orm,int < λ+

λ−
ext < λf orm,ext < λ+

|z| ∈ [0, R∗];

|φ| ∈ [R∗e−γτ ,(cid:112)2(n − 1)).

5. Proof of the main theorem

We ﬁrst show that the highest curvature for a convex rotationally sym-

metric solution of MCF is always achieved at the tip.2
Lemma 5.1. For a convex rotationally symmetric solution Γt, t ∈ (0, T ),
|h(p, t)| (and hence
of mean curvature ﬂow, the maximum curvature sup
p∈Mt

H(p, t)) occurs at the tip of the surface Γt for each t ∈ (0, T )

sup
p∈Mt

Proof. This fact is a consequence of the convexity of the graph, which is pre-
served under MCF. The principal curvatures of the rotationally symmetric
graph are

κ1 = ··· = κn−1 =

u(1 + u2

x)1/2

κn = −

,

uxx
(1 + u2

From these formulas, we see that if we deﬁne the quantity R := κn

R = − uuxx
(1 + u2
x)

= (1 − n) − uut,

2The proof of the lemma is contained in [6, Lemma 3.1]. We include it here for

completeness.

26

JAMES ISENBERG AND HAOTIAN WU

where the last equality follows from the MCF equation (1.2). Note that
R ≥ 0 because uxx(·, t) ≤ 0 as a consequence of the presumed convexity of
the graph. One computes that

(cid:2)(1 − R2) − (n − 2)(1 − R)(cid:3) .

For t ∈ (0, T ), R = 1 at the tip since the tip is an umbilic point, and
lim
x(cid:37)∞ R = 0 since the surface is asympotic to a shrinking cylinder. At a
maximum of R (which occurs at an interior point), Rx = 0, Rxx ≤ 0; hence

It then follows from the maximum principle that R ≤ 1. Note that R ≤ 1 is

For i = 1, . . . , n − 1, we have κ−1
x = ux(1 + u2

x)1/2, which implies that

x + uuxx ≥ 0.
i = u(1 + u2
x)−1/2(1 + u2

since ux ≥ 0 for x ≥ x0(t) (the position of the moving tip). So κi has its
maximum at the tip. Since R = 1 at the tip and R ≤ 1 everywhere, all
|h(p, t)| =
the principal curvatures are maximal at the tip. Therefore, sup

We now prove the main theorem of the paper.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let n ≥ 2 and γ > 1/2. Let τ0 ≥ τ5, where τ5 is
given in Lemma 4.3.
We ﬁrst construct initial data for MCF ﬂow by patching formal solutions
in the interior and exterior regions at τ = τ0. Pick c ∈ (c+, c−), and let
A = c(2n−2)γ−1/2. It follows that A ∈ (A+, A−). Recalling that z = φe−γτ ,
we deﬁne

so then at τ = τ0 and for all |φ| ∈ [0,(cid:112)2(n − 1)), we have

−c(2n − 2 − φ2)γ−1/2,

λ−(φ, τ0) < ˆλ0(φ) < λ+(φ, τ0).

where we recall that R∗ is deﬁned in Lemma 4.3. In particular, by taking
τ0 suﬃciently large, we can ensure

0 ≤ |z| ≤ R∗,

It follows from its construction that ˆλ0 is continuous and piecewise smooth,
ˆλ0 = 0. Moreover, ˆλ is convex since F (z) and −c(2n−
and that
2−φ2)γ−1/2 are convex. Consequently we can smooth ˆλ0 to obtain a smooth

convex function λ0 such that λ− < λ0 < λ+ for |φ| ∈ [0,(cid:112)2(n − 1)) at

2(n−1)

τ = τ0, and such that

λ0 = 0. Then the function λ0 corresponds

to a smooth, complete, rotationally symmetric, convex, asymptotically cylin-
drical hypersurface over a ball.

MCF starting from such a hypersurface must have a smooth solution up to
some ﬁrst singular time T . Let λ(φ, τ ) correspond to such a MCF solution.

Since λ− < λ < λ+ on (−(cid:112)2(n − 1),(cid:112)2(n − 1)) at τ = τ0, the compari-

Remark 5.2. For the class of MCF solutions we consider, the asymptotic
cylindrical condition is given by a precise rate and this rate is preserved
under MCF.

To study the behavior of such a MCF solution near the tip as τ (cid:37) ∞, we
work with y(z, τ ) instead of λ(z, τ ). Recall that y(z, τ ) evolves by equation
(2.4). Let ˜A = −1/A. Deﬁne ˜p(z, τ ) by the relation
y(φ, τ ) = ˜A + e−2γτ ˜p(z, τ ).
(5.1)
Then ˜p(z, τ ) satisﬁes the PDE B[˜p] = 0 where

Part (2) of Theorem 1.1 is a consequence of the following lemma:
Lemma 5.3 (Type-II blow-up). Recall the function ˜P deﬁned in (2.8) which
forms part of a formal solution to MCF. We have the following asymptotic
behavior of ˜p:

Proof of Lemma 5.3. We show that ˜p(z, τ ) converges uniformly to ˜P
as τ → ∞ for bounded z ≥ 0. To do this, it is useful to deﬁne a new “time”
variable s = e2γτ /(2γ). In terms s, ˜p satisﬁes the PDE

We note that equations (5.4) and (5.5) are the same as equations (7.13) and
(7.14) in [2]. Indeed, we see that the coeﬃcient 2γ+1

Lemma 5.3 implies that a smooth convex MCF solution expressed in
y(z, τ ) satisﬁes the following asymptotics: on a compact z interval (in the
interior region), as τ (cid:37) ∞,

y(z, τ ) = ˜A − e−γτ ˜p(0, τ ) + e−2γτ

The highest curvature of this MCF solution occurs at the tip where z = 0
(cf. Lemma 5.1) and necessarily blows up at the rate predicted by the formal
solution e−2γτ
in the (x, t)-coordinates (cf. (2.12)), proves part (1) of Theorem 1.1.

(cf. Section 2), which, after being translated back

˜P ((γ−1/2) ˜Az)

(γ−1/2) ˜A

(cid:3)

Therefore, Theorem 1.1 is proved.
