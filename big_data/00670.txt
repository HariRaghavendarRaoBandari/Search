Trophic coherence, a measure of the extent to which the nodes of a directed network are organised in levels,
has recently been shown to be closely related to many structural and dynamical aspects of complex systems,
including graph eigenspectra, the prevalence or absence of feed-back cycles, and linear stability. Furthermore,
non-trivial trophic structures have been observed in networks of neurons, species, genes, metabolites, cellular
signalling, concatenated words, P2P users, and world trade. Here we consider two simple yet apparently quite
diﬀerent dynamical models – one a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model adapted to include
complex contagion, the other an Amari-Hopﬁeld neural network – and show that in both cases the related
spreading processes are modulated in similar ways by the trophic coherence of the underlying networks. To
do this, we propose a network assembly model which can generate structures with tunable trophic coherence,
limiting in either perfectly stratiﬁed networks or random graphs. We ﬁnd that trophic coherence can exert
a qualitative change in spreading behaviour, determining whether a pulse of activity will percolate through
the entire network or remain conﬁned to a subset of nodes, and whether such activity will quickly die out or
endure indeﬁnitely. These results could be important for our understanding of phenomena such as epidemics,
rumours, shocks to ecosystems, neuronal avalanches, and many other spreading processes.

A great many processes involve some kind of ac-
tivity travelling through a complex system: a ru-
mour or contagious disease in society, waves of
action potentials between neurons, cascades of
defaults in a banking system, or species under
stress in an ecosystem, for instance.
It is well-
known that food webs – or networks of predation
– have a trophic structure, a hierarchy of plants,
herbivores, omnivores, primary carnivores, and
so on up to top predators, deﬁned by how many
steps separate each species from the source of en-
ergy.
It has recently been shown that “trophic
coherence”, a measure of how neatly these nodes
fall
is key to understand-
ing many structural and dynamical features not
just of food webs, but of a range of biological
and artiﬁcial networks. In light of these observa-
tions, we now study how trophic coherence aﬀects
spreading processes, and ﬁnd that it plays an im-
portant role. Our results suggest, for example,
that whether a contagious disease will become en-
demic, or whether a sensory stimulus will propa-
gate through a brain, could be determined by the
trophic coherence of the underlying networks.

INTRODUCTION

An activist tweets a picture and the image spreads
through social networks, perhaps going viral; informa-
tion enters the brain via sensory neurons and cascades
through various kinds of cell before inducing motor neu-
rons to ﬁre; the plants in an ecosystem are decimated by a
drought and the pulse of want travels up through trophic
chains until even the top predators are aﬀected. These
and many others are examples of spreading processes in
complex systems which can be regarded as cascades of ac-
tivity percolating through directed networks. Crucially,
the signals arriving at a node – person, neuron, species
– can combine to create a nonlinear response:
it is not
the same to receive a trickle of signals over an extended
period of time as a single, large package.

Over the past decade and a half much work has gone
into studying the eﬀect of network topology on dynami-
cal processes of various kinds.1–3 One of the ﬁrst widely
acknowledged consequences of the small-world property
famously described by Watts and Strogatz4 was that epi-
demics could spread rapidly through social networks be-
cause of just a few long-range connections.5 Subsequent
work on epidemic models has revealed a rich relation-
ship between network structure and spreading.6–10 For
instance, the phenomenon of ‘complex contagion’, which
Centola showed experimentally to play a part in online
social networks,11 has recently been investigated mathe-
matically on clustered network models.12 Network struc-
ture is also important in models of opinion formation,13,14
and in this context the ‘q-voter model’ captures the idea
of complex contagion.15,16 Activity on neural networks,

Figure 1. Left: An example of a maximally coherent network (q = 0). Right: A network with the same parameters N , B and
L as the one on the left, but less trophically coherent (q = 0.49). In both cases, the hight of the nodes on the vertical axis
represents their trophic level. The networks were generated with the preferential preying model as described in the main text,
with T = 0.001 for the one on the left, and T = 1 for the one on the right.

while not usually studied as spreading processes, has also
been shown, in simple models, to depend fundamentally
on topological properties, such as degree heterogeneity,17
assortativity,18 and clustering.19 Furthermore, much re-
search has focused on mapping the structure of biological
neural networks, and understanding how such topologies
arise.20–25

‘Trophic coherence’, a measure of how neatly food webs
or other directed networks fall into well-deﬁned trophic
levels, has recently been shown to play a key role in
the dynamical stability of ecosystems.26 Such is the in-
ﬂuence of this topological property that suﬃciently co-
herent networks can become more stable with increas-
ing size and complexity, thereby oﬀering a solution to
May’s paradox.26–29 It has also been suggested that the
trophic coherence of ecosystems may have contributed
to the devastating eﬀect that human expansion had on
Pleistocene megafauna.30 But it is not only food webs
which exhibit a signiﬁcantly non-random trophic struc-
ture: this characteristic has recently been shown to de-
termine properties such as eigenspectra,31 feedback,31,32
directionality,32 and intervality33 in a wide variety of bi-
ological and artiﬁcial networks, including those of gene
transcription, neurons, metabolites, cellular signalling,
concatenated words, P2P users and world trade.31,32

In this paper we show that trophic coherence also af-
fects spreading processes. We consider two seemingly
rather diﬀerent models, one a version of the Susceptible-
Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model10 extended to
account for complex contagion,11,15 and the other an
Amari-Hopﬁeld neural network.34–36

To generate directed networks with tunable trophic co-
herence we propose a variation of the ‘preferential prey-
ing’ model (PPM) used by Johnson et al.26, with the
diﬀerence that this version limits in random graphs in-
stead of acyclic ‘cascade model’ networks, and is therefore
less speciﬁc to food webs and perhaps more appropriate
for investigating generic directed networks. Our numer-
ical study reveals that trophic coherence can determine
whether a pulse of activity in either model will propagate
through the entire network or remain conﬁned to a small

fraction of nodes, or become endemic as opposed to dying
out soon after initiation. We conclude with some open
questions and our assessment of the main areas where
theoretical research might provide important insights.

II. METHODS

A. Trophic coherence

Let us consider a directed network given by the N × N
adjacency matrix A, with elements aij = 1 if there is
a directed edge from node j to node i, and aij = 0 if
not. The in- and out-degrees of node i are kin
and kout

i = Pj aij
i = Pj aji, respectively. The number of edges is
L = Pij aij, and the mean degree is hki = L/N . We

shall assume that the network is weakly connected, and
that there is a number B > 0 of nodes with kin = 0,
which we shall refer to as basal nodes. It is standard in
ecology to deﬁne the trophic level si of nodes as

si = 1 +

1
kin

i Xj

aij sj,

(1)

i = 0.

i > 0, or si = 1 if kin

if kin
In other words, the
trophic level of basal nodes (autotrophs in the ecologi-
cal context) is s = 1 by convention, while other nodes
(consumer species) are assigned the mean trophic level
of their in-neighbours (resources), plus one.37 Thus, for
any directed network in which every node is on at least
one directed path originating at a basal node, the trophic
level of each node is a topological feature easily obtained
by solving the linear system of Eq. (1). In a recent pa-
per, Johnson et al.26 characterise each edge in an network
with a trophic distance: xij = si − sj (not a distance in
the mathematical sense since it can take negative val-
ues). They then consider the distribution of trophic dis-
tances over the network, p(x), which will always have
mean hxi = 1. The homogeneity of p(x) is called trophic
coherence: the more similar the trophic distances of all
the edges, the more coherent the network. As a measure

of coherence, one can simply use the standard deviation
of p(x), which is referred to as an incoherence parameter:

q = phx2i − 1.

When applied to food webs – networks of who eats
whom in an ecosystem – it turns out that trophic coher-
ence is the best statistical predictor of linear stability.26
Furthermore, a simple model which generates networks
with tunable coherence shows that this property can al-
low for systems to become more stable with size and edge
density – which suggests a solution to May’s paradox, or
why large, complex ecosystems are observed to be the
most stable.26–29 By deﬁning the coherence ensemble, it
has recently been shown31 that trophic coherence is a key
factor determining the cycle structure and distribution of
eigenvalues in directed networks, and that it is possible
to compare the empirical value of q for a given network

to its random expectation, ˜q = pL/LB − 1, where LB is

the number of edges connected to basal nodes. It turns
out that certain kinds of biological network, such as food
webs, some gene regulatory networks, or the C. elegans
neural network, are signiﬁcantly coherent (q < ˜q); while
others, most notably metabolic networks, are less coher-
ent than the random expectation (q > ˜q).31

Figure 1 displays two small networks which diﬀer only
in their trophic coherence: the one on the left is maxi-
mally coherent (q = 0), while the one on the right is more
incoherent (q = 0.49). Even the one on the right, how-
ever, is more coherent than the corresponding random
expectation (˜q = 2.24). Note that the diﬀerence between
the two networks is apparent thanks to the nodes be-
ing plotted on a vertical axis representing trophic level
– when this information is not highlighted in the visu-
alisation, signiﬁcantly coherent networks can appear no
diﬀerent from incoherent ones to the naked eye. From
the network on the left, it is clear that a maximally co-
herent network is also mutlipartite (or bipartite in the
case of having only two trophic levels). Thus, trophic co-
herence can be regarded as the extent to which a network
approaches this state of order, much as modularity is a
measure of how close an undirected network is to being
disconnex.38

It is not yet known what mechanisms lead to trophic
coherence – or incoherence – in directed networks. One
possibility is that edges are formed preferentially between
nodes with speciﬁc functions, which in turn are corre-
lated with trophic level. For instance, in an ecosystem
the biomass is produced by the plants and ﬂows up the
food chain through herbivores, primary carnivores, and
secondary carnivores until it reaches the apex predators.
Likewise, information enters a neural network via sensory
neurons, and is passed on to interneurons and other cells
with various processing functions before reaching the mo-
tor neurons. On the other hand, since trophic coherence
is related to several other structural and dynamical prop-
erties, it may be that in certain systems topologies are
selected for their stability, robustness or feedback charac-
teristics, and coherence is a secondary eﬀect. Be this as
it may, the networks observed to exhibit this feature tend

to be involved in the transport of some quantity – such as
energy or information – through a system. In this paper
we therefore explore the eﬀects of trophic coherence on
spreading processes, and ﬁnd that it plays an important
role, in some circumstances inducing transitions between
qualitatively diﬀerent regimes of dynamical behaviour.

1. Generating coherent networks

Johnson et al.26 put forward a model for generating net-
works with a tunable degree of trophic coherence, re-
ferred to as the ‘preferential preying model’ (PPM). How-
ever, the networks thus generated are always acyclic.
While this is a characteristic of many food webs, we are
here interested in studying the eﬀects of trophic coher-
ence on spreading processes in the most general circum-
stances possible, and so propose an extension of the PPM
which can generate cycles. In the ﬁrst step of the model,
we begin with B basal nodes and proceed to introduce
N − B non-basal nodes sequentially; each of these has, at
this stage, only one in-neighbour, chosen randomly from
among the extant nodes (basal and non-basal) already
in the network when it arrives. At the end of this step,
each node i has a preliminary trophic level, ˜si, as given
by Eq. (1) (in every case an integer, since each non-basal
node has so far only one in-neighbour). The second step
is to introduce the remaining L − N + B edges needed
to make up a total of L. For this, each pair of nodes i, j
such that i is a non-basal node is attributed a tentative
trophic distance ˜xij = ˜si − ˜si. Edges between pairs are
then placed with a probability proportional to

P (aij → 1) ∝ exp(cid:20)−

(˜xij − 1)2

2T 2

(cid:21) ,

(2)

until there are L edges in the network. As in the original
PPM, the ‘temperature’ parameter T tunes the degree
of trophic coherence, with T = 0 yielding maximally
coherent networks (q = 0), and incoherence increasing
monotonically with T . The speciﬁc choice for the edge
probability is arbitrary, but the form in Eq. (2) is con-
ducive to a Gaussian distribution of distances x, which
we have found to be a good ﬁt to empirical data on sev-
eral kinds of networks. The relationship between T and
q in networks thus generated is shown in Fig. 2. At low
T we observe that q ≃ T , while the coherence saturates
to the randomly expected value at higher T .

The main diﬀerence between the model described
above and the original PPM as implemented by John-
son et al.26 – and also by Dom´ınguez-Garc´ıa et al.
in
this same issue33 – is in the networks generated at high
T . Both models generate maximally coherent networks
when T → 0. However, when T → ∞, the original ver-
sion coincides with both the ‘generalised cascade model’,
and with the ‘generalised niche model’ when its param-
eter c = 0, a limiting behaviour which makes for useful
comparisons in the context of food webs.39,40 The ver-
sion of the PPM which we now put forward generates
networks which approach directed Erd¨os-R´enyi random
graphs at high temperature. In fact, at T → ∞, the net-
works generated are the overlap of two graphs: a “skele-
ton” with N − B edges, which ensures that the network
is weakly connected; and a directed random graph with
L − N + B edges, and the constraint that B nodes have
kin = 0.

B. Spreading processes

The spreading of some form of activity through a system
has been extensively studied in a wide variety of set-
tings, most notably in percolation theory.41,42 Examples
include epidemics,10 opinions,15 forest-ﬁres,43 trophic
cascades,44 and avalanches of neural activity.45 With a
view to exploring the inﬂuence of trophic coherence on
how activity of some kind spreads through a system, we
consider two diﬀerent paradigms: a model of complex
contagion, and an Amari-Hopﬁeld neural-network model.

1. Complex contagion

Our ﬁrst model
is an adaptation of the standard
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model,10
in which each node i in a network is characterised at time
t by a binary variable zi(t), which can be in either of two
states: ‘susceptible’ (zi(t) = S) or ‘infected’ (zi(t) = I).
Our version of this model will take into account the phe-
nomenon of “complex contagion”, whereby the probabil-
ity of an element becoming ‘infected’ can be a non-linear
function of the proportion of its neighbours who are al-
ready ‘infected’. Centola has shown that social reinforce-
ment plays a key role in the adoption of behaviour by

4

participants in an online experiment,11 and theoretical
research has recently highlighted how network clustering
can inﬂuence this kind of spreading process.12 We con-
sider that, at each time step t, each ‘susceptible’ node i
has a probability of becoming ‘infected’ given by

P [zi(t + 1) = I|zi(t) = S] = fi(t)α,

(3)

where f (t) is the fraction of i’s in-neighbours (i.e. of
those nodes j such that aij = 1) which are in the ‘in-
fected’ state at time t (zj(t) = I), and α is a parameter
which determines the kind of complex contagion. A node
which is ‘infected’ at time t automatically becomes ‘sus-
ceptible’ again at time t + 1:

P [zi(t + 1) = S|zi(t) = I] = 1,

(4)

and all nodes are updated in parallel.

The essence of complex contagion is captured also by
the ‘q-voter model’ of opinion dynamics,15 a generaliza-
tion of the well-known voter model13 in which the prob-
ability of an agent updating its state depends on there
being a consensus among q of its neighbours.

2. Neural networks

The second model we consider is an Amari-Hopﬁeld neu-
ral network, in which nodes are binary variables with
states vi(t) = ±1 representing the fact that, in a given
time window, a neuron can either ﬁre an action potential,
or not.34–36 Nodes are updated in parallel according to
the probability

P [vi(t + 1) = ±1] =

1
2

{± tanh [βhi(t)] + 1} ,

(5)

where the ﬁeld at i is

hi(t) = Xj

aijvj(t),

(6)

and the parameter β sets the degree of stochasticity.
(Note that the expression for hi(t) usually takes into ac-
count the eﬀects of “synaptic weights” which can by used
to store information in the network, but for this work we
are considering all the weights to be equal.)

Although real neurons exhibit far richer behaviour
than this simple model would suggest, for many purposes
collections of binary neurons are found to yield results
qualitatively similar to those of more realistic models.46

III. RESULTS

In order to investigate numerically the eﬀects of trophic
coherence on spreading processes, we generate networks
with given number of nodes N , basal nodes B, and edges
L as speciﬁed above, and carry out Monte Carlo runs
of each of our dynamical models for diﬀerent values of

the parameter T – i.e.
for diﬀerent degrees of trophic
coherence. For the complex contagion model, the initial
condition is to set all nodes to ‘susceptible’ except for the
basal nodes, which are all ‘infected’; that is, zi(t = 0) = S
if kin > 0, and zi(t = 0) = I if kin = 0. For each run
we measure the Duration of the infection, that is, the
number of time steps until no nodes are ‘infected’; as
well as the Incidence, or proportion of nodes which have
at any time been in the ‘infected’ state.

Figure 3(a) shows the mean Incidence against T for
various values of α. In highly coherent networks (T ≃ 0)
the infection spreads to the whole network for any α,
while on less coherent topologies the eﬀect of this pa-
rameter becomes apparent. In Fig. 3(b), where the mean
Incidence is plotted against α for diﬀerent values of T ,
we see that the infection can spread to a large fraction
of the network if α < 1, whereas it dies out after only
infecting a small number of ‘susceptible’ nodes if α > 1.
Hence, it is the interplay of both the trophic coherence
of the underlying network, and the form of the infection
probability, which determines whether the infection can
spread. It is noteworthy that the Incidence shows a non-

monotonic dependence on trophic coherence when α < 1
(sub-linear contagion).

We also perform a similar investigation of the Amari-
Hopﬁeld neural model on networks generated in the same
way. Now we set all the basal nodes initially to ‘ﬁring’
(i.e. vi(t = 0) = 1 if kin
i = 0), and all other nodes to
‘not ﬁring’ (vi(t = 0) = −1 if kin
i > 0). The Duration
is now the number of time steps to ensue before all the
nodes are in the ‘not ﬁring’ state, and the Incidence is
the proportion of nodes which at any moment during this
period adopted the ‘ﬁring’ state. As with the infection,
whether this pulse will propagate throughout the whole
network is determined by both the neural dynamics, as
parametrised by β; and the trophic coherence of the net-
work. Figure 3(c) shows the mean Incidence against T
for several values of β, while Fig. 3(c) has β on the x-axis
for various values of T . Despite the diﬀerent dynamics,
the curves bear a resemblance to the cases in panels (a)
and (b). In both cases, a high trophic coherence (T ≃ 0)
can ensure that the pulse of activity will reach most of
the network irrespectively of other parameters, whereas
if the network is incoherent (T ≫ 0) propagation requires

neural network).

Figure 4 displays heat-maps for the complex contagion
case [panels (a) and (b)] and the neural network model
[panels (c) and (d)]. Panels (a) and (c) show the mean
Incidence against T and the relevant model parameter
(α for the complex contagion and β for the neural net-
work), while panels (b) and (d) show the logarithm of
the Duration against the same parameters. We run the
simulations for a maximum of 103 Monte Carlo steps, so
Duration above this can mean either a long but eventu-
ally ﬁnite (transient) period of activation, or an endemic
state in which a degree of activity remains indeﬁnitely.
On highly incoherent networks (T → ∞) both models
can exhibit either of two behaviours, depending on their
parameters: for suﬃciently high α or β, the activity ini-
tiated at the basal nodes dies out after a relatively short
transient period; while at lower values the activity be-
comes endemic, or at least long-lived. In both cases, the
critical values at which this transition occurs are medi-
ated by the trophic coherence of the network.
In the
complex contagion case, the critical value of alpha drops
with decreasing T , so that the more coherent the net-
work the more sub-linear must the contagion be to be-

come endemic. In the neural network model, on the other
hand, trophic coherence has a non-monotonic eﬀect on
the spreading of activity: as T decreases, the region of
β in which the activation of the basal nodes cascades to
the whole network increases to a peak value; for lower
T , behaviour depends strongly on β. In this “coherence
range” T . 1, the high stochasticity of the model at low
β ensures continual activation of some nodes, while for β
above a critical value the activity spreads to most of the
nodes (Incidence ≃ 1) but then dies out (low Duration).

IV. DISCUSSION

We have shown that the trophic coherence of directed
networks can have an important eﬀect on spreading pro-
cesses taking place thereon. We have not yet delved into
the details of how trophic structure aﬀects such processes,
but our numerical investigation of two seemingly quite
diﬀerent dynamics – one a model inspired by epidemics,
the other a neural-network model originally put forward
to explain associative memory – suggests that trophic
structure is a key topological feature which should be
taken into account when studying any system in which

some kind of signal is transmitted between its elements in
such as way that these signals interact. In both dynam-
ical models explored, we have found that trophic coher-
ence can alter behaviour qualitatively, in some cases de-
termining whether a pulse of activity will be transmitted
to the whole system or just to a small portion, or whether
activation will die out after a few time steps or become
endemic. Trophic coherence has already been shown to
play an important role in determining various features of
directed networks, such as linear stability,26 feed-back,31
and intervality.33 We add here to such work by showing
that spreading processes are also strongly inﬂuenced by
this recently identiﬁed topological feature, and submit
that more research is required to determine its relation-
ship to other network properties, to build a generalised
understanding of its bearing on dynamical processes, and
to discover by what mechanisms non-trivial coherence or
incoherence comes about in nature.
