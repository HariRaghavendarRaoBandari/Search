Teleportation stretching for single-mode Gaussian channels

If a quantum channel is commutable with a certain set of operators, a Choi state of the channel
becomes a suﬃcient resource for any entanglement generation achieved by a single use of the channel
with the help of local operation and classical communications (LOCC). This property, called the
teleportation stretchable, could be useful to determine an upper bound of a fundamental rate-
loss trade-oﬀ for optical quantum key distribution. Unfortunately, the known formulation of the
teleportation-stretching expansion for lossy Gaussian channels is based on an additional assumption
of the Choi state with inﬁnite energy. In this paper, we present an entanglement-assisted LOCC
protocol with a bounded energy entangled state, and identify a resource state being suﬃcient for a
general entanglement generation protocol through a single use of lossy Gaussian channels. We also
extend this protocol for the cases of general single-mode Gaussian channels. Our results provide a
regular path to determine an ultimate limit of quantum communication.

INTRODUCTION

Eη acting on an inﬁnite dimensional system as

Lossy Gaussian channels play a signiﬁcant role to de-
scribe the optical loss and mode mismatches in optical
transmission of light ﬁelds. Quantifying communication
capacities for such channels is a central topic of quan-
tum information science [1–3]. There are many insight-
ful interplay between entanglement and channel capac-
ities in quantum communication under the local opera-
tion and classical communication (LOCC) paradigm [4].
An essential question is what is an ultimate limit of
sharable entanglement per channel use under arbitrary
use of LOCC. Takeoka, Guha, and Wilde introduced the
squashed entanglement as an upper bound on the quan-
tum communication capacity of a quantum channel as-
sisted by unlimited forward and backward classical com-
munication, and established a limit of the fundamental
rate-loss trade-oﬀ in quantum key distribution due to a
pure lossy channel [5, 6]. Further, a general upper bound
of the rate-loss trade-oﬀ on the point-to-point communi-
cation assisted with intermediate stations has been for-
mulated in Ref. [7]. Interestingly, there are observations
that the bound is not so far from practically achievable
rates [8, 9].

In a recent arXiv paper [10] by Pirandola, Laurenza,
Ottaviani, and Banchi (PLOB), it is claimed that the
tight rate-loss trade-oﬀ over a pure lossy channel with
transmission η is given by

− log2(1 − η).

(1)

In order to prove that this is an upper bound, they intro-
duced a method called the teleportation stretching that
essentially implies any entanglement generation through
a single use of the channel can be accomplished by an
LOCC protocol starting with the Choi state of the chan-
nel provided the channel fulﬁlls certain conditions [11]. In
the case of a ﬁnite dimensional systems, the Choi state of
a quantum channel E is normally deﬁned as I ⊗E(ΦMES)
with a maximally entangled state ΦMES. As an analogy,
PLOB deﬁned a Choi matrix of the pure lossy channel

ρE := I ⊗ Eη(ΦEPR),

(2)

where they assumed an ideal Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
(EPR) state ΦEPR, which can be formally written as

ΦEPR = lim

ξ→1 |ψξihψξ| .

(3)

Here, the two-mode squeezed state |ψξi with ξ ∈ (0, 1) is
a realistic EPR state and given by

|ψξi := p1 − ξ2

∞

Xn=0

ξn |ni|ni .

(4)

Due to the teleportation-stretching property, any entan-
glement generation through a single use of the channel
is achieved by an additional LOCC process from the
Choi matrix ρE. Similarly, any entanglement generation
through an n-use of the channel can be accomplished by
an entanglement-assisted LOCC protocol starting from
ρ⊗n
. Therefore, any entangled state shared through an
E
n-use of the channel with the help of LOCC can be writ-
ten as

ab = ¯Λ(ρ⊗n
ρn

E

),

(5)

where ¯Λ stands for an LOCC process, and the subscript of
ρab denotes the following condition [10]: The sender Al-
ice prepares an arbitrary quantum state ρaa1a2···an , and
sends an n-mode subsystem a1a2 ··· an to the receiver
Bob with the n-channel use; The ﬁnal subsystem pos-
sessed by Bob is speciﬁed by the index b. Given that the
ﬁnal state ρn
ab is delivered through an LOCC protocol as
in Eq. (5), the monotonicity of entanglement implies that
the amount of entanglement shared between the bipartite
system ab is bounded from above as

ER(ρn

ab) ≤ ER(ρ⊗n
E

),

(6)

where ER is the relative entropy of entanglement (REE),
but this relation could hold for any entanglement mea-
sure. Due to the additivity of ER, we may obtain

ER(ρn

ab) ≤ ER(ρ⊗n
E

) ≤ nER(ρE ).

(7)

From this relation, the amount of entanglement gener-
ated per channel use could be bounded as

ER(ρn

ab)

n

≤

ER(ρ⊗n

E

n

)

≤ ER(ρE ) ≤ − log2(1 − η).

(8)

Notably, the rightmost term − log2(1 − η) is determined
by taking the limit ξ → 1 for ER(I ⊗ Eη(ψξ)) [10]. No-
tably, the rightmost term − log2(1 − η) is determined by
taking the limit ξ → 1 for ER(I⊗Eη(ψξ)) [10]. Hence, the
RHS of Eq. (3) reads that the limitation ξ → 1 is taken
eventually, and until that instance, the ideal EPR state
ΦEPR has to be regarded as a normal state since the RHS
of Eq. (3) is indeterminate by itself. On the other hand,
the central relation in Eq. (5) due to the teleportation-
stretching property, is derived under the assumption of
the ideal EPR state and thus the limit operation ξ → 1 is
likely to be conducted before Eq. (5). To this end, ρE in
the RHS of Eq. (5) seems already indeterminate, and this
could make the subsequent relations [i.e., Eqs. (6) and
(7)] meaningless. This incoherence is obviously coming
from the assumption of the ideal EPR state in Eq. (3),
and verifying the mathematical validity in heuristic use
of such a ﬁctitious state seems diﬃcult.

In this paper, we present a conventional theory of
the teleportation-stretching expansion for Gaussian lossy
channels, and provide the relation essentially equivalent
to Eq. (5) without invoking additional assumptions. We
also extend the result for general single-mode Gaussian
channels. Thereby, we address the question in a related
work [12]: What is a suﬃcient entangled resource state
shared between Alice and Bob for them to prepare an out-
put state E(ρ) at Bob’s station given an arbitrary input
state ρ at Alice’s station under the restriction of LOCC.
This paper is organized as follows. We start reviewing
the teleportation-stretching property for a ﬁnite dimen-
sional system, and develop its counterpart for the pure
lossy channel in Sec. II. A general result for single-mode
Gaussian channels is presented in Sec. III. We conclude
this paper in Sec. IV.

II. TELEPORTATION STRETCHING

A. Finite dimension

We start reviewing the teleportation-stretching prop-
erty for a ﬁnite dimensional system associated with
the standard quantum teleportation process for a d-
dimensional system [13]. Let us write a standard ba-
sis {|ji}d−1
j=0 |ji|ji be a maximally
entangled state, and {|φki = (11 ⊗ σk)|φ0i} with k =

j=0 . Let |φ0i = Pd−1

2

0, 1,··· d2 − 1 be a set of Bell states where 11 is the iden-
tity operator and {σk} represents a set of unitary opera-
tors. We deﬁne a teleportation set {Tk} associated with
a quantum teleportation process from system A to sys-
tem B using the maximally entangled state φ0 between
A′B as

Tk :=AA′hφk|φ0iA′B = σk

d−1

Xj=0

|jiBhj|A .

(9)

This implies an arbitrary input state in system A, say
ρA, is transferred as

TkρAT †k = σkρBσ†k.

(10)

Thereby, adjustment of the additional unitary operators
{σk} accomplishes the standard teleportation process.
A quantum channel E is called teleportation stretch-
able with regard to {Tk} [11] if there exists a set of uni-
tary operators {Uk} such that

E(TkρT †k ) = UkE(ρ)U†k

(11)

holds for any input state ρ and any k. This property can
be equivalently expressed as

LU †

k ◦ E ◦ LTk (ρ) = E(ρ)

when we use a shorthand notation:
LU (ρ) := U ρU†.

(12)

(13)

The main implication of Eq. (12) is that the expression in
the LHS can be regarded as an LOCC process based on
the shared entanglement φ0. To be speciﬁc, knowing the
index of Bell measurement k, the owner of system B can
obtain the channel output E(ρ) applying a unitary oper-
ation locally, as in the ﬁnal step of the standard quan-
tum teleportation process. Therefore, any state trans-
mission through the channel E can be faithfully simu-
lated by an entanglement-assisted LOCC protocol. One
can simulate the channel action by locally applying the
channel E after a standard quantum teleportation proto-
col when the maximally entanglement is shared [12]. In
contrast to this fact, the expression in Eq. (12) tells us
that such a perfect channel simulation can be done with
using a non-maximally entangled state corresponding to
the Choi state

ρE := I ⊗ E(φ0),

(14)

whenever the channel E fulﬁlls the commutation prop-
erty described in Eq. (11). An example of teleportation
stretchable channels is Pauli channels [11].

Note that the property called the LOCC composability
of quantum channels was investigated in Ref. [12]. There,
the main question is to identify an entangled state shared
between Alice and Bob from which they can prepare an
output state E(ρ) at Bob’s station given an arbitrary in-
put state ρ at Alice’s station under the use of LOCC.

The relation in Eq. (12) shows that the Choi state ρE
in Eq. (14) is suﬃcient to accomplish this task when the
channel E is the teleportation stretchable. On the other
hand, it is shown in Ref. [12] that a maximally entan-
gled state whose Schmidt rank is equal to the Schmidt
number of the Choi state ρE is suﬃcient for this task.

where |αi = D(α)|0i denotes a coherent state. Suppose
that ρ is in system A and ψξ is in system A′B, and that
the CV-Bell measurement will be performed on system
AA′, as in the ﬁnite dimensional case of Eqs. (9) and (10).
From Eqs. (4), (16), (18), and (19), and the property of
the displacement operators, a straightforward calculation
leads to

In order to consider the teleportation-stretching prop-
erty in an inﬁnite dimension, an obstacle is that the max-
imally entangled state φ0 in the limit d → ∞ becomes in-
determinate. Instead, we may use the two-mode squeezed
state ψξ in Eq. (4) as an eﬀective maximally entangled
state as in the continuous-variable (CV) quantum tele-
portation scheme by Braunstein and Kimble [14]. As
well as the form of the maximally entangled state, there
should be notable diﬀerences in the form of Bell states
{φk}. For a two-mode bosonic ﬁeld, we may use the si-
multaneous eigenstates of EPR operators,

|Φ0i :=

1

√2π Zx∈R |xi|xi dx.

(15)

where |xi represents the eigenstate of the position
quadrature ˆx, and is normalized by the Dirac-δ function
as hx|x′i = δ(x − x′). CV-Bell states can be deﬁned as
(16)

|Φβi := (11 ⊗ D†(β))|Φ0i

where D(β) = eβa†−β∗a is a displacement unitary opera-
tion with the displacement amount β = 1√2
(x + ip) ∈ C.
A CV-Bell measurement is associated with the following

(17)

With the help of Eq. (18) and another property of the

tion of the Dirac-δ function, and should not be regarded
as physical state vectors (see, e.g., Chapter 4 of Ref. [15]).
ingredient for the teleportation-
stretching property for lossy Gaussian channels is the
property of the displacement covariance. For a pure lossy
channel Eη with the transmission η ∈ (0, 1), it holds that
(18)

Eη(D(β)ρD†(β)) = D(√ηβ)Eη(ρ)D†(√ηβ).

It could be worth noting that a formulation of the
teleportation-stretchable property almost parallel to the
ﬁnite dimensional case is possible if we assume the CV-
Bell state Φ0 is a physical state (See Appendix A).

We consider the stretching process with a two-mode
squeezed state ψξ deﬁned in Eq. (4). Let us use the
Glauber-Sudarshan P representation for an arbitrary in-
put state as

lossy channel Eη ◦ Eη′ = Eηη′ , Eq. (20) implies
Eη(cid:16)Tβ,ξρT †β,ξ(cid:17) =Eη(cid:0)D(ξβ)(cid:0)Eξ2 (˜ρβ)(cid:1) D†(ξβ)(cid:1)

=D(√ηξβ)(cid:0)Eη(cid:0)Eξ2 (˜ρβ)(cid:1)(cid:1) D†(√ηξβ)
=D(√ηξβ)(cid:0)Eηξ2 (˜ρβ)(cid:1) D†(√ηξβ). (23)

This relation is slightly diﬀerent from the formula in
Eq. (11), and the teleportation-stretching property can-
not hold for the realistic CV-teleportation set {Tβ,ξ}.
However, we can show a modiﬁed version of such a prop-
erty suﬃcient to simulate the channel action. We may
say that the pure lossy channel is eﬀectively teleportation-
stretchable regarding the following relation:

Z D†(√ηξβ)Eη (cid:16)Tβ,ξρT †β,ξ(cid:17) D(√ηξβ)dxdp = Eηξ2 (ρ) .

(24)

ρ = Zα∈C

Pα |αihα| d2α,

(19)

This relation can be readily obtained by an application
of LD†(√ηξβ) and integration over β for both sides of
Eq. (23) with the help of Eq. (22). As a counterpart of

the expression in Eq. (12), the following representation
would be helpful:

Z (cid:16)LD†(√ηξβ) ◦ Eη ◦ LTβ,ξ (ρ)(cid:17) dxdp =Eηξ2 (ρ).

(25)

In both the representations in Eqs. (24) and (25), the
expression of the LHSs is regarded as an LOCC process
based on the realistic EPR source ψξ and a single use of
the lossy channel Eη. Therefore, the central implication
of our result is that any transmission through a lossy
channel Eη can be simulated by an entanglement-assisted
LOCC with the resource state generated through another
lossy channel Eη′ and a two-mode squeezed state ψξ. Let
us restate this relation as a theorem:
Theorem.—Let Eη be a pure lossy channel with
trasmission η ∈ (0, 1). For any two-mode state ρAB,
there exists another pure lossy channel Eη′ with η′ ≥ η,
a two-mode squeezed state ψξ, and an LOCC process Λ,
such that

I ⊗ Eη(ρAB) = Λ (ρE ′) ,

where an eﬀective Choi state ρE ′ is deﬁned as

ρE ′ := I ⊗ Eη′(ψξ).

(26)

(27)

The LOCC process can be represented by the eﬀective
teleportation-stretchable condition of Eq. (24) (or equiv-
alently Eq. (25)). The parameters (η′, ξ) can be chosen
so as to satisfy η′ = η/ξ2.

[or

(24)

stretchable property in Eq.
Eq. (25)].

Proof.—Obvious from the eﬀective teleportation-
equivalently,
(cid:4)
Physically, the use of the realistic EPR state ψξ im-
plies a teleportation resource of a non-maximally entan-
gled state. Then, the resultant teleportation cannot be
perfect, and a part of the imperfection is equivalently
induced by a lossy channel as in Eq. (20). Thereby, com-
pensation of the gain seems be essential if one insists that
the unit-gain condition is crucial, although the eﬀect oﬀ
loss is inherently irreversible [16, 17].
In contrast, our
goal here is to simulate the lossy channel Eη, and we thus
rather make use of the imperfection as a natural tool to
execute the precise simulation.

C. Step for a regular proof

Now we can establish a regular step to ﬁnd the bound
of Eq. (1) claimed in Ref. [10] as follows. Since, any
two-mode state transmission can be simulated by an
entanglement-assisted LOCC protocol as in the RHS of
Eq. (26), any state transmission plus LOCC operation
can be also simulated by an entanglement-assisted LOCC
protocol from the Choi state ρE ′. We can apply this
transmission-plus-LOCC process for entanglement gener-
ation based on the transmission of an arbitrary n modes.
Therefore, any entanglement generated by an n-use of

4

channel and LOCC can be achieved by an LOCC proto-
col when ρ⊗n
is shared between the bipartite system ab.
E ′
This establishes a ﬁnite-energy counterpart of Eq. (5) as

ab = ¯Λ(ρ⊗n
ρn
E ′ ).

(28)

Hence, we can ﬁnd an upper bound of entanglement due
to the LOCC monotonicity without additional assump-
tions. For REE, it holds that

ER(ρn

ab) ≤ ER(ρ⊗n
E ′ ).

(29)

We can repeat the ﬂow of Eqs. (6) and (7), and eventually
take the limit ξ → 1 so as to reach the upper bound in
Eq. (1). As a consequence, we can safely remove the
assumption of the ideal EPR resource ΦEPR.

III. COMPOSING SINGLE-MODE GAUSSIAN
CHANNELS VIA ENTANGLEMENT-ASSISTED

LOCC PROTOCOLS

We can expand our stretching property for general
single-mode Gaussian channels, and address the prob-
lem how to simulate single-mode Gaussian channels via
entanglement-assisted LOCC protocols in the sense of
Ref. [12]. Due to the unitary-equivalent decomposition
of single-mode Gaussian channels [18, 19], it is suﬃcient
to consider a couple of speciﬁc channels described by the
unitary-equivalent standard forms. There are essentially
two standard channels (standard forms) which require en-
tanglement for this LOCC task. This is because except
for them the standard channels belong to entanglement
breaking channels, and can be simulated solely by LOCC.
One of the relevant standard channels is the phase-
insensitive channel, which is further divided into the
phase-insensitive lossy channel E N
η , and phase-insensitive
ampliﬁcation channel AN
κ . Here, κ ≥ 1 is the ampliﬁca-
tion gain and N ≥ 0 stands for the excess noise (See
Appendix B for detail). Note that the pure lossy channel
can be written as Eη = E 0
η , and the ampliﬁcation chan-
nel with no excess noise A0
κ is often referred to as the
quantum-limited phase-insensitive ampliﬁer. Essentially
the same displacement-covariance property as in Eq. (18)
holds for both E N
κ satisﬁes
κ (D(β)ρD†(β)) = D(√κβ)AN
AN
Using E N
η instead of Eη in Eq. (23) and following the
steps toward Eq. (24) with the help of Eq. (B6), we ob-
tain the eﬀective stretching property for general lossy
channels

κ . To be speciﬁc, AN

ﬁcation channel AN

reﬁnement yields

where

˜N = N + κ(1 − ξ2)/ξ2.

(32)

(33)

Similar to the case of Eq. (25), the LHS expressions of
Eqs (31) and (32) are regarded as entanglement-assisted
LOCC protocols which precisely reproduce the channel
action of the RHS terms. Therefore, we can identify the
entangled state I ⊗ E N
ηξ−2(ψξ) as a suﬃcient resource to
simulate the channel E N
η , and the entangled state I ⊗
AN
κξ−2 (ψξ) as a suﬃcient resource to simulate the channel
A ˜N
κ .
The other relevant standard channel is the so-called
additive noise channel EANC, which becomes a phase-
insensitive channel when coupled with any ﬁnite loss as
is shown in Theorem 4 of Ref. [20]. Therefore, it can be
simulated as a phase-sensitive channel, practically. Since,
EANC is equivalent to the identity operation except it
adds a ﬁnite noise on a single quadrature variable, an
exact LOCC composition seems necessitate accomplish-
ing the perfect teleportation as the identity operation.
Formally, we can set κ = 1 and ξ → 1 in Eq. (32) to
achieve the perfect teleportation, but we must accept a
ﬁnite error since we assume ξ < 1.

Notably, the quantum limited ampliﬁer A0

κ has the
same constraint that the LOCC simulation comes with a
ﬁnite error. This can be seen from the fact ˜N − N = 0
In sharp contrast,
holds only for ξ = 1 in Eq. (33).

exceptional, although it remains the possibility that A0
or EANC can be perfectly simulated by a diﬀerent LOCC
protocol with the help of a diﬀerent type of entangled
resource.

IV. CONCLUSION AND REMARKS

We have pointed out an illness of the assumption used
in the proof of the tight upper bound of the ultimate
communication rate over a lossy channel in Ref. [10]. We
have developed an eﬀective formula of the teleportation-
stretching property for lossy Gaussian channels. This
enables us to retrieve a sequence of central inequali-
ties appeared in the step of the proof in Ref. [10] with-
out introducing additional assumptions. We have also
extended the resultant formula for general single-mode
Gaussian channels. This extension shows how to simulate
single-mode Gaussian channels via entanglement-assisted

5

LOCC protocol in the sense of Ref. [12]. Our result would
provide a regular path to establish the deﬁnitive form of
the fundamental capacities of optical quantum communi-
cation, and be widely useful to comprehend fundamental
properties between quantum entanglement and quantum
channels. It remains open to what extent one can gener-
alize the present results for multi-mode Gaussian chan-
nels.

Appendix A: Non-physical algebraic relations

If we assume the CV-Bell state |Φ0i is a physical state,

the teleportation set could be deﬁned as

Tβ :=AA′hΦβ|Φ0iA′B =

1
2π

DB(β)Z |xiBhx|A dx.

(A1)

The action of Tβ implies a state transfer from system A
to system B with an addiotional displacement, namely,

Tβ |ϕiA =

1
2π

DB(β)|ϕiB .

(A2)

This superﬁcially shows that an adjustment of the local
displacement D(β) at system B accomplishes the quan-
tum teleportation process.

From Eqs. (A1) and (18), one can write

LD†(√ηβ) ◦ Eη ◦ LTβ (ρ) =

1

(2π)2Eη(ρ).

(A3)

As an analogy with the ﬁnite dimension case of Eq. (12),
one may interpret the LHS of Eq. (A3) as an LOCC pro-
tocol associated with the CV-Bell state Φ0. However, this
is no more than an interpretation because Eq. (A3) over
the integration of β does not give a properly normalized
output density operator.

Note that the ideal EPR state ΦEPR in Eq. (3) has a
diﬀerent normalization compared with the CV-Bell state
Φ0. In fact, its representation in the Fock basis is given
by

|Φ0i = (

∞

Xn=0

|nihn| ⊗ 11)|Φ0i =

1
√2π

∞

Xn=0

|ni|ni .

(A4)

This expression comes from Eq. (15) together with the
fact that the wave function of the Fock states can be real,
i.e., hn|xi = hx|ni.

Appendix B: Single-mode Gaussian channels

We summarize basic description for single-mode Gaus-
sian channels, and useful relations for derivation of
Eqs. (31) and (32).

Any single-mode Gaussian channel can be described
by a triplet of 2-by-2 matrix (K, m, α) [19]. The pair
(K, α) and a 2-by-2 covariance matrix of physical states
γ respectively fulﬁll the physical conditions

α ≥

(B1)

Here, and what follows we may use the following symbols

σ := (cid:18) 0 1

−1 0 (cid:19) , 112 := (cid:18) 1 0

0 1 (cid:19) .

(B2)

The lossy channel E N

(K, 0, α) with

is associated with the triplet

K = √η112, α = (cid:18) 1 − η

+ N(cid:19) 112.

(B5)

The pure lossy channel is the special case of E N
η with
N = 0, i.e, Eη := E 0
η . Using Eqs. (B4) and (B5), we can
obtain the combination relation of the pure lossy channel
Eη◦Eη′ = Eηη′ , which is used in the derivation of Eq. (23).
Similarly, a straightforward calculation leads to a general
formula useful to prove the relation of Eq. (31):

The last equation suggests m is a state-independent con-
stant shift, and we may set m = 0 without notiﬁcation
when the constant displacement makes no physical dif-
ference. We can see that any composition of two Gaus-
sian channels E1 and E2 yields another Gaussian channel
E12 = E2 ◦ E1, and the triplet of E12 fulﬁlls

For a possible
lossy channel
and the ampliﬁcation channel, we can show from
Eqs. (B4), (B5), and (B7) that the relation
