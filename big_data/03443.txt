Abstract

Recently a new no-global-recollapse argument is given for some inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies
that utilizes surface deformation by the mean curvature ﬂow. In this note we discuss important properties
of the mean curvature ﬂow of spacelike surfaces in Lorentzian manifolds. The time evolution of the spatial
scalar curvature that prevents recollapse is determined in normal coordinates, which shows the impact of
inhomogeneities explicitly. Our analysis indicates a caveat in numerical solutions that give rise to inﬂation.

1. Introduction

Inﬂation is the leading early universe paradigm,
which oﬀers a consistent cosmic evolution and in-
herently yields an almost scale invariant cosmolog-
ical perturbations as the seeds of the structure.
However, the basic mechanism deriving inﬂation
and correspondingly the naturalness of its begin-
ning are still questionable (see [1] for an early and
[2] for a recent review). There are diﬀerent ap-
proaches to the initial condition problem of inﬂa-
tion. For example, one may introduce a probability
measure in the phase space and try to determine the
possibility of inﬂation from the set of allowed initial
conditions. In the mini-superspace approximation,
a viable canonical measure with suitable properties
has been proposed in [3] but even in this simpliﬁed
setting the result turned out to be inconclusive as
the measure of the region in the phase space giv-
ing inﬂation diverges [4]. In [5], a physically viable
cutoﬀ has been proposed to obtain a ﬁnite proba-
bility for inﬂation, but as noted in [6] the region
restricted by the cutoﬀ deforms non-trivially under
the Hamiltonian evolution, which weakens the nat-
uralness of the idea (see also [7] for other issues).

According to the general lore, to realize inﬂation
it is enough to have a “small” homogeneous and
isotropic region dominated by an (eﬀective) cosmo-
logical constant. Indeed, inﬂation seems inevitable
in the presence of a cosmological constant since
in an expanding universe it eventually dominates
other sources. Supportively, it is known that in
the presence of a cosmological constant all initially

expanding negative spatial curvature homogeneous
but anisotropic Bianchi cosmologies exponentially
asymptote to de Sitter spacetime [8]. However, this
result has no simple generalization to other cases.
For spatially closed cosmologies, there are theo-
rems characterizing the ﬁnal state of the universe
[9], nevertheless there is no simple answer even for
the closed Friedmann spacetime (see e.g. [10, 11]).
The matter gets more complicated since the inﬂa-
tionary dynamics is supposedly governed by an ef-
fective cosmological constant that must disappear
in time and it is known that some simple scalar
ﬁeld inﬂationary models contain the so-called sud-
den singularities [12, 13, 14, 15]. Besides, inﬂation
is thought to be occurring in an ambient space and
thus surface eﬀects may destroy the expansion since
the interface contracts towards the inﬂating region
(note that while the inﬂating region has negative
pressure the outside has presumably positive pres-
sure) [16]. There are also obstructions in embed-
ding an initially sub-horizon inﬂating region into
a decelerating Friedmann universe imposed by the
null geodesic propagation, which shows that in such
a setup inﬂation also needs large scale homogene-
ity [17]. As discussed in [18], the boundary eﬀects
may even spoil the scale freeness of the cosmological
perturbations.

In an interesting recent paper [19], it is argued
that if the weak energy condition is satisﬁed and
each time slice has a region with negative spatial
scalar curvature, the most general initially expand-
ing inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmology can-

not everywhere recollapse. The argument is based
on the Gauss-Codazzi equation, which in this con-
text becomes the Hamiltonian constraint of general
relativity, and the mean curvature ﬂow of the time
slices. One may see that the mean curvature ﬂow
of any given time slice either yields an extremal
surface with zero mean curvature everywhere or
strictly increases the volume of the surface. When
the weak energy condition is satisﬁed and the spa-
tial scalar curvature is negative somewhere, the ﬁrst
outcome is forbidden by the Gauss-Codazzi equa-
tion. Hence, the mean curvature ﬂow gives spatial
sections with increasing volume and a total recol-
lapse is forbidden. In [19], a lower bound for the
expansion rate is also found.

Curiously, the argument given in [19] only uses
the weak energy condition and one of the constraint
equations of general relativity. Namely, it seems
that the result does not depend on the details of
the dynamical evolution. One may compare the
situation with the singularity theorems that either
suppose the strong energy condition controlling the
dynamics; or the null energy condition, which re-
stricts the constraints, and an additional dynamical
assumption, i.e. the existence of a trapped surface.
This curiosity is the main motivation of the present
work.

2. Mean curvature ﬂow

For a given spacelike surface embedded in a
spacetime, the mean curvature is given by K =
∇µnµ, where nµ is the future directed unit normal
vector to the surface and ∇µ is the covariant deriva-
tive of the spacetime metric. The mean curvature
ﬂow is deﬁned by deforming the surface along the
integral lines of the vector ﬁeld Knµ, i.e.
in local
xµ coordinates, it is given by

dxµ
ds

= Knµ.

(1)

As pointed out in [19], the deformed surface has
strictly larger volume.
It is not diﬃcult to un-
derstand this result intuitively as the ﬂow deforms
a local region forwards in time if it is expanding
(K > 0) or backwards in time if it is contracting
(K < 0). The point on the surface with K = 0 is
an instantaneous ﬁxed point of the ﬂow but as the
nearby region potentially bends, K may no longer
remain zero.

In Euclidean signature the mean curvature ﬂow is
deﬁned to reduce the volume and may become sin-
gular in ﬁnite ﬂow time for non-convex initial data
[20]. In Lorentzian signature, the ﬂow is much more
regular since it increases the volume. In a cosmo-
logical spacetime with compact spatial sections, the
ﬁnite time existence proof is given in [21] provided
the timelike convergence condition

Rµν kµkν ≥ 0

(2)

is satisﬁed for all timelike vectors kµ, where Rµν is
the Ricci tensor (see section 4 of [21]). Assuming
Einstein’s equations

Gµν = Tµν,

(3)

(2) becomes the strong energy condition for matter.
In [22], (2) is relaxed so that in some cases the weak
energy condition can be enough for the regularity.
The ﬂow can be continued as long as the deformed
surface remains smooth and compact. Supposing
the existence of two barrier surfaces, which are lo-
cated to the past and to the future of the initial
surface with everywhere positive K > 0 and neg-
ative K < 0 mean curvatures, the ﬂow (1) exists
for all times and converges uniformly to a spacelike
surface with everywhere vanishing mean curvature
K = 0 (the existence of such a surface has originally
been proved by a diﬀerent method that does not re-
quire any condition of the sort (2), see theorem 6.1
of [23]).

Locally, the mean curvature ﬂow is given by the
functions xµ(s, σi), where σi are the intrinsic coor-
dinates of the surface. The induced metric and the
extrinsic curvature are deﬁned as

hij = ∂ixµ∂jxν gµν,
Kij = ∂ixµ∂jxν∇µnν,

(4)

where ∂i = ∂/∂σi and gµν is the spacetime metric.
The extrinsic curvature can be decomposed as

Kij =

1
3

hijK + σij

(5)

where K is the mean curvature and σij is the shear.
A straightforward calculation yields

∂ixµ = ∂iK.

K 3 − K(σijσij + Rµνnµnν),

t

where Di is the covariant derivative of hij. The bi-
tensor ∂ixµ projects vectors of spacetime into the
tangent space of the surface. From (6), one sees
that the variation of the normal vector is propor-
tional to ∂iK. In the evolution equation of K, the
ﬁrst term gives a diﬀusion eﬀect that smooths out
K. The K 3 term forces |K| to decrease in the form
of a power law in the ﬂow parameter. The last term
explicitly shows the importance of the timelike con-
vergence condition (2), which may otherwise yield
an exponential instability for K.

From the ﬁrst equation in (6), one sees that

ds

= K 2,

(7)

Thin shell

where h = det hij. Consequently the local volume
of the surface increases with the ﬂow. This last
equation also shows that in a smooth evolution the
mean curvature ﬂow preserves the causal structure
of the initially spacelike surface, because otherwise
the timelike normal vector must ﬁrst turn to null
and the induced metric of a null surface degenerates
so that h = 0, which is impossible since h increases
with the ﬂow.

There are singular but physically viable space-
times where the mean curvature ﬂow fails to pre-
serve the causal structure. Consider, for example,
the analytic solution given in [18] that describes an
inﬁnitesimally thin spherical shell with empty ﬂat
interior evolving in a de Sitter spacetime. Physi-
cally, the solution describes a true vacuum bubble
immersed in a false vacuum region and the dynam-
ics can be analyzed by the junction conditions of
[24]. In the ﬂat space coordinates, the trajectory of
the shell radius corresponds to the world-line of a
particle with constant acceleration, which is explic-
itly given by

r =

1
α

cosh(αt),

t =

1
α

sinh(αt),

(8)

where α is ﬁxed by the surface tension and the Hub-
ble parameter of the de Sitter space [18]. The region
to the left of the hyperbola is ﬂat and the right
expands exponentially (in fact for the right hand
side a new coordinate system must be introduced,
see [18]). In this spacetime, think about the mean
curvature deformation of the t = 0 surface, which
has zero mean curvature (K = 0) for r < 1/α and
constant positive mean curvature (K > 0) when
r > 1/α: While the interior is ﬁxed under the ﬂow,
the exterior is pushed arbitrarily forward in time
changing the causal structure of the initial surface,

Figure 1: The motion of an inﬁnitesimally thin spherical shell
that separates an empty ﬂat space (left of the hyperbola)
placed inside a de Sitter space (right of the hyperbola) as
seen by an observer in the ﬂat space. The thick black lines
give the mean curvature ﬂow of the t = 0 surface.

see Fig. 1. Like the spacetime metric, the mean
curvature is discontinuous on the shell and its spa-
tial derivative yields a delta function.

For any given spacelike surface, one can introduce
(Gaussian) normal coordinates (t, xi) so that the
metric becomes

ds2 = −dt2 + hij(t, x)dxidxj ,

(9)

and the surface is described by the equation t = t0.
The extrinsic and the mean curvatures of constant
time slices can be found as

Kij =

1
2

˙hij, K =

hij ˙hij ,

1
2

(10)

where the dot denotes the partial time derivative.
From (1), the ﬁrst iteration of the mean curvature
ﬂow of t = t0 surface gives

t ≃ t0 + K(t0, x)δs,

(11)

where δs is chosen as small as possible. The unnor-
malized normal vector of the new surface is found
as N0 = −1 and Ni = ∂iKδs whose length is given
by

N µNµ = −1 + hij∂iK∂jKδs2.

(12)

One sees that the normal is tilted more towards the
light cone when ∂iK is large. Similarly, the mean
curvature ﬂow maps the two inﬁnitesimally nearby
points on the initial surface (t0, xi) and (t0, xi + ǫi)

3

to

(t0, xi) → (t0 + K(t0, xi)δs, xi),
(t0, xi + ǫi) → (t0 + K(t0, xi + ǫi)δs, xi + ǫi).

The vector connecting these two points, which be-
comes tangent to the deformed surface as ǫi → 0,
can be found as

kµ ≃ (ǫi∂iKδs, ǫi).

(13)
From the norm kµkµ ≃ hijǫiǫj − (ǫi∂iK)2δs2, one
again sees that the surface is tilted more with re-
spect to the reference spacelike slice with increasing

1

phijǫiǫj |ǫi∂iK|,

(14)

which is the directional derivative of K.

3. Spatial scalar curvature

The argument of [19] is based on the existence
of a region with negative spatial scalar curvature in
any given time slice. This can be ensured topolog-
ically if the spacetime is globally R × Σ3 and the
three-dimensional space Σ3 is closed (i.e compact
without boundary), oriented and topologically in
the class of open or ﬂat manifolds. The region hav-
ing negative spatial curvature is by no means ﬁxed
in Σ3 and diﬀerent time slices may have diﬀerent
parts having that property. Namely, the negative
spatial curvature region wanders in Σ3.

Given a spacetime that has the form R × Σ3,
one can introduce normal coordinates xµ = (t, xi)
adapted to Σ3 so that the metric locally becomes

ds2 = −dt2 + hij(t, x)dxidxj.

(15)

Using that the extrinsic curvature of a constant
time surface is given by (10), the Einstein’s equa-
tions (3) yield

which are the Hamiltonian and momentum con-
straints respectively, and

ij are the Ricci scalar and Einstein tensors of hij,
Di is the covariant derivative of hij , Tµν is the to-
tal energy momentum tensor possibly including a
cosmological constant and ρ = T00 is the total en-
ergy density. In these coordinates, the conservation
equation ∇νT µν = 0 decomposes into

˙ρ + DiT 0i + Kρ + KijT ij = 0.
˙T0i + KT0i − DjTji = 0.

(19)

Once the initial conditions for the metric and the
matter ﬁelds satisfying the constraints (16) and (17)
are imposed, (18) can be used to determine the time
evolution.

From (16), one sees that as long as the weak en-
ergy condition is obeyed by matter so that ρ ≥ 0, K
cannot vanish when R(3) < 0. Thus, an expanding
region with R(3) < 0 cannot later start contracting.
However, locally R(3) may increase in time and be-
come positive, which may turn the local expansion
into a contraction. Of course in that case, some
other region in the slice must have negative R(3)
whenever it is topologically required. If the evolu-
tion continues smoothly, the global contraction with
K < 0 is forbidden since the theorem 6.1 of [23] re-
quires the existence of a K = 0 timeslice, which is
impossible by (16) since R(3) < 0 somewhere. How-
ever, singularities may form in regions that start
contracting, while some other regions still expand.
Then, the theorem of [23] looses its validity and
unless it is generalized to deal with these singular-
ities there is no obvious obstruction for an initially
expanding spacetime to later develop singularities
and become totally contracting.

As noted in [19], the Hamiltonian constraint (16)

gives the bound |K| ≥ √3ρ that restricts the ex-

pansion or the contraction rate of a negative R(3)
region. Therefore, in topologically ﬂat or open cos-
mologies there must always be a region obeying this
bound. In an initially expanding universe, if it had
been the case that ˙K < 0, then it would be possible
to deform K < 0 regions of a given slice backwards
in time to obtain a new slice with negative K arbi-
trarily close to zero. Then, the only way to satisfy

the bound |K| ≥ √3ρ would be to assume the exis-
tence of an expanding region with K ≥ √3ρ. But,

from (18) one may ﬁnd that

˙K =

R(3) −

ρ −

(20)

which is the time evolution equation. Here, all in-
dex manipulations are carried out by hij; R(3) and

If the null energy condition ρ+P ≥ 0 is satisﬁed, all
but the ﬁrst term in the right hand side are strictly

4

negative. Nevertheless, a positive R(3) may still
yield ˙K ≥ 0 and in that case uniformly deforming
K < 0 regions backwards in time gives a surface
with larger K.

In the presence of a cosmological constant Λ, the
energy density ρ has a minimum. In that case, one
has the following argument [19]: At early times in
a globally expanding universe there must exist a
time slice with K > √3Λ. If at late times one ﬁnds
a time slice with K < √3Λ, then [23] shows the
existence of a time slice with K = √3Λ, which is
forbidden by (16) when R(3) < 0 (the early and the
late surfaces with K > √3Λ and K < √3Λ are bar-
rier surfaces in the theorem 6.1 of [23]). This shows
that if there is a cosmological constant (and also if
the spacetime is smooth with no singularities) then
each time slice has a region expanding as fast as the
corresponding de Sitter space [19].

Since the spatial scalar curvature plays the cru-
cial role in this discussion, it is useful to determine
its time evolution. From the time derivative of (16),
we obtain a surprisingly simple result

˙R(3) = −

2
3

KR(3) − 2σijR(3)

ij − 2DiT 0i.

(21)

The ﬁrst term dictates the scaling of R(3) under
|R(3)| decreases or increases
time evolution, i.e.
under expansion or contraction, respectively (in
a Friedmann universe it gives the standard k/a2
behavior of the constant spatial curvature). Evi-
dently, this term cannot change the sign of R(3).
Since σij is traceless, the second term is indepen-
dent of R(3) and thus the last two terms in (21) can
be viewed as “external sources” for ˙R(3).

From (19) one sees that the last term in (21)
gives the local energy inﬂow. As discussed in [8]
one expects a positive inﬂow towards an inﬂating
region, which enforces R(3) to increase. Similarly,
the oﬀ-diagonal components of R(3)
is related to
matter stress, and together with the shear σij, they
also aﬀect the time rate of change of R(3). While
the ﬁrst eﬀect can be ascribed to inhomogeneity, the
second can be viewed as the impact of anisotropy.
In an inhomogeneous anisotropic universe, both of
these terms can be large and potentially give large
deviations of R(3) in time.

ij

The above analysis raises the following concern
about the numerical solutions yielding inﬂation.
We saw that as long as R(3) < 0, an initially ex-
panding region cannot recollapse. When the re-
gion expands, the cosmological constant dominates
all other sources and therefore inﬂation has a good

5

chance to start provided R(3) stays negative. On
the other hand, R(3) can only change sign if the
last two terms in (21) are eﬀective. Therefore, by
incidentally choosing initial conditions so that the
last two terms in (21) start out small, one artiﬁcially
increases the possibility of inﬂation. This seems to
be the case (for at least one term) in the recent nu-
merical work [25], which initially sets ˙φ = 0 giving
T0i = ˙φ∂iφ = 0.

Another related concern is that the constraint
equations do not ﬁx the initial values of R(3)
ij and
σij uniquely. Assuming that the initial conditions
of matter are ﬁrst speciﬁed, which is usually the
case in numerical analysis, the constraint equations
are solved for the initial metric data [26], but there
still exists some remaining freedom. This is evident
in normal coordinates where the constraint equa-
tions (16) and (17) only determine R(3). Of course,
the choice (15) does not ﬁx all diﬀeomorphism in-
variance, yet the remaining freedom is larger than
the residual gauge symmetry: After solving all con-
straints and ﬁxing all diﬀeomorphism invariance,
the metric still has two independent degrees of free-
dom, which must be speciﬁed by imposing physi-
cally viable boundary conditions. The danger here
is that one may incidentally choose initial data
without paying attention to this freedom so that
R(3)
ij and σij become small, which may undermine
the evolution of R(3) signiﬁcantly. This seems to be
the case in [27], where the initial metric is chosen
to be ﬂat hij = δij and the initial shear is set to be
zero σij = 0. Clearly, these choices are questionable
in the presence of inhomogeneities and anisotropies.
In the light of the above comments, it would be
interesting to check numerically the impact of the
last two terms in (21) on the beginning of inﬂation.

4. Conclusions

Determining the naturalness of inﬂation is a cru-
cial open problem and we think that the arguments
of [19] give signiﬁcant guidance towards a solution.
The spatial scalar curvature seems to play the key
role in this problem. As the classiﬁcation of the 3-
dimensional closed manifolds is known, it would be
interesting to generalize the story of constant curva-
ture ﬂat, open and closed cosmologies to other pos-
sibilities. The theorems of [21, 22, 23], which show
the existence of time slices with prescribed mean
curvatures, can be used as powerful tools in cosmol-
ogy to infer interesting results. Yet, these theorems

assume certain smoothness properties that may be
absent in realistic scenarios.

Our analysis also indicates a possible delicacy
in selecting the initial conditions in numerical so-
lutions; some simplifying assumptions might gen-
erate hidden eﬀects favoring a dynamical behav-
ior. Since solving the constraints and ﬁxing the
coordinates do not specify the initial spatial met-
ric uniquely, it would be interesting to investigate
how this arbitrariness can be ﬁxed. Given the mat-
ter distribution, this usually requires the imposi-
tion of physically viable boundary conditions like
the fall-oﬀ conditions encountered in the asymptot-
ically ﬂat spacetimes. Another interesting problem
is to ﬁnd a way of characterizing inhomogeneities
and anisotropies. For instance, from (21) one is able
to pin down and interpret the terms aﬀecting the
time evolution of R(3). It might be useful to gener-
alize this analysis to other geometric quantities to
understand how inhomogeneities and anisotropies
aﬀect their evolution.
