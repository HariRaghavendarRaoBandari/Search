Universal Optimal Estimation of the Polarization of Light with Arbitrary Photon

Statistics

(Dated: March 15, 2016)

A universal and optimal method for the polarimetry of light with arbitrary photon statistics is
presented. The method is based on the continuous maximum-likelihood positive operator-valued
measure (ML-POVM) for pure polarization states over the surface of the Bloch sphere. The success
probability and the mean ﬁdelity are used as the ﬁgures of merit to show its performance. The
POVM is found to attain the collective bound of polarization estimation with respect to the mean
ﬁdelity. As demonstrations, explicit results for the N photon Fock state, the phase-randomized
coherent state (Poisson distribution), and the thermal light are obtained. It is found that the es-
timation performances for the Fock state and the Poisson distribution are almost identical, while
that for the thermal light is much worse. This suggests that thermal light leaks less information to
an eavesdropper and hence could potentially provide more security in polarization-encoded quan-
tum communication protocols than a single-mode laser beam as customarily considered. Finally,
comparisons against an optimal adaptive measurement with classical communications are made to
show the better and more stable performance of the continuous ML-POVM.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The polarization of light is an important resource that
has widespread applications. It provides additional in-
formation of the subjects to be inspected in remote sens-
ing [1] and microscopy [2]. It is also used for encoding
information in the most advanced quantum key distri-
bution (QKD) protocols [3, 4].
In fact, the ﬁrst QKD
protocol–BB84–was proposed using the photon polariza-
tion as the information carrier [5].

In classical optics, a common method of determining
the polarization state of a light beam is by measuring its
Stokes parameters [6–8], which is performed by measur-
ing the intensity of the beam in a few ﬁxed measurement
bases of the polarization. To achieve high accuracy, the
light beam should have a suﬃcient number of photons.
For those applications such as quantum communication
and quantum imaging [9] that operate in the low photon
regime, one needs to seek for more eﬃcient approaches
as the Stokes parameters measurement is known to be
non-optimal [10].

The problem of the optimal estimation of a two-
dimensional quantum state (a qubit) like the photon po-
larization has been studied extensively in the past two
decades [10–22]. In those studies, the mean ﬁdelity F [23]
is commonly chosen as a ﬁgure of merit for optimality.
It has been shown that, given N copies of a photon with
an unknown polarization r0 picked from the surface of
the Bloch sphere, the optimal mean ﬁdelity between the
estimate and r0 is Fopt = (N + 1)/(N + 2). This re-
sult can be achieved by collective measurements [12, 13]
or asymptotically by local measurements with classical
communications [18–22].

On the other hand, for practical optical sensing, imag-
ing, and communication applications, the number of pho-
tons of the light beam is usually not known in advance.
Most light sources in fact exhibit a distribution in the
photon number. The decoy-state BB84 protocol even
makes use of varying the mean photon number of the
light pulses to enhance the security of the coherent state-
based BB84 protocol [24, 25].

In this paper, we present a universal continuous posi-
tive operator-valued measure (POVM) for the polarime-
try of multi-photon light beam with arbitrary photon
statistics. We ﬁnd that the POVM is not only optimal by
achieving the collective bound of polarization estimation
with respect to the mean ﬁdelity, it is also optimal by
being the maximum-likelihood (ML) measurement. It is
a multi-photon generalization of the single-photon ML-
POVM in [26].

We apply the ML-POVM to study the optimal mea-
surement when the light beam is a Fock state, a phase-
randomized single-mode laser pulse, and an incoherent
light pulse (a thermal beam). As a demonstration of the
performance, we consider the problem of polarization de-
termination where the number of the diﬀerent polariza-
tions is ﬁnite, which has applications in certain multi-
photon quantum communication protocols [27–30]. We
calculate the success probability of estimating the true
polarization and the mean ﬁdelity, and make a compari-
son between the presented POVM and an optimal adap-
tive local measurement with classical communications.

II. MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD POVM FOR

INCOHERENT MIXTURE OF FOCK STATES

In the following, we consider the scenario where the
photons have a ﬁxed but unknown polarization vector

r0. Unlike the previous studies [10–22] that represent
the quantum state as a tensor product of N copies of a
polarized single photon, we utilize the Fock basis to rep-
resent the multi-photon state. These two approaches are
equivalent to each other, but the latter method provides
a more concise notation when the number of photons is
indeﬁnite.

In the Fock basis, a polarized single photon is given by

|1ir = a†

r|0i, where

in which θ and φ are the spherical coordinates of the po-
larization vector r on the Bloch sphere, and aH and aV
are the annihilation operators for the north pole and the
south pole, which we designate as the horizontal and ver-
tical polarizations respectively. The operator ar satisﬁes
the commutation relation

basis is then produced by applying the creation operator

|nir =

According to quantum estimation theory [34], the
maximum-likelihood POVM Π(r) satisﬁes the following
conditions:

2

[Υ − W (r)] Π(r) = Π(r) [Υ − W (r)] = 0,

and

where

Υ − W (r) ≥ 0,

dr0 p(r0)C(r, r0)ρ(r0) =

W (r) ≡ZS

is the Hermitian risk operator with a uniform prior distri-
bution p(r0) = 1/4π and a delta cost function C(r, r0) =
δ(r − r0). Here Υ is an Hermitian Lagrange operator
deﬁned by

Υ ≡ZS

dr W (r)Π(r).

(8)

Note that the integration is over the Bloch surface S with
dr = sin θdθdφ. We ﬁnd that the operator

Π(r) =

n + 1
4π |nirhn|

(9)

∞

Xn=0

satisﬁes the conditions (5) and (6).

To see that, ﬁrst of all, it should be noted that Eq. (9)
forms a legitimate continuous POVM (in r), viz., Π(r) >

In the following analysis, we focus on a light beam with
certain photon statistics speciﬁed by the photon number
distribution Pn instead of a coherent superposition of the
n photon state (3). The quantum state in this case is
written as

I ≡

ρ(r) =

(4)

This is motivated by the fact that the phase information
is usually dismissed intentionally in quantum communi-
cation to increase security [31, 32], or the phase is simply
unavailable as in incoherent imaging and remote sensing
that operate in the photon-counting mode. In addition,
this simpliﬁcation allows us to write the optimal POVM
explicitly. It should be noted that ρ(r) is a mixed state in
the photon number, not in the polarization as considered
in [33].

To quantify the optimality of the measurement, the
ﬁdelity [23] is usually chosen as the ﬁgure of merit for
the purpose of quantum state tomography. On the other
hand, in quantum communication, one is more concerned
about the error of estimating the correct bit value. In this
respect, the maximum-likelihood measurement provides
a more natural choice. These two quantities nevertheless
are connected as to be discussed in the next section.

space and In is the identity operator of the n photon
subspace. In addition, substituting Eqs. (7) and (9) into
Eq. (8), we obtain

Υ =

PnIn,

(12)

which is Hermitian. Then Eq. (5) is easily veriﬁed by
substituting Eqs. (7), (9) and (12) into Eq. (5). To prove
Eq. (6), we ﬁrst organize the operator Υ − W (r) into a
more suggestive form:
∞

Υ − W (r) =

Pn (In − |nirhn| ⊗ |0i−rh0|) ,

(13)

where the polarization −r is perpendicular to r. Now In
can be expanded in any orthogonal polarization bases:

In =

|mirhm| ⊗ |n − mi−rhn − m|.

(14)

Therefore Υ − W (r) is a non-negative deﬁnite operator.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE CONTINUOUS

MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD POVM

The maximum-likelihood estimate of the initial polar-

ization r0 given the POVM polarimeter’s output r is

r0ML = arg max
r∈S

P (r|r0) = r,

(15)

where P (r|r0) is the likelihood function with the ML-
POVM:

(16)

Pn |frr0|2n .

P (r|r0) = Tr [Π(r)ρ(r0)] =

Xn=0
As mentioned earlier, |frr0|2 = 1
2 (1 + r · r0) is the ﬁdelity
between the polarizations r and r0.
Certain cases of the given prior photon distribution Pn
admit closed-form expressions for the likelihood function.
For example, the N photon Fock state with Pn,N = δnN
gives PN (r|r0) = (N + 1)|frr0|2N /4π, the Poisson distri-
bution Pn,Poi = e−¯n¯nn/n! with a mean photon number
¯n describing a phase-randomized single-mode laser beam
gives

PPoi(r|r0) =

e−¯n(cid:16)1−|frr0|2(cid:17)

4π

(cid:16)1 + ¯n|frr0|2(cid:17) ,

and the Bose-Einstein distribution Pn,th = ¯nn/(1+ ¯n)n+1
modeling a thermal beam gives

(17)

(18)

Pth(r|r0) =

1

4π(1 + ¯n)(cid:16)1 − ¯n

1+¯n |frr0|2(cid:17)2 .

As expected, the maxima of these likelihood functions
occur at |frr0|2 = 1 when r = r0. Moreover, the likeli-
hoods behave like the delta function δ(1 − |frr0|2) in the
large (mean) photon number limit. On the other hand,
when the (mean) photon number tends to zero, the prob-
ability approaches the constant 1/4π independent of the

3

ﬁdelity, which corresponds to the scenario the same as a
random guess. As an illustration, a plot of the likelihood
function for the Poisson distribution against the mean
photon number ¯n and ﬁdelity |frr0|2 is shown in Fig. 1.
For quantum communication applications such as the
αη protocol [27], Y00 protocol [28] and the three-stage
protocol [29, 30] that utilize the polarization states in
diﬀerent bases to encrypt the bit values, it is useful to
determine the optimal success probability of estimating
the polarization when the knowledge of the basis is ab-
sent in order to bound the potential information leak to
the eavesdropper. Since the polarization states on the
Bloch sphere is continuous, we need to deﬁne a ﬁnite re-
gion for any polarization vector so as to obtain a nonzero
estimation probability. Here we choose the ﬁnite region
Sǫ(r0) in the form of a circle on S around r0 with an an-
gular diameter 2ǫ where ǫ ∈ [0, π]. Therefore, the success
probability reads as
(cid:19)n+1

Pn(cid:18) 1 + cos ǫ

Q(ǫ) ≡ZSǫ(r0)

dr P (r|r0) = 1 −

(19)
where the factor (1 + cos ǫ)/2 is the ﬁdelity of a qubit
with a neighboring qubit at an angle ǫ away. We then
obtain the closed forms for the Fock state, the Poisson
distribution, and the thermal distribution:

,

(22)

where the approximations correspond to the small ǫ limit.
The success probabilities Q(ǫ) when ǫ = 0.2π are
shown in Fig. 2 (solid curves). It should be noted that
the error probability 1 − QN for the Fock state exhibits
the exponential decay of the quantum Chernoﬀ bound for
the discrimination of two quantum states [35]. Interest-
ingly, the success probability of the Poisson distribution
bears the same scaling as that of the Fock state. For
the thermal distribution, its error probability decreases
as ¯n−1, which is much slower than the other two cases.
From the perspective of quantum communication proto-
cols in [27–30], these results suggest that polarized light
from a thermal source potentially is more secure than
a single-mode laser beam as customarily considered. It
is noticeable that the success probability has a non-zero
value (1− cos ǫ)/2 ≈ 0.095 for the vacuum state scenario.
This is because the ﬁnite region deﬁned for a success
estimate gives a non-zero success probability even for a
random guess.

To compare with the results of previous studies, we
also calculate the mean ﬁdelity using the continuous ML-
POVM, which is given by

the mean performance while the success probability gives
the point-wise performance. In addition, Eq. (16) is es-
sentially a function of the ﬁdelity. In fact, the likelihood
can be shown to be proportional to the probability den-
sity function of the ﬁdelity.

This is the same as the bound obtained by collective mea-

where the approximations correspond to the large mean

mean ﬁdelities under the three scenarios (solid curves).
Similar to the success probability, the mean ﬁdelity of the
Poisson distribution approaches that of the Fock state
very quickly, while it increases at a much slower rate for
the thermal distribution.

As mentioned previously, the success probability and
the mean ﬁdelity are connected. This can be seen
from the deﬁnition of the successful region Sǫ(r0) which
includes all the polarization vectors r with a ﬁdelity
|frr0|2 ≤ 1
2 (1 + cos ǫ). Therefore the mean ﬁdelity gives

IV. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ML-POVM

AND AN OPTIMAL ADAPTIVE

MEASUREMENT WITH CLASSICAL

COMMUNICATIONS

In this section, we compare the performances of the
presented ML-POVM against an optimal measurement,
the greedy scheme [20], with respect to the success prob-
ability and the ﬁdelity. The greedy scheme utilizes an
adaptive local measurement with classical communica-
tions to measure the polarization state given n copies of
a polarized single photon. The classical communications
is reﬂected by the fact that the current operations can
depend on the previous steps.

The greedy scheme works in this way: for the ﬁrst three
photons, the measurement bases are taken to be the x,
y and z directions. For the kth measurement with k ≥ 4,
the measurement basis is chosen to be the direction mk,
which is found by maximizing the mean ﬁdelity of the
current step based on the measurement results of the (k−
1)th step (see [20] for detail). The measurement outcome
through the n steps is denoted by χn = inin−1 ··· i2i1
where ik is kth outcome with ik = 0 if the photon detector
in the direction mk clicks and ik = 1 if the detector in
the orthogonal direction clicks. The likelihood function

after the n-step measurements reads as

P (g)(χn|r0) =

|V(χn)|! ,

(27)

(28)

(29)

in which the summation runs over all the possible val-
ues for χn. Note that the measure of mean ﬁdelity for
the greedy scheme as in Eq. (29) is derived from Eq.
(2.3) in [20], which is identical to that for the ML-POVM
method as in Eq. (23). They are both the same as the
mean Uhlmann ﬁdelity for pure states. This method has
been proven to be better than ﬁxed-basis measurement
schemes, such as the Stokes parameters measurement,
and it can approach the collective bound in a quick man-
ner. It is also the best local operation with classical com-
munications one can perform when the photon number
is unknown in advance.

It is remarked that the number of the possible measure-
ment directions mk for the kth measurement is 2k − 1.
They in principle can be computed in advance so that
the measurements can be performed rapidly. However,
when n is large, i.e., n > 20, it is quite impractical to
perform the computation, and as a consequence, one is
unable to obtain a closed-form expression for the mean
ﬁdelity based on Eq. (26).

To proceed, we apply the greedy scheme to the anal-
ysis here by assuming that the n photon Fock state can
be separated into n individual single photons. Experi-
mentally, this could in principle be done by using many
beam splitters to separate the input Fock state so that
the outputs of the beam splitters are either a vacuum
state or a single photon state with high probability. In
addition, according to the quantum states represented in
Eq. (4), one obtains a beam containing n photons with
probability Pn. Therefore, the mean ﬁdelity is calculated

We have performed numerical simulations using 104
samples. The success probability and the mean ﬁdelity
are plotted in Fig. 2 (dotted curves) and Fig. 3 (dotted
curves) respectively. The bumps on the curves are due
to the randomness in the simulations. For the Fock state
and the Poisson distribution, the two quantities using

the greedy scheme are smaller than those using the ML-
POVM in the low photon regime. These two methods
approach the same performance when the mean number
of photons is suﬃciently large. The greedy scheme always
performs worse than the ML-POVM because it uses the
information of the photons one by one sequentially and
optimizes the mean ﬁdelity merely based on the previous
immediate measurement. This is in contrast to the ML-
POVM which is a collective measurement that uses the
information of all the photons in a single step. For the
thermal distribution, it is seen that the ML-POVM is
signiﬁcantly better than the greedy scheme even when
the mean photon number is large. This can be explained
by the fact that, for the thermal distribution, there are
always more contributions from the small photon number
states than from the large photon number states, and the
former tend to lower the mean ﬁdelity.

As mentioned earlier, the mean ﬁdelity only gives the
average performance of the polarization estimation. In
actual estimations, the ﬁdelities obtained for diﬀerent un-
known r0’s can vary with a large range depending on the
estimation method as well as the photon number distri-
bution. Therefore, to demonstrate the stability of the
presented methods, we also calculate the variances of the
ﬁdelities under diﬀerent initial polarizations. The vari-
ance of the continuous ML-POVM reads as

∆2F =

(30)

The explicit forms for the Fock state, the Poisson dis-
tribution and the thermal distribution are respectively

∆2Fth(¯n) =

(1 + ¯n)(cid:16)¯n2 − (1 + ¯n) (log (1 + ¯n))2(cid:17)

. (33)

On the other hand, the variance using the greedy
scheme is calculated from the numerical simulations. Fig-
ure 4 depicts the plots of the standard deviations (error
bars) using the ML-POVM (red solid curves) and the
greedy scheme (blue dotted curves). We have performed
the simulations using diﬀerent number of samples and
the standard deviations are found to exhibit only small
variations due to the randomness in the sampling. It is
remarked that even though the mean ﬁdelity plus one
standard deviation can be greater than one, the actual
ﬁdelity found is always between zero and one. The vari-
ance only gives a rough estimate of the range of the pos-
sible ﬁdelity values.

ation of the ML-POVM scheme is much smaller than

6

that of the greedy scheme for both Fock state and Pois-
son distribution, and they decrease quickly with the in-
creasing mean photon number. It suggests that the ML-
POVM method is a more stable scheme than the greedy
scheme with respect to the ﬁdelity, and the higher the
mean photon number is, the more stable the method
gets. On the other hand, the standard deviation for
the thermal distribution is much larger than that for the
other two scenarios and it decreases at a much slower
rate. These can be shown from Eqs. (31)–(33), where we
ﬁnd ∆FN ∼ ∆FPoi ∼ ¯n−1 and ∆Fth ∼ ¯n−1/2 when the
(mean) photon number ¯n is large. Once again this im-
plies that the thermal light can provide higher security
for multi-photon polarization-encoded quantum commu-
nication protocols.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper, a method of measuring any polariza-
tion of multi-photon state with arbitrary photon number
statistics is investigated.
It is achieved by performing
a continuous positive operator-valued measure, which is
optimal by being a maximum-likelihood measurement.
The likelihood function of the estimate r is found explic-
itly given the prior photon distribution. These results
provide the computational tools for applications such as
the theoretical security analysis of multi-photon quan-
tum communication. In particular, we study the cases of
the Fock state, the Poisson distribution, and the thermal
distribution in detail in terms of the success probability
and the mean ﬁdelity. Surprisingly, the Poisson distri-
bution with mean photon number N , which can model
a phase-randomized coherent state, performs almost as
good as an N photon Fock state. In addition, we ﬁnd
that the thermal distribution always gives a much worse
estimate than the other cases. This suggests that thermal
light sources such as light-emitting diodes or a laser beam
containing many incoherent modes may achieve a more
secure information transmission than the commonly used
coherent laser beam in multi-photon quantum communi-
cation protocols.

We also compare the ML-POVM against an optimal
adaptive local measurement with classical communica-
tions (the greedy scheme). For the cases of Fock state
and Poisson distribution, both the success probability
and the mean ﬁdelity show larger values for the con-
tinuous ML-POVM in the low photon regime. For the
thermal distribution, the ML-POVM is signiﬁcantly bet-
ter than the greedy scheme even when the mean photon
number is large. It is also noticeable that the ML-POVM
method is a more stable scheme from the perspective of
the ﬂuctuation of the estimation ﬁdelity. Again, the po-
larization information retrieved from the thermal light is
much less stable than the other two cases.

Finally, one may wonder how the continuous ML-
POVM could be implemented experimentally. One pos-
sibility would be to follow the discretized polarimeter for

the single photon ML-POVM in [26], which operates by
splitting the single photon into M diﬀerent paths, and on
each of the M output modes, a standard projective po-
larization analysis is performed. To extend the scheme to
the multi-photon situation as discussed here, the single-
photon detector at each of the output mode is simply
replaced by a photon-number resolving detector. How-
ever, in order to realize the ML-POVM in Eq. (9), only
the events of all photons going to one of the paths will
be used; the many more other events will have to be dis-
carded, making this scheme not practical. Nevertheless,
since the presented ML-POVM works for arbitrary pho-

7

ton statistics, it may be possible that the discarded events
could be retained if some proper post-processing of the
data is made by taking into account the beam splitting
process. This will be a topic of further investigation.
