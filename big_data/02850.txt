The two-dimensional metal forming at the interface between an oxide insulator and SrTiO3 pro-
vides new opportunities for oxide electronics. However, the quantum Hall eﬀect (QHE), one of the
most fascinating eﬀects of electrons conﬁned in two dimensions, remains underexplored at these
complex oxide heterointerfaces. Here, we report the experimental observation of QHE in a SrTiO3
heterointerface based on the modulation-doped amorphous-LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure, which
exhibits both high electron mobility exceeding 10,000 cm2/Vs and low carrier density on the or-
der of ∼1012 cm−2. Along with unambiguous Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, the spacing
of the quantized Hall resistance suggests that the interface is comprised of a single quantum well
with 10 parallel conducting two-dimensional subbands. This provides new insight to the electronic
structure of conducting oxide interfaces and represents an important step towards designing and
understanding advanced oxide devices.

Quantization of the Hall resistance - the quantum Hall
eﬀect (QHE), arises from quantization of the cyclotron
motion of charge carriers subjected to a perpendicular
magnetic ﬁeld, and represents an example of a quan-
tum phenomenon that can be observed on a macroscopic
scale. The cyclotron motion becomes quantized when
electrons complete enclosed orbits without being scat-
tered, and the observation of the QHE therefore requires
materials of high purity with high carrier mobility. Con-
sequently, it has only been observed in a few material sys-
tems such as semiconductor heterostructures based on sil-
icon [1] or III-V compounds [2], Bi2Se3 [3] and graphene
[4]. Recent technical advances in the atomic-scale growth
of oxide thin ﬁlms have resulted in the creation of high-
mobility two-dimensional electron gases (2-DEGs) at het-
erointerfaces based on either ZnO [5, 6] or SrTiO3 (STO)
[7, 8]. Remarkably, the mobility enhancement made in
polar MgZnO/ZnO heterostructures has led to the ob-
servation of both integer and fractional quantum Hall
eﬀect in all-oxide devices [5, 6, 9]. The conducting
states of ZnO-based heterostructures are, however, sim-
ilar to the conventional semiconductor heterostructures,
derived from sp hybrid orbitals with a covalent bond na-
ture.
In contrast, the interface conductivity in STO-
based heterostructures originates from less overlapping
Ti 3d -orbitals, where the resulting ionic bonds lead to a
strong coupling between the lattice, charge and spin de-
grees of freedom. The strong electronic correlations give
rise to a variety of properties, such as gate-tunable su-
perconductivity, magnetism and tunable metal-insulator
transitions [10–14], which has generated particular inter-
est in STO-based heterostructures [15].

Theoretical calculations predict that the metallic con-

ductivity of STO-based heterostructures originates from
degenerate Ti 3d t2g levels [16–19] with the orbital occu-
pation strongly depending on the carrier density. For a
threshold carrier density below ∼1014 cm−2, electrons are
generally conﬁned within a thin sheet of STO in Ti 3dxy
levels which are characterized by strong in-plane coupling
parallel to the interface. Above this threshold density,
electrons begin to populate the 3dxz/yz levels, which ex-
tend further away from the interface and add out-of-plane
coupling to the electronic system [20]. For the intensively
investigated LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interface [21],
experiments indicate that the threshold Hall carrier den-
sity is about 1.7×1013 cm−2. To improve the under-
standing of the conﬁned electronic system, the Fermi sur-
faces of STO-based heterointerfaces have been probed by
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in the longitudinal
resistance, Rxx [8, 22–26]. Notably, in all these studies
the carrier density deduced from SdH oscillations, nSdH
,
is often more than one order of magnitude lower than
that obtained by the Hall eﬀect, nHall
. This discrep-
ancy has been ascribed to that only a small fraction of
the carriers contribute to the SdH oscillations [8, 22–26].
Moreover, although the two-dimensional nature of the in-
terface conductivity is demonstrated by the dependence
of the SdH oscillations on magnetic ﬁeld tilt angle, only
a few studies report plateau-like structures in the Hall
resistance, Rxy [24, 25]. Additionally, full analysis of the
quantization-like Hall resistance in these studies were dif-
ﬁcult due to irregular SdH oscillation spectra [24, 25].
Consequently, a clear QHE with well-deﬁned quantized
Hall plateaus coinciding with SdH oscillation minima re-
mains undemonstrated at complex oxide interfaces. Here,

N a scaling factor equalling 10 and η = 1±0.2. This man-
ifestation of the QHE is diﬀerent from what usually is
observed in conventional semiconductors, MgZnO/ZnO
or other two-dimensional materials [1–6, 9], highlighting
the exotic nature and potential opportunities of complex
oxide electronic devices. As will become clear later, our
results are consistent with the oxide interface being com-
prised of a single quantum well hosting 10 parallel con-
ducting Ti 3dxy subbands, which is in contrast to the
usual situation in LAO/STO where all t2g levels (Ti 3dxy
and 3dxz/yz subbands) are occupied.

The modulation-doped oxide interface used in this
study is realised by inserting a single unit cell of
La7/8Sr1/8MnO3
the inter-
face between amorphous-LAO (a-LAO) grown at room
temperature and the crystalline STO substrate (a-
LAO/LSM/STO) [27]. A Hall bar device is fabricated
(see Fig. 1a-c) by conventional electron-beam lithogra-
phy and an oxide hard mask as described elsewhere [28].
Low temperature electrical transport measurements are
performed on the patterned Hall bar device using a stan-
dard AC lock-in technique (IAC = 10 nA, fAC = 77.03
Hz) in a dilution refrigerator at temperatures between
30 mK and 3 K, gate potentials between −5 V and 10
V and with magnetic ﬁelds between 0 T and 12 T. Sam-
ple rotation along the axis perpendicular with the Hall
bar source-drain channel (aligned within < 5◦) between
0◦ and ∼82◦ is achieved by a piezoelectric rotator. Fit-
ting of the SdH oscillations is done by considering the
analytical expression adopted from Coleridge et al. [29].
Density functional theory-based tight binding (DFT-TB)
calculations of the triangular quantum well are based on
the tight binding approach outlined by Zhong et al. [30].
The Hall bar device shows n-type metallic conductiv-
ity similar to the unpatterned interface [27] with an sheet
= 1/(e·RH ) ∼5.6×1012 cm−2 where
carrier density nHall
RH = dRxy/dB is the Hall coeﬃcient, and a Hall car-
·Rxx) ∼8,703 cm2/Vs,
rier mobility, µHall = 1/(e·nHall
at 2 K and zero applied back gate potential, Vg = 0 V.
This mobility is among the highest reported values for
patterned complex oxide interfaces which typically is be-
low ∼1000 cm2/Vs at 2 K [31, 32].
Importantly, such
an enhanced mobility, along with a relatively low carrier
density, could allow observation of the QHE. Indeed as we
previously reported [27], Rxx as a function of magnetic
ﬁeld, B, shows clear oscillations which qualitatively agree
with being SdH oscillations.
In the present study, we
moreover observe that Rxx(B ) ∼ Rxx(−B ) and Rxy(B )
∼ −Rxy(−B ) (Supplemental Material (SM) Fig. S1),
and therefore the subsequent measurements only con-
cerns positive magnetic ﬁeld direction.
In order to ex-
amine the Fermi surface of the electronic system beyond
what we previously reported [27], we further investigated
the dependence of Rxx(B ) and Rxy(B ) on temperature,
magnetic ﬁeld tilt angle and back gate potential, Vg.

netic ﬁelds, an apparent spin-degeneracy occurs when
the spin-down part of LL n overlaps with the spin-up
part of LL n + 1 (SM Fig. S3). Thus, the system
becomes fully spin-resolved only at ﬁelds above ∼6 T.
For a fully resolved spin-split electronic system without
valley degeneracy (for f1), this leads to a carrier den-

ably is ∼10 times lower than nHall
This discrepancy is consistent with previous analysis of
SdH oscillations at STO-based interfaces [8, 22–26]. Fi-
nally, the quantum mobility is extracted in Fig. 2d by
plotting the 1/B -dependency of the absolute reduction
of the oscillation amplitude using the Dingle formula
[29]: ln((∆Rxx(B )sinh(αT ))/(4Rxx(B =0T)αT )) where,
α = 2π2kB/¯hωc, ωc = eB /m∗, and Rxx(B =0T) = 128
Ω/sq. At temperatures between 30 mK and 0.7 K, these
so-called Dingle plots, reveal a quantum mobility, µq
of ∼2350 cm2/Vs, and a corresponding quantum elas-
tic scattering time, τq of ∼1.7 ps (see Fig. 2d). This
quantum mobility is approximately one order of mag-
nitude higher than that obtained for the all-crystalline
LAO/STO interface [22–24], and is comparable to the
high electron mobility observed at the spinel/perovskite
γ-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface [8]. We note that the ex-
tracted parameters (m∗, µq, τq) are insensitive to how
the background is deﬁned (SM Fig. S2).

When tilting the magnetic ﬁeld angle we ﬁnd that
the oscillation amplitudes decrease rapidly. Notably,
the SdH oscillations in Rxx almost disappear at angles
above ∼40◦, consistent with the electronic system being
strongly conﬁned at the interface (SM Figs. S4,5).
The Rxx(B ) and Rxy(B ) traces changes signiﬁcantly
as the applied back gate voltage, Vg, is varied from −5
V to 10 V (see Fig. 3a,b). Speciﬁcally, the Hall carrier
, changes from 3.0×1012 cm−2 to 7.8×1012
density, nHall
cm−2 and the Hall mobility, µHall, from 5760 cm2/Vs to
11,416 cm2/Vs for Vg = −5 V to 10 V (SM Fig. S6a-
b). For the diﬀerent gate voltages, ∆Rxx shows clear
oscillations with a 1/B periodicity (see Fig. 3c) and ex-
tracting the fully spin-resolved SdH oscillation frequency
for the diﬀerent gate voltages results in a correspond-
changing from ∼3.8×1011 cm−2 to 8.5×1011
ing nSdH
cm−2 for Vg = −5 V to 10 V (SM Fig. S6c). Notably,
nHall
in the full range of the investi-
gated Vg (SM Fig. S6d). The most remarkable feature
is that the Hall resistance develops a step-like behaviour
with well-deﬁned quantum Hall plateaus upon increase
of the back gate potential from −5 V to 10 V (see Fig.
3b). Note that, all Hall resistance plateaus, chosen to
be at the minimum position of dRxy/dB, coincide with
minima in Rxx as expected from the QHE and Fig. 3d
shows the value of 1/Rxy at the plateaus in units of e2/h
as a function of gate voltage. Strikingly, R−1
xy does not
appear to assume integer values of e2/h. This is diﬀerent
from QHE in the conventional semiconductor quantum

reduce upon heating and the carrier eﬀective mass,
m∗, is extracted by ﬁtting the temperature dependent
term in the Ando relation [33]: ∆Rxx(T )/∆Rxx(T0)
= T sinh(αT0)/T0sinh(αT ) where, T0 = 30 mK, α =
2π2kB/¯hωc, ωc = eB /m∗, and kB is the Boltzmann con-
stant (Fig. 2c). The eﬀective mass, m∗, is found to be
between 1.03-1.40 me, similar to typical values reported
for the all-crystalline LAO/STO interfaces [22–24]. Also
apparent in Fig. 2b are two diﬀerent 1/B frequencies,
f1 = 0.040 T−1, and f2 = 0.078 T−1 diﬀering by a fac-
tor of ∼2 consistent with a transition from an apparent
spin-degenerate to a fully spin-resolved electronic system
at B ≈ 6 T (SM Fig. S3). Note that this apparent
spin-degeneracy is diﬀerent from that found in conven-
tional semiconductors due to the much larger eﬀective
mass in oxides leading to a Landau level (LL) splitting,
¯hωc comparable with the Zeeman splitting, gµBB (g is
the g-factor and µB the Bohr magneton). Using a g-
factor [34, 35], of 2, the Zeeman and LL splitting ener-
gies (for m∗ = 1.30 me) at B = 6 T become 0.70 meV
and 0.54 meV, respectively.
In this case, the intrin-
sic spin-degeneracy should be lifted at all ﬁelds where
SdH oscillations are observed. However, at low mag-

we recognize that the modulation-doped oxide interface
may consist of multiple parallel conducting channels that
collectively give rise to a combined QHE. Indeed, such
electronic systems have previously been demonstrated to
display a combined QHE [3, 38]. For instance, conduc-
tion through highly doped Bi2Se3 occurs through multi-
ple quantum wells, and gives rise to quantized Hall re-
h where η = 1±0.2
sistance plateaus with R−1
and N being the number of quantum wells [3]. However,
in that case the quantum wells are almost uncoupled with
identical charge carrier densities and almost behave like
a classic Kronig-Penney model. On the other hand, due
to band bending in STO, the charge carrier density in
our parallel electronic channels is expected to vary across
the diﬀerent channels [17, 18] and the R−1
xy quantization
is not expected to assume integer values of e2
h . This is
a consequence of the measured ﬁlling factor, ν(B ), being
an average of the ﬁlling factors of each channel, νi(B ),
which take integer values at diﬀerent B -ﬁelds owing to
their diﬀerent carrier densities (SM, Sec. S1). However,
the step size, ∆R−1
xy , between plateaus is expected to take
integer values of N e2
h (SM, Sec. S1) where N is the num-
ber of parallel conducting channels.

In order to quantitatively address whether such paral-
lel electronic channels with varying charge carrier density
can account for the observed Rxx oscillations and Rxy
plateaus, the data is ﬁtted (SM, Sec. S2 & Figs. S10
and S11) by summing contributions from N = 10 paral-
lel conducting channels either apparent spin-degenerate
(for B <6T) or spin-resolved (for B >6T). Here, the an-

Sec. 1). Moreover, R−1
xy for the same plateau varies as
a function of gate voltage, contrary to the case in con-
ventional semiconductors where it remains constant [1].
The plateaus, however, appear regularly spaced for all
xy ∼10±2 e2/h or ∆R−1
gate voltages with either ∆R−1
∼20±2 e2/h for B > 6 T and B < 6 T, respectively. As-
suming a fully spin-resolved or apparent spin-degenerate
situation where ∆ν = 1 or 2, respectively, the inverse Hall
xy = η·N·∆ν· e2
resistance at plateaus is spaced by ∆R−1
where N = 10 and η = 1±0.2. We note that the overall
linearity of the Hall resistance and the relative ﬂatness of
the Hall plateaus at high gate voltages and magnetic ﬁeld
suggest that the contribution from a low-mobility parallel
conducting channel is negligible. And indeed, the scaling
factor η·N ∼ 10±2 remains the same when considering
the contribution from a low-mobility parallel conducting
channel [36, 37] not in the SdH regime (SM, Fig. S7,
S8 and S9). Xie et al. observed quantization-like Hall
resistance at the LAO/STO interface [24] with a spacing
that scaled with N ∼4. This was explained by a break-
ing of the fundamental band symmetry through magnetic
breakdown orbits, however, this explanation cannot ac-
count for a scaling factor of η·N ∼ 10±2 observed here.
A consistent description of the data, however, appears if

For Vg = 0 V and Vg = 6 V (see Fig. 4a,b), there is
an excellent agreement between the measured Rxx oscil-
lations subtracted a magnetoresistance background and
the calculated Rxx traces with ﬁtted values of ni as illus-
trated in Fig. 4c,d. Furthermore, R−1
xy calculated using
the ﬁtted charge carrier densities agrees well with the
measured plateau values for both Vg = 0 V and Vg = 6

xy variation
observed in Fig. 3d for the two gate voltages consid-
ered, Vg = 0 V and Vg = 6 V. Ultimately, we believe
that this physical picture is representable for the entire
gate-voltage range investigated, i.e. that the 10 paral-
lel conducting electronic channels are responsible for the
observed Rxx oscillations and Rxy plateaus from Vg =
−5 V to 10 V. In other words, the modulation-doped ox-
ide interface consists of multiple parallel conducting two-
dimensional channels with similar eﬀective mass, Hall
mobility and quantum mobility, whereas the charge car-
rier density of diﬀerent channels vary greatly. Upon
application of an electric ﬁeld all channels will popu-

. Moreover, the number of chan-

nels is expected to increase/decrease when the electronic
system is populated/depleted suﬃciently beyond the in-
vestigated gate voltage range of Vg = −5 V to 10 V.

To further understand the nature of the parallel con-
ducting channels, DFT-TB calculations are performed
considering a wedge-shaped triangular quantum well
(SM, Sec. S3). Figure 5a shows the obtained charge
carrier dispersions for Vg = 0 V and Vg = 6 V (left
and right panels, respectively). These calculations sup-
port, for both Vg = 0 V and Vg = 6 V, the existence of
10 occupied Ti 3dxy subbands that have similar eﬀective
mass, Hall mobility and quantum mobility, and calcu-
lated charge carrier densities which are consistent with
those obtained from the ﬁt to the experimental data (see
Fig. 4c,d). Therefore, our modulation-doped oxide in-
terface, a single quantum well with multiple occupied Ti
3dxy subbands (see Fig. 5c), is quite diﬀerent from what
is found in the canonical LAO/STO interface, where all
t2g levels (both Ti 3dxy and 3dxz/yz subbands) usually
are occupied in the quantum well (see Fig. 5b,c). This
diﬀerence is caused by a much lower carrier density in
a-LAO/LSM/STO compared to LAO/STO due to the

having a shallow quantum well and only Ti 3dxy subbands
occupied opposed to the c-LAO/STO interface which holds a
very deep quantum well with both Ti 3dxy and 3dxz/yz sub-
bands occupied. Note that the depth of the quantum wells is
not drawn to scale.

LSM spacer-layer in the former case acting as an electron
acceptor [27]. With a reduced carrier density of ∼1012
cm−2 in a-LAO/LSM/STO, the slope of the conﬁning
potential is consequently much lower resulting in a shal-
lower well compared to other STO-based systems such as
LAO/STO (see Fig. 5c). Remarkably, the multiple par-
allel conducting two-dimensional subbands diﬀerentiates
complex oxides, particularly our modulation-doped oxide
interface, from conventional semiconductor 2-DEGs with
a potential of exploring unusual and exotic physics based
on STO.

the observation of

In summary, we present

the
quantum Hall eﬀect
in two-dimensional conducting
complex oxide interfaces based on the patterned a-
LAO/LSM/STO structure, which reveals that the com-
plex oxide interface consists of a single quantum well with
multiple parallel Ti 3dxy subbands. Importantly, as the
electrons are conﬁned in the STO, the multiple-subband
physical picture is expected to be a common feature of
all STO-based conducting systems. This insight paves
the way for demonstrating new physics in devices based
on complex oxide interfaces.
