Cubic SrTiO3 becomes tetragonal below 105 K. The antiferrodistortive (AFD) distortion leads
to clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of adjacent TiO6 octahedra. This insulator becomes
a metal upon the introduction of extremely low concentration of n-type dopants. However, sig-
natures of the structural phase transition in charge conduction have remained elusive. Employing
the Montgomery technique, we succeed in resolving the anisotropy of charge conductivity induced
by the AFD transition, in the presence of diﬀerent types of dopants. We ﬁnd that the slight lat-
tice distortion (< 6 × 10−4) gives rise to a twenty percent anisotropy in charge conductivity, in
agreement with the expectations of band calculations. Application of uniaxial strain ampliﬁes the
detectable anisotropy by disfavoring one of the three possible tetragonal domains. In contrast with
all other known anisotropic Fermi liquids, the anisotropy has opposite signs for elastic and inelastic
scattering. Increasing the concentration of dopants leads to a drastic shift in the temperature of
the AFD transition either upward or downward. The latter result puts strong constraints on any
hypothetical role played by the AFD soft mode in the formation of Cooper pairs and the emergence
of superconductivity in SrTiO3.

Strontium titanate, of the ABO3 family of perovskites,
has continuously attracted attention during the last ﬁve
decades. As a band insulator, it displays a fascinating va-
riety of fundamental[1, 2] and application-oriented[3, 4]
properties. It is a quantum paraelectric, avoiding a fer-
roelectric transition thanks to quantum ﬂuctuations[5].
With a low-temperature electric permittivity enhanced
by four orders of magnitude, it turns to a metal upon the
introduction of inﬁnitesimal concentration of dopants[6]
or even after shining light[7]. The carriers are remarkably
mobile[8], as a consequence of an exceptionally long Bohr
radius[9] and scatter oﬀ each other generating a resistiv-
ity which varies as T 2, with a very large prefactor[10].
In spite of being far apart, the electrons living in this
peculiar environment can form Cooper pairs in the most
dilute superconductor currently known[11].

In contrast to its isovalent siblings BaTiO3 and
CaTiO3, SrTiO3 is cubic at room temperature. How-
ever, it becomes tetragonal below 105 K. In the ordered
state, TiO6 octahedra rotate in alternating directions
around the c-axis[12–15]. This antiferrodistortive phase
transition has been the subject of a variety of experi-
mental techniques. Clear anomalies in speciﬁc heat[16],
thermal conductivity[17], sound velocity[18] and ther-
mal expansion [19] have been observed at TAFD (cid:39)105
K. The transition does not break inversion symmetry,
but the boundaries between tetragonal domains become
polar[20, 21] deep inside the ordered state.
In spite of
being widely documented over several decades, the con-
sequences of this phase transition for mobile electrons

have been elusive. Indeed, none of the numerous studies
devoted to the transport properties of metallic SrTiO3
have found any anomaly in the vicinity of 105 K either
in electric[6, 8, 10, 22] or thermoelectric[22]transport.

In this paper, we report on a direct measurement of
the in-plane anisotropy of charge conductivity in metallic
SrTiO3 with diﬀerent dopants. Thanks to the sensitivity
of the Montgomery technique[23] employed here for the
ﬁrst time to study SrTiO3, a sharp anomaly at 105 K is
clearly visible. The very slight departure from cubicity
(c/a < 1.0001) gives rise to an anisotropy of conduc-
tivity several orders of magnitude larger (ρc/ρa ∼ 1.1).
First-principles calculations of the Fermi surface in the
AFD state explain the sign of the anisotropy just below
the transition temperature and the order of magnitude of
its amplitude. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that the anisotropy
in conductivity displays a non-monotonous temperature
dependence. Applying uniaxial strain favors two out of
the three possible tetragonal domains and ampliﬁes the
non-monotonous behavior. In contrast to what has been
observed in other Fermi liquids, elastic and inelastic scat-
tering have opposite sign anisotropies. Finally, we report
on the evolution of TAFD with doping, and ﬁnd that dif-
ferent dopants, which give the same superconducting Tc,
aﬀect the AFD transition in diﬀerent ways. We argue
that this provides evidence against a theoretical scenario
tracing the microscopic origin of superconductivity to the
AFD soft phonon mode[24].

The Montgomery technique is a powerful method used
to extract the anisotropy of conductivity in a solid shaped

Like a previous report[25], we found that the magni-
tude of resistivity obtained by this method is in agree-
ment with what is obtained by a standard four-contact
set-up. The advantage of the Montgomery technique is
the direct resolution of the anisotropy, as shown in pan-
els a and b of Fig. 1. It is hard to see any anomaly in
the vicinity of 105 K in either ρx and ρy, but the tem-
perature dependence of their ratio reveals a clear abrupt
jump at the onset of the AFD transition. The ratio is
slightly oﬀ unity (presumably as a result of imperfec-
tions (squareness and contact size) above TAFD (cid:39) 105 K
and suddenly jumps at TAFD. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst detection of a signature of the AFD
transition on charge transport in strontium titanate. The

detect the loss of rotational symmetry and the emergence
of nematicity [26] in other solids including cuprates, iron-
based superconductors or URu2Si2.

Remarkably, multiplicity of domains does not hinder
the observation of the symmetry breaking by a direc-
tional probe such as resistivity. Each of the three axes
of the elementary cubic cell can become the tetragonal
axis (Fig. 1c-f). Therefore, there are three possible do-
mains in an unconstrained crystal and the ρy
ratio is not

the intrinsic anisotropy of SrTiO3−δ.
Its magnitude is
set by the accidental imbalance between the population
of these domains. One would expect therefore that the
magnitude and the orientation of applied strain should
modify the ρy
ratio; as seen in Fig. 2, this is indeed the
ρx
case. Cooling the same sample in the presence of strain,
the anisotropy in the ordered state is enhanced. More-
over, rotating the orientation of the applied strain by 90
degrees in the same sample yields an opposite sign for
− 1) in the AFD state. We conclude that the sam-
( ρy
ρx
ples are multi-domain and applying compressive strain
favors the two domains which have their (longer) c-axis
perpendicular to the strain. As seen in Fig. 2c, strained
SrTi1−xNbxO3 displays also a sizeable anisotropy in its
ρy
ρx

ratio below the transition temperature.
The ﬁrst outcome of this study is a quantiﬁcation of
the magnitude of ρy
ratio. As seen in Fig. 2, in sam-
ρx
ples subject to compressive strain, this ratio can become
as large as 1.2 . At ﬁrst sight, it looks surprising that
an anisotropy of this amplitude in charge conductivity
results from a tetragonal distortion quantiﬁed by x-ray
diﬀraction to be as small as 1.00056[12]. The tetragonal
distortion is linked to the angle of rotation of the TiO6
octahedra[13] :

The measured values of ϕ = 2.1◦[13] and c/a=1.00056
[12] satisfy this expression. As seen in panels d-f of Fig. 1,
the slight tetragonal distortion is accompanied by a more
substantial misalignment between Ti atoms. Consider-
ing that their t2g orbitals host the threefold degenerate
conduction bands of metallic SrTiO3, the consequences
can be drastic. As we will see below, according to ﬁrst-
principles band calculations, the Fermi surface topology
is deeply aﬀected by the phase transition.

A second and more unexpected result is the tempera-
ture dependence of the anisotropy in the ordered state.

then this would suggest a second phase transition well be-

Evolution of the AFD transition temperature with carrier

routes for doping. While Nb (or La) substitution enhances
TAFD, the introduction of oxygen vacancies depresses TAFD.

in SrTiO3 has been a longstanding controversy. However,
the most straightforward explanation for our observation
is provided by considering the possibility that scattering
of electrons by phonons, electrons and crystal defects do
not share the same anisotropy. We will come back to this
below.

We now turn our attention to the evolution of the AFD
transition temperature with doping. As seen in Fig. 3,
the AFD anomaly in ρy
ratio shifts to higher temperature
ρx
with the substitution of Ti with Nb. We also study the
evolution of TAFD with oxygen reduction and La substi-
tution. The emerging picture is summarized in Fig. 3e.
While substituting Ti with Nb (or Sr with La) leads to an
upward shift of TAFD, introducing oxygen vacancies pulls
it downward. The extreme sensitivity of the AFD tran-
sition to the presence of a tiny concentration of foreign
atoms is remarkable. Substituting Sr with larger La or
Ti with larger Nb both strengthen the AFD instability,
presumably by weakening the stability of the cubic struc-
ture, which relies on a fragile balance of the three atomic
radii in SrTiO3.
Intriguingly, this also happens when
Sr is replaced with smaller Ca[27]. In contrast, oxygen
vacancies weaken the tetragonal distortion, presumably
because they destroy the antiferrodistortive coupling be-
tween adjacent octahedra.

The contrasting eﬀect of dopants on TAFD has implica-
tions for the puzzle of superconductivity in this system.
The superconducting Tc has a maximum for carrier den-
sities in the range of n = 1020 cm−3 for all three routes
for n-doping, i.e., oxygen removal, Ti (by Nb)and Sr (by
La) substitution[28, 29]. Decades ago, Appel[24] sug-

gested a link between the formation of Cooper pairs and
the phonon mode associated with the octahedra rotation
and the AFD transition. The drastic diﬀerence in the de-
pendency of TAFD on dopants type indicates that either
the soft mode does not play a major role in superconduc-
tivity or it does not evolve with doping in the same way
as TAFD.

We carried out ﬁrst-principles calculations to quantify
the Fermi surface (FS) anisotropy. Fig. 4 shows the FS
cross sections at EF =1 meV, the electron band struc-
ture, and the anisotropy of the FS as a function of c/a for
chemical potentials (µ) from 1 to 10 meV. According to
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) experiments [11, 33, 34] when
carrier density is n (cid:39)7.8×1017cm−3, the Fermi energy is
close to µ (cid:39) 1 meV. At this level (Fig. 4a), we ﬁnd a FS
area in the (001) plane about 1.7 times larger than in the
(010) plane, in fair agreement with the SdH data[34]. The
calculated band masses (solid lines in Fig. 4b) are lighter
than the experimental values, indicating the importance
of renormalization by electron-phonon interactions and
electron correlation[30, 31]. The estimated renormaliza-
tions are 1.5 for the lower band (similar to explicit calcu-
lations in Ref. [30]) and 3.5 for the upper band. A quan-
titative description of Fermi surface would requires the
calculation of anisotropic mass renormalization. The FS
anisotropy, (ratio of its radii along c and a) reaches 0.65
(Fig. 4c) for µ = 1 meV. The Fermi radius is shorter (and
vF larger) along c, such that the conductivity should be
larger as well. As we will see below this is is in agreement
with the change of anisotropy induced by the structural
transition in the vicinity of TAFD. Finally, according to
the calculations, with increasing µ anisotropy decreases

FIG. 5: a) ρy and ρx as a function of T2 in strained SrTiO3−δ.
The anisotropy of the slope and the intercept are opposit,
which points to a diﬀerent anisotropy for elastic and inelastic
components of resistivity. b) Applying strain along x favors
the two strain domains whose longer c-axis is perpendicular
to x. Since they share a unit vector long the x-axis, they
present only one kind of twin boundary, lying along x and
extending along (0,1,1). Electrons traveling along xx are also
scattered less given the orientation of the twin boundaries.
This leads to a higher residual resistivity. On the other hand,
the average Fermi velocity, set by the anisotropy of the Fermi
surface is larger along the x. This leads to a lower inelastic
resistivity for this orientation.

(see the supplement). This is in agreement with the ex-
perimental observation of diminishing anomaly at TAFD
with increasing doping (Fig. 3a-d).

Let us now examine the puzzle of the non-monotonous
temperature dependence of ρy/ρx. As seen in Fig. 1a,
upon cooling from room temperature to liquid-helium
temperature, the resistivity of metallic SrTiO3 drops by
three orders of magnitude. Thus, inelastic scattering of
electrons is by far the dominant scattering at the AFD
transition around 100 K. Most of this inelastic scattering
is due to phonons, but below 30 K, the electron-electron
scattering leads to a quadratic temperature dependence.
Fig. 5 shows the low-temperature resistivity of a strained
oxygen-reduced sample as a function of T 2. In agreement

a behavior described by ρi = ρ0i + AiT 2 (i=x,y). Re-
markably, the intercept (ρ0) is lower along the direction
where the prefactor A is larger. In other words, elastic
scattering is larger along the orientation for which inelas-
tic scattering is smaller. This generates a peak in ρy
(T ),

since the balance between the two components of the re-
sistivity is changed at an intermediate temperature.

from other
anisotropic Fermi
In the
latter cases, the residual resistivity and the prefactor of
the T 2 resistivity share the same anisotropy, set by the
Fermi velocity anisotropy. The same is true of two other
well-known perovskites, the ruthenate superconductor
Sr2RuO4[37] and La1.7Sr0.3CuO4[38].
In both of these
layered conductors, the prefactor of the quadratic term
in the resistivity and the residual resistivity share the
same anisotropy.

The exceptional case of metallic SrTiO3−δ may be a re-
sult of the particular orientation of boundaries between
twins in a sample subject to uniaxial strain (see Fig.
5b). Application of strain along one direction leads to
the suppression of one domain out of three (the one with
its c-axis along the strain). Since the Fermi velocity is
larger along the c-axis, the conductivity should become
lower in the orientation parallel to the applied strain.
This is indeed what is seen experimentally. On the other
hand, in such a conﬁguration the favored domain bound-
ary would lie along the orientation of compressive strain.
As a scatterer, such a boundary would introduce addi-
tional scattering perpendicular to the direction of strain.
This could explain the opposite signs of (ρy − ρx)/ρx at
the onset of the transition (governed by the anisotropy
of the Fermi velocity) and in the zero temperature limit

(set by the orientation of twin boundaries).

Two other features should also be included in an ex-
haustive quantitative treatment of the problem. The ﬁrst
is the experimental evidence for enhanced conductivity
along a twin boundary in SrTiO3[39]. This would am-
plify further the anisotropy introduced by the presence
of a twin boundary along the orientation of compressive
strain. The second is the contrast between the structure
of a potential well introduced by an (isotropic) Nb dopant
and an oxygen vacancy, which would be an intrinsically
anisotropic scattering center.

Several other questions remain. The precise shape of
the Fermi surface in dilute metallic SrTiO3 is not set-
tled yet. A detailed angle-dependent study on single-
domain samples is necessary to map the full FS. The
quantiﬁcation of the non-parabolic dispersion is impor-
tant to pin down the origin of the T 2 resistivity in the
dilute limit[10]. Non-parabolicity leads to a distinction
between momentum and velocity, and breaks Galilean
invariance[40], which is expected to play a signiﬁcant role
in the T 2 resistivity of SrTiO3.

In summary, we quantify the anisotropy of charge
conductivity caused by the AFD transition in metallic
SrTiO3, using the Montgomery technique. Both ﬁrst-
principles band calculations and experimental data ﬁnd
that the very slight departure from cubicity gives rise to
a sizeable anisotropy in the Fermi surface and conduc-
tivity. In contrast with other anisotropic Fermi liquids,
elastic and inelastic resistivity do not present the same
anisotropy. The contrasting response of the AFD and
superconducting phase transitions to the type of dopant
argues against any role played by the octahedral rota-
tional mode in superconductivity.

Appendix A: Experimental details

Oxygen vacancies were introduced in commercial sin-
gle crystals of SrTiO3 by heating them in the tempera-
ture range of 800 to 1100 degrees Celsius in a vacuum in
the range of 10−7 mbar in a manner reported before [S1].
The samples’ typical dimensions were 10×10×0.5mm3 or
5× 5× 0.5mm3. Ohmic contacts on sample corners were
made by evaporating gold and heating up to 600 degrees.
Compressive uniaxial stress was applied by sandwich-
ing the sample between two metallic blocks connected
with two stainless steel screws. The magnitude of ap-
plied strain was measured using a common 350Ω resistive
strain gage (Kyowa KFL-1-350-C1-11).

Appendix B: Computational details

√

2 × √

A 20-atom cell (

2 × 2) is adopted to calculate
the Fermi surfaces and band structures of the tetragonal
AFD phase of SrTiO3, while a 5-atom unit cell is used for
the cubic phase. To study the eﬀect of c/a ratio, the in-
plane lattice constant is ﬁxed to an experimental value at
50 K, i.e., 5.507 ˚A[S2], while c/a varies from 1 to 1.0006.
The AFD tilting angle for each c/a is ﬁxed according to
Equation (3) of the Main Article. The calculations are
carried out within the framework of density function the-
ory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA), us-
ing the abinit package. [S3, S4]. The wave functions are
expanded using plane-wave basis sets with kinetic energy
cutoﬀ of 45 Hartree. The self-consistent calculations are
performed on an unshifted 6×6×4 and 12×12×12 k-point
grid for the tetragonal and cubic phases, respectively.

The accurate Fermi surface anisotropy (Fig. 4c of the
Article) is determined from the band structures along
the pseudo-cubic [100] and [001] directions (Fig.
4b

of the Article), by ﬁnding k for which the band in-
tersects the chemical potential. Optimized norm con-
serving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials are used here[S5], in
order to include the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which
yields a band edge splitting (due to tetragonal distor-
tion) that is in good agreement with experiment [S6].
This agreement is somewhat fortuitous, given the neglect
of electron-electron interactions beyond semilocal DFT
and of electron-phonon interaction eﬀects, as already ob-
served by Allen[S6] and van Mechelen[S7]. Both eﬀects
will increase the eﬀective mass, and may contribute to
shift the AFD splitting. Larger values of splitting were
found with LAPW[S8], which should be more accurate
DFT as it does not pseudize the wave functions. Using
the experimental values for lattice constant and AFD
angles removes the additional eﬀect of DFT structural
relaxation. The Fermi surface shape (Fig. 4a) is ob-
tained with explicit calculations including 200×200×200
k points in a restricted cube of ±0.05π/a in each direc-
tion around Γ.

For the graphical representation of the Fermi sur-
face evolution as a function of the chemical potential
and AFD angle, non-relativistic extended norm conserv-
ing pseudopotentials are adopted [S8]. The Fermi sur-
faces of the lowest conduction band are obtained with
200×200×200 k grid in the full Brillouin Zone, using
maximally-localised Wannier functions and the Wan-
nier90 code[S10]. Without the SOC the FS are not
quantitative, but qualitatively show the evolution of the
shape and anisotropy. In agreement with previous theo-
retical studies[S8], we ﬁnd that the cubic phase FS has
six lobes at moderate to high doping. In the tetragonal
state, two out of these six are squeezed (Fig. 6). When
the chemical potential (µ) is near the band edge, the
FS shape is in agreement with the model bands given in
Ref.[S7].
