Abstract

A novel idea to control ion back-ﬂow in time projection chambers is to use a multi-
layer extended gating grid to capture back-ﬂowing ions at the expense of live time and
electron transparency.
In this initial study, I perform simulations of a four-layer grid
for the ALICE and STAR time projection chambers, using Ne − CO2 (90 − 10) and
Ar − CH4 (90 − 10) gas mixtures, respectively.
I report the live time and electron
transparency for both 90% and 99% ion back-ﬂow suppression. Additionally, for the
ALICE conﬁguration I study several eﬀects: using a mesh vs. wire-plane grid, including
a magnetic ﬁeld, and varying the over-voltage distribution in the gating region. For 90%
ion back-ﬂow suppression, I achieve 75% live time with 86% electron transparency for
ALICE, and 95% live time with 83% electron transparency for STAR.

1. Introduction

In high-rate gaseous time projection chambers (TPCs), ion back-ﬂow (IBF) from the
gas ampliﬁcation region to the drift volume distorts the drift ﬁeld, deteriorating tracking
and PID performance. A recent proposal to control IBF in TPCs is to use a multi-layer
extended gating grid [1]. In comparison to a traditional gating grid, the extension of
the grid with multiple layers allows a longer time for ions to drift through the gate,
while still collecting the ions quickly. The operating principle is that the gate remains
transparent to electrons until the ion drift time exceeds the grid length (divided by the
ion drift velocity), at which point the gate is closed and the ions are collected. Enhanced
IBF suppression comes at the sacriﬁce of live time and electron transparency; for a given
IBF tolerance, the design goal is to increase the live time fraction A while maintaining
suﬃcient electron transparency for reconstruction performance. Such a design could
operate as a primary means of IBF suppression, or in cooperation with other elements
such as Gas Electron Multipliers. Early work suggests that for a wire-plane gate, low-
ﬁeld regions between the wires prevent some ions from being captured quickly [1]. The
detailed simulations presented below quantify this eﬀect and serve as an initial study of
the general feasibility of a multi-layer extended gating grid.

2. Simulation Conﬁgurations

In order to study the performance of the grid in various TPC conditions, I simulate
the gating region for two large gas TPCs: ALICE [2] and STAR [3]. These TPCs use
diﬀerent gas mixtures (with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ion mobilities) and diﬀerent drift ﬁelds,
which considerably impact the gating performance.

In both TPC conﬁgurations, I consider a four-layer grid (Fig. 1), with the open ﬁeld
Eo parallel/anti-parallel to the closed ﬁeld Ec. The spacing between layers is 3 mm, and
the inter-layer wire spacing is 2 mm. I use a 3 mm drift volume above the grid, and a
grounded plane 3 mm below the grid. The wire diameter is 100 µm. The ions are collected
on the ﬁrst and third planes from the gas ampliﬁcation region, with Ec ≈ 2 kV/cm.

The ﬁelds are constructed using the ﬁnite element method software ANSYS [4]; the
electron and ion drifts are simulated using Garﬁeld++ [5]. Collision-level tracking is
performed for electrons (“microscopic tracking”), and a more coarse-grained Monte Carlo
tracking is used for ions. Diﬀusion is included for both electrons and ions. It should be
noted that while Garﬁeld++ can natively solve 2D ﬁelds, close examination revealed that
the ANSYS solution is more accurate near the wires.

Figure 1: Schematics of the open (left) and closed (right) gating conﬁgurations. In the open conﬁguration,
electrons pass through with small losses, while positive ions back-drift through the gate. In the closed
conﬁguration, these back-drifted positive ions are collected on the ﬁrst and third planes by Ec.

2.1. ALICE TPC

For the ALICE TPC, I use a gas mixture of Ne−CO2 (90−10), as conﬁgured for LHC
Run 1. The drift ﬁeld is ≈ 0.4 kV/cm; a representative voltage switch required on the four
gating planes (in volts) is: (−600, 0,−600, 0) ↔ (−120,−240,−360,−480). The electron
drift velocity in this mixture for the considered drift ﬁeld is 2.73 cm/µs [6]. Binary ion
mobilities from the literature are linearly extrapolated to low ﬁelds and combined for the
gas mixture using Blanc’s Law [7][8][9]. The dominant ion in this mixture is CO+
2 [10].
To study diﬀerences in ion collection time and electron transparency, I study sepa-
rately a wire conﬁguration and a mesh conﬁguration (Fig. 2). The ﬁnal ﬁnite element
meshes contain approximately 3 · 105 elements for the wire conﬁguration unit cell, and
2 · 106 elements for the mesh conﬁguration unit cell. These correspond to an average
element size of 56 µm for the wire conﬁguration, and 33 µm for the mesh conﬁguration.

However, adaptive meshing is employed, which creates ﬁner elements near geometrical
features. The ﬁnal meshes were examined for quality, and an informal convergence study
was performed, in which iteratively reﬁned meshes were produced, and the maximum
ﬁeld near the wires showed convergence to < 10%.

2.2. STAR TPC

For the STAR TPC, I use a gas mixture of Ar − CH4 (90 − 10). The drift ﬁeld is
approximately 140 V/cm. The electron drift velocity in this mixture for the considered
drift ﬁeld is 5.45 cm/µs, and the ion mobility 1.6 cm2/V · s.

3.1. Electron Transparency

I measure electron transparency by randomly placing electrons at the top of the drift
region, and measuring the fraction that pass through the grid in the open conﬁguration.
At each layer in the grid, I increment the ﬁeld by a value ∆E in order to boost the trans-
parency; increasing ∆E amounts to putting negative charge on the wires, which repels
drifting electrons. I use ﬁxed over-voltages corresponding to ∆E = 0, 10, 20, 30 V/cm
across each plane, yielding average open gating ﬁelds of Eo = 400, 425, 450, 475 V/cm.
Figure 3 shows the results for both the wire-plane and mesh conﬁgurations.

Additionally, I repeated electron transparency measurement in the mesh conﬁguration
with a magnetic ﬁeld B = 0.5 T parallel to the electric ﬁeld. This results in a slight

increase in transparency (Fig. 3), which may be due to reduced transverse diﬀusion (from
the B-ﬁeld) outweighing E × B eﬀects (which may deviate drifting electrons from the
electric ﬁeld lines into a wire); the cause remains to be investigated.

Next, I examined the over-voltage distribution to determine if there is an optimal
way to distribute ∆E over diﬀerent planes, rather than ﬁxing it to be constant across
each layer. A comparison of ﬁxed ∆E over each plane against having nonzero ∆E only
across the ﬁrst plane shows little diﬀerence (Fig. 4). In the latter case, fewer electrons
are captured on the ﬁrst layer, but more are captured in subsequent layers. This suggests
that if more layers are added to the grid, the ﬁxed ∆E conﬁguration is better.

The factor α in the collection time accounts for the fact that the ﬁeld is not from

To estimate the live time of the simulated conﬁguration, the parameter α must be
measured in simulation, or equivalently Tc. I measure the ion collection time by randomly
(uniformly) placing ions in the gating region, as one would expect for backdrifting ions,
and counting the time it takes to collect the ions in the closed conﬁguration. Figure 5
shows the results.
≈ 31 µs exists for both cases (as
expected from a parallel plate solution), while the wire conﬁguration has a signiﬁcantly
longer tail, due to more low-ﬁeld regions.

Additionally, I introduced a magnetic ﬁeld B = 0.5 T in the mesh conﬁguration, and
repeated the ion collection. This causes no change in collection times, as expected since
the magnetic force on ions is negligible due to their slow drift velocities (and additionally,
the magnetic ﬁeld would perturb ion trajectories not only into the low-ﬁeld regions, but
out of them as well).

3.2.2. Live Time Estimates

The measured collection times, in conjunction with the above table of parameters,
yield the following live times, reported for 90% and 99% IBF, and for transparencies
corresponding to ∆E = 0, 20 V/cm, for both the wire-plane and mesh conﬁgurations:

I take Eo = 190 V/cm, corresponding to a 140 V/cm drift ﬁeld plus 20 V/cm per
plane overvoltage. I then measure the electron transparency with this overvoltage via
simulation of 25,000 electrons in the wire-plane conﬁguration to be:

The statistical error is ≈ (cid:112)np(1 − p)/n ≈ 0.2%, but the dominant uncertainty is ex-

82.6%.

pected to come from the ﬁeld map or one of many other possible sources of error, which
haven’t been quantiﬁed. The transparency could be boosted at the expense of live time
by increasing the average gate ﬁeld Eo. Also, small improvements ∼ 1% were observed
in ALICE simulations when a magnetic ﬁeld was included, although this was not done
here (the electrons in STAR are hotter than in ALICE, so the diﬀusion and E × B eﬀects
are both probably larger, and one would need to verify the outcome of their balance).

I measure the parameter α by simulating the ion collection time for 90% and 99% of
backdrifting ions (Fig. 6). Recall that α = 2 means that the closed time is equal to twice
that of a perfect parallel plate. I ﬁnd

The live time for this set of parameters, with 82.6% electron transparency, is then:

α90% = 1.6,

α99% = 2.9.

A90% = 95%,

A99% = 93%.

Relative to ALICE, the smaller drift ﬁeld and the smaller ion mobility allow the open
gate to be open longer (since ions drift back more slowly), and additionally the larger
electron drift velocity reduces the electron drift time per cycle Te. Note also that in this
scheme, the detector could operate continuously for up to To ∼ 4 ms before the gate
needs to be closed.

5. Discussion

The results above provide an early quantitative look at possible modiﬁed gating grid
conﬁgurations. The speciﬁc results for live time and electron transparency should not

99% IBF thresholds are illustrated.

be viewed as expected limits, but rather starting points from which optimization could
begin.

One concrete conclusion, however, is that the mesh grid appears untenable. The idea
of the mesh conﬁguration is to increase the live time A by decreasing Tc, at the expense
of transparency. However, the simulations suggest that the transparency cost is large
for only a small improvement in live time. Further, it should be noted that the wire
conﬁguration has an additional advantage in that it preserves momentum information
along the direction of the wires, whereas the mesh distorts momentum information in
both directions. If one is determined to reduce Tc, an additional avenue to pursue is a
dynamically switched gating cycle, in which the saddle point ions are swept out of the
low-ﬁeld region. This could be accomplished by the closed time consisting of two periods
of Ec (cid:107) Eo interspersed with a period of Ec ⊥ Eo.

A handful of additional parameters directly exhibit a tradeoﬀ between live time and
electron transparency: N, ∆h, and Eo. The idea in designing a detector is to favor those
variables that give maximal live time boost with minimal transparency loss.

If electron transparency is a concern, one should increase Eo as much as possible.
To boost the live time, equation (1) suggests it is better to try to increase To rather
than decrease Tc. Further study of varying N, ∆h, and Eo should be undertaken. For
example, in the ALICE conﬁguration, plots of the ﬁnal positions of electrons show that

This extra layer will cause To → 5
4 To, yielding live time improvements of approximately
5%. Adding yet another layer would have an even smaller eﬀect on transparency, and
yield a further boost in live time. Similar arguments can be made for increasing ∆h,
at the expense of longer collection time, perhaps worse transparency, and larger voltage
switches. This option may be particularly attractive for situations in which 90% IBF
suppression is acceptable. The possibility of signiﬁcantly increasing Eo in concert with
these approaches may be particularly appealing, and should be tested.

To estimate the live time for conﬁgurations other than ALICE or STAR, one can use
equation (1), upon choosing an α comparable to those for the ALICE and STAR results
(for a given IBF suppression). Electron transparency estimates are more diﬃcult, and
require detailed simulation.

6. Conclusions

The presented simulations suggest that a multi-layer extended gating grid may be a
feasible option for reducing IBF in TPCs, depending on acceptable losses of live time and
electron transparency, and the TPC conﬁguration. There remains signiﬁcant room for
optimization, and it is expected that results will continue to improve as they are adapted
for particular applications. Experimental tests are also being pursued.
