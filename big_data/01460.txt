Abstract

The master equation for the reversible reaction A + A ⇀↽ 0 is considered in Poisson representation,
where it is equivalent to a Langevin equation with imaginary noise for a complex stochastic variable
φ. Such Langevin equations appear quite generally in ﬁeld-theoretic treatments of reaction–diﬀusion
problems. For this example we study the probability ﬂow in the complex φ plane both analytically
and by simulation. We show that this ﬂow has various curious features that must be expected to occur
similarly in other Langevin equations associated with reaction–diﬀusion problems.

1 Introduction

Let there be a reacting chemical system with diﬀusing species A, B, . . . By a “chemical” master equation
is meant one which governs the time evolution of the probability distribution of the particle numbers of
these species. Under certain conditions such an equation is equivalent, via a “Poisson representation,” to
a Langevin equation with imaginary noise for space and time dependent ﬁelds φA(x, t), φB(x, t), . . . This
equivalence was ﬁrst shown by Gardiner and coworkers (see [1]) and has reappeared [2] in ﬁeld-theoretic
treatments of reaction–diﬀusion problems as an outcome of the second-quantized formalism. Imaginary
noise is typically (although not only) due to reaction processes whose reactants include two or more
particles of the same species; it is a mathematical tool that helps in an elegant way to keep track of
evolving probability distributions.

It is of interest to investigate such imaginary noise Langevin equations more closely. The motivation
comes, for one part, from the intrinsic interest of a relatively unexplored type of equation, and for an-
other part, from the hope that perhaps Monte Carlo simulation of a reaction–diﬀusion system in this new
representation could turn out to be eﬃcient. This latter idea is reinforced by the fact that the stochas-
tic diﬀusive motion of the reacting particles becomes deterministic in the Poisson representation: The
Langevin noise is exclusively due to the reaction processes.

One may therefore learn about imaginary noise even in the absence of diﬀusion.

In this note we
present a case study in which, for simplicity and in order to fully control all aspects of the problem, we
will disregard diﬀusion except for a brief mention at the end. We will examine the single-species reversible
reaction process

A + A ⇀↽ 0

(1)

where the symbol “0” may represent an inert species. Its only parameter is the ratio λ of the forward
(0 → 2A) to backward (2A → 0) reaction rates.
Several questions of interest may be investigated on this example. In general, reactions may or may
not conserve the parity of the total particle number, with ensuing consequences for the critical behavior
of a system (for an enlightening recent discussion see [3]). Hence one natural and nontrivial question here
is how the parity conservaton of reaction (1) is reﬂected in the properties of the imaginary noise Langevin
equation.

In its usual particle number representation the reaction (1) is of course fully understood and trivial.
However, the corresponding Langevin equation, which is a stochastic ODE for a single function (“ﬁeld”)
φ(t), has many curious features. These will be the focus of our interest here. We will see that not all of
these features necessarily have their counterparts in physical properties, and will try to identify the role
of each.

We mention some related work. The usual interest in the literature has been in the case λ = 0 (only
particle annihilation) in the presence of diﬀusion (see e.g. Lee [4] and references therein); the main object
of study then is the exponent of the power law decay to the zero density state. The two coupled Langevin
equations for the reaction A + A ⇀↽ C and A + B ⇀↽ C with diﬀusion were studied in detail by Rey
and Cardy [5]. They are interested in how the C particle densities approaches its equilibrium values
for large times. Howard and T¨auber [6] study various reaction–diﬀusion systems involving the process
A + A → 0 and subject to both imaginary and real noise, the latter being due to coupling to one or more
other reaction processes. They are led to conclude that even in the presence of additional real noise the
imaginary noise cannot be neglected.

In Sec. 2 we present the master equation and equivalent Langevin equation for the process (1).

In
Secs. 3-6 we address successively various aspects of the motion in the complex plane. In Secs. 7 and 8 we
consider the limiting cases λ → ∞ and λ → 0, respectively. In Sec. 9 we investigate the possibility of
alternative ways of simulating reaction–diﬀusion problems. We point out several diﬃculties and questions
associated with simulating the time evolution of the Poisson variable φ. Some of the eﬀects of an additional
diﬀusion term are also brieﬂy discussed.

2 Langevin equation with imaginary noise

For the process (1) the probability P (n, t) of having n particles A at time t obeys the master equation

dP (n, t)

dt

= 1

2 (n + 1)(n + 2)P (n + 2, t) − 1
+ λhP (n − 2, t) − P (n, t)i

2 n(n − 1)P (n, t)

(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .)

(2)

with the convention P (−2, t) = P (−1, t) = 0. Following Gardiner [1] one writes for P (n, t) the Poisson
representation

P (n, t) = Z dxZ dy F (x, y, t) px+iy(n)

(3)

in which pφ(n) = φne−φ/n! is the Poisson distribution of parameter φ. It is a true probability only for
real positive φ and a “quasi-probability” for arbitrary complex φ = x + iy. For any P (n, t) there exists a
nonunique F (x, y, t) such that (3) holds; one may impose the additional requirement that F be real and

nonnegative, but even so it is nonunique. In any case it is normalized such that RdxRdy F (x, y, t) = 1.

The equivalence between the Poisson representation method [1] and the second quantized formalism
[7, 8, 9] was ﬁrst pointed out by Droz and McKane [10], who however avoid discussing Langevin equations.
By either approach one shows that P (n, t) deﬁned by (3) satisﬁes the master equation (2) if F (x, y, t) is
the probablity density of a variable φ = x + iy obeying the Langevin equation

dφ
dt

= 2λ − φ2 + p2λ − φ2 ζ(t)

[ I ]

(4)

Here ζ(t) is Gaussian white noise of autocorrelation hζ(t)ζ(t′)i = δ(t − t′) and [ I ] indicates the Itˆo
interpretation [1, 11, 13]. Equation (4) is the subject of the present study. It derives it interest from the
fact that the noise term is complex whenever φ is outside the real interval [−√2λ,√2λ].

The ﬁeld-theoretical approach of Ref. [2] deals with the case λ = 0 and the noise term in the Langevin

equation there appears as ξ(t) = iφ(t)ζ(t). Hence ξ(t) is Gaussian white noise with

hξ(t)ξ(t′)i = −φ2δ(t − t′)

(5)

Because of the minus sign on the RHS of (5) and perhaps because of the suggestive factor −φ2, the noise
is usually referred to as “imaginary.” Of course the noise term as well as the other terms in the Langevin
equation (4) are generically complex.

The time dependent averages calculated from the master equation (2) are related to those found from

the Langevin equation (4) by [1]

hφki = hn(n − 1) . . . (n − k + 1)i

(k = 0, 1, 2, . . .)

(6)

Fokker-Planck equation.

where the average on the LHS is with respect to F and that on the RHS with respect to P . Although the
average of primary interest, hni, is equal to hφi, it needs to be stressed [2, 6] that φ is not itself a physical
variable.
The Langevin equation (4), separated into its real and imaginary parts,
is equivalent [1, 11] to a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for the probability density F (x, y, t). We will
occasionally refer to this FP equation, but do not need its explicit general form. Let us consider, however,

the special case of an initial value φ(0) in the interval [−√2λ,√2λ]. Equation (4) shows that then φ(t)

remains conﬁned to this section of the real axis at all t > 0. Upon denoting the time dependent probability
density of φ = x + iy on this interval by F1(x, t) we get from (4) the equivalent FP equation

∂F1(x, t)

(7)

which will be referred to in Secs. 6 and 7.

3 Parity conservation

The master equation (2) leaves the subspaces of even and odd n invariant, so that P ≡ h(−1)ni is a
constant of the motion. Upon evaluating this average by inserting for P its Poisson representation (3) one
ﬁnds that

(8)
which shows that he−2φi is the corresponding constant of the motion in φ language. Within the second
quantized formalism one may arrive at the same relation (8) at the cost of a somewhat greater algebraic
eﬀort [12].

h(−1)ni = he−2φi

It is of interest to show explicitly, starting from the Langevin equation (4), that he−2φi is conserved.
One may do so by transforming this equation to the new variable α = e−2φ. We recall that the Langevin-
Itˆo equation dφ/dt = G(φ) + H(φ)ζ(t) is equivalent to the Langevin-Stratonovich equation dφ/dt =
G(φ)− 1
2 H(φ)dH/dφ + H(φ)ζ(t), and that in the latter the unknown may be nonlinearly transformed
according to the usual rules of algebra [1, 11]. Hence the Stratonovich ([ S ]) version of (4) is

dφ
dt

= 2λ − φ(φ − 1

2 ) + p2λ − φ2 ζ(t)

[ S ]

which, transformed to an equation for α and reconverted to Itˆo interpretation, yields

d
dt

e−2φ = 2e−2φp2λ − φ2 ζ(t)

[ I ]

(9)

(10)

In the Itˆo interpretation the noise ζ(t) is independent of φ(t) and so upon averaging (10) over ζ(t) the
RHS vanishes, after which an average with respect to F (x, y, t) yields the parity conservation law.

4 Time evolution: General properties

We ﬁrst comment on some general properties of the Langevin equation (4). These may be analyzed in
terms of two sets of curves in the complex plane, exhibited in Fig. 1 for the particular parameter value
λ = 3.

Diﬀusion curves.

In any point of the complex plane the diﬀusive displacement (i.e. the displacement
due to the noise term in (4)) is along a single direction. This means that the diﬀusion tensor in the
equivalent FP equation for F (x, y, t) has one zero eigenvalue, and therefore this FP equation is not generic.
The zero eigenvalue becomes explicit in an appropriate set of coordinates, as we will show now.

Upon dividing (9) by p2λ − φ2 one ﬁnds
φ
√2λ

arcsin

d
dt

=

2λ − φ(φ − 1
2 )
p2λ − φ2

Then setting arcsin(φ/√2λ) ≡ Q(x, y)− iR(x, y) and taking real and imaginary parts of (11) one gets an
expression for dQ/dt which contains the noise ζ(t) and one for dR/dt which shows that R is unaﬀected
by the noise. The diﬀusion therefore operates only along curves R(x, y) = C, where C is a constant. From
the explicit expression of R(x, y) one ﬁnds that this collection of “diﬀusion curves” is given by

+ ζ(t)

(11)

1 −p1 − 2λ/φ2
1 +p1 − 2λ/φ2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= e−2C

(C ≥ 0)

(12)

The curves, shown in Fig. 1, are symmetric under reﬂection with respect to the x and y axis. They
√2λ,√2λ]; there is
constitute a nested collection of closed contours that go around the real interval [−
one such contour through each point of the complex plane. The degenerate contour C = 0 coincides with
[−

√2λ,√2λ].

trajectories all originate in a single point φ− and terminate in a single point φ+, both on the x axis (see

Drift trajectories. A second collection of curves is determined by the solutions of the drift equations,
i.e. of (11) [or equivalently (9)] with ζ set equal to zero. We will refer to these curves as the “drift
trajectories.” They may be parametrized by an integration constant D and the sign of y, and are explicitly
given by

(13)

16 (1 + 32λ) + D|y|
They are symmetric under reﬂection with respect to x = 1
4 and y = 0. For all D they have the same pair
of end points φ± = 1
4 (1 ± p1 + 32λ) which are ﬁxed points of the drift equations. Time increases from
φ− to φ+ There is one drift trajectory through each point of the complex plane.
Existence of solution. The drift trajectory consisting of the half-axis (−∞, φ−) is exceptional: any
initial point x0 on this half-axis arrives at x = −∞ in a ﬁnite “blowup” time t0, after which the solution
of the drift equations ceases to exist. It is therefore necessary to ask if the solution of the full Langevin
equation (4) exists for all times. The same question applies to the equivalent FP equation (with, say, an
initial value F (x, y, 0) nonzero only in a ﬁnite domain). We consider proving the existence of F (x, y, t) (and
of averages such as hφi and he−2φi) beyond the blowup time as a diﬃcult open problem. The physicist’s
“proof” consists of remarking that the trajectory φ(t) = x(t) + iy(t) generated by the Langevin equation
never ends, but it ignores the fact that the diﬀusion constant associated with this trajectory may become
arbitrarily large. In any case, a possible singularity that would appear at the blowup time would certainly
not represent a physical eﬀect, but only be a property of the particular Poisson representation. We return
brieﬂy to these questions in Sec. 8 when considering the special case λ = 0.

5 Equilibrium

It is easy to verify that the master equation (2) has two independent equilibrium solutions, viz.Poissonians
of parameter √2λ of which one is restricted to the even and the other to the odd nonnegative integers.
By superposing these solutions one may write an arbitrary equilibrium solution P eq(n) as

P eq(n) = A p√2λ(n) + B p

−

√2λ (n)

The coeﬃcients A and B are determined by the constant of the motion P according to

A =

e2√2λ − P
2 sinh 2√2λ

B = −e−2√2λ + P
2 sinh 2√2λ

(14)

(15)

(16)

so that A + B = 1 as required by normalization. An obvious way to Poisson represent the equilibrium
solution (14) is

F eq(x, y) = δ(y)F eq

1 (x)

with

(17)
Two limiting cases merit special consideration. For λ → ∞ the coeﬃcient B vanishes exponentially and
√2λ). The limit λ → 0 is singular (the two delta peaks in
the equilibrium solution (17) approaches δ(x −
Eq. (17) coalesce) and requires separate analysis. In the n representation one has in this limit

F eq
1 (x) = A δ(x −

√2λ) + B δ(x + √2λ)

P eq(n) = 1

2 (1 + P) δn0 + 1

2 (1 − P) δn1

(18)

in agreement with the fact that for λ = 0 there remains 0 or 1 particle, depending on the initial state.
One possible Poisson representation of (18) is

F eq
1 (x) = 1

2 (1 + P) δ(x) − 1

2 (1 − P)

d
dx

δ(x)

(19)

as is easily veriﬁed by substitution in Eq. (3). The second term in Eq. (19) is no longer nonnegative,
and hence in this case F eq
is actually a quasi-probability distribution. We emphasize that the Poisson
1
representations exhibited here are by no means unique. Below we will see how other representations of
the equilibrium distributions arise.

6 Approach of equilibrium

The approach of equilibrium in the n representation is very unsurprising. For t → ∞ the distribution
P (n, t) will tend to an equilibrium P eq(n) uniquely determined by the initial value of P and given by
(14)–(15).
We will now consider the approach to equilibrium in the φ representation for an initial state φ(0) = ρ,
i.e. for an initial Poisson distribution P (n, 0) = pρ(n). The constant of the motion then has the value
h(−1)ni = e−2ρ. We are led to distinguish two cases.
Real solutions. Let us ﬁrst suppose that the initial value ρ is in the interval [−√2λ,√2λ]. In this case
the time dependent probability distribution F (x, t) of φ on this interval is described by the equivalent FP
equation (7) For λ > 0 the two boundary points are “adhesive” (in the terminology of Ref. [13]). For t → ∞
the solution tends to the equilibrium distribution F eq(x) given by (17) and (15) with h(−1)ni = e−2ρ.
Note that when ρ is in the interval under consideration, we have A, B ≥ 0.
Complex solutions. Let now ρ be real but outside [−√2λ,√2λ] (only ρ > √2λ is physical). The
Langevin equation (4) then generates a stochastic trajectory φ(t) in the complex plane. The time evolution
is equivalently described in this case by an FP equation for the bivariate probability distribution F (x, y, t)
with initial condition F (x, y, 0) = δ(y)δ(x − ρ). Since in this case either A or B is negative, the –
necessarily nonnegative – solution F (x, y, t) cannot for t → ∞ tend to the double delta peak given by

6

(16)–(17). Hence something else must happen. In fact, for t → ∞ the distribution F (x, y, t) tends to a
stationary distribution F eq that has its support in the complex plane. To obtain this distribution, we have
let a set (a “cloud”) of 10 000 points, initially all concentrated in φ = 1, evolve independently in time, until
their spatial distribution had reached (or, at least, closely approached) a stationary state, that we identify
with F eq. The resulting ﬁnal cloud is shown in Fig. 2 for the special cases λ = 0 and λ → ∞, where for
the latter we have shifted the origin according to x = √2λ + u. The distributions F eq for 0 < λ < ∞
interpolate smoothly between these two limiting cases. They are Poisson representations of (14) distinct
from (17). To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst time that such equilibrium distributions in the complex plane
have been explicitly determined numerically. Because of the initial condition the distributions shown here
are characterized by the constants of the motion he−2φi = e−2 and he−2χi = e−2. However, diﬀerent values
of the constants of the motion yield almost identical (i.e. visually indistinguishable) distributions; this is
because the value of the constant of the motion may be changed arbitrarily by a slight redistribution of
the probability density faraway in the left half plane.

7 Limit λ → ∞
We set φ = √2λ + χ with χ = √2λ + u + iy and scale time according to τ = √2λ t. The limit λ → ∞ of

(4) then exists and χ satisﬁes the Langevin equation

[ I ]

(20)

where hζ(τ )ζ(τ′)i = δ(τ − τ′). This equation conserves the average he−2χi. It is interesting to remark that
in this limit the drift equation has become linear so that the problem of blowup in ﬁnite time, discussed
in Sec. 4, has disappeared. Below we will continue to use the symbols F1 and F for probability densities
on the u axis and in the uy plane, respectively.

Real solutions. When χ is real and negative, we merely have a limiting case of the real problem
discussed in Sec. 6, but with the advantage that F1(u, t) may be found exactly for arbitrary initial condition

u0. After obtaining and solving an equation for the Fourier transform of F1 one ﬁnds that F1(u, t) =
exp( 2u0
e2t−1 )δ(u) + Fcont(u, t). Here Fcont(u, t) is an explicitly known continuous density on the negative u
axis which tends to zero with time for all u, while evolving in such a manner that he−2χi remains constant.
A similar example of such a solution was worked out in detail in Ref. [13], ch. XII.5.
Complex solutions. Any distribution F not initially conﬁned to the negative u axis spreads out into
It is then of advantage to transform to the new coordinates R = Re√4χ and
Q = Im√4χ, where R ≥ 0 and −∞ < Q < ∞. Up to inessential coeﬃcients these variables are equal to
the λ → ∞ limits of, respectively, R and Q deﬁned in Sec. 4. In terms of R and Q the Langevin equation
(20) reads

which shows that diﬀusion takes place only parallel to the Q axis. The lines R = E, where E is a constant,
correspond to the set of parabolas u = −y2/E2 + 1
4 E2 in the uy plane. In spite of this simpliﬁcation we are
not in this case able to explicitly ﬁnd the stationary density F eq(u, y), let alone a time dependent solution
F (u, y, t). Nevertheless, one sees directly from (21) that dR/dτ < 0 outside the circle Q2 + R2 = 1.
Therefore the probability ﬂow across the line R = 1 can only be towards the left and the stationary
probability density F eq(u, y) must be identically zero for R > 1, i.e. for u + y2 > 1
4 .

8 Limit λ → 0
For λ → 0 the interval [−
λ = 0 we may set φ = reiψ and rewrite the Langevin equation (4) in terms of the polar coordinates,

√2λ,√2λ] on which there exists a real solution, contracts to the origin. When

dr
dt

dψ
dt

= 1

2 r − r2 cos ψ

= −r sin ψ + ζ(t)

(22)

This shows that diﬀusion takes place only along the angular direction in the φ plane. The origin is a ﬁxed
point. Furthermore, since dr/dt > 0 inside the punctuated disk 0 < r < 1
2 , the probability that ﬂows out
of this disk cannot reenter it, and the stationary probability density F eq(x, y), shown in Fig. 3, must be
identically zero for 0 < r < 1
2 . We remark parenthetically that for 0 < λ < ∞ there are no such regions
where F eq vanishes.
For λ = 0 the Langevin equation (4) becomes linear in terms of the variable φ−1. Its solution with

initial value φ(0) = φ0 may then be given explicitly and reads

φ(t) = φ0 he− t

in which Z(t) is the Wiener process

(24)

The moments hφm(t)i may be calculated from the mth power of expression (23), since after expanding
in powers of φ0 it is possible to average all terms in the resulting series explicitly with respect to Z(t).
For t → ∞ the moment hφm(t)i is found to tend to 1
2 δm1(1 − e−2φ0 ), in agreement with what one may
conclude by combining equations (6), (18), (15), and (8). Although these moments appear to exist, the
derivation is formal in that it ignores the convergence questions of the series, and hence does not constitute
an answer to the existence problem raised at the end of Sec. 4.

9 Remarks on numerical simulation

It is natural to ask if simulating the Langevin equation for the ﬁeld φ has any advantages over simulating
a particle system. Numerical integration of the Langevin equation (4) may be carried out on a “cloud” of
points in the complex φ plane, representative of the function F (x, y, t). We illustrate below by means of
two examples two diﬀerent statistical problems that one encounters, depending on the choice of Poisson
representation.

Problems associated with large |φ|. Fig. 3 shows, for the special case λ = 0, the time evolution of the
average hφi and the constant of the motion he−2φi associated with a cloud of 10 000 points initially all
concentrated in φ = 1. For t > 0 this cloud spreads out and its average position starts moving. The initial
decay of hφi and the constancy of he−2φi are in full agreement with what we know analytically. After a
relatively short time it will begin to happen that occasionally one of the points in the cloud moves to large
negative values of x, after which it quickly returns via a large loop to a faraway region near the positive
x axis. These large excursions, when they begin to occur, dominate and distort the averages, which then

become erratic. In Fig. 3 this happens for hφi when t >
when t >

∼ 2.5, and for the more sensitive average he−2φi
∼ 1.
For the initial condition φ = 1 the average hφi should for t → ∞ tend exponentially to its equilibrium
value hφi = 1
2 . The
reason for this value is that after having made a large loop, the trajectories φ(t) arrive at large x values
that are close to even or odd n’s with the same probability. Hence the numerical errors cause a “leak”
between the two invariant subspaces (“parity violation”) which redistributes the total probability equally
over both. We have not in this study attempted to control these numerical errors.

where D is the diﬀusion constant, j a lattice site index and ∆ the lattice Laplacian. The fact that in
the Poisson representation the diﬀusion process is deterministic, suggests that Eq. (25) might be a good
starting point for numerical simulation: a part of the problem’s stochastic character has been eliminated.
Moreover, upon passing from the single site problem discussed so far to the lattice problem (25), one might

think that the diﬀusion term, because it tends to equalize the φj, would attenuate the eﬀect of excursions
deep into the negative half plane. Actual simulations show that for large enough D indeed it does, but
this advantage is oﬀset by the the fact that the asymptotic decay of the particle density (well-known to
be as t−1/2) then also sets in later.

Problems associated with small |φ|. All Monte Carlo simulations discussed above concerned real
positive probability distributions F (x, y, t). As remarked in Sec. 2, a Poisson representation may also be
realized with the aid of a quasi-probability, i.e. a function F that may take negative (or even complex)
values. The time evolution of such quasi-probabilities may also, in principle, be obtained from the Monte
Carlo simulation of the Langevin equation. We show this on the example of a state with initially exactly
N particles. Such a state may be Poisson represented by F (x, y) = δ(y)F1(x) where F1(x) is the quasi-
probability distribution

as is easily veriﬁed by substitution in Eq. (3). (An alternative formula uses a representation on a circle
of radius ǫ around the origin; we do not discuss this here.) In order to be able to work numerically with
Eq. (26) we express the derivative of the Dirac delta as

d
dx

δ(x) =

ǫ

[ δ(x − 1

2 ǫ) − δ(x + 1

2 ǫ) ]

(27)

where ǫ should be taken suﬃciently small to have a good approximation. N -fold application of Eq. (27)
yields the N th derivative as a sum of N +1 delta functions. Combining this with Eq. (26) one obtains for
the special case of N = 4

F1(x) =

1
ǫ4 [ e2ǫδ(x − 2ǫ) − 4eǫδ(x − ǫ) + 6δ(x) − 4e−ǫδ(x + ǫ) + e−2ǫδ(x + 2ǫ) ]

(28)

This representation has its support conﬁned within a circle of arbitrarily small radius around the origin in
the complex plane. We have carried out a simulation of the time evolution of the initial state (28) taking
ǫ = 0.01 and representing the initial state by four clouds of 10 000 points each. The two located in x = ±ǫ
each have weight −4e±ǫ and those in x = ±2ǫ have weight e±2ǫ. Since the FP equation for F (x, y, t) is
linear, these weights stay attached to the clouds during their time evolution. A trivial cloud with weight
6 is located in x = 0; it does not move with time, so need not be simulated, but enters into the calculation
of averages.

We have taken λ = 0. Fig. 4 shows the decay of the initial state with N = 4 particles. The curves do
not change when ǫ is taken smaller. Again, after a relatively short time strong ﬂuctuations appear and
the result becomes unreliable. This instability is due to the fact that the fourth derivative in Eq. (28)
involves the four times repeated subtraction of almost equal numbers. This explanation is conﬁrmed by
the fact that for N = 2 the instability appears at a later time, as shown for comparison in Fig. 4.

Another new feature appears in this representation. Since ǫ is arbitrarily small and the radial time
derivative dr/dt is bounded from above, as shown by the ﬁrst one of Eqs. (22), the clouds of points will
reach the circle r = 1
2 only after a time Tǫ that diverges as ǫ → 0, i.e., after the process has come arbitrarily
close to equilibrium. Hence in the limit ǫ → 0 the decay to the physical equilibrium takes place inside
the disk |φ(t)| < 1
2 , even though the equilibrium distribution P eq(n) is represented by a nonstationary
F (x, y, t) inside this disk. This simulation is probably closest to the analytical treatment of ﬁeld theory,
which amounts to working with φ close to zero.

10 Final comments

We have performed a case study – to our knowledge the ﬁrst of its kind – of various analytical and
simulational aspects of reaction–diﬀusion processes in the Poisson representation. We have identiﬁed

many curious and interesting phenomena that happen to the probability ﬂow in this representation. This
study is an exploration, and necessarily far from exhaustive. We have not discussed, for example, the
equilibrium ﬂuctuations that occur when λ > 0. One of our motivations was the search for diﬀerent and
possibly more eﬃcient Monte Carlo simulation methods for such processes. It seems clear that such a
hope is not easily realized. A more speculative perspective is a combination of the present kind of Monte
Carlo simulation with renormalization.
