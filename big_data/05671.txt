Today’s best atomic clocks are limited by frequency noise on the lasers used to interrogate the
atoms. A proposed solution to this problem is to create a superradiant laser using an optical
clock transition as its gain medium. This laser would act as an active atomic clock, and would be
highly immune to the ﬂuctuations in reference cavity length that limit today’s best lasers. Here,
we demonstrate and characterize superradiant emission from the mHz linewidth clock transition in
an ensemble of laser-cooled 87Sr atoms trapped within a high-ﬁnesse optical cavity. We measure a
collective enhancement of the emission rate into the cavity mode by a factor of more than 10,000
compared to independently radiating atoms. We also demonstrate a method for seeding superradiant
emission and observe interference between two independent transitions lasing simultaneously. We
use this interference to characterize the relative spectral properties of the two lasing sub-ensembles.

Introduction:

Optical atomic clocks have recently achieved fractional
instability in their ticking rate of a few parts in 1018 [1–
4]. Signiﬁcant improvements in the accuracy, precision
and bandwidth of clocks and the lasers used to probe
them would signiﬁcantly advance a broad range of sci-
ence and technology including: tests of general relativity
[5], proposed gravitational wave detection [6], searches
for variations of fundamental constants[7] and new grav-
itational couplings [8], searches for dark matter[9, 10],
gravitational potential sensing for geodysy [11], stabiliza-
tion of future quantum networks[12], and explorations of
quantum many-body physics[13, 14].

At the heart of these optical clocks are atoms like 87Sr,
which has a quantum state with a long decay lifetime
of roughly 150 seconds [15, 16]. The inverse lifetime of
this state corresponds to a frequency linewidth of 1 milli-
hertz, which is more than 109 times narrower than typi-
cal optically excited states. This linewidth relative to the
frequency of the optical photon emitted when the atom
decays corresponds to a large fundamental quality factor
Q = 4 × 1017, which is a key ﬁgure of merit for a clock.
However, because of frequency instability in the lasers
used to probe the atoms, today’s best clocks can only
resolve a much broader linewidth, and therefore a lower
Q — the atoms are more precise than the lasers used to
measure them [3].

For decades, heroic eﬀorts have been made to reduce
the frequency linewidth of conventional lasers by stabi-
lizing their frequency to mechanically stable optical ref-
erence cavities [17, 18]. The primary limitation of this
approach is thermal Brownian motion of the cavity mir-
ror spacing that produces noise in the cavity’s resonance
frequency [19, 20]. Here we present the ﬁrst key step to-
ward a radically diﬀerent approach to narrow linewidth
lasers — directly collecting light emitted from a long-
lived quantum state [21, 22]. Such a laser would be of
order 104 times less sensitive to thermal and technical
sources of cavity frequency noise [23, 24].

In this approach, the long lifetime becomes a serious
challenge. Typically, photons are emitted far too slowly

to serve as a useful phase or frequency reference and are
emitted into all directions, making them diﬃcult to uti-
lize. To overcome these limitations, we achieve pulsed
superradiant lasing for the ﬁrst time on an ultra-weak
optical clock transition: the mHz linewidth 3P0 to 1S0
clock transition at 698 nm in 87Sr. Superradiant stimu-
lation of photon emission allows us to eﬃciently collect
photons emitted from the 150 second lifetime state in
under 100 ms. The emitted laser light both serves as an
absolute frequency reference and oﬀers a new path to-
wards lasers with linewidths at or below the mHz level
[22], orders of magnitude narrower than has previously
been achieved with traditional optical reference cavities
[18].

In order to achieve lasing, the collectively enhanced
emission rate from the atoms must be made larger than
atomic decoherence rates, a stringent requirement for this
ultra-weak transition. To increase the collectively en-
hanced decay rate, we trap the atoms within a high ﬁ-
nesse optical cavity (Figure 1a), eﬀectively increasing the
optical depth of the atomic ensemble. To suppress atomic
decoherence, we rely on techniques used to provide long
coherence times in optical lattice clocks [25, 26] — by
laser cooling and conﬁning the atoms along the cavity
axis with a magic-wavelength optical lattice, we elimi-
nate ﬁrst-order Doppler shifts in the direction of emission
without imposing large shifts to the lasing transition fre-
quency.

In conceptually related work, Raman transitions be-
tween ground hyperﬁne states of rubidium have enabled
proof of principle explorations of lasing in the deep bad-
cavity or superradiant regime[23, 27], in which the band-
width of the laser’s gain medium (the atomic transition)
is much narrower than that of the laser’s optical cav-
ity. However, because the frequency stability of a Ra-
man laser is limited by the stability of the lasers used to
induce optical decay between ground states, such a sys-
tem is not suitable for a frequency reference. For this, a
true narrow-linewidth optical transition is required. In
addition, the clock transition used here is orders of mag-
nitude narrower than the eﬀective decay linewidth used
in Raman systems.

FIG. 1. Experimental overview (a) Our system consists of an ensemble of up to N = 2.5× 105 laser-cooled 87Sr atoms conﬁned
in a magic wavelength optical lattice within a high ﬁnesse (F = 2.4 × 104, linewidth κ = 2π × 160 kHz) optical cavity. (b)
The atoms undergo pulsed superradiant lasing on the 3P0 to 1S0 optical clock transition that has a natural decay time of
150 seconds, or an equivalent linewidth of 1 millihertz. The state of the atomic ensemble can be represented by a collective
Bloch vector, explained in the text. (c) A representation of a superradiant pulse on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector behaves
like a highly damped pendulum that starts inverted at the north pole of the Bloch sphere (excited state). Quantum ﬂuctuations
disturb the system from its unstable equilibrium position, causing the Bloch vector to swing down the Bloch sphere, emitting
peak radiation at the equator and ultimately relaxing to the south pole (ground state) as inversion is lost. The radiated electric
ﬁeld (red trace) is proportional to the perpendicular projection of the Bloch vector, J⊥, which at its peak is proportional to
N . The radiated power (black trace) is proportional to the square of the radiated electric ﬁeld, and at its peak is therefore
proportional to N 2. This is one way to understand the origin of the collective enhancement in emission rate. The black output
power trace on the projection plane is actual data.

Superradiance has been studied in a variety of other
more broadband systems, including thermal molecular
and atomic gasses [28, 29], Rydberg atoms [30], atoms
trapped near photonic crystals [31], ions [32], artiﬁcial
atoms [33], and other Raman systems [34–36]. More gen-
erally, collective interactions mediated by the 7.5 kHz
linewidth dipole-forbidden 3P1 to 1S0 transition in 88Sr
have been studied in the context of lasing, cavity QED,
and collective scattering [24, 37–40]. This work pushes
into a new regime, exploring collective interactions me-
diated by a transition nearly seven orders of magnitude
weaker than even that weak transition.

Experimental System

Our experimental system consists of up to N = 2.5 ×
105 87Sr atoms cooled to 10 µK and tightly trapped
along the axis of a high-ﬁnesse (F = 2.4 × 104, linewidth
κ = 2π × 160 kHz) optical cavity by an optical lattice.
The lattice is near the magic wavelength of 813.4274 nm,
for which the frequency shift of the two clock states is
equal, making the transition frequency independent of

lattice intensity [25]. The interaction between the atoms
and cavity mode can be characterized by the cooperativ-
ity parameter C of cavity QED. In our system, the peak
single-particle cooperativity parameter is C = 0.41 (as-
suming a Clebsch Gordan coeﬃcient of 1). This number
represents the relative probability that an atomic excita-
tion leaves the system as a photon transmitted through
a cavity mirror versus into free space. For a collective
excitation of N atoms, this ratio is enhanced to ∼ N C.
For our typical atom numbers, this means that an atom
is far more likely to emit a photon into the cavity mode
than into free space.

The state of the atomic ensemble can be represented
by a collective Bloch vector, which is the vector sum of
the Bloch vectors of the N individual atoms. This is il-
lustrated in Figure 1b. An atom in the excited state,
|e(cid:105) (3P0), has a Bloch vector pointing up, while an atom
in the ground state, |g(cid:105) (1S0), has a Bloch vector point-
ing down. An atom in an equal superposition of |e(cid:105) and
|g(cid:105) corresponds to a Bloch vector on the equator of its
Bloch sphere, with phase ϕ determined by the phase of
its superposition |g(cid:105) + eiϕ |e(cid:105). To account for the spa-
tial distribution of the atoms, the phase of each atom is

deﬁned relative to the phase of a cavity mode resonant
with the |e(cid:105) to |g(cid:105) transition, evaluated at the location
of each atom. A collective Bloch vector on the equator
of the Bloch sphere corresponds to each atom in a su-
perposition of |e(cid:105) and |g(cid:105) with the appropriate phases to
collectively radiate into the cavity mode.

The atoms radiate an electric ﬁeld into the cavity at a
rate proportional to J⊥, the magnitude of the projection
of the Bloch vector onto the equatorial plane of the Bloch
sphere. The collective enhancement of emission results
from the fact that the power radiated is proportional to
the square of the electric ﬁeld. Because the electric ﬁeld is
proportional to the atom number N , the radiated power
scales with N 2 [41]. The electric ﬁeld radiated into the
cavity acts on the atoms by causing rotation of the Bloch
vector about an axis in the equatorial plane of the Bloch
sphere by a rate proportional to
Mc, where Mc is the
average number of photons in the cavity. This is the
mechanism of stimulated emission in the superradiant
regime. For an ensemble whose Bloch vector lies in the
northern hemisphere of the Bloch sphere, this leads to
positive feedback for emission. The atoms will radiate
into the cavity, and the radiated electric ﬁeld will then
cause the Bloch vector to tip further from the north pole,
and thus to radiate more strongly. The result is a pulse
of light that builds up gradually, reaches a peak in power
as the Bloch vector passes the equator, and falls to zero
as the atoms reach the ground state (Figure 1c).

Observation of Superradiant Pulses

To observe superradiant pulses, we prepare atoms
in |e(cid:105),
the nuclear |F = 9/2, mf = 9/2(cid:105) sub-level of
3P0. We ﬁrst optically pump the atoms to |g(cid:105), the
|F = 9/2, mf = 9/2(cid:105) sub-level of 1S0, then adiabatically
transfer up to 75% of the atoms to |e(cid:105) using a frequency-
swept 698 nm transfer beam applied through the cavity.
To prepare the atoms with full inversion (no atoms in |g(cid:105))
and to ensure that the laser pulses are initiated by quan-
tum noise rather than residual atomic coherence associ-
ated with the adiabatic transfer process, we then brieﬂy
apply lasers to the dipole-allowed 1S0 to 1P1 transition
to heat any atoms remaining in the ground state out of
the lattice. The state-preparation process is described in
more detail in the supplemental material.
When all atoms are initially prepared in |e(cid:105), we ob-
serve collectively enhanced decay on the clock transition.
Both quantitative and qualitative features of the collec-
tively enhanced emission are dramatically diﬀerent from
that of independent atoms. Not only does the collec-
tive enhancement lead to an emission rate into the cav-
ity mode of up to 104 times greater than that of inde-
pendently emitting atoms, but the functional form of the
decay versus time is distinctly non-exponential. Figure
2a shows the photon output rate R for four representa-
tive pulses recorded with diﬀerent initial atom numbers.
Because the rate of collectively enhanced emission per

Figure 2b shows the characteristic N 2 scaling of the
peak output power Rpeak versus atom number that one
expects for superradiance. In the presence of decoherence
or atom loss, the atom number must exceed a threshold
Nt for superradiance to occur. Nt is set by the require-
ment that the collectively enhanced decay rate exceeds
the atomic decoherence rate. Above this threshold, we

total number of atoms in the lattice N in excess of the
theshold atom number. The inhomogeneous coupling of
the atoms to the cavity mode is accounted for by the nu-
merical factor ξ ≈ 2.95. (see supplemental material for
details and note that all following expressions account for
this inhomogeneity.) From a ﬁt of this form, we extract
a ﬁtted threshold of Nt = 3.3 × 104 atoms. From the
ﬁtted Nt and known C and γ, the measured peak photon
emission rate Rpeak is 0.7(4) times the above predicted
rate.

The time duration of the superradiant pulse provides
a measure of the collectively enhanced decay rate. The
measured FWHM versus atom number N is shown in
Figure 2c (blue points). We predict that the FWHM
duration tw of the pulse is given by tw ≈ 7.05/(NxCγ),
such that the enhanced decay rate scales linearly with
the excess atom number Nx. We ﬁt this functional form
(blue line) to the data, with the threshold held ﬁxed to
Nt = 3.3 × 104 atoms from above. From this ﬁt we ﬁnd
that the measured FWHM is 1.4(7) times the predicted
FWHM given the known C and γ.

The measured delay time td of the peak in output
power versus atom number N is shown in Figure 2c (red
points). In the presence of homogeneous broadening of
the atomic transition, but with no atom loss, we expect
the delay time to be given by td ≈ 2(ln N +γe)
(dashed red
ﬁt line with Nt ﬁxed and C ﬁtted), where γe ≈ 0.577 is
the Euler-Mascheroni constant. In the presence of atom
loss from the lattice at rate γ(cid:96), we observe a delay time in
numerical simulations of the form td ≈ αγ(cid:96) + 2(ln N +γe)
where α is a constant, a functional form which seems to
better describe the data (solid red ﬁt line with Nt ﬁxed
and C and α ﬁt.)

We deﬁne the number of atoms that participated in
a superradiant pulse in terms of the integrated number
of photons Mtot emitted from the cavity mode, i.e. one
photon equals one participating atom. Figure 2d shows
the number of emitted photons per atom in excess of
threshold, Mtot/Nx. We observe that above threshold,
Mtot/Nx = 0.48(15).
Inhomogeneous coupling to the
cavity mode would predict Mtot/Nx = 0.7 partially ac-
counting for the observed participation. Atomic colli-
sions, which lead to an atom-number dependent contri-
bution to Nt may account for the additional reduction
of participation. We may contrast this level of partic-
ipation to the case where atoms emit independently:
if
there were no stimulation, only 0.1% of atoms would emit

FIG. 3. Seeded superradiant pulses. (a) By terminating adi-
abatic transfer with atoms in a superposition of |e(cid:105) and |g(cid:105),
we seed coherence in the atomic ensemble. Here, the atomic
Bloch vector is rotated to just above the equator (i.e. a small
amount of initial inversion.) Seeding leads to the immediate
onset of superradiant emission, in contrast to the non-seeded
pulses shown in Figure 2 for which quantum noise seeds the
coherence. (b) Peak output power for seeded pulses exhibits
N 2 scaling. In contrast to results of Figure 2, seeded pulses
exhibit a peak photon output rate consistent with no thresh-
old: Nt = 0.

Seeding Atomic Coherence

Instead of preparing the atomic ensemble in the ex-
cited state with no initial coherence as before, we can
terminate the adiabatic transfer process early and pre-
pare the atoms in a superposition of |g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105). This
seeds the collectively enhanced emission and unlike in
the non-seeded pulses of ﬁgure 2, we detect an immediate
output of light from the cavity. Figure 3a shows a typi-
cal output trace resulting from terminating the adiabatic
transfer with the Bloch vector just above the equator of
the Bloch sphere.

Seeding the coherence in this manner also eliminates
the threshold behavior observed in the spontaneously
generated pulses of Figure 2. Figure 3b shows the peak

that a smaller number of atoms have been prepared in mf = 5/2. A Lorentzian ﬁt to the average power spectrum (red line)
returns a FWHM linewidth of 11 Hz, due to the ﬁnite length of the pulse. The inset of (b) shows the center frequency of the

output power Rpeak versus N for pulses seeded with the
Bloch vector just above the equator of the Bloch sphere.
This data is well described by a quadratic ﬁt with no
oﬀset, i.e. Nt = 0.

We view this technique for establishing collectively en-
hanced emission with no threshold or delay time to be
a key tool for the development of superradiant sources.
In this work, being able to use these signatures of col-
lectively enhanced emission to incrementally tune the
system to meet threshold was essential. More funda-
mentally, seeding allows collectively enhanced emission
to be achieved in systems that are incapable of meeting
threshold, but that may still be of metrological value. If
superradiant pulses are used to stabilize the frequency of
another laser, seeding could be used to reduce dead-time
that contributes to Dick noise aliasing [42].

Simultaneous Lasing on Multiple Transitions

For all preceding data, we applied optical pumping to
populate primarily the 1S0, mf = 9/2 sub-level before
adiabatic transfer, resulting in a single relevant lasing
transition. We can deliberately reduce the eﬃciency of
the optical pumping to populate both the mf = 9/2 and
mf = 7/2 ground states, and then adiabatically trans-
fer the atoms into superpositions of ground and excited
states with diﬀerent mf projections, represented in Fig-
ure 4a. This creates two separate sub-ensembles of atoms

that interact with the same cavity mode but have slightly
diﬀerent transition frequencies [43, 44]. We observe a
modulation in the output power at the magnetic-ﬁeld in-
duced frequency diﬀerence between the two transitions.
This modulation is the result of interference between the
ﬁelds radiated by the atoms lasing on the two transitions.
Because more atoms are prepared in the mf = 9/2 sub-
level, the total ﬁeld radiated never goes through zero and
the contrast of the modulation is not full.

Figure 4b shows the average of 20 time traces recorded
under these conditions, illustrating that the phase of the
modulation is the same between trials, a result of seed-
ing coherence into the two transitions. To verify that
the observed amplitude modulation is the result of beat-
ing between adjacent Zeeman transitions, we compute a
Fourier transform of the emitted power (Figure 4c) and
ﬁt the peak in the power spectrum that corresponds to
the output power modulation. The frequency of this peak
is plotted against our applied magnetic ﬁeld in the inset
of Figure 4b. The slope and oﬀset of beat frequency are
consistent with the expected Zeeman splitting between
the mf = 9/2 and mf = 7/2 transitions. The smaller
peak near 400 Hz indicates that a smaller number of
atoms have been left in the mf = 5/2 state.

A Lorentzian ﬁt to the peak in the average power spec-
trum returns a FWHM linewidth of 11 Hz, primarily
reﬂecting the ﬁnite length of the pulse. Because many
photons are detected in a trial of the experiment, we can
ﬁt the center of the Lorentzian peak with deviation much

6

smaller than its width.

Treating this as a diﬀerential frequency measurement
of two lasers, we compute a fractional Allan deviation of
2.6 × 10−15 at ≈ 2 seconds, the repetition rate of our
experiment. Because many sources of frequency errors
that are common-mode to the two lasing transitions are
not captured by this measurement, this number does not
indicate the ultimate performance of the system as a fre-
quency reference. It does, however, reﬂect a bound on its
quantum-limited instability. To more fully characterize
the spectral properties of the emitted light, including its
sensitivity to eﬀects that are common to the two transi-
tions used here, it will be necessary to perform a com-
parison with an independent narrow linewidth laser [18],
which is a subject for future work.

emitted light is not limited by the collectively enhanced
decay rate, as would be the case for single-atom decay
[23, 24]. Rather, the fundamental limit to the linewidth
of the laser is of order Cγ, resulting from phase diﬀusion
of the cavity ﬁeld due to single-atom emission into the
cavity mode [22].

This work demonstrates that dramatic eﬀects can re-
sult from collective interactions with an optical ﬁeld, even
when mediated by an optical transition so weak that it
takes roughly 150 seconds to decay without stimulation.
These interactions lead to stimulated emission in a regime
where the cavity ﬁeld is much shorter lived than the co-
herence of the atomic ensemble, and open new avenues
for the improvement of optical clocks, ultrastable lasers,
and other atomic sensors along with their many applica-
tions.

Conclusion and Outlook

Acknowledgements

We have demonstrated that an ultra-narrow optical
transition can be made to lase in a pulsed manner, with
each atom emitting up to a single photon.
In the fu-
ture, it will be advantageous to operate in a continuous
manner, with pump lasers applied to return the atoms
to the excited state and a means of replenishing atoms
lost to heating or collisions. An important property of a
continuous superradiant laser is that the linewidth of the

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

Atom Cooling and Trapping

A new ensemble of atoms is loaded into the optical
lattice roughly every 2 seconds. An atomic source from
AOSense, Inc. with integrated oven, Zeeman slower and
two 2-dimensional magneto-optical traps (MOTs) pro-
vides a collimated beam of atoms with speeds around 50
m/s to the main experimental chamber [45]. Roughly
107 atoms are then captured and accumulated in a 3-
dimensional MOT, and further cooled to mK tempera-
tures. These slowing and cooling stages use the dipole-
allowed 1S0 to 1P1 transition at 461 nm (see Figure S1).
To cool the atoms to a temperature compatible with
loading into the optical lattice, we then form a second-
stage MOT using the 7.5-kHz linewidth, dipole-forbidden
1S0 F = 11/2 to 3P1 F = 11/2 transition at 689 nm. We
ﬁnd that by applying a saw-tooth frequency modulation
with peak-to-peak frequency deviation of 2 MHz to the
MOT beams, we can robustly load up to 3 × 105 atoms
into the lattice at a temperature of 10µK, as determined
by turning oﬀ the lattice and measuring time-of-ﬂight ex-
pansion of the atoms. The atoms are spread over roughly
1 mm along the cavity axis, corresponding to around 2000
occupied lattice sites.

At 698 (813) nm, the 4 cm long cavity mode has a
waist size of 74 (80) µm. At a typical lattice depth of
100 µK, the frequency of axial (radial) motion in the
trap is 170 kHz (270 Hz), giving a Lamb-Dicke parameter
η = 0.16 in the axial direction [46]. For the |e(cid:105) to |g(cid:105)
transition studied here C = 0.33, and the single photon
Rabi frequency is 2g = 2 × 2π × 3.7 Hz for a maximally
coupled atom.

State Preparation and Adiabatic Transfer

Once atoms are loaded into the lattice, we apply a
magnetic ﬁeld of several Gauss perpendicular to the cav-
ity to deﬁne the quantization axis. We then typically
optically pump atoms to the mf = 9/2 state by apply-
ing a circularly polarized pump beam oriented along the

Figure S1. Energy level diagram of relevant transitions. The
dipole-allowed 1S0 to 1P1 transition (linewidth 32 MHz) is
used for initial cooling and trapping. The dipole-forbidden
1S0 to 3P1, transition (linewidth 7.5 kHz) is used for ﬁnal
cooling into the optical lattice, and for optically pumping
into the 1S0 mf = 9/2 Zeeman sublevel. Superradiant las-
ing is observed on the dipole-forbidden 1S0 to 3P0, transition
(linewidth 1 mHz) at 698 nm.

magnetic ﬁeld axis and near resonance with the 1S0 to
3P1, F = 9/2 transition.

We adiabatically transfer the atoms to 3P0 by apply-
ing a 698 nm laser sideband along the cavity axis. The
transfer sideband is coupled to a TEM00 mode of the cav-
ity, and is linearly swept by 200 kHz in 20 ms over the
mode of the cavity that is on resonance with the clock
transition.

The intensity of the 698 nm light at the location of indi-
vidual atoms is spatially modulated by the standing wave
formed within the cavity, with a peak Rabi frequency for
atoms at antinodes of the cavity mode of roughly 5 kHz.
We can transfer up to 75% of the atoms to 3P0. Because
the transfer beam is linearly polarized along the mag-
netic ﬁeld, the atoms maintain their spin polarization
mf when transferred to 3P0. Because the transfer beam
is applied parallel to the cavity axis, along which the
atoms are tightly conﬁned in the Lamb-Dicke regime, the
interaction between the transfer beam and the atoms is
Doppler-shift free. The frequency sweep range is slightly
greater than the cavity linewidth. Larger sweep ranges
are found to perform less well, presumably because the
frequency crosses an axial motional sideband transition
frequency.

The adiabatic transfer technique has several advan-
tages over other techniques of populating the excited
state. Compared to an incoherent pumping process
where atoms reach 3P0 from a higher-lying excited state,
adiabatic transfer maintains the spin polarization present

in the ground states and imparts far fewer photon recoils
than would be required for optical pumping in 3P0. Com-
pared to a resonant π pulse, adiabatic transfer has the
advantage of being less sensitive to the diﬀerence in Rabi
frequencies experienced by diﬀerent atoms and requires
less stringent stabilization of the transfer laser frequency.
Because the transfer beam is phase-matched to the cavity
mode, terminating the transfer sweep near atomic reso-
nance creates an atomic ensemble whose atoms are in
superposition states with the correct phases to radiate
into the cavity mode. This allows us to prepare superra-
diant states, which emit collectively with no threshold or
delay time.

Detection of Pulses and Atom Number

To detect the superradiant laser pulses, the output of
the cavity is coupled to a single-mode ﬁber and detected
on a single-photon counting module (SPCM) whose TTL
output is low-pass ﬁltered to provide a signal propor-
tional to the photon emission rate.

After allowing a ﬁxed time T (typically 300 ms) to
record the superradiant pulses, we perform atom count-
ing using a resonant 461 nm ﬂuorescence beam and a
CCD camera. We calibrate the ﬂuorescence signal by
measuring a vacuum Rabi splitting on the 1S0 to 3P1,
F = 9/2 transition, as described in [37]. To measure total
atom number, we apply pump lasers to the 3P0 and 3P2
to 3S1 transitions to drive all atoms to the ground state.
We then infer the number of atoms at the beginning of
the 300 ms superradiance time window from a measured
background loss rate from the lattice of γ0 = 2.0(4)/s
and a measured additional atom-number dependent col-
lissional loss rate of γN = 10(5) × 10−6/(atom s) for ex-
cited state atoms. To account for the state-dependence
of the collisions, we make a lowest order correction for
the decrease in excited state population after the super-
radiant pulse, which leads to a 5% correction at 175,000
atoms, and a <1% correction below 100,000 atoms.

Simulations of Superradiance

To provide theoretical predictions for superradiance in
the presence of inhomogeneous coupling to the cavity
mode and atomic decoherence and loss, we integrate a
set of simpliﬁed optical Bloch equations:

˙Jz = −CγJ 2⊥ − γ(cid:96)Jz,

(S1)

˙J⊥ = (CγJz − γ⊥ − γ(cid:96))J⊥.

Here, Jz and J⊥ are deﬁned in Figure 1, γ(cid:96) accounts
for atom loss, and γ⊥ accounts for other homogeneous
atomic decoherence. In reality, both γ(cid:96) and γ⊥ depend
on N , and on the instantaneous distribution of popula-
tion in ground and excited states. For simplicity, and to

8

arrive at the analytic expressions given below, we assume
γ(cid:96) and γ⊥ to be constants. In arriving at these equations,
we have assumed that the cavity mode is on resonance
with the atomic transition, and that the cavity mode oc-
cupation quickly equilibrates to the instantaneous value
of J⊥. As discussed in [41], the dynamics of superradi-
ance consist of an initial time period, during which quan-
tum ﬂuctuations are important in providing initial coher-
ence, and a later time period during which the classically
radiated ﬁeld greatly exceeds quantum ﬂuctuations and
the dynamics proceed classically, governed by the above
equations. In the later time period, these equations can
easily be solved for the case of homogeneous coupling and
γ⊥, γ(cid:96) = 0, with solutions of the form:

(cid:18) N Cγ(t − td)

To simulate the quantum ﬂuctuations in the cavity
ﬁeld that lead to the onset of superradiance, we include
a drive to J⊥ that represents random vacuum ﬂuctua-
tions that are replaced at the cavity amplitude decay
rate κ/2. This allows us to simulate the initial condi-
tions that lead to the time delay td. We verify that in
the limit of large atom number our simulation reproduces
the expected peak power, as well as the pulse duration
tw and time delay td of the peak output power derived
in [41].

Eﬀects of Atomic Decoherence and Loss

Atomic decoherence, or a decay of J⊥ at a rate γ⊥,
has the eﬀect of setting a threshold atom number Nt be-
low which a superradiant pulse will not occur without
seeding of coherence. This threshold can be derived from
Equation S1 by setting Jz = N/2 to determine the min-
imum value of N for which ﬂuctuations in J⊥ will grow.
For atoms homogeneously coupled with cooperativity C,
Nt = 2γ⊥/(Cγ). For atom numbers above this threshold
value, N atoms radiating in the presence of decoherence
produce a pulse identical to the pulse that the number
of excess atoms, Nx = N − Nt, would produce in the
absence of decoherence. The solutions for J⊥ and Jz for
homogeneous coupling in the presence of decoherence γ⊥
are

To treat the eﬀects of atom loss, we rely on numerical

simulation.

we observe a threshold-like behavior at an atom number
of Nt(cid:96) ≈ 13.6γ(cid:96)/(Cγ), assuming homogeneous coupling.
For atom numbers well above threshold, peak output
power and pulse duration are well-described by assuming
an ensemble of N − Nt(cid:96) atoms radiating in the absence
of loss. Near threshold, however, the peak power radi-
ated is higher and the pulse duration is shorter than that
predicted by this analogy. The delay time of the pulse
exhibits a more striking diﬀerence: at ﬁxed atom num-
ber, the delay time of the pulse peak increases linearly
with loss rate up to the threshold loss rate.

From our measured atom loss rate, assuming uni-
form inhomogeneous coupling (deﬁned below), we ex-
pect a contribution to the threshold atom number of
3.0(6) × 104. The measured value is 3.3(8) × 104, which
may indicate that the threshold behavior is due primarily
to atom loss.

The rates of atom loss and decoherence due to atomic
collisions scale in proportion to the number of atoms,
N . This leads to a threshold atom number whose value
depends on N . This raises the threshold atom number
compared to its value in the absence of N -dependent de-
coherence and leads to a constant fractional reduction
in Nx. For our measured atom-number dependent loss
rate, we expect the threshold atom number to increase
by 0.13(7) for each atom added. This eﬀectively decreases
Nx by 13% compared to its value if the same threshold
were the result of atom number independent processes
only. Collisions that do not lead to atom loss, but whose
rate would also scale with N could lead to additional
decrease in Nx.

Eﬀects of Inhomogeneous Coupling

In our system, the atoms are trapped at anti-nodes of
the 813 nm lattice, which are not aligned with the anti-
nodes of the lasing cavity mode at 698 nm. The coupling
of an individual atom to the lasing mode thus depends
on its location along the cavity axis.

We numerically simulate the eﬀects of this inhomoge-
neous coupling by dividing the atoms into many classes,
each with its own location xi and value of coupling to
the lasing mode gi = g cos(kxi), where k is the k-vector
associated with the 698 nm cavity mode. We may rea-
sonably assume that before atoms are transferred to 3P0,

9

they are eﬀectively uniformly distributed with respect to
the phase of the standing-wave 698 nm cavity mode. For
simplicity, we analyze the case where the atoms maintain
this uniform distribution after being transferred to 3P0,
meaning that the values of xi are sampled from a uniform
distribution. In reality, the adiabatic transfer is probably
more eﬀective for atoms located at the anti-nodes of the
698 nm cavity mode, as these experience a higher Rabi
frequency from the transfer beam. The true distribution
of couplings for diﬀerent transfer parameters will thus
lie somewhere between the uniform distribution and the
homogeneously coupled case.

Below, we summarize the results of the numerical
simulations for key parameters under these two condi-
tions: homogeneous coupling and uniformly inhomoge-
neous coupling. Homogeneous coupling refers to the case
where all N atoms are at anti-nodes of the lasing mode
and are coupled with peak coupling g. Uniform inhomo-
geneous coupling refers to the case where N atoms are
distributed uniformly along the cavity mode. In all ex-
pressions, C stands for the peak cooperativity C = 4g2
κγ .
The eﬀect of uniform inhomogeneous coupling on td,
tw, and Nt is to reduce C by a factor of 2, correspond-
ing to taking the spatial average of C over the ensemble
of atoms.
Its eﬀects on the peak photon output rate
Rpeak and the fraction of atoms emitted into the cav-
ity mode Mtot/N , however, are more complex. Diﬀering
Rabi frequencies within the ensemble cause the atoms to
dephase with respect to the polar angle θ. This shortens
the length of the collective Bloch vector at the time of
peak emission and strands poorly coupled atoms in |e(cid:105)
when the pulse terminates, leaving 30% of atoms in the
excited state.

The ﬁnite temperature of the atoms within the lattice
leads to a reduction of C through several mechanisms.
The ﬁnite temperature of the atoms leads to a non-zero
radial extent of the ensemble, which causes the atoms to
sample regions with lower coupling to the cavity mode.
At 10 µK, this leads to a 10% reduction in the spatially
averaged C. The ﬁnite Lamb-Dicke parameter η = 0.16
also leads to a reduction C for the motional carrier tran-
sition observed here. We estimate this eﬀect to lead to
a 7.5% reduction in C. To compare measured values of
Rpeak and tw to predictions in the main text, we take into
account these two temperature-related eﬀects, as well as
the 13% reduction in Nx from the measured atom num-
ber dependent loss rate.
