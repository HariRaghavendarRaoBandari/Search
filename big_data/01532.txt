1. Introduction

Let Bn ⊂ Cn denote the unit ball for the standard Hermitian product in Cn, n ≥ 1.
For the sake of simplicity, we will just consider the case n = 1 and n = 2, but, in fact,
all results which we are going to discuss for B2 hold in any dimension. We also denote
D := B1.

Let S(Bn) denote the class of univalent maps f : Bn → Cn normalized so that f (0) =
0, df0 = id. We consider S(Bn) as a subspace of the Frech´et space of holomorphic maps
from Bn to Cn with the topology of uniform convergence on compacta.

For n = 1, the set S(D) is compact (see, e.g.

[11]). For n > 1, the set S(D) is
not compact: a simple example is given by considering the sequence {(z1, z2) 7→ (z1 +
mz2

2 , z2)}m∈N, which belongs to S(B2) but for m → ∞ does not converge.

F. BRACCI AND O. ROTH

Being the set S(D) compact, every continuous linear operator L : Hol(D, C) → C is
either constant on S(D) or there exists f ∈ S(D), a so called support point for L, such
that Re L(f ) ≥ Re L(g) for all g ∈ S(D).
It is known that every support point in S(D) is unbounded and in fact, it is a slit
map (see, [13]). The most interesting linear functionals to be considered are perhaps

those deﬁned as Lm(f ) = bm, where f (z) = Pj≥0 bjzj ∈ S(D), m ∈ N. The Bieberbach
conjecture, proved in the 80’s by L. de Branges, states that |bm| ≤ m for f ∈ S(D) and
that equality is reached only by rotations of the Koebe function.
In higher dimension, since the class S(B2) is not compact, one is forced to consider
suitable compact subclasses. Convex maps and starlike maps form compact subclasses,
but, for many purposes, these classes are too small. In [7] (see also [6]), it was introduced a
compact subclass, denoted by S0(B2) (or simply S0), for which the membership depends
on the existence of a parametric representation, a condition that is always satisﬁed in
dimension one thanks to the classical Loewner theory (see Section 2).

The class S0 is strictly contained in S := S(B2), but evidences are that every map
in S might be factorized as the composition of an element of S0 and a normalized entire
univalent map of C2 (this is known to be true for univalent maps on B2 which extend C 1 up
to ∂B2 and whose image is Runge in C2, see [10]). Were this the case, one would somehow
split the diﬃculties in understanding univalent maps on B2 in two pieces: understanding
the compact class S0 and automorphisms/Fatou-Bieberbach maps in C2. In the light of
this, the class S0 seems to be the natural candidate to study in higher dimension.

The present note focuses on support points on S0. Our aim is on the one side to
state some natural open questions originated by the recent works [2, 3, 10, 12], and on
the other side to develop some new techniques to handle such problems (in particular,
slice reduction and decoupling harmonic terms tricks). The paper [8] contains other open
questions in this direction and an extensive bibliography on the subject, which we refer
the reader to. Here we mainly focus our attention to those questions which relate the
class S0 to the (huge) group of automorphisms of C2, enlightening the deep diﬀerences
between dimension 1 and dimension 2 (see Section 4).

We also develop the ideas in [3] (see Section 6), which allowed to construct an example
of a bounded support point in S0. With these tools at hand, we state a Bieberbach-type
conjecture in S0 for coeﬃcients of pure terms in z1 and z2 in the expansion at the origin.

2. The class S0

In what follows we denote by R+ the semigroup of nonnegative real numbers and by N

the semigroup of nonnegative integer numbers.

Let

M := {h ∈ Hol(B2, C2) : h(0) = 0, dh0 = id, Rehh(z), zi > 0,∀z ∈ B2 \ {0}},

where h·,·i denotes the Euclidean inner product in C2.

SUPPORT POINTS AND THE BIEBERBACH CONJECTURE

The set M is compact in Hol(B2, C2) endowed with the topology of uniform convergence

on compacta (see [6]).
Deﬁnition 2.1. A Herglotz vector ﬁeld associated with the class M on B2 is a mapping
G : B2 × R+ → C2 with the following properties:

(i) The mapping G(z,·) is measurable on R+ for all z ∈ B2.
(ii) −G(·, t) ∈ M for a.e. t ∈ [0, +∞).

Remark 2.2. Due to the estimates for the class M (see [6]), a Herglotz vector ﬁeld as-
sociated with the class M on B2 is an L∞-Herglotz vector ﬁeld on B2 in the sense of
[4].

Deﬁnition 2.3. A family (ft)t≥0 of holomorphic mappings from B2 to C2 such that
ft(0) = 0 and d(ft)0 = etid for all t ≥ 0, is called a normalized regular family if
(i) the mapping t 7→ ft is continuous with respect to the topology in Hol(B2, C2) induced
by the uniform convergence on compacta in B2,
(ii) there exists a set of zero measure N ⊂ [0, +∞) such that for all t ∈ [0, +∞) \ N and
all z ∈ B2 the partial derivative ∂ft

∂t (z) exists and it is holomorphic.

For a given Herglotz vector ﬁeld G(z, t) associated with the class M on B2, a normal-
ized solution to the Loewner-Kufarev PDE associated to G(z, t) consists of a normalized
regular family (ft)t≥0 such that the following equation is satisﬁed for a.e. t ≥ 0 and for
all z ∈ B2
(2.1)

∂ft
∂t

(z) = −d(ft)z · G(z, t).

Deﬁnition 2.4. A normalized subordination chain (ft)t≥0 is a family of holomorphic
mappings ft : B2 → C2, such that ft(0) = 0, d(ft)0 = etid for all t ≥ 0, and for every
0 ≤ s ≤ t there exists ϕs,t : B2 → B2 holomorphic such that fs = ft ◦ ϕs,t. A normalized
subordination chain (ft)t≥0 is called a normalized Loewner chain if for all t ≥ 0 the
mapping ft is univalent.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A normalized Loewner chain (ft)t≥0 on B2 is called a normal Loewner
chain if the family {e−tft(·)}t≥0 is normal.

From [6, Chapter 8], [1, Prop. 2.6] and [9], we have the following:

Theorem 2.6.

(1) If (ft)t≥0 is any normalized Loewner chain on B2, then it is a
normalized solution to a Loewner-Kufarev PDE (2.1) for some Herglotz vector
ﬁeld G(z, t) associated with the class M in B2.
(2) Let G(z, t) be a Herglotz vector ﬁeld associated with the class M on B2. Then
there exists a unique normal Loewner chain (gt)t≥0—called the canonical solution—

which is a normalized solution to (2.1). Moreover, St≥0 gt(B2) = C2.

4

F. BRACCI AND O. ROTH

(3) If (ft)t≥0 is a normalized solution to (2.1), then (ft)t≥0 is a normalized subordi-
nation chain on B2. Moreover, there exists a holomorphic mapping Φ : C2 →
St≥0 ft(B2), with Φ(0) = 0 and dΦ0 = id such that ft = Φ◦ gt, where (gt)t≥0 is the
canonical solution to (2.1). In particular, (ft)t≥0 is a normalized Loewner chain if
and only if Φ is univalent.

Remark 2.7. Let (ft)t≥0 be a family of holomorphic mappings such that ft(0) = 0, d(ft)0 =
etid for all t ≥ 0. Assume that (ft)t≥0 satisﬁes (i) of Deﬁnition 2.3 and for all ﬁxed z ∈ B2
the mapping t 7→ ft(z) is absolutely continuous. If for all ﬁxed z ∈ B2 the family (ft)t≥0
satisﬁes (2.1) for a.e. t ≥ 0, then it a normalized solution to the Loewner-Kufarev PDE
and thus it is a regular family.
Deﬁnition 2.8. Let f ∈ S. We say that f admits parametric representation if

f (z) = lim
t→∞
locally uniformly on B2, where ϕ(z, 0) = z and

etϕ(z, t)

∀ z ∈ B2,
(2.2)
for some Herglotz vector ﬁeld G associated with the class M on B2.

(z, t) = G(ϕ(z, t), t),

a.e. t ≥ 0,

∂ϕ
∂t

We denote by S0 the set consisting of univalent mappings which admit parametric

representation.

The following result is in [6, Chapter 8] (see also [7]):

Theorem 2.9.

(1) A normalized univalent map f : B2 → C2 has parametric repre-
sentation if and only if there exists a normal Loewner chain (ft)t≥0 on B2 such
that f0 = f .

(2) The class S0 is compact in the topology of uniform convergence on compacta.

3. Support points and extreme points

Deﬁnition 3.1. (i) Let K be a compact subset of Hol(B2, C2) endowed with the topology
of uniform convergence on compacta. A mapping f ∈ K is called a support point if there
exists a continuous linear operator L : Hol(B2, C2) → C not constant on K such that
maxg∈K Re L(g) = Re L(f ). We denote by Supp(K) the set of support points of K.
(ii) A mapping f ∈ K is called an extreme point if f = tg + (1 − t)h, where t ∈ (0, 1),

g, h ∈ K, implies f = g = h. We denote by Ex(K) the set of extreme points of K.

Note that the notion of extreme points is not related to topology, but only on the
geometry of the set. If K is a compact subset of Hol(B2, C2) and a ∈ K is a support
point which maximizes the continuous linear operator L, then L := {b ∈ Hol(B2, C2) :
Re L(b) = Re L(a)} is a real hyperplane and L∩K contains extreme points. Therefore, for
any continuous linear operator L which is not constant on K there exists a point a ∈ K
which is at the same time both support (for L) and extreme for K.

SUPPORT POINTS AND THE BIEBERBACH CONJECTURE

In dimension one it is known that all support points for S0 are slit mappings (see [13]).

In higher dimension the situation is fairly more rich and complicated.
Proposition 3.2. [12] Let f ∈ S0 be a support point. Let G(z, t) be a Herglotz vector
ﬁeld associated with the class M which generates a normal Loewner chain (ft) such that
f0 = f . Then G(z, t) is a support point of −M for a.e. t ≥ 0.
Question 3.3. Let f ∈ S0 be a support point.

(1) Does there exist only one normal Loewner chain (ft) such that f0 = f ?
(2) Does there exists a Herglotz vector ﬁeld associated with the class M which generates
a normal Loewner chain (ft) with f0 = f such that t 7→ G(·, t) is continuous and
G(·, t) ∈ supp(−M) for all t ≥ 0 ?

Question 3.4. Let G(z, t) be a Herglotz vector ﬁeld associated with the class M which
generates a normal Loewner chain (ft).

(1) If f0 is extreme in S0, is it true that G(z, t) is extreme in −M for a.e. t ≥ 0?
(2) If f0 is extreme in S0, is it true that G(z, t) is uniquely determined ?

Proposition 3.5. [14] Let (ft) be a normal Loewner chain. Then for all t ≥ 0, e−tft ∈ S0.
Moreover, if f0 is a support/extreme point for S0, so is e−tft for all t ≥ 0.
Deﬁnition 3.6. Let (ft)t≥0 be a normalized Loewner chain in B2 and G(z, t) be the
associated Herglotz vector ﬁeld. We say that (ft)t≥0 is exponentially squeezing in [T1, T2),
for 0 ≤ T1 < T2 ≤ +∞ (with squeezing ratio a ∈ (0, 1)) if for a.e. t ∈ [T1, T2) and for all
z ∈ B2 \ {0} it holds
(3.1)

z

Re (cid:28)G(z, t),

In [2] it is proved that (3.1) is equivalent to: for all T1 ≤ s < t < T2 it holds

(3.2)

kf −1

t

(fs(z))k ≤ ea(s−t)kzk,

for all z ∈ B2.

Hence, if (ft) is exponentially squeezing in [T1, T2), then ft is bounded for all t ∈ [0, T2)
Using the results of [2], or of [12] for support points, one can prove

and fs(B2) ⊂ ft(B2) for all T1 ≤ s < t < T2.

Proposition 3.7. Let (ft) be a normal Loewner chain which is exponentially squeezing
in [T1, T2). Then f0 6∈ Supp(S0) ∪ Ex(S0).
Example 3.8. Let f ∈ S0. Let (ft) be one parametric representation of f . Let r ∈ (0, 1).
Consider fr,t(z) := r−1ft(rz). Then (fr,t) is an exponentially squeezing normal Loewner
chain and in particular, fr ∈ S0 \ (Supp(S0) ∪ Ex(S0)).
Question 3.9. Let f ∈ S0 \ (Supp(S0) ∪ Ex(S0)) be a bounded function. Is it true that f
can be embedded into an exponentially squeezing Loewner chain?

Question 3.10. Let G(z, t) be a Herglotz vector ﬁeld associated with the class M which
generates a normal Loewner chain (ft). Assume that

Re (cid:28)G(z, t),

kzk2(cid:29) ≤ −a,

for some A ⊂ ∂B2 and a.e. t ≥ 0. Is it true that f0 6∈ Supp(S0) ∪ Ex(S0)?

4. Automorphisms of C2 and support points

Let

Given f ∈ Aut0(C2), for every r > 0, the map f r : B2 → C2 deﬁned by

Aut0(C2) := {f ∈ Aut(C2) : f (0) = 0, df0 = id}.

f r(z) =

f (rz),

1
r

is normalized and univalent. For r << 1, the image f r(B2) is convex, hence f r ∈ S0. For
f ∈ Aut0(C2), let
Since S0 is compact and {f t}t>0 is not normal except for f = id, it follows that for
f ∈ Aut0(C2) \ {id}

r(f ) := sup{t > 0 : f t ∈ S0}.

0 < r(f ) < +∞,

f r(f ) ∈ S0.

Question 4.1. Let f ∈ Aut0(C2) \ {id}. Is it true that f r(f ) ∈ Supp(S0)?

The previous question has a positive solution in the case f (z1, z2) = (z1 + az2

2, z2), as

we discuss later (or see [3]).

Let

A := {f ∈ S0 : there exists Ψ ∈ Aut(C2) : Ψ|B2 = f}

Note that in dimension one the analogue of A contains only the identity mapping. In
higher dimension we have
Theorem 4.2. [10] A = S0.

Take f ∈ S0, and expand f as

f (z1, z2) = (z1 + Xα∈N2,|α|≥2

By a result of F. Forstneric [5], for any M ∈ N there exists g ∈ Aut0(C2) such that
f − g = O(kzkM +1) (that is f, g have the same jets up to order M). However, such a g
does not belong to S0 in general.
Question 4.3. For which α ∈ N2 it holds that for any f ∈ S0 there exists g ∈ A having
the same coeﬃcient b1

The problem of ﬁnding the maximal possible sharp bound for coeﬃcients of mappings in
the class S0, consists in fact in ﬁnding the support points in S0 for the linear functionals

α.
If (f1(z1, z2), f2(z1, z2)) ∈ S0 then (f2(z2, z1), f1(z2, z1)) ∈ S0. Therefore, it is enough
to solve the problem for L1
α. More generally, if U is a 2 × 2 unitary matrix, given a
normal Loewner chain (ft), (U ∗ft(U z)) is again a normal Loewner chain. This allows for
instance to assume that a given coeﬃcient b1
α(g) =
maxg∈S 0 |b1

Let (ft) be a normal Loewner chain, G(z, t) the associated Herglotz vector ﬁeld and

Therefore, in order to get coeﬃcients sharp bound, one should try ﬁrst to reduce the
problem (if possible) to a simple problem involving the less possible numbers of coeﬃcients
of G, then ﬁnd a sharp bound for such coeﬃcients and solve the associated ODE.

F. BRACCI AND O. ROTH

We describe hereafter some methods which can be used in order to simplify the problem

and later some applications.

6. Operations in the class M

6.1. Decoupling harmonic terms. Let G(z) be a (autonomous) Herglotz vector ﬁeld
associated with the class M. Then

RehG(z), zi ≤ 0.
Such an inequality translates in terms of expansion as

It is easy to see that pv(ζ) = 1+ ˜pv(ζ) belongs to the Carath´eodory class, and in particular

Set z1 = xei(θ+η), z2 = yeiθ/m with x, y ≥ 0 and q1
equation

0,me−iη = |q1
x, y ≥ 0, x2 + y2 ≤ 1.

0,m| we obtain the equivalent

−x2 − y2 + |q1
0,m|xym ≤ 0,
Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, it is easy to check that the maximum for the
0,m|xym under the constraint x, y ≥ 0, x2 + y2 ≤ 1 is
function (x, y) 7→ −x2 − y2 + |q1
, y = q m
1√(1+m)
attained at the point x =
(1+m) , hence the previous inequality is satisﬁed

if and only if

Note that (8.1) gives the sharp bound for the coeﬃcients q1

0,m in the class M.
As before, for m = 2, from (5.1), (7.2) and (5.2) we have then, for all f ∈ S0

In particular, the map

Φ : (z1, z2) 7→ (z1 +

is a bounded support point. Note also that Φ is an automorphism of C2 and provides an
aﬃrmative answer to Question 4.1 for this special case of automorphisms.

This result, together with the germinal idea of decoupling harmonic terms, was proved

in [3].

Question 8.1. Is it true that

|b1

for all f ∈ S0 and m ∈ N, m ≥ 3? Note that if the bound is correct, it is sharp (consider
the function (z1 + umzm
