Dark photons ¯γ mediating long-range forces in a dark sector are predicted by various new physics
scenarios, and are being intensively searched for in experiments. We extend a previous study of a
new discovery process for dark photons proceedings via Higgs-boson production at the LHC. Thanks
to the non-decoupling properties of the Higgs boson, BR(H → γ¯γ) values up to a few percent
are possible for a massless dark photon, even for heavy dark-sector scenarios. The corresponding
signature consists (for a Higgs boson at rest) of a striking monochromatic photon with energy
Eγ = mH /2, and similar amount of missing energy. We perform a model independent analysis at
the LHC of both the gluon-fusion and VBF Higgs production mechanisms at 14 TeV, including
parton-shower eﬀects, and updating our previous parton-level analysis at 8 TeV in the gluon-fusion
channel by a more realistic background modeling. We ﬁnd that a 5σ sensitivity can be reached in the
gluon-fusion channel for BR(H → γ¯γ) (cid:39) 0.1% with an integrated luminosity of L (cid:39) 300 fb−1. The
corresponding VBF reach is instead restricted to 1%. Such decay rates can be naturally obtained
in dark-photon scenarios arising from unbroken U (1)F models explaining the origin and hierarchy
of the Yukawa couplings, strongly motivating the search for this exotic Higgs decay at the LHC.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Although long awaited, no conclusive signal of New
Physics (NP) at the TeV scale showed up in the ﬁrst
run of LHC at 7 and 8 TeV, and in the initial phase of
Run 2 at 13 TeV either. As a consequence, consents are
growing up around the idea that a new and unexplored
dark (or hidden) sector, weakly coupled to the standard
model (SM), is responsible for the observed dark matter
(DM). The latter, which is ﬁve times more abundant in
the Universe than ordinary baryonic matter [1], remains
still a mystery, with its constituents and detailed proper-
ties yet unknown. A dark sector could then have its in-
ternal structure and interactions, in complete agreement
with present astroparticle and cosmological observations.
It is also conceivable that a hidden sector could con-
tain an extra long-range force mediator among the dark
particles. The most simple example is provided by a new
unbroken U (1) gauge group, predicting a dark (or hid-
den) photon in its spectrum [2]. Dark-photon scenarios
have been extensively considered in the literature in the
framework of NP extensions of the SM gauge group [3]-
[7].

In cosmology, dark photons may help to solve the
small-scale structure formation problems. Massless dark
photons interacting with dark matter [8] can lead to the
formation of dark discs of galaxies [9], analogously to the
galaxy structure formation in the ordinary universe, or
to the collisional behavior of dark matter in mergers of
galaxies and galaxy clusters [10]. In astroparticle physics,
dark photons may induce the Sommerfeld enhancement
of DM annihilation cross section needed to explain the
PAMELA-Fermi-AMS2 positron anomaly [11] , as well

as assisting light-DM annihilations to make asymmetric
DM scenarios phenomenologically viable [12].
In some
scenarios, massive dark photons have also been consid-
ered as potential dark-matter candidates, with dedicated
experiments looking for their direct detection in the mass
range from a few eV up to 100 KeV [2],[13].

Most of present astrophysical and accelerator con-
straints apply to massive dark photons, and can be
evaded in the case of a massless dark-photon scenario, al-
lowing for potentially large dark-photon couplings in the
dark sector. Indeed, in the massless case, on-shell dark
photons can be fully decoupled from the SM quark and
lepton sector [3], which is not true for the massive case
due to the potential tree-level mixing with ordinary pho-
tons of massive dark photons. This property can lead to
observable new signatures at colliders for massless dark
photons, provided there is a messenger sector letting the
SM and dark sector communicate.

Recently, a massless dark photon scenario has been
foreseen in the framework of a theoretical proposal aimed
to naturally solve the ﬂavor hierarchy problem [14]. This
model predicts a new Higgs-boson decay channel into a
photon (γ) and a massless dark-photon (¯γ)

H → γ ¯γ ,

(1)

which is induced at one-loop. The ﬁnal ¯γ gives rise to
missing energy and momentum in the detector,
lead-
ing to an exotic resonant mono-photon signature at the
LHC. The latter features a distinctive photon transverse-
momentum (pγ
T ) distribution peaked around mH /2, same
for the missing transverse-energy ( /ET ) distribution, and
a γ¯γ transverse-mass distribution peaked around mH .
This exotic signature has been recently analyzed for the

ular, a parton-level analysis at the 8-TeV LHC has been
performed for the main Higgs-boson production channel,
namely the gluon fusion process. Using the full 8-TeV
LHC data set, a 5 σ sensitivity for a Higgs H → γ ¯γ
branching ratio (BR) down to 0.5% has been obtained.
These results have been worked out under assumptions
that might underestimate one of the main reducible back-
grounds, given by a photon plus jet (j), and did not in-
clude parton-shower eﬀects.

The purpose of the present paper is twofold. On the
one hand, we upgrade our previous 8-TeV analysis of the
H → γ¯γ decay in the main Higgs production channel
[15] by including parton-shower eﬀects to the previous
parton-level Montecarlo study of the signal and of SM
backgrounds. We also consider a more realistic back-
ground modeling, based on recent experimental stud-
ies of events with a photon plus missing energy at the
LHC [16]. We then extend the analysis to the upgraded
nominal LHC energy of 14 TeV. On the other hand, we
analyse for the ﬁrst time an alternative signature coming
from the H → γ¯γ decay for a Higgs boson produced via
the Vector-Boson-Fusion (VBF) mechanism. The gluon-
fusion channel will turn out to be the most sensitive to
BR(H → γ¯γ) (BRγ ¯γ). Nevertheless, we will see that the
VBF process could signiﬁcantly contribute to either a
measurement or a determination of upper bounds of the
decay rate of the exotic Higgs decay into a dark photon,
possibly giving an independent conﬁrmation of the sig-
nal in case of a positive observation in the gluon-fusion
process.

The plan of the paper is the following. In Sec. II, we de-
scribe a theoretical framework that might give rise to the
H → γ¯γ signature with observable rates. In Sec. III (A),
we study the potential of the gluon-fusion Higgs produc-
tion mechanism at the LHC for constraining the H → γ¯γ
rate, by a detailed analysis of both the signal and main
backgrounds. The same is done for the VBF production
mechanism in Sec. III (B). In Sec. IV, we summarize our
results and conclude.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

We now provide a model-independent parametrization
of the amplitude for the H → γ¯γ channel, and then dis-
cuss the corresponding BR’s range that can be expected
in a class of NP models that might explain the origin and
hierarchy of the Higgs Yukawa couplings.
The H → γ¯γ amplitude can be parametrized in a
model-independent way by requiring gauge invariance,
as follows

are the photon and dark-photon polarization vectors, re-
spectively. The corresponding decay width is given by

2

Γ(H → γ¯γ) = m3

H /(32 π Λ2

γ ¯γ).

(3)

A massless dark photon does not couple to SM particles
at tree level. One can then assume that the eﬀective
amplitude in Eq. (2) arises at one loop by the exchange
inside the loop of dark and messenger ﬁelds, the latter
being charged under both SM and extra U (1)F gauge in-
teractions. By naive dimensional analysis, one expects
the Λγ ¯γ scale be proportional to the mass of the heav-
iest particle running in the loop, presumably related to
the dark-sector. If this were the case, the chances of ob-
serving this process at the LHC would be dramatically
limited to a light dark-sector scenario, which is a quite
strong requirement. On the contrary, due to the non-
decoupling properties of the Higgs boson, this scale could
be proportional to the Higgs vacuum expectation value
(vev) (similarly to what happens for the H → γγ, γZ, gg
decay rates), which would allow for potentially large rates
regardless of the characteristic mass scale of the dark
sector. This crucial property turns out to hold in the
framework of the model proposed in [14], as has been
explicitly veriﬁed in [15]. This framework can then be
used as a benchmark model for computing all the rele-
vant quantities for predicting the Higgs decay rates into
dark photons.

In [14], the Flavor and Chiral Symmetry breaking
(ChSB) are assumed to be generated in a dark sector,
and transferred to the Higgs Yukawa sector at one loop
via Higgs-portal type scalar-messenger ﬁelds. A new ex-
act U (1)F gauge symmetry in the dark sector produces
via a nonperturbative mechanism an exponential spread
in the Yukawa couplings Yi (with i a ﬂavor index), provid-
ing a natural solution to the SM Flavor hierarchy prob-
lem. Apart from the gauge boson of the unbroken U (1)F
gauge group (the massless dark photon), the dark sector
consists of SM-singlet massive dark fermions, Qi, a sort
of rescaled replica of SM fermions. The requirement that
the gauge sector is unbroken allows dark fermions, which
have U (1)F charges, to be stable and thus potential dark-
matter candidates. In addition to the dark sector, there
are scalar messenger ﬁelds (with the same quantum num-
bers as the squarks and sleptons of supersymmetric mod-
els), which communicate the ChSB and Flavor breaking
from the dark sector to the Yukawa couplings.

By restricting, for instance, only to the contribution
of colored messenger ﬁelds, the eﬀective Λγ ¯γ scale can
then be exactly derived in the low energy limit [15]. In
particular, for a universal average messenger mass ¯m, one
obtains (up to corrections of order o(m2

H / ¯m2))

ing the left-right mixing of the messengers scalars, and
µS is the vev of a singlet scalar ﬁeld. The latter spon-
taneously breaks the H → −H parity symmetry needed
to forbid Higgs Yukawa interactions at tree level, since
Yukawa couplings are generated radiatively [14].

The non-decoupling properties of the Higgs boson
clearly show up in Eq.(4). Indeed, the eﬀective Λγ ¯γ scale
turns out to be proportional to the Higgs vev, that is
it tends to a ﬁnite value in the limit ¯m → ∞ (for ﬁxed
mixing parameter ξ < 1). As stressed in [15], this is a
general property of the Higgs boson, and does not depend
on the peculiar structure of the model in [14], provided
a messenger sector letting the SM and the dark sector
communicate exists.
The same oﬀ-shell ﬁelds contributing to the H → γ¯γ
decay amplitude at one loop can induce the H → ¯γ¯γ
transition to two dark photons (that increases the invisi-
ble Higgs decay width), and also give extra contributions
to the H → γγ, γZ, gg SM decay rates. By parametriz-
ing these eﬀects in a model independent way, BRγ ¯γ val-
ues up to 5% can be allowed, while respecting all other
LHC constraints [15]. Such large BR values for H → γ¯γ
are natural in the framework of the model in [14] (see
also [17] for further more model-dependent predictions).
Such high decay rates strongly motivated the study
of the Higgs production followed by the H → γ¯γ de-
cay at the LHC Run-1 energy and integrated luminosity
[15]. The corresponding signature is indeed quite dis-
tinctive, with an almost monochromatic and massless in-
visible (dark-photon) system and equally monochromatic
photon, jointly resonating at the Higgs mass.

In the present study, we will extend our previous analy-
sis to the 14-TeV LHC setup, upgrading diﬀerent aspects
of the study of the main gluon-fusion production channel,
and including VBF Higgs production in order to improve
the ﬁnal sensitivity to the H → γ¯γ signature.

III. PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

A. Gluon-fusion channel

We start by extending our previous LHC analysis of
the gluon-fusion process at 8 TeV [15] to 14 TeV, im-
proving the treatment of both the signal and the main
SM backgrounds. A crucial point in the reﬁnement of
most important backgrounds will be the use of recently
published experimental data by the CMS collaboration
[16], where the relevant SM backgrounds are measured
and reported. We will model our background accord-
ingly. All this will result in a higher reliability of our
signal and background estimates, that will anyhow sub-
stantially conﬁrm our previous results on discovery po-
tential based on a more naive analysis.

The process pp → H → γ¯γ, where the Higgs is pro-
duced in the gluon-fusion channel, is characterized by
a single photon recoiling against missing transverse mo-
mentum. In our previous analysis we outlined a search
strategy for this process, based on the following require-
ments (now slightly updated to take into account smear-
ing eﬀects discussed in the following):

• one isolated (∆R > 0.4) photon with pγ

T > 50 GeV,

and |ηγ| < 1.44;

• missing transverse momentum satisfying /ET >

50 GeV;

• transverse mass in the range 100 GeV < M T

γ ¯γ <

130 GeV;

• no isolated leptons.

(cid:113)

2pγ

The transverse-mass variable is deﬁned as M T

γ ¯γ =
T /ET (1 − cos ∆φ), where ∆φ is the azimuthal dis-
T , and

tance between the photon transverse momentum pγ
the missing transverse momentum /ET .
The main SM background for the above selection cri-
teria is pp → γj, where the missing transverse momen-
tum can arise from a) neutrinos following heavy-ﬂavor
decays in the jet, b) mismeasurement of the jet energy,
and c) very forward particles escaping the detector. To
the latter channel contributes also pp → jj, whenever
one of the jets is misidentiﬁed as a photon. We assume
the corresponding mis-tagging probability to be 0.1%.
Also, a photon identiﬁcation eﬃciency of 90% is adopted
throughout this analysis. In our previous study [15], the
hadronic SM background was estimated at parton level in
a quite crude way, by treating any parton with |η| > 4.0
as missing energy.

The CMS analysis of the data set at 8 TeV in [16] as-
sumes event selection criteria quite similar to the above,
in order to search for an exotic three-body decay of the
Higgs boson into a photon and two invisible particles.
Unfortunately, the CMS analysis imposes an upper limit
of 60 GeV on the photon transverse momentum, cutting
away an important fraction of the signal region for the

However, due to the similarity of the residual event se-
lection criteria in the two analysis, the continuous SM
backgrounds are expected to be comparable. As a con-
sequence, we decided to model our QCD background ac-
cording to the CMS measured distributions, beneﬁtting
from the highly optimized experimental procedure for the
missing transverse-momentum determination. This will
lead to a much improved reliability of our background
estimate in the gluon-fusion channel.

We started by simulating the γj and dijet backgrounds
with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO (v2.2.2) [18],
interfaced
with PYTHIA (v6.4.28) [19], hence including initial- and
ﬁnal-state radiation (ISR and FSR), hadronization and
detector-resolution eﬀects in the present updated analy-
sis. We have generated event samples both at 8 TeV and

14 TeV. We have then matched our 8-TeV samples to
the event yield corresponding to the ’SUSY benchmark’
event selection criteria reported in the CMS analysis [16].
This matching results in k-factors connecting our simu-
lated samples to experimental data at 8 TeV. We ﬁnd
k = 0.11 for the γ j background, and k = 0.058 for the
j → γ background. The order-of-magnitude reduction in
the background estimate reported by CMS as compared
to our simulation is to be understood as a result of CMS
advanced strategies for reducing event yields arising from
mis-measured missing transverse momentum in hadronic
events, as detailed in [16]. It is beyond the scope of this
work to attempt to exactly reproduce the CMS analysis.
Instead, we assume that the CMS optimization strategy
works with comparable eﬃciency also in 14-TeV colli-
sions, and that the corresponding reduction of the 14-
TeV hadronic SM backgrounds is reliably captured by
rescaling our simulated samples with the same k factors
obtained from the 8-TeV matching.
We also upgraded the simulation of H → γ¯γ sig-
nal events by including the ISR eﬀects. Accordingly,
we simulated Higgs production in association with ei-
ther one or no jets with ALPGEN (v2.14) [20], inter-
faced with PYTHIA for jet-parton matching, hadroniza-
tion and detector-resolution eﬀects (see Sec. III (B) for
the jet deﬁnition and other simulation details).
γ ¯γ spec-
tra for the H → γ¯γ signal is shown in Figure 1. There,
the two categories corresponding to no extra jets and
one extra jet accompanying the Higgs signal are shown
separatly, along with the distributions for the hadronic
backgrounds coming from γ j production, and dijet pro-
duction followed by j → γ mistagging. The latter distri-
butions are obtained with a nominal cut on the photon

The main electroweak background consists of the chan-

acceptance, and pp → Z(→ νν)γ. We have simulated
these processes at parton level according to the analysis
in [15] , using a e→ γ conversion probability of 0.005 for
the ﬁrst process.

process, and for SM backgrounds, for inclusive γ + /ET ﬁnal
states with no isolated leptons. The eﬀect of extra radiation
on the signal events is also depicted. All distributions are
normalized to unity.

This eﬀect has been actually mostly compensated by the
advanced optimization experimental strategies recently
applied to the missing transverse-momentum data, on
which we have now modeled our background simulation.
Assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 (300) fb−1
at 14 TeV, and extrapolating the eﬀect of these optimiza-
tion technique to higher energies, we ﬁnd a 5σ discovery
potential for BRγ ¯γ down to 1.6 × 10−3(9.2 × 10−4). At
the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), with an integrated
luminosity of 3 ab−1, the 5σ reach is extended down to
2.9 × 10−4.

In Table I, one can ﬁnd a summary of the cross sections
times acceptance (in fb) for the signal and backgrounds at
8 TeV and 14 TeV for the gluon-fusion process, assuming
BRγ ¯γ=1%, and obtained as discussed above.
With the 20 fb−1 data set at 8 TeV, our improved anal-
ysis gives a 5σ discovery reach at BRγ ¯γ (cid:39) 4.8 × 10−3,
compatible with our previous estimate [15]. The present
more-realistic event simulation was expected to deterio-
rate the capability of separating signal from background.

B. VBF channel

We now turn our focus on the Higgs production in
the VBF channel. This presents a lower production rate
with respect to the gluon-fusion channel. On the other
hand, it is in principle more controllable due to its strong
kinematical characterization. In particular, the process

opposite rapidity, one photon and missing transverse mo-
mentum.

We started by simulating the signal by PYTHIA, by
including both the Higgs VBF production and its subse-
quent decay into a γ¯γ ﬁnal state. The main SM back-
grounds are given by the production of QCD multi-jets,
γ+jets, and γ + Z(→ ¯νν)+jets. The γ+jets background
has been simulated using ALPGEN. We have generated
γj, γjj, and γjjj samples with pγ
T > 10 GeV and
|ηγ| < 2.5 for photons, and pj
T > 20 GeV and |ηj| < 5
for jets. An isolation of ∆R > 0.4 between all pairs of
objects is required. We have then interfaced ALPGEN
and PYTHIA, and incorporated the jet-parton matching,
according to the MLM prescription [21]. Events contain-
ing hard partons are generated in ALPGEN with a cut on
the transverse momentum (pT > 20 GeV), and on the ra-
pidity (|η| < 5.0) of each parton, along with a minimum
separation (∆R > 0.4) between them. These events are
then interfaced with PYTHIA for showering, to take into
account soft and collinear emission of partons. All par-
tons are then clustered using a cone jet algorithm with
pT > 20 GeV, and a cone size of ∆R = 0.6 (the latter
used only for matching purposes, not for the jet deﬁnition
in the event selection). An event is said to be matched
if there is a one-to-one correspondence between jets and
initial hard partons. An event with an extra jet which is
not matched to a parton is rejected in case of exclusive
matching, while is kept in case of inclusive matching for
the highest jet-multiplicity samples.

For the QCD multi-jet process and the γ +Z+ jets pro-
cess we have used MadGraph 5 interfaced with PYTHIA.
In case of the QCD multi-jet process, the most central
jet is assumed to be mistagged as a photon with a corre-
sponding faking probability of 0.1%. The ISR and FSR
eﬀects, parton shower, hadronisation and ﬁnite detector
resolution eﬀects have also been implemented for the sig-
nal and all backgrounds. We have then assumed a photon
identiﬁcation eﬃciency of 90%. The distributions are ob-
tained with a nominal cut on the photon transverse mo-
mentum, pγ

In Figures 2 and 3, we plot a few kinematic distribu-
tions which are useful to separate the signal from the
backgrounds.

On this basis, we propose to select the events according

to the following criteria:

• (basic cut) no isolated leptons;
• (rapidity cuts) rapidities of the two highest pT jets

• (M T

ible system satisfying 100 GeV < M T
γ ¯γ < 130 GeV
(as above, the upper bound has been extended with
respect to mH to take into account the smearing of
the M T

signiﬁcance.
Table III presents the independent eﬀect of the y∗ and
∆φ(ji, /ET ) cuts, applied after the set of cuts listed in
Table II. The combined eﬀect of these two cuts is also
shown in the last row of Table III. The ∆φ(ji, /ET ) cut
turns out to be much more eﬀective in separating the
signal from background. We then dropped the y∗ cut in
our ﬁnal selection.

Since the ∆φ(ji, /ET ) distribution is asymmetric in the
exchange of the ﬁrst and second highest-pT jets, we have
also tried to optimize the signal signiﬁcance by assuming
an asymmetric cut on ∆φ(ji, /ET ), that is by applying
diﬀerent cuts on the ﬁrst and second highest-pT jets. We
anyway found that the best signal to background ratio
is obtained with the symmetric cut ∆φ(ji, /ET ) > 1.5 on
both jets.
Finally, assuming an integrated luminosity of 300 fb−1,
in the last column of Table III we present the estimated
VBF signal signiﬁcances for BRγ ¯γ=1%. For this setup,
the signal signiﬁcance S/
S + B approaches the 5σ level.
For 100 fb−1, the 5σ reach in branching ratio is about
BRγ ¯γ(cid:39) 2%. With the HL-LHC integrated luminosity of
3 ab−1, the 5σ reach can be extended down to BRγ ¯γ =
3.4 × 10−3.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the prospects for discovering an ex-
otic Higgs-boson decay into a SM photon and a new neu-
tral massless vector boson, a dark photon, at the LHC
with
S = 14 TeV. We have updated our previous anal-

signal and SM backgrounds in the γ+ /ET +(≥ 2)jets ﬁnal state
with no isolated leptons. The ∆η = |ηj1 − ηj2| distribution is
obtained with a cut pγ

fake jet in the QCD multijets analysis, and /ET > 30 GeV. The
transverse mass distribution is obtained with the additional
cuts ηj1 × ηj2 < 0 and |ηj1 − ηj2| > 4.0. All distributions are
normalized to unity.

In Table II, we present the cross sections for the signal
and dominant SM backgrounds after the sequential ap-
plication of basic cuts, rapidity cuts on the two forward
jets, and transverse-mass cut on the photon plus missing
transverse-energy system.

In order to better control the missing transverse en-
ergy arising from jet energy mis-measurements, we have
also imposed an azimuthal isolation cut ∆φ(ji, /ET ) > 1.5
(with i = 1, 2) on the angles between the /ET direction
and the transverse momenta of the two highest-pT jets.
Furthermore, we studied the eﬀect of a selection cut
occasionally applied for searches in the VBF channel
(see, e.g., the W → (cid:96)ν analysis in VBF in [22]). This
is the y∗ < 1.0 cut on the Zeppenfeld variable deﬁned
as y∗ = |yH − 1
2 (ηj1 − ηj2)|, where the Higgs rapidity
yH is reconstructed from the photon momentum and the
missing transverse energy as described in [23]. X sys-
tems produced via VBF are in fact characterized by a
smaller y∗ value, with respect to other X+2-jet back-

ysis of the gluon-fusion channel at 8 TeV by a more
reliable treatment of both the signal and hadronic SM
backgrounds, and extended this approach to 14-TeV col-
lisions. We also explored for the ﬁrst time the possibility
of detecting the exotic H → γ ¯γ channel in the VBF Higgs
production.

A summary of our ﬁndings is presented in Table IV,
where we show the predicted reach in detectable BRγ ¯γ
for both exclusion (at a 3σ level) and discovery (at a
5σ level), assuming 100, 300 and 3000 fb−1 of data at
14 TeV. The gluon-fusion potential turns out to be def-
initely higher, extending the BRγ ¯γ reach with respect
to the VBF channel by more than one order of magni-
tude.
In particular, according to the present analysis,
the full LHC program will allow to discover (exclude) a
BRγ ¯γ value down to less than 1 × 10−3 (6 × 10−4), while
the HL-LHC phase will be sensitive to BRγ ¯γ as small as
3 × 10−4 (2 × 10−4). We recall that BRγ ¯γ values up to
5% are allowed in realistic BSM frameworks [15].

In light of the projected discovery reach and of the
theoretical interest in dark-photon models, we urge the
ATLAS and CMS experiments to perform a dedicated
analysis of the H → γ + /ET signature in two-body ﬁ-
nal states. The event selection criteria used in the CMS
analysis [16], by imposing an upper limit of 60 GeV on
pγ
T , considerably restrict the signal phase space for the
two-body decay mode. Nevertheless, the methods used

by CMS for the suppression of the SM hadronic back-
grounds to the /ET signature can be very eﬀective even
for relatively low transverse-momentum ﬁnal states, pos-
sibly resulting in experimental sensitivities for branching
ratios well below the permil level. Similar methods could
actually be applied (once the corresponding experimental
analyzes will be available) for suppressing the SM multi-
jet background to the VBF channel, possibly increasing
the relative weight of the VBF analysis in the search for a
H → γ¯γ signature, hence expanding the LHC potential.
After the recent observation at the LHC of an excess
in the di-photon spectrum around an invariant mass of
about 750 GeV [24, 25], it would be also advisable to ex-
tend the search for γ + /ET ﬁnal states to higher invariant
masses of the γ¯γ pair. Indeed, the observed features of
the would-be 750-GeV γγ resonance might require new
degrees of freedom in a hidden sector in order to give rise
to eﬀective couplings to photons (and gluons) (see,e.g.,
[26]). The latter degrees of freedom could well be portals
to a massless dark photon, in case they are also charged
under an extra unbroken U (1)F . Since a large U (1)F cou-
pling might be naturally allowed [17], the corresponding
rate for a γ¯γ resonance at 750 GeV could already be siz-
able with the present data set. This possibility has also
been envisaged in [27].

In case the di-photon signature will be conﬁrmed at
the LHC, the search for new structures in the γ + /ET
transverse-mass distributions at 750 GeV would provide
extra invaluable insight about the nature of the NP be-
hind it.
