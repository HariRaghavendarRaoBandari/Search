Movability and co-movability of shape morphisms

P.S.Gevorgyan and I.Pop

Abstract

The purpose of this paper is to deﬁne some notions of movability for mor-
phisms of inverse systems which extend the movability properties of inverse sys-
tems and which are compatible with the equivalence relations which deﬁne pro-
morphisms and shape morphisms. Some properties, examples and applications
are given.

Introduction

The notion of movability for metric compacta was introduced by K. Borsuk [2] as an
important shape invariant. The movable spaces are a generalization of spaces having
the shape of ANR’s. The movability assumption allows a series of important results in
algebraic topology (like the Whitehead and Hurewicz theorems) to remain valid when
the homotopy pro-groups are replaced by the corresponding shape groups. The term
”movability” comes from the geometric interpretation of the deﬁnition in the compact
case:
if X is a compactum lying in a space M ∈ AR, one says that X is movable if
for every neighborhood U of X in M there exists a neighborhood V ⊂ U of X such
that for every neighborhood W ⊂ U of X there is a homotopy H : V × [0, 1] → U
such that H(x, 0) = x and H(x, 1) ∈ W for every x ∈ V . One shows that the choice of
M ∈ AR is irrelevant [2]. After the notion of movability had been expressed in terms of
ANR-systems, for arbitrary topological spaces, [10], [11], it became clear that one could
deﬁne it in arbitrary pro-categories. The deﬁnition of a movable object in an arbitrary
pro-category and that of uniform movability were both given by Maria Moszy´nska
[13]. Uniform movability is important in the study of mono- and epi-morphisms in
pro-categories and in the study of the shape of pointed spaces. In the book of Sibe
Mardeˇsi´c and Jack Segal [11] all these approaches and applications of various types of
movability are discussed.

Some categorical approaches to movability in shape theory were given by P.S.Gevorgyan

[7], I. Pop [14], P.S. Gevorgyan & I. Pop [8], T.A. Avakyan & P.S. Gevorgyan [1].

The approach of this paper started from the idea that some results in shape theory,
valid in some conditions of movability for inverse systems or shape objects, could be
obtained in weak conditions. More precisely, the idea was to deﬁne some movability
notions for the morphisms of inverse systems, so as, when these morphisms are identity
morphisms, the deﬁnitions of the usual movability properties to be found both for pro-
objects and shape objects. Besides the classic case of movability pro-objects and shape
objects, some notions of movability appear in the papers of T. Yagasaki about the study
of the shape ﬁbrations [18] and [19], in a paper of Z. ˇCerin on Lefschetz movable maps
[3], and in a paper of D. A. Edwards and P. Tulley MacAuley about a shape theory of
a map [6]. Unfortunately, these approaches are just particular cases and they do not
deal with the movability of shape morphisms in the general case of an abstract shape
theory. But the second author of this paper already approached this problem in two
previous article [15] and [16] in which some properties of movability for morphisms of
inverse systems and for pro-morphisms were deﬁned and studied. But those properties
of movability could not be extended to shape morphisms and maps. In the present paper
this problem is solved by a slight but useful modiﬁcation of the notions of movability
and uniform movability for morphisms of inverse systems previously proposed, the
new deﬁnitions becoming compatible with the relations which deﬁne the pro-morphism
and shape morphism. In this way we obtain some satisfactory notions of movability
(simple, strong or uniform) for shape morphisms and particularly for maps. Some
”dual” notions, namely that of co-movability (simple, strong or uniform), are deﬁned.
Some properties, examples and applications are given.

2 Movable and strong movable morphisms of in-

verse systems and pro-morphisms

All sets of indices are supposed to be coﬁnite directed sets. This condition is not
restrictive (cf.[11], Ch.I,§1.2).

First we recall from [11],Ch. II, §6.1 the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.1. An object X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) of pro-C is movable provided every λ ∈ Λ
admits a λ′ ≥ λ (called a movability index of λ) such that each λ′′ ≥ λ admits a
morphism r : Xλ′ → Xλ′′ of C which satisﬁes

pλλ′′ ◦ r = pλλ′,

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′ , M) inverse systems in a the
category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y a morphism of inverse systems. We say that the
morphism (fµ, φ) is movable if every µ ∈ M admits λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ), such that each
µ′ ∈ M, µ′ ≥ µ, admits a morphism u : Xλ → Yµ′, in the category C, which satisﬁes

fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ = qµµ′ ◦ u

(2.2)

i.e., makes the following diagram commutative

The index λ is called a movability index (MI) of µ with respect to the morphism (fµ, φ).
The composition fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ, for λ ≥ φ(µ) is denoted by fµλ (cf.[11], Ch.II,§2.1). By

this notation the relation (2.2) becomes

fµλ = qµµ′ ◦ u.

Remark 2.3. If λ is a movability index for µ with respect to (fµ, φ), then any eλ > λ
has this property.
Example 2.4. Let (X) be a rudimentary system in the category C and (fµ) : (X) →
Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) a morphism of inverse systems. Then (fµ) is movable. Indeed, we
have fµ = qµµ′ ◦ fµ′.

More generally, if we consider a morphism (fµ, φ) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y =
(Yµ, qµµ′, M) such that there exists λM ∈ Λ satisfying λM ≥ φ(µ) for any µ ∈ M,
then (fµ, φ) is movable. Indeed, for an arbitrary index µ ∈ M and µ′ ≥ µ we have
fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λM = qµµ′ ◦ fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λM = qµµ′ ◦ u, where u = fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λM is a morphism from
XλM to Yµ′. So, λM is a movability index.

Theorem 2.5. An inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) is movable if and only if the
identity morphism 1X is movable.

Proof. Let an inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) be movable. Consider an arbitrary
λ ∈ Λ. Note that a movability index λ′ ≥ λ is also a movability index of λ with respect
to 1X : X → X.

Conversely, let 1X : X → X be a movable morphism. Note that for any λ ∈ Λ
a movability index λ′ ≥ λ of λ with respect to 1X is also a movability index for the
inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ).

Theorem 2.6. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ), Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be inverse
systems in the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y, (gν, ψ) : Y → Z morphisms of
inverse systems. Suppose that (gν, ψ) is movable. Then the composition (hν, χ) =
(gν, ψ) ◦ (fµ, φ) is also a movable morphism.

Proof. Recall that we have χ = φ ◦ ψ and hν = gν ◦ fψ(ν). If (gν, ψ) is movable and
ν ∈ N, then for a movability index of ν ∈ N, µ ∈ M, with µ ≥ ψ(ν), an index ν ′ ∈ N,
with ν ′ ≥ ν admits a morphism in C, u : Yµ → Zν ′ such that gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ = rνν ′ ◦ u

Now consider λ ∈ Λ with λ ≥ φ(µ), λ ≥ φ(ψ(ν)) such that fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ =
qψ(ν)µ ◦ fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ. Then we can consider the morphism u′ := u ◦ fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ : Xλ → Zν ′.
For this morphism we obtain: rνν ′ ◦ u′ = (rνν ′ ◦ u) ◦ fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ = gν ◦ qψ(ν) ◦ fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ =
gν ◦ fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν)) = hν ◦ pχ(ν)λ.

Corollary 2.7. Let an inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) be arbitrary and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M)
be movable. Then any morphism (fµ, φ) : X → Y is movable.

Proof. Since (fµ, φ) = 1Y ◦ (fµ, φ) and 1Y : Y → Y is a movable morphism by Theorem
2.5, then (fµ, φ) is also movable according to Theorem 2.6.

Theorem 2.8. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ), Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be inverse
systems in the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y, (gν, ψ) : Y → Z morphisms of inverse
systems. Suppose that (fµ, φ) is movable. Then the composition (hν , χ) = (gν, ψ)◦(fµ, φ)
is also a movable morphism.

Proof. For an arbitrary index ν ∈ N, consider a movability index λ of ψ(ν), λ ≥
φ(ψ(ν)), with respect to (fµ, φ). Let us prove that λ is a movability index of ν with
respect to the morphism (hν, χ).

Let ν ′ ∈ N, ν ′ ≥ ν be any index. Consider µ′ ≥ ψ(ν ′), ψ(ν), and such that

rνν ′ ◦ gν ′ ◦ qψ(ν ′)µ′ = gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ′ .

For qψ(ν)µ′ by the movability of (fµ, φ) : X → Y there exists a morphism u : Xλ →

Yµ′ such that

fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ = qψ(ν)µ′ ◦ u,

and deﬁne U : Xλ → Zν ′, by

U = gν ′ ◦ qψ(ν ′)µ′ ◦ u.

Now we have: rνν ′ ◦U = rνν ′ ◦gν ′ ◦qψ(ν ′)µ′ ◦u = gν ◦qψ(ν)µ′ ◦u = gν ◦qψ(ν)µ ◦fµ ◦pφ(µ)λ =

gν ◦ fψ(ν) ◦ pχ(ν)λ = hν ◦ pχ(ν)λ.

Corollary 2.9. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) be movable and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be arbitrary
inverse system. Then any morphism (fµ, φ) : X → Y is movable.

Proof. Since (fµ, φ) = (fµ, φ) ◦ 1X and 1X : X → X is a movable morphism by Theorem
2.5, then (fµ, φ) is also movable according to Theorem 2.8.

Proposition 2.10. Let (fµ, φ), (f ′
equivalent morphisms of inverse systems, (fµ, φ) ∼ (f ′
movable then the morphism (f ′

µ, φ′) is also movable.

µ, φ′) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be two
µ, φ′). If the morphism (fµ, φ) is

Proof. Let µ ∈ M with λ a movability index for µ with respect to the morphism (fµ, φ).
Now by the deﬁnition of the equivalence relation between morphisms of inverse systems
(see [11],Ch.I,§1.1), for the index µ there exist an index λ′ ≥ φ(µ), φ′(µ) such that

fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ′ = f ′

µ ◦ pφ′(µ)λ′ ,

(2.3)

and we can suppose that λ′ ≥ λ, such that we refer at λ′ as a movability index of µ
with respect to (fµ, φ). Then we can prove that λ′ is also a movability index for µ with
respect to the morphism (f ′
µ, φ′). Let be µ′ ∈ M, µ′ ≥ µ. Then there exists a morphism
u : Xλ′ → Yµ′ such that fµλ′ = qµµ′ ◦ u,

But by relation (2.3) we have that fµλ′ = f ′

µλ′ such that f ′

µλ′ = qµµ′ ◦ u.

Recall that the pro-category pro-C of a category C has as objects all inverse systems
X in C (over all directed sets Λ) and as morphisms f : X → Y the equivalence classes of
morphisms of inverse systems (fµ, φ) : X → Y with respect to the equivalence relation
∼ above considered. Thanks to Proposition 2.10 we can give the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.11. A morphism in a pro-category pro-C, f : X → Y, is called movable
if f admits a representation (fµ, φ) : X → Y which is movable.

The next theorem follows from Theorems 2.6, 2.8 and Corollaries 2.7, 2.9.

Theorem 2.12. A composition of an arbitrary pro-morphism at right or left with a
movable pro-morphism is a movable pro-morphism. Particularly, if for a pro-morphism
f : X → Y, one of X or Y is a movable system, then f is a movable pro-morphism.

Corollary 2.13. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) in pro-C. If Y is movable
and X is dominated by Y in pro-C, X ≤ Y, then X is also movable.

Proof. By assumption there exist the pro-morphisms f : X → Y and g : Y → X such
that g ◦ f = 1X. Because Y is movable, by Theorem 2.12 it follows that f, g and 1X
are movable pro-morphisms and hence, X is movable by Theorem 2.5.

Remark 2.14. Corollary 2.13 is a new proof of an important result in the theory of
shape (see [11] Theorem 1, Ch. II, §6.1).

Deﬁnition 2.15. A morphism of inverse systems (fµ, φ) : ((Xλ, ∗), pλλ′, Λ) → ((Yµ, ∗), qµµ′, M)
of pointed sets is said to have the Mittag-Leﬄer property provided every µ ∈ M ad-
mits a λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ) (an ML index for µ with respect to (fµ, φ), such that for any
λ′ ∈ Λ, λ′ ≥ λ one has

fµλ′(Xλ′) = fµλ(Xλ).

(2.4)

If (fµ, φ) is replaced by 1(X,∗) we obtain the Mittag-Leﬄer property for an inverse

system in the category pro-Set∗ (cf.[11],Ch. II, §6.2).

The same condition deﬁnes the Mittag-Leﬄer property for a morphism of pro-

groups.

Proposition 2.16. A morphism of inverse systems of pointed sets with the Mittag-
Leﬄer property is movable.

Proof. Let (fµ, φ) : ((Xλ, ∗), pλλ′, Λ) → ((Yµ, ∗), qµµ′, M) with the Mittag-Leﬄer prop-
erty. Then for µ ∈ M there is an ML index λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ) such that (2.4) holds for
each λ′ ≥ λ. We can prove that λ is a movability index for µ with respect to (fµ, φ).
For µ′ ∈ M, µ′ ≥ µ, consider λ′ ∈ Λ satisfying the conditions λ′ ≥ λ ≥ φ(µ), λ′ ≥ φ(µ′)
and

qµµ′ ◦ fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ′ = fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ′ ,

i.e.,

(2.5)
Then since λ′ ≥ λ we have also satisﬁed (2.4). This last relation implies the existence
of a function r : (Xλ, ∗) → (Xλ′, ∗) satisfying

qµµ′ ◦ fµ′λ′ = fµλ′.

fµλ′ ◦ r = fµλ.

(2.6)

Now from the relations (2.5), (2.6) we have: fµλ = qµµ′ ◦ fµ′λ′ ◦ r, so that we denote
u := fµ′λ′ ◦ r : (Xλ, ∗) → (Yµ′, ∗), we have

which is the movability condition.

fµλ = qµµ′ ◦ u,

6

Proposition 2.17. Consider in the category Grp of groups an inverse system G =
(Gλ, qλλ′, Λ) and in the category F of free groups an inverse systems F = (Fλ, pλλ′, Λ)
such that there exists a level morphism of inverse systems (fλ) : F → G with every
morphism fλ : Fλ → Gλ an epimorphism in Grp. Then if (fλ) is a movable as a
morphism in pro-Set∗, it is movable in pro-Grp.

Proof. Let for λ ∈ Λ a movability index λ′ with respect to (fλ) in pro-Set∗. If λ′′ ≥ λ,
then there exists a function r : Fλ′ → Gλ′′ satisfying fλ ◦ pλλ′ = qλλ′′ ◦ r. If B is a
basis for Fλ′ then there exists a homomorphism u : Fλ′ → Gλ′′ such that u|B = r|B.
Then the homomorphisms fλ ◦ pλλ′ and qλλ′′ ◦ u coincide on B and therefore they are
equal.

For a new property of movability for morphisms of inverse systems we recall from

[11],Ch. II, §9.3 the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.18. An object X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) ∈ pro-C is called strongly movable
provided every λ ∈ Λ admits a λ′ ≥ λ (a strong movability index of λ) such that for
every λ′′ ≥ λ there exist a λ∗ ≥ λ′, λ′′ and a morphism r : Xλ′ → Xλ′′ satisfying

pλλ′′ ◦ r = pλλ′,

r ◦ pλ′λ∗ = pλ′′λ∗,

Obviously that strong movability implies movability of an inverse system.

Deﬁnition 2.19. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′ , M) inverse systems in a
the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y a morphism of inverse systems. We say that
the morphism (fµ, φ) is strongly movable if every µ ∈ M admits(λ ≥ φ(µ)), a strong
movability index of µ with respect to (fµ, φ) such that every µ′ ≥ µ exists a λ∗ ≥ λ, φ(µ′)
and a morphism u : Xλ → Yµ′ satisfying

qµµ′ ◦ u = fµλ,

Obviously that strong movability of morphisms implies movability.

Remark 2.20. An inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) is strongly movable if and only if
the identity morphism 1X is strongly movable.

Proposition 2.21. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ), Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be
inverse systems in the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y, (gν, ψ) : Y → Z morphisms
of inverse systems. Suppose that (gν, ψ) is strongly movable. Then the composition
(hν, χ) = (gν, ψ) ◦ (fµ, φ) is also a strongly movable morphism.

Proof. We use the notations and the results from the proof of Theorem 2.6. Suppose
that for the morphism u : Yµ′ → Zν ′ there exists µ∗ ≥ µ, ψ(ν ′) such that we have
u ◦ qµµ∗ = gν ′µ∗. Consider λ∗ ≥ λ, φ(µ∗), χ(ν) = φ(ψ(ν)). Then for the morphism
u′ = u ◦ fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ : Xλ′ → Zν ′ we have: u′ ◦ pλλ∗ = u ◦ fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ ◦ pλλ∗ = u ◦ fµ ◦
pφ(µ)λ∗ = u ◦ qµ′µ∗ ◦ fµ∗ ◦ pφ(µ∗)λ∗ = gν ′′µ∗ ◦ fµ∗ ◦ pφ(µ∗)λ∗ = gν ′ ◦ qψ(ν ′)µ∗ ◦ fµ∗ ◦ pφ(µ∗)λ∗ =
gν ′ ◦ fψ(ν ′) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν ′))λ∗ = hν ′λ∗.

Proposition 2.22. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ), Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be
inverse systems in the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y , (gν, ψ) : Y → Z morphisms
of inverse systems. Suppose that (fµ, φ) is strongly movable. Then the composition
(hν, χ) = (gν, ψ) ◦ (fµ, φ) is also a strongly movable morphism.

Particularly, if X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) is a strongly movable system, then any morphism

(fµ, φ) : X → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) is a strongly movable morphism.

Proof. We use the notations and the results from the proof of Theorem 2.8.Suppose
that for the morphism u : Xλ → Yµ′ there exists λ∗ ≥ λ, φ(µ′), φ(ψ(ν ′)), such that
u ◦ pλλ∗ = fµ′λ∗. Then for the morphism U : Xλ → Zν ′ we have U ◦ pλλ∗ = gν ′ ◦ qψ(ν ′)µ′ ◦
u ◦ pλλ∗ = gν ′ ◦ qψ(ν ′)µ′ ◦ fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ∗ = gν ′ ◦ fψ(ν ′) ◦ pχ(ν ′)λ∗ = hν ′λ∗.

Proposition 2.23. Let (fµ, φ), (f ′
equivalent morphisms of inverse systems, (fµ, φ) ∼ (f ′
strongly movable then the morphism (f ′

µ, φ′) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be two
µ, φ′). If the morphism (fµ, φ) is

µ, φ′) is also strongly movable.

Proof. We use the notations and the results from the proof of Proposition 2.10. Suppose
that for the morphism u : Xλ′ → Yµ′ there exists λ∗ ≥ λ, φ(µ′) such that u◦pλλ∗ = fµ′λ∗.
Consider λ∗ ≥ φ(µ′), φ′(µ′), λ∗ such that f ′
µ′ ◦ pφ′(µ′)λ∗. Then we have
u ◦ pλλ∗ = f ′

µ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ∗ = f ′

Thanks to Proposition 2.23 we can give the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.24. A morphism in a pro-category pro-C, f : X → Y, is called strongly
movable if f admits a representation (fµ, φ) : X → Y which is strongly movable.

Remark 2.25. Using Propositions 2.21 and 2.22 one can prove Corollaries 2.7, 2.9 and
2.13 replacing the property of movability by the property of strong movability for pro-
morphisms.

3 Uniformly movable pro-morphisms

First we recall from [11], Ch. II, §6.1 the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.1. An object X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) ∈ pro-C is called uniformly movable if
every λ ∈ Λ admits a λ′ ≥ λ(a uniform movability index of λ) such that there is a
morphism r : Xλ′ → X in pro-C satisfying

pλλ′ = pλ ◦ r

(3.1)

where pλ : X → Xλ is the morphism of pro-C given by 1λ : Xλ → Xλ, i.e., pλ is the
restriction of X to Xλ. Consequently, pλλ′ factors through X.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be inverse systems in
a category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y a morphism of inverse systems. We say that the
morphism (fµ, φ) is uniformly movable if every µ ∈ M admits λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ) (called
a uniform movability index of µ with respect to (fµ, φ))such that there is a morphism
of inverse systems u : Xλ → Y satisfying

fµλ = qµ ◦ u

i.e., the following diagram commutes

where qµ : Y → Yµ is the morphism of inverse systems given by 1µ : Yµ → Yµ.

Remark 3.3. If λ is a uniform movability index, then any eλ > λ has this property.

Remark 3.4. Note that the morphism u : Xλ → Y determines for every µ1 ∈ M a
morphism uµ1 : Xλ → Yµ1 in C such that for µ1 ≤ µ2 we have qµ1µ2 ◦ uµ2 = uµ1 and
uµ = fµλ. In particular, for µ′ ∈ M, µ′ ≥ µ, we have qµµ′ ◦ uµ′ = uµ = fµλ, so that
uniform movability of morphisms implies movability.

Example 3.5. If (X) is a rudimentary system in the category C then any morphism of
inverse systems (fµ) : (X) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) in the category C is uniformly movable
because fµ ◦ 1X = qµ ◦ (fµ).More generally, if we consider a morphism (fµ, φ) : X =
(Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) such that there exists λM ∈ Λ satisfying λM ≥ φ(µ)
for any µ ∈ M, then (fµ, φ) is uniformly movable. Indeed, for an arbitrary index µ ∈ M,
a uniformly movable index is λM , with fµλM = qµ ◦ u, where u : XλM → Y is deﬁned
by the components uµ′ : XλM → Yµ′ given by uµ′ = fµ′λM .

Theorem 3.6. An inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) is uniformly movable if and only
if the identity morphism 1X is uniformly movable.

Proof. Let an inverse X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) be uniformly movable. Consider an arbitrary
λ ∈ Λ. Note that a uniform movability index λ′ ≥ λ is also a uniform movability index
of λ with respect to 1X : X → X.

Conversely, let 1X : X → X be uniformly movable morphism. Note that for any
λ ∈ Λ a uniform movability index λ′ ≥ λ of λ with respect to 1X is also a uniform
movability index for the inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ).

Theorem 3.7. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ), Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be inverse
systems in the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y, (gν, ψ) : Y → Z morphisms of inverse
systems. Then, if (gν, ψ) is uniformly movable, the composition (hν, χ) = (gν, ψ)◦(fµ, φ)
is also a uniformly movable morphism.

Proof. We use the notations from the proof of Theorem 2.6 replacing rνν ′ : Zν ′ → Zν
by rν : Z → Zν and u : Yµ → Zν ′ by u : Yµ → Z. Then we have gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ = rν ◦ u.
And by deﬁning u′ = u ◦ fµλ : Xλ → Z, we obtain rν ◦ u′ = hνλ.

Corollary 3.8. Let an inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) be arbitrary and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M)
be uniformly movable. Then any morphism (fµ, φ) : X → Y is uniformly movable.

Proof. Since (fµ, φ) = 1Y ◦ (fµ, φ) and 1Y : Y → Y is uniformly movable by Theorem
3.6, then (fµ, φ) is also uniformly movable according to Theorem 3.7.

Theorem 3.9. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ), Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be inverse
systems in the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y, (gν, ψ) : Y → Z morphisms of
inverse systems. Suppose that (fµ, φ) is uniformly movable. Then the composition
(hν, χ) = (gν, ψ) ◦ (fµ, φ) is also a uniformly movable morphism.

Proof. Using the notations from the proof of Theorem 2.8, there exists u : Xλ → Y,
such that fψ(ν)λ = qψ(ν) ◦u. Then for U : Xλ → Z,U = g◦u, we have hνλ = gν ◦fψ(ν)λ =
rν ◦ U.

Corollary 3.10. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) be uniformly movable and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be
arbitrary inverse system. Then any morphism (fµ, φ) : X → Y is uniformly movable.

Proof. Since (fµ, φ) = (fµ, φ) ◦ 1X and 1X : X → X is uniformly movable by Theorem
3.6, then (fµ, φ) is also uniformly movable according to Theorem 3.9.

Proposition 3.11. Let (fµ, φ), (f ′
equivalent morphisms of inverse systems, (fµ, φ) ∼ (f ′
uniformly movable then the morphism (f ′

µ, φ′) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be two
µ, φ′). If the morphism (fµ, φ) is

µ, φ′) is also uniformly movable.

Proof. We use the notations from the proof of Proposition 2.10. For µ ∈ M consider
λ′ ∈ Λ a uniform movability index with respect to (fµ, φ) such that the relation (2.3)
holds. This means fµλ′ = f ′

µλ′ and therefore f ′

µλ′ = fµλ′ = qµ ◦ u.

Thanks to Proposition 3.11 we can give the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.12. A morphism in a pro-category pro-C, f : X → Y, is called uniformly
movable if f admits a representation (fµ, φ) : X → Y which is uniformly movable.

The next theorem follows from Theorems 3.7, 3.9 and Corollaries 3.8, 3.10.

Theorem 3.13. A composition of an arbitrary pro-morphism at right or left with a
uniformly movable pro-morphism is a uniformly movable pro-morphism. Particularly,
if for a pro-morphism f :X → Y, one of X or Y is a uniformly movable system, then
f is a uniformly movable pro-morphism.

Corollary 3.14. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) in pro-C. If Y is uni-
formly movable and X is dominated by Y in pro-C, X ≤ Y, then X is uniformly
movable.

Proof. By assumption there exist the pro-morphisms f : X → Y and g : Y → X such
that g ◦ f = 1X. Because Y is uniformly movable, by Theorem 3.13 it follows that f,
g and 1X are uniformly movable pro-morphisms and hence, X is uniformly movable by
Theorem 3.6.

Remark 3.15. Corollary 3.14 is a new proof of an important result in the theory of
shape (see [11], Theorem 2, Ch. II, §6.1).

Corollary 3.16. Let f : X → Y be a pro-morphism with X an arbitrary inverse system
and Y = (Yn, qnn+1) an inverse sequence. Suppose that f is movable with a right inverse.
Then f is uniformly movable.

Proof. By Theorems 2.12, 2.5, Y is movable. Then by [11], Ch. II, §6.2, Theorem 4,
Y is uniformly movable and ﬁnally, by Theorem 3.13 the pro-morphism f is uniformly
movable.

Remark 3.17. If F : C → D is a covariant functor and f = [(fµ, φ)] : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) →
Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) is a morphism in pro-C, then the morphism F (f) = [(F (fµ), φ)] :
F (X) = (F (Xλ), F (pλλ′), Λ) → F (Y) = (F (Yµ), F (qµµ′), M) is well deﬁned and if f is
(strongly, uniformly) movable then F (f) is (strongly, uniformly) movable. For example,
if f : (X, ∗) → (Y, ∗) is a (strongly,uniformly) movable pro-morphism in HPol∗ then
π1(f) : π1(X, ∗) → π1(Y, ∗) is a (strongly, uniformly) movable pro-groups morphism.

4 Movable, strongly movable and uniformly mov-

able shape morphisms

At ﬁrst we recall some notions on abstract shape theory (cf.[11], Ch.I, §2.1).

Let T be a category and P a subcategory of T . For an object X ∈ T , a T -
expansion of X (with respect to P) is a morphism in pro-T of X to an inverse system
X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) in T , p : X → X (X viewed as a rudimentary system (X)), with the
following universal property:

For any inverse system Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) in the subcategory P (called a P-system)and
any morphism h : X → Y in pro-T , there exists a unique morphism f : X → Y in
pro-T such that h = f ◦ p , i.e., the following diagram commutes.

X

p

Is said that p is a P-expansion of X provided X and f are in pro-P. This case is of
particular interest in shape theory.

If p : X → X, p′ : X → X′ are two P-expansion of the same object X, then there

is a unique natural isomorphism i : X → X′ such that i ◦ p = p′.

Let T be a category and P a subcategory. Is said that P is dense in the category T
provided every object X ∈ T admits a P-expansion p : X → X. In [11] Ch.I, §2.2, is
proved a theorem which characterizes dense subcategories. For a pair (T , P) consisting
by a category T and a subcategory P and an object X ∈ T , the comma category of X
over P, denoted by XP has as objects all morphism f : X → P in T , P ∈ P, and its
morphisms u : f → f ′, where f ′ ∈ T (X, P ′), P ′ ∈ P, are all morphisms u : P ′ → P of
P such that u ◦ f ′ = f .

Theorem 4.1. ([11], Ch. I, §2.2, Theorem 2) A subcategory P ⊆ T is dense in the
category T if and only if for every object X ∈ T the comma category XP of X over P
is coﬁltered and coﬁnally small.

Let T be an arbitrary category and P ⊆ T a dense subcategory. Let p : X → X ,
p′ : X → X′ be P-expansions of X ∈ T and q : Y → Y, q′ : Y → Y′ P-expansion of
Y ∈ T. Is said that morphisms f : X → Y and f ′ : X′ → Y′ in pro-P are equivalent,
f ∼ f ′, provided that if i : X → X′ and j : Y → Y′ are the natural isomorphisms above

Now, if T is a category and P is a dense subcategory, then a shape category for
(T , P), denoted by Sh(T ,P), or simply by Sh, has as objects all objects of T and mor-
phisms X → Y of Sh are equivalent classes with respect to the relation ∼ of morphisms
f : X → Y in pro-P, for p : X → X, q : Y → Y P -expansions. Consequently, a shape
morphism F : X → Y is given by a symbolic diagram:

p

X

f

X

F

Yqo

Composition of shape morphisms F : X → Y , G : Y → Z is deﬁned by composing
representatives f : X → Y with g : Y → Z. As indicated above one can always ﬁnd
representatives f and g with the target of f equal to the source of g. The identity
shape morphism 1X : X → X is deﬁned by 1X : X → X. Finally, Sh(X, Y ) is a set
because (pro-P)(X, Y) is a set.

Deﬁnition 4.2. An object X of a shape category Sh(T ,P)
is said to be movable
(strongly movable,uniformly movable) provided it admits a P-expansion p : X →
X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) such that X is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable)
inverse system.

Based on Theorem 2.12, with the variant for the strong movability property, and

Theorem 3.13, we can give the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 4.3. A shape morphism F : X → Y is movable (strongly movable, uni-
formly movable) if it can be represented by a movable (strongly movable, uniformly
movable) pro-morphism f : X → Y.

By the same theorems (2.12, 3.13) we have the following comprehensive theorem.

Theorem 4.4. A composition of an arbitrary shape morphism at right or left with a
movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape morphism is a movable (strongly
movable, uniformly movable) shape morphism. Particularly, if for a shape morphism
F : X → Y , one of X or Y is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape
object, then F is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape morphism.

Corollary 4.5. a) If in the category Sh(T ,P) there exists a movable (strongly movable,
uniformly movable) shape morphism F : X → Y which admits a right inverse, then Y
is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape object.

b) If F : X → Y is a movable (strictly movable, uniformly movable) shape isomor-
phism, then X and Y are movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape objects
and F −1 is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape morphism.

c) Consider a commutative diagram in Sh(T ,P)

with I and J shape isomorphisms and F ′ a movable (strongly movable, uniformly mov-
able) shape morphism. Then F is movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape
morphism.

Let Sh(T ,P) be a shape category, f ∈ T (X, Y ) and p : X → X, q : Y → Y P -
expansions. Then f induces a unique morphism f : X → Y in pro-P such that the
following diagram commutes

X

f

Yqo

If we take other P-expansions p′ : X → X′, q′ : Y → Y′, there is another morphism
f ′ : X′ → Y′ in pro-P such that f ′ ◦ p′ = q′ ◦ f . Then, we can write i ◦ p = p′, j ◦ q = q′
and this implies (f ′ ◦ i) ◦ p = f ′ ◦ p′ = q′ ◦ f = j ◦ q ◦ f = (j ◦ f ) ◦ p, which by uniqueness,
yields f ′ ◦ i = j ◦ f, with i, j isomorphisms. Hence, f ∼ f ′. In this way f ∈ T (X, Y )
deﬁnes a shape morphism, S(f ) := [f] ∈ Sh(X, Y ), and by putting S(X) = X it is
obtained a covariant functor S : T → Sh(T ,P), called the shape functor.

Deﬁnition 4.6. Let Sh(T ,P) be a shape category and let f ∈ T (X, Y ) be a morphism
in T . Then we say that f is shape movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable)
morphism if F := S(f ) ∈ Sh(T ,P)(X, Y ) is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly
movable) shape morphism.

Corollary 4.7. Let Sh(T ,P) be a shape category.

a) A composition in the category T of an arbitrary morphism at right or left with a
movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable ) morphism is a movable(strongly mov-
able, uniformly movable) morphism. Particularly, if for a morphism f : X → Y , one
of X or Y is a movable(strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape object, for example
X ∈ P or Y ∈ P, then f is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) morphism.
b) If in the category T there exists a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable)
morphism f : X → Y which admits a right inverse, then Y is a movable (strongly
movable, uniformly movable) shape object.

c)If f : X → Y is a movable(strongly movable, uniformly movable) isomorphism in
T , then X and Y are movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) shape objects and
f −1 is a movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable) morphism.

Remark 4.8. Suppose that F ∈ Sh(T ,P)(X, Y ) is given of a morphism f = [(fµ, φ)] :
X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), with p = (pλ) : X → X a P-expansion of X.
Then after an idea in [1] (Proposition 4) we can prove that the condition (2.10) from
the deﬁnition of the strong movability can be written as

u ◦ pλ = fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′).

(4.1)

Indeed, if (2.10) holds, i.e., u ◦ pλλ∗ = fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ∗, then composing at right by pλ∗,
we obtain (4.1). Conversely, suppose that the relation (4.1) is satisﬁed. Consider
λ0 ∈ Λ, λ0 ≥ λ, φ(µ′), for which we have (u ◦ pλλ0) ◦ pλ0 = (fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ0) ◦ pλ0. Then
by [10], Ch.I, §2.1, Theorem 1, condition (AE2), there is an index λ∗ ≥ λ0 such that
u ◦ pλλ0 ◦ pλ0λ∗ = fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ0 ◦ pλ0λ∗, which implies (2.10).

5 Co-movability

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be inverse systems in a
category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y a morphism of inverse systems. We say that the (fµ, φ)
is co-movable morphism provided every µ ∈ M admits λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ) (called a co-
movability index of µ relative to (fµ, φ) ) such that each λ′ ≥ φ(µ) admits a morphism
r : Xλ → Xλ′ of C which satisﬁes

fµλ = fµλ′ ◦ r,

co-movability index for µ with respect to (fµ, φ).

way we have that uniform co-movability implies co-movability.

Remark 5.4. Suppose that (fµ, φ) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) is a mor-
phism of inverse systems and let µ ∈ M. If λ ≥ φ(µ) is a co-movability (strong co-
movability, uniform co-movability) index of µ with respect to (fµ, φ), then any λ′ > λ
has this property.

Proposition 5.5. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) and Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) inverse systems in a
the category C and (fµ, φ) : X → Y a morphism of inverse systems. If X is a movable
(strongly movable, uniformly movable) system and Y is an arbitrary system, then (fµ, φ)
is co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable) morphism.

Proof. If µ ∈ M, then a movability (strong movability,uniform movability) index λ′ ∈ Λ
for φ(µ) this is a co-movability (strong co-movability, uniform co-movability)index for
µ with respect to (fµ, φ).

Proposition 5.6. Let (fµ, φ) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be a morphism
of inverse systems such that the directed preordered set (M, ≤) admits a coﬁnal subset
M such that every µ ∈ M admits a co-movability (strong co-movability, uniform co-
movability) index with respect to (fµ, φ). Suppose also that φ : (M, ≤) → (Λ, ≤) is
a decreasing function. Then (fµ, φ) is a co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly
co-movable) morphism.

Proof. In the given assumptions each µ ∈ M admits a µ ∈ M such that µ ≤ µ. Consider
the case of simple co-movability. We must show that there exists a co-movability index
for µ. By Remark 5.4, we can choose for µ ∈ M , µ ≥ µ, a co-movability index λ ≥
φ(µ) ≥ φ(µ) such that fµλ = qµµ ◦ fµλ. If λ′ ≥ φ(µ) ≥ φ(µ), consider λ′ ≥ λ′ and such
that fµλ′ = qµµ ◦ fµλ′. For this let r : Xλ → Xλ′ be such that fµλ = fµλ′ ◦ r. Then
fµλ = qµµ ◦ fµλ′ ◦ r = fµλ′ ◦ r = fµλ′ ◦ (pλ′λ′ ◦ r) = fµλ′ ◦ r. If r ◦ pλλ∗ = pλ′λ∗, then
r ◦ pλλ∗ = pλ′λ∗. The proof in the case of the uniform co-movability is easy adapted
from the above.

Theorem 5.7. An inverse system X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) is movable (strongly movable,
uniformly movable) if and only if the identity morphism 1X is co-movable (strongly
co-movable, uniformly co-movable).

Proof. If X is movable (strongly movable, uniformly movable), then by Prop. 5.5, the
morphism 1X is co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable). Conversely,
if 1X is co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable), then a co-movability
(strong co-movability, uniform co-movability) index of λ ∈ Λ with respect to 1X =
(1Xλ, idΛ) is a movability (strong movability, uniform movability)index for λ.

Theorem 5.8. A morphism of inverse systems of pointed sets is co-movable if and only
if it has the Mittag-Leﬄer property.

Proof. Let (fµ, φ) : ((Xλ, ∗), pλλ′, Λ) → ((Yµ, ∗), qµµ′, M) be a morphism with the
Mittag-Leﬄer property. Then for µ ∈ M there is a ML index λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ) such
that (2.4) holds for each λ′ ≥ λ. We can prove that λ is a co-movability index of µ with
respect to (fµ, φ). If λ′ ≥ φ(µ) and λ′ ≥ λ, the relation (2.4) deﬁnes a map of pointed
sets r : (Xλ, ∗) → (Xλ′, ∗) such that fµλ′ ◦ r = fµλ. For any other λ′′ ≥ φ(µ), one choose
λ′′′ ≥ λ′′, φ(µ) and consider r′ : Xλ → Xλ′′′ such that fµλ′′′ ◦ r′ = fµλ. Then the compo-
sition r := pλ′′λ′′′ ◦ r′ satisﬁes the relation fµλ′′ ◦ r = fµλ′′ ◦ pλ′′λ′′′ ◦ r′ = fµλ′′′ ◦ r′ = fµλ.
Conversely, let (fµ, φ) be co-movable. Let µ ∈ M and λ ∈ Λ with λ ≥ φ(µ) a co-
movability index of µ with respect to (fµ, φ). Then, for λ′ ≥ λ there exists r : (Xλ, ∗) →
(Xλ′, ∗) such that fµλ′ ◦ r = fµλ. This implies the inclusion fµλ(Xλ) ⊆ fµλ′(Xλ′). The
converse inclusion follows from the relation fµλ ◦ pλλ′ = fµλ′.

Using Theorems 5.7, 5.8 and Deﬁnition 2.15, we obtain the following corollary (see

[11], Ch. II, §6.1, Theorem 2).

Corollary 5.9. A pointed pro-set (X, ∗) ∈ pro-Set∗ is movable if and only if it has the
Mittag-Leﬄer property.

Proposition 5.10. Let (fµ, φ), (f ′
equivalent morphisms of inverse systems, (fµ, φ) ∼ (f ′

co-movable).

µ, φ′) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be two
µ, φ′). If the morphism (fµ, φ) is
µ, φ′) is also co-movable (strongly

17

Proof. Let µ ∈ M with λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ) a co-movability index for µ relative to (fµ, φ).
Consider λ ∈ Λ suﬃciently large, λ ≥ λ and λ ≥ φ(µ), φ′(µ) such that

fµλ = f ′

µλ

.

We can prove that λ is a co-movability index of µ relative to (f ′

µ, φ′). If λ′ ≥ φ′(µ),

consider λ′ ≥ λ′, φ(µ). For this there exists a morphism r : Xλ → Xλ′ such that

fµλ = fµλ′ ◦ r.

Consider the morphism r : Xλ → Xλ′ deﬁned as

r = pλ′λ′ ◦ r ◦ pλλ

.

Then f ′

µλ′ ◦ r = f ′

µ ◦ pφ′(µ)λ′ ◦ r = f ′

fµ ◦ pphi(µ)λ′ ◦ r ◦ pλλ = fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ ◦ pλλ = fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ = f ′

µ ◦ pφ′(µ)λ′ ◦ r ◦ pλλ =
µλ.
If λ is a strong co-movability index for µ with respect to (fµ, φ) such that r ◦ pλλ∗ =
pλ′λ∗, for λ∗ ≥ λ, λ′, then consider λ∗ ≥ λ, λ′, λ∗. For this index we have: r ◦ pλλ∗ =
pλ′λ′ ◦r ◦pλλ ◦pλλ∗ = pλ′λ′ ◦r ◦pλλ∗ = pλ′λ′ ◦r ◦pλλ∗ ◦pλ∗λ∗ = pλ′λ′ ◦pλ′λ∗ ◦pλ∗λ∗ = pλ′λ∗.

µ ◦ pφ′(µ)λ′ ◦ pλ′λ′ ◦ r ◦ pλλ = f ′

µ ◦ pφ′(µ)λ, i.e., f ′

µλ′ ◦ r = f ′

Proposition 5.11. Let (fµ, φ), (f ′
equivalent morphisms of inverse systems, (fµ, φ) ∼ (f ′
uniformly co-movable then the morphism (f ′

µ, φ′) : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be two
µ, φ′). If the morphism (fµ, φ) is

µ, φ′) is also uniformly co-movable.

Proof. We use the notations from the proof of Proposition 5.10 with the necessary
changes: λ is a uniform co-movability index for µ relative to (fµ, φ) and we prove that
λ is a uniform co-movability index of µ relative to (f ′
µ, φ′). The morphism r is replaced
by the pro-morphism r : Xλ → X satisfying fµλ = fµ ◦ r. Then deﬁning r : Xλ → X by
r = r ◦ pλλ it is veriﬁed the relation f ′

µ ◦ r.

µλ = f ′

Thanks to Propositions 5.10 and 5.11 we can give the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 5.12. A morphism in a pro-category pro-C, f : X → Y, is called co-movable
(strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable) if f admits a representation (fµ, φ) : X →
Y which is co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable) morphism.

Proposition 5.13. Let X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ), Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M), Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be
inverse systems in the category C and f = [(fµ, φ)] : X → Y, g = [(gν, ψ)] : Y → Z pro-
morphisms. Suppose that f is a co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable)
pro-morphism. Then the composition h = g ◦ f, h = [(hν , χ)] = [(gν ◦ fψ(ν), φ ◦ ψ)] is
also a co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable) pro-morphism.

18

Proof. Suppose that (fµ, φ) is co-movable. Let ν ∈ N an arbitrary index. Consider
ψ(ν) ∈ M and denote by λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(ψ(ν)) a co-movability index of ψ(ν) relative to
(fµ, φ). We can prove that λ is a co-movability index of ν relative to (hν, χ). Indeed, if
λ′ ≥ χ(ν) = φ(ψ(ν)) then there is a morphism r : Xλ → Xλ′ such that

fψ(ν)λ = fψ(ν)λ′ ◦ r.

Then hνλ′ ◦ r = hν ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ′ ◦ r = gν ◦ (fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ′ ) ◦ r = gν ◦ (fψ(ν)λ′ ◦ r) =
gν ◦ fψ(ν)λ = (gν ◦ fψ(ν)) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ = hν ◦ pχ(ν)λ = hνλ.

Obviously that if λ is strong co-movability index of ψ(ν) relative to (fµ, φ) it is also

a strong co-movability index of ν relative to (hν, χ).

The case of uniform co-movability is absolutely similar.

Proposition 5.14. Let in the category pro-C be the morphisms f = [(fµ, φ)] : X =
(Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµ,µ′, M), g = [(gν, ψ)] : Y → Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) and h =
g ◦ f = [(hν = gν ◦ fφ(µ), χ = φ ◦ ψ)] : X → Z. Suppose that h is a co-movable (strictly
co-movable, uniformly co-movable) pro-morphism and that f admits a right inverse
f ′ = [(f ′
λ, φ′)] : Y → X, f ◦ f ′ = 1Y. Then g is a co-movable (strictly co-movable,
uniformly co-movable) pro-morphism.

Proof. We give in detail the proof for the co-movability case. Consider ν ∈ N and let
λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(ψ(ν)) a co-movability index for ν relative to (hν , χ). If we consider an
index µ ∈ M, µ ≥ ψ(ν), φ′(λ′), then we can prove that µ is a co-movability index for
ν relative to (gν, ψ). If µ′ ∈ M, µ′ ≥ ψ(ν), consider λ′ ∈ Λ, λ′ ≥ φ(µ′), φ(ψ(ν)). Then
there exists a morphism r : Xλ → Xλ′ such that hνλ = hνλ′ ◦ r, i.e.,

gν ◦ fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ = gν ◦ fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ′ ◦ r.

Now we deﬁne ρ : Yµ → Yµ′ by

ρ := fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ′ ◦ r ◦ f ′

λ ◦ qφ′(λ)µ.

For this we have: gνµ′ ◦ ρ = gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ′ ◦ fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ′ ◦ r ◦ f ′
λ′ suﬃciently large and we transcribe the relation f ◦ f ′ = 1Y by

λ ◦ qφ′(λ)µ. Now if we suppose

fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ ◦ f ′

λ ◦ qφ′(λ)µ = qψ(ν)µ,

we continue as gνµ′ ◦ ρ = gν ◦ fψ(ν) ◦ pφ(ψ(ν))λ ◦ f ′

λ ◦ qφ′(λ)µ = gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ = gνµ.

If there exists λ∗ ≥ λ, λ′ such that r ◦ pλλ∗ = pλ′λ∗ , consider µ∗ ≥ µ, µ′, φ′(λ∗). For
λ◦qφ′(λ)µ∗ =

this index we have:ρ◦qµµ∗ = fµ′ ◦pφ(µ′)λ′ ◦r◦f ′
fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ′ ◦ pλλ∗ ◦ pλλ∗ ◦ f ′

λ∗ ◦ qφ′(λ∗)µ∗ = fµ′ ◦ pφ(µ′)λ∗ ◦ f ′

λ◦qφ(λ)µ◦qµµ∗ = fµ′ ◦pφ(µ′)λ′ ◦r◦f ′
λ∗ ◦ qφ′(λ∗)µ∗ = qµ′µ∗.

In the case of uniform co-movability, by hypothesis we have hνλ = hν ◦ r for r :
λ ◦ qφ′(λ)µ. For this

Xλ → X a pro-morphism, and we deﬁne ρ : Yµ → Y by ρ = f ◦ r ◦ f ′
we obtain gνµ = gν ◦ ρ.

Corollary 5.15. Let in the category pro-C be the composition h = g ◦ f .
If g
is a co-movable(strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable)pro-morphism and f is an
isomorphism, then h is a co-movable(strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable) pro-
morphism.

Proof. We write g = h ◦ f −1 and apply Proposition 5.13.

Corollary 5.16. If there exists a co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable)pro-
morphism f : X → Y which admits a left inverse, then X is movable (strongly movable,
uniformly movable) system. If f is an isomorphism, then Y is also movable (strongly
movable, uniformly movable) system and f −1 is a co-movable (strongly co-movable, uni-
formly co-movable) pro-morphism.

Corollary 5.17. Consider a commutative diagram in pro-C

X

i

X′

f ′

/ Y

j

/ Y′

with i and j isomorphisms and f a co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-
movable) morphism. Then f ′ is co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-movable)pro-
morphism. .

By Corollary 5.17 we can formulate the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 5.18. A shape morphism F : X → Y is co-movable (strongly co-movable,
uniformly co-movable) if it can be represented by a co-movable (strongly co-movable,
uniformly co-movable) pro-morphism f : X → Y.

Deﬁnition 5.19. Let Sh(T ,P) be a shape category and let f ∈ T (X, Y ) be a morphism
in T . Then we say that f is shape co-movable (strongly co-movable, uniformly co-
movable) morphism if F := S(f ) ∈ Sh(T ,P)(X, Y ) is a co-movable (strongly co-movable,
uniformly co-movable) shape morphism.

Remark 5.20. In the conditions of Remark 4.8, the condition (5.2) of strong co-movability
can be written as

r ◦ pλ = pλ′

(5.4)

Remark 5.21. All properties of co-movability, strong co-movability and uniform co-
movability of morphism of inverse systems and of pro-morphisms can be transferred to
appropriate properties for shape morphisms and for morphisms in the category T of a
shape theory Sh(T ,P).

6 Applications

If p : X → X, q : Y → Y are inverse limits of X, Y ∈pro-C, then a morphism
f : X → Y in pro-C induces a morphism f : X → Y in C satisfying q ◦ f = f ◦ p. In
general, if f = lim f is an epimorphism in C, f need not be an epimorphism in pro-C
(see [11],Ch. II, §6.1). But if Y ∈ pro-C is uniformly movable, then the statement is
true (see [11], Ch. II, §6.1, Th.3, and [13]). The following theorem is a generalization
of this result.

Theorem 6.1. Let f = [(fµ, φ)] : X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′ , M) be a morphism
in pro-C, let p = [(pλ)] : X → X, q = [(qµ)] : Y → Y be inverse limit in C and let
f =lim f : X → Y .
If f is an epimorphism in C, f is uniformly movable and for
each index µ ∈ M the composition fµ ◦ pφ(µ) is an epimorphism in C, then f is an
epimorphism in pro-C.

Proof. Let g = [(gν, ψ)], g′ = [(g′
ν, ψ′)] : Y → Z = (Zν, rνν ′, N) be morphisms in pro-C
such that g ◦ f = g′ ◦ f. We must prove that g = g′. Since f ◦ p = q ◦ f , it follows that
g ◦ q ◦ f = g′ ◦ q ◦ f , i.e., for every ν ∈ N one has

gν ◦ qψ(ν) ◦ f = g′

ν ◦ qψ′(ν) ◦ f

(6.1)

and therefore

(6.2)
Choose µ ∈ M, µ ≥ ψ(ν), ψ′(ν), and let λ ∈ Λ, λ ≥ φ(µ) be a uniform movability index
of µ with respect to (fµ, φ). Then there is a morphism u : Xλ′ → Y in pro-C such that

ν ◦ qψ′(ν).

gν ◦ qψ(ν) = g′

Putting u =lim u : Xλ′ → Y , so that q ◦ u = u, we obtain

fµλ = qµ ◦ u.

fµλ = qµ ◦ u.

Consequently,

(6.3)

(6.4)

gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ ◦ fµλ = gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ ◦ fµλ = gν ◦ qψ(ν) ◦ qµ ◦ u = gν ◦ qψ(ν) ◦ u.

(6.5)

Similarly,

so that (6.2) implies

g′
ν ◦ qψ′(ν)µ ◦ fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ = g′

ν ◦ qψ′(ν) ◦ u,

gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ ◦ fµλ = g′

ν ◦ qψ′(ν)µ ◦ fµλ,

and composing at right by pλ we have

gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ ◦ (fµ ◦ pφ(µ)) = g′

ν ◦ qψ′(ν)µ ◦ (fµ ◦ pφ(µ)).

From this, by the hypothesis this implies

gν ◦ qψ(ν)µ = g′

ν ◦ qψ′(ν)µ,

which shows that (gν, ψ) ∼ (g′

ν, ψ′) and therefore g = g′ in pro-C.

Remark 6.2. The additional condition from Theorem 6.1, that fµ ◦ pφ(µ) is an epimor-
µ, φ′) ∼ (fµ, φ), then for every
phism, depends only on the pro-morphism f. Indeed, if (f ′
µ ∈ M there exists λ ≥ φ(µ), φ′(µ) such that fµ ◦ pφ(µ)λ = f ′
µ ◦ pφ′(µ)λ. From this, by
composing at right with pλ, we obtain fµ ◦ pφ(µ) = f ′
µ ◦ pφ′(µ).

We recall that if C is a category with zero-objects, then a morphism f : A → B
of C is a weak epimorphism if u ◦ f = 0 implies u = 0. Weakened versions of the
categorical notions of monomorphism and epimorphism have proved to be of some
interest in pointed homotopy theory. In 1986, J.Roitberg [17] used the properties of
a remarkable group discovered by G. Higman [9] to exhibit examples in the pointed
homotopy category of weak epimorphisms which are not epimorphisms. Obviously that
pro-Grp and pro-HTop∗ are categories with zero objects. Generally, if a category C is
with zero-objects the pro-category pro-C is with zero-objects. Now the proof of Theorem
6.1 is perfectly adaptable to prove the following weakened version.

Theorem 6.3. With the notations of Theorem 6.1 and supposing that the category C is
with zero-objects, f is a weak epimorphism in C and f is uniformly movable such that
for each index µ ∈ M the composition fµ ◦ pφ(µ) is a weak epimorphism in C, then f is
a weak epimorphism in pro-C.

Remark 6.4. If Y is movable, then we obtain a weakened version of Moszynska’ Theorem
[13] (see also [11],Ch. II, §6.1, Th.3).

Corollary 6.5. Let f = [(fµ)] : X → Y = (Yµ, qµµ′, M) be a morphism in pro-C and
f = limf : X → Y = limY. If f and every fµ : X → Yµ, µ ∈ M are epimorphisms
(weak epimorphisms)in C, then f is an epimorphism(a weak epimorphism)in pro-C.

Particularly, if p = (pλ) : X → X = (Xλ, pλλ′, Λ) is an inverse limit with all
projections pλ being epimorphisms(weak epimorphisms) in C, then p is an epimorphism
(weak epimorphism) in pro-C.

Now we can state two variants of Dydak’s inﬁnite-dimensional Whitehead theorem

in shape theory [5].

Corollary 6.6. Let F : (X, ∗) → (Y, ∗) be a weak shape equivalence of pointed connected
topological spaces. Suppose that X is of ﬁnite shape dimension, shX < ∞, and that F
is a movable pointed shape domination. Then F is a pointed shape equivalence.

Proof. If F is a pointed shape domination this means that there exists a shape morphism
G : (Y, ∗) → (X, ∗) such that F G = 1(Y,∗). Then we can apply Corollary 4.7 a) and we
deduce that (Y, ∗) is movable. Now the conclusion of corollary follows from [11], Ch.
II, §7.2, Theorem 6 (i).

Corollary 6.7. Let F : (X, ∗) → (Y, ∗) be a weak shape equivalence of pointed connected
topological space. Suppose that Y is of ﬁnite shape dimension, shY < ∞, and that F
is a co-movable pointed shape morphism which has a left inverse. Then F is a pointed
shape equivalence.

Proof. By Corollary 5.16 in the shape version, (X, ∗) is movable. Then the conclusion
of this corollary follows from [11], Ch. II, §7.2, Theorem 6 (ii).
