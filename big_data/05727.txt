UNBOUNDED PERIODIC SOLUTIONS TO SERRIN’S
OVERDETERMINED BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM

MOUHAMED MOUSTAPHA FALL, IGNACE ARISTIDE MINLEND, AND TOBIAS WETH

Abstract. We study the existence of nontrivial unbounded domains Ω in RN such
that the overdetermined problem

−∆u = 1

in Ω,

u = 0,

∂ν u = const

on ∂Ω

admits a solution u. By this, we complement Serrin’s famous classiﬁcation result
from 1971 which yields that every bounded domain admitting a solution of the above
problem is a ball in RN . The domains we construct are periodic in some variables
and radial in the other variables, and they bifurcate from a straight (generalized)
cylinder or slab. We also show that these domains are uniquely self Cheeger relative
to a period cell for the problem.

1. Introduction and main result

In 1971, Serrin [16] established a celebrated result on the overdetermined problem

of ﬁnding a domain Ω ⊂ RN and a C 2-function u : Ω → R such that

− ∆u = 1

in Ω

(1.1)

and

u = 0,

on ∂Ω.

∂νu = const

(1.2)
Here ν is the unit outer normal on ∂Ω. More precisely, in [16] Serrin proved that, if Ω
is a bounded domain of class C 2 such that (1.1), (1.2) admits a solution, then Ω is a
ball. The problem (1.1), (1.2) arises in e.g. in ﬂuid dynamics and the linear theory of
torsion, and we refer the reader to [16, 18] for a detailed account on its relevance. As
we shall discuss further below, it is also related to the notion of Cheeger sets, which
in turn has applications in the denoising problem in image processing. The proof of
Serrin’s classiﬁcation result for (1.1), (1.2) relies on the moving plane method, and it
extends to the much more general problem where (1.1) is replaced by

− ∆u = f (u),

u > 0

in Ω

(1.3)

with a locally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearity f . We note that the positivity as-
sumption in (1.3) is essential, and by the strong maximum principle it is automatically
satisﬁed for solutions of (1.1) (1.2). The moving plane method, which Serrin estab-
lished in a PDE context, is inspired by Alexandrov’s reﬂection principle [1] for constant
mean curvature hypersurfaces. On the other hand, Weinberger [20] found a simpler

argument to prove Serrin’s result for problem (1.1), (1.2) without the moving plane
method, but his argument does not cover the more general problem (1.2) (1.3).

The result of Serrin parallels an earlier important result by Alexandrov [1] which
states that closed embedded hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature (CMC hyper-
surfaces in short) are round spheres. This rigidity result for bounded embedded CMC
hypersurfaces stands in striking contrast to the rich structure of unbounded CMC hy-
persurfaces which has been explored in classical and more recent papers. For a survey,
we refer the reader to [11]. We recall in particular that already in 1841, Delaunay [4]
constructed and classiﬁed unbounded surfaces of revolution in R3 with constant mean
curvature. As Delaunay’s construction shows, these surfaces bifurcate from a straight
cylinder (see also [15, Section 2] for a diﬀerent proof of the latter statement).

For some time, it was unknown whether the problem (1.2), (1.3) admits solutions
in nontrivial unbounded domains. In fact, in [2], Berestycki, Caﬀarelli and Nirenberg
conjectured that if Ω ⊂ RN is an unbounded suﬃciently regular domain such that
RN \ Ω is connected and f : [0, ∞) → R is a local Lipschitz continuous function such
that the overdetermined problem (1.2), (1.3) admits a solution, then Ω is an aﬃne half
space or the complement Bc of a ball B ⊂ RN or a product of the form Rj × B bzw.
Rj × Bc with a ball B ⊂ RN−j (after a suitable rotation).

This conjecture has been disproved by Sicbaldi [17] in dimensions N ≥ 3. More
precisely, in the case where f (u) = λ1u with λ1 > 0 suitably chosen, it was shown
in [17] that there exist periodic domains of revolution such that the problem (1.3) (1.2)
admits a positive solution. Moreover, these domains bifurcate from the straight cylinder
R × B, where B ⊂ RN−1 is a ball. The construction in [17] relies on topological degree
theory and therefore does not give rise to a smooth branch of domains; moreover, the
case N = 2 was not included. Later in [15], Sicbaldi and Schlenk extended the result
to dimensions N ≥ 2, and they obtained a smooth branch of domains via the use of
the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem (see [3]).

In further recent papers, diﬀerent types of nonlinearities f and unbounded domains
have been considered in the context of the general Serrin problem (1.2), (1.3). In [8], the
authors study examples of unbounded domains where (1.2), (1.3) is solvable with f = 0,
i.e. with harmonic functions. Moreover, in [5], the authors consider a monostable
nonlinearity f , and they construct domains whose boundary is close to dilations of a
given CMC-hypersurface and such that (1.2), (1.3) is solvable. It is clear from these
works that the existence and shape of such domains depend in a crucial way on the
function f . For negative results, excluding the solvability of (1.2), (1.3) in nontrivial
unbounded domains belonging to certain domain classes (e.g. epigraphs), we refer the
reader to the survey [7] and the references therein.

In the present paper, we wish to analyze the original form of Serrin’s problem
(1.1), (1.2), i.e. the case f ≡ 1, on unbounded domains. More precisely, we study
domains of the form

Ωφ := {(z, t) ∈ Rn × Rm : |z| < φ(t)} ⊂ RN ,

PERIODIC SERRIN

where N = n + m and φ : Rm → (0, ∞) is an even and 2πZm-periodic function. The
following is our main result.

Moreover, for every s ∈ (−ε0, ε0), the function ϕs is even in t1, . . . , tm, 2π-periodic

Furthermore, we have

and µ0 ≡ 0.

µs(t) cos(tj) dt = 0

for s ∈ (−ε0, ε0), j = 1, . . . , m,

Note here that, since the domain Ωφs is radially symmetric in z for every ﬁxed
s ∈ (−ε0, ε0), the corresponding solution u is also radially symmetric in the z-variable.
We also remark that the bifurcation value λ∗ in Theorem 1.1 is the unique zero of the

As remarked above, Sicbaldi and Schlenk [15] have derived – in the special case m = 1
– a result analogous to Theorem 1.1 where (1.1) is replaced by (1.3) with f (u) = λ1u.
Our proof of Theorem 1.1 is partly inspired by [15] and also relies on the Crandall-
Rabinowitz Theorem, but there are key diﬀerences due to the special form of (1.1).
We believe that our approach can also be generalized to study Serrin’s overdetermined
problem on manifolds. Related to this, we mention the recent work [13] where again
the case f (u) = λ1u is studied in the product manifolds SN × R and H N × R.

The overdetermined problem (1.1) (1.2) is related to a generalized notion of Cheeger
sets. To deﬁne this generalized notion, let S, Ω be open subsets of RN . For a subset
A ⊂ S with Lipschitz boundary, we let P (A, S) := H N−1(∂A ∩ S) denote the relative
perimeter of A in S. Here and in the following, H N−1 denotes the N − 1-dimensional
Hausdorﬀ measure. For an equivalent deﬁnition which extends to Borel subsets A of
S, see e.g. [10, Def. 13.6]. We then deﬁne the Cheeger constant of Ω relative to S as

h(Ω, S) := inf

A⊂Ω∩S

P (A, S)

|A|

,

(1.6)

where the inﬁmum is taken over subsets A ⊂ Ω ∩ S with Lipschitz boundary. If this
constant is attained by some subset A ⊂ Ω ∩ S with Lipschitz boundary, then A
will be called a Cheeger set of Ω relative to S.
If Ω has a Lipschitz boundary and
A = Ω ∩ S attains the constant h(Ω, S) in (1.6), we say that Ω is self-Cheeger relative
to S. Moreover, if A = Ω ∩ S is the only set which attains h(Ω, S), we say that Ω
is uniquely self-Cheeger relative to S. These notions generalize the classical notions
of the Cheeger constant and Cheeger sets which correspond to the case S = RN , see
e.g. [9].

We have the following corollary of Theorem 1.1.

Corollary 1.2. For every s ∈ (−ε0, ε0) and a, b ∈ πZm with ai < bi for i = 1, . . . , m,
the set Ωφs given in Theorem 1.1 is uniquely self-Cheeger relative to the set

a := Rn × (a1, b1) × · · · × (am, bm) ⊂ RN = Rn × Rm
Sb

(1.7)

with corresponding relative Cheeger constant h(Ωφs, Sb

a) =

n
λs

.

As discussed in detail in the illuminating surveys [9, 14], self-Cheeger sets arise in
various problems as e.g. the construction of prescribed mean curvature graphs or the
reularization of noisy images within the ROF model.

The link between Serrin’s over-determined problem (1.1) (1.2) and Cheeger sets
on N-dimensional Riemannian manifolds was also studied by the second author in
[12], where he proved existence a family of uniquely self-Cheeger sets (Ωε)ε∈(0,ε0) with
classical Cheeger constant h(Ωε) = N
ε .

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we transform the overdetermined
problem to an equivalent boundary value problem on a ﬁxed underlying domain with a
ϕ-dependent metric. In Section 3.1, we then study the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
of the linearization of the problem at constant functions ϕ ≡ λ.
In particular, we

PERIODIC SERRIN

5

study the dependency of the eigenvalues on λ > 0. In Section 4, we then complete the
proof of Theorem 1.1 via the Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem. Finally, in Section 5, we
give the proof of Corollary 1.2.

We ﬁx α ∈ (0, 1

C j,α

p,e (Rm) :=(cid:26)φ ∈ C j,α(Rm) : φ is even and 2π-periodic in t1, . . . , tm(cid:27)

Let

For a function φ ∈ U, we deﬁne

U := {φ ∈ C 2,α

p,e (Rm) : φ > 0}.

Ωφ := {(z, t) ∈ Rn × Rm : |z| < φ(t)}

as well as the spaces

C j,α

p,e (Ωφ, Rk) :=(cid:8)u ∈ C j,α(Ωφ, Rk) : u is even and 2π-periodic in t1, . . . , tm(cid:9),

p,e (Ωφ) and C j,α

for j = 0, 1, 2, k ∈ N. If k = 1, we simply write C j,α
the special case φ ≡ 1 we write

p,e (∂Ωφ). Moreover, in

Ω := Ω1 = {(z, t) ∈ Rn × Rm : |z| < 1} .

Every φ ∈ U gives rise to a locally C 2,α-regular map

Ψφ : Rn+m → Rn+m,

Ψφ(z, t) = (φ(t)z, t).

(2.1)

such that Ψφ maps Ω diﬀeomorphically onto Ωφ. Let the metric gφ be deﬁned as the pull
back of the euclidean metric geucl under the map Ψφ, so that Ψφ : (Ω, gφ) → (Ωφ, geucl)
is an isometry. Hence our original problem is equivalent to the overdetermined problem
consisting of the Dirichlet problem

(−∆gφu = 1

u = 0

and the additional Neumann condition

∂νφu ≡ −c

on

Since

(2.5)

Here and in the following, we distinguish diﬀerent types of derivatives in our notation.
If f : O → Rℓ is a C 1-map deﬁned on an open set O ⊂ Rk, we write df (x) ∈ L(Rk, Rℓ)
for its derivative at a point x ∈ O. In contrast, we shall use the symbols D or Dφ to
denote functional derivatives. More precisely, if X, Y are inﬁnite dimensional normed
(function) spaces and F ∈ C 1(O, Y ), where O ⊂ X is open, we let DF (φ) or DφF (φ) ∈
L(X, Y ) denote the Fr´echet derivative of F at a function φ ∈ O.

The following lemma is concerned with the well-posedness of problem (2.2).

Lemma 2.1. For any φ ∈ U, there is a unique solution uφ ∈ C 2,α
map

p,e (Ω) of (2.2), and the

C 2,α

p,e (Rm) → C 2,α

p,e (Ω),

φ 7→ uφ

(2.6)

is smooth. Moreover:

(i) For any φ ∈ U, the functions uφ : Ω → R and ∂νφuφ : ∂Ω → R are radially

symmetric in the z-variable.

(ii) For a constant function φ ≡ λ > 0, we have uλ(z, t) = λ2−|λz|2
(iii) Let P ⊂ L(Rm) denote the subset of all coordinate permutations in t1, . . . , tm.

2n

.

If φ ∈ U satisﬁes

φ(p(t)) = φ(t)

for all t ∈ Rm, p ∈ P,

then

and

Proof. Let

uφ(z, p(t)) = uφ(z, t)

for all (z, t) ∈ Ω, p ∈ P

∂νφuφ(z, p(t)) = ∂νφuφ(z, t)

for all (z, t) ∈ ∂Ω, p ∈ P.

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

X := {u ∈ C 2,α

p,e (Ω) : u = 0 on ∂Ω}

and

Y = C 0,α

p,e (Ω).

Moreover, let L(X, Y ) resp. I(X, Y ) denote the space of bounded linear operators,
topological isomorphisms X → Y , respectively. Since the metric coeﬃcients of gφ are
smooth functions of φ and φ′, it is easy to see that the map

Υ : U → L(X, Y ),

φ 7→ Υ(φ) := −∆gφ

PERIODIC SERRIN

7

is smooth. Moreover, for φ ∈ U, the deﬁnition of gφ implies that ∆gφ is an el-
liptic, coercive second order diﬀerential operator in divergence form with C 1,α(Ω)-
coeﬃcients. This immediately implies that, by the maximum principle and elliptic
regularity, Υ(φ) ∈ I(X, Y ) for every φ ∈ U, and consequently the problem (2.2) has a
unique solution uφ ∈ X for every φ ∈ U. We now recall that I(X, Y ) ⊂ L(X, Y ) is an
open set and that the inversion

inv : I(X, Y ) → I(X, Y ),

inv(A) = A−1

is smooth. Since uφ = inv(Υ(φ))1, the smoothness of the map in (2.6) follows.
Next, to show (i), we ﬁx φ ∈ U and note that uφ = ˜uφ ◦ Ψφ, where ˜uφ is the unique
solution of the problem

−∆˜uφ = 1 in Ωφ,

˜uφ = 0

on ∂Ωφ.

Since Ωφ is invariant under rotations in the z-variable, the uniqueness implies that ˜uφ
is radially symmetric in z and hence uφ is also radially symmetric by the deﬁnition
of Ψφ. Moreover, the outer unit normal µφ : ∂Ωφ → Rn+m with respect to geucl is
equivariant with respect to rotations in z by (2.5), i.e.,

µφ(Az, t) = ˜Aµ(z, t)

for all (z, t) ∈ ∂Ωφ, A ∈ O(n),

where ˜A ∈ O(n + m) is deﬁned by ˜A(z, t) = (Az, t). It then follows that the function
∂µφ ˜uφ : ∂Ωφ → R is also radially symmetric in z, whereas by (2.4) we have

∂νφuφ = duφνφ = [d˜uφ ◦ Ψφ][µφ ◦ Ψφ] = [∂µφ ˜uφ] ◦ Ψφ

on ∂Ω.

As a consequence, the function ∂νφuφ is also radially symmetric in the z-variable, as
claimed.
Next we note that (ii) follows from the fact that in case φ ≡ λ > 0 we have

gij
λ = λ−2δij if 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n and gij

λ = gji

λ = δij for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + m, n + 1 ≤ j ≤ n + m
(2.10)

and therefore

∆gλ = λ−2∆z + ∆t.

(2.11)

Consequently, the function (z, t) 7→ λ2−|λz|2
with uλ, as claimed.
Finally, to show (iii), we ﬁx φ ∈ U such that (2.7) holds, and we let ˜uφ be deﬁned
as in the proof of (i). Then Ωφ is invariant under coordinate permutations, and by
uniqueness this implies that

solves (2.2) for φ ≡ λ, and thus it coincides

2n

˜uφ(z, p(t)) = ˜uφ(z, t)

for all (z, t) ∈ Ωφ, p ∈ P.

By deﬁnition of Ψφ, we then conclude that the function uφ satisﬁes (2.8), as claimed.
Moreover, by a similar argument as in the proof of (i), we ﬁnd that (2.9) holds as well.

8

By Lemma 2.1, condition (2.3) is equivalent to

[∂νφuφ](e1, t) = −c

for t ∈ Rm,

(2.12)

where e1 ∈ Rn is the ﬁrst coordinate vector. It follows from (2.4) and (2.5) that the
map

is smooth, and thus we have a smooth map

U → C 1,α

p,e (∂Ω, Rn+m),

φ 7→ νφ

H : U → C 1,α

p,e (Rm),

H(φ)(t) = ∂νφuφ(e1, t),

(2.13)

whereas (2.12) writes as

(2.14)
In order to ﬁnd solutions of the latter equation bifurcating from the trivial branch of
solutions φ ≡ λ, λ > 0, we need to study the linearization of H at constant functions.
The following is the main result of this section.

H(φ) ≡ −c

on Rm.

Proposition 2.2. At a constant function λ > 0, the operator Hλ := DH(λ) ∈

(2.15)

(2.16)

and ν is the outer unit normal on ∂Ω with respect to geucl given by ν(z, t) = (z, 0).

The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 2.2.

In the

following, we put

˜νφ(ω) := [Dφνφ]ω ∈ C 1,α

p,e (∂Ω, Rn+m)

for φ ∈ U , ω ∈ C 2,α

p,e (Rm).

We start with the following simple observations.

Lemma 2.3.

(i) The map U → C 2,α

p,e (Ω, Rn+m), φ 7→ Ψφ is smooth (recall (2.1)). Moreover, the

derivative DφΨφ ∈ L(cid:0)C 2,α

[DφΨφ]ω(z, t) = (ω(t)z, 0)

p,e (Rm), C 2,α

p,e (Ω, Rn+m)(cid:1) is given by

for (z, t) ∈ Ω, ω ∈ C 2,α

p,e (Rm).

(2.17)

(ii) Let

g : U → C 2,α(Ω),

φ 7→ gφ

be a smooth map. Then the map

G : U → C 1,α(∂Ω),

G(φ) = ∂νφgφ

PERIODIC SERRIN

is smooth as well and satisﬁes

DφG(φ)ω = ∂˜νφ(ω)gφ + ∂νφ(cid:16)[Dφgφ]ω(cid:17)

Proof. (i) follows immediately from the deﬁnition of Ψφ.
(ii) For φ ∈ U and (z, t) ∈ ∂Ω we have

for ω ∈ C 2,α

p,e (Rm).

G(φ)(z, t) = ∂νφgφ(z, t) = dgφ(z, t)νφ(z, t).

Hence G is smooth as a bilinear form composed with two smooth functions, and its
derivative is given by

DφG(φ)ω = d[(Dφgφ)ω]νφ + dgφ(cid:0)˜νφ(ω)(cid:1) = ∂νφ(cid:16)[Dφgφ]ω(cid:17) + ∂˜νφ(ω)gφ,

as claimed.

Next we consider the function

¯u : Rn × Rm → R,

¯u(z, t) = −

|z|2

,

and the smooth map

U → C 2,α(Ω),

φ 7→ uφ := ¯u ◦ Ψφ.

Since ¯u satisﬁes −∆¯u = 1 in Rn × Rm, for every φ ∈ U we have

− ∆gφuφ = 1

in Ω.

(2.18)

Lemma 2.4. The map

is smooth, and its derivative at a constant function φ ≡ λ > 0 satisﬁes

U → C 1,α(Rm),

for ω ∈ C 2,α

p,e (Rm) and t ∈ Rm.

(2.19)

Proof. The smoothness follows directly from Lemma 2.3(ii). To see, (2.19), we con-
sider the smooth function

U → C 1,α

p,e (Rm),

φ 7→ ˜µφ(·) := µφ(Ψφ(e1, ·)),

where µφ : ∂Ωφ → Rn+m is the unit outer normal with respect to geucl given in (2.5).
Let ω ∈ C 2,α
geucl is constant, we have

p,e (Rm). Since the map U → C 1,α

p,e (Rm), φ 7→ |˜µφ(·)|2

0 = [Dφ |˜µφ(·)|2

geucl]ω = 2h[Dφ ˜µφ(·)]ω, ˜µφ(·)igeucl

on Rm.

(2.20)

Moreover, by (2.4) we have ˜µφ(t) = dΨφ(e1, t)νφ(e1, t) for t ∈ Rm and therefore
∂νφuφ(e1, ·) = duφ(e1, ·)νφ(e1, ·) = d¯u(Ψφ(e1, ·))dΨφ(e1, ·)νφ(e1, ·) = d¯u(Ψφ(e1, ·))˜µφ(·)

[Dφ|φ=λ ∂νφuφ(e1, ·)]ω = h[Dφ|φ=λ ˜µφ(·)]ω, ∇geucl ¯u(Ψλ(e1, ·))igeucl
+ h˜µλ(·), [Dφ|φ=λ [∇geucl ¯u(Ψφ(e1, ·))]ωigeucl
=: I1(ω) + I2(ω).

(2.21)

(2.22)

Since, by deﬁnition, ∇geucl ¯u(z, t) = − 1

n (z, 0) for (z, t) ∈ ∂Ω, we get

∇geucl ¯u(Ψφ(e1, t)) = −

(ω(t)e1, 0)

Noting also that ˜µλ ≡ (e1, 0) ∈ Rn+m on Rm, we infer that

Now (2.19) follows by combining (2.22), (2.24) and (2.25).

We are now in a position to complete the

Proof of Proposition 2.2. For φ ∈ U, we note that the function aφ := uφ − uφ ∈

By (2.26) we have T ≡ 0 on U. Thus for every ω ∈ C 2,α

(here the ﬁrst equality follows from (2.11)). Moreover, diﬀerentiating the boundary
condition in (2.26) and using Lemma 2.3(i) gives

τω,λ(z, t) = [Dφ(cid:12)(cid:12)φ=λ ¯u ◦ Ψφ]ω(z, t) = d¯u(Ψλ(z, t))[Dφ(cid:12)(cid:12)φ=λΨφ]ω(z, t)

where ν is the outer unit normal on ∂Ω with respect to geucl given by ν(z, t) = (z, 0).
Combining (2.29) with Lemma 2.4, we thus ﬁnd that

Proof. Fix λ > 0 and k ∈(cid:0)N ∪ {0}(cid:1)m

p,e (Rm) as deﬁned in (3.1), the
unique solution ψωk,λ of (2.16) is given by ψωk,λ(z, t) = b(|z|)ωk(t), where the function

follows.
In case n ≥ 2, we consider g(ρ) := ρν h(ρ) with ν := n−2

Proof. In case n = 1, both (i) and (ii) follow immediately from (3.5). In case n ≥ 2,
(i) follows from (3.6) and the asymptotic formula

Iτ (ρ)

for every τ ≥ 0,

see [6, Section 7.13.1]. Moreover (see e.g. [6, Section 7.2.2]), for τ ≥ 0, we have the
power series expression of Iτ given by

Iτ (ρ) =

( 1

m!Γ(τ + m + 1)

which shows that lim

ρ Iτ +1(ρ)

Iτ (ρ) = 0 for every τ ≥ 0. Together with (3.6) this gives (ii).

Next we see that the functions λ 7→ σ(λ) are strictly increasing on (0, ∞).

Lemma 3.3. We have σ′(ρ) > 0 for ρ > 0. Moreover, σ has exactly one zero in
(0, ∞).
Proof. By Lemma 3.2, we only need to show that σ′(ρ) > 0 for ρ > 0. In case n = 1,
(3.5) gives that σ′(ρ) =
cosh2(ρ) + tanh(ρ) > 0 for ρ > 0. In case n ≥ 2, we use (3.3)
and calculate that

for ρ > 0. For the latter equality, we used the fact that

h′′(ρ) = h(ρ) +

as a consequence of (3.4). It then suﬃces to show that the function

ρ 7→ j(ρ) := ρn−1nh2(ρ)σ′(ρ) = (2 − n)ρn−1h′(ρ)h(ρ) + ρn(h2(ρ) − h′(ρ)2)

is positive on (0, ∞). Since j(0) = 0, it suﬃces to show that j′(ρ) > 0 for ρ > 0. Using
(3.12) again, we ﬁnd that

j′(ρ) = (n − 1)(2 − n)ρn−2h′(ρ)h(ρ) + (2 − n)ρn−1(cid:0)h′′(ρ)h(ρ) + h′(ρ)2(cid:1)

We denote the induced norm by k · kL2. Then we have

Moreover, for any ℓ ∈ N ∪ {0}, the operator

is an isomorphism.

Proof. This follows from Proposition 3.1, Lemma 3.2, Lemma 3.3 and the remarks
above.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1

In the following, we let P ⊂ L(Rm) denote the subset of all coordinate permutations,

and we consider the spaces
X := {ϕ ∈ C 2,α
Y := {ϕ ∈ C 1,α

p,e (Rm) : ϕ(t) = ϕ(p(t)) for all t ∈ Rm, p ∈ P},
p,e (Rm) : ϕ(t) = ϕ(p(t)) for all t ∈ Rm, p ∈ P}.

We also consider the nonlinear operator H deﬁned in (2.13), and we note that H maps
U ∩ X into Y by Lemma 2.1(iii). Consider the open set

O := {(λ, ϕ) ∈ R × X : λ > 0, ϕ > −λ} ⊂ R × X.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 will be completed by applying the Crandall-Rabinowitz
bifurcation theorem to the smooth nonlinear operator

G : O ⊂ R × X → Y,

G(λ, ϕ) = H(λ + ϕ) +

Moreover,

for t ∈ Rm, λ > 0.

DϕG(λ, 0) = DH(λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)X = Hλ|X ∈ L(X, Y ).

We have the following
Proposition 4.1. There exists a unique λ∗ > 0 such that σ(λ∗) = 0. Moreover, the
linear operator

(4.1)

(4.2)

has the following properties.

H∗ := Hλ∗(cid:12)(cid:12)X ∈ L(X, Y )

16

MOUHAMED MOUSTAPHA FALL, IGNACE ARISTIDE MINLEND, AND TOBIAS WETH

(i) The kernel N(H∗) of H∗ is spanned by the function

v0 ∈ X,

v0(t) = cos(t1) + · · · + cos(tm).

(4.3)

(ii) The range of H∗ is given by

R(H∗) =nv ∈ Y : Z[0,2π]m

v(t)v0(t) dt = 0o.

Moreover,

Hλv0 6∈ R(H∗).

(4.4)

∂λ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)λ=λ∗

Proof. By Lemma 3.3, there exists a unique λ∗ > 0 such that σ(λ∗) = 0, which
by Proposition 3.1 is equivalent to Hλ∗v0 = 0. We put H∗ := Hλ∗ in the following.
Consider the subspaces

X∗ :=nv ∈ X : Z[0,2π]m
Y ∗ :=nv ∈ Y : Z[0,2π]m
H∗ deﬁnes an isomorphism between X∗ and Y ∗.

v(t)v0(t) dt = 0o ⊂ X,
v(t)v0(t) dt = 0o ⊂ Y.

To show properties (i) and (ii), it clearly suﬃces to prove that

(4.5)

(4.6)

To prove (4.6), we need to introduce further spaces. We recall the deﬁnition of H j

where the spaces V1 resp. W j
1 are deﬁned in (3.15) and (3.16), respectively. We note
that ˜V 1 is one-dimensional and spanned by the function v0 deﬁned in (4.3). Since the
spaces ˜V j and ˜W j are invariant with respect to coordinate permutations p ∈ P, we
deduce from Proposition 3.4 and our choice of λ∗ that

for j = 1, 2,

(4.9)
Moreover, since X∗ = ˜W 2 ∩ X and Y ∗ = ˜W 1 ∩ Y , we see that H∗ : X∗ → Y ∗
is well deﬁned and injective. To establish surjectivity, let f ∈ Y ∗. By (4.9), there

H∗ deﬁnes an isomorphism ˜W 2 → ˜W 1.

Since nf + ω ∈ C 1,α
ψω,λ∗ ∈ C 2,α
and thus H∗ : X∗ → Y ∗ is also surjective. Hence (4.6) follows.
It remains to prove (4.4), which follows from Lemma 3.3 and the identity

p,e (Rm), standard elliptic regularity up to the boundary shows that

we obtained from Lemma 2.1. Once this is done, (2.14) follows and thus we get (2.12),
which is equivalent to (2.3) with c = λ
n .
To solve equation (4.12), we let λ∗ be deﬁned as in Proposition 4.1, and let X∗ be
deﬁned as in (4.5). By Proposition 4.1 and the Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem (see [3,
Theorem 1.7]), we then ﬁnd ε0 > 0 and a smooth curve

(−ε0, ε0) → O,

s 7→ (λs, ϕs)

such that

(i) G(λs, ϕs) = 0 for s ∈ (−ε0, ε0).
(ii) λ(0) = λ∗.

Hence ∆P > 0 in Es, and thus P attains its maximum only on ∂Es by the strong
maximum principle. Since P ≡ λ2
Proof of Corollary 1.2 (completed). Since the domain Es is 2π-periodic and
symmetric in t1, . . . , tm, the solution u of (5.1) is 2π-periodic and even in t1, . . . , tm.
Next, let a, b ∈ πZm with ai < bi for i = 1, . . . , m, and let Sb
a be deﬁned as in (1.7).
Then ∂Sb

a can be decomposed into a disjoint union ∂Sτ = K ∪ S1 ∪ · · · ∪ Sm, where

n2 on ∂Es by (5.1), the claim follows.

and K has zero (N − 1)-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure. By the properties of u listed
above, we then have

Next, let A ⊂ Es ∩ Sb
a be a Lipschitz open set. Then H N−1-almost everywhere on ∂A
the outer unit normal νA of A is well-deﬁned, and H N−1-almost everywhere on ∂A ∩ Si
it coincides with (0, ei) or (0, −ei), where 0 ∈ Rn and ei denotes the i-th coordinate
vector in Rm. Consequently, (5.2) implies that

∂νAu ≡ 0

Since u satisﬁes (5.1), the divergence theorem and (5.3) yield the inequality
