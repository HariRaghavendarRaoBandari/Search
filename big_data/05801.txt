The widely-used Jones and Mueller diﬀerential polarization calculi allow non-depolarizing de-
terministic polarization interactions, known to be elements of the SO+(1, 3) Lorentz group, to be
described in an eﬃcient way. In this Letter, a stochastic diﬀerential Jones formalism is shown to
provide a clear physical insight on light depolarization, which arises from the interaction of polarized
light with a random medium showing ﬂuctuating anisotropic properties. Based on this formalism,
several intrinsic depolarization metrics naturally arise to eﬃciently characterize light depolarization
in a medium, and an irreversibility property of depolarizing transformations is ﬁnally established.

In the ﬁeld of polarimetry, Jones and Stokes/Mueller
formalisms have always appeared as dual and often exclu-
sive approaches, whose speciﬁc characteristics have been
exploited for diverse applications. On the one hand, the
description of ﬁeld coherence in the Jones calculus, which
relates the input and output 2-dimensional complex elec-
tric ﬁeld through Eout = JEin, justiﬁes its use in el-
lipsometry [1, 2], optical design [3–6], spectroscopy [6],
astronomy [7] or radar (PolSar) [8]. On the other hand,
Mueller calculus is widely used in biophotonics [9, 10],
material characterization [11, 12] or teledetection [13], as
it is based on optical ﬁeld observables (intensity mea-
surements), relating the input and output 4-dimensional
real Stokes vector through sout = Msin. As a conse-
quence, these approaches fundamentally diﬀer in their
capacity to characterize depolarizing light-matter inter-
actions (i.e., non-deterministic polarization transforma-
tions yielding a partial randomization of the input elec-
tric ﬁeld). As Jones already pointed out in one of his sem-
inal papers [14], Jones matrices are unable to directly de-
scribe depolarizing media, which can however be grasped
in the Mueller formalism via depolarizing Mueller matri-
ces. This discrepancy between both standpoints takes
part in the debate, still topical in the scientiﬁc commu-
nity, about the physical origin of light depolarization in
media [15–23]. In this Letter, we show that the diﬀeren-
tial polarization formalism, which naturally arises from
group theory, provides new physical insight on depolar-
izing light-matter interactions. This approach allows us
to deﬁne intrinsic depolarization metrics, and to demon-
strate an irreversibility property for depolarizing trans-
formations, as a counterpart to the well-known invariance
property veriﬁed by deterministic interactions.

In the speciﬁc situation of a deterministic polariza-
tion transformation, there is a clear one-to-one relation-
ship (recalled in Fig. 1) between a 2 × 2 complex Jones
matrix J and the corresponding 4 × 4 real-valued non-
depolarizing Mueller-Jones matrix Mnd [24, 25]. Interest-
ingly, when one considers normalized unit-determinant
matrices, both descriptions appear to be isomorphic rep-
resentations of the same 6-dimensional group, namely

the proper orthochronous Lorentz group SO+(1, 3) for

unit-determinant Mueller matrices (cid:101)Mnd and the special
trices (cid:101)J [26, 27]. As a result, there is a well-known

linear group SL(2, C) for unit-determinant Jones ma-

analogy between deterministic polarization transforma-
tions and special relativity [27–33], as non-depolarizing
interactions correspond to Lorentz transformations, and
must therefore preserve the Minkowski metric (deﬁned
as ||s||2
1,3 = sT Gs, with G = diag[1,−1,−1,−1]) of the
input Stokes vector sin [30].
Interestingly, this invari-
ance property can be related to the preservation of the
Shannon entropy of the ﬁeld, under the assumption of
complex Gaussian circular ﬂuctuations [34], as H(s) =
1,3/4. As pointed out
in [33], such an invariance property is neither veriﬁed by
the intensity of the light , I = s0, nor by its degree of

calculi, with a corresponding diﬀerential Jones ma-
trix (dJm) j and a diﬀerential Mueller matrix (dMm)
mnd. Both approaches describe the local evolution of a
transversally polarized wave along direction ˆn through
the respective diﬀerential equations dE/dˆn = j E, and
ds/dˆn = m s. According to group theory, these dif-
ferential descriptions lead to a representation of deter-
ministic polarization transformations (either in group
SL(2, C) or in SO+(1, 3)), by their counterpart in the
corresponding Lie algebra, i.e., sl(2, C) for j, or so+(1, 3)
for mnd, which veriﬁes Minkowski G-antisymmetry with
mnd + G mT
nd G = 0 [37]. There is a clear equivalence
between these four representations, which are linked
through the commutative diagram represented in Fig. 1,
the macroscopic and diﬀerential matrices being related
by the exponential map (J = exp(j∆z) and Mnd =
exp(mnd∆z) when propagation over ∆z through a ho-
mogeneous medium is assumed).

As Lie algebras can be viewed as the tangent spaces
to the corresponding Lie groups at the identity element
[37, 38], the diﬀerential Jones or Mueller formalisms al-
low polarization properties to be described in a linearized
geometry. One of the powerful consequences of such a lin-
earization lies in the simple linear parameterizations of
the diﬀerential matrices in terms of anisotropic optical
properties. Indeed, the dJm j and dMm mnd, that both
characterize the polarimetric properties of an inﬁnitesi-
mal plane-parallel slab of a deterministic linear optical
medium, read

(cid:21)

Notations κ and η respectively refer to the real and
imaginary part of the propagation constant, which reads
p = κ − iη when the considered monochromatic plane
wave is written as E = E0 exp[−(iωt + pz)] [35, 39]. In
the above matrices describing anisotropic optical media,
the isotropic extinction coeﬃcient is denoted κi, whereas
ηi stands for the isotropic (absolute) optical phase, whose
information is lost in the Mueller description [14]. As for
the other terms, the subscripts q, u, and v refer to lin-
ear x-y, linear ±45◦ and circular left/right anisotropy,
through xq,u,v = xx,45◦,rcp − xy,−45◦,lcp, for x = κ or η.
One can now legitimately question the physical un-
derstanding of depolarizing transformations, which en-
tail randomized anisotropic eﬀects on the incident op-
tical wave. Recently, it has been proposed to extend
the diﬀerential Mueller formalism to the more intricate
case of depolarizing transformations, by the introduction
of depolarizing dMm’s. This approach has permitted a

2

number of interesting results to be obtained on depo-
larizing transformations [40–48]. We propose below to
theoretically justify the recent developments on depolar-
izing dMms, by using an alternative description involv-
ing stochastic diﬀerential Jones matrices. For that pur-
pose, let us consider a stochastic diﬀerential Jones ma-
trix j = j
+ ∆j, modeling a random depolarizing local
= (cid:104)j(cid:105) is the deter-
0
transformation of the ﬁeld, where j
ministic average polarization transformation, whose form
has been recalled in Eq.(1), and where the ﬂuctuations
matrix veriﬁes (cid:104)∆j(cid:105) = 0. Assuming inﬁnitesimal prop-
agation over ∆z, the Jones matrix for such a transfor-
mation can be written J = exp(j∆z) (cid:39) Id + j∆z at ﬁrst
order in ∆z. From Eq. (1), this relation can be conve-
niently rewritten in a vector form in the Pauli matrices
, with

basis {σi}i={0,3} as VJ (cid:39) (cid:2)1 + ∆z

From VJ, one can derive the Cloude’s coherency ma-

provides relevant criteria to assess the physical realizabil-
ity of macroscopic Mueller matrices [26, 49], by calculat-

with c0 = (cid:104)|∆p(0)|2(cid:105), c = (cid:104)∆p(0)∗∆p(cid:105) and the 3 × 3 ma-
trix C = (cid:104)∆p∆p†(cid:105). From such a decomposition, it is
obviously seen that a deterministic transformation, with
∆p(0) = 0 and ∆p = 0, results in a CCM of rank one
(Cnd being the matrix of a projector) which is Cloude’s
condition for a non-depolarizing transformation [26, 49].
Conversely, as soon as C is a non-null matrix, the rank of
C(J) is greater than one, hence the corresponding trans-
formation is depolarizing according to Cloude’s criterion
[26, 49]. As a result, the depolarizing nature of a trans-
formation appears to be completely comprehended by the
3 × 3 positive semi-deﬁnite Hermitian submatrix C, i.e.,
by 9 independent real parameters. As will be seen be-
low, this matrix allows one to deﬁne interesting intrinsic
depolarization metrics of the medium.

It is now quite straightforward to identify these terms
with the CCM of, respectively, the non-depolarizing and
the depolarizing dMm’s that have been introduced in ear-
lier works [50–52]. Indeed, in the dMm formalism, the
Mueller matrix for the considered local transformation
reads M = exp(m∆z) (cid:39) Id + m∆z at ﬁrst order in ∆z.
As suggested in [52], the dMm m can be decomposed into
a G-antisymmetric part, namely mnd given in Eq. (2),

 0

 .

and a G-symmetric part m(cid:48)
d which corresponds to the
depolarizing contribution. With such a decomposition,
it can be checked that the 3 × 3 lower-right submatrix of
the CMM of M is only due to the G-symmetric (depo-
larizing) part of m. As a result, since Eq. (4) indicates
that this submatrix must have a quadratic behavior in
∆z, the parameterization of the dMm must be written
m = mnd + m(cid:48)
d = mnd + md∆z, with the 9-parameters
G-symmetric part reading [50–52]

md =

(5)

The proposed decomposition of m has an important phys-
ical meaning: the depolarization properties of a sample
must pile up quadratically with ∆z, whereas determinis-
tic anisotropy parameters classically evolve linearly with
the propagation distance. Such a decomposition has been
recently proposed in [53], but without a clear physical
justiﬁcation that is brought by the approach presented
in this Letter. This interesting property of depolariza-
tion in samples has been recently veriﬁed experimentally
on controlled test samples [48], and it may have crucial
implications in the analysis of depolarizing media in ex-
perimental polarimetry [2, 54].
With such a parameterization, the CMM of M (cid:39) Id +

It can be observed that C(M) corresponds to an approx-
imation of the CMM obtained above from the Jones for-
malism, where each element has been truncated to the
ﬁrst non-null term of its Taylor expansion in ∆z.
It is now interesting to identify the lower-right 3 × 3
submatrix Σ with its previous expression C = (cid:104)∆p∆p†(cid:105)
found in Eq. (4), yielding the following set of equations:

2dµq,u,v =(cid:10)[(∆η)2 + (∆κ)2]u,v,q + [(∆η)2 + (∆κ)2]v,q,u
2dηq,u,v =(cid:10)∆κu,v,q∆κv,q,u + ∆ηu,v,q∆ηv,q,u
2dκq,u,v =(cid:10)∆κu,v,q∆ηv,q,u − ∆ηu,v,q∆κv,q,u

(cid:11),
(cid:11).

(cid:11),

This clearly shows that the nine depolarization param-
eters dµq,u,v , dηq,u,v and dκq,u,v of the dMm md are phys-
ically related to the second-order statistical properties
of the anisotropy parameters of the sample. Such an
observation was recently reported for the ﬁrst time in
[23] through somewhat intricate calculus using stochas-
tic dMm’s. More interestingly, the fact that these
nine parameters are related to variance/covariance terms

through the above speciﬁc relationships is the fundamen-
tal origin of the necessary conditions that must be ful-
ﬁlled by the elements of md so that it is physically ad-
missible [45, 53]. These necessary conditions imply that
an admissible depolarizing dMm md must belong (up to
double cosetting by Lorentz transformations) to one of
the two canonical forms derived in [55, 56]:

d = diag(cid:2)d1 + d2 + d3; d1 − d2 − d3;

with the following conditions on the canonical depolar-
ization parameters: di ≥ 0, for i ∈ {1, 3}.

These previous results evidence the fact that the depo-
larization properties of a medium at an inﬁnitesimal level
are intrinsically described by the matrix Σ (or equiva-
lently C), which contains the 9 depolarization parameters
described above. However, standard depolarization met-
rics are deﬁned either on the macroscopic Mueller matrix
of the medium (e.g., depolarization index [57]), or on its
CCM (e.g., Cloude entropy [26, 49, 58]). Though often
useful, such depolarization metric deﬁnitions can never-
theless be unsatisfactory in some situations. Indeed, two
samples sharing the same ﬂuctuations properties of their
optical parameters (i.e., same matrix C) but with dis-
tinct principal polarization transformation vector p0 can
have a diﬀerent depolarization index, or Cloude entropy
in the general case. This is due to the fact that the de-
polarization index is calculated from the whole Mueller
matrix, and that the Cloude entropy depends on the four
eigenvalues of the CCM, i.e., both metrics simultaneously
depend on the deterministic polarization transformation
and on the ﬂuctuating parameters.

(cid:113)

Contrarily, the new insight brought by the diﬀeren-
tial Jones and Mueller calculus allows one to naturally
deﬁne intrinsic depolarization metrics, which only de-
pend on the ﬂuctuations of the anisotropy parameters
of the sample. One can ﬁrst deﬁne the intrinsic dif-
ferential depolarization metric as Pδ = ||Σ||F , where
||X||F =
tr[X†X] denotes the Frobenius matrix norm
[46]. Such quantity can vary from 0 (non-depolarizing)
to (potentially) inﬁnity and has proven to be eﬃcient
in situations where standard approaches fail to correctly
describe the depolarizing nature of a sample [46]. In ad-
dition, one can further gain a physical insight on the
depolarization properties of the sample by analyzing ad-
ditional quantities on the submatrix Σ. For instance,
the determinant of Σ can be interpreted as a depolar-
ization volume Vdep = det[Σ]. This quantity is equal
to zero as soon as one polarimetric direction has null

ﬂuctuations, indicating perfect correlation between two
polarization directions. Another interesting approach is
to analyze the Cloude entropy of the submatrix Σ itself,
which can be expressed as a normalized version of the

von Neumann entropy by S(Σ) = −tr(cid:2) Σ||Σ||1

Σ||Σ||1
√
where ||X||1 = tr
X†X denotes the Schatten-von Neu-
mann 1-norm (trace norm) [59]. The notation S is used
to avoid confusion with the Shannon entropy of the ﬁeld
H(s) deﬁned above. This quantity varies between 0 and
1 and adds interesting information on the distribution of
the eigenvalues of Σ, which informs about depolarization
anisotropy.
It is interesting to notice that the quanti-
ties Pδ, Vdep and S(Σ) are deﬁned irrespective of the
propagation distance, and are invariant by deterministic
unitary transformations, thus justifying their qualiﬁca-
tion as intrinsic metrics. This has the strong physical
meaning that the sample must keep the same depolariza-
tion properties whatever be its deterministic anisotropic
properties. Moreover, combining these three depolariza-
tion parameters provides direct information on the num-
ber and degeneracy of non-null canonical parameters, as
evidenced in Table I. Such a procedure, which does not
require reducing md to its canonical form, also allows
one to identify type-(i) canonical family when all three
canonical parameters are non-null.

These considerations provide a fundamental insight on
the origin of depolarization as a randomization of light
polarization due to the second-order statistical ﬂuctua-
tions of the anisotropy parameters of the medium, giv-
ing access to meaningful intrinsic depolarization metrics.
Lastly, they allow us to demonstrate an irreversibility
property of depolarizing light-matter interactions:

Property 1 For any admissible fully or partially polar-
ized input Stokes vector sin, a physically realizable depo-
larizing non-singular and unit determinant Mueller ma-

trix (cid:101)M veriﬁes ||sout||2

1,3 = ||(cid:101)M sin||2

1,3 ≥ ||sin||2

1,3.

The demonstration of this property in the general case of
standard Mueller matrices has never been reported to our
best knowledge, and is provided in a more general form as
Supplemental Material [60]. For the sake of conciseness,
we provide the demonstration of the equivalent property
for a depolarizing dMm m = mnd + m(cid:48)
d with null trace

tities are obviously non negative under the physicality

Property 1 has a strong physical meaning since it re-
veals the irreversible eﬀect of a depolarizing transfor-
mation on the propagating ﬁeld, which clearly appears
through the necessary increase of the Minkowski metric of
its Stokes vector. Interestingly, this irreversibility prop-
erty has an informational/thermodynamical counterpart.
Indeed, from Eq. (7), the Shannon entropy of the bidi-
mensional electrical ﬁeld vector can be shown to obey an
irreversible evolution with depolarizing transformations,
d||s||1,3
dz ≥ 0. Such an irreversible behav-
as dH(s)
ior of the Minkowski metric ||s||1,3, or alternatively the
Shannon entropy H(s), conﬁrms that these quantities are
best adapted to describe the polarimetric randomization
(depolarization) of a propagating beam. Contrarily to
the ﬁeld intensity or the standard degree of polarization
P, these quantities are preserved through non-singular
deterministic (and reversible) transformations, and must
necessarily grow with irreversible depolarizing transfor-
mations. This is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.

dz = 2||s||1,3

As a conclusion, the diﬀerential Jones formalism has
allowed us to provide a clear intrinsic physical picture of
the origins of light depolarization in a medium, as well
as physically meaningful implication regarding an irre-
versibility property of the beam entropy under depolar-
izing transformations.
