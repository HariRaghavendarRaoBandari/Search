Introduction

The main purpose of this paper consists of analyzing the extra fractional diﬀerentiability of weak

solutions of the following nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form,

div A(x, Du) = div G

in Ω,

(1.1)

where Ω ⊂ Rn is a domain, u : Ω → R, G : Ω → Rn, and A : Ω × Rn → Rn is a Carath´eodory function
with linear growth. This means that there are constants ℓ, L, ν > 0 and 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 such that

(A1) hA(x, ξ) − A(x, η), ξ − ηi ≥ |ξ − η|2,

(A2) |A(x, ξ) − A(x, η)| ≤ L|ξ − η|,

(A3) |A(x, ξ)| ≤ ℓ(µ2 + |ξ|2)

1

2 ,

for every ξ, η ∈ Rn and for a.e. x ∈ Ω.

It is clear that no extra diﬀerentiability can be expected for solutions, even if G is smooth, unless some

assumption is given on the x-dependence of A. Thus, we wish to ﬁnd conditions on A under which

fractional diﬀerentiability assumptions on G transfer to Du with no losses in the order of diﬀerentiation.

The regularity theory for elliptic equations goes back to the seminal works by de Giorgi, Nash and

Moser on H¨older continuity of weak solutions. Later on, for linear equations, Meyers found the existence
of a number p0(n, ν, L, ℓ) such that a priori Lp estimates for the gradient hold whenever p′
0 < p < p0.
In both cases, no regularity for the coeﬃcients is needed (other than measurability). Also, both the Cα
and the Lp theory have been extended to nonlinear Carath´eodory functions A not necessarily having
linear growth (we refer the interested reader to the monographs [6] and [8] for a complete treatment

of the subject). If one seeks for higher diﬀerentiability results, then extra assumptions are needed on

the coeﬃcients. The classical Schauder estimates are a typical example of this fact, and can be used

to prove that H¨older regularity on the independent term G transfers to the gradient Du in a nice way,

provided the dependence x 7→ A(x, ξ) is also H¨older. A very precise and uniﬁed description of such

phenomenon can be found at Kuusi-Mingione [19].

Even though there is an extensive literature on the regularity theory for equations like (1.1), recent

works in the planar situation, n = 2, have shown a renovated interest in determining the higher diﬀer-

entiability of solutions in terms of that of the datum and the coeﬃcients. So far, especial attention has
been driven to the case of fractional Sobolev spaces W α,p. It turns out that remarkable diﬀerences are
appreciated, depending on the quantity αp:

• If αp > 2, then G ∈ W α,q implies Du ∈ W α,q whenever q ≤ p (see e.g. references [5] and [18]).

• If αp = 2, then G ∈ W α,q implies Du ∈ W α,q for every q < p, but not if q = p. The reason is
α, 2
loc do not necessarily imply bounded derivative solutions. Precise results
α

that coeﬃcients in W

in this direction are given in [3] (for α = 1) or [2] (for 0 < α < 1).

• If αp < 2, then G ∈ W α,q implies Du ∈ W α,q for q < q0 where q0 depends on the ellipticity
constants, and is such that q0 < p. See for instance [3] for the case α = 1, and [4] for 0 < α < 1.

The results mentioned above refer to the planar Beltrami equation, which is equivalent to A(x, ξ) =

A(x) ξ for some A(x) which is symmetric and has determinant 1.

It turns out that similar phenomena seem to occur in higher dimensions. Indeed, recent developments

for nonlinear equations suggest that linearity should not be a restriction, as appropriate counterparts

hold even if A has superlinear growth, see for instance [7], [20] and [21]. In these works, higher diﬀeren-

tiability is obtained from a pointwise condition on the partial map A. More precisely, for Carath´eodory
functions A with linear growth, it is assumed that there exists a non negative function g ∈ Ln
loc(Ω)
such that

|A(x, ξ) − A(y, ξ)| ≤ |x − y| (g(x) + g(y)) (µ2 + |ξ|2)

2 ,

(1.2)

for almost every x, y ∈ Ω, and every ξ ∈ Rn. Under this condition, solutions to (1.1) with G = 0 are
shown in [21] to be such that Du ∈ W 1,p
loc for every p < 2. As a ﬁrst fractional counterpart to this

result, instead of (1.2) one can assume that there is g ∈ L

loc(Ω) such that

|A(x, ξ) − A(y, ξ)| ≤ |x − y|α (g(x) + g(y)) (µ2 + |ξ|2)

(1.3)

for almost every x, y ∈ Ω, and every ξ ∈ Rn. It turns out that one gets improved regularity for solutions

p,q.

Theorem 1. Let 0 < α < 1. Assume that A satisﬁes (A1), (A2), (A3), and that (1.3) holds for some

g ∈ L

n

α . There exists p0 = p0(n, ν, ℓ) > 2 such that if u ∈ W 1,2

loc is a weak solution of

div A(x, Du) = 0

then Du ∈ Bα

p,∞, locally, whenever 2 ≤ p < min{ n

α , p0}. If A(x, ξ) = A(x)ξ then 2 ≤ p < n

α suﬃces.

See Section 2 for the deﬁnition of Bα
p,q and the meaning of locally. Theorem 1 holds even for some values
p > 2, that is, diﬀerent than the natural summability for A. The reason for this is a non-standard

version of the Caccioppoli inequality, see Lemma 14 in Section 2. At the same time, Theorem 1 seems to

be in contrast with the results at [21]. Indeed, condition (1.2) fully describes equations with coeﬃcients
in the Sobolev space W 1,n, that is, the Triebel-Lizorkin space F 1
n,2 (see [17] for details), and so in [21]
the Triebel-Lizorkin scale is nicely transferred from coeﬃcients to solutions. Nevertheless, it is worth
mentioning here that there is a jump between (1.2) and (1.3), since (1.3) says that A ∈ F α
α ,∞ (see [17]
for details).

n

Unfortunately, the method does not seem to extend to the existing counterparts of (1.3) that charac-
terize coeﬃcients in F α
α ,q for ﬁnite values of q. Somewhat surprisingly, the Besov setting ﬁts better in
this context. To be precise, given 0 < α < 1 and 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞ we say that (A4) is satisﬁed if there exists

for each ξ ∈ Rn and almost every x, y ∈ Ω such that 2−k ≤ |x − y| < 2−k+1. We will shortly write then
that (gk)k ∈ ℓq(L
α ). If A(x, ξ) = A(x)ξ and Ω = Rn then (A4) says that the entries of A belong to
Bα

α ,q, see [17, Theorem 1.2]. Under (A4), we can prove the following result.

n

Theorem 2. Let 0 < α < 1 and 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞, and assume that A satisﬁes (A1), (A2), (A3), (A4). There
exists a number p0 = p0(n, ν, ℓ) > 2 such that if u ∈ W 1,2

loc (Ω) is a weak solution of

div A(x, Du) = 0

then Du ∈ Bα

p,q provided that 2 ≤ p < min{ n

α , p0}. If A(x, ξ) = A(x)ξ then 2 ≤ p < n

α suﬃces.

Theorem 2 extends Theorem 1, because (1.3) implies (A4) (indeed F α
α ,∞). The situation
changes drastically if one looks at the inhomogeneous equation (1.1). Diﬃculties appear mainly with
p,q ⊂ Lp∗
the third index q, due to the fact that if 1 ≤ p < n
only holds if 1 ≤ q ≤ p∗

α, and fails otherwise. We obtain the following result.

Theorem 3. Let 0 < α < 1, and 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. Assume that A satisﬁes (A1), (A2), (A3), (A4). There

exists a number p0 = p0(n, ν, ℓ) > 2 such that the implication

⇒

Du ∈ Bα

holds locally, provided that max{p′

α , p0} and u, G satisfy (1.1).

The above theorem is sharp, in the sense that one cannot expect Du to belong to a Besov space Bβ
p′,q′
for any β > α (as can be seen from the constant coeﬃcient setting). Moreover, our arguments also
show that the restriction p′
0 < p < p0 can be removed if A is linear in the gradient variable. In fact,
we have the following

Theorem 4. Let 0 < α < 1 and 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞, and assume that A(x, ξ) = A(x)ξ satisﬁes (A1), (A2), (A3).
Suppose that the entries of A(x) belong to Bα

G ∈ Bα

⇒

Du ∈ Bα

holds locally, provided that max{1, nq

α and u, G satisfy (1.1).

We do not know if Theorems 2, 3 and 4 remain true in the Triebel-Lizorkin setting, that is, replacing

Theorems 1, 2, 3 and 4 rely on the basic fact that the Besov spaces Bα
α ,q and the Triebel-Lizorkin
space F α
α ,∞ continuously embed into the V M O space of Sarason (e.g. [11, Prop. 7.12]). Linear equa-
tions with V M O coeﬃcients are known to have a nice Lp theory (see [12] for n = 2 or [14] for n ≥ 2).
A ﬁrst nonlinear growth counterpart was found in [15] for A(x, ξ) = hA(x)ξ, ξis−2 A(x)ξ, 2 ≤ s ≤ n.
Given s ∈ [2, n], we say that A : Ω × Rn → Rn is a Carath´eodory function of growth s − 1 if there are
constants L, ℓ, ν > 0 and 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 such that

The following result is our main tool for proving Theorems 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Theorem 5. Let 2 ≤ s ≤ n, and q > s. Assume that (A1), (A2), (A3) hold, and also that x 7→ A(x, ξ)

holds for any ball B such that λB ⊂ Ω.

See Section 3 for the precise deﬁnition of locally uniformly VMO. The proof of Theorem 5 is inspired

by that of [15], although now new technical diﬃculties arise from the fully nonlinear structure of A.

The result has its own interest, especially for two reasons. First, ξ 7→ A(x, ξ) is not assumed to be
C1-smooth. Second, the allowed independent terms do not restrict to ﬁnite measures. Under these
assumptions many interesting bounds on the size and the oscillations of the solutions and gradients are

established in [18] and [19]. Unfortunately, and in contrast to the linear situation, this time the lack of

self-adjointness is an obstacle to extend the result for values q ∈ (1, s).

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we give some preliminaries on Harmonic Analysis.

In Section 3 we prove Theorem 5. In Section 4 we prove Theorem 1 as it is illustrative for proving

Theorem 2 later. In Section 5 we prove Theorems 2, 3 and Theorem 4 .

2 Notations and Preliminary Results

In this paper we follow the usual convention and denote by c a general constant that may vary on

diﬀerent occasions, even within the same line of estimates. Relevant dependencies on parameters and
special constants will be suitably emphasized using parentheses or subscripts. The norm we use on Rn
will be the standard euclidean one and it will be denoted by | · |. In particular, for vectors ξ, η ∈ Rn we
1
2 for the corresponding euclidean
write hξ, ηi for the usual inner product of ξ and η, and |ξ| := hξ, ξi
norm. In what follows, B(x, r) = Br(x) = {y ∈ Rn :
radius r. We shall omit the dependence on the center and on the radius when no confusion arises.

|y − x| < r} will denote the ball centered at x of

2.1 Besov-Lipschitz spaces

Given h ∈ Rn and v : Rn → R, let us denote τhv(x) = v(x + h) and ∆hv(x) = v(x + h) − v(x). As
in [22, Section 2.5.12], given 0 < α < 1 and 1 ≤ p, q < ∞, we say that v belongs to the Besov space
Bα

p,q(Rn) if v ∈ Lp(Rn) and

Equivalently, we could simply say that v ∈ Lp(Rn) and ∆hv
simply integrates for h ∈ B(0, δ) for a ﬁxed δ > 0 then an equivalent norm is obtained, because

Again, one can simply take supremum over |h| ≤ δ and obtain an equivalent norm. By construction,
p,q(Rn) ⊂ Lp(Rn). One also has the following version of Sobolev embeddings (a proof can be found
Bα
at [11, Prop. 7.12]).

Lemma 6. Suppose that 0 < α < 1.

Given a domain Ω ⊂ Rn , we say that v belongs to the local Besov space Bα

It turns out that Besov-Lipschitz and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces of fractional order α ∈ (0, 1) can be
characterized in pointwise terms. Given a measurable function v : Rn → R, a fractional α-Hajlasz
gradient for v is a sequence (gk)k of measurable, non-negative functions gk : Rn → R, together with a
null set N ⊂ Rn, such that the inequality

|v(x) − v(y)| ≤ |x − y|α (gk(x) + gk(y))

holds whenever k ∈ Z and x, y ∈ Rn \ N are such that 2−k ≤ |x − y| < 2−k+1. We say that
(gk) ∈ ℓq(Z; Lp(Rn)) if

k(gk)kkℓq(Lp) = Xk∈Z

Similarly, we write (gk) ∈ Lp(Rn; ℓq(Z)) if

2.2 Nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form

This section is devoted to recall some fundamentals results of Lp
loc-theory for solutions of nonlinear
elliptic equations in divergence form that we shall use in what follows. Our ﬁrst result is a very well

known higher integrability property, that we state in a version suitable for our purposes.

loc(Ω) for some q > s, then there exists an exponent t, s < t < q such that

holds for every ball BR ⊂ B2R ⋐ Ω.

For the proof we refer to [8, Theorem 6.7, p. 204]. Next, we state a regularity result for solutions of

homogenous non linear elliptic equations of the form

where B : Rn → Rn an autonomous Carath´eodory function with growth s − 1. This means that

div B(Du) = 0

for each ξ, η ∈ Rn. We recall the following.

Theorem 10. Let B : Rn → Rn be such that (B1), (B2), (B3) hold, and v ∈ W 1,s

Then, for every ball B ⋐ Ω, we have

for all 0 < δ < 1 and some α > 0.

For the proof we refer to Sections 8.3 and 8.7 in [8] or, more speciﬁcally to formulas (8.104) and (8.106),

p.302-303 in [8]. From previous Theorem, one can easily deduce the following.

Lemma 11. Let B : Rn → Rn be such that (B1), (B2), (B3) hold. Let B ⋐ Ω be a ball, and let
w ∈ W 1,s

loc (Ω). Then the problem

div B(Dv) = 0 x ∈ B,

has a unique solution v ∈ W 1,s(B). Moreover, one has:

for all 0 < λ < 1.

for all 0 < δ < 1 and some α > 0.

We conclude this section with a very well known iteration Lemma, that ﬁnds an important application

in the so called hole-ﬁlling method. Its proof can be found for example in [8, Lemma 6.1].

2.3 Hodge decomposition

The interested reader can check the contents of this section in the monograph [13]. We recall that for
a vector ﬁeld F ∈ Lp(Rn, Rn), with 1 < p < +∞, the Poisson equation

∆w = divF

is solved by a function w ∈ W 1,p whose gradient can be expressed in terms of the Riesz transform as
follows

Dw = −(R ⊗ R)(F ).

The tensor product operator R ⊗ R is the n × n matrix whose entries are the second order Riesz

transforms Rj ◦ Rk (1 ≤ j, k ≤ n) and therefore the above identity reads as

Djw = −

RjRkF k,

n

Xk=1

where F k denotes the k − th component of the vector ﬁeld F . Setting E = −(R ⊗ R) and B = Id − E
we then have that

F = E(F ) + B(F ).

By construction, E(F ) is curl free and B(F ) is divergence free. Standard Calderon-Zygmund theory
yields Lp bounds for the operators E and B, whenever 1 < p < +∞. However, we will need a more
precise estimate, which is contained in the following stability property of the Hodge decomposition.

Lemma 13. Let w ∈ W 1,p(Rn), and let 1 < p < ∞. Then there exist vector ﬁelds E ∈ Lp′
curl(E) = 0 and B ∈ Lp′

(Rn) with div(B) = 0 such that

The proof of previous Lemma is contained in [14, Theorem 4]. The fact that the constant is independent

of n and p can be derived as in [16, Corollary 3]. We use the above Hodge decomposition to prove the

following non-standard Caccioppoli inequality, which is well-known for the community and whose proof

is included for the reader’s convenience.

Lemma 14. Let A be such that (A1), (A3) hold. There exists a number p0 = p0(n, ν, L) > 2 with the
loc ∩ Lp
following property. If p ∈ (p′
then

Proof. Let Br be a ball of radius r, such that Br ⊂ 2Br ⊂ Ω. Choose radii r < s < t < 2r, and let
η ∈ C∞
t−s . We apply Lemma 13 to
w = ηu, so that we can write

c (Ω) be a cut oﬀ function such that χBs ≤ η ≤ χBt , and k∇ηk∞ ≤ c

with E, B ∈ Lp′

(Rn), both supported on Bt, div(B) = 0, curl(E) = 0, and moreover

kBkLp′ (Bt) ≤ C max{p − 2, p′ − 2} kDwkp−1

Lp(Bt),

Lp(Bt).

(2.4)

From curl(E) = 0 and 1 < p′ < ∞ we know that there is ϕ ∈ W 1,p′
test (1.1) with ϕ, and obtain

0

(Bt) such that E = Dϕ. Now we

ˆBt

hA(x, Du), Dwi|Dw|p−2 = ˆBt

whence

hA(x, Du), Dηi u |Dw|p−2 +ˆBt

hA(x, Du), Bi +ˆBt

Using now (A1), (A3) and the properties of η, we get

|Du|p ≤ ℓˆBt\Bs

(µ + |Du|) |Dη| |u| |Dw|p−2 + ℓˆBt

Now, since w = ηu, Young’s inequality tells us that

|u|p |Dη|p + C(p)ˆBt\Bs

Also, by estimate (2.3) and Young’s inequality,

The number p0 was precisely described in [1] when n = s = 2, and is unknown otherwise.

Let 1 ≤ s < ∞, and let u ∈ Ls

loc(Rn; R). We will denote

Ms(u)(x) = sup

r>0  B(x,r)

|u|s!

When s = 1 this is the classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. We will also denote

When s = 1 they go back to the well-known Feﬀerman-Stein sharp maximal function. These operators

are classical tools in harmonic analysis, we refer the interested reader to [9, 10].

The following lemma is proven in [15] for s = 1. Its proof for s > 1 follows similarly.

Lemma 15. Let 1 ≤ s < q < ∞, and let u ∈ Ls(Rn).

(i) One has kMsukLq(Rn) ≤ C(n, s, q)kukLq(Rn).

(ii) There exists a constant k0 = k0(n, s, q) ≥ 2 such that if u is supported on a ball B(x0, R) then

kM♯

s,k0RukLq(B(x0,k0R)) ≥ C(n, s, q)kukLq(B(x0,R)).

3 V M O coeﬃcients in Rn

In this section, we assume that n ≥ 2, and that A : Ω × Rn → Rn is a Caratheodory function such
that assumptions (A1), (A2), (A3) in the introduction are satisﬁed. We also require a control on the

oscillations, which is described as follows. Given a ball B ⊂ Ω, let us denote

AB(ξ) =  B

A(x, ξ) dx

One can easily check that the operator AB(ξ) also satisﬁes assumption (A1), (A2), (A3). Now set

V (x, B) = sup
ξ6=0

(3.1)

for x ∈ Ω and B ⊂ Ω. If A is given by the weighted s-laplacian, that is A(x, ξ) = γ(x) |ξ|s−2ξ, one
obtains

V (x, B) = |γ(x) − γB|,

where γB = ﬄB γ(y)dy, and so any reasonable V M O condition on γ requires that the mean value of

V (x, B) on B goes to 0 as |B| → 0. Our V M O assumption on general Carath´eodory functions A

consists of a uniform version of this fact. Namely, we will say that x 7→ A(x, ξ) is locally uniformly in

V M O if for each compact set K ⊂ Ω we have that

lim
R→0

sup

r(B)<R

c(B)∈K B

sup

V (x, B) dx = 0.

(3.2)

Here c(B) denotes the center of the ball B, and r(B) its radius.

The main result in this section is an a priori estimate for weak solutions belonging to W 1,q for some
q > s. It is a local nonlinear version of the classical Theorem by Iwaniec and Sbordone [14]. Our proof

relies on arguments similar to those used in [15].

Theorem 16. Assume that A satisﬁes (A1), (A2), (A3) and that it is locally uniformly in V M O, and

let q > s. There exists λ = λ(n, s, q) > 1 with the following property. If x0 ∈ Ω then there is a number
d0 > 0 (depending on ν, ℓ, L, s, q, n, A and x0) such that if u ∈ W 1,q(Ω; R) is such that

div A(x, Du) = div(|G|s−2G)

weakly in Ω

for some G ∈ Lq

loc(Ω; R), then the estimate

holds whenever 0 < d < d0, B0 = B(x0, d) and λB0 ⊂ Ω.

Proof of Theorem 16. Let k0 ≥ 2 be the constant in Lemma 15. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) to be determined later.
We are given a ball B0 = B(x0, d), such that ˜B0 = (1 + 2
The ﬁrst step consists of localizing the problem. This is done by choosing arbitrary radii 0 < d
2 <
ρ < r < d, balls Bρ = B(x0, ρ) and Br = B(x0, r), and a cut oﬀ function η : Rn → R such that
u. Then clearly w ∈ W 1,q(Rn) has
η ∈ C∞
compact support in Br and we have that

Now, we multiply both sides of the equality (3.5) by v − w and, since v − w vanishes outside of BR, we
can integrate by parts thus getting

Our next aim consists of inserting the two terms with Dw on the right hand side into the term on the

left hand side, by making their coeﬃcients as small as possible. To do this, we ﬁrst look at the term

By the classical theory, since x → Aε(x, ξ) is C∞ smooth, we have that Duε ∈ Lq, for every q ≥ s.

4 Proof of Theorem 1

We ﬁrst prove that if (1.3) is satisﬁed then A has the locally uniform V M O property (3.2).

Lemma 17. Let A be such that (A1), (A2), (A3) hold. Assume that (1.3) is satisﬁed. Then A is locally

uniformly in V M O, that is, (3.2) holds with s = 2.

and thus (3.2) holds.

Proof of Theorem 1. Given a test function ϕ ∈ C∞

c (Ω) such that supp τ−hϕ ⊂ Ω, we test the equation

div A(x, Du) = 0

with ϕ and τ−hϕ, and combine the resulting identities. We have

ˆ hA(x + h, Du(x + h)) − A(x + h, Du), ∇ϕi = −ˆ hA(x + h, Du(x)) − A(x, Du(x)), ∇ϕi.

Now, by setting

Ah(x, ξ) =

1
|h|α (A(x + h, |h|α ξ + Du(x)) − A(x + h, Du))

and vh = ∆hu

|h|α , we immediately see that vh is a weak solution of

div Ah(x, Dvh) = div Gh

where

Gh(x) = −

1
|h|α (A(x + h, Du(x)) − A(x, Du(x))) .

(4.1)

(4.2)

It is immediate to check that the new Ah still satisﬁes (A1), (A2) with the same constants of A.
Moreover, (A3) is also satisﬁed by Ah but now with µ = 0. We also note that

A(x + h, Du(x)) − A(x, Du(x))

|h|α

|Gh(x)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Now, we know from Lemma 17 that A is locally uniformly in V M O, and so Theorem 5 ensures that
Du ∈ Lr
loc and as a consequence
Gh ∈ Lp
It then follows that Lemma 14 can be applied to (4.1) with µ = 0 and so there exists
p0 = p0(n, ν, ℓ) > 2 such that if one further has 2 ≤ p < p0 then

loc for each ﬁnite r > 2. In particular, if 2 ≤ p < n

5 Proof of Theorems 2, 3 and 4

We ﬁrst prove that if A satisﬁes (A1), (A2), (A3), (A4) then it is locally uniformly in V M O. When A

is linear in the second variable, this comes from Lemma 6.

Lemma 18. Let A be such that (A1), (A2), (A3), (A4) hold. Then A is locally uniformly in V M O ,

that is, (3.2) holds with s = 2.

Each of the limits on the term on the right hand side are equal to 0, since the points xr cannot escape

We now prove Theorem 3.

Proof of Theorem 3. Given a test function ϕ ∈ C∞
with ϕ and τ−hϕ, and combine the resulting identities. We have

c (Ω) such that supp τ−hϕ ⊂ Ω, we test the equation

ˆ hA(x + h, Du(x + h)) − A(x + h, Du), ∇ϕi =

ˆ h∆hG, ∇ϕi −ˆ hA(x + h, Du(x)) − A(x, Du(x)), ∇ϕi.

Now, by setting

Ah(x, ξ) =

1
|h|α (A(x + h, |h|α ξ + Du(x)) − A(x + h, Du))

24

and vh = ∆hu

|h|α , we immediately see that vh is a weak solution of

div Ah(x, Dvh) = div Gh

where

Gh(x) =

1
|h|α ∆hG(x) −

1
|h|α (A(x + h, Du(x)) − A(x, Du(x)))

(5.1)

(5.2)

As before, Ah still satisﬁes (A1), (A2), (A3) with same constants ν, L, ℓ but now µ = 0. We also note
that, by virtue of (A4) and the assumption on G, we have Gh ∈ Lp
loc for almost every h. Indeed, this
is clear for the ﬁrst term at (5.2), since by assumption G ∈ Bα
p,q,loc. On the other hand, (A4) tells us
that

not depend on h. We now write the above inequality in terms of u, and then take Lq norm with the
measure dh

only if h = rξ for some 0 ≤ r < R and some ξ in the unit sphere Sn−1 on Rn. We denote by dσ(ξ) the

Lemma 7 now guarantees that Du ∈ Bα

p,q,loc and this concludes the proof.

The proofs of Theorems 2 and 4 are almost the same.

Proof of Theorem 2. Arguing again as in the proof of Theorem 3, the fact that G = 0 now tells us
that q ≤ p∗
α , due to Theorem 5. As a
consequence, (5.3) holds for every p < min{p0, n

α is not needed to conclude that Gh ∈ Lp

α }. The rest of the proof follows in the same way.

loc for every single p < n

Proof of Theorem 4. Arguing again as in the Proof of Theorem 3, the new equation Ah is now linear
with V M O coeﬃcients, due to the linearity of A(x, ξ) as a function of ξ. Also, from max{1, nq
n+αq } < p <
loc by the results at [14]. Hence, Gh has an Lp
n
α we have q ≤ p∗
loc
majorant, and thus Dvh ∈ Lp
loc again by [14], since p > 1. In particular, the restriction p < min{p0, n
α }
can be replaced by p < n
n+αq }. The rest
of the proof follows similarly.

0 can be replaced by p > max{1, nq

α , and the restriction p > p′

α < ∞ and so G ∈ Lp∗

loc implies Du ∈ Lp∗
