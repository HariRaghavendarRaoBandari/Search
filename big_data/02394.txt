We propose an architecture for quantum simulation of strongly interacting bosons using monolayer
excitons in MoS2 quantum dots. The strongly coupled monolayer exciton and cavity photon form
polaritons between which the interaction reaches 1 ∼ 10 meV—more than one order of magnitude
higher than the state-of-art value. We discuss Mott transition in a chain of coupled cavities driven
by photon blockade and polariton blockade. The cavity system can mimic optical lattices and
superlattices in cold atomic systems. Our proposal suggests a promising route toward photonic
simulation of strongly correlated quantum states.

Introduction.— Solving strongly correlated quantum
many-body systems exactly is a formidable task. One
promising approach is to mimic such complicated sys-
tems using another simpler and easily controllable quan-
tum system, as envisioned by Feynman[1]. To that
end, the ﬁrst demonstration of quantum phase transi-
tions with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice sparked
a signiﬁcant amount of research on quantum simula-
tion with atomic systems[2, 3].
Interacting photons
also provide an unique platform to study strongly cor-
related quantum many-body phenomena[4, 5]. The main
idea of this approach is to obtain a correlated “quan-
tum ﬂuid of light”[6] by building a coupled network
of nonlinear electromagnetic cavities[4, 5, 7]. Advan-
tages of photonic quantum many-body simulation include
much higher temperature/energy-scale, nondestructive
and direct measurements of quasiparticle correlations via
single- or two-photon interference of the luminescence, as
well as abundant optical and material methods for coher-
ent control[6].

Polariton, a quantum superposition of photon and ex-
citon, emerges in hybrid systems of photonic microcav-
ity and semiconductor excitons when exciton and photon
interact strongly with each other[7, 8]. The half-light,
half-matter nature of polaritons leads to many unusual
properties: high-temperature Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion (BEC)[8–11], and enhanced optical nonlinearity for
applications in all-optical diodes[12] and transistors[13].
However, optical nonlinearity in those systems are pro-
moted by high polariton densities (i.e., one polariton in-
teracts with many others). Achieving optical nonlinear-
ity at the single photon level requires reducing both the
extent of the active material and the area of the opti-
cal cavity mode[14]. Photon blockade has been observed
when a very small quantum dot (QD) is coupled with
a cavity photon[15–18]. In those systems Pauli blockade
forbids double occupancy of excitons, and the interaction

being the exciton-photon coupling[15–17]. As the area of

between polaritons is given by Upl = (2−√

the QD is much smaller than the cavity modal area, Ω
is very small, resulting in polariton interaction less than
30 µeV[18]. Strong polariton interaction, a crucial pre-
requisite for quantum simulation of strongly interacting
bosons, has yet to be achieved.

In this work we propose a scheme exploiting the
strong light-matter and exciton-exciton interactions in
MoS2 QDs to realize polariton interaction as strong as
1∼10 meV. The H1 cavity in a 2D photonic crystal is ca-
pable of enhancing both the light-matter and the exciton-
exciton interaction when coupled with a MoS2 QD due to
its small mode area and mode volume[19]. We ﬁnd that
compared with commonly used quantum conﬁned struc-
tures, MoS2 monolayer is more advantageous for strongly
interacting quantum photonic systems. The strongest in-
teraction between polaritons at exciton-photon resonance
is close to 1 meV, considerably higher than other mate-
rials used in the community. In addition, the atomically
thin MoS2 monolayer is chemically and mechanically sta-
ble and robust[20–22]. The state-of-art fabrication tech-
nology that allows control of the position and of the lat-
eral size of the quantum dot while maintaining the spin-
valley polarization in the material[23]. Our proposal is
based on recent advancements on light-matter coupling
in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer[24–29], as
well as progresses in exploiting dichalcogenide monolayer
for single quantum emitters[30–33].

Material and Photonic Architecture.— The proposed
architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The cavity mode
is a defect mode formed by a point defect in a 2D hexag-
onal photonic crystal slab (called as H1 cavity)[19] [see
Supplementary Materials for details]. The MoS2 QD is
placed at the center of the cavity. A network of the
cavity-QD hybrid structure forms an interacting polari-
ton lattice system, which is described by the following

cavity and ωX is the same for each MoS2 QD. We shall
discuss later the situations when they vary for diﬀerent
cavities and QDs (including designated modulation and
ﬂuctuations). The collective exciton-photon coupling is

Our H1 cavity with slab thickness of 110 nm has
modal-volume 0.45(λ/n)3 and modal-area 1.0(λ/n)2 for
the fundamental mode, which is suitable for simultane-
ous strong light-matter interaction and strong exciton-
exciton repulsion. Here λ = 660 nm is the (vacuum)
wavelength of the photon in resonance with the MoS2
exciton. The photonic crystal can be fabricated using
GaP which has a refractive index n = 3.2. With pho-
tonic lattice constant a = 190 nm, the TE-like cavity
mode is in resonance with the monolayer exciton.

ergy −√

limit. Energy zero is set to ωc = ωX . (b) Photon corre-

between PB and PoB regions is labeled by the chained curve.

interaction Upl is calculated as Upl ≡ EGS(2) − E0
GS(2)
where EGS(2) [E0
GS(2)] is the ground state energy with
[without] interaction. For 1D systems considered in this
work, the quantum phase transition from the BEC phase
to the Mott insulator phase takes place at α = αc
(α ≡ tpl/Upl) with αc = 0.28 for ﬁlling factor ν = 1[38]
(i.e., one polariton per cavity).

The polariton interaction Upl has nonmonotonic de-
pendence on the QD radius [Fig. 1(b)], of which the un-
derlying physics will be discussed shortly. The maxi-
mum polariton interaction for various materials is calcu-
lated for the H1-cavity—QD system [see Supplementary
Materials for details]. The results are listed in Table I,
from which we ﬁnd that MoS2 and MoSe2 monolayer QDs
are best candidates for strongly interacting photonic sys-
tems. Fig. 1(c) shows that negative detuning can enhance
interaction and reduce the kinetic energy of polaritons,
favoring simulation of strongly interacting systems. A
full survey of α versus the QD radius rX and the detun-

We plot the energy spectrum of the above Hamiltonian
in Fig. 2(a). At exciton-photon resonance we can set the
energy zero at ωc = ωX . The crossover is caused by
the competition between the light-matter interaction Ω
and exciton-exciton repulsion UX .

The crossover between the two regimes is analyzed
using the single- and two-photon correlation functions,
g(1)(0) and g(2)(0), of the ground state of the Hamil-
tonian Eq. (5). Fig. 2(b) shows that with increasing
exciton-exciton repulsion, the g(2)(0) correlation func-
tion is reduced. The g(1)(0) photon correlation function
(representing the average photon number) considerably
increases with prompted exciton-exciton repulsion.

To show the crossover from another aspect, we plot
the two ratios Upl/UX and Upl/(Ω) as functions of the
dimensionless parameter UX /(Ω) in Fig. 2(c). The de-
pendences clearly indicate that in the polariton blockade
regime (UX < Ω) the repulsive interaction Upl is mainly
determined by the exciton-exciton interaction UX , while
in the photon blockade regime (UX > Ω) the polariton
interaction Upl is rather limited by the exciton-photon
interaction Ω.

We now determine the phase diagram of the 1D in-
teracting polariton system at zero exciton-photon detun-
ing in Fig. 2(d). The polariton Mott insulator phase
exists in the region with simultaneous strong exciton-
exciton interaction and strong exciton-photon interac-
tion.
In other regions the system is in the polariton
BEC phase. The Mott insulator phase has two regimes,
the polariton blockade regime and the photon blockade
regime, separated by the line UX = Ω. We remark
that the statistics of photon, which can be characterized
by the g(1)(0), g(2)(0) and higher-order photon correla-
tion functions, are not uniquely determined by the phase
or crossover boundaries. It is rather determined by the
ground state wavefunction of the polariton[39].

the even site, g(2)
e (0), has a dip in the negative ∆ re-
gion [Fig. 3(d)]. The photon anti-bunching is enhanced
with increasing exciton repulsion UX . For large negative
detuning, the occupation at the even site is depleted as
the even site has much higher energy than the odd site.
Photons emerging at the even site are caused by quan-
tum tunneling, of which the statistics is dominated by
the tunneling rather than the interaction eﬀect.

Realistic considerations.— Current fabrication tech-
nology can control the growth of photonic crystal cav-
ity precisely, yielding very high quality factor[40]. High
quality MoS2 QDs with radius about 20 nm (suitable
for strong polariton interaction) have been fabricated
recently[23]. Very low temperature, about 100 mK, is
needed to study the quantum phase transition, which is
available using, e.g., dilution refrigerators.
If the ﬂuc-
tuation among diﬀerent cavities, a common problem in
cavity-QD systems, can be suppressed by high-quality
fabrication, the quantum simulation can be performed
within current technology. Nevertheless, even a few cou-
pled cavities[27] can provide a platform for quantum sim-
ulation of strongly interacting few-particle systems and
serve as multi-photon entanglement light sources[42].

Superlattice of cavity-QD hybrid systems.— The above
discussions are analogous to Mott transition of strongly
interacting ultracold atoms in optical lattices[2, 3]. We
now introduce the scheme in analog to optical superlat-
tices which is realized using position-dependent detun-
ing. For example, the detuning at even lattice sites is
∆, while for odd sites the detuning is −∆ [see the inset
of Fig. 3(a)]. The single particle spectrum of a pair of
such detuned cavities is plotted in Fig. 3(a). The split-
ting between the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state
∆2 + t2. Thus at large detuning |∆| the full Hamil-
is
tonian can be truncated into the Hilbert space of the
lowest energy state. For half-ﬁlling ν = 1/2, the polari-
tonic Mott insulator phase is realized in the regime with
∆, Ω, UX (cid:29) t [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)]. For large positive
∆, the lowest energy state is mostly localized in the even
sites, while the hopping energy between adjacent unit
cells (a pair of even-odd sites) is suppressed [Fig. 3(b)].
We determine the phase boundary by α ≡ tpl/Upl = αc
where Upl is calculated in the same way as for the single
cavity case [see Supplementary Materials]. The second-
