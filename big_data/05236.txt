STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

RICHARD H BAMLER

Abstract. In this paper we generalize the theory of Cheeger, Colding and
Naber to certain singular spaces that arise as limits of sequences of Riemannian
manifolds. This theory will have applications in the analysis of Ricci ﬂows of
bounded curvature, which we will describe in a subsequent paper.

1. Introduction and statement of the main results

1.1. Introduction. Geometric limit and, in particular, blowup arguments have
become popular tools in the study of geometric PDEs. Useful applications of
these tools can be found in the analysis of intrinsic objects, such as Einstein

metrics and Ricci ﬂows, or extrinsic objects, such as minimal surfaces and mean
curvature ﬂow, to name a few. The goal behind limit and blowup arguments is
often to gain approximate characterizations of solutions of the geometric PDEs
under investigation, at small scales.
In a broad sense, the strategy of proof
is the following: One ﬁrst shows compactness of blowups of these solutions in
an appropriate topology, possibly under additional assumptions. Consequently,
any sequence of solutions subconverges to a limit space, which often exhibits
additional geometric properties. If arguments are set up adequately, then these
additional properties may be used to analyze these limit spaces more deeply, which
may give rise to extra structural information or geometric bounds. This extra
information can then be used to derive geometric bounds or local characterizations
of the actual solutions that led to the limit space.

Often, however, the conditions under which a geometric limit can be extracted
are rather restrictive. For example, in many situations it is necessary to assume
that the solutions of the geometric PDE under investigation satisfy uniform curva-
ture bounds, in order to ensure that the limit space is smooth. These restrictions
usually conﬁne our freedom to choose blowup scales and basepoints.
In other
words, limit arguments often only characterize the behavior of the solution at
the “smallest scale”.
If, on the other hand, we want to consider intermediate
blowup scales, then we need to accept that limit spaces have lower regularity,
which in turn may complicate their analysis. In the study of extrinsic geometric
PDEs, such as minimal surfaces and mean curvature ﬂow, strategies of looking
at an “intermediate scale” have been proven useful, for example via removable
singularities or the theory of varifolds.

In this paper, we discuss a similar strategy for intrinsic objects, namely Rie-
mannian manifolds. More speciﬁcally, we will establish a compactness property
of Riemannian manifolds under relatively weak uniform geometric bounds. These
bounds will ensure that the limit spaces are regular enough for a further study.
For example, we will show that the limit spaces are suﬃciently smooth away
from a singular set of large enough codimension and that the singular set satisﬁes
various mildness and tameness conditions.

These mildness and tameness conditions will enable us to carry out the theory
of Cheeger, Colding and Naber (see [Col97, CC96, CN13, CN15]). More specif-
ically, we will show that the following results hold on the singular limit spaces:
Colding’s volume stability theorem, Cheeger and Colding’s cone rigidity theorem
and Cheeger and Naber’s structure theory leading to Lp<2-curvature bounds in
the Einstein case.

The results of this paper will ﬁnd application in the structure theory of Ricci
ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature. This theory will be developed in a subse-
quent paper by the author (see [Bam16], see also [Bam15] for a preprint).

1.2. Characterization of the limit. We will now present our ﬁrst result of this
paper, which characterizes the geometric limit (X, dX, q∞) of a pointed sequence
of Riemannian manifolds {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
i=1, depending on certain uniform geomet-
ric bounds that we impose on the pointed Riemannian manifolds (Mi, gi, qi).

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

These bounds occur in the study of certain geometric PDEs, for example if the
(Mi, gi) are time-slices of Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature (see for ex-
ample [Bam16, Bam15]).

Let us now introduce these bounds. For this purpose, we ﬁrst need to coin the

following piece of terminology:

Deﬁnition 1.1 (curvature radius). Let (M, g) be a (not necessarily complete)
Riemannian manifold and let p ∈ M be a point. Then we deﬁne the curvature
radius rRm(p) at p to be the supremum over all r > 0 such that the ball B(p, r) is
relatively compact in M and such that

|Rm| < r−2

and |∇ Rm| < r−3

on

B(p, r).

on

|∇ Rm| < r−3

and |∇2 Rm| < r−4

B(p, r).

over all r > 0 such that the ball B(p, r) is relatively compact in M and such that

We will moreover deﬁne the modiﬁed curvature radiuserRm(p) to be the supremum
|Rm| < r−2,
We will often denote by {a < rRm < b} or {a < erRm < b} the set of all points
x ∈ M such that a < rRm(x) < b or a <erRm(x) < b, respectively.
Note that in related literature, the bounds on |∇ Rm| and |∇2 Rm| are often
not required. In the case in which g is an Einstein metric, which will be of most
interest for us, we can in fact drop this bound and use Shi’s estimates instead,
whenever we need a bound on |∇ Rm| or |∇2 Rm| (see [Shi89]). Furthermore, the
reason why we have introduced two diﬀerent notions of the curvature radius, rRm
and erRm, is purely technical and has to do with the fact that under geometric
convergence a lower bound on erRm implies a lower bound on rRm in the limit.
Consider now a sequence {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞

i=1 of pointed, complete, n-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds, each of which has uniformly bounded curvature. Fix some
constants

A, T > 0

and

p0 > 0.

In the following we will assume that the sequence {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
some of the following properties:

i=1 satisﬁes all or

(A) For any D < ∞ and for large i we have the following lower and upper
volume bounds on geodesic balls for all x ∈ BMi(qi, D) and all 0 < r <
√T :

(C) For any σ0, η > 0 and D < ∞ there is a σ = σ(σ0, η, D) > 0 such that
the following is true for suﬃciently large i (depending on σ0, η and D):
Rm > σ0}. Then there is a smooth

Assume that x, y ∈ BMi(qi, D) ∩ {erMi
curve γ : [0, 1] → Mi such that

ℓMi(γ) < dMi(x, y) + η

(B) For any D < ∞ there is a C = C(D) < ∞ such that for large i and all
x ∈ BMi(qi, D) and all 0 < r < D we have the following bound on the
sublevel sets of the modiﬁed curvature radius:

A−1rn <(cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(x, r)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Arn.
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)erMi
Rm(·) < sr(cid:9) ∩ BMi(x, r)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Csp0rn.

and such that

Rm(γ(s)) > σ

for all

s ∈ [0, 1].

erMi

(D) We have the following uniform log-Sobolev inequality at scales less than

√T : For large i and any 0 < τ ≤ 2T and any f ∈ C ∞(Mi) with

ˆMi

(4πτ )−n/2e−f dgi = 1

we have

ˆMi(cid:0)τ|∇f|2 + f(cid:1)(4πτ )−n/2e−f dgi > −A.

(E) For any δ, σ0 > 0 and D < ∞ there is a σ = σ(δ, σ0, D) > 0 such that
for any η > 0 and any suﬃciently large i (depending on δ, D and η) the
Rm(·) > σ0} there is a subset

following holds: For any x ∈ BMi(qi, D) ∩ {erMi
S ⊂ BMi(x, D) such that
(cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(x, D) \ S(cid:12)(cid:12) < δ
and such that for any y ∈ S there is a curve γ : [0, 1] → Mi between x
and y such that

and

ℓMi(γ) < dMi(x, y) + η

Rm(γ(s)) > σ

for all

s ∈ [0, 1].

(Note that the constant σ is required to be independent of η.)

(F) For any i, any 0 < r < √T and any x ∈ Mi there is a compactly supported

c (BMi(x, r)) that only takes values in [0, 1], that satisﬁes

erMi
function φ ∈ C ∞
φ ≡ 1 on BMi(x, r/A) and that satisﬁes the bounds
|△φ| < Ar−2.
(G) For any i and any x ∈ Mi and 0 < r < √T for which

|∇φ| < Ar−1

and

(cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(x, r)(cid:12)(cid:12) > (ωn − A−1)rn

we have erRm(x) > A−1r. Here ωn denotes the volume of the standard ball

in n-dimensional Euclidean space.

Property (B) depends on a choice of the constant p0. This constant will govern
the codimension of the singularities on our limit space. We will often assume that
p0 > 3, which will allow us to carry out standard analytic arguments on the limit
of the (Mi, gi, qi). Property (C) will enable us to deduce that regular points in
the limit (X, dX, q∞) of the (Mi, gi, qi) can be connected by smooth curves in the
regular part of X whose length is arbitrarily close to their distance. Property (D)
implies useful analytic bounds, such as a bound on the Poincar´e constant or heat
kernel bounds. Property (E) implies property (C). It will imply that in the limit
(X, dX ), every regular point can be connected to almost every other regular point
by a geodesic whose image consists entirely of regular points. This property will
be referred to as “mildness of the singularities”, as introduced in subsection 1.4.
Property (F) will allow us to localize certain analytic arguments via the use of

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

cutoﬀ functions. Finally, property (G) will allow us to deduce curvature bounds
based on geometric bounds. Moreover, it will be used to rule out the existence
of singularities in the limit (X, dX ) whose tangent cones are almost Euclidean.

Note that properties (A), (D), (F) and (G) depend on the choice of the con-
stants A and T . Properties (D) and (F) will imply the “Y -tameness properties
at scale √T ” and property (G) will imply the “Y -regularity of the limit at scale
√T ”, as introduced in subsection 1.4. Here Y = Y (A) will be a constant that
depends only on A.

Let us ﬁnally phrase the exact characterization of the limiting of the sequence
{(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
i=1. Consider the induced length metrics dMi on each (Mi, gi). Using
property (A), it is a standard result that, after passing to a subsequence, the
pointed metric spaces (Mi, dMi, qi) converge to some complete, locally compact
metric length space (X, dX, q∞) in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorﬀ sense. The
following theorem characterizes the geometry of (X, dX) depending on the prop-
erties (A)–(G). The precise terminology used in the following theorem will be
introduced in subsection 1.4.
Theorem 1.2 (convergence to singular space). Assume that the sequence {(Mi,
gi, qi)}∞
i=1 satisﬁes properties (A)–(C) above for some constants A, T, p0 > 0.
Then the limit space (X, dX) is part of a singular space X = (X, dX,R, g) in
the sense of Deﬁnition 1.7, with singularities of codimension p0 in the sense of
Deﬁnition 1.9. After passing to a subsequence, the pointed manifolds (Mi, gi, qi)
converge to the pointed singular space (X , q∞) in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.11.
Moreover:
i=1 additionally satisﬁes property (E), then the

(b) If the sequence {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞

singularities of X are mild in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.8.
and if p0 > 1, then X is Y1-tame at scale c√T in the sense of Deﬁni-
tion 1.12. Here Y1 = Y1(n, A, p0) < ∞ can be chosen only depending on
n, A and p0 and c = c(n, A) > 0 can be chosen only depending on n and
A.

i=1 additionally satisﬁes properties (D)–(F)

i=1 additionally satisﬁes property (G), then

(c) If the sequence {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞

X is Y2-regular at scale √T in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.10.] Here Y2 =
Y2(n, A) < ∞ can be chosen only depending on n and A.
The importance of the properties of the singular space X = (X, dX,R, g) that
were derived in Theorem 1.2 (i.e. “singularities of codimension p0”, “mild sin-
gularities”, “Y -tameness” and “Y -regularity”) comes from the fact that they
capture all the regularity properties of X that are necessary for our subsequent
analysis. So for the remaining results we don’t need to remember that X arises as
a limit of smooth Riemannian manifolds that satisfy all or some of the properties
(A)–(G). Instead, we will simply characterize X using those derived properties.
1.3. Structure theory of singular spaces. Next, we will analyze the singular
spaces X = (X, d,R, g), assuming certain conditions on the Ricci curvature,
which we only impose on the regular set R of X . Note that it may very well

6

RICHARD H BAMLER

be the case that these curvature conditions were violated on the approximating
Riemannian manifolds (Mi, gi) that have led to X , for example around points
that converge to a singular point in X . This is why, we did not impose any
(synthetic) curvature conditions on the singular points X \ R.
Our ﬁrst result is a generalization of Colding’s volume stability result (cf
[Col97]) to the singular setting.
It states that Gromov-Hausdorﬀ closeness to
Euclidean space Rn implies volume closeness. For technical reasons, which will
become apparent later, we will phrase our result such that we allow Gromov-
Hausdorﬀ closeness to a Cartesian product of an arbitrary metric space (Z, dZ)
with Rn.
Theorem 1.3 (Volume Stability). For any n ≥ 2, ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞
there is a constant δ = δ(n, ε, p0, Y ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Assume that X = (X, d,R, g) is an n-dimensional singular space with mild
singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -tame at some scale r > 0. Assume
moreover that the Ricci curvature condition Ric ≥ −δr−2 holds on R. Let x ∈ X
and assume that there is a metric space (Z, dZ) and a point z ∈ Z such that

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BX (x, r), x(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rn

((z, 0n), r), (z, 0n)(cid:1)(cid:1) < δr.

Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (x, δr) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) > (ωn − ε)(δr)n.

Here ωn denotes the volume of the n-dimensional Euclidean ball of radius 1.

Note that in the context of Theorem 1.3, we only impose the lower bound on
the Ricci curvature on the regular set R. We don’t require that the metric space
(X, d) as a whole satisﬁes a synthetic Ricci curvature bound.
As a corollary of Theorem 1.3, we will obtain a curvature bound at points that

are almost Euclidean under Y -regularity assumptions.
Corollary 1.4 (Gromov-Hausdorﬀ ε-regularity). For any n ≥ 2, p0 > 3 and
Y < ∞ there is a constant ε = ε(n, p0, Y ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Assume that X = (X, d,R, g) is an n-dimensional singular space with mild
singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -tame and Y -regular at some scale r > 0.
Assume moreover that the Ricci curvature condition Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 holds on
R. Let x ∈ X and assume that there is a metric space (Z, dZ) and a point z ∈ Z
such that

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BX (x, r), x(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rn

((z, 0n), r), (z, 0n)(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr.

Then rRm(x) > εr.

Next, we show that Cheeger and Colding’s Cone Rigidity Theorem (cf [CC96])

holds in the singular setting:
Theorem 1.5 (Cone Rigidity). For any n ≥ 2, ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there
is a δ = δ(n, ε, p0, Y ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0 that is Y -tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥

−(n − 1)κ on R for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ δ2r−2. Let p ∈ X be a point and assume that

|B(p, δr) ∩ R|

v−κ(δr)

− |B(p, 32r) ∩ R|

v−κ(32r)

< δ.

Then there is a metric cone (C, dC, p) with vertex p ∈ C such that

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BX (p, r), p(cid:1),(cid:0)BC(p, r), p(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr.

Finally, we generalize the structure theory of Cheeger and Naber (cf [CN13,
CN15]) to singular spaces. The following bound is slightly more general than an
Lp<2-curvature bound.
Theorem 1.6. For any n ≥ 2, ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a constant
E = E(n, ε, p0, Y ) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Assume that X = (X, d,R, g) is an orientable n-dimensional singular space
with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -tame and Y -regular at scale
Er for some r > 0. Assume that the Einstein equation Ric = λg, |λ| ≤ n − 1
holds on R. Let x ∈ X and 0 < s < 1. Then

As a consequence of (1.1) we obtain a bound of the form

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)rRm < sr(cid:9) ∩ BX(x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Es4−εrn.
ˆBX (x,r)∩R |Rm|2−ε < C(ε, p0, Y )rn−4+2ε.

(1.1)

Note that the bound (1.1) in Theorem 1.6 is similar to the bound (1.2) in
Deﬁnition 1.9 of the codimension of the singular set (see the following subsection).
However, (1.2) is only used to characterize the severity of the singularities of the
singular spaces X and was allowed to depend on X . So the content of Theorem 1.6
is that E can, in fact, be chosen depending only on p and Y and independently
of the constant in (1.2).

1.4. Important terminology. We now give a precise deﬁnition of the termi-
nology that was used in the theorems of corollaries of the previous subsection
and which we will use throughout this paper. Let us ﬁrst introduce the following
notion: Given a measurable subset S ⊂ M of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) we
will denote by |S| = |S|g the Riemannian measure of S with respect to the metric
g.
We now deﬁne what we mean by the singular spaces that appeared as limit
spaces in Theorem 1.2. The following deﬁnition comprises the most basic notions
of a metric space that is suﬃciently diﬀerentiable on a generic subset.
Deﬁnition 1.7 (singular space). A tuple X = (X, d,R, g) is called an (n-
dimensional) singular space if the following holds:

(1) (X, d) is a locally compact, complete metric length space.
(2) R ⊂ X is an open and dense subset that is equipped with the structure of
a diﬀerentiable n-manifold of regularity C 4 whose topology is equal to the
topology induced by X.

(3) g is a Riemannian metric on R of regularity C 3.

(4) The length metric of (R, g) is equal to the restriction of d to R. In other

words, (X, d) is the completion of the length metric on (R, g).
0 < κ1(K, D) < κ2(K, D) < ∞ such that for all x ∈ K and 0 < r < D

κ1rn < |B(x, r) ∩ R| < κ2rn.

j, then R′

Here | · | denotes the Riemannian volume with respect to the metric g and
distance balls B(x, r) are measured with respect to the metric d.
If q ∈ X is a point, then the tuple (X , q) or (X, d,R, g, q) is called pointed
singular space. The subset R is called the regular part of X and its complement
X \ R the singular part of X . We say that X is orientable, if R is orientable.
Decorations of X are inherited by its members. That is, for example, if we
j automatically denotes its regular part. We also

refer to the space X ′
denote open annuli in X by A(p, r1, r2) = {x ∈ X : r1 < d(x, p) < r2}.
We emphasize that the metric d on X is induced by the length metric of the
Riemannian metric g on R (see item (4)). So the distance between any two
points in R can be approximated arbitrarily well by the length of a diﬀerentiable
connecting curve in R.
We can generalize the concept of curvature radius from Deﬁnition 1.1 to sin-
gular spaces X = (X, d,R, g) by deﬁning the function rRm : X → [0,∞] as
follows: rRm|X\R ≡ 0 and for any x ∈ R let rRm(x) be the curvature radius of
the (incomplete) Riemannian manifold (R, g) as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.1.
We will always imagine the singular part X \ R as a closed subset of measure
zero. All analytic arguments of this paper that require local computations will
be carried out on the regular part R ⊂ X and, similarly, curvature conditions
will only be imposed on R. Whenever necessary, we will argue why it is enough
to consider only this generic subset. The following two characterizations of the
singular set will be helpful hereby:
Deﬁnition 1.8 (mild singularities). A singular space X = (X, d,R, g) is said
to have mild singularities if for any p ∈ X there is a closed subset Qp ⊂ R of
measure zero such that for any x ∈ R\ Qp there is a minimizing geodesic between
p and x whose image lies in R.

The idea behind the notion of mild singularities also occurs in the work of
Cheeger and Colding (see [CC00, Theorem 3.9] and Chen and Wang (see [CW14,
Deﬁnition 2.1]).
Deﬁnition 1.9 (singularities of codimension p0). A singular space X = (X, d,
R, g) is said to have singularities of codimension p0, for some p0 > 0, if for any
0 < p < p0, x ∈ X and r0 > 0 there is an Ep,x,r0 < ∞ (which may depend on
X ) such that the following holds: For any 0 < r < r0 and 0 < s < 1 we have

(1.2)
We will often combine the last two properties and say that X has mild singu-

|{rRm < sr} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R| ≤ Ep,x,r0sprn.

larities of codimension p0.

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

An elementary covering argument shows that if an n-dimensional singular space
X = (X, d,R, g) has singularities of codimension p0, then the Minkowski (and
hence also Hausdorﬀ) dimension of X \ R is ≤ n − p0.
Deﬁnition 1.9 can be seen as an analogue of the density estimate in the work
of Chen and Wang (see [CW14, Deﬁnition 3.3]).

We will now deﬁne the following properties of singular spaces:

Deﬁnition 1.10 (Y -regularity). A singular space X is called Y -regular at scales
less than a, for some a, Y > 0, if for any p ∈ X and 0 < r < a the following
holds: If

then p ∈ R and rRm(y) > Y −1r.

|B(p, r) ∩ R| > (ωn − Y −1)rn,

The notion of Y -regularity is standard in the study of Einstein metrics. A
similar notion has been used in [CC00] and [And89] and, in the setting of Ricci
ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature, in [CW14, Deﬁnition 3.3] and [TZ13, The-
orem 2.35].

It can be shown that in a Y -regular space with singularities of codimension p0
(for some p0 > 0), any point p ∈ X whose tangent cone is isometric to Rn, is
actually contained in R. Therefore, the regular set R and the metric g in such a
space is uniquely characterized by the metric d.
Next, we deﬁne what we understand by convergence towards a singular space.

Deﬁnition 1.11 (convergence and convergence scheme). Consider a sequence
(Mi, gi, qi) of pointed n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and a pointed, n-
dimensional singular space (X , q∞) = (X, d,R, g, q∞). Let Ui ⊂ R and Vi ⊂ Mi
be open subsets and Φi : Ui → Vi be (bijective) diﬀeomorphisms such that the
following holds:
(1) U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ . . .
(2) S∞
i=1 Ui = R.
(3) For any open and relatively compact W ⊂ R we have Φ∗
the C 3-sense.
(4) There exists a sequence q∗

i gi → g on W in

i ∈ Ui such that
i ), qi) → 0.

dMi(Φi(q∗

(5) For any R < ∞ and ε > 0 there is an iR,ε < ∞ such that for all i > iR,ε

and x, y ∈ BX (q∞, R) ∩ Ui we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)dMi(Φi(x), Φi(y)) − dX (x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε

and such that for any i > iR,ε and x ∈ BMi(qi, R) there is a y ∈ Vi such
that dMi(x, y) < ε.

Then the sequence {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞
i=1 is called a convergence scheme for the se-
quence of pointed Riemannian manifolds (Mi, gi, qi) and the pointed singular
space (X , q∞). We say that (Mi, gi, qi) converges to (X , q∞) if such a conver-
gence scheme exists.

Lastly, we introduce the Y -tameness properties. These properties are rather
technical and mostly ensure that the theory of Cheeger, Colding and Naber can
be applied to Y -tame singular spaces.
Deﬁnition 1.12 (Y -tameness). A singular space X is said to be Y -tame at scale
a for some Y, a > 0 if the following tameness properties hold:

(1) We have the volume bounds

Y −1rn < |B(p, r) ∩ R| < Y rn

p ∈ X and 0 < r < a.
(2) For any p ∈ X, q ∈ R and 0 < r < min{a, d(p, q)} the following holds:

Deﬁne the function b(x) := d(x, q) on X. Then there is a bounded

for all

C 3-function h : B(x, r) ∩ R → R that satisﬁes △h = 0 and

smooth Riemannian manifolds. We may imagine in the following that h is the
solution of the Dirichlet problem with the boundary values b on ∂B(p, r), but
this fact will never be used.

1.5. Conventions. In the following we will ﬁx a dimension n ≥ 2 and we will
omit the dependence of our constants on n. Moreover, when working with a
manifold M of regularity C 4, then we will call objects involving M that have
maximal regularity smooth. For example, we will call a curve γ : [a, b] → M
smooth if it has regularity C 4 and a function f : M → R smooth if it has
regularity C 4.

2. Geometry of incomplete Riemannian manifolds

In this section we review basic facts from Riemannian geometry. We will phrase
our results in such a way that they also hold for incomplete Riemannian manifolds.
So let in the following (M, g) be a (not necessarily complete) Riemannian manifold
of dimension n ≥ 2. More speciﬁcally, we assume that M is of regularity C 4
(meaning that the chart transition maps have regularity C 4) and the Riemannian
metric g has regularity C 3. Note that g induces a length metric d on M, but due
to the possible incompleteness, the distance d(x, y) between two points x, y ∈ M
may not be represented by a minimizing geodesic between x, y. However, we have
the following result:

12

RICHARD H BAMLER

Lemma 2.1. Let (M, g) be a (not necessarily complete) Riemannian manifold
and x, y ∈ M. Then there is an arclength, minimizing geodesic γ : [0, l) → M
with γ(0) = x such that

d(x, γ(t)) + d(γ(t), y) = d(x, y)

for all

t ∈ [0, l)

and such that either l = d(x, y) and γ(t) → y as t → l or l < d(x, y) and γ(t)
does not converge in M as t → l.
Proof. Choose r > 0 such that the ball B(x, 2r) is relatively compact in M and
such that the exponential map expx is deﬁned on B(0, 2r) ⊂ TxM. Choose
z ∈ B(x, 2r) such that d(x, z) = r and d(x, z) + d(z, y) is minimal. Such a z
exists by relative compactness of B(x, 2r). Since d is a length metric, we have
d(x, z) + d(z, y) = d(x, y). By standard Riemannian geometry, there exists an
arclength, minimizing geodesic σ : [0, r] → M between x, z. Then for all t ∈ [0, r]
d(x, y) ≤ d(x, σ(t)) + d(σ(t), y) = d(x, z) − d(σ(t), z) + d(σ(t), y)

≤ d(x, z) − d(σ(t), z) + d(σ(t), z) + d(z, y) = d(x, y).

So

d(x, σ(t)) + d(σ(t), y) = d(x, y)

for all

t ∈ [0, r].

By solving the geodesic equation, we can extend σ to an arclength geodesic γ :
[0, l) → M for some maximal l ≤ d(x, y). We now show that γ satisﬁes the
claim of the lemma. Choose t0 ∈ [0, l] maximal with the property that γ|[0,t0)
is minimizing and with the property that d(x, γ(t)) + d(γ(t), y) = d(x, y) for all
t ∈ [0, t0).
If t0 = l, then we are done, so assume t0 < l and set w := γ(t0). By the same
arguments as before, replacing x by w, we can ﬁnd an r∗ > 0 and an arclength,
minimizing geodesic σ∗ : [0, r∗] → M with σ∗(0) = w such that

d(w, σ∗(t)) + d(σ∗(t), y) = d(w, y)

for all

t ∈ [0, r∗].

Then
ℓ(γ|[0,t0]) + ℓ(σ∗) = d(x, w) + d(w, σ∗(r∗))

= d(x, y) − d(w, y) + d(w, σ∗(r∗)) = d(x, y) − d(σ∗(r∗), y) ≤ d(x, σ∗(r∗)).
It follows that the concatenation of γ|[0,t0] and σ∗ is a minimizing geodesic. This
implies that γ′(t0) = (σ∗)′(0) and hence γ(t0 + t) = σ∗(t) for all t ∈ [0, r∗]. So
γ|[0,t0+r∗] is minimizing and for any t ∈ [0, r∗] we have
d(x, y) ≤ d(x, γ(t0 + t)) + d(γ(t0 + t), y)

≤ d(x, w) + d(w, σ∗(t)) + d(σ∗(t), y) = d(x, w) + d(w, y) = d(x, y),

contradicting the maximal choice of t0. This ﬁnishes the proof.

(cid:3)

Next, we generalize the concept of the exponential map and the cut locus to

incomplete Riemannian manifolds.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let (M, g) be a (not necessarily complete) Riemannian manifold
and p ∈ M. For every vector v ∈ TpM let γv : [0, lp(v)) → M be the constant
speed geodesic with γv(0) = p and γ′
v(0) = v, where lp(v) ∈ (0,∞] is chosen such
that [0, lp(v)) is the maximal interval of existence. Deﬁne the domain

Dp :=(cid:8)v ∈ TpM :
: d(p, expp((1 + ε)v)) = |(1 + ε)v|

lp(v) > 1(cid:9) ⊂ TpM

and the exponential map expp : Dp → M by expp(v) := γv(1). We also deﬁne
ε > 0(cid:9).

Next, we deﬁne the following two ranges in M:

for some

p :=(cid:8)v ∈ Dp
D∗
Gp :=(cid:8)x ∈ M :

and
p :=(cid:8)x ∈ M :
G∗

Finally, we set

and

there is a minimizing geodesic

γ : [0, l] → M with γ(0) = p, γ(l) = x(cid:9)

D := [p∈M

there is a minimizing geodesic γ : [0, l] → M

and some 0 ≤ t < l such that γ(0) = p, γ(t) = x(cid:9).

true for any p ∈ M:

more generally, for each x ∈ G∗

tween p, x and the point x is not a conjugate point to p along this geodesic.

p and satisﬁes |∇b| = 1 there.

[0, d(p, q)] → M between p, q and γp,q depends smoothly on p, q.

Proof. For assertion (a) observe that if x ∈ Gp, then there is a v ∈ TpM such that
lv > 1 and x = γv(1). So expp(Dp) ⊃ Gp. The remaining identities are clear.
Before continuing with the proof, we establish the following two useful claims:

14

RICHARD H BAMLER

Claim 1. Let lv ∈ D∗
M be an arclength, minimizing geodesic such that σ(l) = x and

p, |v| = 1, l ≥ 0 and set x := γv(l) ∈ G∗

p. Let σ : [l − a, l] →

d(p, σ(l − a)) + d(σ(l − a), x) = d(p, x).

Then σ is a subsegment of γv, i.e. σ(t) = γv(t) for all t ∈ [l − a, l].
Proof. This claim is similar to parts of [dC92, Chp 13, Proposition 2.2]. By
deﬁnition, there is a constant ε > 0 such that γv|[0,l+ε] is minimizing. Then
ℓ(γv|[l,l+ε]) + ℓ(σ) = d(x, γv(l + ε)) + d(σ(l − a), x)
= d(p, γv(l + ε)) − d(p, x) + d(σ(l − a), x) = d(p, γv(l + ε)) − d(p, σ(l − a))
≤ d(σ(l − a), γv(l + ε)).
It follows that the concatenation of σ and γv|[l,l+ε] is a minimizing geodesic and
hence that σ′(l) = γ′
Claim 2. Assume that lv ∈ D∗
that there is a point y ∈ M such that

p, |v| = 1, l ≥ 0 and set x := γv(l) ∈ G∗

v(l). The claim follows immediately from this.

p . Assume

(cid:3)

d(p, y) + d(y, x) = d(p, x)

Then y = γv(t) for some t ∈ [0, l].
Proof. Apply Lemma 2.1 with p ← x and x ← y to obtain an arclength, mini-
mizing geodesic σ : (l′, l] → M for some minimal l′ ∈ [d(p, y), l] such that

d(y, σ(t)) + d(σ(t), x) = d(y, x)

for all

t ∈ (l′, l]

Then for all t ∈ (l′, l]
d(p, x) ≤ d(p, σ(t)) + d(σ(t), x)

≤ d(p, y) + d(y, σ(t)) + d(σ(t), x) = d(p, y) + d(y, x) = d(p, x).
So by Claim 1 we have σ = γv|(l′,l]. It follows that l′ = d(p, y) and hence y =
limt→d(p,y) σ(t) = γv(d(p, y)).

(cid:3)

Let us now return to the proof of the proposition. Assertion (d) is a direct
consequence of Claim 1 and [dC92, Chp 11, Corollary 2.9], modulo the fact that
D∗
p is open (which is needed for the statement that the map is a diﬀeomorphism).
Consider now assertion (b). The fact that Dp and D are open follows from the
lower semi-continuity of lp(v) in p and v. It remains to show that D∗ is open.
The fact that G∗ is open will then follow using assertion (d). Assume that D∗
was not open, i.e. there is some lv ∈ TpM ∩ D∗ = D∗
p, |v| = 1, l ≥ 0 that is not
in the interior of D∗. By assumption, we can ﬁnd a sequence pi ∈ M with pi → p
and a sequence of vectors

livi ∈ TpiM ∩ (D \ D∗) = Dpi \ D∗
pi,
|vi| = 1, li ≥ 0 with livi → lv. Set x := γv(l) ∈ G∗
p , xi := γvi(li) and x′
γvi(li + 1/i). Then, since livi 6∈ D∗

After passing to a subsequence, we can ﬁnd an r > 0 such that li > r for all i and

for all

i.e. σ([0, r]) ⊂ γv([0, l]) and hence σ = γv|[0,r].

Recall that snκ(t) models the growth of Jacobi ﬁelds in the model space of con-
stant sectional curvature κ. In particular, the volume vκ(r) of a geodesic r-ball
in the n-dimensional model space of constant sectional curvature κ is can be

computed as follows if r ≤ π√κ for κ > 0:

Proposition 2.4 (monotonicity of the volume element). Let (M n, g) be a (not

Proof. This fact follows as in the classic Bishop-Gromov volume comparison. The
manifold M does not need to be complete, as the proof is just a computation along
minimizing geodesics. See for example [Pet06, chp 9, Lemma 34].
(cid:3)

Finally, we deﬁne what we mean by a weak Laplacian.

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

17

Proposition 2.5 (existence of weak Laplacian). Let (M n, g) be a (not neces-
sarily complete) Riemannian manifold of dimension n ≥ 2. Consider a func-
tion b : M → R that is locally Lipschitz and whose Hessian is locally uniformly
bounded from below in the barrier sense. For example, the following two classes
of functions (which we will consider in this paper) satisfy these properties:

(1) Let F : (0,∞) → R be a smooth, non-increasing function, p ∈ M a
point and consider the function b(x) := F (d(x, p)). Then b satisﬁes these
properties on M \ {p}.
(2) Let (E,h·,·i) be a Euclidean vector bundle over M with a metric connec-
tion ∇E and let X ∈ C 2(M; E) a section of E. Then b := |X| satisﬁes
these properties on M

Then the gradient ∇b exists almost everywhere and for any vector ﬁeld Z ∈
c (M; T M) we have

C 1

ˆMhZ,∇bidg = −ˆM

(div Z)b dg.

(2.5)

Moreover, there is a unique signed measure µ△b on M of locally ﬁnite total

variation such that for any compactly supported ϕ ∈ C 2

c (M) we have

ˆM

b(x)△ϕ(x)dg(x) = −ˆMh∇b(x),∇ϕ(x)idg(x) = ˆM

ϕ(x)dµ△b(x).

(2.6)

Also, µ△b can be expressed as the diﬀerence of its positive and negative part,
µ△b = (µ△b)+ − (µ△b)−. The negative part (µ△b)− is absolutely continuous with
respect to dg. Lastly, dµ△b = (△b)dg wherever b is C 2.
If in example (1) the function F is non-decreasing, then similar statements
hold, which follow by replacing F by −F .
Proof. Let us ﬁrst show that the two classes of examples fall into the desired cate-
gory of functions. Consider ﬁrst example (1), i.e. b(x) = F (d(x, p)). Obviously, b
is locally Lipschitz. Let U ⊂ M \{p} be an open subset that is relatively compact
in M \ {p}. We will now show that the Hessian of b is uniformly bounded from
below on U. To do this choose r > 0 small enough such that the tubular neigh-
borhood B(U, 3r) is still relatively compact in M \{p}, such that |Rm| < r−2/10
and inj > 2r on B(U, r). Let x ∈ U. By Lemma 2.1 there is a point y ∈ M such
that

d(y, x) = r

and

d(x, p) = d(x, y) + d(y, p).

By the triangle inequality, we have for all z ∈ M

b(z) = F (d(z, p)) ≥ F(cid:0)d(z, y) + d(y, p)(cid:1) =: b∗

y(z).

Moreover, b∗
y(x) = b(x). For z close to x we have d(y, z) < 2r and hence the
function b∗
y(z) is a C 2 barrier for b at x. Its Hessian can be bounded from above
using the sectional curvature bound on B(U, 3r). This shows that the desired
fact.

18

RICHARD H BAMLER

To see that the functions from example (2), i.e. b = |X|, fall in the desired

category, observe that any such b can be expressed as a limit of C 2 functions:

We can now check that

b = lim

ε→0p|X|2 + ε.

uniform lower bounds on the Hessian (in the barrier sense). These properties
pass to the limit.

So the approximators p|X|2 + ε are locally uniformly Lipschitz and have local
We will now focus on the main part of the proof. Let U ⊂ M be an open
subset that is relatively compact in M and on which we can ﬁnd coordinates
(x1, . . . , xn) : U → V ⊂ Rn. Moreover let U ′ ⊂ U be an open subsets such that
U ′ ⊂ U and U ′′ ⊂ U ′ an open subset such that U ′′ ⊂ U ′. We will ﬁrst construct
µ△b on U ′′ such that (2.6) holds for all ϕ ∈ C 2
As b is Lipschitz on U and its Hessian is uniformly bounded from below in the
barrier sense, we ﬁnd a constant C1 < ∞ such that if we express b = b(x1, . . . , xn)
in terms of the coordinates, then b is C1-Lipschitz and its Hessian is bounded

3. Convergence to a singular space and derived properties

In this section we prove Theorem 1.2. In the ﬁrst subsection we will show that
the limit of any sequence of Riemannian manifolds that satisfy the properties of
subsection 1.2 is a singular space that has mild singularities of a certain codimen-
sion. In the second and third subsection, we will then verify the Y -tameness and
Y -regularity properties of the limit.

3.1. Convergence to a singular space. In this subsection we will prove the
following result, which is a more detailed version of Theorem 1.2 minus assertions
(b) and (c), which state the Y -tameness and Y -regularity properties.
Theorem 3.1. Let {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
i=1 be a sequence of pointed, complete Riemann-
ian manifolds, each with bounded curvature that converge to a metric space (X,
dX , q∞) in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorﬀ sense. Assume that {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
i=1
satisﬁes properties (A)–(C) of subsection 1.2 for some constant p0 > 0. Then the
limit space (X, dX) is part of a singular space X = (X, dX,R, g) in the sense of
Deﬁnition 1.7, with singularities of codimension p0, in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.9.
Moreover, after passing to a subsequence, we have convergence of {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
i=1
to (X , q∞) according to some convergence scheme {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞
i=1 (in the sense
of Deﬁnition 1.11) such that:

(a) For any x ∈ R and r > 0 we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ lim inf

i→∞ (cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(x), r)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ lim sup

i→∞ (cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(x), r)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12).

Rm(x) ≤ lim inf

(b) For any x ∈ R we have

If the sequence {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
then X has mild singularities in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.8.
Proof. By assumption the pointed metric spaces (Mi, dMi, qi) converge to (X, dX,
q∞) in the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ sense. This means that there are sequences εi → 0,
Ri → ∞ and maps Ψi : BX (q∞, Ri) → Mi such that the following holds:

i=1 additionally satisﬁes property (E) of subsection 1.2,

(2) For any x, y ∈ BX (q∞, Ri) we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)dMi(Ψi(x), Ψi(y)) − dX(x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) < εi.

dMi(Ψi(z∗), z) < εi.

Claim 1. We may pass to a subsequence such that one of the following is true:
Rm(qi) = ∞
Rm(Ψi(x)) exists for all x ∈ X. Moreover, h is 1-

(3) For any i and any z ∈ BMi(qi, Ri) there is a z∗ ∈ BX(q∞, Ri) such that
We will now pass to a subsequence such that the functions erMi
Rm(·) converge to a
Either (X, dX) is isometric to Euclidean space (Rn, deucl) and limi→∞erMi
or the limit h(x) := limi→∞erMi
Proof. Since erMi
Rm(·) is 1-Lipschitz with respect to dMi we have for all x, y ∈ X
(cid:12)(cid:12)erMi
Rm(Ψi(x)) −erMi

Rm(Ψi(y))(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ dMi(Ψi(x), Ψi(y)) < dX(x, y) + εi.

So the assertion follows from an Arzela-Ascoli type argument.

(cid:3)

Rm(qi) = ∞, we are done. So assume in the
R := h−1((0,∞)).

In the case in which limi→∞erMi
following that h : X → [0,∞) exists. Then we deﬁne
By continuity of h it follows that the subset R is open. Using the non-collapsing
property (A) from subsection 1.2, we conclude that R can be equipped with the
structure of a diﬀerentiable manifold of regularity C 4, whose topology coincides
with the topology induced by the metric dX and we can ﬁnd a C 3-Riemannian
metric g on R such that dX|R is locally equal to the length metric of (R, g). More
speciﬁcally, for any p ∈ R there is an open neighborhood p ∈ U ⊂ R such that
the length metric of (R, g) restricted to U is equal to dX|U . Note that this implies
that for any C 1-curve γ : [0, 1] → R we have ℓg(γ) ≥ dX(γ(0), γ(1)), where ℓg(γ)
denotes the length of γ with respect to g.
Claim 2. R is dense in (X, dX).
Proof. Assume not and pick a point p ∈ X and an r > 0 such that h ≡ 0 on
BX (p, r) ⊂ X. Let ε > 0 and choose an ε-net x1, . . . , xN ∈ BX (p, r). It follows
that for large i the points Ψi(x1), . . . , Ψi(xn) form a 2ε-net of BMi(Ψi(p), r).
Moreover, for large i, we have erMi
Rm(Ψi(xj)) < ε for all j = 1, . . . , N. Since erMi
Rm(·)
is 1-Lipschitz with respect to dMi, we ﬁnd that erMi
Rm(·) < 3ε on BMi(Ψi(p), r) for
large i. Choosing ε small enough, this, however, contradicts properties (A) and
(B) of subsection 1.2.
(cid:3)
We have shown that X := (X, dX,R, g) satisﬁes all properties (1)–(3) of the
Deﬁnition of a singular space (see Deﬁnition 1.7). Using a center of gravity
construction, and by passing to another subsequence, it is possible to show the
existence of a scheme {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞
i=1 for the convergence (Mi, gi, qi) to (X , q∞)
(in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.11). We may also assume that this scheme approx-
imates Ψi in the following sense: There is a sequence ε′
i → 0 such that for all i

22

RICHARD H BAMLER

and x ∈ Ui ∩ BX (q∞, Ri) we have dMi(Ψi(x), Φi(x)) < ε′
i. Note that, formally,
the deﬁnition of a convergence scheme requires the limiting space to be a singular
space in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.7, meaning that it has to satisfy properties (4)
and (5) of this deﬁnition as well. However, even without these properties, the
deﬁnition of a convergence scheme still makes sense.

Claim 3. For any r > 0 we have

sup

x∈BX (q∞,r)∩Ui(cid:12)(cid:12)h(x) −erMi

Rm(Φi(x))(cid:12)(cid:12) → 0

Proof. This follows from the fact that Φi approximates Ψi, that erMi
Lipschitz and that erMi

Rm(·) is 1-
Rm(Ψi(·)) converges to h uniformly on compact subsets of

have

(cid:3)

erMi
Rm(·) < σ

on

BMi(qi, r) \ Vi.

Proof. Assume that this was wrong for some r, σ > 0. Then, after passing to a
subsequence, there is a sequence of points xi ∈ BMi(qi, r)\ Vi such thaterMi
Rm(xi) ≥
σ for all i. By the deﬁnition of a convergence scheme (see Deﬁnition 1.11(5)), we
can pick a sequence yi ∈ Vi such that dMi(xi, yi) → 0. So erMi
Rm(yi) > σ/2 for large
i. Choose zi ∈ Ui such that Φi(zi) = yi. By local compactness, we can pass to a
subsequence and assume that zi → z∞ ∈ X. By Claim 3, we have h(zi) > σ/4
for large i and hence h(z∞) ≥ σ/4 > 0. Thus z∞ ∈ R and so there is a δ > 0
such that BX (z∞, 2δ) ⊂ Ui for large i. As Φ∗
i gi → g in C 3 on BX(z∞, 2δ), we ﬁnd
that

BMi(Φi(z∞), δ) ⊂ Φi(BX (z∞, 2δ)) ⊂ Φi(Ui) = Vi

for large i. But dMi(Φi(z∞), xi) ≤ dMi(Φi(z∞), Φi(zi)) + dMi(Φi(zi), xi) → 0
as i → ∞, which implies that for large i we have xi ∈ BMi(Φi(z∞), δ) ⊂ Vi,
contradicting our assumptions.

(cid:3)

Note that assertion (c) of this theorem holds due to Claim 4 and a compactness

argument.
Claim 5. For any x, y ∈ R and ε > 0 there is a C 1-curve γ : [0, 1] → R between
x, y, such that ℓ(γ) < d(x, y) + ε. In other words, (X, dX) is the completion of
the length metric on (R, g) and X satisﬁes property (4) of Deﬁnition 1.7.
Proof. Let x, y ∈ R and choose 0 < σ0 < min{h(x), h(y)}. Let xi := Φi(x), yi :=
Rm(xi),erMi
Φi(y) ∈ Mi for large i. ThenerMi
Rm(yi) > σ0 and dMi(xi, yi) < dX(x, y)+ε/4
for large i. By property (C) from subsection 1.2, there is a uniform σ > 0 and
a sequence of curves γi : [0, 1] → Mi between xi, yi such that for large i we have
ℓgi(γi) < dX(x, y)+ε/2 and such thaterMi
Rm(γi(s)) > σ for all [0, 1]. By Claim 3, we
have γi([0, 1]) ⊂ Vi for large i. So for large i, the curve Φ−1
i ◦ γi : [0, 1] → Ui ⊂ R
between x, y has length < dX(x, y) + ε. This proves the claim.

(cid:3)

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

23

Claim 6. Assertion (b) of this theorem holds and we have r∞
Proof. First note that if x ∈ X \ R, then by deﬁnition h(x) = 0 and r∞
Rm(x) = 0.
So in this case, there is nothing to show. Next, for any x ∈ R, the ﬁrst inequality
and the equality in assertion (b) holds because the lim inf and lim sup are equal
to h.

Rm ≥ h.

We now show that r∞

Rm ≥ h, which implies the second inequality in asser-
tion (b). Pick x ∈ R arbitrarily and observe that h(x) > 0. Since h is 1-
Lipschitz, we have BX (x, h(x)) ⊂ R. Moreover, for all y ∈ BX (x, h(x)) we have
dMi(Φi(x), Φi(y)) < rMi

|Rm|(y) = lim

Similarly, we obtain

Rm(Φi(x)) for inﬁnitely many i and
i→∞|Rm|(Φi(y)) ≤ lim inf

Rm(Φi(x))(cid:1)−2

i→∞ (cid:0)rMi
|∇ Rm|(y) ≤ h−3(x).

= h−2(x).

Rm(x) ≥ h(x).

This implies that for all x ∈ R we have r∞
Next let h∗(x) := lim inf i→∞ rMi
Rm(Φi(x)) for all x ∈ R. It remains to prove that
Rm ≤ h∗ on R. Pick x ∈ R arbitrarily and observe that r∞
r∞
Rm(x) > 0. Choose
Rm(x). Then the closure of BX (x, r) is compact and contained in R
0 < r < r∞
and we have |Rm| < r−2 on BX(x, r). So for large i we have BX (x, r) ⊂ Ui and
for any δ > 0 we have, for large i, that BMi(Φi(x), r − δ) ⊂ Φi(BX(x, r)) and
|Rm| < (r − δ)−2 on Φi(BX (x, r)). So for large i, we have rMi
Rm(Φi(x)) ≥ r − δ.
Passing to the limit and using Claim 3, implies that h∗(x) ≥ r−δ. Letting δ → 0,
proves the desired result.
Claim 7. For any x ∈ X and any r > 0 we have

(cid:3)

(cid:12)(cid:12)BX(x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ lim inf

i→∞ (cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(x), r)(cid:12)(cid:12)

So assertion (a) of this theorem holds.

Proof. We ﬁrst show the ﬁrst inequality. By the fact that

it suﬃces to show that for all δ > 0 we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)BX(x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) = lim
δ→0(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (x, r − δ) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12),
i→∞ (cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(x), 0, r)(cid:12)(cid:12).
(cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(x, r − δ) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ lim inf
Φi(cid:0)Ui ∩ BX(x, r − δ)(cid:1) ⊂ BMi(Φi(x), r).
(cid:12)(cid:12)Ui ∩ BX (x, r − δ)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ (1 + ηi)(cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(x), r)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i=1 Ui = R, we obtain (3.1).

Note that for large i we have

BMi(Φi(x), r) \ Vi ⊂ {erMi

Rm(·) < σ}

Then, as before, we can conclude that for large i

for some ηi → 0. So we need to show that

To see this, observe that by Claim 4, for any σ > 0 we have

(3.2)

for suﬃciently large i. So (3.2) follows using property (B) of subsection 1.2. (cid:3)

Using Claim 7 and property (A) of subsection 1.2, we obtain:

Claim 8. For any D < ∞ there are constants κ1 = κ1(D), κ2 = κ2(D) > 0 such
that for all x ∈ BX (q∞, D) and 0 < r < D we have

κ1rn <(cid:12)(cid:12)BX(x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) < κ2rn.

In other words, X = (X, dX ,R, g) satisﬁes property (5) of Deﬁnition 1.7.

It follows that X := (X, dX,R, g) is a singular space in the sense of Deﬁni-

tion 1.7.
Claim 9. For any x ∈ X and r0 > 0 there is an Ex,r0 < ∞ such that for any
0 < r < r0 and 0 < s < 1 we have

Rm < sr} ∩ BX (x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Ex,r0sp0rn.
(cid:12)(cid:12){r∞

So X has singularities of codimension p0.
Proof. Fix 0 < r < r0, 0 < s < 1 and let δ > 0 be some small constant. Then, by
compactness, we have for some large i that

Rm(·) < sr + δ}(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Ex,r0(s + δr−1)p0rn.

So, using property (B) from subsection 1.2, we can ﬁnd a constant Ex,r0 < ∞
such that for large i

It only remains to establish the mildness of the singularities of X assuming
i=1 satisﬁes property (E) in subsection 1.2. So assume for the

that {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
remainder of the proof that property (E) holds.
Claim 10. Let x ∈ R and r, δ > 0. Then there is a σ = σ(x, r, δ) > 0 and a
sequence of numbers ηi → 0 and a sequence of open subsets Si ⊂ BX(x, r) ∩ R
such that for large i we have

and such that for any y ∈ Si there is a C 1-curve γ : [0, 1] → R between x, y,
γ(0) = x, γ(1) = y such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(BX (x, r) ∩ R) \ Si(cid:12)(cid:12) < δ

ℓg(γ) < dX(x, y) + ηi

and

r∞
Rm(γ(s)) > σ

for all

s ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. This is a direct consequence of property (E) in subsection 1.2.
Claim 11. Let x ∈ R and r, δ > 0. Then there is a σ = σ(x, r, δ) > 0 and a
subset S∗

(cid:3)

x,r,δ ⊂ BX(x, r) ∩ R such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(BX (x, r) ∩ R) \ S∗

(3.3)
x,r,δ there is a sequence γi : [0, 1] → R of C 1-curves

x,r,δ(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ δ

and such that for any y ∈ S∗

lim inf
i→∞

ℓg(γi) = dX(x, y)

and such that for all i we have

r∞
Rm(γi(s)) > σ

for all

s ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. We can construct S∗
x,r,δ as follows: Let S1, S2, . . . be the subsets from
x,r,δ be the set of all points y ∈ BX(x, r) ∩ R such that y ∈ Si
Claim 10 and let S∗
for inﬁnitely many i. It remains to prove (3.3). To see this bound, observe that

(cid:0)BX (x, r) ∩ R(cid:1) \ S∗

x,r,δ =

∞[j=1

∞\i=j(cid:0)(cid:0)BX(x, r) ∩ R(cid:1) \ Si(cid:1).

The subset

∞\i=j(cid:0)(cid:0)BX (x, r) ∩ R(cid:1) \ Si(cid:1)

has measure bounded by δ for each j and it is monotone in j. So the union of
these subsets has measure bounded by δ as well.
(cid:3)

We now claim that for any y ∈ S∗

x,r,δ there is in fact a minimizing geodesic
γ : [0, 1] → R between x, y whose image is contained in R. To see this, observe
that by Claim 11 and compactness of {r∞
Rm ≥ σ} ∩ BX (x, r), for any 0 = s0 <
s1 < . . . < sm = 1 there are points z0, . . . , zm ∈ {r∞
Rm ≥ σ} ∩ BX (x, r) ⊂ R such
that

dX(x, z1) + dX(z1, z2) + . . . + dX(zm−1, y) = dX(x, y)

and such that

dX(zk−1, zk) = (sk − sk−1)dX(x, y)

for all

k = 1, . . . , m.

(3.4)

The parameters s1, . . . , sm−1 can be chosen such that we have

dX(zk−1, zk) < σ ≤ r∞

Rm(zk−1)

for all

k = 1, . . . , m.

So we can choose minimizing geodesics between zk−1, zk for each such k. Their
concatenation is a minimizing geodesic between x, y due to (3.4), which proves
our claim.

Consider now the Riemannian manifold (R, g) and deﬁne Gx,G∗

x,r,δ ⊂ Gx.

It follows using (3.3) that R \ Gx has zero measure. By Proposition 2.3(c), the
complement Gx \ G∗
x has zero measure as well and by Proposition 2.3, the subset

x is open. So Qx := R \ G∗

(X, dX ,R, g, q∞) from Theorem 3.1. Assume that {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
i=1 satisﬁes the
properties (A)–(F) from subsection 1.2 for the constants A, p0 and for some con-
stant T > 0. Then X is Y -tame at scale c√T .

We will split the proof of Theorem 3.2 into several parts, in which we establish
the assumptions in Deﬁnition 1.10 of tameness separately. In each part we con-
sider the setting of Theorem 3.2 and, in particular, we ﬁx a convergence scheme
{(Ui, Vi, Φi}∞
i=1.
Proof of item (1) of the Y -tameness properties in Theorem 3.2. This is a direct
consequence of property (A) from subsection 1.2 and Theorem 3.1(a).
(cid:3)

In order to show items (2) and (3) of the Y -tameness properties, we need the

following lemma.
Lemma 3.3. There is a constant C ∗ < ∞ and for any p0 > 1 and A, E < ∞
there is a constant C = C(p0, A, E) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Let (M, g) be a complete, n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with bounded
curvature, p ∈ M a point and a, D > 0 numbers and assume that
(i) For all x ∈ B(p, 2D) and 0 < r < 2a we have A−1rn < |B(x, r)| < Arn.
(ii) For any x ∈ B(p, 2D), 0 < r < 2a and 0 < s < 1 we have

|{erRm < sr} ∩ B(x, r)| < Esp0rn.

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

Set b(x) := d(x, p) and denote by µ△b the signed measure from Proposition 2.5.

Then we have the following estimates:

(a) In the weak sense, we have for all x ∈ M \ {p}
dµ△b(x) < C ∗(cid:0) min{rRm(x), b(x)}(cid:1)−1

dg.

(3.5)

(b) For any 0 < r ≤ a and y ∈ B(p, D) such that d(p, y) > 2r we have

ˆB(y,r)

d|µ△b| < Crn−1

and for any 0 < s < 1 we have

ˆB(y,r)∩{erRm<sr}

d|µ△b| < Csp0−1rn−1

(3.6)

(3.7)

(c) Assume that n ≥ 3 and denote by dµ△b2−n the weak Laplacian of b2−n, as
introduced in Proposition 2.5. Let 0 < r < a and consider an open subset
U ⊂ B(p, r) \ {p} such that along any minimizing geodesic from p to any
point in U, we have Ric ≥ −(n − 1)κ for some κ ≥ 0 with κr2 ≤ 100.

Proof. For assertion (a) we argue as follows: By Proposition 2.5, the positive part
(µ△b)+ is absolutely continuous with respect to dg and by Proposition 2.3, the
function b is smooth almost everywhere. So it suﬃces to check (3.5) wherever
b is smooth. Fix x ∈ M \ {p} such that b is smooth at x, let z ∈ M be a
point on a minimizing geodesic γ : [0, 1] → M between p, x such that d(x, z) =
10 min{rRm(x), b(x)} and set b′(x′) := d(x′, z) + d(z, p) for any x′ ∈ M. Then
x, z are not conjugate to each other along γ and by Laplace comparison we have
△b′(x) < C ′d−1(x, z) for some universal constant C ′ < ∞. By the triangle
inequality, we have b′ ≥ b and b′(x) = b(x). So also △b(x) < C ′d−1(x, z), which
proves our claim.
To see assertion (b), we ﬁrst compute the integral of dµ△ over a slightly larger
ball. Let ϕ ∈ C ∞
c (B(y, 1.5r)) be a cutoﬀ function taking values between 0 and
1 such that ϕ ≡ 1 on B(y, r) and |∇ϕ| < 10r−1 everywhere. Then, by Proposi-
tion 2.5, we get

for some generic constant C = C(A) < ∞. Consider now the positive part (µ△b)+
of the signed measure µ△b. Then we can estimate, using (3.5) and the fact that

To see (3.7), we choose points z1, . . . , zN ∈ B(y, r) ∩ {erRm < sr} where N is
wise disjoint. Since erRm(·) is 1-Lipschitz, we have

maximal with the property that the balls B(z1, sr/2), . . . , B(zN , sr/2) are pair-

B(z1, sr/2) ∪ . . . ∪ B(zN , sr/2) ⊂ B(y, 2r) ∩ {erRm < 2sr}.

Using assumption (i) and

we can ﬁnd a constants c = c(A) > 0 and C0 = C0(A, E) < ∞ such that

as long as κb2 ≤ 10, we have

△b2−n ≥ −C ∗κb2−n

|hi − bi| ≤ 2r.

We now claim that for large i

ˆΩi |∇(hi − bi)|2dgi = ˆΩi

(hi − bi)dµ△bi.

To see this, ﬁx some large i and observe that

ˆΩi |∇(hi − bi)|2dgi ≤ 2ˆΩi |∇hi|2dgi + 2ˆΩi |∇bi|2dgi < ∞.

(3.12)

(3.13)

So since hi− bi vanishes on ∂Ωi, we can ﬁnd a sequence ϕj ∈ C 2
c (Ωi) of compactly
supported smoothings of (hi − bi) that converge to hi − bi in C 0 and in W 1,2.
Then, using Proposition 2.5, we have
ˆΩi ∇(hi − bi) · ∇ϕjdgi = ˆΩi ∇hi · ∇ϕjdgi − ˆΩi ∇bi · ∇ϕjdgi = ˆΩi
Taking the limit j → ∞ on both sides yields (3.13).
We will now estimate the L2-norm of hi − bi using the log-Sobolev inequality
from property (D) of subsection 1.2, which states that for any i, any 0 < τ ≤ 2T
and for any f ∈ C 1(Mi) with the property that

ˆMi

(4πτ )−n/2e−f dgi = 1

we have the bound

ˆMi

(τ|∇f|2 + f )(4πτ )−n/2e−f dgi > −A.

So if v ∈ C 1(Mi) is a positive function with

ˆMi

v2dgi = 1,

then choosing f = − n

2 log(4πτ ) − log(v2) yields

So

v2dgi = 1 and hence v satisﬁes (3.14). Moreover, by Jensen’s inequality

log(v2)v2dgi = ˆΩi

log(v2)v2dgi ≥ |Ωi| · log(cid:0)|Ωi|−1(cid:1)|Ωi|−1 = − log |Ωi|.

Let us summarize our results so far. We have found that there is a constant

We will now pass to the limit as i → ∞ to obtain the desired h ∈ C 3(BX(p, r)∩R).
To do this, observe ﬁrst that khikL∞(Ωi) is uniformly bounded. So by local elliptic
regularity an the local bounds onerRm, the ﬁrst, second, third and fourth derivative
of the sequence hi ◦ Φi are locally uniformly bounded. So, after passing to a
subsequence, the sequence hi ◦ Φi converges to some harmonic h ∈ C 3(BX (p, r)∩

To see this, assume that the left-hand side of (3.19) is positive, ﬁx some small
δ > 0 and choose a vector ﬁeld Z ∈ C 2
c (B(p, r) ∩ R), approximating ∇(h − b)
well enough such that the following inequality holds

Let (M, g) be a complete Riemannian manifold of dimension n ≥ 3, let p ∈ M

We will now show that the limit on the right-hand side is bounded by Cκr2

for some constant C = C(A, p0) < ∞. To see this, ﬁx some compact subset
K ⊂ (BX (p, 3r2) ∩ R) \ Qp. Then K ⊂ Ui for large i. We ﬁrst show:
Claim. There is a constant σ = σ(K) > 0 such that for large i the following
is true: For any x ∈ K, the image of any minimizing geodesic γ : [0, l] → Mi
between pi and Φi(x) is contained in {erMi
Proof. Note ﬁrst, that by Theorem 3.1(c) there is a sequence σi → 0 such that
for large i
BMi(pi, 3r2) ∩ {erMi

Fix this sequence for the rest of the proof. For large i we have Φi(K) ⊂
BMi(pi, 3r2), so any minimizing geodesic between pi and a point in Φi(K) is
contained in BMi(pi, 3r2).

Assume now that the claim was wrong. Then, after passing to a subsequence,
we can ﬁnd a sequence xi ∈ K of points and a sequence of minimizing arclength
geodesics γi : [0, li] → Mi between pi and Φi(xi) that are each not fully contained
in {erMi
Rm > σi}. By passing to a subsequence, we may assume that xi → x∞ ∈ K
and that l∞ := limi→∞ li exists. Let 0 < ai ≤ li each be maximal with the
property that we have γi([li− ai, li]) ⊂ {erMi
Rm(γi(li− a)) = σi. Since
erMi
Rm(·) is 1-Lipschitz, it follows that for any ε > 0
Rm(γi(li − ai + ε)) ≤ lim
After passing to another subsequence, we may assume that a∞ := limi→∞ ai ∈
[0, l∞] exists and that we have uniform convergence of the curves Φ−1
i ◦ γi|[li−ai,li]
to some continuous curve γ∞ : (l∞ − a∞, l∞] → R with γ∞(l∞) = x∞. Note that
a∞ > 0 since by Theorem 3.1(b)

For any s1, s2 ∈ (l∞ − a∞, l∞], we have

σi + ε = ε.

i→∞

(3.31)

So γ∞ is a minimizing geodesic. Similarly, for any s ∈ (l∞ − a∞, l∞], we have

dX(p, γ∞(s)) + dX(γ∞(s), x∞) = d(p, x∞).

Next, we show that limsցl∞−a∞ γ∞(s) 6∈ R and thus a∞ < l∞. Assume that it
did and denote this limit by z ∈ R. Then, using Theorem 3.1(b) and (3.31), we

38

RICHARD H BAMLER

get that for all ε > 0

0 < lim sup

Rm(Φi(z))

i→∞ erMi

≤ lim sup

i→∞ (cid:0)erMi

This gives us the desired contradiction.

Rm(γi(li − ai + ε)) + dMi(γi(li − ai + ε), Φi(z))(cid:1) ≤ 2ε.
Since x∞ ∈ K is not in Qp ∪ {p}, and Qp ∪ {p} is closed, we can pick some
0 < b < a∞ such that γ∞(l∞ − b) ∈ R \ (Qp ∪ {p}). So there is a minimizing
arclength geodesic γ∗ : [0, l∞ − b] → R between p and γ∞(l∞ − b) whose image is
contained in R. It follows that
ℓg(γ∗) + ℓg(γ∞|[l∞−b,l∞]) = dX(p, γ∞(l∞ − b)) + dX(γ∞(l∞ − b), x∞) = dX(p, x∞).
So the concatenation of γ∗ and γ∞|[l∞−b,l∞] is a minimizing geodesic between p
and x∞ and hence smooth. It follows that γ∗ = γ∞ on (l∞ − a∞, l∞ − b], which
contradicts limsցl∞−a∞ γ∞(s) 6∈ R.

(cid:3)

Fix now σ > 0 from the Claim and let κ′ > κ be some constant that is
slightly larger than κ. Then, since by assumption we have Ric ≥ −(n − 1)κ on
B(p, 4r2) ∩ R, we must have Ric ≥ −(n − 1)κ′ on {erMi
Rm > σ} ∩ BX(p, 3r2) for
large i. By the Claim, property (A) from subsection 1.2 and Lemma 3.3(c), this
implies that for some C = C(A) < ∞ and large i we have
d(µ△bi)− ≤ Cκ′(3r2)2.

ˆΦi(K)\{pi}

This implies

lim sup

i→∞ ˆΦi(K)\{pi}

d(µ△bi)− ≤ Cκr2

(3.32)

Next we will show that

lim sup

i→∞ ˆBMi (pi,2r2)\Φi(K)

d(µ△bi)−

can be made arbitrarily small if K is chosen to approximate (BX (p, 3r2)∩R)\ Qp
well enough. To see this, observe ﬁrst that wherever dMi(·, pi) is C 2, we have
△bi = (n − 2)(n − 1)(cid:0)dMi(·, pi)(cid:1)−n − (n − 2)△dMi(·, pi)(cid:0)dMi(·, pi)(cid:1)1−n
.

So, as d(µ△bi)− is absolutely continuous with respect to dgi, we have

d(µ△bi)− ≤ (n − 2)(cid:0)dMi(·, pi)(cid:1)1−nd(µ△dMi (·,pi))+.

(3.33)

Using Lemma 3.3(b), we can conclude from this that there is some constant
C ′
1 < ∞, which is independent of i, such that for all ν, σ0 > 0 and all i we have

On the other hand, (3.33) and the pointwise bound of Lemma 3.3(a) implies that
there is a constant C ′

BMi(pi, 0, 2ν) ⊂ Φi(BX (p, 3ν)) for large i. Combining (3.34) and (3.35), we ﬁnd
that for any compact subset

We now claim that we can make the sum of the last two terms on the right-hand
side of this inequality arbitrarily small. To see this, choose σ0 > 0 such that
1ν1−nσp0−1
C ′
is small. Next, since K ⊂ (BX (p, 4r2) ∩ R) \ Qp can be chosen
arbitrarily and Qp has measure 0, we may choose K such that BX (p, 0, 3ν) ⊂ K
and such that |(BX (p, 3r2) ∩ R) \ K| is arbitrarily small. This makes the second
term on the right-hand side of (3.36) small. So we conclude that

(3.37)

The rest of the proof now follows along the lines of the proof of item (2) of the
tameness assumptions. We will now go through the main steps of this proof and
point out the major diﬀerences. Similarly to (3.11) let Ωi ⊂ Mi be smooth and
connected domains such that for some εi → 0 we have

AMi(pi, r1 + εi, r2 − εi) ⊂ Ωi ⊂ AMi(pi, r1 − εi, r2 + εi)

and let hi ∈ C ∞(Int Ωi) ∩ C 0(Ωi) be solutions to the Dirichlet problem

△hi = 0 on Ωi

and

hi = bi

on ∂Ωi.

(3.39)

The harmonic function h ∈ C 3(AX (p, r1, r2) ∩ R) can now be constructed by
passing to the limit, as in the proof of part (2) of the Y -tameness properties.
The bounds (1.3) and (1.4) follow from (3.38), (3.39) via (3.37) using a similar
limit argument as in that proof. Note that (3.20) in this proof is replaced by
(3.37).
(cid:3)

Proof of item (4) of the Y -tameness properties in Theorem 3.2. We ﬁrst establish
the following improvement of property (F) from subsection 1.2: There is a con-
stant C = C(A) < ∞ such that for all D < ∞ and suﬃciently large i (depending
on D) the following holds: For all 0 < r < √T and all x ∈ BMi(qi, D) there is
c (BMi(x, 0.9r)) that only takes values in
a compactly supported function φ ∈ C ∞
[0, 1], that satisﬁes φ ≡ 1 on BMi(x, 0.6r) and that satisﬁes the bounds

|∇φ| < Cr−1

and

|△φ| < Cr−2.

To see this, assume without loss of generality that A > 10 and choose a maximal
number of points z1, . . . , zN ∈ BMi(x, 0.6r) such that the balls BMi(z1, 1
8 r/A), . . . ,
BMi(zN , 1
8r/A) are pairwise disjoint. Then, using property (A) of subsection 1.2
for suﬃciently large i, we have

N ≤ |BMi(x, r)|

φ∗ := φ1 + . . . + φN

Then φ∗ ≥ 1 on BMi(x, 0.6r) and supp φ∗ ⊂ BMi(x, 0.8r) and
|△φ∗| < AN(cid:0) 1

|∇φ∗| < AN(cid:0) 1

4r(cid:1)−1

and

4r(cid:1)−2

.

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

41

Let now F : [0,∞) → [0, 1] be a smooth function such that F ≡ 1 on [1,∞) and
F ≡ 0 on [0, 1/2]. Then φ := F ◦ φ∗ satisﬁes the desired properties for a proper
choice of C.
Item (4) of the Y -tameness properties is a direct consequence of this improved
(cid:3)

version of property (F).

For item (5) of the tameness properties, we need the following heat kernel

bound:

Lemma 3.5. For any A < ∞ and δ > 0 there is a constant Cδ = Cδ(A) < ∞
such that the following holds:
Let (M, g) be a complete n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with bounded
curvature, let T > 0 and assume that for any 0 < τ ≤ T and any function
f ∈ C ∞(M) with

ˆM

(4πτ )−n/2e−f dg = 1

we have

Let K(x, y, t) be the heat kernel on (M, g). Then for all x, y ∈ M and all 0 < t ≤
δT we have

ˆM(cid:0)τ|∇f|2 + f(cid:1)(4πτ )−n/2e−f dg > −A.

K(x, y, t) <

Cδ

tn/2 exp(cid:16) −

d2(x, y)

(1 + δ)t(cid:17).

Proof. The statement follows essentially from [Dav87], with a few modiﬁcations.
First we derive a log-Sobolev inequality as in [Dav87, Equation (1.4)] for small
scales. Consider a scale 0 < τ ≤ T and a positive function u ∈ C ∞(M), u > 0
with H := ´M u2dg < ∞ and choose f ∈ C ∞(M) such that

u

= (4πτ )−n/4e−f /2.

Then

and thus

Note that this inequality implies [Dav87, Equation (1.4)] with ε = 2τ and β(ε) =
A′ + n

The desired Gaussian bound now follows from [Dav87, Theorem 5]. The re-
striction that [Dav87, Equation (1.4)] only holds for 0 < ε ≤ 2T does not create
any issues as we explain in the following: The log-Sobolev inequality is only used
in [Dav87, Lemma 2]. The extra restriction implies that this lemma only holds
for 0 < ε ≤ 4T . In the proof of [Dav87, Theorem 3], this lemma is applied for
λ
all 0 < ε ≤ λt, where
λ−1 = 1 + δ. So we can only ensure that [Dav87, Theorem
3] holds for t ≤ 4λ−1T . Hence, [Dav87, Corollary 4], and consequently [Dav87,
Theorem 5], can only be ensured for all 0 < t ≤ 8λ−1T . Since we may assume
δ < 0.01, [Dav87, Theorem 5] holds for all t with 0 < t ≤ δT < 8λ−1T .
Proof of item (4) of the Y -tameness properties in Theorem 3.2. K is the limit of
the kernels of the heat equation with respect to the metrics gi. Properties (5a)
and (5b) follow immediately. The Gaussian bounds, property (5c), follow from

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.5. For property (5c) observe that ´R K(·, y, t)dg ≤ 1 is obvious. To

see the reverse inequality, observe that, by Lemma 3.5 and by property (A) in
subsection 1.2 and a similar reasoning as in [BZ15, Lemma 2.1], we have for any
D < ∞ and for suﬃciently large i:

for all x ∈ BMi(qi, D) and 0 < r < D, where C0 = C0(A) < ∞ is a constant,
which is independent of i. So, using Lemma 3.5 and Fubini’s Theorem, we ﬁnd
that for all D < ∞ we have the following estimate for suﬃciently large i: For all
0 < t ≤ T , 1 < r < D and x ∈ BMi(qi, D)

1.2, namely that under the assumption of property (G) of subsection 1.2 the limit
is Y -regular at scale √T for some Y = Y (A).

Theorem 3.6. For any A > 0 there is a Y = Y (A) < ∞ such that the following
holds:
Consider the sequence {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞
i=1 and the pointed limiting singular space
(X, dX ,R, g, q∞) from Theorem 3.1. Assume that {(Mi, gi, qi)}∞

for some constant T > 0. Then X is Y -regular at scale √T .
Proof. We claim that we have Y -regularity for any Y < A. Let p ∈ X and
0 < r < √T and assume that

(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (p, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) > (ωn − A−1)rn.

By increasing r slightly, we may perturb p and assume that p ∈ R. By Theorem
3.1(a) we then have

lim inf

i→∞ (cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(p), r)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (p, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) > (ωn − 2−1)rn.

So for large i we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(p), r)(cid:12)(cid:12) > (ωn − 2−1)rn.
Using property (G) from subsection 1.2, we get that erMi
Rm(p) ≥ A−1r.

i. So, using Theorem 3.1(b), it follows that r∞

Rm(Φi(p)) > A−1r for large

4. Volume comparison

We now show that the volume comparison result of Bishop and Gromov also

holds for singular spaces with mild singularities.
Proposition 4.1 (volume comparison). Let X be a singular space with mild
singularities that satisﬁes Ric ≥ (n − 1)κ on R for some κ ∈ R and let p ∈ X
be a point. Then |B(p, r) ∩ R| depends continuously on p and r. Moreover, the
quantity

is non-increasing in r (as long as r ≤ π√κ if κ > 0) and

|B(p, r) ∩ R|

(4.2)

Consider the Riemannian manifold (R, g) and recall the subsets G∗

Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case in which p ∈ R and show (4.2). This will then
imply (4.1) for p ∈ R.
p ⊂ Gp ⊂ R
and D∗
p ⊂ Dp ⊂ TpR from Deﬁnition 2.2. Note that by the mildness assumption
we have Qp ∪ Gp = R and we know that U := R \ Qp ⊂ Gp is open. Using
Proposition 2.3(c), we ﬁnd that R \ (U ∩ G∗
p) ∪ Qp has measure zero
and Proposition 2.3(b), (d) implies that

p) = (Gp \ G∗

expp |U ′ : U ′ := exp−1

p −→ U ∩ G∗
is a (bijective) diﬀeomorphism. In particular, the complement D∗
G∗
p ) ∪ Qp) also has measure zero.
Let Jp : D∗
p := JpχD∗
easy to verify, using Proposition 2.4, that the quantity

p → R be the Jacobian of expp. Set J ∗

So, in order to verify the monotonicity of (4.1), it suﬃces to check that

J ∗
p (v)dv

|v| = 1, the quantity

1

is non-increasing in r1 and r2. The rest follows via Fubini’s theorem. To see
the monotonicity of this quantity in r1, observe that its derivative in r1 can be
bounded as follows:

This shows the monotonicity of (4.2) and hence (4.1) in the case p ∈ R.
We will now show that |B(p, r)∩R| depends continuously on p ∈ X, as r > 0 is
kept ﬁxed. Let p1, p2 ∈ X and set d := d(p1, p2). Then B(p1, r − d) ⊂ B(p2, r) ⊂
B(p1, r + d). Assume ﬁrst that p1 ∈ R. Then, by our previous conclusion

+(cid:0) snκ(r2)(cid:1)n−1J ∗

|B(p1, r) ∩ R| ≤ |B(p1, r − d) ∩ R| ≤ |B(p2, r) ∩ R|
vκ(r + d)

≤ |B(p1, r + d) ∩ R| ≤

|B(p1, r) ∩ R|.
Letting p1 → p2 yields the continuity of |B(p, r) ∩ R| in p. The continuity in r
follows from volume comparison. The continuity of the volume |A(p, r1, r2) ∩ R|
of annuli in p, r1, r2 follows similarly.
Finally, the monotonicity of (4.2) and (4.1) for arbitrary p follows from the
(cid:3)

vκ(r)

continuity of the volume.

Next, we establish the Laplacian comparison theorem for distance functions on
singular spaces with mild singularities. Note in the following that the comparison
still holds in the weak sense at points that cannot be connected to the basepoint
by a regular geodesic.

46

RICHARD H BAMLER

Proposition 4.2. Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities
and let p ∈ R be a regular point. Assume that Ric ≥ (n − 1)κ on R. Then the
function b(x) := d(x, p) satisﬁes

dµ△b ≤ (n − 1)

on R \ {p}.
Proof. By Proposition 2.5, the positive part (µ△b)+ is absolutely continuous with
respect to dg. As such, it suﬃces to show that (4.3) holds away from sets of
measure 0. As (R \ G∗
p ) ∪ Qp has measure zero, it suﬃces to verify (4.3) on G∗
p ,
where b is C 2. This can be achieved using standard Riemannian geometry.
(cid:3)

5. Integration by parts

In this section we establish two results that will allow us to perform integration

by parts on singular spaces. We ﬁrst need the following technical lemma.
Lemma 5.1. Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with singularities of codi-
mension p0 > 1, let x ∈ X be a point, r > 0 a radius and 1 < p < p0. Then there
is a sequence of positive numbers si → 0 and an increasing sequence of subsets

such that the following holds:

U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ B(x, r) ∩ R

(a) Each Ui is closed in B(x, r) and the boundary portion ∂Ui ∩ B(x, r) of Ui
(b) We have

that is contained in B(x, r) is C 2.

∞[i=1

Int Ui = B(x, r) ∩ R

(c) We have

rRm > si

on

Ui

(d) There is a constant C < ∞, which is independent of i but which may

depend on x and r, such that for all i

Hn−1(∂Ui ∩ B(x, r)) < Csp−1

i

Here Hn−1 denotes the n − 1 dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure.

Proof. By deﬁnition the function rRm : R → (0,∞) is 1-Lipschitz. Let f : R →
(0,∞) be a smoothing of rRm|R such that

1

2rRm < f < 2rRm and |∇f| < 2

on

R.

By the coarea formula and Deﬁnition 1.9 we have for any 0 < s < 1

ˆ 2s
s Hn−1({f = s′} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R)ds′ = ˆ{s<f <2s}∩B(x,r)∩R |∇f|dg

≤ 2(cid:12)(cid:12){s < f < 2s} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12)
≤ 2(cid:12)(cid:12){ 1

2s < rRm < 4s} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 2 · 4pEp,x,rsp.

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

47

So we can choose s′ ∈ (s, 2s) such that {f = s′} ⊂ R is C 2 and such that

|{f = s′} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R| ≤ 4p+1Ep,x,rsp−1 < 4p+1Ep,x,r(s′)p−1.

It follows that we can ﬁnd a constant C < ∞ and a sequence si → 0 such that

|{f = 2si} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R| < Csp−1

i

.

So if we set Ui := {f ≥ 2si} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R, then assertions (a)–(d) hold.

(cid:3)

We can now state the ﬁrst main result of this section.

Proposition 5.2. Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with singularities of
codimension p0 > 2 and Z a continuously diﬀerentiable vector ﬁeld on R that
vanishes on R \ B(x, r) for some large r > 0. Assume that there is a constant
C < ∞ such that

|Z| < Cr−1

Rm and |div Z| < Cr−2

Rm

on

B(x, r) ∩ R.

Then

ˆR

(div Z)dg = 0.

Next, assume that f : R → R is a continuously diﬀerentiable function and
Z is a continuously diﬀerentiable vector ﬁeld on R such that f Z vanishes on
R \ B(x, r) for some large r > 0. Assume that |f| is uniformly bounded and that
there is some constant C < ∞ such that

|Z|,|∇f| < Cr−1

Then

Rm and |div Z| < Cr−2

on

B(x, r) ∩ R.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove the ﬁrst part. Consider the numbers si and the subsets
Ui from Lemma 5.1 applied to the ball B(x, 2r) for some 2 < p < p0. Then, for
some generic constant C∗ < ∞, which may depend on x, r and p, we have
ˆ{0<rRm<1} |div Z| =

C∗C(2−k)−2(2−k+1)p < ∞.

∞Xk=1

So

It follows that

div Z = lim

Sometimes we will have to carry out the limiting process in the proof of Propo-
sition 5.2 by hand in order to have better control on cutoﬀ functions. We will
then use the second main result of this section.
Proposition 5.3. Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with singularities of
codimension p0 > 1 and let x ∈ X, r > 0 and 1 < p < p0. Assume moreover
that is Y -tame at scale r for some Y > 0. Then there is a sequence of positive
numbers si → 0, a sequence of subsets Ui ⊂ B(x, r) ∩ R and a sequence of maps
φi : Ui → [0, 1] such that the following holds:
(a) Each Ui is closed in B(x, r) and ∂sUi := ∂Ui ∩ B(x, r) is C 2.
(b) U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ . . ..
(c) S∞
(d) rRm > si on Ui.
(e) Hn−1(∂sUi) < Csp−1
for some constant C < ∞, which is independent of
i, but which may depend on x, r. Here Hn−1 denotes the n−1 dimensional
Hausdorﬀ measure.
(f ) Each φi : Ui → [0, 1] is C 2 up to the boundary ∂sUi and has compact
(g) φi ≡ 1 on B(x, r/2) ∩ Ui for all i.
(h) |∇φi| < Y r−1 and |△φi| < Y r−2 for all i.

i

Proof. Consider the subsets Ui from Lemma 5.1 and the open subsets Ui and
φi : Ui → [0, 1] from Deﬁnition 1.12(4), which we will denote by U ′
i, in
order to avoid confusion. By compactness we can ﬁnd for each i = 1, 2, . . . some
ji = 1, 2, . . . such that U i ⊂ U ′
ji|Ui, then the proposition
follows.

6. Cheng-Yau gradient estimate

In this section we derive gradient estimates for bounded functions that are
harmonic or satisfy the heat equation on the regular part R of a singular space
X on which a lower Ricci curvature bound holds. These gradient estimates will
imply, in particular, that such functions are also continuous at the singular part
of X . In order to obtain our estimates, we will impose several conditions on the
singular space X . For example, we will assume that X is Y -tame and that X has
singularities of codimension p0 > 3.
Note that the standard proof by Cheng and Yau (see [CY75]), via maximum
principles, cannot be applied here as the maximum may be attained on the sin-
gular set X \ R of X , where we have no information on the functions under
investigation. Even worse, we don’t even assume a priori that we have continu-
ity at the singular set. We therefore carry out an integral version of the Cheng
and Yau’s proof. This proof is particularly adapted to the singular setting. In
the non-singular setting, the integral version of Cheng and Yau’s proof can be
simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly.

We remark that Corollary 6.3 is similar to [CW14, Proposition 2.14].

Lemma 6.1. There is a universal constant C < ∞ such that the following holds:

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

49

−r2/2ˆB(x,r/2)∩R |∇h|2(y, t)dg(y)dt ≤ C|B(x, r) ∩ R|(cid:16)
ˆ 0

Let X be a singular space with singularities of codimension p0 > 2, x ∈ X,
r > 0 and consider a C 2 function h : (B(x, r) ∩ R) × [−r2, 0] → R. Assume
that h that is uniformly bounded from above and below and that ∂th = △h on
(B(x, r) ∩ R) × [−r2, 0]. Then
h(cid:17)2
Proof. By standard parabolic regularity, there is a constant C∗ < ∞, which
depends on the L∞-bound of h, such that for all (y, t) ∈ (B(x, 3r/4) ∩ R) ×
[−3r2/4, 0] we have
|∇h|(y, t) < C∗(cid:0) min{rRm(y), r}(cid:1)−1
and |∇2h|(y, t) < C∗(cid:0) min{rRm(y), r}(cid:1)−2
.
(6.1)
Note that for the second bound we have used the fact that by Deﬁnition 1.1, of
the curvature radius, |∇ Rm| < r−3
Choose now 2 < p < p0. Using the bounds in (6.1), we get that for any
t ∈ [−3r2/4, 0] and for some generic constant C∗∗ < ∞, which may depend on X ,

(6.2)

Fix for the moment t ∈ [−3r2/4]. By smoothing the composition of the radial
distance function d(x,·) with a suitable cutoﬀ function, we can construct a func-
tion φ : X → [0, 2] with support in B(x, 3r/4) such that φ ≡ 1 on B(x, r/2), φ|R
is C 1 and |∇φ| < 10r−1 on R. Using Proposition 5.2 and writing h = h(·, t), we

Proposition 6.2. For any p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a C = C(p0, Y ) < ∞

and assume that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 on B(x, r) ∩ R. Assume moreover that X

In the case in which h is constant in time t, Proposition 6.2 implies the gradient

bound of Cheng and Yau for harmonic functions.
Corollary 6.3. For any p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a C = C(p0, Y ) < ∞ such
that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with singularities of codimension p0, x ∈ X, r > 0
and assume that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 on B(x, r) ∩ R. Assume moreover that X is

We will hence use the following terminology for the remainder of this paper:

Deﬁnition 6.4 (harmonic function on singular Ricci ﬂat space). Let X be a
singular space an U ⊂ X and open subset. A function h : U → R is called
harmonic if it is continuous on U and C 3 on U ∩ R and satisﬁes △h = 0 on
U ∩ R.

A direct consequence of Corollary 6.3 is

Corollary 6.5. Let X be a singular space with singularities of codimension p0 > 3
that is Y -tame at scale r for some Y, r > 0 and let U ⊂ X be an open subset.
Assume that Ric ≥ −C on U for some C < ∞. Consider a locally bounded
function h : U → R such that h is C 3 on U ∩R and satisﬁes △h = 0 there. Then
h is harmonic in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.4 and even locally Lipschitz.

Proof of Proposition 6.2. Note that by restricting our attention to a smaller par-
abolic neighborhood, it suﬃces to consider the case x ∈ R and to show that (6.3)
holds at (x, 0). For the remainder of this proof ﬁx a constant 3 < p < p0, a
constant 0 < α < 1/10 such that 3 + 2α < p and a constant β > 0 and set

f := (|∇h|2 + β)

For the remainder of the proof we will ﬁx α, p and β, except for the very end,
where we let β → 0. In the following, generic constants are allowed to depend on
α and p, but not on β.

7. Integral estimates along families of geodesics

In this section we reprove several integral estimates for families of geodesics on

singular spaces.
Deﬁnition 7.1. Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space. Consider the unit
tangent bundle SR consisting of all vectors v ∈ TR of norm |v| = 1. For any
v ∈ SR denote by γv : (−av, bv) → R be the arclength geodesic with γ′
v(0) = v
such that av, bv ∈ (0,∞] are maximal. We now deﬁne

S∗X := S∗R := {v ∈ SR : av = bv = ∞}

to be the subset of all unit vectors that evolve into inﬁnite geodesic lines. For any
subset U ⊂ X we furthermore set

S∗U := S∗R ∩ S(U ∩ R).

The standard measure on SR is the Liouville measure, i.e. the product measure
of (R, g) with the spherical measure of total mass 1 on each ﬁber and the standard
measure on S∗R is the restriction of this measure to SR.

Note that for any v ∈ S∗R the geodesic γv : R → R is deﬁned on all of R.

Lemma 7.2. Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0 > 1. Then the subset S∗R ⊂ SR is measurable and SR \ S∗R has measure
zero. Moreover, for any t ∈ R the ﬂow S∗R → S∗R, v 7→ γ′
v(t) is measure
preserving.

Proof. Note that

SR \ S∗R =

∞[k=1
{v ∈ SR : av, bv ≤ k}

(7.1)

is the union of closed sets and hence measurable. Let R > 0 be ﬁxed, p ∈ X and
U := B(p, R) ∩ R. Using the notation bv ∈ (0,∞] from Deﬁnition 7.1, we deﬁne
for any 0 ≤ t1 < t2 ≤ ∞

Wt1,t2(U) := {v ∈ SU :

t1 < bv ≤ t2}.

We will now bound the measure of Wt1,t2(U). First note that, since the geo-
desic ﬂow is volume preserving as long as it exists, for any 0 < t ≤ t1 the map
Wt1,∞(R) → Wt1−t,∞(R), v 7→ γv(t) is volume preserving. Setting t = t1 yields

|Wt1,t2(U)| = |{γv(t1)

: v ∈ Wt1,t2(U)}|.

Since the function rRm : X → [0,∞) is 1-Lipschitz and limtրbv rRm(γv(t)) = 0 if
bv < ∞, we ﬁnd that

rRm(γv(t1)) ≤ t2 − t1

for all

v ∈ Wt1,t2(U).

So for some 1 < p < p0,

|Wt1,t2(U)| ≤ |B(p, R + t1) ∩ {0 < rRm ≤ t2 − t1}| ≤ CX ,p,p,R+t1(t2 − t1)p.

56

RICHARD H BAMLER

Here CX ,p,p,R+t1 < ∞ is a constant that may depend on X , p, p and on R + t1.
The constant CX ,p,p,R+t1 can be chosen to be monotone in R + t1. So for any
N ≥ 1 and 0 < t0 < ∞ we have
NXj=1

N(cid:17)p
|W(j−1)/N ·t0,j/N ·t0(U)| ≤ N · CX ,p,p,R+t0(cid:16) t0

|{v ∈ SU :

bv ≤ t0}| ≤

.

bv ≤ t0} has measure zero.
Letting N → ∞ yields that {v ∈ S(B(p, R) ∩ R)
bv ≤ t0} has measure zero and using
Letting R → ∞ yields that {v ∈ SR :
analogous arguments, we obtain that {v ∈ SR : av, bv ≤ t0} has measure zero.
The ﬁrst claim now follows from (7.1). The second claim is clear.

(cid:3)

:

Proposition 7.3 (cf [Col97, Lemma 1.14]). Let X be a singular space with mild
singularities of codimension p0 > 1 and let p ∈ X, l, r > 0. Then for any C 2
function f : B(p, r + l) ∩ R → R and any t ∈ [0, l] we have

f (γv(l)) − f (γv(0))

l

f (γv(l)) − f (γv(0))

ˆS ∗B(p,r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇f, vi −

Proof. This proposition follows similarly as [Col97, Lemma 1.14]. The singular-
ities of X don’t cause any issues due to Lemma 7.2. Inequality (7.2) is a direct
consequence of (7.3) for t = 0.

(cid:3)

We also obtain the following segment inequality.

Proposition 7.4 (segment inequality, cf [CC96, Theorem 2.11]). For any D < ∞
there is a C = C(D) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities and assume that Ric ≥ −(n−1)
on R. Then there is an open subset G∗ ⊂ R × R such that for any (x1, x2) ∈ G∗
there is a unique minimizing geodesic γx1,x2 : [0, d(x1, x2)] → X between x1, x2
and such that the following holds:

(a) (R × R) \ G∗ has measure zero.
(b) If (x1, x2) ∈ G∗, then (x2, x1) ∈ G∗.
(c) γx1,x2([0, d(x1, x2)]) ⊂ R for all (x1, x2) ∈ G∗.
(d) γx1,x2 varies continuously in x1, x2.
(e) Consider open and bounded subsets U1, U2 ⊂ X such that

sup

d(x1, x2) < D.

(x1,x2)∈U1×U2

(7.4)

For assertion (e) it suﬃces to check that

Proof. We apply the discussion of section 2 to the (possibly incomplete) Riemann-
ian manifold (R, g). In the following, we will work with the subset G∗ ⊂ R × R
from Deﬁnition 2.2. Then assertions (b)–(d) follow immediately. Assertion (a)
follows from Proposition 2.3(c), Fubini’s Theorem and the fact that R \ Gp ⊂ Qp
is a set of measure zero for all p ∈ R.
ˆ((U1∩R)×(U2∩R))∩G ∗ ˆ d(x1,x2)
for some C = C(D) < ∞, as reversing the roles of U1, U2 and x1, x2 and adding
both resulting inequalities yields (7.4). In order to show inequality (7.5) it suﬃces
to show that for any x1 ∈ U1 ∩ R we have

f (γx1,x2(s))dsdg(x1)dg(x2) ≤ C|U1∩R|ˆR

8. Almost splitting implies existence of a splitting map

In this section, we recall the deﬁnition of an ε-splitting map and generalize this

notion to singular spaces.
Deﬁnition 8.1 (ε-splitting, cf [CN15, Deﬁnition 1.20]). Let ε > 0, X a singular
space, p ∈ X and r > 0. A map u = (u1, . . . , uk) : B(p, r) → Rk is called an
ε-splitting if

(1) ul is harmonic for all l = 1, . . . , k (in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.4).
(2) For all x ∈ B(p, r) ∩ R we have
sup

|∇u|(x) :=

v∈TxR,|v|=1|(Du)(v)| ≤ 1 + ε.

(3) For all for all l1, l2 = 1, . . . , k we have

r−nˆB(p,r)∩R(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇ul1,∇ul2i − δl1l2(cid:12)(cid:12)2dg < ε2.

(4) For all l = 1, . . . , k we have

r−n+2ˆB(p,r)∩R |∇2ul|2dg < ε2.

The goal of this section is to prove the following proposition.

(8.1)

(8.2)

[Che01, Theorem 9.29],

Proposition 8.2 (cf [Col97, sec 2],
[CN15, Lemma
1.21(2)]). For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, p0, Y ) > 0
such that the following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0 and assume that X is Y -tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover
that Ric ≥ −δ2(n − 1)r−2 on R. Let p ∈ X be a point and k ∈ {1, . . . , n} and let
(Z, dZ, z) be a pointed metric space. Assume that

(8.3)
Then there is an ε-splitting map u : BX (x, r) → Rk. If k = n, then u can be
chosen such that additionally

((z, 0k), δ−1r), (z, 0k)(cid:1)(cid:1) < δr.

(cid:12)(cid:12)|u(x)| − d(x, p)(cid:12)(cid:12) < εr

for all

x ∈ BX(p, r).

(8.4)

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

59

As a preparation, we establish the following lemma.

Lemma 8.3. For any ε > 0 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, Y ) > 0 such that the
following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0 > 1 and assume that X is Y -tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume
moreover that Ric ≥ −δ2(n − 1)r−2 on R. Choose points p ∈ X and q−, q+ ∈ R
such that

d(p, q±) > δ−1r

and

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)d(x, q−) + d(x, q+)(cid:1) −(cid:0)d(p, q−) + d(p, q+)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) < δr

x ∈ B(p, r).
(8.5)
Then, for b±(x) := d(x, q±) and the associated signed measure dµ△b± (see Propo-
sition 2.5) we have

for all

rˆB(p,r)∩R

d|µ△b±| < εrn.

(8.6)

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1. Set b±(x) :=
d(x, q±) and set b0 := b−(p) + b+(p). Then by (8.5), we have

Moreover, using Laplace comparison (see Proposition 4.2), we have for small δ

|b+ + b− − b0| < δ

on

B(p, 1).

cosh(δb(·))
δ−1 sinh(δb(·))

dg ≤ 2(n − 1)δdg

dµ△b± ≤ (n − 1)
Now apply Proposition 5.3 to B(p, 2) to obtain the sequence si → 0 the subsets
Ui and the cutoﬀ functions φi : Ui → [0, 1]. Next recall that the function rRm :
X → [0,∞) is 1-Lipschitz. As in the proof of Lemma 5.1, we can ﬁnd a C 1
function f ∈ C 1(R) such that

B(p, 2) ∩ R.

(8.7)

on

1
2rRm < f < 2rRm

and

|∇f| < 2.

Let F : [0,∞) → [0, 1] be a smooth function such that F ≡ 0 on [0, 2] and F ≡ 1
on [4,∞). For every i = 1, 2, . . ., we deﬁne ηi ∈ C 2(R) by

ηi(x) := F (s−1

i f (x))

i

. It follows that ηiφi ∈ C 2

Then supp ηi ∩ B(p, 2) ⊂ {rRm > si} ∩ B(p, 2) ⊂ Ui, ηi ≡ 1 on {rRm > 8si} and
|∇ηi| < Cs−1
c (Ui) and ηiφi → 1 pointwise on B(p, 1)∩R
as i → ∞. So, by Proposition 2.5 we have

d(cid:12)(cid:12)µ△b− + µ△b+(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cδ.

Since ηiφi → 1 pointwise on B(p, 1) ∩ R, we obtain by Fatou’s Lemma that

The bound (8.6) now follows from the fact that

d|µ△b±| ≤ d|µ△b− + µ△b+| + d(µ△b+)+ + d(µ△b−)+

and (8.7) for suﬃciently small δ. Here the last two terms denote the positive
parts of the measures µ△b±.
(cid:3)

We can now derive a partial version of Proposition 8.2.

Lemma 8.4. For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, p0, Y ) > 0
such that the following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0 and assume that X is Y -tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover
that Ric ≥ −δ2(n − 1)r−2 on R. Let p ∈ X be a point, let k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, let
(Z, dZ, z) be a pointed metric space and assume that (8.3) holds. Then there is a
continuous map u = (u1, . . . , uk) : BX (p, r) → Rk such that the following holds:
(a) There is a map ζ : BX(p, r) → Z with d(ζ(p), z) < εr such that the map
(ζ, u1, . . . , uk) : BX(p, r) → Z × Rk is an εr-Gromov-Hausdorﬀ approxi-
mation between BX (p, r) and BZ×Rk((z, u(p)), r).

(b) ul is harmonic for each l = 1, . . . , k.
(c) For each l = 1, . . . , k, we have

r−nˆBX (p,r)∩R(cid:12)(cid:12)|∇ul|2 − 1| < ε2.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1. The constant δ > 0

we ﬁnd a harmonic u : BX(p, 10) → Rk such that for all l = 1, . . . , k

It remains to show assertion (a). For this, observe that by Corollary 6.3 there
is a uniform constant C < ∞ such that |∇ul| < C on B(p, 4) ∩ R. As (X, d) is
the metric completion of (R, g), this implies that ul is C-Lipschitz on B(p, 2) and
thus that ul − bl

2a(C + 1)−1). So, using (8.8),
for some y ∈ B(p, 1), then |ul − bl
this shows that

In order to obtain the L2-Hessian estimate (8.2), we will use the following

lemma.
Lemma 8.5. For any Y < ∞ there is a constant C = C(Y ) < ∞ such that the
following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with singularities of codimension p0 >
2 and assume that X is Y -tame at scale 2r for some r > 0. Assume moreover
that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)κr−2 on R for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1. Let p ∈ X be a point and
consider a harmonic function u : B(p, 2r) → R. Then

RICHARD H BAMLER

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1. By passing to
a slightly smaller ball, we may assume that |u|,|∇u| < C∗ on B(p, 2) ∩ R for
some C∗ < ∞. The derivative bound can be assumed since by Corollary 6.5, the
function u is locally Lipschitz. By local elliptic regularity and by passing to a yet
slightly smaller ball, we may also assume that |∇2u| < C∗r−1
Invoke Proposition 5.3 for the ball B(p, 2) and consider the sequence si → 0,
the subsets Ui ⊂ B(p, 2)∩R and the cutoﬀ functions φi : X → [0, 1]. Then, using
Bochner’s identity,
△(cid:0)|∇u|2 − a(cid:1) = 2|∇2u|2 + 2 Ric(∇u,∇u) ≥ 2|∇2u|2 − 2(n − 1)κ|∇u|2,
we obtain for any a ∈ R that for some uniform constant C = C(Y ) < ∞ and
some constant C∗∗ < ∞, which may depend on C∗ and a, but not on i, and some

This ﬁnishes the proof.

For the gradient estimate (8.1), we will use the following lemma.

Lemma 8.6. For any p0 > 2 and Y < ∞ there is a constant C = C(p0, Y ) < ∞
such that the following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with singularities of codimension p0
and assume that X is Y -tame at some scale r > 0. Assume moreover that
Ric ≥ −(n− 1)κr−2 on R for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1. Let p ∈ X be a point and consider
a harmonic function u : B(p, 2r) → R. Then for any a ≥ 0 and y ∈ B(p, r) ∩ R

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

+ Cr2−nˆB(p,2r)∩R |∇2u|2 + Cr−nˆB(p,2r)∩R(cid:12)(cid:12)|∇u|2 − a(cid:12)(cid:12).

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1 and, as in the proof
of Lemma 8.5, we may assume that |u|,|∇u| are uniformly bounded. Also ﬁx
some 2 < p < p0.
Let y ∈ B(p, 1) ∩ R and apply Proposition 5.3 to B(y, 1/2) to obtain the
sequence si → 0, the subsets Ui ⊂ B(y, 1/2) ∩ R and the cutoﬀ functions φi.
We can again deduce an estimate of the form |∇2u| < C∗r−1
Rm on B(p, 2) ∩ R
and a similar local gradient estimate for the heat kernel K(y,·, t) on ∂sUi for
large i. By Bochner’s identity (8.9), we have for some uniform generic constant
C = C(Y ) < ∞ and some generic constant C∗∗ < ∞, which may depend on X ,
p, p and C∗, that for large i

The claim now follows using the fact that K(y,·, 1) ≤ Y and letting i → ∞. (cid:3)
Lemma 8.7. For any p0 > 2 and Y < ∞ there is a constant C = C(p0, Y ) < ∞
such that the following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with singularities of codimension p0
and assume that X is Y -tame at some scale r > 0. Assume moreover that
Ric ≥ −(n− 1)κr−2 on R for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1. Let p ∈ X be a point and consider
a vector valued function u = (u1, . . . , uk) : B(p, 2r) → Rk whose component

functions u1, . . . , uk are harmonic. Then for any y ∈ B(p, r) ∩ R we have

≤

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 8.2. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1.
Apply Lemma 8.4 for r ← 16 to obtain u = (u1, . . . , uk) : B(p, 16) → Rk.
Replacing u by u − u(p), we may assume that u(p) = 0k. Using assertion (c) of
Lemma 8.4 and Lemma 8.5, we ﬁnd that

ˆB(p,8)∩R |∇2u|2 < Ψ(δ|Y ).

(8.11)

So for suﬃciently small δ, this implies item (4) of Deﬁnition 8.1 for the restriction
u|B(p,1). It remains to verify items (2) and (3). Next, we will show that for any
l1, l2 = 1, . . . , k, l1 6= l2

ˆB(p,4)∩R(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇ul1,∇ul2i(cid:12)(cid:12)2 < Ψ(δ|Y ).

(8.12)

This bound together with Lemma 8.4(c) will then imply item (3) of Deﬁnition 8.1
and, using Lemma 8.7, item (2). Thus we will ﬁnd that u|B(p,1) is an ε-splitting
map for suﬃciently small δ. The bound (8.4) will be veriﬁed at the end of the
proof.

66

RICHARD H BAMLER

We follow the lines of the proof of [Col97, Lemma 2.9] to show (8.12). Fix
l1, l2 ∈ {1, . . . , k}, l1 6= l2. Note ﬁrst that by Proposition 7.3, (8.11) and H¨older’s
inequality we have for i = 1, 2

ˆS ∗B(p,4)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇uli, vi −(cid:0)uli(γv(1)) − uli(γv(0))(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ|Y ).

Let θ > 0 be a parameter whose value we will determine later and set

C ∗
θ := {v ∈ S∗B(p, 4)

: ∠(v,∇ul1(γv(0))) < θ}.

Then also

Note that, by Lemma 8.6, Lemma 8.4(c) and (8.11), the two terms in the dif-
ference in this integrand are bounded by a constant that only depends on Y .
So

θ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇uli, vi −(cid:0)uli(γv(1)) − uli(γv(0))(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ|Y ).
ˆC ∗
θ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇uli, vi2 −(cid:0)uli(γv(1)) − uli(γv(0))(cid:1)2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ|Y ).
ˆC ∗

(8.13)

On the other hand, using the Pythagorean Theorem and Lemma 8.4(a), we have
for any y1, y2 ∈ B(p, 2) that
(cid:0)ul1(y1) − ul1(y2)(cid:1)2

+(cid:0)ul2(y1) − ul2(y2)(cid:1)2

< d2(y1, y2) + Ψ(δ|Y ).

It follows that

θ (cid:16)(cid:0)ul1(γv(1)) − ul1(γv(0))(cid:1)2
ˆC ∗

+(cid:0)ul2(γv(1)) − ul2(γv(0))(cid:1)2(cid:17) < |C ∗

θ| + Ψ(δ|Y ).

Combining this with (8.13) yields

θ (cid:0)h∇ul1, vi2 + h∇ul2, vi2(cid:1) < |C ∗
ˆC ∗
So we obtain, using h∇ul1, vi > |∇ul1| cos θ for v ∈ C ∗

θ| + Ψ(δ|Y ).

θ and Lemma 8.4(c) that

ˆC ∗

θ

h∇ul2, vi2 < Ψ(θ)|C ∗

θ| + Ψ(δ|Y ).

(8.14)

Set now

Cθ := {v ∈ SB(p, 4)

: ∠(v,∇ul1(γv(0))) < θ}.

By Lemma 7.2 the subset Cθ \ C ∗

θ has measure zero. So by (8.14) we have

ˆCθh∇ul2, vi2 < Ψ(θ)|Cθ| + Ψ(δ|Y ).

So if we choose ﬁrst θ and then δ suﬃciently small, we obtain (8.12).

Finally, we need to verify (8.4) in the case in which k = n and δ is suﬃciently
small. To see this, let x ∈ B(p, 1)∩R, set d := d(x, p) and assume that ε < 1. By
the segment inequality, Proposition 7.4, (8.11), (8.12) and Lemma 8.4(c), we can
ﬁnd points p′ ∈ B(p, ε/10) ∩ R and x′ ∈ B(x, ε/10) ∩ R such that the following

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

holds: The arclength minimizing geodesic γ := γp′,x′ : [0, a] → R between p′, q′ is
contained in R, for all l = 1, . . . , n

ˆ a
0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(ul ◦ γ)′′(s)(cid:12)(cid:12)ds ≤ ˆ a

and for all l1, l2 = 1, . . . , n

0 |∇2ul|(γ(s))ds < Ψ(δ|ε, Y )

Since a < 2, the bound (8.15) implies

(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇ul1(p′),∇ul2(p′)i − δl1l2(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ|ε, Y ).
(cid:12)(cid:12)ul(x′) − ul(p′) − ah∇ul(p′), γ′(0)i(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ|ε, Y ).

(8.15)

(8.16)

So by (8.16) we have

Now note that

(cid:12)(cid:12)|u(x′) − u(p′)|2 − a2(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ|ε, Y ).
|a − d| = |d(x′, p′) − d(x, p)| < ε/5.
(cid:12)(cid:12)|u(x)| − d(cid:12)(cid:12) < 3ε/5 + Ψ(δ|ε, Y ).

and, |u(p′)| ≤ (1+ε)d(p, p′) < ε/5, as well as |u(x′)−u(x)| ≤ (1+ε)d(x, x′) < ε/5.
So, we obtain that

This implies (8.4) for small δ.

(cid:3)

9. Volume Stability

In this section we prove the ﬁrst main property of singular spaces, Theorem 1.3,
which states that Gromov-Hausdorﬀ closeness to a Cartesian product of a metric
space with Rn implies closeness of the volume to the volume of Euclidean space.
Our proof follows the lines of [Col97, sec 2].

We ﬁrst need the following lemma.

Lemma 9.1. For any Y < ∞ there is an ε0 = ε0(Y ) > 0 such that the following
holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 > 1 that is
Y -tame at some scale r > 0 and let p ∈ X be a point. If u : B(p, r) → Rn is an
ε0-splitting map and y ∈ Rn such that |u(p) − y| ≥ r, then

u(B(p, r)) ∩ B(y,|y|) 6= ∅.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1 and u(p) = 0n.
Then, assuming ε0 to be small enough depending on Y , we need to ﬁnd some
z ∈ B(p, r) such that 2hu(z), yi > |u(z)|2. Using Proposition 7.3, we have

ˆS ∗B(p,1/2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇ul, vi − 2(cid:0)ul(γv(1/2)) − ul(γv(0)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(ε0|Y )

for all l = 1, . . . , n and

ˆB(p,1)(cid:12)(cid:12)h∇ul1,∇ul2i − δl1l2(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(ε0)

68

RICHARD H BAMLER

for all l1, l2 = 1, . . . , n. Note that by Y -tameness, we have |B(p, r′)∩R| > Y −1r′n
for all 0 < r′ < 1. So there is a point x ∈ B(p, 1/10) ∩ R and vector v ∈ TxR
such that SxR \ S∗R is a set of measure zero (here SxR denotes the ﬁber of SR
over x), such that at x we have

So for suﬃciently small ε0, we can ﬁnd some v ∈ SxR such that

l = 1, . . . , n.

Note that x = γv(0). Combining (9.1) and (9.2) yields

nXl=1 (cid:0)ul(γv(1/2)) − ul(x)(cid:1)yl > −Ψ(ε0|Y )|y| +

nXl=1

h∇ul, viyl > (1 − Ψ(ε0|Y ))|y|.

Setting z := γv(1/2) we then obtain for small ε0 (recall that u(p) = 0n)
hu(z), yi > (1 − Ψ(ε0|Y ))|y| − |u(x)| · |y|

≥ (1 − Ψ(ε0|Y ))|y| − (1 + ε0)d(x, p)|y| > 0.8|y| ≥ 0.8.

On the other hand, for small ε0
|u(z)| = |u(z) − u(p)| ≤ (1 + ε0)d(z, p) ≤ (1 + ε0)(d(z, x) + d(x, p))

< (1 + ε0)(0.5 + 0.1) < 0.7.

This shows that 2hu(z), yi > |u(z)|2 for suﬃciently small ε0.
Lemma 9.2. For every ε > 0 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, Y ) > 0 such that
the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 > 1 that is
Y -tame at some scale r > 0. Assume that Ric ≥ −(n − 1) on R. Let p ∈ X be a
point and consider a δ-splitting map u : B(p, r) → Rn that satisﬁes

(cid:3)

for all

x ∈ B(p, r).

(9.3)

Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)|u(x)| − d(p, x)| < δr

|B(p, r) ∩ R| > (ωn − ε)rn.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may again assume that r = 1.

We will ﬁrst show that for suﬃciently small δ we have |u(B(p, 1))| > ωn − ε/2.

Choose and ﬁx ν > 0 small enough such that

|B(0n, 1) \ B(0n, 1 − 3ν)| < ε/4.

(9.4)

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

69

Using (9.3) we may assume that δ is chosen small enough such that

u(cid:0)B(p, 1) \ B(p, 1 − ν)(cid:1) ∩ B(0n, 1 − 2ν) = ∅.

So

A := B(0n, 1 − 3ν) \ u(B(p, 1)) = B(0n, 1 − 3ν) \ u(cid:0)B(p, 1 − ν)(cid:1)

is an open subset of Rn. If A = ∅, then |u(B(p, 1))| ≥ |B(0n, 1 − 3ν)| > ωn − ε/4
and we are done. So assume that A 6= ∅.
For any y ∈ A choose ry > 0 maximal with the property that B(y, ry) ∩
u(B(p, 1)) = ∅. Note that ry depends continuously on y and due to (9.3) we have
inf y∈A ry = 0. So if ry > ν for some y ∈ A, then we can ﬁnd some y0 ∈ A such
that r0 := ry0 = ν.
Assume for a moment that ry ≤ ν for all y ∈ A. By Vitali’s Covering Lemma
we can choose (ﬁnitely or countably inﬁnitely many) points y1, y2, . . . ∈ A and
radii r1 := ry1, r2 := ry2, . . . > 0 such that

B(yi, ri) ∩ u(B(p, 1)) = ∅,

∂B(yi, ri) ∩ u(B(p, 1)) 6= ∅,

such that the balls B(yi, 3ri) are pairwise disjoint and such that

[i

B(yi, 15ri) ⊃ A.

It follows, using Proposition 4.1, that

Xi>0

(9.5)

By the deﬁnition of the radii ri, we can choose a point xi ∈ B(p, 1) such that
|u(xi)− yi| = ri. This can be done both in the cases in which ry ≤ ν for all y ∈ A
and in which we have picked the points y1, y2, . . ., as well as in the case in which
ry > ν for some y ∈ A and in which we have picked the point y0 with ry0 = ν.
Note that in both cases |u(xi)| ≤ |yi| + ri < 1 − 3ν + ν = 1 − 2ν. This implies
that xi ∈ B(p, 1 − ν) and hence that B(xi, ri) ⊂ B(p, 1). By Lemma 9.1, the
restriction u|B(xi,ri) : B(xi, ri) → Rn cannot be an ε0-splitting map. So we have

Consider ﬁrst the case i = 0 and r0 = ν. Since u is a δ-splitting, we then have

assume in the following consider the case i = 1, 2, . . ..
We now claim that the balls B(xi, ri) are pairwise disjoint. Assume that two
such balls, for two indices i, i′, intersect. Then, for suﬃciently small δ, we have

|yi − yi′| ≤ |yi − u(xi)| + |u(xi) − u(xi′)| + |u(xi′) − yi′|

≤ ri + (1 + δ)d(xi, xi′) + ri′ < ri + (1 + δ)(ri + ri′) + ri′ < 3ri + 3ri′,

in contradiction to the fact that all B(yi, 3ri) are pairwise disjoint. Using the fact
that u is an δ-splitting map and (9.6), it follows that

Combining this with (9.5) yields that for suﬃciently small δ

Using (9.4), it follows that

|A| < ε/4.

|u(B(p, 1))| > ωn − ε/2.

Next, we show that |u(B(p, 1))| = |u(B(p, 1) ∩ R)|. Let 0 < s < 1 and choose
a minimal s-net y1, . . . , yN of {rRm < s} ∩ B(p, 1). Then the balls B(yi, s) cover
{rRm < s} ∩ B(p, 1) and the balls B(yi, s/2) are pairwise disjoint. Since rRm
is 1-Lipschitz, we have B(yi, s/2) ⊂ {rRm < 2s} ∩ B(p, 2). So for some generic
constant C∗ < ∞, which may depend on X and p but not on s, we have

N < C∗(s/2)−n|{rRm < 2s} ∩ B(p, 2) ∩ R|.

It follows that

|u(B(p, 1) \ R)| ≤ |u({rRm < s} ∩ B(p, 1))|

≤(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

N[i=1

B(u(zi), (1 + δ)s)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C∗Nsn ≤ C∗|{rRm < 2s} ∩ B(p, 2) ∩ R|.

Letting s → 0 yields |u(B(p, 1) \ R)| = 0 and hence

|u(B(p, 1) ∩ R)| = |u(B(p, 1))| > ωn − ε/2.

Since u is a δ-splitting, we ﬁnd a constant C < ∞ such that the Jacobian

|det du| of u satisﬁes the following estimate

ˆB(p,1)∩R(cid:12)(cid:12)|det du| − 1(cid:12)(cid:12) < Cδ.

So

ωn − ε/2 < |u(B(p, 1) ∩ R)| = ˆB(p,1)∩R |det du| ≤ (1 + Cδ)|B(p, 1) ∩ R|.

The claim now follows for suﬃciently small δ.

We can ﬁnally prove Theorem 1.3.

10. Cone rigidity

The goal of this section is to reprove the Cone Rigidity Theorem of Cheeger
and Colding (see [CC96]) for singular spaces. More speciﬁcally, we will show
Theorem 1.5 from subsection 1.3.

We ﬁrst establish the existence of a function b on an annulus around p that
approximates d2(p,·) in W 1,2 and for which |∇2b − 2g| is small in an L2-sense.
Lemma 10.1 (cf [CC96, Corollary 4.83]). For any ε, η > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞
there is a δ = δ(ε, η, p0, Y ) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -
tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥ −(n− 1)κ on R
for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ δr−2. Let p ∈ X be a point and set f := d2(·, p). Assume that

|B(p, εr/4) ∩ R|

v−κ(εr/4)

− |B(p, 8r) ∩ R|

v−κ(8r)

< δ.

Then there is a locally Lipschitz function b : A(p, εr, r) → R such that b is C 3 on
A(p, εr, r) ∩ R and such that the following holds

|B(p, ε/4) ∩ R|

v−κ(ε/4)

− |A(p, 4, 8) ∩ R|
v−κ(8) − v−κ(4)
v−κ(8) − v−κ(4)(cid:18)|B(p, ε/4) ∩ R|

v−κ(ε/4)

v−κ(8)

− |B(p, 8) ∩ R|

v−κ(8)

(cid:19) < Cδ.

By the third tameness property applied to the annulus A(p, ε/4, 4) and Corol-
lary 6.5, we can ﬁnd a harmonic function h : A(p, ε/4, 4) → R that satisﬁes
(10.1a)

42−n ≤ h ≤ (ε/4)2−n,

ˆA(p,ε/4,4)∩R |∇(h − d2−n(p,·))|2dg < Cδ,

(10.1b)

on

A(p, εr, r),

|b − f| < ηr2
ˆA(p,εr,r)∩R |∇(b − f )|2dg < ηrn+2,
ˆA(p,εr,r)∩R(cid:12)(cid:12)∇2b − 2g(cid:12)(cid:12)2

dg < ηrn.

Proof. We follow the lines of the proof of [CC96, Proposition 4.81]. Without loss
of generality, we may assume that r = 1.

Let us ﬁrst deduce the following bound, using Proposition 4.1:
|A(p, 4, 8) ∩ R|
v−κ(8) − v−κ(4)

= |B(p, 8) ∩ R|
v−κ(8) − v−κ(4) − |B(p, 4) ∩ R|
v−κ(8) − v−κ(4)

v−κ(8) − v−κ(4) − |B(p, ε/4) ∩ R|
≥ |B(p, 8) ∩ R|
v−κ(8) − v−κ(4) ·
So, for some constant C < ∞, which only depends on the dimension,

v−κ(4)
v−κ(ε/4)

.

(10.1c)

Here, and in the rest of the proof, C < ∞ is a generic constant that only depends
on ε, p0 and Y . By Corollary 6.5, we know that h is harmonic and locally
Lipschitz. Moreover, by Corollary 6.3 we have

|∇h| < C

suﬃciently small δ.
(cid:3)

Next, we show that almost every minimizing geodesic in an annulus around p
encloses an angle with the vector ﬁeld ∇d(·, p) that can be estimated using the
law of cosines.
Lemma 10.2 (cf [CC96, Corollary 2.48]). For any 0 < ε < 1, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞
there is a 0 < δ = δ(ε, p0, Y ) < ε such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -
tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)κ on
R for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ δr−2. Let p ∈ R and assume that
− |B(p, 16r) ∩ R|

|B(p, δr) ∩ R|

v−κ(16r)

Let x ∈ A(p, εr, r). Then there is a point x′ ∈ B(x, εr) ∩ R and an open subset
S ⊂ A(p, εr, r) ∩ R such that the following holds:

(a) |(A(p, εr, r) ∩ R) \ S| < εrn.
(b) d(·, p) and d(·, x′) are C 1 on S.
(c) For any y ∈ S there is a unique minimizing arclength geodesic γx′,y :
[0, d(x′, y)] → X with γx′,y([0, d(x′, y)]) ⊂ R, γx′,y varies continuously in
y, and we have

2d(y, p)d(x′, y)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε. (10.11)

Proof. We argue similarly as in the proof of [CC96, Corollary 2.48]. Without loss
of generality, we may assume that r = 1.

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

75

We ﬁrst argue that for a suﬃciently small choice of 0 < ρ < ε2/10 (depending
on ε) the following is true: If x′ ∈ B(x, ρ), y ∈ A(p, ε, 1), ∇d(·, p) is C 1 at y and
γ : [0, d(x, y)] → X is a minimizing arclength geodesic between x′, y that leaves
the annulus A(p, ρ, 4), then

d2(x′, p) − d2(y, p) − d2(x′, y)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

+ 1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε/4.

(10.12)

In fact, if ρ < ε/2, then x′ ∈ A(p, ε/2, 2). If γ leaves A(p, ρ, 4), then there is some
s ∈ [0, d(x, y)] such that d(p, γ(s)) ≤ ρ. It follows that

d(y, x′) ≤ d(y, p) + d(p, x′) ≤ d(y, γ(s)) + ρ + d(γ(s), x′) + ρ = d(y, x′) + 2ρ.
So for suﬃciently small ρ, we can ensure (10.12). We will ﬁx ρ from now on.

Let ν > 0 be a constant whose value we will determine at the end of the
proof, depending on ε, Y, ρ. Assuming δ to be suﬃciently small (depending on
ν, ρ, ε, p0, Y ), we apply Lemma 10.1 with r ← 4, ε ← ρ/2 and η ← ν to obtain
the function b : A := A(p, ρ/2, 4) → R. Note that then

|b − d2(·, p)| < ν

(10.13a)
We now apply Proposition 7.4 with U1 ← B(x, ρ), U2 ← A = A(p, ε, 1), f ←
|∇2b − 2g|χA. Doing this, and assuming ν and hence δ to be suﬃciently small
(depending on ε, Y, ρ), we can ﬁnd a point x′ ∈ B(x, ρ) ∩ R and and open subset
S ⊂ A(p, ε, 1) ∩ R in such a way that assertions (a) and (b) hold and such that
additionally the following is true:

A(p, ρ, 4).

(cid:12)(cid:12)∇b − ∇d2(·, p)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(ν|ε, η, Y )

(10.13b)
and for any y ∈ S there is a unique minimizing arclength geodesic γx′,y : [0,

We will now show that (10.13a)–(10.13c) imply (10.11). So ﬁx y for the rest of

d2(x′, p) − d2(y, p) − d2(x′, y)

(10.17)

Next, we verify (10.17) in the case in which γ([0, d]) 6⊂ A. Choose s ∈ [0, d] such
that γ((s, d]) ⊂ A and d(p, γ(s)) = ρ. Then (10.15) holds for all s1, s2 ∈ (s, d]
and instead of (10.16) we get

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)(b ◦ γ)(d) − d2(cid:1) −(cid:0)(b ◦ γ)(s) − s2(cid:1)

which implies

−(cid:0)(b ◦ γ)′(d) − 2d(cid:1) · (d − s)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(ν|ε, ρ, Y ),

Using (10.13a) we ﬁnd

(cid:12)(cid:12)b(y) − b(γ(s)) + (d − s)2 − (b ◦ γ)′(d) · (d − s)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(ν|ε, ρ, Y ).
(cid:12)(cid:12)d2(y, p) − ρ2 + (d − s)2 − (b ◦ γ)′(d) · (d − s)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(ν|ε, ρ, Y ).
(cid:12)(cid:12)2d(y, p) · (d − s) − (b ◦ γ)′(d) · (d − s)(cid:12)(cid:12) < 2ρ2 + Ψ(ν|ε, ρ, Y ).

So by d2(y, p) + (d − s)2 − 2d(y, p) · (d − s) = (d(y, p) − (d − s))2 ≤ ρ2, we get

Since d − s > ε − ρ > ε > ρ1/2 and d(y, p) > ε > ρ1/2, we get

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(b ◦ γ)′(d)

2d(y, p) − 1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ρ + Ψ(ν|ε, ρ, Y ).

Combining this inequality with (10.12) we ﬁnd that (10.17) also holds for small
ν in the case in which γ([0, d]) 6⊂ A.
Lastly, observe that by (10.13b)
(b ◦ γ)′(d)

(cid:3)

So (10.11) follows from (10.17) for suﬃciently small ν.

Next, we integrate the approximate law of cosines identity from Lemma 10.2

to obtain an approximation of an identity that is true on metric cones.
Lemma 10.3. For any 0 < ε < 1, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a 0 < δ =
δ(ε, p0, Y ) < ε such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -
tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)κ on
R for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ δr−2. Let p ∈ R and assume that

(10.18)

Proof. Assume without loss of generality that r = 1. Let ζ > 0 be a constant
whose value will be determined and ﬁxed at the end of this paragraph and consider
ﬁrst the case in which x almost lies on the minimizing segment between z1, z2, in
the sense that

Then, using the triangle inequality,

d(x, z1) + d(x, z2) < d(z1, z2) + ζ.

(10.19)

0 ≥ d(x, p) − d(z1, p) − d(x, z1) = d(x, p) − d(z2, p) + d(z1, z2) − d(x, z1)

> d(x, p) − d(z2, p) + d(x, z2) − ζ ≥ −ζ.

and

0 ≥ d(z2, p) − d(x, z2) − d(x, p) ≥ d(z2, p) − d(x, z2) − d(x, z1) − d(z1, p)

> d(z2, p) − d(z1, z2) − ζ − d(z1, p) = −ζ.

So for i = 1, 2

d2(x, zi) − d2(x, p) − d2(zi, p)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

+ 2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(ζ|ε).

So for suﬃciently small ζ the bound (10.19) implies the bound (10.18). For the
remainder of the proof we ﬁx ζ to be so small and we consider from now on the
case

d(x, z1) + d(x, z2) ≥ d(z1, z2) + ζ.

(10.20)

Let 0 < ν < ε/10, µ > 0 be constants whose values will be determined in the
course of the proof, depending on ε, Y . Apply Lemma 10.2 for r ← 2, ε ← ν to
obtain the point x′ ∈ B(x, ν) ∩ R and the open subset S ⊂ A(p, ε/2, 2) ∩ R.
For a given µ > 0 apply Proposition 7.4 to Ui ← B(zi, µ) and f being the
characteristic function of (A(p, ε/2, 2) ∩ R) \ S. If 0 < ν < µ/10 is suﬃciently
small (depending on µ, ε, Y ), then we can ﬁnd points

Next we show that balls around p are almost star-shaped.

Lemma 10.5. For any ε, η, a > 0 there is a δ = δ(ε, η, a) > 0 such that the
following holds:

Let X be a singular space with mild singularities, r > 0 and p ∈ R and assume

that for some 0 ≤ κ ≤ r−2 we have Ric ≥ −(n − 1)κ on R and that

|B(p, εr/4) ∩ R|

v−κ(εr/4)

− |B(p, 4r) ∩ R|

v−κ(4r)

< δ.

Assume moreover, that X is a-noncollapsed at scale r in the sense that for any
0 < r′ < r and x ∈ X we have

|B(x, r′) ∩ R| > ar′n.

Then for any x ∈ A(p, εr, r) there is an arclength minimizing geodesic γ : [0, r] →
R with γ(0) = p and a parameter s ∈ [0, r] such that d(x, γ(s)) ≤ ηr.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1, ε = 2−k < 1/10
and η < ε/10. We will determine δ at the end of the proof.

Assume that the conclusion was wrong for some x ∈ A(p, ε, 1). Consider an
arbitrary point y ∈ (A(p, 2, 4) ∩ R) \ Qp and let γ∗ : [0, l] → R be an arclength
minimizing geodesic between p and y. Then by assumption

γ∗([0, l]) ∩ B(x, η) ⊂ γ∗([0, 2]) ∩ B(x, η) = ∅.

So, by looking at the proof of Proposition 4.1, and taking into account that these
geodesic segments γ∗ between p and points in A(p, 2, 4) avoid B(x, η), we ﬁnd
that for any j = 0, 1, 2, . . .

v−κ(2−j+1) − v−κ(2−j)

v−κ(4) − v−κ(2)

|A(p, 2, 4) ∩ R| ≤ |(A(p, 2−j, 2−j+1) \ B(x, η)) ∩ R|.

Summing this inequality over all j = 0, . . . , k + 2 yields

v−κ(2) − v−κ(ε/4)
v−κ(4) − v−κ(2) |A(p, 2, 4) ∩ R| ≤ |A(p, ε/4, 2) ∩ R| − |B(x, η) ∩ R|.

So we obtain a contradiction for suﬃciently small δ, depending on ε, η, a.

(cid:3)

We can ﬁnally prove the Cone Rigidity Theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.5. It suﬃces to prove the following fact: Fix Y < ∞, p0 > 3
and consider a sequence δi → 0, a sequence of singular spaces Xi with mild
singularities of codimension p0 that are Y -tame at scale δ−1
that satisfy Ric ≥
−(n − 1)κi on R for some 0 ≤ κi ≤ δ2

− |B(pi, 32) ∩ Ri|

Then, after passing to a subsequence, the pointed metric spaces (BXi(pi, 1), pi)
Gromov-Hausdorﬀ converge to a 1-ball (BC(p, 1), p) around the vertex p ∈ C of a
metric cone C.
First, observe that we may assume without loss of generality that pi ∈ Ri.
Next, note that in this setting, for any i and any δi ≤ r1 ≤ r2 ≤ 32 we have

|B(pi, r1) ∩ Ri|

v−κi(r1)

− |B(pi, r2) ∩ Ri|

v−κi(r2)

< δi.

After passing to a subsequence, we may assume that the pointed metric spaces
(BXi(pi, 1), pi) converge to some locally compact, pointed metric length space
(Z, dZ, z0). Using Lemma 10.5, we obtain that for any z ∈ Z and η > 0 there is
a point z′ ∈ Z such that d(z0, z′) > 1 − η and d(z0, z) + d(z, z′) < d(z0, z′) + η.
By local compactness and letting η → 0 we can then conclude that there is even

82

a point z′′ ∈ Z with d(z0, z′′) = 1 and d(z0, z) + d(z, z′) = d(z0, z′). It follows
that for any z ∈ Z there is an arclength minimizing geodesic γ : [0, 1] → Z with
γ(0) = z0 such that z = γ(s) for some s ∈ [0, 1].
Let W be the set of all arclength minimizing geodesics γ : [0, 1] → Z with
γ(0) = z0. By our previous conclusion, image of the map Φ : W × [0, 1] →
Z, (γ, s) 7→ γ(s) contains B(z0, 1). For any γ1, γ2 ∈ W , we deﬁne the angle

according to the law of cosines. Then, by Lemma 10.4, for any γ1, γ2 ∈ W and
s1, s2 ∈ [0, 1]
(10.26)
Using this identity, it can be seen that α is a pseudometric on W . Let W ′ be the
metric space obtained from (W, α) by quotienting out the relation d(γ1, γ2) = 0
and deﬁne (C, p) to be the cone over W ′. By (10.26), the pointed metric space
(Z, z0) is isometric to (BC(p, 1), p). This ﬁnishes the proof.

11. Splitting maps induce almost metric splitting

The goal of this section is to prove the following result:

Proposition 11.1. For every ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a δ =
δ(ε, p0, Y ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -
tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 on
R. Let p ∈ X and k ≤ n and consider a δ-splitting map u : B(p, 100r) → Rk.
Then there is a pointed metric space (Z, dZ, z) such that

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BX (p, r), p(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rk

((z, 0k), r), (z, 0k)(cid:1)(cid:1) < δr.

The proof of this proposition is similar to the proof of the cone splitting the-
orem, Theorem 1.5. As a preparation we ﬁrst prove a lemma that is similar to
Lemma 10.2.
Lemma 11.2. For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, p0, Y ) > 0
such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -
tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 on
R. Let p ∈ X and k ≤ n and consider a δ-splitting map u : B(p, 3r) → Rk.
Let x ∈ B(p, r). Then there is a point x′ ∈ B(x, εr) and an open subset
S ⊂ B(p, r) ∩ R such that the following holds:

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 10.2. Instead of applying Proposi-
tion 7.4 to |∇2b − 2g|, we now need to apply this proposition to |∇2u1| + . . . +
|∇2uk|. Then (10.14) becomes

Consequently, (10.16) becomes
|(ul ◦ γ)(0) + (ul ◦ γ)′(d) · d − (ul ◦ γ)(d)| < Ψ(ν|Y ) · d2
The bound (11.1) can be derived from this inequality.

Next, we prove a lemma that is similar to Lemma 10.3.

Lemma 11.3. For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, p0, Y ) > 0
such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -
tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 on
R. Let p ∈ X and k ≤ n and consider a δ-splitting map u : B(p, 9r) → Rk.

Let x, z1, z2 ∈ B(p, r) such that

(11.2)

(cid:12)(cid:12)d(z1, z2) − |u(z1) − u(z2)|(cid:12)(cid:12) < δr.

Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)d2(z1, x) − |u(z1) − u(x)|2(cid:1) −(cid:0)d2(z2, x) − |u(z2) − u(x)|2(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) < εr2.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1. Next, consider the
function

Moreover

|u(z1) − u(x)|2 − |u(z2) − u(x)|2 =(cid:10)u(z1) − u(z2), u(z1) + u(z2) − 2u(x)(cid:11)

=(cid:0)u∗(z1) − u∗(z2)(cid:1) ·(cid:0)u∗(z1) + u∗(z2) − 2u∗(x)(cid:1)

=(cid:0)u∗(z1) − u∗(x)(cid:1)2 −(cid:0)u∗(z2) − u∗(x)(cid:1)2.
This shows that in the following we may assume without loss of generality that
k = 1. Moreover, we may assume without loss of generality that u(z1) ≤ u(z2).
We now follow closely the arguments in the proof of Lemma 10.3, replacing
d(·, p) by u. Let 0 < ν < µ < ε be constants whose values we will determine in
the course of the proof, depending on ε, Y . Apply Lemma 11.2 for r ← 3r and
ε ← ν/3 to obtain a point x′ ∈ B(x, ν) ∩ R and the open subset S ⊂ B(p, 3r).
As in the proof of Lemma 10.3, assuming ν to be suﬃciently small depending on
µ, we can ﬁnd points

σ(0) = z′

1, σ(l) = z′

2, σ([0, l]) ⊂ R and such that
|[0, l] \ σ−1(S)| < µ.

(11.3)

As in the proof of Lemma 10.3, we deﬁne the function ℓ : [0, l] → R by

ℓ(s) := d(x′, σ(s)).

Then ℓ is 1-Lipschitz on [0, l], C 1 on σ−1(S) and we have for any s ∈ σ−1(S)
ℓ′(s) =(cid:10)γ′
x′,σ(s)(d(x′, σ(s))), σ′(s) − ∇u(cid:11).
So, using Lemma 11.2, it follows that for all s ∈ σ−1(S)

x′,σ(s)(d(x′, σ(s))), σ′(s)(cid:11)
=(cid:10)γ′
x′,σ(s)(d(x′, σ(s))),∇u(cid:11) +(cid:10)γ′

u(σ(s)) − u(x′)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < µ + |σ′(s) − ∇u(σ(s))|.

We can estimate that for small δ, depending on µ, we have for all s ∈ [0, l]
u(σ(s)) − u(z1) − d(z′
and, using (11.2),

1, σ(s)) ≤ (1 + δ)d(σ(s), z1) − d(z′
1, σ(s)) =(cid:0)u(σ(s))− u(z2)(cid:1) +(cid:0)u(z2)− u(z1)(cid:1)− d(z′

u(σ(s))− u(z1)− d(z′

ℓ(s)

So for all s ∈ [0, l]

2) − d(z′
(cid:12)(cid:12)u(σ(s)) − u(z1) − s(cid:12)(cid:12) < 4µ.

Combining this with (11.4) shows that for all s ∈ σ−1(S)

Next, using (11.2) we ﬁnd for suﬃciently small δ, depending on µ, that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)ℓ2(s)(cid:1)′ − 2u(z1) − 2s + 2u(x′)(cid:12)(cid:12) < 10µ + |σ′(s) − ∇u(σ(s))|.

(11.6)

≤ 4µ + 4δ + |u(z1) − u(z2)| − |u(z′

1) − u(z′

(11.5)

The bounds (11.3), (11.5), (11.6) and the fact that ℓ(s) is 1-Lipschitz then implies
as in the proof of Lemma 10.3 that

(cid:12)(cid:12)ℓ2(l) − ℓ2(0) − 2lu(z1) + 2lu(x′) − l2(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(µ).

It follows that

(cid:12)(cid:12)d2(z2, x) − d2(z1, x) − 2d(z1, z2)u(z1) + 2d(z1, z2)u(x) − d2(z1, z2)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(µ).

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

85

Using (11.2), we ﬁnd

(cid:12)(cid:12)d2(z2, x) − d2(z1, x) − 2(cid:0)u(z2) − u(z1)(cid:1)u(z1)
+ 2(cid:0)u(z2) − u(z1)(cid:1)u(x) −(cid:0)u(z1) − u(z2)(cid:1)2(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ, µ).
(cid:12)(cid:12)d2(z2, x) − d2(z1, x) +(cid:0)u(z1) − u(x)(cid:1)2 −(cid:0)u(z2) − u(x)(cid:1)2(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ, µ).

Hence the claim follows for suﬃciently small µ and δ.

So

(cid:3)

Applying Lemma 11.3 twice yields

Lemma 11.4. For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, p0, Y ) > 0
such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 that is Y -
tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0. Assume moreover that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 on
R. Let p ∈ X and k ≤ n and consider a δ-splitting map u : B(p, 9r) → Rk.

Let x1, x2, y1, y2 ∈ B(p, r) such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)d(x1, x2) − |u(x1) − u(x2)|(cid:12)(cid:12) < δr,
(cid:12)(cid:12)d(y1, y2) − |u(y1) − u(y2)|(cid:12)(cid:12) < δr.

Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)d2(x1, y1) − |u(x1) − u(y1)|2(cid:1) −(cid:0)d2(x2, y2) − |u(x2) − u(y2)|2(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) < εr2.

We also need

Lemma 11.5. For any ε > 0 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, Y ) > 0 such that
the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0 > 1 that
is Y -tame at some scale r > 0. Let p ∈ X and k ∈ {1, . . . , n} and consider a
δ-splitting map u : B(p, 3r) → Rk. Let x ∈ B(p, r) and choose w ∈ Rk such that
|w − u(x)| < r. Then we can ﬁnd a point y ∈ B(p, 3r) such that

and

(cid:12)(cid:12)d(x, y) − |u(x) − u(y)|(cid:12)(cid:12) < εr

|u(y) − w| < εr.

(11.7)

(11.8)

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 9.1. Without loss of generality,
we may assume again that r = 1. Let 0 < µ < 1/10 be a constant whose
value will be determined in the course of the proof, depending on ε and Y . Set
w′ := w − u(x) ∈ Rk and apply Proposition 7.3 with l := |w′| < 1 and f = ui.
Then

So we can ﬁnd a point x′ ∈ B(x, µ) ∩ R such that S∗

For small δ > 0 it is then possible to ﬁnd some vector v ∈ S∗

x′R such that

and

Set y := γv(l). Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)(w′)i − |w′| · h∇ui, vi(cid:12)(cid:12) < µ

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)|w′| · h∇ui, vi −(cid:0)ui(γv(l)) − ui(x′)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < Ψ(δ|Y ).

As |u(x′) − u(x)| ≤ (1 + δ)d(x′, x) < 2µ for small δ, we obtain (11.8) for small
enough µ. To see (11.7) observe that

|u(x) − u(y)| ≤ (1 + δ)d(x, y) ≤ d(x, y) + 2δ

and
|u(x) − u(y)| ≥ |w − u(x)| − |u(y) − w| ≥ |w′| − Ψ(µ, δ|Y )

= d(y, x′) − Ψ(µ, δ|Y ) ≥ d(x, y) − Ψ(µ, δ|Y ).

This ﬁnishes the proof for small µ and small δ.

(cid:3)

With Lemmas 11.4 and 11.5 in hand, we can ﬁnally prove Proposition 11.1.

Proof of Proposition 11.1. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1.
It suﬃces to show the following claim: Let Y < ∞, p0 > 3 and k ∈ {1, . . . , n} be
ﬁxed numbers and consider a sequence of positive numbers δi → 0 and a sequence
of singular spaces with mild singularities of codimension p0 that are Y -tame at
scale δ−1
and on whose regular part we have Ric ≥ −(n−1). Let moreover pi ∈ Xi
be points and consider δi-splitting maps ui : BXi(pi, 100) → Rk. Then, after
passing to a subsequence, the pointed metric spaces (Xi, dXi, pi) Gromov-Hausdorﬀ
converge to a pointed metric space (X∞, dX∞, p∞) such that there is a pointed
metric space (Z, dZ, z) with the property that (BX∞(p∞, 1), p∞) is isometric to
(BZ×Rk((z, 0k), 1), (z, 0k)).

i

Let us now prove this claim. After passing to a subsequence, we may assume
that the (Xi, dXi, pi) already Gromov-Hausdorﬀ converge to some pointed, locally
compact, metric length space (X∞, dX∞, p∞). After passing to a subsequence
once again, and after replacing ui by ui − ui(pi), we may also assume that the ui
uniformly converge to some u∞ : X∞ → Rk. By the deﬁnition of a splitting map,
u∞|BX∞ (p∞,50) must be 1-Lipschitz.
We will now analyze the geometry of BX∞(p∞, 1) and the function u∞ further.
Using Lemma 11.5, we obtain the following fact: For any y ∈ BX∞(p∞, 2) and
v ∈ Rk with |v| < 1 there is a y′ ∈ X∞ such that u∞(y′) = v and dX∞(y, y′) =
|u∞(y)−u∞(y′)|. On the other hand, if y, y′, y′′ ∈ BX∞(p∞, 10) such that u∞(y′) =
u∞(y′′) and

then Lemma 11.4 implies that y′ = y′′. So we can deﬁne the map
(0k, 1) → X∞

dX∞(y, y′) = dX∞(y, y′′) = |u∞(y) − u∞(y′)|,
Φ :(cid:0){u∞ = 0k} ∩ BX∞(p∞, 2)(cid:1) × B Rk

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

that sends each (y, v) pair to the unique point y′ ∈ X∞ with the property that
u∞(y′) = v and dX∞(y, y′) = |u∞(y) − u∞(y′)|. Moreover, this map is injec-
tive (by Lemma 11.4) and its image contains BX∞(p∞, 1) (by Lemma 11.5). By
Lemma 11.4, the map Φ induces an isometry between the 1-ball around (p∞, 0k)
in

and BX∞(p∞, 1).

12. Curvature estimates under cone regularity assumption

In this section we derive bounds on the volume of the sublevel sets {rRm < s}
on Y -tame and Y -regular singular spaces with mild singularities of codimension
p0 > 3. These bounds will be obtained by adapting the techniques developed by
Cheeger and Naber in [CN13] to our setting. The bounds on the volume of the
sublevel sets of {rRm < s} imply Lp-bounds on r−1
Rm and they can also be used to
bound the Hausdorﬀ dimension of singular sets that occur as we analyze limits of
degenerations Xi of singular spaces. The possible values of p or, equivalently, the
Hausdorﬀ dimension of the singular set depend on a working condition, which
states that Gromov-Hausdorﬀ closeness to metric products of the form Y × Rn−e
implies local regularity. This working condition is true for e = 0 by default, by
Corollary 1.4. In subsection 13, we will improve this working condition to e = 2,
giving us stronger Lp-bounds.

Proposition 12.1. For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is an E =
E(ε, p0, Y ) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space that has mild singularities of codimension p0. Assume
moreover that X is Y -tame at some scale r > 0 and that Ric ≥ −(n − 1)r−2 on
R. Assume that for some e ∈ {0, . . . , n} the following property holds: If p′ ∈ X,
0 < r′ < r and if there exists a metric cone (Z, dZ, z) with vertex z such that

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)B(p′, r′), p′(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rn−e

then rRm(p′) > εr′.

((z, 0n−e), r′), (z, 0n−e)(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr′,

Then for any 0 < s < 1 and p ∈ X we have

|{0 < rRm < sr} ∩ B(p, r)| ≤ Es(e+1)−εrn.

(12.1)

(12.2)

Proof. This fact is proved in [CN13]. Note that this proof relies only on volume
comparison estimates, which hold due to Proposition 4.1, Cheeger and Colding’s
Cone-Splitting Theorem, which holds in the singular setting due to Theorem 1.5,
and estimates involving metric geometry, which can still be carried out in our
setting.
(cid:3)

So by Corollary 1.4 we have:

Corollary 12.2. For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is an E = E(ε, p0, Y ) <
∞ such that the following holds:

88

RICHARD H BAMLER

Let X be a singular space that has mild singularities of codimension p0. Assume
moreover that X is Y -tame and Y -regular at some scale r > 0 and that Ric = λg
on R for some |λ| ≤ (n − 1)r−2. Then for any 0 < s < 1 and p ∈ X we have

|{0 < rRm < sr} ∩ B(p, r)| ≤ Es1−εrn.

In the case in which e = 2 and the singular space is Einstein in Proposition 12.1,
we will soon replace the condition (12.1) by an only slightly stronger condition,
which will enable us to deduce (12.2) for e = 3. In order to do this, we need to
establish the following lemma.
Lemma 12.3. Let ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ and consider a sequence Xi
of singular spaces with mild singularities of codimension p0 that are Y -tame at
scale 1. Assume also that we have Ric ≥ −(n− 1) on the regular part of each Xi.
Let e ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}.
Assume that for any i, p ∈ Xi, 0 < r < 1 and every pointed metric space
(Z, dZ, z) the following holds: If

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BXi(p, r), p(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rn−e

((z, 0n−e), r)(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr,

then rRm(p) > εr.

Let now xi ∈ Xi and assume that the pointed metric spaces (Xi, di, xi) Gromov-
Hausdorﬀ converge to a metric space of the form (Z0×Rn−e−1, (z0, 0n−e−1)), where
(Z0, dZ0, z0) is a metric cone with vertex z0. Then Z0\{z0} is an e+1-dimensional
diﬀerentiable manifold and the metric dZ0 on Z0 \ {z0} is locally isometric to the
length metric of a C 3-Riemannian metric g∞ on Z0 \ {z0}.
Moreover, for any relatively compact, open U ⊂ Z0 \ {z0} and r > 0 there is
a sequence of C 3-diﬀeomorphisms Φi : U × B Rn−e−1(0n−e−1, r) → Ri such that
i gi → g∞ + gRn−e−1 in C 2 and such that the Φi converge to the identity map
Φ∗
with respect to some ﬁxed Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence (Xi, di, xi) → (Z0 ×
Rn−e−1, (z0, 0n−e−1)).
Proof. Let (Z ′
0. So we can identify Z0 \ {z0} with
0 × (0,∞). For any z = (z′, s) ∈ Z0 \ {z0} there is a 0 < r < 1 such that for
Z ′
some rescaling (Z, dZ) of (Z ′
dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BZ0×Rn−e−1
((z, 0n−e), r), (z, 0n−e)(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr/2.
Let pi ∈ Xi be a sequence of points such that pi → z with respect to some
Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence

((z, 0n−e−1), r), (z, 0n−e−1)(cid:1),
(cid:0)BZ×Rn−e

0) be the link of the cone Z ′

0, dZ ′

0) we have

0, dZ ′

(Xi, di, xi) → (Z0 × Rn−e−1, dZ0×Rn−e−1, (z0, 0n−e−1)).

Then, for suﬃciently large i, we have

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BXi(pi, r), pi(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rn−e

((z, 0n−e), r), (z, 0n−e)(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr.

So rRm(pi) > εr for large i. It follows that (z, 0n−e) is a regular point in Z0×Rn−e,
hence z is a regular point in Z0. The construction of the maps Φi follows by a
center of gravity construction.
(cid:3)

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

Using Lemma 12.3, we can now exclude the existence of 3-dimensional cones

and improve Proposition 12.1.
Proposition 12.4. For any ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is an E =
E(ε, p0, Y ) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space that has mild singularities of codimension p0. Assume
that X = (X, d,R, g) is Y -tame and Y -regular at some scale r > 0 and that
Ric = λg on R for some |λ| ≤ (n − 1)r−2. Assume that R is orientable and
assume that the following property holds:
If p′ ∈ X, 0 < r′ < r and if there exists a pointed metric space (Z, dZ, z) such

that

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)B(p′, r′), p′(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rn−2

then rRm(p) > εr′.

((z, 0n−2), r′), (z, 0n−2)(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr′,

(12.3)

Then for any 0 < s < 1 and p ∈ X we have

|{0 < rRm < sr} ∩ B(p, r)| ≤ Es4−εrn.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1. In view of Propo-
sition 12.1, we only need to verify that condition (12.1) holds for e = 3 and for
ε replaced by some ε′ = ε′(ε, Y ) > 0. So assume that this condition was false
for some ﬁxed ε, p0, Y . Then we can ﬁnd a sequence Xi of orientable singular
spaces with mild singularities of codimension p0 that are Y -tame and Y -regular
at scale 1 and that satisfy Ric = λigi on their regular parts for some |λi| ≤ n− 1.
Moreover, the Xi satisfy (12.3) and there are points pi ∈ Xi, scales ri > 0 and
metric cones (Zi, dZi) with vertex zi ∈ Zi such that

r−1

(12.4)

but r−1
generality that ri → ∞, λi → 0, rRm(xi) → 0 and

i dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BXi(pi, ri), pi(cid:1),(cid:0)BZi×Rn−3
i rRm(xi) → 0. After rescaling carefully, we may assume without loss of
dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)BXi(pi, ri), pi(cid:1),(cid:0)BZi×Rn−e−1

((zi, 0n−3, ri)), (zi, 0n−3)(cid:1)(cid:1) → 0.

((zi, 0n−3, ri)), (zi, 0n−3)(cid:1)(cid:1) → 0,

After passing to a subsequence, we may further assume that (Xi, dXi, xi) Gromov-
Hausdorﬀ converge to some metric space (Z∞, dZ∞, z∞). Due to (12.4), the
pointed metric spaces (Zi×Rn−3, dZi×Rn−3, (zi, 0n−3)) also Gromov-Hausdorﬀ con-
verge to (Z∞, dZ∞, z∞). Hence (Z∞, dZ∞, z∞) is isometric to (Z0× Rn−3, dZ0×Rn−3,
(z0, 0n−3)), where (Z0, dZ0, z0) is a metric cone with vertex z0.
By Lemma 12.3, we ﬁnd that Z0\{z0} is a 3-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold
and dZ0 is locally isometric to the length metric of a C 2 Riemannian metric g0 on
Z0 \ {z0}. This metric must be Ricci ﬂat and hence, since Z0 is 3-dimensional,
locally ﬂat. It follows that Z0 is isometric to a union of copies of R3 and/or R3/Z2
along their tips. By the last part of Lemma 12.3 and our assumption that Ri are
orientable, we can exclude the cones R3/Z2.

So Z0 is isometric to the union of copies of R3 along their tips and hence

|BZ0×Rn−3

((y0, 0n−3), 1) ∩ ((Z0 \ {z0}) × Rn−3)| ≥ ωn.

So, again by the last part of Lemma 12.3, we ﬁnd that
i→∞ |BXi(pi, 1) ∩ Ri| ≥ ωn
lim inf

So, by the Y -regularity of the Xi, we must have rRm(pi) > Y −1 for large i, which
contradicts our assumptions.

13. Codimension 4 and proof of Theorem 1.6

In this section, we verify the condition (12.3) in Proposition 12.4 and prove
Theorem 1.6. We will largely follow the work of Cheeger and Naber (cf [CN15])
with a few simpliﬁcations.

We ﬁrst prove the following lemma:

Lemma 13.1. For every ε > 0 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, Y ) > 0 such that
the following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0 > 2. Assume that X is Y -tame at scale δ−1r for some r > 0 and that
|Ric| ≤ (n − 1)δr−2 on R.
Let p ∈ X and let u : B(p, 2r) → Rk be a δ-splitting map for some k ≤ n.
Deﬁne for all 1 ≤ l ≤ k the following k-form on R:
ωl := du1 ∧ . . . ∧ dul.
r2ˆB(p,r)∩R

d|µ△|ωl|| < εrn.

Then

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that r = 1. We will furthermore
ﬁx l and set ω := ωl.
First observe that

∇ω = ∇du1 ∧ . . . ∧ dul + . . . + du1 ∧ . . . ∧ ∇dul.

So, for some generic constant C < ∞,

|∇ω| ≤ C(cid:0)|∇2u1| + . . . + |∇2ul|(cid:1).

It follows that

ˆB(p,2)∩R |∇ω|2dg ≤ Cδ2.

(13.1)

Next, we ﬁnd that for some local orthonormal frame {ej}i=1,...,n,

△ω =

lXj1,j2=1

nXi=1

du1 ∧ . . . ∧ ∇eiduj1 ∧ . . . ∧ ∇eiduj2 ∧ . . . ∧ dul

+ Ric(du1) ∧ . . . ∧ dul + . . . + du1 ∧ . . . ∧ Ric(dul).

So

|△ω| ≤ C(cid:0)|∇2u1|2 + . . . + |∇2ul|2(cid:1) + Cδ2.

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

91

Therefore,

ˆB(p,2)∩R |△ω| ≤ Cδ2.

(13.2)

Let now φ ∈ C 2(B(p, 2) ∩ R) be a non-negative function such that |∇φ| < 10,
φ ≡ 1 on B(p, 1) ∩ R and such that φ ≡ 0 outside B(p, 1.5) ∩ R. Fix moreover
a sequence si → 0. Similarly as in the proof of Lemma 8.3, we can construct
functions ηi ∈ C 2
c (B(p, 2) ∩ R) such that supp ηi ⊂ {rRm > si} ∩ B(p, 2) ⊂ Ui,
ηi ≡ 1 on {rRm > 2si} and |∇ηi| < Cs−1
c (R) and ηiφ → 1 pointwise
on B(p, 1) ∩ R as i → ∞. Then, by Proposition 2.5 and (13.1),
ˆB(p,2)∩R

ηiφdµ△|ω| = −ˆR ∇(ηiφ)∇|ω|

. So ηiφ ∈ C 2

(cid:12)(cid:12){rRm < 2si} ∩ B(p, 2) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12)1/2δ

Since X has singularities of codimension p0 > 2, we ﬁnd
ηiφdµ△|ω| ≤ Cδ.

i→∞ ˆB(p,2)∩R

lim sup

Next, we claim that

To see this, let ψ ∈ C 2
tion and note that by Proposition 2.5

dµ△|ω| ≥ −|△ω|dg

(13.3)
c (R) be some non-negative and compactly supported func-

ψdµ△|ω| = ˆR

(△ψ)|ω|dg = lim

α→0ˆR

(△ψ)p|ω|2 + α dg
α→0ˆR

= lim

ψ△p|ω|2 + α dg.

(13.4)

For any α > 0 we obtain as in (2.7) in the proof of Proposition 2.5

Combining this with (13.4) yields (13.3).

△p|ω|2 + α ≥ −|△ω|.

By (13.2) we have

lim sup

i→∞ ˆB(p,2)∩R

ηiφ(cid:0)2|△ω|dg + dµ△|ω|(cid:1) ≤ Cδ + Cδ2.

92

RICHARD H BAMLER

By (13.3), the integrand of this integral is non-negative.

ˆB(p,1)∩R

d|µ△|ω|| ≤ ˆB(p,1)∩R(cid:0)2d(µ△|ω|)− + dµ△|ω|(cid:1)

≤ ˆB(p,1)∩R(cid:0)2|△ω|dg + dµ△|ω|(cid:1) ≤ Cδ + Cδ2.

This proves the desired result.

(cid:3)

We now deﬁne the singular scale sδ

x as in [CN15].

Deﬁnition 13.2 (cf [CN15, Deﬁnition 1.30]). Let X be a singular space, p ∈ X
and r > 0. Consider a continuous, vector-valued function u = (u1, . . . , uk) :
B(p, 2) → Rk such that u|B(p,2)∩R is C 3 and deﬁne for all 1 ≤ l ≤ k the following
k-form on R:

ωl := du1 ∧ . . . ∧ dul.

For any x ∈ B(p, 1) and δ > 0 we deﬁne the singular scale sδ
x ≥ 0 as the inﬁmum
of all radii 0 < s ≤ 1/2 such that for all r with s ≤ r < 1/2 and 1 ≤ l ≤ k we
have

r2ˆB(x,r)∩R

d|µ△|ωl|| ≤ δˆB(x,r)∩R |ωl|.

(13.5)

With this deﬁnition in hand, we can prove the Transformation Theorem.

Proposition 13.3 (Transformation Theorem, cf [CN15, Theorem 1.32]). For
every ε > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is a δ = δ(ε, p0, Y ) > 0 such that the
following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0. Assume that X is Y -tame and Y -regular at scale δ−1. Assume moreover that
Ric = λg on R for some |λ| ≤ (n − 1)δ2.
Let p ∈ X and let u : B(p, 2) → Rk be a δ-splitting map for some k ≤ n.
Then for any x ∈ B(p, 1) and sδ
x ≤ r < 1/2 there is a lower triangular matrix
A = A(x, r) ∈ Rk×k with positive diagonal entries such that Au|B(x,r) is an ε-
splitting.

Proof. We argue as in [CN15, subsec 3.2]. First observe that we may assume
without loss of generality that ε < ε∗ for some uniform constant ε∗ > 0, which
we will determine in the course of the proof. Assume by induction on k that
the proposition holds for k replaced by 1, . . . , k − 1 (If k = 1, then we make
no assumption). We will show in the following by contradiction that then the
proposition also holds for k. So ﬁx ε > 0, p0 > 3, Y < ∞ and assume that no δ
exists for which the Proposition holds for k. Then we can ﬁnd a sequence δj → 0
and a sequence Xj of singular spaces with mild singularities of codimension p0
that are Y -tame and Y -regular at scale δ−1
and that satisfy Ric = λjgj on Rj
for some |λj| ≤ (n − 1)δ2
j . Moreover, we can ﬁnd points pj ∈ Xj, δj-splitting
maps uj : B(pj, 2) → Rk for δj → 0, points xj ∈ B(pj, 1) and rj ∈ [sδj
xj , 1/2]
such that there is now lower triangular matrix A with positive diagonal entries

j

STRUCTURE THEORY OF SINGULAR SPACES

93

such that Auj|B(xj,rj) is an ε-splitting. By Lemma 13.1 we have sδj
xj , rj → 0, since
otherwise uj|B(xj ,rj) would be a δ′-splitting for inﬁnitely many j and an arbitrary
small δ′ > 0 and hence (13.5) would hold for inﬁnitely many j. Without loss
of generality, we may furthermore assume that each rj is chosen maximal in the
following sense: for any j and any r ∈ [2rj, 1/2] the proposition holds, that is,
there is a lower triangular matrix A ∈ Rk×k with positive diagonal entries such
that Auj|B(xj ,r) is an ε-splitting. Let us now use this assumption for r ← 4rj and
choose such matrices Aj ∈ Rk×k such that Ajuj|B(xj ,4rj) are ε-splittings.
Next, we rescale each singular Ricci ﬂat space Xj by r−1
and denote the result
by X ′
j Xj. From now on we will almost exclusively consider the spaces
X ′
j and any geometric object or quantity will be understood with respect to this
sequence of rescaled spaces. Moreover, we consider the rescaled functions

j := r−1

j

vj := r−1

j Aj(uj − uj(xj)),
j of X ′

which are harmonic on the regular parts R′
j. So vj|B(xj ,1) is not an ε-
splitting, but vj|B(xj ,4) is. Moreover, for any r ∈ [4, r−1
j /2] there is a lower trian-
gular matrix Ar,j ∈ Rk×k with positive diagonal entries such that Ar,jvj|B(xj ,r) is
an ε-splitting. We may also assume that A4,j = Ik =: I is the identity matrix.
For the rest of the proof let C < ∞ be some generic constant that only depends

on Y, p0 and n and we set for all 1 ≤ l ≤ k
j ∧ . . . ∧ dvl
j /2] we have

Claim 1. For each j and r ∈ [4, r−1

ωl
j := dv1

j ∈ Ωl(R′
j).

|A4r,jA−1

r,j − I| < Cε.

Proof. The proof is the same as in [CN15, sec 3.2, proof of Claim 1]. Note that
we have expressed the identity above in a slightly diﬀerent but equivalent way.
The fact that the X ′
j are singular does not create any issues since no arguments
are used in the proof that require the regular parts R′
(cid:3)

j to be complete.
As in [CN15], we conclude from Claim 1 that for all j and r ∈ [4, r−1

r,jvj|B(xj ,r) : B(xj, r) → Rk are Cε-splittings and such that the restricted maps

are εj(r)-splittings, where εj(r) → 0 for j → ∞ and ﬁxed r. Moreover, for each
r ≥ 4 and l = 1, . . . , k − 1,

ˆB(xj ,r)∩R′

j

|∇2vl

j|2 → 0.

(13.7)

Proof. This fact, which is almost the same as [CN15, sec 3.2, proof of Claim
2], follows similarly as in [CN15]. Fix r ≥ 4. By the inductive assumption,
we can ﬁnd lower triangular (k − 1) × (k − 1) matrices eAj,r ∈ R(k−1)×(k−1)
such that eAj,r projRk−1×0(vj)|B(xj ,r) are eεj(r)-splittings for eεj(r) → 0.
In par-
ticular, eAj,r projRk−1×0(vj)|B(xj ,4) are eε′
j(r) → 0. Since the
maps projRk−1×0(vj)|B(xj ,4) are ε-splittings, we conclude, using similar arguments
as in the proof of Claim 1, that |eAj,r − Ik−1| < Cε for large j, where Ik−1 denotes
j,r = eAj,r ⊕ id0k−1⊕R, then the
the identity (k − 1)× (k − 1)-matrix. So if we set A′
ﬁrst part of the claim follows.
Lastly, identity (13.7) holds since for each l = 1, . . . , k − 1

j(r)-splittings for eε′

j(cid:12)(cid:12)∇2(cid:0)eAj,rvj(cid:1)l(cid:12)(cid:12)2 → 0

ˆB(xj ,r)∩R′
j,r| are uniformly bounded for small enough ε∗.

(cid:3)

and the inverse matrices |eA−1

We now take a slightly diﬀerent route from [CN15] in order to avoid having
to use the theory of singular spaces with lower Ricci curvature bounds. First,
we note that due to Claim 2, we may replace vj by A′
4,jvj. Then we still have
(13.6a)–(13.6d) and (13.7). Moreover, we get that (v1
)|B(xj,4) is an εj-
splitting for some sequence εj → 0. Finally, we mention that due to Deﬁnition
13.2 and (13.6c) we have

Proof. The identities (13.9) and (13.10) follow using the same technique. In order
to present the proof only once, we set

Identity (13.13b) follows similarly using (13.13a), the fact that △∇vl
j = 0 on R′

and local elliptic regularity. In order to show (13.13c), note that by (13.6b) we

kernel from item (5) of the Y -tameness assumptions (cf. Deﬁnition 1.12). Note
that due to the Gaussian bounds from these tameness properties and Proposition

Using (13.13d), we hence obtain the following statement for suﬃciently small ε∗:
For every α, τ > 0 and T < ∞ there are J = J(α, τ, T ), S0 = S0(α, τ, T ) < ∞
such that if j > J, S > S0, then for any y ∈ B(xj, 4) ∩ R′

So, given y, we may choose ρ small enough (depending on rRm(y)) to make the
ﬁrst term on the right-hand side arbitrarily small. Next we can choose τ small
enough to make the second and third term arbitrarily small. We then obtain the
following statement: For any α, s > 0 and T < ∞ there are J = J(α, s, T ), S0 =
S0(α, s, T ) < ∞ such that if j > J and S > S0, then we have for large i

So if ε∗ is small enough such that Cε∗ < 1, then the right-hand side can be
made arbitrarily small for large T . So we obtain the following statement: For
any α, s > 0 there are T = T (α, s), J = J(α, s), S0 = S0(α, s) < ∞ such that for
S > S0, j > J, any y1, y2 ∈ B(xj, 4) ∩ {rRm > s} and for large i (depending on

Combining the statement involving (13.14) with the statement involving (13.15),
we conclude: For all α, s > 0 there is J = J(α, s) < ∞ such that for any
y1, y2 ∈ B(xj, 4) ∩ {rRm > s} we have

We can ﬁnally derive (13.12): For any s > 0 and we have, using Corollary 12.2

|fj(y1) − fj(y2)| < α.

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side goes to 0 as j → ∞ by Claim 3, the
second and third term go to 0 as j → ∞ since (v1

splitting for εj → 0 and al
j are uniformly bounded. So we obtain that for any

Lemma 13.4 (Weak Version of Slicing Theorem, cf [CN15, Theorem 1.23]). For
every ε, α > 0, p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there are δ = δ(ε, α, p0, Y ) > 0 such that the
following holds:
Let X = (X, d,R, g) be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension
p0. Assume that X is Y -tame and Y -regular at scale δ−1. Assume moreover that
Ric = λg on R for some |λ| ≤ (n − 1)δ2.
Let p ∈ X and u : B(p, 1) → Rn−2 a δ-splitting map. Then there is an s ∈ Rn−2
such that:
(a) u−1(s) ∩ B(p, α) 6= ∅,
(b) for all x ∈ u−1(s) and 0 < r ≤ 1/10 there is a lower triangular matrix A
with positive diagonal entries such that Au|B(x,r) : B(x, r) → Rn−2 is an
ε-splitting map.

(c) u−1(s) ∩ B(p, 1/2) ⊂ R,

Proof. The proof is follows as in [CN15], using Proposition 13.3. Following the
lines of the proof yields a subset U ⊂ Rn−2 of non-zero measure such that asser-
tions (a) and (b) hold for all s ∈ U. To ensure assertion (c), it remains to check
that U 6⊂ u(B(p, 1/2) \ R). To see this, ﬁx some 0 < σ < 1/10 and consider a
minimal 2σ-net z1, . . . , zN ∈ B(p, 1/2) ∩ {rRm < σ} of B(p, 1/2) ∩ {rRm < σ}.

102

RICHARD H BAMLER

Then B(z1, σ), . . . , B(zN , σ) ⊂ B(p, 1) ∩ {rRm < 2σ} are pairwise disjoint and
hence for some generic constant C∗ < ∞, which may depend on X , but not on
σ, we have

N < C∗σ−n|B(p, 1) ∩ {0 < rRm < 2σ}| < C∗σ−nσ3.

On the other hand, the balls B(z1, 2σ), . . . , B(zN , 2σ) cover B(p, 1/2)∩{rRm < σ}
and thus, for suﬃciently small δ, the balls B(u(z1), 4σ), . . . , B(u(zN ), 4σ) cover
u(B(p, 1/2) ∩ {rRm < σ}). It follows that

(cid:12)(cid:12)u(cid:0)B(p, 1/2) ∩ {rRm < σ}(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C∗σnσ−n+3 < C∗σ3.

Letting σ → 0 yields |u(B(p, 1/2) \ R)| = 0 and therefore we have indeed U 6⊂
u(B(p, 1/2) \ R).

(cid:3)

We can now verify condition (12.3) in Proposition 12.4.

Lemma 13.5. For every p0 > 3 and Y < ∞ there is an ε = ε(p0, Y ) > 0 such
that the following holds:
Let X be a singular space with mild singularities of codimension p0. Assume
that X is Y -tame and Y -regular at scale r for some r > 0. Assume moreover
that Ric = λg on R for some |λ| ≤ (n − 1)r−2.

Assume that there is a pointed metric space (Z, dZ, z) such that

dGH(cid:0)(cid:0)B(p, r), p(cid:1),(cid:0)BZ×Rn−2

Then rRm(p) > εr.

((z, 0n−2), r), (z, 0n−2)(cid:1)(cid:1) < εr.

(13.22)

Proof. Using Proposition 11.1 and rescaling, we may replace the assumption
(13.22) of the lemma by the assumption that there is an ε-splitting map u :
B(p, 1) → Rn−2, that X is Y -tame and Y -regular at scale ε−1 and that the Ein-
stein constant satisﬁes |λ| ≤ (n − 1)ε2. We now need to show that we have
rRm(p) > ε.
Assume that this was not the case for some ﬁxed Y and p0. Then we can ﬁnd
a sequence εi → 0 and a sequence of singular spaces Xi with mild singularities of
codimension p0 that are Y -tame and Y -regular at scale ε−1
and satisfy Ric = λgi
on Ri for some |λi| ≤ (n − 1)ε2
i . Moreover, we can ﬁnd points pi ∈ Xi and εi-
splitting maps ui : B(pi, 1) → Rn−2 such that rRm(pi) ≤ εi. Using Lemma 13.4,
we can ﬁnd a sequence αi → 0 and a sequence si ∈ Rn−2 such that assertions
(a)–(c) hold. Note that for any x ∈ u−1(si) ∩ B(pi, αi) 6= ∅ we have rRm(x) <
rRm(pi) + αi ≤ εi + αi. For each i pick a point xi ∈ u−1
i (si) ∩ B(pi, 1/2) where
rRm(·)(1/2 − d(pi,·))−1 attains its minimum. Then

i

rRm(xi)(cid:0)1/2 − d(pi, xi)(cid:1)−1 < (εi + αi)(1/2 − αi)−1 → 0.

Rescale each Xi now by r−1

to some pointed metric space (X∞, dX∞, x∞) and convergence of the (uniformly
Lipschitz) maps u′′
i to some 1-Lipschitz u∞ : X∞ → Rn−2. With the help of
Proposition 11.1, we conclude that (X∞, dX∞) is isometric to a Cartesian product
Z∞ × Rn−2 for some complete metric length space (Z∞, d∞). We will henceforth
assume that X∞ = Z∞ × Rn−2. We will moreover assume that x∞ corresponds to
the point (z∞, 0n−2) for some z∞ ∈ Z∞ and that u∞ : X∞ = Z∞ × Rn−2 → Rn−2
corresponds to the projection onto the second factor.

(13.23)

e.g. by specifying a sequence of almost-isometries on larger and larger balls. We
now claim that for every z ∈ Z∞ there is a sequence yi ∈ X ′
i that converges to
(z, 0n−2) with respect to (13.23) such that rRm(yi) > 1/10 for inﬁnitely many i.
Call every point z ∈ Z∞ that satisﬁes this claim smooth. By the choice of the
points xi, we know that z∞ is smooth. Consider now a smooth point z ∈ Z∞ and
i be the corresponding sequence that converges to (z, 0n−2). Then, after
let yi ∈ X ′
passing to a subsequence, the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence (13.23) is actually
C 3 on BZ∞×Rn−2((z, 0n−2), 1/100) and the convergence u′′
i → u∞ happens in
i ∈ X ′
C 2. So, since u′′
i) → 0 such
i) − s′′
that u′′
i (y′
i) = si and, by our previous discussion,
that rRm(y′
i) > 1/2 for large i. Therefore, all points in BZ∞(z, 1/4) are smooth.
Summarizing our arguments, we have shown that for any smooth z ∈ Z∞, all
points in BZ∞(z, 1/4) are smooth. As Z∞ is a length space, it follows that all
points of Z∞ are smooth.

i (yi)−s′′
i = 0. This implies u′

i → 0, we can ﬁnd points y′

i − s′′
i with dX ′

i(yi, y′

i(y′

So (Z∞, dZ∞) is the length space of complete 2-dimensional Riemannian metric
gZ∞ of regularity C 2 and the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence (13.23) is C 3 in a
neighborhood of Z∞ × {0n−2}. As the limiting metric must be Ricci ﬂat, we
conclude that gZ∞ is locally ﬂat. So the limit Z∞ × Rn−2 is ﬂat as well. Using
Corollary 1.4, we conclude that the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence (13.23) is C 3
everywhere. Thus rRm(z∞, 0n−2) = limi→∞ rRm(xi) = 1, which contradicts the
ﬂatness of the limit.
(cid:3)

We can now prove the main theorem of this paper, Theorem 1.6.

Proof of Theorem 1.6. The theorem is a consequence of Proposition 12.4 and
Lemma 13.5.
