TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

JACK ARCE, JORGE A. GUCCIONE, JUAN J. GUCCIONE, AND CHRISTIAN VALQUI

Abstract. We ﬁnd three families of twisting maps of K m with K n. One of them is related
to truncated quiver algebras, the second one consists of deformations of the ﬁrst and the third
one requires m = n and yields algebras isomorphic to Mn(K). Using these families and some
exceptional cases we construct all twisting maps of K 3 with K 3.

Introduction

Let A, C be unitary K-algebras, where K is a ﬁeld. By deﬁnition, a twisted tensor product of A
with C over K, is an algebra structure deﬁned on A⊗K C, with unit 1⊗1, such that the canonical
maps iA : A → A ⊗K C and iC : C → A ⊗K C are algebra maps satisfying a ⊗ c = iA(a)iC (c).
When K is a commutative ring this structure was introduced independently in [13] and [17],
and it has been formerly studied by many people with diﬀerent motivations (In addition to the
previous references see also [1], [2], [4], [3], [5], [8], [14], [10], [18]). A number of examples of
classical and recently deﬁned constructions in ring theory ﬁts into this construction. For instance,
Ore extensions, skew group algebras, smash products, etcetera (for the deﬁnitions and properties
of these structures we refer to [15] and [11]). On the other hand, it has been applied to braided
geometry and it arises as a natural representative for the product of noncommutative spaces,
this being based on the existing duality between the categories of algebraic aﬃne spaces and
commutative algebras, under which the cartesian product of spaces corresponds to the tensor
product of algebras. And last, but not least, twisted tensor products arise as a tool for building
algebras starting with simpler ones.

Given algebras A and C, a basic problem is to determine all the twisted tensor products of A
with C. To our knowledge, the ﬁrst paper in which this problem was attacked in a systematic
way was [6], in which C. Cibils studied and completely solved the case C := K × K. In [9],the
case C := K n is analysed and some partial classiﬁcation result were achieved.

In this paper we consider the case A = K m and C = K n. It is well known that there is a
canonical bijection between the twisted tensor products of A with C and the so called twisting
maps χ : C ⊗k A → A ⊗k C. So each twisting map χ is associated with a twisted tensor product
of A with C over K, which will be denoted by A ⊗χ C.

It is evident that each K-linear map χ : K n ⊗ K m → K m ⊗ K n determines and is determined

by unique scalars λkl

ij , such that

χ(ei ⊗ fj) =Xk,l

λkl
ij fk ⊗ el

for all ei and fj.

Given such a map χ, for all i, l ∈ N∗
denote the matrices deﬁned by

m and j, k ∈ N∗

n, we let A(i, l) ∈ Mn(K) and B(j, k) ∈ Mm(K)

A(i, l)kj := λkl

ij =: B(j, k)li.

In Proposition 2.3 we show that χ is a twisting map if and only if these matrices satisfy certain
(easily veriﬁable) conditions. This transforms the problem of ﬁnding all twisting maps into a
problem of linear algebra. When one tries to ﬁnd all twisting maps of K 3 with K 3 using this
linear algebra approach, one encounters that nearly all cases of twisting maps have a very special
form. We call these twisting maps standard and prove that the resulting twisted tensor product
algebras are isomorphic to certain square zero radical truncated quiver algebras. Moreover, there
arises a second type of twisting maps, which we call quasi-standard twisting maps, which yield
algebras which corresponds to a formal deformation of the latter case, whenever the corresponding
quiver has a triangle which is not a cycle. We also construct a third family of twisting maps
when n = m, and we show that the resulting algebras are isomorphic to Mn(K).

These three families cover nearly all twisting maps of K 3 with K 3. We ﬁnd additionally some
extensions of the algebras corresponding to the third family in the case K 2 with K 2, and one
additional case.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 1 we make a quick review of twisting maps and
the n − 1-ary cross product of vectors. In section 2 we present the characterization in terms of
matrices of the twisting maps of K n with K m and some basic results, specially on isomorphism
of twisting maps and a basic representation on Mn(K).

TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

In section 3 we reprove the results of [6] in our language. In section 4 we prove some basic
results on the idempotent matrices A(i, l), and pay special attention to the case of rk = 1,
where a family arises with algebras isomorphic to Mn(K). In section 5 we deﬁne standard and
quasi-standard twisting columns and twisting maps and prove several results about them. In
section 6 we classify completely the case of reduced rank 1. In section 7 we explore the relation of
standard twisting maps and quiver algebras, and also the case of quasi-standard twisting maps.
In section 8 we use all results in order to classify the twisting maps in low dimensional cases,
including all the twisting maps which are not quasi-standard in the case K 3 with K 3. In the
appendix we list all standard and quasi-standard twisting maps of K 3 with K 3.

1 Preliminaries

Let K be a ﬁeld. From now on we assume implicitly that all the maps whose domain and
codomain are K-vector spaces are K-linear maps and that all the algebras are over K. Next we
introduce some notations and make some comments.

i := {1, . . . , i}.

- K × := K \ {0}.
- For each natural number i, we set N∗
- The tensor product over K is denoted by ⊗, without any subscript.
- Given a matrix X we let X T denote the transpose matrix of X. Moreover, we denote with
a juxtaposition the multiplication of two matrices and with a bullet the multiplication
in K n. So, (a1, . . . , an) (cid:5) (b1, . . . , bn) = (a1b1, . . . , anbn). Note that a = (a1, . . . , an) is
invertible respect to the multiplication map (cid:5) if and only if µn(a) := a1 · · · an 6= 0. In
this case we let a(cid:5) denote the inverse (a−1

1 , . . . , a−1

n ) of a.

- We let Eij ∈ Mn(K) denote the matrix with 1 in the i, j-entry and 0 otherwise. So,

{Eij : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is the canonical basis of Mn(K).

- For the sake of simplicity we write 1 = 1n = 1K n := (1, . . . , 1)T .
- The symbol τnm denotes the ﬂip K n ⊗ K m −→ K n ⊗ K m.

1.1 Twisting maps

Let A, C be unitary algebras. Let µA, ηA, µC and ηC be the multiplication and unit maps of A
and C, respectively. A twisted tensor product of A with C is an algebra structure on the K-vector
space A ⊗ C, such that the canonical maps

iA : A −→ A ⊗ C and iC : C −→ A ⊗ C

are algebra homomorphisms and µ ◦ (iA ⊗ iC) = idA⊗C , where µ denotes the multiplication map
of the twisted tensor product.

Assume we have a twisted tensor product of A with C. Then, the map

χ : C ⊗ A −→ A ⊗ C,

deﬁned by χ := µ ◦ (iC ⊗ iA), satisﬁes:

(1) χ ◦ (ηC ⊗ A) = A ⊗ ηC ,
(2) χ ◦ (C ⊗ ηA) = ηA ⊗ C,
(3) χ ◦ (µC ⊗ A) = (A ⊗ µC ) ◦ (χ ⊗ C) ◦ (C ⊗ χ),
(4) χ ◦ (C ⊗ µA) = (µA ⊗ C) ◦ (A ⊗ χ) ◦ (χ ⊗ A).

4

J. ARCE, JORGE A. GUCCIONE, JUAN J. GUCCIONE, AND C. VALQUI

A map satisfying these conditions is called a twisting map of C with A. Conversely, if

χ : C ⊗ A −→ A ⊗ C

is a twisting map, then A ⊗ C becomes a twisted tensor product via

µχ := (µA ⊗ µC ) ◦ (A ⊗ χ ⊗ C).

This algebra will be denoted by A ⊗χ C. Furthermore, these constructions are inverse one to
each other.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let χ : C ⊗ A −→ A ⊗ C and χ′ : C′ ⊗ A′ −→ A′ ⊗ C′ be twisting maps. A
morphism Fgh : χ → χ′, from χ to χ′, is a pair (g, h) of algebra maps g : C → C′ and h : A → A′
such that χ′ ◦ (g ⊗ h) = (h ⊗ g) ◦ χ.

Remark 1.2. Let χ and χ′ be as above. If Fgh : χ → χ′ is a morphism of twisting maps, then
the map h ⊗ g : A ⊗χ C −→ A′ ⊗χ′ C′ is a morphism of algebras. Moreover this correspondence
is functorial in an evident sense.

Remark 1.3. Let h : A → A′ and g : C → C′ be isomorphisms of algebras. If

χ′ : C′ ⊗ A′ −→ A′ ⊗ C′

is a twisting map, then χ := (h−1 ⊗ g−1) ◦ χ′ ◦ (g ⊗ h) is also. Moreover Fgh : χ → χ′ is an
isomorphism.

Proposition 1.4. Let χ : (B × C) ⊗ A −→ A ⊗ (B × C) be a twisting map. Denote by ιB, ιC ,
pB, pC be the evident inclusions and projections. The map χB : B ⊗ A −→ A ⊗ B, deﬁned by

χB := (A ⊗ pB) ◦ χ ◦ (ιB ⊗ A),

is a twisting map if and only if (A ⊗ pB) ◦ χ ◦ (ιC ⊗ A) = 0. Moreover in this case FpB ,idA is a
morphism of twisting maps from χ to χB. We say that pB(χ) := χB is the twisting map of B
with A induced by χ and that χ is an extension of χB.

Proof. Since χ is a twisting map

χ(cid:0)(1B, 0) ⊗ a(cid:1) = χ(cid:0)(1B, 1C) ⊗ a(cid:1) − χ(cid:0)(0, 1C) ⊗ a(cid:1)
= a ⊗ (1B, 1C) − χ(cid:0)(0, 1C) ⊗ a(cid:1)
= a ⊗ (1B, 1C) + a ⊗ (0, 1C) − χ(cid:0)(0, 1C) ⊗ a(cid:1).
a ⊗ 1B = χB(1B ⊗ a) = a ⊗ 1B − (A ⊗ pB) ◦ χ(cid:0)(0, 1C) ⊗ a(cid:1),
or, equivalently, (A ⊗ pB) ◦ χ(cid:0)(0, 1nC) ⊗ a(cid:1) = 0. Evaluating now the equalities

Consequently, if χB is also a twisting map, then

=

pB

=

pB pB

pB

in (0, 1C) ⊗ (0, c) ⊗ a for all c ∈ C and a ∈ A, we conclude that (A ⊗ pB) ◦ χ ◦ (ιC ⊗ A) = 0. We
leave to the reader the task to check the other assertions.

1.2 Cross product

We recall that the cross product is the (n−1)-ary operation

(v1, . . . , vn−1) 7→ v1 × · · · × vn−1

on K n, determined by

for all x ∈ K n. From this deﬁnition it follows immediately that v1×· · ·×vn−1 is orthogonal to the
subspace hv1, . . . , vn−1i generated by v1, . . . , vn−1, and that v1 × · · · × vn−1 = 0 if v1, . . . , vn−1
are not linearly independent. It is well known (and very easy to check) that

x
v1
...
vn−1



(v1 × · · · × vn−1)xT = det
v1 × · · · × vn−1 = det

v11
...

vn−1,1

. . .

,



where {e1, . . . , en} is the standard basis of K n, vi = (vi1, . . . , vin) and the determinant is com-
puted by the Laplace expansion along the ﬁrst row. From this it follows immediately that if X
is the matrix with rows x1, . . . , xn and columns y1, . . . , yn, then

Proposition 1.5. If x ∈ K n is invertible, then

(yT

1 × · · · ×cyT

j × · · · × yT

n ) (cid:5) ej = (x1 × · · · ×cxj × · · · × xn) (cid:5) ej

x (cid:5) (v1 × · · · × vn−1) = µn(x) (x(cid:5) (cid:5) v1) × · · · × (x(cid:5) (cid:5) vn−1),

for all j.

(1.1)

for all v1, . . . , vn−1 ∈ K n, where µn(x) = x1 · · · xn, as in the introduction.

Proof. This assertion is an immediate consequence of the fact that

y(cid:0)x (cid:5) (v1 × · · · × vn−1)(cid:1)T

for all y ∈ K n.

= (x (cid:5) y)(v1 × · · · × vn−1)T

(cid:3)

2 Twisted tensor products of K n with Km

Let χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m be a map and let {e1, . . . , em} and {f1, . . . , fn} be the canonical
bases of K m and K n, respectively. There exist unique scalars λkl

ij , such that

χ(ei ⊗ fj) =Xk,l

λkl
ij fk ⊗ el

for all ei and fj.

(2.2)

Given such a map χ, for all i, l ∈ N∗
denote the matrices deﬁned by

m and j, k ∈ N∗

n, we let A(i, l) ∈ Mn(K) and B(j, k) ∈ Mm(K)

A(i, l)kj := λkl

ij =: B(j, k)li.

(2.3)

6

J. ARCE, JORGE A. GUCCIONE, JUAN J. GUCCIONE, AND C. VALQUI

If necessary we will specify these map with a subscript, writing Aχ(i, l) and Bχ(j, k). Moreover,
m and B = Bχ denote the family (B(j, k))j,k∈N∗
we let A = Aχ denote the family (A(i, l))i,l∈N∗
n .

Notation 2.1. For each i, l ∈ N∗
n : A(i, l)jj = 1}. If there is no danger
of confusion (as is the case, for example, when we work with the matrices A(1, l), . . . , A(m, l)
of a ﬁxed column of A), we write Ji instead of Ji(l). Similarly, for each i, l ∈ N∗
n we set
m : Bχ(u, k)ii = 1}, and we write ˜Ju instead of ˜Ju(k) whenever there is no
˜Ju(k) := {i ∈ N∗
danger of confusion.

m we set Ji(l) := {j ∈ N∗

Remark 2.2. Let ˜χ := τmn ◦ χ ◦ τnm An immediate computation shows that

A ˜χ(i, l)kj = Bχ(i, l)kj

and

B ˜χ(j, k)li = Aχ(j, k)li

for each map χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m. Moreover ˜χ is a twisting map if and only if χ is. In
this case we say that χ and ˜χ are dual of each other.

Proposition 2.3. The map χ is a twisting map if and only if the following facts hold:

(1) δii′ A(i, l) = A(i, l)A(i′, l) for all i, i′ and l,
(2) δjj ′ B(j, k) = B(j, k)B(j′, k) for all j, j′ and k,
(3) A(i, l)1 = δil1 for all i and l,
(4) B(j, k)1 = δjk 1 for all j and k.

Proof. A direct computation shows that

χ ◦ (µKm ⊗ K n) = (K n ⊗ µKm) ◦ (χ ⊗ K m) ◦ (K m ⊗ χ)

if and only if

δii′ λkl

ij =

λkl
iuλul
i′j

for all i, i′, j, k, l,

which is equivalent to condition (1), and that

χ ◦ (K m ⊗ µK n ) = (µK n ⊗ K m) ◦ (K n ⊗ χ) ◦ (χ ⊗ K n)

if and only if

δjj ′ λkl

ij =

λku
ij λkl
uj ′

for all i, j, j′, k, l,

nXu=1

mXu=1

which is equivalent to condition (2). Finally it is easy to check that

χ ◦ (K m ⊗ ηK n ) = ηK n ⊗ K m

and

χ ◦ (ηKm ⊗ K n) = K n ⊗ ηKm

if and only if conditions (3) and (4) are fulﬁlled.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.4. Statement (1) says that for each l ∈ N∗
m, the matrices A(1, l), . . . , A(m, l) are a
family of orthogonal idempotents, and Statement (2) says that for each k ∈ N∗
n, the matrices
B(1, k), . . . , B(n, k) are also a family of orthogonal idempotents. Statement (1) implies that
Statement (3) holds if and only if 1K n belongs to the image of A(i, i) for all i. Similarly, if
Statement (2) is fulﬁlled, then Statement (4) is true if and only if 1Km ∈ Im B(j, j) for all j.

Corollary 2.5. The map χ is a twisting map if and only if the following conditions are fulﬁlled:

(1) δii′ A(i, l) = A(i, l)A(i′, l) for all i, i′ and l,
(2) A(i, l)1 = δil1 for all i and l,

i=1 A(i, l) = id for all l,
h=1 A(i, h)kj A(h, l)kj ′ = δjj ′ A(i, l)kj for all i, j, j′, k and l.

Proof. Conditions (1) and (2) are conditions (1) and (3) of Proposition 2.3. Since by (2.3),

condition (3) is equivalent to condition (4) of that proposition, and since, again by (2.3),

A(l, i)kj =

B(j, k)li,

mXi=1

mXi=1
mXu=1

A(u, l)kj A(i, u)kj ′ =

B(j, k)luB(j′, k)ui,

mXu=1

condition (4) is equivalent to condition (2) of the same proposition.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.6. By Remark 2.2 and the fact that χ is a twisting map if and only if ˜χ is, there is a
similar corollary with the matrices A(i, l) replaced by the matrices B(j, k).

Remark 2.7. Corollary 2.5(4) says in particular that the vector(cid:0)A(i, 1)kj , . . . , A(i, m)kj(cid:1) is or-
thogonal to the vector(cid:0)A(1, l)kj ′ , . . . , A(m, l)kj ′(cid:1) for each i, j, j′, k and l with j 6= j′.
Remark 2.8. Let X1, . . . , Xk ∈ Mn(K) such thatPk
shows that if Pk
Remark 2.9. Let X1, . . . , Xk ∈ Mn(K) be idempotent matrices such thatPk

j=1 Xj = idn. A straightforward computation
j=1 rk(Xj) ≤ n, then the Xi’s are orthogonal idempotents, which means that

the Xi’s are orthogonal idempotents. In fact, since rk(Xi) = Tr(Xi) and

XiXj = δij Xi for all i and j.

i=1 Xi = idn. Then

Tr(Xi) = Tr(cid:18)Xi

this follows from the Remark 2.8.

Remark 2.10. Fix k ∈ N∗
lary 2.5 (2) for this k). If the equality in Corollary 2.5(4) holds for all i, l and j = j′, then it
holds for all i, j, j′ and l. In fact, the assumptions guarantee that B(j, k) is idempotent for
each j ∈ N∗

Isomorphisms of twisting maps

Proposition 2.13. Two twisting maps χ, χ′ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m are isomorphic if and
only if there exists σ ∈ Sm and ς ∈ Sn such that

or, equivalently,

Aχ′ (i, l)kj = Aχ(σ(i), σ(l))ς(k)ς(j)

Bχ′ (j, k)li = Bχ(ς(j), ς(k))σ(l)σ(i).

Proof. By deﬁnition χ and χ′ are isomorphic if and only if there are algebra automorphisms
g : K m → K m and h : K n → K n such that χ′ = (h−1 ⊗g−1)◦χ◦(g⊗h). Since the automorphisms
of K n and K m are given by permutation of the entries, there exist ς ∈ Sn and σ ∈ Sm such that
g(ei) = eσ(i) and h(fj) = fς(j) for all i ∈ N∗

m and j ∈ N∗

χ′(ei ⊗ fj) = (h−1 ⊗ g−1)χ(eσ(i) ⊗ fς(j))

Now the result follows immediately from (2.2) and (2.3).

2.2 Representations in matrix algebras

In this subsection χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m denotes a twisting map and λkl
are as at the beginning of Section 2.

ij , A(i, l) and B(j, k)

Proposition 2.14. For each 1 ≤ u ≤ m the formulas

ρu(fj ⊗ 1) := Ejj

and ρu(1 ⊗ ei) := A(i, u)

deﬁne a representation ρu : K n ⊗χ K m −→ Mn(K). Similarly, for each 1 ≤ v ≤ n the formulas

˜ρv(1 ⊗ ei) := Eii

and

˜ρv(fj ⊗ 1) := B(j, v)

deﬁne a representation ˜ρv : K n ⊗χ K m −→ Mm(K).

Proof. Clearly the restriction of ρu to K n ⊗ K · 1 is a morphism of algebras. Moreover, by
items (1) and (3) of Corollary 2.5, the restriction of ρu to K · 1 ⊗ K m is also a morphism of
algebras. So, in order to prove that ρu deﬁnes a representation, it only remains to check that

But this is true, since, on one hand,

ρu(cid:0)(1 ⊗ ei)(fj ⊗ 1)(cid:1) = ρu(1 ⊗ ei)ρu(fj ⊗ 1).

and, on the other hand,

(1 ⊗ ei)(fj ⊗ 1) =Xk,l
A(i, u)Ejj =Xk,l

where the ﬁrst and the last equality are straightforward, the second equality is true by (2.3) and
the third one by Corollary 2.5(4). The proof for ˜ρv is similar.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.15. We can give a complete description of the image of ρu and ˜ρv. For this, note that
if A(i, u)kj 6= 0 for some i, j and k, then Ekj ∈ Im(ρu). In fact,

Ekj A(i, u)kj = EkkA(i, u)Ejj = ρu((fk ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ ei)(fj ⊗ 1)).

Hence

Ekj = ρu(cid:18) (fk ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ ei)(fj ⊗ 1)

A(i, u)kj

(cid:19) .

so, the image of ρu is the matrix incidence algebra of the preorder on {1, . . . , n} given by k ≤ j
if and only if Ekj ∈ Im(ρu). In particular, if for all k, j there exists a i with A(i, u)kj 6= 0, then
ρu is surjective. Similarly, the image of ˜ρv is the matrix incidence algebra of the preorder on
{1, . . . , m} given by l ≤ i if and only if Eli ∈ Im(˜ρu).

Remark 2.16. Set xji := fj ⊗ ei. A straightforward computation shows that in K n ⊗χ K m

xkixjl = λkl

ij xkl = A(i, l)kj xkl = B(j, k)lixkl.

We also can prove that all two sided ideals of the algebra K n ⊗χ K m are generated by monomials.

In fact, let I be an ideal and let x =Pr,s αrsxrs. Then

(fj ⊗ 1) Xr,s

αrsxrs! (1 ⊗ ei) =Xr,s

αrs(fj ⊗ 1)(fr ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ es)(1 ⊗ ei) = αjixji,

and so, if αji 6= 0 for some element x ∈ I, then xji ∈ I. This shows that the ideal I is linearly
generated by a set of elements xji.

3 Twisting maps of Km with K 2

The proofs given in this section could be lightly simpliﬁed using some of the results given in
Section 4, but we prefer to use the least machinery possible in order to give a ﬂavour of how our
methods work, reproducing the beautiful result of Cibils in [6]. Therefore we restrict ourselves
to use the results established in the previous sections and the following remark:

Remark 3.1. Let A ∈ M2(K) be such that A2 = A, A1 = 1 and rk(A) = 1. There exists a ∈ K
such that

A =(cid:18) a 1 − a
a 1 − a (cid:19) .

J. ARCE, JORGE A. GUCCIONE, JUAN J. GUCCIONE, AND C. VALQUI

The twisting maps of K m with K 2 have been classiﬁed completely by Cibils, who shows that
they correspond to colored quivers Qf,δ. The ﬁrst step is to describe the quiver Qf . We can
obtain this quiver directly from our A-rank matrix. Given an algebra map f : C → C, where
C := K m, we let fC denote that C-bimodule structure on C given by c · c′ · c′′ := f (c)c′c′′. Let
(ei)i∈N∗

m be the canonical basis of C.

Consider a map

χ : C ⊗

K[X]

hX(1 − X)i

−→

K[X]

hX(1 − X)i

⊗ C.

In [6, Section 3] it was proved that χ is a twisting map if and only if there exists an algebra
morphism f : C → C and an idempotent derivation δ : C → fC, satisfying f = f 2 + δf + f δ,
such that

χ(ei ⊗ X) = X ⊗ f (ei) + 1 ⊗ δ(ei) = X ⊗ (f + δ)(ei) + (1 − X) ⊗ δ(ei).

With our notations, we have

χ(ei ⊗ f1) =Xl (cid:0)λ1l

i1f1 ⊗ el + λ2l

i1f2 ⊗ el(cid:1) =Xl (cid:0)A(i, l)11f1 ⊗ el + A(i, l)21f2 ⊗ el(cid:1),

where f1 is the class of X in k[X]/hX(1 − X)i and f2 is the class of 1 − X in k[X]/hX(1 − X)i.
Hence

f (ei) =Xl (cid:0)A(i, l)11 − A(i, l)21(cid:1)el

and δ(ei) =Xl

A(i, l)21el.

(3.4)

The quiver Qf in [6] is constructed in the following way. Since f is an algebra map, there

exists a unique set map ϕ : N∗

m → N∗

m, such that

f (el) = X{i:ϕ(i)=l}

ei.

(3.5)

By deﬁnition, the quiver Qf of f has set of vertices N∗
i ∈ N∗

m.

m and an arrow from i to ϕ(i) for each

Proposition 3.2. Let χ be a twisting map and let f be as above. The adjacency matrix of the
quiver Qf is M (χ) := (Γχ − id)T , where Γχ is as in Deﬁnition 2.11.

Proof. Let l ∈ N∗
m. By Corollary 2.12 we know that rk(A(l, l)) = 2 and A(i, l) = 0 for all i 6= l,
or rk(A(l, l)) = 1 and there exists a unique i 6= l such that rk(A(i, l) = 1 and A(j, l) = 0 for all
j /∈ {i, l}. Thus, if rk(A(l, l)) = 2 then A(l, l) = id, and so A(l, l)11 − A(l, l)21 = 1. On the other
hand if rk(A(l, l)) = 1, then by Proposition 2.3 and Remark 3.1 there exists al ∈ K such that

A(l, l) =(cid:0) al 1−al
have A(i, l) =(cid:0) 1−al al−1

al 1−al(cid:1), and hence A(l, l)11 − A(l, l)21 = 0. Moreover, since A(i, l) + A(l, l) = id, we
al (cid:1), and so A(i, l)11 − A(i, l)21 = 1. Finally, if rk(A(j, l)) = 0, then (of

course) A(j, l)11 − A(j, l)21 = 0. Consequently, by the ﬁrst equality in (3.4) and equality (3.5),

−al

M (χ)il =(1

0

if ϕ(i) = l,
otherwise,

which ﬁnishes the proof.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.3. A vertex i of Qf is a loop vertex if and only if rk(A(i, i)) = 2.

In the rest of this section, for each i ∈ N∗

m we let ai denote A(i, i)11. We want to determine

the possible matrices A(i, l) which can occur in a twisting map of K m with K 2:

(1) If rk(A(l, l)) = 2, then A(l, l) = id and A(i, l) = 0 for all i 6= l.

TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

11

(2) If rk(A(l, l)) = 1, then there exists i 6= l such that

A(l, l) =(cid:18)al

al

1 − al

1 − al(cid:19) , A(i, l) =(cid:18)1 − al al − 1

al (cid:19) and A(h, l) = 0 for h /∈ {i, l}.

−al

Now we have several possibilities:

- If rk(A(i, i)) = 2, then A(l, i) = 0, and so, by (2.3) and Proposition 2.3(2),

al − a2

l = B(1, 1)ll − (B(1, 1)2)ll = 0,

(3.6)

which implies that al ∈ {0, 1}.

- If rk(A(i, i)) = 1, then we have A(i, i) =(cid:0) ai 1−ai

ai 1−ai(cid:1), and, again by (2.3) and Propo-

sition 2.3(2),

(1 − al)(1 − ai − al) = B(1, 1)li − (B(1, 1)2)li = 0

and

al(ai + al − 1) = B(2, 2)li − (B(2, 2)2)li = 0.

(3.7)

(3.8)

Hence ai + al = 1. If A(l, i) 6= 0, then we do not obtain additional conditions on al,
while if A(l, i) = 0, then, by (3.6), we have al ∈ {0, 1}, and so there are only two
cases: al = 0 and ai = 1 or al = 1 and ai = 0.

Next we recall the deﬁnition of a coloration on Qf in [6, Deﬁnition 3.12], but we take the

opposite coloration.

Deﬁnition 3.4. A coloration of Qf is an element c =Pi ciei ∈ C such that:

(1) For a connected component reduced to the round trip quiver with vertices i and j the

coeﬃcients ci and cj satisfy ci + cj = 1.

(2) For other connected components:

(a) In case i is a non loop vertex ci ∈ {0, 1}.
(b) For each arrow having no loop vertex target, one extremity value is 0 and the other

is 1.

(c) At a loop vertex i we have ci = 0.

Given a twisting map χ : K m ⊗ K 2 −→ K 2 ⊗ K m consider the matrices A(i, l) := Aχ(i, l).
By Proposition 3.2 and the discussion above Deﬁnition 3.4, the element c := (c1, . . . , cm) ∈ C
given by cl := A(l, l)21 is a coloration. Conversely, given a coloration c = (c1, . . . , cm) ∈ C on a
one-valued quiver Qf with set of vertices N∗
m, we can construct matrices A(i, l) ∈ M2(K) in the
following way: if l is a loop vertex, then A(l, l) := id and A(i, l) := 0 for i 6= l. Otherwise

- we set A(l, l) :=(cid:0) al 1−al
al (cid:1),
- for the target t(l) of the arrow starting at l, we set A(t(l), l) :=(cid:0) 1−al al−1

al 1−al(cid:1), where al := cl,

- for all i /∈ {t(l), l}, we set A(h, l) := 0.

−al

In order to verify that these matrices deﬁne a twisting map, we must check the conditions of
Proposition 2.3, where the matrices B(j, k) are deﬁned by (2.3). Conditions (1) and (3) are
satisﬁed by construction. Condition (2) is equivalent to

A(i, l)kj = δjk

for all l, j and k,

Xi

which holds, because

A(i, l)kj =(A(l, l)kj = δjk,

A(l, l)kj + A(t(l), l)kj = δjk,

if rk(A(l, l)) = 2
if rk(A(l, l)) = 1.

Xi

12

J. ARCE, JORGE A. GUCCIONE, JUAN J. GUCCIONE, AND C. VALQUI

Finally we check condition (4), which is equivalent to

δjj ′ A(i, l)kj =Xu

A(i, u)kj ′ A(u, l)kj

for all i, j , j′, k and l.

(3.9)

When t(l) = l, then A(u, l) = δul id for all u, which implies that equality (3.9) holds. Assume
that t(l) 6= l. We consider three cases: i = l, i = t(l) and i /∈ {l, t(l)}. If i = l, then equality (3.9)
reads

δjj ′ A(l, l)kj = A(l, l)kj ′ A(l, l)kj + A(l, t(l))kj ′ A(t(l), l)kj

for all j, j′ and k;

if i = t(l), then equality (3.9) reads

δjj ′ A(t(l), l)kj = A(t(l), l)kj ′ A(l, l)kj + A(t(l), t(l))kj ′ A(t(l), l)kj

for all j, j′ and k;

and ﬁnally, if i /∈ {l, t(l)}, then equality (3.9) reads

0 = A(i, t(l))kj ′ A(t(l), l)kj

for all j, j′ and k.

All these equalities are easily veriﬁed using that, since (c1, . . . , cm) is a coloration,

A(l, l) =(cid:18)al

al

1 − al

1 − al(cid:19) ,

A(t(l), l) =(cid:18)1 − al

−al

al − 1

al (cid:19) ,

and that

- if t(t(l)) = t(l), then A(t(l), t(l)) = id;

1−al al(cid:1);
- if t(t(l)) 6= t(l), then A(t(l), t(l)) =(cid:0) 1−al al
- if t(t(l)) = l, then A(l, t(l)) =(cid:0) al −al
- if t(t(l)) 6= l, then al ∈ {0, 1}, A(t(t(l)), t(l)) = (cid:0) al −al

al−1 1−al(cid:1) and A(u, t(l)) = 0 for all u /∈ {l, t(l)};

al−1 1−al(cid:1) and A(u, t(l)) = 0 for all

u /∈ {t(l), t(t(l))}.

4 Miscellaneous results

Throughout this section χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m denotes a map and λkl
ij , A(i, l) and B(j, k)
are as at the beginning of Section 2. We also assume that A(i, l) and B(j, k) are idempotent
matrices for all i, l ∈ N∗
n. The following results are useful in our quest of classifying
the twisted tensor products K n ⊗χ K m.

m and j, k ∈ N∗

4.1 General properties

Remark 4.1. The rank matrices Γχ and ˜Γχ, introduced in Deﬁnition 2.11, have the same trace.
In fact,

Tr(Γχ) =Xi

rk(A(i, i)) =Xi,j

λji

ij =Xj

rk(B(j, j)) = Tr(˜Γχ).

Remark 4.2. Since the matrices A(i, l) are idempotent, we know that rk(A(i, l)) = Tr(A(i, l)).
Consequently,

rk(A(i, l)) =Xj

A(i, l)jj =Xj

B(j, j)li.

Similarly, rk(B(j, k)) =Pi A(i, i)kj.

4.2 Standard idempotent 0, 1-matrices

Deﬁnition 4.3. A 0, 1-matrix A ∈ Mn(K) is called a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix if there
exist r ∈ N∗
n and a matrix C ∈ Mn−r×r(K) that has exactly one non-zero entry in each row,
such that

A =(cid:18)idr

C 0(cid:19) ,

0

(4.10)

where idr is the identity of Mr(K).

Deﬁnition 4.4. Two matrices A, A′ ∈ Mn(K) are equivalent via identical permutations in rows
and columns if there exists a permutation σ ∈ Sn such that Aσ(k)σ(j) = A′

kj for all k, j.

Remark 4.5. A matrix A ∈ Mn(K) is equivalent via identical permutations in rows and columns
to a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix if and only if it is a 0, 1-matrix with exactly one nonzero
entry in every row, that satisﬁes the following condition: for each j, if Ajj = 0, then Akj = 0 for
all k.

Notation 4.6. Let A ∈ Mn(K) be a 0, 1-matrix such that A1 = 1. For each k such that Akk = 0,
we let ck = ck(A) denote the unique index such that Akck is non-zero.

Proposition 4.7. Let A ∈ Mn(K) be a 0, 1-matrix. If A is idempotent and A1 = 1, then A is
equivalent via identical permutations in rows and columns to a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix.

Proof. Since r := rk(A) = Tr(A), we have r times the entry 1 and n − r times the entry 0 on
the diagonal of A. Applying an identical permutations in rows and columns we can assume that
the 1’s are in the ﬁrst r entries. Since A1 = 1, each row of this matrix has only one 1, and the
other entries are zero. Thus, the ﬁrst r rows of A are as in (4.10). Now the fact that rk(A) = r
implies that, again as in (4.10), the right lower block of A is the zero matrix and its left lower
block is a matrix C that satisﬁes the required properties.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.8. By Proposition 4.7 we have Ackck = 1 for each k such that Akk = 0.

Corollary 4.9. Assume that χ is a twisting map.
If A(l, l) is a 0, 1-matrix, then A(l, l) is
equivalent via identical permutations in rows and columns to a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix.

Proposition 4.10. Assume that χ is a twisting map and let l ∈ N∗

m. If

rk(A(i, l)) rk(A(l, i)) = 0

for all i 6= l,

then A(l, l) is a 0, 1-matrix.

Proof. By Corollary 2.5(4) and the fact that A(i, l)A(l, i) = 0 for all i 6= l,

A(l, l)kj =

mXi=1

A(l, i)kj A(i, l)kj = A(l, l)2

kj.

So, A(l, l)kj ∈ {0, 1} for all k, j.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.11. If χ is a twisting map and Γχ is upper or lower triangular, then each of the
matrices A(l, l) is a 0, 1-matrix.

Remark 4.12. Proposition 4.10 and Corollaries 4.9 and 4.11 are valid for the matrices B(j, j) (in
the second corollary we replace Γχ by ˜Γχ).

More generally, if A ∈ Mn(K) such that A2 = A, A1 = 1 and rk(A) = 1, then there exists

A =(cid:18) a 1 − a
a 1 − a (cid:19) .

Proposition 4.14. If rk(A(i, i)) = 1 for some i ∈ N∗
n such that
˜Γjk 6= 0 for all k. Moreover, if such j is unique, then A(i, i)st = δtj for all s, t. A similar
statement holds for B(j, j) and Γ.

m, then there exists j ∈ N∗

Proof. Since Tr(A(i, i)) = rk(A(i, i)) = 1, there exists j such that A(i, i)jj 6= 0. By Remark 4.13

B(j, k)ii = A(i, i)kj = A(i, i)jj 6= 0,

for all k.

This implies that B(j, k) 6= 0 for all k, and so ˜Γjk 6= 0 for all k. If j is unique, then for each
l 6= j there exists k such that ˜Γlk = 0, and so, again by Remark 4.13, we have

A(i, i)hl = A(i, i)kl = B(l, k)ii = 0

for all h.

The argument for B(j, j) and Γ is the same.

(cid:3)

4.4 Columns of 1’s in Γχ

then Γχ = ˜Γχ is the matrix Jn whose entries are all 1.

Proposition 4.15. Assume that χ is a twisting map and that n = m. If Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (1, 1, . . . , 1),
Proof. By Remark 4.1 and Proposition 2.12(3), we know that Diag(cid:0)˜Γχ) = (1, . . . , 1). In other

words, rk(B(j, j)) = 1 for all j. Assume by contradiction that Γχ 6= Jn. Then by items (1)
and (3) of Corollary 2.5 there exist i, l such that A(i, l) = 0. Hence, by Remark 4.13 the i-th
column of B(j, j) is zero for all j. But then Diag(A(i, i)) = (0, . . . , 0), which, since A(i, i) is
idempotent, implies that A(i, i) = 0, a contradiction. For ˜Γχ proceed in a similar way.
(cid:3)

m. Assume that χ is a twisting map, that Γχ = ˜Γχ is the matrix
Proposition 4.16. Let l ∈ N∗
Jn whose entries are all 1’s, and that there exists k such that A(l, l)kj 6= 0 for all j. Let
vi = (vi1, . . . , vin) ∈ K n \ {0}. If v⊥
Proof. Since rk(A(i, l)) = 1 there exists wi = (wi1, . . . , win) ∈ K n such that A(i, l) = vT
i wi.
Assume by contradiction that there exists k such that vik = 0. Then A(i, l)kj = vikwij = 0 for
all j. By (2.3) this means that B(j, k)li = 0 for all j, and so

i ∈ Im(A(i, l)), then vik 6= 0 for all k.

4.3 Rank 1 idempotent matrices

Remark 4.13. At the beginning of Section 3 we noted that if A ∈ M2(K) satisﬁes A2 = A,
A1 = 1 and rk(A) = 1, then there exists a ∈ K such that

det

 = 0.

(4.11)

On the other hand, By Remark 2.6 we know that (B(1, k), . . . , B(n, k)) is a complete family
of orthogonal idempotent matrices of rank 1. But then, also (B(1, k)T, . . . , B(n, k)T) is. Since
B(j, k)ll = A(l, l)kj 6= 0 implies that the vector (B(j, k)l1, . . . , B(j, k)ln) generates Im(B(j, k)T),
the determinant of (4.11) cannot be zero, a contradiction which concludes the proof.

There exists a unique twisting map ξ : K n ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K n with

proven that

From this it follows immediately that the matrices Aξ(i, l) satisfy condition (4) in Corollary 2.5,
which ﬁnishes the proof of the existence of χ. The uniqueness is clear, so it remains to prove
that K n ⊗ξ K n is isomorphic to Mn(K). By Remark 2.15 for this it suﬃces to prove that for any
l and all k, j there exists i such that A(i, l)jk 6= 0, since then the representation ρl is a surjective
morphism between two algebras of the same dimension, and hence is an isomorphism. So ﬁx l,

k, j. FromPi A(i, l) = id it follows that there exists i such that A(i, l)kk 6= 0. But then

Remark 4.18. The uniqueness part in Theorem 4.17 can be improved. If two twisting maps χ
and ˇχ with Γχ = Γ ˇχ = Jn satisfy Aχ(i, l) = A ˇχ(i, l) for a ﬁxed l and all i, and all the entries of
Aχ(i, l) are non null, then χ = ˇχ. The proof is left to the reader (use (2.3), Proposition 4.15 and
Remark 4.13).

5 Standard and quasi-standard columns

Deﬁnition 5.1. The support of a matrix A ∈ Mn(K) is the set

Supp(A) := {(i, j) ∈ N∗

n × N∗

n : aij 6= 0},

and the support of the k-th row of A is the set Supp(Ak∗) := {j ∈ N : akj 6= 0}.

Deﬁnition 5.2. A family (A(i, l))i,l∈N∗
K m with K n if it satisﬁes conditions (1), (2) and (3) of Corollary 2.5.

m of matrices A(i, l) ∈ Mn(K), is called a pre-twisting of

Throughout this section A = (A(i, l))i,l∈N∗

m

denotes a pre-twisting of K m with K n.

Deﬁnition 5.3. We say that the l0-th column of A is a standard column if

(1) A(l0, l0) is a 0, 1-matrix,
(2) Supp(A(i, l0)) ⊆ Supp(A(l0, l0)) ∪ Supp(id) for all i.

Remark 5.4. Assume that (A(i, l0))i∈N∗
facts hold:

m

is a standard column of A and let k ∈ N∗

n. The following

(1) For each index i, we have A(i, l0)kk ∈ {0, 1}.
(2) A(i, l0)kk = 1 for exactly one i. We let i(k) = i(k, l0) denote this index.
(3) If i 6= i(k) and i 6= l0, then A(i, l0)kj = 0 for all j.
(4) A(i, l0)kj = −1 if and only if i = i(k) 6= l0 and j = ck(A(l0, l0)). Moreover A(i, l0)kj ′ = 0

for all j′ /∈ {k, ck(A(l0, l0))}.

(5) A(i, l0)kj ∈ {1, 0, −1} for all i, k, j, and A(i, l0)kj = 1 implies i = l0 or j = k.

Remark 5.5. From Remark 5.4 it follows that each standard column A(i, l0)i∈N∗
of K m with K n can be obtained in the following way:

m of a pre-twisting

(1) Take a matrix A ∈ Mn(K), which is equivalent via identical permutations in rows and

columns to a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix, and set A(l0, l0) := A.

(2) Set Jl0 := {k ∈ N∗

n : A(l0, l0)kk = 1}.

(4) For i 6= l0 deﬁne A(i, l0) ∈ Mn(K) by

A(i, l0)kj :=

1 if k ∈ Ji and j = k,
−1 if k ∈ Ji and j = ck,

0 otherwise.

Next we generalize the notation introduced in Remark 5.4(2).

Remark 5.6. Let l0 ∈ N∗
i0, which is denoted i(k) = i(k, l0) = i(k, l0, A), such that A(i0, l0)kk = 1. So, A(i, l0)kk = δii0 .

n. If A(i, l0)kk ∈ {0, 1} for all i, then there is a unique index

m and k ∈ N∗

Deﬁnition 5.7. We say that a twisting map χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m is standard if the
columns of Aχ are standard columns. In this case we also say that the twisted tensor product
K n ⊗χ K m is standard.

Proposition 5.8. A twisting map χ is a standard twisting map if and only if the map ˜χ, intro-
duced in Remark 2.2, is.

Proof. By Remark 2.2 we know that A ˜χ = Bχ. Thus, since ˜χ is a twisting map, we only must
check that the l0-th column of Bχ is a standard column for all l0 ∈ N∗
n. Item (1) of Deﬁnition 5.3
is an immediate consequence of Remark 5.4(1). For item (2) it suﬃces to consider the case i 6= l0.
By Remark 5.4(4), we know that Bχ(i, l0)kj ∈ {1, 0, −1} for all j, k and that Bχ(i, l0)kj 6= 1 for
j=1 Bχ(i, l0)kj = 0, this implies that if Bχ(i, l0)kk = 0, then the k-th row vanishes.
Else Bχ(i, l0)kk = 1 and there exists exactly one index j′ such that Bχ(i, l0)kj ′ = −1. It remains
to check that j′ = ck(Bχ(l0, l0)). Using that Bχ(i, l0) is idempotent, we obtain that

j 6= k. SincePm

−1 = Bχ(i, l0)kj ′ =

Bχ(i, l0)kj Bχ(i, l0)jj ′ = Bχ(i, l0)kj ′ − Bχ(i, l0)j ′j ′ = −1 − Bχ(i, l0)j ′j ′ .

Set i0 := i(cid:0)j′, l0, A ˜χ(cid:1). Since Bχ(i0, l0)j ′j ′ = 1 the above equality implies that i 6= i0. Thus,

Bχ(i, l0)kj Bχ(i0, l0)jj ′ = Bχ(i0, l0)kj ′ − Bχ(i0, l0)j ′j ′ = Bχ(i0, l0)kj ′ − 1,

0 =

mXj=1

mXj=1

where the ﬁrst equality holds because Bχ(i, l0)Bχ(i0, l0) = 0. Therefore Bχ(i0, l0)kj ′ = 1, and so
i0 = l0, because j′ 6= k. Hence, j′ = ck(Bχ(l0, l0)), as desired.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.9. Let χ be a standard twisting map and let i 6= l and k 6= j. Then Aχ(i, l)kj = −1 if
and only if Bχ(k, k)li = 1 and Aχ(l, l)kj = 1. In fact, by Remark 5.4(4),

Aχ(i, l)kj = −1 ⇒ Bχ(k, k)li = Aχ(i, l)kk = 1.

Since, by Proposition 5.8 and Remark 2.2 we know that the map ˜χ is a standard twisting map
and A ˜χ = (Bχ(i, l))i,l∈N∗

n , we also have Aχ(l, l)kj = 1. Conversely,

1 = Bχ(k, k)li = Aχ(i, l)kk ⇒ ∃!j such that Aχ(i, l)kj = −1.

So j = ck(Aχ(l, l)).

Theorem 5.10. Let (A(i))i∈N ∗
A(i) ∈ Mn(K) and B(k) ∈ Mm(K), such that, for all i and k,

m and (B(k))k∈N ∗

n be two families of idempotent 0, 1-matrices

(1) A(i)1 = 1 and B(k)1 = 1,
(2) A(i)kk = B(k)ii.

otherwise,

gives the unique standard twisting map

such that Aχ(i, i) = A(i) and Bχ(k, k) = B(k).

χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m,

Proof. The uniqueness holds since the deﬁnition of Aχ is forced. Set Bχ(j, k)li := Aχ(i, l)kj. Note
that Bχ(k, k) = B(k). We must check that conditions (1)–(4) of Proposition 2.3 are fulﬁlled and
that χ is standard. For condition (3) we must verify that

δil =Xj

Aχ(i, l)kj

for all i, l and k.

(5.12)

When i = l this is true by assumption. When i 6= l and B(k)li = 0, we have Aχ(i, l)kj = 0 for
all j, and thus equality (5.12) is true. Finally, when i 6= l and B(k)li = 1, we have Aχ(i, l)kk = 1,
Aχ(i, l)kck = −1 (where ck = ck(A(l))) and Aχ(i, l)kj = 0 for j /∈ {k, ck}, and again equal-
ity (5.12) is true. The proof of condition (4) is similar. Since Bχ(j, k)li = Aχ(i, l)kj, condi-

tions (3) and (4) say thatPi Aχ(i, l) = id andPj Bχ(j, k) = id for all l and for all k. Hence,

by Remark 2.8, in order to check condition (1) it suﬃces to prove that

inequality (5.13) holds it is enough to show that

Fix l ∈ N∗
m. Since the B(k)’s are equivalent, via identical permutations in rows and columns, to
a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrices, we know that for each k there exists a unique i such that

rk(cid:0)Aχ(i, l)(cid:1) ≤ #(cid:8)k : Aχ(i, l)kk = 1(cid:9)

Aχ(i, l)kk = B(k)li = 1. Thus Pi #{k : Aχ(i, l)kk = 1} = n. Consequently, to conclude that
But, for i = l we know that rk(cid:0)Aχ(l, l)(cid:1) = #(cid:8)k : Aχ(l, l)kk = 1(cid:9), because A(l) is an idempotent
it follows that #(cid:8)k : Aχ(i, l)kk = 1(cid:9) is the number of non zero rows of Aχ(i, l), which is greater
than or equal to rk(cid:0)Aχ(i, l)(cid:1). This concludes the proof of condition (1) of Proposition 2.3. The

Aχ(i, l)kk ∈ {0, 1} and Aχ(i, l)kk = 0 implies that Aχ(i, l)kj = 0 for all j,

F0(A, l) := {k ∈ N∗

and for all i, l ∈ N∗

m, we set F (A(i, l)) := {j ∈ N∗

n : A(i, l)jj = 1}.

Remark 5.12. The set F (A(i, l)) was introduced in Notation 2.1, where was denoted Ji(l), but
in some places we prefer to use the longer but more precise notation F (A(i, l)).

Deﬁnition 5.13. We will say that Corollary 2.5(4) is satisﬁed in the l0-th column of A if

A(i, h)kj A(h, l0)kj ′ = δjj ′ A(i, l0)kj

for all i, j, j′ and k.

Proposition 5.14. If the l0-th column of A is a standard column, then Corollary 2.5(4) is

⇐) Fix k ∈ N∗
if and only if

n. If i(k, l0) = l0, then k ∈ F (A(l0, l0)) ⊆ F0(A, l0), and so condition (5.14) holds

A(i, l0)kjδkj ′ = δjj ′ A(i, l0)kj

for all i, j and j′.

But this is true for i 6= l0, since then A(i, l0)kj = 0, and also for i = l0, since A(l0, l0)kj = δkj .

If h0 := i(k, l0) 6= l0, then equality (5.14) holds if and only if

A(i, h0)kj A(h0, l0)kj ′ + A(i, l0)kj A(l0, l0)kj ′ = δjj ′ A(i, l0)kj

(5.15)
since for h /∈ {h0, l0} we have A(h, l0)kj ′ = 0 for all j′. In order to prove that (5.15) is true, we con-
sider the cases j = k, j = ck = ck(A(l0, l0)) and j /∈ {k, ck}. We will use that A(i, h0)kj = δih0 δkj
for all i, j, which is true, because k ∈ F (A(h0, l0)) ⊆ F0(A, h0).

for all i, j and j′,

- If j = k, then we must prove that

A(i, h0)kkA(h0, l0)kj ′ + A(i, l0)kkA(l0, l0)kj ′ = δkj ′ A(i, l0)kk

for all i and all j′.

But this is true, since by the above discussion, Remark 5.4 and Proposition 4.7,

A(i, h0)kk = δih0 , A(h0, l0)kj ′ = δkj ′ − δj ′ck , A(i, l0)kk = δih0 and A(l0, l0)kj ′ = δj ′ck .

- Since A(i, h0)kck = 0 for all i, when j = ck we are reduced to prove that

A(i, l0)kck A(l0, l0)kj ′ = δckj ′ A(i, l0)kck

for all i and all j′.

But this is true, since A(l0, l0)kj ′ = δj ′ck .

- If j /∈ {k, ck}, then both sides of (5.15) vanish.

Thus, (5.14) holds in all the cases.

Corollary 5.15. Let χ : K m⊗K n −→ K n⊗K m be a k-linear map such that Aχ is a pre-twisting.

column of A is a quasi-standard column, then the only entries where the matrix A(i, l0) may
have nonzero values are the entries indicated by stars. In this example and in Example 5.26
below, the elements of each family Ju are consecutive, but of course this need not be the case.

A(i, l0)kj A(i, l0)jck = Xj∈N∗

A(i, l0)kj A(i, l0)jck = A(i, l0)kck 6= 0.

Consequently, there exists v ∈ N∗

Proof. When v = l0 this is clear. So, we can assume that v 6= l0. Let u := i(k, l0). We consider
two cases:
u 6= v) By the very deﬁnition of quasi-standard column and Remark 5.20

and

d(Xk) := {d(v) : v ∈ Xk}.

Supp(cid:0)A(v, l0)k∗(cid:1) ⊆ Supp(cid:0)(Dul0
Hence it suﬃce to prove that Supp(cid:0)(Dul0

(v) )k∗(cid:1) ∪ Supp(cid:0)(Duv

(v) )k∗(cid:1) ⊆ {ck}. Since Dui

(l0) = A(v, l0)A(l0, l0)|Ju×Jl0

= 0.

Supp(cid:0)(Duv

(v))k∗(cid:1) ⊆ d(Xk).

(v) = 0 for i /∈ {v, l0},

Since Dl0l0

(l0) = id, this yields

Dul0

(v) = −Duv

(v)Dvl0
(l0).

Thus, if Supp((Duv

(v))k∗) = ∅, then Supp((Dul0

(v) )k∗) = ∅. Else Supp((Duv

(v))k∗) = {d(v)} and so

Combining this with the fact that

Supp(cid:0)(cid:0)Dvl0
we obtain that Supp(cid:0)(cid:0)Dul0

and A(3, 1) := id −A(1, 1) − A(2, 1) form a quasi-standard column of each pre-twisting of K 3
with K 8 that include them (for instance we can take A(1, 2) = A(3, 2) = A(1, 3) = A(2, 3) = 0
and A(2, 2) = A(3, 3) = id). In this example J1 = {1, 2}, J2 = {3, 4, 5} and J3 = {6, 7, 8}.

Theorem 5.27. Assume that the l0-th column of A is quasi-standard. Then Corollary 2.5(4) is
satisﬁed in the l0-th column of A (that is, condition (5.14) is fulﬁlled) if and only if the following
conditions hold:

(1) Ji = F (A(i, l0)) ⊆ F0(A, i) for all i ∈ N∗

m.

(2) If(cid:0)Duv

(u)(cid:1)kd 6= 0 and u 6= v 6= l0, then

(a) A(u, v)kj = δkj − δjd for all j,
(b) A(v, v)kj = δjd for all j,
(c) A(i, v)kj = 0 for i /∈ {u, v} and for all j.

Proof. ⇒) The arguments given in the proof of Proposition 5.14 show that condition (1) is
fulﬁlled. So we only must prove condition (2). By Deﬁnition 5.17(3)

A(i, l0)kd = 0

for i /∈ {u, v},

which, sincePi A(i, l0) = id and k 6= d, implies that

A(v, l0)kd = −A(u, l0)kd = −(cid:0)Duv

(u)(cid:1)kd 6= 0.

Moreover, by condition (1) we know that k ∈ Ju ⊆ F0(A, u), and so

By (5.16) and (5.18), the equality (5.14) with j′ = d reads

A(i, u)kj = δiuδkj

for all i and j.

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

δiuδkj A(u, l0)kd + A(i, v)kj A(v, l0)kd = δjdA(i, l0)kd

for all i and j.

(5.19)

When i = u, from (5.17) and (5.19), we obtain that

δkj A(u, l0)kd − A(u, v)kj A(u, l0)kd = δjdA(u, l0)kd

for all j,

which gives (a) since A(u, l0)kd 6= 0. On the other hand, when i 6= u, equality (5.19) reduces to

which, combined with (5.16) and (5.17), gives items (b) and (c).

A(i, v)kj A(v, l0)kd = δjdA(i, l0)kd

⇐) By Remark 2.10 it suﬃces to prove that

Xh∈N∗

A(i, h)kj A(h, l0)kj = A(i, l0)kj

for all i, k and j.

(5.20)

Fix k ∈ N∗
n and set u := i(k, l0). If k ∈ F (A(l0, l0)) = F0(A, l0), then A(i, l0)kj = δil0 δkj for all
i and j, and equality (5.20) is trivially true. Consequently we can assume that u 6= l0. So, by
Lemma 5.25,

Thus, if j /∈ {k, ck} ∪ d(Xk) both sides of the equality (5.20) are zero.

Supp(cid:0)A(i, l0)k∗(cid:1) ⊆ {k, ck} ∪ d(Xk)

for all i.

Assume that j = k. By Remark 5.6 equality (5.20) reads

A(i, u)kk = δiu

for all i.

But this is true since, by condition (1), we have k ∈ Ju ⊆ F (A, u).

Suppose now that j = ck. By Remark 5.20, Lemma 5.24 and conditions (1) and (2), equal-

ity (5.20) reduces to

which is true.

A(i, l0)kck A(l0, l0)kck = A(i, l0)kck

for all i,

If j = d(v) for v /∈ {u, l0}, then 0 6= A(h, l0)kd(v) = (Duv

(h))kd(v) implies that h ∈ {u, v}, by
item (3) of Deﬁnition 5.17. But by condition (1) we know that A(i, u)kd(v) = δiuδkd(v) = 0. So
equality (5.20) reduces to

A(i, v)kd(v) A(v, l0)kd(v) = A(i, l0)kd(v) ,

which can be veriﬁed easily using that

A(u, l0)kd(v) =(cid:0)Duv

(u)(cid:1)kd(v) = −(cid:0)Duv

(v)(cid:1)kd(d) = −A(v, l0)kd(v) 6= 0

and condition (2).

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.28. We say that the l0-th column of A has reduced rank r if there are exactly r
indices i 6= l0 such that A(i, l0) 6= 0. In this case we write rrankA(l0) = r. If A is associated with
a map χ as at the beginning of Section 2, then we use rrankχ(l0) as a synonym of rrankA(l0).

Remark 5.29. Let l0, u ∈ N∗
m and let and k ∈ Ju. Assume that A is a family of matrices asso-
ciated with a twisting map of K m with K n and that conditions (1) and (2) of Deﬁnition 5.17
are fulﬁlled for the l0-th column of A. By Remark 5.6 we have A(v, l0)kk = δuv for all v. Conse-
quently, from Corollary 2.5(4) with j′ = k, it follows that

A(i, u)kj = δiuδkj

for all i and j.

(5.21)

Proposition 5.30. Let l0 ∈ N∗
m. Assume that A is a family of matrices associated with a twist-
ing map of K m with K n and that conditions (1) and (2) of Deﬁnition 5.17 are fulﬁlled for the
l0-th column of A.

(a) If condition (3) is also fulﬁlled, then the l0-th column of A is quasi-standard.
(b) If the reduced rank of the l0-th column of A is lower than or equal to 2, then the l0-th

column of A is quasi-standard.

Proof. As in Deﬁnition 5.17, for all i, u, v ∈ N∗

(i) := A(i, l0)|Ju×Jv , where Ji := Ji(l).
(a) We must prove that if condition (3) of Deﬁnition 5.17 is fulﬁlled, then condition (4’) of
Remark 5.21 is also. We begin by proving that

m we set Duv

For u = v = i it is true by Remark 5.19. So, we can assume that u 6= v. Assume on the

contrary that there exist d1 6= d2 in Supp(cid:0)(cid:0)Duv

(v)(cid:1)k∗(cid:1). Since A(i, l0)kd1 = 0 for i /∈ {u, v} and

A(v, l0)kd1 = −A(u, l0)kd1 6= 0, Corollary 2.5(4) with i = u, l = l0 and j = j′ = d1 gives

A similar argument shows that Corollary 2.5(4) with i = u, l = l0, j = d1 and j′ = d2, gives

A(v, v)kd1 − A(v, u)kd1 = 1.

A(v, v)kd1 − A(v, u)kd1 = 0,

(v)(cid:1)k∗(cid:1), then cd = ck. When v = u this follows again

(5.23)

(v) = 0 for i /∈ {v, l0}, this is true if and only if

from Remark 5.19. Assume that v 6= u. We assert that

a contradiction.

It remains to check that if d ∈ Supp(cid:0)(cid:0)Duv
Since Supp(cid:0)(cid:0)Duv

(v)(cid:1)k∗(cid:1) = {d} and Dui

In order to check this, note that A(v, l0)A(l0, l0) = 0 imply

(l0)(cid:1)d∗.

(l0) = 0.

Since Dl0l0

(l0) = id and Supp(cid:0)(cid:0)Duv

Combining this with the fact that

we obtain that Supp(cid:0)(cid:0)Dul0

and i = v gives

By Lemma 5.24, if A(h, l0)kck 6= 0, then h ∈ {u, v, l0}. So Corollary 2.5(4) with j = d, j′ = ck

A(v, l0)kd + A(v, v)kdA(v, l0)kck + A(v, u)kA(u, l0)kck = 0,

where we use that A(l0, l0)kck = 1. But by (5.21) we have A(v, u)kd = δvuδkd = 0, and so,
necessarily A(v, l0)kck 6= 0, which, by equality (5.23), implies ck = cd.
(b) If the reduced rank of the l0-th column of A is lower than 2, then that column is standard
and the result is trivial (see Remark 5.22). So we can assume that its reduced rank is 2. By
item (a) and Remark 5.21 it suﬃces to prove that Duv
(i) = 0, if i 6= l0 and u, v /∈ {i, l0}. Since the
reduced rank of the l0-th column is 2, there exist two indices i0, i1 6= l0 such that A(i, l0) 6= 0 if
and only if i ∈ {l0, i0, i1}. So we must prove that Dibib
(ia) = 0 for a ∈ {0, 1} and b := 1 − a. Take
k ∈ Jib . We ﬁrst prove that either

Supp(A(ib, l0)k∗) ⊆ {k, ck}

or ∃! d such that d ∈ Supp(A(ib, l0)k∗) \ {k, ck}.

(5.24)

Assume by contradiction that there exist d 6= e ∈ Supp(A(ib, l0)k∗) \ {k, ck}. First note that
since A(l0, l0) + A(ia, l0) + A(ib, l0) = id and Supp(A(l0, l0)k∗) = {ck}, if f /∈ {k, ck}, then

A(ia, l0)kf = −A(ib, l0)kf .

(5.25)

By equation (5.21) we know that A(ib, ib)kd = 0. Moreover, since Supp(A(l0, l0)k∗) = {ck}, we
have

A(l0, l0)kd = A(l0, l0)ke = 0.

TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

25

Consequently from Corollary 2.5(4) with j = j′ = d and i = ib, we obtain that

A(ib, ia)kdA(ia, l0)kd =Xu

A(ib, u)kdA(u, l0)kd = A(ib, l0)kd 6= 0,

which implies A(ib, ia)kd 6= 0. On the other hand from Corollary 2.5(4) with j = d, j′ = e and
i = ib, we obtain that

A(ib, ia)kdA(ia, l0)ke =Xu

A(ib, u)kdA(u, l0)ke = 0,

and so, necessarily A(ia, l0)ke = 0. But this is impossible since A(ia, l0)ke = −A(ib, l0)ke 6= 0.
Hence condition (5.24) is satisﬁed. We claim that if it exists, then d ∈ Jia . In fact, since k ∈ Jib
we have A(ia, l0)kk = 0, and thus, by equality (5.25), if d ∈ Supp(A(ib, l0)k∗) \ {k, ck}, then
Supp(A(ia, l0)k∗) = {ck, d}. Using now that A(ia, l0) is idempotent, we obtain that

A(ia, l0)kd = A(ia, l0)k∗A(ia, l0)∗d

= A(ia, l0)kck A(ia, l0)ckd + A(ia, l0)kdA(ia, l0)dd
= A(ia, l0)kdA(ia, l0)dd,

since A(ia, l0)ckd = 0 by Remark 5.18. But then A(ia, l0)dd = 1, which means that d ∈ Jia , as
we claim. Thus

Supp(A(ia, l0)k∗) ⊆ Jl0 ∪ Jia ,

which implies that Supp((Dibib

(ia))k∗) = Supp(A(ia, l0)k∗) ∩ Jib = ∅ for all k ∈ Jib , as desired. (cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.31. We say that a twisting map χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m is quasi-standard if
the columns of Aχ are quasi-standard.

Proposition 5.32. A twisting map χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m is quasi-standard if and only if
the map ˜χ, introduced in Remark 2.2, is a quasi-standard twisting map.

Proof. By Proposition 5.30, Remark 2.2 and the fact that χ is a twisting map if and only if eχ is,

in order to prove the proposition it suﬃces to check that if every column of Aχ is quasi-standard,
then each column of A eχ = Bχ satisﬁes items (1), (2) and (3) of Deﬁnition 5.17. Assume that
each column of Aχ is quasi-standard. Using equality (2.3) it is easy to check that items (1)
and (2) are satisﬁed by the columns of Bχ. Consequently, by Remark 5.21 we only must prove
(where ˜Ju := ˜Ju(k)) are null matrices for j 6= k and u, v /∈ {j, k}. So

(j) := Bχ(j, k)| ˜Ju× ˜Jv

we are reduced to prove that

that eDuv

Bχ(j, k)ls = Aχ(s, l)kj = 0 for all k /∈ {j, u, v}, j /∈ {u, v}, l ∈ ˜Ju and s ∈ ˜Jv.

But, since

l ∈ ˜Ju and s ∈ ˜Jv

if and only if Aχ(l, l)ku = 1 and Aχ(s, s)kv = 1,

and, in that case,

j /∈ {u, v}

if and only if Aχ(l, l)kj = 0 and Aχ(s, s)kj = 0,

for this it suﬃces to check that if k /∈ {j, u, v} and the l-th column of Aχ is quasi-standard, then

Aχ(l, l)ku = 1
Aχ(s, s)kv = 1
Aχ(l, l)kj = 0
Aχ(s, l)kj 6= 0

⇒ Aχ(s, s)kj 6= 0.

Clearly s 6= l. Moreover k ∈ Jw(l) with w 6= s since, otherwise Aχ(s, l)kj = 0 by Theorem 5.27(1).

Suppose that k /∈ Jl(l) and j /∈(cid:8)k, ck(Aχ(l, l))(cid:9). Then, by Lemma 5.25 we have j /∈ Jl(l) ∪ Jw(l).

Consequently, by Deﬁnition 5.17(3) and Remark 5.20,

j ∈ Supp((Dws

(s))k∗) = Supp((Dws

(w))k∗)

and

w 6= s 6= l.

Thus, from Theorem 5.27(2b) we obtain that Aχ(s, s)kj = δjj 6= 0, as desired. So, in order to

Aχ(l, l)ku = 1 implies that Aχ(l, l)kk = 0; j 6= k, because, by Theorem 5.27(1), if j = k, then
(cid:3)

ﬁnish the proof we must check that k /∈ Jl(l) and j /∈ (cid:8)k, ck(Aχ(l, l))(cid:9). But k /∈ Jl, because
Aχ(s, s)kv = δssδkv = 0; and j 6= ck(cid:0)Aχ(l, l)(cid:1), since Aχ(l, l)kj = 0.

follows from (5)(b), (5)(c) and (7); condition (3’), from (5)(c); and condition (4’), from (4)(b),

Now we are going to check that any quasi-standard column of idempotent matrices can be
constructed as above. For this note that applying an identical permutations in rows and columns
we can assume that A(l0, l0) is a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix. Using Proposition 5.16, Defini-

Let χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m be a twisting map and let r < m. By Proposition 1.4 we

know that there exists a twisting map

ˇχ : K r ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K r

such that A ˇχ =(cid:0)Aχ(i, l)(cid:1)1≤i,l≤r if and only if Aχ(i, l) = 0 for all i > r and l ≤ r. Now suppose

that we have a twisting map

ˇχ : K r ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K r.

Let A = (A(i, l))1≤i,l≤m be a pre-twisting which is a extension of the family A ˇχ = (A ˇχ(i, l))1≤i,l≤r
such that

- A(i, l) = 0 if i > r and l ≤ r,
- for l > r, the l-th column of A is a quasi-standard column.

In the following theorem we give necessary and suﬃcient conditions in order that A deﬁnes a
twisting map.

Theorem 5.35. Let A be as above. For all u, v, l ∈ N∗
The family A deﬁnes a twisting map if and only if

(c) A(i, v)kj = 0 for i /∈ {u, v} and for all j.

Proof. The last assertion follows immediately from the deﬁnition of standard column. Next we
prove the main part of the theorem.
⇐) We only must show that condition (4) of Corollary 2.5 is satisﬁed. For l ≤ r this is true since

A(i, h)kj A(h, l)kj ′ =

A(i, h)kjA(h, l)kj ′ = δjj ′ A(i, l)kj ,

because A(h, l) = 0 if h > r and ˇχ is a twisting map; while for l > r this follows from Theorem 5.27
⇒) This follows immediately from Theorem 5.27.

Proposition 5.36. Let A be a pre-twisting of K m with K n. Assume that A(i, i) = id for all
i ∈ N∗
m−1. Then A is the family Aχ of matrices associated with a twisting map χ if and only if

(cid:0)A(l, m)(cid:1)l∈N∗

is a standard column.

Proof. ⇒) By the assumptions it is clear that the rank matrix Γχ introduced in Deﬁnition 2.11
has the form

Γχ =(cid:18)n idm−1

∗

∗(cid:19) ,

(5.26)

Consequently, Γχ satisﬁes the hypothesis of Proposition 4.10 for l = m, and so A(m, m) is a
0, 1-matrix. It remain to check that item (2) of Deﬁnition 5.3 is fulﬁlled for l0 = m, i.e., that

A(k, m)ij 6= 0 ⇒ A(m, m)ij 6= 0

for k < m and i 6= j;

but this follows immediately from the fact that

A(m, m)ij =Xt

A(t, t)ij =Xt

Bχ(j, i)tt = rk((Bχ(j, i))

for all i 6= j,

and Bχ(j, i)mk = A(k, m)ij .
⇐) This follows from Theorem 5.35, since by Remark 5.18 we know that F (A(m, m)) = F0(A, m)
and A(i, i) = idn implies that F0(A, i) = N∗

n for all i < m.

6 Reduced rank 1

In [9] the case of twisting maps χ in which all the columns of Aχ have reduced rank less than or
equal to 1 (see Deﬁnition 5.28) is analysed. In this section we use our tools, that are completely
diﬀerent to the ones used in [9], in order to describe these twisting maps.

Proposition 6.1. Let χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m be a twisting map. Assume that rrankχ(l) = 1
and Aχ(i, l) 6= 0 where i 6= l. The following facts hold:

(1) If Aχ(l, i) = 0, then the l-th column of Aχ is standard. Moreover, if Aχ(l, l)kk = 0, then

Aχ(i, i)kj = δkj for all j.

(2) If Aχ(l, i) 6= 0 and rrankχ(i) = 1, then there is a twisting map ψ : K 2 ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K 2

with Aψ(a, b) := Aχ(f (a), f (b)), where a, b ∈ {1, 2}, f (1) := i and f (2) := l.

Proof. (1) By Proposition 4.10 we know that Aχ(l, l) is a 0, 1-matrix, and clearly

Aχ(l, l) + Aχ(i, l) = id ⇒ Supp(cid:0)Aχ(i, l)(cid:1) ⊆ Supp(cid:0)Aχ(l, l)(cid:1) ∪ Supp(id).

So the l-th column of Aχ is standard. The last assertion follows from Proposition 5.14, since
Aχ(l, l)kk = 0 implies that k ∈ F (Aχ(i, l)).

TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

29

(2) The family of matrices (Aψ(a, b))1≤a,b≤2 satisﬁes the conditions of Corollary 2.5. In fact,
this is clear for the three ﬁrst conditions, whereas the last one follows easily from the fact that

mXh=1

if v ∈ {i, l}.

Aχ(u, h)kjAχ(h, v)kj ′ = Aχ(u, i)kjAχ(i, v)kj ′ + Aχ(u, l)kqAχ(l, v)kj ′ ,

(cid:3)

Proposition 6.2. Let A = (A(i, l))1≤i,l≤m be a pre-twisting of K m with K n. For each l whose
reduced rank is 1, let i(l) denote the unique i(l) 6= l such that A(i(l), l) 6= 0. If rrankA(l) ≤ 1 for
all l, the there exists a twisting map χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m with Aχ = A if and only if for
each l ∈ N∗

m such that rrankA(l) = 1 the following facts hold:

(1) If A(l, i(l)) = 0, then:

(a) A(l, l) is equivalent to a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix via identical permutations

in rows and columns,

(b) A(i(l), i(l))kj = δkj for all j, whenever A(j, j)kk = 0.

(2) If A(l, i(l)) 6= 0, then there is a twisting map ψ : K 2 ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K 2 with Aψ(a, b) :=

Aχ(f (a), f (b)), where a, b ∈ {1, 2}, f (1) := i and f (2) := j.

Proof. The conditions are necessary by Proposition 6.1 and Corollary 4.9. On the other hand, it
is straightforward to check that if A satisﬁes items (1) and (2), then it also fulﬁlls condition (4)
of Corollary 2.5.
(cid:3)

We associate a quiver Qχ with a twisting map χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m in the following
way. The vertices are 1, . . . , m and the adjacency matrix of Qχ is the 0, 1-matrix with 1 in the
entry (i, l) if and only if i 6= l and Aχ(i, l) 6= 0.

Remark 6.3. Proposition 6.2 allows to construct all the twisting maps χ : K m ⊗K n −→ K n ⊗K m
of reduced rank 1 (this means that each column of Aχ has reduced rank lesser than or equal
to 1, and at least one of its columns has reduced rank 1). For this it suﬃces to consider twisting
maps with connected quivers, since every twisting map is the direct sum of the twisting maps
restricted to the connected components. Each connected component of the quiver Qχ has at
most one proper oriented cycle. This follows from the fact that each vertex of the quiver is the
head of at most one arrow from another vertex, since the reduced rank of χ is 1. So, in order
to construct such a twisting map χ take a quiver Q fulﬁlling this condition and ﬁx a connected
component. There are three possible cases: the connected component is a 2-cycle, the connected
component contains no 2-cycle or the connected component contains properly a 2-cycle. The two
ﬁrst cases were treated in [9], and in our setting are very easy to describe: In the ﬁrst one χ is
obtained from a twisting map ψ : K 2 ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K 2, as in Proposition 6.2(2). In the second
one by Proposition 6.1 all columns are standard, so it suﬃces to consider standard twisting maps
compatible with the chosen quiver in the sense that Aχ(i, l) 6= 0 if and only if the adjacency
matrix of Q has 1 in the entry (i, l).

In the third case assume that the 2-cycle is at the vertices i, j. Suppose that there is a reduced
rank 1 twisting map χ such that Qχ = Q. By Proposition 6.1 we know that the l-th columns of
Aχ is standard for all l /∈ {i, j}. This implies that if χ has an arrow from i to l, then F0(Aχ, i) 6= ∅
(and similarly for j). In fact, we have

where inequality holds since A(i, l) = id −A(l, l) and A(l, l) is an idempotent (0, 1)-matrix, while
the inclusion is true by Proposition 5.14. Thus, in order to obtain such a twisting map χ we ﬁrst

∅ 6= F (A(i, l)) ⊆ F0(Aχ, i),

30

J. ARCE, JORGE A. GUCCIONE, JUAN J. GUCCIONE, AND C. VALQUI

construct a twisting map

such that

ψ : K 2 ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K 2,

- Aψ(1, 2) 6= 0 6= Aψ(2, 1),
- F0(Aχ, i) 6= ∅ if Q has an arrow that starts at i and does not end at j,
- F0(Aχ, j) 6= ∅ if Q has an arrow that starts at j and does not end at i.

Then we set Aχ(h, i) := 0 and Aχ(h, j) := 0 for h /∈ {i, j}, and Aχ(f (a), f (b)) := Aψ(a, b), where
f (1) := i and f (2) := j. After that, for each vertex l ∈ Q0 \ {i, j}, we take a standard column
(Aχ(u, l))u∈Q0 such that

- Aχ(u, l) 6= 0 if and only Q has an arrow from u to l,
- F (A(v, l)) ⊆ F0(A, v) for all v ∈ Q0 and l ∈ Q0 \ {i, j}.

By Proposition 5.14, Corollary (4) is satisﬁed for all l /∈ {i, j}. Since an straightforward compu-
tation shows that it is satisﬁed for also for i and j, this method produces all the twisting maps
of reduced rank 1 with quiver Q.

7 Quiver associated with standard and quasi-standard twisting maps

In this section we will construct quivers that characterize completely the standard twisting maps.
Moreover, the quiver indicates how one could possibly generate quasi-standard twisting maps
out of a standard one.

7.1 Characterization of standard twisted tensor products

The aim of this section is to completely characterize the standard twisted tensor products of K n
with K m. In particular we will prove that they are algebras with square zero Jacobson radical.
Our main result generalizes [6, Theorem 4.2]. Let

χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m

be a standard twisting map. As in Remark 2.16, for each j ∈ N∗
fj ⊗ ei . In that remark we saw that

n and i ∈ N∗

m we let xji denote

xkixjl = Aχ(i, l)kjxkl.

xkixjl =

if k /∈ Jl(l), i = i(k, l, A) and j = ck(A(l, l)),
otherwise.

1 if k /∈ Jl(l), i = i(k, l, Aχ) (which means that k ∈ F (Aχ(i, l))) and j = k,

−1 if k /∈ Jl(l), i = i(k, l, Aχ) and j = ck(Aχ(l, l)),

0 otherwise,

TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

Remark 7.2. If j /∈ Jl(l), then

xkixjl = Aχ(i, l)kjxkl = 0 for all k 6= j and all i

and

xjlxki = Bχ(k, j)ilxji = 0 for all i 6= l and all k,

since Aχ(i, l)kj 6= 0 for some i if and only if j = ck(cid:0)Aχ(l, l)(cid:1), B(k, j)il 6= 0 for some k if and only if
l = ci(cid:0)Bχ(j, j)(cid:1), ck(cid:0)Aχ(l, l)(cid:1) belongs to Jl(l) and ci(cid:0)Bχ(j, j)(cid:1) belongs to ˜Jj(j). From these facts
it follows that I :=Lj /∈Jl(l) Kxjl is a square zero two-sided ideal of K n ⊗χ K m. Furthermore,

each two-sided ideal including properly I has an idempotent element xjl, and therefore it is not
a nilpotent ideal. So, I is the Jacobson ideal J(K n ⊗χ K m) of K n ⊗χ K m.

Let χQ be the quiver with set of vertices χQ0 := {(j, i) ∈ N∗

m : j ∈ Ji(i)}, set of arrows
n \ Jl(l)}, and source and target maps s, t : χQ1 −→ χQ0 given

n × N∗

m and j ∈ N∗

χQ1 := {αjl : l ∈ N∗
by

s(αjl) := (j, i(j, l, Aχ)) and t(αjl) := (i(l, j, Bχ), l) = (cj(Aχ(l, l)), l).

Note that s and t are well deﬁned by Proposition 5.14 and Remark 4.8, respectively.

Remark 7.3. By Remarks 4.8 and 5.4(4), Proposition 5.14 and the deﬁnition of χQ, in χQ there
is an arrow from (k, i) to (j, l) if and only if Aχ(i, l)kj = −1.

Now we compute the products xkixjl in terms of the maps s and t. By the computations

made in Remark 7.1, the following facts hold:

(a) If k ∈ Ji(i) and j ∈ Jl(l), then xkixjl =
(b) If k /∈ Ji(i) and j ∈ Jl(l), then xkixjl =(xki
(c) If k ∈ Ji(i) and j /∈ Jl(l), then xkixjl =(xjl

(d) If k /∈ Ji(i) and j /∈ Jl(l), then xkixjl = 0.

otherwise.

if (j, l) = t(αki),

if (k, i) = s(αjl),
otherwise.

Theorem 7.4. The twisted tensor product K n ⊗χ K m is isomorphic to the radical square zero
algebra K χQ/hχQ2
Proof. An algebra morphism from K χQ to K n ⊗χ K m is determined by a coherent choice of
images of the vertices and the arrows of χQ, since K χQ is a tensor algebra on the vertices set
algebra of the arrows bimodule. For each (j, l) ∈ χQ0 set In(j, l) := {αki ∈ χQ1 : (j, l) = t(αki)}.
A straightforward computation using (a)–(d) shows that

xki

if j ∈ Jl(l)

and

φ(αjl) := xjl

if j /∈ Jl(l)

φ((j, l)) := xjl + XIn(j,l)

is a coherent choice and hence deﬁnes an algebra morphism φ : K χQ −→ K n ⊗χ K m. Since
the elements xjl’s generate linearly K n ⊗χ K m, the morphism φ is surjective. Clearly a path
of length two of χQ has zero image. Since both algebras K χQ/hχQ2
1i and K n ⊗χ K m have the
same dimension, the induced map

is an algebra isomorphism, as desired.

The following remark generalizes the correct version of [6, Theorem 4.6].

Remark 7.5. The quiver χQ = (χQ0, χQ1) associated with a standard twisting map χ of K m
with K n fulﬁll the following properties:

m and for all l ∈ N∗

m there exists j ∈ N∗

n such that (j, l) ∈ χQ0,

n × N∗

(1) χQ0 ⊆ N∗
(2) χQ1 = {αjl : (j, l) ∈ (N∗

and t(j, l) = (k, l).

m) \ χQ0},

n × N∗
m) \ χQ0 there exist i ∈ N∗

m and k ∈ N∗

n such that s(j, l) = (j, i)

Conversely if Q = (Q0, Q1) is a quiver that satisﬁes conditions (1), (2) and (3), then there exists
a unique standard twisting map χ of K m with K n, such that Q = χQ. Indeed, by Theorem 5.10
n of
in order to construct χ out of Q it suﬃces to determine families (A(l))l∈N ∗
idempotent 0, 1-matrices A(l) ∈ Mn(K) and B(j) ∈ Mm(K) satisfying conditions (1) and (2) of
that theorem. For this we deﬁne the jth row of A(l) and the lth row of B(j) as follows:

m and (B(j))j∈N ∗

(1) If (j, l) ∈ Q0, then we set A(l)jh := δjh,
(2) if (j, l) /∈ Q0, then we set A(l)jh := δkh, where k is deﬁned by t(j, l) = (k, l),
(3) if (j, l) ∈ Q0, then we set B(j)lh := δlh,
(4) if (j, l) /∈ Q0, then we set B(j)lh := δih, where i is deﬁned by s(j, l) = (j, i).

7.2

Iterative construction of quasi-standard twisted tensor products

The aim of this subsection is to give a method to construct the quasi-standard twisting tensor
products of K m with K n. Through it we use the notations of the previous sections, specially
those introduced in the ﬁfth one. By Theorem 5.10 we can associate in an evident way a
standard twisting map ˆχ to each quasi-standard twisting map χ. This allow us to associate a
quiver χQ := ˆχQ with each quasi-standard twisting tensor product χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m
(Actually it is clear that the deﬁnition of χQ introduced below Remark 7.2 has perfect sense for
a quasi-standard twisting map χ and that χQ = ˆχQ).

Proposition 7.6. Let χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m be a quasi-standard twisting map and let
k, d ∈ N∗
n. Assume that λ := Aχ(u, l)kd 6= 0, or, which is equivalent, that there exist w, v ∈ N∗
m

such that d ∈ Supp(cid:0)(Dwv

(u,l))k∗(cid:1). If Aχ(u, l)kk = 1 and A ˆχ(u, l)kd = 0, then

Aχ(u, l)kd = −Aχ(v, l)kd = Aχ(v, l)kck ,

(7.27)

where ck = ck(Aχ(l, l)). Moreover, there are the following arrows in the quiver of ˆχ:

- αkv, from (k, u) to (d, v),
- αkl, from (k, u) to (ck, l),
- αdl, from (d, v) to (cd, l), (where cd = cd(Aχ(l, l))).

Proof. In order to prove this result it suﬃces to verify that u 6= l, w = u, d /∈ {k, ck} and
v 6= u. In fact, by Lemma 5.25, from the fact that d /∈ {k, ck} it follows that v 6= l, and hence
equalities (7.27) hold by Remark 5.20 and Deﬁnition 5.17(3). Moreover, αkv, αkl and αdl are
arrows of χQ since k /∈ Jv(v) by Theorem 5.27, k /∈ Jl(l) by Theorem 5.27 and the fact that
Aχ(u, l)kd, and d /∈ Jl(l) by Lemma 5.25, and the starting and target vertices of these arrow are
those ones given in the statement because:

- i(k, v, A ˆχ) = u, since A ˆχ(u, v)kk = B ˆχ(k, k)vu = Aχ(u, v)kk = 1,

- ck(cid:0)A ˆχ(v, v)(cid:1) = d, since A ˆχ(v, v)kd = Aχ(v, v)kd = 1,

- i(k, l, A ˆχ) = u, since A ˆχ(u, l)kk = Bχ(k, k)lu = Aχ(u, l)kk = 1,

TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

33

- i(d, l, A ˆχ) = v, since A ˆχ(v, l)dd = Bχ(d, d)lv = Aχ(v, l)dd = 1,

- ck(cid:0)A ˆχ(l, l)(cid:1) = ck, since A ˆχ(l, l) = Aχ(l, l),
- cd(cid:0)A ˆχ(l, l)(cid:1) = cd, since A ˆχ(l, l) = Aχ(l, l),

where in the ﬁrst and second item the last equality hold by Theorem 5.27.

So, we are reduced to prove that the facts pointed out at the beginning of the proof are true.

But u 6= l, because otherwise

Aχ(l, l)kd = δkd ⇒ d = k ⇒ A ˆχ(l, l)kd = Aχ(l, l)kk = 1,

which contradicts A ˆχ(u, l)kd = 0; the equality Aχ(u, l)kk = 1 say that w = u; the equalities

A ˆχ(u, l)kk = 1

and A ˆχ(u, l)kck = −1

imply that d /∈ {k, ck} because A ˆχ(u, l)kd = 0; and by Remark 5.19 we have u 6= v.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 7.7. Let χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m be a quasi-standard twisting map, u, v, l ∈ N∗
k ∈ Ju(u) and d ∈ Jv(v). Assume that there are the following arrows in the quiver of ˆχ:

m,

- αkv, from (k, u) to (d, v),
- αkl, from (k, u) to (ck, l) (where ck = ck(Aχ(l, l))),
- αdl, from (d, v) to (cd, l) (where cd = cd(Aχ(l, l))).

If Supp(cid:0)Duv

(u,l)(cid:1) = ∅, then for each λ ∈ K we deﬁne the map χ1 : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m, by

Aχ1
Aχ1
Aχ1
Aχ1
Aχ1

(u, l)kd := λ,
(v, l)kd := −λ,
(v, l)kck := λ,
(u, l)kck := Aχ(u, l)kck − λ,
(i, t)js

:= Aχ(i, t)js

if (i, t, j, s) /∈ {(u, l, k, d), (v, l, k, d), (v, l, k, ck), (u, l, k, ck)}.

If necessary to be more precise the map χ1 will be denoted by Λλ

(k,u),(d,v),(ck,l)(χ).

Remark 7.8. Note that if λ = 0, then χ1 = χ.

Remark 7.9. By Remark 7.3, if the twisting map χ satisﬁes the assumptions made in Deﬁni-
tion 7.7, then A ˆχ(u, l)kck = −1, which by Remark 5.9 implies that Aχ1
(u, l)kk = A ˆχ(u, l)kk = 1.
Moreover, by the very deﬁnition of χQ, the existence of the arrows αkv, αkl and αdl implies that
u, v and l are three diﬀerent elements of N∗
m. Since k ∈ Ju(u) \ (Jv(v) ∪ Jl(l)), ck ∈ Jl(l) and
d ∈ Jv(v) \ Jl(l), from this fact it follows that k, ck and d are three diﬀerent elements of N∗
n,
which implies that A ˆχ(u, l)kd = 0, because Supp(A ˆχ(u, l)k∗) = {k, ck}. So, the hypothesis of
Proposition 7.6 are satisﬁed by χ1 , provided that it is a quasi-standard twisting map.

Remark 7.10. Assume that the twisting map χ satisﬁes the assumptions made in Deﬁnition 7.7.
If χ1 is a (quasi-standard) twisting map, then Γχ1

= Γχ and ˜Γχ1

= ˜Γχ.

Proposition 7.11. Let χ, χ1, u, v, l, k, d, αkv, αkl, αkd and λ be as in Deﬁnition 7.7. Assume
that λ 6= 0. If χ1 is a quasi-standard twisting map, then

(1) Aχ1
(2) Aχ1

(i, u)kj = A ˆχ(i, u)kj and Aχ1
(u, l), Aχ1

(v, l), Bχ1

(d, k) and Bχ1

(i, v)kj = A ˆχ(i, v)kj for all i, j,

(ck, k) are idempotent matrices.

Moreover, condition (2) implies that χ1 is a (quasi-standard) twisting map.

Proof. By Remark 7.9 we know that Aχ1

(u, l)kk = Aχ(u, l)kk = 1, and so, by Theorem 5.27(1),

Aχ1
On the other hand, since Aχ1

(i, u)kj = δiuδkj = A ˆχ(i, u)kj

for all i, j.

(u, l)kd 6= 0, by Theorem 5.27(2) we have

Aχ1

(i, v)kj =

δkj − δjd

if i = u,
if i=v,
otherwise,

and a direct computation using Theorem 5.10 shows that A ˆχ(i, v)kj is given by the same formula
(for this computation is can be useful to see the proof of Proposition 7.6). This ﬁnishes the proof
of condition (1). By items (1) and (2) of Proposition 2.3, condition (2) is also satisﬁed. Finally,
(i, l) = idK n

by Remark 2.9 condition (2) is suﬃcient for χ1 to be a twisting map, sincePi Aχ1

Corollary 7.12. Under the assumptions made in Deﬁnition 7.7, if χ is standard, then χ1 is a

Remark 7.13. A straightforward computation shows that if χ1 of Deﬁnition 7.7 is a twisting
map, then the construction χ1 out of χ corresponds to a formal deformation in the sense of
Gerstenhaber. To be more precise, the multiplication map µχ1

(ck, k) are idempotent matrices.

of χ1 is given by

(u, l), Aχ1

(v, l), Bχ1

(d, k) and Bχ1

where µ0 is the multiplication in D := K n ⊗χ K m and µ1 : D ⊗ D −→ D is the map deﬁned by

µχ1

(a ⊗ b) = µ0(a ⊗ b) + λµ1(a ⊗ b),

µ1(xku ⊗ xdl) = 1
µ1(xkv ⊗ xckl) = 1
µ1(xkv ⊗ xdl ) = −1
µ1(xku ⊗ xckl) = −1

and

µ1(xpq ⊗ xrs ) = 0

if (xpq, xrs) /∈ {(xku, xdl), (xkv , xdl), (xku, xckl), (xkv, xckl)}.

Remark 7.14. Each quasi-standard twisting map can be obtained from a standard twisting map
by applying repeatedly the construction of Deﬁnition 7.7, thus adding parameters λ1, λ2, λ3, . . . ,
obtaining quasi-standard twisting maps χ1 , χ2, χ3, . . . .
Remark 7.15. Let χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m be a quasi-standard twisting map. For each
u, l, v ∈ N∗
m, k ∈ Ju(u),
d ∈ Jv(v) and Aχ(u, l)kd 6= 0, the quiver of ˆχ has a triangle with vertices (k, u), (d, v) and (ck, l),
and arrows αkv, αkl and αdl, from (k, u) to (d, v), (k, u) to (ck, l), and (d, v) to (ck, l), respectively.
In fact, this follows from the previous results and the fact that ck = cd by Deﬁnition 5.17(4).

7.3 Jacobson radical of quasi-standard twisted tensor products

Let χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m be a quasi-standard twisting map. For each j ∈ N∗
n and l ∈ N∗
m,
let xjl be as in Remark 2.16. In this subsection we prove that, as in the case when χ is standard,

the Jacobson ideal J(C) of C := K n ⊗χ K m is the ideal I :=Lj /∈Jl(l) Kxjl of C (however unlike

what happens in the standard case, when χ is not standard I can be not a square zero ideal).
As a consequence there exists a subalgebra A ≃ C

J(C) of C such that C = AL J(C).

Theorem 7.16. Let χ, C and I be as above. Then I is the Jacobson ideal of C.

Proof. For each j, k ∈ N∗

n and i, l ∈ N∗

m. If i 6= l or k 6= j, then

xkixjl = Aχ(i, l)kjxkl ∈ I.

In fact, if k /∈ Jl(l), then this is true by the very deﬁnition of I, and if k ∈ Jl(l), then it is true
because Aχ(i, l)kj = 0 by Theorem 5.27(1). So, I is a two-sided ideal of C. To ﬁnish the proof
it suﬃces to show that

xj1l1 · · · xjn+1ln+1 = 0

for each xj1l1 , . . . , xjn+1ln+1 ∈ I.

By the above argument this is true if there exist s < t such that js ∈ Jlt (lt). So, assume that
this is not the case. Then, since j1, . . . , jn+1 ∈ N∗

n there exist u < v such that ju = jv, and so

xjulu · · · xjv lv =

Aχ(lu+h, lu+h+1)juju+h+1 xjulv = 0,

v−u−1Yh=0

because Aχ(lv−1, lv)jujv = 0 by the fact that ju /∈ Jlv−1 (lv−1) and Theorem 5.27(1).

Corollary 7.17. Under the hypothesis of Theorem7.16, the quotient algebra C

to the direct product Qj∈Jl(l) Kxjl of ﬁelds, and there exists a subalgebra A ≃ C
that C = AL J(C).

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows from the fact that for each i, l ∈ N∗
with j 6= k,

J(C) is isomorphic
J(C) of C such

m, k ∈ Ji(i) and j ∈ Jl(l),

and

xjlxjl = A(l, l)jj xjl = xjl,
xkixjl = A(i, l)kj xkl ∈ I if k /∈ Jl(l)

xkixjl = A(i, l)kj xkl = 0 if k ∈ Jl(l).

The second assertion follows now by a direct application of the Principal Theorem of Wedderburn-
Malcev ([16, Chapter 11]).
(cid:3)

Remark 7.18. It is easy to check that if χ : K m ⊗ K n −→ K n ⊗ K m is a quasi-standard twisting
map that it is not standard, then J(C)2 6= 0.

8 Low dimensional cases

In this section we determine the twisting maps of K 3 with K 3. To achieve this it is convenient
ﬁrst to describe in detail the twisting maps of K 2 with K 2 and the twisting map of K 2 with K 3.

8.1 Twisting maps of K 2 with K 2

We ﬁrst use our results to obtain a classiﬁcation of all twisting maps χ : K 2 ⊗ K 2 −→ K 2 ⊗
K 2 in a direct way. This classiﬁcation was already obtained by [12]. By Corollary 2.12 and
Proposition 2.13 we can assume that the Aχ-rank matrix is one of the following:

Γ1 =(cid:18)2

0

0

2(cid:19) , Γ2 =(cid:18)2 1

0 1(cid:19) or Γ3 =(cid:18)1 1
1 1(cid:19) .

First case If the Aχ-rank matrix is Γ1, then A(1, 1) = A(2, 2) = id. Consequently χ is the ﬂip
and K 2 ⊗χ K 2 ∼= K 4.

36

J. ARCE, JORGE A. GUCCIONE, JUAN J. GUCCIONE, AND C. VALQUI

Second case If the Aχ-rank matrix is Γ2, then χ is a standard twisting map (use Proposi-
tion 4.10), and one veriﬁes readily that χ is equivalent via identical permutations in rows and
columns to the twisting map χ′ with quiver

(1, 1)

(1, 2)

χ′

Q =

α22

.

(2, 1)

(2, 2)

Here the bullets represent the vertices of χ′
Q, and the white circle in the coordinate (2, 2),
indicates that the arrow α22 starts at the 2-th row and ends at the 2-th column. It is easy to
recover the matrices of Aχ′ from χ′

Q. We have:

A(1, 1) = id, A(2, 1) = 0, A(2, 2) =(cid:18)1

1

0

0(cid:19) and A(1, 2) =(cid:18) 0

−1 1(cid:19) .

0

In the sequel we will simply represent the quivers of this twisting map and of its equivalent
twisting maps as

where there is a bullet in the position (j, i) if (j,i) is a vertex (thus j ∈ Ji(i)); and there is a
white circle in the position (j, l) if the quiver has an arrow αjl that starts at the j-th row and
ends at the l-th column (it is unique). The quivers associated with standard twisting maps of
K 3 with K 2 and of K 3 with K 3 will be represented by diagrams constructed following the same
instructions.

Third case If the Aχ-rank matrix is Γ3, then by Remark 3.1, there exist a, a′ ∈ K, such that

Aχ(2, 1) =(cid:18)1 − a a − 1
a (cid:19) ,
Aχ(2, 2) =(cid:18)a′
1 − a′(cid:19) .

Aχ(1, 1) =(cid:18)a 1 − a
a 1 − a(cid:19) ,
Aχ(1, 2) =(cid:18)1 − a′ a′ − 1
a′ (cid:19) ,
Thus, by (2.3) we have Bχ(1, 1) =(cid:16) a
1−a′ a′ (cid:17). Therefore a′ = 1 − a by Proposition 4.15 and
Aχ(1, 1) =(cid:18)a 1 − a
a 1 − a(cid:19) ,
Aχ(1, 2) =(cid:18) a
a − 1 1 − a(cid:19) ,

Aχ(2, 1) =(cid:18)1 − a a − 1
a (cid:19) ,
Aχ(2, 2) =(cid:18)1 − a a
1 − a a(cid:19) .

Remark 3.1, and so

1 − a′

−a′

−a

−a

−a

a′

1−a

Now a direct computation using (2.3) shows that Bχ(i, j) = Aχ(i, j) for i, j = 1, 2, which enables
one to check easily that the conditions of Proposition 2.3 are satisﬁed. Hence we have a family
of twisting maps parameterized by a ∈ K. Applying Proposition 2.13 we see that the twisting
maps corresponding to a and 1 − a are isomorphic. Moreover, using again the same proposition,
we check that these are the only isomorphisms between these twisting maps. If a ∈ {0, 1}, then
the twisting map is standard and the quiver is one of

or

.

TWISTED TENSOR PRODUCTS OF K n WITH Km

On the other hand, by Proposition 2.14 and Remark 2.15 we know that for a /∈ {0, 1}, the map
ρ1 : K 2 ⊗χ K 2 −→ M2(K), given by

ρ1(fj ⊗ 1) := Ejj

and ρ1(1 ⊗ ei) := A(i, 1),

is an algebra isomorphism. So we obtain in this case, modulo isomorphism, four diﬀerent algebras.

8.2 Twisting maps of K 3 with K 2

Now we use our results to classify all the twisting maps χ of K 3 with K 2 (By Remark 2.2, Propo-
sition 5.8 and Proposition 5.32, this immediately gives a similar classiﬁcation for the twisting
maps of K 2 with K 3). By Corollary 2.12 and Proposition 2.13 we can assume that the Aχ-rank
matrix is one of the following:

Γ1 =

2

By Proposition 4.10, except perhaps in the cases Γ5 and Γ6, the matrices Aχ(l, l) are 0, 1-matrices,
which (since the reduced rank of χ is less than or equal to 1) implies that χ is a standard twisting
map. So we list all the possible standard twisting maps (for this we use the method given in
Remark 7.5):

If Γχ = Γ5, then χ is a direct sum of two twisting maps, and the twisted tensor product algebra

is isomorphic to K 2 ⊕ A, where A is a twisted tensor product K 2 ⊗χ′ K 2 with Γχ′ = ( 1 1

either it is standard (recovering the case #5 in the list), or it corresponds to a value of a /∈ {0, 1}
in the third case of Subsection 8.1, and we obtain an algebra isomorphic to K 2 ⊕ M2(K).

If Γχ = Γ6, then by Proposition 4.10 the ﬁrst column of Aχ is a standard column, so that

1 0 ) and Aχ(3, 1) =(cid:0) 0 0

either Aχ(1, 1) = ( 1 0
Proposition 2.13 we can assume, and we do it, that Aχ(1, 1) = ( 1 0
1 0 )). Moreover, by Proposi-
tion 1.4 the matrices Aχ(i, j) for i, j ∈ {2, 3} deﬁne a 2 times 2 twisting map χ′ with Γχ′ = ( 1 1
1 1 ),
which is either standard, or has 1 − a, a /∈ {0, 1} on the diagonal of Aχ′ (3, 3) = Aχ(3, 3). But
Theorem 5.35 shows that

0 1 ) and Aχ(3, 1) =(cid:0) 1 −1

{2} = F (A(3, 1)) ⊆ F0(A, 3).

So A(3, 3)22 = 1 and the twisting map is standard, corresponding to the sixth case on the list.

If Γχ = Γ7, then the twisting map should be standard, but no standard twisting map χ yields

Γχ = Γ7, so there is no twisting map in this case.

8.3 Twisting maps of K 3 with K 3

We next aim is to construct (up to isomorphisms) all the twisting maps of K 3 with K 3. Since
in the appendix we list all standard and quasi-standard twisting maps of K 3 with K 3, for this
purpose in this section we only need construct the twisting maps that are not quasi-standard.
In order to carry out this task in addition to the previous results, we will use the following ones:

Remark 8.1. Let A = (A(i, l))i,l∈N∗
has reduced rank 1 and A(l, l) is a 0, 1-matrix, then the l-th column of A is standard.

Proposition 8.2. Let χ : K m ⊗ K 3 −→ K 3 ⊗ K m be a twisting map and let i1, i2 and i3 be
three diﬀerent elements of N∗
m such that Aχ(i2, i1) 6= 0 6= Aχ(i3, i1) and Aχ(i1, i1) is equivalent
to the matrix

via identical permutations in rows and columns. If the i1-th column of Aχ is not quasi-standard,
then the following facts hold:

(1) Aχ(i2, i3) 6= 0 6= Aχ(i3, i2) and neither the i2-th nor the i3-th column of Aχ are quasi-

standard columns.

(2) If Aχ(i1, i1) =(cid:16) 1 0 0

1 0 0(cid:17), then

Aχ(i3, i1)22 = Aχ(i3, i2)22 = Aχ(i3, i3)22,

and there exist z ∈ K × and α ∈ K × \ {1} such that

where the ∗’s denote arbitrary elements of K. Moreover, by Proposition 5.30(2) we know that
α /∈ {0, 1}. Let z := Aχ(3, 1)23. Since the sum of the entries of each row of Aχ(2, 1) and Aχ(3, 1)

Furthermore, since lower triangular idempotent matrices have 0 or 1 in each diagonal entry,

necessarily z 6= 0. Now it is clear that, since rk(cid:0)Aχ(2, 1)(cid:1) = rk(cid:0)Aχ(3, 1)(cid:1) = 1, both matrices

have the desired form. But then the ﬁrst row of Bχ(2, 2) is (0, α, 1 − α, 0, . . . , 0), the ﬁrst row of
Bχ(1, 2) is (1, −(α + z), (α + z) − 1, 0, . . ., 0) and the ﬁrst row of Bχ(3, 2) is (0, z, −z, 0, . . . , 0). An
easy computation using these facts, that by Remark 2.6 we have B(1, 2)+ B(2, 2)+ B(3, 2) = id3,
and that Proposition 2.3(2) the columns of B(2, 2) are orthogonal to the ﬁrst rows of B(1, 2) and
B(3, 2), shows that

Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume that Aχ(i, 1) = 0 for i > 3 and that i1 = 1,
i2 = 2 and i3 = 3. By items (1) and (3) of Corollary 2.5 we know that Aχ(1, 1)Aχ(i, 1) = 0 for
all i > 1 and that Aχ(1, 1) + Aχ(2, 1) + Aχ(3, 1) = id3. Hence there exists α ∈ K such that

which ﬁnishes the proof of item (2) via (2.3).

Item (1) follows from the fact that A(3, 2)22 = 1 − α /∈ {0, 1} and A(2, 3)22 = α /∈ {0, 1}. (cid:3)

Our next aim is to determine up to isomorphisms all twisting maps χ : K 3 ⊗ K 3 −→ K 3 ⊗ K 3
which are not quasi-standard. For this, we can and we will assume that the values of the diagonal
of Γχ are non increasing. So in the rest of this subsection χ denotes an arbitrary twisting map
satisfying this restriction and we look for conditions in order that χ be not quasi-standard. We

organize our search according to the values ofP Tr :=Pi Tr(Aχ(i, i)) =Pj Tr(Bχ(j, j)).

Here the values of the diagonal of Γχ may be (3, 3, 3), (3, 3, 2), (3, 3, 1) or (3, 2, 2). By Proposi-

equivalent via identical permutations in rows and columns to one of the following matrices:

By Proposition 4.10 in the two ﬁrst cases the diagonal matrices are 0, 1-matrices, and so by
Remark 8.1 the obtained twisting maps are standard. In the last one χ is a direct sum of the
ﬂip of K with K 3 and a twisting map χ′ : K 2 ⊗ K 3 −→ K 3 ⊗ K 2. Moreover, the analysis made
out in Subsection 8.2 shows that if χ′ is not quasi-standard, then K 3 ⊗χ′ K 2 is isomorphic to
K 2 × M2(K). Thus, in this case K 3 ⊗χ K 3 ≃ K 5 × M2(K).

The diagonal of Γχ is either (2, 2, 2) or (3, 2, 1). We treat each case separately:

Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (2, 2, 2)
Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (2, 2, 2) By Proposition 2.13 we can assume that the ﬁrst column is (2, 1, 0)⊥, or,

in other words, that Γχ it is one of the following matrices:

Moreover, by Proposition 4.10 and Remark 8.1, each twisting map whose rank matrix is the last
one is standard, and, again by Proposition 2.13, each twisting map whose rank matrix is the ﬁrst

Since, by Proposition 4.10 and Remark 8.1, the ﬁrst column is standard, the hypothesis of
Theorem 5.35 are satisﬁed. By this theorem and Proposition 1.4, we know that χ is twisting
map if and only if the ﬁrst column of Aχ is standard and the matrices Aχ(2, 2), Aχ(3, 2), Aχ(3, 3)
and Aχ(2, 3) deﬁne a twisting map of K 2 with K 3 such that F (Aχ(2, 1)) ⊆ F0(Aχ, 2) (In fact,
we also need that F (A(i, 1)) ⊆ F0(A, i) for i ∈ {1, 3}, but for i = 3 this is trivial and for i = 1

In both cases setting Aχ(1, 1) := id3 −Aχ(2, 1), Aχ(3, 1) = 0, Aχ(1, 2) = 0 and Aχ(1, 3) = 0
(which is forced), we obtain a twisting map which is not quasi-standard. In the ﬁrst one

Taking into account Proposition 5.32, and applying the same arguments to ˜χ, we conclude that

χ is a non quasi-standard twisting map with Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (2, 2, 2) if and only if ˜χ is.

Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (3, 2, 1)
Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (3, 2, 1) Assume that χ is a not quasi-standard twisting map. Then, by the last
Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (3, 2, 1)
assertion we know that Diag(cid:0)˜Γχ(cid:1) = (3, 2, 1). The rank matrix Γχ is one of the following matrices:

By Proposition 4.14, both Γχ and ˜Γχ = Γ ˜χ must be one of the last two matrices. But by
Corollary 4.11, Proposition 5.8 and Remark 8.1, if Γχ or ˜Γχ is the last matrix, then χ is a
standard twisting map. So the only chance of being not standard for the twisting map χ is that
both Γχ and ˜Γχ be the second last matrix. In that case by Propositions 4.10 and 5.30(2) we
recover the family of quasi-standard twisting maps listed in number 20 in the appendix.

Since ˜Γ has at least one 1 in the diagonal, By Proposition 4.14 the rank matrix Γχ can not be
the ﬁrst of the second row. Assume ﬁrst that

(8.29)

and that the twisting map χ is not standard. So, χ is an extension of a twisting map χ′ of K 2
with K 3. Clearly, if the third column of Aχ is quasi-standard, then χ′ must be a non quasi-
standard twisting map. But by Proposition 8.2(1) this is also the case if the third column of Aχ
is quasi-standard. Thus, by the analysis made out in subsection 8.2, we can assume that there
exists a ∈ K \ {0, 1}, such that

If the third column of Aχ is quasi-standard, then by Theorem 5.35, we have

a contradiction. Hence it is not quasi-standard. Moreover, by Proposition 4.10 necessarily
Aχ(3, 3) is one of the following matrices:

In the two last cases a straightforward computation using Propositions 2.13 and 8.2(2) leads to
the contradiction A(1, 2)11 6= 0. Hence Aχ(3, 3) is the ﬁrst matrix. Now applying Proposition 8.2,
we obtain a family of not quasi-standard twisting maps parameterized by α ∈ K \ {0, 1} and
z ∈ K ×. Moreover, we have

˜Γχ =

If Γχ is not the matrix at the right side of equality (8.29) , then ˜Γχ can not be that matrix
because Γχ would be the matrix at the right side of equality (8.31). But all the other possible
matrices for ˜Γχ (including those with diagonal (3, 1, 1)) have exactly one row without zeroes,
and so, by Propositions 4.14 and 2.13 we can assume that Aχ(3, 3) is the ﬁrst matrix in (8.30).
By Proposition 8.2, if

then χ must be quasi-standard. In fact, otherwise it is an extension of a not quasi-standard
twisting map of K 3 with K 2, and we know that in this case #F0(Aχ, 2) = 1, which contradict
the fact that #F (Aχ(2, 3)) = 2 and F (Aχ(2, 3)) ⊆ F0(Aχ, 2) by Theorem 5.35. Finally, if

then χ must be a standard twisting map, since the ﬁrst column is standard and it is the extension
of a standard twisting map of K 3 with K 2 (which follows from Proposition 5.8 and the analysis
made out in Subsection 8.2).

Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (3, 1, 1)

By Proposition 4.10, if Γχ is the ﬁrst matrix, then χ is a standard twisting map. Assume that Γχ
is not the ﬁrst matrix, which by Propositions 4.14 implies that ˜Γχ has one row without zeroes.
By the arguments given above, if Γχ is not the last matrix, then ˜Γχ can not be equivalent via
identical permutations in rows and columns to the ﬁrst matrix in the second row of (8.28).
Hence, ˜Γχ has exactly one row without zeroes, and by Propositions 4.14 and 8.2, if χ is not
quasi-standard, then Aχ(2, 1) 6= 0 6= Aχ(1, 2). So, necessarily χ is quasi-standard, and in fact
there is quasi-standard twisting maps with Γχ the ﬁfth matrix (see the appendix). But if Γχ

is the second, third or fourth matrix, then condition (1) in Theorem 5.35 is not fulﬁlled, and
thus there is not twisting maps in these cases. Finally, there is a family of not quasi-standard
twisting maps χ with Γχ the last matrix, dual to the family found above, when analyzing the

case Diag(cid:0)Γχ(cid:1) = (2, 2, 1).
8.3.4 PPP Tr =4

We claim that in this case all twisting maps are quasi-standard. By Proposition 2.13 in order to
prove this it suﬃces to check that χ is quasi-standard if its rank matrix Γχ is one of the following

If Γχ is the ﬁrst or the third matrix of the ﬁrst row, then χ is a extension of a standard twisting
map χ′ of K 2 with K 3, whose added column is standard, and so it is standard. If Γχ is the second
matrix of the second row, then χ is an extension of a standard twisting map of K 2 with K 3.
Moreover, by Proposition 4.10 we know that Aχ(3, 3) is equivalent via identical permutations
in rows and columns to a standard idempotent (0, 1)-matrix, and hence, by proposition 8.2, the
twisting map χ is quasi-standard. By Proposition 4.14, the rank matrix Γχ can not be the second
matrix in the ﬁrst row. Also Γχ can not be the ﬁrst matrix in the second row, because otherwise
it would be the extension of a twisting map χ′ of K 2 with K 3 with Γχ′ = ( 1 2
is impossible. So, we are left with the last four matrices. Assume ﬁrst that Γχ is the last one.
By Proposition 2.13 we also can assume that Diag(Γ ˜χ) = (2, 1, 1). In this case Bχ(2, 1) = 0 or
Bχ(3, 1) = 0, both cases being equivalent via Proposition 2.4 with σ = id and τ = (2, 3). So,
assume that Bχ(2, 1) = 0, which by Remark 4.13 implies that

where for the last equality we use once more Remark 4.13. Since rk(Aχ(3, 2)) = 1 it follows that
Diag(Aχ(3, 2)) = (1, 0, 0), and therefore

Now, from Proposition 8.2(1) it follows that χ is quasi-standard. For the remaining three cases,
the only way that χ can be not quasi-standard is that ˜Γχ = Γ ˜χ has exactly one row without
zeroes. But then Propositions 4.14 and 8.2 shows that the twisting map χ is quasi-standard.

8.3.5 PPP Tr =3

By Proposition 4.15 we know that Γχ = ˜Γχ = J3. We have the following possibilities for each
matrix Aχ(i, i) and each Bχ(j, j).
It is equivalent to a standard idempotent 0, 1-matrix via
identical permutations in rows and columns, it has all entries non-zero, or it has two non-zero
columns and one zero column. If two of Aχ(1, 1), Aχ(2, 2) and Aχ(3, 3) are 0, 1-matrices, then all
the matrices Bχ(j, k) have zeroes and ones in its diagonal entries, and, moreover, by Remark 4.13
each Bχ(j, j) is a (0, 1)-matrix. Therefore the hypothesis of Proposition 5.30 are fulﬁlled, and
we have a quasi-standard twisting map. On the other hand, if one of the Aχ(i, i) (say Aχ(1, 1))
has all its entries non-zero, then χ is a non quasi-standard twisting map which yields a tensor
product algebra isomorphic to M3(K).
In fact, the existence follows from Proposition 4.16
and Theorem 4.17 (with v2 and v3 vectors that generate the images of Aχ(2, 1) and Aχ(3, 1),
respectively), and the uniqueness follows from Remark 4.18). So there are two cases left:

- All three matrices Aχ(1, 1), Aχ(2, 2) and Aχ(3, 3) have exactly one zero column.
- One of them (for example Aχ(1, 1)) is a 0, 1-matrix, the other two have exactly one zero

column.

In the ﬁrst case a straightforward computation shows that the resulting twisting map (up to an
isomorphism) is given by

Appendix: Quasi-standard twisting maps of K 3 with K 3

Next we list the quasi-standard twisting maps of K 3 with K 3. For this, ﬁrst we construct the
standard ones using the method given in Remark 7.5, and then we construct the remaining
quasi-standard twisting maps using the recursive method developed in Subsection 7.2. Is not
possible iterate arbitrarily the steps in this construction because the conditions in item (2) of
Proposition 7.11 would not be satisﬁed (see for instance the last item in following list).
