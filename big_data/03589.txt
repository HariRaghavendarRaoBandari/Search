We demonstrate the violation of an EPR steering inequality developed for single photon path
entanglement with displacement-based detection. We use a high-rate source of heralded single-photon
path-entangled states, combined with high-eﬃciency superconducting-based detectors, in a scheme
that is free of any post-selection and thus immune to the detection loophole. This result conclusively
demonstrates single-photon entanglement in a one-sided device-independent scenario, and opens the
way towards implementations of device-independent quantum technologies within the paradigm of
path entanglement.

Single-photon entanglement is not only one of the sim-
plest forms of entanglement to generate, it is both funda-
mentally fascinating and potentially practical. At times
its mere existence was debated [1], however, today it lies
at the heart of key quantum information protocols, such
as quantum repeaters [2]. Path entanglement is generated
when a single photon is delocalized over several modes, or
paths, e.g. via a 50/50 beam splitter, where it produces
a state of the form
1√
|Ψ(cid:105) =
2

(|0(cid:105)A |1(cid:105)B + |1(cid:105)A |0(cid:105)B) ,

(1)

where A and B denote the two entangled output modes.
The versatility of this type of entanglement has been
demonstrated in experiments for teleportation [3], entan-
glement swapping [4], puriﬁcation [5], the characterisation
of multipartite entanglement [6], and is the underlying
resource for heralded photon ampliﬁcation [7].

Another direction of interest is to use single-photon
entanglement for demonstrations of quantum nonlocality
and related device-independent applications. In particu-
lar, the combination of single-photon entanglement with
weak displacement-based local measurements [8, 9] was
recently proposed as a practical platform for demonstrat-
ing loophole-free Bell-inequality violations [10, 11] and
device-independent protocols for quantum information
processing [12]. Notably, this approach oﬀers a promis-
ing alternative to standard setups based on two-photon
entanglement, with clear practical advantages, such as
the possibility of heralding the entanglement creation (at
high rates, e.g. compared to atomic systems [12–15]) and
scalability to networks involving more parties [16].

Here we report the observation of EPR steering via local
weak displacements performed on single-photon entangle-
ment, as sketched in FIG. 1. Steering was recently cast
in an operational form within quantum information the-
ory [17], experimentally demonstrated in Ref. [18] and rep-
resents the key resource for one-sided Device-Independent
(DI) protocols, i.e. where one party is treated as a black-

FIG. 1. Conceptual view of our steering experiment. Single-
photon path entanglement is created by splitting a single
photon on a beam splitter. Entanglement between the output
modes of the beam splitter is certiﬁed in a one-sided DI sce-
nario, via violation of a steering inequality. Alice’s device is
untrusted (black box), while Bob’s device implements charac-
terized (hence trusted) displacement-based detections where
the displacement D(α) is a function of a measurement input y.

box while the other is trusted [19]. In the following, we
ﬁrst theoretically develop a steering test (a so-called steer-
ing inequality [20]) tailored to our setup. We then present
an experimental violation of our steering inequality by 4
standard deviations, using a heralded single photon source
and an all-ﬁber displacement-based measurement scheme
featuring high-eﬃciency superconducting nanowire single-
photon detectors. As our setup is inherently free of any
post-selection, it is immune to the detection loophole [21].
Our experiment thus provides the conclusive demonstra-
tion of single-photon path entanglement in a one-sided DI
scenario. Moreover, our approach is directly extensible
to a loophole-free Bell-inequality test, and thus to the
implementation of fully DI protocols [12, 22].

Steering. In a generic steering experiment, as in FIG. 1,
two separate parties (Alice and Bob) perform local mea-
surements on a shared entangled state. The goal is that
Bob can verify that the shared state is indeed entangled
without trusting (or equivalently, without any knowledge
of) the measurements performed by Alice [17]. This can
be seen as a more stringent test of entanglement than
experiments using an entanglement witness, where the
measurements of both parties must be well characterised,

and less stringent than a Bell inequality test, where none
of the parties need to be characterised.

Formally, Alice receives input x and sends output a to
Bob who performs measurements on his system. Speciﬁ-
cally, let σa|x = tr[ρ(Ma|x⊗11)] denote the (unnormalized)
state of Bob when Alice measures x and obtains outcome
a, corresponding to some measurement operator Ma|x.
The set of conditional states {σa|x}a,x (an assemblage) is
termed unsteerable if it can be created by a local strategy
without using entanglement, that is, if there exists a local
hidden state (LHS) model [17] compatible with it

σa|x =

π(λ)p(a|xλ)σλ

∀a, x,

(2)

(cid:88)

λ

where σλ represents the LHS, distributed with density
π(λ), and p(a|xλ) is Alice’s response function. To verify
steering, Bob must rule out the existence of an LHS model
reproducing the data. This can be certiﬁed via violation
of so-called steering inequalities [20] (analogous to Bell
inequalities).

Steering inequality for displacements.

In order to
demonstrate steering of single-photon entanglement, we
must ﬁrst construct a steering inequality tailored to the
displacement-based measurements. The latter consist in
an optical displacement D(α) followed by (non-photon-
number-resolving) single-photon detections. In practice
they can be implemented by mixing the mode to be
measured with a local oscillator (LO) on a highly trans-
missive beam splitter, and then detecting the transmitted
mode, while the reﬂected mode is discarded [23] (see inset
FIG. 2). A no-click outcome corresponds to the projector
Π(α) = |α(cid:105)(cid:104)α|, where |α(cid:105) is a coherent state correspond-
ing to the displacement α = reiθ, where r ≥ 0 and
θ ∈ [0, 2π] [8, 10]. Assigning outcomes ±1 to the click/no-
click events respectively, a displacement measurement
then corresponds to the observable M (α) = 2|α(cid:105)(cid:104)α| − 11.
Note that such measurements are always conclusive, as
no-click events are not discarded.

Deriving a steering inequality for our setup is nontriv-
ial because Bob’s measurement operator, with binary
outcomes, lives in an inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space.
However, we can take advantage of the fact that our target
state (of the form (1)) lives in the 0-1 photon subspace,
i.e. a simple qubit subspace. We thus ﬁrst derive a steer-
ing inequality valid in the qubit subspace (using existing
methods developed for discrete systems [24, 25]) and then
extend it to the full space.

Speciﬁcally, we derive a steering inequality for a scenario
with four measurements for Alice (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) and
binary output a = ±1 of the form

inequality with the bound given by the maximal eigen-
x lxGx (where as before
lx = 0, 1). This value can be found approximately by
introducing a cut-oﬀ in photon number. If r is not too
large then one can check that the cut-oﬀ need not be very
high (e.g. for r = 0.2, a maximal photon number of 4
is suﬃcient and the contribution of 5 photons or more
is negligible). Thus, we arrive at a steering inequality
S ≤ Smax. In general, the bound will be larger than in
the subspace, i.e. Smax > S(cid:48)

The expression S can be computed directly from the
experimental data. Using (7) and the deﬁnitions of σR and

FIG. 2. Experimental setup. A heralding single photon source is coupled into ﬁber and incident on a ﬁber beam splitter (BS),
generating heralded entanglement, while local oscillator states are coupled into the same BS with orthogonal polarization. Weak
displacements, ˆD(α), ˆD(β), are performed in an all-ﬁbre conﬁguration (inset) followed by single photon detectors that constitute
the displacement-based detection. See main text for details and notation.

above steering inequality is possible using a single-photon
entangled state (1), provided the total transmission and
detection eﬃciency is above ∼ 43%.

Experiment. The experimental setup is shown in FIG. 2.
The heralded single photon source (HSPS) is based on
Type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)
in a PPKTP crystal satisfying the phase-matching condi-
tion 772 nm → 1541 nm + 1546 nm. The HSPS is pumped
by a Ti:Saphire laser in picosecond regime to generate
pure (> 90%) photons without frequency ﬁlters [26]. The
probability of generating a photon pair was set to 10−3.
The photons are then separated by a polarizing beam
splitter (PBS). Detection of one photon at 1546 nm her-
alds the presence of a single photon at 1541 nm in the
mode of an optical ﬁbre with a heralding eﬃciency close
to 80%1. A 0.5 nm interference ﬁlter is placed on the
heralding photon path of the HSPS so that the purity
of the heralded photon approaches unity. The heralded
single photon is subsequently sent to a 50:50 beam split-
ter (BS), and delocalized over two distinct spatial modes,
thus producing the path entangled state (1).

To generate the LO in the same time and frequency
mode as the heralded photons a second non-linear crys-
tal conﬁgured for diﬀerence frequency generation (DFG)
is employed. For that, the crystal is pumped by the
same laser as the HSPS and seeded with a CW laser at
1546 ˙nm [28]. In this conﬁguration, the indistinguishabil-
ity between the single photon and the coherent state is
> 97%. The LO is coupled into a single mode optical
ﬁbre, with an orthogonal polarization with respect to that
of the path entangled state at the same 50:50 BS used
to generate the entangled state. In this way, any phase
ﬂuctuations that aﬀect the single photon will equally af-
fect the LO, and the relative phases between the two is
maintained even when propagating through ﬁber. At this
stage the coherent states contain roughly 100 photons per
pulse.

1 In principle the heralding eﬃciency can be further increased to
>90% with the use of high transmission optical components [27].

Weak displacement measurements are performed in an
all-ﬁber conﬁguration by Alice, ˆD(α), and Bob, ˆD(β),
mixing their respective share of the entangled state with
the LO into a single polarization mode. In the inset of
FIG. 2 we see the conceptual version of a displacement
operation using a variable BS and the equivalent ﬁber
implementation. This is achieved through a set of polar-
ization rotators (PC) followed by a polarizer (LP), which
eﬀectively act as variable ratio BS. The polarization rota-
tors consist of three piezo actuators that introduce small
pressure-induced birefringence in the optical ﬁbre. The
polarizers project part of the LO and the photon onto
the same polarization mode, where we can vary both the
phase (θ) and amplitude r of the displacement operations.
The challenge of this experiment is to optimize each
element for maximum transmission. The ﬁelds in the
output modes are ﬁnally detected using MoSi supercon-
ducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) [29]
with eﬃciencies of 85% operating at a temperature of
around 1 K. Considering the coupling eﬃciency of 80%
and the total transmission of all optical elements in the
setup of 78%, we obtain a probability of 52% to detect
the heralded photon in case of no displacement. After a
detection the SNSPDs are inactive for a short recovery
time, so we placed a pulse picker, based on electro-optic
(amplitude) modulation, at the output of the DFG source
to reduce the rate of the experiment to 9.5 MHz. We
then use a logic gate to only herald entangled states when
the coherent state is present, achieving a repetition rate
for heralded entanglement of ∼2 kHz. To perform the
data analysis all the detection events are recorded using
a time-to-digital converter.

The bound Smax corresponds to an ideal displacement
and perfect single-photon detection. In the experiment,
the displacement is implemented using a BS of ﬁnite
transmittivity, and the single-photon detectors have ﬁnite
eﬃciency. Since Bob is a trusted party, this can in prin-
ciple be accounted for if these parameters are measured,
and will lead to a lower value of the bound. However,
we use the more stringent bound, which is not inﬂuenced
by experimental uncertainties on the detector eﬃciency,

PCLPBS(r,t)=EOMLocal Oscillator1546nm772nmFPBSHeralded Single Photon Source1546nm772nmCWTriggerAliceBob50:50TrustedUntrustedθ1541nmLSPDCDFGLLFiberBSi.e. that all the losses due to the detector ineﬃciency are
considered as losses before the displacement.

To set the displacement amplitudes, we measure the
probability of obtaining a detection when only the co-
herent state is present and obtain rA = 0.233 ± 0.013
and rB = 0.217 ± 0.005, which according to theoretical,
modeling should give a clear violation of (8). In order to
implement the diﬀerent measurement settings, we must
vary the phase of the displacements. We implement an
active phase change on Alice’s side, while Bob’s remains
ﬁxed. We vary Alice’s phase (thus changing the relative
phase between Alice and Bob) in small steps and record
the number of detection and non-detection events. From
the results, we extract the joint probabilities p(a, b) as a
function of Alice’s phase, shown in FIG. 3.
To obtain the probabilities p(a, b|x, y), we then pick
four points on the curve (indicated by arrows) correspond-
ing to x = 1, 2, 3, 4 and y = 1. In order to obtain the
probabilities for y = 2, 3, 4, we observe that ﬁxing Bob’s
phase corresponds to choosing a given reference frame.
Note that the phase of the LO is not well deﬁned, in other
words there is no preferred reference frame. If the ampli-
tude rA is independent of the phase, then going from one
frame to another (i.e. changing Bob’s phase) corresponds
to a permutation of the labels of Alice’s measurements.
Here we will assume the latter, which allows us to extract
all probabilities p(a, b|x, y) from the data, and hence test
the steering inequality.
This analysis leads to ∆Sexp = S − Smax = (4.95 ±
1.24) · 10−3, i.e. a violation of the steering inequality
by 4 standard deviations (details about the error cal-
culation are given in the supplementary information in
Appendix). To cross-check this result, we ﬁt the data
of FIG. 3 to a cosine (as expected from theoretical mod-
eling) and extract p(a, b|x, y) from the ﬁt. We obtain
∆Sf it = (2.19 ± 1.05) · 10−3. This is in good agree-
ment with theoretical predictions (obtained from the es-
timated density matrix and experimental parameters):
∆Stheo = (2.07 ± 0.03) · 10−3. The fact that ∆Sexp gives
a larger value is primarily due to the data point corre-
sponding to maximal correlations being slightly above the
ﬁt.

Discussion. We have demonstrated steering of a single-
photon entangled state via local weak-displacement mea-
surements based on a novel steering inequality adapted to
our setup. The 4 standard deviation violation represents
a conclusive measurement of single-photon entanglement
in a one-sided DI scenario, with applications to partially
DI protocols, such as one-sided DI cryptography.

As our setup is completely free of any post-selection,
it is in principle directly amenable to a loophole-free
Bell inequality test. This would require increasing the
detection eﬃciency from about 50% to more than 83.5%
for a bipartite test, or > 74% for 4-partite Bell tests with
three settings per party. While the bipartite case is clearly
challenging [30], a similar setup has already demonstrated
3-partite entanglement [16]. This represents a promising
platform for future implementations of DI and semi-DI

the full space

In this section, we provide additional information on
how to extend the family of steering inequalities above
to the full Fock space, and give the coeﬃcients for the
speciﬁc inequality used in our experiment.

R, G(cid:48)

As explained in the main text, we decompose the ma-
trices G(cid:48)
x in terms of the identity operator and a set
of measurement operators of the form (A1) with a ﬁxed
r = rB and some set of angles θy, and then extend to the
full space by replacing (A1) by the measurement operator
in the full space. We pick the set {0, π/2, π, 3π/2}. This
gives an overcomplete set of operators spanning the space
of 2x2 matrices. Hence, there is no unique decomposi-
tion of the G(cid:48)-matrices, and diﬀerent decompositions will
result in diﬀerent steering inequalities in the full space
that may be harder or easier to violate. We could have
picked a smaller set of angles, e.g. {0, 2π/3, 4π/3}, result-
ing in a linearly independent set of operators and hence
unique decompositions. However, we have found that the
following decomposition results in a favourable steering
inequality in the full space in terms of ease of violation
by our (approximate) single-photon state.

We ﬁrst decompose each G(cid:48)-matrix on the set
{σX , σY , σZ, 1} consisting of the Pauli operators and the
identity. This decomposition is unique. Then we use the
following decomposition of the Pauli operators in terms
of the measurements M (r, θy)

This is the decomposition we use to deﬁne our steering
inequality in the full space. That is, we ﬁx the coeﬃcients
cνy, cν0 in (B4) and replace Π(cid:48)(rB, θ) by the full-space
operator Π(rB, θ) = |α(cid:105)(cid:104)α|, where α = rBeiθ, to get

Gν =

Fock basis representation of |α(cid:105) = e−r2/2(cid:80)∞

To get the unsteerable bound in the full space, we need to
compute the largest eigenvalue of any of the matrices GR +
x=1 lxGx with lx = 0, 1. For given values of rB, s, and
t, we compute these eigenvalues numerically by using the
|n(cid:105)
to express the G’s as matrices in the Fock basis, and then
introducing a cut-oﬀ in photon number. We increase the
cut-oﬀ until the numerically found maximal eigenvalue no
longer changes. For small rB, the cut-oﬀ does not need
to be very large. E.g. for rB = 0.2, a cut-oﬀ at n ≤ 4 is
suﬃcient.
Finally, to get a steering inequality in terms of the ob-
served probabilities p(ab|xy), we use the relation between
Bob’s projector and the POVM elements corresponding
to the outcomes b = ±1, which is Π+|y = Π(rB, θy) and
Π−|y = 1 − Π(rB, θy). We also have 1 = Π+|y + Π−|y for
any y. In particular, we can take 1 = 1
y(Π+|y + Π−|y).

a. Experimental inequality

Calculation of the steering value S from experimental
data will be aﬀected by uncertainties in the estimated
probabilities p(ab|xy), and both S and the bound Smax
are aﬀected by uncertainty or ﬂuctuations in the value
of rB, the amplitude of Bob’s displacement. To account
for the fact that a perturbation in rB aﬀects both S and
Smax, we rewrite the steering inequality as S − Smax ≤ 0
and perform the error analysis for the quantity S − Smax.
To properly deﬁne the error bar with all the error
sources, we have used a type of Monte-Carlo algorithm.

For the experiment, we take s = 0.983, t = 0.0656, and
we have rB = 0.21 ± 0.01. From these numbers we obtain
the coeﬃcients (taking the mean value of rB; the eﬀect
of the uncertainty on rB is discussed below)
