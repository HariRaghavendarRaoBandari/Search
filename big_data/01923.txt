ABSTRACT

Energetic electrons with power-law spectrum are most commonly observed in

astrophysics. This paper investigates electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME)

from the power-law electrons, in which strong pitch-angle anisotropy is empha-

sized. The electron distribution function proposed in this paper can describe

various types of pitch-angle anisotropy. Results show that the emission proper-

ties of ECME, including radiation growth, propagation, and frequency properties,

depend considerably on the types of electron pitch-angle anisotropy, and diﬀer-

ent wave modes show diﬀerent dependences on the pitch angle of electrons. In

particular, the maximum growth rate of X2 mode rapidly decreases with respect

to the electron pitch-angle cosine µ0 at which the electron distribution peaks,

while the growth rates for other modes (X1, O1, O2) initially increase before

decreasing as µ0 increases. Moreover, the O mode as well as the X mode can

be the fastest growth mode, in terms of not only the plasma parameter but also

the type of electron pitch-angle distribution. This result presents a signiﬁcant

extension of the recent researches on ECME driven by the lower-energy cutoﬀ of

power-law electrons, in which the X mode is generally the fastest growth mode.

Introduction

There are a lot of radio emission mechanisms such as plasma emission and gyroemission

in astrophysics (e.g., Melrose 1980; Dulk 1985; Nindos et al. 2008). Among these

mechanisms, electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) is a well-known emission

mechanism in terms of directly amplifying electromagnetic waves. This mechanism was

proposed by Twiss (1958), who pointed out that the induced absorption may become

negative for electrons with a population inversion in a higher energy state. Subsequently

further discussions about this mechanism were carried out by authors (e.g., Bekeﬁ et al.

1961; Hirshﬁeld 1963; Melrose 1973, 1976). Particularly, Wu & Lee (1979) presented a

breakthrough work via introducing weak relativistic correction, which signiﬁcantly enhances

the emission eﬃciency of ECME. Since then, ECME gained much attention due to its

simplicity as well as eﬃciency (Wu 1985, and references therein). It has been applied

extensively to various radio emissions from astrophysical objects, such as Earth’s auroral

kilometric radiation, Jovian’s decametric radiation (Zarka 1998), solar microwave spike

and meter wave bursts (Melrose & Dulk 1982; Sharma et al. 1982; Fleishman & Mel’nikov

1998; Wu et al. 2002; Yoon et al. 2002), radio emissions from other ﬂare stars (Benz et al.

1998; Bingham et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2003), the time-varying emission from strongly

magnetized blazar jets (Begelman et al. 2005), and radio emissions from the very low mass

stars and dwarfs (Hallinan et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2012; Nichols et al. 2012), etc. For details

one can also refer to the literature (Treumann 2006; Bingham et al. 2013).

In the context of ECME, the pitch-angle anisotropies of non-thermal electrons have

been extensively studied. These pitch-angle anisotropies may be classiﬁed into three

types: the loss cone, oblique beam, and the beam with crescent-shaped conﬁguration. For

instance, in the 1980s the loss cone (or a ring distribution; Dory et al. 1965) was ﬁrst

developed by many authors to discuss auroral kilometric radiation, solar microwave spike

– 4 –

bursts and similar radio emissions from other magnetized planets and ﬂare stars (e.g.,

Melrose & Dulk 1982; Sharma & Vlahos 1984; Winglee 1985; Winglee & Dulk 1986). The

oblique beam (or hollow beam) was researched consequently by other authors, and later

was used to discuss solar type II and type III radio bursts (Wu & Freund 1984; Li 1986;

Wu et al. 2002; Yoon et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2014). For the beam with crescent-shaped

conﬁguration (or horseshoe distribution), one can refer to the literature (Bingham & Cairns

2002; Bingham et al. 2003; Vorgul et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2012). It should be noted that the

energy distributions of non-thermal electrons in literatures above were described mainly on

the basis of a Maxwellian or drift-Maxwellian distribution.

A power-law energy distribution of non-thermal electrons, however, is demonstrated

frequently by observations of microwave bursts and hard X-rays, which are two

prime diagnostic tools to study particle acceleration and energy release in solar

ﬂares (Kundu & Vlahos 1982; Dennis 1985). Consequently one can believe that the

energetic electrons emitting radiations from the Sun may generally have the power-law

energy distribution. Furthermore, recent observations of microwave bursts presented

evidences of pitch-angle anisotropies of power-law electrons, as suggested by the paper

(Fleishman & Melnikov 2003a,b) in which authors remarked that nonisotropic pitch-angle

distributions of energetic electrons should be rather common in ﬂares. In particular,

the study by Altyntsev et al. (2008) presented ﬁrm evidence that the microwave burst is

generated by an oblique beam of electrons. Using electron beams with strong pitch-angle

anisotropy, a few studies were subsequently carried out to explore the microwave emissions

based on gyrosynchrotron mechanism (Zharkova et al. 2010; Kuznetsov & Zharkova 2010;

Zharkova et al. 2011).

Theoretically, it can be expected that energetic electrons probably have some pitch-

angle anisotropy, such as transverse or parallel anisotropy, depending on the acceleration

– 5 –

mechanism, the injection site, as well as their propagation of accelerated electrons in ﬂaring

regions (Melnikov et al. 2009). A ring distribution can be expected if beamed electrons

from a ﬂare are injected in the direction perpendicular to ambient magnetic ﬁeld. On the

other hand, some structures such as magnetic mirror and shock may also contribute to the

formation of a ring distribution. The ring of electrons (or a loss cone) is believed to be a

natural consequence of magnetic mirror conﬁnement, in which the electrons are trapped

(Dory et al. 1965; Trievelpiece et al. 1968; Louarn et al. 1990; Roux et al. 1993; Melrose

1994). A shock can produce ring shaped electron distribution according to the literature

(Bingham et al. 2003; Kajdiˇc et al. 2014). When ﬁeld-aligned electrons move into an

increasing magnetic ﬁeld, a crescent-shaped beam distribution shall be created in terms of

the conservation of the ﬁrst adiabatic invariant (Bingham et al. 2013). If enhanced Alfv´en

turbulence exists, the crescent-shaped beam may also be made by pitch-angle scattering

even though the ﬁeld-aligned electrons move along an open magnetic ﬁeld (Lu et al. 2006).

In general, the beamed electrons appear as an oblique beam when they are injected in a

direction with an angle not 0◦ or 90◦ with respect to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld.

Energetic electrons with distributions above are unstable and will eﬃciently drive

ECME once the local plasma frequency is comparable to or less than the electron

gyrofrequency. (R´egnier (2015) recently showed that this condition is fulﬁlled in solar active

regions based on a quantitative research.) Within the context of the ECME from power-law

electrons, a lot of works have been presented, though these studies mainly focus on the

loss cone anisotropy. Fleishman & Yastrebov (1994) ﬁrst calculated the linear growth rate

of ECME in detail, in which a gaussian loss cone distribution with the maximum at the

pitch angle of 90◦ was considered. Stupp (2000) used an ideal loss cone to investigate

ECME taking the absorption by the ambient thermal plasma into account. Tang & Wu

(2009) introduced another kind of loss cone to discuss the ECME in coronal loops. Less

detailed attention, to the best of our knowledge, has been paid to other types of pitch-angle

– 6 –

anisotropy, such as the beam. Electron beams are believed to be an elementary ingredient

of solar activity (Aschwanden 2002). The electrons with the feature of beam are also

required to produce solar type III radio bursts, in which ECME may play an important role

(Huang 1998; Wu et al. 2002; Yoon et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2013a; Wang 2015). Hence, it

should be desirable to explore the ECME from power-law electrons including various types

of pitch-angle anisotropy, especially the beam.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we model the electron distribution

function used in the present paper, which is characterized by a power-law spectrum and

may represent various types of electron distribution via varying the pitch-angle parameters.

In Section 3, we show the emission properties of ECME from the power-law electrons

with various types of pitch-angle anisotropy, by calculating growth rates, as well as the

corresponding propagation angles and frequencies of radiations. Finally, conclusions with

some brief discussion are given in Section 4.

2. Distribution function for power-law electrons

To model the distribution of energetic electrons, we ﬁrst adopt a factorized form of

the distribution function f (E, µ) = f1(E)f2(µ). We further consider that (1) energetic

electrons have a power-law spectrum in energy distribution; (2) the angular distribution

is anisotropic and can be described by a Gaussian function (Lee & Gary 2000); (3) the

eﬀect of lower energy cutoﬀ of the power-law spectrum may be important to excite ECME
(Wu & Tang 2008). Consideration (1) implies f1(E) ∝ E −α, where α is the power index.
], where A2 is the normalized
Consideration (2) suggests the form f2(µ) = A2 exp [−
factor, µ0 denotes the pitch-angle cosine at which the distribution function has maximum,

(µ−µ0)2

∆µ2

and ∆µ is the half-width in pitch angles. For consideration (3), a relevant discuss should

be appropriate as follows.

– 7 –

In fact, observations of hard X-rays revealed not only a power-law spectrum of energetic

electrons, but also a lower energy cutoﬀ phenomenon of the power-law spectrum (e.g.,

Lin 1974, 2011). The lower energy cutoﬀ is theoretically necessary, since it contributes to

a reasonable number and energy ﬂux of electrons accelerated during ﬂares, as well as to

avoid a rapid thermalization of non-thermal electrons with the cutoﬀ energy well above the

thermal energy of the plasma (see, a review by Holman et al. 2011). We shall consider this

phenomenon in our study.

The generation of the lower energy cutoﬀ may be attributed to a particle acceleration

mechanism related to non-neutral reconnecting current sheets in the solar corona

(Somov & Oreshina 2000). Simulation results revealed that the energy spectra of

accelerated electrons have rather complicated shapes, which are not entirely power-law ones.

These spectra show a sharp increase from zero to a maximum at some energy followed by an

approximate power-law distribution at higher energies (Zharkova & Gordovskyy 2005a,b;

Zharkova & Agapitov 2009). Authors also suggested that the energy with maximum can

be considered as the lower energy cutoﬀ of power-law electrons deduced from hard X-rays

observations.

In general, it is very diﬃcult to obtain a special form for the lower energy cutoﬀ

based on observations and simulations, and some assumptions were often imposed in

describing the lower energy cutoﬀ to proceed with the discussion. Some authors assumed

that the distribution function is a constant for electrons with energy below the cutoﬀ

energy (Li & Cairns 2013; Khalilpour 2015). More authors considered a zero value of the

distribution function for the lower energy electrons (e.g., Fleishman & Yastrebov 1994;

Stupp 2000). Both assumptions above correspond to two extreme cases, the saturation

cutoﬀ and the sharp cutoﬀ discussed by Gan et al. (2001). For a general case, the energy

distribution of the lower energy electrons, in our opinion, should have a positive slope

– 8 –

as revealed by simulations. To approximately describe the positive slope some sigmoid

function is invoked in this paper. The hyperbolic tangent function is a sigmoid function, and

has been used to model the loss cone electron distribution to avoid an inﬁnitely sharp loss

cone boundary (Yoon et al. 1998; Lee et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2015). This function is simple

in form and has properties of the well-known logistic function, showing fast rise before

approaching a constant of unit. Further, we shall use the function form tanh (E/Ec)δ, where

δ is called steepness index and determines the steepness when the function curve rises, Ec

denotes the cutoﬀ energy, leading the function curve to approach unit when E > Ec.

Consequently the energy distribution is given by f1(E) = A1 tanh (E/Ec)δE −α, where

A1 is the corresponding normalized factor. Certainly, we emphasize that the hyperbolic

tangent function is only our selection to ﬁt the lower energy cutoﬀ. Other choices are

possible and an exact form should be explored in future studies. It should be noted that

our selection of tanh (E/Ec)δ can conveniently make the distribution, i.e., f1(E), deduce

two extreme cases above, depending on diﬀerent values of δ and α. That is the saturation

cutoﬀ when δ ∼ α, and the sharp cutoﬀ when δ ≫ α (Wu & Tang 2008). For general cases
of δ > α, f1(E) describes a population inversion at E ≃ Ec.

Finally, we represent the electron distribution as

f (E, µ) = A1A2 tanh (E/Ec)δE −α exp [−

(µ − µ0)2

∆µ2

].

From Equation (1), it is convenient to obtain the electron distribution in momentum space,

by the transformation

F (u, µ) =

f (E, µ)

(2)

with E = √m2c2u2 + m2c4 − mc2, where m is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, and

u is the momentum per unit mass. Note that above the cutoﬀ energy F (u) also approaches

a power-law with spectral index as follows: 2α + 1 when u ≪ c and α + 2 when u ≫ c.

– 9 –

Figure 1 plots the contours of the distribution function in momentum space, where

uz and u⊥ are the components of the vector u parallel and perpendicular to the ambient

magnetic ﬁeld. The momentum has been normalized by the speed of light. To obtain Figure

1, we have set the power index α = 3 in every panel, since this value is typical according to

observations of microwaves and hard X-rays from the Sun (Stupp 2000; Asai et al. 2013).

The cutoﬀ energy Ec is diﬃcult to be determined unambiguously, and a large range from

ten to hundred keV has been reported (Gan et al. 2001; Huang 2009). We have set Ec = 20

keV (corresponding to a velocity of electron about 0.28c). The steepness index δ is an

arbitrary parameter and the value of δ = 6 have been chosen following our previous studies

(Wu & Tang 2008; Zhao et al. 2013b). We will ﬁx above parameter values throughout the

paper. The present paper shall focus on the pitch-angle anisotropy, which is determined

by µ0 and ∆µ. µ0 is in the range 0 ≤ µ0 ≤ 1. ∆µ ≪ 1 is considered to obtain a strong
pitch-angle anisotropy. Figure 1 shows the cases µ0 = 0, 0.5, 1, respectively, at a given

value ∆µ = 0.2. One can ﬁnd that Equation (1), depending on the value of µ0, describes

a ring (transverse anisotropy, panel (a)), an oblique beam (panel (b)), and a beam with

crescent-shaped conﬁguration (parallel anisotropy, panel (c)). The ring distribution appears

as a 90◦ pitch-angle enhancement and a partial absence of electrons with small u⊥ even

when uz = 0.

3. ECME from the power-law electrons

This section aims to reveal the emission properties of ECME from energetic electrons

described by Equation (1), but for diﬀerent distribution types in terms of diﬀerent

pitch-angle parameters, especially µ0. The study is based on the well known linear kinetic

theory of ECME, which is summarized in the Appendix. Given a plasma parameter,

one can calculate the temporal growth rate (γσ) numerically with two variables, i.e., the

– 10 –

diﬀerent parameter values of µ0, panels (a)−(c) present a ring, an oblique beam, and a beam
with crescent-shaped conﬁguration, respectively. In all panels the parameter ∆µ = 0.2 is

ﬁxed .

distributions used in each panel correspond to those given by panels (a)−(c) of Figure 1,
respectively.

– 11 –

propagation angle (θ) and the frequency (ω) of an emitted wave. All the growth rates

in this paper will be normalized by Ωenb/n0, where Ωe is the electron gyrofrequency, n0

and nb are electron number densities of the ambient plasma and non-thermal component,

respectively. The peak growth rate is the growth rate with the highest magnitude as a

function of one variable while the other is ﬁxed. The maximum growth rate refers to the

highest value in both variables. During the calculation two points are considered: (1) all

electrons have a energy below 2 MeV; (This point actually have little eﬀect on the results

as long as the break energy, i.e. 2 MeV here, is higher much than the cutoﬀ energy Ec

according to our calculations.) (2) all emitted waves have cutoﬀ frequencies ωoc ≃ ωpe for
the ordinary (O) mode and ωxc ≃ qω2
e/4 + Ωe/2 for the extraordinary (X) mode,

where ωpe is the plasma frequency. Figure 2 plots the peak growth rate of X2 mode (the

pe + Ω2

harmonic X mode, as an example) with respect to the propagation angle. The plasma

parameter ωpe/Ωe = 0.1 has been set. Note that the electron distributions used in panels

(a)−(c) of Figure 2 correspond to the ring, oblique beam, and the beam as shown in Figure
1. It is clear that the forms of curves in panels (a)−(c) of Figure 2 are considerably diﬀerent
from one another, implying a strong dependence of emission properties on the types of

pitch-angle anisotropy. These properties may be revealed not only by the maximum growth

rate (referred to as “growth rate” hereafter for convenience), but also by the propagation

angle and frequency corresponding to the maximum growth, called “maximum propagation

angle” and “maximum frequency” in the present paper.

Figure 3 presents the growth rate γmax (top row), maximum propagation angle

θmax (middle row), and maximum frequency ωmax (bottom row), by varying the plasma

parameter from 0.01 to 2. The left column, middle column, and right column, correspond

to three cases of electron distribution given by Figure 1. X1, O1 and O2 modes as well as

X2 mode are included, where X1 is the fundamental wave in the X mode, O1 and O2 are

the fundamental and harmonic waves in the O mode (appearing in red for comparison).

– 12 –

Some common results can be found from Figure 3. First, the growth rates of all wave

modes initially increase with ωpe/Ωe, but sharply drop at some value of ωpe/Ωe. Every wave

mode is eﬀectively emitted within some range of ωpe/Ωe; the X1 mode has the smallest

range because it is the ﬁrst wave mode to be suppressed as ωpe/Ωe increases. Second, all

wave modes have a maximum propagation angle θmax > 45◦ for a small plasma parameter,

therefore appearing as quasi-perpendicular propagation. Diﬀerent wave modes often have

diﬀerent maximum propagation angles. The propagation angle for a given wave mode

may decrease rapidly when ωpe/Ωe approaches some value, at which the wave suﬀers a

suppression due to the cutoﬀ frequency and becomes to be quasi-parallel propagation. All

wave modes satisfy the maximum frequency ω ≈ sΩe when they are excited eﬃciently,
where s is the harmonic number; s = 1 for fundamental waves and s = 2 for harmonic

waves. A large departure of the maximum frequency from sΩe may appear when the

maximum frequency is close to the cut oﬀ frequency, but meanwhile the growth rate drops

considerably. Finally, the X1 mode has a maximum frequency always larger than the

electron gyrofrequency Ωe.

In particular, clear diﬀerences of emission properties can be found from the columns of

Figure 3, which correspond to diﬀerent values of µ0. First, the X2 mode always has the

highest growth rate in the range ωpe/Ωe . 1.4 when µ0 = 0, though it is not the case when

µ0 = 0.5 and 1. In the latter cases the X1 mode can grow faster than the X2 mode; the

X1 mode becomes the fastest growth mode in the range ωpe/Ωe . 0.2 − 0.25. (The range
of ωpe/Ωe to excite the X1 mode tends to be wider for µ0 = 0.5 than that for µ0 = 1.) The

O1 mode has a comparative growth rate relative to the X2 mode in the range ωpe/Ωe . 0.5

when µ0 = 0.5, while its growth rate is higher much than that of the X2 mode in a large

range ωpe/Ωe . 1 when µ0 = 1. Second, the maximum propagation angles of X2 and O1

modes are 90◦ in a large range of ωpe/Ωe when µ0 = 0, but they are less than 90◦ when

µ0 = 0.5 and 1. The maximum propagation angle of the X1 mode is less than 60◦ when

µ0 = 0, while it can exceed 75◦ in the case of µ0 = 1. All wave modes sharing the same

maximum propagation angle can happen only when µ0 = 1. Third, all wave modes, except

for the X1 mode, have maximum frequencies mainly below sΩe when µ0 = 0, but always

above sΩe when µ0 = 1.

As expected, the results in Figure 3 reveal the sensitivities of emission properties to

the types of electron pitch-angle anisotropy concerning the pitch-angle parameter µ0. To

elaborate these results Figure 4 is presented with a continuous change of µ0 value from 0

to 1. The left column is for ωpe/Ωe = 0.1 so that the X1 mode can be emitted eﬃciently,

and the right column is for ωpe/Ωe = 0.6. One may ﬁrst note that the growth rate of the

X2 mode decreases rapidly as µ0 increases, although growth rates of other modes initially

increase and then decrease with µ0. The growth rates of other modes peak at µ0 ≈ 0.6 for
the X1 (if it is excited) and O1 modes, and at µ0 ≈ 0.5 for the O2 mode. On the other
hand, the fastest growth mode, i.e. having the highest growth rate, is the X2 mode for a

smaller value of µ0, while it becomes the X1 mode (left column) or the O1 mode (right

column) when µ0 value is large. For maximum propagation angles, the angle of the O2

mode is about 80◦ and does not vary much with respect to µ0, but the angles of the O1

and X2 modes decrease nearly simultaneously from 90◦ to slightly less than 80◦. On the

contrary, the angle of the X1 mode increases monotonously from about 38◦ to 75◦. From

bottom panels of Figure 4, one can see that maximum frequencies of the O1, O2 and X2

modes increases monotonously from frequencies below sΩe to those above sΩe, and the

maximum frequency of the X1 mode initially increase and then decrease with the frequency

always larger than Ωe.

So far the discussion mainly focus on the situation of non-thermal electrons with

strong pitch-angle anisotropy (∆µ = 0.2). One may want to know what result will be

obtained when the electron distribution varies from a strong pitch-angle anisotropy to a

nearly isotropic velocity distribution. To explore this issue Figure 5 is also plotted, in which

the value of ∆µ changes from 0.1 to 1. Similar to Figure 4, the left column of Figure 5

is for ωpe/Ωe = 0.1 and the right column for ωpe/Ωe = 0.6, but µ0 = 1 is ﬁxed in both

columns. The parameter values ∆µ ≪ 1 with µ0 = 1 mean a beam distribution as shown in
Figure 1(c), while the value ∆µ ≃ 1 implies that the electron distribution is rather isotropy.
During the process of ∆µ increasing, emission properties of all wave modes except for X1

mode vary much. In particular, the growth rate of X2 mode rapidly increases with ∆µ, so

that the X2 mode becomes the fastest growth mode regardless of values of µ0 when ∆µ ≃ 1.
Meanwhile maximum propagation angle of the X2 mode approaches 90◦ and the maximum

frequency becomes to be below 2Ωe.

4. Discussion and conclusions

ECME is a powerful emission mechanism and has been extensively applied to various

radio emissions from astrophysical objects (see, e.g., a review by Treumann 2006). Energetic

electrons characterized by a power-law spectrum with lower energy cutoﬀ, on the other

hand, are frequently observed in astrophysics (e.g., Holman et al. 2003; Hededal et al.

2004; Drake et al. 2006). Further studies reveal that these energetic electrons appear

probably with strong pitch-angle anisotropy (Melnikov et al. 2009; Zharkova et al. 2010;

Kuznetsov & Zharkova 2010; Zharkova et al. 2011). It should be desirable to ﬁnd a general

distribution function to describe the power-law electrons with strong pitch-angle anisotropy

and investigate ECME from these electrons.

It is very diﬃcult to obtain an accurate electron distribution because of highly

uncertain physical situations, for instance, in the solar active regions with ﬂares. We

emphasize that the electron distribution proposed in the present paper are mainly based

on observations of microwave bursts and hard X-rays from solar ﬂares, revealing both a

– 18 –

power-law spectrum with lower energy cutoﬀ and an anisotropic pitch-angle distribution

of energetic electrons. It should be noted that the distribution in the present paper can

describe diﬀerent distribution types with strong pitch-angle anisotropy, such as a ring, an

oblique beam, and a beam with crescent-shaped conﬁguration depending on pitch-angle

parameters.

The distribution in the present paper allows us to conveniently compare emission

properties of ECME for diﬀerent types of electron distribution. Results show pronounced

diﬀerences of the emission properties concerning the fastest growth mode, maximum

propagation angle and maximum frequency for the diﬀerent distribution types. First,

for the ring X2 mode is the fastest growth mode in a large range of plasma parameter

(ωpe/Ωe . 1.4). But for the beam electron distribution, O1 or X1 mode will become the

fastest growth mode if the plasma parameter ωpe/Ωe . 1; X1 mode is the fastest growth

mode only when ωpe/Ωe . 0.2. For an oblique beam, O1, X1, and X2 modes may grow with

a comparable growth rate. Second, in the case of the ring, the wave propagation angles

corresponding to the maximum growths are mainly 90◦ for O1 and X2 modes, while they

are always less than 90◦ in other two cases. Third, all wave modes have the maximum

frequencies above sΩe for the beam electron distribution, though it is not the case for other

two types of electron distribution.

We also investigate the eﬀect of the pitch angle of power-law electrons on ECME via

continuously varying the pitch angle from 90◦ to 0◦, or its cosine µ0 from 0 to 1. Diﬀerent

wave modes show diﬀerent dependences on the pitch angle. The growth rates for X1, O1

and O2 modes initially increase and then decrease with µ0, though the growth rate for

X2 mode decreases rapidly as µ0 increases. During the process the maximum propagation

angles monotonously decrease for the O1 as well as the X2 mode, but increase for the X1

mode. The maximum frequencies for all wave modes become to be above sΩe when µ0

– 19 –

approaches unit.

Furthermore, the present study extends the discussions of ECME driven by the lower

energy cutoﬀ of power-law electrons. Wu & Tang (2008) found that power-law electrons

with the lower energy cutoﬀ are unstable and can eﬃciently drive the ECM instability.

Authors also pointed out that growth rates of X mode are considerably higher than those of

O mode. Although other works were carried out to explore this new ECME via introducing

a loss cone or temperature anisotropy in the distribution function, results always suggest

that the fastest growth mode is the X mode (Tang & Wu 2009; Tang et al. 2011, 2013).

However, the present study reveals that the fastest growth mode in the ECME may be

the O mode as well as the X mode, once the electron pitch-angle anisotropy is considered.

The fastest growth mode is the X mode when the power-law electrons are transversely

anisotropic or (nearly) isotropic, but it can be the O mode if those electrons have a parallel

anisotropy.

In summary, two purposes have been pursued in this paper. One is the proposal of a

more general electron distribution, which includes the informations of energy spectrum,

lower energy cutoﬀ, as well as the pitch-angle distribution. The other is the study of

ECME driven by this general electron distribution. We have shown an electron distribution

function that can describe various types of electron distribution, and therefore compared

the emission properties for diﬀerent electron distribution types.
