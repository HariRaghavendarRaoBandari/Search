We consider the electromagnetic production of positron in collision of heavy nuclei, with the simultaneously
produced electron captured by one of the nuclei. This cross-section exceeds by about four orders of magnitude
the cross-section of e

− production.

Positron production in collision of heavy nuclei (as well as the production of e+e− pair), was addressed in numerous papers
(see, for instance, [1]-[3]). In the present note we reconsider the problem of the positron production in collision of heavy nuclei,
and derive a simple expression for the corresponding cross-section.

The diagram related to our problem is presented in Fig. 1. The bold lines in this diagram correspond to the propagation of
non-relativistic heavy nuclei with initial momenta ±¯p, and ﬁnal momenta ¯p1,2. For the velocities of nuclei we assume v = 0.1
(or v/c = 0.1 in usual units). The wavy line in Fig. 1 refers to the virtual photon producing the pair e+e−. The produced
electron is captured immediately by one of the nuclei, thus creating a single-electron ion; this ion by itself is also on mass shell.
The four-momentum of the produced positron is kµ = (k0, ¯k), we will neglect here the interaction of positron with nuclei.
captured either by the upper nucleus, or by the lower one. We note also that the produced positron introducesR d¯k/2k0 into the

The overal factor in the discussed cross-section is 2Z 2α2/π; the factor 2 here is due to the fact that the electron can be

discussed cross-section.

We address now the essential factor in the cross-section under discussion:

(¯p − ¯p1)4 δ(cid:0)¯p1 + ¯p2 + ¯k(cid:1) δ(cid:0)¯p2/M − ¯p2

2/2M − k0(cid:1) ;

(1)

here and below M is the mass of colliding nuclei. This is the only structure in our problem dependent on ¯p1 and ¯p2. Integrating
it explicitly over ¯p2, we arrive at

Z d¯p1

(¯p − ¯p1)4 δ(¯p2/M − ¯p1

2/M − k0);

here we have omitted negligibly small term ¯p1¯k/M in the argument of delta-function.

Integral (2) is conveniently rewritten as follows:

we have neglected here one more small term −¯q2/M . Let us split now vector ¯q into the part parallel to ¯v, and the part orthogonal
to ¯v, i.e. into qk and ¯q⊥. Then

to simplify rather tedious formulas, we conﬁne here and below to the case of ultrarelativistic positron. Thus integral (1) reduces
to the simple expression 2πv/k2.

Let us address now the fermion loop arising in the amplitude squared. The upper part of this loop, corresponding to the
positron propagation, is ˆk − m (as mentioned, we neglect the positron rescattering). The lower part of this loop is a single-
electron ion of small velocity v ∼ 0.1, and we will neglect its velocity at all. Then, the ion can be considered as a particle of
mass M at rest, with the sort of ’density matrix’ M (γ0 + 1). Obviously, the huge mass M is irrelevant for the present purpose,
so that the only external characteristic of this single-electron ion at rest is γ0 + 1. Then, the reasonable estimate for discussed
characteristic of the ﬁnal system, consisting of the positron and single-electron ion, is

Sp(ˆk − m)γ3(γ0 + 1)γ3 = 4(k0 + m) ≃ 4k.

(6)

We assume here that the nuclei propagate along the z axis. Together with the Feynman gauge, this is the origin of γ3 in the above
formula.

We consider now in more detail the electron captured by nucleus. For the wave function squared of this electron in the
momentum representation, we conﬁne to the non-relativistic approximation. This approximation is quite common in such
problems, and usually works with a reasonable accuracy. In the present case, such wave function squared is as follows [4]:

here and below ζ = Zαm. In this way, we arrive at the following expression for the cross-section discussed:

Thus, the cross-section of positron production in the collision of slow heavy ions gets independent on Zα:

(see (8)),there is one more, rather similar, contribution to the discussed effect. It is the leading relativistic correction to the wave
function (7) (the complete form of the wave function in momentum space can be found, for instance, in [5]):

Both results, (10) and (13), were obtained in the non-relativistic approximation for the wave function of the captured electron.

In conclusion, let us come back to the absolute value of the discussed cross-section. According to our estimate, it should be
about 10−21 cm2. This estimate exceeds essentially the cross-section of e+e− production in heavy ion collisions, which is about
10−25 cm2.
