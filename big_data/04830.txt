Abstract

Room-temperature (RT) conductivity of most candidates for solid electrolytes of miniaturized

lithium-ion batteries is still 1-2 orders of magnitude below commercial requirements, therefore

several approaches are being pursued aiming the enhancement of such values. In this letter, we

report for the ﬁrst time direct theoretical evidence that epitaxial strain can be an eﬃcient tool to

reach this goal.

Signiﬁcant eﬀort is now being devoted to developing solid materials that can replace

Li-based liquid electrolytes currently used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), since Li-based

liquid electrolytes are ﬂammable, toxic, incompatible with the highest speciﬁc energy anode

(lithium metal), and pose a limit to miniaturization.[1–4] However, at room-temperature
(RT), Li+ conductivity in the best solid electrolytes (≤ 25 mS/cm) is still 1-2 orders of
magnitude below that in liquid counterparts (> 100 mS/cm).[5–8] Several attempts are

being performed to solve this issue, including search and design of new materials as well

as the properties tailoring of well-established materials using non-stoichiometry, doping,

chemical substitutions and reﬁned synthesis techniques.
[3, 5–10] An approach that has
been proven particularly eﬃcient to improve O2− transport in electrolytes of miniaturized
all-solid-state fuel cells is the use of epitaxial strain obtained by depositing a thin-ﬁlm on a

substrate with a mismatching lattice parameter.[11–17] Recently, Tealdi et al [18] also used

this approach to predict a one order of magnitude enhancement at 500 K for cathodes of Li-

and Na-ion batteries, with an even larger enhancement being expected at room temperature.

Notwithstanding, no analogue strain-induced enhancement has been reported so far in Li+-

conducting candidates for solid electrolytes in miniaturized LIBs. [19, 20]

In this Letter, we show clearly a signiﬁcant Li+ conductivity enhancement (by orders of

magnitude) induced by strain in a solid electrolyte, opening a new window for ionic transport

improvement in such materials, aiming their use in miniaturized LIBs. Our result was

obtained by calculating an analytical expression for the relative change that strain induces

in Li3OCl, a prototype member of a promising family of potential solid electrolytes for LIBs

that has received increasing attention in the past few years: the so-called Lithium-Rich

Anti-Perovskites (LiRAPs). [3, 4, 6, 10, 21–35] Such expression was obtained in terms of the

Gibbs energy barriers for Li+ migration, which were evaluated numerically by computational

modeling.

Analytical model and numeric evaluation - The analytical expression for ionic conduc-

tivity σ was calculated according to the hopping model, which can always be used as long

as one knows the crystal structure, all relevant charge carriers, their concentration and the

possible migration paths. Thus, considering the conductivity as [36]

(cid:88)

σ =

ni |qi| µi,

(1)

we used statistical thermodynamics to calculate the concentration ni of each one of the

i

2

charge carriers, whose charges are qi, lying at distinct positions i inside the unit cell at a

temperature T . The mobility µi of each of them is given by [36, 37]

µi =

|qi| νβ
2kBT

(cid:88)

j

(cid:16)−G(m)

(cid:17)

(ρi→j)2 exp

,

(2)

in which we take into account all neighboring positions j to which the carrier can migrate,
these lying at distances (projected at the external applied electric ﬁeld direction) |ρi→j| from
position i. The above expression for mobility is based on the fact that between positions i
and j there is a Gibbs energy migration barrier G(m)

i→j that the charge carrier tries to hop with
attempt frequency ν, having probability of success at each try given by the exponential term.

We highlight that this model has been widely and successfully used both by theoreticians and

experimentalists to replicate, model and explain the ionic transport in crystalline materials.

[36, 38–44]

For a unstrained cubic (anti-)perovskite-structured ABX3 crystal having vacancies of X

ion as charge carriers, the ionic conductivity can be written as [45]

−1 with kB being the Boltzmann constant, ao is the unstrained lattice
is the migration Gibbs energy from one vertex of the BX6 octahedron to

another and n is the amount of X vacancies per unit volume. In doped or non-stoichiometric

crystals this amount usually is strain- and temperature-independent, being deﬁned by the

doping or non-stoichiometry degree, as long as the concentration of thermally activated

charge carriers can be neglected, as usually happens at RT. This is, for example, the case of

Li3OCl antiperovskite, in which the number of thermally activated charge carriers per unit
formula is ∼ 10−7 [25], while the corresponding values due to doping and non-stoichiometry
are > 5 × 10−3 [21, 26] and ∼ 10−2 [3], respectively.

However, if a biaxial stress is applied in the [100] and [010] directions, cubic symmetry

is broken and Eq.

(3) no longer holds. Considering that no octahedral tilt occurs and

all ions remain in their original fractional coordinates relative to the lattice parameters,

the basal plane contraction (compressive stress) or expansion (tensile stress) leads to a

tetragonal structure. Thus, the X ions in planes (001)(in apical positions relative to the BX6

octahedra) and X ions in planes (002) (in equatorial positions relative to the octahedra) are

no longer equivalent by symmetry. This implies that apical and equatorial vacancies will

3

have distinct formation Gibbs energies G(ν)

ap and G(v)

eq , so that ion X vacancies will tend to

concentrate in planes with lowest Gibbs energy. Also, there are now three distinct vacancy

migration paths: (i) equatorial-to-equatorial, (ii) equatorial-to-apical, and (iii) apical-to-
equatorial, with respective migration Gibbs energies G(m)

eq→ap and G(m)

ap→eq (apical-to-

eq→eq, G(m)

apical migration barrier is always large, with negligible contribution to mobility).

This leads to distinction between lateral (i.e., in the same plane of applied stress) and

perpendicular (to the plane of applied stress) conductivities. We noticed strain was always

detrimental to perpendicular transport in Li3OCl (and apparently for perovskites in general),

so here we focus on the lateral conductivity only, which on this case is

where a is the strained lattice parameter parallel to any one of the two equivalent directions

Therefore, to determine the relative increase (or decrease) in Li3OCl’s Li+ conductivity

as a function of biaxial strain, we just need to know how the lattice parameter, as well as

Gibbs energies of formation and migration of Li+ vacancies, depend on strain. Classical

atomistic modelling is a powerful and reliable tool to access defect energetics in energy

materials (including LIB materials) [18, 25, 35, 46–50] and to estimate the eﬀect of strain on

ionic transport.[13, 18, 51–53] Thus, we performed quasi-static calculations based on pair-

wise interionic potentials using the GULP code [54–56] to obtain the lattice parameter and

Li+ vacancies formation and migration Gibbs energies required in Eq. (5) as a function of

tensile biaxial strain for Li3OCl. We adopted a robust, already validated parameterization

previously derived by our group,[25, 31, 35] since the resulting force ﬁeld has the unusual

advantage of allowing the straightforward calculation of Gibbs energies, instead of enthalpies.

This is important because neglecting entropy contributions may lead to uncertainties as large

as one order of magnitude.[13] All parameters in Eq. (5) were calculated at 300 K, since

this is the ideal LIB operation temperature. We also point out that in the range of biaxial

strains investigated (0-6%), the only structural change observed in our calculations was a

4

simple tetragonal distortion, without any octahedral tilts, so that all assumptions leading

to Eq. (5) were satisﬁed.

Ionic conductivity boost and implications for epitaxial ﬁlms - The calculated relative

enhancement in lateral Li+ conductivity as a function of tensile biaxial strain, as shown in

Fig. 1, indicates that a huge conductivity increase, nearly with exponential behavior, can be

achieved with relatively low strains, with the ionic conductivity increasing by over one order

of magnitude at 2% and reaching a two orders of magnitude enhancement already at 3.3%.
Considering that the RT Li+ conductivities of Li3OCl-based polycrystals (10−4−10−3 S/cm)
[3, 5, 21, 27] are among the highest ones reported for crystalline materials, the possibility of

enhancing such values by even 1-2 orders of magnitude is remarkable, since this may improve

signiﬁcantly this electrolyte performance in miniaturized LIBs. We stress that this is the

ﬁrst clear evidence of strain-induced enhancement in ionic transport of a Li+-conducting

solid electrolyte [19]. For completeness sake, we also investigated inﬂuence of tensile biaxial

strain over perpendicular conductivity (not shown here), but it was found to be detrimental.

Also, further calculations for compressive biaxial strains revealed that these are detrimental

not only to perpendicular, but also to lateral transport. A detailed investigation of Li3OCl’s

ionic conductivity dependence on diﬀerent strain states is beyond the scope of this Letter

and will be published elsewhere.

FIG. 1.

(Color online) Ratio between lateral conductivities of strained and unstrained Li3OCl for

a tensile biaxial strain in the directions [100] and [010], calculated from both the full expression,

Eq. (5) (red diamonds), and the simple approximation given by Eq. (9) (blue line).

These ﬁndings have important implications for Li3OCl thin ﬁlms use as solid electrolytes

5

in miniaturized LIBs. The commonest way to obtain a tensile strain is by depositing an epi-

taxial ﬁlm on a substrate whose lattice parameter is larger than that of the ionic conductor.

For Li3OCl, a commercially available substrate which implies a tensile strain around 2% is
K(Ta1−xNbx)O3 (KTN), whose lattice parameter ranges from 3.989 to 4.000 ˚A depending on

Nb concentration. Commonly used substrates as SrTiO3, LaAlO3 and YAlO3 have lattice

parameter lower than Li3OCl and should not imply in a conductivity enhancement if Li3OCl

grows in [001] direction on these substrates. Also, substrates with very larger lattice param-

eter which are almost ao multiples can be used, but in this case the epitaxial deposition is

diﬃcult. Finally, a non-strained thick ﬁlm with the desired lattice parameter can be grown

in a conventional substrate as an intermediated layer to drive a tensile strain in Li3OCl. For
example, Li3OBr (a ∼ 4.045 ˚A) can be used as such intermediate layer, delivering a tensile
strain of ca. 3.5%.

Furthermore, the electrodes should be placed on the sides of the ﬁlm (see Fig. 2), instead

of sandwiching it from below and above, as it is usually performed for perovskites’ epitaxial

growth by sputtering or pulsed laser deposition (PLD), when a conductor perovskite layer, as

SrRuO3, is ﬁrst deposited. It is necessary to use lateral electrodes so that lateral, instead of

perpendicular conductivity, is obtained. This setup has already been successfully employed

to observe a two orders of magnitude enhancement in lateral ionic conductivity at 573 K due

to tensile biaxial strain in a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin ﬁlm deposited on SrTiO3

(STO) substrate. [12] Another possible setup is to place both electrodes on top, instead of on

the sides. This is similar to the setup employed by Garc´ıa-Barriocanal et al. [11] to observe

an eight orders of magnitude enhancement in lateral conductivity of YSZ near RT (357 K)

in YSZ/STO heterostrucures, which has been partially attributed to strain.[13, 57] However,

it has been argued that this later setup may lead to “enormous electrode resistance” [58]

due to the small contact between the electrodes and the system under study, so that the

one presented in Fig. 2 may be more suitable.

Exponential dependence of ionic conductivity on strain - Along with the conductivity

enhancement in itself, its simple exponential dependence on strain is also very interesting

from a physical point of view, once it is not directly obvious from Eq.

(5). Therefore,

we further investigated this dependence, getting helpful physical insights along the way,

as shown next. For tensile strains, the calculated Gibbs energy of formation of equatorial

vacancies was lower than of apical vacancies, as can be seen in Fig. 3(a), so that

ap − G(ν)
G(ν)

eq > 0.

(6)

Also, according to Fig. 3(b), the Gibbs energy barrier for equatorial-to-equatorial migration

is lower than the unstrained counterpart. Thus, for non-zero strain,

eq→eq ≡ G(m)

0 − G(m)

∆G(m)

eq→eq > 0.

(7)

As also shown in Fig. 3(a), the equatorial-to-apical migration barrier is higher than the

unstrained one, since Gibbs energy of formation of an equatorial vacancy decreases faster

with strain than the saddle point Gibbs energy does. For example, for 5%, the contours

show that Gibbs energy of formation of an equatorial vacancy is reduced by more than 0.2

eV, while the saddle point Gibbs energy is reduced by less than 0.2 eV. Accordingly, also

for non-zero strain,

eq→ap − G(m)
G(m)

eq→eq > 0.

(8)

Our calculations showed all these diﬀerences grow almost linearly when strain increases, in

a rate high enough for the corresponding exponentials of the diﬀerences present in Eq. (6)

and in Eq. (8) to become negligible for strains greater than 1%.

In this case, Eq. (5)

reduces simply to

σ
σo

≈ 3
4

eβ∆G(m)

eq→eq ,

(9)

since the variation in the lattice parameter is small compared to the exponential above.

Therefore, for strains greater than 1%, Eq. (9) can provide a great estimate of relative

increase in Li3OCl’s lateral ionic conductivity compared to the full expression, as observed

in Fig.1. Notice Eq.(9) directly explains the nearly exponential behavior obtained, since

7

the dependence of equatorial-to-equatorial Gibbs energy barriers on strain was found to be

almost linear.

Despite this exponential impact of strain over conductivity, it is important to observe that

strain may not be so helpful to increase conduction at high temperatures, once the relative

increase in conductivity has exponential dependence also on the inverse of temperature. This

is consistent with molecular dynamics calculations at very high temperatures on LaGaO3,

where the increase in lateral diﬀusion was small, yet exponential on strain.[53] However,

while performance at high/intermediate temperatures is critical for a potential solid oxide

fuel cell electrolyte such as LaGaO3, the ideal operation temperature of a LIB is RT, so the

fact that conductivity enhancement at higher temperatures may be small is not a problem

for Li3OCl. Besides, its conductivity already increases rapidly to very high values at superior

temperatures, due to its low activation enthalpy.

to-apical and (b) equatorial-to-equatorial migration, obtained from atomistic modelling. The grey

dashed contours provide reference to numeric values of Gibbs energy, while blue ﬁlled lines evidence

the barrier proﬁle for a ﬁxed strain value. Superior insets show snapshots of the relaxed structure

around the migrating Li+ vacancy, with Li+, O2- and Cl- colored cyan, red and blue, respectively,

and blue dashed lined connecting ions to help visualizing structural distortions in relation to the

initial structure (i.e., undistorted and without vacancies).

8

Microscopic insights - Now we turn our attention to the terms present in Eq. (5), but

missing in Eq. (9), since this comparison leads to further insights about the the preferential

migration path and the distribution of vacancies between apical and equatorial sites. First,

we observe that the main feature contributing for the strain-induced enhancement in Li+

conduction is the reduction of equatorial-to-equatorial barrier, without any signiﬁcant inﬂu-

ence from the other two. This can be explained by degeneracy breaking of vacancy formation

Gibbs energy, which splits into two values, one for each plane. On one hand, this split makes

the (001) planes energetically unfavorable for vacancies, so that too few vacancies ( 2% for

strains as low as 1%) are in apical positions for the apical-to-equatorial hopping contribution

to be relevant. On the other hand, it increases Gibbs energy of equatorial-to-apical hop-

ping, once the ground state for migration lowers (more than the saddle point does; see Fig.

3(a)), limiting signiﬁcantly the amount of hops by this route. Therefore, lateral conduction

happens almost exclusively in (002) planes; accordingly, only the migration barrier in these
planes are relevant for strains >∼ 1%.

Second, at ﬁrst sight, the transport in (002) planes is not strongly inﬂuenced by the

drastic increase of equatorial vacancy concentration, once Eq. (9) has no dependence on

the relative formation Gibbs energies. This is intriguing, since the conductivity is linearly

proportional to the charge carriers concentration in each plane and should be very sensitive

to them, as described by Eq. (1). However, a closer look in the statistical distribution of

vacancies over the two planes as a function of strain reveals that the percent of equatorial
vacancies is already ∼98% for strains as low as 1%, being >99% when strain is 1.4%, hence
with only minor increments. Therefore, for strains greater than 1%, the concentration

of equatorial vacancies saturates, reaching a practically constant value. Accordingly, its

contribution to Eq. (9) is also a constant value, embedded in the pre-exponential term.

Further applicability - We highlight that despite the considerations that led to Eq. (9)

did not take into account octahedral tilts, apparently this exponential dependence is also

valid when tilts are present, as in the case of perovskite LaGaO3, for example. It is easy

to verify that our very simple Eq. (9) is able to reproduce with remarkable accuracy the

relative increase in LaGaO3’s lateral transport as obtained by Tealdi and Mustarelli using

molecular dynamics, [53] an approach that is much more computationally expensive and

time consuming than static defect calculations.

We infer that the applicability of Eq.

(9) to (anti)perovskite-structured materials is

9

primarily associated to the reduction in equatorial-to-equatorial migration barrier and to

the strain-induced split of vacancy formation Gibbs energy, and hence reallocation of all

vacancies to equatorial positions already for small strains, instead of other structural features

such as octahedral tilts. More interestingly, such exponential dependence seems to hold

even for structures other than perovskite, such as ﬂuorite, as shown by De Souza et al.

for ceria.[13] Therefore, the exponential dependence appears to have a somewhat general

validity and turns out to be a simple way to estimate the eﬀect of biaxial strain on parallel

conductivity from theoretical values of Gibbs energy barriers or enthalpy barriers, as an

approximation to Gibbs energy when migration entropy does not vary signiﬁcantly with

strain.

Conclusions and perspectives - Summarizing, in this Letter we showed that strain is a

powerful tool to boost RT Li+ conductivity in thin-ﬁlm solid electrolytes for miniaturized

LIBs. We exempliﬁed this by calculating the relative enhancement in ionic conductivity that

biaxial tensile strain can induce in a promising solid electrolyte, Li3OCl, in which a two orders

of magnitude increase was predicted for a 3.3% strain. We also provided practical suggestions

on experimental setup and strategies to observe this eﬀect, which may lead to the larger Li+

conductivity ever reported in a solid electrolyte. We established an analytical expression

for the strain-induced enhancement valid for vacancy migration between octahedra vertices

in perovskite-structured solids in general, so it can also be used to probe the same eﬀect
in a wide range of other O2−, Li+ and Na+ conductors candidates for solid electrolytes in
fuel cells or alkali-metal-ion batteries, such as perovskite oxides, [53] other LiRAPs and also

NaRAPs (Na-Rich Anti-Perovskites) [59, 60]. Finally, the approach used here can also be

scaled for more complex structures other than perovskite.
