A PRIORI BOUNDS AND GLOBAL BIFURCATION RESULTS FOR

FREQUENCY COMBS MODELED BY THE LUGIATO-LEFEVER

EQUATION

RAINER MANDEL AND WOLFGANG REICHEL

Abstract. In nonlinear optics 2π-periodic solutions a ∈ C 2([0, 2π]; C) of the stationary
Lugiato-Lefever equation −da(cid:48)(cid:48) = (i − ζ)a + |a|2a − if serve as a model for frequency combs,
which are optical signals consisting of a superposition of modes with equally spaced fre-
quencies. We prove that nontrivial frequency combs can only be observed for special values
of the forcing and detuning parameters f and ζ, as it has been previously documented in
experiments and numerical simulations. E.g., if the detuning parameter ζ is too large then
nontrivial frequency combs do not exist, cf. Theorem 2. Additionally, we show that for large
ranges of parameter values nontrivial frequency combs may be found on continua which bifur-
cate from curves of trivial frequency combs. Our results rely on the proof of a priori bounds
for the stationary Lugiato-Lefever equation as well as a detailed rigorous bifurcation analy-
sis based on the bifurcation theorems of Crandall-Rabinowitz and Rabinowitz. We use the
software packages AUTO and MATLAB to illustrate our results by numerical computations
of bifurcation diagrams and of selected solutions.

1. Introduction

amplitude of the k-th mode of the signal in the frequency domain and let a(x) =(cid:80)

In physics literature an optical signal is called a frequency comb if it consists of a super-
position of modes with equally spaced frequencies. By a suitable choice of reference frame a
frequency comb becomes stationary (time-independent). For k ∈ Z let ˆak denote the complex
k∈Z ˆakeikx
be the associated Fourier series. A commonly used mathematical model is given by the
stationary Lugiato-Lefever equation

where the parameters satisfy d (cid:54)= 0 and ζ, f ∈ R and a(x, t) = a1(x)+ia2(x), i.e., a is split into
its real and imaginary part. Derivations of (1.1) may be found, e.g., in [2, 11]. More details
on the physical background and the meaning of the parameters are given in Section 1.2.

with added damping and forcing. Our analysis and our results are based on the investigation
of (1.1) from the point of view of bifurcation from trivial (i.e. spatially constant) solutions.

1.1. Mathematical context and main results. One ﬁrst notices that (1.1) has trivial,
i.e.
spatially constant, solutions. They correspond to vanishing amplitudes of all modes
except the 0-mode and are described in detail in Lemma 5 below. Stable, spatially periodic
patterns bifurcating from trivial solutions of (1.1) were already observed in [17]. Recently, a
more far-reaching bifurcation analysis appeared in [8], where the diﬀerential equation in (1.1)
is considered as a four-dimensional dynamical system in the unknowns a1, a(cid:48)
2. As the
parameters f and ζ change, the trivial solutions exhibit various bifurcation phenomena. This
approach allows an extensive account of various possible types of solutions of the diﬀerential
equations in (1.1). However, with this approach the 2π-periodicity of the solutions may be
lost. An emanating solution with spatial period τ has to be rescaled to the ﬁxed period 2π
and as a result (1.1) is changed, e.g., d becomes (2π)2d/τ 2. A diﬀerent view on bifurcation
has been developed in [18]. Here spatially 2π-periodic solutions of (1.1) are considered via
a bifurcation approach using the center manifold reduction. The resulting picture is very
detailed in the vicinity of special parameter values but beyond these values nothing seems to
be known – a gap in the literature which we would like to ﬁll with the present paper.

1, a2, a(cid:48)

Similarly to the above-mentioned papers we use bifurcation theory to prove the existence
of frequency combs bifurcating from the set of spatially constant solutions. Let us therefore
point out the main features which distinguish our approach from the previous ones. Unlike [8]
we consider (1.1) on certain spaces of 2π-periodic functions. We obtain a very rich bifurcation
picture which is not limited to local considerations as in [8,18]. In Theorem 1 and Theorem 2
we ﬁnd a priori bounds and uniqueness results which allow us to show that

(a) nonconstant solutions of (1.1) only occur in the range sign(d)ζ ∈ [ζ∗, ζ∗],
(b) nonconstant solutions of (1.1) satisfy (cid:107)a(cid:107)∞ + |ζ| ≤ C.

Here, the values ζ∗, ζ∗ and C are explicit and only depend on the parameters f, d. We begin
with our results concerning pointwise a priori bounds for solutions of (1.1) in terms of the
parameters ζ, d, f .
Theorem 1. Let d (cid:54)= 0, f, ζ ∈ R. Every solution a ∈ C 2([0, 2π], R2) of (1.1) satisﬁes

(1.2)

where

(1.3)

|f|(1 + 12π2f 2|d|−1)

max{1,−ζ sign(d) − γ(d, f )},

(cid:107)a(cid:107)L∞ ≤

(cid:26) 36π2f 4|d|−1,

γ(d, f ) :=

d > 0,
36π2f 4|d|−1 + f 2(1 + 12π2f 2|d|−1)2, d < 0.

Remark. Further bounds in L2([0, 2π], R2) and H 1([0, 2π], R2) may be extracted from the
proof of this theorem.

In our second result we employ Theorem 1 to show that the set of nonconstant solutions

is bounded with respect to ζ.

3

Theorem 2. Let d (cid:54)= 0, f ∈ R, ζ ∈ R and let ζ∗, ζ∗ be given by

√

ζ∗ := −γ(d, f ) −
ζ∗ := 6f 2(1 + 12π2f 2|d|−1)2.

6|f|(1 + 12π2f 2|d|−1),

Then every solution of (1.1) is constant provided sign(d)ζ < ζ∗ or sign(d)ζ > ζ∗.

Next we consider (1.1) from the point of view of bifurcation theory where one of the two
values f or ζ is ﬁxed and the other one is the bifurcation parameter. According to the two
possible choices we identify two curves of constant solutions: ˆΓf with f being ﬁxed and
¯Γζ with ζ ﬁxed, see Lemma 5 for explicit parametrizations of these curves. We investigate
branches of nontrivial solutions that bifurcate from the trivial branches ˆΓf and ¯Γζ and obtain
information about their global shape. In our approach we consider the following special class
of solutions of (1.1). We call them synchronized solutions in order to emphasize that they
have a particular shape.
Deﬁnition. A 2π-periodic solution a ∈ C 2([0, 2π]; C) of (1.1) is called synchronized if a(cid:48)(0) =
a(cid:48)(π) = 0.

Synchronized solutions are even around x = 0 and x = π. The advantage of considering
synchronized solutions is that the translation invariance of the original equation (1.1) is no
longer present in this Neumann boundary value problem which makes the bifurcation analysis
much easier, see also the remark after Proposition 10.

Before we state our results let us recall some common notions in bifurcation theory. In
the context of bifurcation from ˆΓf (Theorem 3) a pair (a, ζ) is called a trivial solution if it
is spatially constant, i.e., if (a, ζ) lies on ˆΓf . A trivial solution (a, ζ) is called a bifurcation
point if a sequence (ak, ζk)k∈N of non-trivial solutions of the periodic system (1.1) converges
to (a, ζ). Similarly trivial solutions and bifurcation points are deﬁned when bifurcation from
¯Γζ is investigated, see Theorem 4. Since our analysis of synchronized solutions is based on the
bifurcation theorem of Crandall-Rabinowitz [4] such bifurcating non-trivial solutions lie on
local curves around the bifurcation points. Furthermore, we will use the global bifurcation
theorem of Rabinowitz [20] to show that these curves are part of a connected set that is
unbounded or returns to the curve of trivial solutions at some other point. A continuum
satisfying one of these two properties will be a called global continuum. If, additionally, the
nontrivial (i.e. nonconstant) solutions from this continuum are conﬁned in a bounded subset
of L∞([0, 2π], R2) × R then the continuum will be called bounded.

For ﬁxed f ∈ R we ﬁnd that at most ﬁnitely many global continua bifurcate from ˆΓf .
These continua are bounded and intersect ˆΓf at another trivial solution. For the reader’s
convenience this is illustrated in the plots of Figures 9–14. The result reads as follows.
Theorem 3. Let d (cid:54)= 0, f ∈ R. If |f| < 1 then the curve ˆΓf does not contain any bifurcation
point for (1.1). In case |f| ≥ 1 the following holds:

4

RAINER MANDEL AND WOLFGANG REICHEL

(i) All bifurcation points are among the points (ˆa1(t), ˆa2(t), ˆζ(t)) where the number t ∈

(ii) The curve ˆΓf contains at most ˆk(f ) bifurcation points for (1.1) where

(iii) If in addition to (1.4) one has

(S) −k2 + 2d−1(f 2(1 − t2) − t(1 − t2)−1/2) (cid:54)= j2 for all j ∈ N0 \ {k},
(T) 4f 6t3(1 − t2)2 + f 4(1 − t2)1/2 − 2tf 2 − (1 − t2)−3/2

(cid:16)
4f 4t3(1 − t2) + f 2(2t2 − 1)(1 − t2)−1/2(cid:17) (cid:54)= 0
−σ(cid:112)f 4(1 − t2)2 − 1

then a global continuum containing nontrivial synchronized solutions emanates from
(ˆa1(t), ˆa2(t), ˆζ(t)). This continuum is bounded and it returns to ˆΓf at some other
point.

Remark. The statement that emanating branches must return to the family of constant
solutions at some other point follows from Rabinowitz’ global bifurcation theorem [20] and
the fact that all nonconstant solutions (a, ζ) of (1.1) satisfy (cid:107)a(cid:107)∞ +|ζ| ≤ C for some positive
number C depending only the parameters f, d, cf. Theorem 1 and 2.

Now let us state the corresponding result for the bifurcation analysis associated to the
family of trivial solutions ¯Γζ for given ζ ∈ R. In contrast to the above results we ﬁnd that
inﬁnitely many global continua emanate from ¯Γζ in the case d > 0 whereas for d < 0 again
only ﬁnitely many such continua can exist. The numerical plots from Figures 1–8 illustrate
our results. Although we do not have a proof for the boundedness of the continua in this
case, it seems nevertheless plausible in view of the numerical plots.
Theorem 4. Let d (cid:54)= 0, ζ ∈ R.

(i) All bifurcation points on the curve ¯Γζ are among (¯a1(s), ¯a2(s), ¯f (s)) where

(cid:112)(ζ + dk2)2 − 3) (cid:54)= j2 for all j ∈ N0 \ {k},

(cid:112)(ζ + dk2)2 − 3 (cid:54)= 0 and

then a global continuum containing synchronized nontrivial solutions bifurcates from
(¯a1(s), ¯a2(s), ¯f (s)).

5

Remarks. (1) In principle the exceptional points where the conditions (S) and (T) are
not satisﬁed could be analyzed using diﬀerent bifurcation theorems. Suitable candidates
for a bifurcation theorem in the presence of higher-dimensional kernels are the theorems of
Healey, Kielh¨ofer, Kr¨omer [15] and Westreich [22]. Bifurcation results without transversality
condition can be found in [16]. However, the required amount of calculations are far too
high to justify the use of these theorems. For the same reason we did not include a detailed
analysis of the initial directions of the bifurcation branches which, without any theoretical
diﬃculty, may be calculated using the formulas from section I.6 in Kielh¨ofer’s book [13].

(2) It would be interesting to ﬁnd out whether (1.1) admits solutions which are not syn-
chronized. Note that in the case of scalar periodic boundary value problems the restriction
to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on an interval of half the period is natural
since (up to a shift) all solutions satisfy this condition. However, in the system case this is
not clear at all.

1.2. Frequency combs in physics and engineering. Currently frequency combs are gain-
ing interest as optical sources for high-speed data transmission where the individual comb
lines are used as carriers. A high power per combline with the same spectral power dis-
tribution is important. An experimental set-up for such frequency combs is given by a
microresonator which is coupled to an optical waveguide under the inﬂuence of a single,
strong, external laser source that is tuned to a resonance wavelength of the device. Inside the
resonator the optical intensity is strongly enhanced and modes start to interact in a nonlinear
way. As a consequence, the primarily excited mode couples with a multitude of neighbor-
ing modes. This leads to a cascaded transfer of power from the pump to the comb lines.
Under suitable choice of parameters, a stationary cascade of excited modes can be obtained
and results in a stable frequency comb with equidistant spectral lines. If ˆak(t) denotes the
dimensionless complex-valued amplitude of the k-th mode in the microresonator at time t
then, following [2, 11], it satisﬁes the following set of coupled diﬀerential equations

(1.6) i∂tˆak(t) = (−i + ζ)ˆak(t) + dk2ˆak(t) − (cid:88)

ˆak(cid:48)(t)ˆak(cid:48)(cid:48)(t)ˆak(cid:48)+k(cid:48)(cid:48)−k(t) + iδ0kf,

k ∈ Z.

k(cid:48),k(cid:48)(cid:48)∈Z

In this equation, the parameters ζ, d, f are real and t is normalized time. The term iδ0kf
corresponds to forcing by the external pump, ζ represents the normalized frequency detuning
between the source and the principal resonance of the microresonator, and d quantiﬁes the
dispersion in the system. The case d < 0 corresponds to normal dispersion whereas d > 0
is called the anomalous regime, cf. [8]. The loss of power due to radiation and waveguide
coupling is modeled by the damping term −iˆak(t). In the literature a stationary solution of
(1.6) is called a frequency comb.

Via the Fourier series a(x, t) =(cid:80)

k∈Z ˆak(t)eikx frequency combs can equally be deﬁned as
xa(x, t) − |a(x, t)|2a(x, t) + if,

i∂ta(x, t) = (−i + ζ)a(x, t) − d∂2

It was originally proposed in [17] as a model for the envelope of a ﬁeld transmitted through
a nonlinearly responding optical cavity. It resembles a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation with

6

RAINER MANDEL AND WOLFGANG REICHEL

added damping and forcing. Stationary solutions of (1.7) of the form a = a1 + ia2 correspond
to solutions (a1, a2) of (1.1).

The experimental generation of frequency combs in microresonators has been demonstrated
many times, cf. the review paper [14]. One of the ﬁrst demonstrations [6] used a toroidal
fused-silica microresonator. In [11] the dynamics of the Kerr comb formation process is ex-
perimentally explored and found to be independent of the resonator material system and
geometry. One of the ﬁrst theoretical papers [2] marks the starting point for a series of
subsequent investigations and publications.
In this paper a numerical simulation of Kerr
frequency combs is given based on (1.6), i.e., the modal expansion of the ﬁelds. A consider-
able computational eﬀort is needed to handle the multitude of coupled diﬀerential equations.
Nevertheless, a detailed account of the temporal dynamics is supplied and analytical expres-
sions (approximations) of the distance of primary comb lines in terms of resonator and pump
parameters are derived.

As one can see in Section 5 there a many diﬀerent shapes of frequency combs. Of partic-
ular interest are so-called soliton combs. These are stationary solutions of (1.7) which are
highly localized in space. Accordingly their frequency spectrum shows many densely spaced
comb lines; cf. Figures 8 and 14. Moreover, the power of the k-th excited frequency in a
soliton comb is much higher than the k-th excited frequency in a comb with sparse frequency
spectrum, cf. Figure 3 and 4. Since these properties of soliton combs are very desirable for
high-speed data transmission, they received attention in recent literature. In [3] a numerical
study of pump and resonator parameters and their eﬀect on the bandwidth of Kerr combs
was performed, and ﬁrst indications appeared that soliton combs can only be achieved by
a special tuning of the pump parameters. According to the simulations presented in [7]
these solitons show a high coherence along with a high number of comb lines with ﬂat power
distribution. The ﬁrst experimental proof of soliton combs was done in [10]. The eﬀect of
higher order dispersion terms is the topic of [19]. It is shown that incorporating third-order
dispersion terms into the model enlarges the parameter ranges where stable soliton combs
exist. In [21] the eﬀect of higher order dispersion on the comb shape is discussed.

1.3. Further mathematical results. A rigorous study of the time-dependent problem (1.7)
both from the analytical and from the numerical point of view was recently given in [12].
Applying Theorem 2.1 of [12] to the function a(x, t)eiζt one obtains that for d = 1 and initial
per([0, 2π]; C) the initial value problem associated to (1.7) admits a unique
data lying in H 4

1.4. Structure of the paper. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide the
functional analytical framework for our analysis. This includes an appropriate choice of the
function spaces and corresponding solution concepts. In Section 3 the proofs of Theorem 1
(a priori bounds) and Theorem 2 (uniqueness) are given. The proofs of the bifurcation results
from Theorem 3 and 4 can be found in Section 4. Section 5 contains illustrations with tables
of bifurcation points, bifurcation diagrams and plots of approximate solutions. In the ﬁnal
Section 6 we draw conclusions from our results and formulate some open questions.

1.5. On the generation of the numerical plots. The illustrations in Section 5 were
created with the software package AUTO. It is a free software which determines bifurcation
points, approximations of solutions and generates bifurcation diagrams. It can be downloaded
from indy.cs.concordia.ca/auto/. We postprocessed the outupt of AUTO by a MATLAB
program to improve the quality of the approximated solutions of (1.1) via several Newton it-
erations and to compute the Fourier coeﬃcients of the improved approximated solutions. The
MATLAB program also produces .pdf ﬁles of plotted solutions and their Fourier coeﬃcients.
A .zip ﬁle containing a README-description and driver ﬁles for the code can be downloaded
freely from www.waves.kit.edu/downloads/CRC1173 Preprint 2016-7 supplement.zip.
By running the driver ﬁles AUTO and MATLAB will be invoked and generate all plots
of this paper.

2. Mathematical setup

First we describe the spaces of solutions in which our analysis works. A weak solution
a ∈ H 1([0, 2π]; R2) of (1.1) will be called a solution for the sake of simplicity. Notice that every
such solution coincides almost everywhere with a smooth classical solution of the equation
so that regularity issues will not play a role in the sequel and all solution concepts in fact
coincide. In the context of Theorems 1 and 2 it is convenient to consider 2π-periodic classical
per([0, 2π]; R2) will be useful. In the context
solutions. For the proof of Theorem 2 the space H 2
of the bifurcation results of Theorems 3 and 4 we consider synchronized solutions of (1.1),
i.e. solutions that satisfy additionally a(cid:48)(0) = a(cid:48)(π) = 0. If we set H := H 1([0, π], R2) then
a = (a1, a2) is a synchronized solution of (1.1) if and only if a = (a1, a2) ∈ H satisﬁes

for all ϕ1 ∈ H,
for all ϕ2 ∈ H.

A synchronized solution can be extended evenly around x = π and thus produce a 2π-periodic
function. This weak setting in the Hilbert space H will be convenient for the proof of the
bifurcation results.

Next we describe the trivial (i.e. spatially constant) solutions of (1.1). In order to obtain
a global parameterization of the solution curves some new auxiliary parameters t resp. s will
be used instead of ζ resp. f . The totality of constant solutions is given next.

Lemma 5. Let d (cid:54)= 0 be ﬁxed.

(a) Let f ∈ R be given. Then the set of constant solutions (a1, a2, ζ) of (1.1) is given by

ˆΓf = {(ˆa1(t), ˆa2(t), ˆζ(t)) : |t| < 1} where
ˆa1(t) = f (1 − t2),

√
ˆa2(t) = −f t

1 − t2,

ˆζ(t) = f 2(1 − t2) +

t√

.

(b) Let ζ ∈ R be given. Then the set of constant solutions (a1, a2, f ) of (1.1) is given by

¯Γζ = {(¯a1(s), ¯a2(s), ¯f (s)) : s ∈ R} where

s(cid:112)1 + (s2 − ζ)2

¯a1(s) =

¯a2(s) =

s(s2 − ζ)

(cid:112)1 + (s2 − ζ)2

,

¯f (s) = s(cid:112)1 + (s2 − ζ)2.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst show that every constant solution a = (a1, a2) ∈ R2 ⊂ H of (1.1) satisﬁes

(2.1)

f 2 = |a|2(1 + (|a|2 − ζ)2).

Indeed, for constant solutions (1.1) can be written as

(cid:18)|a|2 − ζ

and hence by inverting the matrix

(2.2)

Taking the Euclidean norm on both sides of the equation gives (2.1).

Now let us prove (a), so let f ∈ R be given and deﬁne t ∈ (−1, 1) via t(1−t2)−1/2 = ζ−|a|2.

Then (2.1) implies

and hence

ζ − t(1 − t2)−1/2 = |a|2 =

f 2

1 + t2(1 − t2)−1 = f 2(1 − t2)

ζ = f 2(1 − t2) +

t√

.

From the linear system (2.2) and the deﬁnition of t we obtain the desired formulas for a1, a2.

In order to prove (b) let ζ ∈ R and set s := sign(f )|a|. Then we have

hence f = s(cid:112)1 + (s2 − ζ)2.

f 2 = s2(1 + (s2 − ζ)2),

From the linear system (2.2) and this formula for s we obtain the result.

3. Proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2

We always assume d (cid:54)= 0 and f, ζ ∈ R. We write (cid:107) · (cid:107)p for the standard norm on

Lp([0, 2π]; R2) for p ∈ [1,∞].

Proof of Theorem 1: We divide the proof into several steps.

−ζ sign(d) − γ(d, f ) > 0. This completes the proof of Theorem 1. The L2-estimate from
Step 4 entails, just as in Step 3, that there exists some x1 ∈ [0, 2π] such that |a(x1)| ≤
(−ζ sign(d) − γ(d, f ))−1|f| and the claim follows from

This proves the bounded invertibility of Ld,ζ as well as the norm estimate for Id◦L−1

In the ﬁrst case, where sign(d)ζ > ζ∗ > 0, Theorem 1 gives, by choice of ζ∗,

In this section we prove the bifurcation results for the Lugiato-Lefever equation (1.1).
We will always assume that d (cid:54)= 0 is ﬁxed. As explained earlier our suﬃcient conditions for
bifurcation from constant solutions of (1.1) will be established in the context of the Neumann

(4.1)

In this way the shift-invariance of the general 2π-periodic system is circumvented. Using the
notation introduced in the introduction we will ﬁnd the existence of synchronized solution
branches bifurcating from the curves of constant solutions.

Let us now shortly outline how our bifurcation analysis is organized. In Section 4.1 we
ﬁrst provide a functional analytical framework for solutions of (4.1). The construction of
solutions is done with the help of the bifurcation theorem due to Crandall and Rabinowitz
(Theorem 7). In Theorem 3, the family of trivial solutions will be ˆΓf for ﬁxed f ∈ R and
in Theorem 4 it will be ¯Γζ for ﬁxed ζ ∈ R. The proof of these theorems is accomplished
in four steps. In Section 4.2 we ﬁrst determine the candidates for the bifurcation points of
(1.1) with respect to ˆΓf , ¯Γζ proving Theorem 3(i), Theorem 4(i). This result will be used
in Section 4.3 to establish the upper bounds for the number of bifurcation points claimed
in Theorem 3(ii) and Theorem 4(ii). In order to prove the existence of bifurcating branches
it remains to check the hypotheses of the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem in the context of
the Neumann boundary value problem (4.1).
In Section 4.4 we show that the kernels at
the possible bifurcation points (calculated in Section 4.2) are simple if the conditions (S)
from the respective theorem holds.
In the same way the transversality condition will be
veriﬁed in Section 4.5 supposing that condition (T) holds. Hence, a direct application of
Theorem 7 establishes the existence of local curves containing nontrivial solutions of (4.1)
that emanate from ˆΓf , ¯Γζ respectively. Moreover, the a priori bounds for a from Theorem 1
and the uniqueness result from Theorem 2 tell us that for any given f ∈ R the continua
emanating from ˆΓf must be bounded with respect to both variables a, ζ so that Rabinowitz’
global bifurcation theorem [20] yields that each continuum returns to ˆΓf at another point.
Hence, part (iii) of Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 is shown and the proof is complete.

In order to prove bifurcation results from the family of constant solutions of (4.1) let us recall
the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem.
Theorem 7 (Crandall-Rabinowitz [4]). Let I ⊂ R be an open interval and let F : H×I → H
be twice continuously diﬀerentiable such that F (0, λ) = 0 for all λ ∈ I and such that Fx(0, λ0)
is an index-zero Fredholm operator for λ0 ∈ I. Moreover assume:
(H1) there is ϕ ∈ H, ϕ (cid:54)= 0 such that ker(Fx(0, λ0)) = span{ϕ},
(H2) (cid:104)Fxλ(0, λ0)[ϕ], ϕ∗(cid:105)H (cid:54)= 0 where ker(Fx(0, λ0)∗) = span{ϕ∗}.
Then there exists  > 0 and a continuously diﬀerentiable curve (x, λ) : (−, ) → H × R with
λ(0) = λ0, x(0) = 0, x(cid:48)(0) = ϕ and x(t) (cid:54)= 0 for 0 < |t| <  and F (x(t), λ(t)) = 0 for all
t ∈ (−, ). Moreover, there exists a neighbourhood U × J ⊂ H × I of (0, λ0) such that all
nontrivial solutions in U × J of F (x, λ) = 0 lie on the curve.

In the proof of Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 we will apply Theorem 7 to the functions

ˆF : H × (−1, 1) → H and ¯F : H × R → H given by

(4.3)

ˆF (b, t) := G(b + ˆa(t), ˆζ(t), f ),
¯F (b, s) := G(b + ¯a(s), ζ, ¯f (s)),

b ∈ H, t ∈ (−1, 1),
b ∈ H, s ∈ R

where the trivial solution curves (ˆa(t), ˆζ(t)) respectively (¯a(s), ζ(s)) are taken from Lemma 5.
Checking the assumptions of Theorem 7 requires the calculation of the derivatives of ˆF , ¯F at
the trivial solutions. The necessary preparations are made in the following proposition.
Proposition 8. Let a ∈ H, ζ, f ∈ R and let the 2 × 2-matrices N (a, ζ), M1(a), M2(a) be
given by

This implies that ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) is nontrivial if and only if the determinant of one of
these matrices vanishes. Calculating det(dk2 Id−N (a, ζ)) for all k ∈ N0 we obtain that
ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) is nontrivial if and only if there is a solution k ∈ N0 of (4.6). In that case the
kernel of dk2 Id−N (a, ζ) is spanned by the vector ϕk(a) given by (4.7) which proves the for-
mula for ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) from (4.4). A similar calculation shows that ϕ∗ ∈ ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )∗)
satisﬁes −dϕ∗(cid:48)(cid:48) = N (a, ζ)T ϕ∗ in (0, π) and ϕ∗(cid:48)(0) = ϕ∗(cid:48)(π) = 0. From this the formula (4.5)
(cid:3)
for ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )∗) follows as above.
Since for every given ζ, f ∈ R equation (4.6) has at most two diﬀerent solutions k1, k2 ∈ N0
In the following

we know that the spaces ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) are at most two-dimensional.
proposition we single out those parameters for which we have one-dimensional kernels.

Proposition 10. Let ζ, f, a be chosen as in Proposition 9 such that (4.6) holds for some
k ∈ N0. Then ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) and ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )∗) are one-dimensional if and only if

−k2 + d−1(4|a|2 − 2ζ) (cid:54)= j2

for all j ∈ N0 \ {k}.

Proof. Let ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) contain two linearly independent nontrivial vectors. Proposition 9
then implies that equation (4.6) has a second solution j ∈ N0 which gives

(ζ + dk2)2 − 4(ζ + dk2)|a|2 = (ζ + dj2)2 − 4(ζ + dj2)|a|2

and ζ + dk2 (cid:54)= ζ + dj2.

From this we infer 2ζ + dk2 + dj2 = 4|a|2 or equivalently

−k2 + d−1(4|a|2 − 2ζ) = j2

for some j ∈ N0 \ {k}.

Vice versa, by (4.4), this condition implies that ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) is two-dimensional and the
(cid:3)
result follows.

Remark. The applicability of the Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem relies on the simplicity of
the kernel of the linearized equation, which we will check using Proposition 10. In the setting
of 2π-periodic functions simplicity of the kernel of the linearized equation never holds. This
can be seen as follows: First notice that (4.6), which is a necessary condition for bifurcation for
the Neumann problem (4.1), is also a necessary condition for bifurcation for the 2π-periodic
problem (1.1). The proof from above only needs small changes: the operator Dϕ := (−|d|ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48)
1 +
ϕ1,−|d|ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48)
2 + ϕ2), now equipped with periodic boundary conditions on [0, 2π], has a compact
inverse D−1 : Hper → Hper where Hper denotes the restriction of 2π-periodic functions from
H 1(R; R2) to the interval (0, 2π). Furthermore, in the Fourier series expansion (4.9) the terms
˜αk sin(kx) with vectors ˜αk ∈ R2 additionally occur. The vanishing of det(dk2 Id−N (a, ζ))
then appears in the same way as a necessary condition for the nontrivial solvability of the
linear equation −dϕ(cid:48)(cid:48) = N (a, ζ)ϕ by a 2π-periodic function ϕ. However, with ak cos(kx)
belonging to the ker(Ga(a, ζ, f )) for some k ∈ N also ak sin(kx) belongs to the kernel making
it at least two-dimensional. This is one of the reasons why we chose to consider synchronized
solutions rather than periodic solutions.

4.2. Determination of all possible bifurcation points.

First let us mention that the solutions of (4.6) for k = 0 do not give rise to bifurcation from
ˆΓf , ¯Γζ regardless of whether the assumptions (S),(T) are satisﬁed. This is not in contradiction
with the Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem for the following reason. In our analysis we use the
parameterizations of ˆΓf , ¯Γζ from Lemma 5 having the property that t (cid:55)→ ˆζ(t), s (cid:55)→ ¯f (s) may
not be injective for some parameter samples. In our bifurcation analysis related to k = 0
this inconvenience leads to a false prediction of bifurcation in the following way. In order to
keep the explanations short we explain the situation only for the bifurcation analysis related
to ˆΓf . Since we use t (and not ζ) as the parameter in the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem we
ﬁnd a bifurcating branch w.r.t. t whenever (4.6) as well as (S) and (T) are satisﬁed for some
k ∈ N0 and some t0 ∈ (−1, 1). One can check that in the special case k = 0 this is equivalent
to saying that the curve ˆζ has a turning point at t0, i.e. we have ˆζ(cid:48)(t0) = 0, ˆζ(cid:48)(cid:48)(t0) (cid:54)= 0.
As a consequence, for any given ε close enough to 0 there is a value δε converging to 0
as ε → 0 such that δε · ε < 0 and ˆζ(t0 + ε) = ˆζ(t0 + δε). Hence the bifurcation theorem
detects the branch (t0 + ε, ˆa(t0 + δε)) bifurcating from (t0 + , ˆa(t0 + )) at  = 0. Clearly,
(ˆζ(t0 + ε), ˆa(t0 + δε)) = (ˆζ(t0 + δε), ˆa(t0 + δε)) still lies on ˆΓf and so this branch bifurcates
with respect to the variable t, but not with respect to the variable ζ.

For that reason the case k = 0 will be left aside when we determine the possible bifurcation
points. Note that this phenomenon could be avoided if we locally parameterized the trivial
solution families ˆΓf by ζ. However, since this parameterization is in general not global further
technical complications would arise.

In Theorem 3: For given f ∈ R we have to determine all t ∈ (−1, 1) such that ˆFa(0, t) =
Ga(ˆa(t), ˆζ(t), f ) has a nontrivial kernel. According to Proposition 9 this is the case if and
only if there is k ∈ N0 such that
(4.10)
In particular this implies 1 ≤ |ˆa(t)|2 = f 2(1− t2) (see Lemma 5) so that |f| ≥ 1 is a necessary
condition for bifurcation from ˆΓf . Furthermore, in case |f| ≥ 1, we obtain from the formulas
for ˆa(t), ˆζ(t) (see Lemma 5) and (4.10)

(ˆζ(t) + dk2 − 2|ˆa(t)|2)2 = |ˆa(t)|4 − 1.

and dk2 = f 2(1 − t2) −

In Theorem 4: Now let ζ ∈ R be ﬁxed. Proposition 9 and |¯a(s)|2 = s2 imply that the

operator ¯Fa(0, s) = Ga(¯a(s), ζ, ¯f (s)) has a nontrivial kernel if and only if

(ζ + dk2 − 2s2)2 = s4 − 1.

This implies (ζ + dk2)2 ≥ 3 and s2 = 2
From the nonnegativity of s2 we infer ζ + dk2 ≥ 0 and thus ζ + dk2 ≥ √
by the formula (1.5) for σ1, σ2 ∈ {−1, 1} and part (i) of Theorem 4 is proved.

4.3. Number of bifurcation points.

In Theorem 3: We have to prove that for all f ∈ R the trivial solution family ˆΓf contains
at most ˆk(f ) bifurcation points where ˆk(f ) was deﬁned in Theorem 3 (ii). By Proposition 9
every bifurcation point (a, ζ) ∈ ˆΓf satisﬁes the quadratic equation (4.6) for some k ∈ N.
Hence every k gives rise to at most two bifurcation points and therefore it suﬃces to prove
2k ≤ ˆk(f ). Formula (4.6) implies

0 ≤ (ζ + dk2 − 2|a|2)2 = |a|4 − 1.

This shows that bifurcation can only occur if |a| ≥ 1 and together with (2.1) from the
Appendix we get

Substituting ζ from (4.6) we obtain ζ + dk2 − 2|a|2 = ±(cid:112)|a|4 − 1 and thus
|d|k2 ≤(cid:12)(cid:12)dk2 − |a|2 ∓(cid:112)|a|4 − 1(cid:12)(cid:12) + |a|2 +(cid:112)|a|4 − 1

and f 2 ≥ 1 + (|a|2 − ζ)2.

f 2 ≥ |a|2

f 4 − 1.
From this inequality we directly conclude 2k ≤ ˆk(f ).

f 2 − 1 + f 2 +

In Theorem 4: Let ζ ∈ R. Arguing as above we ﬁnd that every bifurcation point (a, ζ) ∈ ¯Γf
satisﬁes equation (1.5) for some k ∈ N, σ1, σ2 ∈ {−1, 1} and hence gives rise to at most four
bifurcation points. Therefore we have to prove 4k ≤ ¯k(ζ) in case d < 0. Indeed, in that case

to show.

4.4. Simplicity of the kernels.

In Theorem 3: Let f ∈ R and let (ˆa(t), ˆζ(t)) be a possible bifurcation point with respect
to ˆΓf , i.e., we assume that t ∈ (−1, 1) satisﬁes equation (1.4) for some k ∈ N and some
σ ∈ {−1, 1}. Then Proposition 10 implies that ker( ˆFa(0, t)) is one-dimensional if and only if
we have

(4.11)

− k2 + d−1(4|ˆa(t)|2 − 2ˆζ(t)) /∈ (N0 \ {k})2.

Since we know from Lemma 5(a) that

4|ˆa(t)|2 − 2ˆζ(t) = 2f 2(1 − t2) − 2t(1 − t2)−1/2

(4.11) is guaranteed by condition (S) of Theorem 3 (iii) and we are done.

(cid:3)
In Theorem 4: Let ζ ∈ R and let (¯a(s), ¯f (s)) be a possible bifurcation point with respect
to ¯Γζ, i.e., we assume that s is given by (1.5) for some k ∈ N, σ1, σ2 ∈ {−1, 1}. As above,
Lemma 5(b) implies the equation

4.5. Transversality condition.

In the calculations related to the veriﬁcation of the transversality condition we will use
the following short-hand notations. In the context of Theorem 3 where (t, k) is a solution of
(1.4) we write

a = (ˆa1(t), ˆa2(t)),

ζ = ˆζ(t),

˙a =

dˆa2

˙ζ =

and in the context of Theorem 4 where (s, k) is a solution of (1.5) we write

f = ¯f (s),

Furthermore we will use

ϕ(x) := ϕk(a)(x) = α cos(kx), ϕ∗(x) := ϕ∗

k(a)(x) = β cos(kx),

where the vectors α = αk, β = βk ∈ R2 were deﬁned in (4.7), (4.8). We have to check the
transversality condition in the possible bifurcation points that we determined in Section 4.2.
Hence we may use (4.6), i.e.,

(ζ + dk2)2 − 4(ζ + dk2)|a|2 + 1 + 3|a|4 = 0.

In view of the formulas (4.7) and (4.8) we will have to investigate the following cases:

Case (1): |a1a2| (cid:54)= 1
Case (2): a1a2 = 1
Case (3): a1a2 = − 1

Figure 1. Bifurcation points on trivial branch.

There are inﬁnitely many branches bifurcating
from the trivial one. Four diﬀerent branches (red,
green, blue, black) are shown in the bifurcation di-
agram. For graphical reasons log((cid:107)a(cid:107)H 1) is shown
instead of (cid:107)a(cid:107)H 1. We observe that all four depicted
branches return to the trivial one. However, there
is no proof of such a statement in general. The
labels 1-4 on the four branches correspond to solu-
tions with extremal norm. Their shapes are shown
below

The magenta branches are bifurcating from the
trivial branch and connect at labels 2, 3, 5 to fur-
ther branches. AUTO detects bifurcation points
at labels 2 and 3. Label 5 is not detected by AUTO
as a bifurcation point although the inspection of
the solutions at the crossing suggests a true bifur-
cation. Labels 1 and 4 are selected as points with
extremal norm.

The branch bifurcating at ζ = 2.79923 is not
depicted in the bifurcation diagram. The blue
branch detaches from the trivial branch at ζ =
3.58827 and comes back to it at ζ = 2.72872.
The red branch bifurcates from the trivial one at
ζ = 4.02617. Apparently it does not come back
to it but instead joins the blue branch at label 2.
At label 1 a 1-soliton was found and at label 3 a
2-soliton.

6. Conclusions and open problems

Let us ﬁnally summarize our results from the point of view of their applicability. A ﬁrst
outcome of our analysis is that the search for frequency combs can from now on be reduced
to speciﬁc parameter regimes. Theorem 1 shows for large |f| and small |d| that, roughly
speaking, frequency combs satisfy the estimate (cid:107)a(cid:107)∞ = O(|f|3|d|−1) uniformly with respect
to ζ. In particular this result gives us an upper bound for the maximal amplitude that one can
expect for a highly localized soliton. In the case of normal dispersion d < 0 Theorem 2 shows
that no non-trivial combs exists outside the explicit interval [ζ∗, ζ∗] of detuning parameters.
Here ζ∗ < 0 < ζ∗, and ζ∗,−ζ∗ = O(f 6|d|−2) for large f and small |d|. A similar result holds
for abnomalous dispersion d > 0.

Theorem 3 and 4 prove the existence of bifurcating branches of frequency combs and
provide explicit formulae for the parameter values at which these branches emanate from
the trivial ones. This is the analytical justiﬁcation for what AUTO is successfully doing,
i.e., ﬁnding bifurcation points and following bifurcation branches. The resulting bifurcation
diagrams are quite complicated (cf. Section 5) and so far no simple pattern or structure

has become apparent. Additionally, it remains open to investigate both analytically and
numerically points of secondary bifurcation where the non-trivial branches split up.

The use of AUTO opens new possibilities to numerically compute the shape of speciﬁc
frequency combs, and it allows to make observations and conjectures. Let us list two of
them.

• We observed that in the bifurcation diagrams with respect to f the two solitons of
Figure 8 appeared at turning points of the bifurcation curves, cf. Figures 6 and 7. It
will be worth while to investigate further if this observation is true in more general
cases. Concerning the bifurcation diagram with respect of ζ of Figure 13 it is not clear
which property characterizes the points where solitons are found (cf. Figure 14).
• Soliton combs are particularly important, and one would like to drive the pump-
resonator system into such a state. Since the solitons from Figures 8 and 14 were
found on bifurcation curves connected to the trivial states one might use this fact in
applications or laboratory set-ups in the following way: try to calibrate the parameters
in order to follow the bifurcating branches until the targeted solution is reached.

We are aware that the last remark immediately leads to the important question about sta-
bility of solutions along branches. To the best of our knowledge AUTO does not oﬀer a
straightforward option that provides stability information for non-parabolic equations like
(1.7). Locally near the bifurcation points the principle of exchange of stability (cf. [5, 13])
allows to analytically predict the stability or instability of solutions. Although this is an
interesting piece of information, we refrained from elaborating it because of two reasons: it
would have substantially enlarged the exposition and its validity is restricted only to small
neighborhoods of the bifurcation points. Instead, it would be much more interesting to char-
acterize the stability or instabilty globally along the branches. Analytically, this is very
challenging and currently out of reach.
It will be one of our future goals to attack this
question numerically.
