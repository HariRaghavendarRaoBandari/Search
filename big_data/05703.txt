We report the ﬁrst use of a ring cavity to both enhance the output power and dramatically narrow
the linewidth (< 1 MHz) of blue light generated by four wave mixing in a rubidium vapour cell. We
ﬁnd that the high output power available in our cavity-free system leads to power broadening of the
generated blue light linewidth. Our ring cavity removes this limitation, allowing high output power
and narrow linewidth to be achieved concurrently. As the cavity blue light is widely tunable over the
85Rb 5S1/2 F=3 → 6P3/2 transition, this narrow linewidth light would be suitable for second-stage
laser cooling, which could be valuable for eﬃcient 85Rb BEC production.

Atomic vapours are a versatile tool for studying a
wide range of nonlinear phenomena. In particular, quasi-
resonant atomic systems allow processes such as electro-
magnetically induced transparency, fast and slow light,
lasing without inversion and four wave mixing (FWM) to
be studied at low light intensities [1]. The resonant en-
hancement of FWM in a rubidium vapour is such that it
can be used for eﬃcient frequency up-conversion of near-
infrared light (780 nm and 776 nm) to blue light (420 nm)
[2–5]. For optimal pump detuning, vapour pressure and
pump polarisation, modest power diode laser pumps can
be used to generate 1 mW of coherent blue light, corre-
sponding to a conversion eﬃciency of 260 %/W [5]. Such
eﬃcient FWM has applications ranging from quantum
information [6, 7] to second-stage laser cooling and sen-
sitive atomic imaging [8, 9].

Recent work on FWM in rubidium systems has show
that transverse phase structure, for example orbital an-
gular momentum (OAM), can be transferred between the
pump and generated beams [10, 11]. The ability to eﬃ-
ciently transfer OAM between diﬀerent wavelengths may
be important for future applications of structured light
[12], for example higher dimensional quantum informa-
tion processing. Eﬃcient FWM is not restricted to this
particular system and various wavelengths can be gener-
ated by making use of diﬀerent atomic states [13–15] or
diﬀerent alkali metals [16]. High conversion eﬃciencies
have also been demonstrated in rubidium-ﬁlled hollow-
core photonic crystal ﬁbers [17].

In this letter we investigate the eﬀect of adding a ring
cavity, singly resonant with the generated blue light, to
our rubidium vapour FWM system [2, 4, 5]. We ﬁnd that
a low ﬁnesse cavity more than doubles the output power
and greatly reduces the linewidth of the blue light pro-
duced. In previous single pass FWM experiments, for low
output powers (around 10 µW), the linewidth of the co-
herent blue light has been reported to be ≤ 3 MHz [2, 18].
However, in our single pass setup, up to 340 µW of co-
herent emission can be generated. For these high output
powers the linewidth of the blue light increases to around

33 MHz. We attribute this increase in linewidth to power
broadening of the 420 nm transition, as discussed later in
this work. Our ring cavity bypasses the eﬀect of power
broadening on the system, allowing blue light to be gen-
erated with high output power (940 µW) as well as a
narrow linewidth (≤ 1 MHz). FWM in a ring cavity us-
ing a purely near-infrared FWM scheme within rubidium
has also recently been investigated [19].

Our experimental set-up and the relevant level scheme
for 420 nm light generation in a rubidium vapour is shown
in ﬁgure 1. The 780 nm and 776 nm pump beams undergo
a single pass through a heated rubidium cell, exciting the
two photon resonance between the 5S1/2 ground state
and the 5D5/2 excited state. This develops a popula-
tion inversion on the 5D5/2 → 6P3/2 transition which
produces a 5.2 µm ﬁeld via ampliﬁed spontaneous emis-
sion (ASE) [2]. This initial ASE together with the pump
lasers establishes three photon coherence on the 5S1/2 →
6P3/2 transition, which in turn allows for the coherent
emission of 420 nm light via FWM. The ring cavity is
designed to be singly resonant with this generated blue
light, thus enhancing the eﬀective length of the ”laser
medium”, allowing increased FWM conversion eﬃciency.
The 780 nm and 776 nm pump beams are provided
by two extended-cavity diode lasers (ECDLs). To en-
sure they are copropagating the pump beams are over-

lapped on a grating and then coupled into a polarisa-
tion maintaining single mode optical ﬁbre. The combined
780 nm and 776 nm ﬁbre output is then horizontally po-
larised before entering the cavity through a dichroic mir-
ror. Two achromatic lenses form a 2f
imaging system
(f = 200 mm) that focusses the near-IR pump beam to
a e−2 radius of 52 µm in the centre of the heated rubid-
ium cell. The cell is 25 mm long and contains 87Rb and
85Rb in their natural abundancies. The cell temperature
was measured using absorption spectroscopy of a weak
(1 µW) collimated 780 nm probe beam [20].

FWM within the rubidium vapour produces horizon-
tally polarised 420 nm light, copropagating with the
pump beams. Light at 5.2 µm is also generated [15] but it
is not observed in our setup as it is absorbed by the glass
cell. In order for the cavity to be singly-resonant with
the blue light we use a prism to separate the 420 nm light
from the near-IR pump beam. The pump beam is then
blocked and the blue light is fed back to the heated cell. A
half waveplate and a polarising beam splitter (PBS) are
used to couple light out of the cavity. The waveplate al-
lows the amount of output coupling to be controlled. We
have studied the eﬀect of the cavity on FWM for 65 %
and 5 % output coupling, which correspond to a cavity
ﬁnesse of 3.5 and 12.8 respectively. The parasitic loss in
our cavity is around 25 %, the majority or this is due to
loss at the PBS and the four 4 % reﬂections at the cell.
Firstly, we will discuss the eﬀect of the cavity on blue
output power. We do this by comparing the output power

2

as a function of 776 nm detuning for single pass FWM
and with-cavity FWM, shown by the red and blue curves
in ﬁgure 2. The output power was monitored using a
photodiode at the cavity output and the single pass re-
sults were recorded simply by blocking the cavity after
the PBS. When recording spectra the 780 nm laser was
set to the detuning for maximum single pass blue power,
as detailed in ﬁgure 2. The 776 nm detuning was deter-
mined by 780 nm and 776 nm two photon spectroscopy in
the heated Rb cell and is given relative to the 85Rb 5P3/2
F=4 → 5D5/2 F=5 transition. The 780 nm detuning (rel-
ative to the 85Rb 5S1/2 F=3 → 5P3/2 F=4 transition)
was determined by saturated absorption spectroscopy in
a room temperature Rb cell.
For single pass FWM, as the 776 nm laser is scanned
across the 85Rb 5P3/2 → 5D5/2 transition, there are two
detunings for which blue light is produced, near ∆776 =
−1.8 GHz and ∆776 = 1.2 GHz. These correspond to two-
photon resonance with the 5S1/2, F = 3 → 5D5/2 and
5S1/2, F = 2 → 5D5/2 transitions respectively.
In the
cavity-enhanced results this same behaviour is observed
but with the addition of large increases in blue output
power when the 420 nm light, whose frequency scans with
the 776 nm frequency, is resonant with the cavity.

Due to energy convservation, the frequency of the
FWM ﬁelds must satisfy the condition ω780 + ω776 =
ω5200 + ω420, where ω780, ω776, ω5200 and ω420 are the
frequency of the 780 nm, 776 nm, 5200 nm and 420 nm

FIG. 2. Blue power output power as a function of 776 nm detuning for a single pass (PSP , red lines) and with the cavity (PC ,
blue lines). The right hand scale shows the blue intracavity power, PIC . Plots a) - f) correspond to the following conditions: a),
b) 130 ◦C, 1.6 mW 780 nm, 2.7 mW 776 nm; c), d) 130 ◦C, 13 mW 780 nm, 23 mW 776 nm; e), f) 90 ◦C, 13 mW 780 nm, 23 mW
776 nm. Cell temperatures of 130 ◦C and 90 ◦C correspond to vapour pressures of 0.12 Pa and 0.009 Pa respectively. The output
coupling at the PBS was 65 % for a), c) and e) and 5 % in b), d) and f). Absolute frequency scales are accurate to ±0.1 GHz.
The 780 nm detuning is a), b) 1.7 GHz; c), d) 1.8 GHz; e), f) 1.6 GHz. Representative values of the gain, G = PC /PSP , are
shown, with the detuning each value was calculated at marked by a vertical dashed line.

ﬁelds respectively. As a result, if the frequency of either
of the pump lasers is changed then ω420 or ω5200 (or both)
must change accordingly. For the case of near resonant
stepwise excitation of the 5S1/2 → 5D5/2 transition it
has been shown that the 420 nm frequency exactly mir-
rors changes in pump frequency [21], suggesting that the
5.2 µm ﬁeld remains resonant with the atomic transition.
However, if the pump lasers are far oﬀ resonance (1 THz)
with the 5P3/2 state then it has been reported that ω5200
can vary as well as ω420 [22]. In our experiment we have
measured (using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer)
the change in ω420 due to a change in ω776 to be given
by ∆ω420 = 0.92(1)∆ω776. This indicates that the de-
tuning of our pump lasers from the 5P3/2 intermediate
state (< 2 GHz) is suﬃcient to allow ω5200 to change as
well as ω420. The mean separation of the observed cavity
resonances in ﬁgure 2 is 198(2) MHz. This corresponds to
a change in 420 nm frequency of 182(2) MHz, which is in
strong agreement with the expected free spectral range
based on the length of our cavity, 181.9(3) MHz.

The result shown in ﬁgure 2 c) was obtained for the
conditions we determined optimal for single pass FWM: a
cell temperature of 130 ◦C and maximum available pump
powers (13 mW 780 nm, 23 mW 776 nm).
In this case
340 µW of single pass blue light is generated directly after
the cell. The cavity output coupling was set to 65 %.
This value was chosen as it produced maximum cavity-
enhanced output power. Under these conditions a peak
of 940 µW of output power was produced at the cavity
output; 2.8 times the power after the cell for a single
pass.

To fully understand the with-cavity trace in ﬁgure 2
c) a theoretical model of the system is required. Such
a model is beyond the scope of this letter, but in order
to ascertain which processes would be of particular im-
portance to such a model we have recorded spectra for a
wide range of conditions: reduced cell temperature (ﬁg-
ure 2 e) and f)), reduced pump power (ﬁgure 2 a) and
b)) and decreased output coupling (right hand column of
ﬁgure 2).

Firstly, we note that for high conversion eﬃciency, as
in ﬁgure 2 c) and d), it is clear that saturation eﬀects
become important, as can be seen by the ﬂattening oﬀ of
the resonances. This is particularly obvious for positive
detuning in 2 d). Another feature of the high conver-
sion eﬃciency traces is that the cavity enhances the blue
output power even when it appears to be oﬀ resonant.
The eﬀect is particularly pronounced for increased feed-
back (ﬁgure 2 d)). However, if the intracavity power
is reduced, either by reducing the pump power or reduc-
ing the cell temperature, then the cavity-enhanced traces
take on the more familiar form of increased power on res-
onance and decreased power oﬀ resonance.

By comparing the width of the resonances in each of
the traces in ﬁgure 2 the predominant broadening mech-
anisms can be determined. Both reduced cell temper-
ature and reduced pump power result in a narrowing
of resonances. This suggests that power broadening of

3

the 420 nm transition dominates over collision broaden-
ing. Comparing the left and right column in ﬁgure 2
it is also clear the the resonance width of the “passive”
cavity (determined by the ﬁnesse) also plays a role. For
65 % output coupling (left column) the passive cavity res-
onance width is 51 MHz, whilst for 5 % output coupling
(right column) it is reduced to 14 MHz.
In ﬁgure 2 e)
and f) this decrease is enough to outweigh the increase in
power broadening due to the increased intracavity power,
and so the resonances in f) are narrower. In ﬁgure 2 c)
and d) however the opposite is true, the change in power
broadening is largest and consequently the resonances are
broader for reduced output coupling.

We have also demonstrated that the cavity signiﬁ-
cantly decreases the linewidth of the generated blue light.
We obtained the linewidth by beating the FWM blue
beam against a 420 nm ECDL (Newport Vantage tunable
diode laser) and measured the resulting beat note using a
spectrum analyser. The frequency of the 420 nm ECDL

FIG. 3. Beat note signal (BNS) obtained from the FWM blue
light overlapped with a 420 nm ECDL. Plot a) shows the re-
sult for a cell temperature of 130 ◦C, and b) 90 ◦C. The insets
show the single pass BNS (red) and the cavity-enhanced BNS
(blue) taken with the same scan range. The main plots show
a second trace of the relative detuning (δ420) of the cavity-
enhanced beat note taken over a smaller scan range. For 90 ◦C
the smaller scan covers only the larger of the two with-cavity
peaks in the inset. The dashed lines are Lorentzian ﬁts, the
FWHMs of which are given in the ﬁgure. For all results the
spectrum analyser had a sweep time of 4 ms. In the insets,
the 420 nm detuning is given relative to the 85Rb 5S1/2 F=3
→ 6P3/2 F=4 transition, with the absolute detuning accurate
to ±25 MHz. The 780 nm and 776 nm detunings were within
±0.1 GHz of their optimal detunings for single pass FWM.

was monitored using saturated absorption spectroscopy,
allowing the absolute frequency of the blue FWM light to
be determined as well as the linewidth. Figure 3 shows
the result of the beat note measurement for single pass
and cavity-enhanced blue light generation, taken at both
90 ◦C and 130 ◦C. The 780 nm and 776 nm pump powers
were 13 mW and 23 mW respectively. In the following we
will ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss the beat note obtained for blue
light generated via single pass FWM, and then go on to
discuss the cavity-enhanced case.
The single pass beat note, both at 90 ◦C and 130 ◦C, is
composed of more than one subpeak. Similar substruc-
ture has been observed previously in [2] where it was
explained by the 6P3/2 hyperﬁne splitting of 10, 20 and
40 MHz between the F’= 1, 2, 3, 4 levels. However, in our
measurement the width of the subpeaks make it diﬃcult
to determine if the substructure we observe is from the
same source. Fitting to one of the subpeaks of the ob-
served beat note signal gives the beat note linewidth to
be 11 MHz (33 MHz) at 90 ◦C (130 ◦C). We attribute this
diﬀerence in FWHM to power broadening of the 420 nm
transition, as collision broadening of the 420 nm transi-
tion is negligible. Based on the single pass blue power
and the e−2 radius of the blue light in the rubidium
cell (46µm), we calculate the power broadened width of
the 420 nm transition to be 4 MHz (41 MHz) at 90 ◦C
(130 ◦C) [23].

For a single pass, we ﬁnd that maximal blue light is
generated slightly red detuned from the 420 nm transi-
tion, as shown in the insets in ﬁgure 3. These detunings
are within a Doppler width of the 420 nm resonance and
so are in agreement with previous work [21].
In addi-
tion, we ﬁnd that the blue light can be tuned easily to
frequencies either side of the transition, with a FWHM
tuning range of 920(25) MHz and 770(25) MHz at 130 ◦C
and 90 ◦C respectively.
The main plots in ﬁgure 3 show the beat note for the
cavity-enhanced blue light. At both 130 ◦C and 90 ◦C the
linewidth is dramatically narrowed to ≤ 1 MHz FWHM.
For the 130 ◦C cell the beat note produced is a single
sharp peak of FWHM 0.7 MHz. At 90 ◦C the with-cavity
light has a similar linewidth but there is an additional
secondary peak in the beat note signal. Measurements
of the beam proﬁle at the cavity output show that this

4

may be due to higher order transverse modes.

The beat note linewidth will have some contribution
from the linewidth of the 420 nm ECDL used for the
beat note measurement. To estimate this contribution
the linewidth of the ECDL was measured separately by
recording the frequency noise at the side of a Doppler
broadened transmission feature. The autocorrelation
of the laser frequency noise at 0.1 ms was found to be
0.5 MHz. The 0.1 ms time scale is relevant as it corre-
sponds to the time taken for the spectrum analyser to
scan over the FWHM of the with-cavity beat note signals.
This suggests that a large proportion of the beat note
FWHM may come from the ECDL linewidth, and there-
fore the linewidth of the cavity-enhanced FWM light will
be much less than 0.7 MHz on a 0.1 ms time scale.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the ﬁrst use of a
ring cavity to both enhance the power output and dra-
matically narrow the linewidth of blue light generated
via FWM in a rubidium vapour cell. For a cell tem-
perature of 130 ◦C the resulting output power is nearly
1 mW (more than twice the output power of the cavity-
free case) and the linewidth drops from a power broad-
ened linewidth of 33 MHz to less than 1 MHz. Further-
more, the blue light is generated with a frequency close
to the 85Rb 5S1/2 → 6P3/2 transition and is tuneable
over a FWHM range of almost 1 GHz. The increased
output power, narrow linewidth and large tuning range
could make this FWM in a ring cavity system a valuable
light source for eﬃcient 85Rb BEC production [24]. In
addition, if the input laser powers were increased or the
large parasitic losses present in our cavity minimised, for
example by using an anti-reﬂection coated or Brewster
cell, then even larger output powers would be possible.
