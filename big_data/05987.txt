SO(d, 1)-invariant Yang-Baxter operators

and the dS/CFT correspondence

∗

Abstract

We propose a model for the dS/CFT correspondence. The model is constructed in
terms of a “Yang-Baxter operator” R for unitary representations of the deSitter group
SO(d, 1). This R-operator is shown to satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation, unitarity, as
well as certain analyticity relations, including in particular a crossing symmetry. With
the aid of this operator we construct: a) A chiral (light-ray) conformal quantum ﬁeld
theory whose internal degrees of freedom transform under the given unitary repre-
sentation of SO(d, 1). By analogy with the O(N) non-linear sigma model, this chiral
CFT can be viewed as propagating in a deSitter spacetime. b) A (non-unitary) Eu-
clidean conformal quantum ﬁeld theory on Rd−1, where SO(d, 1) now acts by con-
formal transformations in (Euclidean) spacetime. These two theories can be viewed
as dual to each other if we interpret Rd−1 as conformal inﬁnity of deSitter spacetime.
Our constructions use semi-local generator ﬁelds deﬁned in terms of R and abstract
methods from operator algebras.

1 Introduction
Non-linear sigma models in 1+1 dimensions play an important role in several areas of
theoretical and mathematical physics, see e.g. [Ket00] for a review. They become ac-
(maximally symmetric), such as SN−1 = O(N)/O(N − 1). This model by construction has
cessible to analytical methods in particular when the target manifold is a coset manifold
a manifest internal O(N)-symmetry as well as further hidden symmetries that make it
integrable. Its target space is the Riemannian manifold SN−1, and its internal symmetry
group is compact. String theory is closely related to non-linear sigma models, where the
target space comes into play as the spacetime in which the strings propagate. Often, it is

assumed to be of the form R3+1×Kn, where Kn is a suitable compact Riemannian manifold

representing the n extra dimensions1. However, there is no a priori reason not to consider

1Note that, in order for a sigma-model to describe strings, a symmetry inherited by reparameterization
invariance of the string must be preserved at the quantum level. This forces n to have certain well-known
special values, depending whether or not one includes fermions. We will not consider such symmetries in
this paper, so in this sense the connection to string theory is not a direct one.

more general target spaces where not just the extra dimensions are curved. For instance, it
seems natural to consider target spaces such as deSitter spacetime dSd = SO(d, 1)/SO(d),
which, like the sphere, is a coset manifold (maximally symmetric space). This type of
non-linear sigma model would be expected to have an internal SO(d, 1)-symmetry (which
is not compact) together, perhaps, with further hidden symmetries by analogy with the
O(N) non-linear sigma model.

To exploit the hidden symmetries, say, in the O(N)-model, one may take advantage of
the fact that its scattering matrix must be factorizing. In combination with the internal
O(N) symmetry, natural assumptions about the “particle spectrum” (basically the repre-
sentation of O(N)), hints from perturbation theory, and the highly constraining relations
imposed by crossing symmetry, Yang-Baxter relation, analyticity, etc., one can often guess
the form of the 2-body scattering matrix, which then consistently determines the n-body
scattering matrix [Zam78, AAR01]. In order to derive from such a scattering matrix quan-
tities associated with the local operators of the theory, one can for example follow the
bootstrap-form factor program [Smi92, BFK06]. The aim of this program is to determine
the matrix elements of local operators between in- and out-states (form factors), which are
found using the scattering matrix and various a priori assumptions about the form factors.
The program is largely successful but runs into technical difﬁculties when attempting to
compute higher correlation functions in terms of the form factors, or, indeed, when trying
to even show that the corresponding series converge.

An alternative approach is to construct the operator algebras generated by the local
quantum ﬁelds by abstract methods (see [SW00, Lec03], and [Lec15] for a review). The
input is again the scattering matrix, but the procedure is rather different. First, one con-
structs certain half-local generator ﬁelds. These “left local ﬁelds” φ(x) play an auxiliary
role and are constructed in such a way that with each of them, there is an associated “right
local ﬁeld” φ(cid:48)(x
(cid:48)) such that [φ(x), φ(cid:48)(x
are space like related points in
1+1 dimensional Minkowski space and x
is to the right of x in a relativistic sense. We
will actually work with a similar construction for a “chiral half” of a massless theory on a
lightray, where [φ(u), φ(cid:48)(u

(cid:48) ∈ R lightray coordinates [BLM11].2

(cid:48))] = 0 if x and x
(cid:48)

(cid:48)

(cid:48))] = 0 if u

(cid:48) > u with u, u

Both on two-dimensional Minkowski space and in the chiral lightray setting, the left
and right local ﬁelds generate left and right local operator algebras, and suitable intersec-
tions of these algebras then contain the truly local ﬁelds [BL04]. The latter are thereby
characterized rather indirectly, and indeed, the local ﬁelds do not have a simple expression
in terms of the auxiliary semi-local objects, but rather reproduce the full complexity of the
form factor expansion [BC12].

In this article, we will show that such constructions also work for non-compact target
spaces such as dSd. Since the internal symmetry group, SO(d, 1), is non-compact, its non-
trivial unitary representations must necessarily be inﬁnite-dimensional. This is an obvious
major difference, say, to the O(N)-model, where the basic representation under which
the single particle states transform is the fundamental representation, which is ﬁnite (N-
) dimensional. Despite this difference, one may proceed and ask whether the algebraic

2There exists no meaningful scattering theory on a single lightray, and the underlying 2-body operator
can here no longer be interpreted as a scattering operator. It rather serves as an algebraic datum (“R-matrix”,
or “Yang-Baxter operator”) which deﬁnes the theory.

method can be generalized to non-compact groups such as SO(d, 1). For this, one ﬁrst
needs a 2-body scattering matrix (or rather, an “SO(d, 1)-invariant Yang-Baxter operator”,
see Sect. 2.1) satisfying suitable properties such as Yang-Baxter-relation, crossing symme-
try, analyticity, unitarity, etc. In turns out that the precise algebraic and analytic properties
required to make the method work are related to each other in a rather intricate way, and
one does not, a priori, see an obvious way to generate simple solutions to the require-
ments. One result of our paper is to provide3 such a Yang-Baxter operator for the spin-0
principal, complementary and discrete series representations of SO(d, 1) in Sect. 2.4. This
is facilitated by using an invariant geometrical description of the corresponding represen-
tations due to Bros, Epstein, and Moschella [BM96, EM14] (Sect. 2.2). Our Yang-Baxter
operator R can hence be used to deﬁne left- and right half-local operator algebras for
this model, as we show in a general framework in Sect. 3.1, and as concrete models in
Sect. 4.1. If it could be shown that suitable intersections of such algebras are sufﬁciently
large, then this would indeed correspond to (a chiral half of) a local 1 + 1 dimensional
ﬁeld theory describing, in some sense, the quantized left (or right-) movers of a non-linear
sigma model with non-compact target space.

The group SO(d, 1) is not just the isometry group of d-dimensional deSitter spacetime
dSd, but also the conformal isometry group of (d − 1)-dimensional Euclidean ﬂat space
Rd−1. This dual role becomes geometrically manifest if one attaches a pair of conformal
boundaries I ±
to dSd. Each of these boundaries is isometric to a round sphere Sd−1,
which in turn may be viewed as a 1-point conformal compactiﬁcation of Rd−1 via the
stereographic projection. The induced action of SO(d, 1) by this chain of identiﬁcations
provides the action of the conformal group on Rd−1. This well-known correspondence is at
the core of the so-called “dS/CFT-correspondence/conjecture” [Str01, GHSS09]4. The idea
behind this correspondence is that with the pair of inﬁnities I ±
there is associated a pair
of Euclidean conformal ﬁeld theories5 acted upon by SO(d, 1). On the other hand, with
the “bulk” dSd, there is associated a corresponding “string-theory” with internal symmetry
group SO(d, 1). The action of the group essentially connects these two theories.
Inspired by this circle of ideas, one might be tempted to ask whether one can, in
our setup, also naturally construct a Euclidean conformal ﬁeld theory on Rd−1 associated
with our sigma models with target space dSd. We will demonstrate in the course of this
article that this is indeed the case. In our approach, the core datum is a 2-body scattering
matrix / Yang-Baxter operator R. In Section 4.2 we will outline an abstract procedure how
to obtain a corresponding Euclidean conformal ﬁeld theory from such an object. Thus,
within our framework, there is a sense in which the essentially algebraic quantity R can
3 Some cases of our Yang-Baxter operator were previously derived in [DKM01, DM06, DM11, CDI13]
using the powerful method of “RLL-relations”. Apart from using a different formalism, the crucial difference
to our work lies in the fact that we also investigate the analyticity properties, and in particular the crossing
symmetry relation, which requires non-trivial adjustments. We also note that [DKM01, DM06, DM11,
CDI13] typically consider complex Lie-algebras rather than their real forms, so questions of unitarity –
resulting e.g. in the different types of series – are not emphasized. Both crossing symmetry and unitarity
play an essential role in our work.

4 It is a cousin of the much better studied “AdS/CFT-correspondence” [Mal98, Wit98].
5 Such theories would not be expected to be reﬂection positive, i.e. have a unitary counterpart in
Minkowski space Rd−2,1. One way to see this is that unitary representations of SO(d, 1) do not correspond
to unitary representations of SO(d − 1, 2) via “analytic continuation” [FOS83].

theory” in d-dimensional deSitter target space, and thereby gives a model for the dS/CFT
correspondence.

That correspondence manifests itself more concretely as follows in our construction. If

2 Invariant Yang-Baxter operators and functions

The main input into all our constructions is a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE)
with additional symmetries.
In this section, we consider solutions to the YBE that are
compatible with a representation V of a group G and an associated conjugation Γ. In our
subsequent construction of ﬁeld-theoretic models, we will be interested in the case where
↑(d, 1), V is an irreducible (spin-0, principal, complementary or discrete series)
G = SO
representation of it, and Γ the corresponding TCP operator.
In order to compare with O(N) sigma models and related constructions, we introduce
in Section 2.1 Yang-Baxter operators and functions in the general context of a unitary
representation of an arbitrary group G, and discuss some examples. The relevant aspects
↑(d, 1) are recalled in Section 2.2 in a manner suitable
of the representation theory of SO
for our purposes, and the connection to the Klein-Gordon equation on de Sitter space
is recalled in Section 2.3. These representations are then used in Section 2.4, where
examples of invariant Yang-Baxter operators for the Lorentz group are presented.

2.1 Deﬁnitions and examples
In the following, a conjugation on a Hilbert space means an antiunitary involution, and the
letter F is reserved for the ﬂip F : (cid:75) ⊗(cid:75) → (cid:75) ⊗(cid:75) , F(k1 ⊗ k2) = k2 ⊗ k1, on the tensor
square of a Hilbert space (cid:75) . When it is necessary to emphasize the space, we will write
F(cid:75) instead of F. For identities on various spaces, we write 1 and only use more speciﬁc
notation like 1(cid:75) or 1(cid:75) ⊗(cid:75) where necessary.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G be a group, V a unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space (cid:75) ,
and Γ a conjugation on (cid:75) .

Our main interest is in invariant Yang-Baxter operators, the Yang-Baxter functions serve

Independent of G, V, Γ,(cid:75) , the four operators
±1,±F are always elements of (cid:82)op(V, Γ); these are the trivial unitaries satisfying the
constraints (R1)—(R5). The structure of (cid:82)op(V, Γ) and (cid:82)fct(V, Γ) depends heavily on the
It is clear from the deﬁnition that any (say, continuous) function R ∈ (cid:82)fct(V, Γ) de-
ﬁnes an invariant Yang-Baxter operator R(0) ∈ (cid:82)op(V, Γ), and any operator R ∈ (cid:82)op(V, Γ)
deﬁnes a (constant) Yang-Baxter function R(θ) := R. Furthermore, any invariant Yang-
Baxter function deﬁnes an invariant Yang-Baxter operator on an enlarged space. This is
spelled out in the following construction, which we will use later on in the context of our
QFT models.

Lemma 2.2. Let R ∈ (cid:82)fct(V, Γ) (for some group G, on some Hilbert space (cid:75) ), and consider
the enlarged Hilbert space (cid:75) := L2(R, dθ)⊗(cid:75) ∼= L2(R → (cid:75) , dθ), with G-representation
1⊗ V and conjugation ((C ⊗ Γ)ψ)(θ) := Γψ(θ). On (cid:75) ⊗(cid:75) ∼= L2(R2 → (cid:75) ⊗(cid:75) , dθ1dθ2),

deﬁne the operator

Then R ∈ (cid:82)op(1⊗ V, C ⊗ Γ).

(RΨ)(θ1, θ2) := R(θ1 − θ2)Ψ(θ2, θ1) .

(2.1)

The proof of this lemma amounts to inserting the deﬁnitions and is therefore skipped.

See [LS14, BT15] for similar results.
For later use, we mention that we can also work with a different measure dν(θ) than
point measures, located at θ1, ..., θN ∈ R. In that case, L2(R2, dν(θ1)dν(θ2)) ∼= CN ⊗ CN,
Lebesgue measure dθ in this construction. For example, we can take a ﬁnite number N of
with orthonormal basis {e jl}N
j,l=1, invariant under the conjugation C⊗C. On vectors Ψ jl :=
Ψ⊗ e jl ∈ (cid:75) ⊗2 ⊗ CN ⊗ CN, our invariant Yang-Baxter operators then take the form

(RΨ) jl := R(θ j − θl)Ψl j .

(2.2)

This construction can also be seen as an example of the partial spectral disintegration

formulas considered in [BT15].

Before presenting examples, we recall how an invariant Yang-Baxter operator R gives
rise to an R-symmetric Fock space, following [LM95, Lec03, LS14].
In this Fock space
construction, we consider an invariant Yang-Baxter operator R and call its group repre-
sentation, conjugation, and Hilbert space V1, Γ1, and (cid:72)1, as these data enter on the one
of the braid group of n strands on (cid:72) ⊗n

As is well known, solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation (R4) induce representations
, by representing the elementary braid βk, k =

particle level.

will be convenient representation spaces for our models. We next give some examples of
invariant Yang-Baxter operators and functions.
Example 1: O(N). We consider the group G = O(N) in its deﬁning representation V
on CN, with complex conjugation in the standard basis as conjugation. This is a typical
ﬁnite-dimensional example, which appears in particular in the context of the O(N) sigma
models. It is known from classical invariant theory that the O(N)-invariance constraint
(R2) allows only three linearly independent solutions: The identity 1 of CN ⊗ CN, the ﬂip
F, and a one-dimensional symmetric projection Q [GW09, Thm. 10.1.6]. One can then
check that (R1)—(R5) together only allow for trivial solutions, i.e. (cid:82)op(V, C) = {±1, ±F}.
However, non-trivial Yang-Baxter functions R ∈ (cid:82)fct(V, C) do exist. A prominent exam-

ple is

R(θ) = σ1(θ)· Q + σ2(θ)· 1 + σ3(θ)· F ,

which satisﬁes not only (R1’)—(R5’), but also the analytic properties (R6’), (R7’) that
will be introduced in Section 3.1. This Yang-Baxter function describes the O(N)-invariant
two-body S-matrix of the O(N)-sigma model [Zam78].
Example 2: The “ax + b” group × inner symmetries. As an example of a different
nature, we consider “ax + b” group, i.e. the afﬁne group (cid:80)o generated by translations
u (cid:55)→ u + x and dilations u (cid:55)→ e
−λu on the real line R. The physical interpretation is to
view R as a lightray, which describes one chiral component of a massless ﬁeld theory on
two-dimensional Minkowski space8.
The group (cid:80)o has a unique unitary irreducible representation Uo in which the genera-
tor of the translations is positive. We may choose L2(R, dθ) as our representation space,
and then have, (x, λ) ∈ (cid:80)o,

(Uo(x, λ)ψ)(θ) = ei x eθ · ψ(θ − λ) ,

where the variable θ can be thought of as being related to the (positive) light like momen-
tum p by p = eθ . The conjugation (Cψ)(θ) := ψ(θ) extends this representation to also
include the reﬂection x (cid:55)→ −x on the lightray.
In this example, the invariant Yang-Baxter operators R ∈ (cid:82)op(Uo, C) can all be com-
puted, and in contrast to the O(N) case, many such operators exist. The physically inter-
esting ones are given by multiplication operators of the form

as in (2.1), where σ ∈ L

(RΨ)(θ1, θ2) = σ(θ1 − θ2)· Ψ(θ2, θ1)
∞(R → C) is a scalar function satisfying

σ(θ) = σ(θ)−1 = σ(−θ) .

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

Such “scattering functions” include for example the two-body S-matrix of the Sinh-Gordon
model, which is [AFZ79]

σ(θ) = sinh θ − i b

,

sinh θ + i b
where 0 < b < π is a function of the coupling constant.

To generalize to a setting with inner symmetries, we can also, instead of (cid:80)o alone, take
the direct product (cid:80)o× G of (cid:80)o with an arbitrary group G, which is thought of as a global
space (cid:75) , and form the direct product representation Uo ⊗ V on (cid:72)1 = L2(R, dθ)⊗(cid:75) ∼=
L2(R → (cid:75) , dθ), i.e.

gauge group. We then consider a unitary representation V of G on an additional Hilbert

((Uo(x, λ)⊗ V (g))ψ)(θ) = ei x eθ · V (g)ψ(θ − λ) .

(2.10)

For later application, we stress that (cid:75) can still be inﬁnite-dimensional, as it is the case for
the irreducible representations of G = SO

↑(d, 1).

8With minor modiﬁcations, this construction can also be carried out for a massive representation of the

Poincaré group in two space-time dimensions.

8

Under mild regularity assumptions, one can then show that essentially all invariant

To also have a TCP operator in this extended setting, we assume that there exists a con-

jugation Γ on (cid:75) that commutes with V (i.e., V must be a self-conjugate representation),
and then consider C ⊗ Γ as TCP operator for Uo ⊗ V .
Yang-Baxter operators R ∈ (cid:82)op(Uo⊗ V, C ⊗ Γ) are again of the form (RΨ)(θ1, θ2) = R(θ1−
θ2)Ψ(θ2, θ1) (2.1). That is, R acts by multiplying with an (operator-valued) function R,
and this function R has to exactly satisfy the requirements (R1’)—(R5’). In particular, R(θ)
commutes with V (g)⊗ V (g) for all θ ∈ R, g ∈ G.

This example is therefore quite different from the previous O(N)-example: Many in-
variant Yang-Baxter operators exist, and they are essentially all given by invariant Yang-
Baxter functions via (2.1). Both examples can be combined by taking the inner symmetry
group as G = O(N), as one would do for describing the O(N)-models [LS14, Ala14].

The construction just outlined here can be used to describe the one-particle space of
a (chiral component of) a massless sigma model with symmetry group G. To prepare our
↑(d, 1), we review some representation theory of

(2.14)

In order for this to deﬁne a unitary representation, we must equip (cid:75)ν with an invariant
(under Vν(Λ)) positive deﬁnite inner product. It turns out that this is possible only for
certain values of ν. These are10:
a) (Principal series) ν ∈ R.
b) (Complementary series) iν ∈ (0, α).
c) (Discrete series) iν ∈ α + N0.
Two complementary or discrete series representations Vν, Vν(cid:48) are inequivalent for ν (cid:54)= ν(cid:48)
and two principal series representations Vν and Vν(cid:48) are equivalent if and only if ν = ±ν(cid:48)

We now explain what the inner products are in each case. As a preparation, consider ﬁrst

Using this lemma, we can now describe the inner products.

a) Principal series: Here the degree of homogeneity of the wave functions is −α−iν with
ψ2 of two smooth wave functions ψ1, ψ2 ∈ (cid:75)ν
ν real. Consequently, the product f = ψ
is homogeneous of degree −(d − 1), so the lemma applies. We choose an “orbital base”

By Lemma 2.3, this deﬁnition is independent of the par-
ticular choice of B, in the sense that, if B
is homologous
(cid:48)
to B, then the inner product deﬁned with B
instead of B
coincides with (2.17). This fact implies at once that the op-
erators Vν(Λ) are unitary with respect to this inner product. Since the type of argument is
used time and again, we explain the details:

The ﬁrst equality sign is the deﬁnition. In the second equality, it is used that (Λ−1)∗ω =
ω, and in the third equality, a change of variables P → Λ−1 · P was made. In the last step
we used Stokes theorem, noting that the integrand is a closed form, and that B and Λ−1· B

are homologous.

The Hilbert space of the principal series representation is deﬁned as the completion in

the inner product (2.17) of the space (cid:75)ν, which we denote by the same symbol.
Pointwise complex conjugation does not leave (cid:75)ν invariant (unless ν = 0) because the
degree of homogeneity is complex, and conjugation changes ν to −ν. Since ω is real, this
implies that ψ (cid:55)→ ψ is an antiunitary map (cid:75)ν → (cid:75)−ν, intertwining Vν and V−ν.

To compare Vν and V−ν, it is useful to introduce the integral operator

If α− iν, iν /∈ −N0, the poles of the Gamma function are avoided. The integrand has a
singularity at P = P

arising from particular choices of B). Thus Iν is well-deﬁned as it stands in particular for

(2.19) by replacing ν with ν − i and then taking the limit  (cid:38) 0 (as a distributional
boundary value, see for example [VK91, Chap. 3]). This adds a delta function term and
yields a well-deﬁned operator Iν for ν ∈ R\{0}. Finally, for ν = 0, one has to take into
account the Gamma factors in (2.19) when performing the limit ν → 0. In this case, one
obtains I0 = 1 (this follows from the delta function relation (B.2) in Appendix B).
After these remarks concerning the deﬁnition of Iν, note that for ψ ∈ (cid:75)ν, the value of

Appendix A), the identity I−ν = I

b) It is clear that Γν is an antiunitary operator on (cid:75)ν. As complex conjugation C
satisﬁes C Iν C = I−ν = I
b) Complementary series: Here the homogeneity of the wave functions is −α− iν, with
iν ∈ (0, α), so ν is imaginary.
In this case, we cannot apply the same procedure as in
the case of the principal series to form a scalar product, because the product f = ψ1ψ2
of two smooth wave functions ψ1, ψ2 ∈ (cid:75)ν is not homogeneous of degree −(d − 1), and
operator Iν : (cid:75)ν → (cid:75)−ν (2.19), which is well-deﬁned also for iν ∈ (0, α).
As in the case of the principal series, also here the integral operator Iν (2.19) has the
intertwining property V−ν(Λ)Iν = Iν Vν(Λ) for all Λ ∈ SO
↑(d, 1). As ν is imaginary, the
intertwining operator Iν ensures that the function f = ψ1 Iν ψ2 on C +
wave functions ψ1, ψ2 ∈ (cid:75)ν is homogeneous of degree −(d − 1), and Lemma 2.3 shows

conjugation is a well-deﬁned operation on (cid:75)ν. Moreover, complex conjugation commutes

serves positivity, it is non-trivial, however, that this inner product is actually positive deﬁ-

conjugation is a well-deﬁned operation on (cid:75)ν. Moreover, complex conjugation commutes
with Iν for imaginary ν. Thus, if we deﬁne (Γν ψ)(P) := ψ(P), then Γν is an antiunitary
involution on (cid:75)ν in the case of the discrete series.

This ﬁnishes our outline of the representations. In conclusion, we mention that the conju-

a phase factor (as we shall do in later sections). With the help of Γν, one can therefore
extend Vν to include the reﬂection X (cid:55)→ −X .11

11We mention as an aside that by considering also partial reﬂections which only invert the sign of one
of the coordinates of X , we could in fact extend Vν to a (pseudo-unitary) representation of the full Lorentz
group O(d, 1).

2.3 Representations of SO↑(d, 1) and Klein-Gordon ﬁelds on dSd

In this short section we recall the relation between the principal and complementary se-
ries representations Vν and classical and quantum Klein-Gordon ﬁelds on d-dimensional
deSitter spacetime12 dSd. For our purposes, this space is best deﬁned as the hyperboloid

dSd = {X ∈ Rd+1 | X · X = −1}

On testfunctions F ∈ C

(2.29)
embedded in an ambient (d + 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime Rd+1. The metric of
dSd is simply (minus) that induced from the ambient Minkowski space. It is manifest from
this deﬁnition that the group of isometries of dSd is O(d, 1), where group elements act by
X (cid:55)→ ΛX .
(dSd), orthochronous Lorentz transformations act according
to F (cid:55)→ FΛ := F ◦ Λ−1, and we choose an antilinear action of the full spacetime reﬂection
X (cid:55)→ −X by F (cid:55)→ F− : X (cid:55)→ F(−X ). The precise relationship between these transformations
on dSd and the “momentum space” representations Vν from the previous section is, as in
ﬂat space, via a special choice of “plane wave mode functions”. These mode functions
are deﬁned as follows. Let P be any vector in C +
d , choose any time-like vector such as
e = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) in the ambient Rd+1, and deﬁne

preserved by the integral operator. This follows from the relation (B.2).

The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix B.
If we go to one of the canonical models for the orbital base B (described in Ap-
pendix A), we get concrete formulas for ω and the kernel Rθ .
In the case of the ﬂat
model, our expression for Rθ then coincides, up to a phase, with an expression derived
previously [CDI13] (see also [DKM01]) for the case of the principal series representation.
These authors also proved the Yang-Baxter equation (R4”), and a version of the idempo-
tency relation (R5”). Their formalism for ﬁnding Rθ is based on a different model for the
representations.

As explained before, the exponents wi are ﬁxed by homogeneity requirements in the
variables P1, P2,Q1,Q2 up to one remaining free parameter, which is iθ. Setting this pa-

There do however exist many other invariant Yang-Baxter functions, because there are
two operations we may carry out on the above integral operator without violating the
properties (R1”)—(R5”): Scaling of θ and multiplication by suitable θ-dependent scalar
factors.

a scalar function will be exploited in the next section.

3 Crossing symmetry and localization
As explained in Section 2.1, an invariant Yang-Baxter operator R ∈ (cid:82)op(V1, Γ1) (Def. 2.1)
gives rise to an R-symmetric Fock space on which twisted second quantized versions V, Γ
of the representation V1 and the conjugation Γ1 act. These “covariance properties” are
one essential aspect of the Yang-Baxter operators in our setting. The other essential aspect
are locality properties, which are linked to speciﬁc analyticity requirements on R. These
analyticity properties, to be described below, have their origin in scattering theory, where
they describe the relation between scattering of (charged) particles and their antiparticles
[Iag93].

3.1 Crossing-symmetric R and half-local quantum ﬁelds

For the following general discussion, we ﬁrst consider the conformal sigma models with
some arbitrary inner symmetry group G (“Example 2” of Section 2.1), and later restrict
↑(d, 1). Our exposition is related to [BLM11], where a scalar version of such
to G = SO
models was presented, and [LS14], where a massive version with ﬁnite-dimensional rep-
resentation V1 was analyzed.
We consider on the one hand the representation Uo (2.6) of the translation-dilation
group(cid:80)o of the lightray on L2(R, dθ), and the conjugation (Cψ)(θ) = ψ(θ) on that space.
V with commuting conjugation Γ on a Hilbert space (cid:75) . Our one-particle space is then
(cid:72)1 = L2(R → (cid:75) , dθ), with the representation (2.10) and the conjugation
ξ ∈ L2(R → (cid:75) , dθ) .

On the other hand, we consider an arbitrary group G, given in a unitary representation

Θ := C ⊗ Γ ,

(Θξ)(θ) = Γξ(θ) ,

We pick an invariant Yang-Baxter function R ∈ (cid:82)fct(V1, Γ1) as the essential input into
symmetric Fock space (cid:72) R over (cid:72)1 given by the invariant Yang-Baxter operator R deﬁned

the following construction of quantum ﬁelds. These ﬁelds will be operators on the R-

f(x,λ)(u) := f (eλ(u− x)) .

Analogously, the TCP transformed function f− : u (cid:55)→ f (−u) yields ( f−)± = − f ±, where the

minus sign is due to the fact that we consider the current.

Given any vector k ∈ (cid:75) , we deﬁne the ﬁeld operators (cf. [SW00, Lec03])

φR,k( f ) := z†

We may think of the vector k as a label for the different “components” φR,k of the ﬁeld φR.
Note, however, that (cid:75) can be inﬁnite-dimensional, so that φR can be a ﬁeld with inﬁnitely
By proceeding to delta distributions δu, sharply localized at a point u on the lightray,

many independent components.

we may also describe this ﬁeld in terms of the distributions φR,k(u) := φR,k(δu).
In the present general setting, one can show that the ﬁeld operators transform co-
variantly under Uo and V , but not under the TCP operator Θ. Furthermore, φR,k( f )∗ =
φR,Γk( f ) on an appropriate domain. We do not repeat the calculations from [LS14] here
(see, however, Section 4 for a concrete version of these properties), but rather focus on
the locality aspects.
13The prefactor ±ieθ in (3.5) is motivated by the fact that we want to study a chiral ﬁeld, which has
an infrared singularity at zero momentum because of the divergence in the measure (p2 + m2)−1/2d p for
m = 0. This problem is most easily resolved by passing to the current of this ﬁeld, which amounts to taking
derivatives of test functions. As these derivatives result in the prefactor ±ieθ , subsequent formulas will be

easier if we include this factor from the beginning.

20

To begin with, one realizes that φR is a non-local ﬁeld unless R = F, in which case it
satisﬁes canonical commutation relation and reduces to a free ﬁeld. For general R, the
locality properties of φR are best analyzed by introducing a second “TCP conjugate” ﬁeld,

(3.12)

In case that (cid:75) ∼= CN is ﬁnite-dimensional, these requirements coincide with the cor-
responding ones in [LS14, Def. 2.1], where the conjugation was taken as (Γζ)k := ζ
k,
ζ ∈ CN, with the components ζk referring to a ﬁxed basis and k (cid:55)→ k an involutive permu-
tation of {1, . . . , N}.
The signiﬁcance of (R6’)—(R7’) is best explained in terms of Tomita-Takesaki modu-
lar theory (see, for example, [KR86]), as we shall do now. Note, however, that in the
explicit examples to be considered in Section 4, we will also give a purely ﬁeld-theoretic
formulation (Theorem 4.2).

For the following argument, we adopt the concept of “modular localization” [BGL02].
The main idea is to anticipate a quantum ﬁeld theory, deﬁned in terms of a system of
local von Neumann algebras [Haa96], and the connection between the modular data of
the algebra corresponding to the half line R+ and the one-parameter group of dilations

term in (3.16), and insert an identity 1 = (∆it ⊗ ∆it)(∆−it ⊗ ∆−it), t ∈ R, in front of R. In

view of the invariance (R2) of R, we then see that this scalar product equals

The vectors in the left and right hand entry of the scalar product are analytic in the strip
< Im(t) < 0 (taking into account the antilinearity of the left factor, and the fact that
f + ∈ dom ∆−1/2 in the right factor). As explained above, the same analyticity holds for
the operator-valued function t (cid:55)→ (1⊗ ∆it)R(∆−it ⊗ 1). Taking into account the boundary
values ∆−1/2 f + = f

be regarded as the “physical” quantum ﬁelds of the model, but rather as auxiliary objects
[BBS01]. To proceed to the physical observables/ﬁelds, localized in ﬁnite intervals on the
lightray, it is helpful to use an operator-algebraic setting.

R,k(cid:48)(u

By construction, the ﬁeld operators satisfy (on a suitable domain) φR,k(u)∗ = φR,k(u) if
Γk = k. One can show by the same method as in [LS14] that φR,k( f ) is then essentially
selfadjoint. In this case, we can form the unitaries eiφR,k( f ) by the functional calculus, and
pass to the generated von Neumann algebra

(cid:77)R := {eiφR,k( f ) : f ⊗ Γk = f ⊗ k , supp f ⊂ R−}(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊂ (cid:66)((cid:72) R) .

The same holds true if ν1 = ν2 = ν belong to a complementary or discrete series repre-
sentation, and we set ε = iν in (3.21). Thus for all principal and complementary series
representations, ˜Rνν is crossing-symmetric in the sense of Def. 3.1.

In Appendix B, we also provide an alternative integral representation of the factor
(θ). In case we allow for arbitrary combinations of principal, complementary and
σν1,ν2
discrete series representations ν1, ν2, the (rescaled) Gamma factors in (2.40) can produce
poles in the strip 0 < Im(θ) < π, which is the reason for our restriction to two principal
series representations, or a single complementary resp. discrete series representation.

The function σν1ν2 (3.21) is precisely constructed in such a way that the crossing re-
lation (R7”) holds14. There remains however a large freedom to modify σν1ν2 without
violating the conditions (R1”)–(R7”). In fact, we may multiply ˜Rν1ν2
by another function

θ

14 This function may be viewed as a solution to a cocycle problem. A related, but not identical, problem

of this general nature is treated in [Sch95].

There exist inﬁnitely many of such “scattering functions”, they are given by all inner func-

ρ(−θ)−1. Using the canonical factorization of inner functions (see, for example, [Dur70]),
one can then write down explicit formulas for ρ. In particular, if ρ contains no singular
part, it has the form

where κ ≥ 0, and the zeros bl have to satisfy 0 < Imbk < π and certain symmetry and
summability conditions to ensure ρ(iπ− θ) = ρ(θ) = ρ(−θ)−1 and convergence of the
product [Lec06].

The ﬁeld φR is seen to fail the usual condition of Einstein causality in both, its lightray

and its de Sitter coordinate, due to the presence of the R-factors in (4.5).

So in this sense φR does not, by itself, straightforwardly deﬁne a local quantum ﬁeld
neither on the lightray nor on de Sitter space. However, the ﬁeld satisﬁes a kind of remnant
of the locality condition in the lightray variable. As explained in the abstract setting in
Section 3.1, this is best understood in interplay with its TCP reﬂected partner ﬁeld.

this context: a) Under which conditions are the algebras (cid:65)R(I) “large” (for example in
the sense that the Fock vacuum Ω is cyclic)? And b): Under which conditions does the

Following the same arguments as in the scalar case [BLM11] (which build on [GLW98]),

in particular because the nuclearity criteria [BL04] that can be applied to the O(N) models

The simplest case of this construction is given when instead of the integral operators R,

for any open, bounded region O ⊂ Rd−1. By construction, conformal transformations act
geometrically on the net O (cid:55)→ (cid:69)R(O) in the sense that Vν(Λ)(cid:69)R(O)Vν(Λ)−1 = (cid:69)R(Λ · O).
If we choose our discretized rapidities {θ j} to be spaced equidistantly and formally take

we take the ﬂip R = F on(cid:75)ν⊗(cid:75)ν. In that case, the Rθ factor drops out of the commutation

correlation functions are not reﬂection positive [NO14] (and so do not deﬁne a CFT in
(d − 1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime satisfying the usual axioms) apart from the
limiting case ∆ = α corresponding to the standard free ﬁeld. Locality of the ﬁeld theory is
(x i, ki) ↔ (x j, k j). At the level of the von Neumann algebras, this amounts to saying that,
expressed by the fact that the above correlation functions are symmetric under exchanges

if O and O

are disjoint, the corresponding von Neumann algebras commute

(cid:48)

[(cid:69)F(O),(cid:69)F(O

(cid:48))] = {0} .

In this sense, the Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory deﬁned by the assignment O (cid:55)→ (cid:69)F(O) is

“local”.

This structure is modiﬁed if instead of the ﬂip, we use our integral operators R. In that
case, the ﬁelds φR, j are not “local” in the sense that the correlation functions are no longer
symmetric, and consequently (4.34) does not hold. To obtain a local Euclidean theory, one
could consider the algebras

5 Conclusion

In this work we have constructed Yang-Baxter R-operators for certain unitary representa-
↑(d, 1). The properties of these operators, in particular the Yang-Baxter equa-
tions of SO
tion, unitarity, and crossing symmetry make possible two, essentially canonical, construc-
under the given unitary representation and b) A Euclidean CFT in (d − 1) dimensions in
tions: a) A 1-dimensional “light ray” CFT, whose internal degrees of freedom transform
↑(d, 1) acts by conformal transformations. Both a) and b) are con-
which the group SO
structed from one and the same R-operator (in a complementary series representation).
Theory b) depends on a discretization parameter N corresponding to a set of N discretized

33

“rapidities”, {θ j}. The operator algebras in cases a) and b) become formally related when
N → ∞.

In fact, the operator algebra a) is related to certain left- and right local ﬁelds on the
lightray, (4.11) and (4.15) whereas the operator algebra in case b) to certain ﬁelds of
the form (4.27). They are built from certain generalized creation/annihilation operators
z†(θ, P) in case a) and z†
(x ) in case b). These operators satisfy a Zamolodchikov-Faddeev
j
algebra into which the R-operators enter. P is a deSitter “momentum” which corresponds
to x as in Fig. 1 resp. eq. (4.25). The index j corresponds to the j-th discretized rapidity,
θ j. The rapidity variable θ can be thought of–roughly speaking–as “dual” to the lightray
variable, u (in the sense of Fourier transform), whereas x is dual to X (deSitter points) (in
the sense of Fourier-Helgason transform (2.33)). Thus, when the spacing between {θ j}
goes to zero, the operator algebras formally coincide, and we think of this isomorphism as
a manifestation of a dS/CFT-type duality.

In line with this interpretation, one is tempted to think of N as a “number of colors”
by analogy with the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, we note that the algebra in case
b) does not have a corresponding symmetry such as O(N) acting on the index j. What is
restored in the limit as N → ∞ is merely a symmetry corresponding to ZN at ﬁnite N.

We ﬁnally note that our construction does not yield an ordinary local quantum ﬁeld
theory on deSitter spacetime.
Indeed, despite the formal similarities between the ex-
pressions for a free deSitter quantum ﬁeld of mass m (see eq. (2.37)) and our ﬁeld (see
eq. (4.11)), we note that these are actually quite different. Whereas the former is local
in the spacetime sense with respect to the causal relationships in deSitter spacetime, the
latter is not (it is only “half-local” in the lightray variable u, which is absent in eq. (2.37)).
It would be interesting to see whether a variant of our method can also produce new local
quantum ﬁeld theories in the ordinary sense in deSitter spacetime. We must leave this to
a future investigation.

continuation in the parameters zi in the formula and an application of the residue

After these preparations, we turn to the proofs of Theorem 2.9 and Theorem 3.4.

Proof of Theorem 2.9.
Some parts of the following proof are similar to the one in [CDI13] – in particular, the
veriﬁcation of the Yang-Baxter equation (R4”) via a star-triangle (triality) relation.

We ﬁrst restrict attention to the case when all νi correspond to principal or comple-

mentary series representations.
(R2”) This invariance property holds by the deﬁnition of Rθ in terms of Lorentz invariant
inner products, and by making use of exactly the same line of argument as in eq. (2.18).
(R3”, part I) The ﬂip operator simply exchanges the variables, so that on the level of
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
integral kernels, we have (F ν2ν1 Rν1ν2
). By inspec-

(θ) (2.40), one then sees that the ﬁrst
tion of the kernel and the constant cν1ν2
equation in (R3”) holds.
(R1”), (R3”, part II), (R5”): For unitarity (R1”) and the TCP symmetry (R3”, part II), we
have to distinguish the principal and complementary series, because the scalar products
and conjugations are different for the two series.

In case ν1, ν2 ∈ R both belong to principal series representations, the scalar product is

Here the second step follows by direct inspection of the kernel, taking into account ν1, ν2 ∈

In case both ν1 and ν2 belong to the complementary series, the scalar product is more
complicated, but the conjugations Γν1, Γν2 are simply complex conjugations (Lemma 2.6),
so that the TCP symmetry (R3”, part II) amounts to Rν1ν2
This equation holds true because iν1, iν2 are real for the complementary series.

Here the dotted lines result from two propagators with opposite powers that cancel

each other. The ﬁrst dotted line produces a factor of Γ(iν2)Γ(−iν2), and the second dot-
ted line produces a factor of Γ(iν1)Γ(−iν1). Taking into account these factors (and the
Γ-factor from the initial diagram), one then realizes that the last step represents the in-
tegral kernel of Rν1ν2−θ . This ﬁnishes the proof of (R3”, part II) for two principal series
representations. For the mixed case (one principal series representation and one comple-
mentary series representation), the proof is similar.

Returning to (R1”) for two complementary series representations, one ﬁnds that be-
cause of the appearance of the integral operators Iν in the scalar product, the adjoint is
given by

Passing to the graphical notation, this kernel is given by the exact same diagram as in

the TCP symmetry proof for the principal series, but with the replacements ν1 → −ν1,

38

To ﬁnish the proof of (R1”) and (R5”), it now remains to show Rν1ν2

ν2 → −ν2, P1 → Q1, P2 → Q2. Converting the last diagram in the earlier calculation into
an integral kernel then yields Rν2ν1−θ (P1, P2;Q1,Q2). Thus, as in the case of two principal
)∗ = Rν2ν1−θ . Again, the proof for the mixed case is
series representations, we have (Rν1ν2
similar.
θ Rν2ν1−θ = 1. This
follows (for all combinations of principal/complementary series representations) by appli-
cation of the composition relation (B.4).
(R4”) The integral identity underlying the Yang-Baxter relation is the triality relation.

One ﬁrst calculates that the left and right hand sides of (2.41) coincide on arbitrary ψ ∈
(cid:75)ν1
⊗ (cid:75)ν3 if and only if the following two integral kernels (with the graphical

⊗ (cid:75)ν2

notation introduced for the triality relation) coincide:

As a shorthand notation, we wrote here again ν±
Note that these integral kernels differ from the ones arising from the Yang-Baxter equa-
tion by factors of (2π) and Gamma functions of the parameters, but the overall factors are
the same for both diagrams.

kl := i

(νk ± νl).

We now use the triality relation to convert these diagrams into a more symmetrical
form. Beginning with the left diagram, we ﬁrst convert the interior triangle to a star,
and then the three resulting stars into triangles. This shows that the left diagram above
coincides with

.

Analogous operations yield equality of the right diagram above with

The two resulting hexagon diagrams are congruent and hence give identical integral ker-
nels.

.

Setting all ν-parameters to one and the same value, the properties (R1”)–(R5”) imply
the properties (R1’)–(R5’) of an invariant Yang-Baxter function for the representation Vν
and conjugation Γν. (The properties here are slightly stronger because of the division of
(R3’) into two separate equalities in (R3”).)

Finally, the normalization (2.42) follows by setting ν1 = ν2 in the kernel (2.39), and

taking the limit θ → 0 with the delta function relation (B.2).

The case when one or more ν-parameters correspond to a discrete series representa-
tion can be reduced to the previous cases by perturbing the corresponding ν-parameters
slightly from their discrete values along the real axis. Then the same arguments as given
for the complementary series go through, and the desired identities are obtained in the
limit where the relevant ν-parameters go to their discrete values. One has to take care,
however, to apply all identities to suitable wave functions, and, for the complementary
series variables, use the constraint (2.23) before taking the limit. One also has to check
that this constraint is actually preserved by the R-operator. This follows from (B.3).

Proof of Theorem 3.4.
We will use the shorthand notation ν±
assume that both representations belong to the principal series, ν1, ν2 ∈ R.
The integral kernel (2.39) is entire analytic in θ for non-coinciding momenta, and for
−α < Im θ < 0 and principal series representations, all singularities are integrable. Thus
the matrix elements of Rθ are analytic functions on the strip Sα = {θ : −α < Im θ < 0},
and moreover bounded in θ on this domain.

We now explain the reason for the particular form of the factor σν1ν2 (3.21). Inserting

(−iα− θ)·〈ξ2 ⊗ ψ1, Rν1ν2−iα−θ (ψ(cid:48)

In order not to spoil the analyticity of the matrix elements of Rν1ν2, we have to choose
σν1ν2 analytic on the strip Sα. Furthermore, σν1ν2 must satisfy the requirements of Propo-
(−θ) for
sition 2.10, i.e. it must be symmetric in ν1, ν2, and σν1ν2
θ ∈ R.

To verify this claim, we need to examine the functions gν1ν2 and ˆgν1ν2. One ﬁrst checks
the poles of the Gamma functions and sees that gν1ν2 is analytic in the strip Sα if c > 0 is
sufﬁciently large, for instance if we take c = α. Its logarithmic derivative can trivially be

) as z → ∞ in | arg(z)| < π, and going through

|t| → ∞. Thus ˆgν1ν2 (B.10) is well-deﬁned.

Furthermore, we have the symmetry properties Gν1ν2
(t), t ∈ Sα, which imply that ˆgν1ν2 (B.10) is even and real (for real arguments p).
Gν1ν2
Since ˆgν1ν2 also decays fast because it is the Fourier transform of a smooth function, we
see that fν1ν2 (B.9) is well-deﬁned, odd, and real (for real θ). It then follows that σν1ν2
(B.9) satisﬁes the requirements of Prop. 2.10.

It remains to check that σν1ν2 is bounded and analytic in Sα, and that (B.8) holds. Re-
garding analyticity, the integrand of fν1ν2 is entire in θ, and we may estimate the growth

Using the deﬁnitions of σν1ν2 and gν1ν2, the desired equality (B.8) then follows.

We must also check the analyticity and boundedness of the Γ factors in the deﬁnition
of Rν1ν2 and σν1ν2. These follow from the well-known facts that Γ is non-vanishing, has
poles at the non-positive integers, and the standard asymptotic formula (| y| → ∞)

|Γ(x + i y)| ∼ (2π)

It follows that the Γ factors are bounded by O(|θ|(d−1)) for large |θ|. The θ-dependence of
coming from the exponentials is analytic θ once we form the matrix elements of Rθ , and
these exponentials are also clearly bounded in θ. If we take matrix elements with smooth
wave functions, we get from these factors decay as |θ|−n where n is as large as we wish.
|θ|−n for |θ| → ∞ if we take matrix elements with smooth wave functions.

Thus, all pieces in Rθ are analytic in the strip Sα and decay faster than any inverse power

To derive the inﬁnite product formula for σν1ν2

(θ) quoted in (3.21) is rather lengthy,
and we only sketch the main steps. First, we expand the Digamma functions in the deﬁni-
tion of Gν1ν2 using the well-known series

Substituting this series for each of the terms in the expression (B.12) for Gν1ν2, we ﬁnd
that all contributions from Euler’s constant γE and from the sums over 1/(n + 1) cancel
each other. We next calculate ˆgν1ν2
(p) by performing the integral (B.10) over t separately
for each term in the series (this is admissible, because both the series and the integral are
absolutely convergent). The resulting integrals all have the form

−p)−1 using a
geometric series, resulting altogether in a double series indexed by natural numbers n, m.
The integral can be pulled inside this double series and can then be performed fairly easily
for each term. Each such term turns out to be a logarithm, so the double series of these
logarithms becomes a logarithm of a doubly inﬁnite product. The end result can be written
as

(−iθ + α(2n + 1) + m− pν q
(iθ + α(2n + 1) + m− pν q

and this results in the formula (3.21) for σν1ν2 quoted in the main text after choosing for
c the value c = α.
In case we consider two coinciding complementary series representations νi = ν, we
have to take into account the different conjugation and different scalar product (2.21).
One then ﬁnds that the same analytic properties, and in particular the same functional
equation (B.8) are required for the factor σνν. The solution is given by the same inﬁnite
product formula quoted in the main text (3.21), but we now need to choose c = α + iν.
This guarantees in particular absolute convergence of the inﬁnite product, as one may see
(cid:3)
using standard asymptotic expansions of the Gamma function.
