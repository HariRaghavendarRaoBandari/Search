ABSTRACT
The recently published analytic probability density function for the mildly non-linear
cosmic density ﬁeld within spherical cells is used to build a simple but accurate maxi-
mum likelihood estimate for the redshift evolution of the variance of the density, which,
as expected, is shown to have smaller relative error than the sample variance. This
estimator provides a competitive probe for the equation of state of dark energy, reach-
ing a few percent accuracy on wp and wa for a Euclid-like survey. The corresponding
likelihood function can take into account the conﬁguration of the cells via their rela-
tive separations. A code to compute one-cell density probability density functions for
arbitrary initial power spectrum, top-hat smoothing and various spherical collapse dy-
namics is made available online so as to provide straightforward means of testing the
eﬀect of alternative dark energy models and initial power-spectra on the low-redshift
matter distribution.

1 INTRODUCTION

Soon after the observation of accelerated expansion of the
Universe in supernova data in Riess et al. (1998), along with
measurements of the CMB anisotropy,
large-scale struc-
ture (LSS) provided independent evidence for dark energy
and allowed for improved constraints (see Perlmutter et al.
1999). Since then several well-established and complemen-
tary methods are pursued to accurately measure expansion
history and structure growth (see Weinberg et al. 2013,
for
a review). With the advent of large galaxy surveys covering
a signiﬁcant fraction of the sky (e.g. SDSS and in the com-
ing years Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011), DES (Abbott et al.
2005), eBOSS (Dawson et al. 2016), and LSST (LSST Sci-
ence Collaboration et al. 2009)), astronomers are attempt-
ing to understand the origin of dark energy. One venue is
to build tools that can extract accurate information from
these data sets as a function of redshift during the epoch
where dark energy dominates. Constraints can be obtained
from direct observations of distance measures or the growth
of structure which is not only sensitive to dark energy but
also modiﬁed gravity. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs)
provide a standard ruler imprinted in the galaxy correlation

function such that measuring the preferred clustering scales
in redshift and angular separations allows to determine the
angular diameter distance to and Hubble parameter at the
redshifts of the survey, respectively. Measuring the growth
of structure demands probing the non-linear regime of struc-
ture formation, for example by means of galaxy correlation
functions. Recently, topological and geometrical estimators
restricted to some special locations of the cosmic web have
attracted attention as a potential dark energy probe acces-
sible from galaxy surveys, for example the geometry of the
ﬁlaments (Gay et al. 2012) or Minkowski functionals (e.g
Codis et al. 2013, for a recent implementation in redshift
space) to name a few. Here, we will present the probability
distribution function (PDF) of the density in spherical cells
as a complementary probe to constrain dark energy. The
idea to probe subsets of the matter ﬁeld, such as over- and
under-densities, is an interesting direction that can also be
investigated in a count-in-cell formalism.

In this letter, we illustrate how recent progress in the
context of large deviations (e.g. Bernardeau & Reimberg
2015) allow for the construction of estimators for the equa-
tion of state of dark energy relying on an explicit analytic
expression for the PDF of the density in spherical cells as

with τ (ρ) the linear density contrast within the Lagrangian
radius Rρ1/3. According to the spherical collapse model
τ (ρ) = ζ−1(ρ) can be expressed as a non-linear transform
of the density ρ within radius R via an accurate ﬁt for ζ(τ )

is chosen to match the exact high redshift skewness as
described in Bernardeau et al. (2014). The density PDF
given by equation (1) depends on redshift only through
σ = σ(R, z), the amplitude of the ﬂuctuation at scale R and
redshift z. In this work, σ(R, z) will be assumed to scale like
the growth rate function, D(z), although this strictly speak-
ing holds only in the linear regime. In particular, note that
in equation (2), σ(Rρ1/3)/σ is a function of the density ρ,
and cell size R but does not depend on redshift

tion (1) w.r.t. the initial power spectrum.

The above prescription yields simple analytic expres-
sion for the PDF. For instance, for a scale-invariant power
spectrum of index n (< 2.6), and spherical collapse factor
ν, the (un-normalised) PDF has this simple form

Note that, as suggested by Uhlemann et al. (2015), the den-
sity PDF given by equation (1) must be normalised by di-
viding the PDF by its integral and the density by its mean.
Figure 1 shows the comparison between the predicted
PDF given by equation (1), when only the spectral index and
running of the linear power spectrum at the scale of interest
(R = 10Mpc/h) are considered, and the density PDF mea-
sured in a N-body simulation (see Bernardeau et al. 2014,
for details). Percent accuracy is reached for σ below 0.7.

In practice, equation (1) can be applied to arbitrary
linear power spectra. Note that this prediction for the den-
sity PDF depends on the cosmological model through i) the
linear power spectrum and ii) the dynamics of the spheri-
cal collapse (parametrized by ν here, see equation (3)). Ap-
pendix A presents the code LSSFast to compute such PDFs
together with a bundle of PDFs for diﬀerent variances and
radii.

a function of redshift (Uhlemann et al. 2015). The em-
phasis is on simplicity and proof of concept rather than
realism. More precisely, we give a simple but very accu-
rate form of the density PDF in terms of the amplitude
σ(R, z) of the density ﬂuctuation at radius R. We then re-
late the change of variance σ(R, z) with redshift z to the
linear growth rate D(z) which is parametrized by the dark
energy parameters (wa, wp) that characterize the equation
of state w(z) = wp + wa/(1 + z)(Laureijs et al. 2011). A
maximum likelihood estimator is built from the analytical
density PDF to extract a constraint on (wa, wp). We present
and distribute the corresponding code for wider use and ap-
plication to diﬀerent linear power spectra, using e.g. camb
(Lewis et al. 2000). Furthermore, we give an outlook of how
the framework allows to account for the extent of the survey
and model the corresponding biases.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the
analytical PDF of the density in spherical cells parametrized
in terms of the underlying variance. Section 3 compares the
sample versus the maximum likelihood variance. Section 4
describes a ﬁducial dark energy experiment for an Euclid-
like survey and presents the resulting constraints on the
equation of state parameters. Section 5 wraps up. Impor-
tantly, Appendix A provides links to the relevant codes for
arbitrary power-spectra, while Appendix B compares the
two diﬀerent estimators of the variance of the density ﬁeld
using the asymptotic Fisher information.

2 THE ANALYTIC DENSITY PDF

It has been shown in Uhlemann et al. (2015) that the PDF,
PR(ρ|σ), for the density within a sphere of radius R at red-
shift z (with corresponding variance σ ≡ σ(R, z)) has a sim-
ple analytical expression given by

Because we have an accurate theoretical model for the full
density PDF given by equation (1), it is now possible to build
a maximum likelihood estimator for the density variance. In

each density variance. Right-hand panel: mean (and standard deviation) of the density variance estimated from the arithmetic estimator
(ˆσA) in cyan compared to the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator (ˆσML) in red, estimated by equations (B1) and (B3). 1000
realisations of this experiment are used to compute the mean (solid line) and standard deviation (shaded area). As expected, in the
zero variance limit where the PDF is close to Gaussian, both estimators are equivalent but the maximum likelihood approach clearly
outperforms the sample variance estimate as σ increases (by factor 2.5 at σ = 0.6).

order to compare this approach to the traditional sample
variance, we consider a set of 2, 500 spheres of radius R =
10Mpc/h for 13 diﬀerent redshifts (and therefore 13 diﬀerent
density variance σk = σ(zk, R)), and we draw for each sphere
a random density, {ρi,k}.

Figure 2, left-hand panel, displays the predicted PDFs
as well as the corresponding draws. The right-hand panel
displays the corresponding relative error (mean and stan-
dard deviation) on the estimate of σ either from the maxi-
mum likelihood estimator, or while computing directly the
variance of each redshift sample based on 100 Monte Carlo
realisations of this experiment. Since the theory provides us
with the expected PDF, the maximum likelihood based on
this PDF is optimal and unbiased. While the sample vari-
ance is competitive at small variance when the PDF is nearly
Gaussian, it becomes clearly sub-optimal for larger values
of the density variance, e.g by a factor of three for σ = 0.7.
Appendix B shows analytical results on the comparison be-
tween sample variance and maximum likelihood estimator.

4 FIDUCIAL DARK ENERGY EXPERIMENT

The redshift evolution of the underlying density variance
σ2(R, z) can then be used to pin down the parameters of the
equation of state of dark energy. Indeed, a dark energy probe
may directly attempt to estimate the so-called equation of
state parameters (wa, wp) from the PDF while relying on
the cosmic model for the growth rate (Blake & Glazebrook
2003),

densities and the Hubble constant at redshift z = 0, a ≡

state w(z) = wp + wa/(1 + z). Note that the same approach
was employed by Gay et al. (2012) to obtain a dark energy
constraint based on geometrical critical sets.

Let us now conduct the following ﬁducial experiment. In
order to mimic a Euclid-like survey, let us consider redshifts
between 0.1 and 1 binned so that the comoving distance of
one bin is 40Mpc/h, and draw regularly spheres of radius
R = 10Mpc/h separated by d = 40Mpc/h (hence we ignore
neighbouring spheres and assume that the spatial correla-
tions are negligible). For a 15,000 square degree survey, it
yields 50 bins of redshift (zi) with a number of spheres rang-
ing from about N1 = 800 (at z1 = 0.1) to N50 = 45, 000 (at
z50 = 1) for a total of almost 900,000 supposingly indepen-
dent spheres. In this experiment, we assume that the model
for the density PDF is exact and that the variance (which
is a free parameter) is related to the growth rate by linear
theory. At each redshift, we can reconstruct the variance by
measuring the full PDF

As an illustration, the reconstructed ˆσML is shown in Fig-

that, as expected, the reconstruction is more accurate at
higher redshift where the accessible volume and therefore
the number of spheres is larger.
In order to get constraints on the equation of state

The resulting α = 1, 2, 3 sigma contours are shown

L({ρi,j}|wp, wa) = maxwp,wa L({ρi,j}|wp, wa)− 1/2α. Mod-
ulo our assumptions, this maximum likelihood method al-
lows for constraints on wp at a few percent and 1 + wa at
about a ten percent level making it a competitive tool for
the analysis of future Euclid-like surveys. In practice, it is
expected that various uncertainties will degrade the accu-
racy of the proposed method (uncertainties on the model
itself at low-redshift, galaxy biasing, redshift space distor-
tions, observational biases, etc). Accounting for these eﬀects
requires further works, beyond the scope of this paper.

Our main conclusion should still hold once all those ef-
fects are accounted for, namely that there is a signiﬁcant
gain in using the full knowledge of the PDF – therefore rely-
ing on a maximum likelihood analysis – when contrasted to
the direct measurements of cumulants (variance, skewness,
etc). Large-deviation theory will therefore allow us to get
tighter cosmological constraints. In particular, it has to be
noted that in this work, only the redshift-dependent den-
sity variance varies but in principle we could also allow for
variations of the linear power spectrum and dynamics of the
spherical collapse and therefore modiﬁed gravity scenarios.

5 CONCLUSION

Recently, Uhlemann et al. (2015) presented an analytic ex-
pression for the PDF of the density within concentric spheres
for a given cosmology as a function of redshift in the mildly
non-linear regime. Relying on such a expression, an illustra-
tive very simple ﬁducial dark energy experiment was imple-
mented while ﬁtting, in the maximum likelihood sense, a set
of measured densities covering a range of redshift, and seek-
ing the best dark energy model consistent with such a set.
It was demonstrated through this experiment that the max-

ing radius 10Mpc/h regularly drawn between redshift 0.1 and 1.
Contours at one, two and three sigmas are displayed with shaded
areas from dark to light red. The dark red and cyan dots corre-
spond to the recovered most likely solution and the input value
respectively. The resulting precision on wp and 1 + wa is respec-
tively at about the 5% and 10% level.

imum likelihood estimator based on the analytic PDF for
the density within spherical cells yields a more accurate un-
biased estimate for the redshift evolution of the cosmic vari-
ance than the usual sample variance, as expected for non-
Gaussian statistics. The optimality of the maximum likeli-
hood estimator was qualiﬁed perturbatively in Appendix B.
While it is clear that the above-described experiment
is overly simplistic in many respects, it serves as a mean to
demonstrate the predictive power of equations (1)-(4). They
capture the essence of why these PDFs outperform naive
estimates based on Gaussian statistics, and motivates the
publication of the corresponding simple Mathematica code
which is provided online as described in Appendix A.

In order to provide a more realistic framework for such a
dark energy experiment, one would need to also account for
galactic bias and redshift space distortions1, sampling error
and masking. One would then need to deﬁne the optimal
sampling strategy while varying the sphere’s radii and their
redshift evolution given the geometry of the survey, and the
rate of acceleration of the Universe. This probe should of
course be coupled to other existing probes whose ﬁgure of
merit is not degenarate with respect to ﬁgure 4, so as to
tighten the constraints on the EOS of dark energy. On the

it can be also applied to any function of the dark matter density
including a local bias expansion to model the galaxy density ﬁeld.

theoretical side, an obvious extension of the present work
would be to consider the impact of considering only subsets
of the ﬁelds, e.g. under-dense regions (e.g. Bernardeau et al.
2015, and references therein) while making use of the joint
PDF for the density within multiple concentric spheres. Ap-
plying the Large Deviation theory to 2D cosmic shear maps
should also allow us to model the statistics of projected den-
sity proﬁles, which could be used for weak lensing studies.

Up to now, we assumed for simplicity that the dif-
ferent densities in spheres were uncorrelated. An improve-
ment would be to correct for the correlation between not-so-
distant spheres, as quantiﬁed in Codis et al. (2016) using bias
functions which can also be predicted in the large-deviation
regime. Let us consider a conﬁguration made of N spheri-
cal cells which centres are separated by distances rIJ. The
joint PDF PR(ρ1, . . . , ρN; rIJ) of the density {ρI}I<N in the
large-separation limit, where rIJ (cid:29) R, can be written as

APPENDIX A: LSSFAST PACKAGE

The density PDF for power-law and arbitrary power spectra
are made available in the LSSFast package distributed freely
at http://cita.utoronto.ca/~codis/LSSFast.html. Two
versions of the code are presented. The simpler version,
ρPDFns, assumes a running index, meaning that the vari-
ance is given by

σ2(R) =

2σ2(Rp)

(R/Rp)3+ns+α + (R/Rp)3+ns−α ,

(A1)

where α can be non-zero to take into account the variation
of the spectral index ns. The density PDF is analytically
computed from equation (1) and numerically regularised to
enforce the normalisation, the mean and the variance. This
code is very eﬃcient and runs in about one second on one
processor for one evaluation. Note that the function ρPDFns
takes three arguments, ρ, σ and ns, and has one option, α.
The second version of the code, ρPDF, uses input from
camb (Lewis et al. 2000) and can therefore be applied to
arbitrary power spectra. In this case, the function σ2(R) is
tabulated using equation (4). Once this tabulation is done
(typically one minute on one processor), each evaluation of
the PDF takes about the same time as for the power-law
case (≈ 1 sec).

As an illustration, Figure A1 presents a bundle of den-
sity PDFs computed with LSSFast for diﬀerent variances
and radii and a ΛCDM power spectrum. At low σ or equiv-
alently high redshift (in blue), the PDF is almost Gaussian
and concentrated around the mean but as the variance grows
(i.e at smaller redshift), it becomes increasingly skewed and
broad, while the maximum of this PDF is shifted in under-
dense regions as voids are getting emptier and nodes denser.

Figure A1. Left-hand panel: PDF of the density in cells of radius 10Mpc/h as a function of σ from 0.05 (dark blue) to 1 (dark red)
computed from the LSSFast code. In the low σ limit, the PDF is essentially Gaussian, while it becomes very skewed at larger σ (in
red). Here the linear power spectrum is for a WMAP7 cosmology and the spherical collapse dynamics is parametrized by ν = 21/13.
Right-hand panel: same as left-hand panel but for σ = 0.5 and cells of radius from R=1Mpc/h (blue) to 20 Mpc/h (red).

APPENDIX B: COMPARING ESTIMATORS

Let us compare, from a theoretical point of view, our two
diﬀerent estimators of the variance of the density ﬁeld. The
ﬁrst one is the sample variance deﬁned as usual as

perturbatively computed

the so-called relation of consistence). In addition, there is

As expected, the variance obtained for the sample variance
estimator is larger than the one obtained in the maximum
likelihood approach by a factor −5S2
3 σ6/3 proportional to
the square of the skewness of the density ﬁeld. In particular,
we recover that both approaches are equivalent only in the
Gaussian limit. As soon as non-Gaussianities appear, the
sample variance is not optimal anymore.

Figure B1 compares, in the asymptotic limit (N going
to inﬁnity), the sample variance to the maximum likelihood
variance obtained by a non-perturbative approach where

(cid:10)L(cid:48)(cid:48)(ρ|σ2)(cid:11) is integrated numerically. It shows that the sam-

ple variance is sub-optimal when σ increases while the PDF
becomes non-Gaussian. This result is in good agreement
with the Monte-Carlo estimate shown in Figure 2. The per-
turbative analytical prediction given by equation (B7) is
found to reproduce well the expectation at low σ ((cid:46) 0.5).
Note that, in order to account for the spatial correla-
tions between the cells (measured densities are not inde-
pendent), one can model the joint statistics in the large-
separation limit. In that case, an additional error is made so
that for instance the sample variance is given by

arithmetic estimator (ˆσA) in cyan compared to the variance of
the Maximum likelihood estimator (ˆσML) in red estimated numer-
ically in the asymptotic limit (N goes to inﬁnity) and estimated
perturbatively by equation (B7) in green. As expected, both es-
timators are equivalent at small σ when the PDF is nearly Gaus-
sian but as non-linearities arise, the performance of the arithmetic
variance decreases as it is not optimal anymore.
