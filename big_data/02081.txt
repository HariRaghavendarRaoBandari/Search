Ordered Crumpled States in Twisted Ribbons

Elastic ribbons have emerged as a model system to explore the post-buckling regime of thin
sheet including wrinkling and crumpling. Here, we investigate experimentally and theoretically the
torsional and tensile response of a ribbon submitted to a twist under ﬁxed longitudinal tension
and clamped boundary conditions. Upon twisting, the shape of the ribbon is ﬁrst a helicoid, then
longitudinal wrinkles develop above a twist angle threshold and transform into ﬂat triangular facets
akin to an ordered crumpled state. In the pre-buckling regime, the measured torque and contraction
show a nonlinear dependence with the twist angle which can be fully understood solving the F¨oppl-
van K´arm´an equations. The post-buckling behavior is found to exhibit two regimes depending on the
imposed tension T . In a high T regime, the contraction and torque are found to be in quantitative
agreement with predictions obtained by a Far from Threshold (FT) approach. In a low T crumpled
regime, the experimental data are best described using the concept of asymptotic isometry recently
introduced when both tension and thickness are small.

Introduction

Ribbons, strips, belts are used in a wide range of in-
dustrial applications from sheet production to connectors
in soft electronics [1], structural ﬁbers [2] and graphene
nanoribbons [3]. Ribbon geometry can also be found in
Nature in a wide range of lengthscales from plant leaves,
to beta sheets in proteins. In a recent study, the unique
nature of the mechanics of ribbons was demonstrated us-
ing ribbons that are stretched and twisted [4, 5] yielding
shapes with wrinkles, loops and ridges. In particular, at
relatively small tension, triangular faceted helicoid cor-
responding to an ordered crumpled phase has been ob-
served. Other model systems such as blisters [6], thin
ﬁlms on drop [7] and growing thin ﬁlms [8] also exhibit
a crumpled phase which remains poorly understood.

In this paper, we explore the route towards energy lo-
calization and characterized experimentally the mechan-
ical behavior of a twisted ribbon in its crumpled phase
measuring contraction and torque response. No experi-
mental characterization of the energy stored in a crum-
pled ribbon has been reported so far which would give
further insight of the crumpling transition and comple-
ment geometrical characterizations.

Modeling ribbons is a challenging task due to large
deformations and ﬁnite rotations along with strong non
linearities coupling strain and curvature [9]. A ﬁrst ap-
proach, initiated by Sadowsky [10] and, later extended
by Wunderlich [11], assume inﬁnitely thin, strainless rib-
bons which greatly simpliﬁes the problem as the ribbon
surface is now developable allowing a reduction of di-
mensionality from 2D to 1D. A set of balance equations
governing the shape of inextensible ribbons have been de-
rived [12]. It was later shown that these equations can
be mapped onto a rod theory provided an extra internal
variable is added to enforce inextensibility [13].
Inter-
estingly, triangular faceted ribbon has been found to be
solution of the equations using numerical methods high-
lighting localized regions with high mean curvature [14].

More generally, faceted ribbons are examples of singular
shape which have been studied extensively in the context
of crumpled sheets [15] which are usually modeled as in-
teracting elastic singularities forming a complex network
of folds [16–23].

A second approach is based on a seminal work by
Green [24, 25] who derived a set of equilibrium equa-
tions assuming that the ribbon has a small but ﬁnite
thickness thus experiencing bending and stretching mode
upon twisting. These equations can be obtained from
the F¨oppl-von K´arm´an equations [26] and can be ex-
tended to a covariant version to capture ﬁnite rotations
eﬀect [27, 28]. The observed wrinkling and buckling in-
stabilities can be quantitatively understood using a lin-
ear stability analysis[24, 26, 28]. Above threshold, it was
shown experimentally that the wrinkling pattern contin-
uously evolves into a triangular facets with singularities
characterized by high mean and Gaussian curvatures.

While current models can capture some of the behav-
iors of a twisted ribbon, the crumpled phase is not fully
understood either by the inextensible theory and by near
threshold approach of thin extensible sheets. However,
promising models allowing to incorporate extensibility
eﬀect in a developed post-buckling regime have been re-
cently proposed, namely the Far from Threshold and the
asymptotic isometry approaches [28–30]. The main ﬁnd-
ing of this paper is the identiﬁcation of two regimes in the
crumpled phase of a twisted ribbon depending on the ap-
plied tension. In a high-T regime, a Far from Threshold
approach is found to capture quantitatively the experi-
mental data. In a low-T regime, we propose to model the
ribbon using the concept of asymptotic isometry.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst describe
the experimental set-up used to measure the contraction
and torque response of twisted ribbon under constant
load and describe brieﬂy the phenomenology observed.
We then model the ribbon as a thin extensible sheet to
obtain the analytical expression of the contraction and
torque in the uncrumpled, helicoidal regime. Next, we

analyze the crumpled phase using a Far from Thresh-
old approach and the concept of asymptotic isometry.
Finally, we summarize our ﬁndings and discuss some of
their implications.

even for small twist. In this paper, we aim at explain-
ing the nonlinear mechanical response of the ribbon near
(Regimes I, II, and III) and very far (Regime IV) from
threshold building on previous studies [4, 25, 26, 28].

Experimental setup

Pre-buckling regime

In the present experiment, an initially ﬂat ribbon is
stretched by a constant load F and twisted by an angle θ
using clamped boundary conditions (Fig. 1(a)). The rib-
bon is composed of cellulose acetate which has a linear
elastic response for strains less than 2%. Young’s mod-
ulus is E (cid:39) 2.2 GPa and Poisson ratio ν = 0.35 ± 0.05.
The thickness is t = 256 µm, width W = 35 mm and
length L = 331 mm. A torque sensor is placed at the
lower clamp which can only rotate around the longitudi-
nal axis and a load cell at the upper clamp whose vertical
position can be adjusted through the end-to-end distance
D between the two clamps. Non dimensional control pa-
rameters associated with tension and twist are :

T ≡ F/(EhW ),

η ≡ θW/L,

(1)

Us =

respectively. We introduce the conﬁnement parameter :

α ≡ η2/T

(2)

and

which can be interpreted as the ratio of geometrical over
tensile strains. The torque is normalized by EW 2h.
The contraction χ is measured using the relation D =
L(1− χ). Because of the obvious contribution of the ten-
sion T , we introduce ∆χ = χ+T which is the contraction
using the stretched untwisted conﬁguration as reference
(see notations in Fig. 1(b)). In practice, upon twisting
the ribbon, the prescribed load F is kept constant by
continuously adjusting D. Fig. 1(b) presents schemat-
ics of the ribbon morphology when increasing η contin-
uously from zero starting from a pre-streched conﬁgura-
tion at moderate T (Regime I). At small twist (Regime
II) the shape is a stretched helicoid up to a threshold
ηc above which longitudinal wrinkles are observed in the
central part of the ribbon (Regime III) and expands lat-
erally as the twist is increased. Very far from threshold
(Regime IV), ordered crumpled, triangularly faceted rib-
bon is observed characterized localization of the curva-
ture and plastic deformations near the long edges while
the rest of the ribbon undergoes reversible deformations.
The ribbon morphology has been described and char-
acterized elsewhere in details [4]. Fig. 1(c) and (d)
show the (Γ-η) and (∆χ-η) curves respectively which are
measured across the various morphological regimes men-
tioned above. When twisted up to an angle θ = 500deg
(η ≈ 1, the ribbon shows a remarkable capacity to con-
tract by almost 5%. Unlike the classical response of cir-
cular rod, we observed a strong nonlinear contraction of
the ribbon ∆χ and a nonlinear increase of the torque

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)η

To obtain the contraction and torque as a function
of control parameters near threshold, we start by calcu-
lating the energy of a stretched helicoid ribbon loosely
following [26]. The contraction χ and torque Γ can be
formally expressed as :

χ(η, T ) =

FIG. 1. (a) Sketch of the experimental setup. A ribbon is twisting by a normalized angle η under ﬁxed tension T by means of
a rotating clamp and adjustable end-to-end distance D. (b) Upon twisting, the ribbon goes from an initially stretched planar
conﬁguration (I) to a helicoid (II), a longitudinal buckled helicoid above a threshold ηc (see Eq. 16), and ﬁnally an ordered
crumpled, triangularly faceted ribbon (IV) far from threshold. Below a threshold (red solid line), the nonlinear increase of the
normalized torque Γ (c) and the corresponding normalized contraction ∆χ (d) are in quantitative agreement with predictions
given by Eq. 15 and Eq. 13(solid blue lines) without adjustable parameters. Here T = 2.9 × 10−3. Deviations from predictions
are observed above threshold. At large ηc , Γ is found to increase linearly with η.

We look for solution for Eqs. 6 and 7 assuming that
the ribbon is a helicoid with a small twist angle yielding
the following form for the deﬂection :

w(x, y) = ηxy

(10)
We can readily check that H = 0 and G = −η2 as ex-
pected for a helicoid. Further, we assume that the stress
ﬁeld is invariant along the x direction, thus, only de-
pending on the y coordinate. This assumption greatly
simpliﬁes the calculation of the stress ﬁeld since Eq. 7
now reads ∂4φ/∂y4 = η2 and can be easily integrated to
give:

φ =

(11)

where we anticipated that the integration constant is the
contraction χ. We omit x dependent terms because they
would lead to non zero transverse and shear stresses at
y = ±1/2 which are incompatible with the free boundary
condition at the long edges (Eq. 8). The stress compo-
nents are then given by :

Inserting Eq. 12 into Eq. 9, the expression of the contrac-
tion reads:

χ =

η2 − T, ∆χ = η2/24

(13)

It should be noted that the solutions obtained here,
namely the stress ﬁeld, the mean and Gaussian curva-
ture, are still valid even for a ﬁnite twist angle θ provided
η (cid:28) 1 [28]. In our derivation, we only used Eq. 7 which
is related to the in-plane force balance. One can easily
check that the normal force balance given by Eq. 6 is
trivially satisﬁes as well. Interestingly, the bending term
in the r.h.s. of Eq. 6 which is proportional to B∆H has
no contribution provided the ribbon remains in a helicoid
shape (H = 0).

Using Eq. 12 and Eq. 10, the total energy per unit

The ﬁrst three terms are associated with the contribution
from the stretching energy and the work of the load while
the last term is a bending terms proportional to t2. The
contraction and torque can now be calculated. The con-
traction is already known from Eq. 13 but one can check
that the expression obtained is compatible with Eq. 3.

Eq. 15 extends the formula ﬁrst derived by Green [25]
where the eﬀect of a small but ﬁnite tension is now in-
cluded. Let us now evaluate the contribution of the bend-
ing and stretching energies. Although bending terms
does not contribute to the normal force balance, they
enter in the energy through the Gaussian curvature giv-
ing a term that scales as Ub ∼ t2η2. The scaling for the
stretching energy depends on the combination of T and
η. At negligible twist (η2 (cid:28) T ), Us ∼ T 2 (cid:29) t2η2 ∼ Ub,
therefore the bending energy is negligible. At larger twist
(η2 ∼ T ), Us ∼ η2T ∼ η4. Bending energy can be ne-
glected provided T (cid:29) t2. Except for very low tension,
bending term can be safely neglected given the experi-
mental parameters used. The case η2 (cid:29) T corresponds
to the post-buckling regime where the ribbon’s shape is
qualitatively diﬀerent from a smooth helicoid and will be
addressed in the next section.

In Fig. 1(c) and (d), we show that the measured torque
and contraction are in the very good agreement with our
predictions for small enough η without adjusting param-
eters. At larger η, longitudinal wrinkles develop leading
to folds which are responsible for signiﬁcant deviations
from the predictions near threshold. In the following, we
analyze the post-buckling behavior of the ribbon using a
Far from Threshold approach.

High T crumpled regime

√

We propose to develop an understanding of the rib-
bon’s behavior far from threshold when η (cid:29) ηc using
an approach recently proposed in Ref. [29]. Here ηc (or
equivalently αc) is the twist angle threshold obtained
from a linear stability analysis and is given by [4, 26]:

ηc =

24T + ct

(16)
where c ∼ 10 depends slightly ν. Whereas a linear sta-
bility analysis is valid for conﬁguration suﬃciently close
to threshold allowing to take the pre-buckling state as a
reference conﬁguration, a Far from Threshold approach
is based on another ground because it assumes that the
wrinkles strongly aﬀects the stress ﬁeld. More speciﬁ-
cally, when α (cid:29) αc, the reference state is assumed to
be a combination of tensile regions and wrinkled regions
without compression. In the limit of vanishing thickness,
wrinkles in the central part can adjust their shape to re-
lax compression at no signiﬁcant bending cost. To allow
a quantitative analytical approach, the stress ﬁeld of the
ribbon is that of a stretched pre-buckled ribbon charac-
terized by a parabolic proﬁle except that inside the wrin-
kled zone (|y| < ywr) the stress is zero (see Fig. 2). The
proposed form for the longitudinal stress is therefore [28]

(18)
As shown in Fig. 2, when α (cid:29) αc, ywr tends to 1/2
meaning that the wrinkling structure invades the entire
width of the ribbon while the stretching part is conﬁned
to a ﬂap near the edge of vanishing width. More precisely,
the width of the stretching ﬂap is given by 1/2 − ywr ≈
α . We can readily check that the stress ﬁeld proposed
here satisﬁes the boundary conditions and the equation
of in-plane equilibrium. The contraction is now given by

generalizing the expression given in Eq. 13.
We will now calculate the energy of the ribbon far from
threshold, in the asymptotic limit α (cid:29) αc. When calcu-
lating the total energy of the ribbon, the stretching is
found to scale as α−1, the work of load which scales as α
is therefore dominating. In the Far from Threshold limit,
the total energy of the ribbon reduces to the work of the
load and is given by :

All the scalings obtained are summarized in Table I.

Comparing these predictions with our data, the con-
traction is quantitatively captured by our analysis. We
identify a transition from near to far from threshold for
α ∼ 102 which is observed to be T independent. The
corresponding measured torque reveals however a more
complex trend. For α > 102, the torque deviates from
the near threshold prediction but the trend is observed
to depend on the applied tension unlike the contraction
response. More precisely, the torque is found to globally
decrease with T and exhibits a weak dependence on α
which can be captured by a scaling of the form C ∼ αp
with a small exponent p. The scaling C ∼ α1/6 is shown

FIG. 3. Evolution of C = Γ/(ηT ) and K = χ/T as a function
of α for T = 0.2×10−3, 0.4×10−3, 1.6×10−3, 2.9×10−3. The
blue lines correspond to the pre-buckling predictions. The red

dependence is however neglected, thus, we assume that a
plateau, denoted C F T∞ , is reached at large α. As shown in
Fig. 4, C F T∞ decreases with T and reaches asymptotically
the value 1/4 which is precisely the prediction given in
Eq. 21. We conclude that a Far from Threshold analy-
sis can quantitatively explain the contraction and torque
response of a twisted ribbon in a crumpled phase for suf-
ﬁciently high tension. In this high-T crumpled regime,
stretching energy most likely dominates bending energy,
thus, the Far from Threshold approach which neglects
the bending contribution of the folds in the stress ﬁeld
provides accurate predictions. However, at smaller ten-
sion, the stress ﬁeld may be qualitatively diﬀerent from
the proposed form given Eq. 17 indicating that the large
curvatures along ridges and vertices now contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to the stress. The change of regime is further
substantiated when measuring the aspect ratio λ/W of
the triangular facets formed by to two successive fold. We
do not oberve a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the twist on the
triangle shape. However, when decreasing the tension,
we found a transition at T > 1 × 10−2 where the aspect
ratio sharply increases until reaching a plateau λ/W ≈ 2.
No higher value of λ/W could be obtained by reducing
further the tension.

sheet theories. We identiﬁed two regimes depending
on the tension.
In a high-T crumpled regime, the
macroscopic response is dominated by the external
work of the load which can be quantitatively capture
by a Far from Threshold approach which neglects the
contribution of the folds. In a low-T crumpled regime,
bending contributions originating from the localized
curvatures strongly aﬀect the torsional response but
not the contraction. This behavior at low tension can
be understood introducing the concept of asymptotic
isometry where both stretching and localized bending
are taken into account. More work is needed to connect
global behavior with the local response as the proposed
models for the crumpled states are still partially phe-
nomenological.

best rationalized taking n = 1 leading to :

We can also note that the good agreement of the FT
approach to model the contraction, even at large α, indi-
cates that the extra bending terms added in Eq. 23 does
not depend on the tension leaving the scaling for χ un-
aﬀected. Taking γ ≈ 20, data shown in Fig. 4 are well
adjusted by Eq. 24.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we characterized experimentally and
modeled the torque and contractile response of a twisted
ribbon in a crumpled state. The pre-crumpled state is
quantitatively captured when solving the FvK equations.
At large twist angle, the ribbon exhibits a crumpled
state which cannot be capture from inextensible thin
