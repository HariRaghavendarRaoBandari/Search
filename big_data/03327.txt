Fluid simulations show that when a sinusoidal density modulation is superimposed on a linear
density proﬁle, convective instabilities can become absolutely unstable. This conversion can occur for
two-plasmon-decay and stimulated Raman Scattering instabilities under realistic direct-drive inertial
conﬁnement fusion conditions and can aﬀect hot electron generation and laser energy deposition.
Analysis of the three-wave model shows that a suﬃciently large change of the density gradient in a
linear density proﬁle can turn convective instabilities into absolute ones. An analytical expression
is given for the threshold of the gradient change, which depends on the convective gain only.

Success of inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) requires
a comprehensive understanding of laser-plasma instabili-
ties (LPI). Linear theory is essential to assess the impor-
tance of various LPI in ICF. Absolutely unstable modes
are deemed important since they can grow to large ampli-
tudes before nonlinear eﬀects set in. For convectively un-
stable modes, their amplitudes are capped by the Rosen-
bluth convective gain formula [1] . Linear theory is usu-
ally developed assuming smooth plasma density proﬁles
and the resultant gain formulas are used in LPI-assessing
codes [2]. However, during a ns-long laser pulse, signif-
icant density modulations from various LPI modes can
develop and aﬀect the subsequent laser-plasma interac-
tions. LPI under density modulations can be signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from those under smooth density proﬁles. Pre-
vious study found that density modulations can reduce
the LPI growth rates in homogeneous plasmas but can
change convective instabilities into absolute ones in inho-
mogeneous plasmas [3–5]. Pickard and Johnston found
that when the density proﬁle deviates from the linear pro-
ﬁle a strong enough laser can drive absolute modes but
for short-scale-length targets the required laser intensity
is too high to be a concern [6]. Up until now, the density
modulations-induced absolute modes had not been ob-
served in experiments or simulations under realistic ICF
conditions and no theory existed to predict the growth
rates when this conversion occurs.

In this Letter, using ﬂuid simulations, we show for the
ﬁrst time two instances that under realistic ICF condi-
tions and density modulations this convective-to-absolute
mode conversion is important. One is the two-plasmon
decay instability (TPD) [1, 7, 8] in conventional direct-
drive ICF. These TPD modes have low phase velocities
and are essential to the staged-acceleration mechanism
for hot electron generation [9]. The other is the Stimu-
lated Raman Scattering (SRS) instability [10, 11] in the
ignition stage of shock ignition [12]. These SRS modes
are important to generating hot electrons with moderate
energy that can assist shock generation in shock ignition

[12, 13] and can explain the intermittent LPI activities
in the simulations [14].

Using a two-straight-line density proﬁle, we further
show that this conversion is due to a change of the den-
sity gradient and derive an analytical formula for the
gradient change threshold that depends on the convec-
tive gain only. This formula can also apply to the more
general case where a sinusoidal density modulation is su-
perimposed on a linear density proﬁle.
It shows that
due to the long scale length in current ICF experiments,
the density modulation-induced absolute modes are an
important part of LPI. Growth rates of these absolute
modes can also be calculated from this model.

We now show that a sinusoidal ion density modulation
can turn convective TPD modes into absolute ones un-
der realistic ICF conditions. For a linear density proﬁle,
the theory [8, 15] predicts TPD are absolutely unstable
only in a narrow density region close to the 1/4nc sur-
face and only convectively unstable below this absolute
zone. For direct drive ICF, TPD-generated hot electrons
can cause target preheat [16, 17]. On the other hand, in
the ignition phase of shock ignition (SI) [12], hot elec-
trons with moderate energy (less than ∼ 100 keV) could
be stopped at the compressed shell and help drive the
ignition shock. A recent study[9] found that hot elec-
trons are stage-accelerated ﬁrst by the TPD modes in the
n = 0.23nc (nc is the critical density) region where the
theory predicts only convective TPD modes, and then by
those in the higher density region (n = 0.245nc) where
the theory predicts absolute modes. The modes in the
convective zone have lower phase velocities and can more
eﬃciently accelerate thermal electrons. Signiﬁcant TPD
modes in the convective zone were also observed to be
energetically dominant in previous OMEGA experiments
[18] and PIC simulations [19]. These modes were found
to correlate to ion density ﬂuctuation [9]. However, why
these modes can grow beyond the convective gain has not
been understood.

We use the LTS code [20], which solves the full set of

Here Ψ, φ and np are the linearized electron velocity po-
tential, electric ﬁeld potential and electron density per-
turbation, respectively. And n0 and v→0 are the back-
ground plasma density and electron oscillation velocity
in the laser ﬁeld. LTS has been successfully benchmarked
with the TPD theory [15, 21] in the linear density proﬁle
case [20] but it can also study TPD growth under an arbi-
trary n0. We present two LTS simulations, one with and
the other without an ion density modulation, to illustrate
the transition from convective TPD modes to absolute
modes. The physical parameters in the LTS simulations
are chosen for typical OMEGA experiments. Without
the ion density modulation, the background ion density
proﬁle n0 is a smooth linear function, as shown by the
black solid curve in Fig.1(a). It ranges from 0.217 nc to
0.253 nc with a scale length L = 150µm at the 1/4nc sur-
face. The electron temperature is Te = 3 keV. The laser
pulse is a plane wave coming from the left side in Fig.
1(a) with an intensity I = 6 × 1014W/cm2 and a wave-
length of 0.33 µm. With the ion density modulation, the
background ion density proﬁle is the sum of n0 and an os-
cillation component n1 = ∆n sin(x/Lm), as shown in Fig.
1(a) by the red line. The modulation amplitude ∆n and
characteristic length Lm are chosen from typical values
in the nonlinear steady state of the PIC simulations with
the same parameters[9]. Here we choose ∆n = 6×10−4nc
and Lm = 0.65µm. For both simulations, the box size is
400×819.2c/ω0 (21.2×43.5µm) with a grid of 2000×4096
and a grid size ∆x = 0.2c/ω0 (0.01µm), where c is the
speed of light and ω0 the laser frequency. The time step
is ∆t = 0.1414ω−1
(0.025f s). The boundary condition
is periodic in the transverse direction, and dQ/dx = 0
in the longitudinal direction, where Q stands for Ψ, φ
and np. The initial electron density perturbation seed is
set as a 2D Gaussian function with a full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of 0.12µm in each direction and an
amplitude of 10−6 in the middle of the simulation box at
n0 = 0.235nc. We focus on the TPD mode with a trans-
verse wave number ky = 0.48ω0/c inside a narrow region
with a width of 2µm and centered at 0.235nc (between
the two black dashed lines in Fig. 1(a)). Theory for TPD
in homogeneous plasmas [22] predicts this is the resonant
mode for this density. Due to the density gradient this
mode is convective under the linear n0.

Figure 1(b) shows the time evolution of the plasma
wave amplitude of the ky = 0.48ω0/c mode in this region
with and without the ion density modulation n1. With-
out n1, the plasma wave ﬁrst grows and then saturates
after 0.8 ps, consistent with the theory prediction [7].

By contrast, with n1, the plasma wave continues to grow
exponentially and turned from convective to absolute.

To isolate the essential physics and develop a the-
ory, we further simplify Eqs.(1) into the standard 3-wave

cases from theory and the WKB simulations with the two-line
and sinusoidal proﬁles

which is large enough so that a1 and a2 do not reach the
boundary in the whole simulation.

The WKB and LTS simulation results reasonably agree
[Fig. 1(b)]. Using the LTS and WKB simulations, we
scan a wide range of ∆n and Lm that typically occurs
in the PIC simulations, and plot the measured abso-
lute growth rates in Fig 1(c)(d), which again show that
the WKB model retains the essential physics. The ab-
solute growth rate maxes at ∆n ≈ 2 × 10−3nc and
Lm ≈ 0.65µm, and the maximum growth rate is 0.7γ0.
This is more than three times of the conventional abso-
lute modes growth rates near the 1/4nc region[15]. They
are more eﬀective in generating hot electrons due to their
lower phase velocities. In addition, since they locate in
the lower density region, they can also aﬀect the LPI
close to the 1/4nc surface through pump depletion.

We have developed a theory for the conversion thresh-
old and growth rate with a density gradient change
model. We assume V1 > 0 and V2 < 0, which is the
case for TPD and back scattering SRS, in Eqs.(2). For
a smooth linear density proﬁle n0(x), only convective
modes exist[7, 23] with a convective gain exp(πΛ), where
Λ = γ2

We consider a two-line density proﬁle shown in Figure
2(a), leading to φ(x) = 1
2 κ′(1− s)x2, where s = 0 for x <
0 and s > 0 for x > 0. The density gradient changes from
κ′ to κ′(1 − s) for x > 0. For this proﬁle, we are seeking

a root ps with a positive real part Re(ps) > 0, a(x, t)
would grow exponentially with a growth rate of Re(ps).
When s > 1, the well behaved solution of a(x, p) for
x > 0 is φ1+(x, s, p) = DiΛ/(s−1)(z1+) where z1+ =
[pκ′(s − 1)x + ip(1/V1 − 1/V2)/pκ′(s − 1)]exp(−iπ/4).
The corresponding form of the denominator W1(s, p) =

The

The density gradient change s must be above a

the threshold, Re(ps) = 0.
The imaginary part,
Im(ps), physically represents the frequency of a1. We
can estimate if from the asymptotic solution of a1 ∝
exp[iκ′α2(x − V1t)2/2(1 + α)2], where α = −V2/V1 [7,
23, 24]. The characteristic frequency is ωa1 = −Im(ps) =

where the prime stands for the derivative of the parabolic
cylinder function and the threshold st only depends on
Λ. The relation of st and Λ is plotted in Figure 2(b) and
can be ﬁtted with st(Λ) = exp(−0.35Λ2 − 1.1Λ − 0.1).
This shows even for a low Λ = 1, st = 0.21 is enough to
induce absolute modes.

Numerically solving W (p) = 0 (0 < s < 1) and
W1(p) = 0 (s > 1), we obtain the TPD growth rates
vs s (Fig. 2(c)). The results agree well with the direct
numerical integration of Eqs.(2), validating the analysis.
The growth rate maxes at s = 1, corresponding to a ho-
mogeneous plasma at x > 0 in Figure 2(a). The max
growth rate at s ≈ 1.0 is close to the temporal growth
rate of the absolute mode in a fully homogeneous plasma
with the initial condition of a delta function [23]. When
s > 1, the absolute growth rate decays slowly.

For the case of density gradient increasing, i.e., s <
0, the model is equivalent to a gradient reduction of
|s|/(1 + |s|) and a new gain parameter Λ/(1 + |s|). This
shows that increasing the gradient is less eﬀective to in-
duce the absolute modes. For our TPD case, the ab-
solute instability generated by gradient increasing has a
much higher threshold st = −1.5 and lower growth rate
γ = 0.16γ0 for s = −10 compared with density gradient
reduction where st = 0.29 and γ = 0.7γ0 for s = 1.

For the sinusoidal density modulation cases in Fig.1(a),
we have not been able to develop a theory but the physics
is similar. The modulations change the density gradient
as well. For the sinusoidal modulations, every combina-
tion of ∆n and Lm corresponds to a gradient change by
s = km/(Lmκ′) = ∆n/[6v2
eLmκ′(1/k1 + 1/k2)] where ve
is the plasma thermal velocity. This allows us to compare
the sinusoidal case with the two-line case. The threshold
for the sinusoidal case in general depends on km and Lm,
not only on km/Lm, for a particular Λ. However, for
each Λ, there exists a minimum modulation amplitude
km(∆n) for the conversion threshold. The combination
of this km and its corresponding Lm gives an st very close
to the two-line model [Fig. 2(b)]. We also compare the
absolute growth rates in Fig. 2(c). When ∆n is ﬁxed and
Lm is allowed to vary (the case in Fig. 1(d)), the sinu-
soidal results agrees well with the two-line model when
s < 1 and has a 15% higher growth rate when s > 1.
When Lm is ﬁxed and ∆n is allowed to vary (the case in
Fig. 1(c)) the agreement is less well but the maximum
growth rate still agrees. Therefore the two-line model
can be used to assess the maximum growth rates of the
density-modulation-induced absolute modes for a given
density proﬁle.

For SRS[22], γ0 = k1v0qω2

p/(ω1ω2)/4 in Eqs.(2).
Since one daughter wave is an electromagnetic wave with
a much higher group velocity, the gain parameter Λ is
much smaller than in TPD for same laser and plasma
conditions. For the particular case discussed above, SRS
would not turn absolute under realistic density modu-
lations. However, in the ignition phase of shock igni-
tion, a new high-gain ignition scheme [12], the laser in-
tensity is signiﬁcantly higher and absolute SRS can be
induced. At ne = 0.22nc, the SRS match condition gives
V1 = 0.0387c, V2 = −0.39c and κ′ = 0.0021(ω0/c)2. For
a laser intensity of I = 2 × 1015W/cm2, γ0 = 0.0033ω0

4

and Λ = 0.38. The growth rate vs s for SRS in the two-
line model is plotted in Fig. 2(d), showing a threshold at
st = 0.56 and a maximum growth rate of 1.76 × 10−3ω0
at s = 1. Two cases with the sinusoidal modulations, one
with a ﬁxed Lm = 1.9µm and the other with a ﬁxed ∆n =
4.7×10−3nc (typical values from the PIC simulation[14]),
are also plotted. They both show the existence of ab-
solute SRS with peak growth rates of 1.5 × 10−3ω0 .
At shock ignition intensities, these density-modulation-
induced absolute SRS can dominate over TPD at low
densities since the later suﬀers stronger Landau damp-
ing. For example, for a I = 8 × 1015W/cm2 at 0.18nc,
Λ = 1 for SRS. Our theory predicts a low threshold
st = 0.21 and a max growth rate of 0.0038ω0. These
SRS can suppress TPD near n = 0.25nc through pump
depletion. This qualitatively agrees with the experimen-
tal results [13], where the backscattered SRS level in-
creases signiﬁcantly when the laser intensity increases.
Moreover, these SRS modes’ growth relies on the den-
sity modulations, which are ﬁrst generated by the TPD
and high frequency hybrid modes [21] near n = 0.25nc.
This coupling between the modes at diﬀerent density re-
gions may provide an explanation for the intermittent
LPI behaviors observed in the PIC simulations for shock
ignition [14].

The two-line density proﬁle in Fig. 2(a) were observed
in previous experiments with layered targets[25]. For the
parameters in [25], the required laser intensity for the
gradient-change-induced absolute SRS and TPD are 4 ×
1015W/cm2 and 8 × 1014W/cm2, respectively. Therefore
it is possible to experimentally test the theory here.

In summary, we found a suﬃcient change of the density
gradient in a linear density proﬁle can turn convective in-
stabilities into absolute ones. An analytical expression is
given for the threshold of the density gradient change,
which depends on the convective gain only. This theory
can explain ﬂuid simulations where a static sinusoidal
density modulation is superimposed on a linear density
proﬁle and the same convective-to-absolute conversion is
also observed. This conversion can occur for TPD and
SRS instabilities under realistic direct-drive ICF condi-
tions and can aﬀect hot electron generation and laser
energy deposition. The results show that it is important
to consider density modulation-induced modes when as-
sessing LPI in ICF.
