Abstract

A nonlinear dynamical system model that approximates a microscopic Gibbs ﬁeld model for the yielding of a
viscoplastic material subjected to varying external stress recently reported in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015) is
presented. The predictions of the model are in a fair agreement with the microscopic simulations and in a very
good agreement with the micro-structural semi-empirical model reported in Putz and Burghelea (2009). With only
two internal parameters, the nonlinear dynamical system model captures several key features of the solid-ﬂuid tran-
sition observed in experiments: the eﬀect of the interactions between microscopic constituents on the yield point,
the abruptness of solid-ﬂuid transition and the emergence of a hysteresis of the micro-structural states upon increas-
ing/decreasing external forcing.The scaling behaviour of the magnitude of the hysteresis with the degree of the steadi-
ness of the ﬂow is consistent with previous experimental observations.

1. Introduction

A broad class of materials exhibit a dual response when subjected to an external tress. For low applied stresses they
behave as solids (loosely speaking they may deform but they do not ﬂow) but, if the stress exceeds a critical threshold
generally referred to as the “yield stress”, they behave as ﬂuids (typically non-Newtonian) and a macroscopic ﬂow is
observed. This distinct class of materials has been termed as “yield stress ﬂuids”. During the past several decades one
could notice an increasing level of interest of both theoreticians and experimentalists in yield stress. This has a two-
fold motivation. From a practical standpoint, such materials have found a signiﬁcant number of applications in several
industries (which include food, cosmetical, pharmaceutical, oil ﬁeld engineering, etc.) and they are encountered in
daily life in various forms such as food pastes, hair gels and emulsions, cement, mud etc.. More recently, hydrogels
which exhibit a yield stress have found a number of future promising applications including targeted drug delivery
Han et al. (1997); Qiu and Park (2001), contact lenses, noninvasive intervertebral disc repair Hou et al. (2004) and
tissue engineering Beck et al. (2007).

From a fundamental standpoint, yield stress materials continue triggering intensive debates and posing diﬃcult
challenges to both theoreticians and experimentalists from various communities: soft matter physics, rheology, phys-
ical chemistry and applied mathematics. The progress in understanding the ﬂow behaviour of yield stress materials
made the object of several review papers Nguyen and Boger (1992); Coussot (2014); Balmforth et al. (2014); Bonn
et al. (2015). The best known debate concerning the yield stress materials is undoubtedly that related to the very
existence of a ”true” yield stress behaviour Barnes (1999); Barnes and Walters (1985). During the past two decades,
however, a number of innovative improvements in the rheometric equipment made possible measurements of torques
as small as 0.1nNm and rates of deformation as small as 10−7 s−1). Such accurate rheological measurements proved
unequivocally the existence of a true yielding behaviour Moller et al. (2009); Putz and Burghelea (2009); Bonn and
Denn (2009); Denn and Bonn (2011). The physics of the yielding process itself on the other hand remains elusive.
The macroscopic response of yield stress ﬂuids subjected to an external stress σ has been classically described by the
Herschel-Bulkely model Herschel and Bulkley (1926a,b):

(1)
Here σy is the yield stress, ˙γ is the rate of shear, i.e., the rate at which the material is being deformed, σ is the
macroscopically applied stress (the external forcing parameter), K is a so-called consistency parameter that sets the
viscosity scale in the ﬂowing state and N is the power law index which characterises the degree of shear thinning of
the viscosity beyond the yield point.

σ = σy + K ˙γN

In spite of its wide use by rheologists, ﬂuid dynamicists and engineers, the Herschel-Bulkley model (and its
regularised variants, e.g. Papanastasiou Papanastasiou (1987)) is in fact applicable only for a limited number of yield
stress materials, suﬃciently far from the solid-ﬂuid transition, i.e. when σ > σy, and in the conditions of a steady state
forcing, i.e. when a constant external stress σ is applied over a long period of time.

Thixotropy, which may be loosely understood 1 as a time dependence of the rheological parameters which results
from a competition between destruction and rejuvenation of the soft material units subjected to stress, is considered
to be a major reason for the departure from this simple yielding picture M¨oller et al. (2006). It has been recently
suggested that a number of diﬃculties concerning the yielding behaviour of yield stress materials could be solved if a
clear distinction between thixotropic and non-thixotropic yield stress ﬂuids is made Moller et al. (2009).

However, it has been shown recently that a clear departure from the Herschel-Bulkley behaviour can be observed
even for non-thixotropic yield stress ﬂuids such as the Carbopol gels particularly during either controlled stressed
rheological tests Putz and Burghelea (2009); Moyers-Gonzalez et al. (2011); Weber et al. (2012); Divoux et al. (2011,
2013) or hydrodynamically “simple” ﬂow problems such as a creeping motion of a spherical object Putz et al. (2008),
the unsteady laminar pipe ﬂow Poumaere et al. (2014) or the emergence of the Rayleigh-B´enard convection, Kebiche
et al. (2014) in a yield stress ﬂuid heated from below.

To overcome these diﬃculties, several phenomenological macroscopic models have been proposed Dullaert and
Mewis (2006); Quemada (1998a,b, 1999); Coussot et al. (2002a,b); Roussel et al. (2004); Putz and Burghelea (2009);

1A universal consensus on the deﬁnition of thixotropy has not yet been reached, Chapter 9.2 in Ref. Tropea et al. (2007) provides as many as 7

alternative deﬁnitions.

de Souza Mendes (2009, 2011); Dimitriou et al. (2013); Dimitriou and McKinley (2014); Blackwell and Ewoldt
(2014) which have a general form 2:

d¯a(t)
dt

= F [¯a(t), σ(t), C1, C2, ..., Cm]

(2)

The particular feature of these models is that they describe the temporal evolution of a microstructural parameter
¯a(t) as a function of the applied stress and a number of parameters C1, ..., Cm. Part of these parameters describe the
kinetics of the destruction/restructuration of the material and are diﬃcult (or impossible!) to measure. The rest of
the parameters are measurable via adequate macroscopic rheological tests (ﬂow ramps, oscillatory measurements,
creep/relaxation tests etc.). Thus, as the applied stress is increased, a(t) varies smoothly from 1 (the entire volume of
material is in a solid state) to 0 (the entire volume of material is in a ﬂuid state) and the combined solid and ﬂuid rheo-
logical responses are accounted for accordingly into a constitutive relation. Finally, the problem is reduced to a system
of coupled equation which can be solved either analytically if the structural evolution equation is suﬃciently simple
(see for example the λ model proposed by Coussot in Coussot et al. (2002b), Roussel et al. (2004)) or numerically.

Such approaches have several clear indisputable advantages and have contributed signiﬁcantly to our current

understanding of yield stress materials:

1. As opposed to the Bingham and the Herschel-Bulkley models which predict an abrupt and discontinuous solid-
ﬂuid transition when a jumps from 1 to 0 at a well-deﬁned value of the applied stress which coincides with
the yield stress σ = σy, such approaches which directly account for the evolution of a(t) are able to predict a
smooth (gradual) solid-ﬂuid transition which is often observed in experiments Putz and Burghelea (2009).

2. From the point of view of a rheologist, these models are quite versatile, as with a minimal readjustment of
the parameters they can model various types of tests: ﬂow ramps Putz and Burghelea (2009), small amplitude
oscillations (SAOS) Putz and Burghelea (2009), large amplitude oscillatory ﬂows (LAOS) Putz and Burghelea
(2009); Dimitriou and McKinley (2014); Blackwell and Ewoldt (2014) and creep/relaxation ﬂows.

3. They can ﬂexibly model the irreversibility of the deformation states when the applied stresses are increased/decreased

around the solid-ﬂuid transition. Moreover, they can quantitatively describe the experimentally observed rhe-
ological hysteresis and the dependence of its magnitude on the degree of steadiness of the forcing Putz and
Burghelea (2009) as reﬂected by the area of the hysteresis of the dependence ˙γ = σ (˙γ), on the degree of the
steadiness of the external forcing (i.e. how fast is the external stress varied about the solid-ﬂuid transition).

4. From a practical standpoint, they are relatively easy to implement.

Though able to model suﬃciently complex rheological data (ranging from controlled stress/strain unsteady ﬂow
ramps, creep tests and oscillatory tests in a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes), such phenomenological macro-
scopic models do have a number of limitations:

1. As the functional dependence F in Eq. 2 is generally chosen on an intuitive basis rather derived from ﬁrst

principles, these models can teach little about the microscopic scale physics of the yielding process.

2. They typically involve a rather large number of parameters some of which are not directly and easily measurable

and can be obtained only by ﬁtting the experimental data.

3. Second, such models are not inherently validated from a thermodynamical standpoint. The second law of
thermodynamics is not guaranteed to be held and such a validation is not always straightforward as it requires
the derivation of a thermodynamic potential Picard et al. (2002); Bautista et al. (2009); Hong et al. (2008).

Bearing in mind that the yield stress behaviour originates from the presence of a “soft” microstructure which can
only sustain a ﬁnite local stress prior to its breakdown, an alternative way of assessing the dynamics of the yielding
process is to focus on the evolution of the micro-structural soft material units as the external stress is gradually
increased past the solid-ﬂuid transition and next to assess the macroscopic scale behaviour from the perspective of
statistical mechanics. A thermodynamic approach for the deformation of a physical gel has been recently proposed
by An and coworkers An et al. (2010). By using a mean ﬁeld approach, they construct a free energy functional and

describe the microscopic scale dynamics of the gel network as a function of the applied stress in terms of the monomer
volume fraction and an internal connectivity tensor characterising the gel network. Peshkov and his coworkers have
employed the irreversible mechanics and thermodynamics of two-phase continua to describe the yielding process but a
comparison with the experimental data seems to require future developments Peshkov et al. (2014). de Bruyn (2013)
has modelled the restricted diﬀusion of small tracer particles in heterogeneous media by performing Monte Carlo
simulations in a site-percolation model and his results partially agreed with the experimental observations Oppong
et al. (2006); Oppong and de Bruyn (2007).

More recently, we have proposed in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015) a microscopic picture of yielding inspired
from the Ising model of magnetisation of a ferromagnet Ising (1925); Stanley (1987). The model was built on an
analogy between the local agglomerative interactions in terms of assembly/disassembly of neighbouring microscopic
constituents in a yield stress material subjected to an external stress and the local ferromagnetic interactions in terms of
spin up (+1) / spin down (−1) of neighbouring particles in a microscopic ferromagnetic system subjected to an external
magnetic ﬁeld. First, our approach is fundamentally probabilistic and formalises Gibbs ﬁelds as time-homogeneous
and time-inhomogeneous Markov chains over the state space of all microscopic conﬁgurations and thus it is thermo-
dynamically validated. Second, the model has solely two parameters. Though able to capture several key physical
features of the solid-ﬂuid transition, from a practical perspective the applicability of this model to describe rheological
measurements and real ﬂow problems is somewhat limited. First, the microscopic constituents are assumed ﬁxed over
a lattice while the external stress is varied and thus there exists no direct of equivalent of the rate of deformation ˙γ.
Second, as it is a statistical model, its implementation is not trivial and its usage is time consuming. The aim of the
current contribution is to derive an approximation of the model in the form of a classical structural approach similar to
Eq. 2 which, together with the appropriate constitutive equation could ultimately describe rheological measurements.
The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we provide a brief description of the microscopic Gibbs ﬁeld approach
introduced in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015) with a particular emphasis on its main predictions. A diﬀerential
equation approximating the expected solid fraction of the material in the Gibbs model is derived and analysed in
Sec. 3. The results of the simulations according to the microscopic model and the expected trajectories from the
approximating diﬀerential equation are presented in Sec. 4. The paper concludes in Sec. 5 with a discussion of the
main ﬁndings, their impact and their possible implications and extensions.

2. The microscopic Gibbs ﬁeld model

First we present a summary of the microscopic Gibbs Field model by Sainudiin et. al. R. Sainudiin and Burghelea
(2015). We model an idealised yield stress material or viscoplastic ﬂuid as a network of particles in an appropriate sol-
vent that are capable of assembling by “forming bonds” or disassembling by ”breaking bonds” with their neighbours
when an external stress σ is applied. As already mentioned in the introduction, this approach is inspired by the Ising
model of ferromagnetism and its advantage is that, once formulated, it can fully beneﬁt from the already developed
tools of Statistical Physics Stanley (1987); Landau and Lisfshits (1980).
We investigate the model when the network of particles is the regular graph given by the toroidal two-dimensional
square lattice. Let xs ∈ Λ = {0, 1} denote the phase at site s. Phase 0 corresponds to being yielded or ungelled
and phase 1 corresponds to being unyielded or gelled. The phase at a site directly aﬀects its connectability with its
neighbuoring sites. We assume that only two gelled sites can be connected with one another.

We consider the following Gibbs potential over the two types of cliques:

V{s}(x) = (σ − α)xs =

σ − α

if xs = 0
if xs = 1,

and

V(cid:104)s,r(cid:105)(x) = −βxsxr =

if (xs, xr) = (0, 1)

where {s} is the singleton clique, (cid:104)s, r(cid:105) is the doubleton clique with r ∈ Ns (the set of four nearest neighbouring
sites of a given site s), σ ≥ 0 is the external stress applied, α ≥ 0 is the site-speciﬁc threshold, and β ∈ (−∞,∞) is the
interaction constant between neighbouring sites. It is important to note that the ”stress” σ has actually the dimensions
of an energy transferred to the lattice which is an obvious consequence of the fact that the sites in the lattice are ﬁxed
and there is no equivalent of a deformation γ of the lattice.

Using the Gibbs potentials deﬁned above one can write the associated energy of a site conﬁguration as:

As expected, the energy function above is very similar to the Ising Hamiltonian, Ising (1925); Stanley (1987).
Here the external stress σ is the analogue of an external magnetic ﬁeld and the interaction parameter parameter β
plays the role of the coupling between neighbouring magnetic spins.

and θ = θ(s, α, β, σ), is indeed a function of the site s and the three parameters: α, β and σ. By ||x − x(cid:48)|| = 1 we mean
s. Similarly, by ||x − x(cid:48)|| = 0 we mean that the two
that the conﬁgurations x and x(cid:48) diﬀer at exactly site s, i.e., xs (cid:44) x(cid:48)
s at every site s ∈ Sn. We can think of our Markov chain evolving
conﬁgurations are identical, i.e., x = x(cid:48) or xs = x(cid:48)
according to the following probabilistic rules based on (9) and (10):

• given the current conﬁguration x, we ﬁrst choose one of the n2 sites in Sn uniformly at random with probability

n−2,

• denote this chosen site by s and let the number of bondable neighbors of s be i = Ns(x) ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, and
• ﬁnally change the phase at s to 1, i.e., set xs = 1 with probability

pi := (1 + θ)−1 = (1 + θ(s, α, β, σ))−1 = 1/(1 + e(σ−α−iβ))

(13)

and set xs = 0 with probability 1 − pi.

We emphasise the dependence of pi on the parameters α, β and σ by pi(α, β, σ). This is plotted in Fig. 1 for
diﬀerent parameter values. From the plots it is clear that α is a location parameter while β controls the scale of the
relative diﬀerence between pi’s.

Similarly, two informative doubleton clique statistics of a conﬁguration x are the number and fraction of connected

pairs of neighboring sites, given respectively by:

b(x) :=

y(cid:104)s,r(cid:105) =

xrxs

and

b(x) := |En|−1b(x) =

When the conﬁguration is a function of time m and given by x(m), then the corresponding conﬁguration statistics
are also functions of time and are given by: a(m) = a(x(m)), a(m) = a(x(m)), b(m) = b(x(m)) and b(m) = b(x(m)).
The energy of a conﬁguration x can be succinctly expressed in terms of a(x) and b(x) as
E(x) = −βb(x) + (σ − α)a(x) = −β2n2b(x) + (σ − α)n2a(x) ,

values of α, β. p0 (full line), p1 (–), p2 (..), p3 (-.-) and p4 (bold line).

and therefore

E(x) ∝ −2βb(x) + (σ − α)a(x) = −2βb(x) + ˜σa(x) ,

(14)
where β ∈ (−∞,∞) and ˜σ = σ − α ≥ −α for a given α ≥ 0. Since the energy of a conﬁguration x, given n, only
depends on its a(x) and b(x), we can easily visualize any sample path ( x(0), . . . , x(m) ) ∈ Xm+1
in conﬁguration space
that is outputted by either Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2 presented in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015) as the following
sequence of (m + 1) ordered pairs in the unit square:

Finally, we reserve upper-case letters for random variables. Thus, A(X), A(X), B(X) and B(X) are the statistics of
the random conﬁguration X. And the notation naturally extends to A(m), A(m), B(m) and B(m) when X(m) is a random
conﬁguration at time m.

2.4. The main predictions of the Gibbs ﬁeld model for the yielding of a yield stress material

The Gibbs ﬁeld model has been tested by monitoring the evolution of the volume fraction of the solid microscopic
constituents ¯a(t) during increasing/decreasing linearly stepped stress ramp that mimics a rheological ﬂow ramp, see
Putz and Burghelea (2009); Moyers-Gonzalez et al. (2011); Weber et al. (2012). In the context of the Gibbs ﬁeld
model, the closest equivalent of the characteristic forcing time t0 or the time the stress is maintained constant during
a controlled stress stepped ramped is the average number of hits per lattice site h in the Gibbs algorithm.

Corresponding to each step of the ramp the stress was kept constant during a time t0 and the volume fraction
of un-yielded lattice sites was obtained via the Gibbs algorithm detailed in the Appendix of Ref. R. Sainudiin and
Burghelea (2015). By varying the characteristic forcing time t0 we could test the dependence of the microscopic
yielding dynamics on the degree of steadiness of the external forcing and attempt a qualitative comparison with the
experimental results referred to in Sec. 1.

In spite of its very limited number of parameters, we have shown that this model can capture several key features

of the solid-ﬂuid transition:

9

1. In the limit of a steady state external forcing (t0 very large), the solid-ﬂuid transition is reversible upon increas-
ing/decreasing applied stresses only if the interaction parameter β does not exceed a critical threshold βc, see
Figs. 10 (a,b) in Ref. R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015). Beyond this threshold a “genuine” micro-structural
hysteresis is observed even in the asymptotic limit of a steady state forcing, see Figs. 10 (c,d) in Ref. R. Sain-
udiin and Burghelea (2015).

2. During unsteady ﬂow ramps (t0 ﬁnite) a micro-structural hysteresis is observed even in the absence of inter-
action (β = 0). The dependence of the magnitude of the hysteresis on t0 is non monotonic, see Figs. 11 in
−ξ
Ref. R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015). At large t0 it scales as a power law t
0 with ξ decreasing as the inter-
action parameter β increases which is qualitatively similar the experimentally observed rheological hysteresis
behaviour Putz and Burghelea (2009); Moyers-Gonzalez et al. (2011); Weber et al. (2012) For highly unsteady
stress ramps (small t0) the magnitude of the hysteresis follows a log-normal correlation which is equally con-
sistent with the experimental scaling measured during rheological tests Divoux et al. (2013).

To conclude this part, we have been able to qualitatively describe several main features of the solid-ﬂuid transi-
tion experimentally observed for yield stress materials subjected to an external stress using a Gibbs ﬁeld statistical
approach with only two internal parameters. This motivates us to derive in the following an approximate continuous
version of this model which is similar in form to the classical micro-structural approaches generally described by
Eq. 2 but remains thermodynamically validated.

3. An Approximating Nonlinear Dynamical System

Here we derive a nonlinear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation to asymptotically approximate E(A(t)), the expected
fraction of sites in the solid phase, in continuous time t that is measured in units of n2 discrete time-steps as the number
of sites n2 → ∞, under a ﬁxed externally applied stress σ and ﬁxed rheological parameters α and β.

conﬁguration of the chain at discrete time m and A(m) =(cid:80)

First consider the discrete-time Markov chain {X(m)}∞

m=0 of (11) and (12) and recall that X(m) is the random site
s Xs(m) is the number of sites that are in phase 1. We will

derive the approximation ﬁrst for the case when β = 0 in (12) and then for the general setting of β (cid:44) 0.

3.1. Non-interactive case with β = 0

If β = 0 then the probability of the phase in site s at the next time-step is independent of the current conﬁguration,

i.e.,

Pr{Xs(m + 1) = xs(m + 1)| X(m) = x(m)}

= Pr{Xs(m + 1) = xs(m + 1)}

=

p = (1 + eσ−α)−1

0

if xs(m + 1) = 1
if xs(m + 1) = 0
if xs(m + 1) (cid:60) {0, 1} .

Therefore, the probability that the total number of sites in phase 1 increases by 1 in one time-step is obtained by

10

adding the probability of a transition from phase 0 to phase 1 over every uniformly chosen site s as follows:

Pr{A(m + 1) = a(m) + 1| A(m) = a(m)}

Now we can deﬁne a continuous-time Markov chain {A(t)}t≥0 on the unit interval [0, 1] by a rescaling of the
discrete-time Markov chain {A(m)}∞
m=0 and letting the number of sites n2 → ∞. These two Markov chains are no-
tationally distinguished only by their time indices. The rescaled time t is m in units of n2, i.e., m = (cid:98)tn2(cid:99) and
m + 1 = (cid:98)(t + 1/n2)n2(cid:99). Then by taking ∆t = O(1/n2) and letting

∆A = A(t + ∆t) − a(t) = A((cid:98)(t + ∆t)n2(cid:99)) − a((cid:98)tn2(cid:99)) ,

Finally by considering the instantaneous rate of change of the expected fraction of sites in phase 1

we get the limiting diﬀerential equation approximation as

based on (15) as follows:

˙a =

a(t) = p(1 − a(t)) − (1 − p)a(t) = p − a(t) ,

or simply by

(16)
The simple relationship above is mathematically very similar to the so called “lambda-model” introduced in Cous-
sot et al. (2002a,b) with the remark that we consider the stress σ as a forcing parameter rather than the rate of defor-
mation.

˙a = p − a = (1 + eσ−α)−1 − a .

Given the initial condition a(0) = a0, the analytic solution is

a(t) = p + (a0 − p)e−t = (1 + eσ−α)−1 + (a0 − (1 + eσ−α)−1)e−t

with only one asymptotically stable ﬁxed point

a∗ = p = (1 + eσ−α)−1 .

(17)

Thus, a(t) in the above diﬀerential equation is the expected fraction of sites in phase 1 at time t in the limit of an
inﬁnite toroidal square lattice with |Sn| = n2 → ∞ and a realization of the continuous time Markov chain {A(t)}t≥0 is
a(t).

Since β = 0, the probability of a site being in a given phase is independent of the phases of its neighboring sites.
Thus, we can obtain b(t), the expected fraction of bonds, by simply multiplying a(t), the probability of ﬁnding a
randomly chosen site in phase 1, by itself, i.e.,

b(t) = a(t)2 and b

3.2. Interactive case with β (cid:44) 0

sites of s at time m through XNs(m) =(cid:80)

If β (cid:44) 0 then the probability of site s being in phase 1 at time m+1 depends on the conﬁguration of the neighboring

r∈Ns Xr(m), the number of neighboring sites of s in phase 1 at time m.

Pr{Xs(m + 1) = xs(m + 1)| X(m) = x(m)}

This simpliﬁes after factoring and extracting coeﬃcients of a as follows:

−4 (p0 − 3 p1 + 3 p2 − p3)a3
+(p0 − 4 p1 + 6 p2 − 4 p3 + p4)a4 .

(19)

We can understand (19) directly as a quartic polynomial in a whose coeﬃcients are given by an alternating bi-
nomial series corresponding to the increase and decrease in a based on a combinatorial averaging over the transition
diagram of site conﬁgurations at the four nearest neighbors of a given site. Next we characterize the qualitative asymp-
totic dynamics of the above nonlinear diﬀerential equation which reduces to the diﬀerential equation (16) if β = 0 and
thereby p = p0 = p1 = p2 = p3 = p4.

If the externally applied stress σ is beyond α by 2β, i.e.

˜σ = σ − α = 2β ,

then the probability of being in phase 1 or phase 0 at a site that is surrounded by two neighbors in phase 1 and the
other two in phase 0 is equal and exactly half:

p2 =

1

1 + exp( ˜σ − 2( ˜σ/2))

=

= 1 − p2 .

If we study the system along ˜σ = 2β, the symmetric set of parameters, then

p1 + p3 =

and also

p0 + p4 =

Thus, the coeﬃcient of a4 in (19) vanishes when ˜σ = 2β:

p0 − 4 p1 + 6 p2 − 4 p3 + p4 = (p0 + p4) − 4(p1 + p3) + 6p2 = 0 .

Therefore, along ˜σ = 2β our (19) is really just a cubic function of a as opposed to a quartic. The discriminant of this
cubic is

In the left panel of Fig. 3, we present three diﬀerent stability scenarios for the ﬁxed points of equation (19) in

them is in [0, 1], this ﬁxed point is stable. (ii) In the yellow region, starting at point (2.589145, 1.2945725), we have
four distinct real roots with three of them in [0, 1]. Only one of the three distinct real roots is an unstable ﬁxed point
while the other two roots are stable ﬁxed points. This naturally corresponds to a family of pitch-fork bifurcations
and the associated hysteresis depending on where the system is initialised from. (iii) The unshaded region in the left

the existence of two real roots (with one of them in [0, 1], stable ﬁxed point) and two complex conjugate roots.

corresponding to the central shaded region of Fig. 3 containing the line β = ˜σ/2 is evident in Fig. 4 with three ﬁxed

the cubic discriminant of Fig. 2 along the black line in Fig. 3 is displayed to highlight the dynamics with one unstable
ﬁxed point at 1/2 and two other stable ﬁxed points that are equidistant on either side of 1/2.
We are interested in varying the externally applied stress σ for a given material characterized by ﬁxed rheological
parameters α and β. This amounts to varying ˜σ for a ﬁxed β since the ﬁxed α is absorbed into ˜σ = σ − α. The
asymptotic dynamics when we apply a constant external stress for a long period of time are given by the ﬁxed points a∗
in Fig. 4. We study such stress-dependent behavior from the Gibbs sampler and compare it with ODE approximation
in the next Section. Note that the ODE model for β (cid:44) 0 is only in qualitative agreement with a(t), the expected
volume fraction of the unyielded material at time t. This is because we are ignoring the dependent statistic b(t), the
expected fraction of bonds or pairs of neighboring unyielded material at time t. Despite this simpliﬁcation, as we will
see in Sec. 4, there is qualitative agreement between the ODE and the Gibbs simulations. Furthermore, an admittedly
ad hoc correction of the ODE through a translation of the vector ﬁeld by (α0, β0) even improves the quantitative
approximation. We postpone a formal quantitative approximation of the ODE using perturbation theoretic methods to
the future and focus here on obtaining insights from the Gibbs sampler that is in qualitative agreement with the ODE
approximation.

4. Results

In this Section we mainly obtain various insights about the macroscopic behaviour of our model based on Monte
Carlo simulations from Algorithms 1 and 2 in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015), and make some comparisons with
the approximating nonlinear ODE model of Sec. 3.

4.1. Comparison between Microscopic model and ODE approximation under varying stress

The energy of X(t), the random site conﬁguration at time t, depends on two of its highly correlated statistics: A(t),
the random fraction of gelled sites at time t, and B(t), the random fraction of connected sites at time t. One of our
primary interests is to study A(t) and B(t) as X(t) is under the inﬂuence of time-varying externally applied stress σ(t).
Using Monte Carlo simulations from Algorithm 2 in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015) of the time-inhomogeneous
Markov chain {X(m)}Mh
m=0, under a time-dependent stress σ ramp, we can obtain multiple independent trajectories of
A(σ), the fraction of gelled sites as a function of the external stress σ. This is to emulate conditions of an unsteady
forcing during macroscopic rhelogical measurements. In the following, h is the average hits per site in the Gibbs sam-
pler algorithm and we deﬁne it also as the characteristc forcing time t0 for the stress ramp in our ODE simulations.
We set h = 1000 in order to reach steady state for each value of σ. In Figure 5, the trajectories are shown as thin lines
and the curves for the ODE approximation have the (cid:3) symbol on them. Note the reversibility of the response of the
material when β ∈ {0, 1} (top row of Figure 5) upon increasing/decreasing applied stresses. The microscopic model
and the ODE approximation quantitatively agree quite well when β < βc (βc ≈ 1.3), the threshold for three ﬁxed
points in [0, 1] for the ODE model. As we increase β beyond the aforementioned threshold βc we see that irreversible
behaviour in the material appears and the comparison between the two models (discrete and continuous) is only quali-
tative in nature. This is due to the fact that our ODE approximation only models a, instead of modelling the dependent
pair (a, b) that is suﬃcient for the energy, see Sec. 2.3. This eﬀect can also bee seen if we compare the right panel
of Fig. 3 with Fig. 8(c) in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015). Clearly the light region of Fig. 8c (R. Sainudiin and
Burghelea (2015)) corresponds to the yellow region where hysteresis is always present. The main discrepancy is the
value of βc. In our ODE approximation, the calculated value is βc ≈ 1.3, on the other hand, from our Gibbs sampler

As a qualitative remark one can note that even in the presence of strong interactions β > βc, both models predict
an increase of the steepness of the solid ﬂuid transition (deﬁned as the slope of the dependence ¯a(t) on σ around the
point where ¯a ≈ 1/2).

4.2. Comparison between model by Putz and Burghelea Putz and Burghelea (2009) and ODE approximation

In this section we will consider the model developed by Putz and coworkers in Putz and Burghelea (2009); Moyers-
Gonzalez et al. (2011). This model is phenomenological in the sense that, unlike the Gibbs ﬁeld model presented in
Sec. 2 it is not derived from ﬁrst principles. In this type of modelling one mimics the behaviour of the microstructure
through the deﬁnition of a macroscopic structural variable with range in [0, 1], where 0 means completely unstructured
or ﬂuid and 1 means completely structured or solid. The structural variable ap satisﬁes a kinematic equation and
usually depends explicitly on the stress and/or rate of strain. In the case of Putz and Burghelea (2009) we have:

where kr is the rate of recombination of micro-structural units, kd is the rate of destruction of the solid phase, σy
is the yield stress and w is a constant that controls how steep the change in the microstructure from solid to ﬂuid and
ﬂuid to solid is.

In Figure 6 we present the simulations of equations (19) and (20) for three characteristic forcing times t0. As
expected we have very good agreement between the models. This could be considered as a qualitative ”proof ” that
the phenomenological models can actually approximate the behaviour of the microscopic models derived from ﬁrst
principles.

4.3. Determination of the yield point in the limit of a steady state forcing

A reliable estimation of the yield point is important to many practical applications involving yield stress ma-
terials.This is typically done by ﬁtting steady state rheological measurements with models with various degrees of

complexity ranging from the mathematically simple and classical Herschel-Bulkley correlation up to structural mod-
els. Thus, it appears natural to attempt in the following to obtain an estimate of the yield point for the case of a steady
state forcing from the nonlinear dynamical system model presented herein.

To get an approximation for the yield point σy during a steady state forcing process we will make the assumption
(well supported by the results presented in Figs. 5, 6) that, corresponding to the yield point, the absolute value of the
slope of the dependence ¯a∗(σ) passes through a maximum:

(21)

For simplicity, let us focus ﬁrst on the non-interacting case, β = 0. From Eq. 17 on can readily show that the
condition 21 reduces to σy = α. Thus, in the non-interactive case, the yield point obtained during a steady state
stressing practically coincides with the site speciﬁc threshold α of the Gibbs ﬁeld model.
We now consider the interactive case β (cid:44) 0. To a leading order in ¯a∗ and assuming that around the yield point
¯a∗ ≈ 1/2 it can be shown using Eq. 19:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 0. The result is presented in Fig. 7. For interactions weaker than the critical threshold βc,

The implicit dependence of the approximate yield stress ˜σy on the interaction parameter β may be obtained by
solving numerically
the apparent yield stress scales as ˜σy = σ − α = β (the dash-dotted line in Fig. 7). Beyond this threshold, the scaling
becomes steeper, ˜σy = σ − α = 2β (the dashed line in Fig. 7). To conclude this part, the yield stress assessed via
steady state controlled stress ramps is (according to our model) expected to depend linearly on both the site speciﬁc
threshold α which may be intuitively understood as a measure of the strength of the microscopic constituents of the
ﬂuid and the strength β of their interaction and the slope of this behaviour switches when the strength of the interaction
passes through the threshold β = βc.

Regardless the value of the interaction parameter the stress dependence of the slope passes through a local max-

yield point. While β increases, the location of this maximum shifts towards larger stress values as already illustrated

in Fig. 7. The value of this maximum slope increases monotonically with beta, the dashed line in Fig.8(a). As we ap-
proach βc the slope diverges Fig. 8(b). This is consistent with the fact that our steady solution becomes discontinuous
as a function of ˜σ. Recall that we have a pitchfork bifurcation with stable ﬁxed points {0, 1}, hence the value of σy is
not unique and depends on the initial condition.

4.4. Eﬀect of the characteristic forcing time t0 on the micro-structural hysteresis

In many practical situations the forcing time necessary to reach steady state in a given material cannot be reached.
Perhaps one of the simplest such situation is that of a millimetre sized spherical object falling slowly (speeds of order
of millimetres per second) in a Carbopol gel as investigated in Ref. Putz et al. (2008). The time scale associated to
such motion is simply the ratio of the object’s size to its speed and, in the case of the experiments reported inPutz et al.
(2008) was of the order of a second or shorter. To understand such hydrodynamic problems steady state rheological
measurements do not suﬃce.
In Ref. Putz and Burghelea (2009) the rheological response of Carbopol gel was
characterised during unsteady controlled stress linear ramps for various values of the holding time t0 per stress values.
A rheological hysteresis (which could, at least partially and qualitatively, explain the emergence of a fore-aft symmetry
breaking of the ﬂow pattern measured for the falling sphere experiment) was systematically found and its magnitude
scaled as t

0 with ξ ≈ 1, see Fig. 11 in Putz and Burghelea (2009).
−ξ

The purpose of this section is to study the dependance of the area of the hysteresis of the micro-structural states
observed upon increasing/decreasing forcing as a function of characteristic forcing time t0, compare the results with
the predictions of the Gibbs ﬁeld model R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015) and with the predictions of the predictions
of the structural model by Putz and Burghelea Moyers-Gonzalez et al. (2011) as well as with the experiments Putz
and Burghelea (2009); Divoux et al. (2013).

For this purpose, we have ﬁrst run simulations using the nonlinear dynamical system described in Sec. 3 corre-
sponding to several linear increasing/decreasing stress ramps for various values of the holding time per stress value t0
and several values of the interaction parameter β. For each case we have calculated the area of the micro-structural
hysteresis of the dependence ¯a(σ). The results obtained of the hysteresis area on the characteristic time t0 obtained
from the nonlinear dynamical system approach are represented in Fig. 9 as open symbols. For comparison, we cal-
culated the same dependence by running the Gibbs ﬁeld model for the same values of the interacting paramater and a
number of hits per site h that matches t0. The results are represented in Fig. 9 as full symbols. The results obtained
by the two approaches are in a good qualitative agreement: in both cases the magnitude of the microstructural hys-
teresis depends in a non-monotonic fashion on the degree of steadiness of the external forcing. In the steady state
limit of large t0 (h), a power law scaling in the form t
is observed. This ﬁnding is consistent with the experimental
observations of a rheological hysteresis for a Carbopol gel subjected to an increasing/decreasing linear stress ramp

results obtained via the two approaches is only partial. The biggest diﬀerences in the scaling behaviour (see the inset
in 9) are observed for the non-interactive case, β = 0 (the circles in Fig. 9). Eventhough that for the case β = 0 the
approximation is exact, one should note that the Gibbs model is discrete. We expect that as n → ∞ (recall that n2
is the number of sites in our lattice) the rate of decay in the hysteresis will converge to the value of the continuous
model. As the interaction parameter β is gradually increased, the quantitative agreement between the two approaches
improves (the circles, the squares and the rhombs). In all cases, however, the magnitude of the micro-structural hys-
−ξ
teresis scales as a power law with the characteristic forcing time, t
0 , see the inset in Fig. 9. It is noteworthy that
the values of the scaling exponent ξ are of the same order of magnitude as the ones measured experimentally in Putz
and Burghelea (2009). It is equally interesting to note that both approaches predict a decrease of the scaling exponent
with the interaction parameter. This ﬁnding is fully consistent with the experimental fact that, in the case of strongly
interacting systems (e.g. laponite and bentonite suspensions) the rheological measurements exhibit a hysteresis (and,
consequently, their reproducibility during subsequent tests is poor) even in the asymptotic case of a steady state forc-
ing (very large waiting times t0). More recently, a large hysteresis was systematically observed even for very large
values of t0 during controlled stress ramps performed with a suspension of a micro-alga with an electrically charged
cellular membrane, Souli`es et al. (2013).

In the case of a unsteady forcing i.e. small t0 the simulations based on both approaches reveal a local maximum
that shifts slightly towards larger values of t0 as the interaction parameter β increases. This ﬁnding is consistent with
the experimental results obtained by Divoux and his coworkers for three materials Divoux et al. (2013): a laponite
suspension, for a carbon black suspension and mayonnaise. For a Carbopol gel, however, this local maximum was
not observed neither in Putz and Burghelea (2009) (see Fig.11 therein) nor in Divoux et al. (2013) (see Fig. 3 (c)
therein) because, most probably, it occurs at characteristic forcing time t0 too small to be probed experimentally. An
additional insight into the physical nature of this non monotonic behaviour was given in R. Sainudiin and Burghelea
(2015) by showing that for values of t0 below the maximum the lattice is only partially yielded corresponding to the
maximal value of the stress reached during the ramp. Last, we compare the predictions of the nonlinear dynamical
system model with the predictions of the micro-structural model by Putz and Burghelea (the dotted line in Fig. 9),
Putz and Burghelea (2009). One can note a fair agreement with the result obtained for the non-interactive case β = 0.

5. Conclusions, outlook

We have presented a nonlinear dynamical system (ODE) approach for the solid ﬂuid transition of a yield stress
material subjected to an external stress that approximates the microscopic Gibbs ﬁeld formulated from ﬁrst principles
introduced in Ref. R. Sainudiin and Burghelea (2015).

In spite of some quantitative diﬀerences mainly due to the fact that the ODE approximation does not properly
account for the statistics of bonds between neighbouring microscopic constituents, both the ODE and the Gibbs ﬁeld
approach predict several key features of the solid-transition.

First, the transition is generally irreversible upon increasing/decreasing forcing an a micro-structural hysteresis
is systematically observed, Fig. 5. A reversible transition may be observed solely in the non-interacting case β = 0
and in the limit of a steady state forcing (the top left panel in Fig. 5). By a systematic analysis of the stability of the
ﬁxed points of the nonlinear dynamical system we could show that a genuine hysteresis will be observed even in the
asymptotic limit of steady forcing if the interaction parameter exceeds the threshold βc ≈ 1.3, (bottom panel in Fig. 5
). The magnitude of the micro-structural hysteresis depends on both the level of interactions between the microscopic
constituents and the degree of steadiness of the external forcing t0. In the limit of slow forcing the hysteresis decays
−ξ
as a power law t
0 , Fig. 9 and the power law exponents decreases with increasing strength of the interactions, the inset
in Fig. 9. The monotonic decrease of the scaling exponent with β implies that, when strong interactions among the
microscopic constituents are present, a strong irreversibility of the micro-structural states upon increasing/decreasing
stresses even in the asymptotic limit of a steady state forcing.

Second, the abruptness of the solid ﬂuid gradually increases with increasing interaction parameter β, Fig. 5.
Third, we remark that the Gibbs Simulations as well as the approximating ODE are in qualitative agreement with

the simple phenomenological model for the micro-structural hysteresis proposed in 6.

Fourth and equally important from a practical perspective, our model allows one to estimate the yield point and
monitor its behaviour as a function of the interaction parameter, Fig. 7. A linear dependence is found and its slope

changes corresponding to the critical point β = βc. When β > βc the value of the yield stress is no longer unique. This
due to the fact that the process is no longer reversible. The steepness of the yielding transition diverges at the critical
point β = βc, Fig. 8.

In closing, we believe there are several future directions worth pursuing. At a theoretical level, a more quantitative
comparison between these models aimed at highlighting their diﬀerences may be useful. Ideally, perturbation theoretic
methods should be used to improve the quantitative agreement between the nonlinear ODE model and the stochastic
trajectories as opposed to the ad-hoc translations of the vector ﬁeld done in this study. A more detailed model that
simultaneously represents the fraction of gelled sites and the fraction of bonds in one dependent system would provide
a better quantitative and qualitative approximation of the correlated site percolation model. Another interesting exten-
sion of our model could involve allowing for solvent eﬀects through a model akin to correlated site-bond percolation
of (Stauﬀer et al., 1982, Sec. D.II., p.136) but with our focus on external stress as opposed to temperature. In such a
model we have an additional parameter that allows for a site to be occupied by a monomer with probability φ and by
the solvent with probability 1 − φ.

From the more practical standpoint of the rheologist, it would be interesting to couple the nonlinear dynamical
system approach to an appropriate elasto-viscoplastic constitutive relation and attempt either ﬁtting experimental data
or modelling industrially relevant non rheometric ﬂow problems.
