Role of the membrane for mechanosensing by tethered channels

Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, USA

Benedikt Sabass and Howard A. Stone

Biologically important membrane channels are gated by force at attached tethers. Here, we gener-
ically characterize the non-trivial interplay of force, membrane tension, and channel deformations
that can aﬀect gating. A central ﬁnding is that minute conical channel deformation under force
leads to signiﬁcant energy release during opening. We also calculate channel-channel interactions
and show that they can amplify force sensitivity of tethered channels.

Introduction.– The conversion of mechanical signals
to a biochemical response is essential for living mat-
ter. One important class of mechanosensing proteins
are membrane channels that are required for numerous
biological functions, such as hearing [1], the sense of
touch [2], or regulation of intracellular mechanics [3]. Re-
cently, mechanosensitive channels have received consider-
able scientiﬁc attention, mostly with a focus on tension-
sensing [4, 5]. A fundamental insight was that membrane
energy is suﬃcient to cause channel deformations that
lead to gating, i.e. opening or closing of the channel.
As reviewed in [6], the deformation modes include con-
ical shape changes [7–11], radial expansion [12–15], or
changes in channel hydrophobic thickness [16, 17]. How-
ever, in many cases the channels are directly tethered
to cytoskeletal or extracellular structures, which allow a
direct transmission of mechanical force [18–20].

One example of a tethered channel is the DEG/ENaC
complex, which conveys touch sensing in C. elegans [21].
Here, an ion channel is likely opened by mechanical in-
teraction with intracellular or extracellular proteins [22].
Further examples of tethered channels are force-sensitive
TRP channels that possess intracellular ankyrin domains.
Ankyrin repeats are proposed to function as “gating
springs” that convey force [23–26]. These tethers have
an estimated stiﬀness of 1 pN/nm and a working range
on the order of 10 nm. Thus, forces are estimated to be
around 10 pN [27, 28]. The pN force scale is also con-
ﬁrmed by experiments [3]. Since the observed gating is
stochastic [26, 29], energy barriers are expected to be
comparable to the thermal energy.

A role of the membrane has been experimentally ver-
iﬁed for tethered TRPA1 channels. Here, gating de-
pends robustly and asymmetrically on membrane curva-
ture that is induced by amphipathic molecules, partition-
ing either in the inner or outer leaﬂet [30]. Furthermore,
GsMTx-4, a toxin that inhibits tension-activated chan-
nels through perturbing the bilayer [31], causes gating of
TRPA1 [30]. In spite of experimental evidence, a theo-
retical analysis of the role of the membrane for tethered
channels is lacking, and this is the focus of this Letter.

In quasi-equilibrium, channel gating is governed by an
energy F , which depends on the internal molecular state

and on the deformation of the membrane around the
channel. Thus, F = Fint + Fm. The internal energy Fint
is determined by structural details, whose characteriza-
tion requires intricate molecular dynamics studies [32].
In contrast, the membrane energy Fm always aﬀects gat-
ing if suﬃcient channel shape changes occur [6]. Focus-
ing on generic principles, we study how force and the
membrane aﬀect two main channel deformation modes,
namely conical deformation and radial expansion.

FIG. 1. Model for a tethered channel embedded in a lipid
bilayer. Variables are deﬁned in the main text. The channel
shape changes either by conical deformation where the angle
α varies or by radial deformation with variation of b.

Calculation of membrane energy.– We consider a ra-
dially symmetric channel that is placed on the centerline
of a cylindrical system with radial coordinate r (Fig. 1).
A constant vertical force F is exerted on the channel,
with signs chosen such that F > 0 is directed upwards.
The channel radius is denoted by b; typically b ≃ 3 nm.
A conical channel shape is characterized by the angle α,
with signs chosen such that α > 0 corresponds to a chan-
nel with small side pointing upwards. The channel is sur-
rounded by a ﬂuid lipid bilayer. The height of the center
of the bilayer above a reference plane is denoted by h(r),
with h(0) being the height at the channel center. The
bilayer thickness is denoted by 2ℓ(r). Hydrophobic prop-
erties of the channel can force the membrane leaﬂets to
splay, leading to a perturbation of the equilibrium leaﬂet
thickness u(r) ≡ ℓ − ℓeq. Typically, ℓeq ≃ 1.75 nm [33].

where the surface integral extends over the entire refer-
ence plane outside the channel. Neglecting shear forces
between the leaﬂets, we assume that the bending mod-
ulus κb is the same for thickness perturbations u and
height perturbations h. Typically, κb ≃ 25 kBT [33].
Changes of membrane thickness are penalized by the
term ∼ κau2, where κa ≃ 40 kBT/nm2 [16, 33]. Ten-
sion γ maintains constant area of both leaﬂets. For eu-
karyotes, tension is usually low, γ ≃ 10−3 kBT/nm2 [35],
and large amounts of excess area are believed to lead
to constant tension [36]. Therefore, in line with previ-
ous research [37], we assume that the force F does not
appreciably aﬀect membrane tension. Elastic membrane
support and the eﬀect on tension are studied in the sup-
plement [34]. A large natural scale for tension can be
ﬁxed by combining the bending modulus and channel ra-
dius as γS ≡ κb/b2; typically γS ≃ 2.7 kBT/nm2 ≫ γ.

The membrane height h(r) is locally determined by a
combined eﬀect of tension and bending, which allows the
introduction of a characteristic lengthscale as

ξ−1 ≡pκb/γ.

(2)

Typical values of the lengthscale are ξ−1 ≃ [5 . . . 500] nm,
which is larger than the channel radius b. A variation of
Eq. (1) yields equilibrium equations determining h(r) as

∇2(∇2 − ξ2)h = 0,

F = 2πbκb∂r(cid:0)∇2h − ξ2h(cid:1) |b,

∂rh|b = α,

(3a)

(3b)

where the boundary conditions involving F and α ﬁx the
height and contact angle at the channel. Far away from
the channel, at r = L ≫ b, we assume h|L = 0.

A variation of Eq. (1) also yields the equation deter-
mining thickness perturbations u(r).
If the membrane
leaﬂets are ﬁxed to the channel walls by chemical inter-
actions, the force F does not change the thickness per-
turbation around the channel. Then we have

Once u and h are calculated, the energy Fm results
from Eq. (1) [34]. Due to its two-dimensional nature,
Fm displays a logarithmic divergence with system size

2

L. However, this divergent energy does not depend on
channel shape parameters, and is thus immaterial for gat-
ing. We remove the divergence and other constants by
deﬁning ˜Fm ≡ Fm + F 2 [Γe + log(ξL/2)]/(4πγ), where
Γe = 0.577 . . . is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Since
usually bξ < 1, the membrane energy can be expanded
up to O((bξ)3) to yield a transparent formula

˜Fm ≈ d2b − γπb2(1 − α2X) + bαF X +

where d2 ≡ πκb(ℓc − ℓeq)2η+η−(η+ + η−) [34]. Further
constants are X ≡ −Γe − log[bξ/2] and Y ≡ (1 + 2X +
2X 2)/4; X and Y are both positive for bξ < 1.

Eq. (5) allows to calculate how membrane energy
changes with channel shape. The ﬁrst term d2b results
from membrane thickness perturbations u around the
channel. This energy is independent of F and penalizes
radial expansion. Note that d2 may change with chan-
nel deformation if the hydrophobic thickness varies. The
second term in Eq. (5) results from membrane tension.
This energy contribution usually decreases with radius b,
except when the channel is very conical α2X > 1. The
two last terms in Eq. (5) contain the eﬀect of the force.
An important role of the conical shape is evident from
the occurrence of α in both terms. In the following, we
use Fm to analyze the energetics of channel deformation.

Conical deformation.– We ﬁrst study a change of the
conical angle α. For an initially closed channel with α =
αc, the angle may change during gating as αc → αc +∆α.
The membrane favors such a channel deformation if the
energy is reduced as Fm(αc + ∆α) − Fm(αc) < 0. Fig. 2a
indicates how Fm changes with ∆α. A force F tilts the
energy function, making conical deformation favorable in
one angular direction and unfavorable in the other. For
physiologically low membrane tension < 10−1γS, Fig. 2a
illustrates that membrane energy varies almost linearly
with ∆α. In this case, Eq. (5) yields

˜Fm(∆α) − ˜Fm(0) ≃ bF X ∆α.

(6)

Using this simple formula with typical values F = 10 pN,
b = 3 nm, ξ−1 = 50 nm, we ﬁnd that an angular defor-
mation of ∆α = 3◦ corresponds to an energy change of
≃ 1 kBT. Hence, minute molecule deformations of even
1 ˚A signiﬁcantly aﬀect the membrane energy in the pres-
ence of a force.

Next, we assume that the molecular channel structure
poses an energetic barrier to conical deformations. With-
out knowledge of details, the resistance to deformation
can be described through an energy scale δα ≡ ∂αFint|αc.
Applying force to a channel causes conical deformations
if the net energy is reduced −|∂αFm|αc + δα ≤ 0. Force
thresholds F ∗ for the occurrence of conical deformation
are thus calculated from the criterion |∂αF |αc = δα.

FIG. 2. a) Change of membrane energy with conical angle ∆α
when the channel is initially cylindrical (αc = 0). Force F > 0
tilts the function to make deformations ∆α < 0 energetically
favorable (dotted lines). b) Lines of threshold forces F ∗(γ, αc)
that allow opening against an internal molecular resistance
δα/b. Note the ampliﬁcation of applied force F ∗b/δα < 1,
which results from membrane leverage. Representative pa-
rameters: b = 3 nm, κb = 25 kBT, δα = 180 kBT/π.

Fig. 2b displays lines for F ∗ that separate parameter re-
gions where conical deformation occurs. Note the scale
on the ordinate F b/δα < 1, which means that a small ap-
plied force F can overcome larger resisting internal force
δα/b and thus cause conical deformation.

To understand this ampliﬁcation of the force F we
use Eq. (6) and estimate |∂αFm|αc ∼ bF X. Equat-
ing membrane deformation energy with internal energy
|∂αFm|αc = δα, the threshold force follows as F ∗ ∼
δα/(bX). Thus, forces result from dividing the internal
energy scale δα by a lever arm length bX ∼ −b log(bξ),
which includes the large scale membrane deformation.
Since X depends only logarithmically on γ and κb,
threshold forces are relatively robust against variation
of these membrane properties.

In Fig. 2b, data for αc 6= 0 illustrates deformation of
a channel that already has a conical shape. For small
tension, γ/γS . 10−2, all curves lie on top each other
since force thresholds F ∗ are not aﬀected by the initial
conical angle αc. On the other hand, strong tension can
deform a channel with αc 6= 0 even when F = 0.

FIG. 3. a) Membrane energy ˜Fm vs. channel radius b. Open-
ing is favored when ∂b ˜Fm < 0. For F = 0, an assumed hy-
drophobic mismatch (ℓc − ℓeq) = 0.2 nm dominates Fm, thus
∂b ˜Fm > 0. ∂b ˜Fm < 0 requires a conical channel with αcF < 0.
b) Lines of threshold forces F ∗∗(γ, αc) at which radial ex-
pansion becomes possible. Full lines: For γ < γo, threshold
forces describe hyperbolic regions where opening occurs when
|αc| > |αmin|. Dashed and dotted lines: When γ ≥ γo, mem-
brane tension is suﬃcient to radially open a channel at αc = 0.
In b) (ℓc − ℓeq) = 0. Representative parameters: κb = 25 kBT,
κa = 40 kBT/nm2, bc = 3 nm, δb = 1 kBT/nm.

Radial deformation.– Channel gating may lead to an
increase of the radius b. However, if ∂b ˜Fm(b) > 0, mem-
brane deformation does not favor this expansion. Fig. 3a
shows the dependence of membrane energy ˜Fm on radius
b for typical parameter values. Clearly, ∂b ˜Fm(b) < 0 only
occurs for a pronounced conical shape. For small angles
αc ≃ 0 or large F , force always favor radial closure of the
channel.

Analogous to the analysis of conical deformations, we
next assume that the channel itself resists radial defor-
mation through an internal force δb ≡ ∂bFint|bc , which
is caused by conformational changes. Threshold forces
for radial opening F ∗∗ are calculated from the condition
∂bFm|bc + δb = 0. Fig. 3b displays thresholds F ∗∗ that
separate regions of parameters (F, αc) where channels are
open or closed. The shape of these regions depends on
tension γ. The critical tension γo ≡ (d2 + δb)/(2πbc),
which opens a cylindrical channel αc = 0 when F = 0,
allows discrimination of two regimes. For γ > γo, we ﬁnd
one central parameter region where the channel is held

open by tension. When γ < γo, two hyperbolic regions
exist where force can lead to radial opening when push-
ing towards the larger side of a conical channel. These
hyperbolic regions are limited by ﬁnite angles |αmin|. To
min ≈ |d2 + δb|bX 2/(κbπ(1 − X)2).
O((bξ)2), we ﬁnd α2
Since α is always limited by geometry, we can use this
formula to estimate maximum internal forces δb that can
be overcome by external forcing. Assuming |αmin| < π/3,
d2 = 0 and typical parameters employed above, we esti-
mate δb . 16 kBT/nm. This maximum force scale is not
large and membrane channels possibly have a less pro-
nounced conical shape. Therefore, radial expansion in
a weak-tension membrane is likely not favored by force,
which is in contrast to conical deformation.

Interaction between channels.– Membrane deforma-
tion can lead to collective eﬀects where force at one chan-
nel aﬀects the gating of neighboring channels. For F = 0,
the interaction between membrane inclusions has been
studied extensively [40–48]. We consider here two chan-
nels with radii b{1,2} and conical angles α{1,2} that are
separated by a distance R in a homogeneous membrane.
A force F is applied to each channel. The membrane en-
ergy ˜Fm can be calculated approximately through a mul-
tipole expansion assuming ξb{1,2} ≪ 1 and R ≫ b{1,2},
which is appropriate for R & 3b1 when b1 = b2 [49]. For
the individual channels, we write the deformation energy
given by Eq. (5) as ˜Fm,1 and ˜Fm,2, where the parameters
b, α are substituted by b{1,2}, α{1,2}. For the interaction
energy ˜Fm,R ≡ ˜Fm − ˜Fm,1 − ˜Fm,2 we ﬁnd [34]

where Xi = −Γe − log(biξ) and contributions of
O(b2
i ξ/R, (biξ)2) as well as terms that do not depend on
αi, bi are neglected. Kn(x) are modiﬁed Bessel functions
of the second kind. Interaction becomes signiﬁcant when
the distance R is smaller than the lengthscale ξ−1.

To study the role of interactions for gating we focus on
the simplest case, namely conical deformation of initially
cylindrical channels (αc = 0 for both channels). Since
both forces have the same sign,
interaction increases
the energy that can be released by conical deformation.
Analogous to the analysis for a single channel,
force
thresholds F ∗
2 for combined conical deformation of two
neighboring channels can be calculated from the condi-
tion −|∂αiFm|0 + δα = 0, i ∈ {1, 2}. Fig. 4 demonstrates
that force thresholds for conical deformation are signiﬁ-
cantly reduced by channel interaction. When R ≪ ξ−1,
the force F ∗ that is necessary to deform a single chan-
nel almost suﬃces to deform two channels. Although
membrane-mediated interactions are not pairwise addi-
tive, two-channel interaction is believed to be dominant
for sparsely distributed proteins [44]. Consequently, we

mation of two channels F ∗
2 is almost as small as for a single
channel F ∗. Lines end at the minimum distance R = (b1 +b2).
b{1,2} = 3 nm, αc = 0, κb = 25 kBT, δα = 180 kBT/π.

expect from Eq. (7) that force-sensitivity of a channel en-
semble can be ampliﬁed by collective mechanics, which
would allow a response to weak, local forces.

Experiments and predictions.– The theoretical frame-
work laid out in this letter is generic since the mem-
brane energy (1) aﬀects gating of any deforming channel.
Whether membrane energy dominates the gating process
must be investigated for speciﬁc channels through exper-
iments or molecular dynamics simulations. For both av-
enues, the theory provides helpful predictions and tools.
The current experimental status allows a few consis-
tency tests. First, molecular structures [50, 51] indicate
that radial deformation of known tethered channels is
small, order 0.1 nm, but transmembrane units tilt during
opening. This ﬁnding is in line with the above analy-
sis, where conical channel deformations under force are
favored by the membrane. Second, the observed acti-
vation of tethered TRP-channels through bilayer pertur-
bations [30] supports a role of the membrane. Quanti-
tative measurements of this type can be analyzed using
Eq. (5) by calculating gating probabilities, which we de-
scribe in [34]. Third, the theory predicts that channel-
channel interaction can lead to a sub-linear dependence of
opening force on the number of tethered channels. This
eﬀect may be measurable at small tensions, e.g., by force
application with an optical trap [3] when the tether den-
sity is varied biochemically [29].

Finally, we emphasize that tension sensing and force
sensing via tethers are not mutually exclusive, but com-
plimentary mechanisms. While tension sensing requires
γ & 1 kBT/nm2, force sensing requires γ . 0.1 kBT/nm2
and becomes rather ineﬀective at large tension. For il-
lustration, we consider TREK-1, an established tension-
sensitive channel [52] that nevertheless associates with
the cytoskeleton [53, 54]. TREK-1 changes its conical an-

gle αc ≃ −0.2 during gating as ∆α ≃ 0.36 while crossing
a molecular energy barrier of [4 − 7.7] kBT [55]. Gating
occurs at tensions in the range of [0.5 − 3] kBT/nm2. Us-
ing Eq. (5), we estimate that a cytoskeletal force of |F | =
10 pN in the presence of gating-tension leads to energy
changes ∼ 2 kBT, which is smaller than the energy bar-
rier. However, for weak tension, γ ∼ 0.01 kBT/nm2, de-
formation under force releases ∼ 7 kBT, which is clearly
comparable to the gating energy barrier. We conclude
that some tethered channels likely play a double role as
force- and membrane-tension sensors.
