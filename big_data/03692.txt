Abstract

We review some properties of black hole structures appearing in gravity
with a massless scalar ﬁeld, with both minimal and nonminimal coupling.
The main properties of the resulting cold black holes are described. The
study of black holes in scalar-gravity systems is extended to k-essence
theories, and some examples are explicitly worked out.
In these cases,
even while the existence of horizons is possible, the metric regularity re-
quirement on the horizon implies either a cold black type structure or a
singular behavior of the scalar ﬁeld.

1 Black holes in general relativity

The existence of black holes is one of the most important predictions of the
General Relativity theory. Even if some aspects of black hole physics can be ob-
tained from the Newtonian theory, the complete concept of black holes includes
the notion of an event horizon and a causal structure typical of the relativis-
tic theory. We are perhaps close to a direct detection of black holes, and the
amount of evidence on black holes is accumulating. The recent detection of
gravitational waves by the LIGO experiment [1] is considered as a clear evi-
dence for the existence of these objects since the measured gravitational wave
carries the signature of the coalescence of two very massive black holes. More-
over, the centers of galaxies may be inhabited by black holes with masses of the
order of millions to billions of solar masses. There are also many indications of
the existence of black holes resulting from stellar evolution, with masses of the
order of a few solar masses.

There are four most well-known black hole solutions in General Relativity:
the uncharged static black hole, given by the Schwarzschild solution; the charged
static black hole, the Reissner-Nordström solution; the uncharged rotating black
hole, the Kerr solution; and the rotating, charged black hole, the Kerr-Newman
solution. The properties of these solutions led to the so-called no-hair conjec-
ture: in general, black holes must be characterised by only three parameters in
Einstein-Maxwell theory, the mass M , the charge Q and the angular momentum
J; however, other parameters corresponding to new charges are added if more
gauge ﬁelds are included into consideration, as happens, e.g., with string theory
inspired Lagrangians; also new parameters like magnetic monopole charges may
appear when general new gauge ﬁelds are taken into account. There is strong
evidence that this conjecture may be violated in some situations, in particular,
when new sources like scalar ﬁelds are considered — see the contributions of
Herdeiro et al. in the present volume.

The prototype of the black hole structure is given by the Schwarzschild

solution, for which the line element reads

ds2 =(cid:18)1 −

2GM

r (cid:19)dt2−(cid:18)1 −

2GM

r (cid:19)−1

dr2 − r2dΩ2.

(1)

Here, the crucial concept of an event horizon appears, through the coordinate
singularity at rH = 2GM . The Reissner-Nordström solution is given by a line
element with two parameters, mass and charge, which reads

ds2 =(cid:18)1 −

2GM

r

+

Q2

r2 (cid:19)dt2−(cid:18)1 −

2GM

r

+

Q2

r2 (cid:19)−1

dr2 − r2dΩ2.

(2)

It brings to scene the notion of a Cauchy horizon, here given by r− = M −
pM 2 − Q2, while the event horizon appears at r+ = M + pM 2 − Q2. The
Reissner-Nordström solution also implies the notion of an extremal black hole,
represented by the conﬁguration where the Cauchy horizon coincides with the

1

event horizon, r+ = r−, so that M = Q. Moreover, if Q > M , the horizons dis-
appear, and the central singularity becomes accessible to an external observer:
this is a naked singularity. These new features appear also, in a diﬀerent form,
in the Kerr and Kerr-Newman solutions.

One of the important results in the study of black hole physics is the dis-
covery of the thermodynamics behavior of those objects. The temperature and
entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole are given by

TH =

1
8π

1
M

,

SH = 4πM 2 =

AH
4

,

(3)

where AH is the area of the event horizon surface. The temperature of the
Reissner-Nordström black hole is given by

TRN =

1

8πM(cid:18)1 − 16π2 Q4
A2(cid:19),

A = 4πR2
+.

(4)

(5)

The temperature of the Reissner-Nordström black hole becomes zero when the
extremal condition is satisﬁed, M = Q. There is no well-deﬁned temperature
for naked singularities. The entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black holes is
still given by the the area law:

S = πr2
+.

(6)

The entropy is always ﬁnite, including the extremal case (see the contribution
by Lemos in the present volume). But, it becomes ill-deﬁned in the naked
singularity case. For a general view of these standard results, see Refs. [2, 3]

This quick review of the standard results in standard black hole physics
settles a basic framework to the main subject of the present text: the fate of
static black hole solutions when the scalar ﬁeld are added to the gravitational
Lagrangian, with minimal or non-minimal coupling. Seminal studies in this
sense have been presented in [4–6]. In some situations, new features appear: in
general, black hole solutions in the presence of a scalar ﬁeld require a violation
of the standard energy conditions, so that the scalar ﬁeld must have a phantom
nature; the event horizon surface has an inﬁnite area; the Hawking temperature
is always zero. Essentially, these results have been obtained in Refs. [7, 8].
We review these results and present some new ones, with a similar structure,
obtained in the context of k-essence models [9].

2 Scalar ﬁelds

The introduction of scalar ﬁelds is the simplest extension of General Relativity.
It adds a spin zero degree of freedom to the theory. We can think on some dif-
ferent possibility to introduce a scalar ﬁeld in a gravitational context. The ﬁrst
one makes use of the minimal coupling between the scalar ﬁeld and gravitation,

2

and it is deﬁned by the Lagrangian

L = √−g(cid:26)R − ǫφ;ρφ;ρ + 2V (φ)(cid:27).

(7)

In this Lagrangian, V (φ) is the self-interaction potential. This kind of theory in
general satisﬁes the energy conditions if ǫ = 1 (an ordinary ﬁeld) and violates
the energy conditions if ǫ = −1 (a phantom ﬁelds).

We may have a much less trivial conﬁguration using a non-minimal coupling,

L = √−g(cid:26)f (φ)R − ω(φ)

φ;ρφ;ρ

φ

+ 2V (φ)(cid:27).

where f (φ) and ω(φ) are, in general, functions of the scalar ﬁeld. The case

f (φ) = φ,

ω(φ) = constant,

V (φ) = 0,

(8)

(9)

deﬁnes the traditional Brans-Dicke theory, the prototype of the scalar-tensor
theories.

Another possibility of including a scalar ﬁeld is a non-canonical kinetic term,

leading to k-essence models,

L = √−g(cid:26)R − ω(φ)f (X) + 2V (φ)(cid:27),

where

X = φ;ρφ;ρ,

(10)

(11)

and f is a given function of X.

Other possibilities are the Horndeski theory [10], with the most general
scalar-tensor Lagrangian leading to second-order diﬀerential equations, and the
Galileon theory [11], where a scalar ﬁeld exhibits some special translational
symmetry. One example of such a generalization is the theory deﬁned by

L = √−g(cid:26)R − Gµν φ;µφ;ν + 2V (φ)(cid:27),

(12)

where Gµν is the Einstein tensor.

3 Black holes in minimally coupled models

without a potential, represented by the equations

there is no black hole solution. Indeed, let us write the four-dimensional spher-
ically symmetric, static metric as

ds2 = e2γdt2 − e2αdu2 − e2βdΩ2,

(15)

where α, β and γ are functions only of the radial coordinate u. The ﬁeld
equations are

− 2β ′′ − 3β ′2 + 2β ′α′ + e2(α−β) =
2γ ′β ′ + β ′2 − e2(α−β) =

For an ordinary scalar ﬁeld, ǫ = 1. Choosing the coordinate condition

α = γ + 2β,

the scalar ﬁeld equation can be easily solved:

The remaining equations simplify to

− 2β ′′ + β ′2 + 2β ′γ ′ + e2(γ+β) =

In the expressions above, m is the ADM mass, C is a scalar charge in the sense
that φ ≈ C/x at large x (but with no universal conservation law in the present
case) and k is their combination according to (30). The metric (28), together
with the deﬁnitions (29,30), corresponds to Fisher’s solution [4]. Clearly, there
is a naked singularity at x = 2k: it is a center.

The situation changes drastically if the null energy condition is violated [7].

The null energy condition requires that

ρ + p ≥ 0.

(31)

In order to violate this condition, the kinetic term must appear with the wrong
sign. If ǫ = −1 (a phantom ﬁeld), we have

ds2 = P adt2 − P −adx2 − P 1−ax2dΩ2,
a2 = 1 +

C2
2k2 > 1.

(32)

(33)

This case represents a black hole with an event horizon at x = 2k with two
remarkable features: an inﬁnite event horizon area and zero surface gravity.

4 Nonminimal coupling

We can write a general action with a non-minimal coupling without a potential
as

L = √−g(cid:26)f (φ)R − ω(φ)

φ;ρφ;ρ
φ (cid:27).

(34)

It is not, however, the most general (the Horndeski theory is the most general
one leading to second-order equations), but it covers a large sample of theories.
Let us ﬁx

Performing a conformal transformation

f (φ) = φ.

gµν = φ−1˜gµν,

with

P (x) = 1 − 2k/x,

(42)

Black holes are only possible when 3 + 2ω < 0, corresponding to the phantom
conﬁguration in the Einstein’s frame.

Are the solutions described above, with a minimal or non-minimal coupling,

black holes? They have some striking features:

1. Their surface gravity is zero. It means that their Hawking temperature (if
it is possible to deﬁne it!) is zero. For this reason, these black holes has
been called cold black holes.

2. The area of the event horizon is inﬁnite. This means an inﬁnite entropy if
we follow the area law. But if the temperature is zero, the entropy cannot
be in principle inﬁnite. Hence, the computation of the entropy in this case
may not follow the classical lines ﬁxed for black holes emerging in General
Relativity.

3. The tidal forces are inﬁnite at the event horizon hypersurface. But point

particles can safely cross this hypersurface.

4. The solutions are asymptotically ﬂat. Hence, static observers at inﬁnity

can be deﬁned.

There is another important feature: The solutions contain a scalar charge, hence
these solutions can be called hairy black holes. This happens even in the Einstein
frame if the energy conditions are violated. This fact points at a limitations
of the so-called no-hair theorem, which seems to be restricted to very speciﬁc
situations.

In fact, the general solution for these scalar black holes reveals two types of
asymptotically ﬂat black hole, besides the trivial (Schwarzschild) one [8]: Type
B1 black holes, where the horizon can be crossed in a ﬁnite proper time by an
infalling particle; Type B2 black hole, where the horizon is reached in a inﬁnite
proper time for an infalling particle. In both cases, there is always a throat on
the way from spatial inﬁnity to the horizon.

5 Stability

The usual GR black hole solutions are stable [2]. These Cold Black Holes, are
they stable? The stability of black holes is a very delicate subject, technically

6

and conceptually. Technically because it is almost impossible to integrate the
perturbed equations even in the simplest case, that of pure radial perturbations;
conceptually because the results may be diﬀerent for diﬀerent perturbation for-
malisms.

Let us consider just radial perturbations:

α = α0(u) + δα(u, t),

β = β0(u) + δβ(u, t),

γ = γ0(u) + δγ(u, t),

(43)

(44)

where α0, β0 and γ0 are the previously found background solutions and δα, δβ
and δγ are (time-dependent!) perturbations around them. In analyzing pertur-
bations around the Schwarzschild solution, for example, it is very convenient to
choose the coordinate condition δβ = 0. However, here the situation is more
delicate since there is a throat in the solutions outside the horizon, the condition
above turns out to be a physical condition: only perturbations that do not aﬀect
the throat are considered.

It is possible, for Cold Black Holes, to choose a coordinate condition similar

to that of the background.

δα = δγ + 2δβ.

(45)

The perturbed equations then may be reduced to a single master equation con-
nected with the perturbation of the scalar ﬁeld:
e4β(u)δ ¨φ − δφ′′ = 0.

(46)

The primes mean derivative with respect to u. This equation can be reduced to

δφ′′ + e4β(u)ω2δφ = 0.

(47)

The condition of stability is ﬁxed as follows: specify the boundary conditions
at the horizon and at inﬁnity; verify if there are solutions connecting these
boundary conditions with ω2 < 0; if there are solutions satisfying the above
conditions at both ends, we conclude that there are divergent growing modes,
and the background static solution is unstable, if not, the background solution
is stable. Following this procedure, we have found the following results [8]:
the cold black hole solutions are stable; solutions with a naked singularity are
unstable.

Let us consider now a scalar ﬁeld and metric perturbations that transform

under the radial reparametrisation ∆u as

δφ → ¯δφ = δφ + φ′∆u,
δr → ¯δr = δr + r′∆u,
where we have deﬁned r(u) = eβ(u). The combination

Ψ = r′δφ − φ′δr,

7

(48)

(49)

(50)

is invariant under that coordinate transformation. The ﬁnal equation is [12]

e2(α−γ)δ ¨φ − δφ′′ − δφ′(γ ′ + 2β ′ − α′) + U δφ = 0,
β ′ Vφ + ǫVφφ(cid:27),

U ≡ e2α(cid:26)ǫ(V − e−2β)

φ′2
β ′2 + 2

φ′

(51)

(52)

where V is a possible potential according to the Lagrangian (7). The singularity
due to the term with β ′ in the denominator prevents a consideration of solutions
ﬁnite at the throat a throat. This singularity may be removed by a further
transformation [13], and a Schrödinger-type equation with a regular potential
is obtained. As a result of this analysis, all previous solutions which contain
throats turn out to be unstable, including those corresponding to black holes
[12]. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Perhaps, in the gauge δα =
2δβ + δγ, we end up with a master equation for a pure gauge mode. Or perhaps
the singularity existing in the potential of the gauge-invariant approach has led
to nonphysical modes.

6 Black holes in k-essence theories

Let us consider the Lagrangian of a k-essence model:

L = √−g(cid:26)R − f (X) − 2V (φ)(cid:27),

where f (X) is a general function of the kinetic term for the scalar ﬁeld,

X = φ;ρφ;ρ.

For the static, spherically symmetric case, the equations of motion are:

− 2β ′′ − 3β ′2 + 2β ′α′ + e2(α−β) = e2α(cid:26) 1

even in the absence of exact solutions. To do so, the coordinate condition is
chosen to be

Regularity at the horizon requires that the components of the energy-momentum
tensor should be ﬁnite, and since they contain fX and φ′, a singularity can only
be avoided if

r → ∞
Hence, a possible black hole must be cold.

Let us consider the particular case where

f (X) = X n.

This solution seems to represent a cold black hole. But it has a very curious
structure. It is a kind of type B2 cold black hole. But, instead of having a ﬂat

asymptotic and a horizon, we have two horizons at ρ = ±1/√Λ, corresponding
to u → ±∞. Beyond each horizon, we ﬁnd a timelike singularity at ρ → ±∞.
In Ref. [9] we also found a solution for the particular case n = 1/3. This
solution reads

where k and B0 are constants. This metric is completely regular at all positive
x, including the horizon located at x = k−1(2B0)1/4. However, the function
f (X) is singular at the horizon, in agreement with the no-go theorem proved
above.

7 Conclusions

Scalar ﬁelds allow for obtaining exact black hole solutions, but only if the energy
conditions are violated, otherwise only naked singularities appear. This state-
ment is valid for both minimal and non-minimal couplings of the scalar ﬁeld
with gravity. (In the only known exception [6, 15] with a conformal scalar ﬁeld,
this ﬁeld is inﬁnite at the event horizon.) A striking feature of these black holes
is that they have zero gravity and an inﬁnite area of the event horizon. Con-
trary to the usual black holes, these cold black holes imply inﬁnite tidal forces
at the horizon. However, this is only true for massless ﬁelds with or without
inclusion of a non-interacting electromagnetic ﬁeld [14]. in full agreement with
the existing no-hair theorems.

The situation changes if one includes other structures, like the string-inspired
dilatonic interaction between scalar and electromagnetic ﬁelds [16–18]: in this
case, a more conventional black-hole horizon can appear, with ﬁnite area and
ﬁnite temperature, in the presence of a usual scalar ﬁeld. However, if the scalar
ﬁeld is phantom, there emerge cold black hole solutions [17, 18]. There are
also black hole solutions, albeit numerical, with "true" scalar hair (i.e. an
independent scalar charge which is conserved) in Einstein’s gravity minimally
coupled to two real (or one complex) massive scalar ﬁelds, and thus obeying all
energy conditions [22].

The stability issue looks somewhat controversial (see above), but most prob-
ably the gauge (44), in which scalar ﬁeld perturbations decouple from the metric
ones, excludes the physical unstable mode found in [12, 13].

k-essence models give origin to similar structures, but with some other exotic
conﬁgurations, to be still better explored. In particular, we ﬁnd, at least for

10

some particular cases, multiple horizons beyond which infalling observers hit
singularities. In such cases the usual notion of a distant observer is inapplicable
since there is no spatial inﬁnity. The features of such solutions, including their
stability, deserve more complete studies.

We here did not touch upon a broader area of possible black holes with
scalar hair in cases where scalar ﬁelds possess nontrivial self-interaction poten-
tials. In such cases, apart from general results like diﬀerent no-hair and other
no-go theorems (see, e.g., [19–22]), there are a large number of exact solutions
of interest, including singular and regular black holes with normal and phan-
tom scalar ﬁelds with and without electromagnetic ﬁelds, see, e.g., [23–26] and
references therein.
