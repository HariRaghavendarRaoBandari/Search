We investigate the interplay between superﬂuidity and spin superﬂuidity in spinor Bose gases
with easy-plane anisotropy. To illustrate that the basic principles governing these two types of
superﬂuidity are the same, we describe the magnetization and particle-density dynamics in a single
hydrodynamic framework.
In this description spin and mass supercurrents are driven by their
respective chemical potential gradients. As an application, we propose an experimentally-accessible
stationary state, where the two types of supercurrents counterﬂow and cancel each other, thus
resulting in no mass transport. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward setup to probe spin
superﬂuidity by measuring the in-plane magnetization angle of the whole cloud of atoms. We verify
the robustness of these ﬁndings by evaluating the four-magnon collision time, and ﬁnd that the
timescale for coherent (superﬂuid) dynamics is separated from that of the slower incoherent dynamics
by one order of magnitude. Comparing the atom and magnon kinetics reveals that while the former
can be hydrodynamic, the latter is typically collisionless under most experimental conditions. This
implies that, while our zero-temperature hydrodynamic equations are a valid description of spin
transport in Bose gases, a hydrodynamic description that treats both mass and spin transport at
ﬁnite temperatures may not be readily feasible.

Introduction.— The phenomenon of superﬂuidity un-
derlies transport properties of numerous systems, includ-
ing various superconductors [1], liquid helium [2], both
bosonic [3] and fermionic [4] ultracold atoms, exciton-
polariton condensates [5], topological insulators [6–8], as
well as neutron stars [9] and ﬂocks of birds [10]. The
possibility to achieve dissipationless propagation of infor-
mation at room temperature has recently fueled interest
in spin superﬂuidity [11, 12] in general and in magnon
spintronics [13–15] in particular.

Ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates of
atomic vapour stand out among these systems as a rare
example where two types of superﬂuidity can be present
simultaneously, and where they are also readily exper-
imentally addressable. Speciﬁcally, experimental ultra-
cold atom techniques currently allow controlled excita-
tion and imaging of both the local phase of the conden-
sate, and also of the spin texture. Exciting mass super-
currents (pertaining to inhomogeneity of the local phase
of the wavefunction) in the system is possible by, e.g.,
stirring the condensate with an “optical spoon” [16]. Sig-
natures of this mass superﬂuidity have been observed in
the collective mode spectrum [17] and lattices of quan-
tized vortices [18]. Furthermore, manipulating and ob-
serving the spin texture (or, equivalently, the spin super-
current [11]) has recently also become possible in this sys-
tem. In particular, spin-agnostic optical traps [19] have
allowed preparation and subsequent imaging of spinor

FIG. 1. By counterﬂowing, a supercurrent and a spin su-
percurrent create a stationary state with no mass ﬂow in a
spinor Bose gas on a ring. In a uniform-density system, the
supercurrent vscalar is due to the global phase texture of the
atomic condensate (indicated by color), whereas the spin su-
percurrent vspin is due to the in-plane magnetization texture
(indicated by arrows which can be recast in terms of a phase
θ) of the magnon condensate with a measure of the condensate
fraction η. The two textures can be independently engineered
in a ferromagnetic spinor Bose gas.

gases, for example, using the Stern-Gerlach method [20]
and also directly [21]. Several methods for imprinting
spin textures have been developed, either relying on vary-
ing external magnetic ﬁelds [22] or optical transitions
[23].

Earlier work [24] has investigated stability of the pla-
nar spin spiral (XY spiral), which is one of the states
that we consider (Fig. 1). Both adiabatic and sudden
preparation was carefully considered, and it was demon-

strated that this state is stable for suﬃciently small spiral
wave vectors. However, despite the recent observation of
a (quasi-)condensate of magnons [25], few studies have
been devoted to spin superﬂuidity in ultracold spinor
gas [26–28], even though this phenomenon has played
a prominent role in liquid helium systems [29]. Further-
more, the interplay of mass and spin superﬂuidity has not
been addressed in the ultracold-atom context to the best
of our knowledge. In this Letter we examine coherent dy-
namics of spinor Bose gases, concentrating on superﬂuid-
ity, spin superﬂuidity, and their interplay. We construct
a hydrodynamic model that incorporates both types of
superﬂuidity on equal footing. In linear response, they
are decoupled. We determine both the collective mode
spectrum and demonstrate that spin superﬂuidity can
be experimentally observed by monitoring the in-plane
magnetization angle of the atoms. Moreover, we demon-
strate that non-linear eﬀects lead to experimentally sta-
tionary states where both supercurrents are counterﬂow-
ing. Finally, we check the robustness of our ﬁndings by
comparing the timescales relevant to these coherent pro-
cesses with the collision timescales describing incoherent
dynamics of this system and show that they are well sep-
arated.

Theoretical framework.— We consider a spinor Bose
gas described by the second-quantized Hamiltonian
ˆH0 =
[30–32]

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆHZ + ˆHI , where

(cid:82) dx ˆψ†µ(cid:0)−2∇2/2M + V (x)(cid:1) ˆψµ represents the kinetic

energy and the trapping potential V (x). The ﬁeld
operators ˆψµ correspond to atoms with mass M in
the hyperﬁne state µ.
(We use the Einstein summa-
tion convention throughout the Letter.) The linear
and quadratic Zeeman eﬀects are described by ˆHZ =

−(cid:82) dx ˆψ†µ(cid:0)p[σz]µν − K[σ2

z ]µν(cid:1) ˆψν, where p (K) is the

energy of the linear (quadratic) Zeeman eﬀect, and σµν
is a vector of spin matrices. The external magnetic
ﬁeld has been chosen to point in the z-direction. The
interactions between particles are described by ˆHI =

(cid:82) dx(cid:0)g0 : ˆρ2 : + g1 : ˆn2 :(cid:1) , where the colons denote nor-

mal ordering, g1 (g0) is the spin-(in)dependent inter-
ˆψµ is the density operator, and
action energy, ˆρ = ˆψ†µ
ˆn = ˆψ†µσµν ˆψν/ˆρ is the local spin operator.

The equations for (cid:104) ˆψµ(cid:105) governing the mean-ﬁeld dy-
namics of this system at zero temperature can be derived
from the Hamiltonian ˆH and written down in terms of a
set of conserved variables. At this point we restrict our-
selves to the ferromagnetic state with the saturated local
magnetization n2 = 1, where the local magnetization is
deﬁned by n = (cid:104) ˆψ†µσµν ˆψν/ˆρ(cid:105), which implies that we do
not consider the nematic [30–32] or antiferromagnetic [33]
evolution. Furthermore, we do not consider the trapping
potential and the quantum pressure term [3]. Moreover,
we omit the linear Zeeman eﬀect, as it can be removed by
going to a rotating coordinate system. In order to write
down these mean-ﬁeld equations in a concise manner, we

deﬁne the usual Eulerian derivative Dt = ∂t+v·∇, where
the velocity v = −i(/2M )(ψ∗µ∇ψµ − [∇ψ∗µ]ψµ)/ρ gov-
erns mass transport but has contributions from both the
global phase of the wavefunction and the spin texture.
In particular, we ﬁnd that magnetization dynamics in a
ferromagnetic spinor Bose gas is described by a Landau-
Lifshitz (LL) equation [34]

Dtn = Jn × ∇2n − Kn × eznz
+J(n × ∇in)(∇iρ)/ρ,

(1)
where ρ = (cid:104)ˆρ(cid:105) is the average density (at zero temper-
ature equal to the atomic condensate density) and the
exchange constant J comes from the kinetic term in ˆH
and describes spin stiﬀness. Neglecting interactions be-
tween spin waves, at low temperature the spin stiﬀness
is [35] J = /2M . The magnetic anisotropy comes from
the quadratic Zeeman eﬀect. It can be generated using a
suﬃciently strong external magnetic ﬁeld, in addition to
radio-frequency and optical means [31]. Three (spin-1)
or more hyperﬁne states are required for the magnetic
anisotropy to be available in an atomic system. When
K < 0, it is favorable for the spin to align with the di-
rector of the magnetic ﬁeld. In this case z is known as
the easy axis. On the other hand, in the so-called easy-
plane situation K > 0, the conﬁguration with n per-
pendicular to the z axis is energetically favored. Both
of these situations can be achieved in a system of ultra-
cold atoms [31]. In addition to the terms already present
in the LL equation, various spin-relaxation terms may
be added, such as the transverse spin diﬀusion [36] and
Gilbert damping [37], as well as terms due to magnetic
ﬁeld inhomogeneities [38] and magnetic dipole-dipole in-
teractions [39]. However, all these terms can be made
small in an ultracold-atom system, hence, we do not con-
sider them here.

Magnon condensate.— Deep in the ferromagnetic
regime where the spin excitations are small deviations
from the average direction of the magnetization, it is nat-
ural to describe the magnetization dynamics in terms of
magnons. Going to this description requires performing
the Holstein-Primakoﬀ transformation [40], which intro-
duces bosonic magnon operators (see Supplemental Ma-
terial for more details). This gas of magnons can have
a thermal component, and also a condensate component.
The condensate of magnons [41, 42] corresponds to the
coherent magnetization precession of the spins in the
whole sample. The symmetry that is broken when the
magnon condensate forms concerns the in-plane magne-
tization angle θ, and the order parameter is related to
the out-of-plane magnetization component nz.

In order to concentrate on the superﬂuidity in this sys-
tem, we do not describe the thermal magnons, and we
also do not investigate the complicated magnon conden-
sation process [25]. Instead, we propose to start from a
sample that is homogeneously magnetized in the z direc-
tion, and then coherently tilt the magnetization (e.g., by

an RF pulse) towards the x − y plane. This populates
the pure-magnon-condensate state directly by preparing
the magnetization of the system in the following conﬁg-
uration:

(2)

n = (η cos θ, η sin θ,(cid:112)1 − η2),

where η = (cid:112)2˜η/(1 + ˜η2) is a measure of the local
magnon-condensate fraction ˜η [43], and θ is the local in-
plane angle. That this magnetization conﬁguration in-
deed corresponds to a magnon condensate is understood
by noting that nx ∼ Re(cid:104)ˆb(cid:105) and ny ∼ Im(cid:104)ˆb(cid:105), where ˆb is the
Holstein-Primakoﬀ operator that annihilates a magnon.
Using Eq. (2) together with the Landau-Lifshitz equa-
tion Eq. (1), and using the mean-ﬁeld equations for the
total density, we obtain a set of hydrodynamic equations,
governing the evolution of the magnon condensate and
the scalar condensate at zero temperature:

Dtρ/ρ = −∇ · v, M Dtv = −∇µ, (3)
Dtnz + vspin · ∇ρ/ρ = −∇ · vspin, Dtθ = −µspin, (4)
where µ = (g0 + g1)ρ + 2(∇nµ)2/4M , and µspin/J =
nz(∇θ)2−(∇2η)/nzη−(∇η)2/n3
z−Knz/J are the chem-
ical potentials. Their gradients drive the mass and spin
supercurrents. These hydrodynamic equations describe
spin and mass superﬂuidity in a single framework, there-
fore constituting the central result of our Letter.

The total velocity can be separated into two parts [30],
that can be addressed separately [16, 22, 23]. First,
we have the conventional superﬂuid velocity vscalar =
(/M )∇φ due to the phase φ texture of the atomic con-
densate wavefunction. However, there also is the spin
superﬂuid velocity vspin = −Jη2∇θ due to the phase θ
texture of the magnon condensate. Thus, the full ve-
locity in this ferromagnetic spinor Bose condensate is
v = vscalar + 2nzvspin/η2. This velocity v inﬂuences
the magnetization dynamics through the advection term
in the Eulerian derivative since the magnetic moments
(individual atoms) are mobile in a cold-atom system,
similarly to e.g. so-called ferromagnetic superconductors
[44]. This is in contrast to most solid-state ferromagnets,
where the magnetic moments are localized.

Collective modes.— In the linear regime, the two su-
perﬂuids are decoupled as the Eulerian derivatives be-
come ordinary derivatives. The elementary excitations
in the homogeneous magnon condensate (η, θ = const.)
have a dispersion

ω2 = KJη2k2 + J 2k4,

(5)

which follows from the equations of motion above. More-
over, the dispersion of the density excitations follow the
Bogoliubov dispersion,

ω2 = (/2M )k2[(/2M )k2 + 2(g0 + g1)ρ/].

(6)

At long wavelengths the dispersion is linear in both cases,

with the speed of sound equal to cspin =(cid:112)KJη2 for the

3

spin excitations and cscalar =(cid:112)(g0 + g1)ρ/m for the den-

sity excitations, signaling that we are dealing with a su-
perﬂuid, as using the Landau argument [45] one can show
that excitations travelling with velocities slower than the
lower of these two speeds of sound are not damped. From
this point on we only consider the critical spin superﬂuid
velocity and drop its subscript: c ≡ cspin. Note that this
homogeneous state is stable and displays spin superﬂu-
idity in the easy-plane situation K > 0 only.

In order to verify that the system is indeed a spin su-
perﬂuid and to show that the conventional superﬂuidity
and the spin superﬂuidity stand on an equal footing, we
propose two experiments which should be realizable with
current experimental techniques. To keep the description
as simple as possible, we work in the one-dimensional
limit, where the spatial conﬁnement is strong in two di-
mensions and more gentle in the remaining spatial di-
mension. Furthermore, in order to avoid complications
due to trap averaging, we consider a box trap [46].

Far-from-equilibrium spin superﬂuidity signature.—
One of the hallmarks of superﬂuidity is an unobstructed
ﬂow of current.
In particular, in a spin superﬂuid, a
spin current can ﬂow with no dissipation as opposed to a
system with diﬀusive spin transport [47], where the spin
current decays after traversing some ﬁnite length, which
depends on the diﬀusion length and on the timescales
of various spin relaxation mechanisms [11]. In this sec-
tion we describe a stationary state (Fig. 1) where the
supercurrent and the spin supercurrent ﬂow in opposite
directions, resulting in no mass transport. However, since
the spin current ﬂows through the whole sample, it thus
illustrates dissipationless spin transport [11].

By considering linear gradients in the atomic conden-
sate phase φ and in the magnon condensate phase θ with
a constant magnon condensate fraction η, from Eqs. (4)
we ﬁnd the stationary-state condition

φ(cid:48) =

nz

2 (cid:18)θ(cid:48) +

K

Jθ(cid:48)(cid:19) ,

(7)

where the primes indicate spatial derivatives. In order to
show that this condition can be satisﬁed for realistic ex-
perimental parameters, we consider a concrete example of
a ring of length L ﬁlled with a cloud of spin-1 atoms (e.g.
the F = 1 hyperﬁne manifold of 87Rb) prepared in the
magnon-condensate state described by Eq. (2). In that
case, a state with nz = 1/2 where the atomic conden-
sate phase winds once (φ(cid:48) = 2π/L), while the magnon
condensate phase has two windings (θ(cid:48) = 2 × 2π/L),
is stationary for KL2/π2J = 16. For a ring of length
L = 12µm, we have Jπ2/L2 (cid:39) 25Hz, which requires a
moderate easy-axis anisotropy of 400Hz. Moreover, this
static state implies no mass transport as vscalar exactly
cancels vspin, and thus v = 0. Note that without easy-
plane anisotropy, and therefore without spin superﬂuid-
ity, such steady states cannot be obtained.

FIG. 2.
Evolution of a sine-shaped magnon conden-
sate packet for realistic experimental parameters: an L =
6µm-long cloud of 87Rb atoms, with the resulting exchange
Jπ2/L2 (cid:39) 100Hz, easy-plane anisotropy of K = 300Hz, and
a peak initial condensate density of η0 = 0.95. The density of
the condensate η (left) is almost unaﬀected by the dynamics,
while the in-plane angle θ (right) evolves almost uniformly
(see text for more details). The in-plane magnetization com-
pletes a full rotation in approximately 60ms. Note that the
total magnetization in the z direction is conserved during the
evolution.

Close-to-equilibrium spin superﬂuidity signature.— It
is also possible to observe a signature of spin superﬂuidity
by measuring the time evolution of the in-plane magneti-
zation angle θ in the simple “bar” geometry (as opposed
to the ring discussed above). To that end, consider a
magnon condensate with a constant atomic condensate
phase φ and a constant in-plane angle θ, in addition to
a smoothly varying magnon condensate fraction bump
η = η0 sin(πx/L) at the initial time t = 0, where L is
the length of the atomic cloud and x is the spatial coor-
dinate. In this case, up to the lowest order in the gradi-
ent expansion, the time evolution preserves the magnon-
condensate-density proﬁle such that ∂tη = 0, while the
in-plane angle rotates in time with no spatial proﬁle de-
veloping,

∂tθ = K(cid:104)nz(cid:105) − Jπ2/(cid:104)nz(cid:105)L2,

(8)

where (cid:104)nz(cid:105) = 2E[η2
0]/π is the z component of magnetiza-
tion averaged over the length of the cloud, and E is the
complete elliptic integral.
A system with a linear dispersion can only be con-
sidered superﬂuid, if its evolution actually probes the
linear part of the dispersion. Since the longest possi-
ble wavelength is equal to the system size, L, we plug
the wavevector k = π/L into the dispersion relation
in Eq. (5) and obtain (π/L)−2ω2 = KJη2 + J 2(π/L)2.
Thus, to see if the linear part of the dispersion is rele-
vant, we have to compute the ratio between two sound
0 = J 2(π/L)2. Fur-
velocities, namely, c2 = KJη2 and c2
thermore, since c2 is position dependent, we have to av-
erage it: (cid:104)c2(cid:105) = KJη2
0/2. It can be concluded that spin
superﬂuidity becomes pronounced when

(cid:104)c2(cid:105)
c2
0

=

KJ(cid:104)η2(cid:105)
J 2(π/L)2 =

Kη2
0

2J(π/L)2 > 1.

(9)

This criterion can be readily evaluated experimentally by
observing the evolution of the in-plane angle. In particu-
lar, the evolution stops (∂tθ = 0) when KL2(cid:104)nz(cid:105)2/Jπ2 =

FIG. 3.
Typical incoherent dynamics timescale evaluated
from the four-magnon interaction term (see the Supplemental
Material for more details).

1. Therefore, prevalence of spin superﬂuidity in the sam-
ple for large condensate fractions (η0 > 0.95) is proven
by measuring that ∂tθ > 0, since E[η2
0] is a monotonically
decreasing function, and since (cid:104)nz(cid:105)2(η0 (cid:39) 0.95) (cid:39) 1/2.
Hence, for a large condensate fraction η observing the
evolution of θ is suﬃcient to distinguish between the sit-
uation where the critical velocity c vanishes, and where
it is substantial. Namely, if ∂tθ < 0, the system is domi-
nated by quadratic excitations and has a negligible criti-
cal velocity, whereas if ∂tθ > 0, the system displays spin
superﬂuidity. In order to illustrate that our conclusion
holds for the full solution for realistic experimental pa-
rameters, we plot the numerical solution in Fig. 2.

Incoherent dynamics.— Up to this point we have only
considered coherent magnetization dynamics. However,
due to nonzero temperatures and interparticle interac-
tions present in real ultracold-atom systems, it is impor-
tant to consider incoherent (kinetic) processes as well.
In particular, it is interesting to study the time scales
for the incoherent (kinetic) magnon dynamics and com-
pare them to the time scales for the coherent evolution.
We compare these two timescales by evaluating the dom-
inant incoherent timescale set by the four-magnon inter-
action [48–50] kinetic integral, which we obtain by using
the Holstein-Primakoﬀ transformation [40] in order to de-
scribe the spin degrees of freedom in this ultracold-atom
system in terms of magnons (see Supplemental Material ).
This timescale can be written in the dimensionless form,

βc
τkΛ

=(cid:18) T
Tc(cid:19)4

I(kΛ),

(10)

where Λ is the thermal magnon de Broglie wavelength,
kBTc (cid:39) 4πJ(ρm/2.6)2/3 is the condensation tempera-
ture of a noninteracting homogeneous magnon gas with
density ρm, β = 1/kBT is the inverse thermal energy,
and I(kΛ) is a dimensionless function, which we evaluate
numerically (see Fig. 3). At low momenta, ﬁtting I yields
a function k2 log k, similar to the one reported previously
in a ﬁeld-theoretical calculation [51, 52].

The result of our kinetic theory is the lower bound on
the relaxation frequency, since we have only included a
single relaxation process. It is likely that due to other

051015200.00.51.01.52.02.53.0processes (e.g. related to magnetic-ﬁeld gradients), the
relaxation is faster. This statement is consistent with
the fact that for a realistic system [53] our result is
1/τ (cid:39) 0.2Hz, i.e., an order of magnitude lower than the
recently reported rate [23]. However, even taking the
experimentally reported rate, we see that the coherent
dynamics discussed previously is an order of magnitude
faster (tens of milliseconds) than the incoherent processes
(hundreds of milliseconds). This implies that, while our
hydrodynamic description is valid at zero temperature,
at ﬁnite temperatures the thermal magnons do not equi-
librate on the time scales set by the coherent dynamics,
which in turn means a hydrodynamic description of the
spin dynamics cannot be readily obtained at ﬁnite tem-
perature.

This stands in contrast to the situation regarding the
scalar degrees of freedom [54] in this system. The diﬀer-
ence is mainly due to the diﬀerent coupling constants, as
the four-magnon coupling constant depends on the den-
sity and momenta of the magnons, whereas for the scalar
degrees of freedom the coupling constant only depends
on the s-wave scattering length a of the atom [55]. A
typical collision time of atoms in the classical approx-
imation [56] is τcl = 1/nσvrel, where n is the density,
σ = 8πa2 is the collision cross section, and vrel is the rel-
ative thermal velocity. For a homogeneous 87Rb gas [57]
with a density corresponding to the condensation tem-
perature of 1µK, at the temperature of 0.1µK, this colli-
sion time is 0.6ms. Therefore, at a nonzero temperature
such a system is in the hydrodynamic regime regarding
the scalar degrees of freedom, which is enforced by rapid
collisions. On the other hand, given the same conditions
the magnon dynamics is in the collisionless regime, al-
lowing for far-from-equilibrium states to persist for long
periods of time. This timescale hierarchy is well deﬁned,
as diﬀerent timescales are separated by at least one or-
der of magnitude. Finally, the above-described situation
concerning magnons in a spinor gas is also diﬀerent from
the binary-mixture situation. There, longitudinal spin
kinetics is comparable to the incoherent dynamics of the
scalar ﬁelds, and hence longitudinal spin currents relax
in milliseconds as well [58, 59].

Summary and future work.— In summary, we
have examined the zero-temperature coherent dynam-
ics of spinor Bose gases. We have described two
experimentally-accessible states illustrating the interplay
between superﬂuidity and spin superﬂuidity. By evalu-
ating a four-magnon collision integral and comparing the
relevant timescales, we have concluded that at nonzero
temperatures the magnon gas is in the collisionless regime
in stark contrast to the situation concerning the scalar
degrees of freedom.

In the future work, we plan to extend our description
by including the experimentally-relevant magnetic-ﬁeld
inhomogeneities into our LL equation, which will allow
us to make a direct connection to the recent experimen-

5

tal results on magnon condensation [25, 38]. Another
interesting direction is to consider nonzero temperature
dynamics of scalar and spin degrees of freedom, which is
particularly intriguing in this system due to a clear hier-
archy of timescales involved. Finally, we point out that
coupling between magnon condensate and thermal cloud
is facilitated by the quadratic Zeeman term [60] which
could make the experimental control over the build-up
of magnon coherence and condensate growth possible.
Moreover, this anisotropy will also aﬀect the magnon ki-
netics.

[53] From Fig. 1 (b) in the paper on coherent magnon op-
tics (Ref. [23]) we read oﬀ that 1/τ (cid:39) 4Hz for k =
2π/(15.4µm). No temperature is given in the paper, but
assuming that T = Tc/10, and taking Tc (cid:39) 1µK from
another paper of the same group (Ref. [38]), we have
kΛ (cid:39) 1/4 and βc (cid:39) 10−5s. These assumptions yield
1/τ (cid:39) 0.2Hz, which is one magnitude lower than the
reported result. Note that it is possible to improve our
accuracy by performing an accurate trap average, distin-
guishing between magnon and gas condensation temper-
atures and populations etc.
