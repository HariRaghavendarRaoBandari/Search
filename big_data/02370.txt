Given a shared EPR pair, two cooperative parties can obtain one bit of shared secret key by
separately measuring the pair along the same basis. Apparently, the Holevo bound [1] suggests that
they cannot obtain more than one secret bit per shared EPR pair. Here we show that they can
do so by independently putting each of their EPR pairs in a Hilbert subspace which is unknown
to the eavesdropper. We also prove the unconditional security of a practical prepare-and-measure
quantum key distribution scheme based on this principle and derive its key rate in the one-way
communication setting.

PACS numbers: 03.67.Dd, 89.70.-a

In a prepare-and-measure-based quantum key distri-
bution (PM-QKD) protocol, the sender Alice prepares a
quantum state and sends it through an insecure chan-
nel to the receiver Bob, who measures the received state
so as to establish a shared raw key. Then, they apply
classical post-processing to the raw key to distill a secure
ﬁnal key [2]. Thanks to the Shor-Preskill proof [2, 3],
one may show the unconditional security of a PM-QKD
by proving the unconditional security of the correspond-
ing entanglement-distillation-based quantum key distri-
bution protocol (ED-QKD). The later protocol is much
harder to implement in practice but is conceptually sim-
pler to handle and understand — Alice and Bob simply
try to share almost perfect EPR pairs through entangle-
ment distillation before generating the ﬁnal secret key by
measuring their share of each EPR pair along the same
basis. Suppose Alice and Bob share a perfect EPR pair
immediately before they generate their shared secret key
in an ED-QKD scheme. Since Alice and Bob separately
see a completely mixed state in the Hilbert space of two
dimensions, the Holevo theorem [1] implies that each of
them could obtain an accessible classical information of
no more than 1 bit after their individual quantum mea-
surements. Thus, they could obtain at most one secret
bit per shared EPR pair. Clearly, this bound is tight
as it is achieved by the entanglement-distillation-based
version [4] of the well-known BB84 quantum key distri-
bution (QKD) scheme [5]. So, it appears that sharing
1 EPR pair cannot generate more than 1 bit of shared
secret information. Here we explicitly show that this is
not true. The trick is to put each shared EPR pair in a
Hilbert subspace, which is not known to the eavesdrop-
per Eve, of a larger Hilbert space similar to a recently
proposed QKD scheme by Chau [6].

Let N ≡ 2n with n ≥ 2 and consider the following

ED-QKD scheme.

1. Alice

secretly

and randomly picks

[a]

∈

She pre-

pares the state P¯i∈GF (2) |¯i + [a]iA ⊗ |¯i + [a]iB/√2,

GF (N )/GF (2) and λ ∈ GF (N )∗.
where all arithmetic in the ket state are perfor-
mance in the ﬁnite ﬁeld GF (N ).
She applies
the linear transformation Lλ|ii 7→ |λii for all
i ∈ GF (N ) to the second qudit before sending it
through an insecure quantum channel to Bob.1

2. Upon reception of the state from Alice, Bob secretly
and randomly picks λ′ ∈ GF (N ) and applies the
linear transformation L−1

λ′ to his received state.

3. Alice and Bob jot down the joint measurement re-

sult along the basis

1

B = {

(−1)

¯i¯c|¯i + [a]iA ⊗ |¯i + [a] + biB

√2 X¯i∈GF (2)
: [a] ∈ GF (N )/GF (2), b ∈ GF (N ),
¯c ∈ GF (2)}

≡ {|Φ[a],b,¯ci}
to their shared quantum state. Then, they publicly
announce the values of λ, λ′ used and keep the state
only if λ = λ′. They repeat steps 1–3 until they
have enough shared pairs.

(1)

4. Alice and Bob pick a random sample from their re-
maining measured states and reveal the values of
b and ¯c obtained for each of the selected states for
various λ’s and [a]’s to estimate the error rate of
the channel. Speciﬁcally, let ˜eb¯c be the probabil-
ity that Alice prepares the state |Φ[a],0,0i and that
the resultant state measured by Alice and Bob is

1 We use the convention that a variable in Roman, square-
bracketed, overbarred and Greek alphabet are in GF (N ),
GF (N )/GF (2), GF (2) and GF (N )∗, respectively.

|Φ[a],b,¯ci for some [a] ∈ GF (N )/GF (2). Then, by
revealing the values of b and ¯c from a random sam-
ple of those shared states to which Alice and Bob
have applied I ⊗ Lλ and I ⊗ L−1
λ , they obtain an
estimate of the value of ˜eλ[b],¯c + ˜eλ([b]+1),¯c for all
[b] ∈ GF (N )/GF (2) and ¯c ∈ GF (2). They pro-
ceed only if the error rate is suﬃciently small. (We
shall discuss the smallness criterion later on in the
unconditional security proof.)

5. Alice and Bob apply one- or two-way entanglement
distillation similar to the ones used in Refs. [3, 6–
8] to the remaining states to distill out almost
perfect EPR-like states each in the form |Φ[a],0,0i.
For instance, they apply a Calderbank-Shor-Steane
(CSS) quantum error-correcting code [9–12] that
could correct the measured spin-ﬂip and phase er-
rors of the channel in step 4.
(Note that such a
CSS code is constructed using a classical N -ary
code C1 and a classical binary code C2 obeying
{0} ⊂ C2 ⊂ C1 via the standard CSS construction.
This is possible for a binary code can be regarded as
an N -ary code by extending the linear coding space
over the ﬁeld GF (2) to the linear space over the
ﬁeld GF (N ). In fact, we may extend the dual code
of the binary code C2 to an N -ary code with the
same minimum distance using the same trick. In
this way, C1 and C2 can be used to correct spin-ﬂip
and phase errors in this noisy and insecure channel,
respectively.)

6. Finally, Alice and Bob separately measure each of
their share of the almost perfect EPR-like states
along the basis B1, where

1

Bλ = {

(−1)

¯i¯c|λ(¯i + [a])i :

√2 X¯i∈GF (2)
[a] ∈ GF (N )/GF (2), ¯c ∈ GF (2)}

(2)

for all λ ∈ GF (N )∗. In this way, they obtain n bits
of shared secret key per EPR-like state measured —
1 bit comes from the phase information ¯c and (n −
1) bits come from the value of [a] ∈ GF (N )/GF (2).

We remark that in the absence of noise and Eve, Alice
and Bob should get b = ¯c = 0 for each pair of tested
quantum particles in step 4. Consider the unitary opera-
tion BADD for Alice and Bob to separately add their ﬁrst
qudit to their second qudit in the computational basis.
Clearly,

BADD(|Φ[a],b,¯ci ⊗ |Φ[a′],b′,¯c′i)
= |Φ[a],b,¯c−¯c′i ⊗ |Φ[a]+[a′],b+b′,¯ci.

(3)

Consider also the unitary operation that acts on the com-

2

if b ∈ GF (N )/GF (2),
otherwise.

(4)

(5)

putational basis according to

H(|bi) =((|bi + |b + 1i)/√2
(−|bi + |b + 1i)/√2

Then

H ⊗ H(|Φ[a],b,¯ci) = (−1)
= (−1)

¯b0|Φ[a],b+¯b0+¯c,¯b0i
¯b0|Φ[a],[b]+¯c,¯b0i

where ¯b0 ∈ GF (2) denotes the constant term of the
degree-(n − 1) polynomial expression for b in GF (2)[x].
Clearly, both H ⊗ H and BADD map basis states in B to
itself up to an overall phase. Since the error-correction
and privacy ampliﬁcation procedure using the specially
designed CSS code in step 5 above involves H ⊗ H,
BADD, standard basis measurement plus local quantum
operation by Bob only, therefore Alice may push her ﬁ-
nal measurement forward in time. By the Shor-Preskill
argument [3, 8], we obtain an equally secure PM-QKD
scheme.

To ﬁnd the corresponding channel error estimation
method for this equally secure PM-QKD scheme, we con-
sider the linear operators [11, 12]

Xu|ii = |i + ui and Zu|ii = (−1)Tr(ui)|ii

(6)

for all u ∈ GF (N ), where Tr(i) = i + i2 + i4 + ··· + iN/2
is the absolute trace of i. Then

L−1
λ

XuZvLλ = Xλ−1uZλv.

(7)

Recall that in our ED-QKD scheme, Alice ﬁrst prepares
the state |Φ[a],0,0i. Consider those shared states to which
Alice and Bob have applied the operations I ⊗ Lλ and
I ⊗ L−1
λ , respectively. Suppose Alice and Bob separately
measure these shared states after passing through the in-
secure channel in the B1 basis. Suppose further that Al-
ice informs Bob her measurement outcomes. Then from
Eqs. (2), (5)–(7), Bob could deduce [λ−1u] + Tr(λv) and
hence both [λ−1u] and Tr(λv) as these two variables are
linearly independent over GF (2). Since the solution of
the equation [λ−1u] = [b] is u = λ[b] or u = λ([b] + 1),
the outcomes of the above measurement by Alice and Bob
give estimates of ˜eλ[b],¯c + ˜eλ([b]+1),¯c for all λ ∈ GF (N )∗,
[b] ∈ GF (N )/GF (2) and ¯c ∈ GF (2). Hence, our ED-
QKD scheme can be reduced to the following equally
secure PM-QKD scheme.

1. Alice randomly picks λ ∈ GF (N )∗ and prepares
one of the basis states in Bλ by randomly selecting
the parameters [a] and ¯c. He sends the state to
Bob.

2. Upon reception, Bob randomly picks λ′ ∈ GF (N )∗
and measures his received state in the Bλ′ basis.

3. They publicly announce the values of λ, λ′ used and
keep their state only if λ = λ′. They add the pa-
rameters ([a], ¯c) describing their prepared and mea-
sured states to their raw key string. They repeat
steps 1–3 until they have a suﬃciently long raw key.

4. They estimate the values of ˜eλ[b],¯c + ˜eλ([b]+1),¯c by
revealing (and discarding) a random sample of dits
from the raw key to which Alice and Bob have ap-
plied I⊗Lλ and I⊗L−1
λ , respectively. They proceed
only if the error rate is suﬃciently small.

5. Alice and Bob apply classical error correction and
privacy ampliﬁcation to their remaining raw keys
based on the classical N -ary code C1 and classical
binary code C2 obeying {0} ⊂ C2 ⊂ C1. Specif-
ically, we denote the (N/2)-ary vector formed by
the [a]’s and the binary vector formed by the ¯c’s in
Alice’s remaining raw key by ~a and ~c, respectively.
Alice announces the error syndromes for C1 of ~a
and C2 of ~c. Bob subtracts them from his corre-
sponding measured error syndromes and then uses
the subtracted results to perform classical error cor-
rections using codes C1 (C2) on his remaining raw
key ~a′ (~c′). For a suﬃciently low noise level, the
Bob’s raw key after error correction should agree
with Alice’s. They now use the cosets ~a + C1 and
~c + C2 as their shared ﬁnal key.

Note that this scheme is analogous to a recent scheme
of Chau in Ref. [6]. The major diﬀerence is that the
two-dimensional Hilbert subspaces used in state prepa-
ration and measurement are not revealed here. And this
is the reason why the entanglement-distillation version of
the present scheme can generate n secret bits per shared
EPR-like pairs. This result does not violate the Holevo
bound [1] because each EPR pair is put in a Hilbert sub-
space that is not known to Bob. Thus, before making his
ﬁnal measurement, Bob sees a 2n-dimensional completely
mixed state for each quantum particle he distilled.

We now discuss the unconditional security of our ED-
QKD scheme. Recall that Eve sees the same completely
mixed density matrix for the quantum state that Alice
sends to Bob in step 1 irrespective of the value of λ used.
i Eve
applies to the insecure quantum channel is independent
of λ, where each Kraus operator used can be written as

So the quantum operation ρ 7→ E(ρ) = Pi KiρK †
Ki = Pu,v∈GF (N ) giuv XuZv for some giuv ∈ C. Since
Pi K †
i Ki = I and Zv Xu = (−1)Tr(uv) XuZv [8, 12], we
havePi,u,v |giuv|2 = 1 andPi,u,v g∗
iuvgi,u,v+w = 0 for all
w 6= 0. Consequently,
˜eb,¯c = hΦ[a],b,¯c|E(|Φ[a],0,0ihΦ[a],0,0|)|Φ[a],b,¯ci

where the primed sum is over those variables v and/or
v′ ∈ GF (N ) satisfying Tr(v) = Tr(v′) = ¯c. Note
that I ⊗ XuZv|Φ[a],b,¯ci = I ⊗ Xu′ Zv′|Φ[a],b,¯ci up to an
irrelevant phase whenever u = u′ and Tr(v) = Tr(v′).
Combined with Eq. (8), we conclude that Eve’s at-
tack through E is equivalent to the quantum operation
ρ 7→ Pu,v euv XuZvρ (XuZv)†. In this regard, we may in-
terpret euv as the probability that the qudit has experi-
enced XuZv in the insecure quantum channel.

Recall that we obtain estimates of ˜eλ[b],¯c + ˜eλ([b]+1),¯c
for [b] ∈ GF (N )/GF (2), λ ∈ GF (N )∗ and ¯c ∈ GF (2)
in step 4 of our ED-QKD scheme.
In the inﬁnite key
length limit, these estimates are exact. From Eq. (8),
by regarding ˜eb,¯c’s as known quantities and euv’s as N 2
unknowns, Alice and Bob’s have (N − 1)2 + 1 linearly
independent equations from their estimates in step 4.
In other words, there are 2(N − 1) degrees of freedom
(The linearly independent equations are
in the euv’s.
the sum rule Pu,v∈GF (N ) euv = 1 plus (N − 1) addi-
tional linearly independent equations from the measure-
ment statistics obtained for each λ ∈ GF (N )∗.) The
dimension of each qudit received by Bob is N = 2n. So
quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound [9, 10] tells us that
the CSS code needed to perform the entanglement distil-
lation in step 5 of our ED-QKD scheme exists provided
that

where the primed sum is over u ∈ GF (N ) and v ∈
GF (N ) obeying Tr(λ−1v) = 0. Moreover, h2({pi}) =
−Pi pi log2 pi and h(p) = −p log2 p − (1 − p) log2(1 − p)
are the two forms of the binary entropy function for clas-
sical probability distributions {pi} and {p, 1− p}, respec-
tively. Note that the ﬁrst line of Eq. (9) comes from
the fact that λ is randomly chosen; and the second h2
in the ﬁrst line involves a sum over those Tr(λ−1v) = 0
because these XλuZλ−1v’s, after conjugation by Lλ, have
the same eﬀect on |Φ[a],0,0i. Note further that we have
used Eq. (7) to arrive at the second line. Once the CSS
code exists, Alice and Bob can almost surely distill out
almost perfect states each in the form |Φ[a],0,0i with a
rate R = max(0, K/{n(N − 1)}). Here, the rate is de-
ﬁned as the number of provably secure bits distilled di-
vided by n times the number of qudit transferred. The
1/(N − 1) factor is the probability that Alice’s λ agrees

∼ 0.16, which is much

that our scheme tolerates e[a] + e¯c <
better than the error-tolerant capability of qubit-based
PM-QKDs [2, 5, 15] using one-way classical communica-
tion although we must stress that direct comparison is
not straightforward due to the presence of the extra pa-
rameter e[a] and the diﬀerent Hilbert space dimension of
the quantum information carrier used. Whereas for the
noiseless case, our key rate is 1/3 which is the same as
that of the six-state scheme [15]. The error-tolerant ca-
pability of our scheme increases as n increases but with
a lower key rate of 1/(N − 1) in the noiseless limit. Bal-
ancing these two eﬀects, we believe that our PM-QKD
scheme is useful in practice when n is set to 2 or 3.

On the experimental side, the state preparation of
this PM-QKD scheme is the same as that by Chau in
Ref. [6]. The measurement is a bit more complicated
than in Ref. [6] for the present scheme requires complete
measurement. It is instructive to investigate the possi-
bility of simplifying the measurement procedure without
compromising security.

We would like to thank Tieqiao Huang and H.-K. Lo

for their discussions.

with Bob’s λ′. That is to say, both our ED-QKD and
PM-QKD schemes can distill out a secure key provided
that Eq. (9) holds for all euv’s given that they obey the
(N − 1)2 + 1 constraints coming from the measurement
statistics in step 4. Clearly, the resultant secret key is
composable [13, 14]. This completes our proof of the
unconditional security.

In principle, we should study the performance of our
QKD scheme using all the (N − 1)2 + 1 parameters con-
straining euv’s. But this approach is not very fruitful.
Since the secret key comes from both [a] and ¯c, it makes
sense to gauge the performance of our QKD scheme by
the key rate as a function of the following two param-
eters, the average bit error rate e¯c of the ¯c’s and the
average dit error rate e[a] of the [a]’s in the raw key.
(Note that both e¯c and e[a] are averaged over λ.) From
Eq. (7) and the fact that h2 is convex, we conclude that
K in Eq. (9) attains its minimum when euv = eλu,λ−1v
for all u, v ∈ GF (N ) and λ ∈ GF (N )∗. Moreover,
Pv euv = e[a]/(N − 1) for all u 6= 0, Pv e0v = 1 − e[a],
and Pλ h2(P′ eλu,λ−1v)/(N − 1) ≤ h2(e¯c). Hence,
K ≥ n − he(e[a]) − h2(e¯c) − e[a] log2(2n − 1).
