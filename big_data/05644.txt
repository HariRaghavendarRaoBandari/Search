ABSTRACT

Observations of debris disks oﬀer a window into the physical and dynamical
properties of planetesimals in extrasolar systems through the size distribution of
dust grains. In particular, the millimeter spectral index of thermal dust emission
encodes information on the grain size distribution. We have made new VLA ob-
servations of a sample of seven nearby debris disks at 9 mm, with 3′′ resolution
and ∼ 5 µJy/beam rms. We combine these with archival ATCA observations of
eight additional debris disks observed at 7 mm, together with up-to-date observa-
tions of all disks at (sub)millimeter wavelengths from the literature to place tight
constraints on the millimeter spectral indices and thus grain size distributions.
The analysis gives a weighted mean for the slope of the power law grain size
distribution, n(a) ∝ a−q, of hqi = 3.36 ± 0.02, with a possible trend of decreasing
q for later spectral type stars. We compare our results to a range of theoretical
models of collisional cascades, from the standard self-similar, steady-state size
distribution (q = 3.5) to solutions that incorporate more realistic physics such
as alternative velocity distributions and material strengths, the possibility of a
cutoﬀ at small dust sizes from radiation pressure, as well as results from detailed
dynamical calculations of speciﬁc disks. Such eﬀects can lead to size distributions
consistent with the data, and plausibly the observed scatter in spectral indices.
For the AU Mic system, the VLA observations show clear evidence of a highly

Introduction

Debris disks represent the end stage of protoplanetary disk evolution. As such, they
provide essential information on the processes of planet formation and circumstellar disk
dispersion (see reviews by Backman & Paresce 1993; Wyatt 2008; Matthews et al. 2014).
The small dust grains detected at optical through centimeter wavelengths are thought to
be produced by the collisional erosion of larger bodies, analogous to comets or Kuiper Belt
Objects, commonly referred to as planetesimals. These kilometer-sized remnants of planet
formation are eﬀectively invisible around other stars, but emission from the dusty debris
produced in ongoing collisions oﬀers a unique window into their physical properties and dy-
namics. In particular, the spectral index of dust emission at millimeter to radio wavelengths
encodes information on the grain size distribution within disks that can be used to constrain
collisional models of planetesimals (Ricci et al. 2012, 2015b).

The dominant mechanism responsible for stirring the planetesimals within debris disks
to incite collisions remains controversial. Stirring could be triggered by the ongoing formation
of Pluto-sized bodies within the disk (Kenyon & Bromley 2002, 2008) or by the dynamical
eﬀects of fully formed planets (Mustill & Wyatt 2009). In either case, the reference model for
dust production is the steady-state collisional cascade ﬁrst formulated by Dohnanyi (1969).
This model assumes that the relative velocities and tensile strengths of the colliding bodies
are independent of size, and leads to a power law size distribution, n(a) ∝ a−q with index
q = 3.5. However, the fragmentation process in debris disks could be more complex. Recent
analytic and numerical studies relax some of the restrictive assumptions of the reference
model, and incorporate more realistic dynamics and material physics.
Including a size-
dependent velocity distribution predicts a steeper distribution, q ∼ 4 (Pan & Schlichting
2012; G´asp´ar et al. 2012), while decreasing the tensile strength of the colliding bodies predicts
a shallower distribution, q ∼ 3 (Pan & Sari 2005).

We present observations of seven debris disks at 9 mm using the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. These long wavelength
observations probe emission from the largest accessible dust grains in the disks. When com-

– 3 –

bined with (sub)millimeter data, these observations provide a long lever arm in wavelength
that mitigates the impact of absolute calibration uncertainties on spectral index determi-
nations. In addition, the spectral slopes at these long wavelengths are relatively insensitive
to the eﬀects of temperature, given typical debris belts at 10’s of K. We combine this sam-
ple with observations of eight additional debris disks with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) at 7 mm. By pairing these long wavelength measurements with previous
observations at shorter (sub)millimeter wavelengths, we can determine the spectral index of
the dust emission and thus the grain size power law index q for the combined sample of ﬁf-
teen debris disks. We compare our results with predictions from existing collisional cascade
models and explore the eﬀects of material strengths, velocity distributions, and small-size
cutoﬀs on the steady-state grain size distribution.

In Section 2 we present the VLA sample of debris disks. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the
VLA observations, analysis, and results. In Section 5, we describe how we determine the
slope of the grain size distribution, q, and we present the results for the combined VLA
and ATCA sample of debris disks. In Section 6, we compare our results to predictions from
collisional cascade models and discuss results from analytical modeling of a steady-state
grain population. In Section 7, we summarize the main conclusions of this study.

2. VLA Sample

We selected a sample of seven debris disks to observe with the VLA at 9 mm to measure
spectral indices and constrain the slope of the grain size distribution, q. The sample was
assembled based on the following criteria: 1) accessible source declinations, δ > −35◦,
2) evidence in the literature for strong millimeter/submillimeter emission (F0.85mm & 8 mJy),
and 3) small enough angular extent to obtain reliable total ﬂux measurements using the most
compact array conﬁgurations. Table 1 lists the source positions and stellar properties, and
a brief discussion of each target follows. All of these disks have been studied extensively
at other wavelengths and have well sampled spectral energy distributions (SEDs) through
the far-infrared. In addition, most of these disks have interferometric data that resolve their
millimeter emission structure, either from the Submillimeter Array (SMA) or the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).

2.1. HD 377

HD 377 is a G2V star at a distance of 39.1 ± 2 pc (van Leeuwen 2007) with an estimated
age of ∼ 150 Myr (Geers et al. 2012). Spectral energy distribution modeling indicates the
presence of dust between 3 and 150 AU (Roccatagliata et al. 2009) and results in a two
temperature component ﬁt with a warmer inner belt at Tdust ≈ 130 K and a colder outer
belt at Tdust ≈ 50 K (Morales et al. 2011; Pani´c et al. 2013). Choquet et al. (2015) recently
detected HD 377 in reprocessed archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) scattered light im-
ages. The disk was resolved at 870 µm with the SMA, revealing a symmetric belt of emission
centered at ∼ 47 AU with a width of ∼ 32 AU (Steele et al. 2016). Greaves et al. (2012) did
not detect the disk at 7.5 − 11.5 mm with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), but the noise
level of 14 µJy/beam gave a 2σ upper limit on the disk ﬂux of < 28 µJy. No gas has been
detected in the system (Geers et al. 2012). Searches with VLT/NACO have not revealed
the presence of any gas giant planets with masses between 3 and 7 MJup and separations of
20 − 50 AU (Apai et al. 2008).

2.2. 49 Ceti

49 Ceti is an A1V star at a distance of 59 ± 1 pc (van Leeuwen 2007) and a member of
the Argus Association, indicating an age of ∼ 40 Myr (Torres et al. 2008). The dust disk was
resolved at 70 µm with Herschel/PACS (Roberge et al. 2013). SED modeling indicates that
this disk has two distinct components, a cold (Tdust = 62 ± 1 K) outer disk extending from 40
to 200 AU and a warmer (Tdust = 175 ± 3 K) inner belt within 40 AU (Wahhaj et al. 2007;
Hughes et al. 2008; Roberge et al. 2013). New ALMA observations at 850 µm are consistent
with this picture and are best-ﬁt by an inner belt of small dust grains between ∼ 4 − 60 AU
and an outer belt of larger grains between ∼ 60 − 300 AU (Hughes et al. in prep).

In addition to the dust disk, 49 Ceti is notable for exhibiting substantial CO emission
(Zuckerman et al. 1995; Dent et al. 2005; Hughes et al. 2008). Resolved (SMA) observations
of CO emission in the 49 Ceti system reveal that the inner disk is devoid of gas, while the outer
belt contains 0.02 ± 0.01 M⊕ of gas (Hughes et al. 2008). Herschel spectroscopy indicates
that this gas cannot be primordial, and may instead be secondary material coming from the
destruction of comet-like ices (Roberge et al. 2013).

2.3. HD 15115

HD 15115 (“the blue needle”) is an F2V star at 45 ± 1 pc (van Leeuwen 2007) whose
space motions suggest membership in the 21 ± 4 Myr-old (Binks & Jeﬀries 2014) β Pictoris
moving group (Mo´or et al. 2011). An infrared excess suggesting orbiting dust was noted in
IRAS observations (Silverstone 2000). Subsequent scattered light imaging from the HST and
other telescopes have resolved an asymmetric, edge-on circumstellar disk (Kalas et al. 2007;
Debes et al. 2008; Rodigas et al. 2012; Mazoyer et al. 2014; Schneider et al. 2014). Observa-
tions of 850 µm emission using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/SCUBA-2 suggested the
presence of a reservoir of large dust grains in the disk, with low temperature (Tdust = 56 ± 9
K). Observations at 1.3 mm with the SMA resolve a belt of emission at ∼ 110 AU with a
width of ∼ 43 AU (MacGregor et al. 2015a). In addition, the millimeter emission shows a
∼ 3σ feature aligned with the asymmetric western extension of the scattered light disk. If
real, this additional feature indicates that the distribution of larger grains in the disk may
be asymmetric as well.

2.4. HD 61005

HD 61005 (“the moth”) is a G8V star at a distance of 35 ± 1 pc (van Leeuwen 2007).
An argument has been made for membership in the Argus Association, suggesting an age of
∼ 40 Myr (Desidera et al. 2011). The presence of dust was originally inferred from a signif-
icant Spitzer infrared excess (Carpenter et al. 2005), and follow-up HST images revealed a
remarkable swept-back disk in scattered light that extends from . 10 to 240 AU (Hines et al.
2007; Maness et al. 2009). The SED is best ﬁt by a belt with Tdust ≈ 80 K at ∼ 90 AU. The
disk was resolved at 1.3 mm with the SMA, and the continuum emission is ﬁt by a narrow
belt (∆R/R = 0.05) at ∼ 70 AU (Ricarte et al. 2013; Steele et al. 2016). There is no indica-
tion that the dramatic scattered light asymmetry persists at millimeter wavelengths. Given
the wavelength-dependent nature of the belt morphology, it is possible that the observed
swept-back features result from interactions with the interstellar medium, which would be
expected to aﬀect only smaller grains (Maness et al. 2009).

2.5. HD 104860

HD 104860 is an F8 zero age main sequence star (∼ 140 Myr) at a distance of 48 ± 2 pc
(van Leeuwen 2007). The SED is well ﬁt by a single temperature component at a radius of 105
AU and Tdust = 33 ± 3 K (Najita & Williams 2005; Roccatagliata et al. 2009; Pawellek et al.

– 6 –

2014). The disk was resolved at 70, 100, and 160 µm with Herschel (Morales et al. 2013),
and these observations are best ﬁt by including a second warm, less massive dust belt at ∼ 5
AU with Tdust ≈ 190 K. SMA observations at 1.3 mm reveal an axisymmetric, broad belt at
∼ 110 AU with a width of ∼ 100 AU (Steele et al. 2016). GBT observations at 7.5−11.5 mm
(Greaves et al. 2012) placed a 2σ upper limit on the disk ﬂux of < 24 µJy. No gas has been
detected in the system (Najita & Williams 2005).

2.6. HD 141569

The HD 141569 system consists of HD 141569A, a young ∼ 5 Myr-old B9.5V star
at 116 ± 8 pc (van Leeuwen 2007), and a pair of low mass comoving companions with
spectral types M2 and M4 located ∼ 7.′′5 away (Weinberger et al. 2000). Despite its young
age, the star is surrounded by a highly evolved late-stage transition or early debris disk.
The morphology of this disk is complex. Scattered light and near-infrared imaging reveal
asymmetric spiral structures between ∼ 175−210 AU and ∼ 300−400 AU (Weinberger et al.
2000; Mouillet et al. 2001; Clampin et al. 2003; Biller et al. 2015). While this outer spiral
structure is truncated at 175 AU, there is an additional inner debris belt between 10 and
50 AU (White et al.
in prep.) with a dust temperature of Tdust ≈ 80 K determined from
SED modeling (Nilsson et al. 2010).

In addition to dust, this system contains between 20 and 460 M⊕ of gas (Zuckerman et al.
1995; Thi et al. 2014). Most of this gas is associated with the outer part of the disk and
distributed non-uniformly in two ring-like structures at ∼ 90 and 250 AU (Dent et al. 2005).
However, near-infrared observations indicate that there is additional CO gas distributed be-
tween 10 and 50 AU, commensurate with the inner debris system (Brittain & Rettig 2002;
Goto et al. 2006). Recent SMA and CARMA observations at 870 µm and 2.8 mm, respec-
tively, resolve the gas disk (Flaherty et al., submitted) and reveal a large inner hole in the
CO gas distribution interior to ∼ 29 AU and an outer edge at ∼ 224 AU, interior to the
previously imaged scattered light rings. Additionally, these observations yield Tgas ∼ 27 K,
lower than the dust temperature.

2.7. AU Mic

AU Mic is a nearby (9.91±0.10 pc; van Leeuwen 2007) M1V star in the β Pictoris moving
group, suggesting an age of 21 ± 4 Myr (Binks & Jeﬀries 2014). The star is surrounded by
a nearly edge-on circumstellar disk extending to a radius of at least 210 AU, discovered in

– 7 –

coronographic images of scattered starlight (Kalas et al. 2004). ALMA Cycle 0 observations
at 1.3 mm revealed (1) an outer belt with an emission proﬁle that rises with radius out to
40 AU and (2) a newly recognized central peak that remained unresolved (MacGregor et al.
2013). The outer dust belt shows no evidence of asymmetries and is characterized by a dust
temperature of Tdust ≈ 25 K. The central peak is ∼ 6 times brighter than the expected stellar
photosphere, indicating an additional emission process in the inner region of the system,
either a warm (Tdust ≈ 75 K) planetesimal belt or a hot stellar chromosphere or corona
(Cranmer et al. 2013; Sch¨uppler et al. 2015). AU Mic is also well known to be a rich source
of stellar ﬂaring activity, notably at X-ray (Mitra-Kraev et al. 2005; Schneider & Schmitt
2010) and ultraviolet (Robinson et al. 2001) wavelengths.

3. VLA Observations

VLA observations for six of the seven sources in the sample were carried out between
June and August 2014 at a wavelength of 9 mm (Ka band). Two 120-minute scheduling
blocks (SBs) were observed in the D conﬁguration (baseline lengths 0.04 to 1.03 km) for all
disks except HD 141569, where only one SB was executed. HD 61005 was observed in the
DnC conﬁguration (with north-south baselines to 2.11 km, for its southern declination). We
observed AU Mic, the seventh source, in June and July 2013 with two 105-minute SBs in
the D conﬁguration and one 105-minute SB in the C conﬁguration (baseline lengths 0.05 to
3.38 km). Table 2 summarizes the essentials of these observations, including the observa-
tion dates, array conﬁgurations, number of antennas, baseline lengths, weather conditions,
on-source time, and the gain calibrators used. Overall, the weather conditions were very
good for these summer observations (rms of < 6◦ measured with the Atmospheric Phase
Interferometer at 11.7 GHz). The total bandwidth available for all observations was 8 GHz,
split into 4 × 2 GHz basebands centered at 30, 32, 34, and 36 GHz. The characteristic rms
for these observations was ∼ 5 µJy/beam and the typical natural weight beam FWHM was
∼ 3′′.

The data from each track were calibrated separately using the CASA software pack-
age. The passband shape was calibrated using available bright sources, mainly J0319+4130,
J0609-1542, J1256-0547, and J1924-2914. Observations of 3C48 and 3C286 during each track
were used to derive the absolute ﬂux scale, with an estimated accuracy of < 10%. Imaging
and deconvolution were performed with the clean task in CASA (version 4.3.1).

4. Results of the VLA Observations

Figure 1 shows the VLA 9 mm images for the six detected debris disks in the sample.
HD 377 was undetected. For the detected disks, the peak signal-to-noise ratio achieved
ranges between ∼ 4σ (HD 15115 and HD 104860) and ∼ 16σ (HD 141569).

Fig. 1.— Images of the 9 mm continuum emission from the six debris disks detected in the
VLA sample. Contour levels are in steps of [2, 3, 4, 6] × rms for all images, except HD 141569
(lower center) where contours are in steps of 3 × rms (characteristic rms ∼ 5 µJy). The white
contours in the AU Mic image (lower right) mark the subtracted stellar component in steps of
[10, 20, 40, 80, 160] × rms. The ellipse in each lower left corner indicates the synthesized beam size.
The star symbol marks the position of the stellar photosphere. The dashed gray line indicates the
position angle of the disk determined from previous optical, near-infrared, or millimeter imaging
and listed in Table 1.

The 49 Ceti and HD 141569 disks are unresolved by these observations. The HD 15115,
HD 61005, and HD 104860 disks are all marginally resolved, appearing extended in the direc-
tion of their position angles as determined from previous optical, near-infrared, and millime-
ter imaging. Indeed, the HD 15115 disk shows a hint (at a ∼ 2σ level) of the same asymmetric
western extension seen in previous optical and millimeter imaging (MacGregor et al. 2015a).
For all ﬁve of these disks, the total ﬂux density was determined by integrating the surface
brightness over the area showing continuum emission at & 2σ above the background rms in
the image. The total uncertainty on the 9 mm ﬂux density was taken to be the rms noise

– 9 –

measured for the image added in quadrature with the 10% uncertainty in the absolute ﬂux
calibration. For HD 377, we obtain a 3σ upper limit on the total disk ﬂux density. Table 3
lists the synthesized beam size and position angle, the measured 9 mm ﬂux density, and the
rms for all of the sources in the sample.

AU Mic is the only disk that is well resolved in the sample. The C conﬁguration
aﬀords high angular resolution (beam size < 1′′, corresponding to < 10 AU at the distance
of AU Mic) relative to the extent of the disk. This high resolution allows us to separate
emission from the the central star and the disk. The star is very active at radio wavelengths,
ﬂaring on timescales shorter than the scheduling blocks. We were able to isolate the disk
emission by subtracting a time-dependent point source model from the data to account for
the stellar emission. In doing this, we could not avoid subtracting out some disk emission
co-located with the star. We estimated the total ﬂux density as for the other disks in the
sample. However, the result obtained should be considered a lower limit to the disk emission.
A detailed account of the stellar emission observed in the AU Mic system is included in the
appendix.

5. Determining the Slope of the Grain Size Distribution q

We adopt the method of Ricci et al. (2012, 2015b) who used ATCA observations at
7 mm to constrain the millimeter grain size distribution of six debris disks. Since the
thermal dust emission from debris disks is optically thin, the ﬂux density is given by
Fν ∝ Bν(Tdust)κνMdust/d2, where Bν(Tdust) is the Planck function at the dust tempera-
ture Tdust, κν ∝ νβ is the dust opacity, expressed as a power law at long wavelengths, Mdust
is the total dust mass in the disk, and d is the distance. Draine (2006) derived a relation
between β, the dust opacity power law index, and q, the grain size distribution parameter:
β = (q − 3)βs, where, βs is the dust opacity spectral index of small (i.e. much smaller
than the observing wavelength) particles. For size distributions that follow a power law
with 3 < q < 4 from blow-out grain sizes (on the order of ∼ µm) to larger planetesimals
(∼ 1 − 100 km), βs = 1.8 ± 0.2, consistent with observations of both diﬀuse and dense
interstellar clouds. It should be noted, that given the restrictive assumption of 3 < q < 4,
this relation could prove inaccurate for any disks that have a size distribution index outside
of this range. Additionally, for dust compositions with large fractions of amorphous carbons
or ices, values of βs can drop to ∼ 1.4 (e.g.
‘cel800’ produced by the pyrolysis of cellulose
at 800◦ C in Draine 2006), resulting in higher q values for a given β. For a representative
case, where β = 0.5, q = 3.28 and 3.36 for βs = 1.8 and 1.4, respectively. The change in q
due to a change in βs is ∼ 0.08 in this case, comparable to the uncertainties on q derived by

– 10 –

our analysis. Since we do not expect this eﬀect to be large, and given our limited knowledge
of the grain compositions in the debris disks in our sample, we assume βs = 1.8 for the
purposes of our analysis. This relation between β and q has been found to be very accurate
for diﬀerent dust models considered in the literature to interpret the millimeter wavelength
emission of young circumstellar disks (see e.g. D’Alessio et al. 2001; Ricci et al. 2010b,a).

For debris disks around solar-type and earlier stars, the dust is typically warm enough
(kBTdust >> hν) for the Planck function at long wavelengths to reduce to the Rayleigh-Jeans
approximation Bν(Tdust) ∝ ν2. A more accurate expression can be obtained by approximat-
ing the Planck function as a power law Bν(Tdust) ∝ ναPl, where αPl = αPl(Tdust) . 2 (and
= 2 in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit). Given two frequencies, the spectral index αPl of the Planck
function between ν1 and ν2 can be expressed as

αPl = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

log(Bν1/Bν2)

log(ν1/ν2) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(1)

Substituting the Taylor expansion of Bν to second order yields the following approximation
for the spectral index:

αPl ≈ 2 +

log(cid:16) 2kB Tdust−hν1
2kB Tdust−hν2(cid:17)

log(ν1/ν2)

(2)

For our purposes, the spectral index of the Planck function can be approximated by the
Rayleigh-Jeans solution with a correction that depends on the dust temperature Tdust and
observing frequencies used to determine the millimeter spectral index.

Observationally, the ﬂux density of debris disks at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths
can be described by a simple power law Fν ∝ ναmm, where αmm = |log(Fν1/Fν2)/log(ν1/ν2)|.

Combining these relationships provides a simple expression for the slope of the grain

size distribution, q as a function of αmm, αPl, and βs:

q =

αmm − αPl

βs

+ 3

(3)

Thus, by measuring the millimeter spectral index, αmm, and by inferring αPl from the dust
temperature for each disk, we can determine the slope of the grain size distribution, q.

5.1. Estimated q Values for the Complete Sample

We complement the VLA 9 mm observations of the seven debris disks with ATCA
7 mm observations of eight additional debris disks (system characteristics listed in Table 1)
analyzed in previous papers. Results for Fomalhaut were presented by Ricci et al. (2012), and
results for q1 Eri, β Pic, HD 95086, HD 107146, and HD 181327 were presented by Ricci et al.
(2015b). For HD 181327 and HD 95086, we have recalculated spectral indices given newly
available ALMA measurements. For q1 Eri, we have recalculated the spectral index using the
ﬂux measurement at 870 µm from APEX (Liseau et al. 2008), to be closer to the Rayleigh-
Jeans regime for a more accurate determination of the spectral slope. Su et al. (2015) suggest
that previous ﬂux measurements of HD 95086 are likely contaminated by emission from the
extragalactic background. Any such background galaxies are included within the ATCA
beam and not resolved from the disk. Given this situation, which may well apply to other
sources, we simply use the total ﬂux density within the beam in the analysis. The ǫ Eridani
debris disk, which was not detected at 7 mm with ATCA (MacGregor et al. 2015b), provides
an upper limit on the spectral index in combination with resolved observations at 1.3 mm
from the SMA. We have also included archival ATCA observations of AK Sco, a ∼ 18
Myr-old binary system with a massive (∼ 5 − 10MJup) circumbinary disk of gas and dust
(Czekala et al. 2015). Given its age, there is some debate as to whether this system is a
long-lived disk of primordial origin or a second-generation debris disk. We choose to include
it in the sample to examine the eﬀects gas might have on collisional cascade properties (see
Section 5.2). We used the uvfit routine in Miriad to ﬁt a point source model to the ATCA
7 mm AK Sco visibilities and obtained a total ﬂux density of F7mm = 430.0 ± 18.2 µJy.
Figure 2 shows images of the 7 mm continuum emission from the debris disks detected by
ATCA (excluding Fomalhaut).

Table 4 lists a previously reported ﬂux density of each disk in the sample at a given
(sub)millimeter wavelength, and we use these values combined with the VLA 9 mm and
ATCA 7 mm ﬂuxes to determine a millimeter spectral index, αmm. Eight of the disks in the
sample have ﬂux measurements from ALMA data available. For the remaining seven disks,
we used ﬂux measurements from the SMA, JCMT/SCUBA, and APEX as available. The
reported uncertainties for these (sub)millimeter ﬂux measurements include a 10% uncertainty
in the absolute ﬂux density calibration added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainties.
Table 4 also presents the dust temperature (Tdust), the spectral index of the Planck function
(αPl), and the slope of the grain size distribution (q) derived using Equation 3. For all of the
disks, the dust temperature was inferred by assuming radiative equilibrium with the central
star: Tdust = (L∗/16πσR2

L∗ and resolved (sub)millimeter imaging to estimate a characteristic radius for the dust,
Rdust. The uncertainties on Rdust and Tdust are conservatively estimated to be 20% and 10%,

respectively. Given Tdust and the two frequencies used to measure αmm, we determined αPl
for each disk using the relationship derived in Equation 2. The ﬁnal uncertainty on q results
from propagating the errors on αmm, αPl, and βS.

For the complete sample, q values range from 2.84 (HD 141569) to 3.64 (HD 104860).
The weighted mean of these q values is hqi = 3.36 ± 0.02. This result is consistent with
previous work by Ricci et al. (2015), which presented results for ﬁve of the debris disks
included in this larger sample and obtained a weighted mean of hqi = 3.42 ± 0.03.

5.2. Trends in q with Stellar and Disk Properties

With this larger sample, we can not only determine a weighted mean value of q, but begin
to look for trends with stellar and system characteristics. The stars in the sample span a
wide range of ages (5−4800 Myr) and spectral types (A−M). Table 1 lists the characteristics

– 13 –

of the stars in the full sample, including age, spectral type, luminosity, distance, and whether
or not gas has been detected in the disk.

We ﬁrst consider trends with stellar properties, namely age and spectral type. There
does not seem to be any correlation between system age and grain size distribution. For
disks with estimated ages < 100 Myr (49 Ceti, HD 15115, HD 61005, HD 141569, AU Mic, β
Pic, HD 95086, Ak Sco, and HD 181327), the weighted mean is hqi = 3.36 ± 0.02. Disks with
estimated ages > 100 Myr (HD 377, HD 104860, q1 Eri, ǫ Eri, HD 107146, and Fomalhaut)
have a weighted mean of hqi = 3.35 ± 0.02, consistent with the other subsample within
the uncertainties. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test gives a 85% probability that these two
subsamples are drawn from the same distribution. However, we notice a tentative trend with
spectral type. If we arbitrarily choose to separate the sample into two groups by spectral
type, then the weighted mean is hqi = 3.40 ± 0.02 for stars with spectral types A−F (49
Ceti, HD 15115, HD 61005, HD104860, HD 141569, q1 Eri, β Pic, HD 95086, AK Sco, and
HD 181327) and hqi = 3.30 ± 0.03 for spectral types G−M (HD 377, HD 61005, AU Mic,
ǫ Eridani, and HD 107146). Given the uncertainties, these two subsamples diﬀer in q by
∼ 3σ. The clear outlier in the sample is HD 141569, with a q value of 2.84 ± 0.03 (discussed
in Section 6.4).
If we exclude this source from the sample, the weighted mean for A−F
stars is hqi = 3.45 ± 0.02, diﬀerent from the other subsample by ∼ 5σ. A Spearman’s rank
correlation measure of statistical dependence between two variables indicates that this trend
is signiﬁcant at 96% conﬁdence. A K-S test gives a probability of only 15% that these two
subsamples are drawn from the same distribution. Given the small number statistics (there
are noticeably fewer late type stars in the sample), we cannot draw any ﬁrm conclusions.
However, this is suggestive that stars with later spectral types may exhibit shallower grain
size distributions. Interestingly, Pawellek et al. (2014) also note a trend of increasing q values
for more luminous stars, determined from mid- to far-infrared observations probing smaller
grain sizes.

It is also plausible that characteristics of the disks themselves, regardless of stellar
properties, might aﬀect the grain size distribution. Four of the disks in the sample have
robust detections of gas: 49 Ceti, HD 141569, β Pic, and AK Sco. For these disks with gas,
hqi = 3.33 ± 0.03 including HD 141569, and hqi = 3.42 ± 0.03 omitting HD 141569, neither
value diﬀering from the mean of the full sample by > 3σ. The K-S probability for these
two subsamples is 92%. However, since there are only four disks with detections of gas in
the sample, observations of more debris disks are needed to address the eﬀect of disk gas on
grain size distribution.

6. Discussion

We have performed interferometric observations of a sample of seven debris disks at
9 mm with the VLA and supplemented them with observations of eight debris disks observed
with ATCA at 7 mm. By combining these long wavelength ﬂux densities with previous
(sub)millimeter measurements, we have determined a millimeter spectral index and inferred
the slope of the grain size distribution, q. The weighted mean of the q values in the complete
sample is hqi = 3.36 ± 0.02.

We now compare these new results for the full sample to theoretical models of colli-
sional cascades. In particular, we consider the eﬀects of incorporating alternative velocity
distributions (Section 6.1), material strengths (Section 6.2), and radiation pressure blowout
(Section 6.3) on the resulting grain size distributions in debris disks.

6.1. Comparison to Collisional Models

The reference model for dust production in debris disks is the steady state catastrophic
collisional cascade. In this model, smaller ‘bullets’ shatter larger ‘targets’ through collisions.
Assuming conservation of mass, this shattering recipe leads to a power law size distribu-
tion of colliding bodies with radius a within the disk, n(a) ∝ a−q. A detailed description
of the analytic treatment of collisional cascades can be found in Pan & Sari (2005) and
Pan & Schlichting (2012).

The benchmark model of collisional cascades is presented by Dohnanyi (1969). Using
laboratory experiments, Dohnanyi formulated a model of collisions in the Asteroid Belt,
where bodies dominated by material strength have an isotropic velocity dispersion and col-
lisions occur between bodies of roughly the same size. Given these assumptions, Dohnanyi
obtains the classic result of q = 7/2 in steady-state.

If the assumption that the bodies participating in the collisional cascade have a single
velocity dispersion regardless of size is relaxed, then steeper grain size distributions can be
produced. Pan & Schlichting (2012) extend the Dohnanyi (1969) formulation of collisional
cascades by accounting for viscous stirring, dynamical friction, and collisional damping in
addition to the mass conservation requirement already discussed. For collisions between
equal-sized, strength-dominated bodies, accounting for a size-dependent velocity distribution
where velocity decreases with decreasing particle size yields 3.64 ≤ q ≤ 4.
If, instead,
the velocity increases with decreasing particle size, then shallower size distributions are
produced. This scenario makes sense for particles close to the blowout size, where radiation
pressure strongly aﬀects the particles’ velocities. Given a population of grains with velocity

– 15 –

function v ∝ ap and material strength parameterized by Q∗
D ∝ aγ, Pan & Schlichting (2012)
give a simple formulation for q as a function of γ and p: q = 21+γ−2p
6+γ−2p . For small grains
(a . 1 mm) strongly aﬀected by radiation pressure, the collision velocities are expected to
be proportional to the radiation-pressure induced eccentricities and p ≈ −1. For strength-
dominated particles, 0 ≥ γ > − 1/2. Given a representative value of γ = −0.3, this
formulation yields q = 2.95. For the somewhat larger (sub)millimeter particles probed by
our observations, it is plausible to expect q values somewhere between this estimation and
Dohnanyi’s q = 3.5.

G´asp´ar et al. (2012) explored the evolution of collisional cascades in debris disks using
numerical models. They varied a total of 21 variables in their models describing the geometry
of the system, the strength of the colliding bodies, and the outcome of collisions. In steady-
state, these calculations yield a range of q ≈ 3.64 − 4.33.

A number of other numerical models incorporate more realistic physics in order to model
the grain size distributions for speciﬁc systems. L¨ohne et al. (2012) use the ACE (Analysis of
Collisional Evolution, see e.g. Krivov et al. 2013) code, which takes into account grain mate-
rial strength, mutual gravity, and the relative orientation of the orbits of colliding particles,
to model the size distribution for HD 207129. Sch¨uppler et al. (2014) and Sch¨uppler et al.
(2015) use the same numerical code to model the size distributions of HIP 17439 and AU
Mic, respectively. For grain sizes between 10 µm and 1 mm, these models yield q values
between 3.3 and 3.4 for all three systems. Additionally, Th´ebault & Wu (2008) suggest
that the grain size distribution should depend on the degree of dynamical excitation of the
dust-producing planetesimals. In disks with parent bodies in low-eccentricity, low-inclination
orbits, the resulting size distribution should be ﬂatter than classical collisional cascade mod-
els. Pawellek & Krivov (2015) use the ACE code to examine this prediction and obtain
q ∼ 3 for grains of size a = abl
2e , where abl is the blowout size and e is the mean eccentricity
of parent bodies. For larger grains, 100 < a < 1000 µm, the slope is closer to ∼ 3.3 − 3.4.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of q values from the ﬁfteen debris disks in the sam-
ple along with the steady-state model predictions of Dohnanyi (1969), Pan & Sari (2005),
Sch¨uppler et al. (2015), G´asp´ar et al. (2012), and Pan & Schlichting (2012). The weighted
mean of the sample, hqi = 3.36 ± 0.02, is comparable to the classic Dohnanyi (1969) solu-
tion of q = 3.5, but still diﬀers formally by ∼ 7σ. Models of speciﬁc debris disk systems
using the ACE numerical code (e.g. L¨ohne et al. 2012; Sch¨uppler et al. 2014, 2015) yield q
values between ∼ 3.3 − 3.4, lower than classical collisional cascade models and comparable
to the weighted mean of our sample. G´asp´ar et al. (2012) obtain some q values from their
models that are comparable to the observed mean value, but only by increasing the scaling
of the strength regime, S, to >> 108 erg/g, in excess of the ﬁducial value of 3.5 × 107 erg/g

respectively. Stars have been ordered by luminosity from top to bottom (see Table 1 for speciﬁc
luminosity values). The solid lines and dashed regions indicate diﬀerent model predictions: (red)

result, (purple) numerical results of G´asp´ar et al. (2012), and (blue) incorporating a size-dependent
velocity distribution (Pan & Schlichting 2012).

(Benz & Asphaug 1999). All of the models from Pan & Schlichting (2012) that incorporate
a size-dependent velocity distribution where velocity decreases with decreasing particle size
yield q values greatly in excess of the observed q values for all of the individual disks in
our sample. However, the velocities in the grain size range of interest could instead increase
with decreasing particle size due to radiation pressure. As is shown above, such a velocity
distribution could reproduce q values comparable to our results.

We can also explore the eﬀect of additional parameters on the grain size distribution,
namely the strength of the colliding bodies and deviations from a strict power law introduced
by a small-size cutoﬀ due to radiation pressure. This is done in the following two sections.

– 17 –

6.2. Varying the Strength of Colliding Bodies

Models of collisions between rubble pile grains can predict q values comparable to our re-
sults. However, it is unclear if these parameters are realistic for the colliding grains probed by
our millimeter observations of debris disks. The idea of collisions between strengthless rubble
piles was proposed to explain observations of comets and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), which
are on the order of several kilometers in size (Asphaug & Benz 1996; Jewitt & Sheppard
2002). Our observations probe millimeter to centimeter sized grains, which are typically as-
sumed to be rocky and strength dominated. Analytical and numerical calculations indicate
that bodies do not become gravity-dominated until they are larger than ∼ 1 km (Wyatt et al.
2011). Furthermore, laboratory experiments show that the strength of small rocky particles
does not vary signiﬁcantly with particle size, scaling as a−0.4 (Housen & Holsapple 1999).
However, one could imagine that millimeter and centimeter sized grains might be more sim-
ilar to loose conglomerates than rocky pebbles, and thus might exhibit strength scaling laws
more similar to large rubble piles. In fact, measurements of the optical polarization of the
AU Mic debris disk taken with HST/ACS suggest that the grains in the disk are highly
porous (91 − 94%), more like ‘bird nests’ (Graham et al. 2007).

To produce the models discussed in Section 6.1, we require that the bodies participating
in the collisional cascade are strength-dominated. If the colliding bodies are more like ‘rubble
piles,’ held together by gravity instead of material strength, we can replace the destruction
criterion that collisions occur between bodies of the same size with the requirement that the
kinetic energy of the bullet be equal to the gravitational energy of the target. Pan & Sari
(2005) derive a range of q values 3.0 ≤ q ≤ 3.26 for such a collisional population, lower than
the steady-state collisional cascade predictions of Dohnanyi (1969).

6.3. Wavy Distributions Produced by a Small-Size Cutoﬀ

Grains within a debris disk are continually subject to radiation pressure from the central
star. Large grains are less aﬀected by this radiation pressure and remain in bound orbits,
while smaller grains are placed in hyperbolic orbits. A ‘blowout’ size, abl, can be deﬁned
as the grain size for which the force due to radiation pressure (Frad) is half the force from
gravity (Fg) and Frad/Fg & 0.5. For grains smaller than this blowout size, bound orbits are
impossible and grains are removed from the disk.

Dohnanyi (1969) did not include a small-size cutoﬀ in his theoretical framework to
account for the removal of grains smaller than the blowout size.
Including such a cutoﬀ
superimposes waves or ripples on the predicted power law distribution. The lack of grains

– 18 –

smaller than abl, causes the equilibrium number of blowout-sized grains to be enhanced. In
turn, this results in an enhanced destruction rate of grains with sizes typically destroyed
by blowout-sized grains. Consequentially, the absence of these grains produces a higher
equilibrium number of grains that would have been destroyed by them. This ripple eﬀect
propagates upwards through the grain size distribution. Previous numerical simulations
have produced and discussed this wavy pattern (Campo Bagatin et al. 1994; Th´ebault et al.
2003; Krivov et al. 2006; Wyatt et al. 2011). The wavelength and amplitude of these waves
depends strongly on the collisional velocities and properties of the colliding bodies.

A realistic debris disk, however, is not expected to have a sharp cutoﬀ at small grain
sizes. Krivov et al. (2006) note that dispersion in densities and fragmentation energies within
an inhomogeneous grain population will likely weaken or smear any waves produced in the
size distribution. Additionally, including erosive or cratering collisions has a clear impact on
the grain size distributions (Th´ebault & Augereau 2007; Kenyon & Bromley 2016), washing
out ripples at grain sizes much above the blowout size.

Within the analysis of this paper, we have assumed that the size distribution of par-
ticles within a debris disk is a power law, n(a) ∝ a−q. Given the wavy size distributions
predicted by some numerical models, however, it is plausible that the power law size dis-
tribution we measure between millimeter and centimeter wavelengths does not reﬂect the
full distribution from micron to kilometer sizes.
In order to explore the eﬀect of ripples
on the measured grain size distribution further, we have replicated with small modiﬁca-
tions the numerical model presented by Wyatt et al. (2011) and implemented analytically
by Kenyon & Bromley (2016). The details of the model are described in Section 6.3.1 and the
results and implications are presented in Section 6.3.2. This simple model provides a useful
illustration of how possible modulations in the grain size distribution would be reﬂected in
the observed opacity spectrum. However, the results should not be over interpreted, given
the range of eﬀects that may damp such modulations in more realistic systems.

6.3.1. A Steady State Model with a Small-Size Cutoﬀ

We deﬁne a population of planetesimals divided into N bins spaced logarithmically in
size, where the mass and size of the kth bin are mk and ak, respectively. The largest bin is
deﬁned to be k = 1 and size decreases with increasing k such that ak+1/ak = 1 − δ, with
δ = 0.01. The size of the smallest bin is deﬁned as the blowout size, abl, and the size of
the largest bin is ﬁxed at 104 m. Like Wyatt et al. (2011), we assume a steady state where
the mass loss rate per logarithmic bin is constant and the mass in each bin is deﬁned as
mk = C/Rc
k is the collision rate in bin k. The

k, where C is some arbitrary constant and Rc

rel)1/3 and Q∗

D/v2

Using this formalism, the mass in each bin can be solved for analytically, beginning with
the smallest bin, k = N. Since there are no smaller impactors available, only bodies of size
aN are involved in the collisional cascade. Thus, Rc

K can be solved for simply:

Rc

N = (cid:18)6PN N

ρπaN (cid:19) × mN = AN mN

(5)

The mass in bin N is then pC/AN . Next, we can consider bin N − 1. In this bin, the

summation in Equation 4 has two terms:

Rc

k = Ak+1mk+1 + Akmk

(6)

Since we already determined the mass in bin N, we know the ﬁrst term Ak+1mk+1 = Bk.
We can then simplify Equation 6 to Rc
k = Bk + mkAk. The mass in bin N − 1 is then found
by solving a quadratic equation:

m2

kAk + mkBk − C = 0

(7)

Moving up to bins of larger size, Rc
k always contains two terms, a sum over all collisions
with smaller particles and mkAk for the current bin. Thus, the mass in each bin is found
simply by solving Equation 7 for every bin. In this formulation, the shape of the steady-state
distribution is independent of the total mass.

Once we have determined the steady-state number of grains in each bin, we calculate
grain opacities to determine whether the resulting wavy number distribution translates to an
observable eﬀect. We assume the same grain compositions as Ricci et al. (2010b) that contain
7% silicates, 21% carbon, and 42% water ice by volume, and have 30% porosity. The details

– 20 –

of these assumptions are not important to demonstrate the resulting eﬀect on the opacities.
For each size bin, we use the Mie scattering code implemented by Dullemond & Dominik
(2004) for use in RADMC, a code for dust continuum radiative transfer. The output of this
code is an opacity spectrum for each individual grain size in our model. To determine the
ensemble opacity at each wavelength, we then calculate a mass-weighted average over all
grain sizes given the steady-state size distribution.

The ﬁnal result of this procedure is the ensemble opacity of a given population of grains
as a function of wavelength. For our observations, we measure ﬂux density at two wavelengths
in order to determine the millimeter spectral index, αmm. If the dust opacity is a simple
power law, νβ, we can infer β = αmm −2 from our observations so long as the disk emission is
optically thin and in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. Given the ﬁnal ensemble opacity spectrum
from our models, we can determine the power law index, β, between any two wavelengths
we might observe at. By computing β for a range of models and wavelengths corresponding
to the observations presented in this study, we can examine the scatter in β (and thus q) we
might expect due to waves produced by a small-size cutoﬀ in the grain size distribution.

6.3.2. Variations in Spectral Indices Due to Waves in Grain Size Distributions

To determine the expected scatter in the observed millimeter-centimeter spectral index
from waves superimposed on the power law grain size distribution, we considered three free
D. For debris disks, vrel & 1 km s−1 (Krivov 2007);
parameters in our model: abl, vrel, and Q∗
we calculated models for a range of 1 to 6 km s−1. We considered both constant Q∗
D = Qs
D = Qsrβs. For rocky objects dominated by
and a power law dependence on grain size, Q∗
material strength, Qs = 6 × 103 J kg−1 and βs = −0.40 (Benz & Asphaug 1999). The
blowout size, abl is expected to vary between ∼ 1 − 10 µm for the disks in the sample.

Figure 4 shows the resulting size distribution (left panel) and ensemble opacity as a
function of wavelength (right panel) for two example models with blowout size, abl, of 1 µm
and 10 µm. For both models, we ﬁxed vrel = 5 km s−1 and Q∗
D = 6 × 103 J kg−1. The waves
produced in the size distribution by the changing blowout size are seen as muted features in
the dust opacity curves. For these two models, blowout sizes of 1 and 10 µm produce dust
opacity power law indices of β = 0.63 and 0.88, respectively. For lower relative velocities
(vrel ∼ 1 km s−1) the waves are damped at long millimeter and centimeter wavelengths and
the change in β is negligible. For the full range of free parameters we explored, the resulting
values of β ranged from 0.5 to 1.1, comparable to the spread in our complete sample of debris
disks, −0.20 . β . 1.15. This is not a deﬁnitive explanation for the trend we see in spectral
index as a function of stellar type, but it suggests that the waves produced by introducing a

lisional cascade with a blowout size abl of 1 µm (blue solid line) and 10 µm (red dashed line).
For both models, we have divided the analytic number distribution, n(a), by the expectation for
a power law distribution, n(a)pl ∝ a−3.5, to show the waves introduced by the small-size cutoﬀ
more clearly. The expected power law size distribution, n(a)pl, is indicated by the dotted black

blowout size (red dashed line). Again, the dotted black line indicates the expected ensemble opacity
for the power law size distribution with no waves. The gray lines indicate the wavelengths of our
(sub)millimeter and VLA observations used to determine the millimeter spectral index, αmm.

cutoﬀ at small grain sizes could introduce observable scatter in the values of β, and thus q,
similar to that seen in the measured spectral indices. It is also possible that grain porosity
could change with particle size and create damped resonances as a function of wavelength
that might produce structure in the opacity spectrum and result in low values of β. Recent
work suggests that K−M (and possibly G) stars do not exhibit a blowout limit for plausible
dust compositions (e.g. Reidemeister et al. 2011; Vitense et al. 2012; Sch¨uppler et al. 2015).
The lack of a sharp size cutoﬀ for such stars could further damp any waves in the grain
size distribution, possibly contributing to the inferred shallower size distribution for these
late-type stars.

6.4. Stellar Emission Components

A potential source of bias is our implicit assumption that all of the emission we detect
If the measured ﬂux densities at long

at long wavelengths comes from the dusty debris.

– 22 –

wavelengths include emission from any additional mechanisms, then we will underestimate
the true millimeter spectral index and thus the size distribution power law index, q. As
discussed in the appendix, the AU Mic system exhibits signiﬁcant emission from stellar ac-
tivity at both 1.3 and 9 mm that can be explained by models of a hot stellar corona or
chromosphere. Given this stellar activity, the presence of an asteroid belt (MacGregor et al.
2013; Sch¨uppler et al. 2015) is no longer needed to explain the previously reported compact
millimeter emission. In this system, we were able to distinguish the excess stellar emission
from the disk and subtract it using a time-dependent model. Only three other systems
are well enough resolved by the centimeter observations to address this issue, β Pic, ǫ Eri-
dani, and Fomalhaut. Indeed, while the ǫ Eridani debris disk is not detected at centimeter
wavelengths, the central star exhibits excess emission attributable to a hot chromosphere
(MacGregor et al. 2015b). The Fomalhaut system shows a central peak at 7 mm distinct
from the cold, outer debris belt whose origin is unclear (Ricci et al. 2012). In the eleven
unresolved systems in the sample, we cannot separate disk dust emission from any stellar
contamination, if present.

The clear outlier in the sample is HD 141569, with a q value of 2.84 ± 0.03, well-
below the weighted mean of our complete sample and the classic Dohnanyi prediction. In
order to increase this q-value to 3.50, as predicted by Dohnanyi (1969), more than 90%
of the emission measured at 9 mm would have to come from contamination from a stellar
component, vastly in excess of the expected photospheric ﬂux at these long wavelengths.
However, a contribution from an active stellar chromosphere or corona cannot be ruled out.
While this system has been imaged with ALMA at 870 µm, it remains unresolved (White et
al. in prep), so we have no constraints on the millimeter or centimeter stellar emission. The
HD 141569 disk is the youngest source in the sample with an age of ∼ 5 Myr and contains
a signiﬁcant amount of gas. Furthermore, HD 141569 has two nearby M dwarf companions
(Weinberger et al. 2000) with their own associated radio emission (see Figure 1). It is possible
that one or all of these system characteristics contributes to the low q value measured, or
that the central region of the disk is optically thick at these wavelengths. For example, gas
drag and other transport mechanisms (Poynting-Robertson or stellar wind drag) would tend
to ﬂatten the size distribution of aﬀected grains. Wyatt et al. (2011) show that the resulting
q value is αr − 1, where αr is the slope of the redistribution function or the mass distribution
of fragments produced in collisions. Given αr = 4, the expected q value for a system with
gas drag would be ∼ 3, much ﬂatter than the classic Dohnanyi prediction of q = 3.5 and
more comparable to the result for HD 141569.

In order to conclusively determine if the ﬂux measurement of HD 141569 or any of the
other unresolved disks in the sample are contaminated by coronal or chromospheric emission,
observations at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths with higher angular resolution are

– 23 –

needed. A growing number of nearby solar type stars, including α Cen A and B (Liseau et al.
2015) and ǫ Eridani (MacGregor et al. 2015b), have all been seen to exhibit excess emission
at long wavelengths attributable to a hot chromosphere. However, except for AU Mic, none of
the other debris disks in our sample that have been resolved with ALMA show any evidence
for an additional strong stellar emission component.

7. Conclusions

We present new VLA observations at 9 mm of a sample of seven debris disks. Using the
best available ﬂux measurements at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, we place tight constraints
on the millimeter/centimeter spectral indices. We combine these with archival ATCA ob-
servations at 7 mm of an additional eight debris disks building on the work of Ricci et al.
(2015a) and Ricci et al. (2012) to infer the dust grain size distribution power law index, q.

1. For the full sample, the weighted mean for the slope of the power law grain distri-
bution is hqi = 3.36 ± 0.02, with a range of 2.84 to 3.64. This result is closest
to the prediction of q = 3.50 in the classical model of a collisional cascade pre-
sented by Dohnanyi (1969) and to recent numerical results by L¨ohne et al. (2012),
Sch¨uppler et al. (2014), and Sch¨uppler et al. (2015) for speciﬁc debris disk systems.

tributions where velocity decreases with decreasing particle size produce signiﬁcantly
steeper size distributions. Numerical models by G´asp´ar et al. (2012) yield some q val-
ues consistent with these results, but only by increasing the scaling of the strength
curve in excess of ﬁducial values. Shallower size distributions can be produced by
models that allow for a velocity distribution where velocity increases with decreas-
ing particle size or models that consider colliding bodies not dominated by material
strength.

2. Although limited by small number statistics, the observations suggest a trend in q as
a function of stellar type. The weighted mean for stars with spectral types A−F is
3.45 ± 0.02 and 3.30 ± 0.03 for spectral types G−M. We see no evidence for trends in
q as a function of system age or gas abundance in the disk.

3. Introducing a cutoﬀ in the grain size distribution at small sizes due to radiation pressure
can superimpose waves on the power law grain distribution. We examine a range of
analytic models varying the blowout size (abl), the relative collision velocity (vrel), and
the collision energy (Q∗
D). Changing the blowout size from 1 µm (typical for K and
M stars) to 10 µm (for A and B stars) produces measurable waves in the grain size

distribution and the resulting dust opacity. For a reasonable range of parameter values,
the waves produced vary the inferred dust opacity power law index β between 0.5 and
1.1, a spread in values comparable to the scatter in the observations. In realistic debris
disk systems, however, inhomogeneities in densities and fragmentation energies likely
weaken or smear these modulations.

4. The VLA observations of the AU Mic system show signiﬁcant and variable emission
from stellar activity at centimeter wavelengths on timescales from minutes to months.
Given this new evidence, the asteroid belt posited by MacGregor et al. (2013) is not
needed to explain any aspects of the observed millimeter emission. High angular reso-
lution at centimeter wavelengths allows us to distinguish this stellar emission from the
dust disk emission. However, the vast majority of debris disks in the sample have not
been resolved at centimeter wavelengths. Given this, we are unable to separate disk
dust emission from any stellar contamination (or extragalactic background contamina-
tion), if present, for these systems. Higher resolution observations at millimeter and
centimeter wavelengths are needed to place better constraints on the contribution of
stellar activity to the total ﬂux measurements.

These VLA and ATCA observations provide the longest wavelength ﬂux measurements
of these ﬁfteen debris disk systems to date. But, observations at centimeter wavelengths of
new systems are needed to continue to grow the sample and place better constraints on any
trends in the grain size distribution with stellar or disk properties.

A. Radio Light Curves of AU Mic

AU Mic is an active M dwarf star that is known to exhibit radio-wave bursts. In quies-
cence, previous observations placed upper limits on the ﬂux at radio wavelengths, < 120 µJy
at 3.6 cm (White et al. 1994; Leto et al. 2000). Recent ALMA observations of the system
at 1.3 mm revealed a compact central emission peak with a ﬂux of ∼ 320 µJy in addition
to the continuum dust emission from the debris belt and greatly in excess of the expected
photospheric ﬂux at this long wavelength. Cranmer et al. (2013) model this excess emis-
sion as arising from a hot stellar corona. Sch¨uppler et al. (2015) suggest that chromospheric
emission from the star could also contribute at millimeter and radio wavelengths.

These new VLA observations of AU Mic oﬀer a unique glimpse at the variations in radio
emission from the star on minute to month-long timescales. Observations were taken at 9 mm
(Ka band) in the DnC conﬁguration on May 9 and 11, 2013 and in the C conﬁguration on
June 21, 2013. Each of the three scheduling blocks (SBs) was a total of 105 minutes in
length. Observations of AU Mic were interleaved with the gain calibrator, J2101-2933, in a
4 minute cycle, with 3 minutes on-source.

Fig. 5.— Stellar light curves for AU Mic showing the variation in ﬂux density over the course of
our three observations. The ﬂux density was determined for each 3 minute integration using the
CASA task uvmodelfit to ﬁt a point source model to the visibilities.

Figure 5 shows the stellar light curves for each of the three SBs. To determine the ﬂux
density, we used the CASA task uvmodelfit to ﬁt a point source model to the visibilities
from each 3 minute on-source integration. There is strong radio emission from the star
present in all 3 SBs with a ﬂux of 0.5 − 1.5 mJy. During the third SB, the star appears to
have ﬂared strongly, increasing in brightness by 100 − 150%.

Cranmer et al. (2013) simulated the time-steady coronal emission of AU Mic in both
X-ray and millimeter bands, but they did not account for time variability. In order to begin

– 31 –

to estimate the relative enhancements in the coronal emission during ﬂare times, we re-ran
the Cranmer et al. (2013) model for a range of imposed variations in the coronal heating. We
assumed that a fractional ﬁlling factor, f , of the coronal volume was occupied by ﬂare-like
plasma, and that the photospheric driving velocity, v⊥, of MHD turbulence was enhanced
by a dimensionless factor, ξ, in that region. Thus, for a range of input parameters (f ≤ 1,
ξ ≥ 1) we simulated both the total X-ray luminosity, LX, and the thermal free-free emission,
Iν, at the observed VLA wavelength of 9 mm. The goal was to ﬁnd a combination of
plausible f and ξ values that would produce a relative enhancement in LX of order 30% to
60% (to match the ﬂare amplitudes reported by Smith et al. 2005; Mitra-Kraev et al. 2005;
Schneider & Schmitt 2010) simultaneously with an increase in the 9 mm continuum of order
100 − 150% (see Figure 5).

To match the observed ranges of ﬂux density enhancement, we found that the ﬁlling
factor f must be larger than 0.48, and the boundary velocity enhancement factor ξ must
be within the range of 4.1 − 8.2. These values of ξ correspond to an increase in the total
nonthermal energy input of order 20 − 70 in the ﬂare regions. The maximum enhanced
temperature in this subset of models was found to be about 13 MK. This is reminiscent
of the hottest of the three temperature components (3.37, 7.78, and 17.3 MK) inferred
from Chandra spectra of AU Mic by Schneider & Schmitt (2010). The quiescent model of
Cranmer et al. (2013) successfully predicted temperatures between the two lower Chandra
values, but the largest value appeared to be explainable only by ﬂare activity.

A better understanding of cool-star ﬂare activity will depend on broader observational
coverage in both time and wavelength. Kepler has opened up new vistas of study of how
properties of white-light “superﬂares” on active stars may relate to the more familiar case
of the Sun (Maehara et al. 2015). However, recent multi-wavelength surveys of M and K
dwarf exoplanet host stars (e.g., France et al. 2015) are also revealing new information about
weak ﬂares that do not manifest at visible wavelengths. For the better-resolved case of
the Sun, recent observations and simulations show that nearly all coronal heating activity
may take the form of a distribution of ﬂare events with a range of strengths and timescales
(Fletcher et al. 2015). Even models that invoke MHD waves and turbulence appear to require
the spontaneous production of nanoﬂare-like magnetic reconnection events as a ﬁnal product
of the cascade from large to small eddies (e.g., Osman et al. 2011; Velli et al. 2015).
