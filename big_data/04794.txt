The concept of symmetry breaking has been a propelling force in understanding phases of matter.
While rotational symmetry breaking is one of the most prevalent examples, the rich landscape of
orientational orders breaking the rotational symmetries of isotropic space, i.e. O(3), to a three-
dimensional point group remain largely unexplored, apart from simple examples such as ferromag-
netic or uniaxial nematic ordering. Here we provide an explicit construction, utilizing a recently
introduced gauge theoretical framework, to address the three-dimensional point-group-symmetric
orientational orders on a general footing. This uniﬁed approach allows us to enlist order parame-
ter tensors for all three dimensional point groups. By construction, these tensor order parameters
are the minimal set of simplest tensors allowed by the symmetries that uniquely characterize the
orientational order. We explicitly give these for the point groups {Cn, Dn, T, O, I} ⊂ SO(3) and
{Cnv, Sn, Cnh, Dnh, Dnd, Th, Td, Oh, Ih} ⊂ O(3) for n = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6,∞}. This central result may be
perceived as a roadmap for identifying exotic orientational orders that may become more and more
in reach in view of rapid experimental progress in e.g. nano-colloidal systems and novel magnets.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Rotational symmetry breaking of the three dimen-
sional (3D) orthogonal group O(3) plays an important
role in many condensed matters systems, from classical
and quantum spins to molecular and strongly correlated
electronic nematic liquids [1–5]. In familiar instances, like
the Heisenberg ferromagnet and the uniaxial nematic, the
full rotational group O(3) is broken to O(2) and D∞h,
respectively. However these are in fact only two special
cases of the rich landscape of O(3) symmetry breaking.
Indeed, as a matter of principle, matter can break the
rotational symmetries of isotropic space O(3) to any of
its subgroups, leading to long range orientational order
characterized by complicated tensors order parameters.
The subgroups of O(3) have been mathematically iden-
tiﬁed for a long time and entail the well-known three-
dimensional point groups. In Fig. 1, we show a represen-
tative selection of these symmetry groups and moreover
their characterizing symmetry hierarchy.

Perhaps surprisingly, it appears that the zoo of point-
group orientational orders has never been explored in
full generality. Needless to say, the classiﬁcation of rota-
tional order parameters for some non-broken symmetries
has been gradually accumulating since the past century
due to various motives. Firstly, in the soft matter lit-
erature the unixial (D∞h) and biaxial (D2h) order pa-
rameter have been shown to be characterized by second-
rank tensors [2], which have been intensively studied in
various theories [6–13]. In addition, higher rank order-
ing tensors for the Td-tetrahedral [14–17], Oh-cubic [18–
20] and Ih-icosahedral [14, 19, 21–24] orders have been

discussed by many authors e.g.
in the context of Lan-
dau theories and nematic lattice models. Nonetheless,
these cover still only a small subset of all 3D point group
symmetries and, to the best of our knowledge, the order
parameters for most instances are not known explicitly
nor have appeared within a single uniﬁed classiﬁcation
scheme. These general order parameters, however, are
becoming of more practical interest. New exotic orienta-
tional orders may be realized in ensembles of anisotropic
constituents, especially nano- and colloidal particles of
diﬀerent shapes [25, 26].
In particular, the increasing
experimental ability to control such degrees of freedom
[27–30] is especially promising in this regard. Secondly,
many unconventional orientational orders have also been
proposed for quantum magnets [31–33] and spinor con-
densates [34, 35]. In all these cases, the order parame-
ters associated with each symmetry are indispensable to
eventually verify the symmetry of these phases and the
associated physics.

In this paper we bridge this divide and set out to clas-
sify the order parameters associated with arbitrary point
groups within a single systematic framework.
In par-
ticular, we adopt a gauge theoretical formulation, which
we recently proposed in the study of generalized liquid
crystals [36]. We derive the full table of order param-
eters for physically most relevant 3D point groups.
In
detail, we highlight the order parameters for physically
interesting symmetries including all the crystallographic
point groups, the icosahedral groups arising in the con-
text of quasi-crystalline ordering, and the ﬁve inﬁnite ax-

ial groups {C∞

(cid:39) SO(2), C∞v (cid:39) O(2), C∞h, D∞, D∞h}

exhibiting a continuous rotational SO(2)-axis. We show
that in order to uniquely characterize a point-group-
symmetric orientational order of a phase, at most two
order parameter tensors and a pseudoscalar are needed:
the second ordering tensor is required by the ﬁnite ax-

tensors

Let us begin by recalling the characterization of rota-
tional ordering in the familiar context of the Heisenberg
ferromagnet and the conventional uniaxial nematic. In
the ferromagnetic phase of a classical Heisenberg mag-
net, the rotational O(3) symmetry of the Hamiltonian

breaks down to the point group C∞v (cid:39) O(2) deﬁned
by the axis of magnetization M. The order parameter
M = (cid:104)ni(cid:105) is given by the macroscopic averaging of local
spins ni and is a 3D vector with an orientational order
parameter space O(3)/O(2) (cid:39) S2. On the other hand, for
uniaxial liquid crystals or spin nematics, where the O(3)
symmetry is broken to the point group D∞h in the or-
dered phase, the system exhibits a macroscopic ordering
along an axis n. The uniaxial symmetry D∞h acts on the
order parameter as n → −n and these describe the same
macroscopic ordering. Often depicted as being formed
of explicitly rod-like “molecules”, a coarse-grained order
parameter can be formulated in terms of a local vector ni
along the “long” axis of each “molecule”, with the iden-
tiﬁcation of ni with −ni. To deﬁne the uniaxial orien-
tational order, one therefore needs a second rank tensor,
Q[n] = n⊗ n− 1
3 which is characterized by its invariance
under n → −n and is zero in the isotropic phase by be-
ing traceless. Accordingly, the global order parameter is
deﬁned as Q[n] = (cid:104)Q[ni](cid:105) in the coarse-grained order pa-
rameter theory and formally relates to the unixial order
parameter space O(3)/D∞h (cid:39) S2/Z2 (cid:39) RP2, the real

projective plane.

The above familiar examples share the key feature of
having an O(2) symmetry in the plane perpendicular to
the ordering vector, which is why the underlying physics
is so apparent: the order parameter is deﬁned by one axis
and the rotations in the perpendicular plane are trivial,
and the degrees of freedom eﬀectively reduce to 1D ob-
jects (the spins and the rods in the above examples).
Nonetheless, for general 3D point-group-symmetric or-
dering, the order parameter and the coarse grained de-
grees of freedom form intrinsic 3D objects. To deﬁne the
3D orientation one therefore has to depart from a full
O(3) rotation matrix R,

R =(cid:0)l m n(cid:1)T

.

(1)
The rows {l, m, n} of R form an orthonormal triad nα =
{l, m, n}.
In other words, R is a rotation that brings
the triad nα = {l, m, n} into coincidence with a ﬁxed
“laboratory” frame ea = {e1, e2, e3} and can be deﬁned
by three Euler angles with respect to the unit vectors ea.
The determinant of R deﬁnes the handedness or chirality
of the triad,
σ = det R = abc(l ⊗ m ⊗ n)abc = l · (m × n) = ±1, (2)

which is and pseudoscalar and invariant under the proper
rotations SO(3). Moreover, due to O(3) = SO(3) ×

pseudoscalar chiral order parameter is a requisite associ-
ated with the handedness or chirality of the proper point
groups {Cn, Dn, T, O, I} that are subgroups of the group
of proper three-dimensional rotations SO(3).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
discuss the general framework and present our main re-
sult the classiﬁcation of the order parameter tensors for
three-dimensional point groups and discuss their rela-
tion to the subgroup structure. In Section III, we review
the gauge theory description of generalized nematics and
show it can act as an eﬃcient order parameter genera-
tor. The procedure of deriving the order parameters is
demonstrated in Section III C and we discuss how to mea-
sure these order parameters in simulations from a more
practical view point in Section III D. We discuss many
examples in Section IV before concluding in Section V
with an outlook.

II. ORIENTATIONAL ORDERING TENSORS

In this Section we announce our main result in Table
I. In order for the reader to able to read Table I, we ﬁrst
discuss the general problem of determining order param-
eter tensor, then specify our conventions and discuss the
broad classiﬁcations of in terms of the structure of three-
dimensional point groups.

R = σ(cid:101)R = σ((cid:101)l

(cid:101)m (cid:101)n)T

where (cid:101)R ∈ SO(3) and its rows ˜nα = {˜l, ˜m, ˜n} are pseu-

dovectors. The O(3) constraints RT R = RRT = 1 and
det R = ±1 of course reduce the free parameters to the
three Euler angles Ω = (θ, φ, ϕ) and chirality in the frame
ea but we will ﬁnd the vector notation with the O(3)-
constraints understood very useful in the following.

(3)

In the general case, the order parameter has to be in-
variant under all unbroken point-group transformations.
As a result, an orientational order parameter with a point
group symmetry G is deﬁned by G-invariant tensors con-
structed from the triad R or nα = {l, m, n}. These ten-
sors are equivalent to higher order multipoles or (three-
dimensional) spherical harmonics. We will denote these
order parameters tensors composed of the triads generi-
cally as OG, where the additional label speciﬁes the sym-
metry group G when appropriate. Concretely, in the
above two examples, the order parameter tensor is the
magnetization vector OC∞v [n] = n and the second rank
tensor or director OD∞h [n] = Q[n], respectively. Finally,
we note that besides the orientational order, a proper
point-group symmetry such as {Cn, Dn, T, O, I}, which
also breaks the chiral symmetry of O(3), as quantiﬁed
with the composite order parameter σ deﬁned in Eq. (2).
We also note that O(3)-triad order parameters R eﬀec-
tively also arise e.g. in spin-models with non-homogenous
ordering associated with a sublattice structures [31].
As OG needs to be uniquely invariant under a given
symmetry G in the hierarchy in Fig. 1, it is in gen-
eral highly non-trivial to construct its explicit form, even
though the polynomial invariants of 3D points groups
have been computed a long time ago [37, 38] and the
representation theory of SO(3) is known. As a cen-
tral result, we will discuss a systematic and straightfor-
ward framework to derive these order parameter tensors
in Sections III and III C, the result of which is shown
in Table I. We show the lowest order invariant tensors
OG for several point groups, where OG = OG[l, m, n]
for polyhedral groups; OG = {AG, BG} for axial groups,
where AG = AG[n] is the order parameter for the main
axis n and BG = BG[l, m] or BG[l, m, n] denote sec-
ondary order parameters deﬁning the in-plane structure
for the ﬁnite axial groups. We note that amongst the
ordering tensors in Table I, the C1 order parameters
OC1 [l, m, n] = {AC∞v [n], BC1 [l, m]} = {l, m, n} simply
constitute the original O(3)-rotor order parameter R of
a phase with no unbroken symmetry (C1 is the trivial
group); OD2h = {OD∞h [n], BD2h [l, m]} compose the well
known order parameter tensors for D2h-biaxial nematics;
OC∞v [n] and OD∞h[n] are the classical Heisenberg spin n
and uniaxial director Q[n], respectively; OOh [l, m, n] has
been discussed in Ref. [18]; OTd [l, m, n] and OIh [l, m, n]
appear in a diﬀerent form in Ref. [14], where an incom-
plete classiﬁcation of order parameters for subgroups of
SO(3) is also discussed. In a recent paper [24], a classi-
ﬁcation of unique set of order parameters for subgroups

3

of SO(3) was carried out. These order parameters, how-
ever, are not the most elementary (“strongest” in the
terminology of Ref. 24) set of order parameters possible,
in the sense that for individual order parameters, when
allowed by symmetry, OG (cid:54)= 0 does not necessary imply
G order but also G(cid:48)-ordering for G ⊂ G(cid:48) or have the
lowest possible rank. On the other hand, the gauge the-
oretical approach naturally provides such minimal order
parameters allowed by the symmetries, as we highlight
in Section III. In summary, many of the order parameter
tensors in Table I are new and have not been classiﬁed in
the context of a single uniﬁed framework for the (proper
and inproper) rotational symmetries of O(3).

B. Point groups and invariant tensors

In Table I, where the standard Sch¨onﬂies notation is
used [38, 39], we show the order parameter tensors for all
the 32 crystallographic point groups, the 2 icosahedral
groups and the 5 inﬁnite axial groups. These tensors can
be divided into three classes in terms of the structure of
point group symmetries. Together with the handedness
ﬁelds σ, they can uniquely deﬁne the order parameter for
the symmetries mentioned above.
subgroups of O(3) = SO(3) × {1,−1}:

We ﬁrst note the following well-known structure of the

(i) Proper point groups {Cn, Dn, T, O, I} that are sub-

groups of SO(3).

(ii) Improper subgroups of the form G = H ×
{1,−1} for H ⊂ SO(3),
including axial groups
{Sn, Cnh, Dnh} for even and inﬁnite n (C∞h (cid:39) S∞,
D∞d (cid:39) D∞h), Dnd for odd n and polyhedral
groups {Th, Oh, Ih}.

(iii) Improper

subgroups G that do not contain
−1,
including all axial groups Cnv for all n,
{Sn, Cnh, Dnh} for odd n, Dnd for even n and the
regular tetrahedral group Td. These groups are of
the form G = H ∪ −(G(cid:48) \ H), where H is a normal
subgroup of index two for G(cid:48) ⊂ SO(3) [38, 39].

Our point groups are deﬁned in the coordinate system
spanned by the unit triad vectors nα = {l, m, n} set up
in the following way. All point groups have the origin as
their ﬁxed point. The rotational axis of cyclic rotation
groups Cn of is chosen to be n. The dihedral group Dn
has an additional generator in terms of a π-rotation along
the vector l or m. The group Cnv is augmented with a
“vertical” reﬂection in the plane (l, n). The groups Cnh
and Dnh have an additional “horizontal” reﬂection plane
(l, m). The group Dnd has vertical reﬂection planes in
terms of bisectors of the dihedral π-rotation axes. The
groups Sn are composed of n-fold rotoreﬂections in the
plane l, m. The polyhedral groups T, Td, Th and O, Oh
are deﬁned in terms of a (tetrahedron embedded) in a
cube with face normals nα = {l, m, n}. The group Ih is
the symmetry group of an icosahedron with vertices at

second column speciﬁes the type {O, A, B} of the order parameter tensors constructed from the O(3) triad R = (l, m, n)T . The
third column gives the explicit form of ordering tensors in the chosen coordinates. They are traceless and vanish in the isotropic
phase. The inﬁnite axial groups {C∞, C∞v, C∞h, D∞, D∞h} require a single ordering tensor, A[n], describing the orientation
of their primary symmetry axis, chosen to be n; the ﬁnite axial groups {Cn, Cnv, Cnh, Sn, Dn, Dnh, Dnd} require two ordering
tensors, A[n] and B[l, m] or B[l, m, n], for their primary axis and perpendicular in-plane structure, respectively; the polyhedral
groups {T, Td, Th, O, Oh, I, Ih}, which treat {l, m, n} symmetrically, require only one ordering tensor O[l, m, n]. Due to the
symmetry hierarchy, many point groups share ordering tensors (see Section II C). The handedness or chirality σ = det R = ±1,
which is required for proper point groups, these ordering tensors uniquely deﬁne the orientational ordering associated with the
point group symmetries. For example, the order parameters for ﬁnite proper axial groups are given by OG = {AG, BG, σ}. ⊗n

In Table I, we have collected the simplest invariant
tensors for those point groups in the coordinate system

discussed above. Let us now explain the broad charac-
teristics of Table I focusing on the nature of the groups
according to Fig. 1.

1. Continuous axial groups

C. Ordering tensors and the group hierarchy

5

groups

The

ﬁve

inﬁnite

axial

{C∞, C∞v, C∞h, D∞, D∞h} require only one tensor

to deﬁne the associated orientational order. This is
because these groups contain a plane perpendicular to
the vector n with continuous SO(2) or O(2) rotations,
hence their in-plane structure is trivial and the order
parameter eﬀectively reduces to a vector (C∞, C∞v), a
pseudovector (C∞h) or a director (D∞, D∞h), up to an
additional chiral order parameter σ for the proper point
groups.

2. Finite axial groups

Finite axial groups {Cn, Cnv, Sn, Cnh, Dn, Dnh, Dnd}
require two ordering tensors {A, B}: A = A[n] describes
the orientation of the primary axis, which is always cho-
sen as n in Table I, and tensors B = B[l, m] or B[l, m, n]
for the perpendicular in-plane order. This generalizes
well-known structure of the order parameters of biaxial
(D2h) liquid crystals. Due to symmetry relations which
will be discussed later, the primary ordering tensors A[n]
for {Cn, Cnv,} and {Sn, Cnh, Dn, Dnh, Dnd} are identical
to the order parameters OC∞v [n] and OD∞h [n], respec-
tively.

3. Polyhedral groups

The ﬁnite symmetry groups {T, Td, Th, O, Oh, I, Ih} re-
lated to the regular tetrahedron, octahedron and icosa-
hedron, respectively, require only one ordering tensor in-
volving the whole triad nα. These symmetries permute
{l, m, n} “isotropically” amongst each other, so there is
no primary axis and the three axes appear symmetrically
in the order parameter tensor. Moreover, the tetrahedral
symmetries T, Td, Th give an example of the three cat-
egories (i)-(iii) of point groups and will be discussed in
Section IV C.

4. Proper point groups: chirality

Besides the orientational order parameters, the proper
point group symmetries {Cn, Dn, T, O, I} are chiral and
have an additional chiral order parameter. The simplest
chiral order parameter is just the pseudoscalar handed-
ness or chirality σ of the triad deﬁned in Eq. (2). By
deﬁnition, proper point groups do not possess any in-
versions and reﬂections and therefore cannot change the
chirality or handedness of the triad.

As one may have already noticed from the above
discussion and Table I, although a symmetry can be
uniquely deﬁned by the collection of order parameter
tensors OG and the handedness σ, owing to the group
structure discussed above, many orientational ordering
tensors are shared by diﬀerent symmetries. We will now
clarify this by discussing their group structures.
Firstly, the primary ordering tensor AG[n] for Cn and
Cnv groups is just the order parameter tensor of the
C∞ and C∞v groups, ACn [n] = ACv [n] = OC∞[n] =
OC∞v [n]. This is due to the simple fact that Cn and
Cnv groups do not transform n, hence they diﬀer from
C∞ and C∞v only by their in-plane structure related to
BG[l, n]. Similarly, the groups {Sn, Cnh, Dn, Dnh, Dnd}
have the same eﬀect on n, n → −n. Therefore, neglecting
the l and m components, these symmetries lead to the
same primary ordering tensor A[n] = Q[n], the uniaxial
director.
the groups {Cn, Cnh, Cnv, Dn, Dnh} are
closely related in terms of symmetries. Cn and Cnh =
Cn × {1, σh} only diﬀer by a reﬂection σh : n → −n
in the horizontal mirror (l, m)-plane perpendicular to
n. Thus Cn and Cnh have the same in-plane struc-
ture leading to the same secondary order parameter
BCn [l, m]. For the point groups {Cnv, Dn, Dnh}, we have
Dnh = Dn × {1, σh} and Cnv and Dn can be repre-
sented as semi-direct products Cnv = Cn (cid:111) {1, σv} and
Dn = Cn (cid:111){1, c2(l)}, where σv is a reﬂection (l,n)-plane
and c2(l) is a two-fold rotation around the axis l,

It is immediately clear that, σv and c2(l) have the
same action on the l and m components. Therefore,
{Cnv, Dn, Dnh} also have the same in-plane order pa-
rameter B[l, m].

The common structures of the ﬁnite axial groups have
a direct implication on the associated phase transitions.
For a phase with the symmetry of a ﬁnite axial group,
it is in principle possible to disorder the primary and
secondary order separately before the transition to the
isotropic phase. If we ﬁrst disorder the secondary order
in a plane, the following sequences of phase transitions
can happen

Cn, Cnv → C∞v → O(3),
Sn, Cnh, Dn, Dnh, Dnd → D∞h → O(3),

(5)

related to the restoration of the in-plane O(2) symmetry
followed by disordering of order along the principal axis
n. These axial transitions generalize the biaxial-uniaxial-
isotropic liquid transition of biaxial liquid crystals [6, 9].

rate work.

Finally,
T × {1,−1}, Oh = O × {1,−1} and Ih = I × {1,−1}
are generated from the proper subgroups T , O and I by
adding the inversion −1, according to item (ii) in Sec.
II B. Since the ordering tensors of I and O in Table I are
of even rank, this diﬀerence is not reﬂected directly in
the orientational order parameters. There exist higher
order invariant tensors that can distinguish O (I) from
Oh (Ih), nonetheless one needs to consider at least a rank-
5 (rank-7) tensors and it is therefore more convenient to
distinguish them by the chirality σ.
Improper groups possessing only reﬂections but not the
inversions −1 (item (iii) in Sec. II B) have non-vanishing
odd-rank order parameters in general. In these order pa-
rameters, terms related with right- and left-handed triads
appear equally, making the order parameter invariant un-
der certain improper reﬂections but not inversions. This
will be reﬂected in the structure of the associated order
parameters. For instance, as can be seen from Table I,
the order parameter for the tetrahedral-Td group, OTd
consists of a left- and right-handed copy of that of the
tetrahedral-T group (see Section IV C for more details).

III. GAUGE THEORY DESCRIPTION OF

GENERALIZED NEMATIC PHASES

Let us now establish the relation with a recently intro-
duced gauge theoretical description of the G-point group
symmetric degrees of freedom, providing the necessary
apparatus to describe generalized three-dimensional ori-
entational order [36] and the derivation of the order pa-
rameter tensors.

The goal is to construct a coarse-grained order param-
eter theory with local point group symmetries. As in the
previous Section, the well-understood uniaxial nematic
with D∞h-symmetry may be perceived as the guiding
example, maximally simpliﬁed by the Abelian Z2 nature
of the underlying symmetry acting on the order param-
eter, which should be generalized to cope with arbitrary
point group symmetries. In the uniaxial case, the neces-
sary head-to-tail symmetry that turns the coarse-grained
local order parameter vector ni into a director can be sim-
ply accomplished in a Z2 lattice gauge theoretical setting
[41, 42], see also [43]. That is, starting from an auxil-
iary cubic lattice regulating the short-distance cut-oﬀ of
the theory, one can simply describe the coarse grained
order parameter theory in terms of the O(3)-vectors ni
coupled to Z2 gauge ﬁelds. This theory has gauge vari-
ables σij = ±1 living on the bonds (cid:104)ij(cid:105) of the lattice,
σijσjkσklσli
thereby deﬁning Wegner’s Ising gauge theory [44, 45].
The gauge ﬁelds are minimally coupled to the O(3) vec-
tors ni living on the sites of the lattice via a “Higgs” term
σijni · nj favoring nematic alignment. The the-

ory has the local gauge symmetries where ni → −ni and
σij → −σij simultaneously. The term with only gauge
ﬁelds can be understood as encoding the π-disclinations
of the uniaxial nematics. Last but not the least, integrat-
ing over the Z2 gauge ﬁelds leads directly to the eﬀective
ij Tr Qi · Qj in terms of

biaxial Hamiltonian H[n] ∼ (cid:80)

the appropriate order parameter [41].

The above Ising lattice gauge theory is enough to elu-
cidate the nature of gauge theories in general [46]. For
large J the matter and gauge ﬁelds are ordered by the
Higgs mechanism. In addition, the coupling K controls
the gauge ﬁelds and for small K, J the gauge ﬁelds are
conﬁned, while for large K and small J the system is
in a deconﬁning phase with topological gauge ﬂuxes as
excitations. Such “topological nematic phases” [42] have
been identiﬁed only in strongly interacting electron sys-
tems [32, 33, 47–52], while they appear rather unphysical
in the classical liquid crystal setting, where the regime of
interest is the strong gauge coupling K → 0 limit. Here
one ﬁnds the fully ordered “Higgs phase” and a fully dis-
ordered conﬁning phase, which encode for the uniaxial
nematic phase and the isotropic liquid, respectively.

A. General lattice gauge theory model

As emphasized above, the D∞h-symmetry is special
due to the O(2) symmetry in the plane perpendicular to
the ordering axis. In general cases one has to revert to
coarse-grained O(3) rotors parametrized in terms of a
local orthornormal triad as

Ri =(cid:0)li mi ni

(cid:1)T

(6)

a = (nα

according to some ﬁxed coordinate basis ea, instead of
a single vector ni. In the following, we denote the com-
ponents of Ri as (Ri)α
i )a, where greek indices are
i = {li, mi, ni}α=1,2,3
in the local orthonormal basis nα
of the triad and latin indices in the ﬁxed coordinate ba-
sis. The order parameter triad nα
i deﬁnes the local ori-
entation of a G-symmetric “mesogen” and therefore is
subjected to the local identiﬁcations

Again, the goal is to construct a lattice model that gives
rise to a Higgs phase, which now describes generalized
nematic order. Speciﬁcally, the Hamiltonian of the model
is deﬁned as [36]

the rotors Ri ∈ O(3) as

Ri → ΛiRi, Uij → ΛiUijΛT

j , Uij, Λi ∈ G.

(10)

Under a gauge transformation Λi, the plaquette term
transforms as as U(cid:3) → ΛiU(cid:3)Λ−1
and hence the gauge
ﬁeld strength U(cid:3) is deﬁned only up to conjugation and
KCδC(•) is a function on the conjugacy classes C of the

We will ﬁrst discuss how it is automatically guaranteed
that the ordering is of nematic nature and then out-
line the construction of the G-symmetric order parameter
tensor.

Higher rank order parameter tensors like those in Table
I arise in fact naturally from gauge invariant tensors of
the matter ﬁelds Ri in our gauge model Eq. (8). That
is, due to Elitzur’s theorem [58], all gauge non-invariant
tensors vanish. Therefore, on each site, instead of the
matter ﬁelds Ri we have the local tensors Oi = Ri ⊗
Ri ⊗···⊗ Ri carrying upper and lower indices α, β, . . . , γ
and a, b, . . . , c giving rise to physical degrees of freedom.
Each choice of the triad indices α, β, . . . γ leads to a tensor

which is the global symmetry that the nematic state
breaks spontaneously.

The generalization from to the Ising gauge theory rel-
evant in the context of D∞h nematics is obvious. The
Higgs term models the orientational interaction of the
matter ﬁelds Ri, where J is now a G symmetric coupling
matrix,

ΛJΛT = J,

∀Λ ∈ G,

(12)

deﬁning the couplings between the triads, while the sec-
ond term is a defect suppression term. Accordingly, KC
describes the core energy of a defect corresponding to
deﬁcit angle U(cid:3) ∈ G deﬁned up to the conjugacy classes
C of the group G. These gauge defects do not directly
classify topological defects in nematics, but are nonethe-
less closely related via the so-called Volterra construction
[53–55]. The nematic defects are usually classiﬁed topo-
logically in terms of the homotopy groups of the manifold
O(3)/G [56, 57] which is the order parameter space of the
G-nematic and as well the low-energy manifold of the
model Eq.(8) in the Higgs phase. Disordered conﬁgura-
tions can be suppressed by assigning a ﬁnite core-energy
to the gauge defects that proliferate at the phase transi-
tion. Thus, KC can eﬀectively be regarded as tuning the
fugacity of the nematic defects. However, the interesting
“deconﬁned” regime at large KC will be left for future
work and we stress that in the present context of deriv-
ing the order parameters using the gauge symmetries, we
can focus on the gauge theory in the limit KC = 0.

on which the global O(3) rotations act. Such “bi-tensors”
Oi are sometimes referred to as supertensors in the soft-
matter literature [2, 12, 43]. Due to the O(3) constraints,
i.e. the fact that nα
is a local orthonormal triad, not all
i
tensors Oλ
i are independent: the simplest such tensor
relations are given by l⊗ l + m⊗ m + n⊗ n = 1 and Eq.
(2) but we will come back to these later.

The gauge symmetries act on the indices α, β, . . . , γ
and transform these tensors onto linear combinations un-
der the gauge transformations. Formally we can write the
gauge invariant tensors as linear combinations

i has the rank
|λ| = dim λ = dim(α, β, . . . , γ) which is related to el-
ements of ﬁnite order in the point group; if there are
elements of order n, then the rank of the invariant ten-
sors is at least n. On the other hand, Ref. 24 provides
rigorous upper bounds on the rank of the order param-
eter for subgroups of SO(3). All invariant combinations
can be constructed as tensor products of the invariant
tensors, similarly as in the case of point-group invariant
polynomials (i.e. scalars) [37, 38].

Up to this point, we have determined that the gauge

rank tensors that describe long-range order associated
with the spontaneous breaking of the O(3) symmetry,
while the “usual” orientational order (cid:104)Ri(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0 is for-
bidden. Therefore, the physical orientational correla-
tions are in the tensors Oλ[Ri] and the orientational
probability density is given terms of the Hamiltonian as
ρ({Ri}) ∼ 1

We still have to determine the orientational order car-

as expected. We emphasize this diﬀerence with the labels
RL,R (for left- and right actions) on the rotations acting
on the two distinct indices of the “supertensors” O. The
essence is that the problem of classifying the order pa-
rameters and gauge invariant tensors is the equivalent
problem of classifying point group invariant tensors in
the global and local bases ea and nα
i , respectively. Each
tensor Oλ[l, m, n] is classiﬁed by the tensor rank |λ|, the
tensor symmetries of the indices a, b, . . . , c, and can be de-
composed in to the irreducible representations of SO(3)
under rotations in the usual way.

C. Order parameters and the high-temperature

expansion of the gauge theory

The integration over the gauge ﬁelds can be explicitly
performed on the lattice order by order in the expansion.
By construction, the terms appearing must be local terms
that are composed of contractions of gauge invariant ten-
sors. The result is therefore an expression starting with
contractions ∼ Tr [OG
j ] coming from the lowest or-
der non-zero terms nmin ∼ rank OG in the expansions. In
other words, the lowest order non-trivial terms are com-
posed of the lowest order invariant tensors that can be
found from Table I. We emphasize that by construction
these tensors are the minimal and simplest possible set
of invariant tensors allowed by the symmetries.

D. Determining the symmetry of a phase with a

high-rank order parameter

As we discussed, the principle underlying the deriva-
tion of the order parameters is the fundamental gauge
theoretical result: all physical observables have to be
gauge invariant, since gauge symmetries cannot break
spontaneously [58]. By construction, the model Eq. (8)
embodies the symmetry of the order parameter tensors
by the gauge symmetry. Therefore, if we integrate out
the gauge ﬁelds in the Hamiltonian, the terms that sur-
vive are gauge invariant local combinations of the mat-
ter ﬁelds, corresponding to the order parameter tensors.
This can be most easily accomplished in the strong cou-
pling limit of the gauge theory KC = 0, where the gauge
ﬁelds have no independent dynamics. The result is es-
sentially the eﬀective Hamiltonian of the orientational
probability density ρ({Ri}) ∼ 1
e−βH[{Ri},{Uij}]
but in order to ﬁnd the order parameter tensors we do
not need the eﬀective Hamiltonian in closed form and
utilize the high-temperature expansion for small β. The
couplings J do not aﬀect the general form of the expan-
sion and we set them to be isotropic J = J 1 for simplicity
and measure the temperature in the units βJ ≡ β.

The partition function of the model Eq.(8) is deﬁned

Finally, we come back to the issue of determining the
symmetry of a nematic phase. The ordering tensors we
shown in Table I generalize the local director tensor Qab
for uniaxial nematics. The macroscopic order parameters
are deﬁned as coarse grained averages over the system

(cid:88)

(19)

where V denotes the spatial averaging volume. To verify
the symmetry of a phase, one need in principle consider
all independent entries of the order parameter tensor.
This is in general quite involved since the number of the
entries grows exponentially with the rank of the tensor.
However, for interactions favoring homogenous a ne-
matic order, such as the interaction in the gauge model
Eq. (8), the symmetry of the phase can be revealed by
the scalar two point functions in the limit of large separa-
tion. Since (cid:104)OG
i (cid:105) will develop a ﬁnite value in the ordered
phase, at long distances the scalar two point function of

the order parameter tensor behaves as

(20)

The contractions in Tr (•) are determined up to the ten-
sor symmetries of the order parameter. This allows us to
deﬁne a strength for the ordering tensors,

(cid:113)(cid:104)(OG

q =

i )abc...(cid:105)2,

(21)

and the symmetry of the phase can be deﬁned by the
lowest order tensor and “smallest” group G with q (cid:54)=
0. Accordingly, the phase transition(s) associated with
(cid:104)OG
i (cid:105) can be identiﬁed from the susceptibility χ(q) of the
ordering strength,

χ(q) = βV(cid:0)(cid:104)q2(cid:105) − (cid:104)q(cid:105)2(cid:1).

(22)

We have previously numerically computed q and χ(q)
in the model Eq. (8) for large number of point group
symmetries [36]. Our simulations showed that χ(q) will
exhibit a single clear peak at the temperature where the
heat capacity peaks, indicating that q in combination of
simple symmetry arguments is indeed suﬃcient to deter-
mine the symmetry of a nematic phase with homogeneous
distribution of order parameters.

Lastly, we note that, when non-homogeneous distribu-
tions of order parameters are preferred, the symmetry of
a state can be compatible but not identical to G, as also
discussed e.g. in Ref. [43]. In these cases, a non-zero q is
not suﬃcient to identify the symmetry of the state, and
one in principle need consider all components of (cid:104)OG
i (cid:105).
However, the symmetry of a phase may be also deter-
mined by the “eigenvalues” and the distribution of non-
zero entries of (cid:104)OG
i (cid:105) [59]. Studies with this regard so far
mostly concentrate on the rank-2 D∞h and D2h ordering
tensors [12, 60–62], it would be interesting to consider
the ordering of the tensors in Table I in full generality
without assumptions on microscopic conﬁgurations of a
particular model.

IV. EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION

Let us ﬁnally present how we arrived to Table I. For
all ﬁnite and discrete point groups, we can integrate over
the gauge ﬁelds in the expansion (18). For the continuous
axial groups, we can do the integrations in closed form.
The results are by construction composed of local con-
tractions of the simplest gauge invariant tensors allowed
by the symmetries, i.e. the tensors in Table I.

the familiar results. We will use the D∞-uniaxial ne-
matic as an example of the general procedure of deriving
uniaxial nematic order parameters, the others being
similar. The key point is the elimination of the triad
vectors l, m in the plane where the SO(2)-symmetry
acts from the Hamiltonian upon integrating out the
SO(2)-gauge ﬁelds, since there can be no gauge invariant
combinations of these components.

The gauge ﬁelds Uij ∈ D∞ can be generated by the

uniaxial symmetry is given by D∞h = D∞
and follows with minimal modiﬁcations. We focus on
the terms in the (l, m)-plane and parametrize the gauge

be neglected as irrelevant. Note however, that the full
expansion (18) for D∞ contains odd powers of β with
terms of the form β3σiσj[(ni · nj)2 + ··· ] that feature
the chiral order parameter σi. These chiral terms van-
ish identically for the case D∞h when summing over the
gauge ﬁelds Uij = {1,−1} in D∞h = D∞

× {1,−1}.

B. Biaxial nematics

The D∞- and D∞h-uniaxial nematics we just dis-
cussed is a well-known and relatively simple case in
the generalized nematic family. Since the symmetries
{C∞, C∞v, C∞h, D∞, D∞h} all contain a SO(2) part in
the plane perpendicular to the n, the vectors l and m dis-
appear from the order parameter, as we saw above. For
the symmetries {Cn, Cnv, Cnh, Sn, Dn, Dnh, Dnd} with ﬁ-
nite n, however, there will be in-plane rotational symme-
try breaking and we need a secondary “biaxial” order
parameter B[l, m] or B[l, m, n] to capture these phase
transitions.

1. O(3)-constraints and D2h-biaxial order parameter

Let us ﬁrst discuss second rank order parameter ten-
sors. All traceless second order parameter tensors can be
generated from the “supertensor” [2, 12]

Sαβ = nα ⊗ nβ − 1
3

δαβ.

(31)

However, as expected, there are only 5 independent trace-
less symmetric second-rank tensors, due to the relation
Sαα = 0 following from the O(3) constraints

l ⊗ l + m ⊗ m + n ⊗ n = 1.

(32)

It is possible to consider such relations for all higher or-
der “supertensors” Oαβ...γ and decompose them into ir-
reducible SO(3)-representations according to their rank.
As can be seen from the Table I, for some axial nemat-
ics, there exist more than one biaxial order parameters
B. A familiar example is the biaxial D2h-nematic, where
we have the order parameters {BD2h
1 = Sll = l ⊗ l − 1

2 = Smm = m ⊗ m − 1

which are both clearly invariant under D2 generated by
{c2(n), c2(l)} and as well as the inversion −1. Corre-
spondingly, when integrating over Uij ∈ D2h in the ex-
pansion Eq.(18), in the ﬁrst non-trivial order one will
obtain the scalar contractions

∼ (lalb)i(lalb)j + (mamb)i(mamb)j + (nanb)i(nanb)j
= Tr[Q · Q] + Tr[B1 · B1] + Tr[B2 · B2] + const
(34)

which cannot be written as a contraction a single local
quantity like in Eq.
(30). However, due to the O(3)-
(32), the commonly used D2h biaxial
constraints Eq.
order parameter tensor B = l⊗ l− m⊗ m is just a linear
combination of {BD2h
(34) reduces to
contractions of the two independent rank-2 tensors.

} and Eq.

2. Generalized biaxial order parameters

To discuss derivation of a secondary order parameter
B of higher rank, we will use the D2d-nematic as an
example. The D2d group is generated by the elements
{c2(n), c2(m), σmn}, where

 −1 0 0

0 −1 0
0 1

 , σmn =

 −1 0 0

 (35)

c2(n) =

are a 2-fold rotation about n and a reﬂection in the (m, n)
plane and c2(m) is as that in Eq.(23).

These lead to a 4-fold symmetry in the (l, m)-plane.
To obtain the order parameter describing this symmetry
breaking, we follow the same procedure discussed in the
previous section, but now the gauge ﬁelds Uij in Eq.(18)
are elements of D2d. Integrating over Uij ∈ D2d, one will
ﬁnd that the ﬁrst non-trivial order is the second order
with a term (ni · nj)2, which indicates as expected that
Q[n] is as well an order parameter for D2d nematics. The
4-fold rotational symmetry combined with the reﬂections
starts showing up at the third order in Eq.(18), where one
ﬁnds the following contractions up to a constant factor
∼ σiσj

·(cid:2)(l ⊗ m + m ⊗ l) ⊗ n(cid:3)

(cid:21)

,

i

j

(36)
where the third-rank contraction Tr(•abc · •abc) is deter-
mined up to the symmetries of the order parameter tensor
(symmetric in the ﬁrst two indices). By construction, the
local quantity appeared in Eq.(36) is D2d invariant, hence
can be used to deﬁne a D2d-biaxial order parameter,

BD2d = (l ⊗ m + m ⊗ l) ⊗ n.

(37)

The full order parameter of a D2d nematic is therefore
given by

OD2d [l, m, n] = {AD∞h [n], BD2d [l, m]}.

(38)

The above procedure of deriving the biaxial order pa-
rameter is valid for all axial nematics with ﬁnite n-fold
rotational symmetries. Naturally, the rank of the biax-
ial order parameter tensor increases with n and becomes
inﬁnite when n → ∞. This reﬂects the fact that a bi-
axial order parameter does not exist for phases with an
in-plane SO(2) symmetry, {C∞, C∞v, C∞h, D∞, D∞h}.

11

C. Polyhedral nematics

Let us end by discussing the order parameters for the

polyhedral groups.

The proper tetrahedral group T can be generated by a
two-fold rotation c2(n), as that in Eq. (35), and a three-
fold rotation acting as a cyclic permutation of {l, m, n}
given by

c3(l + m + n) =

(39)

 0 1 0

0 0 1
1 0 0

 .

These result in 12 proper rotations that leave a tetrahe-
dron embedded in a cube with normals l, m, n invariant.
After summing over gauge ﬁelds Uij ∈ T in the expan-
sion Eq. (18), one ﬁnds in the third order the following
local contractions,

·(cid:0)(cid:88)
(cid:3)
˜l ⊗ ˜m ⊗ ˜n(cid:1)
∼ σiσjTr(cid:2)(cid:0)˜l ⊗ ˜m ⊗ ˜n(cid:1)
Tr(cid:2)(cid:0)(cid:88)
·(cid:0)(cid:88)

l ⊗ m ⊗ n(cid:1)
where (cid:80)

There is yet another point group belonging to the
tetrahedral group family, the group Th = T × {1,−1}.
Interestingly, due to Th = T × {1,−1}, all odd orders in

terms appear in the fourth order with the contractions,

Ref.

rotations in Ih, it contains numerous terms. To highlight
the complexity, and as well the advantage of our gauge
theory Eq. (8), however, we present the full expanded
form of OIh in Appendix A.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

where we have subtracted the trace. The ﬁrst term in Eq.
(46) actually coincides with the Oh ordering tensor OOh .
This is because Oh/Th (cid:39) {1,−σd} is a group of order two
that leads to some redundant information at even orders
in the expansion. OTh in Eq. (47) is not invariant under
interchanging l and m , which corresponds to the four
fold rotation in Oh. Therefore, we can deﬁne another
Th-invariant tensor,

Gennes paradigm, each symmetry is accompanied by
a order parameter and associated phase transitions.
These order parameters are high-rank tensors and quite
involved in general. As result, this remaining frontier of
phenomenological Landau-de Gennes order parameter
theory has remained rather elusive, apart from the
extensively discussed and experimentally realized cases
of uniaxial and biaxial nematics. However, also the
challenge of the experimental realization of generalized
nematics might be overcome in the near future in view
of the rapid experimental advances in the availability
and control of new promising platforms for generalized
nematic phases.
In this paper, we have completed
the ﬁrst step towards bridging this theoretical gap by

orientational ordering with unbroken three-dimensional

most relevant symmetries. Although we arrived to these
results utilizing the gauge theoretical lattice model we

constructed earlier for the study of generalized nematics
[36], the results are of course independent of the gauge
theoretical machinery. In addition to our lattice model,
with the order parameters it is in principle possible
to study the nematic phases via Landau-de Gennes
theories by considering all symmetry allowed couplings
of the order parameters, for example using the approach
outlined in Ref.
16. Given the universality of the
applications of the orientational tensor order parameters
our work is of general interest for many diﬀerent ﬁelds, in
particular we anticipate that our results can provide for a

road map for the search of new nematic phases of matter.

Appendix A: The Ih ordering tensor

15

In Eq. (51) we presented the order parameter tensor, OIh , of an icosahedral phase in a compact form. Due to the
high rank and the ﬁve-fold rotation, OIh is in fact highly complex. This complexity is avoided in the gauge theory
Eq. (8), however, it will show up in traditional Landau theories. To highlight the advantage of our gauge theory, here
we present the full expanded form of OIh .
