Trions and biexcitons in anisotropic two-dimensional materials are investigated within an eﬀective
mass theory. Explicit results are obtained for phosphorene and arsenene, materials that share
features such as a direct quasi-particle gap and anisotropic conduction and valence bands. Trions
are predicted to have remarkably high binding energies and an elongated electron-hole structure with
a preference for alignment along the armchair direction, where the eﬀective masses are lower. We ﬁnd
that biexciton binding energies are also notably large, especially for monolayer phosphorene, where
they are found to be twice as large as those for typical monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

PACS numbers:

Recently discovered few-layer semiconductors, such as
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and black
phosphorus1,2 (phosphorene, or bP), have given rise
to a class of novel quasi-two-dimensional (2D) mate-
rials. Phosphorene, in particular, has attracted inter-
est due to its unique properties, namely a direct band-
gap with a highly anisotropic band structure3,4 and high
carrier mobilities.1,2 Technological applications, such as
phosphorene-based ﬁeld eﬀect transistors5 and photode-
tector devices,6,7 have been proposed, suggesting that
this material might play an important role in opto-
electronics in the near future. Few-layer arsenic (ar-
senene) has been theoretically demonstrated to be sta-
ble and to share many of the electronic properties with
phosphorene.
In particular, it is also a single-element
crystalline layer, with highly anisotropic bands and a di-
rect band gap.8,9 Most importantly, the band anisotropy
in both materials gives rise to unique physical properties,
e.g. direction-dependent eﬀective masses,10 mobilities,1
and excitonic polarizabilities,11 features expected to yield
avenues for new device applications.12

One of

the hallmarks of atomically thin two-
dimensional materials is their unprecedented high exci-
ton binding energies, which arise as a consequence of the
reduced screening of the electron-hole Coulomb interac-
tion by the environment surrounding the layer. Such
strong electron-hole interactions allow for the observa-
tion of a clear Rydberg series of excitonic states,13,14
as well as resolved trion and biexciton peaks in opto-
electronic experiments.15–18 In addition, reduced dimen-
sionality leads to deviations from the standard 3D form
of the electron-hole interaction, which results in clear
deviations from the hydrogenic form of excitonic level
spacing.19–22

Interest in higher order excitonic complexes in black
phosphorus has recently been boosted by experimental
claims of trion binding energies as high as ∼100 meV
as measured by photoluminescence.18 Such a huge trion
binding energy would be of great importance, allowing for

the possibility that a tightly bound trion could be driven
by in plane electric ﬁelds without dissociation. This ex-
perimental result was rationalized within the context of
a quasi-one-dimensional charge-complex model,18,23 aris-
ing from the high eﬀective mass anisotropy in this system,
and highlights the possibility that material anisotropy
may lead to novel eﬀects associated with larger electron-
hole complexes.

In this work, we calculate trion and biexciton binding
energies in anisotropic 2D materials, with special empha-
sis on n-layer black phosphorus (n-bP) and the recently
theoretically proposed n-layer arsenene (n-As). Our re-
sults show that, although larger than the usual trion and
biexciton binding energies in the TMDCs, the trion bind-
ing energies in these materials are signiﬁcantly lower than
those claimed in recent experimental works. Possible rea-
sons for this (apparent) discrepancy between experimen-
tal and theoretical values are addressed, and the validity
of the 1D model23 of trion binding energies in this system
is questioned.

trion, where an extra hole h′ (electron e′) with eﬀective
mass mx(y)

the third and fourth kinetic energy terms to the exci-
tonic pair represented by the ﬁrst two terms. The inter-
action potential between charges is assumed to be of the

Here, qe(h) is the electron (hole) charge and ǫ1(2) is the
eﬀective dielectric constant of the vacuum (substrate)
above (below) the layer. H0 and Y0 are the Struve and
Neumann functions, respectively, and ρ0 = ndǫ/(ǫ1 + ǫ2)
is the screening length, where d is the layer width, as-
sumed to be approximately equal to the inter-layer dis-
tance (5.19˚A and 5.00 ˚A for n-bP and n-As, respec-
tively). The eﬀective dielectric constant ǫ within the
layer is taken to be ǫ = 10ǫ0 for both materials.24,25

Without any further simpliﬁcation, one can obtain
ground state properties of the full Hamiltonian [Eq. (1)]
by diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations,26,27 as ex-
plained in detail in the Supplementary Material. Since
DMC does not require storing a ﬁne mesh and large ar-
rays associated with the wave functions, this method re-
quires much lower computational memory as compared to
ﬁnite diﬀerence-based methods, which makes it suitable
for problems with a large number of variables, allowing
for the description of larger exciton complexes such as
biexcitons. On the other hand, bare DMC calculations
do not directly provide the wave functions, although pair
correlation functions can still be extracted by the forward
walking method.28

As an alternative approach, we propose another
method for obtaining excitons and trions eigenstates,
that is based on the so-called split-operator technique.29
Just like DMC, this method uses imaginary time (τ = it)
evolution, but now with the imaginary time evolution
operator U (τ + ∆τ, τ ) = exp(−H∆τ /), whose poten-
tial and kinetic energy terms are conveniently split into
a series of exponentials,

U (τ + ∆τ, τ ) ≈ e− ∆τ

 T1 e− ∆τ

 T2 ...e− ∆τ

 TN e− ∆τ

where Ti is the kinetic energy term in the i-direction (for
a system with N dimensions). This approximation, based
on the Suzuki-Trotter expansion, has a O(∆τ 3) error,
which is controlled here by using a small imaginary time-
step ∆τ .29–31 By propagating an arbitrary initial wave
function in imaginary time, this method directly yields
the trion ground state energy ET and the trion wave
function, but requires storing a high-dimensional numer-
ical array. In this case, reducing the number of variables
of the system is of essence. For negatively charged tri-
ons, this is achieved by following the procedure proposed
in Refs. [23,32], which is generalized for the anisotropic
case in the Supplementary Material. This procedure re-
duces the six-dimensional Hamiltonian, Eq.
(1), to a
four-dimensional one using the relative coordinates be-
tween the ﬁrst electron and the hole, ~R = ~rh − ~re, i.e.
the exciton coordinates, and between the second electron

2

and the exciton center-of-mass, ~r = ~re′ − ~Rcm
exc. Adapt-
ing this procedure to deal with a positively charged trion
(H+) is straightforward. Throughout this paper, we will
use either DMC or split-operator methods, whenever con-
venient. Material parameters for n-bP and n-As are ob-
tained from Refs. 10 and 9, respectively.

The ground state exciton binding energy EX

is ob-

the neutral exciton Hamiltonian [see, e.g. Eq.
(3) of
Ref.
[11]]. We then subtract the numerically obtained
exciton and trion energies to calculate the trion binding
energy ET
b − ET . Figure 1(a) shows the positive
(X +, open red symbols) and negative (X −, closed black
symbols) trion energies of n-bP (squares) and n-As (tri-
angles), obtained by DMC calculations, as a function of
the number of layers n. We ﬁrst take a suspended sample,
by setting ǫ2 = ǫ0.33 Since electrons and holes have simi-
lar masses in both materials, positive and negative trions
have almost the same energy, although a few meV separa-

tion can be observed for lower number of layers in n-bP,
where the electron-hole mass disparity is enhanced.9,10
Due to such high similarity between X − and X + states,
results for the latter are omitted in the subsequent dis-
cussion. Results obtained with the split-operator method
for X − are shown for n-bP and n-As as blue stars and
diamonds, respectively, and agree well with the DMC re-
sults.

Charge carriers in these materials exhibit diﬀerent ef-
fective masses along diﬀerent directions, which results in
a distinct spatial extent of the x and y components of
the position vectors ~r and ~R deﬁning the trion. These
quantities are calculated separately for the exciton ( ~R)
and electron-exciton center-of-mass (e-c.m., ~r) contribu-
tions to the overall wave function, respectively, which are
illustrated in Fig. 1(b) for X − in n-bP (squares) and n-
As (triangles). We observe that both the exciton (full
symbols) and the e-c.m.
(open symbols) distributions
are wider in the (armchair) x-direction, due to the lower
eﬀective masses in this direction. The anisotropy of the
probability distributions in n-As is strongly enhanced as
the number of layers increases, as a consequence of the
increase of the hole eﬀective mass in the y-direction.9

The behavior of the electron and hole distributions in
anisotropic trions is further illuminated by looking at the
correlation functions between the particles. Due to the
particular choice of coordinates in our calculations, it is

tions are shown along the x = 0 (solid) and y = 0
(dashed) axis in Fig. 2(a). The maximum of the e-c.m.
function ge−c.m. is clearly displaced from the (x, y) =
(0, 0) point, which is reasonable, since this function de-
scribes the probability distribution for an electron inter-
acting with an exciton, which provides both repulsive
(due to the second electron) and attractive (due to the
hole) contributions to the potential. Results for ge-c.m. in
a system with the same parameters as 1-bP, but assum-
ing isotropic eﬀective masses mx
e = 0.17m0 and
mx
h = 0.15m0, are shown as a blue dotted curve,
for comparison.

h = my

e = my

The anisotropy of the excitonic component ge-h be-
comes even more evident in the two-dimensional contour
plot of the correlation functions, as illustrated in Fig.
2(b), which is clearly stretched out along the x-axis. As
for the e-c.m. component, Fig. 2(c) shows that the eﬀec-
tive mass anisotropy leads to a function with two clear
peaks along the x-axis. In fact, since the electrons in the
X − trion repel each other, they are expected to seek the
largest possible separation. On the other hand, electrons
and holes attract each other. Thus the lowest energy situ-
ation that satisﬁes a large (short) electron-electron(hole)
separation is expected to be the one where the three par-
ticles form an electron-hole-electron (e-h-e) line.23 The
e-h-e line could be along any direction in an isotropic ma-
terial, as veriﬁed by ge-c.m. for the isotropic case in Fig.
2(d), where the correlation function is circularly sym-
metric with a peak at r 6= 0. However, since n-bP has
anisotropic eﬀective masses, the line along the x (arm-
chair) direction, where eﬀective masses are lower, is the
most energetically favourable. This linear trion structure
has been used18 in an eﬀectively 1D trion model, follow-
ing the steps of Ref.
[23], from which a trion energy
of ∼ 100 meV was obtained. Among the major issues
for the validity of this model in the present context is
the fact that it has been developed for a material with
isotropic bands, where electrons and holes interact via a
bare Coulomb potential, which is not the case for exci-
tons and trions in few-layer phosphorene, as previously
discussed.

So far, the trion binding energies have been obtained
for a suspended sample, i.e. without a substrate. Tri-
ons in suspended 1-bP are found to have a remarkably
high binding energy ET
b = 51.6 meV, as compared to
monolayer TMDCs [c.f. Fig. 1(a)]. However, in recent
experimental measurements of excitons and trion states
in 1-bP,18,24 the phospherene layer has been deposited

on a SiO2 substrate (ǫ2 = 3.8ǫ0). The trion binding
energy in 2D materials is reduced by screening of the
electron-hole interaction potential due to its surrounding
media. In order to address this issue, we have calculated
the dependence of the trion binding energies on the di-
electric constant of the substrate, ǫ2, which is shown in
Fig. 3 for n-bP and n-As.33 We observe that if one as-
sumes a SiO2 substrate below the layer, the trion binding
energy of 1-bP decreases to ∼34.2 meV, which is much
lower than the 100 meV claimed in recent experiments.18
One could argue that, even in the presence of a sub-
strate, the remarkably high 51 meV trion binding energy
found for ǫ2 = ǫ0 could still be valid if, for instance, the
measurement is made in a region of the layer where it
is accidentally suspended from the surface of the sub-
strate. On the other hand, the exciton peak in that
experiment was located near 1.75 eV, whereas the ex-
citon binding energy for ǫ2 = ǫ0 in our model is found to
be EX
b ≈ 0.744 eV, which implies an electronic (quasi-
particle) gap of ≈ 2.494 eV, inconsistent with ab initio
band structure calculations available in the literature for
this material.3,10,24,34 Assuming ǫ2 = 3.8ǫ0, one obtains
EX
b ≈ 0.405 eV, suggesting an electronic gap of ≈ 2.155
eV, which is in good agreement with ab initio results and
corroborates with the picture of a screened trion, with a
lower binding energy of ET

b = 34.16 meV.

Finally, we have performed DMC calculations to ob-
tain the biexciton energies EXX in suspended n-bP and
n-As layers, as shown in Table I. The biexciton Hamilto-
nian is obtained from Eq. (1) by simply adding an extra
charge and properly adapting the potential. The biexci-
ton binding energies are obtained as EXX

more sophisticated GW-Bethe-Salpeter calculations for
n-bP.35 The biexciton energies are surprisingly large, es-
pecially for 1-bP, where they are almost twice as large
as those of monolayer TMDCs,36 which should motivate
the search for an experimental observation of biexciton
peaks in these 2D materials.

In summary, we have calculated trion and biexciton
energies in two examples of anisotropic 2D materials:
few layer phosphorene and the recently theoretically pro-
posed arsenene. Although binding energies of these
charge complexes are found to be much higher than in
their bulk counterparts and even higher than in other
2D materials, such as TMDCs, they are much lower than
the remarkably high ∼100 meV trion energy claimed for
phosphorene in recent experiments.18 Such a high trion
binding energy was explained as due to the quasi-1D na-
ture of trions in this system, as a result of its highly
anisotropic eﬀective masses. In this case, arsenene would
also exhibit such high trion energies, which is not pre-
dicted by our theory. It is important to note that the ob-
servation of trion binding energies in optical experiments
such as photoluminescence and absorption strongly de-
pends on the doping of the sample under investigation.37
This issue was indeed addressed by the authors of Ref.
[18], who noted that the excitation power in their photo-
luminescence experiments is enhanced to reduce the in-
ﬂuence of doping on the results. However, this study was
performed only within the range from 0.19 to 1.15 µW,
since higher excitation power would damage the sam-
ple. Within this range, the trion energy peak mono-
tonically decreases almost linearly, making it diﬃcult
to properly estimate the exact converged value of the
trion binding energy. Consequently, the 100 meV esti-
mate in this experiment can only be seen as an upper
bound, as emphasized by the authors of Ref.
In
this sense, the lower trion binding energies found in our
study, and conﬁrmed by diﬀerent calculation methods,
suggest that either: (i) trions in this system are not prop-
erly described by Wannier-Mott theory, or (ii) the upper
bound for the trion binding energy observed in recent ex-

[18].

periments with bP is still somewhat far from its actual
value. Since Wannier-Mott theory has been successfully
used to model experimentally obtained excitonic spectra
for diﬀerent 2D materials, and because our model yields
exciton binding energies in bP in good agreement with
ab initio calculations, it would appear that the Wannier-
Mott approach is sound. Our results then imply that
more detailed experiments on trions in few layer bP are
needed, e.g.
investigating the inﬂuence of an external
gate potential on the trion peak position, so as to reduce
the eﬀect of doping by controlling the Fermi level of the
system.37

25 Notice that, although slightly anisotropic, the dielectric
constant of bulk bP in each direction has similar values,
ǫx = 12.5ǫ0, ǫy = 10ǫ0, and ǫz = 8ǫ0. Therefore, here
we use a geometric mean for the dielectric constant of n-
bP, ǫ = 3√ǫxǫyǫz = 10ǫ0, following Ref. [24]. As for n-As,
dielectric constants are still missing in the literature, thus,
we consider here the same value of ǫ as in bP, which is
expected to be at least in the same order of magnitude.

paring the model of Eq. (2) with ab initio calculations sug-
gests that, at least for isotropic 2D materials, the model
of Eq. (2) gives a quantitative account of the eﬀective
electron-hole interaction in the isolated monolayer case,
but produces binding energies that are too small when ad-
ditional layers or a substrate is present. Nevertheless, this
does not change our conclusions regarding trion binding
energies, since the (presumed accurate) monolayer result
yields an upper bound which is still signiﬁcantly below
that of Ref. [18].

SPLIT-OPERATOR METHOD: RELATIVE AND

CENTER-OF-MASS COORDINATES

In order to reduce the number of dimensions in our
trion calculations with the split-operator technique, we
use the relative and center-of-mass coordinates between
the ﬁrst electron and the hole, ~R = ~rh − ~re and ~Rcm
exc,
with corresponding momenta ~P and ~P cm
exc, respectively,
to obtain

H− =

)−1 are the anisotropic total and reduced eﬀective
masses of the ﬁrst electron-hole pair, respectively. We
then employ a similar transformation in Eq. (1), but now
using the second electron (related to the last two kinetic
energy terms) and the center-of-mass between the ﬁrst
pair (related to the ﬁrst two kinetic energy terms) [3]:
~r = ~re′ − ~Rcm

with corresponding momenta ~p and ~P(cm), respectively,

the potential term V−(|~rh − ~re|, |~re′ − ~rh|, |~re′ − ~re|) =
V−(~r, ~R) does not depend on the total center-of-mass
coordinate ~Rcm of the system, allowing us to take the
ﬁrst two terms of H− in Eq. (2) to be zero and, thus,
reduce our problem to (numerically) solving a (non-
separable) 4-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation, which is
feasible with modern computers. This choice of coordi-
nates is schematically represented in Fig. 1 for a nega-
tively charged trion, i.e. with two electrons and one hole,
represented by blue and red dots, respectively. Adapt-
ing this procedure to deal with a positively charged trion
(H+) is straightforward.

DIFFUSION MONTE CARLO: JASTROW TERM

Since the diﬀusion Monte Carlo technique has been
widely used and frequently reviewed in the literature, we

will restrict ourselves here to the discussion of the details
relevant for our model. For a more complete account
of the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) technique, we refer
to e.g. Ref. [4] and the Supplementary Material of Ref.
[5]. As in the split-operator technique, DMC calculations
consist of solving the imaginary time Schr¨odinger equa-
tion to project out excited states from an arbitrary initial
wave function Ψ(~r, t = 0), so that after a long imaginary
time propagation, the wave function converges to the
ground state of the system. However, in this approach,
one deﬁnes a mixed probability f (~r, t) = ΨT ( ~R)Ψ(~r, t),
which leads to an equation of motion for f (~r, t) that can
be solved by approximate Greens functions that result in
drift-diﬀusion motion and branching action.[4] The guid-
ing function is deﬁned as ΨT (~r) = eJ(~r), with a Jastrow
term that, in this work, contains two-body electron-hole
and electron-electron contributions adapted speciﬁcally
for the case of negative trions in the Keldysh potential
[Eq. (2) of the main manuscript], [6]

J(~r) = uee(˜ree′ ) + ueh(˜reh) + ueh(˜re′h),

sampling. These equations are straightforwardly adapted
to describe positively charged trions, just by replacing
uee → uhh, ˜ree′ → ˜rhh′ , and ˜re′h → ˜reh′ . The modiﬁed
