SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT

STACKS

ˇSPELA ˇSPENKO AND MICHEL VAN DEN BERGH

Abstract. If G is a reductive group which acts on a linearized smooth scheme X
then we show that under suitable standard conditions the derived category
D(X ss/G) of the corresponding GIT quotient stack X ss/G has a semi-or-
thogonal decomposition consisting of derived categories of coherent sheaves
of rings on X ss//G which are locally of ﬁnite global dimension. One of the
components of the decomposition is a certain non-commutative resolution of
X ss//G constructed earlier by the authors.

The results in this paper also complement a result by Halpern-Leistner (and
similar results by Ballard-Favero-Katzarkov and Donovan-Segal) that asserts
the existence of a semi-orthogonal decomposition of D(X/G) in which one of
the parts is D(X ss/G).

1. Introduction

1.1. Main result. Throughout k is an algebraically closed base ﬁeld of character-
istic 0. All schemes are k-schemes. If Λ is a right noetherian ring then we write
D(Λ) for Db
f (Λ) ⊂ D(Λ), the bounded derived category of right Λ-modules with
ﬁnitely generated cohomology. Similarly for a noetherian scheme/stack X we write
D(X ) := Db
coh(X ) and if A is a quasi-coherent sheaf of noetherian algebras on a
stack X then we write D(A) for Db

A semi-orthogonal decomposition eE = heEi | i ∈ Ii is a list of triangulated sub-
presheaves (eEi)i∈I of eE indexed by a totally ordered set I such that for each open
U ⊂ X we have a semi-orthogonal decomposition eE(U ) = heEi(U ) | i ∈ Ii.
If X is noetherian then we write eDX for the presheaf of triangulated categories
similarly put eDA(U ) = D(A | U ).
categories eDX/G on X//G as follows: if U ⊂ X//G is open then we put eDX/G(U ) =

Let G be a reductive group acting on a k-scheme X such that a good quotient
π : X → X//G exists (see §3.3 below). Then we deﬁne a presheaf of triangulated

Theorem 1.1.2. Let G be a reductive group acting on a smooth variety X such
that a good quotient π : X → X//G exists and put ˜D = ˜DX/G. There exist one-
parameter subgroups λi : Gm → G of G, open subgroups ¯Gλi of Gλi and ﬁnite

D((U ×X//G X)/G).

dimensional ¯Gλi -representations Ui, such that eD = h. . . , eD−2, eD−1, eD0i with eD−i ∼=
eDΛi for sheaves of OX λi // ¯Gλi -algebras (viewed as OX//G-algebras) deﬁned by Λi ∼=

(End(Ui) ⊗k π∗OX λi ) ¯Gλi . The restrictions of Λi to aﬃne opens have ﬁnite global
dimension.

In this theorem the notation (−)λi was used for the ﬁxed points under λi (see
§3.3 below). Note that Gλi is a reductive subgroup of G (see §3.6) acting on X λi.
Theorem 1.1.2 applies in particular to GIT stack quotients of the form X ss/G
where X is a smooth projective variety over an aﬃne variety equipped with an
ample linearization.
In that way Theorem 1.1.2 complements [HL15, Theorem
2.10] (and similar results in [BFK12, DS14]) which constructs a semi-orthogonal
decomposition of D(X/G) in which one of the parts is D(X ss/G).

1.2. The linear case. The proof of Theorem 1.1.2 will be reduced ultimately to
the case that G is connected and X is a representation. In this section we give a
more precise description of the semi-orthogonal decomposition in this case.

We ﬁrst need to introduce more notation. Let T ⊂ B be a maximal torus and a
Borel subgroup in G. Let X(T ) and Y (T ) = X(T )∨ be respectively the character
group of T and the group of one-parameter subgroups of T . Let the roots of B be
the negative roots and let X(T )±, Y (T )± be the (anti-)dominant cones in X(T )
and Y (T ). Let ¯ρ ∈ X(T )R be half the sum of the positive roots.

Let W be a ﬁnite dimensional G-representation of dimension d such that X =
i=1 ∈ X(T ) be the T -weights of W . For

W ∨ and let R = k[X] = Sym(W ). Let (βi)d
λ ∈ Y (T )− deﬁne the following subsets of X(T )R

such that hλ, βii 6= 0. We further denote (see also §3.6 below):
λ(t)gλ(t)−1 exists },

Gλ,+ = {g ∈ G | lim
t→0
Gλ = {g ∈ G | lim
t→0

λ(t)gλ(t)−1 = g}.

(Note that Gλ = Gλ,+/rad Gλ,+ is the reductive Levi factor of Gλ,+ containing
T .) Let W = N (T )/T be the Weyl group of G, and let WGλ ⊂ W be the Weyl
group of Gλ. We write ¯ρλ ∈ X(T )R for half the sum the positive roots of Gλ
and X(T )λ for the Gλ-dominant weights inside X(T ). For χ ∈ X(T )λ we write
VGλ(χ) = IndGλ
Gλ∩B χ. I.e VGλ(λ) is the irreducible Gλ-representation with highest
weight χ (or sometimes also a Gλ,+-representation with the unipotent radical acting
trivially). Note that Gλ acts on Wλ (when we consider it as Gλ,+ representation
we let rad Gλ,+ act trivially). For a WGλ-invariant ν ∈ X(T )R we put

Lr,λ,ν = X(T )λ ∩ (ν − ¯ρλ + rΣ0

λ),

Ur,λ,ν = Mµ∈Lr,λ,ν

VGλ (µ),

Λr,λ,ν = (End(Ur,λ,ν ) ⊗ Sym(Wλ))Gλ

.

Proposition 1.2.1. [ˇSVdB15, Theorem 1.4.1] Assume r ≥ 1. Then one has
gl dim Λr,λ,ν < ∞.
Proof. As ν is WGλ-invariant, this follows from [ˇSVdB15, Theorem 1.4.1] in the
case Σ0
λ ( Σλ. (To replace Σ
in [ˇSVdB15, Theorem 1.4.1] with Σ0 one only needs to show that Hom(PL, Pχ) = 0
if χ 6∈ Γ0, and this follows by the same proof as [ˇSVdB15, Lemma 11.3.1].) To
replace Σ0
(cid:3)

λ = Σλ. It is easy to modify the proof to hold also if Σ0

λ by rΣ0

λ is also easy.

We say that x ∈ X is T -stable if x has ﬁnite stabilizer and closed T -orbit. In
the case X = Spec W the existence of a T -stable point is equivalent to the cone
spanned by the weights (βi)i of W being equal ot X(T )R.

Proposition 1.2.2. Let D = D(X/G) and assume that X has a T -stable point.
Then there exist ri ≥ 1, λi ∈ Y (T )− and WGλi -invariant νi ∈ X(T )R such that
D = h. . . , D−2, D−1, D0i, D−i ∼= D(Λri,λi,νi ), is a semi-orthogonal decomposition
of D. Moreover we may assume D0 ∼= D(Λ1,0,0).

Remark 1.2.3. The reader will note that (under suitable genericity conditions) Λ1,0,0
is the non-commutative resolution of X//G constructed in [ˇSVdB15, Cor. 1.5.2].

Remark 1.2.4. If W is “quasi-symmetric” (the sum of the weights of W on each
line through the origin is zero) then it is shown in [ˇSVdB15, §1.6] that by replac-
ing Σ by a polygon of roughly half the size one obtains smaller non-commutative
resolutions for X//G. Under favourable conditions one may even obtain so-called
non-commutative crepant resolutions (NCCRs) in this way (see also [HLS16] where,
again under appropriate conditions, it is shown that these NCCRs are of geometric
origin in the sense that they are derived equivalent to suitable X ss/G). Like-
wise if W is quasi-symmetric one may obtain a corresponding more reﬁned semi-
orthogonal decomposition of D(X/G). The details, which are combinatorial, will
be described in a subsequent publication.

Remark 1.2.5. In Proposition 1.2.2 we assume that X has a T -stable point. This
hypothesis is not very restrictive in view of §7 below. Roughly speaking if X does
not have a T -stable point then one may easily obtain a semi-orthogonal decompo-
sition of D(X/G) involving a set of D(X ′/G′) such that X ′ has a T ′-stable point
for T ′ a maximal torus of G′.

3. Preliminaries

3.1. Strongly ´etale morphisms. Let G be reductive group.
If G acts on an
aﬃne k-scheme X then we put X//G = Spec k[X]G. This is a special case of a “good
quotient” (see §3.3 below). Let f : X → Y be a G-equivariant morphism between
aﬃne G-schemes. Following [Lun73][MFK94, App. D] we say that f is strongly
´etale if X//G → Y //G is ´etale and the induced morphism X → Y ×Y //G X//G is an
isomorphism. This implies in particular that X → Y is ´etale.

Lemma 3.1.1. Assume that f : X → Y is a strongly ´etale G-equivariant morphism
of aﬃne schemes and let H be a reductive subgroup of G. Then f is strongly ´etale
as H-equivariant morphism.

Proof. From the fact that H is reductive we easily obtain

k[X]H = (k[Y ] ⊗k[Y ]G k[X]G)H = k[Y ]H ⊗k[Y ]G k[X]G.

Thus
k[Y ] ⊗k[Y ]H k[X]H = k[Y ] ⊗k[Y ]H k[Y ]H ⊗k[Y ]G k[X]G = k[Y ] ⊗k[Y ]G k[X]G = k[X].
(cid:3)

3.2. The Bialinicky-Birula decomposition in the aﬃne case. We use [Dri13]
as a reference for some facts about the Bialinicky-Birula decomposition [BB73].
Let R be a commutative k-algebra equipped with a rational Gm-action λ : Gm →

Autk(R). This Gm-action induces a grading on Ln Rn on R where z ∈ Gm acts

on r ∈ Rn by z · r = znr. Let I +, I − be the ideals in R respectively generated by
(Rn)n>0 and (Rn)n<0 and put I = I + + I −. We deﬁne Rλ := R/I. Rλ,± := R/I ±.
Note

(Rλ,±)0 = Rλ.

(3.1)
If X = Spec R then we also write X λ = Spec Rλ, X λ,± = Spec Rλ,±. It follows
from [Dri13, §1.3.4] that X λ is the subscheme of ﬁxed points of X and X λ,+, X λ,−
are respectively the attractor and repeller subschemes of X. According to [Dri13,
Prop 1.4.20], X λ, X λ,± are smooth if this is the case for X.

Lemma 3.2.1. Assume that f : X → Y is a strongly ´etale Gm-equivariant mor-
phism of aﬃne schemes, with the action denoted by λ. Then

X λ = X ×Y Y λ

X λ,+ = X ×Y Y λ,+
X λ,− = X ×Y Y λ,− .

SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT STACKS

Proof. We have

k[X] = k[Y ] ⊗k[Y ]Gm k[X]Gm

and this isomorphism is clearly compatible with the grading on both sides. Thus

k[X]n = k[Y ]n ⊗k[Y ]0 k[X]0.

The lemma now follows easily from the deﬁnitions.

(cid:3)

3.3. The Bialinicky-Birula decomposition when there is a good quotient.
We use the following deﬁnition from [Bri09] (see the discussion after Prop. 1.29 in
loc. cit.).

Deﬁnition 3.3.1. Let G be a reductive group and let π : X → Y be a G-equivariant
morphism of k-schemes. Then π is a good quotient if the following holds

(1) π is aﬃne.
(2) OY = (π∗OX )G.

It is easy to see that a good quotient is unique, if it exists. Therefore following
tradition we will usually write Y = X//G. We have already used this notation in
the case that X is aﬃne. Note the following

Lemma 3.3.2. Assume that G is a reductive group acting on a k-scheme X such
that X//G exists. Let H be a reductive subgroup of G. Then X//H also exists.

Proof. Let π : X → X//G be the good quotient. It is easy to verify that X//H =
Spec(π∗OX )H .
(cid:3)

Assume now that X is a k-scheme on which Gm acts via λ : Gm → Aut(X).
Assume that a good quotient π : X → X//Gm exists. If U ⊂ X//Gm is an open aﬃne
subvariety then we may deﬁne closed subvarieties π−1(U )λ, π−1(U )λ,± of π−1(U )
as in §3.2 and according to Lemma 3.2.1 these are compatible with restrictions for
U ′ ⊂ U . Hence we may glue these closed subvarieties to obtain X λ, X λ,± ⊂ X.
One may verify that X λ, X λ,± are still the ﬁxed points and the attractor/repeller
subschemes for λ.

3.4. Good quotients and geometric invariant theory. One way to obtain
good quotients is via the machinery of geometric invariant theory [MFK94]. Let
G be a reductive group and let X be a G-equivariant k-scheme which is projective
over an aﬃne scheme, equipped with a G-equivariant ample line bundle M.
If
f ∈ Γ(X, M⊗n)G, n > 0 then Xf := {f 6= 0} ⊂ X is aﬃne and G-equivariant.

of X which has a good quotient X ss//G which may be obtained by gluing Xf //G =
Spec k[Xf ]G for varying f . Another way to obtain X ss//G is as follows: let Γ∗(X) =

The semi-stable locus in X is deﬁned as X ss =Sf Xf . This is an open subvariety
Ln Γ(X, M⊗n). Then X ss//G = Proj Γ∗(X)G.

The following result, which we will not use, gives an alternative description of

X ss,λ, X ss,λ,± in the GIT setting.

Proposition 3.4.1. Let G be a reductive group and let X be a G-equivariant
k-scheme which is projective over an aﬃne scheme. Let M ∈ Pic(X) be a G-
equivariant ample line bundle X and let X ss ⊂ X be the corresponding semi-stable
locus.

Let R = Γ∗(X) and let λ be a one-parameter subgroup of G. Then λ acts on R
in a way which is compatible with the grading and X ss,λ, X ss,λ,± are the closed
subschemes of X ss deﬁned by the (graded) quotient rings Rλ, Rλ,± of R (see §3.2).

Proof. We will give the proof for X ss,λ,+. The proofs for X ss,λ and X ss,λ,− are
n , n > 0 we have Xf = Spec(Rf )0. By construction X ss,λ,+ ∩
similar. For f ∈ RG
Xf = (Xf )λ,+. We have to prove that (Xf )λ,+ = Spec((Rλ,+)f )0. Since we
have (Xf )λ,+ = Spec((Rf )0)λ,+ this amounts to showing ((Rλ,+)f )0 = ((Rf )0)λ,+.
By Lemma 3.2.1 we have (Rλ,+)f = (Rf )λ,+. So ultimately we have to show
(T λ,+)0 = (T0)λ,+ for T = Rf . Since M is ample, T is strongly graded (i.e.
TaTb = Ta+b for a, b ∈ Z) and then it is suﬃcient to invoke Lemma 3.4.2 below. (cid:3)

Lemma 3.4.2. Assume that T is Z-graded strongly graded commutative k-algebra
with a unit f ∈ Tn, n > 0. Assume that T is in addition equipped with a Gm-action
λ : Gm → Aut(T ) which is compatible with the grading such that f is Gm-invariant.
Then we have (T λ)0 = (T0)λ and (T λ,±)0 = (T0)λ,±.
Proof. We give the proof for T λ,+. We turn the Gm-action on T into a bigrading.

I.e. T =Ln,α∈Z2 Tnα with the Gm action on Tnα being given by z · t = zαt.

We have

Thus we have to show that T−m,αTm,β for β > 0 is contained inPγ,δ∈Z,δ>0 T0,γT0,δ.

We may do this locally on Spec T00. So now we assume that T00 is local. By Lemma
3.4.3 below this implies that T0 is graded local and since T1 is an invertible graded
T0-module it is graded free. In other words T ∼= T0[t, t−1] where deg(t) = (1, σ) for
suitable σ ∈ Z.

By hypothesis Tn0 contains a unit f . Write f = htn. Then h ∈ T0,−nσ is a unit
in T0. If σ 6= 0 then it is easy to see that (T0)λ,+ = 0 and there is nothing to prove.
So assume σ = 0. In that case we have T−m,αTm,β = T0,αT0,β and we are also
done.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.4.3. Let S be a Z-graded commutative ring such that S0 is local. Then S
is graded local.

Proof. We have to show that the homogoneous non-units form a graded ideal. Let
x, y ∈ St be non-units. This implies xS−t ⊂ m, yS−t ⊂ m where m is the maximal
ideal of S0. But then also (x + y)S−t ⊂ m. So x + y is not a unit.
(cid:3)

3.5. Good quotients and local generation. Let X be a quasi-compact, quasi-
separated G-scheme for a reductive group G such that a good quotient π : X →
X//G exists. It is easy to see that then X//G is quasi-compact and quasi-separated
as well. Below we write πs : X/G → X//G for the corresponding stack morphism.
Note that both π∗ and πs∗ are exact.

We recall some properties of DQch(X/G).

Theorem 3.5.1.

(1) DQch(X/G) is compactly generated.

(2) An object in DQch(X/G) is compact if and only if it is perfect. I.e. if and

only if its image in D(X) is perfect.

(3) If X is separated then DQch(X/G) = D(Qch(X/G)).

Proof. (1) follows from [HR14, Thm B]. It also follows from this result and the
proof of [Nee92, Lemma 2.2] that every compact object is perfect. On the other

SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT STACKS

7

hand it is easy to see that in this case every perfect object is compact. This proves
(2). Finally (3) follows from [HNR14, Thm 1.2].
(cid:3)

For an open U ⊂ X//G we write ˜U = U ×X//G X ⊂ X.

Deﬁnition 3.5.2. Let (Ei)i∈I be a collection of perfect objects in DQch(X/G).
The subcategory of DQch(X/G) locally generated by (Ei)i∈I is the full subcategory
of DQch(X/G) spanned by all objects F such that for every aﬃne open U ⊂ X//G
we have that F| ˜U is in the smallest thick subcategory of DQch( ˜U /G) containing
(Ei| ˜U )i.

Let us say that F, G ∈ DQch(X/G) are locally isomorphic if there exists a cov-

ering X//G = Si∈I Ui such that F | ˜Ui ∼= G| ˜Ui for all i. It is convenient to call a

subcategory of DQch(X/G) locally closed if it is closed under local isomorphism. A
triangulated subcategory of Perf(X/G) is locally closed if and only if it is locally
generated by itself.

let F ∈ Perf(X/G). Let X//G =Sn

Lemma 3.5.3. Let (Ei)i∈I be a collection of perfect objects in DQch(X/G) and
j=1 Uj be a ﬁnite open aﬃne covering of X//G.
If for all j one has that F| ˜Uj is in the smallest thick subcategory of DQch( ˜Uj/G)
containing (Ei| ˜Uj)i then F is in the subcategory of DQch(X/G) locally generated by
(Ei)i∈I .
Proof. Let U ⊂ X//G be an aﬃne open. We have to show that F| ˜U is in the
smallest thick subcategory of DQch( ˜U /G) containing by (Ei| ˜U )i∈I . By replacing

X//G by U and reﬁning the cover U =Sj∈I U ∩Uj to an aﬃne one we reduce to the

case that X//G is itself aﬃne. In particular by Theorem 3.5.1(3) DQch(X/G) is the
derived category of G-equivariant k[X]-modules. The aﬃne Uj yield G-equivariant
ﬂat extensions k[ ˜Uj] of k[X].

Let E be the cocomplete triangulated subcategory of DQch(X/G) generated by
(Ei)i∈I and similarly let Ej ⊆ DQch( ˜Uj/G) be generated by (Ei| ˜Uj)i∈I Then there
is a unique distinguished triangle

F0 → F → F1 →

where F0 ∈ E and F1 ∈ E ⊥. Since Uj is aﬃne it is easy to see that F1| ˜Uj ∈ E ⊥
j .
But by hypothesis F| ˜Uj ∈ Ej and thus F1| ˜Uj = 0. Since this is true for all j we
conclude F1 = 0 and hence F ∈ E. Since F is compact the conclusion follows from
[Nee92, Lemma 2.2].
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.5.4. The category Perf(X/G) is locally generated by (V ⊗kOX )V where V
runs through the irreducible representations of G.

Proof. We may assume that X is aﬃne and then it is clear.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.5.5. Assume that D ⊂ DQch(X/G) is locally generated by the perfect
complex E and let Λ = πs∗ REnd X/G(E) (a sheaf of DG-algebras on X//G). The
functors

D → Perf(Λ) : F 7→ πs∗ RHom X/G(E, F )

Perf(Λ) → D : H 7→ H

L
⊗Λ E

(the second functor is computed starting from a K-ﬂat resolution of H) yield inverse
equivalences between D and Perf(Λ).

8

ˇSPELA ˇSPENKO AND MICHEL VAN DEN BERGH

Proof. The two functors are adjoint functors between DQch(X/G) and D(Λ). The
fact that they deﬁne functors between D and Perf(Λ) can be checked locally. The
fact that the unit and counit are invertible can also be checked locally.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.5.6. Note that if U ⊂ X//G is aﬃne then Λ|U is the sheaf of DG-algebras
associated to the DG-algebra REnd ˜U /G(E). We will use this routinely below.
Lemma 3.5.7. Assume that X is a smooth k-scheme. Let E ∈ D(X/G).
If
Λ = πs∗ REnd X/G(E) is a sheaf of algebras of ﬁnite global dimension when restricted
to aﬃne opens in X//G then the induced fully faithful functor (see Lemma 3.5.5)

I : D(Λ) → D(X/G) : H 7→ H

L
⊗Λ E

is admissible (i.e. it has a left and a right adjoint).

Proof. The right adjoint to I is given πs∗ RHom X/G(E, −). To construct the left
adjoint note that there is a duality D(Λ◦) → D(Λ) given by (−)∨ := RHom Λ(−, Λ).
One checks that the left adjoint to I is given by πs∗ RHom X/G(−, E)∨.
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.5.8. Let I be a totally ordered set. Assume D ⊂ Perf(X/G) is
locally generated by a collection of locally closed subcategories Di ∈ Perf(X/G).
Assume πs∗ RHom X/G(Di, Dj) = 0 for i > j. Then D is generated by (Di)i and in
particular we have a semi-orthogonal decomposition D = hDi | i ∈ Ii.

Proof. It is clear that we may ﬁrst reduce to the case that I ﬁnite and then to
|I| = 2. Hence we assume I = {1, 2}.
In the same vein we may reduce to the
case that the Di are locally generated by single perfect complexes (Ei)i=1,2. Put
Λi = πs∗ End X/G(Ei).

Let F ∈ D. Put F2 = πs∗ RHom X/G(E2, F )

L
⊗Λ2 E2 ∈ D2 and F1 = cone(F2 →
F ). Then πs∗ RHom X/G(E2, F1) = 0. If U ⊂ X//G is aﬃne then F | ˜U is in the
thick subcategory of Perf( ˜U /G) generated by E1| ˜U , E2| ˜U . It follows that F1| ˜U is
in the thick subcategory of Perf( ˜U /G) generated by E1| ˜U . Since this is true for all
U we conclude that F1 ∈ D1. Hence D is generated by D1, D2.

3.6. The Bialinicky-Birula decomposition for reductive algebraic groups.
We recall the following.

Proposition 3.6.1. [Spr98, Proposition 8.4.5, Exercise 8.4.6(5), Theorem 13.4.2]
Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group and let λ : Gm → G be a one-
parameter subgroup of G. Then Gλ, Gλ,± are connected subgroups of G. Moreover
the Gλ,± are parabolic subgroups of G and Gλ is the Levi-subgroup of Gλ,±.

We recall the following.

Lemma 3.6.2. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group with T ⊂ B ⊂
G being a maximal torus and a Borel subgroup of G. Let λ ∈ Y (T )− and χ ∈
X(T )+ and let V (χ) be the irreducible G-representation with highest weight χ. Then
ResG

Gλ V (χ) = VGλ(χ) ⊕Li VGλ(µi) with hλ, µii > hλ, χi.

Proof. This is similar to the proof that χ occurs with multiplicity one among the
weights of V (χ) [Jan87, Proposition 2.4]. All the weights µ of V (χ) satisfy hλ, µi ≥
hλ, χi. Hence we have a decomposition V (χ) = V (χ)λ ⊕ V (χ)+ where V (χ)+ is the
span of the weight vectors with weights µ such that hλ, µi > hλ, χi. It is clear that
this is a decomposition as Gλ-modules. If V (χ)λ is decomposable then it is easy

SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT STACKS

to see that its indecomposable summands generate distinct G-subrepresentations
of V (χ) which is impossible.

Since V (χ)λ contains the weight vector with weight χ we must have V (χ)λ =
(cid:3)

VGλ(χ).

3.7. The G/Ge-action on weights. Let G be a reductive group such that T ⊂
B ⊂ Ge are respectively a maximal torus and a Borel subgroup of Ge.

Let g ∈ G and σg = g · g−1 ∈ Aut(Ge). Then σg(T ) ⊂ σg(B) are respectively
a maximal torus and a Borel subgroup of Ge. Thus there exists g0 ∈ Ge such that
g0σg(T )g−1

0 = T , g0σg(B)g−1

0 = B.

In the sequel if ¯g ∈ G/Ge then we write σ¯g ∈ Aut(Ge) for σg0g where g0g is
an element of the coset ¯g such that σg0g preserves (T, B). Since g0 is unique up
to multiplication by an element of T , σ¯g is well deﬁned up to conjugation by an
element of T . Since σ¯g preserves (T, B) it yields a well deﬁned action on X(T ) via
χ 7→ χ ◦ σ¯g which preserves X(T )R and X(T )+. We will write ¯g(χ) for χ ◦ σ−1
¯g .
There is also an action of G/Ge on Y (T ) given by λ 7→ σ¯g ◦ λ. Finally we have

hλ, χ ◦ σ¯gi = hσ¯g ◦ λ, χi.

If λ ∈ Y (T ) then we will write (G/Ge)λ ⊂ G/Ge for the stabilizer of λ under the
G/Ge-action on Y (T ). Let ˜Gλ be the inverse image of (G/Ge)λ in G. There is an
e . We will write ¯Gλ for the (open)
obvious inclusion (G/Ge)λ ⊂ GeGλ/Ge = Gλ/Gλ
e = (G/Ge)λ. So ˜Gλ/Ge = ¯Gλ/Gλ

4. Reduction settings

Now we introduce our main technical tool to obtain semi-orthogonal decompo-

sitions of D(X/G).

4.1. Deﬁnition. Let G be a reductive group such that T ⊂ B ⊂ Ge are respectively
a maximal torus and a Borel subgroup of Ge

Below we consider the situation where G acts on a variety X. In that case we

also put for χ ∈ X(T )+

Pχ = VG(χ) ⊗k OX ∈ coh(X/G).

To indicate context we may also write PG,χ, PG,X,χ, etc. . . . If L ⊂ X(T )+ then

we put PL = Lχ∈L Pχ. We make the following deﬁnition (using some notation

introduced in §1.2).

Deﬁnition 4.1.1. A reduction setting is a tuple (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) with the fol-
lowing properties:

(1) G is a reductive group and T ⊂ B ⊂ Ge are respectively a maximal torus

and a Borel subgroup of G.

(2) χ ∈ X(T )+.

10

(3) λ ∈ Y (T )−.
(4) L is a ﬁnite subset of X(T )+ invariant under G/Ge.
(5) If µ ∈ L then hλ, χi < hλ, µi.
(6) X is a smooth G-equivariant k-scheme such that a good quotient π : X →

X//G exists (with associated stack morphism πs : X/G → X//G).

(7) We will show in Lemma 4.1.2 below that (5) implies

The following lemma was necessary to complete Deﬁnition 4.1.1.

Lemma 4.1.2. Assume that L is as in Deﬁnition 4.1.1(5). Then (4.1) holds.

Proof. By using an aﬃne covering of X//G we may assume that X is aﬃne. By
adjointness we have

By the G/Ge-invariance of L, the simple summands of (ResG

are precisely the (VGe (µ))µ∈L (see (3.2, 3.3)). In other words it suﬃces to prove
that for every µ such that hλ, µi > hλ, χi one has

Using the fact that the weights µ of k[X λ,+] all satisfy hλ, µi ≤ 0 (see §3.2)
we conclude as in the proof of [ˇSVdB15, Lemma 11.2.1] that the cohomology of
RIndGe
B (χ ⊗k k[X λ,+]) are direct sums of VGe (µ) with hλ, µi ≤ hλ, χi. This ﬁnishes
the proof.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.1.3. Assume that X is aﬃne. It is easy to see that (4.3) is an isomorphism
if and only if there is a complex P • in coh(X/G) concentrated in degrees ≤ 0 with
P i being a direct sum of PG,µ, µ ∈ L together with a morphism P • → PG,χ and a
quasi-isomorphism

after composing with PG,χ → cone(P • → PG,χ).

From this remark we obtain the following convenient fact:

Proposition 4.1.4. Assume that G is a reductive group acting on an aﬃne variety
X. If (Ge, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) is a reduction setting then so is (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ).

Proof. We only have to verify (4.3) and to do so we may assume that X is aﬃne.
Assume that we have a complex and an isomorphism like (4.6) for G = Ge. Then
applying the exact functor IndG
(cid:3)

Ge yields what we want.

Note also the following

Proposition 4.1.5. Assume that (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) is a reduction setting. Then

(4.7)

Ri IndG

Gλ,+

e

(VGλ

e

(χ) ⊗ j∗OX λ,+ ) = 0

for i > 0.

Proof. We assume that X is aﬃne. Replacing HomG,X(PG,L, PG,χ) in (4.3) by its
projective resolution over EndG,X (PG,L), it follows that there is a nonzero coho-
mology only in negative degree.
(cid:3)

4.2. Reduction to closed subschemes. We will create reduction settings ﬁrst in
the linear case (X being a representation) and then we will restrict them to closed
subschemes. To do this will use the following theorem:

Theorem 4.2.1. Let G be a reductive group and let Y ⊂ X be a closed embed-
ding of smooth G-varieties. If (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) is a reduction setting then so is
(G, B, T, Y, L, χ, λ).

To prove this we may assume that X is aﬃne. We ﬁrst discuss a special case.

Lemma 4.2.2. Assume that (G, X, Y ) are as in the statement of Theorem 4.2.1
but with X aﬃne. Assume in addition that there is a Gm-action on X in a way
which commutes with the G-action such that k[X] has only weights ≥ 0 and1 k[Y ] =
k[X]Gm. Then the conclusion of Theorem 4.2.1 holds.

Proof. Assume that (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) is a reduction setting. Then there exist a
resolution

(4.8)

cone(P •

X → PG,X,χ) → RIndG

Gλ,+

e

(VGλ

e

(χ) ⊗ k[X λ,+])

as in (4.6) (we have switched to coordinate ring notation). Moreover we may assume
that this resolution is Gm-equivariant. In addition since k[X λ,+] is a quotient of
k[X] it only has Gm-weights ≥ 0 and this property is not aﬀected by applying
RIndG
(χ) ⊗ −). We conclude that as G × Gm-equivariant k[X]-module
P n
X may be assumed to be a direct sum of PG,X,µ ⊗ σn, n ≥ 0 where σn is the
Gm-character z 7→ zn and µ ∈ L. We then have

(VGλ

Gλ,+

e

e

(PG,X,µ ⊗ σn)Gm =(PG,Y,µ

if n > 0

1If the Gm-action is denoted by γ then this condition may also be written as Y = X γ ,

X = X γ,−.

12

Taking Gm-invariants of (4.8) we now get a similar resolution

cone(P •

Y → P •

G,Y,χ) → RIndG

Gλ,+

e

(VGλ

e

(χ) ⊗ k[X λ,+])Gm.

Furthermore since the G and Gm-action do not interfere with each other we have

(VGλ

e

(χ) ⊗ k[X λ,+])Gm = RIndG

Gλ,+

e

(VGλ

(χ) ⊗ k[X λ,+]Gm)

and ﬁnally using the description of k[X λ,+] in §3.2 we easily see that k[X λ,+]Gm =
k[Y λ,+]. This ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

We will now reduce the proof of Theorem 4.2.1 to the special case considered in

Lemma 4.2.2 using the Luna slice theorem.

Lemma 4.2.3. Let G be a linear algebraic group acting on an aﬃne variety X and
let P ∈ DQch(X/G). Assume that P is zero in the neighborhood of any point with
closed orbit. I.e. any x ∈ X such that Gx is closed has an open neighborhood Ux
such that P |Ux = 0. Then P = 0.

Proof. Put U ′ =Sx Ux and U = GU ′. Then P |U = 0 so it is suﬃcient to prove

U = X. Assume this is not the case. Since X − U is closed and G-invariant it
contains a closed orbit (e.g. an orbit of minimal dimension). This is an obvious
contradiction.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2.4. If (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) is such that the conditions (1-6) from Def-
inition 4.1.1 hold, and such that X is aﬃne, then write CX for the cone of (4.3).
If α : Z → X is a strongly ´etale G-equivariant morphism then α∗(CX ) = CZ .
Proof. This ultimately boils down to α∗OX λ,+ = OZλ,+ which is true thanks to
Lemma 3.2.1.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 4.2.1. We assume that (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) is a reduction setting
and X is aﬃne. Thus CX = 0 and we have to deduce from it CY = 0. According
to Lemma 4.2.3 it suﬃces to do this in the neighborhood of any closed orbit. So
let Gy be a closed orbit in Y and let NY be a Gy-invariant complement to Ty(Gy)
in Ty(Y ). Then according to the Luna slice theorem [Lun73] there is an aﬃne
Gy-invariant “slice” y ∈ S ⊂ Y to the orbit of y and strongly Gy-equivariant ´etale
morphism S → NY which sends y to 0 such that the induced maps

Y

α←− G ×Gy S

β
−→ G ×Gy NY

are strongly ´etale. Then by Lemma 4.2.4 we have α∗(CY ) = β∗(CG×Gy NY ). Thus
it is suﬃcient to prove that CG×Gy NY = 0.

By assumption Gy is closed in X. Let V be a Gy-invariant complement to Ty(Y )
in Ty(X) and put NX := NY ⊕ V . By assumption Gy is closed in X and hence by
the same reasoning as above we conclude that CG×Gy NX is zero in a neighborhood of
the zero section of G ×Gy NX → G/Gy. However note that CG×Gy NX is equivariant
for the scalar Gm-action on NX . So in fact CG×Gy NX = 0.

Now let Gm-act on NX = NY ⊕ V by acting trivially on NY and with weight −1
on V . Then the inclusion G×Gy NY ֒→ G×Gy NX falls under the setting considered
in Lemma 4.2.2. We conclude from this lemma that CG×Gy NY = 0, ﬁnishing the
proof.

4.3. Reduction settings and RHom. We will prove the following result

Lemma 4.3.1. Assume that we have a reduction setting (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) and
assume χ′ ∈ X(T )+ is such that hλ, χi = hλ, χ′i and hλ, ¯g(χ′)i > hλ, χi for all
¯g 6∈ (G/Ge)λ. Let iλ : X λ// ¯Gλ → X//G be induced from X λ → X. It is clear that
iλ is aﬃne so iλ∗ is exact. Let πs,λ be the canonical map X λ/ ¯Gλ → X λ// ¯Gλ.

We have isomorphisms

(4.9) πs∗ RHom X/G(RIndG

Moreover such isomorphisms are compatible with composition when applicable.

Proof. The righthand side of (4.9) only has cohomology in degree zero. Hence it is
suﬃcient to construct an isomorphism like (4.9) in the aﬃne case, in a way which
is compatible with restriction. So we now assume X is aﬃne. Using (4.1) and (4.3)
and some applications of adjointness we have to construct an isomorphism

4.4. Reduction settings in the connected linear case. We use the notation
and conventions introduced in §1.2. We need the twisted Weyl group action of W
on X(T ): w∗χ := w(χ + ¯ρ) − ¯ρ.
If χ ∈ X(T ) and there is some w∗χ which is
dominant then we write χ+ = w∗χ. Otherwise χ+ is undeﬁned.

Proposition 4.4.1. Let G be a connected reductive group and assume B, T, χ, λ, L
satisfy (1)-(5) in Deﬁnition 4.1.1. Let X = W ∨ where W is a G-representation with
weights β1, . . . , βd. Assume (χ + βi1 + · · · + βi−p )+ ∈ L for all ∅ 6= {i1, . . . , i−p} ⊆
{1, . . . , d}, ij 6= ij′ for j 6= j′. Then (G, B, T, X, L, χ, λ) is a reduction setting.

Proof. We only have to verify (4.3). We denote by Kλ the subspace of W spanned
by the weight vectors wj such that hλ, βji > 0. Note that Spec Sym(W/Kλ) ∼=
X λ,+. In [ˇSVdB15, (11.3)] we constructed a quasi-isomorphism

(4.12)

Cλ,χ → RIndG
where Cλ,χ is a complex of the form

Gλ,+(VGλ (χ) ⊗ k[X λ,+]),

(4.13)

Cλ,χ

def= Mp≤0,q≥0

H q(G/B, (χ ⊗k ∧−pKλ)˜) ⊗k k[X][−p − q], d .

Note that a priori Cλ,χ is not concentrated in degrees ≤ 0 (this might be true but it
would require an argument). We showed that after forgetting the diﬀerential Cλ,χ
is a sum of G-equivariant projective modules of the form Pµ where the µ are among
the weights

(4.14)

(χ + βi1 + βi2 + · · · + βi−p )+

(with each such expression occurring at most once) where {i1, . . . , i−p} ⊂ {1, . . . , d},
ij 6= ij′ for j 6= j′ and hλ, βij i > 0 [ˇSVdB15, Lemma 11.2.1]. Moreover there is a
single copy of Pχ which lives in degree zero. In is not explicitly stated in loc. cit.
but it follows easily from the construction that this copy of Pχ yields an inclusion
Pχ → Cλ,χ such that the composition Pχ → Cλ,χ → RIndG
Gλ,+ (VGλ (χ) ⊗ k[X λ,+])
is the canonical morphism exhibited in (4.2).

Let C′

λ,χ = Cλ,χ/Pχ. Then we have Cλ,χ = cone(C′

λ,χ[−1] → Pχ). Moreover
using the fact that by (4.1) we have RHomk[X](PL, Cλ,χ)G = 0 and the fact that
by hypothesis the summands Pµ of C′

λ,χ are summands of PL we ﬁnd

C′

λ,χ = RHomk[X](PL, C′

λ,χ)G

∼= RHomk[X](PL, Pχ[1])G

L
⊗REndk[X](PL)G PL
L
⊗REndk[X](PL)G PL.

SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT STACKS

15

Hence C′
λ,χ lives in degrees ≤ −1. So we deduce that Cλ,χ is quasi-isomorphic to a
complex of the form cone(P • → Pχ) as in Remark 4.1.3. So (4.3) holds and we are
done.
(cid:3)

5. Partitioning X(T )+

5.1. Preliminaries. We assume we are in the setting of §1.2. In particular G is
connected and acts on a representation X = W ∨. We now introduce some extra
notation. We let Φ ⊂ X(T ) be the roots of G. We write Φ− for the negative
roots of G (the roots of B) and Φ+ for the positive roots. We choose a positive
deﬁnite W-invariant quadratic form (−, −) on X(T )R. If α ∈ Φ then ˇα ∈ Y (T )R
is the corresponding coroot deﬁned by hˇα, χi = 2(α, χ)/(α, α) and the associated
reﬂection on X(T )R is deﬁned by sα(χ) = χ − hˇα, χiα. We put Φ∨ = { ˇα | α ∈ Φ}.
λ = Φ+ ∩ Φλ the set of

We set Φλ = {α ∈ Φ | hλ, αi = 0}. We denote by Φ+

positive roots of Gλ.

Let us recall a slightly extended version of [ˇSVdB15, Corollary D.3.] with the

same proof.
Lemma 5.1.1. Let λ ∈ Y (T )−
Then hλ, w∗χi ≤ hλ, χi with equality if and only if w ∈ WGλ.
Proof. When comparing with [ˇSVdB15, Corollary D.3.] note that in loc. cit. the
role of λ is played by y, which is assumed to be dominant, rather than anti-dominant
which is the case here. So the inequalities are reversed.

R , w ∈ W, χ ∈ X(T ) such that w∗χ is dominant.

Since χ+ := w∗χ is dominant we have χ+ = sαn∗ · · · ∗sα1 ∗χ such that for each

χi := sαi∗ · · · ∗sα1 ∗χ the inequality hˇαi+1, χii ≤ −2 holds.

In loc. cit. it is shown that hλ, w∗χi ≤ hλ, χi. Going through the proof we see
that the only possibility for equality to occur is when hλ, αii = 0 for all i. But
then w′ := sαn · · · sα1 ∈ WGλ. Since χ+ is dominant it has trivial stabilizer for the
∗-action. Since (ww′−1) ∗ χ+ = χ+ we conclude w = w′ ∈ WGλ.
(cid:3)

We will also need the following variant

Lemma 5.1.2. Let λ ∈ Y (T )−
Then hλ, wχi ≤ hλ, χi with equality if and only if wχ ∈ WGλχ.

R , w ∈ W, χ ∈ X(T ) such that wχ is dominant.

Proof. The proofs is along the same lines as the proof of Lemma 5.1.1 except
that wχ may have non-trivial stabilizer. This accounts for the slightly weaker
conclusion.
(cid:3)

We deﬁne

T +
λ = {i | hλ, βii > 0}, T 0

λ = {i | hλ, βii = 0}, T −

λ = {i | hλ, βii < 0}.

A point x ∈ X is stable if it has closed orbit and ﬁnite stabilizer. X has a T -stable
point if and only if for every λ ∈ Y (T ) \ {0} there exists i such that hλ, βii > 0
(i.e., not all the weights lie in a half space deﬁned by the hyperplane through the
origin).

In the rest of this section we assume that X = W ∨ has a T -stable point.

16

ˇSPELA ˇSPENKO AND MICHEL VAN DEN BERGH

5.2. Expression of χ in terms of faces of Σ. As X has a T -stable point, 0 lies in

the interior of the positive span of (βi)i and in particular − ¯ρ+Sr rΣ = X(T )R, thus

every − ¯ρ 6= χ ∈ X(T ) lies either in the relative interior of a unique proper face of
− ¯ρ+rΣ for a unique r > 0. We will partition the set X(T )+ according to the relative
interiors of faces of − ¯ρ + rΣ to which its elements belong. However for convenience
we will not use the faces directly but rather some equivalent combinatorial data
associated to them.

For a set S let P(S) be its power set. We put a partial ordering ≺ on R+ ×
P({1, . . . , d})3 by declaring (r, S+, S−, S0) (cid:22) (r′, S′+, S′−, S′0) if either r < r′ or
else r = r′, S+ ⊂ S′+ and S− ⊂ S′−.

Let R+ × N3 be equipped with the (total) lexicographic ordering. There is an

order preserving map

(5.1)

(R+ × P({1, . . . , d})3, ≺) → (R+ × N3, <) : (r, S) 7→ (r, |S|)

whose ﬁbers are incomparable among each other.

Lemma-Deﬁnition 5.2.1.

(1) For − ¯ρ 6= χ ∈ X(T ) there exists an expression

of the form

(5.2)

χ = − ¯ρ − r Xi∈S+

βi + 0 Xi∈S−

βi +Xi∈S0

biβi,

where r > 0, −r < bi < 0, and S+, S−, S0 form a partition of {1, . . . , d}.
There is the unique tuple (rχ, Sχ) := (rχ, S+
χ), for which (rχ, |Sχ|)
is minimal among tuples attached to any such expression. If χ = − ¯ρ then
we put by convention rχ = 0, S+
χ = ∅ (although (5.2) is then not
true). Below we refer to this situation as the “trivial case”.

χ = S−

R with the properties: S−

λ .

Remark 5.2.2. If χ ∈ X(T )+ then the trivial case is equivalent to G = T and χ = 0.

Remark 5.2.3. It will follow from the proof of Lemma 5.2.1 as well a Lemma 5.2.4
below that the data (rχ, Sχ) identiﬁes which proper face of − ¯ρ + rχΣ contains χ in
its relative interior. Furthermore λ as in Lemma 5.2.1(2) deﬁnes an appropriately
chosen supporting plane for that face. Finally the ≺-ordering is opposite to the
ordering given by inclusion of faces.

Proof of Lemma 5.2.1. The existence of an expression with minimal (rχ, |Sχ|) is
obvious. To prove the uniqueness of the associated tuple (rχ, Sχ) assume that
there are two minimal expressions with diﬀerent associated tuples. Taking their
average we obtain an expression which is smaller than both the original expressions,
contradicting the minimality.

We will now prove (2). If we are in the trivial case then we take λ = 0. So we will
now assume we are not in the trivial case. We take r minimal such that χ ∈ − ¯ρ+r ¯Σ
(and hence rχ = r). By [ˇSVdB15, Lemma C.2] there exists 0 6= λ ∈ Y (T )R such
that hλ, χi < hλ, µi for all µ ∈ − ¯ρ + rχΣ and χ can be written as

(5.3)

χ = − ¯ρ − rχ Xi∈T +

biβi,

−rχ < bi < 0. Thus by Lemma 5.2.4 below χ + ¯ρ is in the relative interior of the
face of rχ ¯Σ deﬁned by the supporting half plane hλ, χ + ¯ρi ≤ hλ, −i. Let w ∈ W

be such that wλ ∈ Y (T )−
(11.4)]
hwλ, χ + ¯ρi ≤ hwλ, −i is still a supporting half plane for rχ ¯Σ. It is easy to see that
the corresponding face must be equal to wF . Since the face still contains χ + ¯ρ we
must have F = wF . It follow again from Lemma 5.2.4 below that (5.3) remains
true with λ replaced by wλ. So we now assume λ ∈ Y (T )−
R .

By Observation (3) in the proof of [ˇSVdB15, Theorem 1.4.1] (applied to both
boundaries of the interval [−rχ, 0]) we ﬁnd that in any expression of the form (5.2)
λ ⊂ S+, T −

Lemma 5.2.4. χ ∈ X(T )R is in the relative interior of a face of ¯Σ deﬁned by a

with −1 < bi < 0.
Proof. Let H be the hyperplane hλ, χi = hλ, −i. Then F = H ∩ ¯Σ is given by those

µ =Pi ciβi such that hλ, χi = hλ, µi and

i ∈ T +
i ∈ T −
i ∈ T 0

λ ⇒ ci = 1,
λ ⇒ ci = 0,
λ ⇒ ci ∈ [0, 1].

This follows in fact from Observation (3) in the proof of [ˇSVdB15, Theorem 1.4.1]
(applied to both boundaries of the interval [−1, 0]). It follows that relint F is given

by those µ =Pi ciβi such that hλ, χi = hλ, µi and

i ∈ T +
i ∈ T −
i ∈ T 0

λ ⇒ ci = 1,
λ ⇒ ci = 0,
λ ⇒ ci ∈]0, 1[.

Applying this with µ = χ yields what we want.

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.2.5. Assume that λ corresponds to χ as in Lemma 5.2.1. Then the
following properties hold

(1) hλ, χi = hλ, χ′i < hλ, µi for all µ ∈ X(T )+ with (rχ, Sχ) 6(cid:22) (rµ, Sµ) and all

χ′ ∈ X(T )+ with (rχ′ , Sχ′ ) = (rχ, Sχ),

(2) the sets {βi | i ∈ S+

χ }, {βi | i ∈ S−

χ } are WGλ- invariant.

Proof. (2) is immediate since λ is stabilized by WGλ.

Now we verify (1). Again it is suﬃcient to consider the non-trivial case. The

part involving χ′ is easy so we will discuss the part involving µ. We have

λ 6= ∅ which follows from the existence of a T -stable point.

Corollary 5.2.6. Let χ ∈ X(T )+ be such that rχ ≥ 1 and let λ be as in Lemma
5.2.1(2). If p > 0 and µ = χ + βi1 + · · · + βip , where {i1, . . . , ip} ⊂ {1, . . . , d},
ij 6= ij′ for j 6= j′ and hλ, βij i > 0, then (rµ+ , |Sµ+|) < (rχ, |Sχ|). Moreover,
hλ, χi < hλ, µ+i.

Proof. By the property (2) in Lemma 5.2.1 every k for which hλ, βki > 0 belongs
to S+
χ and thus rµ < rχ or rµ = rχ and |Sµ| < |Sχ|. In other words (rµ, |Sµ|) <
(rχ, |Sχ|).

As (rµ, |Sµ|) depends only on the W-orbit of µ for the ∗-action, we also have
(rµ+ , |Sµ+|) < (rχ, |Sχ|) and hence (rµ+ , Sµ+ ) 6(cid:23) (rχ, Sχ). Property (1) in Lemma
5.2.5 then implies hλ, µ+i > hλ, χi.

The following lemma gives a description of the set of χ with given (rχ, Sχ) in terms
of objects related to Gλ.

Lemma 5.2.7. Let χ ∈ X(T ) and let λ be as in Lemma 5.2.1(2). Then the set

(5.7)

is equal to

where

{χ′ ∈ X(T )+ | (rχ′ , Sχ′ ) = (rχ, Sχ)}

(ν − ¯ρλ + rχΣ0

λ) ∩ X(T )λ

ν = − ¯ρ + ¯ρλ + χp.

Moreover ν is WGλ-invariant.

Proof. The fact that ν is WGλ-invariant is a direct consequence of Lemma 5.2.5 (2)
and the standard fact that − ¯ρ + ¯ρλ is WGλ-invariant.

By Lemma 5.2.1 we have

{χ′ ∈ X(T )+ | (rχ′ , Sχ′ ) = (rχ, Sχ)} = (− ¯ρ + χp + rχΣ0

λ) ∩ X(T )+.

By Lemma 5.2.8 below we may rewrite this as

{χ′ ∈ X(T )λ | (rχ′ , Sχ′ ) = (rχ, Sχ)} = (− ¯ρ + χp + rχΣ0

λ) ∩ X(T )λ

which is the same as

(ν − ¯ρλ + rΣ0

λ) ∩ X(T )λ. (cid:3)

We have used the following result.

Lemma 5.2.8. Let χ ∈ X(T )+ and let λ be as in Lemma 5.2.1(2). If χ ∈ X(T )+
and χ′ ∈ X(T )λ such that (rχ′ , Sχ′ ) = (rχ, Sχ) then χ′ ∈ X(T )+.

Proof. We assume that we are not in the trivial case otherwise there is nothing to
do. We ﬁrst verify sα∗χ′ 6= χ′ for all α ∈ W. This implies that χ′+ exists. Assume
on the contrary that sα∗χ′ = χ′ for some α. By the uniqueness of the minimal
expression in Lemma 5.2.1 and the fact that (rχ′ , |Sχ′ |) does not depend on the
W-orbit for the ∗-action we obtain that S+
λ is sα-invariant. Using the
formula (5.4) we ﬁnd hλ, χi = hλ, sα∗χi. Then Lemma 5.1.1 implies sα ∈ WGλ.
However this is excluded by the fact that sα∗χ′ = χ′ and χ′ ∈ X(T )λ.

χ = T +

χ′ = S+

Assume χ′

6∈ X(T )+. By the above discussion there exists 1 6= w ∈ W such
that w∗χ′ is dominant. Furthermore w 6∈ WGλ as χ′ ∈ X(T )λ. Then Lemma 5.1.1
implies hλ, w∗χ′i < hλ, χ′i = hλ, χi.

From the fact that (rw∗χ′ , |Sw∗χ′ |) = (rχ′ , |Sχ′ |) = (rχ, |Sχ|) we deduce (rχ, Sχ) 6<
(rw∗χ′ , Sw∗χ′ ). Then property (1) in Lemma 5.2.5 implies hλ, χi ≤ hλ, w∗χ′i. This
is a contradiction.

5.3. G/Ge-action on X(T )+. Here we allow G to be non-connected. W is still
a G-representation. We apply the previous results with G replaced by Ge.
In
particular T ⊂ B ⊂ Ge. As we have seen in §3.7 the group G/Ge acts on X(T )+
via ¯g(χ) = χ ◦ σ−1
¯g .

Since G/Ge also acts on the weights on W , it may be made to act on {1, . . . , d}
¯g . This action extends to an action of G/Ge on the

via ¯g(i) = j if βj = βi ◦ σ−1
partially ordered set (R+ × P({1, . . . , d})3, ≺) introduced above.

Lemma 5.3.1. The map

X(T )+ 7→ R+ × P({1, . . . , d})3 : χ 7→ (rχ, Sχ)

(5.8)
is G/Ge-equivariant. Moreover if χ ∈ X(T )+, ¯g ∈ G/Ge and λ ∈ Y (T )R is as
in Lemma 5.2.1(2) then σ¯g ◦ λ ∈ Y (T )−
R satisﬁes property (2) in Lemma 5.2.1 for
χ ◦ σ¯g. Consequently, (T ±

σ¯g◦λ) = ¯g−1(T ±

σ¯g ◦λ, T 0

λ , T 0

λ ).

Proof. Let χ ∈ X(T )+. As usual we may assume we are in the non-trivial case. We
obtain an expression of χ ◦ σ¯g of the form (5.2) with βi replaced by βi ◦ σg. Since
this expression in minimal for χ ◦ σ¯g (as otherwise applying − ◦ σ−1
¯g would give a
smaller expression for χ), (rχ◦σ¯g , Sχ◦σ¯g ) = ¯g−1(rχ, Sχ).

As hλ, β ◦ σ¯gi = hσ¯g ◦ λ, βi for all β ∈ X(T ), it easy to verify σ¯g ◦ λ ∈ Y (T )−
R
satisﬁes property (2) in Lemma 5.2.1 for χ ◦ σ¯g. This implies in particular the last
assertion of the lemma.
(cid:3)

5.4. Reduction settings. Here we allow G to be again non-connected.

Lemma 5.4.1. There exists a total ordering < on R+ × P({1, . . . , d})3 such that
the following conditions hold.

(1) If (r, |S|) < (r′, |S′|) then (r, S) < (r′, S′).
(2) If (r, S) < (r′, S′) and (r, S) and (r′, S′) are in diﬀerent G/Ge-orbits then

¯g(r, S) < ¯h(r′, S′) for all ¯g, ¯h in G/Ge.

Proof. The map (5.1) is G/Ge-equivariant. We choose an arbitrary totally ordering
on the ﬁbers of (5.1) compatible with condition (2). Combining this with (1)
completely ﬁxes <.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.4.2. It is clear that any total ordering < as in Lemma 5.4.1(1) reﬁnes
the partial ordering ≺.

Lemma-Deﬁnition 5.4.3. It is possible to choose for any χ ∈ X(T )+ a λχ ∈
Y (T )−

R such that the following conditions are satisﬁed

(1) λ = λχ satisﬁes the property (2) in Lemma 5.2.1.
(2) If (rχ′ , Sχ′ ) = (rχ, Sχ) then λχ = λχ′ .
(3) We have λχ◦σ¯g = σ¯g ◦ λχ for all ¯g ∈ G/Ge.
(4) If ¯g(T ±

λχ) then σ¯g ◦ λχ = λχ.

Now for χ ∈ X(T )+ write (rχ, Sχ) = ¯h(rχi , Sχi ) for suitable i and ¯h ∈ G/Ge.
Then we put λχ = σ¯h ◦ λi. It is clear that this is well deﬁned and has the requested
properties.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.4.4. Let (λχ)χ be as in Lemma 5.4.3. We have for ¯g ∈ G/Ge:

with equality if and only if ¯g ∈ (G/Ge)λχ .

hλχ, ¯g(χ)i ≥ hλχ, χi

Proof. By (5.8) we have

(5.9)

Hence in particular

(r¯g(χ), S¯g(χ)) = ¯g(rχ, Sχ).

(r¯g(χ), |S¯g(χ)|) = (rχ, |Sχ|)

and so (rχ, Sχ) 6≺ (r¯g(χ), S¯g(χ)). It follows from Lemma 5.2.5(2) that

hλχ, χi ≤ hλχ, ¯g(χ)i.

Also by Lemma 5.2.5 equality will happen precisely when (r¯g(χ), S¯g(χ)) = (rχ, Sχ)
which by (5.9) implies that ¯g stabilizes Sχ = (T +
). By Lemma 5.4.3(4)
λχ
this implies ¯g ∈ (G/Ge)λχ .

(cid:3)

Below we ﬁx (λχ)χ as in Lemma 5.4.3 and we choose a total ordering on R+ ×
P({1, . . . , d})3 as in Lemma 5.4.1. We put the induced ordering on I := {(rχ, Sχ) |
χ ∈ X(T )+} ⊂ R+ × P({1, . . . , d})3. As a totally ordered set we have I ∼= N. For
i ∈ I we put Fi = {χ ∈ X(T )+ | (rχ, Sχ) = i}. This gives a G/Ge-equivariant
partition

In each Fi we choose one representative which we denote by χi. We write λi = λχi ,
ri = rχi , Si = Sχi . By our choice of λχ and the deﬁnition of Fi, (ri, λi, Si) depends
only on i ∈ I and not on the choice of χi ∈ Fi.

For j ∈ I we write

(5.10)

X(T )+ =ai∈I

Fi.

L<j = [i∈I,i<j
L≤j = [i∈I,i≤j

Fi ⊂ X(T )+,

Fi ⊂ X(T )+.

Let J ⊂ I be the minimal representatives for the orbits of the action of G/Ge on I.
By the choice of J and property (2) in Lemma 5.4.1 the set {i ∈ I | i < j} is
G/Ge-invariant if j ∈ J and hence the same is true for L<j.

Corollary 5.4.5. Let j ∈ J be such that rj ≥ 1 and χ ∈ Fj . Then (G, B, T, X, L<j, χ, λj)
is a reduction setting.

Proof. We may reduce to the case that X is aﬃne. Then by Theorem 4.2.1 and
Proposition 4.1.4 we may assume G = Ge and X = W ∨. Thus we need to verify
the assumptions of Proposition 4.4.1. They are satisﬁed by Corollary 5.2.6 due to
the choice of λj = λχ for every χ ∈ Fj.

6. Proofs of the semi-orthogonal decompositions

In this section we will prove Theorem 1.1.2 and along the way we will also prove
Proposition 1.2.2 and Corollary 7.2. For the proof of Theorem 1.1.2 we select a ﬁnite

G-equivariant aﬃne G-varieties Xi. We choose a G-representation W such that W ∨

open aﬃne covering X//G = Si Ui and put Xi = π−1(Ui). Thus X = Si Xi for
has a T -stable point together with a closed G-equivariant embedding`i Xi ֒→ W ∨.

We use W to construct a partition (5.10) of X(T )+ as in §5.4. The arguments below
will be based on “reduction to the aﬃne case”, i.e. to one of the Xi.

For j ∈ I let D<j, D≤j be the triangulated subcategories of D(X/G) locally

generated by PL<j , PL≤j as in §3.5. and put Λ<j = πs∗ End X/G(PL<j ).

For j ∈ J let Dj be the triangulated subcategory of D(X/G) locally generated

by hRIndG

For a WGλ

Proposition 1.2.2 and Theorem 1.1.2 will be consequences of the following propo-

sition.

Proposition 6.1.

(1) If j 6∈ J then D<j = D≤j.

Assume that j ∈ J is such that rj ≥ 1. Then
(2) D<j ∼= D(Λ<j) and Λ<j has ﬁnite global dimension when restricted to aﬃne

opens in X//G.

(3) Dj ∼= D(Λrj ,λj ,νj ) for νj = − ¯ρ + ¯ρλj + (χj)p (where (χj )p was introduced
in §5.2) and Λrj ,λj ,νj has ﬁnite global dimension when restricted to aﬃne
opens in X//G.

Proof.

(4) D≤j = hDj, D<ji is a semi-orthogonal decomposition of D≤j.

(5) One has D(X/G) =Sj∈J Dj.
(1) We claim that Lχ∈L<j
prove that if χ ∈ Fj then V (χ) is a summand ofLχ∈L<j

V (χ). We only have to
V (χ). Since j 6∈ J
there is ¯g ∈ G/Ge such that ¯g(j) < j. Put χ′ = ¯g(χ) ∈ F¯g(j) ⊂ L<j. Using
(3.2), (3.3) we obtain

V (χ) = Lχ∈L≤j

V (χ′) = IndG
= IndG
∼= IndG
= V (χ) .

Ge VGe (χ′)

Ge σ−1

¯g

VGe (χ)

Ge VGe (χ)

(2) The fact that D<j = D(Λ<j) follows from Lemma 3.5.5. To prove that
Λ<j is locally of ﬁnite global dimension we may restrict to the case that
X is aﬃne. To prove that gl dim Λ<j < ∞, by [ˇSVdB15, Thm 4.3.1, Lem.
4.5.1] it suﬃces to consider the case X = W ∨ and G = Ge. We denote
˜PL<j ,χ = HomX/G(P<j , Pχ). By [ˇSVdB15, Lem. 11.1.1] it is enough to show
that pdim ˜PL<j ,χ < ∞ for every χ ∈ X(T )+. Assume that there exists χ

SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT STACKS

23

such that pdim ˜PL<j ,χ = ∞ and take χ ∈ X(T )+ with minimal (rχ, |Sχ|).
Then (rχ, Sχ) 6≤ (rµ, Sµ) for all µ ∈ L<j (for otherwise χ ∈ L<j and hence
pdim ˜PL<j ,χ = 0). Let λ = λχ.
It follows from Lemma 5.2.5 (1) that
hλ, χi < hλ, µi for all µ ∈ L<j. Thus, CL<j ,λ,χ := HomX/G(PL<j , Cλ,χ)
is acylic by (4.12) and the fact that the λ-weights of k[X λ,+] are ≤ 0 (see
§3.2). We have (rχ′ , |Sχ′ |) < (rχ, |Sχ|) for all ˜PL<j ,χ′ 6= ˜PL<j ,χ that appear
in CLi,λ,χ by (4.14) and Corollary 5.2.6. Hence pdim ˜PL<j ,χ′ < ∞ by the
minimality assumption, and therefore pdim ˜PL<j ,χ < ∞, a contradiction.
(3) Now we use the fact that (G, B, T, X, Lj, χ, λj) is a reduction setting for
Gλj ,+ (VGλj (χ) ⊗

χ ∈ Fj by Corollary 5.4.5. Let us abbreviate Dj,χ = RIndG
OX λj ,+ ). By Lemma 4.3.1 we have

πs∗ REnd X/G(⊕χ∈Fj Dj,χ) = πs∗ End X λ/ ¯Gλ(⊕χ∈Fj P ¯Gλ,χ)

and the latter is equal to Λrj ,λj ,νj by Lemma 5.2.7.

To prove that Λrj,λj ,νj locally has ﬁnite global dimension we may reduce
to the aﬃne case. Then by [ˇSVdB15, Thm 4.3.1, Lem. 4.5.1] we may reduce
to the case G = Ge and X = W ∨. Finally we invoke Proposition 1.2.1.

(4) The fact that D≤j is generated by D<j and Dj follows from (4.3). The fact
that HomX/G(D<j, Dj) = 0 follows from (4.1) by a suitable version of the
local global spectral sequence on X//G.

(5) This follows from Lemma 3.5.4.

Proof of Theorem 1.1.2. Put

j0 = min{j ∈ J | rj ≥ 1}.

Then we have by Lemma 3.5.5 D≤j0 = D(Λ1,0,0). Now write

{j ∈ J | rj ≥ 1} = {j0, j1, j2, . . .}.

Put D0 = D≤j0 and for i > 0 let D−i be the right orthogonal of D≤ji−1 = D<ji in
DL≤ji
(6.1)

. By Proposition 6.1 (1,4,5) we have a semi-orthogonal decomposition

D(X/G) = h. . . , D−2, D−1, D0i

and by Proposition 6.1(3) each of the D−1, D−2,. . . has the required form. The
corresponding statement for ˜DX/G follows by replacing X//G by open subschemes.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.2. If follows from Lemma 3.5.7 that the D−j ⊂ D(X/G) as D≤j are
admissible.

Proof of Proposition 1.2.2. This corresponds to the special case X = W ∨ in the
proof of Theorem 1.1.2.

7. The case that X does not have a T -stable point.

In this section we will assume throughout that G is connected and that X is a
connected smooth G-variety such that a good quotient X//G exists. We will give
an alternative semi-orthogonal decomposition of D(X/G) in case X does not have
a T -stable point. The results in this section are mostly independent from the rest
of the paper.

Lemma 7.1. Assume that X does not have a T -stable point. Then at least one of
the following settings holds:

24

ˇSPELA ˇSPENKO AND MICHEL VAN DEN BERGH

(1) There is a non-trivial normal connected subgroup K of G acting trivially

on X.

(2) There is a non-trivial central one parameter group ν : Gm → Z(G) such

that X = X ν,+.

Proof. Since X does not have a T -stable point we have

(7.1)

X = [σ∈X(T )−{0}

X σ,+ .

It is well-known and easy to see that there are only a ﬁnite number of distinct
X σ,+. Indeed: by covering X//G by a ﬁnite number of aﬃnes, it suﬃces to verify
this in the aﬃne case and then it follows by embedding X into a representation.
Hence since the union in (7.1) is ﬁnite and X is irreducible we ﬁnd that there is
some σ ∈ X(T ) − {0} such that X = X σ,+.

It follows that X = X wσ,+ for every w ∈ W. Put ν = Pw∈W wσ. Then ν is

a W-invariant 1-parameter subgroup of T and in particular its image is contained
in the center of G.

We claim X ν,+ = X, X ν ⊂ X σ. We may check this in the case that X is aﬃne.
Let C ⊂ X(T )R be the cone spanned by the weights of k[X]. Since X σ,+ = X we
have hσ, Ci ≤ 0. Since C is W-invariant we immediately deduce hν, Ci ≤ 0 and
hence X ν,+ = X.

To prove X ν ⊂ X σ we have to verify that if χ ∈ C and hν, χi = 0 then hσ, χi = 0.

be zero if hσ, w−1χi = 0 for all w ∈ W.

To prove this it suﬃces to observe that hν, χi =Pw∈Whσ, w−1χi and this can only

If ν 6= 0 then we are in situation (2). If ν = 0 then X ν = X. Hence also X σ = X
by the above discussion. Therefore (1) holds with K being the identity component
of ker(G → Aut(X)). The group K is not trivial as it contains im σ.
(cid:3)

To continue it will be convenient to slightly generalize our setting in a similar
way as [ˇSVdB15, Thm 1.6.3]. We will however use diﬀerent notations which are
more adapted to the current setting. We will assume that G contains a ﬁnite central
subgroup A acting trivially on X with ¯G := G/A. Let X(A) := Hom(A, Gm) be the
character group of A. For τ ∈ X(A) let D(X/G)τ be the triangulated subcategory
of D(X/G) consisting of complexes on which A acts as τ . We have an orthogonal
decomposition

(7.2)

D(X/G) = Mτ ∈X(A)

D(X/G)τ

and moreover D(X/G)0 = D(X/ ¯G). In general we should think of D(X/G)τ as a
twisted version of D(X/ ¯G).

Proposition 7.2. Let τ ∈ X(A). Then there exists a semi-orthogonal decomposi-
tion of D(X/G)τ of the form described in Theorem 1.1.2.
Proof. Let the notation be as in §6. We have A ⊂ T . Let ¯T = T /A. Then there is
an exact sequence

0 → X( ¯T ) → X(T ) → X(A) → 0

Let X( ¯T )τ ⊂ X(T ) be the inverse image of τ ∈ X(A). Let χ ∈ Fj ∩X( ¯T )τ . Since A
acts trivially on X, it acts with the character τ on the right-hand side of (4.3) with

SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT STACKS

L = L<j. Since πs∗ Hom X/G(PG,χ′ , PG,χ) = 0 if χ′ 6∈ X( ¯T )τ , (4.3) is thus still an
isomorphism if we replace L<j by L<j,τ = L<j ∩ X( ¯T )τ . Put

Λ<j,τ = πs∗ End X/G(PL<j,τ ),
Lj,τ = X( ¯T )λj

(µ),

Λj,τ = (End(Uj,τ ) ⊗ OX λj )

¯Gλj

(here ¯Gλ ⊂ Gλ as in §3.7, it is not related to ¯G). We have Λ<j = ⊕τ ∈X(A)Λ<j,τ ,
Λj = ⊕τ ∈X(A)Λj,τ . As Λ<j and Λj have ﬁnite global dimension when restricted
to aﬃne opens in X//G, the same holds for Λ<j,τ , Λj,τ . Arguing as above we thus
obtain a semi-orthogonal decomposition D≤j,τ = hDj,τ , D<j,τ i (with the obvious
deﬁnitions for Dj,τ , D<j,τ ), D<j,τ ∼= D(Λ<j,τ ), Dj,τ ∼= D(Λj,τ ). Then the proof
continues as before.
(cid:3)

If K is a connected normal subgroup of G then we will deﬁne a pseudo-complement
of K as a connected normal subgroup Q of G such that K and Q commute, G = KQ
and K ∩ Q is ﬁnite. It follows easily from [Spr98, Theorem 8.1.5, Corollary 8.1.6]
that such a pseudo-complement always exists.

Proposition 7.3. Assume X does not have a T -stable point and that we are in the
situation of Proposition 7.1(1). Let Q be a pseudo-complement of K in G. Then
there is a ﬁnite central subgroup AQ of Q acting trivially on X such that there is
an orthogonal decomposition

for a suitable collection of (µi)i∈I ∈ X(AQ).
Proof. Let ˜G := K × Q → G be the multiplication map and let ˜A ⊂ K × Q be
the inverse image of A. Let AK ⊂ K, AQ ⊂ Q be the images of ˜A under the
projections K × Q → K, Q. It is easy to see that AQ acts trivially on X. Let ˜τ be
the composition ˜A → A τ−→ Gm. In a similar way, if µ ∈ X(AK) or µ ∈ X(AQ) then
we denote by ˜µ the element of X( ˜A), obtained by composing µ with the appropriate
projections ˜A → AK , AQ.

We have

(7.4)

D(X/G)τ = D(X/ ˜G)˜τ .

Let Irr(K) be the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of K.
We have an orthogonal decomposition

(7.5)

D(X/Q) → D(X/ ˜G) : (FV )V 7→ ⊕V ∈Irr(K)V ⊗k FV .

MV ∈Irr(K)

If V ∈ Irr(K) then AK acts on K via a character which we denote by χV ∈ X(AK).
Combining (7.4) and (7.5) yields

D(X/G)τ ∼=

D(X/Q)µ

(µ,V )∈X(AQ)×Irr(K),˜µ+ ˜χV =˜τ

which implies (7.3).

Proposition 7.4. Assume X does not have a T -stable point and that we are in the
situation of Proposition 7.1(2). Let Q be a pseudo-complement of im ν in G. Then
there is a ﬁnite central subgroup AQ of Q acting trivially on X ν such that there is
a semi-orthogonal decomposition

(7.6)

D(X/G)τ = hD(X ν/Q)µi | i ∈ Ii

for a suitable totally ordered set I and a collection of (µi)i∈I ∈ X(AQ).

Proof. Without loss of generality we may, and we will, assume that ν is injective.
We put K = im ν ∼= Gm and we borrow the associated notation from the proof of
Proposition 7.3. One checks that in this case AQ acts indeed trivially on X ν. The
set Irr(K) is equal to {(χn)n} where χn ∈ X(K) is such that χn(z) = zn.

We know by Lemma 3.5.4 that D(X/ ˜G) is locally generated by Pn,V := (χn ⊗
V := V ⊗ OX ν ∈ D(X ν/Q).

V ⊗ OX )n,V , with n ∈ Z, V ∈ Irr(Q). We also put P ν
We claim that for n ≤ m one has

(7.7) πs∗ RHom X/ ˜G(Pn,V , Pm,V ′ ) =(0

if n < m
if n = m

πs,∗js,∗ RHom X ν /Q(P ν

V , P ν

V ′ )

where j : X ν → X is the embedding and js : X ν/Q → X/ ˜G is the corresponding
map of quotient stacks.

To prove this we may reduce to the case that X// ˜G is aﬃne. Then as usual ν
induces a grading on k[X] which, as ν is central, is compatible with the G-action.
In the aﬃne case πs,∗ RHom X/ ˜G(Pn,V , Pm,V ′ ) is the quasi-coherent sheaf on
X//G associated to the k[X]G-module given by (Hom(V, V ′) ⊗ k[X]m−n) ˜G which is
zero if n < m since the hypothesis X = X ν,+ implies that the grading on k[X] is
concentrated in negative degree. Similarly if n = m then we have (Hom(V, V ′) ⊗
k[X]m−n) ˜G = (Hom(V, V ′) ⊗ k[X ν])Q ﬁnishing the proof of (7.7).

Let Dn ⊂ D(X/ ˜G) be locally generated by (P−n,V )V ∈Irr(Q). Then using Propo-

sition 3.5.8 and (7.7) we see that we have a semi-orthogonal decomposition

(7.8)

D(X/ ˜G) = hDn | n ∈ Zi .

The next step is to describe the Dn. We claim that there is an equivalence of
categories

Dn → D(X ν/Q) : F 7→ χn ⊗ Lj∗
(7.9)
Let F, F ′ ∈ Dn. We have to prove that the natural map

s (F ) .

RHomX/ ˜G(F, F ′) → RHomX ν /Q(χn ⊗ Lj∗

s (F¸), χn ⊗ Lj∗

s (F ′))

is an isomorphism. Using the local global spectral sequence it suﬃces to prove that

πs,∗ RHom X/ ˜G(F, F ′) → π∗Rjs,∗ RHom X/ ˜G(χn ⊗ Lj∗

s (F ), χn ⊗ Lj∗

s (F ′))

is an isomorphism. To do this we may assume that X// ˜G is aﬃne. Then we can
check it on the generators P−n,V of Dn and ﬁnally we invoke 7.7.

Combining the equivalence (7.9) with the semiorthogonal decomposition (7.8)

we obtain a a semi-orthogonal decomposition

D(X/ ˜G) = hD(X ν/Q) | n ∈ Zi

SEMI-ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION OF GIT QUOTIENT STACKS

27

Considering suitable subset of the local generators one obtains in the same way
a semi-orthogonal decomposition of D(X/ ˜G)˜τ . To be more precise consider the
following set

S = {(n, µ) ∈ Z × AQ | − ˜χn + ˜µ = ˜τ }

Let ≺ be the partial ordering on S induced from the projection S → Z.
I.e.
(n, µ) ≺ (n′, µ′) if and only if n < n′. Let < be a total ordering on S which reﬁnes
≺. Then we have a semi-orthogonal decomposition

D(X/ ˜G)˜τ = hD(X ν/Q)µ | (n, µ) ∈ Si .

Combining this with the identiﬁcation (7.4) yields (7.6).

(cid:3)

Remark 7.5. Even if A = 0 (and hence D(X/G)τ = D(X/G)), the group AQ and
the twisting characters µi will generally be non-trivial in Propositions 7.3,7.4.

Remark 7.6. Note that in Propositions 7.3,7.4 we have dim Q < dim G. Thus we
have made genuine progress. By repeatedly applying Propositions 7.3,7.4 we reduce
to a semi-orthogonal decomposition of D(X/G)τ involving a set of D(X ′/G′)τ ′ such
that X ′ has a T ′-stable point for T ′ a maximal torus of G′, thus justifying Remark
1.2.5 (and also making it more precise).
