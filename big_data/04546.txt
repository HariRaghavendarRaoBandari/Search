Abstract

We investigate the noise in single layer graphene devices from equilibrium to far-from equilibrium

and found that the 1/f noise shows an anomalous dependence on the source-drain bias voltage

(VSD). While the Hooge’s relation is not the case around the charge neutrality point, we found

that it is recovered at very low VSD region. We propose that the depinning of the electron-hole

puddles is induced at ﬁnite VSD, which may explain this anomalous noise behavior.

Graphene is a two dimensional material with gate-tunable high-mobility carriers, which

makes it one of the most promising materials for new electronic devices such as high speed

transistors [1]. As the usefulness of the devices is hampered by electrical noise, to investigate

the noise mechanism is signiﬁcant [2]. In addition to the purpose for the applications, it is

scientiﬁcally important to investigate the noise as it gives us a variety of information on the

electronic transport.

The 1/f noise is the electrical noise observed in many electronic devices [2]. Various

physical mechanisms such as trapping-detrapping process of carriers or disorder scattering

cause the resistance ﬂuctuation and thus the 1/f noise. There is an empirical expression for

the 1/f noise, namely, Hooge’s relation [3], which widely holds true in conventional metals

and semiconductors. It tells that the voltage noise power spectral density SV is expressed

by

SV (f ) = A

where f and VSD are frequency and source-drain bias voltage, respectively. Here A is called

noise amplitude. Usually, A is inversely proportional to the number of charge carriers in the

sample N, and is proportional to Hooge’s parameter αH. Although a rigorous theoretical

background for this relation is not yet established, the reduction of noise amplitude with

an increase of N in principle occurs through a reduction in the relative ﬂuctuation in the

number of charge carrier or through a better screening of charged scattering centers.

So far, several groups reported that the noise amplitude of the 1/f noise in graphene shows

non-monotonic gate voltage dependence [4–12] unlike a naive expectation from Hooge’s

relation; the noise amplitude unexpectedly becomes minimum around the Dirac point, or the

charge neutrality point (CNP), where the carrier density is minimum. As the distance from

the CNP increases by changing the gate voltage, the noise amplitude increases to its local

maximum and then decreases again, leading to the “M-shape” gate voltage dependence [4–9].

Here, we report an anomalous dependence on the source-drain bias voltage of the 1/f

noise in single layer graphene devices. The previous experiments were conducted in the large

VSD region, which is several tens of mV [4, 6–12]. In contrast, we systematically studied

the 1/f noise for wide VSD region and observed that the behavior of the noise amplitude is

strongly dependent on VSD; at high VSD region, the “M-shape” gate voltage dependence is

observed, while Hooge’s relation is recovered at very low VSD region. We propose that the

VSD-induced depinning of the electron-hole puddles is likely to explain this anomalous noise

2

behavior.

A single layer graphene ﬁlm was exfoliated on a Si/SiO2 substrate using the conventional

mechanical exfoliation method [13]. The Si/SiO2 substrate works as a back gate to tune

the carrier density in graphene by applying the voltage (VBG). The optical picture of the

device is shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The conductance and the noise measurements were

performed at 1.6 K in the variable temperature insert (VTI by Oxford Inc.) as shown in

the schematic picture of the measurement setup in Fig. 1(b) [14, 15]. The dc current with a

small ac modulation was applied to the graphene sample through a 1 MΩ resistor to obtain

the diﬀerential conductance G via standard lock-in technique. To measure the voltage noise

spectral density at the device, two pairs of lead were connected across the device and the two

voltage signals are independently ampliﬁed by the two room-temperature ampliﬁers (LI-75A

by NF Corporation). In order to reduce the external noise, the measured two sets of the time

domain data were cross-correlated to yield the noise power spectral density through the fast

Fourier transformation (FFT). We measured two graphene devices (♯1 and ♯2) with almost

same size and geometry and obtained the consistent result regarding to the VSD-dependent

behavior of the noise amplitude. Here we discuss the result obtained in the device ♯1.

The gate voltage dependence of the conductance at zero source-drain bias voltage (VSD =

0 V) is shown in Fig. 1(a) as a function of VBG − VCNP. Here VCNP = 4.0 V is the back gate

voltage which gives the conductance minimum, signaling the CNP. The electron and hole

mobilities were estimated from Fig. 1(a) to be µe = 4×103 cm2/Vs and µh = 5×103 cm2/Vs,

respectively [15]. These mobilities were not so high, which may be due to the PMMA resist

covering the graphene.

Fig. 1(c) shows a typical measured noise spectral density as a function of frequency. At

VSD = 0 V, the noise, which consists of the thermal noise of the device and the residual

ampliﬁer noise, is independent of f . At a ﬁnite VSD, on the other hand, the noise becomes

dependent on f such that it is proportional to 1/f β, where β ∼ 1, after the frequency-

independent noises are subtracted. At each VBG, the noise is measured for −4 mV ≤ VSD ≤

4 mV.

From the obtained noise in the range between 1 kHz and 10 kHz, the numerical ﬁtting

is performed to deduce the frequency normalized noise SV ·f . The obtained SV ·f is plotted

as a function of VSD with the diﬀerential conductance at ﬁnite VSD away from the CNP

(VBG − VCNP = 15 V) in Fig. 2(a) and near the CNP (VBG − VCNP = −1 V) in Fig. 2(b). The

3

SV ·f away from the CNP shows an expected parabolic dependence to VSD. This conﬁrms

that the noise arises from the resistance ﬂuctuation, which is converted into the voltage

noise by the current. Although SV ·f near the CNP also shows a parabolic dependence, the

shapes changes around |VSD| = V C

SD ∼ 0.6 mV as shown in Figs. 2(b) and (c). Figure 2(c)

is an expanded view of the region surrounded by the bold dashed line in Fig. 2(b). At the

same time, the conductance shows a slight VSD-dependence in the regime of |VSD| ≤ V C

SD as

shown in Fig. 2(b). These may come from the same mechanism as we discuss below. The

similar behaviors of the SV ·f around ±V C

SD were observed for other gate voltages near the

CNP.

The numerical ﬁtting is performed using the relation SV ·f = AV 2

SD to obtain the dimen-

sionless noise amplitude A.

In this analysis, we separately deduce the A in the low VSD

regime (|VSD| ≤ V C

SD) and the high VSD regime (|VSD| ≫ V C

SD) at every gate voltage VBG.

VBG-dependence of A for |VSD| ≤ V C

SD and for |VSD| ≫ V C

SD are shown in the middle and

bottom panels of Fig. 3, respectively, together with the conductance in the top panel. The

bottom axis is the gate voltage VBG − VCNP and the top axis represents the carrier density

n which is calculated from the relation n = CBG(VBG − VCNP)/e (CBG is the back gate ca-

pacitance per unit area). The deduced noise amplitudes A are of the order of 10−8 or 10−9,

being consistent with the previous studies [4, 6, 7, 9–12].

The behaviors of the noise around CNP in the low VSD region and in the high VSD region

are very diﬀerent between each other. In the former, it is maximum at the CNP and decreases

as |VBG − VCNP| increases, resulting in the “Λ-shape” gate dependence as is expected from

Hooge’s relation. In the latter, on the other hand, the noise amplitude is minimum around

the CNP, and as the distance from the CNP increases, it increases until |VBG − VCNP| ∼ 1 V,

and then it decreases again. This “M-shape” gate dependence was often reported in previous

studies [4–9]. Away from the CNP, the A’s are as low as ≪ 3 × 10−10 both in low bias and

high bias regimes. They are slightly bigger in the electron side (n > 0) than those in the

hole side (n < 0), which may reﬂect the diﬀerence of the mobilities (µh > µe in the present

case).

Here we discuss a possible scenario that could explain the observed behaviors.

It is

widely accepted that charged impurities on the substrate induce potential ﬂuctuation in the

graphene and create spatial charge inhomogeneities (electron-hole puddles [16]). Away from

the CNP, the hole (electron) puddles are completely ﬁlled by electron (hole) whole of the

4

sample. As a result, the puddles do not largely aﬀect the conduction. Around the CNP,

when the electrons (holes) come into the hole (electron) puddles, they need ﬁnite activation

energy to escape from the regions. Around zero temperature the carriers in the puddles

are frozen, or in other words, the puddles are pinned [17]. In such a situation, the carriers

in the puddles cannot contribute to the screening of the scattering centers in the low VSD

regime, and therefore, the device simply behaves as a disordered system with very low carrier

density. Here, Hooge’s relation is expected to hold as seen in our observation.

Now, what happens to the puddles at high VSD regime? To explain the observed crossover

from the “Λ-shape” to “M-shape”, we expect a physical mechanism to reduce the eﬀect of

the puddles. Thus we would propose that, in the high VSD regime, presumably due to the

applied electric ﬁeld across the device and/or due to the injected carriers, the puddles are

“depinned”, and the carriers trapped by those puddles start to move. This assumption could

explain the reduction of the 1/f noise at the CNP at high VSD regime, as these carriers now

participate to screen the scattering centers. The slight increase of the conductance around

|VSD| = V C

SD as seen in Fig. 2(b) may reﬂect this phenomenon. As the distance from the CNP

increases, the depining of the puddles, if any, do not aﬀect the noise amplitude, as there are

suﬃcient carriers already. In the previous studies, the measurements were performed in the

high VSD regime, and only the “M-shape” behavior was observed [4–9].

To estimate the inﬂuence of the puddle eﬀect, we calculate the local carrier density of the

puddles. According to [18], the carrier density in the puddles (npuddle) and the density of the

charged impurities in the sample (nimp) is calculated from the carrier density dependence of

the conductivity to be |npuddle| ∼ 1.2×1011 cm−2 and nimp ∼ 10 ×1011cm−2 respectively. This

nimp is the typical value for the disordered graphene on Si/SiO2 with a similar mobility [19].

|npuddle| ∼ 1.2 × 1011 cm−2 is consistent with the carrier density where the noise amplitude in

high bias regime shows local maximum |nmax| ∼ 1.2 × 1011 cm−2(shown in the bottom panel

of Fig.3). In addition, it was recently reported that while the noise of the graphene device on

Si/SiO2 showed the “M-shape” gate dependence, the one on h-BN showed “Λ-shape” [12].

These facts may support our idea that the puddles are responsible for this anomolous noise

behavior.

In conclusion, we observed the anomalous behaviors in the 1/f noise in graphene; in

the low bias voltage regime, the noise shows “Λ-shape” gate dependence, which is consistent

with Hooge’s relation, while in the high bias regime the noise exhibits well-known “M-shape”

5

dependence. These diﬀerent noise behaviors may result from the eﬀect of the electron-hole

puddles and their depining induced by the source-drain bias voltage. Our work shows that

the 1/f noise study could give us a clue to understand the dynamics of the electronic state

around CNP and thus contribute to the realization of low-noise graphene devices.
