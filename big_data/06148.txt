Abstract

The exact analytical solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for the generalized symmetrical

Woods-Saxon potential are examined for the scattering, bound and quasi-bound states in one

dimension. The reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients are analytically obtained. Then, the cor-

relations between the potential parameters and the reﬂection-transmission coeﬃcients are investi-

gated, and a transmission resonance condition is derived. Occurrence of the transmission resonance

has been shown when incident energy of the particle is equal to one of the resonance energies of

the quasi-bound states.

INTRODUCTION

The investigation of the transmission resonance of a quantum particle has raised a great

deal of interest in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum mechanics in the last two decades

[1–11], especially, the supercriticality concept which has a transmission resonance at zero

momentum has been studied for scattering particles through a barrier potential that has

a half bound for the inverted version of the barrier potential [1–3]. Dombey et. al have

shown that scattering of the Dirac particles through a square barrier potential lead to a

transmission resonance at zero momentum. In other words their reﬂection and transmission

coeﬃcients are zero and one, respectively [1].

On the other hand, it has been shown that the Woods-Saxon potential plays an important

role in atom-molecule [12] and nuclear physics for both scattering and bound states [13–15].

In the literature, we ﬁnd out that the transmission resonance and the supercriticality have

been examined for a particle tunneling through Wood-Saxon potential [2, 3]. There, they

have solved the Dirac equation in which the particle has a half-bound state for potential well

at E = −m and an anti-particle for the potential barrier at E = m. Furthermore, scattering

and bound state solutions of the one-dimensional mass dependent Dirac equation with the

Woods-Saxon potential have been obtained and supercriticality conditions for diﬀerent mass

functions have been presented [10, 11]. Not only Woods-Saxon potential, but also other

potentials such as asymmetric Hulth´en potential [6], symmetric screened potential [7, 8], a

double-cusp barrier [9] have been investigated.

The transmission resonance and supercriticality concept have also been examined for a

Klein-Gordon particle moving under the Woods-Saxon potential [4]. Rojas and Villalba

have been obtained the transmission resonance for arbitrary potential parameters and have

been concluded that there is no supercritical states. Moreover, solution of the Klein-Gordon

equation for the asymmetric Woods-Saxon potential has been examined for both scattering

and bound states. The transmission resonance and supercriticaly conditions are given in

Ref. [5].

In literature, not only scattering states, also bound states solutions have been studied

for the Woods-Saxon potential and its modiﬁed versions for the Schr¨odinger [16–18] and

the Dirac equations [19]. Furthermore, within the framework of the spin and pseudospin

symmetry, the analytical solutions of the Woods-Saxon and its generalized versions are

2

solved for Dirac equation and obtained the bound state energies with their corresponding

wave functions for the particle and antiparticle [20, 21].

In this paper, we propose a potential model that is the symmetric version of the gen-

eralized Woods-Saxon potential [18]. The generalized symmetric Woods-Saxon (GSWS)

potential model is more ﬂexible and useful model than the Woods-Saxon potential in order

to examine the scattering, bound and quasi-bound state solutions of the wave equations

so that the GSWS potential can be applied to physical phenomena such as the scattering,

transmission resonance, supercriticality, decay, fusion, ﬁssion etc.. Especially, the GSWS po-

tential can be useful model in description of the surface interaction of the particles[22–26].

Since GSWS potential model has many applications in physics, here we show how to solve

the Schr¨odinger equation analytically for the GSWS potential in one dimension in case of

the scattering, bound and quasi-bound states. Moreover, we examine correlations between

the potential parameters with the reﬂection-transmission coeﬃcients in the case of scatter-

ing state, with the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions in the case

of bound state, and ﬁnally with the resonance energy eigenvalues and their corresponding

wave functions in the case of quasi-bound states.

In the following section, we present the analytical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in

one dimension for the GSWS potential model for the following cases: scattering, bound and

quasi-bound states. We discuss the analytic and numeric results of the model potential. In

section III, our conclusion is given.

II. THE MODEL

The GSWS potential in one dimension can be given by,

V (x) = θ(−x)" −

V0

1 + e−a(x+L) +

W0e−a(x+L)

(cid:0)1 + e−a(x+L)(cid:1)2# + θ(x)" −

V0

1 + ea(x−L) +

W0ea(x−L)

(cid:0)1 + ea(x−L)(cid:1)2#,

(1)

where θ(±x) are the Heaviside step functions. The depth parameters of the potential V0 and

W0 can be positive or negative. In the model there are other positive and real parameters L

and a, namely control parameters, adjust the shape of the potential. In Fig.(1) we present

various shapes of the GSWS potential versus changing the sings of the potential depth

parameters.

3

GSWS potential given in Eq.(1) diﬀers from the Woods-Saxon potential by its second

terms in the square brackets. While V0 > 0, these terms modify the potential at the surface

region which constitute either a pocket for W0 < 0, or a barrier for W0 > 0. This provides

a great advantage in description of the interacting particle for the bound, quasi-bound and

scattering states [22–26]. Hence the model potential is very useful to determine the behavior

of a particle in the bound, quasi-bound and scattering states. In the literature there is also

the modiﬁed version of Woods-Saxon potential(MWS) similar to following equation [5],

V (x) = θ(−x)" −

V0

p + qe−a(x+L)# + θ(x)" −

V0

p + qea(x−L)#,

(2)

where p > 0 and q > 0 are integer numbers.

In Fig.(1), we also show the WS, VW S(x)

and MWS, VM W S(x) potentials. The MWS potential reduces to WS potential for p = 1

and q = 1 in Fig.(1). When increasing p parameter, depth of the potential decreases

for MWS potential. As increasing q, geometry of the potential changes both volume and

surface regions of the potential. The GSWS potential have two advantages. Firstly, we can

modify any region of the Woods-Saxon potential with surface term. The surface term of the

potential has signiﬁcant important in description of surface interaction[22–26]. Secondly, we

can simultaneously examine interaction of the particle with GSWS potential for the bound,

scattering and quasi-bound states in terms of the convenient potential parameters in Fig.(1).

In present paper we only focus on the case of V0 > 0 and W0 > 0 depth parameters and

examine,

• the scattering states Es > 0,

• the bound states −V0 < Eb

n < 0,

• the quasi-bound states 0 < Eqb

n < (V0−W0)2

4W0

.

n, Eqb

states, respectively. The term (V0−W0)2

n and Es are the energies of the particle in the bound, quasi-bound and scattering
is height of the barrier (HB) which can be derived

4W0

from the potential. One can choose diﬀerent signs of the potential depth parameters and

examine other shapes of potential that is represented in Fig.(1) the scattering Es > 0 states

in case of V0 > 0 and W0 < 0, one can only investigate bound and scattering states since

there is no barrier term in the potential. Moreover, in case of V0 < 0 and W0 > 0, one can

4

study the quasi-bound and scattering states. Finally, in case of V0 < 0 W0 < 0, one can

examine the bound, quasi-bound and scattering states.

A ﬁnal remark before we proceed, the model potential is completely symmetric with

respect to y-axis i.e V (−x) = V (x). Therefore we have to obtain even and odd solutions

for the GSWS potential.

We consider a particle with a mass of m moving under the GSWS potential, one dimen-

sional Scr¨odinger equation can be given by,

2m

2 (cid:16)E − V (x)(cid:17)iφ(x) = 0.

(3)

Due to discontinuity in the potential, we examine the analytical solution of the GSWS

potential at two regions, i.e, x < 0 and x > 0. Inserting Eq.(1) into Eq.(3) for x < 0 region,

we have,

In this equation, there are two singular points, i.e., z = 0 and z = 1. In order to remove

these singularities, we have to examine asymptotic behavior of Eq.(6). At x → −∞ (z → 0)

limit, the dominant terms in Eq.(6) are,

We deﬁne φL(z) ≡ (z − 1)ν with ν ≡ iκ

2 (E + V0). Therefore we suggest the

wavefunction as φL(z) ≡ zµ(z − 1)νf (z) and insert into Eq.(6) we obtain,

a and κ ≡ q 2m

z(1 − z)f ′′ +h(1 + 2µ) − (1 + 2µ + 2ν + 1)zif ′ −h2µν + µ + ν + 2ǫ2 − β2if = 0. (9)

We compare Eq.(9) with the hypergeometric equation [27] which is,

z(1 − z)w′′ +hc − (1 + a + b)ziw′ − abw = 0,

and its analytical solution is,

(10)

w(z) = A 2F1[a, b, c; z] + Bz1−c

2F1[1 + a − c, 1 + b − c, 2 − c; z].

(11)

We can easily obtain the general solution of the GSWS potential for x < 0 region as follows:

φL(z) = D1zµ(z−1)ν

2F1[a1, b1, c1; z]+D2z−µ(z−1)ν

2F1[1+a1−c1, 1+b1−c1, 2−c1; z], (12)

where a1, b1 and c1 are,

a1 ≡ µ + θ + ν,

b1 ≡ 1 + µ − θ + ν,

c1 ≡ 1 + 2µ.

(13)

Here θ ≡ 1

and the deﬁnitions in Eq.(5) we easily get,

(14)

(15)

By using the procedure after Eq.(6), in terms of Eq.(13) we can obtain,

φR(t) = D3tµ(t−1)ν

2F1[a1, b1, c1; t]+D4t−µ(t−1)ν

2F1[1+a1 −c1, 1+b1 −c1, 2−c1; t]. (16)

After obtaining the wave function of the GSWS potential, we can examine the interaction of

the particle in the GSWS potential for the case of the continuum, bound and quasi-bound

states.

6

A. The Continuum States

In the continuum states, we assume that the particle is coming from negative inﬁnity

and going to positive inﬁnity. Additionally, we could also assume the particle as incident

from the right side of the potential well, due to symmetric form of the potential we could

obtain the same results that we ﬁnd from left side. In the continuum states the energy of

the particle is positive (Es > 0 and k > 0) and has continuum values. In all calculations,

we assume aL >> 1 which adjusts the width of the barrier. In case of continuum states the

wave functions are given by Eq.(12) and Eq.(16) with µ = ik

for k2 > 0,

ν = iκ

2 (Es + V0). In the negative domain of x-axis, we have to investigate the
asymptotic behavior of the wave function in Eq.(12). In case of x →-∞ (z → 0), z ≈ ea(x+L)

a and κ =q 2m

a and k = q 2mEs

2

and 2F1[a, b, c; 0] = 1. Therefore we have the incident and reﬂected waves,

φL(x → −∞, z → 0) → e− πκ

a (cid:16)D1eik(x+L) + D2e−ik(x+L)(cid:17).

(17)

In case of x → 0 (z → 1), we have to investigate the behavior of the hypergeometric function

by using the relation [27],

2F1(a, b, c; y) =

Γ(c)Γ(c − a − b)
Γ(c − a)Γ(c − b) 2F1(a, b, a + b − c + 1; 1 − y)
+(1 − y)c−a−b Γ(c)Γ(a + b − c)

Γ(a)Γ(b)

2F1(c − a, c − b, c − a − b + 1; 1 − y),(18)

and considering (1 − z) ≈ e−a(x+L) for z → 1 we get the wave function at the vicinity z = 1

as,

φL(x → 0, z → 1) →h(D1N1 + D2N3)e−iκ(x+L) + (D1N2 + D2N4)eiκ(x+L)ie− πκ

Γ(2 − c1)Γ(a1 + b1 − c1)

,

Γ(1 + a1 − c1)Γ(1 + b1 − c1)

7

.

(20)

At the region x > 0, let’s examine the behavior of the wave function in Eq.(16) for the

(x →0, t → 1) and (x →∞, t → 0) cases. In case of x → 0 (t → 1), using Eq.(18) and

considering (1 − t) ≈ ea(x−L) we have,

φR(x → 0) →h(D3M1 + D4M3)eiκ(x−L) + (D3M2 + D4M4)e−iκ(x−L)ie− πκ

a ,

with the following relations:

M1 = N1, M2 = N2, M3 = N3, M4 = N4.

(21)

(22)

In case of x →∞ (t → 0), t ≈ e−a(x−L) and 2F1[a, b, c; 0] = 1. As a result we obtain the

reﬂected and transmitted waves as follows:

φR(x → ∞, t → 0) →hD3e−ik(x−L)(−1)ν + D4eik(x−L)ie− πκ

a .

(23)

Since the potential at the inﬁnity is not deﬁnded, the term D3 should be zero and we have

only transmitted waves for x → ∞.

Since our model potential has a discontinuity due to the Heaviside step functions, we

have to use the continuity conditions: At x = 0, φL(x = 0) = φR(x = 0) and d

dx φL(x = 0) =

d

dx φR(x = 0) should be satisﬁed. Therefore we get,

D1N1 + D2N3 − D4M3 = (D4M4 − D1N2 − D2N4)e2iκL,

(24)

D1N1 + D2N3 + D4M3 = (D4M4 − D1N2 + D2N4)e2iκL.

Taking Ni = Mi and i = 1, 2, 3, 4 in Eqs. (20) and (22) into account, and solving Eq.(24),

we obtain

It is known that the reﬂected and transmitted coeﬃcients are deﬁned by R = Jref l.

where the probability density function ρ(x, t) = φ(x)∗φ(x) = |φ(x)|2. The reﬂection and

transmission coeﬃcients of the wave function with Eq.(27) are obtained as R = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
T =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(30)

In order to take into account N ∗

1 = N4 and N ∗

2 = N3, we can analytically obtain R + T = 1.

We would like to construct a condition for transmission resonance i.e., T = 1 and R = 0 [2].

In order to satisfy the resonance transmission in the transition coeﬃcient equation, Eq.(30),

the square-bracketed term in the denominator should be equal to two. Therefore we have,

sin(4κL) = −

i

2" (N1N3)2 − (N2N4)2

N1N2N3N4

#.

(31)

It can be seen that the resonance condition depends on the potential parameters

(V0, W0, L, a) and incident energy of the particle (Es). In Fig.(2), the reﬂection and trans-

mission coeﬃcients are plotted as a function of incident particle energy Es and the depth

parameters V0 and W0. The HB of the potential is 22.5 M eV for the parameters V0 = 100
M eV , W0 = 250 M eV , L = 6 f m and a = 1 f m−1. Therefore, as the incident energy of

the particle is very low, there is a total reﬂection (R = 1 and T = 0) in Fig.(2). In calcula-

tion we cannot obtain any transmission resonance for low energy or at zero energy for any

potential parameters. Increasing incident energy of the particle, the resonances begin to be

observed in Fig.(2). At the resonance energy, the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients

have extremum values and their minimum and maximum values are 0 and 1, respectively.

First resonance energy is Es = 15.4913 M eV which can be obtained using Eq.(31). Other

resonance energies are 30.6153 M eV and 50.37 M eV . In case of Es >> HB, increasing the

incident energy of the particle, the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients become 0 and 1,

9

respectively, in Fig.(2). On the bottom of Fig.(2) we present dependencies of the reﬂection

and transmission coeﬃcients on depths of the potential V0 and W0. The HB changes with

V0 and W0. We also plot variation of the HB with V0 and W0 parameters in Fig.(2)(bottom

panel). In order to have the HB, it should be noted that it is W0 > V0. This case is ex-

plicitly shown in Fig.(2). The maximum and minimum of the reﬂection and transmission

coeﬃcients depending on V0 and W0 parameters are apparently seen in Fig.(2). These max-

imum and minimum can also be calculated by using Eq.(31). For very small V0 values the

reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients are 1 and 0, respectively. But decreasing of height

of the barrier with increasing V0, the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients go to 0 and 1,

respectively, in Fig.(2) (left-bottom panel). At the minimum of the HB, the reﬂection and

transmission coeﬃcients are 0 and 1 as expected. For very small values of W0 the reﬂection

and transmission coeﬃcients are 0 and 1 respectively since there is a very small barrier in

Fig.(2) (right-bottom panel). As the HB increase with increasing W0, the reﬂection and

transmission coeﬃcients go to 1 and 0, respectively, in Fig.(2) (right-bottom panel).

In

Fig.(3) we also plot variation of the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients as a function

of a and L parameters in case of the incident energies are lower than the HB (Es < HB)

and higher than the HB (Es > HB). The maximum and minimum values of the reﬂection

and transmission coeﬃcients can be calculated by using Eq.(31) for variation of a and L

parameters.

B. The Bound States

In the bound states, the particle is inside the potential well and the energy of the particle

is quantized as well as Eb

n < 0. Therefore we have kn ≡q− 2mEb

2

n

and κn ≡q 2m

2 (Eb

n + V0).

At the x < 0 and x > 0 regions, the wave functions are equal to Eq.(12) and Eq.(16)

respectively, with µ ≡ kn

a and ν ≡ iκn
a .

Let’s examine the asymptotic behavior of the wave function at x < 0 region in Eq.(12)

for x → −∞ (z → 0). In this limit case z ≈ ea(x+L). Therefore we have,

φL(x → −∞, z → 0) → D1ekn(x+L)(eiπν) + D2e−kn(x+L)(eiπν).

(32)

In case of bound states, the wave function should be zero for x → −∞ (z → 0) in Eq.(32).

Therefore second term in Eq.(32) should be zero in order to satisfy the boundary condition

10

at x < 0, i.e., D2 = 0. As a result, the wave function at x < 0 is

φL(z) = D1zµ(z − 1)ν

2F1(a, b, c; z).

(33)

For the case of x → 0 (z → 1), we have to investigate the behavior of the hypergeometric

function by using the relation Eq.(18) and taking (1 − z) ≈ e−a(x+L), we get,

φL(x → 0, z → 1) →hD1N1e−iκn(x+L) + D1N2eiκn(x+L)ie−

πκn
a ,

(34)

where N1 and N2 are given in Eq.(20). At x > 0 region, we have to examine asymptotic

behavior of the wave function for bound states in Eq.(16). In case of x → 0 (t → 1), by

using Eq.(18) and taking (1 − t) ≈ ea(x−L) into account, we obtain,

φR(x → 0, t → 1) →h(D3M1 + D4M3)eiκn(x−L) + (D3M2 + D4M4)e−iκn(x−L)ie−

πκn
a , (35)

where M1, M2, M3 and M4 are given in Eq.(22). For the case of x → +∞ (t → 0),
considering t ≈ e−a(x−L) and 2F1(a, b, c; 0) = 1, we have

φR(x → ∞, t → 0) →hD3e−kn(x−L)(−1)ν + D4ekn(x−L)ie−

πκn
a .

(36)

In this equation second term does not satisfy the boundary condition i.e., φR(x → ∞, t →

0) = 0. Therefore D4 should be zero in Eq.(36).

The left φL(x) and right φR(x) wave functions should be continuous at x = 0. Before we

apply the continuity condition, we present the latest form of the left φL(x) and right φR(x)

wave functions. Taking D4 = 0 in Eq. (35) and N1 = M1 and N2 = M2 in Eq.(22), we have

φL(x → 0) →hD1N1e−iκn(x+L) + D1N2eiκn(x+L)ie−
φR(x → 0) →hD3N1eiκn(x−L) + D3N2e−iκn(x−L)ie−

πκn
a ,

By using the continuity conditions φL(0) = φR(0), we get

and using d

dx φL(x = 0) = d

dx φR(x = 0) we obtain,

(D1 − D3)(cid:2)N1e−iκnL + N2eiκnL(cid:3) = 0,

The GSWS potential in one dimension has a symmetry under the space transformations

x → −x. Therefore we have even and odd solution for Eq.(38) and Eq.(39).

In Fig.(4), we present the even and odd wave functions of the bound states for some energy

eigenvalues by using Eqs.(40, 41) and Eq.(42) for even solutions as well as Eqs.(43, 44) and

Eq.(45) for odd solutions. We calculate the energy eigenvalues and corresponding wave func-

tions of the GSWS potential for the given parameters which are V0 = 100 M eV , W0 = 250

M eV , L = 6 f m, a = 1 f m−1, mc2 = 940 M eV and c = 197.329 M eV.f m. In these pa-

rameters we can only obtain four energy eigenvalues Eb

n=1 = −93.138 M eV , Eb

n=2 = −67.307

M eV , Eb

n=3 = −34.725 M eV , Eb

n=4 = −0.125 M eV which satisfy the boundary conditions

for even solutions, respectively. Similarly we show that only three energy eigenvalues can

12

be obtained Eb

n=4 = −17.330 M eV which
satisfy the boundary conditions for odd solutions, respectively. The number of eigenvalues

n=2 = −81.403 M eV , Eb

n=3 = −51.567 M eV , Eb

depends on the parameters, namely V0, W0, L and a. One can ﬁnd diﬀerent eigenvalues

with diﬀerent parameters that we choose. The higher quantum numbers n do not satisfy

the boundary condition of the bound states due to the positive energy. In order to obtain

more solution for higher quantum numbers we have to determine boundary condition of

the particle for Eb

n > 0, namely we investigate quasi-bound state solution of the GSWS

potential.

C. The Quasi-Bound States

In this case, the particle is inside the quantum well, but it has positive and complex

energy eigenvalues, namely Eqb

n ≡ Er − iEi and Er >> Ei. By using Eq.(17) we determine

the wave function for x → −∞ (z → 0) as

φL(x → −∞, z → 0) → D2e−ikn(x+L)e−

n + V0). In Eq.(17) we take D1 = 0 since we have

φR(x → ∞, t → 0) → D4eikn(x−L)e−

πκn
a .

(47)

In this case we have only outgoing wave that goes to positive inﬁnity, namely D3 = 0. In

continuum states we already obtain the behavior of the wave functions φL(x) and φR(x) at

the vicinity x → 0 (z → 1) and x → 0 (t → 1) in Eq.(19) and in Eq.(21). Considering

D1 = 0, D3 = 0 and N3 = M3 as well as N4 = M4, we get,

φL(x → 0) →h(D2N3)e−iκn(x+L) + (D2N4)eiκn(x+L)ie−
φR(x → 0) →h(D4N3)eiκn(x−L) + (D4N4)e−iκn(x−L)ie−

Applying the continuity conditions at x = 0, we obtain,

(D2 + D4)hN3e−iκnL − N4eiκnLi = 0.

The quasi-bound energy eigenvalues of the GSWS potential are same with bound state

energy eigenvalues for E<0. Namely, the boundary condition of the quasi-bound state

satisﬁes the boundary condition of bound states. By using the potential parameters in

bound state calculation, we obtain the bound state energy eigenvalues and wave functions

in terms of Eqs.(52, 53) and Eq.(54) for even solutions and Eqs.(55, 56) and Eq.(57) for odd

solutions. In case of even solutions, for n = 5 there are no bound and quasi-bound states

since En=5 = 28.6791 − i4.24688 M eV and the particle energy has bigger energy value than

the potential barrier (HB = 22.5 M eV ) and scattering occurs. In case of odd solutions, the

14

particle has the quasi-bound energy which is Eqb

n=5 = 15.431 − i0.532349 M eV for n = 5. It

should be noted as the particle coming from left of the potential barrier has incident energy

Es = 15.431 M eV , the ﬁrst resonance occurs and the wave function of the particle is totally

transmitted left side of the potential barrier in Fig.2. In order to obtain quasi-bound states

for both even and odd solutions we increase depth of the potential barrier as W0 = 450 M eV

by holding other terms constant. The energy eigenvalues of the quasi-bound states both even
and odd solutions are Eqb

n=5 = 20.0801 − i0.00137933 M eV and Eqb

n=5 = 40.9262 − i0.0648113

M eV , respectively. The resonances occur, when the energies of the particle coming from

left of the potential barrier have incident energies as Es = 20.0801 M eV or Es = 40.9262

M eV . We obtain these energies by using Eq.(31). As a result, while the energies of incident

particle is equal to the quasi-bound state energy for any n quantum number, the transmission

resonance occurs. In Fig.(5), we show the even and odd wave functions of the particle in

case of the quasi-bound states. In Fig.(5), the left and right panels show even and odd wave

functions for the real and imaginary part of the energy eigenvalues of the particle.

III. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have presented the exact analytical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation

for the GSWS potential. We have examined the scattering, bound and quasi-bound states of

the GSWS potential and obtained the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients in case of the

scattering states, even and odd energy eigenvalues and corresponding wave functions in case

of bound states as well as quasi-bound states. We have analytically shown that sum of the

reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients is equal to one. We have analytically obtained the res-

onance condition and also investigated the correlations between the reﬂection-transmission

coeﬃcients and the potential parameters by considering whether the incident energy of the

particle is bigger than the potential barrier or not. Then, we have analytically obtained the

energy eigenvalues and corresponding even and odd wave functions for bound states. There-

after, we have considered that the particle is inside of the potential well but has positive

energy and applied the quantum boundary conditions as well as obtained the quasi-bound

state energies of the particle and corresponding even-odd wave functions. We have shows

that while the incident energy of the particle is equal to one of the quasi-bound state energies

of the potential, there is no reﬂection and particle is totally transmitted from left to right

15

side of the potential barrier. However, we could not obtain transmission resonance at low or

zero incident energy of the particle for any potential parameter, namely we did not observe

supercriticality for GSWS potential in non relativistic regime.

The GSWS potential model used in this paper would be useful model in order to describe

scattering states of the quantum particle, which are elastic scattering, fusion etc., bound

states and quasi-bound states which are the decay of quantum particle.
