CLASSIFYING BICROSSED PRODUCTS OF TWO TAFT ALGEBRAS

A. L. AGORE

Abstract. We classify all Hopf algebras which factorize through two Taft algebras
n2 (q) and respectively Tm2 (q). To start with, all possible matched pairs between the
T
two Taft algebras are described: if q 6= qn−1 then the matched pairs are in bijection with
the group of d-th roots of unity in k, where d = (m, n) while if q = qn−1 then besides
the matched pairs above we obtain an additional family of matched pairs indexed by
k∗. The corresponding bicrossed products are explicitly described by generators and
relations and classiﬁed. As a consequence of our approach, we are able to compute the
number of isomorphism types of these bicrossed products as well as to describe their
automorphism groups.

Introduction

The factorization problem originates in group theory and it was ﬁrst considered by
Maillet ([11]). Since then, it was also introduced and intensively studied in the context
of other mathematical objects such as: (co)algebras ([6]), Lie algebras ([15]), Lie groups
([12]), groupoids ([4]), Hopf algebras ([14]) and so on. For a detailed historical update
on the problem we refer to [2, 3] and the references therein. The factorization problem in
its original group setting asks for the description and classiﬁcation of all groups X which
factorize through two given groups G and H, i.e X = GH and G ∩ H = {1}. However,
although the statement of the problem is very simple and natural, no major progress has
been made so far as we still lack exhaustive methods to tackle it. For instance, even the
description and classiﬁcation of groups which factorize through two ﬁnite cyclic groups
is still an open problem although there are several papers dealing with it, such as the
four papers by J. Douglas [7] and the more recent one [1] which solves completely the
problem in the special case when one of the groups is of prime order.

One turning point in studying the factorization problem for groups was the bicrossed
product construction introduced in a paper by Zappa ([18]); later on, the same con-
struction appears in a paper of Takeuchi [16] where the terminology bicrossed product
originates. The main ingredients in constructing bicrossed products are the so-called
matched pairs of groups. The corresponding notions in the context of Hopf algebras (see
Section 1 for the precise deﬁnitions) were introduced by Majid ([13]) and allowed for a

more computational approach of the problem. This point of view was also considered
recently in [2] where a strategy for classifying bicrossed products of Hopf algebras was
proposed. The line of inquiry presented in [2] was followed in [5] where the Hopf algebras
which factorize through two Sweedler’s Hopf algebras are described and classiﬁed as well
as in [9] where the automorphism group of the Drinfel’d double of a purely non-abelian
ﬁnite group is completely described. Similar ideas are also employed in [10] in order to
determine all quasitriangular structures and ribbon elements on the Drinfel’d double of
a ﬁnite group over an arbitrary ﬁeld.

In this paper, using the method presented in [2], we investigate Hopf algebras which
n2(q). More precisely,
factorize through two Taft algebras Tm2(q) and respectively T
we will describe and classify all bicrossed products Tm2(q) ⊲⊳ T
n2(q). The number of
isomorphism types of these bicrossed products is also computed and, as expected, it
depends heavily on the arithmetics of the base ﬁeld k. In particular, for m = n and

q = qn−1, we discover the celebrated Drinfel’d double D(cid:0)Tn2(q)(cid:1) which however is just

one of the bicrossed products between two Taft algebras having the same dimension.
As a consequence of our strategy the automorphism groups of all bicrossed products
n2(q) are explicitly described. We mention as well that the problem of
Tm2(q) ⊲⊳ T
describing the automorphism group of a given Hopf algebra is a notoriously diﬃcult
problem coming from invariant theory.

The paper is organized as follows. In Preliminaries we review the construction of the
bicrossed product associated to a matched pair of Hopf algebras (A, H, ⊳, ⊲). Then,
we state Majid’s result (Theorem 1.1) which turns the factorization problem for Hopf
algebras into a computational one: given A and H two Hopf algebras, describe the set
of all matched pairs (A, H, ⊲, ⊳) and classify up to an isomorphism all bicrossed products
A ⊲⊳ H. Section 2 gathers our main results. We start by describing all matched pairs
n2(q), Tm2(q), ⊲, ⊳) in Theorem 2.1. It turns out that if q 6= qn−1 then the matched
(T
pairs are in bijection with the group of d-th roots of unity in k, where d = (m, n);
if q = qn−1, then besides the matched pairs above we obtain an additional family of
matched pairs indexed by k∗. The bicrossed products corresponding to the two families
of matched pairs from Theorem 2.1 which we denote by T σ
n, m(q, q) and respectively
Qα
n(q), for some σ ∈ Ud(k) and α ∈ k∗, are described by generators and relations in
Corollary 2.2. Our main classiﬁcation result is Theorem 2.3 which gives necessary and
n2(q) and Tm2 (q) to be
suﬃcient conditions for any two bicrossed products between T
isomorphic. Several cases need to be considered depending on whether n 6= m or m = n
and respectively q 6= q or q = q. In particular, it is proved that the Drinfel’d double

D(cid:0)Tn2(q)(cid:1) is isomorphic to Q1

n(q).

Theorem 2.3 has two very important consequences. The ﬁrst one is Corollary 2.5 which
records the number of isomorphism types of the Hopf algebras described in Corollary 2.2
while the second one, Theorem 2.6, describes explicitly their automorphism groups. For

instance the automorphism group of the Drinfel’d double D(cid:0)Tn2(q)(cid:1) is proved to be

isomorphic to k∗ for n > 3 and to a semidirect product k∗ ⋊ Z2 for n = 2 (see also [5]).

1. Preliminaries

Throughout this paper, k will be an arbitrary ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, all algebras, coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, tensor products and homo-
morphisms are over k. For a coalgebra C, we use Sweedler’s Σ-notation: ∆(c) = c(1)⊗c(2),
(I ⊗ ∆)∆(c) = c(1) ⊗ c(2) ⊗ c(3), etc (summation understood). If C is a coalgebra, the
opposite coalgebra, C cop, has the same underlaying vector space C but with the comul-
tiplication given by ∆cop = τ ◦ ∆, where τ is the ﬂip map τ (a ⊗ b) = b ⊗ a. Given any
vector space V we denote by V ∗ its dual space; if v ∈ V , then the corresponding element
of V ∗ will be denoted simply by v∗. The notation δi, j stands for the Kronecker delta.
For an integer n we denote by Un(k) = {ω ∈ k | ωn = 1} the cyclic group of n-th roots
of unity in k.
If |Un(k)| = n, then any generator of Un(k) is called a primitive n-th
root of unity; we will denote by Pn(k) the set of all primitive n-th roots of unity. It is
straightforward to see that if m 6= n then Pm(k) ∩ Pm(k) = ∅. For any two positive
integers m and n, we will denote their greatest common divisor by (m, n).
Given a ﬁxed positive integer m ∈ N∗ and q a primitive m-th root of unity in k we will
denote by Tm2(q) the Taft Hopf algebra of order m2. Recall that Tm2 (q) is generated
as an algebra by two elements h and x subject to the relations hm = 1, xm = 0 and
xh = qhx. The coalgebra structure is as follows: h is a group like element while x is
(h, 1)-primitive. That is, the comultiplication, counit and respectively antipode are given
by:

∆(h) = h ⊗ h, ∆(x) = x ⊗ h + 1 ⊗ x, ǫ(h) = 1,
ǫ(x) = 0, S(h) = h−1, S(x) = −xh−1

Sweedler’s Hopf algebra is obtained by considering m = 2 and q = −1. It is well known
that {hixj}0≤i, j≤m−1 is a k-linear basis of the Taft algebra, the set of group-like elements

is G(cid:0)Tm2(q)(cid:1)= {1, h, h2, · · · , hn−1} and the primitive elements Phj , 1(cid:0)Tm2(q)(cid:1) are given

as follows for any j = {0, 1, · · · , m − 1} (see for instance [17]):

Phj , 1(cid:0)Tm2(q)(cid:1)= (cid:26)

α(hj − 1),
β(h − 1) + γx,

if
if

j 6= 1
j = 1

, for some α, β, γ ∈ k.

Also, it is worth pointing out that two Taft algebras Tm2(q) and respectively Tm2(q′)
are isomorphic as Hopf algebras if and only if q = q′. Furthermore, we also have a
Hopf algebra isomorphism ψ : Tm2(q) → Tm2(q)∗ deﬁned as follows for any i, j ∈
{0, 1, · · · , m − 1}:

ψ(h) = h∗, ψ(x) = x∗

h∗(hixj) = qiδj, 0, x∗(hixj) = δj, 1.

(1)

Another trivial remark which will be useful in the sequel is that the antipode of the Taft
algebra provides an isomorphism of Hopf algebras between Tm2(q)cop and Tm2(qn−1).
Since we will be working with two Taft algebras (sometimes having the same dimension)
n2(q) where
in order to avoid any confusion the second Taft algebra will be denoted by T

q ∈ Pn(k), and by H and X its generators. Therefore, H n = 1, X n = 0, XH = qHX,
H is a group-like element while X is an (H, 1)-primitive element.

Bicrossed product of Hopf algebras. We recall brieﬂy the main characters of this
paper, namely the bicrossed products of Hopf algebras. We will adopt the terminology
bicrossed product from [8, Theorem IX 2.3] as it is also employed for the analogous con-
struction performed at the level of groups [16]; other term referring to this construction
used in the literature is double cross product [13, Proposition 3.12]. A matched pair of
Hopf algebras is a system (A, H, ⊳, ⊲), where A and H are Hopf algebras, ⊳ : H ⊗ A → H,
⊲ : H ⊗ A → A are coalgebra maps such that (A, ⊲) is a left H-module coalgebra, (H, ⊳)
is a right A-module coalgebra and the following compatibilities hold for any a, b ∈ A, g,
h ∈ H.

h ⊲ 1A = εH (h)1A,

1H ⊳ a = εA(a)1H

g ⊲ (ab) = (g(1) ⊲ a(1))(cid:0)(g(2) ⊳ a(2)) ⊲ b(cid:1)
(gh) ⊳ a = (cid:0)g ⊳ (h(1) ⊲ a(1))(cid:1)(h(2) ⊳ a(2))

g(1) ⊳ a(1) ⊗ g(2) ⊲ a(2) = g(2) ⊳ a(2) ⊗ g(1) ⊲ a(1)

(2)
(3)

(4)

(5)

Recall that H is called a right A-module coalgebra if H is a coalgebra in the monoidal
category MA of right A-modules, i.e.
there exists ⊳ : H ⊗ A → H a morphism of
coalgebras such that (H, ⊳) is a right A-module. For further computations, the fact that
two k-linear maps ⊳ : H ⊗ A → H, ⊲ : H ⊗ A → A are coalgebra maps can be written
explicitly as follows:

∆H(h ⊳ a) = h(1) ⊳ a(1) ⊗ h(2) ⊳ a(2),
∆A(h ⊲ a) = h(1) ⊲ a(1) ⊗ h(2) ⊲ a(2),

εA(h ⊳ a) = εH (h)εA(a)
εA(h ⊲ a) = εH (h)εA(a)

(6)

(7)

for all h ∈ H, a ∈ A. The actions ⊳ : H ⊗ A → H, ⊲ : H ⊗ A → A are called trivial if
h ⊳ a = εA(a)h and respectively h ⊲ a = εH (h)a, for all a ∈ A and h ∈ H.
If (A, H, ⊳, ⊲) is a matched pair of Hopf algebras, the bicrossed product A ⊲⊳ H of A with
H is the k-module A ⊗ H with the multiplication given by

(a ⊲⊳ h) · (c ⊲⊳ g) := a(h(1) ⊲ c(1)) ⊲⊳ (h(2) ⊳ c(2))g

(8)

for all a, c ∈ A, h, g ∈ H, where we denoted a ⊗ h by a ⊲⊳ h. A ⊲⊳ H is a Hopf algebra
with the coalgebra structure given by the tensor product of coalgebras and the antipode:

SA⊲⊳H (a ⊲⊳ h) = SH(h(2)) ⊲ SA(a(2)) ⊲⊳ SH(h(1)) ⊳ SA(a(1))

(9)

for all a ∈ A and h ∈ H.

The generic example of a bicrossed product is the Drinfel’d double D(H). For any ﬁnite
dimensional Hopf algebra H we have a matched pair of Hopf algebras ((H ∗)cop, H, ⊳, ⊲),
where the actions ⊳ and ⊲ are given as follows:

h ⊳ h∗ := hh∗, S−1

H (h(3))h(1)ih(2),

(10)
for all h ∈ H and h∗ ∈ H ∗ ([8, Theorem IX.3.5]). The Drinfel’d double of H is the
bicrossed product associated to this matched pair, i.e. D(H) = (H ∗)cop ⊲⊳ H. A
generalization of this construction for inﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebras was introduced
by Majid under the name of generalized quantum double (see ([13, Example 7.2.6])).

h ⊲ h∗ := hh∗, S−1

H (h(2)) ? h(1)i

A Hopf algebra E factorizes through two Hopf algebras A and H if there exists injective
Hopf algebra maps i : A → E and j : H → E such that the map

A ⊗ H → E,

a ⊗ h 7→ i(a)j(h)

is bijective. The next crucial result due to Majid [14, Theorem 7.2.3] characterizes Hopf
algebras which factorize through two Hopf subalgebras in terms of matched pairs and
the corresponding bicrossed products.

Theorem 1.1. Let A, H be two Hopf algebras. A Hopf algebra E factorizes through A
and H if and only if there exists a matched pair of Hopf algebras (A, H, ⊳, ⊲) such that
E ∼= A ⊲⊳ H, an isomorphism of Hopf algebras.

Our approach for classifying bicrossed products of Hopf algebras relies on the strat-
egy previously developed in [2]. For the reader’s convenience we state here the main
classiﬁcation result from [2] which will be used throughout:

Theorem 1.2. Let (A, H, ⊲, ⊳) and (A′, H ′, ⊲′, ⊳′) be two matched pairs of Hopf algebras.
Then there exists a bijective correspondence between the set of all morphisms of Hopf
algebras ψ : A ⊲⊳ H → A′ ⊲⊳′ H ′ and the set of all quadruples (u, p, r, v), where u : A →
A′, p : A → H ′, r : H → A′, v : H → H ′ are unitary coalgebra maps satisfying the
following compatibility conditions:

u(a(1)) ⊗ p(a(2)) = u(a(2)) ⊗ p(a(1))
r(g(1)) ⊗ v(g(2)) = r(g(2)) ⊗ v(g(1))

u(ab) = u(a(1))(cid:0)p(a(2)) ⊲′ u(b)(cid:1)
p(ab) = (cid:0)p(a) ⊳′ u(b(1))(cid:1) p(b(2))
r(tg) = r(t(1))(cid:0)v(t(2)) ⊲′ r(g)(cid:1)
v(tg) = (cid:0)v(t) ⊳′ r(g(1))(cid:1) v(g(2))

r(g(1))(cid:0)v(g(2)) ⊲′ u(b)(cid:1) = u(g(1) ⊲ b(1))(cid:16)p(g(2) ⊲ b(2)) ⊲′ r(g(3) ⊳ b(3))(cid:17)
(cid:0)v(g) ⊳′ u(b(1))(cid:1) p(b(2)) = (cid:16)p(g(1) ⊲ b(1)) ⊳′ r(g(2) ⊳ b(2))(cid:17) v(g(3) ⊳ b(3))

for all a, b ∈ A, g, t ∈ H.
Under the above correspondence the morphism of Hopf algebras ψ : A ⊲⊳ H → A′ ⊲⊳′ H ′
corresponding to (u, p, r, v) is given by:

ψ(a ⊲⊳ g) = u(a(1))(cid:0)p(a(2)) ⊲′ r(g(1))(cid:1) ⊲⊳′ (cid:0)p(a(3)) ⊳′ r(g(2))(cid:1) v(g(3))

for all a ∈ A and h ∈ H.

(19)

The following straightforward result will prove to be very eﬀective in computing matched
pairs of Hopf algebras.

Lemma 1.3. Let (A, H, ⊳, ⊲) be a matched pair of Hopf algebras, a, b ∈ G(A) and g,
h ∈ G(H). Then:

(1) g ⊲ a ∈ G(A) and g ⊳ a ∈ G(H);

(2) If x ∈ Pa, 1(A), then g ⊳ x ∈ Pg⊳a, g(H) and g ⊲ x ∈ Pg⊲a, 1(A);
(3) If y ∈ Pg, 1(H), then y ⊳ a ∈ Pg⊳a, 1(H) and y ⊲ a ∈ Pg⊲a, a(A).

2. The bicrossed products of two Taft algebras

This section contains our main results. We start by describing all possible matched pairs
between two Taft algebras.

Theorem 2.1. Let m, n ∈ N∗ \ {1}, d = (m, n) and q ∈ Pm(k), q ∈ Pn(k).

1) If q 6= qn−1 then there is a bijective correspondence between the matched pairs
n2(q), Tm2 (q), ⊲, ⊳) and Ud(k) such that the matched pair corresponding to the

(T
d-th root of unity σ is given as follows:

⊳ H X
h
0
x σx 0

h

⊲ H X
h H σX
x 0
0

2) If q = qn−1 then in addition to the matched pair depicted above we also have the

following matched pair for any α ∈ k∗:

⊳ H
h
h
x qx α(1 − h)

X
0

⊲ H
h H
x 0 α(1 − H)

X
qX

Proof. Let (T
T

n2(q) → T

n2(q), Tm2(q), ⊲, ⊳) be a matched pair of Hopf algebras, where ⊲ : Tm2(q) ⊗
n2(q) → Tm2(q). We will start by proving that h⊲H =

n2(q) and ⊳ : Tm2(q)⊗T

n2(q)(cid:1)= {1, H, · · · , H n−1}. It

H. First, notice that by Lemma 1.3 we have h ⊲ H ∈ G(cid:0)T

n2(q) is a left Tm2(q)-
is easy to see that h ⊲ H 6= 1; indeed, if h ⊲ H = 1 then since T
module via ⊲ we would obtain H = hm ⊲ H = 1 which is a contradiction. Therefore,
h ⊲ H = H t with t ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n − 1}. Suppose h ⊲ H = H t with t 6= 1. Then using
n2(q)) so h ⊲ X = α(1 − H t). By induction
again Lemma 1.3 we obtain h ⊲ X ∈ PH t, 1(T
we obtain X = hm ⊲ X = α(1 − H tm ) for some tm ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1} and we have
n2(q))
reached a contradiction. Thus we need to have h ⊲ H = H and h ⊲ X ∈ PH, 1(T
hence h ⊲ X = a(1 − H) + bX for some a, b ∈ k. Furthermore, this leads us to x ⊲ H ∈
n2(q)
Ph⊲H, H(T
is in particular a coalgebra map we have:

n2(q)), i.e. x⊲H = 0. Now since ⊲ : Tm2(q)⊗ T

n2(q)) = PH, H (T

n2(q) → T

∆(x ⊲ X)

(7)
= x(1) ⊲ X(1) ⊗ x(2) ⊲ X(2)
= x ⊲ X ⊗ h ⊲ H + x ⊲ 1 ⊗ h ⊲ X + 1 ⊲ X ⊗ x ⊲ H + 1 ⊲ 1 ⊗ x ⊲ X
= x ⊲ X ⊗ H + 1 ⊗ x ⊲ X

n2(q)), i.e. x ⊲ X = α(1 − H) + βX for some α, β ∈ k.

thus x ⊲ X ∈ PH, 1(T
Now we check under what conditions the two actions are compatible with the relations
satisﬁed by the generators of the two Taft algebras. To start with, it is obvious that
xm⊲H = 0. By induction one can easily prove that hi⊲X = a(1+b+· · ·+bi−1)(1−H)+biX
for all i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , m}. As hm = 1 we get:

bm = 1,

a(1 + b + · · · + bm−1) = 0

(20)

CLASSIFYING BICROSSED PRODUCTS OF TWO TAFT ALGEBRAS

7

Furthermore, we have:

xh ⊲ X = bα − bαH + bβX
qhx ⊲ X = q(α + aβ) − q(α + aβ)H + qbβX

which yields

q(α + aβ) = bα,

qbβ = bβ

As q 6= 1 we obtain bβ = 0 and since bm = 1 it follows that β = 0. Finally, one can now
easily check that xm ⊲ X = 0. To summarize, so far we obtained:

h ⊲ H = H, x ⊲ H = 0, x ⊲ X = α(1 − H), h ⊲ X = a(1 − H) + bX

where bm = 1, α(q − b) = 0 and a(1 + b + · · · + bm−1) = 0.
In the same manner, it can be proved that (Tm2 (q), ⊳) is a right T
if and only if:

n2(q) - module coalgebra

h ⊳ H = h, h ⊳ X = 0, x ⊳ X = µ(1 − h), x ⊳ H = γ(1 − h) + σx

where σn = 1, µ(1 − qσ) = 0, γ(1 + σ + · · · + σn−1) = 0.
Next we impose (3) and (4) to be fulﬁlled by the pairs (⊲, ⊳) depicted above. To start
with, we can easily prove by induction that hm ⊳ H = hm and hm ⊳ X = 0 which are
trivially fulﬁlled since hm = 1. We also have:

xh ⊳ H = γh − γh2 + σxh
qhx ⊳ H = qγh − qγh2 + qσhx

which by (4) implies γ = qγ and since q 6= 1 we get γ = 0. Furthermore, the following
identities:

xh ⊳ X = bµh − bµh2 + (a − aσ)xh
qhx ⊳ X = qµh − qµh2

yield a(σ − 1) = 0 and µ(b − q) = 0. Finally, by induction, we obtain xm ⊳ H = σmxm
which is again trivially fulﬁlled since xm = 0.
We move on to checking (3). Again by induction we obtain h ⊲ H n = H n and x ⊲ H n = 0,
equalities trivially fulﬁlled since H n = 1. Now from the following equalities:

h ⊲ XH = aH − aH 2 + bqHX
h ⊲ qHX = qaH − qaH 2 + bqHX

we obtain qa = a and since q 6= 1 we get a = 0. Finally, the following equalities:

x ⊲ XH = αH − αH 2
x ⊲ qHX = qασH − qασH 2

yield α(1 − σq) = 0.

We arrived at the last compatibility condition, namely (5). For the pairs (h, H), (h, X)
and (x, H) the aforementioned compatibility is trivially fulﬁlled. We are left to check

8

A. L. AGORE

(5) for the pair (x, X). In this case it comes down to the following:

x ⊳ X ⊗ h ⊲ H + x ⊳ 1 ⊗ h ⊲ X + 1 ⊳ X ⊗ x ⊲ H + 1 ⊳ 1 ⊗ x ⊲ X =
h ⊳ H ⊗ x ⊲ X + h ⊳ X ⊗ x ⊲ 1 + x ⊳ H ⊗ 1 ⊲ X + x ⊳ X ⊗ 1 ⊲ 1

which is equivalent to:

µ(1 − h) ⊗ H + x ⊗ bX + 1 ⊗ α(1 − H) = h ⊗ α(1 − H) + σx ⊗ X + µ(1 − h) ⊗ 1

Therefore, we obtain b = σ and α = µ. Putting all together, we have obtained the
following matched pairs:

h ⊲ H = H, x ⊲ H = 0, x ⊲ X = α(1 − H), h ⊲ X = σX
h ⊳ H = h, h ⊳ X = 0, x ⊳ X = α(1 − h), x ⊳ H = σX

where σn = 1 = σm, α(1 − qσ) = 0, α(σ − q) = 0. We distinguish two cases based
on whether q = q−1 or q 6= q−1. If q 6= q−1 then we can not have both (σ − q) = 0
and (1 − qσ) = 0 so we obtain α = 0. This gives rise to the ﬁrst matched pair in the
statement of our result. Suppose now that q = q−1. To start with, as q ∈ Pn(k) and

q−1 = qm−1 ∈ Pm(k) we obtain q ∈ Pn(k)T Pm(k) which is only possible if m = n. Now,

if α = 0 we obtain again our ﬁrst matched pair while if α 6= 0 we must have σ = q = q−1
and this gives rise to the second matched pair. Although initially we only imposed the
compatibilities conditions deﬁning a matched pair to be fulﬁlled for the generators of the
two Hopf algebras, it can be easily seen now that they are fulﬁlled for any elements. For
example, in the case of the second matched pair whose formula is more complicated, we
have:

xt ⊳ X = α(cid:0)qt−1 + qt−2 + · · · + 1(cid:1)xt−1 − αqt−1(cid:0)qt−1 + qt−2 + · · · + 1(cid:1)hxt−1
x ⊲ X t = α(cid:0)qt−1 + qt−2 + · · · + 1(cid:1)X t−1 − αqt−1(cid:0)qt−1 + qt−2 + · · · + 1(cid:1)HX t−1

for all t ∈ {1, 2, · · · n}. Moreover, one can see that these formulae respect the relations
xn = 0 and X n = 0 from the two Taft algebras just as a simple consequence of the
identity qn−1 + qn−2 + · · · + 1 = 0.
(cid:3)

Having listed all possible matched pairs between two Taft algebras in Theorem 2.1 the
next step in our approach is to describe the corresponding bicrossed products.

Corollary 2.2. Let m, n ∈ N∗ \ {1}, d = (m, n) and q ∈ Pm(k), q ∈ Pn(k).

1) If q 6= qn−1 then a Hopf algebra E factorizes through T

n2(q) and Tm2(q) if and
n, m(q, q) the

Hopf algebra generated by h, x, H and X subject to the relations:

such that h, H are group-like elements, x is an (h, 1)-primitive element, X is an
(H, 1)-primitive element and the antipode is given by:

2) If q = qn−1 then a Hopf algebra E factorizes through T

n2(qn−1) and Tn2(q) if and
n(q) for some α ∈ k∗
n(q) the Hopf algebra generated by h, x, H and X subject

n, n(qn−1, q) for some σ ∈ Un(k) or E ∼= Qα

only if E ∼= T σ
where we denote by Qα
to the relations:
xh = qhx, XH = qn−1HX
hn = H n = 1,
xH = qHx, hX = qXh, xX − qXx = α(1 − Hh), hH = Hh

xn = X n = 0,

such that h, H are group-like elements, x is an (h, 1)-primitive element, X is an
(H, 1)-primitive element and the antipode is given by:

S(h) = hn−1, S(H) = H n−1, S(x) = −qn−1hn−1x, S(X) = −qH n−1X.

Proof. The proof relies on Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 2.1. Suppose ﬁrst that q 6= qn−1.
We will see that T σ
n2(q) ⊲⊳ Tm2 (q) corresponding to
the matched pair described in the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2.1. Indeed, up to canonical
n2(q) ⊲⊳ Tm2(q) is generated as an algebra by X = X ⊲⊳ 1, H = H ⊲⊳ 1,
identiﬁcation, T
x = 1 ⊲⊳ x and h = 1 ⊲⊳ h. Then, we have:

n, m(q, q) is the bicrossed product T

xX = (1 ⊲⊳ x)(X ⊲⊳ 1) = x(1) ⊲ X(1) ⊲⊳ x(2) ⊳ X(2)

= x ⊲ X ⊲⊳ h ⊳ H + x ⊲ 1 ⊲⊳ h ⊳ X + 1 ⊲ X ⊲⊳ x ⊳ H + 1 ⊲ 1 ⊲⊳ x ⊳ X
= X ⊲⊳ σx = σXx

In the same manner it can be proved that hH = Hh, xH = σHx and hX = σXh.
Assume now that q = qn−1. Then, according to Theorem 2.1 we have two families of
matched pairs. The bicrossed product corresponding to the ﬁrst family is just the one
described above. The proof will be ﬁnished once we prove that the bicrossed product
corresponding to the matched pair in Theorem 2.1, 2) coincides with Qα
n(q). Indeed, in
this case we have:

xX = (1 ⊲⊳ x)(X ⊲⊳ 1) = x(1) ⊲ X(1) ⊲⊳ x(2) ⊳ X(2)

= x ⊲ X ⊲⊳ h ⊳ H + x ⊲ 1 ⊲⊳ h ⊳ X + 1 ⊲ X ⊲⊳ x ⊳ H + 1 ⊲ 1 ⊲⊳ x ⊳ X
= α(1 − H) ⊲⊳ h + X ⊲⊳ qx + 1 ⊲⊳ α(1 − h)
= qXx + α(1 − Hh)

xH = (1 ⊲⊳ x)(H ⊲⊳ 1) = x(1)⊲H ⊲⊳ x(2)⊳H = x⊲H ⊲⊳ h⊳H+1⊲H ⊲⊳ x⊳H = H ⊲⊳ qx = qHx
Similarly, one can see that hH = Hh and hX = qXh and the proof is now complete. (cid:3)

We are now in a position to prove our ﬁrst result on the classiﬁcation of Hopf algebras
which factorize through two Taft algebras.

Theorem 2.3. With the above notations we have:

1) If n 6= m or m = n and q 6= q then there exists an isomorphism of Hopf algebras

T σ

n, m(q, q) ∼= T σ′

n, m(q, q) if and only if σ = σ′;

2) If m = n and q = q then there exists an isomorphism of Hopf algebras T σ

n, n(q, q) ∼=

T σ′

n, n(q, q) if and only if σ′ = σ or σ′ = σ−1;

10

3) There exists an isomorphism of Hopf algebras Qα

n(q) ∼= Q1

n(q) for all α ∈ k∗.

Moreover, Q1

n(q) is isomorphic to the Drinfeld double D(cid:0)Tn2(q)(cid:1);
n, n(qn−1, q).

n(q) is not isomorphic to any of the Hopf algebras T σ

4) Q1

n2(q), Tm2(q), ⊲, ⊳) and (T

Proof. We will prove the ﬁrst two statements together. Suppose that T σ
n, m(q, q) and
resppectively T σ′
n, m(q, q) are the bicrossed products corresponding to the matched pairs
n2(q), Tm2(q), ⊲′, ⊳′) implemented by σ and σ′ as in Theo-
(T
rem 2.1, 1). As mentioned before, our approach relies on Theorem 1.2: any Hopf algebra
map ψ : T σ
n, m(q, q) is parameterized by a quadruple (u, p, r, v) consisting
n2(q),
of unital coalgebra maps u : T
v : Tm2(q) → Tm2 (q) satisfying the compatibility conditions (11)-(18). To start with,
since all four maps above are unital coalgebra maps, Lemma 1.3 gives:

n2(q) → Tm2 (q), r : Tm2(q) → T

n, m(q, q) → T σ′

n2(q), p : T

n2(q) → T

u(1) = 1, p(1) = 1, r(1) = 1, v(1) = 1
u(H) = H a, p(H) = hb, r(h) = H c, v(h) = hd

u(X) ∈ PH a, 1(cid:0)T
r(x) ∈ PH c, 1(cid:0)T

n2(q)(cid:1), p(X) ∈ Phb, 1(cid:0)Tm2 (q)(cid:1)
n2(q)(cid:1), v(x) ∈ Phd, 1(cid:0)Tm2 (q)(cid:1)

Applying (11) for a = X yields:

u(X) ⊗ hb + 1 ⊗ p(X) = H a ⊗ p(X) + u(X) ⊗ 1

(21)

I.
II.

Putting together (21) and the fact that u(X) ∈ PH a, 1(cid:0)T
Phb, 1(cid:0)Tm2(q)(cid:1) we obtain the following possibilities for the pair of maps (u, p):

n2(q)(cid:1) and respectively p(X) ∈

u(H) = H, u(X) = α(1 − H), p(H) = h, p(X) = α(1 − h), α ∈ k;
u(H) = H, u(X) = α(1 − H) + βX, p(H) = 1, p(X) = 0, α, β ∈ k;
u(H) = H, u(X) = α(1 − H), p(H) = hb, p(X) = α(1 − hb), α ∈ k, b ∈ N∗ \ {1};
u(H) = 1, u(X) = 0, p(H) = h, p(X) = α(1 − h) + βx, α, β ∈ k;
u(H) = H a, u(X) = α(1 − H a), p(H) = h, p(X) = α(1 − h), α ∈ k, a ∈ N∗ \ {1};
u(H) = 1, u(X) = 0, p(H) = 1, p(X) = 0;

III.
IV.
V.
VI.
VII. u(H) = 1, u(X) = 0, p(H) = hb, p(X) = α(1 − hb), α ∈ k, b ∈ N∗ \ {1};
VIII. u(H) = H a, u(X) = α(1 − H a), p(H) = 1, p(X) = 0, α ∈ k, a ∈ N∗ \ {1};
IX.

u(H) = H a, u(X) = α(1 − H a), p(H) = hb, p(X) = α(1 − hb),
α ∈ k, a, b ∈ N∗ \ {1}.

Now by applying (13) for (a, b) = (X, H) and respectively (a, b) = (H, X) we get:

u(XH) = u(X)H a + p(X) ⊲′ H a

As XH = qHX we obtain:

u(HX) = H a(cid:0)hb ⊲′ u(X)(cid:1)

u(X)H a + p(X) ⊲′ H a = qH a(cid:0)hb ⊲′ u(X)(cid:1)

(22)

CLASSIFYING BICROSSED PRODUCTS OF TWO TAFT ALGEBRAS

11

Analogously, using (14) in the same manner as above yields:

Suppose the maps u, p are given as in I. Then the compatibility condition (22) gives:

(cid:0)p(X) ⊳′ H a(cid:1)hb = q(cid:0)hb ⊳′ u(X)(cid:1)hb + qhbp(X)
α(1 − H)H + α(1 − h) ⊲′ H = qH(cid:0)h ⊲′ α(1 − H)(cid:1)

(23)

which comes down to α = αq and since q 6= 1 we get α = 0. Therefore u(X) = p(X) = 0.
This implies:

ψ(X ⊲⊳ 1) = u(X(1)) ⊲⊳ p(X(2)) = u(X) ⊲⊳ p(H) + u(1) ⊲⊳ p(X) = 0

so in this case ψ is not an isomorphism. Using the same strategy as above, a rather long
but straightforward computation based on the compatibility conditions (22) and (23)
rules out the other cases as well except for the second one and the forth one if m = n
and q = q. Indeed, suppose the maps u, p are given as in II. Then the compatibility
condition (23) is trivially fulﬁlled while (22) gives:

(cid:0)α(1 − H)H + βX(cid:1)H = qH(cid:0)α(1 − H) + βX(cid:1)

which implies α = αq and since q 6= 1 we get α = 0. Thus u(X) = βX and p(H) = 1.
Furthermore, using (13) and (14) we obtain the following general formulas:

u(X j H i) = βj X j H i, where β ∈ k, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}
p(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, for all Y ∈ T

n2(q).

Finally, we discuss the forth case, i.e. the maps u, p are given as in IV. Then (22) is
trivially fulﬁlled while (23) comes down to:

αh − αh2 + βxh = qαh − qαh2 + βqhx

so we get α = 0 and q = q. As we noticed before, q = q also implies m = n. Thus, if
m = n and q = q we can also have:

u(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, for all Y ∈ T
p(X iH j) = ζ iX iH j, where ζ ∈ k, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}.

n2(q)

Next we focus on the maps r and v. To this end, we apply (12) for g = X which yields:

r(x) ⊗ hd + 1 ⊗ v(x) = H c ⊗ v(x) + r(x) ⊗ 1

We have r(x) ∈ PH c, 1(cid:0)T

of the maps u and p but using this time the compatibility conditions (15) and (16). We
obtain:

n2(q)(cid:1) and v(x) ∈ Phd, 1(cid:0)Tm2(q)(cid:1) and we proceed as in the case

r(y) = ǫ(y)1, for all y ∈ Tm2(q)
v(xlht) = ηl xl ht, where η ∈ k, l, t ∈ {0, 1, · · · , m − 1}.

In addition, if q = q (and thus m = n) we also have the following pair of maps (r, v):

r(xlht) = γlxlht, where γ ∈ k, l, t ∈ {0, 1, · · · , m − 1}
v(y) = ǫ(y)1, for all y ∈ Tm2(q).

12

Suppose ﬁrst that m 6= n or m = n and q 6= q. Then, the only quadruple (u, p, r, v)
which might satisfy the compatibility conditions (11)-(18) is given as follows:
u(X j H i) = βj X j H i, where β ∈ k, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}
p(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, for all Y ∈ T
r(y) = ǫ(y)1, for all y ∈ Tm2 (q)
v(xlht) = ηl xl ht, where η ∈ k, l, t ∈ {0, 1, · · · , m − 1}.

n2(q)

and the corresponding Hopf algebra morphism ψ : T σ
n, m(q, q) is given by
n2(q) and g ∈ Tm2(q). First notice that since
ψ(a ⊲⊳ g) = u(a) ⊲⊳ v(g) for any a ∈ T
ψ(X ⊲⊳ 1) = βX ⊲⊳ 1 and ψ(1 ⊲⊳ x) = 1 ⊲⊳ ηx and we want ψ to be an isomorphism we
need to have β, η ∈ k∗.

n, m(q, q) → T σ′

Now considering the way we obtained the maps u, p, r, v listed above it is obvious that
the compatibility conditions (11)-(16) are fulﬁlled. We are left to check the compatibility
conditions (17) and (18) which in this case boil down to:

v(g) ⊲′ u(b) = u(g ⊲ b)
v(g) ⊳′ u(b) = v(g ⊳ b)

(24)
(25)

n2(q). Now considering (g, b) := (h, X) in (24) we obtain
n, m(q, q)

for all g ∈ Tm2 (q), b ∈ T
βσ′X = βσX and since β 6= 0 we must have σ = σ′. To conclude, in this case, T σ
is isomorphic to T σ′
Assume now that m = n and q = q. Then, besides the quadruple listed above which
implies that T σ
n, n(q, q) if and only if σ = σ′, we can also have the following
possibilities:

n, m(q, q) if and only if σ = σ′.

n, n(q, q) ∼= T σ′

u1(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, p1(X iH j) = ζ ixihj, r1(xlht) = γlX lH t, v1(y) = ǫ(y)1;

I.
II. u2(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, p2(X iH j) = ζ ixihj, r2(y) = ǫ(y)1, v2(xlht) = ηlxlht;
III. u3(X j H i) = βj X j H i, p3(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, r3(xlht) = γlX lH t, v3(y) = ǫ(y)1;

where i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}, l, t ∈ {0, 1, · · · , m − 1}, γ, ζ ∈ k∗,
Y ∈ T

n2(q), y ∈ Tn2(q).

Suppose the quadruple (u, p, r, v) is given as in I. Then the compatibility condition (17)
writes:

r1(g)ǫ(b) = p1(cid:0)g(1) ⊲ b(1)(cid:1)⊲′r1(cid:0)g(2) ⊳ b(2)(cid:1)

for all g ∈ Tm2(q), b ∈ T
γX = γσσ′X. If γ = 0 then we get r1(x) = 0 and thus

n2(q). Setting (b, g) = (H, x) in the above equality yields

ψ(1 ⊲⊳ x) = r1(x(1)) ⊲⊳′ v1(x(2)) = r1(x) ⊲⊳′ 1 = 0

Therefore, ψ is not bijective unless γ 6= 0. Hence for T σ
n, n(q, q) to be
isomorphic we need to have σσ′ = 1. Furthermore, it can be easily seen by a straightfor-
ward computation that (18) is also fulﬁlled and ψ is a Hopf algebra isomorphism if and
only if σσ′ = 1.

n, n(q, q) and T σ′

CLASSIFYING BICROSSED PRODUCTS OF TWO TAFT ALGEBRAS

13

If the quadruple (u, p, r, v) is given as in II or III then the corresponding Hopf algebra
map ψ is not an isomorphism. Indeed, assume ﬁrst that (u, p, r, v) is given as in II.
Then, for all a ∈ T

n2(q) and g ∈ Tn2(q) we have:

ψ(a ⊲⊳ g) = ǫ(a(1))(cid:0)p(a(2)) ⊲′ ǫ(g(1))(cid:1) ⊲⊳′ (cid:0)p(a(3)) ⊳′ ǫ(g(2))(cid:1) v(g(3)) = 1 ⊲⊳′ p(a)v(g)

and it is obvious that ψ is not surjective. Similarly, if the quadruple (u, p, r, v) is given
as in III, then for all a ∈ T

n2(q) and g ∈ Tn2(q) we have:

ψ(a ⊲⊳ g) = u(a(1))(cid:0)ǫ(a(2)) ⊲′ r(g(1))(cid:1) ⊲⊳′ (cid:0)ǫ(a(3)) ⊳′ r(g(2))(cid:1) ǫ(g(3)) = u(a)r(g) ⊲⊳′ 1

and as before ψ is again not surjective.
3) Indeed, it is straightforward to see that the k-linear map ϕ : Qα
by:

n(q) → Q1

n(q) deﬁned

ϕ(H) = H, ϕ(h) = h, ϕ(x) = x, ϕ(X) = α−1X

is an isomorphism of Hopf algebras for all α ∈ k∗.

For the second part of the statement, recall that the Drinfel’d double D(cid:0)Tn2(q)(cid:1) fac-
torizes through (cid:0)Tn2(q)∗(cid:1)cop and Tn2(q). Putting together the two Hopf algebra isomor-
phisms Tm2(q)∗ ∼= Tm2 (q) and Tm2(q)cop ∼= Tm2(qn−1) noted in Preliminaries we can
conclude that the Hopf algebras (cid:0)Tn2(q)∗(cid:1)cop and respectively Tn2(qn−1) are also isomor-
phic. Therefore, the Drinfel’d double D(cid:0)Tn2(q)(cid:1) is one of the bicrossed products between
Tn2(qn−1) and Tn2(q). To this end, we compute:

x ⊳ X ∗

(10)

= X ∗(cid:0)S−1(h)x(cid:1)h + X ∗(cid:0)S−1(h)(cid:1)x + X ∗(cid:0)S−1(x)(cid:1)

= X ∗(hn−1x)h + X ∗(−hn−1x)

(1)
= h − 1

We can now conclude that the matched pair which gives the Drinfel’d double coincides
with the matched pair depicted in Theorem 2.1, 2) for α = −1. Since we proved that
the corresponding matched pair, namely Q−1
n(q) the conclusion
follows.
4) We use again Theorem 1.2. Suppose there exists an isomorphism ψ between Q1
n(q) =
n2(q). Based on the ﬁrst part of
T
the proof it follows that ψ is determined by the following quadruple of coalgebra maps:

n (q), is isomorphic to Q1

n2(qn−1) ⊲⊳′ T

n2(qn−1) ⊲⊳ T

n2(q) and T σ

n, n(q, q) = T

u(X j H i) = βj X j H i, where β ∈ k, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}
p(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, for all Y ∈ T
r(y) = ǫ(y)1, for all y ∈ Tm2 (q)
v(xlht) = ηl xl ht, where η ∈ k, l, t ∈ {0, 1, · · · , m − 1}.

n2(q)

Remark that the compatibilities (11) - (16) are fulﬁlled. Now, in this case the compatibil-
ity condition (17) comes down to v(g)⊲′ u(b) = u(g ⊲b) which evaluated at (g, b) = (x, X)
gives ηβx ⊲′ X = u(1 − H). Therefore 1 = H and we have reached a contradiction. (cid:3)

Remark 2.4. If m = n = 2 and q = q = −1 then the two Taft algebras we considered
coincide with the Sweedler’s Hopf algebra.
In this case, Theorem 2.3 provides three
isomorphism classes for the Hopf algebras which factorize through two Sweedler’s Hopf

algebras, namely T1
comparing Corollary 2.2 and [5, Theorem 2.4] we obtain the following:

2, 2(−1, −1) and respectively Q1

2, 2(−1, −1), T−1

2(−1). After carefully

T1

2, 2(−1, −1) = H4 ⊗ H4, T−1

2, 2(−1, −1) = H16,0, Q1

2(−1) = H16,1.

In fact, Theorem 2.3 allows us to compute the number of types of Hopf algebras which
factorize through two Taft algebras.
Corollary 2.5. Let m, n ∈ N∗ \ {1}, d = (m, n) and consider ♯n, m
q, q
types of Hopf algebras which factorize through T

n2(q) and Tm2(q). Then, we have:

to be the number of

♯n, m

|ν(d)| + 1 if m = n > 3, q = qn−1

n, m(q, q) and respectively T σ′

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that m 6= n or m = n > 3 and q /∈ {q, qn−1}. Then according
to Theorem 2.3 two Hopf algebras T σ
n, m(q, q), where σ,
σ′ ∈ Ud(k), are isomorphic if and only if σ = σ′ and the conclusion follows. Now
if m = n > 3 and q = q then T σ
n, n(q, q), where σ, σ′ ∈
Ud(k), are isomorphic if and only if σ = σ′ or σσ′ = 1. This leads to a discussion
on whether ν(d) is odd or even and the two formulas in our statement can be easily
derived. Finally, let m = n > 3 and q = qn−1. In this case, the Hopf algebras which
n, n(qn−1, q), for some
factorize through T
n, n(qn−1, q) are isomorphic if and
σ′ ∈ Ud(k). Since two Hopf algebras in the family T σ
only if the corresponding scalars σ are equal, the proof is ﬁnished.
(cid:3)

n, n(q, q) and respectively T σ′

n2(qn−1) and Tn2(q) are Q1

n(q) together with T σ

Also as a consequence of Theorem 2.3 we can now compute the automorphism groups of
the Hopf algebras described in Corollary 2.2.

Theorem 2.6. Let m, n ∈ N∗ \ {1}, such that m 6= n and d = (m, n). Then, for any
q ∈ Pm(k), q ∈ Pn(k) and σ ∈ Ud(k) we have the following isomorphisms of groups:

phism holds if q 6= q;

1) AutHopf(cid:0)T σ
2) AutHopf(cid:0)T σ

n, m(q, q)(cid:1)∼= k∗ × k∗ ∼= AutHopf(cid:0)T σ

, where k∗ ⋊κ Z2 is the semi-direct

product associated to the action as automorphisms κ : Z2 → Aut(k∗) given by
κ(1)(a) = a−1, for all a ∈ k∗.

Proof. The ﬁrst two assertions are just easy consequences of Theorem 2.3.
Indeed,
consider ﬁrst the bicrossed products T σ
n, n(q, q) with q 6= q.
Then, from the proof of the aforementioned theorem we obtain that any automorphism

n, m(q, q) and respectively T σ

CLASSIFYING BICROSSED PRODUCTS OF TWO TAFT ALGEBRAS

15

of the above Hopf algebras is of the form ψ(a ⊲⊳ g) = u(a) ⊲⊳ v(g) for all a ∈ T
g ∈ Tm2(q), where the maps u and v are given as follows:

n2(q),

u(X j H i) = βj X j H i, v(xlht) = ηl xl ht, with β, η ∈ k∗
and i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}, l, t ∈ {0, 1, · · · , m − 1}.

More precisely, the automorphism ψβ, η corresponding to a pair (β, η) ∈ k∗ × k∗ is given
by:

ψβ, η(X) = β X, ψβ, η(H) = H, ψβ, η(x) = η x, ψβ, η(h) = h.

It is now straightforward to see that the automorphism group of these Hopf algebras is
just k∗ × k∗ with componentwise multiplication.
2) Consider now the Hopf algebra T σ
obtain that the automorphisms of T σ

n, n(q, q). Using again the proof of Theorem 2.3 we
n, n(q, q) are of the form ψβ, η described above with

(β, η) ∈ (k∗ × k∗) and thus AutHopf(cid:0)T σ

n, n(q, q)(cid:1)∼= k∗ × k∗.

However, if q2 = 1, we have in addition the following family of automorphisms denoted
by ϕζ, γ, with (ζ, γ) ∈ (k∗ × k∗), and deﬁned as follows:

ϕζ, γ(X) = ζ x, ϕζ, γ(H) = h, ϕζ, γ(x) = γ X, ϕζ, γ(h) = H.

Moreover, it can be easily seen that the multiplication rules for the two families of
automorphisms are as follows:

ψβ, η ◦ ψβ ′, η′ = ψββ ′, ηη′ , ϕζ, γ ◦ ϕζ ′, γ ′ = ψζ ′γ, ζγ ′
ϕζ, γ ◦ ψβ, η = ϕβζ, ηγ, ψβ, η ◦ ϕζ, γ = ϕζη, γβ.

It is now straightforward to check that the map deﬁned below is a group isomorphism:

n2(qn−1) → T

As before, our approach relies on Theorem 1.2: any Hopf algebra map Γ : Q1
n(q) →
Q1
n(q) is parameterized by a quadruple (u, p, r, v) consisting of unital coalgebra maps
n2(qn−1), v :
u : T
Tn2(q) → Tn2(q) satisfying the compatibility conditions (11)-(18). Exactly as in the
proof of Theorem 2.3 we obtain, based on the compatibility condition (11) applied for
a = X, the same nine possibilities for the pair of maps (u, p). Moreover, again as in the
proof of the aforementioned theorem, the compatibility conditions (13) and (14) give:

n2(qn−1) → Tn2(q), r : Tn2(q) → T

n2(qn−1), p : T

u(X)H a + p(X) ⊲ H a = qn−1H a(cid:0)hb ⊲ u(X)(cid:1)
(cid:0)p(X) ⊳ H a(cid:1)hb = qn−1(cid:0)hb ⊳ u(X)(cid:1)hb + qn−1hbp(X)

where this time ⊲ and respectively ⊳ are those given in (26) and (27).

Suppose the maps u, p are given as in I., i.e.:

u(H) = H, u(X) = α(1 − H), p(H) = h, p(X) = α(1 − h), α ∈ k

Then the compatibility condition (28) gives:

α(1 − H)H + α(1 − h) ⊲ H = qH(cid:0)h ⊲ α(1 − H)(cid:1)

which comes down to α = αqn−1 and since qn−1 6= 1 we get α = 0. As we have seen
before, this implies Γ(X ⊲⊳ 1) = 0 so in this case Γ is not an isomorphism. Using the
same strategy as above, a rather long but straightforward computation based on the
compatibility conditions (28) and (29) rules out the other cases as well except for the
second one and the forth one if n = 2. Indeed, suppose the maps u, p are given as in II.,
i.e.:

u(H) = H, u(X) = α(1 − H) + βX, p(H) = 1, p(X) = 0, α, β ∈ k.

Then the compatibility condition (29) is trivially fulﬁlled while (28) gives:

(cid:0)α(1 − H) + βX(cid:1)H = qn−1H(cid:0)α(1 − H) + βX(cid:1)

which comes down to α = αqn−1 and since qn−1 6= 1 we get α = 0. Thus u(X) = βX
and p(H) = 1. Moreover, (13) and (14) yield the following general formulas for u and p:

u(X j H i) = βj X j H i, where β ∈ k∗, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}
p(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, for all Y ∈ T

n2(qn−1).

Finally, suppose the maps u, p are given as in IV., i.e.:

u(H) = 1, u(X) = 0, p(H) = h, p(X) = α(1 − h) + βx, α, β ∈ k.

Then, (28) is trivially fulﬁlled while (29) gives:

(cid:0)α(1 − h) + βx(cid:1)h = qn−1h(cid:0)α(1 − h) + βx(cid:1)

which comes down to α = αqn−1 and qβ = qn−1β. Therefore, we must have α = 0 and
if n > 3 we also have β = 0 which we know it implies that Γ is not an isomorphism.
However, for n = 2 the second equality is trivially fulﬁlled and we obtain p(X) = βx for
some β ∈ k∗. Then, using again (13) and (14) we get:

p(X iH j) = βixihj, where β ∈ k∗, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1},
u(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, for all Y ∈ T

n2(qn−1)

We employ the same strategy in order to determine the pair of maps (r, v) but relying
this time on the compatibility conditions (12), (15) and respectively (16). Then for any
n > 3 we obtain the following pair of maps:

v(xjhi) = ηj xj hi, where η ∈ k∗, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}
r(y) = ǫ(y)1, for all y ∈ Tn2(q).

and in the case when n = 2 we have, in addition, the following:

v(y) = ǫ(y)1, for all y ∈ Tn2(q).
r(xjhi) = ηj X j H i, where η ∈ k∗, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}

Since, as mentioned before, Q1
2(−1) coincides with the Hopf algebra H16,1 whose auto-
morphism group was described in detail in [5] we will not provide the complete compu-
tations for the case n = 2. We only included the details above in order to emphasize the
diﬀerence between the two cases, namely n = 2 and respectively n > 3, and to explain

CLASSIFYING BICROSSED PRODUCTS OF TWO TAFT ALGEBRAS

why the two automorphism groups are diﬀerent. For the remaining of the proof we will
focus on the case n > 3. Considering the above discussion, we are left to check the
compatibility conditions (17) and (18) for the quadruple (u, p, r, v) given as follows:

u(X jH i) = βj X j H i, v(xjhi) = ηj xj hi, where β, η ∈ k∗, i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}
p(Y ) = ǫ(Y )1, r(y) = ǫ(y)1, for all Y ∈ T

n2(qn−1), y ∈ Tn2(q).

As r and p are trivial maps, the two aforementioned compatibilities reduce to the fol-
lowing:

v(g) ⊲ u(b) = u(g ⊲ b), v(g) ⊳ u(b) = v(g ⊳ b).

Now it is straightforward to see that both compatibilities are trivially fulﬁlled for (g, b) ∈
{(h, H), (x, H), (h, X)}. Finally, if (g, b) = (x, X) we obtain ηβ(1 − H) = 1 − H and
respectively ηβ(1 − h) = 1 − h and thus η = β−1. Moreover, the automorphism induced
by the quadruple (u, p, r, v) depicted above, which we will denote by ϕβ for any β ∈ k∗,
is given as follows:

ϕβ(H) = H, ϕβ(X) = β X, ϕβ(h) = h, ϕβ(x) = β−1 x.

We can now conclude that AutHopf(cid:0)Q1

sends any automorphism ϕβ to β ∈ k∗. Together with [5, Corollary 2.5] we obtain the
desired conclusion.
