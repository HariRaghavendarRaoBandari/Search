ABSTRACT
The near-maximum spectra of most superluminous supernovae that are not dominated by in-
teraction with a H-rich CSM (SLSN-I) are characterised by a blue spectral peak and a series of
absorption lines which have been identiﬁed as O II. SN 2011kl, associated with the ultra-long
gamma-ray burst GRB111209A, also had a blue peak but a featureless optical/UV spectrum.
Radiation transport methods are used to show that the spectra (not including SN 2007bi, which
has a redder spectrum at peak, like ordinary SNe Ic) can be explained by a rather steep den-
sity distribution of the ejecta, whose composition appears to be typical of carbon-oxygen
cores of massive stars which can have low metal content. If the photospheric velocity is
∼ 10000 − 15000 km s−1 several lines form in the UV. O II lines, however, arise from very
highly excited lower levels, which require signiﬁcant departures from Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium to be populated. These SLSNe are not thought to be powered primarily by 56Ni
decay. An appealing scenario is that they are energised by X-rays from the shock driven by
a magnetar wind into the SN ejecta. The apparent lack of evolution of line velocity with
time that characterises SLSNe up to about maximum is another argument in favour of the
magnetar scenario. The smooth UV continuum of SN 2011kl requires higher ejecta velocities
(∼ 20000 km s−1): line blanketing leads to an almost featureless spectrum. Helium is ob-
served in some SLSNe after maximum. The high ionization near maximum implies that both
He and H may be present but not observed at early times. The spectroscopic classiﬁcation of
SLSNe should probably reﬂect that of SNe Ib/c. Extensive time coverage is required for an
accurate classiﬁcation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Supernovae (SNe) are physically divided into two groups, core-
collapse and thermonuclear. Classically, they are typed based on
their light curves and spectra (see Filippenko 1997, for a review).
Recently, however, new classes of SNe have emerged that only par-
tially ﬁt into this classical scheme. In particular, a number of very
luminous events have been detected by different surveys, many
at redshifts exceeding 0.5 (e.g., Quimby et al. 2007; Barbary et al.
2009; Quimby et al. 2011; Chomiuk et al. 2011; Leloudas et al.
2012; Lunnan 2013; Howell et al. 2013; Papadopoulos et al. 2015,
see Gal-Yam (2012) for a review). Although they are collectively

classiﬁed as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), their observa-
tional properties are quite diverse.

Some SLSNe clearly bear the sign of interaction with a
hydrogen-rich circum-stellar medium (CSM; Smith et al. 2007;
Ofek et al. 2007; Drake et al. 2011; Benetti et al. 2014). This masks
the actual SN ejecta, making their nature unclear, although a link
with massive stars is likely (e.g., Smith et al. 2007; Agnoletto et al.
2009). SLSNe without the signatures of interaction with a H-
rich CSM, (“H-poor SLSNe”) are in turn divided into two rather
vaguely deﬁned groups. Most of them have very blue spectra at
maximum which show strong O II lines (SLSN-I, Gal-Yam et al.
2009). Some, such as SN2007bi (Gal-Yam et al. 2009), have red-
der maxium-light spectra, closer to those of type Ic SNe (SNe Ic),
and are pair-instability SN (PISN) candidates. Both of these lat-
ter groups would technically be classiﬁed as SNe Ic, or at least as

stripped-envelope events, since hydrogen lines are never strong. Fi-
nally, the ULGRB 111209A/SN 2011kl is intermediate in luminos-
ity between GRB/SNe and SLSNe, but its spectral energy distribu-
tion resembles that of SLSNe.

Various interpretations have been proposed for these SNe.
The PISN candidate SN 2007bi (Gal-Yam et al. 2009) has very ex-
tended optical light curves, and emits strong forbidden lines of
[Fe II] at late times. This is consistent with a 56Ni-driven light
curve, and suggestive of the explosion of a very massive star with a
zero-age main sequence mass close to, or in excess of 100 M⊙. This
scenario has been criticized (e.g., Nicholl et al. 2013), but in our
opinion the presence of forbidden emission lines of Fe in an amount
compatible with the 56Ni that is necessary to drive the light curve
(Gal-Yam et al. 2009) makes the Ni-driven scenario uncontrover-
sial. The massive collapse scenario (Moriya et al. 2010) agrees on
this despite uncertainties. For none of the other H-poor SLSNe has
the presence or amount of 56Ni been conﬁrmed. These SNe typ-
ically show strong absorption lines of lighter elements, including
oxygen, and have never been observed in the nebular phase as they
are typically too distant to be observed at late times. Their light
curves do not appear to be consistent with being powered by 56Ni
decay (Inserra et al. 2013; Howell et al. 2013; Papadopoulos et al.
2015). One alternative to 56Ni is that the SN is powered by en-
ergy emitted by a magnetized, rapidly spinning neutron star (a
Magnetar), (e.g., Bucciantini et al. 2009). In a magnetar-powered
scenario interaction of a magnetar-driven shock with the SN
ejecta could transform kinetic energy into radiative energy and
power the SN light curve, leading to SLSNe (Kasen & Bildsten
2010; Woosley 2010). Another possibility is interaction with H-
and He-free CSM (Sorokina et al. 2015; Moriya & Maeda 2012;
Chatzopoulos & Wheeler 2012; Baklanov et al. 2015). These stud-
ies have focussed on reproducing the light curves of SLSNe. How-
ever, spectra should also be explained. One signature of interaction
with an H- and He-free CSM would be shallow absorption lines,
and a spectrum that looks too cool for its luminosity, which is the
sum of two components, the SN and the interaction. An example is
the "Super-Chandrasekhar" SN Ia 2009dc (Hachinger et al. 2012).
This is not what we see in SLSNe. We see the opposite: a spectrum
which is too hot for its luminosity. The presence of an outer CSM
does not seem to be compatible with the spectra of this class of
SLSNe, which we therefore call “non-interacting”.

Useful information about SN ejecta can be obtained from
modelling their spectra. As the SN ejecta expand, deeper and
deeper layers of the exploded star are exposed, and spectra reveal
their properties. A consistent calculation can be used to determine
the abundances in the ejecta, and these in turn may indicate the
properties of the progenitor and the effect of the explosion. This has
been demonstrated for type Ia SNe (e.g., Mazzali et al. 2008), as
well as for SNe Ib/c (e.g., Sauer et al. 2006). However, for SLSNe
the only attempts to model the spectra have relied on parametrised
codes, which are effective in suggesting line identiﬁcations but can-
not provide quantitative information with respect to masses, ener-
gies and abundances (e.g., Vreeswijk et al. 2014). Here we apply
our models to SLSNe. Our methodology is outlined in Section 2.

A variety of SLSN spectra have been presented in various pa-
pers (e.g., Quimby et al. 2011; Chomiuk et al. 2011; Inserra et al.
2013; Vreeswijk et al. 2014; Nicholl et al. 2014). Only in a few
cases are time-series of spectra available. We have selected
iPTF13ajg (Section 3) and PTF09cnd (Section 4) as typical ex-
amples of line-rich SLSNe. We also examine SNLS-06D4eu
(Howell et al. 2013), the most distant spectroscopically conﬁrmed
published SLSN to date (Section 5). We then compare the results

with a line-poor, luminous SN 2011kl/GRB111209A (Greiner et al.
2015) in Section 6. We conclude with a discussion of the general
properties of SLSN spectra, and the inferences that can be made
about these events from their spectral properties (Section 7).

2 METHOD

The spectra of SNe (and SNe Ic in particular) can have lines of
different widths. SNe Ic are a particularly interesting case, as the
range goes from narrow (a few 1000 km s−1, as for SN 1994I,
Sauer et al. 2006) to very broad lines (∼ 60000 km s−1, as for SN
2002ap, Mazzali et al. 2002). This is roughly reﬂected in the clas-
siﬁcation of SNe Ic versus broad-lined (BL) SNe Ic. Modelling is
necessary to turn the intrinsic properties of the gas in the SN ejecta
(density and abundance distributions, excitation and ionization de-
gree and their radial dependence) into observed line widths, taking
into account the effect of line blending, which is particularly impor-
tant in the rapidly expanding SN ejecta where the material follows
a Hubble-type law.

The spectra of SLSNe are characterised by lines of mostly
singly ionized elements, but are unique among SNe in showing O II
lines. Line identiﬁcation, while probably correct especially when
multiple features are identiﬁed, is often performed using codes
that do not treat the level occupation numbers and the radiation
ﬁeld consistently. We therefore need to verify these results. Inter-
estingly, line velocity in SLSNe does not seem to evolve much
with time (see, e.g., Chomiuk et al. 2011; Nicholl et al. 2014;
Vreeswijk et al. 2014). This is different from the typical behaviour
of SN spectra. The question is what model can reproduce this.

We modelled the SLSN spectra using our Monte Carlo su-
pernova spectrum synthesis code. This has been described in sev-
eral papers (Mazzali & Lucy 1993; Mazzali 2000) and has been
used to model SNe of different spectral types (Mazzali et al. 2013,
2014b). The code assumes that the SN luminosity is emitted at a
lower boundary as a black body and transported through an ex-
panding SN ‘atmosphere’ of variable density and composition. The
atmosphere is assumed to be in radiative equilibrium, and radi-
ation can be absorbed in lines or scattered off electrons. Level
populations are computed using a modiﬁed nebular approxima-
tion, which is appropriate for the conditions prevailing in SN ejecta
(Pauldrach et al. 1996). The emergent spectrum is computed both
by counting emerging energy packets (which are used as proxies for
photons), and by solving the formal integral of the transfer equa-
tion using as source functions and opacities obtained in the Monte
Carlo experiment by iterating with the radiation ﬁeld (Lucy 1999).
Because our code solves for the level populations and the radiation
ﬁeld consistently, it can be used to estimate masses and abundances
in the outer part of the SN ejecta (see, e.g., Mazzali et al. 2014a).
While the code is not fully self-consistent, in that it does
not depend on a speciﬁc explosion model but rather uses one
to describe the layers above a sharp photosphere, it is also not
parametrized, because occupation numbers, and hence line opac-
ities, are computed consistently with the properties of the radia-
tion ﬁeld. It therefore goes beyond simple line identiﬁcation, mak-
ing it possible to quantify relative and absolute elemental abun-
dances simultaneously with the density and mass in the expand-
ing SN ejecta. With the method of abundance tomography (e.g.,
Stehle et al. 2005) it is possible to take advantage of the progres-
sive thinning out of the SN ejecta and explore the properties of
deeper and deeper layers.

The code can treat non-thermal excitation of He consis-

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS ,

tently, computing the effect on the level population of non-thermal
particles as e.g., produced by radioactive decays (Lucy 1991;
Mazzali & Lucy 1998; Hachinger et al. 2012), if the radiation ﬁeld
is known. This is possible for SNe Ib because we know that the non-
thermal radiation ﬁeld comes from the incomplete thermalization
of the gamma-rays and positrons produced by the decay of 56Ni
and 56Co. As an alternative, non-thermal effects can be simulated
in a parametrised way, modifying the population of the excited lev-
els of relevant ions by introducing departure coefﬁcients that should
imitate a consistent calculation (e.g., Mazzali et al. 2009). We use
the latter approach here because we do not know the details of the
non-thermal radiation ﬁeld and do not treat non-thermal effects in
O II explicitly. However, since the O II ion is characterised by ex-
cited levels with a very high excitation energy, it can be expected
to be sensitive to non-thermal radiation in a way similar to He I.
We therefore apply departure coefﬁcients similar to those obtained
for He I (Lucy 1991; Mazzali & Lucy 1998; Hachinger et al. 2012),
mimicking non-thermal effects on O II.

3 LINE-RICH SLSNE: IPTF13AJG

We begin with the spectra of one of the best observed SLSNe,
iPTF13ajg, at redshift z = 0.74. This supernova was discovered by
the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). A large dataset
for this event was presented in Vreeswijk et al. (2014), making this
an excellent ‘template’ SLSN, since its behaviour is similar to that
of many other less well observed cases. The spectra are charac-
terised by a slow evolution. The strongest lines have been iden-
tiﬁed as Fe III, C II, C III, Si III, O II (Vreeswijk et al. 2014). The
lines are broad, but not extremely broad. A characteristic line width
seems to be ∼ 15000 km s−1. Line blending is not as dominant as
in GRB/SNe, for example (see, e.g., Iwamoto et al. 1998), or even
in non-GRB BL-Ic SNe (e.g., Mazzali et al. 2013). However, line
width is not easy to relate to a velocity spread, as most lines are
actually blends. Modelling is necessary to address this.

The lines that have been identiﬁed are not indicative of a
particularly high temperature, despite the high luminosity. This is
understandable, because SLSNe evolve slowly in luminosity, and
therefore they are observed with much larger radii than SNe Ib/c,
which reduces the temperature. The only indication of a very high
temperature is the presence of O II lines. It has been noted that the
ionization potential of O I is high. While this is true, it is similar to
H I (13.6 eV), and much lower than that of He I (24.6 eV). How-
ever, this is not the whole story. The observed lines, if they are cor-
rectly identiﬁed as O II, arise from very highly-excited lower levels,
which have excitation potentials of ∼ 25 eV. This is higher than the
energy required to excite He I lines in SNe Ib (∼ 20 eV), and in-
deed comparable to the ionization potential of He I. It is therefore
to be expected that the excitation of O II levels is not in thermal
equilibrium with the local radiation ﬁeld. We can test this with our
models, and attempt to derive relative abundances in the SN ejecta.
This should in turn shed light on the nature of the progenitor and
on the mechanism that powers SLSNe.

Line velocity evolves very slowly with time in iPTF13ajg, as
in other SLSNe. In order for the position of the lines not to move
signiﬁcantly over several weeks or months despite quite a high ex-
pansion velocity, either a steady-state situation holds (as in stellar
winds), or the density proﬁle must be very steep. In the former case,
we would expect very broad lines, since ρ ∝ r−2, which leads to
signiﬁcant mass being able to absorb radiation over a large range of
velocities. Furthermore, the spectra of SLSNe (iPTF13ajg is very

well-observed but others show a similar behaviour) are seen to be-
come redder with time as the luminosity evolves. This is typical of
SNe and would not be expected in a steady-state regime. We there-
fore explore the latter option.

In order to reproduce the spectra of iPTF13ajg we used a steep
density proﬁle, ρ ∝ r−7, which is typical of low-energy explosions
of compact stars (e.g., Sauer et al. 2006). Line width depends on
the gradient of the density (see, e.g., Mazzali et al. 2000). Other
characteristic features of SLSNe are that they are extremely lumi-
nous, but also rather long-lived. In the case of iPTF13ajg the mod-
els we tested have ejecta mass ranging from ∼ 25 to ∼ 50 M⊙.
The mass is always quite large mass, which is required by the
long risetime, the high luminosity and the relatively large velocity
(Vreeswijk et al. 2014).

3.1 Pre-Maximum epochs

The spectra of PTF13ajg and similar SLSNe before and around
maximum light are characterized by strong absorption lines, both in
the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and in the optical region. The spec-
tra typically turn over at ∼ 2700 Å. This is extremely blue for any
SN: normally SN spectra are subject to strong metal absorption (Fe,
Co, Ni, Ti, Cr) shortwards of ∼ 4000 Å. The behaviour of SLSNe
may indicate a higher temperature than in other SNe Ib/c, but this is
in conﬂict with the ionization degree, which is not extremely high,
and with the fact that more highly ionized metal ions are even more
likely to absorb in the UV. It seems more likely that it is the result
of a low metal abundance.

We focus ﬁrst on one of the best observed spectra of
iPTF13ajg, obtained on 2013 April 9, about 8 days before max-
imum (Vreeswijk et al. 2014). We adopted a distance modulus
µ = 43.25 mag and no reddening. We used a rest-frame epoch of
50 days for this spectrum, starting from the bolometric light curve
shown in Vreeswijk et al. (2014, ﬁgure 5), but we also tested a
shorter risetime (40 days). This range of risetimes does not change
the nature of our results but does affect the estimate of the mass,
as the density proﬁle can be rescaled down in mass, without al-
tering the ratio between kinetic energy and ejected mass. Fig. 1
shows the spectrum along with two models. One model was com-
puted without considering non-thermal ionization/excitation, the
other includes it in a parametrized way. The models are character-
ized by the same luminosity (7 × 1010 L⊙), photospheric velocity
(12250 km s−1), and abundances. The photospheric velocity does
not evolve much during this phase, and the mass that is responsible
for line formation is only ∼ 3 M⊙. The composition is dominated
by carbon (40 per cent by mass), oxygen (48 per cent), helium (10
per cent), neon (2 per cent). Heavier elements have low abundances
(see Table 1). The abundances were adjusted to optimise the match
to the observed spectrum, and they indicate substantially sub-solar
values (∼ 1/4 solar), based on the iron content.

The thermal model matches the observations reasonably well,
but performs best bluewards of 3000 Å. The main contributions to
the various lines are marked in Fig. 1, and a list of the strongest
lines is presented in Table 2. They are generally in agreement with
previous results (e.g., Vreeswijk et al. 2014), but with some dif-
ferences. In particular, Ti III leaves an important imprint on the
spectrum, and it is solely responsible for the line near 2900 Å. In
the case of SN 2011kl this is the only isolated line that is seen
(Greiner et al. 2015, see Section 6). In the red part of the spectrum
only weak C II lines are produced by this model, which may match
some possible observed features but not the strongest lines. These
have typically been identiﬁed as O II lines.

Figure 1. The spectrum of iPTF13ajg on 9 April 2013, compared to two
synthetic spectra: one does not include an increase in the occupation num-
bers of O II and He I to account for non-thermal effects (cyan line), the other
does (red line).

Figure 2. As Fig. 1, but showing the model prediction in the entire rest-
frame optical domain.

As mentioned above, all O II lines come from highly excited
lower levels. O I itself has an ionization potential of 13.6 eV, like
H I and similar to Fe II and Si II. However, all of its NUV-optical
lines arise from levels with excitation potential ranging from 23 to
32 eV. Thus, while it is reasonable to expect that O II and Fe III are
present, O II lines should not be very strong unless the temperature,
and hence the ionization, is even higher. The strength of the O II
lines cannot be increased by just increasing the oxygen abundance,
as this is already very high.

However, it is possible that the O II levels are excited by non-
thermal processes, just like He I lines in SNe Ib (which actually
come from lower levels with smaller excitation potentials). We
mimicked this by increasing the population of the excited states
of O II (and He I) by values comparable to values for SNe Ib (Lucy
1991; Hachinger et al. 2012) and SNe IIb (Mazzali et al. 2009). We
applied a single value for each epoch, but the departure coefﬁcient
increases with time, from values of ∼ 100 early on up to ∼ 104 at
the later epochs. This reﬂects the progressive increase of the pen-

etration of non-thermalised particles through the outer ejecta. This
is sufﬁcient to produce O II lines that match the observations quite
well at rest-frame wavelenghts between 3000 and 6000 Å.

C II lines are quite strong. A C II line (λ4267) is important in
shaping the absorption of O II near 4100 Å and making it broad. An
interesting prediction of this model is that C II 6578 and 7256 Å
should be strong (see Fig. 2). This region falls outside the ob-
served optical range for iPTF13ajg. The NIR spectra reported by
Vreeswijk et al. (2014) are very noisy.

The time series of pre-maximum spectra is characterized by
an essentially constant photospheric velocity (12250 km s−1). The
luminosity increase leading to maximum light results in a tempera-
ture that decreases only slowly as the ejecta expand, which ensures
that the spectra show very little sign of change in this period, which
covers about one month. This is quite unusual for a SN.

Because of the parametrized treatment of non-thermal pro-
cesses (we do not know the properties of the non-thermal radiation
ﬁeld, which is unlikely to be the result of partial thermalization of
gamma-rays and positrons), we cannot establish the masses of the

pears to be dominated by helium, carbon and oxygen, the elements
that are expected to dominate in the core of a massive star, while
heavier elements have sub-solar abundances.

Our density proﬁle has a mass of ∼ 3 M⊙ above the photo-
sphere. Although this produces reasonable conditions in the ther-
mal part of the spectrum, this value should only be taken as in-
dicative. The corresponding kinetic energy of expansion is ∼ 3 ×
1052 erg. This is quite large, and is dictated by the need to have a
steep gradient in density at velocities of 10-15,000 km s−1 in order
to guarantee that the photosphere recedes only slowly with time (in
practice it corresponds to 3 M⊙ of material moving at 12000 km
s−1). A large mass is also required by the long duration of the light
curve. If a shorter risetime is used, a smaller mass and energy are
obtained.

Fig. 3 shows the series of spectra before and near maximum
with their corresponding models, both without and with enhanced
excitation, to mimick non-thermal effects. The main parameters of
all the models are summarised in Table 1.

3.2 Post-Maximum epochs

After maximum light, the spectra of iPTF13ajg begin to evolve. The
ﬂux peak progressively shifts to the red, which resembles SNe Ib/c.
The O II lines are no longer very strong, and lines of lower ion-
ization species become visible. No rest-frame UV information is
available, which limits our ability to constrain the metal content in
the regions where the spectra form (see, e.g., Mazzali et al. 2014b).
Observed and synthetic spectra are compared in Fig. 4.

The decreasing luminosity is now accompanied by a decreas-
ing photospheric velocity, so that the mass above the photosphere
becomes quite large at progressively later epochs. We do not re-
quire any signiﬁcant change in the abundances, although the ﬁts are
not as good as at pre-maximum epochs (see Fig. 4), and thus we are
less conﬁdent about these results. He I lines now become visible,
and a parametrised increase of the level populations to take non-
thermal heating into account is sufﬁcient to reproduce them. This
was also used before maximum, but because most He was ionized
(He II) He I lines were never strong. Based on its post-maximum
spectra, iPTF13ajg should be classiﬁed as a SN Ib. It is normal for
He I lines to appear late in SNe Ib, as the result of the delayed onset
of non-thermal effects on He I in a cool gas caused by the opacity
encountered by non-thermalized decay products as they travel in
the SN ejecta (Lucy 1991). In the case of iPTF13ajg, however, the
late appearance of the He I lines is also due to the late cooling and
recombination of He II. On the other hand, the ionization of oxygen
is now too low for O II lines ever to become visible.

The synthetic spectra do not match the observed spectra as
well as they do at epochs before maximum light. This may partly
be the consequence of our ignorance of the ﬂux level in the UV.
A strong absorption near 3000 Å is not reproduced. This feature is
not often seen in SLSNe, but it seems to be present in LSQS12dlf
(Nicholl et al. 2014).

The trend for a cooler spectrum and decreasing velocities con-
tinues after maximum. Lines of singly ionized species become
more and more dominant as the temperature decreases. Flux block-
ing in the (unobserved) UV is almost entirely due to iron-group
species. At the latest epochs, strong Ca II IR triplet, C I 9062, 9094,
and O I 7774 are predicted in the redder part of the visible range,
which is also not observed. This is in line with the spectra of other
SLSNe (see Nicholl et al. 2014).

As the photospheric velocity decreases with time, we are now
exploring deeper regions of the ejecta. Because of the steep density
distribution that we adopted, the enclosed mass increases rapidly
with depth. In the ﬁnal model ∼ 20 M⊙ of material contribute to
the spectrum. This is necessary because at an epoch of ∼ 140 days
the spectra still show signiﬁcant absorption.

4 LINE-RICH SLSNE: PTF09CND

The SLSN PTF09cnd (Quimby et al. 2011), discovered by the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), has coverage of both the pre-and
post-maximum epochs. We use the original classiﬁcation spectrum

taken at the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) with the In-
termediate dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System (ISIS), as
well as two later spectra taken at the 10-m Keck-I telescope with the
Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) (see Quimby et al.
2011, for details on the spectra). Because of the relatively low red-
shift (z = 0.258), data only cover the UV redwards of 2500 Å.
PTF09cnd was signiﬁcantly less luminous than iPTF13ajg, and
reached maximum more rapidly, but its spectra resemble those
of iPTF13ajg, showing the O II line series in the optical prior to
maximum and a few strong metal lines in the only partially ob-
served near-UV. The combination of lower luminosities and smaller
epochs leads to a similar spectra evolution. In the ﬁnal spectrum
He I lines are strong, so that PTF09cnd would also be classiﬁed as
a SN Ib.

We modelled PTF09cnd with the same background structure
as iPTF13ajg, including non-thermal excitation. A distance modu-
lus µ = 40.55 mag was used. The two August spectra are both be-
fore maximum, which occurred towards the end of August. Despite
the lower luminosity, our ﬁts indicate that the spectra are shaped
by the same lines which were identiﬁed in iPTF13ajg, although the
UV is only partially explored. The spectra can be reproduced using
a smaller mass (7 – 15 M⊙), such that the pre-maximum spectra are
shaped by only ∼ 0.5 M⊙ of ejecta. As we mentioned above, the
total mass cannot be determined with great accuracy in the absence
of nebular spectra. The mass above the photosphere is subject to
uncertainties in our estimated date of explosion and non-thermal
departure coefﬁcients. The kinetic energy is 7 – 15 1051 erg. The

main results are reported in Table 3. Synthetic spectra are com-
pared to the observed ones in Fig. 5. In the ﬁgure, spectra are shown
with their real ﬂux level. Because of the very rapid rise to maxi-
mum, the temperature in the earlier spectra is actually higher than
in iPTF13ajg. The spectra before maximum show very little evolu-
tion. The line velocity also remains practically constant. Only much
later, in the post-maximum phase, do spectra turn red. At this point
non-thermally excited O II lines are no longer visible.

Because of the limited UV coverage the determination of the
metal content is less reliable, but results seem to indicate a low
metallicity, as in iPTF13ajg or lower. One signiﬁcant difference is
the weakness of the C II lines: the lines between 3000 and 4000 Å
are weak, while those between 6000 and 7000 Å are absent. Al-
though this is partly due to the higher temperature, which almost
completely suppresses C II, we still need to use a signiﬁcantly
lower abundance than in iPTF13ajg. This is also useful to keep
several UV lines, and in particular the one near 2200 Å, which is
dominated by C III 2297 Å, from becoming too strong, creating too
much ﬂuorescent ﬂux to the red. We also need a much lower Fe
abundance than in iPTF13ajg, again in order to prevent very strong
UV lines. None of these lines are covered by the spectra, so these
estimates are highly uncertain.

5 LINE-RICH SLSNE: SNLS-06D4EU

The ﬁnal line-rich SLSN that we consider is SNLS-06D4eu, the
furthest spectoscopically conﬁrmed SLSN at the time of writing.
The event was discovered by the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS;
Perrett et al. 2010) at a redshift z = 1.588 (Howell et al. 2013),
conﬁrmed using the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very
Large Telescope (VLT) with the FORS1 instrument. It has a sim-
ilar luminosity as iPTF13ajg. Because of the high redshift, the
ground-based spectrum only samples the rest-frame UV, reaching
very short wavelengths. Since the SN was optically faint and it was
not spectrally identiﬁed at the time of observation, only one spec-
trum is available, at an epoch close to maximum. This is shown in
Fig. 6 together with a synthetic spectrum computed using a distance
modulus µ = 45.34 mag.

The model that was used to compute the synthetic spectrum
was again the same as in the previous cases. The SN rose to
peak relatively rapidly, so that the epoch of spectrum is estimated
to be only about 14 rest-frame days after explosion. This indi-
cates a relatively low mass, and so we used the same mass as for
PTF09cnd (∼ 15 M⊙). The rapid rise and the high luminosity re-
quire a high velocity in order for the temperature and the ioniza-
tion to reach the observed values. SNLS-06D4eu has the highest
velocity of any of the line-rich SLSNe analysed here. Only the
GRB/SN 2011kl reaches higher velocities (see next section). We
used v ∼ 16500 km s−1, yielding a temperature near the photo-
sphere of ∼ 18000 K, the highest temperature of any of the spectra
modelled in this paper. The mass above the photosphere is only
slightly less than in the case of PTF09cnd. The high temperature
causes the spectrum to have an even bluer turnover (near 2000 Å)

than previous cases (∼ 2800 Å). Only ∼ 0.25 M⊙ of material con-
tribute to the spectrum. Model parameters are given in Table 4.

Beyond 2000 Å the spectrum is similar to those of other
SLSNe, showing lines of C III, Fe III, Si III, Mg II. The line near
2200 Å can be reproduced as C III 2297 Å, but a very low carbon
abundance is required to reproduce the line strength, even lower
than in the case of PTF09cnd. C II lines are very weak in both
PTF09cnd and SNLS-06D4eu, because the average ionization is
much higher than what would favour the formation of these lines.
This is a consequence of the high temperature. The lack of C II lines
may indeed be a common feature of SLSNe at very early epochs.
At the same time, a high iron abundance is needed to reproduce the
feature near 1800 Å as Fe III. This is in contrast with our model for
PTF09cnd. If this is correct, this suggests that the ejecta of SNLS-
06D4eu were nuclearly processed, so that it is not possible to deter-
mine a metallicity. Silicon also has a high abundance, as indicated
by the strength of the line near 2400 Å, which is reproduced as Si III
2542 Å, although the dominant ionization stage of silicon is Si IV.

reproduced by the resonance line Al III
1854 Å. This line is normally seen in the spectra of late-O
stars (Walborn, Nichols-Bohlin & Panek 1985) as well as in B-
stars (Rountree & Sonneborn 1993), including interacting binaries
(Mazzali 1987; Mazzali et al. 1992). It has not – to our knowledge
– been individually resolved in type I SN spectra, as line blocking
by Fe lines is usually too strong (Mazzali & Lucy 1990, identiﬁed
this line in the spectrum of SN 1987A). The resonance line Si III

1892 Å also contributes to this line. Many lines of doubly ionized
ions are visible; the singly ionized species are weak due to the high
temperature. It should be noted that Fe III lines do not have the
same predicted ratio in the synthetic spectrum as the observed fea-
tures. In particular, the synthetic absorption near 1700 Å appears
too red because it is affected by Fe III 1895, 1914, 1926 Å, which
is necessary in order to form the line near 1950 Å, which is Fe III
2068, 2079 Å. The Mg II resonance line (2795, 2805 Å) is visible
near 2600 Å but is weak, while Si III 2542 is responsible for the
weak absorption near 2400 Å.

Since the spectra do not cover the rest-frame optical we can-
not determine whether O II lines are as strong as in other SLSNe.
However, the higher ionization degree of this spectrum means that
strong NLTE effects are not required to cause the O II lines to ap-
pear.

6 LINE-POOR SLSNE: GRB/SN 2011KL

While most known SLSNe show similar spectra, recently a SN
has been discovered in association with an ultra-long gamma-ray
burst (ULGRB), GRB111209A at a redshift z = 0.67. The SN
shows many characteristics of SLSNe. SN 2011kl was much more
luminous than classical GRB/SNe, but was not quite as luminous
as SLSNe (Greiner et al. 2015). Its light curve evolved over just a
few weeks, as do GRB/SNe, but its spectrum (available only near
maximum) did not show any of the broad lines that characterize
GRB/SNe (see, e.g.,
Iwamoto et al. 1998) or broad-lined SNe Ic
(see, e.g., Mazzali et al. 2013). The spectrum was blue, turning
over only at ∼ 3000 Å, like SLSNe. Unlike SLSNe, it was rather
featureless, with only one strong and rather broad absorption line,
near 2800 Å.

In Greiner et al. (2015) we adopted a model similar to the one
used here to reproduce the spectrum of SN2011 kl. Here we high-
light some of the features of that model, and contrast them to those
of SLSNe. A distance modulus µ = 43.01 mag was used. Model
parameters are given in Table 5.

In Fig. 7 we compare the spectrum of SN 2011kl with that
of iPTF13ajg. The similarity is clear. If the line seen near 2900Å
is that same as the line which is identiﬁed as Ti III in iPTF13ajg,
then the velocity must be higher in SN 2011kl, as the blueshift is
larger. We adopted for SN 2011kl a similar density distribution as
for iPTF13ajg, but set a photospheric velocity of ∼ 20000 km s−1,
as opposed to ∼ 12000 km s−1.

The spectrum of SN 2011kl appears somewhat cooler, which
is the result of the lower luminosity and the higher expansion ve-
locity. The high photospheric velocity means that line blending is
stronger in SN 2011kl. Line blending is particularly strong in the
UV, where many lines are present which merge causing signiﬁcant
line blanketing. This is seen also in GRB/SNe, which are charac-
terised by a high velocity. The metal content is quite similar in the
two events. The spectrum does not show strong O II lines, suggest-
ing that non-thermal effects are not strong in SN 2011kl.

In order to set the level of the UV ﬂux, the mass above the
photosphere and the abundance of metals can be adjusted. We ﬁnd

that a mass of ∼ 0.3 M⊙ above 19000 km s−1 leads to the best
convergence. Since only one spectrum is available, it is not possi-
ble to determine whether the density proﬁle is the same at lower
velocities. The rapid evolution of the light curve however suggests
a smaller mass (∼ 2.5 M⊙, Greiner et al. 2015), and a higher ra-
tio of kinetic energy to ejected mass. This is similar to the case
of GRB/SNe when compared to normal type Ib/c SNe. Keeping
the composition similar to the model of iPTF13ajg, and modifying
only the ratio of metals versus carbon and oxygen, we ﬁnd that a
metal content of ∼ 1/4 solar is required for SN2011 kl, which is in
line with the metallicity estimated for the host galaxy (Greiner et al.
2015). Additionally, the temperature is lower because of the lower
luminosity. Line blanketing and the lower temperature depress the
UV spectrum shortwards of 3000 Å compared to iPTF13ajg 7. Our
synthetic spectrum is compared to the observed one in Fig. 8.

We tested different metal abundances by modifying the abaun-
dances of all elements heavier than Neon. The results are shown in
7. At lower metal content line blending is reduced and some of the
individual line features begin to appear. Also, the UV ﬂux short-
wards of 3000 Å is too high, so less radiation is reprocessed to the
red and the ﬂux above 3000 Å is too low. Conversely, if the metal
content is too high, the ﬂux shortwards of 3000 Å is suppressed,
and the excessive reprocessing least to a strong peak near 3000 Å.
Interestingly the metallicity used for SN 2011kl is similar to
that in iPTF13ajg. Several papers on SLSNe estimated the star-
formation rate in the host galaxy, while it is less common to
ﬁnd an estimate of the metallicity. In the case of SN 2006oz,
Leloudas et al. (2012) quote a value Z/Z⊙ ∼ 0.17+0.18
−0.08, which

is in line with our estimates in SLSNe. So our models may be used
to estimate the metallicity of the progenitor, as in the case of other
SNe (Mazzali et al. 2014b).

7 DISCUSSION

Our models show that the spectra of SLSNe can be reproduced al-
most self-consistently by making just a few assumptions, which are
necessary to reproduce some of the peculiar features of these spec-
tra. These observed features and their implications are listed below.

• The spectral lines do not evolve in velocity until well after
maximum: this requires a steep density gradient, such that the de-
crease in density with radius is faster than that with time. We
adopted a density structure characterised by ρ ∝ r−7. This is
typical of low-energy 1D explosions of compact progenitors (e.g.,
Sauer et al. 2006), but is not normally seen in high-energy SNe Ib/c,
and it may suggest that SLSNe are overall more spherically sym-
metric than SNe Ib/c with a high EK/Mej (Leloudas et al. 2015).
−1], as shown
SLSNe seem to have a low EK/Mej∼ 1[1051 erg M⊙
in Table 6.

• The line velocities are not particularly high. This can be simu-
lated by adjusting the density. The steep density proﬁle also means
that the lines are not very broad.

• The light curves of many SLSNe are broad. This requires a

large ejected mass, independent of the powering mechanism.

• Spectral lines from very highly-excited states are observed.
Even at the high luminosities of SLSNe, lines such as O II, which
are strong in the optical before maximum, require non-thermal ex-
citation processes. He I lines are affected as well, but only appear

• The metal lines are weak, and the spectra are blue. This re-
quires a fairly low metal abundance. In the case of iPTF13ajg we
ﬁnd a metallicity of ∼ 1/4 solar. This only produces weak iron
lines, and allows the spectrum to turn over at ∼ 3000 Å, compared
to ∼ 4000 Å in other SNe Ib/c. SN 2011kl has a similar metallicity,
but line blanketing depresses the UV ﬂux shortwards of ∼ 3000 Å.
• The composition of the ejecta that contribute to spectrum for-
mation is consistent with the CO cores of massive stars, indicating
a common origin of SNe Ib/c and SLSNe. The latter appear to have
larger masses on average, but it may well be that such events are
rare and only the brightest end has been uncovered so far. The case
of the GRB/SN 2011kl, which was not as luminous as the rest of
the SLSNe but was discovered only thanks to the GRB, indicates
that this may indeed be the case. SNLS-06D4eu may show signs of
nuclearly processed material.

• The fact that the spectrum can be reproduced using the full SN
luminosity including the depth of the lines suggests that these SNe
are not energised by interaction with an external H- and He-poor
CSM.

While these are general results, it is difﬁcult to be precise
about the mass and energy of the explosion. Our models (see Table
6) require large masses, but do not explore the inner layers because
there are no very late-time data. Therefore the mass values given in
Table 6 should be regarded as estimates only. The kinetic energy of
our models range from 0.4 to ∼ 5 × 1052 erg. This range is typical
⊙ ],
of GRB/SNe. The ratio EK/Mej is not far from 1 [1051erg M−1
ensuring that lines are not too broad, except for GRB/SN 2011kl,
which reaches EK/Mej ≈ 2 and has blended lines. Determining the
mass of the inner region has to rely on parametrised ﬁts of the light
curve, as we do not have nebular spectra. This has been done in
many papers (e.g., Nicholl et al. 2015). Considering the uncertain-
ties (risetime, structure of the inner ejecta), results are in general
agreement with ours.

Finally, are normal SNe Ib/c, GRB/SNe, ULGRB/SNe and
SLSNe related? They probably all originate from stripped cores of
massive stars. In the case of SNe Ib/c the light curve is dominated
by 56Ni, and the energy seems to be proportional to the mass and
the 56Ni mass (Mazzali et al. 2013). The inferred progenitor mass
rarely exceeds 25 M⊙. They may be classical neutrino-driven ex-
plosions, although the increased 56Ni mass and EK may suggest an
additional contribution to the energetics of the event, such as the in-
creasing impact of a magnetar (Mazzali et al. 2006). GRB/SNe are
more massive (35-50 M⊙), produce more 56Ni, but are also much
more energetic. While the collapsar mechanism is a serious possi-
bility (MacFadyen & Woosley 1999), the fact that all well-studied
GRB/SNe are very similar and that the EK is very nearly constant
and close to 2 × 1052 erg, the limiting energy of a magnetized neu-
tron star, suggests that magnetar energy may be the driving mech-
anism (Mazzali et al. 2014a). In this case magnetar energy would
need to be applied very early on, so that it could contribute to nu-

cleosynthesis as well as to energising the explosion. In the case of
the ULGRB/SN the GRB was so long that it may not be compat-
ible with typically assumed black hole accretion rates in the Col-
lapsar mechanism (Woosley 1993; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999;
MacFadyen et al. 2001) unless a very large mass is accreted. Thus
the magnetar energy injection scenario may be an appealing alter-
native. Finally, for classical SLSNe, the constancy of the line ve-
locity as well as the very large luminosity suggests again that mag-
netar energy plays a major role in shaping the SN ejecta. In this
case magnetar energy may not be injected immediately and may
not contribute to nucleosynthesis, although it may add EK. The EK
deduced from our models is again in line with the maximum mag-
netar energy. The delayed addition of magnetar energy may shock
the SN ejecta and produce X-rays which then give rise to the non-
thermal spectrum and the optical radiation which sustains the light
curve for a much longer time than GRB/SNe. This process may
also lead to the steep density proﬁle which is needed for the sta-
tionary lines, although this may just be explained if the explosion
was spherically symmetric, in which case magnetar energy would
act like a “piston”. Part of the reason for the extended light curve
of SLSNe is also the large mass of the SN ejecta.

The spectroscopic properties of non-interacting SLSNe reﬂect
those of SNe Ib/c. Although near peak most non-interacting SLSNe
would be classiﬁed as type Ic, He lines ofter appear after maxi-
mum, when the temperature drops, so they should be re-classiﬁed
as SNe Ib. The reason for the late appearance of the He lines is
however different in the two cases: in normal SNe Ib non-thermal
effects populating the excited levels of He I above their themal val-
ues can only happen late, when non-thermal particles can pene-
trate through the ejecta and deposit their energy in the He layer. In
SLSNe, on the other hand, the temperature near maximum, when
non-thermal effects are important for O II, is too high for He I lines,
which become strong when He starts to recombine. When they ﬁ-
nally appear, He I lines are also subject to non-thermal excitation
effects.

This leads us to making another comment: if hydrogen was
present in SLSNe it would most likely not be visible near maxi-
mum because it would be almost completely ionized. The lack of
observed H lines near maximum in SLSNe suggests that any H
content should not be very large. SLSNe with a lot of H may be-
long to the interacting class (similar to SNe IIn), while SLSNe of
type IIP may not exist because the progenitors of SLSNe may be
too massive to retain the H envelope. However, it would not be
surprising to see SLSNe showing H lines as they cool down after
maximum. These would then formally be “SLSN-IIb”, making the
“Type I” classiﬁcation inaccurate. H has recently been observed to
be present very close to the SN (Yan et al. 2015). It seems there-
fore dangerous to classify SLSNe as stripped-envelope subtypes,
or even as “Type I” or H-poor, as long as we do not have a more
complete temporal coverage of their properties. We have adopted
the deﬁnition SLSN-I in this paper for clarity, but we think this is
not a fully appropriate deﬁnition. We do however believe that non-
interacting SLSNe share the same properties as stripped-envelope
SN, as suggested by Pastorello et al. (2010).

On the other hand, GRB production seems to be agnostic
about whether the stellar explosion turns out to be a SN Ib/c or a
SLSN. If GRBs are beamed, we should expect to ﬁnd 2011kl-like
SLSN without a GRB. SN 2011kl was less luminous than ‘normal’
SLSNe, so such events may not have been discovered yet because
they are rare and too faint to be discovered optically at their typi-
cally large distances. We also should expect that there is no discon-
tinuity in luminosity between SN 2011kl and ‘typical’ SLSNe.

SLSNe are so luminous that they are unlikely to be driven
by 56Ni, but at the same time it is diffcult to determine just how
much 56Ni they contain. If a SLSN synthesised as much 56Ni as a
GRB/SN this would go almost unnoticed because the light curve
is a lot brighter. It may be expected that, if and when the con-
tribution of whatever alternative power source fades, the SN may
fall back on the 56Ni light curve, as was the case for SN 2005bf
(Maeda et al. 2007). Apart from this particular case, this has never
been observed, possibly because it is difﬁcult to follow SLSNe for
a very long time. Magnetar solutions predict a different late-time
behaviour than 56Ni solutions (see, e.g., Greiner et al. 2015), so it
is possible that the real 56Ni contribution remains hidden for a long
time. Interaction with an outside CSM, on the other hand, should
terminate at some point, and the light curve fade rapidly. The fact
that this has not been observed is another argument against the outer
CSM scenario. Very late-time observations may shed light on this,
as they did in the case of the pair-instability candidate SN 2007bi
(Gal-Yam et al. 2009), where the emission in Fe lines matches the
expectations for the 56Ni content required to power the peak of the
light curve. An additional reason to think that SN 2007bi and sim-
ilar events are not magnetar-driven SLSNe is the lack of the O II
line series despite the O-rich composition, which suggest lack of
a strong X-ray ﬂux despite the large oxygen mass inferred from
the nebular spectra. Since SN 2007bi was O-rich, this means that
X-rays from 56Ni should be less powerful than X-rays from the
shock.

We therefore may have a situation where prompt magnetar en-
ergy injection may produce nucleosynthesis in GRB/SN and help
drive the explosion. If the energy is injected later, as would be the
case for a lower magnetic ﬁeld, it would not contribute to nucle-
osynthesis, but it may be converted into radiative energy. This may
be the case for SLSNe, but also for SN 2005bf (Tominaga et al.
2005; Maeda et al. 2007), which was the result of the explosion
of a less massive star. The late excitation of the He I lines in this
case may well be a consequence of the injection of X-rays from in-
teraction with a magnetar wind, since the mass of 56Ni synthesised
was not very large (Maeda et al. 2007). It cannot be ruled out that
SLSNe commonly host ULGRBs. In this case the presence of a He
shell would probably not constitute a problem for the propagation
of the jet, because the engine is active for a very long time.

On the other hand, non-interacting SLSNe may be divided
in magnetar-driven and 56Ni-driven, and the latter may be identi-
ﬁed as PISN or massive and energetic core-collapses (Moriya et al.
2010). The presence or lack of the O II line series may be a way to
discriminate between them, as are the behaviour of the light curve
and the late-time spectrum.
