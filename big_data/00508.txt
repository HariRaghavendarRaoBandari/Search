Abstract. Let Λ be a row-ﬁnite higher-rank graph with no sources. We identify a
maximal commutative subalgebra M inside the Kumjian-Pask algebra KPR(Λ). We
also prove a generalized Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem for Kumjian-Pask algebras
which says that a representation of KPR(Λ) is injective if and only if it is injective on

1. Introduction

The Leavitt path algebra of a directed graph over a ﬁeld is a speciﬁc type of path algebra
associated to a graph modulo some relations. Leavitt path algebras were introduced in
[1] and [3], and they are the purely algebraic version of Cuntz-Krieger graph C ∗-algebras;
on the other hand, they generalize the algebras without invariant basis number studied
by Leavitt in [11]. The relationship between the algebraic and analytic theories has
been mutually beneﬁcial. Both families of algebras have proved to be rich sources of
interesting examples and have attracted interest from a broad range of researchers. In
this paper we study analogues of Leavitt path algebras associated to higher-rank graphs;
these algebras are called Kumjian-Pask algebras. Concretely we extend the results given
in [9] to Kumjian-Pask algebras.

Kumjian and Pask ﬁrst introduced the notion of a higher-rank graph or k-graph Λ (in
which paths have a k-dimensional degree and a 1-graph reduces to a directed graph) and
the associated C ∗-algebras C ∗(Λ) in [10]. These C ∗-algebras provide a visualisable model
for higher-rank versions of the Cuntz-Krieger algebras studied by Robertson and Steger
in [12]. The Kumjian-Pask algebra KPR(Λ), deﬁned and studied in [2], is an algebraic
version of C ∗(Λ). Kumjian-Pask algebras have a universal property based on a family
of generators satisfying suitable relations. The study of basic ideals and simplicity of
KPR(Λ) is done in [2], the socle and semisimplicity are considered in [4] and the center is
analysed in [5]. Kumjian-Pask algebras for more general graphs are considered in [7] and
[8].

A central topic in k-graphs algebras is to determine when a given homomorphism from
KPR(Λ) (or C ∗(Λ) in the analytic case) is injective; this is the content of the so-called
uniqueness theorems. In [2] a graded-uniqueness theorem and a Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness
theorem are proved for KPR(Λ). Both require some conditions: the ﬁrst one considers
only Zk-graded homomorphisms, while the second requires the extra hypothesis on the
graph, that is, Λ is ‘aperiodic’.

In [6], a more general version of the Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem is proved in
the C ∗-algebraic setting that has no additional hypotheses on the homomorphism or

the graph. Here we translate to Kumjian-Pask algebras the analytic result given in [6]:
a representation of KPR(Λ) is injective if and only if it is injective on a distinguished
subalgebra, called the cycline subalgebra.

At the same time we prove a more general version of the main results of [9] in the context
of 1-graphs. In [9] the second and third named authors prove a uniqueness theorem for
Leavitt path algebras which establishes that the injectivity of a representation depends
only on its injectivity on a certain commutative subalgebra [9, Theorem 5.2]. Note that
these results are not corollaries of the ones we obtain in this paper, since in [9] arbitrary
graphs are considered and here we suppose that k-graphs are row-ﬁnite with no sources.
The paper is organized as follows. We begin with a section where we give the back-
ground material, including the deﬁnition of KPR(Λ) and some basic properties. In Section
3 we establish some properties of the diagonal. In Section 4 we study the cycline subal-
gebra. Analogous to the deﬁnition given in [6], the cycline subalgebra M is generated by
elements of the form sαsβ ∗ where (α, β) ∈ Λ × Λ is a cycline pair (Proposition 4.1). In
Theorem 4.6, we prove that M is a maximal commutative subalgebra inside KPR(Λ).

Finally in Section 5 we give our main result Theorem 5.4: for Λ a row-ﬁnite k-graph
without sources, Φ : KPR(Λ) → A is an injective ring homomorphism if and only if Φ|M
is injective.

2. Preliminaries

First we give some necessary background which will be used later and we ﬁx our nota-
tion. Let k be a positive integer. We consider the additive semigroup Nk as a category
with one object. We say a countable category Λ = (Λ0, Λ, r, s) with objects Λ0, morphisms
Λ, range map r and source map s, is a k-graph if there exists a functor d : Λ → Nk, called
the degree map, satisfying the unique factorization property:
if d(λ) = m + n for some
m, n ∈ Nk, then there exist unique µ, ν ∈ Nk such that r(ν) = s(µ) and d(µ) = m,
d(ν) = n with λ = µν. Since we think of Λ as a generalized graph, we call λ ∈ Λ a path
in Λ and v ∈ Λ0 a vertex.

For n ∈ Nk deﬁne Λn = d−1({n}) and call the elements λ of Λn paths of degree n; by the
factorization property we identify Λ0 as the paths of degree 0 (or the set of vertices). For
any v ∈ Λ0 and X ⊆ Λ we denote vX = {λ ∈ X | r(λ) = v} and Xv = {λ ∈ X | s(λ) = v}.
A k-graph Λ has no sources if for all v ∈ Λ0 and n ∈ Nk the set vΛn is nonempty; Λ is
row-ﬁnite if for all v ∈ Λ0 and n ∈ Nk the set vΛn is ﬁnite. In this paper we are concerned
only with row-ﬁnite k-graphs without sources.

Example 2.1. Let E = (E0, E1, r, s) be a directed graph. Then the path category ΛE
has object set E0, and the morphisms in ΛE from v ∈ E0 to w ∈ E0 are ﬁnite paths µ
with s(µ) = v and r(µ) = w; composition is deﬁned by concatenation, and the identity
morphisms obtained by viewing the vertices as paths of length 0. With the degree functor
d : ΛE → N as the length function, the path category (ΛE, d) is a 1-graph. Note that this
requires us to use the convention where a path is a sequence of edges e1 . . . en such that
s(ei) = r(ei+1).

For m, n ∈ Nk, m ≤ n means mi ≤ ni for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k and m ∨ n denotes the pointwise

maximum.

k = Nk, Ωk = {(p, q) ∈ Nk × Nk : p ≤ q}, deﬁne r, s : Ωk → Ω0
Example 2.2. Let Ω0
k
by r(p, q) = p and s(p, q) = q, deﬁne composition by (p, q)(q, r) = (p, r), and deﬁne
d : Ωk → Nk by d(p, q) = q − p. Then Ωk = (Ωk, r, s, d) is a k-graph.

An inﬁnite path in Λ is a degree-preserving functor x : Ωk → Λ. We denote the set of
all inﬁnite paths by Λ∞. We denote x(0, 0) by r(x) and refer to this vertex as the range
of x.

For µ ∈ Λ deﬁne the cylinder set

Z(µ) := {x ∈ Λ∞ | x(0, d(µ)) = µ}.

For α ∈ Λ and x ∈ Z(s(α)), deﬁne αx to be the unique inﬁnite path such that for any
n ≥ d(α), we have that (αx)(0, n) = α(x(0, n − d(α))). We denote Z(α) by αΛ∞ when
α is a vertex. The collection of cylinder sets is a basis of compact sets for a Hausdorﬀ
topology on Λ∞ (see [10, Proposition 2.8]).

For p ∈ Nk we deﬁne a map σp : Λ∞ → Λ∞ by σp(x)(m, n) = x(m + p, n + p) for every

x ∈ Λ∞, (m, n) ∈ Ωk. Note that by unique factorization x = x(0, p)σp(x).

We say that a path x ∈ Λ∞ is periodic if there exists p 6= q ∈ Nk such that σp(x) = σq(x).
That is, for all m, n ∈ Nk x(m + p, n + p) = x(m + q, n + q). If x is not periodic, we say
x is aperiodic. A row-ﬁnite k-graph with no sources is called aperiodic if for every vertex
v ∈ Λ0, there exists an aperiodic path in vΛ∞.

If Λ is a k-graph, we let Λ6=0 := {λ ∈ Λ : d(λ) 6= 0}. For each λ ∈ Λ6=0 we introduce a
ghost path λ∗ and for v ∈ Λ0 deﬁne v∗ := v. We write G(Λ) for the set of ghost paths, or
G(Λ6=0) if we wish to exclude vertices. We deﬁne d, r and s on G(Λ) by d(λ∗) = −d(λ),
r(λ∗) = s(λ), s(λ∗) = r(λ); we then deﬁne composition on G(Λ) by setting λ∗µ∗ = (µλ)∗
for λ, µ ∈ Λ6=0 with r(µ∗) = s(λ∗). The factorization property of Λ induces a similar
factorization property on G(Λ).

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let Λ be a row-ﬁnite k-graph without sources and let R be a commutative
ring with 1. A Kumjian-Pask Λ-family (P, S) in an R-algebra A consists of two functions
P : Λ0 → A and S : Λ6=0 ∪ G(Λ6=0) → A such that:
(KP1) {Pv : v ∈ Λ0} is a family of mutually orthogonal idempotents;
(KP2) for all λ, µ ∈ Λ6=0 with r(µ) = s(λ), we have

SλSµ = Sλµ, Sµ∗Sλ∗ = S(λµ)∗, Pr(λ)Sλ = Sλ = SλPs(λ), Ps(λ)Sλ∗ = Sλ∗ = Sλ∗Pr(λ);

(KP3) for all λ, µ ∈ Λ6=0 with d(λ) = d(µ), we have Sλ∗Sµ = δλ,µPs(λ); and

(KP4) for all v ∈ Λ0 and all n ∈ Nk \ {0}, we have Pv =Pλ∈vΛn SλSλ∗.

In [2, Theorem 3.4] it is proved that there is an R-algebra KPR(Λ) generated by a
Kumjian-Pask Λ-family (p, s) with the following universal property: whenever (Q, T ) is
a Kumjian-Pask Λ-family in an R-algebra A, there is a unique R-algebra homomorphism
πQ,T : KPR(Λ) → A such that πQ,T (pv) = Qv, πQ,T (sλ) = Tλ, πQ,T (sµ∗) = Tµ∗ for v ∈ Λ0
and λ, µ ∈ Λ6=0. We call KPR(Λ) the Kumjian-Pask algebra of Λ and the generating
family (p, s) the universal Kumjian-Pask family.

With the convention that sv = pv and sv∗ = pv it follows from the Kumjian-Pask

relations (KP1)-(KP4) that

KPR(Λ) = spanR{sµsν ∗ : µ, ν ∈ Λ with s(µ) = s(ν)},

4

and sµsν ∗ 6= 0 in KPR(Λ) if s(µ) = s(ν). For every nonzero a ∈ KPR(Λ) and n ∈ Nk there
exist m ≥ n and a ﬁnite subset F ⊆ Λ × Λm such that s(α) = s(β) for all (α, β) ∈ F and

a = X(α,β)∈F

rα,βsαsβ ∗

with rα,β ∈ R \ {0}.
Lemma 4.2]. We can deﬁne an R-linear involution a 7→ a∗ on KPR(Λ) as follows:

In this situation, we say that a is written in normal form [2,
if

a =P(α,β)∈F rα,βsαsβ ∗ then a∗ =P(α,β)∈F rα,βsβsα∗.

It is proved in [2, Theorem 3.4] that KPR(Λ) is graded by Zk such that for each n ∈ Zk,

KPR(Λ)n = spanR{sλsµ∗ : λ, µ ∈ Λ and d(λ) − d(µ) = n}.

[2, Theorem 3.4] also says that rpv 6= 0 for v ∈ Λ0 and r ∈ R \ {0}.

3. The diagonal subalgebra

In this section we establish some properties of the diagonal subalgebra D of the Kumjian-

Pask algebra KPR(Λ). Deﬁne

D := hsµsµ∗ : µ ∈ Λi;

that is, D is the R-subalgebra of KPR(Λ) generated by the set {sµsµ∗ : µ ∈ Λ}. Observe
that for v ∈ Λ0, svsv∗ = pv.

Lemma 3.1. The diagonal subalgebra D is commutative.

Proof. Using the Kumjian-Pask relations it follows that for each n, {sµsµ∗ : µ ∈ Λn}
is a set of mutually orthogonal idempotents (see [2, Remarks 3.2]). Now if we consider
λ, µ ∈ Λ then by [2, Lemma 3.3], for each q ≥ d(λ) ∨ d(µ) we have that

sλ∗sµ = Xd(λα)=q, λα=µβ

sαsβ ∗.

Then (sλsλ∗)(sµsµ∗) = (sµsµ∗)(sλsλ∗) because:

(sλsλ∗)(sµsµ∗) = sλ(sλ∗sµ)sµ∗

sαsβ ∗)sµ∗

sλsαsβ ∗sµ∗

= sλ( Xd(λα)=q, λα=µβ
= Xd(λα)=q, λα=µβ
= Xd(λα)=q, λα=µβ
= Xd(µβ)=q, µβ=λα
= Xd(µβ)=q, µβ=λα

sβsα∗)sλ∗

= sµ( Xd(µβ)=q, µβ=λα

= sµ(sµ∗sλ)sλ∗
= (sµsµ∗)(sλsλ∗).

So D is commutative.

Remark 3.2. Observe that

In particular if d(γ) = d(η), then

sαγs(αγ)∗ sαsβ ∗sβηs(βη)∗ = sαγsγ ∗sηs(βη)∗ .

sαγs(αγ)∗ sαsβ ∗sβηs(βη)∗ =(sαγs(βγ)∗

0

if γ = η,
otherwise.

(cid:3)

We may view elements of the diagonal D as functions from Λ∞ to R in the following
way. For µ ∈ Λ let 1Z(µ) denote the characteristic function association to Z(µ). That is,
1Z(µ) : Λ∞ → R such that

Let

1Z(µ)(x) =(1

0

if x ∈ Z(µ),
otherwise.

AD := spanR{1Z(µ) : µ ∈ Λ}.

Then AD as an R-algebra with addition and scalar multiplication deﬁned pointwise and
multiplication of the generators is given by

1Z(µ) · 1Z(ν) = 1Z(µ)∩Z(ν).

Remark 3.3. In fact AD is the diagonal of the Steinberg algebra associated to Λ (see
Section 5 of [8] for more details).

The following lemma follows from [8, Proposition 5.4]:

Lemma 3.4. The map π : D → AD such that π(sµsµ∗) = 1Z(µ) is an isomorphism.

Lemma 3.5. Let µ, ν ∈ Λ with s(µ) = s(ν) and r ∈ R such that rsµsµ∗ = rsνsν ∗ . Then
sµsµ∗ = sνsν ∗.

Proof. Let π : D → AD. Then π(rsµsµ∗) = π(rsνsν ∗). Therefore we have r1Z(µ) = r1Z(ν),
which implies Z(µ) = Z(ν). This means sµsµ∗ = sνsν ∗ because the map π of Lemma 3.4
is injective.
(cid:3)

4. The cycline subalgebra

We study a special class of generators for KPR(Λ) which will be used in the construction
of a distinguished subalgebra, called the cycline subalgebra of KPR(Λ). First an element
a ∈ KPR(Λ) is said to be normal if aa∗ = a∗a. The proof of the following proposition
follows exactly as the one given in [6, Proposition 4.1]. Note that in [6, Proposition 4.1],
they write Pα for the projection sαsα∗.

Proposition 4.1. Let Λ be a row-ﬁnite k-graph with no sources and R be a commutative
ring with 1. Then for (α, β) ∈ Λ × Λ with s(α) = s(β), the following conditions are
equivalent:

(1) sαγs(αγ)∗ = sβγs(βγ)∗ for all γ ∈ s(α)Λ;
(2) sαsβ ∗ is normal and commutes with D; and
(3) αγ = βγ for all γ ∈ s(α)Λ∞.

Deﬁnition 4.2. A pair (α, β) ∈ Λ × Λ with s(α) = s(β) satisfying the equivalent condi-
tions of Proposition 4.1 is called a cycline pair. Deﬁne

M := hsαsβ ∗ : (α, β) cyclinei;

that is, the R-subalgebra of KPR(Λ) generated by the cycline pairs. We call M the cycline
subalgebra of the Kumjian-Pask algebra KPR(Λ).

Remark 4.3. Observe that (α, α) is cycline and hence D ⊆ M. Also (α, β) is cycline if
and only if (β, α) is. For (α, β), (µ, ν) ∈ Λ × Λ and n ∈ Nk, n ≥ d(α) ∨ d(β) we have

(1)

sαsβ ∗sµsν ∗ =

Xγ,η∈Λ, βγ=µη, d(βγ)=n

sαγs(νη)∗ .

If (α, β), (µ, ν) are cycline and λ ∈ s(γ)Λ, then

sνηλs(νηλ)∗ = sµηλs(µηλ)∗ = sβγλs(βγλ)∗ = sαγλs(αγλ)∗ .

This means that the pairs (αγ, νη) appearing in the right hand side of (1) are cycline too
by Proposition 4.1 (1).

Lemma 4.4. The cycline subalgebra M is commutative.

Proof. Let (α, β) and (µ, ν) be two cycline pairs. It suﬃces to show that

(sαsβ ∗)(sµsν ∗) = (sµsν ∗)(sαsβ ∗).

Now

sαsβ ∗ sµsν ∗ = Xβγ=µη

sαγs(νη)∗

= Xβγ=µη, νη=αγ
= Xβγ=µη, νη=αγ
= Xβγ=µη, νη=αγ
= Xβγ=µη, νη=αγ
= Xβγ=µη, νη=αγ

sαγ (s(αγ)∗sνη) s(νη)∗ by (KP3)

(sαγs(αγ)∗ ) (sνηs(νη)∗ )

(sβγs(βγ)∗) (sµηs(µη)∗ ) since (α, β) and (µ, ν) are cycline

(sµηs(µη)∗ ) (sβγs(βγ)∗) since D is commutative

sµη (s(µη)∗ sβγ) s(βγ)∗

sµηs(βγ)∗

= Xνη=αγ

= sµsν ∗ sαsβ ∗ as desired.

(cid:3)

In [6, Example 4.9], it is seen that a standard
Remark 4.5. Let E be a 1-graph.
generator sαsβ ∗ is cycline if and only if α = β, α = βc or β = αc for some cycle c ∈
s(α)Es(α) without entry. Thus the cycline subalgebra M coincides with the commutative
core MR(E) deﬁned in [9, Deﬁnition 3.15].

Deﬁne D′ such that

(2)

D′ := {a ∈ KPR(Λ) : ad = da for every d ∈ D}.

Notice that we have the inclusions D ⊆ M ⊆ D′, where the second inclusion comes from
Proposition 4.1 (2). In fact, M = D if Λ is aperiodic (see Lemma 5.5). Our main goal in
this section is to prove the following.

Theorem 4.6. Let Λ be a row-ﬁnite k-graph with no sources, R be a commutative ring
with 1, M be the cycline subalgebra and D′ be deﬁned as in (2). Then M = D′. In
particular, M is a maximal commutative subalgebra of KPR(Λ).

To prove Theorem 4.6, we establish three lemmas. Recall that KPR(Λ) is a Zk-graded

algebra such that for n ∈ Zk,

KPR(Λ)n = spanR{sλsµ∗ : λ, µ ∈ Λ and d(λ) − d(µ) = n}.

Lemma 4.7. Let a ∈ D′ and suppose a = P(α,β)∈F rα,βsαsβ ∗ is in normal form. Then

for any (α, β) ∈ F , rα,βsαsβ ∗ ∈ D′.

Proof. First we claim that a ∈ D′ if and only if an ∈ D′ for all n ∈ Zk, where an is the
homogeneous part of a of degree n. To prove the claim note if for all n ∈ Zk, an ∈ D′
then a ∈ D′. Assume that a ∈ D′. Then for any d ∈ D, ad = da. Since elements of D are
homogeneous of degree zero then and = (ad)n. Then

and = (ad)n = (da)n = dan,

and so an ∈ D′ for every n ∈ Zk.

Thus to prove the lemma, we can assume that a is homogeneous of degree n. Since all β
have the same degree, then all α have the same degree. For every (γ, δ) ∈ F , sγsγ ∗ ∈ D and
sδsδ∗ ∈ D so then sγsγ ∗asδsδ∗ ∈ D′. By (KP3) we have, sγsγ ∗asδsδ∗ = rγ,δsγsδ∗ ∈ D′. (cid:3)

In the following lemma we adopt some ideas from [13, Lemma 3.2].

Lemma 4.8. Let µ, ν ∈ Λ with s(µ) = s(ν) and r ∈ R \ {0} such that rsµsν ∗ ∈ D′. Then
sµsµ∗ = sνsν ∗.

Proof. First since rsµsν ∗ ∈ D′ we have rsµsµ∗sµsν ∗ = rsµsν ∗sµsµ∗, that is, rsµsν ∗ =
rsµsν ∗sµsµ∗. Then multiplying both sides of this equation by sµ∗ on the left, we get
rsµ∗sµsν ∗ = rsµ∗sµsν ∗sµsµ∗, which means by (KP3) that rsν ∗ = rsν ∗sµsµ∗. Finally multi-
plying by sν again on the left gives,

rsνsν ∗ = rsνsν ∗sµsµ∗.

8

LISA ORLOFF CLARK, CRIST ´OBAL GIL CANTO, AND ALIREZA NASR-ISFAHANI

Since rsµsν ∗ ∈ D′, we have rsνsµ∗ ∈ D′. Using the same argument we get

Now sνsν ∗, sµsµ∗ ∈ D and D is commutative so

rsµsµ∗ = rsµsµ∗sνsν ∗.

rsµsµ∗ = rsµsµ∗sνsν ∗ = rsνsν ∗sµsµ∗ = rsνsν ∗.

That is, rsµsµ∗ = rsνsν ∗. Finally by Lemma 3.5 we obtain sµsµ∗ = sνsν ∗.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.9. Let µ, ν ∈ Λ with s(µ) = s(ν) and r ∈ R \ {0} such that rsµsν ∗ ∈ D′. Then
(µ, ν) is a cycline pair.

Proof. Let γ ∈ s(µ)Λ. We show sµγs(µγ)∗ = sνγs(νγ)∗. Because rsµsν ∗ ∈ D′, rsνsµ∗ ∈ D′.
So, on the one hand, we have:

(rsµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)(sµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)∗ = (sµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)(rsνsµ∗)sµγs(µγ)∗
= (sµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)sµγs(µγ)∗ (rsνsµ∗)
= sµγs(µγ)∗ (rsµsν ∗)sµγs(µγ)∗ sνsµ∗
= sµγs(µγ)∗ sµγs(µγ)∗(rsµsν ∗)sνsµ∗
= rsµγs(µγ)∗ sµsµ∗.

On the other hand,

(sµγs(µγ)∗sµsν ∗)∗(rsµγs(µγ)∗sµsν ∗) = (rsνsµ∗)sµγs(µγ)∗ sµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗

= sµγs(µγ)∗ (rsνsµ∗)sµsν ∗
= rsµγs(µγ)∗sνsν ∗.

But by Lemma 4.8, rsµsν ∗ ∈ D′ implies sµsµ∗ = sνsν ∗. Therefore

(3)

(rsµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)(sµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)∗ = (sµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)∗(rsµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗).

Now:

rsµγs(µγ)∗ = (rsµγs(µγ)∗sµsν ∗)(sµγs(µγ)∗sµsν ∗)∗

= (sµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗)∗(rsµγs(µγ)∗ sµsν ∗) by (3)
= rsνγs(νγ)∗.

Hence rsµγs(µγ)∗ = rsνγs(νγ)∗ and by Lemma 3.5, we obtain

sµγs(µγ)∗ = sνγs(νγ)∗.

Thus by Proposition 4.1 (1), (µ, ν) is a cycline pair.

(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove the main result of this section.

Proof of Theorem 4.6. To see that M = D′, we show D′ ⊆ M. Let a ∈ D′. Suppose a is
written in normal form

By Lemma 4.7, for each (α, β) ∈ F we have rα,βsαsβ ∗ ∈ D′. Now we apply Lemma 4.9 to
see that each (α, β) in F is a cycline pair. Thus a ∈ M.

a = X(α,β)∈F

rα,βsαsβ ∗

In order to prove that M is a maximal commutative subalgebra inside KPR(Λ), ﬁrst
recall that M is commutative by Lemma 4.4. Now consider C a commutative subalgebra
of KPR(Λ) such that M ⊆ C. Since we have D ⊆ M ⊆ C then in particular

C ⊆ {x ∈ KPR(Λ) : xd = dx for every d ∈ D} = D′.

Therefore C = M.

(cid:3)

The following corollary involving the center of a Kumjian-Pask algebra, (studied in [5])

is immediate.

Corollary 4.10. Let Λ be a row-ﬁnite k-graph with no sources and R be a commutative
ring with 1. Then the center of the Kumjian-Pask algebra

Z(KPR(Λ)) := {a ∈ KPR(Λ) : ax = xa for every x ∈ KPR(Λ)} ⊆ M.

5. General uniqueness theorem for Kumjian-Pask algebras

In this section we give a new uniqueness theorem for Kumjian-Pask algebras that says a
homomorphism on KPR(Λ) is injective if and only if it is injective on the cycline subalgebra
M. First we adapt some of the technical innovations from [6] to our setting.

For any subset U ⊆ X of a topological space X we denote its interior by Int(U) and its
boundary by ∂U. The following deﬁnition appears in [6, Deﬁnition 5.2]. For a k-graph
Λ, deﬁne

Σ := {(α, β) ∈ Λ × Λ | s(α) = s(β), α 6= β}.

Then for any pair (α, β) ∈ Σ let

Fα,β := {x ∈ Λ∞ | x ∈ Z(α) ∩ Z(β) and σd(α)(x) = σd(β)(x)}.

We deﬁne the set of regular paths in Λ∞ to be

TΛ := Λ∞ − [(α,β)∈Σ

∂Fα,β.

Remark 5.1. In this remark we recall some properties of Fα,β and TΛ, which are given
in [6, Section 5].

(a) We have Fα,β = Fβ,α.
(b) We have that Fα,β is closed for all (α, β) ∈ Σ. Indeed if xi → x in Λ∞ and n ∈ Nk
then σn(xi) → σn(x); in particular if xi ∈ Fα,β for all i then x(0, d(α)) = α,
x(0, d(β)) = β and σd(α)(x) = σd(β)(x), so x ∈ Fα,β. Therefore, ∂Fα,β ⊆ Fα,β.
Note that ∂Fα,β is also closed.

(c) The set TΛ is dense in Λ∞ (by the Baire Category Theorem). So for every v ∈ Λ0

there exists an x ∈ Z(v) ∩ TΛ.
(d) We have TΛ ∩ Fα,β ⊆ Int(Fα,β).
(e) The cylinder set Z(µ) ⊆ Fα,β if and only if Z(νµ) ⊆ Fνα,νβ.
(f) If x ∈ TΛ and ν ∈ Λr(x), then νx ∈ TΛ.
(g) If x ∈ TΛ and n ∈ Nk, then σn(x) ∈ TΛ.

Remark 5.2. Let E be a 1-graph. An inﬁnite path in E is called essentially aperiodic
if it is either aperiodic or of the form µccc · · · , where c is a cycle without entry (see [9,
Deﬁnition 3.5 (B)] for more details). In [6, Example 5.4], it is seen that TE is the set of
essentially aperiodic paths of E.

The next lemma corresponds to [6, Lemma 5.8] and the proof translates exactly (so we

omit it).

Lemma 5.3. For (α, β) ∈ Σ and x ∈ TΛ we have the following:

(a) If x /∈ Fα,β, then there exists µ, ν ∈ Λ such that x ∈ Z(µ) ∩ Z(ν) and

sµsµ∗sαsβ ∗sνsν ∗ = 0.

(b) If x ∈ Fα,β, then there exists γ ∈ Λ with x ∈ Z(αγ) ∩ Z(βγ),

sαγs(αγ)∗sαsβ ∗sβγs(βγ)∗ = sαγs(βγ)∗, and (αγ, βγ) cycline.

Theorem 5.4. Let Λ be a row-ﬁnite k-graph with no sources, R be a commutative ring
with 1 and M be the cycline subalgebra of KPR(Λ).
If Φ : KPR(Λ) → A is a ring
homomorphism, then Φ is injective if and only if Φ|M is injective.

Proof. We show that Φ|M injective implies Φ injective. By way of contradiction suppose
we have 0 6= a ∈ KPR(Λ) such that a ∈ Ker Φ. Applying [4, Lemma 2.3 (i)] (and writing
the sum involved in normal form) we can ﬁnd (δ, ǫ) ∈ Λ × Λ such that

0 6= sδ∗asǫ = rδ,ǫps(δ) + X(α,β)∈F, d(α)6=d(β)

rα,βsαsβ ∗,

where in particular rδ,ǫ 6= 0. Let b := sδ∗asǫ 6= 0. Notice that b ∈ Ker Φ because Ker Φ is
an ideal of KPR(Λ). Now by Remark 5.1 (c), ﬁx x ∈ Z(s(δ)) ∩ TΛ. For each (α, β) ∈ F
we have two possibilities:

• If x /∈ Fα,β, then there exists µ = µα,β, ν = να,β ∈ Λ as in Lemma 5.3(a) such that

x ∈ Z(µ) ∩ Z(ν) and

sµsµ∗sαsβ ∗sνsν ∗ = 0.

• Otherwise, if x ∈ Fα,β then there exists γ = γα,β ∈ Λ as in Lemma 5.3(b) such

that x ∈ Z(αγ) ∩ Z(βγ) and

sαγs(αγ)∗ sαsβ ∗sβγs(βγ)∗ = sαγs(βγ)∗ with (αγ, βγ) cycline.

Now let m be the following product:

( Y(α,β)∈F, x∈Fα,β

sαγs(αγ)∗ )( Y(α,β)∈F, x /∈Fα,β

sµsµ∗) b ( Y(α,β)∈F, x /∈Fα,β

sνsν ∗)( Y(α,β)∈F, x∈Fα,β

sβγs(βγ)∗)

Observe that every sαγs(αγ)∗, sβγs(βγ)∗, sµsµ∗, sνsν ∗ is inside D. We have that m ∈ M

by construction. Since b ∈ Ker Φ, we have m ∈ Ker Φ.

Let us see that m 6= 0: we show that the zero-graded component of m is non-zero, that

is, m0 6= 0. We have

m = (Y sαγs(αγ)∗)(Y sµsµ∗) rδ,ǫps(δ) (Y sνsν ∗)(Y sβγs(βγ)∗) + m′,

where

We claim that

rα,βsαsβ ∗) (Y sνsν ∗)(Y sβγs(βγ)∗).
m′ = (Y sαγs(αγ)∗)(Y sµsµ∗) ( Xd(α)6=d(β)
m0 = (Y sαγs(αγ)∗ )(Y sµsµ∗) rδ,ǫps(δ) (Y sνsν ∗)(Y sβγs(βγ)∗ ) ∈ D.

To see this, consider (Q sαγs(αγ)∗)(Q sµsµ∗) rα,βsαsβ ∗ (Q sνsν ∗)(Q sβγs(βγ)∗ ) a term in
m′. Since Q sαγs(αγ)∗ ,Q sµsµ∗,Q sνsν ∗,Q sβγs(βγ)∗ are each 0-graded,

(Y sαγs(αγ)∗)(Y sµsµ∗) rα,βsαsβ ∗ (Y sνsν ∗)(Y sβγs(βγ)∗)

is d(α) − d(β) 6= 0 graded. Thus m0 is as claimed.

Recall from Lemma 3.4, we have an isomorphism π : D → AD. To see that m0 6= 0, it

suﬃces to show π(m0) 6= 0. Now

π(m0) = rδ,ǫ(Y 1Z(αγ))(Y 1Z(µ) 1Z(s(δ))) (Y 1Z(ν))(Y 1Z(βγ))

= rδ,ǫ1U

where

U =(cid:16)\ Z(αγ)(cid:17) ∩(cid:16)\ Z(µ)(cid:17) ∩ Z(s(δ)) ∩(cid:16)\ Z(ν)(cid:17) ∩(cid:16)\ Z(βγ)(cid:17) .

By construction x ∈ U and hence 1U 6= 0. So π(m0) 6= 0 and ﬁnally m 6= 0 as desired.

This contradicts the assumption that Φ|M is injective because we found 0 6= m ∈ M
(cid:3)

and m ∈ Ker Φ. Therefore Φ is injective.

From Theorem 5.4 we can recover the usual Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem given in
[2, Theorem 4.7]. First we need to consider the following lemma which is proved similarly
to [6, Proposition 4.8].

Lemma 5.5. If Λ is aperiodic, then (α, β) is a cycline pair if and only if α = β. In
particular, M = D.

Corollary 5.6. Let Λ be an aperiodic row-ﬁnite k-graph without sources and R be a
commutative ring with 1.
If Φ : KPR(Λ) → A is a ring homomorphism, then Φ is
injective if and only if Φ(rpv) 6= 0 for all r ∈ R \ {0} and v ∈ Λ0.
Proof. We verify that Φ(rpv) 6= 0 for all r ∈ R \ {0} and v ∈ Λ0 implies Φ is injective. We
show Φ|M is injective, which suﬃces by Theorem 5.4. First, by Lemma 5.5, M = D. By
way of contradiction suppose there exist r ∈ R \ {0} and λ ∈ Λ such that Φ(rsλsλ∗) = 0.
But then Φ(sλ∗(rsλsλ∗)sλ) = 0. Thus Φ(rps(λ)) = 0, which is a contradiction.
