A canonical rate-independent model of geometrically linear isotropic

gradient plasticity with isotropic hardening and plastic spin accounting

for the Burgers vector

Fran¸cois Ebobisse1 and Klaus Hackl2 and Patrizio Neﬀ3

March 2, 2016

Abstract

In this paper we propose a canonical variational framework for rate-independent phe-
nomenological geometrically linear gradient plasticity with plastic spin. The model combines
the additive decomposition of the total distortion into non-symmetric elastic and plastic dis-
tortions, with a defect energy contribution taking account of the Burgers vector through
a dependence only on the dislocation density tensor Curl p giving rise to a non-symmetric
nonlocal backstress, and isotropic hardening response only depending on the accumulated
equivalent plastic strain. The model is fully isotropic and satisﬁes linearized gauge-invariance
conditions, i.e., only true state-variables appear. The model satisﬁes also the principle of
maximum dissipation which allows to show existence for the weak formulation. For this
result, a recently introduced Korn’s inequality for incompatible tensor ﬁelds is necessary.
Uniqueness is shown in the class of strong solutions. For vanishing energetic length scale,
the model reduces to classical elasto-plasticity with symmetric plastic strain εp and standard
isotropic hardening.

Since the celebrated work of Tresca [113], classical plasticity has been cast within the years into
a beautiful framework in which both theoretical and computational aspects were examined (see
e.g. [66, 71, 7, 106, 55, 110, 22]). Even perfect classical plasticity has been recently revived by
[22, 34, 35] with the use of the energetic approach for rate-independent processes developed by
[74, 75].

On the other hand, a number of experimental results have shown size-dependencies for
the material behaviour in small scales (micron/meso) (see e.g.
[30, 108]). However, classical
plasticity models are scale independent and therefore cannot capture those size-eﬀects. This has

Canonical gradient plasticity with plastic spin

led in the last thirty years to an abundant literature ([1, 2, 78, 31, 5, 41, 39, 43, 45, 32, 33, 101])
on theories of gradient plasticity with the aim of accommodating the experimentally observed
size eﬀects mentioned above. The so-called energetic and dissipative length scales have been
involved. Moreover, eﬀort has also been made in the past years to provide mathematical results
for the initial boundary values problems and inequalities describing some models of gradient
plasticity (see for instance, [24, 103, 26, 83, 27, 38, 91, 92, 28]). Several contributions on the
computational aspects have been made as well ([25, 90, 14, 104]).

In most of the above-mentioned models of gradient plasticity, the plastic rotation has been
ignored. If a polycrystal is treated as a randomly oriented collection of grains, it is clear that the
plastic distortion p, which must then be seen as the average slip over all glide planes, will be non-
symmetric. Therefore, plastic spin is a reality also in polycrystalline modelling. The situation is
less clear when one aims at an overall eﬀective phenomenological description in which individual
glide planes are not resolved. It is possible to show that in a purely local isotropic theory the
plastic spin can be suppressed without loss of generality. The situation is again diﬀerent in
gradient-plasticity extensions, in which it is generally agreed that plastic spin is automatically
included (e.g. [41]). However, no agreement has been reached on how to precisely include the
eﬀect of plastic spin. Our contribution aims at proposing a canonical framework to do exactly
this. In [41, 11, 12, 100] models discussing the role of the plastic rotation have been proposed.
For instance, [100] discusses the need to incorporate the plastic rotation in an isotropic gradient
plasticity framework in order to capture some eﬀects of a crystallographic model for a large
collection of grains in a polycrystal. In the mathematical context, existence results for models
with plastic spin have also been obtained ([83, 27, 28]).
The modelling challenge which we faced in the past can be explained as follows. Given the
additive decomposition of the total non-symmetric distortion (the displacement gradient ∇u),
is it possible to write down a model with plastic spin (the plastic distortion p is not symmetric)
and allow for a defect energy depending on Nye’s dislocation density tensor Curl p together with
an isotropic hardening response which is, however, only driven by the accumulated equivalent

0(cid:107)˙εp(cid:107) ds, and cast all that in the suitable convex variational

plastic strain γp =(cid:82) t

0(cid:107)sym ˙p(cid:107) ds =(cid:82) t

framework of the principle of maximum dissipation? In Section 3 we present exactly such a
model. Our previous attempts of modelling in this direction were based on the (rate-explicit)
dual ﬂow rule but failed to satisfy the principle of maximum dissipation, [46, p. 454], see also
[48, 97, 19, 49].1

The new model proposed in this paper, which involves only one energetic length scale Lc
has some features which make it stand out from other proposals in rate-independent gradient
plasticity with plastic spin as:

• it allows for plastic spin in a most transparent manner: for vanishing characteristic ener-
getic length scale Lc → 0, the plastic spin vanishes as well and the model turns into classi-
cal elasto-plasticity with symmetric plastic strain εp = sym p and with isotropic hardening
0(cid:107)˙εp(cid:107) ds;

based only on the accumulated equivalent plastic strain γp =(cid:82) t

0(cid:107)sym ˙p(cid:107) ds =(cid:82) t

• it is completely isotropic and (linearized) frame-indiﬀerent;

1It is often assumed that the plastic evolution ˙p associated with a state of yield maximizes the dissipation

relative to all admissible states. This is also equivalent to I’liushin’s postulate ([67]).

• it is (linearized) gauge-invariant: this means that it satisﬁes invariance under compatible
transformations of the reference system, i.e., in the linearized context it is invariant under

∇u(x) −→ ∇u(x) + ∇ϑp(x) ∀ϑp ∈ C1(R3, R3)
p(x) −→ p(x) + ∇ϑp(x)

,

which is also known as translational T(3)-gauge invariance ([63, 64, 65, 29]);

• it contains only properly deﬁned state-variables ([105, 29]). In this context, notice that, as
mentioned in De Wit [23, p.1478]: ”. . . the plastic strain [sym p] is not a state quantity, i.e.,
it cannot be determined from the [current] state of the body.” Through a proper deﬁnition
of inﬁnitesimal state-variables, this will be clearly presented in [29].

In this model, the hardening type response is depending on a (nonlocal) kinematic term
which is the non-symmetric backstress contribution µ L2
c Curl Curl p, solely responsible for the
appearance of plastic spin or not and related to the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND)
density distribution. The isotropic hardening is related to statistically stored dislocations (SSD),
which take into account a ”plastically homogeneous” eﬀect as they accumulate already during a
macroscopically homogeneous deformation. Here, the SSD evolution is modelled by two isotropic

hardening variables γp =(cid:82) t

0(cid:107)sym ˙p(cid:107) ds and ωp =(cid:82) t

0(cid:107)skew ˙p(cid:107) ds. Hence, the full plastic distortion,

and not only its symmetric part, may contribute to hardening. This is in accordance with the
physical nature of plastic ﬂow since also the evolution of the skew-symmetric part of p indicates
dislocation motion.
It is noteworthy that classical linear Prager-type kinematical hardening
cannot be accommodated in the ”state-variable” approach adopted here since the corresponding
backstress contribution εp = sym p as such is not a state-variable (see e.g. [95, 105]).

Notwithstanding the use of the dislocation density tensor Curl p, we claim that our model is
properly isotropic. In passing, notice that taking Curl εp = Curl sym p is physically inadmissible
since Curl εp is not a defect measure for εp ∈ Sym(3). Rather, one should then take Kr¨oner’s
incompatibility tensor inc εp := Curl [(Curl εp)T ]. The possibilities to do exactly this will be
explained in the forthcoming paper [29]. On the other hand, claims in the recent literature
[107]2 that dependencies of a model on the dislocation density tensor Curl p exclude isotropy
will also be critically examined in [29].

It is sometimes argued that plastic spin is irrelevant in the case of isotropy ([61]).3 The
question whether one needs a theory with plastic spin is just the question whether one can work
with a symmetric plastic strain tensor εp as the only variable in a phenomenological plasticity
theory. Our development clearly shows that claims such as in [61] are unfounded and seem to
indicate that there are diﬀerent notions involved of what isotropy precisely means. This subject
will also be discussed further in [29].

We call spin cross-hardening the situation where plastic ﬂow in the plastic strain εp = sym p
causes hardening in the plastic rotation evolution of skew p and vice-versa. In our model we see

2Steigmann and Gupta [107, p.410] put forward that: ”... the dislocation density [tensor] Curl p is well-deﬁned
under symmetry transformations only if the symmetry group is discrete.” From that they conclude that it is not
possible to obtain an isotropic plasticity model including Curl p.

3Krishnan and Steigmann [61, p.722] argue that plastic spin associated with a ﬂow rule for plastic evolution
can be suppressed in the isotropic case without loss of generality. We understand that this is only true for the
local theory, i.e., Lc = 0 as conﬁrmed in [46, p.511].

Canonical gradient plasticity with plastic spin

that spin cross-hardening does not take place, i.e., only the accumulated equivalent plastic strain
inﬂuences hardening in the evolution of the plastic strain and only the accumulated equivalent
plastic rotation inﬂuences hardening in the evolution of the plastic rotation.

A remark concerning the mathematical treatment of single crystal plasticity is also in order.
First, it is clear that such a theory is also a phenomenological model, albeit on a diﬀerent
scale. In the single crystal case the assumption of diﬀerent glide systems lead to an immediate
anisotropy of plastic ﬂow and plastic spin is automatically included. However, the dislocation
density contribution, when looked at it in detail, leads to a full gradient control of the plastic slip
on each glide-plane. Therefore, the nonsymmetric plastic distortion p, which is the combined
plastic slip on each glide plane, is automatically controlled in the standard Sobolev space H 1(Ω)
([102, 14]). By contrast, our isotropic framework means to give up detailed control of the
plastic distortion due to additional invariance conditions that have to be respected. The eﬀect
is that there is not even an immediate H(Curl )-control of the plastic distortion. Therefore, the
mathematically more challenging model is, without any doubt, the isotropic dislocation-based
model with plastic spin treated here.

Notice that there are some similarities between our new isotropic model and the early one
proposed by Gurtin [41]. In fact, both models share: a complete isotropic formulation, decou-
pled evolution equations into symmetric and skew-symmetric rates (isotropic hardening possibly
coming from both), a dissipation depending also on plastic spin, the same defect and elastic ener-
gies, only an energetic length scale connected to the dislocation density tensor and both reduce
to classical plasticity when the energetic length scale is zero. Now, there are also nontrivial
diﬀerences between the two models. In fact, the model in [41] is visco-plastic, includes local
nonsymmetric kinematical backstress due to dissipative viscoplastic hardening, it is not cast
into a variational framework and does not have existence results so far. Also the model in [41]
involves a novel microforce balance as well as boundary conditions on the moving elastic-plastic
boundary4 and a dissipation function depending also on the gradient of the plastic distortion
rate (see also [93]). The type of dissipation function considered in our model leads to an elastic
region with Tresca-like branches and hence, in the ﬂow rule in rate-explicit dual form, we get
a case distinction to determine on which part of the yield surface the evolution takes place. In
this, there are therefore similarities to crystal plasticity in which each glide plane has its own
evolution and stresses are projected to the glide planes (see e.g.
[40]). In our model the non-
symmetric Eshelby-type stress ΣE driving the plastic evolution is projected on sl(3) ∩ Sym(3)
(symmetric and traceless tensors) for the plastic strain evolution and so(3) (skew-symmetric
tensors) for the plastic spin evolution.

Let us emphasize that, while we will present the complete and rigorous mathematical ex-
istence theory to our model, the main thrust in this work is not only of analytical nature. It
rather consists also in presenting that modeling framework for plastic spin which we deem to be
the most suited one.

This paper is now structured as follows. In Section 2, we present some notations and def-

4Unlike [41], no novel microforce balance needs to be introduced in our model. Also, in our theory, nonstandard
(tangential) boundary conditions for the plastic distortion p are always deﬁned at the external boundary of the
material only and the question on how to deﬁne them at a moving elastic-plastic boundary never arises. Any
speciﬁc prescription of such boundary conditions at the elastic-plastic boundary could be in contradiction with
the uniqueness result which we obtain for strong solutions.

initions. In Section 3, we introduce various aspects of the model, in particular, the ﬂow rule
in both primal and dual formulations with the key role played by the dissipation function. In
Sections 4 and 5, we study mathematical aspects (existence and uniqueness) of the model while
in Section 6, we recover the classical plasticity framework when the characteristic length scale
is set to be zero (Lc → 0).

Let Ω be a bounded domain in R3 with Lipschitz continuous boundary ∂Ω, which is occupied
by the elastoplastic body in its undeformed conﬁguration. Let Γ be a smooth subset of ∂Ω with
non-vanishing 2-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure. A material point in Ω is denoted by x and the
time domain under consideration is the interval [0, T ].

For isotropic media, the fourth order isotropic elasticity tensor Ciso : Sym(3) → Sym(3) is given
by

for any second-order tensor X, where µ and λ are the Lam´e moduli satisfying

and κ > 0 is the bulk modulus. These conditions suﬃce for pointwise positive deﬁniteness of

is such that (Curl X)T a = curl (X T a) for every a ∈ R3 and this clearly corresponds to the
transpose of the Curl of a tensor as deﬁned in [43, 46].

3.1. The balance equation

The conventional macroscopic force balance leads to the equation of equilibrium

div σ + f = 0

(3.1)

in which σ is the inﬁnitesimal symmetric Cauchy stress and f is the body force.

3.2. Constitutive equations.

The constitutive equations are obtained from a free energy imbalance together with a ﬂow
law that characterizes plastic behaviour. Since the model under study involves plastic spin by
which we mean that the plastic distortion p is not symmetric, we consider directly an additive

decomposition of the displacement gradient ∇u into elastic and plastic components e and p, so
that

∇u = e + p ,

with the nonsymmetric plastic distortion p incapable of sustaining volumetric changes; that is,

Here, εe = sym e = sym(∇u − p) is the inﬁnitesimal elastic strain and εp = sym p is the plastic
strain while sym∇u = (∇u + ∇uT )/2 is the total strain.

Here, Lc ≥ 0 is an energetic length scale which characterizes the contribution of the defect
energy density to the system, α1 and α2 are positive nondimensional isotropic hardening con-
stants, γp and ωp are isotropic hardening variables. The defect energy is conceptually related
to geometrically necessary dislocations (GND). It is formed by the long-ranging stress-ﬁelds of
excess dislocations and may be recovered by appropriate inelastic deformation. The isotropic
hardening energy is related to statistically stored dislocations (SSD).5 It is formed by the local
stress-ﬁelds of all dislocations and can only be recovered in thermodynamical processes such as
annealing, recrystallization or chemical reactions.

3.2.1. The derivation of the dissipation inequality

The local free-energy imbalance states that

˙Ψ − (cid:104)σ, ˙e(cid:105) − (cid:104)σ, ˙p(cid:105) ≤ 0 .

(3.6)

Now we expand the ﬁrst term, substitute (3.4) and get

(cid:104)Ciso sym e − σ, sym ˙e(cid:105) − (cid:104)σ, ˙p(cid:105) + µL2
5It is an easy matter to generalize the defect-energy contribution as well as the elasticity relation to the
complete anisotropic setting. However, this does not add anything to enhance understanding of the paper and
hence we leave these easy generalizations aside.

The split used in (3.13) is a constitutive choice in that it will suggest a suitable format on
how to satisfy the inequality (3.14) in all deformation processes. In our previously proposed
models (see [27]), this split has not been used.

3.2.2. The boundary conditions on the plastic distortion

The condition (3.12) is satisﬁed if we assume for instance that the boundary is a perfect conduc-
tor. This means that the tangential component of p vanishes on ∂Ω. In the context of dislocation
dynamics these conditions express the requirement that there is no ﬂux of the Burgers vector
across a hard boundary. Gurtin [41] and also Gurtin and Needleman [42] introduce the following
diﬀerent types of boundary conditions for the plastic distortion

∂tp × n|Γhard = 0 ”micro-hard” (perfect conductor)

∂tp|Γhard = 0 ”hard-slip”

Curl ∂tp × n|Γhard = 0 ”micro-free” .

(in the context of crytal plasticity)

(3.18)

We specify a suﬃcient condition for the micro-hard boundary condition, namely

p × n|Γhard = 0

(3.19)

and assume for simplicity only Γhard = ∂Ω = Γ. Note that this boundary condition constrains
the plastic slip in tangential direction only, which is what we expect to happen at the physical
boundary Γhard.

3.3. The ﬂow rule

Let D : R2 → R be the function deﬁned by

(cid:113)

0 s2 +(cid:98)σ2

σ2

0 t2 ,

D(s, t) :=

spin skew p, respectively.7

where σ0,(cid:98)σ0 > 0 are the initial yield stresses for symmetric strain sym p and skew-symmetric
interior. Therefore, we need σ0,(cid:98)σ0 > 0. Without isotropic hardening the elastic domain turns out to be
{ΣE ∈ R3×3 | (cid:107)dev sym ΣE(cid:107) ≤ σ0, (cid:107)skew ΣE(cid:107) ≤(cid:98)σ0}.

7Both values together will deﬁne the elastic domain in the stress space and this domain must have nonempty

(3.20)

12

We consider the dissipation function ∆ deﬁned by 8

∆(q, η, β) :=

D((cid:107)sym q(cid:107),(cid:107)skew q(cid:107))

otherwise .

(3.21)

0 s2 +(cid:98)σ2

σ2

0 t2

with r1, r2 ≥ 0 .

(3.22)

We could consider a more general dissipation function corresponding e.g. to the function

(cid:90)

Such a choice will not add any particular feature to the current model. In fact, as shown in
the appendix this simply corresponds to the expansion of the initial elastic domain (i.e. before
isotropic hardening takes place).

The ﬂow rule in its primal formulation can be derived using the principle of the minimum of the
dissipation function [48, 97, 19], stating that the rate of the internal variables is the minimizer
of a functional L consisting of the sum of the rate of the free energy and the dissipation function
with respect to appropriate boundary conditions,

L =

[ ˙Ψ + ∆]dx.

(3.23)

Ω

The principle of the minimum of the dissipation function is closely related to the principle
of maximum dissipation. Both are not physical principles but thermodynamically consistent
selection rules which turn out to be convenient if no other information is available or if existing
ﬂow rules are to be extended to a more general situation. For a detailed investigation, see [49].
A very general exposition for coupled physical processes is worked out in [53, 54]. Applications
to the evolution of plastic microstructures can be found in [50, 52, 51, 59].

Employing a partial integration, the stationarity conditions of (3.23) can be compactly stated
as

Σp ∈ ∂∆( ˙Γp)

and where ∂∆ denotes the subdiﬀerential of ∆. That is, for Σp ∈ ∂∆( ˙Γp) we must have

where Σp = (σ + Σlin

curl, g1, g2)

and

Γp = (p, γp, ωp) ,

∆(Γ) ≥ ∆( ˙Γp) + (cid:104)Σp, Γ − ˙Γp(cid:105)

≥ ∆( ˙Γp) + (cid:104)σ + Σlin
= ∆( ˙Γp) + (cid:104)ΣE, q − ˙p(cid:105) + g1 (η − ˙γp) + g2 (β − ˙ωp) ,

curl, q − ˙p(cid:105) + g1 (η − ˙γp) + g2 (β − ˙ωp)

(3.24)

(3.25)

for every Γ = (q, η, β). By choosing Γ = (0, 0, 0) in (3.25), we get the reduced dissipation
inequality in pointwise form

(cid:104)ΣE, ˙p(cid:105) + g1 ˙γp + g2 ˙ωp ≥ 0 ,

⇔ (cid:104)dev sym ΣE, sym ˙p(cid:105) + (cid:104)skew ΣE, skew ˙p(cid:105) + g1 ˙γp + g2 ˙ωp] ≥ 0

(3.26)

8Gurtin [41, p.2554] notes: ”One would expect that, plastically, the material response to spin diﬀers to
straining, and that straining and spin each incur dissipation.” Gurtin’s choice of the dissipation function in [41]

corresponds to (cid:98)σ0 = χ σ0 ≥ 0 in (3.20). Also, Gurtin [41, p.2558] takes χ → 0 formally and recovers classical
plasticity. If we want to take(cid:98)σ0 → 0 in our setting, then we encounter a problem described in Section 5.4.

3.3.2. The ﬂow law in its dual formulation

∀ Σ ∈ E ,

While the ﬂow rule in the primal formulation is extremely condensed and will allow us a mathe-
matical treatment (existence), we need the representation of the ﬂow rule in the dual formulation
in most computational implementations and for the uniqueness proof in Section 4.4. For this
formulation of the ﬂow rule we need to derive the set of admissible (generalized) stresses E
(the elastic domain) corresponding to the dissipation function ∆. According to the principle of
maximum dissipation,9 the ﬂow law in dual form is formulated in the context of convex analysis
as

˙Γp ∈ NE (Σp) ⇔ (cid:104) ˙Γp, Σ − Σp(cid:105) ≤ 0

(3.27)
where NE (Σp) is the normal cone to the set E of admissible stresses at Σp. Therefore, we need
to ﬁnd the set E. In the context of convex analysis, the indicator function IE of the set E is the
Fenchel-Legendre conjugate of the dissipation function ∆. Let us ﬁnd the set E whose interior
int(E) is the elastic domain and its boundary ∂E is the yield surface.
For Σp = (ΣE, g1, g2) with ΣE := σ + Σlin

IE (Σp) = sup(cid:8)(cid:104)Σp, Γ(cid:105) − ∆(Γ) | Γ = (q, η, β)(cid:9)

curl, we have

= sup(cid:8)(cid:104)ΣE, q(cid:105) + g1 η + g2 β − ∆(q, η, β) | (cid:107)sym q(cid:107) ≤ η , (cid:107)skew q(cid:107) ≤ β(cid:9)
(cid:8)(cid:104)ΣE, q(cid:105) + g1 η + g2 β − ∆(q, η, β) | (cid:107)sym q(cid:107) ≤ η , (cid:107)skew q(cid:107) ≤ β(cid:9)(cid:105)

Now taking the supremum with respect to q and using the fact that (cid:104)ΣE, q(cid:105) is maximum with
respect to q only when q is in the direction of ΣE, we ﬁnd that it is not restrictive to assume
that

sym q = s

Let us brieﬂy discuss the evolution of the yield surface. The hardening behavior will depend
on the values of the moduli α1, α2, and on the location of the generalized stress state (ΣE, g1, g2)

In this section, we present the full description of the model in the case α2 > 0 in the free-energy
Ψ in (3.4)-(3.5) as well as a corresponding existence result. The case α2 > 0 means that there
is always isotropic hardening in the spin-evolution equation. We recall that the dissipation

function ∆ is given in (3.21) and the yield function in the case σ0 > 0 and (cid:98)σ0 > 0 (see (3.39))

4.1. The strong formulation

The strong formulation of the model consists in ﬁnding:

(i) the displacement u ∈ H1(0, T ; H1
(ii) the inﬁnitesimal plastic distortion p ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω, sl(3))) with

0(Ω, Γ, R3)),

Curl p ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω, R3×3))

and

Curl Curl p ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω, R3×3)) ,

(iii) the internal isotropic hardening variables γp, ωp ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω))

such that the content of Table 2 holds.

4.2. The weak formulation
Assume that the problem in Section 4.1 has a solution (u, p, γp, ωp). Let v ∈ H 1(Ω, R3) with
v|ΓD = 0. Multiply the equilibrium equation with v − ˙u and integrate in space by parts and use

Table 2: The model with isotropic hardening and plastic spin: the case α2 > 0. Because of the control of
the L2-norm of both isotropic hardening variables η and β and the constraints (cid:107)sym q(cid:107) ≤ η and (cid:107)skew q(cid:107) ≤ β,
the function space for the non-symmetric plastic distortion p is easily seen to be H(Curl; Ω, R3×3). Note that
the dual formulation of the ﬂow rule needs a case distinction depending on the branches Si of the yield surface
while the primal formulation does not need it. Clearly, isotropic hardening for the plastic strain depends only
on the accumulated equivalent plastic strain and isotropic hardening for the plastic rotation depends only on the
accumulated equivalent plastic rotation. Therefore, there is no spin cross-hardening. In this ﬂow rule in dual
form we appreciate a Tresca like behaviour (see [56]) in that we have to use a case distinction to determine on
which part of the yield surface the evolution takes place.

4.3. Existence result for the weak formulation

To prove the existence result for the weak formulation (4.4), we closely follow the abstract
machinery developed by Han and Reddy in [55] for mathematical problems in geometrically
linear classical plasticity and used for instance in [24, 103, 83, 27, 28] for models of gradient
plasticity. To this aim, (4.4) is written as the variational inequality of the second kind: ﬁnd
w = (u, p, γp, ωp) ∈ H1(0, T ; Z) such that w(0) = 0,

˙w(t) ∈ W for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ] and
a( ˙w, z − w) + j0(z) − j0( ˙w) ≥ (cid:104)(cid:96), z − ˙w(cid:105) for every z ∈ W and for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ] ,

functionals a, j0 and (cid:96) satisfy the assumptions in the abstract result in [55, Theorem 7.3]. The
key issue here is the coercivity of the bilinear form a on the set W.

We let

0(Ω, ΓD, R3) = {v ∈ H1(Ω, R3)| v|ΓD

= 0} ,

V = H1
Q = H0(Curl; Ω, Γ, sl(3)) ,
Λ = L2(Ω) ,
Z = V × Q × Λ2 ,

W = (cid:8)z = (v, q, η, β) ∈ Z | (cid:107)sym q(cid:107) ≤ η and (cid:107)skew q(cid:107) ≤ β(cid:9) ,

This shows existence for the model with α2 > 0 (and α1 > 0).

4.4. Uniqueness of the strong solution

If in the geometrically linear classical plasticity model with isotropic hardening, the unique-
ness of the weak solution is obtained from the formulation in a variational inequality (see [55,
Theorem 7.3]) the uniqueness of the weak solution in the context of gradient plasticity with

Canonical gradient plasticity with plastic spin

21

isotropic hardening has not yet been completely established. However, in some particular cases,
the uniqueness has been obtained provided weak solutions are regular enough (see e.g.
[55,
pp.210-212]). For Prager-type linear kinematical hardening, the uniqueness of strong solutions
in inﬁnitesimal perfect gradient plasticity was established in [81]. In our context, we will prove
that requiring Curl Curl p ∈ L2(Ω, R3×3) is enough to guarantee the uniqueness of the strong
solution.
In fact, we ﬁrst notice that if Γp = (u, p, γp, ωp) ∈ W is a solution of (4.4) with Curl Curl p ∈
L2(Ω, R3×3), then choosing appropriately test functions and integrating by parts, we easily get
that Γp = (u, p, γp, ωp) satisﬁes the equilibrium equation (3.1) on the one hand and the ﬂow rule
in dual form

(cid:104) ˙Γp, Σ − Σp(cid:105) ≤ 0

∀ Σ

(4.13)

on the other hand.

Let us now consider two solutions Γpi = (ui, pi, γp i, ωp i),

i = 1, 2 of (4.4) satisfying the

same initial conditions and let Σp i = (ΣE i, g1 i, g2 i) be the corresponding stresses. That is,

ΣE i = σi − µ L2

c Curl Curl pi ,

g1 i = −µ α1γp i ,

g2 i = −µ α2 ωp i .

Hence, Γp i and Σp i satisfy (4.13), that is,

(cid:104) ˙Γp1, Σ − Σp 1(cid:105) ≤ 0

and (cid:104) ˙Γp2, Σ − Σp 2(cid:105) ≤ 0

∀ Σ

Now choose Σ = Σp 2 in (4.15)1 and Σ = Σp 1 in (4.15)2 and add up to get

(cid:104)Σp 2 − Σp 1, ˙Γp 1 − ˙Γp 2(cid:105) ≤ 0 .

That is

(cid:104)σ2 − σ1, ˙p1 − ˙p2(cid:105) + µ L2

c(cid:104)Curl Curl (p2 − p1), ˙p2 − ˙p1(cid:105)

+ µ α1 (γp 2 − γp 1)( ˙γp 2 − ˙γp 1) + µ α2 (ωp 2 − ωp 1)( ˙ωp 2 − ˙ωp 1) ≤ 0 .

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

Since σ is symmetric, the latter is equivalent to

(cid:104)σ2 − σ1, sym( ˙p1 − ˙p2)(cid:105) + µ L2

c(cid:104)Curl Curl (p2 − p1), ˙p2 − ˙p1(cid:105)

+ µ α1 (γp 2 − γp 1)( ˙γp 2 − ˙γp 1) + µ α2 (ωp 2 − ωp 1)( ˙ωp 2 − ˙ωp 1) ≤ 0 .

(4.18)
Now, substitute sym pi = sym(∇ui)− C−1σi obtained from the elasticity relation, into equation
(4.18) and get
(cid:104)σ2 − σ1, C−1( ˙σ2 − ˙σ1)(cid:105) + µ L2

c(cid:104)Curl Curl (p2 − p1), ˙p2 − ˙p1(cid:105) + µ α1 (γp 2 − γp 1)( ˙γp 2 − ˙γp 1)

+ µ α2 (ωp 2 − ωp 1)( ˙ωp 2 − ˙ωp 1) ≤ (cid:104)σ1 − σ2, sym(∇ ˙u1) − sym(∇ ˙u2)(cid:105) .

(4.19)

Now, notice that from the equilibrium equation we get

(cid:104)σ1 − σ2, sym(∇ ˙u1) − sym(∇ ˙u2)(cid:105) dx = 0 .

(cid:90)

Ω

22

Therefore, we obtain

2 + µ α2 (cid:107)ωp 2 − ωp 1(cid:107)2

2 = 0 ,

(4.21)

from which we get σ1 = σ2, Curl p1 = Curl p2, γp 1 = γp 2, ωp 2 = ωp 1 and hence, ΣE 1 = ΣE 2.
Now, let us prove that p1 = p2. In fact, from the deﬁnition of the normal cone it follows that
˙pi = 0 and ˙γp i = ˙ωp i = 0 inside the elastic domain E, which from the initial conditions imply
that pi = 0 inside E. Now, looking at the ﬂow rule in dual form in Table 2, we easily obtain that
˙p1 = ˙p2 which implies
sym ˙p1 = sym ˙p2 and skew ˙p1 = skew ˙p2 on each surface Sk. Therefore,
that p1 = p2 from the initial conditions.
In order to show that u1 = u2, we use sym(∇ui) = C−1σi+sym pi obtained from the elasticity

relation and get

sym(∇(u1 − u2)) = C−1(σ1 − σ2) + sym(p1 − p2) = 0 ,

and hence, from the ﬁrst Korn’s inequality (see e.g. [79]), we get ∇(u1 − u2) = 0 which implies
that u1 = u2. Therefore, we ﬁnally obtain

u1 = u2 ,

σ1 = σ2 ,

p1 = p2 ,

γp 1 = γp 2 ,

ωp 1 = ωp 2 ,

and thus the uniqueness of a strong solution to the mathematical problem describing our model
of rate-independent geometrically linear gradient plasticity with isotropic hardening and plastic
spin in the case α2 > 0, where there is always isotropic hardening in the spin-evolution equation.

4.5. Perfect gradient plasticity with spin

Inspection of the uniqueness proof for strong solutions in Section 4.4 shows that in the case
with zero isotropic plastic strain and spin hardening, and the homogeneous boundary conditions
u|Γ = 0 and p × n|Γ = 0, elastic stresses σ, elastic strains εe = sym e and furthermore elastic
distortions e = ∇u− p are unique. The uniqueness with respect to elastic distortions uses again
the new Korn’s inequality for incompatible tensor ﬁelds [89] since e × n|Γ = 0. In this case, the
extra inclusion of the spin and the dislocation density tensor allow to improve uniqueness from
elastic strains to elastic distortions.

5. The complete mathematical formulation in the no-spin-hardening case

Here we set α2 = 0 in the free-energy Ψ in (3.4)-(3.5). The case α2 = 0 means that there is no
isotropic hardening in the spin-evolution. At present we believe that it is this case which deserves

Canonical gradient plasticity with plastic spin

23

special attention, since in this model we extend classical plasticity in the weakest possible way
to depend on plastic spin. Notably, we do not incur additional spin-hardening. The dissipation
function ∆ is still the same given in (3.21) and the yield function is given in (4.1). Also,
in this model the inﬂuence of the SSD’s and GND’s on plastic ﬂow is neatly separated: the
SSD-distribution inﬂuences only isotropic hardening through the classical mechanism and the
GND-distribution determines the nonlocal kinematic hardening.

5.1. The strong formulation

The strong formulation of the model in this case consists in ﬁnding:

(i) the displacement u ∈ H1(0, T ; H1
(ii) the inﬁnitesimal plastic distortion p such that sym p ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω, sl(3))) with

0(Ω, Γ, R3)),

Curl p ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω, R3×3))

and

Curl Curl p ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω, R3×3)) ,

(iii) the internal isotropic hardening variable γp ∈ H1(0, T ; L2(Ω))

such that the content of Table 3 holds.

5.2. The weak formulation of the model

The weak formulation of the equilibrium equation (3.1) still holds in the case α2 = 0, that is,

(cid:104)Ciso sym(∇u − p), sym(∇v − ∇ ˙u)(cid:105) dx =

Ω

Ω

f (v − ˙u) dx

∀v ∈ H 1

the boundary conditions on p necessitates at least p ∈ H(Curl ; Ω, R3×3), which is not guaranteed looking at the
free-energy and the dissipation function. However, this will be obtained from a new Korn’s type inequality for
incompatible tensor ﬁelds derived by Neﬀ et al. in [86, 87, 88, 89] .

5.3. Existence result in the no-spin-hardening case

As in Section 4.3, we write (5.3) as the variational inequality of the second kind: ﬁnd
w = (u, p, γp, ωp) ∈ H1(0, T ; Z) such that w(0) = 0 and ˙w(t) ∈ W for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ]
a( ˙w, z − w) + j(z) − j( ˙w) ≥ (cid:104)(cid:96), z − ˙w(cid:105) for every z ∈ Z and for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ] ,

Similarly to Section 4.3, the main challenge here is to construct the space Z and the subset W
such that the bilinear form a is coercive in W.

First of all, notice that since the bilinear form a does not contain explicitly the variable β, it
is impossible to derive the coercivity of the bilinear form in any normed space in all the variables
v, q, η and β. Therefore, the new solution strategy here for the existence result is to ﬁrst ﬁnd
u, p and γp, and construct ωp a posteriori. To this end, we deﬁne

∆0(q, η) :=

where we recall that

˙w(t) ∈ W for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ]
a( ˙w, z−w)+j0(z)−j0( ˙w) ≥ (cid:104)(cid:96), z− ˙w(cid:105) for every z = (v, q, η) ∈ W and for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ] , (5.10)

Now, for the existence of a solution to the problem (5.10) following Hahn-Reddy [55, Theorem
7.3], we only need to check that the bilinear form a is coercive in W. Following the coercivity
inequality in (4.12), we immediately get a positive constant C = C(m0, µ, α1, Lc, Ω) > 0 such
that

a(z, z) ≥ C(cid:2)(cid:107)v(cid:107)2

2 + (cid:107)η(cid:107)2

(cid:3) .

But this estimate is not enough to establish coercivity. Indeed, the skew-symmetric (spin) part
skew q of q is not controlled locally.

Motivated by the well-posedness question for precursors to this model [83, 27], Neﬀ et al. [86,
87, 88, 89], derived a new inequality extending Korn’s ﬁrst inequality to incompatible tensor
ﬁelds, namely there exists a constant C(Ω) > 0 such that

∀ p ∈ H(Curl ; Ω, R3×3), p × n|Γ = 0 :

(5.15)

.

This shows that if we consider the closure Hsym (Curl , Ω, Γ; sl(3)) of the linear subspace

{q ∈ C∞(Ω, R3×3) | tr q = 0, q × n = 0 on Γ}

in the norm

(cid:107)q(cid:107)2

sym, curl := (cid:107)sym q(cid:107)2

L2 + (cid:107)Curl q(cid:107)2

L2 ,

(5.16)

then we have the decisive identity

Hsym (Curl , Ω, Γ; sl(3)) ≡ H0(Curl , Ω, Γ; sl(3))

with equivalence of norms. Therefore, we have the coercivity inequality

a(z, z) ≥ C(cid:2)(cid:107)v(cid:107)2

(cid:3) = (cid:107)z(cid:107)2

∀z ∈ W ,

(5.17)
from which we obtain the existence of a solution (u, p, γp) ∈ W to the problem (5.10). Now
setting a posteriori

Z

ωp(t, x) :=

(cid:107)skew ˙p(s, x)(cid:107) ds ,

(5.18)

it follows that (u, p, γp, ωp) is a solution to the original problem (5.4).

Remark 5.1 Notice again that isotropic hardening in the spin-evolution is not necessary for
existence of a solution to the problem and it is not connected to the uniqueness question either.
In fact, arguing as in Section 4.4 we get the inequality (4.21) with α2 = 0, from which and
from the ﬂow law in dual form on each Sk of the yield surface, we deduce the uniqueness of
u, σ, p and γp while the uniqueness of ωp follows from (5.18) and from the uniqueness of p.
Therefore, the strong solution is unique also in the case where there is no isotropic hardening in
the spin-evolution.

5.4. Is it possible to accommodate the special case (cid:98)σ0 = 0 in our model?
In Gurtin’s visco-plastic model [41] it is possible to consider (cid:98)σ0 = 0. In our setting, this case

corresponds to the dissipation function

fact, since g2 may be zero initially, the elastic domain E in (5.20) may not have non-empty

Table 4 illustrates why both initial yield stresses σ0 and (cid:98)σ0 have to be strictly positive. In
interior. Therefore, this forbids the use of (cid:98)σ0 = 0. In the visco-plastic setting (cid:98)σ0 = 0 may be
accommodated.
6. The limit case of vanishing characteristic length scale Lc → 0
In the limit case Lc → 0, looking at the ﬂow rule in its dual formulation, we ﬁrst observe that
the thermodynamic driving stress ΣE ∈ R3×3 reduces to the symmetric Cauchy stress tensor
σ ∈ Sym(3) and we see clearly that we do not have the branch S2 and moreover,

(6.2)

Therefore, we obtain for Lc → 0 that all driving stress-tensor quantities are symmetric such
that, if p(0) ∈ Sym(3), then we will have p(t) ∈ Sym(3) along the plastic evolution. In that
case, our new model turns into

˙γp =(cid:98)λ = (cid:107)˙εp(cid:107) ,
based only on the accumulated equivalent plastic strain γp =(cid:82) t

which is the dual formulation of the ﬂow rule for classical plasticity with isotropic hardening

For us it is interesting to remark that the evolution of plastic spin in our model is related solely
to the energetic length scale Lc > 0.

(6.3)

7. Conclusions and outlook

¿From a modelling perspective, it is not diﬃcult to extend the present model to visco-plasticity.
However, the well-posedness result (which we expect to hold) needs to be derived along diﬀerent
methods. Moreover, it would be interesting to treat the dynamic case. Both questions are
subject of ongoing work.

Canonical gradient plasticity with plastic spin

29

Since we did not establish unqualiﬁed uniqueness in our model (it hinges on the additional
regularity Curl Curl p ∈ L2(Ω, R3×3)) it will also be interesting to establish higher regularity
provided the data are regular. It remains open whether we really could have non-uniqueness
of the weak solutions if regularity is missing. Is the dislocation energy contribution Curl p ∈
L2(Ω, R3×3) strong enough to prevent non-uniqueness? The question we have to answer is, what
least amount of hardening will lead to existence and uniqueness in rate-independent gradient
plasticity?
We expect furthermore that a computational implementation suggests itself along the lines of
[90]. Attendant to these research perspectives, one should look at simple settings of boundary
value problems like anti-plane shear to gain more insight in the response of the model and the
new features oﬀered by incorporating plastic spin.
Finally, a major challenge from the mathematical point of view is the replacement of the
defect energy in (3.5)2 by a more physically realistic term µ Lc(cid:107)Curl p(cid:107). Such a defect energy
was proposed in [96] in the context of single crystal gradient plasticity and is summarized in [55,
p.92]. The successful mathematical treatment of such a model needs fundamentally new ideas.
