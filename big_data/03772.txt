Tadpole-Induced Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and pNGB Higgs Models

We investigate induced electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in models in which the Higgs is
a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). In pNGB Higgs models, Higgs properties and precision
electroweak measurements imply a hierarchy between the EWSB and global symmetry-breaking
scales, vH (cid:28) fH . When the pNGB potential is generated radiatively, this hierarchy requires ﬁne-
tuning to a degree of at least ∼ v2
H . We show that if Higgs EWSB is induced by a tadpole arising
from an auxiliary sector at scale fΣ (cid:28) vH , this tuning is signiﬁcantly ameliorated or can even be
removed. We present explicit examples both in Twin Higgs models and in Composite Higgs models
based on SO(5)/SO(4). For the Twin case, the result is a fully natural model with fH ∼ 1 TeV
and the lightest colored top partners at 2 TeV. These models also have an appealing mechanism
to generate the scales of the auxiliary sector and Higgs EWSB directly from the scale fH , with a
natural hierarchy fΣ (cid:28) vH (cid:28) fH ∼ TeV. The framework predicts modiﬁed Higgs coupling as well
as new Higgs and vector states at LHC13.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of the Higgs boson has sharpened the

problem of the naturalness of the electroweak (EW)

ﬁciently light, the physical Higgs mass mh = 125 GeV
can be obtained naturally without any tuning. Direct
experimental limits on the scale m∗ of top partners [12–
14] give lower bounds on the tuning of such theories, but

scale. An attractive solution is that the Higgs boson

current bounds can allow a totally natural mass scale for

the Higgs when colored top partner decays are hidden

of a global symmetry that is spontaneously broken at

[15, 16] or the global symmetry is partially restored by

a scale fH not far above the electroweak scale vH =
246 GeV [1, 2]. More modern realizations of this idea

include Composite Higgs (CH) models (with partial com-

positeness) [3–5], as well as Twin Higgs (TH) [6, 7] and

Little Higgs [8–11].

Standard Model (SM) interactions must explicitly

break the global symmetries protecting the pNGB Higgs.

This results in radiative contributions to the pNGB

potential, with the largest contributions from the top

Yukawa coupling and the gauging of SU (2)L. These
contributions connect the mass scales of new top and

gauge partners restoring the global symmetries to the

mass scale of the Higgs boson, and in minimal composite

Higgs models the pNGB potential is entirely generated

by these contributions. For instance, the contributions

from the top sector perturb the vev and physical Higgs

mass proportionally by an amount of size

where m∗ is the mass scale of the top partners which
restore the global symmetry. If these resonances are suf-

neutral particles, as in Twin Higgs models [6, 7].

However, observations of Higgs properties [17–19] re-
quire vH (cid:28) fH so that the curvature of the pNGB mani-
fold does not induce signiﬁcant Higgs coupling deviations

from the SM values (see, e.g., [20, 21]). SM-like Higgs

measurements at the level of ∼ 10% constrain f 2
H ∼> 10,
and future measurements will reach the ∼ 1% level [22–
24]. This makes realizing a natural model much more dif-

ﬁcult. Minimal versions of 3rd generation partners can
only obtain mh = 125 GeV when vH (cid:28) fH with se-
vere radiative tuning [20, 21]. More elaborate/extended

fermionic sectors can improve the situation, but the

structure of radiative contributions to the pNGB poten-

tial still leads to an ‘irreducible’ tuning ∆∼> f 2

.

These obstacles motivate studying pNGB Higgs mod-

els with a combination of additional tree-level contri-

butions to the potential and top sectors that minimize

radiative contributions, as such models stand the best

chance to be ‘maximally natural.’ One well-known strat-

egy, used in Little Higgs (as well as some TH models [25]),

is to introduce additional dynamics generating a tree-

for weakly-coupled UV completions). The ability of

level quartic without a signiﬁcant contribution to the

tadpole-induced EWSB to improve naturalness diﬀers

Higgs mass-squared parameter. The quartic is the dom-

for the two frameworks:

2

inant term in the potential, stabilizing the vacuum at

vH = 0, and the radiative potential, which generates a
negative mass-squared parameter, is a small perturbation

moving the vacuum to a non-zero vev with a natural hi-
erarchy vH (cid:28) fH .

Here, we study an alternative approach. The pNGB

potential will naturally be of the size of the radiative

contributions, but with a positive mass-squared stabi-

lizing the vacuum at vH = 0. An auxiliary decou-
pling EWSB sector Σ is then introduced to trigger Higgs

EWSB through a linear coupling to the Higgs sector, per-

turbing the Higgs vacuum to a non-zero vev with a nat-
ural hierarchy fΣ (cid:28) vH (cid:28) fH (where the total scale of
EWSB is v2 = f 2
H ). This is an application of Bosonic
Technicolor (BTC) or, as it is more recently dubbed, in-

Σ+v2

duced EWSB [26–40] to a pNGB Higgs. A schematic

comparison of this approach to the tuned minimal radia-

tive approach is shown in Fig. 1.

The tuning problem in pNGB models in many ways

resembles the little hierarchy problem of the minimal su-

persymmetric standard model (MSSM), where obtaining
mh = 125 GeV radiatively requires stop masses m˜t (cid:29)
TeV and/or large A-terms, both of which directly con-

tribute to the tuning [41].

It is not surprising then

that parallels can be drawn between proposed solutions

in the two frameworks. For example, the addition of

radiatively-safe tree-level quartics is commonplace both

in supersymmetric models (as in, e.g., the NMSSM) [42–

45] and in Little Higgs.

Indeed, the approach we take

here to reconciling the Higgs mass with naturalness has

been considered previously in the context of supersym-

metric models [27, 28, 36–40], but has not yet been em-

ployed in composite/pNGB Higgs models.

SO(5)/SO(4) MCHM:

For

SO(5)/SO(4) models,

tadpole-induced EWSB can easily allow mh = 125 GeV.
This makes models with minimal breaking of the global

symmetry and minimal representations of

fermionic

third generation partners (MCHM5+1) viable. These

models normally fail to generate a suﬃciently heavy

Higgs without excessive tuning. However, the tuning
in these models still remains larger than f 2

from the top sector, and so the tadpole mechanism does

not necessarily improve naturalness compared to models

that obtain mh = 125 GeV via radiative contributions
from an extended top sector (e.g., MCHM14+1 with

very light top partners) or large τR compositeness. So
tadpole-induced EWSB resuscitates some (in particular,

simple) composite Higgs models, but does not necessar-

ily improve upon more complicated, minimally-tuned

models.

Twin Higgs Models: For Composite Twin Higgs models,

radiative contributions from the top sector can be

signiﬁcantly smaller, and so the tadpole-induced EWSB

structure allows the tuning to be substantially improved

these models in the presence of a non-dynamical tadpole

term. In Sec. III, we give concrete examples of top sectors

II. PNGB MODELS WITH TADPOLES

In Composite Higgs models, the SM Higgs is identiﬁed

with a pNGB in the coset G/H of the spontaneously-
broken global symmetry G → H. We discuss how the
presence of a tadpole term modiﬁes the structure of the
pNGB potential, naturally allowing vH (cid:28) fH with radia-
tive contributions setting the scale for mh = 125 GeV.

A key point is that radiative contributions to the po-

vH (cid:28) fH requires |α| (cid:28) β, and in the case of a purely ra-

This mechanism requires α > 0, such that vH = 0 for γ =
0. The tadpole perturbs the vacuum from vH = 0 and a
small value of γ naturally leads to vH (cid:28) fH . As such,
the correct Higgs mass and vev can be achieved even with
β (cid:28) βSM. Moreover, since γ explicitly breaks SU (2)L,
a hierarchy γ (cid:28) α is naturally preserved by radiative
corrections. As long as radiative contributions to the
mass-squared can be made naturally small, δαf 2

the overall naturalness of the model can be improved.

B. Twin Higgs Models

Twin Higgs models extend the coset and low-energy

content of the theory to preserve a spontaneously broken
Z2 mirror symmetry by introducing new mirror top and
gauge partners at the scale vB ∼ fH . The restored Z2

symmetry is suﬃcient to cut oﬀ the quadratic sensitivity

of the pNGB potential at the scale fH instead of the scale
of the colored top partners, which are somewhat heavier.

The original twin Higgs model [6, 7] consisted of an

SU (4)-invariant potential

that quadratically-divergent radiative contributions take

the form Λ2(cid:16)

|HA|2 + |HB|2(cid:17)

, which is independent of

the light Higgs ﬁeld.

The analysis of the preceding section establishes that
a tadpole can decouple the hierarchy vH (cid:28) fH from the
parameters in the Higgs sector, and hence from the scale

of radiative corrections to those parameters. At very

least, this allows the correct Higgs vev and mass to be

Just as before, the tadpole allows the vev to be continu-

ously perturbed away from the vH = 0 vacuum, giving a
hierarchy vH (cid:28) fH without any tuning.

It is interesting to note that, while the enlarged struc-
ture of the Twin Higgs due to the Z2 symmetry per-
mits multiple possibilities for the unperturbed vacuum
(i.e., with κ2 = 0), this reduced tuning is unique to the
model perturbing around (|HA| ,|HB|) =
with
Z2-symmetric tadpoles. In principal, spontaneous or ex-
plicit Z2 breaking in the Σ sector could give a tadpole
only in the A-sector, (fΣA , fΣB ) =
. But, in this
case, the vacuum with vH (cid:28) fH reached by perturb-
ing about (|HA| ,|HB|) =
is always unstable to
a global vacuum at vH = fH reached from the unper-
turbed (|HA| ,|HB|) =
vacuum. Moreoever, this
is true even in the presence of higher-order terms that

sidered a similar model with the unperturbed vacuum
instead at (|HA| ,|HB|) =
and a spontaneous
Z2 breaking in the tadpole sector, (fΣA , fΣB ) = (0, fΣ).
The tadpole helps favor (cid:104)|HA|(cid:105) < (cid:104)|HB|(cid:105), but obtaining
a hierarchy vH (cid:28) fH is still a large perturbation away
from the unperturbed vacuum, requiring a tuning of the

Thus vH (cid:28) fH can be obtained naturally in the Twin

achieved without the requirement of generating a suﬃ-
ciently large β (cid:29) |α|. Moreover, as radiative contribu-

tuning ∆∼> f 2

, induced EWSB permits the possibility

of a more natural model than the minimal radiative mod-

els. However, for tuning to be signiﬁcantly improved, it

is necessary that radiative contributions can be reduced

relative to those of the minimal radiative models. To

identify cases in which this can occur, we will now discuss

more concretely the form of the top sector and the size

of radiative corrections for both minimal SO(5)/SO(4)

Composite (MCHM5+1) and Twin Higgs models.

An important constraint comes from realizing the top

Yukawa coupling, which in Composite Higgs models gives

a rough lower limit on the top partner masses compared

that, in a Twin Higgs model, this is the mass of the SM

By comparison, the ‘irreducible’ tuning Eq. (5) resulted

from the minimal size of radiative corrections necessary

potential to substantially reduce this tuning, particularly

if the size of the top sector radiative contributions can be

reduced as much as Eq. (17) na¨ıvely suggests.

cannot be made lighter than ∼ 2fH , the tuning is still
dominated by the radiative top sector tuning even with

This possibility is especially pertinent in light of recent

an additional tadpole contribution. As such, the over-

LHC results. Current constraints on Higgs properties re-

quire fH ∼> 750 GeV. Without extra tree-level contribu-

tions to the Higgs potential, this would imply that the

tuning of an extended radiative po-

minimal radiative models are tuned at the level of at least
O(20%), indicating a tension with the principle of natu-
ralness. In contrast, constraints on colored top partners

are m∗ ∼> 700 GeV, and are signiﬁcantly weaker for the
uncolored partners in TH. For such values of fH and m∗,
the radiative tuning can be still O(1), corresponding to
an essentially untuned model.

In the partial compositeness framework, the mixings

of the elementary and composite fermions generate the

This in turn leads to more tuning. A model exhibiting

top partners with masses ∼> fH and a tadpole contribu-

tion to the potential can be signiﬁcant more natural (with
tuning reduced by O(5 − 10)) than the MCHM5+1 with

non-minimal radiative contributions giving β = βSM with

tuning. For example, the ‘maximally natural’ top sec-

tor of the MCHM5+1 model can be supplemented by

additional radiative contributions to the potential with
|δα| (cid:39) |δβ| from large τR compositeness.3 Another
possibility is an extended top sector, for example the
MCHM14+1 model gives |α| ∼ |β| and may be able to
radiatively realize β = βSM in the region of parameter
space with m∗ ∼ fH . Therefore, in SO(5)/SO(4) mod-
els, other equally natural realizations may exist. But,

the tadpole mechanism is attractive for preserving the

minimal partial compositeness partner realization.

UV COMPLETIONS

Refs. [46, 47] studied pNGB Twin Higgs models based

on an SO(8)/SO(7) coset with a partially composite top

sector, similar to those studied in the MCHM [5, 20, 21]

and above. In particular we focus on the model studied in

So far, we have considered a tadpole that arises due

to an unspeciﬁed auxiliary sector exhibiting an SU (2)L-
breaking vev fΣ. However, the dynamics of the auxiliary

sector are also relevant. For instance, the auxiliary sector

experiences back-reaction from the non-zero Higgs vev,

and it is important to ensure that this does not destabi-

lize the auxiliary sector or lead to hidden tuning. Mean-

while, any explicit G-breaking present in the auxiliary

sector may be communicated to the Higgs sector.

The presence of an additional sector containing an elec-

troweak doublet also leads to modiﬁcations of Higgs prop-

erties and novel states that may be produced at colliders.

Notably, a second doublet gives rise to additional charged
and pseudoscalar Higgses, H± and A respectively, sim-
ilar to those of a fermiophobic/type-I two Higgs dou-

blet model (in which only a single doublet couples to

fermions). Thus, the largely SM-like nature of the Higgs

and the non-observation of BSM states at the LHC con-

strains the dynamics of the auxiliary sector. Overall, the

the Higgs and Σ sectors we expect in this scenario. While

these operators may have interesting implications, the

qualitative features of the model remain unchanged. Fi-

An eﬀective theory analysis has previously been car-

EWSB with a single Higgs doublet coupled to a linearly-

realized Σ doublet in [39]. They conﬁrmed that it was

possible to achieve a stable vacuum with fΣ < vH and,
as the tadpole limit is approached, tuning does indeed

become small. Here, we extend this analysis to the case

of the MCHM and Twin Higgs scenarios. While the re-

quirement of strong coupling limits the validity of a linear

description of the auxiliary sector, this approach allows

us to investigate the back-reaction, tuning and impact

of Σ-sector G-breaking described above, as well as the

form of the tadpoles generated. We will discuss in more

So, the EWSB vev in the Σ sector does receive a correc-

eﬀect is suppressed in the strong coupling regime when
δΣ is large.5 In particular, that the shift in (cid:104)Σ(cid:105) is rel-

does not result in additional tuning.

In the strong-coupling limit, this eﬀect is of similar size

to the experimentally-required value of α, and therefore

does not induce additional tuning. Higher-order terms

are suppressed by powers of mixing between the Higgs

and Σ sector, but can be relevant for the phenomenology

of the extra Higgs states, as will be discussed in Sec. IV B.

This analysis indicates that the dynamics of the aux-

iliary sector do not disrupt the leading-order description

of a Higgs pNGB with positive mass term (α > 0) and

EWSB induced by a tadpole as in Sec. II, particularly in

the strong-coupling limit required by experimental con-

where we have elided terms proportional to λΣ that do

straints. Back-reaction and explicit SO(5)-breaking lead
to at most O(1) shifts to (fΣ, α), and so for strong-
coupling induce no additional tuning in either sector.

2. Twin Higgs

The Twin Higgs case is similar to the SO(5)/SO(4)

scenario described above except with one important dif-
ference, namely that the Z2 requires that both of the
scales in the H sector, including vB ∼ fH (cid:29) vH , couple
to the auxiliary sector. This causes a larger perturbation

in the Σ sector, although such perturbations can still be

suﬃciently small to avoid tuning or destabilization of the

not couple the ΣA and ΣB sectors. The B-sector vev is
shifted by

particular, as fΣB is unconstrained by experiment, it can
be somewhat larger than fΣA , such that contributions to
the Higgs mass can be somewhat enhanced. This indi-

sector may be the source of the required α > 0.

The back-reaction and mixing contributions remain

comparable to the required fΣ and α. So, while they

make a complete analysis of the potential somewhat more

complicated, they do not induce additional tuning. We

have conﬁrmed this is the case with a full numerical study

of the potential. Overall, our results are consistent with
those of [39]; it is possible to achieve O(1) tuning and

symmetry (i.e., δΣ∼> λΣ), and strong coupling.

So far, we have ignored the role of λΣ. Treating λΣ as

a perturbation, a shift in the ΣA vev is also generated
at leading order as a result of (cid:104)σB(cid:105), (cid:104)σA(cid:105) = λΣ
2δΣ (cid:104)σB(cid:105).
Clearly, for a more generic potential with λΣ ∼ δΣ, both
ΣA and ΣB can experience large perturbations due to the
fH tadpole. This raises the interesting possibility that
the hierarchy and coincidence of scales is generated by

a “waterfall” of induced breakings originating from fH .
For instance, in the limit that ΛΣ = 0, the scale of the

Σ sector is set completely by the large B-sector tadpole

from fH . While ΛΣ = 0 is unnatural in the linear sigma
model, this serves as a useful toy model for a strongly-

coupled model where the scale of a conformal Σ sector

may be triggered by the coupling to the H sector, as we
will discuss shortly. Then δ3/2

generating the Higgs and Σ sector scales. However, be-

cause the Σ sector must be near strong coupling and its

interactions with the Higgs sector can be a strong per-

turbation, there may be important higher-order eﬀects

neglected in this description. In the following section, we

give an eﬀective description of strongly-coupled UV com-

pletions and argue that the qualitative features remain

the same.

B. Strongly-Coupled Auxiliary Sectors

We now focus on the case that H and Σ emerge from

independent strongly-coupled sectors with compositeness

scales ΛΣ < ΛH .

1. Composite Higgs — SO(5)/SO(4)

The global symmetries of the two sectors are SO(5)H
and SO(4)Σ. At scales above ΛH , the two sectors
are weakly coupled by an operator explicitly breaking

obtaining a mass from the explicit breaking.

When Oκ2 is a suﬃciently weak perturbation on both
the Σ and H sectors, the leading eﬀect in the IR at scales
below ΛH is to generate the tadpole term κ2H · Σ in the
pNGB potential. In the parameter space of interest Oκ2
will always be a weak perturbation on the fundamental

H sector at ΛH , but it may not be a weak perturbation
on the Σ sector; by NDA [55–57] Oκ2 can be a strong
perturbation on the Σ sector if κ2vH ∼> Λ2
ΣfΣ, as for the

linear sigma model above.

The eﬀects on the pNGB Higgs potential are deter-

mined by treating H as a background ﬁeld and integrat-

ing out the Σ sector at ΛΣ to obtain the full Goldstone

in the masses of the extra Higgs sector states ΠA. For
example, the tadpole and ﬁrst leading contribution to the

For ΛΣ (cid:39) 4πfΣ, back-reaction and higher-order terms
result in ∼< O(1) shifts to fΣ and α, analogous to the

results of the preceding subsection.

2. Twin Higgs — SO(8)/SO(7)

In the Twin model, the H sector has an SO(8)H
global symmetry and the Σ sector has a custodial

SO(4)ΣA × SO(4)ΣB × Z2 global symmetry. The cou-

pling of the H and Σ sector extends the form of the

SO(5)/SO(4) model, explicitly breaking the global sym-

As for the composite example, the higher-order terms

are parametrically the same size as calculated in the lin-
ear realization for ΛΣ (cid:39) 4πfΣ, such that the tadpole due
to fH can readily constitute a signiﬁcant perturbation on
the ΣB sector. In addition, we expect the operators in the
pNGB potential to be generated with O(1) coeﬃcients,
permitting the possibility that these terms can generate

additional positive contributions to α, perhaps alleviat-

ing the need for additional UV contributions required to

overcome the δα < 0 from the SM top sector.

tor are therefore directly connected as Λ3
ΣA ∼ κ2fH , and
the viable parameter space fΣA ∼ 50 − 70 GeV requires
fH ∼ TeV. Alternatively, if GA and GB are indepen-
dent, the Twin sector can induce fΣB (cid:29) fΣA which can
increase the size of the extra contributions to the Higgs

potential.

C. UV Considerations

Finally, we highlight some of the additional important

tempting to explain the origin of the Higgs and Σ sectors.

pending on their sign and size, these terms may lead
to complete breaking of SU (2)B × U (1)B (in the event
that Twin hypercharge is gauged).
In particular, as
fH (cid:29) vH and fΣB ∼ fΣA, higher-order terms can drive
SU (2) alignment of (cid:104)HA(cid:105) and (cid:104)ΣA(cid:105) but misalignment
of (cid:104)HB(cid:105) and (cid:104)ΣB(cid:105) even with Z2-symmetry. In this case,
SU (2)B×U (1)B is fully broken while SU (2)A×U (1)A →
U (1)EM, avoiding a massless Twin hypercharge boson.

Finally, in the Twin case, there is the additional ques-

tion of the origin of the two auxiliary sectors. ΣA and
ΣB may be part of a single strongly-interacting gauge
sector G or two independent strongly-interacting sectors
GA and GB related by the Z2. The former naturally ad-

mits the appealing “waterfall” of induced breakings de-

scribed above. In the linear sigma model, this case corre-

sponds to a large coupling between the A and B sectors,
λΣ ∼ δΣ—analogously, for a single strongly-coupled sec-
tor, we expect sizable couplings between ΣA and ΣB.
The condensation in the Higgs sector at ΛH generates
a scale in the B auxiliary sector, triggering its conden-

sation. For example, the Σ sector could be a confor-

EWSB requires α > 0. This does not present a par-

ticular challenge in the MCHM, as gauge contributions

to α are positive and UV-sensitive, so can easily be ar-

ranged to give α > 0 if the gauge partners are heavier

than the top partners. Depending on the structure of

the Σ sector, however, there can also be UV contribu-
tions to the Higgs potential ∝ κ2, which may need to be
suppressed to avoid tuning. For example, Σ can emerge

from an asymptotically free technicolor-like sector that

is weakly coupled at the scale ΛH with OΣ formed from

contributions from the Σ sector even more desirable. For-

tunately, as seen in the linear sigma model of Sec. IV A,

these contributions can be enhanced due to the presence

of the extra B sector with fΣB ∼> fΣA, and can read-

ily be of comparable size to the experimentally-required

value αobs. Because the top sector radiative contribution
can also be O(αobs) (see Sec. III B), this means Σ sector
IR contributions are in principle suﬃcient to generate

α = αobs > 0.

Even if IR contributions to α from the Σ sector are

insuﬃcient, though, other possible sources for α > 0 ex-

ist. These include embedding the τ or bottom sector

in a larger representation of SO(8), which can give a

UV contribution to α of the right sign and size to tune

against the top contribution, analogous to the mechanism

V. EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS

Induced EWSB is subject to both indirect constraints

from measurements of Higgs properties and electroweak

precision tests, and direct constraints from searches for

additional states associated with the auxiliary sector.

These constraints have been extensively studied in [40],

with emphasis on phenomenological models and applica-

tions to supersymmetry. Notably, there exists a tension

between electroweak precision tests and direct searches

for vector resonances, which favor larger values of fΣ,

and Higgs measurements (both of Higgs properties and

searches for extended Higgs sector states), which favor

smaller values of fΣ. Here, we summarize these results,

and highlight some of the main diﬀerences in the MCHM

for increasing β in SO(5)/SO(4) models [53]. In Twin

or Twin scenario.

Higgs models based on an SU (4)/SU (3) coset, overly-
large contributions from the gauge sector, δα ∼ g2, may
be a concern [46], but such contributions are forbidden if

the global symmetry is expanded to SO(8) [7, 46]. This

indicates small explicit breakings of SO(8) to SU (4) may

also be useful to obtain α > 0.

A UV completion should also address the potentially

dissatisfying coincidence of scales, fΣ ∼< mh ∼ v.

weakly-coupled, the constraints vary due to the mixing

between the Higgs and the radial mode of the auxiliary

sector. This mode couples to gauge bosons but not to

fermions, so mixing partially restores the depletion of κV
while also reducing the enhancement of κf .

While this counteracts the enhancement of Higgs cou-

vector bosons. Since current measurements favor a slight

enhancement κV = 1.05 > 1, constraints on fΣ can be
somewhat more stringent for smaller values of fH than
in the usual induced EWSB scenario described above.

For Twin Higgs models, there is further additional sup-

pression of Higgs couplings to visible SM states due to

decays to Twin sector states [58]. For instance, suppos-

ing the couplings to SM and Twin b quarks respect the

In Fig. 4, we plot the (κV , κf ) that can occur in in-
duced EWSB models with a pNGB Higgs and a strongly-

coupled auxiliary sector, as well as the combined ATLAS

and CMS measurements [17]. We consider both a general

central value (κV , κf ) = (1, 1).

There are also constraints from direct searches for

states associated with the auxiliary sector, which gen-

erally require these states to be at least somewhat heavy.

First, there are the additional Higgs sector states due to

the presence of a second electroweak doublet Σ(A). These
states have masses related to the size of the H · Σ terms

In our case this relationship is modiﬁed by higher-order

terms. First,

in the pNGB Higgs potential, α > 0

yields a negative quartic, which would tend to enhance

mA relative to the above estimate, but we also expect
higher-order terms including β (cid:54)= 0 to be generated.
For instance, the natural 5 + 1 top sectors considered
in Sec. III A tend to generate (positive) β (cid:39) βSM
2 , which
would decrease mA, while for Twin Higgs models unbro-
ken Z2 enforces β = −α, further enhancing mA. Second,
for a strongly-coupled auxiliary sector, higher-order H·Σ
terms can yield O(1) corrections, as in Eq. (47). These
two eﬀects represent a ‘theoretical uncertainty’ in the re-

lation between (fH , fΣ) and the mass of Higgs resonances
in the auxiliary sector.

we expect vector resonances with masses mρ ∼ 4πfΣ
associated with the strong dynamics [63]. These “tech-

nirhos” are constrained both by direct searches (notably,
ρ±
surements [32]. The exact constraints depend on the

→ W ±Z [64]) and by electroweak precision mea-

properties of the technirhos, which depend on the de-

tails of the unknown strong dynamics. However, for

lighter technirhos (such as those predicted by a QCD-like

auxiliary sector), these can be the dominant constraints,

eliminating the majority of the allowed parameter space

[40]. Thus, for a truly strongly-coupled auxiliary sector,

the strong dynamics must be such that the vector reso-

nances are at least somewhat heavy. For instance, the

(non-excluded) strongly-coupled benchmarks considered

in [40] would require fΣ∼> 50− 55 GeV. Meanwhile, per-
turbativity generally places an upper bound on mρ.

Finally, for pNGB Higgs models, top partner searches

are of course also relevant. There are a variety of

searches focusing on a minimal charge-2/3 top partner
decaying via T → bW, tZ, th, which currently require
mT ∼> 700 GeV [12–14]. A top partner of this variety is

expected to be somewhat light as it is responsible for cut-

ting oﬀ quadratic divergences due to the SM top quark.

However, in ‘maximally natural’ models, the full global

symmetry is likely restored not too far above mT (see
Sec. III). As a result, searches for other states implied by

the global symmetry, such as heavy charge-1/3 B-quarks

[65, 66] or exotic charge-5/3 quarks [65, 67] (present in

complete multiplets of custodial SO(4)) may also be rel-

evant [68, 69].

In particular, for Twin Higgs models,

the lightest top partner responsible for regulating the

quadratic divergences is uncolored, leading to weak con-

straints from the LHC. But natural models likely exhibit

colored top partners not too much heavier than the un-

colored twin top (as in Sec. III B), which may be probed
up to m∗ ∼ 2.5 TeV at the LHC [70].

VI. CONCLUSION

FIG. 5.
Regions of (fH , fΣ) excluded by Higgs coupling
measurements (hatched) and direct A → Zh searches (solid)

Solid regions correspond to mA with β = 0 for MCHM and
β = α for Twin Higgs, see text for details. Dashed blue
contours represent the eﬀect of rescaling m2
A by 0.6 (lower) or
1.4 (upper) and thus represent the theoretical uncertainty on
the solid blue line. The dashed black line denotes approximate
lower bound fΣ∼> 50 GeV from vector resonance searches.

Direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons constrain mA,
with the dominant constraint in much of the parame-
ter space coming from the CMS search for A → Zh →
(cid:96)+(cid:96)−b¯b [62], which requires mA ∼> 460 GeV [40].
In
Fig. 5, we show approximate constraints from A → Zh
and Higgs property measurements in the (fH , fΣ) plane,
again supposing a strongly-coupled auxiliary sector. To
determine mA, we rescale mA,0 by κ
κ0
mined from Eq. (7) for the Minimal Composite model

where κ is deter-

(i.e., neglecting β) and from Eq. (14) with β = α for the
Twin Higgs model (i.e., neglecting Z2 breaking). In both
cases, this corresponds to neglecting corrections due to
higher-order H · Σ terms. We have tested the approxi-
mate size of the corrections mentioned above in several

speciﬁc cases; to capture and summarize the potential

importance of the neglected eﬀects, we also show the im-
pact of rescaling m2
A for the MCHM. An
uncertainty band of similar proportion also applies for

the pNGB Higgs potential, which focus on increasing the

quartic term β (e.g., Little Higgs), the tadpole structure
simply makes β irrelevant in the limit vH (cid:28) fH .

In SO(5)/SO(4) minimal composite Higgs models

(MCHM), this mechanism makes viable the minimal

representations of the 3rd generation partners (as in

MCHM5+1). The resulting tuning is comparable to a

purely radiative potential generated by 3rd generation

partners in larger representations. In the case of the Twin

Higgs, the radiative contributions from the minimal rep-

resentations of the top sector can be made substantially

smaller, and the mechanism of induced EWSB allows the
tuning to be reduced by a factor of ∼ 5 compared to
the ‘irreducible’ f 2

tial. This allows a fully natural pNGB potential with
fH (cid:39) 1 TeV and colored top partners at ∼ 2 TeV. The
tadpole mechanism in the Twin Higgs model also has the
advantage of incorporating spontaneous Z2 breaking and
full breaking of the mirror U (1)EM,B.

While these pNGB Higgs models share many fea-

tures in common with supersymmetric models of in-

duced EWSB [27, 28, 36–40], there are interesting diﬀer-

ences. First, in SUSY models, both the H and Σ sectors

inherit their scale from an external SUSY breaking sec-

tor, while in the composite pNGB case the scale fH can
directly trigger fΣ. Second, although in both cases the

striking phenomenology is in the Higgs sector, Higgs com-

positeness generates additional deviations in Higgs prop-

erties not present in SUSY. If the fermionic top partners

of the pNGB Higgs model are within reach, their signa-

tures also diﬀer substantially from the signatures of the

scalar stops in SUSY models.

physics.

In tadpole-induced pNGB Higgs models, a wealth of

interesting phenomenology from both the Σ sector and

Higgs compositeness may be within reach of the LHC.

The plethora of signals could include modiﬁcations of

Higgs properties due to both compositeness and the aux-

iliary EWSB component, extra charged and pseudoscalar

Higgs states, auxiliary sector vector resonances lighter

than 1 TeV, and colored composite top partners at ∼>

TeV. In the case of the Twin Higgs, further consequences

of the mirror sector,

including invisible and/or exotic

Higgs decays, may be observable.

It has not escaped

our attention that the auxiliary sector generically con-
tains composite singlet pseudoscalars at the scale ΛΣ ∼
4πfΣ ∼ 750 GeV with large branching ratios to dipho-
tons [71–77], which may be able to explain recent hints

for a resonance at LHC13 [78, 79]. In particular, small

mixings between the auxiliary sector and singlet pseu-

doscalars in the composite Higgs sector [80–83] can lead

to an appreciable gluon fusion production cross section

even if the auxiliary sector contains no colored states.

Not only can tadpole-induced models feature a pNGB

potential with a fully natural scale for EWSB, but in

fact searches at LHC13 and future colliders will likely be

able to probe the entire remaining range of viable models

independent of any naturalness arguments.

generalizes the 5+1 model to the twin case by extending the coset to SO(8)/SO(7) and including B-sector elementary

and composite tops,
