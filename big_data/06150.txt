Abstract. Scattering of a 2D Dirac electrons on a rectangular matrix potential
barrier is considered using the formalism of spinor transfer matrices. It is shown,
in particular, that in the absence of the mass term, the Klein tunneling is not
necessarily suppressed but occurs at oblique incidence. The formalism is applied
to studying waveguiding modes of the barrier, which are supported by the edge and
bulk states. The condition of existence of the uni-directionality property is found.
We show that the band of edge states is always ﬁnite with massless excitations,
while the spectrum of the bulk states, depending on parameters of the barrier,
may consist of the inﬁnite or ﬁnite band with both, massive and massless, low-
energy excitations. The eﬀect of the Zeeman term is considered and the condition
of appearance of two distinct energy dependent directions corresponding to the
Klein tunneling is found.

1. Introduction

The unique electron properties of graphene sparked the signiﬁcant interest in
applications of graphene and, more generally, 2D systems supporting massless electron
excitations, Dirac electrons. The main challenge in such applications has appeared
to stem from the same unique properties.
In order to control the electron ﬂow, it
is necessary to be able to restrict its motion in desired way and the eﬀect of Klein
tunneling (KT) [1, 2] makes this very diﬃcult: simple scalar potential is not suﬃcient
for keeping the electron from escaping. This circumstance made researchers to consider
more general potentials and it was found that Dirac massless electrons can be conﬁned
with the help of magnetic barriers [3, 4, 5]. This resulted in the signiﬁcant attention
to the problem of propagation of Dirac electrons in the presence of barriers created
by both electric and magnetic ﬁelds [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Experimentally, the vector
potential barrier can be implemented with the help of ferromagnetic stripes with the
opposite orientations of magnetization [13, 14, 15] as is illustrated in ﬁgure 1(a).

Even in the case of piece-wise constant vector and scalar components of the
potential, the scattering problem on such barrier turned out to be unexpectedly
cumbersome due to the number of parameters characterizing and determining the
electron motion and inapplicability of the intuition built by the standard problem of a

particle described by the Schrodinger equation scattering on a barrier. As a result, the
main analysis of scattering of Dirac electrons on magneto-electric barriers is done for
barriers with speciﬁc parameters. This makes it diﬃcult to draw the general conclusion
about the eﬀect of such barriers on the electron motion.

We consider the problem of the electron propagation in the presence of a
rectangular matrix potential barrier and approach it using the developed formalism of
spinor transfer matrices. This technique proves to be eﬃcient and allows us to provide
the general description of the eﬀect of the barrier. We were able to derive compact
expressions relating the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcient to the geometry of
spinor eigenstates. They show that in the absence of mismatch of the electron mass
inside and outside the barrier, the barrier may admit the KT at oblique directions.
Moreover, in the case when the barrier is created by the ferromagnetic gate on the
surface of a topological insulator, the Zeeman interaction may lead to appearance of
two distinct directions corresponding to the KT.

We apply the formalism of spinor transfer matrices to a detailed analysis of
waveguiding properties of the matrix potential barrier. This problem considered
for the case of combined magnetic-electrostatic barriers on graphene and other 2D
materials was the object of consideration of many publications [16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 11, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] with the most attention, however, paid to the bulk states,
when the electron states are extended across the barrier. The edge states, with the
electron localized near the boundaries of the barrier, appeared only in the context of
the mass mismatch [11]. Here we show that waveguiding modes based on both, edge
and bulk states, can be approached equally. The dispersion equation governing the
waveguiding modes can be easily derived using the formalism of the spinor transfer
matrices. We analyze the obtained transcendental equations in order to describe
the dependence of general properties of the waveguiding modes on parameters of the
barrier. In particular, we show that in order to support waveguiding based on edge
states the mass mismatch is not required.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:

in Section 2 we introduce spin
coherent states in a spatially homogeneous matrix potential, in Section 3 we develop
the formalism of spinor transfer matrices and apply it for studying scattering on the
rectangular barrier, in Section 4 we consider waveguiding properties of the barrier,
and in Section 5 we consider the case when the magnetic ﬁeld at the boundaries of
the barrier aﬀects the electron motion due to the Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian.

The equation of motion of the Dirac electron with energy  in the presence of

where v is the Fermi velocity. In order to shorten formulas, it is convenient to exclude
v by redeﬁning either spatial r → r/v or energy  → v scales. Thus, in what follows
we take v = 1.
In Eq. (1) σ = σxex + σyey + σzez is the usual vector of Pauli matrices and
p · σ ≡ pxσx + pyσy. Employing the fact that any 2 × 2 matrix can be expanded over

{(cid:98)1, σx, σy, σz}, where(cid:98)1 is the identity matrix, we present

(cid:98)U (x) = V (x)(cid:98)1 + U (x) · σ.

Both V (x) and U (x) are assumed to be non-zero only inside the barrier, xL ≤ x ≤ xR,
where V (x) = V and U (x) = U , as illustrated in ﬁgure 1(b). It should be noted,
however, that arbitrary Ux(x) can be accounted for by the gauge transformation
ψ(r) → ψ(r) exp
. Thus, the eﬀect of this component of the matrix
potential reduces to simple acquiring the phase factor and, therefore, without the loss
of generality one can assume that Ux(x) ≡ 0.

The scattering of the Dirac electron on such barrier can be analyzed in the
usual way considering the appropriate solutions in regions I, II, III and imposing
the condition of continuity of ψ(r) at the boundaries of the barrier. Within the
regions with constant U and V the solutions are sought in the form of plane waves
ψ(r; k) = ψkeik·r. The spinor ψk satisﬁes

where(cid:101) =  − V and the eﬀective ﬁeld h is deﬁned as
the magnetic ﬁeld h. The energies of the states are (cid:101)± = ±|h|, where |h| =

Thus inside regions I, II and III the general solution of Eq. (1) is presented as
a superposition of ψ(r; k) corresponding to the same energy . The invariance with
respect to translations along the y-axis implies that ky is a good quantum number and
therefore scattered states can be characterized by  and ky. Thus for the given barrier
and energy the eﬀective ﬁeld h has deﬁnite |h|, hy and hz. On the other hand, the
barrier breaks the translational symmetry along x-axis and for given  and ky we have
two possible values for kx corresponding to diﬀerent signs of hx keeping |h| intact,

This consideration shows that the representation in terms of the superposition
of plane waves is not trouble free. When q = 0 it provides only one solution, while
Eq. (1) for ﬁxed ky is essentially the second order ODE and should have two linearly

independent solutions. Since q = 0 is rather an exceptional case we postpone its
detailed discussion to the next section, while for now we assume that q (cid:54)= 0 and that,
indeed, plane wave expansion covers all solutions.

Once the eﬀective ﬁelds, h(1,2) = h(k(1,2), U ), are found, we can use
Eq. (3) to describe the respective spin states. They are conveniently presented
in terms of spin coherent states [27, 28]. To vector n with Cartesian coordinates
(sin(θ) cos(φ), sin(θ) sin(φ), cos(θ)), where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal
angle, we assign the state

|n(cid:105) = exp [−iσ · mθ/2]|+(cid:105) ,

(7)
where m = (− sin(φ), cos(φ), 0) is a unit vector in the xy-plane perpendicular to n
and ez. In terms of amplitudes with respect to the quantization axis along ez the
state |n(cid:105) is

The overlap of two coherent states can be presented in a “covariant” form [27]

where A(n, n(cid:48)) = A(n, n(cid:48), ez) is the oriented area of the spherical triangle with vertices

Eq. (3) have the simple form: (cid:12)(cid:12)n(1,2)(cid:11) with n(1,2) = h(1,2)/|(cid:101)|. It should be noted that
the condition q2 > 0 holds only when |(cid:101)| > 0, thus the direction of the spin coherent

state in this case is always well-deﬁned.

The situation is more complex when q2 < 0.

In this case h has imaginary x-
component and the orientation of the coherent state should be found directly from
Eq. (3). First, we assume that hy > 0 and Uz = 0 and then extend the consideration
to the general case. Let hx = iκ, then Eq. (3) can be written as

(11)
Comparing with Eq. (8) we can see that Eq. (11) describes a state |n(cid:105) with n lying
in the yz-plane. The polar angle of n can be presented as θ = π/2 + ∆θ, where ∆θ is
the angle of deviation from the y-axis and is found to be

.

tan(∆θ) =

(12)
The azimuthal angle is φ = π/2 when  > V and φ = −π/2 otherwise. The second
solution, corresponding to hx = −iκ is found by simple reversing the sign of κ. Thus,
it is characterized by the same azimuthal angle but is deviated from the y-axis down.
The case with arbitrary sign of hy and Uz (cid:54)= 0 can be studied using the same
approach. For this we rotate the coordinate system for Eq. (3) around the x-axis
in such way that the transformed y-axis is oriented along the projection of h on the
yz-plane, that is along the vector hyz = (0, hy, hz). In these coordinates Eq. (3) takes

the same form as (10) with
z instead of hy. The polar angle of n is presented
then as θ = θ0 + ∆θ, where θ0 is the polar angle of hyz and ∆θ is determined by
Eq. (12). The azimuthal angle, in turn, depends on the sign of hy: if hy > 0, then φ

is determined by the same rule as above: φ = sign((cid:101))π/2; if, however, hy < 0, then
the rule is reversed φ = −sign((cid:101))π/2.

Thus, roughly speaking, when hx is imaginary its magnitude determines the
deviation of the spinor from the direction of vector hyz in the yz-plane (see ﬁgure 2).
As we can see, when q2 < 0, for a given energy  we as well have two states
= ±i|q| and spins oriented along n(1,2). We enumerate the

An important symmetry of vectors n(1) and n(2) representing spinor states should
be noted. For both cases, q2 > 0 and q2 < 0, vectors n(1), n(2) and hyz lie in the
same plane, and n(1) and n(2) are related through reﬂection about hyz in this plane.
This symmetry will be extensively used below.

In order to formally manifest the symmetry it is convenient to present eigenstates

of Eq. (3) using dilation operators. For the case q2 > 0, we have

q2 < 0, so that q = iκ with κ > 0, we obtain

= K (1,2) exp (bhyz · σ/2)|±ex(cid:105) ,

where K (1,2) = e±iφ/2(cid:112)q/|(cid:101)|, cosh(bhyz) = |(cid:101)|/q, sinh(bhyz) = sign((cid:101))hyz/q. When
where l = hyz × ex/hyz, C (1) = (cid:112)κ/hyz, C (2) = i(cid:112)κ/hyz, cosh(bhyz) = hyz/κ,

Inside regions I, II and III we have

The analysis above shows that Eq. (3) can be regarded as deﬁning two distributions of
directions n(1)(x) and n(1)(x), corresponding to forward and backward propagating
modes. The spatial inhomogeneity of U (x) and V (x) together with the continuity
condition couple these distributions leading to scattering, which is conveniently
described by the formalism of transfer-matrices.

This consideration can be generalized straightforwardly to the case of multiple

The ﬁrst condition is responsible for the periodic variation of the reﬂection coeﬃcient
with the width of the barrier due to the interference eﬀect. The second condition is
satisﬁed when directions of the spins inside and outside the barrier coincide. In this
case the reﬂection coeﬃcient is zero regardless the width of the barrier and thus is
associated with the KT.
Obviously, condition (30) cannot be satisﬁed when Uz (cid:54)= 0. Thus the respective
barriers (often called mass barriers) completely suppress the KT. The eﬀect of V and

Figure 3. The angular dependence of the transmission coeﬃcient through the
barrier with Uy/ = 1, V / = 3 for two diﬀerent widths: (dashed line) d = 1
and (solid line) d = 10 in the units adopted in the main text. For the magnetic
barrier with B = 0.5 T the spectra correspond to  = 19 meV, V = 57 meV and
d = 37 nm and d = 370 nm, respectively. The KT takes place at oblique incidence
with θ = arcsin(−V /Uy) ≈ −20◦.

Uy on the KT is less straightforward. It follows from Eq. (28) that in the case Uz = 0
the KT takes place when

ky = − Uy
V

.

(31)

Thus, when the barrier contains both V and Uy, the KT is not necessarily suppressed
but may appear for obliquely incident Dirac electron as is illustrated in ﬁgure 3.

With increasing Uy the Klein direction deviates more from normal until it becomes
parallel to the boundary of the barrier. Further increase of Uy will lead to suppression
of the KT. Thus, in order for KT to exist, Uy and V in the barrier must satisfy

|Uy| < |V |.

(32)

We would like to remark that if the KT condition is satisﬁed for an electron
incident with ky (cid:54)= 0 from the left, then the condition is not fulﬁlled for the electron
with time reversed trajectory. In the latter case ky has the opposite sign and Eq. (31)
no longer holds. In order to recover the KT the full time reversal transformation must
be performed, which includes reversing U .

This analysis directly applies to an electron in graphene in the presence of scalar
and vector potential barrier. In this case V (x) has the meaning of the scalar potential
and Ux and Uy are the respective components of the vector potential, which creates

the magnetic ﬁeld B(x) = −BlBez[δ(x − xL) − δ(x − xR)], where lB = (cid:112)/eB,

B0lB = Uy/e and e is the magnitude of the electron charge. The eﬀect of such magnetic
barrier on the KT was studied in Refs. [6, 10]. In [6] the KT at oblique directions was
observed numerically, while in [10] it was concluded that the addition of the magnetic

Dirac electrons in the presence of matrix potential barrier

10

barrier to the scalar potential barrier suppresses the KT. Our consideration above
resolves unambigously this controversy. The magnetic barrier alone, indeed, doesn’t
demonstrate the KT. However, when it is accompanied with the scalar potential such
that condition (32) is fulﬁlled, the KT restores at oblique incidence.

It should be emphasized that the KT takes place when the direction of the
eigen-spinors is uniform across the system. In the non-attenuated regime, i.e. when
q2 > 0, this is equivalent to a uniform distribution of the directions of the eﬀective

ﬁeld, h(x)/(cid:101)(x) = n(x) = const. Thus the oblique KT is the local property of

the matrix potential governing the motion of the Dirac electron and, therefore, it
holds for barriers with more complex spatial variation of the potentials. Evidently, if
Uy(x)/V (x) = c < 1 is a constant across the barrier, then such barrier is reﬂection-
less for electrons incident at the angle χ = − arcsin(c) counted from the normal to the
boundary. Conversely, this shows that in the barriers with a general spatial variation of
the scalar and vector components the KT condition is, generally speaking, broken. For
example, in anti-parallel ferromagnetic gates of ﬁnite width, ∆x, the vector potential
varies continuously and, except when the scalar potential is carefully chosen to satisfy
Uy(x)/V (x) = c < 1, the condition n(x) = const doesn’t hold.

A detailed analysis of a general coordinate dependent matrix potential goes

full potential and (cid:98)U (x) is its approximation by the rectangular barrier near its left
boundary. Thus, ∆(cid:98)U (x) diﬀers from zero only inside the gate. Then it can be seen that

the transfer matrix we need to analyze closer Eq. (1) in the case when(cid:101)2 = h2
where (cid:98)P = ((cid:101) − σ · hyz)/(2(cid:101)) and hyz = (0, hII;y, hII;z).
We notice that det(2(cid:101)(cid:98)P ) = q2 and, moreover, when q = 0, one has (cid:98)P 2 = (cid:98)P , thus
(cid:98)P is a projector. The components of hyz are real and therefore the eigenstates of (cid:98)P are
|±nyz(cid:105), where nyz = hyz/(cid:101) and therefore (cid:98)P = |−nyz(cid:105)(cid:104)−nyz|. Taking into account
that (cid:98)P can be diagonalized by rotating the coordinate system around the x-axis, we

(35)

obtain the general solution of Eq. (35) for the case q = 0:

|ψ(cid:105) = |ψ0(cid:105) − 2(cid:101)x|nyz(cid:105)(cid:104)−nyz| ψ0(cid:105),

(36)
where |ψ0(cid:105) is an arbitrary spin state. The second terms in this expression is of secular
form and is missed in the representation in terms of plane waves.

Enforcing the continuity at the boundaries of the barrier we ﬁnd that the transfer

matrix through the barrier in the case q = 0 has the form

4. Matrix potential barriers as waveguides

We apply the developed technique to analysis of waveguiding properties of the barrier,
or, equivalently, of states localized on the barrier. In general the barrier supports two
kinds of such states diﬀering by the structure of the fermion state inside the barrier.

This expression is valid in both cases, q2 > 0 and q2 < 0. When q2 > 0 it suggests
an interesting interpretation: the phase variation inside the barrier should match the
geometric phase spanned by the spin states inside and outside: γB − γG = πm with
integer m, where γB = qd and γG = A(n(1)

interpretation in some generalized form is valid also in the case of edge states.

where cosh(bIIhyz) = |(cid:101)|/q and sinh(bIIhyz) = hyzsign((cid:101))/q. In particular, the zero of

when the width of the barrier satisﬁes qd = πn with integer n or for an arbitrary
width of the barrier when hyz · ez = 0 and at the same time bI = bIIhyz · ey. These
conditions are, of course, identical to those discussed above.

For the case q = iκII we have

(cid:98)Ttot = ebIIhyz·σ/2e−κIIdl·σe−bIIhyz·σ/2,

(47)

Dirac electrons in the presence of matrix potential barrier

where l = hyz × ex/hyz, sinh(bIIhyz) =(cid:101)/κII, cosh(bIIhyz) = hyz/κII.

The convenience of representations (45) and (47) is that in both cases q2 > 0 and

q2 < 0 the transfer matrix takes the same form

(cid:98)Ttot = eid(cid:101)σx−dhyzl·σ,

which allows one to treat bulk and edge states on the same footing.

In order to support the localized state the transfer matrix through the barrier
should correspond to rotating vector n(2)
. In the case
q2 > 0 according to Eq. (45) this is eventually achieved by the conventional rotation
around the x-axis, which yields the geometric interpretation mentioned above.
In
the case of edge states the corresponding rotation is hyperbolic as is illustrated by
Eqs. (13) and (14). Thus the waveguiding modes supported by the bulk states may
occupy multiple bands, while the edge states may support only the single band.

D

The general structure of the spectrum of edge states is determined by the overlap
of intervals, where ky may reside in order to have positive κI, κII and D, as is illustrated
in ﬁgure 4. The general form of the spectrum is determined by simple relations between
V and Uy. It can be seen that solutions of Eq. (50) with ky > 0 and ky < 0 may exist
only when V < −Uy and V < Uy, respectively. Thus, for suﬃciently deep attracting
barriers, V < 0 and |V | > |Uy|, Eq. (50) may support for the same energy solutions
with both ky > 0 and ky < 0. When V increases so that |V | < |Uy|, for a particular
energy there may be only one solution and ky and Uy must be of opposite signs. With
further increase of V , in suﬃciently strong repulsive potentials V > |Uy| no solutions
of Eq. (50) exist.
We would like to emphasize that the condition of existence of waveguiding modes
supported by the edge states, V < |Uy|, does not require the scalar potential to be
attractive nor the presence of the mass gap (i.e. when Uz (cid:54)= 0).

In order to avoid overly cumbersome expressions we discuss details of the spectrum
in the case when V = 0 and we take for deﬁniteness Uy < 0, so that only solutions with
ky > 0 may exist. As can be seen from ﬁgure 4 the maximal energy of the edge states
cannot exceed the value determined by the intersection of the curve κII(ky, ) = 0 with
either D(ky, ) = 0 (if |Uy/Uz| <

In contrast to the previous case, the phases should match up to multiples of π.
According to Eq. (45), this corresponds to diﬀerent number of full rotations of the
incoming spin state inside the barrier. States corresponding to n = 0 constitute the
fundamental band and those with n > 0 form higher bands.

The dependence of the spectrum of localized states on the relation between V
and Uy is more complex, than in the previous case. Let us assume for concreteness
that Uy < 0. An analysis of conditions q2 > 0 and κ2
I > 0 (see ﬁgure 5) shows that
there are three possibilities:
(i) V < |Uy|. There are no solutions with ky < 0, while states with ky > 0 occupy
(ii) |Uy| < V . The inﬁnite band disappears. A ﬁnite band of states with ky > 0 may
exist if additionally V > |Uz| (see ﬁgure 5(b)). Thus, if |Uy| < V < |Uz|, there
are no localized states, either bulk or edge.

of the variation of γB(ky) and γG(ky). The latter, in turn, depends on the position of
the pole of Eq. (58), depicted by dotted lines in ﬁgure 5. This leads to a cumbersome

These inequalities deﬁne two bands formed by bulk states. One band extends to
inﬁnity, while another, existing when V > 1/d, is ﬁnite.

The inﬁnite band consists of overlapping fundamental band and higher bands.
The dispersion law of the fundamental near U is linear, thus the respective excitations
are massless. The spectrum of higher bands, however, shows an interesting feature.
Let us consider the n-th band with n > 1. The form of solutions of Eq. (57) essentially
depends on whether  > M or  < M, where M = (|Uy| + V )/2 is the minimal energy
such that  > k(−).
In the general case the region of massive bands is given by
z − V 2)/2(|Uy| − V ). If  < M, the position of the bottom of the n-th
M = (U 2
band, (n)

y + U 2
U , can be estimated as
U ≈ V + ∆(n),
(n)

(61)

where ∆(n) = πn/d. The dispersion law of the n-th band near (n)

U has the form

(ky − |Uy|)2

=  − (n)
U ,

(62)
where µ(n) = π(m + 1/2)/|Uy|d. Thus, only higher bands with numbers n ≤ nM =
[(|Uy| − V )d/2π], where [. . .] denotes taking the integer part, are massive.

2µ(n)

The ﬁnite band occupying 0 <  < D is also formed by overlapping fundamental
band with a ﬁnite number (possibly zero) of higher bands. The position of the top of
D = V − ∆(n). Thus the number of higher bands contained in the
the n-th band is (n)
low-energy ﬁnite band is N = [dV /π].

Only when V >

The interesting feature of the ﬁnite band is that excitations near the top of all
higher bands bands are massive and their masses match masses of the respective

excitations in the inﬁnite band but are negative. The dispersion laws are of the form

of the same sign as Uy. The bands occupied by states with ky < 0 and ky < 0 are,
however, of diﬀerent size, while contain approximately the same number of bands. For
a given energy  states with positive and negative ky are inside intervals (, k(+)) and
(k(−),−), respectively, where k(±) are given by Eq. (53). In order to estimate the
position of the n-th band, with n = 0, 1, . . ., we approximate γG ≈ π, which is a good

Within the adopted approximation for γG the dispersion laws of the bands are
approximately linear, implying massless excitations. This approximation, however,
breaks in the immediate vicinity of the top points of the bands.

It should be noted that Eqs. (63) and (64) predict the same number of bands with
positive and negative ky. While this result is obtained using a crude approximation
γG ≈ π, it breaks only in barriers with carefully chosen parameters, in which states
with negative ky may have one band less than the states with ky > 0. Equations (63)
and (64) also correctly predict that not all barriers with strong V may support
localized states. More accurate estimate for parameters of the barrier allowing at
least fundamental band can be obtained as γB( = 0, ky = 0) > π/2 yielding

5. Application for topological insulators

The results of the previous sections can be directly applied for description of electrons
moving along the surface of a topological insulator. In order to do this, two important
circumstances should be taken into account. First, the Hamiltonian of a free electron
in this case is usually taken in the Rashba form HR = vez · (σ × p), which is diﬀerent
from the electron Hamiltonian in graphene: HW = vσ · p. Hamiltonians HR and
HW, however, are equivalent up to diﬀerent choices of the σ-matrices, generators of
the su(2) algebra. Second, a consistent treatment of the matrix potential requires
taking into account the following circumstance. If, for instance, the matrix potential
is implemented by a vector potential, there’s a strong magnetic ﬁeld at the points of
strong variation of the vector potential. The Zeeman interaction of the electron spin
with this magnetic ﬁeld cannot be neglected and has to be taken into account.

In order to keep the general character of the consideration and to distinguish
the eﬀect of the Zeeman interaction, we formally distinguish the contribution of the
matrix and vector potentials and, thus, consider the equation of motion of the form

where A is the vector potential. The matrix potential (cid:98)U can be presented in terms of

ψ = ψ,

(65)

(cid:105)

(cid:104)
ez · (σ × (p − eA)) +(cid:98)U
(cid:98)U = V(cid:98)1 + U(cid:48) · σ

(66)
with U(cid:48) = U + gB, B = ∇× A is the magnetic ﬁeld and g is the gyromagnetic ratio.

In order to show the equivalence of Eq. (65) and (1) we introduce (cid:101)σx = −σy and
(cid:101)σy = σx, which correspond to the representation(cid:101)σxex +(cid:101)σyey = ez × (σxex + σyey).

σx,y,z

Dirac electrons in the presence of matrix potential barrier

It can be easily checked that(cid:101)σx,(cid:101)σy and σz satisfy the same commutation relations as
σx, σy and σz. In terms of (cid:101)σ = ((cid:101)σx,(cid:101)σy, σz) Eq. (65) is written as
where (cid:101)U = −eA + (cid:101)U⊥ + Uzez and (cid:101)U⊥ = ez × U(cid:48). Equation (67) has the same

ψ = ( − V )ψ,

(cid:17)

form as Eq. (1) but with vectors and spin states rotated by π/2 around the z-axis.
Thus the consideration of Section 2 can be simply repeated in the present case. In
order to restore the directions of the eﬀective ﬁelds and spin states for the electron
in topological insulator one only needs to perform the inverse rotation, i.e. rotate the
respective vectors by −π/2 around the z-axis. Having this relation established we will
ommit tilde while writing the components of the eﬀective matrix potential.
In order to obtain the transfer matrix, however, it is necessary to account for the
eﬀect of the Zeeman term. We introduce f (x) = θ(x − xL)θ(xR − x), where θ(x) is
the Heaviside step function, and denote A(x) = Af (x), so that B(x) = ∇f × A. In
the immediate vicinity of the boundary of the barrier one can neglect non-singular
contributions in Eq. (67) thus obtaining

The solution of this equation can be written as

terms of dilation operators:

It is seen that at x = xL and xR the spin experiences discontinuity described by the

dilation operators eg(cid:101)σyAy and e−g(cid:101)σyAy , respectively. These jumps are conveniently
accounted for in the representation of the transfer matrix through the barrier, (cid:98)Ttot, in
Comparing with expressions for matrix elements of (cid:98)Ttot, see e.g. Eqs. (46) and (49), it
of the dilation operator determining the incoming spin state: bI →(cid:101)bI = bI + 2gAy.

(cid:101)Ttot = e−g(cid:101)σyAy eid(cid:101)(cid:101)σx−dhyzl·σeg(cid:101)σyAy .

can be seen that the eﬀect of the spin jump reduces to a straightforward modiﬁcation

(70)

This allows us to apply directly the results of the previous sections.

First we consider the modiﬁcation of the KT condition. It has the same form as

Eq. (46), which results in

sinh(2gAy) [(cid:101) − ky(ky + Uy)] − cosh(2gAy) [kyV + Uy] = 0.

This equation determines the dependence of the direction of zero reﬂectivity for
arbitrary barrier width on parameters of the barrier:

ky = − 1
2

±(cid:113)

(V coth(2gAy) + Uy)

(Uy + V coth(2gAy))2 − 4(Uy coth(gAy) −(cid:101)).

We brieﬂy analyze this result assuming for concreteness that Ay > 0.

In the case  < V the eﬀect of the spin discontinuity is a modiﬁcation of the
dependence of the KT direction on the relation between Uy and V as is illustrated in
ﬁgure 6(a). Additionally the KT direction becomes energy dependent (see ﬁgure 6(b)).
At the same time the condition for the KT to exist remains the same as in the case
of continuous spin distribution, |Uy| < V .

i.e.

When  > V , however, new features appear. First of all, when |Uy| > V the KT

(73)

is no longer suppressed but rather appears at high energies,

Moreover, if  > V /(1 − e−4gAy ) there are two distinct KT directions.

In the similar way the eﬀect of the spin discontinuity on localized modes can be
studied. Using Eq. (70) in localization condition (49) we ﬁnd that the spin jump leads
to modiﬁcation of the geometric phase only

where

tanh(γG) =

κIκII

DT =(cid:101) [ cosh(2gAy) + ky sinh(2gAy)]

− (ky + Uy) [ky cosh(2gAy) +  sinh(2gAy)] .

(74)

(75)

The equation for localized states tanh(γB) = tanh(γG) can be analyzed using the same
approach as in the previous section. The eﬀect of the spin discontinuity can be seen
to be less signiﬁcant than for the KT. The main conditions for existence of localized
states and the boundary between massive and massless modes remain the same as
in the case of continuous spin. The exact positions of the band edges and masses
are modiﬁed. The explicit expressions, however, are too cumbersome and we do not
provide them here.

6. Conclusion

We present a detailed consideration of the propagation of a 2D Dirac electron in the
presence of a rectangular matrix potential barrier. We describe scattering with the

Dirac electrons in the presence of matrix potential barrier

help of spinor transfer matrices, which relate the orientation of the electron spin state
at diﬀerent points of the system given in terms of superposition of eigen spin coherent
states. We show that the Klein tunneling is suppressed in the presence of the mass
term, ∝ σz. In the absence of such contribution, the Klein tunneling is not suppressed
but is observed at an oblique direction with the angle of incidence determined by the
ratio between the scalar and vector components of the matrix potential.

The analysis of scattering is applied for studying of waveguiding properties of
the matrix potential barrier. Depending on the electron energy and parameters of
the barrier,
it may support states localized near the boundaries (edge states) or
penetrating the interior (bulk states). We describe the general properties of the
waveguiding modes, determine the widths of the bands and obtain the dispersion
laws of the low-energy excitations. We show that both kinds of waveguiding modes,
supported by edge and bulk states, may demonstrate the property of uni-directionality
when the barrier admits only waveguiding modes with kyUy < 0. We obtain general
conditions governing the general form of the spectrum of waveguiding modes.
In
particular, we show that in barriers with suﬃciently strong attractive scalar potential,
the waveguiding modes supported by the bulk states may demonstrate gapped
spectrum in wide barriers. When the scalar potential increases, the bottom of the
inﬁnite band raises and in suﬃciently strong repulsive scalar potential only the ﬁnite
band remains, which serves as the precursor to loosing the uni-directionality property.
While the waveguiding modes supported by the edge states are massless, those
supported by the balk states have both massive and massless bands. We ﬁnd the
energy region, where the massive bands are located, and ﬁnd their number.

In addition to the case when the electron is characterized by the pseudospin, we
consider the case the spin is real and thus is sensitive due to the Zeeman eﬀect to the
magnetic ﬁeld at the boundaries of the barrier. Its the most signiﬁcant manifestation
is the appearance at suﬃciently high energies of two distinct directions corresponding
to the Klein tunneling.
