ABSTRACT

Complex organic molecules (COMs) are detected in many regions of the interstellar medium, including prestellar cores. However,
their formation mechanisms in cold (∼ 10 K) cores remain to this date poorly understood. The formyl radical HCO is an important
candidate precursor for several O-bearing terrestrial COMs in cores, as an abundant building block of many of these molecules. Several
chemical routes have been proposed to account for its formation, both on grain surfaces, as an incompletely hydrogenated product of
H addition to frozen-out CO molecules, or in the gas phase, either the product of the reaction between H2CO and a radical, or as a
product of dissociative recombination of protonated formaldehyde H2COH+. The detection and abundance determination of H2COH+,
if present, could provide clues as to whether this latter scenario might apply. We searched for protonated formaldehyde H2COH+ in
the prestellar core L1689B using the IRAM 30 m telescope. The H2COH+ ion is unambiguously detected, for the ﬁrst time in a cold
(∼ 10 K) source. The derived abundance agrees with a scenario in which the formation of H2COH+ results from the protonation of
formaldehyde. We use this abundance value to constrain the branching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H2COH+ towards
the HCO channel to ∼ 10-30%. This value could however be smaller if HCO can be eﬃciently formed from gas-phase neutral-neutral
reactions, and we stress the need for laboratory measurements of the rate constants of these reactions at 10 K. Given the experimental
diﬃculties in measuring branching ratios experimentally, observations can bring valuable constraints on these values, and provide a
useful input for chemical networks.

1. Introduction

Despite their low temperatures, prestellar cores harbour a wealth
of chemical species. In recent years, complex organic molecules
(hereafter COMs), which were previously thought to trace
mainly warm gas in star forming regions have been detected in
prestellar sources (e.g. Bacmann et al. 2012; Vastel et al. 2014)
where the temperatures are around 10 K. The formation mecha-
nisms of the terrestrial COMs (i.e. which are stable under Earth-
like conditions) currently detected in the cold gas remain poorly
understood, and the respective roles of gas-phase reactions or
grain surface chemistry are debated.

Radicals like the formyl radical HCO or the methoxy rad-
ical CH3O have drawn attention as the possible precursors
of COMs, either in the gas-phase (Vasyunin & Herbst 2013;
Balucani et al. 2015) or on grain surfaces (Garrod & Herbst
2006). They are also important intermediates in the grain-surface
synthesis of methanol, as products of H-atom additions to CO
(e.g. Brown et al. 1988; Pirim & Krim 2011). These radicals
are also widely detected in the gas phase of prestellar cores
and cold clouds (Bacmann & Faure 2016; Agúndez et al. 2015b;
Gerin et al. 2009; Cernicharo et al. 2012).

In a previous survey of these radicals in a sample of prestellar
cores, Bacmann & Faure (2016) proposed that the HCO abun-

dances measured in the gas-phase could be accounted for by a
pure gas-phase scenario, in which HCO results from the dis-
sociative recombination of protonated formaldehyde H2COH+.
In dark clouds, H2COH+ is likely the product of the proto-
nation of H2CO, which is an abundant organic species (with
abundances generally around 10−10−10−9 in prestellar cores −
Bacmann et al. 2003; Guzmán et al. 2011). Proton donors like,
e.g. H+
3 , or HCO+, are the most abundant ions (with abun-
dances close to 10−9−10−8, see Aikawa et al. 2005; Flower et al.
2005, 2006). It is therefore expected that protonated formalde-
hyde H2COH+ would easily be formed. Previous searches by
Minh et al. (1993) towards Orion A and the two cold clouds
L183 and TMC-1 yielded no detection, and Ohishi et al. (1996)
detected H2COH+ only towards Sgr B2 and several hot cores,
and not towards the cold sources of their sample.

In this Letter, we present the ﬁrst detection of protonated
formaldehyde in a cold core, and discuss its abundance in terms
of the formation of the HCO radical by ion-molecule chemistry,
and the possibility to constrain the branching ratio towards HCO
of its dissociative recombination with electrons.

2. Observations and data analysis

The frequencies of the rotational transitions of H2COH+ were
determined by Chomiak et al. (1994) and Dore et al. (1995)
and were retrieved from the CDMS spectroscopy catalogue
(Müller et al. 2001; Müller et al. 2005). Line excitation is al-

ways an issue in cold (∼ 10 K) gas and only levels with a low
energy can be populated. To search for H2COH+, we therefore
selected transitions with upper level energies lower than ∼ 20 K,
which could be observed in a minimum of frequency setups,
and for which good atmospheric transmission did not require
very dry weather conditions. The chosen three lines at 2 mm and
their spectroscopic parameters are shown in Table 1, to which we
added a line at 3 mm from a previous project.

The observations were carried out in January and March
2012 for the 3 mm transition and in March 2015 for the 2 mm
transitions with the IRAM 30 m telescope located at Pico Veleta,
Spain, towards the prestellar core L1689B. The source was se-
lected on the grounds that its molecular lines are usually stronger
than in other similar sources (Bacmann & Faure 2016). The in-
tegration coordinates were α2000 = 16h34m48.30s and δ2000 =
−24◦38′04.0′′, corresponding to the peak of the millimetre dust
continuum emission. We used the receivers E090 and E150 oper-
ating at 3 mm and 2 mm, respectively, which were connected to
the Fourier Transform spectrometer (FTS) at a frequency res-
olution of ∼ 50 kHz (corresponding to velocity resolutions of
0.15 km/s at 102 GHz, 0.11 km/s at 130 GHz, and 0.09 km/s at
170 GHz). The weather conditions were good during the 2012
observing runs, and excellent during the March 2015 run, with
precipitable water vapour of 1 mm on average and system tem-
peratures of ∼ 80 K at 126-132 GHz and ∼ 130 K at 170 GHz.
Pointing was checked every 1.5 hours on a nearby quasar and
found to be within 2-3′′ at 2 mm and 3-4′′ at 3 mm. Focus was
performed on a strong quasar at the beginning of each observ-
ing session and on Mercury after sunrise. The data were taken
with the frequency switching mode with a frequency throw of
7.5 MHz. The antenna forward eﬃciency Feﬀ is 0.95 and 0.93
at 3 mm and 2 mm, respectively, and the main beam eﬃciencies
Beﬀ were taken to be 0.79, 0.77, 0.76, and 0.70 at 106.1 GHz,
126.9 GHz, 132.2 GHz, and 168.4 GHz, respectively. From inte-
grations carried out at diﬀerent oﬀsets (which will be discussed
elsewhere), we ﬁnd that the emission ﬁlls the main beam but is
not very extended, and therefore we used the main beam tem-
perature scale in our analysis, applying Tmb = Feﬀ/Beﬀ T ∗
a . The
main beam size is 24 ′′ at 106.1 GHz, 19′′ at 126.9 GHz and at
132.2 GHz, and 15′′ at 168.4 GHz.

The data were reduced using the IRAM GILDAS/CLASS1
software: the individual scans were averaged together and a low-
order (typically 3) polynomial was ﬁtted to line-free regions of
the spectra to subtract a baseline. The resulting spectra were then
folded to recover from the eﬀect of the frequency switching pro-
cedure. .

taneous emission coeﬃcient and higher upper level energy. The
line parameters (velocity integrated intensities, line widths, peak
line intensities) were determined by ﬁtting a Gaussian to each
line. The obtained values are presented in Table 2.

There are no available collisional coeﬃcients for H2COH+,
so we perform a simple derivation of the column density assum-
ing local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The method we use
has been described in Bacmann & Faure (2016). Brieﬂy, we cal-
culate the integrated intensities of the transitions under the LTE
assumption for a range of column density and excitation tem-
perature values, and perform a least-square ﬁt, deﬁning a χ2 be-
tween the calculated integrated intensities and the observed inte-
grated intensities, for the detected lines.

The best model yields a column density of 6.7 1011 cm−2 and
a temperature of 4.2 K. Reasonably good ﬁts (i.e. for which χ2

is within 1-σ of the minimum χ2 value) can be found for high
values of the column density (& 1.5 1012 cm−2) but these are ob-
tained for excitation temperatures which are below 3.5 K. We
limit ourselves to excitation temperatures above 3.7 K because
smaller values become unrealistic. With this additional condi-
tion, we ﬁnd that the beam averaged H2COH+ column density
is between 3.3 1011 cm−2 and 1.1 1012 cm−2. The non-detection
of the 102 GHz line does not bring supplementary constraints
despite the high sensitivity of the observation, because the low
excitation temperatures considered (< 5 K) are compatible with
a non-detection of this line even for unrealistically high column
densities (for which the other lines would be stronger and opti-
cally thick). Despite the low number of lines in our analysis, the
best ﬁt is only moderately good, as shown in Fig.2. This proba-
bly means that the excitation deviates from LTE.

4. Discussion and conclusions

This detection represents the ﬁrst detection of protonated
formaldehyde in a cold prestellar core. Former searches for this
ion in similar sources did not yield any detection, most probably
because of lack of sensitivity in the observations. The spectral
resolution of the H2COH+ non detections in the cold sources of
Ohishi et al. (1996) is ambiguous, but if we assume that it was
250 kHz, their rms noise of 20 mK was not low enough to detect
the 168.4 GHz line if it was as strong as in L1689B.

Most likely, the dominant reaction route to form H2COH+ in

−→ H2COH+ + H2

dark clouds is the protonation of formaldehyde
H2CO + HX+ kf
(1)
where HX+ stands for a proton donor. Indeed, both H2CO and
proton donors (like e.g. H+
3 , its deuterated isotopologues, or
HCO+) are abundant in prestellar cores, and exothermic ion-
molecule processes are generally fast. Bacmann & Faure (2016)

estimated the rate for reaction (1) with HX+ = H+
7 10−8 cm3s−1 at 10 K, using the locked dipole approximation.
Because of the diﬀerence in reduced mass, this rate constant be-
comes kf = 3.1 10−8 cm3s−1 at 10 K if HX+ = HCO+. The most
eﬃcient destruction route for H2COH+ is the dissociative recom-
bination (DR) with electrons:
H2COH+ + e− kd

Reaction (2) was studied experimentally by Hamberg et al.
(2007) (and recently by Osborne et al. 2015) who determined
kd = 9.9 10−6 cm3s−1 at 10 K.

At steady state, if H2COH+ is indeed formed mostly by re-
action (1) and destroyed by reaction (2), its abundance is simply
given by

[H2COH+] =

[HX+]
[e−]

[H2CO]

(3)

Substituting the reaction rates with their values for H+
3 and as-
suming the proton donor abundance is equal to the electron abun-
dance, we predict an abundance of [H2COH+] ≈ 0.007 [H2CO]
as mentioned in Bacmann & Faure (2016), or [H2COH+] ≈
0.003 [H2CO] if HCO+ is the main proton donor. Using an H2CO
column density of 1.3 1014 cm−2 (Bacmann et al. 2003), we ﬁnd
that the predicted H2COH+ column density Nmod derived from
equation (3) is 4.1 1011 − 9.1 1011 cm−2 (depending on the main
proton donor), consistent with the observed value we determine
in L1689B, Nobs = 6.7 1011 cm−2 within the uncertainties. This
also nicely conﬁrms the value of the destruction rate of H2COH+
measured by Hamberg et al. (2007) at 10 K.

Agúndez et al. (2015a) have run a time-dependent chemi-
cal model using the UMIST12 network (McElroy et al. 2013)
and derive [H2COH+] ∼ 8 10−4 − 10−3 [H2CO], about six times
smaller than our observed value. Though our model better re-
produces the observations, it considers only one formation and
one destruction route for H2COH+. The H2CO protonation reac-
tions in the UMIST12 network producing H2COH+ have smaller
reaction rates than the one we use (a factor of 2). Our model
might also overestimate the amount of proton donors reacting
with H2CO, since we assume it equal to the electron abundance.
We also neglect other destruction routes than electronic DR for
H2COH+, like proton transfer between H2COH+ and CH3OH or
NH3, but these are about 1000 times slower than DR at 10 K and
unlikely to be a cause for the discrepancy between both models.
The dissociative recombination of H2COH+ with electrons
has several output channels. According to the experiments by
Hamberg et al. (2007), the products of the reaction are

H2COH+ + e− → HCO + xH + yH2

→ CO + xH + yH2
→ H2CO + H
→ CH2 + OH
→ CH + H2O

where x and y are integers that account for the diﬀerent possible
combinations of H and H2 atoms in the products. The experimen-
tal branching ratios are 6% for CH2, 2% for CH, and 92% for the
channels where the C−O bond is conserved (i.e. CO, HCO, and
H2CO). This is in contrast to the dissociative recombination of
CH3OH for which the C−O bond is preserved in a minority of
channels (Geppert et al. 2006). In the case of H2COH+, the ex-
periment by Hamberg et al. (2007) did not distinguish between
HCO, CO and H2CO.

In order to account for the gas phase abundance of the
HCO radical in a sample of prestellar cores, and in particu-
lar the constant abundance ratio of ∼10 between H2CO and
HCO, Bacmann & Faure (2016) suggested that the observed
HCO/H2CO abundance ratio can be reproduced if HCO origi-
nates from the dissociative recombination of H2COH+, assuming
that the branching ratio of the DR is ∼10% for the HCO chan-
nel (reaction (4) above). Although the detection of H2COH+ in
a prestellar core does not provide unambiguous evidence that

HCO does form from the protonation of formaldehyde followed
by dissociative recombination, it is still in agreement with this
scenario, and allows us to directly constrain the branching ratio
of the dissociative recombination for the HCO channel. In this
frame, and assuming the main destruction route for HCO is with
a proton donor like H+
3 , the branching ratio f for HCO is given
by

kdd [HCO][H+

3 ] = f kd [H2COH+][e−],

where kdd = 5 10−8 cm−3s−1 is the destruction rate of HCO
3 at 10 K (Bacmann & Faure 2016). Assuming as be-
with H+
3 ] ≈ [e−], the H2COH+ column density determined in
fore [H+
this study (Nobs
H2COH+ = 6.7 1011 cm−2), and the HCO column
density in L1689B given in Bacmann & Faure (2016) (NHCO =
1.3 1013 cm−2), we ﬁnd again f ∼ 10%, without invoking the
H2CO abundance.

As discussed in Bacmann & Faure (2016), another poten-
tial destruction route for HCO is with abundant atoms such as
H. In this case, assuming an atomic H abundance of ∼ 10−5
with respect to H2, an electronic abundance of 10−8, and kH =
1.5 10−10 cm3s−1 for the rate constant of the reaction HCO + H
(the value at 300 K from Baulch et al. 2005), we ﬁnd a value for
the branching ratio f of 30%. It is however unclear whether the
value of kH taken here also applies at 10 K, since no measure-
ments of this rate constant are available at low temperatures.

One major uncertainty in this determination of the branch-
ing ratio results from possible alternative formation scenar-
ios for HCO, which could be non negligible. One such route
is the neutral-neutral reaction between H2CO and an abun-
dant radical like OH or CN. Recent experimental studies have
conﬁrmed that such reactions could proceed eﬃciently via
tunneling at low temperatures. Indeed, Shannon et al. (2013)
and Gómez Martín et al. (2014) have shown that the reaction
CH3OH + OH gets faster at low temperatures down to ∼ 50 K.
A spectacular increase in the reaction constant is also reported
by Jiménez et al. (2016) for CH3OCHO + OH (the reaction rate
increases by three orders of magnitude between 300 K and 22 K,
and by an order of magnitude between 60 K and 22 K, reaching
as high a value as 1.2 10−10 cm3s−1). In order to be as eﬃcient as
the ion-molecule route to form HCO, the constant of the reaction
between H2CO and OH would have to be 4 10−10 cm3s−1 at 10 K
(Bacmann & Faure 2016). No measurements at 10 K of this re-
action (or similar ones) are available, but are needed, because the
behaviour of the reaction constant is not known below 230 K (at
which temperature it is 10−11 cm3s−1) and extrapolation is haz-
ardous. In the case that H2CO + OH would be a major formation
channel for HCO, the observed HCO abundance could be ac-
counted for without the need for the DR of H2COH+ to yield a
signiﬁcant amount of HCO. In this respect, the branching ratio
we determined above can be considered as an upper limit. 2

This result can have implications for chemical networks
because they assume statistical weights for the three products
CO, HCO and H2CO (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), as in the UMIST12 net-
work or the KIDA3 database (Wakelam et al. 2012), following
Prasad & Huntress (1980). As already noted in Hamberg et al.

2 We also note that he neutral-neutral reaction CH2 + O should yield
negligible amounts of HCO in the conditions prevailing in cold cores
(see KIDA datasheet on this reaction). Using the rate constant in the
KIDA database (2 10−12 cm3s−1) and the steady-state abundances of
CH2 and O from the model of Le Gal et al. (2014), we ﬁnd that this
reaction is 100 times less eﬃcient than the DR of H2COH+ at forming
HCO.

(2007), these branching ratios are still vastly in agreement with
their experimental results which state that CO, HCO and H2CO
represent over 90% of the products. However, the branching ra-
tio that is needed here to account for the observed HCO and
H2COH+ abundances could be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
statistical value, as it could be 10%, or lower.

This value should however be taken with some caution, be-
cause the excitation of H2COH+ is not well constrained in the
absence of collisional coeﬃcients. Our estimation of the branch-
ing ratio should therefore be repeated once collisional coeﬃ-
cients for H2COH+ become available. Observations of H2COH+
in other prestellar sources are also needed to conﬁrm the current
ﬁndings.

To conclude, we report here the detection of protonated
formaldehyde H2COH+ in the prestellar source L1689B. The
derived beam-averaged column density is 6.7 1011 cm−2, corre-
sponding to an abundance of ∼ 1.9 10−11 with respect to H2, if
we assume an H2 column density of 3.6 1022 cm−2 (Roy et al.
2014). This abundance is however likely overestimated, as the
H2 column density in Roy et al. (2014) is averaged over a
36′′ beam, and is probably higher in the 15-19′′ beam of our
H2COH+ observations. The H2COH+ column density agrees
with the destruction rate of H2COH+ by dissociative recombi-
nation as measured by Hamberg et al. (2007), supposing that
H2COH+ is mostly formed by protonation of H2CO in prestellar
cores, and destroyed by electronic dissociative recombination.
Using previous observations of the radical HCO in the same
source, we constrain the branching ratio of H2COH+ to HCO
to be around 10−30%, or lower if HCO is signiﬁcantly formed
by gas-phase reactions between H2CO and a radical. The exper-
imental determination of branching ratios is a fundamental piece
of data in astrochemistry, but in case these measurements are not
available, observations can bring valuable constraints, as demon-
strated here.
