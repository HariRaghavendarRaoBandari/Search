The structure of 70Ge has been studied through in-beam gamma ray spectroscopy. A new band
structure is identiﬁed that leads to forking of the ground-state band into two excited bands. Band
structures have been investigated using the microscopic triaxial projected shell model approach.
The observed forking is demonstrated to result from almost simultaneous band crossing of the two-
neutron aligned and the γ-band built on this two-quasiparticle conﬁguration with the ground-state
band.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The atomic nucleus is a fascinating quantum-many
body system which shows a rich variety of shapes and
structures [1]. Major advances in experimental tech-
niques have facilitated these studies of atomic nuclei
at extremes of isospin, angular-momentum and excita-
tion energy. These investigations have revealed new
structures and phenomena, hitherto, unknown in nu-
clear physics. In nuclear high-spin spectroscopy, band-
structures have been observed up to high angular mo-
mentum in some of the nuclei and investigations of these
high-spin states probe the predicted modiﬁcations of the
shell structure and pairing properties with increasing ro-
tational frequency. In particular, nuclei in the mass range
60 ≤ A ≤ 70 display a wide range of phenomena, for in-
stance, co-existence of oblate and prolate shapes, shape
changes and dramatic variations in band crossing prop-
erties have been observed with particle number.

In most deformed nuclei, the ground-state band is
crossed by a two-quasiparticle aligned structure result-
ing in the well established phenomenon of backbending
[2]. The yrast band after band crossing consists of two-
quasiparticle aligned state and the ground-state conﬁgu-
ration becomes the excited band. In several nuclei this
band referred to as the yrare band, is observed up to
high-spins. Further, in some of the nuclei, the forking
of ground-state band into two two-quasiparticle struc-
tures have also been observed. For example, in even-even
Xe-Ba-Ce nuclei with N=66-76, the ground-state band
forks into two distinct band structures based on h11/2
two-quasiparticle conﬁgurations [3]. Most of these ob-
served bands after forking have been interpreted as two-
neutron and two-proton quasiparticle structures which
align almost simultaneously. The forking in these axially-
symmetric nuclei has been explained [4] as resulting from
repulsive nature of neutron-proton interaction in high-j

intruder orbital h11/2 for the particle-hole conﬁguration.
In the present work, we report a forking of ground state
band in 70Ge. This is shown to arise from a γ−band built
on a two-quasiparticle conﬁguration.

Well developed γ−bands are known to exist in many
transitional nuclei close to the ground-state which have
been investigated using various phenomenological models
[5, 6]. In the framework of microscopic triaxial projected
shell model (TPSM) approach [7], these γ− bands re-
sult from projection of the K=2 state of the triaxial self-
conjugate vacuum conﬁguration. This state is a superpo-
sition of K=0, 2, 4,.... conﬁguration with K=0 projected
state corresponding to ground-state band. The projec-
tions from K=2 and 4 correspond to γ- and γγ- bands,
respectively [8, 9]. It has been demonstrated in several
studies that TPSM approach provides an excellent de-
scription of the observed γ-bands in several mass regions
[8, 9]. It is also obvious from this description that not
only the ground-state band, but also the quasiparticle-
particle excited conﬁgurations should have the associated
γ-bands built on them. The existence of γ-band on each
intrinsic state has been predicted by Bohr and Mottelson
quite sometime back [1].

Low-spin states of 70Ge were previously investigated
through the (p, p′), (n, n′γ), (p,t) and (3He, d) reactions
[10–13]. These studies reported the level structure of
70Ge up to 5.1 MeV excitation energy. Later, high spin
states were studied by two groups [14, 15], identiﬁed the
ground state positive-parity band up to Jπ = (12+) state.
In this article, we have presented the experimental ob-
servation of γ−band structure built on two-quasiparticle
conﬁguration in 70Ge. Experimental details and relevant
results are described in Sec. II. Deduced band structures
are discussed in Sec. III using cranked Hartree Fock Bo-
goliubov model (CHFBM) and triaxial projected shell
model (TPSM) approaches. A brief summary is pre-
sented in Sec. IV.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND RESULTS

High-spin states of 70Ge were populated using fusion-
evaporation reaction 64Ni(12C, α2n)70Ge. A beam of 12C
at 55 MeV energy was delivered by the 15 UD Pelletron
accelerator [16] at Inter University Accelerator Centre,
New Delhi. The target used in this experiment was an
isotopically enriched 64Ni with thickness of ∼ 1.5 mg/cm2
on a 7 mg/cm2 thick Au backing. The de-excitation cas-
cades of γ-rays from residual nuclei were detected us-
ing the Gamma Detector Array (GDA) [17]. The GDA
consisted of 12 Compton suppressed n-type Hyper Pure
Germanium (HPGe) detectors, having 23% eﬃciency rel-
ative to 3” x 3” NaI(Tl) crystal. These detectors were
arranged in three groups, with each group consisted of
four detectors, at angles 50◦, 98◦ and 144◦ with respect
to beam direction. Anti-Compton shields (ACS) made
of Bismuth Germanate (BGO) were used to suppress the
background from Compton scattered events.

The data were recorded using an online CAMAC-based
data acquisition system called Freedom [18] and trigger
was set when at least two detectors were ﬁred in coinci-
dence. A total of more than 13 × 107 twofold or higher
coincidence events were recorded in list mode. About
20% of the recorded events correspond to α2n evapora-
tion channel leading to the nucleus of interest 70Ge. Of-
ﬂine data analysis was carried out using programs RAD-
WARE [19], CANDLE [20] and INGASORT [21]. List-
mode data were sorted into a Eγ- Eγ matrix from which
coincidence spectra were generated with an energy dis-
persion of 0.5 keV/channel. In addition, separate 4k x
4k angle-dependent matrices were constructed by taking
energies of γ-ray transitions from all detectors at 50◦ or
144◦ on one axis and coincidence γ energies from rest of
the detectors at 98◦ on the other axis. These matrices
were used to assign multipolarities of the γ transitions
using the directional correlation of oriented state (DCO)
technique [22]. The experimental DCO ratios for the
present work is deﬁned [23] as

RDCO =

Iγ1 at 50◦ or 144◦ gated by γ2 at 98◦
Iγ1 at 98◦ gated by γ2 at 50◦ or 144◦

(1)

If the gating transition is of stretched quadrupole na-
ture then this ratio is ∼ 1 for pure quadrupole transitions
and 0.5 for pure dipole ones. If the gating transition is of
pure dipole multipolarity then this ratio is between 0 to
2 depending on the mixing ratio, and is 1 for pure dipole
transitions.

The level scheme of 70Ge has been extended up to the
state with Jπ= (20+) and excitation energy 10.2 MeV
based on γ-γ coincidence relationships, intensity argu-
ments and DCO ratio measurements. The partial level
scheme of 70Ge established in the present work, relevant
to the discussion in this article is shown in Fig.1. The
ground state positive-parity band determined from the
present work is shown in Fig.1 as band B1. This band
was known previously up to spin, Jπ = (12+) [12, 15, 24]

and is extended to 14 in the present work with inclu-
sion of 1051 keV γ-ray transition on top of 12+ level.
An example of γ-γ coincidence spectrum gated on 906
keV is shown in Fig. 2 illustrating the transitions in
band B1. The inset of this ﬁgure shows the transitions
in band B1 consistently, common in gates on 1051 and
1474 keV γ-ray transitions. An important observation in
the present work is identiﬁcation of a new band structure
B2 which arises from forking of the ground state band at
6+ state. Such band structures with forking have also
been observed earlier in neighboring nuclei 66−68Ge [25–
28]. The band B2 is extended to 20 with the addition
of ﬁve new γ-transitions of energies 1240, 840, 626, 1178
and 846 keV above the 5538 keV state. Representative
γ − γ coincidence spectra gated on 1134- and 1109-keV,
1134- and 1240-keV γ-rays (generated using the AND
logic in RADWARE [19]) are shown in panels (a) and
(b) of Fig. 3, display the newly identiﬁed transitions in
band B2. The DCO ratios calculated from two asymmet-
ric matrices for all the transitions in band B2 (except 846
keV, which is quite weak) are consistent with stretched
quadrupole nature, and therefore they are placed in the
level scheme as ∆J=2 spin sequence.

The band B3 is extended up to spin 8 by placing a
1067-keV γ transition above 3752-keV state. A 1218 keV
γ-transition decaying from (5+) to 3+ state in band B3
is also conﬁrmed in the present work, consistent with
the placement in Ref [12], whereas this transition was
not reported in recent work [15]. A representative sum
γ − γ coincidence spectrum gated on 667- and 1098-keV
γ-rays is shown in Fig. 4. Parity for energy levels in
bands B1, B2 and B3 are assigned based on earlier works
and from systematics [15, 25, 28]. Details of the γ-ray
energies, measured relative intensities, DCO ratios and
multipolarities of the observed γ-ray transitions of 70Ge
are summarized in Table I.

TABLE I. Transition energy (Eγ ), relative intensity (Iγ ),

of 70Ge, are listed. Relative intensities are calculated with
respect to the 1143-keV transition by normalizing its inten-
sity to a value of 100. ∆J = 2 transitions are used as gating
transitios for DCO ratio measurements. Errors are given in

III. DISCUSSION

Low-spin positive-parity states in 70Ge were inter-
preted by several authors using various theoretical mod-
els [29–31]. In the present work, the observed band struc-
tures and shape evolution are discussed using standard
cranked shell model and triaxial projected shell model
approaches.

A. Cranked Hartree Fock Bogoliubov analysis

Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov cranking calculations have
been performed using the universal parametrization of
the Woods-Saxon potential with short range monopole
pairing [32]. BCS formalism was used to calculate the
pairing gap ∆ for both protons and neutrons. Total
Routhian Surface (TRS) calculations were performed in
the (β2, γ) plane at diﬀerent rotational frequencies and
the total energy was minimized with respect to hexade-
capole deformation (β4). TRS plots for favored positive-
parity states (+, +) are shown in Fig. 5 at rotational fre-
quencies of ω = 0.5 and 0.7 MeV. These indicate that
the nucleus has substantial quadrupole deformation. At

a rotational frequency ω = 0.5 MeV, in the vicinity of
the ﬁrst band crossing, a minimum is seen at (β2, γ)
≈ (0.27, -15◦), indicating that the nuclear shape is tri-
axial, but approaching prolate (γ=0◦). At even higher
rotational frequency (ω = 0.7 MeV), the TRS predict a
fairly well-deﬁned minimum with γ ≈ +12◦ and approx-
imately the same quadrupole deformation. The energy
minimum moves towards increasingly positive values of
γ at higher rotational frequencies, indicating loss of col-
lectivity. To investigate the nature of observed bands and
crossing frequencies, the quasiparticle routhians were cal-
culated for β2 ≈ 0.27, γ ≈ -15◦ as a function of rotational
frequency [33] and are depicted in Fig. 6. The neutron
crossing is predicted at a considerably lower rotational
frequency (ω = 0.5 MeV), while the proton crossing is
expected at a much higher frequency, ω = 0.75 MeV.

Cranking formalism [34] has been applied to extract
the experimental alignments (ix) as a function of rota-
tional frequency (ω). Figure 7 shows the alignment plot
for bands B1 and B2 in 70Ge. The observed alignment at
ω ≈ 0.50 MeV for band B1, shown in Fig.7, is attributed
to g2
9/2 neutron alignment, consistent with predictions in
previous work [12, 15, 24]. In comparison to neighboring

isotopes, the observed crossing in band B1 of 70Ge occurs
slightly earlier (by ≈ 0.16 MeV) than the observed align-
ments in 66−68Ge [25, 28]. This might be attributed to
the shape change in 66−70Ge due to large shell gaps exist-
ing at N = 34 and 36 and 38 in the Nilsson single particle
level diagram. The newly identiﬁed positive-parity band
B2 having band head spin, I = 8 also exhibits band

7b) with moderate band interaction above the 6+ state
which is similar to the one observed in yrast band B1.
The proton band crossing is ruled out as that is expected
at ≈ 0.75 MeV from the cranked shell model analysis.
Thus the observed band crossings in both the bands, B1
and B2 are attributed to g9/2 neutrons. The second align-
ment is also observed in band B2 above spin 14+ which
might be composed of four quasiparticle structure. As is
evident from Fig. 7 that the observed alignments in both
bands B1 and B2 are consistent with the TPSM results
which are discussed in the following section.

with the last term in (2) being the quadrupole-pairing
force. Interaction strengths of the model Hamiltonian are
chosen as follows: QQ-force strength χ is adjusted such
that the physical quadrupole deformation ǫ is obtained
as a result of self-consistent mean-ﬁeld HFB calculation
[35]. Monopole pairing strength GM is of the standard

In the present calculation, we use G1 = 20.82 and

served odd-even mass diﬀerences in this region [36–38].

FIG. 10.
(Color online) Comparison of calculated energies
with observed experimental level energies subtracted from ref-
erence value displayed as a function of spin for the band B1,
B2 and ground-state band (g-band) in 70Ge.

The oscillator model space considered in the present work
is N = 3, 4 and 5 for both neutrons and protons. The
quadrupole pairing strength GQ is assumed to be pro-
portional to GM and the proportionality constant ﬁxed
to 0.18. These interaction strengths are consistent with
those used earlier for the same mass region [8]. Intrinsic
quasiparticle states have been constructed for 70Ge with
the deformation parameters of ǫ = 0.235 and ǫ′ = 0.145
[8].

The projected states from various intrinsic states close
to the Fermi surface are displayed in Fig. 8. The ground-
state, γ- and γγ-bands labeled by (0, 0), (2, 0) and (4, 0)
result from angular-momentum projection of the vac-
uum conﬁguration by specifying K=0, 2 and 4 respec-
tively in the rotational D-matrix [40].
It is noted that
γ- and γγ-bands depict a substantial signature splitting
and even-spin states of the γ-band are close in energy to
the ground-state band.

What is most interesting to observe from Fig. 8 is
the crossing of K =1 two neutron-aligned conﬁguration
(1, 2n) with the ground-state band at spin, I=6. Fur-
ther the γ-band built on this conﬁguration with K =3
also crosses the ground-state band between I=6 and 8.
These aligning states result from the projection of the
same intrinsic state but having diﬀerent K-values. Since
K=3 two-neutron aligned γ-band has lower signature
splitting as compared to the parent band, the lowest odd-
spin members along the yrast-band shall originate from
this conﬁguration. The proton-aligned conﬁgurations,
(1, 2p) and (3, 2p) lie at higher excitation energies and
do not cross the ground-state band. However, the two-
neutron plus two-proton aligned conﬁgurations crosses
the two-neutron aligned conﬁguration above I=14 and

the yrast-band above this spin value is composed of four-
quasiparticle states.

Projected states shown in Fig. 8 and many more states
around the Fermi surface (∼ 40 in number ) are then
employed to diagonalize the shell model Hamiltonian,
Eq. (2). Energies obtained after diagonalization are com-
pared with the experimental data in Fig. 9. It is evident
from the ﬁgure that the experiential data is reproduced
reasonably well by TPSM calculations. This can seen
more clearly in Fig. 10 where experimental data are com-
pared with TPSM calculations for ground-state, B1 and
B2 bands after subtracting the level energies from refer-
ence value. The experimental level energies degenerate
with TPSM results up to highest observed spin in band
B1.
In case of band B2, level energies are almost de-
generate up to spin 14 and then deviate at higher spin.
This could be due to shape changes at higher spins as
predicted by the TRS study presented in Sec. III A.

Further, to probe the structure of high-spin states
shown in Fig. 9 after band mixing, dominant compo-
nents of projected wavefunctions of the states are dis-
played in Fig. 11. The ground-state band up to spin,
I= 4 has predominately 0-quasiparticle conﬁguration
with K=0 as is evident from the panel (a) of Fig. 11.
The spin state with I=6 has substantial contribution
from the two-quasiparticle neutron conﬁguration having
K=1. The amplitudes of the wavefunctions of two aligned

bands observed above ground-state band are shown in
panels (b) and (c). These are noted to be dominated by
K=1 two-neutron aligned conﬁguration (1, 2n) and the
γ-band built on this aligned state with K=3 for angular-
momentum states of I=8, 10, 12 and 14. For high-spin
states of I=16 and above, the wavefunctions are mostly
composed of four-quasiparticle states.

C. Comparison with band structures in 68Ge

The nature of observed quasiparticle alignments and
band structures in 70Ge is quite similar to its neighboring
isotope 68Ge [26–28], in which the ground state band
forks beyond I = 8+ into multiple band structures.

To have an insight of the nature of observed align-
ments and forking band structures in 68Ge, we have per-
formed the TPSM calculations for 68Ge with deforma-
tion parameters of ǫ = 0.22 and ǫ′ = 0.16. The predicted
TPSM band structures after band mixing are compared
with experimental data in Fig. 12.
It is evident from
the ﬁgure that the four observed bands, B1 to B4 above
ground state band are reproduced quite well by TPSM
approach. Figure 13 shows the comparison of observed
alignments with TPSM calculations as a function of ro-
tational frequency for the bands B1, B2 and B3, indicat-
ing that all three bands have sharp band crossings and
are composed of two-quasiparticle structures after the
bandcrossing. Further, from the analysis of the TPSM
wavefunctions, it is seen that these three bands B1, B2
and B3 have dominant structure of two-neutron aligned
band with K=1, γ-band built on this aligned conﬁgura-
tion having K=3 and two-proton aligned band with K=1
respectively. The odd-spin band has dominant contri-
bution from γ-band built on the neutron-aligned band
with K=3. Therefore, the two even-spin aligned band
structures are predicted to have same neutron conﬁgu-
ration and the third one has proton structure. In pre-

(Color online) Comparison of experimental and

vious work, these three even-spin bands B1, B2 and B3
have been interpreted [27, 28] as two two-neutron aligned
bands and the conﬁguration of the third band remained
unresolved. The g-factor measurements of the states in
70Ge and 68Ge are highly desirable to probe further the
predicted intrinsic structures of observed bands.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In summary, a new positive-parity band has been iden-
tiﬁed in 70Ge through γ-ray spectroscopic study which
extended the level scheme up to (20) and excitation en-
ergy of 10.2 MeV. The intensity of the ground state band
forks into two branches above 6+ state, resulting into
two positive-parity band structures. It has been demon-
strated using CSM and TPSM approaches that both the
observed band structures have two-neutron aligned con-
ﬁgurations. The possibility of proton structure is ruled
out as in CSM study it occurs at ω = 0.75 MeV and in
both the bands the crossing is observed at ω ≈ 0.5 MeV.
From the TPSM wavefunctions, it is noted that band B1
is based on two-neutron quasiparticle conﬁguration hav-
ing K=1 and band B2 is predicted to be a γ-band built on
this aligned two-quasiparticle band with K=3. The fork-
ing of the ground-state band into two bands in 70Ge has,
therefore, a diﬀerent origin as compared to the earlier ob-
served forking in nuclei. Further, it has been shown that
one of the observed bands in 68Ge also has the structure
of the γ-band built on the two-quasipaticle conﬁguration,
indicating that this kind of two-quasiparticle band struc-
tures may be more widespread and need to be explored
in other nuclei and mass regions of the periodic table.
