Abstract

Magnetization of soft-ferromagnetic nano- and microtubes of nanometer-thin walls (a single-widening rolled-up nanomem-
branes) is theoretically studied using analytical and numerical approaches including diﬀerent stress-induced anisotropies.
Within the analytical study, we consider magnetostatic eﬀects qualitatively, with an eﬀective anisotropy, while they are
fully treated in the micromagnetic simulations (limited to the tubes of submicrometer diameters however). Basic types
of the periodic ordering have been established and their presence in nanotubes of polycrystalline Permalloy and cobalt
has been veriﬁed within the simulations. The domain structure is basically determined by a material-deposition-induced
helical stress or a cooling-induced axial stress via the volume magnetostriction while it is inﬂuenced by the distribution
of magnetic charges as well. Also, it is dependent on the initial state of the magnetization process.

1. Introduction

Ordering in a small ferromagnetic tube with very thin
wall compared to its radius is diﬃcult to anticipate since
that structure shares features of the thin ﬁlm and magnetic
wire relevant to the magnetostatics (a radial anisotropy of
the hard-axis type and easy long axis of the tube) with a
strong stress-driven anisotropy dependent on fabrication
conditions. Because of complexity of the anisotropy, there
are many metastable states of the magnetization, thus,
the ordering is sensitive to initial conditions and external
factors. On the other hand, the tube is a very impor-
tant geometry among magnetic nano- and micro-systems
since tubular coverings enable modiﬁcations of magneto-
transport; GMI eﬀect, and magneto-optical properties of
wires and ﬁbers to be utilized for sensing applications
[1, 2, 3]. Also, magnetic microtube can serve as a sens-
ing pipe for magnetic nanoﬂuids [4].

Techniques of manufacturing single-crystalline and poly-
crystalline micro- and nanotubes of magnetic materials
include electrochemical and chemical routes [2, 5, 6, 7].
Highly eﬃcient production methods are developed for mag-
netic microtubes of a thin wall. They are produced with
sputtering in the form of microwire or microﬁber coverings
or rolled-up membranes of nanometer thicknesses [8, 9].
Note that an outer shell of the amorphous glass-coated
magnetic microwire can be considered as a tube as well,
albeit it strongly interacts with the inner core of the wire,
(the glass-coated magnetic microwire is a single-phase sys-
tem with core-shell type magnetic ordering [10]), and its

wall is quite thick relative to the wire radius [11, 12]. How-
ever, upon glass removal, the outer shell becomes very thin
while the thickness of a domain wall (DW) separating it
from the inner core increases [13, 14]. This is accompanied
by a reorganization of the domain structure and inﬂuences
the GMI characteristics [15]. With regard to functional-
ized wires and ﬁbers, there is a need for modeling the
dynamics of the thin-wall tube magnetization. The ﬁrst
step to do in order to formulate an eﬀective model is to
understand dominant mechanisms responsible for ordering
in the nano- and micro-tubes without external inﬂuences.
In microtubes of very small wall-thickness to radius
ratio, the longitudinal easy-axis anisotropy of the magne-
tostatic origin is weaker than in tubes of a thick wall or
in wires. Thus, inﬂuenced by the stress-driven anisotropy,
the domain magnetization can strongly deviate from the
long-axis direction even in very elongated systems. More-
over, the magnetostatically-induced hard-axis anisotropy
(the hard axis is normal to the tube surface) is strong,
which facilitates in-the-wall ordering (excluding singulari-
ties; vortex and antivortex cores) independent of the stress
direction and sign of the volume magnetostriction. De-
spite the shape anisotropy is not well deﬁned in the system
with an inhomogeneous magnetization, any eﬃcient ana-
lytical approach to establishing equilibrium states of the
tube requires introducing such an eﬀective anisotropy into
the model. Full micromagnetic simulations are necessary
to verify the validity of such a simpliﬁcation to the nan-
otubes while they are not any eﬃcient alternative to the
analytical evaluations of the microtube characteristics at
present. It is because, simulating microtubes requires too
large computational resources.

The purpose of the present study is to identify basic
equilibrium states of thin-wall microtubes and nanotubes
including longitudinal, transverse, and helical anisotropies.
We compare static analytical and numerical solutions to
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for nanotubes, mod-
eling the magnetostatics eﬀect with an eﬀective anisotropy
or performing full micromagnetic calculations, respectively.
The evaluations are focused on the polycrystalline tubes
of the most popular magnetic materials; Co and Py tubes.
When exclude the crystalline anisotropy eﬀect, important
diﬀerences in ordering of these two materials follow from
diﬀerent saturation magnetizations. The inﬂuence of other
factors (origin of the internal stress, initial state of the
magnetization) on the formation of the magnetic texture
is discussed as well.

In section II, a model of the thin-wall nano- and mi-
crotube is formulated, its analytical solutions are pointed
out. Section III is devoted to presenting results of mi-
cromagnetic simulations of the process of tube ordering.
Conclusions are collected in section IV.

of a polycrystalline or amorphous tube, the LLG equation

Here, ˆi ≡ [1, 0, 0], (the wire is directed along the x axis),
M = |m| represents the saturation magnetization, J de-
notes the exchange constant, (J ≡ 2γAex/M ; Aex is called
an exchange stiﬀness while γ a gyromagnetic factor), β1,
β2, and β3 determine the strength of eﬀective axial, radial,
and circumferential anisotropies, respectively. An addi-
tional anisotropy in the tube wall is included with the β4
constant. In the relevant term of the torque, a is a com-

bination of ˆi and (0,−z, y)/(cid:112)y2 + z2 vectors and |a| = 1.

In order to establish main contributions to the anisotropy

constants, utilizing analogies to the tubes, we adapt ele-
ments of the theory of elasticity of the amorphous and
polycrystalline glass-coated microwires which is well de-
veloped [10]. According to this theory, the internal stress
can be created at two production stages; the solidiﬁcation
of the magnetic material and its cooling that is a much
slower process. The solidiﬁcation of a magnetic microwire
develops in the radial direction. In the surface layer of the
microwire that can be considered as a tube, it produces
equal to each other axial and circumferential components
of the stress while the relevant radial stress is negligibly

2

small. This kind of stress follows from a homogeneous
shrinking of the inside surface of the tube compared to
the outside surface and we call it a ”solidiﬁcation stress”,
(in the body of the ”rapidly-solidiﬁed” wire, the relevant
stress is created layer by layer). In the presence of that
stress, in the tubes made of amorphous or polycrystalline
materials, the magnetostriction that is of the volume type
only (isotropic) is expected to equally contribute to the β1
and β3 constants of the anisotropy.

However, the tube manufacturing is a diﬀerent pro-
cess from the wire production in general. Typically, the
magnetic tubes are formed via rolling-up planar magnetic
(created with sputtering or evaporation) layers or via di-
rect sputtering on a surface of cylindrical wires. Those
methods of the material deposition are accompanied by
another ”solidiﬁcation stress” and a resulting easy direc-
tion in the magnetic layer that is parallel or perpendicu-
lar to the sputtering (evaporation) plane usually. While
the rapid-solidiﬁcation stress is not expected to be strong
in a very thin ﬁlm, the directed sputtering can result in
the creation of a signiﬁcant anisotropy relevant to β4 con-
stant [16, 17]. Note that such an anisotropy can be weak-
ened or completely removed via annealing. That ”helical”
anisotropy in a magnetic tube has been modeled previously
in [18].

Another type of the stress can dominate in multi-layered
tubes. Since the thermal expansion is isotropic within
the cross-section of the double-layer tube, for a suﬃciently
long tube, a diﬀerence in the thermal expansion coeﬃcients
of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers results in equal
to each other radial and circumferential stresses as well
as in a much higher axial stress which are induced during
the slow cooling process. Therefore, in the amorphous or
polycrystalline tubes, the ”cooling stress” contributions to
the constants of the radial and circumferential anisotropies
are equal.

evaluations. Thus, we consider a quasi-2D system with a

etry.

2.1. Tubes with cooling-dominated stress

According to the above analysis of the anisotropy con-

stants, the cooling-dominated stress produces an axial anisotropy
mainly. Therefore, having in mind the aim of obtaining
the periodic along the tube axis solutions, ﬁrst, we seek
for single-DW solutions assuming the domains to be mag-
netized longitudinally to the wire. Thus, the boundary
condition lim|x|→∞m = ±(M, 0, 0) is satisﬁed. Using a
systematic approach of the soliton theory, we look for the
equations of motion in the multi-linear form. Following

where Ka ≡ [β1 + (β2 − β3)/2]/γ. This case corresponds
to the uniaxial eﬀective anisotropy whose axis is oriented
along the tube, while the DW solutions are similar to ones
studied in the context of relatively-thick (submicrometer)
ferromagnetic layers [20, 21]. In our eﬀective description
of the thin-wall tube, via assuming the domain magneti-
zation to be oriented in the tube surface, the magneto-
static contributions to the anisotropy coeﬃcient βms
are
removed, thus, βms
i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3. Hence, with the
condition β2 + β3 = 0, we consider the anisotropy due
to the cooling-dominated stress in the tube. The condi-
tions of periodicity q

where l is integer. The explicit form of the magnetiza-

Having found the above single-DW solutions, we mod-
ify them when looking for the patterned (multi-domain)
periodic textures. We ﬁnd novel magnetization structures
just via changing speciﬁc hyperbolic functions sech(u), tanh(u)
in (6) into the Jacobi elliptic functions; cn(u, s2), sn(u, s2),
s2 ∈ [0, 1). This often utilized method of ﬁnding peri-
odic solutions from soliton solutions is based on common
properties of the corresponding pairs of the hyperbolic and
elliptic Jacobi functions.
In particular, describing static
DWs with the LLG equation, similarity of the relation
sech(u)d2tanh(u)/du2 − tanh(u)d2sech(u)/du2
= −sech(u)tanh(u)
cn(u, s2)d2sn(u, s2)/du2
− sn(u, s2)d2cn(u, s2)/du2 = −s2cn(u, s2)sn(u, s2) allows
for an easy veriﬁcation of the validity of our method. In-
serting this way modiﬁed magnetization ﬁeld into (1), one
ﬁnds the parameters of the periodic solutions to must sat-
isfy similar conditions to (5). Two of the basic types of
such solutions are distinguished by the orientation of the
DWs parallel to the domain magnetization. Such an ori-
entation of the DW relative to the domains is preferred by
the condition of compensation of the positive and negative
magnetic volume charges −∇ · m, [17].

= β(solid)

According to previous section considerations, in the
thin-wall tube, the solidiﬁcation contribution to the con-
stant of the circumferential anisotropy is equal to that of
the axial anisotropy; β(solid)
, and the contribu-
tion to the radial anisotropy constant β(solid)
is equal to
zero. However, such a two-axis anisotropy is equivalent to
the radial anisotropy whose type (easy-axis or hard-axis)
is determined by the sign of the magnetostriction con-
stant. Thus, the consequence of the solidiﬁcation stress is
the enhancement or attenuation of the magnetostatically-
induced radial anisotropy of the hard-axis type. Provided
the summary radial hard-axis anisotropy is suﬃciently strong,
the eﬃcient way to describe the magnetic ordering is ap-
plying the XY model on the curved surface (the tube sur-
face) spanned on the axial (X) and circumferential (Y) di-
rections. Detailed justiﬁcation of that approach to the or-
dering in thin soft-ferromagnetic ﬁlm has been given else-
where [22]. We write the magnetization in the cylindrical
coordinates and assume mρ = 0 and mx + imϕ = M ei(η+θ)
with η = const. Insertion of the above magnetization into

the direction of the domain magnetization, the angle η,
similar to the description of DWs in soft-magnetic nanos-
tripes [22, 23]. However, unlike in the nanostripes whose
edges strongly aﬀect the DW texture (via stabilizing sin-
gularities; antivortices), in the case of the inﬁnite planar
layers or tube walls, the (anti)vortex containing DWs are
not preferable for suﬃciently thin systems while Neel DWs
are [20, 24]. Those DWs are not described with the XY
model.

the XY model, the present DW does not contain vortices
nor antivortices, which provides basic distinction between
the multi-domain textures relevant to diﬀerent regimes of
the description of the tubes with solidiﬁcation-dominated
stress.

3. Micromagnetic simulations

We have performed a series of micromagnetic simu-
lations of the relaxation of thin-wall ferromagnetic tubes
in order to verify the analytically obtained magnetiza-
tion distributions. Simulating the tubes with the cooling-
dominated stress, we apply the material parameters of
cobalt. In [25], the cooling stress has been directly shown
to can signiﬁcantly overcome the solidiﬁcation stress in the
rolled-up Co nanomembrane, which results in qualitative
changes in the hysteresis loops of the tubes with tempera-
ture. Dealing with the solidiﬁcation-dominated stress, we
include the parameters of Permalloy additionally, in or-
der to examine systems of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ratio of
the magnetostatic exchange length lms to the exchange
length of the stress-induced (helical) anisotropy lK. No-
tice that the magnetostatic exchange lengths of Co and
Py are the same (lms = 5.2nm) while their exchange stiﬀ-
nesses Aex are very diﬀerent. The techniques of rolling-up
the nanomembranes of these magnetic materials are well
developed [25, 26], so as related nickel nanomembranes
[9, 27, 28].

Due to the computational complexity, the diameters
of the simulated structures are limited to submicrometer
sizes. We applied OOMMF package [29]. The discretiza-
tion size of the tube grid is 5nm in the YZ plane and
10nm in the X direction. The Gilbert damping constant
is α = 0.5.

3.1. Tubes with cooling-dominated stress

In the simulations of the Co tubes, the following mate-
rial constants are used; the saturation magnetization M =
1.4 · 106A/m, the exchange stiﬀness Aex = 3.3 · 10−11J/m.

of the anisotropy constant to Ka ∼ (−1) · 104J/m3, (thus,
in the change of the easy-axis into the hard-axis). De-
creasing the tube diameter down to several hundreds of
nanometers, the absolute value of the density of energy of
the stress-driven anisotropy is expected to increase. The
Co tubes of 300nm diameter, 20nm wall thickness and 3µm
length, and of the arbitrarily chosen anisotropy constant

ture of Fig. 1b, while the perpendicular magnetization
m(t = 0) = [0, M, 0] evolved to that of Fig. 2. One sees
that there are many stable (metastable) states of the tube
magnetization which realize under speciﬁc initial condi-
tions. They correspond to diﬀerent stationary solutions to
the LLG equation.

In particular; Fig. 1a corresponds to a ﬁeld state (8)
2πR/s = ±K(s), φ = π/2
with w = 0, k
that is plotted in Fig. 4a. Hence, the magnetization is
pointed in the XZ plane. The texture in Fig. 4a is found
via matching solutions of positive and negative q
on the
lines ϕ = 0 and ϕ = π.
The texture of circumferentially magnetized domains
(cid:48)(cid:48)|R = 1, s2 ≈ 1,
in Figs. 1b corresponds to (7) with |q
φ = π/2 (plotted in Fig. 4b). Besides the vicinities of
the wire ends, the domains of Fig. 2 are similar to those
of Fig. 4c. The plot of Fig 4c has been obtained similar
to that of Fig. 4b while taking |q
(cid:48)(cid:48)|R = 5. The cen-
ters of vortices and antivortices which are contained in the
structure of the DWs lie on the lines ϕ = nπ/4, where
n = 0, 1, . . . , 7. From Fig. 4c the relevant DWs are seen to
be of the cross-tie type similar to the DWs of Fig. 2. Note
that a denser bamboo-like domain structure has been es-
tablished within simulations of a similar to ours nanotube
of a ferromagnet with considerably larger magnetostatic
exchange length than that of Co [30]. We mention that
microscopic mechanism responsible for appearance of the
hard-axis anisotropy (positive axial stress), thus, for cre-
ation of the bamboo-like textures in glass-coated wires of
the materials with negative magnetostriction is not com-
pletely clear to date [18], however, it is known to be ac-
tivated during the cooling process. In the thin-wall tubes
(rolled-up nanomembranes) it seems to be especially eﬃ-
cient because of smaller solidiﬁcation stresses than in the
wires. A general model of a similar DW to that of Fig. 1b
while including eﬀects of ﬁnite thickness of the tube wall

([31]) has been formulated in [32]. A cross-tie DW similar
to those in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4c has been simulated in [33].
In Fig. 3, the relaxed magnetization of the tube of
450nm diameter, 20nm wall thickness and 3µm length,
and initially magnetized perpendicular to the long axis
(m(t = 0) = [0, M, 0]) is visualized. Without detailed es-
timation of the stress, we include the arbitrary value of
the constant of the solidiﬁcation-stress induced anisotropy
= −0.63 · 105J/m3 that is reduced compared to
K (cool)
that applied in the simulations of the tubes of 300nm di-
ameter. The reduction in the stress due to the reduction
of the tube-surface curvature is expected and it results in a
decrease of the eﬀective anisotropy constant. The texture
is found to contain vortices and antivortices whose centers
are magnetized along the axis of the initial magnetization
of the tube.

The texture from Fig. 3 can be quite well described lo-
cally with the static solution (8) to the LLG equation. In
the sections of the tube; 0 < ϕ < π/2 and π < ϕ < 3π/2

to the anisotropy constant oversizes the magnetostrictive
contribution leading to the easy-axis.
In the remaining
(vortex-containing) sections of the tube (which correspond
to sections 1 and 3 in Fig. 3), there are no well-deﬁned do-
mains, thus, there is no easy direction of the magnetization
in the plane of the tube surface. There, the magnetostatic
(shape) contribution to the the anisotropy constant has
(cid:48)2 ≈

3.2. Tubes with solidiﬁcation-dominated stress

The tubes of Py have been simulated with the follow-
ing material constants: M = 0.86 · 106A/m, Aex = 1.3 ·
10−11J/m. In the regime of the solidiﬁcation-dominated
stress, visible eﬀects are expected to result from speciﬁc
orientations of the easy direction in the tube wall. This
anisotropy is induced by the material deposition at the
stage of the production of the magnetic layer. We simu-
late the Py tube with a resulting helical anisotropy whose
axis is deviated by π/4 angle from the long axis of the

stripe in the tube wall (directed along [(cid:112)y2 + z2,−z, y]

vector). If this anisotropy is suﬃciently strong, it drives
the spiral orientation of the magnetization inside the do-
mains. Consider a constant the helical anisotropy in the
∼ (−1) · 104 ÷ (−1) · 105J/m3. Notice that
range K (solid)
in-the-plane anisotropy of the constant close to 104J/m3
has been reported for ﬂat and rolled-up nanomembranes
of Py [9], and for Co ﬁlm [16].

and structural anisotropy creates a ’frustration’ of the mag-
netic moments. They orient along the tube axis at some
parts of the tube while, at other parts, they tend to point
onto the spiral line. In consequence, there are no well sep-
arated (by DWs) ferromagnetic domains in the texture of
Fig. 5a.

The next two visualizations (Figs. 5b, 5c) represent
the static ordering of the Py tube of 450nm diameter,
= −1.0 ·
20nm wall thickness, 1µm length and of K (solid)
105J/m3.
Its longitudinal (shape) anisotropy is reduced
compared to the structure of Fig. 5a due to the small
length of the system and the ordering is dominated by
the material anisotropy. The well deﬁned domains of spi-
ral ordering are shown to be separated by DWs which are
parallel to the domain magnetization. Similar to the sim-
ulations of the tubes with cooling-dominated stress, the
ﬁnal state of the magnetization relaxation is dependent on
the initial state. For instance, in Figs. 5b and 5c, the sta-
√
ble textures obtained with the homogeneous initial states
2, 0],
m(t = 0) = [0, M, 0] and m(t = 0) = [M/
respectively, are presented. The stabilized textures diﬀer
not only in the position of the DWs, while also in the DW
structure.

2, M/

√

The ordering in Fig. 5b coincides with the analytically
predicted DW textures for the XY model. The relevant
DW-containing texture described with (10) for |η| = π/4 is
plotted in Fig 6a. Such a DW contains alternating vortices
and antivortices whose polarity is not determined by the
model. In the inset of Fig. 5b, one sees the polarities of
all singularities of the DW to can be of the same polarity.
This is not obtainable from direct cross-tie-DW solutions
to the LLG equation of the one-axis ferromagnet in 2D
[20, 21]. In contrast, the DWs in Fig. 5c, are not of the
cross-tie structure.

In Fig. 6b, the result of the simulation of the cobalt
tube of the same sizes as the tube in Fig. 5b with similar
initial condition m(t = 0) = [0, M, 0] is presented. In the
Co tube, very diﬀerent (Neel-like) DWs from (cross-tie)
DWs of the Py tube are found because of bigger exchange
length of the helical anisotropy lK for Co (lK = 18, 2nm)
than for Py (lK = 11, 4nm). This shows the inapplicability
of the XY model to the Co tube contrary to the Py tube.
Noticeably, the applicability of the XY model is dependent
on the initial conditions as well, which follows from the
diﬀerence in the DW structures in Fig. 5b and Fig. 5c.

4. Conclusions

A series of analytical static solutions to LLG equation
for an eﬀective model of the ferromagnetic thin-wall tube
has been found analyzing diﬀerent parameter regimes. The
applicability of the solutions of our model (that is based
on the substitution of the magnetostatic ﬁeld in the tube
with a contribution to an eﬀective anisotropy ﬁeld) has
been veriﬁed using the micromagnetic simulations.
In-
cluding one of two (axial or helical) types of the eﬀective

anisotropy, the model appeared to be capable to describe
basic features of the ordering in ferromagnetic thin-wall
tubes.

It has been established that main characteristics of the
magnetic textures (the number, size, and shape of the
domains) are governed by the stress-induced anisotropy.
Since the stress in the tube is sensitive to details of the
tube fabrication, the ordering is not universal result of
the material and size parameters. Moreover, a strong de-
pendence of the ordering on initial state of the structure
formation process is noticed.
In spite of this, there is a
quite limited basis of possible magnetization textures of
the tube and factors inﬂuencing their choice are identiﬁed.
Details of textures (the structure of the DWs) are de-
pendent on the ratio of the magnetostatic exchange length
to the exchange length of the stress-driven anisotropy. This
makes a problem for eﬃciently simulating tubes (rolled-
up nanomembranes) of the sub-µm- and µm-radii due to
large computational resources needed when including the
magnetostatic (dipole) interactions. To date, in order to
avoid this problem, any approach to the micromagnetic
simulations of such systems of a large-number of the mag-
netic moments is based on oversizing the length of the
grid discretization over the magnetostatic exchange length
[34, 35]. This can result in overseeing some texture details.
Our analytical model enables inclusion of them into the
tube description.

Finally, we mention that we have not considered nano-
nor microtubes (rolled-up nanomembranes) with perpen-
dicular magnetic anisotropy. In those hard-magnetic sys-
tems a dense structure of radially magnetized domains is
spontaneously created, e.g. in rolled-up Co/Pt and Co/Pd
layers [36, 37]. It is similar to that observed in the outer
shell of the amorphous or polycrystalline glass-coated mi-
crowires with positive magnetostriction constant as a re-
sult of the competition between the stress-driven radial
easy-axis anisotropy and the surface (magnetostatically-
induced) radial anisotropy of the hard-axis type [10, 38].
Since the layers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
are ultra-thin, 3D micromagnetic simulations of those tubes
are challenging, (they require the grid discretization with
very small cells), even for nanometer-sized radii of the
tubes. On the other hand, unlike in the microwires with
positive magnetostriction, the surfaces of the DWs in such
tubes are extremely small, thus, pinning of them to struc-
ture defects is very strong. This makes the magnetic or-
dering irregular (spatially aperiodic) while dominated by
structural properties.
