RATIONAL CURVES IN CICY’S IN PRODUCTS OF TWO

PROJECTIVE SPACES

FILIPPO F. FAVALE

Abstract. Let X be the product of two projective spaces and consider the
general CICY threefold Y in X with conﬁguration matrix A. We prove the
ﬁniteness part of the analogue of the Clemens’ conjecture for such a CICY in
low bidegrees. More precisely, we prove that the number of smooth rational
curves on Y with low bidegree and with nondegenerate birational projection is
at most ﬁnite (even in cases in which positive dimensional families of degenerate
rational curves are known).

Introduction

The Clemens’ conjecture ([Cle84]) states that the generic quintic threefold contains
a ﬁnite number of smooth rational curves of degree d. One of the ﬁrst successful
approach to the proof of this conjecture was done by S. Katz, who proved a
stronger version of the conjecture for degree d ≤ 7, namely

Conjecture 1 ([Kat86]). The scheme of smooth rational curves of degree d on
the general quintic threefold is not empty, reduced and ﬁnite.

In [Nij95],[JK96], following the main idea of its proof, the authors were able to
prove the conjecture in its stronger form for d ≤ 9. Recently this has been im-
proved: the conjecture is true for d ≤ 11 ([Cot12]). The approach of Katz is,
roughly speaking, as follows. First, one constructs the space Md of smooth ratio-
nal curves in P4 of degree d forgetting about the quintic threefold. After that one
takes the moduli space P of smooth Calabi-Yau threefold in P4 and the incidence
correspondence Jd, i.e., all pairs (C, Y ) ∈ Md × P such that C ⊂ Y with the two
projections on Md and P. Then, the conjecture holds for d if Jd is irreducible of
dimension equal to the dimension of P and if there exists a curve of degree d on
the generic quintic threefold. The main ingredient in order to prove the ﬁniteness
of the space of curves on the generic quintic threefold are the results about the
6−regularity ([Mum66]) for curves of low degree proven in [GLP83].

With the same idea in mind, one can ask if the same result is true for other families
of Calabi-Yau varieties. For example, consider the families of Calabi-Yau three-
folds which are complete intersections in some projective space as done in [JK03].

The work follows again the same idea: one deﬁnes an incidence correspondence
and answers positively to the ﬁniteness and existence conditions if the degree of
the curves is low. The meaning of ‘low’ has to be clariﬁed: one investigates the
case where the Calabi-Yau are nondegenerate complete intersections in PN and
obtains 5 families (respectively one in P4 - the quintic threefold - two in P5, two in
P6 and only one in P7). In [JK03] the authors prove that the generalized Clemens’
conjecture holds respectively for d ≤ 7, d ≤ 6 and d ≤ 5 if one considers non
degenerate complete intersections in P5, P6 and P7. Other interesting results on
this subject can be found in [Knu12] and [Knu13].

In order to approach the conjecture for a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds in an
ambient space X, one has two main objectives: the existence of a curve of the right
“degree” on the general Calabi-Yau threefold Y on the family and the ﬁniteness of
such curves in Y .

In this paper we investigate the ﬁniteness problem for families of Complete In-
tersection Calabi-Yau (CICY in short) in the product X of two projective spaces
Pa1 and Pa2. To approach this case we need a result of regularity similar to the
one proven in [GLP83] which is known for curves in the product of two projective
spaces ([Loz09]). The Theorem in [Loz09] holds only when ai ≥ 2 and only for
curves which have a nondegenerate birational projection on the two factors of X.
For this reason, instead of using the space Md1,d2 of smooth rational curves of
bidegree (d1, d2) in X, we use the subspace M′
d1,d2 of curves which have a non-
degenerate birational projection on both the factors and the associated incidence
correspondence J ′
d1,d2. To each general CICY Y in X we can associate a conﬁgura-
tion matrix A, a 2 by m matrix (m is the codimension of Y in X) whose columns
are the bidegrees of the hypersurfaces that cut Y . Our main result is Theorem 5
whose results are the analogue of the ﬁniteness results in [Kat86], [Nij95], [JK96],
and [JK03]. It can be stated as follows:

Theorem. Let X = Pa1 × Pa2 and let A be a matrix conﬁguration of a nondegen-
erate CICY in X. Let us deﬁne
(1)

WA = {(d1, d2) | ai ≤ di}

ZA =(cid:26)

(d1, d2) | ∀j = 1, . . . , m ∃ u, v with u + v = 1 such that

a1 ≤ d1 ≤ a1 + b2j − 1 + v

and

a2 ≤ d2 ≤ a2 + b1j − 1 + u (cid:27) .

Then the following hold:

• the set ZA is not empty;
• If (d1, d2) 6∈ WA, then M′
• If (d1, d2) ∈ ZA, then J ′

d1,d2 is empty;
d1,d2 is irreducible and the generic CICY in UA

contains at most a ﬁnite number of elements of M′

d1,d2.

One might wonder if it is possible to work with Md1,d2 instead of M′
d1,d2 in order
to obtain the ﬁniteness result but, surprisingly enough, this is not the case. Indeed,
for example, in [Som00] is proved that the generic CICY of Tian-Yau type (see
Remark 8) in P3 × P3 contains a positive dimensional familiy of rational curves
for bidegrees (3, 3), whereas our Theorem says that the curves in M′
d1,d2 on such
general CICY are at most ﬁnite. These facts are not incompatible: the family of
rational curves constructed in [Som00] is a family of degenerate curves.

The main theorem is proved in Section 2; in Section 1 we brieﬂy ﬁx some notation
and discuss how to obtain all the conﬁguration matrices which give CICY’s in
X = Pa1 × Pa2 which are not equivalent to a family of CICY’s in some PN (it
is the same as to study complete intersections on PN which are nondegenerate).
In Section 4 we prove Theorem 9 which gives some results on the case of highly
degenerate curves:

Theorem. Let X = Pa1 × Pa2 and ﬁx a conﬁguration matrix A of a CICY. If
(d1, d2) ∈ {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)} then Jd1,d2 is irreducible and the generic Calabi-Yau
threefold Y in X with matrix conﬁguration A contains at most a ﬁnite number of
curves in Md1,d2.

In the Appendix there is an exhaustive list of conﬁguration matrices for X = Pa1×Pa2,
which are non degenerate and the list of all the bidegrees for each conﬁguration
matrix for which Theorem 5 holds.

This research project was partially supported by FIRB 2012 ”Moduli spaces and
Applications”.

1. CICY’s in Pa1 × Pa2 and configuration matrices

A Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau threefold in a variety X, CICY in short, is
a complete intersection of hypersurfaces of X. We are interested in CICY’s in
the product of two projective spaces Pa1 and Pa2, which will be denoted by X :=
Pa1 × Pa2. More generally, if X is the product of several projective spaces, possibly
of diﬀerent dimensions (call ai with i = 1 . . . l the dimensions of the projective
spaces), and Y is a CICY in X, the codimension of Y in X is given by

l

m =

ai − 3.

Xi=1

The algebraic variety Y it is described by the conﬁguration matrix associated to
Y , which is a matrix with m columns and l rows specifying the multidegrees of
the hypersurfaces that cut Y . To be more precise, recall ﬁrst that

Pic(X) =

l

Yi=1

i Pic(Pai) = h{OX (ei) | i = 1, . . . , l}i ,
π∗

so that

l

OX(b) = OX (b1, . . . , bl) :=

OX(ei)⊗bi.

Oi=1

If Y is the zero locus of s1, . . . , sm with sj ∈ H 0(OX (bj)), then the conﬁguration
matrix AY associated to Y is simply the matrix AY = (bij). Often, an extra
column on the left is added just to remember the dimension of the factors of X:




c1(Y ) =

Pa1
...
Pal

b11

bl1

· · ·




Pai we have

i=1

By a simple computation, one sees that if Y is a generic complete intersection of

l

Xi=1  −ai − 1 +

m

Xj=1

b1j! c1(OX(ei));

so we require the sum of the elements on each row of the matrix to be equal to the
dimension of the Pn (associated to that row) plus 1 in order to get a Calabi-Yau.
Some conﬁgurations cannot give irreducible varieties like, for example,

which yields a reducible variety for any c > 1.

c

b1

Pa2 0 b2 (cid:19)
(cid:18) P1

It is worth to observe that some conﬁgurations are equivalent to others. One can,
for example, permute the column or the rows of A but there are some nontrivial
ones: namely

(cid:18) Pa1 1 b1
Pa2 0 b2 (cid:19) ∼(cid:18) Pa1−1

Pa2

b1

b2 (cid:19)

as the column (1, 0)T means a section of π∗
1OPa1 (1) and thus it speciﬁes a hyper-
plane in Pa1. The conﬁgurations like that on the left are called degenerate. Several
others relations make possible the reduction to simpler conﬁgurations. We don’t
report them but the interested reader can have an insight of them at [GHL13].

There is a way to bound the number of CICY’s in the product of projective spaces.
Denote by p the number of P1 in the decomposition of X and by s the numbers
of projective spaces of dimension greater than 1, so that p + s = l. If

α =

l

Xi=1

(ai − 1)

RATIONAL CURVES IN CICY’S IN PRODUCTS OF TWO PROJECTIVE SPACES

5

then (see, for example, [GHL13]) any CICY of dimension 3 is equivalent to one in
a suitable X = Πl
i

Pai with

(2)

p ≤ α ≤ 6

and

s ≤ 9.

From now on, we assume to be in the case where X is the product of two projective
spaces of dimension a1 and a2, respectively. In this case, we have

α = a1 + a2 − 2 = dim(X) − 2 = m + 3 − 2 = m + 1

and the inequalities 2 gives us

p ≤ m + 1 ≤ 6.

Hence, the codimension of Y can be assumed to be at most 5. So, an admissible
matrix of a CICY can be searched among the 2 by m matrices with natural entries
such that the following hold:
• m is between 1 and 5;
• a1 + a2 = 3 + m;
• the sum on the i−th row is equal to ai + 1;
• the sum on the i−th column is greater than or equal to 2;
• if cei is a column of A then ai > 1;

In our case, these information alone are suﬃcient to conclude that the number of
such conﬁguration is ﬁnite and to write down all of these matrices. For example,
in codimension 1, i.e.
for the hypersurfaces case, we only have 2 conﬁgurations,
namely

(cid:18) P1 2
P3 4 (cid:19) (cid:18) P2 3
P2 3 (cid:19)

whereas for codimension equal to 2 we have a total of 11 conﬁgurations, up to
symmetries. In codimension 3, 4 and 5 there are, 22, 14 and 8 diﬀerent conﬁgu-
rations respectively. Summing up, we have a total of 57 conﬁgurations for non
degenerate CICY in the product of two projective spaces. Nevertheless notice that
some of these conﬁgurations yield the same family of Calabi-Yau threefolds. This
fact is indeed useful (see Remark 7). For the list of the 57 conﬁgurations and a
discussion about the conﬁgurations that give the same families, see Appendix A.

2. Rational curves in Pa1 × Pa2 of bidegree (d1, d2)

From now on, C will be a curve on X = Pa1 × Pa2 with ai ≥ 1. Recall that we can
deﬁne the bidegree of C to be the pair d = (d1, d2) if and only if

deg(OC(ei)) = di.

Equivalently, if one deﬁnes Hi to be a divisor such that OX (ei) = OX (Hi), C has
bidegree (d1, d2) if and only if C.Hi = di.

6

FILIPPO F. FAVALE

We will be interested in the moduli space Md = Md1,d2 of smooth rational curves
of bidegree (d1, d2) in X. If C ∈ Md1,d2 there exist

such that

α = (α0, . . . , αa1) ∈ H 0(OP1(d1))⊕(a1+1)

β = (β0, . . . , βa2) ∈ H 0(OP1(d2))⊕(a2+1)

P1

/ C 

/ Pa1 × Pa2

(t : u) ✤

/ (α(t : u), β(t : u))

The choice of α and β it is not unique: if we ﬁx projective coordinates on P1 they
are deﬁned up to multiplication by scalars so we have an element on

P(H 0(OP1(d1))a1+1) × P(H 0(OP1(d2))a2+1).

In order to get rid of the choice of the coordinates on P1 we can consider the
natural action of PGL(2). We can identify Md1,d2 with an open and irreducible
set in

(3)

(cid:0)P(H 0(OP1(d2))a2+1) × P(H 0(OP1(d2))a2+1)(cid:1) / PGL(2).

For example, in order to obtain really a curve of bidegree (d1, d2) we need to
discard all the maps (α, β) such that α ∈ (< f > ⊗H 0(OP1(d′
1))) for some f ∈
H 0(OP1(d′′
1 (and the same for β). This is indeed a closed set
in P(H 0(OP1(d1))a1+1) × P(H 0(OP1(d2))a2+1) like the set that yield singular curves.
In particular, we have that

d1,d2 to be the moduli space of smooth rational curves in X = Pa1 × Pa2
Deﬁne M′
of bidegree (d1, d2) with nondegenerate birational projections on the factors of X.
The elements of M′
d1,d2 are then curves in Md1,d2 such that πi|C : C → Ci :=
πi(C) ⊂ Pa
1 is a birational morphism on the image and Ci is a nondegenerate
curve in Pa
i . The last condition is equivalent to require that C does not lie in a
Pa1−1 × Pa2 or in a Pa1 × Pa2−1 inside X. If C ⊂ Pa1−1 × Pa2 then, for each (α, β)
whose image is C, we have α ∈ H 0(OP1(d1))a1+1 with {αj}a1+1
j=1 not indipendent,
which is a closed condition if a1 ≤ d1. Conversely, if α and β are two collections of
indipendent homogenous forms, they live on an open set. This is enough to prove
that having nondegenerate projections is an open condition. Asking πi|C to be
birational onto its image is also an open condition by semicontinuity so we have
that M′

d1,d2 is an open and irreducible set in Md1,d2.

Lemma 2. Let C be a curve of bidegree (d1, d2) on X = Pa1 × Pa2 and let L =
OX (b1, b2) with b1, b2 ≥ 0. Then

h0(IC/X (b1, b2)) =(cid:18)a1 + b1

b1 (cid:19)(cid:18)a2 + b2

b2 (cid:19) − 1 − b1d1 − b2d2 + h1(IC/X (b1, b2))

Proof. Start from the exact sequence of sheaves that deﬁnes OC and twist it by L
obtaining

0 → IC/X (b1, b2) → OX(b1, b2) → OC(b1, b2) → 0

and its associated cohomology sequence

(5)

0 → H 0(IC/X (b1, b2)) → H 0(OX (b1, b2)) → H 0(OC(b1, b2)) →

→ H 1(IC/X (b1, b2)) → H 1(OX (b1, b2))

By K¨unnet formula we have

H 1(OX (b1, b2)) =(cid:0)H 0(OPa1 (b1)) ⊗ H 1(OPa2 (b2))(cid:1)⊕(cid:0)H 1(OPa1 (b1)) ⊗ H 0(OPa2 (b2))(cid:1)

so H 1(OX(b1, b2)) = 0 because H 1(OPai (bi)) = 0 for bi ≥ 0. The claim follows by
observing that OC(b1, b2) has degree b1d1 + b2d2 as a line bundle on the rational
curve C because, by hypotesis, OC(ei) has degree di.
(cid:3)

3. CICY’s in Pa1 × Pa2 and rational curves in them

Consider the variety X = Pa1 × Pa2 and let Y be a Calabi-Yau threefold in X with
matrix conﬁguration AY = A. More precisely, if Y is the zero locus of the sections

sj ∈ H 0(OX (b1j, b2j)),

where j = 1, . . . , m. Then A = (bij) and we have Pj bij = ai + 1 to ensure that

c1(Y ) = 0. Set

m

SA :=

P(H 0(OX(b1j, b2j))),

Yj=1

and denote by PA the moduli space of CICY’s with matrix conﬁguration A in X.
Let UA be the open set of SA that correspond to the choices of set of sections that
yield smooth complete intersections in X. Thus, we have a map

which is a surjective morphism sending s to its zero locus V (s1, . . . , sm).
The dimension of UA is

σ : UA → PA

dim(UA) = dim(SA) =

Denote by Jd1,d2 the incidence correspondence given by

Jd1,d2 := {(C, s) ∈ Md1,d2 × UA | C ⊂ V (s1, . . . , sm) = σ(s)}

denote by J ′

Set theoretically, the ﬁber of p over C is precisely the set of the pairs (C, Y ),
where Y = σ(s) is a Calabi-Yau threefold with matrix conﬁguration A containing
C. This means that sj has to be in the ideal of C in X for all j. More precisely,
we have sj ∈ P(H 0(IC/X (b1j, b2j))) so that

as claimed.

(cid:3)

Proposition 4. Let A = (bij) be a matrix conﬁguration that yields a CICY in
X = Pa1 × Pa2. Assume that every curve in Md1,d2 (resp. every curve in M′
d1,d2)
is such that h1(IC/X(b1j, b2j)) = 0 for all j. Then

• Jd1,d2 is irreducible (resp. J ′
• for the generic Calabi-Yau threefold in X with matrix conﬁguration A, the
set of curves (resp. the set of curves with nondegenerate birational projec-
tions) of bidegree (d1, d2) contained in Y is either ﬁnite or empty.

d1,d2);

Proof. Under the assumptions and by Lemma 3, we have that the ﬁbers of p have
constant dimension given by

dim(p−1(C)) = dim(UA) − dim(Md1,d2).

Hence, we deduce that

dim(Jd1,d2) = dim(Md1,d2) + dim(p−1(C)) = dim(UA).

Then, as in [Kat86][Lemma 1.4], we can conclude that Jd1,d2 is irreducible of
dimension equal to dim(UA). Since q : Jd1,d2 → UA is a morphism between two
varieties with the same dimension, it is either dominant (and in this case its generic
ﬁber has dimension 0) or it has image contained in a proper subspace of P (and in
this case its generic ﬁber is empty). To conclude, it is enough to observe that the
ﬁber over Y ∈ UA is exactly the set of rational curves of bidegree (d1, d2) contained
in Y . The case with M′
(cid:3)

d1,d2 is analogous.

Given a conﬁguration matrix A = (bij) for a CICY Y in X = Pa1 × Pa2 (as usual,
m denotes the codimension of Y in X and is the number of columns of A), we will
denote by WA and ZA the sets deﬁned by
(9)

WA = {(d1, d2) | ai ≤ di}

(d1, d2) | ∀j = 1, . . . , m ∃u, v with u + v = 1 such that

a1 ≤ d1 ≤ a1 + b2j − 1 + v

and

ZA =(cid:26)

a2 ≤ d2 ≤ a2 + b1j − 1 + u (cid:27) .

Theorem 5. Let X be Pa1 × Pa2 with ai ≥ 2 and consider a nondegenerate matrix
conﬁguration1 A for a CICY in X. Then the following hold:

• the set ZA is not empty;
• if (d1, d2) 6∈ WA, then M′
• if (d1, d2) ∈ ZA, then J ′

d1,d2 is empty;
d1,d2 is irreducible and the generic CICY in UA

contains at most a ﬁnite number of elements of M′

d1,d2.

Proof. To see that ZA is not empty, it is enough to observe that (a1, a2) ∈ ZA for
all A because bij ≥ 0 and b1j and b2j cannot be both equal to 0. The second claim
is also easy: we have already observed that if either a1 > d1 or a2 > d2 then every

1Hence, it suﬃces to assume a1 + a2 ≤ 8 and consider only the matrices in Appendix A.

10

FILIPPO F. FAVALE

curve of bidegree (d1, d2) has to be degenerate: M′
we may assume ai ≤ di to ensure M′
follows from the fact that (d1, d2) ∈ ZA then

d1,d2 is empty. In what follows,
d1,d2 is not empty. The proof of the last claim

(10)

H 1(IC/X (b1j, b2j)) = 0

for all j = 1, . . . , m: we can indeed conclude by Proposition 4. To prove this, take
C ∈ M′
d1,d2 which is not empty by assumption. Consider a column (b1j, b2j) of the
conﬁguration matrix. By [Loz09] we have that C is (d2−a2+1, d1−a1+1)−regular.
Hence for all u, v such that u + v = 1 we have

H 1(IC/X (d2 − a2 + 1 − u, dv − av + 1 − v)) = 0.

By [MS04] we have also that

H 1(IC/X (d2 − a2 + 1 − u + n1, dv − av + 1 − v + n2)) = 0

for (n1, n2) ∈ N2 so if we ask

b1j ≥ d2 − a2 + 1 − u, b2j ≥ d1 − a1 + 1 − v

we have the wanted result: these inequalities, together with ai ≤ di, are exactly
the ones deﬁning ZA.
(cid:3)

Remark 6. There are some cases for which ZA is reduced to the unique pair (a1, a2),
as well as cases for which ZA has more elements. The complete list of the pairs
associated with the relative conﬁguration matrix can be found in Appendix B.

Remark 7. Note that Theorem 5 is only applicable for products Pa1 × Pa2 with
ai ≥ 2. Nevertheless, because more conﬁguration matrices represent the same
family of CICY, one may be able to say something also in cases for which a1 = 1.
For example, the relation

2c1

(cid:18) P1

Pa2

c2 (cid:19) ∼(cid:18) P2

Pa2 0 c2 (cid:19)

2 c1

works well in this direction. See Appendix A for major details.

Remark 8. Here we focus on the case of non degenerate rational curves and one
might wonder if the same result holds without this assumption, but this is not
the case. Consider, for example, the generic CICY Y in P3 × P3 with matrix
conﬁguration

A = (cid:18) P3 3 1 0

P3 0 1 3 (cid:19) ,

the so called Tian-Yau CICY. By Theorem 9 we have that Y contains at most

4. Results on Md1,d2 for di ≤ 1 for a CICY in Pa1 × Pa2

In this section X will denote Pa1 × Pa2. We will prove the following:

Theorem 9. Let X = Pa1 × Pa2 and ﬁx a conﬁguration matrix A of a CICY.
If (d1, d2) ∈ {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}, then Jd1,d2 is irreducible and the generic Calabi-
Yau threefold Y in X with matrix conﬁguration A contains at most a ﬁnite number
curves of Md1,d2.

We start with the following lemma

Lemma 10. Let C be a smooth subvariety of X = Pa1 × Pa2 and assume that
there exists a hyperplane H1 of Pa1 such that C ⊂ H1 × Pa2 := H. Then

H 1(IC/X (b1, b2)) ≃ H 1(IC/H (b1, b2))

for any b1, b2 ≥ 0.

Proof. Since H1 is a hyperplane in Pa1, we have IH/X = OX (−1, 0). From C ⊂
H ⊂ X we have the exact sequence

0 → IH/X → IC/X → IC/H → 0,

which we twist with OX (b1, b2). We can conclude by observing that, for p = 1, 2,
we have

H p(IH/X (b1, b2)) ≃ H p(OX (b1 − 1, b2)) = 0

as b1 − 1, b2 ≥ −1.

(cid:3)

Proof. (of Theorem 9) We cannot use [Loz09] because every curve C in Md1,d2
has a degenerate birational projection. We will use instead the fact that C is
indeed very degenerate by showing ”directly” that H 1(IC/X(b1j, b2j)) = 0 for
each column (b1j, b2j) of A and then concluding as in Proposition 4. Consider the
case (d1, d2) = (1, 1) (the other are similar). Let C be a curve of bidegree (1, 1)
in X. Then C is the image of γ : (t0 : t1) → (α1, α2) where αi ∈ H 0(OP1(1))ai+1.
If αi = (αi0, . . . , αiai) then it is clear that there exist ai − 1 indipendent linear
relations between them (if there are ai linear indipendent relations, then the image
of πi ◦ γ is a point and thus C cannot have bidegree (1, 1)). In particular, there
exist ai − 1 hyperplanes Hiki (ki = 1..(ai − 1)) in Pai such that C is contained in
H1k1 × Pa2 and in Pa1 × H2k2. By intersecting all these hypersurfaces we obtain a
P1 × P1. Using Lemma 10 we obtain

H 1(IC/X (b1j, b2j)) ≃ H 1(IC/P1×P1(b1j, b2j))

for each j = 1, . . . , m. The thesis follows immediately because C is a divisor of
bidegree (1, 1) on P1 × P1:

H 1(IC/P1×P1(b1j, b2j)) = H 1(OP1×P1(b1j − 1, b2j − 1)) = 0.

FILIPPO F. FAVALE

Remark 11. Both Lemma 10 and Theorem 9 can be stated for arbitrary products
of projective spaces. Indeed, both proofs can be adapted easily to this case. Hence
the generic (non degenerate) CICY in any product of projective spaces, without
assumption on the type of its conﬁguration matrix, contains at most a ﬁnite num-
ber of smooth rational curves of multidegrees (d1, . . . , dr) with di ≤ 1 (not all
0).

Appendix A. List of CICY’s in Pa1 × Pa2

Let Y be a CICY in X = Pa1 × Pa2 and call A its conﬁguration matrix. Then
either Y is degenerate or it has a matrix conﬁguration equivalent to one of the
following 57 matrices. The matrix conﬁgurations are divided by the numbers of
columns (i.e., the codimension of the associated CICY in X) and are classiﬁed
up to symmetries (and excluding the degenerate cases). Keep in mind that also
with these restrictions, more conﬁgurations may yield the same family of CICY’s.
Indeed, it is always true that

(cid:18) P1

Pa2

which tells us, for example, that

2c1

c2 (cid:19) ∼(cid:18) P2

Pa2 0 c2 (cid:19)

2 c1

(cid:18) P1 2
P3 4 (cid:19) ∼(cid:18) P2 2 1

P3 0 4 (cid:19) .

The reason to treat them as separate cases is that the methods used in the main
theorem may apply only for one of the descriptions (the example just presented
is one of these cases). The matrices with a superscript are those, up to the
author’s knowledge, for which this happens (more precisely, in the following list,
two matrices with the same superscript represent the same family of Calabi-Yau
threefold).

At last, the matrices with a ⋆ are those for which the corresponding ambient
space is a P1 × Pa2.

Appendix B. Bidegrees for which Theorem 5 holds

In Theorem 5 we concluded that the set of rational curves of M′
d1,d2 inside the
generic CICY with matrix conﬁguration A in Pa1 × Pa2 is either ﬁnite or empty if
(d1, d2) ∈ ZA. We proved that ZA is not empty; Still it is worth checking for which
values the Theorem holds. The following table displays ZA for all the conﬁguration
matrices A with a1, a2 ≥ 2, such that |ZA| ≥ 2 and that have at least 2 columns.
