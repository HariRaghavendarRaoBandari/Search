The pyrochlore Ho2Ge2O7 is a new highly correlated spin ice material. Physical property measure-
ments including x-ray diﬀraction, dc susceptibility and ac susceptibility, conﬁrm that it shares the
distinctive characteristics of other known spin ices. Polarized neutron scattering measurements on a
powder sample, combined with reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) reﬁnements, give unique information
about the spin ice state in Ho2Ge2O7. RMC reﬁnements are used to ﬁt the powder magnetic diﬀuse
scattering and predict the single crystal magnetic scattering of Ho2Ge2O7, demonstrating consistency
with spin ice behavior.

PACS numbers: 75.30.Cr, 75.40.Cx, 75.50.Lk

The pyrochlore lattice has provided condensed matter
physicists with a wide variety of magnetic behaviors to
study, due to the presence of geometric frustration [1].
Pyrochlores, with formula A2B2O7, are composed of two
interpenetrating sublattices of corner-sharing tetrahedra
where the A and B sites each form the vertices of one such
network. The A-site is commonly occupied by a magnetic
rare earth ion, which allows for highly frustrated interac-
tions. In some materials, the frustration can be overcome
at suﬃciently low temperatures and long range order can
be achieved. However, in many magnetic pyrochlores
the frustrated interactions are prohibitive to long range
ordering, and instead novel ground states, such as spin
liquids, spin glasses or spin ices, are adopted [2].

The spin ice state was ﬁrst observed in Ho2Ti2O7 by
Harris et al. in 1997 [3]; since that time spin ices have been
a subject of active experimentation, allowing theorists to
come a long way towards understanding this remarkable
ground state. In spin ices, the local crystal ﬁeld acting
on the magnetic ions results in nearly perfect Ising spins
which align along the axis that joins the centers of two
neighboring tetrahedra. When combined with overall
ferromagnetic nearest-neighbour interactions, this results
in short-range magnetic order with two spins pointing
inwards and two spins pointing outwards from the center
of each tetrahedron.

Despite signiﬁcant interest in this class of compounds,
only a handful of spin ice materials have been discovered
to date, including the titanates, A2Ti2O7 [3–6], the stan-
nates, A2Sn2O7 [7, 8], and more recently, the germanates,
A2Ge2O7 [9–11] (A = Ho, Dy). Spin ices have recently
garnered further attention as the hosts of quasiparticles

resembling magnetic monopoles [12–14]. This paper de-
tails the synthesis and characterization of a new highly
correlated spin ice candidate, Ho2Ge2O7. Reverse Monte
Carlo (RMC) reﬁnement is utilized to conﬁrm that the
ice rules are obeyed in this material and to demonstrate
the suitability of this material to act as a monopole host.
When prepared under ambient pressure with a conven-
tional solid state reaction, Ho2Ge2O7 is a pyrogermanate
with a tetragonal structure [15]. Synthesis of polycrys-
talline Ho2Ge2O7 in the pyrochlore phase was performed
with a high-temperature and high-pressure technique. Sto-
ichiometric amounts of Ho2O3 and GeO2, wrapped in gold
foil, were compressed to 7 GPa and heated to 1000 ◦C
in a Walker-type, multi-anvil press. The quality of the
sample was assessed using a Guinier image plate x-ray
diﬀractometer with a rotating copper anode source. Ri-
etveld reﬁnement with FullProf [16] showed no discernible
impurities.
The x-ray diﬀraction pattern of Ho2Ge2O7, shown in
Fig. 1(a), contains superlattice peaks at 2θ ≈ 15◦ and
30◦ for the (111) and (311) Bragg peaks respectively,
indicating a pyrochlore type lattice (left insert of Fig.
1(a)). Rietveld reﬁnement of the XRD pattern conﬁrmed
the face-centered cubic pyrochlore phase (Fd3m, No. 227)
and the absence of any tetragonal pyrogermanate impurity.
The room temperature lattice parameter was determined
to be a = 9.9026(6) ˚A, which agrees well with the reported
value [11]. The lattice parameter is signiﬁcantly reduced
from previously synthesized holmium pyrochlores by the
introduction of the much smaller germanium cation onto
the B-site (Ho2Sn2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7 have a = 10.3762 ˚A
and a = 10.1059 ˚A respectively [17]).

(b) The temperature dependence of the dc susceptibility for
Ho2Ge2O7 measured with H = 0.1 T. (c) The dc magnetiza-
tion for Ho2Ge2O7 measured at T = 2 K.

The dc magnetic susceptibility, χ, of Ho2Ge2O7 mea-
sured from 1.8 K to 20 K with a ﬁeld intensity of 0.1 T
shows no sign of long range magnetic ordering (Fig.
1(b)). The Curie-Weiss temperature for this material
is θCW = 0.06 K. Small Curie-Weiss temperatures arise
in spin ice materials due to the comparable scales of
the magnetic exchange, Jnn, and ferromagnetic dipolar
interactions, Dnn, between nearest neighbors [10]. The
Curie-Weiss temperatures for Ho2Sn2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7
are 1.8 K and 1.9 K respectively. The much smaller θCW in
Ho2Ge2O7 results from the reduction in lattice parameter
[10]. The eﬀective magnetic moment in Ho2Ge2O7, de-
rived from the dc susceptibility, is 10.2(1) µB per holmium.
However, the magnetization, measured at 2 K (Fig. 1(c)),
saturates at ∼5 µB per holmium. The saturated mo-
ment in polycrystalline spin ice samples is reduced to half
the value of the magnetic moment at each site due to
the <111> local Ising magnetic anisotropy and powder
averaging.

The ac susceptibility measurements on Ho2Ge2O7 were
made using frequencies ranging from 80 Hz to 6 kHz
in dc ﬁelds of 0 T to 1 T with temperatures between
0.5 K and 30 K. The real part of the ac susceptibility,
χ(cid:48), below 3 K is shown in Fig. 2(a). With an applied
frequency of 80 Hz, the susceptibility drops at 1.3 K and
approaches zero in the limit of 0.5 K. Concurrently, the
imaginary part, χ(cid:48)(cid:48), (Fig. 2(b)) contains a single maximum

T with varying frequency; (f) Arrhenius law ﬁt of the high
temperature peak position in χ(cid:48)(cid:48)

at ∼1.2 K. In both the real and imaginary parts, the
peak position shifts towards higher temperature with
increasing frequency. The peak position in χ(cid:48)(cid:48), T1, is
frequency dependent and can be ﬁt to an Arrhenius law,
f = f0 exp(−E1/(kBT1)), which yields E1/k = 20(2) K
(Fig. 2(c)). At high temperatures with a frequency of
1 kHz a second peak begins to emerge in χ(cid:48)(cid:48) at ∼18 K
with increasing ﬁeld strength (Fig. 2(d)). Similarly to
the ﬁrst peak, the position of the peak when measured
in a 1 T ﬁeld is frequency dependent (Fig. 2(e)) and can
likewise be ﬁt to an Arrhenius law. The ﬁt for the second
peak, T2, gives an energy barrier of E2/k = 196(10) K
(Fig. 2(f)).

The presence and position of these peaks in the imag-
inary part of the ac susceptibility for Ho2Ge2O7 is con-
sistent with observations for other known spin ices. The
energy barrier of 20 K in the low temperature, spin freez-
ing region is related to local spins adopting an ice-like
state. The comparable energy barriers for Ho2Sn2O7 and
Ho2Ti2O7 are 19.6 K and 27.5 K respectively [17]. The
second, high temperature, energy barrier for Ho2Ge2O7

Neutron polarization analysis was performed on a
290 mg powder sample of Ho2Ge2O7 using the D7 diﬀuse
scattering spectrometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin
[19]. The instrument was run in XYZ polarization analy-
sis mode to allow the separation of the magnetic scatter-
ing from the nuclear-coherent, isotope-incoherent and
spin-incoherent components. An incident wavelength
of 4.855 ˚A was selected, allowing Q space coverage
from 0.25 ˚A−1 to 2.5 ˚A−1. Measurements were taken
at four temperatures, 50 mK, 1.3 K, 3.6 K, and 10.6 K
using a dilution refrigerator and a 4He cryostat.

The magnetic diﬀuse scattering of Ho2Ge2O7, shown
in Fig. 3(a), has the characteristic shape for a spin ice
at 50 mK. The minima observed at Q ≈ 1.3 ˚A−1 and
2.2 ˚A−1 are likely the result of pinch-point singularities.
It is the dipolar correlations in spin ices that give rise
to pinch-points, a deﬁning feature of these materials [14].
However, they can only be directly observed in a single
crystal diﬀraction experiment with suﬃcient resolution.
In Ho2Ge2O7, the (002) and (222) pinch-points would
give rise to a minima at Q = 1.268 ˚A−1 and Q = 2.196
˚A−1 respectively, which agrees with the observed minima
positions in Fig. 3(b). The (111) pinch-point would
correspond to a minimum at Q = 1.098 ˚A−1 which is not
clearly deﬁned as it overlaps with the (002) minimum. The
characteristic minima observed in the magnetic diﬀuse
scattering suggest that Ho2Ge2O7 is a likely spin ice.

The temperature dependence of the magnetic diﬀuse
scattering in spin ices has been previously measured by
Mirebeau et al. for Ho2Ti2O7 [20]. The magnetic diﬀuse
scattering for Ho2Ge2O7 was measured at four temper-
atures (Fig. 3(a)) to determine what, if any, eﬀect the
stronger correlations in this spin ice would have on the
higher temperature scattering.
In Ho2Ge2O7, the dif-
ferences in magnetic diﬀuse scattering between 50 mK
and 1.3 K are quite minimal, indicating that the spin ice
state is, essentially, fully formed by 1.3 K. At 3.6 K the
ice-like scattering is still prominent with some broadening
of features as a larger portion of spins are disordered at
this temperature. Characteristic ice-like scattering is still
visible even at 10.6 K; however, at this temperature the
majority of spins are disordered. These eﬀects of temper-
ature on the magnetic diﬀuse scattering are consistent
with the results for other spin ices.

The reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) technique was em-
ployed to ﬁt the powder data and examine the temper-
ature evolution of the magnetism in Ho2Ge2O7 in more
detail. This approach has been previously shown to pro-
duce accurate models of frustrated magnetic structures
based on powder data [21]. The RMC method does not
consider a magnetic Hamiltonian, but instead involves
reﬁning the orientations of spins within a large conﬁgu-
ration to obtain the best possible ﬁt to data. The only
constraint used in the following reﬁnements is that the

spins behave as purely Ising variables (i.e., Si = Sizi,
with Ising pseudo-spin Si = ±1 directed along one of the
cubic zi = <111> axes). The powder scattering intensity
is calculated from the RMC spin conﬁgurations using the
exact expression for a magnetically anisotropic system
[22]. Reﬁnements are performed using spin conﬁgurations
of 53 crystallographic unit cells (2000 spins), using peri-
odic boundary conditions, and calculated quantities are
averaged over at least 16 independent conﬁgurations.

The RMC ﬁts obtained for Ho2Ge2O7 show excellent
agreement with the experimental data at all four tem-
peratures (Fig. 3(a)). The fraction of ice rules defects
(defect density) which appear in the RMC spin conﬁgura-
tions at each temperature can be calculated from these
ﬁts. These values represent an upper bound on the true
defect density because RMC ﬁtting is a stochastic ap-
proach which will tend to produce the most disordered
spin conﬁgurations compatible with experiment. The
overestimation is most serious below ∼1 K, where the
anticipated defect density and the error have the same
order of magnitude. Nevertheless, at higher temperatures,
the “experimental” RMC defect densities can be usefully
compared to the theoretical values determined from a spin
ice Hamiltonian. This provides an independent check on
whether spin ice behavior describes the basic dynamics
of Ho2Ge2O7. Accordingly, in Fig. 3(b) the RMC defect
densities are compared with the theoretical values, which
are determined from direct Monte Carlo simulations of
the nearest-neighbour spin ice model using an eﬀective
interaction Jeﬀ = 1.63 K [10]. As anticipated, the RMC
upper bound at 50 mK of ∼10% is anomalously large.
There is, however, qualitative agreement with the exper-

where f1 is the fraction of tetrahedra with a single ice rules
defect and f2 is the fraction of tetrahedra with a double
defect. Spin conﬁgurations were generated using direct
Monte Carlo simulations of the nearest-neighbor spin ice
model, as described above. The entropy calculated from
these spin conﬁgurations using Eq. 1 shows surprisingly
good agreement with experiment (Fig. 3(c)), given the
assumption of independent tetrahedra in Eq. 1 and the
use of the simple nearest-neighbour spin ice model.

However, it is known that the nearest-neighbour spin
ice model does not fully describe real spin ice materi-
als. For a better description it is necessary to also con-
sider the magnetic dipolar interaction [4, 25] and possible
smaller exchange interactions beyond nearest-neighbors
[26]. These interactions slightly favor certain ice rules con-
ﬁgurations over others, and give rise to subtle diﬀerences
between single crystal neutron scattering patterns for dif-
ferent spin ice materials. Obtaining a single crystal of
Ho2Ge2O7 in order to investigate such eﬀects is currently
unfeasible due to the high pressure required for synthesis.
However, the RMC approach can be used to predict the
single crystal diﬀuse scattering from powder data [21]. By
using the collective ‘loop’ spin-ﬂips described in [27] as
the basic RMC move, it is possible to enforce the ice rules.
Thus, the nearest neighbor correlations are ﬁxed and the
sensitivity of the RMC reﬁnement to small variations in
further neighbor correlations can be maximized.

The eﬀectiveness of this approach was ﬁrst tested by
ﬁtting powder data collected on D7 for the two canon-
ical spin ices Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7 (Fig. 4(a) and
(c)). The single crystal scattering was then calculated
from the RMC spin conﬁgurations and compared with
actual experimental data (Fig. 4(b) and (d)). The close
agreement between experimental single crystal data and
the RMC predictions demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of
the approach. The powder data for Ho2Ge2O7 were then
ﬁtted in the same way with a good ﬁt to data obtained
(Fig. 4(e)). This result places a lower bound of zero
on the density of ice rules defects present in Ho2Ge2O7
at 50 mK. The predicted single crystal scattering for
Ho2Ge2O7 (Fig. 4(f)) diﬀers slightly from both Ho2Ti2O7
and Dy2Ti2O7, but appears to resemble Ho2Ti2O7 more
closely. The radial spin correlation function was also cal-
culated for all three spin ices, showing distinguishable
diﬀerences between Ho2Ge2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7 only in
the third neighbor correlations, for which Ho2Ge2O7 is
somewhat less ferromagnetic.

The pyrochlore Ho2Ge2O7 exhibits all the distinctive

imental single defect densities at T ≥ 1.3 K. The RMC
density of double defects is zero at low temperatures and
remains small at 10.6 K, in accordance with the theoreti-
cal prediction. This agreement with the nearest-neighbour
spin ice model suggests ice-like dynamics are present in
Ho2Ge2O7.

The magnetic heat capacity for Ho2Ge2O7 is shown in
Zhou et al. [10]. The integration of the magnetic heat
capacity divided by temperature, Cmag/T , gives magnetic
−1
tetK−1 (Fig. 3(c)). The zero
entropy Smag = 8.2 Jmol
point entropy is calculated by taking the diﬀerence of
this value and the expected value for an Ising system,
S = 2R ln(2) per tetrahedron, which gives the character-
istic spin ice zero point entropy, S0 = R ln(3/2). Using

properties of a dipolar spin ice: a small, positive Curie-
Weiss constant; Pauling zero-point entropy; magnetiza-
tion which saturates to half the magnetic moment; a spin
freezing transition in the ac susceptibility; and the char-
acteristic magnetic diﬀuse scattering of spin ices. Reverse
Monte Carlo reﬁnements using powder diﬀuse scattering
data suggest that the data are consistent with no vio-
lations of the ice rule at 50 mK, although powder data
alone cannot exclude the possibility that a fraction of
monopoles of up to 10% remains present. The RMC re-
ﬁnements also allow us to predict the single crystal diﬀuse
scattering for Ho2Ge2O7, revealing the presence of spin
correlations closely resembling the dipolar spin ice model.
Thus, Ho2Ge2O7 will be the best natural candidate for
monopole studies involving neutron scattering.
