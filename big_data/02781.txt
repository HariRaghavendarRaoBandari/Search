We numerically investigate the dynamic heterogeneity and its length scale found in

the coarse-grained ionic liquid model systems.

In our ionic liquid model systems,

cations are modeled as dimers with positive charge, while anions are modeled as

monomers with negative charge, respectively. To study the eﬀect of the charge dis-

tributions on the cations, two ionic liquid models with diﬀerent charge distributions

are used and the model with neutral charge is also considered as a counterpart. To

reveal the heterogeneous dynamics in the model systems, we examine spatial distri-

butions of displacement and time distributions of exchange and persistence times. All

the models show signiﬁcant increase of the dynamic heterogeneity as the temperature

is lowered. The dynamic heterogeneity is quantiﬁed via the well-known four-point

susceptibility, χ4(t), which measures the ﬂuctuation of a time correlation function.

The dynamic correlation length is calculated by ﬁtting the dynamic structure factor,

S4(k, t), with Ornstein-Zernike form at the time scale at which the dynamic hetero-

geneity reaches the maximum value. Obtained time and length scales exhibit a power

law relation at the low temperatures, similar to various supercooled liquid models.

Especially, the charged model systems show unusual crossover behaviors which are

not observed in the uncharged model system. We ascribe the crossover behavior to

the enhanced cage eﬀect caused by charges on the particles.

INTRODUCTION

Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have attracted great attention because of their

uncommon physical properties and various applications including non-toxic solvents, elec-

trolytes, and supercapacitors.1–5 Widely known features of RTILs are their thermal stabil-

ity, high polarity, high viscosity, very low vapor pressure, and low combustibility.3 Usually,

RTILs are composed of bulky, asymmetric cations and small, symmetric anions. Due to

their considerable size diﬀerence, RTILs exist in a liquid phase near the room temperature

in spite of the presence of strong Coulomb interaction. One of the intriguing features of

RTILs is their heterogeneous dynamics. As reported by theoretical6–10 and experimental

studies,11–13 the evidences of the heterogeneous dynamics such as a non-exponential decay

of correlation functions have been found. Computer simulation studies also have found the

glassy dynamics of RTILs which is characterized by the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein

relation and decoupling of exchange and persistence events of deﬁned excitations.6,7

There have been previous computational studies on the description of the heterogeneous

dynamics in the ionic liquid systems.14–18 However, the length scale of the dynamic het-

erogeneity has not been investigated thoroughly19 because of the diﬃculties on performing

massive simulation with complex structures and long range interactions. To overcome this

diﬃculty and to enhance computational eﬃciency, various levels of the coarse-grained mod-

els have been proposed.7–9,20,21 Among these models, we use simple models of RTILs which

are introduced by a previous study20 and investigated intensively by Park et al..6

In the previous study, Ref 6, we examined the structural and dynamic properties of

RTILs thoroughly. Especially, the relation between the time scale of the heterogeneous

dynamics and the length scale of the structural relaxation were studied. According to

the simulation results, calculated lifetime of the heterogeneous dynamics, τdh, could be

regarded as a distinctive time scale from the relaxation time. While the lifetime of the

heterogeneous dynamics is calculated using the three-time correlation functions, the length

scale was not examined.

In the present study, we further investigate the heterogeneous

dynamics of RTILs initiated in Ref 6. We show the simulation results that support the

existence of the heterogeneous dynamics in our model systems. Furthermore, we present

the simulation results on the length scale of the heterogeneous dynamics and the scaling

relation between the relaxation time to show the distinctive nature of RTILs against the

2

model without Coulomb interaction.

The heterogeneous dynamics found in RTILs have similar aspects found in the supercooled

liquids. When the liquids are cooled down rapidly, they exist in supercooled liquids rather

than forming a crystal structure. The viscosity and the structural relaxation time grow

dramatically as the temperature of the system is lowered. The complete understanding of

these physical phenomena and their theoretical explanations are still lacking. Among the

distinctive behaviors of the supercooled liquids, the correlations between the time-dependent

local density ﬂuctuations are found to play an important role in the slowing down of system.

This phenomenon, typically called dynamic heterogeneity, has been investigated through

diverse theoretical6,10,22–37 and experimental studies.38–43

In previous theoretical and computational studies, the time and length scales of the dy-

namic heterogeneity have been obtained using the four-point density correlation functions,31–35,44–50

which has its origin in the study of spin glasses.51 A four-point correlation function is deﬁned

as

g4(r, t) = (cid:104)δρ(0, 0)δρ(0, t)δρ(r, 0)δρ(r, t)(cid:105)
−(cid:104)δρ(0, 0)δρ(0, t)(cid:105)(cid:104)δρ(r, 0)δρ(r, t)(cid:105),

(1)

where δρ(r, t) is the deviation of the local density at the position r and at time t. g4(r, t)

measures the correlation of relaxation of the density ﬂuctuation between the two points

separated by r. The dynamic susceptibility and the dynamic structure factor can be derived

from this function, by integrating and by performing Fourier transform, respectively. We use

the dynamic susceptibility as an index of the quantiﬁcation of the dynamic heterogeneity

and deﬁne the time value that makes the dynamic susceptibility maximum as a characteristic

time scale of the dynamic heterogeneity. The dynamic structure factor is also calculated

to extract the dynamic length scale, ξ4(t), which could be interpreted as a length scale of

dynamically correlated regions. With these schemes, we ﬁnd the characteristic time scale

and the length scale of the dynamic heterogeneity in the ionic liquid model systems.

The contents of this article are organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce ionic liquid

models and describe shortly the simulation methods. In Section 3, the evidences of hetero-

geneous dynamics in the ionic liquid models are shown using displacement distributions and

the decoupling of the mean exchange time and the mean persistence time. Furthermore,

3

the dynamic length scale obtained by calculating the four-point correlation functions and

related scaling behavior will be illustrated. Finally, the conclusions on this work are shown

in the Section 4.

II. MODELS

FIG. 1. Schematic representation of the three models. SCM (top) and ACM (middle) represent
symmetrically charged and asymmetrically charged model of ionic liquid, respectively. While the
anions of both model have the charge of −1.0e, the cations have diﬀerent charge distribution: the
positive charge is equally distributed for the SCM cation particles (+0.5e for C1 and C2), the
charge is separated for the ACM cation particles (+1.0e for C1 and zero for C2). UCM (bottom)
denotes the uncharged model as a comparison group without charge on every particles. Figure

We use simple coarse-grained models to investigate the heterogeneous dynamics of the

room-temperature ionic liquid systems. In order to study the eﬀect of charge distribution on

the cation, the symmetrically charged model (SCM) and the asymmetrically charged model

(ACM) are used. In addition, the uncharged model (UCM) is also used as a comparison

group. Three model systems have the cation composed of two particles and the anion of

single particle (Fig.1). All the physical parameters are the same for those models except the

charge distribution. SCM has +0.5e (where e is the elementary charge) on each particle in
the cation and −1.0e on the anion, while ACM has +1.0e on C1 particle, zero charge on C2
particle, and also −1.0e for the anion. UCM has zero charge for all particles. We also use
the term “cation” and “anion” for the UCM, for convenience, even if the model does not

0.8σ. The mass of the particles in the cation is m = 100 amu and the mass of the anion is 200

energy, and mass scaled by the units of σ, , and m. The other units are converted by the

following relations: unit time, t0 = (mσ2/)1/2 = 5 ps, unit temperature, T0 = /kB = 240.5

2048 pairs of RTIL molecules in a cubic simulation box of L = 17.88, where L is the length
of each side. All the system have the reduced number density ρ∗ = ρσ3 = 0.716.

We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using GROMACS 4.5 MD package

program53 under N V T ensemble condition with Nos´e-Hoover thermostat. Periodic bound-

ary condition is applied to each direction and the ﬁnite size eﬀect is carefully checked by

comparing physical quantities calculated from systems with diﬀerent size of 512, 1024, 2048

and 4096 RTIL pairs. For all the systems, ten independent trajectories are used and the

length of production run is about 40 times of the α-relaxation time of each system. The

details of the molecular dynamics simulation conditions are given in Ref. 6.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Heterogeneous dynamics

Our ionic liquid model systems are expected to have the heterogeneous dynamics because

of the size diﬀerence between the cation and the anion. To investigate the heterogeneous

dynamics in detail, we ﬁrst calculate the displacement of each particle. Fig.2(a) shows

the probability of the logarithm of displacements, P [log10(δr); t], of the cation in SCM.
The time t is set to be the α-relaxation time, t = τα, at each temperature, where the α-

relaxation time is deﬁned by the time at which the normalized overlap function, Q(t)/N ,

falls into 1/e (See Fig.5). The deﬁnition of the overlap function will be introduced in Section

3.2. P [log10(δr); t] is related to the self-van Hove function, Gs(δr; t), through the equation,
P [log10(δr); t] = 4πlog(10)δr3Gs(δr; t). Since Gs(δr; t) follows a Gaussian function when

6

the particle experienced the Fickian diﬀusion, P [log10(δr); t] would show a single peak.
Therefore, the broadening or split of the distribution is a clear evidence for non-Fickian

motion and heterogeneous dynamics.

FIG. 3. Spatial distributions of the persistence times of the cation (Green) and the anion (Red) at
the high temperature (T=6.24) (a) and the low temperature (T=1.12) (b). The size of the sphere is
proportional to the log of persistence time of each particle. The comparison of two snapshots clearly
shows that persistence time is heterogeneous in time and also in space at the low temperature.

In Fig.2(a), the distribution of the cation in SCM is getting broader as the temperature is

lowered. Compared to the anion case, the cation clearly shows more heterogeneous dynamics

at lower termperatures. (See the supporting information for the data of the ACM, UCM

cases.) The results is consistent with the previous study that demonstrates the cation moves

faster than the anion.6 For the ACM case, the distribution of the anion is more heterogeneous

than the cation. This opposite result comes from the diﬀerent charge distribution of the

cation. Compared to the SCM, the cations in the ACM make irregular structures around

the anions because of their asymmetric charge distribution. As a result, it is expected that

relatively small anion could have fast movement. In the UCM system, alternating structure

of the cations and the anions are not observed, since there is no charge on the cations.6

The cage eﬀect would be suppressed and the distributions of two particles show the similar

results. The diﬀerence of two distributions are not profound but the anions have higher

7

ratio of fast particles because of lower steric hindrance.

Fig.2(b) and Fig.2(c) show the time dependence of the probability distributions and the

corresponding self-van Hove functions of the cations in SCM. A single peak at short time
evolves into a broad distribution at t ∼ 1τα and becomes a single peak again in the long
time limit. From this results, we can infer that the dynamics are most heterogeneous at time
around from t ∼ 1τα to t ∼ 5τα. In the ACM and UCM, similar tendency is found for the cal-
culated distributions. At long time limit, the self-van Hove function is approaching the Gaus-
sian distribution shown as a dashed line in Fig.2(c), Gs(δr; t) = (4πDt)−3/2exp(−δr2/(4Dt)),
where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. However, even at t = 50τα, there exists a mismatch at

small and large r, which means that the dynamic heterogeneity still remains at this long

time case.

abruptly at the low temperatures. (SCM) (d) The mean persistence time and the mean exchange
time show power law relationship. (SCM) The data of ACM and UCM cases are presented in the

To characterize the dynamic heterogeneity in a diﬀerent way, we calculate the excitation of

each particle.7,37 The excitation is deﬁned as an event that single particle i moves more than
distance d. For example, when particle i moved more than d at time t1, |ri(t1) − ri(0)| > d,
than the ﬁrst excitation takes place at t = t1. Further, when particle moved more than d
from the ri(t1) after t2, |ri(t1 + t2) − ri(t1)| > d, than the second excitation is at t = t1 + t2.
For the third excitation at t = t1+t2+t3, same rule is applied, |ri(t1+t2+t3)−ri(t1+t2)| > d,
and so on. Using the series of the excitations, we can deﬁne two time scales, the persistence

time and the exchange time. The persistence time is the time value that the ﬁrst excitation

Another time scale,

the exchange time, is deﬁned by the waiting time between two excitations. It is the set of

all t2, t3, .... It has been known that the decoupling of the two time scales occurs when the

system is dynamically heterogeneous.7,23,37 Jung et al. ﬁrst calculated the relationship of the

two time scales in the kinetically constrained model (KCM) and showed that the dynamic

heterogeneity provokes the decoupling of the two time scales.23 Although the deﬁnition of

the excitation is diﬀerent from the case of the KCM, the physical meanings are similar in

the ionic liquids systems and it can be applied for studying the heterogeneous dynamics in

those systems. This analysis scheme has been applied to study the heterogeneous nature of

the supercooled liquids, the ionic liquids, and the ring polymer melts.7,23,37,54

Before analyzing the decoupling of the two time scales, we visualize the heterogeneous

dynamics using the persistence time of each particle. Fig.3 shows the spatial distributions

of the persistence times. The radius of each particle represents the size of the persistence

time in logarithm scale. For the cufoﬀ distance d, we used d = 1 which is comparable to the

size of the particles. At the high temperature, Fig.3(a), the persistence time distribution

is relatively homogeneous than that at the low temperature, Fig.3(b). Note that not only

the size of sphere is heterogeneous at the low temperature but the spatial distribution also

shows the heterogeneity. This means that there is a correlation between the slow particles

and this could be the evidence of growing dynamic length scale.

Now, we investigate the decoupling of the two time scales and relate this phenomenon

with the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. When the probability distribution

of the exchange time is exponential, the distribution of the two time scales is identical

because the persistence time is related with the exchange time through the integral.23 At high

temperatures, there is a weak correlation between the excitation events, which indicates that

excitation events follow the Possion process. At low temperature, however, the correlations

between the excitation is pronounced and the excitation events would experience non-Possion

process that results in decoupling of the persistence time and the exchange time distributions,

Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b). We can interpret this phenomenon that the correlation between

excitations increases because of the clustering of the slow particles.

The mean values of the two time scales also show the decoupling. The mean persistence

time and the mean exchange time, which are deﬁned by the ensemble average of the per-
sistence times, τp = (cid:104)tp(cid:105), and the exchange times, τe = (cid:104)te(cid:105), are related to the transport

9

coeﬃcients, the relaxation time and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, respectively.7 It has been known

that the mean persistence time would be proportional to the relaxation time, τ , when d is

comparable with 2π/q where q is the ﬁrst peak position of the structure factor. Further-

more, the exchange event is governed by the diﬀusion of particle so that 1/τe would have

relation between diﬀusion constant, D, through power law relation. Since the ionic liquid

system is a kind of fragile liquids,6,7 it has been shown that there is a sublinear relation

between 1/τe and D, irrespective of d.7 This is due to the correlation between the excitation
events.23 The power law relations between τp and τα, and the relations between τe and 1/D

are shown in supporting information. Length scale d dependence is also investigated in

FIG.S7. Fig.4(c) shows the ratio of τp and τe, which shows similar divergent behavior of Dτ
at low temperatures.6 In addition, there are power law relations, τe ∼ τ ν
p , between the two
physical time scales as it can be seen in Fig.4(d). The value of the power law exponents are

0.81 (SCM-cation), 0.85 (SCM-anion), 0.78 (ACM-cation), 0.77 (ACM-anion), 0.89 (UCM-

cation) and 0.83 (UCM-anion). The exponent of the SCM cation is analogous to that of the

coarse-grained ionic liquids system which is 0.80 for the cations.7 Comparing the values of

the exponents, we can infer that the fragility of the system increases in the order of UCM,

SCM and ACM. More detailed informations can be found in the supporting information.

liquids system are also found in our ionic liquids model systems. From the displacement

distribution, we ﬁnd the clue that the mobility of the particles are heterogeneously dis-

tributed. However, the correlations between slow or fast particles can not be obtained from

this analysis. In order to observe this correlated behavior, a four-point correlation function

is introduced to calculate the dynamic length scale in the next section. It is noteworthy

that the distribution of the charge on the cations not only changes the local structure but

also aﬀects the fragility of the whole system. From the scaling analysis, we ﬁnd that the

diﬀerence between the cation and the anion is smaller compared to the diﬀerences between

the model systems. Thus, we concentrate on the diﬀerences between the models rather than

the type of ions.

B. The dynamic susceptibility and the dynamic structure factor

In the previous studies of glassy dynamics, there have been several diﬀerent schemes to

deﬁne the length scale of the dynamic heterogeneity.32,33,45,48,55–57 Among them, the dynamic

length scale deﬁned from the four-point correlation function has been widely adopted for

many systems. The four-point correlation function given in Eq.1 measures the correlation

of the relaxation of the density ﬂuctuation. Since the dynamic susceptibility is obtained by

integrating g4(r, t) over the space, the dynamic susceptibility can be regarded as a volume

of the correlated motion. Furthermore, the dynamic susceptibility can be written in the

Q(t) =

w(|ri(0) − ri(t)|),

(6)

where w(|ri(0) − ri(t)|) is a overlap function which is 0 when |ri(0) − ri(t)| > a and 1
when |ri(0) − ri(t)| ≤ a. Q(t) counts the number of self overlapping particles using the
conﬁgurations separated by a time interval t. Thus, Q(t)/N could be regarded as an index

how much the system has been relaxed. Fig.5 shows that Q(t)/N decays from 1 to 0 as

the time is passed, showing similar functional behavior with the self-intermediate scattering

function.

In Fig.5, we ﬁnd that Q(t)/N in charged systems shows more stretched form

compared to that in the UCM. The diﬀerence between the model systems comes from the

diﬀerent local environment that the particles experience. Detailed discussion will be given

in Section 3.3. Eq.5 tells that χ4(t) can be interpreted as a quantiﬁcation of a ﬂuctuation

of Q(t). In this study, we choose overlap cutoﬀ a = 0.3 as used in other studies.33,34 The α-

relaxation time, τα, can be deﬁned as the time at which Q(τα)/N = 1/e. This deﬁnition gives

analogous value of τα with the result of the conventional use of self-intermediate scattering

function. Additionally, for the cations, χ4(t) calculated using the coordinates of the center

of mass and the particle itself did not show distinctive diﬀerence for the scaling law. We

will use the simulation data obtained by calculations with center of mass for each cation.

4(T ), which is comparable to the relaxation time, τα(T ). We
ﬁnd that t∗
4 is proportional and almost equal to τα for all the three model systems (See
the supporting information). This time scale, t∗
4, which shows the maximum value of the
dynamic susceptibility, χ∗
4), is deﬁned as a characteristic time scale of the dynamic
heterogeneity. As the time increases further, χ4(t) decreases to zero. The functional form of

compared to the models of supercooled liquids. This phenomenon is based on the enhanced

separation of sub-diﬀusive regime and diﬀusive regime for charged model. The details about

the crossover behavior will be discussed in the next section.

An alternative deﬁnition of the dynamic susceptibility can be used,45

can be expressed in the form, (1/N )(cid:80)N

where k = |k|. Here, k is a wavevector that regulates the length scale of local area

l=1(cid:104)δ ˜Qj(k, t)δ ˜Ql(−k, t)(cid:105), where δ ˜Qj(k, t) =
eik·(rj (t)−rj (0)) − (cid:104)eik·(rj (t)−rj (0))(cid:105). In this form, the self part of ˜χ4(k, t) can be easily obtained
4 (k, t) = 1 − Fs(k, t)2, where Fs(k, t) = (cid:104)eik·(rj (t)−rj (0))(cid:105) is the
applying j = l condition, ˜χself
self-intermediate scattering function. Fig.7 shows the ˜χ4(k, t) − ˜χself
4 (k, t) for the cation and
the anion in SCM at various temperatures. The magnitude of the wavevector is set by

j=1

k = 2π/λmax, where λmax is the shortest peak position of radial distribution function be-
tween the cation and the anion. The overall functional form of ˜χ4(k, t)− ˜χself
4 (k, t) is similar
with χ4(t), while the peak at short time scale is more pronounced. The crossover behavior

for the maximum point of ˜χ4(k, t) also can be found in the inset of Fig.7.

In order to obtain the length scale of the dynamic heterogeneity, we calculate the dynamic

ρ(q, t) =

(9)

(10)

where q = |q|. The dynamic correlation length, ξ4(t), is obtained by ﬁtting the small
wavevector regime into the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation,

i=1

S4(q, t) =

S4(q = 0, t)
1 + (qξ4(t))2 ,

(11)

where, S4(0, t) and ξ4(t) are ﬁtting parameters. S4(q, t) is ﬁtted in the regime of q ≤ 1.5
which is corresponding to the condition, 4.19 ≤ r ≤ 17.88. Obtained correlation length is
shown in Fig.8 at various temperature and time. Similar to the dynamic heterogeneity, the

correlation length is also transient in time. At ﬁrst, the correlation length is growing until it

reaches the maximum, and then it decreases. The functional form of the correlation length

resembles that of χ4(t), however, the time values that the peaks occur are not identical.

Analogous to the previous studies on the supercooled liquids, the time for which ξ4(t) is
maximum is larger than t∗
4.35,48 From this result, we ﬁnd that the characteristic time scale
of the correlation length is longer than the time scale of the dynamic heterogeneity.

We now investigate the power law relations between the dynamic physical quantities we

calculated. In various model systems of the supercooled liquids, the scaling law has been

found for the dynamic length and time scales.36,58–61 It is noted that these kinds of relations

are originally found in the critical behavior of phase transitions. In our ionic liquid model
system, a similar power law relation is discovered. First, we show the relation between t∗

Interestingly, this crossover behavior is prominent in SCM and ACM which include the

article, τβ is deﬁned by the minimum value of d(ln(cid:104)δr2(t)(cid:105))/d(lnt), where δr = r(t) − r(0).
This means that τβ is the time value of the plateau of mean-squared displacement at each

temperature. The mean-squared displacement and its derivative of the cation in SCM is

shown in Fig.12. As the temperature is lowered, τβ increases until it reaches maximum

value of t = 2. Note that our deﬁnition of τα and τβ allows τβ to be longer than τα at the

high temperatures.τα and τβ are also marked in Q(t)/N , Fig.5. Note that τα is a time scale

of the structural relaxation, while τβ is a time scale of plateau of Q(t)/N .

In this sense, τβ can be interpreted as a characteristic time scale that particles stay in

the cage. When the temperature is high, β-relaxation regime is not clearly observed in

the time correlation function Q(t)/N . However, at the low temperature, slowing down of

local dynamics due to the cage eﬀect makes β-relaxation regime distinctive. The onset

temperature of this phenomenon is related to the onset of the crossover behavior. When

ξ4(t) is calculated at t = τβ, the cations and the anions of SCM and ACM have the power
law exponent γ ∼ 2 (Fig.11). However, when t = t∗
4 ∼ τα, the exponent is much larger at
low temperatures. Such phenomenon is not found in the UCM system since the cage eﬀect

of uncharged system is weak compared to the charged systems. The evidence of enhanced

cage eﬀect in SCM and ACM can be found in the behavior of Q(t)/N , Fig.5. For SCM

and ACM, Q(t)/N show highly stretched form and the plateau is clearly observed at short

time. However, the plateau in Q(t)/N of UCM is not profound compared to SCM and ACM

cases. From this observation, we argue that the existence of the charges on the particles

strengthens the cage eﬀect around certain particle. Furthermore, this enhanced cage eﬀect

causes the crossover behavior in the power law relation. This crossover behavior observed

more profoundly in SCM and ACM can be thought as a distinguishing property of ionic

liquids in our model systems.

ACM ∼ 4.1, and
When we compare the values of the exponent γ, we ﬁnd γC

highly ordered compared to the structure of uncharged system. Meanwhile, the diﬀerence

between two charged system, SCM and ACM, is not profound.

In spite of the diﬀerent

charge distributions of the cation, the crossover behavior is very similar for two systems and

the exponents of the power law between the correlation length and the characteristic time

scale of the dynamic heterogeneity have similar values.

Finally, we demonstrate the three ﬁtting schemes to ﬁnd the relation between t∗

4 and ξ∗

These ﬁtting schemes have diﬀerent theoretical bases. First, mode-coupling theory predicts

functional forms.

It seems that the power law relation is most appropriate to describe

the data at long length scale. The other two functions show similar exponential behavior.

At short length scales, it seems that the exponential function well matches to the data.

However, the data at short length scales are governed by a diﬀerent physical environment

and it may be a coincidence that the functions agree with the data. Note that diﬀerent

behavior of short length regime is due to the cage eﬀect of ionic liquid model. It is notable

that Flenner et al. reported that there is a universal behavior of supercooled liquids which
is an exponential relation between t∗

4 and ξ∗

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the previous works, heterogeneous dynamics has been found in RTILs using the theo-

retical schemes which are applied to supercooled liquids. In this study, we ﬁnd the evidences

of heterogeneous dynamics in the simple ionic liquids models. As the temperature decreases,

displacement distribution of the cation and the anion is getting broaden as shown in Fig.2(a)

and Fig.2(d). It seems that the broadening of the distribution reaches its maximum when

the time is comparable to the relaxation time of each model system. Furthermore, the de-

coupling of the mean exchange time and the mean persistence time is observed. At low

temperatures, the mean persistence time is growing much faster than the mean exchange

time as expected from the previous studies.7,23 From the result, we can infer that the deﬁned

excitation events are correlated each other at suﬃciently low temperatures, which is caused

by the correlated local motion of the particles.

We adopt the four-point correlation function analysis to study how the local densities

are correlated in our ionic liquids model systems. To quantify the heterogeneous dynamics,

the dynamic susceptibility is calculated based on two diﬀerent time-correlation functions

which are Q(t)/N and Fs(k, t). The time dependence and the temperature dependence of

calculated dynamic susceptibility, χ4(t) and ˜χ4(t), are investigated. Our results illustrate

that the dynamic heterogeneity found in RTILs is transient in time analogous to the situation

in the supercooled liquids.

We also successfully extract the dynamic correlation length, ξ∗

4, and the dynamic correlation length, ξ∗

4, by ﬁtting the dynamic
structure factor, S4(t), into the Ornstein-Zernike equation. Calculated quantities such as
the characteristic time scale of the dynamic heterogeneity, t∗
4, the maximum value of the
dynamic susceptibility, χ∗
4, are connected via the
4 ∼ 1
power law relations at low temperatures. Interestingly, the crossover behavior around t∗
4 ∼ 1 is prominent in the charged model, SCM and ACM. We count this phenomenon
and ξ∗
on the enhanced cage eﬀect due to the existence of charge. The crossover behavior and the
peak of the dynamic susceptibility in the short time region t ∼ τβ are not noticeable in the
UCM and in the previous studies on the glassy systems. Note that, in the Ref 6, the power

The power law exponents, ζdh, were found to be the same in all the models studied in this

work. In this study, on the other hand, the power law exponents related with the length

scale of the dynamic heterogeneity, θ and γ, show diﬀerent values depending on the models.

As we vary the charge distributions on the cation particle, the eﬀect of diﬀerent charge

distributions on the glassy dynamics is observed. When the result of UCM is compared with

the charged model systems, all three models show the heterogeneous dynamics at suﬃciently

low temperatures. Even if the particles do not have the charge, the mixture of diﬀerent shape

of particle shows the glassy behavior like other supercooled liquids models. The existence of

charge on the particles mainly aﬀects two aspects of the system. First, the onset temperature

of heterogeneous dynamics increases. Because the structures of the charged systems are more

stable than the structure of UCM at the same temperature, the dynamics is much slower

and the temperature which shows heterogeneous dynamics is much higher. Second, the cage

eﬀect is enhanced. From the simulation results of dynamic susceptibility and the power

law analysis, we conﬁrm that the alternating local structure of the cations and the anions

results strong cage eﬀect. As a result, we ﬁnd crossover behavior for the power law relation

between the time scale and the length scale of the dynamic heterogeneity. Furthermore, the

comparison between SCM and ACM reveals that the asymmetric charge distribution makes

the system more fragile. However, two models basically show similar behaviors except the

onset temperature of the dynamic heterogeneity.

The simple models we used are designed to reveal heterogeneous dynamics which can

be observed in RTILs. Because of their simplicity, a clear comparison of diﬀerent models is

possible and relatively long and large simulation is available compared to the all-atom models

of RTILs. While the models can provide the insight on the role of the charge distributions on

the cations, they are highly coarse-grained models so that the eﬀect of the molecular details

are ignored. In order to extend the models to more realistic systems, detailed molecular

structure can be considered. In the future study, less coarse-grained model such as 4-atom

cation model7 may be used for investigation of the dynamic heterogeneity in RTILs.
