Abstract

We propose an approach to solve the stochastic neutron point kinetics equations us-
ing an adaptation of the diagonalization-decomposition method (DDM). This new approach
(Double-DDM) yields a nonstiﬀ solution for the stochastic formulation, allowing the calcula-
tion of the neutron and precursor densities at any time of interest without the need of using
progressive time steps. We use Double-DDM to compute results for stochastic problems
with constant, linear, and sinusoidal reactivities. We show that these results strongly agree
with those obtained by other approaches established in the literature. We also compute and
analyze the ﬁrst four statistical moments of the solutions.

Keywords: point kinetics, stochastic moments, stiﬀness, decomposition method

1. Introduction

The neutron point kinetics equations (Hetrick, 1971; Kinard and Allen, 2004; Hayes and Allen,

2005) are the coupled diﬀerential equations for the neutron density and for the delayed neu-
tron precursor concentrations. These equations model the time-dependent behavior of a
nuclear reactor and provide insight into the dynamics of its operation. The time-dependent
parameters in this system are the reactivity function and the neutron source term.

The neutron density and delayed neutron precursor concentrations vary randomly with
time; however, the point kinetics equations are deterministic and can only be used to estimate
average values. Random ﬂuctuations in the neutron density and precursor concentrations can
be signiﬁcant at low power levels (Hurwitz Jr et al., 1963a,b), which points to the importance
of estimating these variations.

Hayes and Allen (2005) have generalized the standard deterministic point kinetics equa-
tions, deriving a system of stochastic diﬀerential equations that model the random behavior

of the neutron density and the precursor concentrations in a point reactor. Due to the
issue of stiﬀness, this system was implemented numerically using a stochastic piecewise con-
stant approximation method (Stochastic PCA). Work performed by Saha Ray (2012) has
shown that order 1.5 strong Taylor and Euler-Maruyama numerical methods are valid com-
putational alternatives to Stochastic PCA in solving the stochastic point kinetics equations.
However, with the exception of cases modeled with either none or only one group of neutron
precursors, the stiﬀness of the problem remains.

In this paper we propose to solve this stochastic formulation using a double decompo-
sition approach based on the diagonalization-decomposition method (DDM) decribed by
Wollmann da Silva et al. (2014). This proposed method is the major novelty and principal
contribution of this work, yielding a nonstiﬀ solution for the stochastic point kinetics equa-
tions. Speciﬁcally, this approach allows the calculation of the neutron and precursor densities
at any time of interest without the need of using progressive time steps. This solution is
obtained with a minimal amount of numerical approximations of the model; the largest nu-
merical eﬀort lies in the truncation of the decomposition and the integrations required by
DDM.

The major caveat in this approach is that convergence of DDM is yet to be proven. For
this reason, a Lyapunov criterion (Boichenko et al., 2005) is used to guarantee convergence
(cf. Petersen et al., 2011; Wollmann da Silva et al., 2014). We present computational results
for problems with constant, linear, and sinusoidal reactivities. The results of the proposed
method are compared against those of other approaches established in the literature, showing
strong agreement. We also compute the ﬁrst four statistical moments of the solutions.

This work is an expanded version of a recent conference paper (Wollmann da Silva et al.,
2015). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we present a
brief review on the key aspects of DDM. In Section 3 we formulate the stochastic point
kinetics equations. We introduce the proposed double decomposition approach in Section 4.
Numerical results are given in Section 5 for problems with constant (Section 5.1) and time-
dependent (Section 5.2) reactivities. The paper concludes in Section 6 with a discussion of
the work presented.

2. The Diagonalization-Decomposition Method (DDM)

Following Wollmann da Silva et al. (2014), one can obtain an analytical representation
for the solution of the neutron point kinetics equations that is free of stiﬀness. The neutron
point kinetics equations with six groups of precursors and time-dependent reactivity ρ(t) are
written as:

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

for i = 1, 2, ..., 6. Here, n(t) is the neutron density; Ci(t) is the density of the ith delayed
neutron precursor group; λi is the decay constant for a speciﬁc group i; Λ represents the

2

neutron mean generation time; and βi represents the delayed-neutron fraction in a speciﬁc

group i. The total fraction of delayed neutrons is given by β =

βi.

Pi=1

A recursive scheme with ﬁnite recursive depth R is used to obtain a solution. The
truncation index is determined with exponential convergence by the Lyapunov criterion
(Boichenko et al., 2005; Petersen et al., 2011), evaluated after each recursion step. The
neutron population and the precursors concentration are written in terms of the solution
from a recursion initialization (j = 0) and the respective correction terms (j > 0) for an
appropriate R ∈ N:

since the initial condition from Eqs. (2.1) is fully absorbed in Eq. (2.5a). The integral in
Eq. (2.5b) is evaluated using the Gauss-Legendre method.

A ﬂowchart describing the implementation of this method is given in Fig. 1. The solution
is obtained in an analytical representation that may be evaluated for any time value (free of
stiﬀness).

3. The Stochastic Formulation

Hayes and Allen (2005) derived a system of Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equations that
model the dynamics of the neutron density and the delayed neutron precursors in a point
nuclear reactor. This formulation describes the variation of the population and can be
interpreted as a balance between deaths, births, and transformations of neutrons in the
system. The probabilities of these events are determined by the physical parameters of
the model, such as the total and partial delayed neutron fraction; the fraction of delayed
neutrons of each precursor group; the decay constant of each group; and the average number
of neutrons produced in each ﬁssion.

Assuming a time interval small enough such that only one event occurs, one can write

4. The Proposed Method (Double-DDM)

We propose to solve the stochastic formulation in Section 3 by adapting the recursive
method described in Section 2. This approach yields a nonstiﬀ solution to the stochastic
system in Eqs. (3.1).

Since the matrix ˆB depends on both the neutron populations and the delayed neutron
concentrations, we resort to a double decomposition to obtain a solution for this problem:

I. Using DDM as described in Section 2, Eq. (3.1a) is solved for ˆB = 0; this yields the

deterministic solution Y (t) = Yd(t);

II. Yd(t) is used to determine the matrix ˆB for a sequence of discrete time steps (its

components are constant in each time step);

III. ˆB

1

2 is obtained through diagonalization ( ˆB is symmetric);

IV. Since Q(t) is known for a speciﬁc time interval, a decomposition scheme analogue to

DDM is applied:

d
dt
d

Y0(t) − ΩY0(t) = 0 ,

Yj(t) − ΩYj(t) = Ξ(t)Yj−1(t) + F (t) ,

(4.1a)

(4.1b)

where F(t) = Q(t) + ˆB

1

2 d
dtW (t) are constants known in each time step.

The total number K of stochastic components “drawn” in this approach is deﬁned by
the Central Limit Theorem (CLM) to guarantee a small statistical error for the ﬁrst four
moments. For all results shown in this paper, K is large enough to guarantee a statisti-
cal error smaller than 0.05% with 95% conﬁdence. The ﬂowchart in Fig. 2 describes the
implementation of the proposed method.

5. Numerical Results

In this section we present numerical results for the Double-DDM approach proposed in
Section 4 for examples with (i) constant and (ii) time-dependent reactivities. We compare
these results against those obtained with other approaches established in the literature. We
calculate the expected value E(Y ) and variance Var(Y ), given by

E(Y ) =

which gives us further insight on the behavior of the stochastic solutions.

5.1. Constant Reactivity

In the following examples we present the results of four methods established in the lit-
erature: Monte Carlo and Stochastic PCA (Hayes and Allen, 2005); order 1.5 strong Taylor
and Euler-Maruyama (Saha Ray, 2012). These results are reproduced here as they were
reported in the aforementioned references.

We compare these results with those obtained with the deterministic diagonalization-
decomposition method (DDM) and with the Double-DDM approach. The solutions of the
deterministic DDM are obtained by solving Eq. (3.1a) with ˆB = 0; we point out that this is
also the ﬁrst step of Double-DDM.

5.1.1. Step-reactivity insertion: one precursor

This example does not model an actual physical nuclear reactor problem. Nevertheless,
considering only one group of precursors implies that the stiﬀness of the problem disappears;
this provides a simple computational solution that is useful for a ﬁrst comparison with other
methods.

The physical parameters are λ1 = 0.1, β = β1 = 0.05, ν = 2.5, q = 200, Λ = 2

3, and
ρ(t) = − 1
3 for t ≥ 0. The initial condition is Y (0) = [400, 300]T . The expected values and
standard deviations of n(t) and C1(t) at time t = 2 are presented in Table 1 for each of the
methods.

A total of K = 1, 000 histories were accumulated for the Double-DDM approach. Skew-
ness and excess kurtosis for the neutron density were found to be γ1(n(2)) = −1 × 10−10 and
γ2(n(2)) = 3 × 10−11. The fact that γ1 and γ2 are nearly zero implies that the distribution
of stochastic solutions is symmetric and has Gaussian-like peak and tail.

It can be seen that there exists a close agreement between Double-DDM and the results
obtained with Monte Carlo and Stochastic PCA. Euler-Maruyama and order 1.5 strong

6

Taylor (Taylor 1.5) yield slightly higher results, very close to those obtained with the deter-
ministic DDM.

5.1.2. Step-reactivity insertion: six precursors

The following two examples model step-reactivity insertions for a thermal nuclear reactor.
In this case, we consider a stiﬀ system of equations with six precursor groups. The set of
physical parameters is taken from Kinard and Allen (2004): ν = 2.5, Λ = 0.00002, q = 0,
and β = 7 × 10−3, with βi and λi given in Table 2. The initial condition is given by

We collected K = 1, 000 histories for the subcritical step-reactivity ρ(t) = 0.003. Skew-
ness was found to be γ1(n(0.1)) = −1 × 10−7, and excess kurtosis γ2(n(0.1)) = 1.3 × 10−9.
For the critical step-reactivity ρ(t) = 0.007, K = 5, 000 histories were collected. Skew-
ness and excess kurtosis were computed respectively as γ1(n(0.001)) = −1.02 × 10−7 and

7

γ2(n(0.001)) = 1.15 × 10−8. These results for the third and fourth moments indicate that
the distribution of the stochastic solutions is symmetric and has neither a sharp peak nor a
heavy tail.

As in the previous example, the results obtained with Double-DDM are in close agreement
to the results from Monte Carlo and Stochastic PCA. The results from Euler-Maruyama and
order 1.5 strong Taylor are closer to those of deterministic DDM.

5.2. Time-Dependent Reactivity

The current literature lacks numerical results for the stochastic system in Eq. (3.1a) with
time-dependent reactivities. For this reason, the results collected from the literature and
reproduced next represent only the deterministic solution (with ˆB = 0). Although not ideal,
this approach allows us to verify that the expected value obtained with Double-DDM closely
agrees with well established models for problems with time-dependent reactivities. All the
following examples take into account six precursor groups.

5.2.1. Linear reactivity ρ(t) = at

The following two examples model a ramp reactivity ρ(t) = at for a thermal nuclear
reactor. The physical parameters considered are: Λ = 0.00001, n(0) = 1.0, and β = 6.403 ×
10−3, with βi and λi taken from Lewins (1978) and given in Table 4.

(Aboanber and Nahla, 2002) and the generalization of the analytical exponential model
(GAEM), as reported by Nahla (2008).

The number of histories collected for the case a = 0.25 was K = 15, 738. We computed the
higher moments for time t = 1.0, ﬁnding the standard deviation σ(n(1)) = 0.978, skewness
γ1(n(1)) = −3.02 × 10−7, and excess kurtosis γ2(n(1)) = −1 × 10−7. For the case a = 0.5,
we collected K = 27, 523 histories, and found σ(n(1)) = 1.11345, γ1(n(1)) = −2.15 × 10−6,
γ2(n(1)) = −3 ×10−8. This shows that, in both cases, the distribution of stochastic solutions
is nearly normal.

Double-DDM shows good agreement with the other methods shown in Table 5. The
results obtained with Double-DDM are slightly larger for the ﬁrst case (a = 0.25), and
slightly smaller for the second case. The relative diﬀerences are around 1% or smaller, being
well within 1 standard deviation.

5.2.2. Sinusoidal reactivity ρ(t) = b sin(t)

The last example simulates a case with sinusoidal reactivity ρ(t) = b sin(t), with b =
0.00073, Λ = 0.00003, and n(0) = 1.0. The total fraction of delayed neutrons is given by
β = 6.473 × 10−3, with βi and λi shown in Table 6.

We collected K = 2, 934, 237 histories to achieve the requirement imposed for the statis-
tical error (less than 0.05% with 95% conﬁdence). The higher moments for time t = 10 yield
σ(n(10)) = 1.3242, γ1(n(10)) = −0.0048, and γ2(n(10)) = −0.013. These results indicate (i)

a very small asymmetry in the distribution of stochastic solutions, with a slightly larger left
tail; and (ii) a very small yet noticeable “ﬂatter” peak when compared to a normal.

In general, Double-DDM closely agrees with the other methods presented here for com-
parison. Results displayed in Table 7 show that Double-DDM yields slightly smaller results
than those attained with the other methods. This can be conﬁrmed in Fig. 3, which de-
picts the average behavior of the stochastic solution compared to the deterministic solution
(DDM). These diﬀerences are, once again, very small (≈ 1%), and well within 1 standard
deviation.

6. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we propose an approach to solve the stochastic neutron point kinetics equa-
tions with a solution procedure that is free of stiﬀness. This is achieved through an adapta-
tion of the diagonalization-decomposition method (DDM) introduced in Wollmann da Silva et al.
(2014), wich provides a nonstiﬀ solution for the deterministic point kinetics equations. DDM
uses the Laplace transform to obtain a formal solution, then applies a decomposition into a
recursive scheme, using Gauss-Legendre integration.

The essential steps of the proposed approach (Double-DDM) are: (i) the deterministic
problem is solved with DDM; (ii) the deterministic solution is used to build the stochas-
tic component; (iii) another decomposition scheme analogue to DDM is used to solve the
stochastic system. This allows the calculation of the neutron density and precursor concen-
trations at any time of interest, without the need to resort to progressive time steps. The
elimination of stiﬀness comes from the fact that the evolution of the solution by recursion
adds correction terms to the whole time interval of interest in each step, and simultaneously
for each term that depends on a speciﬁc time scale.

Since convergence of DDM is yet to be proven, a Lyapunov criterion is used to guarantee
convergence. The results of the proposed method are compared against results obtained
through other approaches established in the literature. This comparison shows close agree-
ment for problems with constant step-reactivity insertions, as well as time-dependent ramp
reactivity and sinusoidal reactivity insertions.

In the current literature, the stochastic problem is mainly solved for constant reactivities;
numerical solutions are limited to feasible time intervals due to the stiﬀness inherent to the
problem. The mitigation of the stiﬀness character in solving the stochastic formulation is
the major novelty and principal contribution of this work. Moreover, the analysis of the
third and fourth moments of the stochastic solutions is, to the best of our knowledge, new.
The analyzed moments still depend on the size of the sample set and on the frequency with
which the stochastic ﬂuctuations are applied. In principle, an adjustment such as variance
reduction and its consequences for higher moments could yield more realistic results.
It
would be necessary to ﬁnd a reference scale in order to obtain such results independently
of the sample size or frequency of application. This still needs to be identiﬁed, as well as a
necessary ingredient to mimic reactor ﬂuctuations. These tasks are left for future work.
