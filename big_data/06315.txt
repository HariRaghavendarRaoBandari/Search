ALF GRAVITATIONAL INSTANTONS AND COLLAPSING RICCI-FLAT

METRICS ON THE K3 SURFACE

LORENZO FOSCOLO

Abstract. We construct large families of new collapsing hyperkähler metrics on the K3 surface.
The limit space is a ﬂat Riemannian 3–orbifold T 3/Z2. Away from ﬁnitely many exceptional points
the collapse occurs with bounded curvature. There are at most 24 exceptional points where the
curvature concentrates, which always contains the 8 ﬁxed points of the involution on T 3. The
geometry around these points is modelled by ALF gravitational instantons: of dihedral type (Dk)
for the ﬁxed points of the involution on T 3 and of cyclic type (Ak) otherwise.

The collapsing metrics are constructed by deforming approximately hyperkähler metrics obtained
by gluing ALF gravitational instantons to a background (incomplete) S1–invariant hyperkähler
metric arising from the Gibbons–Hawking ansatz over a punctured 3–torus.

As an immediate application to submanifold geometry, we exhibit hyperkähler metrics on the
K3 surface that admit a strictly stable minimal sphere which cannot be holomorphic with respect
to any complex structure compatible with the metric.

1. Introduction

Soon after Yau’s proof of the Calabi Conjecture showed that the (smooth 4–manifold underlying
a complex) K3 surface carries Kähler Ricci-ﬂat metrics, Gibbons and Pope [18] suggested the
construction (further explored by Page in [36]) of explicit approximately Ricci-ﬂat metrics on
Kummer surfaces. They considered the quotient of a ﬂat 4–torus by an involution and resolved the
16 orbifold singularities by gluing in copies of the Eguchi–Hanson metric. This Kummer construction
was later made rigorous by Topiwala [39] and LeBrun–Singer [26] using twistor methods. Much more
recently Donaldson [16] gave a diﬀerent proof using analysis, closest to the approach taken in the
current paper.

From a broader perspective the Kummer construction furnishes the prototypical example of
the appearance of orbifold singularities in non-collapsing sequences of Einstein 4–manifolds. In [1,
Theorem C] Anderson showed that a sequence of Einstein 4–manifolds (Mi, gi) with a uniform
lower bound on volume and upper bounds on diameter and Euler characteristic converges (up to
subsequences) to an Einstein 4–orbifold M∞ with ﬁnitely many singular points. The formation of
orbifold singularities is modelled on complete Ricci-ﬂat ALE spaces which appear as rescaled limits,
or “bubbles”, of the sequence (Mi, gi) around points that approach one of the singularities of the
orbifold M∞.

In the Ricci-ﬂat case collapsing can also occur. Anderson [2, Theorem II] showed that every
sequence of Ricci-ﬂat metrics (M, gi) of unit volume but unbounded diameter collapses everywhere,
i.e. injgi(x) → 0 for all x ∈ M . The collapse is in the sense of Cheeger–Gromov outside ﬁnitely
many points x1, . . . , xn, i.e. injgi(x) → 0 and injgi(x)2|Rmgi|gi(x) ≤ ǫ0 for all x ∈ M \ {x1, . . . , xn},
for a universal constant ǫ0 > 0. In fact, Cheeger and Tian [10, Theorems 0.1 and 0.8] have shown
that the collapse occurs with bounded curvature away from a deﬁnite number of points.

Contrary to the case of orbifold singularities, almost nothing is known about the structure of the
singular points arising in collapsing sequences of Ricci-ﬂat metrics [3, §6]. One would expect that
the geometry around these points is modelled on complete Ricci-ﬂat manifolds with non-maximal
volume growth. A simple example of the expected phenomena was suggested by Page [37] in 1981.
Consider the Kummer construction of Ricci-ﬂat metrics on the K3 surface along a family of split
tori T 4 = T 3 × S1
ℓ with a circle factor of length ℓ → 0. We can then think of the 2–spheres arising in

the resolution of the 16 singularities of T 4/Z2 as coming in pairs aligned along the collapsing circle
over each of the 8 singular points of T 3/Z2. If we now rescale the sequence of Kähler Ricci-ﬂat
metrics on the K3 surface by ℓ−2 around one of these pairs, Page suggests, in the limit ℓ → 0 we
should obtain a complete Ricci-ﬂat (hyperkähler) metric on a noncompact space which at inﬁnity
looks like (R3 × S1)/Z2.

In this paper we regard this example as a simple case of a more general construction of sequences
of Ricci-ﬂat metrics on the K3 surface that collapse to a 3–dimensional limit. In this more general
construction, the 4–torus T 3 × S1
ℓ is replaced by a non-trivial circle bundle over a (punctured)
3–torus and the role of Page’s “periodic but nonstationary gravitational instanton” is played by
other ALF gravitational instantons.

A gravitational instanton is a complete hyperkähler 4–manifold with decaying curvature at in-
ﬁnity. Since every hyperkähler manifold is in particular Ricci-ﬂat, gravitational instantons have
constrained volume growth: the volume of a geodesic ball of radius r grows at most as r4. Grav-
itational instantons of maximal volume growth are the ALE spaces constructed and classiﬁed by
Kronheimer [25] following earlier work of Eguchi–Hanson, Gibbons–Hawking and Hitchin. We have
seen how ALE spaces arise as models for the formation of orbifold singularities of non-collapsed

sequences of Einstein 4–manifolds. In [34] Minerbe showed that if Vol(cid:0)Br(p)(cid:1) = O(ra) for some

3 ≤ a < 4 and all p, then we must have a = 3. Gravitational instantons of cubic volume growth
are called ALF. By [34] the (unique) end of an ALF space looks like a circle ﬁbration over the
complement of a ball in R3 or R3/Z2 with ﬁbres of asymptotically ﬁnite length. If the base of
the circle ﬁbration at inﬁnity is R3 (respectively, R3/Z2) then we say that the ALF space is of
cyclic (dihedral) type, since the boundary of large geodesic balls is diﬀeomorphic to S3/Γ, where
Γ ⊂ SU (2) is a cyclic group in the ﬁrst case and a binary dihedral group in the second.

The prototypical example of an ALF space of cyclic type is the Taub–NUT metric on R4. This
metric is explicit and the circle ﬁbration at inﬁnity is induced by the Hopf projection S3 → S2. The
ﬁrst example of an ALF metric of dihedral type was found by Atiyah–Hitchin [5] by studying moduli
spaces of magnetic monopoles on R3, i.e. the solutions of the dimensional reduction of the Yang–
Mills self-duality equations from 4 to 3 dimensions. The Atiyah–Hitchin manifold is diﬀeomorphic
to the complement of a Veronese RP2 in S4 and the metric is explicitly given in terms of elliptic
integrals.

Recently ALF gravitational instantons have been the focus of intense research with the aim of
constructing and classifying examples. Minerbe [35] classiﬁed ALF spaces of cyclic type. These
are all explicitly given by the Gibbons–Hawking construction of hyperkähler 4–manifolds with a
triholomorphic circle action [19]. Most (if not all) the known methods of construction of hyperkähler
metrics have been applied to the dihedral ALF case: twistor methods [12,23], hyperkähler quotient
constructions [14], gauge-theoretic constructions as in the case of the Atiyah–Hitchin manifold [12],
Kummer-type constructions [8] and complex Monge–Ampère methods [6, 7]. For example, Page’s
“periodic but nonstationary” gravitational instantons of [37], more commonly known as D2 ALF
spaces, were ﬁrst constructed rigorously by Hitchin [23] using twistor methods and more recently by
Biquard–Minerbe [8] using an extension of the Kummer construction to non-compact spaces. The
D2 ALF spaces can also be thought of as the moduli spaces of centred charge 2 SO(3) monopoles
on R3 with two singularities endowed with their natural L2–metric [13]. The fact that all these
constructions yield equivalent families of ALF metrics was shown only recently by Chen–Chen [11].
Despite this rich theory of ALF gravitational instantons, until now it has remained unclear how
they can appear as models for the formation of singularities in collapsing sequences of hyperkähler
metrics on the K3 surface. The aim of this paper is to exploit singular perturbation methods to
construct examples of Ricci-ﬂat metrics on the K3 surface collapsing to a 3–dimensional limit and
exhibit ALF gravitational instantons as the “bubbles” appearing in the process.

Theorem 1.1. Every collection of 8 ALF spaces of dihedral type M1, . . . , M8 and n ≤ 16 ALF
spaces of cyclic type N1, . . . , Nn satisfying

χ(Mj) +

8Xj=1

nXi=1

χ(Ni) = 24

arises as the collection of “bubbles” forming in a sequence of hyperkähler metrics on the K3 surface
which collapse to T 3/Z2 with bounded curvature away from n + 8 points.

We refer to Theorem 6.15 for a more precise statement.
In [20] Gross–Wilson studied hyperkähler metrics on elliptic K3 surfaces with ﬁbres of small
size. They considered the generic case when all singular ﬁbres (24 of them) are of Kodaira type I1
(i.e. a pinched torus). The hyperkähler metric is approximated by a semi-ﬂat metric on the locus
of the smooth ﬁbres and by a certain (incomplete) explicit hyperkähler metric, the Ooguri–Vafa
metric, in the neighbourhood of each singular ﬁbre. As the size of the ﬁbres converges to zero, the
K3 surface collapses to a metric on S2 (the base of the elliptic ﬁbration) with 24 singular points.
To the knowledge of the author, besides Gross–Wilson’s work, Theorem 1.1 is the only study of
collapsing sequences of hyperkähler metrics on the K3 surface.

Now, one way to make precise Page’s observations in [37] about the Kummer construction for
a degenerating family of tori is to consider a gluing construction in which one glues 8 copies
of the D2 ALF space to the Z2 quotient of the trivial circle bundle T 3 × S1 over the ﬂat 3–
torus. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is also based on a gluing construction. In order to allow for
more general ALF spaces to appear as rescaled limits, the main idea is to replace T 3 × S1 with
an (incomplete) background hyperkähler metric on a non-trivial circle bundle over a punctured
3–torus. The tool to construct such a background metric is the Gibbons–Hawking construction
of hyperkähler metrics with a triholomorphic S1 symmetry, i.e. an isometric circle action that
also preserves the 2–sphere of complex structures compatible with the metric. The S1–invariant
hyperkähler metrics we seek are explicitly given in terms of a positive harmonic function h on T 3
with prescribed singularities at a ﬁnite number of points. For most conﬁgurations of punctures the
harmonic function h becomes negative somewhere. However, by multiplying h by a small number
ǫ > 0 (which geometrically corresponds to making the circle ﬁbres have small length) it is possible
to construct highly collapsed hyperkähler metrics ggh
ǫ outside of an arbitrarily small neighbourhood
of the punctures. Furthermore, the construction of this background metric can be made invariant
under the action of an involution.

The key observation now is that the asymptotic model of any ALF metric (up to a double cover in
the dihedral case) can be written in Gibbons–Hawking coordinates. By choosing the conﬁguration
of punctures appropriately it is then possible to glue in copies of ALF spaces to extend the Gibbons–
Hawking metric ggh
to an approximately hyperkähler metric gǫ: close to a ﬁxed point of the Z2–
ǫ
action on T 3 we glue in an ALF space of dihedral type (this explains why we need 8 of them
in Theorem 1.1); close to a puncture which is not a ﬁxed point of the Z2–action we glue in an
ALF space of cyclic type. The Euler characteristic constraint in the statement of Theorem 1.1 is
necessary for the resulting 4–manifold to have the same Euler characteristic as the K3 surface,
but it can also be reinterpreted as the necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of the
harmonic function h in the ﬁrst place.

The approximate solution gǫ is then deformed into an exact hyperkähler metric by means of
the Implicit Function Theorem. Since some of the ALF spaces are not biholomorphic to their
asymptotic model outside a compact set, it is necessary to set up the problem as a gluing problem
for hyperkähler structures, rather than the most standard procedure (as in the classical Kummer
construction) of ﬁrst constructing a complex surface using complex geometry and then solving a
complex Monge–Ampère equation on this given complex manifold.

Remark. At least in some form this “Gibbons–Hawking approximation” of hyperkähler metrics on
the K3 surface seems to be known to physicists in the context of the duality between M theory

compactiﬁed on the K3 surface and Type IIA String theory compactiﬁed on T 3/Z2. For example, in
[38] Sen discusses the physical interpretation of dihedral ALF spaces thought of as a “superposition”
of Taub–NUT spaces and the Atiyah–Hitchin manifold, cf. Remark 3.7.

Remark. One can also wonder what happens when we start from an arbitrary orientable ﬂat 3–
manifold instead of a 3–torus. There are 6 of these: in the notation of [41, §3.5] they are G1 = T 3,
Gi = T 3/Zi for i = 2, 3, 4, G5 = T 3/Z6 and G6 = T 3/(Z2 × Z2). Only G1 has b1 = 3, b1(Gi) = 1
in all other cases except for G6 which has purely torsion ﬁrst homology [29, Equation (2.5)]. By
working on the 3–torus equivariantly with respect to a ﬁnite group action, the Gibbons–Hawking
construction then yields (incomplete) Ricci-ﬂat metrics on circle bundles over a punctured ﬂat 3–
manifold M which are hyperkähler only when M = T 3, Kähler if M = Gi for i = 2, 3, 4, 5 and have
generic holonomy when M = G6. Moreover, Luft–Sjerve [29, Theorem 1.1] have shown that only
G1, G2 and G6 admit an involution with ﬁnitely many ﬁxed points (8, 4 and 2 of them, respectively).
Hence only in these 3 cases are we able to construct background Ricci-ﬂat metrics that can be
extended to complete metrics by gluing in copies of ALF spaces of cyclic and dihedral type. On the
other hand, Hitchin [22, Theorem 1] showed that the only Ricci-ﬂat 4–manifolds covered by the K3
surface are the Enriques surfaces (quotients of a K3 surface by an involution without ﬁxed points)
with their Kähler Ricci-ﬂat metrics and the quotient of an Enriques surface by an anti-holomorphic
involution without ﬁxed points. Carrying out our gluing construction equivariantly with respect
to a ﬁnite group action then allows us to produce collapsing sequences of Ricci-ﬂat metrics on
an Enriques surface (the metrics are Kähler in this case) and its quotient by an anti-holomorphic
involution: the collapsed limit is G2/Z2 and G6/Z2, respectively, and ALF gravitational instantons
appear as “bubbles”.

We leave aside for future work the question of understanding the relation between the metric
degenerations described in this paper and degenerations of a compatible complex structure on the
K3 surface. Similarly, it would be very interesting to understand to what extent the collapsing
behaviour exhibited in this paper is typical of an arbitrary sequence of Ricci-ﬂat metrics on the K3
surface collapsing to a 3–dimensional limit.

We give instead an application of our gluing construction to the theory of minimal surfaces.
It is well known that holomorphic submanifolds of a Kähler manifold minimise volume in their
homology class. A classical problem in minimal surface theory is to understand to what extent
area minimising surfaces (and more generally stable minimal surfaces) in Kähler manifolds must
be (anti)holomorphic. For example, in 1993 Yau asked whether it is possible to classify all stable
minimal 2–spheres in a simply connected Kähler Ricci-ﬂat manifold [42, Question 64]. In [32]
Micallef showed that every stable minimal surface in a ﬂat 4–torus must be holomorphic for some
complex structure compatible with the metric. For some time there was hope to prove a similar
result in the case of the K3 surface endowed with a hyperkähler metric. Eventually, Micallef–
Wolfson [31] showed that this is not the case. A simple application of our gluing construction
allows us to give an alternative (simpler) counterexample: there exist hyperkähler metrics on the
K3 surface that admit a strictly stable minimal sphere which is not holomorphic with respect to
any complex structure compatible with the metric, cf. Theorem 7.1.

Plan of the paper. As we have already mentioned, in this paper we will need to glue hyperkähler
structures rather than solving a complex Monge–Ampère equation on a given complex manifold.
In Section 2, following Donaldson [15], we explain how to set up the problem of deforming approx-
imately hyperkähler metrics based on the notion of deﬁnite triples.

Section 3 is a detailed summary of the theory of ALF spaces: we give precise deﬁnitions, describe

detailed asymptotics for such metrics and recall the construction and classiﬁcation of examples.

In Section 4 we use the Gibbons–Hawking ansatz to construct (incomplete) hyperkähler metrics
on circle bundles over a punctured 3–torus. In Section 5 we use ALF spaces of cyclic and dihedral

type together with the metrics constructed in Section 4 to produce families of approximately hy-
perkähler metrics. In Section 6 we use analysis to deform these approximate solutions into exact
hyperkähler metrics. This is done by means of an Implicit Function Theorem in weighted Hölder
spaces. As usual in gluing problems, most of the work goes into showing that the relevant linear
operator has no small eigenvalues as ǫ → 0 and the geometry degenerates.

Finally, Section 7 contains the proof of Theorem 7.1 about the existence of non-holomorphic

strictly stable minimal spheres.

2. Definite triples and hyperkähler structures on 4–manifolds

The standard approach in the Kummer construction of Kähler Ricci-ﬂat metrics on the K3 surface
is to proceed in two steps. First one constructs a complex surface with vanishing ﬁrst Chern class
by blowing up the singularities of a ﬂat orbifold T 4/Z2. On this given complex manifold one then
constructs a Kähler Ricci-ﬂat metric by solving a complex Monge-Ampère equation. Some of the
building blocks we are going to use in the gluing construction of this paper are not biholomorphic
to their asymptotic model outside a compact set. This will force us to adopt a diﬀerent strategy
and glue hyperkähler structures all together. In this initial preliminary section we explain how
Donaldson [15] suggested an approach to this problem, based on the notion of deﬁnite triples.

Recall that the space of 2–forms on an oriented 4–dimensional vector space carries a natural

non-degenerate bilinear form of signature (3, 3).

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let (M 4, µ0) be an oriented 4–manifold with volume form µ0. A deﬁnite triple is
a triple ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3) of 2–forms on M such that Span(ω1, ω2, ω3) is a 3–dimensional positive
deﬁnite subspace of Λ2T ∗

x M at every point x ∈ M .

Given a triple ω of 2–forms on (M, µ0) we consider the matrix Q ∈ Γ(cid:0)M, Sym2(R3)(cid:1) deﬁned by

1
2 ωi ∧ ωj = Qij µ0.

(2.2)

ω is a deﬁnite triple if and only if Q is a positive deﬁnite matrix.

To every deﬁnite triple ω we associate a volume form µω by

(2.3)
and the new matrix Qω = (det Q)− 1
3 Q which satisﬁes (2.2) with µω in place of µ0. Note that the
volume form µω and the matrix Qω are independent of the choice of volume form µ0. We refer to
µω and Qω as the associated volume form and intersection matrix of the deﬁnite triple ω.

µω = (det Q)

1

3 µ0

Now, let (M 4, µ0) be an oriented 4–dimensional manifold. It is well known that the choice of a
3–dimensional positive deﬁnite subspace of Λ2T ∗
x M for all x ∈ M is equivalent to the choice of a
conformal class on M . Thus every deﬁnite triple deﬁnes a Riemannian metric gω by requiring that
Span(ω1, ω2, ω3)|x = Λ+T ∗

x M for all x ∈ M and dvgω = µω.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A deﬁnite triple ω is said

(i) closed if dωi = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3;
(ii) an SU (2)–structure if Qω ≡ id;

6

L. FOSCOLO

(iii) hyperkähler if it is both closed and an SU (2)–structure.

The metric gω associated to a hyperkähler triple is hyperkähler, in the sense that it has holonomy

contained in Sp(1) ≃ SU (2).

2.1. The deformation problem. In Section 5 we will construct closed deﬁnite triples ω which
are approximately hyperkähler, in the sense that the intersection matrix Qω is close to the identity.
We now explain how to formulate the problem of deforming such a triple ω into a hyperkähler
structure.

Let ω be a closed deﬁnite triple on a 4–manifold M and assume that kQω − idkC 0 < σ for some
small σ > 0. We want to deform ω into a hyperkähler triple, i.e. we look for a triple of closed
2–forms η = (η1, η2, η3) on M such that

(2.5)

1
2 (ωi + ηi) ∧ (ωj + ηj) = δij µω.

Decompose η into self-dual and anti-self dual parts η = η+ +η− with respect to gω. The self-dual

part can be written in terms of a M3×3(R)–valued function A by

η+
i =

3Xj=1

Aij ωj.

Denote by η− ∗ η− the symmetric (3 × 3)–matrix with entries ( 1

2 η−

i ∧ η−

j )/µω. Then we can

rewrite (2.5) as

(2.6)

Qω + Qω AT + A Qω + A Qω AT + η− ∗ η− = id.

Now, consider the map

M3×3(R) −→ Sym2(R3);

A 7−→ Qω AT + A Qω + A Qω AT

and its diﬀerential A 7→ Qω AT + A Qω. Since Qω is arbitrarily close to the identity, this linear map
induces an isomorphism Sym2(R3) → Sym2(R3) for σ suﬃciently small. We can therefore deﬁne a
smooth function F : Sym2(R3) → Sym2(R3) such that Qω AT + A Qω + A Qω AT = S if and only
if A = F(S).

Remark. When ω is hyperkähler (thus Qω = id) the kernel of A 7→ Qω AT + A Qω corresponds to
inﬁnitesimal hyperkähler rotations.

Hence we reformulate (2.6) as

(2.7)

η+ = F(cid:16)(id − Qω) − η− ∗ η−(cid:17) .

Now, let H+

ω be the space of self-dual harmonic 2–forms with respect to gω. If a solution of (2.6)
exists on a compact manifold M then M must be either a 4–torus or a K3 surface with the standard
orientation and therefore H+
ω is 3–dimensional. Since ω1, ω2, ω3 are closed and self-dual (therefore
harmonic) and linearly independent (since ω is a deﬁnite triple) we deduce that H+
ω consist of
constant linear combinations of ω1, ω2, ω3.

By Hodge theory with respect to gω we can ﬁnally rewrite (2.7) as the elliptic equation

(2.8)

d+a + ζ = F(cid:16)(id − Qω) − η− ∗ η−(cid:17) ,

d∗a = 0,

for a triple a of 1–forms on M and a triple ζ ∈ H+
part of da.

ω ⊗ R3. Here 2 d+a = da + ∗da is the self-dual

Remark. Note that in general it is necessary to deform the cohomology classes of ω1, ω2, ω3 since
every hyperkähler triple must satisfy

1
2 h [ωi] ∪ [ωj], [M ] i = δij Volgω (M ).

ALF GRAVITATIONAL INSTANTONS AND COLLAPSING RICCI-FLAT METRICS ON THE K3 SURFACE

7

The linearisation of (2.8) is

(2.9)

where D is the Dirac-type operator

(D ⊕ id) ⊗ R3 : (cid:16)Ω1(M ) ⊕ H+

ω(cid:17) ⊗ R3 −→(cid:16)Ω0(M ) ⊕ Ω+(M )(cid:17) ⊗ R3,

(2.10)

D = d∗ ⊕ d+ : Ω1(M ) −→ Ω0(M ) ⊕ Ω+(M ).

Note that the operator in (2.9) is always surjective with kernel consisting of harmonic 1–forms.

3. ALF gravitational instantons

In this section we collect known results about gravitational instantons of type ALF, with an
emphasis on their asymptotic geometry. ALF gravitational instantons will appear as local models
for the geometry of high curvature regions in sequences of hyperkähler metrics on K3 collapsing to
a 3–dimensional limit.

A gravitational instanton is a complete hyperkähler 4–manifold (M, g) with decaying Rieman-
nian curvature at inﬁnity. The minimum requirement (automatically satisﬁed for rescaled limits of
Einstein metrics on 4–manifolds with bounded Euler characteristic by the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet
formula) is that (M, g) has ﬁnite energy kRmkL2. In order to say something about the structure of
gravitational instantons it has often been necessary to strengthen this ﬁnite energy assumption to
faster than quadratic curvature decay |Rm| = O(r−2−ǫ), ǫ > 0 (or a slightly weaker ﬁnite weighted
energy assumption). Note however that there are examples of gravitational instantons which do
not satisfy this stronger decay assumption [21, Theorem 1.5].

Since hyperkähler manifolds are in particular Ricci-ﬂat, gravitational instantons have only one
end and constrained volume growth: the volume of a geodesic ball of radius r can grow at most as
r4 and at least linearly. An initial rough classiﬁcation of gravitational instantons can be given
in terms of their volume growth. The gravitational instantons of maximal volume growth are
the ALE spaces classiﬁed by Kronheimer [25] following earlier work of Eguchi–Hanson, Gibbons–
Hawking and Hitchin. Under the assumption of faster than quadratic curvature decay (or a slightly
weaker ﬁnite weighted energy assumption) Minerbe [34, Theorem 0.1] has shown that if we as-

sume Vol(cid:0)Br(p)(cid:1) = O(ra) for some 3 ≤ a < 4 and all p, then a = 3. Minerbe also described the

asymptotic geometry of gravitational instantons of cubic volume growth and faster than quadratic
curvature decay: they are all ALF spaces, in the following sense.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A gravitational instanton (M, g) is called ALF if there exists a compact set
K ⊂ M , R > 0 and a ﬁnite group Γ < O(3) acting freely on S2 such that M \ K is the total
space of a circle ﬁbration π : M \ K → (R3 \ BR)/Γ and the metric is asymptotically a Riemannian
submersion

(3.2)

g = π∗gR3/Γ + θ2 + O(r−τ )

for a connection θ on π and some τ > 0. There are two possibilities for the ﬁnite group Γ: if Γ = id
we say that M is an ALF gravitational instanton of cyclic type; if Γ = Z2 we say that M is an ALF
gravitational instanton of dihedral type.

We are interested in reﬁning these asymptotics. In order to describe a more precise model for
the end of an ALF gravitational instanton it is necessary to recall the explicit construction of
4–dimensional hyperkähler metrics with a triholomorphic circle action known as the Gibbons–
Hawking ansatz. We will use this same ansatz later in the paper to construct (incomplete) hyper-
kähler metrics on circle bundles over a punctured 3–torus.

3.1. The Gibbons–Hawking ansatz. The Gibbons–Hawking ansatz describes 4–dimensional hy-
perkähler metrics with an isometric S1–action that also preserves the whole hyperkähler structure.
Such an S1 action is therefore called triholomorphic.

Let U be an open set of R3 and π : P → U be a principal U (1)–bundle. Suppose that there
exists a positive harmonic function h on U such that ∗dh is the curvature dθ of a connection θ on
P . Then

(3.3a)

ggh = h π∗gR3 + h−1θ2

is a hyperkähler metric. Indeed, we can exhibit an explicit hyperkähler triple ωgh that induces the
metric ggh. Fix coordinates (x1, x2, x3) on U ⊂ R3 and deﬁne

(3.3b)

ωgh
i = dxi ∧ θ + h dxj ∧ dxk.

Here and in the rest of the paper we use the convention that for every i = 1, 2, 3 the indices j, k
are chosen so that ǫijk = 1. One can check explicitly that ωgh deﬁnes an SU (2)–structure and it
induces the Riemannian metric ggh. Moreover, the requirement that ωgh is also closed is equivalent
to the abelian monopole equation

(3.4)

∗ dh = dθ

The ﬁbre-wise circle action on P preserves ωgh and π is nothing but a hyperkähler moment map
for this action. Conversely, every 4–dimensional hyperkähler metric with a triholomorphic circle
action is described by (3.3).

The basic example of the Gibbons–Hawking construction is given in terms of so-called Dirac
monopoles on R3. Fix a set of distinct points p1, . . . , pn in R3 and consider the harmonic function

h = λ +

nXj=1

kj

2|x − pj|

,

where λ > 0 and k1, . . . , kn are constants. Since R3 \ {p1, . . . , pn} has non-trivial second homology,
we must require kj ∈ Z for all j in order to be able to solve (3.4). If these integrality constraints are
satisﬁed then ∗dh deﬁnes the curvature dθ of a connection θ (unique up to gauge transformations)
on a principal U (1)–bundle P over R3 \ {p1, . . . , pn} which restricts to the principal U (1)–bundle
associated with the line bundle O(kj) → S2 on a small punctured neighbourhood of pj. The pair
(h, θ) is a solution of (3.4) which we call a Dirac monopole with singularities at p1, . . . , pn.

The Gibbons–Hawking ansatz (3.3) associates a hyperkähler metric ggh to every Dirac monopole
on the open set where h > 0. When kj > 0 then ggh is certainly deﬁned on the restriction of P to
a small punctured neighbourhood of pj. By a change of variables one can check that ggh can be
extended to a smooth (orbifold) metric modelled on C2/Zkj by adding a single point. In particular
ggh is a complete metric whenever λ ≥ 0 and kj = 1 for all j = 1, . . . , n. One can check that ggh
is an ALE metric when λ = 0 and an ALF metric of cyclic type when λ > 0. Note also that when
λ > 0 we can always rescale the metric so that λ = 1.

3.2. Families of ALF gravitational instantons. We are now going to use the Gibbons–Hawking
ansatz to deﬁne a reﬁned asymptotic model for ALF gravitational instantons.

Let H k be the total space of the principal U (1)–bundle associated with the line bundle O(k)
over S2 radially extended to R3 \ BR for any R > 0. θk will denote the SO(3)–invariant connection
on H k. The Gibbons–Hawking ansatz (3.3) yields a hyperkähler metric

triple deﬁned by (3.3b). Note that we could replace the harmonic function 1 + k
2ρ for
any λ > 0 but we can always reduce to the case λ = 1 by scaling.

2ρ with λ + k

Finally, on H 2k we consider the Z2–action which is deﬁned as the simultaneous standard involu-
tions on the base R3 and the ﬁbre. Here the involution on the ﬁbre S1 = R/2πZ is the one induced

ALF GRAVITATIONAL INSTANTONS AND COLLAPSING RICCI-FLAT METRICS ON THE K3 SURFACE

by the standard involution on the universal cover R. Throughout the paper we refer to this as the
standard involution of S1.

Deﬁnition 3.6. Let (M 4, g) be an ALF gravitational instanton of cyclic type. By scaling assume
that the length of the circle ﬁbres at inﬁnity is 1.

(i) We say that M is of type Ak for some k ≥ −1 if there exists a compact set K ⊂ M , R > 0

and a diﬀeomorphism φ : H k+1 → M \ K such that

|∇l

gk+1(gk+1 − φ∗g)|gk+1 = O(r−3−l)

for every l ≥ 0.

(ii) We say that M is of type Dm for some m ≥ 0 if there exists a compact set K ⊂ M , R > 0
and a double cover φ : H 2m−4 → M \ K such that the group Z2 of deck transformations is
generated by the standard involution on H 2m−4 and

|∇l

g2m−4(g2m−4 − φ∗g)|g2m−4 = O(r−3−l)

for every l ≥ 0.

By [11, Theorem 1.1] every ALF gravitational instanton is either of type Ak for some k ≥ −1
or Dm for some m ≥ 0 (the constraints k ≥ −1 and m ≥ 0 follow from [33, Theorem 0.1] and [8,
Corollary 3.2], respectively).

Remark. In the cyclic case Chen–Chen [11, Theorem 1.1] have a worse decay O(r−2) of an ALF
metric of type Ak to gk+1. However, from the explicit description of cyclic ALF gravitational
instantons as multi-Taub–NUT spaces, as we will recall below, it is clear that one can always
change coordinates by a translation on R3 so that every Ak ALF space satisﬁes the stronger decay
stated in Deﬁnition 3.6.(i).

3.2.1. ALF spaces of cyclic type. We saw that gravitational instantons of type Ak can be construc-
ted from Dirac monopoles on R3 with k + 1 singularities via the Gibbons–Hawking ansatz. These
are usually called multi-Taub–NUT metrics. The case k = 0 is the Taub–NUT metric on R4 and
k = −1 is R3 × S1 with its ﬂat metric. Minerbe [35, Theorem 0.2] has shown that every ALF space
of cyclic type must be isometric to a multi-Taub–NUT metric.

From their explicit description one can easily compute basic information about cyclic ALF spaces:
the fundamental group π1(M ), the second Betti number b2(M ), the Euler characteristic and the
dimension of the moduli space M of Ak metrics:

k > −1

Here we assume that the asymptotic length of the circle ﬁbre is normalised to be 1 so that dim(M)
does not include rescalings.

3.2.2. ALF spaces of dihedral type. ALF metrics of dihedral type are not globally given by the
Gibbons–Hawking construction and in most cases are not explicit. A number of diﬀerent construc-
tions have appeared over the past 30 years, but only recently Chen–Chen [11, Theorem 1.2] have
shown that all these constructions yield equivalent families of ALF metrics. We distinguish the
cases m = 0, 1, 2 and m ≥ 3.
m = 0: The D0 ALF manifold is the moduli space of centred charge 2 monopoles on R3 with its
natural L2–metric, known as the Atiyah–Hitchin manifold. The metric admits a cohomo-
geneity one isometric action of SU (2) and is explicitly given in terms of elliptic integ-
rals [5, Chapter 11]. The Atiyah–Hitchin manifold is diﬀeomorphic to the complement of a
Veronese RP2 in S4 and therefore it retracts to RP2. The Atiyah–Hitchin metric does not
admit deformations as a D0 ALF metric except for scaling.

10

L. FOSCOLO

m = 1: The double cover of the Atiyah–Hitchin manifold is a D1 ALF space. As a smooth manifold
it is diﬀeomorphic to the complement of RP2 in CP2, or equivalently to the total space
of O(−4) over S2. Exploiting the rotational invariance of the metric it can be shown [30,
Proposition 5.5] that the 2–sphere in the interior is a strictly stable minimal sphere which
is not holomorphic with respect to any complex structure compatible with the metric, a
fact that will play a crucial role in the proof of Theorem 7.1. This rotationally invariant D1
ALF metric admits a 3–dimensional family of D1 ALF deformations, sometimes referred
to as the Dancer metrics.

Remark. The fact that the double cover of the Atiyah–Hitchin manifold admits a 3–parameter fam-
ily of D1 ALF deformations can also be shown using methods similar to the ones developed in this
paper. Indeed, it is known [24, §5.4] that the rotationally invariant D1 ALF metric admits a unique
L2–integrable (in fact, exponentially decaying) anti-self-dual harmonic form η. This form yields
a 3–dimensional space of inﬁnitesimal hyperkähler deformations and an extension of the analysis
needed for the proof of Theorem 6.15 could be used to integrate these inﬁnitesimal deformations to
genuine D1 ALF metrics. In fact Dancer [14] has constructed a 3–parameter family of hyperkähler
deformations of the rotationally invariant D1 ALF metric using Nahm’s equations and hyperkähler
quotient techniques: there exists a hyperkähler 8–manifold N constructed as a moduli space of
solutions to Nahm’s equations which admits a triholomorphic U (1)–action. Denote by µ : N → R3
the corresponding hyperkähler moment map. Dancer identiﬁes the rotationally symmetric D1 ALF
metric with the hyperkähler quotient µ−1(0)/U (1). By varying the level set of the moment map he
then obtains a 3–parameter family of hyperkähler deformations of the Atiyah–Hitchin metric. By
a general formula for the inﬁnitesimal deformation of the symplectic form of a symplectic quotient
corresponding to varying the level set of the moment map [17], the inﬁnitesimal deformations of
the Atiyah–Hitchin metric corresponding to Dancer’s metrics coincide with those determined by
the L2 harmonic form η, which is interpreted in this context as the curvature of the natural hy-
perholomorphic connection on the U (1)–bundle µ−1(0) → µ−1(0)/U (1) induced by the Levi–Civita
connection of N .

m = 2: D2 ALF metrics were constructed by Hitchin [23, §7] using twistor methods and by
Biquard–Minerbe [8, Theorem 2.4] using a non-compact version of the Kummer construc-
tion: one considers the quotient of R3×S1 by an involution and resolves the two singularities
gluing in copies of the Eguchi–Hanson metric.

Remark. Biquard–Minerbe [8, Theorem 2.4] use singular perturbation methods to solve a complex
Monge–Ampère equation on the minimal resolution of (R3 × S1)/Z2. Using the more general ap-
proach adopted in this paper to glue hyperkähler structures one could extend their construction to
recover a 6–dimensional family of D2 ALF metrics.

m ≥ 3: Dm ALF metrics (for all m ≥ 1) appeared in the work of Cherkis–Kapustin [13] on moduli
spaces of singular monopoles on R3 and were rigorously constructed by Cherkis–Hitchin [12]
using twistor methods and the generalised Legendre transform. In the case m ≥ 3 a more
transparent construction due to Biquard–Minerbe [8, Theorem 2.5] yields Dm ALF metrics
by desingularising the quotient of the Taub–NUT metric by the binary dihedral group Dm
of order 4(m − 2) using ALE dihedral spaces. Using complex Monge–Ampère methods
Auvray [6, 7] has then constructed 3m–dimensional families of Dm ALF metrics on the
smooth 4–manifold underlying the minimal resolution of C2/Dm.

Remark 3.7. The gluing construction presented in this paper could be extended to the non-compact
setting to yield yet another construction of dihedral ALF metrics. Indeed, one considers a Gibbons–
Hawking metric obtained from the harmonic function

for m distinct points x1, . . . , xm ∈ R3 \ {0}. Observe that for λ > 0 suﬃciently large h > 0 outside
an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the origin. Since the conﬁguration of punctures is invariant
under the standard involution of R3, this (incomplete) metric descends to a hyperkähler metric on
a Z2 quotient. For λ suﬃciently large one can then complete this metric by gluing in a copy of the
D0 ALF space close to the origin. This approximate solution could then be deformed to an exact
hyperkähler metric in a way similar to the proof of Theorem 6.15.

We summarise some of the properties of a Dm ALF gravitational instanton M in the following

4. Gibbons–Hawking ansatz on a punctured 3–torus

In this section we use the Gibbons–Hawking ansatz (3.3) to construct families {ggh

ǫ }ǫ>0 of (in-
complete) hyperkähler metrics on circle bundles over a punctured 3–torus modulo an involution.
The parameter ǫ > 0 essentially determines the length of the circle ﬁbres. As ǫ → 0 the metric ggh
ǫ
collapses to the ﬂat orbifold T 3/Z2 with bounded curvature away from the punctures. The family
{ggh
ǫ }ǫ>0 will serve as the model for a family of hyperkähler metrics on the K3 surface collapsing to
a 3–dimensional limit in the region where the collapsing occurs with bounded curvature. In the next
section we will use ALF gravitational instantons as models for high curvature regions to extend the
metric ggh
ǫ

to a complete almost hyperkähler metric.

4.1. Dirac monopoles on a punctured torus. Let T = R3/Λ be a 3–torus for some lattice
Λ ≃ Z3. Endow T with a ﬂat metric gT.

Let τ : T → T be the standard involution x 7→ −x on T and denote by q1, . . . , q8 its ﬁxed points.

For each j = 1, . . . , 8 choose a non-negative integer mj.

Fix a τ –symmetric conﬁguration of further 2n distinct points p1, τ (p1), . . . , pn, τ (pn). Sometimes

we will use the notation −pi for τ (pi). Denote by T∗ the punctured torus

T∗ = T \ {q1, . . . , q8, p1, τ (p1), . . . , pn, τ (pn)}.

Finally choose integer weights k1, . . . , kn > 0 and assume the following balancing condition holds:

(4.1)

In particular, n ≤Pn

i=1 ki ≤ 16.

mj +

ki = 16.

For each j = 1, . . . , 8 let ρj denote the distance function from the point qj with respect to gT.
Similarly, by abuse of notation we let ρi denote the distance function from ±pi in T/τ . By restricting
the branched double cover T → T/τ to a suﬃciently small ball centred at ±pi in T/τ we will also
regard ρi as the distance function on T from the point pi or τ (pi).

We look for a Dirac monopole (h, θ) on T∗ with the following singular behaviour: h is a harmonic

function on T∗ with prescribed singularities at the punctures
ki

as ρi → 0.

Proposition 4.3. Assume the balancing condition (4.1) is satisﬁed.

(i) There exists a harmonic function h on T∗ with prescribed singular behaviour (4.2) such
that ∗gTdh is the curvature dθ of a connection θ on some principal U (1)–bundle P → T∗.
(ii) The moduli space of Dirac monopoles (h, θ) on P is isomorphic to R × ˆT, where ˆT is the

dual torus parametrising ﬂat U (1)–connections on T.

12

L. FOSCOLO

(iii) The involution τ lifts to the involution ˜τ of the U (1)–bundle P which acts simultaneously

as τ on T∗ and as the standard involution on the circle ﬁbres.

Proof. The necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of the harmonic function h is

(4.4)

2mj − 4 + 2

8Xj=1

nXi=1

ki =

1

2π ˆ∂Tσ

∗dh = 0,

where Tσ denotes the complement of the union of small balls of radius σ centred at the punctures.
Thus if (4.1) is satisﬁed, a harmonic function h with the singular behaviour (4.2) does indeed exists
and is unique up to the addition of a constant.
By Lefschetz–Poincaré duality H2(T∗) ≃ H 1

c (T∗). The latter group sits in a long exact sequence

0 → H 0(T) → Z2n+8 → H 1

c (T∗) → H 1(T) → 0,

where Z2n+8 is generated by the 2n + 8 punctures. Thus H2(T∗) is (2n + 10)–dimensional and maps
onto H2(T) with kernel spanned by the classes of 2n + 8 spheres centred at the punctures. Note
that the sum of these 2n + 8 homology classes vanishes.

Because of (4.2), 2n+7 of the 2n+10 integrality constraints on i

2π ∗dh to represent the ﬁrst Chern
class of a line bundle are automatically satisﬁed since we chose 2mj − 4, ki ∈ Z. The remaining 3
constraints can be reinterpreted in terms of the position of the punctures following the arguments
in the proof of [9, Proposition 3.5]:

(2mj − 8) qj +

8Xj=1

nXi=1

ki(cid:0)pi + τ (pi)(cid:1) ∈ Λ.

Since the points qj belong to the half-lattice 1

2 Λ this condition is automatically satisﬁed.

We have therefore proved the existence of a principal U (1) bundle P → T∗ endowed with a
connection θ with curvature ∗dh. Since T is not simply connected θ is uniquely determined up to
a ﬂat connection, i.e. a point of the dual torus ˆT. This concludes the proof of (i) and (ii).

By uniqueness up to the addition of a constant the harmonic function h is τ –invariant and
therefore can be thought of as deﬁned on T∗/τ . Since τ ∗(∗dh) = − ∗ dh, we can lift τ (uniquely
up to gauge transformations) to an involution ˜τ of the circle bundle P by requiring that ˜τ acts
simultaneously as τ on T∗ and as the standard involution on the circle ﬁbres.
(cid:3)

4.2. Collapsed S1–invariant hyperkähler metrics. Fix once and for all a Dirac monopole
(h, θ) amongst the ones produced by Proposition 4.3. Via the Gibbons–Hawking ansatz (3.3) we
now use (h, θ) to construct (incomplete) hyperkähler metrics with a triholomorphic circle action
with orbits of small length.

Fix a (small) positive number ǫ > 0 and deﬁne

(4.5)

hǫ = 1 + ǫh.

The Gibbons–Hawking ansatz (3.3) yields a hyperkähler structure on P |Uǫ, where Uǫ is the open
set of T∗ where hǫ > 0. The hyperkähler triple ωgh

The following asymptotic expansions for the harmonic function hǫ close to the punctures are
standard. In the case of a ﬁxed point of the involution τ the improved decay follows from the fact
that linear harmonic functions on R3 are not Z2–invariant.

Lemma 4.7. There exists 0 < ρ0 < 1
B2ρ0(±pi), i = 1, . . . , n, in T are all disjoint and such that the following holds.

4 inj gT such that the balls B2ρ0(qj), j = 1, . . . , 8, and

(i) For j = 1, . . . , 8 there exists λj ∈ R such that in B2ρ0 (qj)

hǫ = (1 + ǫλj) +

ǫ(mj − 2)

ρj

+ O(ǫ ρ2

j ).

(ii) For each i = 1, . . . , n there exists λi ∈ R and a linear function ℓi on R3 with |ℓi| ≤ Cρ

such that in B2ρ0(±pi)

hǫ = (1 + ǫλi) +

ǫki
2ρi

+ ǫ ℓi + O(ǫ ρ2

i ).

Moreover, ρ0, λj, λi, ℓi depend continuously on the position of the punctures p1, . . . , pn and on the
ﬂat metric gT and f = O(ǫ ρ3) means that there exists a constant C depending continuously on
these data such that |∇kf | ≤ Cǫρ3−k for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.

Since we chose ki > 0 for i = 1, . . . , n certainly a punctured neighbourhood of ±pi is contained
in the set Uǫ where hǫ > 0. As already mentioned, the Gibbons–Hawking metric can be extended
by adding a single point to a smooth orbifold metric modelled on C2/Zki. The obvious way to
smooth out such an orbifold singularity is to replace the “multiplicity” ki point pi with ki points
each with weight 1. Then the Gibbons–Hawking ansatz yields a smooth metric that is modelled on
a rescaled Taub–NUT space in a neighbourhood of pi. However we prefer to leave the freedom to
choose ki > 1 so that we can consider conﬁgurations of punctures that “degenerate” as ǫ → 0 and
see an Aki−1 ALF space appearing as a rescaled limit.

Remark. One could also consider (but we will not pursue this in the paper) more general degen-
erating families of punctures with various clusters of points coalescing at diﬀerent rates as ǫ → 0.
One would expect “bubble trees” of ALF and ALE spaces appearing as rescaled limits in this case,
cf. [2, Remark 5.2].

ǫ

Next, we consider the structure of ggh
ǫ

in a neighbourhood of qj. By Lemma 4.7.(i) certainly hǫ is
positive in a punctured neighbourhood of qj whenever mj > 2. In this case the Gibbons–Hawking
metric on M gh
can be extended to a smooth orbifold metric with a singularity of the form C2/Dmj ,
where Dmj is the binary dihedral group of order 4(mj − 2). In contrast with the previous case, there
is no explicit way to remove this singularity, but for ﬁxed ǫ > 0 one can imagine using the methods
of [8, §2.4] to resolve this singularity by gluing in a rescaled ALE dihedral space. However, we are
interested in the limit ǫ → 0 and in the next section we will directly glue in a Dmj ALF space to
resolve this singularity.

Similarly, when mj = 2 one can choose ǫ suﬃciently small so that 1 + ǫλj > 0. Note that in
this case hǫ and the U (1)–bundle P are well deﬁned at qj. After quotienting by ˜τ , the Gibbons–
ǫ becomes an orbifold metric modelled on (R3 × S1)/Z2. As before, the two
Hawking metric ggh
orbifold singularities could be resolved by (i) ﬁxing ǫ > 0 and gluing in two copies of the Eguchi–
Hanson metric, or (ii) letting ǫ → 0 and gluing in a single copy of a D2 ALF metric. We will follow
the second approach.

Remark 4.8. Note that if mj = 2 for all j = 1, . . . , 8 then n = 0 by (4.1) and the bundle P
extends over every puncture: in fact P is a 4–torus and our construction reduces to the usual
Kummer construction along a family of 4–tori collapsing to a 3–dimensional torus. This is the case
considered by Page in [37].

It remains to study the case when mj = 0, 1 for some j. Assume this is the case for j = 1, . . . , k

case mj = 0, 1 is “bad” in the sense that hǫ → −∞ as ρj → 0.

In other words, by choosing ǫ small enough we can assume that hǫ > 0 outside an arbitrarily

small neighbourhood of the points q1, . . . , qk where mj = 0, 1.

Finally, we consider the limit ǫ → 0.

Lemma 4.10. As ǫ → 0 the harmonic function hǫ converges to the constant function 1. The
convergence is in C k,α on the complement of the union of balls of radius ǫβ around the punctures,
where β > 0 is any number such that β−1 > k + 1 + α. In particular, M gh

5. Approximate hyperkähler metrics

In this section we patch together ALF gravitational instantons and the incomplete hyperkähler
structure ωgh
ǫ of the previous section to construct a closed deﬁnite triple ωǫ which is approximately
hyperkähler. In the next section we will use analysis to deform ωǫ into a genuine hyperkähler
structure for each ǫ > 0 suﬃciently small.

5.1. The 4–manifold Mǫ. Let ωgh
ǫ be the hyperkähler triple deﬁned in (4.6). By Lemma 4.9
for ǫ > 0 small enough we think of ωgh
, a smooth manifold with boundary
obtained by restricting the line bundle P to the complement of (arbitrarily) small balls centred
at the punctures and then taking the quotient by the involution ˜τ . The boundary of M gh
has
n + 8 components, each of which has a collar neighbourhood diﬀeomorphic either to H 2mj −4/Z2
for j = 1, . . . , 8, or H ki for i = 1, . . . , n.

For each j = 1, . . . , 8 let Mj be the smooth 4–manifold underlying a Dmj ALF space and for
each i = 1, . . . , n let Ni be the smooth manifold underlying an Aki−2 ALF space. We construct a
smooth 4–manifold Mǫ by cutting the ends of Mj and Ni and gluing the resulting manifolds with
boundary to M gh

in a neighbourhood of qj or ±pi, respectively.

ǫ

We will construct an approximate hyperkähler structure on Mǫ in the next subsection. Here we
pause for a moment to determine the Betti numbers of Mǫ. While we will not use this result in an
essential way in the rest of the paper, it is interesting to note how the balancing condition (4.1)
appears naturally in the calculation of the Euler characteristic of Mǫ.

Proposition 5.1. The Betti numbers of the compact orientable 4–manifold Mǫ are

b1(Mǫ) = 0,

b+
2 (Mǫ) = 3,

b−
2 (Mǫ) = 22.

ALF GRAVITATIONAL INSTANTONS AND COLLAPSING RICCI-FLAT METRICS ON THE K3 SURFACE 15

Proof. Decompose Mǫ into the union of a piece P/˜τ , an Aki−1 ALF space for each i = 1, . . . , n and
a Dmj ALF space for each j = 1, . . . , 8. These pieces are identiﬁed along their common boundaries,
which are homology spheres. Since all components have vanishing ﬁrst Betti number, the reduced
Mayer–Vietoris sequence yields b1(Mǫ) = 0. The Euler characteristic is also easily calculated:

It remains to calculate the signature τ (Mǫ). Below we will construct a deﬁnite triple ωǫ on Mǫ
which is close to deﬁne a hyperkähler structure. By changing basis of Λ+T ∗Mǫ one can always
deform this triple to a genuine SU (2)–structure (without requiring any diﬀerential constraint). In
particular, Mǫ can be endowed with an almost complex structure J with c1(Mǫ, J) = 0. Since
c2(Mǫ, J) = χ(Mǫ) = 24, Hirzebruch’s Signature Theorem and the equality of characteristic classes
p1 = c2
(cid:3)

1 − 2c2 yield τ (Mǫ) = −16.

Remark. In Remark 4.8 we noted that the case where n = 0 and mj = 2 for all j = 1, . . . , 8 reduces
to the usual Kummer construction. Hence we know that Mǫ is diﬀeomorphic to the K3 surface in
this special case. It seems likely one can prove that the diﬀeomorphism type of Mǫ does not depend
on the conﬁguration of punctures satisfying the balancing condition (4.1). Since we are going to
construct a hyperkähler metric on Mǫ, the calculation of the Betti numbers will anyway imply that
Mǫ is always diﬀeomorphic to the K3 surface.

5.2. The deﬁnite triple ωǫ. We are now going to deﬁne an approximately hyperkähler triple ωǫ
on the 4–manifold Mǫ.

For each j = 1, . . . , 8 denote by ωqj,ǫ the hyperkähler triple obtained from the Gibbons–Hawking

ansatz (3.3) using the harmonic function

(5.2)

hqj = (1 + ǫλj) +

ǫ(mj − 2)

ρ

.

By abuse of notation we think of ωqj,ǫ as deﬁned both on the circle bundle H 2mj −4 → R3 \ B8ǫ(0)
as well as on its quotient by the involution that acts as the simultaneous standard involution on
R3 and the circle ﬁbres.

Similarly, for each i = 1, . . . , n let ωpi,ǫ be the hyperkähler triple obtained from the Gibbons–

Hawking ansatz using the harmonic function

(5.3)

hpi = (1 + ǫλi) +

ǫ ki
ρ

+ ǫ ℓi.

Here λj, λi and ℓi are the constants and linear functions appearing in Lemma 4.7. We will assume
that ǫ is small enough to guarantee that 1

2 < λi, λj < 3
2 .

For all j = 1, . . . , 8 let (Mj, ωMj ) be a complete Dmj ALF space. By Deﬁnition 3.6 there exists

a compact set K ⊂ Mj, R0 > 0 and a diﬀeomorphism Mj \ K ≃ H 2mj −4/Z2 such that

ǫ2ωMj = ωqj,ǫ + η

qj,ǫ

for ρ > ǫR0 with η

qj,ǫ = O(ǫ3ρ−3) and similar estimates on the derivatives.

For each i = 1, . . . , n let (Ni, ωNi) be a complete Aki−1 ALF space. By the classiﬁcation of
ALF spaces of cyclic type [35] the hyperkähler structure on Ni is explicitly given via the Gibbons–
Hawking ansatz starting from a harmonic function on R3 with ki singularities. We can add to
this function the smooth harmonic function ǫ2ℓi. Over a ball in R3 of radius much smaller than
ǫ−2 we can regard the resulting hyperkähler structure as a small perturbation of the ALF Aki−1
hyperkähler structure ωNi. By abuse of notation we denote this perturbed hyperkähler structure
with the same symbol ωNi. The advantage of this modiﬁcation is that now ǫ2ωNi approaches

16

ωpi,ǫ with a smaller error: by Deﬁnition 3.6 there exists a compact set K ⊂ Ni, R0 > 0 and a

Remark. The choice of perturbing the gravitational instanton Ni of type Aki−1 by adding a linear
function on R3 can be regarded as an intermediate choice between resolving the singularity of
M gh
. While
not strictly necessary, the choice of perturbing Ni by a linear function makes the exposition more
uniform. In particular, the closed deﬁnite triple we will construct below fails to be hyperkähler by
the same amount in a neighbourhood of qj and ±pi.

We will assume that ǫ is chosen so small as to make sure that ǫR0 ≪ ρ0, where ρ0 > 0 was ﬁxed
in Lemma 4.7. By choosing R0 larger if necessary we can assume that the harmonic functions hqj
and hpi in (5.2) and (5.3) are as close to constant functions as we please for ǫR0 ≤ ρ ≤ ρ0. Then
the hyperkähler triples ωqj,ǫ and ωpi,ǫ deﬁne metrics gqj,ǫ and gpi,ǫ which are uniformly equivalent
to gT + ǫ2θ2 in the regions ǫR0 ≤ ρj, ρi ≤ 2ρ0. In the rest of the section all norms and covariant
derivatives will be computed with respect to this metric.

A crucial observation is that we can take η

qj,ǫ to be exact.

Lemma 5.4.

(i) For all i = 1, . . . , n there exists a triple api,ǫ of 1–forms on H ki such that

|∇kapi,ǫ| ≤ Cǫ3(cid:18) 1

ρ(cid:19)2+k

and ǫ2ωNi = ωpi,ǫ + dapi,ǫ.

(ii) For all j = 1, . . . , 8 there exists a triple aqj ,ǫ of Z2–invariant 1–forms on H 2mj −4 such that

|∇kaqj,ǫ| ≤ Cǫ3(cid:18) 1

ρ(cid:19)2+k

and ǫ2ωMj = ωqj,ǫ + daqj,ǫ.

Proof. The proof is identical in the two cases. Set k = ki in case (i) and k = 2mj − 4 in case (ii).
In case (ii) we work with Z2–invariant forms on the double cover H 2mj −4.

By scaling we can assume that ǫ = 1. It is enough to prove that every closed 2–form η with

η = O(ρ−3) can be written as η = da with |∇ka| = O(ρ−2−k).

Since the restriction of H k to an exterior domain in R3 is diﬀeomorphic to (R, ∞) × Σ with Σ
an homology sphere, we can write η = dρ ∧ α + β for some ρ–dependent 1–form α and 2–form β
on Σ with |α| + |β| = O(ρ−3).

The condition dη = 0 implies ∂ρβ−dΣα = 0. We then deﬁne a = −´ ∞

ρ α. The Lemma follows. (cid:3)

By a similar radial integration, Lemma 4.7.(i) implies that in the regions ǫR0 ≤ ρj ≤ 2ρ0 and

6. Perturbation to hyperkähler metrics

In the previous section we have constructed a 4–manifold Mǫ together with a closed deﬁnite triple
ωǫ which is approximately hyperkähler in the sense that the intersection matrix Qǫ associated with
ωǫ diﬀers from the identity by arbitrarily small terms as ǫ → 0. We would like to deform ωǫ into
a genuine hyperkähler triple using analysis. Since the geometry of Mǫ degenerates as as ǫ → 0 we
need to take some care in applying the Implicit Function Theorem.

As explained in Section 2 we can reformulate the problem in terms of an elliptic PDE. Let gǫ be
ǫ the space of self-dual harmonic forms
ǫ, i = 1, 2, 3. The equation

the Riemannian metric on Mǫ deﬁned by ωǫ. Denote by H+
with respect to gǫ. By Proposition 5.1 H+
ǫ
we want to solve is (2.8), i.e.

is 3–dimensional spanned by ωi

d+a + ζ = F(cid:0)(id − Qǫ) − d−a− ∗ d−a(cid:1) ,

ǫ ⊗ R3.

d∗a = 0,

The linearisation of (6.1) is an isomorphism since b1(Mǫ) = 0 by Proposition 5.1. Our main task
is to show that its inverse has bounded norm as ǫ → 0 and to control the non-linearities in (6.1)
by introducing appropriate Banach spaces.

6.1. The linear operator d∗ + 2 d+ for collapsing Gibbons–Hawking metrics. Before intro-
ducing weighted Hölder spaces and proving the main estimates, it is helpful to look more closely
at the linearisation of (6.1). It involves the operator D = d∗ + 2 d+ : Ω1(Mǫ) → Ω0(Mǫ) ⊕ Ω+(Mǫ),
where adjoints and projections are computed using the metric gǫ.

We are interested in understanding the behaviour of the operator D (in particular, the presence

of small eigenvalues) for a sequence of collapsing metrics in the Gibbons–Hawking form (3.3a).

Consider then the metric

ggh
ǫ = hǫ gT + ǫ2h−1

ǫ θ2

of (4.6) over the circle bundle π : P → Uǫ ⊂ T∗. By Lemma 4.9 the open sets Uǫ form an exhaustion
of T∗ as ǫ → 0.

We ﬁrst consider the geometry of ggh
As before let θ1, θ2, θ3 denote closed 1–forms on T such that gT = θ2

3. Let ξ1, ξ2, ξ3 be
the dual vector ﬁelds with respect to gT. We will not distinguish between a vector tangent to T
and its horizontal lift to P with respect to the connection θ. In particular, [ξi, ξj] = −dθ(ξi, ξj) ξ as
vector ﬁelds on P . Finally, let ξ be the vertical vector ﬁeld normalised so that θ(ξ) = 1.

ǫ and in particular calculate its Levi–Civita connection.

2 + θ2

1 + θ2

Since θ([ξ, ξi]) = −dθ(ξ, ξi) = 0 and π∗[ξ, ξi] = [π∗ξ, ξi] = 0, we have [ξ, ξi] = 0. The Koszul

formula

2h∇X Y, Zi = h[X, Y ], Zi − h[Y, Z], Xi + h[Z, X], Y i + X · hY, Zi + Y · hX, Zi − Z · hX, Y i

then allows to calculate the Levi–Civita connection ∇ of the metric ggh

ǫ (cid:16)(ξj · hǫ) ξi − (ξi · hǫ) ξj − δij∇Thǫ(cid:17) .

∇ξj ξi = − 1

Here ∇T and ♯T denote gradient and musical isomorphism with respect to the ﬂat metric gT and
we used the fact that hǫ is S1–invariant. Since ∇ is a metric connection, we calculate the covariant
derivatives of the 1–forms θ, θi by duality. Since we will need this later, we write out formulas for
∇ξθ and ∇ξθi:

∇ξθ = 1

ǫ dhǫ,

∇ξθi = − 1

2 ǫ2h−3

ǫ (ξi · hǫ) θ + 1

Now, the cotangent bundle of M gh

ǫ

is trivial as it is spanned by θ, θ1, θ2, θ3. Thus we can write

every 1–form a as

(6.3)

a = ǫ a0 θ + a1 θ1 + a2 θ2 + a3 θ3

for functions a0, a1, a2, a3. Note that

|a|2

ǫ (cid:16)|a1|2 + |a2|2 + |a3|2(cid:17) .

A direct computation using the fact that θi is closed for i = 1, 2, 3 and (hǫ, ǫ dθ) is a solution of

the monopole equation (3.4) with respect to the ﬂat metric gT shows that

(6.4)

where ωgh

ǫ,i, i = 1, 2, 3, is the hyperkähler triple ωgh

ǫ of (4.6).

By Fourier analysis along the circle ﬁbres we deﬁne projections Π0 and Π⊥ onto S1–invariant
and oscillatory components of functions. Via the trivialisation (6.3) Π0 and Π⊥ extend to 1–forms.
Since hǫ is S1–invariant we see from (6.4) that the operator D respects this decomposition.

These two observations — the convergence of the operator D to the Dirac operator D0 of the
ﬂat 3–torus as ǫ → 0 and the strong control of the oscillatory part of 1–forms — will be crucial
in the rest of the section. We will exploit the same remarks when considering blow-downs of ALF
gravitational instantons. Let (M, gM ) be a complete ALF space. Given a sequence Ri → ∞ consider
the blow down R−2

Remark. The behaviour of natural diﬀerential operators (the Laplacian acting on p–forms, the Dirac
operator) associated with Riemannian metrics collapsing with bounded curvature and diameter have
been studied by many authors, cf. for example [27, 28]. The concrete situation we are interested in
is a simple case of this more general theory and it seemed more appropriate to exploit the explicit
nature of the Gibbons–Hawking metric rather than appealing to these more general results.

In order to control the growth of diﬀerential forms close to the punctures on T∗ and on the end

of an ALF space we will now introduce weighted Hölder spaces.

6.2. Weighted Hölder spaces. We work on the Riemannian 4–manifold (Mǫ, gǫ) constructed in
Section 5. The aim of this subsection is to introduce weighted Hölder spaces and prove a weighted
Schauder estimate for the operator D = d∗ + 2 d+ associated with the metric gǫ.

For R0 suﬃciently large and ǫ = ǫ(R0) suﬃciently small we deﬁne a weight function ρǫ as follows:

following weighted Schauder estimate.

δ(cid:19) .

Proof. In order to prove this estimate it is convenient to cut the manifold Mǫ in various pieces and
analyse the geometry separately in each of them. The global estimate follows by combining the
“local” estimates obtained in each of these pieces.

Consider ﬁrst the region ρj ≤ 2R0ǫ for some j = 1, . . . , 8. The rescaled metric ǫ−2gǫ is isometric

to a compact region in the Dmj ALF space (Mj, gMj ).

Now, given a 1–form a on Mǫ, restrict a to the region ρj ≤ 2R0ǫ and deﬁne ˜a = ǫ−1−δa. The

standard Schauder estimate for the elliptic operator D associated with the metric gMj is

k˜akC 1,α ≤ C (kD˜akC 0,α + k˜akC 0) .

Since |˜a|ǫ−2gǫ = ǫ−δ|a|gǫ and the norms ∇˜a and D˜a are related in a similar way to those of ∇a and
Da, the weighted Schauder estimate follows immediately.

The same argument can be applied in the region ρi ≤ 2R0ǫ: the role of Mj is now played by a

small perturbation (cf. the beginning of Section 5.2) of the Aki−1 ALF space Ni.

Consider now the transition region R0 ǫ ≤ ρj ≤ ρ0 for some j = 1, . . . , 8. We can work on the
double cover H 2mj −4 and restrict to Z2–invariant forms. Scaling by ǫ as above we reduce to consider
the restriction of H 2mj −4 to the region R0 ≤ ρ ≤ ρ0
ǫ

in R3 endowed with a metric

ρ

(cid:19) gR3 +(cid:18)1 + ǫλj +

θ2 + O(ρ−3) + O(ǫ3ρ2).

Moreover, after rescaling the weight function ρǫ coincides with the radial function ρ on R3.

Fix a number σ ∈ (0, 1). For each point x let π(x) be its image in R3 and set R = σρ(x). Up to
changing R0 and ρ0 into (1 − σ)R0 and (1 + σ)ρ0 we can assume that BR(π(x)) is contained in the
annulus R0 ≤ ρ ≤ ρ0
ǫ and that the restriction of H 2mj −4 to this ball is trivial. We can then work

ALF GRAVITATIONAL INSTANTONS AND COLLAPSING RICCI-FLAT METRICS ON THE K3 SURFACE 21

on a “square” BR × [−R, R] in the universal cover of H 2mj −4|BR. Rescaling the metric by R−2,
applying standard Schauder estimates, rescaling back and multiplying by R−δ we obtain

δ−1(BR) + kakC 0
The case of the region R0ǫ ≤ ρi ≤ ρ0 is completely analogous.
Finally, in the region where ρj, ρi ≥ 1

(BR) ≤ C(cid:18)kDakC 0,α

2 ρ0 the weight function ρǫ is uniformly equivalent to the
constant 1 and therefore weighted spaces coincide with standard Hölder spaces. Moreover the
harmonic function hǫ is C∞–close to the constant 1. The metric gǫ is therefore C∞–close to the
metric g∞ = gT + ǫ2θ2. The Schauder estimate for forms supported in this region is immediate since
we can restrict to small balls in the torus T on which the circle bundle P is trivial and then work
on the universal cover, which has bounded geometry.
(cid:3)

6.3. The linear estimate. We can now prove the main result about the linearisation of (6.1): the
operator D has uniformly bounded inverse.

that

By the Arzelá–Ascoli Theorem we can therefore assume that (fi, γi) converges to (f0, γ) ∈

(6.12)
on T. The control on kaikC 1,α

δ

∗ dγ + df0 = 0 = d∗γ

guarantees that |f0| + |γ| ≤ Cρδ close to the punctures.

We want to conclude that f0 is constant and γ is a smooth harmonic 1–form on T. By trivialising
the cotangent bundle of the 3–torus T by harmonic 1–forms θ1, θ2, θ3 we can write γ = f1θ1 + f2θ2 +
f3θ3. Then f0, f1, f2, f3 are harmonic functions on the punctured 3–torus with controlled blow-up
rate at the punctures. Since δ > −2, close to each puncture we must have fi = λi + ciρ−1 + O(ρ)
for some constants λi, ci. However, ci must vanish for all i = 0, 1, 2, 3 if (f0, fi) is a solution of the
ﬁrst order system (6.12) and not only of the second order PDE this implies. Hence the functions
fi are bounded harmonic functions on T and must be constant.

However, by Z2–invariance of the 1–forms ai the functions fi must be odd with respect to the
involution τ on T and must therefore vanish. Thus (f0, γ) = 0 and the Schauder estimate of
Proposition 6.10 implies that kaikC 1,α

By the Arzelá–Ascoli Theorem over every compact set of M we can extract a subsequence of

that a = 0. Indeed, the equation Da = 0 in particular implies that △a = 0. Since M is Ricci-ﬂat,
the Weitzenböck formula yields |a| △|a| ≤ 0 and therefore |a| = 0 by the maximum principle.

By varying all parameters involved in the construction we can in fact realise a whole open set in

the moduli space of hyperkähler metrics on the K3 surface. Indeed,

(i) the moduli space of ﬂat tori is 6–dimensional;
(ii) the choice of punctures p1, . . . , pn yields additional 3n parameters;
(iii) once the punctured torus and weights are ﬁxed, the moduli space of abelian Dirac mono-
poles with prescribed singularities is 4 dimensional (one has to choose ǫ and the 3–moduli
of a ﬂat connection);

(iv) each Dmj ALF space contributes 3mj parameters and every Aki−1 ALF space contributes

3(ki − 1) parameters.

7. Stable minimal surfaces

In this ﬁnal section we exploit our gluing construction of hyperkähler metrics on the K3 surface

to deduce some information about their submanifold geometry.

It is well known that holomorphic submanifolds of a Kähler manifold are volume minimising. It
is a classical problem in the theory of minimal submanifolds in Kähler manifolds to understand to
what extent volume minimising submanifolds must be holomorphic or anti-holomorphic.

ALF GRAVITATIONAL INSTANTONS AND COLLAPSING RICCI-FLAT METRICS ON THE K3 SURFACE 25

In [32] Micallef showed that every stable minimal surface in a ﬂat 4–torus must be holomorphic
with respect to a complex structure compatible with the metric. (Note however that this is no
longer the case for higher dimensional tori [4].) In view of Micallef’s result it was thought for some
time that a similar result could hold for the K3 surface endowed with a hyperkähler metric. Partial
results in this direction were established by Micallef–Wolfson [30, Theorem 5.3] and motivation for
the conjecture came from the fact that, given an arbitrary hyperkähler metric on the K3 surface,
every homology class can be represented by the sum of surfaces each of which is holomorphic with
respect to some complex structure compatible with the metric. However, Micallef–Wolfson [31] have
eventually shown that no analogue of the result for 4–tori holds for the K3 surface. Indeed they
found a class α ∈ H2(K3, Z) and a hyperkähler metric g on the K3 surface such that the volume
minimiser in α decomposes into a sum of branched minimal surfaces Σ1 ∪ · · · ∪ Σk not all of which
can be holomorphic with respect to some complex structure compatible with g.

We can use our gluing construction to construct further (simpler) examples of strictly stable
minimal spheres with respect to some hyperkähler metric on the K3 surface which cannot be
holomorphic for any complex structure compatible with the metric.

Theorem 7.1. There exist hyperkähler metrics on the K3 surface that contain a strictly stable
minimal sphere which is not holomorphic with respect to any complex structure compatible with the
metric.

Proof. In [30, Proposition 5.5] Micallef–Wolfson show that the double cover of the Atiyah–Hitchin
manifold, the rotationally symmetric D1 ALF space, contains a strictly stable minimal 2–sphere Σ
with [Σ] · [Σ] = −4. Since every holomorphic curve Σ of genus γ in a hyperkähler 4–manifold must
have [Σ]·[Σ] = 2γ −2 by the adjunction formula, this minimal 2–sphere cannot be holomorphic with
respect to any complex structure. One can also use the isometric action of SU (2) on the Atiyah–
Hitchin metric to prove this fact: the SU (2) action preserves the metric but rotates the complex
structures (equivalently, the hyperkähler triple) and the minimal 2–sphere is an SU (2)–orbit. Hence

the periods ´Σ ωi are forced to vanish.

Now, consider an approximate hyperkähler metric gǫ obtained in Section 5 by using the rota-
tionally symmetric D1 ALF space as one of the building blocks. Thus gǫ contains a strictly stable
minimal sphere Σ with [Σ] · [Σ] = −4.

Because of strict stability, Σ has no Jacobi ﬁelds. Then we can invoke White’s Implicit Function
Theorem for minimal immersions with respect to variations of the ambient metric [40, Theorem 2.1]
to deform Σ into a minimal immersion with respect to the hyperkähler metric produced by Theorem
6.15 starting from gǫ. As before, this minimal 2–sphere cannot be holomorphic with respect to any
complex structure because of its self-intersection number. It is strictly stable by continuity of the
spectrum of the Jacobi operator.
