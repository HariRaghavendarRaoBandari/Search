A BISHOP TYPE INEQUALITY ON METRIC MEASURE

SPACES WITH RICCI CURVATURE BOUNDED BELOW

YU KITABEPPU

Abstract. We deﬁne a Bishop-type inequality on metric measure spaces with
Riemannian curvature-dimension condition. The main result in this short
article is that any RCD spaces with the Bishop-type inequalities possess only
one regular set in not only the measure theoretical sense but also the set
theoretical one. As a corollary, the Hausdorﬀ dimension of such RCD∗(K, N )
spaces are exactly N . We also prove that every tangent cone at any point on
such RCD spaces is a metric cone.

1. Introduction

Ricci limit spaces are the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ limits of sequences of Riemannian
manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below. They are roughly classiﬁed
into two classes, collapsing and non-collapsing. For simplicity, we only consider
closed Riemannian manifolds in this section. Let {(Mn, gn)}n∈N be a sequence of
N -dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from
below and uniformly bounded diameters. By the Gromov compactness theorem,
we are able to ﬁnd a convergent subsequence {(Mnk , gnk )}k. We denote the Rie-
mannian volume measure of (Mn, gn) by voln. Let (Y, ν) be the limit space of such
subsequence {(Mnk , gnk )}, more precisely, of {(Mnk , gnk , volnk )}k where vol is the
normalized volume measure vol/vol(M ). Then we call (Y, ν) a non-collapsing Ricci
limit space if

lim
n→∞

voln(Mn) > 0,

and we call (Y, ν) a collapsing Ricci limit space if limn→∞ voln(Mn) = 0. On the
series of papers of Colding and Cheeger-Colding [8–11], it is proven that there are
many nice properties on non-collapsing Ricci limit spaces.

Theorem 1.1 ([8, 10, 11]). Let (Y, ν) be a non-collapsing Ricci limit space of a
sequence of N -dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Then

• dimH Y = N ,
• ν-almost every point has the unique tangent cone that is isometric to RN ,
• ν is absolutely continuous to HN on some nice regular set of full measure
• all the tangent cones are metric cones,
• (Y, ν) is rectiﬁable in the sense of Cheeger-Colding (see Deﬁnition 5.3 in

and vice versa,

[10]).

Compare with the collapsing and non-collapsing Ricci limit spaces.

Theorem 1.2 ([8, 10, 12]). Let (Y, ν) be a collapsing Ricci limit space of a sequence
of N -dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Then

• dimH Y ≤ N − 1,
• there exists an integer k with 1 ≤ k < N such that ν-almost every points

has the unique tangent cone that is isometric to Rk,

1

2

and vice versa,

• ν is absolutely continuous to Hk on some nice regular set of full measure
• (Y, ν) is rectiﬁable in the sense of Cheeger-Colding.

It is known that there is an example of collapsing Ricci limit space on which
there exists a point whose tangent cones are not metric cones (Example 8.95 in
[8]).

On the other hand, without using the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ approximation by Rie-
mannian manifolds, a concept of a metric measure space with lower Ricci curvature
bound is also deﬁned. Lott-Villani, Sturm have introduced the curvature-dimension
condition CD(K, N ) independently for the case K ∈ R, N = ∞ and K = 0,
1 < N < ∞ by [20], for any case by [24, 25]. They prove that any Ricci limit spaces
with ﬁnite total mass satisfy CD conditions. However Finsler manifolds with N -
Ricci curvature bounded below from K satisﬁes CD(K, N ) condition though generic
such manifolds are not Ricci limit spaces (see [22] for the deﬁnition of N -Ricci cur-
vature and the relation with CD condition, and see [8] for the relation of Ricci limit
spaces and Finsler manifolds). In order to rule out Finsler manifolds, Ambrosio-
Gigli-Savar´e introduce the Riemannian curvature-dimension condition RCD(K,∞)
for K ∈ R on metric measure space with ﬁnite mass [3] and with σ-ﬁnite mea-
sure [1]. Later Erbar-Kuwada-Sturm [13] and Ambrosio-Mondino-Savar´e [4] deﬁne
RCD∗(K, N ) condition for ﬁnite N ∈ (1,∞) independently, where ∗ means the
reduced curvature-dimension condition that is deﬁned by Bacher-Sturm [6] for the
tensorization property and the local-to-global property. Recently, Mondino-Naber
prove the nice local structures on ﬁnite dimensional RCD spaces [21].
Theorem 1.3 ([21, 25]). Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R and
N ∈ (1,∞). Assume supp m = X.Then

• dimH(X, d) ∈ (0, N ],
• for m-almost every point x ∈ X, there exists an integer k = kx with 1 ≤
k ≤ N such that the tangent cones are unique and isomorphic to Rk,
• (X, d, m) is rectiﬁable in the sense weaker than Cheeger-Colding’s one.

We denote by Rk the set of all points whose tangent cones are isomorphic to

k-dimensional Euclidean space, and by R = ∪kRk (see Deﬁnition 2.4).

Since RCD spaces are not deﬁned as limits of sequences of Riemannian mani-
folds, neither collapsing nor non-collapsing makes sense. In this article, we prove
the RCD spaces with Bishop-like inequalities behave like non-collapsing spaces.
More precisely, our main result is as follows.

Theorem 1.4 (Theorem 4.4, Corollary 4.5, Corollary 4.6, and Theorem 5.2). Let
(X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space with the generalized Bishop inequality BI(K, N ).
Assume supp m = X. Then

(1) R = RN ,
(2) on RN , the measure m is absolutely continuous to HN and vice versa,
(3) dimH(X, d) = N ,
(4) All tangent cones are metric cones.

Remark 1.5. The family of RCD∗(K, N ) spaces with the generalized Bishop in-
equality BI(K, N ) includes the family of non-collapsing Ricci limit spaces of appro-
priate curvature and dimension bounds. However these two classes do not coincide.
See Remark 5.3.

2. Preliminaries

A triplet (X, d, m) consisting of a complete separable metric space (X, d) and a
locally ﬁnite σ-compact positive Borel measure m on X is called a metric measure

space. Two metric measure spaces (X, d, m) and (Y, r, ν) are isomorphic if there
exists an isometry f : supp m → supp ν with f∗m = ν. A continuous curve γ :
[0, 1] → X is absolutely continuous if there exists an L1(0, 1) function g such that

d(γs, γt) ≤Z t

s

g(r) dr,

for any s ≤ t ∈ [0, 1].

For a continuous curve γ : [0, 1] → X, the metric derivative | ˙γ| is deﬁned by

| ˙γt| := lim

s→t

d(γt, γs)
|s − t|

as long as the right-hand side makes sense.
It is known that every absolutely
continuous curve has the metric derivative for almost every point [2]. We call an
absolutely continuous curve γ : [0, 1] → X a geodesic if | ˙γt| = d(γ0, γ1) for almost
every t ∈ [0, 1]. A metric space (X, d) is called a geodesic space if for any two points,
there exists a geodesic connecting them.
We denote the set of all Lipschitz functions on X by LIP(X). For f ∈ LIP(X),

the local Lipschitz constant at x, |∇f|(x), is deﬁned as
|f (x) − f (y)|

|∇f|(x) := lim sup

y→x

d(x, y)

if x is not isolated, otherwise |∇f|(x) = ∞. For f ∈ L2(X, m), we deﬁne the
Cheeger energy Ch(f ) as

Ch(f ) :=

n→∞ ZX |∇fn|2 dm ; fn ∈ LIP(X), fn → f in L2(X, m)(cid:27) .
Set D(Ch) := {f ∈ L2(X, m) ; Ch(f ) < ∞}. We deﬁne the Sobolev space
W 1,2(X, d, m) := L2(X, m) ∩ D(Ch) equipped with the norm kfk2

It is known that W 1,2 is a Banach space. We say that (X, d, m) is in-

We denote the set of all Borel probability measures on X by P(X). We deﬁne
P2(X) as the set of all Borel probability measures with ﬁnite second moment, that
is, µ ∈ P2(X) if and only if µ ∈ P(X) and there exists a point o ∈ X such that
RX d(x, o)2 dµ(x) < ∞. We call a measure q ∈ P(X × X) a coupling between µ and
ν if (p1)∗q = µ and (p2)∗q = ν, where pi : X × X → X are natural projections
for i = 1, 2. For two probability measures µ0, µ1 ∈ P2(X), we deﬁne the L2-
Wasserstein distance between µ0 and µ1 as

W2(µ0, µ1) := inf(cid:26)ZX×X

d(x, y)2 dq(x, y) ; q ∈ Cpl(µ0, µ1)(cid:27)1/2

,

where Cpl(µ0, µ1) is the set of all couplings of µ0 and µ1. The pair (P2(X), W2)
is called the L2-Wasserstein space, which is a complete separable geodesic metric
space if so is (X, d). We explain how geodesics in X relates to those in P2(X). We
denote the space of all geodesics in X by Geo(X), equipped with the sup distance.
Deﬁne the evaluation map et : Geo(X) → X for t ∈ [0, 1] by et(γ) = γt. Let
(µt)t ∈ Geo(P2(X)) be a geodesic connecting µ0, µ1 in P2(X). Then there exists a
probability measure π ∈ P(Geo(X)) such that (et)∗π = µt, by which we say that
the geodesic (µt)t can be lifted to π.

Let (Y, d) be a geodesic metric space and f : Y → R ∪ {±∞} a function on Y .
Deﬁnition 2.1 ([13]). A function f : Y → R ∪ {±∞} is said to be (K, N )-convex
for K ∈ R and N ∈ (1,∞) if for any two points y0, y1 ∈ Y , there exists a geodesic
(yt)t connecting them such that

Let (X, d, m) be a geodesic metric measure space. Consider µ = ρm ≪ m a
probability measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to m and its Radon-
Nikodym derivative being ρ. We deﬁne the relative entropy functional Entm by

Entm(µ) :=Z{ρ>0}

ρ log ρ dm,

whenever (ρ log ρ)+ is integrable, otherwise we deﬁne Entm(µ) = ∞.
Deﬁnition 2.2 ([13], cf. [4]). Let (X, d, m) be a geodesic metric measure space. We
say that (X, d, m) satisﬁes the entropic curvature-dimension condition CDe(K, N )
for K ∈ R and N ∈ (1,∞) if the relative entropy functional Entm is (K, N )-
convex. Moreover if (X, d, m) is inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian, (X, d, m) is called an
RCD∗(K, N ) space.

Under the inﬁnitesimal Hilbertianity condition, CDe(K, N ) is equivalent to

CD∗(K, N ).

2.2. Tangent cones and regular sets on RCD spaces. Let (X, d, m) be a
metric measure space. Take a point x0 ∈ supp m and ﬁx it. We call a quadruple
(X, d, m, x0) a pointed metric measure space. We say that a pointed metric measure
space (X, d, m, x0) is normalized if

Note that the pointed metric measure space (X, dr, mx

Let C(·) : [0,∞) → [1,∞) be a nondecreasing function. Deﬁne MC(·) the family

of pointed metric measure spaces (X, d, m, ¯x) that satisfy
m(B2r(x)) ≤ C(R)m(Br(x))

proven that there exists a distance function DC(·) : MC(·) ×MC(·) → [0,∞], which
induces the same topology as the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ one on MC(·) ([16]).
It is
known that every RCD∗(K, N ) space for given K ∈ R, N ∈ (1,∞) belongs to
MC(·) for a common function C(·) : (0,∞) → [1,∞) (see [7, 25]), more precisely,

Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R and N ∈ (1,∞). By a simple
calculation, we have (X, dr, mx
r ) for some x ∈ supp m being an RCD∗(r2K, N )
space. Take a point x ∈ supp m and ﬁx it. Consider the family of normalized metric
measure spaces {(X, dr, mx
r , x)}r∈(0,1). The following comes from a generalization
of Gromov’s compactness theorem.

Tan(X, d, m, x) :=(cid:8)(Y, dY , mY , y) ; (X, drn , mx

where {rn}n is a non-increasing sequence converging to 0. For simplicity, we just
denote by Tan(X, x) instead of Tan(X, d, m, x) if there is no confusion.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R and N ∈ (1,∞).

Note that by Theorem 2.5, we know neither the uniqueness of Rk nor m being
absolutely continuous to the k-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure Hk on Rk. And on
Ricci limit spaces, we know m(X \ Rl) = 0 for some 1 ≤ l ≤ N (see Theorem 1.1,
1.2).

3. Possible volume growth on regular sets

In this section we prove a behavior of measure of small balls on regular sets

under some assumption, which is crucial in the later section.

We say a metric measure space (Y, r, ν) nontrivial if Diam (Y, r) > 0 and ν(Y ) ∈

(0,∞].

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let (X, d, m) be a metric measure space. We deﬁne the following
weakly regular set.

WE k :=(cid:8)x ∈ X ; There exists a nontrivial X ′ with X ′ × Rk ∈ Tan(X, x)(cid:9) .

The author and Lakzian proved the following lemma, which is independently

proven by Kell [17].

Lemma 3.2 ([19, Corollary 5.5], [17, Lemma 7]). Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N )
space for K ∈ R, N ∈ (1,∞). Assume supp m = X and X is nontrivial. Fix a
point y ∈ X. Then for any R > 0, there exists a constant C = C(R, y) such that

m(Bs(x)) ≤ Cs

for each x ∈ BR(y) and any s ∈ (0, 1].
Proposition 3.3. Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R and N ∈
(1,∞). Take a point x ∈ WE k−1. Suppose that

for some α < k. Then

Proof. Let {ri}i∈N be a sequence that realizes Xri → X ′×Rk−1 ∈ Tan(X, x), where
(X ′, d′, m′) is nontrivial. Since (X ′, d′, m′) is an RCD∗(0, N − k + 1) space by the
splitting theorem [14], m′(Br(x′)) ≤ Cr for small r > 0 holds by Lemma 3.2. Thus
Lk−1 × m′(Br(0, x′)) ≤ Lk−1(Br(0))m′(Br(x′)) ≤ C0rk holds for some constant
C0 > 0. For any ǫ > 0, we obtain

4. Bishop inequality and regular sets on RCD spaces

From now, we always assume that every metric measure space (X, d, m) satis-
ﬁes supp m = X. In this section we deﬁne variants of the Bishop inequalities on
RCD∗(K, N ) spaces. We prove every RCD∗(K, N ) space satisﬁes the weak gen-
eralized Bishop inequality. For any K ′ ∈ R and N ′ ∈ N, deﬁne V K ′,N ′ as the

8

YU KITABEPPU

normalized volume measure on the space form of curvature K ′ and of dimension
N ′, where normalized means in the sense of (2.1).
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let (X, d, m) be a metric measure space. For given K ′ ∈ R and
N ′ ∈ N, we say that (X, d, m) satisﬁes the generalized Bishop inequality BI(K ′, N ′),
if for any ǫ > 0, and any x ∈ X, there exists a small number rǫ,x > 0 such that
s (x)) ≤ (1 + ǫ)V r2K ′,N ′ (s)
(4.1)
holds for any r ∈ (0, rǫ,x) and any s ∈ (0, min{Diam X, 1}).
Remark 4.2. It is obvious that N -dimensional Riemannian manifolds with Ricci
curvature bounded below by K and non-collapsing (K, N )-Ricci limit spaces satisfy
the generalized Bishop inequality BI(K, N ). However a collapsing Ricci limit space
does not satisfy BI(K, N ) inequality since at m-a.e. points, the behavior of volumes
of balls are controlled by a dimension in the sense of Colding-Naber, see [8–10, 12].

r (Bdr

The generalized Bishop inequality might be thought that it is too strong condi-
tion for general metric measure spaces. However a bit weaker condition is always
satisﬁed for any ﬁnite dimensional RCD spaces.
Proposition 4.3. Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space. Then (X, d, m) satisﬁes
the following: for any ǫ > 0, x ∈ Rl for 1 ≤ l ≤ N , and s ∈ (0, min{Diam X, 1}),
there exists a small number rǫ,x,s > 0 such that

r (Bdr

s (x)) ≤ (1 + ǫ)V r2K,l(s)

mx
holds for any r ∈ (0, rǫ,x,s).
Proof. Suppose (X, d, m) does not satisfy the above property. Then there exist
ǫ > 0, x ∈ Rl for some 1 ≤ l ≤ N , and s ∈ (0, 1) such that
nK,l(s)

(x)) > (1 + ǫ)V r2

rn(Bdrn

s

holds for some decreasing sequence {rn}n∈N with rn → 0. Letting n → ∞ leads

Ll(Bs(0)) ≥ (1 + ǫ)V 0,l(s) = (1 + ǫ)Ll(Bs(0)).

This is a contradiction.

(cid:3)

The following is the main result in this paper.

Theorem 4.4. Let (X, d, m) be a RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R and N ∈ N.
Assume X is nontrivial and satisﬁes the generalized Bishop inequality. Then Rl = ∅
for any l < N . In particular m(X \ RN ) = 0.
Proof. Suppose Rl
Bishop-Gromov inequality,

6= ∅ for some 1 ≤ l < N . Take a point x ∈ Rl. By the

Therefore

This contradicts Proposition 3.4. Hence Rl = ∅ if l < N . Hence combining this
fact and Theorem 2.5 leads the consequence.

(cid:3)

The following is a direct consequence of the proof of Theorem 4.4.

Corollary 4.5. Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R, N ∈ N and
assume (X, d, m) satisﬁes the generalized Bishop inequality. Then

m(Br(x))

m(Br(x))

holds for any x ∈ X. In particular (4.2) holds for any x ∈ RN .

For given two Borel measures µ, ν on X, we say µ and ν are equivalent if µ is

absolutely continuous with respect to ν, µ ≪ ν, and also ν ≪ µ.
Corollary 4.6. Let (X, d, m) be the same as Corollary 4.5. Then m is equivalent
to the N -dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure HN on RN . Moreover the Hausdorﬀ
dimension of (X, d) is N .

Proof. We deﬁne the set Ci, i = 1, 2, . . ., by

Ci :=(cid:26)x ∈ X ;

r→0

m(Br(x))

< i, for r ∈ (0, 1)(cid:27) .

By Proposition A.3 in Appendix A, we claim that Ci is a Borel set for each i ∈ N.
By Corollary 4.5, RN ⊂ ∪i∈NCi. By Theorem 2.4.3 in [5], m|Ci is equivalent to HN
on Ci. Since m(X \ RN ) = 0, there exist a number i ∈ N and a measurable subset
A ⊂ Ci such that 0 < c−1
i m(A) ≤ HN (A) ≤ cim(A) < ∞ hold for some constant
ci > 0. Thus dimHX ≥ N . On the other hand, by Corollary 2.5 in [25], we have
dimHX ≤ N if supp m = X. Thus we have the conclusion.

5. Tangent cones

In this section, we consider tangent cones at any points on RCD∗(K, N ) spaces
with the generalized Bishop inequality BI(K, N ). For noncollapsing Ricci limit
spaces, all tangent cones are metric cones. Here we prove the same result in our
setting. The following result plays a key role in our proof.

Theorem 5.1 ([15, Theorem 1.1]). Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(0, N ) space with
supp m = X, o ∈ X, and R > r > 0 such that
r(cid:19)N
m(BR(o)) =(cid:18) R

m(Br(o)).

Then exactly one of the following holds:

(1) SR/2(o) contains only one point. In this case (X, o) is pointed isometric to
([0, Diam (X, d)], 0) and via the isometry, m|BR(o) can be seen as cxN −1dx
for c := N m(BR(o)).
(2) SR/2(o) contains two points. In this case (X, d) is a 1-dimensional Rie-
mannian manifolds possibly with boundary, and there is a bijective local
isometry from BR(o) to (−R, R) sending o to 0 and the measure m|BR(o)
to the measure c|x|N −1dx for c := N m(BR(o))/2. Moreover such local
isometry is an isometry when restricted to BR/2(o).

10

(3) SR/2(o) contains more than two points. In this case N ≥ 2 and there exists
an RCD∗(N − 2, N − 1) space (Z, dZ , mZ) with Diam (Z, dZ ) ≤ π such that
the ball BR(o) is locally isometric to the ball BR(oY ) of the cone built over
Z. Moreover such local isometry is an isometry when restricted to BR/2(o).
Theorem 5.2. Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R and N ∈ (1,∞).
Assume the generalized Bishop inequality BI(K, N ). Then tangent cones are metric
cones. Moreover, every tangent cone (Y, dY , mY ) is isometric to a cone over an
RCD∗(N − 2, N − 1) space (Z, dZ , mZ).
Proof. Take an arbitrary point x ∈ X and ﬁx it. By the Corollary 4.5, we have

0 < lim sup

r→0

m(Br(x))

rN

< ∞.

And by the Bishop-Gromov inequality, we have the monotonicity of r 7→ m(Br(x))/VK,N (r).
Hence we obtain the limit

C1 := lim
r→0

m(Br(x))

rN

.

Take a tangent cone (Y, dY , mY , y) ∈ Tan(X, x). Denote by {rn}n∈N the decreasing
sequence that realized the convergent sequence {(X, drn, mx
rn , x)}n∈N to Y . Since

m(Br(x)) ≤

m(Br/2(x))

(x,·) dm converges to a positive and ﬁnite constant C2. For simplicity, we just

holds, we are able to take a subsequence {rnk}k∈N such that rN

write {rk} instead of {rnk}. Then we obtain

Therefore the equality

mY (Bs2 (y))
mY (Bs1 (y))

s1(cid:19)N
=(cid:18) s2

holds for any s1, s2 > 0. Since N > 1 and R = RN , (Y, dY , mY ) has no 1-
dimensional regular set by Theorem 1.1 in [19]. Therefore, by Theorem 5.2, (Y, dY , mY )
has to be a metric cone built over an RCD∗(N − 2, N − 1) space (Z, dZ , mZ). (cid:3)
Remark 5.3. By Theorem 4.4, Corollary 4.5, Theorem 5.2, it seems that RCD
spaces with the generalized Bishop inequality are able to be called “Non-collapsing
RCD spaces”. However the following example holds. Consider the closed convex
domain U in the N -dimensional Euclidean space. Since non-collapsing Ricci limit
space do not have boundaries(see [8]), such a domain U is not a non-collapsing
Ricci limit space. However, U with the standard Euclidean metric and the Lebesgue
measure satisﬁes RCD(0, N ) condition, moreover, it satisﬁes the generalized Bishop
inequality. Still, as far as the author knows, whether U is a collapsing Ricci limit
space or not is unknown.

Appendix A. Continuity of the volume of balls on metric measure

Let (X, d, m) be a geodesic metric measure space with supp m = X. We say that

(X, d, m) satisﬁes the BG(K, N ) condition for K ∈ R, N ∈ (1,∞) if

RCD∗(K, N ) spaces satisfy the BG(K, N ) condition. Deﬁne the function F (r) :=
R r
Lemma A.1. Let (X, d, m) be a geodesic metric measure space satisfying BG(K, N )
condition for K ∈ R, N ∈ (1,∞). For given r > 0 we take two points x, y ∈ X
such that d(x, y) < r. Then we obtain

m(Br(x) \ Br(y))

m(Br(x))

≤

F ′(r − d(x, y)/2)
F (r + d(x, y)/2)

d(x, y) + o(d(x, y))

as d(x, y) → 0.

In the same spirit as [18], we prove the local Lipschitz continuity of the volume

of balls.
Lemma A.2. Let (X, d, m) be an RCD∗(K, N ) space for K ∈ R and N ∈ (1,∞).
Take a point x0 ∈ X and ﬁx it. Let R > 0 be a positive number. Then there exists
a positive number C2 := C2(x0, R) > 0, such that

|m(Br(x)) − m(Br(y))| ≤ C2d(x, y)

for any x, y ∈ BR(x0) and any r ∈ (0, 1).
Proof. By Lemma 3.2, there exists C′ := C′(x0, R) > 0 such that m(Br(x)) ≤ C′r
for any x ∈ BR(x0) and any r ∈ (0, 1). Take two points u, v ∈ BR(x0) with
d(u, v) < r. For simplicity, we write d := d(u, v). Then by Lemma A.1,

|m(Br(u)) − m(Br(v))| ≤ m(Br(u) \ Br(v)) + m(Br(v) \ Br(u))

(A.1)

d + o(d)(cid:27) (m(Br(u)) + m(Br(v)))

d (cid:19)(cid:27) =: ˜C < ∞.

Hence for suﬃciently small d, (A.1) is bounded above. Again take arbitrary distinct
points x, y ∈ BR(x0). Let γ : [0, 1] → X be a geodesic connecting them. Divide
the interval [0, 1] into [0, 1] = ∪[ti, ti+1], i = 1, . . . , n, so that d(γti , γti+1) < r. By
(A.1), we have

Since we are able to divide [0, 1] so that d(γti , γti+1) takes arbitrary small value, we
obtain

|m(Br(x)) − m(Br(y))| ≤ ˜Cd(x, y).

Putting C2 := ˜C leads the consequence.

(cid:3)

Proposition A.3. Let (X, d, m) be a geodesic metric measure space that satisﬁes
BG(K, N ) condition for K ∈ R, N ∈ (1,∞). For given a, b ∈ (0,∞) with a < b,
deﬁne the set Ca,b by

Ca,b :=(x ∈ X ; a ≤ lim inf

below, we only prove that

(cid:27)

is a Borel set. Let {ri}i∈N be a decreasing sequence that satisﬁes ri/ri+1 → 1
as i → ∞, for instance take ri = i−1. Consider a family of continuous functions
fri(x) := m(Bri (x))/rN
i , where the continuity of each fri for i ∈ N is guaranteed
by Lemma A.2. Hence lim inf i fri is a Borel function. Take an arbitrary x ∈ X and
j → lim inf r↓0 m(Br(x))/rN . For each
ﬁx it. Deﬁne {lj}j∈N such that m(Blj (x))/lN
j ∈ N, there exists i(j) ∈ N such that ri(j)+1 ≤ lj < ri(j). Then
