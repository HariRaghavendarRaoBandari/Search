The correlation function between two Polyakov loops encodes the free-energy shift due to a pair of sepa-
rated colour conjugated sources in the hot QCD vacuum. This is analyzed in terms of a novel K¨all´en-Lehmann
spectral representation for the separating distance, implying an increasing and concave free-energy at all tem-
peratures. We express the heavy ¯QQ free-energy shift below the phase transition in QCD in terms of colour
neutral purely hadronic states with no explicit reference to quarks and gluons. Good agreement with lattice data
is achieved when considering the avoided crossing mechanism underlying string breaking and with standard
quenched values of the string tension known from charmonium and bottomonium phenomenology.

Long before the advent of QCD the thermodynamic and hy-
drodynamic interpretation of high energy collisions in terms
of hadrons was envisaged after the pioneering works of
Fermi [1] and Landau [2] (for a review see e.g. [3]). A ma-
jor inspiring breakthrough came about when Hagedorn found
that purely hadronic matter forming a hadron resonance gas
(HRG) has an exponentially growing level density implying
the existence of a hadronic limiting temperature [4] of about
TH = 150MeV (see [5] for an upgrade and [6] for a histor-
ical overview). According to the quantum virial expansion
this corresponds to a weakly interacting multicomponent gas
of resonances [7]. The discovery of asymptotic freedom and
QCD in terms of quarks and gluons carrying experimentally
elusive colour degrees of freedom triggered an intensive re-
search on the phase structure over the last half a century and
has motivated a dedicated experimental effort at SPS, RHIC
and LHC facilities within the heavy ions collisions traveling at
almost the speed of light [3]. Lattice calculations provide di-
rect access to the equation of state (EoS) and a strong evidence
that a crossover between a hadron gas and a quark-gluon liq-
uid phase takes place at a temperature of about 150MeV [8].
The ﬁnal consensus on the EoS has only been achieved re-
cently buttressing in passing the venerable HRG in the sub-
critical region (see e.g. [9, 10] for reviews) and promoting
this model as a canonical comparison tool for lattice calcu-
lations monitoring non-hadronic effects [11, 12]. Besides,
modern hydrodynamical descriptions of ultrarelativistic heavy
ions provide in a uniﬁed way the formation of the ﬁreball as
well as the subsequent evolution process just in terms of the
EoS in the gas-liquid crossover interregnum [3].

In a non-abelian gauge theory such as QCD one can mean-
ingfully address speciﬁc information on quark and gluon
colour charges and their interactions in the hot vacuum be-
yond the EoS which could not be posed in the pre-QCD
times. Nonetheless, we expect that any physical observable be
still described in terms of manifestly colour singlet hadronic
states below the phase transition. We have recently shown

this quark-hadron duality at ﬁnite temperature for the quark
self-energy via the renormalized Polyakov loop [13] using sin-
gle heavy meson charm and bottom excited spectra (see also
[14]). (See [15] for higher representations and [16] for a ped-
agogical discussion.) In this letter we verify that the quark-
antiquark free-energy can be represented, as naively expected,
via purely hadronic states and a single bosonic string poten-
tial, with no explicit reference to quarks and gluons. This
requires a non-trivial level avoided crossing structure in the
heavy-light meson-antimeson spectrum and is done in har-
mony with a new Laplace-Stietjels spectral representation of
the Polyakov correlator, whence concavity properties of the
free-energy at any temperature can be trivially deduced. Some
motivation for the present work has been presented previously
in [17, 18].

When two heavy colour charge conjugated sources belong-
ing to the representations R and ¯R of the colour gauge group
SU(Nc) are created and placed at a given distance in the hot
vacuum, there arises a free-energy which provides the max-
imum work the system can exchange with the medium at
a ﬁxed temperature. McLerran and Svetitsky suggested 35
years ago to explore these free-energies for the fundamental
representation as suitable order parameters for a hadronic-
quark gluon plasma phase transition [19, 20] (for an early
review see e.g. [21]). Denoting Z0 the partition function of
the system without sources, ZR⊗ ¯R the partition function with
heavy sources a distance r apart, and C the correlation func-
tion between Polyakov loops,

ZR⊗ ¯R(r,T )

C(r,T ) = (cid:104)trRΩ(r)tr ¯RΩ(0)(cid:105)T =

A0dt is a purely glu-
onic operator, trR(1) = dimR, and (cid:104) (cid:105)T is the thermal vacuum
expectation value. Correspondingly, for the shift in the free-
energy

temperature is zero. Therefore, in this picture, the expecta-
tion values are taken in the vacuum state of Hz(T ), which we
denote |0;T(cid:105).

To carry out a canonical treatment, a convenient choice is
the axial gauge ∂tAt = 0 (where At is the gluon gauge ﬁeld
in the t direction). This leaves the Polyakov loop in the t di-
rection, Ω(x,y), together with Ax,y,z and q, ¯q, as degrees of
freedom. Ω acts in the Hilbert space as a multiplicative opera-
tor. In this view the expectation value of two Polyakov loops,
one at x = y = z = 0 and the other at x = y = 0, and a later time
z = r, represents the action of the operator TrRΩ† (at x,y = 0)
on the vacuum |0,T(cid:105) at time z = 0 followed by evolution to
time z = r to connect again with TrRΩ†|0,T(cid:105)

C(r,T ) = (cid:104)0,T|TrRΩe−rHz(T )TrRΩ†|0,T(cid:105).

This allows to establish an exact spectral representation valid
for any representation R and any temperature, by inserting a
complete set of eigenstates of Hz,

The density of states excited by the Polyakov loop, τ(µ,T ), is
a non-negative function with support on µ ≥ 0 [41] so Eq. (6)
is a Laplace-Stietjels transformation [23].
The r-independent disconnected component of C(r,T ) (i.e.,
the term n = 0), yields a contribution (cid:104)trRΩ(cid:105)2
T δ (µ) in τ(µ,T ).
The connected part τc(µ,T ) contains r-dependent informa-
tion from excited states. It can be computed in closed form
in the relevant case of string tension plus Coulomb term, i.e.,
F(r,T ) = σRr− αR/r,

function. The delta term represents the Hz(T ) lowest-lying
state, a string of length β , which dominates the long distance
tail of the correlation in the string plus Coulomb model. On
the other hand, the Coulomb-induced term is expected to satu-
rate the large µ region of τ(µ,T ) of full QCD, albeit softened
by asymptotic freedom. This ensures the convergence of the
measure τ(µ,T )e−rµ at large µ for r > 0.

An interesting consequence of the spectral relation (6)
comes from the fact that τ(µ,T ) is positive and with pos-
itive support. This automatically implies that C(r,T ) is
a completely convex function with respect

(−1)ndnC(r,T )/drn ≥ 0. Further bounds on the free-energy
can be derived from the average of non negative polynomials
(e.g., µ(µ − a(cid:104)µ(cid:105))2) using τ(µ,T )e−rµ as weight.
In par-
ticular, letting f = F(r,T )/T , it follows that the quantities
f (cid:48), − f (cid:48)(cid:48),
f (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) − f (cid:48) f (cid:48)(cid:48), and 2 f (cid:48)(cid:48)2 − f (iv) are non-negative for
all (r,T ), where the prime denotes derivative with respect to
r. The ﬁrst two relations imply

where F(T ) is the shift in the free-energy produced by intro-
ducing a single heavy charge.

To avoid paradoxes it is important to note that, unlike
FR⊗ ¯R(r,T ) and F0(T ), the shift F(r,T ) is not a true free-
energy. It is not extensive and thermodynamic stability does
not require the entropy shift S(r,T ) = −∂ F(r,T )/∂ T to be
positive for all temperatures. Likewise, C(r,T ) is not a true
partition functions (i.e., a sum of states with non negative in-
teger degeneracies) but rather the ratio of two partition func-
tions [22]. Nevertheless, by the same arguments given in
[13, 15] for the Polyakov loop, this ratio should behave, to a
good approximation, like a partition function for temperatures
below the crossover, that is,

where ρ(E,r) is non negative. This implies that standard ther-
modynamic relations apply to F(r,T ) in this low temperature
regime. Similar remarks apply for (cid:104)trRΩ(cid:105) and F(T ).

The obvious approach to the heavy quark-antiquark free-
energy is to consider a compactiﬁed Euclidean time to include
the ﬁnite temperature, so the three coordinates x,y,z are spa-
tial ones and t is time-like (see Fig. 1, left). Additional infor-
mation can be obtained from the alternative point of view in
which x,y,t are regarded as spatial coordinates and z as Eu-
clidean time (see Fig. 1, right). In this picture β = 1/T (the
inverse physical temperature) is the size of the system in the
spatial t direction. The size remains inﬁnite in the x and y
directions. The system is described by a Hamiltonian Hz(T )
which produces the evolution in the z direction and depends on
T . Since the size in the z direction is unbounded the effective

quark-antiquark potential V (r) = F(r,0) must be an increas-
ing and concave function of r, V(cid:48)(r) ≥ 0 and V(cid:48)(cid:48)(r) ≤ 0, a re-
sult previously established from reﬂection positivity [24, 25].
A similar representation to ours on the lattice was proposed
long ago [26] although the important new implications dis-
cussed here were not addressed. A further property from the
Laplace-Stietjels representation is that the analytical continu-
ation to the complex plane r has no singularities for Re(r) > 0.
In addition to the usual scheme (x,y,z;t) and the one con-
sidered here, (x,y,t;z), a third scheme would be (x,z,t;y) y
being now the time direction. In this case C(r,T ) is just the
expectation value of an operator, TrFΩ(r)TrFΩ†(0), acting at
time y = 0 on the vacuum |0,T(cid:105) (the same vacuum as in the
(x,z,t;y) scheme). No excited states are involved in this case.
In the extraction of physical information from lattice cal-
culations the renormalization of the free-energy plays a cru-
cial role. At distances shorter than the thermal wavelength,
rT (cid:28) 1, one expects that the medium plays a minor role
and due to asymptotic freedom perturbative QCD applies
[27, 28]. This requirement has been emphasized in a series
of insightful works [29, 30]. A limitation is that the neces-
sary small values of r might not be attainable in current lat-
tice settings. More recently, a full calculation with realistic
dynamical quark masses has been carried out for fundamen-
tal sources [31, 32]. There, the lattice action is renormal-
ized at zero temperature, i.e., by following lines of constant
physics. The only new ultraviolet ambiguity introduced by the
Polyakov loop operators is a single r- and T - independent (al-
though R-dependent) additive constant in F(r,T ) which can
be ﬁxed by setting F(r0,T0) = F0 for conventionally chosen
r0, T0, and F0.

On physical grounds one expects that below the phase tran-
sition the free-energy shifts should be expressed in terms of
hadronic colour singlet states, but the precise mathematical
formulation of this expectation has never been made clear. At
zero temperature and for fundamental sources, the concept
of string tension has played a major role in the formulation
and understanding of conﬁnement and colour gauge invari-
ance in the pure Yang-Mills theory. In the zero temperature
limit one has for large distances F(r,0) ∼ σr. In QCD how-
ever, the string between fundamental charges breaks gener-
ating a ¯qq pair from the vacuum which subsequently decays
into hadronic states, and so instead F(r,0) ∼ 2∆ where ∆ is
the mass of the lowest-lying bound state (a hybrid heavy-light
meson). The breaking of the string has been studied on the
lattice [33] observing the phenomenon of avoided crossing
between the ¯QQ and the ¯BB ≡ ( ¯Qq)( ¯qQ) channels, familiar
from molecular physics in the Born-Oppenheimer approxima-
tion [34].

To analyze the ¯QQ free-energy lattice results in the conﬁned
phase we will apply the approximate T -spectral representation
in Eq. (4) and the exact r-spectral representation in Eq. (6).
Further, we will consider the coupled-channel Hilbert space
spanned by ¯QQ and the (low-lying and excited) ¯BB states,

In Fig. 2 we illustrate the sit-

spectrum of heavy-light mesons with a charm quark from
the Godfrey-Isgur relativized quark model (RQM) [35] up
to ∆B = 3.19GeV. Besides reproducing accurately de PDG
level density, the RQM satisfactorily describes the Polyakov
loop below the crossover and, for the heavy-light system with
charm or bottom quarks, yields an exponentially growing
spectrum ρ ∼ e∆B/TH with Polyakov-Hagedorn temperature
TH,c = 210MeV [36]. Before mixing, all ¯BB levels cross with
the quenched ¯QQ potential (note the relatively large gaps be-
tween lower ¯BB levels mixing with the ¯QQ channel). The
avoided crossings correspond to ¯BB states with the same JPC
quantum numbers as the ¯QQ, which are also highlighted in
Fig. 2 for the RQM using a mixing W to be discussed subse-
quently.

where the last term is just (e−F(T )/T )2, the squared of the
Polyakov loop expectation value [13]. Using the data of
Ref. [31] for F(r,T ) and F(T ) = F(∞,T )/2, one can extract
V ¯QQ(r) by inverting Eq. (10). This yields a T -independent po-
tential for rT (cid:28) 1 but with a string tension σ = (0.55GeV)2,
almost twice the conventionally accepted value (0.42GeV)2.
This disturbing result suggests that determining the string ten-
sion or renormalizing the free-energy-shift from short dis-
tances (at least in lattice QCD with realistic quark masses
and current lattice spacings) may contradict the long distance
and well established charmonium phenomenology, based on
quenched determinations of the string tension.

Remarkably Eq. (10) is fully consistent with the exact r-
representation. However, when channel mixing is allowed
and the modiﬁed eigenvalues are introduced in the T -spectral
representation, the admissible mixings get constrained by the
concavity relations in Eq. (8). For instance, in the low tem-
perature limit the lowest eigenvalue dominates and this im-
0 (r) ≤ 0 (no such direct
plies the conditions E(cid:48)
constraint applies to the excited states). The two-level setting
in Eq. (11) (below) illustrates that W cannot be arbitrary: for
large enough W > 0 (the sign is conventional) E0(r) ∼ −W (r)
and so the concavity relations require W(cid:48) ≤ 0 and W(cid:48)(cid:48) ≥ 0.

0(r) ≥ 0 and E(cid:48)(cid:48)

To study the phenomenon of avoided crossings in closer
detail and paralleling the treatment in [33], let us introduce a

The role of the remaining ¯BB states is to saturate the Polyakov
loop. This simplest mixing model allows to determine W (r)
point by point from F(r,T ). A crucial consistency check of
the approach is that W must be T -independent. As we can
see from Fig. 3 the short distance behaviour is pretty much
independent of the temperature provided we take the standard
value for the string tension, σ = (0.42GeV)2. Moreover, in
the common range for temperatures T = 150,175,200MeV
an exponential behaviour is obtained (at least above 0.13fm),
in agreement with the functional form proposed in Refs. [37–
39]. A ﬁt with W = ge−mr to the lattice data at T = 150MeV
with α = π/16 and ∆ = 472MeV (the lowest Isgur state)
produces σ = (0.424(14)GeV)2, g = 0.98(47)GeV and m =
0.80(38)GeV (with g and m highly positively correlated). We
have checked that including more states in the mixing just re-
duces the strength of the transition potential W but does not
change the exponential behaviour.
In both cases, the cou-
pling only involves ﬂavorless and spinless ¯BB combinations,
to match the quantum numbers of the ¯QQ state.

The form of the mixing potential is qualitatively similar
to that found in Ref. [33] where the correlators of the ma-
trix were computed at zero temperature, but for pion masses

between the two treatments.

around 700MeV. Since the lattice data used in our deter-
mination of W (r) were obtained for physical hadron masses
we do not expect the observed exponential fall-off to cor-
respond to pion exchange. Indeed, the iterated mechanism,
¯BB → ¯QQ → ¯BB represents meson-exchange and conversely,
any meson-exchange must involve some component of ¯QQ as
an intermediate state, but there is no compelling reason to ex-
pect that the lighter mesons should be dominant in the transi-
tion potential W (r) in the range of distances considered. The
value m = 800MeV is in the range of a typical meson mass
with no special mass-reducing mechanism (e.g., chiral sym-
metry in the pion case) at work.

We have shown that below the phase transition the parti-
tion function of the thermal QCD vacuum in presence of two
conjugated heavy charges can be expressed in terms of pairs
of purely hadronic states with a single heavy-quark plus the
quark-antiquark static potential of gluodynamics and actually
this description provides a gateway to determine the string ten-
sion. This implies a non-trivial level avoided crossing struc-
ture in the heavy-light mesonic spectrum which successfully
describes lattice QCD data. This is done in harmony with a
new K¨all´en-Lehmann spectral representation of the Polyakov
correlator, whence concavity properties of the free-energy at
any temperature can be straightforwardly deduced. In addi-
tion, since quite generally any quantum system undergoing a
conventional thermal phase transition will be unbounded in
some direction, our construction (in which 1/T is a spatial
size of the rotated system) suggests that thermal phase tran-
sitions can be regarded as quantum phase transitions at zero
temperature, the external parameter being the physical tem-
perature T . As it is well known the order of the quantum phase
transition is related to the level structure and corresponding

a ﬁnal speculation motivated by our exact spectral representa-
tion, one may wonder whether the string tension admits an ex-
act deﬁnition (complex and perhaps T -dependent) even in un-
quenched QCD, in the same way that the masses of hadronic
resonances admit a precise deﬁnition as poles of the S-matrix
complex plane. The Dirac-delta term in Eq. (7) remains an ex-
act contribution in gluodynamics, and this term might move to
the complex µ-plane in full QCD.
