VERY AMPLENESS OF THE BICANONICAL LINE BUNDLE ON

COMPACT COMPLEX TWO BALL QUOTIENTS

SAI-KEE YEUNG

Abstract. The purpose of this note is to show that 2K of any smooth com-
pact complex two ball quotient is very ample, where K is the canonical line
bundle.

1. Introduction

1.1. General results on the very ampleness of the pluricanonical line bundle pKM
for small p on a complex manifold of general type is a natural and interesting
problem. For a general smooth surface of general type, nice bounds have been
obtained by Bombieri [Bom] and Reider [R]. The purpose of this note is to investi-
gate the smallest possible p in the situation of smooth compact complex two ball
quotients, which are special but at the same time play prominent roles in some
concrete algebraic and arithmetic problems. In fact, they include as special cases
the Deligne-Mostow surfaces (cf.
[M],
[PY], [CS]) and Cartwright-Steger surfaces (cf.
[CS]). Geometrically, they form
a boundary line in the geography of smooth surfaces of general type, sometimes
known as the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau line. Arithmetically they contain one of the
two main classes of Shimura varieties of dimension 2, the other being the Hilbert
modular surfaces.

[P], [Le], [DM]), fake projective planes (cf.

C/Π, where B2

C = {(z1, z2)||z1|2 + |z2|2 < 1} and Π is

a cocompact lattice in P U (2, 1), the automorphism group of B2
C. It follows that
the M equipped with the Poincar´e metric is a K¨ahler-Einstein metric of negative
scalar curvature.
In particular, the canonical line bundle KM is ample. From
Kodaira’s Embedding Theorem, we know that the linear system |pKM | associated
to the pluricanonical line bundle pKM gives an embedding of M if p is suﬃciently
large. In other words, pKM is very ample if p is suﬃciently large. The purpose of
this note is to show the following sharper results in the case of complex two ball
quotients.

Theorem 1. Let M be a smooth compact complex two ball quotient. Then 2KM
is very ample.

Theorem 1 is optimal since fake projective planes, which are complex two ball
quotients, have no sections in KM . Furthermore, KM itself is asymptotically very
ample on towers of coverings from [Y]. We refer the readers to Lemma 1 in 2.1 for
more elaborations.

The result could be reduced to the case of M with Euler number 3, which

corresponds to the marginal case in the argument of Reider [R].

Theorem 2. The bicanonical
line bundle 2KM is very ample for any compact
complex two ball quotient M with c2(M ) = 3. In particular, this is true for the one
hundred fake projective planes and the two Cartwright-Steger surfaces.

The question for fake projective planes and the Cartwright-Steger surfaces is one

of the original motivation for this note. See also 2.1 for other motivations.

Recall that sections of qKM can be regarded as automorphic forms of weight q
on a locally Hermitian symmetric space. The result implies that there are a lot
of automorphic forms of weight 2 on a compact complex two ball quotient M . In
fact, they are enough to embed M as a complex submanifold in some projective
space. In particular, they embed fake projective planes and the Cartwright-Steger
surfaces into P 9
C.

We also remark that there have been lots of interesting work about birational
properties of the bicanonical maps on a surface of general type. In particular, there
is the result of Borrelli in [Bor], which incorporates and summarizes earlier results
of Catanese, Ciliberto, Debarre, Francia, Mendes Lopes, Morrison and Xiao. For
this note, the main tool is the argument of Reider in [R].

The author is grateful to Lawrence Ein for raising the question about the Cartwright-

Steger surfaces and for explaining the argument of Reider to the author.

2. Preliminary discussions

2.1. To put the discussions in this note in perspective, let us collect some known
facts.

Lemma 1. Let M be a smooth compact complex two ball quotient.
(a). c2(M ) is a multiple of 3 and K 2
(b). KM is eﬀective except for the case of M being a fake projective plane.
(c). For any tower of coverings {Mi} sitting above M1 = M , KMi is very ample if
i is suﬃciently large.

M is a multiple of 9.

Proof (a). It is well-known that for a smooth compact complex two ball quotient,
a minimal surface of general type, the characteristic numbers c2
1, c2 and arithmetic
genus χ(O) are all positive integers, cf. [BHPV]. From Noether’s Formula, we know
that 1
1(M ) + c2(M )) = χ(OM ) ∈ Z+. From the equality case of the Miyaoka-
Yau inequality, we know that c1(M )2 = 3c2(M ).
It follows that c2(M ) ∈ 3Z+.
Hence c2

12 (c2

1(M ) ∈ 9Z+.

(b). From deﬁnition, 1−h1(M )+h2(M ) = χ(OM ) ∈ Z+. We see that h2(M ) = 0
if and only if χ(OM ) = 1 and h1(M ) = 0, which implies that c2(M ) = 3. It follows
that M is a fake projective plane as deﬁned in [M] and classiﬁed in [PY]. We observe
now that h0(M, KM ) = h2(M ) from Serre Duality.

(c). By a tower of coverings of M , we mean a sequence of manifolds Mi = M/Πi,
where Πi+1 is a normal subgroup of Πi of ﬁnite index. It is proved in [Y] that KMi
is very ample if i is suﬃciently large. We remark that it was shown earlier by
Hwang and To in [HT] that 2KMi is very ample if i is suﬃciently large.

(cid:3)
The results prompt the question of what the smallest p should be to make sure
that pKM is very ample for all smooth compact complex two ball quotient M .
From Lemma 1b, we know that we need p > 1 since Γ(M, KM ) is trivial for M
being a fake projective plane. Hence Theorem 1 is the optimal result that we can

expect. For fake projective planes, it is known that 3KM is very ample, cf. [PY],
10.5, following from a result of Bombieri [Bom].

3. Tools from the results of Bogomolov and Reider.

3.1. For the proof of Theorem 1, we recall ﬁrst the following technical result, which
is essentially a result of Reider [R], which is based on the result of Bogomolov (cf.
[BHPV], p. 168). We go through some details since the terminology and the
argument are needed to prove our results in the next section.

Proposition 1. Let M be a smooth compact complex two ball quotient for which
with c2(M ) = 3. Then 2KM is base point free. Furthermore, if sections of
Γ(M, 2KM ) do not separate p, q ∈ M, there exists an eﬀective curve B containing
p, q, which can be two inﬁnitesimally closed points, and satisfy one of the following
two properties,
(i). B · B = 0 and K · B = 2,
(ii). 1

3 KM = B + τ , where τ is a torsion line bundle.

In the following Z is a subscheme of length 2 and would either be Z1 = {p},
Z2 = {p, q}, or Z3 = {2p} corresponding to base point of 2KM , non-separated
points or inﬁnitesimally non-separable points.

As argued in [R], see also [BHPV] page 176, we may ﬁnd a vector bundle E

coming from extension

0 → OM → E → IZ ⊗ KM → 0

with c1(E) = c1(KM ) and c2(E) = deg Z. Hence c2(E) = 2 and

(1)

c1(E)2 − 4c1(E) > 1.

Hence E is Bogomolov unstable and we have from Bogomolov’s Theorem (cf. [BHPV],
p. 168) that there is a diagram

L · B + deg W = c2(E) = deg Z = 2

(L − B) · H > 0 ∀ ample H

(L − B)2 > deg Z = 2

It is easy to see that t is non-trivial and hence there is an eﬀective divisor B of

Γ(M, B) passing through Z. Note that from Hodge Index Theorem,

(6)

(B2)(L2) 6 (L · B)2 6 4,

where we have used (3). Furthermore,

0 < K · (L − B) = (L + B) · (L − B)

implies that

(7)

L2 > B2

Consider ﬁrst the case that B2 6 0. As K is ample, 0 < K · B = L · B + B2. We
conclude that B2 > −L·B > −2 from (3). Hence K ·B is either 1 or 2. If K ·B = 1,
the above identities imply that B2 = −1, which by Adjunction Formula implies that
B is an elliptic curve, contradicting the fact that M is complex hyperbolic. Hence
we are left with the case (i), namely, K · B = 2 and B2 = 0

Consider now the case that B2 > 0. From (6) and (7), B2 = 1. (6) and (2)

imply that (B · KM )2 6 9, which and Hodge Index Theorem

9 = B2K 2 6 (B · K)2 = 9

implies the case (ii) B = 1

4. Main argument

4.1. For subsections 4.1-4.6, we assume that M is a smooth compact complex two
ball quotient with c2(M ) = 3.

Lemma 2. Let H be a line bundle on M such that 3H = K (mod tor) on M . Let
τ be any torsion line bundle. Then h0(M, K + H + τ ) = 3.

Proof From Riemann-Roch,

h0(M, K + H + τ ) − h1(M, K + H + τ ) + h2(M, K + H + τ )

2

(K + H + τ ) · (H + τ ) + χ(M, O).

=

Since L is ample, h1(M, K +H +τ ) = 0, h2(M, K +H +τ ) from vanishing theorems.
As χ(M, O) = 1, it follows that h0(M, K + H + τ ) = 3.

(cid:3)

4.2.

Lemma 3. Assume that 3H = K + σ for some torsion line bundle σ. Let τ be any
torsion line bundle. Then h0(M, H + τ ) 6 1.

Proof Assume that H 0(M, H + τ ) contains two linearly independent sections s1
and s2. Then s4
2 give rise to ﬁve linearly independent sections of
K + H + τ − σ, where τ − σ is torsion. This follows from the fact that their generic
vanishing orders along the zero divisor of s1 are diﬀerent. This contradicts Lemma
1.

4.3. We now prepare for the proof of Theorem 2. From Chern number equality, we
know that K 2
M = 9. It follows from the argument of [R] that 2K is base point free,
as mentioned in Proposition 1. Note from Riemann-Roch and Kodaira Vanishing
Theorem that h0(M, 2K) = 10. Hence Φ|2KM | : M → N ⊂ P 9
C is a morphism,
where N is the image of Φ|2KM |.

(cid:3)

We begin with the following lemma.

Lemma 4. N has dimension 2.

Proof Assume on the contrary that the image is a curve so that Φ|2KM | would give
rise to a ﬁbration. From Stein Factorization, we may decompose Φ|2KM | = h ◦ f
where f : M → C has connected ﬁber. From Reider’s result as in the proof
of Proposition 1, each ﬁber of the ﬁbration would contain an eﬀective divisor B
satisfying (i) or (ii) of Proposition 1. In case that B is of type (ii), by considering
a generic section, it follows that B · B = 0, which contradicts the fact that B · B =
1
9 KM · KM = 1.

Hence it suﬃces to consider (i) with B ·B = 0 and K ·B = 2. We have a ﬁbration
f : M → C to a curve C with connected ﬁbers of genus 2 by Adjunction Formula.
Now as M is a compact complex two ball quotient, the ﬁbration f contains a
singular ﬁber from the result of [Li]. By considering base change and semi-stable
reduction, we have a commutative diagram

N → M
↓
↓
C1 → C

in which f1 : N → C1 is a semi-stable ﬁbration with generic ﬁber of genus 2. An
irreducible component of a singular ﬁber R1 of f1 is hence of genus 0 or 1. Hence
from the commutative diagram and the Riemann-Hurwitz Formula, a singular ﬁber
of f contains a curve of genus 1 or 0, which leads to a contradiction since M is
hyperbolic. The Lemma is proved.

(cid:3)

4.4. It follows from the lemma 4 that Φ|2KM | is generically ﬁnite. We claim the
following.

Lemma 5. Φ|2KM | is birational.

Proof Assume on the contrary that Φ|2KM | is not birational. According to Propo-
sition 1, either Case (i) or (ii) occurs. Consider ﬁrst Case (i). The proof is a
modiﬁcation of Corollary 2 of [R]. Then B in Proposition 1 has a moving part B′.
As B2 = 0, we get B′ · B′ = 0 and B′ moves in base point free family p : M → C.
Since 0 < KM · B′ 6 KM · B = 2, we conclude that either KM · B′ = 1 or 2. The
ﬁrst case violates Adjunction Formula, and for the second case, the Adjunction for-
mula gives rise to genus g(B′) = 2. As in the proof of the last lemma, there should

6

SAI-KEE YEUNG

exists a singular ﬁber in the family as M is a complex two ball quotient, which
however leads to a component of the singular ﬁber with normalization of genus
6 1, contradicting the fact that M is complex hyperbolic. We get a contradiction.
Consider now Case (ii) according to Proposition 1. As Φ|2KM | is not birational,
for two points x1, x2 ∈ Φ−1
|2KM |(y), there exists a section s ∈ Γ(M, L + τ ) for some
torsion line bundle τ on M passing through x1 and x2. Since there is no genus 2
ﬁbration according to the argument of Lemma 4, we may apply the results of Borrelli
in [Bor], in particular, Theorem 0.7 of [Bor]. As explained in [Bor], this is the results
of various authors including Catanese, Ciliberto, Debarre, Francia, Mendes Lopes,
Morrison and Xiao. We refer the readers to [Bor] for more references.

From Theorem 0.7, see also 0.4, of the result of Borrelli [Bor], we know that
Φ|2KM | factors through φ : M 99K Σ, where Σ is a twofold cover over a Du Val
Double plane. Note that for each y ∈ Σ, there exists x1, x2 ∈ φ−1(y) and a section
sy ∈ Γ(M, L + τy) for some torsion line bundle τy such that sy passes through x1
and x2. For each ﬁxed y, there is only a unique sy. For otherwise if there are
two such sections sy1, sy2 ∈ Γ(M, L + τy), the zero divisors Zsy1 · Zsy2 = 1 from
the deﬁnition of L, contradicting the fact that they both passes through x1 and x2
from construction. Now from Theorem 0.7, see also 0.4, of [Bor], we conclude that
either q = 0 or 1.

In the case of q = 0, M is just a fake projective plane and there are only a
ﬁnite choice of torsion line bundles given by H1(M, Z) from Universal Coeﬃcient
Theorem. Since y ∈ Σ is arbitrary, it implies that there are at least two diﬀerent
y with the same τy. This implies that there are at least two linearly independent
sections in Γ(M, L + τy), contradicting Lemma 3. In the case of q = 1, the Picard
variety of M has complex dimension 1. On the other hand, the point y ∈ Σ, which
has dimension 2. Hence there are at least one two diﬀerent y1, y2 ∈ Σ for which
τy1 = τy2. This implies that Γ(M, L + τy1) contains two sections s1, s2 passing
through the two pairs of the inverse image of y1, y2 in M respectively. Again the
same argument as above leads to a contradiction.

(cid:3)

4.5. Proof of Theorem 2

We conclude from the result of Reider [R], as mentioned in Proposition 1, that
Φ|2KM | is base point free. From Lemma 5 we conclude that Φ|2KM | is a birational
morphism. We claim that Φ|2KM | is an immersion. Let D be a divisor on M
along which Φ|2KM | is not an immersion.
If the dimension of Φ|2KM |(D) is 1,
the mapping Φ|2KM | is a branching map around D and the argument of the last
paragraph would rule it out. Suppose now that D is an exceptional divisor with the
image of Φ|2KM |(D) being a point. Grauert’s Contraction Criterion (cf. [BHPV])
then implies that an irreducible component of D1 satisﬁes D1 · D1 < 0. However,
according to (9) in Section 3, D1 should be a divisor B numerically the same as
1
3 KM with positive self-intersection. The contradiction implies that Φ|2KM | is an
immersion and the claim is proved. This concludes the proof of Theorem 2.

(cid:3)

4.6. We make the following observation, which is one of the original motivation for
this note.

Corollary 1. Let M be a fake projective plane or a Cartwright-Steger surface.
Then 2K is very ample.

BICANONICAL LINE BUNDLE ON COMPACT COMPLEX TWO BALL QUOTIENTS

The corollary follows since c2 = 3 for fake projective planes and the Cartwright-
Steger surface, cf.
[PY] and [CS] for the details. Very ampleness of 2KM for the
fake projective planes and Cartwright-Steger surface are the original motivations
for this note. Alternate arguments can be provided for these cases. In the following
we give such an arguement for M the Cartwight-Steger surface. Assume that 2KM
is not very ample. From the argument of the proof of Lemma 5, we know that there
cannot be genus 2 ﬁbration of M and hence it suﬃces for us to consider Case (ii)
of Proposition 1. In such case, 1
3 KM can be written as H + τ for some eﬀective H
and torsion line bundle τ . If τ is a 3-torsion element in P ic0(M ), we would have
KM = 3H. Otherwise we can ﬁnd a torsion line bundle σ such that 3σ = τ and
KM = 3(H + σ). In either case, the argument of 10.4 implies that the fundamental
group Π = π1(M ) can be lifted as a lattice from P U (2, 1) to SU (2, 1). This is
however contradicts the explicit description of the lattice Π in [CS], from which
abelianization can be readily found. Hence Proposition 1 implies that 2KM is very
ample.

4.7. Proof of Theorem 1

From Lemma 1, we know that c2

1(M ) is a positive multiple of 9. Suppose that
c2
1(M ) > 10, it already follows from the result of Reider [R] that 2KM is very
ample except for Case (i) described in Proposition 1. That is, for two points
x1, x2 ∈ M which are not separated by Φ|2KM |, there is a curve B passing through
two points x1, x2 as described in Case (i).
In such case, again from Adjunction
Formula, g(B) = 2. The ﬁrst paragraph in the proof of Lemma 5 still leads to a
contradiction. We conclude that 2KM is very ample for c2
1(M ) > 10. Theorem 1
now follows from Theorem 2 in the case of c2

1(M ) = 9.
