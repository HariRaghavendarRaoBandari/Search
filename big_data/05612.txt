Abstract. We discuss certain quadratic models of spinless fermions on a 1D lattice,
and their corresponding spin chains. These were studied by Keating and Mezzadri in
the context of their relation to the Haar measures of the classical compact groups. We
show how these models correspond to translation invariant models on an inﬁnite or
semi-inﬁnite chain, which in the simplest case reduce to the familiar XX model. We
give physical context to mathematical results for the entanglement entropy, and cal-
culate the spin-spin correlation functions using the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. These
calculations rigorously demonstrate universality in classes of these models. We show
that these are in agreement with ﬁeld theoretic and renormalization group arguments
that we provide.

1. Introduction

Universality is a central concept in statistical physics, and in many contexts modern
understanding is based on renormalization group (RG) arguments. Physical systems
exhibit universal behaviour when they share an eﬀective theory. This eﬀective theory is
reached by systematically removing irrelevant degrees of freedom, usually in the context
of a ﬂow of parameters in the space of Hamiltonians of quantum ﬁeld theories. In this
area rigorous arguments are scarce. In this paper, for a class of 1D spin systems which
can be related to certain free fermion models, we present rigorously derived physical
properties. We see that they correspond exactly to those expected from the analysis of
the eﬀective theory. In particular, the systems we are interested in are critical – the
eﬀective description is generically scale invariant and in fact has conformal symmetry,
so can be described by a conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT). We give the CFT description

of our class of models, which takes the form of a direct sum of non-interacting massless
fermions.

Ground states of 1D critical models are characterised by algebraic decay of correlations
and recently much interest has been shown in their entanglement structure. In [1, 2]
it is seen that the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a subsystem of linear size N
diverges logarithmically as

S(N ) = |A| c
6

log2 N + O(1).

(1)

Here |A| is the size of the boundary of the subsystem, and c is the central charge of
the corresponding CFT. A similar formula for the XX model was observed numerically
in [3] and then, including the extension to the R´enyi entropies, was proved in [4] using
the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. This was then substantially generalised in [5, 6] to wider
classes of models susceptible to random matrix theory techniques. We review these
results and see that (1), including the correction up to o(1), as well as the expected spin
correlations are veriﬁed exactly in these models.

Our main results are the following:

ied in [5].

• We give a physical interpretation of the large class of mathematical models stud-
• This allows us to understand the universal entanglement entropy scaling found
rigorously in that paper, and to predict the universal leading asymptotic scaling
of equal time spin-spin correlation functions, as well as the oscillatory prefactors.
• Where calculation is possible, we show that this prediction is indeed correct and
ﬁnd the coeﬃcients of the leading terms using proven cases of the generalized
Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. This corrects part of a similar calculation in [7].

The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we introduce the lattice model that is
the framework for our rigorous calculations. We then give a generic diagonal form of the
Hamiltonian for the cases we will consider and analyse this diagonal form using standard
quantum ﬁeld theoretic methods. We aim to keep the discussion self contained so review
some details. We postulate the eﬀective theory, and its dependence on microscopic
parameters, and show that this is consistent using RG arguments. From this conformally
invariant eﬀective theory we can read oﬀ the central charge and give an argument, via
bosonization, for the expected leading order behaviour of the correlation functions.

In Section 4 we introduce in detail the three subclasses of the lattice model which
permit further analysis and explain their physical relevance as well as the connection to
the work of Keating and Mezzadri [5, 6]. We then review the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture,
proved in [8] which is essential for the rigorous analysis that follows in Section 6.

We note that the bulk universality classes of our models, parameterised by a ﬁnite
number of Fermi momenta and velocities, are identiﬁed in [9] from the perspective of
quantum integrable systems. The connection between integrals over classical compact
groups and boundary conditions is also demonstrated in [10]. Finally, there is a com-
plementary approach to identifying scaling dimensions and the central charge of the low
energy theory via ﬁnite size scaling [11, 12, 9] – we will not pursue this, but note that it
would also be accessible from the exact solution of our models.

The bi are the usual complex fermionic operators, and the σi are the Pauli matrices. To

conjugation by R(α) =(cid:81)

The matrix A is Hermitian and traceless, and without loss of generality we take it
to contain only real parameters. We take periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the
fermions1, i.e. bM = b0. As with any quadratic fermion model, we can diagonalise by
the methods of Lieb, Schulz and Mattis [13] – although we will see that after specialising
to our cases of interest that a Fourier transform suﬃces. We will eventually take the
thermodynamic limit M → ∞. This system has a U(1) symmetry. For the spin model
this corresponds to rotations in the XY plane: the action on the spin operators is
2 σz). For the fermions this is a uniform phase shift bj →
exp(iα)bj. In order to express the entanglement entropy and the correlation functions of
the model in a way amenable to random matrix theory techniques we restrict the form
of the matrices A – this is described in detail in Section 4. Essentially we restrict to
either translation invariant (TI) chains, or to half chains where the TI bulk is broken by
a boundary. In all cases we obtain, in the thermodynamic limit, a Hamiltonian of the
form:

j exp(i α

H =

dqΛ(q)ψ†(q)ψ(q)

(5)

(cid:90) π

−π

where ψ(q) is a fermionic annihilation operator – the Fourier transform of the lattice
fermion annihilation operator ψj – and the energy is zero at the Fermi surface. As
the system is non-interacting we have an exact single particle ‘Fermi sea’ picture for our
eigenstates, however Λ(q) may be very general: we can construct any continuous periodic

1We note that this is inequivalent to periodic boundary conditions for the spins, but not drastically.
Diﬀerences are of order 1/M as explained in [13], so in the thermodynamic limit we are calculating
properties of the periodic spin chain.

function that is symmetric in q. (More precisely, an arbitrarily good approximation at
the cost of longer distance interactions.)
An important distinction should be made between two regions in parameter space –
the gapped region where |Λ(q)| is strictly greater than zero and we have a ground state
empty of particles, and a gapless region where Λ(q) has zeroes. The gapless region is
critical (it is at a quantum phase transition for an anisotropic variant of the model (2)
– a generalised XY model – deﬁned in [5]) and is characterised by algebraic decay of
correlation functions, as well as logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. We will
focus our discussion on this gapless region.

3. Physical picture

We will continue schematically, working with the quadratic Hamiltonian (5). The
strategy is to isolate the low energy form of the Hamiltonian by linearisation and to see
that this is consistent. More detailed accounts are given in, for example, [14]; although
much of the literature focuses on the nearest neighbour XX model: Ajk = δ1(j − k) +
δ−1(j − k) + U δ0(j − k), where Λ(q) = cos(q) + U . The aim of this section is to see
how the rigorous results for the entropy and the correlation functions given later can be
argued from a physical perspective. In particular, for the groundstate of the system, we
are interested in computing the leading asymptotic dependence of spin-spin correlation
functions such as (cid:104)σx(N )σx(0)(cid:105) as N → ∞, as well as identifying the central charge
which controls the asymptotics of the entanglement entropy through (1).

3.1. Linearisation and irrelevance of local nonlinear corrections: We have an
oscillatory dispersion which we may linearise about its zeroes (the 1D Fermi surface) to
get:

†
i−(ω, qi)ψi−(ω, qi))

where qi is a coordinate around the ith point of the Fermi surface, which we will label
∂q Λ(q)|θi is the local Fermi velocity. R is the number of zeroes between
θi, and vi = ∂
(0, π). For the RG analysis, we consider the action S(∆), where ω is the Matsubara
frequency, and where we put a uniform cutoﬀ in the energy, ∆, which locally restricts
the momenta to an interval of width 2δi = 2∆/|vi|. The action with unbounded ω would
appear in path integral calculations of zero temperature correlation functions. As Λ(q)
is symmetric, we have pairs of points with equal and opposite velocity as illustrated in
Figure 2; we label these ψi+, ψi− for right and left movers respectively. The approximate
(‘low-energy’) equality is because we are losing all details of the band curvature, and

also, if we allow high energy excitation of the ﬁelds, we are overcounting degrees of
freedom.

We note that it is possible that the linearisation fails – this happens at points where
both Λ and a ﬁnite number of its derivatives vanish. We address this in detail in
Appendix A, but for now we will limit our discussion to the generic case Λ(cid:48)(θi) (cid:54)= 0.

Corrections to the linearised Hamiltonian to account for the approximation do not
aﬀect the low energy physics in which we are interested. Following the discussion in
[15, 16], we ﬁrst note that the action (7) is a ﬁxed point under the following RG trans-
formation: we reduce the cutoﬀ to δi/s, for some s > 1 to reach a new action S(cid:48)(∆/s);
then we rescale (q, ω, ψi±) → (sq, sω, s−3/2ψi±) to restore the cutoﬀ S(cid:48)(∆). For the lin-
earised action we indeed have S(cid:48) = S. The idea now is to see that our original action,
before linearisation but with an energy cutoﬀ, is in the basin of attraction of this ﬁxed
point. To do this we consider diagonal perturbations of the form:

†
i±(ω, qi)µ(ω, qi)ψi±(ω, qi).

dqiψ

(8)

i,±
j,k=0 µjk(iω)jqk, we see that µjk scales as s1−j−k. Hence as we
reduce our cutoﬀ, when j + k ≥ 1 all such perturbations are irrelevant, the coeﬃcient
goes to zero. We are left with µ01 and µ10 which do not change under such a rescaling –
they are called marginal – and their precise value is important. They correspond to the
value of the Fermi velocity, which we ﬁxed from our full Hamiltonian, and we see that
this value does not change under the rescaling so does characterise diﬀerent ﬁxed points.
Hence we have a diﬀerent ﬁxed point for each set of Fermi velocities, and we remark that
this diﬀerence will manifest itself in the correlation functions. Finally the operator µ00
is transformed to sµ00, so grows as we reduce our cutoﬀ – it is relevant and can change
which eﬀective theory we need. This is a change in chemical potential, so naturally
aﬀects which eﬀective theory we’re looking at – by moving the local2 zero of energy we
can remove the degree of freedom entirely by going past a local minimum or maximum,
or less drastically it will change the local Fermi velocity. As we have expanded around

the true zeroes of our dispersion, we do not need need to consider perturbations of this
type.

The conclusion to take from this discussion is that the only important information
from the full nonlinear Hamiltonian is the number of crossings, the Fermi momentum, θi,
at each crossing and the Fermi velocity at each crossing. All of the curvature is irrelevant
as we look at low energies. We need the {θi} to ensure the correct charge density and
relative phases between the diﬀerent Fermi points. We then have universality classes of
Hamiltonians which share these parameters.

We remark that we should work always with some cutoﬀ so as not to allow overcount-
ing of modes at high energy q values, and we need not include couplings between the
diﬀerent modes as our full Hamiltonian is diagonal in q. We have neglected quadratic
perturbations of the type ψ†ψ†, ψψ which break the U(1) fermion number symmetry. Al-
lowing such terms corresponds to considering anisotropic spin chains or superconducting
fermionic chains – these have a gap in the spectrum. Rigorous techniques are used in
[17, 18] to calculate the leading order entanglement entropy for these systems, which is
a constant. Finally we note that the analysis of interacting perturbations leads, as one
would expect, to a much broader class of models with diﬀerent physics to that described
here – however the rigorous techniques used below do not apply directly to such models
so we will not discuss them further.

3.2. The central charge and entanglement entropy. Based on the above discus-
sion, we ﬁx the eﬀective Hamiltonian as (6). To facilitate the CFT method, we note
that:

R(cid:88)

is clearly in the same low energy universality class (we have just extended the high energy
cutoﬀ) and should have the same long distance physical properties. The advantage is
that now we have a real space continuum conformal ﬁeld theory, corresponding to the
continuum limit3 of our chain, and can use textbook methods. We maintain a ﬁxed
density of fermions in our ground state.

We should pay attention to the boundary conditions of the chain that led to (5), and
carry them over to (9). We note that we have a direct sum of 2R chiral fermions, each
with a central charge of 1/2 [19]. In total the model has c = R. Hence on the basis of [1]
we expect the entanglement entropy for a system with PBCs to have the entanglement
entropy of any block of length N to scale as:

S(N ) =

R

log2 N + κΛ + o(1).

For a system with a boundary, irrespective of the boundary condition, we expect:

factors of a are suppressed throughout. Care should be taken in the presence of a boundary, as the
lattice may need to be shifted before this identiﬁcation.

where we consider blocks of length N starting at the boundary. (This choice of block is
motivated by the random matrix theory calculations below - we note that [20] discusses
blocks away from the boundary in that language.)

To interpret these formulae, ﬁrst we see that the constant κΛ is not universal, but
agrees for systems with diﬀerent boundary conditions sharing a (proportional) bulk
dispersion relation Λ(q). Going between (10) and (11) there is a factor of two separating
the ‘bulk terms’ originating in the fact that our block from site 1 to site N has gone from
having two bulk-facing edges to one (this is the |A| in (1)). The scaling by 2N inside the
logarithm is a result of a method of images argument given in [1] - broadly: studying
N sites with a boundary can be mapped into 2N + 1 sites without a boundary, we will
see this in more detail below. We include the bracketed log2(g) for completeness. This
is the boundary entropy introduced in [21], where it is also shown that for free fermions
g = 1 – hence this term will be zero for our systems.

3.3. Spin correlation functions. We can use the eﬀective theory (9) to ﬁnd the
asymptotics of the spin-spin correlation functions by bosonization methods [14, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26]. The aim of this section is to motivate an expected leading asymptotic term,
rather than make an explicit ﬁrst principles derivation.

We defer to the literature for detailed deﬁnitions and discussion, for our purposes we

need the bosonization formula4 [25]:

ψi(x) (cid:39) exp iΦi(x)

Ai+ exp i(ϑi(x) + θix) + Ai− exp−i(ϑi(x) + θix)

;

(12)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where Φi, ϑi are canonical free, massless, bosonic ﬁelds which bosonize each of the
R complex fermions ψi. For each fermion θi is the Fermi momentum and the Ai are
constants. Again, we have a ‘low energy’ equality, i.e.
this is the dominant part of
the operator when calculating long distance correlation functions. Physically exp(iΦi)
creates a unit charge excitation, while ±(θi + ∂xϑi)/π is the relevant charge density
∂Qi/∂x – the expression above is thus analogous to the Jordan-Wigner transformation
(4) for these continuum ﬁelds. For convenience we will also deﬁne the left and right
moving boson ﬁelds:

(13)
Now we argue on general grounds that, to leading order as x → ∞, the spin operator

ϕi± = Φi ± ϑi.

must take the form:

among these. Such operators take the form Vα,γ := exp i(cid:80)

First, we expect by analogy with the single complex fermion XX model case [14] that
we will deal with vertex operators – exponentials of our left and right moving bosonic
ﬁelds. Vertex operators give local expressions for certain non-local operators in the
fermionic degrees of freedom, and the continuum limit of the spin operator must be
i(αiϕi+ + γiϕi−). In order for
Vα,γ to be well deﬁned, we must have that αi − γi ∈ Z and αi + γi ∈ Z. The correlation
functions of such operators are easily derived, giving:

(cid:104)Vα,γ(x)Vα(cid:48),γ(cid:48)(0)(cid:105) =

above. The condition(cid:80)

Clearly, then, the dominant vertex operators in the large x limit have either αi = γi = 0
or αi, γi = ±1/2. The lattice spin operator satisﬁes nontrivial commutation relations
which must carry over to the continuum in each fermion sector, hence we can exclude
the ﬁrst case. This gives us that, to leading order, all ˜βj = ±1/2 in the spin operator
˜βj = 1 is due to the constraint that the spin operator creates
a single particle, or equivalently that it transforms under the U(1) rotation symmetry
in the same way as a single fermion. The condition enforces this by noting that for
ψi → exp(iα)ψi, we have Φi → Φi + α and ϑi → ϑi. Finally, every appearance of ϑi
is through integrating the charge density and so should be accompanied by Qi(x) – the
form of (14) ensures this. The bosonization method cannot give the coeﬃcients so we
assume that they are nonzero.

Then, using (14) and (15), we can give the expected form of the asymptotics for our

This gives us (cid:60)(cid:104)σ+(N )σ−(0)(cid:105)/2 = (cid:104)σx(N )σx(0)(cid:105) = (cid:104)σy(N )σy(0)(cid:105) by the isotropy of the
Hamiltonian (and that there can be no spontaneous breaking of this continuous rotation
symmetry in the ground state by the result of [27]). We note that for every allowed
string {βj} in the sum there is a corresponding string {β(cid:48)
j} with the opposite angle in
the exponential – if we assume |Cβ| = |Cβ(cid:48)| then the right hand side of (17) is real.
This property is veriﬁed in the exact calculation below. Finally we note that physically
this operator is a sum of operators, each of which create and annihilate charges (always
with an overall +1) and create particle-hole excitations. When R is odd we have some
non-oscillating terms which contain only the charged Φi ﬁelds.

5In any particular lattice model this term is removable by a redeﬁnition of the on-site spin basis.
Starting from a ﬁxed basis it should in principle be derived from treating boundary conditions and
branch cuts in the ﬁeld theory carefully, however we will not pursue this here.

fermion number operator. Hence the analogous continuum operator is σz(x) ∼(cid:80)

For completeness, we have from (4) that σz on the lattice is, up to a constant shift, the
i ∂xϑi

from which we quickly see that (cid:104)σz(x)σz(0)(cid:105) ∼ x−2.

We implicitly assumed above that we were working with periodic spatial boundary
conditions. We expect the same asymptotic correlations in the presence of a boundary,
via a method of images argument as in [19]. Note that in the presence of a boundary
we must have a conformally invariant boundary condition, for example ψ(x) = 0 or
ψ(x) = ∞, which respectively correspond to the ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary’ transi-
tions discussed later.

4. Models related to classical compact groups

We will now specialise (2) to three models which encompass all the models labelled
by the classical compact groups introduced in [5]. In the Hamiltonian (2) we separate
for clarity of interpretation the kinetic term with hopping matrix A from the term
proportional to h which acts as a chemical potential for the fermions, or as an external
ﬁeld for the spins. Below, though, we will summarise the whole Hamiltonian by A =
A − 2hI.
4.1. Translation invariant chain. Let: Ajk = a(j − k) where a is an even function
on Z/MZ. Let M be odd, even M is very similar with formulae given in [5]. Deﬁning

δi(j) =

we have:

i = j mod M
i (cid:54)= j mod M

suﬃciently fast that this series converges. This decay is physically natural as αj is a

In this limit we have also, after redeﬁning
particle/hole excitations relative to the Fermi level:

This is the U(N ) model of [5] – the translation symmetry of the chain corresponds
to the translation symmetry of the Haar measure on U(N ). We will see later that

FISHER HARTWIG DETERMINANTS, CFT AND UNIVERSALITY

10

the entanglement entropy and correlation functions are given by Toeplitz determinants
which can be written as integrals over U(N ).

4.2. Semi-inﬁnite chain – ordinary transition. We will now work directly in the
thermodynamic limit, however specialisation to the ﬁnite chain is similar and described
in, for example, [20] where random matrix techniques are used to study the R´enyi entan-
glement entropies in the XX model on open chains. The following is close to the method
of images from diﬀerential equation theory and also to the same method in CFT with a
boundary as explained in [19, Chapter 11].

chain with open boundary conditions (OBCs). We will use this model as an example to
illustrate the main ideas of the calculations given in detail in Appendix B. To diagonalise
this model we introduce the ‘mirrored’ operators B−j := −Bj. Then6:

To make contact with the models and methods of [5, 7] and the canonical Hamiltonian

to simulate the above half chain by introducing the parity odd combination: Bj :=
(bj − b−j)/

In the bj degrees of freedom we now have a non-local Hamiltonian, with hopping between
sites i and j if |i − j| = 1 or if |i + j| = 1. As a ﬁnal step we shift the chain by one
lattice site to align with the model (2) which starts at j = 0 (with a b0 not identically
0) and so send j → j − 1. Hence we see (23) is a particular case of (2) with Ajk =
δ1(|j− k|)− δ1(|j + k + 2|). This is in turn a particular case of the model labelled Sp(2N )
in [5], with hopping matrix given in Table 1. Note that combining the steps above we
also have the spectrum and eigenfunctions of this particular model.
We now assert, with details left to Appendix B, that all of the nonlocal models in
[5] that are related to the groups Sp(2N ), O−(2N + 2), O+(2N + 1) are more naturally

6We also include B0 = −B0 = 0. The factor of two in front of the dispersion is due to the density of

modes and is explained in Appendix B.

transition of a system with a bulk corresponding to some U(N ) model. As a ﬁnal remark
we note that the nonzero expectation value here will manifest itself as the conformally
invariant ψ(0) = ∞ boundary condition in the continuum limit, due to scaling by inverse

description. Then we give the corresponding compact group model of [5], which is
fully speciﬁed by the A matrix in the Hamiltonian (2) and allows rigorous analysis via
random matrix theory methods. We denote the diﬀerent connected components of the
orthogonal group by O+(2N ), O+(2N + 1), O−(2N + 1) and O−(2N + 2) with plus and
minus corresponding to positive and negative determinant respectively.

5. Asymptotics for determinants of Toeplitz matrices

We use this section to recall some results on the generalised Fisher Hartwig conjecture
for asymptotics of certain Toeplitz matrices, and related Toeplitz+Hankel matrices. We
note ﬁrst that a Toeplitz matrix has the form Mjk = Mj−k and a Hankel matrix has the
form Mjk = Mj+k. We will make use of these results in the following section to compute
both the entanglement entropy and the correlators. Originally conjectured by Basor and
Tracy [29], Dieft, Its and Kravsovsky [8] proved the Fisher Hartwig conjecture for the
situations we will now describe. We note that these determinants are often equivalent
to integrals over random matrix distributions, as discussed in [5, 10].

We wish to compute the determinants of matrices with Toeplitz structure, with entries
given by the Fourier coeﬃcients of a function f (z) called the symbol (or generating
function);

DN (f (z)) = det(fj−k)N−1

We will be interested only in symbols whose m singularities are jump discontinuities,

as in Figure 3, thus f (z) can be written in following form on the unit circle:
θ ∈ [0, 2π),

f (z) = eV (z)z

z = eiθ,

and the function V (eiθ) satisﬁes some smoothness conditions, explained in [8].

In general there can be multiple ways of writing this decomposition, each giving
diﬀerent representations of f (z). We will use the nomenclature of [8] and deﬁne these
other representations relative to an initial one in the following way. Start with one such
representation, in terms of a set {βj}, and then modify the right hand side of (28) by
˜βj = βj + nj, subject to the constraint

nj = 0.

(30)

This is called a Fisher-Hartwig representation f (z; n1, . . . nm), relative to the initial
f (z; 0, . . . , 0). Importantly we note that our initial symbol is given by:

f (z) =

znj
j f (z; n1, . . . nm).

(31)

FISHER HARTWIG DETERMINANTS, CFT AND UNIVERSALITY

Example:
In Figure 1 the dispersion is given by:
Λ(θ) = 1 − cos(θ)/2 − 2 cos(3θ),

and the symbol in Figure 3 is:

f (θ) = sign(Λ(θ)).

The symbol has six jump discontinuities, so
we have R = 3. The only other data re-
quired for the Fisher-Hartwig analysis are
the values of θ at the jumps and that f is
negative at zero. We use periodicity to shift
the domain to [0, 2π).

To ﬁnd the leading term of the asymptotics of the determinant we need the subset

image {+ exp(iφ),− exp(iφ)}, for some φ ∈ R, (featuring prominently below) we ﬁnd
2 and nj ∈ {1,−1, 0}.
that these minimal representations have ˜βj = ± 1

We now quote the following theorem, after simpliﬁcations which occur in our cases
of interest. In particular, our symbols will always have V (z) = constant, so the only
Fourier coeﬃcient is V0.

We emphasise that V0 is unaltered when passing between representations. G(z) is
the Barnes G-function [30, §5.17]. For imaginary V0, the dominant behaviour of this
determinant is an algebraic decay. We also note that, using the methods of [8], one
can write Hankel determinants and Toeplitz+Hankel determinants in terms of purely
Toeplitz determinants which can then be put into the full version of the above theorem
– we return to this point below.

6. Random matrix theory results

We see from the results of [5, 7] that for all models discussed in this paper, the
asymptotics of both the entanglement entropy and certain spin-spin correlation functions
may be related to determinants of combinations of Toeplitz and Hankel matrices. The
relevant matrix structure is dictated by Table 1 and the entries of these matrices are

given in terms of Fourier coeﬃcients of the symbol:

Λ(θ)
|Λ(θ)| = sign(Λ(θ)).

f (θ) =

(33)
This is an even function with jump discontinuities taking values ±1. An example is
given in Figure 3. Λ(θ) is the M → ∞ limit of the dispersion relation and d is a
constant, which we see from Table 1 will take values either 0, 1 or 2 for the systems we
are concerned with. We remind the reader that R is the number of zeroes of Λ in (0, π)
and θi are the points where Λ(θi) = 0 (and the ﬁrst nonzero derivative of Λ is odd). The
number of jump discontinuities of our symbol is given by m = 2R. We note that the
fermionic correlators, and hence the σz two point functions, are simply related to the
Fourier coeﬃcients themselves.

6.1. Entanglement. We begin by stating the results from the entanglement computa-
tion in [5]. Thanks to the connection between the reduced density matrix and ground
state correlation functions for one dimensional free fermions noted in [31, 3], we can
relate the entanglement entropy of such a system to the ‘correlation matrix’ - the eigen-
values of which are simply related to the fermionic correlations within the subsystem.
More precisely, the entanglement entropy of a subchain of length N can be shown to be
given by the contour integral:

S(N ) = lim
→0+

This is a result of the residue theorem, as this integral sums the bipartite entanglement

(35)

at each of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix - which are themselves zeroes of the
characteristic polynomial:

DN [f ](λ) = det (λI − MN [f ]) .

(36)
Physics constrains the eigenvalues to lie in [−1, 1], hence we take c(, δ) to be any
curve enclosing the interval [−1, 1] and approaching it as , δ → 0. MN is the rele-
vant Toeplitz+Hankel matrix of Table 1. Note that for the TI chain: MN [f ]jk = fj−k
with symbol deﬁned by (33) – thus DN [f ](λ) is a Toeplitz determinant and has leading
asymptotics given by the relevant extended form of Theorem 1 given in [5]. For the
other groups a diﬀerent proven case of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture was used [10], in
order to deal with Toeplitz+Hankel structures.

By analysing the derivatives of ln DN [f ](λ), and then doing the resulting contour

integrals, Keating and Mezzadri showed the following:

(39)

γE (cid:39) 0.58 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and I3 (cid:39) 0.022 is a deﬁnite integral evalu-
ated in [4].

We can see that (37) and (38) exactly verify the CFT predictions (10) and (11). In
particular we note that the boundary entropy is conﬁrmed to be zero for all of these
models, and we see in (39) the dependence of the constant on ﬁne details of the dispersion
relation – i.e. the values of {θi}.

6.2. Correlation functions. We will now compute the ground state correlators using
the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. For the σz-string correlator we review the correct calcu-
lation given in [7] for the TI chain, as well as giving a partial result for the extension to
systems with a boundary. For the σx and σy correlators we amend an important detail
of the TI calculation in [7] which corrects the constant found there, and discuss why a
similar extension to the chains with a boundary is not straightforward. We note that
the correlators for the XX model were evaluated using the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture in
[26] – our results agree when specialised to this case.

The general method in this section is given in [13]. To summarise: we can rewrite,
say, a two point spin-spin correlation function by the Jordan-Wigner transform as a
fermionic O(N )-point function. As we have a quadratic theory in the fermions, we can
use Wick’s theorem to expand this as a determinant of a matrix of fermionic correlators.
We know these fermionic correlators and so may then use the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture
and related techniques to ﬁnd the asymptotics of the spin-spin correlation functions.

where the matrix MN is deﬁned in Table 1 for each of the diﬀerent models. We use
this for illustration as it is the simplest Fisher-Hartwig type correlator to calculate. The
ﬁeld theory prediction will be as in (14), except as σz does not transform under the U(1)
symmetry we must have that the operator corresponds to no overall charge creation –

i.e. (cid:80) ˜βj = 0. This does not aﬀect the leading order scaling which is N−R/2.

U(N) group/TI chain:

For these systems, the matrix MN is Toeplitz and thus we can directly apply Theorem
1. We ﬁnd there are many representations for the symbol (33) of this matrix, but since
it is of the form described in Section 5, those that are minimal will have ˜βj = ± 1
2 and
nj ∈ {1,−1, 0} along with constraint (30). In order for V (z) to satisfy the smoothness

Here we did not include the extra iπ, i.e. we assume the symbol is positive at zero – this
term would give an additional coeﬃcient (−1)N if included. This is in exact agreement
with the ﬁeld theory calculation, and gives us the coeﬃcients. We also note that by
translation invariance we can take any site as the starting point of our string.
Other groups/chain with boundary:
For systems with a boundary, corresponding to the other classical compact groups, we
still have (40) – but now the matrix MN has a Toeplitz+Hankel structure as dictated
by Table 1. The method to ﬁnd asymptotics of such matrices is outlined in [8] – they are
transformed ﬁrst to Hankel matrices and then to Toeplitz matrices multiplied by certain
orthogonal polynomials. Using the results of the paper, the asymptotics of the Toeplitz
part is controlled by Theorem 1, and the asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials are
derived by the Riemann-Hilbert method, a discussion of which is beyond the scope of
this paper.

A general theorem for Toeplitz+Hankel matrices with symbols containing jump dis-
continuities is not given in [8] – however combining [8, Theorem 1.25 and Remark 1.22],
we have the following:

j (A exp(iF (N )) + o(1)) = N− R

2 (A exp(iF (N )) + o(1)).

(43)

i=0

A is an unknown constant, and F is an unknown real function. Both could in principle,
however, be determined rigorously according to the arguments of [8]. In particular, the
additional Riemann-Hilbert analysis required due to our symbol violating the hypotheses
of [8, Theorem 1.25] only aﬀects the coeﬃcient, and not the leading order algebraic
decay. We also note in the derivation of [8, Theorem 1.25], and in the theorem itself, the

determinant scales as (2N )−R/2 – this is another clear connection with the method of
images and conformal ﬁeld theoretic calculations where we would expect to make such a
replacement. This reasoning applies to all the models with boundary that we consider,
and in each case we get the bulk scaling as we would expect from the ﬁeld theory.

We note that for systems with these Toeplitz+Hankel structures we lack translation

invariance, so this result is restricted to the σz-string on the ﬁrst N sites.

Again for the translation invariant system, the matrix My is Toeplitz and we can

is that the condition on the set of {βj} is

Other groups/chain with boundary

From Table 1 we see that we have a particular Toeplitz+Hankel matrix to deal with.
However, to use the methods of [8] we need to shift the indices on the matrices as above
by multiplying the symbol by an exponential. This means that the symbol is no longer
even in θ so we can no longer use the results of [8] for Toeplitz+Hankel matrices. The
same issue aﬀects the σx correlator.

with positive nearest neighbour hopping on the even and odd sublattices. We ﬁnd V (z)
takes the form

V (z) = i (θ1 (β1 − β4) + θ2 (β2 − β3)) + 2πi (β3 + β4) + iπ,

7. Conclusions and discussion

In this paper we reconciled a rigorous mathematical approach to calculating properties
of spin chains with the intuition gained from more heuristic physical arguments. To do
this we worked within a framework of mathematically tractable models introduced in
[5]. We motivated an eﬀective CFT description of each of these models which gave
predictions consistent with the rigorous calculations. This was particularly informative
after noting that some of the models in [5] represent systems with a boundary. We
then gave the results of rigorous calculations in [5] for the entanglement entropy, and
[7] for the translation invariant correlation functions. We ﬁxed an error in [7] and
gave a partial extension to the expectation of the σz string operator for systems with a
boundary. All of these agreed with the ﬁeld theory expectation. We could not directly
extend this method in the presence of a boundary to the more physically relevant spin-
spin correlation functions, but we note the formal similarity between the Jordan-Wigner
transformed σx and σy operators to the σz string.
It is interesting to compare the
partial result (17) with the full lattice results. Given a more thorough ﬁeld theoretic
calculation perhaps the entire Fisher-Hartwig result could be recovered – for example
we might expect the combinations of sine functions in (51) to come from the theory
of form factors in integrable quantum ﬁeld theories [32, 33]. The universal appearance
of the combination (G(1/2)G(3/2))2 for each complex fermionic ﬁeld suggests this is
simply a normalisation of the ﬁeld operators relative to the normalisation chosen on the
lattice. We also remark that the oscillating prefactor (−1)N which we included in (14)
in an ad-hoc manner is found to be present7 if and only if there is a diﬀerence (±1) in
the number of fermion types with positive vi and those with negative vi in (0, π). If
we imagine a ‘Dirac cone’ where we extend the linearised dispersion to an intersection
at θ = 0 in each fermionic sector, the sign of vi corresponds to a vacuum ﬁlled with
either particles or holes. This picture could be a way of ﬁxing the correct continuum
spin operator, although we could not see how to apply it directly in our heuristics.

To summarise the universality results, we see that for our critical systems in both
the eﬀective theory and the Fisher-Hartwig calculation, the most important feature
aﬀecting the physics is the number of zeroes of the dispersion relation. Interestingly,
both calculations are sensitive to the values of the zeroes, or Fermi momenta, of the
dispersion, but the gradient at these zeroes, or the Fermi velocities, are invisible to the
Fisher-Hartwig analysis. They do, however, feature prominently in the physics – in
particular the spacetime mixing conformal symmetries must act on coordinates (x, vFt).
For this reason, attempting to extend this analysis to dynamic correlators would be an
interesting question. We note that from the boundary CFT perspective, for correlation
functions between sites at the boundary (but displaced in time) we would expect diﬀerent
scaling exponents to the bulk correlators. There is also an interesting question about
the enhanced symmetry for systems where the Fermi velocity is the same at two or more
crossings. This system has a new symmetry at the eﬀective theory level – we can now
mix these diﬀerent fermion sectors – however the lattice results imply that the physics
does not change in this case.

To address universality more precisely, we have rigorously demonstrated diﬀerent

classiﬁcations depending on the macroscopic quantity of interest as follows:

• Classiﬁcation I: The divergence of the entanglement entropy of a block for trans-
lation invariant periodic systems of free fermions which preserve fermion number
(and related spin chains) is universal for systems with the same number of zeroes
of their dispersion.
• Classiﬁcation Ia: The divergence of the entanglement entropy at the boundary
for free fermion systems with a boundary which preserve fermion number and
which have a translation invariant bulk (and related spin chains) is universal for
systems with the same number of zeroes of their dispersion.
• Classiﬁcation II, IIa: The subclass of such systems sharing entanglement entropy
up to O(1) is given by systems with equal Fermi momenta {θi}.
• The leading asymptotics of the equal time spin-spin correlation functions for the

spin chains in Class I have universal scaling and are universal for Class II.

We now make some general remarks on the mathematical methods and further appli-
cability. The Fisher-Hartwig conjecture as proved in [8] relies on a matrix with Toeplitz
structure or some special Toeplitz+Hankel structures.
In the approach above, these
structures correspond to bulk translation invariance. If we restrict to free fermion mod-
els (and related spin chains), the class of microscopic systems we have studied eﬀectively
saturates those with bulk translation invariance. In particular, the ﬁnite chain must be
either a ring or have two open ends and our analysis covers both in the thermodynamic
limit. We would thus need some other rigorous arguments to extend the microscopic uni-
versality classes to systems without translation invariance, but which we would expect
to have the same universal behaviour based on an eﬀective description. Another open
problem would be moving the analysis away from the edge in the case of the open chain
– this would require Toeplitz+Hankel results beyond those given in [8]. The rigorous
analysis above also relied heavily on the fact that our system had a description as a
quadratic fermionic Hamiltonian. This allowed us to write the entanglement entropy in
terms of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, and also allowed us to use Wick’s theorem
to compute correlation functions. Hence we cannot expect to use Fisher-Hartwig type
asymptotics directly in interacting systems.

We note the link between matrix Riemann-Hilbert problems, via the results of [8],
and rigorously providing asymptotics for systems with a CFT description. This may be
unsurprising when we consider the strong links to the theory of diﬀerential equations
from both sides. Other interesting results would follow from solving related Riemann-
Hilbert problems. For example it should also be possible to use the ideas contained in
[34] to understand ﬁnite size eﬀects for our lattice model – i.e. studying long distance
correlation functions before taking the limit M → ∞. In [35] and [36] uniform asymp-
totics are obtained for two merging Fisher-Hartwig singularities and a single emerging
singularity respectively, giving information about the phase transition between diﬀer-
ent asymptotic behaviours. The phase transitions in our model, due to the form of
the symbol, correspond to two singularities emerging at the same time – hence these
results are not directly applicable. It would thus be another interesting open question
to study the case of the simultaneous emergence of two Fisher-Hartwig singularities via
the Riemann-Hilbert method.

21

Finally we remark that we have far from utilised all of the symbols amenable to Fisher-
Hartwig analysis. It would be interesting to see if any other spin chain models could be
connected to symbols with diﬀerent Fisher-Hartwig singularity structures, or indeed if
in general there is a corresponding physical model for each symbol. We would expect a
connection to Bethe ansatz solvable models through the methods contained in [32].

Appendix A. Treatment of points where linearisation fails

We need to consider what happens at an exceptional point θi where Λ(θi) = 0 and
Λ(cid:48)(θi) = 0. At such points we may get diﬀerent critical behaviour. For example in the
XX model in a magnetic ﬁeld, |Λ(q)| = | cos(q) + h|. The model is gapped for |h| > 1,
has two crossings and is linearisable when |h| < 1, but when h = 1 it has a low energy
parabolic dispersion (about q = π) and the eﬀective theory is that of a non-relativistic
massless fermion, which is not a CFT.

FISHER HARTWIG DETERMINANTS, CFT AND UNIVERSALITY

23

We note that the rigorous argument based on the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture is only
sensitive to the following question: does the sign of the dispersion change at the crossing?
If it does - i.e. if the ﬁrst non-zero derivative is odd – then we get identical Fisher-Hartwig
behaviour to a linear crossing at the same point. This can be understood physically in
the following way: an inﬁnitesimal perturbation Λ → Λ± will now have a linear crossing
in the neighbourhood of θi. There is thus stability here – inﬁnitesimally either side of
our exceptional parameters we have a system with n linear crossings – hence we should
expect by continuity that such an eﬀective description still applies at such exceptional
points.

In the case that the ﬁrst non-zero derivative is even, we have an instability of the
type described above for the XX model. An inﬁnitesimal shift changes the number of
crossings, and hence this exceptional point is at a phase transition between diﬀerent
critical theories. Due to the nature of this singularity, the symbol cannot be written in
the general Fisher-Hartwig form [8] at this point, so that form of analysis fails. Hence
we do not seek to describe these transition points in the same terms, and exclude such
exceptional Λ(q) from our discussion. We note that this automatically excludes any
zeroes at q = 0 and q = π by symmetry.

To do the ﬁrst, let us deﬁne B−j := −Bj. Then, as in 4.2, we can write:

As in section 4.2, we need to shift the lattice by one site to see that this is our model
(2) with Ajk = a(j − k) − a(j + k + 2). Hence we see that the half-line model (52) is the
Sp(2N ) model of [5] in full generality. Note that (54) may be transformed to (53) due
to the equivalence Bj = −B−j which carries over to the Fourier transformed operators
†
q |0(cid:105) will have an eigenvalue of 2Λ(q) where
Bq = −B−q. This means any eigenstate B
Λ(q) is the dispersion one would get by naively applying the diagonalisation in (4.1) to
(53). Equivalently one can write the Hamiltonian purely in terms of the independent k
modes, evenly spaced in (−π, π], and send Λ(q) → 2Λ(q) in the process. This doubled
dispersion is seen directly in the diagonalisation carried out in [5] where the same modes
are written twice as densely in the interval [0, π). We prefer (−π, π] as it gives the same
density of states as the translation invariant model when counting the gapless degrees of
freedom. We remark that the initial model (52) is the natural physical interpretation of
all three models in this section, as it is the only one which is local in the thermodynamic
limit.
B.2. O−(2N +2) and O+(2N +1). The structure of the A matrix for the group O−(2N +
2) is identical to that for Sp(2N ) so all of the above applies in exactly the same way.
The fermion chain related to O+(2N + 1) is structurally very similar, but naturally lives
on the half integer sites, i.e. we should shift the labels by j → j(cid:48) = j + 1/2 and then
repeat the above calculation for
a(j − k)B

Alternatively, the O+(2N + 1) chain can be embedded in the Sp(2N ) chain by shifting
the chain by half a lattice space and then relabelling sites by integers j(cid:48) → 2j(cid:48). Both are
consistent with the diagonalisation given in [5]. As we can embed the chain corresponding
to each of these groups in the Sp(2N ) chain, we do not extend the class of models by
including them.

We put B−j := Bj to reach a translation invariant model, and Bj = 1√
(bj + b−j)
to reach the O+(2N ) model of [5]. The only novelty is that the site at zero now has
B0 (cid:54)= 0, and we must include B−0 = B0. This is seen in the O+(2N ) model where the
operator b0 =
2B0 has a heavier weight in calculations (see Table 1). We also note
that this subtlety is seen at the level of the dispersion as well: we should not send the
TI Λ(0) → 2Λ(0) for the {Bk} model (57), but it does appeared doubled in the {bk}
O+(2N ) model.

We may also send j → j + 1/2 and consider the model:

H =

j+1/2Bk+1/2 +

j+1/2Bk+1/2.

Again we obtain a TI model after reﬂection and, with Bj = 1√
(bj + b−j), we reach the
O−(2N + 1) model. As there is no site reﬂected into itself, we do not get any special
weights. These are again in agreement with the diagonalisation in [5].
We note that the connected subgroups of the orthogonal groups containing the neg-
ative of the identity matrix,−I, correspond to systems at the extraordinary transition,
and those not containing −I to systems at the ordinary transition. Finally we remark
that by the addition of a second auxiliary site between the reﬂected site −M and the
boundary site M , the method of images can be used for a ﬁnite system with two bound-
aries. Care should be taken with the quantised momentum for the ﬁnite system, but
the manipulations are otherwise identical. This method is used in [20] to study the XX
model on a ﬁnite chain.
