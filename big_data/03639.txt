HOLOMORPHIC ISOMETRIES FROM THE UNIT BALL INTO

SYMMETRIC DOMAINS

HARALD UPMEIER, KAI WANG AND GENKAI ZHANG

Abstract. We construct isometric holomorphic embeddings of the unit ball into
higher rank symmetric domains, ﬁrst discovered by Mok, in an explicit way using
Jordan triple systems, and prove uniqueness results for domains of rank 2, including
the exceptional domain of dimension 16.

0. Introduction

In a series of papers [8, 9, 11, 10] Mok initiated the study of classifying holomor-
phic isometric mappings from the unit ball Bd in Cd into bounded symmetric domains.
Most known mappings from the unit ball Bd, d > 1, are the natural totally geodesic
embeddings. Recently Mok [7] constructs a new class of non-totally geodesic rational
holomorphic isometric embeddings of the unit ball Bd into a general bounded symmetric
domain D of rank r ≥ 2. There arises a natural question of whether Mok’s mappings
are unique up to composing with automorphisms of D and Bd. In the present paper
we shall give an elementary and explicit construction of Mok’s mappings via the Jordan
algebraic description of bounded symmetric domains [6]. We shall construct a new class
of irrational holomorphic isometric embeddings. When the unit ball Bd, d > 1, is of
co-dimension 1 we prove that all holomorphic isometries are either Mok’s mappings or
the irrational mappings up to reparametrization by the automorphisms of Bd and D. It
turns out indeed that the Jordan theoretic description is quite convenient both for the
construction of holomorphic isometries and for proving their uniqueness.

The topic of holomorphic isometries, and more generally proper holomorphic maps,
between general K¨ahler manifolds is a classical topic in complex geometry; see [1, 18,
12, 15, 2, 13, 16] for the further references and related study.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall some necessary background
and we give an explicit description of the graph of a Bergman isometry in terms of
the Jordan quasi-determinant. In Section 2 we give a construction of the Mok’s rational
mappings in terms of quasi-inverses in Jordan triples. The uniqueness of Mok’s mappings
is proved in Section 3. The classiﬁcation of Bergman isometries from the unit ball Bd
into the Lie ball D(IVd) in Cd+1 is given in Section 4. Finally in Section 5 we give a

diﬀerent proof of the result Mok [8] on extending local holomorphic isometries to global
ones; this result is independent of the rest of the paper.

After a preliminary version of this paper was ﬁnishing we noticed a preprint [20] by
Xiao and Yuan and [3] by Chan and Mok where they also construct irrational isometric
mapping from the unit ball Bd into the Lie ball in Cd+1 and prove that these irrational
mappings combined with the Mok’s rational mappings exhaust all isometric mappings
up to reparametrizations. However their methods are diﬀerent from us. In particular
the uniqueness for non-tube domains is not treated there.

1. Bounded symmetric domains and isometric embeddings

We recall brieﬂy some known facts on bounded symmetric domains and ﬁx notation.
See [5, 6, 19] and references therein for the general background. Let D be an irreducible
bounded symmetric domain in Z = Cm of rank r. Let G be the group of all biholo-
morphic mappings of D. Then D = G/K is a realization of the Hermitian symmetric
space G/K, where K = {g ∈ G; g · 0 = 0} is the isotropic subgroup of 0 ∈ D. The
group G has complexiﬁcation GC acting as rational mappings on Z. We denote K C the
corresponding complexiﬁcation of K.

It is well-known that Z can be equipped with the structure of a hermitian Jordan
triple and D can be then realized as the unit ball in Z; see [6, 19]. We denote the
Jordan triple product by

for all u, v, w ∈ Z, and put

(u, v, w) 7→ {u; v; w}

Qzw := {z; w; z}.

2 with that in [6], namely our {uv∗w} is 1
(Our product {uv∗w} diﬀers by a factor 1
there.) For z, w ∈ Z the Bergman operator B(z, w) ∈ End(Z) is deﬁned by
(1.1)
for all ζ ∈ Z. We have the covariance property
(1.2)
for any h ∈ K C, since this relation is holomorphic in h and holds for h ∈ K, where
h∗ = h−1. It is well-known [6] that the Bergman metric ds2

B(z, w)ζ = ζ − 2{z; w; ζ} + {z;{w; ζ; w}z}

B(h−1z, h∗w) = h−1 Bz,w h

2{uv∗w}

ds2

z(u, v) = hu|viz = hB−1

z,z u|vi

D at z ∈ D is given by

where hu|vi is the K-invariant inner product on Z, normalized by hc|ci = 1 for each
minimal tripotent c ∈ Z. The Bergman kernel for the Bergman space with normalized
Lebesgue measure on D has the form

K D(z, w) = det B(z, w)−1 = ∆(z, w)−p.

(1.3)
Here ∆ : Z×Z → C is a sesqui-holomorphic polynomial called the quasi-determinant
(the exact denominator of the ’quasi-inverse’ deﬁned below.) The numerical invariant
p = 2 + a(r− 1) + b is called the genus of D, and a, b are the characteristic multiplicities
of Z.

Example 1.1. For r ≤ s, the matrix space Z = Cr×s is a hermitian Jordan triple with
triple product

{u; v; w} =

1
2

(uv∗w + wv∗u).

The associated bounded symmetric domain is the matrix unit ball

D = {z ∈ Cr×s : 1 − zz∗ > 0}

of genus p = r + s. The Bergman operator has the form

B(z, w)ζ = (1 − zw∗)ζ(1 − w∗z)

and the quasi-determinant is ∆(z, w) = det(1 − zw∗).
Example 1.2. In the special case r = 1 we obtain the unit ball

B = Bd = {z ∈ Cd : hz|zi < 1}

of genus p = d + 1, where hz|wi =
is given by

dPi=1

ziwi is the inner product. The Bergman operator

B(z, w)ζ = (1 − hz|wi)(ζ − hζ|wiz),

and ∆(z, w) = 1 − hz|wi.
Example 1.3. Let Z = Cp (row vectors) be equipped with the conjugation z 7→ z, and
put z∗ := zt. The Jordan triple product

(1.4)

{u; v; w} = (uv∗)w + (wv∗)u − (uwt)v

makes Z into a hermitian Jordan triple of rank 2 called a spin factor. The corresponding
symmetric domain is the Lie ball

(1.5)

D = {z ∈ Z; (z|z) < 1,

1 − kzk2 + |(z|z)|2 > 0}.

In the reducible case p = 2 the Lie ball is the bidisk.

Lemma 1.4. Let Z = Cp be the spin factor above. In terms of the normalized inner
product

(1.6)

hz|wi = 2zw∗ = 2Xi

ziwi,

the quasi-determinant of the spin factor is given by

(1.7)

where

(1.8)

∆(z, w) = 1 − hz|wi +

Proof. Write ∆(z, w) = 1 − αhz|wi + βhz|zihw|wi for coeﬃcients α, β to be determined.
Any minimal tripotent c has supremum norm 1 and hence belongs to ∂0D. Therefore

0 = ∆(c, c) = 1 − αhc|ci + βhc|cihc|ci = 1 − α

since hc|ci = 1 and hc|ci = 0. It follows that α = 1. On the other hand, any maximal
tripotent e also belongs to ∂0D, being the sum of two orthogonal minimal tripotents.
Moreover, e = ϑe for some constant ϑ ∈ T := {u ∈ C;|u| = 1}; this fact is a consequence
that e = (1, 0,· · · , 0) ∈ Cp is a maximal tripotent and that the group K = O(p) × T
acts transitively on the maximal tripotents. Therefore

0 = ∆(e, e) = 1 − he|ei + βhe|ϑeihϑe|ei = −1 + 4β

since he|ei = 2. This shows that β = 1
4.
Deﬁnition 1.5. A holomorphic map F : B = Bd → D which is an isometry with
respect to the Bergman metric on B and D, resp., F ∗ds2
B, is called an isometric
embedding. Since the Bergman metric for D is expressed via the Bergman operator,
this is equivalent to the condition

D = ds2

(cid:3)

(1.9)

for all x, y ∈ Cd.

hB−1

F (z),F (w)F ′(z)x|F ′(w)yi = hB−1

z,wx|yi

By composing with automorphisms of B or D, which preserve the Bergman metric,
we may always assume that F (0) = 0. Since the Bergman metric at the origin must
agree, this enforces that B and D have the same genus p = d + 1. The Bergman metric
B−1 on the domain B or D is the Hessian of the function log K(z, z) of the Bergman
kernel K(z, z),

B = ¯∂∂ log K(z, z).

It is proved further in [8] that the above equation for the (1.9) for the Hessians is
equivalent to the equation

(1.10)

K D(F (z), F (z)) = K B(z, z),

z ∈ B,

for the kernel functions. This is in turn equivalent to

(1.11)

∆(F (z), F (z)) = 1 − hz|zi,

z ∈ B.

In other words, under the condition that F (0) = 0 the isometric condition is equivalent
to (1.11). A stronger statement is proved also in [8]: If F is holomorphic mapping from
a neighborhood of 0 ∈ B to D such that (1.11) holds, then F extends to an isometry
from B to D. In Section 5 we give also an elementary proof of this fact.

In [8] Mok proves further that the graph GF = {(z, F (z)) : z ∈ B} is algebraic for a
holomorphic isometry F : B → D. That is, there exists a complex-analytic subvariety
V ⊂ Cd × Z of dimension d containing GF . The Jordan theoretic approach makes this
quite explicit and also shows equality V ∩ (B × D) = GF .

Let P(Z) denote the algebra of all (holomorphic) polynomials on Z, endowed with the
Fischer-Fock inner product. For any partition m of length r, the irreducible K-module
Pm(Z) ∈ P(Z), has a reproducing kernel

Em(z, w) = Em

expresses powers of the quasi-determinant ∆ of Z in terms of these kernel functions.
Here (ν)m is the multi-variable Pochhammer symbol. Specializing (1.14) to ν = −1, the
non-zero terms correspond exactly to partitions k := (1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0), with k ones, for
0 ≤ k ≤ r. It follows that

∆(z, w) =

(−1)kE k(z, w),

with Pochhammer symbol (−1)k =
Theorem 1.6. Let F be a holomorphic Bergman isometry from a unit ball B into a
bounded symmetric domain D. Then there exists a complex-algebraic subvariety V ⊂
Cd × Z such that

w2i − hE−w1|E−w2i

∆(w1, w2) = 1 + hE+

w1|E+

for all w1, w2 ∈ Z. Therefore the isometry property ∆(F (z1), F (z2)) = 1 − hz1|z2i is
equivalent to the identity

(1.16)
for all z1, z2 ∈ B. This implies that

hE−F (z1)|E−F (z2)i = hE+

is an algebraic variety which contains the graph GF by construction. Conversely, let
(z0, w0) ∈ V ∩ (B × D). Observe that for any (z, w) ∈ V ∩ (B × D)
w ⊕ zi

hE−w0|E−wi = hUE−w0|UE−wi = hE+

w0 ⊕ z0|E+

= hE+
since U is an isometry. In particular,
∆(w0, w0) = 1 + hE+

w0|E+

wi + hz0|zi

w0|E+

w0i − hE−w0|E−w0i = 1 − hz0|z0i

and

for every z ∈ B. Therefore

hE−w0|E−F (z)i = hE+

w0|E+

F (z)i + hz0|zi

∆(w0, F (z)) = 1 − hE+

w0|E+

F (z)i + hE−w0|E−F (z)i = 1 − hz0|zi

and hence K D(w0, F (z)) = K B(z0, z). Fixing z = z0, we have in the Bergman space

(K D

F (z0)|K D

w0−K D

F (z0)) = K D(w0, F (z0))−K D(F (z0), F (z0)) = K B(z0, z0)−K B(z0, z0) = 0.

Therefore, K D

F (z0)k2 = ∆(w0, w0)−p − ∆(F (z0), F (z0))−p

= (1 − hz0|z0i)−p − (1 − hz0|z0i)−p = 0.

This means w0 = F (z0) and (z0, w0) ∈ GF , completing the proof.
Remark 1.7. Consider the more general case of a ’scaled’ Bergman isometry F : B →
D, satisfying the condition F (0) = 0 and

for some parameter α > 0. It has been shown by Mok that α is a rational number
α = l

j(cid:1)hz|wij, and

expanding ∆(F (z), F (w))l according to (1.14), (1−hz|wi)k =Pk

obtaining a similar equality as (1.16).

2. Rational isometric embeddings: Existence

In this section we construct ’rational’ isometric embeddings in a completely explicit
way, using the Jordan triple approach. A pair (z, w) ∈ Z × Z is called quasi-invertible
if Bz,w is invertible. In this case we have Bz,w ∈ K C and
z,w(z − {z; w; z})

zw := B−1

is called the quasi-inverse. The quasi-inverse map is sesqui-holomorphic in (z, w). For
ﬁxed w ∈ Z the map z 7→ zw is a biholomorphic automorphism of the compact dual ˆZ of
D, with inverse given by z 7→ z−w. An element c ∈ Z is called a tripotent if the Jordan
triple product {c; c; c} = c. Any tripotent c ∈ Z induces a Peirce decomposition

Z = Z 2 ⊕ Z 1 ⊕ Z 0,

HOLOMORPHIC ISOMETRIES FROM THE UNIT BALL INTO SYMMETRIC DOMAINS

7

where Z α := {z ∈ Z : {c; c; z} = 2αz}. For a tripotent c of rank k, the Peirce 2-space
Z 2 is itself an irreducible hermitian Jordan triple of rank k. Let D2 ⊂ Z 2 denote the
corresponding bounded symmetric domain.
Proposition 2.1. Let z = u + v ∈ Z 2 ⊕ Z 1, with u ∈ D2. Then the pair (z, c) is
quasi-invertible, and

B(zc, zc) = B−1

z,c Bc,v Ba,c Bv,cB−1
c,z ,

where a := u+Qcu+2{v; v; c} ∈ Z 2 is the ”real part” of z in the sense of Siegel domains.
Proof. We have cv = c and

Bv,cc = c − 2{v; c; c} + Qv Qcc = c − v + Qvc

since Qcc = {c; c; c} = c. Using the addition formulae in [6, Appendix, A3] this implies

(2.1)

zc = (v + u)c = vc + B−1
v,c (v − Qvc) + B−1

v,c u(cv) = vc + B−1
v,c uc = −c + B−1

= B−1

v,c uc
v,c (c + uc).

The Peirce multiplication rules [6, Theorem 3.13] imply Qvu ∈ Z 0 and Qvv ∈ Z 1. Since
Qc(Z 1 ⊕ Z 0) = 0 it follows that Qc Qvz = Qc Qv(u + v) = 0. Since {c; v; u} = 0 it follows
from [6, JP 35] that

B−1
c,v z = Bcv,−vz = Bc,−vz = u + v + 2{c; v; u + v} + Qc Qvz = u + 2{c; v; v} + v.

Using the addition formulae again we obtain

B(zc, zc) Bc,z = B(c + zc, z) = B(B−1

v,c (c + uc), Bc,v(u + 2{c; v; v} + v))

= B−1

v,c B(c + uc, u + 2{c; v; v} + v)Bv,c

by applying (1.2) to h = Bv,c ∈ K C. Since c + uc = cQcu the addition formula [6, A3]
implies

(c + uc)w = (cQcu)w = cQcu+w

for any w ∈ Z, and [6, JP 33] yields

Bu,c B(c + uc, w) = Bc,Qcu B(c + uc, w) = Bc,Qcu B(cQcu, w) = B(c, Qcu + w).

Putting w := u + 2{c; v; v}, the deﬁnition of a gives

(c + uc)u+2{c;v;v} = cQcu+u+2{c;v;v} = ca

and

Bu,c B(c + uc, u + 2{c; v; v}) = B(c, Qcu + u + 2{c; v; v}) = Bc,a.

Now Bz,c = Bu+v,c = Bu,cv Bv,c = Bu,c Bv,c by [6, JP 34], it follows with [6, JP 34] that

Bz,c B(zc, zc) Bc,z B−1

v,c = Bu,c B(c + uc, u + 2{c; v; v} + v)

= Bu,c B(c + uc, u + 2{c; v; v}) B((c + uc)u+2{c;v;v}, v) = Bc,a Bca,v

= B(c, a + v) = B(c, v + a) = Bc,v B(cv, a) = Bc,v Bc,a.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.2. We have (u + v)c ∈ D if and only if u + Qcu + 2{c; v; v} ∈ D = D ∩ Z 2.

8

HARALD UPMEIER, KAI WANG AND GENKAI ZHANG

Proof. By [6, Corollary 3.15, Theorem 4.1] the domain D is characterized by

D = {ζ ∈ Z : B(ζ, ζ) > 0 positive deﬁnite}.

Now the proposition above implies that B((u+v)c, (u+v)c) > 0 if and only if B(c, a) > 0.
Since a = Qca ∈ Z 2 is self-adjoint, this is equivalent to the condition a ∈ D.
(cid:3)
Proposition 2.3. The quasi-determinant ∆ satisﬁes

∆((u + v)c, (u + v)c) = |∆(u, c)|−2 ∆(a, c).
Proof. The Peirce multiplication rules imply for ζ = ζ2 + ζ1 + ζ0

Bv,cζ = ζ − 2{v; c; ζ2} − 2{v; c; ζ1} + QvQcζ2

with {v; c; ζ2} ∈ Z 1, {v; c; ζ1} ∈ Z 0 and QvQcζ2 ∈ Z 0, while all other components vanish.
It follows that

is a lower triangular matrix with respect to the Peirce decomposition Z = 


Z 2

Therefore we have

det Bv,c = 1.

As a consequence, the operator Bu+v,c = B(u, cv) Bv,c = Bu,c Bv,c satisﬁes

det Bu+v,c = det Bu,c det Bv,c = det Bu,c.

Since ∆(z, w)p = det B(z, w), the assertion follows.


 .

(cid:3)

We now specialize to tripotents c of rank 1. Then Z 2 = C c and D = {uc : u ∈

C,|u| < 1} is a unit disk. Since

dim Z 1 = a(r − 1) + b,

it follows that

dim Z 2 ⊕ Z 1 = 1 + a(r − 1) + b = p − 1.

Since Peirce subspaces are orthogonal, Z 2 ⊕ Z 1 has the inner product huc + v|u′c + v′i =
uu′ + hv|v′i. Hence the unit ball B ⊂ Z 2 ⊕ Z 1 has the Bergman kernel

K(uc + v, u′c + v′) = (1 − uu′ − hv|v′i)−p,

where uc + v ∈ Z 2 ⊕ Z 1.
Theorem 2.4. Let uc + v ∈ Z 2 ⊕ Z 1 with |u| < 1. Then the map
(2.3)

u + 1 (cid:17)c
(u, v) 7→ Gc(u, v) :=(cid:16) uc + v

HOLOMORPHIC ISOMETRIES FROM THE UNIT BALL INTO SYMMETRIC DOMAINS

deﬁnes a holomorphic (Bergman) isometry from the unit ball B ⊂ Z 2⊕ Z 1 into D. More
precisely, we have Gc(u, v) ∈ D if and only if |u|2 +hv|vi < 1, and the quasi-determinant
satisﬁes

∆(Gc(u, v), Gc(u′, v′)) = 1 − uu′ − hv|v′i.

Therefore
K D(Gc(u, v), Gc(u′, v′)) = (∆(Gc(u, v), Gc(u′, v′))−p = (1−uu′−hv|v′i)−p = K B(uc+v, u′c+v′).
Proof. According to Corollary (2.2) we have Gc(u, v) ∈ D if and only if

Multiplying by |u + 1|2 the condition becomes

This is equivalent to |u|2 + hv|vi < 1. The second assertion follows from Proposition
2.3.

(cid:3)

An explicit formula for Gc follows from formula (2.1) and the matrix form (2.2) of

Bv,c. Indeed we have

v ∈ Z 1

Deﬁnition 2.5. An isometric embedding F : B → D ⊂ Z satisfying F (0) = 0 will be
called a Mok embedding if there exists a minimal tripotent c ∈ Z such that F ′(0) is
an isometry from Cd onto Z 2 ⊕ Z 1, and

F (z) = Gc(F ′(0)z)

for all z ∈ B, where Gc is given by (2.3).

In particular the dimensions d = 1 + a(r − 1) and dim Z = r + 1
If F is a Mok embedding, then for any U ∈ U(n) and any k ∈ K = Aut(Z), the
composite k ◦ F ◦ U is again a Mok embedding, with derivative F ′(0) ◦ U and minimal
tripotent kc. In particular, for a constant ϑ ∈ T we may put
(2.6)

2 a(r − 1)r + rb.

Fϑ(z) := ϑF (ϑz)

and obtain a Mok embedding with F ′ϑ(0) = F ′(0) and second derivative F ′′ϑ (0)(v) =
ϑF ′′(0)(ϑv) = ϑF ′′(0)(v), viewed as a quadratic form in v ∈ Cd.

Example 2.6. Consider the special case of matrices Z = Cr×s, including the rectangular
case where r < s. We assume that r > 1, since r = 1 corresponds to the unit ball.
As the construction is invariant under the action of K on Z, we may assume that

c = e1 =(cid:18)1 0

0 0(cid:19) is the ﬁrst matrix unit. Then
Z 2 ⊕ Z 1 = {(cid:18)u v

Example 2.7. By a direct computation the Mok’s mapping f0 : Bd → D is given by
z = z1c1 ⊕ z′ ∈ Cc1 ⊕ Z 1 ⊂ Cc1 ⊕ Z 1 ⊕ Cc2 = Z

f0(z1, z′) = z1c1 + q(z)c2 + z′,

where {c1, c2} is a frame of minimal tripotents and q(z) = (z′,z′)

. Then f0 is an isomet-
ric embedding satisfying the equation for the reproducing kernel (1.11). This class of
mappings has also been constructed in [20] using explicit coordinates.

Remark 2.8. Considering the isometric embedding B2 → B3 : (z1, z2) → (0, z1, z2) and

In [9, 12] it is shown that if F is a non-standard holomorphic isometry F : (△, λds2

△n) from the unit disc into a polydisc then △ F must have a singularity at
some boundary point b ∈ ∂0△. It is asked in [9, Problem 5.2.2] that whether this is
also true for isometric mappings from the unit disc into a bounded symmetric domain.

polynomials maps from the unit disk and also balls into symmetric domains. This

3. Rational isometric embeddings: Uniqueness

As one of the main results of this paper we will classify all rational isometric embed-
dings into symmetric domains of rank 2, including domains not of tube type. Here the
Jordan triple approach is crucial in dealing with the exceptional domain of rank 2. We
ﬁx B = Bd the unit ball in Cd. As a matter of notation we will write

emphasizing that Qvc is a quadratic mapping in v.

Qc(v) := Qvc = {v; c; v}

Theorem 3.1. Let Z be an irreducible hermitian Jordan triple of rank 2. (In particular,
the exceptional Jordan triple of rank 2 is admitted). Let F : B → D ⊂ Z be an isometric
embedding with F (0) = 0. Then F is a Mok embedding (see Deﬁnition 2.5 and (2.6)) if
and only if ∂0

e F ′ = F ′′(0)(e,·) = 0 for some (unit) vector e ∈ Cd.

Observe that the suﬃcient part of the theorem follows immediately from (2.5). The
proof will be divided in a few lemmas, most of them are valid for general isometric
mappings, not just for domains of rank at most 2.

Lemma 3.2. Let F : B → D be a Bergman isometry with F (0) = 0. Then

F (z) − F ′(0)z ∈ Ran F ′(0)⊥

Proof. Let H(z) = F (z) − F ′(0)z. Putting w = 0 we obtain from (1.9)

hx|yi = hF ′(z)x|F ′(0)yi = hF ′(0)x + H′(z)x|F ′(0)yi = hx|yi + hH′(z)x|F ′(0)yi.

Therefore hH′(z)x|F ′(0)yi = 0 for all z ∈ B, showing that Ran H′(z) ⊂ Ran F ′(0)⊥.
Since H(0) = 0, the mean value theorem implies

H(z) =

1Z

0

dt H′(tz)z ∈ Ran F ′(0)⊥.

(cid:3)

Let v1, . . . , vn ∈ Cd be tangent vectors. For a holomorphic function f : B → Z we

use the short-hand notation

∂0
v1,...,vnf := f (n)(0)(v1,· · · , vn),

to denote the n-th derivative f (n)(0) as a symmetric multilinear map f (n)(0) : ⊙nCd → Z.
Similarly, for a sesqui-holomorphic map f (z, w) we denote the mixed derivatives of order
(m, n) by

∂0,0
u1,...,um,v1,...,vnf = f (m,n)(0, 0)(u1, . . . , um, v1, . . . , vn).

For subsets I = {i1, . . . , ik} ⊂ {1, . . . , m}, J = {j1, . . . , jℓ} ⊂ {1, . . . , n} we put uI :=
(ui1, . . . , uik) and (uI, vJ) := (ui1, . . . , uik, vj1, . . . , vjℓ). Note that the vectors u1, . . . , um
or v1, . . . , vn need not be distinct.

Lemma 3.3. Let F, G : B → D be two Bergman isometries preserving the origin, which

BF (z, w)ζ := B(F (z), F (w))ζ = ζ − 2{F (z); F (w); ζ} + {F (z){F (w); ζ; F (w)}F (z)}.

Remark 3.5. We can rewrite the last equation above in terms of the Bergman curvature

reads as

Proof. Regarding F ′′(0) as a linear map from Z 1 ⊗ Z 1 into Z 0, (3.11) can be expressed
as

F ′′(0)∗F ′′(0) = Gc′′(0)∗Gc′′(0).

Since G′′c (0) : Z 1 ⊗ Z 1 → Z 0 is surjective, it follows that

dim Z 0 = rank G′′c (0)∗G′′c (0) = rank F ′′(0)∗F ′′(0).

Therefore F ′′(0) : Z 1 ⊗ Z 1 → Z 0 is also surjective.

The proof of Lemma 3.13 below uses the grid-theoretic approach to Jordan triples [14].
A grid E in an irreducible hermitian Jordan triple Z is a basis consisting of tripotents
with certain combinatorial properties [14, Chapter I.4]. We need the so-called ortho-
collinear grids which contain only minimal tripotents and are characterized by ’quadran-
gles’. By deﬁnition [14, p. 16], an ordered quadruple (e1, e2, e3, e4) of tripotents is called
a quadrangle if ei, ei+1 are collinear, ei, ei+2 are orthogonal and 2{ei; ei+1; ei+2} = ei+3
for all indices i modulo 4. Taking cyclic permutations, reversing the overall order, ex-
changing orthogonal tripotents or replacing orthogonal tripotents by their negatives will
If E is a grid and c ∈ E, then E is compatible with the
again produce quadrangles.
Peirce decomposition relative c. The tripotents wα ∈ E ∩ Z 0 constitute a basis of Z 0.
Let wα, wβ ∈ E ∩ Z 0, and vα, vβ, v ∈ Z 1 ∩ (±E) be tripotents such that {vα; c; vβ} = 0.

Lemma 3.12. Let Z be a hermitian Jordan triple of rank 2 which is not of tube type.
Let c ∈ Z be a minimal tripotent. Then Z is generated by a grid E containing c such that
the elements wα ∈ E ∩ Z 0
c have the following property: For distinct wα, wβ there exist
(non-unique) tripotents vα, vβ, v ∈ Z 1 ∩ (±E) such that (3.17) or (3.18) is an admissible
conﬁguration.

Proof. We check the three diﬀerent types in the classiﬁcation [14, 6].
The rectangular grid for the r × s-matrices Z = Cr×s has minimal tripotents ej

Lemma 3.13. Let Z be a hermitian Jordan triple of rank 2. Then the map U : Z 0 → Z 0
constructed in Corollary 3.9 is a scalar operator, i.e., there exists a constant ϑ ∈ T such
that

Uw = ϑw

for all w ∈ Z 0.
Proof. Let D be an irreducible symmetric domain of rank 2. If D is of tube type (i.e.,
a Lie ball) then dim Z 0 = 1 and the assertion is clear. Thus we may assume that D is
not of tube type. Then dim Z 0 > 1. Choose a grid E speciﬁed in Lemma 3.12. For any
quadrangle (e1, e2, e3, e4) the linear span < e1, e2, e3, e4 > is a Jordan algebra of rank 2,
with unit element e1 + e3, and Jordan algebra determinant

N(ae1 + be2 + ce3 + de4) = ac − bd.

Let P denote the orthogonal projection onto < e1, e2, e3, e4 > . Then (NP )(z) := N(P z)
belongs to P1,1(Z) and hence, by Lemma 3.15, the polarization satisﬁes
(3.19)
for all v ∈ Z 1. In order to show that Uwα =Pβ

U β
α wβ is a diagonal matrix let wα 6= wβ.
Using Lemma 3.12, assume ﬁrst that there is an admissible conﬁguration of type (3.17).
The quadrangle (c, v, wα, vα) shows

gNP (v, UQcv) = 0

Qc(v + vα) = Qc(v) + Qc(vα) + 2{v; c; vα} = wα

since the ﬁrst two terms vanish. Projecting onto the quadrangle (vα, wα, wβ, vβ) yields

0 = gNP (v + vα, UQc(v + vα)) = gNP (v + vα, Uwα) = ˜N(vα, Uwα)

= N(vα + Uwα) = N(vα + U α

α wα + U β

α wβ) = U β
α

since vα has rank 1 and v is perpendicular to vα, vβ. Treating admissible conﬁgurations
of type (3.18) in a similar way shows that U is a diagonal matrix, i.e., Uwα = Uαwα. In
order to show that Uα = Uβ for α 6= β, assume that there is an admissible conﬁguration
of type (3.18). Then
Qc(v+vα+vβ) = Qc(v)+Qc(vα)+Qc(vβ)+2{vα; c; vβ}+2{v; c; vα}+2{v; c; vβ} = wα+wβ
since the ﬁrst four terms vanish. Projecting onto the quadrangle (vα, wα, wβ, vβ) yields

0 = gNP (v+vα+vβ, UQc(v+vα+vβ)) = gNP (v+vα+vβ, U(wα+wβ)) = ˜N(vα+vβ, U(wα+wβ)

= N(vα + vβ + U(wα + wβ)) = N(vα + vβ + Uαwα + Uβwβ) = Uβ − Uα.

since vα + vβ has rank 1 (by collinearity) and v is perpendicular to vα, vβ. Treating
admissible conﬁgurations of type (3.17) in a similar way yields the assertion.

Remark 3.14. The above Lemma can also be proved independently using the 2 × 2-
minors in Jordan triples of rank two. However using the grids is more systematic.

We prove now Theorem 3.1.

Proof. We need only to prove the suﬃcience of the conditon for F. So suppose F satisﬁes
the condition. By Lemma 3.13 there exists a constant ϑ ∈ T such that

v,vF = ϑG′′(0)(v)
∂0

for all v ∈ Z 1, where G = Gc is given by (2.3). By assumption, F ′′(0)(e, z) = 0
for all z ∈ Z 2 ⊕ Z 1. Therefore F agrees up to second order with the Mok embedding
Gϑ(z) = ϑ(G(ϑz)). By Lemma 3.6, we have F = Gϑ.

(cid:3)

Specializing Theorem 3.1 to the case of tube domains D of rank two, i.e. the Lie balls,

and using also Lemma 3.7 we have the following

Corollary 3.15. Suppose F : Bd → D is a Bergman isometry from Bd into the Lie ball
D in Cd+1. Then F is a Mok’s mapping if and only if (RanF ′(0))⊥ = Cξ for a minimal
tripotent ξ.

4. Irrational embeddings into the Lie ball

The symmetric domains of tube type and rank 2 are the Lie balls, Example 1.3. In this
section we construct and classify all isometric holomorphic embeddings from the unit
ball B = Bd into the Lie ball D with dim D = d + 1. Thus B and D have the same genus
p = d + 1. Similar results have also been obtained in [20] using explicit computations.
Let F : B → D be an isometric embedding into the Lie ball, with F (0) = 0.
Lemma 4.1. Suppose ∂0
maximal tripotent.

e,eF 6= 0 for some e ∈ Cd. Then ∂0

e F is a scalar multiple of a

Proof. By rescaling we may assume that k∂0

e Fk = k∂0
2hη|ηiη, we obtain with (3.5)
e,eFk2 + h{η; η; η}|ηi

2|hη|ηi|2.

Therefore hη|ηi = |hη|ηi|, and Cauchy-Schwarz implies η = ϑη for some ϑ ∈ T. There
exists a minimal tripotent e1 such that η = αe1 + βe1, where α > 0 and β ∈ C. Then

η = αe1 + βe1 = ϑη = ϑαe1 + ϑβe1.

By uniqueness in the frame e1, e1 (or linear independence) it follows that β = ϑα. Thus
η = α(e1 + ϑe1) is a multiple of the maximal tripotent e1 + ϑe1.

Theorem 4.2. Let F : B → D be a Bergman isometric embedding into the Lie ball,
with F (0) = 0. Write Ran F ′(0)⊥ = Cξ for a unit vector ξ. If ξ has rank 1 (and
hence is a minimal tripotent) then F is a Mok’s embedding. If ξ has rank 2 (the non-
rational case), then there exist a frame of minimal tripotents e1, e2 ∈ Z and a unimodular
constant ϑ ∈ T such that Fϑ(z) := ϑF (ϑz) has the form
(4.1)

e2 − e1√2 (cid:16)1 −p1 + u2 + he1|e2i hv|vi(cid:17).

e1 + e2√2

Fϑ(u, v) = u

+ v +

Conversely, any such mapping is an isometric embedding.

Proof. By Lemma 3.2, we have

(4.2)
where h : B → C is holomorphic with h′(0) = 0. For all z, w ∈ B it follows from (1.7)
that

F (z) = F ′(0)z + h(z)ξ,

1 − hz|wi = ∆(F (z), F (w)) = 1 − hF (z)|F (w)i + N(F (z))N(F (w))

= 1 − hF ′(0)z + h(z)ξ|F ′(0)w + h(w)ξi + N(F (z))N(F (w))

= 1 − hz|wi − h(z)h(w) + N(F (z))N(F (w)),
since F ′(0) is isometric and ξ is perpendicular to Ran F ′(0). Hence

h(z)h(w) = N(F (z))N(F (w))

for all z, w ∈ B. Thus there exists a constant ϑ ∈ T independent of z such that
N(F (z)) = ϑ · h(z). Replacing F by Fζ(z) := ϑF (ϑz) we may therefore assume that
h(z) = N(F (z)), since N is a quadratic polynomial. If ξ is a minimal tripotent, then
the claim is proved in Corollary 3.15. Now suppose ξ has rank 2. Then there exists
a minimal tripotent c and constants α > 0, ω ∈ C such that ξ = α(ωc − c) Then
η := α(c + ωc) ∈ ξ⊥ = Ran F ′(0) has also rank 2. Writing η = ∂0
e F for some e ∈ Cd
it follows from Lemma 3.7 that ∂0
e,eF 6= 0. By Lemma 4.1 η is a scalar multiple of a
maximal tripotent, which is only possible if |ω| = 1. Since ξ is a unit vector, it follows
that α = 1√2

and hence

(4.3)

ξ =

ωc − c
√2 ∈ Ran F ′(0)⊥, η =

c + ωc
√2 ∈ Ran F ′(0).

Write z ∈ Cd as z = ue + v with u ∈ C, v ∈ e⊥. Identifying Z 1 :=< c, ¯c >⊥=
(Ran F ′(0)) ∩ η⊥ = F ′(0)e⊥ with e⊥ via F ′(0) we have F ′(0)z = uη + v. Since ξ = −ωξ
and η = ωη we obtain
2h(z) = 2N(F ′(0)z + h(z)ξ) = hF ′(0)z + h(z)ξ|F ′(0)z + h(z)ξi = ωu2 + hv|vi − ωh(z)2,
This yields the quadratic equation h(z)2 + 2ωh(z) − ω2u2 − ωhv|vi = 0, with solutions

With (4.3) it follows that

h(z) = −ω ± ωp1 + u2 + ωhv|vi.

Now e1 = c, e2 = ωc runs over all frames of minimal tripotents, and ω = he1|e2i. This
yields (4.1), the choice of ± is uniquely determined by F (0) = 0. Now conversely it
follows from the construction that Fθ(z) is locally deﬁned near z = (u, v) = 0 and
satisﬁes ∆(F (z), F (w)) = 1 − hz|wi. Thus Fθ is a locally Bergman isometry which in
turn extends to an isometry from B to D by Theorem 5.1.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.3. In [9] Mok raised a series of problems on the rigidity of holomorphic
isometries. The local rigidity at a Bergman holomorphic isometry f is deﬁned there by
the following: For any relatively compact open set ∅ 6= U ⊂ B there exists a δ > 0 such
that any Bergman holomorphic isometry h in δ-neighborhood of f , kf − hkL∞(U ) ≤ δ,
must be a reparametrization of f . We remark here the local rigidity does hold for
the Mok’s rational mapping f0. Fix a frame of minimal tripotents {c1, c2} and let
Z = Cc1 ⊕ Cc2 ⊕ Z 1 and B be the unit ball in Cc1 ⊕ Z 1. The mapping f0 : B → D is
then

f0(z) = uc1 + hv|¯vi
1 + u

c2 + v,

z = uc1 + v ∈ B

We let ξ = tc1 + sc2, η = sc1 − tc2 for 0 < t, s < 1, t2 + s2 = 1. The irrational mapping

ft(u, v) = uη ⊕ p(z)ξ ⊕ v,

z = uc1 + v ∈ B

with

pt(z) = −[(s2 − t2)u − 1] −p[(s2 − t2)u − 1]2 + 4ts(tsu2 − hv|¯vi)

2ts

is a Bergman isometry. This is a reparametrization of the mapping Fϑ(z) in Theorem
4.1; its isometric property can also be checked independently by direct computations. A
easy computation shows that when t → 0, ft → f0 uniformly in any compact subset of
the unit ball. Thus the local rigidity at f0 does not hold.

5. Extension of holomorphic isometries

In this ﬁnal section we shall give an elementary proof of a result of Mok [8] on extension
of local isometric mappings to global isometries. The basic operator-theoretic concepts
used in this proof may be useful in more general situations.

Theorem 5.1. [8] Let f : (B, λds2
D; 0) be a germ of holomorphic
isometry with f (0) = 0 between bounded symmetric domain B, D. Then there exists a
proper holomorphic isometric embedding F : B → D extending the germ of holomorphic
map f .

B; 0) → f : (D, ds2

Proof. To ease argument, suppose λ = 1. For a bounded domain Ω ⊂ Cd, let H be a
Hilbert space consisting of analytic functions on Ω which contains all polynomials. A
point z ∈ Cd is called an evaluation point of H if and onlyf the map

τz : p → p(z) ∀polynomials p

is bounded on H. Let vp(H) ⊂ Cd be the set of all evaluation points. For any bounded
symmetric domains Ω, we have vp(L2
a(Ω)) = Ω, which can be proved by some ele-
mentary arguments, which we omit. Let B ⊂ Cd be the unit ball, and let D ⊂ Cn

be an irreducible bounded symmetric domain. Then for any choice of distinct points
z1, . . . , zm ∈ Ω, Ω = D or D, the reproducing kernel matrix A := (K Ω(zi, zj)) is positive
deﬁnite, and hence invertible. This implies that the kernel vectors K Ω

linearly independent. In fact, if Pj

for z, w ∈ B, thus U is isometric on E. Since E is dense in L2
follows that U has a unique extension to an isometry U on L2

f (w)) = K D(f (z), f (w)) = K B(z, w) = (K B

Step 2: Operator on quotient space. Let H = UL2

a(D). For any z ∈ D we have

a(B) = span{K D

f (z) : z ∈ Bδ} ⊂

M∗g K D

z = g(z)K D
z

for g ∈ H∞(D). Hence H is invariant under M∗g and is therefore a quotient module in
a(D). Let P be the orthogonal projection from L2
L2

a(D) onto H. Denote

Sg = P MgP.

Then S∗g = P M∗g P = M∗g P. For any polynomial p and z ∈ Bδ we have

U∗S∗g UM∗p K B

z = p(z)U∗S∗g UK B

z = p(z)U∗S∗g K D

f (z)

= p(z)U∗M∗g K D

f (z) = p(z)g(f (z))U∗K D

f (z) = p(z)g(f (z))K B
z

and, similarly,

M∗p U∗S∗g UK B
= g(f (z))M∗p U∗K D

z = M∗p U∗S∗g K D
f (z) = g(f (z))M∗p K B

f (z) = M∗p U∗M∗g K D

f (z)

z = g(f (z))p(z)K B
z .

By density, it follows that

(U∗S∗g U)M∗p = M∗p (U∗S∗g U).

Therefore U∗SgU commutes with each Mp. Since p is arbitrary, it follows that U∗SgU is
a multiplier on L2
Step 3: Map extension. Choose the coordinate functions w1, . . . , wd on D ⊂ Cd.
Then U∗SwiU is a multiplier on L2

a(B).

a(B). Therefore
U∗SwiU = MFi

for some Fi ∈ H∞(B). Consequently

U∗SqU = Mq ◦F

for any polynomial q on D ⊂ Cd. We claim that F = (F1, . . . , Fd) extends the germ
f = (f1, . . . , fd). Indeed, for each i and z ∈ Bδ, we have

Fi(z)K B

z = M∗FiK B

z = U∗S∗wiUK B

z = U∗S∗wiK D

f (z) = U∗M∗wiK D

f (z) = fi(z)K B
z .

Thus Fi(z) = fi(z)∀i.

Step 4: F is into D. For any z ∈ B, we have to show that the map q → q(F (z)) is

bounded on L2

a(D). Since K B

0 = 1, we have UK B

0 = 1 and
q ◦ F = Mq◦F (1) = U∗SqU(1) = U∗P q.

0 = K D

Therefore, when z ∈ B,

|q(F (z))| ≤ Ckq ◦ FkB = CkU∗P qkB ≤ CkqkD

z = K D

z k → ∞ and hence kK D

F (z)k → ∞, F (z) → ∂0D.

for some positive constant C. This implies F (z) ∈ D.
Step 5: F is proper. A reproducing kernel argument shows that UK B
F (z) for
each z ∈ B, and K B(z1, z2) = K D(F (z1), F (z2)) for any z1, z2 ∈ B. So, if z → ∂0B,
then kK B
Remark 5.2. The steps 4-5 above can also be replaced by the following elementary
argument, namely if f : B → Z is a holomorphic map such that f (0) = 0 and
K D(f (z), f (z)) = K B(z, z) in a neighborhood of 0 ∈ B then f maps B isometrically into
D. Indeed, the equality ∆(f (z), f (z))−p = K D(f (z), f (z)) = K B(z, z) = (1−hz|wi)−p is
valid in a neighborhood of z = 0 ∈ B, thus h(f (z), f (z)) = 1 − hz|zi since pB = pD = p.
Now both sides are real analytic functions in z and thus the equality holds true for all
z ∈ B. Suppose for some z0 ∈ B, f (z0) /∈ D. Then kf (z0)kZ ≥ 1, with k · kZ being
the Jordan norm in Z. Consider the line segment tz0, t ∈ [0, 1] in B from 0 to z0. Then
f (tz0) is a curve from 0 to f (z0). Thus for some 0 < t0 ≤ 1,

(cid:3)

kf (t0z0)k = 1,

namely w0 = f (t0z0) is a boundary point of D. Any boundary point has its Peirce
decomposition of the form

f (t0z0) = w0 = s1c1 + · · · + srcr

with {c1,· · · , cr} being a frame of minimal tripotents and s1 = 1 and 0 ≤ sj ≤ 1, 2 ≤
j ≤ r. Thus hD(w0, w0) = (1− s2
r) = 0, which implies in turn 1− (t0z0|t0z0) =
hD(f (t0z0), f (t0z0)) = hD(w0, w0) = 0. But tz0 is a point in B and 1 − ht0z0|t0z0i0, a
contradiction. The isometry of f now follows from the deﬁnition of the Bergman metric.
