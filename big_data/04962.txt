NONTRIVIAL MINIMAL SURFACES IN A HYPERBOLIC RANDERS SPACE

NINGWEI CUI1, YI-BING SHEN2

Abstract. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. The ﬁrst one is to derive a simple formula
of the mean curvature form for a hypersurface in the Randers space with a Killing ﬁeld, by
considering the Busemann-Hausdorﬀ measure and Holmes-Thompson measure simultaneously.
The second one is to obtain the explicit local expressions of two types of nontrivial rotational
BH-minimal surfaces in a Randers domain of constant ﬂag curvature K = −1, which are the ﬁrst
examples of BH-minimal surfaces in the hyperbolic Randers space.

1. Introduction

The Randers manifold plays a fundamental role in the Finsler geometry. The simply connected
Randers manifolds of constant ﬂag curvature are called the Randers space forms, which were classi-
ﬁed by using the Zermelo’s navigation method in [1]. The minimal surfaces in the ﬂat Randers space
forms ([2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12]) and the positively curved Randers space forms ([4, 5]) have been studied
in recent years. It is a common sense that ﬁnding any explicit minimal surface is an interesting
work in Riemannian geometry. However, due to the complexity of the Finsler geometry, there is no
known minimal surfaces in any negatively curved Finsler space up to the authors’ best knowledge.
The negatively curved Randers space forms will be called hyperbolic Randers space forms in this
paper, and we successfully ﬁnd explicit nontrivial minimal surfaces under the Busemann-Hausdorﬀ
measure in the hyperbolic Randers space form.

The author in [4] gave a formula of the mean curvature form in the Randers space by using the
navigation data (˜h, ˜W ) in the case that ˜W is a Killing ﬁeld of constant length. However, according
to the classiﬁcation of Randers space forms in [1], the hyperbolic Randers space forms are modeled
on the nonpositvely curved Riemannian space forms with conformal (Killing) vector ﬁelds. In view
of this, the formula in [4] in general can not be used to study the hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic
Randers space forms, because of the nonexistence of nontrivial Killing ﬁelds of constant length in
the Riemannian manifold of negative Ricci curvature.

By a straightforward computation, this paper will show that even in the case that ˜W is Killing
only, the mean curvature formulas in the Randers space under both the Busemann-Hausdorﬀ mea-
sure and Holmes-Thompson measure are extremely simple, which generalize the formulas in [4].
Also surprisingly, under the Busemann-Hausdorﬀ measure, the formula enables us to obtain the
explicit local expressions of two types of nontrivial BH-minimal surfaces (spherical and hyperbolic
types) in an open domain of a hyperbolic Randers space form with ﬂag curvature K = −1.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the formula of mean curvature form of a
submanifold immersed in a Randers manifold by using Zermelo’s navigation method (Theorem 2.1).
This formula is applicable for both the Busemann-Hausdorﬀ measure and the Holmes-Thompson
measure, which has a very simple form when considering the hypersurface case and ˜W is Killing
(Theorem 2.5).
In Section 3, we consider an open domain of a hyperbolic Randers space form
(K = −1) with a Killing ﬁeld of mixed S and J type ([1]), and then we obtain the explicit local
expressions of nontrivial BH-minimal surfaces of spherical and hyperbolic types in this domain
(Theorem 3.2).

2. Mean curvature of submanifolds by the method of navigation

In this section, we derive the formula of mean curvature for an n-dimensional submanifold isomet-
rically immersed in an (n + p)-dimensional Randers manifold ( ˜M , ˜F ) with navigation data (˜h, ˜W ),

where (˜h, ˜W ) consists of a Riemannian metric ˜h = q˜hαβd˜xαd˜xβ and a vector ﬁeld ˜W = ˜W α ∂
satisfying k ˜W˜xk˜h < 1 at any point ˜x ∈ ˜M . For the theory of Zermelo’s navigation representation
of Randers metrics, we refer to [1]. In this paper, we shall use the following convention of index
ranges:

∂ ˜xα

1 ≤ i, j,· · · ≤ n;

1 ≤ α, β,· · · ≤ n + p.

Einstein summation convention is also used throughout this paper.

For an isometric immersion f : M n → ( ˜M n+p, ˜F = ˜α + ˜β), the induced metric F = α + β :=
f∗ ˜α+f∗ ˜β on M is also a Randers metric. In local coordinates, f : M n → ( ˜M n+p, ˜F ) can be written
as

(1)

˜xα = f α(x1,· · ·, xn).

For a Finsler metric, there are two classical induced volume forms called Busemann-Hausdorﬀ
volume form and Holmes-Thompson volume form. At each point x ∈ M , the volume form dVF of
the induced metric F with respect to these two volume forms can be written in an uniform way

dVF |x = F (˜x, z)dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxn,
i ) = ( ∂f α

where w = hN, ˜Wi and H is the mean curvature of f with respect to N .
Proof. First, for any vector ﬁeld ˜Y = ˜Y α∂α ∈ T ˜M along f , we have
(33)

h ˜Y , NiN = ˜Yα(˜hαγ − Bαγ)∂γ,

where ˜Yα = ˜hαβ ˜Y β. (See the proof in Page 93 in [4]).

For the index 1 ≤ α ≤ n + 1, recalling that W = W j ∂

we prove the second equation of (29).

The formula (27) is very complicated, but luckily, by using Lemma 2.4, several terms in (27)
can be annihilated and the ﬁnal form seems quite simple. We believe that this formula will play an
important role in the future study of cmc surfaces in Randers space forms.
Theorem 2.5. Let f : M n → ( ˜M n+1, ˜F ) be a hypersurface isometrically immersed in a Randers
manifold. Suppose the navigation data of ( ˜M , ˜F ) is (˜h, ˜W ), where ˜W is a Killing vector ﬁeld. Then
for any ˜X ∈ T ˜M along f , the BH-mean curvature (resp. the HT-mean curvature) of f is given by

Hf ( ˜X) = −

̺nhnH + N (logχ)iΦ(s) − 2hdf (∇w), ˜Wi˜hΦ′(s)ohN, ˜Xi˜h,

where N is a unit normal ﬁeld of f : (M, h) → ( ˜M , ˜h), H is the Riemannian mean curvature with
respect to N , ∇w is the gradient of w with respect to h, w := hN, ˜Wi˜h, s = 1 − w2, χ is given by
(5) and Φ(s) is given by (6), respectively.

Proof: By (4) and (33), we get

s = 1 − (˜hαβ − Bαβ) ˜Wα ˜Wβ = 1 − hN, ˜Wi2 = 1 − w2.

Then by using Theorem 2.2 and Lemma 2.4, we compute

Observing that χ = 1 in the BH-case, we immediately get the following simpler formula, which

enables us to study the BH-minimal surface in the hyperbolic Randers space in the next section.
Corollary 2.6. Let f : M n → ( ˜M n+1, ˜F ) be a hypersurface isometrically immersed in a Randers
manifold. Suppose the navigation data of ( ˜M , ˜F ) is (˜h, ˜W ), where ˜W is a Killing vector ﬁeld. Then
for any ˜X ∈ T ˜M along f , the BH-mean curvature of f is given by

Hf ( ˜X) = −

̺nnHΦ(s) − 2hdf (∇w), ˜Wi˜hΦ′(s)ohN, ˜Xi˜h,

where the notations are the same as those in Theorem 2.5 and Φ(s) is given by (6) in the BH-case.
Remark 2.7. If ˜W is a Killing ﬁeld of constant length, then χ is a constant both in the BH-case
and the HT-case, and the formula in Theorem 2.5 reduces to the same one as in Corollary 2.6,
which is Theorem 3.3 in [4]. This enables us to get both nontrivial BH-minimal surfaces and HT-
minimal surfaces in the Bao-Shen sphere in [5]. Note that when ˜W is Killing only, the formula in
Corollary 2.6 is applicable only for the BH-case.

Let (p1, p2, p3, p4) be the coordinates of L4 with the Lorentzian metric gL4 = −(dp1)2 + (dp2)2 +
(dp3)2+(dp4)2, and let H 3 ⊂ L4 be the model of upper paraboloid −(p1)2+(p2)2+(p3)2+(p4)2 = −1
with p1 > 0. It is well known that the induced metric ˜h on H 3 has constant sectional curvature K˜h =
−1. For ﬁxed numbers ε1 6= 0 and ε2 6= 0, we consider the Killing ﬁeld ˜W = (ε1p2, ε1p1,−ε2p4, ε2p3)
in H 3 which is not of constant length and we call it a Killing ﬁeld of mixed S and J type by using
the terminology in [1]. Note that if ε1 = ε2 6= 0, then ˜W is the scaling of the distinguished Killing
ﬁeld (p2, p1,−p4, p3) in H 3. In order to guarantee k ˜Wk˜h < 1, we consider the domain
2(p3)2 < 1}.

In this section, we shall use Corollary 2.6 to obtain the nontrivial rotational BH-minimal surfaces
in the domain Ω ⊂ H 3 with a Randers metric ˜F whose navigation data is (˜h, ˜W ). By [1], (Ω, ˜F ) is
a regular Randers space of constant ﬂag curvature K ˜F = −1.

The rotational surface of spherical type is parametrized by X : R2 → H 3 ⊂ L4,

(37)

where

X(t, θ) = (x(t), y(t), z(t) cos θ, z(t) sin θ),

x(t) :=p1 + x1(t)2 cosh φ(t),

y(t) :=p1 + x1(t)2 sinh φ(t),

x1(t) 6= 0, and the rotational surface of hyperbolic type is parametrized by X : R2 → H 3 ⊂ L4,
(38)

X(t, θ) = (x(t) cosh θ, x(t) sinh θ, y(t), z(t)),

z(t) := x1(t),

where

x(t) := x1(t),

y(t) :=px1(t)2 − 1 cos φ(t),

and δ = −1 for the hyperbolic case. The rotational surface of spherical type is obtained by rotating
the curve γ(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t), 0), t ∈ R, in H 3 around the p1p2-plane, and the rotational surface of
hyperbolic type is obtained by rotating the curve γ(t) = (x(t), 0, y(t), z(t)), t ∈ R, in H 3 around the
p3p4-plane, respectively. One can check that for both types the parameter t is the parametrization
of arc length with respect to the standard hyperbolic metric, i.e.,
−x′(t)2 + y′(t)2 + z′(t)2 = 1.

Remark 3.1. If δ + x2
1 = 0, then the nontrivial solutions are x1(t) = ± sinh(t + c) for δ = 1
and x1(t) = ± cosh(t + c) for δ = −1, where c is an arbitrary constant. Then, up to a change of
parameters, (37) and (38) reduce to

(39)

and

(40)

X(t, θ) = (cosh t, 0, sinh t cos θ, sinh t sin θ)

X(t, θ) = (cosh t cosh θ, cosh t sinh θ, sinh t, 0),

respectively. They are totally geodesic and so H = 0, and it follows from the equation (43) below
that hdf (∇w), ˜Wi = 0. By Corollary 2.6, they are BH-minimal in (Ω, ˜F ).

In the following, we shall study the rotational surfaces of spherical and hyperbolic types simul-
taneously. We shall consider the minimal surfaces which are not the cases in Remark 3.1 (i.e.
δ + x2

and for the hyperbolic case,

which can be checked directly by computing that hXt, Ni = hXθ, Ni = hX, Ni = 0 and hN, Ni = 1,
where the notations Xt and Xθ denote the derivatives with respect to t and θ, and h,i denotes
the Lorenz metric of L4. A straightforward computation shows that the metric matrix (hij) =
(h∂xiX, ∂xj Xi) of (37) and (38) have the uniform form

The Killing ﬁeld ˜W , restricted to the surface (37) and (38), is respectively given by

˜W = (ε1y(t), ε1x(t),−ε2z(t) sin θ, ε2z(t) cos θ)

and

It follows from (41) and (42) that, for the spherical type,

˜W = (ε1x(t) sinh θ, ε1x(t) cosh θ,−ε2z(t), ε2y(t)).

w = hN, ˜Wi = ε1[−y(y′z − yz′) + x(x′z − xz′)] = ε1[(−x2 + y2)z′ + z(xx′ − yy′)] = −ε1x′1,

and for the hyperbolic type,

w = hN, ˜Wi = ε2[−z(xz′ − x′z) + y(x′y − xy′)] = ε2[(y2 + z2)x′ − x(yy′ + zz′)] = −ε2x′1,

which can be written in the uniform form w = −εkx′1, k = 1, 2, where we are using the identity
−xx′ + yy′ + zz′ = 0, which is derived from −x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 by taking the derivative with respect
to t.

where c is a constant. It is obvious that x1 satisﬁes (44) and then (37) and (38) are really BH-
minimal surfaces in the domain (Ω, ˜F ).

Next, we consider Φ(s) 6= 0. We ﬁrst claim that x′1 is not a constant in any neighborhood of
t. Otherwise, if x′1 is a constant in a neighborhood of t, then x1 = c1t + c2 with c1 and c2 two
constants. Plugging into (44) yields c1 = 0 and 2c2

Theorem 3.2. Let X be the rotational surface of spherical type (37) (resp.
the hyperbolic type

is BH-minimal in (Ω, ˜F ), then it must be one of the following surfaces with intersection of Ω:
(a) X is the totally geodesic surface (39) (resp. (40)) in H 3, up to a change of parameters;
(b) X is given by (37) (resp. (38)) with x1 = ± 1√3εk
(c) X can be locally parametrized as (48) (resp. (49)) with any energy E 6= 0, where δ = 1 (resp.

one gets the same rotational surface of hyperbolic type in Theorem 3.2.
