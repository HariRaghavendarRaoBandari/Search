Abstract. To a diﬀerential graded algebra with coeﬃcients in a noncommutative algebra,
by dualisation we associate an A∞-category whose objects are augmentations. This gener-

1. Introduction

Diﬀerential graded algebras (DGAs for short) were introduced by Cartan in [4] and occur
naturally in a number of diﬀerent areas of geometry and topology. We are here interested in
those that appear in the context of Legendrian contact homology, which is a powerful contact
topological invariant due to Chekanov [6] and Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer [18]. In its basic
setup, this theory associates a diﬀerential graded algebra, called the Chekanov-Eliashberg
DGA, to a given Legendrian submanifold of a contact manifold. The DGA homotopy type
(or even, stable tame isomorphism type) of the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA is independent
of the choices made in the construction and invariant under isotopy through Legendrian
submanifolds. Because of some serious analytical diﬃculties, Legendrian contact homology
has been rigorously deﬁned only for Legendrian submanifolds of contactisations of Liouville
manifolds [15] and in few other sporadic cases [6, 20, 30, 25, 17].

Since the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA is semifree and fully noncommutative, it can be
diﬃcult to extract invariants from it. In fact, as an algebra, it is isomorphic to a tensor
algebra (and therefore is typically of inﬁnite rank) and its diﬀerential is nonlinear with
respect to the generators.

To circumvent these diﬃculties, Chekanov introduced his linearisation procedure in [6]: to
a diﬀerential graded algebra equipped with an augmentation he associates a chain complex
which is generated, as a module, by the generators of the DGA as an algebra. The diﬀer-
ential then becomes linear at the price of losing the information which is contained in the
multiplicative structure of the DGA, but at least the homology of the linearised complex is
computable. It is well known that the set of isomorphism classes of linearised homologies
is invariant under DGA homotopy; see e.g. [1, Theorem 2.8]. Thus, linearised Legendrian
contact homology provides us with a computable Legendrian isotopy invariant.

In order to recover at least part of the nonlinear information lost in the linearisation, one
can study products in the linearised Legendrian contact homology groups induced by the
product structure of the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA.

Civan, Koprowski, Etnyre, Sabloﬀ and Walker in [8] endowed Chekanov’s linearised chain
complex with an A∞-structure. This construction was generalised in [2] by the ﬁrst au-
thor and Bourgeois, who showed that a diﬀerential graded algebra naturally produces an
A∞-category whose objects are its augmentations.
In dimension three, the A∞-category
constructed by the ﬁrst author and Bourgeois admits a unital reﬁnement deﬁned by Ng,
Rutherford, Shende, Sivek and Zaslow in [28].

A∞-algebras are by now classical structures which were ﬁrst introduced by Stasheﬀ in [33]
as a tool in the study of ‘group-like’ topological spaces. Fukaya was the ﬁrst to upgrade the
notion of an A∞-algebra to that of an A∞-category. In [22] he associated an A∞-category,
which now goes under the name of the Fukaya category, to a symplectic manifold. See [31]
for a good introduction. Inspired by Fukaya’s work [22], Kontsevich in [24] formulated the
homological mirror symmetry conjecture relating the derived Fukaya category of a symplectic
manifold to the derived category of coherent sheaves on a “mirror” manifold.

The construction in [8] and [2] deﬁnes A∞-operations only when the coeﬃcient ring of the
DGA is commutative. The goal of this paper is to extend that construction to noncommu-
tative coeﬃcient rings in the following two cases:

(I) the coeﬃcients of the DGA as well as the augmentations are taken in a unital non-

commutative algebra, or

(II) the coeﬃcients of the DGA as well as the augmentations are taken in a noncom-
(See Deﬁnition 2.1.) This case includes both ﬁnite-

mutative Hermitian algebra.
dimensional algebras over a ﬁeld and group rings.

Case (II) is obviously included in Case (I), but we will see that there is a particularly nice
alternative construction of an A∞-structure in case (II) which gives a diﬀerent result. We
refer to Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 for the respective constructions. Both generalisations above
are sensible to study when having Legendrian isotopy invariants in mind, albeit for diﬀerent
reasons.

Case (I) occurs because there are Legendrian submanifolds whose Chekanov-Eliashberg
DGA does not admit augmentations in any unital algebra of ﬁnite rank over a commutative
ring, but admits an augmentation in a unital noncommutative inﬁnite-dimensional one (for
example, in their characteristic algebras). The ﬁrst such examples were Legendrian knots
constructed by Sivek in [32] and, building from them, the second and fourth authors con-
structed higher dimensional examples in [13]. Observe that any diﬀerential graded algebra
has an augmentation in its “characteristic algebra”, introduced by Ng in [29], which is the
quotient of the DGA by the two-sided ideal generated by its boundaries. This algebra is
in general noncommutative and inﬁnite-dimensional, and any augmentation factors through
it.
It is of course possible that the characteristic algebra vanishes, but it does so if and
only if the DGA is acyclic [11]. The complex that we will deﬁne in case (I) (but not the
higher order operations) was used in [12] by the second author in order to deduce that a

Noncommutative augmentation categories

Legendrian submanifold with a non-acyclic Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA does not admit a
displaceble Lagrangian cap.

Finally, we note that the construction we give in Case (I) is closely related to the A∞-
structures and bounding cochains with noncommutative coeﬃcients as introduced by Cho,
Hong and Sui-Cheong in their recent work [7]. Namely, the (uncurved) A∞-structures that
we produce from a DGA and its augmentations can be seen to coincide with the (uncurved)
A∞-structures produced by their bounding cochains.

Case (II) also occurs naturally in the context of Legendrian contact homology. For exam-
ple, in [27] Ng and Rutherford show that augmentations of certain satellites of Legendrian
knots induce augmentations in matrix algebras for the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA of the
underlying knot. Moreover, coeﬃcients in a group ring appear naturally if one considers
the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA with coeﬃcients “twisted” by the fundamental group of the
Legendrian submanifold. We learned this construction from Eriksson- ¨Ostman, who makes
use of it in his upcoming work [19]. This version of Legendrian contact homology can be seen
as a natural generalisation of Morse homology and Floer homology with coeﬃcients twisted
by the fundamental group; see the work [34] by Sullivan and [10] by Damian. In the setting
of Legendrian contact homology with twisted coeﬃcients, an exact Lagrangian ﬁlling gives
rise to an augmentation taking values in the group ring of the fundamental group of the
ﬁlling. See the work [5] by the authors for more details, were Legendrian contact homology
with twisted coeﬃcients is used to study the topology of Lagrangian ﬁllings and cobordisms.
Finally, we recall that Legendrian contact homology is not the only place where noncom-
mutative graded algebras appear in symplectic geometry. Another source is cluster homol-
ogy, a proposed generalisation of Lagrangian Floer homology due to Cornea and Lalonde [9],
which is supposed to provide an alternative approach to the A∞-structures in Floer homology
introduced by Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono [23].

2. Algebraic preliminaries

In this section, we ﬁx some notations and recall some basic deﬁnitions from the theory
of modules over (possibly noncommutative) algebras. For more details of this theory, we
refer to [14]. We also introduce some notation that will simplify the various formulas for the
A∞-structures that we will deﬁne.

2.1. Bimodules and tensor products. In this paper R will always denote a commutative
ring and A will denote a unital algebra over R which is not necessarily commutative. Im-
portant examples will be the matrix algebra Mn(R) corresponding to the endomorphisms of
the free R-module Rn, and the group ring R[G] of an arbitrary group G.

For R-modules M, N we denote by

M ⊗ N := M ⊗R N

their tensor product as R-modules. Moreover, if M, N are A–A-bimodules, their (balanced)
tensor product is denoted by

M ⊠ N := M ⊗A N.

We recall that the balanced tensor product is the quotient of M ⊗ N by ma ⊗ n = m ⊗ an
for all a ∈ A, m ∈ M and n ∈ N.

We also remind that a free A–A-bimodule M on generating set B is an A–A-bimodule M
and a map i : B → M of sets such that, for any A–A-bimodule N and any map f : B → N
of sets, there is a unique A–A-bimodule morphism f : M → N such that f ◦ i = f . The
elements of B = i(B) in M are a basis for M. The free A–A-bimodule with basis B will often
be identiﬁed with ⊕c∈B(A ⊗R A), where the action of A from the left (resp. right) acts by
multiplication from the left (resp. right) on the left (resp. right) factor. Elements of M will
also written as linear combinations of elements of the form a+ca− with a± ∈ A and c ∈ B.

A grading of an A–A-bimodule M in the group Z/Z2µ is a direct sum decomposition
M = ⊕g∈Z/Z2µMg. If m ∈ Mg, we write |m| = g. The tensor product of graded bimodules is
graded by the usual rule.

2.2. Tensor algebras. Given an A–A-bimodule M, we deﬁne the tensor algebra of M as
the algebra

with the multiplication

TA(M) :=

M ⊠n

∞

Mn=0

m((m1 ⊠ . . . ⊠ mi) ⊗ (n1 ⊠ . . . ⊠ nj)) = m1 ⊠ . . . ⊠ mi ⊠ n1 ⊠ . . . ⊠ nj.

m : TA(M) ⊗ TA(M) → TA(M),

Here we have used the notation

We will call M ⊠0 the zero-length part of TA(M).

If M is a graded bimodule, then the tensor algebra TA(M) inherits a grading

M ⊠0 := A,
M ⊠n := M ⊠ . . . ⊠ M

.

n

{z
TA(M) = Mg∈Z/Z2µ

by requiring that the zero-length part lives in degree zero; i.e. M ⊠0 ⊂ TA(M)g and

m : TA(M)g1 ⊗ TA(M)g1 → TA(M)g1+g2.

In this article, algebra maps will always be unital. Algebra maps TA(M) → TA(N) between
tensor algebras over A will always be morphisms of A–A-bimodules, and in particular they
will restrict to the identity A = M ⊠0 → N ⊠0 = A on the zero-length parts. On the other
hand, algebra maps TA(M) → B for a general R-algebra B will be R–R-bimodule morphisms,
and their restriction to M ⊠0 = A induces a unital R-algebra morphisms A → B. Algebra
maps deﬁned on TA(M) are determined by their restrictions to M ⊠0 = A and M ⊠1 = M.

Note that, as in the case when A is commutative, there is a notion of “free product” of

tensor algebras deﬁned by

TA(M) ⋆ TA(N) := TA(M ⊕ N),

which is again a tensor algebra. Moreover, for algebra maps fi : Ai → Bi, i = 1, . . . , n,
between tensor algebras A1, . . . An, B1, . . . Bn, there is a naturally induced algebra map

f1 ⋆ . . . ⋆ fn : A1 ⋆ . . . ⋆ An → B1 ⋆ . . . ⋆ Bn

between the corresponding free products.

In all our applications, M will be a free A–A-bimodules.

In this case, if the elements
c1, . . . , cm, . . . freely generate the A–A-bimodule M, they also generate the algebra TA(M)
in the following sense: every element in M ⊠n can be written as a0ci1a1 . . . cinan, with
a0, . . . , an ∈ A.

2.3. Duals. For an R-module M, we denote by M ∗ the dual module HomR(M, R). If M is
free with a given ﬁnite basis B, then M ∗ is again free with a dual basis B∗ induced by B.
We recall that, for any c ∈ B, the dual basis element c∗ is the element of M ∗ which maps
c to 1 ∈ R and any other element of B to 0. Hence, when the basis is part of the data, we
will identify M to M ∗ by identifying c with c∗ for all c ∈ B. If B is not ﬁnite, the above
construction only gives an injection M → M ∗.

Given a R-module map f : M → N, we denote the adjoint morphism by f ∗ : N ∗ → M ∗.

Again, if M and N are free with given ﬁnite bases, then we denote f ∗ : N → M.

Let A be any R-algebra. We can regard A as a nonfree A–A-bimodule over itself. For an
A–A-bimodule M we will deﬁne M ∨ := HomA−A(M, A) in the sense of bimodules. Observe
that in general M ∨ only has the structure of an R-module.
If M is a free and ﬁnitely
generated A–A-bimodule with a preferred basis B, then M ∨ can be identiﬁed with a free
A-module with the same basis. The correspondence is given by

(2.1)

M ∨ ∋ ϕ 7→Xc∈B

ϕ(c)c.

Again, any morphism f : M → N of bimodules gives rise to an adjoint morphism

f ∨ : N ∨ → M ∨

which, typically, is only a morphism of bimodules.

We deﬁne morphisms of R-modules ψn : (M ∨)⊗n → (M ⊠n)∨ by

(2.2)

ψn(β1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ βn)(m1 ⊠ . . . ⊠ mn) = β1(m1) . . . βn(mm)

6

Chantraine, Dimitroglou Rizell, Ghiggini, Golovko

for βi ∈ M ∨ and mi ∈ M. Note that ψn(β1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ βn) is well deﬁned on the balanced tensor
product since the βi are bimodule morphisms. The maps ψn cannot be seen as morphisms
of bimodules in any sensible way.

If M is graded, then the dual modules M ∗ = HomR(M, R) and M ∨ = HomA−A(M, A)
(when deﬁned) are also graded with gradings (M ∨)g := (Mg−1)∨ and (M ∗)g := (Mg−1)∗,
i.e. the suspension of the dual gradings.

2.4. Hermitian algebras. We are interested in duals HomR(M, R) of A–A-bimodules M
for algebras A which are not necessarily ﬁnitely generated free R-modules. For that reason,
in order to have a better behaving theory, we will introduce some additional structure on
the algebra A.

A commutative ring R is an involutive ring if it is endowed with an involution r 7→ r
(called conjugation), which is also a ring homomorphism. The prototypical example to keep
in mind is the ﬁeld of complex numbers, but we will also allow involutive rings where the
conjugation is the identity. From now on every ring will be tacitly considered involutive,
possibly with a trivial involution.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A Hermitian algebra (A, ⋆, t) over an involutive ring R consists of:

• an R-algebra A,
• a map

⋆ : A → A,

a 7→ a⋆,

satisfying
(1) (ra + sb)⋆ = ra⋆ + sb⋆ for all r, s ∈ R and all a, b ∈ A,
(2) (ab)⋆ = b⋆a⋆, and
(3) (a⋆)⋆ = a, and

• a Hermitian form

such that

t : A × A → R

t(ba, c) = t(a, b⋆c) = t(b, ca⋆)

for all a, b, c ∈ A, and which is non-degenerate in the following strong sense. For any
n ≥ 1, the morphism

1, a1) · . . . · t(a′

is injective.

From (2) and (3) it follows that 1⋆ = 1. In fact a = (a⋆)⋆ = (1a⋆)⋆ = a1⋆, and similarly

a = 1⋆a for all a ∈ A.

Noncommutative augmentation categories

Remark 2.2. There are two cases in which the above non-degeneracy for n > 1 follows from
the case n = 1:

(1) A is free (possibly inﬁnitely generated) as an R-module and t is induced by the

canonical pairing of its basis elements, or

(2) R is a domain.

Note that, if the conjugation on R is trivial, t is a symmetric bilinear form.

Our main examples of Hermitian algebras will be the group ring R[G] over an arbitrary
group G and the matrix algebras Mn(R); in both cases R is an arbitrary commutative ring.
On the group ring the involution is induced by the inverse in G, i.e. g⋆ = g−1 on the basis
elements g ∈ G, and t is the scalar product for which the group elements g ∈ G form an
orthonormal basis. On the matrix algebra Mn(R) we distinguish whether the conjugation
on R is trivial or not. In the ﬁrst case, the involution in Mn(R) is the transposition, and
in the second case it is the adjoint (i.e. the transposition followed by the conjugations). In
both types of matrix algebras,

t(a, b) := tr(b⋆a), a, b ∈ Mn(R)

is given by the trace. For simplicity, from now on we will consider only Hermitian algebras
over commutative rings whose conjugation is trivial.

2.5. Bimodules over Hermitian algebras and their duals. Let M be an arbitrary
A–A-bimodule over a Hermitian algebra A. The involution on A allows us to deﬁne an
A–A-bimodule structure on M ∗ = HomR(M, R) by

(2.3)

(a1ϕa2)(m) := ϕ(a⋆

1ma⋆
2)

for any a1, a2 ∈ A, m ∈ M and ϕ ∈ HomR(M, R).

Lemma 2.3. Let A be a Hermitian algebra and let f : M → N be a morphism between
A–A-bimodules M and N. Then the adjoint map f ∗ : N ∗ → M ∗ is also a morphism of
A–A-bimodules.

Proof. The proof is a simple computation: Let ϕ ∈ N ∗, m ∈ M and a+, a− ∈ A. Then

f ∗(a+ϕa−)(m) = ϕ(a⋆

+f (m)a⋆

−) = ϕ(f (a⋆

+ma⋆

−)) = a+f ∗(ϕ)a−.

Now consider a free A–A-bimodule M with a preferred basis B. The bilinear pairing t on
A and the basis B induce an R-bilinear pairing on each A–A-bimodule M ⊠n, n ≥ 0, which,
on elements of the form a0d1a1 . . . dnan with ai ∈ A and di ∈ B is deﬁned by

holds for all m, n ∈ M ⊠n and a1, a2 ∈ A. By the assumption of nondegeneracy of t, this
pairing then induces an injection

(2.4)

ι(n) : M ⊠n ֒→ (M ⊠n)∗,

m 7→ hm,

i ∈ HomR(M ⊠n, R),

for each n ≥ 0. The identiﬁcations ι(n) also satisfy the following property.

Lemma 2.4. Let A be a Hermitian algebra and let M be a free A–A-bimodule with a preferred
basis. Then the inclusion ι(n) for n ≥ 1 is a morphism of A–A-bimodules for the bimodule
structure on (M ⊠n)∗ described in Equation (2.3).

We will often tacitly identify M ⊠n with its image in (M ⊠n)∗ under the inclusion ι(n). In
general, it is not necessarily the case that an R-module morphism f : M → N between free
inﬁnitely generated R-modules has an adjoint morphism f ∗ : N ∗ → M ∗ that restricts to a
morphism f ∗ : N → M ⊂ M ∗ for these submodules N ⊂ N ∗ and M ⊂ M ∗. However, this
turns out to be the case for a large class of maps that we are interested in here. First we
give the following useful formula.

Lemma 2.5. Let A be a Hermitian algebra, and let M, N be free ﬁnitely generated A–
A-bimodules with preferred bases. Consider a morphism g : M → N ⊠n, n ≥ 1, of A–A-
bimodules which vanishes on all basis elements except a single c ∈ M, on which it takes the
form

g(c) = a0d1a1 . . . dnan,
where di ∈ N again are basis elements and ai ∈ A. Then

Proposition 2.7. Let A be a Hermitian algebra and let M, N be free ﬁnitely generated A–A-
bimodules with preferred bases. Given a morphism f : M → N ⊠n of bimodules where n > 0,
for any k, l ≥ 0 we consider the induced bimodule morphism

F = Id⊠k

M ⊠f ⊠ Id⊠l

M : M ⊠(k+1+l) → M ⊠k ⊠ N ⊠n ⊠ M ⊠l.

Then the adjoint

is a morphism of A–A-bimodules restricting to a morphism of the form

F ∗ : (M ⊠k ⊠ N ⊠n ⊠ M ⊠l)∗ → (M ⊠(k+l+1))∗

on the submodules deﬁned by the inclusion in Equation (2.5).

Proof. The fact that F ∗ is a morphism of A-A-bimodules follows from Lemma 2.3. The

3. Differential graded algebras over noncommutative rings

In this section we recall some facts about diﬀerential graded algebras which are well known

for commutative coeﬃcient rings.

3.1. Deﬁnitions. Let R be a unital commutative ring and A a (not necessarily commuta-
tive) unital algebra over R.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A diﬀerential graded algebra (A, ∂) over A is a unital Z/2µZ-graded algebra
A over A whose diﬀerential ∂ : A → A is a morphism of A–A-bimodules satisfying the
following properties:

(1) ∂ ◦ ∂ = 0,
(2) ∂ has degree −1, and
(3) ∂(xy) = ∂(x)y + (−1)|x|x∂(y) for all homogeneous elements x, y ∈ A.

The last equality is known as graded Leibniz rule, and tells us that ∂ is a derivation. There
|x| ∈ Z/2µZ is the degree of x. The graded Leibniz rule (and the fact that 1 is homogeneous
of degree 0) implies that ∂(1) = 0. In fact, ∂(1) = ∂(1 · 1) = ∂(1) · 1 + 1 · ∂(1) = ∂(1) + ∂(1).
Since ∂ is a morphism of A–A–bimodules, this implies that ∂(a · 1) = 0 for all a ∈ A.

In this article we will consider only “semifree” diﬀerential graded algebras with ﬁnitely

many generators, i.e. whose underlying algebra is the tensor algebra

A = TA(M) =

M ⊠n

∞

Mn=0

where M is a ﬁnitely generated graded free A–A-bimodule. Moreover we will always assume
that M comes with a speciﬁed ﬁnite basis B = {c1, . . . , ck} over A consisting of homogeneous
elements.

The diﬀerential is determined by its action on M, where it decomposes as

(3.1)

∂|M = ∂0 + ∂1 + ∂2 + . . . ,

where ∂n : M → M ⊠n. Clearly ∂i = 0 for i suﬃciently large because M is ﬁnitely generated.
We refer to ∂0 : M = M ⊠1 → M ⊠0 = A as the constant part of ∂. From the Leibniz rule it
follows that the diﬀerential of an element x = a0ci1a1 . . . cinan ∈ M ⊠n is

(−1)|m|m.

3.2. Changing the coeﬃcients. Assume that we are given a diﬀerential graded algebra
with coeﬃcients in A and a morphism A → B of unital R-algebras. In certain situations
it will be useful to consider a change of coeﬃcients from A to B. We recall that B has an
induced structure of an A–A-bimodule and that MB := B ⊠ M ⊠ B is a free B–B-bimodule
for any free A–A-bimodule M.

Lemma 3.2. Let (A, ∂) be a semi-free diﬀerential graded algebra over A such that A is
isomorphic to TA(M) as an algebra, and let f : A → B be a unital algebra morphism. Then
there exist:

• a unique semi-free diﬀerential graded algebra (AB, ∂B) over B such that AB is iso-

morphic to TB(MB) as an algebra, and

• a morphism ˆf : A → AB of unital graded algebras

satisfying the following properties:

(1) ˆf is the natural morphism of unital R-algebras deﬁned uniquely by the requirements
that it restricts to f on M ⊠0 = A, and induces a graded bijection between the gener-
ators of A and AB, and

(2) ˆf ◦ ∂ = ∂B ◦ ˆf ,

i.e. ˆf is a unital DGA morphism.

Proof. The existence of the algebra morphism ˆf is immediate. The diﬀerential ∂B on AB is
deﬁned on the image ˆf (m) ∈ MB of m ∈ M to take the value

∂B( ˆf (m)) = ˆf (∂(m)).

Since ˆf is surjective on the generators of A this determines ∂B uniquely after extending ∂B
using the graded Leibniz rule. Using the Leibniz rule, the fact that ˆf is an algebra morphism
implies that

ˆf ◦ ∂ = ∂B ◦ ˆf

is satisﬁed on all of A.

It remains to check that ∂2

B = 0. Since we clearly have
B ◦ ˆf = ˆf ◦ ∂2 = 0,
∂2

the fact that ˆf is a bijection on the generators implies that ∂2
AB.

B = 0 is satisﬁed on all of

The following changes of coeﬃcients was used in the construction of the augmentation
category in [2], and will also be relevant in this article. Consider the unital R-algebra An :=
i=1 Rei has the ring structure induced by termwise multiplication,

A⊗R (Ln
i.e. ei · ej = δijei and P ei = 1. The morphism f : A → An will be the canonical morphism
induced by the above tensor product withLn

i=1 Rei), whereLn

i=1 Rei, i.e. for which f (1) = e1 + e2 + . . . + en.

3.3. Augmentations and linearisations. The graded Leibniz rule is invariant under con-
jugation by degree-preserving unital algebra automorphisms. More precisely, let φ : A → A
be such an automorphism; then ∂φ := φ−1 ◦ ∂ ◦ φ is a diﬀerential and (A, ∂φ) is again a
diﬀerential graded algebra. We denote by Π0 the projection of A to the zero length part
M ⊠0 = A. The constant part of ∂φ is given by Π0 ◦ φ−1 ◦ ∂ ◦ φ. In particular, if the map
ε := Π0 ◦ φ−1 satisﬁes ε ◦ ∂ = 0, this constant term vanishes. This motivates the deﬁnition
of an augmentation:

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let B be a unital R-algebra together with a unital algebra morphism
f : A → B of R-modules. An augmentation of (A, ∂) into B is a unital DGA morphism
ε : A → B for which ε|M ⊠0 = f . Here B is regarded as a diﬀerential graded algebra with
trivial diﬀerential and concentrated in degree zero. (Therefore ε ◦ ∂ = 0.)

Note that, in particular, ε is a a morphism of A–A-bimodules for the A–A-bimodule structure
on B induced by f .

In [6], Chekanov described a linearisation procedure which uses an augmentation to pro-
duce a diﬀerential on the graded A-module M. While Chekanov originally deﬁned linearisa-
tion for diﬀerential graded algebra over a commutative ring, it is known that his construction
works equally well for diﬀerential graded algebras with noncommutative coeﬃcients. We now
recall this construction.

From a diﬀerential graded algebra (A, ∂) together with an augmentation ε : A → B we
produce a new diﬀerential graded algebra as follows. By applying Lemma 3.2 to ε|M ⊠0 =
f : A → B we obtain a diﬀerential graded algebra (AB, ∂B) with coeﬃcients in B, and using
the unital DGA morphism ˆf : A → AB we deﬁne an augmentation εB : AB → B by the
requirement that εB ◦ ˆf = ε holds on the generators. Using εB we deﬁne a unital algebra
automorphism Φε : AB → AB determined by

Φε(m) = m + εB(m), m ∈ MB.

We obtain a diﬀerential via the conjugation

∂ε := Φε ◦ ∂B ◦ Φ−1
ε .

Let Π0 : AB → M ⊠0
B = εB ◦∂B = 0.
The diﬀerential graded algebra (AB, ∂ε) will be said to be obtained from (A, ∂) by developing
with respect to the augmentation ε.

B = B be the natural projection; then it follows that Π0◦∂ε

3.4. The free n-copy DGA. Let (A, ∂) be a diﬀerential graded algebra. We consider
algebras Aij = A for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n and form a diﬀerential graded algebra (An, d) where An
is, as a graded algebra, the free product

An := ⋆0≤i,j≤nAij,

and the diﬀerential d is induced by ∂ as follows. If c is a generator of A, we denote by cij
the generator in A which corresponds to the copy of c in Aij. Then

• d0(cij) = ∂0(c) ∈ A if i = j, and d0(cij) = 0 if i 6= j, and

n an in d(cij) is equal to the coeﬃcient of a0d1a1d2 . . . dnan

in ∂(c), where di is a sequence of generators, given that i1 = i, jn = j, and jk−1 = ik
are satisﬁed, while this coeﬃcient otherwise vanishes.

As usual, we extend d to the whole algebra An via the graded Leibniz rule. (Since we have not
proved yet that d2 = 0, strictly speaking, (An, d) is only a graded algebra with a derivation
so far.) A generator cij will be called mixed if i 6= j and pure if i = j. Observe that d
preserves the ﬁltration of An given by the R-submodules spanned by those words containing
at least a number m ≥ 0 of mixed generators.

n an will be called composable if jk−1 = ik for 2 ≤ k ≤ n. Words

endomorphism of Ac
n.

To prove that d2 = 0 we use an alternative deﬁnition using the change of coeﬃcients.
i=1 Rei) from the end of Section 3.2. For a semi-free diﬀerential
graded algebra (A, ∂) we denote by (AAn, ∂An) the diﬀerential graded algebra obtained by
the change of coeﬃcients from A to An using Lemma 3.2.

Recall the ring An = A ⊗ (Ln

Recall that there is grading preserving bijection between the sets of generators of the

respective algebras A and AAn.

For a generator c of A we denote eicej ∈ AAn by cij. Note that the cij’s generate AAn,
albeit not freely. The diﬀerential ∂An can now be expressed as follows on any generator c.

appears in the expression ∂An(ci1jn). More generally, we have ∂An(ci1jn) ⊂ ei1AAnejn. Since
eiej = δijei, in particular it follows that ∂Ancij has no constant term for i 6= j.

Lemma 3.4. We have d2 = 0.

Proof. The ﬁrst observation is that it is enough to prove that d2(cij) = 0 for every generator
cij of An. There is an algebra morphism π : An → AAn such that π(cij) = eicej and π(1) =
e1 + . . . + en. It is easy to check that π ◦ d = ∂An ◦ π, and moreover π is injective on the
sub-bimodule Ac
n for every generator cij,
from ∂2
(cid:3)

n generated by composable words. Since d2(cij) ∈ Ac

An = 0 it follows that d2 = 0.

From a sequence ε = (ε0, . . . , εn) of augmentations εi : A → A we deﬁne an algebra

morphism e : An → A such that, on a generator cij of Aij,

e(cij) =(εi(c)

0

if i = j, and
if i 6= j.

Lemma 3.5. The algebra morphism e : An → A is an augmentation.

Proof. It suﬃces to check that e(d(cij)) = 0 holds on the generators. By construction, we
have

e(d(cij)) =(εi(∂(c))

0

if i = j, and
if i 6= j.

which establishes the claim.

(cid:3)

We can use the augmentation e to produce a diﬀerential graded algebra (An, de) whose
diﬀerential has vanishing constant term by applying the procedure described in the previous
subsection.

4. A∞-operations

4.1. Case I: coeﬃcients in a general noncommutative algebra. Let (A, ∂) be a diﬀer-
ential graded algebra with coeﬃcients in a noncommutative algebra A over a commutative
ring R. We further assume that A = TA(M) is a tensor algebra over an free A–A-bimodule
M with a preferred basis {c1, . . . , ck}.

Recall that we decompose ∂|M = ∂0 + ∂1 + . . ., where ∂n : M → M ⊠n. We start without
the assumption that ∂0 = 0. There are induced adjoints (∂n)∨ : (M ⊠n)∨ → M ∨, and we
deﬁne

(4.1)

µn := (∂n)∨ ◦ ψn : (M ∨)⊗n → M ∨, n ≥ 1,

where ψn is as deﬁned in Section 2.3 above. See Diagram (4.2).

=(a0b1a1 . . . an−1bnan,

if ci1 = cj1, . . . , cin = cjn,
otherwise.

Then from

µn(b1ci1, . . . , bncin)(ci) = ψn(b1ci1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ bncin)(∂nci)

for all basis elements ci, and from Equation (2.1) again, the lemma follows.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.2. The maps µn are R-multilinear, but do not satisfy any form of A-linearity in
general.

The maps (µi)i≥1 does not necessarily satisfy the A∞ relations because the curvature term
µ0 := (∂0)∨ : A → M ∨ might be non-vanishing. Given augmentations of A, this can be
amended.

To an augmentation ε : A → A we associate the element

where † = |m1| + · · · + |mi−1| + (i − 1), and m1, . . . , mn ∈ M ∨ are homogeneous elements.
In other words, the above operations form the morphisms and higher operations of an A∞-
category over R whose objects consist of the augmentations ε : A → A.

Proof. First we handle the case when all augmentations are equal and trivial (i.e. sending all
generators to zero). In this case the A∞-relations readily follow from Formula (3.4), which
is satisﬁed when ∂0 = 0. Also, see the following diagram.

The general case can now be reduced to the above case in the following manner. First,
given a sequence ε = (ε, . . . , ε) consisting of a single augmentation, we compute that (µε
i )i≥1
associated to (A, ∂) are equal to the morphisms (µi)i≥1 associated to the DGA (A, ∂ε) deﬁned
in Subsection 3.3. This case thus follows from the above.

Finally, for an arbitrary sequence ε = (ε0, . . . , εn) of augmentations we apply the con-
struction in Section 3.4. Namely, we produce the auxiliary “semisimple” diﬀerential graded
algebra (An, d) and the auxiliary augmentation e : An → A induced by ε. Using the notation
in Section 3.4, it can be seen that

(after identifying the output with an element of Ai1jn = A), where ik < jk and jk = ik+1
holds for all indices k, and di is a sequence of basis elements. We have thus managed to
reduce the general case to the ﬁrst case.

For the sign † it suﬃces to notice that (σ)∨ = −σ according to sign the convention of
(cid:3)

Section 2.3.

4.2. Case II: coeﬃcients in a Hermitian algebra. Let (A, ∂) be a diﬀerential graded
algebra with coeﬃcients in a noncommutative algebra A over a commutative ring R. As in
the previous subsection, we assume that A = TA(M) is a tensor algebra over an free A–A-
bimodule M with a preferred basis {c1, . . . , ck}. In this subsection we make the assumption
that A is a Hermitian algebra. Recall that there are induced inclusions ι(n) : M ⊠n → (M ⊠n)∗
for each n ≥ 0 induced by the basis on M and by the bilinear form t on A.

We deﬁne the A–A-bimodule morphisms

µn := (∂n)∗ : (M ⊠n)∗ → (M)∗

for each n ≥ 1. In view of Proposition 2.7 these morphisms restrict to morphisms µn :=
(∂n)∗ : M ⊠n → M under the above inclusions. However, since ∂0 is not assumed to be zero,
these operations might not give rise to an A∞ structure in the strict sense. We now proceed
to amend this.

Using Lemma 2.5, the operations µn can in this case be expressed more concretely as

follows.

an orthonormal basis, the “bounding cochains”

of the orthonormal basis of A and d1, . . . , dn are elements of the prescribed basis of M (both
allowing repetitions).

As a double check we verify Equation 4.4 for n = 1 using Equation (4.5). If {c1, . . . , ck}
is the basis of M, we denote εi = ε(ci). Then Equation (4.5) for n = 1 can be rewritten as

where a+ and a− run through the orthonormal basis of A. Now we observe that

In other words, the above operations form the morphisms and higher operations of an A∞-

5. A toy example of a DGA

In this section we discuss a toy example which illustrates the two diﬀerent A∞-structures

deﬁned. This example was suggested by Lenny Ng and was an inspiration for this paper.

Let A be an algebra over R = Z/2Z and let g1, g2 be two elements of A which do not (nec-
essarily) commute. We will consider the diﬀerential graded algebra (A, ∂) over A generated
by c1, . . . , c5 and with diﬀerential

∂c1 = c2g1c4 + c3,
∂c2 = c5g2,
∂c3 = c5g2g1c4,
∂c4 = ∂c5 = 0.

It is easily checked that ∂2 = 0. Moreover, ∂0 vanishes and therefore there is a canonical
augmentation which sends every generator to zero.

5.1. The A∞-structure deﬁned in Subsection 4.1 (Case I). The construction of Sub-
section 4.1, performed on the trivial augmentation, gives rise to an A∞-algebra structure on
M ∨ = ⊕5

i=1Aci. Let a, a′ ∈ A. Using Lemma 4.1 we compute the ﬁrst order operations

µ1(ac1) = µ1(ac2) = µ1(ac4) = 0,
µ1(ac3) = ac1,
µ1(ac5) = ag2 · c2,

Noncommutative augmentation categories

21

and the second order operations

µ2(ac2, a′c4) = ag1a′ · c1,
µ2(ac5, a′c4) = ag2g1a′ · c3,

while µ2(aci, a′cj) = 0 whenever (i, j) /∈ {(2, 4), (5, 4)}. Finally, µn ≡ 0 for all n ≥ 3.

We verify that these operations verify the A∞ relations. The only nontrivial relation to

verify (i.e. the only one where not all terms vanish) is

µ1(µ2(a1c5, a2c4)) + µ2(µ1(a1c5), a2c4) + µ2(a1c5, µ1(a2c4)) =

= µ1(a1g2g1a2c3) + µ2(a1g2c2, a2c4) + 0
= a1g2g1a2c1 + a1g2g1a2c1
= 0.

5.2. The A∞-structure deﬁned in Subsection 4.2 (Case II). In this subsection we
assume that A is a Hermitian algebra. The construction of Subsection 4.2, performed on
the trivial augmentation, gives rise to an A∞-algebra structure on M, which we identify to a
submodule of M ∗ by (2.5). Elements in M ⊠n can be written, as usual, as linear combinations
of terms of the form a0ci1a1 . . . an−1cinan, where a0, . . . an ∈ A and ci1, . . . , cin are element of
the prescribed basis of M. Since in case II the operations µn are morphisms of A–A-bimodule,
we will give their values only on elements of the form ci1a1 . . . an−1cin.

Using Lemma 4.6 we compute the ﬁrst order operations

µ1(c1) = µ1(c2) = µ1(c4) = 0,
µ1(c3) = c1,
µ1(c5) = c2g⋆
2

and the second order operations, for all h ∈ A,

µ2(c2hc4) = t(h, g1)c1,
µ2(c5hc4) = t(h, g2g1)c3,

while µ2(cihcj) = 0 in all other cases. Finally, µn ≡ 0 for all n ≥ 3.

The only nontrivial A∞ relation to check is

µ1(µ2(c5hc4)) + µ2(µ1(c5) ⊠ hc4) + µ2(c5h ⊠ µ1(c4)) =

= t(h, g2g1)µ1(c3) + µ2(c2g⋆
= t(h, g2g1)c1 + t(g⋆

= 0

because t(h, g2g1) = t(g⋆

6. Directed systems and consistent sequences of DGAs

Both directed systems and consistent sequences of diﬀerential graded algebras appear
naturally in applications. In this section We discuss brieﬂy how our constructions can be
carried over to these cases.

6.1. The inﬁnitely generated case: a directed system of DGAs. The diﬀerential
graded algebra considered up to this point have all been ﬁnitely generated. For many of the
applications that we have in mind this is also suﬃcient. Namely, the Chekanov-Eliashberg
DGA of a Legendrian submanifold Λ is generated by the Reeb chords of Λ, and a generic
Legendrian submanifold has ﬁnitely many Reeb chords in most contact manifolds for which
the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA is rigorously deﬁned. For example, this is the case closed
Legendrian submanifolds of the standard contact R2n+1.

Nonetheless, for a general contact manifold there may be inﬁnitely many Reeb chords on
a generic closed Legendrian submanifold. In this case then the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA
is inﬁnitely generated, and hence M is a free A–A-bimodule with an inﬁnite preferred basis.
However, note that to every Reeb chord we can associate an action ℓ ∈ R>0, and generically
all Reeb chords below a certain action still comprise a ﬁnite subset. We write M ℓ ⊂ M for
the free and ﬁnitely generated A–A-bimodule spanned by the Reeb chords of action less than
ℓ > 0. We write Aℓ := TA(M ℓ), and the action-decreasing property of the diﬀerential in the
Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA implies that each Aℓ is a sub-DGA of A, and therefore there is
an induced directed system

iℓ1,ℓ2 : (Aℓ1, ∂) ֒→ (Aℓ2, ∂),

ℓ1 ≤ ℓ2,

of ﬁnitely generated diﬀerential graded algebras. The direct limit of this directed system is
the inﬁnitely generated diﬀerential graded algebra (A, ∂) and therefore we can reduce the
study of an inﬁnitely generated graded algebra endowed with an “action ﬁltration” as above
to the study of directed systems of ﬁnitely generated DGAs.

In this setting the A∞-categories obtained by applying the constructions in Subsection 4.1

and 4.2 to the direct system (Aℓ, ∂) form an inverse system; namely we have morphisms

i∨
ℓ1,ℓ2 : (M ℓ2)∨ → (M ℓ1)∨,
i∗
ℓ1,ℓ2 : (M ℓ2)∗ → (M ℓ1)∗,

ℓ1 < ℓ2,

ℓ1 < ℓ2.

Using the given choice of basis of M, the adjoint morphisms i∨
ℓ1,ℓ2 both correspond
to canonical projections onto the submodules spanned by the generators having actions at
most ℓ1. The linearised coboundary maps µε0,ε1 (deﬁned using either of the constructions)
makes the above inverse systems into inverse systems of complexes; i.e. the above projection
maps are chain maps. The Mittag-Leﬄer property be seen to hold for the corresponding
inverse system of boundaries, and hence the inverse limits of homologies is equal to the
homology of the inverse limit complex.

ℓ1,ℓ2 and i∗

The respective A∞-structures constructed for the above inverse system of complexes can

then seen to satisfy i∨
rise to an A∞-structure on the inverse limits of (M ℓ)∨ and (M ℓ)∗.

6.2. Consistent sequences of DGAs. The construction of An and AAn in Section 3.4 out
of A leads to families of diﬀerential graded algebras with an increasing number of genera-
tors. Such sequences were used in [2] to upgrade the A∞ algebra structure from [8] to an
A∞ category whose objects are the augmentations of A. This idea was later generalised
in [28], where the notion of a consistent family of diﬀerentiable graded algebras was intro-
duced. Here we brieﬂy describe this notion and show how it also gives rise to A∞-categories
with noncommutative coeﬃcients. The geometrical construction underlying this algebraic
deﬁnition will be sketched in Appendix A.2.

Let (A, ∂) be a semifree diﬀerential graded algebra over the noncommutative algebra A.
Its underlying algebra is thus the tensor algebra TA(M) over A of a free A–A-bimodule M
with basis B. An (m-components) link grading (as introduced in [26]) on A is a pair of maps
b, e : B → {1, . . . , m} such that:

• If c ∈ B is such that b(c) 6= e(c) then ∂(c) has no constant term, and
• For any c ∈ B and any word a0c1a1 · · · an−1cnan appearing in an expression of ∂(c),

we have b(ci−1) = e(ci).

A generator c ∈ B is called pure if b(c) = e(c) and mixed otherwise. On An and AAn there
is a link grading deﬁned by b(cij) = i and e(cij) = j. Moreover, words a0c1a1 · · · an−1cnan
such that b(ci−1) = e(ci) (i.e. of the type appearing in the diﬀerential of a basis element) are
called composable in [3], [2] and [28]. This terminology comes from the Chekanov-Eliashberg
algebra of an m-components Legendrian link: the components are labeled by {1, . . . , m},
and the maps b and e give the label of the component of the starting point and endpoint
of a Reeb chord of the link. Composable words are those which can appear as negative
asymptotics of a holomorphic disc with boundary on the cylinder over the link.

Let (A, ∂) be a diﬀerential graded algebra equipped with a link grading (b, e) and let I be
a subset of {1, . . . , m}. We denote by AI the subalgebra of A generated by basis elements c
for which b(c), e(c) ∈ I. There is a projection π : A → AI such that, for every basis element,
π(c) = c if (b(c), e(c)) ∈ I × I, and π(c) = 0 otherwise. It follows from the deﬁnition of a link
grading that ∂ descends to a diﬀerential ∂I = π ◦ ∂ on AI. For m-components Legendrian
links this corresponds to taking chords of the sub-link whose components are labeled by I and
deﬁning a diﬀerential which counts only holomorphic discs which are asymptotic to chords
in this sublink. Note that the diﬀerential graded algebra AI is equipped with a link grading
once we identify I with {1, . . . , l} by an order preserving identiﬁcation. When I = {i} we
denote AI simply by Ai.

We give now the deﬁnition of a consistent family of diﬀerential graded algebras following

[28].
Deﬁnition 6.1. A sequence (A(i), ∂(i)) of semi-free diﬀerential graded algebras with gen-
erating sets B(i) and link gradings (b(i), e(i)) taking values in {1, . . . , i} is consistent if the
following properties are satisﬁed.

(1) For every increasing map f : {1, . . . , i} → {1, . . . , j} there is an induced map hf : B(i) →

B(j) such that, for any generator c ∈ B(i), we have

(b(j)(hf (c)), e(j)(hf (c))) = (f (b(i)(c)), f (e(i)(c))).

Figure 2. The 3-copies link as a sublink of the 6-copy link.

(2) For any two composable increasing maps f and g between ﬁnite sets, we have hf ◦g =

hf ◦ hg.

(3) For any f as above, the algebra morphism hf : A(i) → A(j) coinciding with hf on
f ({1,...i}) is an isomorphism of

generators satisﬁes the property that π ◦ hf : A(i) → A(j)
diﬀerential graded algebras.

Note that increasing maps from {1, . . . , i} to {1, . . . , j} are in one-to-one correspondence
with subsets of {1, . . . , j} of cardinality i. Figure 2 shows the geometric meaning of the maps
hf when A(i) is the Chekanov-Eliashberg of the i-copy link of a Legendrian submanifold. See
Appendix A.2.2.

The upshot of this deﬁnition is that, since A(1) is isomorphic to A(i+1)

for any k ∈
{1, . . . , i + 1}, any (i + 1)-tuple of augmentations (ε0, . . . , εi) of A(1) gives rise to an augmen-
tation ε of A(i+1) which vanishes on the mixed generators and satisﬁes ε(c) = εk(c) for any
c ∈ A(i+1)

∼= A(1).

We denote by M (i+1) the free bimodule generated by B(i+1). Also for any subset I of

is identiﬁed with M (i+1)). We decompose each diﬀerential ∂(i+1) restricted to M (i+1) into a

This allows us to deﬁne A∞-categories whose objects are augmentations of A(1), the mor-
phism space between any pair of augmentation is a copy of M (2), and the compositions
are deﬁned by taking adjoints of the maps M (2) → (M (2))⊠i deﬁned in (6.1), using the
construction from either Subsection 4.1 or 4.2.

Note that the procedure described in Section 3.4 which associates to A and n the diﬀeren-
tial graded algebra An produces a consistent sequence of diﬀerential graded algebras whose
link grading is (b(cij), e(cij)) = (i, j). This sequence has the property that M (2) ∼= M (1) = M,
and therefore the augmentation category deﬁned from it contains the same information as
the diﬀerential graded algebra A. However, there exist consistent sequences containing
strictly more information than simply that contained in A = A(1). For instance, even in
the case when A is ﬁnitely generated, an inﬁnite consistent sequence may still give rise an
A∞-category with nontrivial operations of arbitrarily high order. In Appendix A.2 we sketch
the geometric construction of [28], which illustrates such a phenomenon.

Appendix A. The geometric setting

In this appendix, we discuss the geometric motivation of our constructions.

A.1. The Legendrian contact homology with twisted coeﬃcients. Here we give a
very brief sketch of the construction of the diﬀerential graded algebras that arise in Leg-
endrian contact homology. We refer to [6] and [15] for more details. Let Λ ⊂ (Y, α) be a
Legendrian submanifold in a manifold Y with a contact one-form α. The contact one-form
induces the Reeb vector ﬁeld on Y . A Reeb chord of Λ is an integral curves of the Reeb
vector ﬁeld with both endpoints on Λ. Generically, Reeb cords form a discrete set.

We denote MR(Λ) the free graded R-module generated by the Reeb chords of Λ. The
grading is induced by the Conley-Zehnder index of the chords and, in general, takes values
in a cyclic group. For now on we assume that there is only a ﬁnite number of Reeb chords.
In the most basic setting, Legendrian contact homology associates a diﬀerential graded
algebra structure on the tensor algebra TR(MR(Λ)) over R; this is the Chekanov-Eliashberg
DGA. The diﬀerential of a Reeb chord d0 counts the rigid pseudoholomorphic punctured discs
in the symplectisation R × Y , having boundary on the Lagrangian cylinder R × Λ over Λ and
one positive strip-like end asymptotic to d0. For example, a pseudoholomorphic disc as shown

26

Chantraine, Dimitroglou Rizell, Ghiggini, Golovko

in Figure 1 gives a contribution to the coeﬃcient in front of the word d1d2d3d4d5 ∈ (MR(Λ))⊗5
in the expression of ∂(d0).

In [19] Eriksson- ¨Ostman extends the deﬁnition of the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA to a
version with coeﬃcients in the group ring A := R[π1(Λ)]. In this case the underlying graded
algebra is the tensor algebra TA(MA(Λ)), where MA(Λ) is the free graded A–A-bimodule
generated by the Reeb chords of Λ. Fix a choice of capping paths for each end-point of a Reeb
chord, i.e. a path in Λ connecting the end-point with a given base point. Roughly speaking,
the diﬀerential then takes the following form. Assume that a0, a1, . . . , a5 ∈ π1(Λ) in Figure
1 denote the homotopy classes of closed curves corresponding to the canonically oriented
boundary arcs in R × Λ of a pseudoholomorphic disc contributing to the diﬀerential, where
each boundary arc has been closed up by using the corresponding capping path. Then the
depicted disc contributes to the R-coeﬃcient in front of a0d1a1d2a2d3a3d4a4d5a5 ∈ (MA(Λ))⊠5
in the expression ∂(d0).

Remark A.1. Note that the above construction requires that we introduce auxiliary capping
paths in Λ connecting each end-point of a Reeb chord with a given base point. It would be
more natural to replace the fundamental group by the fundamental groupoid, and consider
diﬀerential graded algebras over a groupoid algebra. This generalisation does not require
any new idea, but for simplicity of notation we will only consider group algebras.

A.2. A∞-categories of a Legendrian link. The construction of Section 6.2 allows us to
deﬁne several versions of A∞-categories coming from various consistent sequences of DGAs.

A.2.1. The “negative” augmentation and representation categories. Let Λ be a Legendrian
submanifold such that its Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA (over the appropriate coeﬃcient alge-
bra) admits augmentations. Then, by applying the constructions of Subsections 4.1 and 4.2,
we associate to Λ three A∞-categories which generalise the augmentation category of [2] to
the noncommutative setting. In the terminology of [28] these are the “negative” augmenta-
tion categories.
The category Aug−(Λ, R[π1(Λ)]). Let A(Λ) be the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra of Λ as
deﬁned in Appendix A.2 with coeﬃcients in R[π1(Λ)]. We deﬁne Aug−(Λ, R[π1(Λ)]) as the
A∞-category such that:

(1) Ob(Aug−(Λ, R[π1(Λ)])) is the set of augmentations ε : A → R[π1(Λ)].
(2) For every pair of augmentations ε1, ε2 ∈ Ob(Aug−(Λ, R[π1(Λ)])), the morphism space
Hom(ε1, ε2) is the free R[π1(Λ)]–R[π1(Λ)]-bimodule generated by the Reeb chords of
Λ.

(3) The operations µn, n ≥ 1, are the R[π1(Λ)]–R[π1(Λ)]-bimodule maps

µn : Hom(εn−1, εn) ⊠ Hom(εn−2, εn−1) ⊠ · · · ⊠ Hom(ε0, ε1) → Hom(ε0, εn)

deﬁned in Subection 4.2.

The fact that Aug−(Λ, R[π1(Λ)]) is an A∞-category comes from Theorem 4.11. Let d2 ∈

Hom(ε2, ε3) and d4 ∈ Hom(ε1, ε2). Assuming that ε2(d3) = P akhk, the disc in Figure 3

gives a contribtion of akg−1

to µ2(d2hkd4) for all k.

Hom(ε1, ε2) → Hom(ε1, ε3).

The category Rep(Λ, m). Let A(Λ) be the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra of Λ with coeﬃ-
cients in R. For m ∈ N, we denote by Mm(R) the algebra of m × m matrices with entries in
R. We deﬁne Rep(Λ, m) as the A∞-category such that:

(1) Ob(Rep(Λ, m)) is the set of augmentations ρ : A → Mm(R) (called m-dimensional

representations of Λ).

(2) For every pair of augmentations ρ1, ρ2 ∈ Ob(Rep(Λ, m)), the morphism space Hom(ρ1, ρ2)

is the free Mm(R)–Mm(R)-bimodule generated by Reeb chords of Λ.

(3) The operations µn, n ≥ 1, are the Mm(R)–Mm(R)-bimodule map

µn : Hom(ρn−1, ρn) ⊠ Hom(ρn−2, ρn−1) ⊠ · · · ⊠ Hom(ρ0, ρ1) → Hom(ρ0, ρn)

deﬁned in Subsection 4.2.

From Theorem 4.11 it follows that Rep(Λ, m) is an A∞-category. Assuming that ρ2(d3) is
the matrix with coeﬃcients (aij) and Ei,j denotes the elementary matrix with entries (δi,j),
then the pseudoholomorphic disc in Figure 4 gives a contribution of aijρ3(d1)∗d0ρ1(d5)∗ to
µ2(d2Ei,jd4) for all i, j.
The category Rep−(Λ, S). Given a noncommutative R-algebra S, we deﬁne the category
Rep(Λ, S) such that:

(1) Ob(Rep(Λ, S)) consists of augmentations ρ : A(Λ) → S.
(2) For every pair of augmentations ρ1, ρ2 ∈ Ob(Rep(Λ, m)), morphism space Hom(ρ1, ρ2)

is the free S-module generated by the Reeb chords of Λ

(3) The operations µn, n ≥ 1, are the R-linear maps

µn : Hom(ρn−1, ρn) ⊗ Hom(ρn−2, ρn−1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Hom(ρ0, ρ1) → Hom(ρ0, ρn)

deﬁned in Subsection 4.1.

We can also make hybrid constructions where the Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra is deﬁned
over the group ring of π1(Λ) and the augmentations take values in a matrix algebra Mm(R)
or in a more general noncommutative algebra S.

A.2.2. The “positive” augmentation and representation categories. The consistent sequence
leading to Aug−(Λ) is determined uniquely by A(Λ) as described in [2] (see the discussion at
the end of Section 6.2) and does not require the language of consistent sequences of DGAs.
However, additional geometric input is needed in order to deﬁne Aug+. For a Legendrian
submanifold Λ in the jet space J 1(Q), we denote by Λn the Legendrian link obtained by
taking a generic small perturbation of n-copies of Λ, which we denote by Λ1, . . . , Λn, shifted
in the direction of the Reeb vector ﬁeld by less than the length of the smallest Reeb chords
of Λ divided by n. Note that for any chord c of Λ and pair (i, j) with i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} there
is a corresponding chord di,j of Λn starting on the i-th copy of Λ and ending on the j-th
copy.

The description of the consistent sequence requires some care in the choice of the pertur-
bation of the n-copy link. Let {fn}n∈N be a family of Morse functions on S1 each of which
has only 2-critical points mn and Mn and satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) for any n, there is an inclusion of the oriented intervals (Mn+1, mn+1) ⊂ (Mn, mn)

(i.e. the critical points are nested ).

(2) For any i < j, fi − fj is a Morse function with only two critical points: one maximum

contained in (Mi, Mj) and one minimum in (mj, mi).

Remark A.2. The existence of sequences of Morse functions whose critical points share
similar combinatorics is one technical point that need be resolved to extend the deﬁnition
of Aug+ to Legendrian submanifolds of high dimensions. Some notion of coherent system of
perturbations in the spirit of (but not exactly like) [31] would allow one to extend this setup
and get a well deﬁned category with the correct invariance properties.

Using this perturbation, any chord of the i-copy link becomes a chords of the j-copy link
when {1, . . . , i} is a subset of {1, . . . , j}. The Chekanov-Eliashberg DGAs associated to this
sequence of Legendrian links form a consistent sequence of diﬀerential graded algebras where
A(i) is the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA of the link Λi. The link grading is deﬁned by taking
the beginning and end of Reeb chords; see Figure 2.

Noncommutative augmentation categories

29

This consistent sequence of diﬀerential graded algebra allows us to deﬁne “plus” variants

of the previous “minus” augmentation categories that we now proceed to outline.
The categories Aug+(Λ, R[π1(Λ)]) and Rep+(Λ, n). The objects are the same as in Aug−(Λ, R[π1(Λ)])
and Rep(Λ, n) but the morphisms space are generated by Reeb chords of Λ and critical points
of f1. They can be identiﬁed to mixed chords in Λ2 and therefore the morphism spaces cor-
respond to M (2) in the language of Section 6.2. The operations are deﬁned by applying the
dualisation process of subsection 4.2 to the maps given by equation (6.1).

Figures 3 and 4 show again how to compute such operation: note that in this situation
the (non-augmented) chords d2 and d4 are mixed chords of the 3-copy link and can come
from critical points of the functions fi − fj, the remaining (augmented) chords d1, d3 and d5
are pure chords.
The category Rep+(Λ, S). This is a similar generalisation of Rep−(Λ, S). Again the con-
tribution of a pseudoholomorphic disc is as shown in Figure 1, with the understanding that
possibly some non-augmented chords are mixed (and possibly comes from Morse critical
points).

Remark A.3. It follows from the argument in [28] that the “plus” categories admits a
strict unit (for some particular choices of almost-complex structures), where the unit is
given by m. Though this unit is not necessarily closed in the cases Aug+(Λ, R[π1(Λ)]) and
Rep+(Λ, n) (Case II i.e. Section 4.2), it can be seen to be closed in the case of Rep+(Λ, S)
(Case I i.e. Section 4.1); see [16, Theorem 5.5]. For instance, in the case of Rep(Λ, n), it
follows from the description of holomorphic disks having negative ends asymptotic to the

minimum chord m that the boundary of m is equal to Pc ρ(c)T · m − m · ρ(c)T . Due to

the noncommutativity, the latter expression is possibly nonvanishing whenever ρ(c) is. Note
that the construction in Section 4.1 (Case I) still makes the dual of m a cycle in this case.

Remark A.4. It is possible to deﬁne Aug− by noting that if (b, e) is a link grading then
(e, b) is also a link grading. Applying this change to the link grading of λn, the consistent
sequence leading to Aug+ gives the consistent sequence leading to Aug− because Reeb chords
corresponding to critical points if the Morse functions go in the wrong direction.

A.3. A note about invariance. The invariance properties satisﬁed by the constructions
carried out in this paper will not be discussed in detail. Chekanov-Eliashberg DGA’s are
invariant up to so-called “stable-tame isomorphism”. From this it is not diﬃcult to see that
the set of isomorphism classes of linearised homologies is invariant, as it was originally shown
in [6]. The fact that the coeﬃcients are noncommuting plays no important role in that proof,
and therefore the same result holds in the current setting as well.

Similarly the dual complexes constructed in Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 satisfy the following
invariance property. Consider the so-called “bilinearised co-complexes” (M ∨, µ(ε1,ε2)
) from
Subsection 4.1 or (M, µ(ε1,ε2)
) from Subsection 4.2. The isomorphism classes of their ho-
mologies for all possible pairs of augmentations (ε1, ε2) of A into A is then invariant under
stable-tame isomorphism of the diﬀerential graded algebra A. In fact, since homotopic aug-
mentations (in the sense of DGA morhisms) induce the same bilinearised (co)complex, this

set of isomorphism classes is even invariant under DGA homotopies (see [21, Chapter 26] for
the deﬁnition). We refer to [1, Theorem 2.8] for the proof of a similar statement.

For the invariance properties of the augmentation A∞-categories we refer to [2], which
handles the case when A is commutative. It is shown there that the A∞-categories associated
to two stable-tame isomorphic DGAs are “pseudo equivalent” (see the mentioned article for
this notion). The general case follows similarly. Finally, the invariance of Aug+(Λ) up to
quasi-equivalence follows again from the stable tame isomorphism class of A(Λ) as shown in
[28] and can be easily generalised to noncommutative coeﬃcients.
