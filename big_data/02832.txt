Hadron production within PHSD ∗

We study the production of hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions within
the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach that is
extended to incorporate essentials aspects of chiral symmetry restoration
(CSR) in the hadronic sector (via the Schwinger mechanism) on top of
the deconﬁnement phase transition as implemented in PHSD. The essen-
tial impact of CSR is found in the Schwinger mechanism (for string decay)
which ﬁxes the ratio of strange to light quark production in the hadronic
medium. Our studies provide a microscopic explanation for the maximum
in the K +/π+ ratio at about 30 A GeV which only shows up if in addi-
tion to CSR a deconﬁnement transition to partonic degrees-of-freedom is
incorporated in the reaction dynamics.

1. Introduction

In this contribution we summarize the results from our study in Ref. [1]
that investigates the strangeness enhancement in nucleus-nucleus collisions
[2, 3] or the ’horn’ in the K +/π+ ratio [4, 5]. Previously both phenomena
have been addressed to a deconﬁnement transition. Indeed, the actual ex-
perimental observation could not be described within conventional hadronic
transport theory [6, 7, 8] and remained a major challenge for microscopic
approaches.

2. Extensions in PHSD3.3

Our studies are performed within the PHSD transport approach that
has been described in Refs.
[9, 10]. PHSD incorporates explicit partonic
degrees-of-freedom in terms of strongly interacting quasiparticles (quarks
and gluons) in line with an equation-of-state from lattice QCD (lQCD) as
well as dynamical hadronization and hadronic elastic and inelastic collisions
in the ﬁnal reaction phase.

2.1. Strings in (P)HSD

We recall that in the PHSD/HSD, the high energy inelastic hadron-
hadron collisions in the hadronic phase are described by the FRITIOF model
[11], where two incoming nucleons emerge the reaction as two excited color
singlet states, i.e. ’strings’. The production probability P of massive s¯s or
qq ¯q ¯q pairs is suppressed in comparison to light ﬂavor production (u¯u, d ¯d)
according to the Schwinger-like formula [12], i.e.

with κ ≈ 0.176 GeV2 denoting the string tension and ms, mq = mu = md
Inserting the
the appropriate (dressed) strange and light quark masses.
constituent (dressed) quark masses mu ≈ 0.33 GeV and ms ≈ 0.5 GeV
in the vacuum a value of γs ≈ 0.3 is obtained from Eq.(1). This ratio is
expected to be diﬀerent in a nuclear medium and actually should depend
on the in-medium quark condensate < ¯qq >.

2.2. The scalar quark condensate

As it is well known the scalar quark condensate < ¯qq > is viewed as an
order parameter for the restoration of chiral symmetry at high baryon den-
sity and temperature. A reasonable estimate for the quark scalar condensate
in dynamical calculations has been suggested by Friman et al. [13],

where σh denotes the σ-commutator of the relevant mesons h and ρS the
scalar nucleon density. Furthermore, < ¯qq >V denotes the vacuum conden-
sate, Σπ ≈ 45 MeV is the pion-nucleon Σ-term, fπ and mπ the pion decay
constant and pion mass, respectively.

The basic assumption now is that the strange and light quark masses in

the hadronic medium drop both in line with the ratio (2),

3. Comparison of PHSD3.3 results to A+A data

Incorporating the eﬀective masses (3) into the probability (1), we can
determine the eﬀects of CSR in the production of hadrons by string frag-
mentation. In order to illustrate our ﬁndings we show the ratios K +/π+
and (Λ + Σ0)/π− at midrapidity from 5% central A+A collisions in Fig. 1
as a function of the invariant energy √sN N in comparison to the experimen-
tal data available [14]. The solid (red) lines show the results from PHSD
(including CSR) while the dashed (red) line reﬂects the PHSD results with-
out CSR. It is clearly seen from Fig. 1 that the results in the conventional
scenario (without incorporating the CSR) clearly underestimate the ratios
at low √sN N – as found earlier in Refs.
[7, 8] – while the inclusion of
CSR leads to results signiﬁcantly closer to the data. Especially, the rise of
the K +/π+ ratio at low invariant energy follows closely the experimental
excitation function when incorporating ’chiral symmetry restoration’.

4. Conclusions

When comparing the results from the extended PHSD approach for the
ratios K +/π+ and (Λ + Σ0)/π− from the diﬀerent scenarios we see in Fig. 1
that the results from PHSD fail to describe the data in the conventional sce-
nario [15] without incorporating the CSR. Especially, the rise of the K +/π+
ratio at low invariant energies follows closely the experimental excitation
function when including ’chiral symmetry restoration’ in the string decay.
Nevertheless, the drop in this ratio again is due to ’deconﬁnement’ since
there is no longer any hadronic string decay in a partonic medium at higher
energies. Accordingly, the experimental ’horn’ in the excitation function is
caused by chiral symmetry restoration but also deconﬁnement is essential
to observe a maximum in the K +/π+ ratio.
