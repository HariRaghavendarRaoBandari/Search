GLUING FORMULAS FOR THE L2-ALEXANDER TORSIONS

FATHI BEN ARIBI

Abstract. The L2-Alexander torsions of 3-manifolds were deﬁned in 2014 by
J. Dubois, S. Friedl and W. L¨uck, and generalize the L2-Alexander invariant
of a knot introduced by W. Li and W. Zhang in 2006. These torsions are
topological invariants that are classes of maps on the positive real numbers
and provide invariant of links up to ambient isotopy. They only exist when
technical conditions are satisﬁed, and they are hard to compute in general.
Despite these diﬃculties, we are able to extract important information from
these torsions, like the simplicial volume of the manifold or the Thurston norm
of a cohomology class.

In this article, we prove various gluing formulas satisﬁed by the L2-Alexander

torsions of 3-manifolds, in particular Dehn surgery formulas.

Furthermore, using various techniques, we compute explicitly the torsions
of exteriors of torus links in the 3-sphere and in the solid torus, which leads
us to prove general torsion formulas for connected sums and cablings of links.

1. Introduction

In 1935, Reidemeister introduced the Reidemeister torsions in order to classify
3-dimensional lens spaces. These topological invariants are deﬁned using standard
notions from linear algebra and combinatorial topology.

In 1962, Milnor observed that the Alexander polynomial of a link in S3 can be

interpreted as a particular Reidemeister torsion of the link exterior.

In 1976, Atiyah laid the foundations of the theory of L2-invariants. The idea is
roughly the following: algebraic topology has many invariants that involve ﬁnite
dimensional vector spaces and linear maps; by doing similar processes with inﬁnite
dimensional Hilbert spaces - like ℓ2(G) where G is a group - and operators on these
spaces, we obtain the so-called L2-invariants.

In the nineties, Carey-Mathai, Lott, L¨uck-Rothenberg, and Novikov-Shubin de-
veloped the theory of L2-torsions, that are L2-analogs of the classical Reidemeister
torsions.

In 2006, Li and Zhang introduced the L2-Alexander invariant, an analog of the
Alexander polynomial, and proved its relation with a certain L2-torsion of the knot
exterior, mirroring Milnor’s previous result.

Finally, in 2014, Dubois, Friedl and L¨uck generalized these invariants with the
L2-Alexander torsion associated to a triplet (M, φ, γ), where M is a compact 3-
manifold with empty or toroidal boundary, and φ : π1(M ) → Z and γ : π1(M ) → G
are group homomorphisms such that φ factors through γ.

One of the main results of this article is the gluing formula satisﬁed by the

L2-Alexander torsions, stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1. [Gluing formula] Let X, A, B, V be compact connected CW-complexes,
such that X = A ∪ B and V = A ∩ B and let πA
the group homomorphisms induced by the inclusions.

Let φ : πX −→ Z and γ : πX → G such that φ factors through γ. Let t > 0. If

the three N (G)-cellular chain complexes

C(2)

∗ (B, φ ◦ jB, γ ◦ jB, t)

∗ (V, φ ◦ i, γ ◦ i, t), C(2)

∗ (A, φ ◦ jA, γ ◦ jA, t), C(2)

are weakly acyclic and of determinant class, then C(2)
and of determinant class as well, and

∗ (X, φ, γ, t) is weakly acyclic

T (2)(X, φ, γ)(t) ˙=

T (2)(A, φ ◦ jA, γ ◦ jA)(t) · T (2)(B, φ ◦ jB, γ ◦ jB)(t)

T (2)(V, φ ◦ i, γ ◦ i)(t)

.

This theorem is proven using combinatorial arguments and the multiplicativity

formula for the L2-torsion of [11, Theorem 3.35 (1)].

As a consequence, we prove a general Dehn surgery formula, in the following

theorem.

Theorem 1.2. Let N be a 3-manifold obtained from M by a Dehn ﬁlling,
Q : π1(M ) → π1(N ) the associated group epimorphism and c the image in π1(N )
of the core of the ﬁlling solid torus.

Let φ : πN → Z and γ : πN → G be group homomorphisms such that φ factors
∗ (M, φ◦Q, γ◦Q)(t)
∗ (N, φ, γ)(t) is weakly acyclic

through γ. For all t > 0, if γ(c) is of inﬁnite order in G and if C(2)
is weakly acyclic and of determinant class, then C(2)
and of determinant class, and

T (2)(N, φ, γ)(t) ˙=

T (2)(M, φ ◦ Q, γ ◦ Q)(t)

max(1, t)|φ(c)|

.

An important consequence is an L2-analog of the classical Torres formula for the

Alexander polynomial (see Theorem 4.7).

We also apply these gluing formulas to the computation of the L2-Alexander
torsions for links whose exteriors are Seifert-ﬁbered manifolds. One such link L is
always either a torus link T (ep, eq), or of the form T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv or T (ep, eq) ∪
Hv ∪ Hh where Hv, Hh are great circles of S3. The following theorem summarizes
several formulas of this article.

Theorem 1.3.

• If L = T (ep, eq) with p, q coprime (and non zero when

e > 2), then

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne) ◦ αL, id)(t) ˙= max(1, t)(e|pq|−|p|−|q|)|n1+...+ne|.

• If L = T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv with p, q coprime and p 6= 0, then

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1) ◦ αL, id)(t) ˙= max(1, t)(e|p|−1)|q(n1+...+ne)+ne+1|.

• If L = T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh with p, q coprime, then

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1, ne+2) ◦ αL, id)(t)
˙= max(1, t)e|pq(n1+...+ne)+pne+1+qne+2|.

As a consequence, we prove general connected sum and cabling formulas for the
L2-Alexander torsions of links, that generalize the ones for knots established in [1].

Most of the results of this article come from the author’s PhD thesis [2].
The article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews some well-known facts
about knots, groups, and L2-invariants; Section 3 reviews three important basic
formulas satisﬁed by the L2-Alexander torsions, notably the gluing formula; Section
4 presents the various Dehn surgery formulas and their consequences; ﬁnally, Section
5 tackles the computation of the torsions of Seifert-ﬁbered link exteriors.

2. Definitions

Here we follow mostly [4]. We choose an orientation for the 3-sphere S3.
A knot in S3 is a (topological) embedding (i.e. an homeomorphism onto its

image) of a circle S1 into S3. All knots will be assumed oriented.

Two knots K : S1 ֒→ S3 and K ′ : S1 ֒→ S3 are ambient isotopic if there is an

orientation-preserving homeomorphism

H : S3 × [0; 1] → S3 × [0; 1]
(y, t) 7→ (ht(y), t)

such that h0 = IdS3 and h1 ◦ K = K ′. We call H an ambient isotopy connecting
K and K ′.

We will only consider tame knots, i.e. knots that are ambient isotopic to a

piece-wise linear embedding of S1 into S3.

A knot K will mean alternatively an embedding, a class of embeddings up to
ambient isotopy, the image of an embedding (which is a 1-dimensional sub-manifold
of S3) or the class of images of embeddings up to ambient isotopy.

Let K be an oriented knot in S3, and V (K) an open tubular neighbourhood of
K. The exterior of K is denoted MK = S3 \ V (K), it is a compact 3-manifold with
toroidal boundary. For V (K) thin enough, MK does not depend on the chosen
V (K). The orientation of MK comes from the one of S3, and does not depend on
the orientation of K. The boundary torus ∂MK is oriented with the convention
that vectors normal to the boundary point outside of MK.

Since K is oriented, there is, up to isotopy, a unique pair of simple closed curves
µK and λK on the 2-torus ∂MK = ∂V (K) such that µK bounds a disk in V (K) and
λK is homologous to K in V (K). We choose an orientation for these two curves
such that the linking number between µK and K and the intersection number
between µK and λK are both +1. The pair (µK, λK) is called a preferred meridian-
longitude pair for K. Any such µK is called a meridian curve. Here we have used
the notations and deﬁnitions of [17].

A link with c ∈ N components, or c- link, is an embedding of a disjoint union
i=1S1 into S3; we will assume that all links have ordered oriented
of c circles ⊔c
components. We consider links up to ambient isotopies in S3 that preserve the
order and the orientation of the components, unless precised otherwise. We only
consider tame links as well.

Any component Li of a link L can be seen as a knot in S3, and thus we can

choose a preferred meridian-longitude pair (µLi , λLi) for each Li.

A split link is a link L ⊂ S3 such that there exists a 2-sphere Σ ⊂ S3, L = L′ ⊔L′′
with L′ and L′′ sub-links, and L′ and L′′ are contained in diﬀerent connected
components of S3 \ Σ. Most of the time we will assume that links are non-split.

The group of a link L is the fundamental group of its exterior and is denoted
GL = π1(ML). We denote αL : GL ։ Zc the abelianization homomorphism, where
c is the number of components of L. The linking number between two components
Li, Lj of a link L is denoted lk(Li, Lj).

2.1. L2-invariants. Here we follow mostly [11]. Let G be a countable discrete
group. In the following, every algebra will be a C-algebra.

Consider the vector space C[G] =Lg∈G Cg (which is also an algebra) and its

scalar product:

The completion of C[G] is

the Hilbert space of square-summable complex functions on the group G.

We denote B(ℓ2(G)) the algebra of operators on ℓ2(G) that are continuous (or

equivalently, bounded) for the operator norm.

To any h ∈ G we associate a left-multiplication Lh : ℓ2(G) → ℓ2(G) deﬁned by

Both Lh and Rh are isometries, and therefore belong to B(ℓ2(G)).

We will use the same notation for right-multiplications by elements of the com-

plex group algebra C[G]:

:=

λigi

λiRgi ∈ B(ℓ2(G)).

RPk

i=1

kXi=1

We will also use this notation to deﬁne a right-multiplication by a matrix A with

coeﬃcients in C[G], p rows and q columns, in the following way:

If A = (ai,j)16i6p,16j6q ∈ Mp,q(C[G]), then

RA :=(cid:0)Rai,j(cid:1)16i6p,16j6q ∈ B(ℓ2(G)q; ℓ2(G)p).

Here ℓ2(G)p will denote the direct sum of p copies of ℓ2(G), endowed with a

natural Hilbert structure.

We write N (G) the algebraic commutant of {Lg; g ∈ G} in B(ℓ2(G)). It will be

called the von Neumann algebra of the group G.
Let us remark that Rg ∈ N (G) for all g in G.
The trace of an element φ of N (G) is deﬁned as

trN (G)(φ) := hφ(e), ei

where e is the neutral element of G. This induces a trace on the Mn,n(N (G)) for
n ≥ 1 by summing up the traces of the diagonal elements. We will write this new
trace trN (G) as well.

We will call a ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-module any Hilbert space V on
which there is a left G-action by isometries, and such that there exists a positive
i=1 ℓ2(G) (an embedding meaning
here a linear isometrical injective G-equivariant map, where the left G-action on

integer m and an embedding φ of V into Lm
Lm

i=1 ℓ2(G) is by left-multiplication coordinate by coordinate).

The von Neumann dimension of such a ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-module

V is deﬁned as the trace of the projection:

dimN (G)(V ) := trN (G)(prφ(V )) ∈ R>0,

where

prφ(V ) :

kMi=1

ℓ2(G) →

ℓ2(G)

kMi=1

is the orthogonal projection onto φ(V ). The von Neumann dimension does not
depend on the embedding of V into the ﬁnite direct sum of copies of ℓ2(G).

For U and V two ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-modules, we will call f : U → V
a morphism of ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-modules if f is a linear G-equivariant
map, bounded for the respective scalar products of U and V .

2.2. The Fuglede-Kadison determinant. Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group
and U, V be two ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-modules. Let f : U → V be a
morphism of ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-modules. The spectral density of f is
the map λ ∈ R>0 7→ F (f )(λ) deﬁned by:

F (f )(λ) := sup{dimN (G)(L)|L ∈ L(f, λ)}

where L(f, λ) is the set of ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-sub-modules of U on
which the restriction of f has an operator norm smaller than or equal to λ.

Let us remark that F (f )(λ) is monotonous and right-continuous, and thus de-
ﬁnes a measure dF (f ) on the Borel set of R>0 solely determined by the equation
dF (f )(]a, b]) = F (f )(b) − F (f )(a) for all a < b.

Remark 2.1. For all λ, F (f )(λ) = F (f ∗f )(λ2) = F (|f |)(λ) where f ∗f : U → U is a
positive operator and |f | is its square root.

We can thus think with positive operators and observe that dF (f ) measures
If λ is atomic then dF (f )(λ) is the von Neumann

the “density of eigenvalues”.
dimension of the eigenspace associated to λ.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The Fuglede-Kadison determinant of f is deﬁned by:

detN (G)(f ) := exp(cid:18)Z ∞

ln(λ) dF (f )(λ)(cid:19)

ifR ∞
WhenR ∞

0+ ln(λ) dF (f )(λ) > −∞ ; if not, detN (G)(f ) = 0.

0+ ln(λ) dF (f )(λ) > −∞, we say that f is of determinant class.

Here are several properties of the determinant we will use in the rest of this

paper (see [11] for more details and proofs).

Proposition 2.3. (1) detN (G)(0 : U → V ) = 1.

(2) For every nonzero complex number λ, detN (G)(λIdU ) = |λ|dimN (G)(U).
(3) For all f, g morphisms of ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-modules,

detN (G)(cid:18)(cid:18)f

g(cid:19)(cid:19) = detN (G)(f ) · detN (G)(g).

(4) Let f : U → V and g : V → W be morphisms of ﬁnitely generated Hilbert

N (G)-modules. Assume that f has dense image and g is injective. Then

detN (G)(g ◦ f ) = detN (G)(g) · detN (G)(f ).

(5) Let f1 : U1 → V1, f2 : U2 → V2, f3 : U2 → V1 be morphisms of ﬁnitely

generated Hilbert N (G)-modules. If f1 has dense image and f2 is injective, then

detN (G)(cid:18)(cid:18)f1

0

f3

f2(cid:19)(cid:19) = detN (G)(f1) · detN (G)(f2).

(6) Let f be a morphism of ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-modules. Then

detN (G)(f ) = detN (G)(f ∗) =qdetN (G)(f ∗f ) =qdetN (G)(f f ∗).

Remark 2.4. If f : U → V is a morphism between two ﬁnitely generated Hilbert
N (G)-modules U, V that have the same von Neumann dimension, then f is injective
if and only if f has dense image, by [11, Lemma 1.13].

Therefore, when dealing with “square” operators, the property “has dense image”
can be replaced by “is injective” in the assumptions of Proposition 2.3 (4) and (5).

Proposition 2.5. Let g ∈ G be of inﬁnite order, let t ∈ C, then Id−tRg is injective
and

detN (G)(Id − tRg) = max(1, |t|).

The proof of this proposition can be found in [12, Proposition 3.2, Remark 3.3].
The value of the determinant can also be computed as a direct consequence of [11,
Example 3.22].

Remark 2.6. Note that for t > 0 and any integer k, max(1, tk) = t
This shall be used often and implicitly in the following proofs.

k−|k|

2 max(1, t)|k|.

2.3. L2-torsion. We follow [11] and [7].

A ﬁnite Hilbert N (G)-chain complex C∗ is a sequence of morphisms of ﬁnitely

generated Hilbert N (G)-modules

C∗ = 0 → Cn

∂n−→ Cn−1

∂n−1−→ . . .

∂2−→ C1

∂1−→ C0 → 0

such that ∂p ◦ ∂p+1 = 0 for all p.

The p-th L2-homology of C∗
H (2)

p (C∗) := Ker(∂p)/Im(∂p+1)

is a ﬁnitely generated Hilbert N (G)-module. Its von Neumann dimension

b(2)
p (C∗) := dimN (G)(H (2)

p (C∗))

is called the p-th Betti number of C∗.

We say that C∗ is weakly acyclic if its L2-homology is trivial, i.e.

if all its L2-
Betti numbers vanish. We say that C∗ is of determinant class if all the operators
∂p are of determinant class.

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let C∗ be a ﬁnite Hilbert N (G)-chain complex as above. If C∗ is
weakly acyclic and of determinant class, deﬁne its L2-torsion by

T (2)(C∗) :=

nYi=1

det N (G)(∂i)(−1)i

∈ R>0.

Note that in [11, Deﬁnition 3.29] weak acyclicity is not assumed, it is in fact
not necessary to deﬁne T (2)(C∗). However we will often require the weak acyclicity
assumption in the various formulas of this paper, that is why we chose to assume
it in the deﬁnition.

The following proposition will be useful for computations of L2-torsions. Com-

pare with [2, Proposition 1.58] and [7, Lemma 3.1].

Proposition 2.8. Let

C∗ = 0 → ℓ2(G)k ∂2−→ ℓ2(G)k+l ∂1−→ ℓ2(G)l → 0

be a 2-dimensional ﬁnite Hilbert N (G)-chain complex and let J ⊂ {1, . . . , k + l} be
a subset of {1, . . . , k + l} of size l.

For i = 1, 2, ∂i is naturally written as a matrix with coeﬃcients operators in
B(ℓ2(G)). We write ∂1(J) : ℓ2(G)l → ℓ2(G)l the operator composed of the columns
of ∂1 indexed by J, and ∂2(J) : ℓ2(G)k → ℓ2(G)k the operator obtained from ∂2 by
deleting the rows indexed by J.

If ∂2(J) and ∂1(J) are injective and of determinant class, then C∗ is weakly

acyclic and of determinant class, and

T (2)(C∗) =

detN (G)(∂2)
detN (G)(∂1)

=

detN (G)(∂2(J))
detN (G)(∂1(J))

.

There exists an immediate generalisation of Proposition 2.8 to any dimension

that mirrors the formula of [15, Theorem 2.2].

2.4. L2-Alexander torsion. We follow the deﬁnitions and notations of [7].

Let π be a group, φ : π → Z a homomorphism, and γ : π → G an homomorphism.
We say that (π, φ, γ) forms an admissible triple if φ : π → Z factors through γ (i.e.
there is a group homomorphism ψ : G → Z such that φ = ψ ◦ γ).

multiplication by the (t 7→ tm), m ∈ Z, which does not depend on the CW-structure
chosen on X (the technical details can be found in [2]). For two maps f, g : R>0 →

torically, L2-torsions came before L2-Alexander torsions; see [11, Section 3.4] for

Proposition 2.10. [11, Theorem 1.35 (2)] Let X be a ﬁnite CW-complex. We have

χ(X) =Xp

p (X).

Remark 2.11. Since we need C(2)
∗ (X, φ, γ, t) to be weakly acyclic to compute the L2-
Alexander torsion of (X, φ, γ), it is necessary that χ(X) = 0. Indeed, if χ(X) 6= 0,
then the von Neumann dimensions of the modules C(2)
p (X, φ, γ, t), i.e. the number
of cells of X of each dimension, do not give a zero alternating sum (by Propo-
sition 2.10), thus C(2)
∗ (X, φ, γ, t) cannot possibly be weakly acyclic. Like Reide-
meister torsion, the L2-Alexander torsion is an invariant we turn to only when the
Euler characteristic vanishes, and more precisely when all L2-Betti numbers (of
C(2)

∗ (X, φ, γ, t)) vanish.

characteristic, like a ﬁnite union of tori.

This is the case we consider in this article: we study L2-Alexander torsions for 3-
manifolds M only when M is closed or compact with toroidal boundary. Moreover,
we ask that M is irreducible, i.e. every embedded 2-sphere bounds an embedded
3-ball in M .

The following astonishing theorem of W. L¨uck and T. Schick (see [10]) states that
the L2-torsion of an irreducible 3-manifold gives precisely the simplicial volume
of this manifold. Recall that a compact connected orientable 3-manifold M is
called hyperbolic if its interior admits a complete Riemannian metric whose sectional
curvature is constant equal to −1, and Seifert if it admits a foliation by circles.

Theorem 2.12 ([11], Theorem 4.3). Let M be a compact connected orientable
irreducible 3-manifold with inﬁnite fundamental group and empty or incompressible
toroidal boundary.

According to the JSJ-decomposition, M splits along disjoint incompressible tori
into pieces that are Seifert manifolds or hyperbolic manifolds. The hyperbolic pieces
M1, . . . , Mh have all ﬁnite hyperbolic volume volhyp.

Then C(2)

∗ (M, 0, id, 1) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class, and

T (2)(M ) = exp(cid:18) vol(M )

i=1 volhyp(Mi) is the simplicial volume of M .

3. First formulas

3.1. Simple homotopy equivalence. The following theorem states that the L2-
Alexander torsions are invariant by simple homotopy equivalence. Note that this
result is a direct generalization of the formulas of [15, Corollary 9.2] and [11, The-
orem 3.96 (1)], and was announced in [7]. The technical details of the proof can be
found in [2, Theorem 2.12].

Theorem 3.1 ([2], Theorem 2.12). Let f : X → Y be a simple homotopy equiva-
lence between two ﬁnite CW-complexes inducing the group isomorphism f∗ : π1(X) →
π1(Y ). The triple (Y, φ, γ) is an admissible triple if and only if (X, φ ◦ f∗, γ ◦ f∗) is

of determinant class if and only if C(2)

∗ (X, φ ◦ f∗, γ ◦ f∗, t) is weakly acyclic and

∗ (Y, φ, γ, t) is, and in this case one has

T (2)(X, φ ◦ f∗, γ ◦ f∗)(t) ˙= T (2)(Y, φ, γ)(t).

If N is a compact smooth 3-manifold, then it follow from theorems due to Chap-
man and Cohen (see [5] and [6]) that any two CW-structures on N are simple
homotopy equivalent. Theorem 3.1 thus implies that for any admissible triple
(π1(N ), φ, γ), T (2)(N, φ, γ) is a well-deﬁned topological invariant of the manifold
N .

3.2. CW-complexes of the form W × S1. Let W be a ﬁnite CW-complex, S1
the one-dimensional circle with its classical CW-complex structure (one 0-cell and
one 1-cell). Let X = W × S1 be the product space , whose CW-structure is induced
by the direct product.

We prove how to relate the L2-Alexander torsions of X to those of W , as a
generalisation of [11, Theorem 3.93 (4)]. Let πW = π1(W ), T a ﬁxed generator of
π1(S1) ∼= Z and πX = π1(X) ∼= πW × Z. We consider the natural inclusion S1 ֒→
S1 × {pW } ⊂ X (where pW is the chosen basepoint on W ) and i : π1(S1) → πX the
induced group homomorphism.

Proposition 3.2. Let φ : πX −→ Z and γ : πX → G such that (πX , φ, γ) is an
admissible triple. Let t > 0. If (γ◦i)(T ) has inﬁnite order in G, then C(2)
∗ (X, φ, γ, t)
is weakly acyclic and of determinant class, and

T (2)(X, φ, γ)(t) ˙= max(1, t)−χ(W )|(φ◦i)(T )|.

Proof. Let n be the dimension of the CW-complex W , and ck the number of k-cells
of W of dimension k, for 0 6 k 6 n. One has immediately

4. Dehn surgery formulas

We are going to apply the gluing formula of Theorem 3.3 to the case of Dehn
surgery, where we glue a solid torus on a toroidal boundary component of a 3-
manifold. First we recall the deﬁnition of Dehn surgery.

4.1. Dehn Surgery. We follow [14, Section 9F].

Let M be a 3-manifold and let T1, . . . , Tn be 2-tori that are connected components

of ∂M . For each i = 1, . . . , n, specify a simple closed curve Ji on each Ti. Let

M ′ = M ∪h(cid:0)(S1 × D2) ⊔ . . . ⊔ (S1 × D2)(cid:1)

where h is an union of homeomorphisms hi : S1 × S1 → Ti, each of which take a
meridian curve mi of ∂(S1 × D2) to the curve Ji.

Up to homeomorphism M ′ does not depend on the choice of h. We say that M ′

is obtained by Dehn Filling on M .

Dehn surgery refers to the more general process of drilling out links in M and
then ﬁlling them along certain curves. We will mostly be interested in the Dehn
ﬁlling process.

When M is the exterior of an oriented link L = L1 ∪ . . . ∪ . . . Ln ∪ Ln+1 ∪ . . . ∪ Lc
in S3 and Ti = ∂V (Li) for i = 1, . . . , n, each Li has a preferred meridian-longitude
pair (µi, λi). We only need to specify the homotopy class of Ji in Ti, described by
two relatively prime integers pi, qi:

[Ji] = pi[µi] + qi[λi].

We call pi/qi ∈ Q ∪ {∞} the surgery coeﬃcient associated with the component Li.
Example 4.1. A p/q-surgery on the trivial knot yields the lens space L(p, q).

In particular, a 0-surgery on the trivial knot yields S2 × S1, and a ±1/n-surgery,

n ∈ N on the trivial knot yields S3.

A ∞-surgery on any knot yields S3 (this corresponds to the trivial ﬁlling of the

knotted tunnel).
4.2. L2-Alexander torsions of the torus and the solid torus. As conse-
quences of Proposition 3.2 we compute the L2-Alexander torsions of the circle,
the solid torus and the 2-torus.
Corollary 4.2. For c a generator of π1(S1), if γ(c) is of inﬁnite order in G,
then C(2)
∗ (S1, φ, γ)(t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class for all t, and its
L2-Alexander torsion is

T (2)(S1, φ, γ)(t) ˙=

1

max(1, t)|φ(c)| .

Corollary 4.3. For c a generator of π1(S1 × D2), if γ(c) is of inﬁnite order in G,
then C(2)
∗ (S1 × D2, φ, γ)(t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class for all t, and
its L2-Alexander torsion is

T (2)(S1 × D2, φ, γ)(t) ˙=

1

max(1, t)|φ(c)| .

Corollary 4.4. If γ(π1(S1 × S1)) is inﬁnite, then C(2)
acyclic and of determinant class, and its L2-Alexander torsion is

∗ (S1 × S1, φ, γ)(t) is weakly

T (2)(S1 × S1, φ, γ)(t) ˙= 1.

Proof. Let X = S1 × S1 be the 2-torus; π1(X) ∼= Z2 admits a presentation of the
form hT, S|T S = ST i. Since γ(π1(X)) is inﬁnite, then at least one of T, S has an
image by γ of inﬁnite order in G, for instance T . Then X is homeomorphic to
S1 × W where W is the circle corresponding to S. Proposition 3.2 concludes the
proof.

4.3. The Dehn Surgery formula. Let M be a compact connected 3-manifold
with non-empty toroidal boundary, B a solid torus, T a boundary part of M , and
J a simple closed curve on T . Let N be the manifold obtained by doing a Dehn
ﬁlling on M for the curve J on the boundary part T .

One has N = M ∪ B and T = M ∩ B. Let J ′ be a simple closed curve on T such
that the classes of J and J ′ form a system of generators of π1(T ) ∼= Z2. We can
assume that J and J ′ intersect on a single point P , which will be the base point
for all the following fundamental groups.

We choose a CW-structure on M and T such that P is a 0-cell and J and J ′ are
1-cells. For constructing the CW-structure of B we choose a 2-cell D bounded by
J, and a 3-cell ρ glued in the usual way to close the solid torus. Thus J ′ and the
core of B have the same homotopy class in π1(B). We can thus see J as a meridian
of B and J ′ as a longitude of B. Finally we give N the CW-structure composed of
those of M, T and B.

Let πM = π1(M ), πN = π1 (N ) and c the homotopy class of the core of B in
π1(B). Then the inclusion JM : M ⊂ N induces a quotient group homomorphism
Q : π ։ πN (whose kernel is normally generated by [J]), and the inclusion JB :
B ⊂ N induces a group homomorphism ι : cZ → πN . The following diagram should
make everything clearer.

Theorem 4.5 ([2], Theorem 3.6). Let φ : πN → Z and γ : πN → G be group
homomorphisms such that (πN , φ, γ) forms an admissible triple. For all t > 0,
if γ(ι(c)) is of inﬁnite order in G and if C(2)
∗ (M, φ ◦ Q, γ ◦ Q)(t) is weakly acyclic
and of determinant class, then C(2)
∗ (N, φ, γ)(t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant
class, and

T (2)(N, φ, γ)(t) ˙=

T (2)(M, φ ◦ Q, γ ◦ Q)(t)

.

Proof. Since γ(ι(c)) is of inﬁnite order in G, C(2)

T (2)(B, φ ◦ ι, γ ◦ ι)(t) ˙=

max(1, t)|φ(ι(c))| .

Likewise, γ(i(π1(T ))) = γ(ι(π1(B))) is an inﬁnite subgroup of G, thus, by Corol-

∗ (T, φ ◦ i, γ ◦ i, t) is weakly acylic and of determinant class, and

T (2)(T, φ ◦ i, γ ◦ i)(t) = 1.

Let M be the exterior of an oriented link L = L1 ∪. . .∪Lc in S3 and T = ∂V (Lc).
Let (µ, λ) be a preferred meridian-longitude pair for T . We describe a simple closed
curve J on T by its homotopy class, which is characterised by two relatively prime
integers p, q:

[J] = p[µ] + q[λ]
Let r, s ∈ Z be relatively prime integers such that

and let J ′ be a curve in T such that

r

det(cid:18)(cid:18)p q

s(cid:19)(cid:19) = 1

[J ′] = r[µ] + s[λ].

We can assume that J and J ′ intersect on a single point P .

Let N denote the manifold obtained by Dehn ﬁlling on Lc with coeﬃcient p/q,
and B the ﬁlling solid torus. Then Q : π1(M ) ։ π1(N ) is the quotient group
homomorphism that adds the relation [µ]p[λ]q = 1. We have trivialised the curve
[J].

Theorem 4.5 can thus be re-written as:

Theorem 4.6 ([2], Theorem 3.7). Let φ : πN → Z and γ : πN → G be group
homomorphisms such that (πN , φ, γ) forms an admissible triple. For all t > 0, if
(γ ◦ Q)([µ]r[λ]s) is of inﬁnite order in G and if C(2)
∗ (M, φ ◦ Q, γ ◦ Q)(t) is weakly
acyclic and of determinant class, then C(2)
∗ (N, φ, γ)(t) is weakly acyclic and of
determinant class, and

T (2)(N, φ, γ)(t) ˙=

T (2)(M, φ ◦ Q, γ ◦ Q)(t)

max(1, t)|r(φ◦Q)([µ])+s(φ◦Q)([λ])| .

Let us now study some applications of this Dehn surgery formula.

4.4. ∞-surgery: erasing one component of a link. Let L = L1 ∪. . .∪Lc−1 ∪Lc
a c-component link, and L′ = L1 ∪. . .∪Lc−1 the link obtained by forgetting the last
component, or alternatively by applying a trivial Dehn ﬁlling of the last component.
Then the natural injection i : ML ֒→ ML′ passes to fundamental groups as a
surjective homomorphism Q = i∗ : GL ։ GL′, which is the same as the quotient
homomorphism by the normal subgroup generated by any meridian of Lc. Let
(µc, λc) be a preferred meridian-longitude system of Lc.

Here the surgery coeﬃcients are p = 1, q = 0, r = 0, s = 1.
Note that if L is brunnian, then L′ is trivial split. We need to assume that

neither L nor L′ is split, or equivalently that ML and ML′ are both irreducible.

Theorem 4.7. Let φ : π1(ML′) → Z and γ : π1(ML′) → G be group homomor-
phisms such that (π1(ML′), φ, γ) forms an admissible triple.

We can write φ = (n1, . . . , nc−1) ◦ αL′ and thus φ ◦ Q = (n1, . . . , nc−1, 0) ◦ αL for

some non zero vector (n1, . . . , nc−1) ∈ Zc−1.

For all t > 0, if (γ ◦ Q)([λ]) is of inﬁnite order in G and if
∗ (ML, (n1, . . . , nc−1, 0) ◦ αL, γ ◦ Q)(t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class,
∗ (ML′, (n1, . . . , nc−1)◦αL′, γ)(t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class,

C(2)
then C(2)
and

T (2)(ML′, (n1, . . . , nc−1) ◦ αL′ , γ)(t) ˙=

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , nc−1, 0) ◦ αL, γ ◦ Q)
max(1, t)|lk(L1,Lc)n1+...+lk(Lc−1,Lc)nc−1| .
This theorem generalises the well-known property of the Alexander polynomial

for links proved by Torres in [16].

GLUING FORMULAS FOR THE L2-ALEXANDER TORSIONS

Proof. We apply Theorem 4.6 and we use the fact that here

r(φ ◦ Q)([µ]) + s(φ ◦ Q)([λ]) = (φ ◦ Q)([λc])

= (n1, . . . , nc−1, 0) ◦ αL([λc])
= lk(L1, Lc)n1 + . . . + lk(Lc−1, Lc)nc−1.

4.5. 1/n-surgery: Twist knots and the Whitehead link. Let L be the White-
head link in S3, and ML its exterior. We draw it as in Figure 1 with components
L1 and L2. Note that L is actually ambient isotopic to the link obtained by re-
ordering the components, therefore doing a given surgery on L1 or L2 yields the
same manifold up to homeomorphism. We will do a 1/n-surgery on the component
L2.

The following theorem relates a particular L2-Alexander torsion of the White-
head link, where φ sends the second component to zero and γ is an epimorphism to
a knot group, to the L2-Alexander torsion of this knot group. The possible knots
in question are the twist knots Kn, described by the diagram of Figure 2.

K1 = 31 is the trefoil knot, K−1 = 41 is the ﬁgure-eight knot, K2 = 52, K−2 = 61,
etc.

Let (α, β) be a preferred meridian-longitude system for L2 as in Figure 1.

16

FATHI BEN ARIBI

Here we do 1/n-surgery on L2, which means that (p, q) = (1, n), and thus (r, s) =
(0, 1) is a possible choice of coeﬃcients for the curve J ′, which means we can assume
J ′ = β.

Let N be the manifold obtained by this surgery on ML. Let JM : ML ֒→ N be
the associated natural inclusion, which extends to an inclusion S3 \ V (L2) ֒→ S3
since 1/n-surgery on the trivial knot in S3 yields S3. The image of L1 by this
inclusion is Kn, as Figures 1 and 2 illustrate. Thus N = MKn = S3 \ V (Kn). The
inclusion JM induces an epimorphism Qn : π1(ML) ։ π1(MKn) whose kernel is
the normal subgroup generated by [J] = [α][β]n.

∗ (MKn , αKn , γ)(t) is

T (2)(MKn , αKn, γ)(t) ˙= T (2)(ML, (1, 0) ◦ αL, γ ◦ Qn)(t).

Proof. We apply Theorem 4.6. Here (γ ◦ Qn)([α]r[β]s) = (γ ◦ Qn)([β]) = γ(m).

Since (αKn ◦ Qn)([β]) = (1, 0) · αL([β]) = (1, 0) ·(cid:18)0

0(cid:19) = 0, we conclude that the

denominator part is equal to max(1, t)(αKn ◦Qn)([β]) = 1. The theorem follows.

Remark 4.9. Results of Thurston and Jorgensen demonstrate that if one does p/q-
Dehn ﬁlling on a hyperbolic link complement, with p2+q2 large enough the resulting
manifold will also be hyperbolic with volume approaching the volume of the original
link complement by smaller values as p2 + q2 → ∞.

In particular, as n → ∞, by Theorem 4.8,

5. Seifert-fibered link exteriors

In this section we compute the L2-Alexander torsions for all link exteriors that
are Seifert-ﬁbered, like exteriors of torus links. As a consquence of the gluing
formula of Theorem 3.3, we also establish a formula for the L2-Alexander torsions
of 3-manifolds that are obtained as gluings of simpler manifolds along tori; often this
tori are incompressible and correspond to the JSJ decomposition of the 3-manifold.
These various computations allow us to determine the L2-Alexander torsions of
a connected sum of links and of a general multi-component cabling of a link by a
torus link.

The following result ﬁrst appeared in [7, Theorem 5.5]. We will illustrate how it

can be seen as a consequence of Theorem 3.3.

Proposition 5.1 (Gluing along tori). Let N be a 3-manifold and
φ ∈ Hom(π1(N ); Z).

Let T1, . . . , Tk be disjoint tori in M and N1, . . . , Nl the connected components of

M minus small tubular open neighbourhoods of the tori Ti.

For i = 1, . . . , l, we denote by ιi : Ni → N and τj : Tj → N the inclusions.
Let γ : π1(N ) → G be a homomorphism such that (π1(N ), φ, γ) is an admissible

triple and the restriction γ ◦ (τj)∗ to each π1(Tj) has inﬁnite image. Let t > 0.

If C(2)

∗ (Ni, φ ◦ (ιi)∗, γ ◦ (ιi)∗, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class for all

Ni, then C(2)

∗ (N, φ, γ, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class and

T (2)(N, φ, γ)(t) ˙=

T (2)(Ni, φ ◦ (ιi)∗, γ ◦ (ιi)∗).

lYi=1

Proof. Let us ﬁrst assume that k = 1 and l = 2. We apply Theorem 3.3 with
A = N1, B = N2, V = T1, X = N . If we assume that (γ ◦ (τ1)∗)(π1(T1)) is inﬁnite,
then by Theorem 4.4, C(2)
∗ (T1, φ◦ (τ1)∗, γ ◦ (τ1)∗, t) is weakly acyclic, of determinant
class, and of L2-torsion equal to 1.
Besides, we assumed that C(2)

∗ (Ni, φ ◦ (ιi)∗, γ ◦ (ιi)∗, t) is weakly acyclic and of

determinant class for i = 1, 2. The ﬁrst part of the theorem follows.

For bigger k and l one just applies the previous reasoning by induction on k, tori
by tori. Note that rigorously speaking, the base points of the fundamental groups
change at each step but this does not change the ﬁnal formula.

Corollary 5.2 (JSJ decomposition formula). With the same notations as Proposi-
tion 5.1, assume also that N is irreducible, the T1, . . . , Tk are the collection of JSJ
tori and the N1, . . . , Nl are the JSJ pieces. Then the homomorphisms (ιi)∗ and the
(τj)∗ are injective and

T (2)(N, φ, id)(t) ˙=

lYi=1

T (2)(Ni, φ ◦ (ιi)∗, id).

For details we refer to [2, Proposition 4.1].
These formulas are a great help for computing the L2-Alexander torsions of
an irreducible 3-manifold, assuming we know the L2-Alexander torsions of its JSJ
pieces. When such a piece M is Seifert-ﬁbered, we can use the following Proposition
5.3 to compute its L2-Alexander torsions, which depend only on the Thurston norm
xM (φ) of the homomorphism φ. Recall that

xM (φ) = min

Σ ( kXi=1

max(−χ(Σi), 0))

18

FATHI BEN ARIBI

where Σ = Σ1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ Σk is a surface (properly embedded in M ) dual to φ (meaning
that the homology class [Σ] ∈ H2(M, ∂M ) is the Poincar´e dual of φ ∈ H 1(M )).

Proposition 5.3. ([7, Theorem 8.5]) Let (M, φ, γ : π1(M ) → G) be an admissible
triple with M a Seifert-ﬁbered 3-manifold not equal to S1 × S2 nor the solid torus
S1 × D2, and such that the image of any regular ﬁber under γ is an element of
inﬁnite order in G. Then for all t > 0, C(2)
∗ (M, φ, γ, t) is weakly acyclic and of
determinant class, and

T (2)(M, φ, γ) ˙= max(1, t)|xM (φ)|.

Remark 5.4. One can see Proposition 5.3 as a consequence of Proposition 3.2 and
Theorem 4.5, since a Seifert-ﬁbered 3-manifold can be seen as a Dehn ﬁlling on a
W × S1 with W a punctured disk (see for example [3, Section 3]).

As an immediate consequence of the two previous propositions, we can compute

the L2-Alexander torsions of graph manifolds.

Proposition 5.5. ([7, Theorem 8.6]) Let (N, φ, γ : π1(N ) → G) be an admissible
triple with N a graph manifold not equal to S1 × S2 nor the solid torus S1 × D2,
and such that given any JSJ component Ni of N , with ιi : Ni ֒→ N , the image of
any regular ﬁber of Ni under γ ◦ (ιi)∗ : π1(Ni) → G is an element of inﬁnite order
in G. Then for all t > 0, C(2)
∗ (N, φ, γ, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class,
and

T (2)(N, φ, γ) ˙= max(1, t)|xN (φ)| = max(1, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)Pl

xNi (φ◦(ιi)∗)(cid:12)(cid:12).

Computing Thurston norms is a diﬃcult problem in general. However, in this
section, we will compute the exact values of the L2-Alexander torsions for all Seifert-
ﬁbered link exteriors, and thus the values of their associated Thurston norms. This
will allow us to prove formulas for connected sums and cablings of links, which will
generalise the ones for knots of [1, Theorem 3.2] and [1, Theorem 4.3].

We hope that these various formulas will provide help to compute particular

Thurston norms for link exteriors.

Remark 5.6. In the remainder of this section, we will only look at gluings of link
exteriors along a toroidal boundary with a slope zero, in the sense that a preferred
meridian of a component of the ﬁrst link will be glued with a preferred longitude
of a component of the second link, and vice-versa. This is the case for connected
sums of links, satellite operations like cabling, and also ∞-surgery (removing one
component of the link).

However, Proposition 5.1 allows us to compute L2-Alexander torsions of man-
ifolds obtained by toroidal gluings of any slope p/q. Changing the slopes pj/qj
changes the inclusions Ni ֒→ N and thus changes φ ◦ (ιi)∗ and γ ◦ (ιi)∗. The
surgery formulas of the previous section can be seen as a particular example of this,
where a solid torus (i.e. the exterior of a trivial knot) is glued to a 3-manifold.

5.1. Links with Seifert-ﬁbered exterior. Let us consider S3 both as the unit
sphere of C2 and as the one-point compactiﬁcation of R3 by the point ∞. We deﬁne
2 } the torus link of type (m, n) with
e = gcd(m, n) components (which can be drawn on a torus as m strands
twisted n times by an angle 2π/m),

• T (m, n) = {(z1, z2) ∈ S3 ⊂ C2|zm

1 = zn

• Hv = {(z1, 0) ∈ S3} the trivial knot drawn as the vertical line passing

through ∞ in R3,

• Hh = {(0, z2) ∈ S3} the trivial knot drawn in R3 as the unit circle of an

horizontal plane (normal to Hv in its origin).

This allows us to describe the links L in S3 whose exterior is a Seifert manifold:

GLUING FORMULAS FOR THE L2-ALEXANDER TORSIONS

Proposition 5.7. (see [3, Proposition 3.3])

Let L be a non-split link in S3. Its exterior ML is Seifert-ﬁbered if and only if

L is one of the following links:

• a torus link T (m, n) = T (ep, eq) with p, q relatively prime (and both nonzero

if e > 2),

• a link T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv with p, q relatively prime and p 6= 0,
• a link T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh with p, q relatively prime.

We exclude the torus links of the form T (m, 0) with |m| > 2 since they are split.
We want to compute the L2-Alexander torsions of all links listed in Proposition
5.7. We will need various tools for this: gluing formulas, explicit homeomorphisms
between link exteriors, ∞-surgery, etc. For the reader’s convenience we outline the
several steps of our strategy:

(1) We compute the torsions for the keychain links T (e, 0)∪Hv with Proposition

3.2.

(2) We deduce the torsions for a connected sum of links thanks to the gluing

formula of Theorem 3.3.

(3) We compute the torsions for the links T (e, ek) ∪ Hv by identifying their

exterior with the exterior of the keychain link T (e, 0) ∪ Hv.

(4) We compute the torsions for the links T (p, q) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh with the gluing

formula.

(5) We deduce the torsions for the links T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh thanks to the

gluing formula.

(6) We apply two successive ∞-surgeries and deduce the torsions for the links

T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv and T (ep, eq).

(7) We deduce general cabling formulas for links, thanks to the gluing formula.

Remark 5.8. Most of the following results can also be proven with Fox calculus on
particular presentations of the link groups. Details can be found in [2].

5.2. Keychain links. Let e > 1. Let L be the (e + 1)-component link KCe+1 =
T (e, 0) ∪ Hv. We call it the (e + 1)-keychain link, see Figure 3. Let us call L1, . . . Le
the e parallel components of T (e, 0) and Le+1 = Hv the one that circles them all.
The link exterior ML is homeomorphic to S1 × W where W is a disc with e

punctures. Thus the link group GL = π1(ML) is isomorphic to F[g1, . . . ge] × Z.

The abelianisation αL : GL → Ze+1 sends ai, the meridian of Li, to the i-th

vector of the natural base of Ze+1.

Theorem 5.9. Let e > 1. The L2-Alexander torsion for the exterior of the
(e + 1)-component keychain link L exists for all admissible triples of the form
(GL, (n1, . . . , ne+1) ◦ αL, γ) such that γ(ae+1) has inﬁnite order in G and for all
t > 0. One has:

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne+1) ◦ αL, γ)(t) ˙= max(1, t)(e−1)|ne+1|.

Proof. We apply Proposition 3.2 with W a disc with e punctures.

5.3. Connected sum for links. Let L = L1 ∪ . . . ∪ Lc+1 and L′ = L′
d+1
be two non-split links in S3 such that L ∪ L′ is split. Let L′′ be the (c + d + 1)-
component link obtained by deleting small parts of Lc+1 and of L′
d+1 and then
connecting them to form a single component denoted Lc+1♯L′
d+1 (in a way that
d+1). The link L′′ is the connected sum
respects the orientations of Lc+1 and of L′
of L and L′ along the components Lc+1 and L′
d+1, and we order its components in
the following way:

1 ∪ . . . ∪ L′

L′′ = L′′

1 ∪ . . . ∪ L′′

c ∪ L′′
= L1 ∪ . . . ∪ Lc ∪ L′

c+1 ∪ . . . ∪ L′′
1 ∪ . . . ∪ L′

c+d ∪ L′′
d ∪ (Lc+1♯L′

c+d+1
d+1).

The manifold ML′′ is the toroidal gluing of ML, ML′ and a 3-component keychain
d+1 is glued
c+d+1. For details

link KC = T (2, 0) ∪ Hv = K1 ∪ K2 ∪ K3, where Lc+1 is glued with K1, L′
with K2, and the boundary of K3 becomes the boundary of L′′
and examples we refer to [3].

Let n1, . . . , nc+d+1 ∈ Z and let γ : GL′′ → G such that

(GL′′ , (n1, . . . , nc+d+1) ◦ αL′′, γ) is an admissible triple. Let t > 0.

Let J : ML ֒→ ML′′ and J ′ : ML′ ֒→ ML′′ denote the inclusions associated with
the toroidal gluing and j, j′ the induced injective group homomorphisms on the
fundamental groups (see the following diagram for clarity).

and that

(n1, . . . , nc+d+1) ◦ αL′′ ◦ j′ = (nc+1, . . . , nc+d, nc+d+1) ◦ αL′

by checking these identities on each of the meridian curves of L′′.

and

T = T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , nc, nc+d+1) ◦ αL, γ ◦ j)(t)

T ′ = T (2)(ML′, (nc+1, . . . , nc+d, nc+d+1) ◦ αL′, γ ◦ j′)(t).

This theorem generalizes [1, Theorem 3.2] (where c = 0, d = 0, n1 = 1).

Proof. We use Proposition 5.1 and Theorem 5.9. Since we assume that γ(m′′
c+d+1) is
of inﬁnite order in G, it follows that the tori ∂(V (K1)) and ∂(V (K2)) have inﬁnite
image under γ, because their preferred longitudes are homotopic to a preferred
meridian of K3 which is sent to m′′
c+d+1. The formula follows then from Proposition
5.1 and Theorem 5.9.

L2-Alexander torsions of its exterior.

Let λ denote a meridian of Hv and µ a preferred longitude of Hv. Remark that
λ, µ are respectively a longitude and a meridian of the torus on which T (e, ek) is
drawn. Let bi denote the meridians of the components of T (e, ek), as in Figure 4.

Theorem 5.11. The L2-Alexander torsion for the exterior of the (e+1)-component
link L = T (e, ek) ∪ Hv exists for all admissible triples of the form
(GL, (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1) ◦ αL, γ) such that γ(λµk) has inﬁnite order in G and for all

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1) ◦ αL, γ)(t) ˙= max(1, t)(e−1)|ne+1+k(n1+...+ne)|.

Proof. Let KC = T (e, 0) ∪ H ′

v = K1 ∪ . . . ∪ Ke ∪ Ke+1 be the (e + 1)-component

Then the exteriors ML and MKC are homeomorphic, by a sequence of k twists

in the two ﬁgures in the following way:

Ze+1 αKC←− GKC

(0, . . . , 0, 1) ←− ae+1 ←→ λµk 7−→ (k, . . . , k, 1)

Thus, for all integers n1, . . . , ne, ne+1,

(n1, . . . , ne, ne+1) ◦ αL ◦ ψ = (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1 + kn1 + . . . + kne) ◦ αKC .

Let φ denote (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1) ◦ αL. Since (GKC , φ ◦ ψ, γ ◦ ψ) is an admissible
triple and since γ(ψ(ae+1)) = γ(λµk) has inﬁnite order in G, it follows from The-
orem 5.9 that C(2)
∗ (MKC , φ ◦ ψ, γ ◦ ψ, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class
and

T (2)(MKC , φ ◦ ψ, γ ◦ ψ)(t)
˙= max(1, t)(e−1)|φ(ψ(ae+1))|
= max(1, t)(e−1)|ne+1+kn1+...+kne|.

Since ML and MKC are homeomorphic, they are simple homotopy equivalent

and the result follows from Theorem 3.1.

T × [−1; 1]. We identify T ∼= T × {0} to the torus on which the torus knot T (p, q)
is drawn.

The space Z = T \ V (T (p, q)) is homeomorphic to an annulus. Let δ be a curve
that generates π1(Z). The curve δ is thus locally parallel to the torus knot T (p, q).
See Figure 6 for clarity.

Theorem 5.12. The L2-Alexander torsion for the exterior of the link
L = T (p, q) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh exists for all admissible triples (GL, (n1, n2, n3) ◦ αL, γ) such
that the homotopy class of the curve δ is sent by γ to an element of inﬁnite order,
and for all t > 0. One has:

T (2)(ML, (n1, n2, n3) ◦ αL, γ)(t) ˙= max(1, t)|pqn1+pn2+qn3|.

Proof. The torus T separates MH in two thickened tori N1 = V (Hv) \ Hv and
N2 = V (Hh) \ Hh.

Let X = ML, A = N1 ∪ T \ V (T (p, q)), B = N2 ∪ T \ V (T (p, q)) and Z =
T \ V (T (p, q)), so that X = A ∪ B and Z = A ∩ B, and X, A, B, Z are path
connected. We pick a base point pt ∈ Z for all the following fundamental groups.
The space Z is an annulus, and its group πZ = π1(Z) is isomorphic to Z and is

generated by an element δ that runs between the p strands of T (p, q).

The space A is homeomorphic to a thickened torus, by ﬁlling the missing surface
lines of V (T (p, q)). Let (y, λ) be a preferred meridian-longitude system of A, as in
Figure 5. Note that λ acts as a meridian of the unknot Hv. The group πA = π1(A)
has the presentation hy, λ|yλ = λyi and is isomorphic to Z2.

Similarly, the space B is homeomorphic to a thickened torus, by ﬁlling the miss-
ing surface lines of V (T (p, q)). Let (m, c) be a preferred meridian-longitude system
of A. Note that m acts as a meridian of the unknot Hh. The group πB = π1(B)
has the presentation hm, c|mc = cmi and is isomorphic to Z2.

The element z is sent to λpyq in πA and to cpmq in πB. Thus the group GL =

π1(X) admits the presentation

hy, λ, c, m|λpyq = cpmq, yλ = λy, mc = cmi

by the Seifert van Kampen theorem.

has inﬁnite order in G. Therefore γ(πA) and γ(πB) are inﬁnite and it follows from

5.6. The link T (ep, eq)∪Hv ∪Hh. We can now compute the L2-Alexander torsions

cable on the torus knot K = T (p, q) (one can ﬁnd a proof of this result due to P.

In Figure 7, we draw a torus link T (e, epq) inside a solid torus S3 \ V (HK ), the
link T (p, q) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh, and the torus link T (ep, eq) which is a (e, epq)-cable on
T (p, q) (we did not draw Hv and Hh in the third part in order to make the ﬁgure
easier to read). Here p = 2, q = 1, e = 2.

One can see the torus TK (drawn with red dotted lines) that separates MT (4,2)
in the disjoint union of the exterior of the torus knot T (2, 1) in S3 and the exterior
of the torus link T (2, 4) ∪ HK. This torus TK is the boundary of a tubular neigh-
bourhood of K = T (p, q). A preferred longitude lK of K is drawn on the ﬁgure.
We identify S3 \ V (HK ) to the solid torus V (K); the component HK looks like a
preferred meridian of K.

Let M = ML denote the exterior of L = T (ep, eq)∪Hv ∪Hh, A = S3 \V (K ∪Hv ∪
Hh) and B = S3 \ V (T (e, epq) ∪ HK ) (in Figure 7, A is the exterior of the drawing
up right and B of the one up left). We see that M is the toroidal gluing of A and
B along their intersection TK = A ∩ B. The following diagrams are commuative:

As in the previous section, let T be the torus on which K is drawn, and δ a
simple closed curve that generates the fundamental group of T \ V (K). The curve
δ is once again locally parallel to the components of T (ep, eq).

Theorem 5.13. Let e > 2. The L2-Alexander torsion for the exterior of the link
L = T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh exists for all admissible triples
(GL, (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1, ne+2) ◦ αL, γ) such that the homotopy class of the curve δ is
sent by γ to an element of inﬁnite order, and for all t > 0. One has:

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne, ne+1, ne+2) ◦ αL, γ)(t)
˙= max(1, t)e|pq(n1+...+ne)+pne+1+qne+2|.

Proof. Let t > 0. Let φ denote the homomorphism (n1, . . . , ne+2) ◦ αL. We assume
that the homotopy class of δ is sent by γ to an element of inﬁnite order. First, as the
cabling torus TK is the boundary of a tubular neighbourhood V (K) of K = T (p, q)
and contains such a curve δ, the torus TK has thus inﬁnite image under γ, therefore
C(2)
∗ (TK, φ ◦ i, γ ◦ i, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class and its L2-torsion
is 1, by Theorem 4.4.

Secondly, the curve λµk = λµpq of Theorem 5.11 is ambient isotopic to δ, thus
it is sent by γ to an element of inﬁnite order (in Figure 7, λ is written lK, and
µ is parallel to HK), therefore C(2)
∗ (B, φ ◦ jB, γ ◦ jB, t) is weakly acyclic and of
determinant class, and

T (2)(B, φ ◦ jB, γ ◦ jB)(t)

= T (2)(cid:0)S3 \ V (L′), (n1, . . . , ne+2) ◦ αL ◦ jB, γ ◦ jB(cid:1) (t)
= T (2)(cid:0)S3 \ V (L′), (n1, . . . , ne, pne+1 + qne+2) ◦ αL′, γ ◦ jB(cid:1) (t)

˙= max(1, t)(e−1)|pne+1+qne+2+pq(n1+...+ne)|.

where L′ = T (e, epq) ∪ HK.

Finally, the last piece of the toroidal gluing is A = MH \V (K), which corresponds
to the case e = 1 of the previous section; from the assumption on δ, it follows from
Theorem 5.12 that C(2)
∗ (A, φ ◦ jA, γ ◦ jA, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant
class, and

T (2)(A, φ ◦ jA, γ ◦ jA)(t)

= T (2)(cid:0)S3 \ V (L′′), (n1, . . . , ne+2) ◦ αL ◦ jA, γ ◦ jA(cid:1) (t)
= T (2)(cid:0)S3 \ V (L′′), (n1 + . . . + ne, ne+1, ne+2) ◦ αL′′ , γ ◦ jA(cid:1) (t)

˙= max(1, t)|pne+1+qne+2+pq(n1+...+ne)|.

where L′′ = T (p, q) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh.

5.7. The link T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv. The link L = L1 ∪ . . . ∪ Le ∪ Hv = T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv is
obtained from L′ = T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv ∪ Hh by deleting the component Hh, therefore
ML is obtained from ML′ by a ∞-surgery on the boundary component of Hh. This
helps us compute the L2-Alexander torsions of L. Let λh be the homotopy class of
Hh in ML and δ the simple closed curve locally parallel to the strands of T (ep, eq)
as in the previous section. The epimorphism Q : GL′ → GL corresponds to the
trivialization of the curve λh.

Theorem 5.14. The L2-Alexander torsion for the exterior of the link
L = T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv exists for all admissible triples (GL, (n1, . . . , ne+1) ◦ αL, γ) such
that γ(δ) and γ(λh) have inﬁnite order in G and for all t > 0. One has:

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne+1) ◦ αL, γ)(t) = max(1, t)(e|p|−1)|ne+1+q(n1+...+ne)|.

Proof. We will use Theorem 4.7. Here λh corresponds to the curve λ in the assump-
tions of Theorem 4.7. Since γ(δ) has inﬁnite order in G, it follows from Theorem
5.13 that C(2)
∗ (ML′, (n1, . . . , ne+1, 0) ◦ αL′, γ ◦ Q, t) is weakly acyclic and of deter-
minant class, and

T (2)(ML′, (n1, . . . , ne+1, 0) ◦ αL′ , γ ◦ Q)(t) ˙= max(1, t)e|pq(n1+...+ne)+pne+1|.

Since γ(λh) has inﬁnite order in G, it follows from Theorem 4.7 that
C(2)

∗ (ML, (n1, . . . , ne+1) ◦ αL, γ, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class, and

max(1, t)|qn1+...+qne+ne+1|

= max(1, t)(e|p|−1)|ne+1+q(n1+...+ne)|.

5.8. The torus link T (ep, eq). Now we can compute L2-Alexander torsions for
general torus links of the form L = T (ep, eq), where e > 2 is an integer and
p, q are relatively prime integers. The link T (ep, eq) is obtained by ∞-surgery
from T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv on the component Hv. The epimorphism Q : GT (ep,eq)∪Hv →
GT (ep,eq) corresponds to the trivialization of the curve λv.

(cid:3)

Let δ and λh be as in the previous sections, and let λv denote the homotopy
class of Hv in GT (ep,eq). Note that the fundamental group of the torus T (on which
T (ep, eq) is drawn) is generated by classes of curves homotopic to λh and λv. Thus
the equality

δ = λp

hλq

v

stands in GT (ep,eq). This equality and the fact that λhλv = λvλh imply that, for
any homomorphism γ : GT (ep,eq) → G, if two elements of {γ(δ), γ(λh), γ(λv)} are
of inﬁnite order, then the third is of inﬁnite order as well.

Theorem 5.15. The L2-Alexander torsion for the exterior of the torus link L =
T (ep, eq) exists for all admissible triples (GL, (n1, . . . , ne) ◦ αL, γ) such that two of
the three elements γ(δ), γ(λh), γ(λv) have inﬁnite order in G, and for all t > 0.
One has:

T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , ne) ◦ αL, γ)(t) ˙= max(1, t)|n1+...+ne|(e|p||q|−|p|−|q|).

This theorem generalises [8, Proposition 6.2].

Proof. We will use Theorem 4.7. Here λv corresponds to the curve λ in the as-
sumptions of Theorem 4.7. Since γ(δ) and γ(λh) have inﬁnite order in G, it follows
from Theorem 5.14 that

C(2)

∗ (MT (ep,eq)∪Hv , (n1, . . . , ne, 0) ◦ αT (ep,eq)∪Hv , γ ◦ Q, t)

is weakly acyclic and of determinant class, and

T (2)(MT (ep,eq)∪Hv , (n1, . . . , ne, 0) ◦ αT (ep,eq)∪Hv , γ ◦ Q)(t)
˙= max(1, t)(e|p|−1)|q||n1+...+ne|.

Since γ(λv) has inﬁnite order in G, it follows from Theorem 4.7 that
C(2)

∗ (ML, (n1, . . . , ne) ◦ αL, γ, t) is weakly acyclic and of determinant class, and

max(1, t)|pn1+...+pne|

= max(1, t)(e|p||q|−|p|−|q|)|n1+...+ne|.

5.9. General cabling formulas. We can now prove a general cabling formula for
L2-Alexander torsions as a consequence of Theorem 5.14.

(cid:3)

Let L = L1 ∪ . . . ∪ Lc+1 a link in S3, and L′ = L1 ∪ . . . ∪ Lc ∪ L′

c+e
the link obtained by cabling the component Lc+1 by the torus link T (ep, eq) with
p, q two relatively prime integers.

c+1 ∪ . . . ∪ L′

Then M = ML′ = S3 \ V (L′) is obtained by a toroidal gluing of A = ML =
S3 \ V (L) and B = (S1 × D2) \ V (T (ep, eq)) ∼= S3 \ V (T (ep, eq) ∪ Hv) between the
components Lc+1 and Hv.

Let n1, . . . , nc+e ∈ Z. Let γ : GL′ → G be a group homomorphism such that

(GL′ , (n1, . . . , nc+e) ◦ αL′, γ) is an admissible triple. Let t > 0.

Figure 8. The (2, 0)-cabling on the second component of L = L1 ∪ L2

To clarify the notations, let us look a the example in Figure 8. The link L has two
components (c = 1), L1 which is unknotted and L2 which is a trefoil, with linking
number lk(L1, L2) = 1. We do a (2, 0)-cabling on L2 (thus e = 2, p = 1, q = 0), and
the resulting link L′ has 3 components. We glue the tori ∂(V (L2)) and ∂(V ) such
that a meridian of L2 is identiﬁed with mV the meridian of V that circles both
components of T (2, 0). Here N = n2 + n3 and ℓ = n1.

˙= T (2)(ML, (n1, . . . , nc, pN ) ◦ αL, γ ◦ jA)(t) · max(1, t)(e|p|−1)|ℓ+qN |.

This theorem generalises [1, Theorem 4.3].

Proof. First let us prove that

(n1, . . . , nc+e) ◦ αL′ ◦ jA = (n1, . . . , nc, pN ) ◦ αL

and that

(n1, . . . , nc+e) ◦ αL′ ◦ jB = (nc+1, . . . , nc+e, ℓ) ◦ αT (ep,eq)∪Hv .

The group GL = π1(A) is generated by m1, . . . mc+1, preferred meridians of

L1, . . . Lc+1 in ML. We have

((n1, . . . , nc+e) ◦ αL′ ◦ jA)(mi) = ((n1, . . . , nc, pN ) ◦ αL)(mi)

for i = 1, . . . , c since L1, . . . , Lc are the c ﬁrst components of L′.The identity is also
true for i = c + 1, since jA(mc+1) circles the e components L′
c+e p times
and is unlinked with L1, . . . , Lc.

c+1, . . . , L′

The group GB = π1(B) = π1(S1 × D2 \ V (T (ep, eq))) is generated by b1, . . . , be
(preferred meridians of the components of T (ep, eq)) and λ a longitude of the solid
torus S1 × D2 ∼= ∂V (Lc+1). Note that jB(λ) = jA(lc+1) in ML′ where lc+1 is a
preferred longitude of Lc+1 in ML. The identity

(n1, . . . , nc+e) ◦ αL′ ◦ jB = (nc+1, . . . , nc+e, ℓ) ◦ αT (ep,eq)∪Hv

is true on each of the generators bi, i = 1 . . . , e (both terms of the equality are
immediately equal to nc+i), and for λ the second term is equal to ℓ, and the ﬁrst
term is equal to

((n1, . . . , nc+e) ◦ αL′)(jB(λ)) = ((n1, . . . , nc+e) ◦ αL′ )(jA(lc+1))

= ((n1, . . . , nc, pN ) ◦ αL)(lc+1)
= n1lk(L1, Lc+1) + . . . + nclk(Lc, Lc+1) + 0 = ℓ.

We have established that the three diﬀerent coeﬃcents φ of the statement of the
result were indeed compatible. Now, since the cabling torus T = ∂(V (Lc+1)) has
inﬁnite image under γ, the result follows from Proposition 5.1 and Theorem 5.14.
