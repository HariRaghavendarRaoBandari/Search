The regions of existence and stability of dark solitons in the Lugiato-Lefever model with normal
chromatic dispersion are described. These localized states are shown to be organized in a bifur-
cation structure known as collapsed snaking implying the presence of a region in parameter space
with a ﬁnite multiplicity of dark solitons. For some parameter values dynamical instabilities are
responsible for the appearance of oscillations and temporal chaos. The importance of the results for
understanding frequency comb generation in microresonators is emphasized.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Dark solitons, localized spots of lower intensity em-
bedded in an homogeneous surrounding, are a particular
type of solitons appearing in conservative or dissipative
systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium [1]. In the
latter case they are known as dissipative solitons (DSs)
and related structures can be found in a large variety of
systems, including those found in chemistry [2], gas dis-
charges [3], ﬂuid mechanics [4], vegetation and plant ecol-
ogy [5], as well as optics [6], where they are known as cav-
ity solitons. These structures arise as a result of a balance
between nonlinearity and spatial coupling, and between
driving and dissipation. In this work we focus on the ﬁeld
of optics, and study DSs in single mode ﬁber resonators
and microresonators where they are known as temporal
solitons [7]. These systems are commonly described by
the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), a mean ﬁeld model
originaly introduced in [8] in the context of ring cavi-
ties or a Fabry-Perot interferometer with transverse spa-
tial extent, partially ﬁlled with a nonlinear medium. In
temporal systems bright and dark solitons can be found.
Taking into account only second order dispersion (SOD)
two regimes can be identiﬁed, characterized by either nor-
mal or anomalous chromatic dispersion. In the latter case
the only type of DSs that exist are bright solitons arising
in both the monostable [9] and bistable regimes [10–12].
In contrast, in the normal SOD case the main type of
DSs that appear are dark solitons [12–15]. In this work
we provide a detailed analysis of the bifurcation structure
and stability of dark DSs appearing in the normal disper-
sion regime, classifying the diﬀerent dynamical regimes
arising in this system.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II,
we introduce the Lugiato-Lefever model in the context
of temporal dynamics in ﬁber resonators and microres-
onators. We then analyze the spatial dynamics of spa-
tially uniform states (Sec. III), followed in Sec. IV by
an analysis of the bifurcation structure of dark solitons.
In Sec. V we analyze oscillatory and chaotic dynamics

beam splitter and L is the length of the ﬁber.

of dark solitons. We conclude in Sec. VI by discussing
the generality of the analysis provided in the earlier sec-
tions and in particular its relevance to frequency combs
in nonlinear optics.

II. THE LUGIATO-LEFEVER EQUATION

In this section we provide a brief introduction to the
LLE in the context of ﬁber resonators and microres-
onators. We then employ the normalization of [10] to
study the continuous wave (CW) or equivalently the ho-
mogeneous steady state (HSS) solutions of this model and
to determine their temporal stability. Figure 1 shows a
ﬁber cavity of length L with a beam splitter with trans-
mission coeﬃcient T and a continuous wave source of
amplitude E0. At the beam splitter, the pump is cou-
pled to the electromagnetic wave circulating inside the
ﬁber. Under these conditions the evolution of the elec-
tric ﬁeld E ≡ E(t(cid:48), τ ) within the cavity is described by
the following evolution equation [16],

where α > 0 describes the total cavity losses, β2 is the
second order dispersion coeﬃcient (β2 > 0 in the normal
dispersion case while β2 < 0 in the anomalous case),
γ > 0 is a nonlinear coeﬃcient arising from the Kerr
eﬀect in the resonator, and δ0 is the cavity detuning.

Here τ is the fast time describing the temporal structure
of the nonlinear waves while the slow time t(cid:48) corresponds
to the evolution time scale over many round-trips. After
normalizing Eq. (1) we arrive to the dimensionless mean-
ﬁeld LLE [8]:

∂tA = −(1 + iθ)A + iν∂2

where A(x, t) ≡ E(t(cid:48), τ )(cid:112)γL/α is a complex scalar ﬁeld,
t ≡ αt(cid:48)/tR, x ≡ τ(cid:112)2α/(L|β2|), ρ = E0

as a spatial coordinate by analogy with other resonantly
driven systems such as the LLE for spatially extended op-
tical cavities [6, 8] or the parametrically forced Ginzburg-
Landau equation [17].

Owing to the periodic nature of ﬁber cavities and mi-
croresonators, we consider periodic boundary conditions,
i.e., A(0, t) = A(L, t), where L is now the dimensionless
length of the system and choose L = 160 for all numeri-
cal computations. The parameters ρ, θ ∈ R correspond to
the normalized injection and detuning, respectively, and
serve as the control parameters of this system. The pa-
rameter ν represents the SOD coeﬃcient and is also nor-
malized: ν = −1 in the normal dispersion case and ν = 1
in the anomalous dispersion case [9–12]. The present
work is restricted to the case ν = −1.

The steady states of Eq. (2) are solutions of the ordi-

nary diﬀerential equation (ODE)

and are either spatially uniform states (HSSs) or spatially
nonuniform states, consisting either of a periodic pattern
(a spatially periodic state PS) or spatially localized states
(DSs). In this section we focus on the HSSs, A ≡ A0,
leaving for subsequent sections the study of the other
states. The A0 states solve the classic cubic equation of
dispersive optical bistability, namely

However, when θ > 2 the Ab

at a steady state bifurcation with k (cid:54)= 0. This Turing or
Modulational instability (MI) occurs at I0 = 1 and gen-
erates a stationary periodic wavetrain with wave number

stable. From a spatial dynamics point of view (Sec. III)
the MI bifurcation corresponds to a Hamiltonian-Hopf
bifurcation in space (HH). No Hopf bifurcations in time
of the HSSs are possible.

III. SPATIAL DYNAMICS

In this section we investigate the conditions that are
necessary for the presence of exponentially localized
states that approach A0 as x → ±∞. To obtain these
conditions we ﬁrst rewrite Eq. (3) as a dynamical system,

dxU = ˜U
dxV = ˜V

dx ˜U = ν(cid:2)V + θU − U V 2 − U 3(cid:3)
dx ˜V = ν(cid:2)−U + θV − V U 2 − V 3 + ρ(cid:3) ,

(9)

and employ the approach of spatial dynamics, i.e., we
think of the solutions of Eq. (9) as evolving in x, the
rescaled fast time, from x = −∞ to x = ∞ [9, 17–20].
Thus DSs correspond to homoclinic orbits of Eq. (9).

The ﬁxed points of Eq. (9) are the HSSs A0 of the orig-
inal evolution equation (2). The stability of these ﬁxed
points (in space) is determined by the eigenspectrum of
the Jacobian of the system (9) around A0 ≡ U0 + iV0,

The form of this equation is a consequence of spatial
reversibility [21–23], i.e., the invariance of Eq. (2) un-
der the transformation (x, A) (cid:55)→ (−x, A), or equivalently
the invariance of the system (9) under (x, U, V, ˜U , ˜V ) (cid:55)→
(−x, U, V,− ˜U ,− ˜V ). This invariance implies that if λ is
a spatial eigenvalue, so are −λ and ±λ∗, where ∗ indi-
cates complex conjugation. Consequently there are four
possibilities:

1. the eigenvalues are real: λ1,2,3,4 = (±q1,±q2)
2. there is a quartet of complex eigenvalues: λ1,2,3,4 =

(±q0 ± ik0)

3. the

4. two eigenvalues are real and two imaginary:

A sketch of these possible eigenvalue conﬁgurations is
shown in Fig. 3, and their names and codimension are

provided in Table I. The transition from case 1 to case 2
is through a Belyakov-Devaney (BD) [18, 19] point with
eigenvalues (±q0,±q0), while the transition from case 2
to case 3 is via a Hamiltonian-Hopf (HH) bifurcation
[18, 24], with λ1,2,3,4 = (±ik0,±ik0). The transition
from case 1 to case 4 is via a reversible Takens-Bogdanov
(RTB) bifurcation with eigenvalues λ1,2,3,4 = (±q0, 0, 0)
[18, 19] while the transition from case 3 to case 4 is via
a reversible Takens-Bogdanov-Hopf (RTBH) bifurcation
with eigenvalues λ1,2,3,4 = (±ik0, 0, 0) [18, 19]. The un-
folding of all these scenarios is related to the quadruple
zero (QZ) codimension-2 point [18, 19]. As shown in
the next section the transitions between these diﬀerent
regimes organize the parameter space for DSs.

DISSIPATIVE SOLITONS

A. Weakly nonlinear analysis

in Fig. 4, corresponds to a BD transition when θ < 2
and an HH transition when θ > 2. Figures 2(a)-(b) cor-
respond to the case θ < 2; we see that the saddle-node
bifurcation at SNhom,1 corresponds to a RTB bifurca-
tion. In contrast, for θ > 2 SNhom,1 has become a RTBH
bifurcation (Fig. 2(d)). For θ = 2 (Fig. 2(c)) the BD,
HH, RTB and RTBH lines meet at the QZ point. In the
parameter space of Fig. 4 the QZ point corresponds to
(θ, ρ) = (2,
2). The other relevant bifurcation lines in
this scenario correspond to SNhom,2. This point corre-
sponds to a RTB bifurcation in space regardless of the
value of θ.

√

In terms of spatial dynamics, DSs correspond to inter-
sections of the stable and unstable manifolds of the HSS
[23]. In cases 1 and 2 the HSS has a 2-dimensional stable
and a 2-dimensional unstable manifold. These manifolds
are transverse to the 2-dimensional ﬁxed point subspace
of the symmetry (x, A) (cid:55)→ (−x, A) and hence intersect
in a structurally stable way. Therefore we expect DSs
in cases 1 and 2 only.
In case 4, the stable and un-
stable manifolds of the HSS are 1-dimensional and DSs,
although possible, are exceptional [25]. In Fig. 2(b) DSs
bifurcate from both SNhom,1 and SNhom,2. When HH
is present (Fig. 2(d)) DSs bifurcate from HH and from
SNhom,2.

In Sec. IV we show that it is possible to compute
DSs analytically near the bifurcation points that produce
them, and use the resulting expressions to initialize nu-
merical continuation [26] of these states.

In this section we compute weakly nonlinear DSs using
multiple scale perturbation theory near the RTB bifur-
cation corresponding to SNhom,2. The procedure applies
equally around the other RTB point at SNhom,1. Fol-
lowing [17], we ﬁx the value of θ and suppose that the
DSs at ρ ≈ ρt, where ρ = ρt corresponds to the SNhom,2
bifurcation, are captured by the ansatz U = U∗ + u,
V = V ∗ + v, where U∗ and V ∗ represent the HSS At
0 and
u and v capture the spatial dependence. We next intro-
duce appropriate asymptotic expansions for each variable
in terms of a small parameter  deﬁned through the re-
lation ρ = ρt + 2δ, where δ is deﬁned in the Appendix.

dark solitons as well. When these are well separated these
states behave like 1-soliton states and so should bifurcate
from the vicinity of SNhom,2 just like the 1-soliton states.
We now discuss the bifurcation structure of dark soli-
tons in two regimes: the bistable region before the QZ
point, namely for
3 < θ < 2, and the bistable region
after QZ, i.e., for θ > 2.

agram. Figure 5(a), computed for θ = 1.95, reveals the
presence of two soliton branches, the ﬁrst of which con-
sists of a single dark soliton in the domain (hereafter
the 1-soliton state, red branch) while the second con-
sists of a pair of identical equidistant dark solitons in
the domain (hereafter the 2-soliton state, green branch).
Figure 5(b) provides a zoom of the region near SNhom,2.
Both branches bifurcate from HSS very close to SNhom,2
as anticipated in the preceding section and both undergo
collapsed snaking [27, 28]. Speciﬁcally, the 1-soliton state
bifurcates from HSS closer to the saddle node at ρ = ρt
and its solution branch undergoes a series of exponen-
tially decaying oscillations in the vicinity of a critical
value of ρ, hereafter ρ = ρM ≈ 1.3506074. During this

mogeneous solutions have equal energy. In non-gradient
systems, such as LLE, such a cycle may still be present,
even though an energy cannot be deﬁned, and we retain
this terminology to refer to its location, i.e., the parame-
ter value corresponding to the presence a pair of station-
ary, inﬁnitely separated fronts connecting At
0 and
back again.

0 to Ab

The successive saddle nodes seen in Fig. 5 correspond
to the appearance of additional oscillations in the tails
of the fronts as the local maximum (minimum) at the
symmetry point x = 0 turns into a local minimum (max-
imum) and back again, and hence to a gradual increase
in the width of the hole. Figure 7 shows a detail of this
process. The associated hole states are temporally stable
between SN1 and SN2, and on all the subsequent branch
segments with positive slope [27, 28], shown using solid
lines. A proﬁle of a stable localized hole on the SN1–SN2
segment is shown in Fig. 6(i). For the value of θ used
in Fig. 5 the collapse of the saddle nodes to ρM is very
abrupt because the spatial oscillations in the tail of the
front decay very fast. Figure 8 shows a clearer example
of the behavior in this region, albeit for a larger value of
θ.

In ﬁnite systems the hole or 1-soliton branch departs
from ρ ≈ ρM when the maximum amplitude starts to
decrease below At
0 and the solution turns into a bright
soliton sitting on top of Ab
0 (Fig. 6(iv)). The branch then
terminates at SNhom,1, where the amplitude of this soli-
ton falls to zero. On an inﬁnite domain the DS branches
bifurcating from SNhom,2 and SNhom,1 remain distinct
and do not connect up. Figures 5 and 6 show that the 2-
soliton branch behaves in a very similar manner. In fact,
this is so for all n-soliton branches (n ≥ 3), provided the
solitons remain suﬃciently well separated.

C. Dark solitons for θ > 2

For θ > 2 the saddle node SNhom,1 becomes a RTBH
point with spatial eigenvalues λ1,2,3,4 = (0, 0,±ik0) and
homoclinic orbits are exceptional [17, 25]. However, in
this case this point is preceded by a HH bifurcation on
Ab
0, which gives rise to a branch of PSs. The PSs bifur-
cate subcritically (Fig. 8) but remain unstable through-
out their existence range, despite the presence of a saddle
node. This is the case for all values of the detuning θ we
explored (2.3 < θ < 10). Thus no bistability between PS
and Ab
0 results and no snaking of bright DSs takes place
[9, 19]. Instead the bright solitons bifurcating from HH
connect to the dark solitons originating at ρ = ρt, as we
now discuss.

Figure 8(a) shows the bifurcation diagram of the 1-
soliton states (red branch) for θ = 4 obtained by nu-
merically continuing the analytical prediction obtained
in Eq. (19) away from SNhom,2. Figure 9(a) shows a de-
tail of this branch. These states are initially unstable
but as ρ increases these unstable 1-soliton states grow
in amplitude and acquire stability at saddle node SN1.
The DS proﬁle on this segment of the branch is shown in
Fig. 10(i). This solution loses stability at SN2 but starts
to develop a spatial oscillation (SO) in the center; solu-
tions of this type become stable at SN3. An example of
the resulting stable solution can be found in Fig. 10(ii).
This process repeats in such a way that between succes-
sive saddle nodes on the left or right a new spatial oscil-
lation is inserted in the center of the dark soliton proﬁle
and the soliton broadens, decreasing its L2 norm. As a
result, as one proceeds down the snaking branch the cen-
tral peak (dip) repeatedly splits. Details of this process
are shown in Fig. 11. The resulting behavior resembles in
all aspects the phenomenon of defect-mediated snaking
described in [28] except for the exponential shrinking of
the region of existence of these states as the hole broad-
ens. Consequently we refer to this behavior as collapsed

defect-mediated snaking. Numerically the collapse oc-
curs at ρ = ρM ≈ 2.1753479. The DSs at this location
correspond to broad hole-like states of the type shown in
Fig. 10(v). As in Sec. IV B further decrease in the norm
signals that the two fronts connecting states At
0 and Ab
0
at ρM are starting to separate (Fig. 10(vi)); this process
continues, resulting in the bright soliton state shown in
Fig. 12(iv); this state is shifted by half the domain width
relative to panels (i)-(vi) of Fig. 10. Thereafter the am-
plitude of the peak at x = 0 starts to decrease and the
1-soliton branch departs from ρM , ultimately connecting
to the branch of small amplitude PS (Fig. 12(i)) that bi-
furcates subcritically from HH (see inset in Fig. 12, top
panel).

Figure 8(a) also shows the 2-soliton state (green line)
that bifurcates from the vicinity of SNhom,2 for θ = 4 just
as in the case θ = 1.95. For θ > 2 this second DS family
plays a key role since it is responsible for providing the
second of the two branches of localized states that are
known to be associated with HH. Figures 9(b), 12 and
13 show how this happens. The green branch in Fig. 9(b)
consists of states with identical equidistant solitons; like
the 1-soliton states, the 2-soliton states proceed to de-
velop internal oscillations (Figs. 10(vii)-(viii)). These un-
dergo a symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation at SNA

the homogeneous states HSS. Panel (b) also shows a
family of nonidentical 2-soliton states (blue line) that
bifurcate from the saddle node SNA on the 2-soliton
branch and also undergo collapsed defect-mediated
snaking. Temporally stable (unstable) structures are

giving rise to a branch of nonidentical solitons (in blue).
One of these gradually acquires complex internal struc-
ture while the other remains unchanged. Figures 10(ix)-
(x) show this state at the locations shown in Fig. 9(b),
while Fig. 13(xii) shows a translate of such a 2-soliton
state by a quarter of the domain size. Figures 13(xii)-
(ix) and 12(xiv)-(xi) show the subsequent evolution of
this 2-soliton state into a single wave packet with a min-
imum at its center x = 0. It is this state that connects
to PS at the same location as the corresponding wave
packet (red) with a maximum at x = 0 that originates
in the 1-soliton state near SNhom,2. In contrast, the 2-
soliton state that also appears near SNhom,2 (green) ter-
minates in a distinct bifurcation on PS, as also shown
in Fig. 12. All three branches undergo collapsed defect-
mediated snaking inbetween. Evidently there are similar
branches that bifurcate from other folds on the 2-soliton
branch (not shown).

We mention that as the domain length increases the
termination point of the 1-soliton (red line) and the non-

8

BD transition for θ < 2 that turns into a HH bifurcation
for θ > 2. The saddle-node bifurcations determine the
regions of existence of the diﬀerent dark solitons shown
previously. With increasing θ the region of existence of
these states becomes broader (Fig. 14(a,b)). In contrast,
when θ decreases the branches of solutions with several
SO progressively shrink, disappearing in a series of cusp
bifurcations C1,...,C4, as shown in Fig. 4.

We distinguish four main dynamical regions, labeled I
to IV in the phase diagram in Fig. 4, on the basis of the
existence of HSS and dark DSs:

Region IV is the main region of interest in this work.
It can be further subdivided to reﬂect the locations of
diﬀerent types of DSs. In the next Section, we refer to
the region between SN1 and SN2, i.e., the region of exis-
tence of 1-SO dark solitons, as subregion IV1. Similarly,
subregion IV2 corresponds to 2-SO dark solitons between
SN3 and SN4 and so on. While both HSS are stable in
region IV, the stability of dark DSs in the various subre-
gions depends on the parameter values (θ,ρ) as discussed
next.

V. OSCILLATORY AND CHAOTIC DYNAMICS

We have seen that the range of values of the parameter
ρ within which one ﬁnds dark solitons increases rapidly
with increasing detuning θ although the interval with sta-
ble stationary dark solitons is reduced by the presence of
oscillatory instabilities that set in as θ increases (Fig. 14).
These intervals of instability open up on the stable por-
tions of the collapsed snaking branches, between pairs
of supercritical Hopf bifurcations on either side. Con-
sequently these instabilities lead to stable temporal os-
cillations resembling breathing of the individual solitons.
To characterize the resulting dynamics we combine here
linear stability analysis in time with direct integration
of the LLE. We also compute secondary bifurcations of

FIG. 10: (Color online) Spatial proﬁles of the solutions
represented in Fig. 8(a) for θ = 4, showing U (x) in
black and V (x) in blue. Panels (i)-(vi) correspond to
1-soliton states (red branches in Figs. 8(a) and 9(a)),
panels (vii)-(viii) to 2-soliton states (green branches in
Figs. 8(a) and 9(b)) and panels (ix)-(x) to the branch of
nonidentical 2-soliton states (blue branch in Fig. 9(b)).

identical 2-soliton branch (blue line) migrates towards
HH and in the limit of an inﬁnite domain the bright
solitons bifurcate from Ab
0 simultaneously with the PS,
exactly as predicted by the normal form for the spatial
Hopf bifurcation with 1:1 resonance [24]. We also men-
tion that, in principle, the Maxwell point ρM may collide
with the saddle node of the PS branch (see [30] for de-
tails). However, we have determined that such a collision
does not occur in the LLE and that the PS branch re-
mains well-separated from the collapsed snaking branches
of dark solitons around ρM (at least in the parameter
range 2.3 < θ < 10).

We turn, ﬁnally, to the structure of the spatial eigen-
values shown in Fig. 8(b,c). Panel (b) conﬁrms that HH
corresponds to a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation in space.
Panel (c) shows that at the termination point of the PS
branch the HSS state Am
0 has 2 purely real and 2 purely
imaginary spatial eigenvalues, indicating that SC corre-
sponds to a global bifurcation in space and not a local
bifurcation. Both HH and SC are formed in the process
of unfolding the spatially reversible QZ bifurcation that
takes place at SNhom,1 when θ = 2.

D. Soliton location in the (θ, ρ) plane

Tracking each bifurcation point in the bifurcation di-
agram as a function of θ we obtain the (θ, ρ) parameter
plane shown in Fig. 4. The green solid line represents a

time-periodic states and point out that in appropriate
regimes the LLE exhibits dynamics that are very similar
to those exhibited by excitable systems.

Figures 14(a) and (b) show that for both θ = 5 and
θ = 10 the single dark soliton becomes unstable in a
supercritical Hopf bifurcation (H−
1 ) leading to an oscil-
latory state. Figure 15(i) shows the resulting state at
location (i) in Fig. 14(a). The temporal oscillations dis-
appear upon further decrease in ρ and do so in a reverse
supercritical Hopf at H−
2 , thereby restoring the stabil-
ity of the single dark soliton. For larger values of θ this
behavior not only persists but the soliton with 2 spa-
tial oscillations (SO) also exhibits temporal oscillations
between two back-to-back Hopf bifurcations (Fig. 14(b)).
An example of such oscillatory 2-SO dark soliton is shown
in Fig. 16(i).

Figure 15(ii) shows the corresponding oscillation of the
2-soliton state for θ = 5 at location (ii) in Fig. 14(a). The
solitons oscillate in phase but in a nonsinusoidal manner.
Figures 15(iii)-(iv) show oscillations of a bound state of
two nonidentical dark solitons at locations (iii) and (iv)
in Fig. 14(a). In these states the simple dark soliton on
the left oscillates in a periodic fashion while the struc-
tured dark soliton on the right remains essentially time-
independent. Figure 16(ii) shows a periodic oscillation
of a 2-soliton state for θ = 10 corresponding to location
(ii) in Fig. 14(b). The individual solitons are structured
and oscillate as in panel (i). Once again, both oscillate
in phase.

1 and H−

We can complete the parameter space shown in Fig. 4
by adding the curves corresponding to the oscillatory in-
stabilities at H−
2 . Figure 17 shows the parameter
space with the curves corresponding to the temporal in-
stabilities of the 1-SO and 2-SO dark solitons included;
the saddle nodes of the remaining dark solitons are omit-
ted in order to give a clearer understanding of this be-
havior. Bifurcation lines separating diﬀerent dynamical
regimes are labeled according to Fig. 14. With increas-

ing θ the Hopf bifurcation H−
1 of the single dark DS ap-
proaches SN1 and we see that both lines are almost tan-
gent although, for the parameter values presented, they
do not meet. The same scenario repeats for the Hopf
bifurcation H−

3 of the 2-SO state.

1 and H−

This scenario can be better understood by looking at
Fig. 18 where several slices of Fig. 17 at diﬀerent values
of θ are shown. We choose to plot ||A||inf := min(|A|)
instead of the L2 norm to improve the clarity of the bi-
furcation diagram, and denote the maximum and mini-
mum amplitude of the oscillatory DSs using crosses. The
diagram in Fig. 18(a) corresponds to a cut of Fig. 17
at θ = 4.6. At this θ value the oscillatory state bifur-
cates from H−
1 , grows in amplitude as ρ decreases, be-
fore reconnecting to the stationary DS at H−
2 in a re-
verse Hopf bifurcation. For larger θ, the amplitude of
the limit cycle between H−
2 increases, and at
some point the cycle undergoes a period-doubling (PD)
bifurcation, starting a route to a chaotic attractor. This
happens already at θ = 5 as can be seen in Fig. 18(b). At
θ = 5.2 (Fig. 18(c)) the chaotic attractor touches the sad-
dle branch S corresponding to unstable dark solitons and
disappears through a boundary crisis (BC) [31]. Let us
discuss this process in detail for the cycle emerging from
H−
2 (the case of H−
1 is analogous). In Fig. 19 we show a
zoom of the diagram in Fig. 18(c) close to BC2 and in
Fig. 20 a series of panels characterizing the cycle at dif-
ferent values of ρ is shown. From left to right we show a
series of time traces corresponding to the temporal evolu-
tion of the minima of the soliton, i.e., ||A||inf , the Fourier
transform of these time traces, a two-dimensional phase
space projection onto (U (x0, t), V (x0, t)), x0 being the
position of the center of the structure, and a zoom of the
phase space. Panel (a) in Fig. 20 corresponds to the sit-
uation at ρ = 2.70248 in Fig. 19 labeled with (a). As we
can see in the time trace and in the frequency spectrum,
the cycle has a single period. In the phase space shown
in Fig. 20 we observe a ﬁxed point corresponding to At
0,

10

(b) in Fig. 19 the time trace and the spectrum reveal that
the cycle has period two as can also be discerned from the
phase space projection. In Fig. 20(c) for ρ = 2.71528 the
cycle has just suﬀered another period-doubling resulting
a cycle with period four. Finally, Fig. 20(d) shows the
situation for ρ = 2.72178, where the cycle has become a
chaotic attractor. At this parameter value the system is
very close to the boundary crisis BC2 as can appreciated
from the near tangency between S and the chaotic attrac-
tor. Once S touches the attractor, the latter disappears
and only At
0 remain as attractors of the system.
The same occurs to the cycles appearing at H−
1 . Using
time simulations we were able to estimate the position
of the boundary crises BC1 and BC2 in parameter space,
labeled in Fig. 17(a). From Fig. 18(c) to Fig. 18(d) we
can see that at the same time as BC1 moves toward H−
1 ,
H−
1 itself approaches SN1 and therefore that the region
of existence of oscillatory DSs shrinks. This behavior can
also be seen in Fig. 17(a).

0 and Ab

At this point we can diﬀerentiate ﬁve main dynami-
cal subregions related to region IV1, i.e., the 1-SO dark
soliton, namely:

1: The 1-SO dark soliton is stable

1: The soliton oscillates with a single period

• IVa
• IVb
• IVc
• IVd
• IVe

1: The soliton oscillates with period two

1: The soliton oscillates with period four

1: Region of temporal chaos bounded by a

boundary crisis (BC2).

The region IV2 of 2-SO dark solitons has the same se-
quence of subregions IVa

2,...,IVe

2, etc.

Close to BC2 (respectively, BC1) the system can ex-
hibit behavior reminiscent of excitability [32]. Here the
stable manifold of the saddle soliton S acts as a sepa-
ratrix or threshold in the sense that perturbations of At
0
across that threshold do not relax immediately to At
0 but
lead ﬁrst to a large excursion in phase space before re-
laxing to At
0. In this case the excursion corresponds to
what is known as a chaotic transient, where the system
exhibits transient behavior reminiscent of the chaotic at-
tractor at lower values of ρ [10, 33]. In Figs. 21(a) and (b)
we show two examples of this kind of transient dynamics.
We choose a value of ρ close to BC2, namely ρ = 2.7235,
and modify the parameter ρ for a brief instant using a
Gaussian proﬁle of width σ and height h using the instan-
taneous transformation ρ (cid:55)→ ρ+h(t) exp[−(x−L/2)2/σ2],
where ρ = 2.7235 and σ = 0.781250 with h(t) = −2.55
for 10 ≤ t ≤ 15 and h = 0 elsewhere [34]. As shown in
Fig. 21(a) such a perturbation of At
0 allows the system to
explore the chaotic attractor before returning to the rest
state. In contrast, in Fig. 21(b) the system explores just
one loop of the cycle before returning to the rest state.

FIG. 13: Details of the proﬁle transformation at θ = 4 that changes two nonidentical dark solitons (blue branch in
Fig. 9(b)) into a bright soliton with a minimum at its center x = 0, allowing it to connect to the PS state at the
same location as the 1-soliton state (red branch in Fig. 9(a)) which evolves into a bright soliton with a maximum at
its center x = 0. The 2-soliton state consisting of two identical equidistant solitons (green branch in Fig. 9(b)) also
terminates on PS, but at a distinct location.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work we have presented a comprehensive
overview of the dynamics of the LLE in the normal dis-
persion regime. The bifurcation structure of dark dissi-
pative solitons (DSs), their stability and the regions of
their existence were determined. Three families of dark
solitons, the 1-soliton and two diﬀerent types of 2-soliton
states, located on three intertwined branches undergo-
ing collapsed snaking in the vicinity of the same Maxwell
point, were identiﬁed. The 1-soliton states bifurcate from
the top left fold of an S-shaped branch of spatially homo-
geneous states and terminate either on the lower homoge-
neous steady state (HSS) branch in a Hamiltonian-Hopf
(HH) (equivalently, modulational instability) or at the
bottom right fold, depending on the detuning parameter
θ. On a periodic domain of ﬁnite spatial period, these
bifurcations are slightly displaced from the folds, and in
the case of the HH bifurcation to ﬁnite amplitude on the
branch of periodic states created in this bifurcation. The
2-soliton states consisting of a pair of identical equidis-
tant solitons in the domain follow a similar branch but
branch oﬀ the HSS farther from the folds. This is a ﬁnite
size eﬀect: these states behave like the 1-soliton states
on a periodic domain with half the domain length. The
third branch consists of a pair of nonidentical solitons and

plays a key role: this branch bifurcates from the branch
of identical 2-soliton states in a pitchfork bifurcation; as
one follows this branch to lower L2 norm these states un-
dergo a remarkable metamorphosis into a bright soliton
with a minimum at its center that allows it to terminate
on the periodic states created in the HH bifurcation at
the same location as the 1-soliton states, as demanded
by theory. The details of this transition are captured in
Figs. 12 and 13.

At yet higher values of the detuning parameter θ we
found that the localized states undergo oscillatory insta-
bilities, and at a certain point a period-doubling bifurca-
tion initiates a period-doubling cascade into chaos. We
have used this observation to determine the regions in pa-
rameter space where diﬀerent stationary and dynamical
states coexist.

2). Here,

We have shown that the bifurcations that organize the
spatial dynamics undergo an important transition at a
Quadruple-Zero (QZ) point, which occurs at (θ, ρ) =
(2,
in the normal dispersion regime, the
Belyakov-Devaney (BD) transition turns into an HH bi-
furcation as the detuning θ increases through θ = 2. For
θ > 2 a spatially periodic pattern bifurcates subcritically
from the bottom homogeneous state at this HH bifurca-
tion. These periodic solutions were found to be unstable,
and hence no stable bright DSs were found. However, the

saddle-node bifurcation of the top homogeneous solution
remains a reversible Takens-Bogdanov (RTB) bifurcation
for all θ >
3. This observation explains the existence
of multiple families of dark DSs in this regime, and their
organization in the so-called collapsed snaking structure
[17, 28]. As mentioned, these dark DSs undergo various
dynamical instabilities for larger values of the detuning
θ.

The bifurcation scenario is largely reversed in the case
of anomalous dispersion, where the same QZ point plays
an equally important role, but now the HH bifurcation
turns into a BD bifurcation when θ > 2 [11, 12]. More-
over, the top homogeneous solution is now always un-
stable and the upper fold never corresponds to a RTB
bifurcation. This reverse character of the bifurcation
points has important consequences. First, dark DSs no
longer exist, although the inclusion of additional, higher
order dispersion can stabilize the top homogeneous so-
lution and hence lead to stable DSs [35]. Second, for
41/30 < θ < 2, a stable periodic solution coexists with
the stable bottom homogeneous solution giving rise to
bright DSs that are organized in a homoclinic snaking

structure [9, 19]. For θ > 2, however, the snaking struc-
ture of such bright DSs breaks down, as will be reported
elsewhere. Finally, despite these diﬀerences in the re-
gions of existence of dark and bright DSs in the normal
vs. anomalous dispersion regime, the temporal dynamics
of the existing solutions are very similar at higher val-
ues of the detuning θ. Here, for normal dispersion, we
reported the existence of oscillatory and chaotic dynam-
ics of dark DSs as the detuning is increased. The same
dynamical instabilities have been observed in the case of
anomalous dispersion at high values of θ, but this time
for bright DSs [10, 11]. This suggests that the unfold-
ing of the dynamics can be related to the same type of
bifurcation point in both cases.

Owing to the strong correspondence between Kerr tem-
poral solitons and frequency combs (FCs), the LLE has
recently attracted renewed interest [36]. FCs consist of
a set of equidistant spectral lines that can be used to
measure light frequencies and hence time intervals more
easily and precisely than ever before [37]. For this reason
FCs open up a large variety of new applications ranging
from optical clocks to astrophysics [37]. We explore the
consequences of the present analysis for FC technology
in a companion paper [15].

are required to obtain a suﬃciently wide region of dark
DSs (region IV) to observe such states experimentally.
However, in recent years, the FC community has become
increasingly successful at reaching the required values of
pump power and detuning. As a result, dark DSs with
diﬀerent numbers of spatial oscillations (SOs) in their
center (see, e.g., Fig. 10) have been experimentally ob-
served [13].
In Ref. [13] dark DSs were found using a
normalized pump power ρ ≈ 2.5 and normalized detuning
θ ≈ 5. Figures 17 and 18 show that around these param-
eter values one can indeed ﬁnd dark DSs with diﬀerent
numbers of SOs that can undergo oscillatory instabilities.
Our analysis provides a detailed map of the regions of
existence and stability of dark DSs, which could serve
as a guide for experimentalists to target particular DS
solutions. We showed that dark DSs exist only in a
well-deﬁned zone within the wider region of bistability
between two stable homogeneous solutions. Within this
zone, dark DSs are organized in a bifurcation structure
called a collapsed snaking structure. The word ”col-
lapsed” refers to the fact that the region of existence of
dark DSs shrinks exponentially with increasing number
of SOs in the soliton proﬁle (see Fig. 8). The collapse of

favors the observation of DSs with a single SO over that
of broader DS with many SO.

Although such a collapsed snaking structure persists
for higher values of the detuning θ, we also showed that
narrow dark DSs with a low number of SOs destabilize
ﬁrst as θ increases (Fig. 14) and start to oscillate in time.
Therefore, at higher values of θ stable dark DSs found ex-
perimentally will most likely have an intermediate num-
ber of SOs. Our general analysis of the multistability
of dark DSs can also explain previous numerical obser-
vations in Ref. [12], where it was shown that the pulse
proﬁle of dark DSs becomes more distorted as the detun-
ing increases. This could be due to the fact that stable
dark DSs with a larger number of SOs are more likely to
be found for higher values of the detuning.

The resulting asymptotic solution for θ = 4 and ρ =

sponding numerically exact solution, obtained using nu-
merical continuation, is shown in red dashed lines. The
agreement is excellent.

For

3 < θ < 2 the saddle node SNhom,1 is also a
RTB bifurcation and the same asymptotic calculation can
therefore be used to compute the DSs present near this
bifurcation. A related calculation can be used to compute
the DS proﬁles near the point HH [17].
