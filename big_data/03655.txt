We report on the measurement of the time required for a wave packet to tunnel through the
potential barriers of an optical lattice. The experiment is carried out by loading adiabatically a
Bose-Einstein condensate into a 1D optical lattice. A sudden displacement of the lattice by a few
tens of nm excites the micromotion of the dipole mode. We then directly observe in momentum
space the splitting of the wave packet at the turning points and measure the delay between the
reﬂected and the tunneled packets for various initial displacements. Using this atomic beam splitter
twice, we realize a chain of coherent micron-size Mach-Zehnder interferometers at the exit of which
we get essentially a wave packet with a negative momentum, a result opposite to the prediction of
classical physics.

The question of the time required for a particle to tun-
nel through a barrier was addressed in the early days of
quantum mechanics [1]. The ﬁrst quantitative study pro-
viding a ﬁnite tunneling time dates back to 1962 [2]. The
diﬃculty to deﬁne such a time lies in the fact that time is
not in general associated with an ordinary observable in
quantum mechanics [3]. As a result there is not a unique
deﬁnition of tunneling time (see discussion in [4]).

Experimentally, this question was addressed in con-
densed matter, attosecond (as) physics and optics.
In
condensed matter physics, it has been investigated when
performing time measurements in electronic systems on
sub-ns timescale. Such studies have been carried out for
instance in GaAs/GaAlAs hetereostructures [5] and in
biased Josephson junctions [6].

More recently, attosecond tunneling spectroscopy shed
light on how electrons quit their atomic binding potential
under the action of a strong optical ﬁeld. Such experi-
ments constitute a real-time observation of light-induced
electron tunneling on a timescale of a few hundreds of as
[7, 8], and even a few tens of as with angular streaking
techniques [9].

The tunnel problem in quantum mechanics can also
be mapped on a wide number of situations in electro-
magnetism including frustrated total internal reﬂection
[10, 11], transmission in 1D photonic bandgaps [12, 13]
or transmission through a waveguide beyond the cutoﬀ
[14]. The corresponding timescales are ns for microwaves
and fs in the visible range. These experiments brought
to the fore the question of superluminal motions.

The tunnel eﬀect plays a key role in the dynamics of
degenerate gases trapped in optical lattices [15, 16]. The
tunneling rate J can be directly measured in situ [17] and
engineered by an appropriate shaking of the periodic po-
tential to design eﬀective Hamiltonians and produce syn-
thetic Gauge Fields [18–20]. The interplay between tun-
neling rate and interactions is at the heart of the many
body physics investigated with cold atoms in optical lat-
tices [21–24], including in the presence of dissipation [25].
However, to date, no direct tunneling time measurement
has been performed in this domain.

In this article, we propose a direct measurement of tun-
neling time of massive particles by studying the out-of-

equilibrium dynamics of a chain of coupled Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) in an optical lattice.
In contrast
with the methods explored in other ﬁelds, we choose pa-
rameters so that roughly half the wave packet tunnels
through the barrier. Using both the quasi-isochronism
of oscillations in the lattice and the packet that has not
tunneled as a reference, we infer precisely the duration
of the tunneling process which could be up to 27 µs, i.e.
1/4 of the oscillation period.

Our experiment starts with a rubidium-87 BEC pro-
In short, 2 × 109 atoms

from a magneto-optical trap are loaded into a magnetic
quadrupole whose gradient is ramped up to 1.8 T/m. Mi-
crowave evaporation is then performed over 15 s to de-

crease the temperature from 300 µK to 30 µK. Atoms
are subsequently transferred to a crossed dipole trap,
formed by two 1064 nm laser beams, which are respec-
tively aligned along an horizontal axis and at 35o from
the vertical, while maintaining a magnetic gradient that
approximately compensates for the gravity. The evapo-
ration in this latter trap yields a pure BEC of 105 atoms
in the low ﬁeld seeker state F = 1, mF = −1.

We then superimpose to the horizontal guide a 1D op-
tical lattice made of two counter-propagating laser beams
at 1064 nm (lattice spacing d = 532 nm). The lattice is
switched on adiabatically in 11 ms using a S-shape time
variation of the intensity of the beams [27]. The rela-
tive phase, 2θ, of the two laser beams is controlled us-
ing two phase-locked synthesizers that drive the acousto-
optic modulators placed on each beam before they enter
the vacuum cell. The 1D potential experienced by the
atoms reads

(1)

where the ﬁrst term accounts for the weak external
potential in which the BEC is produced. The exter-
nal angular frequency ωext results from the combined
trapping of the dipole trap and the magnetic gradient
(ωext = 2π × 25 Hz). The second term accounts for the
lattice potential with a tunable time-dependent phase
θ(t). EL = h2/(2md2) is the lattice characteristic en-
ergy and s a dimensionless parameter characterizing the
lattice depth.

The lattice can be suddenly spatially shifted by a phase
θ(0+) = θ0 (θ0 = 90o corresponds to a shift of half a pe-
riod). This phase jump is performed on an ultrashort
timescale (a few ns) compared to all other timescales
in the system. This shift triggers an oscillation of the
BEC in the lattice. We analyze this oscillation by sud-
denly switching oﬀ all trapping potentials followed by
a tT OF = 25 ms time-of-ﬂight. This provides a mea-
surement of the in-trap atomic momentum distribution.
The observed pattern results from an interference of the
BECs located at each lattice site and is characterized by
peaks associated to the momenta pn = nh/d with n in-
teger (positive or negative) and separated by a distance
htT OF /(md) = 215 µm [28].

For the experimental data presented in Fig. 1, we used
an initial shift of d/4 (i.e. θ0 = 45o) and repeated the
sequence for various holding times in the shifted lattice.
In this way, we access to the dynamics of the BEC in-
side the lattice. After ∼ 25 µs of evolution in the lattice,
the atoms return to the bottom of the potential wells,
acquiring their maximum momentum in the meantime.
This results in a shift of the maximum peak towards the
right (see point B in Fig. 1). Atoms then evolve towards
the opposite turning point that is reached at C. A quar-
ter of period later, we observe two peaks (D1 and D2)
and not just one, revealing in momentum space the split-
ting of the wave packet that occurred at C: a part of the
wave packet (D1) continued its oscillatory motion and

2

another part of the wave packet (D2) tunneled through
the barrier and kept as a consequence its positive mo-
mentum. The potential barrier therefore acts as a beam
splitter.
Interestingly, the second interaction with the
beam splitter that occurs at the next turning point (E)
generates, by constructive interference, only one packet
with a negative momentum.

We start by investigating the oscillatory motion inside
the lattice. The dipole motion of a condensate in an op-
tical lattice has been studied experimentally in Refs. [29–
31] for an initial displacement of the condensate by a few
tens of micrometers, i.e. more than its size, and in the low
depth limit s < 1.2 (with our notation). To compare the
oscillations that result from such a large displacement,
a hydrodynamic formalism was used, which substitutes
a continuum formulation to the discretized formulation
involving the wave functions in each site [32, 33]. The
frequency of the dipole mode in this model is given by
ωdip = (m/m∗)1/2ωext where m∗ is the eﬀective mass, a
quantity that was extracted from the experimental data
[29]. In such experiments, the micromotion of the wave
packets inside each lattice site does not play any role on
the center-of-mass motion. This is to be contrasted with
the case studied in this article for which we have a small
displacement (a few tens of nm) and a deeper optical
potential (s ∼ 3.2). Under those conditions, the micro-
motion plays a major role and the continuous approach
of Ref. [32] is no more adapted. Furthermore, the quan-
tum dynamics that takes place inside each well cannot
be mapped on the classical dynamics [34]. Indeed, de-
spite the relatively large lattice depth, the tunnel eﬀect
still plays an important role on the out-of-equilibrium dy-
namics that we investigate. For an initial shift of d/4, it
increases the oscillation period compared to the classical
case (see Fig. 2).

We investigated quantitatively the extra inertia pro-
vided by the lattice using numerical simulations of the 1D
Gross-Pitaevskii equation [35]. For this purpose, we solve
extX 2)/2 −
the dimensionless equation: i∂˜tψ = [(−∆ + ˜ω2
γ cos2(πX/4 + ϕ) + β|ψ|2]ψ, where the time is normal-
ized to ˜t = ˜ωt with ˜ω−1 = md2/(16) = 24.3 µs for our
parameters, ˜ωext = ωext/˜ω, and γ = π2s/8. The precise
value of the interaction strength β requires a model for
the eﬀective reduction of dimension [36] and a precise
knowledge of the number of atoms per site which diﬀers
from site to site because of the external conﬁnement. As-
suming a transverse Thomas-Fermi proﬁle, we ﬁnd β . 1.
The dipole oscillation period T normalized to ˜ω−1 is plot-
ted in Fig. 2a as a function of the depth parameter s for
various values of the interaction parameter β and ex-
ternal conﬁnement ˜ωext (˜ωext = 1/262 corresponds to
the experimental situation). Remarkably, the curve that
gives the renormalization of the dipole frequency appears
to be independent of the external potential strength in
the limit ωext ≪ h/(md2) (see [37]). This property diﬀers
from the low depth result [29, 30, 32]. Additionally, the
dipole mode that we excite turns out to be independent of
the strength of the interaction. This well-known feature

for a single well remains valid for our chain of coupled
wells. This was also pointed out in [32] for large ampli-
tude oscillations in the low depth limit. We have numer-
ically checked these two properties, and we can therefore
precisely infer the potential depth from the ﬁrst dipole
oscillation period. We experimentally measure a period
T = 106 ± 4 µs (˜ωT = 4.36 ± 0.14), that corresponds to
s0 = 3.21 ± 0.12 according to Fig. 2a (arrow). For this
depth, the potential accommodates for two bound states
[37].

FIG. 2: (a) Collective dipole mode period measured in dimen-
sionless units as a function of the lattice depth (normalized to
the lattice characteristic energy EL) for various values of the
external potential and the interactions: ˜ωext = 1/50 (trian-
gle), ˜ωext = 1/262 (square), β = 0.1 (open symbol) and β = 1
(ﬁlled symbol). The proximity of the curves enables one to
extract precisely the optical lattice depth (dashed line). The
dotted curve corresponds to the classical oscillation period
[34]. (b) Oscillation period as a function of the initial angle
θ0 (which accounts for the initial sudden displacement of the
lattice): experimental points (ﬁlled square), numerical sim-
ulation with the calibration presented in (a) (empty square)
and classical prediction (dotted line).

Another consequence of the collective nature of the
dipole oscillation is the quasi-independence of the oscil-
lation period on the initial angle θ0 (see [37]). This is il-
lustrated in Fig. 2b where we compare for diﬀerent initial
angle θ0 the period measured experimentally, the result
of the numerical simulation in the same condition as in
the experiment and with the calibration explained above,
and the classical prediction. Within the error bars, the
oscillation period of the dipole mode is constant in the

3

wide range of angle that we studied (30 ≤ θ0 ≤ 80o),
an observation conﬁrmed by numerical simulations (see
[37]). This is to be contrasted with the classical pre-
diction where the non-harmonicities of the wells yield
an oscillation period that strongly depends on the initial
angle. Furthermore, the BEC being put in a far out-of-
equilibrium state by the initial sudden displacement, we
numerically checked that its relaxation towards equilib-
rium does not modify the oscillation dynamics studied
above: the relaxation occurs on a timescale of a few ms,
thus much larger than the oscillation period.

Let us analyze further the experimental time sequence
of Fig. 1. We observe that the centers of the packets D1
and D2 do not coincide in time. The packet D2 that has
tunneled through the potential barrier is delayed with re-
spect to D1. The independence of the period on the ini-
tial angle θ0 ensures that the time delay that we measure
is not aﬀected by anharmonicities. The analysis in mo-
mentum space facilitates the precise measurement of the
time delay since the two packets that split on the barrier
acquire an opposite momentum after a quarter of period.
We investigated systematically this delay through a set
of experiments, with 1 µs time step, for which the initial
angle, and thus the initial sudden displacement of the
lattice, is varied. The data are presented in Fig. 3a. We
observe that when increasing θ0, the relative delay be-
tween the reﬂected (D1) and tunneled (D2) wave packets
decreases. Indeed, as intuitively expected from semiclas-
sical approach, for a larger shift angle, the thickness of
the potential barrier at the turning point decreases and
the turning point corresponds to a higher energy (see
Fig. 3b). To extract the time delay between the wave
packets, we determine the maximum of the density dis-
tributions of the D1 and D2 wave packets (see Inset of
Fig. 3) using as a guide a Gaussian ﬁt of the density dis-
tributions. For θ0 ≥ 60o, the delay cannot be measured
precisely because of the small thickness of the barrier
which yields a partial overlap of packets B and D2. The
numerical simulations are in very good agreement with
the experimental data without any adjustable parameter
once the calibration has been carefully performed (see
Fig. 3c). The error bars on the numerical simulations are
due to the uncertainty on the experimentally measured
period. Remarkably, the numerical simulations show that
interactions do not aﬀect the value of the delay time. For
the smallest displacements (θ0 = 20o and θ0 = 30o), the
dynamics is completely dominated by the bound Bloch
states and the time delay that we measure is therefore
exclusively due to the tunnel eﬀect (see [37]). The con-
tribution of the unbound states grows with θ0 to reach
35% for θ0 = 50o.

In the last part of the time evolution represented in
Fig. 1, we observe that the packet F has a momentum
opposed to that of packet B. Such behavior may appear
surprising at ﬁrst sight: indeed in the absence of tunnel-
ing (classical prediction), one would expect the packet
F to have exactly the opposite momentum compared
to what we observe. This counterintuitive behavior re-

sults from a well-known interference eﬀect occurring in
a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with symmetric
beam paths and 50-50 beam splitters: the exit channel
is the opposite to the entrance channel. The packet of
atoms in B has positive momentum components centered
about h/d. We deﬁne this state as |Bi = |p0i. The po-
tential barrier at the turning point C plays the role of a
coherent beam splitter: |Di = cos ϕ|p0i + i sin ϕ| − p0i.
The conﬁnement driving the subsequent evolution plays
the role of mirrors. At the turning point E the two
packets that have been split are recombined on a sec-
ond beam splitter. The result of this recombination is
read out in momentum space in F : |F i = ((cos ϕ|p0i +
i sin ϕ| − p0i) cos ϕ + i sin ϕ(cos ϕ| − p0i + i sin ϕ|p0i) =
cos 2ϕ|p0i + i sin 2ϕ| − p0i. We infer that the momentum
in F is the exact opposite to that in B for a perfect 50-50
beam splitter (ϕ = π/4).

In our lattice conﬁguration, the interfering packets
originate from two adjacent sites (see Fig. 3b). We there-
fore have multiple MZI working simultaneously and ad-
dressing only the external degree of freedom. We analyze
the exit of the interferometers by interference in momen-
tum space. The constructive interference observed in
Fig. 1 is thus due to the persistence of the global co-
herence of the BEC on the dipole micromotion period
timescale. We numerically checked that this interference
eﬀect is immune to interactions. It however depends on
the lattice depth, which changes the ratio between the
tunneled and the reﬂected parts of the wave packet, and
therefore the population that ends up with the same mo-
mentum as in the entrance channel B. The construc-
tive interference observed in Fig. 1 corresponds to a ratio
Π−1/(Π1 +Π−1) =91 % where Πn is the number of atoms
with momentum nh/d (corresponding to ϕ ≃ π/5). Fi-
nally, after an extra quarter of period, the atoms from F
are back in the initial state A. Therefore, when increas-
ing the evolution time in the shifted lattice, the dynamics
shown in Fig. 1 repeats again and the sensitivity of the
coupled chain of MZI interferometers increases.

In conclusion, we have performed a direct measure-
ment of the tunneling delay time through the barriers
of an optical lattice by studying the time evolution of a
BEC after a sudden displacement of the lattice. The ex-
citation of the BEC by a displacement of a few tens of nm
provides a robust method to calibrate the lattice depth
independently of the external potential, the interactions
and the value of the displacement. As a perspective, this
experiment oﬀers the possibility of controlling the tun-
neling delay time with time-dependent barriers in close
analogy with the Landauer problem [38]. Additionnally
we have observed the constructive interference in a MZI
provided by two successive interactions with the barriers
acting as beam splitter. Such a micron size interferom-
eter could be of interest to measure locally short-range
force at the vicinity of a surface [39–43].
