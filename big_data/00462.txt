ABSTRACT
Cluster star-forming galaxies are found to have an excess of Far-Infrared emission rel-
ative to Hα, when compared to those in the ﬁeld, which could be caused by intense
AGN activity, dust and/or declining star formation histories. Here we present spec-
troscopic observations of Hα emitters in the Cl 0939+4713 (Abell 851) super-cluster
at z = 0.41, using AF2+ WYFFOS on the WHT. We measure [Oii], Hβ, [Oiii], Hα
and [Nii] for a sample of 119 Hα emitters in and around the cluster. We ﬁnd that
17 ± 5% of the Hα emitters are AGN, irrespective of environment. For star-forming
galaxies, we obtain Balmer decrements, metallicities and ionisation parameters with
diﬀerent methods, individually and by stacking. We ﬁnd a strong mass-metallicity
relation at all environments, with no signiﬁcant dependence on environment. The
ionisation parameter declines with increasing stellar mass for low-mass galaxies. Hα
emitters residing in intermediate environments show the highest ionisation parameters
(along with high [Oiii]/Hα and high [Oiii]/[Oii] line ratios, typically twice as large
as in the highest and lowest densities), which decline with increasing environmental
density. Dust extinction (AHα) correlates strongly with stellar mass, but also with
environmental density. Star-forming galaxies in the densest environments are found
to be signiﬁcantly dustier (AHα ≈ 1.5 − 1.6) than those residing in the lowest density
environments (AHα ≈ 0.6), deviating signiﬁcantly from what would be predicted given
their stellar masses.

1 INTRODUCTION

The last decades have seen a tremendous observational,
modelling and theoretical eﬀort towards understanding
galaxy formation and evolution in various environments.
One of the key observables that has now been widely mea-
sured is the star formation rate density (ρSFR), which many

studies have shown to rise out to z ∼ 2 (e.g. Lilly et al.
1996; Karim et al. 2011; Burgarella et al. 2013; Sobral et al.
2013a). Measuring ρSFR as a function of redshift (z), but
also understanding its variation with environment and with
internal processes is key to our understanding and to test
state-of-the-art models (e.g. Illustris, EAGLE; Vogelsberger
et al. 2014; Genel et al. 2014; Schaye et al. 2015; Crain et al.
2015).

In the local Universe, star formation depends strongly
on environment. Clusters are primarily populated by pas-
sive galaxies, while star-forming galaxies are mainly found

in lower-density environments (e.g. Dressler 1980). It is also
well-established (e.g. Best 2004) that the fraction of star-
forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxy den-
sity (often projected local density, Σ) both in the local Uni-
verse and at low (z < 0.5) redshift (e.g. Kodama et al.
2004). Stellar mass and/or internal processes connected with
the stellar mass assembly also play a key role. While mass
and environmental density correlate, it is now possible to
disentangle their roles in the local Universe and at higher
redshift and to show that both are relevant for quenching
star-formation (e.g. Peng et al. 2010; Darvish et al. 2016).

Several studies in a broad range of redshifts have shown
that, on average, many properties of star-forming galax-
ies that are directly or indirectly linked to star formation
activity (e.g. star formation rates, speciﬁc star formation
rates, emission line equivalent widths, main-sequence of star-
forming galaxies) seem to be invariant to their environment
(e.g. Peng et al. 2010; Wijesinghe et al. 2012; Muzzin et al.
2012; Koyama et al. 2013, 2014; Hayashi et al. 2014; Darvish
et al. 2014, 2015b, 2016). Therefore, the main role of the en-
vironment seems to be to set the fraction of quiescent/star-
forming galaxies (e.g. Peng et al. 2010; Sobral et al. 2011;
Muzzin et al. 2012; Darvish et al. 2014, 2016). Nevertheless,
recent studies are ﬁnding that not all characteristics of star-
forming galaxies are independent of environment. For exam-
ple, metallicities and electron densities have been shown to
be a function of environment (e.g. Kulas et al. 2013; Shi-
makawa et al. 2015), with studies ﬁnding that star-forming
galaxies have much lower electron densities and slightly
higher metallicities in high density environments when com-
pared to lower density/more typical environments (Sobral
et al. 2015; Darvish et al. 2015b).

Finding the exact mechanisms of galaxy quenching and
their physical agents is still one of the unsolved problems
in galaxy evolution. Many internal (e.g. stellar and AGN
feedback) and external (e.g. galaxy environment) physical
drivers are thought to be linked to the quenching process.
Several environmental processes that are able to quench
galaxies have been proposed. These include ram pressure
stripping (e.g. Gunn & Gott 1972), strangulation (e.g. Lar-
son et al. 1980; Balogh et al. 2000), galaxy-galaxy interac-
tions and harassment (e.g. Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Moore
et al. 1998), tidal interaction between the potential well of
the environment and the galaxy (e.g. Merritt 1984; Fujita
1998), or halo quenching (e.g. Birnboim & Dekel 2003; Dekel
& Birnboim 2006); see Boselli & Gavazzi (2006) for a review.
The strength and quenching timescale of each physical pro-
cess varies depending on many parameters such as the prop-
erties of the quenching environment (e.g. density, tempera-
ture, velocity dispersion, dynamical state) and those of the
galaxy being quenched (e.g. mass, satellite vs. central). How-
ever, the ultimate consequence of each eﬀect is to quickly or
gradually remove the gas content/gas reservoir of galaxies
or heat up the cold gas so that no further star formation
activity is possible.

There is substantial evidence for the truncation of the
atomic and molecular gas content of cluster galaxies (espe-
cially in the outer parts of the disks), possibly due to ram
pressure stripping (e.g. Cayatte et al. 1990; Boselli et al.
2008; Fumagalli et al. 2009; see also Boselli & Gavazzi 2014
for a review). In principle, the dust distribution within galax-
ies should also depend on their host environment, most likely

truncated outside-in as galaxies fall into the deeper poten-
tial wells of denser clusters. Cortese et al. (2010) showed that
atomic-gas-deﬁcient spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster also
demonstrate signs of deﬁciency in their dust content. Simi-
larly, Cortese et al. (2012) found that the total dust content
of atomic-gas-deﬁcient spiral galaxies in Virgo is lower com-
pared to normal ﬁeld galaxies.

One might naively expect a continuous decline in the
star formation and dust content of galaxies from the ﬁeld to
the dense cores of clusters. However, before galaxies undergo
a full quenching process in dense regions, they may expe-
rience a temporary enhancement in star formation activity,
which may complicate how observations are interpreted. For
example, ram pressure stripping can initially compress the
gas/dust which is favourable for star formation, and thus
increasing the column density of the gas and dust (e.g. Gal-
lazzi et al. 2009; Bekki 2009; Owers et al. 2012; Roediger
et al. 2014). Tidal galaxy-galaxy interactions can lead to the
compression and inﬂow of the gas in the periphery of galax-
ies into the central part, feeding and rejuvenating the nu-
clear activity which results in a temporary enhancement in
star formation activity (e.g. Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Kew-
ley et al. 2006; Ellison et al. 2008). Galaxy-galaxy encoun-
ters are more likely to happen when the interacting systems
do not have extreme velocities (low-velocity-dispersion en-
vironment) and are closer to each other (denser regions).
Intermediate-density environments such as galaxy groups,
in-falling regions of clusters, cluster outskirts, merging clus-
ters and galaxy ﬁlaments provide the ideal conditions for
such interactions (e.g. Moss 2006; Perez et al. 2009; Ton-
nesen & Cen 2012; Stroe et al. 2014, 2015). Therefore, one
might expect a temporary enhancement in star formation
activity and dusty star formation in intermediate-density en-
vironments before the galaxies quench. This has been found
in several studies, referring to the intermediate-density en-
vironments as sites of enhanced star formation rate, star-
forming fraction and obscured star formation activity (e.g.
Smail et al. 1999; Best 2004; Koyama et al. 2008; Gallazzi
et al. 2009; Koyama et al. 2010; Sobral et al. 2011; Coppin
et al. 2012). In practice, ﬁlaments may well be the actual
dominant intermediate-density environment (e.g. Darvish
et al. 2014, 2015b).

The majority of studies rely on the far-infrared (FIR)
or ultra-violet radiation (UV), radio/UV or FIR/Hα ra-
tio as an indicator of dust content of galaxies. Koyama
et al. (2011) performed an Hα survey of the rich cluster
Cl 0939+4713 (z = 0.41), and found a strong concentration
of optically red star-forming galaxies in the group-scale en-
vironment around the cluster. They argue that the excess
of the red star-forming galaxies suggests an enhancement of
dust-obscured star formation in the group environment. By
surveying the same cluster at z = 0.4 with Spitzer (24 µm),
Koyama et al. (2013) found that the 24 µm to Hα ratio in-
creases from low to high density. This could be easily in-
terpreted as an increase in dusty star-forming galaxies from
low to high densities (in line with e.g. Rawle et al. 2012).
However, such high 24 µm to Hα ratios could also mean a
higher fraction of AGN activity and/or declining star forma-
tion histories. This is because the FIR will measure SFRs
over timescales of ∼ 100 Myr, while Hα is much more in-
stantaneous (∼ 10 Myr). Measuring the Balmer decrement

(Hα/Hβ) for star-forming galaxies only (after rejecting any
potential AGN) would allow for signiﬁcant progress.

In this paper, we present a spectroscopic follow-up of the
Hα candidate emitters in Cl 0939+4713 found with Subaru
and Suprime cam (S-Cam) and use data from Koyama et al.
(2013) to study their properties as a function of environ-
ment and internal properties. Section 2 discusses the sample
and its main properties. Section 3 presents the observations
with WHT/AF2, data reduction and emission line measure-
ments. In Section 4 we show and discuss the results: the
properties of individual galaxies, the stacked properties and
the discussion of the results. Finally, Section 5 presents the
conclusions. We use AB magnitudes, a Chabrier (Chabrier
2003) initial mass function (IMF) and assume a cosmology
with H0=70kms−1Mpc−1, ΩM =0.3 and ΩΛ=0.7.

2 SAMPLE AND PROPERTIES

2.1 The cluster

The Cl 0939+4713 cluster at z = 0.41 (Abell 851) is one of
the best-studied clusters at intermediate redshifts, and sev-
eral studies have focused on the cluster central region(s)
(e.g. Dressler & Gunn 1992; Dressler et al. 1994; Stan-
ford et al. 1995; Smail et al. 1999; Sato & Martin 2006;
Dressler et al. 2009; Oemler et al. 2009). Furthermore, wide-
ﬁeld (∼30(cid:48)×30(cid:48)) optical broad-band and narrow-band imag-
ing surveys of this cluster have also been conducted (e.g.
Kodama et al. 2001; Koyama et al. 2011) using S-Cam
(Miyazaki et al. 2002) on the Subaru Telescope (Iye et al.
2004). Wide-ﬁeld observations revealed 10 Mpc-scale ﬁla-
mentary large-scale structures around the cluster based on
the photometric redshift (photo-z) technique. Such struc-
tures around a massive cluster are similar to those found in
other super-structures at z ∼ 0.5 − 0.8 (e.g. Sobral et al.
2011; Darvish et al. 2014, 2015b).

2.2 Narrow-band survey and the sample of Hα

candidates

Koyama et al. (2011) conducted an Hα narrow-band search
around Abell 851. The authors used the NB921 ﬁlter (λc =
9196 ˚A, ∆λ = 132 ˚A) on S-Cam and were able to identify
445 Hα emitting galaxies in and around the cluster (see
Figure 1) down to a rest-frame equivalent width (EW),
EW[Hα+[Nii]] of ∼ 20 ˚A and a star formation rate (SFR)
of ∼ 0.3 M(cid:12) yr−1. Hα emitters are distinguished from other
higher redshift emitters (e.g. Sobral et al. 2013a; Matthee
et al. 2015) using colour-colour selections (see Koyama et al.
2011, for full details). In this paper, we follow-up 214 sources,
a signiﬁcant fraction (∼ 50%, see Figure 1) of the 445 Hα
emitter candidates found by Koyama et al. (2011).

2.3 Multiband photometry and stellar masses

We use multi-band catalogues derived by Koyama et al.
(2013) to obtain information on all the Hα emitters: z(cid:48)
band magnitude, B − I, B − z(cid:48), Hα ﬂux and luminosity
from NB921, and EW(Hα+[Nii]). By using B − I and z(cid:48)
band magnitude, Koyama et al. (2013) derive stellar masses

parent sample and from our spectroscopic sample presented in
this paper. We also show the local projected density of galaxies,
from the lowest to the highest densities. Our spectroscopic sample
probes the entire structure, including the highest densities, even
though the ﬁbre allocation for each single allocation makes it
diﬃcult to target the dense or crowded regions. For an alternative
visualisation of the full environmental density range obtained with
the full galaxy population, see Koyama et al. 2013.

(which essentially uses z(cid:48) magnitudes and a colour). We fol-
low the same methodology and derive masses by using:

log(M∗/1011M(cid:12))[z=0.4] = −0.4(z
where ∆ log M :

We note that the ﬁnal term (−0.2) is added to the equa-
tion when compared to e.g. Koyama et al. (2013) to convert
from a Salpeter IMF to a Chabrier IMF, which we use. The
typical (average) stellar mass of the full parent sample is
109.7±0.6 M(cid:12). For comparison, M∗ for star-forming galaxies
at z = 0.4 is 1010.9±0.1 M(cid:12) (Muzzin et al. 2013; Sobral et al.
2014). The reader is also referred to Koyama et al. (2013)
that shows that Hα emitters in and around Abell 851 follow
the same stellar mass-star formation rate relation as those
in the general ﬁeld (Sobral et al. 2013a, 2014).

We also use local environmental densities as derived in
Koyama et al. (2013), along with cluster centric distances.
We refer the reader to Koyama et al. (2013) for more de-
tails on how the local environment densities were computed.
Local environmental densities vary from log10(Σ)∼ 1.3 to
log10(Σ)∼ 2.7. Brieﬂy, local densities, log10(Σ), are calcu-
lated using all cluster member galaxies (photometric redshift
selected and those which are Hα selected) with the nearest-
neighbour approach, calculated within a radius to the 10th-
nearest neighbour from each source (e.g. Koyama et al. 2011;
Sobral et al. 2011). This method is in very good agree-
ment with more robust density estimators such as adaptive

smoothing and Voronoi tessellation (Darvish et al. 2015a)
and we use it throughout this work.

3 SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS

3.1 Observations: AF2 spectroscopy with WHT

AutoFib2 (AF2; Goodsell et al. 2003) + Wide Field Fi-
bre Optical Spectrograph (WYFFOS; Dom´ınquez Palmero
et al. 2014) is a multi-object, wide-ﬁeld, ﬁbre spectrograph
mounted at the Prime focus of the 4.2 m William Herschel
Telescope (WHT). The AF2+WYFFOS (AF2 for short,
from now on) instrument on WHT is made of 150 science
ﬁbres, each with a diameter of 1.6(cid:48)(cid:48), which can be allocated
to sources within a ∼ 30× 30 arcmin2 ﬁeld of view, although
with strong spatial constraints/limitations. We used the
Red+4 detector and the R316R grism with a central wave-
length of ∼ 8000 ˚A. The central wavelength varies slightly
depending on the ﬁbre and ﬁeld location, but for a source at
z = 0.4 all our spectra cover the main emission lines we are
interested in: [Oii] 3727˚A, Hβ, [Oiii] 4959, 5007 ˚A, Hα and
[Nii] 6584˚A. The R316R has a dispersion of 1.7 ˚A pix−1 and
a resolution of 8 ˚A, which corresponds to a resolution of just
under 6 ˚A at z = 0.4.

We followed up 214 candidate Hα line emitters from
Koyama et al. (2011) using AF2 on the WHT in La
Palma (program ID: W14BN020) on the second half of
four nights during 2015 January 22–25 (see Table 1). Tar-
gets have estimated emission line ﬂuxes at λ ∼ 9196 ˚A of
5 × 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2 to 9 × 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 and esti-
mated (rest-frame) EW (Hα+[Nii]) in the range 20 ˚A to
700 ˚A. We targeted the cluster with 4 diﬀerent conﬁgura-
tions (P1–P4), all centred on the cluster, but with slightly
diﬀerent rotator angles and small oﬀsets, in order to sample
as best as possible the highest density regions, but also the
regions at larger cluster centric distances. P1 targeted 56
Hα candidates, P2 55, P3 52, and P4 targeted 51 Hα can-
didates at z ∼ 0.4. In each conﬁguration, ﬁbres which were
not possible to allocate to targets due to over-crowding were
allocated to sky on the edges of the ﬁeld of view.
The seeing was 1.0–1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) in the ﬁrst two nights (for 2 of
the conﬁgurations), being slightly worse (∼ 1.5− 2(cid:48)(cid:48)) for the
third night (third conﬁguration), and becoming even worse
(2–3(cid:48)(cid:48)) for the ﬁnal night (ﬁnal conﬁguration). Thus, the suc-
cess rate for conﬁgurations P1 and P2 was higher than for
P3 and much higher than P4 (see e.g. Table 1). The sky was
clear for the entire observing run. We observed each con-
ﬁguration with individual exposure times of 900 s or 450 s,
observing an oﬀset sky position for the same exposure time
for roughly every two science frames (AAB). In total, we
obtained ∼ 13 ks of science exposure time and ∼ 4 ks of sky
exposures per conﬁguration. See Table 1 for more details on
the observations.

3.2 AF2 data reduction

In order to reduce the data, we followed the same steps as
described in Sobral et al. (2015). We took biases and lamp
ﬂats both before and after the observations. Arcs were taken
using neon, helium and mercury lamps with the ﬁbres in the
on-sky conﬁguration; the same procedure was followed for

ﬂats. The traces of the ﬁbres on the CCD were curved in
the dispersion direction (y axis on the CCD) and the lamp
ﬂats were used to correct for this distortion. We ﬁt each
(ﬂat) ﬁbre shape with a Y pixel coordinate polynomial as a
function of X coordinate. We correct all of the CCD pixels
with the polynomial obtained for the closest ﬁbre. We note
that these corrections are applied to each conﬁguration (P1–
P4) separately. We also apply the corrections to the biases,
ﬂats, lamp arcs and the science data.

The ﬁnal 2D bias subtracted and curvature corrected
frames were then sky subtracted using the sky position ex-
posure(s). In order to improve the sky subtraction we also
used sky-dedicated ﬁbres to scale the counts. Roughly 20
of such ﬁbres were allocated to sky in each of the 4 point-
ings/conﬁgurations, allowing a robust scaling of the sky. We
further obtained the best scaling factor by minimising the
residuals after sky subtraction. After subtracting the sky,
we extracted sources along the dispersion axis, summing up
the counts. We extracted the signal on the ﬂats, normalised
the ﬁbre response and ﬂat ﬁelded each spectrum in 1D. We
obtained a ﬁrst order wavelength calibration by using the
arcs and obtain a ﬁnal wavelength calibration per ﬁbre by
using the wealth of sky lines (∼ 100 diﬀerent lines, from
λ ∼ 5570˚A to λ ∼ 10000 ˚A) on that particular ﬁbre. We
do this by extracting the co-added sky frames, and extract
each spectrum in the same way as the science spectra. After
matching all the sky lines for each ﬁbre/spectrum individu-
ally, we obtain a wavelength calibration with an error (rms)
of ∼ 2 ˚A (rest-frame ∼ 1.4 ˚A at z ∼ 0.4), of the order of the
pixel scale of ∼ 2 ˚A pix−1.

We further investigate the response curve to derive any
corrections needed to robustly compare e.g. emission lines
being detected at large separations in observed wavelength.
We do this by both using stars with a ﬂat spectrum, and
also by constructing a ﬂat spectrum by stacking the ob-
served spectra without redshifting them and after masking
all emission and absorption lines from the sources them-
selves. For a ﬂat spectrum, we ﬁnd a much higher response
at the lowest wavelengths, making all sources look very blue.
We derive corrections per pointing and apply them to each
individual spectrum, by dividing the spectrum by our cor-
rection. We then check (for sources with suﬃciently high
signal to noise continuum) that our spectra yields colours
consistent with the broad-band colours. We note that this
correction also corrects for the telluric B-band absorption at
∼ 6860 − 6890 ˚A (although this would only aﬀect ∼ 10 % of
our sources, those with z > 0.41).

3.3 Redshifts

We were able to observe 214 out of our full sample of 445
potential Hα emitters spread over an area which is very well
matched to the AF2 ﬁeld-of-view (see Figure 1). The R316R
grating enabled the de-blending of the Hα and [Nii] emission
lines at the redshift of the cluster (z = 0.41; separation of
∼ 20˚A with ∼ 6 ˚A resolution). Our spectra have a wide
enough wavelength coverage to allow us to search for all main
emission lines we need to unveil the nature of the emitters
([Nii], Hα, [Oiii], Hβ and [Oii]).
In order to obtain redshifts for the observed sources
(Figure 2), we ﬁrst search for an emission line at λ ∼ 9196 ˚A
and, if that is found, assign a potential redshift assuming it

ﬂuxes in our sample. Finally, if we fail to detect any line (this
happens for cases where the estimated line ﬂux is the weak-
est), we look for any other emission lines, and we follow the
ﬂag system according to the number of lines found. When
no other emission lines are found and the only line found (at
λ ∼ 9196 ˚A) is at S/N< 5, the source is ﬂagged as 4, and is
not used at all in the analysis. There are 93 sources ﬂagged
as 4 (see Table 2), with the vast majority being sources tar-
geted in conﬁguration 4 (with the poorest seeing) and then
conﬁguration 3 (with the second poorest seeing). Sources
from pointings 1 and 2 in this group are those with the low-
est ﬂuxes in the sample. Within our followed-up sources we
ﬁnd two (2) interlopers: a star and a lower redshift emitter
(z = 0.13301), with the remaining sources being very likely
Hα emitters with redshifts ranging from z = 0.3883 and
z = 0.4125. Our ﬁnal sample is made of 119 sources with
ﬂags 1, 2, 3, and with Hα ﬂuxes > 1.25× 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2
(see Table 2).
We present the redshift distribution of those z ∼ 0.4
sources in Figure 2. We also show the on-sky location of our
spectroscopic sample in Figure 1, which shows that, partic-
ularly due to the diﬀerent conﬁguration set-ups, we are able
to probe the full range of environmental densities (see Figure
3 and also Koyama et al. 2011).

3.4 Completeness and sample properties

Figure 4 shows the relation between Hα+[Nii] ﬂux (based on
narrow-band photometry, so we can compare it with the par-
ent NB sample) and stellar mass, for both the parent sample,
and for our spectroscopic sample. The comparison with the
parent sample shows that our sample recovers the full range
of masses and Hα ﬂuxes, even down to the lowest masses
and also down to the lowest ﬂuxes. Therefore, we apply no
corrections, as the spectroscopic sample is consistent with

is Hα. If at least two other major emission lines are found
matching that redshift (e.g. [Oii], Hβ, [Oiii] or [Nii]), we
measure those positions, determine the redshift for each one,
combine the measurements, and we give the source a ﬂag of
1, as the redshift is based on 3 lines or more. The redshifts
of these sources are the most robust within our sample. If
we ﬁnd only another strong line, we ﬂag the source with a 2.
The redshift is still considered to be robust. These sources
dominate the lower ﬂux part of the sample. If we are not
able to ﬁnd any other emission line apart from that found
at λ ∼ 9196 ˚A, we still assume it is Hα, but we ﬂag these
sources as 3. These sources are the ones with the lowest

use in this paper, compared to all sources that were followed-up,

being drawn from the parent sample. We note that because
of the weighting we applied when assigning the ﬁbres, we
were able to obtain a ﬂux distribution which is much ﬂatter
than the parent sample: this allows us to have good statis-
tics at all masses and at all Hα ﬂuxes/luminosities, instead
of being fully dominated by e.g. the much more numerous
faint Hα emitters.

We also show the distribution of stellar masses for the
samples of Hα emitters in Figures 3 and 4. As a whole, the
sample of Hα emitters at z = 0.41 has a similar stellar mass
distribution to samples of ﬁeld Hα emitters at similar red-
shifts (see Sobral et al. 2014), but with cluster Hα emitters
having higher stellar masses than Hα emitters outside the
cluster (see Koyama et al. 2013).

3.5 SFGs vs AGN in A851

Emission line ﬂuxes are measured by ﬁtting Gaussian pro-
ﬁles, and estimating the continuum directly red-ward and
blue-ward of the lines (masking any other features or nearby
lines). We also measure the rms directly blue- and red-
ward of the lines, and assign that as the noise (1 σ). In
order to diﬀerentiate between star-forming and AGN, the
[Oiii] 5007/Hβ and [Nii] 6583˚A/Hα line ratios are used (see
Figure 5); these have been widely used to separate AGN
from star-forming galaxies (e.g. Baldwin et al. 1981; Rola
et al. 1997; Kewley et al. 2001, 2013). These line ratios are
measured for emission lines suﬃciently close to each other
that dust extinction has little eﬀect.

We note that particularly Hβ can be aﬀected by signiﬁ-
cant underlying stellar absorption and that this can be a very

Figure 4. The dependence of Hα ﬂux (observed, from narrow-
band, without any extinction correction) on stellar mass. We show
the full parent main sample of 445 Hα emitters, and also the
sample of Hα emitters that we use in this paper, compared to the
sample that was followed-up in the 4 pointings/conﬁgurations.
We ﬁnd that Hα ﬂux correlates well with stellar mass, for both
the parent and for our spectroscopic sample. We also ﬁnd that
our spectroscopic sample covers the full stellar mass range of the
parent sample, and also the full range in ﬂuxes of the parent
sample. Due to our weighting in allocating the ﬁbres, the sources
with the highest ﬂuxes were prioritised, leading to a much ﬂatter
Hα ﬂux distribution of the sample: this allows us to have very
good statistics as a function of both Hα ﬂux and stellar mass
for both luminous and less luminous sources, instead of being
fully dominated by the most numerous faint sources in the parent
sample. We note that we also introduce a ﬂux cut where our
sample would not be representative: this is indicated with the
dashed line.

important eﬀect for galaxies with relatively low EW emis-
sion lines, more characteristic of e.g. mass-selected samples,
which pick up galaxies with relatively low star formation ac-
tivity. By deﬁnition our sources are all high EW sources and
highly star-forming. The eﬀect of the absorption is expected
to be small given the large EW. Nevertheless, we further
investigate the potential eﬀect and assess whether a correc-
tion should be applied. We use the results from Darvish et al.
(2015b) which explore a redshift regime, sample and selec-
tion which are very similar to those presented in our study.
The advantage is that Darvish et al. (2015b) spectra are
much higher resolution and signiﬁcantly deeper (as they are
obtained using DEIMOS on Keck). Darvish et al. (2015b)
showed that Hβ Balmer stellar absorption only accounts for
5-10% correction to the Hβ ﬂux. Even the maximum 10%
correction results in only a < 0.05 dex diﬀerence in the line
ratios, smaller than our observational uncertainties. Other
studies (e.g. Zahid et al. 2011; Reddy et al. 2015) also ﬁnd
comparable corrections for similar samples of emission-line
galaxies. Given the small corrections, we decide not to cor-
rect for Balmer absorption. We note, nonetheless, that our
Balmer decrements as a function of e.g. stellar mass agree
very well with Garn & Best (2010), another indication that

However, on
a source by source basis, and particularly for relatively noisy
spectra, Hβ may be underestimated, leading to an over-
estimation of [Oiii]/Hβ. This may be happening to some
of the sources above the maximal starburst line and with
[Nii]/Hα < 0.4.

Figure 5 shows data-points for the line ratios. We only
show sources for which Hα is detected at S/N> 5 and for
which we can measure emission line ratios with S/N> 2, i.e.
for 89 out of 119 sources in our sample. We investigate the
remaining 30 sources in our sample separately by stacking
them.

Figure 5 shows curves from Kewley et al. (2001) and
Kewley et al. (2013) encompassing star-forming galaxies
(grey solid line), and encompassing up to maximal starbursts
(blue dashed line). We use the blue dashed line to separate
between what we now refer as AGN and star-forming galax-
ies. We ﬁnd that out of the galaxies that we can classify (89
sources), 17% of our Hα emitters are consistent with having
AGN activity (15 sources, 13% of full sample), while 70% (62
sources) are star-forming galaxies (see Table 3). From the re-
maining, 12 sources are too close to the boundary between
AGN and star-forming (see Figure 5), so we label them as
‘others’ and we do not use them for the rest of the analysis.
Figure 6 shows how the median stacked spectra of our AGN
compares with a similar stack for our star-forming galaxies,
clearly revealing the strong median diﬀerences of line ratios
and line ﬂuxes. Our stacks are all normalised to the peak of
the Hα emission.

In order to further investigate the nature of the non-
classiﬁable sources (30 sources), we stack them and measure
their median properties. We stack spectra by normalising
them to the peak of the Hα emission. We show the results
in Figure 6 and compare them with equally stacked spectra
of our clear star-forming galaxies and our AGN Hα emit-
ters. We ﬁnd line ratios which are completely consistent with
a likely mix of relatively metal-poor, low mass, and mod-
erately dust-extinguished star-forming galaxies, with lower
ﬂuxes. Our lower S/N sources show emission line proper-
ties and ratios which clearly indicate a star-forming nature,
at least for the bulk of such sample. From now on, we will
use our sample of clear star-forming galaxies, and our low
S/N sample that we have found to be consistent with star-
formation. Thus, our ﬁnal star-forming sample is made of 92
likely star-forming galaxies, after rejecting AGN and those
sources which are too close to the AGN selection region (see
Table 3).

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 AGN fraction as a function of environment

In order to investigate the prevalence of AGN among Hα
emitters in and around the cluster, we evaluate the AGN
fraction for diﬀerent environmental densities and also as
a function of cluster-centric distance. The results are pre-
sented in Figure 7. We ﬁnd that the AGN fraction shows no
signiﬁcant correlation with increasing projected local num-
ber density nor with increasing projected cluster-centric dis-
tance (Figure 7). There is perhaps a very weak trend of in-
creasing AGN fraction with environmental density, but for

bursts and AGN (blue dashed line) from Kewley et al. (2001).

sources: SFGs or AGN. For sources too close to the boundary
between SFGs and AGN, we label them “Others”, and we exclude
them from the analysis of SFGs. There are sources (Unclass) for
which it is not possible to obtain reliable measurements of the
required emission lines to classify them. We instead stack them,
ﬁnding that they are fully consistent with being lower mass, lower
ﬂux SFGs.

all cases at the level of < 1 σ, and thus not statistically sig-
niﬁcant. This is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent
with e.g. Miller et al. (2003), who found an AGN fraction of
∼20 % in the local universe, independent of environment.

Our results therefore show that there is no particular
prevalence of AGN at high densities and/or close to the clus-
ter that could explain the high 24 µm/Hα as a simple con-
sequence of higher AGN fraction at higher densities. Thus,
two main explanations for the elevated 24 µm/Hα as a func-
tion of environmental density for Hα emitters still remain:
dust extinction correlating with environmental density, or
witnessing declining star formation histories, and thus, ef-
fectively, ‘slow’ environmental quenching. In the following
sections we evaluate the properties of the star-forming pop-

clearly reveal the strong diﬀerences between star-forming galaxies
and AGN, particularly regarding the [Oiii] and [Nii] emission lines
(in respect to Hβ and/or Hα): AGN have very strong [Oiii] emis-
sion, comparable to Hα, while star-forming galaxies have [Oiii]
emission lines which are of the same order as Hβ. The stack of
‘Unclass’ sources reveals line ratios which are in excellent agree-
ment with being dominated by star-forming galaxies, but being
a likely mix of lower mass (lower continuum), lower metallicity,
and slightly dustier star-forming galaxies (higher Hα/Hβ). For
the remaining of the analysis, we consider these galaxies as star-
forming.

galaxy by galaxy measurements

4.2.1 Balmer decrement: Dust extinction

The emission line ratio between Hβ and Hα is one of the
most robust means of estimating dust extinction (AHα)
within star-forming galaxies. The Hα/Hβ line ratio (Balmer
decrement) is widely used as an extinction estimator, par-
ticularly up to z ∼ 0.4, as it is relatively easy to obtain both
emission lines. Hα/Hβ line ﬂuxes are measured and used to
estimate the extinction at Hα, AHα, by using:

where 2.86 is the assumed intrinsic Hα/Hβ line ﬂux ra-
tio, appropriate for Case B recombination, temperature of

lehurst 1971). The Calzetti et al. (2000) dust attenuation law

ing local density, at < 1 σ. Right: AGN fraction as a function of

is used to calculate the values of kλ ≡ Aλ/E(B − V ) at the
wavelengths of the Hα and Hβ emission lines, resulting in:

AHα = 6.531 log10 Hα/Hβ − 2.981.

(4)

Individual measurements for high S/N Hα detections
provide an average of AHα = 0.9 ± 0.9. We also ﬁnd a rela-
tion in very good agreement with Garn & Best (2010), with
dust extinction increasing with stellar mass. For individual
detections, we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant trend of dust extinc-
tion with environment. This could lead to the potential con-
clusion that the elevated 24 µm/Hα ratio may not be due to
increasing dust extinction. However, using sources for which
we can measure the Balmer decrement individually biases
our results towards the less dust extinguished sources at all
environmental densities. This can only be solved by means
of stacking – see §4.3.2.

4.2.2 Metallicities

In order to investigate the metallicities of the ionised gas
within the Hα emitters in and around A851, we use both
[Nii]/Hα, but also O3N2. We only compute individual
(source by source) metallicities for our Hα emitters in and
around the cluster that have been clearly identiﬁed as star-
forming galaxies. We note that in §4.3, when stacking, we
remove the AGN and galaxies unclassiﬁed due to being to
close to the AGN selection function, but use the lower S/N
galaxies, consistent with being dominated by star formation,
so that we do not bias our results.

For
our full sample (median stack), we ﬁnd [Nii] / Hα = 0.33 ±
0.19 (see e.g. Figure 6). The [Nii]/Hα line ratio can be used
to obtain the metallicity of our star-forming galaxies (oxy-
gen abundance), [12 + log(O/H)], by using the conversion of
Pettini & Pagel (2004):

12 + log 10(O/H) = 8.9 + 0.57 × log10(N2Hα),
where N2Hα is the line ﬂux ratio [Nii]6584/Hα. The galaxies
in our full sample ([Nii]/Hα = 0.33 ± 0.19) have a median
metallicity 12 + log(O/H) = 8.59 ± 0.19, which is consistent
with solar (8.66±0.05), but we note that we are sampling
galaxies with a large range of masses, and that we ﬁnd a
strong mass-metallicity relation, and thus we need to take
that into account when properly comparing the samples.

(5)

(6)

We also use the O3N2 indicator (e.g. Alloin et al. 1979;
Pettini & Pagel 2004) as a tracer of metallicity (the gas-
phase abundance of oxygen relative to hydrogen), computed
by using:
12 + log 10(O/H) = 8.73 − 0.32 × log10(O3Hβ/N2Hα),
where O3Hβ is the line ﬂux ratio [Oiii]5007/Hβ and N2Hα
is the line ﬂux ratio [Nii]6584/Hα. This indicator has the
main advantages of i) using emission lines which have very
similar wavelengths, thus being essentially independent of
dust attenuation and ii) having a unique metallicity for each
line ﬂux ratio.
By using O3N2, we ﬁnd an average metallicity of
12 + log(O/H) = 8.56 ± 0.15, thus consistent with solar and
completely consistent with the [Nii]/Hα metallicity for the
entire sample of star-forming galaxies. For the remaining of
the analysis in the paper, we will use O3N2 metallicities.

4.2.3 Mass-metallicity relation

We ﬁnd a mass metallicity relation for both [Nii]/Hα
and O3N2 calibrations. The O3N2 metallicities provide
a slightly steeper relation with mass, with a linear ﬁt
12 + log(O/H,O3N2)= 0.120 × log10 M + 7.357, while N2Ha
provides 12 + log(O/H,N2Ha)= 0.074×log10 M +7.861. Our
results are shown in Figure 8.

In Figure 8, apart from showing how metallicity corre-
lates with stellar mass for individual star-forming galaxies in
and around the cluster, we also split our star-forming galax-
ies according to their local densities. We thus divide the
sample into three sub-samples: low density, medium density
and high density. We ﬁt mass-metallicity relations to each
of the sub-samples. While we ﬁnd that star-forming galaxies
residing in the highest local densities have slightly higher
stellar masses (consistent with e.g. Koyama et al. 2013; So-
bral et al. 2013b), we ﬁnd that the mass-metallicity relation
is the same, within the uncertainties, for all environments.
We thus conclude that, for our sample of high S/N star-
forming galaxies, the mass-metallicity is independent of the
local environment. The results are consistent with Sobral
et al. (2013b) at z ∼ 0.8.

star-forming galaxies where we can measure all emission lines and

measure all the lines individually. Our Hα emitters show a clear
mass-metallicity relation, with evolution when compared with the
local Universe. We also split the sample in diﬀerent densities and
ﬁt mass-metallicity relations. We ﬁnd that while they are within
≈ 1 σ, there is a slight trend of higher metallicity for intermediate-
density environments, but the trend is very mild. Overall, our
z = 0.4 Hα emitters show a mass metallicity which is lower by
≈ 0.2 dex from the local Universe.

ratio [Oiii]/[Oii]. We use equation 5 from Nakajima & Ouchi
(2014) which provides qion as a function of [Oiii]/[Oii] and
also takes into account the metallicity, 12 + log(O/H,R23)1:

log(qion) = {32.81 − 1.153y2

+[12 + log(O/H)](−0.48 + 0.0271y + 0.02037y2)}−1,
(7)

where y = log10([Oiii]/[Oii]), and in this case [Oiii] is the
sum of the ﬂux of [Oiii] 4959 and [Oiii] 5007. We ﬁnd a me-
dian of log(qion) = 7.3±0.3, consistent with e.g. SDSS (7.18-
7.51 Nakajima & Ouchi 2014). We evaluate the ionisation
parameter as a function of environmental density and stel-
lar mass in §4.3.

4.3 Properties of SFGs in and around A851 from

stacking

Here we stack our sample in various sub-samples, to investi-
gate relations with both local projected density and stellar
mass. We present the full results in Table 4, but also show
the results in Figures 9, 10 and 11. We use median stack-
ing throughout. Prior to stacking the spectra, we normalise
them to the peak of Hα emission. When stacking as a func-
tion of environment and stellar mass, for star-forming galax-
ies, we neglect AGN and sources which are too close to the
AGN boundary and thus were not classiﬁed (see Table 4).

We compute the ionisation parameter (qion) for our sample
of Hα emitters as a whole. In order to do this, we use the

The following Sections present the results of stacking as

a function of stellar mass and environmental density.

4.3.1 Ionisation parameter

Our results are presented in Figure 9. We ﬁnd that while
the ionisation parameter seems to be very low at the low-
est environmental densities (where we ﬁnd the lowest star-
formation rates), from log10 Σ10 > 1.6 we ﬁnd a decrease
of the ionisation parameter with increasing environmental
density. We ﬁnd the same qualitative behaviour when using
either all sources or just star-forming galaxies (rejecting the
AGNs leads to an overall ionisation parameter at essentially
all environments).

Figure 9 (and Table 4) also shows the dependence of the
median ionisation parameter as a function of stellar mass,
for our Hα selected sources in and around the A851 clus-
ter. We ﬁnd that our lowest mass Hα emitters have by far
the highest ionisation parameters, which is consistent with
e.g. Darvish et al. (2015b). Higher stellar mass sources have
lower ionisation parameters, but there is evidence that our
high mass Hα emitters have higher ionisation parameters
than those with a “typical” stellar mass of around 1010 M(cid:12).
We note that our sample is Hα selected, and not stellar mass
selected, and that we ﬁnd a strong monotonic increase of
SFR with stellar mass in our stacks. Thus, for higher stellar
mass galaxies, our Hα selection only picks up the actively
star-forming systems, that will likely have higher ionisation
potentials due to their strongly star-forming (or AGN) na-
ture.

4.3.2 Balmer decrement: stellar mass dominates but

environment matters

Figure 9. Ionisation parameter from stacks as a function of en-
vironmental density (left) and stellar mass (right). Dashed lines
indicate the stacked values for all sources and for star-forming
galaxies only. We obtain stacks using our full sample (yielding
higher ionisation parameters, due to the contribution of AGN)
and using SFGs only. We ﬁnd a potential rise and fall of the ion-
isation parameter with environment, but this is at least partially
driven by the relation we ﬁnd between stellar mass and ionisa-
tion parameter. The ionisation parameter has a much clearer and
simple relation with stellar mass, being the highest for the lowest
stellar masses, and declining with increasing stellar mass.

However, note that for one case (Figure 9), we also evaluate
the ionisation parameter including AGN.
When stacking our 92 star-forming galaxies, we ﬁnd a
median dust extinction of AHα = 1.04±0.08. Detailed results
are presented in Table 4. We note that when stacking our
spectra of star-forming galaxies (and also when stacking our
full sample), we also reveal other lines, such as HeI5876 and
Hγ.

We evaluate the typical dust extinction (AHα) of star-
forming galaxies from Balmer decrements in and around the
cluster as a function of both stellar mass and environmental
density. The results are presented in Table 4 and in Figures
10 and 11.
We ﬁnd that AHα increases very clearly with increasing
stellar mass (Figure 10), from AHα ∼ 0.3 to AHα ∼ 1.6 from
the lowest to the highest stellar masses probed in our sample.

Figure 10. Dust extinction (AHα) obtained from the Balmer
decrement (Hβ/Hα) from stacks, as a function of stellar mass. We
ﬁnd that AHα correlates strongly with stellar mass. We also show
the Garn & Best 2010 statistical relation between dust extinction
and stellar mass: our results are in excellent agreement.

Our results are in very good agreement with the relation
found by Garn & Best (2010), which shows no evolution up
to at least z ∼ 1 − 1.5 (e.g. Sobral et al. 2012; Ibar et al.
2013), and reveals that, statistically, stellar mass is a robust
predictor of AHα.

Nevertheless, Koyama et al. (2013) found that the re-
lation provided by Garn & Best (2010) to correct for dust
extinction could not reproduce dust extinction corrections
implied from the ratio 24 µm/Hα as a function of environ-
mental density. In order to investigate this, we evaluate AHα
as a function of environmental density in Figure 11. Our re-
sults show that AHα rises from 0.6 ± 0.2 at the lowest den-
sities, to AHα = 1.6 ± 0.2 at the highest densities. Our re-
sults in Figure 11 are compared with those in Koyama et al.
(2013), using 24 µm. While the trend that we see is similar,
we still ﬁnd a lower normalisation, but an apparently steeper
slope of the typical dust extinction as a function of environ-
mental density. This could be a consequence of the 24 µm
results being aﬀected by some AGN contamination (which
can have signiﬁcant emission of hot dust). A remaining pos-
sibility is the relation used to transform 24 µm/Hα ratios in
AHα, which is much more uncertain than Balmer decrement
measurements such as the ones we obtain.

In order to further test whether the relation we see could
be driven by dust extinction correlating strongly with stellar
mass, we also show in Figure 11 the dust extinction expected
from the relation between stellar mass and dust extinction.
We compute such dust extinctions by using the median and
range of stellar masses present in each bin of local environ-
mental density. Our results show that the relation between
typical dust extinction and environmental density can not
be explained by stellar mass, as expected from e.g. Figure
3.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have conducted a spectroscopic survey over a well-
deﬁned sample of Hα emitters, selected with wide-ﬁeld

Figure 11. Dust extinction (AHα) obtained from the Balmer
decrement (Hβ/Hα) as a function of local environmental density,
Σ. We ﬁnd that the AHα increases from the lowest to the higher
density regions, in line with what was inferred from increasing
24 µm/Hα ratios as a function of density from Koyama et al.
(2013), which we also show, for comparison. We note that AHα
has been computed only for non-AGN galaxies. We note that dust
extinction correlates with stellar mass in our sample, in line with
Garn & Best 2010 – see Figure 10. Thus, in order to take that
eﬀect into account, we use the median stellar mass of galaxies in
each density bin to predict the dust extinction in that bin, which
we also show. The result are consistent with those presented in
Koyama et al. (2013), i.e., that the increase in dust extinction
seems to be driven by environment, not mass.

narrow-band imaging over A851/Cl 0939+4713 at z ∼ 0.4
(Koyama et al. 2011, 2013). We measured [Oii], Hβ, [Oiii],
Hα and [Nii] for a sample of 119 Hα emitters in and around
the A851 cluster. We also use stacking and obtain Balmer
decrements, metallicities and ionisation parameters to inves-
tigate if the nature, dust properties, metallicities and other
properties vary as a function of environment. Our results
show that:

• About 70 ± 13% of Hα emitters in and around Abell
851 are clearly star-forming, while 17 ± 5% are AGN. We
do not ﬁnd any strong dependence of the AGN fraction on
environment. Thus, the rise of the typical 24 µm/Hα found
in Koyama et al. (2013) is not caused by a potential rise in
the AGN fraction.
• We ﬁnd a strong mass-metallicity at all environments,
with no signiﬁcant dependence on environment.
• The ionisation parameter is found to be the highest
(log10(qion)∼ 7.5 − 7.6) for our lowest mass Hα emitters.
While we ﬁnd that the ionisation parameter falls with in-
creasing stellar masses up to ∼ 1010 M(cid:12), we ﬁnd that, for
an Hα selected sample, the ionisation parameter starts to
increase slightly again (by ∼ 0.15 dex) with stellar mass up
to 1011. This is likely a consequence of our selection, which
yields active massive galaxies.
• The inclusion of AGN rises the ionisation parameter at
• We ﬁnd that Hα emitters residing in the lowest densities
have the lowest ionisation parameters, and that intermedi-
ate environments show Hα emitters with the highest ioni-
sation parameters (≈ 7.3 − 7.4). For higher environmental

all stellar masses and at all environments.

densities we ﬁnd that the ionisation parameter declines by
0.15 dex. Intermediate density environments show the high-
est [Oiii]/Hα and [Oiii]/[Oii] line ratios, typically twice as
large as in the highest and lowest densities.
• We ﬁnd that dust extinction (AHα) correlates strongly
with stellar mass, as in Garn & Best (2010), with stellar mass
being the strongest predictor of AHα. However, we ﬁnd that
our Hα emitters at the highest and lowest environmental
densities deviate signiﬁcantly from what would be predicted
from their stellar masses, likely hinting that the environment
still plays a key role which seems independent of stellar mass.
• Star-forming galaxies in the densest environments are
found to be signiﬁcantly dustier (AHα ≈ 1.5 − 1.6) than
those residing in the lowest density environments (AHα ≈
0.6). The correlation between AHα and environment is not
driven by stellar mass, and deviates the most from what one
would predict based on stellar mass at the lowest and the
highest environmental densities, where likely more extreme
processes may be happening.
