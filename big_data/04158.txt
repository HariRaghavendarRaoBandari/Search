The chaotic eﬀects in a nonlinear QCD

evolution equation

Wei Zhu and Jianhong Ruan

Abstract

The corrections of gluon fusion to the DGLAP and BFKL equations are discussed
in a united partonic framework. The resulting nonlinear evolution equations are
the well-known GLR-MQ-ZRS equation and a new evolution equation. Using the
available saturation models as input, we ﬁnd that the new evolution equation has
the chaos solution with positive Lyaponov exponents in the perturbative range. We
predict a new kind of shadowing caused by chaos, which blocks the QCD evolution
in a critical small x range. The blocking eﬀect in the evolution equation may explain
the Abelian gluon assumption and even inﬂuence our expectations to the projected
Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) and Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC).

Introduction

The QCD evolution equation is an important part in the study of high energy physics.

The linear DGLAP (Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi) equation [1] and BFKL

(Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov) equation [2] are no longer reliable at ultra higher en-

ergy since the corrections of parton recombination. A series of nonlinear evolution equa-

tions, for example, the GLR-MQ-ZRS (Gribov-Levin-Ryskin, Mueller-Qiu, Zhu-Ruan-

Shen) equation [3,4] and BK (Balitsky-Kovchegov) equation [5] were proposed, in which

the corrections of parton recombination are considered.

As we know, the nonlinear iteration equations may have a characteristic solution–

chaos, which has been observed in many natural phenomena [6]. A following question is:

do the nonlinear QCD evolution equations have chaotic solution? Several years ago we

have reported chaos in a new evolution equation [7], which describes the corrections of the

gluon recombination to the BFKL equation at the leading logarithmic LL(1/x) approxi-

mation. The purpose of this work is to detail this discovery after a long consideration.

We begin from the proposal of the new evolution equation. Figure 1 is a schematic

program, which shows that the correlations among initial gluons modify the evolution

equations step by step. The elementary amplitude Fig. 1a together with its conjugate

amplitude constructs the DGLAP equation for gluon. The correlations among the ini-

tial partons are neglected in the DGLAP equation. This assumption is invalid in the

higher density region of partons, where the parton wave functions begin to spatially over-

lap. Therefore, the corrections of the correlations among initial gluons to the elementary

DGLAP amplitude at small x should be considered. To this end, we add possible initial

gluon lines on Fig. 1a step by step. The resulting three sets of amplitudes are listed in

Fig. 1b-1d. It is interesting that these amplitudes produce the BFKL, GLR-MQ-ZRS

equations and a new evolution equation.

new evolution equation, respectively. The dashed line is a virtual current which probing

gluon. Note that the four evolution equations form a closed circuit, which implies a

consistence among four evolution equations.

We will present the derivations of the above mentioned four evolution equations in a

same partonic framework. For this sake, we use the Bjorken frame, where the traditional

parton distributions inside a fast moving target are deﬁned in the factorization scheme.

Note that the BFKL equation was originally derived by using the Regge langauge. In

this work we take an alternative technic to re-derive the BFKL equation in Sec. 2, where

the time ordered perturbation theory (TOPT) [4] is used the same as the Altarelli-Parisi-

derivation in the DGLAP equation [2].

The new derivation of the BFKL equation allows us conveniently to add the corrections

of the gluon fusion on it according to the physical pictures in Fig. 1. We present the

derivation of the new evolution equation in Sec. 3. The nonlinear part of this equation has

IR divergences similar to the linear BFKL-kernel. Naturally, the similar regularization

scheme as in the BFKL equation is necessary. Thus, we use the TOPT-cutting rule [4]

to collect the contributions from the virtual processes in the linear and nonlinear parts

of the new evolution equation. Four evolution equations at small x in Fig. 1 show their

consistence. We discuss the relations among these evolution equations in Sec. 4. We

ﬁnd that the new evolution equation is a natural result following the DGLAP, BFKL,

GLR-MQ-ZRS and BK equations.

Using the available saturation models as the input distribution, we study the numer-

ical solutions of Eq.

(3.46) in Sec. 5. The results show an unexpected solution: the

unintegrated gluon distribution function F (x, k2) in Eq. (3.46) begins its smooth evolu-

tion under suppression of gluon recombination, but when x approaches a small critical

value xc, F (x, k2) will oscillate aperiodically in a narrow k2 range (see Fig. 16). We ﬁnd

that this solution presents the chaotic characteristics. In particular, this solution of Eq.

(3.46) has the positive Lyapunov exponents (Fig. 21), i.e., the solution is chaos.

We indicate that chaos in Eq. (3.46) origins from a serious of perturbations when k

crosses over the saturation scale. The rapid oscillation in chaos in a narrow k2 domain

arises a big shadowing (Fig. 15), which blocks the QCD evolution vis three gluon vertex

(Fig. 14). The chaos eﬀects in Eq. (3.46) are discussed in Sec. 6.

Chaos, which has been observed in nature, is a highlighted phenomenon in nonlinear

physics. We proposed an example where chaos appears in a QCD evolution equation

and it may inﬂuence the gluon distribution function, even change our expectations to the

future large hadron colliders.

In this paper sections 1-4 are the derivation of the new evolution equation; sections

5-6 present the chaos solution of this equation and its eﬀects.

2 The BFKL equation

We consider the following partonic picture of the DIS process. At the lowest order,

the elementary amplitude in Fig. 1a together with its conjugate amplitude constructs

the DGLAP equation for gluon. However, this picture should be modiﬁed at small x

due to the correlations among initial gluons. For example, a possible correction to the

DGLAP-amplitudes are given in Fig. 1b, or detailed in Fig. 2. These processes imply

that a scattered gluon is omitted from two correlating gluons before its radiation. We call

such a correlated gluon cluster as the cold spot, which phenomenologically describes the

correlation among initial partons, where the dark circle implies soft QCD-interactions.

Neglecting the irrelevant part with the evolution dynamics, Fig. 2 can been simpliﬁed as

Fig. 3, where the dashed lines are the time-ordering lines in the TOPT and ”x” marks

the probing place.

The evolution kernel in QCD evolution equation is a part of a complete scattering

diagram. In general, the correlated initial partons have the transverse momenta and they

are oﬀ mass-shell, therefore, the k-factorization scheme is necessary.

In this work we

use the semi-classical Weizs¨acker-Williams (W − W ) approximation [9] to realize the k-

factorization scheme. The W −W approximation allows us to extract the evolution kernels

and to keep all initial and ﬁnal partons of the evolution kernels on their mass-shell.

Fig.3: The TOPT-diagrams corresponding to Fig. 2, the dashed lines are the time

ordered lines in the TOPT and ”x” marks the probing place. These diagrams lead to the

real part of the BFKL equation. For simplicity we neglect some parton lines, all those

partons are incorporated in the un-observed ”X” state in the inclusive process since they

are irrelevant to the evolution kernel.

According to the scale-invariant parton picture of the renormalization group theory

[10] the observed wave function Ψ(x2, k) is evolved from the initial wave functions Ψ(x1, pa)

and Ψ(x1, pb) via the QCD interactions, i.e.,

Ψ(x2, k) = Ψ(x1, pa)ABF KL1 + Ψ(x1, pb)ABF KL2,

where two perturbative amplitudes corresponding to Fig. 3 are

The matrices of the local QCD interactions are

(2.13)

where ǫ is the transverse polarization of the gluon in ǫµ = (ǫ0, ǫ, ǫ3) = (0, ǫ, 0), since the

sum includes only physical transverse gluon states in the TOPT form.

Taking the LL(1/x) approximation, i.e., assuming that x2 ≪ x1, one can get two

similar amplitudes

(2.15)

However, these two amplitudes really occupy diﬀerent transverse conﬁgurations. This is

a reason why the dipole model of the BFKL equation is derived by using the transverse

coordinator-space. However, we shall show that the momentum representation still can

be used to distinguish the diﬀerences between Eqs. (2.14) and (2.15).

The two parton correlation function is generally deﬁned as

|Ψ(x, pa, pb)|2 = f (x, pa, pb)

= f(cid:18)x,

pa + pb

2

, pa − pb(cid:19) ≡ f (x, kc, kab),

(2.16)

where kc and kab are conjugate to the impact parameter and transverse scale of a cold spot.

Equation (2.16) implies the probability of ﬁnding a gluon, which carries the longitudinal

momentum fraction x of a nucleon and locates inside a cold spot characterized by kc and

kab.

In this work we derive the evolution equations in the impact parameter-independent

case. This approximation implies that the evolution dynamics of the partons are domi-

nated by the internal structure of the cold spot. Thus, the evolution kernel is irrelevant

to kc and we shall use

f (x, kab) =Z d2kc

(2.18)

Notice that all transverse momenta in Eqs. (2.4)-(2.13) are indicated relative to the

mass-center of the nucleon target. However according to Eq. (2.17), the evolution variable

is the relative momentum kab, therefore, it is suitable to rewrite all momenta relative to

pb in Eq.

(2.2) and to pa in Eq.

(2.3), respectively. Thus, we replace the transverse

momenta as follows:

pa → pa − pb ≡ kab,

k → k − pb ≡ k0b,

la → kab − k0b = pa − k ≡ ka0,

(2.19)

kab = ka0 + k0b,

(2.20)

and

in Eq. (2.2) since

and

pb → pb − pa = kba,

k → k − pa ≡ k0a,

and

lb → kba − k0a = pb − k = kb0,

(2.21)

in Eq. (2.3). In consequence, we have

Ψ(x1, pa) = Ψ(x1, pb) = Ψ(x1, kab),

(2.22)

and

(2.23)

where we identify two ǫ in Eq. (2.23) since the measurements on (x2, k2

a0) and (x2, k2

are really the same event.

Equation (2.1) together with Eqs. (2.22) and (2.23) provide such a picture: a parent

cold spot with the longitudinal momentum fraction x1 and transverse momentum kab

radiates a gluon, which has the longitudinal momentum fraction x2 and the transverse

momentum ka0 (or k0b). It is interesting that this is a picture like the dipole model but

in the full momentum space. In fact, using the Fourier transformation, one can obtain

the corresponding amplitude in the dipole model [11]

The evolution kernel of the DGLAP equation has infrared (IR) singularities, which

relate to the emission or absorption of quanta with zero momentum. A standard reg-

ularized method is to combine the contributions of the corresponding virtual processes.

We call a cut diagram as the virtual diagram, where one side of the cut line is a naive

partonic deﬁnition without any QCD corrections. A simple calculation of the virtual

diagrams was proposed via the TOPT cutting rule in [4]. Let us summarize the TOPT

cutting rule as follows. When we use a probe to observe the parton distributions inside

the target, we cannot control the probing position. In principle, we should sum over all

cut diagrams belonging to the same time-ordered un-cut diagrams, and these diagrams

have similar singular structure but may come up with opposite signs. The TOPT-cutting

rule presents the simple connections among the related cut-diagrams including the real-

and virtual-diagrams. The BFKL-kernel also has singularities on the transverse momen-

tum space. Thus, we can pick up the contributions from the virtual diagrams using the

TOPT-cutting rule without the complicated calculations.

Fig.4: We call these ﬁgures and their conjugate ﬁgures as the virtual diagrams corre-

sponding to Fig. 3.

Using the TOPT-cutting rule, one can prove that the diagrams in Fig. 4 contribute

a similar evolution kernel as the real kernel but diﬀer by a factor −1/2 × (1/2 + 1/2).

The negative sign arises from the changes of time order in the energy denominators. The

factor (1/2 + 1/2) is due to the fact that the probe “sees” only the square root of the

parton distribution, which accepts the contributions of the partonic processes in a virtual

diagram, and the other factor 1/2 is originated from the symmetry of the pure gluon

process. Therefore, the evolution equation corresponding to Fig. 4 is

Since we calculate the contributions to ∆ ˜F (x, ka0), we should make the replacement b ↔ 0

in Eq. (2.32). Combining the real and virtual parts of the evolution equation, we have

(2.33)

According to Eq. (2.18), the distribution f (x, k) in the TOPT-form contains a singular

factor 1/k4, which arises from the oﬀ energy-shell eﬀect in the square of the energy

denominator.

In order to ensure the safety using of the W − W approximation, we

remove this factor to the evolution kernel and use the following new deﬁnition of the

unintegrated gluon distribution

F (x, k) =

˜F (x, k),

k4
4
ˆk

(2.34)

where ˆk is a unity vector on the transverse momentum space. Thus, Eq. (2.33) becomes

(2.35)

which is consistent with a standard form of the BFKL equation.

The correlations among the initial gluons can be neglected in the dilute parton system.

In this case the contributions of the interference diagrams Figs.3c and 3d disappear. Thus,

the kernel Eq. (2.30) reduces to the splitting functions in the DGLAP equation at the

small x limit, i.e.,

KBF KL(kab, ka0, αs)

Since in this case two initial gluons have the same transverse momentum, we can always

take it to zero and use the collinear factorization to separate the gluon distribution. The

3 The new evolution equation

We consider the evolution kernel based on Fig. 1d, which constructs a new evolution

equation. Notice that the two pairs of initial gluons, which are hidden in the correlation

where the foot-indexes of the relative transverse momenta indicate the corresponding cold

the deﬁnitions

we have

kbc = pb − pc, kb0 = pb − k, k0c = k − pc,

(3.23)

kbc = kb0 + k0c.

(3.24)

We read two momenta k(pb,pc) in Eq. (3.22) as k0c and kb0, respectively. On the other

hand, due to momentum conservation, we have

k(pb,pc)(m) ≡ pb − k = pb − pc − k + pc = kbc − koc = kb0,

and

k(pb,pc)(m′) ≡ k − pc = k − pb − pc + pb = k0b − kcb = k0c.

(3.25)

(3.26)

Note that the two factors k2

b0 and k2

0c in the denominator of Eq. (3.26) are correlated

through Eq. (3.24) and they have double poles as in the BFKL-kernel (2.34).

The result Eq.(3.26) seems irrelevant to pa and pd. However, there are two possible

contributions of the cold spot (pa, pd) to the evolution kernel:

(1) The momenta pa and pd don’t ﬂow into the amplitude Eq. (3.26). Therefore, the

cold spot (pa, pd) in Fig. 6b is independent of the evolution dynamics and its distribution

should be integrated as a unobservable quantity. Thus, the resulting kernel reduces to

the linear BFKL kernel.

(2) The momenta pa and pd ﬂow into the amplitude Eq. (3.26) through m and m′.

The momenta k(pb,pc)(m) and k(pb,pc)(m′) in Eq.

(3.22) are alternatively replaced by

k(pa,pd)(m) = pa − k ≡ ka0 and k(pa,pd)(m′) = k − pd ≡ k0d, respectively. The corre-

sponding amplitudes become

and

where one can introduce

(3.27)

(3.28)

kab ≡ pa − pd = pa − k − pd + k = ka0 + k0d.

(3.29)

In general, the momenta ka0 and k0d in Eqs. (3.27) and (3.28) are undetermined since

la and ld in Fig. 6b are unobserved, they should be integrated out as two independent

variables. Thus, the resulting evolution kernel reduce to the DGLAP-like kernel.

Obviously, the above mentioned two situations should be excluded in our resummation

for getting the leading corrections, unless we have the following restriction conditions

ka0 = kb0,

k0d = k0c,

(3.30)

and they imply that

kad = kbc,

(3.31)

due to Eqs. (3.24) and (3.29). To understand Eq. (3.31), we image that before the probe

interacts with the target, two overlapping cold spots have recombined into a common cold

spot (pb, pc). Therefore the probe always measures the recombination processes of four

initial gluons originated from a same cold spot and sharing a same relative momentum.

Summing all the channels, we derived the evolution kernel corresponding to Fig. 6

and the result reads

In the case of decreasing gluon density, the contributions of the interference terms

(Figs. 7c and 7d) disappear and Fig. 1d return to Fig. 1c. Thus, Eq. (3.32) reduces to

where a power suppressed factor 1/Q2

The correlation function G(2) is a generalization of the gluon distribution beyond the

leading twist. It is usually modeled as the square of the gluon distribution. For example,

G(2)(x, Q2) =

1
πR2
N

G2(x, Q2),

(3.35)

where RN is the correlation scale of the gluons in the nucleon. The deﬁnition (3.35) is

a phenomenological model, which contains an arbitral normalization constant. However,

this constant will be determined through the value of RN by using the experimental data.

The complete GLR-MQ-ZRS equation includes the contributions of the two-partons-

to-two-partons (2 → 2) amplitude, the interference amplitude between the one-parton-to-

two-partons (1 → 2) amplitude and the three-partons-to-two-partons (3 → 2) amplitude.

Where we meet very complicated calculations about the interference- and corresponding

virtual amplitudes. However, the TOPT-cutting rule shows that the above mentioned

amplitudes correspond to a similar recombination kernel except the numerical factor and

the diﬀerent kinematic regions [4].

Another key problem is that we meet various multi-gluon correlation functions, in

which the cut line cuts oﬀ the nonperturbative matrix with diﬀerent ways. Fortunately,

Jaﬀe has shown that these correlation functions on the light-cone has the same form in the

DIS processes [13]. The Jaﬀe-cutting rule was broadly used in the study of the high twist

processes. The TOPT provides a straightforward explanation about the Jaﬀe-cutting

rule: since all backward propagators are absorbed into the nonperturbative correlation

functions, the partons correlating two initial gluons inside the nonperturbative matrix are

on mass-shell. Therefore, the correlation functions with cuts at diﬀerent places are the

same. Thus, the Jaﬀe-cutting rule can be included in our TOPT-cutting rule. Combining

the DGLAP dynamics at small x, the GLR-MQ-ZRS equation reads

(3.36)

where the contributions of the virtual diagrams are canceled each other. The second term

on the right hand-side of Eq. (3.36) is the positive antishadowing part, while the third

term is the negative shadowing part.

Returning to our new evolution equation. We model the correlation function F (2) as

the square of the gluon distribution as in the leading twist case Eq. (3.35), i.e.,

eF (2)(x, kbc) =Z d2keRF (kbc, k)eF (x, kbc)eF (x, k) ≡

(3.37)

where we take the same parameter RN as in Eq. (3.35) since the relation (2.28) is irrelevant

to RN . Using the evolution kernel (3.32), we write

Now let us discuss the contributions from the virtual diagrams. According to the

standard regularization schema, the TOPT-cutting rule shows that the diagrams in Fig.

7 have a similar evolution kernel as that in Fig. 6 but with the diﬀerent kinematical

variables and diﬀer from a simple numerical factor.

The processes in Figs. 6 and 7 contributes the net positive antishadowing eﬀect. The

negative shadowing eﬀect is really originated from the interference processes, two of them

are shown in Fig. 8. Here the contributions from the corresponding virtual processes are

also necessary (see Fig. 9). The TOPT-cutting rule shows that the processes in Figs. 8

and 9 also have a similar evolution kernel.

Fig.10: The TOPT-cutting rule shows a simple relations among virtual diagrams in Figs.

7 and 9. Thus, all diagrams in Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9 contain a similar evolution kernel but

with diﬀerent numerical factors.

Up to now we have separately established the relations of the evolution kernels between

the real and virtual diagrams in the 4-partons-to-4 partons (4 → 4) amplitude and the

3-partons-to-5-partons (3 → 5) amplitude, respectively.

In the next step we will show

that the relationship between the above mentioned two kinds of virtual diagrams will link

up all the four evolution kernels. According to Eq. (3.20), the resulting amplitudes are

irrelevant to the transverse momenta of the initial gluons at x2 ≪ x1. Thus, we use the

relations shown in Fig. 10, which are derived in the collinear factorization schema [4] to

reveal that the two kinds of virtual diagrams diﬀer only from a minus sign, which is from

an energy deﬁcit between two dashed lines in Fig. 9: because both the momenta kb0 and

k0c are indicated by k in the mass-center of the nucleon target, we have

Fig.11: The model for the multi-gluons correlating function based on the TOPT-

cutting rules. The propagator inside the cold spot is forward and on mass-shell at the

W − W approximation, while the correlations to the cold spot from the other part of the

nonperturbative matrix are neglected. Thus, the correlating function can be cut.

In consequence, we ﬁnally link up all evolution kernels and obtain the following equa-

where we assume that the Jaﬀe-cutting rule is still holden in the k-factorization scheme

(Fig. 11). The reasons are as follows: (a) the propagator inside the cold spot is forward

and on mass-shell at the W − W approximation; (b) the correlations to the cold spot

from the other part of the nonperturbative matrix are neglected in our model Eq. (2.17).

Thus, the correlation function can be cut and we can use the same correlation function

in the real, virtual, and interference processes. From Eq. (3.41) we have

Comparing with the GLR-MQ-ZRS equation (3.36), the contributions of the virtual dia-

grams can’t be canceled in Eq. (3.46) and they are necessary for IR safety.

One can ﬁnd the following interesting relations among these equations: The DGLAP

and BFKL equations have the same evolution dynamics (i.e., the gluon splitting), where

we have the following analogy between the real parts of Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2):

The nonlinear parts of the GLR-MQ-ZRS and Eq. (3.46) also have the same evolution

dynamics (i.e., the gluon recombination), they have similar relationships like Eqs. (4.5)

and (4.6):

(4.9)

Thus, we can directly write the real part (4.4) of Eq. (3.46) following the DGLAP, BFKL

and GLR-MQ-ZRS equations.

A complete evolution equation includes the contributions from all possible cut dia-

grams at a given order, including the virtual diagrams for the regularization of the the-

ory. The resulting evolution equations (2.37), (2.35), (3.36) and (3.46) have the following

structure:

DGLAP : real part − virtual parta,

(4.10)

BF KL : real part − virtual part,

(4.11)

GLR − MQ − ZRS(nonlinear part) : real part − virtual partb

−real interf erance part + virtual interf erance partc,

(4.12)

Eq.(3.46)(nonlinear part) : real part − virtual part

−real interf erance part + virtual interf erance part,

(4.13)

where the contributions of the virtual cut diagrams play an important role, although

(a) is neglected at small x [1], (b) and (c) are cancelled each other after the relations

established among the diﬀerent cut diagrams [4]. According to the TOPT cutting rule,

the four nonlinear terms in Eq. (4.13) share a common evolution kernel, and they diﬀer

only by a numerical factor (±1 or ±1/2) and the integration range. Thus, we can write

the complete Eq. (3.46) based on Eq. (4.4).

The BK equation [5] is generally considered as a typical nonlinear correction to the

BFKL equation at the LL(1/x) approximation. We discuss the relation of Eq. (3.46) with

the BK equation. The BK equation is usually written by using the scattering amplitude

The nonlinear evolution kernel in the BK equation is regularized by the connecting am-

plitude N(xbc, x)N(xc0, x) rather than using the virtual diagrams. Using

The similar form of the BK equation in the momentum conﬁguration was used by other

Now we derive Eq. (4.17) but from Eq. (3.46). For this sake, we remove the contri-

butions of Figs. 6c and 6d in the derivation of Eq. (3.46) according to Fig. 12d. Thus,

F 2(x, kb0),

(4.22)

where we take F 2(x/2, kbc) ≃ F 2(x, kbc) near the saturation range. The above derivation

of the BK-like equation indicates that the BK-like equation is a part of Eq. (3.46), where

the contributions from some of interference sub-processes in Figs. 6c and 6d are removed.

Therefore, we can regard Eq. (3.46) as a natural expansion of the DGLAP, BFKL,

GLR-MQ-ZRS and BK equations.

5 Chaos in the new evolution equation

We will focus on the behavior of the solutions near the saturation range, where we

estimate that F (x/2, k2) ≃ F (x, k2) in Eq. (3.46) due to the strong shadowing eﬀect.

Thus, Eq. (3.46) reduces to

(5.2)

The solutions of Eq.(5.2) depend on the strength of the nonlinear terms, which in-

clude the model-dependent assumptions in Eqs. (3.35), (3.37) and a free parameter RN .

For reducing the uncertainty, the value of RN = 4GeV −1 with the assumption (3.37) is

independently ﬁxed by ﬁtting the available experimental data about the proton structure

function using the GLR-MQ-ZRS equation in Ref. [15]. The solutions of Eq. (5.2) need

the knowledge of the gluon distribution with all k2 at a starting x0. A major diﬃculty is

the treatment of the infrared region, k2 < k2

0 (k2

0 ∼ 1 GeV 2). The BFKL evolution leads

to diﬀusion of the starting k-distribution both to larger and to smaller values of k. How-

ever, the perturbative BFKL-growth of F (x, k2) toward smaller k2 is not expected to be

valid when the gluon momenta enter the nonperturbative region. The common feature of

nonperturbative modiﬁcations of the infrared region is that the solution F (x, k2) vanishes

as k2 → 0. The reasons, for example, are the requirement of gauge invariance [16], the

colour neutrality of the probed proton [17], and the absence of the valence gluons in a

static proton [15]. Therefore, the increasing distribution F (x, k2) should be saturated at

k2 < Q2

s(x), Qs(x) is called as the saturation scale.

used the inclusive and diﬀractive scattering data and obtained

where σ0 = 29.12mb, x0 = 0.4 × 10−4, λ = 0.277, R0(x) = (x/x0)λ/2/Qs and Qs = 1GeV .

Note F ≡ F/k2 in Eq. (2.38). The parameter αs is ﬁxed as αs = 0.2. The GBW model

gives a description of F near the saturation scale, although it lacks the QCD evolution.

We draw Finput(x0, k2) = k2FGBW (x0, k2) in Fig. 13 (the solid curve). In the calculations

we divide the evolution region into two parts: region(A) 0 to Q2

s and region(B) Q2

s to

∞. In region(B) the QCD evolution equation is taken to evolute and in region(A) the

nonperturbative part of F (x, k2) is identiﬁed as

F (x, k2) = Ck2FGBW (x, k2), at x ≤ x0, k2 ≤ Q2
s,

(5.4)

where the parameter C keeps the connection between two parts.

The Runge-Kutta method is used to compute Eq. (5.2). Note that F (x, k2) = 0 if

F (x, k2) < 0. The x-dependence of F (x, k2) with ﬁxed value of k2 using Eq. (5.2) is

illustrated by the solid curves in Fig. 14. Surprisedly, the results show that F (x, k2) sud-

denly drops near a critical value xc ∼ 1.3 × 10−6. For comparison, we calculate the BFKL

equation (2.35) and BK-like equation (4.18) with the same input. The corresponding

solutions are presented by the pointed and dashed curves.

Fig. 15 The same solutions in Fig. 14, but where the contributions from the nonlinear

eﬀect increases suddenly near xc.

We plot the contributions from the nonlinear shadowing terms of Eq. (5.2) separately

in Fig. 15 and compare them with the results of the BFKL equation. We ﬁnd that the

shadowing eﬀect increases suddenly in Eq. (5.2) near xc. That is, the QCD evolution is

blocked by an anomalous shadowing eﬀect in Eq. (5.2).

We use the k2-dependence of F (x, k2) in Fig. 16 to expose the origin of the QCD

evolution block. The curves show the aperiodic oscillation and even a dramatic change of

F (x, k2) when x goes to xc near the saturation scale k2 ∼ Q2
s.

values of x (solid curves); The dotted and dashed curves are the corresponding solutions

of the BFKL and BK-like equations; (c) and (d) are parts of (a) and (b), respectively.

The sudden change of a solution is an interesting phenomenon in nonlinear evolution

system, in particular, this behavior perhaps relates to chaos. An important character of

chaos is that the solution is sensitively relevant to the initial conditions. For this sake, we

study the solutions of dependent input conditions. We compute a similar solution as Fig.

16 but the starting point is moved a little from x0 = 0.4 × 10−4 to x0 = 0.35 × 10−4. The

results in Fig. 17 show that the oscillation structure of F (x, k2) ∼ k2 is sensitive to the

starting point of the evolution, although the global behaviors of the curves are similar.

We change the input distribution to 1.01×Eq. (5.4) and compare these results in Fig.

18. One can ﬁnd the obvious diﬀerence in the oscillation structure.

Fig.19: Comparing with Fig. 16 but using the double precisions. The results show

that the oscillations are aggravated with increasing precision.

The improvement of the precision in the computation may aggravate the chaotic oscil-

lations since the increasing samples perturb the distributions at every step in the evolution.

In contrast, if the above mentioned oscillations are arisen from the calculation errors, such

oscillations will disappear with the increasing precision. In Fig. 19 we present the curve

with a same input as in Fig. 16 but with double calculating precision. One can ﬁnd that

the oscillations are aggravated with increasing precision.

The above aperiodic oscillation is sensitive to the initial conditions. Especially, the

oscillation will be enhanced with the increase of the numerical calculation precision. These

features are universally observed in many chaos phenomena.

A standard criterion of chaos is that the system has the positive Lyapunov exponents,

which indicates a strong sensitivity to small changes in the initial conditions [6]. We regard

y = ln 1/x as ‘time’ and calculate the Lyapunov exponents λ(k2) in a ﬁnite region, where

the distribution oscillation is obvious. We divide equally the above mentioned y-region

into n parts with y1, y2.., yn+1 and τ = (yn+1 − y1)/n. Assuming that the distribution

evolves to y1 from y0 = ln 1/x0 and results F (y1, k). Corresponding to a given value

F (y1, k) at (y1, k), we perturb it to F (y1, k) + ∆ with ∆ ≪ 1. Then we continue the

evolutions from F (y1, k) and F (y1, k) + ∆ to y2 from y1 respectively, and denote the

resulting distributions as F (y2, k) and ˜F (y2, k). Making the diﬀerence ∆2 = | ˜F (y2, k) −

F (y2, k)|. In the following step, we repeat the perturbation F (y2, k) → F (y2, k) + ∆ and

let the next evolutions from F (y2, k) and F (y2, k) + ∆ from y2 to y3 respectively and get

the results ∆3 = | ˜F (y3, k) − F (y3, k)|...... (see Fig. 20). The Lyapunov exponents for the

image from y to F (y, k) are deﬁned as

The Lyapunov exponents of the gluon distribution in Eq. (5.2) with the input Eq. (5.4)

are presented in Fig. 21. For comparison, we give the Lyapunov exponents of the BFKL

and BK-like equations. The positive values of the Lyapunov exponents clearly show that

the oscillation of F (x, k)∼k2 is chaos of Eq. (5.2). Therefore, we conclude that chaos in

Eq. (5.2) blocks the QCD evolution of the gluon distribution.

6 Discussions

The exact value of xc depends on the initial conditions, which have some uncertainties,

however, the fact of chaos is irrelevant to the detailed dynamics, provided an essential

change of the k2-dependence of F (x, k2) when the evolution transfers from perturbative

to nonperturbative ranges. For example, an alternative saturation model [19] assumes

that

We use

F (x0, k2) → constant, at k2 ≤ Q2
s.

(6.1)

F (x, k2) = Ck2/(k2 + k2

a), at x ≤ x0, k2 ≤ Q2
s,

(6.2)

with k2

a = 1GeV 2 to replace Eq. (5.4) (for x = x0, see the dashed curve in Fig. 13).

The chaos solutions still exist in Fig. 22 where xc ∼ 1.7 × 10−7. The reason of the chaos

solution in Eq. (5.2) is that this equation contains the following regularized kernels

in the nonlinear terms. The derivation of F (x, k2) with respect to k2 adds a perturbation

on the smooth curve F (x, k2) once k crosses over Qs. Thus, we have a serious of indepen-

dent perturbations in a narrow k2 domain along x (x < x0). In the linear BFKL equation,

these perturbations are independent and their eﬀects are negligibly small. The solutions

keep the smooth curves both on the x- and k2-spaces as shown in Figs. 16cd. However,

the nonlinear Eq. (5.2) may occur the coupling among these random perturbations and

forms chaos near Q2

s. Although we don’t yet know this detail, the positive Lyaponov ex-

ponents of Eq. (5.2) in Fig. 21 strongly support our suggestion. The distribution F (x, k2)

is an evolution result from F (x − ∆, {k2}), where {k2} overlaps a whole kinematic range

including k2 = Q2

s. Once chaos is produced near x ∼ xc and k2 ∼ Q2

s, the fast oscillations

of the gluon density arise a huge shadowing due to Eq. (6.4), and the evolution of the

distribution F (x, k2) is suddenly blocked near xc. The normal shadowing in the GLR-

MQ-ZRS and BK equations origins from a large value of the gluon distribution, while the

big shadowing in Eq. (5.2) is arisen by the rapid oscillations of the chaos solution. We

call this new shadowing as the blocking eﬀect.

Fig.22: Similar to Fig. 14 but the input (5.4) is replaced by the saturation model

(6.2).

The equation (3.46) is constructed based on the leading QCD corrections, where the

higher order corrections are neglected. An important questions is: will the chaos eﬀects

in the new evolution equation disappear after considering higher corrections? We have

pointed out that chaos in the MD-BFKL equation origins from the singularity of the non-

linear evolution kernel. From the experiences in the study of the BFKL equation, higher

order QCD corrections can not remove the singularities at the lower order approximation.

In particularly, the virtual cut diagrams always exit in any higher order corrections to the

BFKL equation. The regularization similar to Eq. (6.4) is necessary. Therefore, we expect

that chaos still exists in Eq. (3.46) even considering the the higher order corrections.

The solution F (x, k2) of Eq. (5.2) becomes zero can not be simply explained as the

gluon disappearance at x ≤ xc. Although the three gluons vertex stops work at x < xc, the

gluons still can evolve similar to the Abliean photons in a thin parton system. In a quark

conﬁnement mechanism, the dual-superconductor picture was suggested by Refs. [20-22],

where an assumption of Abelian dominance seems to be signiﬁcant to conﬁnement. The

Abelian dominance means that only the diagonal gluon component in the conﬁnement

mechanism. According to the Abelian (Cho’sCho-Duan)-decomposition [23], there are

two kinds of gluons: the valence and binding gluons. The binding gluons don’t construct

the legs in a gluon ladder, and they only participate the linear Abelian evolution. The

distributions of the valence gluons collapse at x < xc, the contributions of the binding

gluons appear. One can image that the binding gluons dominate the soft gluons. Thus,

chaos in Eq. (3.46) provides a dynamical mechanism for separating the Abelian gluons.

The blocking eﬀect in the QCD evolution will suppress the new particle events in an

ultra high energy hadron collision. Although we have not exactly predicted the energy

scale xc which corresponding to the blocking eﬀect, the chaos solutions in Eq. (3.46) should

arise our attention when considering the future large hadron collider. In particular, the

nonlinear coeﬃcients in the evolution equation will be enhanced by a factor [1+0.21(A1/3−

1)] in the nuclear target since the correlations of gluons among diﬀerent bound nucleons

[24], this will increase the value of xc into the observable range of the projected Large

Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) [25] and Very Large Hadron Collider (100TeV VLHC)

[26]. Figure 23 presents the nuclear A-dependence of xc. We will detail them elsewhere.

(5.2) but added the nuclear factor

In summary, we derive a new evolution equation in a uniﬁed partonic framework,

where the TOPT cutting rule is used to sum the contributions from the relating cut

diagrams. This new evolution equation sums both the leading ln(1/x) gluon splitting and

recombination contributions. We indicate that the new evolution equation is a natural

expansion of the well-known DGLAP, BFKL, GLR-MQ-ZRS and BK equations.

We ﬁnd that the new evolution equation has the chaos solution with positive Lyaponov

exponents in the perturbative range. We indicate that chaos in this evolution equation

origins from a serious of perturbations when the evolution crosses over the saturation

scale. The fast aperiodic oscillation of gluon distribution with k in chaos leads to a big

shadowing in the new evolution equation. This new kind of shadowing eﬀect may block the

QCD evolution vis three gluon vertex at small x. We point out that the above mentioned

blocking eﬀects relating to the singular structure of the nonlinear evolution kernel in the

evolution equation. Although the position of chaos is undetermined due to the value of

xc is sensitively dependent on the input conditions, the existence of chaos in the QCD

evolution equation may change our expectation to the future large hadron collider plans.
