We employ the multi-orbital dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory to examine the ground state of a three-
orbital Hubbard model with a relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at four electrons per site. We
demonstrate that the interplay between the strong electron correlations and the SOC induces a
Van Vleck-type nonmagnetic insulator and its magnetic exciton condensation. We also ﬁnd in the
moderate electron correlation regime that the SOC induces another type of a nonmagnetic excitonic
insulator, in addition to a relativistic band insulator. The characteristic features among these
insulators are manifested in the momentum resolved single-particle excitations, thus accessible by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments.

Since the observation of an antiferromagnetic (AF) in-
sulator in 5d transition metal Ir oxides A2IrO4 (A = Sr
and Ba) [1–5], many properties of the insulator have been
explored both theoretically and experimentally. These
materials are crystalized in a layered perovskite struc-
ture with nominally ﬁve 5d electrons per Ir in t2g or-
bitals which are separated from eg orbitals due to a large
crystal ﬁeld. The important diﬀerence from 3d and 4d
transition metal oxides is that 5d transition metal ox-
ides show a strong relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
along with the moderate electron correlations. Because
of the strong SOC, t2g orbitals are split into the local
eﬀective total angular momentum j = 1/2 doublet and
j = 3/2 quartet in the atomic limit [6]. The theoretical
and experimental studies have revealed the AF insulat-
ing ground state with the half-ﬁlled j = 1/2 based band,
where the j = 3/2 based bands are completely occupied
[7–18]. The low temperature phase diagram in the (t2g)5
electron system has also been reported theoretically, fo-
cusing on the competition between the electron correla-
tions and the SOC [19]. It has been also predicted that
the carrier doping can induce unconventional supercon-
ductivities [20–23]

Recently, two experiments have reported interesting
observations for perovskite and post-perovskite 5d tran-
sition metal oxides, AOsO3 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) [24, 25]
and NaIrO3 [26], respectively, with a nominally (t2g)4
electron conﬁguration. At low temperatures, all these
materials except for SrOsO3 exhibit an insulating behav-
ior with no indication of magnetic order, despite that the
ﬁrst-principles calculations based on density functional
theory (DFT), including LDA(GGA)+SOC+U calcula-
tions, predict that these materials are all metallic [24, 26–
28].

When the SOC is signiﬁcantly large, i.e., in the jj
coupling limit, the j = 1/2 and 3/2 based bands are well
separated to simply become a relativistic band insulator

with the fully occupied j = 3/2 based bands and the
completely empty j = 1/2 based band. Indeed, Du et al.
has performed the LDA+Gutzwiller calculation, which
combines the DFT with the local density approximation
(LDA) and the Gutzwiller variational method, and con-
cluded that NaIrO3 is such a correlated paramagnetic
band insulator [27, 29].

On the other hand, when the electron correlations are
dominant, the LS coupling scheme in the atomic limit is
a better description. According to the Hund’s rule, the
ground state of a (t2g)4 electron system has the orbital
and spin angular momenta L = 1 and S = 1, respec-
tively, which couple via the SOC to form the total an-
gular momentum J = 0. Considering the hybridization
between neighbors, it is expected that the local singlets
with J = 0 form a band to become a Van Vleck-type
nonmagnetic insulator.
In this context, Khaliullin has
recently proposed a Van Vleck-type excitonic insulator,
where an excitonic condensation between the local J = 0
and J = 1 states is driven by the magnetic order through
the intersite exchange interaction [30].

The theoretical studies in the two extreme limits are
important to investigate possible exotic states. However,
it is highly desirable to examine the electronic ground
state as well as the excitations in a wider range of cou-
plings using a numerical technique which allows us to
treat the interplay between the electron correlations and
the SOC in a well controlled manner.

For this purpose, here we employ the multi-orbital dy-
namical mean ﬁeld theory (DMFT) [31] to study a three-
orbital Hubbard model with the SOC at four electrons
per site, corresponding to the (t2g)4 electronic conﬁgu-
ration. We demonstrate that the interplay between the
strong electron correlations and the SOC can stabilize the
Van Vleck-type nonmagnetic insulator and its magnetic
exciton condensation. Moreover, we ﬁnd in the moder-
ate electron correlation regime that the SOC can induce

a nonmagnetic excitonic insulator formed by an electron-
hole pair in the j = 1/2 and 3/2 based bands, as well as
the relativistic band insulator. The characteristic fea-
tures among these diﬀerent insulators are found in the
momentum resolved single-particle excitations.

set U = U ′ + 2Jz and Jz = Jxy = 0.15U [32]. The
electron correlations as well as ordered states are treated
by the multi-orbital DMFT on the Bethe lattice with
coordination number Z → ∞ [33, 34], where the DMFT
is exact. We consider the same bandwidth W for the
three orbitals (tγ = t/√Z), i.e., W = 4t, and t is used
as the energy unit. In the following, we show the results
for the lowest temperature T = 0.06, which essentially
represent the ground state.

ing a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC)
method based on the strong coupling expansion [35]. Al-
though the CTQMC calculation in principle enables us
to solve the model exactly, the negative sign problem is
one of the serious issues, particularly at low temperatures
for large SOC. Our previous study for (t2g)5 correlated
systems have demonstrated that the sign problem is im-
proved by transforming the t2g orbital bases (ciγσ) to
the maximally spin-orbit-entangled j bases (aijm) of the
eigenstates of H0 in the atomic limit, i.e.,

order parameters are also ﬁnite for all three j compo-

extends up to λ = 0.6.
It should also be noticed that
n3/2,1/2 6= n3/2,3/2 in the presence of a ﬁnite excitonic
order [38]. For λ ≥ 0.6, both magnetic and excitonic
orders disappear, and n3/2,1/2 = n3/2,3/2 (n1/2,1/2) in-
creases (decreases) towards two (zero) with further in-
creasing λ. In Fig. 1(c), we calculate the single-particle

iγσciδσ, and Ji = Si − Li. Since these
quantities do not depend on the site index i, we simply
omit this index hereafter. First, it is highly instructive
to consider four limiting cases. According to the Hund’s
rule, when the electron correlation is signiﬁcantly large
with no SOC, we expect that hS2i = hL2i = 2 and hJ2i =
4 because hL · Si = 0. If the SOC is introduced in this
limit, the spin and orbital angular momenta are aligned
antiparallel, and thus hS2i = hL2i = 2 and hJ2i = 0. This
is exactly the case for the ideal Van Vleck-type insulator.
In the limit of signiﬁcantly large SOC, where the ground
state is expected to be the relativistic band insulator,
hS2i = hL2i = 4
3 and hJ2i = 0. Finally, in the nonin-
teracting limit without the SOC, hS2i = 1.2, hL2i =
3.2, and hJ2i = 4.4.
Figure 2(a) shows the evolution of these quantities with
varying λ for U = 12. As expected in the strong elec-

3

tron correlation limit, we ﬁnd that hS2i = hL2i = 2
and hJ2i = 4 for λ = 0, in accordance with the Hund’s
rule. With increasing λ, hJ2i monotonically decreases
and eventually becomes zero for λ ≥ 0.6, where nei-
ther magnetic nor excitonic order exists, as shown in
In this region, hS2i and hL2i are still close
Fig. 1(a).
to two, specially near λ = 0.6, implying that the non-
magnetic insulator for λ ≥ 0.6 is the Van Vleck-type
insulator. However, we also notice that hS2i and hL2i
gradually decreases with further increasing λ, while hJ2i
is exactly zero, and we expect that hS2i and hL2i eventu-
ally become 4/3 in the limit of λ → ∞. Namely, the Van
Vleck-type insulator is smoothly connected to the simple
relativistic band insulator. On the other hand, we ﬁnd
in the region of 0 < λ < 0.6 that hJ2i > 0 while hS2i and
hL2i remain two. In this region, the magnetic and exci-
tonic orders are both ﬁnite, and therefore we attribute
this phase to the magnetic excitonic insulator with the
enhanced hybridization between the nonmagnetic J = 0
state and the magnetic J 6= 0 excited states.

Next, we examine a case with moderate U = 3. It is
noticed ﬁrst in Fig. 2(b) that hJ2i, hS2i, and hL2i for
λ = 0 are clearly depart from the noninteracting values,
implying that the electron correlations are indeed con-
sidered to be moderated, as it is expected for U ≈ W .
As shown in Fig. 1(b), we ﬁnd no magnetic order for all
values of λ. Aj,m(ω) exhibits sharp quasiparticle peaks
around the Fermi energy for both j = 1/2 and 3/2 when
λ < 1.2 [see Fig. 1(d)], and thus the ground state for
λ < 1.2 is metallic. However, the quasiparticle peaks dis-
appear with further increasing λ and the metal-insulator
transition occurs at λ ∼ 1.2, where the single-particle
excitation gap is open. More interestingly, in the inter-
mediate SOC region for 1.2 ≤ λ ≤ 1.4, we ﬁnd that
the excitonic insulator emerges without magnetic order
[see Fig. 1(b)]. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the degeneracy
of Aj=3/2,m(ω) for m = ±1/2 and ±3/2 is lifted in this
phase. With further increasing λ, the excitonic order
disappears for λ > 1.4 and the j = 3/2 based bands are
almost completely occupied with a ﬁnite excitation gap
to the unoccupied j = 1/2 based band [see Figs. 1(b)
and 1(d)]. This implies that the ground state for λ > 1.4
is the relativistic band insulator. In the noninteracting
limit, the SOC drives a transition from the metal to the
relativistic band insulator at λ = 4/3. Therefore, the
excitonic insulator found here is induced by the electron
correlations just before the overlap between the j = 1/2
and 3/2 based bands is diminished, where the condensa-
tion of an electron-hole pair in the j = 1/2 and 3/2 based
bands is most favorable with nonzero ∆

3/2,±1/2
1/2,±1/2.

Let us now discuss the diﬀerence between the two exci-
tonic insulators, i.e., the nonmagnetic excitonic insulator
for moderate U and the magnetic excitonic insulator for
large U . The former appears between the metal and the
relativistic band insulator, where an electron-hole pair in

The typical results of A(k, ω) are summarized in Fig. 3
for the four diﬀerent insulators. As shown in Fig. 3(a),
A(k, ω) for the relativistic band insulator in the moder-
ate correlation regime is very similar to the noninteract-
ing band structure for large λ and exhibits an indirect
gap between the j = 1/2 and 3/2 based bands. With
slightly decreasing the SOC, the ground state becomes
the nonmagnetic excitonic insulator and the typical re-
sult of A(k, ω) is shown in Fig. 3(b). This result clearly
demonstrates the strong hybridization between the bot-
tom of the j = 1/2 based conduction band and the top
of the j = 3/2 based valence bands to induce a ﬁnite
gap at the Fermi energy, and this is a strong evidence
for the excitonic insulator [see also Fig. 1(d)]. It is also
noticed in Fig. 3(b) that the spectrum is rather broad, as
compared with the one for the relativistic band insulator
shown in Fig. 3(a), despite that U is the same for both
cases.

Figure 3 (c) represents the result for the Van Vleck-
type insulator which appears in the strong correlation
regime. The apparent diﬀerence from the moderate cor-
relation regime is that the single-particle excitation gap
is determined by U and the spectrum is rather featureless
with a much broader structure specially in the unoccu-
pied states. The typical result for the magnetic exci-
tonic insulator is shown in Fig. 3(d). Similar to the Van
Vleck-type insulator, A(k, ω) exhibits a broad structure.
In addition, there exists a characteristic peak structure
near ω = 0 below the Fermi energy. The dispersion of
this excitation is strongly renormalized to become almost
ﬂat, implying the strong correlation eﬀects. As shown in
Fig. 1(c), this excitation originates mainly from the one
with the m = ±1/2 character of j = 3/2, the fourfold
degeneracy of j = 3/2 being lifted due to the magnetic
excitonic order.

In summary, we have studied the three-orbital Hub-
bard model with the SOC at four electrons per site by
using the multi-orbital DMFT and the CTQMC method.
For large U , we have demonstrated that the moderate
SOC induces the Van Vleck-type nonmagnetic insulator,
which is smoothly connected to the relativistic band in-
sulator for larger λ. We have also found in the strong
electron correlation regime that the magnetic excitonic
insulator is induced for small λ by hybridizing the non-
magnetic J = 0 singlet of the local (t2g)4 manifold and
the excited multiplets such as J = 1 triplets and J = 2
quintets. More interestingly, we have found in the mod-
erate electron correlation regime that the excitonic insu-
lator emerges without any magnetic order. This excitonic
insulator is due to the condensation of an electron-hole
pair in the j = 1/2 and 3/2 based bands. Although our
results for moderate U are most appropriate for 5d tran-
sition metal oxides, the results for large U should also be
relevant to 3d and 4d transition metal oxides with the low
spin conﬁguration. The diﬀerent insulators found here
are manifested most clearly in the momentum resolved

tion A(k, ω) for relativistic band insulator, (b) nonmagnetic

tor, and (d) magnetic excitonic insulator. The maximum of
each spectral function is normalized to be one. The Fermi
energy is denoted by horizontal lines at ω = 0.

the j = 1/2 and 3/2 based bands are condensed. There-
fore, the exciton condensation is similar to the conven-
tional one where a valence hole and a conduction electron
form a pair. In contrast, the other excitonic insulator ap-
pears in the strong coupling regime where U alone can
open the single-particle excitation gap without magnetic
order (see Fig. 1 for λ = 0). As shown in Fig. 2(a),
in this strong coupling regime, the LS coupling scheme
is a better description and thus the excitonic insulator
here, accompanying the magnetic order, is considered as
the Van Vleck-type excitonic insulator induced by mixing
the nonmagnetic J = 0 state and the magnetic J = 1 and
J = 2 excited states. This is simply because hJ2i > 2
is possible only when the J = 2 state is involved.
In-
deed, we can readily show that the ﬁnite order param-
3/2,±1/2
1/2,±1/2 generates the mixing between the J = 0
eter ∆
singlet and the J = 2 quintets in addition to the J = 1
triplets. Therefore, this magnetic excitonic insulator is
similar to the one proposed by Khaliullin [30] except for
the involvement of the J = 2 quintets.

[36] The imaginary unit i in the transformation matrix should
not be confused with the site index i in the annihilation
operators.

[37] Since our model is isotropic, the magnetic orders along
the other x and y directions are identical to that along
the z direction.

[38] This is also the case in another excitonic insulating phase

for U = 3.
