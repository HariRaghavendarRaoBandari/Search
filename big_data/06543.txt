ON THE CO-ORBITAL MOTION IN THE

PLANAR RESTRICTED THREE-BODY PROBLEM:

THE QUASI-SATELLITE MOTION REVISITED

ALEXANDRE POUSSE, PHILIPPE ROBUTEL, AND ALAIN VIENNE

Abstract. In the framework of the planar and circular Restricted Three-Body Problem,
we consider an asteroid that orbits the Sun in quasi-satellite motion with a planet. A
quasi-satellite trajectory is a heliocentric orbit in co-orbital resonance with the planet,
characterized by a non zero eccentricity and a resonant angle that librates around zero.
Likewise, in the rotating frame with the planet it describes the same trajectory as the
one of a retrograde satellite even though the planet acts as a perturbator.
In the last few years, the discoveries of asteroids in this type of motion made the term
“quasi-satellite” more and more present in the literature. However, some authors rather
use the term “retrograde satellite” when referring to this kind of motion in the studies of
the restricted problem in the rotating frame.
In this paper we intend to clarify the terminology to use, in order to bridge the gap
between the perturbative co-orbital point of view and the more general approach in the
rotating frame. Through a numerical exploration of the co-orbital phase space, we describe
the quasi-satellite domain and highlight that it is not reachable by low eccentricities by
averaging process. We will show that the quasi-satellite domain is eﬀectively included in
the domain of the retrograde satellites and neatly deﬁned in terms of frequencies.
Eventually, we highlight a remarkable high eccentric quasi-satellite orbit corresponding
to a frozen ellipse in the heliocentric frame. We extend this result to the eccentric case
(planet on an eccentric motion) and show that two families of frozen ellipses originate
from this remarkable orbit.

1. Introduction

Following the discoveries, in 1899 and 1908, of the retrograde moons Phoebe and Pasiphea
moving at great distances from their respective primaries Saturn and Jupiter, Jackson
(1913) published the ﬁrst study dedicated to the motion of the retrograde satellites (RS).
Seeking to understand how a moon could still be satellized at this remote distance (close
to the limit of the planet Hill’s sphere), he highlighted in the Sun-Jupiter system that

THE QUASI-SATELLITE MOTION REVISITED

where “[...] the solar forces would prohibited direct motion, [...] the solar and the Jovian
forces would go hand in hand to maintain a retrograde satellites”. Thus, by this remark
the author was the ﬁrst to conﬁrm the existence and stability of remote retrograde satellite
objects in the solar system. Afterwards, the existence and stability of some retrograde
satellite orbits far from the secondary body have also been established in the planar Re-
stricted Three-Body Problem (RTBP) with two equal masses (Str¨omgren, 1933; Moeller,
1935; Henon, 1965a,b)1 and in the Earth-Moon system (Broucke, 1968).

In the framework of the Hill’s approximation, Henon (1969) extended Jackson’s study
and highlighted that there exists a one-parameter family of stable retrograde satellite pe-
riodic orbits (denoted family f ) that could exists beyond the Eulerian conﬁgurations L1
and L2. This has been conﬁrm in Henon and Guyot (1970) in the Restricted Three-Body
Problem. The authors showed in the rotating frame with the planet (RF), that the fam-
ily f extends from the retrograde satellite orbits in an inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of the
secondary to the collision orbit with the primary. Besides, they pointed out that if ε, the
ratio of the secondary mass over the sum of the system masses, is less than 0.0477, the
whole family is stable. Benest (1974, 1975, 1976) extended these results by studying the
stability of the neighbourhood of the family f in the conﬁguration space for 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1.
After these theoretical works, the study of the retrograde satellite orbits was addressed
in a more practical point of view, with the project to inject a spacecraft in a circum-Phobos
orbit. Remark that as the Phobos Hill’s sphere is too close to its surface, remote retrograde
satellites are particularly adapted trajectories. Hence, at the end of the eighties, the
terminology “Quasi-satellite”2 (QS) appeared in the USSR astrodynamicist community to
deﬁne trajectories in the Restricted Three-Body Problem in rotating frame that correspond
to retrograde satellite orbits outside the Hill’s sphere of the secondary body (see Fig.1a).
The Phobos mission study led to the works of Kogan (1990) and Lidov and Vashkov’yak
(1993, 1994a,b).

At the end of the nineties, the quasi-satellite motion appeared in the celestial mechanics
community in the view of asteroid trajectories in the solar system. Let us suppose a
QS-type asteroid far enough from the planet so that the inﬂuence of the Sun dominates
its movement and therefore that the planet acts as a perturbator. Then, its trajectory
could be represented by heliocentric osculating ellipses whose variations are governed by
the inﬂuence of the planet. In this context, Mikkola and Innanen (1997) remarked that
the asteroid and the planet are in 1 : 1 mean motion resonance and therefore that the
quasi-satellite orbits correspond to a particular kind of conﬁgurations in the co-orbital
resonance. Unlike the tadpole (TP) orbits that librate around the Lagrangian equilibria
L4 and L5 or the horseshoes (HS) that encompass L3, L4 and L5, the quasi-satellite orbits

1 The two ﬁrsts are works of the Copenhagen group that extensively explored periodic orbit solutions
in the planar Restricted Three-Body Problem with two equal masses. The two lasts are the ﬁrst numerical
explorations of all the solutions of the Restricted Three-Body Problem that recovered and completed the
precedent works.

2 Let us still mention that the “quasi-satellite” terminology has already been used in the paper of
Danielsson and Ip (1972) but this was to describe the resonant behaviour of the near-Earth Object 1685
Toro and therefore was completely disconnected to retrograde satellite motion.

are characterized by a resonant angle θ = λ − λ′ that librates around zero (where λ and λ′
are the mean longitudes of the asteroid and the planet) and a non zero eccentricity if the
planet gravitates on a circle (see Fig.1b). In their paper, these authors also described a
ﬁrst perturbative treatment to study the long term stability of quasi-satellites in the solar
system. At that time no natural object was known to orbit this conﬁguration. However,
they suggested that, at least, the Earth and Venus could have quasi-satellite companions.
Following this work, Wiegert et al. (2000) also predicted, via a numerical investigation of
the stability around the giant planets, that Uranus and Neptune could harbour QS-type
asteroids whereas they did not found stable solutions for Jupiter and Saturn. Subsequently,
Namouni (1999) and Namouni et al. (1999) became the reference in term of co-orbital
dynamics with close encounters. Using Hill’s approximation, these authors highlighted
that in the spatial case, transitions between horseshoe and quasi-satellite trajectories could
occurred. They exhibited new kinds of compound trajectories denoted HS-QS, TP-QS or
TP-QS-TP which means that there exists stable transitions exit between quasi-satellite,
tadpole and horseshoe orbits. Later, Nesvorn´y et al. (2002) recovered these new co-orbital
structures in a global study of the co-orbital resonance phase space. By developing a
perturbative scheme using numerical averaging techniques, they showed how the tadpole,
horseshoe, quasi-satellite and compound orbits vary with the asteroid eccentricity and
inclination in the planar-circular, planar-eccentric and spatial-circular models. Particularly,
they showed that the higher the asteroid’s eccentricity is, the larger the domain occupied
by the quasi-satellite orbits in the phase space is. Eventually, the quasi-satellite long-
term stability has been studied using perturbation theory in Mikkola et al. (2006) and
Sidorenko et al. (2014). The ﬁrst ones developed a practical algorithm to detect QS-type
asteroids on temporary or perpetual regime, while the last ones established conditions of
existence of quasi-satellite motion and also explore its diﬀerent possible regimes.

4

THE QUASI-SATELLITE MOTION REVISITED

Following these theoretical works, many objects susceptible to be at least temporary
quasi-satellites have been found in the solar system. The ﬁrst conﬁrmed minor body
was 2002 VE68 in co-orbital motion with Venus in Mikkola et al. (2004). The Earth
(Brasser et al., 2004; Connors et al., 2002, 2004; de la Fuente Marcos and de la Fuente Marcos,
2014; Wajer, 2009, 2010) and Jupiter (Kinoshita and Nakai, 2007; Wajer and Kr´olikowska,
2012) are the two planets with the largest number of documented QS-type objects. Like-
wise, Saturn (Gallardo, 2006), Uranus (Gallardo, 2006; de la Fuente Marcos and de la Fuente Marcos,
2014), Neptune (de la Fuente Marcos and de la Fuente Marcos, 2012) possess at least one
of this type.

At last, let us mention that quasi-satellite motion could play a role in other celestial
problems: according to Kortenkamp (2005) and (2013), planetesimals could be trapped
in quasi-satellite motion around the protoplanet as well as interplanetary dust particles
around Earth. Eventually, although no co-orbital exoplanet system has been found, sev-
eral studies on the planetary Three-Body Problem (TBP) showed the existence and the
stability of two co-orbital planets in quasi-satellite motion (Hadjidemetriou et al., 2009;
Hadjidemetriou and Voyatzis, 2011; Giuppone et al., 2010).

During these last twenty years, even though the “quasi-satellite” terminology becomes
dominant in the literature, some studies use rather “retrograde satellite” (Namouni, 1999;
Nesvorn´y et al., 2002) in reference to the neighbourhood of the family f in the restricted
problem in rotating frame. Hence, there exists an ambiguity in terms of terminology that is
a consequence of the several approaches to describe these orbits, depending on the distance
between the two co-orbitals. One of our purposes is thus to clarify the terminology to use
between “quasi-satellite” and “retrograde satellite”. Then, we chose to revisit the classical
works on the family f (Henon and Guyot, 1970; Benest, 1974) in the section 4 and through
a study on its frequencies, we show that the neighbourhood of the family is split in three
diﬀerent domains connected by an orbit; one corresponding to the “satellized” retrograde
satellite orbits while the two others to the quasi-satellites. Among these two quasi-satellite
domains, we identify one that is associated with asteroid trajectories in the solar system.
This is on this last one that the paper is focussed.

An usual approach for these co-orbital trajectories in the restricted (Mikkola et al., 2006;
Nesvorn´y et al., 2002; Sidorenko et al., 2014) and planetary (Robutel and Pousse, 2013)
problems consists on averaging the Hamiltonian over the fast angle of the system (the
planet mean longitude) to reduce the study of the problem to its semi-fast and secular
components. This approach is generally denoted as the averaged problem (AP). However,
as mentioned in Robutel and Pousse (2013) and Robutel et al. (2015), this one has the
important drawback to reﬂect poorly the dynamics close to the singularity associated with
the collision with the planet. Some quasi-satellite trajectories having close encounter with
the planet, these are located close to the singularity in the averaged problem which implies
that this approach would not be appropriate for them. Thus, in order to estimate a validity
limit of the averaged problem for the study of quasi-satellite motion, we also revisit the
co-orbital resonance via the averaged problem.

Firstly, in the section 2, we develop the Hamiltonian formalism of the problem and
introduce the averaged problem. Subsequently, in the section 3, we focus on the circular

THE QUASI-SATELLITE MOTION REVISITED

case that allows possible reduction. We introduce the reduced averaged problem (RAP)
that seems to be the most adapted approach to understand the dynamics in the co-orbital
resonance. Focussing on quasi-satellite motion, we exhibit a family of ﬁxed points in the
reduced averaged problem representing the family f that allows us to estimates the validity
limit of the averaged problem.

Next, to bridge a gap between the averaged problem and the works of Henon and Guyot
(1970) and Benest (1975), we devote the section 4 to revisit the motion in the rotating
frame in the circular case in order to describe the family f as well as its reachable part in
the averaged problem and characterize its neighbourhood. Through this study, we show
how the quasi-satellite domain reachable in the averaged problem shrinks by increasing ε.
At last, in the section 5, we come back to the averaged problem with the aim to extend
in the eccentric case (i.e. planet on an eccentric orbit) a result on co-orbital frozen orbits
that has been highlighted in section 3.4.

2. The averaged problem

In the framework of the planar RTBP, we consider a primary with a mass 1 − ε (the
Sun or a star), a secondary (a planet) with a mass ε small with respect to 1 and a massless
third body (particle or asteroid). We assume that the planet is in elliptic Keplerian motion
whose eccentricity is denoted e′. Without loss of generality, we set that its semi-major axis
is equal to 1 and that the argument of its periaster is equal to zero. In an heliocentric
frame, the Hamiltonian of the problem reads

H(r, ˙r, t) = H0(r, ˙r) + εH1(r, ˙r, t)

In this expression, r is the heliocentric position of the particle, ˙r its conjugated variable and
r′(t) is the position of the planet at the time t. In order to deﬁne a canonical coordinate
system related to the elliptic elements (a, e, λ, ω) (respectively semi-major axis, eccentricity,
mean longitude and argument of the periaster), we start from Poincar´e’s variables in com-

plex form (λ, Λ, x,−ix) where Λ = √a, Γ = Λ(1 − √1 − e2) and x = √Γ exp(iω). In order

to work with an autonomous Hamiltonian, we extend the phase space by introducing Λ′,
the conjugated variable of λ′ = n′t, n′ being the planet’s mean motion. As a consequence
the Hamiltonian becomes, on the extended phase space, equal to H + n′Λ′. Focussing on
the co-orbital resonance, we introduce the new canonical coordinates (θ, u, x,−ix, λ′, ˜Λ′)
where

θ = λ − λ′

(3)

that maps the coordinate system (θ, u, x,−ix, λ′, ˜Λ′) to (r, ˙r, λ′, Λ′) will be denoted by φ.

THE QUASI-SATELLITE MOTION REVISITED

As inside the co-orbital resonance, the angle θ varies slowly with respect to the planet
mean longitude, we chose to average the Hamiltonian over the fast angle λ′ to reduce the
dimension of the problem. The averaged Hamiltonian will be denoted H.

2.1. The averaged Hamiltonian. According to the perturbation theory, there exists a
canonical transformation C, close to the identity, such that
(4)

(n′Λ′ + H) ◦ φ ◦ C = n′ ˜Λ′ + H + O(ε2).

In the averaged variables deﬁned as

H reads:

If {f, g} represents the Poisson bracket of the two functions f and g and if y stands for
one of the variables (θ, u, x,−ix, λ′, ˜Λ′), the two coordinate systems are related by
(8)

y = y. + ε{W, y.} + O(ε2) with W =

Thus, the averaged Hamiltonian H processes two degrees of freedom and depends on
one parameter, the planetary eccentricity e′. For the sake of clarity, the “ underdot ” used
to denote the averaged coordinates will be omitted.

2.2. Numerical averaging. There exists at least two classical averaging techniques adapted
to the co-orbital resonance: an analytical one based on an expansion of the Hamiltonian in
power series of the eccentricity (e.g. Morais, 2001; Robutel and Pousse, 2013), and a numer-
ical one consisting on a numerical evaluation of H and its derivatives (e.g. Nesvorn´y et al.,
2002; Giuppone et al., 2010; Beaug´e and Roig, 2001; Mikkola et al., 2006; Sidorenko et al.,
2014). Whereas for low eccentricities the analytical technique is very eﬃcient, reaching
higher values of eccentricity requires high order expansions which generate very heavy ex-
pressions. Thus, in this case, the use of numerical methods may be more convenient. Then
in order to explore the phase space of the co-orbital resonance for all eccentricities lower
than one, we use the numerical averaging method developed by Nesvorn´y et al. (2002).

This method consists on a numerical evaluation of the integral (7). More generally, let
F be a generic function depending on (θ, u, x,−ix, E, E ′) where E and E ′ are the eccentric
anomaly of the particle and the planet. As its average over the mean longitude λ′ is
computed for a given ﬁxed value of θ, we have dλ′ = dλ = (1 − e cos E)dE. As
(9)

θ = λ − λ′ = E + ω − E ′ − e sin E + e′ sin E ′,

THE QUASI-SATELLITE MOTION REVISITED

the eccentric anomalies E ′ can be expressed in terms of (θ, E, ω, e, e′). Eventually, the
integrals reads

(10)

F (θ, u, x,−ix) =

1

F (θ, u, x,−ix, E, E ′(θ, E, ω, e, e′))(1 − e cos E)dE,

which can be computed by discretizing the variable E as Ek = k2π
(see Nesvorn´y et al., 2002, for more details).

3. The co-orbital resonance in the circular case (e′ = 0)

In the circular case, the “averaged problem” (AP) – deﬁned by H – being invariant
under the action of the symmetry group SO(2) associated with the rotations around the
vertical axis, we have

(11)

∂H
∂ω

(θ, u, x,−ix) = 0 = ˙xx + x ˙x = ˙Γ,

which imposes Γ to be a ﬁrst integral. As a consequence, in the averaged problem, the
two degrees of freedom of the problem are separable and a reduction is possible. Thus,
by ﬁxing the value of the parameter Γ and eliminating the cyclic variable ω, we suppress
one degree of freedom. We call this new problem the “reduced averaged problem” (RAP).
However, instead of using the parameter Γ, it is more convenient to introduce the quantity

e0 := p1 − (1 − Γ)2, which is equal to e for u = 0.
3.1. The reduced Hamiltonian. For a ﬁxed value e0 = ζ such that 0 ≤ ζ < 1, let
us deﬁne M e0 the intersection of the phase space of the averaged problem denoted M
with the hyperplane {e0 = ζ}, and M e0/SO(2), the quotient space of this section by the
symmetry group SO(2). Under the action of the application
: M e0 → M e0/SO(2)

(12)

ψe0

(θ, u, ω)

7→

(θ, u),

the problem is reduced to one degree of freedom and is associated with the reduced Hamil-
tonian H e0 := H(·,·, Γ(e0)). Thus, for a ﬁxed e0, a trajectory in the RAP is generally
a periodic orbit, but can also be a ﬁxed point. As a consequence, the description of the
RAP’s phase portrait obtained for various values of e0 allows to understand the global
dynamics of the co-orbital resonance for e′ = 0. The AP being more usual to illustrate
the semi-fast and secular variations of the orbital elements and the rotating frame (RF)
more classic to understand the dynamics of the RTBP, we will see in the next section how
a given orbit is represented in these three diﬀerent points of view.

3.2. Correspondence between the RAP, the AP and the RF. Let us consider,
a periodic trajectory of frequency ν in the RAP. Its frequency being of order √ε (see
Mikkola et al., 2006), then it is associated with the semi-fast component of the dynamics.
The correspondence between the RAP and the AP consists in the pullback of a trajectory
e0 . However, ω being ignorable in the RAP,
is not an injection, which implies that a family of orbits in the AP parametrized by

ω(0) ∈ [0, 2π] is mapped by ψe0 to the initial trajectory. For each orbits of the family, the

is the secular precession frequency of ω. As a consequence, a given periodic trajectory in
the RAP generally corresponds, in the AP, to a family of quasi-periodic orbits of frequencies
ν and g. Nevertheless, let us mention that when the osculating ellipses are circles (e0 = 0),
ω being ignorable, the trajectories are ﬁxed points or periodic orbits of frequency ν in both
approaches. Likewise when e0 > 0 and g = 0, a periodic trajectory of the RAP provides
a family of periodic orbits of frequency ν in the AP while a ﬁxed point corresponds to a
family of degenerated ﬁxed points.

Next, to connect the AP with the RF, we ﬁrstly have to apply C to the trajectory (i.e.
inverse the equation (5)) which adds the fast frequency in the variations of the orbital
elements, i.e. the planet mean motion n′. In the circular case, the d’Alembert rule implies
that (n′Λ′ + H) ◦ φ only depends on the angles λ′ − ω and θ. Consequently, by deﬁning
the canonical transformation

with M , the non-averaged phase space, ζ = √Γ exp(iϕ), and ϕ = λ′ − ω, the Hamiltonian
(n′Λ′ + H) ◦ φ ◦ χ−1 becomes autonomous with two degrees of freedom associated with
the frequencies ν and n′ − g. Moreover, this Hamiltonian is related to those in the RF
by the pullback by φ−1, that is the canonical transformation in Cartesian coordinates.
Thus, a trajectory in the RF is generally quasi-periodic with two frequencies. As a conse-
quence, a given trajectory of the RAP generally corresponds to a family of orbits in the
RF parametrized by ϕ(0) ∈ [0, 2π] with one more frequency.

For the sake of clarity, we summarize the status of the remarkable orbits in the three

3.3. Phase portraits of the RAP. The ﬁgure 2 displays the phase portraits of the
RAP associated with six diﬀerent values of the parameter e0 for a Sun-Jupiter like system
(ε = 0.001).

In Fig.2a, e0 is equal to zero: the osculating ellipses of all the orbits are circles. The
singular point located at θ = u = 0 corresponds to the collision between the asteroid
and the planet, where H is not deﬁned (the integral (7) is divergent). The two elliptic
ﬁxed points, in (θ, u) = (±60˚, 0), correspond to the Lagrangian conﬁgurations L4 and
L5 whereas the hyperbolic ﬁxed point, close to (θ, u) = (180˚, 0), is associated with the
Eulerian conﬁguration L3. On the phase portraits described by Nesvorn´y et al. (2002)
two additional equilibria appears: the Eulerian conﬁgurations L1 and L2. But as it has

been shown in Robutel and Pousse (2013), there exists a neighbourhood of the collision
singularity inside which the averaged Hamiltonian does not reﬂect properly the dynamics
of the “initial” problem. Indeed, a remainder which depends on the fast variable and that
is supposed to be small with respect to ε ¯H1 (see the expressions (4) to (7)) is generated by
the averaging process. Although it is the case in the major part of the phase space, when
the distance to the collision is of order ε1/3 and less, the remainder is at least of the same
order than the perturbation ε ¯H1 (Robutel et al., 2015). Thus, this deﬁne an “exclusion
zone” inside which the trajectories, and especially the equilibria L1 and L2, fall outside
the scope of the averaged Hamiltonian.

The orbits that librate around L4 or L5 lying inside the separatrix originating from L3
correspond to the tadpoles (TP) orbits. For e0 = 0, these two domains form two families
of periodic orbits originating in L4 and L5 and that are parametrized by u ≥ 0. We denote
L4 and N u
them N u
L5. More precisely, they are the Lyapounov families of the Lagrangian
equilateral conﬁgurations associated with the libration and generally known as the long
period families L l
5 in the RF (see Meyer and Hall, 1992). Eventually, outside the
separatrix lies the horseshoe (HS) domain: the orbits that encompass the three equilibria
L3, L4 and L5.

4 and L l

If, when e0 = 0, the domain of deﬁnition of H e0 excludes the origin θ = u = 0, the
location of its singularities (associated with the collision) evolves with the parameter e0.
Indeed, as soon as e0 > 0, the origin becomes a regular point while the set of singular
points describes a curve that surrounds the origin. The phase space is now divided in two
diﬀerent domains.

For small e0 (for example e0 = 0.25 represented in Fig.2b), the domain outside the
collision curve has the same topology as for e0 = 0: two stable equilibria close to the L4
and L5’s location and a separatrix emerging from an hyperbolic ﬁxed point close to L3 that
bounds the TP and the HS domains. However, contrarily to e0 = 0, the ﬁxed points do not
correspond to equilibria in the AP and the RF but to periodic orbits. Consequently, orbits

Figure 3. Representation of the co-orbital families of periodic orbits from
the three diﬀerent points of view. From each Lagrangian triangular equilib-
rium originates two Lyapounov families that correspond to a periodic orbit
family and a ﬁxed point family in the RAP. These families are associated
with the long and short period families in the AP and the RF. L3 being a
saddle center type in the RAP, only one Lyapounov family emanates from
this equilibrium that is a ﬁxed point family in the RAP and a periodic orbit
family in the AP and RF. Eventually, for e0 > 0, there exists a family of
ﬁxed points in the RAP that is not a Lyapounov family: Ge0
QS. This family
is associated with a periodic orbit family in the RF: the family f .

the collision curve appears a new domain containing orbits that librate around a ﬁxed point
of coordinates close to the origin: the QS domain. By varying e0, the ﬁxed points form a
one-parameter family that originates from the singular point for e0 = 0. We denote it Ge0
QS.
In the RF, these ﬁxed points correspond to a family of periodic orbits with a frequency
n′ − g and such that θ = 0˚. Hence, Ge0
Thus for small eccentricities, TP, HS and QS domains are structured around two pe-
riodic orbit families and four ﬁxed point families that we outline in Fig.3 to clarify their
representations in the diﬀerent approaches.

QS is related to the family f .

For higher values of e0 (cf. Fig.2c, d, e and f), the topology of the phase portraits
does not change inside the collision curve: the QS domain is always present, but its size
increases until it dominates the phase portrait for high eccentricity values. Outside the
collision curve, the situation is diﬀerent. As e0 increases, the two stable equilibria get closer
to the hyperbolic ﬁxed point, which implies that the TP domains shrink and vanish when
the three merge. This bifurcation generates a new domain inside which orbits that librate
around the ﬁxed point close to (θ, u) = (180˚, 0) (cf. Fig.2f). A similar result was found

the RF, the authors showed that the short period families L s
5 terminate on a
periodic orbit of L3 (see the outline in Fig.4).

4 and L s

Now, let us focus on the QS domain. As mentioned above, there exists an exclusion
zone in the vicinity of the collision curve such that the QS orbits does not represent “real”
trajectories of the initial problem. For high eccentricities, the QS dominates the phase
portraits; the size of the intersection between the QS domain and the exclusion zone is
small relatively to the whole domain. However by decreasing e0, the QS domain shrinks
with the collision curve. As a consequence, the relative size of the intersection increases
until a critical value of e0 where the exclusion zone contains all the QS orbits. In this case,
the AP and a fortiori the RAP are not relevant to study the QS motion.

A simple way to estimate a validity limit of theses two approaches is to consider that
the whole QS domain is excluded if and only if Ge0
QS is inside the exclusion zone. Thus
the study of the ﬁxed points family Ge0
QS allows to determinate the eccentricity value under
which the averaging method cannot be applied to QS motion. This method is implemented
in the following section.

3.4. Fixed point families of the RAP. The stability of the ﬁxed point belonging to the
Ge0
QS family is deduced from the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of H e0. When the ﬁxed
point is elliptic, its eigenvalues are equal to ±iν, where the real number ν is the rotation
frequency around the equilibrium. Moreover, the precession frequency of the corresponding
orbit is given by g = − ∂

ε = 10−3 (a Sun-Jupiter like system).

The evolution of the location and of the frequencies of the orbits associated with the
L5 versus e0 are described in Fig.5 for a mass ratio equal to

order or higher than the fast frequency, Ge0
QS enters the exclusion zone and the averaged
problem does not describe accurately the quasi-satellite’s motions.

QS is outside the exclusion zone when |g| and |ν| are lower than
n′/4. Fig.5 shows that this quantity is given by e0 = 0.18 (vertical dashed line). Therefore,
the AP and RAP are relevant to study Ge0
QS and thus the QS motion for e0 ≥ 0.18 in the
Sun-Jupiter system.
Now, we focus on the variations of g along each families of ﬁxed points. For each of
them, the frequency is monotonous and crosses zero for a critical value of eccentricity:
e0 ≃ 0.8352 for Ge0

to the section 3.2, these particular trajectories in the RAP correspond to circles of ﬁxed
points in the AP, and periodic orbits of frequency n′ in the RF, that is frozen ellipses in

To conclude this section, we connect the ﬁxed points families in the RAP to the cor-
responding trajectory in the RF. Outside the exclusion zone, the transformation of these
ones by φ ◦ χ ◦ C ◦ ψ−1
e0 provides us a ﬁrst order approximation of their initial conditions in
the RF. Therefore, by improving them with an iterative algorithm that removes the fre-
quency ν (Couetdic et al., 2010), we integrated the corresponding trajectories in the RF.

4. Quasi-satellite’s domains in the rotating frame with the planet

4.1. The family f in the RF. The RAP seems to be the most adapted approach to
understand the co-orbital motion in the circular case. However, the averaged approaches
have the drawback to be poorly signiﬁcant in the exclusion zone that surround the singu-
larity. For the QS motion, we showed in the section 3 that the whole domain could not
be reachable by low eccentric orbits, that is when the trajectories get closer to the planet.
As a consequence, to understand the QS nearby the planet and connect our results in
the averaged approaches, we chose to revisit the classical works (Henon and Guyot, 1970;
Benest, 1975) on the family f in the RF.

In the RF with the planet on a circular orbit, the problem has two degrees of freedom
that we represent by the position r = (ξ, η) and the velocity ˙r = ( ˙ξ, ˙η) in the frame whose
origin is the planet position, the horizontal axis is the Sun-planet alignment and the vertical
axis, its perpendicular (see Fig.7).

In the neighbourhood of the family f , each trajectory crosses the axes {η = 0} with
˙η < 0 when ξ > 0. By deﬁning the Poincar´e map ΠT associated with this section, the
problem could be reduced to one degree of freedom represented by (ξ, ˙ξ), T being the
time between two consecutive crossings. Thus, in this Poincar´e section a periodic orbit
of the family f corresponds to a ﬁxed point whose coordinates in the RF are (ξ, 0, 0, ˙η)
with T = 2π/(n′ − g). The stability of the periodic orbit is deduced from the trace of the
monodromy matrix dΠT evaluated at the ﬁxed point. Moreover, when the ﬁxed point is
stable, the libration frequency ν is obtained from its two conjugated eigenvalues (κ, κ) such
as κ = exp iνT .

4.2. Application to a Sun-Jupiter like system. The ﬁgure 8 and 9a represent the
family f in the (ξ, ˙η) plane (red curve) and its reachable part in the averaged approaches
(sky blue curve).

Fig.8 shows that the family f extends from the orbits in an inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood
of the planet to the collision orbit with the Sun. Although, the whole family is linearly

stable, we cannot predict the size of the stable region surrounding it. Indeed, resonances
with its normal frequencies could reduced this region. This is what occurs in two points of
the family f (blue crosses and dashed lines) where the stability domain’s diameter tends
to zero. Consequently, these two periodic orbits divide the neighbourhood of the family f
in three connected domains that we outlined in grey in Fig.8 and Fig.9a.

The ﬁgure 9b exhibits the variations of the frequencies ν and n′ − g along the family.
Comparing to Fig.5b, we remark that ν/n′ does not tend to inﬁnity when the periodic
orbits get closer to the planet, but increases and tends to 1. Likewise, Fig.9b highlights
that the resonance between the frequencies of the system is ν/(n′ − g) = 1/3 and that the
three domains are neatly deﬁned in terms of frequencies as follows:

(16)

RS : (cid:26) 3ν < n′ − g

|g| > n′

, QSb :

3ν > n′ − g
and QSh : (cid:26) 3ν < n′ − g

|g| < n′

.

The upper bound of the closest domain to the planet being the L2 position, that is the limit
of the Hill’s sphere, then this one corresponds to the “satellized” retrograde satellite (RS)
orbits. This domain consists of trajectories dominated by the gravitational inﬂuence of the
planet whereas the star acts as a perturbator. Thus the planetocentric osculating ellipses
are the most relevant variables to represent the motion and perturbative treatments are
possible. The domain outside the Hill’s sphere corresponds to the QS that is divided in
two others domains.

The domain of QSh orbits , that is the heliocentric QS, corresponds to the farthest
domain to the planet, which implies that this body acts as a perturbator whereas the
inﬂuence of the star dominates the dynamics. Therefore, the heliocentric orbital elements

are well suited to the problem, and the perturbative treatment as well as the averaging over
the fast angle are natural. As a consequence, it is the QSh trajectories that are reachable
in the averaged problem. As the orbits of the family f included in the QSh domain cross
the Poincar´e section at their aphelion, the ξ coordinates is related to e0 by the expression
ξ = e = e0 + O(ε).
The third domain, that we called the binary QS domain (QSb ), is intermediate between

inﬂuence on the massless one. As a consequence, the frequencies n′ and g could be of the
same order or even equal, making inappropriate any method of averaging.

Remark that in the planetary problem, Hadjidemetriou and Voyatzis (2011) highlight a
family of periodic orbits that corresponds to the family f . Indeed, along this family that
ranges from orbits for which the two planets collide with the star to the orbits where the
two planets are mutually satellized, all trajectories are stable and satisfy θ = 0˚. These
authors also decomposed the family in three domains, denoted A, B and planetary, which
seem to correspond to our RS, QSb and QSh domains.

4.3. Extension to arbitrary masses. By varying the mass ratio ε, we follow the evolu-
tion of the boundaries of the three domains along the family f as well as the validity limit of
the averaged problem. In Fig.10, the parameter ε ranges from 10−7 to 0.0477 which is the
critical mass ratio where a part of the family f becomes unstable (see Henon and Guyot,
1970). For Sun-terrestrial planet systems, the size of the QSb and RS domains is negligible
with respect to the QSh one. As a consequence, for these systems, the AP and RAP are
fully adapted to describe the main part of the family f and its neighbourhood (except
for very small eccentricities). For Sun-giant planet systems as well as the Earth-Moon
system, the gravitational inﬂuence of the planet being stronger, the size of the QSb domain
f increases until to be of the same order than those of the RS one while the size of the
QSh decreases. As e0 = ξ + O(ε), we established that for the Sun-Uranus, Sun-Saturn,
Sun-Jupiter and Earth-Moon systems, the QSh orbits are reachable in the averaged prob-
lem by e0 greater than 0.08, 0.13, 0.18 and 0.5. Then, by increasing ε, the QSb domain
becomes dominant while the QSh one is reduced so much that the averaged problem be-
comes useless for all values of e0 (ε ≃ 0.04). Consequently, for the Pluto-Charon system
(ε ≃ 1/10) none QSh trajectory could be described in the averaged approaches. Moreover,
according to the stability map of the family f in Benest (1975), this system could not
harbour a QSh companion: only QSb and RS trajectories exist for this value of mass ratio.

5. On the frozen orbits: an extension to the eccentric case (e′ > 0)

An important result of our study in the circular case has been to highlight the particular
orbits GQS, GL3 , GL4 and GL5, circles of ﬁxed points in the averaged problem that corre-
spond to frozen ellipses in the heliocentric frame (see the section 3.4). A natural question is
to know if these structures are preserved when a small eccentricity is given to the planetary
orbit. This question can be addressed in a perturbative way. Indeed, for suﬃciently low
= H + e′R, i.e. the
values of planet’s eccentricity, the Hamiltonian of the problem reads H

mension of the phase space could not been reduced as in the section 3 and the persistence
of ﬁxed points is not necessary guaranteed.

In the present paper, we limit our approach to numerical explorations of the phase
space. For a very low value of e′ in a Sun-Jupiter like system, numerical simulations show

is unstable. Thus, we also characterized the stability of the family by varying e′. Their

L4,1 is stable whereas Ge′

L4,2 is unstable.

Let us notice that these two families have been highlighted in the planetary problem.
Indeed, these two families have certainly to do with the stable and unstable families of pe-
riodic orbits described in Hadjidemetriou et al. (2009) and Hadjidemetriou and Voyatzis
(2011). As regard Ge′
QS,1, it could also be associated with the QS ﬁxed point family in
Giuppone et al. (2010). In Giuppone et al. (2010) as well as in Hadjidemetriou and Voyatzis
(2011), these authors remarked that the conﬁguration described by Ge′
QS,1 with two equal
eccentricities exists with an eccentricity value close to 0.565 for several planetary mass
ratio.
In our study, we establish that this particular orbit also exists in the RTBP for
e = e′ ≃ 0.565 (see Fig.11). Likewise, according to Hadjidemetriou et al. (2009), the con-
ﬁguration described by Ge′
L3,1 with two equal eccentricities seems to exist in the planetary
problem for an eccentricity value close to 0.73. Consequently, this suggests that these two
particular conﬁgurations are weakly dependent on the ratio of the planetary masses.

Eventually, we remark that the existence of some of these eight conﬁgurations has already
been showed. Indeed, in the range 0.01 ≤ e′ ≤ 0.5, Nesvorn´y et al. (2002) exhibit QS stable
and unstable ﬁxed points. Likewise, Bien (1978) and Edelman (1985) highlighted some

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we clarify the deﬁnition of quasi-satellite motion and estimate a validity
limit of the averaged approach by revisiting the planar and circular Restricted Three-Body
Problem .

First of all, we focussed on the co-orbital resonance via the averaged problem and showed
that the study of the phase portraits of the reduced averaged problem parametrized by e0
allow to understand its global dynamics. Indeed, they reveal that tadpole, horseshoe and
quasi-satellite domains are structured around four families of ﬁxed points originating from
L4, L5 (Ge0
QS). By increasing e0,
the quasi-satellite orbits appear inside the domain opened by the collision curve for e0 > 0
and becomes dominant for high eccentricities. On the contrary, tadpole and horseshoe
domains shrink and vanish when Ge0
L3. Moreover, we
showed that this remaining family bifurcates and generates a new domain of high eccentric
orbits librating around (θ, u) = (180˚, 0).

L4 and Ge0

L4 and Ge0

However, the averaged approaches having the drawback to be poorly signiﬁcant in the
exclusion zone, we highlighted that for suﬃciently small eccentricities, the whole quasi-
satellite domain is contained inside it which makes this type of motion not reachable
by averaging process. The study of the evolution of the libration and secular precession
frequencies along Ge0
QS, allowed us to show that the family f and a fortiori the quasi-satellite
domain are not reachable by e0 < 0.18 in a Sun-Jupiter like system.

In order to clarify the terminology to use between “retrograde satellite” or “quasi-
satellite” when these orbits are close encountering trajectories with the planet, we re-
visited the works on the family f in the rotating frame. We highlighted that the family
f possesses two particular orbits that divide its neighbourhood in three connected areas:
the retrograde satellite, binary quasi-satellite and heliocentric quasi-satellite domains. We
established that the last one is the only one reachable in the averaged approaches.

The study of the frequencies of the ﬁxed point families of the reduced averaged problem
has also shown some frozen orbits in the heliocentric frame which are equivalent to circles
of ﬁxed points in the averaged problem. In order to exhibit ﬁxed points when the planet’s
orbit is eccentric, we highlighted numerically that from each circles of ﬁxed points originates
at least two families of ﬁxed points parametrized by the planet eccentricity. Among them,
Ge′
QS,1 is the most interesting as it is in quasi-satellite motion with a conﬁguration of two
anti-aligned ellipses and connected to the stable family described in Hadjidemetriou et al.
(2009) in the planetary problem. Moreover, Ge′
QS,1 as well as the family in the planetary
problem possess a conﬁguration with equal eccentricities for an eccentricity value close
to 0.565. As a consequence, this suggests that this remarkable conﬁguration is weakly
dependent to the ratio between the planetary masses. Likewise, let us mentioned that this
conﬁguration is similar to those of the family “A.1/1” described in Broucke (1975) in the

24

general Three-Body Problem with three equal masses which suggests a connection between
them.

When e0 > 0.4, we denoted that the moduli of the libration frequency ν and of the
secular precession frequency g along the family f are of the same order than those of the
two tadpole periodic orbit families. Thus, in the framework of long-term dynamics of the
Jovian quasi-satellite asteroids in the solar system, we can assume that a study of the global
dynamics by means of the frequency map analysis will reveal resonant structures close to
those of the trojans identiﬁed in Robutel and Gabern (2006). However, by remarking that
the direction of the perihelion precession being the opposite of those of the planets in
the solar system, resonances with these secular frequencies should be of higher order in
comparison to the tadpoles orbits. On the contrary, resonances with their node precession
should be of lower order. These questions will be addressed in a forthcoming work
