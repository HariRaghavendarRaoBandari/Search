The Mott-insulating distorted perovskite SmTiO3, doped with a single SrO layer in a quantum-
well architecture is studied by the combination of density functional theory with dynamical mean-
ﬁeld theory. A rich correlated electronic structure in line with recent experimental investigations
is revealed by the given realistic many-body approach to a large-unit-cell oxide heterostructure.
Coexistence of conducting and Mott-insulating TiO2 layers prone to magnetic order gives rise to
multi-orbital electronic transport beyond standard Fermi-liquid theory. Hints towards a pseudogap
opening due to electron-electron scattering within a background of antiferromagnetic ﬂuctuations
are detected.

[1]

Doped Mott insulators pose a challenging problem
in condensed matter physics (see e.g.
for a re-
view). At stoichiometry, simple correlated metals show
renormalized Landau-like quasiparticles, while charge-
gapped Mott (including charge-transfer) insulators often
reveal long-range order at low temperature with again a
Landau-like order parameter. On the contrary, promi-
nent materials such as e.g. high-Tc cuprates, double-
exchange driven manganites or the correlated-spin-orbit
iridate family prove that doping a Mott-insulating state
can give rise to novel intricate phases, often beyond the
Landau paradigm.

The in-depth experimental and theoretical analysis of
the eﬀect of random electron or hole doping in bulk
systems is usually hindered by the impact of disorder
on introduced charges and local structural relaxations.
This renders the deﬁnition of relevant length scales, e.g.
screening distances, diﬃcult. Due to the complexity of
the problem, many theoretical modelings of doped cor-
related materials, especially on the model-Hamiltonian
level, neglect details of the local chemistry aspect from
doping. But this may be insuﬃcient to elucidate the sub-
tle energy-scale balancing of strongly correlated electrons
in systems prone to longe-range order.

Two developments are eligible to shed new light on
this longstanding problem. First the rising ﬁeld of ox-
ide heterostructures allows nowadays experimentally to
introduce well-deﬁned doping layers in correlated mate-
rials [2, 3]. Thereby the problem of disorder and the
ambiguities in identifying unique length scales are re-
moved. Second the combination of ﬁrst-principles den-
sity functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-ﬁeld
theory (DMFT) accounts for the interplay of chem-
istry/bandstructure features and many-body eﬀects be-
yond the realm of static-correlation approaches [4, 5]. Al-
lying these progresses by addressing a well-deﬁned doped
Mott-insulator heterostructure via DFT+DMFT is thus
proper to reveal new insight into a hallmark challenge of
interacting electrons.

The distorted perovskite SmTiO3 as a member of the
RTiO3 (R: rare-earth element) series with formal Ti3+-
3d(t1
2g) conﬁguration is Mott-insulating at stoichiome-

try. It displays antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below
TN = 45K. Notably, within the given 3d1 titanate series
the compound is just at the border of a quantum-critical
transformation from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
(FM) order [9]. Recent experimental work focusing on
δ-doping SmTiO3 by a single SrO layer exposed non-
Fermi-liquid (NFL) character, with a subtle crossover to
still intriguing transport behavior when adding further
doping layers [6–8].

In this work, a realistic many-body approach is em-
ployed to resolve the intricate multi-orbital correlated
electronic structure of δ-doped SmTiO3. We reveal a
coexistence between itinerant and Mott-insulating real-
space regions associated with diﬀerent degrees of orbital
polarization. Non-Fermi-liquid behavior originates from
the corresponding internal boundaries. Eventually, the
scattering of itinerant carriers with AFM spin ﬂuctua-
tions is blamed for a pseudogap ﬁngerprint, giving rea-
son for the realistic NFL regime . These ﬁndings pave the
road for theoretical investigations of oxide interfaces con-
ducted by materials-design approaches beyond the pos-
sibilities of static mean-ﬁeld studies.

Charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT [10–12]

is used
to access the many-body correlated electronic struc-
ture. For the DFT part, a mixed-basis pseudopotential
method [13], employing the generalized-gradient approxi-
mation (GGA) in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form [14],
is put into practice. The partially-ﬁlled Sm(4f ) shell is
treated in the frozen-core approximation since the highly-
localized 4f electrons do not have key inﬂuence on the
present doped-Mott physics. Our correlated subspace
consists of the eﬀective Ti(t2g) Wannier-like functions
wn(t2g),
is locally threefold. The wn(t2g) func-
tions are obtained from the projected-local-orbital for-
malism [18–21], using as projection functions the linear
combinations of atomic t2g orbitals that diagonalize the
Ti local wn(t2g)-orbital density matrix. A band main-
fold of 60 t2g-based Kohn-Sham states at low energy are
used to realize the projection. Local Coulomb interac-
tions in Slater-Kanamori form for the wn(t2g) orbitals are
parametrized by a Hubbard U = 5eV and a Hund’s cou-
pling JH = 0.64eV [22]. The single-site DMFT impurity

problems [15] are solved by the continuous-time quantum
Monte Carlo scheme [16, 17]. A double-counting correc-
tion of fully-localized type [23] is utilized. To obtain the
spectral information, analytical continuation from Mat-
subara space via the maximum-entropy method is per-
formed. About 40-50 DFT+DMFT iterations (of alter-
nating Kohn-Sham and impurity steps) are usually nec-
essary for convergence.

To set the stage,

lets focus ﬁrst on the electronic
structure of the stoichiometric SmTiO3 compound (cf.
Fig. 1a), based on the structural data from Komarek
et al. [9]. Besides the lattice parameters, charateris-
tic for the GdFeO3-type distorted-perosvskite structure
(space group P bnm) are the Ti-O(1,2)-Ti bond angles,
whereby O1(2) is the apical(basal in-plane) oxygen po-
sition with respect to the c-axis.
In bulk SmTiO3,
these angles read ϕ1, ϕ2 = 146◦, 147◦ [9]. Within DFT,
the Ti(t2g) states form an isolated low-energy metal-
lic band manifold of width W ∼ 1.55eV. A small or-
bital polarization towards an nearly isotropic eﬀective
t2g state |2i = 0.58|xzi + 0.53|yzi + 0.62|xyi is detected.
The remaining two eﬀective t2g orbitals are given by
|1i = 0.76|xzi − 0.63|yzi − 0.17|xyi and |3i = 0.30|xzi +

0.57|yzi − 0.78|xyi. In line with experiment, strong elec-
tron correlation within DFT+DMFT drive the material
paramagnetic (PM) Mott insulating by eﬀectively local-
izing a single t2g electron on the Ti site. Furthermore,
as observed in theoretical assessments of other Mott-
insulating 3d1 titanates [22, 24, 25] there is a substantial
polarization, here towards state |2i, i.e. the orbital occu-
pation numbers are (n1, n2, n3) = (0.15, 0.75, 0.10). If we
deﬁne the charge gap ∆g by spectral weight < 10−4 eV−1,
a value ∆g = 0.55eV is obtained, in good agreement with
the mid-infrared-absorption onset of 0.50eV measured by
Crandles et al. [26].

The δ-doped SmTiO3 architecture is realized by a
100-atom unit-cell superlattice.
It consists of 10(9)
TiO2(SmO) layers, separated by a single SrO monolayer
(see Fig. 1b). Each TiO2 layer is build from two possi-
bly symmetry-inequivalent Ti ions, to allow for potential
intra-layer spin or charge ordering. Together with the
ﬁve-layer resolution away from the doping layer, there
are thus 10 inequivalent Ti single-site DMFT problems
in our realistic modelling. The Mott insulator is doped
with two holes, i.e. nominally 0.1 hole per Ti ion. Note
that the experimental setting of Ref. [6, 7] was such that

the original c-axis is parallel to the doping layer and the
original a, b-axes are respectively inclined. To account for
this fact approximatively, we also bring the original lat-
tice parameters [9] in the same directional form, but with-
out lowering the P bnm symmetry. All atomic positions
in the cell are structurally relaxed within DFT(GGA).
Figure 1b shows, that close to the interfacing SrO layer
the bond angles ϕ1,2 are enhanced. There the system
is structurally driven in the direction of cubic SrTiO3.
As expected, beyond 3-4 layers the characteristic angles
saturate to bulk-like values [27]. Also non-surprisingly,
this saturation happens faster in terms of layers for the
in-plane angle, since the out-of-plane ϕ1 is here stronger
aﬀected from a plane-parallel interface.

The PM many-body electronic structure upon δ-
doping is exhibited in Figs. 1c,d.
In line with exper-
imental ﬁndings [6], DFT+DMFT reveals metallicity,
with however rather diﬀerent characteristics as obtained
from GGA. The total correlated spectral function A(k, ω)
shows strong band narrowing and transfer of spectral
weight to Hubbard bands. These processes appear to
depend rather signiﬁcantly on the temperature T , ren-
dering it obvious that T plays here a far more subtle role
than in standard realistic DMFT investigations. Com-
parison between T = 48K, 30K data shows that the over-
all electronic coherence scale at low energy is ﬁnally es-
tablished, giving rise to a lower Hubbard band at around
−1.2eV. Notably within a small [−0.1,0.1]eV energy win-
dow around the Fermi level, a three-peak quasiparticle
(QP) structure settles. It should not be confused with
the conventional large-energy-range three-peak structure
involving lower and upper Hubbard bands.

More details are revealed from the inspection of the
Ti-resolved local spectral function. We did not encounter
PM intra- or inter-layer charge-ordering instabilities for
the inspected T range. Especially the in-plane Ti ions
behave equivalent, thus there is no need for intra-layer
diﬀerentiation in the discussion. But note that in the
δ-doped structure the eﬀective t2g correlated subspace
(|1i, |2i, |3i) becomes Ti-dependent for the inequivalent
positions. Still, generic ﬂavors allow for a grouping into
the three former subclasses. Diﬀerent electronic phases
are detected with distance to the SrO doping layer. While
the nearest-layer TiO2 layer is orbital-balanced conduct-
ing at each temperature, the layers beyond the second one

T . The second layer itself is metallic, however displays
strong correlations with already substantial orbital po-
larization. All orbital polarizations are in favor of the |2i
class. With raising temperature, the more distant layers
partly also obtain metallic character, but in a very inco-
herent fashion without clear QP formation. The orbital
occupations only weakly depend on T but have strong
layer dependence (see Tab. I). As in the bulk, layers 3-
5 localize one electron in the Ti(t2g) shell, whereas the
2nd layer with about 0.9 electrons is in a doped-Mott
state. The ﬁrst layer with 0.6 electrons appears as a
renormalized metal. Hence between diﬀerent TiO2 lay-
ers, intricate metal-insulator transitions with strong or-
bital signature and delicate T dependence below room
temperature are revealed.

In order to assess the transport characteristics of the
two conducting TiO2 layers, the low-frequency behavior
of the respective orbital-resolved self-energies Σ(iωn) is
analyzed in Fig. 2. We display the QP weight Z = (1 −
∂Im Σ(iωn)
and the electron-electron
scattering rate βΓ = −βZ Im Σ(i0+), whereby m denotes
the eﬀective mass and β = 1/T . For the rest of the paper,
we refer to the nearest(next-nearest) TiO2 plane with
respect to the SrO doping plane as ’ﬁrst(second) layer’.
Whereas the ﬁrst layer shows well-developed Fermi-liquid
like scattering and moderate Z1 ∼ 0.6, the second layer
inherits strong scattering and a much smaller formal
Z2 ∼ 0.2. In line with this observation, an exponential-
function ﬁt of the self-energies is performed. An ideal ex-
ponent α = 1 would correspond to a well-deﬁned Fermi
liquid with T 2-law for the resistivity. Here a Fermi-liquid-
like exponent α1 = 0.97 for the ﬁrst layer is extracted,
while for the dominant orbital |2i in the second layer a
value α2 = 0.85 is obtained. The latter value resembles
very closely the experimentally obtained NFL T 5/3-law
for δ-doped SmTiO3 [6]. Thus the second layer, medi-

ating between the Fermi-liquid and the Mott-insulating
layers, is put into a non-Fermi-liquid regime. This hap-
pens when the overall coherence scale is already reached,
hence a conventional bad-metal picturing is not easily
applicable.

To shed further light onto the nature of this NFL be-
havior, possible broken-symmetry states are taken into
account. Albeit various initializing starting points are in-
vestigated, again (spin-broken-assisted) charge-ordering
instabilities are not supported by the present theoretical
schemes. On the other hand, A-type antiferromagnetic
ordering, i.e. intra-layer FM and inter-layer AFM order,
is a readily stable solution on the GGA level. Start-
ing from that solution, DFT+DMFT quickly converges
towards the same-kind many-body A-type AFM phase
at low temperatures, which spectral characteristics are
shown in Fig 3a. There is strongly reduced total spec-
tral weight at the Fermi level compared to GGA, but the
ﬁrst layer exhibits spin-polarized QP-like peaks at εF.
The delicate second FM layer is again strongly orbital-
as well as spin-polarized, and notably already insulating.
Intra-layer (or G-type) AFM ordering is not a competi-
tor, although various starting points and mixing schemes
were applied to stabilize such a metastable solution.

Yet an important observation has been made, which
delivers relevant information concerning the many-body
ﬂuctuations in the present system: When starting from
the previous PM solution and allowing for spin polar-

4

ization, DFT+DMFT converges back to the original PM
phase via an intriuging intermediate pseudogap state (cf.
Fig 3b). The prominent pseudogap signature with a
width ∆PG ∼0.1eV is quasi-stable for many calculational
steps. Local moments are rather small in that state and
the second layer still carries unusual low-energy char-
acter.
Interestingly, the pseudogap is associated with
orbital- and spin-balanced electron charateristics in the
ﬁrst layer. Hence the former PM Fermi-liquid attached
to SrO layer is rather fragile and strongly aﬀected by ﬂuc-
tuations around that PM solution. Due to the dominant
magnetic instability in δ-doped SmTiO3, the intermedi-
ate pseudogap state is interpreted to originate from the
proximity to the detected AFM ordering. Scattering of
ﬁrst-layer itinerant electrons at emerging AFM moments
in the deeper layers below causes a signiﬁcant spectral-
weight reduction at εF. An emerging pseudogap is in-
deed reported in very recent tunneling-spectroscopy ex-
periments on few-layer SrO-doped SmTiO3 [28].

To summarize, we revealed layer-dependent multi-
orbital metal-insulator transitions in δ-doped SmTiO3
with delicate temperature dependence. Those foster un-
conventional metallicity for the two TiO2 layers close to a
SrO doping layer and nearly completely orbital-polarized
Mott-insulating layers beyond. The next-nearest TiO2
layer is critical in the sense that its mediation between
the Fermi-liquid metallic layer and the Mott layers re-
sults in NFL transport behavior that matches experi-
mental ﬁndings. This NFL regime is associated with
strong AFM ﬂuctuations that can lead to a pseudogap
structure at the Fermi
level. Pseudogap behavior is
well known for the twodimensional one-band Hubbard
model prone to AFM order [29–33], described beyond
single-site DMFT. But here, intriguing intra/inter-layer-
resolved self-energies are suﬃcient to provide a multi-
orbital ﬁngerprint of such a ﬂuctuation-dominated phase
in the pre-converged correlated self-consistency cycle.
Full stabilization of the pseudogap phase asks for inter-
site self-energies in the theoretical description. However
note that the present pseudogap physics does not emerge
from in-plane correlations parallel to the interface, but
from perpendicular-to-interface correlations. This may
create room for novel designing options of this ﬂuctua-
tion physics in terms of diﬀerent layering/spacing.

The present many-body oxide-heterostructure study
shall stimulate the investigation of novel emergent
eletronic phases by advanced theoretical means on the
realistic level. There is the possibility to extend the
formalism to cover further possible ordering instabili-
ties, e.g. unconventional superconductivity [34], Kondo-
impurity(lattice) formation [35], or correlation-triggered
topological order.
