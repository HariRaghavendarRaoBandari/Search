WELL–POSEDNESS OF HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS WITH

MULTIPLICITIES AND SMOOTH COEFFICIENTS

CLAUDIA GARETTO AND CHRISTIAN J ¨AH

Abstract. In this paper we study hyperbolic systems with multiplici-
ties and smooth coeﬃcients. In the case of non-analytic coeﬃcients we
prove well-posedness in any Gevrey class and when the coeﬃcients are
analytic we prove C∞ well-posedness. The proof is based on a reduc-
tion to block Sylvester form introduced by D’Ancona and Spagnolo in
[8] which increases the system size but does not change the eigenvalues.
This reduction introduces lower order terms for which appropriate Levi
type conditions are found. These translate then into conditions on the
original coeﬃcients matrix. This paper can be considered as a generali-
sation of [11] where weakly hyperbolic higher order equations with lower
order terms were considered.

We consider the Cauchy problem

(1)

(cid:26) Dtu − A(t, Dx)u = 0, (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rn,

u|t=0 = u0, x ∈ Rn,

where Dt = −i∂t, Dx = −i∂x, A(t, Dx) is an m × m matrix of ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential operators with time-dependent coeﬃcients and u is a column

vector with components u1, . . . , um. We assume that (1) is hyperbolic,
whereby we mean that the matrix A(t, ξ) has only real eigenvalues . These
eigenvalues, rescaled to order 0 by multiplying by hξi−1, will be denoted by
λ1(t, ξ), . . . , λm(t, ξ). Following Kinoshita and Spagnolo in [20], we assume
throughout this paper that there exists a positive constant C such that

(2)

λ2
i (t, ξ) + λ2

j (t, ξ) ≤ C(λi(t, ξ) − λj(t, ξ))2, (t, ξ) ∈ [0, T ] × Rn

for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m.

As observed in [13] combining the well-posedness results in [19, 23] we
already know that the Cauchy problem (1) is well-posed in the Gevrey class
γs, with

1 ≤ s < 1 +

1
m

as well as in the corresponding spaces of (Gevrey-Beurling) ultradistribu-
tions.
In this paper we want to prove that when A has smooth coeﬃ-
cients and the condition (2) on the eigenvalues holds then the Gevrey well-
posedness result above can be extended to any s. Since, by the results of
Kajitani and Yuzawa when s ≥ 1 + 1
m at least an ultradistributional solu-
tion to the Cauchy problem (1) exists, we will prove that this solution does
actually belong to the Gevrey class γs. In the case of analytic coeﬃcients
we will prove instead that the Cauchy problem (1) is C ∞ well-posed.

In this paper we assume that the Gevrey classes γs(Rn) are well-known:
these are spaces of all f ∈ C ∞(Rn) such that for every compact set K ⊂ Rn
there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all β ∈ Nn
0 we have the estimate

|∂βf (x)| ≤ C |β|+1(β!)s.

x∈K

For s = 1, we obtain the class of analytic functions. We refer to [10] for a de-
tailed discussion and Fourier characterisations of Gevrey spaces of diﬀerent
types and the deﬁnition of the corresponding spaces of ultradistributions.

The well-posedness of hyperbolic equations and systems with multiplic-
ities has been a challenging problem for a long time. In the last decades
several results have been obtained for scalar equations with t-dependent co-
eﬃcients ([2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 20], to quote a few) but the research
on hyperbolic systems with multiplicities has not been as successful. We
mention here the work of D’Ancona, Kinoshita and Spagnolo on weakly hy-
perbolic systems (i.e. systems with multiplicities) of size 2 × 2 and 3 × 3
with H¨older dependent coeﬃcients later generalised to any matrix size by
Yuzawa in [23] and to (t, x)-dependent coeﬃcients by Kajitani and Yuzawa
in [19]. In all these papers well-posedness is obtained in Gevrey classes of a
certain order depending on the regularity of the coeﬃcients and the system
size. Systems of this type have been also recently investigated in [9, 13].

It is a natural question to ask if under stronger assumptions of regu-
larity of the coeﬃcients, for instance smooth or analytic coeﬃcients, the
well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem could be improved,

HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLICITIES

in the sense if one could get well-posedness in every Gevrey class or C ∞-
well-posedness. It is known that this is possible for scalar equations under
suitable assumptions on the multiple roots and Levi conditions on the lower
order terms, see [11, 20] for C k and C ∞ coeﬃcients and [11, 15, 20] for
analytic coeﬃcients. This paper gives a positive answer to this question by
extending the results for scalar equations in [11, 20] to systems with mul-
tiplicities. This will require a reduction into block Sylvester form of the
system in (1) which increases the system size from m × m to m2 × m2 but
does not change the eigenvalues, in the sense that every block will have
the same eigenvalues of A. Such a reduction, introduced by D’Ancona and
Spagnolo in [8], has the side eﬀect to generate a matrix of lower order terms
even when the original system is homogeneous, i.e., (1) will be transformed
into a Cauchy problem of the type

(cid:26) DtU = A(t, Dx)U + B(t, Dx)U,

U |t=0 = U0.

It becomes therefore crucial to understand how the lower order terms in B
are related to the matrix A and which Levi conditions have to be formulated
on them to get the desired well-posedness. These Levi conditions will be then
expressed in terms of the matrix A. In the next subsection we collect our
main results and we give a scheme of the proof.

1.1. Results and scheme of the proof. In the sequel,

(λ) = 1, where λ = (λ1, . . . , λm) is given by the rescaled eigenvalues

of A and πiλ = (λ1, ..., λi−1, λi+1, ..., λm). Moreover, given f = f (t, ξ) and
g(t, ξ) we use the notation f ≺ g when it exists a constant C > 0 such that
f (t, ξ) ≤ Cg(t, ξ) for all t ∈ [0, T ] and ξ ∈ Rn.

Theorem 1.1. Let A(t, Dx), t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rn, be an m × m matrix of
ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators with smooth coeﬃcients. Let A have real
eigenvalues satisfying condition (2). Assume that the Cauchy problem

(cid:26) DtU = A(t, Dx)U + B(t, Dx)U,

U |t=0 = U0.

obtained from (1) by block Sylvester reduction has the lower order terms

Cauchy problem (1).

The formulation of the Levi conditions given above requires a precise
knowledge of the matrix B. It is possible to state the previous well-posedness
result completely in terms of the matrix A and the Cauchy problem (1). This
means to introduce an additional hypothesis on A which implies the Levi
conditions on B. In the ﬁnal section of the paper we will prove that in some
cases, for instance when m = 2, this second formulation is equivalent to the
one given in Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. Let A(t, Dx), t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rn, be an m × m matrix of
ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators with smooth coeﬃcients. Let A have real
eigenvalues satisfying condition (2) and let Q = (qij) be the symmetriser of
A0 = hξi−1A. Assume that

max

k=1,...,m−1

kDk

t A0k2 ≺ qj,j

for all j = 1, . . . , m − 1. Hence, for all s ≥ 1 and for all u0 ∈ γs(Rn)m there
exists a unique solution u ∈ C 1([0, T ], γs(Rn))m of the Cauchy problem (1).

Since the entries of the symmetriser are polynomials depending on the
eigenvalues of A, we require in Theorem 1.2 that the t-derivatives of A
up to order m − 1 are bounded by suitable polynomials of the eigenvalues
λ1, . . . , λm. Note that, as observed already in the appendix of [11] these
polynomials can be expressed in terms of the entries of A.

When the entries of A are analytic then we prove that the Cauchy problem
(1) is C ∞ well-posed. The precise statements can be obtained by replacing
γs with C ∞ in Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2.

We conclude this subsection by presenting the scheme of the proof of

Theorem 1.1 which combines ideas from [8] and [11] .

Step 1 Compute the adjunct matrix adj(Imτ − A(t, ξ)) = cof(Imτ −
AT (t, ξ)), where Im is the identity matrix of size m × m. We thus
have the relation

adj(Imτ − A(t, ξ))(Imτ − A(t, ξ)) =

ch(t, ξ)Imτ h,

mXh=0

where the ch(t, ξ) are homogeneous polynomials of order m − h
in ξ.

Step 2 Apply the operator adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx)), associated to the sym-
bol adj(Imτ −A(t, ξ)), to the system (1) and obtain a set of scalar
equations for u1 to um, where the operator acting on these is as-
sociated to det(Imτ − A(t, ξ)). Additionally one gets some lower
order terms which can be computed explicitly.

Step 3 Convert the resulting set of equations

det(ImDt − A(t, Dx))u + l.o.t = 0

HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLICITIES

to Sylvester block diagonal form following the method of Taylor
in [21], i.e by setting

(3)

U = (U1, U2, . . . , Um)T , where

Uk =(cid:0)hDxim−1uk, DthDxim−2uk, . . . , Dm−1

t

uk(cid:1)

for k = 1, . . . , m. This transformation maps each equation to
a system in Sylvester form and glues those systems in block di-
agonal form together. Hence we achieve a block diagonal form
with Sylvester blocks associated to the characteristic polynomial
of (1). This means that each block will have the same eigenvalues
of A. The initial data will be transformed in the same way to
obtain a new set of initial data U0 for the new system.

Step 4 Consider the resulting system

(4)

(cid:26) DtU = A(t, Dx)U + B(t, Dx)U

U |t=0 = U0

,

where A(t, Dx) and B(t, Dx) are matrices of size m2 × m2 with a
special structure. As explained above, A(t, Dx) is a block diago-
nal matrix with m identical blocks of Silvester matrices having the
same eigenvalues of A and B(t, Dx) is composed of m × m2 blocks
with only the last row not identically zero. Since the original ho-
mogeneous system has been transformed into a system with lower
order terms, to get well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy
problem (4), we need to ﬁnd some Levi-type conditions. These
are obtained by following the ideas for scalar equations in [11].

Step 5 We apply the partial Fourier transform with respect to x to (4)
and we prove an energy estimate from which the assertions of the
well-posedness theorems follow in a standard way. A key point is
the construction of the quasi-symmetriser of the matrix A(t, ξ).

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we present a short survey
on the quasi-symmetriser which will be employed to formulate the energy
estimate. The core of Section 3 is the reduction to block Sylvester form. An
explicit description of adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx)) and the resulting lower order
terms is also given in Section 3 together with a detailed scheme of the proof
in the cases m = 2 and m = 3. Section 4 is devoted to the energy estimate
and Section 5 to the estimates for the lower order terms. The paper ends
with the well-posedness results in Section 6 and the Appendix L, where we
collect some algebraic results concerning adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx)).

2. The quasi-symmetriser

Here we recall some facts about the quasi-symmetriser that we will need
throughout the paper. For more details see [8, 20]. Note that for m × m
matrices A1 and A2 the notation A1 ≤ A2 means (A1v, v) ≤ (A2v, v) for

We ﬁnally recall that a family {Qα} of non-negative Hermitian matrices

is called nearly diagonal if there exists a positive constant c0 such that

Qα ≥ c0 diag Qα

for all α, with diag Qα = diag{qα,11, ..., qα,mm}. The following linear algebra
result is proven in [20, Lemma 1].

Lemma 2.2. Let {Qα} be a family of non-negative Hermitian m × m ma-
trices such that det Qα > 0 and

det Qα ≥ c qα,11qα,22 · · · qα,mm

for a certain constant c > 0 independent of α. Then,

Qα ≥ c m1−m diag Qα

for all α, i.e., the family {Qα} is nearly diagonal.

Lemma 2.2 is employed to prove that the family Q(m)

(λ) of quasi-sym-
metrisers deﬁned above is nearly diagonal when λ belongs to a suitable set.

We conclude this section with a result on nearly diagonal matrices de-
pending on three parameters, ε, t, and ξ which will be crucial in the next
section. Note that this is a straightforward extension of Lemma 2 in [20]
valid for matrices depending on two parameters, ε and t.

Lemma 2.4. Let {Q(m)

3. Sylvester block diagonal reduction

This section is devoted to the Sylvester block diagonal reduction that
will be employed on the system (1). This reduction has been introduced by
D’Ancona and Spagnolo in [8]. Here we give a detailed description of how
this reduction works on the system ImDt − A(t, Dx) and we present explicit
formulas for the matrix of lower order terms generated by the procedure.
Note that these results are obtained from general linear algebra statements
that are collected in the appendix at the end of the paper. We will refer to
Appendix L throughout this section. The subsections refer to the steps of
the proof outlined in Subsection1.1.

3.1. Step 1: The adjunct adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx)). A straightforward ap-
plication of Lemma L.2 leads us to the following proposition.

Proposition 3.1. Let ImDt − A(t, Dx) be the operator in (1). Then,

adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx)) =

Ah(t, Dx)Dm−1−h

where

(6)

λ = (λ1, . . . , λm) and σ(m)
(λ) as deﬁned in (5). The diﬀerential operator
adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx)) is of order m − 1 with respect to Dt and every diﬀer-
ential operator Ah(t, Dx), 1 ≤ h ≤ m, is of order h with respect to Dx. We
set A0(t, Dx) = Im.

h

Proposition 3.1 completes Step 1 of our proof. We can therefore proceed

to Step 2.

3.2. Step 2: Computation of the lower order terms.

Proposition 3.2. The lower order terms that arise after applying the ad-
junct adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx)) to the original operator ImDt − A(t, Dx) are
given by

(7)

Using that Am = 0 (thanks to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, see (55)) and
A0 = Im, we obtain (11) which concludes the proof. (cid:4)
(cid:3)

It will be convenient for the description of some important matrices in this
paper to rewrite the lower order terms in a diﬀerent way. More precisely,
we have the following corollary.

Corollary 3.3. We can write the lower order term in (7) as

(12)

where

B(t, Dt, Dx) = −

Bh+1(t, Dx)Dh

(13) Bh+1(t, Dx) =

A)(t, Dx)

and Ah′(t, Dx) is given by (6).

Proof. Formula (12) follows from (7) by interchanging the order of the sums
appropriately. Indeed, we have, using (6) and (8), that

Note that in computing Bh+1 in the last line of (14), we use the binomial

m−1−h−k(cid:1) =(cid:0)m−1−h

k

(cid:1) and reorder the summation. This completes

(cid:3)

the proof after relabelling summation indices. (cid:4)

Note that by rewriting the lower order terms as in Corollary 3.3 we clearly
see that B(t, Dt, Dx) is of order m − 2 in Dt rather than of order m − 1. As
explanatory examples we give a closer look to the operator B(t, Dt, Dx) in
the cases m = 2 and m = 3.

Example 3.1. Consider m = 2: The sum in (12) has only one term. We
have

B1(t, Dx) = A0(t, Dx)(DtA)(t, Dx)

12

CLAUDIA GARETTO AND CHRISTIAN J ¨AH

with A0(t, Dx) = σ(2)

0 (λ)A0(t, Dx) = I2 (see Lemma L.2).

Example 3.2. Consider m = 3. The sum in (12) has two terms. We have

B1(t, Dx) =

1Xh′=0(cid:18)2 − h′

0 (cid:19)Ah′(t, Dx)(D2−h′

t A)(t, Dx) + A1(t, Dx)(DtA)(t, Dx),

t A)(t, Dx) + (A(t, Dx) − tr(A)(t, Dx)I3)(DtA)(t, Dx),

and

B2(t, Dx) = 2A0(t, Dx)(DtA)(t, Dx) = 2(DtA)(t, Dx).

Here we used the fact that A0(t, Dx) = σ(3)
− tr(A)(t, Dx) (see Lemma L.2).

0 (λ)A0(t, Dx) = I3 and σ(3)

Corollary 3.3 completes Step 2 of our proof and allows us to transform

(1) into
(15)

adj(ImDt − A(t, Dx))(ImDt−A(t, Dx))u

= δ(t, Dt, Dx)Imu + B(t, Dt, Dx)u = 0,

where δ(t, Dt, Dx) has symbol det(Imτ − A(t, ξ)) and B(t, Dt, Dx) is given
by (12). Note that δ(t, Dt, Dx) is the scalar operator

Dm

t +

m−1Xh=0

with ch(t, ξ) homogeneous polynomial of order m−h and therefore δ(t, Dt, Dx)Im
is a decoupled system of m equations of order m while B(t, Dt, Dx) is a sys-
tem of diﬀerential operators of order m − 1.

3.3. Step 3: Reduction to a ﬁrst order system of pseudodiﬀeren-
tial equations. We now transform the system in (15) into a system of
pseudodiﬀerential equations by following Taylor in [21]. More precisely, we
transform each m-th order scalar equation in δ(t, Dt, Dx)Im into a ﬁrst or-
der pseudodiﬀerential system in Sylvester form. In this way we obtain m
systems with identical Sylvester matrix which can be put together in block-
diagonal form obtaining a block-diagonal m2 × m2 matrix with m identical
Sylvester blocks. The precise structure of the lower order terms will be
worked out in the next subsection.

To carry out this transformation, we set

(16)

U = (U1, . . . , Um)T ∈ Rm2

Ui :=(cid:16)Dj−1

t

hDxim−j ui(cid:17)j=1,...,m

∈ Rm,

i = 1, . . . , m,

where the ui are the components of the original vector u in (1).

HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLICITIES

We can rewrite the Cauchy problem for (15) as

(17)

U |t=0 = U0 = (U0,1, · · · , U0,m)T ,

(cid:26) DtU = A(t, Dx)U + B(t, Dx)U,

,

where the components U0,i of the m2-column vector U0 are given by

and u is the solution of the Cauchy problem (1) with u(0, x) = u0. Passing
now to analyse the matrices A(t, Dx) and B(t, Dx) we have that A(t, Dx)
is an m2 × m2 block diagonal matrix of m identical blocks of size m × m of
the type

ferential operators of order 1 and 0, respectively.

3.4. Step 4: Structure of the matrix B(t, Dx) of the lower order
terms. To analyse the structure of the m2 × m2 matrix B(t, Dx) we recall
that it is obtained from the m × m matrix B(t, Dt, Dx) in (15) via the
transformation (16). From Corollary 3.3 we have that

where the b(h+1)
(t, Dx) denote the (i, j)-element of Bh+1(t, Dx) in (12).
By the previously described transform (16) we obtain that the coeﬃcients
b(1)
ij (t, Dx) in (20) will be associated to li,1+(j−1)m(t, Dx) for j = 1, . . . , m−1,
the coeﬃcients b(2)
ij (t, Dx) to li,2+(j−1)m(t, Dx) for j = 1, . . . , m − 1 and so
forth. In particular, we get that li,m+(j−1)m(t, Dx) ≡ 0 for j = 1, . . . , m. As
a general formula we can write

For convenience of the reader we conclude this section by illustrating the

Steps 1-4 in the case m = 2 and m = 3. For simplicity, we take x ∈ R.

3.5. Steps 1–4 for m = 2. We consider the system

(22)

Dtu − A(t)Dxu = Dt(cid:18)u1

u2(cid:19) −(cid:18)a11(t) a12(t)
0 τ(cid:19) −(cid:18) a22(t) −a12(t)

−a21(t)

0

adj(I2τ − A(t)ξ) =(cid:18)τ

for (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × R. Computing the adjunct of I2τ − A(t)ξ we obtain

Applying the corresponding operator to (22), we obtain

(I2Dt − adj(A)Dx) (I2Dt − A(t)Dxu) = δ(t, Dt, Dx)u − (DtA)(t)Dxu

(23)

= δ(t, Dt, Dx)u − B1(t, Dx)u,

where B1(t, Dx) is given by (12) with h = 0.

Now we set

U = (U1, U2, U3, U4)T = (hDxiu1, Dtu1, hDxiu2, Dtu2)T

DtU = (hDxiU2, D2

t u1, hDxiU4, D2

t u2)T .

and, thus, get the system

DtU = A(t, Dx)U + B(t, Dx)U,

where A(t, Dx) is a 4 × 4 block diagonal matrix, as in (18), with the block

and therefore

adj(I3Dt − A(t)Dx) = I3D2

t + (A(t) − tr(A)(t))I3DtDx + adj(A)(t)D2

Applying this operator to the original system, we obtain

4. Energy estimate

Now we apply the Fourier transform with respect to x to the Cauchy

problem in (17) and set Fx→ξ(U )(t, ξ) =: V (t, ξ). We then obtain

(26)

( DtV = A(t, ξ)V + B(t, ξ)V,

V |t=0 = V0,

where V0 =cU0. From now on, we will concentrate on (26) and the matrix

A0(t, ξ) := hξi−1A(t, ξ).

Note that by construction of A the matrix A0 is made of m identical
Sylvester type blocks with eigenvalues λl(t, ξ), l = 1, . . . , m, where λl(t, ξ)hξi,
l = 1, . . . , m are the rescaled eigenvalues of the original matrix A in (1).

4.1. Step 5: Computing the energy estimate. Let Q(m)
be the quasi-
symmetriser of the matrix A0. By Remark ?? it will be a m2 × m2 block
diagonal matrix with m identical blocks given by the quasi-symmetriser Q(m)
of the deﬁning block of A0 (see Section 2 for deﬁnition and properties).
Hence, we deﬁne the energy

that for all t ∈ [0, T ], ξ ∈ Rn and ε ∈ (0, 1] the following estimates hold
uniformly in V ∈ Rm2

that the family

{Q(m)

ε

(t, ξ) : ε ∈ (0, 1], t ∈ [0, T ], ξ ∈ Rn}

is nearly diagonal.

Note that since the entries of the matrix A(t, ξ) in (1) are C ∞ with respect
to t, the matrices A(t, ξ) and B(t, ξ) as well as the quasi-symmetriser have
the same regularity properties.

We now proceed by estimating the three summands in the right-hand side
of (27). Due to the block diagonal structure of the matrices involved we can
make use of the proof strategy adopted for the scalar case in [11, Subsections
4.1, 4.2, 4.3].

5. Estimates for the lower order terms

To start, we rewrite ((Q(m)

From Proposition 2.1(v) we have

)V |V ) = (m − 1)!((W (m)BV |W (m)V ) − (W (m)V |W (m)BV ))

= 2i(m − 1)! Im(W (m)BV |W (m)V ).

It follows that
|((Q(m)

0 B − B∗Q(m)

0

)V |V )| ≤ 2(m − 1)!|W (m)BV ||W (m)V |.

Since

we have that if

(31)

(Q(m)

0 V |V ) = (m − 1)!|W (m)V |2,

|W (m)BV | ≤ C|W (m)V |

holds true for some constant C > 0, independent of t, ξ and V , then estimate
(30) will hold true as well.

In the sequel, for the sake of simplicity we will make use of the following
notation: given f and g two real valued functions in the variable y, f (y) ≺
g(y) if there exists a constant C > 0 such that f (y) ≤ Cg(y) for all y. More
precisely, we will set y = (t, ξ) or y = (t, ξ, V ). Thus, (31) can be rewritten
as

|W (m)BV | ≺ |W (m)V |.

In analogy to the scalar case in [11] we will now focus on (31). Before pro-
ceeding with our general result, for advantage of the reader we will illustrate
the main ideas leading to the Levi conditions on B in the case m = 2 and
m = 3.

5.1. The case m = 2. For simplicity we take n = 1. From Subsection 3.5

Thus, we obtain that |W (2)BV |2 ≺ |W (2)V |2 is equivalent to
(32)
|Dta11(t)V1 + Dta21(t)V3|2ξhξi−1 + |Dta12(t)V1 + Dta22(t)V3|2ξhξi−1

≺ | − λ2V1 + V2|2 + | − λ1V1 + V2|2 + | − λ2V3 + V4|2 + | − λ1V3 + V4|2.

We now estimate the left-hand side of (32) from above and the right-hand
side from below. We get

|Dta11(t)V1 + Dta21(t)V3|2 + |Dta12(t)V1 + Dta22(t)V3|2

≺(cid:0)|Dta11(t)|2 + |Dta12(t)|2(cid:1) |V1|2 +(cid:0)|Dta21(t)|2 + |Dta22(t)|2(cid:1) |V3|2

2 |z1 − z2|2, z1, z2 ∈ C, and the

and, by using the inequality |z1|2 + |z2|2 ≥ 1
condition (2) on the eigenvalues,

| − λ2V1 + V2|2 + | − λ1V1 + V2|2 + | − λ2V3 + V4|2 + | − λ1V3 + V4|2

≻ (λ2 − λ1)2|V1|2 + (λ2 − λ1)2|V3|2
2)|V2|2.
≻ (λ2

2)|V1|2 + (λ2

1 + λ2

1 + λ2

Combining the last two inequalities, we ﬁnally obtain that |W (2)BV |2 ≺
|W V |2 provided that

(|Dta11(t)|2 + |Dta21(t)|2)ξhξi−1 ≺ λ2
(|Dta12(t)|2 + |Dta22(t)|2)ξhξi−1 ≺ λ2

1(t, ξ) + λ2
1(t, ξ) + λ2

2(t, ξ).

This is a Levi-type condition on the matrix of the lower order terms B
written in terms of the entries of the original matrix A in (1). Note that by

where λ2

5.2. The case m = 3. We begin by recalling that from Subsection 3.6 the
9 × 9 matrix B(t, ξ) is given by the 3 × 9 matrices Bk(t, ξ), k = 1, 2, 3, as
follows:

Note that W (3)B is a 9 × 9 matrix with three blocks of three identical rows

It is our aim to prove that |W (3)BV |2 ≺ |W (3)V |2. We do this by estimating
|W (3)BV |2 and |W (3)V |2 in diﬀerent zones. More precisely, inspired by [11]
we decompose R9 as

Thanks to the hypothesis (2) on the eigenvalues, we have the following

(cid:3)

6. Well-posedness results

In this section we prove our main result: the well-posedness of the Cauchy
problem (1). We formulate the following theorem by adopting the language
and the notations of the previous sections concerning the lower order terms.
A diﬀerent formulation will be given in Theorem 6.2. Note that Theorem 6.1
and Theorem 6.2 correspond to Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2, respectively.

Theorem 6.1. Let A(t, Dx), t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rn, be an m × m matrix of
ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators with smooth coeﬃcients. Let A have real
eigenvalues satisfying condition (2). Let

be the Cauchy problem (1). Assume that the Cauchy problem (17),

(cid:26) Dtu − A(t, Dx)u = 0, (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rn

u|t=0 = u0, x ∈ Rn

(cid:26) DtU = A(t, Dx)U + B(t, Dx)U,

U |t=0 = U0 = (U0,1, · · · , U0,m)T ,

obtained from (1) by block Sylvester reduction as in Section 3 has the lower
order terms matrix B(t, Dx) fulﬁlling the Levi conditions (40). Hence, for

HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLICITIES

33

all s ≥ 1 and for all u0 ∈ γs(Rn)m there exists a unique solution u ∈
C 1([0, T ], γs(Rn))m of the Cauchy problem (1).

Proof. We assume s > 1 since the case s = 1 is known thanks to see [16]
and [18]. By the ﬁnite propagation speed for hyperbolic equations it is not
restrictive to take compactly supported initial data and, therefore, to have
the solution u compactly supported in x. Note that if u0 ∈ γs
c (Rn)m then
by deriving the system in (1) with respect to t we immediately have that
Dj
c (Rn)m for j = 1, . . . , m − 1. It follows that if u solves (1)
then U deﬁned in (16) solves the Cauchy problem (17) with initial data
U0 ∈ γs
. This will
allow us to conclude that u ∈ C 1([0, T ], γs(Rn))m. We recall that the Cauchy
problem (17) is given by the system

. We now prove that U ∈ C 1([0, T ], γs(Rn))m2

t u(0, x) ∈ γs

c (Rn)m2

DtU = A(t, Dx)U + B(t, Dx)U,

where A is a block Sylvester matrix with m identical blocks having the
same eigenvalues of A. We make use of the energy Eε deﬁned via the quasi-
symmetriser in Section 4. Combining the energy estimate (27) with the
estimates of the ﬁrst, second and third term in Subsection 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4,
respectively, we get

(50)

∂tEε(t, ξ) ≤ (Kε(t, ξ) + C2εhξi + C3)Eε(t, ξ),

where Kε(t, ξ) is deﬁned in Subsection 4.2, the bound from above

Z T

0

Kε(t, ξ) dt ≤ C1ε−2(m−1)/k,

holds for all k ≥ 1 and C1, C2, C3 are positive constants. Note that in the
estimate (50) we have used both the condition (2) on the eigenevalues and
the Levi conditions (40). Thanks to the reduction to block Sylvester form
that we have applied to obtain the Cauchy problem (17), we deal here with
the same kind of energy employed in [11] for the scalar weakly hyperbolic
equations of order m. The proof therefore continues as the proof of Theorem
6 in [11] with the only diﬀerence that k can be taken arbitrary. This is due
to the fact that the coeﬃcients of the matrix A are smooth. It follows, by
working on the Fourier transform level, that U ∈ C 1([0, T ], γs(Rn))m2
and
therefore u ∈ C 1([0, T ], γs(Rn))m. (cid:4)
(cid:3)

We now formulate Theorem 6.1 with an additional condition on the matrix

A which implies the Levi conditions (40).

Theorem 6.2. Let A(t, Dx), t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rn, be an m × m matrix of
ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators with smooth coeﬃcients. Let A have real
eigenvalues satisfying condition (2) and let Q = (qij) be the symmetriser of
A0 = hξi−1A. Assume that

CLAUDIA GARETTO AND CHRISTIAN J ¨AH

for all j = 1, . . . , m − 1. Hence, for all s ≥ 1 and for all u0 ∈ γs(Rn)m there
exists a unique solution u ∈ C 1([0, T ], γs(Rn))m of the Cauchy problem (1).

Proof. From Proposition 3.2 and Corollary 3.3 we have that

for all l = 1, . . . , m − 1 and j = 1, . . . , m. It follows that (51) implies the
Levi conditions (40) and therefore Theorem 6.2 follows from Theorem 6.1.
(cid:4)
(cid:3)

It is clear that the hypothesis (51) on the matrix A0 = Ahξi−1 is in general
is stronger than the Levi conditions (40). However in some cases (40) and
(51) coincide as illustrated by the following examples.

Example 6.1. When m = 2 the Levi conditions (40) imply (51) (and there-
fore coincide with it). Indeed, as observed in Subsection 5.1 the Levi condi-
tions are formulated as

(|Dta11(t)|2 + |Dta21(t)|2)hξi−2 ≺ λ2
(|Dta12(t)|2 + |Dta22(t)|2)hξi−2 ≺ λ2

1(t, ξ) + λ2
1(t, ξ) + λ2

2(t, ξ),
2(t, ξ).

This implies

which is condition (51).

Example 6.2. Let us now take a 3×3 matrix A with trace zero. For simplic-
ity let us assume that n = 1 and that the eigenvalues of the corresponding A0

are λ1(t, ξ) = −pa(t)ξhξi−1, λ2(t, ξ) = 0 and λ3(t, ξ) =pa(t)ξhξi−1 with

a(t) ≥ 0 for t ∈ [0, T ]. It follows that the hypothesis (2) on the eigenvalues
is satisﬁed. By direct computations we get

1λ2

2 + λ2

q1,1 = λ2
q2,2 = (λ1 + λ2)2 + (λ1 + λ3)2 + (λ2 + λ3)2 = 2a(t)ξ2hξi−2.

3 = a(t)ξ2hξi−2,

1λ2

3 + λ2

2λ2

It follows that both q1,1 and q2,2 are comparable to a and therefore combining
(35) with (25) we conclude that

t akj + 2Dtakj|2 ≺ a(t),

|b(1)
kj |2 = |D2
|b(2)
kj |2 = |ak1Dta1j + ak2Dta2j + ak3Dta3j|2 ≺ a(t),

for k = 1, 2, 3 and j = 1, 2. We can easily see on the matrix

A(t, ξ) =

that the conditions above on the entries of A entail

We now assume that the coeﬃcients of the matrix A are analytic. We
will prove that in this case the Cauchy problem (1) with the same Levi
conditions employed above is C ∞ well-posed. The proof of the C ∞ well-
posedness follows very closely the arguments in [11]. Thus, we will only
give a sketch with the diﬀerences and refer the reader to the cited work for
details. We begin by recalling a lemma on analytic functions which proof
can be found in [11] (see Lemma 5 in [11]).

Lemma 6.3. Let f (t, ξ) be an analytic function in t ∈ [0, T ], continuous
and homogeneous of order 0 in ξ ∈ Rn. Then,

(i) for all ξ there exists a ﬁnite partition (τh(ξ)) of the interval [0, T ]

such that

0 = τ0 < τ1 < · · · < τh(ξ) < · · · < τN (ξ) = T

with supξ6=0 N (ξ) < +∞, such that f (t, ξ) 6= 0 in each open interval
(τh(ξ), τ(h+1)(ξ));

(ii) there exists a positive constant C such that

|∂tf (t, ξ)| ≤ C(cid:18)

t − τh(ξ)

+

τ(h+1)(ξ) − t(cid:19) |f (t, ξ)|

for all t ∈ (τh(ξ), τ(h+1)(ξ)), ξ ∈ Rn \ {0} and 0 ≤ h(ξ) ≤ N (ξ) − 1.

Theorem 6.4. If all entries of A(t, Dx) in (1) are analytic on [0, T ], the
eigenvalues satisfy (2) and the entries of the matrix B(t, ξ) in (17) satisfy
the Levi conditions (40) for ξ away from 0, then the Cauchy problem (1)
is C ∞ well-posed, i.e., for all u0 ∈ C ∞(Rn)m there exists a unique solution
u ∈ C 1([0, T ], C ∞(Rn))m of the Cauchy problem (1).

Proof. Thanks to the ﬁnite propagation speed property it is not restrictive
to assume that the initial data have compact support. By Remark 2.1, the
entries of the quasi-symmetriser Q(m)
(t, ξ) are analytic in t ∈ [0, T ] and,
using Proposition 2.1, can be written as

ε

(52)

qε,ij(t, ξ) = q0,ij(t, ξ) + ε2q1,ij(t, ξ) + · · · + ε2(m−1)qm−1,ij(t, ξ).

We note that qε,(i+hm)(j+hm) = qε,ij, h = 0, . . . , m − 1 due to the block-
diagonal structure of Q(m)
(t, ξ). Since all functions on the right hand side
of (52) are analytic, we can use Lemma 6.3 on each of them. Note that the
partition (τh(ξ)) in Lemma 6.3 can be chosen independent from ε.

ε

Now, following [11, 20], we use a Kovalevskayan-type energy near the
points τh(ξ) and a hyperbolic-type energy on the rest of the interval [0, T ]
(see also [17]). We start with the interval [0, τ1] (τ1 = τ1(ξ)), setting

The estimate on [0, ε] ∪ [τ1 − ε, τ1] is standard and the details are left to the
reader. We obtain, as in [11],

On [ε, τ1 − ε], we get

see also (30) in Subsection 4.4. Thanks to Proposition 2.3, the family {Q(m)

is nearly diagonal, when the eigenvalues λl, l = 1, . . . , m of A satisfy (2).
Thus, we have Qε ≥ c0 diag(Q(m)

for a certain positive constant C not depending on t and ξ. Thanks to the
block diagonal form of the quasi-symmetriser, the proof now continues as
the proof of Theorem 7 in [11]. This leads to the inequality
|V (t, ξ)| ≤ chξiN (ξ)(m−1)eN (ξ)CT hξiN (ξ)CT ,

obtained by setting ε = hξi−1. Lemma 6.3 guarantees that the function
N (ξ) is bounded in ξ. Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a κ ∈ N,
depending only on n, m, and T as well as a positive constant C > 0 such
that

|V (t, ξ)| ≤ Chξiκ|V (0, ξ)|

for all t ∈ [0, T ] and |ξ| ≥ R. Clearly this estimate implies the C ∞ well-
posedness of the Cauchy problem (1). (cid:4)
(cid:3)

Remark 6.1. Since the entries of the matrix A are at least C ∞ with respect
to t in both Theorem 6.1 and 6.4, from the system itself in (1) we obtain
that the dependence in t of the solution u is actually not only C 1 but C ∞.

Remark 6.2. In this paper we have studied homogeneous systems. Our
method, described in the previous sections, can be generalised to non-homogeneous
systems with some technical work on the lower order terms. Key point is to
investigate the relation of the matrix of the lower order terms in the original
system with the matrix B obtained after reduction to block Sylvester form.

Appendix L. Some linear algebra auxiliary results

This appendix contains some general linear algebra results which have
been employed throughout the paper. We start with the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition L.1 (Adjunct/classical adjoint). Let A ∈ Rm×m. Then, the
adjunct (or classical adjoint) of A, denoted adj(A), is deﬁned as the matrix
consisting of the elements

adj(A)ij = (−1)i+j det(Aˆjˆi),

where det(Aˆjˆi) is the determinant of the (m − 1) × (m − 1) sub-matrix of A
obtained by deletion of row j and column i. The adjunct matrix of A is the
transpose of the so-called cofactor matrix cof(A) of A.

Further information about the adjunct may be found in [14]. By a
straightforward application of the Laplace expansion formula for determi-
nants [14], one can prove the following proposition.

Proposition L.1. Let A ∈ Rm×m, then, with the above deﬁnition, we have

(i) adj(A)A = A adj(A) = det(A)Im,
(ii) adj(−A) = (−1)m−1 adj(A),
(iii) adj(AT ) = adj(A)T = cof(A).

Remark L.1. We note that the adjunct/cofactor of a matrix is not uniquely
determined if the matrix is singular. Since we use only the relation (i), we
mean by adj(A) a matrix associated to A that satisﬁes (i), speciﬁed by (56).
For further details we refer to [1, 22].

We recall that the elementary symmetric polynomials σ(m)

(λ), λ = (λ1, . . . , λm),

h

are deﬁned by the formula

λi1 · · · · · λih .

chτ m−h,

mXh=0

Using the deﬁnition of σ(m)

The next lemma plays a key role in Section 3.

38

CLAUDIA GARETTO AND CHRISTIAN J ¨AH

Lemma L.2. Let A ∈ Rm×m, then the following formulas hold true

(55)

(56)

det(A − A) = Am + c1Am−1 + · · · + cm−1A + cmIm = 0,
adj(A) = (−1)m−1(Am−1 + c1Am−2 + c2Am−3 + · · · + cm−1Im),

(57)

adj(Imτ − A) =

mXh=1" h−1Xh′=0

ch′ Ah−h′−1# τ m−h.

Note that formula (55) is just the well known Cayley-Hamilton theorem
(see for instance [14]). The other two formulas follow from a variant of its
proof.

Proof. We consider the product adj(Imτ − A)(Imτ − A). By Proposition
L.1, we have

(58)

adj(Imτ − A)(Imτ − A) = det(Imτ − A)Im

Since the entries of adj(Imτ − A) are all polynomials of order ≤ m − 1 in τ ,
we can collect the coeﬃcients in matrices and write

adj(Imτ − A) =

Bm−hτ m−h.

mXh=1

Plugging this into the left-hand-side of (58), we get

Bm−hτ m−h+1 −

m−1Xh=0

where we use (54). Thus,

Bm−hAτ m−h =

m−1Xh=0

chImτ m−h,

mXh=0

(59)

τ mBm−1 +

τ m−h(Bm−j−1 − Bm−hA) − B0A =

A comparison of the coeﬃcients leads to:

m−1Xh=1

chImτ m−h.

mXh=0

If one multiplies the coeﬃcients of τ m−h with Am−h for 0 ≤ h ≤ m and
sums them up for h from 0 to m, the sum over the middle column telescopes
and adds up to zero which proves (55). If we multiply the coeﬃcients of
τ m−h by Am−1−h for 0 ≤ h ≤ m − 1, we get, summing up over h from 0 to
m − 1 that the middle column telescopes and leaves B0. With the sum over
the right column, we obtain

B0 =

m−1Xh=0

chAm−1−h.

HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLICITIES

39

By the comparison of coeﬃcients, we obtained −B0A = −AB0 = cmIm =
(−1)m det(A)Im, where the second equal sign can be proven by reversing
the order of multiplication in (L.1). Thus, we have

adj(A) = (−1)m−1B0 = (−1)m−1

chAm−1−h.

m−1Xh=0

Hence, (56) is proven. Now we can obtain the Bi by multiplying the coef-
ﬁcients of τ m−h by Am−(i+1)−h for 0 ≤ h ≤ m − (i + 1) and summing the
equated middle and right column from 0 to m − (i + 1), we obtain

Bi =

and, thus,

adj(Imτ − A) =

chAm−(i+1)−h,

m−(i+1)Xh=0
mXh=1" h−1Xh′=0

ch′ Ah−h′−1# τ m−h

Hence we get (57) and the lemma is proven. (cid:4)

(cid:3)

Example L.1. We consider m = 2. From (57), we have

adj(I2τ − A(t, ξ)) =

2Xh=1" h−1Xh′=0

ch′Ah−h′−1# τ 2−h

= c0τ + (c0A + c1I2)τ 0 = I2τ − adj(A),

where we used the representation adj(A) = −(A − tr(A)I2) from formula
(56) and c1 = σ(2)
0 (λ) = 1. This also coincides with
our computations in Section 3.5.

1 (λ) = − tr(A), c0 = σ(2)

Example L.2. We consider m = 3. Now we get

adj(I3τ − A(t, ξ)) =

3Xh=1" h−1Xh′=0

ch′ Ah−h′−1# τ 3−h

= c0I3τ 2 + (c0A + c1I3)τ + (c0A2 + c1A + c2I3)τ 0
= I3τ2 + (A − tr(A)I3)τ + adj(A),

where we used adj(A) = A2 + c1A + c2I3 from (56) and the coeﬃcients of
the characteristic polynomial of A

c0 = 1,

c1 = − tr(A),

c2 = a11a22 + a11a33 + a22a33 − a12a21 − a13a31 − a23a32.

This result coincides with our computations in Section 3.6.
