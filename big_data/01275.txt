We present the ﬁrst complete MCMC analysis of cosmological models with evolving cosmic
(super)string networks, using the Unconnected Segment Model in the unequal-time correlator for-
malism. For ordinary cosmic string networks, we derive joint constraints on ΛCDM and string
network parameters, namely the string tension Gµ, the loop-chopping eﬃciency cr and the string
wiggliness α. For cosmic superstrings, we obtain joint constraints on the fundamental string tension
GµF, the string coupling gs, the self-interaction coeﬃcient cs, and the volume of compact extra di-
mensions w. This constitutes the most comprehensive CMB analysis of ΛCDM cosmology + strings
to date. For ordinary cosmic string networks our updated constraint on the string tension is, in
relativistic units, Gµ < 1.1 × 10−7, while for cosmic superstrings our constraint on the fundamental
string tension is GµF < 2.8 × 10−8, both obtained using Planck2015 temperature and polarisation
data.

INTRODUCTION

Cosmic strings are line-like concentrations of energy
that can arise as topological defects in theories of the
early Universe [1–5]. In particular, they form natu-
rally in models of hybrid inﬂation [6–12] in which the
inﬂationary phase ends with a second-order phase-
transition [7, 13–15]. Although they were originally
considered as an alternative candidate for providing
the seeds for structure formation in the Universe [16–
19], it is now understood that they cannot give rise
to the observed acoustic peak structure in the power
spectrum [20–24], but can play a subdominant role.
There are a wide range of potential observational sig-
natures of cosmic strings, for example line-like discon-
tinuities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature anisotropy via the Kaiser-Stebbins ef-
fect [25, 26]. Thus, strings provide a powerful tool for
testing theories of the early Universe. Observations
have strongly constrained the contribution of cosmic
strings to the total CMB anisotropy [20, 27–32]. Cur-
rent data places a 2σ upper bound on the string ten-
sion of Gµ < 1.3 × 10−7 for Nambu-Goto strings [33]
which corresponds to 1.1% of the total temperature
anisotropy at (cid:96) = 10. G is the gravitational constant,
µ is the tension of the string and c = 1 in relativis-
tic units. There is still constraining power left in the
data since strings generate speciﬁc signatures in the
primordial B-mode polarisation spectrum [27, 34–39],
which can now be analysed with the Planck2015 po-
larisation [40] and joint BICEP2 data [41].

Going beyond the simplest cosmic string models,
complex networks of multiple types of interacting su-
perstrings, each with a diﬀerent tension, can also
be considered. Notably, interacting networks of fun-
damental F-strings, one dimensional D-branes (D-
strings) and bound (FD) states between F- and D-
strings, collectively referred to as cosmic superstrings,

arise naturally in string theoretic inﬂation [7, 42].
These networks are notably diﬀerent to their sim-
pler, single-type string counterparts since the diﬀer-
ent string types have intercommutation probabilities
that are not necessarily unity [43–49]. The interac-
tions among diﬀerent string types are also much more
complex, as colliding strings can zip together or unzip,
producing heavier or lighter FD-string states carrying
diﬀerent charges. These features aﬀect CMB signa-
tures allowing us to obtain constraints on string the-
ory parameters such as the string coupling gs and the
fundamental string tension µF [50, 51].

In this paper we use the Planck2015 public data [40]
to perform the ﬁrst full Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analysis of ΛCDM models with cosmic
string or superstring networks. For “ordinary” cos-
mic string networks we work in the unconnected seg-
ment model (USM) framework and utilise our ana-
lytic method [52] for fast computation of the string
unequal-time correlator (UETC). This is used as a
source to compute CMB anisotropies and hence ob-
tain joint constraints on ΛCDM and the string net-
work parameters, including the tension Gµ, the loop
chopping eﬃciency cr and the wiggliness parameter
α. In the case of cosmic superstring networks we ex-
tend our method to deal with multiple network com-
ponents. The UETC approach is eﬃcient, meaning
we can compute the superstring spectrum in much
less time than previous codes and obtain joint con-
straints on the fundamental string tension GµF, the
string coupling constant gs, the self-interaction coeﬃ-
cient cs, and the parameter w of [51], quantifying the
volume of compact extra dimensions.

In Sec. II we describe the UETC formalism ap-
plied to evolving Nambu-Goto string networks.
In
Sec. III we summarise our modelling of cosmic su-
perstrings and the adaptation of our UETC method
to these multi-string component networks. In Sec. IV
we present the results of our MCMC analysis for cos-
mic string and superstring networks using Planck2015
CMB data. Our constraints on string network param-
eters and possible future directions are discussed in
Sec. V.

II. UNEQUAL-TIME CORRELATOR

Unlike passive inﬂationary perturbations which are
set as initial conditions, metric perturbations from
cosmic string networks are actively sourced at all
times. To compute the string spectra the compo-
nents of the string network’s energy momentum ten-
sor must be used as sources in the linearised Einstein-
Boltzmann equations. The relevant quantity to cal-
culate is the unequal-time correlator (UETC), whose
dominant eigenmodes, found by diagonalising, can be
used as source functions, each individual mode being
coherent [19]. The UETC

determines all the two-point correlation functions such
as the CMB temperature C(cid:96) and matter power spectra
P (k), deﬁned as in [53]. Indeed, integrating the UETC

A. String Energy-Momentum Tensor

Nambu-Goto strings are one-dimensional defects in
the zero-width limit and provide a good description
for cosmic strings, whose correlation length is many
orders of magnitude larger than their width. Their
motion in spacetime spans a two-dimensional surface,
the worldsheet xµ(σa), where the indices µ = 0, 1, 2, 3
label spacetime coordinates and a = 0, 1 are the in-
dices of coordinates on the worldsheet [54, 55]. The
worldsheet action is reparametrisation invariant and
a gauge can be chosen by imposing two conditions on
the spacetime coordinates xµ as functions of σa. In
an FRW background, a useful choice of gauge is such
that σ0 = τ , the conformal time, and x(cid:48)· ˙x = 0, where
˙ ≡ ∂/∂τ and (cid:48) ≡ ∂/∂σ, relabelling σ1, which in this
gauge is a spacelike worldsheet coordinate, as σ. In
this gauge the Nambu-Goto string energy-momentum
tensor is

(2.4)

Here, U is the string energy per unit length and T is
the string tension. For Nambu-Goto strings on arbi-
trarily small scales, Lorentz invariance requires that
T = U = µ. However, if we coarse-grain the string,
then the integrated eﬀect of small-scale structure is
to make the eﬀective tension smaller than the energy
density. We can then include the eﬀect of small-scale
wiggles on the string via a “string wiggliness” param-
eter α, such that

U = αµ and T =

B. Velocity Dependent One-Scale Model

The velocity one-scale model (VOS) equations dic-
tate the values of the string network correlation length
L, and the average velocity v, of string segments in
the network [56]. The correlation length L is the av-
erage length of string segments which, for scaling net-
works (that have a random walk structure), is also
equal to the average string separation. The network
velocity v, is the root-mean-square (RMS) velocity of
these correlation-length-sized string segments. The
macroscopic evolution equations for these network pa-
rameters can be derived from the Nambu-Goto action
by applying a statistical averaging procedure over the
string worldsheet [57–59]. Expressed in terms of the
physical time t they read:

where ˙a(t)/a(t) is the Hubble function and ˙ ≡ d/dt
stands for diﬀerentiation with respect to physical
time, unlike in equation (2.4). The loop chopping eﬃ-
ciency parameter cr, quantiﬁes the energy loss due to
loop production and ˜k provides a phenomenological
description of the small-scale structure on the string,

and matter eras respectively. Note in the scaling so-
lutions of (2.20) the implicit velocity dependence of
˜k through equation (2.16). Earlier implementations
of the cosmic defect CMB code CMBACT [60] used two
sets of values for the loop chopping eﬃciency and the
parameter ˜k in the scaling solutions (2.20) for the
radiation and matter eras. These values were then
interpolated between for the transition between the
radiation and matter eras. However, in the latest im-
plementation of the VOS equations in CMBACT4 [61],
the velocity dependence of ˜k is explicitly used and the
loop chopping eﬃciency is kept constant throughout
both epochs [59]. Here, we also adopt this approach:
at any particular τ , the values of ξ and v found us-
ing the VOS equations (2.17-2.18) are used for cal-
culating the UETC, keeping cr constant throughout
and explicitly accounting for the velocity dependence
(2.16) of ˜k. In earlier versions of CMBACT the wiggli-
ness α, was also an evolving parameter, but it is now
kept constant in CMBACT4, which is the approach we
take here. The evolution of the network parameters
can be seen for a range of cr in Fig. 1 showing that
a wide range of correlation lengths and velocities are
available. Detailed comparison of the VOS model with
Nambu-Goto simulations of ordinary string networks
(i.e. single string type with unit intercommuting prob-
ability [62]) determine the loop chopping eﬃciency to
cr = 0.23 ± 0.04 [59], corresponding to the black dot-
dashed curves in Fig. 1. Models of cosmic superstrings
generally have suppressed intercommutation probabil-
ities [43–46], which eﬀectively reduces cr and so they
correspond to the green curves in the ﬁgure. Such net-
works have relativistic velocities v ∼ 1/
2 and cor-
relation lengths much smaller than the horizon, cor-
responding to a much higher string number density
compared to ordinary string networks. However, they
also have smaller string tension so their overall eﬀect
on the CMB can be small, consistent with the data.

C. Unconnected Segment Model

where β is the physical time FRW expansion exponent

Simulations of evolving string networks are numer-
ically very expensive. Strings decay as 1/(ξτ )3, even-
tually reaching a scaling solution (ξ = constant) with

1011001011021031040.50.60.70.00.10.20.30.4a number density of tens to hundreds of strings per
horizon volume. At early times, the box contains a
huge number of strings whose dynamics and inter-
actions have to be tracked at each time step. The
unconnected segment model (USM) [21, 60] dramati-
cally reduces the required computational resources by
approximating the string network as a collection of
correlation-length-sized segments, with the time evo-
lution of the correlation length and segment veloc-
ity described by the VOS equations. Moreover, the
model consolidates these string segments by collect-
ing all strings that decay between any two times, and
so fewer strings need to be tracked. The number of
strings that decay between any two conformal times
is

Nd(τi) = V [n(τi−1) − n(τi)] ,

(2.21)

where n(τ ) is the number density of strings at confor-
mal time τ , given by n(τ ) = C(τ )/(ξτ )3. The factor
C(τ ) is chosen so as to keep the number of strings
at any time proportional to 1/(ξτ )3. The energy-
momentum tensor for the string network is then given
by the sum over the total number of consolidated
string segments K , with a factor accounting for string
decay

The string decay factor T oﬀ (τ, τi, Lf ) is a function in-
terpolating between 1 and 0 and is responsible for
turning oﬀ the contribution of the ith consolidated
segment after the time it has decayed. Its steepness
is controlled by a string decay parameter 0 < Lf ≤ 1,
as follows:

T oﬀ (τ, τi, Lf ) =

Thus,
tor T oﬀ (τ, τi, Lf ) approaches a Heaviside function,
sharply switching oﬀ the contribution of the ith con-
solidated segment to the network energy-momentum
tensor for times τ > τi.

The Lf Parameter

Since the number of consolidated segments also sets
the number of decay epochs, a ﬁnite number of con-
solidated segments leads to discrete steps in the num-
ber density of strings. The string decay parameter Lf
was introduced to allow a fraction of the consolidated
strings to decay before the end of their respective de-
cay epoch, thus making the number density evolution
smoother. The function C(τ ) was also introduced
to ensure that the number of strings at any confor-
mal time τ is kept proportional to (ξτ )−3. However,

4

one consequence of Lf < 1 is that it is possible that
Lf τi+1 < τi, meaning strings can start to decay earlier
than their respective epoch and the number density is
systematically lower.

In the CMBACT4 implementation we have found that
changing the number of consolidated segments from
200 to 10000 has very little impact on the string spec-
tra, as shown in Fig. 2. However, the amplitude of
the C(cid:96) is dependent on the value of Lf . The change
is scale dependent, but can be as much as 30%, for
example near the peak of the scalar temperature sig-
nal. Previous analyses which have used the results
from CMBACT have overlooked this dependence. Al-
though not entirely degenerate with the amplitude of
C(cid:96), which scales proportional to (Gµ)2, it will clearly
have some aﬀect on the inferred values of Gµ from
the USM. We compare this to our approach in the
following section.

Inﬁnite Consolidated String Segments

We are able to accommodate a large number of seg-
ments analytically. As discussed in [52], the scaling
factor, that weights the UETC taking into account
string decay, has a particularly simple form when the
number of consolidated string segments tends to in-
ﬁnity, Lf → 1 and C(τ ) → 1. This is

f (τ1, τ2, ξ) =

Nd(τi)T oﬀ (τ1, τi, Lf )
× T oﬀ (τ2, τi, Lf ),

= (ξ(Max[τ1, τ2])Max[τ1, τ2])−3. (2.25)

An analytic expression for the scaling factor can also
be found for arbitrary Lf using the form of Toﬀ quoted
in equation (2.23). However, it seems natural to con-
sider only the case Lf = 1 when the number of con-
solidated string segments is very large.
In the inﬁ-
nite limit the segments will decay at an inﬁnite num-
ber of epochs which are inﬁnitesimally separated, a
continuous limit in which the string number density
is smooth. We have shown that the number density
scales according to (ξτ )−3 with our approach. While
inﬁnite consolidated segments may seem unphysical,
it is just a limit used to obtain the correct scaling rela-
tion. We obtain very similar results to CMBACT4 when
using between 200 to 10000 segments with Lf = 1.
The issue of whether Lf < 1, and the resulting mod-
iﬁcation of scaling from early string decay, is physi-
cal and requires further investigation. Ultimately, the
USM is a simpliﬁed model which aims to match the
UETC from simulations by adjusting the network pa-
rameters. Overall it has been shown to match Nambu-
Goto simulations well [63]. However, due to the cor-
relation between the inferred values for Gµ for a given
Lf , this issue should be considered more closely.

Since the number density scales according to (ξτ )−3
using our approach we believe this to be reasonable,
and will adopt this for the comparison to data.

D. Analytic Calculation of the Unequal-Time

Correlator

The UETC can be computed analytically [52] by
integrating over all string conﬁgurations (orientations
and positions) in the network. For the two point cor-

lational invariance implies k1 = −k2 = k and so
χ1 = −χ2 = χ. Considering that, due to equations
(2.6) and (2.10), Θ(τ, k, χ) is a symmetric function of
k the integral is

Without loss of generality k can be chosen to lie along
the k3-axis, such that k = kˆk3. Θ here represents
each of Θ00, ΘS, ΘV and ΘT of equations (2.11-2.13).
The φ, ψ and χ integrals can be done analytically in

this case leaving only the θ integral in terms of Bessel
functions. The UETC can then be written as the sum
over six integral identities

with x1,2 = kξ(τ1,2)τ1,2. Here x1,2 means x1 or x2
respectively. This extends the corresponding result of
[52] in that ξ and v are now functions of τ instead
of being kept constant. This means that the expres-
sions of the amplitudes Ai, presented in Table II, are
now time-dependent. The integral identities (shown
in Table I) remain the same. It should be noted that
I1(x, ) and I4(x, ) diverge but the combination of

large kτ1 ≈ kτ2 (corresponding to the top right corner
of Fig. 3 or Fig. 4) there is a ringing pattern with suc-
cessive positive and negative peaks that decay as we
move away from the diagonal. These oscillatory pat-
terns are a consequence of causality [21, 65, 66], built
into the USM model: as the correlator must vanish
at superhorizon scales (in fact in the USM model it
vanishes at scales larger than the correlation length,
which is smaller than the horizon), this introduces a
sharp edge in physical space that becomes oscillatory
in Fourier space. The Gaussian model assigns non-
zero values to the correlator at superhorizon scales
and so this causal oscillatory feature is absent from
the UETC in that model.

E. Eigenmode Decomposition

√
The UETC is generally rescaled by a factor of
τ1τ2, which, for ξ and v constant, makes it a function
of kτ1 and kτ2 only. This is not true in the present case
because now we are tracking the time-dependence of ξ
and v, so the UETC depends separately on k, τ1 and
τ2. However, it is still useful to introduce this rescaling
in order to facilitate direct comparison of the UETC
with previous results. This rescaled UETC can then
be discretised onto a logarithmic grid in kτ1 and kτ2
with n × n grid points and then diagonalised giving
the eigenvectors and eigenvalues

(k2τ1τ2)γ√

τ1τ2(cid:104)Θ(τ1, k)Θ(τ2, k)(cid:105) =

N(cid:88)

λiui(kτ1) ⊗ ui(kτ2).

(2.32)

i=1

Due to the explicit dependence on k, this diagonalisa-
tion procedure has to be repeated for a large number
of k-modes, and the eigenvalues are k-dependent. This
signiﬁcantly increases the computation time compared
to [52]. The extra factor (k2τ1τ2)γ is used for more
eﬃcient reconstruction of the UETC when the eigen-
modes are truncated below n. The choice γ = 0.25
gives the best reconstruction on scales that give the
dominant contribution to the CMB anisotropies.

There is no correlation between the scalar, vector
and tensor modes and so the vector and tensor UETC
can be diagonalised independently. However, the den-
sity Θ00, and scalar anisotropic stress ΘS, are corre-
lated. The diagonalisation is done over a 2n× 2n grid
constructed from

(2.31)
The form of B and C are similar to [52] but again de-
pend on the values of v and ξ at τ1 and τ2. These coef-
ﬁcients have also been included in Table II. Thanks to
these analytic approximations, computational times
can be greatly reduced compared to the case where
the integral identities Ii are used for computation over
the whole range of kτ1, kτ2. The regions where these
approximations are valid are shown in Fig. 3, only the
white region is computationally intensive. It should
be noted that, because ξ is a function of time, the
shape of the approximated regions in Fig. 3 changes
for diﬀerent values of k and so we must consider a
large number of k-modes when computing the UETC.
This is in contrast to [52], where the approximation
of constant ξ and v meant that the UETC was only a
function of the combinations kτ1 and kτ2.

Negative values of the UETC

It has been noted in [64] that there are negative
regions in the string UETC calculated analytically
through our formalism, which do not appear in the
Gaussian model for the string UETC used in [64].
These can be seen in Fig. 4.

There are two distinct types of regions with nega-
tive values of our UETC. First, regions with small kτ1
and large kτ2 (and vice versa), corresponding to the
top left and bottom right corners of Fig. 3 or Fig. 4:
in these regions the UETC should be zero, but small
negative (and positive) values can arise from the ﬁ-
nite order truncation of the Bessel series expansions
of I1(x±, ρ) and I4(x±, ρ) in Eq. (2.27). These values

anisotropic stress. The diagonalisation creates orthog-
onal eigenvectors which are then used as source terms
in the CAMB [67] linear Einstein-Boltzmann code. The
C(cid:96) are calculated using each individual eigenvector
τ (kτ )γ), as a source function C i
ui(kτ )/(
(cid:96), which can
be summed to give the total power spectra

√

C(cid:96) =

λiC i
(cid:96).

(2.34)

i=1

By ordering λi from largest to smallest, the required
accuracy in the C(cid:96) can be achieved by including rela-
tively few eigenmodes. This can be seen in the middle
row of Fig. 5 where there is only about 10% diﬀerence
between using all 512 eigenmodes of a 512 × 512 grid
compared to only using 32 eigenmodes when ﬁxing the
value of Gµ. Also, it can be seen in the top row of
Fig. 5 that reducing the grid resolution reduces the
amplitude of the C(cid:96). A grid resolution of 128 × 128 is
about 5% lower, on average, than using the 512× 512
grid but convergence times decrease drastically.
It
should be noted that there is negligible diﬀerence be-
tween using a 512×512 and a 1024×1024 grid meaning
that the former is reliably giving the full C(cid:96) contri-
bution. The bottom row shows what happens when
using more k values in the calculation. Wiggly fea-
tures arise from using too few k values and can be
removed at the expense of a much longer calculation.
Using these ﬁndings we can choose the optimal UETC
parameters to give good quality C(cid:96) in a reasonable
amount of time. The resulting spectra obtained from
our analytical method are shown in Fig. 2 in yellow
dashed curves and agree well with USM string real-
isations, especially in the limit of large numbers of
simulated segments.

In Fig. 6 we compare our temperature power spec-
trum (normalised at (cid:96) = 10) to that of CMBACT4 [60],
Nambu-Goto simulations [63], and Abelian-Higgs sim-
ulations [68]. Both CMBACT4 and our method use the
same velocity dependent one-scale model parameters,
but CMBACT4 uses Lf = 0.5. The Nambu-Goto sim-
ulations are performed in an expanding background
from recombination to today,
including Λ domina-
tion. Large loops are kept in the simulation and con-
tribute to the total energy-momentum tensor of the
network, but these simulations cannot resolve small-
scale physics near the string width and do not include
the eﬀects of radiation backreaction.
In contrast,
the Abelian-Higgs simulations can resolve small-scale
structure and radiative eﬀects. However, they suf-
fer from issues in dynamical range and cannot evolve
through the radiation-matter transition, so the UETC
is instead interpolated.

Overall, the four spectra agree reasonably well. The
USM variants (CMBACT4 and our approach) both pre-
dict slightly more power at the peak than either of
the simulations. The Nambu simulations predict more
power on very small scales, around twice as much
as the Abelian-Higgs model.
It is well known that
Nambu-Goto calculations yield higher string densi-
ties than ﬁeld theoretic ones, which will increase their
overall normalisation. The resulting constraints on

(3. bottom row) when the accuracy boost setting of CAMB is decreased, reducing the number of k values.

tal building blocks for these networks are light (fun-
damental) F-strings and heavier (Dirichlet) D-strings,
with a tension hierarchy controlled by the fundamen-
tal string coupling [69–71]. Heavier strings arise as
bound states between p F-strings and q D-strings,
where p,q are coprime. Given the fundamental string
tension, the corresponding tensions of these heavier
(p, q)-strings are controlled mainly by p,q and the
value of the string coupling. These networks gener-
ally behave very diﬀerently than their ordinary cosmic
string counterparts. They are typically characterised
by small intercommutation probabilities, thus leading
to higher string number densities [43, 47, 48, 51]. The
complex interactions present imply that several string
types with diﬀerent tensions and correlation lengths
can simultaneously contribute to the string network
CMB spectra.

In scaling superstring networks, the string number
density is dominated by the lightest F-strings, fol-
lowed by D-strings and the ﬁrst bound state, i.e. (1,1)-
strings. Heavier bound states are suppressed, so the
number of string types considered in the model can be
truncated at a ﬁnite number. Following [51] we shall
describe the network by keeping seven distinct types
of strings:

FIG. 6: Comparison of approaches to string modelling,
normalising the temperature power spectrum at (cid:96) = 10.
We compare our approach (in green) to CMBACT4 [60],
Nambu-Goto simulations [63], and Abelian-Higgs simula-
tions [68] (in blue, red and light blue respectively).

Gµ are therefore around a factor of 50% lower [33].
The USM variants are closer to the Nambu-Goto sim-
ulations in this respect [63]. Also, as we have shown,
there is some additional uncertainty in the USM as the
normalisation depends somewhat on the choice of Lf .
In summary, given the large diﬀerence in modelling
between the various approaches we ﬁnd this compar-
ison encouraging, although more work is needed to
further delineate the diﬀerences.

III. COSMIC SUPERSTRINGS

A cosmic superstring network can be modelled as
a collection of string segments of diﬀerent types,
each string type having its own tension and self-
intercommuting probability [43–49, 51]. Strings of dif-
ferent types interact with each other via “zipping” or
“unzipping” leading to heavier or lighter strings re-
spectively, that are connected to the original strings
at trilinear Y-shaped junctions [69]. The fundamen-

the corresponding string type.

The large-scale dynamics is then modelled by seven
copies of the VOS equations, appropriately extended
to account for transfer of energy among the diﬀerent
string types through zipping and unzipping interac-
tions [48, 49]. In each copy of the VOS equations de-
scribing a single string, say of type i, the self interac-
tion coeﬃcient cr in equation (2.17) is replaced by the
corresponding self-interaction coeﬃcient ci, and new
cross-interaction terms with coeﬃcients dk
ij are added
to describe zipping and unzipping. The coeﬃcients ci,
dk
ij are controlled by the corresponding microphysical
intercommuting probabilities Pij [51]. These micro-
physical probabilities Pij can be estimated [44, 46]
from the corresponding string theoretic amplitudes
(and ﬁeld theory approximations in the case of non-
perturbative interactions between heavy strings [45]).
They can be expressed as a product of two pieces: one
that is dependent on the volume of the compact ex-
tra dimensions Vij(w, gs), and a quantum interaction
piece Fij(v, θ, gs). Physically, one can think of Vij as
arising from string position ﬂuctuations around the
minimum of a localising potential well, giving rise to
an eﬀective volume seen by each type of string. The
heavier the string the smaller the ﬂuctuations are and
so the smaller the value of Vij [44]. The parameter
w corresponds to the eﬀective volume in the compact
extra dimensions seen by F-strings. gs is the funda-
mental string coupling and v and θ are the relative
velocity and angle of the incoming strings. For a pair
of strings colliding at an angle θ, and relative speed v,
the intercommuting probability is

Pij(v, θ, w, gs) = Fij(v, θ, gs)Vij(w, gs).

(3.2)
Details of how Fij and Vij are calculated can be
found in [51]. Since the network contains a large
number of individual strings with a range of veloci-
ties and orientations, the coeﬃcients ci and dk
ij are
determined by the integral of Pij over a Gaussian

9

velocity distribution centred on the scaling network
velocities of each string type and over all angles.
This gives the average intercommuting probabilities
Pij(w, gs) ≡ Pij. Numerical simulations of single-type
Nambu-Goto strings with small intercommuting prob-
ability [47] suggest that the self-interaction coeﬃcients
ci scale as:

ci = cs × P 1/3

For cross-interactions between two strings of types

is an additional factor arising from the kinematic con-

C(cid:96) are read into COSMOMC, interpolated at the MCMC
cr and α values and then scaled by (Gµ)2. This is
an extremely eﬃcient way for obtaining network con-
straints since only the ΛCDM C(cid:96) need to be calcu-
lated, while the interpolation takes very little time.
We have checked that the diﬀerence in the resulting
string C(cid:96) when calculated at the upper and lower 3σ
bounds in Ωbh2, Ωch2 and H0 is ∼ 0.5% in the temper-
ature, E- and B-modes and no more than∼ 10% in the
TE cross-correlation. This uncertainty is very small
in comparison with the size of the string C(cid:96) relative
to the ΛCDM C(cid:96) and as such justiﬁes this method.
The C(cid:96) for diﬀerent cr and α are plotted in Fig. 8.
The diﬀerent bands of colour indicate the value of
cr, red being the lowest (cr = 0.1) then progressing
through pink, purple, dark blue, blue, light blue, dark
green, green, yellow and grey in steps of 0.1, up to
cr = 1. The upper and lower edges of the bands indi-
cate α = 10 and α = 1 respectively. From this it can
be seen that the eﬀect of α is to change the ampli-
tude of the C(cid:96), with lower α also ﬂattening the small
(cid:96) features (as best seen in the second column and to a
lesser extent in the third column of Fig. 8). Increasing
cr reduces the amplitude of the C(cid:96) and, as best seen
in the third column of Fig. 8, shifts the main peak to-
wards slightly smaller (cid:96). In the second method, which
is computationally expensive, we simply calculate the
string and ΛCDM C(cid:96) for each (network) parameter
value and compare to CMB data.

The same process of pre-calculating string spectra
can be done for cosmic superstring networks in the
parameter ranges cs = [0.1, 1], gs = [0.01, 0.9] and
w = [0.001, 1]. The superstring C(cid:96) can be seen in
Fig. 9, where same colours are used for the steps
in cs as in Fig. 8. The bands indicate values of w,
with w = 10−3 corresponding to the lower bound and
w = 1 to the upper bound. The rows indicate varying
values of gs, with gs = 0.01, gs = 0.1 and gs = 0.9 for
the top, middle and bottom rows respectively. The
ﬁrst point to notice is that the C(cid:96) amplitudes at low
gs are much greater than those at large gs. For large
cs values there is less diﬀerence between the greatest
and smallest values of w, especially at low gs. This
is because the cross-interaction terms dk
ij, are less de-
pendent on w than the self-interaction terms ci. As
cs only inﬂuences ci and not dk
ij, then at low cs values
dk
ij have more eﬀect on the C(cid:96) amplitudes, leading to
a stronger dependence on w.

The datasets used in the MCMC analysis come
from the Planck2015 mission [40],
in particular:
Planck2015 TT+lowP: This contains the 100-GHz,
143-GHz, and 217-GHz binned half-mission TT cross-
spectra for (cid:96) = 30− 2508 with CMB-cleaned 353-GHz
map, CO emission maps, and Planck catalogues for
the masks and 545-GHz maps for the dust residual
contamination template.
It also uses the joint tem-
perature, E and B cross-spectra for (cid:96) = 2 − 29 with
E and B maps from the 70-GHz LFI full mission data
and foreground contamination determined by 30-GHz
LFI and 353-GHz HFI maps.
Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP: This contains the

FIG. 7: The velocity v, and correlation length ξ, for the
F-string in black, D-string in blue and FD-string in red.
These results are obtained when gs = 0.3, w = 1 and cs =
0.23 and evolution into a dark energy regime is ignored.

here we take bi

ab = 0.

Once the velocities and correlation lengths of all
string types in the network are obtained by solv-
ing (3.6-3.7), their unequal-time correlators can be
calculated independently as laid out in Sec. II. Al-
though N > 3 string types are needed in order to
accurately construct the abundances of the domi-
nant three lighter strings (in this case seven string
types are used (3.1)), the resulting scaling densities
of the higher charged states with N > 3 are strongly
suppressed compared to the lighter F-, D- and FD-
strings [48, 49, 74]. This allows us to only consider
these ﬁrst three states in the computation of CMB
signatures through our UETC analytic method. The
evolution of the network parameters for the three
lightest strings can be seen in Fig. 7 for cs = 0.23,
w = 1 and gs = 0.3.

Once the UETC of each of the three lighter strings
are calculated they can simply be summed to give the
total string UETC, since the individual segments are
uncorrelated in the USM model. This can then be di-
agonalised and the eigenvectors and eigenmodes used
as sources for ﬁnding the contribution from cosmic su-
perstrings to the CMB anisotropy. We have checked
that our analytic UETC method reproduces the re-
sults of Fig. 4 in [51], including the shift in the location
of the peak as we vary gs. We have found a slightly
lower amplitude in the B-mode spectrum that can be
attributed to the extra factor of 2 in the vector modes
that was present in CMBACT3 (which [51] was based on)
and has been corrected in CMBACT4 [75].

IV. STRING CONSTRAINTS

We obtain joint constraints on cosmic string net-
work and ΛCDM parameters using a modiﬁed version
of COSMOMC. To reduce computational time in our anal-
ysis we have tested two methods for deriving string
network constraints. In the ﬁrst method, the string
C(cid:96) are pre-calculated for a range of cr = [0.1, 1] and
α = [1, 10] at the Planck best ﬁt values for the cos-
mological parameters, i.e. Ωbh2, Ωch2 and H0. These

same data as Planck2015 TT+lowP but also uses the
TE and EE cross-spectra for (cid:96) = 30 − 1996.
Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP+BKPlanck: This
again contains all of the data used in Planck2015
TT+Pol+lowP but includes also the cross-frequency
spectra between BICEP2/Keck maps at 150 GHz and
Planck maps at 353 GHz including the B-mode spec-
tra at multipoles (cid:96) ∼ 50 − 250.

We ﬁrst consider our interpolation method, where
the C(cid:96) are pre-calculated on a grid in cr and α (or
in the case of cosmic superstring networks cs, gs and
w), and then a spline interpolation used between grid
values. The results obtained from this method are
very quick and accurate due to our ability to use all
512 eigenmodes of the 512 × 512 grid for the UETC.
The constraints on network parameters derived from
this method are shown in Fig. 10. Gµ is implemented
into the MCMC analysis through a logarithmic prior
of [−10,−5] such that Gµ = 10[−10,−5].

There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in our constraints
when using Planck2015 TT+lowP, or including EE

and TE or both EE and TE and BB results. The up-
per 2σ value for the tension is Gµ < 1.1 × 10−7 for
Planck2015 TT and is similarly Gµ < 9.6 × 10−8 and
Gµ < 8.9 × 10−8 for Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP and
Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP+BKPlanck. These agree
well with the Gµ < 1.8 × 10−7 and Gµ < 1.3 × 10−7
from the Planck cosmological parameters analysis [33].
The slightly tighter constraints obtained here are due
to the amplitude of the C(cid:96) not scaling with the value of
Lf , i.e. the C(cid:96) are larger when Lf = 1 as assumed here,
while previous results were obtained from CMBACT with
Lf = 0.5. There is little diﬀerence between using the
Planck temperature data alone and including polari-
sation data as expected from [33]. As can be seen in
the other two columns of Fig. 10, cr and α are not
constrained. There is a slight preference for higher
values of cr and lower values of α since both of these
lead to smaller C(cid:96). Features, such as the position of
the main peak or the pronounced lower (cid:96) peak make
very little diﬀerence to the overall constraints. There
is a very slight correlation between Gµ and cr and
anti-correlation between Gµ and α, as expected from
the C(cid:96) seen in Fig. 8. A combination of high α and

Considering our direct calculation method, where
the string spectra are calculated every time along
with the C(cid:96) from ΛCDM, the constraints are slightly
weaker. This is because there is a pay-oﬀ between the
resolution of the UETC and number of eigenmodes
used in the reconstruction and the time spent com-
puting the spectra. To eﬃciently calculate the con-
straints a grid resolution of 128 × 128 with 64 eigen-
modes has been used. As can be seen in Fig. 5 we
expect a reduction in power of about 10 − 20% which
means the value of Gµ is allowed to be higher than
when the high resolution, full reconstruction interpo-
lation method is used. For Planck2015 TT+lowP this
is Gµ < 4.3 × 10−7. The constraints on cr and α also
show a slight preference for lower cr and larger α, as
in our interpolation method.

For cosmic superstrings, GµF, gs and w are
marginalised over logarithmic priors, and cs over a
ﬂat prior. Again all 512 eigenmodes of the 512 × 512
grid for the UETC are used. The likelihood contours
obtained from our interpolation method can be found
in Fig. 11. It can be seen that w and cs are almost
ﬂat (columns 3 and 4), again with larger values of cs
favoured as this leads to smaller amplitude C(cid:96). As
the string density grows with decreasing gs, the con-
straints on gs favour larger values, as seen in the sec-
ond column. Note, however, that the model is not re-
liable for large values of gs as the perturbative expan-
sion starts to break down and the string interaction
amplitudes used in ci and dk
ij have large uncertain-
ties. Finally, the ﬁrst column shows our constraints
on the fundamental string tension GµF, which is much
smaller than for ordinary cosmic strings. We ﬁnd
GµF < 2.8 × 10−8 for Planck2015 TT+lowP, and the
same constraint for Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP and
Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP+BKPlanck.

Also in Fig. 11 we show the constraints when us-
ing the direct calculation method, where the string
spectra are calculated at every step in the Markov
chain. This is a much more intensive computation
and so a lower resolution grid and fewer eigenmodes
in the reconstruction had to be used. As for cosmic
strings the optimal balance between computing time
and accuracy suggested using a 128× 128 grid with 64
eigenmodes. The constraints are thus slightly weaker,
with the main result GµF < 4.2 × 10−8. The results
from our two methods are in good agreement, justify-
ing the use of our interpolation method, and showing
that varying ΛCDM parameters within Planck priors
has little eﬀect on the string constraints.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Currently, there are two main approaches to the de-
tection of cosmic strings. Firstly, since they actively
generate scalar, vector and tensor perturbations they
lead to signatures in the temperature, polarisation,
and non-Gaussian spectra of the CMB. Secondly, a

12

cosmic string network will emit gravitational waves,
primarily from loop decay. This leads to a stochas-
tic background which can be constrained using pul-
sar timing, laser interferometry experiments such as
LIGO and eLISA, and also the CMB [76]. A tran-
sient gravitational wave signal is also expected from
cusps and kinks in the network [77]. The latter class
of tests has the potential to provide even stronger con-
straints on the string tension Gµ, but there are large
uncertainties in the loop size, which is ﬁxed by grav-
itational back-reaction.
It is therefore important to
use a variety of complementary observational probes.

The ﬁrst class of tests also suﬀer from uncertain-
ties, but these are less signiﬁcant. The string UETC
can be obtained from simulations and used as source
functions in CMB codes, but simulations are numer-
ically expensive and suﬀer from issues in dynamical
range. An alternative approach is to model the string
network as an ensemble of segments using the USM.
Crucially, although the USM provides a simpliﬁed pic-
ture of the network, it is able to match simulations by
adjusting the free parameters of the model, namely
the correlation length, RMS velocity and string wig-
gliness.

In this paper we have signiﬁcantly improved and
extended our previous work on string power spectra
from the USM:

1. We have analytically solved the UETC for an
evolving string network, whereas our previous
work was restricted to constant network param-
eters. The UETC itself can be computed in
under a minute. For the CMB power spec-
trum, although the time taken is increased due
to tracking a larger number of Fourier modes,
on a 3.1 GHz Intel Xeon CPU with 8 threads,
our code runs in ∼ 60 minutes. For comparison,
around 2000 network realisations are required
for CMBACT4 to achieve the same accuracy and
since this code is serial, the computation time is
∼ 30 hours.

2. We have extended the formalism to cosmic su-
perstring networks with multiple string types
and diﬀerent network parameters. Here the
UETC can be computed for each string type
and added, since the segments are assumed to
be uncorrelated. The UETC calculation is much
quicker than the CMB line-of-sight integration,
so the total computation time is not signiﬁcantly
increased over the single string case.

3. For

the ﬁrst

time we have been able to
marginalise over the string network parameters
when ﬁtting to Planck2015 and joint Planck-
BICEP2 data. The data is consistent with
no strings for both the single and multi-string
case. Since other network parameters are un-
constrained when the tension is very small, it
is only possible to present joint constraints on
these with Gµ. In the superstring case, for ex-
ample, the constraint on the string coupling gs
is degenerate with Gµ.

ange line shows the constraints from Planck2015 TT+lowP, purple and blue lines are used for Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP
and Planck2015 TT+Pol+lowP+BKPlanck respectively. The black dashed line shows the direct calculation constraints
for Planck2015 TT+lowP.

There are several possibilities to explore in future
work. Firstly, there are various ways in which the
USM could be improved. Superstring networks con-
tain Y-type junctions, but in the present formulation
these only impact the evolution of the network pa-
rameters. Since junctions are relatively rare in the
limit of large and small coupling, the USM is expected
to provide a suﬃcient description. However, in some
regimes the energy density of the network may not be
dominated by a single string type, and junctions may
become important.
In this case the USM could be
modiﬁed to include a correlation between segments.
A further improvement is the inclusion of loops. The
decay of string segments in the USM should mimic the
energy loss in loops, but it is possible these may lead
to additional interesting signatures.

Given that Planck has largely exhausted the avail-
able signal in the temperature data, future string con-
straints from the CMB will be driven by polarisa-
tion and non-Gaussianity. The non-Gaussian signal
from post-recombination simulations has been used
to obtain constraints on Gµ [32], and attempts have
been made to compute the bi-spectrum analytically
using a Gaussian model for the string correlators [78].
It is also possible to compute the non-Gaussian sig-
nal using the USM which will, by design,
include
physics from recombination and along the line-of-

sight. This has already been demonstrated for the
CMB bi-spectrum [79] by performing many realisa-
tions of the network. It is possible to employ a simi-
lar analytic method used in this work to compute the
string bi- and tri-spectrum, which we would expect to
be signiﬁcantly faster.

The detection of gravitational waves by LIGO is
particularly exciting for strings, and the next genera-
tion of ground and space based experiments can po-
tentially provide much stronger limits than those from
the CMB. However, these limits strongly depend on
modelling, for example, the loop, kink and cusp dis-
tribution. Further work is needed to understand these
and until then the CMB will continue to be an impor-
tant tool in the search for strings.
