Abstract

We present few types of integral transforms and integral representations that are very useful

for extending to supergeometry many familiar concepts of diﬀerential geometry. Among them

we discuss the construction of the super Hodge dual, the integral representation of picture

changing operators of string theories and the construction of the super-Liouville form of a

symplectic supermanifold.

Introduction

Pursuing the construction of supersymmetric Lagrangians based in the framework of super-

manifold geometry, we proposed in [1] a new Hodge operator (cid:63) acting on (super)diﬀerential

forms. For that aim, we have discussed a complete formalism (integral-, pseudo- e super-

forms, their complexes and the integration theory) in a series of papers [1, 2, 3] together with

a suitable Hodge operator. As a byproduct, this mathematical tool sheds also a new light on

the Hodge operator in conventional diﬀerential geometry.

The Hodge operator plays an essential role in diﬀerential geometry, yielding a fundamental
relation between the exterior bundle Ω•(M ) of diﬀerential forms and the scalar product (•,•)
on the manifold. The construction requires the existence of a metric g on the the manifold
M and is an involutive operation (cid:63) which satisﬁes the linearity condition (cid:63)(f ω) = f (cid:63) ω with
ω a given p-form of Ω•(M ).

In the case of supermanifolds (we refer for ex. to [1] for the basic ingredients of superge-

ometry; see also [4] for a recent extensive review), the deﬁnition of the Hodge dual turns out

to be harder than expected since one has to deal with the inﬁnite-dimensional complexes of

superforms. The integral forms and pseudo-forms are crucial to establish the correct matching

of elements between the diﬀerent spaces of forms. This new type of diﬀerential forms requires

the enlargement of the conventional space spanned by the fundamental 1-forms, admitting

distribution-like expressions (essentially, Dirac delta functions and Heaviside step functions).

This has triggered us to consider the Fourier analysis for diﬀerential forms (this was earlier

considered in [5] and [6]), and leads to an integral representation of the Hodge operator as

explained in [1, 3]. Such a representation can ﬁrst be established in the case of a conventional

manifold M without any reference to supermanifolds, except for the notion of Berezin inte-

gral. A new set of anticommuting variables playing the role of dual variables to fundamental

1-forms dxi is introduced and the Hodge operator is deﬁned by a suitable Berezin integration

on the new variables. The result is proven to coincide with the usual Hodge operator. When

extended to supermanifolds, our construction yields a “good” deﬁnition of Hodge operator,

satisfying all desired properties. Note that our ﬁberwise integral transform maps superforms

1

into integral forms showing that the latter are fundamental ingredients for the Hodge theory

in supermanifolds.

In the case of supermanifolds Voronov and Zorich studied in [5] a diﬀerent type of ﬁberwise

integral transform, that in the purely bosonic setting (usual diﬀerential forms) also gives the

usual Hodge dual. Their transform maps usual diﬀerential forms deﬁned on the parity reversed

(i.e. even) normal bundle of the reduced bosonic manifold (embedded into the supermanifold

setting to zero the anticommuting coordinates) to pseudoforms on the odd normal bundle.

Depending on the nature of the forms transformed, in this setting the pseudoforms obtained

are very general: polynomial and analytic forms in the commuting diﬀerentials and even

distribution-like forms.

This type of transform is not suitable for extending the Hodge dual but it is very interesting

because, in modern string theory language, it is strictly related to (the integral representation

of) the picture changing operators.

As is well known, in conventional Fourier analysis, the Fourier transform of a product of

two functions is the convolution integral of the Fourier transform of the two functions. In

a reciprocal way, the Fourier transform of the convolution integral of two functions can be

expressed as the product of the Fourier transforms of the latter. This simple formula can

be imported in our framework where the Fourier transform represents the Hodge operator

and the convolution integral is a suitable Berezin integral of two diﬀerential forms. With this

observation we are able to express the Hodge dual of the wedge product of two diﬀerential

forms as the (Berezin)-convolution of the Hodge duals of the diﬀerential forms.

In the case of integral forms (that are ”distribution-like”) the convolution product is clearly

the right one, because their graded wedge product vanishes.

Another problem encountered in extending to supermanifolds the concepts of the usual

diﬀerential geometry is that of the Liouville form in a symplectic supermanifold. The problem

here is that the super-symplectic form is naturally a superform of zero picture and hence the

Liouville form cannot be deﬁned simply as a graded exterior power of the symplectic form,

because there is no a top exterior power and the correct Liouville form must be deﬁned using

instead integral forms. Also in this case an integral representation opens the way.

2

In this present paper we will elaborate on these subjects, on their deﬁnitions and proper-

ties.

Finally, the Fourier (Berezin) integral representation of the Hodge dual operator can be

extended to noncommutative spaces. A very recent work on this appeared in [7], and the idea

of a Fourier-Berezin transform can be found also in [8].

2 Forms and Integration

The usual integration theory of diﬀerential forms for bosonic manifolds can be conveniently

rephrased to uncover its relation with Berezin integration.

We start with a simple example: consider in R the integrable 1-form ω = g(x)dx (with

g(x) an integrable function in R ). We have:

(cid:90)

(cid:90) +∞

−∞

ω =

R

g(x)dx .

Observing that dx is an anticommuting quantity, and denoting it by ψ, we could think of ω
as a function on the superspace R1|1:

ω = g(x)dx = f (x, ψ) = g(x)ψ

(2.1)

This function can be integrated `a la Berezin reproducing the usual deﬁnition:

(cid:90)

R1|1

(cid:90) +∞

−∞

(cid:90)

ω

R

f (x, ψ)[dxdψ] =

g(x)dx =

Note that the symbol of the formal measure [dxdψ] is written just to emphasize that we are

integrating on the two variables x and ψ, hence the dx inside [dxdψ] is not identiﬁed with ψ.

rior bundle Ω•(M ) =(cid:80)n

(cid:86)p(M ) is the direct sum of(cid:86)p(M ) (sometimes denoted also by

Denoting by M a bosonic orientable diﬀerentiable manifold of dimension n, its exte-

p=0

Ωp(M )). A section ω of Ωp(M ) can be written locally as

(cid:88)

ω =

ωi1...ip(x)dxi1 ∧ ··· ∧ dxip

(2.2)

3

where the coeﬃcients ωi1...ip(x) are functions on M and i1 < ... < ip. The integral of ω ∈
Ωn(M ) is deﬁned as:

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

I[ω] =

ω =

ωi1...in(x) dnx ,

(2.3)

This opens the way to relating the integration theory of forms and the Berezin integral,

M

M

by substituting every 1-form dxi with a corresponding abstract Grassmann variable denoted
again with dxi. A section ω of Ω•(M ) is viewed locally as a function on a supermanifold
M =T ∗(M ) with coordinates (xi, dxi) :

ω(x, dx) =

ωi1...ip(x)dxi1 . . . dxip ;

(2.4)

(cid:88)

(cid:90)

M=T ∗(M )

such functions are polynomials in dx’s. Supposing now that the form ω is integrable, its

Berezin integral gives:

ω(x, dx)[dnxdn(dx)] =

monomial expression of some anticommuting variables αk not depending on the ξi, we deﬁne:
R0|n αξ1...ξn [dnξ] = α, where the product between α and the ξi is the usual Z2 graded
wedge product in the superalgebra generated by the tensor product of the Grassmann algebra
generated by the ξi and that generated by the αk : if A and B are two Z2-graded algebras
with products ·Aand ·B, the Z2-graded tensor product A ⊗ B is a Z2-graded algebra with the
product (for homogeneous elements) given by :

(a ⊗ b) ·A⊗B (a(cid:48) ⊗ b(cid:48)) = (−1)|a(cid:48)||b|a ·A a(cid:48) ⊗ b ·B b(cid:48)

In our case the algebras are Grassmann algebras and the products · are wedge products. The
symbols ⊗ and ∧ will be, in general, omitted.

(cid:90)

g

As observed in [1] one can obtain the usual Hodge dual in Rn (for a metric given by a
matrix A with entries gij ) by means of the Fourier (Berezin)-integral transform T . For
ω(x, dx) ∈ Ωk(Rn) we have:

(cid:63) ω = i(k2−n2)

T (ω) = i(k2−n2)

ω(x, η(cid:48))eidxAη(cid:48)

(3.1)

g

R0|n
where g = detA and the exponential series deﬁning eidxAη(cid:48)
is written using the Z2 graded
wedge product quoted above. The Grassmann variables η(cid:48) are deﬁned as η(cid:48) = A−1η where
the η are the (parity changed) variables dual to the dx. In this way the covariance properties
of ω(x, η(cid:48)) are exactly those of a diﬀerential form.

The factor i(k2−n2) can be obtained by computing the transformation of the monomial

form dx1dx2...dxk in the simple case A = I.

The explicit computation gives:

i(k2−n2)T (cid:0)dx1...dxk(cid:1) = (cid:63)(cid:0)dx1...dxk(cid:1)

and

T 2 (ω) = i(n2−k2)i(k2) (ω) = in2 (ω)

yielding the usual duality relation:

(cid:63) (cid:63)ω = i((n−k)2−n2)i(k2−n2)in2(ω) = (−1)k(k−n)(ω)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

As for functions, one can deﬁne a convolution product between diﬀerential forms on an

ordinary manifold. The starting point is again the interpretation of diﬀerential forms as func-
tions of the commuting variables x and the anticommuting variables dx. For α ∈ Ωp(Rn) and
β ∈ Ωq(Rn), the convolution product • is deﬁned using Berezin integration on the anticom-
muting variables:

α • β(x, dx) =

α(x, ξ)β(x, dx − ξ)[dnξ]

(3.5)
where ξ is an auxiliary anticommuting variable. The convolution product 1 maps Ωp × Ωq →
Ωp+q−n . To obtain (generically) non trivial results we must have 0 ≤ p + q − n ≤ n. The

algebra of this convolution is

α • β = (−1)(n2+pq)β • α

The convolution ‘interacts” well with the integral transformation T deﬁned above and the
wedge product. We will consider explicitly only the standard bosonic case in which the matrix

A of the.previous paragraph is the identity matrix I.

For example, in the case n = 4, we can compute T (dx1dx2) = dx3dx4 and T (dx1) =

(−i) dx2dx3dx4, T (dx2) = idx1dx3dx4. The convolution is:

T (cid:0)dx1(cid:1) • T (cid:0)dx2(cid:1) =

(cid:90)

R0|4

(−i) ξ2ξ3ξ4 (i)(cid:0)dx1 − ξ1(cid:1)(cid:0)dx3 − ξ3(cid:1)(cid:0)dx4 − ξ4(cid:1) [d4ξ]
= dx3dx4 = T (cid:0)dx1dx2(cid:1)

Another simple example is the case q = n − p where we ﬁnd:

in2 (−1)p (−1)p(n−p) T (αβ) = T (α) • T (β)

Indeed, recalling that:

T (cid:0)dx1...dxp(cid:1) = i(n2−p2)(dxp+1dxp+2...dxn)
T (cid:0)dxp+1...dxn(cid:1) = i(p2)(dx1dx2...dxp)

T (cid:0)dx1...dxn(cid:1) = 1

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

T (cid:0)dx1...dxp(cid:1) • T (cid:0)dxp+1...dxn(cid:1) = in2(cid:90)
(ξp+1...ξn) (−1)p ξ1...ξp [dnξ] = in2 (−1)p (−1)p(n−p) T (cid:0)dx1dx2...dxn(cid:1)

R0|n

(ξp+1...ξn)(dx1 − ξ1)...(dxp − ξp) [dnξ] =

(3.10)

(3.11)

we ﬁnd:

in2(cid:90)

R0|n

The properties of the convolution reﬂect on corresponding properties of the Hodge star
operator. Using (cid:63)ω = i(k2−n2)T (ω) for ω(x, dx) ∈ Ωk(Rn), we obtain a simple formula for the
Hodge dual of the wedge product of forms in the case p + q = n:

(cid:63) (αβ) = (−1)p ((cid:63)α) • ((cid:63)β)

(3.12)

6

Considering now the general case of a p-form α and a q-form β in a n-dimensional space,

one can prove the following relation:

(cid:63) (αβ) = (−1)n+q(n−p) ((cid:63)α) • ((cid:63)β)

easily checked to be satisﬁed by the monomials

α = dx1dx2...dxp,

β = dxn−q+1dxn−q+2...dxn

Indeed recall that

(cid:63) α = dxp+1...dxn,

(cid:63) β = (−1)q(n−q)dx1...dxn−q

(cid:63) (αβ) = (−1)q(n−p−q)dxp+1...dxn−q

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

Moreover, using the deﬁnition of the convolution, one ﬁnds

((cid:63)α) • ((cid:63)β) = (−1)q(n−q)(−1)p(−1)n(n−q−p)(−1)p(n−p)dxp+1...dxn−q

(3.17)

Comparing the last two equations, relation (3.13) follows. By linearity the same relation

(3.13) holds also for generic forms. Two particular cases provide nontrivial checks:

i) when α = 1 ∈ Ω0 :

(cid:63) (1β) = (−1)n+qn ((cid:63)1) • ((cid:63)β) = (−1)n+qn

(cid:90)

(ξ1...ξn) ((cid:63)β(dx − ξ)) [dnξ]
R0|n
= (−1)n+qn (−1)n(n−q) (cid:63) β = (cid:63)β

ii) when β = 1 ∈ Ω0:
(cid:63) (α1) = (−1)n ((cid:63)α) • ((cid:63)1) = (−1)n
= (−1)n

(cid:90)
(cid:90)

((cid:63)α) (ξ) (dx1 − ξ1)...(dxn − ξn) [dnξ]

R0|n

where we used the traslational invariance (under ξ → ξ + dx) of the Berezin integral.

Similar relations hold (modulo some suitable multiplicative coeﬃcient depending also on

the metric) for the more general integral transform that gives the Hodge dual for a generic

metric A.

(3.18)

(3.19)

The convolution deﬁned in the formula (3.5) can be normalized as:

α •(cid:48) β(x, dx) = (−1)(n+pn+pq)α • β

where again p is the degree of α, q the degree of β, and n the dimension of the space.

With this normalization the formula (3.13) looks better:

(cid:63) (αβ) = ((cid:63)α) •(cid:48) ((cid:63)β)

Indeed, noting that ((cid:63)α) • ((cid:63)β) = (−1)n+(n−p)n+(n−p)(n−q) ((cid:63)α) •(cid:48) ((cid:63)β), we have:

(cid:63) (αβ) = (−1)n+q(n−p) (−1)n+(n−p)n+(n−p)(n−q) ((cid:63)α) •(cid:48) ((cid:63)β) = ((cid:63)α) •(cid:48) ((cid:63)β)

The algebra of this new convolution is:

(3.20)

(3.21)

α •(cid:48) β = (−1)(n−p)(n−q)β •(cid:48) α

(3.22)

Clearly this normalized convolution product has a unit, the standard volume form (cid:63)1.

Equation (3.21) and the associativity of the wedge product show that the convolution

product •(cid:48) is associative:

((cid:63)α •(cid:48) (cid:63)β) •(cid:48) ((cid:63)γ) = (cid:63) [(αβ) γ] = (cid:63) [α (βγ)] = (cid:63)α •(cid:48) ((cid:63)β •(cid:48) (cid:63)γ)

As last remark, we point out that, using our Fourier representation of the Hodge dual, it

is easy to deduce the standard formula:

α ∧ (cid:63)α = (α, α) (cid:63) 1 ,

(3.23)

where (·,·) is the scalar product associated to the metric g. Moreover, the same scalar product
can be rewritten with the new convolution as

(α, α) = α •(cid:48) (cid:63)α = (−1)p(n−p) (cid:63) α •(cid:48) α

(3.24)

where instead of the wedge product we have used the convolution product.

4 Super Hodge dual and super Convolutions

We start, as usual, from the real superspace Rn|m with n bosonic (xi, i = 1, . . . , n) and m
fermionic (θα, α = 1, . . . , m) coordinates. We will consider Rn|m as a DeWitt supermanifold
in which we take the split coordinates so that the xi are real numbers. We denote by T the
tangent bundle and by T ∗ the cotangent bundle. To simplify the notations we will denote by
the same letter a bundle and the Z2−graded modules of its sections.

These modules are generated over the ring of superfunctions as follows (i = 1...n ; α = 1...m):

∂
∂xi and the odd vectors
T by the even vectors
T ∗ by the even forms dθαand the odd forms dxi

∂
∂θα

If Π is the parity reversal symbol (cid:0)ΠRp|q = Rq|p(cid:1), we can consider the bundle ΠT . The

Z2−graded module of its sections is generated by the even vectors bα and the odd vectors ηi
We consider now the Z2− graded tensor product T ∗ ⊗ ΠT and the invariant even section

σ given by:

Introducing a a (pseudo)riemannian metric A = g(cid:0) ∂

and det B (cid:54)= 0.

0 B

(cid:19)

In matrix notations, omitting (here and in the following) the tensor product symbol, the

section σ can be written as:

σ = dxAA−1η + dθBB−1b = dxAη(cid:48) + dθBb(cid:48) = dZGW (cid:48)

(cid:18)η(cid:48)

b(cid:48)

where η(cid:48) = A−1η and b(cid:48) = B−1b are the covariant forms corresponding to the vectors η and b,
and dZ = (dx dθ) and W (cid:48) =

.

If ω(x, θ, dx, dθ) is a superform in Ω(p|0), the even section σ can be used to generate an

integral transform that can be considered as a ﬁberwise integration on the ﬁbers of T ∗:

9

T (ω)(x, θ, dx, dθ) =

ω(x, θ, η(cid:48), b(cid:48))ei(dxAη(cid:48)+dθBb(cid:48)) [dnη(cid:48)dmb(cid:48)]

(4.2)
where ω(x, θ, η(cid:48), b(cid:48)) has polynomial dependence in the variables θ, η(cid:48) and b(cid:48) and eiσ is deﬁned
as the usual power series. The integral over the odd η(cid:48) variables is a Berezin integral and the
integral over the even b(cid:48) variables is deﬁned by formal rules, for example:

(4.4)

R2

We can generalize the Hodge dual to superforms of zero picture (note that the spaces of

superforms or of integral forms are all ﬁnite dimensional) where we have the two types of

diﬀerentials, dθ and dx.

A zero picture p−superform ω is a combination of a ﬁnite number of monomial elements

of the form:

ρ(r,l) (x, θ, dx, dθ) = f (x, θ)dxi1dxi2...dxir(cid:0)dθ1(cid:1)l1(cid:0)dθ2(cid:1)l2 ... (dθs)ls

(4.5)

of total degree equal to p = r + l1 + l2 + ... + ls. We denote by l the sum of the li. We have
also r ≤ n.

The super Hodge dual on the monomials can be deﬁned as:

The normalization coeﬃcient is given by: α(l) = 2pl − l2 − nl − l (with l = p − r) if n is

even and α(l) = l if n is odd. These coeﬃcient was computed in [1]

The (cid:63) operator on monomials can be extended by linearity to generic forms in Ω(p|0) :

(cid:63) : Ω(p|0) −→ Ω(n−p|m)

Both spaces are ﬁnite dimensional and (cid:63) is an isomorphism2.

An important example in Rn|m is 1 ∈ Ω(0|0):

In the case of Ω(p|m), a m− picture p−integral form ω is a combination of a ﬁnite number

of monomial elements of the form:

ρ(r|j) (x, θ, dx, dθ) = f (x, θ)dxi1dxi2...dxirδ(j1)(cid:0)dθ1(cid:1) δ(j2)(cid:0)dθ2(cid:1) ...δ(jm) (dθm)

where p = r − (j1 + j2 + ... + jm) . We denote by j the sum of the ji. We have also r ≤ n.

The Hodge dual is:

where G(ab)(x, θ), G[αβ](x, θ) are even matrices and Gaβ(x, θ), Gαb(x, θ) are odd matrices. In

matrix notation the even section σ is in this case given by:

σ = dZGG−1W = dxAη(cid:48) + dθBb(cid:48) + dxCb(cid:48) + dθDη(cid:48)

2The normalization coeﬃcients chosen in the deﬁnitions of the duals of ρ(r,l) and ρ(r|j) lead to the usual

duality on Ω(p|0) :

(cid:63) (cid:63) ρ(r,p−r) = (−1)p(p−n)ρ(r,p−r)

In general, the super matrix G can be expressed in terms of the supervielbein V as follows

G = VG0VT

where G0 is an invariant constant super matrix characterizing the tangent space of the super-
manifold R(n|m). The overall coeﬃcient of the Hodge dual becomes

(cid:112)|SdetG0|

SdetV SdetG0

where SdetV is the superdeterminant of the supervielbein.

In the case of integral forms (that are ”distribution-like”) the convolution product is clearly

the right one, because the product of integral forms vanishes using the graded wedge product.

(cid:90)

Rn|m

The convolution between two integral forms α and β can be deﬁned as before:

α • β(x, dx, θ, dθ) =

α(x, ξ, θ, b)β(x, dx − ξ, θ, dθ − b))[dnξdmb]

(4.10)

Again the integral is a Berezin integral for the variables ξ and a usual integral for the variables

b. What is important here is that the convolution of two integral forms is again an integral

form (i.e. the total number of delta forms and derivatives of delta forms is conserved). This
convolution product maps Ωp|m × Ωq|m → Ωp+q−n|m. Note that, in this case, the form number
can be negative.

Integral Representation of PCOs

Another interesting integral transform (see [5]) is a ﬁberwise integration not on T ∗ but on
the parity changed normal bundle N of the reduced bosonic manifold M (cid:39) Rn. The reduced
manifold M with tangent bundle T (M ) is embedded into M by setting all the anticommuting
coordinates to zero; its normal bundle N is deﬁned as:

0 −→ T (M ) −→ TM −→ N −→ 0

(5.1)
where TM is the tangent bundle of the supermanifold M restricted to the reduced manifold
∂
M. The ﬁbers of N are odd and its sections are generated by the odd vectors
∂θα . It is known

12

that the total space of N is a supermanifold isomorphic to M; any real supermanifold can
be described as a vector bundle with even base and odd ﬁbers. We consider now the parity

changed bundle ΠN with sections generated by the even vectors bα. The total space of ΠN

is a bosonic manifold with coordinates x and b. A diﬀerential form on ΠN is a function

(cid:90)
(cid:90)

Rm|m

Rm|m

ω(x, b, dx, db) and we can deﬁne an integral ﬁberwise transform:

T (ω)(x, θ, dx, dθ) =

=

ω(x, b, dx, db)ei(θdb−dθb) [dm(db)dmb]

ω(x, b, dx, db)e−id(θb) [dm(db)dmb]

(5.2)

where the even variables dθ are dual to the even variables b and the odd variables θ are dual

to the odd variables db. The integral over the odd variables db is a Berezin integral. We see

that this integral transform maps diﬀerential forms on the parity changed normal bundle into

pseudoforms on N.

Depending on the nature of the forms transformed, the pseudoforms obtained can be very

general: polynomial or forms in the commuting diﬀerentials and even distribution-like forms

when ω(x, b, dx, db) is polynomial in the commuting variables b. If ω(x, b, dx, db) is generalized

to a distribution valued form its trasformation is a superform3.

Comparing this transformation with the transformation deﬁned in the formula (4.2) we

observe that it is not suitable for deﬁning a super Hodge dual but it is connected to the

picture changing operators.

The Picture Changing Operators (PCOs) where introduced in [9] in string theory. These

operators are non trivial elements of H (0|r)
and integral)-forms on supermanifolds, gives isomorphisms in cohomology, and can be de-

, act connecting the complexes of (super, pseudo

d

scribed in our context as follows.

Given a constant commuting vector v we deﬁne the following form:

(5.3)
which is d−closed but not d−exact. Yv belongs to Ω(0|1) and by choosing m independent
3For example, if ω = bdb then T (ω) = iδ(cid:48)(dθ) and if ω = δ(cid:48)(b)db then T (ω) = −idθ. The imaginary factors

Yv = vαθαδ(vαdθα) ,

could be eliminated introducing a normalization factor in the deﬁnition of the integral transformation.

m(cid:89)

α=1

Yv(α) = det(v(α)

β )θα1 . . . θαmδ(dθα1) . . . δ(dθαm) ,

(5.4)

where v(α)

β

is the β-component of the α-vector. We can apply the PCO on a given form by

taking the graded wedge product.

For example, given ω in Ω(p|r) , we have

ω −→ ω ∧ Yv ∈ Ω(p|r+1) ,

(5.5)

Notice that if r = m, then ω ∧ Yv = 0; on the other hand, if v does not depend on the
arguments of the delta forms in ω, we obtain a non-vanishing form. In addition, if dω = 0
then d(ω ∧ Yv) = 0 (by applying the Leibniz rule), and if ω (cid:54)= dK then it follows that also
ω ∧ Yv (cid:54)= dU where U is a form in Ω(p−1|r+1). The Yv are non trivial elements of the de Rham
cohomology and they are globally deﬁned. So, given an element of the cohomogy H (p|r)
, the
new form ω ∧ Yv is an element of H (p|r+1)

.

An integral representation of these operators is obtained acting with the transformation

(5.2) on suitable forms of type ω(x, dx, b, db).

For example

Y(0|1) = θδ (dθ) =

(cid:90)

R1|1

ei(θdb−dθb) [d(db)db]

(5.6)

with ω(x, dx, b, db) = 1.

The PCO Y(0|1) is an example of this kind of operators, acting on Ω(p|0) and increasing
the number of delta forms, and therefore increasing the picture. As was shown in [10], Y(0|1)
generates the cohomology H (0|1)
; therefore, any other cohomology representative can be
expressed in terms of Y(0|1) up to d-exact terms. For example, we can consider the following
form

d

ω(x, dx, b, db) = 1 + ibdxdb

whose trasformation gives

(cid:98)Y(0|1) = −dxδ(cid:48)(dθ) + θδ(dθ) = d(−xδ(cid:48)(dθ)) + Y(0|1) ,

(5.7)

(5.8)

14

which clearly diﬀers from Y(0|1) by a d-exact term. The new PCO (cid:98)Y(0|1) can also be written

as

(cid:98)Y(0|1) = −(dx + θdθ)δ(cid:48)(dθ).

(5.9)

It is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations δx = θ and δθ =  with  a constant

anticommuting parameter. Therefore, even though (cid:98)Y(0|1) belongs to the same cohomology

class of Y(0|1), it has interesting properties, lacking for Y(0|1). The exact term in (5.8) is not
supersymmetric and the corresponding variation of Y(0|1) is d-exact: δY(0|1) = d(−θδ(cid:48)(dθ)).
The PCO’s of the type Y are needed to increase the number of delta’s in the diﬀerential
forms, passing from zero-pictures to the highest possible picture.4 However given an integral

form, we need to be able to construct a superform by acting with another operator decreasing

the picture number. That can be achieved by considering the following operator:

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

δ(ιD) =

exp

itιD

dt

(5.10)

where D is an odd vector ﬁeld on T (M) with [D, D] (cid:54)= 0 and ιD is the contraction along the
vector D.

For example, if we decompose D on a basis D = Dα∂θα, where the Dα are even coeﬃcients

and {∂θα} is a basis of the odd vector ﬁelds, and take ω = ωβdθβ ∈ Ω(1|0), we have

∂dθα ∈ Ω(0|0) .
ιDω = Dαωα = Dα ∂ω
(5.11)
D (cid:54)= 0. The diﬀerential operator δ(ια) ≡
In addition, due to [D, D] (cid:54)= 0, we have also that ι2
δ (ιD) – with D = ∂θα – acts on the space of integral forms as follows (we neglect possible

introduction of derivatives of delta forms, but that generalization can be easily done):

m(cid:89)

δ(dθβ) =

δ(dθα + it)

δ(dθβ)

(5.12)

(cid:90) ∞

4There is also the possibility to increase the picture to a number between zero and the maximum value.
In that case we have pseudo-diﬀerential forms (i.e. forms with picture < m), however, since we do not use
them in the present work, we leave aside such a possibility.

15

The result contains m− 1 delta forms, and therefore it has picture m− 1. The picture number
is decreased. Acting several times with δ(ιD), we can remove all the delta’s. Note that δ(ια)

is an odd operator because maps an even (odd) product of delta forms in an odd (even) one.
Let us consider now, in the simplest case M = R(1|1), the following ”double” diﬀerential

operator

Z(0|−1) = −i∂θδ(ι∂θ
where ∂θ is the partial derivative along θ and ι∂θ

) = iδ(ι∂θ

)∂θ

(5.13)

is the contraction along that vector.

The operator Z(0|−1) is the product of two operators acting on diﬀerent quantities: ∂θ acts
) acts only on the delta forms. Then, we can easily check that:

only on functions, and δ(ι∂θ

Z(0|−1) ◦ Y(0|1) = 1 .

(5.14)

A more general form for Z(0|−1) could be constructed, but we are not interested here in such
a generalization. Moreover, for several variables θα, we can consider the product of single

operators .

Finally, we note that the Voronov integral transform can be used to produce a represen-
tation of the operator Z(0|−1) as a multiplication operator in the space of ”dual forms” i.e. of
type ω(x, b, dx, db).

The usual Fourier transform F in R (with coordinate x) gives a representation of the

derivative operator d

dx as a multiplication5 in the momentum space (with coordinate p).

In our simple case the operator Z(0|−1) acts on the spaces Ω(0|1) and Ω(1|1) producing

elements of Ω(0|0) and Ω(1|0) respectively.

A generic form ω ∈ Ω(0|1)⊕ Ω(1|1) but /∈ ker Z(0|−1) can be written as:

because Z(0|−1)(cid:16)

(cid:17)

= Z(0|−1)(cid:16)

dxδ(cid:48)(dθ)
The action of the operator Z(0|−1) gives:

δ(dθ)

(cid:17)

= Z(0|−1)(cid:16)

(cid:17)

θdxδ(cid:48)(dθ)

= 0

ω(x, dx, θ, dθ) = f (x)θδ(dθ) + g(x)θdxδ(dθ).

5For a function f (x) we have

dx

Z(0|−1)(ω) = f (x) − g(x)dx ∈ Ω(0|0) ⊕ Ω(1|0)

(p) = ipF(f )(p) and this is usually written as F(cid:0) d

(cid:104)F df

(cid:105)

dx

16

(5.15)

(5.16)

(cid:1) = ip

Denoting again by ΠN the even normal bundle of the embedding R → R(1|1), acting with the
Voronov antitransform (that we call here again T ) we obtain:

T (ω) = f (x) − g(x)dx ∈ Ω0 (ΠN ) ⊕ Ω1(ΠN )

(5.17)

and

T(cid:16)Z(0|−1)(ω)

(cid:17)

(x, dx, b, db) = [f (x) − g(x)dx] δ (b) db ∈ Ω0 (ΠN ) ⊕ Ω1(ΠN )

(5.18)

where, as above, we allow also distributional valued diﬀerential forms. Finally, from this we

get the desired right multiplicative representation:

T(cid:16)Z(0|−1)(cid:17)

= δ (b) db

(5.19)

Similar considerations and computations yield the representation in more general cases.

6 Super Liouville Measure for super K¨ahler Manifolds.

Another interesting integral representation leads to riemannian and symplectic volumes of

supermanifolds. Many examples of riemannian and symplectic volumes for supermanifolds

have been also recently studied by Voronov [11]

Let us consider a bosonic compact K¨ahler manifold M , characterised by a K¨ahler potential
K, depending on the complex variables (Z I). From the K¨ahler potential, one extracts the
K¨ahler 2-form

K (2) = dZ I ∧ d ¯Z ¯J ∂I

¯∂ ¯JK = gI ¯J (Z, ¯Z) dZ I ∧ d ¯Z ¯J .

(6.1)
The matrix g = (gI ¯J ) is a n× n matrix depending on Z I and the complex conjugate ¯Z ¯J . The
Liouville measure is given by

(cid:124)

(cid:123)(cid:122)

(6.2)

M dV (n) = vol(M ) computes the symplectic volume of the K¨ahler manifold that coincides

and(cid:82)

with the riemannian one.

17

This expression can be rewritten as a Berezin integral by introducing two sets of new

anticommuting dual variables ηI, ¯η ¯I and ξI, ¯ξ ¯I

I=1

The left hand side is a factorized expression and, under a reparametrization of the manifold,

the combination of the two factors is invariant. The right hand side has the same property as
it can be shown by observing that the variables ηI transform covariantly, while ξI transform
controvariantly.

Let us move to a supermanifold M with dimensions (n|m). We consider a super-K¨ahler

2-superform K (2|0):

K (2|0) = gI ¯J dZ I ∧ d ¯Z ¯J + gI ¯β dZ I ∧ d¯θ ¯β + gα ¯J dθα ∧ d ¯Z ¯J + gα ¯β dθα ∧ d¯θ ¯β

(6.4)

where the matrices gI ¯J , gI ¯β, gα ¯J , gα ¯β form a supermatix

(cid:18) gI ¯J

gI ¯β
gα ¯J gα ¯β

GA ¯B =

A = (I, α) ,

¯B = ( ¯J, ¯β) ,

(6.5)

whose entries are superﬁelds, functions of (Z I, θa) and of their conjugated.

In this case one cannot simply deﬁne the super-Liouville form as K (2|0) ∧ ··· ∧ K (2|0)

(cid:124)

(cid:123)(cid:122)

n

(cid:125)

mainly because this expression would be a (non integrable) superform of zero picture and

not a top integral form. Using a generalization of the integral representation given before,

(cid:90)

one can instead deﬁne the correct super-Liouville form as:

e−(gI ¯J ηI ¯η ¯J +gI ¯β ηI¯b ¯β +gα ¯J bα ¯η ¯J +gα ¯β bα¯b ¯β )+ξI dZI + ¯ξI d ¯ZI +cadθα+¯c ¯αd¯θ ¯α

That is a top integral form. See also Witten [12].

(6.6)

The integral is a Berezin integral in the variables ηI and ξI and it is a usual integral over
the commuting variables bα and cα. Integrating over ηI and ¯η ¯I and over bα and ¯b ¯α leads to

(6.8)

the Berezinian. The integral over ξI, ¯ξ ¯I and over cα, ¯c ¯α produces the second and the third
factor in the left hand side. Both sides are invariant under reparametrization. Notice that

the Berezin integral produces the numerator of the superdeterminat while the integral over

the bosonic variables gives the denominator.

So, the Liouville ”measure” for a K¨alher supermanifold is

dV (n|m) = Sdet(GA ¯B)

dZ Id ¯Z I

δ(dθα)δ(d¯θ ¯α)

The integral of this measure gives the super volume. The volume element dV (n|m) is an
integral top form and (as in the usual bosonic case) it is equal to the superHodge dual (cid:63)1 as

I=1

α=1

explained in the previous paragraph.

The same procedure can clearly be implemented in the more general case of a symplectic

supermanifold to produce the symplectic volume element, showing again the power of inte-

gral representations for generalizing to supergeometry many familiar concepts of diﬀerential

geometry.
