L2 SOLVABILITY OF BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
FOR DIVERGENCE FORM PARABOLIC EQUATIONS

WITH COMPLEX COEFFICIENTS

K. NYSTR ¨OM

Abstract. We consider parabolic operators of the form

∂t + L, L = −div A(X, t)∇,

+

in Rn+2
:= {(X, t) = (x, xn+1, t) ∈ Rn × R × R : xn+1 > 0}, n ≥ 1. We assume that A is a (n + 1) × (n +
1)-dimensional matrix which is bounded, measurable, uniformly elliptic and complex, and we assume,
in addition, that the entries of A are independent of the spatial coordinate xn+1 as well as of the time
coordinate t. For such operators we prove that the boundedness and invertibility of the corresponding
layer potential operators are stable on L2(Rn+1, C) = L2(∂Rn+2
+ , C) under complex, L∞ perturbations of
the coeﬃcient matrix. Subsequently, using this general result, we establish solvability of the Dirichlet,
Neumann and Regularity problems for ∂t + L, by way of layer potentials and with data in L2, assuming
that the coeﬃcient matrix is a small complex perturbation of either a constant matrix or of a real and
symmetric matrix.

In this paper we study the solvability of the Dirichlet, Neumann and Regularity problems with data
in L2, in the following these problems are referred to as (D2), (N2) and (R2), see (2.42) below for the
exact deﬁnition of these problems, by way of layer potentials and for second order parabolic equations
of the form

Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates stated in (2.24)-(2.25) below, we ﬁrst prove (Theorem 1.6, Corollary 1.7)
that the solvability of (D2), (N2) and (R2), by way of layer potentials, is stable under small complex L∞
perturbations of the coeﬃcient matrix. Subsequently, using Theorem 1.6, Corollary 1.7, we establish
the solvability for (D2), (N2) and (R2), by way of layer potentials, when the coeﬃcient matrix is either

(i)

(ii)
(iii)

a small complex perturbation of a constant
(complex) matrix (Theorem 1.8), or,
a real and symmetric matrix (Theorem 1.9), or,
a small complex perturbation of a real and
symmetric matrix (Theorem 1.10).

(1.5)

We emphasize that in (1.5) (i)− (iii) the unique solutions can be represented in terms of layer potentials
and we remark that for the class of operators we consider, solvability of these boundary value problems
in the upper half space can readily be generalized, by a change of coordinates, to the geometrical setting
of a domain given as the region above a time-independent Lipschitz graph. We emphasize that already
in the case when A is real and symmetric our contribution is twofold. First, we prove solvability of
(D2), (N2) and (R2). Second, we prove solvability of (D2), (N2) and (R2) by way of layer potentials.
To our knowledge Theorem 1.6, Corollary 1.7, Theorem 1.8, Theorem 1.9, and Theorem 1.10 are all
new, see subsection 1.2 below for an outline of the state of the art of second order parabolic boundary
value problems with non-smooth coeﬃcients, but we note that in [CNS] we, together with A. Castro and
O. Sande, develop some of the estimates used in this paper. [CNS] should be seen as a companion to
this paper. We claim that our results, and the tools developed, pave the way for important developments
in the area of parabolic PDEs, see Remark 1.13 and Remark 1.14 below.

The main results of this paper can be seen as parabolic analogues of the elliptic results established
in [AAAHK] and we recall that in [AAAHK] the authors establish results concerning the solvability of
(D2), (N2) and (R2), by way of layer potentials and for elliptic operators of the form −div A(X)∇, in
Rn+1
:= {X = (x, xn+1) ∈ Rn × R : xn+1 > 0}, n ≥ 1, assuming that A is a (n + 1) × (n + 1)-dimensional
matrix which is bounded, measurable, uniformly elliptic and complex, and assuming, in addition, that
the entries of A are independent of the spatial coordinate xn+1. If A is also real and symmetric, (D2),
(N2) and (R2) were solved in [JK], [KP], [KP1], and the major achievement in [AAAHK] is that the
authors prove that solutions can be represented by way of layer potentials. We refer to [AAAHK] for
a thorough account of the history of these problems in the context of elliptic equations. In [HMM]
a version of [AAAHK], but in the context of Lp and relevant endpoint spaces, was developed and in
[HMaMi] the structural assumption that A is independent of the spatial coordinate xn+1 is challenged.
The core of the impressive arguments and estimates in [AAAHK] is based on the ﬁne and elaborated
techniques developed in the proof of the Kato conjecture, see [AHLMcT] and [AHLeMcT], [HLMc]. In
this context it is also relevant to mention the novel approach to the Dirichlet, Neumann and Regularity
problems developed in [AAM], [AA], and [AR]. This approach is based on a reduction of the PDE to a
ﬁrst order system which is then solved using functional calculus.

While our set up and our results coincide, in the stationary case, with the set up and results established
in [AAAHK] for elliptic equations, we claim that our results are not straightforward generalizations of
the corresponding results in [AAAHK]. First, our results rely on [N] where certain square function
estimates are established for second order parabolic operators of the form H, and where, in particular, a
parabolic version of the technology in [AHLMcT] is developed. Second, in general the presence of the
(ﬁrst order) time-derivative forces us to consider fractional time-derivatives leading, as in [LM], [HL],
[H], see also [HL1], to rather elaborate additional estimates. Having said this we acknowledge, once
and for all, the inﬂuence that the work in [AAAHK] has had on our understanding of the topic, and on
this paper, and we believe that [AAAHK] as well as this paper represent important contributions to the
theory of partial diﬀerential equations.

1.1. Statement of main results. Consider H = ∂t + L = ∂t − div A∇. We let H∗ be the hermitian
adjoint of H, i.e.,

ZRn+2

(H ψ) ¯φ dXdt =ZRn+2

ψ(H∗φ) dXdt,

whenever φ, ψ ∈ C∞0 (Rn+2, C). Then H∗ = −∂t + L∗ = −∂t − div A∗∇, where L∗ and A∗ = ¯A are the
hermitian adjoints of L and A, respectively. The following are our main results.
Theorem 1.6. Consider two operators H0 = ∂t − div A0∇, H1 = ∂t − div A1∇. Assume that H0, H∗0 ,
H1, H∗1 satisfy (1.3)-(1.4) as well as the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates stated in (2.24)-(2.25) below.
Assume that

H0, H∗0, have bounded, invertible and good layer potentials in the sense
of Deﬁnition 2.51, for some constant Γ0.

Then there exists a constant ε0, depending at most on n, Λ, the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash constants and
Γ0, such that if

||A1 − A0||∞ ≤ ε0,

then there exists a constant Γ1, depending at most on n, Λ, the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash constants and
Γ0, such that

H1, H∗1, have bounded, invertible and good layer potentials in the sense
of Deﬁnition 2.51, with constant Γ1.

Corollary 1.7. Consider two operators H0 = ∂t − div A0∇, H1 = ∂t − div A1∇. Assume that H0, H∗0 ,
H1, H∗1 satisfy (1.3)-(1.4) as well as the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates stated in (2.24)-(2.25) below.
Assume that

(D2), (N2) and (R2) are uniquely solvable, for the operators
H0, H∗0, by way of layer potentials and for a constant Γ0,
in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.56.

Then there exists a constant ε0, depending at most on n, Λ, the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash constants and
Γ0, such that if

||A1 − A0||∞ ≤ ε0,

then then there exists a constant Γ1, depending at most on n, Λ, the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash constants
and Γ0, such that

(D2), (N2) and (R2) are uniquely solvable, for the operators
H1, H∗1, by way of layer potentials and with constant Γ1,
in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.56.

Theorem 1.8. Consider two operators H0 = ∂t − div A0∇, H1 = ∂t − div A1∇. Assume that A0 is
constant and that H0, H1 satisfy (1.3)-(1.4). Then there exists a constant ε0, depending at most on n,
Λ such that if

||A1 − A0||∞ ≤ ε0,

then (D2) for the operator H1 has a unique solution and (N2) and (R2) for the operator H1 have unique
solutions modulo constants. The solutions can be represented in terms of layer potentials.
Theorem 1.9. Assume that H = ∂t − div A∇ satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4). Assume in addition that A is real and
symmetric. Then (D2) for the operator H has a unique solution and (N2) and (R2) for the operator H
have unique solutions modulo constants. The solutions can be represented in terms of layer potentials.
Theorem 1.10. Assume that H0 = ∂t − div A0∇, H1 = ∂t − div A1∇ satisfy (1.3)-(1.4). Assume that A0
is real and symmetric. Then there exists a constant ε0, depending at most on n, Λ such that if

||A1 − A0||∞ ≤ ε0,

4

K. NYSTR ¨OM

then (D2) for the operator H1 has a unique solution and (N2) and (R2) for the operator H1 have unique
solutions modulo constants. The solutions can be represented in terms of layer potentials.

Remark 1.11. Assuming (1.3)-(1.4), as well as the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates stated in (2.24)-
(2.25) below, Theorem 1.6 states that the property of having bounded, invertible and good layer poten-
tials in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.51 is stable under small complex L∞ perturbations of the coeﬃcient
matrix. Corollary 1.7 emphasizes that the solvability of (D2), (N2) and (R2), is stable under small
complex L∞ perturbations of the coeﬃcient matrix.

Remark 1.12. Note that Theorem 1.8 gives the existence and uniqueness for (D2), (N2) and (R2) when-
ever the matrix A1 is a small perturbation of a constant (complex) matrix A0. Theorem 1.9 states that
we have existence and uniqueness for (D2), (N2) and (R2) when A is real and symmetric and satisﬁes
(1.3)-(1.4). Theorem 1.10 states that the latter result is true whenever A1 is a (small) complex perturba-
tion of a real and symmetric matrix A0. In all cases the unique solutions can be represented in terms of
layer potentials.

Remark 1.13. In forthcoming papers we intend to generalize the present paper to the context of Lp and
relevant endpoint spaces, and to challenge the assumption in (1.4). The ambition is to develop parabolic
versions of [HMM], [HMaMi], and [HKMP].

Remark 1.14. The underlying theme of this paper, as well as in [AAAHK], is to basically reduce all
estimates to two core estimates involving single layer potentials. To brieﬂy discuss this, and to be
consistent with the notation used in the bulk of the paper, we let, based on (1.4), λ = xn+1 and when
using the symbol λ we will write the point (X, t) = (x1, .., xn, xn+1, t) as (x, t, λ) = (x1, .., xn, t, λ). We let
L2(Rn+1, C) denote the standard Hilbert space of functions f : Rn+1 → C which are square integrable
and we let || f||2 denote the norm of f . We let

embedded in the statement that H, H∗ have bounded, invertible and good layer potentials with constant
Γ ≥ 1, see display (2.52) in Deﬁnition 2.51. The estimates read

whenever f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C) and where SHλ f and SH∗
f are the single layer potentials associated to H
and H∗, respectively. See (2.45) for the deﬁnition of SHλ f and SH∗
f . Note that (1.16) (i) is a uniform
(in λ) L2-estimate involving the ﬁrst order partial derivative, in the λ-coordinate, of the single layer
potentials, while (1.16) (ii) is a square function estimate involving the second order partial derivatives,
in the λ-coordinate, of the single layer potentials. A key technical challenge in the proof of Theorem
1.6, Corollary 1.7 is to prove that these estimates are stable under small complex perturbations of
the coeﬃcient matrix. However, in the elliptic case and after [AAAHK] appeared, it was proved in
[R], see [GH] for an alternative proof, that if −div A(X)∇ satisﬁes the basic assumptions imposed in
[AAAHK], then the elliptic version of (1.16) (ii) always holds. In fact, the approach in [R], which
is based on functional calculus, even dispenses of the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates underlying
[AAAHK]. Furthermore, in the elliptic case (1.16) (ii) can be seen to imply (1.16) (i) by the results of
[AAAHK] and [AA]. Hence, in the elliptic case, and under the assumptions of [AAAHK], the elliptic
version of (1.16) always holds. Based on this it is fair to pose the question whether or not a similar
line of development can be anticipated in the parabolic case. Based on [N], this paper and [CNS], we
anticipated that a parabolic version of [GH] may be possible to develop and this is currently work in
progress. To develop a parabolic version of [AA] is a very interesting project.

1.2. Relation to the literature. To put our work in context, and to brieﬂy outline previous work de-
voted to parabolic singular integral operators, parabolic layer potentials, as well as the Dirichlet, Neu-
mann and Regularity problems with data in L2 and Lp, for second order parabolic operators in diver-
gence form, it is fair to ﬁrst mention [FR], [FR1], [FR2] where a theory of singular integral operators
with mixed homogeneity was developed in the context of time-independent C1-cylinders. In the setting
of time-independent Lipschitz cylinders and the heat equation, (D2) was solved in [FS], while (D2),
(N2) and (R2) were solved in [B], [B1] by way of layer potentials. In this context the natural pull-back
of the heat operator to a half-space is a second order parabolic operator of the form H with deﬁning
matrix A being real, symmetric, and satisfying (1.3)-(1.4). A major breakthrough in the ﬁeld, in the
setting of time-dependent Lipschitz type cylinders and the heat equation, was achieved in [LS], [LM],
[HL], [H], see also [HL1]. In particular, in these papers the correct notion of time-dependent Lipschitz
type cylinders, correct from the perspective of parabolic singular integral operators, parabolic layer po-
tentials, parabolic measure, as well as the Dirichlet, Neumann and Regularity problems with data in Lp
for the heat operator, was found. In [HL] the authors solved (D2), (N2) and (R2) for the heat operator.
The Neumann and Regularity problems with data in Lp were considered in [HL2] and [HL3]. Due to
the modest regularity assumption in the time-direction imposed in [LM], [HL], [H], in this setting a
more elaborate pull-back to a half-space has to be employed and the resulting operator, in the case of
the heat operator, turns out to be an operator of the form

H − B · ∇ = ∂t − div A(X, t)∇ − B · ∇,

where the term B·∇ is a singular drift term. In this case, A and B will in general depend on xn+1 as well
as t, i.e., A will not satisfy (1.4). Instead the geometry underlying [LM], [HL], [H], will reveal itself
through the fact that certain measures, deﬁned based on A and B, turn out to be Carleson measures. The
ﬁne properties of associated parabolic measures were analyzed in the impressive and inﬂuential work
[HL4], this work also being strongly inﬂuential in the solution of the Kato conjecture, see [AHLeMcT].
A ﬁne contribution to the ﬁeld, simplifying parts of [HL4], was given in [NR].

1.3. Proofs and organization of the paper. Concerning the proofs of our main results it is fair to say
that the skeleton of our proofs is similar to the skeleton of [AAAHK]. However, due to the presence
of the time derivative many of the important details are diﬀerent. To brieﬂy discuss proofs, and the
organization of the paper, we need to introduce some notation. Based on (1.4) we let λ = xn+1 and
when using the symbol λ we will write the point (X, t) = (x1, .., xn, xn+1, t) as (x, t, λ) = (x1, .., xn, t, λ).
Using this notation, and assuming (1.3)-(1.4), we study (D2), (N2) and (R2) for the operator H in

We write ∇ = (∇||, ∂λ) where ∇|| = (∂x1 , ..., ∂xn). We let L2(Rn+1, C) denote the standard Hilbert space of
functions f : Rn+1 → C which are square integrable, we let || f||2 denote the norm of f and we will use
the notation ||| · |||± introduced in (1.15). In the following we refer the reader to Section 2 for notation

and the precise deﬁnitions of the operators D, Ht, Dt
,

and the parabolic Sobolev space H = H(Rn+1, C).

∗

In Section 2, which is of preliminary nature, we introduce notation, function spaces, weak solutions,
state energy estimates, and we introduce non-tangential maximal functions and the problems (D2),
(N2) and (R2). We here also state the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates referred to in the statements of
Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 1.7, we introduce layer potentials and we state Deﬁnition 2.51 and Deﬁnition
2.56.

In Section 3 we establish a number of harmonic analysis results and collect some of the results from
[N] to be used in the sequel. In particular, we introduce the resolvent and establish the existence of a
parabolic Hodge decomposition. We collect estimates from [N] concerning uniform (in λ) L2-estimates
and oﬀ-diagonal estimates, square function estimates for resolvents, and the Littlewood-Paley theory. In
this section we also prove some consequences of uniform (in λ) L2-estimates and oﬀ-diagonal estimates.

In Section 4 we collect and prove a number of estimates related to the boundedness of single layer
potentials: oﬀ-diagonal estimates, uniform (in λ) L2-estimates, estimates of non-tangential maximal
functions and square functions. Much of the material in this section is a summary of the key results
established in [CNS]. The essence of the results stated in Section 4 is that if H = ∂t − div A∇ sat-
isﬁes (1.3)-(1.4), and if we let Sλ = SHλ , S∗λ = SH∗
λ denote the single layer potentials associated to
H and H∗, respectively, then the L2-norms of non-tangential maximal functions in the upper half-
space, ||N+

tial derivatives, and fractional in time derivatives, of Sλ f , as well as the Sobolev semi-norms ||DSλ f||2,

relevant to the solution of (D2), (N2) and (R2), respectively. By the results of Section 4, (1.19) holds
whenever the key estimates in (2.52) of Deﬁnition 2.51, see (1.16) above, hold. At this stage we prove
that the boundary layer potential operators exist in the sense of weak limits in L2(Rn+1, C) as ±λ → 0.

In Section 6 we establish the uniqueness of solutions to (D2), (N2) and (R2).
In Section 7 we are concerned with the existence of non-tangential limits of layer potentials. In par-
ticular, we prove, under assumptions, that the weak limits established in Section 5 can be strengthened
to strong limits in the non-tangential sense.

Starting from Section 8, the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.6, Corollary 1.7
and Theorem 1.8-Theorem 1.10. The smoothed single layer potentials operators SH0,η
are
introduced in (4.4). The proof of Theorem 1.6 is based on a representation formula for the diﬀerence

To handle the contribution to (1.22) from the ﬁrst term on the second line on the right hand side in
the last display we have to make use of the recent square function estimates involving the resolvent E1

established in [N]. As previously mentioned, the estimates in [N] are the parabolic counterparts of the
main and hard estimates in [AHLMcT] established in the context of the solution of the Kato conjecture.

In Section 8 we prove, using the results of Section 3 and techniques and arguments from [N], certain
square function estimates for composed operators involving θλ and the resolvents mentioned above.
This section is a technical core of the paper.

In Section 9 we establish a number of preliminary technical estimates needed in the proof of Theorem

1.6. These estimates rely on the results of Section 3 and Section 8.

In Section 10 we give the ﬁnal proof of Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 1.7 and it is fair to say that, at this
stage, the proof become notational in line with the corresponding arguments in [AAAHK]. Indeed, by
expanding the errors in (1.20) in a manner similar to [FJK] and [AAAHK], we are then in the proof of
Theorem 1.6 confronted with a number of pieces. The most involved piece can be estimated using the
technical estimates established in Section 9. To conclude the proof of Theorem 1.6 we then use analytic

As a consequence of all these estimates we are able to extrapolate all the estimates related to the bound-
edness, invertibility and goodness of the layer potentials associated to H0, H∗0, to the corresponding
estimates, assuming ||ε||∞ ≤ ε0, related to the boundedness, invertibility and goodness of the layer po-
tentials associated to H1, H∗1. We can then complete the proof of Theorem 1.6 using the method of con-
tinuity. Corollary 1.7 basically follows directly from Theorem 1.6, a few additional estimates/remarks,
see Remark 2.54, and from the uniqueness results proved in Section 5.

In Section 11 we prove Theorem 1.8-Theorem 1.10, using Theorem 1.6 and the method of continuity.
To do this in the case of Theorem 1.9, we ﬁrst establish Rellich type estimates, assuming that A is real
and symmetric, related to invertibility.
In addition we here also use the main results established in
[CNS], see Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.8 in [CNS] and Theorem 11.9 stated below. The proof of
Theorem 1.8 in [CNS] is based on a local parabolic Tb-theorem for square functions, see Theorem 8.4
in [CNS], and on a version of the main result in [FS] for equation of the form (1.1), assuming in addition
that A is real and symmetric, see Theorem 8.7 in [CNS]. Both Theorem 8.4 and Theorem 8.7 in [CNS]
are of independent interest.

2. Preliminaries

Let x = (x1, .., xn), X = (x, xn+1), (x, t) = (x1, .., xn, t), (X, t) = (x1, .., xn, xn+1, t). Given (X, t) =
(x, xn+1, t), r > 0, we let Qr(x, t) and ˜Qr(X, t) denote, respectively, the standard parabolic cubes in Rn+1
and Rn+2, centered at (x, t) and (X, t), and of size r. By Q, ˜Q we denote any such parabolic cubes and
we let l(Q), l( ˜Q), (xQ, tQ), (X ˜Q, t ˜Q) denote their sizes and centers, respectively. Given γ > 0, we let γQ,
γ ˜Q be the cubes which have the same centers as Q and ˜Q, respectively, but with sizes deﬁned by γl(Q)
and γl( ˜Q). We let L2(Rn+1, C) denote the standard Hilbert space of functions f : Rn+1 → C equipped
with the inner product ( f, g) := R f ¯g dxdt and we let || f||2 := ( f, f )1/2 denote the norm of f . Given p,
1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, we let Lp(Rn+1, C) denote the standard Banach space of functions f : Rn+1 → C which are
p-integrable and we let || f||p denote the norm of f . Given a set E ⊂ Rn+1 we let |E| denote its Lebesgue
measure and by 1E we denote the indicator function for E. By || · ||Lp(E) we mean || · 1E||p. A function f
belongs to Lp,∞(Rn+1, C) if there exists a constant c such that

l f (τ) := |{(x, t) ∈ Rn+1 : | f (x, t)| ≥ τ}| ≤

cp
τp

whenever τ > 0. The best constant c for which this inequality is valid is the Lp,∞(Rn+1, C)-norm of f
and

|| f||p,∞ := || f||Lp,∞ = || f||Lp,∞(Rn+1,C) = sup
τ>0
Given functions f , ˜f , deﬁned on Rn+1, Rn+2, respectively, we let

denote the averages of f , ˜f on the sets E ⊂ Rn+1, ˜E ⊂ Rn+2, respectively. Furthermore, as mentioned
and based on (1.4), we will frequently also use a diﬀerent convention concerning the labeling of the
coordinates: we let λ = xn+1 and when using the symbol λ, the point (X, t) = (x, xn+1, t) will be written
as (x, t, λ) = (x1, .., xn, t, λ). We write ∇ = (∇||, ∂λ) where ∇|| = (∂x1 , ..., ∂xn). we let

2.1. Diﬀerential operators. Given (x, t) ∈ Rn × R we let k(x, t)k be the unique positive solution ρ to
the equation

nXi=1

x2
i
ρ2 = 1.

Then k(γx, γ2t)k = γk(x, t)k, γ > 0, and we call k(x, t)k the parabolic norm of (x, t). Given β ≥ 0, we
deﬁne the operator Dβ through the relation

(2.2)

dDβ f (ξ, τ) := k(ξ, τ)kβ ˆf (ξ, τ),

where dDβ f and ˆf denote the Fourier transform of Dβ f and f , respectively. We deﬁne the parabolic ﬁrst
order diﬀerential operator D through D = D1. Similarly, given β ≥ 0 we let Iβ denote the operator
deﬁned on the Fourier transform side through the relation

Note that IβD = DIβ = D1−β whenever β ∈ [0, 1]. Given β ∈ (0, 1) we also deﬁne the fractional (in time)
diﬀerentiation operators Dt

β through the relation

cIβ f (ξ, τ) = ||(ξ, τ)||−β ˆf (ξ, τ).

(2.3)
We let Ht denote a Hilbert transform in the t-variable deﬁned through the multiplier isgn(τ). We make
the construction so that

β f (ξ, τ) := |τ|β ˆf (ξ, τ).

2.2. Function spaces. Given β ∈ [−1, 1] we let Hβ := Hβ(Rn+1, C) be the closure of C∞0 (Rn+1, C) with
respect to
k fkHβ := kk(ξ, τ)kβ ˆfk2.
(2.6)
We let H = H1. By applying Plancherel’s theorem we have
k fkH ≈ k∇|| fk2 + kHtDt
(2.7)
with constants depending only on n. Furthermore, we let ˜H := ˜H(Rn+2, C) be the closure of C∞0 (Rn+2, C)
with respect to

kFk ˜H :=(cid:18)Z ∞

Similarly, we let ˜H+ := ˜H+(Rn+2
+ , C) with respect to the expression in
the last display but with integration over the interval (−∞, ∞) replaced by integration over the interval
(0, ∞) only. Given F ∈ ˜H+ we let

˜E(F)(x, t, λ) = −3F(x, t, −λ) + 4F(x, t, −λ/2), if λ < 0.

(2.9)
It is easily seen that ˜E(F) ∈ ˜H and we can conclude that there is a bijection between the spaces ˜H and
˜H+. Furthermore, given F ∈ C∞0 (Rn+2, C) we see, by a straightforward calculation, that

The dual of H1/2 is H−1/2.

2.3. Deﬁnition of weak solutions. Let Ω ⊂ {X = (x, xn+1) ∈ Rn × R} be a domain and let, given
−∞ < t1 < t2 < ∞, Ωt1,t2 = Ω × (t1, t2). We let W1,2(Ω, C) denote the standard Sobolev space of
complex valued functions v, deﬁned on Ω, such that v and ∇v are in L2(Ω, C). L2(t1, t2, W1,2(Ω, C)) is
the space of functions u : Ωt1,t2 → C such that

||u||L2(t1,t2,W1,2(Ω,C)) :=(cid:18)Z t2

W1,2(Ω,C) dt(cid:19)1/2
We say that u ∈ L2(t1, t2, W1,2(Ω, C)) is a weak solution to the equation
(2.13)

||u(·, t)||2

t1

< ∞.

whenever φ ∈ C∞0 (Ωt1,t2, C). Similarly, we say that u is a solution to (2.13) in Rn+2, Rn+2
+ , if uφ ∈
L2(−∞, ∞, W1,2(Rn × R, C)), uφ ∈ L2(−∞, ∞, W1,2(Rn × R+, C)) whenever φ ∈ C∞0 (Rn+2, C), φ ∈
C∞0 (Rn+2
+ , C), respectively. Assuming
that H satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4) as well as the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates stated in (2.24)-(2.25) below,
it follows that any weak solution is smooth as a function of t and that in this case

integrable in Rn+2, whenever φ ∈ C∞0 (Rn+2, C), then
˜B(u, φ) = 0 whenever φ ∈ C∞0 (Rn+2, C),
(2.16)
where the bilinear form ˜B(·, ·) is deﬁned on ˜H × ˜H as

Similar statements hold with ˜H, Rn+2, ˜B, replaced by ˜H+, Rn+2
+ , ˜B+, where ˜B+ is deﬁned as in the last
display but with integration in λ over R+ only. In particular, whenever u is a weak solution to (2.13) in
+ , such that u ∈ ˜H or u ∈ ˜H+, then (2.16) holds or (2.16) holds with Rn+2 replaced by Rn+2
Rn+2 or Rn+2

From now on, whenever we write Hu = 0 in a bounded domain Ωt1,t2, then we mean that (2.14) holds
whenever φ ∈ C∞0 (Ωt1,t2, C), and when we write that Hu = 0 in Rn+2, Rn+2

2.4. Existence of weak solutions (in Rn+2). Consider the space ˜H := ˜H(Rn+2, C) and let ˜H∗ :=
˜H∗(Rn+2, C) denotes its dual space. Given F ∈ ˜H∗, one can arguing as a in the proof of Lemma 3.9
below and conclude that there exists a weak solution u ∈ ˜H to the equation Hu = F, in Rn+2, in the
sense that
(2.17)
whenever φ ∈ ˜H and where h·, ·i is the duality pairing on ˜H. Furthermore,

˜B(u, φ) = hF, φi

||u||H ≤ c||F|| ˜H∗ ,

for some constant c depending only on n and Λ. The solution is unique up to a constant. Throughout
the paper we let H−1 : ˜H∗ → ˜H denote the operator which maps F to u. Furthermore, arguing as in the
proof of Lemma 3.12 stated below, one can prove the following lemma.
Lemma 2.18. Consider the operator H = ∂t − div(A∇·) and assume that A satisﬁes (1.3), (1.4). Let Θ
denote any of the operators
(2.19)

∇H−1, Dt

whenever f ∈ L2(Rn+2, C), f ∈ L2(Rn+2, Cn+1). Furthermore, the corresponding statements hold with
H−1 replaced by (H∗)−1.
Remark 2.23. Naturally, weak solutions to the problem Hu = 0 in Rn+2

2.5. De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates. We say that solutions to Hu = 0 satisfy De Giorgi–Moser-
Nash estimates if there exist, for p, 1 ≤ p < ∞, ﬁxed, constants c and α ∈ (0, 1) such that the following
is true. Let ˜Q ⊂ Rn+2 be a parabolic cube and assume that Hu = 0 in 2 ˜Q. Then

and

(2.25)

whenever (X, t), ( ˜X, ˜t) ∈ ˜Qr. Given p, the constants c and α will be referred to as the De Giorgi-Moser-
Nash constants. If A is a (complex) constant matrix, or if A real then solutions to Hu = 0 satisfy De
Giorgi–Moser-Nash estimates. The following result is due to Auscher [A], see also [AT].
Lemma 2.26. Assume that H0 = ∂t − div A0∇, H1 = ∂t − div A1∇ satisfy (1.3)-(1.4). Assume that
solutions to H0u = 0 satisfy De Giorgi–Moser-Nash estimates for all p ∈ [1, ∞). Then there exists a
constant ε0, depending at most on n, Λ, and the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash constants for H0, such that if

||A1 − A0||∞ ≤ ε0,

12

K. NYSTR ¨OM

then solutions to H1u = 0 satisfy De Giorgi–Moser-Nash estimates for all p ∈ [1, ∞). Furthermore, the
same statements hold with H1 replaced by H∗1.
Remark 2.27. Based on Lemma 2.26 we can conclude that if A0 is either a (complex) constant matrix
or a real and symmetric matrix, and if A1 is as in Lemma 2.26, then solutions to H1u = 0 satisfy De
Giorgi–Moser-Nash estimates for all p ∈ [1, ∞).
2.6. Energy estimates.
Lemma 2.28. Assume that H satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4). Let ˜Q ⊂ Rn+2 be a parabolic cube and assume that
Hu = 0 in 2 ˜Q. Then there exists a constant c = c(n, Λ), 1 ≤ c < ∞, such that

Lemma 2.29. Assume that H satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4). Let Q ⊂ Rn+1 be a parabolic cube, λ0 ∈ R, and let
β1 > 1, β2 ∈ (0, 1] be ﬁxed constants. Let I = (λ0−β2l(Q), λ0 +β2l(Q)), γI = (λ0−γβ2l(Q), λ0 +γβ2l(Q))
for γ ∈ (0, 1). Assume that Hu = 0 in β2

Lemma 2.30. Assume that H satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4). Let ˜Q ⊂ Rn+2 be a parabolic cube and assume that
Hu = 0 in 2 ˜Q. Then there exists a constant c = c(n, Λ), 1 ≤ c < ∞, such that

Proof. In the following we can, without loss of generality, assume that A is smooth. Let φ ∈ C∞0 (2 ˜Q)
be a standard cut-oﬀ function for ˜Q. Let

I :=Z |∂tu|2φ4 dXdt,

and let

II =Z |∇u|2φ2 dXdt, III :=Z |∇∂tu|2φ6 dXdt.

Using that ∂tu = ∇ · A∇u, and partial integration, we see that

−I = −Z (∇ · (A∇u)∂t ¯u)φ4 dXdt

= Z (A∇u · ∇(∂t ¯u))φ4 dXdt + 4Z ∂t ¯u(A∇u · ∇φ)φ3 dXdt.

Hence,

Γ∗(y, s, σ, x, t, λ) = Γ(x, t, λ, y, s, σ)

and we note that this is then a fundamental solution associated to H∗. Based on (1.4) we let

below. In particular, the statements of Deﬁnition 2.51 are strong enough to ensure the validity of the
quantitative estimates for the double layer potential operators DHλ , DH∗
λ , underlying the solvability of
(D2) for H, H∗.
Deﬁnition 2.56. Consider H = ∂t − div A∇. Assume that H, H∗ satisfy (1.3)-(1.4). Assume that H,
H∗ have bounded, invertible and good layer potentials with constant Γ in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.51.
We then say that (D2), (N2) and (R2) are uniquely solvable, for the operators H, H∗, by way of layer
potentials and with constant Γ, if (D2) for the operators H, H∗ have unique solutions, and if (N2) and
(R2) for the operators H, H∗ have unique solutions, modulo a constant.

3. Harmonic analysis

In the following we establish a number of harmonic analysis results, and collect some results from
[N], to be used in the forthcoming sections. Throughout the section we assume that H, H∗ satisfy
(1.3)-(1.4). Recall that ∇ = (∇||, ∂λ) where ∇|| = (∂x1 , ..., ∂xn). We will also use the notation Di = ∂xi for
i ∈ {1, ..., n + 1}. We let
(3.1)
where div|| is the divergence operator in the variables (∂x1 , ..., ∂xn) only and where A|| is the n × n-
dimensional sub matrix of A deﬁned by {Ai, j}n

L|| = − div||(A||∇||)

i, j=1. Then

3.1. Resolvents and a parabolic Hodge decomposition associated to H||. Recall the function space
H = H(Rn+1, C). We let ¯H = ¯H(Rn+1, C) be the closure of C∞0 (Rn+1, C) with respect to the norm

Let B : H × H → C be deﬁned as

and let, for δ ∈ (0, 1), Bδ : H × H → C be deﬁned as

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let g ∈ L2(Rn+1, Cn). We say that a function u ∈ H(Rn+1, C) is a (weak) solution to the
equation H||u = − div|| g, in Rn+1, if

B(u, φ) =ZRn+1

¯φ dxdt,

g · ∇||

whenever φ ∈ H(Rn+1, C).
Deﬁnition 3.8. Let λ > 0 be given. Let f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C). We say that a function u ∈ ¯H(Rn+1, C) is a
(weak) solution to the equation u + λ2H||u = f , in Rn+1, if
u ¯φ dxdt + λ2B(u, φ) =ZRn+1

ZRn+1

f ¯φ dxdt

whenever φ ∈ ¯H(Rn+1, C).
Lemma 3.9. Consider the operator H|| = ∂t − div||(A||∇||·) and assume that A satisﬁes (1.3), (1.4). Let
g ∈ L2(Rn+1, Cn). Then there exists a weak solution u ∈ H(Rn+1, C) to the equation H||u = − div|| g, in
Rn+1, in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.7. Furthermore,

for some constant c depending only on n and Λ. The solution is unique up to a constant.

||u||H ≤ c||g||2,

Proof. This is Lemma 2.6 in [N]. We here include the proof for completion. Consider the functionals

Λg(φ) =ZRn+1

g · ∇||

¯φ dxdt, Λδ

g(φ) =ZRn+1

g · ∇||φδ dxdt,

φδ = (I + δHt)φ, φ ∈ H(Rn+1, C). Then Λg and Λδ
|Λg(φ)| + |Λδ

g are bounded linear functional on H = H(Rn+1, C) and
g(φ)| ≤ c||g||2||φ||H.

Consider the bilinear form Bδ(·, ·) introduced in (3.6). If δ = δ(n, Λ) is small enough, then Bδ(·, ·) is a
bilinear, bounded, coercive form on H × H. Hence, using the Lax-Milgram theorem we see that there
exists a unique u ∈ H such that

B(u, φδ) ≡ Bδ(u, φ) = Λδ

g(φ) ≡ Λg(φδ)

for all φ ∈ H. Using that (I + δHt) is invertible on H, if 0 < δ ≪ 1 is small enough, we can conclude
that

B(u, ψ) = Λg(ψ),

whenever ψ ∈ H. The bound ||u||H ≤ c||g||2 follows readily. This completes the existence and quantita-
tive part of the lemma. The statement concerning uniqueness follows immediately.
Lemma 3.10. Let λ > 0 be given. Consider the operator H|| = ∂t − div||(A||∇||·) and assume that A
satisﬁes (1.3), (1.4). Let f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C). Then there exists a weak solution u ∈ ¯H(Rn+1, C) to the
equation u + λ2H||u = f , in Rn+1, in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.8. Furthermore,

(cid:3)

1/2u||2 ≤ c|| f||2,
for some constant c depending only on n and Λ. The solution is unique.

||u||2 + ||λ∇||u||2 + ||λDt

Proof. See the proof of Lemma 2.7 in [N].

3.2. Estimates of resolvents. Let λ > 0 be given. Consider the operator H|| = ∂t − div||(A||∇||·). Let
f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C). Then by Lemma 3.10 the equation u + λ2H||u = f has a unique weak solution
u ∈ ¯H. From now on we will denote this solution by Eλ f . In the case of the operator H∗
we denote
||
the corresponding solution by E∗λ f . In this sense Eλ = (I + λ2H||)−1 and E∗λ = (I + λ2H∗

collect some estimates of quantities build on Eλ f and E∗λ f to be used in the forthcoming sections.

and let ˜Θλ denote any of the operators

Remark 3.24. Note that Eλ and H|| commute. To see this we let, arguing formally, u = Eλ f and
˜u = H||u. Then, by deﬁnition u satisﬁes u + λ2H||u = f and hence ˜u + λ2H|| ˜u = H|| f . In particular,
˜u = EλH|| f and we can conclude, by uniqueness of ˜u, that

i.e., Eλ and H|| commute. Furthermore,

3.3. Littlewood-Paley theory. We here introduce parabolic approximations of the identity, chosen
based on a ﬁnite stock of functions and ﬁxed throughout the paper, as follows. Let P ∈ C∞0 (Q1(0)),
P ≥ 0 be real-valued, R P dxdt = 1, where Q1(0) is the unit parabolic cube in Rn+1 centered at 0. At
instances we will also assume that R xiP(x, t) dxdt = 0 for all i ∈ {1, .., n}. At instances we will also
assume, which we always may by construction, that P has a product structure, i.e., P(x, t) = Px(x)Pt(t)
where Px and Pt have the same properties as P but are deﬁned with respect to Rn and R. We set
Pλ(x, t) = λ−n−2P(λ−1 x, λ−2t) whenever λ > 0. Given P we let Pλ denote the convolution operator

Pλ f (x, t) =ZRn+1 Pλ(x − y, t − s) f (y, s) dyds.

Similarly, we will by Qλ denote a generic approximation to the zero operator, not necessarily the same
at each instance, but chosen from a ﬁnite set of such operators depending only on our original choice

20

of Pλ. In particular, Qλ(x, t) = λ−n−2Q(λ−1x, λ−2t) where Q ∈ C∞0 (Q1(0)),R Q dxdt = 0. In addition we
will, following [HL], assume that Qλ satisﬁes the conditions

whenever 0 < λ ≤ cl(Q), Q ⊂ Rn+1 is a parabolic cube, k ∈ Z+, and for all f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C), f ∈

that Λλ is an operator which satisﬁes (3.33) and that there exists a constant c, 1 ≤ c < ∞, such that
(3.39)

ZF |Λλ f (x, t)|2 dxdt ≤ ce−c−1(dp(E,F)/λ)ZE | f (x, t)|2 dxdt,

(cid:3)

whenever E and F are two closed sets in Rn+1, f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C), supp f ⊂ E, and where dp(E, F)
denotes the parabolic distance between E and F introduced in Lemma 3.17. Then ΘλΛλ also satisﬁes
(3.33) and (3.34) for some integer d ≥ 0 and for some constants Γ, ˜Γ, depending only on n, the constants
Γ, ˜Γ for Θλ, and the constant c in (3.39).

Proof. That ΘλΛλ satisﬁes (3.33) is immediate from the corresponding assumption for Θλ and Λλ.
To verify (3.34), consider a parabolic cube Q ⊂ Rn+1, λ ≤ cl(Q), k ∈ Z+, and f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C). In the
following we may without loss of generality assume that k ≥ 4 as we, otherwise, subdivide Q dyadically
to reduce to this case. Given Q, λ ≤ cl(Q), we let ˆQ = 2k−2Q and write

ΘλΛλ = Θλ1 ˆQΛλ + Θλ1Rn+1\ ˆQΛλ.

Then

||Θλ1 ˆQΛλ( f 12k+1Q\2kQ)||L2(Q) ≤ c||Θλ||2→2||Λλ( f 12k+1Q\2kQ)||L2( ˆQ)

Remark 3.44. Assume that Θλ is an operator satisfying (3.33) and (3.34) for some d ≥ 0. Then, for
loc(Rn+1, C). Indeed, let QR be the parabolic cube on Rn+1 with
λ ﬁxed, Θλ1 exists as an element in L2
center at (0, 0) and with size determined by R ≫ 1. Writing

(cid:3)

and using (3.33) we see that

Θλ1 = Θλ12QR + Θλ1Rn+1\2QR ,
||(Θλ12QR)1QR||2 ≤ cΓR(n+2)/2.

Furthermore, by the oﬀ-diagonal estimates in (3.34) it also follows that

||(Θλ1Rn+1\2QR)1QR||2 ≤ c˜ΓR(n+2)/2.

By a similar argument, see also Theorem 3.9 in [AAAHK], using also that Rλ satisﬁes (3.34) for some

bounded by ||D f||2

4. Boundedness of single layer potentials

We here collect a number of estimates related to the boundedness of (single) layer potentials: oﬀ-
diagonal estimates, uniform (in λ) L2-estimates, estimates of non-tangential maximal functions and
square functions. Much of the material in this sections is a summary of the key results established in
[CNS]. As mentioned, [CNS] should be seen as a companion to this paper. We will consistently only

formulate and prove results for Sλ = SHλ , and for λ > 0. Throughout the section we will consistently
assume that H = ∂t − div A∇ satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4) as well as (2.24)-(2.25). The corresponding results
for λ < 0 and for S∗λ = SH∗
follow by analogy. Recall the notation ||| · |||+, Φ+( f ), introduced in (1.15),

ﬁnd it appropriate to consider smoothed layer potentials in order to make certain otherwise formal
manipulations rigorous. In particular, some of the estimates for these smoothed layer potentials will not
be used quantitatively, but will only serve to justify the otherwise formal manipulations. For η > 0 we
set

Proof of Lemma 4.34 (i) − (iii). (i) − (iii) are proved in Lemma 4.1 in [CNS].
Proof of Lemma 4.34 (iv). The proof of (iv) is very similar to the proof of (i) i.e., to the proof of Lemma

0,λ(x, t, y, s) is a standard (parabolic)
Calderon-Zygmund kernel uniformly in λ, λ0 and η. Hence, given (x0, t0) ∈ Rn+1, and using that the

M is the standard parabolic the Hardy-Littlewood maximal. (iv) now follows from these deductions and
by proceeding as in the rest of the proof of Lemma 4.1 (i) in [CNS]. We refer the interested reader to
[CNS] for details.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 4.34 (v). To prove (v) we ﬁrst note that N∗(Pλ(∂λSλ f ))(x0, t0) ≤ cM(N∗(∂λSλ f ))(x0, t0)
and hence we only have to estimate N∗(Pλ(∇||Sλ f )). Fix (x0, t0) ∈ Rn+1 and consider (x, t, λ) ∈ Γ(x0, t0).
We now let, as we may, Pλ have a product structure, i.e., Pλ(x, t) = Px
λ(t). In the following we let
Mx and Mt denote, respectively, the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators acting in the x and t variables
only. To proceed we note, for k ∈ {1, ..., n}, that
(4.40)
and that

λ(x)Pt

where Qx

and by Poincare’s inequality
λ−1Qx

(4.43)

Combining (4.40)-(4.43) we see that

Pλ(∂xkSλ f )(x, t) ≤ cMt(Mx(N∗(∂λSλ f ))(x0, ·))(t0)
+cMt(Mx(∇||Sδ f )(x0, ·))(t0),
||N∗(Pλ(∇Sλ f ))||2 ≤ c(cid:0)||N∗(∂λSλ f )||2 + ||∇||Sδ f||2(cid:1).

(4.44)
whenever (x, t, λ) ∈ Γ(x0, t0). Hence
(4.45)
This completes the proof of (v).
Proof of Lemma 4.34 (vi). To prove (vi) we again let (x0, t0) ∈ Rn+1 and we consider (x, t, λ) ∈ Γ(x0, t0).
We want to bound Pλ(HtDt
1/2Sλ f )(x, t). Recall that Pλ has support in a parabolic cube centered at (0, 0)
and with size λ. Consider (y, s) ∈ Rn+1 such that ||(y − x0, s − t0)|| < 8λ and let K ≫ 1 be a degree of
freedom to be chosen. Then

|g1(y, s, λ)| ≤ cKλg3(x0, t0, λ),

(4.46)

Pλ(|g1|)(x, t) ≤ cM( f )(x0, t0),

where, as usual, M is the standard parabolic the Hardy-Littlewood maximal. To estimate g2(y, s, λ), for
(y, s) as above, we introduce the function

g4(¯y, ¯s, λ) = lim

where Mt is the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator in the t-variable, as we see by arguing as in the

We therefore focus on h1(y, s, λ). Let

h3(y, s, λ) ≤ cMt(N∗(∂λSλ f )(x0, ·))(t0).

If K is large enough, then h1(y, s, λ) ≤ c˜h1(y), whenever ||(y − x0, s − t0)|| < 8λ. To estimate ˜h1(y) is a
bit tricky. However, fortunately we can reuse the corresponding arguments in [CNS]. Indeed, basically
arguing as is done below display (4.4) in [CNS] it follows that

(4.47)

Pλ(h1)(x, t) ≤ cPλ(˜h1)(x, t) ≤ cMt( ˜N∗∗(∇||Sλ f )(x0, ·))(t0).

Putting the estimates together we can conclude that

where Mt is the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator in the t-variable and M is the standard parabolic
Hardy Littlewood maximal function. To complete the proof of (vi) we let

ψδ(x0, t0) := sup

λ>δ |g4(x0, t0, λ)|

˜Vǫh(x, t) = Vǫh(x, ·) evaluated at t, where Vǫ is deﬁned on functions k ∈ L2(R, C) by

This completes the proof of (vi).

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 4.34 (vii)- (viii). To start the proof of (vii) and (viii) we note, using (2.49), that (vii) im-
plies (viii). Hence we only have to prove (vii). To start the proof, we let f = (f||, fn+1) ∈ L2(Rn+1, Cn+1)
and we again note that we only have to estimate N∗((Sλ∇||)·f||). Indeed, N∗((SλDn+1)fn+1) = N∗(∂λ(Sλfn+1))
and using that

||N∗(∂λ(Sλfn+1))||2,∞ ≤ ||N∗(∂λ(Sλfn+1))||2

we see that the estimate of ||N∗((SλDn+1)fn+1)||2,∞ follows from (i). To proceed we will estimate
N∗((Sλ∇||) · g) where we have put g = f||. Fix (x0, t0) ∈ Rn+1, consider (x, t, λ) ∈ Γ(x0, t0) and let
σ ∈ (−λ, λ). Given (x, t, λ) we let

(4.48)

E = {(y, s) : |y − x| + |s − t|1/2 < 16λ},
Ek = {(y, s) : 2kλ ≤ |y − x| + |s − t|1/2 < 2k+1λ}, k = 4, ....,

and
¯g = g1E, gk = g1Ek , k = 4, ....
(4.49)
Using this notation we set u(x, t, λ) = (Sλ∇||) · g(x, t) and we split
u = ¯u + ˜u where ˜u =P∞k=4 uk

and

We ﬁrst estimate uk(x, t, σ) − uk(x0, t0, 0) for (x, t, σ) as above and for k = 4, ..... We write

¯u(x, t, λ) = (Sλ∇||) · ¯g(x, t), uk(x, t, λ) = (Sλ∇||) · gk(x, t).

where again M is the standard parabolic the Hardy-Littlewood maximal, and then, by summing, that

|˜u(x0, t0, 0)| ≤ |˜u(x, t, δ) − ˜u(x0, t0, 0)| + |¯u(x, t, δ)| + |u(x, t, δ)|

Proof. (4.107) (i)-(iv) is Theorem 2.18 in [CNS]. Indeed, (4.107) (i) is an immediate consequence of
Lemma 4.34 (i). Using Lemma 4.70 and Lemma 4.61, we see that (4.107) (i) imply (4.107) (ii). (4.107)

In this section we are concerned with boundary traces theorems for weak solutions, weak solutions
for which the appropriate non-tangential maximal functions are controlled, and the existence of bound-
ary layer potentials.

||∇||u(·, ·, λ)||2 and ||HtDt
||ψ||2 = 1. Considering λ as ﬁxed we see that it is enough to establish the bound

Proof. Let (x0, t0) ∈ Rn+1 be such that ˜N∗(∇u)(x0, t0) < ∞ and let ǫ > 0. Consider (x, t, λ), ( ˜x, ˜t, ˜λ) ∈
Γ(x0, t0) with 0 < λ ≤ ǫ, 0 < ˜λ ≤ ǫ. Arguing as on p.461-462 in [KP], using (2.24)-(2.25) and using
parabolic balls instead of the standard (elliptic) balls, and applying Lemma 2.30, we can conclude that

(5.15)
(5.15) implies (i) and (ii). To prove (iii) we consider ψ ∈ C∞0 (Rn+1, Cn), ǫ > 0, and note that

Proof. Consider R, 0 < R < ∞, ﬁxed and let ˜QR be the standard parabolic space-time cube in Rn+2
with center at the origin and with side length deﬁned by R. We denote by ˜HR(Rn+2, C) the set of all

Using (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12) we see that the trace space of ˜HR(Rn+2, C) onto Rn+1 equals H1/2
R (Rn+1, C),
i.e., the set of all functions in H1/2(Rn+1, C) which have compact support in QR/2, the standard para-
bolic space-time cube in Rn+1 with center at the origin and with side length deﬁned by R. We let
T : ˜HR(Rn+2, C) → H1/2

R (Rn+1, C) denote the trace operator and we let
R (Rn+1, C) → ˜HR(Rn+2, C),

E : H1/2

denote a linear extension operator, see (2.11), such that

(5.26)
whenever ψ ∈ H1/2
˜HR(Rn+2, C) and H1/2

||E(ψ)||HR(Rn+2,C) ≤ c||ψ||H1/2

R (Rn+1,C),

R (Rn+1, C) and for a constant c. In particular, there is a 1-1 correspondence between
R (Rn+1, C). Using this we let, given ψ ∈ H1/2

R (Rn+1, C),

ΛR(ψ) = ˜ΛR(E(ψ)).

Then, using (5.25) and (5.26) we see that the operator norm of ΛR satisﬁes

R (Rn+1,C) ≤ cR1/2(cid:18)sup

||ΛR||H1/2

λ>0 ||∇u(·, ·, λ)||2 + sup

λ>0 ||HtDt

1/2u(·, ·, λ)||2(cid:19).

In particular, ΛR is a bounded linear functional on H1/2
R (Rn+1, C). As the dual of H1/2(Rn+1, C) can be
identiﬁed with H−1/2(Rn+1, C) we see that ΛR can be identiﬁed with an element gR ∈ H−1/2(Rn+1, C).
Combining all these facts we see that

To prove (5.30), ﬁx λ, consider 0 < ǫ ≪ λ, and let Pǫ be a standard approximation of the identity acting
only in the λ-variable. Then, integrating by parts and using the equation, we see that

To start the proof of (i) and (5.41), we let u+(x, t, λ) = SHλ f (x, t) be deﬁned in Rn+2

(v) now follows from (i) and (iii). Concerning the quantitative estimates, using Lemma 5.13 (iii), the
deﬁnition of KH and duality, we see that (5.39) and (5.40) follows once we have established (5.41).

6. Uniqueness

In this section we establish the uniqueness of solutions to (D2), (N2) and (R2). The proofs of unique-
ness for (D2) and (R2) are fairly standard and rely on the introduction of the Green function and appro-
priate estimates thereof. Our proofs of uniqueness for (D2) and (R2) are similar to the corresponding
arguments in [AAAHK] and we will therefore not include all details. However, to prove uniqueness
for (N2) we have to work harder compared to [AAAHK] and in this case we give all the details of the
proof. In the case of (N2) our proof is inspired by arguments in [HL].
Lemma 6.1. Assume that H, H∗ satisfy (1.3)-(1.4) as well as (2.24)-(2.25). Assume the existence of
solutions to (D2) and (R2). Then the solutions are unique in the sense that

(i)

if u solves (D2), and u(·, ·, λ) → 0 in L2(Rn+1, C) as λ → 0,
then u ≡ 0,
if u solves (R2), and u(·, ·, λ) → 0 n.t. in H(Rn+1, C) as λ → 0,
then u ≡ 0 modulo a constant.
(6.2)
Proof. We ﬁrst prove (i). Consider, for (x, t, λ) ∈ Rn+2
Using Lemma 4.10 we see that

by (2.24), Lemma 2.30 and Lemma 4.9. In particular, Γ(x, t, λ, ·, ·, ·) ∈ H(Rn+1, C). Hence, using the
existence for (R2) we can conclude that that there exists w = w(x,t,λ) such that

Let θ ∈ C∞0 (Rn+2

Hence, using that Hu = 0 we see that

(6.10)
Let ǫ < λ/8 and let R > 8λ. Let φ ∈ C∞0 (−2, 2) with φ ≥ 0, φ ≡ 1 on (−1, 1) and let ˜φ be a standard
cut-oﬀ for QR(x, t) such that ˜φ ∈ C∞0 (2QR(x, t)), ˜φ ≥ 0, ˜φ ≡ 1 on QR(x, t). We let

θ(y, s, σ) = ˜φ(y, s)(1 − φ(σ/ǫ))φ(σ/(100R)).

θ(y, s, σ) = 1 whenever (y, s, σ) ∈ QR(x, t) × {2ǫ ≤ σ ≤ 100R}.

for some constant c < ∞ now also depending on u. To proceed we now need, in analogy with

cent papers dealing with the construction and estimates of Green’s functions for parabolic equations
and systems. We here choose to quote some results from [DK]. Indeed, let α be the De Giorgi-Nash

constants c and κ such that

Putting these estimates together we can conclude that

Furthermore, choosing a = λ/4 in (6.15) (ii) we also see that

I3 ≤ cλR−1|||σ∇u|||+ → 0 as R → ∞.

(6.19)
Put together we can conclude, by letting either ǫ → 0, or using that u(·, ·, σ) → 0 in L2(Rn+1, C)
as σ → 0, or by letting R → ∞, that I → 0. By similar arguments, writing II = II1 + II2 + II3,
III = III1 + III2 + III3, again letting either ǫ → 0, or using that u(·, ·, σ) → 0 in L2(Rn+1, C) as σ → 0,
or by letting R → ∞ it also follows that II → 0, III → 0. In particular, u ≡ 0. We omit further details
and claim that the proof of uniqueness for (D2) can be completed in this manner.
t u) ∈ L2(Rn+1) and that u → 0 n.t in
H(Rn+1, C) as λ → 0. In this case we again express u(x, t, λ) = (uθ)(x, t, λ) as above getting three terms
I, II, III. We then split each of these terms into three terms. Choosing a = 2ǫ in (6.15) (i), applying
Lemma 5.13 with f ≡ 0, using H¨older’s inequality and standard energy estimate applied to ∇G, we then
see that

To prove (ii) we suppose that ˜N∗(∇u) ∈ L2(Rn+1), ˜N∗(HtD1/2

I1 + II1 ≤ cǫλ−(n+2)|| ˜N∗(∇u)||2 → 0 as ǫ → 0.

All other pieces can be handled as well, see for instance the proof of Lemma 4.31 in [AAAHK]. We here
omit further details and claim that the proof of uniqueness for (R2) can be completed in this manner. (cid:3)
Lemma 6.20. Assume that H, H∗ satisfy (1.3)-(1.4) as well as (2.24)-(2.25). Assume the existence of
solutions to (N2) and assume that H, H∗ have bounded, invertible and good layer potentials in the
sense of Deﬁnition 2.51, for some constant Γ. Then the solutions to (N2) are unique in the sense that

(iii)

if u solves (N2), and ∂νu = 0 in the sense of Lemma 5.20 (i) and (ii),
then u ≡ 0 modulo constants.

Assuming (6.22) for now we see, using Lemma 5.13 (i), that u → u0 n.t for some u0 ∈ H(Rn+1, C).
Using that H has bounded, invertible and good layer potentials in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.51, and
in particular that SHλ |λ=0 : L2(Rn+1, C) → H(Rn+1, C) is a bijection, and the uniqueness in (R2), see
Lemma 6.1, we see that

In particular, using Lemma 5.37 we have

Using the assumptions that ( 1
are bijections, we can conclude that u0 = 0 in the sense of H(Rn+1, C). In particular, u0 is constant a.e.,
and by uniqueness in (R2) we see that u is constant. Hence it only remains to prove (6.22). To start the
proof of (6.22) we ﬁx λ0 > 0 and we let, for R ≫ λ0 given,

To start the proof of (6.31) we note that we can apply (D2) to ∂λv. Indeed, by the deﬁnition of bounded,
invertible and good layer potentials in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.51, ∂λv = DH f for some f such that

|| f||2 ≤ c|| ˜N∗(∇v)||2 ≤ c|| ˜N∗(∇u)||2.

Using this, and again using the assumptions of Lemma 6.20, see Remark 2.54 and Lemma 8.42 below,
as well as Lemma 2.30 we see that

Consider (y, s, σ), (x, t, λ) ∈ D1. Let

(x′, t′, λ′) = (x, t, λ + 2R), (y′, s′, σ′) = (y, s, σ + 2R).

Note that (x′, t′, λ′) ∈ D2, (y′, s′, σ′) ∈ D2. Furthermore,

|v(y, s, σ) − v(x, t, λ)| ≤ |v(x′, t′, λ′) − v(x, t, λ)| + |v(y, s, σ) − v(y′, s′, σ′)|

of non-tangential limits and to establish establish the existence of the strong L2-limits. We here give
the proof only in the case of the upper half-space, as the proof in the lower half-space is the same.
Recall that DHλ = −en+1ASHλ · ∇. To establish the existence of non-tangential limits we observe that
the operator adjoint to SHλ ∇ is the operator (∇SH∗
σ )|σ=−λ and that it is enough, by (5.38) and Lemma
4.34 (viii), to prove the existence of non-tangential limits for f in a dense subset of L2(Rn+1, C). Recall
the space H−1(Rn+1, C) introduced in (2.6). Embedded in (7.1) is the assumption that SH∗
λ |λ=0
is a bijection from L2(Rn+1, C) to H(Rn+1, C). Hence, by duality we have that SH0
:= SHλ |λ=0 is a
bijection from H−1(Rn+1, C) to L2(Rn+1, C). To proceed we need a better description of the elements in
H−1(Rn+1, C) and to get this we consider H(Rn+1, C) equipped with the inner product

(u, v) :=ZRn+1(cid:0)∇||u · ∇|| ¯v + Dt

Then H(Rn+1, C) is a Hilbert space and by the Riesz representation theorem we see that
1/2gn+1 : g = (g||, gn+1) ∈ L2(Rn+1, Cn+1)}.

H−1(Rn+1, C) = {div|| g|| + Dt

Hence, as C∞0 (Rn+1, Cn+1) is dense in L2(Rn+1, Cn+1) we can conclude that
(7.13)
Using this, and given g ∈ C∞0 (Rn+1, Cn+1), we consider

L2(Rn+1, C) = {SH0 (div|| g|| + Dt

1/2gn+1) : g ∈ C∞0 (Rn+1, Cn+1)}.

DHλ f = SHλ (∂νu).

Moreover, (5.38), Lemma 4.106 and Lemma 5.20 imply that ∂νu ∈ L2(Rn+1, C). Hence Sλ(∂νu) con-
verges non-tangentially as λ → 0−. This prove the non-tangential version of the limit in (7.12) for DH
−λ f
as λ → 0+. To establish the strong L2-limits we ﬁrst note that (5.38) implies, in particular, that uniform
(in λ) L2 bounds hold for DHλ , see Remark 2.54. Thus, again it is enough to establish convergence in
a dense class. To this end, choose f = u0 and u as above. It suﬃces to show that DHλ f is Cauchy

Then u(·, ·, λ) converges n.t and in L2(Rn+1, C) as λ → 0+.

in the Dirichlet problem, Lemma 6.1 we see that Uǫ(x, t, λ) ≡ 0. Furthermore, using (7.16) we see
that supǫ || fǫ||2 < ∞. Hence a subsequence of fǫ converges in the weakly in L2(Rn+1, C) to some

Proof. Again we treat only the case of the upper half space, as the proof in the other case is the same.
Since the weak limits has already been established for ∇SHλ f and HtDt
1/2SHλ f , see Lemma 5.37, it is
easy to verify that the strong and non-tangential limits for Pλ(∇SHλ f ) and Pλ(HtDt
1/2SHλ f ) will take the
same value, once the existence of those limits has been established. Hence, in the following we prove
the existence of these limits as λ → 0+. Furthermore, using Lemma 4.34, (7.1), and the dominated
convergence theorem, we see that it is enough to establish non-tangential convergence. Using (7.1) we
see that the non-tangential convergence of ∂λSHλ f follows immediately Lemma 7.15 and a simple real
variable argument yields the same conclusion for Pλ(∂λSHλ f ). The latter proves (iii) and hence we only
have to prove (i) and (ii).

To prove (i) we ﬁx (x0, t0) ∈ Rn+1, we consider (x, t, λ) ∈ Γ(x0, t0) and we let k ∈ {1, ..., n}. Then

Pλ(∂xkSHλ f )(x, t) = ∂xkPλ(cid:0)Z λ

(7.19)

where again Qλ is a standard approximation of the zero operator. As Pλ is an approximation of the
identity we see that

n.t as λ → 0. In the following we let V f (x0, t0) denote the non-tangential limit ∂λSHλ f (x, t) as (x, t, λ) →
(x0, t0, 0) non-tangentially. Using this notation we see that

Pλ(∂xkSH0 f )(x, t) → (∂xkSH0 f )(x0, t0)

(7.20)
As V f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C) it follows, if (x0, t0) is a Lebesgue point for V f , that I2 → 0 as λ → 0. Further-
more, using Lemma 5.13 we see that

n.t as λ → 0. By Lemma 4.34 (vii), the density of C∞0 (Rn+1, Cn) in L2(Rn+1, Cn), and the fact that Qλ is
dominated by the Hardy- Littlewood maximal operator, which is bounded from L2,∞ to L2,∞, the latter
convergence continues to hold for f ∈ L2(Rn+1, Cn). Moreover, if u0 belongs to the dense class

{SH0 (div|| g|| + Dt

1/2gn+1) : g = (g||, gn+1) ∈ C∞0 (Rn+1, Cn+1)},

see (7.13), then using Lemma 7.15 and (7.21) we see that

(Dσu0 − g) dσ(cid:1)(x, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) → 0

n.t as λ → 0 and where g is the boundary trace according to Lemma 7.15. Again this conclusion remain
true whenever u0 ∈ L2(Rn+1, C) by Lemma 4.34 (viii), the density of C∞0 (Rn+1, Cn) in L2(Rn+1, Cn),
and the fact that Qλ is dominated by the Hardy- Littlewood maximal operator, which is bounded from
L2,∞ to L2,∞. Combining (7.22) and (7.23) with the adjoint version of the identity (5.43), we obtain
convergence to 0 for the term I1 as every f ∈ L2(Rn+1, C) can be written in the form f = A∗n+1,n+1h,
h ∈ L2(Rn+1, C). This completes the proof of (i).
To prove (ii) we again ﬁx (x0, t0) ∈ Rn+1 and we consider (x, t, λ) ∈ Γ(x0, t0). Given (x, t, λ) we let
(y, s) ∈ Rn+1 be such that Pλ(x − y, t − s) , 0. Then ||(y − x0, s − t0)|| < 8λ. To complete the proof we

We claim that

(7.24)

To prove this we ﬁrst note that

Pλ(g1(·, ·, λ))(x, t) → 0 as λ → 0.

where

Pλ(|g1(·, ·, λ)|)(x, t) ≤ cKλg3(x0, t0, λ)

g3(x0, t0, λ) :=

sup

sup

{z: |z−x0|≤8λ}

{w: |w−t0|≤(4Kλ)2}

|∂τ(Sλ f )(z, w)|.

Furthermore, given (z, w) as in the deﬁnition of g3(x0, t0, λ) we see, using (2.24) and Lemma 2.30, that

λ2|∂τ(Sλ f )(z, w)|2 ≤ cZWλ(z,w) |∇Sσ f (˜z, ˜w) − Pλ(∇Sλ f )(z, w)|2 d˜zd ˜wdσ.

Using this, (7.1), and arguing as in the proof of (i) and (iii), we can then conclude that (7.24) holds. To
proceed we introduce, similar to the proof of Lemma 4.34 (vi),
sgn( ¯s − ˜s)
| ¯s − ˜s|3/2 (S0 f )(¯y, ˜s) d ˜s.

ǫ→0Z(Kλ)2≤| ˜s− ¯s|<1/ǫ

g4(¯y, ¯s, λ) = lim

Then, see the proof of Lemma 4.34 (vi),

|g2(y, s, λ) − g4(y, s, λ)| ≤ cK−1Mt(N∗(∂λSλ f )(y, ·))(s),

where Mt is the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function in t only, and where we have emphasized the
presence of the degree of freedom K. In particular,

|Pλ(g2(·, ·, λ))(x, t) − Pλ(g4(·, ·, λ))(x, t)| ≤ cK−1M(Mt(N∗(∂λSλ f )(y, ·))(·))(x0, t0).

Using (7.1) and Lemma 4.34 (i) we see that the right hand side in the above display is ﬁnite a.e. Hence

(7.26)

lim sup

(x,t,λ)→(x0 ,t0,0)|Pλ(g2(·, ·, λ))(x, t) − Pλ(g4(·, ·, λ))(x, t)|

≤ cK−1M(Mt(N∗(∂λSλ f )(y, ·))(·))(x0, t0) < ∞.

However, using Lemma 2.27 in [HL] it follows that

lim sup

(x,t,λ)→(x0 ,t0,0)Pλ(g4(·, ·, λ))(x, t) = HtDt

1/2S0 f (x0, t0).

Hence, letting K → ∞ in (7.26) we can conclude the validity of (ii).

vector. In the following we let ˜ε be the (n + 1) × n matrix deﬁned to equal the ﬁrst n columns of ε, i.e.,

linear operator satisfying (3.33) and (3.34), for some d ≥ 0, and

whenever f ∈ L2(Rn+1, Cn+1), for some constant ˆΓ ≥ 1, depending at most on n, Λ, the De Giorgi-

where f = (f||, fn+1). That θλ satisﬁes (3.33) follows from Lemma 4.12 (i) and (iii). That θλ satisﬁes
(3.34) follow from Lemma 4.11. Hence, we only have to prove (8.7). To start the proof of (8.7) we

assumption, S0 := Sλ|λ=0 : L2(Rn+1, C) → H(Rn+1, C) is invertible, we can conclude that there exists
v ∈ L2(Rn+1, C) such that u = S0v. We now let v(·, ·, σ) = Sσv(·, ·) for σ < 0 so that v(·, ·, 0) = u(·, ·).
Then

||v||H(Rn+1,C) ≤ c||u||H(Rn+1 ,C) ≤ c||f||2,

by Theorem 4.106 and (8.11). Furthermore, as (S0

Below we prove Lemma 9.3-Lemma 9.5. We will consequently only establish the estimates involving
|||·|||+, A+, as the corresponding estimates involving |||·|||−, A−, can be proved analogously. Furthermore,
we will in the case of Lemma 9.3, Lemma 9.4, only give the details assuming that a = 1, and in the case
of Lemma 9.5, we will give the details assuming that a = 2 and b = 1.

In this section we prove Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 1.7. As in the statement of Theorem 1.6, and
as in Section 8 and Section 9, we throughout this section consider two operators H0 = ∂t − div A0∇,
H1 = ∂t − div A1∇. We will assume (8.1) and recall that the constant Γ0 appears in (8.1). We let ε be
as in (8.2), we assume (8.3) and we let ˜ε be as introduced in (8.4). In the following we will use the
notation

Note that by the results of Section 4 we always have, a priori, that ΦH1,η( f ) < ∞ and AH1,η( f ) < ∞

whenever η ∈ (0, 1/10) and f ∈ C∞0 (Rn+1, C).
10.1. Proof of Theorem 1.6. The proof of Lemma 10.3 is given below. We here use Lemma 10.3 to
complete the proof of Theorem 1.6. Using Lemma 4.61 and Lemma 4.70 we ﬁrst see that

(10.14) it follows that the statements in Deﬁnition 2.51 (i) − (vi) hold for H1 and for some constant Γ1,
the statements for H∗1 follow by duality. Γ1 depends at most on n, Λ, the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash
constants and Γ0. Furthermore, using this result and using (10.14), Lemma 4.34, Lemma 5.37, Lemma
7.11, and Lemma 7.18, we can conclude there exist operators KH1, ˜KH1, ∇||SH1
λ |λ=0, in
the sense of Lemma 5.37, Lemma 7.11, and Lemma 7.18. Furthermore, all these operators are bounded
operators on L2(Rn+1, C). Hence to complete the proof of Theorem 1.6 the statements in Deﬁnition 2.51
(viii) − (xiii) for H1 remain to be veriﬁed. To do this we need the following lemma.
Lemma 10.15. Assume (8.1). There exists a constant c, depending at most on n, Λ, such that if

then

(10.16)

||A1 − A0||∞ ≤ ε0,

The short proof of Lemma 10.15 is for completion included below. We here use Lemma 10.15 to
complete the proof of Theorem 1.6 by verifying the statements in Deﬁnition 2.51 (viii) − (xiii) for
H1. Let, for τ ∈ [0, 1], Hτ be the operator which has coeﬃcients (1 − τ)A0 + τA1 and let KHτ, ˜KHτ,
∇||SHτ
λ |λ=0, be the boundary operators associated to Hτ and in the sense of Lemma
5.37. Let Oτ denote any of these operators. Using Lemma 5.37 we see that any such operator Oτ is

In particular, we can conclude the validity of the statements in Deﬁnition 2.51 (viii)− (xiii) also for H1.
This completes the proof of Theorem 1.6 modulo Lemma 10.3 and Lemma 10.15. The proof of these
lemmas are given below.

10.2. Proof of Corollary 1.7. By Theorem 1.6 we have that if

then there exists a constant Γ1, depending at most on n, Λ, the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash constants and Γ0,
such that

||A1 − A0||∞ ≤ ε0,

(10.19)

H1, H∗1, have bounded, invertible and good layer potentials
in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.51, with constant Γ1.

This implies, as discussed in Remark 2.54, that we also have the for (D2) relevant quantitative estimates
of the double layer potential DH1. This, (10.19), Lemma 7.11 and the uniqueness result for (D2) in
Lemma 6.1 prove that Corollary 1.7 follows from Theorem 1.6 in the case of (D2). Lemma 7.18, and
the uniqueness result for (N2) in Lemma 6.20 prove that Corollary 1.7 follows from Theorem 1.6 in
the case of (N2). Finally, Lemma 7.18, and the uniqueness result for (R2) in Lemma 6.1 prove that
Corollary 1.7 follows from Theorem 1.6 in the case of (R2).

10.3. Proof of Lemma 10.3. Having developed many of the key estimates in the previous sections, at
this stage the remaining arguments become quite similar to the corresponding arguments in [AAAHK].
Because of this we will, at instances, be a bit brief. The proof of Lemma 10.3 is based on a perturbation
argument using a representation formula for the diﬀerence

and we leave it to the reader to verify, by arguing as in the proof of Lemma 6.5 in [AAAHK] and by
using Hardy’s inequality, that (10.29) holds. We will here show how to control E2 using Lemma 9.4.

However, now using (8.1) and Lemma 9.5, and proceeding as in the estimates of ΘR above, one can
prove the appropriate bound for ˜E111 and ˜E1. We omit further details and claim that this completes the
proof of (10.34) and hence the proof of Lemma 10.3.

10.4. Proof of Lemma 10.15. Recall that H0 = ∂t + L0 = ∂t − div A0∇. By assumption we have that
A0 satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4) as well as the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates stated in (2.24)-(2.25). We let

Az = A0 + zM, z ∈ C,

where M is a (n + 1) × (n + 1)-dimensional matrix which is measurable, bounded, complex and satisﬁes
(1.4) and ||M||∞ ≤ 1. We let
Following [A], there exists ε0 = ε0(n, Λ), 0 < ε0 < 1, such that if |z| < ε0, then Lz deﬁnes an L2-
contraction semigroup e−tLz, for t > 0, generated by Lz. e−tLz is deﬁned using functional calculus, see
[A], [AT], [K] for instance, and the map z → e−tLz is analytic for |z| < ε0. We let Kz
t (X, Y) denote the
distribution kernel of e−tLz and by deﬁnition

Hz := ∂t + Lz := ∂t − div Az∇.

ΓHz(X, t, Y, s) = ΓHz(x, t, λ, y, s, σ) = Kz

t−s(x, λ, y, σ) = Kz

t−s(X, Y)

whenever t − s > 0.
In particular, the fundamental solution associated to Hz, ΓHz, coincides with
the kernel Kz
t . Furthermore, by construction the map z → ΓHz(x, t, λ, y, s, σ) is analytic for |z| < ε0.
Assuming (8.1) we have proved that there exists a constant c, depending at most on n, Λ, such that if

then

|z| < ε0,

and it is clear that Lemma 10.15 follows. To prove (10.37) we ﬁrst note, using that C∞0 (Rn+1, Ck) is
dense in L2(Rn+1, Ck), and as we have proved (10.36), that to prove (10.37) it suﬃces to verify the

Using the bounds established we have that {g j} is a uniformly bounded family of analytic functions in
|z| < ε0 and by Lemma 5.37 (i) we have that

g j(z) → ((

Using these facts we can use Montel’s theorem to conclude (10.40). To prove (ii′) we can essentially
argue as above using instead Lemma 5.37 (iii)-(iv).

11. Proof of Theorem 1.8- Theorem 1.10

In this section we prove Theorem 1.8-Theorem 1.10 using Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 1.7.

11.1. Proof of Theorem 1.8. Consider H 0 = ∂t + L = ∂t − div(A0∇) where A0 now is a constant
complex matrix. Let

(11.1)

Q(ξ, ζ) = A0

ξk(A0

k,n+1 + A0

n+1,k)(cid:1) + A0

|| ξ · ξ

where (ξ, ζ) ∈ Rn× R and where again A0
||
Using (1.3) we see that Re A0

is the n×n-dimensional sub matrix of A0 deﬁned by {A0

i, j}n

i, j=1.

n+1,n+1ζ2 + ζ(cid:0) nXk=1
n+1,n+1 ≥ Λ−1 and that

Re Q(ξ, ζ) ≥ Λ−1(|ξ|2 + |ζ|2).

The Fourier transform, with respect to the spatial variables, of the fundamental solution associated to
H 0 equals exp(−tQ(ξ, ζ)), and taking also the Fourier transform in the t-variable we see that the Fourier
transform of Γ with respect to all variables, ˆΓ(ξ, τ, ζ), equals (Q(ξ, ζ) − iτ)−1 which of course is the
symbol associated to H 0. We let

F(ξ, τ, λ) =Z ∞

−∞

(Q(ξ, ζ) − iτ)−1 exp(−iλζ) dζ,

(ξ, τ, λ) ∈ Rn−1 × R × R+. Then F equals ˆΓ inverted in the ζ-variable only and when λ ≥ 0. In the
following we write

Q(ξ, ζ) − iτ = A0

(11.4), (11.5), and (1.3) it is not hard to see that Deﬁnition 2.51 (i)-(ii) hold for some Γ = Γ(n, Λ).
Using this, Lemma 4.34, Lemma 5.37, Lemma 7.11, and Lemma 7.18, we see that also Deﬁnition 2.51
(i)-(vii) hold. Finally, evaluating (11.4) at λ = 0 it also follows, similar to the corresponding argument
in [AAAHK], that the conditions in Deﬁnition 2.51 (viii)-(xiii) hold for H 0. An application of Theorem
1.6 completes the proof of Theorem 1.8.

11.2. Proof of Theorem 1.9. The proof of Theorem 1.9 is based on the following lemma proved at the
end of the section.
Lemma 11.7. Assume that H = ∂t − div A∇ satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4). Assume that
(11.8)
Then there exists a constant Γ, depending at most on n, Λ , such that Deﬁnition 2.51 (i)-(x) hold with
this Γ.

A is a real and symmetric matrix.

We here use Lemma 11.7 to complete the proof of Theorem 1.9. Given σ ∈ [0, 1] we let

Aσ = (1 − σ)In+1 + σA

where In+1 is the (n + 1)× (n + 1) identity matrix. Based on Aσ we introduce Hσ = ∂t − div(Aσ∇). Then
Lemma 11.7 applies to Hσ with a constant Γ which can be chosen independent of σ. Hence, by arguing
as in the proof of Corollary 1.7 we see that to prove Theorem 1.10 we only have to verify Deﬁnition
2.51 (xi) − (xiii) for H1. However, by repeating the constant coeﬃcient arguments in [B] we see that
Deﬁnition 2.51 (xi) − (xiii) holds for H0. Hence, invoking Theorem 1.6 we see that Deﬁnition 2.51
(xi) − (xiii) holds Hσ whenever |σ| ≤ ˜ε for some ˜ε = ˜ε(n, Λ). Iterating this procedure step by step we
see that Deﬁnition 2.51 (xi) − (xiii) also hold for H1. This completes the proof of Proof of Theorem
1.10.

11.3. Proof of Theorem 1.10. Theorem 1.10 follows directly from Theorem 1.9, Theorem 1.6 and
Corollary 1.7. Indeed, by Theorem 1.9 we have that H0 satisﬁes all statements of Deﬁnition 2.51. An
application of Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 1.7 then completes the proof of Theorem 1.10.

11.4. Proof of Lemma 11.7. To start the proof we ﬁrst record the following lemma proved in [CNS].
Theorem 11.9. Assume that H satisﬁes (1.3)-(1.4). Assume in addition that A is real and symmetric.
Let Φ+( f ) be deﬁned as in (1.18). Then there exists a constant Γ, depending at most on n, Λ, such that

In particular, there exists a constant c depending only on n, Λ, such that

Φ+( f ) ≤ Γ|| f||2.

whenever f ∈ L2(Rn+1, R).
In [CNS] Theorem 1.8 is proved by ﬁrst
Proof. This is Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.8 in [CNS].
establishing a local parabolic Tb-theorem for square functions, see Theorem 8.4 in [CNS] , and then
by establishing a version of the main result in [FS] for equation of the form (1.1), assuming in addition
that A is real and symmetric, see Theorem 8.7 in [CNS]. Both Theorem 8.4 and Theorem 8.7 in [CNS]
are of independent interest.

(cid:3)

Using Lemma 11.9 we see that Deﬁnition 2.51 (i) − (vi) hold. Deﬁnition 2.51 (vi) is consequence
of these estimates, Lemma 5.37, Lemma 7.11, and Lemma 7.18. Hence, to complete the proof of the
lemma it suﬃces to prove Deﬁnition 2.51 (viii) − (x) and to do this it suﬃces to prove that
