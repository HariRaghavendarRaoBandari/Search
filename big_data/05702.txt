ABSTRACT. Based on the novel notion of ‘weakly counital fusion morphism’, regular weak
multiplier bimonoids in braided monoidal categories are introduced. They generalize weak
multiplier bialgebras over ﬁelds [4] and multiplier bimonoids in braided monoidal cate-
gories [5]. Under some assumptions the so-called base object of a regular weak multiplier
bimonoid is shown to carry a coseparable comonoid structure; hence to possess a monoidal
category of bicomodules. In this case, appropriately deﬁned modules over a regular weak
multiplier bimonoid are proven to constitute a monoidal category with a strict monoidal
forgetful type functor to the category of bicomodules over the base object.

Braided monoidal categories considered include various categories of modules or graded
modules, the category of complete bornological spaces, and the category of complex Hilbert
spaces and continuous linear transformations.

1. INTRODUCTION

Hopf algebras can be used to describe symmetries in various situations. Classically,
they are vector spaces equipped with the additional structures of a compatible algebra and
a coalgebra, and they have categories of representations (modules or comodules) with a
monoidal structure, strictly preserved by the forgetful functor to vector spaces. There are
Tannaka-style results which allow a Hopf algebra to be reconstructed from its monoidal
category of representations together with the forgetful functor.

Various applications lead one to consider more general monoidal categories, which none-
theless share many features with those of the previous paragraph. One can then ask whether
they might be the categories of representations of some object more general than a Hopf
algebra in the classical sense. It turns out that this is often the case. This is perhaps rem-
iniscent of non-commutative geometry, where non-commutative algebras can sometimes
be seen as algebras of functions on some (hypothetical) “non-commutative spaces”. Or
for another example, the category of sheaves on a topological space is a topos; but any
(Grothendieck) topos can be seen as a generalized space (or as the category of sheaves on a
generalized space).

Returning to Hopf algebras, one direction of generalization is where the representations
involve an underlying object more general, or simply different, than a vector space. Exam-
ples might include modules over commutative rings, graded vector spaces, Hilbert spaces,
or bornological vector spaces [15, 18]. A uniﬁed treatment of all these situations is possible
using the notion of Hopf monoid in a braided monoidal category.

There is another direction of generalization, in which the base objects remain vector
spaces, but one generalizes to structures which are not Hopf algebras. For example, func-
tions on a ﬁnite group, with values in a ﬁeld, constitute a Hopf algebra. But if the group
is no longer ﬁnite, then the functions of ﬁnite support form neither an algebra (there is no
unit for the pointwise multiplication) nor a coalgebra (the comultiplication which is dual to

the group multiplication does not land in the tensor square of the vector space of ﬁnitely
supported functions). To axiomatize this situation, the notion of multiplier Hopf algebra
over a ﬁeld was proposed by Van Daele in [22].

Yet another generalization of Hopf algebras involves aspects of both of these types of
generalization, and proved important in the study of fusion categories [14]. The basic ex-
amples of fusion categories are categories of representations of (semi-simple) Hopf alge-
bras. In a fusion category, every irreducible object has an associated ‘dimension’, and in the
Hopf algebra case this dimension is always an integer, but in general this need not be the
case. It turns out that these non-integral cases can be seen as categories of representations
of weak Hopf algebras [9, 19]. A weak Hopf algebra is both an algebra and a coalgebra, but
the compatibility conditions between these structures are weaker than in an ordinary Hopf
algebra, reﬂecting the fact that the forgetful functor from the category of representations to
vector spaces is no longer strict monoidal. But there is a strict monoidal forgetful functor
from the category of representations of the weak Hopf algebra to the category of bimod-
ules over a certain separable Frobenius algebra, determined by the weak Hopf algebra and
called the base object. Note, however, that the monoidal category of bimodules over the
base object is not braided, so that this does not reduce to the earlier generalization of Hopf
monoids in a braided monoidal category.

A common generalization of multiplier Hopf algebras and weak Hopf algebras was pro-

posed by Van Daele and Wang in [24, 25] under the name weak multiplier Hopf algebra.

The axioms of a Hopf algebra, and all of the generalizations listed above, include the
existence of a so-called antipode. Omitting this requirement one obtains the more general
notion of bialgebra and its various generalizations. The category of representations of a
bialgebra is still monoidal, with a strict monoidal forgetful functor to the base category;
what is lost in the absence of an antipode is the ability to lift the closed structure of the base
monoidal category to the category of representations.

Weak multiplier bialgebras and multiplier bialgebras over vector spaces were deﬁned and
analyzed in [4]. Their representations are certain non-degenerate modules, and once again
the category of representations has a monoidal structure, not preserved by the forgetful
functor to vector spaces. But as in the case of weak Hopf algebras, there is still a strict
monoidal forgetful functor to an intermediate monoidal category. This time, rather than
the monoidal category of bimodules over a separable Frobenius algebra, it is the monoidal
category of bicomodules over a coseparable coalgebra constructed from the weak multiplier
bialgebra, once again called the base object.

We have recently begun the large program of studying all of these generalizations of
Hopf algebras, along with their categories of representations, not just over vector spaces
but in more general braided monoidal categories. In [5] we deﬁned multiplier bimonoids
in any braided monoidal category. Under further assumptions, we constructed a monoidal
category of representations of a multiplier bimonoid. We further developed the theory of
multiplier bimonoids in two subsequent papers [6, 7]. Then in [8] we turned to multiplier
Hopf monoids; that is, multiplier bimonoids with a suitable antipode map. The present
work can be seen as the next step of this program where we generalize the regular weak
multiplier bialgebras of [4] to more general braided monoidal categories.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we deﬁne the central notion of the pa-
per, that of regular weak multiplier bimonoid; this in turn depends on the notion of weakly
counital fusion morphism, also deﬁned in Section 2. We also discuss various duality princi-
ples for these structures, arising from symmetry properties of the axioms. In Section 3 we

study the base objects, and under appropriate assumptions we show that they admit cosep-
arable comonoid structure. While in the category Vect of vector spaces this was done [4]
under the assumption that the comultiplication is full, here we use a different assumption,
which follows from fullness of the comultiplication in the case of Vect. In Section 4 we
deﬁne and study the category of modules over a regular weak multiplier bimonoid. Under
favorable conditions we prove that it is monoidal, via a monoidal structure lifted from the
category of bicomodules over the base object. Again, in contrast to [4], this is done assum-
ing not fullness but a substitute which follows from it in the category of vector spaces. We
do not address here the analogous question about comodules over a regular weak multiplier
bimonoid. We also do not discuss the notion of antipode on a weak multiplier bimonoid
(and its bearing on the structure of the category of modules); that is, we do not study weak
multiplier Hopf monoids. Section 6 is devoted to the study of the particular case when the
braided monoidal base category is also closed, as is the case in most of our examples of
interest, but not in the case of Hilbert spaces. We discuss consequences of closedness on
the assumptions and constructions of the previous sections.

2. THE AXIOMS

The subject of this section is the introduction of the central notion of the paper: regular

weak multiplier bimonoid.

Throughout, we work in a braided monoidal category C. We do not assume that its
monoidal structure is strict but — relying on coherence — we omit explicit mention of the
associativity and unit isomorphisms. The composite of morphisms f : A → B and g : B → C
will be denoted by g. f : A → C. Any identity morphism will be denoted by 1. The monoidal
product will be denoted by juxtaposition, the monoidal unit by I, and the braiding by c.
For n copies of the same object A, we also use the power notation AA . . .A = An. The
same category C with the reversed monoidal product but the same braiding will be denoted
by Crev. The same monoidal category with the inverse braiding will be denoted by C.
Performing both these “dualities” (in either order) gives a braided monoidal category Crev.
By a semigroup in a braided monoidal category C we mean a pair (A, m) consisting of an
object A of C and a morphism m: A2 → A — called the multiplication — which obeys the
associativity condition m.m1 = m.1m. The existence of a unit is not required.

As will be explained in Section 6, M-morphisms X 9 A are related to morphisms from X
to the multiplier monoid of A whenever the latter is available.

We say that a morphism v: ZV → W in C is non-degenerate on the left with respect to

some class Y of objects in C if the map

C(X ,VY ) → C(ZX ,WY ),

g 7→ ZX

/ ZVY v1

/ WY

is injective for any object X, and any object Y in Y . Symmetrically, v is said to be non-
degenerate on the right with respect to the class Y if v.c is non-degenerate on the left with
respect to Y . The multiplication A2 m /
/ A of a semigroup A is termed non-degenerate
with respect to Y if it is non-degenerate with respect to Y both on the left and the right. If
a morphism is (left or right) non-degenerate with respect to the one-element class {I} then
we simply call it non-degenerate.

Throughout the paper, string diagrams will be used to denote morphisms in braided
monoidal categories. In order to give a gentle introduction to their use, in the following
deﬁnition we use both commutative diagrams and string diagrams in parallel to present the
axioms — this is meant to serve as the Rosetta-stone.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A weakly counital fusion morphism in a braided monoidal category C is an
object A equipped with three morphisms t : A2 → A2 (called the fusion morphism), e: A2 →
A2, and j : A → I (called the counit). We introduce the morphism

It follows by Axioms I, VIII and III that for a weakly counital fusion morphism (A,t, e, j),

m := j1.t : A2 → A is an associative multiplication:

Composing the fusion axiom (Axiom I) with j11, we obtain the short fusion equation:

(2.3)

Some further consequences of the axioms are analyzed in Appendix A.

Recall from [5] that a counital fusion morphism is a pair consisting of a morphism
t : A2 → A2 obeying Axiom I, and a morphism j : A → I such that 1 j.t = 1 j.
It is not
difﬁcult to see that for any counital fusion morphism (t, j), there is a weakly counital fu-
sion morphism (t, 1, j). Conversely, if (t, 1, j) is a weakly counital fusion morphism and
the induced multiplication j1.t is non-degenerate, then (t, j) is a counital fusion morphism.
It is easy to see that braided strong monoidal functors send weakly counital fusion mor-
phisms to weakly counital fusion morphisms. Since the braiding on C makes the identity
functor into a braided strong monoidal functor C ∼= Crev, we deduce the following
Lemma 2.2. For morphisms t : A2 → A2, e: A2 → A2 and j : A → I in a braided monoidal
category C, the following assertions are equivalent.

(i) The datum (t, e, j) is a weakly counital fusion morphism in C.
(ii) The datum (c−1.t.c, c−1.e.c, j) is a weakly counital fusion morphism in Crev.

A regular weak multiplier bimonoid in C will be deﬁned as a quadruple of weakly couni-
tal fusion morphisms which obey some compatibility conditions to be discussed next. In
developing the theory of regular weak multiplier bimonoids, we shall repeatedly use dual-
ity principles in which we move between the braided monoidal category C, and the related
braided monoidal categories Crev, C, and Crev. We shall discuss this more fully below, but
for the purpose of the following lemma, we observe that under these duality principles the
4-tuple (t1,t2,t3,t4) in C will correspond, respectively, to 4-tuples (t2,t1,t4,t3), (t3,t4,t1,t2),
and (t4,t3,t2,t1) in the other three categories; furthermore, in the last two cases, the we work
with the reverse multiplication m.c−1.

Lemma 2.3. Let A be a semigroup in C whose multiplication m is non-degenerate with re-
spect to some class containing A. Between some morphisms t1,t2,t3,t4 : A2 → A2, consider
the following relations.

t1 = t2

t2 =

t3 = t4

(2.9)

If the identity involving ti and t j holds, and the identity involving ti and tk holds, for i, j, k
different elements of the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, then also the identity involving t j and tk holds.
Proof. We only show three of the implications, all other implications follow symmetrically.

By associativity of the multiplication, (2.4) and (2.5),

t2

t2

t1

and now by non-degeneracy of the multiplication this proves (2.7). Similarly, by (2.4),
associativity of the multiplication, and (2.6),

t2

=

t4

and now by non-degeneracy of the multiplication this implies (2.8). Finally, by (2.5), (2.6),
and associativity of the multiplication,

and by non-degeneracy of the multiplication this implies (2.9).

Corollary 2.4. In the setting of Lemma 2.3, the following assertions are equivalent:

(i) Conditions (2.4), (2.5) and (2.6) hold;
(ii) Conditions (2.4), (2.7) and (2.8) hold;
(iii) Conditions (2.5), (2.7) and (2.9) hold;
(iv) Conditions (2.6), (2.8) and (2.9) hold.

Corollary 2.5. If there are morphisms t1,t2,t3,t4 satisfying the conditions of Corollary 2.4,
then any one of them uniquely determines all of the others.

Lemma 2.6. Let A be a semigroup in C whose multiplication is non-degenerate with respect
to some class containing A and A2. Let t1,t2,t3,t4 : A2 → A2 be morphisms satisfying the
conditions of Lemma 2.3. The following conditions are equivalent to each other.

By the non-degeneracy condition on the multiplication this implies (2.13).

Lemma 2.7. Let A be a semigroup in C whose multiplication m is non-degenerate with re-
spect to some class containing I and A. Let t1,t2,t3,t4 : A2 → A2 be morphisms satisfying the
conditions of Lemma 2.3. For any morphism j : A → I, consider the following conditions.

Then the following hold.
(1) Conditions (2.14) and (2.16) are equivalent to each other.
(2) Conditions (2.15) and (2.17) are equivalent to each other.

Proof. Once again, we only prove that (2.14) implies (2.16); all other implications follow
symmetrically.

By the non-degeneracy condition on the multiplication this implies (2.16).

(i) Conditions (2.14) and (2.15) hold;
(ii) Conditions (2.14) and (2.17) hold;
(iii) Conditions (2.15) and (2.16) hold;
(iv) Conditions (2.16) and (2.17) hold.

Lemma 2.9. Let A be a semigroup in C whose multiplication m is non-degenerate with
respect to some class containing I, A and A2. Let t1,t2,t3,t4 : A2 → A2 be morphisms satis-
fying the conditions of Lemma 2.3. For a morphism j : A → I satisfying the conditions in
Lemma 2.7, and morphisms e1, e2 : A2 → A2 such that

(2.18)

the following assertions are equivalent:

(i) The morphisms t1, j and e1 constitute a weakly counital fusion morphism in C;
(ii) The morphisms t2, j and e2 constitute a weakly counital fusion morphism in Crev;
(iii) The morphisms t3, j and e2 constitute a weakly counital fusion morphism in C;
(iv) The morphisms t4, j and e1 constitute a weakly counital fusion morphism in Crev.

Proof. We only prove the implications (i)⇒(ii) and (i)⇒(iv); the rest of the claims follows
symmetrically.

Let us begin with (i)⇒(iv). The multiplication in part (iv) is the opposite A2 c−1

/ A
of the multiplication m in part (i); cf. (2.17). Axiom II in part (iv) has the same form as
in part (i). Using (2.6), both sides of Axioms IV, VII, and VIII of part (iv) differ from the
respective sides of Axioms IV, VIII, and VII of part (i) by braid isomorphisms. In order
to verify the other axioms of part (iv) we have to use the non-degeneracy conditions on the
multiplication. Then Axiom I follows by

Deﬁnition 2.10. A regular weak multiplier bimonoid in a braided monoidal category C
consists of morphisms t1,t2,t3,t4 : A2 → A2, e1, e2 : A2 → A2 and j : A → I satisfying the
conditions in Corollary 2.4, Lemma 2.6, Corollary 2.8 and Lemma 2.9 (in particular, non-
degeneracy of the multiplication with respect to some class containing I, A and A2 is re-
quired).

The notion of regular weak multiplier bimonoid is invariant under two kinds of symmetry

operations:
Corollary 2.11. For morphisms t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2 : A2 → A2 and j : A → I in a braided
monoidal category C, the following assertions are equivalent.

• (t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j) is a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in C;
• (c−1.t1.c, c−1.t2.c, c−1.t3.c, c−1.t4.c, c−1.e1.c, .c−1.e2.c, j) is a regular weak multi-

plier bimonoid in Crev.

Corollary 2.12. For morphisms t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2 : A2 → A2 and j : A → I in a braided
monoidal category C, the following assertions are equivalent.

• (t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j) is a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in C;
• (t2,t1,t4,t3, e2, e1, j) is a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in Crev;
• (c−1.t3.c, c−1.t4.c, c−1.t1.c, c−1.t2.c, c−1.e2.c, c−1.e1.c, j) is a regular weak multi-

plier bimonoid in Crev;

• (c−1.t4.c, c−1.t3.c, c−1.t2.c, c−1.t1.c, c−1.e1.c, c−1.e2.c, j) is a regular weak multi-

plier bimonoid in C.

We refer to the latter three as the opposite-coopposite, the opposite, and the coopposite of
(t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j).

For a regular weak multiplier bimonoid all identities in Appendix A hold, as well as their

opposite, coopposite, and opposite-coopposite versions.

Example 2.13. If (t1,t2,t3,t4, j) is a regular multiplier bimonoid in a braided monoidal
category C in the sense of [5], whose multiplication is non-degenerate with respect to some
class containing I, A and A2, then with the identity morphism A2 → A2 as e1 and e2 it is a
regular weak multiplier bimonoid.
Example 2.14. A regular weak multiplier bialgebra over a ﬁeld, in the sense of [4], is
a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in the symmetric monoidal category Vect of vector
spaces, see [1, Theorem 1.2]. However, not every regular weak multiplier bimonoid in Vect
in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.10 is a regular weak multiplier bialgebra in the sense of [4, 1],
as axiom (vi) in [1, Deﬁnition 1.1] is not required in Deﬁnition 2.10. (We will consider an
appropriate analogue of this ‘missing’ axiom in Section 4.)

3. THE BASE OBJECTS

The key feature of the generalization of bialgebras that are known as weak bialgebras
is the structure of the categories of modules [10, 2, 20]; this remains true in any braided
monoidal category with split idempotents, not just the classical case of vector spaces. As
in the case of ordinary bialgebras, these categories of modules are monoidal. However, in
contrast to ordinary bialgebras, their monoidal structure is not lifted from the base category.
The base object of a weak bialgebra is both a subalgebra and a quotient coalgebra; we shall
usually call it L. These algebra and coalgebra structures obey the compatibility axioms of a
separable Frobenius algebra. As a consequence, the category of L-bimodules (equivalently,
L-bicomodules) is a monoidal category in which the monoidal product is given by splitting
a canonical idempotent morphism on the monoidal product of the underlying objects. The
category of modules over a weak bialgebra is monoidal via a lifting of this monoidal struc-
ture of the category of bi(co)modules over its base object L.

The above properties generalize nicely to regular weak multiplier bialgebras over ﬁelds
[4] with full comultiplication. For such a weak multiplier bialgebra A, the base object L is
no longer a subalgebra of A (but it is a non-unital subalgebra of its multiplier algebra). As
it has no unit, it can no longer be a separable Frobenius algebra. But it turns out to possess
the more general structure of coseparable coalgebra (hence it is a so-called ﬁrm algebra, see
[12]). This structure is enough for the category of L-bicomodules (isomorphically, of ﬁrm
L-bimodules) to have a monoidal structure where, again, the monoidal product is given by
splitting a canonical idempotent morphism. A suitably deﬁned category of A-modules is
monoidal via a lifting of this monoidal structure.

The aim of this and of the next sections is to extend the above results to regular weak
multiplier bimonoids in nice enough braided monoidal categories. We assume that coequal-
izers exist in our base category C and that they are preserved by taking the monoidal product
with any object; this preservation assumption is automatic if the monoidal category is closed
(see Section 6). We will also need the technical assumption that the composite of regular
epimorphisms in C is a regular epimorphism again. We consider regular weak multiplier
bimonoids A in C whose multiplication is non-degenerate with respect to some class Y
containing I, A and A2. In this section we look for further conditions under which A has a
canonical quotient L which carries the structure of a coseparable comonoid. Based on this
result, in Section 4 we present conditions for suitable A-modules to constitute a monoidal
category, whose monoidal structure is lifted from the category of L-bicomodules.
Example 3.1. In abelian categories coequalizers exist, and since every epimorphism is
regular, the composite of regular epimorphism is again a regular epimorphism. Thus any

WEAK MULTIPLIER BIMONOIDS

13

braided monoidal closed abelian category satisﬁes our assumptions. Several examples of
this type will be discussed in Section 6: the category of modules over a commutative ring
(and in particular the category of vector spaces over a given ﬁeld), and the category of
vector spaces graded by a given group.

Example 3.2. The symmetric monoidal closed category of complete bornological spaces is
not abelian, but it does have coequalizers [18, Section 1.3]. The regular epimorphisms are
those f : X → Y for which both f itself and the induced function f∗ between the bornologies
are surjective; it follows easily that the regular epimorphisms are closed under composition.

Example 3.3. Let Hilb be the category whose objects are complex Hilbert spaces and whose
morphisms are the continuous linear maps (not required to preserve the inner product). This
has ﬁnite limits and colimits, and is enriched over abelian groups, but is not an abelian cate-
gory. It is easy to see that the monomorphisms are the injective maps, and that a monomor-
phism in Hilb is regular if and only if its image is closed (equivalently, it factorizes as an
isomorphism in Hilb followed by an inner-product preserving injection). The epimorphisms
are those maps whose codomain is the closure of the image, so that the closure of the image
allows any morphism to be factorized as an epimorphism followed by a regular monomor-
phism. The cokernel q : K → Q of a morphism f : H → K can be characterized by the
following properties:
• q is surjective;
• q. f is zero;
• f corestricts to an epimorphism H → Ker(q).

In particular, the regular epimorphisms are precisely the surjections, and these are clearly
closed under composition. Furthermore, both regular monomorphisms and regular epimor-
phisms are always split: we can use orthogonal projection to construct their left and right
inverses, respectively.

/ K q /

If H and K are Hilbert spaces, their tensor product H ⊗ K as vector spaces has an inner
product, but is not in general complete. If we deﬁne H ˆ⊗K to be its completion, we obtain
a symmetric monoidal structure on Hilb [17, Propositions 2.6.5 and 2.6.12]. A cokernel di-
/ Q will be preserved by taking the monoidal product with any Hilbert
agram H f
space L provided that f ˆ⊗1 and q ˆ⊗1 obey the properties in the characterization of coker-
nels given above. The second property evidently holds and the ﬁrst one does because the
monoidal product preserves regular epimorphisms (since they are split). In order to verify
the third property, note that the monoidal product preserves epimorphisms as well. This
in turn follows from the fact that if I is a dense linear subspace of a Hilbert space K, then
I ⊗ L is a dense linear subspace of K ⊗ L, for any Hilbert space L. So if p : H → Z is an
epimorphism, then the image of the equal paths around the diagram

H ⊗ L /

p⊗1

H ˆ⊗L
p ˆ⊗1

Z ⊗ L /

/ Z ˆ⊗L

is dense in Z ˆ⊗L so that also the image of the right column is dense for any Hilbert space L.
With this preservation of epimorphisms at hand, we see that if f corestricts to an epimor-
phism p : H → Ker(q) then f ˆ⊗1 corestricts to an epimorphism p ˆ⊗1 : H ˆ⊗L → Ker(q) ˆ⊗L =

Ker(q ˆ⊗1), where the equality follows since the inclusion Ker(q) → K is a split monomor-
phism thus it is preserved by taking the monoidal product with L. This proves that the
monoidal product preserves cokernels (and hence coequalizers).

The non-degenerate morphisms in the categories of the above Examples will be inves-
tigated in Section 6. In particular, we shall see there that in the category of vector spaces
(even if graded by a given group), as well as in Hilb, any morphism which is non-degenerate
on either side with respect to the base ﬁeld — playing the role of the monoidal unit — is
non-degenerate on that side with respect to any object of the category in question.

If (A,t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j) is a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in a braided monoidal
category, then the (idempotent) morphisms e1 and e2 can be regarded as the components of
an M-morphism e: I 9 A2, cf. (2.18). Moreover, by Axiom VII for the weakly counital
fusion morphism (t1, e1, j) in C, there is an M-morphism ⊓R : A 9 A with components

They will play crucial roles in the considerations of the paper. They generalize simultane-
ously some important maps. In a regular multiplier bimonoid as in [5] they all reduce to the
composite of the counit A 9 I and the M-morphism I 9 A whose components are equal
to the identity map A → A (cf. [4, Theorem 2.11]). In particular, in an ordinary bialgebra
they reduce to the composite of the counit A → I with the unit I → A. In the regular weak
multiplier bialgebra in [4, Example 2.12], spanned by the morphisms of an arbitrary cate-
gory, one half of them reduces to the (linear extension) of the source map, the other half to
the target map. If we think of the fusion morphisms encoding some generalized comultipli-
cation as in A.9, then the above morphisms behave like generalized counits in the sense of
A.7 and its dual counterparts.

The symmetries of Corollary 2.12 permute these morphisms: taking the opposite corre-
sponds to interchanging simultaneously the morphisms with and without bar and the labels
1 and 2; taking the coopposite corresponds to interchanging simultaneously the morphisms

with and without bar and the labels L and R; ﬁnally, taking the opposite-coopposite corre-
sponds to interchanging simultaneously the labels R with L and 1 with 2. For example, the
opposite of ⊓L

Recall that if the multiplication m of A is non-degenerate with respect to some class Y then
n1 is non-degenerate on the right with respect to Y if and only if n2 is non-degenerate on
the left with respect to Y .

Theorem 3.4. Let C be a braided monoidal category in which coequalizers exist and are
preserved by the monoidal product, and the composite of regular epimorphisms is a regular
epimorphism. Let (t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j) be a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in C with
underlying object A such that its multiplication in Lemma 2.7 is a regular epimorphism and
non-degenerate with respect to some class Y containing I, A, A2 and the object L from
(3.5). Assume further that the morphism n1 of (3.6) is non-degenerate on the right with
respect to Y . Then the following hold.

(1) There is an associative multiplication m : L2 → L with respect to which n1 is an

to p.m by (2.14), while in the second diagram this is true by the ﬁrst equality in A.12 and
the non-degeneracy of n2. This proves that their right verticals are identity morphisms; that
is, e is the counit of d .

It follows by A.19, applied together with the non-degeneracy conditions on n1 and n2, that
this yields the same morphism d .
Remark 3.6. Let us recall from [12] that in a coseparable comonoid (L,d ,e ), the bicomod-
ule section m of d
is a ﬁrm multiplication in the sense of [21]. That is, it is an associative
multiplication such that

L3

is a coequalizer. Consequently [11, 3], left L-comodules can be identiﬁed with ﬁrm left
L-modules; that is, with associative L-actions x : LX → X such that

L2X

m 1

is a coequalizer. Explicitly, an L-coaction t : X → LX determines a ﬁrm L-action

and, conversely, a ﬁrm L-action x : LX → X determines a unique L-coaction t such that

commutes. There is a symmetric correspondence between right L-comodules and ﬁrm right
L-modules.

Summarizing, an L-bicomodule is the same as a left and right ﬁrm L-bimodule. To
avoid the use of unnecessary multiple terminology, in this paper we will only speak about
L-comodules (but keeping the above correspondence in mind).

Remark 3.7. Consider a regular weak multiplier bialgebra A over a ﬁeld; this includes the
assumptions that the multiplication is surjective and non-degenerate. In [4] the base object
of A was deﬁned as the image of the map ⊓L from A to its multiplier algebra. We claim that
— whenever the comultiplication of A is left full in the sense of [4, Theorem 3.13] — this
gives the same vector space as the coequalizer L in (3.5).

In this case we can write ⊓L

1(a ⊗ b) = ⊓L(a)b and ⊓R

1 (a ⊗ b) = ⊓R(a)b for all a, b ∈ A, in
terms of maps ⊓L and ⊓R from A to the multiplier algebra of A (see (6.3)). By [4, Lemma
3.8] the map ⊓L coequalizes the parallel morphisms of (3.5). Hence there is a unique
epimorphism f : L → Im(⊓L) such that ⊓L(a) = f (p(a)) for all a ∈ A. In order to see that
f is injective as well, we need to show that f (p(a)) = 0 for some a if and only if p(a) = 0.
Equivalently, ⊓L(a) = 0 if and only if a belongs to the image of ⊓R

1 .c − ⊓L
1.

By [4, Theorem 4.7 and Lemma 4.8], the non-unital algebra Im(⊓R) possesses local units;
and by (a symmetric variant of) [4, Proposition 5.2] A is a ﬁrm module over it (in the sense
of [21]). Hence for any element a of A there is an associated element b of A such that
⊓R(b)a = a. Choose a such that ⊓L(a) = 0. Then

a = ⊓R(b)a = ⊓R(b)a − ⊓L(a)b.

So we conclude that in this situation the canonical surjection A → Im(⊓L) is the coequalizer
in (3.5).

In fact, as we shall see in Section 6.3, in the category of vector spaces the morphism
n1 of (3.6) is non-degenerate on the right (with respect to the base ﬁeld, equivalently, with
respect to any vector space) if and only if L in (3.5) is isomorphic to the image of the map
⊓L. As the above considerations show, these properties hold whenever the comultiplication
of A is left full.

In this sense Theorem 3.4 gives a new insight also to regular weak multiplier bialgebras
over ﬁelds: It says that the assumption about the fullness of the comultiplication in [4,
Theorem 4.7] can be replaced by the non-degeneracy of n1.

4. THE MONOIDAL CATEGORY OF MODULES

If (t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j) is a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in a braided monoidal cate-
gory C such that all assumptions of Theorem 3.4 hold, then Theorem 3.4 says that the base
object L carries the structure of a coseparable comonoid. Consequently, whenever idem-
potent morphisms in C split, the category of L-bicomodules is monoidal. The monoidal
unit is L, with both coactions given by the comultiplication d . The monoidal product of
L-bicomodules V and W — with left coactions denoted by t and right coactions denoted by
t — is the object V ◦W occurring in the splitting

VW ˆs

of the idempotent morphism

s := VW

tt

/ V L2W

/ V LW 1e 1

/ VW .

(4.1)

(It can be regarded as the usual L-comodule tensor product, equivalently, as the module
tensor product of the ﬁrm L-modules V and W , see Remark 3.6.)

The aim of this section is to see — under the hypotheses of Theorem 3.4, and assuming
that idempotent morphisms in C split — what else is needed for the category of modules (in
an appropriate sense, see below) over a regular weak multiplier bimonoid to be monoidal
via the lifting of this monoidal structure on the category of L-bicomodules.

Throughout this section, we assume that C is a braided monoidal category in which co-
equalizers exist and are preserved by the monoidal product, and that the composite of regu-
lar epimorphisms is a regular epimorphism. We further assume that (A,t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j)

is a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in C whose multiplication m = j1.t1 is a regular epi-
morphism and non-degenerate with respect to some class Y containing A, the unit object I,
and the object L from (3.5), and closed under the monoidal product. Finally, the morphism
n1 of (3.6) is assumed to be non-degenerate on the right with respect to Y ; equivalently, n2
of (3.6) is assumed to be non-degenerate on the left with respect to Y .

Note that, without any loss of generality, we may assume that Y is closed under retracts.
Indeed, if i : Z → X is a monomorphism preserved by the functor (−)Q for any object Q
(as happens for example if i has a left inverse), and some morphism n : QV → W is non-
degenerate on the right with respect to X, then it is non-degenerate on the right with respect
to Z as well: from the composite

PV

f 1

/ ZQV 1n

/ ZW

we can uniquely recover any f : P → ZQ by post-composing with i1; applying the non-
degeneracy with respect to X to recover i1. f ; and then using the fact that i1 : ZQ → XQ is
a monomorphism.

For some results in the section, we will also need to assume that idempotent morphisms in
C split. This happens, for example, if any morphism of C admits an epi-mono factorization,
or if C has coequalizers or equalizers.

Example 4.1. In an abelian category any morphism f has an epi-mono factorization through
the image of f . This includes in particular some examples from Section 6: the category of
modules over a commutative ring (so in particular the category of vector spaces over a given
ﬁeld) and the category of group-graded vector spaces.

Example 4.2. In the (non-abelian) category of complete bornological vector spaces we can
factorize any morphism f : X → Y through the image Im( f ), computed in the category of
vector spaces. We may equip Im( f ) ∼= X /Ker(f) with the quotient bornology (which can
be different, however, from the subspace bornology of Im( f ) ⊆ Y ). Since it is complete,
this gives a factorization of f as a composite of a regular epimorphism X → Im( f ) (see
Example 3.2) and a monomorphism Im( f ) → Y .

Example 4.3. The category Hilb is ﬁnitely complete and cocomplete, so idempotents split.

Proposition 4.4. Under the standing assumptions of the section, the object A carries the
structure of a bicomodule over the comonoid L in Theorem 3.4.

Proof. By A.13 and the non-degeneracy conditions on the multiplication and n2, the left-
bottom path of

coequalizes any pair of morphisms that the top row does. So we can use the universality of

Deﬁnition 4.5. By a module over a semigroup (M, m) we mean an object V in Y together
with a morphism v: MV → V — called the action — subject to the following conditions.

• v is associative; that is, the following diagram commutes.

M2V 1v
m1

MV

v

MV

v

/ V

• v is a regular epimorphism.
• v is non-degenerate on the left with respect to the class Y .

A morphism of modules is a morphism f : V → V ′ which is compatible with the actions in
the sense of the commutative diagram

MV

v

V

1 f

f

MV ′

v′

/ V ′ .

Theorem 4.6. Under the standing assumptions of the section, for any module v: AV → V of
the semigroup A, the object V admits the structure of a bicomodule over the comonoid L in
Theorem 3.4. Any morphism of A-modules is a bicomodule morphism with respect to these
L-coactions. Hence there is a functor U from the category of A-modules to the category of
L-bicomodules which acts on the morphisms as the identity map.

the large region on the left commutes by A.13. All other regions commute by the construc-
tion of t and functoriality of the monoidal product. Since those of the top row are equal
epimorphisms, we deduce the equality of the left-bottom and right-bottom paths. Using
it in the third equality, together with the associativity of v in the ﬁrst and the penultimate
equalities, with (2.1) in the second equality, and with (2.2) in the last equality, we obtain

The left L-coaction t on V is coassociative and counital by the coassociativity and the
counitality of the left L-coaction t on A; the right L-coaction t on V is coassociative and
counital by the coassociativity and the counitality of the right L-coaction t on A; and the

the regions at the middle commute by the functoriality of the monoidal product and the
naturality of the braiding. The regions on the left and on the right commute by the con-
structions of the coactions t and t . The upper and lower regions commute because f is a
morphism of A-modules. Since v: AV → V is epi, this proves that f is a morphism of left
and right L-comodules.
(cid:3)

Our ﬁnal aim is to lift the monoidal structure on the category of L-bicomodules through

the functor U in Theorem 4.6 to give a monoidal structure on the category of A-modules.

A-module via the action

(4.4)

commutes by the second identity of A.12 applied together with the non-degeneracy of n2
on the right. The top-right path is a composite of regular epimorphisms, thus it is a regular
epimorphism, hence so is the left-bottom path. Since the left column is an epimorphism,
this proves that the bottom row is a regular epimorphism. It follows immediately by com-
mutativity of the diagram of (4.4) and the associativity of m in the top row that the bottom
row of (4.4) is an associative action.

It remains to see the non-degeneracy of the stated action on the left with respect to Y . If

coequalizes morphisms 1 f and 1g whenever vw.1c1 coequalizes f and g. The top row is
the image of the coequalizer vw.1c1 under the functor A(−) hence it is a coequalizer; we
can use its universality to deﬁne b0. It is associative by the associativity of d1: see the third
equality of A.9.

Concerning the commutativity of the diagrams of the claim, we use again the associative

commute by the construction of b0 and commutativity of the ﬁrst diagram of Lemma 4.8.
Since the left verticals are equal by the fourth and ﬁfth equalities of A.9, and the top rows
are equal epimorphisms, we deduce the equality of the right verticals; that is, commutativity
of the ﬁrst diagram of the claim. In the diagram

the bottom regions commute by the associativity of b(2). The region at the middle com-
mutes by the second equality of A.9. The triangle-shaped region at the top-left commutes
by the functoriality of the monoidal product and the triangle-shaped region at the top-right
commutes by the construction of b0. Since the morphisms of the top row are equal epi-
morphisms, we deduce the equality of the left-bottom and right-bottom paths. This proves
commutativity of the second diagram of the claim.

Assume now that idempotent morphisms in C split. Then in particular e1 — which is
equal to s : A2 → A2 of (4.1) by (4.6) — splits by some epimorphism ˆe1 : A2 → A ◦ A, via
some monomorphism ˇe1 : A ◦ A → A2; and e2 splits by some epimorphism ˆe2 : A2 → A • A,

there exist unique morphisms ˆd1 (equal to ˆe1.d1, in fact) and ˆd2 (equal to ˆe2.d2, in fact)
rendering commutative the diagrams.

Proposition 4.10. If we add to the standing assumptions of the section the requirements
that idempotent morphisms in C split and that the morphisms ˆd1 and ˆd2 in (4.7) are regular
epimorphisms, then for any modules v: AV → V and w: AW → W , the object V ◦W admits
an A-module structure too. Moreover, for any morphisms of A-modules f : V → V ′ and
W → W ′, f ◦ g : V ◦W → V ′ ◦W ′ is a morphism of A-modules too.

Proof. By our assumption on Y being closed under the monoidal product, the object VW
belongs to the class Y . Since ˇs : V ◦W → VW is a split monomorphism, it follows by our
assumption on Y being closed under retracts that V ◦W also belongs to Y .

Thanks to the commutativity of the ﬁrst diagram of Lemma 4.9, the left-bottom path

coequalizes the parallel morphisms of

/ V ◦W .

Hence we can use the universality of the coequalizer in the top row to deﬁne b. It is an
associative A-action since b0 is: see Lemma 4.9.

Let us see that b is a regular epimorphism. In doing so, we use again the shorthand

notation b(2) := A2VW 1c1 /

(where the middle region commutes by Lemma 4.8), the top row is a composite of regular
epimorphisms; hence a regular epimorphism. Since the left column is epi, this shows that
the bottom row is a regular epimorphism. Thus also the left-bottom path of the second
commutative diagram is a regular epimorphism. Since the top row of the second diagram is
an epimorphism, this proves that b is a regular epimorphism.

It remains to prove the non-degeneracy of b on the left with respect to Y . If b1 coequal-
izes the morphisms 1 f and 1g to A(V ◦W )Y for some morphisms f and g to (V ◦W )Y and

Observe that, in the category of vector spaces, the requirement that ˆd1 and ˆd2 be regular
epimorphisms becomes axiom (iv) in [4, Deﬁnition 2.1]; equivalently, axiom (vi) of [1,
Deﬁnition 1.1] that we did not require in Deﬁnition 2.10.

Lemma 4.11. Under the same hypotheses as in Proposition 4.10, the action b : A(V ◦W ) →
V ◦W , constructed in the proof of Proposition 4.10, admits the following equivalent char-
acterizations.

(1) b is the unique morphism rendering commutative

commutes by the constructions of b0 and b. All of the small regions in the left half commute
by functoriality of the monoidal product, naturality and coherence of the braiding, and

Since the regions in the left and central columns commute by functoriality of the monoidal

Theorem 4.12. If we add to the standing assumptions of the section that idempotent mor-
phisms in C split, and that the morphisms ˆd1 and ˆd2 in (4.7) are regular epimorphisms,
then there is a monoidal structure on the category of A-modules for which the functor U in
Theorem 4.6 is strict monoidal.

Proof. In view of Propositions 4.7 and 4.10, we only need to show that the unit and associa-
tivity isomorphisms of the monoidal category of L-bicomodules, if evaluated at A-modules,
are A-module morphisms.

The object L ◦ V — deﬁned up-to isomorphism — can be chosen to be V . With this

choice,

t

ˇs = V

/ LV

and

ˆs = LV 1t

/ L2V

m 1

/ LV

e 1

/ V .

The left unit constraint is a morphism of A-modules if and only if, for any A-module
v: AV → V , the resulting A action b : A(L ◦V ) = AV → V is equal to v. By Lemma 4.11 (2)
this is equivalent to the commutativity of the large central region of

around the central region commute by functoriality of the monoidal product and the asso-

is equivalent to the commutativity of the exterior of (4.8). This holds by the coopposite of
the second equality of A.21 (using that 11p11 : A4V → A2LAV is epi).

An analogous reasoning traces back the A-module morphism property of the right unit

constraint to the ﬁrst equality of A.21.

The associativity isomorphism is a morphism of A-modules if and only if, for any A-
modules v: AV → V , w: AW → W and z : AZ → Z, the actions A((V ◦W ) ◦Z) → (V ◦W ) ◦Z
and A(V ◦ (W ◦ Z)) → V ◦ (W ◦ Z) coincide (omitting the associativity constraint in the
category of L-bicomodules). These actions ﬁt the respective diagrams of Figure 1. The
rightmost regions, as well as the bottom regions on their left, commute by parts (1) and (2)
of Lemma 4.11. All other regions commute by functoriality of the monoidal product, and
naturality and coherence of the braiding. The top rows are equal epimorphisms (up-to the
omitted associativity isomorphism of the category of L-bicomodules) and the left-bottom
paths are equal by the associativity of the actions v and z, and A.2. Hence the right verticals
are equal proving the claim.
(cid:3)

Note the difference between Theorem 4.12 and [4, Theorem 5.6] in the case when C is
the category of vector spaces over a given ﬁeld: In [4, Theorem 5.6] the weak multiplier
bialgebra in question is assumed to be left full while in Theorem 4.12 this assumption is
replaced by the non-degeneracy of n1 in (3.6) on the right with respect to the chosen class
Y .

Remark 4.13. In [5], monoidality of the category of modules over a (nice enough) multi-
plier bimonoid A in a braided monoidal category C was explained by the structure of the
induced endofunctor A(−) on C. Namely, it was shown to carry the structure of a multiplier

call that a multiplier bimonad on a monoidal category is an endofunctor T equipped with a
morphism T0 : T (I) → I and natural transformations

subject to compatibility conditions in [5].

A similar explanation of the monoidality of the category of modules over a (nice enough)
weak multiplier bimonoid A is possible, in fact, but the treatment is technically more in-
volved. For this reason, we sketch here the construction without a detailed proof; leaving
the technicalities to the interested reader.

In the setting of Theorem 3.4, the base object L of a regular weak multiplier bimonoid A
carries the structure (d ,e , m ) of a coseparable comonoid; so in particular that of a semigroup
m : L2 → L. Using the braiding in the base category, any L-bicomodule can equivalently be
regarded as a left comodule over the monoidal product comonoid LLop, where Lop is the
comonoid with the same underlying object L, the same counit e but the opposite comultipli-
cation c−1.d . The comonoid LLop inherits a coseparable structure of L. Hence as explained
in Remark 3.6, any left LLop-comodule can equivalently be regarded as a ﬁrm left module
over the monoidal product semigroup LLop, where the semigroup Lop has the same under-
lying object L and opposite multiplication m .c. This yields an isomorphism between the
category of L-bicomodules and the category of ﬁrm left LLop-modules. Since the category
of L-bicomodules is monoidal — via the monoidal product ◦ and the monoidal unit L —
this isomorphism induces a monoidal structure — also to be denoted by (◦, L) — on the
category of ﬁrm left LLop-modules.

For a regular weak multiplier bimonoid A, in addition to the L-actions n1 and n2 in (3.6),

we can introduce two more actions

with each other. Hence they make A an LLop-bimodule, with the left and right actions

There is an important difference between the left and right actions. In the setting of Propo-
sition 4.4, n1 and n1 are ﬁrm actions: they correspond (in the way described in Remark
3.7) to the coactions t and c−1. ¯t , respectively. On the contrary, n2 and n2 need not be so
without further assumptions. In other words, the LLop-bimodule A is ﬁrm on the left but not
necessarily on the right.

Take now any left LLop-module X (with action x: L2X → X). We can deﬁne an object
A ⊠ X as the usual LLop-module tensor product of the right LLop-module A and the left
LLop-module X; that is, as the coequalizer

The ﬁrm left LLop-action n1.1n1 on A induces a ﬁrm left LLop-action on A ⊠ X (regardless
the properties of the left LLop-module X). In particular, there is an endofunctor A ⊠ (−) on
the category of ﬁrm left LLop-modules.

Now the endofunctor A ⊠ (−) on the monoidal category of ﬁrm left LLop-modules can be
equipped with the structure of a multiplier bimonad. For any left LLop-modules X and Y ,
the structure morphisms of this multiplier bimonad are constructed using the universality

5. UNIQUENESS OF THE IDEMPOTENT MORPHISMS AND THE COUNIT OF A REGULAR

1 and the
multiplications j1.t1 and j′1.t′
1 are equal and non-degenerate with respect to some class
containing I, A, and A2, then t2 = t′

ﬁnd criteria for the uniqueness of the remaining structure e1, e2, j. The ﬁndings below
generalize [25, Lemma 3.3] and [4, Theorem 2.8] .

degenerate with respect to some class of objects containing I, A and A2. Then the following
hold.

Proof. (1) It follows by A.4 and the non-degeneracy of m with respect to A that the left-

(3) The left-bottom path of the ﬁrst diagram in part (1) is a left A-module morphism
by (2.2). Hence so is the top-right path. Since 11m: A4 → A3 is also left A-linear and
epi, this proves commutativity of the ﬁrst diagram. The second diagram commutes by the
opposite-coopposite reasoning.

(cid:3)

Theorem 5.2. Let C be a braided monoidal category in which coequalizers are preserved
by the monoidal product. Let (t1,t2,t3,t4, e1, e2, j) and (t1,t2,t3,t4, e′
2, j′) be regular weak
multiplier bimonoids in C such that the induced multiplications m := j1.t1 and m′ := j′1.t1
are equal regular epimorphisms and non-degenerate with respect to some class of objects
containing I, A and A2. Then the following are equivalent.

1, e′

(i) e1 = e′
1,
(ii) e2 = e′
2,
(iii) g = g′,
(iv) j = j′.

These equivalent assertions hold true if in addition idempotent morphisms in C split and the
morphisms ˆd1 (or ˆd2) of (4.7) are epimorphisms both for the unprimed and for the primed
data.

Proof. (i) ⇔ (ii). This follows by (2.18), applied both to the unprimed and the primed data,
and the non-degeneracy of m = m′ with respect to A.

(i) ⇔ (iii). This follows by the ﬁrst diagram in part (2) of Lemma 5.1, applied both to

the unprimed and the primed data, and the non-degeneracy of m = m′ with respect to A.

(iv) ⇒ (iii). If (iv) holds then the left-bottom path of the ﬁrst diagram of Lemma 5.1 (1)
is the same for the primed and for the unprimed data. Then so is the top-right path. Since
1m and 1m′ are equal epimorphisms, this proves g = g′.

(iii) ⇒ (iv). This follows by the the fact that m and m′ are equal epimorphisms and the

calculation

j.m′ (2.14)

= j′ j.t1 = j′ j.g (iii)

= j′ j.g′ = j′ j.t2

(2.15)
= j′.m,

in which the unlabelled equalities hold by Lemma 5.1(4).

Assume now that idempotent morphisms in C split. The morphisms d1 of A.9, built up
from the unprimed and from the primed data, are the same. Applying the last equality of
A.9 to the unprimed and the primed data, respectively, we get

e1.d1 = d1

e′
1.d1 = d1.

(5.1)

Using the second equality, we obtain the equivalent expressions of d1 in

d1 = e′

1. ˆd′
1.

1.d1 = ˇe′

1. ˆe′

1.d1 = ˇe′

Substituting this expression of d1 in the ﬁrst equality of (5.1), we get e1. ˇe′
Since ˆd′

1. ˆd′
1.
1 equalizes e1 and 1. Thus universality of

1 is epi by assumption, this shows that ˇe′

yields a morphism f as in the diagram. It is an isomorphism with the inverse constructed
by a symmetrical reasoning.

Post-composing the morphisms around the triangle of (5.2) by ˆe′

equality and commutativity of the triangular region of (5.2) in the second one, we obtain

1. ˇe1 is the inverse of f and therefore f . ˆe′

Since e1 on the right hand side is the ﬁrst component of an M-morphism A2 9 A2 by (2.18),
1.e1 on the left hand side. The M-morphism with ﬁrst component e1 = e′
so must be e′
1.e1
has e2 = e2.e′

6. WORKING IN A CLOSED BRAIDED MONOIDAL CATEGORY

In this ﬁnal section we assume that the braided monoidal category C is also closed and in-
vestigate the consequences of this on the assumptions and the constructions of the previous
sections.

A braided monoidal category C is said to be closed if, for any object X, the func-
tor X (−) : C → C possesses a right adjoint, to be denoted by [X , −] (this is equivalent
to (−)X ∼= X (−) possessing a right adjoint). The unit and the counit of the adjunction
X (−) ⊣ [X , −] will be denoted by coev and ev, respectively.

Since any left adjoint functor preserves coequalizers, in a closed braided monoidal cate-

gory coequalizers are preserved by taking the monoidal product with any object.

6.1. The multiplier monoid. In this section we recall some background material from [6].
Consider the images of the morphisms

under the adjunction isomorphism C(A2[A, A], A) ∼= C([A, A], [A2, A]). If their pullback ex-
ists, as it will in any abelian category, then we call it the multiplier monoid of A (a term
justiﬁed by the veriﬁcation of its monoid structure in [6]) and we denote it by M(A) as in
the ﬁrst diagram of

Using the adjunction isomorphism C(M(A), [A2, A]) ∼= C(A2M(A), A), the ﬁrst diagram in
(6.1) translates to the second one, involving the morphisms ( M(A)A h1
AM(A)
)
with the universal property that for any object X, the morphisms f : X → M(A) correspond
bijectively to pairs of morphisms ( XA f1

) such that

commutes; that is f1 and f2 are components of an M-morphism X 9 A. We call f1 and
f2 the components also of the corresponding morphism f : X → M(A) in C. Explicitly,
the correspondence between f : X → M(A) and its components ( f1, f2) is expressed by the
commutative diagrams

(6.3)

The pair ( M(A)A h1

AM(A)

) in (6.1) can be regarded as the components of

the identity morphism M(A) → M(A). By the associativity of m, ( A2 m /
are components of a morphism i : A → M(A).

/ A

mo

)

Proposition 6.1. If the pullback M(A) exists for a semigroup A with non-degenerate multi-
plication m, then h1 in (6.3) is non-degenerate on the right and h2 in (6.3) is non-degenerate
on the left.

Proof. For morphisms f , g : X → M(A), it follows by (6.2) that f1 = h1. f 1 and g1 = h1.g1
are equal if and only if f2 = h2.1 f and g2 = h2.1g are equal. If this is the case, then f = g
by the universality of the pullback.
(cid:3)

In the category of vector spaces, the non-degeneracy properties of h1 and h2 in Proposi-

tion 6.1 are referred to as the density of A in M(A), see [13].

Corollary 6.2. For a semigroup A satisfying the conditions in Proposition 6.1, and some
morphism f : X → M(A), the following are equivalent.

• f is a monomorphism,
• f1 is non-degenerate on the right,
• f2 is non-degenerate on the left.

In particular, for such a semigroup A, the morphism i : A → M(A) — whose components
are equal to m — is a monomorphism.

6.2. A distinguished class of objects. In a closed braided monoidal category C, we can
make the following choice of a class Y of objects in C. Let Y contain those objects Y in C
which obey the following properties.

(a) The functor Y (−) : C → C preserves monomorphisms.

(b) For any objects X and Z of C, q := [X , Z]Y coev /

/ [X , X [X , Z]Y]

[X,ev1]

/ [X , ZY ]

is a

monomorphism.

Example 6.3. In the closed symmetric monoidal category of modules over a commutative
ring, property (a) characterizes the ﬂat modules Y . Property (b) holds for locally projective
[27] modules Y . Since locally projective modules are also ﬂat, all locally projective (so in
particular all projective) modules belong to the class Y .

From this immediately follows the following.

Example 6.4. In the closed symmetric monoidal category of vector spaces, every object
belongs to the class Y .

More generally, we shall see that in the closed symmetric monoidal category of group
graded vector spaces every object belongs to the class Y . We do this in the following,
still more general, setting. Let C be a closed braided monoidal category and let G be a co-
commutative bimonoid in it. Then the category CG of G-comodules (that is, the Eilenberg-
Moore category of the comonad G(−) on C) is a braided monoidal category (via the braided
monoidal structure lifted from C). Consequently, in this case any G-comodule Z z
/ GZ
induces a commutative diagram

CG Z(−)

CG

U

C

U

/ C

Z(−)

(6.4)

in which U denotes the forgetful functor and in which U and Z(−) in the bottom row are
left adjoint functors. Then it follows by a dual version of the Adjoint Lifting Theorem [16,
Theorem 2] that there is an adjunction Z(−) ⊣ JZ, −K: CG → CG whenever the equalizer

JZ,Y K

/ G[Z, GY ]

/ GY , where ez is the mate of z under
in C exists, for any G-comodules Z z
the adjunction Z(−) ⊣ [Z, −] : C → C. In particular, CG is closed whenever equalizers of
coreﬂexive pairs exist in C.

/ GZ and Y y

Proposition 6.5. Consider a closed braided monoidal category C in which the equalizers
of coreﬂexive pairs exist. Let G be a cocommutative Hopf monoid in C such that the functor
/ GZ of CG belongs to the
G(−) : C → C preserves monomorphisms. Then an object Z z
class Y in the closed braided monoidal category CG whenever Z belongs to Y in C.

Proof. Property (a). By the assumption that G(−) : C → C preserves monomorphisms, so
does the forgetful functor U : CG → C and therefore the equal paths around the diagram of
(6.4). Since U is faithful it also reﬂects monomorphisms proving that the functor in the top
row of (6.4) preserves monomorphisms.

Property (b). Denote by d : G → G2, e : G → I and m : G2 → G the comultiplication, the
counit and the multiplication of the Hopf monoid G, respectively, and for any G-comodules

is an isomorphism since G is a Hopf monoid. Since the object Z of C belongs to Y ,
q : [X ,Y ]Z → [X ,Y Z] is a monomorphism. The bottom row is its image under the functor
G(−) hence it is a monomorphism. The left pointing arrow of the top row is the image of
the (regular) monomorphism g under the functor G(−) hence it is a monomorphism. Thus
the left path around the diagram is a monomorphism, proving that also the right pointing
path of the top row is a monomorphism.
(cid:3)

Since the category of vector spaces graded by a group G is isomorphic to the abelian cat-
egory of comodules over the cocommutative Hopf algebra spanned by G, from Proposition
6.5 and Example 6.4 we obtain the following.

Example 6.6. In the closed symmetric monoidal category of group graded vector spaces
every object belongs to the class Y .

Example 6.7. In any closed braided monoidal category, an object which possesses a (left,
equivalently, right) dual, belongs to the class Y . Indeed, if V ∗ is the dual of some object V ,
then the functor V ∗(−) ∼= [V, −] is right adjoint, hence it preserves monomorphisms proving
property (a). The canonical morphism q in part (b) is equal to the composite

/ [X , [V,Y ]]

hence it is an isomorphism, for any objects X ,Y .
Example 6.8. In the closed symmetric monoidal category of complete bornological vector
spaces [15, 18], any object Y obeying the approximation property belongs to the class Y .
Indeed, property (a) is asserted in Lemma 2.2 of [26], whose Lemma 2.3 discusses a partic-
ular case of property (b) (when Z is the base ﬁeld). A similar reasoning yields property (b)
also for any complete bornological vector spaces X and Z; and Y with the approximation
property.

Lemma 6.9. The full subcategory of C with objects in Y , is a monoidal subcategory. That
is, the following assertions hold.

(1) The monoidal unit belongs to Y .
(2) If both objects Y and Y ′ belong to Y then so does their monoidal product YY ′.

Proof. (1) follows since I(−) is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor and for Y = I
the morphism q is an isomorphism built from the right unit constraints.

(2) Property (a) holds since YY ′(−) is naturally isomorphic to the composite of the func-
tors Y ′(−) and Y (−). In order to see that property (b) holds, note ﬁrst commutativity of the

Proposition 6.11. For any morphism v: ZV → W in C, the following assertions are equiv-
alent.

/ [Z,WY ] is a monomorphism.

Proof. Composing the map of part (iii) with the isomorphism C(ZX ,WY ) ∼= C(X , [Z,WY ]),
we obtain C(X , [Z, v1].coev). This proves (iii)⇔(iv). Applying it to Y = I proves (i)⇔(ii).

(iv)⇒(ii) follows by Lemma 6.9 (1) putting Y = I.
(ii)⇒(iv). The diagram

commutes by the naturality of q and (6.5). The top row is mono by (ii) and the fact that
(−)Y ∼= Y (−) preserves monos. Since the right vertical is also mono, this proves that the
bottom row is so.

6.3. The base object of a regular weak multiplier bimonoid. If the semigroup A under-
lying a regular weak multiplier bimonoid in a closed braided monoidal category C admits a
multiplier monoid M(A), then the M-morphisms with components in (3.1), (3.2), (3.3) and
(3.4) determine morphisms ⊓R, ⊓L, ⊓L and ⊓R, respectively, all of them from A to M(A).
Furthermore, the components n1 and n2 in (3.6) of an M-morphism L 9 A determine a

morphism n : L → M(A). It obeys

h1.n1.p1 = n1.p1 = ⊓L

1 = h1. ⊓L 1.

Hence by the non-degeneracy of h1 on the right (see Proposition 6.1), ⊓L factorizes through
the regular epimorphism p via the morphism n. This morphism n is monic if and only if n1
is non-degenerate on the right (see Corollary 6.2).

Consider a regular weak multiplier bialgebra over a ﬁeld (that is, a regular weak mul-
tiplier bimonoid A in the closed symmetric monoidal category of vector spaces such that
the morphisms ˆd1 and ˆd2 in (4.7) are surjective; i.e. regular epimorphisms). Under the
additional assumption that A is left full, we saw in Remark 3.7 that p : A → L differs by an
isomorphism from the corestriction of ⊓L to A → Im(⊓L). Since n : L → M(A) differs by
the same isomorphism from the canonical inclusion Im(⊓L) → M(A), we conclude that in
this case n is a monomorphism, equivalently, n1 is non-degenerate on the right (with respect
to any vector space, see Proposition 6.11 and Example 6.4).

6.4. Non-degeneracy in the category of Hilbert spaces. Although the category Hilb of
complex Hilbert spaces and continuous maps in Example 3.3 is not closed, the ﬁndings of
this section can be used to describe non-degenerate morphisms therein.
Proposition 6.12. Let n : Z ˆ⊗V → W be a morphism in Hilb, and write i : Z ⊗V → Z ˆ⊗V
for the canonical inclusion. The following conditions are equivalent:

(i) Z ˆ⊗V n
(ii) Z ⊗V i
(iii) Z ⊗V i

/ W is non-degenerate in Hilb.
/ Z ˆ⊗V n
/ Z ˆ⊗V n

/ W is non-degenerate in Vect.
/ W is non-degenerate in Vect with respect to the class of all

complex vector spaces.

(iv) Z ˆ⊗V n

/ W is non-degenerate in Hilb with respect to the class of all complex

Hilbert spaces.

Proof. (i)⇒(ii). By hypothesis, the map Hilb(X ,V ) → Hilb(Z ˆ⊗X ,W ),

f 7→ Z ˆ⊗X

1 ˆ⊗ f

/ Z ˆ⊗V

n

/ W

is injective. We should prove that the map Vect(X ,V ) → Vect(Z ⊗ X ,W ),

f 7→ Z ⊗ X

1⊗ f

/ Z ⊗V

i

/ Z ˆ⊗V

n

/ W

(6.6)

(6.7)

is injective for every complex vector space X. But, due to the fact that vector spaces are
all direct sums of copies of the base ﬁeld, and that the algebraic tensor product preserves
direct sums, we see that it is enough to check the injectivity for X = C. Now, C is certainly
a Hilbert space, and every linear map f : C → V is continuous. Since Z ˆ⊗C = Z ⊗ C, we see
that the injectivity of (6.7) for X = C follows from that of (6.6). Thus, n .i is non-degenerate.

(ii)⇒(iii). This holds by Proposition 6.11 and Example 6.4.
(iii)⇒(iv). By hypothesis, the map Vect(X ,V ⊗Y ) → Vect(Z ⊗ X ,W ⊗Y ),

f 7→ Z ⊗ X

1⊗ f

/ Z ⊗V ⊗Y i⊗1

/ (Z ˆ⊗V ) ⊗Y

n ⊗1

/ W ⊗Y

is injective for all complex vector spaces X ,Y , and we should prove that also the map
Hilb(X ,V ˆ⊗Y ) → Hilb(Z ˆ⊗X ,W ˆ⊗Y ),

f 7→ Z ˆ⊗X

1 ˆ⊗ f

/ Z ˆ⊗V ˆ⊗Y

n ˆ⊗1

/ W ˆ⊗Y

(6.8)

is injective for all Hilbert spaces X ,Y . But the map Hilb(Z ˆ⊗X ,W ˆ⊗Y ) → Vect(Z ⊗X ,W ˆ⊗Y )
is injective, so it will sufﬁce to show that the composite of (6.8) with this last map is injec-
tive; and for that, it clearly sufﬁces to prove the case where X = C.

Thus we need to prove that the induced map V ˆ⊗Y → Vect(Z,W ˆ⊗Y ) is injective, or

equivalently that for z ∈ Z the maps

V ˆ⊗Y z ˆ⊗−

prove one identity in each group; all the others follow symmetrically.
