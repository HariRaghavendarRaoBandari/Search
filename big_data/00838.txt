Abstract

We present an axiomatization of Conway theories which yields, as a corollary, a very
concise axiomatization of iteration theories satisfying the functorial implication for base
morphisms.

It has been shown that most ﬁxed point operations in computer science share the same equa-
tional properties. These equational properties are captured by the notion of iteration theories
[1, 3]. Several axiomatizations of iteration theories have been presented in [2, 3]. For a recent
overview, we refer to [6].

The axioms of iteration theories can be conveniently divided into two groups: axioms for
Conway theories and the commutative identities. The commutative identities have later been
simpliﬁed to the group identities or certain generalized power identities, cf.
[4, 5, 7]. In this
note, we provide further axiomatizations of Conway and iteration theories, see Corollaries 3,4
and 5.

Iteration theories having a constructable ﬁxed point operation (such as the theories of mono-
tonic or continuous functions over a cpo or a complete lattice equipped with the least ﬁxed
point operation, or the theories of continuous functors over ω-categories equipped with the
initial ﬁxed point operation) usually satisfy the ‘functorial implication’ for base morphisms,
see [2]. In fact, the commutative identities were introduced in [3] as a strictly weaker, but fully
equational substitute for the functorial implication for (surjective) base morphisms, which are
however still suﬃcient for completeness. As a corollary of our results, we obtain a simple ax-
iomatization of iteration theories with a functorial dagger for base morphisms, cf. Corollary 6.

We assume familiarity with Conway and iteration theories and closely follow the terminology
and notation in [2].

Proposition 1 Let T be a preiteration theory. Then T is a Conway theory iﬀ T satisﬁes the
(base) parameter, ﬁxed point, permutation and double dagger identities as well as the following
identity:

(1n ⊕ 0m) · hf · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p), gi† = f †,

where f : n → n + p and g : m → n + m + p.

Proof. It is known that all identities mentioned in the proposition hold in Conway theories, see
the summary on p. 212 and Proposition 3.18 on p. 134 in [2]. Suppose now that the identities
mentioned in the proposition hold. We prove that the pairing identity

hf, gi† = hf † · hh†, 1pi, h†i

(2)

holds for all f : n → n + m + p and g : m → n + m + p, where

h = g · hf †, 1m+pi : m → m + p.

We follow closely the argument on p. 164 and 165 in [2]. The diﬀerence is that we use (1)
instead of the ‘simpliﬁed composition identity’.

First, we establish the pairing identity in two special cases. The ﬁrst special case is

hf · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p), g · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p)i† = hf †, g · hf †, 1pii,

where f : n → n + p and g : m → n + p. Indeed, let h = hf · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p), g · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p)i,
then

by (1), so that h† = hf †, ki for some k : m → p. Hence,

(1n ⊕ 0m) · h† = f †

h† = h · hh†, 1pi

= hf · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p), g · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p)i · hf †, k, 1pi
= hf · hf †, 1pi, g · hf †, 1pii
= hf †, g · hf †, 1pii

by the ﬁxed point identity.

The second special case is

h0n ⊕ f, 0n ⊕ gi† = hf · hg†, 1pi, g†i,

where f : n → m + p and g : m → n + p. This follows from the ﬁrst special case using the per-
mutation identity (or the block transposition identity which is an instance of the permutation
identity).

Now using the two special cases, the pairing identity (2) in full generality is established exactly
as on p. 165 of [2].

Let f : n → n+m+p and g : m → n+m+p, and deﬁne h = g·hf †, 1m+pi and τ = h1n+m, 1n+mi.
Then

hf, gi† = (hf · (1n ⊕ 0m+n ⊕ 1m+p), g · (1n ⊕ 0m+n ⊕ 1m+p)i · (τ ⊕ 1p))†

= hf · (1n ⊕ 0m+n ⊕ 1m+p), g · (1n ⊕ 0m+n ⊕ 1m+p)††,

by the double dagger identity,

= h0n ⊕ f †, g · h0n ⊕ f †, 0n ⊕ 1m+pii†,

by the ﬁrst special case and the (base) parameter identity,

= h0n ⊕ f †, 0n ⊕ hi†
= hf † · hh†, 1pi, h†i,

by the second special case.

✷

Suppose that T is a preiteration theory and C is a set of morphisms in T . Following [2], we
say that T satisﬁes the functorial implication for C if for all f : n → n + p and g : m → m + p
in T and ρ : n → m in C,

f · (ρ ⊕ 1p) = ρ · g ⇒ f † = ρ · g†.

Lemma 2 Let T be a preiteration theory. Then the functorial implication holds in T for
injective base morphisms iﬀ the permutation identity and (1) hold.

Proof. First note that permutation identity is equivalent to the special case of the functorial
implication when ρ is a base permutation. If the permutation identity and (1) hold in T , then so
does the functorial implication for injective base morphisms by the proof of Proposition 3.24 on
p. 137 in [2]. Suppose now that the functorial implication holds for injective base morphisms.
Then, as noted above, the permutation identity holds. To prove that (1) holds, suppose that
f : n → n + p and g : m → n + m + p, and let h = hf · (1n ⊕ 0m ⊕ 1p), gi : n + m → n + m + p.
Then letting ρ = 1n ⊕ 0m, we have

so that

f · (ρ ⊕ 1p) = ρ · h,

f † = ρ · h†

by the functorial implication for injective base morphisms.

✷

It is known that the permutation identity holds in a preiteration theory iﬀ the block transpo-
sition identity does. This is due to the fact that every permutation [n] → [n] can be written as
a composition of block transpositions, and if the permutation identity holds for bijective base
morpisms π1, π2 : n → n, then it also holds for π1 · π2 : n → n.

Corollary 3 A preiteration theory T is a Conway theory iﬀ the (base) parameter, ﬁxed point,
double dagger and permutation (or block transposition) identities and (1) hold in T .

Proof. For one direction, recall that one of the axiomatizations of Conway theories consists of
the left zero, right zero, pairing and permutation identities, cf. p. 212 in [2]. But the left zero
identity is an instance of the ﬁxed point identity, the right zero identity is an instance of the
(base) parameter identity and the permutation identity follows from the functorial implication

for injective base morphisms. Moreover, the functorial implication for injective base morphisms
follows from the block transposition identity and (1) as shown in Lemma 2.

For the other direction, recall that all properties mentioned in the corollary hold in Conway
theories.
✷

Corollary 4 A preiteration theory T is a Conway theory iﬀ the (base) parameter, ﬁxed point,
double dagger identities and the functorial implication for injective base morphisms hold in T .

Corollary 5 A preiteration theory T is an iteration theory iﬀ it satisﬁes the ﬁxed point, (base)
parameter and double dagger identities and the functorial implication for injective base mor-
phisms, moreover, it satisﬁes

• the commutative identities [3, 2] or

• the group identities [4], or

• the generalized power identities [5, 7].

Corollary 6 A preiteration theory T is an iteration theory satisfying the functorial implication
for base morphisms iﬀ the ﬁxed point, (base) parameter and double dagger identities hold in T
and T satisﬁes the functorial dagger implication for base morphisms.
