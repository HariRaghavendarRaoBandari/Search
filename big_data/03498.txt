A REMARK ON IMAGINARY PART OF RESONANCE POINTS

NURULLA AZAMOV

Abstract. In this paper we prove for rank one perturbations that negative two times reciprocal
of the imaginary part of resonance point is equal to the rate of change of the scattering phase
as a function of the coupling constant, where the coupling constant is equal to the real part of
the resonance point. This equality is in agreement with Breit-Wigner formula from quantum
scattering theory.

1. Introduction

Given a self-adjoint operator H0 and a relatively compact self-adjoint operator V, a resonance

point rz of the triple (z; H0, V ) is a pole of the meromorphic function

s 7→ Rz(Hs)V,

where Hs = H0 + sV. Under certain conditions on the pair (H0, V ), which ensure existence of
scattering theory (the limiting absorption principle), resonance points rz have limit values rλ+i0
for a.e. λ ∈ R. In case rλ+i0 is real, it has several interpretations, discussed in details in the
introduction of [Az2]. One of the interpretations is that one of the scattering phases θj(λ, r) of
the scattering matrix

S(λ; Hr, H0),

considered as an analytic function of the coupling constant r, suﬀers a sudden jump by an integer
multiple of 2π when r crosses the real resonance point rλ. By a scattering phase θj(λ, r) we mean
this: eiθj(λ,r) is one of the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix S(λ; Hr, H0).

The limit values of resonance points rλ+i0 with non-zero imaginary parts have not been
investigated. In this paper for rank-one perturbations, in which case there is only one scattering
phase θ1(λ, r), we prove the following formula:

(1.1)

∂θ1 (λ, r)

∂r

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=Re rλ+i0

= −

Im rλ+i0

,

a.e. λ.

Since rλ+i0 is a pole of the scattering matrix, this formula is in agreement with Breit-Wigner
formula from quantum scattering theory, see e.g.
[T, Chapter 13], with
that diﬀerence that the phase is considered as a function of the coupling constant instead of
energy.

[Bo, Chapter XVIII],

2. Proof

Theorem 2.1. If V is a rank one self-adjoint operator and if H0 is a self-adjoint operator,
acting on a separable complex Hilbert space H, then for a.e. λ the formula (1.1) holds. In this
formula, for z outside the essential spectrum of H0, the number rz is a (unique) pole of the
meromorphic function

and rλ+i0 = limy→0+ rλ+iy, and eiθ1(λ,r) is the (unique) non-trivial eigenvalue of the scattering
matrix S(λ; Hr, H0).

Proof. Before proceeding to the proof we make some remarks. Since V has rank one, the default
premise of this theorem — the limiting absorption theorem — holds, see e.g.
[Y, Chapter 6];
this is necessary for existence of the scattering matrix and therefore for that of the scattering
phase. In the proof we use notation of the introduction of [Az2] and of [Az]. Objects such as ﬁber
Hilbert space hλ(H0), the wave matrices w±(λ; Hr, H0) and the scattering matrix S(λ; Hr, H0)
are deﬁned by explicit formulas of the constructive approach to stationary scattering theory,
given in [Az] and outlined in the introduction of [Az2]. Therefore, we can consider all these
objects as well deﬁned for all r except a discrete set, as long as λ belongs to a pre-deﬁned set
of full Lebesgue measure, which comes from the limiting absorption principle, for details see
introduction of [Az2]. Since V has rank one, it can be easily shown that the resonance point
rz is a well-deﬁned single-valued Herglotz function in the upper complex half-plane C+ (to be
precise, rz is a Herglotz function if V is non-negative, otherwise −rz is a Herglotz function).

In the following λ is a real number from a set Λ(H0, F ) of full Lebesgue measure (that
is, R \ Λ(H0, F ) is a set of measure zero). Here F is a rigging operator which is necessary
for constructive approach to stationary scattering theory, see [Az],
In
particular, the rigging operator F generates a rigging (H+, H, H−) of the Hilbert space H and it
allows to deﬁne the evaluation operator Eλ(Hr) : H+ → hλ(Hr) for all non-resonant values of the
coupling constant r. The diamond conjugate E♦
λ (Hr) of Eλ(Hr) is an operator from hλ(Hr) to H−
such that for any f ∈ H+ and any g ∈ hλ(Hr) one has hEλ(Hr)f, gihλ(Hr) = Df, E♦
λ (Hr)gEH+,H−
,
is the pairing of the rigging triple (H+, H, H−). Finally, the operator V can
where h·, ·iH+,H−
be treated as an operator from H− to H+. For details see [Az] and [Az2].

[Az2, Introduction].

Now we proceed to the proof. Since λ is ﬁxed, we write θj(r) for θj(λ, r). We have the formula

[Az, Theorem 7.3.3]

dS(λ; Hr, H0)

dr

= −2πiw+(λ; H0, Hr)Eλ(Hr)V E♦

λ (Hr)w+(λ; Hr, H0)S(λ; Hr, H0).

Since the operator S(λ; Hr, H0), acting on the ﬁber Hilbert space hλ = hλ(H0), is unitary, it
follows that

dS(λ; Hr, H0)

dr

S−1(λ; Hr, H0) = −2πiw+(λ; H0, Hr)Eλ(Hr)V E♦

λ (Hr)w+(λ; Hr, H0).

Further mostly we write S(r) for S(λ; Hr, H0). Since (see [Az2, Corollary 5.3.8])

taking traces of both sides of the previous equality gives

w+(λ; H0, Hr)w+(λ; Hr, H0) = 1hλ,

Tr(S′(r)S−1(r)) = −2πi Trhλ (cid:16)Eλ(Hr)V E♦

= −2πi TrH+ (cid:16)V E♦

λ (Hr)(cid:17)
λ (Hr)Eλ(Hr)(cid:17) .

The product E♦
[Az, (5.5)]). So,

λ (Hr)Eλ(Hr) is equal to 1

π Im Rλ+i0(Hr) (as an operator from H+ to H−, see

Tr(S′(r)S−1(r)) = −2i TrH+ (V Im Rλ+i0(Hr)) .

This we can rewrite as (see [Az, §2.15])

Tr(S′(r)S−1(r)) = −2i lim
y→0+

TrH (V Im Rλ+iy(Hr)) .

Hence,

Tr(S′(r)S−1(r)) = − lim
y→0+

TrH (V Rλ+iy(Hr) − V Rλ−iy(Hr)) .

Now we recall that a resonance point rz corresponding to a triple (z; H0, V ) is a complex number
such that (s − rz)−1 is an eigenvalue of the compact operator Rz(Hs)V (see [Az2, §3.1], more
speciﬁcally [Az2, (3.1.2)]). Since by the premise the operator V has rank 1, the operator
Rz(Hs)V has only one eigenvalue. Therefore, (using ¯rz = r¯z, which is obvious)

Tr(S′(r)S−1(r)) = − lim

y→0+ (cid:0)(r − rz)−1 − (r − ¯rz)−1(cid:1)

= − lim
y→0+

= − lim
y→0+

−¯rz + rz

(r − rz)(r − ¯rz)

2i Im rz

(r − rz)(r − ¯rz)

.

Taking the limit and replacing r by Re rλ+i0, we get

Tr(S′(r)S−1(r))(cid:12)(cid:12)r=Re rλ+i0

= −

2i Im rλ+i0

(Re rλ+i0 − rλ+i0)(Re rλ+i0 − ¯rλ+i0)
Im rλ+i0
|Im rλ+i0|2 .

= −2i

One the other hand, since rank(V ) = 1, the ﬁber Hilbert space hλ(H0) on which the scattering
matrix S(r) acts is one-dimensional. Hence, S(λ; Hr, H0) is the operator of multiplication by
its eigenvalue:

S(λ; Hr, H0) = eiθ1(r) · 1hλ(H0).

It follows that

Tr(S′(r)S−1(r))(cid:12)(cid:12)r=Re rλ+i0

=

deiθ1(r)

e−iθ1(r)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=Re rλ+i0

dr
1(Re rλ+i0).

= iθ′

Comparing the last two formulas completes the proof.
