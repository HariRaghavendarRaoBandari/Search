Recently, it has been suggested in [JHEP 12(2015)003] that the Brown-York mechanism can be
used to measure the quasilocal energy in Lovelock gravity. We have used this method in a system
of M0-branes and show that the Brown-York energy evolves in the process of birth and growth of
Lovelock gravity. This can help us to predict phenomenological events which are emerged as due
to dynamical structure of Lovelock gravity in our universe. In this model, ﬁrst, M0-branes join to
each other and form an M3-brane and an anti-M3-branes connected by an M2-brane. This system
is named BIon. Universes and anti-universes live on M3-branes and M2 plays the role of wormhole
between them. By passing time, M2 dissolves in M3’s and nonlinear massive gravities, like Lovelock
massive gravity, emerges and grows. By closing M3-branes, BIon evolves and wormhole between
branes makes a transition to black hole. During this stage, Brown-York energy increases and
shrinks to large values at the colliding points of branes. By approaching M3-branes towards each
other, the square energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are produced.
To remove these states, M3-branes compact, the sign of compacted gravity changes, anti-gravity
is created which leads to getting away of branes from each other. Also, the Lovelock gravity
disappears and it’s energy forms a new M2 between M3-branes. By getting away of branes from
each other, Brown-York energy decreases and shrinks to zero.

INTRODUCTION

Measuring the quasilocal energy in general relativity is an extremely important but a long eluding problem. There
is an ambiguity in calculating this energy as due to its nonlinear nature and the fact that gravitational energy is
non-localizable. The best method for measuring gravitational energy has been proposed by the Brown and York in

[1] by employing the Hamilton-Jacob theory for gravitation. This method has been studied extensively in general
relativity for static spacetime with spherical symmetry and also for Kerr black hole [2–5]. Recently, It has been
generalized the Brown-York formalism to all orders in Lovelock gravity and have been veriﬁed the conjunction for
pure Lovelock black hole [6]. Motivated by this research, we investigate the evolution of this energy during the birth
and growth of Lovelock gravity in a system of M0-branes. In our model, M0-branes join to each other and form
universe and anti-universe which are connected by a wormhole. This system is named BIon. By considering the
changes in Brown-York energy, we can predict the evolution of Lovelock gravity in a BIonic system. This can help us
predict phenomenological events which are emerged due to dynamical structure of Lovelock gravity in our universe.
In previous work, BIon model [7–12] has been used in cosmology to consider the evolution of universe from birth
and then inﬂation to late time acceleration. For example, in one paper, k black fundamental strings link to each other
and construct a BIon [7, 8]. Coincidence with the birth of BIon, a universe and an anti-universe are born which are
connected with each other through a wormhole [7, 8]. This wormhole dissolves in branes and causes their expansion.
In another work, ﬁrst, N fundamental strings transit to N pair of M0 and anti-M0-branes. Then, M0-branes glue to
each other and build a pair of an M5 and an anti-M5-brane. This pair decays to an M3-brane, an anti-M3-brane in
additional to one M2-brane. Our universe is formed on one of these M3-branes and M2 has the role of wormhole . In
this theory, there is not any big-bang and the origin of universe is a fundamental string [11]. In another scenario, ﬁrst
M0-branes are compacted on a circle and N D0-branes are created. Then, N D0-branes join to each other and build
one D5-branes. Next, D5- brane is compacted on two circles and a D3-brane, two D1-brane and some extra energies
are produced. Our universe is built on D3-brane and D1-branes dissolve in universe and lead to inﬂation and late
time acceleration [12].

Now, a natural question arises to how can we consider the evolution of BIon in four dimensional universe? We
answer it by measuring the Brown-York energy which changes by changing the Lovelock gravity in this system. In
our consideration, ﬁrst M0-branes join to each other and build an M3, an anti-M3 and an M2-brane which connects
them. Each of universes live on an M3-brane and M2 has the role of wormhole. By passing time, this M2 dissolves
into M3-branes, some nonlinear gravities like the F (R)-gravity and Love-lock gravity [13, 14] emerge and universe
expands. By closing branes towards each other, wormhole becomes more thermal and transits to black hole. During
this era, the Brown-York energy increases and shrinks to large values. By approaching branes to each other, the
square energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are produced. To remove these states, M3
compacts, the sign of compacted gravity changes and the anti-gravity emerges which leads to getting away of branes
from each other and contraction of universe. In this epoch, the Brown-York energy decreases and shrinks to zero.

The outline of the paper is the following. In section II, we consider the evolution of the Brown-York energy during
the expansion branch in BIonic system. In section III, we discuss as to how by compacting branes gravity changes to
anti- gravity and the particles get away from each other. This leads to a decrease of the Brown-York energy in BIonic
system. The last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions.

II. THE EVOLUTION OF THE BROWN-YORK ENERGY DURING THE EXPANSION BRANCH IN

BIONIC SYSTEM

In this section, we show that the relevant action of Mp-branes can be obtained by summing over the actions of

are placed on M3-branes and connect with each other via an M2-brane. M2 plays the role of wormhole, dissolves
in M3-branes and leads to the emergence of nonlinear gravity and a black hole. In the background of this gravity,
the Brown-York energy increases and tends to large values. It has been shown that the Brown-York energy can be
obtained from following equation [1]:

EBY =

1

8π Zβ

d2x√q(˜k − ˜k0)

(1)

where q is the metric deﬁned on the surface B which is the boundary of three space Σ and ˜k0 denotes the trace of
extrinsic curvature for some reference spacetime. We will use of this equation and consider the evolution of energy in
BIon. To begin considering the evolution of energy in BIon, we should ﬁrst consider the process of formation of BIon
in M-theory. To this end, we should construct the action of BIon from D1 and M1-branes and also show that these
branes are built of D0 and M0-brane. We introduce the Lagrangian for D1 as [11, 12, 15–20]:

S = −TD1Z d2σ ST r  − det(Pab[EmnEmi(Q−1 + δ)ij Ejn])det(Qi

Equation (8) shows that each Dp-brane can be built from joining p D0-branes. We can extend these results to M-
theory. By replacing two dimensional Nambu-Poisson bracket for Dp-branes by three one in action and using the
Li-3-algebra [21–24], we can obtain the relevant action for M0-brane [11, 12]:

This action shows that similar to string theory, each Mp-brane can be constructed from p M0-branes. When M0-
branes join to each other, two form gauge ﬁelds are born which play the role of tensor mode of graviton on the brane.
To show this, we use of the mechanism in ref [11] and obtain the following mappings [11, 12, 21–24]:

the world-volume indices of the M p-branes, i, j, k = p + 1, ..., 9 refer to indices of the transverse space, and m, n

formation an Mp-brane, two form gauge ﬁelds are produced that may have the role of tensor mode of graviton in real
world. Also, scalar ﬁelds may play the role of scalar mode of graviton. We can write:

(22)

Here π denotes the scalar mode and hab refers to the tensor mode of graviton. Until now, many papers have discussed
that there can be existed antisymmetric metric [25, 26]and antisymmetric gravity [27, 28]. On the other hand, when
we speak of BIon, our metric is consisted of metrics of two universe branes which are connected by a wormhole. One
can construct antisymmetric form of metric by combining these three metrics. Thus, we can put the antisymmetric
metric equal to two form gauge ﬁelds in M-theory. Obviously, non-commutative bracket for two form ﬁelds produces
the exact form of curvature tensor. Also, by linking scalars to branes, they play the role of scalar mode of graviton.
In previous considerations, it has been found that there is a relation between κ and curvature scalars (R) [15]:

δρσ
µν κµ

ρ κν

σ = R

(23)

Thus, curvature scalars and tensors in gravity can be obtained from the non-commutative brackets in M-theory. At
this stage, we can derive the form of ˜χ in equation (18) in terms of curvature scalars and tensors in gravity. We have:

det(Z) = δa1,a2...an

det(Z) = det(cid:0)Pabc[Emnl + Emij(Q−1 − δ)ijkEkln](cid:1) + λ2 det(F )

(24)

Using the above relation, we can calculate the relevant terms of determinant in action (18) separately. Applying

relations (21,22,23) in determinants (24), we obtain:

This equation shows that all terms in nonlinear gravity theories like Lovelock gravity[13] and F(R)-gravity [29] can
be extracted from actions in M-theory. Also, by increasing dimensions of Mp-brane, higher orders of gauge ﬁelds and
scalars are created which appear as higher orders of curvature tensors and scalars in the eﬀective potential between
branes and anti-branes. These nonlinear gravity terms cause production of absorption force between branes and
generation of conﬁnement.

Till now, we have shown that equation (16) for branes and equation (29) for Lovelock gravity are the same. Now,
we obtain the gravitational energy in this system. In our model, universes are placed on the M3-brane and interact
with anti-branes which live on anti-M3-branes via M2-branes. Also, in this model, gauge ﬁelds live on the brane and

scalars live in extra dimensions and by increasing the length of brane, gauge ﬁelds grow and scalars decrease. Using
the equation (13)and assuming the length of M2 between two M3 be l2 and the length of each M3 be l3, we can derive
the relevant action for the system of M3-M2:

where ts is time of collision between branes. These results show that by passing time, the length of M2 between
two M3-branes decreases and shrinks to zero, while the length of M3 increases to large values. This means that M2
dissolves in M3-branes and leads to their expansion. In our model, universes are placed on the M3-branes and connect
with each other via M2-branes. By passing time, M2 disappears and nonlinear gravity emerges which is the main
cause of conﬁnement between branes and anti-branes. In fact, M2 plays the role of wormhole as indicated in [1]. Now,
using equations (30 and 33), we obtain the eﬀective potential between branes and anti-branes:

where ci’s are some coeﬃcients which depend on the tension of branes and λ. This potential is very similar to
prediction of QCD for potential between quarks and anti-quarks [30]. This means that usual potential between branes

which is produced by dissolving M2-branes in M3-branes can be used in QCD. On the other hand, we have shown
that by closing branes and disappearing M2, Lovelock gravity emerges. Thus, the Lovelock gravity may be the main
cause of potential in brane systems. Now, we want to consider the evolution of gravitational energy in BIon. First,
we show that by closing branes to each other, BIon becomes thermal and transits to black hole. To this end, we begin
with equation of motion of ﬁelds between branes and use of the method in [7]:

Now, we can obtain the Brown-York energy during the expansion branch. To this end, we use of the method in [6].
The metric (40)is assumed to be asymptotically ﬂat, i.e., in the limit r, z → ∞ and l2 → ∞, parameters of BIon go
to unity ( D, H, f → ∞) giving the ﬂat Minkowskian metric. To match with the method in [6], we redeﬁne the line
elements in (40) as

where have used of this fact that BIon contains two branes which are connected by a black hole. We focus on the
line element of black hole (ds2
BH ). The hypersurface Σ is taken to be a t = constant hypersurface and B as a r =
constant surface. The two-surface B is a r = constant hypersurface within Σ. Then, the unit timelike normal ua to
Σ and unit spacelike normal na to B turn out to be

10

ua = −qD−1/2 ¯H−1/2f (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0); ua =qD1/2 ¯H−1/2f−1(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
ηa =qD−1/2 ¯H 1/2f−1(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);

ηa =qD1/2 ¯H−1/2f (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

Having derived the normal to Σ and B we can now obtain the corresponding extrinsic curvatures, and in particular

(48)

for the latter we get,

∂µ(√hηµ) = −∂rηr − ηr∂rln√h =
k = −

The embedding of B in a ﬂat spacetime is trivial and the trace of extrinsic curvature k0 is simply − 2

the curvature in Eq. (49)and the Brown-York energy deﬁned in Eq. (1), we obtain:

This equation shows that by passing time and decreasing the separation distance between two branes (l2), the Brown-
York energy increases and tends to inﬁnity at (t = ts) (See Figure 1(Left).). This is because that by approaching M3-
branes, M2 dissolves in them, nonlinear gravities like Lovelock gravity grow and temperature and also the gravitational
energy of system increase.

At this stage, we can generalized his energy to all orders of Lovelock gravity. Previously, it has been asserted that

the Brown-York energy for mth order Lovelock static black hole reads as [6]:

EBY = rD−2m−1[D0(1 −q ¯f )2m−1 + ... + Ds(1 −q ¯f )2m−2s−1(1 − ¯f )s + ...Dm−1(1 − ¯f )m−1(1 −q ¯f )] (52)

To use of the above equation, we redeﬁne parameters of BIon for mth order of Lovelock gravity:

(53)

For D=4 and m=1, this equation converts to equation (50). For higher orders of m, the Brown-York energy evolves
faster than lower orders (see Figure1(Right)). This is because that by increasing the number of dimensions, more
channels for ﬂowing energy into our universe creates which leads to emergence of higher order terms in gravity. In
these conditions, the eﬀect of Lovelock gravity on the system becomes more and consequently, the energy of system
increases. By considering the evolution of this energy, we can predict some phenomenological events that occur as
due to interaction of branes in our four dimensional universe.

FIG. 1:
(left) The Brown-York energy for expansion branch of universe with D=4 and m=1 as a function of the t where t is
the age of universe. In this plot, we choose ts = 33Gyr, TM 2 = 100. and ls = 0.1. (right) In the right panel by taking the same
values of the model parameters with m = 3.

III. THE EVOLUTION OF THE BROWN-YORK ENERGY DURING THE CONTRACTION BRANCH

IN BIONIC SYSTEM

By now, we have shown that by closing M3-branes to each other, M2 dissolves in them and nonlinear gravities like
Lovelock emerge. Now, we will show that by approaching branes to each other, the square energy of system become

negative and system transits to tachyonic phase. To remove this state, Mp-branes compact, the sign of gravity changes
and anti-gravity emerges which leads to getting away of branes from each other. In these conditions, temperature of
system decreases, black hole disappears and the Brown-York energy vanishes. Using equation (30) we have:

12

l2 → 0, l3 → ∞, l′2 → ∞, l′3 → ∞ ⇒

2 + l′2
l6
3 + l′2

3 < 0

(54)
This equation shows that by closing branes, the quantity under √ becomes negative and some tachyonic states are
appeared. To solve this problem, branes are compactiﬁed and Mp-branes transit to Dp-branes. To show this, we use
of the method in [24] and deﬁne < X 10 >=

This equation shows that by compactiﬁcation of branes, two form ﬁelds in eleven dimensional space-time converts
to one form ﬁeld and the sign of nonlinear terms in action change. Using equations (23) and (55), we can obtain the

This equation indicates that when Mp-branes are compactiﬁed, nonlinear gravity terms changes to other type of
non-linear gravity terms with opposite sign. This can be a signature of anti-gravity. As due to the emergence of
anti-gravity, M3-branes get away from each other and one M2-branes is produced between them.
In our model,
branes and anti-branes live on the M3-branes and thus, by closing towards each other, gravity changes to anti-gravity
and prevents from approaching and disappearing branes. Using the relations in equation (55), we can show that the
action (16) converts to following action:

As can be seen from above equation, by compactifying M-theory, Mp-branes transit to Dp-branes. Similar to
previous section, we assume that universes are placed on D3-branes which are connected by a D2-brane. To consider
the evolution of branes, we assume the length of D2 between two D3 is l2 and the length of each D3 be l3 and obtain
the relevant action for the system of D3-D2:

This equation shows that at t = ts, the separation distance (l2) between two branes is zero and the size of D3 branes
is inﬁnite, while by passing time, branes get away from each other, l2 → ∞ and l3 → 0. This means that branes and
anti-branes get away from each other and connect by a D2-brane. Similar to previous section, using equations (60
and 63), we derive the eﬀective potential between branes and anti-branes:

where bi’s are some coeﬃcients which depend on the tension of branes and λ. This equation shows that by
compacting branes, order of l−1
increases. This is because that near the colliding point l2 → 0, the repulsive potential
is very large and shrinks to zero at inﬁnity. Now, we obtain temperature of system by using the equations (43 and
64):

This equation shows that by passing time and increasing the separation distance between two branes (l2), the
Brown-York energy decreases and shrinks to zero at large values of time (See Figure 2(Left).). This is because that by
getting away of M3-branes, the nonlinear gravity like the Lovelock gravity disappears and temperature and also the
gravitational energy of system decreases. Using equation (68), we can obtain the Brown-York energy for mth order
of Lovelock gravity for a system with D=3m+1

EBY = rm[D0(

(68)

For m=1, above equation reduces to equation (67). This equation shows that by increasing number of dimensions
the eﬀect of Lovelock gravity increases and consequently, more changes can be observed in energy of system (See
Figure2(Right)). This is because that by increasing the number of dimensions, there exists many channels for ﬂowing
energy from extra dimensions and other universes to our own universe which leads to the emergence of higher order
terms in gravity.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this research, we have used the idea of [6] for measuring the gravitational energy in Lovelock gravity for considering
the evolution of BIonic system. In our model, ﬁrst M0-branes join each other and form a system of one M3, one
anti-M3 and an M2-brane. Brane lives on an M3, anti-brane is placed on an anti-M3 and M2 connects them. M2 plays
the role of wormhole between branes and is the main cause of gravitational energy in BIonic system. By dissolving
M2 in M3-branes, Lovelock gravity is produced and M3 expands. By closing branes to each other, wormhole becomes
thermal and transits to black hole. During this epoch, the Brown-York increases and shrinks to large values. By
approaching branes, the square energy of M2-M3 system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are created.
To remove these states, M2 and M3-branes compact, gravity converts to anti-gravity and branes get away from each
other. We have calculated the potential between branes and anti-branes and ﬁnd that it is in agreement with previous
predictions. This means that usual potential between branes may be produced by dissolving M2-branes in M3-branes
which branes live on it. On the other hand, by closing branes and disappearing M2, Lovelock gravity emerges. Thus,
the Lovelock gravity may be the main cause of the wormhole and gravitational energy between branes and anti-branes.
During this era, the Brown-York decreases and shrinks to zero.
