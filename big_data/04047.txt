Abstract

Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set. Given 2 ≤ m ≤ n, we construct a convex function
φ : Ω → R whose gradient f = ∇φ is a H¨older continuous homeomorphism, f is the
identity on ∂Ω, the derivative Df has rank m − 1 a.e. in Ω and Df is in the weak Lm
space Lm,w. The proof is based on convex integration and staircase laminates.

1 Introduction

Let n ∈ N and let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set. This paper deals with homeomorphisms
f : Ω → Rn in the Sobolev class whose derivative Df has rank less than m at a.e. point, for
a given m ≤ n.

In [20], Hencl proves that there exists a homeomorphism f in W 1,p ((0, 1)n, (0, 1)n), 1 ≤
p < n, such that its Jacobian determinant Jf equals zero a.e. Notice that condition p < n
is necessary, since if f ∈ W 1,n and Jf ≥ 0, then f satisﬁes the Luzin (N) condition and,
consequently, the area formula holds. Therefore, any f ∈ W 1,n with Jf = 0 a.e. satisﬁes

|f (Ω)| ≤ZΩ

Jf = 0,

and, hence, f cannot be a homeomorphism. In fact, in [21] it is proved that if a Sobolev map
f is such that

(1)

lim

ε→0ZΩ

|Df |n−ε = 0,

then f satisﬁes condition (N), whereas the construction of [6] elaborates on that of [20] to
show that there exists a homeomorphism f ∈ W 1,1 ((0, 1)n, Rn) such that Jf = 0 almost
everywhere and Df is in the grand Lebesgue space Ln), i.e.,

|Df |n−ε < ∞.

Obviously, such f cannot satisfy (1).

The construction of Hencl [20] has been further developed in [13, 7] to construct bi-
Sobolev homeomorphisms f with Jf = 0 almost everywhere and with zero minors of Df
almost everywhere.

All those constructions were based on a careful explicit construction and a limit process

to obtain a Cantor set where the Jacobian is supported.

In this work we explore a diﬀerent way of obtaining such kind of pathological maps by
using the staircase laminates invented by Faraco [15], in combination with the version of
convex integration used by M¨uller and ˇSver´ak [28]. In fact, such laminates have turned out to
be useful in a number of apparently unrelated problems such as Lp theory of elliptic equations
[2], Burkholder functions [4], Hessians of rank-one convex functions [9], microstructure and
phase transitions in solids [29, 27] and counterexamples of L1 estimates [8]. As in the case
of Ornstein inequalities [8], laminates allow one to decouple the construction of pathological
maps occurring in various situations into an analytical part and a geometrical part. The
analytical part is taken care by the general theory of laminates and the version of convex
integration based on in-approximations (in fact, in the problem at hand, on a slight evolution
of the version for unbounded sets developed in [2] which guarantees that the limit map is a
homeomorphism). The geometrical part, which is the key in the whole process, consists in
ﬁnding a suitable staircase laminate. In fact, in [16] it was sketched how to use laminates
to obtain, in dimension 2, a convex function whose gradient f is in W 1,p for all p < 2, and
satisﬁes Jf = 0 a.e., recovering another interesting example of Alberti and Ambrosio [1].

We mention that gradients of convex functions are interesting in its own right; for ex-
ample, they are the key ingredient in the polar decomposition of the Brenier map in mass
transportation [5]. In this regard, our example show some limits of the regularity for transport
maps [11].

In the current work we show that with staircase laminates it is possible to combine the
results of [16, 1, 20]. In fact, we also recover the result of ˇCern´y [7], where he constructs a
homeomorphism f with all its minors of m-th order equal to zero almost everywhere belonging
to W 1,p with 1 ≤ p < n

n+1−m .

To be precise, we build a probability measure formed by staircase laminates in the planes
parallel to the axes, which can be pushed to show that not only the Jacobian is zero but also
that Df has all its minors of order m equal to zero almost everywhere and Df is in Lm,w,
i.e., there exists a constant C > 0 such that

|{x ∈ Ω : |Df (x)| > t}| ≤ Ct−m,

t > 0.

In the particular case when m = n we have Ln,w ⊂ Ln), so our result is sharp in the sense
explained before. In fact, it seems likely that we could push our construction so that Df (x)
is diagonal for all x except in a set of arbitrarily small measure, but we do not pursue this
issue here.

This is the theorem that we will prove.

Theorem 1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set, m ∈ N, 2 ≤ m ≤ n, δ > 0 and α ∈ (0, 1).
Then there exists a convex function u : Ω → R such that its gradient f = ∇u satisﬁes:

2

i) f ∈ W 1,1(Ω, Rn) and f : Ω → Ω is a homeomorphism.

ii) f = id on ∂Ω.

iii) rank(Df (x)) < m for a.e. x ∈ Ω.

iv) Df ∈ Lm,w (Ω, Rn×n).

v) kf − id kC α(Ω) < δ and kf −1 − id kC α(Ω) < δ.

Our theorem shows that a H¨older continuous Brenier map (the gradient of a convex

function; see, e.g., [30, p. 67] for the deﬁnition) may have a rather pathological behaviour.

As discussed at the beginning, the result is known to be sharp in the sense of integrability
in the case m = n. Notice that in this case, as explained in [20], using the area formula for
Sobolev mappings ([19]) we have that this kind of homeomorphisms sends a set of full measure
to a null set, and a null set to a set of full measure, i.e., there exists Z ⊂ Ω of measure zero
such that

|f (Ω \ Z) | =Zf (Ω\Z)

dy =ZΩ\Z

Jf (x) dx = 0

and

|f (Z) | = |f (Ω) | − |f (Ω \ Z) | = |f (Ω) |.

The structure of the paper is as follows.
In Section 2 we introduce the concept of laminate of ﬁnite order and sketch the construction
of the laminate that will be central in the proof of Theorem 1. Notice that if m 6= n 6= 2 the
construction is genuinely diﬀerent from previous staircase laminates as we need to lower the
rank accordingly.

Section 3 presents the general notation of the paper.
In Section 4 we prove that, given a laminate of ﬁnite order, there exists a function f whose
derivative is close to the laminate. Moreover, if the laminate is supported in the set of positive
deﬁnite matrices then f is a homeomorphism.

Section 5 shows that if we modify a H¨older homeomorphism by cutting and pasting, the

map obtained is still a H¨older homeomorphism .

Section 6, which is the bulk of the paper, constructs a sequence of laminates that converges
to the probability measure sketched in Section 2, as well as a sequence of functions that
approximate the laminates.

In Section 7 we prove Theorem 1.
In Section 8 we show the sharpness of our result by proving that there does not exist a
H¨older continuous homeomorphism in W 1,m(Ω, Rn) such that f = id on ∂Ω and rank(Df ) <
m a.e. in Ω. Moreover, H¨older continuity can be dispensed with if f ∈ W 1,p(Ω, Rn) for somw
p > m.

Note: When our paper was presented, S. Hencl called our attention to a recent preprint
by Liu and Mal´y [25], where a result very similar to our Theorem 1 was proved, with a
construction related to laminates but not inspired in [16]. It would be very interesting to see
how much these examples have in common. For instance, an understanding of the support of

3

the distributional Jacobian or, in general, the distributional minors is pending. The advantage
of the method presented in this paper is that, once an extremal staircase laminate is found,
which is a relatively fast task (Section 2), the extremal mapping quite likely will appear, for
example by the in-approximation method. Notice that this last step is not always possible,
as shown by the case of monotone maps (the staircase laminate from [8] is supported in the
range of gradients of planar monotone maps, which are regular by [1]). Finally, we mention
that it will also be worthy to see the relation with the works [22, 23], where the results of [8]
are easily recovered from the study of rank-one convex functions that are one-homogeneous.

2 Sketch of the proof

The next deﬁnition introduces the concept of laminate of ﬁnite order [10, 29, 28, 2].

Deﬁnition 2. The family L(Rn×n) of laminates of ﬁnite order is the smallest family of
probability measures in Rn×n with the properties:

• L(Rn×n) contains all the Dirac masses.

i=1 λiδAi ∈ L(Rn×n) and AN = λB+(1−λ)C, where λ ∈ [0, 1] and rank (B−C) = 1,

• IfPN

then the probability measure

N −1

Xi=1

λiδAi + λN (λδB + (1 − λ)δC )

is also in L(Rn×n).

Note that any laminate of ﬁnite order is a convex combination of Dirac masses. Since
in this work we will only use laminates of ﬁnite order, for simplicity they will be just called
laminates.

In this section we construct the sequence of laminates νk of ﬁnite order that is behind
the whole article. The actual proof will consist in approximating νk with laminates of ﬁnite
order supported in the set of positive deﬁnite matrices, then use Proposition 3 to obtain
homeomorphisms that are close to the approximate laminates in small regions of the domain,
then paste the obtained homeomorphisms to construct a homeomorphism in the whole domain
and, ﬁnally, a limit passage will yield the homeomorphism f of Theorem 1. The fact that f
is the gradient of a convex function is standard since Df was constructed to be symmetric
positive semideﬁnite.

Although this section is not necessary for the proof of Theorem 1, it will help the reader

to follow the construction of Section 6.

In order to construct νk, we need to deﬁne the sets

i = {A = k diag(v) : v ∈ {0, 1}n and rank (A) = n − i} ,
Sk

k ∈ N,

i ∈ {0, . . . , n − m}

and

E = {A ∈ Rn×n : rank(A) < m}.

Thus, the matrices of Sk
subspaces parallel to the axes.

i are k times the identity matrix in the (n − i)-dimensional linear

The main property of the laminates to be constructed is as follows: for each k ∈ N, νk is

supported in Sn−m

i=0 Sk

i ∪ E,

and

for some C > 0.

|A| ≤ k for all A ∈ supp (νk) ,

νk(cid:16)Sk

i(cid:17) ≤ Cki−n,

The weak∗ limit ν of νk is supported in the set E. It satisﬁes that there exists a constant

C > 0 such that

(2)

ν ({|A| > t}) ≤ Ct−m,

t > 0.

This last inequality will give us the desired integrability of the derivative of the homeomor-
phism.

The laminates νk are deﬁned inductively as follows. We start with ν1 = δI . Now, given

νk−1 =

If A ∈ E we deﬁne νA = δA, whereas if A ∈ Sk−1

for some

i ∈ {0, . . . , n − m}, we construct νA inductively. Without loss of generality,

and for each Bℓ,j ′ /∈ E with j′ 6= j, we have Bℓ,j ′ 6= Bℓ,j.

With the above induction hypotheses, we construct {Bℓ+1,j}2ℓ+1−1

(6) holds for ℓ + 1. Analogously, equalities (5) are easily seen to hold for ℓ + 1 as well.

Now, let 0 ≤ j ≤ 2ℓ+1 − 1. We have

Therefore, equality (7) holds for ℓ + 1.

Now ﬁx ℓ, j such that Bℓ+1,j /∈ E. Then Bℓ,⌊ j

whereas (9) yields

given Aj appearing in (3), we have constructed νAj as in (12) if Aj /∈ E and νAj = δAj if

We proceed by induction. The inequality for k = 1 is immediate since ν1 = δI . Let k ≥ 2
and suppose that for i = 0, . . . , n − m, inequality (18) holds for k − 1. Since the Aj of (3) are
diﬀerent, we have that νk−1(Aj) = λj. Now, for all ℓ ∈ {0, . . . , n − m}, we use (13) and (15)

(20)

νk(cid:0){A ∈ Rn×n : |A| > t}(cid:1) ≤ ˜Ct−m,

t > 0.

For simplicity of notation, the set {A ∈ Rn×n : |A| > t} will be abbreviated as {|A| > t}.
When k = 1, we have ν1 = δI , hence, (20) is obvious. Now, we divide the inductive step in
three cases, according to the values of t.

If t ≥ k + 1, we use (16) to obtain that νk+1 ({|A| > t}) = 0.
In the case t < k, we ﬁrst show that if |A| > t, Aj ∈ supp(νk) and νAj (A) > 0, then
Indeed, if Aj ∈ E, then νAj = δAj , so, as νAj (A) > 0, we have A = Aj, and
i , then |Aj| = k > t. Therefore, if |Aj| ≤ t, then

i=0 Sk

|Aj| > t.

νAj ({|A| > t}) = 0, and, hence,

therefore |Aj| > t; whereas if Aj ∈Sn−m
νk+1 ({|A| > t}) = Xj:Aj∈supp(νk)

|Aj|>t

νk(Aj)νAj ({|A| > t})

≤ νk ({Aj ∈ supp(νk) : |Aj| > t}) ≤ νk ({|A| > t}) ≤ ˜Ct−m.

Finally, in the case k ≤ t < k + 1, we use that if A ∈ supp(νk+1) and |A| > t, then, by
(16), we have that for all Aj ∈ supp(νk) ∩ E, equalities νAj (A) = δAj (A) = 0 are satisﬁed.
Hence, thanks to (19),

νk+1 ({|A| > t}) = Xj:Aj∈supp(νk)

Aj /∈E

νk(Aj)νAj ({|A| > t}) ≤ νk n−m
[i=0

i! ≤ Ck−m ≤ ˜Ct−m.

This ﬁnishes the proof of (20).

Let ν be the weak∗ limit of νk as k → ∞. Thanks to (19), ν is supported in E and, by

(20), inequality (2) holds.

We will try to illustrate this construction with some pictures.
In the simplest case n = m = 2, E is the set of matrices with zero determinant, ν1 = δI
and the ﬁrst steps of the construction are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. In the ﬁrst step (Figure
1) we split B0,0 = I into B1,0 = diag(0, 1) and B1,1 = diag (2, 1). As B1,0 ∈ E, the second
step (Figure 2) consists in splitting B1,1 into B2,2 = diag (2, 0) and B2,3 = diag (2, 2). After
the second split, we obtain

In the case n = 3, m = 2, E is the set of matrices of rank less than 2. In order to exemplify
the passage from step k − 1 to step k, if we start with a matrix in Sk−1
, the construction is

the same as in the case n = m = 2, whereas if we start with A ∈ Sk−1

3 General notation

We explain the general notation used throughout the paper, most of which is standard.

In the whole paper, Ω is an open, non-empty bounded set of Rn.
We denote by Rn×n the set of n × n matrices, by Γ+ its subset of symmetric positive

semideﬁnite matrices, and by SO(n) ⊂ Rn×n the orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.

is the Dirac delta at Ai. The barycenter of the

Given Ai ∈ Rn×n, the measure δAi

probability measure ν =PN

i=1 αiδAi is ν =PN

i=1 αiAi.

Given A ∈ Rn×n, let σ1(A) ≤ · · · ≤ σn(A) denote its singular values. If the matrix A is
clear from the context, we will just indicate their singular values as σ1, . . . , σn. In fact, in this
paper we will always deal with A ∈ Γ+, so its eigenvalues coincide with its singular values.
Its components are written Aα,β for α, β ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Its operator norm is denoted by |A|,
which coincides with σn(A). The norm of a v ∈ Rn is also denoted by |v|.

Given a1, . . . , an ∈ R the matrix diag(a1, . . . , an) ∈ Rn×n is the diagonal matrix with

diagonal entries a1, . . . , an.

We will use the symbol . when there exists a constant depending only on n and m such

that the left hand side is less than or equal to the constant times the right hand side.

Given a set E ⊂ Rn, we denote its characteristic function by χE. We write #E for the

number of elements of E. Its Lebesgue measure is denoted by |E|.

Given a ∈ R, its integer part is denoted by ⌊a⌋.
Given E ⊂ Rn, α ∈ (0, 1] and a function f : E → Rn, we denote the H¨older seminorm,

We will write f ∈ C α(E, Rn) when kf kC α(E) < ∞. Note that, if f is continuous, the above
norms and seminorms in E coincide with those in E. In particular, we will identify C α(E, Rn)
with C α(E, Rn), the set of H¨older functions of exponent α. Of course, if α = 1, they are
Lipschitz. A homeomorphism f is bi-H¨older if both f and f −1 are H¨older.

The identity function is denoted by id.
We will say that a continuous mapping f : Ω → Rn is piecewise aﬃne if there exists a
countable family {Ωi}i∈N of pairwise disjoint open subsets of Ω such that f |Ωi is aﬃne for all
i ∈ N, and

4 Approximation of laminates by functions

The following result, based on Astala, Faraco and Sz´ekelyhidi [2, Prop. 2.3], shows how the
gradient of a function can approximate a laminate. Given A1, A2 ∈ Γ+ we write A1 ≥ A2
when A1 − A2 ∈ Γ+. Note that, when A ∈ Rn×n, the same symbol A is used to indicate a
matrix (as in (e) below) and a linear function (as in (c)).

Proposition 3. Let N ∈ N, A1, . . . , AN ∈ Γ+ and L ≥ 1 be such that

Ai ≥ L−1I,

|Ai| ≤ L,

i = 1, . . . , N.

Consider α1, . . . , αN ≥ 0 such that ν := PN

for every α ∈ (0, 1), 0 < δ < 1
Ω ⊂ Rn, there exists a piecewise aﬃne bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism f : Ω → AΩ such that

i=1 αiδAi is in L(Rn×n) and call A := ν. Then,
2 min{L−1, min1≤i<j≤N |Ai − Aj|} and every bounded open set

(a) f = ∇u for some u ∈ W 2,∞(Ω),

(b) f (x) = Ax for x ∈ ∂Ω,

(c) kf − AkC α(Ω) < δ,

(d) kf −1 − A−1kC α(AΩ) < δ,

(e) |{x ∈ Ω : |Df (x) − Ai| < δ}| = αi|Ω| for all i = 1, . . . , N.

Proof. Parts (a), (b), (c) and (e) are proved in [2, Prop. 2.3]. To prove (d) we ﬁrst show that
f is bi-Lipschitz. We extend f to an open ball Ω′ such that Ω ⊂ Ω′ and f (x) = Ax in Ω′\Ω.
Thus, f is continuous in Ω′. We deﬁne, for each ε > 0,

Ω′

ε = {x ∈ Ω′ : dist(x, ∂Ω′) > ε}.

By (e) we get that Df (x) ≥ 1
2L-Lipschitz. Let {ηε}0<ε≤1 be a standard family of molliﬁers, and fε := ηε ∗ f ∈ C ∞(Ω′

2L I, and |Df (x)| ≤ 2L a.e. in Ω′. As Ω′ is convex then f is
ε) the

13

molliﬁcation of f . Using that the matrices M ∈ Rn×n
set, we ﬁnd that there exists an ε0 > 0 such that if ε ≤ ε0 then Dfε(x) ≥ 1

sym satisfying (2L)−1I ≤ M form a convex

ε ⊃ Ω.

2L I in Ω′

For each x, y ∈ Ω′

ε, calling h = y − x, we have that

|fε(y) − fε(x)||h| ≥ |hfε(y) − fε(x), hi| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Using that fε → f uniformly in Ω as ε → 0, we get

1
2L

|x − y| ≤ |f (y) − f (x)|.

Hence f is K-bi-Lipschitz in Ω with K = 2L. Therefore, f is a homeomorphism onto its
image. The equalities f (Ω) = AΩ and f (Ω) = AΩ follows from standard results using the
topological degree (e.g., [3, Thms. 1 and 2]).

Now we will estimate the C α seminorm of f −1 − A−1. For each y1, y2 ∈ f (Ω), let xi =

f −1(yi), i = 1, 2. Using that f is K-bilipschitz and that A ≥ L−1I, we get

|f −1(y1) − A−1y1 − f −1(y2) + A−1y2|

|y1 − y2|α

≤ K α|A−1|

|Ax1 − f (x1) − Ax2 + f (x2)|

|x1 − x2|α

≤ K α|A−1| |f − A|C α(Ω) ≤ K αLδ = 2Lα+1δ,

so

Therefore, |f −1 − A−1|C α(AΩ) can be done as small as we wish. Finally,

|f −1 − A−1|C α(AΩ) ≤ 2δLα+1.

kf −1 − A−1kL∞(AΩ) ≤ |f −1 − A−1|C α(AΩ)(diam AΩ)α,

so kf −1 − A−1kC α(AΩ) is as small as we wish.

5 Cutting and pasting H¨older homeomorphisms

In this section we prove that if we modify a bi-H¨older homeomorphism in some sets by
cutting and pasting other bi-H¨older homeomorphisms, the modiﬁed map is still a bi-H¨older
homeomorphism.

First we show how to bound the C α norm of a function in Ω with its C α norms in a

collection of subsets of Ω that covers Ω up to measure zero.

14

Lemma 4. Let α ∈ (0, 1], {Ωi}∞

and f : Ω → Rn such that f (x) = 0 for all x ∈S∞

kf kC α(Ω) ≤ 2 sup
i∈N

kf kC α(Ωi).

i=1 ⊂ Ω pairwise disjoint open sets such that |Ω \S∞

i=1 ∂Ωi. Then

i=1 Ωi| = 0,

Proof. We assume that the right hand side of the last inequality is ﬁnite. Given x, y ∈S∞

let i0, i1 ∈ N be such that x ∈ Ωi0 and y ∈ Ωi1.

If i0 = i1, then |f (x)−f (y)| ≤ |f |C α(Ωi0 ) |x−y|α. Whereas if i0 6= i1, we have Ωi0 ∩Ωi1 = ∅.

i=1 Ωi,

Consider

λ0 := min{λ ∈ [0, 1] : x + λ(y − x) ∈ ∂Ωi0},

λ1 := max{λ ∈ [0, 1] : x + λ(y − x) ∈ ∂Ωi1}

and denote x′ = x + λ0(y − x) and y′ = x + λ1(y − x). Then, f (x′) = f (y′) = 0, and, therefore,

|f (x) − f (y)| ≤ |f (x) − f (x′)| + |f (y′) − f (y)| ≤ |f |C α(Ωi0 ) |x − x′|α + |f |C α(Ωi1 ) |y′ − y|α

≤(cid:16)|f |C α(Ωi0 ) + |f |C α(Ωi1 )(cid:17) |x − y|α.

On the other hand, kf kL∞(S∞

i=1 Ωi) = supi∈N kf kL∞(Ωi). Hence,

kf kC α(S∞

i=1 Ωi) ≤ 2 sup
i∈N

kf kC α(Ωi).

As S∞

i=1 Ωi is dense in Ω, the required bound holds due to the uniform continuity.

The main result of this section is the following.

Lemma 5. Let f : Ω → Rn be a homeomorphism such that f and f −1 are C α for some
α ∈ (0, 1]. Let {ωi}i∈N ⊂ Ω be a family of pairwise disjoint open sets, and for each i ∈ N let
gi : ωi → f (ωi) be a homeomorphism such that gi = f on ∂ωi,

kf − gikC α(ωi) < ∞ and

sup
i∈N

kf −1 − g−1

i kC α(f (ωi)) < ∞.

sup
i∈N

Then, the function

˜f (x) :=(f (x)

gi(x)

if x ∈ Ω \Si∈N ωi,

if x ∈ ωi for some i ∈ N

is a homeomorphism between Ω and f (Ω) such that ˜f and ˜f −1 are C α and

kf − ˜f kC α(Ω) ≤ 2 sup

i∈N

kf − gikC α(ωi),

kf −1 − ˜f −1kC α(Ω) ≤ 2 sup

i∈N

kf −1 − g−1

i kC α(f (ωi)).

Proof. Using that f and gi are homeomorphisms we have that f (ωi) = gi(ωi), for each i ∈ N.
Thus, it is clear that the function

f (Ω) ∋ y 7−→(f −1(y)

g−1
i

(y)

if y ∈ f(cid:0)Ω \Si∈N ωi(cid:1) ,

if y ∈ f (ωi) for some i ∈ N

15

is the inverse of ˜f .

Using Lemma 4, we obtain that

k ˜f − f kC α(Si∈N ωi) ≤ 2 sup
k ˜f −1 − f −1kC α(f (Si∈N ωi)) ≤ 2 sup

i∈N

i∈N

kf − gikC α(ωi),

kf −1 − g−1

i kC α(f (ωi)).

Moreover, when we call F := ˜f − f , we have that F = 0 in Ω \Si∈N ωi. In order to show
that F is C α in Ω, given x1 ∈ Ω \Si∈N ωi and x2 ∈Si∈N ωi, we take x3 = x1 + λ(x2 − x1) for
some λ ∈ [0, 1] such that x3 ∈ ∂Si∈N ωi. Then F (x1) = F (x3) = 0 and, hence,
|F (x2) − F (x1)| = |F (x3) − F (x1)| ≤ kF kC α(Si∈N ωi) |x3 − x1|α ≤ kF kC α(Si∈N ωi) |x2 − x1|α .

This shows that F ∈ C α(Ω, Rn). Analogously, ˜f −1 − f −1 is C α in f (Ω) and the last bound of
the statement also holds. In particular, ˜f and ˜f −1 are C α, and, hence, ˜f is a homeomorphism
between Ω and f (Ω).

6 Construction of the laminate and its approximation

This section constructs the sequence of laminates together with their approximations by func-
tions. We will continuously use the following sets and constants.

For j ∈ N, we deﬁne the sequence of open sets Ej by

Ej = {A ∈ Γ+ : |A| >

1
2

+2−j, 2−j−m < σi(A) max{|A|m−1, 1} < 2−j

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−m+1}.

For a ∈ N, 0 ≤ a ≤ n − m, j ∈ N and R > 1

2 + 2−j such that

ρj,R :=

3 · 2−j−2

max{Rm−1, 1}

< R,

we deﬁne the closed sets

Ea

j,R = {A ∈ Γ+ : |A| >

We also denote

The sets Ej approximate the set of positive semideﬁnite matrices with rank less than m, and
the sets Ea

j,R approximate the set

| {z }

The number R plays the role of k in Section 2 and eventually will tend to inﬁnity. The number
ρj,R will tend to zero: the reason that it appears in the deﬁnition of Ea
j,R is that, even though
Ea

j,R approximates a subset of matrices of rank n − a, we need them to be invertible.

Given j ∈ N and R > 1

.

We have chosen rj,R small enough, depending on R (and, hence, on ρj,R) to perform all the
computations in this section: it will play the role of the δ of Proposition 3.

The next lemma constructs a laminate with the required integrability. The second part of

its proof follows that of Section 2.

Lemma 6. Let j ∈ N, a0 ∈ {0, . . . , n − m}, R > 0 with ρj,R < R and A ∈ Γ+ be such that
dist(A, Ea0

j,R) < rj,R. Then there exists ν ∈ L(Rn×n) such that ν = A,

j,R+1 ∪ Ej! ∩ {ξ ∈ Rn×n : |ξ| ≤ R + 1}

Ea

supp ν ⊂ n−m
[a=0
ν(cid:0)Ea

j,R+1(cid:1) ≤ C(j, R, a0, a).

and for 0 ≤ a ≤ n − m,

Proof. There exist Q ∈ SO(n) and B ∈ Ea0
0 < σ1 ≤ · · · ≤ σn and |A − B| < rj,R. Using the inequality

j,R such that A = Q diag (σ1, . . . , σn) QT , with

(23)

|σi(A) − σi(B)| ≤ |A − B|,

i = 1, . . . , n,

(see, e.g., [18, Cor. 4.5]), we ﬁnd that

(24)

|σi − ρj,R| < rj,R for 1 ≤ i ≤ a0,

and |σi − R| < rj,R for a0 + 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

In order to construct the desired laminate we prove that:

1) σn < R + 1.

17

2) ρj,R+1 < σ1.

3) 2−j−m < ρj,R+1 max(cid:8)1, σm−1

n

(cid:9) < 2−j.

Inequality 1) is obvious thanks to (24) since rj,R < 1. By (24), the deﬁnition of ρj,R+1 and
(21) we obtain

ρj,R+1 =

3 · 2−j−2
(R + 1)m−1 =

ρj,R max{1, Rm−1}

(R + 1)m−1

< ρj,R − rj,R < σ1,

where in the last inequality we have diﬀerentiated the cases a0 = 0 and a0 > 0. So we have
2). Lastly, we prove 3). On the one hand,

ρj,R+1 max(cid:8)1, σm−1

and, on the other hand,

n

(cid:9) ≤ ρj,R+1 max(cid:8)1, (R + rj,R)m−1(cid:9) ≤ ρj,R+1(R+1)m−1 = 3·2−j−2 < 2−j
3 · 2−j−2 max(cid:8)1, (R − rj,R)m−1(cid:9)

(cid:9) ≥ ρj,R+1 max(cid:8)1, (R − rj,R)m−1(cid:9) =

(R + 1)m−1

.

ρj,R+1 max(cid:8)1, σm−1

n

Therefore, if R ≤ 1 we have

3 · 2−j−2 max(cid:8)1, (R − rj,R)m−1(cid:9)

(R + 1)m−1

≥ 3 · 2−j−m−1 > 2−j−m,

whereas if R > 1 we use (21) to obtain

3·2−j−2 max(cid:8)1, (R − rj,R)m−1(cid:9)

(R + 1)m−1

Thus, 3) is proved.

≥ 3·2−j−2 (R − rj,R)m−1

(R + 1)m−1 ≥ 3·2−j−m−1(1−rj,R)m−1 > 2−j−m.

Now we build the laminate, following the lines of Section 2. We shall construct families

(25)

{Bℓ,i} ℓ=0,...,n
i=0,...2ℓ−1

⊂ Γ+ and {λℓ,i} ℓ=0,...,n

assume {Bℓ,i}2ℓ−1

Therefore, property (27) holds for ℓ+1. Now ﬁx ℓ, i such that Bℓ+1,i /∈ Ej. Then Bℓ+1,⌊ i
property (28) holds for ℓ + 1, and

Using (29) we ﬁnd that βℓ+1,i + γℓ+1,i ≤ n − m + 1. On the other hand, we have shown that

σα(Bℓ+1,i) ∈ {ρj,R+1, R + 1, σℓ+2, . . . , σn},

α = 1, . . . , n.

Thus, if we had βℓ+1,i + γℓ+1,i = n − m + 1 then, by 1) and 2) we would get

σα(Bℓ+1,i) = ρj,R+1,

α = 1, . . . , n − m + 1.

and by 3), Bℓ+1,i ∈ Ej, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (29) holds for ℓ + 1.
2 ⌋ 6= Bℓ,⌊ i

Now let i′ 6= i be such that Bℓ+1,i′ /∈ Ej. If ⌊ i

2 ⌋ 6= ⌊ i′

6= Bℓ+1,i, whereas if ⌊ i

2 ⌋ = ⌊ i′

Bℓ+1,i′
Bℓ+1,i′ 6= Bℓ+1,i.

Now we bound λℓ+1,i. Recall the notation (30) and the induction hypothesis (31). If i is

even and ℓ < a0, we have max{0, ℓ + 1 − a0 − γℓ,i} = 0 and, therefore,

The following result constructs a function whose gradient approximates the laminate of

the previous lemma and have the desired integrability.

Lemma 7. Let α ∈ (0, 1) and δ > 0. Then is a j1 ∈ N such that for any j ≥ j1, any

Fix k ∈ N and assume fk has been constructed. We obtain fk+1 by modifying fk on the

In property (j) we have used that Ej is open. We deﬁne the piecewise aﬃne function

which is a homeomorphism due to Lemma 5. Property (a) holds for k + 1 since fk+1 = fk on
∂ω. Property (b) holds for k + 1 thanks to (i) and Lemma 5. Property (f) for k + 1 follows
easily from the construction. Property (d) for k + 1 follows from (h) and (f). Property (c)
for k + 1 follows from (j) and (f). Finally, we have to prove (e) for k + 1.

the limit of fk. Thanks to the uniform convergence, the limit of f −1
is the inverse of f .
Thus, f is a homeomorphism.
In addition, f is piecewise aﬃne. To check this, we see
from (f) that fk+1 = fkχω\ωk + gkχωk for a certain gk : ωk → Rn piecewise aﬃne. Thus,

Finally, we estimate the integrability of Df . Given t > 0, let k1 = max{1, ⌊t − R⌋}. By

(d) and (f), we obtain that for all k ≥ k1,

Next, we construct a laminate that goes from Ej to Ej+m. Again, its proof follows the

Since ρj+m,σn = 3·2−j−2−m
max{1,σm−1

families (25) by ﬁnite induction on ℓ. Let B0,0 = A, λ0,0 = 1 and for 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ n − 1,

Using that 2−j−2m < ρj+m,σnσn < 2−j−m and the deﬁnition of Ej, we have that Bℓ,0 ∈ Ej+m

and the proof is ﬁnished.

A variant of Lemma 8 will be needed. If, instead of starting from an A ∈ Ej, we begin with
the identity matrix, the same proof of Lemma 8 yields the following result, which will be used
in the ﬁrst step of the construction of the sequence approximating the ﬁnal homeomorphism
of Theorem 1.

Lemma 9. Given α ∈ (0, 1) and δ > 0, let j1 ∈ N be as in Lemma 7. Then there exist
N ∈ N ∩ [2, 2n],

P1 ∈ Ej1;

Pi ∈ Ej1 ∪

|I| . |Pi| . |I|,

1 ≤ i ≤ N.

Next, we approximate the laminate of Lemma 8 by a function.

Lemma 10. Let A ∈ Ej. For any bounded open ω ⊂ Rn, α ∈ (0, 1) and η > 0 there exists a
piecewise aﬃne homeomorphism h ∈ W 1,1(ω, Rn) ∩ C α(ω) satisfying

(a) h(x) = Ax on ∂ω.

(b) kh − AkC α(ω) < η and kh−1 − A−1kC α(Aω) < η.

(c) Dh(x) ∈ Ej+m a.e. x ∈ ω.

(d) Rω |Dh(x) − A|dx . 2−j|ω|.

(e) There exists an open set ˜ω ⊂ ω such that

(e1) |Dh(x) − A| . 2−j a.e. x ∈ ω \ ˜ω.
(e2) |{x ∈ ˜ω : |Dh(x)| > t}| . 2−j|ω|t−m.

Proof. First we build the laminate of Lemma 8:

νA =

λiδPi ∈ L(Rn×n)

satisfying νA = A, (42) and (43). Let ε > 0 be such that

for R ∈ (|A| − ε, |A| + ε).

Then, Proposition 3 gives a piecewise aﬃne homeomorphism g : ω → Aω satisfying

1) g(x) = Ax on ∂ω,

2) kg − AkC α(ω) < η

2 and kg−1 − A−1kC α(Aω) < η
2 ,

3) |{x ∈ ω : |Dg(x) − Pi| < ε}| = λi|ω| for i = 1, . . . , N .

Let ˜ω = {x ∈ ω : g is aﬃne in a neighbourhood of x and |Dg(x) − P1| > ε} and

ˆω =(cid:26)x ∈ ω :

g is aﬃne in a neighbourhood of x and

4 , we have that ˆω ⊂ ˜ω. Note also that ˆω and ˜ω
are open. Finally, the choice of ε was done so that, thanks to 3) the set of x ∈ Ω such that
|Dg(x) − P1| = ε has measure zero.

As dist(Ej+m,Sn−m
Since g is piecewise aﬃne, there exist a family {ˆωk}k∈N of open sets such that ˆω =S∞

k=1 ˆωk,
and ˆPk ∈ Rn×n, bk ∈ Rn with g(x) = ˆPkx+bk in ˆωk. Recalling that |Pi| = |A| for i = 1, . . . , N ,

We deﬁne h as the piecewise aﬃne homeomorphism given by Lemma 7 in each ˆωk and as g in
k=1 ˆωk. By Lemma 5, h is a homeomorphism, and satisﬁes (a), (b) and (e1). Property

(c) comes from (iii) in Lemma 7. By (iv) of the same lemma we have

ω \S∞

|{x ∈ ˆωk : |Dh(x)| > t}|

t > 0.

Therefore, using (43) and that for all k there exists i such that | ˆPk − Pi| < ε, we have

|{x ∈ ˆω : |Dh(x)| > t}|

|ˆω|

. |A|mt−m.

Now, by (43) and 3), we have

||Dh| − |A|| ≤ |Dh − Pi| = |Dg − Pi| < ε

a.e. in ω \ ˆω,

for some i ∈ {1, . . . , N } depending on the point. Hence |Dh| < |A| + ε a.e. in ˜ω \ ˆω. Thus, if
t > |A| + ε we have

|{x ∈ ˜ω : |Dh(x)| > t}| = |{x ∈ ˆω : |Dh(x)| > t}| . |A|mt−m|ˆω| ≤ |A|mt−m|˜ω|,

whereas, if 0 < t ≤ |A| + ε we get 1 . |A|mt−m and

|{x ∈ ˜ω : |Dh(x)| > t}| = |{x ∈ ˜ω \ ˆω : |Dh(x)| > t}| + |{x ∈ ˆω : |Dh(x)| > t}|

. |˜ω \ ˆω| + |A|mt−m|ˆω| . |A|mt−m|˜ω|.

Hence, for all t > 0,

(44)

|{x ∈ ˜ω : |Dh(x)| > t}| . |A|mt−m|˜ω|.

So using (44) and

(45)

|˜ω| = (1 − λ1)|ω| .

we have |{x ∈ ˜ω : |Dh(x)| > t}| . 2−jt−m|ω|, that is, (e2).

Finally,

|Dh(x) − A| dx ≤Z˜ω

Inequalities (46), (47) and (48) show (d) and ﬁnish the proof.

The next lemma is the analogous of the previous one when one starts with the identity

matrix. Its proof is similar to that of Lemma 10, but using Lemma 9 instead of Lemma 8.

Lemma 11. For any α ∈ (0, 1) and η > 0 there exist j1 ∈ N and a piecewise aﬃne homeo-
morphism h ∈ W 1,1(Ω, Rn) ∩ C α(Ω, Rn) satisfying

(a) h(x) = x on ∂Ω.

(b) kh − IkC α(Ω) < η and kh−1 − IkC α(Ω) < η.

(c) Dh(x) ∈ Ej1 a.e. x ∈ Ω.

(d) RΩ |Dh(x) − I| dx . 1

(e) |{x ∈ Ω : |Dh(x)| > t}| . |Ω| t−m for all t > 0.

7 Proof of the theorem

We are in a position to prove Theorem 1 using Lemmas 10 and 11.

Proof of Theorem 1. Let j1 ∈ N be as in Lemma 7. For each j ∈ N we will construct a
piecewise aﬃne homeomorphism fj ∈ W 1,1(Ω, Rn) ∩ C α(Ω, Rn) such that

32

1) fj(x) = x on ∂Ω.

2) kfj − fj−1kC α(Ω) < 2−jδ and kf −1

j − f −1

j−1kC α(Ω) < 2−jδ.

3) Dfj ∈ Ej1+(j−1)m a.e.

4) RΩ |Dfj(x) − Dfj−1(x)|dx . 2−j |Ω|.
5) |{x ∈ Ω : |Dfj(x)| > t}| . |Ω| t−mQj−1

k=0(1 − 2−k−1)−m(1 + 2−k).

The construction of fj proceeds by induction. Let f0 = id, which does not satisfy 3). We
use Lemma 11 to create a piecewise aﬃne homeomorphism f1 such that properties 1–5) hold
for j = 1.

Now suppose we have fj. Since fj is piecewise aﬃne, for each i ∈ N there exist Aij ∈ Rn×n,

bij ∈ Rn and Ωij ⊂ Ω open such that |Ω \Si Ωij| = 0 and

fj(x) = Aijx + bij,

x ∈ Ωij

and, by 3), Aij ∈ Ej1+(j−1)m. On each Ωij we apply Lemma 10: there exists a piecewise aﬃne
homeomorphism hij : Ωij → AijΩij + bij in W 1,1 and in C α such that

• hij(x) = fj(x) for x ∈ ∂Ωij.

• khij − fjkC α(Ωij ) < 2−(j+2)δ and kh−1

ij − f −1

j kC α(Ωij +bij) < 2−(j+2)δ.

• Dhij(x) ∈ Ej1+jm a.e. x ∈ Ωij.

|Dhij(x) − Aij|dx . 2−j|Ωij|.

• RΩij

• There exists an open set ˜Ωij ⊂ Ωij such that

|Dhij(x) − Aij| . 2−j a.e. x ∈ Ωij \ ˜Ωij

and (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){x ∈ ˜Ωij : |Dhij(x)| > t}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|Ωij|

. 2−j t−m.

We deﬁne the piecewise aﬃne function fj+1 : Ω → Rn as

fj+1 :=(fj(x)

hij(x)

if x ∈ Ω \Si∈N Ωij,

if x ∈ Ωij for some i ∈ N.

By Lemma 5, it is homeomorphism and, moreover, properties 1)–4) hold for j +1. In addition,

(a) ∃C > 0 depending only on n such that |Dfj+1 − Dfj| ≤ C2−j a.e. in Si(cid:16)Ωij \ ˜Ωij(cid:17).
(b) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){x ∈Si∈N

33

To get property 5) for fj+1 we proceed as follows. Let

t >

1 + 2−1C
1 + 2−2 .

On the one hand, thanks to (a) and 5),

∞

Xi=1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){x ∈ Ωij \ ˜Ωij : |Dfj+1(x)| > t}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤(cid:12)(cid:12){x ∈ Ω : |Dfj(x)| > t − C2−j}(cid:12)(cid:12)

but (t − C2−j)−m ≤ (1 − 2−j−1)−mt−m, hence

∞

Summing this estimate with that of (b) we obtain

Xi=1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){x ∈ Ωij \ ˜Ωij : |Dfj+1(x)| > t}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) . |Ω| (1 − 2−j−1)−mt−m

j−1

j−1

Yk=0

≤ |Ω| t−m

(1 − 2−k−1)−m(1 + 2−k),

j

Yk=0

so property 5) holds for j + 1. This concludes the construction of {fj}j∈N with properties
1)–5).

As in the proof of Lemma 7, property 2) implies that the sequence {fj}∞

j=1 converges in
C α to a function f that is a homeomorphism with a C α inverse. It also shows property v)
of the statement. Property 4), on the other hand, shows that {Dfj}j∈N converges in L1.
Consequently, f ∈ W 1,1(Ω, Rn).

Now, for a subsequence Dfj → Df a.e., so, thanks to the continuity of the singular values
(see, e.g., (23)), we obtain from property 3) that Df (x) ∈ Γ+ and rank (Df (x)) < m a.e. in
Ω. From the convergence Dfj → Df in measure and property 5) we have

|{x ∈ Ω : |Df (x)| > t}|

|Ω|

. t−m

(1 − 2−k−1)−m(1 + 2−k) . t−m,

∞

Yk=0

and therefore, Df ∈ Lm,w(Ω).

Finally, to prove that f is the gradient of a convex function, we apply a standard argument.
We assume, without loss of generality, that Ω is connected; otherwise, we would argue with
each connected component. Take a ball B containing Ω and deﬁne ˜f : B → Rn as f in Ω and
the identity outside Ω. Then ˜f ∈ W 1,1(B, Rn). Choose a family {ηε}ε>0 of standard molliﬁers,

34

and deﬁne fε := ˜f ∗ ηε in a ball Bε ⊂ B containing Ω. Then, Dfε(x) ∈ Γ+ for all x ∈ Bε.
ε dxi deﬁned in Bε is closed, i.e., dαε = 0,
thanks to the symmetry of Dfε. Here f i
ε are the components of fε. By Poincar´e’s lemma, αε
is exact, i.e., there exists a smooth function uε : Bε → R such that duε = αε, so ∇uε = fε.

Consequently, the diﬀerential 1-form αε :=Pn
We can take uε such thatRΩ uε = 0. As the Hessian of uε is symmetric positive semideﬁnite,

uε is convex. Now, fε → f in W 1,1(Ω, Rn) as ε → 0. Thanks to the Poincar´e inequality, there
exists u ∈ W 2,1(Ω) such that uε → u in W 2,1(Ω). Therefore, ∇u = f . Moreover, u is convex
as a limit of convex functions. Theorem 1 is proved.

i=1 f i

In fact, since in our construction the sets Ej approximate planes of dimension m − 1, our
function satisﬁes rank (Df (x)) = m − 1 a.e. in Ω. One can also see that, in our construction,
f /∈ W 1,m(B, Rn) for any open B ⊂ Ω.

8 Sharpness of the result

Theorem 1 is sharp in the following sense.

Theorem 12. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be open and bounded, and m ∈ {2, . . . , n}. Let f : Ω → Rn be a
homeomorphism in W 1,p(Ω, Rn) such that f |∂Ω = id |∂Ω. Assume one of the following:

a) p = m and f is H¨older continuous.

b) p > m.

Then rank(Df (x)) ≥ m for all x in a subset of Ω of positive measure.

To prove this theorem we need to show the validity of the area formula for restrictions to

planes of dimension m. Given f ∈ W 1,p(Ω, Rn), we deﬁne Jmf (x) =pdet Df (x)T Df (x) for

a.e. x ∈ Ω. We denote by Hm the m-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure in Rn; when Hm acts on
subsets of coordinate planes of dimension m, it can be identiﬁed with the Lebesgue measure
in Rm.

Lemma 13. Let f : Ω → Rn be injective and in W 1,p (Ω, Rn). Assume that one of the
alternatives a)–b) of Theorem 12 holds. Then for almost every y ∈ Rn−m and all Hm-
measurable sets E ⊂ Ω ∩ (Rm × {y}),

Jmf dHm = Hm (f (E)) .

ZE

Proof. By Fubini’s theorem, for a.e. y ∈ Rn−m, the restriction f |Ω∩(Rm×{y}) is in W 1,p with
respect to the Hm measure. Fix such a y. A standard approximation theorem (see, e.g.,
[14, Corollary 6.6.2]) shows that there exist sequences {fj}j∈N in C 1(Rn, Rn) and {Ej}j∈N of
disjoint Hm-measurable subsets of E ∩ (Rm × {y}) such that

f (x) = fj(x) and Df (x) = Dfj(x)

for all x ∈ Ej and j ∈ N

35

and Hm(E \S∞

j=1 Ej) = 0. Thus,

Jmf dHm =

ZE

∞

Xj=1ZEj

Jmf dHm.

Now, for each j ∈ N, thanks to the area formula for regular maps (see [17, Theorem 3.2.3])
and the fact that f is injective,

Jmfj dHm =ZRn

#{Ej ∩ f −1

j

(y)} dHm(y)

#{Ej ∩ f −1(y)} dHm(y) = Hm(f (Ej)).

Jmf dHm =ZEj

Therefore,

ZE

Jmf dHm = Hm(cid:16)f(cid:0)

∞

[j=1

Ej(cid:1)(cid:17).

Under assumptions a) or b) of Theorem 12, f |Ω∩(Rm×{y}) satisﬁes the m-dimensional Luzin
(N) condition, i.e., given A ⊂ Ω ∩ (Rm × {y}) such that Hm (A) = 0 then Hm (f (A)) = 0.
The proof under a) is due to [24, Theorem 1.1] (with λ = 0 in the notation there), while the
proof under b) is classical [26]. In either case,

Now we can prove Theorem 12.

Proof of Theorem 12. Suppose, for a contradiction, that rank(Df (x)) < m for a.e. x ∈ Ω.
Then Jmf = 0 a.e., thanks to the Cauchy–Binet formula. Then, for a.e. y ∈ Rm we have
Jmf = 0 Hm-a.e. in Ω ∩ (Rm × {y}) and, by Lemma 13,

(49)

Hm (f (Ω ∩ (Rm × {y}))) = 0.

Let Pm : Rn → Rm be the projection over the ﬁrst m coordinates: Pm (x1, . . . , xn) =
(x1, . . . , xm), and, for any y ∈ Rn−m, deﬁne the set Ωy = Pm (Ω ∩ (Rm × {y})) and the
function gy : Ωy → Rm

gy(x) = Pm (f (x, y)) .

Since f = id on ∂Ω and ∂Ωy = Pm (∂Ω ∩ (Rm × {y})), we have that gy = id on ∂Ωy. Using
now degree theory, this implies

deg (gy, Ωy, ·) = deg (id, Ωy, ·)

36

and, consequently, Ωy ⊂ gy(Ωy) (see, e.g., [12, Theorem 3.1]). Fix y ∈ Rn−m such that (49)
holds and Ωy 6= ∅. As Pm is 1-Lipschitz and Ωy is open, we ﬁnd that

0 < Hm (Ωy) ≤ Hm (gy (Ωy)) ≤ Hm (f (Ω ∩ (Rm × {y}))) ,

which contradicts (49) and completes the proof.

As can be seen from the proof, in Theorem 12 and Lemma 13, conditions a)–b) can be
replaced by any other assumption implying Luzin’s condition (N) in Rm. As mentioned in
the proof, the paper [24] shows some of those conditions.
