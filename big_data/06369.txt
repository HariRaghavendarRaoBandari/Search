The time-dependent energy transfer in a driven quantum system strongly coupled to a heat bath is studied
within an inﬂuence functional approach. Exact formal expressions for the statistics of energy dissipation into
the different channels are derived. The general method is applied to the driven dissipative two-state system. It is
shown that the energy ﬂows obey a balance relation, and that, for strong coupling, the interaction may constitute
the major dissipative channel. Results in analytic form are presented for a particular value of strong Ohmic
dissipation. The energy ﬂows show interesting behaviors including driving-induced coherences and quantum
stochastic resonances.

Introduction — Deep understanding and precise control of
energy exchange in strongly coupled systems at the quantum
level may have profound impact both from a fundamental and
a practical point of view. On one side, it can advance the
formulation of a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamics
for strong coupling. In fact, the question how to conceive a
consistent thermodynamics for nonequilibrium scenarios with
strong system-reservoir coupling has attracted recent interest
[1–5], and the issue is currently a subject of controversy. Sub-
stantial progress has recently been made for classical systems
[6]. On the applicative side, it can have great impact on the
active ﬁeld of quantum optimal control with pioneering appli-
cations in biology and information technology.

The natural setting to study energy exchange and dissipa-
tion is to consider an externally driven quantum system cou-
pled to one or several heat reservoirs [7–12]. This might also
serve as a building block in the study of more complex sys-
tems. Usually, the system-reservoir entity is studied in the
weak-coupling limit. This is technically advantageous, since
perturbative methods can be used. The weak coupling as-
sumption is well justiﬁed in the theoretical analysis of ex-
periments in which one would like to have long coherence
times. There are, however, many physical systems for which
the interaction energy is comparable with the system energy.
Among all, the most striking ones are e.g. a biomolecule in
a solvent and photosynthetic systems, in which energy is ab-
sorbed and efﬁciently transported over long distances. It is
now well-established that the vast efﬁciency of this process
cannot be explained with concepts of classical charge trans-
port. Rather it exhibits not only quantum features [13–15] but
strong interaction with a structured non-Markovian reservoir
seems to be crucial for the high transport efﬁciency [16–18].
With such motivations, it is natural to ask if similar spec-
tacular effects may arise in the energy transfer characteristics
of small and well-controlled quantum systems, when they are
externally driven and strongly coupled to a heat reservoir. The
time-dependent force is continuously pumping energy into the
system, and thus drives it out of equilibrium [19, 20]. Coin-
cidently, the strong coupling with the environment makes the
dynamics more intricate, since the system can dissipate energy

through different channels. The convoluted interplay between
all these competitive contributions and the identiﬁcation of the
dissipative channels involved is the subject of this Letter.

First, we set the stage by facing the problem from a very
general perspective. To this end we put up a functional in-
tegral approach for the characteristic function of the energy
transfer statistics, in which the dissipative channels to the
reservoir and to the interaction are identiﬁed. Then we apply
this method to the versatile spin-boson system. We establish
the energy balance relation and analyze the inherent dissipa-
tive channels. Results in analytic form are presented for a
particular value of strong Ohmic dissipation [2, 4, 21, 23]. It
is shown that the system-reservoir coupling can be the domi-
nant dissipative channel in particular regions of the parameter
space. It is found that the drive-induced coherences and quan-
tum stochastic resonance features of the model [25–28] are
reﬂected in the energy transfer characteristics.

We are interested in the energy ﬂow of the driven system
coupled strongly to the heat bath. In the usually studied weak
coupling limit, it is assumed that all the energy is dissipated
into the reservoir [6, 9, 10, 31, 32, 34, 35]. In this case, the
dissipated energy is found out by a double projective measure-
ment of the reservoir energy at the beginning and at the end of
the evolution.

If the weak coupling limit is not met, the system-bath in-
teraction represents an additional dissipative channel. In the
sequel, we present an approach which allows us to analyze the
time-dependence of the various energy transfer contributions.
In a complete description of the energy transfer, knowl-
edge of both the variations of the energy dissipated into the

reservoir, (cid:104)ER(t)(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)HR(t)(cid:105) − (cid:104)HR(0)(cid:105), and into reservoir-
plus-interaction, (cid:104)ERI(t)(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)HR(t)(cid:105) + (cid:104)HI(t)(cid:105) − (cid:104)HR(0)(cid:105) −
(cid:104)HI(0)(cid:105), is essential. Moreover the variation of energy re-
lated to the interaction can be inferred simply by the dif-
ference (cid:104)EI(t)(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)ERI(t)(cid:105) − (cid:104)ER(t)(cid:105).
It is worth to under-
line that these observables can be related to speciﬁc measure-
ment protocols. Assume that at time t ≤ 0 the system and
the bath are decoupled and the system dwells in a diagonal
state of the reduced density matrix (RDM) with probability
distribution pS(q(0)). Initially we have (cid:104)q(0)|ρ(0)|q(0)(cid:105) =
pS(q(0))e−β HR/Tr[e−β HR ], where β = 1/T is the inverse
temperature (throughout we put kB = ¯h = 1). Immediately be-
fore both the coupling with the reservoir and driving force are
switched on, at time t = 0, the bath energy is measured. At a
later time t, we either switch off the coupling and measure the
bath energy again, or we coevally measure the energy of the
bath and the coupling. These measurements may be projec-
tive [5, 6, 37] or performed with a full quantum detector [38].
The moment generating function (MGF) Gλ (ν,t) embodies
the entire statistics of these measurement protocols. Impor-
tantly, it can be written as the trace of a generalized density
operator [5, 35],

Gλ (ν,t) = Tr [eiν(HR+λ HI)Ut,0 e−iνHRρ(0)U †

t,0] .

(1)

Here Ut,0 implements the time evolution of the composite sys-
tem, and the control parameter λ serves to treat both pro-
tocols on equal footing. For λ = 0, we meet the reservoir
measurement (cid:104)ER(t)(cid:105) [5, 6]. For λ = 1, we are actually
(cid:82) dν Gλ (ν,t)e−iνEλ . The nth derivative of the MGF at ν = 0
probing (cid:104)ERI(t)(cid:105). Given the MGF Gλ (ν,t), the probability
distribution P(Eλ ,t) for the energy transfer Eλ is P(Eλ ,t) =
yields the nth moment, (cid:104)E(n)
λ (t)(cid:105) = (−i)ndnGλ (ν,t)/dνn|ν=0.
The expression (1) can be conveniently faced using a func-
tional integral approach [2, 3]. This procedure is a gener-
alization of the one exposed in [6] and the details can be
found in the Supplementary Material (SM) [39]. Here we
focus on the ﬁrst moment, i.e., the various energies trans-
ferred on average. We readily get for (cid:104)Eλ (t)(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)E(1)

Interestingly, the expression (6) for (cid:104)ERI(t)(cid:105), upon integra-

Consider the energy ﬂow until time t. Taking in (14) the
average over period 2π/ω, we get with (10) ¯EI(t) = EI,0 and
¯ER(t) = PR t − EI,0 − ES,0 + Eexc,0.
In practice, this corre-
sponds to the case, in which the oscillating terms are averaged
out during the measurement, i.e., by using a detector unable
to resolve energy variation within period 2π/ω. In the scal-

ﬁnds the asymptotic form EI,0 →
In contrast, ES,0 and Eexc,0 do not depend on ωc. Hence
we have in the scaling regime EI,0 >> ES,0, Eexc,0, and thus
¯ER(t) (cid:39) PR t − EI,0.
To understand how the energy is dissipated into the various
channels, we plot in Fig. 1 a snapshot of ¯ER(¯t) and ¯EI(¯t) at
time ¯t ≡ 50/γ as functions of frequency ω and of tempera-
ture T . The behavior of the reservoir channel is particularly
interesting as it shows a sequence of plateaus combined with
sudden ascents around ω = ε0/n, n = 1, 2, 3, 4. This resem-
bles the driving-induced coherences (DIC) and resonances in-
herent in strongly coupled system-reservoir entities [25–28].
The resonances fade away into the continuum when ε0 < ε1
is small [see inset in Fig. 1 a)], or when temperature is in-
creased.

The behavior of ¯ER(¯t) reﬂects the one of the power PR, as
depicted in the inset of Fig. 1 a). The solid curve, reporting
¯ER(¯t), is effectively an ampliﬁcation of the solid curve in the
inset, showing PR, by a factor 50/γ with a displacement along
the ordinate by roughly −EI,0. We see that in a region around
ω = 2γ there holds ¯ER(¯t) < 0, i.e., the energy EI,0 drained
away into the interaction still outstrips the amount PR¯t. Since
¯ER(¯t) depends strongly on ω and ε0, and ¯EI(t) is virtually con-
stant, the case, in which the energy dissipated into the bath is
small or large, can easily be adjusted by tuning these external
parameters.

The energies ¯ER(¯t) and ¯EI(¯t) are depicted versus tempera-
ture in Fig. 1 b). While the latter depends weakly on T , the
energy deposited in the bath has a peaked structure signifying
that the respective energy is ampliﬁed because of the noise.
This reﬂects the quantum stochastic resonance characteristics
of the driven damped quantum system [25]. Side resonances
are absent because of the relatively high temperatures. At low
T , the curve for ¯ER(¯t) falls again below ¯EI(¯t).

Finally, we turn to the oscillatory part in Eq. (14). The in-
dividual terms of the mth component represent oscillatory en-
ergy exchange between the four entries of the balance relation
(10) at frequency mω. These features can be observed with a
detector having time resolution smaller than 2π/ω. The am-
plitudes of the m = ±1 components are the largest ones. The
absolute values of the amplitudes ER,1 and EI,1 are depicted
versus ω for a particular parameter set in Fig. 2. The ampli-
tudes show distinct resonances at ω = ε0/n with n = 1,2, and
3 which are again related to the DIC. Since the phases of the
amplitudes differ by nearly π, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2,

(Color online) The absolute values of the amplitudes of the

ﬁrst harmonic ER,1 (solid curve) and EI,1 (dashed curve) are plotted
versus driving frequency ω. The parameters are the same as in Fig. 1
a). Both curves show resonances at ε0/n (indicated by the arrows).
Inset: phases of ER,1 (solid curve) and EI,1 (dashed curve) versus ω.
The two contributions are always in anti-phase.

and the absolute values are close, the major energy transfer
is between the bath and the interaction. The surplus of en-
ergy put in and out of the reservoir oscillates with amplitude
Eexc,1 − ES,1, and the absolute value of it is just the difference
of the two curves in Fig. 2. This is small since the leading
contributions to Eexc,1 and ES,1 cancel each other.

Conclusions — We presented a general method to analyze
the time-resolved energy transfer to the various dissipative
channels of a driven open quantum system strongly coupled to
a heat bath. The exact formal solution in path sum representa-
tion was given in Eqs. (2) and (3). This may serve as a starting
point for the implementation of powerful numerical schemes
[41–45]. The method was applied to the spin-boson model,
with explicit results in the Ohmic scaling limit at strong cou-
pling, for the special case of K = 1
2. We showed that the inter-
action channel is a relevant dissipative drain which even may
dominate in particular regimes of the parameters. For har-
monic driving, the energy ﬂowing into the reservoir shows dis-
tinct resonant behavior, thereby reﬂecting quantum stochastic
resonance features of the model [25, 26]. The ﬁndings may
open new directions in the study of energy transfer in com-
plex quantum systems, and pave the way to control energy
dissipation into the reservoir by tuning the system’s parame-
ters.

Here we outline the derivation of the moment generating
function (MGF) Gλ (ν,t) within the functional integral ap-
proach. The total Hamiltonian of the system-plus-reservoir
is H(t) = HS(t) + HR + HI [1–4]. We assume that at times
t ≤ 0, the system and the bath are decoupled, the system
dwells at position q(0) ≡ qi with probability pS(qi), and the
bath is in thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature β = 1/T
(hereafter we set ¯h = kB = 1). Hence we have (cid:104)qi|ρ(0)|qi(cid:105) =
pS(qi)e−β HR/ZR with ZR = Tre−β HR. We are interested in
the MGF, which includes the entire statistics of the energy ex-
change process according to the measurement protocols dis-
cussed in the Letter. Formally the MGF can be written as a
generalized density matrix [5]

Gλ (ν,t) = Tr [eiν(HR+λ HI)Ut,0 e−iνHRρ(0)U †

t,0] ,

(1)

where Ut,0 conveys the time evolution of the total system.

It is expedient to perform the reduction of the dynamics of
the composite system to that of the system alone using the
path sum approach [2, 6]. Within this framework, we then
have

ﬂuence functional Fλ [q,q(cid:48);ν] accounts for all environmental
effects on the energy transfer statistics captured by the MGF
Gλ (ν,t). Since the exponent of the integrand in (3) is a mixed
quadratic form of all the bath variables, the multiple integra-
tions can be done in closed form upon completing the squares.
It is convenient to rewrite Eq. (3) in terms of quasi-classical
path η(τ) = (q(τ) + q(cid:48)(τ))/q0 and quantum ﬂuctuation path
ξ (τ) = (q(τ) − q(cid:48)(τ))/q0, with q0 being a characteristic
length of the system. Then the MGF takes the form

only terms in the functional ε (n)

tually contribute to (cid:104)E(n)
