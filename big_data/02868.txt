Radio telescope front ends must have simultaneously low noise and suﬃciently-high linearity
to accommodate interfering signals. Typically these are opposing design goals. For modern
radio telescopes operating in the HF (3–30 MHz) and VHF-low (30–88 MHz) bands, the prob-
lem is more nuanced in that front end noise temperature may be a relatively small component
of the system temperature, and increased linearity may be required due to the particular in-
terference problems associated with this spectrum. In this paper we present an analysis of
the sensitivity-linearity trade oﬀ at these frequencies, applicable to existing commercially-
available monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) ampliﬁers in single-ended, diﬀer-
ential, and parallelized conﬁgurations. This analysis and associated ﬁndings should be useful
in the design and upgrade of front ends for low frequency radio telescopes. The analysis is
demonstrated explicitly for one of the better-performing ampliﬁers encountered in this study,
the Mini-Circuits PGA-103, and is conﬁrmed by hardware measurements. We also present a
design based on the Mini-Circuits HELA-10 ampliﬁer, which is better-suited for applications
where linearity is a primary concern.

Introduction

Modern low frequency (< 300 MHz) radio telescopes consist of dozens to thousands of low
gain antennas, the outputs of which are typically digitized so beamforming and imaging
may be performed in the digital domain. In these telescopes, each individual antenna is
integrated with a front end, which typically performs ampliﬁcation, ﬁltering, impedance
transformation, and diﬀerential to single-ended (i.e. balanced to unbalanced) conversion.
The front end must be sensitive to astrophysical signals, but must also be suﬃciently linear
to be robust to external interference. Thus there exists a trade oﬀ between sensitivity and
linearity.

In this paper we present front end design methodologies which consider sensitivity and
linearity jointly. System-level sensitivity requirements place well-known constraints on the
receiver noise temperature TR, leading to typical values in the range of a few hundred
kelvin (Ellingson, 2005). Linearity requirements are less well established. Table 1 compares
the front ends employed in some modern low frequency radio telescopes: the ﬁrst station
of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1) (Ellingson et al., 2013), the Murchison Wideﬁeld
Array (MWA) (Tingay et al., 2013), the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Low-Band (van
Haarlem et al., 2013), the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) “4-Band” system (Kassim
et al., 2007), and the Eight-meter wavelength Transient Array (ETA) (Deshpande, 2009).
To quantify the sensitivity-linearity trade oﬀ, we performed a survey of commercially-
available monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) ampliﬁers that might be consid-

ered for use in radio telescope front ends. From this survey we identiﬁed two ampliﬁers:
the Mini-Circuits (MC) PGA-103, a standout in TR, and the MC HELA-10, a standout
in linearity. We designed ampliﬁers using PGA-103s in (1) a balanced conﬁguration and
in (2) parallel conﬁguration of balanced ampliﬁers in order to improve the linearity of the
single-ended PGA-103. A front end using two HELA-10 ampliﬁers with input ﬁltering was
designed to demonstrate a front end with the highest reported linearity in a modern ra-
dio telescope. The relevant performance metrics for these new front end designs are also
included in Table 1.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the sensitivity
requirements for front ends in modern low frequency radio telescopes. In Section 3 we present
a survey of commercially-available MMIC ampliﬁers. Section 4 quantiﬁes the performance
of ampliﬁers consisting of a parallel conﬁguration of balanced ampliﬁers, in terms of the
linearity-sensitivity trade oﬀ. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 present the PGA-103 (high sensitivity)
and HELA-10 (high linearity) front ends, respectively. Section 6 presents the results of a
ﬁeld test demonstration using the front ends presented in Section 5. Our conclusions are
summarized in Section 7.

2. Noise Temperature Requirements

As in any other frequency regime, the sensitivity of a low frequency radio telescope is
determined primarily by collecting area and noise. However the extraordinarily high sky
brightness temperature at low frequencies leads to somewhat diﬀerent considerations in
design criteria and subsequent characterization of instruments.

A model for characterizing the sensitivity-limiting noise delivered to the digitizer in a
low frequency instrument is shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity this particular model assumes
that each element is individually digitized, but the principles remain relevant when analog
combining is employed. Noise captured by the antenna is conveniently characterized in
terms of antenna temperature TA. For the purposes of this paper TA is deﬁned as the power
spectral density (PSD; e.g., W Hz−1) delivered to a load which is conjugate-matched to the
antenna impedance ZA = RA+jXA, divided by Boltzmann’s constant k = 1.38×10−23 J/K.
As will be explained later, antennas used in low frequency arrays are often poorly-
matched to receivers. The eﬀect of impedance mismatch may be taken into account by
deﬁning a two-port circuit, identiﬁed as an “antenna interface” (AI) in Fig. 1, which connects
the antenna to the rest of the receiver. The AI is assumed to be perfectly-matched to the
receiver over the bandwidth of interest, and exhibits input impedance ZR = RR+jXR which
may or may not vary signiﬁcantly with frequency. In implementation terms, the AI may
be any combination of impedance transforming devices, baluns, and ﬁlters; or the AI may
simply a “null” two-port representing direct connection between the antenna and receiver.
In any event, the AI may be characterized in terms of transducer power gain GT , which in
the present problem may be deﬁned as the ratio of the PSD SAI delivered to the receiver,
to the PSD kTA “available” from the antenna. Neglecting for the moment any noise that
might originate from the AI (i.e. assuming the AI is lossless),

(Tillman & Ellingson, 2015b). The PSD subsequently delivered to the digitizer is

SR = kTAGT GR + kTRGR

(3)

(4)

where GR is the gain of the receiver and the second term accounts for the noise contribution
from the receiver, expressed as the input-referred equivalent noise temperature TR.

Front ends in low frequency radio telescopes are not typically noise-matched to the
antenna. Antenna impedance in these instruments varies dramatically, so the front end
input impedance is typically not equal to the value that would yield optimal noise ﬁgure.
As a consequence, the minimum possible TR is not obtained. However, as long as the realized
TR/GT is suﬃciently below TA, improved noise matching will have only a minor impact on
sensitivity (more on this below; see paragraph including Eq. 9). Thus, Eq. (4) is exact only
if TR is determined for the in situ input impedance, as opposed to using the value associated
with the vendor-speciﬁed impedance; but the eﬀect on the results presented here is expected
to be small since the mismatch with the antenna impedance remains large.

TA is comprised of naturally-occurring contributions Tsky from the sky and Tgnd from
the ground, plus noise associated with interference. Interfering noise originates from hu-
man activity and from natural events including lightning and solar bursts (International
Telecommunications Union, 2015). In contrast to deliberate man-made signals, man-made
noise below 300 MHz is normally negligible compared to naturally-occurring noise in the
rural locations where radio telescopes are typically built. Naturally-occurring interference
is intermittent and negligible most of the time, so the resulting antenna temperature can
be expressed as

TA = η (Tsky + Tgnd)

(5)

where η is ground loss eﬃciency. This eﬃciency accounts for near-ﬁeld coupling between
the antenna and the ground that results in loss in the ground manifesting as loss in the
antenna itself. Typical values of η range from about 0.5 (typical at 38 MHz above untreated
earth without a conducting ground screen (Ellingson, Simonetti, & Patterson, 2007)) to
very close to 1 (typical above 100 MHz or with a suﬃciently large ground screen, as in the
demonstration in Section 6). The value of Tgnd is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the ground screen.
For a perfectly-conducting inﬁnite ground screen, the apparent brightness of the ground is

Tgnd ∼150 K, i.e., ∼300 K corresponding to the physical temperature of the ground divided
by 2 since roughly half of the antenna pattern intersects the ground. For the small (O[λ2]
in area) ground screens typically used in modern instruments, the actual value of Tgnd
is somewhere between these two extremes (for example, we obtain a value of 390 K at
45 MHz for the ﬁeld experiment conducted in Section 6). Tsky in this frequency regime is
dominated by the very bright Galactic synchrotron background. The brightness temperature
of this background is somewhat brighter in the Galactic plane and somewhat dimmer in
the Galactic polar regions, however the total contribution to the antenna temperature of a
low-gain antenna isolated from ground loss is well-approximated as

(cid:16)

(cid:17)−2.55

Tsky ≈ (9120 K)

ν

39 MHz

(6)

where ν is frequency. (This expression is obtained by a ﬁt to the model described in Ap-
pendix I of (Ellingson, 2005).) This is shown in Fig. 2. Note that a diurnal variation of
about ±20% is present in this contribution, with the maximum corresponding to the transit
of the Galactic center.

Combining results, the PSD delivered to the digitizer is

SR = ηkTskyGT GR + ηkTgndGT GR + kTRGR

(7)

To convey a sense of magnitudes, Fig. 3 shows these contributions individually and together
for a simple dipole 2-m long by 2 cm in diameter. The antenna is half-wavelength resonant
at ≈ 70 MHz. In this result, ZA is obtained using an equivalent circuit model (Tang, Tieng,
& Gunn, 1993), ZR = 100 Ω, Tsky is from Eq. (6), Tgnd = 150 K, η = 1, and TR = 300 K.
The contributions are shown in the form of input-referred equivalent noise temperature,
which is essentially Eq. (7) divided by ηkGT GR so that the sum may be interpreted as
system temperature; i.e.

Tsys =

SR

ηkGT GR

= Tsky + Tgnd +

TR
ηGT

(8)

It is apparent that the noise delivered to the digitizer is dominated by Tsky over a
large fraction of the frequency range considered. This is desirable since the Galactic noise
contribution is irreducible and so any further improvements cannot signiﬁcantly improve
sensitivity. From this perspective the following “stopping criterion” for design eﬀort may
be obtained from Eq. (8):

(cid:28) η (Tsky + Tgnd)

Fig. 3. Left: Contributions to the apparent system temperature (ZR = 100Ω). Right: Tsky relative to other
sources of noise for various receiver input impedances ZR. See text for scenario details.

In other words, peak sensitivity is essentially optimized by making TR suﬃciently small
relative to the AI impedance mismatch (represented by GT ), such that further optimization
of TR or GT then has little beneﬁt.

While peak sensitivity is limited by TR/GT , it is apparent from Fig. 3 that the band-
width over which this “optimal” sensitivity is achieved may be improved by either further
reducing TR, or by expanding the bandwidth associated with GT . Further reduction in TR
is normally not attractive, since this typically entails a corresponding reduction in linear-
ity. Alternatively, the antenna may be “broadbanded” such that GT varies less over the
bandwidth of interest, or – less obvious as a solution – ZR might be increased. The broad-
banding strategy leads to “fat dipoles”; prime examples being the antenna elements used by
LWA1, MWA, and the LOFAR high-band array. In the second strategy, ZR is increased by
impedance transformation within the AI (Ellingson, 2005). This is demonstrated in Fig. 3,
where it is apparent that increasing ZR decreases peak sensitivity but increases the band-
width over which a speciﬁed minimum level of sensitivity can be achieved. Note that the
vertical axis of this plot can also be interpreted as a measure of the integration time required
to achieve a speciﬁed signal-to-noise ratio (Erickson, 2005).

3. Linearity-Sensitivity Trade oﬀ for Existing Commercially-Available

MMIC Ampliﬁers

There is a myriad of commercially available MMIC ampliﬁers that would appear to be
suitable for modern low frequency radio telescopes (see Table 1). A process for selection
of an “optimal” ampliﬁer is not obvious. However, ampliﬁers exhibit a trade oﬀ between
linearity and sensitivity, which may be used to identify exceptional ampliﬁers. To quantify
the linearity-sensitivity trade oﬀ in commercially-available MMIC ampliﬁers, we performed
a market survey of 271 devices from Mini-Circuits (MC), TriQuint, Analog Devices, Hittite
(recently acquired by Analog Devices), and Avago Technologies, all having noise ﬁgure2
(NF)<9 dB (∼ 2000 K) and advertised as suitable for operation at 50 MHz. The raw data
collected for this survey is freely available from the authors.

2NF = 10 log10 (TR/(290 K) + 1).

Fig. 4.
Left: Relationship between P1dB and IIP3 for ampliﬁers in the survey. The dashed line shows the
theoretical relationship P1dB = IIP3−9.6 dB for systems exhibiting third-order memoryless non-linearity (see
e.g. (Razavi, 2012)). Right: IIP2 and IIP3 for ampliﬁers in this survey for which both are reported. The dashed
line shows the linear least squares ﬁt. Diﬀerential ampliﬁers are identiﬁed by a diamond marker in both plots.

The linearity-sensitivity trade oﬀ was assessed by comparing the input-referred third-
order intercept point (IIP3) to TR. IIP3 is deﬁned as the power input to an ampliﬁer at which
the amplitude of the output third-order intermodulation products (i.e., the cross-frequency
terms output given a two-tone input signal) is equal to the amplitude of the fundamental
tone. Two other relevant linearity metrics are the input-referenced second-order intercept
point (IIP2), deﬁned as the power of a tone input to an ampliﬁer at which the amplitude
of the output second-order intermodulation product (i.e. second harmonic) is equal to the
amplitude of the fundamental tone; and the input 1 dB compression point (P1dB), deﬁned
as the power input to a system at which the system’s gain is reduced by 1 dB from the
expected (nominally linear) gain. IIP2 is an important consideration in receivers having high
fractional bandwidth, since the second harmonic of an interfering signal is more likely to fall
within the receiver’s pass band. However IIP2 is typically not reported by manufacturers.
On the other hand, IIP2 and P1dB were found to be highly correlated to IIP3 for the
ampliﬁers in this survey, as shown in Fig. 4. Thus, IIP3 serves as a reasonable, if imperfect,
metric for overall linearity.

The results of the survey are summarized in Fig. 5. The curves in Fig. 5 are a ﬁt by

eye to the equation

IIP3 = aF + b

(10)

where F is the noise factor (NF in linear units), IIP3 is in Watts, and the constants a and b
are selected to obtain curves that approximately bound the performance of the populations
of lower- and higher-performing ampliﬁers. The two curves are shown in Fig. 5 to illustrate
the gap between the majority of ampliﬁers (a = 250, b = −430) and outlying ampliﬁers (a =
280, b = −440). The MC PGA-103 (used in Section 5.1), HELA-10 (used in Section 5.2),
and GALI-74 (used in LWA1) are circled at (35 K, 10.4 dBm), (422 K, 39 dBm), and (250 K,
12.9 dBm), respectively.

4. Sensitivity and Linearity for Single-ended, Diﬀerential, and

Parallelized Ampliﬁer Conﬁgurations

A front end consisting of multiple MMIC ampliﬁers in balanced and/or parallel conﬁgura-
tions will have increased IIP3 and increased NF, resulting in a shift up and to the right of the
associated single-ampliﬁer front end in Fig. 5. This shift in performance can be predicted,

as will be described below.

It is also well known that linearity can be improved by distributing the input power over
two ampliﬁers arranged in a balanced conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 6; see e.g. (Engelbrecht
& Kurokawa, 1965). This can be achieved by distributing power to the ampliﬁer inputs using
a passive hybrid with outputs 180◦ out of phase, and then similarly combining from the
ampliﬁer outputs. Further improvement in linearity may be achieved by arranging single-
ended or balanced ampliﬁers in parallel, for example using hybrids for power splitting and
combining at the input and output, respectively. To the best of our knowledge an analysis
of TR and IIP3 jointly for ampliﬁers in this class of topologies has not been previously
reported.

4.1. Linearity

Consider a single ampliﬁer whose voltage (or current) transfer function is assumed to be
well-modeled as a third-order power series y(t) = a1x(t) + a2x2(t) + a3x3(t). IIP2 and IIP3
can be determined by applying a two tone signal x(t) = A[cos ω1t + cos ω2t] to the ampliﬁer.
The output signal consists of sinusoidal components representing the desired tones with
gain compression, a DC component, second and third harmonics of ω1 and ω2, second-order
intermodulation products (IM2) at ω2±ω1, and third-order intermodulation products (IM3)
at 2ω2 ± ω1 and 2ω1 ± ω2. In this case, IIP2 and IIP3 may be written in voltage or current

Next, consider a single pair of ampliﬁers in a balanced conﬁguration, as shown in Fig. 6.
The hybrids are assumed to be impedance-matched reciprocal, frequency-independent de-
vices. Further, the hybrids are characterized by a coupling factor C, which is the ratio of
power into port 1 to power out of port 2 or port 3; phase shift φ, nominally 180◦; and phase
error δ. Any loss in the splitter is included in C. As derived in Appendix A, the IIP2 and
IIP3 for the single pair of balanced ampliﬁers are

A set of N balanced ampliﬁers may be combined using power splitters/combiners (e.g.

In other words, arranging N balanced ampliﬁers in parallel improves IIP3 by a factor of N

4.2. Sensitivity

Assuming lossless hybrids, the noise power output from a balanced ampliﬁer is equal to the
noise power output from one of the constituent ampliﬁers when the input is matched. This
follows from the fact that (a) the noise from the constituent ampliﬁers is uncorrelated (Kerr,
1998), and (b) only half the noise power from each ampliﬁer appears at the output, the other
half being absorbed by the hybrid’s terminated port (see e.g. (Kurokawa, 1965)). Therefore
TR does not increase in a balanced conﬁguration relative to the NF of the constituent
single-ended ampliﬁer, as long as the hybrids are lossless.

Since practical hybrids are not perfectly lossless, the hybrids degrade the NF. If A
is the attenuation (reciprocal gain) of the hybrids, as in Fig. 8, the input-referred noise
temperature for the cascade hybrid-ampliﬁer-hybrid is

5. Design Examples

This section discusses the design and testing of two front ends to demonstrate the ﬁndings
of the previous sections. A high-sensitivity front end based on the PGA-103 is presented
in Section 5.1, as well front ends which combine multiple PGA-103s in series and parallel
conﬁgurations. A high-linearity front end based on the HELA-10 is presented in Section 5.2.

5.1. PGA-103 Based Front Ends in Various Conﬁgurations

The MC PGA-103 ampliﬁer was identiﬁed in the survey described in Section 3 as exceptional
with respect to comparable devices, particularly in its sensitivity (see Fig. 5). This device
achieves a gain of +26.8 dB with an IIP3 of 10.4 dBm and TR=36 K at 50 MHz when
biased at 90 mA. Single-ampliﬁer (N = 0), balanced (N = 1), and parallel balanced (N = 2)
versions of PGA-103-based ampliﬁers were constructed and tested. Schematic diagrams and
the tested units are shown in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. The N = 1 design uses the MC
SBTCJ-1W+ (φ = 180◦, δ = 0.4◦ typical, A=0.6 dB at 50 MHz). The N = 2 design is a
parallel combination of two N = 1 devices using MC ADP-2-1 (φ = 0◦, δ = 0.2◦ typical,
A=0.2 dB at 50 MHz) power splitter/combiners. Current provided to each ampliﬁer was
within 5% of 90 mA.

Figure 11 shows the measured gain and noise temperature for each PGA-103 front end.
As expected, gain decreases slightly for N = 1 with respect to N = 0, and N = 2 with

respect to N = 1, due to losses in the hybrids. TR increases for the same reason, as does
the power consumption, from 1.1 W for the N = 0 front end to 2.2 W and 4.3 W for the
N = 1 and = 2 front ends, respectively.

Figure 12 summarizes the test results at 50 MHz in the form of the analysis of Section 3.
For comparison, theoretical results are shown assuming both the nominal (datasheet) and
measured N = 0 ampliﬁer performance, following the analysis of the previous section and
accounting for the hybrids’ loss and phase errors. The measured TR of the N = 0 design was
within 15 K of the expected value, and the measured IIP3 was within 1 dB of the expected
value. Errors can reasonably be attributed to a combination of component manufacturing
variances and limitations of the test methods and equipment.

The N = 1 design improves IIP3 by 3.8 dB and degrades TR by 61 K; this compared
to 3.6 dB and 50 K, respectively, predicted by the analysis using datasheet values from the
N = 0 device. The N = 2 design improves IIP3 by an additional 5 dB and degrades TR
by an additional 19 K; this compared to predicted values of 3.2 dB and 16 K, respectively,
again using datasheet values for the PGA-103 and SBTCJ-1W. These results are consistent
with the analysis presented in Section 4.

For the N = 0 ampliﬁer, IIP2 was measured to be +21 dBm (no corresponding value is
provided by the manufacturer). IIP2 for the N = 1 device is predicted to increase by almost
60 dB relative to the N = 0 device, to nearly +80 dBm. The achieved value was beyond
our ability to measure (i.e. greater than +70 dBm).

5.2. A HELA-10-based Front End for Strong Interference Environments

The MC HELA-10 is the most linear MMIC ampliﬁer identiﬁed in the survey described in
Section 3. Here, we describe a new HELA-10 based front end for use between 30-80 MHz
at sites at where increased linearity is required to accommodate strong radio frequency
interference (RFI).

A block diagram and schematic of the front end are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respec-
tively. The two HELA-10 ampliﬁers are used as a pre-ampliﬁer and a line driver, respectively.
Preceding the ﬁrst ampliﬁer are notch ﬁlters designed to trap the strong signals from Cit-
izen Band (CB) and FM radio at 26.5–27.5 and 88–108 MHz, respectively. An absorptive
second-order Butterworth ﬁlter sets the bandpass of the front end to 30-80 MHz. The signal
path is diﬀerential from the antenna through the output of the front end, at which point
a balun converts the signal path to 50 Ω single-ended. The front end draws ∼0.8 A of DC
current at a DC voltage ranging from 16-20 V. Additionally, the front end implements a
three-state calibration system similar to that used by the Large aperture Experiment to
detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) (Greenhill et al., 2012) and Experiment to Detect the Global

The calibration state is determined by the DC voltage used to bias the front end (Tillman
& Ellingson, 2015a). Figure 15 shows a completed front end, aﬃxed to its enclosure, which
doubles as a heat sink.

Figure 16 shows the typical (average from the four constructed units) front end gain and
noise temperature. The measured P1dB and IIP3 are +11 dBm and +24.9 dBm, respectively,
at 50 MHz, and the achieved IIP2 was again beyond our ability to measure.

6. Field Demonstration

The goal of the demonstration is to accurately measure the Galactic noise background.
Equation 6 approximates the contribution of this background noise to the antenna temper-
ature.

A block diagram of the demonstration setup is shown in Fig. 17. The antenna used in
this demonstration is a 3.048 m long, 2.5 cm diameter, straight copper dipole positioned
parallel to and 1.524 m above a 7.6 m×7.6 m ground screen, which sits on ﬂat, grass-covered
ground. The coaxial cable is 152 m of LMR-400. The analog receiver provides a gain of about
75 dB, 15-73 MHz bandwidth (3 dB), and input-referred noise temperature of 720 K. The
coaxial cable, analog receiver, and spectrum analyzer are calibrated out and do not aﬀect
the results.

All measurements were taken in Glen Alton, VA; a rural area about 65 km northwest
of Blacksburg, VA. All measurements were taken at approximately the same local sidereal

time, within one hour. Figure 18 shows the measured PSD for each front end. The expected
HF-band RFI is present below 30 MHz, as well as the FM band between 87-108 MHz.
The large signal between 60-66 MHz is a digital television (DTV) station (Channel 3).
The total power available from the antenna (i.e., applied to the FEE input) in the spectrum
shown is approximately −22 dBm. However the signal available from the antenna is strongly
dominated by local AM stations transmitting at the 5-10 kW level, resulting in an actual
total power of at least −10 dBm from our antenna. The power associated with the AM
stations was not accurately measured at the time of the experiment and may have actually
been signiﬁcantly greater.

The antenna temperature for each front end was estimated by solving Eq. (4) for TA as

ended PGA-103 front ends were connected to the antenna through an MC ADT1-1 balun
transformer, which has a 1:1 impedance ratio and a measured insertion loss of about 0.5 dB
over the considered frequency range. The antenna impedance was estimated using Ansys
HFSS EM modeling software, and Fig. 19 shows the resulting GT . The antenna temperature
is related to the temperature distribution surrounding the antenna T (θ, φ) by (Stutzman &
Thiele, 1998)

(19)

where P (θ, φ) and ΩA are the antenna’s normalized power pattern and beam solid angle,
respectively, and dΩ = sin θdφdθ is the element of solid angle. The contributions of Tsky
and Tgnd to TA are the upper and lower hemisphere portions of the TA integral:

where we have assumed ground loss to be negligible, such that η = 1 and the ground
perfectly reﬂects the sky temperature distribution. Using a moment method model (NEC2,
assuming a ground conductivity of 5 mS/m and dielectric constant of 15) to calculate P (θ, φ)
and assuming a uniform brightness temperature distribution with a constant temperature
given by Eq. (6), we ﬁnd Tgnd ≈ 0.045Tsky across the entire frequency range of interest.
Thus, the sky temperature was estimated by Tsky = TA/1.045.

Figure 20 shows Tsky estimated using Eqs. (5) and (18) and the data collected from each
front end, and the modeled Tsky from Eq. (6). The HELA-10 front end is not noticeably
aﬀected by the interference, due in part to the highly linear HELA-10 ampliﬁers and in part
to the CB, FM, and bandpass ﬁlters. Remaining disagreement with the model is attributed
to uncertainty in the antenna impedance.

Although the N = 0 PGA-103 front end appears to be experiencing severe compres-
sion, we are not certain if this is classical gain compression, or whether it is a more complex
non-linear behavior arising from the spectral distribution of the interference (i.e., the AM-
dominated antenna output power) or some other eﬀect resulting from the power level han-
dled by a single PGA-103 in this case. The improved linearity of the balanced (N = 1) and
parallel (N = 2) PGA-103 front is apparent, as the estimated Tsky approaches the model

7. Conclusions

This paper has considered the design of front ends for modern low frequency radio telescopes
with respect to the trade oﬀ between sensitivity and linearity. A survey of commercially-
available MMIC ampliﬁers was performed and an informal analysis was used to identify the
state-of-the-art. Two outlying ampliﬁers, which outperformed the majority of comparable
ampliﬁers, were selected for demonstration. A high sensitivity front end using the PGA-103
ampliﬁer was presented with TR ≈ 50 K, however this ampliﬁer was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by
interference in a ﬁeld demonstration. A high-linearity front end using HELA-10 ampliﬁers
and CB/FM-band ﬁlters was less sensitive than the PGA-103 front end (TR ≈ 710 K), but
was robust to the interference and facilitated a greatly improved detection of the Galactic
synchrotron background.

Balanced and parallel conﬁgurations of ampliﬁers were also considered with respect to
the linearity-sensitivity trade oﬀ. Front ends employing PGA-103 ampliﬁers in balanced
and parallel conﬁgurations reduced the eﬀects of non-linearity, as expected from theory, at
a cost to both sensitivity and power consumption.
