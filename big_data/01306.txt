ZEROS OF CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF EISENSTEIN SERIES

SARAH REITZES, POLINA VULAKH, AND MATTHEW P. YOUNG

Abstract. We prove that if k and ℓ are suﬃciently large, then all the zeros of the weight
k + ℓ cusp form Ek(z)Eℓ(z) − Ek+ℓ(z) in the standard fundamental domain lie on the
boundary. We moreover ﬁnd formulas for the number of zeros on the bottom arc with
|z| = 1, and those on the sides with x = ±1/2. One important ingredient of the proof is an
approximation of the Eisenstein series in terms of the Jacobi theta function.

1.1. Statement of results. Let k ≥ 4 be an even integer and let Ek(z) denote the usual
holomorphic weight k Eisenstein series deﬁned by

(cz + d)k ,

where Γ = P SL2(Z), Γ∞ ⊂ Γ is the stabilizer of ∞, and j(γ, z) = cz + d for γ = ( a b
c d ).
Let F denote the closure of the standard fundamental domain for Γ\H, namely F = {z ∈
H : |z| ≥ 1, and |x| ≤ 1/2}. Rankin and Swinnerton-Dyer [RS-D] showed all the zeros of Ek
in F lie on the bottom arc |z| = 1.

In this paper we study the zeros of the weight k + ℓ cusp forms deﬁned by

∆k,ℓ = EkEℓ − Ek+ℓ.

(1.2)
In a few special cases, ∆k,ℓ vanishes identically, namely when (and only when) k + ℓ ∈
{8, 10, 14}. For the rest of this paper we take the convention that k + ℓ ≥ 16 to avoid these
trivial cusp forms. By symmetry we shall assume k ≥ ℓ.
The functions ∆k,ℓ are natural to study for a few reasons. The most basic motivation
comes from the fact that ∆k,ℓ are (arguably) the easiest cusp forms to construct explicitly.
In constrast, the Hecke eigenforms are rather more diﬃcult to construct for large weights.
A more advanced motivation comes from the quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) conjecture
of Rudnick and Sarnak [RS], which is an equidistribution statement for Hecke-Maass cusp
forms of large Laplace eigenvalue and for holomorphic Hecke cusp forms of large weight.
Holowinsky and Soundararajan [HS] have proven QUE for holomorphic forms. Meanwhile,
QUE for Maass forms was proved by Lindenstrauss [L] and Soundararajan [S]. In fact, in
an even earlier paper, Luo and Sarnak [LS] proved QUE for Eisenstein series in the spectral
aspect. One may wonder if there is an analog of QUE for large weight Eisenstein series. Of
course, E2
k is not a cusp form, so it is natural to project this form onto the cuspidal subspace,
which is precisely ∆k,k. It is an obvious generalization to examine ∆k,ℓ for general k, ℓ.

Many authors have studied the zeros of modular forms, including [RS-D] [AKN] [K] [G]

[DJ], [N] [GS].

In general we are interested in how these cusp forms ∆k,ℓ behave. On the one hand, one
may expect that ∆k,ℓ has similar properties as a random linear combination of Hecke cusp
forms of weight k + ℓ. If so, then one would expect that its zeros would equidistribute in
the funamental domain as the zeros of Hecke cusp forms do, due to work of Rudnick [R] and
Holowinsky and Soundararajan [HS]. In constrast to this naive guess, we have

Conjecture 1.1. All the zeros of ∆k,ℓ lying in the standard fundamental domain are on the
boundary, |z| = 1 or x = ±1/2.

This conjecture was born out of numerical evidence for k, ℓ ≤ 100. Our main result in this

paper proves the conjecture for ℓ suﬃciently large.

Theorem 1.2. There exists an eﬀective constant L so that if k ≥ ℓ ≥ L, then all the zeros
of ∆k,ℓ in F lie on its boundary.

The zeros naturally split up into those on the arc, with |z| = 1, and those on the sides,
with x = ±1/2 (there may also be “trivial” zeros at ρ and i which are guaranteed by the
valence formula depending on the value of k + ℓ modulo 12, which we do not count in this
dicussion). One of the curious features of the functions ∆k,ℓ is that the relative proportion
of zeros on the arc and on the sides depends strongly on the relative sizes of k and ℓ. In
particular, in one extreme direction if k = ℓ then it appears all the zeros are on the sides.
In the opposite extreme, if ℓ = 4 and k ≥ 12, then all the zeros are apparently on the arc.

where vi(f ) and vρ(f ) are the orders of vanishing of f at i and ρ = eπi/3, respectively.

Thus, Conjecture 1.1 is equivalent to the formula

(1.4)

Ak,ℓ + Bk,ℓ = k+ℓ

12 − 1

2vi(∆k,ℓ) − 1

3 vρ(∆k,ℓ) − 1,

where the term −1 accounts for the zero at ∞. Let us agree to call the zeros at i, ρ, and
∞ guaranteed to exist by the valence formula the trivial zeros, and the rest of the zeros the
nontrivial zeros.

Conjecture 1.3. For k ≥ 14, all of the zeros of ∆k,4, ∆k,6, and ∆k,8 in the fundamental
domain lie on the arc |z| = 1.
Proposition 1.4. For ℓ large enough, each of ∆ℓ,ℓ, ∆ℓ+2,ℓ, ∆ℓ+4,ℓ, ∆ℓ+6,ℓ, and ∆ℓ+10,ℓ have
its nontrivial zeros on the sides x = ±1/2. For ℓ large, ∆ℓ+8,ℓ has one nontrivial zero on the
arc |z| = 1, and all the rest on the sides x = ±1/2.

These special cases exemplify a more general pattern that when k − ℓ is large, ∆k,ℓ tends
to have more zeros on the arc, while when k − ℓ is small, ∆k,ℓ tends to have more zeros on
the sides.

In this paper, we shall produce tight bounds on the sizes of Ak,ℓ and Bk,ℓ, culminating in
exact formulas for these quantities. Since the formulas are somewhat complicated and break
into cases, we shall proceed in stages, giving more accurate estimates as we go.

As a starting point, we state the following

Proposition 1.5. For k ≥ ℓ ≥ 14, we have Ak,ℓ = k−ℓ
the implied constants are absolute (that is, uniform in k, ℓ).

12 + O(1), and Bk,ℓ = 2ℓ

12 + O(1), where

Since the total number of zeros of a weight k + ℓ modular form is k+ℓ

12 + O(1), Proposition
1.5 shows that all but a bounded number of zeros of ∆k,ℓ are on the boundary. It is much
more diﬃcult to show all the zeros of ∆k,ℓ are on the boundary. Our method of proof shows
the ostensibly weaker lower bounds Ak,ℓ ≥ k−ℓ
12 + O(1), but once these
lower bounds are established, the corresponding upper bounds follow by (1.4).

12 + O(1), and Bk,ℓ ≥ 2ℓ

We also have the following explicit lower bounds.

Proposition 1.6. Suppose k ≥ ℓ ≥ 14, and k − ℓ = 12n + j with n ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ j < 12.
Then Ak,ℓ ≥ Nk,ℓ, where

Proposition 1.7. Suppose k ≥ ℓ ≥ L where L is large. Then Bk,ℓ ≥ Tk,ℓ, where

(mod 6).

Ak,ℓ + Bk,ℓ ≤ k−ℓ

Propositions 1.6 and 1.7, together with (1.3), immediately imply Proposition 1.5.
In a handful of cases, the lower bounds in Propositions 1.6 and 1.7 may be elevated to
equalities. If j ∈ {4, 10} and ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6), then Propositions 1.6 and 1.7 give Ak,ℓ + Bk,ℓ ≥
n + ⌊ℓ/6⌋ − 1. On the other hand, the valence formula (1.3) gives
12 − 1
(1.7)
If j = 4 and ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6), this simpliﬁes as
Ak,ℓ + Bk,ℓ ≤ n + ⌊ℓ/6⌋ + 2
(1.8)
Furthermore, the valence formula (1.3) implies νi(∆k,ℓ) ≡ 0 (mod 2) and νρ(∆k,ℓ) ≡ 2
(mod 3), and thus Ak,ℓ + Bk,ℓ ≤ n + ⌊ℓ/6⌋ − 1. The only way this upper bound is consistent
with the lower bounds is if Ak,ℓ = n and Bk,ℓ = ⌊ℓ/6⌋ − 1. A similar argument works for
j = 10.
However, in many cases, Propositions 1.6 and 1.7 are oﬀ by one or two zeros, as will be

Although it is not easy to directly compare Table 1 to Proposition 1.6, one can certainly
read oﬀ the fact that Propositions 1.6 and 1.7 are not equalities in all cases. The reason is
that if ℓ is held ﬁxed and k is increased by 12, then ∆k+12,ℓ has one more zero than ∆k,ℓ,
and the naive expectation is that Ak+12,ℓ = Ak,ℓ + 1, and Bk+12,ℓ = Bk,ℓ. However, the tables
give that A82,22 = A70,22, and B82,22 = B70,22 + 1, for instance.

We gather a reﬁned bound with the following.

Theorem 1.8. Let k − ℓ = 12n + j with ℓ ≥ 14, n ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ j < 12. Then Ak,ℓ ≥ N′k,ℓ
where N′k,ℓ is given by the following table of values:

To compare the lower bound in Theorem 1.8 with some data, see Table 3. What is
apparently true from the table (and indeed is proven in Corollary 1.12 below) is that for k
suﬃciently large compared to ℓ, Ak,ℓ = N′k,ℓ. Note that for ℓ = 24, this stabilization in the
diﬀerence between Ak,ℓ and N′k,ℓ has already occured by k = 56, while for ℓ = 22, such a
stabilization does not occur until ℓ = 78.

The corresponding behavior of Bk,ℓ is more complicated to state. The diﬃculty is that k
needs to be large enough for the value of Bk,ℓ to stabilize; in the case of Ak,ℓ the lower bound
in Theorem 1.8 is true, but not always sharp, except if k is large. The size of k required
turns out to depend on k − ℓ (mod 6), and on ℓ (mod 6). Towards this end, we deﬁne the
following function.

Deﬁnition 1.9. Let k−ℓ = 12n+j, with 0 ≤ j < 12. Set spj(ℓ) = ℓ, except for the following

Remark. Here sp stands for “stablization point,” and is intended to represent how large
k needs to be compared to ℓ for the values of Ak,ℓ and Bk,ℓ to stabilize to their limiting
behaviors.

Theorem 1.10. Let k ≥ ℓ ≥ L, where L is some large absolute (eﬀective) constant. Then
Bk,ℓ ≥ T ′k,ℓ, provided k ≥ spj(ℓ), where

(1.10)

(1.11)

⌊ℓ/6⌋ − 1,

⌊ℓ/6⌋,

ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6),
ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6),
ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6).

As an example to illustrate Theorem 1.10, note that when ℓ = 22 ≡ 4 (mod 6), Table 2
indicates that the value of Bk,ℓ perhaps stablizes at k = 82 (but certainly not at k = 70).
For comparison, we have sp0(22) = 81, so indeed 82 is where the value stablizes in this
example. As another example, numerical calculations indicate B56,42 = 5 and B68,42 = 6;
here ℓ = 42 ≡ 0 (mod 6), and j = 2. We have sp2(42) = 57, which is in agreement with the
theorem.

From Theorems 1.8 and 1.10, we deduce

Corollary 1.11. Suppose k ≥ ℓ ≥ L, k − ℓ = 12n + j with n ≥ 1, and k ≥ spj(ℓ). Then
Ak,ℓ + Bk,ℓ is bounded from below by the following table of values:

One can check by a tedious but straightforward calculation that (1.12) agrees with ⌊ k+ℓ

that this calculation does not require n ≥ 1; the only possible caveat is that when the table
gives a negative value, that implies k + ℓ ≤ 14, which are degenerate situations that we are
avoiding anyway.

Therefore, we deduce

Corollary 1.12. Suppose k ≥ ℓ ≥ L, k − ℓ = 12n + j with n ≥ 1, and k ≥ spj(ℓ). Then
all the zeros of ∆k,ℓ in the standard fundamental domain lie on the boundary. Furthermore,
the lower bounds on Ak,ℓ and Bk,ℓ given in Theorems 1.8 and 1.10 are equalities, that is,
Ak,ℓ = N′k,ℓ and Bk,ℓ = T ′k,ℓ.

When ℓ ≤ k < spj(ℓ), then there is still one unaccounted for zero of ∆k,ℓ. For this, we

have
Proposition 1.13. Suppose that L ≤ ℓ ≤ k < spj(ℓ), and k − ℓ = 12n + j with n ≥ 1. Then
Ak,ℓ ≥ N′k,ℓ + 1.

This provides the ﬁnal missing zero, and shows that if ℓ ≥ L, then all the zeros of ∆k,ℓ
in F lie on the boundary, provided k = 12n + j with n ≥ 1. The cases with n = 0 are
covered by Proposition 1.4. Altogether, the subsidiary results described above combine to
give Theorem 1.2.

Rudnick [R, Theorem 2] showed that if a family of cusp forms fk satisﬁes QUE1, then the
zeros of the fk become equidistributed in F . Our results on the zeros here then show that
∆k,ℓ do not satisfy QUE as k + ℓ → ∞. It could be interesting to show directly that ∆k,ℓ
have escape of mass (if true).
The assumption that ℓ ≥ L in the above results is intended to simplify and shorten the
proofs throughout this paper. A value of L could certainly be calculated with more work,
but it is unlikely that ℓ = 4 (for instance) would be covered by this method. The ﬁrst-named
author has shown for ℓ = 4, 6, 8 that ∆k,ℓ has all its zeros on the arc (we omitted the proof
from this paper for brevity). For any particular value of k and ℓ, a computer can calculate
Ak,ℓ and Bk,ℓ, so it seems feasible that Conjecture 1.1 could be proved using this strategy.

It is also interesting to study the ﬁner distribution of the zeros of ∆k,ℓ. Our work in this
paper shows that ∆k,ℓ has a zero on the arc in each interval of the form (m 2π
k−ℓ) ⊂
( π
3 , π
2 ), provided k − ℓ → ∞, except possibly for a bounded number of zeros near eiπ/3. From
this, we may conclude that the zeros of ∆k,ℓ on the arc equidistribute on the arc uniformly
with respect to θ, as k − ℓ → ∞. Similarly, ∆k,ℓ has a zero on the line x = 1/2 between
the points 1/2 + iym and 1/2 + iym+1, where 1/2 + iym = Reiθm, with θm = πm
3 , π
2 ),
provided ℓ is large. Thus the zeros of ∆k,ℓ on the line x = 1/2 equidistribute according to
their argument, as ℓ → ∞.
1.2. Overview. For context, we summarize the method of Rankin and Swinnerton-Dyer
[RS-D] showing that all the zeros of Ek lie on the arc. Let Fk(θ) = eikθEk(eiθ), so that by
(1.1), we have

Now Fk is real-valued and vanishes if and only if Ek(eiθ) vanishes. Explicitly evaluating the
terms with c2 + d2 ≤ 2, and quoting a bound from [RS-D] for the terms with c2 + d2 ≥ 5, we
derive

Fk(θ) = 2 cos( kθ

these points. A careful count of these points, and a comparison to the valence formula (1.3),
shows that this accounts for all the zeros of Ek.

Our work here follows the same general method of approximating ∆k,ℓ and evaluating it at
a collection of sample points. Our approximation is more complicated because it is necessary
to retain more terms, as indicated in (1.14). The analysis of the sample points along the arc
becomes most intricate near the corner point eiπ/3.

We also separately perform an approximtion for ∆k,ℓ along the side x = 1/2. For small
values of y (which turns out to be the rather wide range 1 ≪ y ≪ k1/2+o(1)), we can safely
discard the terms in (1.1) with c2 + d2 ≥ 5, similarly to (1.14). Meanwhile, for y ≫ k1/2+o(1),
it is easiest to apply the Fourier expansion, which recall takes the form

(1.16)

It turns out that the Fourier expansion is well-approximated by a single term n ≈ k
2πy ,
in this range. The problem now is that the range with y ≍ k1/2 is not covered by these
two types of approximations. We have been able to cover this range by the approximation
Ek(z) = 1 +Pd∈Z(z + d)−k +P|c|≥2(. . . ), with the sum over |c| ≥ 2 being a small error term.
Then we develop a more precise approximation for Pd∈Z(z + d)−k in terms of the Jacobi

theta function, which recall is deﬁned by by

(1.18)

θ(w, τ ) =Xn∈Z

exp(πin2τ + 2πinw),

for τ ∈ H and w ∈ C. This feature of the Eisenstein series is of independent interest, and
should be useful for other investigations into the behavior of large weight Eisenstein series.
See Theorem 3.1 below for this result.

The Jacobi theta function satisﬁes the modularity relation

(1.19)

θ(w/τ,−1/τ ) = (−iτ )1/2 exp(πiw2/τ )θ(w, τ ).

The use of the modularity relation turns out to be crucial for approximations throughout
the transition region y ≍ k1/2. Of course, modularity of the theta function, and the Fourier
expansion of the Eisenstein series, are both applications of the Poisson summation formula,
so it is no surprise that these are reﬂections of this fact.

Remark. In the forthcoming work, we shall apply variations on Corollary 2.3, which all
follow the same steps indicated in (2.5). We have found it easiest to simply repeat the
argument on demand.

2.2. Estimates for the Eisenstein series on the arc. Similarly to the method of Rankin
and Swinnerton-Dyer discussed in Section 1.2, we shall work with FkFℓ − Fk+ℓ, which is real-
valued and vanishes if and only if ∆k,ℓ vanishes.
Lemma 2.4. For θ ∈ [ π

Using that (2 cos( θ

we then easily obtain a bound on |Rk,ℓ(θ)| that is decreasing in both k, ℓ. Evaluating the
bound at k = ℓ = 14, we derive that

2 × 2−ℓ/2 + 2 × 2−k/2 + 2−k/2 + 2−ℓ/2 ≤ 6 × 2−7 = 0.046 . . . . Adding this with (2.11) gives
the desired result.

2.3. Sample points. Our goal now is to count sign changes of FkFℓ − Fk+ℓ by ﬁnding a
sequence of points where this function changes sign. Write k − ℓ = 12n + j for n ≥ 1
and j ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. We claim that FkFℓ − Fk+ℓ exhibits sign changes at the points
θm = 2mπ
12n+j where m ranges over integers such that θm ∈ ( π
2 ] (equivalently, m ∈
(2n + j

j = 0, 2, 6 and n + 1 if j = 4, 8, 10.

as claimed. It is useful to note that the above proof of (2.22) did not use that ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6),
so we may use this bound again for the other residue classes of ℓ. Inserting these bounds
into (2.20), we derive

6 + π/3

(2.23)

(−1)rMk,ℓ(θm) ≥ 2[1 − 1

We ﬁnish the case ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6) by considering the values of m such that π
The bound (2.22) remains valid. Lemma 2.2 gives

which leads to an even better bound than (2.23).

Now suppose π

Therefore, for θm in this range we have an even better bound than (2.26).

(cid:3)

Since the error term in (2.8) is smaller than the lower bound in Proposition 2.5, we may
deﬁnitively conclude that FkFℓ − Fk+ℓ alternates signs at the values of θm ∈ ( π

counting the number of such sample points, as described in Section 2.3, we ﬁnish the proof
of Proposition 1.6.

2.4. The extra zero. Our task in this section is to prove Theorem 1.8. By comparison with
Proposition 1.6, we need to produce one additional zero when ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6) and j = 0, 6,
and when ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6) and j = 0, 2, 6, 8.
Proposition 2.6. Suppose ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6), ℓ ≥ 14, and k − ℓ = 12n + j, with n ≥ 1. For
j = 0, 6, we have that Ak,ℓ ≥ n.
Proposition 2.7. Suppose ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6), ℓ ≥ 14, and k − ℓ = 12n + j, with n ≥ 1. For
j = 0, 2, 6, we have that Ak,ℓ ≥ n. In addition, for j = 8, we have that Ak,ℓ ≥ n + 1.

These two propositions provide the extra zero not counted by Proposition 1.6. Notice that

there is essentially no condition on the size of k, although it is required that ℓ ≥ 14.
Proof of Proposition 2.6. We will show there is one additional sign change near θ = π/3.

First, suppose j = 0, so k − ℓ = 12n. Consulting the proof of Proposition 2.5, we see that
the sample point closest to π/3 is θm with m = 2n + 1, in which case Proposition 2.5 gives
Mk,ℓ(θ2n+1) ≤ −1.5. Meanwhile, directly evaluating Mk,ℓ(π/3) using (2.7), we have
6 ))−ℓ + 2 cos( ℓπ

Therefore FkFℓ − Fk+ℓ changes sign at least one more time between π
m = 2n + 2, so Mk,ℓ(θ2n+2) ≥ 1.5. On the other hand, direct evaluation shows Mk,ℓ( π
and so there is one more sign change in this case also.

the nearest point is θ2n+2 = π

parison to (2.8) is large enough to conclude that FkFℓ − Fk+ℓ > 0 at φ.
whereby Mk,ℓ(θ2n+1) ≤ −0.8. By evaluating (2.7) at π/3, we have
(2.38)

3 )(iℓ)(i−ℓ) + 2 cos( π

3 )(iℓ)(i−ℓ) = 3,

Mk,ℓ( π

3 ) = 1 − 2 cos( 2π

so this gives us one additional sign change. If j = 8, the calculation is similar to j = 2,
except the nearest sample point is θ2n+2, whereby Mk,ℓ(θ2n+2) ≥ 0.8, but then Mk,ℓ( π
3 ) = −3,
so the conclusion is the same as for j = 2.

(cid:3)

2.5. The case n = 0. When n = 0, then Proposition 1.4 claims that Ak,ℓ = 0 unless j = 8,
in which case Ak,ℓ = 1. Happily, all we need to prove about Ak,ℓ is that Ak,ℓ ≥ 1 when
k − ℓ = 8. The necessary results on Bk,ℓ required for Proposition 1.4 appear in Section 4
(these results are not sensitive to the value of k − ℓ, so there is no special consideration of
the case n = 0 for Bk,ℓ).
Taking this for granted for a moment, let us pause to see how this implies Proposition 1.4.
Using the lower bound from Theorem 1.10 in the cases where spj(ℓ) = ℓ, which are all the
cases but those given in (1.10), and otherwise using Proposition 1.7, we obtain the following
table of lower bounds on Bk,ℓ:

(2.39)

.

This agrees with the table in (1.12), when n = 0, except that in the row j = 8, the lower
bound on Bk,ℓ in (2.39) is one less than in (1.12). Using Ak,ℓ ≥ 1 for j = 8, then shows that
the table in (1.12) holds also for n = 0, and thus shows Proposition 1.4.
Now we proceed to show the existence of this zero. Lemma 2.4 holds when n = 0, for

ℓ ≥ 14. We have

Mℓ+8,ℓ(θ) = 2 cos(4θ) + 2 cos(4θ + ℓθ

Note that

(2.41)
so we need to ﬁnd a negative value of Mℓ+8,ℓ(θ). When ℓ ≡ 2 (mod 6), we have Mℓ+8,ℓ(π/3) =
−3, which easily gives the desired sign change. We need to work a little harder for the other
congruence classes.

3. Approximation formulas for the Eisenstein series

In this section we derive some formulas that will aid our understanding of Ek along the
line x = 1/2. Our mindset has been to obtain asymptotic approximations and to avoid
estimates with explicit constants, in order to simplify the presentation. One basic feature is
that Ek is close to 1, so we need to focus on the behavior of Ek − 1. Actually, it is helpful
to re-scale, and instead look at

and

Gk(z) := zk(Ek(z) − 1),

Finally, we focus on the largest values of y, which are naturally treated with the Fourier

Therefore, the error term is good if y ≫ √k with a large enough implied constant (which then

means the main term in (3.39) does indeed consist of a single term). In the complementary

shows

(3.50)
Q(k, 2πNy) ≪ exp(−C/4),
and likewise for P (k, 2πMy) provided k − 2πMy ≥ Ck1/2.

Lemma 3.8 leads to a very close approximation if say y ≥ k3/5 (anything slightly larger

For this, all we need to notice is that for y ≫ √k and |x| ≤ 1/2, that |z/y|k ≍ 1.

Next we specialize Theorem 3.1 to the case where x = 1/2 which is required for under-
standing zeros on the sides of the fundamental domain. The formulas simplify.
In polar
coordinates, 1/2 + iy = Reiθ where R = (1/4 + y2)1/2. With φ deﬁned by θ + φ = π

tan(θ) = 2y).

(3.62)

Gk(1/2 + iy) = 1 +

(1/2 + iy)k

(−1/2 + iy)k + O(y exp(−k1/5)).

Since Hk(z) = (|z|/z)kGk(z), we then derive
(3.63)

Hk(1/2 + iy) = 2(−1)k/2 cos(k arctan 1

which gives (3.52).

Note that n2 + n ≥ 0 for all n ∈ Z, and that for n 6= 0,−1, then n2 + n ≥ 2. Therefore, if
r ≫ 1 we get a good approximation by selecting the terms n = 0,−1, and trivially bounding
the rest. This gives

|Hk(1/2 + iy) − (−1)k/2eik arctan( 1

This gives (3.54), using k−2/3y ≪ k−1/6.

21

In the region k1/2 ≪ y ≪ k3/5 (which implies r ≫ 1), then we do not get a close
approximation by dropping all terms but n = 0,−1. In this case, we instead use (3.37) in
(3.64). Simplifying, we get
(3.68) Hk(1/2 + iy) = (−1)k/2r1/2 exp(cid:16) π
2πy(cid:17)2(cid:17) + O(k−1/15).
Under the additional assumption (3.56), we may change variables n → n + N, giving

making a new error term. For n = 0, we have

We now show that in (3.69) we may remove the error term in the exponential without

exp(O(rk−2N 2)) = 1 + O(k−1),

(3.70)
which leads to an acceptable error term since k−1r1/2 ≪ yN k−3/2 ≪ k−9/10. Meanwhile, for
n 6= 0 we may assume n ≪ r−1/2(log k)2, whence k−1r|n|N ≪ k−1/2(log k)2 . Then we have
(3.71) X0<|n|≪ (log k)2

Now the term n = 0 gives a good approximation, so by bounding the tail trivially we

obtain (3.57).

Finally we turn to (3.59). By Corollary 3.9, we have that n = N is the only term appearing

in the sum, giving

We shall also ﬁnd it convenient to record the following “trivial” bound.

Corollary 3.11. Suppose z = 1/2 + iy ∈ F . Then Hk(z) ≪ (1 + y√k
Proof. The bounds in Corollary 3.10 are easily seen to be O(1) for y ≪ k1/2 (with any ﬁxed
implied constant), so now assume y ≫ k1/2.
It suﬃces to show the desired bound for Gk(z), since |Gk(z)| = |Hk(z)|. The error term
in Corollary 3.3 is satisfactory, so we need to prove the bound for zkPd∈Z(z + d)−k. Next
we combine (3.38) with (3.39) with C > 0 large (but ﬁxed), so that the right hand side of
(3.39) has a single summand, with n = k
2πy (1 + δ), and δ ≪ k−1/2. We have |z/y|k ≪ 1, by
a Taylor approximation, and similarly to the proof of (3.59), we have

We shall occasionally ﬁnd it useful to study derivatives, especially at the corner point
eπi/3. Our ﬁrst claim is that (3.2) holds uniformly in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of
z = eπi/3. Since this point lies on the boundary of F , the proofs need to be adjusted slightly.
Since our previous analysis was designed to hold for large values of y, we found it easiest to
revisit the previous proofs. We have
Lemma 3.12. Suppose 2/5 ≤ x ≤ 3/5 and 2−1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1. Then

From this one may conclude, in a quantitative way, that the sign of Hk(1/2 + iym) is the
same as (−1)m, for all m, provided k is large enough for the error term to be negligible. A
key point is that the set of r’s for which Φ0(r) < 2 and Φ1(r) < 1 overlap, which is apparent
from Figure 3.1.
Proof. For the values of ym with ym ≤ 100k1/2, this immediately follows from Corollary
3.10, since cos(kθm) = (−1)m, so assume ym ≫ k1/2. Let φm = π
k , so that
tan(φm) = 1

2ym
that m runs over the integers in the interval [k/3, k/2)). Say m = k

. Since ym ≫ k1/2, this means φm ≪ k−1/2, and so m = k

with P ≪ √k. Then by standard Taylor approximations, we have

Since k−2p2 ≪ k−1, this value of y satisﬁes (3.56) with N = p, and so the conditions required
to apply Corollary 3.10 with y ≫ k1/2 are met. Thus, for ym ≫ k1/2, Hk(1/2 + iym) has the
same sign as (−1)p+ k

2 = (−1)m, as desired.

We shall need a result analogous to Lemma 2.2.

4.2. Proof of Proposition 1.7. We restate Proposition 1.7 for convenience:
Proposition 4.3. Suppose ℓ is large. Then ∆k,ℓ has at least ⌊ℓ/6⌋ − 1 zeros on x = 1/2 if
ℓ ≡ 2, 4 (mod 6), and at least ⌊ℓ/6] − 2 zeros on x = 1/2 if ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6).
Proof. By direct calculation, we have

(4.4)

∆k,ℓ = EkEℓ − Ek+ℓ = (Ek − 1) + (Eℓ − 1) + (Ek − 1)(Eℓ − 1) − (Ek+ℓ − 1).

Recalling the deﬁnition (3.1), we have

Suppose that Qℓ is the number of integers m such that θm = πm

Our goal is to show that ∆k,ℓ exhibits sign changes along the points 1/2 + iym = Reiθm,
which then implies Proposition 4.3

Suppose k ≥ ℓ. Then we rearrange (4.5) as
|z|k+ℓ∆k,ℓ(z) = |z|k(cid:16)Hℓ(z) +

(4.8)

Hk(z)

|z|k−ℓ(cid:17) + Hk(z)Hℓ(z) − Hk+ℓ(z).

If y ≫ 1, with a large enough implied constant (not depending on k or ℓ), then we claim
that |z|k+ℓ∆k,ℓ(1/2 + iym), with 1/2 + iym = riθm, θm = πm
2 ), has the same sign as
(−1)m, provided that ℓ is large enough. For this, we use Corollary 3.11 which then implies
(4.9)

ℓ ∈ ( π

3 , π

|z|k+ℓ∆k,ℓ(z) = |z|k(cid:16)Hℓ(z) + O(cid:16)1 + y√k

y2 (cid:17)(cid:17) + O((1 + k−1/2y)(1 + ℓ−1/2y)),

under the extra assumption k > ℓ, while if k = ℓ, we simply write
|z|2ℓ∆ℓ,ℓ(z) = 2|z|ℓHℓ(z) + O((1 + ℓ−1/2y)2).

(4.10)
In either case, Proposition 4.1 shows that ∆k,ℓ(1/2 + iym) has the same sign as (−1)m, for ℓ
large enough, and y large enough.
Now suppose that y ≪ 1. Then we temporarily forget that y = ym, and refer to (3.53),

which gives

(4.11)

where z = 1/2 + iy = Reiθ, and

|z|k+ℓ∆k,ℓ(z) = 2|z|kPk,ℓ(θ) + O(exp(−ℓ1/6)),

Pk,ℓ(θ) = cos(ℓθ) +

|z|k−ℓ +
Now we express Pk,ℓ(θm) in simpliﬁed form by a change of variables. In terms of the variables
q, a, d, we have cos(ℓθm) = (−1)m = (−1)d,
(4.13)
and similarly cos((k + ℓ)θm) = cos((k − ℓ)θm). Let us also write k − ℓ = D. Combining these
formulas, we derive

cos(kθm) = cos(ℓθm + (k − ℓ)θm) = (−1)d cos((k − ℓ)θm),

4.3. The extra zero. In this section, we prove Theorem 1.10. Comparing with Proposition
1.7, we see that when ℓ ≡ 0, 4 (mod 6), we need to produce an additional sign change, under
appropriate conditions on k, ℓ. Consulting Section 4.2, we see that if a = 0, the sample point
nearest to π
ℓ , and Pk,ℓ(θ2q+1) < 0. Meanwhile, for a = 4, the nearest point
is θ2q+2 = π

3 is θ2q+1 = π
3 + 2π

3ℓ , and Pk,ℓ(θ2q+2) > 0.

Let us ﬁrst examine the easiest cases where π

3 is an acceptable sample point. If k + ℓ 6≡ 0
(mod 6), then ∆k,ℓ(eπi/3) = 0, so we need to assume k + ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6). Then by (4.12), we
have

(mod 6).

This furnishes the desired additional zero.

Now we examine the harder cases where k + ℓ 6≡ 0 (mod 6). First suppose k + ℓ ≡ 4

(mod 6), which is the case where ∆k,ℓ has a single zero at eπi/3. Recall that

(4.27)

that Hk(1/2 + iy) = 2 cos(kθ) + O((37/17)−k/2), so by Corollary 3.15, that d
dθ Hk(1/2 + iy) =
−2k sin(kθ) + O(2−k/2) (and likewise for the second derivative, though this is not necessary
for this case). Gathering these facts, we derive

(4.28)

(4.29)

P ′k,ℓ( π

By a direct calculation (using Mathematica for simplicity), we derive

d
dθ|z|ℓ∆k,ℓ(1/2 + iy)|θ=π/3 =
3 ) =(√3(2ℓ − k),
√3(2k − ℓ),

d
dθ

Pk,ℓ(θ)|θ=π/3 + O(k 2−ℓ/2).

ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6), k ≡ 0 (mod 6)
ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6), k ≡ 4 (mod 6).

When a = 0, that is, ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6), then P ′k,ℓ( π
3 ) > 0, since k ≥ ℓ, while the nearest sample
point to π/3 had a negative value of Pk,ℓ. Therefore, there exists a positive value of Pk,ℓ near
to π/3. This exhibits an additional sign change.
For a = 4, that is, ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6), then P ′k,ℓ( π

3 ) < 0 for k > 2ℓ (which, by the way, implies
k ≥ 2ℓ + 4), while the nearest sample point has a positive value of Pk,ℓ, so this will provide
an additional sign change here also, provided k2−ℓ/2 is small compared to k − 2ℓ. However,
this is always true, since we assume ℓ is suﬃciently large. In all, this provides the additional
zero for suﬃciently large k, ℓ.

Similarly, for the second derivative, we derive

(4.30)

P ′′k,ℓ( π

3 ) =(2(2k2 + k(−2ℓ + 1) − ℓ2 − ℓ),
2(−k2 + k(4ℓ − 1) − ℓ2 − ℓ),

ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6), k ≡ 2 (mod 6)
ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6), k ≡ 4 (mod 6).

Of course, the ﬁrst derivative vanishes in this case. Consider the case ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6). Then
the polynomial value satisﬁes

(4.31)

where

(4.32)

2k2 + k(−2ℓ + 1) − ℓ2 − ℓ = 2(k − x+)(k − x−),

ℓ − 1 ± √3ℓ2 − 1

2

.

x± =

We see that if k > x+, which is precisely the condition k ≥ spj(ℓ) in this case, then certainly
P ′′k,ℓ( π
3 ) ≥ 2. This is much larger than k22−ℓ/2 unless ℓ ≪ log k, but in this case, we easily
see from the left hand side of (4.31) that P ′′k,ℓ(π/3) ≫ k2, which is large compared to k22−ℓ/2
for ℓ large.
A similar calculation holds for ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6). In this case, the roots of the polynomial

are

(4.33)

4ℓ − 1 ± √12ℓ2 − 12ℓ + 1

2

,

which leads to the formula in (1.10). We omit the details, since it is nearly identical to the
previous case.

4.4. The exceptional extra zero on the arc. Using the same ideas as in Section 4.3, we
may produce an additional zero on the arc, when it exists.
Proposition 4.5. Suppose that L ≤ ℓ ≤ k < spj(ℓ). Then Ak,ℓ ≥ N′k,ℓ + 1.

There are only three cases where spj(ℓ) 6= ℓ, given by the conditions on the right hand

side of (1.10).

28

SARAH REITZES, POLINA VULAKH, AND MATTHEW P. YOUNG

Proof. The proof here is rather similar to that appearing in Section 4.3, in that we will
estimate the ﬁrst and second derivatives of Mk,ℓ(θ) at π/3. We begin with the claim that

(4.34)

da
dθa (Fk(θ)Fℓ(θ) − Fk+ℓ(θ))|θ=π/3 =

da
dθa Mk,ℓ(θ)|θ=π/3 + O(ka2−ℓ/2),

for a = 1, 2. This is similar to, yet even easier than, (4.28), since the use of the chain rule is
simpler since Gk(z) is holomorphic (also one should recall Fk(θ) = Gk(eiθ)).

First, suppose that k ≡ 0 (mod 6) and ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6), whence j ∈ {2, 8}. In this case,
3 ) = 0. By a tedious

there is a single zero of ∆k,ℓ at eiπ/3, and correspondingly we have Mk,ℓ( π
but direct calculation, we have

(4.35)

M′k,ℓ( π

3 ) = √3(−k + 2ℓ),

provided j = 2. If j = 8, the sign here is reversed. For j = 2, the nearest sample point to
π/3 had m = 2n + 1, whence Mk,ℓ(θ2n+1) < 0, while for j = 8, the sign here is switched.
Thus, if k < 2ℓ, that is, k < sp2(ℓ), then M′k,ℓ( π
3 ) > 0. By similar reasoning to that occuring
in Section 4.3, one can show that d
dθ (Fk(θ)Fℓ(θ) − Fk+ℓ(θ))|θ=π/3 > 0, at least, provided ℓ is
suﬃciently large. This provides the desired additional zero. The same argument works for
j = 8 with signs reversed.

Next assume that ℓ ≡ 0 (mod 6) and k ≡ 2 (mod 6), or k ≡ ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6). In these

cases, there is a double zero at π/3, and we have

(4.36) M′′k,ℓ( π

M′′k,ℓ( π

6 )].

If j = 8, the sign is switched. As in the previous case, the nearest sample point has a
negative value of Mk,ℓ, so if M′′k,ℓ > 0 this will produce an extra zero (provided the error term
is negligible of course). Up to a factor −2, this formula agrees with (4.30), so this provides
the desired additional zero for ℓ large.

Simplifying (4.36) in the case k ≡ ℓ ≡ 4 (mod 6), and with j = 0, we obtain

(4.38)

M′′k,ℓ( π

3 ) = −k2 + k(4ℓ − 1) − ℓ2 − ℓ.

Again, when j = 6, the sign here is switched, and again we obtain the same polynomial as
in (4.30), up to a factor −2. This provides the desired additional zero.
