ABSTRACT

Network science plays an increasingly important role to model complex data in many scientiﬁc disciplines. One
notable feature of network organization is community structure, which refers to clusters of tightly interconnected
nodes. A prominent problem is how to investigate the relationship between macro-scale modules that are retrieved
by optimizing global network measures, and micro-scale structure that are deﬁned by speciﬁc queries of the analysis
(e.g., nodal features). By generalizing fundamental concepts of joint space-frequency localization to network theory,
here we propose a ﬂexible framework to study interactions between micro- and macro-structure. Similar to pointing
and focusing a magnifying glass, the analysis can be directed to speciﬁc micro-scale structure, while the degree
of interaction with the macro-scale community structure can be seamlessly controlled. In addition, the method is
computationally efﬁcient as a result of the underlying low-dimensional optimization problem.

Introduction
Many scientiﬁc disciplines increasingly rely upon network modeling. Insights into basic network organization are
often driven by clustering and modularity; i.e., grouping of nodes derived from their within and between cluster
connectivity. To reveal such structure, spectral methods constitute an important class of approaches based on the
eigendecomposition of graph matrices such a the graph Laplacian or modularity matrix. From an optimization
viewpoint, they provide elegant solutions to the convex relaxation of different clustering formulations. However,
the eigenvectors that serve for such solutions are global in nature, which means they are localized in the spectral
domain, but not in the original graph domain, in accordance with Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

We provide a fundamental contribution to network theory by introducing the notion of localization, which will
identify micro-scale structure, to spectral graph analysis. Our proposal is based on a generalization to graphs of
the concept of Slepian functions that form a basis of band-limited functions on classical Cartesian domains with
optimal energy concentration in a pre-deﬁned interval.1, 2 These functions allow exploring the trade-off of joint
spatio-spectral localization as both the bandwidth and the interval can be chosen. Slepian functions have been
adapted to the sphere in the context of geophysics.3 Here we developed a new framework that generalizes Slepian
functions to graphs and has the ability to analyze interactions between local and global graph structure; e.g., how
selected nodes interact with macro-scale communities. We start by elaborating the framework when the spectrum is
derived from the graph Laplacian, which allows establishing the link with harmonic analysis and classical Slepian
functions. Then, we extend the framework for the modularity spectrum, which leads to useful applications for
network analysis.

Results
Networks are characterized by the adjacency matrix A, where the elements Ai, j indicate the weight of the connection
between nodes i, j = 1, . . . ,N. The graph Laplacian is deﬁned as L = D− A, where D is the diagonal degree matrix

with elements Di,i = ∑ j Ai, j. We assume undirected graphs for which A is symmetric and the graph Laplacian can
be deﬁned with different normalizations.4 The proposed framework can be applied to any form of the Laplacian
that is most relevant for the application at hand. The eigenvectors uk of L satisfy Luk = λkuk with eigenvalues
λ1 = 0 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λN; the eigenvectors play the role of basis vectors of the graph spectrum, and the associated
eigenvalues of frequencies.4 As an illustration, in Fig. 1-A, the ﬁrst eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian of the
“Swiss roll’ dataset are represented. These graph signals correspond to our intuition about slow variations along the
main axes of the stretched and rolled ribbon on which the nodes are deﬁned.

[Figure 1 about here.]

To generalize Slepian functions to graphs, ﬁrst, we introduce the notion of “bandlimiting” the graph spectrum;
i.e., we restrict the spectrum to the eigenvectors with the W < N smallest eigenvalues and group them in the matrix
UW of size N ×W . Recent work5 has demonstrated that the span of these ﬁrst W eigenvectors achieves a lower
bound for the product of signals spread in the graph and the spectral domains. Second, we deﬁne a subgraph S
that contains the S nodes in which we want the energy concentration to be maximal. The selection of the nodes in
S can be represented by a diagonal matrix S where the elements Si,i = 0/1 indicate the presence of a node i in
S . Finding the linear combination of eigenvectors UW v within the bandlimit W and with maximal energy in S
reverts to optimizing the Rayleigh quotient vT Cv/vT v, where C = UT
W SUW is the concentration matrix. Finding
the optimal vector v translates into an eigendecomposition problem, Cvk = µkvk, where µk represents the energy
concentration of the Slepian vector sk = UW vk in S . The Slepian vectors are orthonormal over the whole graph as
well as orthogonal over the subgraph S (See Methods). By convention, they are sorted according to decreasing
energy concentration 1 > µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . > 0 in S . We illustrate the procedure on the “Swiss roll” in Fig. 1-B. The
subgraph S contains the nodes within the black contour. The bandwidth ratio W /N is limited to 1%. The ﬁrst three
Slepian vectors are highly concentrated in the subgraph and build up a localized spectral decomposition; i.e., the
underlying Laplace eigenvectors UW pass on their spectral properties to the Slepian vectors. The embedding in
Fig. 1-C plots all nodes according to the second and third Slepian vectors and colors them according to the ﬁrst
one. In this view, nodes well inside the subgraph S are represented at the outside of the embedding and organized
according to orientation, while nodes not part of the subgraph are pulled towards the center. The Shannon number
K = W S/N indicates the number of Slepian vectors that are strongly concentrated in S . This trade-off is illustrated
in Fig. 1-D and an example of the effect on the ﬁrst Slepian vector in Fig. 4. For more irregular networks than the
Swiss roll, the Shannon number for a ﬁxed subgraph S becomes dependent on the topology of the network, but it
can be derived empirically from the phase-transition that occurs in the sequence µk, k = 1, . . . ,W . The interesting
regime for the bandwidth is where the transition between macro-scale and micro-scale organization occurs and
interactions can be made visible.

Spectral graph theory relates to the classical graph cut problem that consists of partitioning the graph into clusters
of nodes such that the cut size is minimized; i.e., the total weight of the edges that run between clusters. Depending
on the chosen normalization of the Laplacian, the deﬁnition of the cut size varies with respect to the original
4 ∑i, j Ai, j(1− gig j) =
network speciﬁcation. For two clusters indicated by gi = ±1, the cut size is deﬁned as R = 1
1
4 ∑i, j Li, jgig j. Finding clusters that minimize R is NP hard, but can be relaxed by allowing gi to take any real
value, which can then be solved by taking the eigenvector of the Laplacian with the second-smallest eigenvalue, the
Fiedler vector.6 The Fiedler vector can be thresholded, but, in many practical cases, additional vectors are taken into
account for multi-class clustering and to enable discovery of richer network structure.7 The ﬁrst eigenvectors can
also be used as an effective way to reduce dimensionality and visualize the network in a low-dimensional space
with topological relevance. From this perspective, the Slepian vectors solve the graph cut problem using the W
most important eigenvectors with maximal energy concentration in the subgraph S . Computationally, the ﬁrst
W eigenvectors of the Laplacian can be obtained using efﬁcient iterative numerical procedures,8 followed by the
determination of the Slepian vectors that requires the solution of only a low-dimensional eigendecomposition (i.e.,
the concentration matrix C is only of size W ×W ).

This insight permits to extend the graph Slepian framework to other spectral approaches, in particular, for
modularity analysis.9 Communities are clusters of nodes that are more strongly interconnected between them than
with other communities. For two communities indicated by gi = ±1, the main concept is to deﬁne the modularity
function Q = ∑i, j(Ai, j − Pi, j)gig j, where Pi, j = Di,iD j, j/∑i, j Di, j represents the expected weight of an edge between
nodes i and j.10 The spectral method for community detection then forms the modularity matrix B = A− P and
solves the eigendecomposition Buk = λkuk. Community structure can be derived from the eigenvectors with largest
positive eigenvalues. Similar as for the graph Laplacian, the modularity spectrum can be bandlimited by considering
W < N eigenvectors and building the concentration matrix C for a given subgraph. We analyzed data taken from
the OpenFlights Airports Database with 3’281 airports and 67’202 routes, illustrated in Fig. 2-A where airports
are colored according to continents. In Fig. 2-B, community structure revealed by the ﬁrst two eigenvectors of B
shows three different branches along which airports in North America, Europe, and Asia are arranged, respectively.
The airports that are most densely connected within their community are at the end of the branches; e.g., Atlanta
(ATL) and Barcelona (BCN). Airports that serve as the largest connector hubs for inter-continental ﬂights stand out
between the branches; e.g., London Heathrow (LHR) and New York (JFK) between North America and Europe,
Tokyo (NRT) and Honolulu (HNL) between North America and Asia, and Singapore (SIN), Bangkok (BKK),
Kuala Lumpur (KUL) between Asia and Europe. The global community structure of airline routes can be further
explored by taken into account additional eigenvectors (see Fig. 5), but it is mostly explained by continents, which
is consistent with previous reports.11

We then wanted to investigate more subtle interactions between selected airports and this macro-scale community
structure. We deﬁned the subgraph S containing all European airports (662 nodes) and embed the nodes in a new
topological space deﬁned by the coordinates of the two ﬁrst Slepian vectors. The bandwidth W provides a tuning
parameter for the trade-off between local (within the subgraph) and global community structure. Speciﬁcally, for
low bandwidth, this view is identical to the global community structure from Fig. 2-B. For high bandwidth, the
European branch opens up and the intra-European structure is revealed. For instance, in Fig. 2-C, we identify
at bandwidth W = 80 three major branches along which North, West, and East European airports are organized,
respectively. Similar to the interpretation of Fig. 1-C, the nodes that are farthest from the center are most interior
to the communities. To better illustrate this observation, in Fig. 2-D, the nodes are mapped to their geographical
position and the angle and magnitude with respect to the center in the Slepian view is used to determine their color
and size, respectively.

Next, we wanted to study interactions of the African airports (288 nodes), which remain invisible in the global
view of Fig. 2-B. In Fig. 2-E, we ﬁrst show a low-bandwidth view (W = 20) where mainly two branches of African
airports form. Interestingly, presence of some non-African airports is prominent; e.g., Paris (CDG) with many routes
to airports in the Maghreb including Casa Blanca (CMN), Tunis (TUN), and Algiers (ALG); and Brussels (BRU)
with historical routes to West Africa including Abidjan (ABJ), and Dakar (DKR), Ouagadougou (OUA). When
increasing the bandwidth (W = 80), three branches can be distinguished that further conﬁrm modular organization
of the African routes within West Africa, Central and South Africa (e.g., Johannesburg (JNB)), and East Africa (e.g.,
Nairobi (NBO))—see Fig. 2-F for the geographical embedding that conﬁrms this interpretation. The organization of
the North African airports is less pronounced because they interconnect much denser to the European continent
and, therefore, take a more central position in the Slepian view. In Fig. 7, the effect of progressively increasing the
bandwidth is illustrated in detail.

The framework can be pushed to its extreme by including a single node in the subgraph. In Fig. 3, the embedding
provided by the ﬁrst two Slepian vectors for the subgraph S that only includes a single node (i.e., Istanbul Atat¨urk
(IST)) is shown. Even for relatively low bandwidth (W = 30), the result in Fig. 3 shows how other Turkish airports
such as Ankara (ESB) and ADB (Izmir) interact closely with IST, but also Tehran (IKA) for which IST is one of the
main gateways. Interestingly, Istanbul’s other international airport, Sabiha G¨okc¸en (SAW), is topologically closest
to IST despite the lack of a direct route between IST and SAW.

Discussion
In sum, the proposed framework provides a novel way to put a magnifying glass on network organization and
study interactions between micro- and macro-structure. The selection of the micro-structure can be compared to
where to direct the magnifying glass, while tuning the bandwidth to the degree of focus on the selection. Due to the
underlying low-dimensional optimization problem, the method is computationally efﬁcient and allows for a versatile
and interactive exploration of the network properties. We expect this framework to serve further methodological
developments in this active ﬁeld.12, 13 For instance, the discovery of hierarchical structure14–18 could beneﬁt from
a gradual reﬁnement of the subgraph deﬁnition while using the same underlying global eigenvectors. Spectral
approaches also play a central role in recent multi-resolution approaches,19–21 for which the Slepian vectors could
become localized basis functions to design graph wavelets. Finally, the notion of the subgraph selection could also
be extended to include layers, as in multiplex networks,22 and to be speciﬁed in terms of links instead of nodes, as
in link communities.23, 24

Methods
The core of the framework consists of solving the eigendecomposition of the concentration matrix C = UT
W SUW ,
where S is the selection matrix of the subgraph S and UW contains the W ﬁrst smallest or largest eigenvectors of
the graph Laplacian or modularity matrix, respectively. This leads to the eigenvectors and eigenvalues that satisfy
Cvk = µkvk, k = 1, . . . ,W . The eigenvalues µk represent the energy concentration in S of the Slepian vectors
sk = UW vk that are a linear combination of the original eigenvectors uk, k = 1, . . . ,W . By convention, the Slepian
vectors are sorted according to decreasing energy concentration as 1 > µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ . . . ≥ µW > 0. The sequence of
eigenvalues µk presents a phase transition between well-localized and poorly-localized eigenvectors. In the classical
case, this phase transition occurs at the Shannon number K = W S/N. We observed that K still provides a good
rule-of-thumb for the number of Slepian vectors with high energy concentration, but in general it can be derived
empirically from the sequence µk itself.

The Slepian vectors sk, k = 1, . . . ,W , satisfy various remarkable properties similar to their classical counterparts.
For instance, since they are derived using two eigendecompositions in cascade, they are orthonormal over the whole
network, as well as orthogonal over the subgraph S . This can be readily shown as

Swiss Roll
The “Swiss roll” dataset was generated using the code available from25 that embeds nodes with randomly generated
positions (uniformly in a unit square) into a ribbon that was stretched and rolled in three dimensions. The number
of nodes was set to N = 4(cid:48)400. The Euclidean distances di, j between all pairs of nodes (i, j) were computed and
converted into a weighted adjacency matrix by the kernel operation Ai, j = exp(−d2
i, j/0.005). Weights smaller
than 0.01 were put to zero (which corresponds to distances larger than 0.15). To determine the subgraph S ,
we selected the node that was most to the left and in the middle of the roll. We selected all neighboring nodes
within a distance 0.8, which corresponded to 762 nodes. We then determined the normalized graph Laplacian
L = D−1/2(D− A)D−1/2.

[Figure 4 about here.]

The sequence of eigenvalues µk, k = 1, . . . ,W , is shown in Fig. 4-A for W varying between 2 and 130. The
dashed line indicates the Shannon number K that provides a good estimate of the phase transition in µk. The
computation time (Apple MacBook Pro, 2.6GHz i7/16GB RAM, running Matlab R2014b) was 0.4 seconds to obtain

4/7

the 130 eigenvectors UW of L with smallest eigenvalues. The second eigendecomposition to retrieve the Slepian
function took less than 0.02 seconds.

In Fig. 4-B, the ﬁrst Slepian vector is visualized in its 3-D space for increasing bandwidth. For higher bandwidth,
the energy concentration in the selected subgraph becomes stronger. For the illustration in the main text, we set the
bandwidth to W = 44 or 1% in relative terms.

OpenFlights Airports Database
We imported the OpenFlights Airports Database from May 20, 2015. Airports without any routes were removed;
which resulted in 3(cid:48)281 airports. The undirected weighted adjacency matrix was built as the number of routes
between each pair of airports independent of the direction. In total, 67(cid:48)202 routes were taken into account. The
adjacency matrix is stored as a sparse matrix with 38(cid:48)047 non-zero entries. We used the modularity matrix B with
the Girvan-Newman null model. This matrix is evaluated by an inline-function to take full beneﬁt of its sparse
structure. The computation of the W eigenvectors UW of B with largest eigenvalues took 0.5 seconds. The second
eigendecomposition to retrieve the Slepian vectors took less than 0.01 seconds for all subgraphs and maximal
bandwidth (W = 100).

[Figure 5 about here.]

[Figure 6 about here.]

In Fig. 5, we show the macro-scale community structure revealed by the ﬁrst 6 eigenvectors of the modularity
matrix. The ﬁrst view given by (u1,u2) shows three branches along which airports in the American, European,
and Asian continent are arranged. The second and third views by (u3,u4) and (u5,u6) show additional reﬁnements
to this organization, but they become increasingly difﬁcult to interpret visually, mainly due to the orthogonality
constraints of the eigenvectors uk. The Slepian framework will use W eigenvectors to ‘refocus’ onto a predeﬁned
subgraph S .

In Fig. 6, we show the Slepian spectrum (i.e., sequence of eigenvalues µk, k = 1, . . . ,W ) depending on W for
various choices of the subgraph S : Europe (662 nodes), Africa (288 nodes), Istanbul Atat¨urk (1 node). The black
dashed line indicates the Shannon number, which still provides a good rule of thumb despite the more irregular
structure of the network.

[Figure 7 about here.]

In Fig. 7, we show the visualization based on the ﬁrst two Slepian vectors when the subgraph contains all
African airports and the bandwidth W is gradually increased from 10 to 80. For W = 10, a branch with African
airports appears while the European and Asian branches from the macro-scale view are still present. For W = 20,
more diversity in the intra-African organization is present, including European airports that play a central role (e.g.,
Brussels (BRU)). For W = 40 and W = 80 the within-Africa community structure is further conﬁrmed by several
branches and the central hubs of each community taking a place at the ends of these branches.

Upon acceptance of this manuscript, the source code (Matlab) and experimental data will be made available to

the community. In addition, we are developing a Gephi plugin (Java) for interactive visualization.
