Our aim is to unveil how resonances of parametric systems are aﬀected when symmetry is broken.
We showed numerically and experimentally that odd resonances, not typically observed for a verti-
cally excited pendulum, indeed come about when the pendulum is excited along a tilted direction.
Applying the Melnikov method, we have not only determined analytically the loci of saddle-node bi-
furcations delimiting resonance regions in parameter space, but also explained these observations by
demonstrating that odd resonances arise due to an extra torque that appears in the nonsymmetric
case.

INTRODUCTION

Resonance is an ubiquitous phenomenon. It provides an ideal landscape for the eﬃcient functioning of many natural
and technological systems, such as the ampliﬁcation of our speech by the cavities in our body [1], the motion of a
child on a swing [2], imaging by magnetic resonance, signal ampliﬁcation [3–5], and energy harvesting from mechanical
oscillatory motion. The parametric pendulum, described by

¨θ + β ˙θ + (1 + P cos Ωpt) sin θ = 0,

(1)

is a paradigmatic model in nonlinear dynamics [6–8]. It consists of a planar simple pendulum whose pivot oscillates
harmonically along the vertical direction with amplitude P and frequency Ωp, and β is the friction parameter. This
system has attracted great attention [9–14]. It presents a wide range of dynamical behaviour, such as: the stabilization
of the hilltop saddle [15–20]; the occurrence of chaotic behaviour [21–26]; the observation of period-doubling cascades
[27, 28] and the existence of resonance regions [8, 29]. Moreover, it can be used as qualitative analogue for more
complex systems [28, 30, 31].
Indeed, mechanical analogues of physical systems provide a direct visualization of
motion allowing an intuitive understanding of the system being studied, as it is done for the analysis of power grid
[32] and applications of telecommunications [33]. Rotating motion in the parametric pendulum has also been widely
considered in the literature [34], due to the possibility of energy harvesting from sea waves, which would consist in
transforming the vertical motion of sea waves in rotating motion of systems composed by parametric pendula [35–39].
The study of stable periodic orbits of Eq. (1) has a long academic history, in particular regarding those whose
period is an even or odd multiple of the excitation period [40]. Previous works show the existence of both even [41, 42]
and odd [28, 43, 44] oscillations in the frequency region Ωp < 2. Odd resonances however are very rarely reported,
supposedly due to its non-typical nature (observed for only small ranges of parameters) [43]. To describe theoretically
the mechanisms that could lead to subharmonic solutions, Koch and Leven [45] applied the Melnikov theorem for
subharmonic bifurcations [46, 47] to this system. They succeeded in calculating parameter ranges for the existence
of even oscillations, but concluded that the Melnikov theorem could not be applied to unravel parameter ranges for
odd oscillations. This is also true when Melnikov method is applied to other similar parametric systems [48–50]. In
Ref. [51], it is shown that for nonlinear perturbed systems, even oscillations are due to parametric excitation along
the gravity ﬁeld, while odd oscillations can exist as consequence of external torques. Looking at Eq. (1), one notices
that this system is symmetric with respect to the transformation θ → −θ. External torques are absent. However,
breaking the symmetry of Eq. (1) by a tilt in the pendulum pivot motion should introduce an additional torque in the
equations of motion, as we shall see. A question then arises: does symmetry breaking aﬀect somehow the behavior of
odd oscillations?

We have demonstrated numerically and experimentally, for the tilted parametric pendulum, the existence of odd
resonances in the frequency region Ωp > 2, that are not observed in the vertical case. Also, applying the Melnikov
method, we obtained analytically the loci of saddle-node bifurcations that are the parameter thresholds for the
existence of odd stable oscillations. Surprisingly, these loci coincide with the curves that limit resonance regions
numerically found. Moreover, we show that whereas even resonances are a consequence of the vertical excitation, odd
ones comes about due to the tilt in the orientation of the excitation with respect to the vertical position. This work
therefore paves the way to a better understanding of how resonances of any type can appear in complex oscillating
systems and how they can be related to symmetry.

II. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

A diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. The pendulum consists of a single arm with mass
m and center of mass position at a distance l from the pivot axis. The natural frequency of oscillation is f0 and the
friction parameter is b [52]. The angle between the pendulum arm and the vertical direction is θ. The pivot of the
pendulum is attached to a sliding car, which is periodically excited according to s = A cos ωpt, along a tilted axis
making an angle φ = π/8 with the vertical direction. To measure the absolute value of the pivot velocity vp = | ˙s|, we
attached a linear optical encoder, of resolution 2.54
500 cm, to the sliding car. From the time series vp(t), we can obtain
the frequency fp = 2πωp and the amplitude A of the external excitation, which are the control parameters of the
system.

FIG. 1: Diagram of the experimental apparatus of a planar simple pendulum parametrically excited along an arbitrary direction.
The pendulum pivot axis is attached to a sliding car that is forced to oscillate with amplitude A and frequency fp, with the
help of a crank and a servo motor. We can measure simultaneously the absolute value of the pivot speed vp, with a linear
encoder system in the lab reference frame, and the absolute value of the pendulum angular velocity |ω|, with a rotary encoder
system attached to the pendulum.

To measure the absolute value of the angular velocity ω = ˙θ of the pendulum arm, we attached an optical rotary
encoder, of resolution 2π
2500 rad, to the pendulum arm, concentric to the pivot point. The light sensor of the rotary
encoder is attached to the sliding car, concentrically to the pivot, while the sensor of the linear encoder is attached
to the lab reference frame. The induced inputs from both encoders were detected by using an ADC board of 16 bits
at the rate of 200 Ksamples/s. For ﬁxed values of A, the excitation frequency fp was spanned in the forward and
backward directions with a servo motor in steps of 0.01Hz. The periodicity of each trajectory, both in numerical and
experimental analyses, was computed from the stroboscopic map for the absolute value of the angular velocity of the
pendulum |ω[(k + 1)Tp]| × |ω(kTp)|, k ∈ N (see Fig. 4).

III. EQUATIONS OF MOTION

The equations of motion of the undamped parametric pendulum can be obtained via Lagrangian formulation.

Adding a linear damping term −b ˙θ, we arrive at

˙θ = ω,
˙ω = − sin θ − [P cos(Ωp¯t) sin(θ − φ) + βω] ,

where the dot indicates derivative with respect to the normalized time ¯t = ω0t, and

Ωp =

are the dimensionless parameters of the system. The period of the perturbation is Tp = 2π/Ωp. Notice the symmetry
θ → −θ is lost, and comparing with Eq. (1) we have an extra torque τ = P sin φ cos (Ωp¯t) cos θ for φ 6= 0.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We computed numerically the parameter spaces in the vertical and tilted cases to search for resonance regions. For
each pair (Ωp, P ), we integrated Eqs. (2) for a time span ¯t = 1000, with ﬁxed initial conditions θi = 0.55 and ωi = 0.
Transient behaviour was dealt with by disregarding initial data up to ¯t = 900 of each time series. Results are shown
in Fig. 2.

FIG. 2: Parameter spaces for: (a) vertical (φ = 0); and (b) tilted (φ = π/8) excitations. FP denotes ﬁxed point; Pn and
Rn, period-n [40] oscillation and rotation, respectively; IO periodic inverted oscillations, and CH persistent tumbling chaos
[24]. Full black lines represent the loci of saddle-node (SN), pitchfork (PK) and period-doubling (PD) bifurcations, and were
obtained with the software AUTO 07p [53, 54]. In the vertical case we observed only even resonances, and in tilted case, both
even and odd resonances.

In Fig. 2(a), we display the parameter space for the vertical excitation case. Notice that oﬀ the resonance regions,
the pendulum does not oscillate, but stays at the ﬁxed point (FP) θ = ω = 0. From the right to the left, full line
SN4 is the loci of saddle-node bifurcations for which a period-4 stable oscillations (P4) come about, and full line
PK is the loci of pitchfork bifurcations at which stable period-2 (P2) oscillations appear. Then we have period-1
(R1) and period-2 (R2) rotations, and persistent tumbling chaos (CH). In Fig. 2(b) we have the parameter space for

4

the non-symmetric perturbation case. Regions P1 represent parameters generating non ressonant regions, when the
pendulum oscillates with the same period of the perturbation. From the right to the left, we see with the full lines
SN4, SN3 and SN5/2, respectively, the loci of saddle-node bifurcations from which period-4 (P4), period-3 (P3) and
period-5/2 stable oscillations come about. Full line PD is the loci of period-doubling bifurcations in which the period-1
oscillations lose stability and stable period-2 resonant stable oscillations (P2) appear. We observe period-1 (R1) and
period-2 (R2) rotations, and then persistent tumbling chaos (CH). Multistability is present for some parameter values,
but since the integration has only been performed for a single initial condition, this can not be seen here.

Also for the parametrically excited double pendulum it is true that regions of nonoscillation and the pitchfork
bifurcations that appear in the vertical case are substituted for regions of period-1 oscillations and period-doubling
bifurcation, respectively, in the tilted case [55, 56], as a consequence of the extra torque due to the symmetry breaking.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

2 = 0.8Hz, we have a bifurcation at which it oscillates with period Tp

In Fig. 3(a) the experimental bifurcation diagram for the tilted case is shown. The amplitude of excitation is
A = 2.02 cm and we performed both forward and backward frequency sweeps. The occurence of odd primary
resonaces P1, P3 and P5 for large parameter ranges is remarkable. In Fig. 3(b) we have the equivalent bifurcation
diagram computed numerically, and comparison of both results display great agreement. Along the line with empty
circles (increasing fp), from the left to the right, the pendulum starts realizing small oscillations with the same period
and phase of the excitation. At fp = f0
2 and out
of phase with perturbation. Another bifurcation happens at around fp = f0 = 1.61Hz, causing it to oscillate with the
same period of the perturbation, but diﬀerent phase. For larger frequencies, at around fp = 2Hz, the pendulum slowly
gets in phase with the excitation. For around fp = 2.8Hz non regular motion is observed and we needed to prevent
the pendulum from rotating, because the energy gain is so large that it can destroy the apparatus [55]. Around
fp = 2f0 = 3.22Hz it oscillates with twice the period of the excitation, and for a slight increase in the frequency it
goes back to oscillating with the same period and phase of the perturbation until the end of the data acquisition.
Following the full line (decreasing fp), we observe basically the same phenomena, except for when there is hysteresis.
In this process, we observe no oscillation with period higher than 2Tp, but this is because in the frequency region
where we expect to observe those solutions, the pendulum is oscillating in the regime of small oscillations, outside the
basins of attraction of these long-period attractors.

FIG. 3: Bifurcation diagrams at A = 2.02 cm obtained (a) experimentally and (b) numerically. Frequency of the excitation
was spanned both forward (line with empty circles) and backwards (full line). Periodic oscillations P3, P4 and P5 are excited
by manually setting up initial conditions of the pendulum, and are displayed in triangles, squares and stars, respectively, for
forward frequency sweeping, and in full lines for backward sweeping.

To detect those solutions, we need to manually adjust the initial conditions of the pendulum in the parameter region
we expect to observe them. If we adjust θ0 ≈ 0.5 in the region fp ≈ 3f0 = 4.83 Hz we ﬁnd the period-3 resonant
oscillatory attractor P3. The triangles represent those solutions with increasing frequency, and the full line above
them, the same solutions with decreasing frequency. Also, if we adjust θ0 ≈ 0.36 in the region fp ≈ 4f0 = 6.44 Hz,

we ﬁnd the period-4 oscillatory attractor P4. The squares represent those solutions with increasing frequency and, as
before, the full line above them, the same solutions with decreasing frequency. We also found period-5 oscillations we
did not foresee numerically from Fig. 2, because the initial conditions we chose were out of its basin of attraction.
If we adjust θ0 ≈ 0.9 in the region fp ≈ 5f0 = 8.05 Hz we will ﬁnd attractor P5, which is represented by stars in
the case of increasing frequency, and by a full line above them in the case of decreasing frequency.
In Fig. 3(a)
all full lines represent pendulum behavior that for a decreasing frequency go into rotating motion, resulting in an
abrupt increase in |ω|. In Fig.3(b) this is not always the case; for P5, at fp = 7.7 Hz it ends up going back to period-1
oscillations. This diﬀerence can be explained by the coexistence of periodic rotations and oscillations. The coexistence
of period-1, period-4 and period-5 oscillatory attractors in the small range 7.8 < fp < 8.05 Hz is noteworthy. In Fig.
4, sampled experimental time series for period-2, 3, 4 and 5 oscillations are displayed to illustrate the construction of
the stroboscopic maps.

VI. THEORETICAL RESULTS

Parameter thresholds for the occurrence of resonant periodic oscillations are derived by applying the Melnikov
method for subharmonic solutions. The planar simple pendulum is described by the (Hamiltonian) vector ﬁeld
f (θ, ω) = [ω − sin (θ)]⊺. The phase space has a pair of homoclinic orbits bi-asymptotic to the saddle points (θ, ω) =
(±π, 0), and their interior is ﬁlled by a continuous family of periodic oscillations qα(t) = (θα(t), ωα(t)), with α being
a label, described by

cos(cid:18) θα

2 (cid:19) = ksn(t, k),
ωα = ˙θα = 2kcn(t, k)

sin(cid:18) θα

2 (cid:19) = dn(t, k),

(4)

6

where sn(t, k), cn(t, k) and dn(t, k) are the Jacobi elliptic functions and k ∈ [0, 1] is the elliptic modulus. The period of
these solutions is Tα = 4K(k), where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of ﬁrst kind. Now, perturb this system with
the time-dependent and periodic (of period Tp = 2π/Ωp) vector ﬁeld g(θ, ω, P, Ωp, β) = [0 −ǫP cos (Ωpτ ) sin (θ − φ)−
βω]⊺, with 0 < ǫ ≪ 1, and consider the quantity

M m(t0) = Z mTp

−ωα(t) [P cos Ωpt sin (θα − φ) − βωα] dt,

(5)

which is a path integral computed along the periodic oscillation qα(t) of period Tα = mTp, that is, a solution satisfying
the resonance condition

4K(k) = m

.

(6)

Theorem 4.6.2 of [46] states that if M m(t0) has simple zeros, meaning M m/n(t0) = 0, but ∂M
(t0) 6= 0, then the
perturbed system has a solution that is a periodic subharmonic oscillation of period mTp, arising from a saddle-node
bifurcation.

m/n

Substituting Eqs. (4), subject to the resonance condition (6), into Eq. (5), we have

M m(t0) = −4k2βI1 − 4k2P cos φI2 + 2kP sin φI3 − 4k3P sin φI4,

cos[Ωp(t + t0)]cn(t, k)sn2(t, k)dt.

Imposing M m(t0) has simple zeros we obtain the loci of the saddle-node bifurcations generating a subharmonic
ressonant periodic orbit, i.e., the minimum values Rm such that for P > Rm we might observe stable oscillatory
motion of period mTp in the parameter space.

If m is even, I3 = I4 = 0, and M m(t0) can only have simple zeros if I2, that comes from the vertical excitation

component, is non identically null. In this case, Rm

even, is given by

where k′2 = 1 − k2 is the complementary elliptic modulus and K ′(k) = K(k′). On the other hand, if m is odd, I2 = 0,
and M m(t0) can only have simple zeros if I3 or/and I4, which are both due to the additional torque τ caused by the
tilt in the pivot motion, are non identically null. Then, Rm

with a+(l) = 2l + 1 + m, a−(l) = 2l + 1 − m and b(l) = 2l + 1. The elliptic modulus k is determined from Ωp through
the resonance condition, and it is worth noticing that for Ωp > m there is no k such that Eq. (6) is satisﬁed. It is
remarkable that for the vertically excited pendulum we have sin φ = 0, and no Melnikov condition for the existence
of odd oscillations can be determined, that is, M m(t0) does not have simple zeros in this case.

In Fig. 5 we see remarkable agreement between numeric and analytic predictions for the loci of the saddle-node
bifurcations where the oscillatory resonant stable periodic attractors P3 and P4 appear in the region P < 0.5. Full

VII. DISCUSSION

In conclusion, the novelty was to show that odd resonant oscillations are likely to be observed in the tilted parametric
pendulum, enlarging the spectra of possible resonances in the system. From numerical simulations, comparison
of parameter spaces revealed that odd primary resonance tongues, with vertices in nf0, n = 1, 3, 5, that are not
observed in the symmetric system, indeed come about in the asymmetric case. These resonances were outstandingly
demonstrated experimentally. Finally, the occurence of odd resonances when excitation is along a tilted direction was
explained by the Melnikov method for subharmonic solutions. We not only demonstrated that the loci of saddle-node
bifurcations that is the threshold obtained by application of this method excellently agrees with those computed using
numeric continuation technique, what implies that primary resonances are indeed described by this method, but also
showed that whereas even resonances are due to the vertical excitation component, odd resonances are a result of
an extra torque that appears only in the tilted case, as a consequence of the symmetry breaking of the equations of
motion.

[48] When the Melnikov method is applied to the vertically excited parametric pendulum, and also to other similar parametric
systems, such as the parametric pendulum subject to non-harmonic excitation [49] and the pendulum with varying length
[50], integrating Eq. (5), we see that the term that can lead to non simple zeros of the Melnikov integral is non identically
null only for even oscillations. Thus, the parameter thresholds for the existence for odd oscillations cannot be computed,
at least through this method.
