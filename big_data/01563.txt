Abstract

The equivalence between theories depending on the derivatives of R, i.e. f (R, ∇R, ..., ∇nR), and
scalar-tensorial theories is veriﬁed. The analysis is done in both metric and Palatini formalisms. It is
shown that f (R, ∇R, ..., ∇nR) theories are equivalents to Brans-Dicke theories with kinetic terms ω0 = 0
and ω0 = − 3
2 for metric and Palatini formalisms respectively. This result is analogous to what happens
for f (R) theories. Furthermore, suﬃcient conditions are established for f (R, ∇R, ..., ∇nR) theories
to be written as scalar-tensorial theories. Finally, some examples are studied and the comparison of
f (R, ∇R, ..., ∇nR) theories to f (R, (cid:3)R, ...(cid:3)nR) theories are performed.

Introduction

Alternative scenarios for the standard theory of gravitation have long been proposed in order to circumvent
several problems presented by General Relativity (renormalization [1, 2], inﬂation [3, 4], the present day
accelerated expansion of the universe [5, 6], and so on). As examples of these proposals, one can cite
quadratic Lagrangians on the Riemann tensor theories [7, 8], the Horava–Lifshitz model [9], braneworld
models [10, 11, 12, 13], ΛCDM model [14, 15], etc..

Among these propositions, three are of special interest here. The ﬁrst one is f (R) theories [16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21], which were presented as an alternative scenario for the standard ΛCDM model in an attempt
to cure the cosmological constant problem [16]. f (R) gravity was also motivated as an alternative to dark
energy models.

The second class of models that we are specially concerned with in this work is the scalar-tensor theories
[22, 23, 24, 25]. In these theories, part of the gravitational interaction is described by a scalar ﬁeld. In the
original paper by Brans and Dicke [22], a scalar ﬁeld was introduced along with the metric tensor in an
attempt to implement Mach’s principle. The interest in Brans-Dicke work was renewed with string theory
[19].

An important feature of both f (R) and scalar-tensor theories lies on the fact that they can be proved
to be equivalent (at least in the classical level), i.e. a f (R) general model can be cast into the form of a
Brans-Dicke theory with a potential [26, 27].

The third category of interest here is the one of theories including derivatives of the scalar curvature
R [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. They were inspired by string theory, or motivated by quantum loop corrections,
or as alternatives to dark energy models. From the point of view of quantum gravity, terms containing
derivatives of scalar curvature (and Riemann and Ricci tensors) are necessary for the renormalizability of
the theory [33, 34, 35, 36], although these terms usually produce unphysical massive ghost [37, 38]. Theories
containing derivatives of R can be seen either as toy models, or as eﬀective theories, or even as full theories.
In any case, the question addressed in this paper is: Is there an scalar-tensorial equivalent theory for this
class of theories? As far as the authors are aware, this question has been addressed for the particular
case of f (R, (cid:3)R, ...(cid:3)nR) theories [39, 40]. Here, the interest is devoted to a more general category of
theories, namely f (R,∇µR,∇µ1∇µ2 R, ...,∇µ1 ...∇µn R) theories — henceforth written as f (R,∇R, ...,∇nR),
or simply as f (R,∇R, ...), for short-hand notation. As it shall be seen, besides the scalar ﬁeld other auxiliary
tensorial ﬁelds must be introduced. The analysis is restricted to a category of theories with regular hessian
matrix (from this point of view, f (R, (cid:3)R, ...(cid:3)nR) theories are singular) and it is performed both in the
metric and Palatini formalisms.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the equivalence of f (R,∇R, ...,∇nR) and scalar-tensorial
theories is analyzed in the metric formalism. For the sake of clarity, the section starts with the analysis of
the f (R,∇R) case and is extended in the sequence. In Section 3, the analysis is repeated in the Palatini
formalism. In Section 4, applications are performed and Section 5 is devoted to our ﬁnal remarks.

2 Metric Formalism

2.1 Second order gravity theory

Consider an action integral dependent on the scalar curvature and its ﬁrst derivative:

S =Z d4x√−g [f (R,∇R) + LM ] ,

(1)

where LM is the matter ﬁeld Lagrangian.
and R and its derivative are considered as parameters:

Let S ′ be another action integral where a scalar and a vectorial ﬁelds ξ and ξµ are the fundamental ﬁelds

S ′ =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)f (ξ, ξµ) −

∂f
∂ξ · (ξ − R) −

∂f

∂ξµ · (ξµ − ∇µR) + LM(cid:21) .

The null variations of the action and independence of the variations in ξ, ξµ lead to

∂ξν ∂ξ

∂ξν ∂ξµ !(cid:18) (ξ − R)

(ξµ − ∇µR) (cid:19) =(cid:18) 0
0 (cid:19)

∂ 2f

The new action S ′ will be equivalent to S if

This condition leads to the following ﬁeld equations

are Lagrange multipliers in S ′. This way, these quantities will be

It also becomes clear that ∂f

replaced by scalar and vectorial ﬁelds, respectively,

φ ≡
φµ ≡

,

∂f
∂ξ
∂f
∂ξµ

.

Condition Eq.(2) ensures that ξ = ξ (φ, φµ) and ξν = ξν (φ, φµ) exist.

With these quantities S ′ becomes

S ′ =Z d4x√−g [−φξ − φµξµ + f (ξ, ξµ) + φR + φµ∇µR + LM ] .

A potential U (φ, φµ) is deﬁned as

U (φ, φµ) ≡ φξ (φ, φµ) + φµξµ (φ, φµ) − f (ξ (φ, φµ) , ξµ (φ, φµ)) .

The action then reads:

S ′ =Z d4x√−g [φR + φµ∇µR − U (φ, φµ) + LM ] ,

(4)

(5)

(6)

which is the scalar-vectorial equivalent theory to S. It is clear that no kinetic terms for φ and φµ are present
in S ′.

The coupling with the gradient of the Ricci scalar can be eliminated by using the identity

and expressing S ′, up to a surface term, as

√−gφµ∇µR = ∂µ(cid:0)√−gφµR(cid:1) − √−g∇µφµR ,
S ′ =Z d4x√−g [ΦR − U (Φ, φµ,∇µφµ) + LM ] ,

where we have deﬁned a new scalar ﬁeld

and the potential

This is a Brans-Dicke like theory,

U (Φ, φµ,∇µφµ) ≡ (Φ + ∇µφµ) ξ + φµξµ − f (ξ, ξµ) .

Φ ≡ (φ − ∇µφµ) ,

SBD =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)ϕR −

ω0

(7)

(8)

(9)

with ω0 = 0 (which means that no explicit kinetic term for Φ is present) and a potential for the scalar ﬁeld,
the vector ﬁeld and its covariant divergent.

2.2 Extension to higher order gravity theories

Consider the general action dependence on the scalar curvature and its derivatives up to order n:

S =Z d4x√−g(cid:2)f(cid:0)R,∇R,∇2R, ...,∇nR(cid:1) + LM(cid:3) .

3

A new action S ′ is proposed where scalar and tensorial ﬁelds are introduced, replacing R and its deriva-
tives. In order to recast the original theory in this new formulation, Lagrange multipliers are introduced so
that the new action is

S ′ =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)f (ξ, ξµ, ξµν , ..., ξµ1...µn ) −

∂f

∂ξµ1...µn · (ξµ1...µn − ∇µ1 ...∇µn R) + LM(cid:21) .

since the condition det H 6= 0 ensures that ξ = ξ (φ, φµ, ...) , ..., ξµ1...µn = ξµ1...µn (φ, φµ, ...) exist.

U (φ, φµ, φµν , ..., φµ1...µn) = φξ + φµξµ + φµν ξµν + ... + φµ1...µn ξµ1...µn − f (ξ, ξµ, ξµν , ..., ξµ1...µn ) .

(11)

The action is then cast into the form

S ′ =Z d4x√−g [−U (φ, φµ, φµν , ..., φµ1 ...µn)
+φR + φµ∇µR + φµν∇µ∇ν R − ... + φµ1...µn∇µ1 ...∇µn R + LM ] ,

which is the scalar-tensorial equivalent theory to S. The action S ′ can be rewritten by considering that

√−gφµ1 ...µn∇µ1 ...∇µn R = √−g (−1)n ∇µn ...∇µ1 φµ1...µnR + ∂µSµ

(n).

(12)

The last term of (12) turns out to be a surface term when this equation is substituted in the action integral.
It follows, up to surface terms,

S ′ =Z d4x√−g [ΦR − U (Φ, φµ, ..., φµ1...µn,∇µφµ, ...,∇µn ...∇µ1 φµ1...µn) + LM ] ,

Φ ≡ φ − ∇µφµ + ... + (−1)n ∇µn ...∇µ1 φµ1...µn,

where

(13)

(14)

(15)

This is also a Brans-Dicke theory with ω0 = 0 and a potential. As before, no kinetic term is present for Φ
and in order to introduce it, the Palatini formalism has to be considered. This is done in the next section.
Meanwhile, the ﬁeld equations are derived.

By varying the action with respect to the independent ﬁelds gµν , Φ, φµ,..., φµ1 ,...,µn and ψ, one obtains:

3 Palatini Formalism

Now the Palatini formalism is developed. In this approach, the connection and the metric are considered as
independent ﬁelds. As a consequence, the variations of the action will be taken with respect to both Γ and
gµν. Moreover, the matter ﬁelds Lagrangian LM does not explicitly depend on the connection. This is a
necessary condition to recover GR under the particular choice f (R,∇R) = R. This condition implies that
all derivation operators present in the action are built with the Levi-Civita connection.
Before proceeding to the general Lagrangian f(cid:0)R,∇R,∇2R, ...,∇nR(cid:1), the case f (R,∇R) will be studied

for clariﬁcation of the steps to be followed when the most general case is analyzed.

3.1.2 Scalar-vectorial Theory

We start with scalar and vector ﬁelds deﬁned in the Palatini formalism:

S =Z d4x√−g [f (R,∇R) + LM ]

Proceeding exactly as in the metric approach (except that R appears instead of R) a new action S ′ is

obtained as

S ′ =Z d4x√−g [ΦR − U (Φ, φµ,∇µφµ) + LM ] ,

where, Φ ≡ (φ − ∇µφµ) and U (Φ, φµ,∇µφµ) ≡ (Φ + ∇µφµ) ξ + φµξµ − f (ξ, ξµ). If R is replaced in terms of
R, according to Eq. (33), then we get, up to a surface term:

S ′ =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)ΦR +
This is a Brans-Dicke-like action with ω0 = − 3
theories [16], where ∂f

3.2 Generalization for higher derivatives

Now the general case f (R,∇µR,∇µ1R, ...,∇µ1 ...∇µnR) = f(cid:0)R,∇R,∇2R, ...,∇nR(cid:1) will be analyzed.

3.2.1 Field equations

In this section, the previous results are generalized to Lagrangians depending on higher derivatives of the
curvature. Previously, it was checked that the comparison of f (R,∇R) theories with f (R) gravity led to
the substitution ∂f

∂f

∂R → ∂f

(39)

of confusion.

The abreviation f(cid:0)R,∇R,∇2R, ...,∇nR(cid:1) = f (R,∇R, ...) will be used from now on, where there is no risk
Variations with respect to gµν , Γ and ψ give results completely analogous to the second order case:
The equations of motion are precisely Eqs. (23), (24) and (25) provided that we generalize f ′ (R,∇R) to
f ′ (R,∇R, ...) as below:

f ′ (R,∇ρR,∇ρ1R, ...,∇ρ1 ...∇ρnR) =

∂f

∂∇ρR(cid:19)
∂R − ∇ρ(cid:18) ∂f
+ ... + (−1)n ∇ρn ...∇ρ1

∂f

∂∇ρ1 ...∇ρnR

.

(40)

Relations Eq.(31), Eq.(32) and Eq.(33) and all results obtained in Sect. 3.1.1 can be directly generalized just
by taking f ′ as the complete functional derivative — Eq.(40). Now we turn to the problem of investigating
the equivalence of the f ′ (R,∇R, ...)-gravity theories with Brans-Dicke models.

3.2.2 Scalar-tensorial Theory

If the scalar and tensorial ﬁelds and the potential U are deﬁned as in the metric approach – Eqs. (10) and
(11) – the action integral (39) takes the form

As an opposition to the metric approach, the presence of the kinetic term for Φ does not imply that this
ﬁeld carries dynamics. If one takes the trace of Eq. (42) and the resulting expression for R is replaced on

is satisﬁed as long as c0 6= 0, c1 6= 0. Under these constraints, the theory from action (47) is non-singular.
Starobinski-Podolsky action could be made equivalent to a theory of the type f (R, (cid:3)R) up to a surface term
after an integration by parts; however, the resulting f (R, (cid:3)R)-theory would be singular.

4.1 Metric formalism

The tensorial ﬁelds φ, φµ are

and the potential U is given by

( φ ≡ ∂f
φµ ≡ ∂f

∂ξµ

∂ξ = (1 + c0ξ) ⇒ ξ = (φ−1)

(50)

The action integral S ′ = S ′ (φ, φµ, R,∇µR) is promptly obtained by subtituting Eq. (50) into (6). Then,

one uses the deﬁnition of Φ, Eq. (8), to obtain:

S ′ =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)ΦR −

1
2c0

(Φ + ∇µφµ − 1)2 −

φµφµ
2c1

+ LM(cid:21) .

By extracting the variation of this action, one gets the ﬁeld equations as being precisely Eqs. (16), (17),
(18) and (20) with Eq. (50) replacing U . Combining the equation of motion obtained in the way described
previously, results in the following set of coupled equations for the scalar-vectorial part of S ′:

φµ

The action (47) can be rewritten, up to surface terms, as

(Φ + ∇γφγ − 1)i = 0 .
S =Z d4x√−ghR +

This action is singular according to the approach considered here. A similar action was analyzed by Wands
in [40]. In his case, he introduced two scalar ﬁelds instead of a scalar and a vector ﬁelds. If the ﬁeld equations
were analyzed in his context, it would be possible to check that the two scalar ﬁelds would be dynamical
ﬁelds [41]. Here, the ﬁeld equations indicate that only Φ and φ0 are dynamical quantities while φi satisfy
constraint equations. So, in both cases there are just two additional degrees of freedom, showing the physical
consistency between Wands’ approach and ours.

4.2 Palatini formalism

The starting point is

The tensorial ﬁelds are deﬁned as above and the calculations lead to the following expression for S ′:

S =Z d4x√−ghR +
S ′ =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)ΦR −

Substituting R in terms of R leads to:
S ′ =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)ΦR +

which is the Brans-Dicke action.

φµφµ
2c1

+ LM(cid:21) ,

The ﬁeld equations are speciﬁed from (48), (26) and (23)-(25) and lead to the following coupled equations

for the scalar-vectorial part of S ′:

Φ =

c0

∇β φβ −1hκT − φµφµ

c1 − 1

c0 (cid:0)∇βφβ − 1(cid:1)2i ,

φµ

c1 − ∇µh 1

c0

(Φ + ∇γ φγ − 1)i = 0 .




The ﬁrst equation is a constraint equation for Φ. Therefore, only φ0 satisﬁes a dynamical equation. This is
diﬀerent from what is obtained in the metric approach where both quantities are dynamical.

4.3 Generalization: Starobinsky-Podolski-higher-order action

The previous system may be generalized to:

S =Z d4x√−ghR +

c0

R2 +

c1
2 ∇µR∇µR + ... +

cn

2 ∇µ1 ...∇µn R∇µ1 ...∇µn R + LMi ,

which implies

The condition

The results and conclusions are analogous to the previous one, where the potential takes the form:

.

When considering the second order case, it was seen that by partial integration the higher order term
∇µR∇µR could be written as R(cid:3)R. Hence, one might wonder if it would be possible to proceed in a similar

10

way for the generalized case and obtain an action with only R(cid:3)nR terms. The answer is no: If the term
∇µ1∇µ2 R∇µ1∇µ2 R is considered, by partial integration it is possible to verify that a Ricci tensor appears,
i.e.

∇µ1∇µ2 R∇µ1∇µ2 R = R(cid:3)2R + R∇µ1 (Rµ2µ1∇µ2 R) + ∂µSµ

(2)

For high order terms the situation is even more complicated because there appears Riemann tensors too.
Thus, in the generalized case there is no equivalence between f (R,∇R, ...,∇nR) and f (R, (cid:3)R, ..., (cid:3)nR)
theories.

5 Final Remarks

The equivalence of f (R,∇R, ...) theories and scalar-tensorial models has been studied in both metric and
Palatini formalisms. It has been demonstrated that, besides the scalar ﬁeld usually obtained in the equiv-
alence of f (R) gravity to scalar-tensor theories, it is also necessary to introduce a tensorial ﬁeld for each
order of derivative of the scalar curvature. Moreover, it has been veriﬁed that when deﬁning the scalar ﬁeld
as a functional derivative, only the scalar ﬁeld Φ is coupled to the scalar curvature. The other tensor ﬁelds
are minimally coupled to the gravitational ﬁeld.

Both metric and Palatini approaches show that the scalar-tensorial theory from f (R,∇R, ...) gravity is
an extension of Brans-Dicke theory with ω0 = 0 or ω0 = − 3
2 , respectively. Although no kinetic term for Φ is
present in S ′ in the metric formalism, this does not mean that no dynamics is carried by Φ. In the Palatini
formalism, the opposite situation is found: even in the presence of the kinetic term, a constraint equation is
obtained for Φ. These results are known on f (R) gravity and are also valid for f (R,∇R, ...) theories.
It should be emphasized that f (R,∇R, ...) theories are not the same as those coming from f (R, (cid:3)R, ...)
[40]. As shown in section 4.3, theories of the type f (R,∇R, ...) diﬀer from those built from f (R, (cid:3)R, ...) by
terms involving the Ricci and Riemann tensors. Nevertheless, f (R,∇R, ...) gravity reduces to f (R, (cid:3)R, ...)
models by taking appropriate contractions of indexes. In this sense, the theories considered in the present
paper contain f (R, (cid:3)R, ...) models, although these last fall in the category of singular systems.

The ﬁeld equations for f (R) and f (R,∇R, ...) gravities in the Brans-Dicke form1 exhibit the same struc-
ture under the generalization of f ′ to a functional derivative. Despite this similarity, almost all generic
results of f (R) gravity must be re-derived for speciﬁc applications such as cosmology and the weak-ﬁeld
limit. An exception occurs with the Ehlers-Geren-Sachs (ECG) cosmology theorem [42]. As shown in
Refs.
[43, 44], the theorem ECG is valid for any scalar-tensor theory regardless the potential structure
U = U (Φ, φµ, ...,∇µφµ, ...). This means that one can use FLRW space-time element to describe the cosmic
dynamics. This fact was actually used in Ref. [31] as an attempt to describe dark energy dynamics with a
theory coming from an Einstein-Hilbert-Podolsky action of the type f (R,∇µR) = R + c1
A substantial diﬀerence between f (R) and f (R,∇R, ...) actions concerns their propagation modes. For
example, besides the massless mode, the Starobinsky action has only one massive mode of propagation
corresponding to a positive square mass [2]. On the other hand, Starobinski-Podolsky action presents
positive (massive mode), negative (tachyon mode) and complex square masses [38]. These features lead to
important consequences such as instabilities or lack of unitarity and, in principle, they could be used to
constrain the physical actions. These aspects are under consideration by the authors.

As a future work, it would be interesting to explore the consequences of f (R,∇R, ...) gravity to cosmology.
Following a program similar to the one developed in the f (R) context [16], one might study the general
features of f (R,∇R, ...) cosmology in both metric and Palatini formalisms. This preliminary investigation
would be an important step towards addressing more speciﬁc cosmological issues such as the present-day
acceleration and the inﬂationary period.
