AN EFFECTIVE THEORY OF GW AND FJRW INVARIANTS

OF QUINTICS CALABI-YAU MANIFOLDS

HUAI-LIANG CHANG, JUN LI, WEI-PING LI, AND CHIU-CHU MELISSA LIU

Abstract. This is the second part of the project toward an eﬀective algo-
rithm to evaluate all genus Gromov-Witten invariants of quintic Calabi-Yau
threefolds. In this paper, the localization formula is derived, and algorithms
toward evaluating these Gromov-Witten invariants are derived.

1. Introduction

In [CLLL], we introduced the notion of Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) ﬁelds

(1.1)

ξ = (ΣC, C, L, N, ϕ, ρ, ν)

consisting of pointed twisted curves ΣC ⊂ C, line bundles L and N, and ﬁelds
ϕ ∈ H 0(L⊕5), ρ ∈ H 0(L∨⊗5 ⊗ ωlog
C ), and ν ∈ H 0(L ⊗ N ⊕ N). Its numerical
invariants are the genus g of C, the monodromy γi of L at the marking ΣC
i ⊂ ΣC,
and the degrees d0 = deg L ⊗ N and d∞ = deg N, subject to certain non-
degeneracy constraints.
In the same paper, we constructed the moduli Wg,γ,d of the MSP ﬁelds of
data g, γ = (γ1, · · · , γℓ) and d = (d0, d∞), and proved that they are Gm-DM
stacks, have Gm-equivariant relative perfect obstruction theories, and admit
Gm-invariant cosections (of their their obstruction sheaves) with proper de-
generacy loci. Applying the cosection localized virtual cycle construction, we
obtain (properly supported) Gm-equivariant cycles [Wg,γ,d]vir
loc.

In this paper, we will derive a class of vanishings using these cycles. Ap-
plying the virtual localization formula to these vanishings, we ﬁnd polynomial
relations among the GW invariants and the FJRW invariants of Fermat quintic
polynomials:

These relations provide an eﬀective algorithm to evaluate all genus GW in-
variants of quintic threefolds, and all genus FJRW invariants of Fermat quintics

Using relations (1.2), we obtain

Theorem 1.1. The relations (1.2) with γ = ∅ and d∞ = 0 provide an eﬀective
algorithm to determine the GW invariants Ng,d, provided

(1) Ng,d′ are known for d′ < g;
(2) Ng′,d′ are known for g′ < g and d′ < d;
(3) Θg′,k′ are known for g′ ≤ g and k′ ≤ 2g − 2.

Theorem 1.2. The relations (1.2) with γ = ∅, d0 = 0 and d∞ ≥ g provide
an eﬀective algorithm to determine the FJRW invariants Θg,k, provided that
Θg′,k′ are known for each g′ ≤ g and 0 ≤ k′ < 7g′ − 2;

In particular all genus one FJRW invariants Θ1,k for quintic singularity
can be evaluated. (FJRW invariants Θ0,k were calculated via Grothendieck-
Riemann-Roch formula in [CR].)

We conjecture that initial values requirement (1) in Theorem 1.1 can be

dropped by utilizing more relations in (1.2).

Conjecture 1.3. By choosing d0 and d∞ positive, the relations (1.2) provide
an eﬀective algorithm to determine all genus GW invariant Ng,d, provided that

(1) Ng′,d′ are known for g′ < g, d′ ≤ d, and
(2) Θg′,k′ are known for g′ ≤ g and k′ < 7g − 2.
Note that the range of k′ needed in Θg′,k′ in Theorem 1.2 and Conjecture
1.3 are substantially larger than that in Theorem 1.1. To fully determine all
FJRW invariants, we propose

Conjecture 1.4. The polynomial relations among FJRW invariants Θg,k de-
)×ℓ can eﬀectively
rived using the relations (1.2) with d0 = 0 and γ ∈ (µ
evaluate all Θg,k.

We comment that the algorithms become eﬀective if certain (leading) coeﬃ-
cients are non-zero. We have tested a few examples of the relations mentioned
in Conjecture 1.3 and 1.4. They are non-zero.

This work was inspired by the work of Fan-Jaris-Ruan on their analytic
construction of FJRW invariants [FJR1], and by Witten’s vision that “Calabi-
Yau and Landau-Ginzburg (are) separated by a true phase transition” [Wi]. In
realizing Witten’s vision, we introduced a new ﬁeld ν, which is our attempt to

GW AND FJRW INVARIANTS OF QUINTIC CALABI-YAU MANIFOLDS

3

“quantize” the Witten’s parameter in his phase transition between Calabi-Yau
and Landau-Ginzberg theories.

After introducing the GW invariants of stable maps with p-ﬁelds and prov-
ing their equivalence with the GW invariants of quintic threefolds by the ﬁrst
two named authors [CL1], our goal is to search for a geometric theory of
wall crossings envisioned by Witten. In [CLL], the ﬁrst three named authors
(re)reconstructed the (narrow) FJRW invariants using cosection localized vir-
tual cycles, and in [CLLL] the authors introduced the theory of Mixed-Spin-P
ﬁelds. This paper sets up the foundation for applying MSP ﬁeld theory to
study GW and FJRW invariants of Fermat quintics.

There are fresh attempts to understand all genus GW invariants of quintics;
one of them by Fan-Jarvis-Ruan [FJR3] in which they proposed a version of
GLSM theory.
(See also the work of Tian-Xu [TX1, TX2].) We comment
that though the MSP ﬁelds theory resembles the case [FJR3, Example 4.2.23],
indeed [FJR3] and the MSP ﬁeld theory are diﬀerent approaches to CY/LG
correspondence, which will be clariﬁed in Subsection 5.8. The work of Choi and
Kiem [ChK] introduced additional δ-stability to study wall-crossings, toward
all genus GW invariants of quintic CY threefolds.

This paper is organized as follows. In §2, after reviewing the basic proper-
ties of MSP ﬁelds and their moduli spaces, we work out the the topological
characterization of a partition of the C∗-ﬁxed locus of the moduli space. In
§3, we work out the cosection localized virtual cycle of the ﬁxed locus. The
data in the virtual localization formula associated to the moving parts will be
worked out in the following section. In §5, we derive a vanishing, and using
this relation to prove the main theorems of this paper.

2. Moduli of T -invariant MSP-fields

In this section, we apply the cosection localized version of the virtual local-
ization formula of [GP] to the cycle [Wg,γ,d]vir
loc to obtain the vanishing (1.2).
The proof of this version of virtual localization formula is in [CKL]. In this
paper, all twisted curves are nodal curves.

Throughout this paper, unless otherwise mentioned, for any closed point

ξ ∈ Wg,γ,d we understand that ξ is (ΣC, C, L, · · · ) given in (1.1).

2.2. Decorated graphs of torus ﬁxed MSP ﬁelds. By the main theorem
of [CLLL], the category Wg,γ,d of families of MSP-ﬁelds of data (g, γ, d) is a
separated DM stack. Let T = Gm, and endow Wg,γ,d a T -structure, via

t · (C, ΣC, L, N, ϕ, ρ, ν1, ν2) = (C, ΣC, L, N, ϕ, ρ, tν1, ν2).
(2.2)
In this subsection, we study the T -ﬁxed locus (Wg,γ,d)T ⊂ Wg,γ,d.

In the following, we ﬁx a (g, γ, d). For notational simplicity, whenever

(g, γ, d) is understood, we will adopt the convention

(2.3)

W = Wg,γ,d, W− = W−g,γ,d,

and W T = (Wg,γ,d)T .

Let ξ ∈ W T . Following the deﬁnition of T ﬁxed points, and after a standard
algebraic argument, we conclude that there is a homomorphism h and T -
linearizations τ and τ′ (satisfying the obvious relations) as follows
τt : ht∗L → L and τ′t : ht∗N → N,

h : T → Aut(C, ΣC);

such that for a ̺ ∈ Z+,
(2.4)
We call such T -actions and linearizations those induced from ξ ∈ W T .
Using that ξ ∈ W T is stable, one sees that such (h, τt, τ′t) is unique.

t · (ϕ, ρ, ν1, ν2) = (τt, τ′t)(ht∗ϕ, ht∗ρ, t̺ht∗ν1, ht∗ν2),

t ∈ T.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Given ξ ∈ W T , let C0 = C∩(ν1 = 0)red, C∞ = C∩(ν2 = 0)red,
C1 = C∩(ρ = ϕ = 0)red, C01 (resp. C1∞) be the union of irreducible components
of C − C0 ∪ C1 ∪ C∞ in (ρ = 0) (resp. in (ϕ = 0)), and C0∞ be the union of
irreducible components of C not contained in C0 ∪ C1 ∪ C∞ ∪ C01 ∪ C1∞.

As argued in [CLLL], C0, C1 and C∞ are mutually disjoint. By deﬁnition, all
C01, C0∞ and C1∞ are pure one-dimensional, and T -equivariant curves under
h. We recall a simple lemma (cf. [CLLL, Lemma 3.2]).

Lemma 2.3. Let T → Aut(P1) be a non-trivial homomorphism of algebraic
groups whose induced action on P1 ﬁxes [0, 1] and [1, 0], and let L be a T -
linearized line bundle on P1 such that T acts trivially on L|[0,1]. Then
(1) any invariant section s ∈ H 0(L)T with s|[0,1] = 0 must be zero;
(2) suppose T acts trivially on L|[1,0], then L ∼= O

P1.

Lemma 2.4. Let ξ ∈ W T . Then

(1) the action h : T → Aut(C, ΣC) acts trivially on C0, C1 and C∞;
(2) every irreducible component A ⊂ C01 (resp. A ⊂ C1∞; resp. A ⊂ C0∞)
is a smooth rational twisted curve with two T -ﬁxed points lying on C0
and C1 (resp. C1 and C∞; resp. C0 and C∞).

(3) if ξ ∈ W−, then C0∞ = ∅.

Proof. We prove that h ﬁxes C0. Let A ⊂ C0 be an irreducible component
over which h|A is non-trivial. Then A must be a rational curve. Let x ∈ A be
ﬁxed by h. Since both ϕ(x) and ν2(x) are non-zero, τt|x = τ′t|x = id (notice
ν1|A = 0). Thus Lemma 2.3 shows that the component A makes ξ unstable, a
contradiction. Thus h ﬁxes A. Likewise, h also ﬁxes C1 and C∞.
We next ﬁx an irreducible component A ⊂ C01 and investigate the action
h|A. First, by deﬁnition of C01, ν2|A is nowhere vanishing, thus N|A ∼= OA.
Let x ∈ A. Suppose h|A ﬁxes x. It is easy to see that one of ϕ(x) and ν1(x)
must be zero. If x is a general point of A, then by deﬁnition of C01, both ϕ(x)
and ν1(x) are non-zero. This proves that h|A acts non-trivially on A, implying
that A is rational.

We claim that A ⊂ C01 must be smooth. Otherwise, let x ∈ A be a node of
A, which must be ﬁxed by h|A. Then apply Lemma 2.3, and using that either
ν1(x) 6= 0 or ϕ(x) 6= 0, we conclude that L|A ∼= OA, which forces ξ unstable, a
contradiction.

As A is smooth, h|A has two ﬁxed points, say x1, x2 ∈ A. Like before,
if both ϕ(x1) and ϕ(x2) are non-zero, then L|A ∼= OA, forcing ξ unstable, a
contradiction; if both ϕ(x1) and ϕ(x2) are zero, then both ν1(x1) and ν1(x2)
are non-zero, forcing L|A ∼= OA and ϕ|A = 0, implying that A ⊂ C1, impossible.
This proves that one of x1 and x2 lies in C0 and the other lies in C1.

A similar argument shows that the parallel conclusion holds for A ⊂ C1∞
and C0∞. Finally, (3) follows from that both ρ and ϕ are non-zero on every
irreducible component of C0∞.

We now associate a decorated graph to each ξ ∈ W T . For a graph Γ, besides

its vertices V (Γ), edges E(Γ) and legs L(Γ), the set of its ﬂags is

F (Γ) = {(e, v) ∈ E(Γ) × V (Γ) : v ∈ e}.

Given ξ ∈ W T , let π : Cnor → C be its normalization. For any y ∈ π−1(Csing),

we denote by γy the monodromy of π∗L along y.

Deﬁnition 2.5. To each ξ ∈ W T we associate a graph Γξ as follows:

(1) (vertex) let V0(Γξ), V1(Γξ), and V∞(Γξ) be the set of connected compo-
nents of C0, C1, C∞ respectively, and let V (Γξ) be their union;
(2) (edge) let E0(Γξ), E∞(Γξ) and E0∞(Γξ) be the set of irreducible com-
ponents of C01, C1∞ and C0∞ respectively, and let E(Γξ) be their union;
(3) (leg) let L(Γξ) ∼= {1, · · · , ℓ} be the ordered set of markings of ΣC, ΣC
i ∈

L(Γξ) is attached to v ∈ V (Γξ) if ΣC

i ∈ Cv;

(4) (ﬂag) (e, v) ∈ F (Γξ) if and only if Ce ∩ Cv 6= ∅.

(Here Ca is the curve associated to the symbol a ∈ V (Γξ) ∪ E(Γξ).) We call
v ∈ V (Γξ) stable if Cv ⊂ C is 1-dimensional, otherwise unstable.

In the following,

V U (Γξ) ⊂ V (Γξ) be the set of unstable vertices. Given v ∈ V (Γξ),
Ev = {e ∈ E(Γξ) : (e, v) ∈ F (Γξ)}. For v ∈ V S(Γξ), we deﬁne

let V S(Γξ) ⊂ V (Γξ) be the set of stable vertices and
let

called the inner, the outer, and the total markings of Cv, respectively.

out = (C − Cv) ∩ Cv,

and ΣCv = ΣCv

Deﬁnition 2.6. We endow the graph Γξ a decoration as follows:

(a) (genus) Deﬁne ~g : V (Γξ) → Z≥0 via ~g(v) = h1(OCv ).
(b) (degree) Deﬁne ~d : E(Γξ) ∪ V (Γξ) → Q⊕2 via ~d(a) = (d0a, d∞a), where
(c) (marking) Deﬁne ~S : V (Γξ) → 2L(Γξ) via v 7→ Sv ⊂ L(Γξ), where Sv is

d0a = deg L ⊗ N|Ca and d∞a = deg N|Ca .

(d) (monodromy) Deﬁne ~γ : L(Γξ) → µ5 via ~γ(ΣC

i ) = γi, which is the

monodromy of L along ΣC
i .

For ξ ∈ W T , the graph Γξ is the one deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.5 endowed with
the decoration given in this deﬁnition.

For convenience, we denote da = d0a − d∞a, i.e., da = deg L|Ca. For c ∈
{0, 1, ∞}, let V S
c (Γξ) = Vc(Γξ) ∩ V S(Γξ). For v ∈ V (Γξ), the valency of v is
the cardinality of Ev: val(v) = |Ev|. Let nv = |Ev ∪ Sv|. When v is stable, as
Sv and Ev parameterize the inner and outer markings of Cv respectively, nv is
the number of total markings of Cv.

For v ∈ V S

∞(Γξ), we decorate elements in Ev ∪ Sv as follows. For a ∈ Sv, we
decorate it by the same γa that decorates a ∈ L(Γ); for e ∈ Ev, we decorate it

GW AND FJRW INVARIANTS OF QUINTIC CALABI-YAU MANIFOLDS

by γ(e,v) := e−2π√−1de ∈ µ5, (de = deg L|Ce,) which is the monodromy of L|Cv
along y(e,v) = Ce ∩ Cv. Deﬁne

(2.5)

γv = {γa : a ∈ Sv} ∪ {γ(e,v) : e ∈ Ev}.

Elements in γv are indexed by Sv ∪ Ev.

We form

(2.6)

V a,b(Γξ) = {v ∈ V (Γξ) − V S(Γξ) | |Sv| = a, |Ev| = b}.

We have a disjoint union

V (Γξ) = V S(Γξ) ∪ V 0,1(Γξ) ∪ V 0,2(Γξ) ∪ V 1,1(Γξ).

We also adopt the convention V a,b

c

(Γξ) = Vc(Γξ) ∩ V a,b(Γξ).

Let

∆g,γ,d = {Γξ | ξ ∈ W T }/ ∼=, ∆ =a ∆g,γ,d,

(2.7)
where ∼= is the equivalence induced by isomorphisms of graphs preserving da-
tum in Deﬁnitions 2.5 and 2.6, including the partition V (Γ) = V0(Γ) ∪ V1(Γ) ∪
V∞(Γ), etc.. The disjoint union is taken over all possible (g, γ, d).
2.3. Decompositions of torus ﬁxed MSP-ﬁelds. We continue to abbrevi-
ate Wg,γ,d by W, as in (2.3). Let ξ ∈ W T . We will characterize the structure
of Ca and ξ|Ca for each a ∈ V S(Γξ)∪E(Γξ). First, by allowing rational weights,
we can assume the exponent ̺ = 1 in (2.4). Then that ξ is T -ﬁxed can be
summarized in that there are representation ht and linearizations τt and τ′t as
in (2.4) so that under their induced actions, together with Lk the dimension
one weight k T -representation,

ϕ ∈ H 0(L⊕5)T , ρ ∈ H 0(L∨⊗5 ⊗ ωlog

C )T , (ν1, ν2) ∈ H 0(L ⊗ N ⊗ L1 ⊕ N)T

are T -invariant. As a direct consequence, we have the following remark.
Remark 2.7. When p ∈ C0, then as ϕ|p and ν2|p are nonzero, we have L|p ∼=
N|p ∼= L0. When p ∈ C1, then ν1|p and ν2|p are nonzero and hence L ⊗ N ⊗
L1|p ∼= N|p ∼= L0. When p ∈ C∞, then ρ|p and ν1|p are nonzero and thus
L∨⊗5 ⊗ ωlog

C |p ∼= L ⊗ N ⊗ L1|p ∼= L0.

Example 2.8 (Stable maps with p-ﬁelds). A stable MSP-ﬁeld ξ ∈ W having
ν1 = 0 will have N ∼= OC, ν2 = 1, and then ξ is a pair of a stable map
f = [ϕ] : ΣC ⊂ C → P4 and a p-ﬁeld ρ ∈ H 0(f∗OP4(−5) ⊗ ωC).

Example 2.9 (5-spin curves with ﬁve p-ﬁelds). A stable MSP-ﬁeld ξ ∈ W
having ν2 = 0 will have N ∼= L∨, ν1 = 1 and then ξ is a pair of a 5-spin curve
(ΣC, C, ρ : L⊗5 ∼= ωlog

C ) and ﬁve p-ﬁelds ϕ ∈ H 0(L)⊕5, with ϕ|ΣC

= 0.

Cv → P4; together with the marking ΣCv = ΣCv

they form an Ev ∪Sv-pointed, genus gv, degree dv stable map to P4 with
p-ﬁeld.

(b) For v ∈ V S
(c) For v ∈ V S

1 (Γ), ΣCv ⊂ Cv is an Ev ∪ Sv-pointed, genus gv stable curve.
∞(Γ), let γv = {γi : i ∈ Sv} ∪ {γ(e,v) : e ∈ Ev}. Suppose all
γi and γ(e,v) in γv lie in µ5 − {1}, then (ΣCv , Cv) with (L, ρ, ϕ)|Cv is a
5-spin Ev ∪ Sv-pointed twisted curve with ﬁve p-ﬁelds.

Proof. The proof is straightforward, and will be omitted. Note that E0∞(Γξ) =
∅ guarantees that ϕ|y(e,v) = 0 in case (c) and ρ|y(e,v) = 0 in case (a).

(cid:3)

We now move to e ∈ E0(Γξ). By Lemma 2.4 we know Ce ∼= P1. Let
v ∈ V0(Γξ) and v′ ∈ V1(Γξ) with (e, v) and (e, v′) ∈ F (Γ). Let q = Ce ∩ Cv and
q′ = Ce ∩ Cv′. We give Ce the homogeneous coordinate [x, y] so that [1, 0] = q
and [0, 1] = q′. Recall that de = d0e − d∞e.
Lemma 2.11. Let the notations be as stated. Then N|Ce
OP1(de), and for some (c1, . . . , c5) ∈ C5 − 0 and c ∈ C×,

∼= OP1, L|Ce

∼=

(ϕ1, · · · , ϕ5; ρ; ν1, ν2)|Ce = (c1xde, · · · , c5xde; 0; cyde , 1).

∼= O

P1(de). Since q ∈ C0, the linearization
Proof. Because deg L|Ce = de, L|Ce
τt|q = id. Thus the induced T -linearization on H 0(L|Ce) ∼= H 0(O
P1(de)) is via
t · xde−iyi = tikxde−iyi, for some k 6= 0, and H 0(O
P1(de))T = C · xde. Since
ϕi|Ce are T -invariant, and ν1|Ce is T -equivariant (of certain weight) and non-
vanishing at q′, there are c, ci ∈ C so that φi|Ce = cixde and ν1|Ce = cyde . As
ν1(q′) 6= 0, c 6= 0; as ϕ(q) 6= 0, (c1, . . . , c5) 6= 0. This proves the lemma.
(cid:3)

We next consider e ∈ E∞(Γξ). By Lemma 2.11 we know that Ce is a smooth
rational curve. It is isomorphic to P1 when de ∈ Z, and isomorphic to P(5, 1)
and having Ce ∩ C∞ its only stacky point when de 6∈ Z. Since ν1|Ce is nowhere
vanishing, any linearization on L|Ce will induce a linearization on N|Ce keeping
ν1|Ce a T -invariant section of L ⊗ N|Ce ⊗ L1.
Convention on P(5, 1). Let (X, q, q′) = (P(5, 1), [1, 0], [0, 1]), with a homoge-
neous coordinates [˜x, ˜y], where q = [1, 0] is its only stacky point. And x = ˜x
and y = ˜y5 descend to its coarse moduli X = P1 and form a correspond-
5 Z, we agree OX(c) ∼= OX(5c q) and
ing homogeneous coordinates. For c ∈ 1
deg OX(q) = 1/5. Thus H 0(OX(c)) ∼= H 0(OX (⌊c⌋)). In the notation of Mm
before (2.18), near q OX(c) is the module ˜y−mC[˜y], where m = 5c − 5⌊c⌋.

Let v ∈ V∞(Γξ) and v′ ∈ V1(Γξ) be vertices so that (e, v) and (e, v′) ∈ F (Γξ),
and let q = Ce ∩ Cv and q′ = Ce ∩ Cv′. We endow Ce a homogeneous coordinate
[x, y] (resp. [˜x, ˜y]) so that q = [1, 0] and q′ = [0, 1] when Ce ∼= P1 (resp. P(5, 1)),
following the convention just stated.

We set δ = −1 when dim Cv = 0, Sv = ∅ and |Ev| = 1 (equivalently

v ∈ V 0,1
δ′ = 0 otherwise. Note that when de = d0e − d∞e 6∈ Z, δ = 0.
Lemma 2.12. Let e ∈ E∞(Γξ) be as stated. Then ϕ|Ce = 0, N|Ce
and ν1|Ce is never zero. Furthermore, ωlog

consider the case Ce ∼= P1. Again, ωlog

This proves the furthermore part of the lemma in this case.

We now prove the furthermore part when Ce ∼= P(5, 1). In this case, we know

This proves the lemma.

Lastly, we consider e ∈ E0∞(Γξ). Let (e, v) and (e, v′) ∈ F (Γξ) with v ∈

V∞(Γξ) and v′ ∈ V0(Γξ). Let q = Ce ∩ Cv and q′ = Ce ∩ Cv′.
Lemma 2.13. Let e ∈ E0∞(Γξ) be as stated. Then Ce ∼= P1, q is a node of
∼= OCe(d∞e). Furthermore, for homogeneous
C, L|Ce
coordinates [x, y] of Ce so that q = [1, 0] and q′ = [0, 1], there are constants c’s
so that ν1|Ce = cxd∞e, ν2|Ce = c′yd∞e, ϕ|Ce = (c1, · · · , c5) and ρ|Ce = c′′.
Proof. Since ϕ(q′) 6= 0, we have deg L|Ce ≥ 0. Since ρ(q) 6= 0, we have
deg L∨⊗5 ⊗ ωlog
C |Ce ≤ 0, we have deg L|Ce =
C |Ce = 0. Hence Ce ∼= P1 and q is either a node or a marking. We claim
deg ωlog
that q is not a marking. Suppose not, since ρ(q) 6= 0 and q is a scheme, q must
be labeled by (1, ϕ). On the other hand, as deg L|Ce = 0 and ϕ(q′) 6= 0, we
must have ϕ(q) 6= 0, which is impossible. This proves that q is a node of C.
The remainding part of the lemma is straightforward.

C |Ce ≥ 0. Furthermore, since deg ωlog

We introduce the notion of T -balanced nodes.

Deﬁnition 2.14. Let C be a T -twisted curve and q be a node of C. Let ˆC1

T -balanced if Tq ˆC1 ⊗ Tq ˆC2 ∼= L0 as T -representations.

Let v ∈ V1(Γξ) be an unstable vertex with two distinct (e, v) and (e′, v) ∈

F (Γξ), and let qv = Ce ∩ Ce′ be the node of C associated with v.
Lemma 2.15. Let v ∈ V1(Γξ) be an unstable vertex, etc., as stated. Then qv
is T -balanced if and only if de + de′ = 0, and (Ce ∪ Ce′) ∩ C∞ is a node or a
marking of C.
Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case where e ∈ E∞(Γξ) and e′ ∈ E0(Γξ). Let
q = Ce ∩ C∞ and q′ = Ce′ ∩ C0. By Remark 2.7,
(2.8)

L|q′ ∼= L∨⊗5 ⊗ ωlog

C |q ∼= L0.

Let δ = 0 when q is a node or a marking of C, and = −1 otherwise. Then

since qv is a node, ωlog
C |qv as T -
representations. Since qv is a scheme point, and since L∨⊗5 ⊗ ωlog
C |Ce is a
pullback of an invertible sheaf on the coarse moduli of Ce, combined with
(2.8), we conclude that qv is a T -balanced node if and only if

C |Ce + deg L∨⊗5|C

e′ = 0,

which is −5de + δ − 5de′ = 0. We claim that then δ = 0 and de + de′ = 0.
Indeed, if δ = −1, then Ce is a scheme and de ∈ Z (and de′ ∈ Z), impossible.
Thus δ = 0 and the lemma follows.

The other cases where both e and e′ lie in E0(Γξ) or in E∞(Γξ) can be ruled

out by a similar argument. This proves the lemma.

(cid:3)

Let

(2.9)

N (Γξ) = V 0,2(Γξ) ∪ {(e, v) ∈ F (Γξ) | v ∈ V S(Γξ)}.

Note that every a ∈ N (Γξ) has its associated node qa of C.
Deﬁnition 2.16. We call a ∈ N (Γξ) T -balanced if the associated node qa is
a T -balanced node in C. Let N (Γξ)un ⊂ N (Γξ) be the subset of T -unbalanced
elements.
Proposition 2.17. Let ξ ∈ W T with decorated graph Γξ. Then qa, a ∈ N (Γξ),
is T -balanced if and only if a ∈ V 0,2
(Γξ) and satisﬁes the condition in Lemma
2.15. Furthermore, the set of T -unbalanced nodes of C is {qa | a ∈ N (Γξ)un}.
Proof. Let qa be a node indexed by a ∈ N (Γξ). Then a repetition of the proof
of Lemma 2.15 shows that qa is T -balanced only if a ∈ V 0,2
(Γξ), and satisﬁes
the criterion in Lemma 2.15.

To complete the proof, we need to show that any node q of C not listed in
{qa | a ∈ N (Γξ)}, must be T -balanced. Indeed, such q must be a node of one
of C0, C1 and C∞. Since T acts trivially on these curves, q must be a balanced
node. This proves the proposition.

(cid:3)

Although a T -balanced a ∈ N (Γξ) is characterized by qa being T -balanced,
by Lemma 2.15 it can also be characterized by the information of the (deco-
rated) graph Γξ. Thus for any Γ ∈ ∆, we can talk about N (Γ)un ⊂ N (Γ).

Deﬁnition 2.18. A decorated graph Γ is called a ﬂat graph if N (Γ)un = N (Γ).

2.4. Γ-framed MSP ﬁelds. We recall the convention of decomposing a fam-
ily of nodal curves along its nodal locus. We continue to denote W = Wg,γ,d.

Deﬁnition 2.19. Let S be a scheme and let CS be a ﬂat S-family of twisted
curves. We say that CS can be decomposed along nodes QS ⊂ CS if QS is a
closed substack of CS that is a gerbe over S and homeomorphic to S, so that
there are a ﬂat S-family of twisted curves ˜CS, an S-morphism ˜CS → CS, and
two disjoint closed S-embeddings h1, h2 : QS → ˜CS so that

homS(CS, ·) = {f ∈ homS(˜CS, ·) | h1 ◦ f ≈ h2 ◦ f }.

(See [AGV, A.1] for precise formulation of ≈.) If CS can be decomposed along
QS, we call QS an S-family of nodes.

If C is a twisted curve with only one node q ∈ C, then the decomposition
of C along q is the normalization ˜C of C, and h1, h2 : q → ˜C are the two
preimages of q via the projection ˜C → C. Note that we can decompose along
several disjoint S-families of nodes by applying this procedure repeatedly to
each S-family of nodes.

We now assume that CS is an S-family of T -curves, meaning that T acts
on CS and commutes with the trivial T -action on S. We have the following
well-known existence of decomposition along families of nodes.

Lemma 2.20. Let s ∈ S be a closed point in a DM stack, let CS be a ﬂat
S-family of nodal twisted T -curves, and let q ∈ Cs be a T -unbalanced node of
Cs. Then there is an ´etale neighborhood ˜s ∈ ˜S → S, ˜s 7→ s, so that we can
extend ˜q = q × ˜S ˜s ∈ Cs|˜s to an ˜S-family of nodes Q ˜S ⊂ CS| ˜S.

A simple observation shows that such decomposition may not exists for T -
balanced nodes. Thus we need to modify the graph Γξ in case N (Γξ) contains
T -balanced node in order to be able to decompose families along nodes char-
acterized by the graph. To achieve this, we construct a ﬂattening of Γξ which
eliminates T -balanced nodes from the graph.

Construction 2.21. For each T -balanced v ∈ N (Γξ), which necessarily is an
unstable vertex in V1(Γξ), we eliminate the vertex v from Γξ, replace the two
edges e ∈ E∞(Γξ) and e′ ∈ E0(Γξ) incident to v by a single edge ˜e incident
to the other two vertices that are incident to e or e′, and demand that ˜e lies
in E0∞. For the decorations, we agree ~g(˜e) = 0 and (d0˜e, d∞˜e) = (d∞e, d∞e),
while keeping the rest unchanged. The resulting decorated graph is called the
ﬂattening of Γξ at v.

Let Γﬂ

ξ be the graph after applying this to all T -balanced v in N (Γξ). We
ξ ) = N (Γξ)un, or equivalently

call it the ﬂattening of Γξ. As the result, N (Γﬂ
Γﬂ
ξ is a ﬂat graph.

Deﬁnition 2.22 (Standard decomposition). For any ξ ∈ W T with the domain
curve C, we can decompose C along its T -unbalanced nodes qa, a ∈ N (Γξ)un =
N (Γﬂ

ξ ), to obtain connected subcurves Cb indexed by
ξ ) ∪ E(Γﬂ

ξ ) := V S(Γﬂ

b ∈ Ξ(Γﬂ

ξ ).

Deﬁnition 2.23. Given Γ ∈ ∆ so that Γ = Γﬂ, and given a scheme S, a
Γ-framed S-family in W T consists of a pair (ξS, ǫS), where

(2.10)

ξS ∈ W T (S)

and

ǫS = {ǫs : Γ ∼= Γﬂ

ξs | s ∈ S a closed point},

such that if for each closed point s ∈ S we let qs,a = qs,ǫs(a) for a ∈ N (Γ)
and Cs,b = Cs,ǫs(b) for b ∈ Ξ(Γ) be the result of the standard decomposition
Cs,b are closed

of ξS ×S s = (Cs, · · · ), then the unions `s∈S qs,a and `s∈S

substacks of the domain curve CS of ξS, and are ﬂat over Sred.

Applying Lemma 2.20, we see that given a connected scheme and any Γ-
framed S-family in W T with CS its total space of base curves, we have an
S-family of nodes QS,a ⊂ CS indexed by a ∈ N (Γ) so that they decompose CS
into S-ﬂat families of connected subcurves CS,b indexed by b ∈ Ξ(Γ). (Here
Γ = Γﬂ automatically when we speak of Γ-framed families.)

g,γ,d.

Proposition 2.24. Let W(Γ) be the image of the forgetful morphism ιΓ : WΓ →
W T . Then W(Γ) is an open and closed substack of W T . Let ιΓ be factored as

(2.11)

ιΓ : WΓ

ıΓ−→ W(Γ)

Γ−→ W T .

Then ıΓ is an Aut(Γ)-torsor.

Proof. That W(Γ) is open and closed follows from lemma 2.20 and the deﬁnition
of Γ-framed MSP ﬁelds, the other parts are straightforward to prove, and will
be omitted.
(cid:3)

We end this subsection with the notion of Γ-framed curve (C, ΣC, L, N).
Recall that given a ﬂat Γ and a (ξ, ǫ) ∈ WΓ, where ξ = (C, · · · ), etc., we not
only have an identiﬁcation of the T -unbalanced nodes of C with N (Γ), but also
have a tautological identiﬁcation of branches of these T -unbalanced nodes: Let
q ∈ C be a T -unbalanced node. Then we have

(I) when q is identiﬁed with an (e, v) ∈ N (Γ), v ∈ V S(Γ), then the two

branches of C along q are labeled by v and e;

(II) when q is identiﬁed with a v ∈ V U (Γ), then the two branches of C

along q are labeled by (e1, v) and (e2, v) ∈ F (Γ).

Deﬁnition 2.25. A Γ-framed curve consists of T -equivariant (C, ΣC, L, N)1
such that

(1) ΣC is labeled by legs in Γ;
(2) T -unbalanced nodes of C are labeled by N (Γ);
(3) branches of T -unbalanced nodes of C are labeled according to rule I and

II above.

Because the conditions in Deﬁnition 2.25 are open, we can speak of ﬂat
family of Γ-framed curves. Let DΓ be the stack of ﬂat families of Γ-framed
curves, where arrows are T -equivariant arrows in D that preserve the labeling
in Deﬁnition 2.25. Here D is the stack of data (C, ΣC, L, N), where ΣC ⊂ C are
pointed twisted curves, and L and N are invertible sheaves on C. Clearly, DΓ
is a smooth Artin stack, and admits a forgetful morphism WΓ → DΓ.

2.5. Decomposition via decoupling. We introduce a decoupling operation
on ﬂat graphs Γ. We use decoupling of the graph Γ to decompose WΓ as a
product of simpler moduli spaces. Let Γ be a ﬂat decorated graph, and let

N (Γ)∗ = V 0.2

1

(Γ) ∪ V 0.2

∞ ∪ {(e, v) ∈ F (Γ) | v ∈ V S

1 (Γ) ∪ V S

∞(Γ), e ∈ E∞ ∪ E0}.

It is subset of N (Γ).

Deﬁnition 2.26. Let Γ ∈ ∆ﬂ be a ﬂat graph, and let a ∈ N (Γ)∗. Let a = (e, v)
and deﬁne the decoupling of Γ along a to be a new graph ¯Γ resulting from Γ by
the following modiﬁcations:
(1) add a new vertex ¯v to Γ and replace the ﬂag (e, v) by (e, ¯v);
(2) add a leg l to v and a leg ¯l to ¯v, decorated via:
• when v ∈ V1(Γ), we decorate them by (1, ρ);
• when v ∈ V∞(Γ) and de,0 6∈ Z, l is decorated by γ(e,v) and ¯l by γ(e,v)−1;
• when v ∈ V∞(Γ) and de,0 ∈ Z, we decorat l and ¯l by (1, ϕ).

Note that in case a ∈ V 0,2(Γ), a = (e, v) or (e′, v). However, the decoupling
using (e, v) and that using (e′, v) are canonically isomorphic. Note that the
resulting graph is possibly not connected.

We apply decoupling repeatedly to all a ∈ N (Γ)∗. Let Γde be the resulting

graph and denote by (Γde)conn the set of connected components of Γde.

For each A ∈ (Γde)conn, we form the moduli WA of A-framed MSP ﬁelds. Let
WΓde be the moduli of Γde-framed MSP ﬁelds. Note that though Γde could be
disconnected, the construction WΓ applies and WΓde is well-deﬁned, resulting
a stack naturally isomorphic to the product of WA for all A ∈ (Γde)conn.

1By T -equivariant we mean that ΣC

⊂ C comes with a T -action, and both L and N are

T -linearized.

14

Lemma 2.27. For each A ∈ (Γde)conn, the decoupling deﬁnes a natural mor-
phism ΦA : WΓ −→ WA, whose products deﬁnes a morphism

Φ =Y ΦA : WΓ −→ WΓde = YA∈(Γde)conn

WA.

Proof. Let a ∈ N (Γ)∗ and let Γ′ be the decoupling of Γ along a. Let WΓ′ be
the moduli of Γ′-framed MSP ﬁelds. We show that there is a natural morphism

(2.12)

φ : WΓ −→ WΓ′.

Let ξT ∈ WΓ(T ) be any family over T , say given by (C, ΣC, L, N , ϕ, ρ, ν).
Because v is stable, by the deﬁnition of Γ-framed MSP ﬁelds, the ﬂag (e, v)
corresponds to a T family of nodes n(e,v) ⊂ C. Let C′ be the partial normaliza-
tion of C along n(e,v), namely, C′ is obtained from C with the two branches of
the node n(e,f ) separated.

Then let ΣC′

= ΣC ×C C′, and let (L′, N ′, ϕ′, ρ′, ν′) be the pullback of
(L, N , ϕ, ρ, ν) via the tautological projection C′ → C.
It is direct to check
that (C′, ΣC′
, L′, N ′, ϕ′, ρ′, ν′) is a T -family of Γ′-framed MSP ﬁelds. As this
construction is canonical, it commutes with base change. Thus it deﬁnes a
morphism φ : WΓ → WΓ′, as desired. Since Γde is derived by repeated apply-
ing decoupling to selected (e, v), by induction, we obtain the desired Φ.
(cid:3)

5 , · · · , ζ ac

Our next step is to show that Φ is an isomorphism. To this end, we
introduce more notations. For convenience, for a vertex v ∈ V∞(Γ) with
γv = {ζ a1
5 }, we abbreviate γv = (0e0 · · · 4e4), where ei is the number
of appearances of i in {a1, · · · , ac}. We call a vertex v ∈ V S
∞(Γ) exceptional if
gv = 0 and γv = (12+k4) or (11+k23) for some k ≥ 0.
Deﬁnition 2.28. We call a v ∈ V∞(Γ) regular if the followings hold:

(1) In case v is stable, then either v is exceptional, or for every a ∈ Sv and

e ∈ Ev we have γa and γ(e,v) ∈ {ζ5, ζ 2

5 }.

(2) In case v is unstable and Cv is a scheme point, then Cv is neither a

node nor a marking of ΣC ⊂ C.

We call Γ regular if it is ﬂat, and such that every v ∈ V∞(Γ) is regular;
otherwise we call it irregular. We denote by ∆reg the collection of regular
graphs in ∆ﬂ.

Let v ∈ V S(Γ). We denote by |v| the one vertex graph consisting of the
vertex v and legs labeled by Ev ∪ Sv. Thus |v| has inherited old legs corre-
sponding to Sv from Γ as well as new legs from Ev. For decoration, except
legs, v in |v| is decorated by the same data as v in Γ, for instance |v| lies in
Va(|v|) when v ∈ Va(Γ). For legs, old legs inherited from Γ have the same
decorations as those in Γ. For new legs, when v ∈ V0(Γ), all new legs in |v|
are decorated by (1, ρ); when v ∈ V1(Γ), news legs in |v| are also decorated by
(1, ρ); when v ∈ V∞(Γ), the new leg in |v| indexed by a ∈ Ev is decorated by

Proposition 2.29. When v ∈ V S
in Lemma 2.10 deﬁne canonical isomorphisms

Wv ∼= M

1/5,5p

Here by Ev ∪ Sv-pointed we mean that the markings are labeled by elements

in Ev ∪ Sv.

Proof. This is the family version of Lemma 2.10. We omit the details here. (cid:3)

Let e ∈ E0(Γ), and let We be the stack parameterizing families of

(c1xde, · · · , c5xde, cyde) ∈ H 0(OP1(de))⊕6, (c1, · · · , c5) 6= 0, c 6= 0,

(2.13)
where [x, y] are homogeneous coordinates of P1. An arrow from (cixde, cyde )
to (c′ixde, c′yde) consists of an isomorphism σ : P1 → P1 ﬁxing [1, 0] and [0, 1],
P1(de) that identiﬁes cixde with c′ixde, and
and an isomorphism O
identiﬁes cyde with c′yde.

P1(de) ∼= σ∗O

Lemma 2.30. For e ∈ E0(Γ), we have the following morphism and isomor-
phism deﬁned by Lemma 2.11:

Φe : WΓ −→ We ∼= depOP4(1)/P4.

Proof. Firstly, we prove the isomorphism. We form [(C5 \ 0)/Gm], where α ∈
Gm acts on C5 \ 0 by α · (c1, . . . , c5) = (αde c1, . . . , αde c5). We ﬁrst show that
the map sending (2.13) to [c−1c1, · · · , c−1c5] ∈ [(C5 \ 0)/Gm] is well-deﬁned.
∼= OP1(de).
Firstly, it is independent of the choice of the isomorphism L|Ce
Indeed, diﬀerent isomorphisms will scale both c and (c1, . . . , c5) by a non-zero
constant leaving (c−1c1, · · · , c−1c5) invariant. On the other hand, given an
automorphism of P1 of the form α · [x, y] = [α−1x, y], then

α · (c1xde, . . . , c5xde, cyde) = (α−de c1xde, . . . , α−de c5xde, cyde ).

This proves that the map We → [(C5 \ 0)/Gm] is well-deﬁned and is an iso-
morphism. Using

we prove the isomorphism part of the Lemma.

[(C5 \ 0)/Gm] ∼= depOP4(1)/P4,

We now deﬁne the morphism Φe. Let (ξS, ǫS) be an S-family in WΓ, and
let s ∈ S be a closed point. Denote ξS = (CS, ΣCS , LS, · · · ). Following the
notation developed before and in the proof of Lemma 2.11, let q = Cs,e ∩ (Cs)0
and q′ = Cs,e ∩ (Cs)1. Consider the case where q and q′ are the two nodes of
Cs in Cs,e(= (Cs)e). The proof for other cases are similar. As both q and q′
are Gm-unbalanced, and because (ξS, ǫS) is a Γ-framed MSP ﬁeld, q and q′

16

HUAI-LIANG CHANG, JUN LI, WEI-PING LI, AND CHIU-CHU MELISSA LIU

extend to S-families of nodes QS, Q′S ⊂ CS containing q and q′ respectively,
which decompose CS along QS and Q′S into two families of curves, one of which
is a family of rational curves CS,e indexed by e ∈ E0(Γ) with two sections
QS and Q′S ⊂ CS,e. By shrinking S with s ∈ S if necessary, we can ﬁnd an
S-isomorphism φ : P1 × S ∼= CS,e so that φ−1(QS ) = [1, 0] × S and φ−1(Q′S ) =
[0, 1]×S. We then ﬁx an isomorphism φ∗LS|CS,e
P1(de), and, by Lemma
2.11, express

∼= π∗P1 O

(2.14)

φ∗ϕi,S|CS,e = cixde, φ∗ν1,S|CS,e = cyde ,

where ci, c are regular functions on S so that (c1, · · · , c5) and c are nowhere
vanishing. The S-family (2.14) deﬁnes a morphism S → We. Clearly, diﬀerent
choices of isomorphisms φ and isomorphism φ∗LS|CS,e
P1(de) produce
another S → We that diﬀers from the previous S → We by an arrow between
them. Thus we obtain a morphism Φe(ξS, ǫS) : S → We, which patches to
form a morphism Φe : WΓ → We, as desired.
(cid:3)

∞ (Γ), and δ = 0 otherwise, set δ′ = −1 when v′ ∈ V 0,1

To study the structure of the morphism Φ, we investigate the associated
moduli of e ∈ E(Γ). Let e ∈ E∞(Γ). Recall the statement before Lemma 2.12,
let v ∈ V∞(Γ) and v′ ∈ V1(Γ) be so that (e, v) and (e, v′) ∈ F (Γ). Set δ = −1
when v ∈ V 0,1
(Γ) and
δ′ = 0 otherwise. Note that when de = d0e − d∞e 6∈ Z, δ = 0.
We introduce We. In case d∞e 6∈ Z, let (X, q, q′) = (P(5, 1), [1, 0], [0, 1]), etc.,
be as in and before Lemma 2.12. Let N = OX(−de), and let ω = OX(δ′q′) ∼=
OX(δ′). (Note δ = 0 in this case.) We deﬁne We to be the stack parameterizing
families of

where an arrow from (c1x−5de+δ′

Before proving the proposition, we state simple facts on lifting automor-
phisms of a twisted curve to their invertible sheaves. We recall notations used
in [CLLL, Subsect. 2.1] (drawn from [ACV, AF, AGV, Cad].)

First a model of an index r balanced node is

Vr :=(cid:2)Spec(cid:0)C[u, v]/(uv)(cid:1)(cid:14)µr(cid:3) ,

3By this we mean it is a weight −1 representation of µl.

ζ · (u, v) = (ζu, ζ−1v).

18

An index r marking of a twisted curve looks like the model

Invertible sheaves (representable) on the model Vr is a µr-module Mm, 0 <
m < r:

Ur :=(cid:2)Spec C[u](cid:14)µr(cid:3) ,

ζ · u = ζu.

Mm := u−(r−m)C[u] ⊕[0] v−mC[v] := ker{u−(r−m)C[u] ⊕ v−mC[v] → Cm},

where the arrow is a homomorphism of µr-modules, µr leaves 1 ∈ C[u] and
1 ∈ C[v] ﬁxed and acts on 1 ∈ Cm ∼= C via ζ ·1 = ζ m1, and both u−(r−m)C[u] →
Cm and v−mC[v] → Cm are surjective. Under this convention,
(2.18)

πr∗Mm = C[x] ⊕ C[y],

where πr is the projections to its coarse moduli space

(2.19)

πr : Vr → Vr := Spec(cid:0)C[x, y]/(xy),

and πr : Ur → Ur := Spec C[x],

x = ur, y = vr.

In the following, we will repeatedly use the fact that if we let 1u ∈ C[u] be
the element 1 ∈ C ⊂ C[u], and let 1v, 1x and 1y be similarly deﬁned elements,
then πr∗ in (2.18) sends 1u and 1v to 1x and 1y, respectively.
Note that the relative automorphism groups AutUr (Ur) ∼= {1}, AutVr (Vr) ∼=
µr, where the latter is generated by ζr · (u, v) = (u, ζ−1
r v). These groups are
useful in our study of MSP ﬁelds due to the following lifting property. We
assume r is an odd prime. We will follow the notations before and after (2.19).

Lemma 2.35. Let m ∈ [1, r − 1]. There is a unique AutVr (Vr)-linearization
of the module Mm so that it leaves 1u ∈ Mm ﬁxed.
Proof. Let α ∈ AutVr (Vr) so that α · (u, v) = (u, ζ−1
r v). To make Mm an
AutVr (Vr)-module that leaves 1u ﬁxed, we only need to ﬁnd α·1v = ζ a
r 1v so that
α acts on u−(r−m)1u and v−m1v by identical factors. Since α · (u−(r−m)1u) =
u−(r−m)1u and α·(v−m1v) = ζ m
r ζ a

As m ∈ [1, r − 1], it is uniquely solvable (mod r) by a = r − m.
(cid:3)

r 1v, they are identical if and only if 1 = ζ m

r ζ a

A simple corollary of this is that the only α ∈ AutVr (Vr) that lifts to an

automorphism Mm ﬁxing (1u, 1v) is the trivial element α = 1 ∈ AutVr (Vr).

Lemma 2.36. Let b ≥ 0 and m ∈ [1, r − 1] be integers so that (m, r) = 1,
and let l = rb + m. Given a µl-action on Vr via ζl · (x, y) = (x, ζ−1
l y) and a
µl-linearization on πr∗Mm = C[x] ⊕ C[y] via ζl · (1x, 1y) = (1x, ζ b
l 1y), there is
a unique lifting of this µl-action to Vr together with a µl-linearization of Mm
covering that of πr∗Mm.
Proof. A general extension of ζl · (x, y) = (x, ζ−1

Proof of Proposition 2.34. We follow the notation in the proof of Proposition
2.27. Let n ∈ N (Γ) and let Γ′ be the decoupling of Γ along n, We look at the
tautological morphism φ : WΓ → WΓ′ in (2.12). We will show that φ is an
isomorphism.

We ﬁrst consider the case where v ∈ V S

∞(Γ). After a moment of thought, we
see that we only need to show a simpliﬁed case where E(Γ) contains one edge
e ∈ E∞(Γ), and V (Γ) contains a stable vertex v ∈ V S
∞(Γ), and one unstable
vertex v′ ∈ V1(Γ). In this case, the morphism φ is
φ : WΓ −→ Wv × We.

When de ∈ Z, it is obvious. From now on, we assume de /∈ Z.
We prove that φ is an isomorphism of stacks. First, it is easy to see that
φ is one-one, onto and ´etale. Thus to prove the Proposition we only need to
show that for any (ξ, ǫ) ∈ WΓ, Aut((ξ, ǫ)) ∼= Aut(φ(ξ, ǫ)).

For a ∈ {v, e}, let ξa = ξ|Ca. Any ι ∈ Aut((ξ, ǫ)) induces an ιa ∈ Aut(ξa)
for every a ∈ {a, v}. We claim that if all ιa = id, then ι = id. Indeed, let
α0 ∈ Aut(C) be the image of ι in Aut(C), and let α1 and α2 be the associated
isomorphisms α0∗L → L and α0∗N → N. Assuming ιa = id for a = e and
v, then α0|Ca = α1|Ca = α2|Ca = id. Therefore, α0 induces the identity in
Aut(C). Suppose α0 6= id, then α0 ∈ AutC(C). Because ξ is representable
(cf. Deﬁnition 2.1), by Lemma 2.35, α0 can not be lifted to automorphisms of
both L and N so that their restrictions over the scheme part of C are identities.
Therefore, α0 = id. Then, applying the uniqueness part of Lemma 2.35, we
see that α1 = α2 = id. This proves that ιe = ιv = id imply ι = id.

We now prove the converse: If {κe, κv} ∈ Aut(φ((ξ, ǫ))), then we can ﬁnd
an ι ∈ Aut((ξ, ǫ)) so that ιe = κe and ιv = κv. Clearly, it suﬃces to show that
this is true when one of {κe, κv} is trivial.

We ﬁrst look at the case when κe 6= id. Let q = Ce ∩ Cv and q′ = Cv′, viewed
as a point in Ce. Let αe0 ∈ Aut(Ce) be its induced automorphism, which leaves
q and q′ ﬁxed. Let

αe1 : αe0∗L|Ce → L|Ce

and αe2 : αe0∗N|Ce → N|Ce

(2.20)
be the associated isomorphisms. Since d∞e 6∈ Z, near q, we can apply Remark
2.33 and Lemma 2.36 to conclude that we can extend αe0 to an automorphism
αve0 of Cev := Ce ∪Cv, and extend αe1 and αe2 to αev1 and αev2, like (2.20) with
v replaced by ve. so that ιev = {αevi} becomes an automorphism of (ξ, ǫ)|Cev
witht ιev|Cv = id. Because of this, and because αe1|q′ = αe2|q′ = id, we can
further extend ιev to an automorphism ι of (ξ, ǫ).

At last, we consider the case where κv 6= id but κe = id. We claim that we
can extend κv to a κve ∈ Aut((ξ, ǫ)|Cve ) so that κve|Ce = id. Let (αv0, αv1, αv2)

20

v

be as before; note that since de /∈ Z, q = Cv ∩ Ce is a stack point. Without
loss of generality, we can assume that there is an αv0-invariant ´etale chart
Uv = [U′v/µ5] → Cv so that αv0|Uv lifts to α′v0 : U′v → U′v, and that there is
an ˜x ∈ Γ(OU ′
v ) so that ζ5 · ˜x = ζ5 ˜x and q = [(˜x = 0)/µ5]. Because ρ|Cv is
∼= ˜x−(5−m)C[˜x], for an m ∈ [1, 4],
nowhere vanishing, we can assume that L|U ′
v = (˜x−(5−m)1)5. Since ρ is invariant under κv, ¯αv1 : = αv1 ◦ α∗v0
so that ρ|U ′
ﬁxes (˜x−(5−m)1)5. Thus there is a c ∈ [0, 4] so that ¯αv1 sends ˜x−(5−m)1 to
5 ˜x−(5−m)1.
ζ c
Now let αve0 be an extension of αv0 to Cv ∪ Ce so that αve0|Ce = id. By an
argument similar to the proof of Lemma 2.35, we can extend αv1 to an αve1 :
5 ˜x−(5−m)1, by the proof
αve0∗L|Cve → L|Cve. Because ¯αv1 sends ˜x−(5−m)1 to ζ c
of the same Lemma, we see that there is a c′ ∈ [0, 4] so that αve1|Ce = ζ c′

When c′ = 0, we are done. Otherwise, we apply Lemma 2.35 to pick a
τ ∈ AutCve(Cve) so that it lifts to an action τ (the same letter for simplicity)
on L|Cve so that τ |Cv = id and τ |Ce = ζ−c′
id. Let βve0 = τ ◦ αve0. Then βve0
lifts to a βve1 : βve0∗L|Cve → LCve so that βve1|Cv = αv1 and βve1|Ce = id. As
to N, αv2 extends to βve2 that is αv2 and id when restricted to Cv and Ce,
respectively. Because the ﬁeld ϕ vanishes along q, we see that (ϕ, ρ, ν1, ν2)|Cve
are invariant under κve := (βve0, βve1, βve2).

Therefore, applying the previous arguments, we conclude that we can extend

the T -invariant part of the perfect obstruction theory induces a perfect ob-
struction theory of the ﬁxed locus W T with the obstruction sheaf (ObW |W T )T
and the cosection (the invariant part of σ)

σT : ObW T := (ObW |W T )T −→ OW T .

Let `a∈Λ Wa = W T be a decomposition into disjoint open and closed sub-

stacks, let σa = σT |Wa. Let D(σ) be the degeneracy (non-surjective) part of
σ, let ιa : D(σa) → D(σ) be the inclusion, and let

The following virtual localization of cosection localized virtual cycles (analo-
gous to [GP]) is addressed in [CKL].

Theorem 3.1 (Virtual localization formula). Let the notations be as stated.
Suppose each moving part (EW |Wa)mv is quasi-isomorphic to a T -equivariant

mula, we ﬁrst lift a T -equivariant relative obstruction theory of W(= Wg,γ,d)
to a T -equivariant perfect obstruction theory of W.

We recall the relevant notations. Recall that D is the stack of (C, ΣC, L, N).

By forgetting (ϕ, ρ, ν), we get the forgetful morphism q : W → D. Let

(CW , ΣCW , L, N , ϕ, ρ, ν)

and π : CW −→ W

be the universal family of W. Following [CLLL], we have the relative perfect
obstruction theory

σW to be this lift, which is T -equivariant since σW/D is. Thus the T -equivariant

To apply virtual localization, we need to verify that for W(Γ) ⊂ W, which
is the image of ιΓ : WΓ → W (cf. Proposition 2.24), we can ﬁnd a two-term
complex of locally free sheaves [F(Γ),0 → F(Γ),1] on [W(Γ)/T ] so that the moving

First, as W(Γ) ⊂ W T is an open and closed substack, we have the direct sum
decomposition as complexes of quasi-coherent sheaves on [W(Γ)/T ]:

(3.6)

EW|W(Γ) =Mk

(EW|W(Γ))(k),

where the superscript (k) means the corresponding weight k part.

Since EW|W(Γ) is a complex of sheaves of OWΓ-modules with coherent coho-
mologies, the same is true for all (EW |W(Γ))(k). By the explicit description of
WΓ, it is direct to check that WΓ has the resolution property and its coarse
moduli is projective. Since WΓ → W(Γ) is a ﬁnite quotient, the same is true
for W(Γ). Thus applying [Kr2, Prop 5.1] and [Huy, Prop 3.5 and Lem 3.6], and
using that for any closed ξ ∈ W(Γ), H i(EW |ξ) = 0 for i 6∈ [0, 1], we conclude
that each (EW |W(Γ))(k) ⊗ L−k is quasi-isomorphic to a two-term complex of
ﬁnite rank locally free sheaves of amplitude [−1, 0] on W(Γ). Finally, since
EW|W(Γ) has coherent cohomologies, all but ﬁnitely many of (EW|W(Γ))(k)’s are
quasi-isomorphic to 0. This veriﬁes the requirement to apply Theorem 3.1.
Following the convention, we agree

Lemma 3.7. The tautological map q∗ΓTDΓ → (ι∗Γq∗TD)T is an isomorphism in
the derived category D+

qcoh(OWΓ ).

Proof. For notational simplicity, we study a simpler problem. Let D′ be the
stack of triples (ΣC, C, L) of pointed twisted curves with invertible sheaves, let
D′T be the stack of T -equivariant such triples (ΣC, C, L), and let ζ′ : D′T → D′
be the forgetful morphism, forgetting the T -equivariant structure. Then a
simple argument shows that the Lemma follows from the claim that ζ′∗TD′

is canonically a T -complex, and the tautological map TD′
through a T -equivariant isomorphism

∼=−→ (ζ′∗TD′)T .

To prove the claim, we transform a triple (ΣC, C, L) to a C∗-pair R ⊂ S:

S = PC(L ⊕ 1), R = S ×C ΣC ⊂ S and t · [a, 1] = [ta, 1], t ∈ C∗.

∼= ST . Thus we have induced isomorphisms TD′ ∼= TS and TD′

Let S be the stack of such C∗-pairs R ⊂ S. Then the mentioned construction
deﬁnes an equivalence of stacks D′ ∼= S. Furthermore, if we let ST be the
stack of T -equivariant C∗-pairs in S, then we have an equivalence of stacks
∼= TST . Let
D′T
η : ST → S be the forgetful morphism. Since η∗TS has a canonical T -action,
∼= ζ′∗TD′ provides the latter a T -action. Furthermore,
the isomorphism η∗TS
as TST → η∗TS factors through an isomorphism TST → (η∗TS )T , TD′
→
ζ′∗TD′ factors through a T -equivariant isomorphism (3.11). This proves the
lemma.

We need a few lemmas before proving Proposition 3.5. Let a ∈ N (Γ)∗ and
let Γ′ be the decoupling of Γ along a. Let φ : WΓ → WΓ′ be the isomorphism
stated in (2.12). Let S be any scheme and let ξ ∈ WΓ(S) be any family with
π : C → S its domain and L, N its associated sheaves. Let ξ′ ∈ WΓ′(S) be
the image of ξ under φ, of domain π′ : C′ → S and sheaves L′ and N ′. Note
that C′ is derived from C by partial resolution along the S-family of nodes
Qa ⊂ C. (Namely, there is an canonical ﬁnite S-morphism η : C′ → C that
is an isomorphism away from η−1(Qa), and η−1(Qa) → Q is a two-to-one
morphism.)

As in (3.2), we set

Llog = L(−ΣC(1,ϕ))

and P log = L∨⊗5 ⊗ ωlog

C/S(−ΣC(1,ρ)).

And same for L′ log and P′ log on C′.
Lemma 3.8. Let the notations be as stated. Then we have

(1) a quasi-isomorphism: (Rπ∗Llog)T ∼= (Rπ′∗L′ log)T ;

(2) a distinguished triangle:
(Rπ∗P log)T −→ (Rπ′

∗P′ log)T −→ (Rπ∗(P log|Qa))T +1−→ .
Proof. We ﬁrst prove the case where a = (e, v) such that v ∈ V S
∞(Γ). Let
η : C′ → S be the tautological morphism as before. Using that the two
new markings of C′ are both labeled by (1, ϕ), we have the tautological exact
sequence of OC-modules:

0 −→ P log −→ η∗(P′ log) −→ P log|Qa −→ 0.

Applying Rπ∗ we obtain (2).
We now prove (1) in this case. Without loss of generality, we can assume Γ
is connected. In case Γ′ is connected, let a′ = (e, v′) ∈ N (Γ′), where v′ ∈ V1(Γ)
is the other vertex attached to e. Let Qa′ ⊂ C′ be the associated S-family of
nodes, and decompose Γ′ along Qa′ to obtain C′′ ∪ Ce, which is a disjoint union
of two S-families of connected curves, indexed like before.

In case Γ′ is disconnected, let Γ′ = Γ′′ ∪ |e|, where |e| is the connected
component containing the edge e. We decompose C′ = C′′ ∪ Ce into S-families
of connected curves, accordingly. We agree Qa′ = ∅ in this case.

In either case, both C′′ and Ce are S-subfamilies of C. Let ι : C′′ → C and
ι′ : C′′ → C′ be the tautological embeddings. Then we have the obvious exact
sequence of OC-modules

0 −→ ι∗(L′′ log(−Qa′)) −→ Llog −→ Llog|Ce −→ 0,

and the obvious exact sequence of OC′-modules

0 −→ ι′

∗(L′′ log(−Qa′)) −→ L′ log −→ L′ log|Ce −→ 0.

H 1(Llog|Ce) = H 1(L|Ce) = H 0(L∨|Ce ⊗ ωCe(Qa)(−Qa))∨.

Here we used the fact that one of the two new markings in C′′ is labeled by
(1, ϕ) and the other labeled by (1, ρ). We claim Rπ∗(Llog|Ce) = 0. In fat, we
ﬁrst prove the case where S is a point. As Llog|Ce = L|Ce has negative degree,
we have H 0(Llog|Ce) = 0. We then use Serre-duality
Since T acts on (cid:0)L∨|Ce ⊗ ωCe(Qa)(cid:1)|Qa trivially, we obtain H i(Llog|Ce )T = 0,
by Lemma 2.3. Therefore, applying base change property, we have proven the
claim Rπ∗(Llog|Ce ) = 0. Thus we get (1).
∞ (Γ) is the same. The case v ∈ V1(Γ) is simpler, using that
since the T -action on L|Qa is via scaling by t, we have (Rπ∗(Llog|Qa))T and
(Rπ∗(P log|Qa))T are quasi-isomorphic to 0.

We continue to denote by Γ′ the decoupling of Γ along a ∈ N (Γ)∗. We look

Lemma 3.9. We have the identity φ∗[WΓ′]vir

Proof. As before, we let (CΓ, LΓ, LΓ, NΓ, . . .) with πΓ : CΓ → WΓ be the uni-

Let DΓ be the stack of Γ-framed curves deﬁned in and after Deﬁnition

with the forgetful DΓ → DT gives us the forgetful WΓ → DT . We comment
that DΓ → DT is ´etale.

(3.16)

Given a Γ-framed curve (C, ΣC, L, N), following Deﬁnition 2.25, C has a disgin-
guished (T -unbalanced) node qa, and the two branches of qa are also labeled
by data in Γ. Let π : C′ → C be the partial normalization of C along qa (and
qa only), and let ΣC′
= π−1(ΣC) ∪ π−1(qa), where we label points π−1(ΣC) by
the legs of Γ′ that come from legs in Γ and label the two points in π−1(qa)
according to which branch its image (under π) lies in. As T -unbalanced nodes
remain nodes in any family of T -equivariant curves, this association deﬁnes a
morphism DΓ → DΓ′ that ﬁts into the commutative square (3.16).

Without lose of generality, we can assume Γ is connected. Then Γ′ either is
connected or has two connected components. We ﬁrst consider the case where
Γ′ is connected. Then the lower horizontal line in (3.16) is a (C∗)2-torsor,

We claim that α is an isomorphism. Indeed, by the discussion after (3.15),

(3.16), we conclude that

coker H 0(γ1) ∼= coker H 0(γ2)

and

ker H 1(γ1) ∼= ker H 1(γ2).

This implies that α is an isomorphism.

Finally, we check that the T -invariant cosection σW of the obstruction sheaf
of W lifts to a cosection σΓ of the obstruction sheaf of WΓ, identical to that
using the formula (2.9) in [CLLL]. Let σΓ′ be the cosection of the obstruction
sheaf of WΓ′, deﬁned similarly. Then it is straightforward to see that σΓ and
σΓ′ are consistent under α.

Since TDΓ/DΓ′ is a locally free sheaf,

h1/h0(EWΓ/DΓ)

h1/h0(γ1)

−−−−−−→ h1/h0(EWΓ′ /DΓ′ )

is a smooth quotient. Adding the commutative diagram above, we conclude
that the intrinsic normal cone CWΓ/DΓ is the pullback of the intrinsic normal
cone CWΓ′ /DΓ′ . Therefore, by the comparison of the two cosections σΓ and σΓ′,
we prove the proposition.

are T -vector spaces. As T acts on the ﬁelds via t · (ϕ, ρ, ν1, ν2) = (ϕ, ρ, tν1, ν2),
the vector space H i(V) as T -vector space is

5. Effective relations among GW and FJRW of quintics

We will show that for a regular graph Γ ∈ ∆reg, the contributions to [WΓ]vir
loc
from vertices in V S
∞(Γ) are twisted FJRW invariants, and those from vertices
in V S
0 (Γ) are GW invariants of the quintic. We then investigate the relations
obtained from MSP ﬁeld theory between GW invariants of the quintic threefold
and FJRW invariants of ([C5/Z5], w5).
5.1. FJRW invariants of ([C5/Z5], w5). This class of FJRW invariants was
constructed in [PV, Chi, Mo, FJR2]. We will follow its latter construction
using the cosection localized virtual cycles [CLL].

Let (Gm)5 act on C5 by the standard product action, and let G5 ≤ (Gm)5
be generated by (ζ5, ζ5, ζ5, ζ5, ζ5). Let γ = (γ1, · · · , γℓ) ∈ (µ×5 )ℓ, where µ×5 =
µ5 − {1}. A γ-pointed genus-g G5-spin curve is a stable genus g ℓ-pointed
twisted nodal curve with line bundles L1, · · · , L5 and isomorphisms

φ0 : L5
1

∼= ωlog

C

and φi : L−1

i ⊗ Li+1 ∼= OC
(5.1)
such that the monodromy of Li along ΣC
is γi. The reason that the rela-
i
tions take this form is that the group of G5-invariant Laurent monomials in
(x1, · · · , x5) is generated by x5
i xi+1’s. Note the relations (5.1) are
equivalent to

1 and x−1

L := L1 ∼= · · · ∼= L5

and L⊗5 ∼= ωlog
C .

We form the category whose objects are ﬂat families of stable genus-g γ-
pointed G5-spin curves, and arrows between them are arrows of the curves
together with isomorphisms of the line bundles that commute with the φi’s. It
is a smooth, proper DM stack, which we denote by Mg,γ(G5).

The (narrow) FJRW invariants of ([C5/Z5], w5) is deﬁned via the cosection

localized virtual cycle

where the former sends (cid:0)C, ΣC, L, ϕ1, · · · , ϕ5(cid:1) to (cid:0)C, ΣC, (L, ϕ1), · · · , (L, ϕ5)(cid:1).

(5.3) and (5.6) vanish unless all γi ∈ {ζ5, ζ 2

We now use Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula to express (5.6) in terms
1/5
of Θg,k. We ﬁrst calculate the Chern character of Rπ∗(L∨) over M
g,γ . Follow-
ing the notations introduced in [Chi, Theo 1.1.1], let Υ be the stack of objects
1/5
(ΣC, C, L, z, Uz), where (ΣC, C, L) ∈ M
g,γ , z is a node of C, and Uz is a branch
of the formal completion ˆCz of C at z. Clearly, Υ is a smooth DM-stack.

Let ψz ∈ A1Υ be the ﬁrst Chern class (the ψ class) of the relative tangent
bundle (i.e. Tz Uz) of the distinguished branch along the distinguished node
of the universal family of Υ. Let ¯ψz to be the coarse moduli analogue of ψz.
Namely, let ¯Uz be the coarse moduli of Uz, then ¯ψz is the ﬁrst Chern class of
the family of Tz ¯Uz, the cotangent line bundle after taking the coarse moduli of
the distinguished marking. (Thus ¯ψz equals 5ψz when the node is non-scheme,
and equals ψz otherwise.)

We ﬁrst recall its setuuf. Following [Chi, Deﬁnition 2.1.1], a 5-stable ℓ-pointed
curve (A, x1, · · · , xℓ) is an ℓ-pointed twisted nodal curve with all of its markings
being scheme points, all of its nodes being µ5 balanced, and its automorphisms
group being ﬁnite. Following [Chi, Theorem 2.2.1], we form the groupoid N
of (A, xi, S), where (A, xi) is a 5-stable ℓ-pointed curve, and S is an invertible
sheave on A so that S⊗5 ∼= (ωlog
i=1(5 − mi)xi)). The stack N is a
smooth proper DM stack. Let ˆπ : A → N , X1, · · · , Xℓ ⊂ A and S be the
universal family of N , which comes with the isomorphism

Thus the family ( ¯C, ¯Σi, ¯S) would induce a morphism N → M should ¯S be
representable along all nodes of the base curves.

To remedy this, to each (A, xi, S) ∈ N , let ˆA be the twisted curve obtained
from A by forgetting the stakcy structure at every node of A where S has trivial
monodromy, and let ζ : A → ˆA be the obvious morphism. Then ( ˆA, xi, ζ∗S) ∼=
(¯C, Σ¯C

We continue to recall the notations in [Chi, page 3]. Like the case for
Υ → M, let Υ′ = ∪4
k=0Υ′k be the smooth DM stack of objects (A, xi, S, z, Uz),
where (A, xi, S) ∈ N , and (z, Uz) is the pair of a node and a branch of A. Here

˜ψi = f∗ ¯ψi, ˜ψz = λ∗k
¯ψz, where λk : Υ′k → Υk is deﬁned similar to that of
f : N → M. ˜κk is the standard κ-class of N .

Applying f∗ to the above formula, one checks that the ﬁrst two terms on

as desired.

In case k = 0, λ0 is generically a µ5-gerbe (c.f. [Chi, Def 2.1.1], [ACV, Thm.

f∗j0∗(cid:16)(− ˜ψ)iσ∗( ˜ψ)j(cid:17) = 0∗λ0∗λ∗0(cid:16)(− ¯ψ)iσ∗( ¯ψ)j(cid:17) =

We need the following simple fact.

Lemma 5.6. The moduli M

smooth DM-stacks M0 and M1, characterized by that (ΣC, C, L) ∈ M0 (resp.

(5.9)

loc = −45[M0] + [M1].

Proof. By the assumption on the monodromy, L(−ΣC) has trivial monodromy

along ΣC, and L(−ΣC)⊗5 ∼= OC. Thus M
1,ζ5 is isomorphic to the moduli of
(C, Σ, L′) so that (C, Σ) is a one-pointed genus 1 twisted curve and L′⊗5 ∼= OC .
This gives M

1,ζ5 = M0 ∪ M1 (cf. [AJ]).

c = −45.

expect that an analogue of the L-twisted FJRW invariants of ([C/Z5], x5) (cf.
[CZ]) exists for the dual-twisted FJRW invariants of the quintic singularity.

Remark 5.10. Using string and dilaton equations, (5.12) can be calculated
knowing the GW invariants of quintics Ng,d.

5.3. FJRW invariants lead to GW-invariants. In this subsection we use
MSP moduli spaces to produce an algorithm calculating the GW invariants of
the quintic from the FJRW invariants.

Theorem 5.11. Let g ≥ 1, d ≥ 1 be such that d + 1 − g > 0. Then the
vanishing (1.2) produces a relation evaluating Ng,d, provided the followingz are
known:

(1) Ng′,d′ for g′ ≤ g and d′ ≤ d − 1, and
(2) Θg,k for k ≤ 2g − 2 and Θg′,k for g′ ≤ g − 1, k ≤ 2g − 4.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove the case g ≥ 2. Choose d = (d, 0) and ℓ = 0, and
consider the moduli of stable MSP ﬁelds Wg,d of numerical data (g, ∅, d). We
apply the vanishing (1.2) to the equivariant cycle [Wg,d]vir

Contr(Γ), Contr(Γ) =htδ(g,d) ·

For Γ ∈ ∆reg
g,d, applying Proposition 3.5 we see that Contr(Γ) is a polynomial
expression in terms of the twisted GW of Q5 and the dual-twisted FJRW invari-
ants of ([C5/Z5], w5). By the previous subsections, they can all be expressed
in terms of Ng′,d′ and Θg′,k′.

We now investigate possible Ng′,d′ and Θg′,k′ that appear in Contr(Γ). By
Proposition 3.5 and the previous discussion, we see that each v ∈ V S
0 (Γ) con-
tributes an entry Ngv,dv in Contr(Γ), and each v ∈ V S
∞(Γ) contributes an entry
Θgv,kv in Contr(Γ), where kv is the number of e ∈ Ev so that the monodromy
of L|Cv along y(e,v) = Ce ∩ Cv is ζ 2
5 .

We ﬁrst show that if Ng′,d′ appears in Contr(Γ), then g′ ≤ g and d′ ≤ d,
and if Ng,d appears in Contr(Γ), then Γ is a one vertex graph. Indeed, because

the MSP ﬁelds all have domain curves genus g, and g =Pv∈V S(Γ) gv + h1(Γ),
we have gv ≤ g for all v ∈ V S(Γ). Furthermore when gv = g for one v ∈ V0
then all other gv′ = 0 and h1(Γ) = 0. For the degree bound, we recall that (cf.
[CLLL]) by the non-vanishing properties of ν1 and ν2, both N ⊗ L|C1∪C1∞∪C∞
and N|C0∪C01∪C1 are trivial line bundles. Thus using deg N = d∞ = 0, we

50

get deg L|C0∪C01 = d0 = d. Because deg L|Ce > 0 for every e ∈ E0(Γ), we
have dv = deg L|Cv ≤ d. Finally, suppose Ng′,d appears in Contr(Γ), then
E0(Γ) = ∅ and V S
0 (Γ) 6= ∅. Since Γ is connected and regular, Γ must be a
single vertex graph, say {v} = V S
0 (Γ), and then gv = g. For such graph, we
have Contr(Γ) = Ng,d. This proves (1).

We now look at the possible Θg′,k′ appearing in Contr(Γ). For v ∈ V∞(Γ),

we adopt the convention that

other calculable terms. This proves the case g ≥ 2.

In case g = 1, a similar argument, using Proposition 5.7, shows that we can
determine all N1,d, knowing the terms speciﬁed in the theorem. This proves
the theorem.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.12. For g = 2, to run this algorithm we need to know N2,1 and
Θ2,2. As N2,1 is classical, only Θ2,2 is unknown. Similarly, for g = 3 we only
need Θ2,2 and Θ3,4 since N3,1 and N3,2 are classical. (Recall that Θg,k = 0
unless k + 2 − 2g ≡ 0(5).)

5.4. Algorithm for FJRW invariants. We pick d so that d + 1 − g > 0 and
let d = (0, d), then it is easy to see that no GW invariants Nd′,g′ appears in the
polynomial relation from the vanishing (1.2) for (g, γ = ∅, d). This provides
relations among FJRW invariants Θg′,k′.

Theorem 5.13. For ﬁxed g ≥ 1, and k ≥ 7g − 2, the vanishings (1.2) using
(g, γ, d) = (g, ∅, (0, d)) (for some d > g − 1) evaluate Θg,k inductively from the
datum {Θg′,k′}g′<g,k′≤k and {Θg,k′}k′<7g−2.
Proof. We calculate Θg,k for k ≥ 7g − 2. As Θg,k = 0 unless 5 | k − 7g + 2,
we only need to examin when k = 7g − 2 + 5m, m ≥ 0. Pick d = g + m and
let d = (0, d). Applying the vanishing (1.2) to cycle [Wg,d]vir
loc, as (5.14), we
obtain

Contr(Γ) = 0.

XΓ∈∆reg

g,d

For each Γ ∈ ∆reg
g,d, Contr(Γ) is a polynomial expression in terms of a collection
of Ng′,d′ and Θg′,k′. Since N⊗ L|C1∪C1∞∪C∞ and N|C0∪C01∪C1 are trivial, we have
deg L|C0∪C01 = d0. As the degree of L is nonnegative on each component of
C0 and positive on each component of C01, the assumption d0 = 0 implies
V0(Γ) = E0(Γ) = ∅. Therefore no Ng′,d′ occurs.

As argued before, only Θg′≤g,k′ can possibly appear in Contr(Γ). We look at
possible Θg,k′ appearing in it. Following the notation in the proof of Theorem
5.11, we get

This gives the bound kv ≤ k.

Next we consider the case when there is a v ∈ V S

∞(Γ) so that gv = g. Then
all other v′ ∈ V S
∞(Γ) has gv′ = 0. Therefore the above inequality implies
kv ≤ 7g − 2 + 5m = k. Now assume the equality holds, i.e., kv = 7g − 2 + 5m.
From (5.15), we have deg N|C[v] > 0 for v ∈ Vexc(Γ). We obviously also have
deg N|C[v] > 0 for v ∈ V U
∞(Γ). Since all inequalities in the formula (5.16)
become equality, we have V S(Γ) = V S

5.6. Conjectural algorithm. Our goal is to determine the set of all quintic
GW invariants {Ng,d}g,d and the FJRW invariants {Θg,k}g,k. As all genus zero
invariants {N0,d, Θ0,d}d are known by [Gi, LLY, CR], we only need to ﬁnd
algorithms to determine all positive genus invariants. Inductively, suppose we
have algorithms determining all Ng′<g,d and Θg′<g,k, Theorem 5.11 shows that
to determine all genus g invariants we only need to ﬁnd additional algorithms
to determine the sets {Ng,d}d≤g−1 and {Θg,k}k<2g−2. Together, we need to
determine the following two types of initial datum

(5.17)

I1 = {Ng,d | d < g}

and I2 = {Θg,k | k < 7g − 2}

For the set I1, say for d < g, let d = (d + 1, g − d − 1) and γ = ∅.

Conjecture 5.15. For d < g, using the mentioned (g, γ, d) and applying the
vanishin in (1.2), we can determine Ng,d provided

(1) Ng′,d′ are known for g′ < g, d′ ≤ d, and
(2) Θg′,k′ are known for g′ ≤ g, k′ < 7g′ − 2.

Note that Conjecture 5.15 implies Conjecture 1.3 via Theorem 5.11. Suppose
Conjecture 5.15 is conﬁrmed, we are left to determine I2. To this end, we
propose to use non-tivial γ. Speciﬁcally, we let ℓ > 0 and consider γ = ((1, ρ)ℓ),
with ℓ markings labeled by (1, ρ). (We abbreviate it to γ = (ρℓ).) For positive
k so that d = (k + 2 − 2g)/5 ∈ Z but d + 1 − g ≤ 0, we pick ℓ ≥ 0 so that

vir. dim Wg,ρℓ,(0,dk) = ℓ + d + 1 − g = 1 > 0.

We then apply the vanishing (1.2) to the moduli Wg,(ρℓ),(0,d). As d0 = 0, this
vanishing provides a polynomial relation among {Θg′≤g,k′}.
Like before, among all Θg,k′ appearing in this polynomial relation, the largest
possible k′ is Θg,k, and it appears in the form eg,kΘg,k, where eg,k is a scalar.
If eg,k 6= 0, then we can evaluate Θg,k using this relation. This proves

Proposition 5.16. Let the notation as stated. Then in case eg,k 6= 0, the
stated algorithm evaluates Θg,k based on {Θg′,k′}g′<g,k′≤k, and {Θg,k′}k′<k
Conjecture 5.17. The constant eg,k 6= 0.

Though the coeﬃcient eg,k theoretically is calculable, it is quite involved. For
the case g = 1 and k = 0, we veriﬁed that e1,0 6= 0, and using this we calculated

loc. This number together with the algorithm in Theorem 5.11
deg[M
calculates the quintic’s GW N1,1 = 2875
(cf. the previous subsection). We also
12
conﬁrmed that e2,2 6= 0.

1/5,5p
1,ζ5

We end this subsection with a simple observation. In [BCOV, HKQ], as-
suming the mirror symmetry for all genus and using “holomorphic anomaly

equation”, the genus g GW generating function Fg = P Ng,dqd can be deter-

mined based on the ﬁrst 3g − 2 many Ng,d’s. Later, using the gap condition at

GW AND FJRW INVARIANTS OF QUINTIC CALABI-YAU MANIFOLDS

55

the conifold expansion and the monodromy at the orbifold expansion, [HKQ,
Sect 3.6] further reduced the number of unknowns to [ 2g−2

].

5

In our approach, granting Conjecture 5.15, the number of initial data needed
to determine Fg are the FJRW invariants Θg,k≤2g−2, subject to 2g − 2 ≡ k(5).
Thus [ 2(g−1)
] + 1 many FJRW invariants are needed to determine Ng,d via
MSP moduli, provided all lower genus invariants are known.

5.7. Witten’s GLSM theory. In [Wi], Witten introduced a family of theo-
ries using path integrals, the Gauged Linear Sigma Model (GLSM), linking a
sigma model targeting a Calabi-Yau hypersurface to a sigma model targeting
a Landau-Ginzburg space. The GLSM is parameterized by a complex (phase)
parameter t = ir + θ
2π , where r is the coeﬃcient of the “Fayet-Iliopoulos D
term”, and θ is called theta-angle (c.f.
[Wi, page 12 and (2.28)]). Witten
postulated that the GLSM specializes to GW path integral when r approaches
inﬁnity, and specializes to LG model path integral when r approaches negative
inﬁnity. This is the CY/LG correspondence commonly referred to.

Our Mixed-Spin-P ﬁelds (MSP ﬁelds) is a ﬁeld version of “phase space tran-
sition”. An MSP ﬁeld is an interpolation between ﬁelds valued in KP4 and
ﬁelds valued in [C5/Z5]. The interpolation is governed by the “ν ﬁeld”. Over
the part of worldsheet (curve) where ν = 0, the MSP ﬁeld is a pure ﬁeld taking
values in KP4, and over ν = ∞ the MSP ﬁeld is a pure ﬁeld taking values in
[C5/Z5]. By replacing the phase parameter by a ﬁeld, we transform Witten’s
family of CY/LG correspondence into a single ﬁeld theory. In this sense, the
ﬁeld ν is our attempt to “quantize” Witten’s parameter t = ir + θ
2π in his
vision of Calabi-Yau/Landau/Ginzberg correspondence.

5.8. Comparing with other approaches. The other approach to Witten’s
proposal is to develop a general theory of GLSM (gauged linear σ-model). The
work of Fan, Jarvis and Ruan [FJR3] worked out this theory in narrow case,
using cosection localized virtual cycle technique. The work of Tian and Xu
[TX1, TX2] are to develop an analytic theory of broad GLSM theory.

In [FJR3, Example 4.2.23], a special case of GLSM theory was exhibited,
where a closed point of this moduli space consists of a pointed twisted curve
Σ ⊂ C, two line bundles L and N, and a collection of sections. Though this
is kind of similar to the MSP ﬁelds introduced in [CLLL] and studied in the
current paper, the [FJR3, Example 4.2.23] and the theory of MSP ﬁelds are
diﬀerent.

Speciﬁcally, for the ǫ = 0+ moduli space in [FJR3, Example 4.2.23], (the
case for GW-theory is when ǫ = +∞, yet to be constructed,) the stability (of
a point (C, L, N, · · · )) requires that L−e1 ⊗ N−e2 (0 < e1 < e2) is ample on
components of C of which ωlog
C has degree zero. We show that there are stable
MSP ﬁelds which are not ǫ = 0+ stable. For example, the graph in Figure 3
has an edge connecting a genus 1 curve with a genus zero curve; an MSP ﬁeld
whose graph is as in Figure 3 will have an irreducible component E satisfying

deg(ωlog
Such MSP ﬁelds will not be in the ǫ = 0+ moduli space of [FJR3, Ex.4.2.23].

C |E) = 0, N|E ∼= O and deg(L|E) = 1, thus deg(cid:0)(L−e1 ⊗ N−e2)|E(cid:1) < 0.
