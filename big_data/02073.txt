1 Introduction

The Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) [1] is a high
precision general-purpose detector designed for high lu-
minosity e+e− collisions in the τ -charm energy region at
the Beijing Electron and Positron Collider II (BEPCII)
[2]. The current BESIII ETOF detector consists of 248
fast scintillators (BC204) readout with ﬁne-mesh photo-
multiplier tubes (Hamamatsu R5924) [3], the time reso-
lution measured is 138 ps for π (1GeV/c)). The current
ETOF modules and schematics of BESIII are shown in
Fig.1. The secondary particles created from the multi-
ple scatterings upon the materials between MDC endcap
and ETOF lead to a high multi-hits rate (per channel),
especially for electron events ( 71.5%), which lead to de-
teriorate time resolution [5].

The proposal is approved to upgrade the current BE-
SIII ETOF with the MRPC technology, aiming at an
overall time resolution of 80 ps for MIPs. The beam
tests for the MRPC prototype, together with the FEE
and time digitizer (TDIG) boards, are performed at the
BEPC E3 line. A time resolution of better than 50 ps
can be obtained, illustrated in Ref. [6][7][8], which verify
the physical design of new ETOF.

Fig. 1. Schematics of BESIII ETOF

In the project design, each ETOF ring has 36 overlap-
ping MRPCs, as shown in Fig.2. They are separated into
2 tiers with 18 MRPC modules in each. Each MRPC
module was equiped with 12 double-end readout strips,
which results in higher granularity compare to the cur-
rent ETOF. The thickness of each gas box is less than
25 mm according to the space limitation. More details
about the MRPC module can be found in Ref. [9].

2 Readout electronics and data acquisi-

tion system

The readout electronics is mainly composed of the
FEEs, 9U VME and NIM crate, together with the
data acquisition system. The FEE makes use of the
NINO chip developed by the ALICE-TOF group [10].
Each FEE module features 24 diﬀerential input chan-
nels and outputs correspondent LVDS signal with the
signal charge encoded in its width. The timing accuracy
RMS can be better than 15 ps for each channel when
the input charge is larger than 100 fC [11]. The FEE
board is ﬁxed on the surface of the aluminum gas box
which contains the MRPC module in order to reduce
the input capacitance. A ﬂexible printed circuit is de-
signed to connect the MRPC module output with proper
impedance (54 ohm). The connector (QSS-025-01-L-D-
A-K and QSS-025-02-L-D-RA-MTI) with 86 pins and the
shielded diﬀerential cable are used to connect the FEE
and the TDIG [12][13], which are aiming at reducing the
time jitter from signal transmission and ensuring the sig-
nal quality. In order to suppress the noise, the FEE are
coated with aluminum shielding boxes. The picture of
FEE and shield boxes are shown in Fig.3.

Fig. 2. Structure of BESIII ETOF ring

In this paper, we report the tests of the electron-
ics system in which The Front End Electronics (FEE)
, CLOCK, Fast control board and calibration-trigger-
threshold-power (CTTP) modules are new-designed and
ﬁrstly incorporated. In the following sections, the read-
out electronics and data acquisition system are intro-
duced. Then the tests of the electronics including param-
eter adjustment, the heat radiating, irradiation hardness,
and large-current beam are presented. The on-detector
test of the electronics and its results are described and
discussed in details. A conclusion is given at the end.

Fig. 3. The schematics of FEE board and shielding boxes

The CTTP module, which is housed in NIM crate,
provides power, threshold and test signals to the FEE.
It also receives the OR diﬀerential signals from the FEE
and produces fast trigger signals after coincidence for
charged particles identiﬁcation.

The 9U VME crate consists of the VME controller
of Power Printed Circiut (Power PC) board, the readout
control module of ROC, the clock production module,
and the TDIG module. The TDIG modules, relying on
the ASIC HPTDC chip developed by the microelectron-

ics group at CERN [14][15], focus on receiving and dig-
itizing the signals from the FEE, packing the data with
predeﬁned format and uploading them to the data ac-
quisition (DAQ) system via the VME bus. Each TDIG
board integrates 72 channels with 9 HPTDC chips oper-
ating in the high resolution mode. The TDIG picture is
shown in Fig.4.

The data acquisition system is similar to those at the
BESIII experiment, adopting the techniques of multi-
level buﬀering, parallel processing, high-speed VME

readout and network transmission. The schematic of
the readout electronics system for the ETOF upgrade
is shown in Fig.5.

Fig. 4. The picture of TDIG module

There are two separately working modes for the elec-
tronics system, namely data taking mode and calibra-
tion mode, which are determined by the ROC module
and the latter one is mainly used to guarantee whether
the system works properly. In the mode of data taking,
the ROC receives a series of control signals, such as clock,
trigger from other system at BESIII and sends them to
the module of TDIG to initialize , while in the calibra-
tion mode, the ROC generates these standard signals by
itself to clarify the system. The ROC module sends sig-
nals to the CTTP to generate the test signals and to
the TDIG to control the time measurements. Upon the
completion for the measurements, the ROC module will
produce an interrupt signal on VME bus, and then data
acquisition system will read out the data from the TDIG
module and deliver them to the computer.

3 The test of electronics system

especially for the FEE.

According to the project design, Each MRPC module
together with FEE will be mounted on the endcap EMC.
If FEE or MRPC module is needed to repair, the endcap
EMC should be ﬁrstly detached. It takes two weeks to
pull out and push in the endcap EMC, so it is impos-
sible to repair them during the data taking period. In
the endcap area, the dose rates where the FEE locates
are about 2000 rad after 10 years running of BEPCII.
The overlapping structure of detectors isn’t conducive
to FEE’s heat radiating. Based on the above points, the
reliability tests are necessary for the electronics system,

3.1 Parameter adjustment

The leading and trailing time are accurately mea-
sured relying on search window and trigger latency in
the TDIG module. The width of leading or trailing time
distribution is about 25ns due to the clock uncertainty
and the width of the signal is about 25 ns. The width
of the search window is set at 1600 ns, the same as that
of BESIII TOF used. After the parameter adjustment,
the leading and trailing time and TOT distributions are
obtained, shown in Fig.6, the few hits located outside
the signal region reﬂect the noise level.

When the readout electronics and data acquisition
system is ready, the ﬁrst data taking is done for the
calibration to check whether the electronic chain (FEE,
CTTP, cables, TDIG) worked correctly. Considering
the integral non-linearity correction of time measurement
[13], the average time resolution of electronics is about
25ps shown in Fig.7, which provide the feasibility for the
system-level time monitor in the future.

3.2 Heat radiating test

A heat radiating test of the FEE electronincs is car-
ried out. Two temperature sensors are used to detect the
temperature during the FEE working. The locations of
two sensors is shown in Fig.8: (A)near the signal collec-
tion and transmission circuit; (B)near the NINO chip in
signal handling circuit. The FEE electronics combining
with the MRPC module is put into a airtight box.

The test results is shown in the Fig.9. At the beginning
of the test, the temperature of Point B rise rapidly when
FEE starts working. After the suﬃcient heat exchang-
ing at certain time, the temperature of Point A and B
can both keep below 30 degrees required by the BESIII
experiment. On the whole, the temperature of Point A
can be 1–2 degrees higher than room temperature; the
temperature of Point B can be 4–5 degrees higher than
room temperature. During the testing time, the current
of CTTP is stable shown in Fig.9 and the FEE system
work normaly. In the future running condition, there are
dry air blowing the surface of detectors all the time, so
the working of FEE should be reliable.

3.5 The on-detector test

A on-detector test of the electronics is performed at
the BEPC E3 line using the secondary particles (e+/−,
π+/−, p, etc.)[15]. The setup of the beam test is shown
in Fig.11. The trigger is provided by the coincidence sig-
nal of two scintillators. The MRPC modules are placed
on a movable platform and the center of diﬀerent pad is
moved to the trigger region.

3.3

Irradiation hardness test

Irradiation hardness test is done with 60Co at
Academy of Military Medical Sciences. The electronics
system is exposure to radioactive source of 60Co. The
performance of electronics is studied with diﬀerent dose
rates. From the results in Fig.10, the resolution of elec-
tronics system keep steady with the dose increasing from
500 rad to 43500 rad.

Fig. 11. The setup of beam test system

The high-voltages of the MRPCs are provided by N471A
modules. The component of the MRPC working gas is
90%Freon + 5%SF6 + 5%iso-C4H10 for the test. The gas
ﬂux rate is supplied at 60 ml/min to the MRPC mod-
ules. The logic diagram of the test system is shown in
Fig.12.

Fig. 12. The module logic diagram of the test system

The ﬂight time between S1 and S2 is used to identiﬁed
pion and proton, which is shown in Fig.13. Since the
limited statistics for pions, we slected proton events for
our MRPC performance analysis.

3.4 Large-current beam test

Large-current beam test is also carried out to exam-
ine the protect circuit of FEE. The test is performed at
the BEPC E2 line using 2.5 GeV incident electron beam.
The FEE and MRPC module is put in the path of the
beam and the high voltage of MRPC is at the normal
value. The beam intensity increases from 105 electrons
to 108 electrons at a frequency of 12.5 Hz. As the beam
intensity is higher, the high voltage can not stay at nor-
mal values because the leak current of MRPC exceed the
setting value. So we increase and decrease the beam in-
tensity iteratively, keeping the hitting under normal HV
condition. Finally the test lasts about two hours, the
FEE can work normally, which indicate that the protect
circuit of FEE is reliable.

800 MeV

The time measured by the MRPC is corrected for the
slewing by iterations method [8]. The Time-TOT corre-
lation for each MRPC module are ﬁtted with the mean
time of the other two as the reference time (Tr), then

010201-5

Chinese Physics C Vol. XX, No. X (201X) XXXXXX

use the corrected time instead of primary time to be
Tr and draw a new Time-TOT distribution for each one
which will be more exact than the primary one since they
has better reference time. The time resolution of each
pad is better than 50 ps, the average eﬃciency is almost
98%, shown in Fig.14. The performance of detectors is
consistent with previous beam tests, which indicate the
electronics, including the ﬁrstly incorporated ones, meet
the project requirement.

heat radiating and large current beam tests are carried
out to prove that the electronics system, especially the
FEE, is reliable and stable. The on-detector test of the
electronics is also performed with beam at BEPCII E3
line, the time resolution less than 50 ps and the detecting
eﬃciency over 98% are obtained. These results indicate
that the electronics satisfy the design requirements, and
the whole system is ready for the mass production.
