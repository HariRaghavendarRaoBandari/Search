Abstract

We can associate local constant to every continuous ﬁnite dimensional complex representa-
tion of the absolute Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp by Deligne and
Langlands. For linear characters of F ×, Tate [31] gives an explicit formula for the abelian
local constants, but in general, there is no such explicit formula of local constant for any
arbitrary representation of a local Galois group. To give explicit formula of local constant of
a representation, we need to compute λ-functions explicitly. In this thesis we compute λK/F
explicitly, where K/F is a ﬁnite degree Galois extension of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F ,
except when K/F is a wildly ramiﬁed quadratic extension with F (cid:54)= Q2.

Then by using this λ-function computation, in general, we give an invariant formula of
local constant of ﬁnite dimensional Heisenberg representations of the absolute Galois group
GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . But for explicit invariant formula of local constant for
a Heisenberg representation, we should have information about the dimension of a Heisenberg
representation and the arithmetic description of the determinant of a Heisenberg representa-
tion. In this thesis, we give explicit arithmetic description of the determinant of Heisenberg
representation.

We also construct all Heisenberg representations of dimensions prime to p, and study their
various properties. By using λ-function computation and arithmetic description of the de-
terminant of Heisenberg representations, we give an invariant formula of local constant for a
Heisenberg representation of dimension prime to p.

Introduction

Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld (i.e., ﬁnite extension of the p-adic ﬁeld Qp, for some
prime p). Let F be an algebraic closure of F , and GF := Gal(F/F) be the absolute Galois
group of F . Let

ρ : GF → AutC(V )

be a ﬁnite dimensional continuous complex representation of the Galois group GF . For this ρ,
we can associate a constant W (ρ) with absolute value 1 by Langlands (cf. [41]) and Deligne
(cf. [37]). This constant is called the local constant (also known as local epsilon factor) of
the representation ρ. Langlands also proves that these local constants are weakly extendible
functions (cf. [31], p. 105, Theorem 1).

The existence of this local constant is proved by Tate for one-dimensional representation
in [33] and the general proof of the existence of the local constants is proved by Langlands
(see [41]). In 1972 Deligne also gave a proof using global methods in [37]. But in Deligne’s
terminology this local constant W (ρ) is D(ρ, ψF , dx, 1/2), where dx is the Haar measure on
F + (locally compact abelian group) which is self-dual with respect to the canonical additive
character ψF of F . Tate in his article [32] denotes this Langlands convention of local constants
[32], p. 17), the Langlands factor L(ρ, ψ) is L(ρ, ψ) =
as L(ρ, ψ). According to Tate (cf.
D(ρω 1
F =

− 1
2 νF (x)
(in Section 2.3 we discuss them in more details) which we may consider as a character
q
F
of F ×, and where dxψ is the self-dual Haar measure corresponding to the additive character
ψ and qF is the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of F . According to Tate (cf. [31], p. 105) the
relation among three conventions of the local constants is:

, ψ, dxψ), where ω denotes the normalized absolute value of F , i.e., ω 1

, ψF , dxψF).

(1.0.1)

In Chapter 2 we recall almost all necessary ingredients for this thesis, and they will be used
in our next chapters. First we mention the basic properties of local ﬁelds and their extensions.
We study the Lemma 2.1.2 of J-P. Serre and it will be used in Chapter 3. This result has a
great role for the computation of λ-functions. The central keywords of this thesis are the local
constants and Heisenberg representations. Therefore in Chapter 2 we spend little more time

1

on them. All properties of local constants are well-studied by various people: Langlands [41],
Tate [31], Deligne [37], Bushnell-Henniart [6]. We show the connection between all conventions
of local constants. We also know that there is a connection between the classical Gauss sums
and the local constants of representations of a local Galois group. When the conductor of a
multiplicative character of a local ﬁeld is one, then by proper choice of additive character we
see that the computation of local constants comes down to the computation of the classical
Gauss sums. Therefore for our lambda-functions computation we need the Theorem 2.4.1
(regarding classical Gauss sum of quadratic character). In Section 2.6 we discuss the group
theoretical structure of Heisenberg representations, and for this we follow the articles [11],
[12], [14].

In Chapter 3 we compute the lambda-functions for ﬁnite Galois extensions explicitly,
except wildly ramiﬁed quadratic extensions. Let K/F be a ﬁnite Galois extension of a non-
archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp and G = Gal(K/F). The lambda function for the extension K/F
is λK/F (ψF ) := W (IndK/F 1, ψF ), where W denotes the local constant and ψF is the canonical
additive character of F . We also can deﬁne λ-function via Deligne’s constant c(ρ) := W (ρ)
W (det(ρ)),
where ρ is a representation of G and

where ρ = IndG

1 (1) and ∆G

1 = W (ρ) = c(ρ) · W (det(ρ)) = c(ρ) · W (∆G
λG
1 ),
1 := det(IndG

1 (1)).

Firstly, in Section 3.2 we compute the λ-function for odd degree Galois extension by using
some functoriality properties of λ-functions and the following lemmas (cf. Lemma 3.2.1,
Lemma 3.2.2);
Lemma 1.0.1. Let L/F be a ﬁnite Galois extension and F ⊂ K ⊂ L with H = Gal(L/K)
and G = Gal(L/F). If H (cid:54) G is a normal subgroup and if [G : H] is odd, then ∆K/F ≡ 1
and λ2

K/F = 1.

Lemma 1.0.2. The G and H are as in the previous lemma.

1. If H (cid:54) G is a normal subgroup of odd index [G : H], then λG
2. If there exists a normal subgroup N of G such that N (cid:54) H (cid:54) G and [G : N ] odd, then

H = 1.

λG
H = 1.

we obtain the following result (cf. Theorem 3.2.3)

Theorem 1.0.3. Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld and E/F be an odd degree Galois
extension. If L ⊃ K ⊃ F be any ﬁnite extension inside E, then λL/K = 1.

And in Section 3.3 we compute λG

1 , where G is a local Galois group for a ﬁnite Galois
[4], Theorem 1) and Theorem 3.1.2 (due to

extension. By using Bruno Kahn’s results (cf.
Deligne) we obtain the following result (cf. Theorem 3.3.10).

Theorem 1.0.4. Let G be a ﬁnite local Galois group of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . Let
S be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Denote cG

1 = c(IndG

1 (1)).

2

1. If S = {1}, then we have λG
2. If the Sylow 2-subgroup S ⊂ G is nontrivial cyclic (exceptional case), then

1 = 1.

if G does not contain Klein’s 4 group V .

4. If S is nontrivial and not metacyclic, then λG

1 = 1.

From the above theorem we observe that λG

1 = 1, except the exceptional case and
the invariant case when G contains Klein’s 4-group. Moreover, here α is the uniquely
determined quadratic character of G, then W (α) = λF2/F , where F2/F is the quadratic
extension corresponding to α of G = Gal(K/F). In fact, in the invariant case we need to
1 , where V is Klein’s 4-group. If p (cid:54)= 2 then V corresponds to a tame extension
compute λV
and there we have the explicit computation of λV
Lemma 1.0.5. Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld with p (cid:54)= 2. Let K/F be the uniquely determined
extension with V = Gal(K/F), Klein’s 4-group. Then
1 = λK/F = −1 if −1 ∈ F × is a square, i.e., qF ≡ 1 (mod 4), and
λV
1 = λK/F = 1 if −1 ∈ F × is not a square, i.e., if qF ≡ 3 (mod 4),
λV
where qF is the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of F .

1 in Lemma 3.3.9.

In [38] Deligne computes the Deligne’s constant c(ρ), where ρ is a ﬁnite dimensional
orthogonal representation of the absolute Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld
F via second Stiefel-Whitney class of ρ. The computations of these Deligne’s constants are
important to give explicit formulas of lambda functions. But the second Stiefel-Whitney
classes s2(ρ) are not the same as Deligne’s constants, therefore full information of s2(ρ) will
not give complete information about Deligne’s constants. Therefore to complete the explicit
computations of λG

1 we need to use the deﬁnition

λG
1 = λK/F (ψ) = W (IndK/F1, ψ),

where ψ is a nontrivial additive character of F . When we take the canonical additive character
ψF , we simply write λK/F = W (IndK/F1, ψF), instead of λK/F (ψF ).

When p (cid:54)= 2, in Theorem 3.3.10, we notice that to complete the whole computation we
need to compute λK/F , where K/F is a quadratic tame extension. In general, in Section 3.4
we study the explicit computation for even degree local Galois extension.

Moreover, by using the properties of λ-function and Lemma 3.4.3 we give general formula
of λK/F , where K/F is an even degree unramiﬁed extension and the result is (cf. Theorem
3.4.5):

3

λK/F (ψF ) = (−1)n(ψF ).

When K/F is an even degree Galois extension with odd ramiﬁcation index we have the
following result (cf. Theorem 3.4.7).

Theorem 1.0.6. Let K be an even degree Galois extension of F with odd ramiﬁcation index.
Let ψ be a nontrivial additive character of F . Then

λK/F (ψ) = (−1)n(ψ).

When K/F is a tamely ramiﬁed quadratic extension, by using classical Gauss sum we

have an explicit formula (cf. Theorem 3.4.10) for λK/F .
Theorem 1.0.7. Let K be a tamely ramiﬁed quadratic extension of F/Qp with qF = ps.
Let ψF be the canonical additive character of F . Let c ∈ F × with −1 = νF (c) + dF/Qp, and
c(cid:48) =
(pc), where F0/Qp is the maximal unramiﬁed extension in F/Qp. Let ψ−1 be an
additive character with conductor −1, of the form ψ−1 = c(cid:48) · ψF . Then

(1.0.2)

Here ”overline” stands for modulo PF0.

By the properties of λ-function and the above theorem, we can give complete computation
of λK/F , where K/F is a tamely ramiﬁed even degree Galois extension. But the computation
of λK/F , where K/F is a wildly ramiﬁed quadratic extension, seems subtle. In Subsection
3.4.2 we give few computation in the wild case, and they are:
Lemma 1.0.8. Let K be the ﬁnite abelian extension of Q2 for which NK/Q2(K×) = Q×
Then λK/Q2 = 1.

2.

2

More generally, we show (cf. Theorem 3.4.13) that when F/Q2, and K is the abelian
extension of F for which NK/F (K×) = F ×2, then λK/F = 1. In Example 3.4.14 we compute
λF/Q2, where F is a quadratic extension of Q2.

In Chapter 4 we give an invariant formula (group theoretical) of the determinant of a
Heisenberg representation. From Gallagher’s theorem 2.8.2 we know that to compute the
determinant of an induced representation we need to compute the transfer map. Since our
Heisenberg representations of degree (cid:62) 2 are induced representation, we ﬁrst need to give

4

formula for transfer maps which we give in Lemmas 4.1.1 and 4.1.3. By using them in
Proposition 4.2.2 we give an invariant formula of the determinant of Heisenberg representation.
Let G be a ﬁnite group and ρ be a Heisenberg representation of G. Let Z be the scalar
group for ρ and H be a maximal isotropic subgroup of G for ρ. Let χH be a linear character
of H which is an extension of the central character χZ of ρ. Then we know that ρ = IndG
HχH.
The main aim of Chapter 4 is to give an invariant formula for:

det(ρ) = det(IndG

HχH).

In other words, we will show that this formula is independent of the choice of the maxi-
mal isotropic subgroup H because the maximal isotropic subgroups are not unique. From
Gallagher’s result (cf. Theorem 2.8.2) we know that

det(IndG

HχH)(g) = ∆G

H(g) · χH(TG/H(g)) for all g ∈ G.

Therefore for explicit computation of determinant of Heisenberg representation ρ, we ﬁrst
need to compute the transfer map TG/H. In Lemma 4.1.1 we compute TG/H, when H is an
abelian normal subgroup of a ﬁnite group G (of odd index in G) with [G, [G, G]] = {1}, and
G/H is an abelian quotient group.

Lemma 1.0.9. Assume that G is a ﬁnite group and H a normal subgroup of G such that

1. H is abelian,

2. G/H is abelian of odd order d,
3. [G, [G, G]] = {1}.

Then we have TG/H(g) = gd for all g ∈ G.
As a consequence one has [G, G]d = {1}, in other words, Gd is contained in the center of G.

More generally, combining this above Lemma and the elementary divisor theorem, we

obtain the following result (cf. Lemma 4.1.3).

Lemma 1.0.10. Assume that G is a ﬁnite group and H a normal subgroup of G such that

1. H is abelian

2. G/H is abelian of order d, such that (according to the elementary divisor theorem):

G/H ∼= Z/m1 × ··· × Z/ms

where m1|···|ms and(cid:81)
tiH ∈ G/H generates the cyclic factor ∼= Z/mi, hence tmi

i ∈ H.

i mi = d. Moreover, we ﬁx elements t1, t2,··· , ts ∈ G such that

3. [G, [G, G]] = {1}. In particular, [G, G] is in the center Z(G) of G.

Then each g ∈ G has a unique decomposition

TG/H(g) = gd · ϕG/H(g),

As a consequence of the second equality in (ii) combined with [G, G] ⊆ H ∩ Ker(TG/H), one
has [G, G]d = {1}, in other words, Gd is contained in the center Z(G) of G.

Now let ρ = (Z, χρ) be a Heisenberg representation of G. Then from the deﬁnition of

Heisenberg representation we have

[[G, G], G] ⊆ Ker(ρ).

Now let G := G/Ker(ρ). Then we obtain

[G, G] = [G/Ker(ρ), G/Ker(ρ)] = [G, G] · Ker(ρ)/Ker(ρ) = [G, G]/[G, G] ∩ Ker(ρ).

Since [[G, G], G] ⊆ Ker(ρ), then [x, g] ∈ Ker(ρ) for all x ∈ [G, G] and g ∈ G. Hence we obtain

[[G, G], G] = [[G, G]/[G, G] ∩ Ker(ρ), G/Ker(ρ)] ⊆ Ker(ρ),

This shows that G is a two-step nilpotent group. Hence for computing determinant of a
Heisenberg representation of a ﬁnite group modulo Ker(ρ) we can use the Lemmas 4.1.1 and
4.1.3 and we obtain the following result (cf. Proposition 4.2.2).

Proposition 1.0.11. Let ρ = (Z, χρ) be a Heisenberg representation of G, of dimension d,
and put Xρ(g1, g2) := χρ ◦ [g1, g2]. Then we obtain

(det(ρ))(g) = ε(g) · χρ(gd),

(1.0.3)

where ε is a function on G with the following properties:

6

1. ε has values in {±1}.
2. ε(gx) = ε(g) for all x ∈ G2 · Z, hence ε is a function on the factor group G/G2 · Z, and

in particular, ε ≡ 1 if [G : Z] = d2 is odd.

3. If d is even, then the function ε need not be a homomorphism but:

ε(g1)ε(g2)
ε(g1g2) = Xρ(g1, g2)

d(d−1)

2 = Xρ(g1, g2) d

Furthermore,

(b) When rk2(G/Z) = 2: ε is not a homomorphism and ε is a function on G/G2Z

such that

(det ρ)(g) = ε(g) · χρ(gd) =

χρ(gd)

−χρ(gd)

for g ∈ G2Z
for g /∈ G2Z.

In Chapter 5, our main aim is to compute local constants for Heisenberg representations
of a local Galois group. We know that Heisenberg representations are monomial (that is,
induced from linear character of a ﬁnite-index subgroup), and local constants are weakly
extendible functions. Therefore to compute local constants for Heisenberg representations we
need to compute lambda-functions. In Chapter 3 we compute lambda-functions explicitly for
ﬁnite Galois extensions (except wildly ramiﬁed quadratic extension), and in Chapter 5 we use
them.

In Section 5.1, we study the arithmetic descriptions of Heisenberg representations. We

deﬁne U-isotropic Heisenberg representations and prove the following lemma (cf. 5.1.9).

Lemma 1.0.12. Fix a uniformizer πF and write U := UF . Then we obtain an isomorphism

(cid:98)U ∼=

(cid:92)F F ×/U ∧ U ,

η (cid:55)→ Xη,

ηX ← X

between characters of U and U -isotropic alternating characters as follows:

F ε2) := η(ε1)b · η(ε2)−a,
where a, b ∈ Z, ε, ε1, ε2 ∈ U , and η : U → C×. Then

F ε1, πb

Xη(πa

ηX(ε) := X(ε, πF ),

(1.0.4)

Rad(Xη) =< π#η

F > ×Ker(η) =< (πFε)#η > ×Ker(η),

does not depend on the choice of πF , where #η is the order of the character η, hence

F ×/Rad(Xη) ∼=< πF > / < π#η

F > ×U/Ker(η) ∼= Z#η × Z#η.

Therefore all Heisenberg representations of type ρ = ρ(Xη, χ) have dimension dim(ρ) = #η.

7

From the above lemma we can construct all Heisenberg representations of dimensions
prime to p (cf. Corollary 5.1.13). And we also have the following explicit lemma (cf. Lemma
5.1.16).

Lemma 1.0.13 (Explicit Lemma). Let ρ = ρ(Xη, χK) be a U-isotropic Heisenberg repre-
sentation of the absolute Galois group GF of a local ﬁeld F/Qp. Let K = Kη and let E/F be
the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in K/F . Then:

1. The norm map induces an isomorphism:

NK/E : K×

F /IF K× ∼→ IF E×/IFNK/E.

2. Let cK/F : F ×/Rad(Xη)∧F×/Rad(Xη) ∼= K×

F /IFK× be the isomorphism which is induced
by the commutator in the relative Weil-group WK/F . Then for units ε ∈ UF we explicitly
have:

cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) = N−1

K/E(N−1

E/F (ε)1−ϕE/F ),

where ϕE/F is the Frobenius automorphism for E/F and where N−1 means to take a
preimage of the norm map.

3. The restriction χK|K×

F

is characterized by:
χK ◦ cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) = Xη(ε, πF ) = η(ε),
for all ε ∈ UF , where cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) is explicitly given via (2).

After these, in Subsection 5.1.2, we study the Artin conductors, Swan conductors of Heisen-
berg representations, and these results are important for giving explicit invariant formulas of
local constants for Heisenberg representations of dimensions prime to p.

In the following theorem (cf. Theorem 5.2.4) we give an invariant formula of W (ρ) for the

Heisenberg representation ρ.

Theorem 1.0.14. Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois
group GF of a local ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension d. Let ψF be the canonical additive character of
F and ψK := ψF ◦ TrK/F. Denote µp∞ as the group of roots of unity of p-power order and µn
as the group of n-th roots of unity, where n > 1 is an integer.

1. When the dimension d is odd, we have

W (ρ) ≡ W (χρ)(cid:48) mod µd,

where W (χρ)(cid:48) is any d-th root of W (χK, ψK).

2. When the dimension d is even, we have

W (ρ) ≡ W (χρ)(cid:48) mod µd(cid:48),

8

where d(cid:48) = lcm(4, d).

For giving more explicit invariant formula of local constants for the Heisenberg represen-

tations, we need the following result (cf. Proposition 5.1.7).

Proposition 1.0.15. Let ρ = ρ(Z, χρ) = ρ(GK, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the
absolute Galois group GF . Let E be a base ﬁeld of a maximal isotropic for ρ. Then F × ⊆
NK/E, and

det(ρ)(x) = ∆E/F (x) · χK ◦ N−1

K/E(x)

for all x ∈ F ×,

where, for all x ∈ F ×,

∆E/F (x) =

1

when rk2(Gal(E/F)) (cid:54)= 1
ωE(cid:48)/F (x) when rk2(Gal(E/F)) = 1,

(1.0.5)

(1.0.6)

where E(cid:48)/F is a uniquely determined quadratic subextension in E/F , and ωE(cid:48)/F is the char-
acter of F × which corresponds to E(cid:48)/F by class ﬁeld theory.

By using the above proposition we have the following invariant formula (cf. Theorem 5.2.5)
of local constant for a minimal conductor U-isotopic Heisenberg representation of dimension
prime to p.

Theorem 1.0.16. Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a minimal conductor Heisenberg representation of
the absolute Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension m with
gcd(m, p) = 1. Let ψ be a nontrivial additive character of F . Then

W (ρ, ψ) = R(ψ, c) · L(ψ, c),

(1.0.7)

where

R(ψ, c) := λE/F (ψ)∆E/F (c),

is a fourth root of unity that depends on c ∈ F × with νF (c) = 1 + n(ψ) but not on the totally
ramiﬁed cyclic subextension E/F in K/F , and

where E1/F is the unramiﬁed extension of F of degree m.

And when ρ = ρ(X, χK) is not minimal conductor, we have the following theorem (cf.

Theorem 5.2.8).

Theorem 1.0.17. Let ρ = ρ(Xη, χK) = ρ0⊗(cid:102)χF be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute
where ρ0 = ρ0(Xη, χ0) is a minimal conductor Heisenberg representation of GF and (cid:102)χF :

Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension m with gcd(m, p) = 1,

WF → C× corresponds to χF : F × → C× by class ﬁeld theory. If a(χF ) (cid:62) 2, then we have

W (ρ, ψ) = W (ρ0 ⊗(cid:102)χF , ψ) = W (χF , ψ)m · det(ρ0)(c),

(1.0.8)

where ψ is a nontrivial additive character of F , and c := c(χF , ψ) ∈ F ×, satisﬁes

.

In Section 5.3 we use the Tate’s root-of-unity criterion (cf. [31], p. 112, Corollary 4) in
our local constant computation. Let ρ be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois
group GF . In the following proposition (cf. Proposition 5.3.2) we show that if W (ρ) is not a
root of unity, then dim(ρ)|(qF − 1).
Proposition 1.0.18. Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld and let qF = ps be the order of its ﬁnite residue
ﬁeld. If ρ = (Zρ, χρ) = ρ(Xρ, χK) is a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois group
GF such that W (ρ) is not a root of unity, then dim(ρ)|(qF − 1).

Chapter 2

Preliminaries

In this chapter, we will recall some background of local constants, classical Gauss sums,
Heisenberg representations that will be relevant to the next chapters. We also state some
known facts which we will use in our next chapters. In this chapter for local constants we
follow [41], [31], [32] and for extendible functions [18]. For classical Gauss sums and Heisenberg
representations we refer [40], [3] and [11], [12] respectively.

2.1 Local Fields and their ﬁnite extensions

Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld, i.e., a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld Qp (ﬁeld of p-adic
numbers), where p is a prime. Let K/F be a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld F . Let eK/F be the
ramiﬁcation index for the extension K/F and fK/F be the residue degree of the extension
K/F . The extension K/F is called unramiﬁed if eK/F = 1; equivalently fK/F = [K : F ].
The extension K/F is totally ramiﬁed if eK/F = [K : F ]; equivalently fK/F = 1. Let qF
be the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld kF of F . If gcd(p, [K : F ]) = 1, then the extension
K/F is called tamely ramiﬁed, otherwise wildly ramiﬁed. The extension K/F is totally
tamely ramiﬁed if it is both totally ramiﬁed and tamely ramiﬁed.

For a tower of local ﬁelds K/L/F , we have (cf. [20], p. 39, Lemma 2.1)

eK/F (νK) = eK/L(νK) · eL/F (νL),

(2.1.1)
where νK is a valuation on K and νL is the induced valuation on L, i.e., νL = νK|L. For the
tower of ﬁelds K/L/F we simply write eK/F = eK/L · eL/F . Let OF be the ring of integers in
the local ﬁeld F and PF = πF OF is the unique prime ideal in OF and πF is a uniformizer,
i.e., an element in PF whose valuation is one, i.e., νF (πF ) = 1. Let UF = OF − PF be the
group of units in OF . Let P i
F (with
proviso U 0
F ). We also consider that a(χ) is the conductor of nontrivial character
χ : F × → C×, i.e., a(χ) is the smallest integer m (cid:62) 0 such that χ is trivial on U m
F . We say
χ is unramiﬁed if the conductor of χ is zero and otherwise ramiﬁed. Throughout the thesis
when K/F is unramiﬁed we choose uniformizers πK = πF . And when K/F is totally ramiﬁed

F = {x ∈ F : νF (x) (cid:62) i} and for i (cid:62) 0 deﬁne U i

F = UF = O×

F = 1 + P i

11

(both tame and wild) we choose uniformizers πF = NK/F (πK), where NK/F is the norm map
from K× to F ×.

Deﬁnition 2.1.1 (Diﬀerent and Discriminant). Let K/F be a ﬁnite separable extension
of non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . We deﬁne the inverse diﬀerent (or codiﬀerent) D−1
K/F
−dK/F
of K over F to be π
OK, where dK/F is the largest integer (this is the exponent of the
K
diﬀerent DK/F ) such that

TrK/F (π

−dK/F
K

OK) ⊆ OF ,

where TrK/F is the trace map from K to F . Then the diﬀerent is deﬁned by:

and the discriminant DK/F is

DK/F = π

dK/F
K OK

DK/F = NK/F (π

dK/F
K )OF .

Thus it is easy to see that DK/F is an ideal of OF .

We know that if K/F is unramiﬁed, then DK/F is a unit in OF .

If K/F is tamely

ramiﬁed, then

νK(DK/F ) = dK/F = eK/F − 1.

(2.1.2)

(see [26], Chapter III, for details about diﬀerent and discriminant of the extension K/F .)

We need to mention a very important result of J-P. Serre for our purposes.

Lemma 2.1.2 ([26], p. 50, Proposition 7). Let K/F be a ﬁnite separable extension of the
ﬁeld F . Let IF (resp. IK) be a fractional ideal of F (resp. K) relative to OF (resp. OK).
Then the following two properties are equivalent:

1. TrK/F (IK) ⊂ IF .
2. IK ⊂ IF .D−1

K/F .

Deﬁnition 2.1.3 (Canonical additive character). We deﬁne the non trivial additive
character of F , ψF : F → C× as the composition of the following four maps:

TrF/Qp−−−−→ Qp

α−→ Qp/Zp

β−→ Q/Z γ−→ C×,

F

where

1. TrF/Qp is the trace from F to Qp,

2. α is the canonical surjection map,
3. β is the canonical injection which maps Qp/Zp onto the p-component of the divisible

group Q/Z and

4. γ is the exponential map x (cid:55)→ e2πix, where i =

12

√−1.

For every x ∈ Qp, there is a rational r, uniquely determined modulo 1, such that x − r ∈ Zp.
Then ψQp(x) = ψQp(r) = e2πir. The nontrivial additive character ψF = ψQp ◦ TrF/Qp of F is
called the canonical additive character (cf. [31], p. 92).

The conductor of any nontrivial additive character ψ of the ﬁeld F is an integer n(ψ) if
. So, from Lemma 2.1.2 we can show (cf.

, but nontrivial on P

−n(ψ)−1
F

−n(ψ)
ψ is trivial on P
F
Lemma 3.4.3) that

n(ψF ) = n(ψQp ◦ TrF/Qp) = νF(DF/Qp),

because dQp/Qp = 0, and hence n(ψQp) = 0.

2.2 Extendible functions

Let G be any ﬁnite group. We denote R(G) the set of all pairs (H, ρ), where H is a subgroup
of G and ρ is a virtual representation of H . The group G acts on R(G) by means of

(H, ρ)g = (H g, ρg), g ∈ G,

ρg(x) = ρ(gxg−1), x ∈ H g := g−1Hg

Furthermore we denote by (cid:98)H the set of all one dimensional representations of H and by R1(G)
the subset of R(G) of pairs (H, χ) with χ ∈ (cid:98)H. Here character χ of H we mean always a

linear character, i.e., χ : H → C×.

Now deﬁne a function F : R1(G) → A, where A is a multiplicative abelian group with

and

F(H, 1H) = 1

F(H g, χg) = F(H, χ)

(2.2.1)

(2.2.2)

for all (H, χ), where 1H denotes the trivial representation of H.
Here a function F on R1(G) means a function which satisﬁes the equation (2.2.1) and (2.2.2).
A function F is said to be extendible if F can be extended to an A-valued function on

R(G) satisfying:

(2.2.3)
for all (H, ρi) ∈ R(G), i = 1, 2, and if (H, ρ) ∈ R(G) with dim ρ = 0, and ∆ is a subgroup of
G containing H, then

F(H, ρ1 + ρ2) = F(H, ρ1)F(H, ρ2)

where Ind∆
Hρ is the virtual representation of ∆ induced from ρ. In general, let ρ be a repre-
sentation of H with dim ρ (cid:54)= 0. We can deﬁne a zero dimensional representation of H by ρ
and which is: ρ0 := ρ − dim ρ · 1H. So dim ρ0 is zero, then now we use the equation (2.2.4)
for ρ0 and we have,

F(∆, Ind∆

Hρ) = F(H, ρ),

F(∆, Ind∆

Hρ0) = F(H, ρ0).

13

(2.2.4)

(2.2.5)

Now replace ρ0 by ρ − dimρ · 1H in the above equation (2.2.5) and we have

F(∆, Ind∆

H(ρ − dimρ · 1H)) = F(H, ρ − dimρ · 1H)

=⇒ F(∆, Ind∆
F(∆, Ind∆

Therefore,

.

But by the deﬁnition of F, we have F(H, 1H) = 1, so we can write

H(F) = F(∆, Ind∆
λ∆

H1H).

(2.2.8)
H(F) is called Langlands λ-function (or simply λ-function) which is independent
This λ∆
of ρ. A extendible function F is called strongly extendible if it satisﬁes equation (2.2.3)
and fulﬁlls equation (2.2.4) for all (H, ρ) ∈ R(G), and if the equation (2.2.4) is fulﬁlled only
when dim ρ = 0, then F is called weakly extendible function. The extendible functions are
unique, if they exist (cf. [31], p. 103).

Example 2.2.1. Langlands proves the local constants are weakly extendible functions (cf.
[31], p. 105, Theorem 1). The Artin root numbers (also known as global constants) are
strongly extendible functions (for more examples and details about extendible function, see
[31] and [18]).

The next lemma is due to Langlands [41]. This is very important for this thesis. Group
theoretically it is not hard to see its proof. But its number theoretical proof is very very
diﬃcult and long which can be found in [41].
Lemma 2.2.2. Let H be a subgroup of a group G and F an extendible function on R1(G).
Then we have the following properties of λ-factor.

1. If g ∈ G, then λG
2. If H(cid:48) is a subgroup of H then λG

g−1Hg(F) = λG

H(F), where H ⊆ G.

2.3 Local Constants
Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld and χ be a character of F ×. The L(χ)-functions are
deﬁned as follows:

(1 − χ(πF ))−1

1

L(χ) =

if χ is unramiﬁed,

if χ is ramiﬁed.

We denote by dx a Haar measure on F , by d×x a Haar measure on F × and the relation

between these two Haar measure is:

d×x = dx|x|,

for arbitrary Haar measure dx on F . For given additive character ψ of F and Haar measure
dx on F , we have a Fourier transform as:

ˆf (y) =

f (x)ψ(xy)dx.

(2.3.1)
where f ∈ L1(F +) (that is, |f| is integrable) and the Haar measure is normalized such that
ˆˆf (y) = f (−y), i.e., dx is self-dual with respect to ψ. By Tate (cf.
[32], p. 13), for any
character χ of F ×, there exists a number W (χ, ψ, dx) ∈ C× such that it satisﬁes the following
local functional equation:

(cid:82) ˆf (x)w1χ−1(x)d×x

L(w1χ−1)

(cid:82) f (x)χ(x)d×x

L(χ)

= W (χ, ψ, dx)

.

(2.3.2)

for any such function f for which the both sides make sense. This number W (χ, ψ, dx) is
called the local epsilon factor or local constant of χ.

For a nontrivial multiplicative character χ of F × and nontrivial additive character ψ of

(cid:90)

F , we have (cf. [41], p. 4)

W (χ, ψ, c) = χ(c)

(cid:82)
|(cid:82)

χ−1(x)ψ(x/c)dx
χ−1(x)ψ(x/c)dx|

(2.3.3)

where the Haar measure dx is normalized such that the measure of OF is 1 and where c ∈ F ×
with valuation n(ψ) + a(χ). The modiﬁed formula of epsilon factor (cf. [31], p. 94, for proof
see [46]) is:

W (χ, ψ, c) = χ(c)q−a(χ)/2 (cid:88)

χ−1(x)ψ(x/c).

where c = πa(χ)+n(ψ)

F

. Now if u ∈ UF is unit and replace c = cu, then we have
χ−1(x/u)ψ(x/cu) = W (χ, ψ, c).

W (χ, ψ, cu) = χ(c)q− a(χ)

(cid:88)

Therefore W (χ, ψ, c) depends only on the exponent νF (c) = a(χ) + n(ψ). Therefore we can
simply write W (χ, ψ, c) = W (χ, ψ), because c is determined by νF (c) = a(χ) + n(ψ) up to

15

a unit u which has no inﬂuence on W (χ, ψ, c). If χ is unramiﬁed, i.e., a(χ) = 0, therefore
νF (c) = n(ψ). Then from the formula of W (χ, ψ, c), we can write

W (χ, ψ, c) = χ(c),

(2.3.6)

and therefore W (1, ψ, c) = 1 if χ = 1 is the trivial character.

2.3.1 Some properties of W (χ, ψ)

1. Let b ∈ F × be the uniquely determined element such that ψ(cid:48) = bψ. Then

W (χ, ψ(cid:48), c(cid:48)) = χ(b) · W (χ, ψ, c).

(2.3.7)

Proof. Here ψ(cid:48)(x) = (bψ)(x) := ψ(bx) for all x ∈ F .
It is an additive character of
F . The existence and uniqueness of b is clear. From the deﬁnition of conductor of an
additive character we have

n(ψ(cid:48)) = n(bψ) = n(ψ) + νF (b).

Here c(cid:48) ∈ F × is of valuation

νF (c(cid:48)) = a(χ) + n(ψ(cid:48)) = a(χ) + νF (b) + n(ψ) = νF (b) + νF (c) = νF (bc).

Therefore c(cid:48) = bcu where u ∈ UF is some unit. Now

W (χ, ψ(cid:48), c(cid:48)) = W (χ, bψ, bcu)

2. Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld inside Qp. Let χ and ψ be a character of F × and F + re-
spectively, and c ∈ F × with valuation νF (c) = a(χ) + n(ψ). If σ ∈ Gal(Qp/Qp) is an
automorphism, then:

WF (χ, ψ, c) = Wσ−1(F )(χσ, ψσ, σ−1(c)),
where χσ(y) := χ(σ(y)), ψσ(y) := ψ(σ(y)), for all y ∈ σ−1(F ).

Proof. Let L := σ−1(F ). Since σ is an automorphism of Qp, then we have OF /PF
OL/PL, hence qF = qL. We also can see that a(χσ) = a(χ) and n(ψσ) = n(ψ). Then
from the formula of local constant we have

= WF (χ, ψ, c).

Here we put y = σ−1(x) and use (σ−1(c))−1ψσ = (c−1ψ)σ.

Remark 2.3.1. We can simply write as before WF (χ, ψ) = Wσ−1(F )(χσ, ψσ). Tate in his
paper [31] on local constants deﬁnes the local root number as:

WF (χ) := WF (χ, ψF ) = WF (χ, ψF , d),

where ψF is the canonical character of F × and d ∈ F × with νF (d) = a(χ) + n(ψF ).
Therefore after ﬁxing canonical additive character ψ = ψF , we can rewrite

WF (χ) = χ(d(ψF )), if χ is unramiﬁed,

WF (χ) = Wσ−1(F )(χσ).

The last equality follows because the canonical character ψσ−1(F ) is related to the canon-
ical character ψF as: ψσ−1(F ) = ψσ
F .

So we see that

(F, χ) → WF (χ) ∈ C×

is a function with the properties (2.2.1), (2.2.2) of extendible functions.

3. If χ ∈ (cid:99)F × and ψ ∈ (cid:98)F , then

W (χ, ψ) · W (χ−1, ψ) = χ(−1).

Furthermore if the character χ : F × → C× is unitary (in particular, if χ is of ﬁnite
order), then

|W (χ, ψ)|2 = 1.

17

Proof. We prove this properties by using equation (2.3.4). We know that the additive
characters are always unitary, hence

ψ(−x) = ψ(x)−1 = ψ(x).

On the other hand we write ψ(−x) = ((−1)ψ)(x), where −1 ∈ F ×. Therefore ψ =
(−1)ψ. We also have a(χ) = a(χ−1). Therefore by using equation (2.3.4) we have

(2.3.9)

The right side of equation (2.3.9) is a sign, hence we may rewrite (2.3.9) as

W (χ, ψ) · χ(−1)W (χ−1, ψ) = 1.

But we also know from our earlier property that

χ(−1)W (χ−1, ψ) = W (χ−1, (−1)ψ) = W (χ−1, ψ).

So the identity (2.3.9) rewrites as

W (χ, ψ) · W (χ−1, ψ) = 1.

Now we assume that χ is unitary, hence

W (χ−1, ψ) = W (χ, ψ) = W (χ, ψ)

where the last equality is obvious. Now we see that for unitary χ the identity (2.3.9)
rewrites as

|W (χ, ψ)|2 = 1.

Remark 2.3.2. From the functional equation (2.3.2), we can directly see the ﬁrst part
of the above property of local constant. Denote

(cid:90)

ζ(f, χ) =

f (x)χ(x)d×x.

Now replacing f by

ˆˆf in equation (2.3.10), and we get

(cid:90) ˆˆf (x)χ(x)d×x = χ(−1) · ζ(f, χ),

ˆˆf, χ) =

ζ(

19

(2.3.10)

(2.3.11)

because dx is self-dual with respect to ψ, hence

ˆˆf (x) = f (−x) for all x ∈ F +.

Again the functional equation (2.3.2) can be written as follows:

ζ( ˆf , w1χ−1) = W (χ, ψ, dx) · L(w1χ−1)

L(χ)

· ζ(f, χ).

Now we replace f by ˆf , and χ by w1χ−1 in equation (2.3.12), and we obtain

ˆˆf, χ) = W (w1χ−1, ψ, dx) ·
ζ(

L(χ)

L(w1χ−1)

· ζ( ˆf , w1χ−1).

(2.3.12)

(2.3.13)

Then by using equations (2.3.11), (2.3.12), from the above equation (2.3.13) we obtain:

W (χ, ψ, dx) · W (w1χ−1, ψ, dx) = χ(−1).

(2.3.14)

Moreover, the convention W (χ, ψ) is actually as follows (cf.
(3.6.4)):

[32], p. 17, equation

By using this relation from equation (2.3.14) we can conclude

W (χws− 1

2

, ψ) = W (χws, ψ, dx).

W (χ, ψ) · W (χ−1, ψ) = χ(−1).

4. Twisting formula of abelian local constants:

(a) If χ1 and χ2 are two unramiﬁed characters of F × and ψ is a nontrivial additive

character of F , then from equation (2.3.6) we have

W (χ1χ2, ψ) = W (χ1, ψ)W (χ2, ψ).

(2.3.15)

(b) Let χ1 be ramiﬁed and χ2 unramiﬁed then (cf. [32], (3.2.6.3))
W (χ1χ2, ψ) = χ2(πF )a(χ1)+n(ψ) · W (χ1, ψ).

(2.3.16)

Proof. By the given condition a(χ1) > a(χ2) = 0. Therefore a(χ1χ2) = a(χ1).
Then we have

W (χ1χ2, ψ) = χ1χ2(c)q

(c) We also have twisting formula of epsilon factor by Deligne (cf. [37], Lemma 4.16)
under some special condition and which is as follows (for proof, see Corollary
6.1.2(3)):
Let α and β be two multiplicative characters of a local ﬁeld F such that a(α) (cid:62)
2 · a(β). Let ψ be an additive character of F . Let yα,ψ be an element of F × such
that

for all x ∈ F with valuation νF (x) (cid:62) a(α)

α(1 + x) = ψ(yα,ψx)

W (αβ, ψ) = β−1(yα,ψ) · W (α, ψ).

2.3.2 Connection of diﬀerent conventions for local constants

Mainly there are two conventions for local constants. They are due to Langlands ([41])
and Deligne ([37]). Recently Bushnell and Henniart ([6]) also give a convention of local
constants.
In this subsection we shall show the connection among all three conventions
for local constants1 We denote BH as local constant of Bushnell-Henniart (introduced in
Bushnell-Henniart, [6], Chapter 6).

On page 142 of [6], the authors deﬁne a rational function BH(χ, ψ, s) ∈ C(q−s

Theorem 23.5 on p. 144 of [6] for ramiﬁed character χ ∈ (cid:99)F × and conductor2 n(ψ) = −1 we

Also from the Proposition 23.5 of [6] on p. 143 for unramiﬁed character χ ∈ (cid:99)F × and

F

n(ψ) = −1 we have

BH(χ, s, ψ) = q

(2.3.19)

1. Connection between BH and W (χ, ψ).

W (χ, ψ) = BH(χ, 1

2, ψ).

Proof. From [6], p. 143, Lemma 1 we see:

2, bψ) = χ(b)BH(χ, 1
1The convention W (χ, ψ) is actually due to Langlands [41], and it is:

BH(χ, 1

2, ψ)

L(χ, ψ, 1

2 ) = W (χ, ψ).

See equation (3.6.4) on p. 17 of [32] for V = χ.

2The deﬁnition of level of an additive character ψ ∈ (cid:98)F in [6] on p. 11 is the negative sign with our

conductor n(ψ), i.e., level of ψ = −n(ψ).

21

for any b ∈ F ×. But we have seen already that W (χ, bψ) = χ(b)W (χ, ψ) has the same
transformation rule. If we ﬁx one nontrivial ψ then all other nontrivial ψ(cid:48) are uniquely
given as ψ(cid:48) = bψ for some b ∈ F ×. Because of the parallel transformation rules it is now

enough to verify our assertion for a single ψ. Now we take ψ ∈ (cid:99)F + with n(ψ) = −1,

hence νF (c) = a(χ) − 1. Then we obtain

(cid:88)

W (χ, ψ) = W (χ, ψ, c) = χ(c)q

− a(χ)
F

χ−1(x)ψ(c−1x).

x∈ UF

We compare this to the equation (2.3.18). There the notation is n = a(χ) − 1 and the
assumption is n (cid:62) 0. This means we have νF (c) = n, hence we may take α = c−1 and
then comparing our formula with equation (2.3.18), we see that

W (χ, ψ) = BH(χ, 1

2, ψ)

in the case when n(ψ) = −1.
We are still left to prove our assertion if χ is unramiﬁed, i.e., a(χ) = 0. Again we can
reduce to the case where n(ψ) = −1. Then our assertion follows from equation 2.3.19.

Remark 2.3.3. From Corollary 23.4.2 of [6], on p. 142, for s ∈ C, we can write

BH(χ, s, ψ) = q

(2.3.20)
for some n(χ, ψ) ∈ Z. In fact here n(χ, ψ) = a(χ) + n(ψ). From above connection, we
just see W (χ, ψ) = BH(χ, 1

2, ψ). Thus for arbitrary s ∈ C, we obtain

· W (χ, ψ).

(2.3.21)

This equation (2.3.21) is very important for us. We shall use this to connect with
Deligne’s convention.

In [32] there is deﬁned a number D(χ, ψ, dx) depending on χ, ψ and a Haar measure
dx on F . This notion is due to Deligne [37]. We write D for Deligne’s convention in
order to distinguish it from the BH(χ, 1

2, ψ) introduced in Bushnell-Henniart [6].

In the next Lemma we give the connection between Bushnell-Henniart and Deligne
conventions for local constants.

2. The connection between D and BH:

Lemma 2.3.4. We have the relation

BH(χ, s, ψ) = D(χ · ωs, ψ, dxψ),

22

where ωs(x) = |x|s
F = q−sνF (x) is unramiﬁed character of F × corresponding to complex
number s, and where dxψ is the self-dual Haar measure corresponding to the additive
character ψ.

Proof. From equation equation (3.6.4) of [32], we know that

L(χ, s, ψ) := L(χωs− 1

2

, ψ) = D(χωs, ψ, dxψ).

(2.3.22)

We prove this connection by using the relations (2.3.21) and (2.3.22). From equation
(2.3.22) we can write our W (χ, ψ) = D(χω 1
2, we have
the relation:

, ψ, dxψ). Therefore when s = 1

BH(χ,

(2.3.24)

And when χ is ramiﬁed character, i.e., conductor a(χ) > 0, from Tate’s theorem for
unramiﬁed twist (see property 2.3.1(4b)) , we can write

W (χωs− 1

Furthermore from equation (2.3.22), we have

W (χωs− 1

(2.3.25)

Therefore ﬁnally we can write

BH(χ, s, ψ) = D(χωs, ψ, dxψ).

(2.3.26)

Corollary 2.3.5. For our W we have :

W (χ, ψ) = BH(χ, 1

2, ψ) = D(χω 1

2

, ψ, dxψ)

W (χωs− 1

2

, ψ) = BH(χ, s, ψ) = D(χωs, ψ, dxψ).

Proof. From the equations (3.6.1) and (3.6.4) of [32] for χ and above two connections
the assertions follow.

23

2.3.3 Local constants for virtual representations

1. To extend the concept of local constant, we need to go from 1-dimensional to other
virtual representations ρ of the Weil groups WF of non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . Ac-
cording to Tate [31], the root number W (χ) := W (χ, ψF ) extensions to W (ρ), where ψF
is the canonical additive character of F . More generally, W (χ, ψ) extends to W (ρ, ψ),
and if E/F is a ﬁnite separable extension then one has to take ψE = ψF ◦ TrE/F for the
extension ﬁeld E.

According to Bushnell-Henniart [6], Theorem on p. 189, the functions BH(χ, s, ψ)
extend to BH(ρ, s, ψE), where ψE = ψ◦TrE/F
3. According to Tate [32], Theorem (3.4.1)
the functions D(χ, ψ, dx) extends to D(ρ, ψ, dx). In order to get weak inductivity
we have again to use ψE = ψ ◦ TrE/F if we consider extensions. Then according to Tate
[32] (3.6.4) the Corollary 2.3.5 turns into

Corollary 2.3.6. For the virtual representations of the Weil groups we have

W (ρωE,s− 1

, ψE) = BH(ρ, s, ψE) = D(ρωE,s, ψE, dxψE ).

2

W (ρ, ψE) = BH(ρ, 1

2, ψE) = D(ρωE, 1

, ψE, dxψE ).

2

Note that on the level of ﬁeld extension E/F we have to use ωE,s which is deﬁned as

ωE,s(x) = |x|s

−sνE (x)
E

.

E = q
· νF (NE/F ) (cf. [20], p. 41, Theorem 2.5),

We also know that qE = q
therefore we can easily see that

fE/F
F

and νE = 1
fE/F

ωE,s = ωF,s ◦ NE/F .

Since the norm map NE/F : E× → F × corresponds via class ﬁeld theory to the injection
map GE (cid:44)→ GF , Tate [32] beginning from (1.4.6), simply writes ωs = ||s and consider
ωs as an unramiﬁed character of the Galois group (or of the Weil group) instead as a
character on the ﬁeld. Then Corollary 2.3.6 turns into

W (ρωs− 1

2

, ψE) = BH(ρ, s, ψE) = D(ρωs, ψE, dxψE ),

(2.3.27)

for all ﬁeld extensions, where ωs is to be considered as 1-dimensional representation of
the Weil group WE ⊂ GE if we are on the E-level. The left side equation (2.3.27) is the
-factor of Langlands (see [32], (3.6.4)).

2. The functional equation (2.3.9) extends to

W (ρ, ψ) · W (ρV , ψ) = detρ(−1),

(2.3.28)

3 Note that they ﬁx a base ﬁeld F and a nontrivial ψ = ψF (which not to be the canonical character used

in Tate [31]) but then if E/F is an extension they always use ψE = ψ ◦ TrE/F .

24

where ρ is any virtual representation of the Weil group WF , ρV is the contragredient
and ψ is any nontrivial additive character of F . This is formula (3) on p. 190 of [6] for
s = 1
2.

3. Moreover, the transformation law [32] (3.4.5) can (on the F -level) be written as:

unramiﬁed character twist

D(ρωs, ψ, dx) = D(ρ, ψ, dx) · ωF,s(cρ,ψ)

(2.3.29)

for any c = cρ,ψ such that νF (c) = a(ρ) + n(ψ)dim(ρ). It implies that also for the root
number on the F -level we have

W (ρωs, ψ) = W (ρ, ψ) · ωF,s(cρ,ψ).

(2.3.30)

2.4 Classical Gauss sums

Let kq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld. Let p be the characteristic of kq; then the prime ﬁeld contained in kq
is kp. The structure of the canonical additive character ψq of kq is the same as the structure
of the canonical character ψF , namely it comes by trace from the canonical character of
the base ﬁeld, i.e.,

where

ψq = ψp ◦ Trkq/kp,

ψp(x) := e

2πix

p

for all x ∈ kp.

Gauss sums: Let χ be a multiplicative and ψ an additive character of kq. Then the

Gauss sum G(χ, ψ) is deﬁne by

G(χ, ψ) =

(cid:88)

χ(x)ψ(x).

(2.4.1)

x∈k×

q

In general, computation of this Gauss is very diﬃcult, but for certain characters, the associated
Gauss sums can be evaluated explicitly. In the following theorem for quadratic characters of
kq we can give explicit formula of Gauss sums.

Theorem 2.4.1 ([40], p. 199, Theorem 5.15). Let kq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q = ps, where p is
an odd prime and s ∈ N. Let χ be the quadratic character of kq and let ψ be the canonical
additive character of kq. Then

(−1)s−1q 1

(−1)s−1isq 1

2

2

G(χ, ψ) =

if p ≡ 3

(mod 4),

(mod 4).

(2.4.2)

Let ψ be an additive and χ a multiplicative character of kq. Let E be a ﬁnite extension

ﬁeld of kq. Then ψ and χ can be lifted to E by the setting

25

ψ(cid:48)(x) = ψ(TrE/kq (x)) for all x ∈ E and χ(cid:48)(x) = χ(NE/kq (x)) for all x ∈ E×.

From the additivity of the trace and multiplicativity of the norm it follows that χ(cid:48) is an
additive character and χ(cid:48) is a multiplicative character of E. The following theorem gives the
relation between the Gauss sum G(χ, ψ) in kq and the Gauss sum G(χ(cid:48), ψ(cid:48)) in E.

Theorem 2.4.2 (Davenport-Hasse, [40], p. 197, Theorem 5.14). Let χ be a multiplicative
and ψ an additive character of kq, not both of them trivial. Suppose χ and ψ are lifted to
character χ(cid:48) and ψ(cid:48), respectively, of the ﬁnite extension ﬁeld E of kq with [E : kq] = s. Then

G(χ(cid:48), ψ(cid:48)) = (−1)s−1 · G(χ, ψ)s.

(2.4.3)

2.5 Witt ring and square class group of a local ﬁeld

Let F be a ﬁeld. Let M be any commutative cancellation monoid under addition. We deﬁne
a relation ∼ on M × M by

(x, y) ∼ (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) ⇐⇒ x + y(cid:48) = x(cid:48) + y ∈ M .

The cancellation law in M implies that ∼ is an equivalence relation on M × M . We deﬁne the
Grothendieck group of M to be Groth(M) = (M × M)/ ∼ (the set of equivalence classes)
with addition induced by

(x, y) + (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) = (x + x(cid:48), y + y(cid:48)).

We can prove that Groth(M) is the additive group generated by M .

Now let M (F ) be the set of all isometry classes of (nonsingular) quadratic forms of F ,

and replace M by M (F ) in the deﬁnition of Grothendieck group. Then we denote (cid:99)W (F ) =
F . Every element of (cid:99)W (F ) has the formal expression q1 − q2, where q1, q2 are nonsingular

Groth(M(F)) which is called the Witt-Grothendieck ring of quadratic forms over the ﬁeld

quadratic forms, or rather, isometry classes of such forms.

Now, consider the dimension map dim : M(F) → Z, which is a semiring homomorphism
on M (F ). This extends uniquely (via the universal property) to a ring homomorphism dim :

(cid:99)W(F) → Z, by
The kernel of this ring homomorphism, denoted by(cid:98)IF , is called the the fundamental ideal
of (cid:99)W (F ). We have(cid:99)W (F )/(cid:98)IF = Z.
and they form an ideal of(cid:99)W (F ). The vector ring

Let Z · H be the set which consists of all hyperabolic spaces and their additive inverses,

dim(q1 − q2) = dim(q1) − dim(q2).

W (F ) =(cid:99)W (F )/Z · H

is called the Witt ring of F . The image of the ideal (cid:98)IF under the natural projection
(cid:99)W (F ) → W (F ) is denoted by IF ; this is called the fundamental ideal of W (F ). It can be
shown that W (F )/IF ∼= Z/2Z (cf. [47], p. 30, Corollary 1.6).
The group F ×/F ×2 is called the square class group of F , and Q(F ) = Z2 × F ×/F ×2 is
called the extended square class group of F . We also have W (F )/I 2F ∼= Q(F ) (cf. [47], p.
31, Proposition 2.1), where I 2F denotes the square of IF . By Pﬁster’s result (cf. [47], p.
32, Corollary 2.3), we have the square class group F ×/F ×2 ∼= IF/I 2F .
Now we come to our local ﬁeld case. Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld. When F/Qp is a local ﬁeld
with p (cid:54)= 2, from Theorem 2.2(1) of [47] we have F ×/F ×2 ∼= V , where V is Klein’s 4-group.

More generally, we need the following results for computing λ-function in the wild case.
Theorem 2.5.1 ([47], p. 162, Theorem 2.22). Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld with qF as the
cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of F . Let s = νF (2). Then |F ×/F ×2| = 4 · qs
F .
In particular, if p (cid:54)= 2, i.e., s = νF (2) = 0, we have |F ×/F ×2| = 4.

When p = 2 and F/Q2 is a local ﬁeld of degree n over Q2, we have s = νF (2) = eF/Q2
= 2fF/Q2 . We also know that

because 2 is a uniformizer in Q2. We also know that qF = q

2.6 Heisenberg representations

Let ρ be an irreducible representation of a (pro-)ﬁnite group G. Then ρ is called a Heisen-
berg representation if it represents commutators by scalar matrices. Therefore higher
commutators are represented by 1. We can see that the linear characters of G are Heisenberg
representations as the degenerate special case. To classify Heisenberg representations we need
to mention two invariants of an irreducible representation ρ ∈ Irr(G):

1. Let Zρ be the scalar group of ρ, i.e., Zρ ⊆ G and ρ(z) = scalar matrix for every z ∈ Zρ.

If V /C is a representation space of ρ we get Zρ as the kernel of the composite map

ρ−→ GLC(V ) π−→ P GLC(V ) = GLC(V )/C×E,

(2.6.1)
where E is the unit matrix and denote ρ := π ◦ ρ. Therefore Zρ is a normal subgroup
of G.

G

27

2. Let χρ be the character of Zρ which is given as ρ(g) = χρ(g)·E for all g ∈ Zρ. Apparently

χρ is a G-invariant character of Zρ which we call the central character of ρ.

[14], p. 124, Theorem 1 and
Let A be a proﬁnite abelian group. Then we know that (cf.
Theorem 2) the set of isomorphism classes PI(A) of projective irreducible representations
(for projective representation, see [7], §51) of A is in bijective correspondence with the set of
continuous alternating characters Alt(A). If ρ ∈ PI(A) corresponds to X ∈ Alt(A) then

and [A : Rad(X)] = dim(ρ)2,
where Rad(X) := {a ∈ A| X(a, b) = 1, for all b ∈ A}, the radical of X.

Ker(ρ) = Rad(X)

Let A := G/[G, G], so A is abelian. We also know from the composite map (2.6.1) ρ is a
projective irreducible representation of G and Zρ is the kernel of ρ. Therefore modulo com-
mutator group [G, G], we can consider that ρ is in PI(A) which corresponds an alternating
character X of A with kernel of ρ is Zρ/[G, G] = Rad(X). We also know that

[A : Rad(X)] = [G/[G, G] : Zρ/[G, G]] = [G : Zρ].

Then we observe that

dim(ρ) = dim(ρ) =

[G : Zρ].

(cid:113)

Let H be a subgroup of A, then we deﬁne the orthogonal complement of H in A with

respect to X

H⊥ := {a ∈ A : X(a, H) ≡ 1}.

An isotropic subgroup H ⊂ A is a subgroup such that H ⊆ H⊥ (cf.
[10], p. 270, Lemma
1(v)). And when isotropic subgroup H is maximal, we call H is a maximal isotropic for
X. Thus when H is maximal isotropic we have H = H⊥.

We also can show that the Heisenberg representations ρ are fully characterized by the

corresponding pair (Zρ, χρ).
Proposition 2.6.1 ([12], Proposition 4.2). The map ρ (cid:55)→ (Zρ, χρ) is a bijection between
equivalence classes of Heisenberg representations of G and the pairs (Zρ, χρ) such that
(a) Zρ ⊆ G is a coabelian normal subgroup,

(b) χρ is a G-invariant character of Zρ,
(c) X( ˆg1, ˆg2) := χρ(g1g2g−1

1 g−1

ˆg1, ˆg2 ∈ G/Zρ and their corresponding lifts g1, g2 ∈ G.

2 ) is a nondegenerate alternating character on G/Zρ where

For pairs (Zρ, χρ) with the properties (a)−(c), the corresponding Heisenberg representation

ρ is determined by the identity: (cid:113)

[G : Zρ] · ρ = IndG

Let C 1G = G, C i+1G = [C iG, G] denote the descending central series of G. Now assume
that every projective representation of A lifts to an ordinary representation of G. Then by I.
Schur’s results (cf. [7], p. 361, Theorem 53.7) we have (cf. [14], p. 124, Theorem 2):

1. Let A ∧Z A denote the alternating square of the Z-module A. The commutator map

A ∧Z A ∼= C 2G/C 3G, a ∧ b (cid:55)→ [ˆa, ˆb]

(2.6.3)

is an isomorphism.

2. The map ρ → Xρ ∈ Alt(A) from Heisenberg representations to alternating characters

on A is surjective.

Proof. (of the equation (2.6.2))

Let H be a maximal isotropic subgroup of G for the Heisenberg representation ρ and
[12], p. 193,

choose a character χH : H → C× such that χH|Zρ= χρ. Then we have (cf.
Proposition 5.3):

ρ = IndG

of χρ to H. We also know from the transitivity of induction:

(2.6.9)

Therefore, the equation (2.6.2) is proved.
Remark 2.6.2. Let χρ be a character of Zρ. All extensions χH ⊃ χρ are conjugate with respect
to G/H. This can be easily seen, since we know χH ⊃ χρ and χg
H(h) = χH(ghg−1). If we
take z ∈ Zρ, then we obtain

H(z) = χH(gzg−1) = χρ(gzg−1) = χρ(gzg−1z−1z)
χg

= χρ([g, z]z) = X(g, z) · χρ(z) = χρ(z),

since Zρ is a normal subgroup of G and the radical of X (i.e., X(g, z) = χρ([g, z]) = 1 for all
z ∈ Zρ and g ∈ G). Therefore, χg
H are extensions of χρ for all g ∈ G/H. It can also be seen
that the conjugates χg
= χH. So it
is enough to see that χg−1

H are all diﬀerent, because χg1

1. If G has no element of order 2, then α = e.

30

2. If G has a unique element t of order 2, then α = t.

3. If G has at least two elements of order 2, then α = e.

Let G be a two-step nilpotent group4. For this two-step nilpotent group, we have the

following lemma.
Lemma 2.7.2 ([24], p. 77, Lemma 9). Let G be a two-step nilpotent group and let x, y ∈ G.
Then

1. [xn, y] = [x, y]n, and

2. xnyn = (xy)n[x, y]

n(n−1)

,

for any n ∈ N.

We also need the elementary divisor theorem for this article which we take from [8]. Let

G be a ﬁnite abelian group. So G is ﬁnitely generated.

Theorem 2.7.3 ([8], p. 160, Theorem 3 (Invariant form)). Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group.
Then

G ∼= Z/n1 × Z/n2 × ··· × Z/ns.

(2.7.1)

for some integers n1, n2,··· , ns satisfying the following conditions:
(a) nj (cid:62) 2 for all j ∈ {1, 2,··· , s}, and
(b) ni+1|ni for all 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) s − 1.
And the expression in (2.7.1) is unique: if G ∼= Z/m1×Z/m2×···×Z/mr, where m1, m2,··· , mr
satisﬁes conditions (a) and (b), i.e., mj (cid:62) 2 for all j and mi+1|mi for all 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) r − 1, then
s = r and mi = ni for all i.

This theorem is known as the elementary divisor theorem of a ﬁnite abelian group.

Moreover, since G is direct product of Z/ni, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) s, then we can write

|G| = n1n2 ··· ns.

We also need a structure theorem for ﬁnite abelian groups which come provided with an

alternating character:

Lemma 2.7.4 ([10], p. 270, Lemma 1(VI)). Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group and assume
the existence of an alternating bi-character X : G × G → C× ( X(g, g) = 1 for all g ∈ G,
hence 1 = X(g1g2, g1g2) = X(g1, g2) · X(g2, g1)) which is nondegenerate. Then there will exist
elements t1, t(cid:48)

s ∈ G such that

4Its derived subgroup, i.e., commutator subgroup [G, G] is contained in its center.

In other worlds,
[G, [G, G]] = {1}, i.e., any triple commutator gives identity. If ρ is a Heisenberg representation of a ﬁnite
group G, then G/Ker(ρ) is a two-step nilpotent group (cf. p. 6).

2.8 Transfer map
Let H be a subgroup of a ﬁnite group G. Let {t1, t2,··· , tn} be a left transversal for H in G.
If g ∈ G then for all i = 1, 2,··· , n we obtain,

gti ∈ tg(i)H,

(2.8.1)
where the map i (cid:55)→ g(i) is a well-deﬁned permutation of the set {1, 2,··· , n}. Assume that
f : H → A is a homomorphism from H to an abelian group A. Then transfer of f , written
Tf , is a mapping

Tf (g) =(cid:81)n

Tf : G → A
i=1 f (t−1

g(i)gti)

given by

for all g ∈ G.

Since A is abelian, the order of the factors in the product is irrelevant. Since f is a homo-
morphism from H to A, from above we can see that Tf is a homomorphism G with abelian
image, and therefore always: [G, G] ⊆ Ker(Tf). Now we take f the canonical homomorphism,
i.e.,

f : H → H/[H, H], where [H, H] is the commutator subgroup of H.

And we denote Tf = TG/H. Thus by deﬁnition of transfer map TG/H : G → H/[H, H], given
by

Moreover, if H is any subgroup of ﬁnite index in G, then (cf. [9], Chapter 13, p. 183)

TG/gHg−1(g(cid:48)) = gTG/H(g(cid:48))g−1,

(2.8.3)
for all g, g(cid:48) ∈ G. Now let H be an abelian normal subgroup of G. Let H G/H be the set
consisting the elements which are invariant under conjugation. So it is clear that these
elements are central elements and H G/H ⊆ Z(G), the center of G. When H is abelian normal
subgroup of G, from equation (2.8.3) we can conclude that (cf. [9], Chapter 13, p. 183) that

Im(TG/H) ⊆ H G/H ⊆ Z(G).

(2.8.4)

We also need to mention the generalized Furtw¨angler’s theorem for this thesis.

32

Theorem 2.8.1 ([21], p. 320, Theorem 10.25). Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let TG/K : G →
K/[K, K] be the transfer homomorphism, where [G, G] ⊆ K ⊆ G. Then TG/K(g)[K:[G,G]] = 1
for all elements g ∈ G.

Now if [K : [G, G]] = 1, i.e., K = [G, G], we have TG/[G,G](g) = 1 for all g ∈ G, i.e.,
the transfer homomorphism of a ﬁnite group to its commutator is trivial. This is due to
Furtw¨angler. This is also known as Principal Ideal Theorem (cf. [9], p. 194).

To compute the determinant of an induced representation of a ﬁnite group, we need the

following theorem.

Theorem 2.8.2 (Gallagher, [17], Theorem 30.1.6). Let G be a ﬁnite group and H a subgroup
of G. Let ρ be a representation of H and denote ∆G

Computation of λ-functions

In this chapter we give explicit computation of λK/F , where K/F is a ﬁnite local Galois
extension. Two diﬀerent ways we can deﬁne λ-functions: One is directly from local constants,
and another one is via Deligne’s constants. We will use both of them according to our
convenience. In Section 3.2 we ﬁrst compute λ-function for odd degree Galois extension. And
in Section 3.4 we compute λ-functions for even degree tamely ramiﬁed Galois extensions. The
whole computation is based on the article [43].

3.1 Deligne’s Constants

Let K/F be a ﬁnite Galois extension of a local ﬁeld F of characteristic zero. Let G =
Gal(K/F ), and let ρ : G → AutC(V ) be a representation. Then for this representation,
Deligne (cf. [31], p. 119) deﬁnes:

c(ρ) :=

W (ρ, ψ)

W (det(ρ), ψ)

,

(3.1.1)

where ψ is some additive character of F . If we change the additive character ψ to ψ(cid:48) = bψ,
where b ∈ F ×, then from [6], p. 190, part (2) of the Proposition, we see:

W (ρ, bψ) = (ρ,

(3.1.2)
Also, from the property of abelian local constants we have W (det(ρ), bψ) = detρ(b)·W (detρ, ψ),
hence

, ψ) = detρ(b)W (ρ, ψ).

, bψ) = detρ(b) · (ρ,

1
2

W (ρ, bψ)

W (detρ, bψ) = W (ρ, ψ)

W (detρ, ψ) = c(ρ).

This shows that the Deligne’s constant c(ρ) does not depend on the choice of the additive
character ψ. We also have the following properties of Deligne’s constants:

Proposition 3.1.1 ([31], p. 119, Proposition 2).

(i) If dim(ρ) = 1, then c(ρ) = 1.

(ii)

c(ρ1 + ρ2) = c(ρ1)c(ρ2)W (det(ρ1))W (det(ρ2)) · W (det(ρ1) · det(ρ2))−1.

(3.1.3)

34

(iii) c(ρ + ρ) = det(ρ)(−1).
(iv) c(ρ) = c(ρ), and |c(ρ)| = 1.
(v) Suppose ρ = ρ. Then c(ρ) = ±1.

Now G be a ﬁnite group. Let ρ be an orthogonal representation of G, i.e., ρ : G → O(n).

We denote the i-th Stiefel-Whitney class of ρ by

si(ρ) ∈ H i(G, Z/2Z).

In low dimensions i, the Stiefel-Whitney class is given algebraically as follows (cf. [23], [38]):
Under the canonical isomorphism:

H 1(G, Z/2Z) ∼= Hom(G,{±1}),
If s1(ρ) is trivial, i.e., detρ ≡ 1, then s2(ρ) is the element of
the image of s1(ρ) is detρ.
H 2(G,{±1}) = H 2(G, Z/2Z) which is inverse image under ρ : G → SO(n) of the class of the
extension:

1 → {±1} → Spin(n) → SO(n) → 1,

where SO denotes the special orthogonal group and Spin the spinor group.

Now take G = Gal(K/F), for some ﬁnite Galois extension of local ﬁelds. In the following
theorem due to Deligne for an orthogonal representation ρ : G → O(n), we know a procedure
how to obtain out of s2(ρ) the constant c(ρ).

Theorem 3.1.2 (Deligne, [31], p. 129, Theorem 3). Let ρ be an orthogonal representation
of the ﬁnite group G and let s2(ρ) ∈ H 2(G, Z/2Z) be the second Stiefel-Whitney class of ρ.
The Galois group G = Gal(K/F ) is a quotient group of the full Galois group GF = Gal(F /F )
which induces an inﬂation map

Inf : H 2(G, Z/2Z) → H 2(GF , Z/2Z) ∼= {±1}.

Then

c(ρ) = cl(s2(ρ)) ∈ {±1}

(3.1.4)

(3.1.5)

is the image of the second Stiefel-Whitney class s2(ρ) under the inﬂation map (3.1.4).
In particular, we have c(ρ) = 1 if s2(ρ) = 0 ∈ H 2(G, Z/2Z).

3.2 When K/F is an odd degree Galois extension

We know that our local constant satisﬁes the following functional equation (cf. equation
(2.3.28))

Therefore, our λ-factor λG

H(W ) is always a fourth root of unity.

We also know that

det(IndG

HχH)(s) = εG/H(s) · (χH ◦ TG/H(s)),

where TG/H is the transfer map from G/[G, G] to H/[H, H] and εG/H(s) is the sign of s ∈ G
understood as permutation of ﬁnite set G/H : {gH (cid:55)→ sgH}. If we take χH = 1H the trivial
character of H then in particular see that

∆G

H(s) := det(IndG

H1H)(s)

is a character of G of order 2. If H ⊂ G is a normal subgroup then it is a character of the
factor group G/H and therefore it is trivial if G/H is of odd order.

More generally, from Gallagher’s Theorem 2.8.2, we have:

If ρ is a (virtual) representation of H, then

det(IndG

Hρ)(s) = ∆G

H(s)dim(ρ) · (detρ ◦ TG/H(s)),

(3.2.3)

for s ∈ G.

We assume now that the Galois groups H ⊂ G have the ﬁelds K ⊃ F as their base ﬁelds.
Then by class ﬁeld theory we may interpret det(ρ) of equation (3.2.3) as a character of K×
Hρ) as a character of F ×, and then the equation (3.2.3) turns into an equality of

can be interpreted by class-ﬁeld theory as a character of F ×. It is then character of F × corresponding to the

quadratic extension F ((cid:112)dK/F )/F , which is obtained by adjoining the square root of the discriminant dK/F

det ◦ IndG

H 1H = ∆K/F

of K/F .

36

∆E/F = det(IndG

H(IndH

Z 1Z),

and with ρ = IndH

Z 1Z we conclude from (3.2.4) that

∆E/F = ∆E/K|F × · ∆[E:K]
K/F .

Moreover, in terms of Deligne’s constant, we can write:

H := W (IndG
λG

H1H) = c(IndG

H1H) · W (det ◦ IndG

H1H).

(3.2.5)

(3.2.6)

Replacing Galois groups by the corresponding local ﬁelds we may write the lambda func-

tion of ﬁnite extension K/F as

λK/F = c(IndK/F 1) · W (∆K/F ),

(3.2.7)
where c(IndK/F 1) is Deligne’s sign, and ∆K/F is a quadratic character of F × related to the
discriminant.

Lemma 3.2.1. Let L/F be a ﬁnite Galois extension of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F and
G = Gal(L/F), H = Gal(L/K). If H (cid:54) G is a normal subgroup and if [G : H] is odd, then
∆K/F ≡ 1 and λ2

K/F = 1.

Proof. If H is a normal subgroup, then IndG
G/H, hence det◦ IndG
condition order of G/H is odd, then ∆K/F ≡ 1, hence λ2

{1} 1 is the regular representation of
H1H = ∆K/F is the quadratic character of the group G/H. By the given
K/F = ∆K/F (−1). Thus λ2

H1H = IndG/H

K/F = 1.

Note: Since ∆K/F ≡ 1, then W (∆K/F ) = 1. We also know that c(IndK/F(1)) ∈ {±1}.

Then from equation (3.2.7) we can easily see that λ2

K/F = 1.

In the next lemma we state some important results for our next Theorem 3.2.3. These are

the consequences of Deligne’s formula for the local constant of orthogonal representations.

Lemma 3.2.2.

1. If H (cid:54) G is a normal subgroup of odd index [G : H], then λG

H = 1.

2. If there exists a normal subgroup N of G such that N (cid:54) H (cid:54) G and [G : N ] odd, then

λG
H = 1.

Proof.

1. To prove (1) we use the equation (3.2.6)

H = W (IndG
λG

H1H) = c(IndG

H1H) · W (det ◦ IndG

H1H).

(3.2.8)

Since ρ = IndG
H1H is orthogonal we may compute c(ρ) by using the second Stiefel-
Whitney class s2(ρ) 2. From Proposition 3.1.1(v) we know that c(ρ) = W (ρ)/W (detρ)
is a sign. If cl(s2(ρ)) is the image of s2(ρ) under inﬂation map (which is injective), then
according to Deligne’s theorem 3.1.2, we have:

2This Stiefel-Whitney class s2(ρ) is easy accessible only if detρ ≡ 1, and this is in general wrong for
H 1H if H (cid:54) G is a normal subgroup and [G : H] is odd (by using

H 1H . But it is true for ρ = IndG

ρ = IndG
Lemma 3.2.1).

37

c(ρ) = cl(s2(ρ))

if ρ is orthogonal. Moreover, we have

s2(IndG

H1H) ∈ H 2(G/H, Z/2Z) = {1},

which implies that in equation (3.2.8) both factors are = 1, hence λG

H = 1.

2. From N (cid:54) H (cid:54) G we obtain

N = λH
λG

N · (λG

H)[H:N ]

(3.2.9)

From (1) we obtain λG
hence (λG
[H : N ] is odd.

N = λH

H)[H:N ] = 1. Finally this implies λG

N = 1 because N is normal and the index [G : N ] is odd,
H is 4th root of unity and

H = 1 because λG

Note: In the other words we can state this above Lemma 3.2.2 as follows:

Let H(cid:48) = ∩x∈∆xHx−1 ⊂ ∆ be the largest subgroup of H which is normal in ∆ ⊆ G. Then
H(W ) = 1 if the index [∆ : H(cid:48)] is odd, in particular if H itself is a normal subgroup of ∆ of
λ∆
odd index.

Now we are in a position to state the main theorem for odd degree Galois extension of a

non-archimedean local ﬁeld.

Theorem 3.2.3. Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld and E/F be an odd degree Galois
extension. If L ⊃ K ⊃ F be any ﬁnite extension inside E, then λL/K = 1.
Proof. By the given condition |Gal(E/F )| is odd. Then the degree of extension [E : F ] of
E over F is odd. Let L be any arbitrary intermediate ﬁeld of E/F which contains K/F .
Therefore, here we have the tower of ﬁelds E ⊃ L ⊃ K ⊃ F . Here the degree of extensions
are all odd since [E : F ] is odd. By assumption E/F is Galois, then also the extension E/L
and E/K are Galois and H = Gal(E/L) is subgroup of G = Gal(E/K).

By the deﬁnition we have λL/K = λG
H.

H = 1
because |G/H| is odd. But H need not be normal subgroup of G therefore L/K need not be
Galois extension. Let N be the largest normal subgroup of G contained in H and N can be
written as:

If H is a normal subgroup of G then λG

N = ∩g∈GgHg−1

Therefore, the ﬁxed ﬁeld EN is the smallest normal extension of K containing L. Now we
have from properties of λ-function(cf. 2.2(2)),

λG
N = λH

N · (λG

H)[H:Z].

(3.2.10)

This implies (λG
G contained in H. Therefore λG

H)[H:N ] = 1 since [H : N ] and [G : N ] are odd and N is normal subgroup of
H is 4th root of unity and [H : N ] is odd.

H = 1 because λG

38

Moreover, if N = {1}, it is then clear that N is a normal subgroup of G which sits in H and
[G : N ] = |G| is odd. Therefore Lemma 3.2.2(2) implies that λG

H = 1.

Then we may say λL/K = 1 all possible cases if [EN : K] is odd. When the big extension
E/F is odd then all intermediate extensions will be odd. Therefore, the theorem is proved
for all possible cases.

Remark 3.2.4. (1). If the Galois extension E/F is inﬁnite then we say it is odd if [K : F ]
is odd for all sub-extensions of ﬁnite degree. This means the pro-ﬁnite group Gal(E/F ) can
be realized as the projective limit of ﬁnite groups which are all odd order. If E/F is Galois
extension of odd order in this more general sense, then again we will have λL/K = 1 in all
cases where λ-function is deﬁned.
(2). When the order of a ﬁnite local Galois group is odd, all weak extensions are strong
extensions, because from the above Theorem 3.2.3 we have λG
1 = 1, where G is the odd order
local Galois group. Let H be a any arbitrary subgroup of G, then from the properties of
λ-functions we have

1 · (λG
H = 1, because |H| is odd, hence λH

λG
1 = λH

H)|H|.
1 = 1 and λ-functions are fourth roots of

This implies λG
unity.
(3). But this above Theorem 3.2.3 is not true if K/F is not Galois. Guy Henniart gives
“An amusing formula” (cf. [16], p. 124, Proposition 2) for λK/F , when K/F is arbitrary
odd degree extension, and this formula is:

λK/F = W (∆K/F )n ·

3.3 Computation of λG

group

Let G be a ﬁnite local Galois group of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . Now we consider
Langlands’ λ-function:

H := W (IndG
λG

H1H) = cG

H · W(∆G

(3.3.1)

where

H := c(IndG

H1H).

From the equation (3.3.1) we observe that to compute λG

necessary information for our further requirement.

H we need to compute the Deligne’s
H). By the following theorem due to Bruno Kahn we will get our

H and W (∆G

39

Theorem 3.3.1 ([4], S´erie 1-313, Theorem 1). Let G be a ﬁnite group, rG its regular repre-
sentation. Let S be any 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then s2(rG) = 0 in the following cases:

1. S is cyclic group of order (cid:62) 8;

2. S is generalized quaternion group;

3. S is not metacyclic group.

We also need Gallagher’s result.

Theorem 3.3.2 (Gallagher, [17], Theorem 30.1.8). Assume that H is a normal subgroup of
G, hence ∆G

, then

H = ∆G/H

1

1. ∆G

H = 1G, where 1G is the trivial representation of G, unless the Sylow 2-subgroups of

G/H are cyclic and nontrivial.

2. If the Sylow 2-subgroups of G/H are cyclic and nontrivial, then ∆G

H is the only linear

character of G of order 2.

Deﬁnition 3.3.3 (2-rank of a ﬁnite abelian group). Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group.
Then from elementary divisor Theorem 2.7.3 we can write

where m1|m2|···|ms and(cid:81)s

i=1 mi = |G|. We deﬁne

G ∼= Zm1 × Zm2 × ··· × Zms

(3.3.2)

the 2-rank of G :=the number of mi-s which are even

and we set

rk2(G) = 2-rank of G.

When the order of an abelian group G is odd, from the structure of G we have rk2(G) = 0,
i.e., there is no even mi-s for G. We also denote

G[2] := {x ∈ G| 2x = 0}, i.e., set of all elements of order at most 2.

If G = G1 × G2 × ··· × Gr, r ∈ N, is an abelian group, then we can show that

r(cid:89)

|G[2]| =

|Gi[2]|.

(3.3.3)

Remark 3.3.4 (Remark on Theorem 3.3.2). If G is a ﬁnite group with subgroups H(cid:48) ⊂
H ⊂ G then for ∆G

H1H) we know from Gallagher’s Theorem 2.8.2

H = det(IndG

i=1

∆G

H(cid:48) = det(IndG

H(cid:48)1H(cid:48)) = det(IndG

H(cid:48)1H(cid:48)))

H(IndH
H(cid:48)1H(cid:48)) ◦ TG/H

(3.3.4)

40

Now we use equation (3.3.4) for H(cid:48) = {1} and H = [G, G] = G(cid:48). Then we have

∆G

1 = (∆G

G(cid:48))|G(cid:48)| · ∆G(cid:48)

1 ◦ TG/G(cid:48) = (∆G

G(cid:48))|G(cid:48)|,

(3.3.5)

because by Theorem 2.8.1, TG/G(cid:48) is the trivial map.

We also know that G(cid:48) is a normal subgroup of G, then we can write IndG

G(cid:48)1G(cid:48) ∼= IndG/G(cid:48)

1

1,

hence ∆G

G(cid:48) = ∆G/G(cid:48)

. So we have

∆G

)|G(cid:48)|.

(3.3.6)

1 always reduces to the abelian case

1 1 = rG is the sum of all characters of G, hence from Miller’s result

From the above equation (3.3.6) we observe that ∆G
because G/G(cid:48) is abelian. Moreover, we know that:
If G is abelian then IndG

(cf. [36], Theorem 6) for the abelian group (cid:98)G we obtain:

(3.3.7)

where α is the uniquely determined quadratic character of G.

Lemma 3.3.5. The lambda function for a ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension of a non-archimedean
local ﬁeld is always a sign.

Proof. Let K be a ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . We know
that the unramiﬁed extensions are Galois, and their corresponding Galois groups are cyclic.
Let G = Gal(K/F), hence G is cyclic.

When the degree of K/F is odd, from Theorem 3.2.3 we have λG

1 = λK/F = 1 because

K/F is Galois.

When the degree of K/F is even, we have rk2(G) = 1 because G is cyclic. So from
1 = α, where α corresponds to the quadratic unramiﬁed
1 (−1) = α(−1) = 1, because −1 is a norm, hence from the functional

equation (3.3.7) we can write ∆G
extension. Then ∆G
equation (2.3.28) we have

(λG

1 )2 = 1.

Moreover, since G/G(cid:48) is abelian, by using equation (3.3.7) for G/G(cid:48), from equation (3.3.6)

we obtain:

Lemma 3.3.6. Let G be a ﬁnite group and S be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then the following
are equivalent:

41

1. S < G is nontrivial cyclic;

1 (cid:54)= 1, is the unique quadratic character of G;

2. ∆G
3. rk2(G/G(cid:48)) = 1 and |G(cid:48)| is odd.

Proof. Take H = {1} in Gallagher’s Theorem 3.3.2 and we can see that (1) and (2) are
equivalent. From equation (3.3.6) we can see (2) implies the condition (3).

Now we are left to show that (3) implies (1). Let S(cid:48) be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G/G(cid:48). Since
rk2(G/G(cid:48)) = 1, hence rk2(S(cid:48)) = 1, and therefore S(cid:48) is cyclic. Moreover, |G(cid:48)| is odd, hence
|S| = |S(cid:48)|. Let f : G → G/G(cid:48) be the canonical group homomorphism. Since |G(cid:48)| is odd, and
rk2(G/G(cid:48)) = 1, f|S is an isomorphism from S to S(cid:48). Hence S is a nontrivial cyclic Sylow
2-subgroup of G.

This completes the proof.

Theorem 3.3.7 (Schur-Zassenhaus). If H ⊂ G is a normal subgroup such that |H| and
[G : H] are relatively prime, then H will have a complement S that is a subgroup of G such
that

is a semidirect product.

G = H (cid:111) S

Let G be a local Galois group. Then it is known that G has Hall-subgroups (because G is
solvable), H ⊂ G of all types such that [G : H] and |H| are relatively prime. In particular, G
will have an odd Hall subgroup H ⊂ G such that |H| is odd and [G : H] is power of 2. From
this we conclude
Proposition 3.3.8. Let G be a ﬁnite local Galois group. Let H ⊂ G be an odd order Hall
subgroup of G (which is unique up to conjugation). Then we have

λG
1 = (λG
H if |H| ≡ 1 (mod 4) and λG

1 = (λG

H)|H|.
H)−1 if |H| ≡ 3 (mod 4).

(3.3.8)

1 = λG

Hence λG
If the local base ﬁeld F has residue characteristic p (cid:54)= 2, then the odd order Hall subgroup
, where G/H ∼= S is isomorphic to a
H ⊂ G is a normal subgroup and therefore λG
Sylow 2-subgroup of G. For G = Gal(E/F) this means that we have a unique normal extension
K/F in E such that Gal(K/F) is isomorphic to a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, and we will have

H = λG/H

1

λE/F = λ[E:K]
K/F .

Proof. We know that our local Galois group G is solvable, then G has an odd order Hall
1 = 1 (here |H| is odd and H
subgroup H ⊂ G. Then the formula (3.3.8) follows because λH
is a subgroup of the local Galois group G).

42

Let now p (cid:54)= 2 and let H be an odd order Hall subgroup of G. The ramiﬁcation subgroup
G1 ⊂ G is a normal subgroup of order a power of p, hence G1 ⊂ H, and H/G1 ⊂ G/G1 will
be an odd order Hall subgroup of G/G1. But the group G/G1 is supersolvable. It is also
well known that the odd order Hall subgroup of a supersolvable group is normal. Therefore
H/G1 is normal in G/G1, and this implies that H is normal in G. Now we can use Theorem
3.3.7 and we obtain G/H ∼= S, where S must be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Therefore when p (cid:54)= 2

we have

Lemma 3.3.9. Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld with p (cid:54)= 2. Let K/F be the uniquely determined
extension with V = Gal(K/F), Klein’s 4-group. Then
1 = λK/F = −1 if −1 ∈ F × is a square, i.e., qF ≡ 1 (mod 4), and
λV
1 = λK/F = 1 if −1 ∈ F × is not a square , i.e., if qF ≡ 3 (mod 4),
λV
where qF is the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of F .
Proof. If p (cid:54)= 2 then from Theorem 2.5.1 the square class group F ×/F ×2 is Klein’s 4-group,
and K/F is the unique abelian extension such that NK/F (K×) = F ×2, hence

Since V is abelian, we can write (cid:98)V ∼= V . This implies that there are exactly three nontrivial

Gal(K/F) ∼= F×/F×2 = V.

characters of V and they are quadratic. By class ﬁeld theory we can consider them as quadratic
characters of F ×. This each quadratic character determines a quadratic extension of F . Thus
there are three quadratic subextensions Li/F in K/F , where i = 1, 2, 3. We denote L1/F the
unramiﬁed extension whereas L2/F and L3/F are tamely ramiﬁed. Then we can write

λK/F = λK/Li · λ2

(3.3.9)
for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. The group V has four characters χi, i = 0,··· , 3, where χ0 ≡ 1 and
χi(i = 1, 2, 3) are three characters of V such that Gal(K/Li) is the kernel of χi, in other
words, χi is the quadratic character of F ×/NLi/F (L×
i ).

Let rV = IndV{1}1, then

because χ3 = χ1 · χ2. Therefore W (∆V

is Deligne’s constant. More precisely we have

λK/F = W (χ1) · W (χ2) · W (χ1χ2).

(3.3.10)

But here χ1 is unramiﬁed and therefore W (χ1) = χ1(c1) (see equation (2.3.6)) and by using
unramiﬁed character twisting formula, W (χ1χ2) = χ1(c2) · W (χ2), where c2 = πF c1 because
a(χ2) = 1 + a(χ1) = 1. Therefore the equation (3.3.10) implies:

λK/F = χ1(c1)2 · χ1(πF ) · W (χ2)2 = −χ2(−1),

(3.3.11)

1 χ3 = χ1χ3 and χ1χ2 = χ3 in the equation

since χ1(πF ) = −1. Similarly putting χ2 = χ−1
(3.3.10) we have

λK/F = −χ3(−1).

Therefore we have λK/F = −χi(−1) for i = 2, 3.

Moreover, we know that

1

χi(−1) =

if −1 ∈ F × is a square, i.e., qF ≡ 1

Thus ﬁnally we conclude that

λK/F = −χi(−1) =

In the following theorem we give a general formula of λG

Let S be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G.

1 = 1.

Proof. (1). When S = {1}, i.e., |G| is odd, we know from Theorem 3.2.3 that λG
(2). When S =< g > is a nontrivial cyclic subgroup of G, ∆G
(−1)
character of G. Then we obtain

1 (g) =
1 = α, where α is a uniquely determined quadratic

1 = 1.
1 is nontrivial (because ∆G

|S| = −1) and by Lemma 3.3.6, ∆G

|G|− |G|

1 = cG
λG

1 · W (∆G

1 ) = cG

1 · W (α).

If S is cyclic of order 2n (cid:62) 8, then by Theorem 3.3.1(case 1) and Theorem 3.1.2 we have
cG
1 = 1, hence λG
(3). The Sylow 2-subgroup S ⊂ G is metacyclic but not cyclic (invariant case):
If G contains Klein’s 4-group V , then V ⊂ S because all Sylow 2-subgroups are conjugate to
each other. Then we have V < S < G. So from the properties of λ-function we have

1 = W (α).

λG
1 = λV

1 · (λG

V )4 = λV
1 .

Now assume that G does not contain Klein’s 4-group. Then by assumption S is metacyclic,
not cyclic and does not contain Klein’s 4-group. We are going to see that this implies: S is
generalized quaternion, and therefore by Theorem 3.3.1, s2(IndG

1 (1)) = 0, hence cG

1 = 1.

We use the following criterion for generalized quaternion groups: A ﬁnite p-group in which
[35], p.

there is a unique subgroup of order p is either cyclic or generalized quaternion (cf.
189, Theorem 12.5.2).
So it is enough to show: If S does not contain Klein’s 4-group then S has precisely one
subgroup of order 2. Indeed, we consider the center Z(S) which is a nontrivial abelian 2-
group. If it would be non-cyclic then Z(S), hence S would contain Klein’s 4-group. So Z(S)
must be cyclic, hence we have precisely one subgroup Z2 of order 2 which sits in the center
of S. Now assume that S has any other subgroup U ⊂ S which is of order 2. Then Z2 and U
would generate a Klein-4-group in S which by our assumption cannot exist. Therefore Z2 ⊂ S
is the only subgroup of order 2 in S. But S is not cyclic, so it is generalized quaternion.
Thus we can write λG
that W (∆G
(4). The Sylow 2-subgroup S is nontrivial and not metacyclic.
We know that every cyclic group is also a metacyclic group. Therefore when S is nontrivial
and not metacyclic, we are not in the position: rk2(G/G(cid:48)) = 1 and |G(cid:48)| is odd. This gives
1 = 1, hence W (∆G
∆G
1 ) = 1. Furthermore by using the Theorem 3.3.1 and Theorem 3.1.2 we
obtain the second Stiefel-Whitney class s2(IndG

1 ). Now to complete the proof we need to show

1 ) = 1. This follows from Lemma 3.3.6.

1 · W (∆G

1 (1)) = 0, hence λG

1 ) = W (∆G

1 = cG

1 · W (∆G

1 = cG

1 ) = 1.

This completes the proof.

In the above Theorem 3.3.10 we observe that if we are in the Case 3, then by using
1 for p (cid:54)= 2. Moreover, by using Proposition

Lemma 3.3.9 we can give complete formula of λG
3.3.8 in case 2, we can come down the computation of λK/F , where K/F is quadratic.

Corollary 3.3.11. Let G = Gal(E/F) be a ﬁnite local Galois group of a non-archimedean

local ﬁeld F/Qp with p (cid:54)= 2. Let S ∼= G/H be a nontrivial Sylow 2-subgroup of G, where H is
ﬁelds such that S ∼= Gal(K/F), H = Gal(E/K) and G = Gal(E/F).

And if the 4th roots of unity are in the F , we have the same formulas as above but with
1 instead of ±1. Moreover, when p (cid:54)= 2, a precise formula for W (α) will be obtained in
Theorem 3.4.10.

3. The Case 4 of Theorem 3.3.10 will not occur in this case.

Proof. (1).

In the case when p (cid:54)= 2 we know from Proposition 3.3.8 that the odd Hall-
subgroup H < G is actually a normal subgroup with quotient G/H ∼= S. So if G = Gal(E/F)
and K/F is the maximal 2-extension inside E then Gal(K/F) = G/H ∼= S. And we obtain:

(3.3.15)

So it is enough to compute λK/F for Gal(K/F) ∼= S, i.e., we can reduce the computation to

the case where G = S.

K/F

We know that λK/F = W (IndK/F(1)) = (cid:81)

χ W(χ), where χ runs over all characters of
the cyclic group Gal(K/F). If [K : F ] = 2 then IndK/F(1) = 1 + α, where α is a quadratic
character of F associated to K by class ﬁeld theory, hence α = ∆K/F . Thus λK/F = W (α).
If [K : F ] = 4 then IndK/F(1) = 1 + β + β2 + β3, where β2 = α = ∆K/F and β3 = β−1,

hence by the functional equation of local constant we have:
W (β)W (β−1) = β(−1).

We then obtain:

λK/F = W (IndK/F(1)) = W(β)W(β2)W(β3) = β(−1) × W(α).

If S is cyclic of order 2n (cid:62) 8, then by Theorem 3.1.2, cS
we have W (∆S
character of F . Thus we obtain

1 = 1. Again from equation (3.3.7)
1 ) = W (α) because rk2(S) = 1, where α is the uniquely determined quadratic

λK/F = cS

1 · W (∆S

1 ) = W (α).

Finally by using the equation (3.3.15) we obtain our desired results.
Now we denote i =

√−1 and consider it in the algebraic closure of F . If i (cid:54)∈ F then p (cid:54)= 2
implies that F (i)/F is unramiﬁed extension of degree 2. Then we reach the case i ∈ F which
we have assumed.
Then ﬁrst of all we know that λG

H is always is a sign because

(λG

H)2 = ∆G

H(−1) = ∆G

H(i2) = 1.

Then the formula (3.3.15) turns into

where G/H = Gal(K/F) ∼= S. Therefore in Case 2 of Theorem 3.3.10 we have now same
formulas as above but with 1 instead of ±1.

(2). Moreover, when p (cid:54)= 2 we know that always λV

Again if V ⊆ S, hence V ⊆ G, and we have

λG
1 = λV

1 · (λG

1 .

1 = −1, if V ⊂ G,

Therefore, when S is metacyclic but not cyclic we can simply say:
λG
1 = λV
1 = 1, if V (cid:54)⊂ G.
λG
(3). If the base ﬁeld F is p-adic for p (cid:54)= 2 then as a Galois group S corresponds to a
tamely ramiﬁed extension (because the degree 2n is prime to p), and therefore S must be
metacyclic. Therefore the Case 4 of Theorem 3.3.10 can never occur if p (cid:54)= 2.

47

Remark 3.3.12. If S is cyclic of order 2n (cid:62) 8, then we have two formulas:
1 = W (α)±1 in Corollary 3.3.11. So we
λG
1 = W (α) as obtained in Theorem 3.3.10(2), and λG
observe that for |S| = 2n (cid:62) 8 and |H| ≡ −1 (mod 4) the value of W (α) must be a sign for
p (cid:54)= 2.

In Case 3 of Theorem 3.3.10 we notice that ∆G

1 takes values ±1 (cf. Proposition 3.1.1(v)). Moreover, we also notice
this Deligne’s constant cG
that the Deligne’s constant of a representation is independent of the choice of the additive
1 ∈ {±1} will not depend on the
character. Therefore in Case 3 of Theorem 3.3.10, λG
choice of the additive character. Since in Case 3 the computation of λG
1 does not depend on
the choice of the additive characters, hence we call this case as invariant case.

1 = cG

1 ≡ 1, hence λG

1 = cG

Furthermore, Bruno Kahn in his second paper (cf.

[4]) deals with s2(rG), where rG is a
regular representation of G in the invariant case. For metacyclic S of order (cid:62) 4, we have the
presentation

S ∼= G(n, m, r, l) =< a, b : a2n = 1, b2m = a2r, bab−1 = al >

with n, m (cid:62) 1, 0 (cid:54) r (cid:54) n, l an integer ≡ 1 (mod 2n−r), l2m ≡ l (mod 2n).

When S is metacyclic but not cyclic with n (cid:62) 2, then s2(rG) = 0 if and only if m = 1 and
l ≡ −1 (mod 4) (cf. [4], on p. 575 of the second paper). In this case our λG

(3.3.17)

Proof. This proof is straightforward from Theorem 3.3.10 and Corollary 3.3.11. Here S is
abelian and normal because G is abelian. When rk2(S) = 0, G is of odd order, hence λG
1 = 1.
When rk2(S) = 1, S is a cyclic group because S ∼= Z2n for some n (cid:62) 1. Then we are in the

Case 2 of Theorem 3.3.10. From the Case 4 of Corollary 3.3.11, we can say that the case
rk2(S) (cid:62) 3 will not occur here because p (cid:54)= 2 and G tame Galois group3.

3Here tame Galois group means a Galois group of a tamely ramiﬁed extension.

48

So we are left to check the case rk2(S) = 2. In this case S is metacyclic and contains
Klein’s 4-group, i.e., V ⊆ S ⊆ G. Then we have from the properties of λ-functions and

(3.3.18)

Remark 3.3.14. In Corollary 3.3.13 we observe that except the case rk2(S) = 1, the computa-
tion of λG
1 is explicit. Now let G = Gal(L/F), where L/F is a ﬁnite abelian Galois extension,
and K/F be a subextension in L/F for which Gal(L/K) = S. Since S is normal, K/F is
Galois extension of odd degree. Then when rk2(S) = 1 we have

λG
1 = λS

Again S is normal subgroup of G, hence G/S ∼= Gal(K/F). Hence

S = λG/S
λG

= λK/F = 1.

Moreover, λS

1 = λL/K. Then when rk2(S) = 1 we have

1 = λL/K,

where [L : K] = 2n (n (cid:62) 1).

From Theorem 3.3.10 and Corollaries 3.3.11, 3.3.13 for the case p (cid:54)= 2 we realize that the
1 in the case p (cid:54)= 2. In the
explicit computation of W (α) gives a complete computation of λG
following section we give explicit computation of λK/F , when K/F is an even degree Galois
extension.

3.4 Explicit computation of λK/F , where K/F is an even

degree Galois extension

Let K/F be a quadratic extension of the ﬁeld F/Qp. Let G = Gal(K/F ) be the Galois group
of the extension K/F . Let t be the ramiﬁcation break or jump (cf.
[26]) of the Galois
group G (or of the extension K/F ). Then it can be proved that the conductor of ωK/F (a
quadratic character of F × associated to K by class ﬁeld theory) is t + 1 (cf. [42], Lemma 3.1).
When K/F is unramiﬁed we have t = −1, therefore the conductor of a quadratic character
ωK/F of F × is zero, i.e., ωK/F is unramiﬁed. And when K/F is tamely ramiﬁed we have t = 0,
then a(ωK/F ) = 1. In the wildly ramiﬁed case (which occurs if p = 2) it can be proved that
a(ωK/F ) = t + 1 is, up to the exceptional case t = 2 · eF/Q2, always an even number
which can be seen by the following ﬁltration of F ×.

49

Let K/F be a quadratic wild ramiﬁed extension, hence p = 2. In F , we have the sequence
F ⊃ ··· of higher principal unit subgroups. Since ωK/F is a quadratic

F × ⊃ UF ⊃ U 1
character, it will be trivial on F ×2 therefore we need to consider the induced sequence

F ⊃ U 2

F × ⊃ UF F ×2 ⊃ U 1

F F ×2 ⊃ U 2

F F ×2 ⊃ ··· ⊃ F ×2.

In general, for any prime p, for F/Qp we have the following series

F × ⊃ UF F ×p ⊃ U 1

F F ×p ⊃ U 2

F F ×p ⊃ ··· ⊃ F ×p.

(S2)

(Sp)

Now we use Corollary 5.8 of [20] on p. 16, for the following: Let e = νF (p) = eF/Qp be the
absolute ramiﬁcation exponent of F . Then
F ⊂ F ×p, hence U i

F F ×p = F ×p.

(i) If i > pe

p−1 then U i

(ii) If i < pe

p−1 and i is prime to p, then in
1 → U i

F

(2)−→ U i

F · F ×p/U i+1

the arrow (1) is trivial and (2) is an isomorphism.

(iii) If i < pe

p−1 and p divides i, then arrow (1) is an isomorphism and (2) is trivial

F F ×p, where i is prime to p and i < pe
p−1.

Therefore the jumps in (Sp) occur at U i
(If

pe

p−1 is an integer, then i = pe
We now take p = 2, hence pe

p−1 is an exceptional case.)
p−1 = 2e. Then the sequence (Sp) turns into (S2) for all odd
numbers t < 2e or for t = 2e (the exceptional case). This means that in the wild ramiﬁed
case the conductor a(ωK/F ) = t + 1 will always be an even number (except when t = 2e).

From the following lemma we can see that λ-function can change by a sign if we change

the additive character.

Lemma 3.4.1. The λ-function can change by sign if we change the additive character.

Proof. Let K/F be a ﬁnite separable extension of the ﬁeld F and ψ be a nontrivial additive
character of F . We know that the local constant W (ρ, ψ) is well deﬁned for all pairs consisting
of a virtual representation ρ of the Weil group WF and a nontrivial additive character ψ of
F . If we change the additive character ψ to bψ, where b ∈ F × is a unique element for which
bψ(x) := ψ(bx) for all x ∈ F , then from equation (3.1.2), we have

W (ρ, bψ) = detρ(b) · W (ρ, ψ).

(3.4.2)

In the deﬁnition of λ-function ρ = IndK/F 1, therefore by using equation (3.4.2), we have

λK/F (bψ) = W (IndK/F 1, bψ) = ∆K/F (b)W (IndK/F 1, ψ) = ∆K/F (b)λK/F (ψ),

(3.4.3)
where ∆K/F = det(IndK/F (1)) is a quadratic character (a sign function), i.e., ∆K/F (b) ∈ {±1}.

50

In the following lemma we compute an explicit formula for λK/F (ψF ), where K/F is a
quadratic unramiﬁed extension of F . In general for any quadratic extension K/F , we can
write IndK/F 1 = 1F ⊕ ωK/F , where ωK/F is a quadratic character of F × associated to K by
class ﬁeld theory and 1F is the trivial character of F ×. Now by the deﬁnition of λ-function
we have:

λK/F = W (IndK/F 1) = W (ωK/F ).

(3.4.4)

So, λK/F is the local constant of the quadratic character ωK/F corresponding to K/F .
Lemma 3.4.2. Let K be the quadratic unramiﬁed extension of F/Qp and let ψF be the
canonical additive character of F with conductor n(ψF ). Then

λK/F (ψF ) = (−1)n(ψF ).

(3.4.5)

Proof. When K/F is quadratic unramiﬁed extension, it is easy to see that in equation (3.4.4)
ωK/F is an unramiﬁed character because here the ramiﬁcation break t is −1. Then from
equation (2.3.6) have:

Here νF (c) = n(ψF ). Therefore from equation (3.4.4) we obtain:

W (ωK/F ) = ωK/F (c).

(3.4.6)
We also know that πF /∈ NK/F (K×), and hence ωK/F (πF ) = −1. Therefore from equation
(3.4.6), we have

λK/F = ωK/F (πF )n(ψF ).

λK/F = (−1)n(ψF ).

(3.4.7)

For giving the generalized formula for λK/F , where K/F is an even degree unramiﬁed
extension, we need the following lemma, and here we give an alternative proof by using
Lemma 2.1.2.
Lemma 3.4.3 ([2], p. 142, Corollary 3). Let K/F be a ﬁnite extension and let DK/F be the
diﬀerent of this extension K/F . Let ψ be an additive character of F . Then

n(ψ ◦ TrK/F ) = eK/F · n(ψ) + νK(DK/F ).

(3.4.8)
Proof. Let the conductor of the character ψ ◦ TrK/F be m. This means from the deﬁnition of
conductor of additive character we have
ψ ◦ TrK/F|P −m
i.e., ψ(TrK/F (P −m

= 1 but ψ ◦ TrK/F|P −m−1
K )) = 1 but ψ(TrK/F (P −m−1

(cid:54)= 1,
)) (cid:54)= 1.

This implies

Therefore from the equation (3.4.9) we obtain:

This implies

m (cid:54) n(ψ) · eK/F + dK/F = n(ψ) · eK/F + νK(DK/F ),

(3.4.10)

since dK/F = νK(DK/F ).

Now we have to prove that the equality m = n(ψ) · eK/F + νK(DK/F ).

Let m = n(ψ) · eK/F + νK(DK/F ) − r, where r (cid:62) 0. Then we have

TrK/F (P

−n(ψ)·eK/F −dK/F +dK/F +r
K

) ⊆ P

−n(ψ)·eK/F
K

.

This implies r (cid:54) 0. Therefore r must be r = 0, because by assumption r (cid:62) 0. This proves
that

m = n(ψ ◦ TrK/F ) = eK/F · n(ψ) + νK(DK/F ).

Remark 3.4.4. If K/F is unramiﬁed, then eK/F = 1 and DK/F = OK, hence νK(DK/F ) =
νK(OK) = 0, therefore from the above Lemma 3.4.3 we have n(ψ ◦ TrK/F ) = n(ψ). Moreover,
if ψF = ψQp ◦ TrF/Qp, is the canonical additive character of F , then n(ψQp) = 0 and therefore

is the exponent of the absolute diﬀerent.

n(ψF ) = νF (DF/Qp)

Theorem 3.4.5. Let K/F be a ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension with even degree and let ψF be
the canonical additive character of F with conductor n(ψF ). Then

λK/F = (−1)n(ψF ).

(3.4.11)

Proof. When K/F is a quadratic unramiﬁed extension, by Lemma 3.4.2, we have λK/F =
(−1)n(ψF ). We also know that if K/F is unramiﬁed of even degree then we have precisely one
subextension K(cid:48)/F in K/F such that [K : K(cid:48)] = 2. Then

λK/F = λK/K(cid:48) · (λK(cid:48)/F )2 = λK/K(cid:48) = (−1)n(ψK(cid:48) ) = (−1)n(ψF ),

because in the unramiﬁed case λ-function is always a sign (cf. Lemma 3.3.5), and from Lemma
3.4.3, n(ψK(cid:48)) = n(ψF ).

This completes the proof.

52

In the following corollary, we show that the above Theorem 3.4.5 is true for any nontrivial

arbitrary additive character.

Corollary 3.4.6. Let K/F be a ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension of even degree and let ψ be any
nontrivial additive character of F with conductor n(ψ). Then

λK/F (ψ) = (−1)n(ψ).

(3.4.12)

Proof. We know that any nontrivial additive character ψ is of the form, for some unique
b ∈ F ×, ψ(x) := bψF (x), for all x ∈ F . By the deﬁnition of conductor of additive character
of F , we obtain:

n(ψ) = n(bψF ) = νF (b) + n(ψF ).

Now let G = Gal(K/F) be the Galois group of the extension K/F . Since K/F is unramiﬁed,
then G is cyclic. Let S be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Here S is nontrivial cyclic because the
1 = ∆K/F (cid:54)≡ 1.
degree of K/F is even and G is cyclic. Then from Lemma 3.3.6 we have ∆G
Therefore ∆K/F (b) = (−1)νF (b) is the uniquely determined unramiﬁed quadratic character of
F ×. Now from equation (3.4.3) we have:
λK/F (ψ) = λK/F (b · ψF )

= ∆K/F (b)λK/F (ψF )
= (−1)νF (b) × (−1)n(ψF ),
= (−1)νF (b)+n(ψF )
= (−1)n(ψ).

from Theorem 3.4.5

Therefore when K/F is an unramiﬁed extension of even degree, we have

λK/F (ψ) = (−1)n(ψ),

(3.4.13)

where ψ is any nontrivial additive character of F .

In the following theorem we give an explicit formula of λK/F , when K/F is an even degree

Galois extension with odd ramiﬁcation index.

Theorem 3.4.7. Let K be an even degree Galois extension of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld
F of odd ramiﬁcation index. Let ψ be a nontrivial additive character of F . Then

λK/F (ψ) = (−1)n(ψ).

(3.4.14)

Proof. In general, any extension K/F of local ﬁelds has a uniquely determined maximal
subextension F (cid:48)/F in K/F which is unramiﬁed. If the degree of K/F is even, then certainly
we have eK/F = [K : F (cid:48)] because eK/F = eF (cid:48)/F · eK/F (cid:48) = eK/F (cid:48) and K/F (cid:48) is a totally
ramiﬁed extension. By the given condition, here K/F is an even degree Galois extension with
odd ramiﬁcation index eK/F , hence K/F (cid:48) is an odd degree Galois extension. Now from the
properties of λ-function and Theorem 3.2.3 we have

53

λK/F = λK/F (cid:48) · (λF (cid:48)/F )eK/F = (−1)eK/F ·n(ψF ) = (−1)n(ψF ),

because K/F (cid:48) is an odd degree Galois extension and F (cid:48)/F is an unramiﬁed extension.

3.4.1 Computation of λK/F , where K/F is a tamely ramiﬁed quadratic

extension

The existence of a tamely ramiﬁed quadratic character (which is not unramiﬁed) of a local
ﬁeld F implies p (cid:54)= 2 for the residue characteristic. But then by Theorem 2.5.1

F ×/F ×2 ∼= V

is isomorphic to Klein’s 4-group. So we have only 3 nontrivial quadratic characters in that
case, corresponding to 3 quadratic extensions K/F . One is unramiﬁed and other two are
ramiﬁed. The unramiﬁed case is already settled (cf. Lemma 3.4.2). Now we have to address
the quadratic ramiﬁed characters. These two ramiﬁed quadratic characters determine two
diﬀerent quadratic ramiﬁed extensions of F .
In the ramiﬁed case we have a(χ) = 1 because it is tame, and we take ψ of conductor −1.
Then we have a(χ)+n(ψ) = 0 and therefore in the deﬁnition of W (χ, ψ) (cf. equation (2.3.4))
we can take c = 1. So we obtain:

W (χ, ψ) = q

where χ is the quadratic character of the residue ﬁeld k×
F , and ψ is an additive character of
kF . When n(ψ) = −1, we observe that both the ramiﬁed characters χ give the same
χ, hence the same W (χ, ψ), because one is diﬀerent from other by a quadratic unramiﬁed
character twist. To compute an explicit formula for λK/F (ψ−1), where K/F is a tamely
ramiﬁed quadratic extension and ψ−1 is an additive character of F with conductor −1, we
need to use classical quadratic Gauss sums.

Now let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld. Let ψ−1 be an additive character of F of
conductor −1, i.e., ψ−1 : F/PF → C×. Now restrict ψ−1 to OF , it will be one of the characters
a · ψqF , for some a ∈ k×
and usually it will not be ψqF itself. Therefore choosing ψ−1 is very
important and we have to choose ψ−1 such a way that its restriction to OF is exactly ψqF .
Then we will be able to use the quadratic classical Gauss sum in our λ-function computation.
We also know that there exists an element c ∈ F × such that

qF

ψ−1 = c · ψF

induces the canonical character ψqF on the residue ﬁeld kF .

Now question is: Finding proper c ∈ F × for which ψ−1|OF = c · ψF|OF = ψqF , i.e., the

canonical character of the residue ﬁeld kF .

From the deﬁnition of conductor of the additive character ψ−1 of F , we obtain from the

construction (3.4.16)

− 1 = νF (c) + n(ψF ) = νF (c) + dF/Qp.

(3.4.17)

In the next two lemmas we choose the proper c for our requirement.
Lemma 3.4.8. Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld and let ψ−1 be an additive character of F of conductor
−1. Let ψF be the canonical character of F . Let c ∈ F × be any element such that −1 =
νF (c) + dF/Qp, and

,

TrF/F0(c) =

(3.4.18)
where F0/Qp is the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in F/Qp. Then the restriction of ψ−1 =
c · ψF to OF is the canonical character ψqF of the residue ﬁeld kF of F .
Proof. Since F0/Qp is the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in F/Qp, we have πF0 = p,
∼= kF , because F/F0 is totally
and the residue ﬁelds of F and F0 are isomorphic, i.e., kF0
ramiﬁed extension. Then every element of OF /PF can be considered as an element of OF0/PF0.
Moreover, since F0/Qp is the maximal unramiﬁed extension, then from Proposition 2 of [2]
on p. 140, for x ∈ OF0 we have

1
p

ρp(TrF0/Qp(x)) = TrkF0 /kQp

(ρ0(x)),

where ρ0, ρp are the canonical homomorphisms of OF0 onto kF0, and of OQp onto kQp, respec-
tively. Then for x ∈ kF0 we can write

TrF0/Qp(x) = TrkF0 /kQp

(x).

(3.4.19)

Furthermore, since F/F0 is totally ramiﬁed, we have kF = kF0, then the trace map for the
tower of the residue ﬁelds kF /kF0/kQp is:

(x),
for all x ∈ kF . Then from the equations (3.4.19) and (3.4.20) we obtain

(x) = TrkF0 /kQp

(x) = TrkF0 /kQp

TrkF/kQp

◦ TrkF/kF0

TrF0/Qp(x) = TrkF/kQp

(x)

(3.4.20)

(3.4.21)

for all x ∈ kF .

Since the conductor of ψ−1 is −1, for x ∈ OF /PF (= OF0/PF0 because F/F0 is totally

55

ramiﬁed) we have

ψ−1(x) = c · ψF (x)
= ψF (cx)

= ψQp(TrF/Qp(cx))
= ψQp(TrF0/Qp ◦ TrF/F0(cx))
= ψQp(TrF0/Qp(x · TrF/F0(c)))
= ψQp(TrF0/Qp(

This competes the lemma.

The next step is to produce good elements c more explicitly. By using Lemma 3.4.8, in

the next lemma we see more general choices of c.
Lemma 3.4.9. Let F/Qp be a tamely ramiﬁed local ﬁeld and let ψ−1 be an additive character
of F of conductor −1. Let ψF be the canonical character of F . Let F0/Qp be the maximal
unramiﬁed subextension in F/Qp. Let c ∈ F × be any element such that −1 = νF (c) + dF/Qp,
then

c(cid:48) =

c
TrF/F0

(pc),

fulﬁlls conditions (3.4.17), (3.4.18), and hence ψ−1|OF = c(cid:48) · ψF|OF = ψqF .
Proof. By the given condition we have νF (c) = −1 − dF/Qp = −1 − (eF/Qp − 1) = −eF/Qp.
u(c) = p−1u(c) for some u(c) ∈ UF because F/Qp is tamely

. Then we can write

−eF/Qp

TrF/F0(pc) = p · TrF/F0(c) = p · p−1u0(c) = u0(c) ∈ UF0 ⊂ UF,

where u0(c) = TrF/F0(u(c)), hence νF (TrF/F0(pc)) = 0. Then the valuation of c(cid:48) is:

νF (c(cid:48)) = νF (

c
TrF/F0

(pc)) = νF (c) − νF (TrF/F0(pc))

= νF (c) − 0 = νF (c) = −1 − dF/Qp.

Since TrF/F0(pc) = u0(c) ∈ UF0, we have
(pc)) =

TrF/F0(c(cid:48)) = TrF/F0(

56

Thus we observe that here c(cid:48) ∈ F × satisﬁes equations (3.4.17) and (3.4.18). Therefore
from Lemma 3.4.8 we can see that ψ−1|OF = c(cid:48) · ψF|OF is the canonical additive character of
kF .

By Lemmas 3.4.8 and 3.4.9 we get many good (in the sense that ψ−1|OF = c·ψF|OF = ψqF )
elements c which we will use in our next theorem to calculate λK/F , where K/F is a tamely
ramiﬁed quadratic extension.
Theorem 3.4.10. Let K be a tamely ramiﬁed quadratic extension of F/Qp with qF = ps.
Let ψF be the canonical additive character of F . Let c ∈ F × with −1 = νF (c) + dF/Qp, and
c(cid:48) =
(pc), where F0/Qp is the maximal unramiﬁed extension in F/Qp. Let ψ−1 be an
additive character of F with conductor −1, of the form ψ−1 = c(cid:48) · ψF . Then

(3.4.22)

Here ”overline” stands for modulo PF0.

Proof. From equation (3.4.3) we have

λK/F (ψ−1) = λK/F (c(cid:48)ψF ) = ∆K/F (c(cid:48)) · λK/F (ψF ).

Since ∆K/F is quadratic, we can write ∆K/F = ∆−1

K/F . So we obtain

λK/F (ψF ) = ∆K/F (c(cid:48)) · λK/F (ψ−1).

Now we have to compute λK/F (ψ−1), and which we do in the following:
Since [K : F ] = 2, we have IndK/F(1) = 1F ⊕ ωK/F. The conductor of ωK/F is 1 because
K/F is a tamely ramiﬁed quadratic extension, and hence t = 0, so a(ωK/F ) = t + 1 = 1.
Therefore we can consider ωK/F as a character of F ×/U 1
F . So the restriction of ωK/F to
UF , res(ωK/F) := ωK/F|UF, we may consider as the uniquely determined character of k×
of order 2. Since c(cid:48) satisﬁes equations (3.4.17), (3.4.18), then from Lemma 3.4.9 we have
ψ−1|OF = c(cid:48) · ψF|OF = ψqF , and this is the canonical character of kF . Then from equation

We also can write ∆K/F = det(IndK/F(1)) = det(1F ⊕ ωK/F) = ωK/F. So we have

∆K/F (πF ) = ωK/F (πF ) = 1,

(3.4.23)

(3.4.24)

Under the assumption of the Theorem 3.4.10 we have πF ∈ NK/F (K×), ∆K/F = ωK/F and

c(cid:48) =

Note: When we are in the Case 1 of Corollary 3.3.11, by using this above Theorem 3.4.10
we can give explicit formula for λK/F , because here the quadratic extensions are tamely
ramiﬁed (since p (cid:54)= 2).

58

Remark 3.4.11. When p (cid:54)= 2, for any non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp we know that the
square class group F ×/F ×2 ∼= V Klein’s 4-group. If K is the abelian extension of F with
NK/F (K×) = F ×2, then from Lemma 3.3.9 we can see that λK/F depends on the choice of the
base ﬁeld F . Now we put λi = λLi/F , where Li/F are quadratic extension of F , i = 1, 2, 3.
Let ψ be an additive character of F . From a direct computation we can write

λK/F (ψ) = W (IndK/F 1, ψ) = W (χ1, ψ)W (χ2, ψ)W (χ3, ψ) = λ1(ψ)λ2(ψ)λ3(ψ).

(3.4.25)

On the other hand from Lemma 3.3.9 we see:

λK/F (ψ) = −λ2(ψ)2 = −λ3(ψ)2.

(3.4.26)

Comparing these two expressions we obtain:

λ1(ψ)λ3(ψ) = −λ2(ψ), and λ1(ψ)λ2(ψ) = −λ3(ψ).

Moreover, since L1/F is unramiﬁed, therefore from Lemma 3.4.2 we have λ1(ψ) = (−1)n(ψ).
So we observe:
(a) The three conditions: n(ψ) odd, λ1(ψ) = −1, and λ2(ψ) = λ3(ψ) are equivalent.
(b) In the same way, the conditions: n(ψ) even, λ1(ψ) = 1 and λ2(ψ) = −λ3(ψ) are

equivalent.

Let µ4 denote the group generated by a fourth root of unity. Then we have more equivalences:
(c) qF ≡ 1 (mod 4), µ4 ⊂ F × and λ2(ψ)2 = λ3(ψ)2 = 1 are three equivalent conditions.
(d) qF ≡ 3 (mod 4), µ4 (cid:54)⊂ F × and λ2(ψ)2 = λ3(ψ)2 = −1 are also three equivalent condi-

tions.

This gives us four disjoint cases: We can have (a) and (c) or (a) and (d) or (b) and (c)
or (b) and (d).

We can put all these four disjoint cases into the following table:

n(ψ) λK/F λ1

qF ≡ 1 (mod 4) odd −1
qF ≡ 1 (mod 4) even −1
qF ≡ 3 (mod 4) odd

In the case p = 2, the square class group of F , i.e., F ×/F ×2 can be large, so we can have
many quadratic characters but they are wildly ramiﬁed, not tame. Let F = Q2, then we have

Z2 × Z2 is not cyclic. So from Theorems 3.3.1, and 3.1.2 we have cG

Moreover, from Theorem 2.5.2, if F/Q2, we have |F ×/F ×2| = 2m, (m (cid:62) 3), therefore more

generally we obtain the following result.
Theorem 3.4.13. Let F be an extension of Q2. Let K be the abelian extension for which
NK/F (K×) = F ×2. Then λK/F = 1.

Proof. This proof is same as the above Lemma 3.4.12. Let G = Gal(K/F). From Theorem
2.5.2 we have rk2(G) (cid:54)= 1 and G is not metacyclic. Therefore by using Theorems 3.3.1, and
3.1.2 we can conclude that λK/F = λG
Example 3.4.14 (Computation of λL/Q2, where L/Q2 is a quadratic extension). Let

and the index is always 2. So we have

22 − 2 = 2 characters χ2, χ3 with a(χi) = 2, i = 2, 3,

23 − 22 = 4 characters χ4,··· , χ7 with a(χi) = 3, i = 4,··· , 7.

60

The last case is the exceptional case (cf. p. 50) because p = 2, e = 1 gives i = pe
Here we will have odd conductor. We can simplify as follows:

p−1 = 2.

We denote G = Gal(K/F) ∼= Q×
χ0, χ1, χ2,··· , χ7}, where χ2

χ1, χ2, χ3 = χ1χ2, χ4, χ5 = χ1χ4, χ6 = χ2χ4, and χ7 = χ1χ2χ4.

i = 1, i = 1, 2,··· , 7. So we can write

2. Since G is abelian, then G ∼= (cid:98)G, namely (cid:98)G = {1 =

Again from Lemma 3.4.12 we have λK/F = 1. Thus we can write

where λi = λKi/F and Ki/F is the corresponding quadratic extension of character χi for i =
1, 2,··· , 7. Moreover, there is an unramiﬁed quadratic extension of Q2, namely K1/Q2 which
corresponds χ1. Then λ1 = λK1/Q2 = (−1)n(ψQ2 ) = 1, because the conductor n(ψQ2) = 0. We
also have

λ2 = W (χ2), λ3 = W (χ3),··· , λ7 = W (χ7).

Then we obtain

7(cid:89)

λK/Q2(ψQ2) =

λi

= W (χ2)2 · W (χ4)2 · W (χ2χ4)2
= 1,

since n(ψQ2) = 0 and λK/Q2 = 1.

Now we have to give explicit computation of λi, where i = 1,··· , 7. For this particular
example directly we can give explicit computation of λi by using the modiﬁed formula (2.3.4)
of abelian local constant. Before going to our explicit computation we need to recall few
facts. Suppose that χ is a multiplicative character of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp of
conductor n. Then we can write

W (χ, ψF ) = χ(πn+n(ψF )

F can be written as

x = a0 + a1πF + a2π2

When F = Q2, we have a(χ2) = a(χ3) = 2 and a(χi) = 3, (i = 4,··· , 7). Therefore we

can write
UQ2/U 2Q2 = {1, 1 + 2} = {1, 3},
We also know that any square element x in Q×
and n is a 2-adic integer. This tells us ±2,−1 and ±5 are not square in Q×
πF = 2 as a uniformizer, then we can write

UQ2/U 3Q2 = {1, 1 + 2, 1 + 22, 1 + 2 + 22} = {1, 3, 5, 7}.
2 is of the form x = 4m(1 + 8n), where m ∈ Z

Now our next job is to see the norm groups of the above quadratic extensions of Q2. For any
ﬁnite extension K/F , we denote NK/F := NK/F (K×), the norm group of the extension K/F .
So we can write:

Remark 3.4.15. Finally we observe that Theorem 3.3.10 and Corollary 3.3.11 are the general
results on λG
1 = λE/F , where E/F is a Galois extension with Galois group G = Gal(E/F).
And the general results leave open the computation of W (α), where α is a quadratic
character of G. For such a quadratic character we can have three cases:

1. unramiﬁed, this is the Theorem 3.4.5,

2. tamely ramiﬁed, this is the Theorem 3.4.10,

3. wildly ramiﬁed, its explicit computation is still open.

We also observe from the above example 3.4.14 that giving explicit formula for λK/F , where
K/F is a wildly ramiﬁed quadratic extension, is very subtle. In particular, when F = Q2, in
the above Example (3.4.14) we have the explicit computation of λK/Q2.

Chapter 4

Determinant of Heisenberg
representations

In this chapter we give an invariant formula of determinant of a Heisenberg representation ρ
of a ﬁnite group G modulo Ker(ρ). The group G need not be a two-step nilpotent group, but
under modulo Ker(ρ), G is a two-step nilpotent group. In this chapter ﬁrstly we compute
transfer map for two-step nilpotent group. Then we compute det(ρ) modulo Ker(ρ), because
G is always a two-step nilpotent group under modulo Ker(ρ). This chapter is based on the
article [45].

4.1 Explicit computation of the transfer map for two-

step nilpotent group

Let G be a ﬁnite group with [G, [G, G]] = {1}. Let H be a normal subgroup of G, with
abelian quotient group G/H of order d. If d is odd, then in the following lemma we compute
TG/H(g) for all g ∈ G.

Lemma 4.1.1. Assume that G is a ﬁnite group and H a normal subgroup such that

1. H is abelian,

2. G/H is abelian of odd order d,
3. [G, [G, G]] = {1}.

Then we have TG/H(g) = gd for all g ∈ G.
As a consequence one has [G, G]d = {1}, in other words, Gd is contained in the center of G.

Proof. In general, we know that transfer map is independent of the choice of the left transver-
sal for H in G. So we take T as a transversal1 for H in G. By the given condition H is normal,

1Since H is normal, left cosets and right cosets are the same, so we can simply call transversal instead of

specifying left or right transversal.

65

we have T ∼= G/H and G = T H, where T H = {th | t ∈ T, h ∈ H}. This shows that every
element g ∈ G can uniquely be written as g = th, where t ∈ T and h ∈ H.

First assume g = h ∈ H. Then we have

ht = t · t−1ht ∈ tH,

because H is a normal subgroup of G. Hence s = t, where s = s(t) is a function of t which is
uniquely determined by gt ∈ sH, for some g ∈ G. Therefore:

TG/H(h) =

s−1ht =

(4.1.1)

We have used the condition (3) in the last two equalities which means that commutators are
in the center. Now we use that G/H is of odd order, hence x = 1 if x ∈ G/H is an element
such that x = x−1, i.e., G/H has no self-inverse element. Therefore from Theorem 2.7.1, we
t∈T t = 1 ∈ G/H, hence TG/H(h) = hd. Proceeding with the proof of the

t∈T t−1 =(cid:81)

have(cid:81)

Lemma we have now

TG/H(th) = TG/H(t) · TG/H(h) = TG/H(t) · hd.

(4.1.2)

Moreover, from Lemma 2.7.2 we can write
d(d−1)

tdhd = (th)d[t

2

, h] = (th)d[e, h] = (th)d,

since [G, G] ⊆ Z(G) and d is odd2. So we are left to show that TG/H(t) = td for all t ∈ T .

Since G/H is an abelian group of odd order, hence we may write

G/H = C × U ,

where C is cyclic group of odd order m|d, and we assume t ∈ T such that tH is a generator
of C. Then our transversal system can be chosen as

T = {tiu|i = 0, 1,··· , m − 1, uH ∈ U}.

Now if i (cid:54) m− 2 we have t· tiu = ti+1 · u = s, hence s−1 · t· tiu = 1. But i = m− 1 we obtain

hence

TG/H(t) =

t(tm−1u) = tmu ∈ uH,

u−1t(tm−1u) = u−1tmu,

and the order of group G/H is d. So for any t ∈ G/H, t

We also know that any g ∈ G can uniquely be written as g = th, where t ∈ T and h ∈ H.

Then ﬁnally we obtain:

TG/H(g) = TG/H(th) = TG/H(t) · TG/H(h) = td · hd = (th)d[t

(4.1.4)
Moreover, by our assumption (2), we have G/H is an abelian group, therefore [G, G] ⊆ H,
in particular, TG/H(h) = hd for h ∈ [G, G] ⊆ H. On the other hand, from Theorem 2.8.1
TG/[G,G] is trivial. So under the above Lemma’s conditions we conclude [G, G]d = 1, in other
words, Gd is in the center because due to condition (3) the commutator is bilinear.

Remark 4.1.2. From Lemma 4.1.1 we have TG/H(g) = gd for all g ∈ G. This implies for
g1, g2 ∈ G

TG/H(g1g2) = (g1g2)d, on the other hand,
TG/H(g1g2) = TG/H(g1) · TG/H(g2) = gd

because TG/H is a homomorphism. Hence for all g1, g2 ∈ G we have

(g1g2)d = gd

2.

This implies Gd is actually a subgroup of G not only a subset.

By combining Lemma 4.1.1 and the elementary divisor theorem, we have the following

result.

Lemma 4.1.3. Assume that G is a ﬁnite group and H a normal subgroup such that

1. H is abelian

2. G/H is abelian of order d, such that (according to the elementary divisor theorem):

G/H ∼= Z/m1 × ··· × Z/ms

where m1|···|ms and(cid:81)
tiH ∈ G/H generates the cyclic factor ∼= Z/mi, hence tmi

i ∈ H.

i mi = d. Moreover, we ﬁx elements t1, t2,··· , ts ∈ G such that

3. [G, [G, G]] = {1}. In particular, [G, G] is in the center Z(G) of G.

Then each g ∈ G has a unique decomposition

over all elements from G/H.
Here we mean [tmi
The commutators are independent of the choice of the representatives and are always

and (ii) we always obtain

TG/H(g) = gd · ϕG/H(g),

where ϕG/H(g) ∈ Z(G) is an element of order (cid:54) 2.

As a consequence of the second equality in (ii) combined with [G, G] ⊆ H ∩ Ker(TG/H), one
has [G, G]d = {1}, in other words, Gd is contained in the center Z(G) of G.

Proof. By the given conditions, we have the abelian group G/H of order d with

G/H ∼= Z/m1 × ··· × Z/ms

where m1|···|ms and (cid:81)
i mi = d. Moreover, we ﬁx elements t1, t2,··· , ts ∈ G such that
tiH ∈ G/H generates the cyclic factor ∼= Z/mi, hence tmi
i ∈ H. Therefore for a ﬁxed
i ∈ {1, 2,··· , s} we can deﬁne a subgroup Ci ⊂ G/H such that Ci is complementary to the
cyclic subgroup < ti > of order mi mod H, i.e., G/H =< tiH > ×Ci.

Then for a ﬁxed i ∈ {1, 2,··· , s}, we can choose a transversal system for H in G and

(4.1.5)

(4.1.6)

2 ∈ H, and the commutator [., .] is bilinear by assumption (3), hence

We also know that every g ∈ G can be uniquely written as th, where t ∈ G/H and h ∈ H.

By the assumption (2), G/H is an abelian group, hence [G, G] ⊆ H. And from equation
(4.1.8) we have TG/H(h) = hd[h, α]. This implies for [G, G] ⊆ Ker(TG/H), hence [G, G] ⊆
H ∩ Ker(TG/H). On the other hand in general TG/H : G → H/[H, H] is a homomorphism with
values in an abelian group, hence it is trivial on commutators. So under the assumptions we
can say [G, G]d = {1}, in other words, Gd is in the center Z(G) because due to assumption
(3) the commutator is bilinear. Let Z2 be the set of all elements of Z(G) of order (cid:54) 2. Since
Gd ⊆ Z(G), then by using Lemma 2.7.2(2) with n = d, we obtain

(mod Z2) by equation (4.1.10)

where ϕG/H is a correcting function with values in Z2.

Remark 4.1.4 (Properties of the correcting function ϕG/H). (i) The correcting function
ϕG/H is a function on G/G2[G, G] with values in Z2.

Proof. From Lemma 4.1.3 we have

TG/H(g) = gdϕG/H(g),

(4.1.11)

where ϕG/H(g) is the correcting function.

We have here [G, [G, G]] = {1}. This implies [g, z] = 1 for all g ∈ G and z ∈ [G, G]. Since

[G, G] ⊆ Ker(TG/H), then for all x ∈ [G, G] we have

TG/H(gx) = TG/H(g)TG/H(x) = TG/H(g)

for all g ∈ G.

Also here we have [G, G]d = {1}, then by using Lemma 2.7.2(2) for x ∈ [G, G] we can write

(gx)d = gdxd[g, x]− d(d−1)

2 = gd

for all g ∈ G.

From Lemma 4.1.3 we also have TG/H((gx)d) = (gx)dϕG/H(gx). By comparing these above
equations for x ∈ [G, G] we obtain

ϕG/H(gx) = ϕG/H(g)
Moreover, if x ∈ G2, from Lemma 4.1.3 we have

for all g ∈ G.

TG/H(x) = xdϕG/H(x) = xd since ϕG/H(x) = 1 ∈ Z2

So TG/H(gx) = TG/H(g) · TG/H(x) = TG/H(g) · xd

for all g ∈ G.

Again from Lemma 2.7.2(2) we have for x ∈ G2
(gx)d = gdxd[g, x]− d(d−1)

2 = gdxd

for all g ∈ G.

By comparing we can see that ϕG/H(gx) = ϕG/H(g) for all g ∈ G and x ∈ G2.

Thus we can conclude that the correcting function ϕG/H is a function on G/G2[G, G] with

values in Z2.

(ii) Gd ⊂ Z(G) if and only if Im(ϕG/H) ⊂ Z(G).

70

Proof. From Lemma 4.1.3(iii) we have TG/H(g) = gd · ϕG/H(g). From relation (2.8.4) we also
know that Im(TG/H) ⊆ HG/H ⊆ Z(G), hence gd · ϕG/H(g) ∈ Z(G). Now if Gd ⊂ Z(G), then
ϕG/H(g) ∈ Z(G) for all g ∈ G. Hence Im(ϕG/H) ⊂ Z(G).
Conversely, if Im(ϕG/H) ⊂ Z(G), then from gdϕG/H(g) ∈ Z(G) we can conclude that Gd ⊂
Z(G).

(iii) When d is odd (resp. even), ϕG/H is a homomorphism (resp. not a homomorphism).

Proof. Since TG/H is a homomorphism we obtain the identity:

(g1g2)dϕG/H(g1g2) = gd

1gd

2ϕG/H(g1)ϕG/H(g2).

This implies

ϕG/H(g1g2)

ϕG/H(g1)ϕG/H(g2)

(4.1.12)

(4.1.13)

We also have here [G, G]d = 1. When d is odd, then d divides d(d−1)
, hence the right side
of equation (4.1.13) is equal to 1. Thus when d is odd, ϕ is a homomorphism, and exactly
ϕ ≡ 1. This follows from Lemma 4.1.1.
But when d is even d does not divide d(d−1)
equal to 1. This shows that ϕG/H is not a homomorphism when d is even.

, hence the right side of equation (4.1.13) is not

2

2

(iv) If H(cid:48) ⊂ G is another normal subgroup such that H(cid:48) is abelian and G/H(cid:48) is abelian
of order d, then ϕG/H(cid:48) is again a function on G/G2[G, G] with values in Z2 which satisﬁes the
same identity (4.1.13), hence we will have

ϕG/H(cid:48) = ϕG/H · fH,H(cid:48)
for some homomorphism fH,H(cid:48) ∈ Hom(G/G2[G, G], Z2).

4.2

Invariant formula of determinant for Heisenberg

representations

In general, for the Heisenberg setting G need not be two-step nilpotent group. But G =
G/Ker(ρ) is always a two-step nilpotent group, where ρ is a Heisenberg representation of
G. The Lemmas 4.1.1 and 4.1.3 hold for two-step nilpotent groups. Therefore to use them
in our Heisenberg setting, we have to do our computation under modulo Ker(ρ). Our
determinant computation is under modulo Ker(ρ). And we drop modulo Ker(ρ) from
our remaining part of this chapter.

Before going to our next proposition we need this following result.

Proposition 4.2.1. Let G be an abelian group of rk2(G) = n. Then G has 2n − 1 nontrivial
elements of order 2.

71

Proof. We know that (Zn, +) is a cyclic group, where n ∈ N. If n is odd, Zn does not have
2 ∈ Zn is the only
any nontrivial element of order 2. But when n is even, it is clear that n
one nontrivial element of order 2. So this tells us when n is even, Zn has a unique element of
order 2.

Any given abelian group G of rk2(G) = n can be written as

G ∼= Zm1 × Zm2 × ··· × Zms

where m1|m2|···|ms and ms−n+1, ms−n+2,··· , ms are n even, and rest of the mi-s are odd.
Therefore from equation (3.3.3) we conclude that

|G[2]| = |Zm1 × ··· × Zms[2]| =(cid:81)n

i=1 |Zms−n+i[2]| = 2×···×2

n-times = 2n.

Hence we can conclude that when G is abelian with rk2(G) = n, it has 2n − 1 nontrivial
elements of order 2.

Proposition 4.2.2. Let ρ = (Z, χρ) be a Heisenberg representation of G, of dimension d,
and put Xρ(g1, g2) := χρ ◦ [g1, g2]. Then we obtain

(det(ρ))(g) = ε(g) · χρ(gd),

(4.2.1)

where ε is a function on G with the following properties:

1. ε has values in {±1}.
2. ε(gx) = ε(g) for all x ∈ G2 · Z, hence ε is a function on the factor group G/G2 · Z, and

in particular, ε ≡ 1 if [G : Z] = d2 is odd.

3. If d is even, then the function ε need not be a homomorphism but:

ε(g1)ε(g2)
ε(g1g2) = Xρ(g1, g2)

d(d−1)

2 = Xρ(g1, g2) d
2 .

Furthermore,
(a) When rk2(G/Z) (cid:62) 4: ε is a homomorphism, and exactly ε ≡ 1.
(b) When rk2(G/Z) = 2: ε is not a homomorphism and ε is a function on G/G2Z

such that

(det ρ)(g) = ε(g) · χρ(gd) =

χρ(gd)

−χρ(gd)

for g ∈ G2Z
for g /∈ G2Z.

Proof. By the given condition, ρ = (Z, χρ) is a Heisenberg representation of G. Let H be a
maximal isotopic subgroup for Xρ, then we have ρ = IndG
H(χH), where χH is a linear character

72

of H which extends χρ. Then modulo Ker(χρ) = Ker(ρ) ⊂ Z the assumptions of the Lemma
4.1.3 are fulﬁlled, and therefore:

H(g) · χH(TG/H(g))
H(g) · χρ(TG/H(g)) because the values of TG/H are in Z
H(g) · χρ(gd)χρ(ϕG/H(g))

from Lemma 4.1.3

(det ρ)(g) = ∆G
= ∆G
= ∆G
= ε(g) · χρ(gd),

where

H(g) · χρ(ϕG/H(g)).

(4.2.2)
H is the quadratic determinant character of G, hence for every g ∈ G, we have

Since ∆G
H(g) ∈ {±1}. And ϕG/H(g) ∈ Z2, then χρ(ϕG/H(g)) ∈ {±1}. Therefore for every g ∈ G,
∆G

ε(g) := ∆G

ε(g) = ∆G

H(g) · χρ(ϕG/H(g)) ∈ {±1},

which does not depend on H because ∆G

H = ∆G/H

1

, and χρ does not depend on H.

Here Z is the scalar group of the irreducible representation ρ of dimension d, then by

deﬁnition of scalar group, elements z ∈ Z are represented by scalar matrices, i.e.,

ρ(z) = χρ(z) · Id, where Id is the d × d identity matrix.

This implies

(det ρ)(z) = χρ(z)d = χρ(zd).

We also know that Z is the radical of Xρ, therefore

Xρ(z, g) = χρ([z, g]) = 1 for all z ∈ Z and g ∈ G.

Moreover, we can consider det ρ as a linear character of G, therefore

(det ρ)(gz) = (det ρ)(g) · (det ρ)(z) = ε(g)χρ(gd)χρ(zd).

(4.2.3)

On the other hand

(det ρ)(gz) = ε(gz)χρ((gz)d) = ε(gz)χρ(gdzd[g, z]− d(d−1)

2

) = ε(gz)χρ(gd)χρ(zd).

(4.2.4)

On comparing equations (4.2.3) and (4.2.4) we get

ε(gz) = ε(g) for all g ∈ G and z ∈ Z.

Moreover, since ε(g) is a sign, we have

(det ρ)(g2) = (det ρ)(g)2 = ε(g)2χρ(gd)2 = χρ(g2d).

Therefore

(det ρ)(gx2) = (det ρ)(g) · (det ρ)(x2) = ε(g)χρ(gd)χρ(x2d).

(4.2.5)

73

On the other hand

(det ρ)(gx2) = ε(gx2)χρ((gx2)d) = ε(gx2)χρ(gd)χρ(x2d).

(4.2.6)

So we see from equations (4.2.5) and (4.2.6) ε(gx2) = ε(g), hence ε is a function on G/G2Z.
In particular, when [G : Z] = d2 is odd, i.e., |G/H| = d is odd, we have ϕG/H(g) = 1 as
H(g) = 1 because H is normal subgroup of odd index in G. This shows that ε ≡ 1

For checking property (iii), we use equation (4.2.1) and [G, G]d = {1}. Since [G, G]d = {1},

direct product of H and H but nevertheless G = H · H(cid:48). So for any g ∈ G there must exist a
decomposition g = h · h(cid:48), where h ∈ H and h(cid:48) ∈ H(cid:48).
Now we assume rk2(G/Z) (cid:54)= 2, hence rk2(H/Z) = rk2(H(cid:48)/Z) (cid:54)= 1. And since G/H ∼= H/Z
and G/H(cid:48) ∼= H(cid:48)/Z, then rk2(G/H) = rk2(G/H(cid:48)) (cid:54)= 1. Then from Proposition 4.2.1 we can

say both G/H and G/H(cid:48) have at least 3 elements of order 2. Then from Theorem 2.7.1 we
have αG/H = 1 and αG/H(cid:48) = 1. Furthermore from formula (4.1.8) we obtain

TG/H(h) = hd · [h, αG/H] = hd,

and TG/H(h(cid:48)) = h(cid:48)d · [h(cid:48), αG/H(cid:48)] = h(cid:48)d.

So we can write

(det ρ)(g) = (det ρ)(h) · (det ρ)(h(cid:48)),

here g = h · h(cid:48) is a decomposition of g with h ∈ H, h(cid:48) ∈ H(cid:48),

But since ε is a function on G/G2Z, hence ε|G2Z ≡ 1. Therefore when g ∈ G2Z we
have (det ρ)(g) = χρ(gd). So now we are left to show that for g /∈ G2Z, ε(g) = −1, i.e.,
(det ρ)(g) = −χρ(gd). Also, for rk2(G/Z) = 2, G/G2Z is Klein’s 4-group4 and ε is a sign
function on that group. So up to permutation the possibilities are

1. + + ++
2. + + +−
3. + + −−
4. + − −−

The cases (1), (3) can be excluded because we know that ε is not a homomorphism. So we
have to exclude the case (2) and for this it is enough to see that we must have ”−” more than

are exactly three elements of order 2 in G/Z, and this each element (i.e., self-inverse element) corresponds a
quadratic character of G/Z. Hence the group G/G2Z has exactly three quadratic characters. Furthermore,
G/G2Z is a quotient group of the abelian group G/Z, hence G/G2Z is abelian. Therefore G/G2Z is isomorphic
to the Klein’s 4-group.

75

If we restrict ε to a maximal isotropic subgroup H, then from equation (4.2.7) we can
say ε is a homomorphism on H, because Xρ|H×H = 1. We also have from equation (4.1.8)
TG/H(h) = hd · [h, αG/H] = hdϕG/H(h). This implies ϕG/H(h) = [h, αG/H] for all h ∈ H.
Moreover, since ∆G

H|H ≡ 1, then for h ∈ H we obtain:

ε(h) = ∆G

H(h) · χρ(ϕG/H(h)) = χρ([h, αG/H]).

If there exists a maximal isotropic subgroup H of rk2(H/Z) = 1, then from the Proposition
4.2.1 can say that H/Z has a unique element of order 2. We also know G/H ∼= H/Z because
G/H and H/Z are both ﬁnite abelian groups of same order d, hence rk2(H/Z) = rk2(G/H) =
1. Then from the Proposition 4.2.1, G/H has a unique element of order 2, and therefore by
Miller’s theorem we have αG/H (cid:54)= 1. Thus for the case rk2(H/Z) = 1 we have

ε(h) = ∆G

H(h) · χρ([h, αG/H]) = χρ([h, αG/H]) = −1

(4.2.8)

for all nontrivial h ∈ H.

Moreover, if rk2(G/Z) = 2, then from the Lemma 2.7.4 there exists subgroups H, H(cid:48) with

the following properties

1. rk2(H/Z) = rk2(H(cid:48)/Z) = 1
2. G = H · H(cid:48)
3. Z = H ∩ H(cid:48)

Then H/G2Z and H(cid:48)/G2Z are two diﬀerent subgroups of order 2 in Klein’s 4-group. Now
take the nontrivial elements of these subgroups are h and h(cid:48) respectively. Then by using
equation (4.2.8) we have

i.e., the nontrivial elements of H/G2Z and H(cid:48)/G2Z give the two ”−” signs for ε.

ε(h) = ε(h(cid:48)) = −1,

Therefore the only possibility is + − −−, i.e., ε takes 1 on the trivial coset and −1 on the
three other cosets.

This completes the proof.

mension d. Then Gd ⊆ Z and

1. Let ρ = (Z, χρ) ∈ Irr(G) be a Heisenberg representation of odd di-

det(ρ)(g) = χρ(gd),

for all g ∈ G.

In particular, det(ρ) ≡ 1 if and only if χρ is a character of Z/Gd. This is only possible
if [G, G] (cid:54)⊆ Gd and if χρ is a nontrivial character on Gd[G, G]/Gd ⊆ Z/Gd.

2. Let ω be a linear character of G, then ρ ⊗ ω = (Z, χρ⊗ω), where:
det(ρ ⊗ ω) = det(ρ) · ωd,

χρ⊗ω = χρ · ωZ,

76

where ωZ = ω|Z. Therefore it is possible to ﬁnd ω such that det(ρ⊗ ω) ≡ 1, equivalently
χρ = ω−1

Z on Gd, if and only if χρ is trivial on Gd ∩ [G, G].

Proof. (1). We consider H such that Z ⊂ H ⊂ G and H is maximal isotropic with respect
to

X(g1, g2) := χρ ◦ [g1, g2].

By deﬁnition, Z/[G, G] is radical of X, hence Ker(ρ) = Ker(χρ) ⊂ Z, and factorizing by
Ker(χρ) we obtain a group G = G/Ker(χρ) which satisﬁes the assumptions of the Lemma
4.1.1. Moreover, ρ = IndG

HχH for any extension χH of χρ, hence

det(ρ) = ∆G

H · (χH ◦ TG/H) = χH ◦ TG/H,

because H ⊂ G is a normal subgroup of odd index d. Applying the Lemma 4.1.1 we obtain
for all g ∈ G:

det(g) = χH ◦ TG/H(g) = χH(gd) = χρ(gd),

(4.2.9)
here we have used gd = TG/H(g) ∈ Im(TG/H) ⊆ H G/H ⊆ Z because our computation is
modulo Ker(χρ).

If det(ρ) ≡ 1, then from equation (4.2.9), we have χρ(gd) = 1, i.e., gd ∈ Ker(χρ) for all

g ∈ G. This shows Gd ⊆ Ker(χρ). Again if Gd ⊆ Ker(χρ), then it is easy to see det ρ ≡ 1.

Now if χρ : Z/Gd → C× is a character, then we see that Gd ⊆ Ker(χρ), i.e., gd ∈ Ker(χρ).

since gd ∈ Z,

Thus from equation (4.2.9), we conclude det(ρ) ≡ 1.

If [G, G] ⊆ Gd this would imply [G, G] ⊂ Ker(χρ) which means Z = G, hence ρ is of
dimension 1. Also, if χρ is trivial on Gd[G, G]/Gd, i.e., [G, G] ⊆ Ker(ρ), hence dimension
of ρ is 1. Therefore when det ρ ≡ 1 and [G, G]
(cid:54)⊆ Gd and χρ is a nontrivial character
on Gd[G, G]/Gd ⊆ Z/Gd, then we can extend χρ to Z/Gd because χρ is G-invariant and
Gd[G, G]/Gd is a normal subgroup of Z/Gd.
(2). Let ω be a linear character of G and ωZ = ω|Z. Then we can write (cf.
Remark (3))

[27], p. 57,

ω ⊗ IndG

Z χρ = IndG

Z (χρ ⊗ ωZ) = IndG

Z χρ⊗ω = d · ρ ⊗ ω,

where χρ⊗ω=χρ·ωZ and d = dim(ρ). Moreover, it is easy to see χρ ⊗ ωZ is a G-invariant.
Therefore we can write ρ ⊗ ω = (Z, χρ⊗ω). Now we are left to compute determinant of ρ ⊗ ω,
which follows from the properties of determinant function (cf. [17], p. 955, Lemma 30.1.3).
Since dim(ρ) = d and ω is linear, we have

det(ρ ⊗ ω) = det(ρ)ω(1) · det(ω)ρ(1) = det(ρ) · ωd.

Here d is odd and we know gd ∈ Z, then for every g ∈ G, we have

det(ρ ⊗ ω)(g) = χρ(gd) · ωd(g) = χρ · ωZ(gd).

(4.2.10)

Now if det(ρ ⊗ ω) ≡ 1, then we have χρ = ω−1
linear character ω such that det(ρ ⊗ ω) ≡ 1.

Z on Gd. This implies, it is possible to ﬁnd a

χρ is trivial on Gd ∩ [G, G].

Z on Gd. Since Gd ∩ [G, G] ⊆ Gd, χρ · ωZ(g) = 1 for g ∈ Gd ∩ [G, G]. Then
Conversely, if χρ is trivial on Gd ∩ [G, G], then we are left to show that we can ﬁnd an ω

such that Gd ⊆ Ker(χρ · ωZ).

Put Z1 = Gd · [G, G], and Z0 = Gd ∩ [G, G]. Then we have Z ⊃ Z1 ⊃ Z0, and Z1/Z0 =
Gd/Z0 × [G, G]/Z0 is a direct product. Now assume that χρ is a character of Z/Z0. Then the
restriction χZ1 = χ1 · χ2 comes as the product of two characters of Z1, where χ1 is trivial on
[G, G] and χ2 is trivial on Gd. But then we can ﬁnd ω of G/[G, G] such that ωZ1 = χ1, hence
ω−1χρ restricted to Z1 is equal χ2. In particular, ω−1χρ is trivial on Gd and therefore ω−1 ⊗ ρ
has det(ω−1 ⊗ ρ) ≡ 1.

Corollary 4.2.4. If ρ = (Z, χρ) is a Heisenberg representation (of dimension > 1) for a
nonabelian group of order p3, (p (cid:54)= 2, ) then Z = [G, G] is cyclic group of order p, and Gp = Z
or Gp = {1} depending on the isomorphism type of G. So we have det(ρ) (cid:54)≡ 1 and det(ρ) ≡ 1
depending on the isomorphism type of G.
Proof. In this particular case for Heisenberg setting we have |Z| = p and G/Z is abelian.
This implies [G, G] ⊆ Z. Here G is nonabelian and p is prime, therefore [G, G] = Z is a cyclic
group of order p. Let Ψ : G → G be a p-power map, i.e., g (cid:55)→ gp. It can be proved that this
map Ψ is a surjective group homomorphism (by using Lemma 2.7.2) and the image is in Z
(because from Lemma 4.1.1 and relation (2.8.4) we have gp = TG/H(g) ∈ Z), hence from the
ﬁrst isomorphism theorem we have

G/Ker(Ψ) ∼= Im(Ψ) = Gp.

Thus we can write

So we have the possibility

p3 = |Ker(Ψ)| · |Gp|.

|Ker(Ψ)| = p3 or p2 corresponding to Gp = 1 or Gp = Z.

Both the cases are possible depending on the isomorphism type of G. So we can conclude
that det(ρ) (cid:54)≡ 1 and det(ρ) ≡ 1 depending on the isomorphism type of G.

Remark 4.2.5. We know that there are two non-abelian group of order p3, up to isomorphism
(for details see [34]). Now put



1 a b

0 1 c
0 0 1


 : a, b, c ∈ Z/pZ

Gp =

We observe that this Gp is a non-abelian group under matrix multiplication with order p3.
p = {I3}, the identity in Gp. Now if ρ is a Heisenberg representation of
We also see that Gp
group Gp, then we will have det(ρ) ≡ 1.

78

And when G is extraspecial group of order p3, where p (cid:54)= 2 with Gp = Z, we will have
Ker(Ψ) ∼= Cp × Cp, where Cp is the cyclic group of order p. Therefore det(ρ)(g) = χZ(gp).
This shows that det(ρ) (cid:54)≡ 1.

From Corollary 4.2.4, we observe that for non-abelian group of order p3, where p is prime,
the determinant of Heisenberg representation of G gives the information about the isomor-
phism type of G.

Remark 4.2.6. When the dimension d of ρ is odd, the 2-rank of G/Z is 0, and we notice that
in this case ε ≡ 1. Therefore we could rephrase our above Proposition 4.2.2 as follows:

1. If the 2-rank of G/Z is diﬀerent from 2, we have

(det ρ)(g) = χρ(gd).

2. If the 2-rank of G/Z is equal to 2, then G/G2Z is Klein’s 4-group, and we have a sign

function ε on G/G2Z such that

(det ρ)(g) = ε(g) · χρ(gd).

Moreover, the function ε is not a homomorphism and it takes 1 on the trivial coset and
−1 on the three other cosets. Thus when rm2(G/Z) = 2, we can write

χρ(gd)

−χρ(gd)

(det ρ)(g) =

for g ∈ G2Z
for g /∈ G2Z.

Example 4.2.7. Let G be a dihedral group of order 8 and we write

G = {e, b, a, a2, a3, ab, a2b, a3b | a4 = b2 = e, bab−1 = a−1}.

It is easy to see that [G, G] = {e, a2} = Z = Z(G) = G2. Thus G2Z = {e, a2}. We also have

G/G2Z ∼= {G2Z, aG2Z, abG2Z, bG2Z}, and the subgroups of order 4 are:

H1 = {e, b, a2, a2b}, H2 = {e, ab, a2, a3b} and H3 = {e, a, a2, a3}.

And the factor groups are: G/H1 = {H1, aH1}, G/H2 = {H2, aH2} and G/H3 = {H3, bH3}.

Let ρ be a Heisenberg representation of G. The dimension of ρ is 2. In this case the 2-rank
of G/Z is 2, then G/Z = G/G2Z is Klein’s 4-group.

For this group we can see that ε is a function on G/Z ∼= {Z, aZ, bZ, abZ}. When g = a ∈ G

, we have H1 for which g = a ∈ H1, then we have

ε(a) = ∆G

H1(a) · χρ([a, αG/H1]) = χρ([a, αG/H1]) = −1.

Similarly, we can see when g ∈ bZ and g ∈ abZ we have ε(g) = −1. Thus we can conclude
for dihedral group of order 8, that

For our next remark we need the following lemma.

Lemma 4.2.8. Let ρ = (Z, χρ) be a Heisenberg representation of G and put Xρ(g1, g2) :=
χρ([g1, g2]). Then for every element g ∈ G, there exists a maximal isotropic subgroup H for
Xρ such that g ∈ H.

Proof. Let g be a nontrivial element in G. Now we take a cyclic subgroup H0 generated by
g, i.e., H0 =< g >. Then Xρ(g, g) = 1 implies H0 ⊆ H⊥
0 . If H0 is not maximal isotropic,
then the inclusion is proper and H0 together with some h ∈ H⊥
(cid:114) H0 generates some larger
isotropic subgroup H1 ⊃ H0. Again we have H1 ⊆ H⊥
1 , and if H1 is not maximal then
the inclusion is proper, then again we proceed same method and will have another isotopic
subgroup and we continue this process step by step come to maximal isotropic subgroup H.
Therefore for every element g ∈ G, we would have a maximal subgroup H such that

0

g ∈ H.

Remark 4.2.9. From equation (4.2.7) we can say that ε is a homomorphism when it restricts
to H because Xρ|H×H = 1. Also from Lemma 4.2.8, if g ∈ G, then there always exists a
maximal isotropic subgroup H such that g = h ∈ H. Since H is normal, then ∆G
is
trivial on H and we see in particular for h ∈ H

H = ∆G/H

1

(detρ)(h) = χH(h)dχH(ϕG/H(h)) = χρ(hd) · χρ([h, αG/H]),

(4.2.11)

since [h, αG/H] ∈ Z.

The formula (4.2.11) reformulates as:

(det ρ)(h) = χρ(hd) · χρ([h, αG/H]) = χρ(hd) · Xρ(h, αG/H),

(4.2.12)
if g = h sits in some maximal isotropic H, and αG/H ∈ G/H is as above (the product over all
elements from G/H). Of course some g ∈ G can sit in several diﬀerent maximal isotropic H.
So it is a little mysterious that the result (=left side of the formula (4.2.12)) is independent
from that H. Moreover, if H is maximal isotropic then

G/H ∼=

(cid:91)H/Z,

g (cid:55)→ {h (cid:55)→ X(h, g)}.

Now αG/H (cid:54)= 1 means that G/H has precisely one element of order 2, equivalently H/Z has
precisely one character of order 2, equivalently H/H 2Z is of order 2. Therefore equation
(4.2.12) can be reformulated as to say that in the critical case:

(det ρ)(h) = χρ(hd) or = −χρ(hd) depending on h ∈ H 2Z or h (cid:54)∈ H 2Z.

Chapter 5

The local constants for Heisenberg
representations

In this chapter we give an invariant formula of local constant for a Heisenberg representation
ρ of the absolute Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp (cf. Theorem 5.2.4).
But for giving more explicit invariant formula for W (ρ), we need to know the full information
about the dimension of a Heisenberg representation.
In Theorem 5.1.29, we compute the
dimension of a Heisenberg representation ρ of GF .

In Section 5.1, we deﬁne U-isotopic Heisenberg representations and study their properties
(e.g., dimensions, Artin conductors, Swan conductors). In Theorem 5.2.5, we give an invariant
formula of local constant of a minimal conductor Heisenberg representation ρ of dimension
prime to p. And when ρ is not minimal conductor but dimension is prime to p, we have
Theorem 5.2.8.

In Section 5.3, we also discuss Tate’s root-of-unity criterion, and by applying this Tate’s
criterion we give the information when W (ρ) will be a root of unity or not. This chapter is
based on the article [44].

5.1 Arithmetic description of Heisenberg representa-

tions

In Section 2.6 of Chapter 2, we became familiar with the notion of Heisenberg representations
of a (pro-)ﬁnite group. These Heisenberg representations have arithmetic structure due to
E.-W. Zink (cf. [11], [13], [14]). For this chapter we need to describe the arithmetic structure
of Heisenberg representations.

Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld, and F be an algebraic closure of F . Denote GF = Gal(F/F) the
absolute Galois group for F /F . We know that (cf. [19], p. 197) each representation ρ : GF →
GL(n, C) corresponds to a projective representation ρ : GF → GL(n, C) → P GL(n, C).
On the other hand, each projective representation ρ : GF → P GL(n, C) can be lifted to a
representation ρ : GF → GL(n, C). Let AF = Gab
F be the factor commutator group of GF .

81

Deﬁne

F F × := lim←−(F ×/N ∧ F ×/N )

where N runs over all open subgroups of ﬁnite index in F ×. Denote by Alt(F×) as the set of
all alternating characters X : F × × F × → C× such that [F × : Rad(X)] < ∞. Then the local
reciprocity map gives an isomorphism between AF and the proﬁnite completion of F ×, and
induces a natural bijection

PI(AF)

∼−→ Alt(F×),

(5.1.1)

where PI(AF) is the set of isomorphism classes of projective irreducible representations of AF .
By using class ﬁeld theory from the commutator map (2.6.3) (cf. p. 125 of [14]) we obtain

c : F F × ∼= [GF , GF ]/[[GF , GF ], GF ].

(5.1.2)
Let K/F be an abelian extension corresponding to the norm subgroup N ⊂ F × and if
WK/F denotes the relative Weil group, the commutator map for WK/F induces an isomorphism
(cf. p. 128 of [14]):

c : F ×/N ∧ F ×/N → K×

F /IF K×,

(5.1.3)

where

F := {x ∈ K×| NK/F (x) = 1}, i.e., the norm-1-subgroup of K×,
K×

IF K× := {x1−σ| x ∈ K×, σ ∈ Gal(K/F)} < K×

F , the augmentation with respect to K/F .

Taking the projective limit over all abelian extensions K/F the isomorphisms (5.1.3) induce:

c : F F × ∼= lim←− K×

F /IF K×,

(5.1.4)

where the limit on the right side refers to norm maps. This gives an arithmetic description
of Heisenberg representations of the group GF .

Theorem 5.1.1 (Zink, [11], p. 301, Corollary 1.2). The set of Heisenberg representations ρ
of GF is in bijective correspondence with the set of all pairs (Xρ, χρ) such that:

1. Xρ is a character of F F ×,
2. χρ is a character of K×/IF K×, where the abelian extension K/F corresponds to the

radical N ⊂ F × of Xρ, and

3. via (5.1.3) the alternating character Xρ corresponds to the restriction of χρ to K×
F .

Given a pair (X, χ), we can construct the Heisenberg representation ρ by induction from

GK := Gal(F/K) to GF :

(5.1.5)

82

where N and K are as in (2) of the above Theorem 5.1.1 and where the induction of χ (to
be considered as a character of GK by class ﬁeld theory) produces a multiple of ρ. From
[F × : N ] = [K : F ] we obtain the dimension formula:

dim(ρ) =(cid:112)[F× : N],

(5.1.6)

where N is the radical of X.

Let K/E be an extension of E, and χK : K× → C× be a character of K×.

following lemma, we give the conditions of the existence of characters χE ∈ (cid:99)E× such that

χE ◦ NK/E = χK, and the solutions set of this χE.
Lemma 5.1.2. Let K/E be a ﬁnite extension of a ﬁeld E, and χK : K× → C×.
(i) The existence of characters χE : E× → C× such that χE ◦ NK/E = χK is equivalent to

In the

E ⊂ Ker(χK).
K×

(ii) In case (i) is fulﬁlled, we have a well deﬁned character

χK/E := χK ◦ N−1

K/E : NK/E → C×,

(5.1.7)
on the subgroup of norms NK/E := NK/E(K×) ⊂ E×, and the solutions χE such that
χE ◦ NK/E = χK are precisely the extensions of χK/E from NK/E to a character of E×.

Proof. (i) Suppose that an equation χK = χE ◦ NK/E holds. Let x ∈ K×
Then

E , hence NK/E(x) = 1.

E

(cid:92)
K×/K×

∼= NK/E ⊂ E×, hence

So x ∈ Ker(χK), and hence K×
Conversely assume that K×

χK(x) = χE ◦ NK/E(x) = χE(1) = 1.
E ⊂ Ker(χK).
E ⊂ Ker(χK). Then χK is actually a character of K×/K×
E .
∼= (cid:92)NK/E. Now suppose that χK
Again we have K×/K×
corresponds to the character χK/E of NK/E. Hence we can write χK ◦ N−1
K/F = χK/E. Thus the
character χK/E : NK/E → C× is well deﬁned. Since E× is an abelian group and NK/E ⊂ E×
is a subgroup of ﬁnite index (by class ﬁeld theory) [K : E], we can extend χK/E to E×, and
χK is of the form χK = χE ◦ NK/E with χE|NK/E = χK/E.
(ii) If condition (i) is satisﬁed, then this part is obvious. If χE is a solution of χK = χE◦NK/E,
K/E : NK/E → C×, then certainly χE is an extension of the character
with χK/E := χK ◦ N−1
χK/E.

Conversely, if χE extends χK/E, then it is a solution of χK = χE ◦ NK/E with χK ◦ N−1

E

K/E =

χK/E : NK/E → C×.

Remark 5.1.3. Now take Heisenberg representation ρ = ρ(X, χK) of GF . Let E/F be any
extension corresponding to a maximal isotropic for X.
In this Heisenberg setting, from
Theorem 5.1.1(2), we know χK is a character of K×/IF K×, and from the ﬁrst commutative
F /IFNK/E. Thus in the Heisenberg
diagram on p. 302 of [11] we have NK/E : K×
setting, we have more information than Lemma 5.1.2(i), that χK is a character of

F /IF K× → E×

K×/K×

E IF K× NK/E−−−→ NK/E/IFNK/E ⊂ E×/IFNK/E,

(5.1.8)

83

and therefore χK/F is actually a character of NK/E/IFNK/E, or in other words,
it is a
Gal(E/F)-invariant character of the Gal(E/F)-module NK/E ⊂ E×. And if χE is one of
the solution of Lemma 5.1.2(ii), then the complete solutions is the set {χσ
E | σ ∈ Gal(E/F)}.
We know that W (χE, ψ ◦ TrK/E) has the same value for all solutions χE of χE ◦

NK/E = χK, which means for all χE which extend the character χK/E.

Moreover, from the above Lemma 5.1.2, we also can see that χE|NK/E = χK ◦ N−1
K/E.
Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of GF . Let E/F be any extension
corresponding to a maximal isotropic for X. Then by using the above Lemma 5.1.2, we have
the following lemma.

Lemma 5.1.4. Let ρ = ρ(Z, χρ) = ρ(Gal(L/K), χK) be a Heisenberg representation of a
ﬁnite local Galois group G = Gal(L/F), where F is a non-archimedean local ﬁeld. Let H =
Gal(L/E) be a maximal isotropic for ρ. Then we obtain

ρ = IndE/F(χσ
E)

for all σ ∈ Gal(E/F),

(5.1.9)

where χE : E×/IFNK/E → C× with χK = χE ◦ NK/E.
Moreover, for a ﬁxed base ﬁeld E of a maximal isotropic for ρ, this construction of ρ is
independent of the choice of this character χE.

Proof. From the group theoretical construction of Heisenberg representation (cf. see Section
2.6), we can write

for all g ∈ G/H,

ρ = IndG

H(χg

H),

(5.1.10)
where χH : H → C× is an extension of χρ. From Remark 2.6.2 we know that all extensions of
character χρ are conjugate with respect to G/H, and they are diﬀerent. If we ﬁx H, then ρ
is independent of the choice of character χH. For every extension of χρ we will have same ρ.
The assertion of the lemma is the arithmetic expression of this group theoretical facts, and
which we will prove in the following.

By the given conditions, L/F is a ﬁnite Galois extension of the local ﬁeld F and G =
Gal(L/F), and H = Gal(L/E), Z = Gal(L/K) and {1} = Gal(L/L). Then by class ﬁeld
theory, equation (5.1.3), and the condition X := χK ◦ [−,−], χρ identiﬁes with a character

χK : K×/IF K× → C×.

Moreover, for the Heisenberg representations we also have the following commutative diagram

K×

(cid:120)c

where NE/F ∧NE/F (a∧b) = NE/F (a)∧NE/F (b) for all a, b ∈ E×, and the vertical isomorphisms
in upward direction are given as the commutator maps (cf. equation (5.1.3)) in the Weil
groups WK/E/IEK× and WK/F /IF K× respectively. Under the right vertical χK corresponds

(5.1.11)

84

(cf. Theorem 5.1.1(3)) to the alternating character X which is trivial on NE/F ∧NE/F , because
H corresponding to E× is isotropic. The commutative diagram now shows that χK must be
trivial on the image of the upper horizontal, i.e., χK is trivial on the subgroups K×
E for all
maximal isotropic E. Hence χK is actually a character of K×/K×
E .

Then from Lemma 5.1.2 we can say that there exists a character χE : E×/IFNK/E → C×
such that χK = χE ◦ NK/E. And this χE is determined by the character χH. Since χE is
trivial on IFNK/E, for σ ∈ G/H = Gal(E/F ) we have χσ
E ◦ NK/E = χE ◦ NK/E = χK because
χσ−1

Therefore instead of ρ = IndG

Remark 5.1.5. Moreover, we have the exact sequence
K×/IF K× NK/E−−−→ E×/IFNK/E

NE/F−−−→ F ×/NK/F ,

(5.1.12)

which is only exact in the middle term. For the dual groups this gives

For our (arithmetic) determinant computation of Heisenberg representation ρ of GF , we

need the following lemma regarding transfer map.

Lemma 5.1.6. Let ρ = ρ(Z, χρ) be a Heisenberg representation of a group G and assume
that H/Z ⊂ G/Z is a maximal isotropic for ρ. Then transfer map T(G/Z)/(H/Z) ≡ 1 is the
trivial map.

Proof. In general, if H is a central subgroup1 of ﬁnite index n = [G : H] of a group G, then by
Theorem 5.6 on p. 154 of [21] we have TG/H(g) = gn. If G is abelian, then center Z(G) = G.
Hence every subgroup of G is central subgroup. Now if we take G as an abelian group and
H is a subgroup of ﬁnite index, then we can write TG/H(g) = g[G:H].

Now we come to the Heisenberg setting. We know that G/Z is abelian, hence H/Z ⊂
G/Z is a central subgroup. Then we have T(G/Z)/(H/Z)(g) = g[G/Z:H/Z] = gd, where d is the
dimension of ρ. For the Heisenberg setting, we also know (cf. Lemma 4.1.3) that Gd ⊆ Z,
hence gd ∈ Z. This implies

T(G/Z)/(H/Z)(g) = gd = 1,

the identity in H/Z,

for all g ∈ G, hence T(G/Z)/(H/Z) ≡ 1 is a trivial map.

H ⊆ Z(G).

85

By using the above Lemma 5.1.2 and Lemma 5.1.6, in the following, we give the arithmetic

description of Proposition 4.2.2.

Proposition 5.1.7. Let ρ = ρ(Z, χρ) = ρ(GK, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the
absolute Galois group GF . Let E be a base ﬁeld of a maximal isotropic for ρ. Then F × ⊆
NK/E, and

det(ρ)(x) = ∆E/F (x) · χK ◦ N−1

K/E(x)

for all x ∈ F ×,

where, for all x ∈ F ×,

∆E/F (x) =

ωE(cid:48)/F (x) when rk2(Gal(E/F)) = 1,

(5.1.15)

(5.1.16)

(5.1.17)

where E(cid:48)/F is a uniquely determined quadratic subextension in E/F , and ωE(cid:48)/F is the char-
acter of F × which corresponds to E(cid:48)/F by class ﬁeld theory.
Proof. From the given condition, we can write G/Z = Gal(K/F) ⊃ H/Z = Gal(K/E). Here
both G/Z and H/Z are abelian, then from class ﬁeld theory we have the following commuta-
tive diagram

F ×/NK/F

(cid:121)θK/E

Here θK/F , θK/F are the isomorphism (Artin reciprocity) maps and T(G/Z)/(H/Z) is transfer
map. From Lemma 5.1.6, we have T(G/Z)/(H/Z) ≡ 1. Therefore from the above diagram
(5.1.17) we can say F × ⊆ NK/E, i.e., all elements 2 from the base ﬁeld F are norms with
respect to the extension K/E.

Now identify χρ = χK : K×/IF K× → C×. Then the map

K/E(x)
is well-deﬁned character of F × because χK is trivial on K×
E .

x ∈ F × (cid:55)→ χK ◦ N−1

Now by Gallagher’s Theorem 2.8.2 (arithmetic side) (cf. equation (3.2.4)) we can write

for all x ∈ F ×,

det(ρ)(x) = ∆E/F (x) · χE(x) = ∆E/F (x) · χK(N−1

K/E(x)),

(5.1.18)

since F × ⊆ NK/E, and χE|NK/E = χK ◦ N−1
K/E.

Furthermore, since E/F is an abelian extension, Gal(E/F) ∼=

Theorem 2.7.1, we can write (cf. equation (3.3.7))

(cid:92)Gal(E/F), and from Miller’s

1

∆E/F =

when rk2(Gal(E/F)) (cid:54)= 1
ωE(cid:48)/F (x) when rk2(Gal(E/F)) = 1,

2This condition F × ⊆ NK/E implies that for every x ∈ F × must have a preimage under the NK/E, but

the preimage is not unique.

where E(cid:48)/F is a uniquely determined quadratic subextension in E/F , and ωE(cid:48)/F is the char-
acter of F × which corresponds to E(cid:48)/F by class ﬁeld theory.

5.1.1 Heisenberg representations of GF of dimensions prime to p
Let F/Qp be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld, and GF be the absolute Galois group of F . In
this subsection we construct all Heisenberg representations of GF of dimensions prime to p.
Studying the construction of this type (i.e., dimension prime to p) Heisenberg representations
are important for our next section.
Deﬁnition 5.1.8 (U-isotropic). Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld. Let X : F F × →
C× be an alternating character with the property

X(ε1, ε2) = 1,

for all ε1, ε2 ∈ UF .

In other words, X is a character of F F ×/UF ∧ UF . Then X is said to be the U-isotropic.
These X are easy to classify:

Lemma 5.1.9. Fix a uniformizer πF and write U := UF . Then we obtain an isomorphism

(cid:98)U ∼=

(cid:92)F F ×/U ∧ U ,

η (cid:55)→ Xη,

ηX ← X

between characters of U and U -isotropic alternating characters as follows:

F ε2) := η(ε1)b · η(ε2)−a,
where a, b ∈ Z, ε, ε1, ε2 ∈ U , and η : U → C×. Then

F ε1, πb

Xη(πa

ηX(ε) := X(ε, πF ),

(5.1.19)

Rad(Xη) =< π#η

F > ×Ker(η) =< (πFε)#η > ×Ker(η),

does not depend on the choice of πF , where #η is the order of the character η, hence

F ×/Rad(Xη) ∼=< πF > / < π#η

F > ×U/Ker(η) ∼= Z#η × Z#η.

Proof. To prove (cid:98)U ∼=

Therefore all Heisenberg representations of type ρ = ρ(Xη, χ) have dimension dim(ρ) = #η.
(cid:92)F F ×/U ∧ U , we have to show that ηXη = η and XηX = Xη, and that

the inverse map X (cid:55)→ ηX does not depend on the choice of πF .

From the above deﬁnition of ηX, we can write:

ηXη (ε) = Xη(, πF ) = η(ε)1 · η(1)0 = η(ε),

for all ε ∈ U , hence ηXη = η.

Similarly, from the above deﬁnition of X, we have:

XηX (πa

F ε1, πb

F ε2) = ηX(ε1)b · ηX(ε2)−a = X(ε1, πF )b · X(ε2, πF )−a
F , ε2)

= X(ε1, πF )b · X(πF , ε2)a = X(ε1, πb
= X(πa

F ) · X(πa

F ε1, πb

F ε2).

87

This shows that XηX = X.

Now we choose a uniformizer πF ε, where ε ∈ U , instead of choosing πF . Then we can

write

Xη((πF ε)aε1, (πF ε)bε2) = Xη(πa

F (εaε1), πb

F (εbε2))

= η(εaε1)b · η(εbε2)−a
= η(ε1)b · η(ε2)−a · η(εab−ab)
= η(ε1)b · η(ε2)−a = X(πa

F ε1, πb

F ε2).

This shows that Xη does not depend on the choice of the uniformizer πF . Similarly since
ηX(ε) := X(ε, πF ), it is clear that ηX is also does not depend on the choice of the uniformizer
πF .

By the deﬁnition of the radical of Xη, we have:

Rad(Xη) = {πa

Fε ∈ F× | Xη(πa

Fε, πb

Fε(cid:48)) = η(ε)b · η(ε(cid:48))−a = 1},

for all b ∈ Z, and ε(cid:48) ∈ U .

Now if we ﬁx a uniformizer πF ε(cid:48)(cid:48), where ε(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ U instead of πF , we can write:

Rad(Xη) = {(πFε(cid:48)(cid:48))aε ∈ F× | Xη((πFε(cid:48)(cid:48))aε, (πFε(cid:48)(cid:48))bε(cid:48)) = η(ε(cid:48)(cid:48)aε)b·η(ε(cid:48)(cid:48)bε(cid:48))−a = η(ε)b·η(ε(cid:48))−a = 1},

This gives Rad(Xη) =< π#η

F > ×Ker(η) =< (πFε)#η > ×Ker(η), hence
F > ×U/Ker(η) ∼= Z#η × Z#η.

F ×/Rad(Xη) ∼=< πF > / < π#η

Then all Heisenberg representations of type ρ = ρ(Xη, χ) have dimension

(cid:113)

dim(ρ) =

[F× : Rad(Xη)] = #η.

hence we have (cid:99)UF

∼=

Remark 5.1.10. From Proposition 5.2(i) on p. 50 of [13], we know that F F ×/UF ∧ UF

(cid:92)F F ×/UF ∧ UF . From the above Lemma 5.1.9 we have:

∼= UF ,

Rad(Xη) =< π#η

F > ×Ker(η).

Therefore we can conclude that a U-isotropic character X = Xη has U i
radical if and only if η is a character of UF /U i

F contained in its

From the above Lemma 5.1.9 we know that the dimension of a U-isotropic Heisenberg

representation ρ = ρ(Xη, χ) of GF is dim(ρ) = #η, and F ×/Rad(Xη) ∼= Z#η × Z#η, a direct
product of two cyclic (bicyclic) groups of the same order #η. In general, if A = Zm × Zm
is a bicyclic group of order m2, then by the following lemma we can compute total number
of elements of order m in A, and number of cyclic complementary subgroup of a ﬁxed cyclic
subgroup of order m.

88

Lemma 5.1.11. Let A ∼= Zm × Zm be a bicyclic abelian group of order m2. Then:

1. Then number ψ(m) of cyclic subgroups B ⊂ A of order m is a multiplicative arithmetic

function (i.e., ψ(mn) = ψ(m)ψ(n) if gcd(m, n) = 1).

2. Explicitly we have

Here p is a prime divisor of m and ϕ(n) is the Euler’s totient function of n.

3. Let B ⊂ A be cyclic of order m. Then B has always a complementary subgroup B(cid:48) ⊂ A
such that A = B × B(cid:48), and B(cid:48) is again cyclic of order m. And for B ﬁxed, the number
of all diﬀerent complementary subgroups B(cid:48) is = m.

Proof. To prove these assertions we need to recall the fact: If G is a ﬁnite cyclic group of

order m, then number of generators of G is ϕ(m) = m(cid:81)
(1). By the given condition A ∼= Zm × Zm and ψ(m) is the number of cyclic subgroup of A
not additive. Now take m (cid:62) 2, and the prime factorization of m is: m =(cid:81)k
of order m. Then it is clear that ψ is an arithmetic function with ψ(1) = 1 (cid:54)= 0, hence ψ is
i . To prove
this, ﬁrst we should start with m = pn, hence A ∼= Zpn × Zpn. Then number of subgroup of
A of order pn is:

Now take m = pnqr, where p, q are both prime with gcd(p, q) = 1. We also know that

(3). Let B ⊂ A be a cyclic subgroup of order m. Since A is abelian and bicyclic of order
m2, B has always a complementary subgroup B(cid:48) ⊂ A such that A = B × B(cid:48), and B(cid:48) is again
cyclic (because A is cyclic, hence A/B and |A/B| = m) of order m.

To prove the last part of (3), we start with m = pn. Here B is a cyclic subgroup of A
of order pn, hence B =< (a, e) >, where #a = pn, and e is the identity of B(cid:48). Since B has
complementary cyclic subgroup, namely B(cid:48), of order pn. we can choose B(cid:48) =< (b, c) >, where
B ∩ B(cid:48) = (e, e). This gives that c is a generator of B(cid:48), and b could be any element in Zpn.
Thus total number ψB(cid:48)(pn) of all diﬀerent complementary subgroups B(cid:48) is:

ψB(cid:48)(pn) =

pnϕ(pn)
ϕ(pn)

= pn = m.

Now if we take m = pnqr, where q is a diﬀerent prime from p. Then by same method we can
see that ψB(cid:48)(pnqr) = ψB(cid:48)(pn) · ψB(cid:48)(qr) = pnqr = m. Thus for arbitrary m we can conclude
that ψB(cid:48)(m) = m.

In the following lemma, we give an equivalent condition for U-isotropic Heisenberg repre-

sentation.

Lemma 5.1.12. Let GF be the absolute Galois group of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . For
a Heisenberg representation ρ = ρ(Z, χρ) = ρ(X, χK) the following are equivalent:

1. The alternating character X is U-isotropic.

2. Let E/F be the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in K/F . Then Gal(K/E) is maximal

isotropic for X.

3. ρ = IndE/F(χE) can be induced from a character χE of E× (where E is as in (2)).

i.e., X ∈ (cid:92)F F ×/U ∧ U . We also know that (cid:98)U ∼=
Proof. This proof follows from the above Lemma 5.1.9.
First, assume that X is U-isotropic,
(cid:92)F F ×/U ∧ U . Then X corresponds a character of U , namely X (cid:55)→ ηX. Then from Lemma
5.1.9 we have F ×/Rad(X) ∼= Z#ηX × Z#ηX, i.e., product of two cyclic groups of same order.

Since K/F is the abelian bicyclic extension which corresponds to Rad(X), we can write:

NK/F = Rad(X),

Gal(K/F) ∼= F×/Rad(X).

Let E/F be the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in K/F . Then [E : F ] = #ηK because
the order of maximal cyclic subgroup of Gal(K/F) is #ηX. Then fE/F = #ηX, hence fK/F =
eK/F = #ηX because fK/F · eK/F = [K : F ] = #η2

X and Gal(K/F) is not cyclic group.

Now we have to prove that the extension E/F corresponds to a maximal isotropic for X.
Let H/Z be a maximal isotropic for X, hence [GF /Z : H/Z] = #ηX, hence H/Z = Gal(K/E),
i.e., the maximal unramiﬁed subextension E/F in K/F corresponds to a maximal isotropic
subgroup, hence

90

ρ(X, χK) = IndE/F(χE), for χE ◦ NK/E = χK.

Finally, since E/F is unramiﬁed and the extension E corresponds a maximal isotropic sub-
group for X, we have UF ⊂ NE/F , hence UF ⊂ NK/F and X|U×U = 1 because UF ⊂ F × ⊂
NK/E. This shows that X is U-isotropic.

Corollary 5.1.13. The U-isotropic Heisenberg representation ρ = ρ(Xη, χ) can never be wild
because it is induced from an unramiﬁed extension E/F , but the dimension dim(ρ(Xη, χ)) =
#η can be a power of p.
The representations ρ of dimension prime to p are precisely given as ρ = ρ(Xη, χ) for char-
acters η of U/U 1.
Proof. This is clear from the above lemma 5.1.9 and the fact: |U/U 1| = qF − 1 is prime to

p. We know that the dimension dim(ρ) =(cid:112)[K : F] =(cid:112)[F× : Rad(X)]. If this is prime to p

then K/F is tame and U 1

F ⊆ Rad(X). But U/U 1 is cyclic, hence X is then U -isotopic.

Lemma 5.1.14. Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois group
GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp. Then following are equivalent:

1. dim(ρ) is prime to p.
2. dim(ρ) is a divisor of qF − 1.

3. The alternating character X is U -isotropic and X = Xη for a character η of UF /U 1
F ,

i.e., a(η) = 1.

4. The abelian extension K/F which corresponds to Rad(X) is tamely ramiﬁed.

Proof. (1) implies (2): From Corollary 5.1.13 we know that all Heisenberg representations
of dimensions prime to p, are U-isotropic representations of the form ρ = ρ(Xη, χ), where
F → C×, and the dimensions dim(ρ) = #η. Thus if dim(ρ) is prime to p, then
η : UF /U 1
dim(ρ) = #η is a divisor of qF − 1.
(2) implies (3): If dim(ρ) is a divisor of qF − 1, then gcd(p, dim(ρ)) = 1. Then from Corollary
5.1.13, the alternating character X is U-isotropic and X = Xη for a character η ∈ (cid:92)
UF /U 1
F .
(3) implies (4): We know that

(cid:113)

(cid:113)

dim(ρ) =

[F× : Rad(Xη)] =

[F× : NK/F] = #η.

Here since K/F is abelian, we have dim(ρ)2 = [K : F]. Again since #η = dim(ρ) is a divisor
of qF − 1, hence K/F is tamely ramiﬁed.
(4) implies (1): If K/F is tamely ramiﬁed, then we can write U 1
F ×/NK/F is a quotient group of F ×/U 1
extension and NK/F = Rad(X), then X must be an alternating character of F ×/U 1
know that F × =< πF > × < ζ > ×U 1
implies F ×/U 1

F ⊂ NK/F ⊂ F ×, and hence
F . Therefore if K/F is the abelian tamely ramiﬁed
F . We also
F , where ζ is a root of unity of order qF − 1. This
F · ζ b,

F =< πF > × < ζ >. So each element x ∈ F ×/U 1

F can be written as x = πa

91

where a, b ∈ Z. We now take x1 = πa1
then

F ζ b1, x2 = πa2

F ζ b2 ∈ F ×/U 1

F , where ai, bi ∈ Z(i = 1, 2),

X(x1, x2) = X(πa1
= X(πa1
= χρ([πa1

F ζ b1, πa2
F , ζ b2) · X(ζ b1, πa2
F )
F , ζ b2]) · χρ([ζ b1, πa2

F ζ b2)

F ]).

But this implies X qF −1 ≡ 1 because ζ qF −1 = 1, which means that X is actually an al-
ternating character on F ×/(F ×(qF −1)U 1
F ), and therefore GF /GK is actually a quotient of
F ×/(F ×(qF −1)U 1
F ). We also know that U 1
F is a pro-p-group and therefore

U 1

F = (U 1

F )qF −1 ⊂ F ×.

Thus the cardinality of F ×/(F ×(qF −1)U 1

F ) is (qF − 1)2 because

F ×/(F ×(qF −1)U 1

F ) ∼= Z/(qF − 1)Z× < ζ >∼= ZqF −1 × ZqF −1.

Therefore dim(ρ) divides qF − 1. Hence dim(ρ) is prime to p.

Remark 5.1.15. We let Kη|F be the abelian bicyclic extension which corresponds to Rad(Xη) :

NKη/F = Rad(Xη),

Gal(Kη/F) ∼= F×/Rad(Xη).

Then we have fKη|F = eKη|F = #η and the maximal unramiﬁed subextension E/F ⊂ Kη/F
corresponds to a maximal isotropic subgroup, hence

We recall here that χ : K×

η → C× is a character such that (cf. Theorem 5.1.1(3))

ρ(Xη, χ) = IndE/F(χE),

In the following lemma we see the explicit description of the representation ρ = ρ(Xη, χ).

Lemma 5.1.16 (Explicit Lemma). Let ρ = ρ(Xη, χK) be a U-isotropic Heisenberg repre-
sentation of the absolute Galois group GF of a local ﬁeld F/Qp. Let K = Kη and let E/F be
the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in K/F . Then:

1. The norm map induces an isomorphism:

NK/E : K×

F /IF K× ∼→ IF E×/IFNK/E.

92

2. Let cK/F : F ×/Rad(Xη)∧F×/Rad(Xη) ∼= K×

F /IFK× be the isomorphism which is induced
by the commutator in the relative Weil-group WK/F . Then for units ε ∈ UF we explicitly
have:

cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) = N−1

K/E(N−1

E/F (ε)1−ϕE/F ),

where ϕE/F is the Frobenius automorphism for E/F and where N−1 means to take a
preimage of the norm map.

3. The restriction χK|K×

F

is characterized by:
χK ◦ cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) = Xη(ε, πF ) = η(ε),
for all ε ∈ UF , where cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) is explicitly given via (2).

Proof. (1). By the given conditions we have: K = Kη, and K/F is the bicyclic extension
with Rad(Xη) = NK/F, and E/F is the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in K/F . So K/E
and E/F both are cyclic, hence

E×
F = IF E×,

K×
E = IEK×.

From the diagram (3.6.1) on p. 41 of [13], we have

NK/E : K×

F /IF K× ∼→ E×

F /IFNK/E.

We also know that E×

F = IF E×. Thus the norm map NK/E induces an isomorphism:

NK/E : K×

F /IF K× ∼= IF E×/IFNK/E.

(2). By the given conditions, cK/F is the isomorphism which is induced by the commutator
in the relative Weil-group WK/F (cf. the map (5.1.3). Here Rad(Xη) = NK/F =: N. Then
from Proposition 1(iii) of [14] on p. 128, we have
cK/F : N ∧ F ×/N ∧ N

∼→ IF K×/IF K×

F

as an isomorphism by the map:

cK/F (x ∧ y) = N−1

K/F (x)1−φF (y),

where φF (y) ∈ Gal(K/F) for y ∈ F × by class ﬁeld theory. If y = πF , then by class ﬁeld
theory (cf. [30], p. 20, Theorem 1.1(a)), we can write φF (πF )|E = ϕE/F , where ϕE/F is the
Frobenius automorphism for E/F .

Now we come to our special case. Since E/F is unramiﬁed, we have UF ⊂ NE/F , and we

obtain (cf. [13], pp. 46-47 of Section 4.4 and the diagram on p. 302 of [11]):

NK/E ◦ cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) = N−1

E/F (ε)1−ϕE/F .

(5.1.22)

93

We also know (see the ﬁrst two lines under the upper diagram on p. 302 of [11]) that
F ⊆ NK/E. Here
E×

E/F (ε)1−ϕE/F ∈ IF E×/IFNK/E = E×
N−1

F /IFNK/E,

because E/F is cyclic, hence E×

F = IF E×. Therefore from equation (5.1.22) we can conclude:

cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) = N−1

K/E(N−1

E/F (ε)1−ϕE/F ).

χK ◦ cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) = χK(N−1

(3.) We know that the cK/F (ε ∧ πF ) ∈ K×
K/E(N−1
= χE ◦ NK/E(N−1
= χE(N−1
= η(ε).

F and χK : K×/IF K× → C×. Then we can write

K/E(N−1

since χK = χE ◦ NK/E

E/F (ε)1−ϕE/F ),
E/F (ε)1−ϕE/F ) = Xη(ε, πF )

This is true for all ε ∈ UF . Therefore we can conclude that χK|K×

F ⊂ F ×m, and therefore

Since U 1

F is a pro-p-group and gcd(m, p) = 1, we have (U 1

F ×/F ×m ∼= Zm × Zm,

We know that UF /U 1

F is a cyclic group of order qF − 1, hence

is a bicyclic group of order m2. So by class ﬁeld theory there is precisely one extension K/F
such that Gal(K/F) ∼= Zm × Zm and the norm group NK/F := NK/F (K×) = F ×m.

F . By the
given condition m|(qF − 1), hence UF /U 1
F has exactly one subgroup of order m. Then number
of elements of order m in UF /U 1
F is ϕ(m), the Euler’s ϕ-function of m. In this setting, we
have η ∈ (cid:92)

description of Heisenberg representations of a Galois group, see [11], pp. 301-304). The
condition (2H) corresponds to (5.1.3). Here the above Explicit Lemma 5.1.16 comes in.

94

Here due to our assumption both sides of (2H) are groups of order m. And if one choice

χK = χ0 has been ﬁxed, then all other χK are given as

χK = (χF ◦ NK/F ) · χ0,

(5.1.23)
for arbitrary characters of F ×. For an optimal choice χK = χ0, and order of χ0 we need the
following lemma.
Lemma 5.1.18. Let K/F be the extension of F/Qp for which Gal(K/F) = Zm × Zm. The
K×
F and IF K× are as above. Then the sequence

1 → U 1

F → UF /UF ∩ F ×m → 1

(5.1.24)

is exact, and the outer terms are both of order m, hence inner terms are both cyclic of order
qF − 1.
Proof. The sequence is exact because F ×m = NK/F (K×) is the group of norms, and F ×/F ×m ∼=
Zm × Zm implies that the right hand term3 is of order m. By our assumption the order of
K×
F /IF K× is m. Now we consider the exact sequence

K ∩ IF K× → K×

F /IF K× → U 1

F /U 1

KIF K× → 1.

(5.1.25)

Since the middle term has order m, the left term must have order 1, because U 1
K is a pro-
p-group and gcd(m, p) = 1. Hence the right term is also of order m. So the outer terms of
the sequence (5.1.24) have both order m, hence the inner terms must have the same order
qF − 1 = [UF : U 1
K are both
cyclic.

We now are in a position to choose χK = χ0 as follows:

2. we take it on U 1

4. we take it trivial for a ﬁxed prime element πK.

Under the above optimal choice of χ0, we have

F )(< πm

where ζ is a (qF − 1)-st root of unity. Then

F > × < ζ > ×U 1

F / < πm

F > × < ζ m > ×U 1

Hence |UF /UF ∩ F ×m| = m.

χ0 must be a character of order

(cid:89)

l|m

mqF −1 :=

lνl(qF −1),

which we will call the m-primary part of qF − 1, so it determines a cyclic extension L/K
of degree mqF −1 which is totally tamely ramiﬁed, and we can consider the Heisenberg repre-
sentation ρ = (X, χ0) of GF = Gal(F/F) is a representation of Gal(L/F), which is of order
m2 · mqF −1.
Proof. By the given conditions, m|qF − 1. Therefore we can write

lνl(qF −1) · (cid:89)
where l, p are prime, and mqF −1 =(cid:81)

qF − 1 =

l|m

p|qF −1, p(cid:45)m

l|m lνl(qF −1).

pνp(qF −1) = mqF −1 · (cid:89)

pνp(qF −1),

p|qF −1, p(cid:45)m

From the construction of χ0, πK ∈ Ker(χ0), hence the order of χ0 comes from the re-
striction to UK. Then the order of χ0 is mqF −1, because from Lemma 5.1.18, the order of
KIF K is qF − 1. Since order of χ0 is mqF −1, by class ﬁeld theory χ0 determines a cyclic
UK/U 1
extension L/K of degree mqF −1, hence

NL/K(L×) = Ker(χ0) = Ker(ρ).

This means GL is the kernel of ρ(X, χ0), hence ρ(X, χ0) is actually a representation of
GF /GL

∼= Gal(L/F).

Since GL is normal subgroup of GF , hence L/F is a normal extension of degree [L : F ] =

[L : K] · [K : F ] = mqF −1 · m2. Thus Gal(L/F) is of order m2 · mqF −1.

Moreover, since [L : K] = mqF −1 and gcd(m, p) = 1, L/K is tame. By construction we

have a prime πK ∈ Ker(χ0) = NL/K(L×), hence L/K is totally ramiﬁed extension.

Lemma 5.1.20. (Here L, K, and F are the same as in Lemma 5.1.19) Let F ab/F be the
maximal abelian extension. Then we have

L ⊃ L ∩ F ab ⊃ K ⊃ F,

{1} ⊂ G(cid:48) ⊂ Z(G) ⊂ G = Gal(L/F),

where [L : L ∩ F ab] = |G(cid:48)| = m and [L : K] = |Z(G)| = mqF −1.

Proof. Let F ab/F be the maximal abelian extension. Then we have

L ⊃ L ∩ F ab ⊃ K ⊃ F.

Here L ∩ F ab/F is the maximal abelian in L/F . Then from Galois theory we can conclude

Gal(L/L ∩ Fab) = [Gal(L/F), Gal(L/F)] =: G(cid:48).

96

Since Gal(L/F) = GF/Ker(ρ), and [[GF , GF ], GF ] ⊆ Ker(ρ), from relation (5.1.3) we have

G(cid:48) = [GF , GF ]/Ker(ρ) ∩ [GF, GF] = [GF, GF]/[[GF, GF], GF] ∼= K×

F /IFK×.

Again from sequence 5.1.25 we have |U 1

F /IF K×| = m. Hence |G(cid:48)| = m.
From the Heisenberg property of ρ, we have [[GF , GF ], GF ] ⊆ Ker(ρ), hence Gal(L/F) =
GF/Ker(ρ) is a two-step nilpotent group. This gives [G(cid:48), G] = 1, hence G(cid:48) ⊆ Z := Z(G).
Thus G/Z is abelian.

KIF K×| = |K×

KK×

F /U 1

Moreover, here Z is the scalar group of ρ, hence the dimension of ρ is:

dim(ρ) =(cid:112)[G : Z] = m

Therefore the order of Z is mqF −1 and Z = Gal(L/K).

Remark 5.1.21 (Special case: m = 2, hence p (cid:54)= 2). Now if we take m = 2, hence p (cid:54)= 2,
and choose χ0 as the above optimal choice, then we will have mqF −1 = 2qF −1 = 2-primary
factor of the number qF − 1, and Gal(L/F) is a 2-group of order 4 · 2qF −1.

When qF ≡ −1 (mod 4), qF is of the form qF = 4l − 1, where l (cid:62) 1. So we can write
qF − 1 = 2(2l − 1). Since 2l − 1 is always odd, therefore when qF ≡ −1 (mod 4), the order
of χ0 is 2qF −1 = 2. Then Gal(L/F) will be of order 8 if and only if qF ≡ −1 (mod 4), i.e., if
and only if i (cid:54)∈ F . And if qF ≡ 1 (mod 4), then similarly, we can write qF − 1 = 4m for some
integer m (cid:62) 1, hence 2qF −1 (cid:62) 4. Therefore when qF ≡ 1 (mod 4), the order of Gal(L/F) will
be at least 16.

5.1.2 Artin conductors, Swan conductors, and the dimensions of

Heisenberg representations

Deﬁnition 5.1.22 (Artin and Swan conductor). Let G be a ﬁnite group and R(G) be the
complex representation ring of G. For any two representations ρ1, ρ2 ∈ R(G) with characters
χ1, χ2 respectively, we have the Schur’s inner product:

< ρ1, ρ2 >G=< χ1, χ2 >G:=

1
|G|

χ1(g) · χ2(g).

(cid:88)

g∈G

Let K/F be a ﬁnite Galois extension with Galois group G := Gal(K/F). For an element
g ∈ G diﬀerent from identity 1, we deﬁne the non-negative integer (cf. [26], Chapter IV, p.
62)

iG(g) := inf{νK(x − g(x))| x ∈ OK}.

By using this non-negative (when g (cid:54)= 1) integer iG(g) we deﬁne a function aG : G → Z as
follows:

aG(g) = −fK/F · iG(g) when g (cid:54)= 1, and aG(1) = fK/F

97

(cid:80)

g(cid:54)=1 iG(g).

Thus from this deﬁnition we can see that(cid:80)

g∈G aG(g) = 0, hence < aG, 1G >= 0. It can be
proved (cf. [26], p. 99, Theorem 1) that the function aG is the character of a linear represen-
tation of G, and that corresponding linear representation is called the Artin representation
AG of G.

Similarly, for a nontrivial g (cid:54)= 1 ∈ G, we deﬁne (cf. [48], p. 247)

sG(g) = inf{νK(1 − g(x)x−1)| x ∈ K×},

And we can deﬁne a function swG : G → Z as follows:

swG(g) = −fK/F · sG(g)

sG(1) = −(cid:88)

sG(g).

g(cid:54)=1

It can also be shown that swG is a character of a linear representation of G, and that corre-
sponding representation is called the Swan representation SWG of G.

From [27], p. 160 , we have the relation between the Artin and Swan representations (cf.

[48], p. 248, equation (6.1.9))

SWG = AG + IndG

G0(1) − IndG{1}(1),

(5.1.26)

G0 is the 0-th ramiﬁcation group (i.e., inertia group) of G.

Now we are in a position to deﬁne the Artin and Swan conductor of a representation

ρ ∈ R(G). The Artin conductor of a representation ρ ∈ R(G) is deﬁned by

aF (ρ) :=< AG, ρ >G=< aG, χ >G,

where χ is the character of the representation ρ. Similarly, for the representation ρ, the Swan
conductor is:

swF(ρ) :=< SWG, ρ >G=< swG, χ >G .

For more details about Artin and Swan conductor, see Chapter 6 of [48] and Chapter VI of
[26].

From equation (5.1.26) we obtain

aF (ρ) = swF(ρ) + dim(ρ)− < 1, ρ >G0 .

(5.1.27)

Moreover, from Corollary of Proposition 4 on p. 101 of [26], for an induced representation
ρ := IndGal(K/F)

Gal(K/E)(ρE) = IndE/F(ρE), we have

aF (ρ) = fE/F ·(cid:0)dE/F · dim(ρE) + aE(ρE)(cid:1) .

(5.1.28)

We apply this formula (5.1.28) for ρE = χE of dimension 1 and then conversely

a(χE) =

aF (ρ)
fE/F

− dE/F .

So if we know aF (ρ) then we can compute a(χE).

98

Let {Gi}, where i (cid:62) 0,∈ Q be the ramiﬁcation subgroups (in the upper numbering) of a
local Galois group G. Now let ρ be an irreducible representation of G. For this irreducible ρ
we deﬁne

j(ρ) := max{i | ρ|Gi

(cid:54)≡ 1}.

Now if ρ is an irreducible representation of G which is not an unramiﬁed character, then
ρ|I (cid:54)≡ 1, where I = G0 = G0 is the inertia subgroup of G. Thus from the deﬁnition of j(ρ) we
can say, if ρ is irreducible, then we always have j(ρ) (cid:62) 0, i.e., ρ is nontrivial on the inertia
group G0. Then from the deﬁnitions of Swan and Artin conductors, and equation (5.1.27),
when ρ is irreducible, we have the following relations

swF(ρ) = dim(ρ) · j(ρ),

aF(ρ) = dim(ρ) · (j(ρ) + 1).

(5.1.29)

[26], p. 76), if dim(ρ) = 1, i.e., ρ is a character of
From the Theorem of Hasse-Arf (cf.
G/[G, G], we can say that j(ρ) must be an integer, then swF(ρ) = j(ρ), aF(ρ) = j(ρ) + 1.
Moreover, by class ﬁeld theory, ρ corresponds to a linear character χF , hence for linear
character χF , we can write

j(χF ) := max{i | χF|Ui

(cid:54)≡ 1},

F

because under class ﬁeld theory (under Artin isomorphism) the upper numbering in the
ﬁltration of Gal(Fab/F) is compatible with the ﬁltration (descending chain) of the group of
units UF .

From equation (5.1.29), it is easy to see that for higher dimensional ρ, we have swF(ρ), aF(ρ)

multiples of dim(ρ) if and only if j(ρ) is an integer.

Now we come to our Heisenberg representations. For each X ∈ (cid:91)F F × we deﬁne

j(X) :=

max{i | X|UUi

when X is trivial

(cid:54)≡ 1} when X is nontrivial,

(5.1.30)

0

where U U i ⊆ F F × is a subgroup which under (5.1.2) corresponds

F ∩ [GF , GF ]/Gi
Gi

F ∩ [[GF , GF ], GF ] ⊆ [GF , GF ]/[[GF , GF ], GF ].

Let ρ = ρ(Xρ, χK) be a minimal conductor (i.e., a representation with the smallest Artin
conductor) Heisenberg representation for Xρ of the absolute Galois group GF . From Theorem
3 on p. 125 of [14], we have

swF(ρ) = dim(ρ) · j(Xρ) =

[F× : Rad(Xρ)] · j(Xρ).

(5.1.31)

(cid:113)

Moreover if ρ0 = ρ0(X, χ0) is a minimal representation corresponding X, then all other
Heisenberg representations of dimension dim(ρ) are of the form ρ = χF ⊗ ρ0 = (X, (χF ◦
NK/F )χ0), where χF : F × → C×. Then we have (cf. [11], p. 305, equation (5))

swF(ρ) = swF(χF ⊗ ρ0) =(cid:112)[F× : Rad(X)] · max{j(χF), j(X)}.

(5.1.32)

For minimal conductor U-isotopic Heisenberg representation we have the following propo-

sition.

Proposition 5.1.23. Let ρ = ρ(Xη, χK) be a U-isotropic Heisenberg representation of GF of
minimal conductor. Then we have the following conductor relation

j(Xη) = j(η), swF(ρ) = dim(ρ) · j(Xη) = #η · j(η),

aF (ρ) = swF(ρ) + dim(ρ) = #η(j(η) + 1) = #η · aF(η).

Proof. From [14], on p. 126, Proposition 4(i) and Proposition 5(ii), and U ∧ U = U 1 ∧ U 1, we
see the injection U i ∧ F × ⊆ U U i induces a natural isomorphism
U i∧ < πF >∼= U U i/U U i ∩ (U ∧ U )

for all i (cid:62) 0.

Now let j(Xη) = n − 1, hence Xη|U U n = 1 but Xη|U U n−1 (cid:54)= 1. This gives Xη|U n∧<πF > = 1
but Xη|U n−1∧<πF > (cid:54)= 1. Now from equation (5.1.19) we can conclude that η(x) = 1 for all
x ∈ U n but η(x) (cid:54)= 1 for x ∈ U n−1. Hence

j(η) = n − 1 = j(Xη).

Again from the deﬁnition of j(χ), where χ is a character of F ×, we can see that j(χ) = a(χ)−1,
i.e., a(χ) = j(χ) + 1.

From equation (5.1.31) we obtain:

swF(ρ) = dim(ρ) · j(Xη) = #η · j(η),

since dim(ρ) = #η and j(Xη) = j(η). Finally, from equation (5.1.27) for ρ (here < 1, ρ >G0=
0), we have

aF (ρ) = swF(ρ) + dim(ρ) = #η · j(η) + #η = #η · (j(η) + 1) = #η · aF(η).

(5.1.33)

By using the equation (5.1.28) in our Heisenberg setting, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 5.1.24. Let ρ = ρ(Z, χρ) = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the
absolute Galois group GF of a ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension m. Let E/F be any subextension in
K/F corresponding to a maximal isotropic subgroup for X. Then

aF (ρ) = aF (IndE/F(χE)),

m · aF(ρ) = aF(IndK/F(χK)).

As a consequence we have

a(χK) = eK/E · a(χE) − dK/E.

In particular a(χK) = a(χE) if K/E is unramiﬁed.
Proof. We know that ρ = IndE/F(χE) and m · ρ = IndK/F(χK). By the deﬁnition of Artin
conductor we can write

aF (dim(ρ) · ρ) = dim(ρ) · aF(ρ) = m · aF(IndE/F(χE)).

100

Since K/E/F is a tower of Galois extensions with [K : E] = m = eK/EfK/E, we have the
transitivity relation of diﬀerent (cf. [26], p. 51, Proposition 8)

DK/F = DK/E · DE/F .

Now from the deﬁnition of diﬀerent of a Galois extension, and taking K-valuation we obtain:

dK/F = dK/E + eK/E · dE/F .

(5.1.34)

Now by using equation (5.1.28) we have:
m · aF (IndE/F(χE)) = m · fE/F

(cid:0)dE/F + a(χE)(cid:1) = m · fE/F · dE/F + eK/E · fK/F · a(χE), (5.1.35)

and

aF (IndK/F(χK)) = fK/F ·(cid:0)dK/F + a(χK)(cid:1) = fK/F · dK/F + fK/F · a(χK).

(5.1.36)

By using equation (5.1.34), from equations (5.1.35), (5.1.36), we have

a(χK) = eK/E · a(χE) − dK/E.

And when K/E is unramiﬁed, i.e., eK/E = 1 and dK/E = 0, hence a(χK) = a(χE).

Now by combining Proposition 5.1.24 with Proposition 5.1.23, we get the following result.

Lemma 5.1.25. Let ρ = ρ(Xη, χK) be a U-isotopic Heisenberg representation of minimal
conductor of the absolute Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . Let K = Kη
correspond to the radical of Xη, and let E1/F be the maximal unramiﬁed subextension, and
E/F be any maximal cyclic and totally ramiﬁed subextension in K/F . Let m denote the order
of η. Then ρ is induced by χE1 or by χE respectively, and we have

1. aE(χE) = m · a(η) − dE/F ,

2. aE1(χE1) = a(η),

3. and for the character χK ∈(cid:100)K×,

aK(χK) = m · a(η) − dK/F .

Moreover, aE(χE) = aK(χK).

Proof. Proof of these assertions follows from equation (5.1.28) and Proposition 5.1.23. When
ρ = IndE/F(χE), where E/F is a maximal cyclic and totally ramiﬁed subextension in K/F ,
from equation (5.1.28) we have

aF (ρ) = m · a(η) using Proposition 5.1.23,

= fE/F ·(cid:0)dE/F · 1 + aE(χE)(cid:1) ,
= 1 ·(cid:0)dE/F + aE(χE)(cid:1) .

since ρ = IndE/F(χE)

101

because E/F is totally ramiﬁed, hence fE/F = 1. This implies aE(χE) = m · a(η) − dE/F .

Similarly, when ρ = IndE1/F(χE1), where E1/F is the maximal unramiﬁed subextension in
K/F , hence fE1/F = m and dE1/F = 0, by using equation (5.1.28) we obtain aE1(χE1) = a(η).

Again from Proposition 5.1.24 we have

aK(χK) = m · a(χE1) − dK/E1 = m · a(η) − dK/F .

Finally, since E/F is a maximal cyclic totally ramiﬁed implies K/E is unramiﬁed and

therefore

dE/F = dK/F ,

and hence aE(χE) = aK(χK).

Remark 5.1.26. Assume that we are in the dimension m = #η prime to p case. Then from
Corollary 5.1.13, η must be a character of U/U 1 (for U = UF ), hence

a(η) = 1

aF (ρ0) = m.

Therefore in this case the minimal conductor of ρ is m, hence it is equal to the dimension of
ρ.

From the above Lemma 5.1.25, in this case we have

aE1(χE1) = a(η) = 1.

And K/F, E/F are tamely ramiﬁed of ramiﬁcation exponent eK/F = m, hence

aE(χE) = aK(χK) = m · a(η) − dK/F = m − (eK/F − 1) = m − (m − 1) = 1.

Thus we can conclude that in this case all three characters (i.e., χE1, χE, and χK) are of
conductor 1.

In the general case aE1(χE1) = a(η) and

aE(χE) = aK(χK) = m · a(η) − d,

where d = dE/F = dK/F , conductors will be diﬀerent.

In general, if ρ = ρ0⊗χF , where ρ0 is a ﬁnite dimensional minimal conductor representation

of GF , and χF ∈ (cid:99)F ×, then we have the following result.

Lemma 5.1.27. Let ρ0 be a ﬁnite dimensional representation of GF of minimal conductor.
Then we have

where ρ = ρ0 ⊗ χF = ρ(Xη, (χF ◦ NK/F )χ0) and χF ∈ (cid:99)F × with a(χF ) > a(ρ0)

aF (ρ) = dim(ρ0) · aF(χF),

dim(ρ).

(5.1.37)

102

Proof. From equation (5.1.29) we have aF (ρ0) = dim(ρ0) · (1 + j(ρ0)). By the given condition
ρ0 is of minimal conductor. So for representation ρ = ρ0 ⊗ χF , we have

aF (ρ) = aF (ρ0 ⊗ χF ) = dim(ρ0) · (1 + max{j(ρ0), j(χF)})

= dim(ρ0) · max{1 + j(χF), 1 + j(ρ0)}
= dim(ρ0) · max{a(χF), 1 + j(ρ0)}
= dim(ρ0) · aF(χF),

because by the given condition

a(χF ) >

a(ρ0)

dim(ρ0)

=

dim(ρ0) · (1 + j(ρ0))

dim(ρ0)

= 1 + j(ρ0).

Proposition 5.1.28. Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of dimension m of the
absolute Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F . Then m|aF (ρ) if and only if:
X is U -isotropic, or (if X is not U -isotropic) aF (ρ) is with respect to X not the minimal
conductor.

Proof. From the above Lemma 5.1.27 we know that if ρ is not minimal, then aF (ρ) is always
a multiple of the dimension m. So now we just have to check for minimal conductors. In the
U-isotropic case the minimal conductor is multiple of the dimension (cf. Proposition 5.1.23).
Finally, suppose that X is not U-isotropic, i.e., X|U∧U = X|U 1∧U 1 (cid:54)≡ 1, because U ∧ U =
U 1∧U 1 (see the Remark on p. 126 of [14]). We also know that U U i = (U U i∩U 1∧U 1)×(U i∧ <
πF >) (cf.
[14], p. 126, Proposition 5(ii)). In Proposition 5 of [14], we observe that all the
jumps v in the ﬁltration {U U i ∩ (U 1 ∧ U 1)}, i ∈ R+ are not integers with v > 1. This shows
that j(X) is also not an integer, hence aF (ρ0) is not multiple of the dimension. This implies
the conductor aF (ρ) is not minimal.

For giving invariant formula of W (ρ), we need to know the explicit dimension formula of ρ.
In the following theorem we give the general dimension formula of a Heisenberg representation.
Theorem 5.1.29 (Dimension). Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld and GF be the absolute Galois
group of F . If ρ is a Heisenberg representation of GF , then dim(ρ) = pn · d(cid:48), where n (cid:62) 0 is
an integer and where the prime to p factor d(cid:48) must divide qF − 1.

Proof. By the deﬁnition of Heisenberg representation ρ we have the relation

[[GF , GF ], GF ] ⊆ Ker(ρ).

Then we can consider ρ as a representation of G := GF /[[GF , GF ], GF ]. Since [x, g] ∈
[[GF , GF ], GF ] for all x ∈ [GF , GF ] and g ∈ GF , we have [G, G] = [GF , GF ]/[[GF , GF ], GF ] ⊆
Z(G), hence G is a two-step nilpotent group.

103

We know that each nilpotent group is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow sub-

groups. Therefore we can write

G = Gp × Gp(cid:48),

where Gp is the Sylow p-subgroup, and Gp(cid:48) is the direct product of all other Sylow subgroups.
Therefore each irreducible representation ρ has the form ρ = ρp ⊗ ρp(cid:48), where ρp and ρp(cid:48) are
irreducible representations of Gp and Gp(cid:48) respectively.

We also know that ﬁnite p-groups are nilpotent groups, and direct product of a ﬁnite
number of nilpotent groups is again a nilpotent group. So Gp and Gp(cid:48) are both two-step
nilpotent group because G is a two-step nilpotent group. Therefore the representations ρp
and ρp(cid:48) are both Heisenberg representations of Gp and Gp(cid:48) respectively.

Now to prove our assertion, we have to show that dim(ρp) can be an arbitrary power of
p, whereas dim(ρp(cid:48)) must divide qF − 1. Since ρp is an irreducible representation of p-group
Gp, so the dimension of ρp is some p-power.

Again from the construction of ρp(cid:48) we can say that dim(ρp(cid:48)) is prime to p. Then from

Lemma 5.1.14 dim(ρp(cid:48)) is a divisor of qF − 1.

This completes the proof.

Remark 5.1.30. (1). Let VF be the wild ramiﬁcation subgroup of GF . We can show that ρ|VF
is irreducible if and only if Zρ = GK ⊂ GF corresponds to an abelian extension K/F which
is totally ramiﬁed and wildly ramiﬁed4 (cf. [11], p. 305). If N := NK/F (K×) is the subgroup
of norms, then this means that N · U 1

F = F ×, in other words,
F /N ∩ U 1
F ,

F /N = U 1

F ×/N = N · U 1

where N can be also considered as the radical of Xρ. So we can consider the alternating
character Xρ on the principal units U 1

dim(ρ) =(cid:112)[F× : N] =

(cid:113)
F ⊂ F ×. Then

F : N ∩ U1
F],

[U1

is a power of p, because U 1

F is a pro-p-group.

Here we observe: If ρ = ρ(X, χK) with ρ|VF stays irreducible, then dim(ρ) = pn, n (cid:62) 1 and
K/F is a totally and wildly ramiﬁed. But there is a big class of Heisenberg representations ρ
such that dim(ρ) = pn is a p-power, but which are not wild representations (see the Deﬁnition
5.1.8 of U-isotropic).
(2). Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois group GF of
dimension d > 1 which is prime to p. Then from above Lemma 5.1.14, we have d|qF − 1. For
this representation ρ, here K/F must be tame if Rad(X) = NK/F (cf. [20], p. 115).

4Group theoretically, if ρ|VF = IndGF

H (χH)|VF is irreducible, then from Section 7.4 of [27], we can say
GF = H · VF . Here H = GL, where L is a certain extension of F , and VF = GFmt where Fmt/F is the
maximal tame extension of F . Therefore GF = H · VF is equivalent to F = L∩ Fmt that means the extension
L/F must be totally ramiﬁed and wildly ramiﬁed, and [GF : H] = [L : F ] = |VF|. We know that the wild
ramiﬁcation subgroup VF is a pro-p-group (cf. [20], p. 106). Then dim(ρ) is a power of p.

Invariant formula for W (ρ)

Lemma 5.2.1. Let ρ = ρ(Z, χZ) be a Heisenberg representation of the local Galois group

G = Gal(L/F ) of odd dimension. Let H be a maximal isotropic subgroup for ρ and χH ∈ (cid:98)H

with χH|Z = χZ then:

W (ρ) = W (χH), W (ρ)dim(ρ) = W (χZ),

and

W (χH)[H:Z] = W (χZ).

Proof. From the construction of Heisenberg representation ρ of G we have

(5.2.1)

(5.2.2)

H(χH),
This implies that W (ρ) = λG

ρ = IndG

H · W (χH) and W (ρ)dim(ρ) = λG

Z · W (χZ).

dim(ρ) · ρ = IndG

Z (χZ).

Since dim(ρ) is odd we may apply now Lemma 3.2.2, and we obtain

H = λG
λG

Z = 1.

So, we have W (ρ) = λG

H(W ) · W (χH) = W (χH). Similarly, we have W (ρ)dim(ρ) = W (χZ).

Moreover, it is easy to see5 that W (IndH

Z (χZ)) = W(χH)[H:Z]. By the given condition,

[H : Z] = dim(ρ) is odd, hence λH

Z = 1, then we have

W (χH)[H:Z] = W (IndH

Z (χZ)) = W(χZ).

(5.2.3)

Remark 5.2.2. Related to G ⊃ H ⊃ Z we have the base ﬁelds F ⊂ E ⊂ K, and χZ is the
restriction of χH. In arithmetic terms this means:

χK = χE ◦ NK/E.

So in arithmetic terms of W (IndG

Z (χZ)) = W(IndG

H(χH))[G:H] is as follows:

W (IndK/F(χK), ψ) = W(IndE/F(χE), ψ)[K:E].

5We have

and IndH

Z χZ of dimension d = [H : Z]. Therefore:

d · ρ = IndG

Z χZ = IndG

H (IndH

Z χZ),

W (ρ)d = (λG

H )d · W (IndH

Z χZ).

On the other hand W (ρ) = λG

H · W (χH ) implies

W (ρ)d = (λG

H )d · W (χH )d.

Now comparing these two expressions for W (ρ)d we see that

W (χH )d = W (IndH

Z χZ).

105

Then from λK/F = λK/E · λ[K:E]

E/F we can conclude that
λK/E · W (χK, ψK) = W (χE, ψE)[K:F ].

If the dimension dim(ρ) = [K : E] is odd, we have λK/E = 1, because K/E is Galois. Then
we obtain

W (χE, ψE)[K:E] = W (χE ◦ NK/E, ψE ◦ TrK/E).

(5.2.4)

The formula (5.2.4) is known as a Davenport-Hasse relation.

Corollary 5.2.3. Let ρ = ρ(Z, χZ) be a Heisenberg representation of a local Galois group G.
Let dim(ρ) = d be odd. Let the order of W (χZ) be n (i.e., W (χZ)n = 1). If d is prime to n,
then dϕ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, and

W (ρ) = W (χZ)

1

d = W (χZ)dϕ(n)−1,

where ϕ(n) is the Euler’s totient function of n.

Proof. By our assumption, here d and n are coprime. Therefore from Euler’s theorem we
can write

dϕ(n) ≡ 1 mod n.

This implies dϕ(n) − 1 is a multiple of n.

Here d is odd, then from the above Lemma 5.2.1 we have W (ρ)d = W (χZ). So we obtain

W (ρ) = W (χZ)

1

d = W (χZ)dϕ(n)−1,

since dϕ(n) − 1 is a multiple of n, and by assumption W (χZ)n = 1.

We observe that when dim(ρ) = d is odd, if we take second part of the equation (5.2.1),
we have W (ρ) = W (χZ) 1
d , but it is not well-deﬁned in general. Here we have to make precise
which root W (χZ) 1
d really occurs. That is why, giving invariant formula of W (ρ) using λ-
functions computation is diﬃcult. In the following theorem we give an invariant formula of
local constant for Heisenberg representation modulo certain roots of unity.

Theorem 5.2.4. Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois
group GF of a local ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension d. Let ψ be a nontrivial canonical additive
character of F and ψK := ψ ◦ TrK/F. Denote µp∞ as the group of roots of unity of p-power
order and µn as the group of n-th roots of unity, where n > 1 is an integer.

1. When the dimension d is odd, we have

W (ρ, ψ) ≡ W (χρ)(cid:48) mod µd,

where W (χρ)(cid:48) is any d-th root of W (χK, ψK).

2. When the dimension d is even, we have

106

W (ρ, ψ) ≡ W (χρ)(cid:48) mod µd(cid:48),

where d(cid:48) = lcm(4, d).

Proof. (1). We know that the lambda functions are always fourth roots of unity. In particular,
when degree of the Galois extension K/F is odd, from Theorem 3.2.3 we have λK/F = 1. For
proving our assertions we will use these facts about λ-functions.

We know that dim(ρ)· ρ = IndK/F(χK), where by class ﬁeld theory χK ↔ χρ is a character

of K×. When d is odd, we can write

W (ρ, ψ)d = λK/F (ψ) · W (χK, ψK) = W (χK, ψK).

Now let W (χρ)(cid:48) be any d-th root of W (χK, ψK). Then we have

W (ρ, ψ)d = W (χρ)(cid:48)d,

hence W (ρ,ψ)

W (χρ)(cid:48) is a d-th root of unity. Therefore we have

W (ρ, ψ) ≡ W (χρ)(cid:48) mod µd.

(2). Similarly, we can give invariant formula for even degree Heisenberg representations.
When the dimension d of ρ is even, we have

W (ρ, ψ)d = λK/F (ψ) · W (χK, ψK) ≡ W (χK, ψK) mod µ4,

(5.2.5)
because λK/F is a fourth root of unity. Now let W (χρ)(cid:48) be any d-th root of W (χK, ψK), hence
W (χK, ψK) = W (χρ)(cid:48)d. Then from equation (5.2.5) we have

(cid:18) W (ρ, ψ)

W (χρ)(cid:48)

(cid:19)d ≡ 1 mod µ4.

Therefore we can conclude that

where d(cid:48) = lcm(4, d).

W (ρ, ψ) ≡ W (χρ)(cid:48) mod µd(cid:48),

(5.2.6)

In the following theorem we give an invariant formula for W (ρ, ψ), where ρ = ρ(X, χK)
is a minimal conductor Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois group GF of a local
ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension m which is prime to p.

Theorem 5.2.5. Let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a minimal conductor Heisenberg representation of
the absolute Galois group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension m with
gcd(m, p) = 1. Let ψ be a nontrivial additive character of F . Then

W (ρ, ψ) = R(ψ, c) · L(ψ, c),

(5.2.7)

107

where

R(ψ, c) := λE/F (ψ)∆E/F (c) = λE/F (cψ)

is a fourth root of unity that depends on c ∈ F × with νF (c) = 1 + n(ψ) but not on the totally
ramiﬁed cyclic subextension E/F in K/F , and

where E1/F is the unramiﬁed extension of F of degree m.

Before proving this Theorem 5.2.5 we need to prove the following lemma.

Lemma 5.2.6. (With the notation of the above theorem)

1. Let E/F be any totally ramiﬁed cyclic extension of degree m inside K/F . Then:

∆E/F () =: ∆(),

for all  ∈ UF ,

does not depend on E if we restrict to units of F .

2. We have L(ψ, c) = ∆()L(ψ, c), and therefore changing c by unit we see that

∆E/F (c) · L(ψ, c) = ∆()2∆E/F (c) · L(ψ, c) = ∆E/F (c)L(ψ, c).

3. We also have the transformation rule R(ψ, c) = ∆() · R(ψ, c).

Proof. (1). Denote G := Gal(E/F). From equation (3.3.7) and by class ﬁeld theory we know
that

ωE(cid:48)/F when rk2(G) = 1

when rk2(G) = 0,

∆E/F =

(5.2.8)

where E(cid:48)/F is a uniquely determined quadratic extension inside E/F , and ωE(cid:48)/F is the
quadratic character of F × which corresponds to the extension E(cid:48)/F by class ﬁeld theory.
∼= 1. So for odd case, the assertion (1) is

When m is odd, i.e., rk2(G) = 0, hence ∆E/F

obvious.

When m is even, we choose two diﬀerent totally ramiﬁed cyclic subextensions, namely

L1/F, L2/F , in K/F of degree m. Then we can write for all  ∈ UF ,

∆L1/F () = ωE(cid:48)/F () = η() · ωE(cid:48)/F () = ωE(cid:48)/F () = ∆L2/F (),

where η is the unramiﬁed quadratic character of F ×. This proves that ∆E/F does not depend
on E if we restrict to UF .
(2). From Proposition 5.1.7 we know that det(ρ)(x) = ∆E/F (x)· χK ◦ N−1
K/E(x) for all x ∈ F ×.
Let E1/F be the unramiﬁed subextension in K/F of degree m. Then we have EE1 = K and

NK/E|E1 = NE1/F ,

(E×

E ⊂ Ker(χK).

108

Moreover, UF ⊂ NE1/F and therefore we may write N−1
we can write:

R(ψ, c) = λE/F (ψ)∆E/F (c) = λE/F (ψ)∆E/F ()∆E/F (c)

= ∆()λE/F (ψ)∆E/F (c) = ∆() · R(ψ, c).

Now we are in a position to give a proof of Theorem 5.2.5 by using Lemma 5.2.6.

Proof of Theorem 5.2.5. By the given conditions: ρ = ρ(X, χK) is a minimal conductor
Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois group GF of a local ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension
m which is prime to p. This means we are in the situation: ρ = ρ(X, χK) = ρ(Xη, χK), where
η is a character of UF /U 1

F , and dim(ρ) = #η = m.

Since ρ is of minimal conductor, we have a(ρ0) = m. Then from Remark 5.1.26 we have

a(χK) = 1.

Now we choose E/F ⊂ K/F a totally ramiﬁed cyclic subextension of degree [E : F ] = m,
hence kE = kF the same residue ﬁelds, and K/E is unramiﬁed of degree m. Then we can
write ρ = IndE/F(χE), and a(χE) = 1. Again, from Proposition 5.1.7 we have

det(ρ)(x) = ∆E/F (x) · χK ◦ N−1

K/E(x)

for all x ∈ F ×.

Then for all x ∈ F ×, we can write
χK ◦ N−1

K/E(x) = χE(x) = ∆E/F (x) · det(ρ)(x).

This is true for all subextensions6 E/F in K/F which are cyclic of degree m.

6In K/F of type Zm × Zm any cyclic subextension E/F in K/F of degree m will correspond to a maximal

isotropic subgroup. But we restrict to choosing E totally ramiﬁed or unramiﬁed.

109

Now we come to our particular choice: ρ = IndE/F(χE), with a(χE) = 1 and E/F is totally

ramiﬁed. We can write

W (ρ, ψ) = W (IndE/F(χE), ψ) = λE/F(ψ) · W(χE, ψ ◦ TrE/F)

= λE/F (ψ) · q

where vE(cE) = 1 + n(ψ ◦ TrE/F) = eE/F(1 + n(ψ)). This implies that we can choose cF ∈ F ×
such that νF (cF = cE) = 1 + n(ψ). Let E1/F be the unramiﬁed subextension in K/F , then
for each  ∈ UF , we have N−1
E1/F () where NE1/F := NK/E|E1. Since E/F is totally
ramiﬁed, we have qE = qF . And when x ∈ F ×, we have TrE/F(x) = mx.

K/E() = N−1

Then the above formula rewrites:

Now it is clear that L(ψ, c) depends on c but not on the totally ramiﬁed cyclic extension E/F
which we have chosen.

Again we know that λE/F (ψ) is a fourth root of unity and ∆E/F (c) ∈ {±1}. Therefore it

is easy to see that R(ψ, c) is a fourth root of unity. So to call our expression

W (ρ, ψ) = R(ψ, c) · L(ψ, c)

is invariant, we are left to show R(ψ, c) does not depend on the the totally ramiﬁed cyclic
subextension E/F in K/F .

From equation (3.4.3) we can write here

R(ψ, c) = λE/F (ψ)∆E/F (c) = λE/F (cψ) = λE/F (ψ(cid:48)),

where ψ(cid:48) = cψ, hence n(ψ(cid:48)) = νF (c) + n(ψ) = 1 + n(ψ) + n(ψ) = 2n(ψ) + 1.

When m(= [E : F ]) is odd, we have λE/F (ψ(cid:48)) = 1, hence R(ψ, c) = λE/F (cψ) = 1. Thus
in the odd case R(ψ, c) is independent of the choice of the totally ramiﬁed subextension E/F
in K/F .

110

When m is even, we have

R(ψ, c) = λE/F (ψ(cid:48)) = λE/E(cid:48)(ψ(cid:48)(cid:48)) · λ[E:E(cid:48)(cid:48)]
E(cid:48)/F

= λE(cid:48)/F (ψ(cid:48))±1,

where [E(cid:48), F ] is the 2-primary part of m, hence [E : E(cid:48)] is odd. Here the sign only depends
on m but not on E. So we can restrict to the case where m = [E : F ] is a power of 2. Let
E2/F be the unique quadratic subextension in E/F . Since E/F is a cyclic tame extension,
from Corollary 3.3.11(1), we obtain:

λE2/F (ψ(cid:48))

β(−1) · λE2/F (ψ(cid:48))

λE/F (ψ(cid:48)) =

if [E : F ] (cid:54)= 4
if [E : F ] = 4,

(5.2.9)

where β is the character of F ×/NE/F of order 4.

Since here n(ψ(cid:48)) = 2n(ψ)+1 is odd7, from Remark 3.4.11 (see the table of Remark 3.4.11)

we can tell that λE2/F (ψ(cid:48)) is invariant.
Finally, we have to see that β(−1) does not depend on E if [E : F ] = 4.
UF /UF∩N ∼= Z4, where N = NE/F (E×). Again U 1
UF . We know that UF /U 1
UF , which does not depend on E. Hence, UF ∩ N does not depend on E.

Since E/F is totally ramiﬁed of degree 4, we have F × = UF ·N , hence F ×/N = UF N/N =
F ⊂ N∩UF ⊂
F is a cyclic group. Therefore N ∩ UF is determined by its index in

F ⊂ N , hence U 1

F ⊂ UF , and U 1

We also know that there are two characters of UF /UF ∩ N of order 4, and they are inverse

to each other. Then

β(−1) = β(−1)−1 = β−1(−1)

is the same in both cases. Since β is the character which corresponds to E/F by class ﬁeld
F , hence a(β) = 1. It clearly shows that β(−1)
theory, we can say β is a character of F ×/U 1
does not depend on E. So we can conclude that R(ψ, c) does not depend on E.

Thus our expression W (ρ, ψ) = R(ψ, c) · L(ψ, c) does not depend on the choice of the
totally ramiﬁed cyclic subextension E/F in K/F . Moreover, we notice that we have the
transformation rules

R(ψ, c) = ∆()R(ψ, c),

L(ψ, c) = ∆()L(ψ, c),

for all  ∈ UF . Again ∆()2 = 1, hence the product R(ψ, c) · L(ψ, c) = R(ψ, c) · L(ψ, c) =
W (ρ, ψ) does not depend on the choice of c.

Therefore, ﬁnally, we can conclude our formula W (ρ, ψ) = R(ψ, c)L(ψ, c) is an invariant

expression.

Now let ρ = ρ(X, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of dimension prime to p but the

Proposition 5.2.7. Let ρ = ρ(Xη, χK) be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois
group GF of a non-archimedean local ﬁeld F/Qp of dimension m prime to p. Then it is of
minimal conductor aF (ρ) = m if and only if ρ is a representation of GF /VF , where VF is the
subgroup of wild ramiﬁcation.

Proof. By the given condition, the dimension dim(ρ) = m is prime to p. Then from Lemma
5.1.14 we can conclude that K/F is tamely ramiﬁed with fK/F = eK/F = m (cf. Remark
5.1.15)and hence dK/F = eK/F − 1 = m − 1. Then from the conductor formula (5.1.28) we
can easily see that a(ρ) = m is minimal if and only if a(χK) = 1.

Further, for some extension L/K, if NL/K = Ker(χK), then by class ﬁeld theory we can

conclude: L/K is tamely ramiﬁed if and only if a(χK) = 1.

Now suppose that ρ is a Heisenberg representation of G := GF /VF of dimension m prime
to p. This implies VF ⊂ Ker(ρ) = Ker(χK) = NL/K, where L/K is some tamely ramiﬁed
extension. Then a(χK) = 1, hence a(ρ) = m is minimal.

Conversely, when conductor a(ρ) = m is minimal, we have a(χK) = 1. By class ﬁeld
theory this character χK determines an extension L/K such that NL/K = Ker(χK). Since
a(χK) = 1, here L/K must be tamely ramiﬁed, hence L/F is tamely ramiﬁed. This means
VF sits in the kernel Ker(ρ) = GL , therefore ρ is actually a representation of GF /VF .

Theorem 5.2.8. Let ρ = ρ(Xη, χK) = ρ0 ⊗(cid:102)χF be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute
where ρ0 = ρ0(Xη, χ0) is a minimal conductor Heisenberg representation of GF and (cid:102)χF :

WF → C× corresponds to χF : F × → C× by class ﬁeld theory. If a(χF ) (cid:62) 2, then we have

W (ρ, ψ) = W (ρ0 ⊗(cid:102)χF , ψ) = W (χF , ψ)m · det(ρ0)(c),

(5.2.10)

where ψ is a nontrivial additive character of F , and c := c(χF , ψ) ∈ F ×, satisﬁes

Proof. Step-1: By the given conditions,

ρ = ρ0 ⊗ (cid:103)χχF ,

where ρ0 is a minimal conductor Heisenberg representation of GF of dimension m prime to

p and (cid:102)χF : WF → C× corresponds to χF : F × → C× by class ﬁeld theory. And 8 here
χ : F ×/F ×m → C× such that ρ0 = ρ0 ⊗(cid:101)χ.

Let ζ be a (qF − 1)-st root of unity. Since U 1
8We also know that there are m2 characters of F ×/F ×m such that ρ0⊗(cid:101)χ = ρ0 (cf. [11], p. 303, Proposition

ρ = ρ0 ⊗(cid:102)χF = ρ0 ⊗ (cid:103)χχF ,

112

that is, a direct product of two cyclic group of same order. Hence F ×/F ×m ∼=
(cid:92)F ×/F ×m.
F , and F ×/F ×m ∼= Zm × Zm, we have a(χ) (cid:54) 1 and #χ
Since F ×m =< πm
is a divisor of m for all χ ∈ (cid:92)F ×/F ×m. Now if we take a character χF of F × conductor (cid:62) 2,
hence a(χF ) (cid:62) 2a(χ) for all χ ∈ (cid:92)F ×/F ×m. Then by using Deligne’s formula (2.3.17) we have

F > × < ζ >m ×U 1

W (χχF , ψ)m = χ(c)m · W (χF , ψ)m = W (χF , ψ)m,

(5.2.12)

where c ∈ F × with νF (c) = a(χF ) + n(ψ), satisﬁes

χF (1 + x) = ψ(c−1x),

for all x ∈ F × with 2νF (x) (cid:62) a(χ).

Now from Proposition 5.2.7 we can consider the representation ρ0 as a representation of
G := Gal(Fmt/F), where Fmt/F is the maximal tamely ramiﬁed subextension in ¯F /F . Then
we can write

ρ0 = IndE/F(χE,0),

ρ = IndE/F(χE),

where E/F is a cyclic tamely ramiﬁed subextension of K/F of degree m and

χE := χE,0 ⊗ (χF ◦ NE/F ).

Step-2: Let G be a ﬁnite group and R(G) be the character ring provided with the tensor
product as multiplication and the unit representation as unit element. Then for any zero
dimensional representation Π ∈ R(G) we have (cf. Theorem 2.1(h) on p. 40 of [39]):

Π =

nHIndG

H(χH − 1H),

where nH ∈ Z (cf. Proposition 2.24 on p. 48 of [39]) and χH ∈ (cid:98)H. Moreover, from Theorem

2.1 (k) of [39] we know that nH (cid:54)= 0 only if Z(G) (cid:54) H and χH|Z(G) = χZ, where Z(G) is the
center of G and χZ is the center character.

Now we will use this above formula (5.2.13) for the representation ρ0 − m · 1F and we get

χ0 = χEi ◦ NK/Ei.

Since a(χ0) = 1 and K/Ei are cyclic tamely ramiﬁed9, we have a(χEi) = 1 for all i =

9The subﬁelds Ei ⊆ K are related to Boltje’s approach by Gal(K/Ei) = Hi/Z(G) and the fact that
χHi extends the character χZ which translates via class ﬁeld theory to χEi ◦ NK/Ei = χK. Moreover,
X = χZ ◦ [−,−] and χZ extendible to Hi means that Gal(K/Ei) = Hi/Z(G) must be isotropic for X, hence
in our situation K/Ei must be a cyclic extension of degree dividing m.

5.3 Applications of Tate’s root-of-unity criterion
Let K/F be a ﬁnite Galois extension of the non-archimedean local ﬁeld F , and ρ : Gal(K/F ) →
AutC(V ) a representation of Gal(K/F ) on a complex vector space V . Let P (K/F ) denote
the ﬁrst wild ramiﬁcation group of K/F . Let V P be the subspace of all elements of V ﬁxed
by ρ(P (K/F )). Then ρ induces a representation:

ρP : Gal(K/F )/P (K/F ) → AutC(V P ).

Let F be an algebraic closure of the local ﬁeld F , and GF = Gal(F/F) be the absolute Galois
group for F /F . Let ρ be a representation of GF .
Then by Tate, W (ρ)/W (ρP ) is a root of a unity (cf. [31], p. 112, Corollary 4).
Now let ρ be an irreducible representation GF , then either ρP = ρ, in which case W (ρ)
W (ρP ) = 1,
or else ρP = 0, in this case from Tate’s result we can say W (ρ) is a root of unity. Equivalently:
If W (ρ) is not a root of unity then ρP (cid:54)= 0, hence ρP = ρ because ρ is irreducible. This means
that all vectors v ∈ V of the representation space are ﬁxed under P action on V .
In other words, if we consider ρ as a homomorphism ρ : GF → AutC(V) then the elements
from P are mapped to the identity, hence

ρP = ρ means P ⊂ Ker(ρ).

Therefore we can state the following lemma.
Lemma 5.3.1. If ρ is an irreducible representation of GF , such that the subgroup P ⊂ GF ,
of wild ramiﬁcation does not trivially act on the representation space V (this gives ρP (cid:54)= ρ,
i.e., ρP = 0), then W (ρ) is a root of unity.

Before going to our next results we need to recall some facts from class ﬁeld theory. Let
F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld. Let F ab be the maximal abelian extension of F and Fnr
be the maximal unramiﬁed extension of F . Then by local class ﬁeld theory there is a unique
homomorphism

θF : F × → Gal(Fab/F)

having certain properties (cf.
[30], p. 20, Theorem 1.1). This local reciprocity map θF is
continuous and injective with dense image. From class ﬁeld theory we have the following
commutative diagram

0 → UF →

F ×
↓ θF

vF
→ Z → 0

0 → IF → Gal(Fab/F) → (cid:98)Z → 0,

↓ θF

↓ id

where IF := Gal(Fab/Fnr) is the inertia subgroup of Gal(Fab/F), and Gal(Fnr/F) is identiﬁed

with(cid:98)Z (cf. [28], p. 144). We also know that θF : UF → IF is an isomorphism. Moreover, the

descending chain

UF ⊃ U 1

F ⊃ U 2

F ···

115

is mapped isomorphically by θF to the descending chain of ramiﬁcation subgroups of Gal(Fab/F)
in the upper numbering.

Now let I be the inertia subgroup of GF . Let P be the wild ramiﬁcation subgroup of GF .

Then we have GF ⊃ I ⊃ P . Parallel with this we have F × ⊃ UF ⊃ U 1

F . Then we have

1 → I/P · [GF , GF ] → GF /P · [GF , GF ] → GF /I → 1,

and parallel

1 → UF /U 1

F → F ×/U 1

F → F ×/UF → 1.

(5.3.1)

(5.3.2)

Now by class ﬁeld theory the left terms of sequences (5.3.1) and (5.3.2) are isomorphic, but
for the right terms we have GF /I is isomorphic to the total completion of Z (because here
Therefore sequence (5.3.2) is dense in (5.3.1) because Z is dense in the total completion (cid:98)Z.
∼= Z.
GF /I is proﬁnite group, hence compact). We also have F ×/UF =< πF > ×UF /UF
But Z and (cid:98)Z have the same ﬁnite factor groups. As a consequence F ×/U 1

F is also dense

in GF /P · [GF , GF ].

Let ρ be a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois group GF . In the following

proposition we show that if W (ρ) is not a root of unity, then dim(ρ)|(qF − 1).
Proposition 5.3.2. Let F/Qp be a local ﬁeld and let qF = ps be the order of its ﬁnite residue
ﬁeld. If ρ = (Zρ, χρ) = ρ(Xρ, χK) is a Heisenberg representation of the absolute Galois group
GF such that W (ρ) is not a root of unity, then dim(ρ)|(qF − 1).

Proof. Let P denote the wild ramiﬁcation subgroup of GF . By Tate’s root-of-unity criterion,
we know that γ := W (ρ)
W (ρP ) is a root of unity. If W (ρ) is not a root of unity, then ρ = ρP ,
otherwise W (ρ) must be a root of unity. Again ρP = ρ implies P ⊂ Ker(ρ) ⊂ Zρ ⊂ GF. So
GF /Zρ is a quotient of GF /P , hence F ×/U 1

Moreover, from the dimension formula (5.1.6), we have

6.1 Lamprecht-Tate formula for W (χ)

Theorem 6.1.1 (Lamprecht-Tate formula). Let F be a non-archimedean local ﬁeld. Let
χ be a character of F × of exponential Artin-conductor a(χ) = aF (χ) and let m be a natural
number such that 2m (cid:54) a(χ). Let ψF be the canonical additive character of F . Then there

Remark: Note that the assumption (6.1.1) is obviously fulﬁlled for m = 0 because then both
sides are = 1, and the resulting formula for m = 0 is the original formula (2.3.4) for abelian
local constant W (χ).

Proof. We have seen already that for m = 0 everything is correct. In general, the assumption
2m (cid:54) a(χ) implies 2(a(χ) − m) (cid:62) a(χ) and therefore

χ(1 + y)χ(1 + y(cid:48)) = χ(1 + y + y(cid:48))

. That is, y (cid:55)→ χ(1 + y) is a character of the additive group P a(χ)−m

for y, y(cid:48) ∈ P a(χ)−m
. This
character extends to a character of F + and, by local additive duality, there is some c ∈ F ×
such that

Now comparing the conductors of both sides we must have:

a(χ) = −n(c−1ψF ) = νF (c) − n(ψF ),

hence νF (c) = a(χ) + n(ψF ) = a(χ) + dF/Qp is the right assumption for our formula.
Now we assume m (cid:62) 1 (the case m = 0 we have checked already) and consider the ﬁltration

Now using (6.1.1) we obtain

χ−1(z(1 + y))ψF (c−1z(1 + y)).

(6.1.3)

χ−1(z(1 + y)) = χ−1(z)χ−1(1 + y) = χ−1(z)χ(1 − y) = χ−1(z)ψF (−c−1y)

and therefore our double sum (6.1.3) rewrites as

But the inner sum is the sum on the additive group P a(χ)−m

So the character (c−1(z − 1))ψF is trivial on P a(χ)−νF (z−1)
P a(χ)−m

if and only if νF (z − 1) (cid:62) m, i.e., z = 1 + y(cid:48) ∈ 1 + P m

Corollary 6.1.2. Let χ be a character of F ×. Let ψ be a nontrivial additive character of F .

1. When a(χ) = 2d (d (cid:62) 1), we have

W (χ) = χ(c)ψ(c−1).

W (αβ, ψ) = β(c) · W (α, ψ).

Here c ∈ F × with F -valuation νF (c) = a(χ) + n(ψF ), and in Case (1) and Case (2), c also
satisﬁes

χ(1 + x) = ψ( x

And in case (3), we have α(1 + x) = ψ(x/c) for all νF (x) (cid:62) a(α)

Proof. From the above formula (6.1.2), the assertions are followed.
(1). When a(χ) = 2d, where d (cid:62) 1. In this case, we take m = d, and from equation (6.1.2)
we obtain

W (χ, ψ) = χ(c) · (cid:88)

χ−1(x)ψ(c−1x) = χ(c) · ψ(c−1).

(6.1.5)

(3) Proof of Deligne’s twisting formula (2.3.17): By the given condition, a(α) (cid:62) 2a(β),
hence we have a(αβ) = a(α). Now take m = a(β), then from equation (6.1.2) we can write:

Remark 6.1.3. Let µp∞ denote as the group of roots of unity of p-power order. Let F be a
non-archimedean local ﬁeld. Let ψF be an additive character of F . Since ψF is additive, its
image lies in µp∞. We also know that U 1

F is a pro-p-group, hence χ(U 1

F ) ⊂ µp∞.

1. When a(χ) is even, we have

W (χ, ψF ) = χ(c) · ψF (c−1).

(6.1.6)

Now we give explicit formula for W (χ, ψF ) modulo µp∞. For this it is suﬃcient to know
c ∈ F ×mod 1 + PF.

As for the correcting term it is ≡ 1 mod µp∞ in case p = 2. If p (cid:54)= 2 we compare the

(6.1.10)

1. W (χ, ψF ) ≡ χ(c) mod µp∞ if a(χ) is even,

Remark 6.1.4 (On G(c)). Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q element and q is odd. Let ψ0 be a
nontrivial additive character of Fq. Let η be the quadratic character of F×
q . Then from the
generalization (cf. [3], p. 47, Problem 24) of Theorem 1.1.5 of [3] on p. 12 we have

ψ0(x2) =

η(x)ψ0(x) = G(η, ψ0).

where ψ(cid:48) is a nontrivial additive character of kF and η is the quadratic character of k×

Therefore we can conclude that G(c) is a fourth root of unity.

Furthermore, since G(c) · q

F = G(η, ψ(cid:48)) is a quadratic classical Gauss sum, from the
computation of λK/F , where K/F is a tamely ramiﬁed quadratic extension (cf. Subsection
3.4.1 ), we can conclude that G(c) is actually a λ-function for some quadratic tamely ramiﬁed
local extension.
