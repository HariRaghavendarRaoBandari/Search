Abstract—A dielectric elastomer generator (DEG) can be used
for converting mechanical energy from natural motion sources
such as walking, waves, trees etc, into electrical energy. A DEG
is comprised of a soft and ﬂexible Dielectric Elastomer capacitor
(DE), a Priming Circuit (PC), which transfers high potential
charge onto/off
the DE electrodes, and a power extraction
circuit which harvests the generated power. To generate power,
the PC must charge and discharge the DE in synchronization
with the DE’s capacitance change. A simple circuit to do this
exists: the self-priming circuit (SPC). The SPC consists of diodes
and capacitors which passively switch between charge delivery
and charge receiving states in synchronization with the DE’s
capacitance change. Until now there has been no understanding
of how to design a SPC in order to maximize harvested energy
from the dielectric elastomer (DE). A new mathematical model
for a SPC is presented, leading to design and optimization. An
accuracy of 0.1% between model, simulation and experiment is
obtained once losses are taken into consideration. The behavior
of the SPC is shown to be related to the maximum and minimum
capacitance’s of the DE, but is largley unaffected by the exact
capacitance waveform.

I. INTRO

Dielectric elastomer (DE) devices are multi-functional and
can be used as sensors, actuators and energy harvesters [1],
[2]. Fundamentally, a DE device consists of one or more
ﬂexible elastomer capacitors coupled to dedicated high po-
tential charge source. DE sensors work through the electronic
sensing of capacitance change associated with stretch and/or
pressure [3]. Actuation is achieved with controlled placement
of high potential charge on or off the stretchable surface
electrodes. This static charge results in in-plane expansion
and out-of-plane contraction under the inﬂuence of Maxwell
stresses, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). Such ‘artiﬁcial muscle’
actuators are a better match to natural muscle than other
actuator technologies [4], [5]. Harvesting energy, essentially
the opposite to actuation, involves using mechanical deforma-
tion of the DE membrane to do work on electric charge [6],
[7]. Operationally, a DE membrane is mechanically stretched
or subjected to pressure, during this time electronics places
charge on the membrane. Relaxation of the membrane results
in work being done on the electric charge as like charges are
crowded together while unlike charges on opposing surfaces
are pushed further apart. Electronics are then used for har-
vesting the high potential charge. This combination of DE
with electronics comprises the Dielectric Elastomer Generator
(DEG). The basic mechanical/charge DEG cycle is depicted
in Fig. 1(b). Successful operation requires charge management
that
is synchronized with the mechanical deformation of
the DE. Therefore, the operational principle of a DEG is

considerably more complex than other generator technologies
such as piezoelectrics and electromagnetic induction [1], [8].

The efﬁciency of the mechanical to electrical conversion
improves as more charge is placed on the surfaces of the
elastomer membranes. To achieve adequate energy density
and good efﬁciency, DEG’s are typically operated at electrical
potentials in the kilo-volt range. Energy gathered at this high
potential must be converted down to a lower potential for use
or storage. Both conversion and charge management are best
achieved with bi-directional electronic converters, capable of
transferring charge from low potentials to high potentials with
good efﬁciency [9], [10], [11], [12]. Such converters typically
have power losses associated with conversion and manage-
ment. This need not be a problem for high power systems
such as those utilizing wind and wave energy [13], [14]. In
comparison, for small portable and potentially wearable DEGs
which support low power electronic devices, these losses can
be in excess of what can be generated [8]. One possible
solution to overcome losses in small DEGs is the addition of an
electret to the DE setup. Electrets are solid dielectric materials
with quasi-permanent electric charge [15]. The electret is used
as an electrostatic source to polarize the DEG, removing the
need for an external high potential charge source. Due to the
rigid nature of electrets, direct integration into the DEG is not
possible. Hybrid DE-electret generators have been developed
using corrugated electrets which restrict generator motion to

The self-priming circuit (SPC) developed in [18], [19]
provides an effective solution for low power DEGs. The SPC
does not require additional power for control as it consists
of diodes and capacitors arranged in branches. The number
of branches present is referred to as the order of the circuit
n. The SPC is connected in parallel
to the DE and can
passively boost the DE voltage from a low potential to the
kilovolt range over a number of cycles. Once the potential
reaches the working kilovolt level, packets of high potential
charge can be used by an external circuit or converted to low
voltage with a buck converter for immediate use or storage.
In 2010, [20] proposed a mathematical model for a ﬁrst order
SPC. In such a system, DE capacitance must typically double
for the SPC to function. To reduce the required capacitance
swing, a higher order SPC is required. It is not clear how to
choose the optimum value of SPC parameters to match the
DE and maximize the harvested energy. In order to better
understand the interaction between SPC and DE, a more
general mathematical model is needed. This paper presents
a comprehensive mathematical model for an SPC with any
possible value of circuit parameters. The model can be used
as a design tool to optimize the voltage boosting performance
of the DEG. The model allows external electronics to predict
DEG voltage and react as neccesary, enabling the DEG to
operate near dielectric break down. Experimental results from
prototype SPC’s have been compared to model and simulation,
showing the veracity of model.

II. THE SELF PRIMING CIRCUIT

A typical DEG system is depicted in Fig. 2 and consists of
dedicated priming, charge extraction and control circuitry. The
self priming circuit allows the removal of priming circuitry and
portion of the control circuitry, replacing the outlined area.

Fig. 2: Block Diagram of a typical DEG

A ﬁrst order SPC is shown in Fig. 3(a). If the capacitors
Ca1 and Cb1 are of equal value, charge will be shared evenly
during circuit operation, resulting in the best performance.
Higher order SPC are realized by paralleling and modifying
the ﬁrst order circuit as depicted in the second order SPC in
Fig. 3b.. For circuits higher than ﬁrst order, capacitors values
are referenced to the highest capacitance present in the circuit,
C. For the second order SPC, the capacitors should have the
2 .
following values: Ca1 = Cb1 = C and Ca2 = Cb2 = C

Higher order SPC can be implemented using the general
nth order circuit shown in Fig. 4. In this form, the capacitance
values are given by Cax = Cbx = C

III. MATHEMATICAL MODEL

In order to derive a general expression for any SPC, the
second order SPC in Fig. 3b will be analyzed in as broad a
sense as possible. A SPC switches between two conﬁgurations
where its capacitors are essentially in parallel (low voltage)
and delivering charge to the stretched DE, or in series (high
voltage) for receipt of charge from the relaxed DE. This
conﬁguration is determined by the voltage V across the top
rail.

The series conﬁguration is depicted in Fig. 5. This situation
occurs when the voltage V is higher than any individual
capacitor voltage, which causes the diodes D2 and D4 to
conduct. This results in capacitors adding in series summing to
3 . It can be shown that for any order of SPC, the equivalent
2C
series capacitance C ser is given by:

Cser =

nC
n + 1

(1)

Fig. 5: 2nd order SPC in series conﬁguration

The parallel conﬁguration is depicted in Fig. 6. This sit-
uation occurs when the voltage V across the circuit is lower
than any individual capacitor’s voltage causing diodes D1, D3
and D5 to conduct. This arranges the capacitors in a parallel
conﬁguration with Ca1and Cb1 adding in series before ﬁnally
2 . It can be shown that for any order of SPC,
summing to 3C
the equivalent parallel capacitance C par is given by:

in an inversely proportional manner as depicted in Fig. 9.

A. Initial Priming T = t0

For this derivation, the chosen DE capacitance change is the
sinusoid depicted in Fig. 7. In reality any periodic waveform
with the same maximum capacitance (Cmax) and minimum
capacitance (C0) will result in an identical outcome. In order to
perform analysis, charge, voltage and capacitance at each time
interval from t0 to t4 are evaluated. To simplify the derivation,
diode and leakage losses will be ignored.

Fig. 9: Waveforms at time t1

Once the DE voltage has reached the same potential as the
SPC’s parallel conﬁguration, the parallel diodes D1,3,5 will
become forward biased and the circuit switches to the parallel
conﬁguration shown in Fig. 10. Current now ﬂows from the
SPC capacitors into the DE.

Fig. 7: DE capacitance change

Fig. 10: Circuit at time t1

Initially all capacitors are discharged, the circuit is con-
nected in parallel to the DE. The DE is uncompressed and is
at minimum capacitance C0. A voltage source of magnitude
V0 is connected to the circuit and current ﬂows into the DEG,
charging the capacitors in the series through D2 and D4 as
depicted in Fig. 8. After the capacitors and DE are charged,
the voltage source is removed and the circuit appears as C0
and C ser in parallel, charged to V0. At this point the charge
on the DE, QDE0 is given by:

QDE0 = V0C0

(3)

The voltage V1 at which this toggling occurs depends on
the SPC order. Increasing the order of the SPC results in a
higher toggling voltage. V1 can be calculated from the SPC
order n and the initial priming voltage V0:

V1 =

nV0

(n + 1)

(4)

No charge has ﬂowed anywhere in the system yet, thus the
DE charge is the same as it was at t0. The SPC charge must be
calculated from V1 and Cpar in order to determine the overall
system charge Q1:

Q1 = QDE1 + QSPC1 = V0C0 + V1Cpar

using (2) and (4) yields:

The circuit now transitions from t0 to t1. During this time,
the DE and SPC are disconnected as all diodes are reverse

C. Diodes stop conducting Cmax is reached T = t2

During the transition from t1 to t2, current continues to
ﬂow from the SPC into the DE. This results in the lower
VDE gradient seen in Fig. 11. At time t2 the DE has reached
its maximum value of capacitance, thus the circuit reaches
its lowest possible voltage. Diodes now stop conduction and
current ﬂow ceases.

At time t3, the DE voltage matches the voltage of the SPC in
the series conﬁguration allowing the series diodes to conduct.
This allows current to ﬂow from the DE into the SPC as
illustrated in Fig. 14. The voltage V3 where this occurs can be
calculated from the SPC order and previous voltage V2

E. Diodes End Conduction, C0 is reached T = t4

During the transition from t3 to t4, current ﬂows from the
DE into the SPC. The VDE gradient is lower during this time
as illustrated in Fig. 15.

Fig. 12: Circuit at time t2

At t2 the charge on the DE has increased. This charge,

QDE2 is given by:

QDE2 = CmaxV2

(7)

D. Toggling to series conﬁguration T = t3

During the transition from t2 to t3, the capacitance of the
DE reduces causing the proportional rise in voltage seen in
Fig. 13.

Fig. 15: Waveforms at time t4

At time t4, the DE has returned to its minimum value of
capacitance C0. This is a complete cycle. Current stops ﬂowing
and the diodes end conduction. The SPC and DE disconnect
as illustrated in Figure 16. The ﬁnal voltage after one cycle
V4 can be calculated from the system charge in the previous
state, Q3 and the ﬁnal system capacitance.

resulting in a different voltage waveform with identical peaks
and troughs. Multiple tests were performed with the same DE
which had a minimum capacitance of 45 nF. The capacitance
swing λ2 and the SPC capacitance C were varied and the
results recorded. For simplicity a compression frequency of
1 Hz was chosen for all experiments.

Fig. 16: Circuit at time t4

It is common to replace the maximum capacitance Cmax
with the ratio of capacitance change, λ2 which is directly
related to the strain on the DE (λ2 = λxλy):

Cmax = λ2C0
Substituting back into (10) yields:

V4 =

[nλ2C0 + C(n + 1)] [C0(n + 1) + nC]

At this point, an expression for the voltage on the system
after k cycles can be introduced. This shall be described as
V (k) where k is any positive integer. This results in equation

an arbitrary number of cycles.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

A. Losses

A prototype system was built and tested with a pneumatic
compression rig which compressed a DE by a ﬁxed amount
repeatably. An image of the experimental setup can be seen in
Fig. 17a. The setup monitors both displacement and force with
a laser sensor and load cell. End caps are attached to the DE
which are needed to improve compression homogeneity [21],
[22], [23]. The actuator was controlled with labview. Due to
the nature of the compression rig’s controller, achieving the
sinusoidal capacitance waveform used in the model was not
possible. Instead, the saw-tooth waveform seen in Fig. 17b
was used. Each experiment was simulated in Spice with a sinu-
soidal capacitance change. As will be shown, the mathematical
formula derived in (13) is waveform independent. The exact
time where diode toggling occurs will differ from simulation,

The system voltage for 5 complete cycles with n = 2,
λ2 = 2 and C = 60 nF is shown in Fig. 18. This shows
that Spice and the mathematical model are identical. The
experimental results match for a cycle, then errors compound
and the voltage deviates from theory and simulation. We
account for this error due to losses in the system from: system
leakage, diode losses and tolerance differences between the
SPC capacitance’s. In order to match experimental data to the
mathematical and Spice models, a simple leakage model is
added. In Spice simulation, this is achieved with a resistor in
parallel with the system. In the mathematical model, losses are
added by reducing maximum and minimum voltages reached
as a function of voltage and leakage resistance.

Since the models accuracy has been proved experimentally,
it became prudent
to determine circuit parameters which
will allow maximum voltage gain per cycle. In order to do
this, the ﬁnal voltage with respect to initial voltage must
be differentiated. First, the maximum voltage gain G , with
respect to SPC capacitance C will be derived. To do this,
normalize V4 using V0 :

(15)

In order to determine the amount of leakage present, a dis-
charge test was performed on the entire system. By considering
two points on the discharge curve shown in Fig. 19, it is
possible to estimate the leakage resistance using (14):

C is pulled out as a common factor and then differentiated:

C2(n2 + n) + C[n2λ2C0 + C0(n + 1)2] + λ2C2
0 (n2 + n)

dC = 0

to ﬁnd the maximum set dG
it can be shown that:
0 = C 2[nC0 + C0 − nλ2C0] + C 3
solving for C yields:

0 [nλ4 − nλ2 − λ2]

B. Results

After adding the resistance model in (14), the error between
experimental and theory was greatly reduced. Fig. 20 shows
the same experiment data as Fig. 18 with corrected Spice and
mathematical models. The time and amplitude of the peaks
are now in good agreement.

Fig. 20: 2nd Order SPC with leakage modelled

The optimum order can be calculated in the same manner

and was found to be:

n =

1 + √λ2
λ2 − 1

(17)

Due to requirement that the order must be an integer, it is
beneﬁcial to rather take an approach where n is selected, and
the range of λ2 for which n is optimum can be calculated.
If the optimum n is chosen, it must satisfy the condition that
the gain is greater than or equal to that of the previous and
subsequent orders, yielding:

G(nopt − 1) ≤ G(nopt) ≥ G(nopt + 1)

(18)

substituting (15) into (18) it can be shown that for a given
n the range of swing for which n is an optimum is given by:

n + 2
n ≤ λ2 ≤

n + 1
n − 1

(19)

Equation (19) can be used to produce Table I which shows

the optimum SPC order for varying values of swing.

C. Validation of voltage boosting

In order to validate the optimum capacitance value for
voltage boosting, ﬁve second order self priming circuits with
varying values of C were built. The SPC’s had values 20 nF,
60 nF, 66 nF, 185 nF, 785 nF. These were each tested for 20
cycles with an identical DE and compression setup. A λ2 of
2 and CDE of 45 nF was chosen for this test. The data was
analyzed and the average voltage gain per cycle, V (k+1)
, was
V (k)
calculated. In a lossless system the optimum value of C could
be calculated using equation (16). As is shown in Fig. 21, the
lossless mathematical model overestimates the voltage gain of
the SPC. The lossless model predicts the optimum value of C
to be 63.63 nF. After adding the loss model discussed above,
experimental and mathematical follow a similar contour. The
vertical dashed lines in Fig. 21, indicate the location of the
mathematical maximums. As is evident, the addition of loss
to the model has shifted the optimum value of capacitance to a
higher value. This essentially indicates that an increased SPC
size acts to diminish the system leakage which is expected
as the SPC capacitors have better leakage characteristics than
DEs.

Fig. 21: Voltage Gain versus SPC Capacitance

VI. DISCUSSION

The model is subject to the following assumptions:
• Leakage is constant - Due to the combination of high
voltage and the complex interaction between SPC and
DE, a simple voltage based leakage model does not
adequately reﬂect the actual leakage.

• Capacitors are ideal - Tolerances between SPC capacitors
causes non ideal switching (premature or delayed). An

7

SPC simulation could look at statistical variation to
provide a conﬁdence interval on losses due to tolerances.
• Diodes have ideal/constant characteristics - Diodes have
reverse leakage and forward voltage drops, all of which
may vary. An advanced diode loss model would be built
into a future model.

• Electrode resistance of the DE is negligible - As is well
known, DE electrode resistance can be relatively high and
strain dependent [24]. The model assumes no electrode
resistance, losses arising from electrode resistance are
proportional to the electrode resistance. As a result, unless
electrode resistance is in the mega ohm range, it can be
ignored.

We have introduced and tested a model for predicting the
energy ﬂow between a DE and its SPC. The SPC is a passive
charge control circuit that is ideally suited for low power
and portable applications. Unlike active electronic solutions,
the SPC doesn’t require external power for switching and
uses only diodes and capacitors. Due to the voltage boosting
nature of the SPC, initial priming charge can come from low
voltage sources like solar cells or batteries. The SPC does not
compromise the ﬂexibility of the DE since it is an external
circuit. The SPC is characterized by a capacitor bank that
switches between series and parallel conﬁgurations. The model
has shown that the circuit performs best with respect to voltage
boosting when capacitance’s are chosen using (16). There is
also an optimum order of the circuit for voltage boosting
which can be chosen from (19). The optimum order is not
immediately apparent for the following reason: The SPC will
n . If a arbitrary
not function when the swing, λ2 is less than n+1
value of λ2 is assumed, the obvious guess for optimum order
is the closest order that will allow the circuit to function.
The actual optimum order is generally much higher than
the minimum functioning order. The model has been tested
and validated using Spice simulation and experimentally. The
change in capacitance for Spice simulation assumed a sinusoid
and the experiment was a saw-tooth. Despite these differences
in waveform, the agreement in ﬁnal voltages was very good.
SPCs up to 6th order were validated in simulation with
perfect agreement. SPCs up to third order were validated
experimentally with an average error of 0.1%.

VII. CONCLUSION

A model for an SPC with any value of circuit parameters
has been proposed and tested. It allows prediction of the
DEG voltage after every cycle and has been validated in
simulation and experimentally. The model allows optimization
of the circuit for voltage boosting in terms of SPC capacitance
and order. The optimums were found to depend on DE
capacitance and swing. With optimum voltage boosting per
cycle it is possible to boost voltage rapidly to working levels
for harvesting. This would enable low voltage startup and
eliminates the need for an external high voltage source. The
sources of loss in the system have been discussed and a simple
model for loss developed. Future work would involve a more
complex loss model. The passive charge control provided by
the SPC makes it ideal for low power situations where active
charge control solutions are impractical.
