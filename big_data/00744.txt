ABSTRACT

We report on the timing and spectral analysis of two Suzaku observations with diﬀerent ﬂux levels of the high-mass X-ray binary
KS 1947+300 during its 2013 outburst. In agreement with simultaneous NuSTAR observations, the continuum is well described by
an absorbed power law with a cut-oﬀ and an additional black body component. In addition we ﬁnd ﬂuorescent emission from neutral,
He-like, and even H-like iron. We determine a pulse period of ∼18.8 s with the source showing a spin-up between the two observations.
Both Suzaku observations show a very similar behavior of the pulse proﬁle, which is strongly energy dependent, with an evolution
from a proﬁle with one peak at low energies to a proﬁle with two peaks of diﬀerent widths towards higher energies seen in both, the
Suzaku and NuSTAR data. Such an evolution to a more complex proﬁle at higher energies is rarely seen in X-ray pulsars, most cases
show the opposite behavior. Pulse phase-resolved spectral analysis shows a variation in the absorbing column density, NH, over pulse
phase. Spectra taken during the pulse proﬁle minima are intrinsically softer compared to the pulse phase-averaged spectrum.

1. Introduction
KS 1947+300 is an accretion powered X-ray pulsar in the con-
stellation Cygnus. It was discovered on 1989 June 8 by the TTM
instrument on the Kvant module of the Mir space station at a
ﬂux level of 70 ± 10 mCrab in the 2–27 keV band (Borozdin
et al. 1990). Its energy spectrum can be described by an absorbed
power law of photon index 1.72 ± 0.31 and an equivalent hydro-
gen column density of (3.4 ± 3.0) × 1022 cm−2.

In 1994, this source was rediscovered as GRO J1948+32 by
the Burst and Transient Science Experiment on the Compton
Gamma-Ray Observatory. It was identiﬁed as an X-ray pulsar
with a pulse period of ∼18.7 s. This observation also allowed
for a ﬁrst estimate of the orbital parameters (Chakrabarty et al.
1995). Further RXTE observations of an outburst in 2000–2001
proved that KS 1947+300 and GRO J1948+32 are the same ob-
ject (Levine & Corbet 2000; Swank & Morgan 2000). Its orbit
was found to have an eccentricity e = 0.033 ± 0.013, an or-
bital period Porb = 40.415 ± 0.010 d, and a semi-major axis of
a sin i = 137.4 lt-s (Galloway et al. 2004). The optical compan-
ion was identiﬁed as a B0Ve star (Negueruela et al. 2003).

Naik et al. (2006) presented a broad band spectral analysis
using three BeppoSAX observations of the 2000 November–
2001 June outburst. Their spectral model consisted of a
Comptonized continuum, a black body component with a tem-
perature of ∼0.6 keV, and an iron emission line at 6.7 keV.
Tsygankov & Lutovinov (2005) reported on INTEGRAL obser-
vations taken from 2002 December to 2004 April and presented
studies on the evolution of the pulse proﬁle and period. They

found a proportionality of the pulsation frequency and ﬂux near
the peak of the outburst, although at low signiﬁcance, and they
also observed a ﬂux dependence of the pulse proﬁle shape.

In this paper we report on the analysis of two Suzaku ob-
servations from 2013 October and 2013 November taken dur-
ing the ﬁrst outburst of this source since 2004. These obser-
vations were quasi simultaneous to NuSTAR observations in
which F¨urst et al. (2014) present evidence for the presence of a
Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature (CRSF or cyclotron line)
at 12.2 keV. The detection of CRSFs allows us to directly infer
the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the emission region, which is a
fundamental parameter of the neutron star (see, e.g., Harding &
Lai 2006, for a review). Suzaku provides high sensitivity at low
energies and therefore allows us to study the soft component of
the broad band continuum, which is not available from NuSTAR
alone, including the absorption and iron ﬂuorescence emission.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an
overview of the data acquisition and reduction. In Sect. 3, we
investigate the shape, energy dependence, and evolution of the
pulse proﬁles. Phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectral anal-
yses are presented in Sect. 4 and 5, respectively. In Sect. 6, we
summarize and discuss our results.

2. Observation and Data Reduction
2.1. Suzaku
Suzaku is a joint mission of JAXA and NASA. It carries
two main detectors: The X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS;

1

Ballhausen et al.: Suzaku observations of the 2013 outburst of KS 1947+300

Takahashi et al. 2007) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD;
Koyama et al. 2007). XIS consists of four individual but identical
Type-I Wolter telescopes (XRT), focusing the X-rays on CCD
cameras. The XIS1 camera is back-illuminated, providing higher
sensitivity at lower energies than the other front-illuminated con-
ﬁgurations with a maximum energy range of 0.2–12 keV for all
XIS (Takahashi et al. 2007). In 2006, XIS2 was damaged by
a micro-meteorite impact and became unusable. HXD consists
of a collimated PIN silicon diode array (PIN) and a GSO/BGO
phoswitch counter (GSO), covering a total energy range of 10–
600 keV (Koyama et al. 2007).

Suzaku observed the 2013 outburst of KS 1947+300 twice,
approximately one month apart and partially coinciding with
NuSTAR observations. The observation log is summarized
in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the Swift /BAT lightcurve of
KS 1947+300 (Krimm et al. 2013) with times of the Suzaku
observations marked. During both observations, XIS was oper-
ated in 1/4 Window mode and Clocking modes were set to “nor-
mal” and “burst” for the ﬁrst (Obs. I) and second observations
(Obs. II), respectively.

We used the software package HEAsoft (v. 6.15.1) for all
Suzaku reprocessing and extraction. Standard screening criteria
and calibration were applied by running aepipeline on both
datasets. All event times were transferred to the solar barycen-
ter using aebarycen. We used Suzaku CALDB v20110630 for
XRT, v20110913 for HXD, and v20130916 and v20131231 for
the ﬁrst and second XIS data set, respectively.

Most likely due to incorrect attitude determination, the con-
version of XIS detector to sky coordinates yields incorrect val-
ues for the ﬁrst observation. As a result the sky image can not
be properly reconstructed and shows two distinct sources. We
therefore performed all data extractions for this observation in
detector coordinates and regions are given in units of pixels. This
method does not allow an additional attitude correction with the
FTOOL aeattcor2 (see Uchiyama et al. 2008, for details). As
the variation of the eﬀective area with oﬀ axis angle is small, the
systematic error introduced by this choice is small and does not
aﬀect our analysis.

For the second observation aeattcor2 was used for further
improvement of the spacecraft’s attitude. We used annular ex-
traction regions for XIS with outer radii of 125 pixels (Obs. I)
and 1.(cid:48)5 (Obs. II). Inner radii were set individually to exclude
all regions with pile-up fractions larger than 4% (65–72 pixels
for Obs. I and 35(cid:48)(cid:48) for Obs. II), which were estimated using
pileest. The XIS lightcurves were extracted with a 2 s time
resolution, which is the highest possible resolution for the se-
lected operating modes.

We applied the PIN response for calibration epoch 11 for the
XIS nominal pointing position. We used the PIN “tuned” back-
ground (v2.2) as the non X-ray background model (Fukazawa
et al. 2009) for all analyses and also took the cosmic X-ray back-
ground into account (Boldt 1987). We applied the GSO “correc-
tion ARF”, provided by the Suzaku HXD team to improve the
calibration of this instrument (see Yamada et al. 2011, for de-
tails) to both observations. PIN has a nominal time resolution
of 61 µs. Because the good time intervals corresponding to the
phase bins are too short for an individual correction, the overall
loss of artiﬁcially triggered “pseudo” events was used to estimate
the dead time for the pulse proﬁles.

We extracted lightcurves and spectra for all avail-
able Suzaku instruments using xselect for the XIS, and
the Suzaku speciﬁc FTOOLs hxdpinxbpi/hxdpinxblc and
hxdgsoxbpi/hxdgsoxblc for the extraction of the PIN and the
GSO data, respectively.

In order to avoid well known uncertainties in the eﬀective
area and response matrix determination, we considered only
the energy range of 1–10 keV for XIS0 and XIS3 and 1–8 keV
for XIS1 for the spectral analysis. The energy ranges of 1.72–
1.88 keV and 2.19–2.37 keV were excluded for all XIS due to
known Au and Si calibration features (Nowak et al. 2011).
For PIN and GSO we used the energy ranges of 15–70 keV
and 70–90 keV, respectively. We used the Interactive Spectral
Interpretation System (ISIS v1.6.2, Houck & Denicola 2000).
Uncertainties are given at the 90% conﬁdence level (CL) for one
parameter of interest unless otherwise noted.

2.2. NuSTAR

As mentioned above, simultaneous to our Suzaku observations
there were also two NuSTAR observations which have previ-
ously been published by F¨urst et al. (2014). We use these data to
better illustrate the interpretation of the pulse proﬁle evolution
with energy than what is possible with Suzaku alone (Sect. 3).
We extracted the NuSTAR data from ObsID 80002015004 us-
ing the standard pipeline nupipline v. 1.4.1 as distributed with
HEAsoft v. 6.16 and CALDB v. 20150316. We used the same
extraction regions as F¨urst et al. (2014), i.e., radii of 130(cid:48)(cid:48) and
105(cid:48)(cid:48), for the source and background, respectively. Light curves
were extracted with 0.5 s time-resolution. This time resolution is
nominally faster than the available dead time calculation, which
is only available on a 1 s basis. However, KS 1947+300 is vary-
ing smoothly on these timescales so that averaging over 1 s bins
for the dead time does not introduce signiﬁcant errors in the

viously determined pulse proﬁles with additional Poisson noise.
Epoch folding was then applied to a large number (in our case
10 000) of simulated lightcurves. The standard deviation of the
pulse periods obtained with this simulation was taken as uncer-
tainty of the pulse period of the data. All Suzaku detectors are
in very good agreement with each other, but we quote the value
of PIN, since it has the highest time resolution. The measured
pulse periods are 18.80876(7) s and 18.78896(7) s for Obs. I and
Obs. II, respectively. Thus, the source showed spin-up between
the observations as was also observed by F¨urst et al. (2014). We
note, however, that the lightcurves have not been corrected for
binary motion because of an accumulation of the uncertainties of
the orbital parameters since 2000/2001. We estimated the possi-
ble impact of binary motion on the determined spin-up by cor-
recting the photon arrival times using the orbital parameters of
Galloway et al. (2004). We found that, even assuming that the
phase information is lost completely, binary motion can only ac-
count for ∼30% of the observed pulse period change. We there-
fore conclude that the observed spin-up is at least partly caused
by the transfer of angular momentum to the neutron star.

The shape and evolution of the pulse proﬁle look very sim-
ilar for both observations and are therefore shown only for the
ﬁrst observation in Fig. 3. The pulse proﬁles in the XIS and PIN
are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other. The soft pulse pro-
ﬁle consists of only one broad peak, whereas the hard proﬁle is
more complex and consists of a narrow peak and a broad peak at
higher energies. This characteristic evolution of the pulse proﬁle
with energy has already been observed during previous outbursts
(see, e.g., Tsygankov & Lutovinov 2005; Naik et al. 2006).

Using the Suzaku data alone, however, the analysis of evo-
lution of the pulse proﬁle at low energies is limited by the 2 s
time resolution of the XIS. We took advantage of the excellent
time resolution of NuSTAR to investigate the pulse proﬁle evo-
lution also at soft energies in more detail. We determined the
local pulse period of the NuSTAR data to be 18.78779 s. We
extracted light curves in 40 energy bins between 3–50 keV and
folded them on this pulse period using 60 phase bins. Figure 4
shows the resulting count rate distribution of NuSTAR as a func-
tion of energy and pulse phase. To account for the high-energy
roll-over of the spectrum of the pulsar, all pulse proﬁles were

count rate estimate. The extracted lightcurves were barycentered
to the solar system.

3. Timing analysis
The lightcurves of both Suzaku observations show no sign of
ﬂaring or signiﬁcant variability and therefore indicate that time
resolved spectroscopy is not necessary. The absolute variability
amplitude in the lightcurve is higher in Obs. II, but the relative
variability is similar. We note that the hardness ratio was roughly
the same in both observations (see Fig. 2).

Pulse periods were determined for both observations using
the epoch folding technique (Leahy et al. 1983): Pulse proﬁles
are calculated for a series of test periods, assuming that for the
correct period the corresponding pulse proﬁle shows the most
distinct shape, whereas for any other test period the averaging
over a large number of pulses leads to a smoothing of the result-
ing proﬁle. We did not use GSO for the pulse period determina-
tion because of its low statistics. Uncertainties of the pulse peri-
ods were estimated by simulating lightcurves based on the pre-

normalized to their mean count rate and are given in units of
their standard deviation. The pulse map shows that the secondary
peak starts to form at ∼6 keV and is of comparable strength
to the main peak above ∼15 keV. Interestingly, we do not ﬁnd
any signiﬁcant phase shifts around the cyclotron line energy as
predicted by theory (Sch¨onherr et al. 2014) and as observed in
4U 0115+634 by Ferrigno et al. (2011).

4. Phase-averaged spectroscopy
We now turn to a description of the X-ray spectrum of the source
in both observations. For the ﬁrst observation, the XIS spec-
tra were jointly re-binned to a minimum signal to noise ratio
(S/N) of 80, except for the energy range of 6–7 keV, which was
re-binned to a minimum S/N of 65 to ensure higher resolution
in the iron line region. The intrinsic energy resolution of XIS,
which is around 190 eV FWHM at ∼6 keV (Ozawa et al. 2009),
is oversampled by a factor of 4–5 in the iron line region. The
PIN spectrum was re-binned to a minimum S/N of 25 and for
GSO a channel binning factor of three was applied. For the sec-
ond observation we chose a minimum S/N of 70 for XIS (50 for
6–7 keV) to account for the shorter exposure time but re-binned
PIN and GSO with the requirements of the ﬁrst observation.

Figure 5 shows the phase-averaged spectrum with the best-ﬁt
model for the second observation and the best ﬁt parameters for
both observations are given in Table 2.

The best ﬁtting continuum model is an absorbed power law

with an exponential cut-oﬀ of the form

CutoffPL(E) ∝ E−Γ exp(−E/Efold) ,

(1)

as used in ISIS/XSPEC with the photon index Γ and the folding
energy Efold. An additional black body component with tempera-
ture kTBB was required to describe the spectrum below ∼10 keV.
Following F¨urst et al. (2014), we used an updated version of the
absorption model tbabs1, called tbnew with abundances and
cross sections set according to Wilms et al. (2000) and Verner
et al. (1996), respectively.

Tsujimoto et al. (2011) systematically investigated the cross-
calibration of the individual XIS and reported that spectra ob-
served with XIS1 tend to be slightly softer compared to XIS0
and XIS3. We therefore ﬁtted the photon index of the back-
illuminated XIS1 separately from the other XIS and HXD.
The normalization and folding energy were required to be the
same for all detectors during the ﬁt. We conﬁrm the result of
Tsujimoto et al. (2011) that the photon index obtained from
XIS1 is slightly higher compared to the other XIS and HXD,
which agree with each other to within the conﬁdence levels. Note
that due to the lower signal to noise ratio of the phase-resolved
spectra this deviation of XIS1 and the other XIS’ can be ignored
in the phase-resolved analysis.

Figure 6 shows the Fe line region of the spectrum for Obs. I
and residuals for including diﬀerent model components. For both
observations, the Fe Kα and Kβ lines were modelled by two
Gaussian emission lines. Furthermore, we ﬁxed all line widths
to 10−6 keV, assuming that line broadening is only due to the de-
tector response. The Fe Kβ line is not signiﬁcantly detected, i.e.,
adding it does not signiﬁcantly improve the ﬁt quality. However,
if the line is due to ﬂuorescence, then Fe Kβ emission has to be
present at a known ﬂux level and energy. We therefore included
such a line at 0.65 keV higher than the Fe Kα line energy with
a ﬂux of 13% of the Kα line to the model (Palmeri et al. 2003).

Note that this did not introduce further ﬁt parameters. Adding
the Kα and Kβ line of neutral iron to our ﬁnal continuum model
reduced the χ2/d.o.f from 1178.11/718 to 1016.06/716 for Obs I.
and from 878.14/565 to 790.95/563 for Obs. II. It was further-
more necessary to add a third emission line at ∼6.7 keV, the
Kα line energy of He-like iron. Including this component again
led to an improvement of χ2/d.o.f to 906.22/714 for Obs. I and
741.03/561 for Obs. II. For the ﬁrst observation, a fourth narrow
emission line at ∼6.9 keV, the Kα line energy of H-like iron, was
also required, reducing the χ2/d.o.f further to 893.53/712. This
feature was not signiﬁcantly detected in the second observation,
possibly because of the lower exposure. The upper limit for the
ﬂux of this feature, however, is consistent with that measured
during the ﬁrst observation. We determined the signiﬁcance of
the H-like iron line with a Monte-Carlo approach (see, e.g.,
Protassov et al. 2002) and obtained a signiﬁcance of 99.993%
with 105 trials. For all other iron lines we found a signiﬁcance
of greater than 99.999%. Including a systematic uncertainty of
1.3% slightly reduces the detection signiﬁcance of the H-like
iron line to 99.978%. The other lines are not aﬀected.

As mentioned above, F¨urst et al. (2014) discovered a cy-
clotron line at 12.2 keV in the NuSTAR data. Unfortunately, this
is exactly in the gap between the XIS and the HXD spectra. Since
the line is rather wide, however, it can in principle still inﬂuence
the Suzaku analysis. We therefore applied the continuum model

a second harmonic, which we would expect around 24 keV, al-
though PIN and NuSTAR are both very sensitive in this energy
range. We determined the upper limits for the optical depth of a
second harmonic at 24.4 keV assuming a width of 2.5 keV and
ﬁnd dCRSF ≤ 0.05 for Obs. I and dCRSF ≤ 0.11 for Obs. II. Using
the NuSTAR spectrum with exactly the same binning and energy
range restriction criteria as described by F¨urst et al. (2014) we
obtained dCRSF ≤ 0.10. There are, however, also other examples
where harmonic lines have not yet been detected (e.g., Cen X-3
or RX J0520.5−6932, Suchy et al. 2008; Tendulkar et al. 2014,
respectively) although their energies are in principle accessible
with current instruments.

The best ﬁt parameters are given in Table 2 and Fig. 5 shows
the phase-averaged spectrum and best-ﬁt model of the second
observation.

The reduced χ2 values of our best ﬁts are still somewhat
larger than 1. We ascribe this to calibration uncertainties and po-
tentially minor shortcomings of the source modeling. We tried
adding a systematic error in quadrature to the data and found an
assumed systematic error of 1.3% to result in reduced χ2 val-
ues of 0.93 for Obs. I and 1.06 for Obs. II for the same degrees
of freedom as given in Table 2. However, the choice of the sys-
tematic uncertainty is rather arbitrary and not explicitly recom-
mended by any dedicated calibration studies. We therefore do
not include a systematic uncertainty in our analysis.

We note a strong diﬀerence for the XIS detector normaliza-
tion constants between both observations. We attribute this dif-
ference to the diﬀerent data extraction modes and the lacking
attitude correction for the ﬁrst observation, as the simulation of
the eﬀective area of XIS, which is performed by the FTOOL
xissimarfgen in the course of data reduction, is highly sensi-
tive to the source position and extent. Possible deviations of the

with the line energy ECRSF, the width σCRSF, and the depth dCRSF.
As the Suzaku instruments do not cover the cyclotron line
centroid energy, not all three parameters can be constrained si-
multaneously. We ﬁxed the line energy and width to the values
from F¨urst et al. (2014) and only ﬁtted the line strength. Fits that
include the CRSF describe the data better, especially for Obs. II.
In fact, F¨urst et al. (2014) found the CRSF to be most promi-
nent in the NuSTAR observation which overlaps with the sec-
ond Suzaku observation. Ignoring the CRSF leads to negative
residuals near 15 keV (see Fig. 5b and d for Obs. II). We cau-
tion that this is by no means a detection or a conﬁrmation of a
CRSF in the Suzaku data. However, there is a qualitative agree-
ment of the Suzaku data and the results by F¨urst et al. (2014)
regarding the CRSF. Although observed in a number of other
sources (e.g., 4U 0115+634 or V 0332+53, Heindl et al. 1999;
Pottschmidt et al. 2005, respectively), we ﬁnd no indications of

5. Phase-resolved spectroscopy
In order to study the variation of the continuum with the viewing
angle onto the neutron star, we extracted spectra for ﬁve individ-
ual pulse phase intervals (Phase bin [Pb] 1–5, see Fig. 3 for the
deﬁnition of the phase intervals). The width and location of the
phase intervals were chosen to ensure suﬃcient S/N as well as
to distinguish the most characteristic features of the pulse pro-
ﬁles. In order to account for lower statistics due to splitting the
observations into phasebins, we reduced the required minimum
S/N for re-binning the XIS spectra to 50 (45 for 6–7 keV) for
all phase intervals with exception of the phase interval covering
the pulse proﬁle minimum (Pb 3) where we required a minimum
S/N of 40 (35 for 6–7 keV). The PIN spectra were re-binned to a
minimum S/N of 15. We ignored the GSO spectra for the phase-
resolved analysis because of their low statistics.

We ﬁrst calculated the ratio of all phase-resolved spectra
with respect to the phase-averaged spectrum, allowing us to in-
vestigate the evolution of the phase-resolved spectra in a model-
independent way (Fig. 8). The spectrum of Pb 1 is most similar
in shape to the phase-averaged spectrum, which is not surpris-
ing as this phase interval covers the peak of the main pulse and
therefore contributes heavily to the phase-averaged spectrum.
All other ratios indicate changes in spectral shape. The spectrum
of the main minimum (Pb 3) is softer than that of the main pulse
and the spectrum of the emerging peak (Pb 4) is harder. The dif-
ferences of the main pulse spectrum with respect to the spectra
of the declining main pulse (Pb 2) and the emerging minimum
(Pb 5) are more complex.

We used the same spectral model for the phase-resolved
as for the phase-averaged analysis, but without the H-like iron
emission for the ﬁrst observation. Since we expect the detector
cross-calibration constants and the iron line energies to be inde-
pendent of the viewing angle onto the neutron star, these were
constrained to be the same for all phase intervals. On our ﬁnal
ﬁts, these parameters ended up to be identical to those of the
phase-averaged analysis to within their conﬁdence intervals. All
other parameters were ﬁtted individually for each phase interval.
Figure 9 presents the evolution of some of the ﬁt parameters
over pulse phase for both observations. We observe variations for
all continuum parameters as well as of the CRSF strength over
pulse phase. Variations of the hard power law ﬂux F15−50 keV, the
black body ﬂux FBB, and the iron line ﬂux (not shown) mostly
follow the pulse proﬁle. Trends are generally the same for Obs. I
and Obs. II, while absolute parameter values can be moderately
diﬀerent. In order to evaluate the signiﬁcance of parameter dif-
ferences in the presence of possible artiﬁcial dependencies we
calculated conﬁdence contours for two parameters of interest for
several parameter pairs, see Fig. 10.

The emerging minimum (Pb 5) shows the highest absorp-
tion and the main minimum (Pb 3) shows the lowest as well as
a comparatively weak and cool black body. These two phase
bins generally display the most distinct changes compared to
their neighbors. The contour plots conﬁrm that the diﬀerence
in NH between the two extremes is signiﬁcant. Regarding the
black body temperature they reveal that – with exception of
the main minimum – the phase intervals are consistent with
a kTBB of ∼0.6 keV and ∼0.7 keV for the ﬁrst and second
observation, respectively2. Changes of the absorption column
and black body temperature could not be constrained by the

rameter dependencies in the sense that higher values of NH correspond
to lower black body temperatures and ﬂuxes, although at ﬁrst glance

apparent source position due to thermal wobbling might there-
fore introduce an unknown systematic uncertainty to the ﬂux
measured by XIS. For this reason, we normalized the detector
constants with respect to PIN. The ﬁtted ﬂuxes in the 15–50 keV
band are about 10% higher than the corresponding NuSTAR
observations, which agrees with ﬂux calibration uncertainties
(Madsen et al. 2015).

For future reference, we also determined the continuum ﬂux
for other energy bands than given in Table 2. For the ﬁrst obser-
vation, the measured ﬂuxes are (2.46± 0.05)× 10−9 erg s−1 cm−2
and (7.23 ± 0.07) × 10−9 erg s−1 cm−2 in the 2–10 keV and
3–60 keV band, respectively, and for the second observation
3.05+0.10−0.09×10−9 erg s−1 cm−2 and (9.32±0.10)×10−9 erg s−1 cm−2
for the corresponding energy bands.

Figure 7 shows the unfolded spectra of Obs. I and Obs. II in
comparison and the photon ratio of both observations. We ob-
serve a slight change in spectral slope below ∼2.5 keV, while the
ratio is mainly ﬂat above this energy, with slight diﬀerences in
the Fe band. Above the cyclotron line energy the spectra are very
similar in shape. Comparing the ﬁt parameters of both Suzaku
observations, we ﬁnd a decrease of the photon index and the
folding energies towards higher ﬂux. F¨urst et al. (2014) observed
the opposite trend regarding the ﬁrst and second NuSTAR obser-
vation. There is, however, an artiﬁcial correlation between these
two parameters, which is not taken into account here, so we can-
not conclude that the Suzaku and NuSTAR results contradict
each other. The excess of soft photons in Obs. I below ∼2.5 keV
is at least partly explained by the increase of the black body tem-
perature from Obs. I to Obs. II, while the relative normalization
of the black body component is very similar in both observa-
tions. This behavior is consistent with NuSTAR. See F¨urst et al.
(2014) for a more detailed investigation of the parameter evolu-
tion over the outburst.
The ﬁtted NH value is comparable to the value of 0.89 ×
1022 cm−2 given by The Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) Survey
of Galactic HI (Kalberla et al. 2005).

Conﬁrming the picture obtained from the spectral ratios of
Fig. 8, the phase variation of Γ shows that the power law is
comparatively soft during the main minimum (Pb 3) and the
emerging minimum (Pb 5). For Obs. I, the contours show that
the softest and hardest Γ values are indeed signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from each other. The folding energy is roughly correlated with
Γ. The Efold-Γ contours reveal that this variation is at least in part
due to the model intrinsic correlation between these two param-
eters. Our results indicate that Γ and Efold are high during the
secondary minimum (Pb 5) and that the CRSF is strongest dur-
ing the main minimum (Pb 3) and secondary peak (Pb 4) which
is qualitatively consistent with the higher resolution NuSTAR
analysis (20 phase bins, F¨urst et al. 2014). The NuSTAR analy-
sis also found a slight softening during the main minimum.

trade-oﬀ happens with a softer power law instead.

Lutovinov 2005). The accreting pulsar best known to show emis-
sion lines from neutral, He-like and H-like iron is the persistent
source Cen X-3, where the individual line strengths are vary-
ing over the binary orbit, constraining diﬀerent emission regions
(Naik et al. 2011a).
Although the ∼12.2 keV center energy of the cyclotron line is
not covered by the Suzaku instruments, this feature was included
in the spectral model, as the line wings aﬀect the spectral shape.
The correction due to the cyclotron line is most prominent during
the pulse minimum and the emerging second peak, consistent
with the NuSTAR-detected line variability (F¨urst et al. 2014).

Consistent with earlier observations (e.g., Naik et al. 2006),
the pulse proﬁles are highly energy dependent, especially the
evolution from one broad peak to one broad and one nar-
row peak towards higher energies is observed. Many neutron
star binaries show the opposite behavior with peaks vanish-
ing at high energies, e.g., 4U 0115+634 (M¨uller et al. 2010),
4U 1909+07 (F¨urst et al. 2011), Vela X-1 (Kreykenbohm et al.
2002), GX 304−1 (Devasia et al. 2011), 1A 1118−61 (Suchy
et al. 2011; Maitra et al. 2012), GRO J1008−57 (Naik et al.
2011b) or EXO 2030+375 (Naik et al. 2013). We note, however,
that IGR J16393−4643 shows an evolution with energy that is
similar to that in KS 1947+300 (Islam et al. 2015). Islam et al.
(2015) suggest that additional soft photons from the oﬀ-pulse re-
gions or a more direct view into the emission region at the peak
are the reason for the observed spectral variation.

The characteristic narrow and sharp peak observed in the
pulse proﬁles of KS 1947+300 could be caused by relativistic
light bending eﬀects, allowing constraints on the inclination of
the observer and the magnetic ﬁeld. Such parameters are gener-
ally very diﬃcult to determine. Any additional information on
the geometry of the system, as provided, e.g., by a sharp feature,
reduces the number of free parameters and thus simpliﬁes the
modeling of the pulse proﬁles. The energy dependence might
be caused by an energy-dependent beam pattern and contribu-
tions from the accretion column, the neutron star surface and
a surrounding halo (Kraus et al. 1989, 2003; Falkner 2013). A
quantitative modeling of the pulse proﬁles is, however, beyond
the scope of this paper and will be presented in a forthcoming
publication.

The high sensitivity of Suzaku XIS in the soft X-rays al-
lows us to additionally investigate spectral variation over pulse
phase below 3 keV. We ﬁnd the spectrum to be softer during the
two minimum phases Pb 3 and Pb 5. Despite strong correlations
between the continuum parameters (Fig. 10), the soft spectrum
during Pb 3 appears to be due to a combination of a lower NH
together with a softening of the underlying continuum. If true,
this overall phase dependence of NH would imply the presence
of at most moderately ionized material that is located close to
the neutron star and coupled to its magnetic ﬁeld. In our model,
we use a neutral absorption component, which is a common ap-
proach in accreting X-ray pulsars. This is valid because most
of the absorption happens by K-shell electrons, so a moderately
ionized medium can still be successfully modelled with a neu-
tral absorber. We also applied the analytic warmabs model as
part of the XSTAR3 software package and found that an ionized
absorber does not improve our ﬁt signiﬁcantly in terms of χ2 and
the resulting ionization fractions are very low in both observa-
tions (log ξ ∼ −0.05).

While the general dependence of the spectral properties on
pulse phase is in line with results from the 2000/2001 outburst

6. Discussion and Conclusions
In this paper we reported on spectral and timing analyses of
two observations of the 2013 outburst of KS 1947+300. The
phase-averaged spectrum shows emission features at energies
∼6.4 keV, ∼6.7 keV, and – for the ﬁrst observation – also at
∼6.9 keV, which we interpret as Kα emission from neutral, He-
like, and H-like iron. This is the ﬁrst time lines from diﬀerent
ionization states of iron are detected in this source. The neutral
line could also be a blend of other ionization states, which cannot
be distinguished with the available data.

Observations of the 2000/2001 outburst already found in-
dications for the presence of neutral (Tsygankov & Lutovinov
2005, with RXTE) or He-like iron (Naik et al. 2006, with
BeppoSAX), however, none of these observations showed the
diﬀerent ionization stages at the same time, probably due to the
lower energy resolution of the earlier instruments. NuSTAR,
with an energy resolution that is a factor of ∼2 worse than the
XIS, only detected one line feature at 6.5 keV, hinting at the
presence of ionization features (F¨urst et al. 2014), similar to the
variability of the line energy seen with RXTE (Tsygankov &

(Galloway et al. 2004; Naik et al. 2006), our results diﬀer in
that no NH variability was seen in the older data. It is well
known that NH in accreting neutron stars strongly depends on
the assumed underlying continuum model (see, e.g., the model-
ing of the NH variability of 4U 1538−522; Hemphill et al. 2014).
A possible explanation for this discrepancy could therefore be
that the pulse phase variability of the earlier outburst was de-
scribed by the variation of the optical depth and temperature
of a thermal Comptonization model (compTT Hua & Titarchuk
1995) to which a soft black body was added. This approach in-
deed resulted in much lower NH values (NH ∼ 5 × 1021 cm−2,
i.e., the minimum NH detectable with the RXTE-PCA, but well
within the range accessible by BeppoSAX; Galloway et al. 2004;
Naik et al. 2006). Our attempts to model the 2013 data with
a Comptonization continuum resulted in barely acceptable ﬁts
(χ2
red(d.o.f) = 1.56(561)
for Obs. II), and even though NH turned out to be comparable
with the 2000/2001 values, the ﬁts still showed a similar pulse
phase dependency of NH to that found with the empirical models
employed in Sect. 5.

red(d.o.f) = 1.43(715) for Obs. I and χ2

A next step in describing the data would be to replace
empirical models such as our approach or single temperature
Comptonization models with a fully self-consistent description
of the physical processes in the accretion column (e.g., Becker
& Wolﬀ 2007, and references therein). The publicly available
XSPEC model compmag (Farinelli et al. 2012) provides a numer-
ical solution of the equation of radiative transfer given in Becker
& Wolﬀ (2007) modiﬁed by a second order bulk Componization
term and allowing for other velocity proﬁles than considered
in Becker & Wolﬀ (2007). We have tried to ﬁt the compmag
model to the phase-averaged spectra which turned out not to
describe the data successfully. We note, however, the compmag
model uses a blackbody seed spectrum to be convolved with the
Green’s function, whereas in the full Becker & Wolﬀ (2007)
model, also bremsstrahlung and cyclotron emission contribute
to the seed spectrum, which play a dominant role at high lumi-
nosities. The compmag model is therefore rather applicable to
low luminosity observations and does not ﬁt the bright observa-
tions of KS 1947+300 very well. Members of our team are cur-
rently in the process of preparing an implementation of the full
model of Becker & Wolﬀ (2007). An independent implementa-
tion of the Becker & Wolﬀ (2007) model, together with a thermal
Comptonization component has been applied successfully to the
spectrum of 4U 0115+634 by Ferrigno et al. (2009).

For a full picture of the accretion mechanism, combined
spectral and timing analysis is required. The self-consistent
modeling of both the spectra and the pulse proﬁles will ﬁnally al-
low us to disentangle artiﬁcial parameter correlations and track
physical properties over pulse phase. This is, however, a very
challenging undertaking due to large number of free parameters
and because the required computing time is very high in both the
spectral and geometrical models. Huge eﬀorts in developing and
improving these models have been made for several years now
and we are still at a point, where every successful application to
observational data provides a valuable example. KS 1947+300
seems to be a promising candidate for more dedicated studies
and we hope that additional constraints on the source geometry
will eventually help to improve our understanding of the spec-
tral and angular redistribution of radiation inside the accretion
column.
