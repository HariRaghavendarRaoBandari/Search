The study of transverse optical pattern formation has been studied extensively in nonlinear optics, with a recent experimental
interest in studying the phenomenon using cold atoms, which can undergo real-space self-organization. Here, we describe our
experimental observation of pattern formation in cold atoms, which occurs using less than 1 µW of applied power. We show
that the optical patterns and the self-organized atomic structures undergo continuous symmetry-breaking, which is characteristic
of non-equilibrium phenomena in a multimode system. To theoretically describe pattern formation in cold atoms, we present a
self-consistent model that allows for tight atomic bunching in the applied optical lattice. We derive the nonlinear refractive index
of a gas of multi-level atoms in an optical lattice, and we derive the threshold conditions under which pattern formation occurs.
We show that, by using small detunings and sub-Doppler temperatures, one achieves two orders of magnitude reduced intensity
thresholds for pattern formation compared to warm atoms.

Spontaneous pattern formation is a phenomenon that occurs
in nearly all branches of science and has led to new insights into
nonlinear dynamics on multiple scales of nature. In nonlinear
optics and atomic physics, transverse optical pattern formation
has been studied for more than three decades and has led to
advances in all-optical switching and a better understanding of
absolute instabilities [1].

Transverse optical pattern formation describes the sponta-
neous formation of new optical ﬁelds via nonlinear optical
wave-mixing processes. When optical ﬁelds counterpropagate
through a nonlinear optical material, such as an atomic va-
por, they induce a nonlinear refractive index in the atoms.
Above a threshold nonlinear refractive index, an instability gen-
erates new optical ﬁelds, which are called optical patterns for
their characteristic multimode, petal-like structure. Until re-
cently [2–4], transverse optical pattern formation has only been
studied using warm atomic vapors [5–7]. However, new physics
is accessible when studying pattern formation in cold atoms.

When optical ﬁelds interact with cold atoms, they impart
a dipole force that can inﬂuence the center-of-mass degrees
of freedom of the atoms such that the atoms spatially bunch
into real-space structures. Therefore, by studying the forma-
tion of optical patterns in cold atoms, one can also study the
spontaneous formation of new atomic structures, also known
as atomic self-organization. Self-organization has been studied
extensively in single-mode cavities [8, 9]. However, by studying
pattern formation in cold atoms, one gains access to a multi-
mode geometry, in which one can study continuous symmetry-
breaking and phase transitions that are inaccessible in a single-
mode system [10].

In this paper, we present our experimental observation of pat-
tern formation in sub-Doppler-cooled atoms, which was ﬁrst re-
ported in Ref. [2]. We show that we observe patterns at record-
low powers, and we analyze the temporal dynamics of the
power in the generated ﬁelds. We ﬁnd that the optical patterns
and the corresponding self-organized atomic structures [11] un-
dergo continuous symmetry-breaking, which characteristic of
non-equilibrium phenomena in a multimode geometry.

In addition, we present a theoretical description of pat-
tern formation in cold atoms, which incorporates atomic self-
organization into “atomic patterns.” Existing theoretical de-
scriptions of real-space pattern formation in cold atoms are

restricted to the regime of weak atomic bunching [12], where
the dipole potential energy of the applied lattice is comparable
to the thermal energy of the atoms. The theoretical model pre-
sented in this paper is unique in that it is self-consistent and
allows for tight atomic bunching, where one can achieve en-
hanced light-atom interaction strengths [13]. In addition, while
other models for pattern formation describe self-organization
in momentum space [4], our model explicitly considers the self-
organization of atoms into real-space structures, which is of in-
terest for studying non-equilibrium phenomena in cold atoms.
We use our model to derive the threshold conditions above
which patterns form, and we provide an analysis of optimizing
the nonlinear refractive index to achieve pattern formation at
ultra-low light levels. We show that real-space self-organization
of atoms gives rise to an enhanced nonlinear refractive index,
which reduces the threshold powers required for pattern for-
mation. We ﬁnd that, by using small detunings and far-sub-
Doppler temperatures, one can achieve more than an order of
magnitude reduction in the intensity required to observe pat-
tern formation c.f. warm atoms [7] and cold-atom experiments
that work closer to the Doppler temperature [4].

The outline of this paper is as follows. We ﬁrst brieﬂy de-
scribe our experimental observation of pattern formation in cold
atoms. We then go on to describe theoretically the interaction
of counterpropagating optical ﬁelds with multi-level atoms. We
analyze the nonlinear refractive index nNL for atoms in a one-
dimensional (1D) optical lattice in the regime of strong light-
atom interactions with multi-level atoms, and we discuss how
to optimize nNL to reach the threshold for pattern formation
at ultra-low intensities. We then extend this 1D model to two
spatial dimensions and perform a stability analysis to derive
the threshold condition under which pattern formation occurs.
Finally, we compare these predictions to our experimental data.

I. OVERVIEW OF THE EXPERIMENT

In the experiment, we cool and trap a cloud of 87Rb atoms in
an anisotropic magneto-optical trap (MOT) to an initial sub-
Doppler temperature of Tinit (cid:39) 30 µK [14], where the Doppler
temperature is TD = 146 µK. We then apply counterprop-
agating optical ﬁelds in a lin⊥lin polarization conﬁguration

ﬁelds as a function of time for Ip = 12 mW/cm2 and ∆ = 2π ×
(−24) MHz. (b) Zooming in on the formation of the patterns, the
exponential ﬁt (red, solid curve) to a function of the form aexp[(t −
tδ)/τ ] + b has an exponential constant τ = 5.8 µs.

experiments, we load the MOT for 97 ms and then shut the
cooling and trapping beams oﬀ. We then turn on the pump
beams for 3 ms to perform experiments, where the patterns
persist for 1 − 2.4 ms.
We observe the minimum threshold at a single-ﬁeld intensity
of Ip = 0.8Isat or a power of ∼400 nW at ∆ = −4Γ, where
Isat = 1.3 mW/cm2 is the resonant saturation intensity. The
generated optical ﬁelds propagate along a cone of half-angle
θ (cid:39) 3 − 10 mrad, which conserves momentum in the wave-
mixing process [16]. We observe frequency-degenerate pattern
formation, so that all the optical ﬁelds generated have the same
output frequency ω as the applied pump ﬁelds, and they have a
polarization that matches the nearly counterpropagating pump
ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 1(a). When imaged in the transverse
plane, we observe optical patterns that have between two and
fourteen spots, as shown in Fig. 1(b).

These optical patterns are correlated with associated atomic
patterns in the atoms, which arise due to atomic bunching in
the dipole potential wells generated by the interference among
the pattern-forming optical ﬁelds and the applied pump ﬁelds.
These atomic patterns, or self-organized atomic structures, oc-
cur within each pancake described in Fig. 1(a). For example, a
two-spot optical pattern will create a striped-like interference
pattern within each pancake, which in turn gives rise to striped
dipole potential wells into which the atoms can bunch, as de-
picted in Fig. 3. Similarly, higher-order optical patterns will
generate more complicated atomic patterns.

In Ref. [11], we provide a direct observation of real-space
atomic self-organization due to pattern formation in cold
atoms. We use parametric resonance techniques to verify that
the atoms bunch into the self-generated dipole potentials simu-
lated in Fig. 3. We also ﬁnd that, above threshold for pat-
tern formation, the atoms also undergo spontaneous three-
dimensional (3D) Sisyphus cooling due to the interaction among
the generated and applied ﬁelds with the atoms. We use Bragg
scattering techniques to show that the temperature of atoms
along the radial direction cools to Tr (cid:39) 2− 3 µK above thresh-
old for pattern formation. Thus, in this paper, we do not ac-
count for Sisyphus cooling, which gives rise to a non-equilibrium
gas [17]. Instead, we approximate the momentum distribution
of the atoms using a simpliﬁed Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-
tion characterized by the temperature of the atoms after they
have undergone Sisyphus cooling (T (cid:39) 2 − 3 µK).

We also observe that the optical/atomic patterns are not

optical ﬁelds to a cloud of atoms of length L = 3 cm and width w ∼
400 µm. The 1/e2 beam waist of the pump ﬁelds is ∼ 410 µm. The
arrows/circles denote the lin⊥lin electric ﬁeld polarizations. The
ﬁelds generated in the wave-mixing process propagate along a cone
of half-angle θ. We denote the ﬁelds propagating along or nearly
along the “forward” +ˆz-direction as F (z), f+(z, r), and f−(z, r),
and those along the “backward” −ˆz-direction as B(z), b+(z, r), and
b−(z, r). (b) Examples of two- and fourteen-spot optical patterns,

k is the wavevector in vacuum, and φ is an arbitrary relative
phase between the ﬁelds. We typically use optical ﬁelds of
frequency ω with a detuning ∆ = ω − ωeg (cid:39) −3 to − 10Γ
from the resonant transition frequency ωeg of the 52S1/2(F =
2) → 52P3/2(F (cid:48) = 3) transition of 87Rb, where Γ is the natu-
ral linewidth of the transition. Upon applying this 1D optical
lattice, the atoms undergo Sisyphus cooling to a ﬁnal tempera-
ture along ±ˆz of Tz (cid:39) 2 − 3 µK [2], while below threshold, the
temperature along the radial direction remains Tr (cid:39) 30 µK. Af-
ter cooling, the thermal energy of the atoms is typically much
less than the dipole potential of the applied 1D lattice, and
the atoms spatially bunch into the potential minima and form
pancake-like structures, as depicted in Fig. 1(a).

By using relatively small detunings and employing Sisy-
phus cooling, we enhance the nonlinear refractive index of the
atoms [13]. Above a threshold nonlinear refractive index, a
transverse instability generates new nonlinear wave-mixing pro-
cesses, which generate new optical ﬁelds (optical patterns) and
atomic structures (atomic patterns).

Once the patterns begin to form, there is an exponential
buildup of the power in the optical patterns, as shown in Fig. 2.
Figure 2(a) shows the typical temporal dynamics of the power
in the optical patterns, where the pump beams are turned on at
time ton = 0. Figure 2(b) provides a closer look at the behavior
of the generated ﬁelds close to time ton. Once a ﬁnite ﬁeld
begins to form, there is an exponential increase in the power
generated in the wave-mixing process, which is the expected
behavior for such wave-mixing instabilities [15]. For typical

II. APPLIED 1D OPTICAL LATTICE

To describe theoretically the light-atom interaction that gives
rise to pattern formation, we ﬁrst consider the nonlinear re-
fractive index induced in the atoms by the applied counter-
propagating optical ﬁelds, i.e., below the threshold for pattern
formation.
In the next section, we extend this formalism to
the above-threshold case to describe pattern formation in cold
atoms.

A standard method for describing light-atom interactions is
to deﬁne the material polarization, or the dipole moment per
unit volume, of the atoms and to then solve the wave equation
for the optical ﬁelds interacting with them. We consider a sim-
pliﬁed J = 1/2 → J(cid:48) = 3/2 spin model for 87Rb. While we can-
not realistically ignore the hyperﬁne structure, a ﬁne-structure
model is known to provide a good qualitative understanding
of the experiment when most (∼90%) of the atoms are tightly
bunched and only undergo stretched-state transitions, as they
are in our experiment [2].
The material polarization for a gas of multi-level atoms with
ground states g ≡ ±1/2 and excited states e ≡ ±1/2,±3/2 is

where (cid:126)µge is the dipole moment, η(z) is the density distribu-
tion, ρnm are the density matrix elements, T1 is the lifetime
of the excited state, and T2 is the characteristic dephasing
time [18]. We assume collisional dephasing is negligible and
take T2 = 2T1 = 1/Γ, and we take all the population to be
evenly distributed between the two ground states. We work
in the regime where the intensity is much less than the oﬀ-
resonant saturation intensity Is∆ = Isat(1 + 4∆2Γ2) so that the
polarization becomes

The last term in square brackets represents the saturable non-
linearity. The density distribution η(z) contains intensity-
dependent terms that give rise to a bunching-induced nonlin-
earity.
In the remainder of this section, we investigate these
nonlinearities in the multi-level-atom picture to deﬁne the non-
linear refractive index for a gas of sub-Doppler-cooled atoms in
a 1D optical lattice. We also show how this diﬀers from the
two-level-atom, lin||lin conﬁguration described in Ref. [13].
This model ignores Raman transitions between the mJ =
±1/2 ground states, which is a good approximation when the
atoms are tightly bunched at regions of ˆσ± polarization. How-
ever, this is not a good approximation for other experiments
that use higher-temperature atoms [4], and any extension of
this model to describe those systems should account for these
transitions.

One of the main diﬀerences between the cold-atom case and

terns within each pancake.

necessarily stationary, and they can rotate/reorganize during a
single experiment. To measure this pattern rotation, we split
the path of the generated ﬁelds and place apertures that se-
lect two distinct emission regions, as depicted in the inset of
Fig. 4. The amplitudes of the generated ﬁeld power through
each aperture are shown together in Fig. 4 as a function of
time. The observed anti-correlation between these modes (cor-
relation factor = -0.2) indicates that the generated ﬁelds are
rotating between these spatial modes. The fastest timescale
for ﬂuctuations between modes is ∼50 µs, which is the order
of the time it takes for an atom to move a distance dp and
thus contribute to exciting a diﬀerent optical/atomic pattern.
This type of continuous symmetry-breaking is a hallmark of
multimode non-equilibrium phenomena like pattern formation.

We observe optical/atomic pattern formation at record-low
powers because we use sub-Doppler temperatures and small de-
tunings. This experimental regime facilitates enhanced light-
atom interactions because the atoms tightly bunch in regions
of pure ˆσ± polarizations, where the atoms interact strongly
with the optical ﬁelds. To theoretically describe pattern for-
mation in this regime, we develop a new model that allows
for tight atomic bunching in the applied lattice, as existing
models are restricted to homogeneous [6] or weakly bunched
atoms [12]. We also require a model that accounts for real-
space self-organization of the atoms during pattern formation.
In the remainder of this paper, we presents this theoretical
model, which self-consistently describes optical/atomic pattern
formation in both the weak- and tight-bunching regimes.

the well-studied warm-atom case [6] is the spatial dependence of
η(z). In warm atoms η(z) ≡ na, where na is the average atomic
density. In cold atoms, however, the atoms can spatially bunch
in the dipole potential wells created by the optical ﬁelds, which
results in a qualitatively diﬀerent density distribution.

The density distribution η(z) depends on the ratio of the
dipole potential to the thermal energy of the atoms. The dipole
potential U (z) in the lin⊥lin polarization conﬁguration is more
complicated than in the lin||lin polarization conﬁguration be-
cause the electric ﬁeld polarization varies periodically in space.
This periodically varying polarization gives rise to two super-
imposed light shifts

which deﬁne the dipole potentials for atoms in the mJ =
±1/2 ground states, respectively [2, 19]. For atoms in the
mJ = +1/2 ground state, there are two transitions that
the mJ = +1/2 →
contribute to the dipole potential:
mJ(cid:48) = +3/2 transition (Clebsch-Gordon coeﬃcient=1), and
the mJ = +1/2 → mJ(cid:48) = −1/2 transition (Clebsch-Gordon

coeﬃcient= (cid:112)1/3). We determine these separately accord-

ing to U +(z) = U +
p,+1/2→−1/2(z). We note
that Isat = 2Γ20c/2|µ±|2. We deﬁne F (z) = ˜F eiδz and
B(z) = ˜Be−iδz, where δ deﬁnes the phase shift acquired by
the ﬁeld component as it propagates through the atoms. We
deﬁne IF = 20c ˜F 2 and IB = 20c ˜B2, where c is the speed of
light in vacuum and 0 is the permittivity of free space, and we
assume equal-intensity pump ﬁelds IF = IB = Ip. It follows
that

where k(cid:48) = k+δ is the wavevector of the optical ﬁelds inside the

optical ﬁelds as they propagate through the atoms of index of
refraction n (cid:39) 1+χeﬀ/2, where χeﬀ is the eﬀective susceptibilty.

|C1/2,−1/2|2 = 2/3, which is the diﬀerence of the square of the

ground state leads to the deﬁnitions

These superimposed dipole potentials are phase-shifted by π/2
and their minima coincide with the locations of circular elec-
tric ﬁeld polarizations depicted in Fig. 5(a). The phase-shifted
potentials are depicted in Fig. 5(b), which show how each po-
tential distribution varies with the electric ﬁeld polarization.
An example density distribution, which is derived in Sec. II A,
is given in Fig. 5(c) and shows how the atoms bunch at the lo-
cations of circular ﬁeld polarizations when the dipole potential
energy is greater than the thermal energy of the atoms.

constant to Eq. 12, the density distribution η(z) is properly
normalized for the lin⊥lin polarization conﬁguration.

The density distribution in Eq. 12 contains highly nonlinear
terms in the polarization of Eq. 3 for the tight-bunching regime;
e.g., when |ζ| (cid:38) 0.8, the Bessel functions of Eq. 20 give rise
to non-negligible χ(5) and higher-order terms. Therefore, by
working in the tight-bunching regime using sub-Doppler tem-
peratures and small detunings, one can enhance the nonlinear
index of refraction and study nonlinear optical eﬀects even at
low intensities.

To study the tight-bunching regime theoretically, it is neces-
sary to use the normalization constant deﬁned in Eq. 20. This
normalization constant provides self-consistency to our model,
while other models that do not account for this normalization
are restricted to the weak bunching regime [12], where |ζ| (cid:39) 1.
By properly normalizing the density distribution, one can pre-
dict the enhancement in the nonlinear index of refraction that
is achievable by working in the tight-bunching regime, where
|ζ| (cid:29) 1. In order to solve for the explicit dependence of the
index of refraction on ζ, it is necessary to solve the wave equa-
tion for the coupled forward and backward ﬁeld amplitudes
F (z) and B(z).

III. CALCULATING THE REFRACTIVE INDEX FOR

A LIN⊥LIN LATTICE

To describe the light-atom interaction that gives rise to pat-
tern formation, it is ﬁrst necessary to deﬁne the index of re-
fraction imposed in the atoms by the applied lin⊥lin optical
lattice. The index of refraction is calculated by solving the

Since we assume ˜I (cid:28) 1, this implies that there is a ﬁnite but
small light-atom interaction for blue detunings in the zero tem-
perature limit. In contrast, in the lin||lin, two-level-atom case,
this limit goes to zero because the atoms tightly bunch at the in-
tensity zeroes. In contrast, the intensity is nonzero everywhere
in the lin⊥lin polarization conﬁguration. However, when we
account for a multi-level atomic structure in a lin⊥lin conﬁgu-
ration, where the intensity is always nonzero, the atoms always
have a ﬁnite probability of interacting with the ﬁelds. For ex-
ample, an atom in the mJ = −1/2 state minimizes its energy
in the presence of a blue-detuned optical lattice by spatially
bunching at a location of ˆσ+-polarization.
In this case, the
atoms are not pumped into the stretched state. However, the
atom can still be pumped via the weaker transition into the
mJ(cid:48) = +1/2 excited state. Therefore, the conditions are never
optimal for the atom to interact strongly with the optical ﬁelds,
but the atoms may still always interact with them.

The atoms thus experience a much larger phase shift for red de-
tunings. This is the expected result because the atoms bunch
into the regions of pure ˆσ± polarizations and continuously
pump into the stretched states for red-detuned optical ﬁelds.
In this case, unlike the blue-detuned case, the atoms are at-
tracted to spatial locations where they interact strongly with
the optical ﬁelds. It is for this reason that red detunings are op-
timal for achieving strong light-atom interactions in the regime
of small detunings, sub-Doppler temperatures, and tight atomic
bunching. We note that blue detunings are optimal in the low-
intensity case with weakly bunched atoms [12].
The index of refraction in the lin⊥lin polarization conﬁgura-
tion is n = nlin + nNL, where nlin = 1 + χlinC 2/2 is the linear
refractive index, and

is the nonlinear refractive index. This represents a self-

sub-Doppler-cooled atoms in a lin⊥lin optical lattice, which
can be used to predict and optimize the light-atom interaction
strength—not limited to the zero-temperature limits discussed
in this section.

Above a threshold value of nNL, there exist transverse per-
In

turbations that give rise to transverse pattern formation.

order to deﬁne this threshold, we perform a stability analysis
to derive the conditions under which transverse perturbations
experience suﬃcient gain to form transverse patterns.

IV. STABILITY ANALYSIS

A stability analysis is a standard technique for deriving
the threshold condition for transverse optical pattern forma-
tion [22–24]. To simplify the stability analysis, we consider a
two-spot optical pattern, whose beam geometry is depicted in
Fig. 1(a), and whose electric ﬁeld amplitude goes as

−→
E 0(z, r) = F (z)eikz ˆx + eiφB(z)e−ikz ˆy+
eiφαf+(z, r)eik(cosθz−sinθr) ˆy + eiφαf−(z, r)eik(cosθz+sinθr) ˆy+
αb+(z, r)eik(−cosθz−sinθr) ˆx + αb−(z, r)eik(−cosθz+sinθr) ˆx,
(29)

where we use α to keep track of the order of the small-amplitude
generated ﬁelds. We use these polarizations because these are
the relative polarizations we observe experimentally. However,
it is straightforward to extend this analysis to study alternative
polarization conﬁgurations. We again take φ = −π/2 so that
the polarization of all ﬁelds at z = 0 is ˆσ−-polarized. With this
modiﬁed electric ﬁeld, the density distribution can be separated
into those components of the dipole potential arising solely due
to the pump-pump gratings and those arising due to the gener-
ated pump-pattern gratings. The density distribution deﬁning
atoms in the mJ = ±1/2 ground states above threshold for
pattern formation is

η±(z, r) = η±(z)exp

,

(30)

(cid:20)
− U±

pp(z, r)
kBT

(cid:21)

where the argument of the second exponential contains terms of
order α and deﬁnes the transverse density perturbations that
arise due to the interference of a pump ﬁeld and a pattern-
forming ﬁeld. We take the normalization constant to be that
from Eq. 19, i.e., deﬁned by the pump-pump gratings, which is
a good approximation close to threshold.

To derive the threshold condition, we are interested in the
regime where the generated ﬁelds are very weak. In this case,
the pump-pattern dipole potentials are very shallow, so that
the Taylor expansion

(31)

is valid. Equation 31 deﬁnes the transverse perturbations to
the density distribution. Atoms that bunch into these pertur-
bative gratings are termed “self-organized” because they are
not imposed by externally applied optical ﬁelds [11]. These
terms further enhance the material polarization and the power
in the generated ﬁelds. In Eq. 31,

but where we only retain those terms of order α that give rise to
self-organized gratings. We neglect terms of order α2 or higher
because those correspond to the interference of two generated

(cid:34)

ﬁelds, which are orders of magnitude weaker and negligible close
to threshold. Simplifying, the polarization components become

For the example case of a detuning ˜∆ = −5, our experimen-
tally measured temperature T = 3 µK, and an optical depth
(OD) of 20, where OD = 6πnaL/k2 and we take L = 3 cm,
the solution is shown in Fig. 6 for the predicted pump inten-
sity as a function of the phase mismatch k[1 − cos(θ)]. The
blue (lower) curve represents the minimum solution. The or-
ange (higher) curve represents another higher numerical solu-
tion. This solution shows that, for k[1 − cos(θ)] = 0 (θ = 0),
the intensity required to generate new optical ﬁelds approaches
inﬁnity. However, at a ﬁnite angle, one can generate new op-
tical ﬁelds. This is consistent with the concept of weak wave
retardation discussed in Ref. [16], which tells us that the wave-
mixing process that generates new ﬁelds requires a ﬁnite angle
for phase-matching.
The minimum point on the blue curve in Fig. 6 at k[1 −
cos(θ)] (cid:39) 120 provides a theoretical prediction for the angle of
emission of the generated ﬁelds: θ (cid:39) 5 mrad, which is consis-
tent with our typical experimental observations. The minimum
point also predicts the minimum intensity threshold for these
parameters: Ip/Isat (cid:39) 0.1.

factors: 1. There are statistical errors in the initial measure-
ments of ˜I, ˜∆, L, and the OD. 2. There are additional statisti-
cal errors in the measurement of ˜I due to the beam reshaping
eﬀect discussed in the caption of Fig. 1. 3. There are additional
statistical errors in L because the generated ﬁelds may emerge
from the cloud before propagating its full length, thus reduc-
ing the eﬀective length of the cloud. 4. This model assumes
perfectly counterpropagating pump beams, and thus any slight
mode-mismatch of the transverse pump proﬁle reduces the ef-
ﬁciency of the wave-mixing process and increases the intensity
threshold. 5. This model assumes a uniform atomic density
across the pump beams, which is not the case when the pump
beam size is comparable to the width of the atomic cloud, and
6. We do not explicitly account for Sisyphus cooling. With
the use of a free parameter, the predicted theoretical curves ﬁt
well to our experimental data in Fig. 7. The observed increase
in threshold for small detunings in Fig. 7(a) is attributed to
increased absorption.

The observed intensity thresholds for pattern formation
shown in Fig. 7 are more than two orders of magnitude smaller
than that observed in warm atoms [7] and more than one order
of magnitude smaller than that observed in cold-atom experi-
ments that use higher, but still sub-Doppler, temperatures [4].
Our observation of ultra-low threshold powers is a manifes-
tation of the enhancement of nNL that is achievable by us-
ing small detunings and far-sub-Doppler-cooled atoms. Our
self-consistent model provides the means by which to study
nonlinear optical eﬀects in ultracold atoms, such as coupled
optical/atomic pattern formation, where one can achieve en-
hanced light-atom interaction strengths and multimode self-
organization.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we provide an overview of our experimental
observation of pattern formation in cold atoms, and we describe
the characteristics of the coupled optical/atomic patterns. We
present a theoretical description for multi-level atoms in an op-
tical lattice. We derive the index of refraction for sub-Doppler-
cooled atoms in a lin⊥lin optical lattice, and we discuss how
this diﬀers from the lin||lin case. We then extend this model
to a two-dimensional geometry with multiple optical ﬁelds in
order to describe two-spot optical pattern formation. We then
perform a stability analysis in order to derive the threshold
condition for generating patterns, and we compare this to our
experimental results.

This work represents the ﬁrst stability analysis for pattern
formation in cold atoms that allows for tight atomic bunching.
This self-consistent description is useful for describing pattern
formation experiments with strong light-atom interactions, in
which one can study low-light-level nonlinear optics in cold
atoms. This model also shows the importance of accounting
for transverse perturbations in the density distribution, i.e., the
self-organized atomic structures, which enhances the refractive
index of the atoms during and above threshold for pattern for-
mation and give rise to multimode atomic self-organization at
low light levels.

FIG. 6: Predicted intensity vs. phase mismatch. Single-beam
intensity normalized by the resonant saturation intensity as a func-
tion of the phase mismatch k(1− cosθ), where again k is the vacuum
wavevector and θ is the angle between the generated ﬁelds and the
applied (pump) ﬁelds. This is for the speciﬁc case of an optical depth
of 20, ˜∆ = −4, L = 3 cm, and ˜T = 3/146.

FIG. 7: Results of stability analysis. Single-beam intensity nor-
malized by the resonant saturation intensity as a function of (a) the

with a free parameter value p = 6, and (b) the optical depth for the
speciﬁc case of an optical depth of ˜∆ = −5, L = 3 cm, ˜T = 3/146,
and a free parameter value p = 54. The blue curve represents the
predictions from Eq. 45 with free parameter ˜I → p ˜I, and the red
points represent experimental data. The red rectangle(s) represent
the statistical error due to the initial intensity measurement, the
detuning measurement, and the conﬁdence interval of the ﬁt to the
OD measurement.

focusing (defocusing) for blue (red) detunings, and thus theo-
retical models describing pattern formation in warm atoms con-
sider only blue-detuned optical ﬁelds [6]. However, in the low-
intensity regime for cold atoms, the bunching-induced nonlin-
earity has a diﬀerent detuning dependence and is self-focusing
for red-detuned optical ﬁelds [13].

We solve Eq. 45 for other detunings and optical depths to
build theoretical curves from the extracted solutions for the
minimum predicted intensities. We show these theoretical re-
sults (blue) with experimental data points (red) in Fig. 7 as
functions of detuning and optical depth. To determine the ex-
perimental intensity threshold, we measure the power in the op-
tical patterns and reduce the total pump intensity while keeping
balanced intensities in the applied counterpropagating ﬁelds.
We deﬁne the threshold intensity when we detect no power in
the generated ﬁelds.
In the theoretical curves of Fig. 7, we incorporate a free pa-
rameter p used to adjust the eﬀective intensity ˜I → p ˜I. The
use of a free parameter adjusts the scale of the predicted curves
in order to test whether the predicted curvature matches the
experimental data. The deviation of the experiment from the
scale of the theoretical predictions may arise due to multiple
