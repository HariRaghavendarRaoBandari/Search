ABSTRACT
We report the discovery of two new millisecond pulsars (PSRs J0024−7204aa and
J0024−7204ab) in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104). Our results bring the
total number of pulsars in 47 Tucanae to 25. These pulsars were discovered by repro-
cessing archival observations from the Parkes radio telescope. We reprocessed the data
using a standard search procedure based on the PRESTO software package as well as
using a new method in which we incoherently added the power spectra corresponding
to ∼1100 hr of observations. The newly discovered PSR J0024−7204aa, has a pulse
frequency of ∼541 Hz (corresponding to a ∼1.84 ms period), which is higher than any
other pulsars currently known in the cluster and ranks 12th amongst all the currently
known pulsars. The dispersion measure of this pulsar, 24.941(7) cm−3 pc, is the high-
est in the cluster. The second discovered pulsar, PSR J0024−7204ab, is an isolated
pulsar with a pulse frequency of ∼270 Hz (corresponding to a period of ∼3.70 ms).

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of the ﬁrst globular cluster (GC) pulsar,
PSR B1821−24A in M28 (Lyne et al. 1987), GC environ-
ments have proven to be conducive to pulsar searches. Before
January 2016, 144 radio pulsars in 28 GCs1 had been discov-
ered. Many of the pulsars are exotic. With a spin frequency
of ∼716 Hz, PSR J1748−2446ad is the fastest-spinning pul-
sar known (Hessels et al. 2006). That pulsar was discovered
in the globular cluster Terzan 5, which has 35 known pul-
sars (Lyne et al. 1990; Lyne et al. 2000; Ransom et al. 2005;
Hessels et al. 2006; GC pulsars catalog1), the largest for any
GCs. Among all the GC pulsars, 80 are known to be in bi-
nary systems and 132 are millisecond pulsars with spin peri-
ods of 30 ms or shorter. Both fractions are much higher than
those of the Galactic population (see psrcat, Manchester et
al. 2005).

With 23 previously known radio pulsars, 47 Tucanae
(NGC 104) is the second most populated cluster. All the pul-
sars were discovered using the 64-m Parkes radio telescope
(Manchester et al. 1990; Manchester et al. 1991; Robinson
et al. 1995; Camilo et al. 2000; Freire et al. 2016, in prepara-
tion) and are millisecond pulsars. Freire et al. (2001a) used
observations of the pulsars in 47 Tucanae to make the ﬁrst
detection of ionized intracluster gas. Timing models for 15

of the pulsars in the cluster were presented by Freire et al.
(2001b) and updated by Freire et al. (2003).

One of the primary goals of modern-day pulsar astron-
omy is to discover a millisecond pulsar in orbit around a
stellar mass black hole. Evolutionary models suggest that
such a system is only likely to form in environments with
high stellar interaction rates. Therefore GCs provide some of
the most likely environments in which to ﬁnd such a system.
Finding such exotic systems is a primary goal of the Five-
hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
(Nan et al. 2011) currently under construction in China. The
full system testing will start in the middle of June 2016 fol-
lowed by an expected ﬁrst light on September 26th. Zhang
et al. (submitted to RAA) described how early FAST ob-
servations of GCs may ﬁnd pulsars by carrying out repeated
short drift-scan observations. Traditional pulsar searches are
based on the analysis of a single, long time sequence of data.
The requirement to carry out short observations during early
FAST operation implies that the data from multiple obser-
vations (taken on diﬀerent days) will need to be combined.
We thus developed a segmented search method operating on
power spectra. The testing and application of such a method
on the large number of 47 Tucanae observation data allowed
us to discover two new pulsars. Such experience is also valu-
able when planning our future FAST pulsar surveys.

In Section 2 of this paper, we describe the details of the
observations and data reduction. In Section 3, we describe

the discovery of two new pulsars. The conclusions are in
Section 4.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND PROCESSING

The aim of the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Re-
search Organization (CSIRO) pulsar data archive2 (Hobbs
et al. 2011) is to store pulsar data sets obtained using the
Parkes radio telescope. The archive now contains more than
300 TB of data and we were collating as much archival data
as possible. Freire et al. (private communication) provided
copies of observations of 47 Tucanae obtained between the
years 1999 and 2011. The observations were described in
Freire et al. (2001a) and Freire et al. (2001b). An analogue
ﬁlterbank backend was used to record the data with 512
frequency channels and 0.5 MHz channel width, correspond-
ing to a total bandwidth of 256 MHz centered at 1390 MHz.
The output of each ﬁlter was integrated for 80 µs and the
resulting power was then 1−bit digitized and stored onto
magnetic tapes. The majority of the observations were ob-
tained with the central beam of the 13-beam multibeam re-
ceiver (Staveley-Smith et al. 1996) in the 20 cm band. The
integration times varied from a few minutes (for test obser-
vations) to ∼8 hr. The dataset consisted mostly of high time
resolution data (aforementioned 80 µs sampling time) and a
small fraction of lower time resolution data (125 µs sampling
time).

The raw data ﬁles were originally extracted from the
tape ﬁles using the sc td software package and then con-
verted to the SIGPROC3 ﬁlterbank format using the filter-
bank procedure. The data were processed using two meth-
ods described below.

The ﬁrst method was a traditional pulsar acceleration
search using the PRESTO4 suite of software (Ransom et al.
2002). This method was applied to the observations individ-
ually. We initially de-dispersed the data with a dispersion
measure (DM) corresponding to about the median of the
values of the known pulsars in the globular cluster, namely
24.5 cm−3 pc, and then summed across the frequency chan-
nels. We then used the realfft and accelsearch routines
to perform the pulsar search. For the PRESTO accelera-
tion search, we summed up to 16 harmonics and chose 50 as
the maximum value of z (through the -zmax option in ac-
celsearch). This latter corresponds to the maximum num-
ber of adjacent Fourier bins that accelsearch considers
as the result of a possible drift of the intrinsic pulsar spin
frequency, due to the binary acceleration5 (Ransom et al.
2001).

For the second method we segmented each observation
into small ﬁles using the extract tool in the SIGPROC

4 http://www.cv.nrao.edu/∼sransom/presto/
5 The average acceleration of the pulsar in the integration can be
calculated as a = zc/(T2f0) (Ransom et al. 2001), in which c is
the speed of light, T is the total integration time, f0 is the pulsar
spin frequency. For our observation data, if the total integration
time was one hour, using 50 as the zmax value corresponded to
an acceleration of 5.8 m s−2 for a 200 Hz signal or 2.3 m s−2 for
a 500 Hz signal.

software package. Each ﬁle contained 223 samples corre-
sponding to an observation lasting ∼11 minutes. In this pro-
cess we ignored observations shorter than 11 minutes and
also discarded any data that remained after dividing the
observation into these residual segments. From all the ob-
servation data, we ended up with 5956 segmented ﬁles cor-
responding to ∼1110 hr of observation. Each of these 5956
segmented ﬁles were then de-dispersed (again using a dis-
persion measure of 24.5 cm−3 pc) and summed across the
frequency channels. During the de-dispersion, some samples
were lost due to the DM delay. For the 5956 segmented ﬁles,
in total we lost ∼243 second observation data, which is much
shorter than the total length of ∼1110 hr. We then stored the
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of each of these time series
on disk. We repeated this procedure, but did not de-disperse
the data ﬁles, i.e., this ﬁnal processing corresponded to a dis-
persion measure of 0 cm−3 pc.

Note that we did not expect to detect a given pulsar
in each data segment. The pulsars in 47 Tucanae are known
to scintillate and some of the binary systems can eclipse
the pulsar signal (such as, e.g., eclipsing PSRs J0024−7204J
and J0024−7204O, described in Freire et al. 2003). The ﬁrst
method produced a list of pulsar candidates for each ob-
servation that were then inspected by eye. Analysing the
FFTs from the second method was more complex and car-
ried out as follows. For each spectral frequency channel of
every observation segment, we had the real and imaginary
parts from the Fourier transform. The real and imaginary
parts were summed in quadrature to form the power values.
From 5956 observation segments, we obtained 5956 power
values for every frequency channel. For all the power values
of the same frequency channel, the mean value, the maxi-
mum value, and the standard deviation were calculated. An
example is shown in Figure 1, that shows the power spectra
around the known pulse frequencies for PSRs J0024−7204G
and Q (indicated by the vertical green lines). The black line
is the mean of the power in all the observation segments.
PSR J0024−7204G is clearly visible in the mean values, but
Q is not. This is because the ﬂux density of Q varies signiﬁ-
cantly (likely to be caused by scintillation) and so the mean
ﬂux density is low. In constrast, both pulsars are easily de-
tectable in either the maximum power value or the standard
deviation (the blue and red lines respectively). Note that Q
is in a binary system and so the signal is spread over multiple
spectral channels.

Unfortunately,

the statistical behaviours of

radio-
frequency-interferences (RFIs) can and do mimic those of
pulsars. To weed out spurious signals caused by RFIs, we
inspected by eye the zero-DM spectrum (having not been
de-dispersed) corresponding to each candidate. Note that if
we ﬁlter the spectra in order to only display frequency chan-
nels corresponding to pulse periods longer than 0.5 ms then
we must inspect 1342173 channels. If we show 4096 channels
simultaneously then we require that 328 ﬁgures are inspected
for pulsar candidates. This can easily be carried out by eye
by a single person. We recorded, as possible candidates, only
those signals without counterparts in the zero-DM spectrum.

3 RESULTS

Our segmented search re-detected all the known pulsars in
47 Tucanae except for P, R, V and W, which were missed by
both procedures. These undetected pulsars are not only ex-
tremely faint, but also very accelerated. This latter condition
causes their signals to be signiﬁcantly spread in the Fourier
domain. More details of those pulsars will be presented by
Ridolﬁ et al. (in preparation) who used signiﬁcantly more
observations than those available to us. Other four pulsars
(S, T, U and Y) were only missed by our PRESTO accelera-
tion search. Missing these pulsars was due to our candidate
selection settings. In fact, the spin frequencies of pulsars S,
T, U and Y were detected only 5, 10, 14 and 12 times, re-
spectively, in all the PRESTO acceleration search result for
the 820 original data ﬁles and were ignored as occasional
RFIs.

Inspecting signals from the segmented search result led
to 28 candidates from the mean power spectra, 392 from
the maximum values, and 131 from the standard deviations.
Conﬁrming these candidates is challenging. Traditionally a
further observation is carried out to try to re-detect the
candidate. However, the segmented search method made
use of ∼1100 hr of observations - this cannot easily be re-
produced. To conﬁrm or deny our candidates, we therefore
folded each individual data set using prepfold around the
candidate period, allowing a search in pulse period to max-
imise the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting proﬁle. We
then searched for multiple observations that exhibited pro-
ﬁles with similar shape and, where possible, attempted to
obtain a phase-connected timing solution. This process re-
moved all but one of our segmented-search pulsar candi-
dates.

We then inspected the PRESTO acceleration search
method results, and found 1134 candidates in total. These
candidates were inspected by eye. Among the 1134 candi-
dates, 908 candidates were identiﬁed as RFI signals from
their narrow band and/or zero-DM feature(s) and 46 candi-
dates were signals from known pulsars. The remainders were
inspected by eye in more detail, and only two of these candi-

dates were considered of suﬃcient quality for further investi-
gation. One of these corresponded to the same candidate as
that found by the segmented search method. Hereafter we
label this pulsar as PSR J0024−7204aa. We label the other
detection as PSR J0024−7204ab. We carefully checked to see
whether the pulse frequency for the new pulsars were har-
monically related to the known pulsars in the cluster, but
were unable to ﬁnd any such match. Figure 2 shows the av-
eraged proﬁles and phase-time plots of the discovery ﬁgures
in which we found the two new pulsars.

3.1 PSR J0024−7204aa

To date, we have been unable to obtain a timing solution
for this pulsar, but have clearly detected it in 12 of the orig-
inal data ﬁles. This pulsar was detected by the PRESTO
pipeline without exhibiting any evidence that it is acceler-
ating. Therefore, it is unlikely to be in a fast binary system.
It has a pulse period of ∼1.84 ms, which is shorter than the
rotational periods of any other known pulsars in the cluster.
Its dispersion measure, determined by measuring pulse ar-
rival times in diﬀerent sub-bands of the brightest three avail-
able detections, is 24.971(7) cm−3 pc, which is currently the
highest in the cluster.

3.2 PSR J0024−7204ab

Similar to PSR J0024−7204aa, the dispersion measure was
obtained by extracting TOAs from diﬀerent sub-bands from
the brightest detections (six, in this case). We have then
successfully obtained a timing solution using all the avail-
able data for PSR J0024−7204ab. The TEMPO2 (see e.g.,
Hobbs, Edwards & Manchester 2006) solution is tabulated
in Table 1. The phase-connected timing residuals using this
timing model are shown in Figure 3. Adding all the 87 de-
tections, we obtained the pulse proﬁle of this pulsar (see

possible third peak at phase 0.9. The phase connected pulse
arrival times allowed us to determine the position of the
pulsar. This is shown, in relation to the other pulsars in the
cluster, in Figure 5. The pulsar is clearly associated and sit-
uated in the central region of 47 Tucanae. Its proper motion
is consistent with the global proper motion of the cluster as
reported by Freire et al. (2003).

pulsars and discovered two new millisecond pulsars. The
two methods have diﬀerent characteristics and can be com-
plementary to each other. The traditional, PRESTO based
method detected both of the new pulsars, but also led to a
large number of false candidates. It also requires setting up
processing pipelines, selecting the parameters for the search
and was relatively slow. The new, segmented search, only
detected one of the new pulsars (aa). The missing pulsar
(ab) is weak and the segmented method subdivided the data
into such short intervals that the signal-to-noise ratio of the
pulsed signal was < 1 in each segment. However, the seg-
mented search method easily detected relatively bright pul-
sars that are not in fast binaries without a large number
of false candidates. As both methods are relatively straight-
forward, we recommend using them both in future analyses
of such data sets.

The two new discoveries add to the growing population
of pulsars in globular clusters. These two new pulsars are
weak and only occasionally observable in the Parkes data

will be able to make regular observations of these new pul-
