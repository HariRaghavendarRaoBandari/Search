(Dated: March 15, 2016)

Pulsed ESR experiments are reported for ensembles of negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy cen-
ters (NV−) in diamonds at X-band magnetic ﬁelds (280-400 mT) and low temperatures (2-70 K).
The NV− centers in synthetic type IIb diamonds (nitrogen impurity concentration < 1 ppm) are
prepared with bulk concentrations of 2 · 1013 cm−3 to 4 · 1014 cm−3 by high-energy electron irradi-
ation and subsequent annealing. We ﬁnd that a proper post-radiation anneal (1000◦C for 60 mins)
is critically important to repair the radiation damage and to recover long electron spin coherence
times for NV−s. After the annealing, spin coherence times of T2 = 0.74 ms at 5 K are achieved,
being only limited by 13C nuclear spectral diﬀusion in natural abundance diamonds. At X-band
magnetic ﬁelds, strong electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) is observed originating
from the central 14N nucleus. The ESEEM spectral analysis allows for accurate determination of
the 14N nuclear hypeﬁne and quadrupole tensors. In addition, the ESEEM eﬀects from two proximal
13C sites (second-nearest neighbor and fourth-nearest neighbor) are resolved and the respective 13C
hyperﬁne coupling constants are extracted.

INTRODUCTION

Nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV−) in diamond are a type
of point defect that have been widely studied for their
spin dependent optical cycle1,
long spin coherence at
room temperature2, and sensitivity to small ﬂuctuations
in magnetic3,4 and electric ﬁelds3,5. They are presently
a leading candidate for nanoscale magnetometry6,7 and
oﬀer a promising platform for quantum computation8.
Coherent manipulation of single spins has been demon-
strated by several groups4,9 and coherent information
transfer with the central 14N nucleus and nearby 13C
has been achieved9,10. Accurate control of the electron
and nuclear spins requires the precise determination of
the static spin Hamiltonian of the NV− and also un-
derstanding the environmental contributions to the spin
decoherence rates.
In the ﬁrst part of this manuscript
we characterize electron spin coherence times at X-band
magnetic ﬁelds. We observe a strong eﬀect of damage
from electron irradiation on T2 and show that appropri-
ate annealing recovers a long T2 = 0.74 ms limited by
13C spectral diﬀusion. In the second part we report the
electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) aris-
ing from the central 14N nucleus and deduce an accurate
estimate of the 14N hyperﬁne and quadrupole tensors.
The ESEEM eﬀects from two proximal 13C sites are also
resolved and the hyperﬁne couplings are derived.

Several mechanisms of NV− spin decoherence have
been identiﬁed. In high purity natural diamond the elec-
tron spin decoherence is set by spectral diﬀusion from the
1.1% natural abundance of 13C nuclei and decoherence
times T2 = 0.6 ms have been observed for both single
spins and ensembles of NV− at room temperature11,12.
The decoherence times were reported to be much shorter

in heavily doped diamonds (nitrogen impurity, P1 cen-
ter concentration ∼100 ppm) being limited by spectral
diﬀusion from nitrogen impurities13. Damage from high
energy processing techniques, like ion implantation, has
been observed to drastically increase decoherence rates
but can be repaired through proper high temperature
annealing14,15. Here we ﬁnd that leftover damage from
mild electron irradiation can also produce a strong ef-
fect on NV− decoherence rates and we suggest an an-
nealing recipe which repairs this damage, restoring long
T2 = 0.74 ms, limited by the 13C nuclear ﬂip-ﬂops. Pre-
vious T2 measurements were made at low magnetic ﬁeld
(< 10 mT) where strong ESEEM from distant 13C nu-
clei complicates the T2 analysis9,11,16. Here we use X-
band magnetic ﬁelds where the distant 13C ESEEM is
suppressed, allowing for accurate T2 measurements and
helping to resolve the radiation damage eﬀects.

Weak ESEEM arising from the central 14N nucleus in
NV− has recently been reported from ODMR experi-
ments at low magnetic ﬁelds (< 20 mT).17 We ﬁnd that
the 14N modulation is strongly enhanced at X-band mag-
netic ﬁelds (280-400 mT), allowing accurate determina-
tion of the nitrogen hyperﬁne and quadrupole tensors.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Four diamond samples were used in our experiments
(Table I). All four are synthetic type IIb diamonds (El-
ementSix, CVD grown, P2 grade, [N] < 1 ppm), with
a concentration of NV− centers in the pristine material
less than 1013 cm−3 (below the detectable limit in our
experiments). The samples were irradiated with elec-
trons at 2 MeV energy, receiving a dose of 1015 cm−2

(Sample A) and 1017 cm−2 (Samples B, C, and D). All
samples were then annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere at
900◦C for 20 minutes. Samples C and D received an ad-
ditional anneal in forming gas at 1000◦C for 60 minutes.
Resulting concentrations of NV− centers in each sample
were determined by comparing the ESR signal intensity
to a standard sample with a known spin concentration
(Table I). Samples C and D received the identical ra-
diation/annealing treatment and have the same concen-
tration of NV− centers; the only diﬀerence between these
two samples is their orientation (cut edges along {100} in
sample C versus {110} in sample D) that allows diﬀerent
orientations of the crystals with respect to the external
magnetic ﬁeld in the ESR resonator.

X-band (9.6 GHz) pulsed ESR experiments were
performed with a Bruker ESR spectrometer (Elexsys
E580) using a dielectric resonator (ER-4118X-MD5) in
a helium-ﬂow cryostat (Oxford CF935). In most of the
experiments a standard two-pulse (Hahn) echo pulse se-
quence (π/2 − τ − π − τ −echo) was used with π/2 and π
pulses set to be 50 ns and 100 ns.

A frequency-doubled YLF laser (Spectra Physics,
TFR-104Q-10), operating at 523 nm, was used for optical
spin polarization of the NV− centers. This Q-switched
laser supplies 7 ns pulses with 200 µJ per pulse at a 4 kHz
repetition rate. The laser pulses were transmitted to the
diamond samples inside the cold cryostat through a 4 mm
diameter quartz rod used as an optical waveguide. Typ-
ically between 10 to 100 laser pulses were suﬃcient to
achieve steady-state spin polarization of the NV− cen-
ters in our experiments.

All ESR and ESEEM simulations discussed in this
work were performed using the EasySpin toolbox devel-
oped for Matlab18.

ESR SPECTRA OF NV− CENTERS AT

X-BAND

ESR experiments were performed at three crystal ori-
entations, with the external magnetic ﬁeld (B0) oriented
closely along the [001], [110] and [111] axes of the di-
amond crystals. Fig. 1 shows an example of the ESR
spectrum measured for Sample C when the magnetic ﬁeld
(B0) is oriented along [110]. Eight ESR peaks, labeled
as S±
in Fig. 1, correspond to four non-equivalent NV−
i
crystal sites (i = 1 − 4), and the ± sign identiﬁes the
transitions between T+ ↔ T0 and T0 ↔ T− for each site.
Note that in this manuscript the spin eigenstates (T+, T0
and T−) are deﬁned in the laboratory frame with the spin
quantization (Z) axis directed along the applied B0 ﬁeld.
This laboratory frame is natural in X-band experiments
because the Zeeman interaction is the largest term in the
NV− spin-Hamiltonian, in particular it is much larger
than the zero ﬁeld splitting (ZFS) term. Our deﬁnitions
of the spin eigenstates are thus diﬀerent from those com-
monly used in low magnetic ﬁeld experiments where the
Z-axis is associated with the orientation of the ZFS prin-

2

cipal axis (the molecular frame).

In each experiment the crystal orientation was deter-
mined with sub-degree accuracy by ﬁtting the measured
positions of all eight NV− ESR peaks using the spin
Hamiltonian:

ˆH0 = µBB0ˆgS + S ˆDS,

(1)

where µB is a Bohr magneton, and S is an electron
spin (S= 1) vector operator.
In simulations we as-
sumed the ZFS tensor ( ˆD) to be axial with D = 2.873
GHz and the electron g-tensor (ˆg) to be isotropic with
g = 2.0030 as expected for the C3v symmetry of NV−.19
Thus, from the ESR peak position simulations in Fig. 1
we determined that the magnetic ﬁeld vector (B0) was
slightly misaligned from the intended [110] by (α, β, γ) =
(2, 2.2, 0) degrees where the three angles are Euler rota-
tions (ZYZ) from [110].

Positive (emission) and negative (absorption) ampli-
tudes of the ESR peaks in Fig. 1 reﬂect non-thermal
triplet state populations after optical pumping. Four
non-equivalent NV− crystal sites can be subdivided into
two groups. Two sites (1 and 2) show positive S+
i peaks
and negative S−
i peaks indicating a preferential T0 state
population during the optical pumping. Two other sites
(3 and 4) show the opposite signs of the S±
i peaks reveal-
ing a preferential T± state’s population. This preferential
T± state population is in stark contrast to the previously
reported preferential T0 state population as observed in
low magnetic ﬁeld experiments (B0 < 50 mT).20 We ﬁnd
that at X-band magnetic ﬁelds (B0 = 200 − 400 mT)
the optically-induced triplet state population strongly
depends on the orientation of B0 with respect to the prin-
cipal ZFS axis of NV− (associated with the N-V bond
direction). Two NV− sites (1 and 2) in Fig. 1 have their
principal ZFS axes oriented at a 90 degree angle with re-
spect to B0 and therefore preferential T0 state population
during optical pumping. The two other sites (3 and 4)
have their angle at approximately 35 degrees and prefer-
ential T± state population. Further details of the B0 ori-
entation and magnitude dependence for laser optical po-
larization in NV− centers will be published separately.21

ELECTRON SPIN COHERENCE OF NV−

Two-pulse Hahn echo experiments were performed to
measure NV− electron spin coherence times in Samples
A–D covering the temperature range 2-70 K. Figure 2
presents the results for three samples A–C measured
at magnetic ﬁeld orientation B0 k [110] (Sample D is
not shown but it gave results similar to Sample C). Se-
lected experiments were also performed at B0 k [001] and
B0 k [111] resulting in the same coherence times within
experimental errors.
In all samples, and over the full
temperature range, the decays were non-exponential as
illustrated for Sample C in Fig. 2(A). The decays can be
ﬁt using

V (2τ ) = A · exp (− (2τ /T2)n) ,

A. NV− Decoherence due to 13C Nuclear Spin

Flip-Flops

We start our discussion with Samples A and C where
we ﬁnd T2 and n to be independent of temperature
(less than 20% variation) throughout the measured range
5 – 25 K and 5 – 45 K, respectively. The measured
T2 = 0.7 ms are comparable in both samples, however
the exponent, n, is substantially smaller in Sample C.
Three temperature-independent mechanisms are poten-
tially responsible for NV− decoherence in these samples:
(1) instantaneous diﬀusion due to π-pulse induced elec-
tron spin ﬂips of nearby NV− centers,22,23 (2) spectral
diﬀusion due to ﬂip-ﬂopping dipolar ﬁelds from other
paramagnetic defects (mostly substitutional nitrogen P1
centers),13,24 and (3) spectral diﬀusion due to 13C nuclear
spin ﬂip-ﬂops.11,25 The ﬁrst mechanism (instantaneous
diﬀusion) can immediately be excluded after recognizing
that T2 in Sample C is comparable to that in Sample A
even though the NV− concentration in Sample C is 20
times larger than in Sample A. An instantaneous diﬀu-
sion decoherence rate (1/T2) should scale proportionally
with NV− concentration,23 and therefore T2 should be
20 times as short in Sample C as compared to Sample A
if it was limited by instantaneous diﬀusion.

The second mechanism (spectral diﬀusion from P1 cen-
ter ﬂip-ﬂops) has been observed to be a dominant source
of NV− decoherence in highly-doped diamond samples
(20–200 ppm of nitrogen impurities), often limiting T2
to a microsecond timescale.13,26 However, this mecha-
nism is less important in our samples because of their
smaller P1 concentrations (0.1 ppm). A rough estimate
of the expected contribution from this mechanism can
be made using simulated results in diamond with high
P1 concentrations (1–100 ppm)13 and extrapolating to
our 0.1 ppm concentration. In addition, we have to take
into account the inhomogeneous broadening of P1 ESR
transitions (∼ 300 kHz) due to 13C hyperﬁne interac-
tions in natural diamonds.27 The inhomogeneous broad-
ening detunes the P1’s from one another in a highly lo-
calized uncorrelated manner limiting the number of res-

FIG. 2. (Color online) (A) A two-pulse (Hahn) echo decay of

The ESR peak at B0 = 390 mT, marked as S+

1, was used in this experiment. The red solid curve is a ﬁt
using Eq. (2) with T2 = 0.74 ± 0.01 ms and n = 1.45 ± 0.02.

compared to Sample A. Subsequent annealing in forming gas
at 1000◦C for 60 minutes (Sample C) repairs the radiation
damage and restores T2 back to the level seen in Sample A.

onant ﬂip-ﬂopping pairs.28 For our [P1] = 0.1 ppm, we
estimate the average dipole-dipole coupling between P1
spins in pairs to be ∼ 1 kHz which is 300 times smaller
than the spin detuning from the inhomogeneous broad-
ening so that only 1/300th of the total number of pairs
are allowed to ﬂip-ﬂop. The direct extrapolation from
the results in Takahashi et al. 13 to our P1 concentration
0.1 ppm gives T2 = 200 µs, and after accounting for the
inhomogeneous broadening we estimate the contribution
from P1 spin ﬂip-ﬂops to NV− decoherence in our sample
to be only T2 = 60 ms. This T2 is much longer than the

4

0.74 ms measured in our experiments.

The eﬀect of 13C nuclear spin ﬂip-ﬂops on NV− de-
coherence in natural diamonds (1.1% of 13C isotopes
with I = 1/2) has already been studied using low-ﬁeld,
room-temperature ODMR experiments for single spins
as well as ensembles of spins, and T2 = 0.63 ms was
reported11,25. Their T2 is slightly shorter but is simi-
lar to the 0.74 ms we measure in Samples A and C at
high magnetic ﬁelds 280-400 mT and low temperatures
5-25 K. We speculate that in both cases T2 is dominated
by spectral diﬀusion from 13C nuclear spin ﬂip-ﬂops and
that this decoherence process is both temperature and
ﬁeld independent, as expected. The measured n=1.75 in
Sample A is close to 2 as expected for nuclear-induced
spectral diﬀusion.29 Note that for Sample C, n= 1.4 is
noticeably smaller than 2, indicating a contribution from
some other (unidentiﬁed) mechanism, possibly related to
the mechanism discussed in the next section for Sample
B. T2 is slightly shorter in the low-ﬁeld ODMR experi-
ments which could be due to residual interference from
13C modulation even at the [111] ﬁeld orientation11,25,30.
We note that in our experiments, at higher magnetic
ﬁelds (280-400 mT), the 13C ESEEM eﬀects from distant
nuclei are fully suppressed at all ﬁeld orientations and we
observe no orientation dependence in T2 in contrast to
the low ﬁeld ODMR experiments.

B. Eﬀect of Electron Irradiation Damage and
Post-Radiation Annealing on NV− Decoherence

Sample B in Fig. 2(B) shows a distinctly diﬀerent
temperature dependence of T2 from Samples A and C.
At high and low temperatures, T2 approaches 0.7 ms,
close to that in Samples A and C. However, T2 drops
down at intermediate temperatures reaching a minimum
of 0.45 ms (a 35% reduction) at around 15 K. This type
of T2 temperature dependence has been observed in sit-
uations where thermally activated electric or magnetic
ﬁeld noise dominates spin relaxation.31–33 As tempera-
ture decreases the characteristic time of this noise (τc)
increases, making a transition from a motional narrowing
regime (τc ≪ T2) at high temperatures to a slow spec-
tral diﬀusion regime (τc ≫ T2) at low temperatures. The
eﬀect of noise is minimal in these two extreme regimes
(therefore long T2), however the eﬀect on T2 can become
signiﬁcant in the intermediate regime when τc ∼ T2.

The change in τc occurs over a relatively narrow tem-
perature range (5–25 K) suggesting a thermally activated
process. While the nature of defect sites remain un-
known, if we assume a process inhibited by a single en-
ergy barrier, e.g. 1/τc ∼ exp(−Ea/kT ), the temperature
dependence of T2 for Sample B gives an estimate of the
activation energy to be Ea = 2.5 meV and a density of
magnetic ﬂuctuators to be 2.7·1016 cm−3 as shown in Fig.
2(B) (dashed red line). Alternatively, the source of this
decohering noise can be electric in origin. Electric ﬁeld
noise from charge ﬂuctuators modulates the ZFS of the

NV− through a Stark shift, contributing to dephasing.

Sample B received a 100× higher electron dose than
Sample A, resulting in a much higher density of damage-
induced defects. The 20 minute anneal at 900◦C, was
suﬃcient for repairing most of the damage defects in
Sample A, but was not suﬃcient for Sample B. A longer
anneal (60 minutes) at a higher temperature (1000◦C)
was required in order to repair the excess radiation dam-
age. This is conﬁrmed by the observed recovery of T2
in Sample C which was otherwise prepared the same as
Sample B.

Similar reduction in T2 was observed for NV− after
high-energy ion implantation, with longer T2 recovered
after subsequent high temperature anneals.14,15 It was
argued that paramagnetic vacancy clusters are primarily
responsible for short T2 of NV−s in the pre-annealed di-
amonds and that concentration of these vacancy clusters
can be greatly reduced by annealing at 1000◦C.

Despite the 100× higher radiation dose, Sample B
shows only a 2.5× increase in the number of NV− centers
compared to Sample A. Annealing the sample longer at
higher temperature further mobilizes vacancies allowing
them to be trapped by substitutional nitrogen resulting
in a higher concentration of NV− centers in Sample C.
The ﬁnal annealing of Sample C resulted in an 8× in-
crease in NV− concentration compared to Sample B, and
a total of 20× increase in density compared to sample A.
To conclude, when fabricating NV− rich diamond via
electron irradiation, the subsequent annealing step is of
critical importance in order to achieve a high density of
NV− centers and also to avoid additional spin decoher-
ence.

V.

14N NUCLEAR MODULATION EFFECTS IN

NV−

While measuring two-pulse (Hahn) echo decays we ob-
served strong nuclear modulation eﬀects (ESEEM),34 su-
perimposed on the decays. The modulated echo signals
and their respective Fourier-Transform (FT) spectra are
shown in Figs. 3-4. The modulation eﬀects are most
pronounced when measuring the S−
1-4 transitions (the
T− ↔ T0 transitions) with the magnetic ﬁeld oriented
along [001] (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the modula-
tion eﬀects are strongly suppressed for the S+
3,4 transi-
tions (T0 ↔ T+) with the magnetic ﬁeld oriented along
[110] (it is more clearly seen in the time-domain traces
shown in Fig. 5 in Appendix). When B0 k [111], the 14N
modulation is completely suppressed on both S±
1 tran-
sitions for the NV− centers whose symmetry axis is di-
rected along the magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 4). At this ﬁeld
orientation, a weak 13C modulation is observed result-
ing from proximal 13C nuclear spins as further discussed
in Sec. VI. The transitions with minimum modulation
eﬀects were used in our T2 measurements in Sec. IV A
in order to minimize the distortion of the measured T2
times.

i and ν+

The Fourier transform spectra (FT-ESEEM) in Fig. 3B
are straightforward to interpret. The peaks with positive
amplitudes, known as ’basic’ ESEEM harmonics, arise
from 14N nuclear spin transitions within the two corre-
sponding electron spin manifolds being driven. For ex-
ample, the FT-ESEEM spectrum measured while driving
the T− ↔ T0 transition in Fig. 3B(top) reveals the nu-
clear spin transitions within the T− and T0 electronic spin
manifolds. The ESEEM peaks here are labeled ν−
i and ν 0
i
(i = 1..3). Similarily, in the second from top spectrum
in Fig. 3B, the nuclear spin transitions are within the
T0 and T+ electron spin manifolds (labeled ν 0
i ).
Within each group the three nuclear spin transitions sat-
isfy the additive relationship, νj
3, as expected
for the three transitions between nuclear spin states of
I = 1. Finally, the ESEEM peaks with negative ampli-
tudes, known as ’combination’ ESEEM harmonics, are
sum and diﬀerence combinations of the basic harmonics.
The FT-ESEEM spectra measured at B0 k [110] (two
bottom spectra in Fig. 3B) show fewer basic harmonics
(only one harmonic for each T0,± state involved). Some
electron-nuclear ﬂip-ﬂop transitions (known as forbidden
or branching transitions)34,35 are forbidden at this ﬁeld
orientation which explains the smaller number of har-
monics and also the shallower 14N modulation. When
B0 k [111] (Fig. 4), the branching transitions are com-
pletely forbidden for NV− centers whose symmetry axis
is parallel to B0. These speciﬁc NV− centers have their
(axial) hyperﬁne and quadrupolar tensors directed along
B0, and therefore the C3v symmetry of the NV− site is
preserved even with the ﬁeld applied. In this situation
the 14N nuclear eigenstates are the same for all three
T0,± electron spin states, and therefore nuclear spin state
branching when applying a π pulse in a Hahn echo is for-
bidden and no 14N modulation eﬀects are observed.34,35
We simulate the 14N ESEEM eﬀects using the following

spin Hamiltonian:

ˆH0 = µBB0ˆgS + S ˆDS + S ˆAI + I ˆQI − gnµnB0I.

(3)

In addition to the electron Zeeman and ZFS terms needed
to describe ESR transitions, we include here the nuclear
hyperﬁne coupling ( ˆA), nuclear quadrupole coupling ( ˆQ),
and the nuclear Zeeman terms (gn and µn are the nuclear
g-factor and the nuclear magneton, respectively). The
hyperﬁne and nuclear quadrupolar tensors are assumed
to be axial, and both tensors and also the ZFS tensor are
assumed to be coaxial with the principal axes directed
along the N−V bond. The latter is required by the C3v
symmetry of the NV− defect.

In each ESEEM experiment the orientation of the mag-
netic ﬁeld (B0) with respect to the crystal axes was deter-
mined by simulations of the observed ESR peak positions
(similar to the ﬁts shown in Fig. 1). In terms of three

nucleus, and q is the electric ﬁeld gradient at the nucleus. The
rhombicity parameter η was assumed to be zero for an axially
symmetric nuclear quadrupole tensor of NV− center.

B0 k [100] and [110]. Both the peak positions and am-
plitudes in the FT spectra as well as the modulation fea-
tures observed in the time-domain traces (Fig. 5 in Ap-
pendix) are clearly reproduced. The simulations produce
slightly larger modulation amplitudes than experiment,
especially for the high-frequency ESEEM peaks, because
they do not take into account the limited detection band-
width used in our experiments (the bandwidth was set by
a 100 ns integration window). The simulation also show
no 14N modulation at B0 k [111] for the NV− sites with
their axis parallel to B0 as observed in the experiment
(Figs. 4).

The extracted 14N hyperﬁne and nuclear quadrupole
parameters are summarized in Table II, where they
are also compared with the previous results from the
ESR/ENDOR experiments.
Our parameters agree
closely with those reported by Felton et al.,19 however
we signiﬁcantly improve on the accuracy of the parame-
ters due to the high resolution of our FT-ESEEM spectra
as compared to their ESR/ENDOR spectra. Our param-
eter errors reported in Table II are dominated by errors
in orienting the crystals during the experiments.

Nuclear modulation eﬀects are expected to be greatly
enhanced when the cancellation condition is met.34,35 In
the case of NV− (S = 1 and I = 1), this condition occurs
when |νI −mSA| < |Q|, which is when the Zeeman energy
(νI = gnµnB0) is approximately canceled by the hyper-
ﬁne energy (A) for one of the electron spin projections
mS. For a 14N hyperﬁne coupling of A ∼ −2 MHz for
NV− (Table II) this condition is met when B0 ∼ 350 mT
for the T− state (mS = −1). This ﬁeld is close to the
ﬁelds used in our [001] experiments which explains the
deep modulation (modulation depth ∼ 95%) observed
for the T− ↔ T0 transitions (S−
1,4 in Fig. 3, top spec-
trum). Somewhat weaker modulation (modulation depth
∼ 20−50%) observed for the T+ ↔ T0 transitions (S+
2,3 in
Fig. 3, second top spectrum) and also for both T± ↔ T0
transitions at [110] (S±
in Fig. 3, two bottom spectra)
i
is explained by B0 being further away from the cancel-

7

lation condition. Weak modulation from the central 14N
nucleus in NV− has been recently reported in low-ﬁeld
ODMR experiments17. The 14N modulation was weak
with modulation depth ∼ 3% in those experiments be-
cause the magnetic ﬁeld (B0 = 7.5 mT) was far away from
the cancellation condition. The Fourier spectral com-
ponents were diﬃcult to resolve accurately under these
conditions.

VI. NUCLEAR MODULATION EFFECTS

FROM PROXIMAL 13C NUCLEI IN NV−

The ESEEM eﬀects resulting from hyperﬁne in-
teractions with 13C nuclear spins have been previ-
ously reported for NV− centers in natural diamonds
in ODMR experiments at low magnetic ﬁelds (B0 <
20 mT).11,16,25,37 At these ﬁelds the modulation eﬀects
were shown to be due to distant 13C nuclear spins rang-
ing from 0.5-1.6 nm (4-10 lattice sites away) from the
NV− center.37 These distant 13C modulation eﬀects are
completely suppressed in our X-band experiments (B0 =
280 − 400 mT) because the weak hyperﬁne couplings to
distant 13C spins (A < 0.1 MHz) are now far from the
cancellation condition. We note that in the case of an
electron spin S = 1 and a 13C nuclear spin I = 1/2,
the cancellation condition occurs when |νI − mSA| < T,
where T is an anisotropic part of the 13C hyperﬁne
coupling.34,35

In our strong magnetic ﬁelds (B0 = 280 − 400 mT)
the cancellation condition is met for the proximal 13C
spins as evidenced by the modulation eﬀects in Fig. 4.
The peaks in the FT spectra Fig. 4B are labeled with
ν 0,± identifying the related electron spin states mS =
0, ±1. In each spectrum the peaks ν 0 appear at exactly
the 13C nuclear Zeeman frequency (νI = gnµnB0), and
the peaks ν± = |νI ∓A| are shifted away by the hyperﬁne
coupling. Thus, the hyperﬁne coupling constants for the
proximal 13C spins can immediately be estimated from
the observed peak positions. From the top spectrum in
Fig. 4 we estimate A1 = 2.56(2) or 2.92(2) MHz, where
two values are possible because of the uncertainty in the
sign of (νI ∓A1). From the bottom spectrum, we estimate
A2 = −2.88(4) or −6.70(4) MHz. The two estimated
hyperﬁne coupling constants (A1 and A2) are diﬀerent
in both magnitude and sign, indicating that they must
belong to two distinct 13C lattice sites in close proximity
to the NV− center.

Hyperﬁne coupling constants for several 13C lattice
sites around the NV− have recently been reported in
low-ﬁeld ODMR experiments and assigned to speciﬁc
sites using density functional theory calculations.38–40
Our A1 = 2.56 MHz agrees well with their 2.54 MHz
measured for one of the fourth nearest-neighbor lattice
sites (”Site G” according to the notation introduced in
Ref. [39]), while our A2 = −6.7 MHz is close to their
-6.55 MHz measured for a second nearest-neighbor site
(”Site D”). Each of these sites (”G” and ”D”) involves six

1 transitions of NV−
The traces shown are for the S+
defects whose symmetry axis (the N−V bond) is oriented par-
allel to the applied magnetic ﬁeld B0. 14N modulation eﬀects
are suppressed at this ﬁeld orientation because of the C3v
symmetry of NV− defects. Instead, a weak 13C modulation is
resolved arising from carbon nuclear spins located at the sec-
ond and fourth nearest-neighbor lattice sites around NV−’s.
The 13C peaks are labeled with ν 0,± in accordance with their

equivalent (symmetry-related) lattice positions around
the NV−. Therefore, even though the isotopic abundance
of 13C is only 1.07%, the probability of having at least
one 13C isotope at one of the six equivalent positions is
6.4%. This enhanced probability and also closeness to
the cancellation conditions explains the deep 13C modu-
lation from Site G as seen in Fig. 4A.

VII. CONCLUSION

In summary, we report on electron spin coherence mea-
surements of ensembles of NV− centers in diamond at
X-band magnetic ﬁelds and low temperatures (< 70 K).
High energy electron irradiation (to generate vacancies)
and subsequent annealing (to diﬀuse vacancies) was used
to produce NV− centers in synthetic type IIb diamonds
with a nitrogen impurity concentration less than 1 ppm.
We show that the annealing step is critical in order to
achieve a high yield of NV− centers and also to re-
pair residual damage due to the electron irradiation.

8

Insuﬃcient annealing (900◦C for 20 mins) leaves unre-
paired damage behind resulting in faster spin decoher-
ence for NV−. From the temperature dependence of
this damage-related decoherence process, and assuming
a simple thermally-activated noise model, we deduce a
characteristic activation energy of 2.5 meV and density
of 2.7·1016cm−3 for the residual damage defects. We ﬁnd
that a higher temperature anneal (1000◦C for 60 mins)
repairs the damage and removes the additional decoher-
ence. In the properly annealed diamonds T2 = 0.74 ms
at 5 K and is independent of ﬁeld orientation, limited
by spectral diﬀusion from a natural abundance 1.1% of
13C nuclear spins. This is evidenced by an exponential
stretch factor close to 2 in the NV− decoherence decays.
A strong ESEEM from distant 13C nuclei (> 0.5 nm)
is observed in low-ﬁeld ODMR experiments11,16,25,37, but
is fully suppressed at our X-band magnetic ﬁelds (280-
400 mT). Instead a strong ESEEM arising from the cen-
tral 14N nucleus is observed. By assuming complete C3v
symmetry for NV−, we can extract accurate 14N nuclear
quadrupole and hyperﬁne tensors. With the magnetic
ﬁeld aligned along the symmetry axis the 14N modulation
vanishes and instead we observe a modulation from prox-
imal 13C sites (identiﬁed as 0.3 and 0.5 nm away from the
NV−), consistent with previous low-ﬁeld ODMR experi-
ments and density functional theory calculations.38–40

Appendix A: Time-Domain Traces for 14N ESEEM

in NV−

The depth of 14N ESEEM modulation for NV− varies
strongly as a function of magnetic ﬁeld strength, orien-
tation, and also depends on the excited ESR transition
as seen in the time-domain traces in Fig. 5. These depth
variations reﬂect the C3v symmetry of the NV− center
with the symmetry axis directed along [111]. The mod-
ulation depth across several orientations and transitions
is accurately reproduced in our simulations, conﬁrming
the model of Eq. 3.

When normalized to the overall relaxation decay (e.g.
T2 decay), the 14N modulation is visible for hundreds of
microseconds showing no sign of modulation damping. In
ensemble experiments, a distribution of hyperﬁne or nu-
clear quadrupolar coupling parameters between the spins
usually results in modulation damping. The absence of
modulation damping for the case of NV− is indicative of
a very narrow distribution of the parameters. From the

observed window we can estimate that δA/A < 0.2% and

δQ/Q < 1% for NV− centers in our samples.
