ABSTRACT
The bipolar-hyper shell (BHS) model for the North Polar Spurs (NPS-E, -W, and Loop
I) and counter southern spurs (SPS-E and -W) is revisited based on numerical hydro-
dynamical simulations. Propagations of shock waves produced by energetic explosive
events in the Galactic Center are examined. Distributions of soft X-ray brightness
on the sky at 0.25, 0.7, and 1.5 keV in a ±50◦ × ±50◦ region around the Galactic
Center are modeled by thermal emission from high-temperature plasma in the shock-
compressed shell considering shadowing by the interstellar HI and H2 gases. The result
is compared with the ROSAT wide ﬁeld X-ray images in R2, 4 and 6 bands. The NPS
and southern spurs are well reproduced by the simulation as shadowed dumbbell-
shaped shock waves. We discuss the origin and energetics of the event in relation to
the starburst and/or AGN activities in the Galactic Center.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear activities in spiral galaxies are evidenced by a vari-
ety of ejection phenomena such as jets, rings, lobes, winds
and shells of diﬀerent morphologies and scales from sub par-
secs to several tens of kpc, which include those in the Milky
Way. (e.g., Oort 1977; Sofue 2000). The discovery of the
Fermi Bubble (Su et al. 2010) has stimulated further dis-
cussions of the outﬂow activity in the Galactic Center. The
origin and physical properties have been investigated in re-
lation to the associated X-ray features including the North
Polar Spur (NPS) (Totani 2006; Fujita et al. 2013; Kataoka
et al. 2013, 2015; Ackermann et al. 2014; Mou et al. 2014;
Fang and Jiang 2014; Carretti et al. 2013; Crocker et al.
2015; Inoue et al. 2015; Tahara et al. 2015; Sarkar et al.
2015).

The largest scale Galactic Center (GC) phenomenon so
far reported in the Milky Way is the bipolar hyper shells
(BHS) with an extent of several kpc and total energy on
the order of 1055 ∼ 1056 ergs (Sofue 1977, 1984, 1994, 2000;
Bland-Hawthorn and Cohen 2003)), which is observed as
the North Polar Spur (NPS) and its counter spurs extending

over ∼ 120◦ on the sky in radio continuum (Haslam et al.
1982) and X-ray emissions (Snowden et al. 1997).
In our BHS model (Sofue 2000) the giant spurs were in-
terpreted as due to a dumbbell-shaped shock front induced
by an explosive event at the Galactic Center t ∼ 15 Myr
ago with total energy of E ∼ 1055 ergs. In the present pa-
per, we revisit the BHS model by performing a numerical
hydrodynamic simulation of a shock wave driven by high-
rate energy injection into the Galactic Center. We simulate
soft X-ray distributions and compare them with the ROSAT
all-sky maps taking account of shadowing by the interstellar
matter.

As to the energy source and its transfer to the kinetic
energy of expansion of BHS, we consider the following cases
and their combination.

• SB model: Energy is released by multiple type II su-
pernovae by nuclear starbursts (SB) and is accumulated as
kinetic energy to drive a round shock wave or a wide-angle
outﬂow (Sofue 2000). The starburst requires fueling of star
forming gas to the central region.

• AGN model: Energy is released at the black hole in
the nucleus (AGN) and transformed to kinetic energy of the
surrounding gas to drive a round shock wave or an outﬂow
(Totani 2006; Mou et al. 2014).

2

Y. Sofue et al.

We also categorize the event according to the duration of
energy injection.

• C (continuous injection) type: Energy is continuously
released and injected to the Galactic Center. It may occur
intermittently by recurrent events.

• E (point explosion) type: Energy is released as a single
point-like explosive event with a short time scale in the nu-
cleus. If the duration of energy supply in the above C type
is suﬃciently shorter than the whole event life, it may be
regarded as E type.

There may be various hybrid combinations of these models
and types. In the present paper for the BHS, we consider
the SB model of C type. This scenario is almost identical to
a C type AGN model except for the required gas inﬂow in
SB model.

2 HYDRODYNAMICAL SIMULATION OF

BIPOLAR HYPER SHELLS

We have performed a numerical hydrodynamical simulation
of the BHS by computing the propagation of a shock waves
produced by an energy release at the Galactic Center, im-
plicitly considering the SB model with the C type energy
injection.

2.1 Hydrodynamical equations and simulation

code

We used a hydrodynamical code of the ﬂux-splitting method
with second-order accuracy both in space and time (van Al-
bada et al. 1982; Mair et al. 1988; Nozawa et al. 2006). This
algorithm is an upwind scheme for the Euler equations and
is well suited to solving problems involving a shock. The ra-
diative cooling of gas (T > 104 K) is included, assuming the
cooling function with the solar abundance (ﬁgure 1).

We assume that gas ﬂow is axisymmetric around the
rotation axis of the Galaxy for simplicity. We solve hydro-
dynamic equations in the cylindrical coordinate (r, z), as-
suming that the unperturbed gas in the disk and halo are
rotation-supported but the rotation is not important for evo-
lution of bipolar hyper shells.

The hydrodynamic equations of gas are given by

The viscosity, thermal conductivity and the self gravity of
the gas are neglected. The cooling function P (T ) was taken
from Raymond et al. (1976) for solar abundance as shown in
ﬁgure 1. Note that the cooling function is almost identical to
that by Foster et al. (2012) in the temperature range under
consideration.

2.2 Circumstantial and initial conditions

The gravitational potential Φ is assumed to be given by the
Miyamoto and Nagai (1975) model,

Φ(r, z) = −

GM

pr2 + (a + √z2 + b2)2

where G is the gravitational constant, M = 1011M⊙, a = 20
kpc, and b =1 kpc.

The initial gas density was assumed to have the distri-

(6)

bution represented by
ρ(r, z) = ρ1 exp(−(z/z1)2)) + ρ2(−(z/z2)) + ρ3.
Here ρ is the density, z is the height from the galactic plane,
zi is the scale thickness of the disk and halo, and r is the
distance from the rotation axis. Suﬃces 1, 2 and 3 denote
quantities representing the disk, halo and intergalactic gas,
respectively, with ρ1 = 3 × 10−24g cm−3, ρ2 = 3 × 10−26g
cm−3, and z1 and z2 are 0.1 and 1 kpc. The last term repre-
sents the intergalactic gas of density on the order of 10−29g
cm−3. The initial temperatures in the disk and halo gases
were taken to be 104 K and 2 × 106 K, respectively. The
thus settled gas distribution is in between the plane-parallel
(Yao et al. 2009; Sakai et al. 2014) and spherical (Miller and
Bregmann 2013) models for the hot halo gas distribution as
inferred from X-ray observations.

Galactic Center Hyper Shell and the North Polar Spur

The numerical simulations were performed for the two
cases, one for E type injection with a point-like explosion
at the nucleus, and the other for C type with continuous
energy injection into the Galactic Center. In both cases total
energy of E = 4× 1056 ergs was given as thermal energy into
a sphere of 50 pc radius. In the C type injection, the energy
was supplied to the volume continuously at a rate of dE /dt =
4.0× 1055 ergs Myr−1, and total energy of E = 4× 1056 ergs
in 10 Myr, where we also assumed mass supply of at a rate
of dM/dt = 1M⊙•yr−1.

The initial gas was left free in the gravitational potential
with the distribution mimicking multiple layered disks com-
posed of a low-temperature disk and high-temperature halo
by equation 6. The gas is at rest initially in the potential,
but moves slowly toward hydrostatic distribution. Since the
motion is slow, the ambient gas appears almost motionless
in contrast to the rapid shock wave propagation. The grav-
itational and hydrodynamical accelerations are included in
the equation of motion.

2.3 Metallicity and cooling

In the present simulation, the solar abundance was assumed
not only because the code was written for a ﬁxed solar abun-
dance, but also because the metallicity in the Galactic Cen-
ter and halo is not well modeled. The gas in the BHS is a
mixture of diﬀerent components with diﬀerent abundances
from extremely high to primordially low. Namely, the BHS
includes the ejected/snowplowed gas from the galactic disc
and the Galactic Center with high star formation rate and
therefore high metallicity, > Z⊙ (Uchiyama et al. 2013; Na-
jarro et al. 2009), and the halo gas for which some authors
prefer high metallicity of Z = Z⊙ (Sakai et al. 2014) but
the others prefer lower value at Z = 0.2Z⊙ (Miler et al.
2014; Kataoka et al. 2015). Also, intergalactic gas supposed
to have lower metallicity may be included.

So, we here assume solar abundance Z = 1Z⊙ as an av-
erage during the whole life of the BHS evolution. The metal-
licity inﬂuences the simulation through cooling rate. How-
ever, it is shown in section 4, that the cooling does not aﬀect
the BHS dynamics and evolution signiﬁcantly. Note also that
we adopted the observed metallicity, Z = 0.2Z⊙, when cal-
culating the ’present’ brightness of the NPS for comparison
with the observations.

2.4 Results for C (BS) vs E (AGN) type energy

injections

The calculated result for C (continuous; BS like) type injec-
tion is shown in ﬁgures 2, 3 and 4. The shock front expands
spherically in the initial ∼ 1 Myr, and, then, it is elongated
into the halo, composing dumbbell shaped symmetric bub-
bles with respect to the galactic disk, which we call the BHS.
Detailed description of the structure and evolution is given
in the next subsection.

In this paper, we describe the result of C type in detail,
which was found to ﬁt the NPS morphology better than
the E type result. However, we do not intend to deny the
E type event, which might be simpler to explain the shell
phenomena without worrying about multiple, complicated
phenomena recurrently occurring in the Galactic Center.

For comparison, we show the result for E (point explo-
sion; AGN like)-type injection in ﬁgure 5 for t = 3 Myr.
The global structure and evolution of the produced shock
wave shell is similar to that for C-type. However, the general
shock wave structure is much simpler. The highest density
appears at lower latitudes, whereas the highest temperature
was attained in the polar region in the front shock facing
the halo gas. The central region has much smoother struc-
ture compared to that for C type, having a simple cavity of
low density and low temperature. Since no wind blows, no
bow-shock or a cone structure is produced near the disk.

2.5 BHS by C-type injection for SB model

The simulated result for the C-type BHS evolution corre-
sponding to the SB model is shown in ﬁgures 2 to 4. Figure
6 shows cross sections along constant heights at z = 2 and 4
kpc at t = 10 Myr, and ﬁgure 7 shows radial cross sections
at altitude angle Θ = 30◦ and 45◦ from the galactic plane.
The central disk within a few hundred pc is disrupted
to yield a hole inside a ring around the nucleus. Due to the
continuous injection of mass, there appears an outward ﬂow.
When the outﬂow encounters the wall of the hole, it pro-
duces a shock-compressed ring, and a bow shock is produced,
which extends into the halo as a cone-shaped, high-pressure
discontinuity. By the constantly injected energy, the central
region is kept at high temperature and high density. We will
discuss the central reion in more detail in section 4.

When the outﬂow encounters the halo gas, it produces
round-shaped shock wave. The shock front velocity is decel-
erated near the galactic plane by the interaction with the
dense ambient gas. The shock front expands spherically in
the initial ∼ 1 Myr, and is elongated into the halo as the
time elapses. In the halo, the expanding velocity increases
due to energy injection at the center and as well as by the
jet-acceleration mechanism of Sakashita (1971) in exponen-
tially decreasing gas density.

When BHS reaches high-altitude at z ∼ 6 kpc and en-
counters the intergalactic gas, the front suﬀers from decel-
erating force. However, due to the continous supply of gas
and energy from inside, the front still continues to expand
at increasing velocity.

Figure 4 shows enlargement of the result at 10 Myr with
the density and temperature in a mirror plot for convenience
of comparison and recognizing the mutual correspondence.
The ﬁgure reveals more clearly the bipolar hyper shell (BHS)
structure of the outer shock front propagating in the halo.
Also impressive in this ﬁgure is the inner bipolar conical
horn feature, which is a bow shock against the galactic disk
produced by a high-velocity wind from the center (see the
discussion section).

As shown in ﬁgures 6 and 7 the densest shell follows
the shock front, while the highest temperature is attained
inside the shell, facing the cavity. The dense shell, where the
emission measure is largest, has temperature around ∼ 0.3
keV (3.5 × 106 K), in agreement with the observed temper-
ature in the NPS (Kataoka et al. 2015). On the other hand,
the high temperature inner shell facing cavity, where T ∼ 4
keV (∼ 5 × 107 K), has density one to two orders of magni-
tude less than that in the dense shell. Hence, the emission
measure in the high temperature cavity is much lower than

compared to the shell.

3.1 Emission Measure

Using the calculated density distribution by the BHS model,
we calculated the emission measure along the line of sight s,

EM = Z (ρ/mH)2ds.

(7)

During the integration, we avoided the contribution from
the ambient disk and halo gases by setting a minimum tem-
perature of gas at Tmin = 3 × 106, which is the halo gas
temperature as represented by ﬂat temperature beyond 5
kpc in ﬁgure 6. By this condition, the lower temperature
disk is also avoided from integration. This limitation does
not cause signiﬁcant under estimation of EM in the NPS,
because the temperature inside the BHS is mostly higher
than 3 × 106 K (ﬁgure 6).
A result for t = 10 Myr is shown in ﬁgure 8 by a contour
map in the 50◦ × 50◦ sky, as well as by cross sections along
constant latitudes, b = 20◦ and 30◦. The peak values across
the BHS are obtained to be EM ≃ 0.1 − 0.37cm−6pc at
b = 10◦ and 40◦.
Figure 9 shows the simulated EM plotted against lat-
itude. Plotted together are the EM values determined by
Suzaku observations along the NPS at b ∼ 10−50◦ (Kataoka
et al. 2015). The calculated values are greater than the ob-
served values, which are EM ∼ 0.06 − 0.3, by a factor of
∼ 1.5. Similar values, ∼ 0.1 cm−6pc, have been obtained by
Willingale et al. (2003) based on a local shell origin of NPS.

3.2 Emission

We calculated the emissivity of X-rays using the computed
density and temperature, assuming a metallicity of Z =
0.2Z⊙ and cooling functions given by Foster et al. (2012)
as shown in ﬁgure 10 obtained by using XSPEC (Arnauld
et al. 1996). The surface brightness on the sky at photon
energy E was calculated by integrating the emissivity along
the line sight,

Here, dP (E)/dE is the spectral emissivity per unit volume
and unit density per unit photon energy E, and ne is the
electron density assumed to be equal to the ion density ne ≃
ρ/mH. The brightness B is expressed in Jy str−1.
The spectral emissivity was averaged by E, assum-
ing a Gaussian response function with a full width of half
maximum ∆E = 0.5E around the center energy E. Fig-
ure 10 shows the thus obtained spectral emissivity as func-
tions of the plasma temperature for ﬁxed photon energies at
E = 0.25, 0.7 and 1.5 keV, approximately representing the
ROSAT R2, 4 and 7 bands.

3.3 Absorption and shadowing

The optical depth of X-ray emission is deﬁned by τ = N σi,
where σi is the absorption cross section for the i-th band.
X-ray absorption coeﬃcient by metals in the interstellar
gas with solar abundance was calculated by using ’ISMabs’
(Gatuzz et al. 2015) implemented in XSPEC as shown in
ﬁgure 11, and the adopted values are listed in table 1.

The H atom column density N was calculated using ob-
served integrated intensities of the HI and CO (J = 1 − 0)
line emissions. We used the Argentine-Leiden-Bonn All-Sky
HI Survey (Kalbelra et al. 2005) and the Columbia Galac-
tic Plane CO Survey (Dame et al. 2002). The total column
density N (H) of hydrogen atoms is obtained by

N (H) = CHIIHI + 2CH2 ICO,

(9)

where IHI and ICO are integrated HI and CO line intensities.
The HI conversion factor was taken to be CHI = 1.82 ×
1018cm−2/K km s−1. The CO-to-H2 conversion factor was
assumed to be CH2 = 2.0 × 1020H2cm−2/K km s−1 for the
local interstellar gas having the solar abundance (e.g. Bol-
lato et al. 2013). Figure 12 shows a distribution map of
the optical depth τ4 = N/N4 for R4 band X-rays, which
is equivalent to the distribution of the total H atom column
density, except that the values are divided by N4. Optical
depth maps for other bands are obtained by multiplying
τi = τ4N4/Ni.

The absorption was calculated for ﬁxed photon energy
in each band, and hence, the model intensity distribution

high-velocity outﬂow as a bow shock against the galactic disk.

represents a monochromatic view of shadowed sky. In ob-
servations, however, the photon spectra are eﬀectively hard-
ened by the absorption within each band. However, the emis-
sivity itself is a decreasing function of E. Figure 11 shows
the absorption cross section and spectral emissivity, and
the transmitted emission through gas with optical thickness
unity , τ = 1. The ﬁgure demonstrates that the absorption
and emission dependencies with photon energy act to cancel
each other, so that the transmitted emission has nearly a ﬂat
spectrum. Thus we may conclude that the monochromatic

tions without suﬀering from interstellar absorption. These

brightness distributions using τi distribution as shown in ﬁg-

while ROSAT brightness in 10−6counts s−1 arcmin−2. Fig-
ure 16 is a color coded representation compared with the
ROSAT color map.

As in ﬁgure 13, the BHS shows up as the dumbbell
shaped structure of symmetric spurs extending toward the
galactic poles. The observed North Polar Spur is well repro-
duced by the simulation. The western counter part of NPS
(NPS-W) at (l, b) ∼ (−30◦, +10 − 40◦), the South Polar

Spurs SPS-E and SPS-W are also seen in the ROSAT map,
though not clear as in the north (see the next section for
cross sections).

The BHS spurs near the galactic plane are heavily
obscured by the HI and molecular gas layers, spurs and
clouds. Various shadow features are evident, silhouetting
the BHS and halo X-ray emissions. Particularly, the R4
band NPS ridge is strongly shadowed by the Aquila Rift
at (l, b) ∼ (25◦, 12◦), where the Rift’s ridge crosses the NPS
nearly perpendicularly. The R7 band emission is less ob-
scured, and shows more intrinsic structures. However, the
observed ROSAT R7 band image is too noisy to show up
the detailed structure of the spurs.

The 0.25 keV (∼R2) emission is strongly absorbed by
the local interstellar gas, and only high-latitude emission
weakly remains as northern and southern polar caps. The
simulated 0.25 keV brightness is an order of magnitude
darker than the intrinsic brightness. This is due to heavy
extinction with large optical depth at |b| <∼ 30◦, particu-
larly, due to the HI and H2 spurs and ﬂares of the Aquila
Rift. Although the simulated and ROSAT R2 band images
are similar to each other, they may not be further compared

seriously, because the observed R2 emission is a mixture of
local emissions such as the Solar Wind Charge eXchange
and the Local Hot Bubble.

4 DISCUSSION

The shock front was shown to expand spherically in the
initial ∼ 1 Myr, and is elongated into the halos composing
dumbbell shaped symmetric bubble features with respect to
the galactic disk. Expected X-ray brightness distributions
were calculated for the central ±50◦ × ±50◦ region at three
diﬀerent energies (0.25, 0.7, and 1.5 keV), approximately
corresponding to R2, R4 and R7 ROSAT bands. Shadowing
by the interstellar HI and H2 gases was taken into account
to compute the brightness distributions on the sky.

The simulated X-ray maps at elapsed time t ∼ 10 My
approximately reproduces the morphological features of the
NPS and SPS as observed by ROSAT. The modeled emission
measure was found to be greater than those from Suzaku
observations at a couple of tens positions by a factor of ∼
1.5. Below, we consider about the implication of the results
and discuss some problems exhibited by this study.

4.1 Simulation vs Observation

4.1.1 ROSAT count rate vs Jy str−1

The ROSAT data are represented in terms of count rate of
the instrument in unit of counts s−1 arcmin−2, but not cali-
brated to intensity, whereas the simulated result is presented
in unit of Jy str−1 1. In order to obtain quantitative com-
parison, we calibrated the ROSAT data into Jy str−1 using
the Suzaku observations of the emission measure (EM ) and
plasma temperature in the region near the Fermi Bubbles
including NPS and southern spurs obtained by Kataoka et
al. (2015).

X-ray brightness B at photon energy E = 0.7 keV was

1 1 Jy = 10−26w m−2 Hz−1 = 2.41798 × 10−9erg cm−2 s−1 eV−1

calculated by using the measured EM for plasma temper-
ature of T = 0.3 keV (Kataoka et al. 2015) adopting the
cooling function for a metallicity Z = 0.2Z⊙ as shown in
ﬁgure 1. Individual values were also multiplied by exp(−τ )
with τ being the optical depth for NH at corresponding posi-
tions. Figure 17 shows the thus calculated brightness plotted
against the ROSAT count rate in R4 band at the same po-
sitions.

Removing the exceptionally large value near the top-
right corner, we applied the least-square linear ﬁtting,
and obtained the straight line. The slope of the ﬁtting
is adopted as the calibration factor X(R4) as X(R4) =
0.398±0.021 mJy str−1(1.0 × 10−6counts s−1 arcmin−2)−1.
Using the thus determined factor, we compare the intensities
by simulation and observations.

4.1.2 Intensities

Figure 18 shows cross sections of the R4 band intensity by
observation (dots) and 0.7 keV by simulation (thick lines)
along constant latitudes at b = +30◦ to −30◦. The plots
were obtained as follows: the original ROSAT R4 map was
convolved by a Gaussian function with a half width of 1 pixel
(0◦.2). Then, pixel values along three rows at b = +20◦±0◦.2
and −30◦ ± 0◦.2 were plotted by circles. The intensity scales
are both in mJy str−1.
The observed northern cross section at b = +20◦ ex-
hibits double horn peaks of NPS and NPS-W. The NPS-W
is contaminated by the bulge emission whose eastern half is
heavily shadowed by the Aquila Rift. The simulated cross
section shows the double horn feature symmetrically to the
Galactic Center.

The southern cross section at b = −30◦ by simulation,
particularly SPS-E, well ﬁts the observation in the shape.
The SPS-W is again contaminated by the bulge emission as
the round enhancement around the Galactic Center.

Although the agreement of peak intensities in the NPS
is excellent, the simulated intensities are generally higher
than the observations. We may eye-estimate the simulated-
to-observed intensity ratios at the peaks in ﬁgure 18 to ob-
tain Bsimu/Bobs = 1.6 ± 0.8. This ratio is directly related to

the emission measure, and therefore, the gas density in the
BHS and the ambient halo gas as ρsimu/ρobs ∼ 1.3.

4.1.3 Metallicity

Although we assumed Z = Z⊙ as the marginal value for
the entire evolution of BHS, it is, in reality, variable with
time and place. In the early phase of expansion, the BHS is
dominated by the high-metal gas in the Galactic Center and
the disk where Z > Z⊙. As it expands into the halo, the BHS
becomes dominated by the swept halo gas and intergalactic
gas with Z < Z⊙. However, the radiative cooling does not
contribute much to the dynamical evolution of the BHS,
namely simulations assuming a diﬀerent metallicity would
result in almost the same result.

On the other hand, the X-ray brightness was calculated
for the observed metallicity in the galactic halo with Z =
0.2Z⊙. Hence, the metallicity in the simulation and in the

is smaller than those estimated for super winds in star-
burst galaxies (Heckman et al. 1990), while greater than
that for the starburst galaxy M82 (Lacki et al. 2014). It is
also greater than that proposed for the Galactic Center in
order to produce the Fermi Bubbles (Crocker et al. 2015).

4.2.1 Energy partitioning in the BHS

The total injected energy E0 is ﬁnally transformed to the
thermal Eth, kinetic Ekin, and gravitational Egrav energies of
the BHS as well as to the radiatively lost energy by cooling
Erad:

E0 = Eth + Ekin + Egrav + Erad.

(10)

Individual energies are approximately estimated using the
ﬁgures presented in section 2 as the following. The BHS mass
is estimated to be MBHS ∼ 5 × 107M⊙• for the both sides,
each with a radius R ∼ 4 kpc and thickness ∆R ∼ 1 kpc
and mean density of n ∼ 0.005 cm−3. The thermal energy is
estimated for a mean temperature of T ∼ 3×107 K, where R
being the gas constant. The kinetic energy is estimated for
an expansion velocity Vexpa ∼ 400 km s−1. The gravitational
energy can be estimated by ∆Φ ∼ GMgal(1/h0−1/h), where
Φ is the gravitational potential, z0 ∼ 2 kpc and z ∼ 4 kpc are
the initial and the present heights of BHS gas. The galactic
mass within a radius r ∼ z0 kpc is estimated by Mgal ∼
rot/G ∼ 1.8 × 1010M⊙• for a rotation velocity Vrot ≃ 200
z0V 2
km s−1. The radiative loss during t ∼ 10 Myr is estimated
for a cooling rate of P (T ) ∼ 3 × 10−23ergs cm3 s−1 at T ∼
3 × 107 K and n ∼ 10−2cm−3.
Eth = Z pdV ∼ RMBHST ∼ 2.5 × 1056ergs,
Ekin ∼ 1/2MBHSV 2
Egrav ∼ MBHS∆Φ ∼ 2 × 1055ergs,
Erad ∼ tZ n2P (T )dV ∼ 3 × 1054ergs,

expa ∼ 8 × 1055ergs,

We now obtain:

depth for other bands are obtained by τi = τ4N4/Ni.

brightness calculation is not fully consistent with each other.
A consistent modeling would be a subject for the future.

4.2 Energetics

We have presented the result of BHS simulation for a contin-
uous energy injection (type C injection) with E = 4 × 1056
ergs in the last 10 Myr presuming recurrent starbursts in
the Galactic Center (SB model). The total injected energy

Galactic Center Hyper Shell and the North Polar Spur

longer than the expansion time of the shell. This implies that
the BHS dynamics is little depends on the cooling rate, and
hence on the density and metallicity. Namely, the result will
be not changed much even if we adopt smaller metallicity
than the assumed value (1 solar).

4.2.2 Constraint on the total energy

We thus conclude that the total energy on the order of E0 ∼
4× 1056 ergs is inevitably required in order to reproduce the
observed X-ray NPS and associated spurs in the BHS model
for the given halo density. Thereby, the emission measure
(density), temperature (velocity), and the linear size of the
NPS are the strongest observational constraint on the total
energy.

If the halo density is decreased by a factor of 1/1.3 as
indicated by comparison with the emission measure observed
with Suzaku, the total energy will be eased by the same
factor, considering the Sedov’s similarity factor (E0/ρ0)1/5
in the shock wave. Thus, we conclude that the total injected
energy to drive the NPS is E0 ∼ 3 × 1056 ergs.

4.2.3 SB model and star formation rate

Given the total energy as above, the assumed rate of energy
supply of dE /dt ∼ 4× 1055 ergs Myr−1 is required in the C-
type injection model, though reduced by a factor of 1/1.3. If
we consider an SB model, it requires a type II supernova rate
as high as ∼ 4× 105 per 10 Myr, or 1 SN per 20 to 30 yrs in
the Galactic Center, comparable to the SN rate in the entire
Galaxy. The assumed inﬂow rate of dM/dt ∼ 1M⊙• yr−1 is
comparable, but slightly greater than the often quoted rate
dM/dt ∼ 0.1− 1M⊙• yr−1 (Kruijssen et al. 2013; Krumuholz
and Kruijssen 2015). Hence, it may be worth to consider
other types of mechanism of energy injection energy in the
Galactic Center.

4.2.4 AGN model with E-type energy injection

An additional or alternative energy source to drive the
BHS could be the E-type energy injection at the center.
A powerful energy source without suﬀering from the prob-
lem about star formation and mass inﬂow would be the
E-type explosion due to AGN activity at the Galactic nu-
cleus, which occurs intermittently each with smaller energy
(Totani et al. 2006). In this case the total energy is given by
E0 = ESB + EAGN, and the mass inﬂow rate is accordingly
reduced with increasing AGN activity.

+30◦, + 20◦, − 20◦ and b = −30◦ (thick lines) compared with
those of ROSAT R4 band (circles). Both are shown by brightness
in mJy str−1.

(15)

and
E0 = Eth + Ekin + Egrav + Erad ∼ 5 × 1056ergs.
The estimation using the ﬁgure may include an error of ∼
±30%, that is the reason for the larger ﬁgure of total energy
than the input intival value of 4 × 1056 ergs.
The relative fractions of the energies compared to E0 are
rather more accurate, and are: Eth/E0 ∼ 0.7, Ekin/E0 ∼ 0.2,
Egrav/E0 ∼ 0.06, and Erad/E0 ∼ 0.01. The small radiative
loss implies that the BHS is almost adiabatic. This can be
conﬁrmed by the long cooling time, tcool ∼ 9 × 109 yrs, far

4.3 Central structures

4.3.1 Mach cone
Figure 19 shows a central ±25◦ × ±25◦ region in the simu-
lated 1.5 keV brightness compared with ROSAT R7 image.
In the simulation, a cone-shaped bow shock is recognized
as bipolar inclined spurs emerging from the central region,
which is a sonic boom, or Mach cone, produced by the inter-
action of the outﬂow with the dense wall of the holed disk.
The Mach angle of the cone is µ ≃ 58◦, indicating a Mach
number M = 1/sin µ ∼ 1.12. This is consistent with the

postulated outﬂow velocity and temperature of the gas in
the corresponding region.

The Mach cone morphologically reproduces the X-ray
bipolar conical structure. However, the simulated cone is
fainter compared to the observation. Brighter cone could be
obtained, if the energy injection rate was not constant, but
varied intermittently, so that the most recent injection was
strong enough to enhance the cone’s emissivity. This idea is
consistent with the shorter time scale, ∼ 106 yrs, suggested
for the Fermi Bubbles with which the X-ray Claw feature in
the southern spur is associated (Kataoka et al. 2013, 2015).

4.3.2 Central hot zone and expanding rings

Figure 20 shows a cross section of the simulated distribution
of 1.5 keV brightness along the galactic plane. There ap-
pear three characteristic regions. A round hot zone of high-
temperature plasma is produced by the injection of starburst
thermal energy in the central ∼ 300 pc at |l| 6 3◦. A shock-
compressed ring of radius ∼ 1 kpc at the root of the hot
cone at l = ±8◦ appears as the two horn like enhancement
of X-rays. A larger radius ring of a radius ∼ 3.3 kpc appears
as the broad maxima at l ≃ 24◦ corresponding to the root
of the BHS.
These three structures may be related to observed fea-
tures in the Galactic Center at various wavelengths. The
central hot zone may correspond to the high-temperature
plasma at ∼ 10 keV observed in hard X-ray emissions
(Uchiyama et al. 2013). The 1 kpc ring may be a scaled
up event of the various gas rings (Bania 1980; Sofue 1995;
Law 2010; Krumholz and Kruijssen 2015). The 3.3 kpc com-
pressed ring associated with BHS coincides with the 3-kpc
expanding ring observed in the HI line longitude-velocity di-
agram (Oort 1977). As readily known by a fast-mode MHD
wave calculation (Sofue 1977), the compression occurs from
outside of the disk by refraction and focusing of the shock
wave propagating through the halo.

4.4 BHS morphology: Asymmetry and

intergalactic wind

In ﬁgures 16 and 18 the observed north-south and east-west
asymmetry is evident in the sense that the NPS is a few
times brighter than SPS and that the NPS-E and -W are
inclined toward the west compared to the simulation.

The north-south asymmetry may indicate that the elec-
tron density in the north is signiﬁcantly higher than in the
south. Such an asymmetry of the BHS could be produced by
an intergalactic wind or a motion of the Galaxy through the
intergalactic gas (Sofue 1994). The wind will yield higher
density and pressure in the northern halo, whereas the
southern halo suﬀers from rarefaction due to shading by the
galactic disk from the wind.

The axial asymmetry could also be explained by a
wind from the east to west. Hence, we may speculate that
an intergalactic wind blows from the galactic north-east
toward south-west. Diagnosis of intergalactic wind using
the BHS morphology would be a subject for future 3D
simulations.
