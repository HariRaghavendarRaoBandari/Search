Abstract

We present a deep hierarchical recur-
rent neural network for sequence tagging.
Given a sequence of words, our model em-
ploys deep gated recurrent units on both
character and word levels to encode mor-
phology and context information, and ap-
plies a conditional random ﬁeld layer to
predict the tags. Our model is task inde-
pendent, language independent, and fea-
ture engineering free. We further ex-
tend our model to multi-task and cross-
lingual joint training by sharing the ar-
chitecture and parameters. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple
languages on several benchmark tasks in-
cluding POS tagging, chunking, and NER.
We also demonstrate that multi-task and
cross-lingual joint training can improve
the performance in various cases.

Introduction

1
Sequence tagging is a fundamental problem in nat-
ural language processing which has many wide
applications, including part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ging, chunking, and named entity recognition
(NER). Given a sequence of words, sequence tag-
ging aims to predict a linguistic tag for each word
such as the POS tag. Recently progress has been
made on neural sequence-tagging models which
make only minimal assumptions about the lan-
guage, task, and feature set (Collobert et al., 2011)
This paper explores an important potential
advantage of these task-independent,
language-
independent and feature-engineering free mod-
els:
their ability to be jointly trained on multi-
ple tasks. In particular, we explore two types of
joint training. In multi-task joint training, a model
is jointly trained to perform multiple sequence-

tagging tasks in the same language—e.g., POS

tagging and NER for English.
joint training, a model is trained to perform the
same task in multiple languages—e.g., NER in
English and Spanish.

Multi-task joint training can exploit the fact that
different sequence tagging tasks in one language
share language-speciﬁc regularities. For example,
models of English POS tagging and English NER
might beneﬁt from using similar underlying rep-
resentations for words, and in past work, certain
sequence-tagging tasks have beneﬁtted by lever-
aging the underlying similarity of related tasks
(Ando and Zhang, 2005). Currently, however, the
best results on speciﬁc sequence-tagging tasks are
usually achieved by approaches that target only
one speciﬁc task, either POS tagging (Søgaard,
2011; Toutanova et al., 2003), chunking (Shen and
Sarkar, 2005), or NER (Luo et al., 2015; Pas-
sos et al., 2014). Such approaches employ sep-
arate model development for each individual task,
which makes joint training difﬁcult. In other work,
some recent neural approaches have been pro-
posed to address multiple sequence tagging prob-
lems in a uniﬁed framework (Huang et al., 2015).
Though gains have been shown using multi-task
joint training, the prior models that beneﬁt from
multi-task joint training did not achieve state-of-
the-art performance (Collobert et al., 2011); thus
the question of whether joint training can improve
over strong baseline methods is still unresolved.

Cross-lingual joint training typically uses word
alignments or parallel corpora to improve the per-
formance on different languages (Kiros et al.,
2014; Gouws et al., 2014). However, many suc-
cessful approaches in sequence tagging rely heav-
ily on feature engineering to handcraft language-
dependent features, such as character-level mor-
phological features and word-level N-gram pat-
terns (Huang et al., 2015; Toutanova et al., 2003;

Sun et al., 2008), making it difﬁcult to share la-
tent representations between different languages.
Some multilingual taggers that do not rely on fea-
ture engineering have also been presented (Lam-
ple et al., 2016; dos Santos et al., 2015), but while
these methods are language-independent, they do
not study the effect of cross-lingual joint training.
In this work, we focus on developing a general
model that can be applied in both multi-task and
cross-lingual settings by learning from scratch,
i.e., without feature engineering or pipelines.
Given a sequence of words, our model employs
deep gated recurrent units on both character and
word levels, and applies a conditional random ﬁeld
layer to make the structured prediction. On the
character level, the gated recurrent units capture
the morphological information; on the word level,
the gated recurrent units learn N-gram patterns and
word semantics.

Our model can handle both multi-task and
cross-lingual joint training in a uniﬁed manner
by simply sharing the network architecture and
model parameters between tasks and languages.
For multi-task joint training, we share both char-
acter and word level parameters between tasks
to learn language-speciﬁc regularities. For cross-
lingual joint training, we share the character-level
parameters to capture the morphological similarity
between languages without use of parallel corpora
or word alignments.

We evaluate our model on ﬁve datasets of differ-
ent tasks and languages, including POS tagging,
chunking and NER in English; and NER in Dutch
and Spanish. We achieve state-of-the-art results
on several standard benchmarks: CoNLL 2000
chunking (95.41%), CoNLL 2002 Dutch NER
(85.19%), CoNLL 2003 Spanish NER (85.77%),
and CoNLL 2003 English NER (91.20%). We also
achieve very competitive results on Penn Tree-
bank POS tagging (97.55%, the second best re-
sult in the literature). Finally, we conduct experi-
ments to systematically explore the effectiveness
of multi-task and cross-lingual joint training on
several tasks.

2 Related Work

Ando and Zhang (2005) proposed a multi-task
joint training framework that shares structural pa-
rameters among multiple tasks, and improved the
performance on various tasks including NER. Col-
lobert et al.
(2011) presented a task indepen-

dent convolutional network and employed multi-
task joint training to improve the performance of
chunking. However, there is still a gap between
these multi-task approaches and the state-of-the-
art results on individual tasks. Furthermore, it is
unclear whether these approaches can be effective
in a cross-lingual setting.

Multilingual resources were extensively used
for cross-lingual sequence tagging through vari-
ous ways, such as cross-lingual feature extraction
(Darwish, 2013), text categorization (Virga and
Khudanpur, 2003), and Bayesian parallel data pre-
diction (Snyder et al., 2008). Parallel corpora and
word alignments are also used for training cross-
lingual distributed word representations (Kiros et
al., 2014; Gouws et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2015).
Unlike these approaches, our method mainly fo-
cuses on using morphological similarity for cross-
lingual joint training.

Several neural architectures based on recurrent
networks were proposed for sequence tagging.
Huang et al. (2015) used word-level Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) units based on handcrafted
features; dos Santos et al. (2015) employed convo-
lutional layers on both character and word levels;
Chiu and Nichols (2015) applied convolutional
layers on the character level and LSTM units on
the word level; Gillick et al.
(2015) employed
a sequence-to-sequence LSTM with a novel tag-
ging scheme. We show that our architecture gives
better performance experimentally than these ap-
proaches in Section 5.

Most similar to our work is the recent approach
independently developed by Lample et al. (2016)
(published two weeks before our submission),
which employs LSTM on both character and word
levels. However, there are several crucial differ-
ences. First, we study cross-lingual joint train-
ing and show improvement over their approach
in various cases. Second, while they mainly fo-
cus on NER, we generalize our model to other se-
quence tagging tasks, and also demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of multi-task joint training. There are
also differences in the technical aspect, such as
the cost-sensitive loss function and gated recurrent
units used in our work.

3 Model

In this section, we present our model for sequence
tagging based on deep hierarchical gated recurrent
units and conditional random ﬁelds. Our recurrent

and character-level GRUs respectively). We only display the character-level GRU for the word Mike and omit others.

networks are hierarchical since we have multiple
layers on both word and character levels in a hier-
archy.

3.1 Gated Recurrent Unit
A gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is a type
of recurrent neural networks ﬁrst introduced for
machine translation (Cho et al., 2014). A recur-
rent network can be represented as a sequence
of units, corresponding to the input sequence
(x1, x2,··· , xT ), which can be either a word se-
quence in a sentence or a character sequence in a
word. The unit at position t takes xt and the pre-
vious hidden state ht−1 as input, and outputs the
current hidden state ht. The model parameters are
shared between different units in the sequence.

A gated recurrent unit at position t has two
gates, an update gate zt and a reset gate rt. More
speciﬁcally, each gated recurrent unit can be ex-
pressed as follows

rt = σ(Wrxxt + Wrhht−1)
zt = σ(Wzxxt + Wzhht−1)
˜ht = tanh(Whxxt + Whh(rt (cid:12) ht−1))
ht = zt (cid:12) ht−1 + (1 − zt) (cid:12) ˜ht,

where W ’s are model parameters of each unit, ˜ht
is a candidate hidden state that is used to compute
ht, σ is an element-wise sigmoid logistic function
deﬁned as σ(x) = 1/(1 + e−x), and (cid:12) denotes
element-wise multiplication of two vectors. Intu-
itively, the update gate zt controls how much the
unit updates its hidden state, and the reset gate rt
determines how much information from the previ-
ous hidden state needs to be reset.

Since a recurrent neural network only models
the information ﬂow in one direction, it is usually
helpful to use an additional recurrent network that
goes in the reverse direction. More speciﬁcally,
we use bidirectional gated recurrent units, where
given a sequence of length T , we have one GRU
going from 1 to T and the other from T to 1. Let
←−
−→
h t and
h t denote the hidden states at position t
of the forward and backward GRUs respectively.
We concatenate the two hidden states to form the
ﬁnal hidden state ht = [

←−
h t].

−→
h t,

We stack multiple recurrent layers together to
form a deep recurrent network (Sutskever et al.,
2014). Each layer learns a more effective repre-
sentation taking the hidden states of the previous
layer as input. Let hl,t denote the hidden state at
position t in layer l. The forward GRU at posi-
−→
tion t in layer l computes
h l,t−1 and
hl−1,t as input, and the backward GRU performs
similar operations but in a reverse direction.

h l,t using

3.2 Hierarchical GRU

Our model employs a hierarchical GRU that en-
codes both word-level and character-level sequen-
tial information.

The input of our model is a sequence of words
(x1, x2,··· , xT ) of length T , where xt is a one-
of-K embedding of the t-th word. The word at
each position t also has a character-level repre-
sentation, denoted as a sequence of length St,
(ct,1, ct,2,··· , ct,St) where ct,s is the one-of-K
embedding of the s-th character in the t-th word.

3.2.1 Character-Level GRU
Given a word, we ﬁrst employ a deep bidirectional
GRU to learn useful morphological representation
from the character sequence of the word. Suppose
the character-level GRU has Lc layers, we then
←−
obtain forward and backward hidden states
h Lc,s
−→
and
h Lc,s at each position s in the character se-
quence. Since recurrent networks usually tend to
memorize more short-term patterns, we concate-
nate the ﬁrst hidden state of the backward GRU
and the last hidden state of the forward GRU to en-
code character-level morphology in both preﬁxes
and sufﬁxes. We further concatenate the character-
level representation with the one-of-K word em-
bedding xt to form the ﬁnal representation hw
t for
the t-th word. More speciﬁcally, we have

−→
h Lc,St,

←−
h Lc,1, xt],

hw

t = [

where hw
is a representation of the t-th word,
t
which encodes both character-level morphology
and word-level semantics, as shown in Figure 1.
3.2.2 Word-Level GRU
The character-level GRU outputs a sequence of
2 ,··· , hw
word representations hw = (hw
T ).
We employ a word-level deep bidirectional GRU
with Lw layers on top of these word representa-
tions. The word-level GRU takes the sequence hw
as input, and computes a sequence of hidden states
h = (h1, h2,··· , hT ).

1 , hw

Different from the character-level GRU, the
word-level GRU aims to extract the context in-
formation in the word sequence, such as N-gram
patterns and neighbor word dependencies. Such
information is usually encoded using handcrafted
features. However, as we show in our experimen-
tal results, the word-level GRU can learn the rele-
vant information without being language-speciﬁc
or task-speciﬁc. The hidden states h output by the
word-level GRU will be used as input features for
the next layers.

3.3 Conditional Random Field
The goal of sequence tagging is to predict a se-
quence of tags y = (y1, y2,··· , yT ). To model
the dependencies between tags in a sequence, we
apply a conditional random ﬁeld (Lafferty et al.,
2001) layer on top of the hidden states h output
by the word-level GRU (Huang et al., 2015). Let
Y(h) denote the space of tag sequences for h. The
conditional log probability of a tag sequence y,

given the hidden state sequence h, can be written
as
log p(y|h) = f (h, y) − log

exp f (h, y(cid:48)),

(cid:88)

y(cid:48)∈Y(h)

(1)
where f is a function that assigns a score for each
pair of h and y.

To deﬁne the function f (h, y), for each posi-
tion t, we multiply the hidden state hw
t with a pa-
rameter vector wyt that is indexed by the the tag
yt, to obtain the score for assigning yt at position t.
Since we also need to consider the correlation be-
tween tags, we impose ﬁrst order dependency by
adding a score Ayt−1,yt at position t, where A is
a parameter matrix deﬁning the similarity scores
between different tag pairs. Formally, the function
f can be written as

T(cid:88)

T(cid:88)

f (h, y) =

wT

ythw

t +

Ayt−1,yt,

t=1

t=1

where we set y0 to be a START token.

It is possible to directly maximize the condi-
tional log likelihood based on Eq. (1). However,
this training objective is usually not optimal since
each possible y(cid:48) contributes equally to the objec-
tive function. Therefore, we add a cost function
between y and y(cid:48) based on the max-margin princi-
ple that high-cost tags y(cid:48) should be penalized more
heavily (Gimpel and Smith, 2010). More speciﬁ-
cally, the objective function to maximize for each
training instance y and h is written as
f (h, y)− log

exp(f (h, y(cid:48)) + cost(y, y(cid:48))).

(cid:88)

y(cid:48)∈Y(h)

(2)
In our work, the cost function is deﬁned as
the tag-wise Hamming loss between two tag se-
quences multiplied by a constant. The objective
function on the training set is the sum of Eq. (2)
over all the training instances. The full architec-
ture of our model is illustrated in Figure 1.

3.4 Training
We employ mini-batch AdaGrad (Duchi et al.,
2011) to train our neural network in an end-to-
end manner with backpropagation. Both the char-
acter embeddings and word embeddings are ﬁne-
tuned during training. We use dynamic program-
ming to compute the normalizer of the CRF layer
in Eq. (2). When making prediction, we again use
dynamic programming in the CRF layer to decode
the most probable tag sequence.

algorithm in the multi-task setting. Suppose we
have D tasks, with the training instances of each
task being (X1, X2,··· , XD). Each task d has a
set of model parameters Wd, which is divided into
two sets, task speciﬁc parameters and shared pa-
rameters, i.e.,

Wd = Wd,spec ∪ Wshared,

where shared parameters Wshared are a set of pa-
rameters that are shared among the D tasks, while
task speciﬁc parameters Wd,spec are the rest of the
parameters that are trained for each task d sepa-
rately.

During joint training, we are optimizing the av-
erage over all objective functions of D tasks. We
iterate over each task d, sample a batch of training
instances from Xd, and perform a gradient descent
step to update model parameters Wd. Similarly,
we can derive a cross-lingual joint training algo-
rithm by replacing D tasks with D languages.

The network architectures we employ for joint
training are illustrated in Figure 2. For multi-task
joint training, we share all the parameters below
the CRF layer including word embeddings to learn
language-speciﬁc regularities shared by the tasks.
For cross-lingual joint training, we share the pa-
rameters of the character-level GRU to capture
the morphological similarity between languages.
Note that since we do not consider using paral-
lel corpus in this work, we mainly focus on joint
training between languages with similar morphol-
ogy. We leave the study of cross-lingual joint
training by sharing word semantics based on par-
allel corpora to future work.

5 Experiments
In this section, we use several benchmark datasets
for multiple tasks in multiple languages to evaluate
our model as well as the joint training algorithm.

5.1 Datasets and Settings
We use the following benchmark datasets in our
experiments: Penn Treebank (PTB) POS tagging,
CoNLL 2000 chunking, CoNLL 2003 English
NER, CoNLL 2002 Dutch NER and CoNLL 2002
Spanish NER. The statistics of the datasets are de-
scribed in Table 1.

We construct the POS tagging dataset with the
instructions described in Toutanova et al. (2003).
Note that as a standard practice, the POS tags are
extracted from the parsed trees.

lingual joint training. Red boxes indicate shared architecture
and parameters. Blue boxes are task/language speciﬁc com-
ponents trained separately. Eng, Span, Char, and Emb refer

4 Multi-Task and Cross-Lingual Joint

Training

In this section we study joint training of multiple
tasks and multiple languages. On one hand, differ-
ent sequence tagging tasks in the same language
share language-speciﬁc regularities. For exam-
ple, POS tagging and NER in English should learn
similar underlying representation since they are in
the same language. On the other hand, some lan-
guages share character-level morphologies, such
as English and Spanish. Therefore, it is desirable
to leverage multi-task and cross-lingual joint train-
ing to boost model performance.

Since our model is generally applicable to dif-
ferent tasks in different languages, it can be nat-
urally extended to multi-task and cross-lingual
joint training. The basic idea is to share part of
the architecture and parameters between tasks and
languages, and to jointly train multiple objective
functions with respect to different tasks and lan-
guages.

We now discuss the details of our joint training

For the task of CoNLL 2003 English NER,
we follow previous works (Collobert et al., 2011;
Huang et al., 2015; Chiu and Nichols, 2015) to ap-
pend one-hot gazetteer features to the input of the
CRF layer for fair comparison.1

We set the hidden state dimensions to be 300 for
the word-level GRU. We set the number of GRU
layers to Lc = Lw = 2 (two layers for the word-
level and character-level GRUs respectively). The
learning rate is ﬁxed at 0.01. We use the develop-
ment set to tune the other hyperparameters of our
model. Since the CoNLL 2000 chunking dataset
does not have a development set, we hold out one
ﬁfth of the training set for parameter tuning.

We truncate all words whose character sequence
length is longer than a threshold (17 for English,
35 for Dutch, and 20 for Spanish). We replace
all numeric characters with “0”. We also use the
BIOES (Begin, Inside, Outside, End, Single) tag-
ging scheme (Ratinov and Roth, 2009).

5.2 Pre-Trained Word Embeddings
Since the training corpus for a sequence tagging
task is relatively small, it is difﬁcult to train ran-

age word embeddings pre-trained on large-scale

are publicly available.

On the English datasets, following previous
works that are based on neural networks (Col-
lobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015; Chiu
and Nichols, 2015), we use the 50-dimensional
SENNA embeddings2 trained on Wikipedia. For
Spanish and Dutch, we use the 64-dimensional
Polyglot embeddings3 (Al-Rfou et al., 2013),
which are trained on Wikipedia articles of the cor-
responding languages. We use pre-trained word
embeddings as initialization, and ﬁne-tune the em-
beddings during training.

5.3 Performance
In this section, we report the results of our model
on the benchmark datasets and compare to the
previously-reported state-of-the-art results.

1Although gazetteers are arguably a type of feature engi-
neering, we note that unlike most feature engineering tech-
niques they are straightforward to include in a model. We use
only the gazetteer ﬁle provided by the CoNLL 2003 shared
task, and do not use gazetteers for any other tasks or lan-
guages described here.

For English NER,

there are two evaluation
methods used in the literature. Some models are
trained with both the training and development set,
while others are trained with the training set only.
We report our results in both cases.
In the ﬁrst
case, we tune the hyperparameters by training on
the training set and testing on the development set.
Besides our standalone model, we experi-
mented with multi-task and cross-lingual
joint
training as well, using the architecture described in
Section 4. For multi-task joint training, we jointly
train all tasks in English, including POS tagging,
chunking and NER. For cross-lingual joint train-
ing, we jointly train NER in English, Dutch and
Spanish. We also remove the word embeddings
and the character-level GRU respectively to ana-
lyze the contribution of different components.

The results are shown in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
and 7. We achieve state-of-the-art results on En-
glish NER, Dutch NER, Spanish NER and En-
glish chunking. Our model outperforms the best
previously-reported results on Dutch NER and En-
glish chunking by 2.35 points and 0.95 points re-
spectively. We also achieve the second best re-

worse than the current state-of-the-art.

Joint

training improves the performance on
Spanish NER, Dutch NER and English chunking
by 1.08 points, 0.19 points and 0.75 points respec-
tively, and has no signiﬁcant improvement on En-
glish POS tagging and English NER.

On POS tagging, the best result is 97.78% re-
ported by Ling et al. (2015). However, the em-
beddings they used are not publicly available. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we
slightly revise our model to reimplement their
model with the same parameter settings described
in their original paper. We use SENNA embed-
dings to initialize the reimplemented model for
fair comparison, and obtain an accuracy of 97.41%
that is 0.14 points worse than our result, which in-
dicates that our model is more effective and the
main difference lies in using different pre-trained
embeddings.

By comparing the results without the character-

level GRU and without word embeddings, we can
observe that both components contribute to the
ﬁnal results.
It is also clear that word embed-
dings have signiﬁcantly more contribution than
the character-level GRU, which indicates that our
model largely depends on memorizing the word
semantics. Character-level morphology, on the
other hand, has relatively smaller but still critical
contribution.

Joint Training

5.4
In this section, we analyze the effectiveness of
multi-task and cross-lingual joint training in more
detail. In order to explore possible gains in per-
formance of joint training for resource-poor lan-
guages or tasks, we consider joint training of vari-
ous task pairs and language pairs where different-
sized subsets of the actual labeled corpora are
made available. Given a pair of tasks of languages,
we jointly train one task with full labels and the
other with partial labels. In particular, we intro-
duce a labeling rate r, and sample a fraction r
of the sentences in the training set, discarding the
rest. Evaluation is based on the partially-labeled
task. The results are reported in Table 8.

We observe that the performance of a speciﬁc
task with relatively lower labeling rates (0.1 and
0.3) can usually beneﬁt from other tasks with
full labels through multi-task or cross-lingual joint
training. The performance gain can be up to 1.99
points when the labeling rate of the target task
is 0.1. The improvement with 0.1 labeling rate is
on average 0.37 points larger than with 0.3 label-
ing rate, which indicates that the improvement of
joint training is more signiﬁcant when the target

compare the results obtained by a standalone model and joint
training with another task or language. The number following
a task is the labeling rate (0.1 or 0.3). Eng and NER both refer
to English NER, Span means Spanish. In the column titles,
Task is the target task, J. Task is the jointly-trained task with
full labels, Sep. is the F1/Accuracy of the target task trained
separately, Joint is the F1/Accuracy of the target task with

We also use t-SNE (Van der Maaten and Hin-
ton, 2008) to obtain a 2-dimensional visualization
of the character-level GRU output for the coun-
try names in English and Spanish, shown in Fig-
ure 3. We can clearly see that our model cap-
tures the morphological similarity between two
languages through joint training, since all corre-
sponding pairs are nearest neighbors in the origi-
nal embedding space.

6 Conclusion

We presented a new model for sequence tagging
based on gated recurrent units and conditional ran-
dom ﬁelds. We explored multi-task and cross-
lingual joint training through sharing part of the
network architecture and model parameters. We
achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks
including POS tagging, chunking, and NER, in
multiple languages. We also demonstrated that
joint training can improve model performance in
various cases.

In this work, we mainly focus on leveraging
morphological similarities for cross-lingual joint
training. In the future, an important problem will
be joint training based on cross-lingual word se-
mantics with the help of parallel data. Further-
more,
it will be interesting to apply our joint
training approach to low-resource tasks and lan-
guages.
