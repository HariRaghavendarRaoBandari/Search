ABSTRACT

We investigate meson’s spectrum, decay constant and form factor in a nuclear medium through

holographic two- and three-point correlation functions. To describe a nuclear medium composed of

protons and neutrons, we consider a hard wall model on the thermal charged AdS geometry and

show that due to the isospin interaction with a nuclear medium, there exist splittings of the meson’s

spectrum, decay constant and form factor relying on the isospin charge. In addition, we show that

the ρ-meson’s form factor describing an interaction with pseudoscalar ﬂuctuation decreases when the

nuclear density increases, while the interaction with a longitudinal part of an axial vector meson

increases.

Introduction

For describing strongly interacting nuclear physics in a nuclear medium, it is important in order to

ﬁgure out low energy physics of QCD. However, since the traditional perturbation method of the

quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) does not work in a strong coupling regime, we need a new paradigm or

mathematical technique. In a medium, moreover, a numerical method called the lattice QCD suﬀers

from a sign problem. In this situation, the AdS/CFT correspondence [1] can shed light on accounting

for a strongly interacting nuclear medium.

Recently using the AdS/CFT correspondence, spectra of mesons and nucleons in the vaccum have

been studied in various holographic models, bottom-up and top-down models [2]-[22]. These works

were further generalized to the medium case [23, 24]. In the hard wall model, a thermal charged AdS

(tcAdS) geometry has been used as the gravity dual of a nuclear medium [25]-[31]. Though it contains

a singularity at the center, the IR cutoﬀ of the hard wall model prevents all physical quantities from

approaching to this singularity. Therefore, the tcAdS space is safe at least in the hard wall model.

A gauge ﬁeld ﬂuctuation on this background geometry is dual to a vector operator with a conformal

dimension 3, so it can be identiﬁed with a quark current [7]. Especially, its time component corresponds

to the quark density. The tcAdS geometry can be regarded as the dual of a conﬁning phase at low

temperature due to the IR cutoﬀ, while the deconﬁning phase is described by a charged black hole

geometry [23]. The Hawking-Page transition between these two geometries can be identiﬁed with

the deconﬁnement phase transition of the dual QFT [11]. In the conﬁning phase, the fundamental

excitations are not quarks but hadrons because of the conﬁniment. Thus, the holographic model

deﬁned on the tcAdS space would be helpful to understand hadronic physics in a nuclear medium like

a neutron star and nuclear physics in the strong coupling regime. In [25], various meson’s dispersion

relations and the decay constants in a nuclear medium have been studied, which was further generalized

to the nucleon’s cases [29]. These quantities related to two-point correlation functions represent

hadron’s spectrum and its stability. Another important thing to understand nuclear physics is a form

factor describing hadron’s interaction which is generally associated with a three-point correlation

function [32]-[40]. In this work, we will clarify the meson’s holographic two- and three-point functions

in a nuclear medium and study how they rely on the nuclear density and meson’s isospin charge.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: After brieﬂy summarizing the holographic dual of

the nuclear medium in Sec. 2, we investigate two-point functions of mesons in Sec. 3. We show that

a speciﬁc Dirichlet boundary condition at the asymptotic boundary is related to the pole structure of

the meson’s two-point function. Using the Sturm-Liouville theorem we obtain two-point functions of

vector and axial-vector mesons with a well deﬁned decay constants. We also discuss about pion’s decay

constants which are not clearly identiﬁed in a nuclear medium. In Sec. 4, we study the ρ-meson’s

form factors which are split because of the isospin interaction with the nuclear medium. We ﬁnish

this work with some concluding remarks in Sec. 5.

2 Holographic description for a nuclear medium

In general, a nuclear medium is a complex system including various nucleons and mesons together

with their nontrivial interactions. Although it is formidable to construct an exact gravity dual of such

a system, the AdS/CFT correspondence is still useful to understand qualitative features of a strongly

interacting system. In a holographic set-up, a nuclear medium can be imitated by an asymptotic AdS

geometry including corresponding dual bulk ﬁelds. Since a global symmetry of a QFT maps to a local

symmetry in the gravity dual, we should take into account an asymptotic AdS geometry involving at

least U (2) local gauge ﬁelds in order to describe a nuclear medium with two ﬂavor charges. The tcAdS

geometry has been regarded as such a dual for a nuclear medium [23, 25]. The action governing the

tcAdS space is given by

S =Z d5x√−G(cid:20) 1
where Λ = −6/R2 is a cosmological constant and the gauge ﬁeld strengths of U (2)L and U (2)R are

M N F (R)M N(cid:17) +|DM Φ|2 + m2 |Φ|2i ,

M N = ∂M LN − ∂N LM − i [LM , LN ] ,
F (R)
M N = ∂M RN − ∂N RM − i [RM , RN ] .

(2)

Here, we considered two kinds of ﬂavor group, U (2)L × U (2)R, in order to describe parity of hadrons
and also introduced a massive complex scalar ﬁeld with m2 = −3/R2 whose modulus represents the
chiral condensate [7]. A covariant derivative of Φ is deﬁned as

DM Φ = ∂M Φ − iLM Φ + iΦRM .

(3)

For describing a nuclear matter, it is suﬃcient to consider only the Cartan subgroups, U (1)2
L ×
U (1)2
R, because a nuclear medium can be classiﬁed by their quantum numbers. If we turn on only
time component gauge ﬁelds, they represent the quark number and isospin charge densities. Rewriting

them in terms of their symmetric and antisymmetric combinations the symmetric one represents a

parity even state, while the antisymmetric one describes a parity odd state. The lowest parity even

state is identiﬁed with a proton or neutron relying on the isospin charge. Since the parity even state

has lower energy than the parity odd state, the lowest parity even states, proton and neutron, are

usually the main ingredients of a nuclear medium at suﬃciently low energy scale. In the dual gravity,
it can be accomplished by taking Lt = Rt = −Vt [25]. Furthermore, since fundamental excitations
in the conﬁning phase are not quarks but nucleons, we need to rewrite quark’s quantities in terms of

nucleon’s ones. Using the conservation of the net quark number, the resulting tcAdS geometry with

two ﬂavor charges becomes

On this tcAdS space, the deconﬁnement phase transition, the symmetry energy and meson’s spectra

with a SU (2) ﬂavor charge have been studied in [25].

Before closing this section, it is worth noting that when a complex scalar ﬁeld Φ has a negative
mass, m2 = −3/R2, it is dual to the chiral condensate. More precisely, parameterizing the complex
scalar ﬁeld as

Φ = φ1 ei√2π,

φ describes the chiral condensate, while the SU (2) ﬂuctuation, π, corresponds to pseudoscalar meson,

the so-called pion. In the tcAdS space, the modulus satisfying the equation of motion is given by [?]

where mq and σ denotes the current quark mass and chiral condensate respectively and Nc denotes
the rank of the gauge group. The gravitational backreaction of the scalar ﬁeld slightly changes the

background geometry and gives rise to an 1/Nc correction [41]. From now on, we ignore such a
correction as usually done in the hard wall model.

3 Meson’s two-point function in a nuclear medium

In the vacuum dual to the thermal AdS geometry, meson’s masses in the conﬁning phase and the

deconﬁnement phase transition have been studied [7]. Mesons in the vacuum are degenerate and their

energy satisﬁes a relativistic dispersion relation, m =pω2 − |~p|2, due to the Lorentz symmetry of the

boundary space. In more details, if the IR cutoﬀ is ﬁxed, the meson’s dispersion relation is uniquely

determined by solving the equation of motion of the dual bulk ﬁeld with two appropriate boundary

conditions, a Neumann boundary condition at the IR cutoﬀ and a Dirichlet boundary condition at the

asymptotic boundary. The same dispersion relation naturally appears as a pole of a meson’s two-point

function. Since the analytic solution of ρ-meson in the thermal AdS space has been known as Bessel

functions [7], its exact two-point function is also known. By using the Kneser-Sommerfeld expansion

(see [32] and references therein), the two-point function of ρ-meson with the Lorentzian signature can

where D(n), p(n) and m(n) are the decay constant, boundary four momentum and mass of the n-th

a pole at the n-th resonance frequency, ω(n) = qp2

When a particle moves in a medium, its dispersion relation is aﬀected from the interaction with a

medium. Due to this reason, one can easily expect that the meson’s dispersion relation in a nuclear

medium is deviated from a relativistic one [25]. To understand the medium eﬀect more precisely, let

us consider the following Fourier mode expansion

on-shell gravity action. On the dual ﬁeld theory side, it corresponds to the contact term and should
be renormalized by adding proper counter terms. From now on, assume that c0

appropriate renormalization scheme. In order to ﬁx two integral constants, we impose the following

boundary conditions

free parameters, Q, D, ω and p, the solution usually depends on them. To satisfy the given boundary

conditions, these parameters have to satisfy a speciﬁc relation which is nothing but the dispersion

relation.

Let us investigate a two-point function in the nuclear medium in more details. Since the analytic

solution of (12) is not known, one can not directly applied to the Kneser-Sommerfeld expansion unlike

the vacuum case.

In spite of this fact, one can ﬁnd a similar two-point function form even in the

nuclear medium. To see this, we ﬁrst calculate the on-shell gravity action in the momentum space

(17)

It shows that we have to take c0
1m = 0 for obtaining resonances. From now on, we drop out indices
indicating the boundary coordinates for simplicity. Near a resonance frequency, the boundary value

of the mode function can be expanded into

(18)

where N is introduced for a normalization and the medium eﬀect is usually encoded into an n-th
resonance frequency (or energy), Σ0
(n). This relation shows that the boundary value of ρ0 out of an
exact resonance frequency does not vanish, so the resonances appear only on speciﬁc frequencies.

From these results, the dominant contribution to the two-point function near ω ≈ ω(n) becomes

Following the Sturm-Liouville theorem, a general two-point function can be rewritten as the sum of

The two-point function of ρ0-meson has a similar form to that in the vacuum. Its pole represents
a dispersion relation of the n-th resonance consistent with the solution of (12). However, due to

the interaction with a medium, the dispersion relation in a nuclear medium cannot be written as a
n + m2. There exists an alternative way to derive (22) following the

(n)(cid:17)2

prescriptions used in [7], which also gives rise to the exact same result.

In a nuclear medium, calculating the two-point function of axial-vector mesons is parallel to the vector

meson case, so we skip the details.

medium are summarized as [25]

Unlike the vector and axial vector mesons, pions are described two ﬁelds, χ and π. π corresponds to a

ﬂuctuation of a pseudoscalar ﬁeld, while χ comes from the longitudinal mode of the axial-vector ﬁeld.
In the chiral limit (mπ = 0), the pion decay constant in the vacuum is deﬁned as h0|J a
m|πi = iDπpm
where J a
m indicates an axial-vector current [7]. Due to this relation, the decay constant of pion is
usually evaluated from the two-point function of a1-meson. In the holographic point of view, this is
reasonable because π = 0 becomes a solution in the chiral limit and at the same time χ satisﬁes the

same equation of axial-vector meson. In a nuclear medium, however, this is not the case because of
a nontrivial isospin interaction with the background matter. Even in the chiral limit, π± = 0 is not
a solution and the equation for χ does not reduce to that of axial-vector meson. These facts imply

that we need a new method to deﬁne pion’s decay constant in the nuclear medium. We leave it as

a future work. Although the pion’s decay constant is not well deﬁned in the nuclear medium [42],

two-point functions of π and χ should have the same dispersion relation. In the nuclear medium, we

depict energies and decay constant of ρ-mesons and pions with a speciﬁc momentum preserving SO(2)

rotation symmetry (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). In Fig. 1, note that due to the diﬀerent origins of π and

χ we used diﬀerent normalizations

which is important to determine the ρ-meson’s form factor correctly in the next section.

In general, neutron in a nuclear medium is more stable than proton because of the electric interac-
tion of protons. Therefore, the neutron dominant case (α < 0) is more physical. When α = −1/2, the
nuclear medium we considered is composed of 75% neutrons and 25% protons. In this case, the energy

of a negatively charged meson is usually larger than that of a positively charged meson because of

the isospin interaction with the nuclear medium as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, their energy always

increases as shown in Fig. 2. In general, there also exists the splitting of the decay constant in the

nuclear medium [29]. However, since we have taken into account only a small Q range in Fig. 2, the

splitting of the decay constant is negligible.

ρ-meson’s form factor

Following the AdS/CFT correspondence, bosonic bulk ﬂuctuations map to various mesons of the dual

ﬁeld theory. Their interactions can be studied from higher point correlation functions. On the gravity

side, those n-point functions are described by interactions of dual bulk ﬂuctuations. Since pions and

ρ-mesons have relatively smaller mass than others, they are usually dominant in the low energy physics

and play a crucial role in understanding the strongly interacting nuclear matter. In this section, we

will focus on the form factor of ρ-mesons in the nuclear medium. This work can be easily extended to

other massive mesons like a1-meson and higher resonances.

The form factor can be read from the three-point function, so that it is required to expand the

bulk action into cubic order. Terms related to ρ-meson at cubic order are given by

Recall that variables with the tilde symbol indicate mesons in the dual ﬁeld theory and ones without

tilde correspond to their mode functions in the dual gravity.

In order to see the medium eﬀect on the ρ-meson form factor, we simplify the situation. Let
us consider a ρ-meson moving along the z-direction with the momentum parameterized by ~ka
m =
{0, 0,−2kz}, which breaks the SO(3) rotational symmetry into SO(2). In addition, let us consider
pions preserving the remaining SO(2) symmetry for simplicity. Then, the momentum conservation
implies that two pions have the momenta, ~kb
z + kc
z.
Let us further assume that two pions have the same momentum along the z-direction, kb
z = kz.
Then, the form factor we are interested in can be parameterized by kb and kz only. Finally the form
factors are reduced to

In Fig. 3, we depict the ρ-meson form

factors depending on the nuclear medium properties with a ﬁxed momenta, kz = 0.01 and k = 0.04.
Intriguingly, Fπ and Fχ show totally diﬀerent behaviors. When the nuclear density increases the form
factors of ρ and π decreases, while the form factors of ρ and χ increases.

Following the AdS/CFT correspondence, the results obtained here can be regarded as the ones

including all quantum eﬀects. In this sense, the form factor may be regarded as a non-perturbative

eﬀective coupling constant between ρ-meson and pions in the nuclear medium. If ignoring the isospin

eﬀect, the form factors of ρ-mesons become degenerate. In other words, there is no distinct between

the form factors of neutral and charged ρ-mesons. Turning on the isospin eﬀect, the split of the form
factors occurs as expected (see Fig. 3). For α = −1/2, the interaction between a negatively charged
ρ-meson and π is stronger than that between a positively charged ρ-meson and π. On the contrary,

factor of a neutral ρ-meson, whereas a dotted (blue) and dashed (red) curves indicate those of a negatively and
positively charged ρ-meson respectively.

the interaction between a negatively charged ρ-mesion and χ becomes weaker than that of a positive

ρ-meson.

5 Discussion

In this work, we have investigated meson’s two-point functions and form factors in a nuclear medium.

Imposing the Dirchlet boundary condition on the dual bulk ﬁeld at the asymptotic boundary describes

the pole structure of the meson’s two-point function. Although the analytic solution of the dual bulk

ﬁeld is not known in the nuclear medium, the Sturm-Liouville theorem allows us to write the vector and

axial-vector meson’s two-point function with a well-deﬁned decay constant. In a vacuum, the pion’s

decay constant can be evaluated by that of the axial-vector meson in the chiral and zero momentum

limit where axial-vector meson and pion satisfy the same equation of motion. In a nuclear medium,

however, they interact with the nuclear medium diﬀerently. Due to this reason, the pion’s decay

constant is not well deﬁned from the axial-vector’s one even in the chiral and zero momentum limit.

It would be interesting to ﬁnd a new method to deﬁne the pion’s decay constant in a nuclear medium.

It has been shown that the isospin interaction of mesons with the nuclear medium causes the

mass splitting depending on their isospin charges. In this work, we have also shown that ρ-meson’s

form factors are also split in the nuclear medium. When the nucleon’s density of the nuclear medium

increases the form factor, Fρππ, between ρ and π decreases, while Fρχχ increases.
