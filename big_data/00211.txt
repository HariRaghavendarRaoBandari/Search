On the Statistical Performance of the Generalized

Power Method for Angular Synchronization

Abstract

The problem of angular synchronization with its numerous applica-
tions has attracted intense research recent years. Motivated by its optimal
estimation error in the sense of Cram´er-Rao inequality, two approaches
have been recently developed to compute the maximum likelihood esti-
mator. One is the semideﬁnite relaxation and the other is to directly
solve the non-convex maximum likelihood optimization by the general-
ized power method. In this paper, we focus on the latter and take a new
perspective by directly studying the estimation error of the iterates. We
show that the ℓ2- and ℓ∞-errors decrease geometrically as the algorithm
proceeds. In particular, the ℓ2-error decreases to the Cram´er-Rao lower
bound, under the least restrictive noise level requirement compared with
prior works.

1 Introduction

The problem of angular synchronization is that of estimating a collection of n
phases1 based on noisy measurements of pairwise relative phases. Formally, let
z ∈ Tn = {w ∈ Cn : |w1| = ··· = |wn| = 1} be a phase vector of interest, the
task is to determine z from the noisy measurements:

Ckℓ = zkzℓ + ∆kℓ,

for all k 6= ℓ,

where ∆kℓ is the noise. Since the measurements Ckl are invariant when a com-
mon phase is multiplied to the signal, z is identiﬁable only up to a global phase.

vector to a complex vector whose entries are all phases.

Despite the simple description of angular synchronization, it has numerous ap-
plications including time-synchronization of distributed networks [10], phaseless
reconstruction [16], ranking [8] and surface reconstruction problems in computer
vision [1], to name a few, and attracted intense research recent years. For more
background on angular synchronization, readers are referred to [2] and the ref-
erences therein.

In this paper, we focus on the scenario where each ∆kℓ is an i.i.d. random
variable distributed according to the standard complex Gaussian distribution
with variance σ2. Letting W be a Wigner matrix — i.e. a Hermitian random
matrix with all above-diagonal entries being i.i.d. standard complex normal ran-
dom variables and all diagonal entries zeros — the measurements can be written
compactly as C = zz∗ + σW . Under this Gaussian noise setting, the Cram´er-
Rao bound [4, 11, 5] implies that the expected squared ℓ2-error of any unbiased
estimator is at least Ω(σ2). Therefore, one should focus on ﬁnding estimators
that match this information-theoretic lower bound. One such example is the
maximum likelihood estimator zMLE associated with angular synchronization,
which is a globally optimal solution to the following optimization problem:

maximize x∗Cx
subject to x ∈ Tn.

(QP)

The following lemma proved in [2, Lemma 4.1] conﬁrms the quality of zMLE.
Lemma 1. If x ∈ Cn satisﬁes kxk2
is a global optimizer of (QP)), then

2 = n and z∗Cz ≤ x∗Cx (in particular, if x

min

θ∈R kxeiθ − zk2 =p2(n − |z∗x|) ≤

4σkWkop√n

.

Since E[kWk2
and it is optimal from the information-theoretic point of view.

op] = O(n), the expected squared ℓ2-error of zMLE is of order O(σ2)

In view of the above discussion, we are interested in designing eﬃcient
methods for computing the global optimizer of (QP). Unfortunately, the prob-
lem is non-convex and NP-hard [17], rendering the non-existence of algorithm
that can solve arbitrary instance in polynomial time. If we accept a small fail-
ure probability, eﬃcient methods exist though. Bandeira et al.
[2] shows that
if σ = O(n1/4), then with high probability the standard semideﬁnite relaxation
of (QP) is tight (i.e. has unique rank-1 solution) and hence we can extract the
desired estimator zMLE from the rank-1 optimizer of the semideﬁnite program.
Since the dimension of the computation is lifted from O(n) to O(n2), this is
particularly slow in practice.

In a very recent paper [4], Boumal proposed to use the generalized power
method (GPM) [12, 14] to solve (QP) and proved that if σ = O(n1/6), then
with high probability the suitably initialized GPM converges to the unique (up
to a global phase) optimizer of (QP). The computational cost of this approach
is much lower than that of solving a semideﬁnite program. However, the result
applies only under a more restrictive requirement on the noise level and the

2

convergence rate of GPM is unknown. Experiments in [2, 4] indicate that in
both approaches, the transition from almost-sure success recovery of zMLE to
almost-sure failure occurs at the edge of σ = ˜O(n1/2). However, the authors
were not able to prove their respective observations. Both analyses are hindered
by the usage of a suboptimal estimate [4, Lemma 12], see also [2, Remark 4.6].
In this paper, instead of computing zMLE, we take a new perspective and
ask the following question, which more directly relates angular synchronization
to GPM:

Question (Q): How does the estimation error change as the GPM proceeds?
As our main results, we prove that if σ = O(n1/2), the ℓ2-error and ℓ∞-error of
the iterates decrease geometrically to O(σ) and O(√log n + σ)σn−1/2), respec-
tively. Quite surprisingly, this implies that the iterates of GPM will eventually
be as good as zMLE in the sense of maximum likelihood for the problem of an-
gular synchronization, regardless of whether the iterates of GPM converge to a
single point.

We end this section by introducing the notations needed. For w ∈ C, w
denotes its complex conjugate and |w| = √ww it modulus. For vector v ∈ Cn, v∗
denotes its conjugate transpose, kvkq =Pj |vj|q its ℓq-norm for 1 ≤ q < ∞ and
kvk∞ = maxj |vj|. Furthermore, |v| denotes its vector of entry-wise modulus
and v
|v|

its vector of entry-wise modulus-normalization, i.e.

|y|j = |yj| and (cid:18) y
|y|(cid:19)j

,

=( yj

|yj|
0,

if yj 6= 0,
otherwise.

For a complex matrix M ∈ Cn×n, M∗ denotes its Hermitian transpose, kMkop
its operator norm and kMkF its Frobenius norm. 1n denotes the n-dimensional
vector of all ones.

2 Main Results

Following its success in solving sparse principal component analysis [12], we
consider solving (QP) by the generalized power method (Algorithm 1). This is
also recently proposed by Boumal [4]. However, in [4] there is an upper bound on
the choice of αk that depends on λmin(C). Here, we do not have such limitation.
This slight diﬀerence saves us from computing or estimating the least eigenvalue
of C. As pointed out in [4, Remark 1], Algorithm 1 is essentially the same as a
gradient-project scheme commonly used for manifold optimizations. Therefore,
we interpret the parameter αk as the step-size henceforth.

Due to the non-convexity of (QP), it is expected that GPM will not con-
verge to any useful points in general. To avoid GPM from converging to those
unfavorable local points, a proper initialization is in order. In this paper, we
consider the same spectral initialization as in [4]. Speciﬁcally, let u be the

3

dominant eigenvector of C. We initialize GPM by vC :

(vC )j =( uj

,
|uj|
uT 1
|uT 1|

,

if uj 6= 0,
otherwise.

(1)

Motivated by Question (Q), we study the ℓ2- and ℓ∞-errors of the iterates of
GPM and establish a more straightforward relationship between the iterates and
the true signal z. In a nutshell, we prove that with the initialization x0 = vC ,
it holds with high probability that the sequence of iterates generated by GPM
will eventually enter a small neighborhood around the true signal z and the size
of the neighborhood is determined by σ.
Theorem 1. Let z ∈ Cn be a phase vector, W be an n × n Wigner matrix,
σ > 0, and C = zz∗ + σW . Let {xk} be the sequence of iterates generated by
√n
48 , then it holds with
Algorithm 1 with constant step-size α > 4. Suppose σ ≤
probability at least 1 − 2n−5/4 − e−n/2 − e−3n/2 that for k = 1, 2, . . . ,

where

and c1 = min

θ∈[0,2π)kx0 − eiθzk2.

Theorem 2. Under the same conditions as in Theorem 1, it holds with proba-
bility at least 1 − 2n−5/4 − e−n/2 − e−3n/2 that for k = 1, 2, . . . ,

Note that Theorem 1 provides an alternative to achieve the information-theoretic
lower bound under the less restrictive noise level requirement σ = O(n1/2) com-
pared with [2] and [4]. In particular, it shows that as long as k is suﬃciently
large, the ℓ2-error of xk as an estimator for the angular synchronization will
be as good as zMLE. Incidentally, Theorems 1 and 2 also recover the results of
[2, Lemma 3.2] up to constants. Here, we remark that the lower bounds of the
step-size α can be loosened by bootstrapping the argument in the proofs.

Lemma 2. For any complex vector x ∈ Cn and phase vector z ∈ Cn, we have

|x| − zkq ≤ 2kx − zkq.
Proof. By the deﬁnition of x
, it suﬃces to show that for j = 1, . . . , n,
|x|

If xj = 0, the inequality holds trivially. So we focus on the case xj 6= 0. We
claim that

≤ 2|xj − 1|.

|eiφ − 1| ≤ 2|reiφ − 1|

for any φ ∈ [0, 2π) and r ≥ 0.

To prove this, we consider the minimization

Combining the two cases, the proof is completed.

We will also need the following lemma in the proofs of our main results,

which shows that the noise matrix W is non-adversarial.
Lemma 3. Let z ∈ Cn be a phase vector and W be an n × n Wigner matrix.
Then kWkop ≤ 3√n, kW zk∞ ≤ 3√n log n and kW zk2 ≤ 3n with probability at
least 1 − 2n−5/4 − e−n/2 − e−3n/2.
Proof. By [2, Proposition 3.3], we only need to prove probability bound for the
third event. Note that we can assume without loss of generality that z = 1n.
From the deﬁnition of Wigner matrices, the random variable kW 1nk2

In this paper, we study the problem of angular synchronization from a new
perspective by tackling a question more directly related to the statistical per-
formance of the iterates of GPM. We prove that if σ = O(n1/2), then with
high probability the ℓ2- and ℓ∞-errors decrease geometrically to O(σ) and
O((√log n + σ)σn−1/2), respectively. In particular, this provides an alternative
to obtain an estimator that achieves the optimal estimation performance in the
information-theoretic sense and the noise level requirement is least restrictive
compared with prior works. Our analysis is novel and does not rely on optimal-
ity conditions. We believe that the techniques will ﬁnd further applications in
the algorithmic analysis of statistical recovery problems.

Another recovery problem closely related to angular synchronization is
phase retrieval (also known as phaseless reconstruction) [9, 3, 6, 7]. A ba-
sic version of the problem is to recover the signal x ∈ Cn given a collection
of m measurements bj = |a∗j x| for j = 1, . . . , m. The measurement vectors
{aj}m
j=1 are known and can either be random or deterministic. Similar to angu-
lar synchronization, phase retrieval admits a natural non-convex optimization
formulation. Recently, Sun et al. [15] showed that when m = Ω(n log3 n), this
non-convex optimization has no spurious local optimizers, and x is the only

9

global optimizer (up to a global phase). Combining the result of [15], the em-
pirical observation of [4] as mentioned in the introduction and our results in
this paper, we conjecture that if σ = O(n1/2), then (QP) has no spurious local
maximizers, and z is the only global maximizer (up to a global phase).
