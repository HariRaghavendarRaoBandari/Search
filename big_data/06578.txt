ABSTRACT

We present 947 radial velocities of RR Lyrae variable stars in four ﬁelds located toward the Galactic
bulge, observed within the data from the ongoing Bulge RR Lyrae Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA-
RR). We show that these RR Lyrae stars exhibit hot kinematics and null or negligible rotation and
are therefore members of a separate population from the bar/pseudobulge that currently dominates
the mass and luminosity of the inner Galaxy. Our RR Lyrae stars predate these structures, and
have metallicities, kinematics, and spatial distribution that are consistent with a “classical” bulge,
although we cannot yet completely rule out the possibility that they are the metal-poor tail of a more
metal rich ([Fe/H]∼−1 dex) halo-bulge population. The complete catalog of radial velocities for the
BRAVA-RR stars is also published electronically.

1. INTRODUCTION

The majority of massive galaxies (> 109M⊙), similar to
the Milky Way, have a distinct rise in surface brightness
above the disk, referred to as a bulge (Fisher & Drory
2011). Galaxy bulges are observed to either rotate
rapidly like a disk, and are generally referred to as pseu-
dobulges, or they are dominated by random motions and
are therefore pressure supported by a central velocity
dispersion. This latter type is referred to as a classi-
cal bulge (e.g., Kormendy & Illingworth 1982). That
not all bulges are alike suggests that the bulge type
of a galaxy carries signiﬁcance for the galaxy’s evolu-
tionary history, such as its merger history and star for-
mation eﬃciency (e.g., Martig et al. 2012; Obreja et al.
2013; Fiacconi et al. 2015). The properties of the bulge
in our Galaxy are therefore, a fundamental parameter
with which to understand the formation of the Milky
Way.

The ﬁrst wide-area spectroscopic surveys of the Milky
Way bulge have shown that it consists of a massive bar
rotating as a solid body (Rich et al. 2007; Kunder et al.
2012; Ness et al. 2013; Zoccali et al. 2014). The internal

kinematics of these stars are consistent with at least 90%
of the inner Galaxy being part of a pseudobulge and lack-
ing a pressure supported, classical-like bulge (Shen et al.
2010; Ness et al. 2013). Recent studies have indicated a
bimodal nature of bulges – that two bulge populations,
likened to classical and pseudo-bulges, can exist within a
galaxy, with diﬀerences being in the relative proportions
of the two (Obreja et al. 2013; Fisher & Drory 2016).
There has accordingly been considerable debate about
whether there is room for a classical component in the
bulge (Babusiaux et al. 2010; Zoccali et al. 2008).

The oldest and most metal poor stars (which may trace
the dark matter) are thought to be found in the cen-
ter of the Galaxy – in the bulge but not sharing its
kinematics and abundance patterns (Tumlinson 2010).
Therefore, perhaps the greatest possibility of uncover-
ing a classical component would be within the metal-
poor bulge stars. Unfortunately, spectroscopic surveys
studying thousands of giants and red clump stars in
the bulge have found that metal-poor stars in the bulge
are rare, greatly limiting the use of metal-poor stars
to uncover and probe a possible classical bulge com-
ponent (Ness et al. 2013; Casey & Schlaufmann 2015;
Howes et al. 2015; Koch et al. 2016). Perhaps the eas-
iest identiﬁable old, metal-poor bulge population are
those horizontal branch stars that pulsate as RR Lyrae
stars (RRLs). Since the absolute brightness of RRLs
are known to within ∼10%, the discovery of a signiﬁ-
cant population of RRLs toward the bulge permitted the
ﬁrst distance determination to the Galactic center from
a stellar population (Baade 1946).

In this paper, we report on the kinematics of a large
sample of these stars in the Galactic bulge ﬁeld. Our
sample consists of RRLs with Galactocentric distances
within ∼10% of the distance of the Sun to the galactic
center, so our sample represents the typical “bulge” RRL
population.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND RADIAL VELOCITY

Observations were performed using the AAOmega
multi-ﬁber spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Tele-

2

Kunder et al.

scope (AAT) on May 2013, June 2013, June 2014 and
August 2015, in dual beam mode centered on 8600˚A,
with the 580V and 1700D gratings to probe the Calcium
Triplet (NOAO PropID: 2014A-0143; PI: A. Kunder and
NOAO PropID: 2015B-071; PI: A. Kunder). This covers
the wavelength regime of about 8300˚A to 8800˚A at a res-
olution of R∼10,000. Exposure times were between one
to two hours, and in general there are between 2 and 5
epochs for each RRL. The 2013 observations were carried
out in conjunction with a bulge survey designed for de-
tached red giant eclipsing binary twins (AAT: 2013A-05;
PI: D. Nataf). Extra ﬁbers were available and resource-
fully allocated to 95 bulge RRLs, and these RRLs have
up to 15 epochs of observations.

The OGLE-III catalogue of RRLs (Pietrukowicz et al.
2012) was used to select the targets. We observed all
bulge fundamental mode RRLs (RR0 Lyrae stars) that
were free of a companion within a 2 arc second radius
in our four ﬁelds. These have been phased by the stars
known period, and over-plotted with the radial velocity
template from Liu (1991) (Figure 1). This template is
scaled using a correlation between the amplitudes of ve-
locity curves and light curve:

Arv =

40.5 × Vamp + 42.7

1.37

(1)

as shown in Liu (1991). Because the I-amplitude of the
OGLE stars is known much more precisely than the V -
amplitude, we use the relation Vamp = Iamp x 1.6 to ﬁnd
each stars V -amplitude (see e.g., Table 3 in Kunder et al.
2013). The so-called “projection factor” p= 1.37 is neces-
sary because Liu (1991) uses pulsation velocities, which
are related to observed radial velocities as vobs = vpuls/p.
The projection factor p can range from 1.31 to 1.37 (Liu
1991; Kovacs 2003), and we adopted p= 1.37 as in Sesar
(2012).

Due to our sampling techniques, almost all of our stars
have at least two spectra at diﬀerent phases, which fa-
cilitates the ﬁtting of a radial velocity curve to the mea-
surements. The zero-point in phase is ﬁxed using the
time of maximum brightness as reported by OGLE-IV
(Soszy’nski et al. 2014) and the pulsation curve is shifted
in radial velocity until it matches the observations. More
weight is given to points that fall between φ =0.0 - 0.6, as
this is where the uncertainty in the radial velocity shape
of the template is minimised (see, e.g., Fig. 1 in Sesar
2012). More weight is also given to the observations with
a higher signal-to-noise, which also generally occurs be-
tween φ =0.0 - 0.6. The star’s time-averaged velocity
is determined by ﬁnding the velocity at φobs=0.38 (Liu
1991).

We use 24 RRLs with well derived radial velocities
to investigate how 2-3 epochs per light curve aﬀect our
center-of-mass radial velocities. The 24 RRLs are listed
in Table 1, and span a wide range of metallicities, pul-
sation periods and amplitudes. Because these 24 RRLs
have individual radial velocity uncertainties that are ∼1
km s−1, we ﬁrst assign each radial velocity measure-
ment a Gaussian uncertainty distribution of 4 km s−1,
to simulate the typical errors from the observed BRAVA-
RR observations. We then use the Liu (1991) template
and decrease the number of epochs from ∼100 to 2 and
measure how the center-of-mass radial velocity changes.

In general, the center-of-mass radial velocity changes by
∼2 km s−1 or less; only in the unusual cases where there
were no epochs between φ =0.0 - 0.6, but instead the
observations fell on the rising branch at phases greater
than 0.85, did the center-of-mass radial velocity change
by ∼5 km s−1.

Similar results have been shown previously; for exam-
ple, Jeﬀery et al. (2007) showed that center-of-mass ra-
dial velocities have a typical uncertainty of ±1.5 km s−1
for variables observed at least three times when using the
Liu (1991) template. A visual inspection of the radial ve-
locity curves of the 63 BRAVA-RR stars with 10 or more
epochs of observations also indicates that the Liu (1991)
template is suﬃcient to within 5 - 10 km−1 to obtain
a center-of-mass radial velocity. Indeed, it is impressive
how well the radial velocity template ﬁts to the diverse
RRLs listed in Table 1. We note that 87% of our BRAVA-
RR stars have 3 or more epochs of observations, making
it statistically unlikely that the BRAVA-RR stars do not
have observations in the regime where the template most
accurately aligns with the observed radial velocity mea-
surements. Therefore, our center-of-mass radial velocity
uncertainties are 5-10 km s−1.

Figure 1 shows example pulsation curves for the RRLs
– in particular, we show is those with the most extreme
radial velocities to illustrate this is a kinematically hot
population. Table 2 gives the OGLE-ID (1), the RA
(2) and Dec (3) as provided by OGLE, the star’s time-
average velocity (4), the number of epochs used for the
star’s time-average velocity (5), the period of the star (6),
the V -band magnitude (7), the I-band magnitude (8)
and the I-band amplitude (9) as calculated by OGLE,
and lastly the photometric metallicity from the OGLE
I-band light curve (10).

3. DISCUSSION

3.1. Rotation curve

From spectroscopic observations of 947 RRLs in four
3 sq. deg. ﬁelds located toward the bulge we plot the
mean radial velocity and velocity dispersion for RRLs as
a function of position (galactic latitude and longitude)
in Figure 2. These are found to be radically diﬀerent
from the trends traced by the more metal-rich red giants
in the BRAVA and GIBS surveys (Kunder et al. 2012;
Zoccali et al. 2014) as the RRLs show null rotation and
hot (high velocity dispersion) kinematics. In the ARGOS
survey one observes a slowly-rotating metal-poor popu-
lation (Ness et al. 2013), which is hypothesized to arise
from stellar contamination from disk and halo stars, as
it is only seen at high galactic latitude. In contrast, our
stars are at low galactic latitudes and their more certain
distance estimates indicate they are within 1 kpc of the
Galactic center, where the surface-density of bulge stars
is usually dominant compared to the disk and halo. We
conclude that we are tracing an older, more spheroidal
component in the inner Galaxy that may be likened to a
classical bulge.

3.2. Metallicity distribution

The [Fe/H] metallicity distribution in our sample spans
three orders of magnitude, with spectroscopic metal-
licities derived from the Calcium Triplet 8498 ˚A line
(Wallerstein et al. 2012) ranging from −2.5 to super-

solar metallicities, peaking at [Fe/H]∼−1 dex. There-
fore, as shown previously (Walker & Terndrup 1991), the
bulge ﬁeld RRLs are on average ∼1 dex more metal-poor
than ‘normal’ bar stars, yet some of the bulge ﬁeld RRLs
have metallicities that overlap in abundance with the bar
population. The bulge ﬁeld RRLs are also more metal-
rich than the stellar halo (e.g., An et al. 2013), although
the metallicity gradient observed in the ﬁeld RRLs is
consistent with an inner bulge-halo at distances closer to
the Galactic center being more metal-rich (Suntzeﬀ et al.
1991).

None of the bulge ﬁeld RRL are extremely metal
poor, in contrast with what is predicted from a very old
inner-halo (Tumlinson 2010; Howes et al. 2015) there is
presently no indication for many stars in our sample with
[Fe/H] < −3, although the evolutionary tracks for such
metal poor stars may make it less likely for them to tra-
verse through the instability strip, thus becoming an RR
Lyrae star (e.g., Lee et al. 1994, see their Figure 1). The
large metallicity spread is suggestive of multiple popula-
tions within the bulge ﬁeld RRL sample (Lee et al. 2015).
In Figure 2, it is clear that the metal-rich RRLs have
a smaller dispersion compared to the more metal-poor
stars, which indicates there were likely various RRL for-
mation mechanisms in the bulge. This might plausibly be
related to the two distinct bulge ﬁeld RRL sequences in
the period-amplitude diagram (Pietrukowicz et al. 2015)
as well as the suggestion that only in the most central
part (inner 1 kpc) of the bulge do the RRLs exhibit
a weak bar-like substructure (Pietrukowicz et al. 2012;
D´ek´any et al. 2013).

We note that the BRAVA-RR spectroscopic metallic-
ities are still being ﬁnalized, and this will be the topic
of a subsequent BRAVA-RR paper. Therefore through-
out this paper we use photometric metallicities obtained

from a linear metallicity relationship in the pulsational
period and phase diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and third
harmonic φ31 (where φnm = mφn − nφm) in a Fourier
decomposition of the OGLE I-band lightcurves (Smolec
2005). These photometric metallicites are placed on the
Carretta et al. (2009) metallicity scale. The plots, how-
ever, does not change signiﬁcantly when using our pre-
liminary CaT abundances.

3.3. Mass estimate

We can estimate the mass of the ’old’ inner Galaxy
component by comparing the relative numbers of red
clump giants (metal rich horizontal branch stars) and
RRLs in the OGLE-III survey (Pietrukowicz et al. 2012;
Nataf et al. 2013). Here we assume that all the red
clump stars are part of the rotating bar, whereas all the
RRL are part of a non-rotating component (e.g., a clas-
sical bulge). We also presume that RRLs have the same
lifetime as red clump stars and were formed from stel-
lar populations with the same IMF as the red clump
stars. The kinematically hot component we recover in
this paper then amounts to ∼1% of the total central
mass. A similar mass is calculated from the fuel con-
sumption theorem (Renzini & Buzzoni 1986), assuming
again all the RRL are part of a non-rotating compo-
nent and have a narrow range in age. This is broadly
consistent with current bulge formation models, which
predict that no more than ∼5% of a merger-generated
bulge, which is slowly rotating and dispersion-supported,
may exist within the Milky Way bulge (Shen et al. 2010;
Ness et al. 2013; Di Matteo et al. 2015). Although such
a small mass may pose a challenge in understanding
how this central component could remain stationary in
the much more massive bar potential (Saha & Gerhard
2013), some dynamical studies do suggest that a hot pop-

4

1989).
It appears that in the RRL population toward
the Galactic bulge, we can observe a distinct stage of
the formation of the inner Galaxy that was antecedent
to the formation of the bar. This is in agreement with
an axisymmetric geometry described using near-infrared
VVV observations (D´ek´any et al. 2013), and is in con-
trast to the view provided from optical OGLE photom-
etry in which the RRLs appear to follow the elongated
spatial distribution of the bar (Pietrukowicz et al. 2015).
The diﬀerent kinematics of the “bulge” ﬁeld RRLs
and the majority of the bulge giants supports the claim
that galaxies may harbor two populations in the inner
Galaxy, which may be likened to classical and pseudob-
ulges, with diﬀerences being with the fraction of the two
(Obreja et al. 2013). Within the RRLs population to-
ward the direction of the bulge, we can probe an early
epoch inner Galaxy that was formed before the massive
disk secularly evolved into the bar. Detailed models of
the halo, thick disk and bulge components ∼1 kpc from
the Galactic center, an understanding of the elemental
abundances of the RRLs, as well as a large sample of ac-
curate proper motions for our BRAVA-RR stars, will help
distinguish if the “bulge” RRLs reside in a classical-like
bulge, or are part of a diﬀerent Milky Way component,
such as a metal-rich inner halo-bulge.

ulation is only weakly aﬀected, if at all, by the bar dy-
namics (Minchev et al. 2012).

3.4. Interpretation

Our velocities rule out that possibility that the major-
ity of RRL in the direction of the bulge are part of the
bar. Given the ages of RRLs (Walker 1989; Lee et al.
1992), this indicates that the inner Galaxy component
traced out by the BRAVA-RR stars is at least ∼1 Gyr
older than the dominant bar population.

It may be that the RRL stars toward the bulge are
actually an inner halo-bulge sample, as originally spec-
ulated in the early 1990s (e.g., Minniti 1994) and as at
least one RRL orbit toward the Galactic bulge seems to
indicate (Kunder et al. 2015). However, the velocity dis-
persion of the bulge RRLs is ∼10 km s−1 larger than that
seen in both the local RRL halo sample (Layden 1994;
Beers et al. 2000) and from other halo star samples (e.g.
Battaglia et al. 2006; Brown et al. 2009). In fact, we are
not aware of any other stellar population in the galaxy
with a larger velocity dispersion than that of the BRAVA-
RR stars. The decrease in velocity dispersion with metal-
licity (seen in Figure 2 and Figure 3) is also characteris-
tic of stars located in the bulge regions (e.g., Rich et al.
1990; Johnson et al. 2011; Babusiaux et al. 2010).
In
contrast, the velocity dispersion of halo stars either does
not change (e.g., Norris 1986), or does not change as sig-
niﬁcantly (e.g., Chiba & Beers 2000; Kaﬂe et al. 2013)
as a function of metal-abundance. A comparison of ve-
locity dispersion with [Fe/H] for the BRAVA-RR stars
and for the halo RRL star sample of Layden (1994)
and Beers et al. (2000) is shown explicitly in Figure 3
(left panel).
If the RRL stars toward the bulge are
an inner halo-bulge population, this component would
be the most metal-rich halo population identiﬁed in
the Galaxy, with a mean [Fe/H]∼−1 dex, compared to
the inner halo ([Fe/H]∼−1.6 dex) and the outer halo
([Fe/H]∼−2.2 dex) (e.g., An et al. 2013).

Recent studies have indicated that a kinematically
warmer component associated with the Galactic thick
disk could be present in the bulge, and would not be part
of the bar structure traced out by the majority of the
bulge red giants (e.g., Di Matteo et al. 2015). We there-
fore veriﬁed if the bulge RRLs have properties that could
link them to the thick disk. However, as seen in Figure 3
(left panel), OGLE-II proper motions (Sumi et al. 2004)
of our observed RRLs set them apart from that of the
disk, not surprising, as it is known that only ∼20% of
RRLs in the Milky Way reside in the (thick) disk (Layden
1995). Figure 3 also illustrates how the period distribu-
tion of the bulge ﬁeld RRLs is shifted to longer peri-
ods in comparison to the RRL kinematically identiﬁed
by Layden (1994, 1995) as belonging to the thick disk.
Although the local thick disk sample is small (37 stars
total), from an RRL pulsational tagging stand point it
appears unlikely that the BRAVA-RR component was
formed in a similar manner to that of the Milky Way
thick disk.

4. CONCLUSIONS

It has proven extremely diﬃcult to disentangle the for-
mation history of the inner Galaxy. RRLs are the only
luminous evolved stars for which it is possible to place a
time stamp: these stars are older than 11 Gyr (Walker
