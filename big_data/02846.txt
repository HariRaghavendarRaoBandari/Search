Stabiliser of an Attractive Fixed Point of
an IWIP Automorphism of a free product

Dionysios Syrigos

March 10, 2016

Abstract

For a group G of ﬁnite Kurosh rank and for some arbiratily
free product decomposition of G, G = H1 ∗ H2 ∗ ... ∗ Hr ∗ Fq,
where Fq is a ﬁnitely generated free group, we can associate
some (relative) outer space O(G, {H1, ..., Hr}). We deﬁne the
relative boundary ∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) = ∂(G, O) correspond-
ing to the free product decomposition, as the set of inﬁnite
reduced words (with respect to free product length). By de-
noting Out(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) the subgroup of Out(G) which is
consisted of the outer automorphisms which preserve the set
of conjugacy classes of Hi’s, we prove that for the stabiliser
Stab(X) of an attractive ﬁxed point in X ∈ ∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr})
of an irreducible with irreducible powers automorphism relative
to O, it holds that it has a (normal) subgroup B isomorphic to

subgroup of

Out(Hi) such that Stab(X)/B is isomorphic to

r

Z. The proof relies heavily on the machinery of the attractive
lamination of an IWIP automorphism relative to O.

Introduction

The outer automorphism group Out(Fn) of a ﬁnitely generated free
group Fn has been extensively studied.
In particular, Out(Fn) has
been studied via its action on the outer space CVn, which has been
introduced by Culler and Vogtmann in [6]. Let G be a group of ﬁnite
Kurosh rank, i.e. G can be written as a ﬁnite free product of the
form G = G1 ∗ G2 ∗ ... ∗ Gm ∗ Fn, where all the Gi’s are freely inde-
composable and Fn is a ﬁnitely generated free group. The concept of
the outer space can be generalised for such a group G and there is
a contractible space of G-trees, O(G, {G1, G2, ..., Gm}, Fn) on which
Out(G) acts. This space was introduced by Guirardel and Levitt in
[9]. In fact, for a group G as above and any non-trivial free product
decomposition G = H1 ∗ H2 ∗ ... ∗ Hr ∗ Fq (here Hi may be freely
decomposable or isomorphic to Z), they constructed a relative outer
O(G, {H1, H2, ..., Hr}, Fq) on which the subgroup Out(G, {H1, ..., Hr})
of Out(G) acts, where Out(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) = {Φ ∈ Out(G)| for every
i = 1, .., r, there is some j s.t. φ(Hi) = giHjg−1}.
For a ﬁnitely generated free group Fn, it is well known that we can
deﬁne the boundary ∂Fn which is a Cantor set and it can be viewed
as the set of inﬁnite reduced words (for some ﬁxed basis of Fn). More-
over, an automorphism φ ∈ Aut(Fn), can be seen as a quasi-isometry
of Fn and therefore it induces a homeomorphism of the boundary ∂Fn,
which we denote by ∂φ. As a consequence, we can study the subgroup
Stab(X) of automorphisms that ﬁx the inﬁnite word X ∈ ∂Fn, i.e.
φ ∈ Stab(X) iﬀ ∂φ(X) = X. In this paper, we would like to study the
corresponding notions for a group G (of ﬁnite Kurosh rank) relative to
some ﬁxed non-trivial free product decomposition and especially the
Aut(G, {H1, H2, ..., Hr})- stabiliser of inﬁnite reduced words. Firstly,
we ﬁx the outer space corresponding to some free product decomposi-
tion of G, as above. In this case, we can deﬁne a (relative) boundary
∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) as the set of inﬁnite reduced words for the free prod-
uct length (for some ﬁxed basis of the free group). Similarly, every
φ ∈ Aut(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) induces a homeomorphism ∂φ of the relative
boundary ∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr}). It is natural to ask if we can compute
the subgroups Stab(X) for any X ∈ ∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr}). However,
there is no full answer even in the free case. There are some partial
results and for example it is not diﬃcult to see that the stabiliser of

1 Introduction · 4

any point of the form u∞ = uuu... (where u is a hyperbolic cyclically
reduced element of G), is the subgroup of Aut(G, {H1, ..., Hr}), which
is consisted of the automorphisms that ﬁx u. There is also a result
of Hilion in this direction (see [11]). An automorphism of Aut(Fn) is
said IWIP (i.e. irreducible, with irreducible powers), if no non-trivial
free factor of Fn is mapped by some power k > 1 to a conjugate of
itself. Therefore, using this terminology, Hilion’s result can be stated
as:

Theorem. [Hilion] [11] If X ∈ ∂Fn is an attractive ﬁxed point of an
IWIP automorphism, then Stab(X) is inﬁnite cyclic.

In the general case, we say that an automorphism φ is IWIP rela-
tive to O, if there is non-trivial free factor B of G that strictly contain
some conjugate of some Hi, i = 1, ..., r, it is mapped by some power
φk, k > 1 to a conjugate of itself. Then the main result of the present
paper is a generalisation of the previous theorem.
However, here there is a diﬀerence that arises from the factor auto-
morphisms of the Hi’s. More precisely:

Main Theorem. If X ∈ ∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) is an attractive ﬁxed
point of an IWIP automorphism φ, then Stab(X) has a subgroup

B isomorphic to a subgroup of

cyclic.

L
i=1

Out(Hi) and Stab(X)/B is inﬁnite

In our case, there are examples of X, as above, where Stab(X) is
not inﬁnite cyclic. We describe such an example in the last section,
see 4.6. The main idea is that there are attractive ﬁxed words of IWIP
automorphisms that contain even ﬁnitely many elements of the elliptic
free factors. Moreover, if a factor automorphism (an automorphism of
some Hi) ﬁxes these words, then it stabilises the attractive ﬁxed point.
So if Hi’s are suﬃciently big, there are non-trivial automorphisms of
Hi that ﬁx these words. As a consequence, we can ﬁnd arbitrarily
large subgroups of Stab(X). On the other hand, if we suppose that
every Out(Hi) is ﬁnite, then we have a similar result as in the free
case. In particular:

Corollary 1.1. If X ∈ ∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) is an attractive ﬁxed point
of an IWIP automorphism φ and every Out(Hi) is ﬁnite, then Stab(X)
is virtually cyclic.

1 Introduction · 5

Our proof is similar to that of [11], but we have to adjust the no-
tions and to use the generalisations of the results used by Hilion, for
the general case of free products. In particular, we use the work of
Francaviglia and Martino [7] for train track representatives of IWIP
automorphisms of a free product instead of the classical notion of train
track representatives of automorphisms of free groups [2]. In fact, here
an IWIP automorphism relative to O can be represented by a train-
track map which is a G-equivariant, Lipschitz map f : T → T , where
T ∈ O and f (gx) = φ(g)f (x), with the property that no backtrack-
ing subpath occurs if one iterates the train-track map on any edge of
T . As a consequence of the general notion of train-track representa-
tives, the author in [19] generalised the work of Bestvina, Handel and
Mosher in the free case [1], and in particular we have the notion of
the attractive lamination of an IWIP automorphism.
Now let us describe the basic steps of the proof. Fistly, we construct a
nice splitting of a given attractive ﬁxed point X of an IWIP automor-
phism, using train track representatives, which matches the language
of the attractive lamination. Then we relate the subgroup Stab(X) to
the stabiliser of the attractive lamination, and so using the fact proved
in [19] about the stabiliser of the attractive lamination and a technical
lemma, and more speciﬁcally the fact that Stab(X) ∩ Out(G, {Hi}t)
is torsion free, we get the main result.
As we have seen, there are a lot of facts that they are shard by CVn
and the general space O. As we have already mentioned that the
train track representatives can be generalised in the general case. In
the same paper, there is the construction and the properties of the
Lipschitz metric for O which is a metric that the same authors pre-
viously studied for CVn (see [8]). Recently, there are more papers
that they indicate that we can ﬁnd more similarities between CVn
and O. For example, the construction of hyperbolic spaces on which
Out(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) acts ([10]), [13]), the boundary of outer space
([12]), the Tits alternative for subgroups of Out(G) ([14]), the study
of the asymmetry of the Lipschitz metric([20]) and the study of the
centralisers of IWIP automorphisms([19]).
OUTLINE: In Section 2, we recall some useful deﬁnitions and facts,
in additional we generalise some well known notions for free groups
to the free product case and we prove some basic preliminary results
that we need for the main theorem.
In Section 3, we describe the

2 Preliminaries · 6

construction of the attractive lamination for an IWIP automorphism
and we list some properties. The last section is devoted to the proof
of the main theorem.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 R -trees, Kurosh rank

Let G be a group of ﬁnite Kurosh rank i.e G splits as a free product
G = H1 ∗ ... ∗ Hs ∗ Fr, where every Hi is non-trivial, not isomorphic to
Z and freely indecomposable. Here the Kurosh rank of G is just the
number s + r. This decomposition is called the Gruskho decomposi-
tion. It is the ”minimal” decomposition of G and it is unique, in the
sense that the free rank r is well deﬁned and the Hi’s are unique up to
conjugation. The class of groups of ﬁnite Kurosh rank contain strictly
the class of ﬁnitely generated groups (by the Grushko theorem). We
are interested only for groups which have ﬁnite Kurosh rank.
In particular, for such a group G we ﬁx an arbitary (non-trivial) free
product decomposition G = H1 ∗ ... ∗ Hm ∗ Fn (i.e. we don’t assume
that every Hi is not inﬁnite cyclic or even freely indecomposable).
However, we usually assume that m + n > 2. These groups admit
co-compact actions on R-trees (and vice-versa). It is useful that we
can also apply the theory in the case that G is free, and the Hi’s are
certain free factors of G (relative free case).

We consider isometric actions of the group G on R-trees induced
by the free product decomposition and, more speciﬁcally, we say that
T is a G-tree, if it is a simplicial metric tree (T, dT ), where G acts
simplicially on T (sending vertices to vertices and edges to edges) and
for all g ∈ G, e ∈ E(T ) we have that e and ge are isometric. Moreover,
we suppose that every G-action is minimal, which means that there is
no G-invariant proper subtree.
Now let’s ﬁx a G-tree T . An element g ∈ G is called hyperbolic, if it
doesn’t ﬁx any points of T . Any hyperbolic element g of G acts by
translations on a subtree of T homeomorphic to the real line, which is
called the axis of g and is denoted by axisT (g). The translation length
of g is the distance that g translates its axis. The action of G on T

2.2 Relative Outer Space · 7

deﬁnes a length function denoted by

ℓT : G → R, ℓT (g) := inf
x∈T

dT (x, gx).

In this context, the inﬁmum is always minimum and we say that g ∈ G
is hyperbolic if and only if ℓT (g) > 0. Otherwise, g is called elliptic and
it ﬁxes a (unique) point of T . For more details about group actions
on R-trees, see [5].

2.2 Relative Outer Space

In this subsection we recall some basic deﬁnitions and properties.
More details about the relative outer space can be found in [7].
We consider G-trees as in the previous subsection. We will deﬁne an
outer space O = O(G, (Hi)m
i=1, Fn) relative to some ﬁxed free prod-
uct decomposition of G. More speciﬁcally, the elements of the outer
space can be thought as simplicial metric G-trees, up to G-equivariant
homothety. Moreover, we require that these G-trees also satisfy the
following conditions:

• The action of G on T is minimal.

• The edge stabilisers are trivial.

• There are ﬁnitely many orbits of vertices with non-trivial sta-
biliser, more precisely for every Hi, i = 1, ..., m (as above) there
is exactly one vertex vi with stabiliser Hi (all the vertices in the
orbits of vi’s are called non-free vertices).

• All other vertices have trivial stabiliser (and we call them free

vertices).

• The quotient G/T is a ﬁnite graph of groups

Note that the last condition follows from the others, but we mention
it in order to emphasise the importance of the co- compactness of the
action.

Action: Let Aut(G, O) be the subgroup of Aut(G) that preserve
the set of conjugacy classes of the Hi ’s. Equivalently, φ ∈ Aut(G)
belongs to Aut(G, O) iﬀ φ(Hi) is conjugate to one of the Hj ’s (in
general, i may be diﬀerent to j). The group Aut(G, O) admits a

2.3 Topological Representatives, O - Maps · 8

natural action on a simplicial tree by ”changing the action”, i.e. for
φ ∈ Aut(G, O) and T ∈ O, we deﬁne φ(T ) to be the metric tree with
T , but the action is given by g ∗ x = φ(g)x (where the action in the
right hand side is the action of the G-tree T ). As Inn(G) acts on O
trivially, Out(G, O) = Aut(G, O)/Inn(G) acts on O. Note also that in
the case of the Grushko decomposition, we have Out(G) = Out(G, O).

Remark. Note that for a g ∈ G and T, S ∈ O, it holds that g is
hyperbolic relative to T iﬀ g is hyperbolic relative to S. Therefore it
makes sense to say that g is hyperbolic relative to O, as we will do.
We denote by Hyp(O) the set of hyperbolic elements of O.

2.3 Topological Representatives, O - Maps

Edge paths: Firstly, we would like to deﬁne the notion of an edge
path for some tree T ∈ O. More speciﬁcally, since T is an R-tree we
have that any edge is isometric to the interval [0, ℓ(e)]. We say that an
edge path is a reduced path of the form e1e2...en (without backtrack-
ing). We can also deﬁne an inﬁnite edge path, as an inﬁnite reduced
path of the form e1e2...enen+1.... Similarly, we can deﬁne a bi-inﬁnite
edge path. We usually call paths lines these paths.
Tightening: Every path p is homotopic (relative endpoints) to a
unique edge path [p] in T . Actually, we can obtain from p the path
[p], after removing the backtracking, and we say that [p] is obtained
by tightening p.

O - maps:

Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a map between trees A, B ∈ O, f :
A → B is an O- map, if it is a G-equivariant, Lipschitz continuous,
surjective function.

It is very useful to know that there are such maps between any
two trees. This is true and, additionally, by their construction they
coincide on the non - free vertices. More speciﬁcally, by [7] we get:

Lemma 2.2. For every pair A, B ∈ O; there exists a O-map f : A →
B. Moreover, any two O-maps from A to B coincide on the non-free
vertices.

2.3 Topological Representatives, O - Maps · 9

Now we will prove that every O-map is a quasi-isometry. But

ﬁrstly, we need a technical lemma:

Lemma 2.3. Let T ∈ O and v be a vertex of T . Then the inclusion
map ι from the G-orbit of v, A = G · b to T is a quasi-isometry. As a
consequence, any projection p from T to A is again a quasi-isometry.

Proof. It is obvious that the inclusion map is 1 − 1 and satisﬁes that
dA(x, y) = dT (x, y). So it remains to show that ι is quasi- onto, which
means that there is some M s.t. for every x ∈ T there is some g ∈ G
with dT (x, gv) ≤ M. This follows from the fact that the quotient
Γ = G/T is compact and therefore we can choose M to be the maxi-
mum distance in Γ between the projection of v and the other vertices.
Therefore the result follows.

Lemma 2.4. Let T, S ∈ O and f : T → S be an O-map. Then f is
a quasi-isometry.

Proof. Let choose some vertex v ∈ T , then f induces a Lipschitz map
from A = Gv to B = Gf (v). Note also that by the construction of O-
maps there is an O - map h from S to T which is the inverse function
of f|A restricted to B and it is again Lipschitz. Therefore f|A is an
isomorphism between A and B (and in particular quasi-isometry).
Using now the lemma 2.3 and the fact that the inverse of a quasi-
q
isometry is a quasi-isometry we get that: T
−→ S, where
p is the projection of T to A and ι is the inclusion map, where the
maps p, q, f|A are quasi-isometries, and it follows that f is a quasi-
isometry.

f
−→ B

p
−→ A

Using the lemma 2.4 and the existence of O-maps between every

two elements of O (see 2.2), we get that:

Proposition 2.5. Let T, S ∈ O, then we have that the metric trees
T and S are quasi -isometric.

Topological representatives: It is very useful to see an outer

automorphism as a map between a tree T ∈ O. More speciﬁcally:

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) and T ∈ O, then we say that a
Lipschitz surjective map f : T → T represents Φ if for any g ∈ G
and t ∈ T we have f (gt) = Φ(g)(f (t)). In other words, f is an O-map
from T to Φ(T ).

2.4 N-periodic Paths · 10

Applying again 2.2 (the existence of O-maps), we get:

Lemma 2.7. Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) and T ∈ O. Then there is a (sim-
plicial) topological representative of Φ in T .

The topological representatives many times produce paths which
are not reduced, and then we have cancellation in their images. There-
fore we have to deﬁne a map (induced by f ) from the reduced edge-
paths of T to itself, and we denote it by f#, by the rule f#(w) = [f (w)]
for every edge-path w of T .

As these maps represent an outer automorphism Φ, if we change
the tree T with ιh(T ) where ιh ∈ Inn(G) is just the conjugation by
some h ∈ G, we get an other O-map that still represents Φ. There-
fore each regular automorphism φ ∈ Φ corresponds to some topo-
logical representative. In particular, for a topological representative
f : T → T of an automorphism Φ, and for every φ ∈ Φ, changing
appropriately the tree T with some ιh(T ), we can choose f to satisfy
φ(g)f = f g, for every g ∈ G. We say that f, φ are mated. Note that
in this case, for g ∈ G (as we can see g as an isometry of T ):

Remark. g ∈ F ix(φ) if and only g and f commute.

2.4 N-periodic Paths

Here we will deﬁne the notion of an N - path. See more about the
properties of N-periodic paths in [19]. A diﬀerence between the free
and our case is that it is not always true that there are ﬁnitely many
orbits of paths of a speciﬁc length (if there are non-free vertices with
inﬁnite stabiliser), but it is true that there are ﬁnitely many paths that
have diﬀerent projections in the quotient G/T . Therefore the notion
of an N- path (we deﬁne it below) plays the role of a Nielsen path.
Note that here if h : S → S, we say that a point x ∈ S is h-periodic,
if there are g ∈ G and some natural k s.t. hk(x) = gx.

Deﬁnition 2.8.

(i) Two paths p, q in S ∈ O are called equivalent, if
they project to the same path in the quotient G/S. In particular,
their endpoints o(p), o(q) and t(p), t(q) are in the same orbits,
respectively.

2.5 Relative Boundary · 11

(ii) Let h : S → S be a representative of some outer automorphism
Ψ, let p be a path in S and let’s suppose that the endpoints of p
and h(p) are in the same orbits (respectively), then we say that
a path p in S is N-path (relative to h), if the paths [h(p)], p are
equivalent.

In the free case, we need representatives of outer automorphisms
for which we can control the number of Nielsen paths. For example
the notion of stable and appropriate train track representatives. As
we will see, we can deﬁne the corresponding notions in our case but
using N-paths.

2.5 Relative Boundary

Let’s ﬁx some relative outer space O with respect to a some ﬁxed free
product decomposition of G. We will give the deﬁnition of the relative
boundary relative to O.
For every T ∈ O, we can use the Gromov hyperbolic boundary ∂T ,
as T is a 0-hyperbolic space (or a tree), by deﬁning it as the set of
equivalence classes of sequences of points in T that converge to inﬁnity
with respect to the Gromov product (with respect to some ﬁxed base
point p). However, it is more convenient for our purposes to deﬁne
it as the set of lines passing through a base point x ∈ T . The two
deﬁnitions coincide in the case of a proper (i.e. the closed balls are
compact) hyperbolic metric space. But in the case of trees, we don’t
need the properness. For more details about the Gromov Boundary,
see the very interesting survey for boundaries of hyperbolic spaces [15].
More speciﬁcally, for any two lines ℓ, ℓ′ starting from x ∈ T , we deﬁne
the equivalence relation by ℓ ≡ ℓ′ iﬀ ℓ, ℓ′ have an inﬁnite common
subline. Now we denote the boundary by ∂xT = {[ℓ]|ℓ : [0, ∞) → T
is a geodesic ray with ℓ(0) = x}. It is not diﬃcult to see that this
deﬁnition does not depend on the base point and so we will usually
omit the base point from the notation.
We can also deﬁne the r neighbourhood of a point r in the boundary,
as V (p, r) = {q ∈ ∂xT | for any geodesic rays ℓ1, ℓ2 starting at x and
with [ℓ1] = p, [ℓ2] = q we have lim inf
n→∞
Let p, q ∈ V (T ) ∪ ∂T , we deﬁne the operation ∧ as follows: p ∧ q is
the common initial subpath (starting from x) of the unique edge paths
[x, p], [x, q] that connect p, q with the base point x.

|ℓ1(t) ∧ ℓ2(t)| ≥ r}.

2.5 Relative Boundary · 12

We now topologise ∂T by setting the basis of neighborhoods for
any p ∈ ∂T to be the collection {V (p, r)|r ≥ 0}. Moreover, this
topology is metrisable and in particular, the metric on ∂T is given by
d(p, q) = e−|[x,p]∧[x,q]| for p, q ∈ ∂T (where e−∞ = 0).
It is not diﬃcult to see that any quasi-isometry f : T → S, induces
a homeomorphism between the boundaries ∂T, ∂S, as constructed. In
particular, since any O-map f : T → S is a quasi-isometry, it can
be extended to the boundary and it induces a well deﬁned homeo-
morphism, which we denote by ∂f : ∂T → ∂S. Therefore we get
that:

Lemma 2.9. Let T, S ∈ O. Then ∂T is homeomorpic to ∂S.

Note that in our case, if there is some inﬁnite Hi it is easy to
see that ∂T is not compact in the metric topology. For example, if we
have a point of inﬁnite valence we can produce a sequence of lines that
they have constant distance between each other. Therefore we have
a sequence in ∂T , which has not converging subsequence. However,
it is possible to ﬁnd other interesting topologies for which T ∪ ∂T is
compact. For example, see [4] for the observers’ topology.

We can also deﬁne the set ∂(G, O) of inﬁnite reduced words with
respect to the free product length which is induced by our ﬁxed free
product decomposition. For any A, B ∈ G ∪ ∂(G, O), we deﬁne the
operation ∧ as follows: A ∧ B is the longest common initial subword
of A, B. It is easy to see that the map d(A, B) = e−|A∧B|, for A 6= B
and d(A, A) = 0 is a metric on the space G ∪ ∂G. Finally, since any
φ ∈ Aut(G, O) can be seen as a quasi-isometry of G, we have that it
induces a homeomorphism of ∂(G, O) which we denote by ∂φ. Note
that the two notions of the boundary can be identiﬁed, in particular:

Lemma 2.10. Let T ∈ O. Then ∂T is homeomorphic to ∂(G, O).

Proof. Consider the universal cover S of the rose of m cycles with
n edges attached, corresponding to the free product decomposition
G = H1 ∗ ... ∗ Hm ∗ Fn with length of edges corresponding to the n
simple loops to be 1 and of the rest of edges to have length 1/2. It is
easy to see now that of an edge path starting from a base point v (it
can be chosen to be the lift of the unique free vertex of the quotient)
correspond to a word in G (and vice versa) and the length of the
edge path is exactly the free product length of the word. Moreover,

2.6 Rational and non-Rational Points · 13

the lines starting from the base point correspond to inﬁnite reduced
words of G with respect to the free product length. Therefore there is
a bijection from the set ∂S of lines of S starting from v to ∂(G, ∞).
Since the metrics are the similar, it is easy to see that this map is a
actually a homeomorphism. But now for every T ∈ O, we have that
∂T is homeomorphic to ∂S and the lemma follows.

Note also that since ∂T, ∂(G, O) are homeomorphic, we can iden-

tify ∂f and ∂φ.

2.6 Rational and non-Rational Points

For every hyperbolic element g of O, the sequence of elements gk have
arbitrarily large (free product) length and so it has a limit in the rela-
tive boundary ∂(G, O) , which we denote it by g∞. We can also deﬁne
g−∞ as (g−1)∞.
If g ∈ G, we denote by ιu the inner automorphism of G given by
ιu(g) = ugu−1, for every g ∈ G. If u ∈ Hyp(O) , it is easy to see that
then ∂ιu ﬁxes exactly two points of the relative boundary ∂(G, O) and
more speciﬁcally the points u∞, u−∞. Note that since edge stabilisers
of elements of O are trivial, for an elliptic element u then the inner
automorphism ιu cannot ﬁx a point of the boundary.
We say that inﬁnite words of the form u∞, u−∞ for a hyperbolic ele-
ment u, are rational points of the boundary. Alternatively, we could
deﬁne the rational points as the ﬁxed points of inner automorphisms
corresponding to hyperbolic elements.

Proposition 2.11. If X ∈ ∂(G, O) is not a rational point, then the
restriction of the quotient map Aut(G, O) → Out(G, O) to Stab(X)
is injective.

Proof. Let T ∈ O and let’s assume that φ ∈ Aut(G, O). Suppose also
that X is a ﬁxed point of ∂φ.
Let u be a non-trivial of O and suppose that X is ﬁxed by ∂(iu ◦ φ),
which implies that it is a ﬁxed point of ∂iu. As a consequence, u
is a hyperbolic element and in particular X it is rational point or
equivalently the axis of the hyperbolic element u, and so X = u∞ or
X = u−∞, which leads us to a contradiction.

2.7 Regular and Singular Fixed Points

For an automorphism φ ∈ Aut(G, O), we denote by F ixφ the ﬁxed
subgroup of φ: F ixφ = {g ∈ G|φ(g) = g}. Since by [3], we have that
F ixφ has ﬁnite Kurosh rank, its (relative) boundary ∂F ixφ embeds
into ∂(G, O) and it is actually a subgroup of F ix∂φ of ﬁxed inﬁnite
words by ∂φ. We will use the same terminology as in the free case and
we distinguish two cases for inﬁnite ﬁxed words of an automorphism
φ ∈ Aut(G, O) i.e. the elements of F ix∂φ : either it belongs to ∂F ixφ
and then it is called singular, or otherwise it is called regular.
For the singular ﬁxed points, the are two subcases. We use the notion
topologically attractive (and repulsive) ﬁxed points as in [16], but
there is also the a metric notion. These deﬁnitions are diﬀerent in
the free product case, while they coincide in the free case. For more
details, see [16].
We say that a ﬁxed point X of ∂φ attractive, if there is an integer
φn(Y ) = X. A ﬁxed point X is said
N s.t. if |Y ∧ X| ≥ N, then lim
n→∞
to be repulsive, if it is attractive for ∂φ−1. A classiﬁcation of ﬁxed
points of ∂φ has been proved in the proposition 5.1.14. of [16] and
more speciﬁcally:

Proposition 2.12. Let φ ∈ Aut(G, O). A ﬁxed point of ∂φ is :

• either singular

• or attractive

• or repulsive

2.8 Bounded Cancellation Lemma

Let T, T ∈ O and f : T → T ′ be an O- map.
If we have a con-
catenation of paths ab, ever if f (a) = f#(a) and f (b) = f#(b), it is
possible to have cancellation in f (a)f (b). However, the cancellation
is bounded above by some some M which depends only on f and not
on a, b . In particular, we can deﬁne the bounded cancellation con-
stant of f (let’s denote it BCC(f )) to be the supremum of all real
numbers N with the property that there exist A, B, C some points of
T with B in the (unique) reduced path between A and C such that
dT (f (B), [f (A), f (C)]) = N (the distance of f (B) from the reduced

2.9 Train Tracks · 15

path connecting f (A) and f (C) ), or equivalently is the lowest upper
bound of the cancellation for a ﬁxed O-map.
The existence of such number is well known, for example a bound has
given in [13]:

Lemma 2.13. Let T ∈ O, let T ∈ O, and let f : T → T ′ be a
Lipschitz map. Then BCC(f ) ≤ Lip(f )qvol(T ), where qvol(T ) the
quotient volume of T , deﬁned as the inﬁmal volume of a ﬁnite subtree
of T whose G-translates cover T .

Therefore we can deﬁne a new map, in particular:

Deﬁnition 2.14. Let f : T → T be a topological representative of
Φ ∈ Out(G, O) and let’s denote by C the bounded cancellation lemma
of f . Then for every edge path w of , we can deﬁne the map f#,C(w)
as the path obtained by removing both extremities of length C from
the reduced image of f#.

2.9 Train Tracks

In this section we will deﬁne the notion of a ”good” representative of
an outer automorphism Φ ∈ Out(G, O). As we have seen there are
representatives of every outer automorphism (i.e. O-maps from T to
φ(T )), but sometimes we can ﬁnd representatives with better prop-
erties.
In particular, we want a topological representative f , where
f k(e) = f k
#(e) for every k and for every edge e. These maps, which
are called train track maps, are very useful and every irreducible auto-
morphism has such a representative (we can choose it to be simplicial,
as well).
We give below a more general deﬁnition of a train track map represent-
ing an outer automorphism. We are interested for these maps because
we can control the cancellation (as we have seen, it is not possible to
avoid it). Firstly, we need the notions of a legal path relative to some
ﬁxed train track structure.

Deﬁnition 2.15.

(i) A pre-train track structure on a G-tree T
is a G-invariant equivalence relation on the set of germs of edges
at each vertex of T . Equivalence classes of germs are called
gates.

2.9 Train Tracks · 16

(ii) A train track structure on a G-tree T is a pre-train track

structure with at least two gates at every vertex.

(iii) A turn is a pair of germs of edges emanating from the same
vertex. A legal turn is called a turn for which the two germs
belong to diﬀerent equivalent classes. A legal path, is a path
that contains only legal turns.

Now we can deﬁne the train track maps.

Deﬁnition 2.16. An O-map f : T → T , which is representing Φ is
called a train track map, if there is a train track structure on T so
that

(i) f maps edges to legal paths (in particular, f does not collapse

edges).

(ii) If f (v) is a vertex, then f maps inequivalent germs at v to in-

equivalent germs at f (v).

However, we can not have such representatives for any outer auto-
morphism. But it can be proved that for an interesting class of outer
automorphisms can be represented by such a map. We will describe
this class for regular automorphisms, but it can easily be deﬁned for
outer automorphisms as well.
In the free case, an automorphism φ ∈ Aut(G, O) is called irreducible,
if it there is no φ-invariant free factor up to conjugation. In our case
we know that the Hi’s are invariant free factors, but we don’t want to
have ”more invariant free factors”. More precisely, we will deﬁne the
irreducibility of some automorphism relative to the space O or to the
free product decomposition. Similarly, we can deﬁne irreducibility for
outer automorphisms of G.

Firstly, we will give the algebraic deﬁnition, but we need the notion
of a free factor system. Suppose that G can be written as a free
product, G = G1 ∗ G2 ∗ ...Gk ∗ Fn. Then we say that the set A =
{[Gi] : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} is a free factor system for G, where [A] =
{gAg−1 : g ∈ G} is the set of conjugates of A.
Now we deﬁne an order which we denote by ⊒ on the set of free
factor systems of G. More speciﬁcally, given two free factor systems
G = {[Gi] : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} and H = {[Hj] : 1 ≤ j ≤ m}, we write G ⊑ H

2.9 Train Tracks · 17

if for each i there exists a j such that Gi ≤ gHjg−1 for some g ∈ G.
The inclusion is strict, and we write G ⊏ H, if some Gi is contained
strictly in some conjugate of Hj. We can see {[G]} as a free factor
system and in fact, it is the maximal (under ⊑) free factor system.
Any free factor system that is contained strictly to G is called proper.
Note also that the Grushko decomposition induces a free factor system,
which is actually the minimal free factor system (relative to ⊑).
We say that G = {[Gi]
: 1 ≤ i ≤ k} is φ - invariant for some
φ ∈ Aut(G), if φ preserves the conjugacy classes of Gi’s. In each free
factor system G = {[Gi] : 1 ≤ i ≤ p}, we associate the outer space
O = O(G, (Gi)p
i=1, Fk) and any φ ∈ Out(G) leaving G invariant, will
act on O in the same way as we have described earlier.

Deﬁnition 2.17. Let G be a free factor system of G which is Φ-
invariant for some Φ ∈ Out(G). Then Φ is called irreducible relative to
G, if G is a maximal (under ⊑) proper, Φ-invariant free factor system.

We could alternatively deﬁne the notion of irreducibility as:

Deﬁnition 2.18. We say φ ∈ Aut(G, O) is O-irreducible if for any
T ∈ O and choose some f : T → T representing Φ, where φ ∈ Φ and
f mated with φ, if W ⊆ T is a proper f -invariant G-subgraph then
W does not contain the axis of a hyperbolic element.

The next lemma conﬁrms that the two deﬁnitions of irreducibility

are related.

Lemma 2.19. Suppose G is a free factor system of G with associated
space of trees O, and further suppose that G is φ-invariant. Then φ is
irreducible relative to G if and only if φ is O-irreducible.

Now let’s give the deﬁnition of an irreducible automorphism with
irreducible powers relative to O, which are the automorphisms that
we will study.

Deﬁnition 2.20. An outer automorphism φ ∈ Out(G, O) is called
IWIP (irreducible with irreducible powers or fully irreducible), if every
φk is irreducible relative to O.

Now as we have said above, every irreducible outer automorphism
has a train track representative. This fact it generalises the well known
theorem of Bestvina and Handel (see [2]) . In particular, we can apply
it on every power of some IWIP automorphism.

2.9 Train Tracks · 18

Theorem 2.21 (Francaviglia- Martino). Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) be irre-
ducible. Then there exists a simplicial train track map representing
Φ.

An interesting remark is the following:

Remark. Every outer automorphism φ ∈ Aut(G) is irreducible rela-
tive to some appropriate space (or relative to some free product de-
composition). Moreover, there are two cases: either φ is IWIP relative
to O or it ﬁxes a point of O (i.e. there is T ∈ O s.t. φ can be seen as
an isometry of T ).

In particular, using the remark above, in the relative free case we
have some results for automorphisms of Out(Fn) that they are not
IWIP relative to CVn, but they are IWIP relative to some appropriate
space O.

Splittings and Appropriate train track maps:

In this section, we will deﬁne the notion of an appropriate train track
representative which is similar to the deﬁnition of the free case. As
we have discussed the notion of a Nielsen path in our case it has to
be replaced by the notion of a N-path. Using N-paths, we can deﬁne
the stable train track representatives.

Deﬁnition 2.22. We say that a train track representative f of an
outer automorphism Φ is stable, if it supports at most one equivalence
class of N-paths.

It is well known that every outer automorphism can be represented
by a stable train track representative (for example see [3] or [18]). Let’s
denote by p some representative of the unique class of the N-path that
f supports, if it exists. Here we need some even better notion of train
track representatives, but ﬁrstly we need the notion of a splitting.
More speciﬁcally, let f as above, and let w be a path in T . We say
that w = ...wmwm+1..., where wi’s are non-trivial subpaths of w, is a
splitting for f if for all k ≥ 1, f k
#(wm+1)..... Then
we use the notation: w = ... · wm · wm+1 · ... and the wi’s are called the
bricks of w.

#(w) = ...f k

#(wm)f k

Deﬁnition 2.23. A stable train track representative f : T → T of
an IWIP outer automorphism Φ ∈ Out(G, O) is called appropriate, if

3 The Attractive lamination of an IWIP Automorphism ·
19

for any path w of T , there exists some positive integer K s.t. for all
k ≥ K, f k
#(w) has a splitting where the bricks are either edger or they
are N-paths equivalent to p.

The proof of the next lemma is the same as in the free case, but
the main diﬀerence is that we don’t have ﬁnitely many paths of a
given length but ﬁnitely many inequivalent paths of a given length.
Therefore in the conclusion we have N-paths (and no Nielsen paths).

Lemma 2.24. Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) be an IWIP automorphism. Then
there exists some positive power of Φ, which can be represented by an
appropriate train track representative.

3 The Attractive lamination of an IWIP Auto-

morphism

In this section we recall the notion of an algebraic lamination.
In
particular, we describe the construction and the properties of the at-
tractive lamination of an IWIP automorphism which have been proved
by the author in [19]. Note that this construction is a direct generali-
sation of the corresponding well known notion due to Bestvina, Feighn
and Handel in the free case, see [1].

3.1 Laminations

We denote by ∂2(G, O) the pairs of the boundary which don’t belong in
the diagonal, i.e. the set {(X, Y )|X, Y ∈ ∂(G, O), X 6= Y }. Note that
the topology of ∂(G, O) induces a topology on ∂2(G, O). Moreover,
we have a natural action of G on ∂(G, O) which induces a diagonal
action on ∂2(G, O).

Deﬁnition 3.1. An algebraic lamination L of G is a subset of
∂2(G, O), which is closed, G-invariant and ﬂip invariant (i.e. if (X, Y ) ∈
∂2(G, O), then (Y, X) ∈ ∂2(G, O)).

The identiﬁcation of ∂(G, O) with ∂T where T ∈ O, implies that
the lamination L induces a set of lines L(T ) in T , which we call the
symbolic lamination in T -coordinates associated to L. A line of the
lamination is called leaf. Now we can deﬁne the laminary language
L(L(T )) in T -coordinates as the G-set of all (orbits of) ﬁnite edge
paths which occur in some leaf of L(T ).

3.2 Action of Out(G, O) on the set of Laminations · 20

3.2 Action of Out(G, O) on the set of Laminations

Now we can deﬁne an action of Out(G, O) on the set of algebraic lam-
for φ ∈ Aut(G, O), (X, Y ) ∈ ∂2(G, O) we
inations of G, as follows:
deﬁne the map ∂2φ by ∂2φ(X, Y ) = (∂φ(X), ∂φ(Y )) which is a well
deﬁned homeomorphism of ∂2(G, O) (since ∂φ is a homeomorphism).
This implies that this map sends an algebraic lamination to an alge-
braic lamination. Note that from the G-invariance of the lamination
follows that the image of this map depends only of the outer auto-
morphism Φ, where φ ∈ Φ. As a consequence we have a well deﬁned
action of the group of outer automorphisms Out(G, O) on the set of
algebraic laminations .

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) and L be an algebraic lamination.
Moreover, assume f : T → T for some T ∈ O is a topological repre-
sentative of Φ and let denote by C the bounded cancellation constant
corresponding to f .

• We say that Φ stabilises the algebraic lamination L,

if

Φ(L) = L.

• We say that f stabilises the laminary language L(L(T )), if

for all w ∈ L(L(T )), f#,C(w) ∈ L(L(T )).

Actually, these deﬁnitions are closely related. More speciﬁcally, by

[19] we have:

Proposition 3.3. Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) be an IWIP outer automor-
phism and L+
Φ iﬀ
there is some representative h : T → T of Ψ, where T ∈ O, which
stabilises the laminary language L(L+

Φ be its attractive lamination. Then Ψ stabilises L+

Φ) of Φ.

3.3 The Attractive Lamination of an IWIP Outer Automor-

phism

Here we describe the construction of the attractive lamination relative
to an IWIP outer automorphism Φ ∈ Out(G, O) and we list some
interesting properties.
Firstly, we recall the notion of a quasi-periodic line ℓ of T ∈ O.

3.3 The Attractive Lamination of an IWIP Outer
Automorphism · 21

Deﬁnition 3.4. A line ℓ of T is called quasi-periodic (or q.p.) if
for every L > 0 there exists some L′ (suﬃciently large) s.t. for every
subpath of length L of ℓ occurs as subpath of some orbit of every
subpath of ℓ of length L′.

Note that the notion of quasi-periodicity for ℓ implies that (the
orbits of) every path of ℓ occurs inﬁnite many times in both ends of ℓ
and moreover the distance between any two occurrences is bounded.
Now for an IWIP automorphism Φ, let’s choose some train track rep-
resentative f : T → T of Φ. We can deﬁne the laminary language of
our attractive lamination as the G- set L+
f of the orbits of ﬁnite edge
paths in T s.t. an edge path w ∈ L+
f iﬀ there exists an edge e of T
and an integer k ≥ 1 s.t. w is a subpath of f k(e).
It can be proved that we have the following properties:

Proposition 3.5. [19]

(i) For any edge e of T and for all w ∈ L+

f , there is some k such

that w is a subpath of some orbit of f k(e).

(ii) There exists an algebraic lamination L+

Φ whose laminary lan-

guage in T -coordinates is L+
f .

(iii) This algebraic lamination does not depend on the choice of the

train track map f representing Φ and of the tree T .

(iv) Every leaf of the L+

Φ is quasiperiodic.

Moreover, we have a very interesting result about the stabiliser of

the lamination which has been proved by the author in [19]:

Theorem 3.6. Let’s denote by Stab(L+
Φ) the stabiliser of the lami-
nation. Then there is a normal periodic subgroup A of Stab(L+
Φ) ∩
Out(G, {Hi}t), such that the group Stab(Λ)/A has a normal subgroup

4 Attractive Fixed points of an IWIP automor-

phism

In this section, we will prove the main theorem of this paper. Our
result and the method is a direct generalisation of the main result of
[11].

4.1 Structure of an Attractive Fixed point of an IWIP Au-

tomorphism

Proposition 4.1. Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) be an IWIP automorphism
which can be represented by an appropriate train-track map f : T →
T . Let φ ∈ Φ, and suppose that f is mated with φ. Let’s denote by
X ∈ ∂(G, O) an attractive ﬁxed point of φ. Then there is some vertex
v ∈ T such that:

(i) [v, f 2(v)] = [v, f (v)] · [f (v), f 2(v)]

(ii) if we denote by Rv = [v, f (v)] · [f (v), f 2(v)] · . . . · [f k(v), f k+1(v)] ·

. . ., we have that Rv represents the point X

(iii) the segment [v, f (v)] has a splitting whose bricks are either an
edge or belongs to the unique equivalence class of the N- path p
of T (if it exists) and, in addition, the ﬁrst brick of this splitting
is an edge.

Proof. Firstly, we will prove that we can ﬁnd a point v0 ∈ T which
satisﬁes the properties (i) and (ii).
By the deﬁnition of an attractive ﬁxed point of ∂φ and since f : T → T
is a train track map, there exists a vertex v0 of T s.t. the limit of it-
erates f k(v0) converges to X.
We denote by Rv0 the line that is constructed as in item (ii), cor-
responding to v0, and by our assumption we get that Rv0 represents
X. For every k we can deﬁne inductively the points vk, obtaining
vk+1 ∈ Rv0 as the projection of the reduced image of f (vk) in Rv0.
Then it is clear to see that by construction that:

[vk+1, vk+2] ⊆ [f (vk), f (vk+1)] = f#([vk, v + k + 1]) ⊆ f ([vk, vk+1])

For every k = 0, 1, 2, ..., we deﬁne the set Vk = {x ∈ T |f i(v) ∈
[vi, vi+1], for every 0 ≤ i ≤ k}, and since for y ∈ Vk we get that

4.1 Structure of an Attractive Fixed point of an IWIP
Automorphism · 23

f k(y) ∈ [vk, vk+1], we have that f k(Vk) ⊆ [vk, vk+1]. We will prove
that this is actually an equality, i.e. f k(Vk) = [vk, vk+1] .
We will prove it by induction on n = k:
For k = 0, it is obvious since V0 = [v0, v1] = f 0([v0, v1]) = f 0(V0).
Suppose now that our induction hypothesis is true for n = k, i.e.
f k(Vk) = [vk, vk+1] and we will prove it for n = k + 1.
Since [vk+1, vk+2] ⊆ f ([vk, vk+1]), by the induction hypothesis we get
that [vk+1, vk+2] ⊆ f (f k(Vk)) = f k+1(Vk).
Now by deﬁnition of Vk, we have that:

x ∈ Vk+1 ⇐⇒ x ∈ Vk and f k+1(x) ∈ [vk+1, vk+2]

But for some y ∈ [vk+1, vk+2], as have seen, there is some x ∈ Vk s.t.
f k+1(x) = y ∈ [vk+1, vk+2]. Using the equivalence above, we get that
x ∈ Vk+1 and so y ∈ f k+1(Vk+1) and our claim has been proved.
Then the equality f k(Vk) = [vk, vk+1], implies that every Vk is non-
empty for every k. Since the Vk’s form a decreasing sequence of non-
empty closed subsets of [v0, v1] (thus compact), which implies that
the intersection of all Vk’s is non-empty. In particular, there is some
point v ∈ Vk for every k. By the construction of Vk, we get that
f k(v) ∈ [vk, vk+1] for every k and so v satisﬁes the properties (i) and
(ii).
Now we would like to prove that we can choose v to be a vertex which
additionally satisﬁes (iii). Let’s suppose that v is not a vertex. Then
after passing to some power, we can choose an appropriate train track
representative, and then the path u = [v0, f 2(v0)] has a splitting for
which the corresponding bricks are either edges or lifts of the unique
(up to equivalence) N-path of f (if it exists). Then we consider the
initial vertex v′ of the brick of u that contains f (v0). By choice of v′, we
#(u) = [f k(v0), f k+2(v0)] for every k. Moreover,
have that f k
as v′ ∈ [v, f (v)], we get that f k(v′) ∈ [f k(v), f k+1(v)]. Therefore
f k(v′) ∈ Rv0 for all k. Therefore v′ can be chosen to be a vertex.
Finally, since X is an attractive ﬁxed point of ∂φ, we have that the
distance between f k(v′) and f k+1(v′) is going to inﬁnity, as k is going
to inﬁnity. In particular, there is a brick b of [v′, f (v′)] s.t. the length
of the reduced image of f k(b) is going to inﬁnity, which implies that b
must be an edge (since the lengths of f k
#(p) are bounded). Changing
v′ by the initial vertex of b, we ﬁnd a point that satisﬁes (i),(i), and
(iii).

#(v′) ∈ f k

4.2 The Stabiliser of an Attractive Fixed point of an
IWIP Automorphism · 24

Now assuming the splitting of [v, f (v)] = b0 · b1 · . . . · bq, as in
the previous proposition, we can group together the successive bricks
which are N-paths and they are equivalent with p ( we call this new
splitting, the adapted splitting). Therefore we can assume that b0 is
a single edge and every other bi is either a single edge (and then we
say that bi is a regular brick) or it is equivalent to a power of p (and
then we say that bi is singular).
Note that, by construction, between 2 singular bricks there is at least
one regular brick. Moreover, the adapted splitting of [v, f (v)] induces
a splitting of [f k(v), f k+1(v)] = b0,k · b1,k · . . . · bq,k for every k, where
bi,k = f k
#(bi). Similarly, we extend the notions of regularity and sin-
gularity, using the corresponding notions as in the adapted splitting
of [v, f (v)].
Finally, note that by construction and since every [f k(v), f k+1(v)]
starts with a regular brick, we have that the adapted splitting of Rv
still satisﬁes the property: between 2 singular bricks there is at least
one regular brick. Note also that the lengths of the singular bricks of
Rv are bounded uniformly (for instance this follows by the quasiperi-
ocity of the any leaf of the lamination).

4.2 The Stabiliser of an Attractive Fixed point of an IWIP

Automorphism

Theorem 4.2. If X ∈ ∂(G, O) is an attractive ﬁxed point of an IWIP
automorphism φ ∈ Aut(G, O). Assume that ψ ∈ Aut(G, O) ﬁxes X,
then if we denote by Φ, Ψ the outer automorphisms corresponding to
φ, ψ respectively, it is true that Ψ stabilises the attractive lamination
L+
Φ.

Φ = L+

Φk for every positive integer k.

Proof. Firstly, we note that since X is an attractive ﬁxed point of φ,
then X is an attractive ﬁxed point of φk for every k ≥ 0. Moreover, by
the construction of the (attractive) lamination (see [19]) we get again
that L+
Therefore, after possibly changing Φ with Φk, we can assume that Φ
is represented (by applying 2.24) by an appropriate train track repre-
sentative f : T → T . Here we ﬁx our notation, more speciﬁcally let
h : T → T be the O-map which represents Ψ and let denote by C the
bounded cancellation constant (2.13) corresponding to h. Finally, we
denote by ℓ0 the maximal length of a singular brick in Rv, using the

4.2 The Stabiliser of an Attractive Fixed point of an
IWIP Automorphism · 25

notation of the proposition 4.1.
Now let u be an edge path of the laminary language of the symbolic
attractive lamination. We need to prove that there is an occurrence
(orbit) of the reduced image (after deleting some extremal paths of
length C), h#,C(u) in Rv which is completely contained in a regular
brick of the adapted splitting. This implies that h#,C(u) is contained
in L(L(T )) and then by applying 3.3, the theorem follows.
Now since every leaf of the lamination is quasiperiodic (see 3.5 for
the properties of the lamination), we can ﬁnd an edge path U in the
laminary language corresponding to T , which has the type U = uu0u
(where by u we mean that they are of the same orbit) and u0 can be
chosen arbitrarily long.
It is convenient for us to assume that the length of h#(u0) is longer
than the number ℓ + 2C. This can be done since every O - map,
and in particular h, is a quasi-isometry. (Indeed if h is a (µ, ν) quasi-
isometry, it is enough to consider the starting path u0 to be longer
than µ(ℓ + 2C + ν)).
Using again the quasiperiodicity and the fact that the regular bricks
have unbounded lengths, we have that there is some K, s.t. eventually
for every k ≥ K, we can ﬁnd an occurrence of U in every regular brick
bi,k. In particular, we can ﬁnd inﬁnitely many occurrences of U in Rv
and so, by the deﬁnition of the action of an automorphism on the set
of laminations, inﬁnitely many occurrences of h#,C(U) in h#(Rv).
In order to prove it, ﬁrstly we note that since ψ(X) = X and so
h#(Rv) ∩ Rv is a subray of Rv, there are inﬁnitely many occurrences
of h#,C(U) in Rv. Let’s denote by wj a sequence of these distinct
occurrences.
As we have seen above, the regular bricks of Rv become arbitrarily
long after some steps and therefore for every path ﬁxed path m there
is a ﬁnite number of occurrences of m that fully contain a regular
brick.
If there is some wi that is fully contained in a regular brick, then
there is some occurrence of h#,C(u) ⊆ h#(U) which is fully contained
in this brick and our claim has been proved. Otherwise, using the
remark above, after passing to a subsequence, we can see that every
wj meet at most two regular and a singular bricks of Rv. In particular,
we can suppose that are three possibly cases and we will prove that
our claim is always true:

4.2 The Stabiliser of an Attractive Fixed point of an
IWIP Automorphism · 26

(i) All wj’s meet two regular bricks and one singular brick which is

joining the regular ones.
In this case, h#,C(U) = u1 · b · u2, where each ui is contained in
some regular brick. By the choice of ℓ0, we can suppose that at
least one of ui’s satisﬁes the inequality:

|ui| ≥

|h#,C(U)| − ℓ0

2

.

Moreover, since by the deﬁnition of the map h#,C and using the
bounded cancellation lemma, since U = uu0u we have that:

|h#,C(U)| ≥ 2 · |h#,C(u)| + |h#,C(u0)|.

Combining these inequalities with the choice of u0, we have that
|ui| ≥ |h#,C(u)|, which means that h#,C(u) is a subpath of ui
and so it is fully contained in a regular brick.

(ii) All wj’s meet two consecutive regular bricks.

In thiss case, as above, h#,C(U) = u1 · u2, where both ui’s are
contained in some regular bricks. As previously, there is some
ui s.t.:

|ui| ≥

|h#,C(U)|

2

≥

2 · |h#,C(u)| + |h#,C(u)|

2

≥ |h#,C(u)|

Therefore we have the same conclusion: that h#,C(u) is con-
tained in some ui and therefore in some regular brick.

(iii) All wj’s meet two consecutive bricks: a regular and a singular

one.
In this case, without loss, we assume that h#,C(U) = u1·b, where
u1 is contained in a regular brick and b′ in a singular brick. Then
by the choice of ℓ0, we get that:

|u1| ≥ |h#,C(U)| − ℓ0 ≥ |h#,C(u)|

As in the previous cases, we get that h#,C(u) is a subpath of a
regular brick.

4.2 The Stabiliser of an Attractive Fixed point of an
IWIP Automorphism · 27

Proposition 4.3. Let φ ∈ Aut(G, O) be an IWIP automorphism.
If X is an attractive ﬁxed point of φ, and ψ ∈ Aut(G, {Hi}t) with
ψ(X) = X and ψ has ﬁnite order, then ψ is the identity.

Proof. Firstly, note that since ψ has ﬁnite order, as in the free case
we have that any ﬁxed point of ∂ψ is singular, i.e. X ∈ ∂F ix(ψ).
From the Kurosh subgroup theorem we have that F ix(ψ) = A1 ∗ ... ∗
Aq ∗ F , where each Hi is contained in some conjugate of some Gj and
F is a free group. Since ψ ∈ Aut(G, {Hi}t), it’s easy to see that every
Ai is exactly a conjugate of the corresponding Hj.
Combining the facts that the Kurosh rank of a the ﬁxed subgroup is
less than the Kurosh rank of G and the Schreier formula for Kurosh
ranks (see [3] and [17]) if ψ is not the identity, then F ix(ψ) is not of
ﬁnite index and therefore applying the Proposition 6.2 of [19], does
not carry the lamination. In other words, if we consider some (opti-
mal) topological representative h : T → T of ψ and we denote by T ′
the subtree of T corresponding to F ix(ψ), we have that X is ﬁxed by
ψ iﬀ some line representing X is contained in T ′. As we have seen, it
is not possible for T ′ to contain some leaf ℓ of L+

Φ(T ).

So there is a ﬁnite subpath of some ℓ ∈ L+

Φ(T ) which cannot be
lifted in T ′. Using the notation of the previous propositions, we denote
by Rv to be the line that represents X. By the deﬁnition of the
lamination, w appears in all suﬃciently long regular bricks of Rv and
in particular inﬁnitely many times in Rv. Also, it appears inﬁnitely
many times in any ray R in T representing X. As a consequence, no
ray representing X can be lifted to T ′. Therefore X cannot be ﬁxed
by ∂ψ, with only exception the case where ψ is the identity.

Now Theorem 1 is just a corollary of the previous statements. In

particular,

Corollary 4.4. Let Φ ∈ Out(G, O) be an IWIP outer automorphism.
If X ∈ ∂(G, O) is an attractive ﬁxed point of an IWIP automorphism
φ ∈ Φ, then Stab(X) injects into Stab(L+
Φ) via the quotient map
Aut(G, O) → Out(G, O). Moreover, there is a normal subgroup B of

Stab(X) isomorphic to a subgroup of

isomorphic to Z.

4.2 The Stabiliser of an Attractive Fixed point of an
IWIP Automorphism · 28

Proof. Since φ is an IWIP, and in particular it is not an inner au-
tomorphism, we have that X is not a rational point, and therefore
we can apply the proposition 2.11 and the theorem 4.2, we get that
Stab(X) can be seen as a subgroup of Stab(Λ+
Φ). Using the basic
result of [19] (Theorem 3.6), we get that there is a normal peri-
odic subgroup A′ of Stab(X), such that the group Stab(X)/A′ has

a normal subgroup B′ isomorphic to a subgroup of

Out(Hi) and

p
L
i=1

(Stab(X)/A)/B is isomorphic to Z. But then by applying 4.3, we get
that Stab(X) ∩ Out(G, {Hi}t) is torsion free, therefore A′ (which is
a subgroup of Stab(X) ∩ Out(G, {Hi}t) so torsion free and periodic)
is the trivial group and we can conclude that there is a normal sub-

group B of Stab(X) isomorphic to a subgroup of

Stab(X)/B is isomorphic to Z.

An obvious corollary is the following:

Corollary 4.5. If X ∈ ∂(G, {H1, ..., Hr}) is an attractive ﬁxed point
of an IWIP automorphism φ and suppose that every Out(Hi) is ﬁnite,
then Stab(X) is virtually inﬁnite cyclic.

Example of an automorphism φ and an attractive ﬁxed point of X

of φ , such that Stab(X) is not cyclic.

Example 4.6. Let’s suppose that our free product decomposition is of
the form G = G1∗ < b1 > ∗ < b2 > , where bi are of inﬁnite order.
Here G1 is an elliptic subgroup, we denote by F2 =< b1 > ∗ < b2 >
the ”free part” and by O the corresponding outer space O(G, G1, F2).
Then we deﬁne the automorphism φ, which satisﬁes φ(a) = a for every
a ∈ G1, φ(b1) = b2g1, φ(b2) = b1b2 where g1 ∈ G1, and it is easy to see
that φ ∈ Aut(G, O) is an IWIP automorphism relative to O. Actually,
the automorphism induces a train track representative. Since Aut(G1)
can be seen as a subgroup of Aut(G, O), it follows that there is an
attractive ﬁxed point X of φ which contains just the letters b1, b2, g1 of
φ and we have that for every ψ ∈ Aut(G1) ﬁxes g1, i.e. ψ(g1) = g1,
we have that ψ(X) = X. Therefore Stab(X) contains the subgroup A
of Aut(G1) of automorphisms of G1 that ﬁx g1. Therefore since we
can choose G1 with arbitarily big Aut(G1) and in particular A to not
be inﬁnite cyclic, Stab(X) isn’t always inﬁnite cyclic. For example, if

G1 is isomorphic to F3 and g1 an element of its free basis, we have
that Stab(X) contains a subgroup which is isomorphic to Aut(F2).
