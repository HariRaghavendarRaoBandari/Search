We discuss the inﬂuence of a rapid thermal annealing step on the magneto-optical emission prop-
erties of In(Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots. We map out a strong inﬂuence of the growth- and anneling
parameters on the quantum excitons’ eﬀective Land´e g-factors and in particular on their diamagnetic
coeﬃcients, which we directly correlate with the modiﬁcation of the emitters shape and material
composition. In addition, we study the excitons’ spontaneous emission lifetime as a function of the
annealing temperature and the dot height, and observe a strong increase of the emission rate with
the quantum dot volume. The corresponding increase in oscillator strenth yields fully consistent
results with the analysis of the diamagenic behavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a rapid
thermal annealing step of 850◦ C can be employed to increase the oscillator strength of as-grown
InAs/GaAs QDs by more than a factor of 2.

INTRODUCTION

ter interaction (light matter coupling constant g ∝ √

Tremendous progress has been achieved the last years
in understanding and exploiting the electronic as well as
the photonic characteristics of semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs), resulting in remarkable achievements such
as the observation of triggered single photon emission1–3,
generation of highly indistinguishable4,5 and entangled6
photon pairs as well as reaching the strong coupling
regime of a single solid state quantum emitter and the
localized ﬁeld of a cavity mode7–9. The QD’s oscillator
strength (OS) is a dimensionless parameter describing
the strength of the coupling of a transition from an ex-
cited to the ground state of a quantum emitter to the
surrounding light ﬁeld and is therefore a crucial factor
in any kind of cavity quantumelectrodynamics (cQED)
experiment. A larger OS leads to a stronger light mat-
f )
which is, e.g. crucial to reach the strong coupling regime
where a coherent exchange of light and matter is pos-
sible.
In the limit of weak conﬁnement of an exciton
in a QD, the OS is associated to the QD’s size. Thus,
morphologically large QDs in the III/V semiconductor
system such as low strain InGaAs QDs (f up to 50)7
and natural GaAs islands (f ≈ 100)9 have been identi-
ﬁed to particularly promote strong coupling conditions.
As these QDs evolve just at the layer-to-island transi-
tion of the Stranski-Kranstanov growth mode, or form
as natural islands driven by surface migration, routinely
reproducing and engineering QDs with a high OS is very
diﬃcult.
Several groups have shown that rapid thermal annealing
(RTA) of InAs QDs is a useful technique to take inﬂuence
on the emission properties after the growing process. For
example, RTA allows for tailoring the QD size, the in-
dium composition and with that the emission energy as
well as the linewidth of the quantum dot ensemble10–14.
Furthermore it is possible to adjust the dephasing time of

QD excitons15. Recently, it also has been indicated that
post growth, rapid thermal annealing of InAs QDs can
also be exploited to signiﬁcantly enhance the oscillator
strength of QDs16. While these results are very promis-
ing, a thorough investigation of the eﬀect of rapid thermal
annealing on the intrinsic excitonic properties is still elu-
sive. Here, in a systematic analysis we demonstrate the
inﬂuence of a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process on
the QD properties via magnetic ﬁeld dependent micro-
photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved spectroscopy.
We show an increase of the mean lateral expansion of
the exciton wavefunction in InAs/GaAs QDs by about
70% and more than a doubling of the OS under appro-
priate growth and annealing conditions. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that measuring the diamagnetic response of
a QD exciton is a viable tool to directly assess the emit-
ter’s oscillator strength as it yields reliable and consistent
results on the single emitter scale.

II. THEORY

To describe a QD in a magnetic ﬁeld on a basic level,
we consider the exciton energy E0 without magnetic ﬁeld,
the Zeeman interaction between electrons and holes and
the diamagnetic shift energy which is induced by the ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld. The total energy of the system in a
magnetic ﬁeld in Faraday conﬁguration (B = (0, 0, Bz))
is then given by:

The dimensionless oscillator strength f describes the
coupling strength between the light ﬁeld and the transi-
tion from an excited to the ground state of the emitter.
It indicates the absorption and recombination probabil-
ity in bulk material and depends primarily on the overlap
of the wave functions of the electron and the hole. f can
be correlated with the radiative decay rate Γ(ω) via18:

III. SAMPLE DESIGN AND EXPERIMENTAL

METHODS

A. Sample preparation

The QDs under consideration were grown via molecu-
lar beam epitaxy (MBE) and treated by the partial cap-
ping and annealing (PCA) technique. The InAs-QDs de-
posited on a GaAs buﬀer layer were overgrown by a GaAs
cap layer and were then in-situ annealed for one minute
at a nominal substrate temperature of 560◦ C. The PCA
process leads to an enhanced interdifusion of the Ga- and
In-atoms and ﬂushes away the uncovered QD tip21. The
QD height and hence the emission energy hereby strongly
depend on the cap thickness. After the in-situ anneal-
ing process the crystal growth was completed by a 100
nm thick GaAs cap to circumvent nonradiative surface
recombination. The emission frequency of the QDs can
additionally be tuned by an ex-site rapid thermal anneal-
ing (RTA) step. Thereby the samples were heated up to
temperatures in the range of 750◦ C to 850◦ C for 5 min-
utes. Thus the interdiﬀusion process is boosted again
and the further mixing of the atoms leads to an increase
in the QD volume. In addition a blue shift of the emis-
sion takes place due to the reduction of the In content
in the QD11,12,14. For a detailed analysis of the inﬂuence

of the annealing process on the OS we have grown three
samples with a varying cap thickness d from 2 nm to
4 nm. Each specimen was cleaved into four pieces, and
three of these pieces were treated via RTA at 750◦ C,
800◦ C and 850◦ C. For the fourth piece, the annealing
step was omitted and the sample served as a reference.
Fig. 1 shows a scanning electron microscope (SEM) im-
age of the surface QDs prior to the capping (a) and a
scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) im-
age of a QD after the growth of the full structure has
been accomplished (b). The thickness of the partial cap
was chosen to d = 3 nm in this particular sample. While
the surface QDs exhibit the typical pyramidal shape, the
top side of the overgrown QD is signiﬁcantly ﬂattened
and QD height decreased down to the thickness of the
capping layer.

B. Experimental methods

Magneto-optical studies were performed at a temper-
ature of 5 K using a high resolution PL setup. The mag-
net cryostat provides magnetic ﬂux densities up to 5 T in
Faraday conﬁguration. The samples were excited with a
Ti:Sapphire laser tuned to 780 nm which can be operated
in cw- as well as in pulsed-mode with a repetition rate of
82 MHz. The emitted photons were collected by a 50x
microscope objective (N A = 0.42), dispersed by a grat-
ing with 1200 lines/mm and detected with a LN2 cooled
Si-CCD. The magneto-optical measurements were per-
formed in cw-mode. To investigate the Zeeman-splitting,
a quarter wave plate was mounted in addition to a linear
polarizer. Adjusting the quarter wave plate accurately in
an angle of ±45◦ with respect to linear polarizer we can
extract the circular polarized part of the QD emission.
The samples were also investigated under pulsed excita-
tion in order to measure the lifetime of the QDs. The
emission signal of the quantum dot ensemble was ﬁl-

tered by the monochromator and then focused on a ﬁber-
coupled avalanche photo diode (APD) with a temporal
resolution of ∼ 40 ps.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Figure 2 shows a typical emission spectrum of a QD
at diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds. The investigated sample was
the reference sample with a cap thickness of 3 nm. The
intensity was normalized for each spectrum. Since the
typical QD ﬁne structure splitting (FSS) is on the order
of 10 µeV for these QDs and the resolution of our setup is
about 35 µeV no notable splitting was detected (without
performing more sophisticated measurements). However,
one clearly sees the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld (cf.
equation 1) on the QD emission energy. The Zeeman
splitting between the right (σ+)- and left (σ−)-circular
polarized photons increases linearly with the magnetic
ﬁeld and the diamagnetic shift superimposes the split
doubled.

A. Zeeman splitting and Land´e g-factor

In order to study the evolution of the Zeeman splitting
and the eﬀective Land´e g-factors of the QDs in greater
detail, we plot the energetic gap between the σ+ and the
σ− emission, which is deﬁned as EZeeman = E(σ+) −
E(σ−), as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld. The result for
each sample is depicted in ﬁg. 3 a)-c). Up to 9 diﬀerent

FIG. 3: Zeeman splitting versus the magnetic ﬁeld for cap
thicknesses d of 2 nm a), 3 nm b) and 4 nm c) as well as
the determined eﬀective g-factors in dependence of the ex-
situ annealing temperature d). The decreasing of the abso-
lute gX -value for higher annealing temperatures implies an
increasing lateral expansion of the QDs and a modiﬁcation of
the composition and a strain variation in the QDs.

QDs per sample were investigated and the resulting mean
value was plotted. Spectra were taken every 0.5 T up
to a magnetic ﬂux density of 5 T. We assume that the
emission is completely circular polarized for T ≥ 1.5 T 22.
For each cap thickness a decrease of the Zeeman split-
ting and accordingly the g-factors |gX| is observable for
increasing annealing temperatures. According to equa-
tion 1 the eﬀective g-factor can be obtained by a linear
ﬁt. The absolute g-value |gX| of the QDs of the sample
with d = 2 nm drops from 1.71 ± 0.24 for the reference
sample to 0.86 ± 0.17 at a temperature of 800◦ C (cf.
ﬁg. 3 a)). We attribute this eﬀect to the interdiﬀusion
of the Ga- with the In-atoms which leads to a lateral
expansion of the QDs. According to Bayer et al.23 and
Kotlyar et al.24 gX should be proportional to 1/D2 (D
is the QD diameter). This eﬀect is caused by spin-orbit
interactions which increase with decreasing QD size due
to the uncertainty relation. Furthermore we would like
to note that also the composition in the QD signiﬁcantly
modiﬁes both with the annealing temperature and the
dot size, and thermal annealing additionally leads to a
strain variation in the QD which results in a reduction of
the absolute gX -value25. This is consistently observed in
ﬁg. 3d, where we depict all obtained g-factors for varying
cap thicknesses and annealing temperatures. The highest
absolute gX -value is measured for the reference sample

It should be noted that L is not equivalent to the phys-
ical expansion of our quantum dots as seen in the TEM
image in ﬁgure 1. The determined L value (8.1 nm) and
the average diameter of the quantum dots taken from
TEM analysis (25.8 nm) deviate signiﬁcantly. In order to
explain the diﬀerence we performed six-band-k·p model
based calculations of the wave functions, using the soft-
ware Nextnano27. For this, we used geometric parame-
ters taken from TEM analyis. The resulting mean diam-
eters of the wave functions are 9.8 nm for the electron

(cid:11) and 12.4 nm for the hole wave func-
(cid:11). Therefore, the signiﬁcant deviation between L

and D are not in contradiction.

C. Time resolved spectroscopy

According to equation 3 the OS is directly related to
the radiative decay time of the quantum emitter. There-
fore, measuring the lifetime τ of the QDs is another way
to study the inﬂuence of ex-situ RTA on the OS. Fig 5
a) exemplarily shows the QD ensemble emission of the
reference sample with d = 2 nm. In this range we per-
formed lifetime measurements by measuring gradually
the monochromator ﬁltered emission wavelength (spec-
tral range 0.2 nm) over the whole QD emission spectrum.
The lifetimes aquired at the spectral positions used for
determination of the diamagnetic shift and the Zeeman
splitting are plotted in ﬁg. 5 b).

One cleary sees that a higher annealing temperature
results in an enhancement of the spontaneous emission
decay rate. Since f is proportional to Γ = 1/τ we note
that the annealing procedure is a viable tool to increase
the QD’s oscillator strenght, as we detail in the next sec-
tion.

D. Oscillator strength

We now give a more detailed analysis of the data.
Based on equation 5 and 3 we can calculate the OS from
the experimental data. This calculation requires knowl-
edge of the In content in the QDs. The In content was
estimated in the following way: First, Nextnano simula-
tions were carried out for the as-grown QDs, by adjusting
the In content of the simulated QD in a way that the cal-
culated transition energies matched the experimentally

with d = 2 nm with |gX| = 1.71 ± 0.24 and the lowest
for the sample with a 4 nm cap annealed at 850◦ C with
|gX| = 0.059 ± 0.034. We note that the emission band of
the sample with a cap thickness of 4 nm was outside of
the detection window of our Si-CCD camera (both for the
reference sample and the sample piece that was annealed
at 750◦ C).

B. Diamagnetic coeﬃcient χ

Next, we study the diamagentic behavior of the emit-
ters as a function of the annealing conditions. We plot
the magnitude of the diamagnetic shift (which can be
obtained via the energy mean value of the σ+ and σ−
emission lines) against the square of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Then a linear ﬁt is applied to the data to extract the
diamagnetic coeﬃcient χ. The results are shown in ﬁg.
4.

For all three chosen cap thicknesses we observe a dis-
tinct increase of the diamagnetic coeﬃcient for higher ex-
situ annealing temperatures. In addition, an increasing χ
for the same temperatures and higher cap thicknesses can
be noted (for d = 3 nm). It is reasonable to assume that
thicker caps and higher temperatures lead to an increase
of the lateral expansion of the QDs since χ is propor-
tional to the expansion of the wave functions according

Taking a reference value of f = 10 for common not annealed InAs QD samples28 into account the ex-situ RTA process leads to
a signiﬁcant increase beyond a factor of 2 of the OS.

measured PL energies. The geometric parameters of the
QDs were taken from the TEM analysis. The STEM
analysis shows that the actual QD height (2.9 nm) is in
very good agreement with the nominal height of the cap-
ping layer (3 nm). Therefore, 2 nm, 2.9 nm and 4 nm
were used as QD heights for the respective samples. A
QD width of 26 nm was used for all three nominal cap-
ping layer heights since the QD width is not expected to
vary signiﬁcantly between diﬀerent capping procedures.
In a second step we performed a boxcar type smoothing
algorithm based on Fick’s law to simulate the reduction
of In content during the annealing process. The results
of this calculations are compiled in the third column of
table I. Finally, we use these estimations of the In content
to calculate the oscillator strength for the acquired data.
All other material dependent parameters were taken from
literature29–31.

Almost all values for f derived from the diamagnetic
shift as well from the lifetime measurements agree within

most all values for f agree within the error bars. The max-

V. SUMMARY

In conclusion with have systematically investigated the
inﬂuence of an ex-situ rapid thermal annealing process
on InAs/GaAs PCA QDs with various cap thicknesses
d. We studied the emission properties of these QDs in a
magnetic ﬁeld and extracted the eﬀective Land´e g-factor
and the diamagnetic coeﬃcient χ. Both show a strong
dependency on the annealing temperature as well as on
the cap thickness. From these measurements we could
derive the mean lateral expansion of the wavefunction
and the oscillator strength f of the QDs. Furthermore
we compared the results to time resolved measurements
to extract the oscillator strength f on the QD ensem-
ble. In these studies, we could conﬁrm that RTA has a
consistently positive eﬀect on the oscillator strength of
an InAs quantum emitter, which makes this technique
highly appealing for post growth engineering dynamic
emitter properties. We furthermore emphasize that both
approaches, namely time resolved spectroscopy and mag-
neto optical measurements yield values which are in very
good agreement.
