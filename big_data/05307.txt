Abstract— The paper considers the problem of cooperative
estimation for a linear uncertain plant observed by a network of
communicating sensors. We take a novel approach by treating
the ﬁltering problem from the view point of local sensors while
the network interconnections are accounted for via an uncertain
signals modelling of estimation performance of other nodes.
That is, the information communicated between the nodes is
treated as the true plant information subject to perturbations,
and each node is endowed with certain believes about these
perturbations during the ﬁlter design. The proposed distributed
ﬁlter achieves a suboptimal H∞ consensus performance. Fur-
thermore, local performance of each estimator is also assessed
given additional constraints on the performance of the other
nodes. These conditions are shown to be useful in tuning the
desired estimation performance of the sensor network.

I. INTRODUCTION

The research on cooperative ﬁltering and estimation of
networked systems has gained much momentum during
the past decade, aiming at developing efﬁcient estimation
algorithms for large assemblies of networked sensors [1]–
[5]. The mentioned references reﬂect the common trend in
the literature, where the main objective is to accomplish a
globally optimal or suboptimal estimation performance of the
network. Usually, the performance of individual sensors is
not considered in such problems. This observation motivates
the question about a relationship between the estimation
performance of the individual ﬁlters within a distributed
estimation network and the performance of the overall net-
work. This paper considers this problem within the speciﬁc
framework of distributed H∞ consensus estimation [4], [5].
Our approach also targets the global convergence problem
however not with a brute-force decoupling of the global
solution. Rather we deﬁne a local objective function in
terms of uncertain signals capturing the performance of the
other nodes. This leads to decoupling of the distributed ﬁlter
while implicitly maintaining a meaningful connection to the
network. This way, the local objective function abstracts the
dependence on other nodes, eliminating the need to consider
their exact models or their raw measurements. Nevertheless,
the convergence of the local ﬁlter is dependent on the rest of
the network and we provide conditions that render the H∞
convergence of the network of the ﬁlters. Furthermore, by
asserting further conditions on the individual performances
of the other nodes a guaranteed H∞ performance of the

individual ﬁlters is established. These conditions express that
if all the neighbours maintain a certain level of accuracy then
the local ﬁlter also guarantees a nominated H∞ performance.
To establish the above relationship, here we analyze the
distributed ﬁlter network consisting of estimators solving an
auxiliary optimal ﬁltering problem at every node. In that
sense, our approach bears some resemblance with decentral-
ized control where each controller is constructed to regulate a
local subsystem. The mentioned auxiliary ﬁltering problem
originates in [6], [7]; it was shown in [8] to yield inter-
connected consensus-type ﬁlters that exchange information
between the network nodes although the parameters for each
ﬁlter could be computed online in the decentralized fashion.
The new element of this paper compared with [8] is how
the neighboring information is interpreted by each node.
In [8], each node was considered to be agnostic about the
amount of energy in the error between the true state of the
plant and the neighbours’ estimates of that state. In contrast,
here we consider a model where each node perceives a
relationship between the energy in the neighbours’ error and
the accuracy of its own ﬁlter. We give a detailed discussion
of this idea later in the paper; for now we only note that
technically our model adds a constraint on the energy in the
error inputs arising in the auxiliary minimum energy prob-
lems. Such a constraint has the form of an Integral Quadratic
Constraint previously used in robust decentralized control
problems and ﬁltering problems; e.g., see [9], [10]. However,
unlike those problems, the parameters of the constraints used
here play the role of tunable parameters which are adjusted
according to the desired local and global performance. They
also serve as indicators of sensitivity of the individual ﬁlters
to the neighbours’ performance.

The main result of this paper are sufﬁcient conditions on
the network parameters that ensure H∞ performance of the
network consisting of the proposed minimum energy ﬁlters.
As mentioned, not only global disturbance attenuation is
guaranteed by these conditions, but also certain local H∞
properties of the node ﬁlters are established. We show that
these conditions admit the form of a convex semideﬁnite
program, which enables constructing a ﬁlter network yielding
a suboptimal disturbance attenuation.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND PRELIMINARIES

A. The plant and the distributed estimator

Consider a linear system

˙x = Ax + Bw,

x(0) = x0,

(1)

where x ∈ Rn and w ∈ Rm are, respectively, the state
and the unknown modeling disturbance input; the latter is
assumed to be L2 integrable on [0, ∞). The matrices A ∈
Rn×n and B ∈ Rn×m are known, however the initial state
x0 is unknown and is considered to be part of the uncertainty
about the system (1).

The main objective of the paper is to determine conditions
under which the plant state x(t) can be estimated by a
network of ﬁlters each using its plant measurement

yi = Cix + Divi,

(2)

where i = 1, 2, . . . , N indicates the measurement taken at
is
node i of the network. Each measurement yi ∈ Rpi
imperfect, it is subject to a measurement disturbance vi
taking values in Rmi that also belongs to the space L2[0, ∞)
by assumption. The coefﬁcients of each measured output
are matrices of the matching dimensions, Ci ∈ Rpi×n,
Di ∈ Rpi×mi, with Ei , DiD′

i > 0.

In addition to its direct measurements of the plant, each
node receives information from other nodes of the network,
of the form

cij = Wij ˆxj + Fij ǫij,

(3)

where ˆxj is the estimate of state x at the neighbouring
node j. The signal ǫij with values in Rmij represents the
communication errors or uncertainty in the communication
ij > 0.
channel, ǫij ∈ L2[0, ∞). We assume that Gij , Fij F ′
The network graph describing communications between
the ﬁltering nodes is assumed to be directed, its node and
edge sets are denoted V = {1, . . . , N } and E ⊆ V × V,
respectively. The neighborhood of node i, i.e., the set of
nodes which send information to node i, is denoted by Ni =
{j : (i, j) ∈ E} and its cardinality is denoted li. The Laplace
matrix of the network graph is denoted L [11].

Following [1], [2], [4] and many other papers on dis-
tributed estimation, we consider a class of consensus-based
interconnected ﬁlters each processing the direct measure-
ments yi and neighbours’ information cij by means of a
Luenberger-type observer of the form

˙ˆxi = Aˆxi + Li(yi − Ci ˆxi) + Xj∈Ni

Kij(cij − Wij ˆxi),

(4)

ˆxi(0) = ξi.

The estimation problem in this paper is to determine
coefﬁcients Li, Kij (which can be time-varying) that ensure
convergence of the network to trajectories of the plant, and
also guarantee an acceptable attenuation of the detrimental
effects of disturbances on the estimation error. Formally,
these properties are formulated as follows. Given a positive
semideﬁnite matrix P ∈ RnN ×nN and a collection of
positive semideﬁnite matrices Xi ∈ Rn×n, and constants γ2

i , i ∈ V, we wish to determine a collection of ﬁlters

and ¯γ2
of the form (4) that guarantee the following properties:
P1. In the absence of disturbances w, vi and ǫij, j ∈ Ni,
i = 1, . . . , N the estimation error of the ﬁlter ei(t) =
ˆxi(t) − x(t) converges to zero asymptotically.

P2. In the presence of disturbances, the network of ﬁlters (4)
attains the type of H∞ disturbance attenuation property

These properties formalize the desired attributes of a
distributed ﬁlter that we want to achieve. In particular, prop-
erty P2 speciﬁes the desired global disturbance attenuation
performance across the sensor network using a network of
decoupled ﬁlter equations (4). Note that decoupled equa-
tions governing the gains in ﬁlters (4) will be provided
later. Furthermore, property P3 articulates the desired lo-
cal disturbance attenuation provided that there is sufﬁcient
contribution from the neighbours. The sufﬁcient contribution
condition is quantitatively deﬁned later in the paper.

We remark that properties P1, P2 jointly generalize the
property of H∞ consensus introduced in [4]; also see [5],
[12]. For example, let P = (L + L⊤) ⊗ P0 where P0 =
0 ≥ 0, and L⊤ is the Laplacian matrix of the graph
P ′
obtained from the network graph by reversing its edges.
This choice of P results in the left hand side of (5) being
equal to the weighted H∞ disagreement cost between the
P0ds [4], [5], [13]. More
generally, letting P = (L + L⊤) ⊗ P0 + diag[P1 . . . PN ],
i > 0, reduces P1, P2 to the property of strong robust
Pi = P ′
synchronization introduced in [12]. In addition, property
P3 describes H∞ attenuation properties of individual node
ﬁlters. Including such property into analysis constitutes the
main difference between the problem posed above and the
previous work in the area of distributed estimation.

B. Representation of the neighboring information

To make performance analysis of individual ﬁlters possi-
ble, let us introduce the mismatch between the disturbance-
free information contained in the signal cij and the corre-
sponding true version of this information,
ηij = Wij (ˆxj − x) = −Wijej ∈ Rpij ,

j ∈ Ni.

(7)

With these signals the information received by sensor i can
be represented as

cij = Wij x + ηij + Fij ǫij,

j ∈ Ni.

(8)

Equation (8) can be regarded as an additional measurement
of the plant affected by disturbances ǫij and ηij.

Treating the signals ηij, for the purpose of ﬁlter derivation,
as the disturbances additional to w, vi and ǫij has an effect
of decoupling node i from its neighbours. Indeed, consider
the error dynamics of the ﬁlter (4) at node i,

neighbour, i.e., i ∈ Nk. This interpretation allowed us to
construct in [8] minimum energy ﬁlters of the form (4) with
the property that for any initial condition x0, arbitrary L2-

Here, γ2 and Ri = R′
i > 0 are a positive constant and
matrices whose existence is determined by certain LMI
conditions in [8]. Also, Zij = Z ′
ij > 0 are given matrices;
in [8] they were associated with the conﬁdence of node i
about performance of node j.

Condition (10) provides an H∞ type bound on the energy
in the ﬁlter estimation errors at node i expressed in terms
of the energy of the disturbances affecting that node, and
is similar to (6) in property P3. The important difference
between (10) and (6) is that the former condition includes
the energy in the signals ηij that depend on the neighbours’
accuracy. Also, according to (10), the same level of distur-
bance attenuation γ2 is stated for all nodes. Our goal is
to revisit the design of the ﬁlters (4) to obtain a possibly
sharper H∞ property for at least some of the local ﬁlters,
and for other ﬁlters, to provide a means for assessing their
local performance and sensitivity to the neighbours’ errors.
Owing to the relation ηij = −Wijej, from the viewpoint
of node i, the error dynamics of the network can be seen as
an interconnection of two systems, representing, respectively,
i’s own error dynamics and the errors dynamics of the rest
of the system; see Figure 1. Motivated by (10), we propose
the following condition to formally capture the sensitivity of
each node to the accuracy of its neighbours’ ﬁlters:
For every i, there exist positive deﬁnite symmetric matrices
¯Zij and constants dij ≥ 0, j ∈ Ni, such that for all t ∈

As a generalized form of the property (10), condition (11)
reﬂects how the neighbours’ accuracy inﬂuences the local
disturbance attenuation property (6) at every node. Therefore
in what follows, we will use condition (11) to establish (6),
i.e., (11) is the quantitative characteristic of the neighbours’
effort mentioned in P3.

To demonstrate the role of (11) more vividly, take for
example ¯Zij = ¯zijI, with a scalar ¯zij > 0 and suppose (6)
holds provided (11) is satisﬁed with a very small ¯zij. Since
according to (6), the energy in ei is bounded, (11) suggests
that node i can only tolerate relatively ‘small’ mismatch
inputs ηij to be able guarantee (6). However, a small energy
in ηij can only be accomplished by the corresponding
neighbour j. This suggests that the eigenvalues of ¯Zij may
be indicative of sensitivity of the local ﬁlters to ﬁdelity of its
neighbours’ estimates. In Section IV we will show that the
matrices ¯Zij can be computed jointly with the attenuation
levels γ2, ¯γ2
i . This provides the means for performance
tuning of the local ﬁlters.

Similarly, the constants dij in (11) describe the bound
on the estimation error energy that node i is prepared to
tolerate from its neighbour j, in response to (hypothetically)
estimating the perfectly known plant (w = 0) with the
utmost precision (ei = 0). Indeed, in this hypothetical case,
condition (11) reduces to a bound on the energy in the
mismatch disturbance signal ηij of the neighbour j.

C. Distributed estimation problem

We are now in a position to present a formal deﬁnition of
the distributed estimation problem described in Section II-A.
Problem 1: Determine a collection of ﬁlters of the form
(4) and matrices ¯Zij ∈ Rpij ×pij , j ∈ Ni, i ∈ V, and
i such that the following conditions hold:
constants γ2 and ¯γ2
(i) Given a positive semideﬁnite matrix P ∈ RnN ×nN ,
the network of ﬁlters (4) achieves properties P1 and
P2 with this P and the found γ2.

(ii) The following implication holds with the found ¯Zij and
i : If signals ηij (t), j ∈ Ni, satisfy (11), then the ﬁlter
¯γ2
(4) guarantees the satisfaction of condition (6), i.e., P3
is satisﬁed.

We stress that the global performance properties P1 and P2
of the proposed distributed ﬁlter will be proved without using
condition (11). The IQC (11) will only be used to guarantee
certain local performance of each node i subject to accept-
able performance of its neighbours. The latter development
will be analogous to how IQCs were used in the derivation
of decentralized robust controllers to quantify the uncertainty
arising from system interconnections; e.g, see [9], [14].
However, different from decentralized controllers in those
references, our aim is to maintain coupling between the
ﬁlters, to ensure cooperation between them.

III. DISTRIBUTED MINIMUM ENERGY FILTERING WITH

LOCAL PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES

In this section, our main results are presented. As was
explained in Section II-B, our goal is to obtain a converging
(in the H∞ sense) distributed ﬁlter which provides global
estimation performance described in item (i) of Problem 1,
and also characterize quantitatively the connection between
local H∞ properties of the ﬁlters and their sensitivity to
estimation accuracy of their neighbours.

To solve Problem 1, we ﬁrst introduce an auxiliary robust
minimum energy ﬁltering problem involving a modiﬁed ver-
sion of the standard minimum energy cost [6]. This cost func-
]′,
tional, depending on the signals w and ηi , [η′
affecting the measurements yi|[0,t] and {cij|[0,t] j ∈ Ni}
available at node i is as follows:

Here Ξi,t denotes the class of vector signals ηi obtained by
stacking up all ηij, j ∈ Ni, satisfying (11). Originated from
the minimum energy ﬁltering [6] and least square ﬁtting,
this problem will lead to the ‘most likely’ minimum-energy
i,t(·) compatible with the data at node i, y|[0,t],
trajectory x∗
cij|[0,t] [6]. The subscripts i, t at x∗
i,t(·) are to highlight that
i,t(·) is consistent with the data collected on
the trajectory x∗
the interval [0, t] at node i. By deﬁnition, the end point of this
trajectory is the minimum-energy estimate of the state x(t),
given the measurement data y|[0,t], cij|[0,t]: ˆxi(t) , x∗
i,t(t).
To solve the constrained optimization problem (13), we
apply the method of S-procedure [14]. In fact, since the cost
¯Ji,t(x, w, ηi) itself depends on ˆxi(·), this requires us to solve
a family of minimum energy ﬁltering problems, in which ˆxi
is replaced with an arbitrary signal ¯xi. Then we take the
ﬁxed point of the mapping ¯xi(t) → x∗
i,t(t) generated by this
family of minimum energy ﬁltering problems, as ˆxi(t). Due
to lack of space, we omit the details and proceed assuming
that ˆxi(t) is such a ﬁxed point.

Let τi ∈ Rn be a vector τi = [τi1 . . . τiN ]′ such that

τij > 0 if j ∈ Ni, and τij = 0 otherwise. Then deﬁne

optimization problem

(15)

For each t, x, the optimization problem (15) is a standard
optimal tracking problem with a ﬁxed terminal condition
x(t) = x, which has a unique solution under the condition

(12)

Compared to the standard minimum energy cost func-
tional, it includes the additional weighted penalty on the
tracking error at node i; see the last
term in (12). It
was shown in [8] that the inclusion of this term enforces
a guaranteed H∞-type performance of the ﬁlter while a
minimum energy estimate is sought; cf. [15]. The weight
matrix of this term, Ri = R′
i > 0, Ri ∈ Rn×n was
regarded as parameters of the ﬁlter, and a process of selecting
those matrices to optimize γ2 was proposed in [8]. However,
different from [8], the cost (12) does not include a direct
quadratic penalty on ηij. Instead, our derivation of the local
ﬁlters will impose the constraint (11) on the mismatch signals
ηij, j ∈ Ni.

With these modiﬁcations, the auxiliary robust minimum-
energy ﬁltering problem consists of determining a set of the
unknowns x, w, ηi compatible with the measurements yi and
the communications cij and minimizing the energy cost (12)
subject to the constraint (11):

τij < 1.

We now establish a relationship between this problem and
the constrained inner optimization problem in (13).

Let Ti(t, x) , {τi : (16) holds and ¯V τi

i (x, t) > −∞}.
Also for convenience, deﬁne a vector di ∈ Rn whose jth
component is dij if j ∈ Ni and is 0 otherwise.

Lemma 1: For every ˆxi(·), x ∈ Rn, if the corresponding
set Ti(t, x) is nonempty, then the value of the inner opti-

the ﬁlter (21) computes recursively the process ˆxτi

Compared with the distributed minimum energy ﬁlter
in [8], we have now obtained a family of suboptimal min-
imum energy ﬁlters for each node parametrized by τi ∈
¯Ti(+∞). To be able to apply Theorem 1, it is necessary
to have a method for computing at least one such vector τi
for every node i. In the next section, we will present an algo-
rithm that accomplishes this task. In addition, this algorithm
obtains the matrices ¯Zij and constants γ2
i consistent with the
found γ2, thus providing a complete solution to Problem 1.

The LMIs (22), (16) represent a linear constraint on the
variables ¯Yi = ¯Y ′
, Υij, τij > 0 (j ∈ Ni,
i = 1, . . . , N ), and γ−2. Since γ2 represents the disturbance
attenuation level in the distributed ﬁlter, a suitable set of
ﬁlter parameters is of interest which minimizes this variable.
This can be numerically achieved by solving the convex
optimization problem

subject to (22), (16).

Let γ∗2 be the value of the supremum in (23).

Theorem 2: Let the pair (A, B) be stabilizable. Given a
positive semideﬁnite weighting matrix P = P ′ ∈ RnN ×nN ,
i I and ¯Yi, j ∈ Ni,
suppose γ2 > γ∗2, τij, Υij, ¯γ−2
i = 1, . . . , N , are a feasible collection of matrices and
scalars that satisfy the constraints of the convex optimization
problem (23). Then each Riccati equation (20) with Ri =
(γ/¯γi)2 has a positive deﬁnite bounded solution on [0, ∞).
Furthermore, the corresponding ﬁltering algorithm (21), (20)
veriﬁes claims (i) and (ii) of Problem 1.

As Theorem 2 shows, solving the SDP problem (23)
allows us to determine the suboptimal γ2 as well as the
local disturbance attenuation levels ¯γ2
i that characterize local
performance of the node ﬁlters (see (6)) as well as the matri-
ces ¯Zij in condition (11) consistent with that performance.
Then sensitivity of performance of the obtained local ﬁlters
to the neighbours’ accuracy can be assessed using, e.g., the
eigenvalues of ¯Zij, as explained in Section II-B. This process
is illustrated in the example presented next.

V. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

In this section, a simulated network of ﬁve sensor nodes
is considered that are to estimate a three-dimensional plant.
The plant’s state matrix and the input matrix are

The matrix A corresponds to one of the regimes of the
controlled Chua electronic circuit considered in [13].

The network consists of ﬁve nodes,

its connectiv-
ity is described by the set of directed edges E =
{(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}. The
matrices Ci were taken from [13] to be C1 = C4 =
0.001 × [3.1923 − 4.6597 1] and C2 = C3 = C5 =
[−0.8986 0.1312 − 1.9703]. Note that none of the pairs
(A, Ci) are observable, with (A, C1) and A, C4) being not
detectable. Also following [13], all communication matrices
are taken to be Wij = I3×3 if (i, j) ∈ E. Also, we let
Di = 0.025I1×3 and Fij = 0.5I3×3.

For the above system two distributed ﬁlter designs were
compared. Both ﬁlters were designed to achieve a suboptimal
H∞ consensus performance, that is, in (5) we selected P =
(L+L⊤)⊗I, cf. [4], [5]. First, the optimization problem (23)
was solved with the above parameters. Next, an additional
constraint ¯Zij > 0.1I was imposed. The computed levels
of local H∞ attenuation ¯γ2
i and the minimum eigenvalues
of the computed matrices ¯Zij with which the Property P3
is guaranteed by Theorem 2 are shown in Table I. One
can see that in the ﬁrst case, the ﬁlters at nodes 1 and
4 have much larger constants ¯γ2
i and substantially smaller
values of eigenvalues of matrices ¯Zij. Together these features
indicate that these ﬁlters are signiﬁcantly more sensitive to
accuracy of their neighbours. This is not unexpected given
that the pairs (A, C1), (A, C4) are not detectable. The second

simulation indicates that robustness of the estimators with
respect to accuracy of their neighbours can be improved by
moderately increasing γ2 and ¯γ2
i .

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we proposed a distributed ﬁltering algorithm
by utilizing an H∞ minimum-energy ﬁltering approach to
the design of constituent ﬁlters. The algorithm employs a
decoupled computation of the individual ﬁlter coefﬁcients.
This is achieved by considering the estimation error of
neighbouring agents as additional exogenous disturbances
weighted according to the nodes’ conﬁdence in their neigh-
bours’ estimates. The conditions are obtained under which
the proposed ﬁlter to provides guaranteed internal stability
and desired disturbance attenuation of the network error
dynamics. In addition each local ﬁlter guarantees certain
disturbance attenuation when assisted by the neighbours.
We have also provided a simulation example that conﬁrms
convergence of the proposed ﬁlter in the case a system has
undetectable pairs (A, Ci) at some of the nodes. Tuning of
the ﬁlter is discussed to reduce the dependence of the local
ﬁlters from neighbours accurate estimates.
