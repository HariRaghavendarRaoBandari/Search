A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE UNIVERSAL ENVELOPING

ALGEBRA FUNCTOR TO CROSSED MODULES OF LEIBNIZ

ALGEBRAS

RAFAEL F. CASADO, XABIER GARC´IA-MART´INEZ, AND MANUEL LADRA

Abstract. The universal enveloping algebra functor between Leibniz and associative
algebras deﬁned by Loday and Pirashvili is extended to crossed modules. We prove that
the universal enveloping crossed module of algebras of a crossed module of Leibniz algebras
is its natural generalization. Then we construct an isomorphism between the category of
representations of a Leibniz crossed module and the category of left modules over its
universal enveloping crossed module of algebras. Our approach is particularly interesting
since the actor in the category of Leibniz crossed modules does not exist in general, so the
technique used in the proof for the Lie case cannot be applied. Finally we move on to the
framework of the Loday-Pirashvili category LM in order to comprehend this universal
enveloping crossed module in terms of the Lie crossed modules case.

1. Introduction

Leibniz algebras, which are a non-antisymmetric generalization of Lie algebras, were
introduced in 1965 by Bloh [3], who called them D-algebras and referred to the well-
known Leibniz identity as diﬀerential identity. In 1993 Loday [14] made them popular and
studied their (co)homology. From that moment, many authors have studied this structure,
obtaining very relevant algebraic results [16, 17] and applications to Geometry [13, 18] and
Physics [11].

Crossed modules of groups were described for the ﬁrst time by Whitehead in the late
1940s [24] as an algebraic model for path-connected CW-spaces whose homotopy groups
are trivial in dimensions greater than 2. From that moment, crossed modules of diﬀerent
algebraic objects, not only groups, have been considered, either as tools or as algebraic
structures in their own right. For instance, in [16] crossed modules of Leibniz algebras were
deﬁned in order to study cohomology.

Observe that in Ellis’s PhD thesis [10] it is proved that, given a category of Ω-groups C
such as the categories of associative and Leibniz algebras, crossed modules, cat1-objects,
internal categories and simplicial objects in C whose Moore complexes are of length 1 are

equivalent structures.
Internal categories can be described in terms of what Baez calls
strict 2-dimensional objects (see [2] for groups and [1] for Lie algebras). By analogy to
Baez’s terminology, crossed modules of associative algebras (respectively Leibniz algebras)
can be viewed as strict associative 2-algebras [12] (respectively strict Leibniz 2-algebras
[4, 23]).

In the case of Lie algebras, the universal enveloping algebra plays two important roles:
the category of representations of a Lie algebra is isomorphic to the category of left modules
over its universal enveloping algebra and it is right adjoint to the Liezation functor. For
Leibniz algebras, these roles are played by two diﬀerent functors: Loday and Pirashvili [16]
proved that, given a Leibniz algebra p, the category of left UL(p)-modules is isomorphic
to the category of p-representations, where UL(p) is the universal enveloping associative
algebra of p. On the other hand, if associative algebras are replaced by dialgebras, there
exist a universal enveloping dialgebra functor [15], which is right adjoint to the functor
that assigns to every dialgebra its corresponding Leibniz algebra.

Another very interesting point of view on the construction of UL(p) is explored in [17].
They introduce the tensor category of linear maps LM, also known as the Loday-Pirashvili
category. It is possible to deﬁne Lie and associative objects in that category and to con-
struct the universal enveloping algebra. Since a Leibniz algebra can be considered as a Lie
object in LM, it is remarkable that UL(p) can be obtained via the universal enveloping
algebra of the aforementioned Lie object in LM. This approach is especially useful for
studying the universal enveloping algebra of a Leibniz algebra in terms of Lie algebras.

As Norrie states in [20], it is surprising the ease of the generalization to crossed modules
of many properties satisﬁed by the objects in the base category.
In [6], the universal
enveloping dialgebra functor is extended to crossed modules. The aim of this article is to
extend to crossed modules the functor UL, to prove that the aforementioned isomorphism
between representations of a Leibniz algebra and left modules over its universal enveloping
algebra also exists, and to study the 2-dimensional version of UL in terms of Lie objects in
LM.

Observe that the analogous isomorphism between representations and left modules in
the case of Lie crossed modules can be easily proved via the actor, but this method cannot
be applied in our case, since the actor of a Leibniz crossed module does not necessarily exist
[4] (see [7] for the 1-dimensional case). This makes our approach especially interesting.

In Section 2 we recall some basic deﬁnitions and properties, such as the concept of crossed
module of associative and Leibniz algebras, along with the notions of the corresponding
cat1-objects. In Section 3 we give proper deﬁnitions of left modules over a crossed mod-
ule of associative algebras and representations of a Leibniz crossed module. In Section 4
we describe the generalization to crossed modules of the functor UL : Lb → Alg, that is
XUL : XLb → XAlg, which assigns to every Leibniz crossed module its corresponding uni-
versal enveloping crossed module of algebras. Additionally, we prove that XUL is a natural
generalization of UL, in the sense that it commutes (or commutes up to isomorphism) with
the two reasonable ways of regarding associative and Leibniz algebras as crossed modules.
In Section 5 we construct an isomorphism between the categories of representations of a
Leibniz crossed module and the left modules over its universal enveloping crossed module

A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE UNIVERSAL ENVELOPING ALGEBRA

of algebras. Finally, in Section 6, we introduce Lie and associative crossed modules in the
Loday-Pirashvili category and we prove that the factorization of the crossed module XUL(p)
via Lie crossed modules in LM also holds in the 2-dimensional case.

Notations and conventions. Throughout the paper, we ﬁx a commutative ring K with
unit. All algebras are considered over K. The categories of Lie, Leibniz and (non-unital)
associative algebras will be denoted by Lie, Lb and Alg, respectively.

2. Preliminaries

Deﬁnition 2.1 ([14]). A Leibniz algebra p over K is a K-module together with a bilinear
operation [ , ] : p × p → p, called the Leibniz bracket, which satisﬁes the Leibniz identity:

[[p1, p2], p3] = [p1, [p2, p3]] + [[p1, p3], p2],

for all p1, p2, p3 ∈ p. A morphism of Leibniz algebras is a K-linear map that preserves the
bracket.

We will denote by Lb the category of Leibniz algebras and morphisms of Leibniz algebras.
These are in fact right Leibniz algebras. For the opposite structure, that is [p1, p2]′ =
[p2, p1], the left Leibniz identity is

[p1, [p2, p3]′]′ = [[p1, p2]′, p3]′ + [p2, [p1, p3]′]′,

for all p1, p2, p3 ∈ p.

If the bracket of a Leibniz algebra p happens to be antisymmetric, then p is a Lie algebra.

Furthermore, every Lie algebra is a Leibniz algebra. For more examples, see [14].

Recall that a Leibniz algebra p acts on another Leibniz algebra q if there are two bilinear
maps p × q → q, (p, q) 7→ [p, q] and q × p → q, (q, p) 7→ [q, p], satisfying six relations, which
are obtained from the Leibniz identity by taking two elements in p and one in q (three
identities) and one element in p and two elements in q (three identities). Given an action
of a Leibniz algebra p on another Leibniz algebra q, it is possible to consider the semidirect
product q ⋊ p, whose Leibniz structure is given by:

[(q1, p1), (q2, p2)] = ([q1, q2] + [p1, q2] + [q1, p2], [p1, p2]),

for all (q1, p1), (q2, p2) ∈ q ⊕ p.

Deﬁnition 2.2 ([16]). A representation of a Leibniz algebra p is a K-module M equipped
with two actions p × M → M, (p, m) 7→ [p, m] and M × p → M, (m, p) 7→ [m, p], satisfying
the following three axioms:

[m, [p1, p2]] = [[m, p1], p2] − [[m, p2], p1],
[p1, [m, p2]] = [[p1, m], p2] − [[p1, p2], m],
[p1, [p2, m]] = [[p1, p2], m] − [[p1, m], p2],

for all m ∈ M and p1, p2 ∈ p.

A morphism f : M → N of p-representations is a K-linear map which is compatible with

the left and right actions of p.

Remark 2.3. Given a p-representation M, we can endow the direct sum of K-modules
M ⊕ p with a Leibniz structure such that M is an abelian ideal and p is a subalgebra. The
converse statement is also true. It is evident that the Leibniz structure of M ⊕ p is the one
of M ⋊ p, as described previously.

Deﬁnition 2.4 ([16]). Let pl and pr be two copies of a Leibniz algebra p. We will denote by
xl and xr the elements of pl and pr corresponding to x ∈ p. Consider the tensor K-algebra
T(pl ⊕ pr), which is associative and unital. Let I be the two-sided ideal corresponding to
the relations:

[x, y]r = xryr − yrxr,
[x, y]l = xlyr − yrxl,
(yr + yl)xl = 0.

for all x, y ∈ p. The universal enveloping algebra of the Leibniz algebra p is the associative
and unital algebra

This construction deﬁnes a functor UL : Lb → Alg.

UL(p) := T(pl ⊕ pr)/I.

Theorem 2.5 ([16]). The category of representations of the Leibniz algebra p is isomorphic
to the category of left modules over UL(p).

Proof. Let M be a representation of p. It is possible to deﬁne a left action of UL(p) on the
K-module M as follows. Given xl ∈ pl, xr ∈ pr and m ∈ M,

xl · m = [x, m],

xr · m = [m, x].

These actions can be extended to an action of T(pl ⊕ pr) by composition and linearity. It is
not complicated to check that this way M is equipped with a structure of left UL(p)-module.
it is immediate that, starting with a left UL(p)-
module, the restrictions of the actions to pl and pr give two actions of p which make
M into a representation.
(cid:3)

Regarding the converse statement,

Recall that a left module over an associative algebra A can be described as a morphism

α : A → End(M), where M is a K-module.

Both Lb and Alg are categories of interest, notion introduced by Orzech in [21]. See [19]
for a proper deﬁnition and more examples. Categories of interest are a particular case of
categories of groups with operations, for which Porter [22] described the notion of crossed
module. The following deﬁnitions agree with the one given by Porter.

Deﬁnition 2.6. A crossed module of Leibniz algebras (or Leibniz crossed module) (q, p, η)
is a morphism of Leibniz algebras η : q → p together with an action of p on q such that

η([p, q]) = [p, η(q)]
[η(q1), q2] = [q1, q2] = [q1, η(q2)],

and

η([q, p]) = [η(q), p],

for all q, q1, q2 ∈ q, p ∈ p.

A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE UNIVERSAL ENVELOPING ALGEBRA

A morphism of Leibniz crossed modules (ϕ, ψ) from (q, p, η) to (q′, p′, η′) is a pair of

Leibniz homomorphisms, ϕ : q → q′ and ψ : p → p′, such that

ψη = η′ϕ,
ϕ([p, q]) = [ψ(p), ϕ(q)]

and

ϕ([q, p]) = [ϕ(q), ψ(p)],

for all q ∈ q, p ∈ p.

Deﬁnition 2.7. A crossed module of algebras (B, A, ρ) is an algebra homomorphism
ρ : B → A together with an action of A on B such that

ρ(ab) = aρ(b)
ρ(b1)b2 = b1b2 = b1ρ(b2),

and

ρ(ba) = ρ(b)a,

for all a ∈ A, b1, b2 ∈ B.

A morphism of crossed modules of algebras (ϕ, ψ) : (B, A, ρ) → (B ′, A′, ρ′) is a pair of

algebra homomorphisms, ϕ : B → B ′ and ψ : A → A′, such that

ψρ = ρ′ϕ,
ϕ(ba) = ϕ(b)ψ(a)

and

ϕ(ab) = ψ(a)ϕ(b),

for all b ∈ B, a ∈ A.

We will denote by XLie, XLb and XAlg the categories of Lie crossed modules, Leibniz
crossed modules and crossed modules of associative algebras, respectively. Crossed modules
can be alternatively describe as cat1-objects, namely:

Deﬁnition 2.8. A cat1-Leibniz algebra (p1, p0, s, t) consists of a Leibniz algebra p1 together
with a Leibniz subalgebra p0 and the structural morphisms s, t : p1 → p0 such that

s|p0 = t|p0 = idp0,
[Ker s, Ker t] = 0 = [Ker t, Ker s],

(CLb1)

(CLb2)

Deﬁnition 2.9. A cat1-algebra (A1, A0, σ, τ ) consists of an algebra A1 together with a
subalgebra A0 and the structural morphisms σ, τ : A1 → A0 such that

σ|A0 = τ |A0 = idA0,
Ker σ Ker τ = 0 = Ker τ Ker σ.

(CAs1)

(CAs2)

It is a well-known fact that the category of crossed modules of Leibniz algebras (resp.
associative algebras) is equivalent to the category of cat1-Leibniz algebras (resp. associative
algebras) (see for instance [10] in the framework of categories of Ω-groups).

Given a crossed module of Leibniz algebras (q, p, η), the corresponding cat1-Leibniz
algebra is (q ⋊ p, p, s, t), where s(q, p) = p and t(q, p) = η(q) + p for all (q, p) ∈ q ⋊ p.
Conversely, given a cat1-Leibniz algebra (p1, p0, s, t), the corresponding Leibniz crossed
module is t|Ker s : Ker s → p0, with the action of p0 on Ker s induced by the bracket in p1.
The equivalence for associative algebras is analogous.

The standard functor liezation, Lie : Lb → Lie, p 7→ Lie(p), where Lie(p) is the quotient
of p by the ideal generated by the elements [p, p], for p ∈ p, can be extended to crossed
modules XLie : XLb → XLie.

Given a Leibniz crossed module (q, p, η) its liezation XLie(q, p, η) is deﬁned as the crossed

module (cid:0)

, Lie(p), η(cid:1), where [q, p]x is the ideal generated by the elements [q, p]+[p, q],

3. Representations of crossed modules

Since our intention is to extend Theorem 2.5 to crossed modules, it is necessary to give
a proper deﬁnition of representations over Leibniz crossed modules and left modules over
crossed modules of algebras.

In the case of crossed modules of associative algebras, by analogy to the 1-dimensional

situation, left modules can be described via the endomorphism crossed module:

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let (B, A, ρ) be a crossed module of algebras. A left (B, A, ρ)-module
is an abelian crossed module of algebras (V, W, δ), that is δ is simply a morphism of K-
modules and the action of W on V is trivial, together with a morphism of crossed modules
of algebras (ϕ, ψ) : (B, A, ρ) → (HomK(W, V ), End(V, W, δ), Γ).

Note that End(V, W, δ) is the algebra of all pairs (α, β), with α ∈ EndK(V ) and β ∈
EndK(W ), such that βδ = δα. Furthermore, Γ(d) = (dδ, δd) for all d ∈ HomK(W, V ). The
action of End(V, W, δ) on HomK(W, V ) is given by

(α, β) · d = αd

and

d · (α, β) = dβ,

for all d ∈ HomK(W, V ), (α, β) ∈ End(V, W, δ). See [5, 8] for further details.

Let (V, W, δ) and (V ′, W ′, δ′) be left (B, A, ρ)-modules with the corresponding homomor-
phisms of crossed modules of algebras (ϕ, ψ) : (B, A, ρ) → (HomK(W, V ), End(V, W, δ), Γ)
and (ϕ′, ψ′) : (B, A, ρ) → (HomK(W ′, V ′), End(V ′, W ′, δ′), Γ′). Then a morphism from
(V, W, δ) to (V ′, W ′, δ′) is a pair (fV , fW ) of morphisms of K-modules fV : V → V ′ and
fW : W → W ′ such that

fW δ = δ′fV ,

(fV , fW )ψ(a) = ψ′(a)(fV , fW ),

fV ϕ(b) = ϕ′(b)fW ,

for all b ∈ B, a ∈ A.

For the categories of crossed modules of groups and Lie algebras, representations can be
deﬁned via an object called the actor (see [9, 20]). However this is not the case for Leibniz
crossed modules (see [4]). Nevertheless, it is possible to give a deﬁnition by equations:

Deﬁnition 3.2. A representation of a Leibniz crossed module (q, p, η) is an abelian Leibniz
crossed module (N, M, µ) endowed with:

A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE UNIVERSAL ENVELOPING ALGEBRA

7

(i) Actions of the Leibniz algebra p (and so q via η) on N and M, such that the

homomorphism µ is p-equivariant, that is

µ([p, n]) = [p, µ(n)],

µ([n, p]) = [µ(n), p],

for all n ∈ N and p ∈ p.

(ii) Two K-bilinear maps ξ1 : q × M → N and ξ2 : M × q → N such that

µξ2(m, q) = [m, q],
µξ1(q, m) = [q, m],
ξ2(µ(n), q) = [n, q],

ξ1(cid:0)q, µ(n)(cid:1) = [q, n],

ξ2(m, [p, q]) = ξ2([m, p], q) − [ξ2(m, q), p],
ξ1([p, q], m) = ξ2([p, m], q) − [p, ξ2(m, q)],
ξ2(m, [q, p]) = [ξ2(m, q), p] − ξ2([m, p], q),
ξ1([q, p], m) = [ξ1(q, m), p] − ξ1(q, [m, p]),
ξ2(m, [q, q′]) = [ξ2(m, q), q′] − [ξ2(m, q′), q],
ξ1([q, q′], m) = [ξ1(q, m), q′] − [q, ξ2(m, q′)],
ξ1(q, [p, m]) = −ξ1(q, [m, p]),
[p, ξ1(q, m)] = −[p, ξ2(m, q)],

for all q, q′ ∈ q, p ∈ p, n ∈ N m, m′ ∈ M.

A morphism between two representations (N, M, µ) and (N ′, M ′, µ′) of a Leibniz crossed
module (q, p, η) is a morphism of abelian Leibniz crossed modules (fN , fM ) : (N, M, µ) →
(N ′, M ′, µ′) that preserves the actions together with the morphisms from (ii).

Remark 3.3. As in Remark 2.3, given a (q, p, η)-representation (N, M, µ), we can obtain a
Leibniz crossed module structure on (N ⋊ q, M ⋊ p, µ ⊕ η) where (N, M, µ) is an abelian
crossed ideal and (q, p, η) is a crossed submodule of (N ⋊ q, M ⋊ p, µ ⊕ η) respectively. The
converse statement is also true. Moreover, a representation can be seen as an action of
(q, p, η) over an abelian Leibniz crossed module (N, M, µ) in the sense of [4].

module

algebra

with s(q, p) = p and t(q, p) = η(q) + p for all (q, p) ∈ q ⋊ p. Now, if we apply UL to the
previous diagram, we get

UL(q ⋊ p)

UL(s)

UL(t)

/ UL(p) .

Although it is true that UL(s)|UL(p) = UL(t)|UL(p) = idUL(p), in general, the second condition
for cat1-algebras (CAs2) is not satisﬁed. Nevertheless, we can consider the quotient UL(q ⋊
p) = UL(q ⋊ p)/X , where X = Ker UL(s) Ker UL(t) + Ker UL(t) Ker UL(s), and the induced
morphisms UL(s) and UL(t). In this way, the diagram

UL(q ⋊ p)

UL(s)

UL(t)

/ UL(p)

is clearly a cat1-algebra. Note that UL(p) can be regarded as a subalgebra of UL(q ⋊ p).

We can now deﬁne XUL(q, p, η) as the crossed module of associative algebras given by

(Ker UL(s), UL(p), UL(t)|Ker UL(s)). This construction deﬁnes a functor XUL : XLb → XAlg.

Immediately below we prove a very helpful lemma which gives us a proper description

of Ker UL(s).

Lemma 4.1. The elements of the form (q1, p1)⊗· · ·⊗(qk, pk) such that there exist 1 ≤ i ≤ k
with pi = 0, generate Ker UL(s).

Proof. Let J be the ideal of T(pl ⊕ pr) generated by the three relations of Deﬁnition 2.4.

Let I be the ideal of T(cid:0)(q ⋊ p)l ⊕ (q ⋊ p)r(cid:1) generated by the preimage by T(s) of those

relations. Then I is the ideal generated by

(q1, p)r ⊗ (q2, p′)r − (q3, p′)r ⊗ (q4, p)r − (q5, [p, p′])r,
(q1, p)r ⊗ (q2, p′)l − (q3, p′)l ⊗ (q4, p)r − (q5, [p, p′])l,
(q1, p)r ⊗ (q2, p′)l + (q1, p)l ⊗ (q2, p′)l.

Additionally, the kernel of T(s) is generated by elements as those in the statement of this
lemma and by elements of the form (q1, p1)α1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (qk, pk)αk − (q′
k, pk)αk ,
where αk can be r or l. Since T(s) is surjective, the kernel of UL(s) will be generated by I
and Ker T(s). Let us check that all these generators are of the claimed form.
Given (q1, p′)α1 ⊗ (q2, p)α2 − (q3, p′)α1 ⊗ (q4, p)α2 ∈ Ker T(s), we have that

1, p1)α1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (q′

(q1, p′)α1 ⊗ (q2, p)α2 − (q3, p′)α1 ⊗ (q4, p)α2
= (q1, p′)α1 ⊗ (q2, p)α2 − (q3, p′)α1 ⊗ (q4, p)α2 + (q1, p′)α1 ⊗ (q4, p)α2 − (q1, p′)α1 ⊗ (q4, p)α2
= (q1, p′)α1 ⊗ (q2 − q4, 0)α2 + (q1 − q3, 0)α1 ⊗ (q4, p)α2.

By induction one can easily derive that the elements in Ker T(s) are of the expected form.

Let us take (q1, p)r ⊗ (q2, p′)r − (q3, p′)r ⊗ (q4, p)r − (q5, [p, p′])r ∈ I. Then,

(q1, p)r⊗(q2, p′)r − (q3, p′)r ⊗ (q4, p)r − (q5, [p, p′])r

= (q1, p)r ⊗ (q2, p′)r − (q4, p)r ⊗ (q3, p′)r + [(q4, p), (q3, p′)]r − (q5, [p, p′])r
= (q1, p)r ⊗ (q2, p′)r − (q4, p)r ⊗ (q3, p′)r + (q′, [p, p′])r − (q5, [p, p′])r
= (q1, p)r ⊗ (q2, p′)r − (q4, p)r ⊗ (q3, p′)r + (q′ − q5, 0)r,

and then we proceed as in the previous case. For the second and third identities the
argument is similar.
(cid:3)

Observe that there are full embeddings

I0, I1 : Alg −→ XAlg

(resp.

J0, J1 : Lb −→ XLb)

deﬁned, for an associative algebra A (resp. for a Leibniz algebra p), by I0(A) = ({0}, A, 0),

I1(A) = (A, A, idA)(cid:0)resp. J0(p) = ({0}, p, 0), J1(p) = (p, p, idp)(cid:1). The functor XUL : XLb →

XAlg is a natural generalization of the functor UL, in the sense that it makes the following
diagram commute,

Lb

J0

/ XLb

UL

XUL

Alg

/ XAlg

I0

Regarding the embeddings I1 and J1, we have the following result.

Proposition 4.2. There is a natural isomorphism of functors

XUL ◦ J1

∼= I1 ◦ UL .

Proof. Let p ∈ Lb.
It is necessary to prove that XUL(p, p, idp) is naturally isomorphic
to (UL(p), UL(p), idUL(p)). In order to do so, we will show that (UL(t)|Ker UL(s), idUL(p)) is an
isomorphism of crossed modules of algebras between (Ker UL(s), UL(p), UL(t)|Ker UL(s)) and
(UL(p), UL(p), idUL(p)).

It is easy to check that (UL(t)|Ker UL(s), idUL(p)) is indeed a morphism of crossed modules
of algebras. Recall that the ﬁrst step in the construction of XUL(p, p, idp) requires us to
consider the cat1-Leibniz algebra

p ⋊ p

s

t

/ p ,

with s(p, p′) = p′ and t(p, p′) = p + p′ for all p, p′ ∈ p. Let us deﬁne the Leibniz homomor-
phism ǫ : p → p ⋊ p, ǫ(p) = (p, 0). It is clear that sǫ = 0 and tǫ = idp.

The next step is to apply the functor UL on the previous cat1-Leibniz algebra and take
the quotient of UL(p ⋊ p) by X = Ker UL(s) Ker UL(t) + Ker UL(t) Ker UL(s) in order to

UL(t)

where π is the canonical projection, it is easy to see that UL(s)π UL(ǫ) = UL(s) UL(ǫ) =
UL(sǫ) = 0 and UL(t)π UL(ǫ) = UL(t) UL(ǫ) = UL(tǫ) = idUL(p). Hence π UL(ǫ) takes values in
Ker UL(s) and it is a right inverse for UL(t)|Ker UL(s).

Now we need to show that π UL(ǫ)UL(t) = idKer UL(s). Note that X ⊂ Ker UL(s), so
Ker UL(s) = Ker UL(s)/X and, as proved in Lemma 4.1, Ker UL(s) is generated by all the
elements of the form

(4.1)
j ∈ p, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k. By the deﬁnition of UL(t) and UL(ǫ), the value of UL(ǫ) UL(t)

1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pi, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pk, p′

(p1, p′

with pj, p′
on (4.1) is

(p1 + p′

1, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pi, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pk + p′

k, 0).

(4.2)

Furthermore, one can easily derive that, in Ker UL(s)/X ,

(p1 + p′
= (p1, p′

1, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pi, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pk + p′
1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pi, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pk + p′

k, 0)
k, 0),

By applying the same procedure as many times as required, one can deduce that

(p1 + p′
= (p1, p′

1, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pi, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pk + p′
1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pi, 0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (pk, p′
k).

k, 0)

Thus, the elements (4.1) and (4.2) are equal in Ker UL(s)/X and it follows that

π UL(ǫ)UL(t)|Ker UL(s) = idKer UL(s) .

Therefore we have found an inverse for the morphism of crossed modules of algebras
(UL(t)|Ker UL(s), idUL(p)). It is fairly easy to prove that this construction is natural.

5. Isomorphism between the categories of representations

In this section, we give the construction of an isomorphism between the categories of
representations of a Leibniz crossed module and left modules over its corresponding uni-
versal enveloping crossed module of algebras. Recall that the method used in the proof of
the equivalent result in the case of Lie algebras cannot be applied in our case due to the
lack of actor in the category of Leibniz crossed modules.

Theorem 5.1. The category of representations of a Leibniz crossed module (q, p, η) is
isomorphic to the category of left modules over its universal enveloping crossed module of
algebras XUL(q, p, η).

A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE UNIVERSAL ENVELOPING ALGEBRA

Proof. Let (N, M, µ) be a left (Ker UL(s), UL(p), UL(t)|Ker UL(s))-module. Then we have a
homomorphism

(ϕ, ψ) : (Ker UL(s), UL(p), UL(t)|Ker UL(s)) → (HomK(M, N), End(N, M, µ), Γ),

such that ψ ◦ UL(t)|Ker UL(s) = Γ ◦ ϕ, ϕ(ba) = ϕ(b)ψ(a) and ϕ(ab) = ψ(a)ϕ(b). We need to
deﬁne actions of p on N and M satisfying (LbEQ1) and (LbEQ2) and we need to deﬁne
ξ1 : q × M → N and ξ2 : M × q → N satisfying identities (LbM1a)–(LbM5b).

We deﬁne the actions of p on N and M as those induced by ψ : UL(p) → End(N, M, µ)
as in Theorem 2.5. The identities (LbEQ1) and (LbEQ2) are followed by the properties

of End(N, M, µ). We deﬁne the morphisms ξ1 and ξ2 by ξ1(q, m) = ϕ(cid:0)(q, 0)l(cid:1)(m) and
ξ2(m, q) = ϕ(cid:0)(q, 0)r(cid:1)(m). The identities (LbM1a), (LbM2a) and (LbM1b), (LbM2b) are

followed by the commutative square ψ ◦ UL(t)|Ker UL(s) = Γ ◦ ϕ applied to the elements (q, 0)r
and (q, 0)l respectively. Given the element ([p, q], 0)r ∈ Ker UL(s), we have that

([p, q], 0)r = [(0, p)r, (q, 0)r] = (0, p)r(q, 0)r − (q, 0)r(0, p)r.

Applying ϕ to this relation and using that ϕ(ba) = ϕ(b)ψ(a) and ϕ(ab) = ψ(a)ϕ(b) we

obtain ϕ(cid:0)([p, q], 0)r(cid:1) = ψ2(pr)ϕ(cid:0)(q, 0)r(cid:1) − ϕ(cid:0)(q, 0)r(cid:1)ψ1(pr) which implies (LbM3a). Pro-

ceeding in the same way for the elements ([p, q], 0)l, ([q, p], 0)r and ([q, p], 0)l we check that
identities (LbM3b), (LbM3c) and (LbM3d) are satisﬁed. Doing a similar argument on the
elements ([q, q′], 0)r and ([q, q′], 0)l we obtain identities (LbM4a) and (LbM4b). Applying
ϕ to the relations

(0, p)l(q, 0)l = −(0, p)r(q, 0)l

and

(q, 0)l(0, p)l = −(q, 0)r(0, p)l

we have identities (LbM5a) and (LbM5b) respectively.

Conversely, let (N, M, µ) be a (q, p, η)-representation. We need to construct a morphism
of crossed modules of algebras (ϕ, ψ) from XUL(q, p, η) to (HomK(M, N), End(N, M, µ), Γ).
The homomorphism ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) : UL(p) → End(N, M, µ) is the homomorphism induced
by the actions of p on N and M as in Theorem 2.5. It is well deﬁned due to identities
(LbEQ1) and (LbEQ2). Consider the homomorphism Φ : (q ⋊ p)l ⊕ (q ⋊ p)r → HomK(N ⊕
M, N ⊕ M) deﬁned by

Φ(q, p)l(n, m) = ([q, n] + [p, n] + ξ1(q, m), [p, m]),
Φ(q, p)r(n, m) = ([n, q] + [n, p] + ξ2(m, q), [m, p]).

Note that they can also be rewritten as

Φ(q, p)l(n, m) = (cid:0)t(q, p)l(n) + ξ1(q, m), s(q, p)l(m)(cid:1),
Φ(q, p)r(n, m) = (cid:0)t(q, p)r(n) + ξ2(m, q), s(q, p)r(m)(cid:1).

By the universal property of the tensor algebra, there is a unique homomorphism

T(Φ) : T(cid:0)(q ⋊ p)l ⊕ (q ⋊ p)r(cid:1) → HomK(N ⊕ M, N ⊕ M),

commuting with the inclusion.

12

RAFAEL F. CASADO, XABIER GARC´IA-MART´INEZ, AND MANUEL LADRA

We consider the projection π : HomK(N ⊕ M, N ⊕ M) → HomK(M, N ⊕ M), where
π(f )(m) = f (0, m), and denote ϕ′ = π◦T(Φ). Given an element of the form (q′, p′)r(q, p)r −
(q, p)r(q′, p′)r + [(q, p)r, (q′, p′)r] we obtain that

ϕ′(cid:0)(q′, p′)r(q, p)r − (q, p)r(q′, p′)r + [(q, p)r, (q′, p′)r](cid:1)(m)

= [ξ2(m, q′), q] +(cid:2)[m, p′], q(cid:3) + [ξ2(m, q′), p]
− [ξ2(m, q), q′] −(cid:2)[m, p], q′(cid:3) − [ξ2(m, q), p′]

+ ξ2(m, [q, q′]) + ξ2(m, [q, p′]) + ξ2(m, [q′, p]) = 0,

by the properties of ξ2.

Analogously, it is possible to prove that ϕ′ vanishes on the other two relations of the
universal enveloping algebra. Then ϕ′ factors through UL(q ⋊ p). In order to ease notation
we will refer to it as ϕ′ as well.

have that

By deﬁnition it is clear that ϕ′|Ker UL(s)(M) ⊆ N and T(Φ)(cid:0)(q ⋊ p)l ⊕ (q ⋊ p)r(cid:1)(N) =
T(t)(cid:0)(q ⋊ p)l ⊕ (q ⋊ p)r(cid:1)(N). Then ϕ′ factors through Ker UL(t) Ker UL(s). Moreover, we
ϕ′(cid:0)(q, p)r(q′, p′)r(cid:1)(m) = (cid:0)[ξ2(m, q), q′] + [ξ2(m, q), p′] + ξ2([m, p], q),(cid:2)[m, p], p′(cid:3)(cid:1)

= (cid:0)ξ2(m, [t(q, p)r, q′]) + [ξ2(m, q′), t(q, p)r] + [ξ2(m, q), s(q′, p′)r], s(q′, p′)rs(q, p)rm(cid:1).

Extending this argument we see that ϕ′ also factors through Ker UL(s) Ker UL(t).

6. Relation with the Loday-Pirashvili category

In [17], Loday and Pirashvili introduced a very interesting way to see Leibniz algebras
as Lie algebras over another tensor category diﬀerent from K-Mod, the tensor category of
linear maps, denoted by LM. In this section we will extend this construction to crossed

modules and check that the relation with the universal enveloping algebra still holds in the
2-dimensional case.

Deﬁnition 6.1 ([17]). Let M and g be K-modules. The objects in LM are K-module
homomorphisms (M α→ g). In order to ease notation we will simply write (M, g) if there
β
is no possible confusion. Given two objects M α→ g and N
→ h, an arrow is a pair of
K-module homomorphisms ̺1 : M → N and ̺2 : g → h such that β ◦ ̺1 = ̺2 ◦ α. LM is
a tensor category with the tensor product deﬁned as

(M α→ g) ⊗ (N

β

→ h) = (cid:0)(M ⊗ h) ⊕ (g ⊗N)

α⊗1h+1g⊗β

−−−−−−−→ g ⊗ h(cid:1).

An associative algebra in LM is an object (A

β
→ R) where R is an associative K-algebra,

A is a R-bimodule and β is a homomorphism of R-bimodules.

A Lie algebra in LM is an object (M α→ g) where g is a Lie algebra, M is a right
g-representation and α is g-equivariant. Given a Lie algebra object in LM, its universal
enveloping algebra in LM is (U(g) ⊗ M → U(g)), 1 ⊗ m 7→ α(m). The action is given by

g(x ⊗ m) = gx ⊗ m

and

(x ⊗ m)g = xg ⊗ m + x ⊗ [m, g], g, x ∈ g, m ∈ M.

A Leibniz algebra p can be viewed as a Lie algebra object in LM, namely p → Lie(p).

Deﬁnition 6.2. Let (A α→ R) and (B
there is an action of (A, R) on (B, S) if we have the following:

β
→ S) be two associative algebras in LM. We say

• An action of algebras of R on S;
• an R-bimodule structure on B, compatible with the action of S;
• two homomorphisms ξ1 : A ⊗R S → B and ξ2 : S ⊗R A → B, such that ξ1(a, s)s′ =

ξ1(a, ss′), sξ1(a, s′) = ξ2(s, a)s′, sξ2(s′, a) = ξ2(ss′, a);

• β is also a homomorphism of R-bimodules, such that β(cid:0)ξ1(a, s)(cid:1) = α(a)s and
β(cid:0)ξ2(s, a)(cid:1) = sα(a).

A crossed module of associative algebras in LM is an arrow (ω1, ω2) : (B, S) → (A, R) and
an action of (A, R) on (B, S) such that

• ω2 with the action of R on S is a crossed module of associative algebras;

• ω1 is a homomorphism of R-bimodules satisfying aω2(s) = ω1(cid:0)ξ1(a, s)(cid:1), ω2(s)a =
ω1(cid:0)ξ2(s, a)(cid:1), ξ1(cid:0)ω1(b), s(cid:1) = bω2(s) = bs and ξ2(cid:0)s, ω1(b)(cid:1) = ω2(s)b = sb.

Let (ω1, ω2) : (B, S, β) → (A, R, α) be a crossed module of algebras in LM. We can

associate to it the crossed module of algebras

(B ⊕ S, A ⊕ R, ω1 ⊕ ω2),

(6.1)

where

(a, r)(a′, r′) = (α(a)a′ + ar′ + ra′, rr′),
(b, s)(b′, s′) = (β(b)b′ + bs′ + sb′, ss′),

a, a′ ∈ A, r, r′ ∈ R,
b, b′ ∈ B, s, s′ ∈ S.

Deﬁnition 6.3. Let (M α→ g) and (N
a right action of (M, g) on (N, h) if we have the following:

β
→ h) be two Lie algebras in LM. We say there is

14

RAFAEL F. CASADO, XABIER GARC´IA-MART´INEZ, AND MANUEL LADRA

• Compatible right Lie actions of g on h and N;
• a homomorphism ξ : M ⊗ h → N such that [ξ(m, h), g] = ξ([m, g], h) + ξ(m, [h, g])

and ξ(m, [h, h′]) = [ξ(m, h), h′] − [ξ(m, h′), h];

• α is h-equivariant and it satisﬁes that α(cid:0)ξ(m, h)(cid:1) = [α(m), h].

A crossed module of Lie algebras in LM is an arrow (̺1, ̺2) : (N, h) → (M, g) and an
action of (M, g) on (N, h) such that

• ̺2 with the right Lie action of g on h is a crossed module of Lie algebras;

• ̺1 is a g-equivariant homomorphism such that ̺1(cid:0)ξ(m, h)(cid:1) = [m, ̺2(h)] and [n, h] =

ξ(̺1(n), h) = [n, ̺2(h)].

Let (̺1, ̺2) : (N, h) → (M, g) be a Lie crossed module in LM. We construct the semidi-
rect product in LM by obtaining a Lie object (N ⊕ M, h ⋊ g), where [(n, m), (h, g)] =
([n, h] + [n, g] + ξ(m, h), [m, g]). Let (s1, s2) and (t1, t2) be two arrows in LM

where s1(n, m) = m, s2(h, g) = g and t1(n, m) = ̺1(n) + m, t2(h, g) = ̺2(h) + g. We apply
the universal enveloping algebra functor in LM to the previous diagram.

Considering U(g) as a subalgebra of U(h ⋊ g), there are induced algebra actions of U(g)

on U(h ⋊ g) and on U(h ⋊ g) ⊗ (N ⊕ M). There are also two morphisms

ξ1 : (U(g) ⊗ M) ⊗U(g) U(h ⋊ g) → U(h ⋊ g) ⊗ (N ⊕ M),

ξ2 : U(h ⋊ g) ⊗U(g) (U(g) ⊗ M) → U(h ⋊ g) ⊗ (N ⊕ M),

where ξ1(cid:0)(1 ⊗ m), (h, g)(cid:1) = (h, g) ⊗ (0, m) + 1 ⊗ (ξ(m, h), [m, g]) and ξ2(cid:0)(h, g), (1 ⊗ m)(cid:1) =

(h, g) ⊗ (0, m), where ξ : M ⊗ h → N is the homomorphism from the action of (M, g) on
(N, h). These actions and homomorphisms deﬁne an action of algebras in LM.

Let us consider the ideal of U(h ⋊ g) ⊗ (N ⊕ M) given by Y ′ = Ker U(s1) Ker U(t2) +
Ker U(s2) Ker U(t1) + Ker U(t1) Ker U(s2) + Ker U(t2) Ker U(s1) and the ideal of U(h ⋊ g) given
by X ′ = Ker U(s2) Ker U(t2) + Ker U(t2) Ker U(s2).

are well deﬁned. Moreover, the actions of U(g) on U(h ⋊ g) and U(h ⋊ g) ⊗ (N ⊕ M) and
the morphisms ξ1 and ξ2 factor through X ′ and Y ′.

Proof. Since the bottom row is the Lie algebra case, the proof can be found in [4]. The
top row follows by deﬁnition of Y ′. The homomorphism U(β ⊕ α) is zero in Y ′ by the
equivariance of α ⊕ β and the commutativity of the diagram. Again, the action of U(g)
on X ′ is zero since we are exactly in the Lie case. It is obvious that X ′ acts trivially on
U(h ⋊ g) ⊗ (N ⊕ M) and that U(h ⋊ g), and consequently U(g), acts trivially on Y ′. Let 1 ⊗

m ∈ U(g) ⊗M. Then ξ2(cid:0) Ker U(s2) Ker U(t2), 1 ⊗m(cid:1) = Ker U(s2) Ker U(t2) ⊗(0, m) ⊆ Y ′ and
the same happens for Ker U(t2) Ker U(s2). On the other hand, ξ1(cid:0)1 ⊗m, Ker U(s2) Ker U(t2)(cid:1)

is equal to Ker U(s2) Ker U(t2) ⊗ (0, m) ⊆ Y ′ plus Ker U(s2) Ker U(t2) acting on 1 ⊗ (0, m),
which clearly is also inside Y ′.
(cid:3)

We consider now (cid:0) Ker U(s1), Ker U(s2)(cid:1). The restriction of (cid:0)U(t1), U(t2)(cid:1) and U(β ⊕ α)

to this kernel will be denoted in the same way by abuse of notation. Then we have the
following result.

Theorem 6.5. Let (̺1, ̺2) : (N, h) → (M, g) be a Lie crossed module in LM. The follow-
ing square illustrates a crossed module of algebras in LM with the induced actions

U(t1)

/ U(g) ⊗ M

Ker U(s2)

Moreover, it is the universal enveloping crossed module of algebras of (̺1, ̺2) : (N, h) →
(M, g) in LM.

Proof. The action is studied in Lemma 6.4, and the bottom row is a crossed module of
algebras since is just the Lie algebra case. The second condition is followed straightforward
from deﬁnitions of ξ1 and ξ2.

Let us now consider a crossed module of Leibniz algebras (q, p, η). It can be viewed as

a crossed module of Lie algebras in LM as a square

η

Lie(q)
[q, p]x

/ Lie(p)

We can consider its universal enveloping algebra, obtaining that way a crossed module of
algebras in LM

Ker U(s1)

U(t1)

U(cid:0) Lie(p)(cid:1) ⊗ p

Following the construction (6.1) we obtain its corresponding crossed module of associative
algebras in the classical setting

/ U(cid:0) Lie(p)(cid:1)

(cid:18) Ker U(s1) ⊕ Ker U(s2),(cid:0) U(Lie(p)) ⊗ p(cid:1) ⊕ U(Lie(p)),(cid:0)U(t1), U(t2)(cid:1)(cid:19).

Theorem 6.6. Let (q, p, η) be a crossed module of Leibniz algebras. Its universal enveloping
crossed module of algebras XUL(q, p, η) is isomorphic to the crossed module of algebras
deﬁned above.

Proof. We have the following diagram

U(cid:0) Lie(q ⋊ p)(cid:1) ⊗ (q ⋊ p)

U(t1)

/ U(cid:0) Lie(p)(cid:1) ⊗ p

U(cid:0) Lie(q ⋊ p)(cid:1)

U(t2)

/ U(cid:0) Lie(p)(cid:1)

By [16, (2.4) Proposition] we know that the direct sum of the two objects of the ﬁrst
column is isomorphic to UL(q ⋊ p) and the direct sum of the objects of the second column
is isomorphic to UL(p). Let X be the ideal Ker UL(s) Ker UL(t) + Ker UL(t) Ker UL(s) deﬁned
in Section 4. Consider the isomorphism

θ : UL(q ⋊ p) ∼−→ (cid:18) U(cid:16) Lie(q)

[q, p]x

⋊ Lie(p)(cid:17) ⊗ (q ⋊ p)(cid:19) ⊕ U(cid:16) Lie(q)

[q, p]x

deﬁned on generators by θ(cid:0)(q, p)r(cid:1) = (q, p) and θ(cid:0)(q, p)l(cid:1) = 1 ⊗ (q, p). We need to check

that it maps X to X ′ + Y ′ and θ−1 maps X ′ + Y ′ to X , but this follows straightforward by
the deﬁnitions of X , X ′ and Y ′ completing the proof.
