Counting indices of critical points of rank two

of polynomial selfmaps of R4

by Zbigniew Szafraniec

Abstract For a generic f ∈ C ∞(R4, R4) there is a discrete set Σ2(Df ) of
critical points of rank two, and there is an integer index Ip(Df ) associated

to any p ∈ Σ2(Df ). We show how to compute P Ip(Df ), p ∈ Σ2(Df ), in

the case where f is a polynomial mapping.

1 Introduction

Assume that f : M → N is a C 1-mapping between 4-dimensional oriented
manifolds. We shall denote by Σ2(Df ) the set of those critical points of f
where the derivative Df is of rank two. According to the Thom transversality
theorem, critical points of a generic f have rank ≥ 2, and the set Σ2(Df ) is
discrete.

Several authors observed that one may associate an index Ip(Df ) to each
p ∈ Σ2(Df ). If M is a closed manifold then the algebraic sum of indices

#Σ2(Df ) = Pp Ip(Df ), where p ∈ Σ2(Df ), is a natural invariant associated

to f (see [2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14], and [10] for the comples case). R. Stingley [13]
proved that #Σ2(Df ) = deg(f ) · pN − pM , where deg(f ) is the topological
degree of f , and pN (resp. pM ) is the Pontryagin number of N (resp. M).
This result demonstrates that there is a non-trivial linear relation between
those two natural invariants, i.e. #Σ2(Df ) and deg(f ), associated to f .

In this paper we show how to compute #Σ2(Df ) in the case where f :
R4 → R4 is such a polynomial mapping that the family of critical points of
rank two of its complexiﬁcation is ﬁnite. Our approach does not exclude the
case where points in Σ2(Df ) are not umbilic points.

Papers [5, 12, 13] oﬀer methods of computing the index Ip(Df ) which
require the germ f : (R4, p) → (R4, f (p)) to be written in a special form.
However, if f is a polynomial then we usually are not able to ﬁnd explicitely
points in Σ2(Df ), so we cannot adopt these techniques in our case.

Let L denote the space of 4 × 4-matrices, and let Σ denote the connected
oriented 12-dimensional submanifold of L consisting of matrices of rank two.

1

As Df : R4 → L, one may deﬁne the index Ip(Df ) as the intersection number
of the mapping Df with Σ at Df (p) ∈ Σ. This is why in Sections 2,3 we
investigate a more general case of mappings m : R4 → L, and for p isolated
in m−1(Σ) we introduce the index Ip(m).

In Section 4 we explain how to verify whether m−1

form whose signature equals #Σ2(mR) = P Ip(mR), p ∈ m−1

R (Σ) is ﬁnite in the case
where mR : R4 → L is a polynomial mapping. Then we construct a quadratic
R (Σ). In the end
of this section we present examples which were calculated with the help of
Singular [4]. We also give simple examples which demonstrate that there
is only a trivial linear relation between the two natural integer invariants,
i.e. #Σ2(Df ) and deg(f ), which one may associate to a polynomial f .

It is proper to add that [3, 8] present methods for counting the signed cusp

or swallowtail singularities for polynomial selfmaps of Rn, where n = 2, 3.

2 Permutations of rows or columns

In this section we show that a 3-cyclic permutation of either rows or columns
of a 4 × 4-matrix may be prolonged to an isotopy preserving the rank of
matrices.

Let W be a vector space, and let w1, . . . , w4 ∈ W . Put w1(t) = (1 −
t)w1 + tw2, w2(t) = (1 − t)w2 + tw3, w3(t) = (1 − t)w3 + tw1, w4(t) = w4.
This way there is given an isotopy

Yi=1

W .

In particular (wi(0))4
is a 3-cyclic permutation of the ﬁrst three vectors.

i=1 = (w1, w2, w3, w4), and (wi(1))4

i=1 = (w2, w3, w1, w4)

By the rank of a sequence of vectors we shall denote the dimension of the

subspace spanned by these vectors.
Lemma 2.1. rank (wi)4
0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

i=1 = 4 if and only if rank (wi(t))4

i=1 = 4 for all

Proof. As (1 − t)3 + t3 > 0 for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, then the exterior product

w1(t) ∧ w2(t) ∧ w3(t) ∧ w4(t) = (1 − t)3w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 ∧ w4 + t3w2 ∧ w3 ∧ w1 ∧ w4

= ((1 − t)3 + t3)w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 ∧ w4
does not vanish if and only if w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 ∧ w4 6= 0. (cid:3)

2

Lemma 2.2. rank (wi)4
0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

i=1 ≥ 3 if and only if rank (wi(t))4

i=1 ≥ 3 for all

Proof. It is enough to prove (⇒). If w1, w2, w3 are linearly independent then
w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 6= 0, and so

w1(t) ∧ w2(t) ∧ w3(t) = ((1 − t)3 + t3)w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w3 6= 0

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

If w1, w2, w3 are linearly dependent, then at least one of the products

w1 ∧ w2 ∧ w4, w1 ∧ w3 ∧ w4, w2 ∧ w3 ∧ w4 is non-zero. We have

w1(t) ∧ w2(t) ∧ w4
w1(t) ∧ w3(t) ∧ w4
w2(t) ∧ w3(t) ∧ w4


 .

The determinant of the above matrix equals ((1 − t)3 + t3)2, so it does not
vanish in [0, 1]. Hence, for any 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, at least one of the products
wi(t) ∧ wj(t) ∧ w4 does not vanish, and then rank(wi(t))4

i=1 ≥ 3. (cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. rank (wi)4
0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

i=1 ≥ 2 if and only if rank (wi(t))4

i=1 ≥ 2 for all

Proof. Assume ﬁrst that rank(w1, w2, w3) ≥ 2. Then at least one of the
products w1 ∧ w2, w1 ∧ w3, w2 ∧ w3 is non-zero. We have

w1(t) ∧ w2(t)
w1(t) ∧ w3(t)
w2(t) ∧ w3(t)

By the same arguments as in Lemma 2.2, rank(w1(t), w2(t), w3(t)) ≥ 2 for
all 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

If rank(w1, w2, w3) ≤ 1, then at least one of the products w1 ∧w4, w2 ∧w4,

w3 ∧ w4 is non-zero. We have

w1(t) ∧ w4
w2(t) ∧ w4
w3(t) ∧ w4

The determinant of the above matrix equals (1 − t)3 + t3. Hence for any
0 ≤ t ≤ 1 at least one of the products wi(t) ∧ w4 does not vanish, and then
rank(wi(t))4

i=1 ≥ 2. (cid:3)

Lemma 2.4. rank (wi)4
0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

i=1 ≥ 1 if and only if rank (wi(t))4

Proof. If w4 6= 0 then the assertion is obvious. Suppose that at least one
wi 6= 0, where 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Then

and we may apply the same arguments as in the previous lemma. (cid:3)

Corollary 2.5. Obviously, if rank (wi(t))4
rank (wi)4
for each 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

i=1 ≥ k. Hence rank (wi)4

i=1 = k if and only if rank (wi(t))4

i=1 ≥ k for at least one t, then
i=1 = k

i=1 | wi ∈ R4},
i=1 denotes either rows or columns of M. We get

R4 = {(wi)4

Corollary 2.6. Let τ : L → L be a composition of ﬁnite sequence of 3-
cyclic permutations of either rows or columns. (It is worth to notice that a
permutation consisting of two disjoint transpositions is a composition of a
ﬁnite sequence of 3-cyclic permutations.) Then there exists an isotopy T :
L×[0, 1] → L such that T (M, 0) ≡ M, T (M, 1) = τ (M), and rank T (M, t) ≡
rank M.

3 Index of a critical point

In this section we investigate the intersection number of a germ (R4, p) →
L with the submanifold consisting of matrices of rank two, and then we
introduce the index of a critical point of rank two.

4

Denote by U± the open connected subsets of L consisting of matrices with
± det(A) > 0, and let U = U+ ∪ U−. Put Σ = {M ∈ L | rank(M) = 2}.
By [6, Proposition 2.5.3], a matrix M ∈ U has rank two if and only if
D − CA−1B = 0. Then Σ ∩ U is the graph of the function D = CA−1B,
so that dim Σ ∩ U = 12, codim Σ ∩ U = 4. There is also given the natural
orientation of the normal bundle over Σ ∩ U+ induced by the orientation of
coordinates (d11, d12, d21, d22) in the source of this function.

Let Mij, where 3 ≤ i, j ≤ 4, denote the minor obtained by removing the

i-th row and the j-th column from M. One may check that

det(A) · (D − CA−1B) = (cid:20) M44 M43

M34 M33 (cid:21) ,

so that Σ ∩ U = T M −1

ij (0) ∩ U. Moreover

∂(M44, M43, M34, M33)

∂(d11, d12, d21, d22)

= (det(A))4

is positive on U. In the further part of this paper we will need

Lemma 3.1. Let M ′ denote the matrix obtained by interchanging the ﬁrst
row of M ∈ U+ with the second one, and the third row with the fourth one,
so that M ′ ∈ U−. Let M ′
ij denote the minor obtained by removing the i-th
row and the j-th column from M ′. Then

and the determinant of the above 4 × 4-matrix equals +1. (cid:3)

Lemma 3.2. Let R denote the localization of the ring of polynomials on L
by the powers of det(A). Then the ideal in R generated by all 3 × 3-minors
of M equals by the one generated by Mij, where 3 ≤ i, j ≤ 4.

Proof. Applying elementary operations on rows and collumns, one may trans-
form the matrix M to the form

By the Cauchy-Binet formula, the ideal in R generated by all 3 × 3-minors
of M is equal to the one generated by all 3 × 3-minors of M ′′, i.e. by all Mij
and all aij · (M33M44 − M34M43)/ det(A)2. As det(A) is invertible in R, the
last ideal is generated by all Mij. (cid:3)

It is well-known that Σ is a connected submanifold of L of codimension
4. According to [1, Proposition 4.1], the manifold Σ, as well as its normal
bundle, is orientable. Let ﬁx the global orientation of of the normal bundle
over Σ which coincides with the orientation of the normal bundle over Σ∩U+
introduced before.

Deﬁnition. Let V be an open neighbourhood of p ∈ R4, and let m : V → L
be a continuous mapping such that p is isolated in m−1(Σ). We deﬁne the
index Ip(m) as the intersection number of m with Σ at m(p). In particular,
if m(p) ∈ Σ ∩ U+ then Ip(m) is the local topological degree of the map-
ping (R4, p) ∋ x 7→ H(x) = (h44(x), h43(x), h34(x), h33(x)) ∈ (R4, 0), where
hij(x) = Mij(m(x)). By Corollary 2.6 and Lemma 3.1, if m(p) ∈ Σ ∩ U−,
then Ip(m) equals the local topological degree of the same mapping. If p = 0
is the origin in R4, we shall denote its index by I(m).

In the remainder of this section and in the next one we shall assume that

p = 0 is isolated in m−1(Σ).

Of course, if there is a continuous family of mappings mt : V → L, where

t ∈ [0, 1], such that mt(x) ∈ Σ if and only if x = 0, then I(m0) = I(m1).

Proposition 3.3. Assume that τ : L → L is a composition of a ﬁnite
sequence of 3-cyclic permutations of rows or columns such that τ (m(0)) ∈
Σ ∩ U. Then I(m) = I(τ ◦ m).

Proof. We may assume that m−1(Σ) ∩ V = {0}. Take such an isotopy
T : L × [0, 1] → L as in Corollary 2.6. Put mt(x) = T (m(x), t). Then
m0 = T (m, 0) = m, m1 = T (m, 1) = τ ◦ m, so that m1(0) ∈ Σ ∩ U. Moreover
mt(x) ∈ Σ if and only if x = 0. Hence I(m) = I(m1) = I(τ ◦ m). (cid:3)

Since the local topological degree deg0(H) = +1, we have I(m) = +1.

4 Polynomial mappings

Let K denote either R or C. For p ∈ K4, let OK,p denote the ring of germs
at p of analytic functions (K4, p) → K, and let K[x] = K[x1, . . . , x4]. Let
LC denote the space of 4 × 4-matrices having complex entries, and let ΣC =
{M ∈ LC | rank (M) = 2}.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that matrices M1, . . . , Ms belong to ΣC. There exists
an open dense subset ∆ ⊂ L × L such that for any (L1, L2) ∈ ∆ and each
1 ≤ i ≤ s, the leading principal minor of L1 · Mi · L2 of order 2 does not
vanish.

7

Proof. For M ∈ LC, let a(M) denote its leading principal minor of order 2.
Then a : LC → C is a polynomial mapping.

Each matrix Mi is of rank 2, so that at least one of its 2 × 2-minors does
not vanish. There exists (Li
2) ∈ L × L, which represents the appropri-
ate interchange of rows and columns, such that a(Li
2) 6= 0. Then
∆i = {(L1, L2) ∈ L × L | a(L1 · Mi · L2) 6= 0} is a non-empty Zarisky open

1 · Mi · Li

1, Li

subset of L × L. The set ∆ = Ts

1 ∆i satisﬁes the assertion. (cid:3)

Let

mR(x) = (cid:20) A(x) B(x)

C(x) D(x) (cid:21) : R4 → L

be a polynomial mapping, and let mC : C4 → LC be its complexiﬁcation. Let
HK = (h44, h43, h34, h33) : K4 → K4, where hij(x) = Mij(mK(x)).

Denote by SK the ideal in K[x] generated by all 3 × 3-minors of mK(x).
Set AK = K[x]/SK. For p ∈ V (SK), denote AK,p = OK,p/SK. From now on
we shall assume that that dimR AR = dimC AC < ∞. Then the set V (SK) of
zeros of SK in K4, which equals {p ∈ K4 | rank(mK(p)) ≤ 2}, is ﬁnite.

Let PK ⊂ K[x] denote the ideal generated by all 2 × 2-minors of mK(x).
From now on we shall assume that PK = K[x], so that rank(mK(p)) ≥ 2 at
any p ∈ K4 and then V (SK) = {p ∈ K4 | rank(mK(p)) = 2}.

in m−1

In particular, if p ∈ V (SR) (resp. p ∈ V (SC)) then p is isolated in m−1

R (Σ)
(resp.
C (ΣC)). Hence, for p ∈ V (SR) the intersection index Ip(mR) is
deﬁned, and is equal to the local topological degree degp(HR) : (R4, p) →
(R4, 0).

Deﬁnition. Set #Σ2(mR) = P Ip(mR), where p ∈ V (SR) = m−1

R (Σ).

Be Lemma 4.1, after R-linear changes of coordinates in Cn if necessary,
one may expect det(A) not to vanish at every p ∈ V (SK), so that the ideal
in K[x] generated by SK and det(A) equals K[x]. This justiﬁes assumptions
of the next lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Assume that the ideal generated by SK and det(A) equals K[x].
Then

(i) det(A(p)) 6= 0 at each p ∈ V (SK),

8

(ii) at each p ∈ V (SK), the ideal in OK,p generated by SK equals the one

generated by h44, h43, h34, h33.

Proof. Assertion (i) is obvious. If p ∈ V (SK) then det(A(p)) 6= 0. By Lemma
3.2, the ideal in OK,p generated by SK, i.e. by all 3 × 3-minors of mK(x), is
in fact generated by Mij(mK(x)) = hij(x), where 3 ≤ i, j ≤ 4. (cid:3)

Assertion (ii) of the above lemma allows us to compute #Σ2(mR) by
applying arguments developed in [7, Section 3]. We shall now recall brieﬂy
the method presented there.

Let V (SC) = {p1, . . . , pr}. The complex conjugation on V (SC) ﬁxes
V (SR), so one may assume that V (SR) = {p1, . . . , pm} and V (SC) \ V (SR)
is the union of pairs of conjugate points {pm+1, pm+1, . . . , pw, pw}, where
w = (r − m)/2. Put h1 = h44, h2 = h43, h3 = h34, h4 = h33.

For x = (x1, . . . , x4), x′ = (x′

1, . . . , x′

4), and 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 4 deﬁne

Tij(x, x′) =

hi(x′

1, . . . , xj, . . . , x4) − hi(x′

1, . . . , x′

j, . . . , x4)

xj − x′
j

.

It is easy to see that each Tij extends to a polynomial, thus we may assume
that Tij ∈ R[x, x′] = R[x1, . . . , x4, x′
4]. There is the natural projection
R[x, x′] −→ AR ⊗ AR given by

1, . . . , x′

4)β4 7→ xα1

1 · · · xα4

1)β1 · · · (x′

4)β4.

Let T denote the image of det[Tij(x, x′)] in AR ⊗ AR.

Put d = dimR AR. Assume that e1, . . . , ed form a basis in AR. So

dimR AR ⊗ AR = d2 and ei ⊗ ej, for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ d,

form a basis in AR ⊗ AR. Hence there are tij ∈ R such that

T =

d

Xi,j=1

tijei ⊗ ej =

Xi=1

ei ⊗ ˆei,

where ˆei = Pd

j=1 tijej. Elements ˆe1, . . . , ˆed form a basis in AR. So there are

A1, . . . , Ad ∈ R such that 1 = A1ˆe1 + . . . + Adˆed in AR.

Deﬁnition. For a = a1e1 +. . .+aded ∈ AR deﬁne ϕT (a) = a1A1 +. . .+adAd.
Hence ϕT : AR −→ R is a linear functional. Let ΦT be the bilinear form on
AR given by ΦT (a, b) = ϕT (ab).

Theorem 4.4. Suppose that dimR AR < ∞ and the ideal generated by SR
and det(A) equals R[x]. Then

Proof. It is enough to observe that #Σ2(mR) = Pm

Example. Let f = (x−2y2 + zw, y −x2w + 4z3, zw + 3w + x2, xz + yw −4y) :
R4 → R4, and mR = Df . Using Singular [4] and computer programs writ-
ten by Adriana Gorzelak and Magdalena Sarnowska - students of computer
sciences at the Gdańsk University - one may verify that dimR AR = 34, other
assumptions of the above theorem hold, and signature(ΦT ) = 2, so that
#Σ2(Df ) = 2.

Example. Let f = (x − z3, y − xzw, x3 − yz + yw, x2 + y2 + zw) : R4 → R4,
and mR = Df . One may verify that dimR AR = 23, other assumptions of the
above theorem hold, and signature(ΦT ) = 1, so that #Σ2(Df ) = 1. More-
over rank(Df (0)) = 2, I0(Df ) = −1 and dimR AR,0 = 3, so that the origin
is not an umbilic point.

If f : R4 → R4 is a proper polynomial mapping, there exists R > 0 such
that |x| < R for each x ∈ f −1(0). Denote by deg(f ) the topological degree
of S 3

R ∋ x 7→ f (x)/|f (x)| ∈ S 3.

Example. Let g± = (x, y, z2 + w2 ± xz + yw, ±zw). Both g± are proper and
(Dg±)−1(Σ) = g−1

y, ±w, ±z) = ∓1. Moreover, deg(g±) = deg0(g±) = 0.

The above examples demonstrate that there is only a trival linear relation
of the form A #Σ2(Df ) + B deg(f ) + C = 0 for mappings f : R4 → R4,
contrary to the case of mappings M → N, where M is closed (see [13]).
