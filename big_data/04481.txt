FLAVORS OF TRANSLATIVE COVERINGS

M ´ARTON NASZ ´ODI

Abstract. We survey results on the problem of covering the
space Rn, or a convex body in it, by translates of a convex body.
Our main goal is to present a diverse set of methods. A theorem of
Rogers is a central result, according to which, for any convex body
K, the space Rn can be covered by translates of K with density
around n ln n. We outline four approaches to proving this result.
Then, we discuss the illumination conjecture, decomposability of
multiple coverings, Sudakov’s inequality and some problems con-
cerning coverings by sequences of sets.

1. Introduction

The problem of covering a set by few translates of another appears
naturally in several contexts. In computational applications it may be
used for divide and conquer algorithms, in analysis, it yields ε–nets,
in functional analysis, it is used to quantify how compact an operator
between Banach spaces is.
In geometry, it is simply an interesting
question on its own.

Our primary focus is to describe a representative family of meth-
ods, rather than giving a complete account of the state of the art.
In particular, we highlight some combinatorial ideas, and sketch some
instructive probabilistic computations.

We minimize overlap with the fundamental works of L. Fejes T´oth
[Fej53] and Rogers [Rog64]. B¨or¨oczky’s book [B¨or04] is the most recent
source on ﬁnite coverings. Some of the topics covered here are discussed
in more detail in the books [PA95, Bez10, Mat02, BMP05]. Many of the
topics omitted, or only touched upon here (most notably, planar and
three–dimensional results, lattice coverings and density) are discussed
in the surveys [Fej04, Fej99, FK93b, FK93a, Fej83] by G. Fejes T´oth.

In Section 3, we state Rogers’ result, and a few of its relatives, on the
existence of an economical covering of the whole space by translates of
an arbitrary convex body. In Section 4, we outline three probabilistic
proofs of these results. In Section 5, we describe a fourth approach,

which is based on an algorithmic (non–probabilistic) result from com-
binatorics. Then, in Section 6, we discuss the problem of illumination.
There, we sketch the proof of a result of Schramm, which is currently
the best general upper bound for Borsuk’s problem. In Section 7, we
state some of the most recent results on the problem of decomposability
of multiple coverings. Section 8 provides a window to how the asymp-
totic theory of convex bodies views translative coverings. Finally, in
Section 9, we consider coverings by sequences of convex bodies.

We use the following notations, and terminology. For two Borel
measurable sets K and L in Rn, let N(K, L) denote the translative
covering number of K by L, that is, the minimum number of translates
of L that cover K.

The Euclidean ball of radius one centered at the origin is Bn

2 = {x ∈
Rn :
|x|2 =< x, x >≤ 1}, where < ., . > denotes the standard scalar
product on Rn. We denote the Haar probability measure on the sphere
Sn−1 = {x ∈ Rn : |x| = 1} by σ.
A symmetric convex body is a convex body (that is, a compact convex
set with non–empty interior) that is centrally symmetric about some
point. A hyperplane H supports a convex set K, if H intersects the
boundary of K, and K is contained in one of the closed half–spaces
bounded by H. The support function hK of a convex set K is deﬁned
as hK(x) = sup{< x, k > : k ∈ K} for any x ∈ Rn. We denote the
polar of a convex body K by

K∗ = {x ∈ Rn : < x, k >≤ 1 for all k ∈ K}.

The cardinality of a set X is denoted by |X|.

2. Basics

We list a number of simple properties of covering numbers, their

proofs are quite straight forward, cf.[AAGM15].
Fact 2.1. Let K, L, M be convex sets in Rn, T : Rn → Rn an invertible
linear transformation. The we have

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

N(K, L) = N(T (K), T (L)),
N(K, L) ≤ N(K, M)N(M, L),

N(K + M, L + M) ≤ N(K, L),

N(K, 2(K ∩ L)) ≤ N(K, L), if K = −K.

We note a special property of the Euclidean ball as a covering set.

Fact 2.2. Let K be a convex set in Rn. If K is covered by t Euclidean
balls, then K is covered by t Euclidean balls with centers in K.

This fact follows from the observation that the intersection of Bn
2
with a half-space not containing the origin is contained in the unit ball

FLAVORS OF TRANSLATIVE COVERINGS

centered at the orthogonal projection of the origin to the bounding
hyperplane of the half-space.

The following obvious lower bound is often suﬃcient:

(5)

N(K, L) ≥

vol(L)
vol(K)

.

For an upper bound, assume that L is symmetric. Let X + (L/2)
be a saturated packing of translates of L/2 in K + (L/2), that is a
maximal family of translates of L/2 with pairwise disjoint interiors.
Then K ⊆ X + L, that is, we have a covering of K by |X| translates
of L. Thus,

(6)

N(K, L) ≤ |X| ≤ 2n vol(K + (L/2))

vol(L)

, if L = −L.

Section 3, and a large part of this paper discuss how this bound can

be improved.

3. Covering the whole space

Let K be a convex body, Λ a lattice, and T a ﬁnite set in Rn. We
call the family F = K + Λ + T = {K + v + t
: v ∈ Λ, t ∈ T} a
periodic arrangement of translates of K. The density of F is deﬁned
as δ(F ) = |T| vol(K)/ det Λ. We say that F is a covering of Rn if
∪F = Rn. The periodic translative covering density θ(K) of K is the
inﬁmum of the densities of periodic coverings of Rn by translates of K.
The ﬁrst milestone in the theory of translative coverings is the fol-

lowing theorem of Rogers.

Theorem 3.1 (Rogers, [Rog57]). Let K be a bounded convex set in Rn
with non-empty interior. Then the periodic translative covering density
of K is at most

(7)

θ(K) ≤ n ln n + n ln ln n + 5n.

One can deﬁne the translative covering density in general, for non-
periodic arrangements as well (cf. [Fej53, Rog64, PA95, B¨or04]). How-
ever –perhaps, not surprisingly–, no better bound is known in this case.
Earlier, exponential upper bounds for the covering density were ob-
tained by Rogers, Bambah and Roth, and for the special case of the
Euclidean ball by Davenport and Watson (cf. [Rog57] for references).
The last summand, 5n may be replaced by 3n, if n is suﬃciently large.
The current best bound on θ(K) is due to G. Fejes T´oth [Fej09], who
replaced 5n by n + o(n) (see Theorem 3.4).
It is an open problem
whether one can improve the bound by a multiplicative factor bellow
1, or, very ambitiously, if Cn is an upper bound, for some universal
C > 0.

It is natural to ask what happens if the density is replaced by the

maximum multiplicity.

4

M. NASZ ´ODI

Theorem 3.2 (Erd˝os, Rogers, [ER61]). For any convex body K in Rn
there is a periodic covering of Rn by translates of K such that no point
is covered by more than e(n ln n + n ln ln n + 4n) translates, and the
density is below n ln n + n ln ln n + 4n, provided n is large enough.

A good candidate for a “bad” convex body, that is, one that cannot

cover the space economically is the Euclidean ball, Bn
2 .
Theorem 3.3 (Coxeter, Few, Rogers, [CFR59]). θ(Bn
2 ) ≥ Cn with a
universal constant C > 0.

If we restrict ourselves to lattice coverings, that is, coverings of Rn
by translates of a convex body K where the translation vectors form a
lattice in Rn, we have a much weaker bound. Rogers [Rog59] showed
that for any K there is a lattice Λ such that K + Λ is a covering of Rn
with density at most nlog2 ln n+O(1).

The original proofs of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 yield periodic coverings
without any further structure. G. Fejes T´oth gave a proof of Theo-
rem 3.1 that yields a covering with more of a lattice–like structure,
and a slightly better density bound.

Theorem 3.4 (G. Fejes T´oth, [Fej09]). For any convex body K in Rn
there is a lattice Λ and a set T ⊂ Rn of O(ln n) translation vectors such
that K +Λ+T covers Rn with density at most n ln n+n ln ln n+n+o(n).

We give an outline of the proof of this result in 4.3.
The following is a simple corollary to Theorem 3.1 (or the better

bound, Theorem 3.4), which was ﬁrst spelled out in [RZ97].

Corollary 3.5 (Rogers and Zong [RZ97]). Let K and L be convex
bodies in Rn. Then

(8)

N(K, L) ≤

vol(K − L)

vol(L)

(n ln n + n ln ln n + n + o(n)).

Indeed, consider a covering L + G of a large cube C by translates of
L with density close to n ln n + n ln ln n + n + o(n). For any t ∈ Rn,
let m(t) = |{g ∈ G : K ∩ (g + t + L) 6= ∅}| = |G ∩ (K − L − t)|. By
averaging m(t) over t in C, we obtain that for some t ∈ C, we have
m(t) ≤ vol(K−L)

vol(L) (n ln n + n ln ln n + n + o(n) + ε).

4. Proofs of Theorems 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4

4.1. A probabilistic proof: Cover randomly and then mind the
gap. We give an outline of Rogers’ proof of Theorem 3.1.

We may assume that K has volume one, and that the centroid (that
is, the center of mass with respect to the Lebesgue measure) of K is the
origin. It follows that K ⊂ −nK. (Bonnesen and Fenchel in §34. of
[BF87] give several references to this fact: Minkowski [Min97] p. 105,
Radon [Rad16], Estermann [Est28] and S¨uss [S¨us28].)

FLAVORS OF TRANSLATIVE COVERINGS

Let C be the cube C = [0, R]n, where R is large. Set η = 1

n ln n ,
and choose N = Rnn ln 1
η random translation vectors x1, . . . , xN in C
uniformly and independently. Let Λ be the lattice Λ = RZn. Thus,
we obtain the family K + Λ + {x1, . . . , xN} of translates of K. The
expected density of the union of this family is close to one, and hence,
one can choose the N translation vectors in such a way that the volume
of the uncovered part of C is small (at most Rn(1 − R−n)N ).
Next, we take a saturated (that is, maximal) packing y1− 1
n K, . . . yM−
n K of translates of − 1
n K inside this uncovered part of C. By the pre-
vious volume computation, we have few (M ≤ η−nRn(1− R−n)N ) such
translates. We replace each of these copies of − 1
n K by the same trans-
late of K and make it a periodic arrangement by Λ, and we obtain
K + Λ + {y1, . . . , yM}.
Now, we have two families of translates of K. We enlarge each
member of these two families by a factor 1 + η, and –as it is easy
to see– obtain a covering of Rn. The omitted computations yield the
density bound, ﬁnishing the proof of Theorem 3.1.

This method (ﬁrst, picking random copies, and then, ﬁlling the small
gap in a greedy way), developed by Rogers can be applied for obtaining
upper bounds in other situations as well. The proof of Theorem 3.2
given by Erd˝os and Rogers is an example of the use of this random
covering technique combined with a sophisticated way of keeping track
of multiply covered points using an inclusion–exclusion formula. Other
examples include bounds on covering the sphere Sn−1 with spherical
caps.

4.2. Another probabilistic proof: Using the Lov´asz Local Lem-
ma. F¨uredi and Kang [FK08] gave a proof of Theorem 3.2 that is
essentially diﬀerent from the original. Their method yields a slightly
worse bound (instead of the order en ln n, they obtain 10n ln n), but it
is very elegant.

e Bn

First, we may assume that K is in a nice position, more precisely
(by a result of Ball [Bal91], see also [Bal89] for the symmetric case),
2 ⊂ K. Let h = 1/(4en√n), and consider the
that vol(K) = 1, and 1
lattice Λ = hZn. The goal is to cover Rn with translates of K of the
form K + z with z ∈ Λ. Let Q = [0, h)n be the half closed, half open
fundamental cube of Λ. We deﬁne a hypergraph with base set Λ. The
hypergraph has two types of edges. For any z ∈ Λ, we deﬁne a “small
edge” as A−(z) := {y ∈ Λ : y + Q ⊂ z + K}, and a “big edge” as
A+(z) := {y ∈ Λ :
(y + Q) ∩ (z + K) 6= ∅}. Clearly, all big edges
are of the same size (say α), and so are all small edges. One can verify
that the size of a small edge is at least α/2.

Next, to make the problem ﬁnite, let ℓ ∈ Z+ be an arbitrarily large
integer. Our goal is to select vectors z1, . . . , zt ∈ Λ in such a way that
every point of [−ℓ, ℓ]n ∩ Λ is covered by a small edge A−(zi), and no

6

M. NASZ ´ODI

point of [−ℓ, ℓ]n ∩ Λ is covered by more than 10n ln n large edges of
the form A+(zi). Clearly, that would suﬃce for proving the theorem.
We will pick these vectors randomly: select each vector in {z ∈ Λ :
A−(z) ∩ [−ℓ, ℓ]n 6= ∅} with probability p, where p = e−6/510n ln n/α.
For every point of [−ℓ, ℓ]n∩ Λ, we have two kinds of bad events. One
is if it is not covered by a small edge, and second, if it is covered by too
many big edges. Now, we state the main tool of the proof, the Lov´asz
Local Lemma (see Alon and Spencer [AS08] for a good introduction of
it).

Lemma 4.1 (Lov´asz Local Lemma, [EL75,Spe77]). Let A1, A2, . . . , AN
be events in an arbitrary probability space. A directed graph D = (V, E)
on the set of vertices V = {1, 2, . . . , N} is called a dependency digraph
for the events A1, A2, . . . , AN , if for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the event Ai is
mutually independent of all the events {Aj
: (i, j) /∈ E}. Suppose that
the maximum degree of D is at most d, and that the probability of each
Ai is at most p. If ep(d + 1) ≤ 1, then with positive probability no Ai
holds.

Finally, with a geometric argument, one can bound the maximum
degree in a dependency digraph of the bad events, and Lemma 4.1
yields the existence of a good covering.

4.3. Covering using few lattices. G. Fejes T´oth’s proof of Theo-
rem 3.4 relies on a deep result, Theorem 10* in [Sch59] of Schmidt. A
consequence of this result is

Lemma 4.2. Let c0 = 0.278 . . . be the root of the equation 1+x+ln x =
0. Then, for any 0 < c < c0, and ε > 0, and any suﬃciently large n,
for any Borel set S ⊂ Rn, there is a lattice–arrangement of S with
density cn covering Rn with the exception of a set whose density is at
most (1 + ε)e−cn for some universal constant c > 0.

By this lemma, for a given K there is a lattice Λ such that (1 +
⌊n ln n⌋−1)−1K + Λ covers Rn with the exception of a set whose density
is at most e−cn+1.

Lemma 4.3. If, for some ﬁnite set T , K + Λ + T is an arrangement
of K with density 1 − δ, then there is a vector t ∈ Rn such that the
arrangement K+Λ+T ′ has density at least 1−δ2, where T ′ = T∪(T +t).
The proof of Lemma 4.3 relies on considering the density of Rn \
(K + Λ + T ′) as a function of t, and averaging it over the fundamental
domain of Λ.

To prove Theorem 3.4, we pick an appropriate c for Lemma 4.2, and
using Lemma 4.3 roughly log2(c−1 ln n) times, we obtain a ﬁnite set T
of size about c−1 ln n such that (1 +⌊n ln n⌋−1)−1K + Λ + T has density
about n ln n with the uncovered part being of density at most of order

FLAVORS OF TRANSLATIVE COVERINGS

(n ln n)−n. Finally, one can verify that K + Λ + T is a covering of space
with the desired density.

So far, we presented three probabilistic methods that yield economi-
cal coverings. In the next section, we present a fourth method, which is
not random. Instead, it relies on an algorithmic combinatorial result.

5. A fractional approach

5.1. A few words of combinatorics. We recall some notions from
the theory of hypergraphs.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let Λ be a set, H a family of subsets of Λ. A covering
of Λ by H is a subset of H whose union is Λ. The covering number
τ (Λ,H) of Λ by H is the minimum cardinality of its coverings by H.

A fractional covering of Λ by H is a measure µ on H with

µ({H ∈ H : p ∈ H}) ≥ 1
The fractional covering number of H is

for all p ∈ Λ.

τ∗(Λ,H) = inf {µ(H) : µ is a fractional covering of Λ by H} .
When Λ is a ﬁnite set, ﬁnding the value of τ (Λ,H) is an integer
programming problem. Indeed, we assign a variable xH to each member
H of H, and set xH to 1 if H is in the covering, and 0 otherwise. Each
element p of Λ yields an inequality: Pp∈H∈H
Computing τ∗(Λ,H) is the linear relaxation of the above integer pro-
gramming problem. For more on (fractional) coverings, cf. [F¨ur88] in
the abstract (combinatorial) setting and [PA95,Mat02] in the geometric
setting.

xH ≥ 1.

The gap between τ and τ∗ is bounded in the case of ﬁnite set
families (hypergraphs) by the following result of Lov´asz [Lov75] and
Stein[Ste74].
Lemma 5.2 (Lov´asz [Lov75], Stein[Ste74]). For any ﬁnite Λ and H ⊆
2Λ we have

(9)

τ (Λ,H) < (1 + ln(max

H∈H |H|))τ∗(Λ,H).

Furthermore, the greedy algorithm (always picking the set that covers
the largest number of uncovered points) yields a covering of cardinality
less than the right hand side in (9).

We note that a probabilistic argument yields a slightly diﬀerent

bound on the covering number:

(10)

τ (Λ,H) ≤$1 +

% ,

ln|Λ|
− ln(cid:0)1 − 1
τ ∗(cid:1)

with the notation τ∗ = τ∗(Λ,H). When we do not have an upper
bound on maxH∈H |H| better than |Λ|, then (10) is a bit better than
(9).

8

M. NASZ ´ODI

To prove (10), let µ be fractional covering of Λ by H such that
µ(H) = τ∗ + ε, where ε > 0 is very small. We normalize µ to obtain
the probability measure ν = µ/µ(H) on H. Let m denote the right
hand side in (10), and pick m members of H randomly according to ν.
Then we have

P (∃u ∈ Λ : u is not covered) ≤ |Λ|(cid:18)1 −

1

τ∗ + ε(cid:19)m

< 1.

Thus, with positive probability, we have a covering.

We will need the duals of these notions as well. Let Λ be a set
and H be a family of subsets of Λ. The dual of this set family is
another set family, whose base set is H, and the set family on H is
H∗ =(cid:8){H ∈ H : p ∈ H} : p ∈ Λ(cid:9).
We call a set T ⊂ Λ a transversal to the set family H, if T inter-
sects each member of H. One may deﬁne fractional transversals in the
obvious way, and then deﬁne the (fractional) transversal number.
Clearly G ⊂ H is a covering of Λ if and only if, G is a transversal to
H∗. Fractional coverings and fractional transversals are dual notions
in the same manner. We leave it as an exercise (which will be needed
later) to formulate the dual of Lemma 5.2 and of (10).

5.2. The fractional covering number. Motivated by the above com-
binatorial notions, the fractional version of N(K, int K) (which is the
illuminaton number of K, see Section 6) ﬁrst appeared in [Nas09], and
in general for N(K, L) in [AAR11] and [AAS13].

Deﬁnition 5.3. Let K and L be bounded Borel measurable sets in
Rn. A fractional covering of K by translates of L is a Borel measure µ
on Rn with µ(x− L) ≥ 1 for all x ∈ K. The fractional covering number
of K by translates of L is

N∗(K, L) =

inf {µ(Rn) : µ is a fractional covering of K by translates of L} .
Clearly,

(11)

N∗(K, L) ≤ N(K, L).

In Deﬁnition 5.3 we may assume that a fractional cover µ is sup-
ported on cl(K − L). According to Theorem 1.7 of [AAS13], we have
(12)

vol(K − L)

.

max(cid:26) vol(K)

vol(L)

, 1(cid:27) ≤ N∗(K, L) ≤

The second inequality is easy to see: the Lebesgue measure restricted
to K − L with the following scaling µ = vol / vol(L) is a fractional
covering of K by translates of L. To prove the ﬁrst inequality, assume
that µ is a fractional covering of K by translates of L. Then

vol(L)

vol(L)µ(Rn) =ZRn

vol(L)dµ(x) =ZRnZRn

χL(y − x)dydµ(x) =

FLAVORS OF TRANSLATIVE COVERINGS

ZRnZRn

χL(y − x)dµ(x)dy =ZRn

µ(y − L)dy ≥ZRn

χK(y)dy = vol(K).

We recall from 5.1 that computing N means solving an integer pro-
gramming problem (though, in this situation, with inﬁnitely many vari-
ables), and computing N∗ is its linear relaxation. The linear relaxation
is usually easier to solve, so having an inequality bounding N from
above by some function of N∗ is desirable.
It is open whether such
inequality exists in general for convex sets. More precisely, we do not
know if there is a function f such that for any dimension n, and any
convex bodies K and L in Rn, we have N(K, L) ≤ f (n, N∗(K, L)).
Using a probabilistic argument, Artstein–Avidan and Slomka [AAS13]
found a bound of N(K, L) in terms of N∗(K′, L′), where K′ and L′ are
almost K and L. A somewhat stronger bound was obtained in [Nas14]
by a non-probabilistic proof. For two sets K, T ⊂ Rn, we denote their
Minkowski diﬀerence by K ∼ T = {x ∈ Rn : T + x ⊆ K}.
Theorem 5.4 (Artstein–Avidan and Slomka [AAS13], Nasz´odi [Nas14]).
Let K, L and T be bounded Borel measurable sets in Rn and let Λ ⊂ Rn
be a ﬁnite set with K ⊆ Λ + T . Then
(13)

N(K, L) ≤

(1 + ln( max

x∈K−L|(x + (L ∼ T )) ∩ Λ|)) · N∗(K − T, L ∼ T ).

If Λ ⊂ K, then we have
(14)

N(K, L) ≤

(1 + ln( max

x∈K−L|(x + (L ∼ T )) ∩ Λ|)) · N∗(K, L ∼ T ).

2 = {x ∈ K : x + δBn

We sketch a proof of Theorem 5.4 in 5.3.
For a set K ⊂ Rn and δ > 0, we denote the δ-inner parallel body of
K by K−δ := K ∼ δBn
2 ⊆ K}. As an application
of Theorem 5.4, one quickly obtains the following result which, in turn,
may be used to give a simple proof of Rogers’ result, Theorem 3.1.
Theorem 5.5 (Nasz´odi [Nas14]). Let K ⊆ Rn be a bounded measurable
set. Then there is a covering of Rn by translated copies of K of density
at most

The theorem still holds if the δ-inner parallel body is deﬁned with

respect to any norm in place of the Euclidean.

5.3. Proof of Theorem 5.4. The proofs outlined so far were all prob-
abilistic in nature. In this one, the role that probability plays elsewhere
is played by the following straightforward corollary to Lemma 5.2.

10

M. NASZ ´ODI

Observation 5.6. Let Y be a set, F a family of subsets of Y , and
X ⊆ Y . Let Λ be a ﬁnite subset of Y and Λ ⊆ U ⊆ Y . Assume
that for another family F′ of subsets of Y we have τ (X,F ) ≤ τ (Λ,F′).
Then

(15)

τ (X,F ) ≤ τ (Λ,F′) ≤ (1 + ln( max

F ′∈F ′ |Λ ∩ F ′|)) · τ∗(U,F′).

The proof is simply a substitution into (15). We set Y = Rn, X = K,
F = {L + x : x ∈ K − L}, F′ = {L ∼ T + x : x ∈ K − L}. One can
use U = K − T , as any member of Λ not in K − T could be dropped
from Λ and Λ would still have the property that Λ + T ⊇ K. That
proves (13). To prove (14), we notice that in the case when Λ ⊂ K,
one can take U = K.

5.4. Detour: Covering the sphere by caps. To illustrate the ap-
plicability of the method that yields Theorem 5.4, we turn to coverings
on the sphere. We denote the closed spherical cap of spherical radius
ϕ centered at u ∈ Sn−1 by C(u, ϕ) = {v ∈ Sn−1
: < u, v >≥ cos ϕ},
and its probability measure by Ω(ϕ) = σ(C(u, ϕ)). For a set K ⊂ Sn−1
and δ > 0, we denote the δ–inner parallel body of K by K−δ = {u ∈
K : C(u, δ) ⊆ K}.
A set K ⊂ Sn−1 is called spherically convex, if it is contained in an
open hemisphere and for any two of its points, it contains the shorter
great circular arc connecting them.

The spherical circumradius of a subset of an open hemisphere of Sn−1
is the spherical radius of the smallest spherical cap (the circum-cap)
that contains the set. A proof mimicking the proof of Theorem 5.4
yields
Theorem 5.7 (Nasz´odi [Nas14]). Let K ⊆ Sn−1 be a measurable set.
Then there is a covering of Sn−1 by rotated copies of K of density at
most

Improving an earlier result of Rogers [Rog63], B¨or¨oczky and Wintsche
[BW03] showed that for any 0 < ϕ < π/2 and dimension n there is
a covering of Sn by spherical caps of radius ϕ with density at most
n ln n + n ln ln n + 5n. This result follows from Theorem 5.7. Other
bounds on covering the sphere by caps (or, a ball by smaller equal
balls) can be found in [Ver05] by Verger–Gaugry.

6. The Illumination Conjecture

We ﬁx a convex body K in Rn. Once the covering number is deﬁned,
it is fairly natural to ask what Levi [Lev55] asked: how large may
N(K, int K) be. We will call this quantity the illumination number of

K, and denote it by i(K) = N(K, int K). The naming will become
obvious in the next paragraphs.

Following Hadwiger [Had60], we say that a point p ∈ Rn \ K illumi-
nates a boundary point b ∈ bd K, if the ray {p + λ(b − p) : λ > 0}
emanating from p and passing through b intersects the interior of K.
Boltyanski [Bol60] gave the following slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition. A di-
rection u ∈ Sn−1 is said to illuminate K at a boundary point b ∈ bd K,
if the ray {b+ λu : λ > 0} intersects the interior of K. It is easy to see
that the minimum number of directions that illuminate each boundary
point of K is equal to the minimum number of points that illuminate
each boundary point of K, which in turn is equal to the illumination
number of K.

Gohberg and Markus [GM60] asked how large inf{N(K, λK : 0 <
λ < 1)} can be. It also follows easily that this number is equal to i(K).
The following dual formulation of the deﬁnition of the illumination
number was found independently by P. Soltan, V. Soltan [SS86] and
by Bezdek [Bez91]. First, recall that an exposed face of a convex body
K is the intersection of K with a supporting hyperplane. Now, let K
be a convex body in Rn containing the origin in its interior. Then i(K)
is the minimum size of a family of hyperplanes in Rn such that each
exposed face of the polar K∗ of K is strictly separated from the origin
by at least one of the hyperplanes in the family (for the deﬁnition of
K∗, see the introduction).

Any smooth convex body (ie., a convex body with a unique support
hyperplane at each boundary point) in Rn is illuminated by n + 1
directions.
Indeed, for a smooth convex body, the set of directions
illuminating a given boundary point is an open hemisphere of Sn−1,
and one can ﬁnd n + 1 points (eg., the vertices of a regular simplex) in
Sn−1 with the property that every open hemisphere contains at least
one of the points. Thus, these n + 1 points in Sn−1 (ie., directions)
illuminate any smooth convex body in Rn. It is easy to see that no
convex body is illuminated by less than n + 1 directions.

On the other hand, the illumination number of the cube is 2n, since
no two vertices of the cube share an illumination direction. An impor-
tant unsolved problem in Discrete Geometry is the Gohberg–Markus–
Levi–Boltyanski–Hadwiger Conjecture (or, Illumination Conjecture),
according to which for any convex body K in Rn, we have i(K) = 2n,
where equality is attained only when K is an aﬃne image of the cube.
In this section, we mention some results on illumination. For a more
complete account of the current state of the problem, see [Bez06,Bez10,
BMP05, MS99, Sza97]. In Chapter VI. of [BMS97], among many other
facts on illumination, one can ﬁnd a proof of the equivalence of the ﬁrst
four deﬁnitions of i(K) given at the beginning of this section. Quan-
titative versions of the illumination number are discussed in Chapter
[Refernce to Bezdek–Kahn chapter] of this volume.

One detail of the history of the conjecture may tell a lot about
it.
It was asked several times in diﬀerent formulations (see the dif-
ferent deﬁnitions of i(K) above), ﬁrst in 1960 (though, Levi’s study
of N(K, int K) on the plane is from 1955). Several partial results ap-
peared solving the conjecture for special families of convex bodies. Yet,
the best general bound is an immediate consequence of Rogers’ The-
orem 3.1 (more precisely, Corollary 3.5) from 1957 combined with the
Rogers–Shepard inequality [RS57], according to which vol(K − K) ≤
(cid:0)2n
n(cid:1) vol(K) for any convex body K in Rn.
i(K) ≤(2n(n ln n + n ln ln n + 5n)
(cid:0)2n
n(cid:1)(n ln n + n ln ln n + 5n)

Theorem 6.1 (Rogers [Rog57]). Let K be a convex body in Rn. Then

if K = −K,
otherwise.

By [Lev55], the Illumination Conjecture holds on the plane. Papad-
operakis [Pap99] proved i(K) ≤ 16 in dimension three. The upper
bound in the conjecture (that is, not the equality case) was veriﬁed
in the following cases: if K = −K ⊂ R3 (Lassak [Las84]), if K ⊂ R3
is a convex polyhedron with at least one non-trivial aﬃne symmetry
(Bezdek [Bez91]), if K ⊂ R3 is symmetric about a plane (Dekster
[Dek00]).

6.1. Borsuk’s problem and illuminating sets of constant width.
The problem of illumination is closely related to another classical ques-
tion in geometry. Borsuk’s problem [Bor33] (or, Borsuk’s Conjecture,
though, he formulated it as a question) asks whether every bounded
set X in Rn can be partitioned into n + 1 sets of diameter less than the
diameter of X (cf. [Rai08] for a comprehensive survey). The minimum
number of such parts is the Borsuk number of X, and clearly, it is at
most the illumination number of conv(X). Since any bounded set in Rn
is contained in a set of constant width of the same diameter, it follows
that any upper bound on the illumination number of sets of constant
width in a certain dimension is also a bound on the maximum Borsuk
number in the same dimension.

The aﬃrmative answer to Borsuk’s problem in the plane was proved
by Borsuk, then, in three–space by Perkal [Per47] and Eggleston [Egg55]
(in the case of ﬁnite, three-dimensional sets, see Gr¨unbaum [Gr¨u57],
Heppes–R´ev´esz [HR56] and Heppes [Hep57]).
It was ﬁrst shown by
Lassak [Las97] (see also [Wei96, BLNP07]) that sets of constant width
in R3 can be illuminated by three pairs of opposite directions. It would
be a nice alternative proof of the bound 4 on the Borsuk number in
three–space, if one could show that three–dimensional sets of constant
width have illumination number 4 (see Conjecture 3.3.5. in [Bez10]).

In 1993 by an ingenious proof, Kahn and Kalai [KK93] (based on a
deep combinatorial result of Frankl and Wilson [FW81]) showed that if
n is large enough, then there is a ﬁnite set in Rn whose Borsuk number is

FLAVORS OF TRANSLATIVE COVERINGS

13

greater than (1.2)√n, thus answering Borsuk’s question in the negative.
That result made the following bound on the illumination number by
Schramm [Sch88] all the more relevant. Currently, this is also the best
general bound for the Borsuk number.

Theorem 6.2 (Schramm [Sch88]). In any dimension n for any set W
of constant width in Rn, we have

i(W ) ≤ 5n√n(4 + ln n)(cid:18)3

2(cid:19)n/2

.

By a ﬁne analysis of Schramm’s method, Bezdek (Theorem 6.8.3. of
[Bez10]) extended Theorem 6.2 to the class of those convex bodies W
that can be obtained as W = ∩x∈X(x + Bn
2 ) for some X ⊂ Rn compact
set with diam X ≤ 1. Note that a set W is of constant width one if
and only if, W = ∩x∈W (x + Bn
2 ).
We sketch the proof. First, we give yet another way to compute
the illumination number of a convex body K. Let b be a boundary
point of K, and consider its Gauss image β(b) ⊂ Sn−1 consisting of the
inner unit normal vectors of all hyperplanes supporting K at b. It is a
closed, spherically convex set. We denote the open polar of a subset of
the sphere F ⊂ Sn−1 by F + = {u ∈ Sn−1 : < u, f >> 0 for all f ∈ F}.
Consider the set family F = {(β(b))+ :
b ∈ bd K}. Clearly, the
directions u1, . . . , um ∈ Sn−1 illuminate K if and only if, each member
of F contains at least one ui. In other words, we are looking for a small
cardinality transversal to the set family F (for deﬁnitions, see 5.1). We
note that the idea of considering the Gauss image and F to bound the
illumination number also appears in [Bez91, BLNP07, BK09].
2 ) with a compact set X ⊂ Rn of
diameter at most one. To make the problem of bounding i(W ) ﬁnite,
we take a covering of Sn−1 by spherical caps of Euclidean diameter
ε := q 2n
2n−1 − 1, say C1 ∪ . . . ∪ CN = Sn−1. Such covering exists with
N ≤ (1 + 4
ε )n by the simple bound (6). We could use a better bound,
but that would not yield any visible improvement on the bound on
i(W ). Let

Now, consider a set W = ∩x∈X (x+Bn

β(b),

Ui := [β(b)∩Ci6=∅
and consider the set family G = {U +
i = 1, . . . , N}. Clearly, any
transversal to the ﬁnite set family G is a transversal to F , and hence,
is a set that illuminates K. One can show that

:

(16)

diam(Ui) ≤ 1 + ε.

Let V (t) := inf{σ(F +) : F ⊂ Sn−1, diam S ≤ t}. A key element of

We notice that by (16),

V (1+ε) is a fractional transversal to G. Now,
the original proof is completed by applying the dual of (10) to get
− ln(1−V (1+ε))k. Substituting the bound on N and (17), the

theorem follows. Another way to complete the proof is to use the dual
of Lemma 5.2, which yields the slightly worse bound i(W ) < 1+ln N
V (1+ε) .

6.2. Fractional illumination. The notion of fractional illumination
was deﬁned in [Nas09], and then further studied in [AAR11].

Deﬁnition 6.3. The fractional illumination number of a convex body
K in Rn is

i∗(K) = N∗(K, int K).

It was observed in [Nas09] that by (12) and the Rogers–Shepard

inequality (vol(K − K) ≤(cid:0)2n

(18)

n(cid:1) vol(K)) we have
i∗(K) ≤(2n
if K = −K,
(cid:0)2n
n(cid:1)
otherwise.

The fractional form of the Illumination Conjecture (weaker than the
i∗(K) ≤ 2n, and equality is attained by parallelo-
original) reads:
topes only. When K is symmetric, the case of equality was settled
by Artstein–Avidan and Slomka [AAS13] using a lemma by Schneider.
Interestingly, no better bound is known, so the fractional form of the
Illumination Conjecture does not seem much easier than the original.
On the other hand, just as in general, for N(K, L) and N∗(K, L), we
do not have an upper bound of i(K) in terms of i∗(K).

The fractional version of Borsuk’s problem can be stated in a natural
way, and was investigated in [HL14]. We note that the example of a
set in Rn with high Borsuk number given by Kahn and Kalai (see 6.1)
is a set with high fractional Borsuk number as well.

7. Decomposability of multiple coverings

An m–fold covering of Rn by translates of a set K is a family F of
translates of K such that each point is contained in at least m members.
It is a natural question whether, for a particular K, if m is large enough
(say, at least m(K)), then all m–fold coverings of Rn by translates of
K can be decomposed into two coverings. That is, can F be colored
with two colors such that each color class of F is a covering of Rn?

FLAVORS OF TRANSLATIVE COVERINGS

15

It was proved in [Pac86] that if K is a centrally symmetric convex
polygon then such m(K) exists. This was generalized to all convex
polygons in [TT07, PT10].

Arguably the most natural special case was asked by Pach [Pac80]:
consider the open unit disk. The un–published manuscript [MLP86]
was cited several times as having given a positive answer in this case,
though, Pach [PT09] warned that the result “has not been indepen-
dently veriﬁed.” The following result of Mani–Levitska and Pach (see
[AS08]) also suggested that such m(K) should exist for unit disks. For
every n ≥ 2, there is a positive constant cn with the following property.
For every positive integer m, any m–fold covering of Rn with unit balls
can be decomposed into two coverings, provided that no point of the
space belongs to more than cn2m/n balls. This result was one of the
ﬁrst geometric applications of the Lov´asz local lemma.

Surprisingly, the answer is negative. P´alv¨olgyi and Pach [PP13] re-

cently showed that there is no such m(K) for the open unit disk.

Their proof consists of a combinatorial part followed by an intricate
geometric argument. First, consider the dual problem in the abstract
setting of hypergraphs. We ﬁx an m, and based on [P´al10], construct
an abstract hypergraph H with the property that each edge contains at
least m vertices, but for any two–coloring of the vertices, at least one
edge will contain only vertices of one color. Then, the hypergraph is
given a geometric realization, that is, the vertex set is mapped to a set
of points on the plane, and the edges are mapped to open unit disks in
an incidence–preserving manner, that is, a vertex belongs to an edge
if and only if, the corresponding point belongs to the corresponding
disk. This yields a ﬁnite set (the centers of the disks) in the plane
that is m–fold covered by unit disks (the disks around the points) in
an indecomposable way. Finally, this m–fold covering of this ﬁnite set
is extended to an m–fold covering of the whole plane without adding
any disk that contains any of the points in the ﬁnite set.

For more on decomposability of coverings, see [PP13], and references

therein.

8. An asymptotic view

In this section, we present two topics to illustrate the point of view
taken in the asymptotic theory of convex bodies on the problem of
translative coverings.

8.1. Sudakov’s inequlity relates the minimum number of Euclidean
balls that cover a symmetric convex body to the mean width of the
body, where the latter is deﬁned as

(19)

hK(u) + hK(−u) dσ(u).
(See the deﬁnition of σ and hK in the introduction.)

w(K) =ZSn−1

16

M. NASZ ´ODI

Theorem 8.1 (Sudakov’s inequality, [Sud71]). For any symmetric con-
vex body K in Rn and any t > 0, we have

log N(K, tBn

t (cid:19)2
2 ) ≤ cn(cid:18)w(K)

with an absolute constant c > 0.

It was observed by Tomczak–Jaegermann [TJ87], that this inequal-
ity can be obtained from a dual form proved by Pajor and Tomczak–
Jaegermann [PTJ85].

Theorem 8.2 (Dual Sudakov inequality). For any symmetric convex
body K in Rn and any t > 0, we have

log N(Bn

t (cid:19)2
2 , tK) ≤ cn(cid:18)w(K∗)

with an absolute constant c > 0.

First, we sketch a proof of Theorem 8.2 due to Talagrand [Tal91],
[LT91], and later turn to the proof of Theorem 8.1. The main idea
is to apply a volumetric argument, but, instead of using the Lebesgue
measure, one uses the Gaussian measure. Recall, that the Gaussian
measure γn is an absolutely continuous probability measure on Rn,
with density

dγn(x) =

e−|x|2/2
(2π)n/2 dx.

First, by computation one obtains that for any origin–symmetric con-
vex body K in Rn and any translation vector z ∈ Rn, we have
(20)
Next, we consider a maximal set {x1, . . . , xN} in Bn
2 with the property
that kxi − xjkK ≥ t for all i, j pairs. Now, for any rescaling factor
λ > 0, we have that {λxi + λt
2 K : i = 1, . . . , N} is a packing in λBn
2 ,
and thus, the total γn–measure of these sets is at most one. Integration
in polar coordinates yields that

γn(K + z) ≥ e−|z|2/2γn(K).

γn(cid:18) λt

K(cid:19) ≥ 1 −

2c√n
λt

w(K∗)

for an absolute constant c > 0. With the choice λ = 4c√nw(K∗)/t,
we have γn(K) ≥ 1
2. Finally, using (20), we obtain the bound in The-
orem 8.2.

We note that this proof yields a little more than stated in the Theo-
rem. We obtain an upper bound on the minimum size of a covering of
Bn
2 by translates of tK with the constraint that the translation vectors
are in Bn
2 .

The following Lemma is the key to reducing Theorem 8.1 to Theo-

rem 8.2.

8.2. Duality of covering numbers. We brieﬂy mention the following
open problem in geometric analysis, for a comprehensive discussion, cf.
Chapter 4 of [AAGM15].

Conjecture 8.4. There are universal constants c, C > 0 such that for
any dimension n and any two symmetric convex bodies K and L in Rn,
we have

N(K, L) ≤ N(L∗, cK∗)C.

The problem is known as the Duality of entropy, and was posed by
Pietsch [Pie72]. An important special case, when K or L is a Euclidean
ball (or, equivalently, an ellipsoid) was conﬁrmed by Artstein–Avidan,
Milman and Szarek [AMS04].

9. Covering by sequences of sets

So far, we considered problems where a set was to be covered by
translates of another ﬁxed set. Now, we turn to problems where a
family F of sets is given, and we need to ﬁnd a translation for each set
in F to obtain a covering of a given set C. If such translations exist,
we say that F permits a translative covering of C. We call F a bounded
family, if the set of diameters of members of F is a bounded set.
For a comprehensive account of coverings by sequences of convex
sets, see the surveys [Gro85, Fej04]. Here, we do not discuss a closely
related topic, Tarski’s plank problem – for a recent survey, see [Bez13].

9.1. Covering (almost) the whole space. Clearly, for F to permit
a translative covering of Rn, it is necessary that the total volume of the
members of F be inﬁnite. It is not suﬃcient, though. Indeed, consider
rectangles of side lengths i by 1/i2 for i = 1, 2, . . . on the plane. Their
total area is inﬁnite, and yet, according to Bang’s theorem, they do
not permit a translative covering of R2 [Fej04]. On the other hand, if
a family of planar convex sets is bounded and has inﬁnite total area,
then it permits a translative covering of R2 [MP83, Gro82].
It is an
open problem whether the same holds for n > 2.

A covering of almost all of some set C is a covering of a subset of C

whose complement in C is of measure zero.
Theorem 9.1 (Groemer, [Gro79]). Let F be a bounded family of Lebesgue
measurable sets. Then F permits a translative covering of almost all
of Rn if and only if, PF∈F
Indeed, let F = {F1, F2, . . .} be a bounded family with inﬁnite total
volume. Clearly, it is suﬃcient to cover almost all of the cube C =
[−1/2, 1/2]n. We may assume that F ⊂ C for all F ∈ F .

the condition that F contains only convex sets, see [Gro85].
9.2. A suﬃcient condition for a family of homothets. For convex
bodies K and L, we deﬁne f (K, L) as the inﬁmum of those t > 0,
such that for any family F of homothets of L with coeﬃcients 0 <
λ1, λ2,· · · < 1, the following holds:

λd
i ≥ t then F permits a translative covering of K.

We set f (n) := sup{f (K, K) : K ⊂ Rn a convex body}.
The question of bounding f (2) was originally posed by L. Fejes T´oth
[FT84] (cf. Section 3.2 in [BMP05]). He conjectured that f (2) ≤ 3.
Januszewski [Jan03] showed that f (2) ≤ 6.5.

Meir and Moser [MM68], and later, A. Bezdek and K. Bezdek [BB84]
considered the cube and proved that f ([0, 1]d) = 2d− 1. Using a simple

f (K, L) ≤ 2n

follows.

On the other hand, clearly, f (K, K) ≥ n since we may consider n
homothetic copies of K with homothety ratios slightly below one, and
use the lower bound on the illumination number of K (see Section 6).

9.3. A necessary condition for a family of homothets. A con-
verse to the problem discussed above was formulated by V. Soltan
[Sol90] (cf. Section 3.2 in [BMP05]). Let

g(K) := inf(Xi

λi : K ⊆[i

λiK + xi, 0 < λi < 1) ,

and g(n) := inf{g(K) : K ⊂ Rn a convex body}. V. Soltan conjec-
tured g(n) ≥ n.
Since the n-dimensional simplex ∆ can be covered by n+1 translates
n+1∆, we have that g(n) ≤ g(∆) ≤ n. V. Soltan and ´E. V´as´arhelyi
of
[SV93] showed g(2) ≥ 2, and also proved that the conjecture holds
when only n + 1 homothets are allowed.
Soltan’s conjecture was conﬁrmed in an asymptotic sense in [Nas10]:
