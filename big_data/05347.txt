A Hierarchical Approach to Stability Assessment of Large Scale

Interconnected Networks

Thanh Long Vu, Member, IEEE and Konstantin Turitsyn, Member, IEEE

Abstract— Interconnected networks describe the dynamics of
important systems in a wide range such as biological systems
and electrical power grids. Some important features of these
systems were successfully studied and understood through
simpliﬁed model of linear interconnection of linear subsystems,
where provably global properties, e.g. global convergence to a
speciﬁc state, usually hold true. However, in severely disturbed
conditions many of those systems exhibit strongly nonlinear
behaviour. Particularly, multiple equilibrium points may coexist
and make the dynamical behavior of the system difﬁcult to
predict. Aiming at understanding the fragility of interconnected
systems, we will provide a hierarchical framework to assess the
metastability and resilience of such systems. This framework
is based on independently characterizing stability of individual
subsystems when they are uncoupled from the network, and
then enforcing the diagonal dominance property on a structure
matrix capturing the subsystems stability and the input-to-
output gains of interconnection network. Since the subsystems
are usually of low order and the structure matrix has size
equal to the number of subsystems, this framework is easy
to implement and thus scalable to large scale interconnected
systems. Possible application of this framework in assessing
stability of microgrids will be discussed at the end of this paper.

I. INTRODUCTION

Large scale, complex, interconnected system models cap-
ture the dynamics of multiple physical, biological, and social
structures such as Internet, power grids, brain, and econom-
ical systems, etc. In recent years, interconnected systems
have been widely investigated to study various dynamical
properties of complex systems in biology [1], social sciences
[2], physics [3], computer science [4], and engineering [5].
It is well recognized that severe disturbance may expose
the fragility of such systems and even lead to catastrophic
failure, such as power outages, nervous disorder, and eco-
nomic collapses. Therefore,
to understand
the interconnected systems’ stability and resilience, i.e. the
ability of the system to withstand some probable disturbance
and return to stable operating conditions.

is essential

it

Many works have been then devoted to investigate the
dynamical properties of interconnected systems, especially
those described by linear interconnection of linear subsys-
tems. For this type of networks, stability analysis and control
design are extensively investigated in control community,
mainly in the context of consensus in multi-agent systems
[6]–[8]. A fortunate feature of these simpliﬁed linear models

is that global stability of the interconnected system can be
guaranteed.

It is worth to note that in extreme conditions, many in-
terconnected systems manifest strongly nonlinear behaviour.
Remarkably, multiple equilibrium points may coexist, draw a
complicated contraction landscape, and make the dynamical
behavior of the system difﬁcult to predict. A typical example
is the transient dynamics of power grids following a large
disturbance, such as line tripping, short circuit, etc. The most
simple but practically acceptable model to describe the grid
post-fault dynamics is the so-called swing equations:

mk ¨δk + dk ˙δk = Pk − X

{k,j}∈E

Bkj sin(δk − δj).

(1)

This model captures the dynamics of the generators’ ro-
tor angle δk and its angular velocity ˙δk after the grid is
disturbed. Here, the inherently nonlinear sinusoid functions
Bkj sin(δk − δj) representing the electrical power ﬂows
between generators in the network E cannot be ignored.
These nonlinear functions result
in a system possessing
multiple equilibria with their own region of attraction. As
such, the transient stability of power grids, after the fault is
cleared, can only obtained locally, i.e. when the fault-cleared
state stays in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point.
Therefore, to understand the fragility of complex structures
in response to extreme events, it is imperative to establish
a powerful tool capable of assessing such metastability of
nonlinear interconnected systems. Unfortunately, there are
not many sufﬁcient tools to characterize stability of nonlinear
interconnected systems where multiple equilibrium points
coexist.

Another main challenge for the stability assessment of
large scale interconnected systems is the computational com-
plexity. In the context of power grids, there are thousands to
millions of dynamically interacting components, all of which
contribute to the stability of the overall grid. This extreme
scale causes the grid stability assessment problem a com-
putationally expensive task. One of the efﬁcient approaches,
with acceptable computational complexity, is based the hi-
erarchical framework in which the interconnected network
is analyzed through a combination of subsystems’ stability
assessment and network connection assessment. Multiple
works utilizing this framework were presented, such as small
gain theorem [9], passivity-based approach [10], [11], and
contraction analysis of interconnected systems [12]. Again,
these works were only devoted to interconnected systems
possessing global stability.

In this paper, we aim to alleviate the aforementioned

drawback of the global-stability-based approaches, while
still targeting at the reduction of computational complexity.
Inspired by the works [10]–[12] and connective stability
analysis [13], we will present a hierarchical approach to
analyze the stability of nonlinear interconnected systems that
don’t possess global stability. This approach is based on
two steps: (i) characterizing the stability of each nonlinear
subsystem when it is unperturbed from the network; (ii)
estimating the coupling gains in the interconnection network.
We prove that if the structure matrix, which captures the
stability feature of both individual subsystems and the inter-
connection gains, is diagonally dominant, then there always
exists a linear combination of the subsystems’ Lyapunov
functions to assessing stability of the whole interconnected
systems. As such, the assessment process mostly reduces to
establishing Lyapunov functions for the subsystems, which
is a computationally tractable task since the subsystems are
usually of low order. Therefore, the proposed hierarchical
approach is scalable to assessing stability of large scale
interconnected systems.

On the other hand, to reduce the possible conservativeness,
we exploit the idea of the recently introduced Lyapunov
Functions Family method [14] to construction of inner ap-
proximations of the attraction region. The principle of this
method is to provide stability certiﬁcates by constructing a
family of Lyapunov functions, and then ﬁnd the best suited
function in the family for given initial states. Accordingly,
we present a novel adaptation algorithm capable of ﬁnding
a suitable Lyapunov function after a ﬁnite number of steps.
As the last contribution, we show that the proposed approach
can be applicable to analysis of the robust stability of inter-
connected networks with uncertain links and to assessment
of system resilience.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section II we
introduce the model of a linear interconnection of nonlinear
subsystems, which lacks of global stability and naturally
gives raise to the need of tool for assessing its metastability.
On top of this model, we formulate the stability assessment
problem. In Section III the main results of the paper are pre-
sented where we explicitly construct the family of Lyapunov
functions and inscribe the corresponding regions of attraction
estimate. Also, we show how to adapt this Lyapunov function
family to given initial states and how to robustly assess
the stability of the system when the interconnection gains
are uncertain. Finally, we present the simulation results in
Section IV and conclude the paper in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

To study the dynamic stability of nonlinear interconnected
systems,
this paper considers a network interconnecting
multiple homogeneous nonlinear subsystems, each of which
is described by the following equations:

˙xk = Akxk + fk(xk) + Bkuk
yk = Ckxk, k = 1, .., n,

(2)

where, xk ∈ Rnk , uk ∈ R, and yk ∈ R are the state,
input, and output of the kth subsystems. Here, Ak is a

matrix capturing the linear dynamics of the kth subsystem.
By introducing slack variables, many systems in practice can
be described by polynomial differential equations, in which
case fk(xk) characterizes the high order dynamics of the
kth subsystem. Note that the analysis in this paper is also
applicable to subsystems with multiple inputs and multiple
outputs. Let u = [u1 ... un]⊤ and y = [y1 ... yn]⊤. The
linear network describes the linear relation from the set of
network inputs y = {y1, ..., yn} to the set of network outputs
u = {u1, ..., un} :

u = Ly.

(3)

Here, L = [Lkj]n
k,j=1 is the matrix characterizing the
interconnection in the network: Lkj = 0 if there is no
directed coupling from the the signal yj to signal uk, and
Lkj 6= 0 if there is a directed coupling from the the signal
yj to signal uk. Substituting (3) into (2), we obtain:
˙xk = Akxk + fk(xk) + Bk X

LkjCjxj, k = 1, ..., n (4)

j∈Nk

where Nk is the set of indexes of signal yj coupled with the
signal uk. In normal condition, the interconnected system
operates at some equilibrium points, which are solutions of
the steady state equation:
Akxk + fk(xk) + Bk X

LkjCjxj = 0, k = 1, ..., n. (5)

j∈Nk

Since the functions fk(xk) are nonlinear functions, there may
exist multiple solutions of equation (5), each of which is an
equilibrium point of the system. Therefore, the global stabil-
ity is never obtained for such kind of systems. Particularly,
each equilibrium point has its own region of attraction, i.e.
the set of initial states from which the system will converge
to that equilibrium point.

In this paper, we consider the case that the system is
working at a equilibrium point and then disturbed by some

disruption, e.g. losing a coupling link. After some time,
the failed coupling is ﬁxed and the system returns back to
its original topology, but the state of the network deviates
from the equilibrium point. We are concerned if the post-
fault interconnected system will return back to the original
equilibrium point, i.e. if the system withstand the disruption.
Formally, the problem considered in this paper is formulated
as follows.

For this network, we propose to use the following family

of Lyapunov functions

V (x) =

n

X

k=1

ck(xk − x∗

k)⊤Pk(xk − x∗
k)

(9)

where ck > 0, k = 1, ..., n are constant parameters charac-
terizing the Lyapunov function family. From (8) we have the
derivative of the Lyapunov function V (x) along (8) as

Stability Assessment: Given the post-fault
state
x1(0), ..., xn(0), assess if the network will converge
from the state x1(0), ..., xn(0) to the equilibrium point
x∗ = [x∗
n], i.e. if the state x1(0), ..., xn(0) stays
inside the region of attraction of the stable equilibrium
point x∗ = [x∗

1, ..., x∗

1, ..., x∗

n].

To address this problem, we assume that for each unper-
turbed subsystem (i.e. it is uncoupled from the network) the
equilibrium point x∗ is locally stable. Mathematically, this
condition can be expressed by the following assumptions.

Assumption 1: The matrices Ak are Hurwitz, i.e. there
exist positive deﬁnite matrices Pk and positive numbers λk
such that

λmax(A⊤

k Pk + PkAk) ≤ −λk, k = 1, ..., n,

(6)

where λmax(A) denotes the maximum eigenvalue of the
symmetric matrix A.

Assumption 2: There exist positive numbers dk, k =
1, ..., n, such that
the higher order dynamics fk(xk) is
dominated by the linear dynamics in the ball of radius dk
surrounding the equilibrium point x∗
k, i.e. there exist positive
numbers µk > 0, k = 1, ..., n such that

|(xk − x∗

k)⊤Pk(fk(xk) − fk(x∗

k))| ≤ µkkxk − x∗

kk2,

(7)

whenever xk stays in the ball kxk − x∗
kk ≤ dk. In this paper,
k.k denotes the 2-norm of vectors and induced 2-norm of
matrices.

III. LYAPUNOV FUNCTIONS FAMILY FOR

METASTABILITY ANALYSIS

A. Lyapunov Functions Family

To address the stability assessment problem formulated in
the previous section we will use a sequence of techniques
originating from nonlinear control theory. The procedure here
is similar to the connective stability analysis in the work
of ˇSiljak [13], but we aim to analyze the local stability
of interconnected systems where the global stability can
be never obtained. First of all we rewrite the dynamic
equations (4) such that the equilibrium point is shifted to the
origin, making it suitable for application of classical stability
analysis. Substituting equation (5) into (4), we obtain

˙V (x) inside the set R. As such, to check if a given

k) is decreasing whenever kxk − x∗

k=1 ck(xk −

Then,
x∗
k)⊤Pk(xk − x∗
dk, ∀k = 1, ..., n.

Establishing the Lyapunov function V (x) is based on
solving the LMI (14) for the given structure matrix M
which captures the features of both subsystems stability and
interconnection network. This LMI can be formulated as a
convex optimization problem. In addition, since the structure
matrix M has the size equal to the number of subsystems,
which is not very large, this LMI can be quickly solved by
the advanced Semideﬁnite programming solvers (e.g. [15],
[16]). Therefore, the proposed approach signiﬁcantly reduces
the computational complexity of the stability assessment
process for large scale interconnected systems, in which most
of computational load is spent on constructing Lyapunov
functions (characterized by positive deﬁnite matrices Pk) for
the subsystems of low orders.

An easy-to-check condition for the existence of the matrix

C is given in the following theorem.

j=1,j6=k αkj < 0 for all
k = 1, ..., n. Then, there exists a positive, diagonal matrix
C satisfying the LMI (14)

Proof: See Appendix.

B. Constructions of Invariant Sets

The existence of a positive, diagonal matrix C as in
Theorem 1 ensures the decreasing of the Lyapunov function
V (x) in the set P = {x : kxk − x∗
kk ≤ dk, ∀k = 1, ..., n}.
There, however, may exist the case when the initial state lies
inside P, but after some time periods, the system trajectory
escapes from the set P. Then the Lyapunov function V (x)
is no longer decreasing, and the system trajectory may tend
to undesired region. In order to ensure that the system will
not escape the set P during transient dynamics we will add
one condition to restrict the set of initial states inside P.

Formally, we deﬁne the minimization of the function V (x)

over boundary of P:

Vmin = min
x∈∂P

V (x)

(15)

Due to the independence of xk from other state xj, j 6= k,
it holds that

Vmin = min

k=1,...,n

min
kxk−x∗

kk=dk

ck(xk − x∗

k)⊤Pk(xk − x∗

k).

The corresponding invariant set is deﬁned as:

R = {x ∈ P : V (x) < Vmin}.

(16)

The decay property of Lyapunov function in the set P en-
sures that the system trajectory cannot escape R. Therefore,
staring from any initial state inside the set R, the system will
only evolve inside R and eventually converge to the desired
stable equilibrium point x∗ due to the negative deﬁniteness

C. Adaptation of Lyapunov Functions to Initial States

The family of Lyapunov functions characterized by the
diagonal matrix C satisfying the LMI (14) allow us to ﬁnd
a Lyapunov function that is best suited for a given initial
state x0 ∈ P or family of initial states. In the following, we
apply the stability certiﬁcate in Theorem 1 and propose a
simple algorithm for the adaptation of Lyapunov functions
to a given initial state x0.

Let ǫ be a positive constant.

− Step 1: Find C (1) by solving the LMI (14). Calculate

V (1)(x0) and V (1)

min where

V (1)(x) =

n

X

k=1

c(1)
k (xk − x∗

k)⊤Pk(xk − x∗

k).

− Step n: If x0 /∈ R(C (n−1)), then ﬁnd C (n) by solving

the following LMIs:

M ⊤C (n) + C (n)M < 0,

(17)

n

X

k=1

c(n)
k (xk(0) − x∗

k)⊤Pk(xk(0) − x∗

k) ≤ V (n−1)

min − ǫ

(18)

Suppose that at Step n, we still have x0 /∈ R(C (n)), i.e.,

V (n)(x0) ≥ V (n)

min, ∀i = 1, .., n. Then,

V (n)
min ≤ V (n)(x0) =

n

X

k=1

c(n)
k (xk(0) − x∗

k)⊤Pk(xk(0) − x∗
k)

≤ V (n−1)

min − ǫ ≤ ... ≤ V (1)

min − (n − 1)ǫ.

(19)

Since V (n)(x) is lower bounded, this algorithm will ter-
minate after a ﬁnite number of the steps. There are two
alternatives exit then. If V (n)(x0) < V (n)
min, then the Lya-
punov function is identiﬁed. Otherwise, the value of ǫ is
reduced by a factor of 2 until a valid Lyapunov function
is found. Therefore, whenever the stability certiﬁcate of the
given initial condition exists, this algorithm possibly ﬁnds it
after a ﬁnite number of iterations.

D. Robust Stability Assessment

In practice, there may exist uncertainties in the system
dynamics, e.g. the coupling gains of the linear network are
unknown. However, we assume that these gains are bounded
in the means that:

|Lkj| ≤ ¯lkj, ∀k, j

(20)

Let ¯αkj = 2¯lkjkPkBkkkCjk if there is a coupling from yj to
uk, and αkj = 0 otherwise. Similar to Section III.A, we can

Therefore, if the robust structure matrix ¯M is diagonally
dominant, then from Theorem 2 we can ﬁnd a positive,
diagonal matrix C such that the matrix ( ¯M ⊤C + C ¯M ) is
negative deﬁnite. Then we have the same stability analysis
as in Sections III.B and III.C. It is worth to note that this
robust stability certiﬁcate is applicable to some networks
with nonlinear couplings, such as power grids where the
power ﬂows are nonlinear but linearly bounded.

E. Resilience Analysis

The stability certiﬁcate presented in the previous sections
allows us to analyze the resilience of interconnected net-
works when there are some possible losings of the intercon-
nection link. Indeed, we can see that if the subsystems are
sufﬁciently stable and the gains of interconnection network
are not very large such that the robust structure matrix ¯M
is diagonally dominant, then we can still ﬁnd the Lyapunoc
function V (x) characterized by the diagonal matrix C even
when there are some permanently lost links. Therefore, in
this case the system is still capable of withstanding the
disturbance of permanently losing links and returning to its
stable operating condition. In case when the subsystems are
not sufﬁciently stable, resilience analysis can be performed
in term of estimating the time period for losing links [17].

IV. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATION

To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach we
consider an artiﬁcial time-varying interconnected network of
the following subsystems

˙xk = −10xk + akx2
yk = xk, k = 1, ..., 20

k + uk

(21)

(22)

We are interested to assess the stability of some initial state
with respect to the equilibrium point x∗
k = 0, k = 1, ..., 20.
The gain of high order dynamics satisﬁes |ak| ≤ 1. The

interconnection network couples each subsystem with its two
around subsystems and constitutes a loop. Particularly, the
network is time-varying and described by

u = L(t)y

where the interconnection matrix L(t) is given by

set: ak = 0.9, for k = 1, ..., 10, ak = k/20, for k =

1.9 sin xk, k = 1, ..., 20, and Lk+1,k = −1.8 cos xk, k =

V. CONCLUSIONS AND PATH FORWARD

This paper has presented a scalable framework for as-
sessing the transient stability of interconnection of nonlinear
subsystems, where many equilibrium points may coexist and
the global stability is never obtained. The proposed method
was based on two independent steps: (i) characterizing the
stability of each nonlinear subsystem when it is uncoupled
from the network; (ii) estimating the input-to-output gains
in the interconnection network. The stability of the inter-
connected nonlinear systems was then assessed through the
establishment of a linear combination of Lyapunov functions
of the subsystems. This combination was shown to exist for
systems with diagonally dominant structure matrix. The sta-
bility condition on the interconnection network was derived
in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) form with linear matrix
size equal to the number of subsystems.

By construction,

the proposed approach is scalable to
large interconnected systems, such as power grids. We also
derived an explicit inner approximation of the stability region
of the equilibrium point, and showed how the Lyapunov
functions can be adapted to certify transient stability for any
given initial state. Finally, we discussed how the proposed
approach can be applied to stability assessment of uncertain
interconnected networks.

In the future we plan to explore possible strategies of
reducing the overall conservativeness of the proposed cer-
tiﬁcates. We also plan to extend the framework to nonlinear
descriptor systems commonly used for modeling power sys-
tems and develop more systematic approaches for estimation
of subsystem gains based on modern algebraic techniques
[18], [19].

VI. APPENDIX: PROOF OF THEOREM 2

Given the ∞−norm on the Euclidean space and its in-
duced matrix norm kAk∞, the associated matrix measure
of A is deﬁned (see e.g. [20]) as the one-sided directional
derivative of the matrix norm in the direction of the A
evaluated at the identity, i.e.

µ∞(A) = lim
h↓0

kI + hAk∞ − 1

h

(24)

In can be proved that for A = [aij]n
i,j=1 we have µ∞(A) =
maxi=1,...,n(aii + Pj=1,...,n,j6=i |aij|). Therefore, the diag-
onal dominance property of M implies that the ∞−norm
induced matrix measure of the matrix M is negative. Note
that the ∞−norm induced matrix measure of the matrix M
is always larger than or equal to max1≤k≤n Reλk(M ) [21],
where λk(M ), k = 1, ..., n, are eigenvalues of M. Hence, we
conclude that Reλk(M ) < 0 for all k = 1, ..., n. Therefore,

the matrix (−M ) is an M-matrix and thus, there exists a
positive, diagonal matrix C such that (M ⊤C + CM ) is
negative deﬁnite [22].
