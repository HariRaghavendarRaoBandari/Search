A characteristic 2 recurrence related to U3,

with a Hecke algebra application

Abstract

I begin with a simple modular form motivated proof of the following: Let Cn in
Z/2[[t]] be deﬁned by Cn+4 = Cn+3 + (t4 + t3 + t2 + t)Cn + tn(t2 + t), with initial
values 0, 1, t and t2 for C0, C1, C2 and C3. Then every C4m is a sum of Ck with
k < 4m.

This, combined with earlier results, yields: If K consists of all mod 2 modular
forms of level Γ0(3) annihilated by U2 and U3 + I, then K has a basis adapted (in
the sense of Nicolas and Serre) to the Hecke operators T7 and T13; consequently the
Hecke algebra attached to K is a power series ring in these two operators.

1 The polynomials Cn

In the ﬁnite characteristic theory of modular forms, the Hecke operators Tp
give rise to remarkable recursions. J.-L. Nicolas and J.-P. Serre [3,4] used
recurrences attached to T3 and T5 to show that the characteristic 2 level 1
Hecke algebra is a power series ring in these two operators. In [2] I gave a level
3 variant of the Nicolas-Serre results; my underlying space was a subquotient,
N2/N1, of the space of mod 2 modular forms of level Γ0(3), and the resulting
Hecke algebra contained nilpotents.

In fact, the Hecke operators Up, where p divides the level, also give interesting
recurrences. I begin this note with one such recurrence, coming from U3 in
characteristic 2 and level 3. Section 1 introduces Cn, n ≥ 0, in Z/2[t], satisfying
the recurrence. Section 2 proves a basic property—each C4m is a Z/2-linear
combination of Ck with k < 4m. This is built on in section 3. In the ﬁnal
section I combine my results with results from [2] to show the following. Let
K consist of the mod 2 modular forms of level Γ0(3) annihilated by U2 and
U3 +I. Then K “admits a basis adapted to T7 and T13”, and the Hecke algebra
attached to K is a power series ring in these two operators.

Remark Sections 1–3 use nothing more than algebra in a polynomial ring
Z/2[r]. The arguments I make are really modular forms arguments in trans-
parent disguise—Z/2[r] is really a ring of modular forms, F and G are really
the mod 2 reductions of ∆(z) and ∆(3z), U : Z/2[r] → Z/2[r] is really U3,
and T : Z/2[F ] → Z/2[F ] is really T3, but all this can be ignored. The ﬁnal
section, however, does require some acquaintance with [2] and with modular
forms.

Deﬁnition 1.1 F and G are the elements r(r + 1)3 and r3(r + 1) of Z/2[r].
Note that F + G = r(r + 1) and that F 4 + G4 + F G = 0.

Deﬁnition 1.2 ϕ : Z/2[r] → Z/2[r] is “semi-linear” if it is Z/2-linear and
ϕ(Gf ) = F ϕ(f ).

Since a basis of Z/2[r] as module over Z/2[G] = Z/2[r4 + r3] is 1, r, r2, r3, a
semi-linear map is determined by the images of these 4 elements, and for any
choice of 4 elements to be images, there is a corresponding semi-linear map.

Deﬁnition 1.3 U : Z/2[r] → Z/2[r] is the semi-linear map taking 1, r, r2
and r3 to 1, r, r2 and r3 + r2 + r. Since U(1) = 1, U takes Gn to F n.

Lemma 1.4 U(f 2) = (U(f ))2.

Proof Since 1, r, r2, r3 is a basis of Z/2[r] over Z/2[G], and U(G) = F , it
suﬃces to prove this when f is 1, r, r2 and r3. The cases f = 1 and f = r are
immediate. And:

r4 = G + r3. So U(r4) = F + (r3 + r2 + r) = r4 = (U(r2))2.
r6 = (r2 + r)G + r4. So U(r6) = (r2 + r)F + r4 = r6 + r2 + r4 = (U(r3))2. ✷

Lemma 1.5
(a) U(rn+4) = U(rn+3) + (r4 + r3 + r2 + r)U(rn).
(b) U((r2 + r)r2n) = (r2 + r)An(r2) for some An in Z/2[t].

Proof r4 = r3 + G. Multiplying by rn, applying U and using semi-linearity
we get (a). When n = 0, we have (b) with A0 = 1. Suppose n ≥ 1. Then by
(a) and Lemma 1.4, U((r2 + r)r2n) = (r4 + r3 + r2 + r)U(r2n−2) = (r2 + r)(r2 +
1)(U(rn−1))2. So if we write U(rn−1) as g(r) and set An = (t + 1)g(t), we get
(b). ✷

Lemma 1.6 Let An be as in Lemma 1.5. Then:

(a) An+4 = An+3 + (t4 + t3 + t2 + t)An.
(b) A0, A1, A2 and A3 are 1, t + 1, t2 + t and t3 + t2.

Proof r8 = r6 +G2. Multiplying by (r2+r)r2n, applying U, and then dividing

2

by r2 + r, we ﬁnd that An+4(r2) = An+3(r2) + (r8 + r6 + r4 + r2)An(r2), giving
(a). A0 is evidently 1. Since U ﬁxes 1, r and r2, the last sentence in the proof
of Lemma 1.5 shows that A1, A2 and A3 are t + 1, t2 + t and t3 + t2. ✷

Deﬁnition 1.7 Cn in Z/2[t] is An + tn, with An as in Lemma 1.5.

Theorem 1.8
(a) Cn+4 = Cn+3 + (t4 + t3 + t2 + t)Cn + tn(t2 + t).
(b) C0, C1, C2 and C3 are 0, 1, t and t2.
(c) U + I takes (r2 + r)r2n to (r2 + r)Cn(r2).

Proof (a) and (b) are immediate from (a) and (b) of Lemma 1.6, while (c)
comes from Lemma 1.5 (b). ✷

Lemma 1.9 If Cn is a Z/2-linear combination of Ck with k < n, then 4
divides n.

Proof Note ﬁrst that degree Cn = n − 1 if n ≡/ 0 (4) and is < n − 1 if
n ≡ 0 (4). This follows from (b) of Theorem 1.8 if n < 4, and from induction
using (a) of Theorem 1.8 in general. So if n ≡/ 0 (4), degree Cn = n − 1 while
each Ck, k < n, has degree < n − 1, and Cn is not a Z/2-linear combination
of such Ck. ✷

2 A key property of the Cn

We shall prove a converse to Lemma 1.9—each C4m is a Z/2-linear combination
of Ck with k < 4m. In [1], I asked whether this was true, and Peter M¨uller,
in a computer calculation taking a few seconds, showed that it held for 4m <
10, 000. I then succeeded in ﬁnding a proof.

Lemma 2.1 U takes 1, F , F 2 and F 3 to 1, G, G2 and G3 + F .

Proof U(F + G) = U(r2 + r) = r2 + r = F + G. Since U(G) = F , U(F ) = G.
So U(F 2) = G2. Also, Deﬁnition 1.1 shows that F 3 = (r + 1)8G, and that
G3 = r8F . Since U(r8) = r8, U(F 3) = (r + 1)8F = r8F + F = G3 + F . ✷

Lemma 2.2 Let α be the isomorphism of Z/2[F ] with Z/2[G] taking F n to
Gn. Then if Pn is either α(F n) = Gn or U(F n):

(⋆)

Pn+4 + F 4Pn + F Pn+1 = 0.

Proof As we saw in Deﬁnition 1.1, F 4 + G4 + F G = 0. Multiplying by Gn
we get (⋆) with Pn = α(F n) = Gn. Multiplying instead by F n and applying
the semi-linear operator U we get (⋆) with Pn = U(F n). ✷

3

Deﬁnition 2.3 For f in Z/2[F ], T (f ) = U(f ) + α(f ).

Theorem 2.4
(a) T takes 1, F , F 2 and F 3 to 0, 0, 0 and F .
(b) T stabilizes Z/2[F ]. In fact T (F n) is a sum of F k with k ≤ n − 2 and

congruent to n mod 2.

Proof (a) follows from Lemma 2.1. In particular the second assertion in (b)
holds for n ≤ 3. Now let Pn = T (F n). By Lemma 2.2 these Pn satisfy the
recursion (⋆). An induction on n, using (⋆), completes the proof of (b). ✷

Lemma 2.5 Let u0, u1 and u2 be G, F and (F + G)2G. Then:

(a) The ui are linearly independent over Z/2[G].
(b) Each ui is (r2 + r)g(r2) for some g of degree ≤ 3.

Proof Since 1, F and F 2 are linearly independent over Z/2[G] we get (a).
The g corresponding to u0 and u1 are t and t + 1. And since (F + G)G =
(r2 + r)(r4 + r3) = r6 + r4, the g corresponding to u2 is t3 + t2. ✷

Now ﬁx m ≥ 0.

Deﬁnition 2.6 L is the space spanned by the uiG2n with the ui as above, and
0 ≤ n ≤ m. L∗ consists of the (r2 + r)g(r2), where g in Z/2[t] has degree
≤ 4m + 3.

Lemma 2.7 L has dimension 3m + 3 and is contained in L∗.

(a) of Lemma 2.5 gives the ﬁrst result. Since G2n = (r8 + r6)n and

Proof
n ≤ m, (b) of Lemma 2.5 gives the second. ✷

Remark Let M(odd ) consist of all elements of Z/2[r] of the form (r2 +
r)g(r2), g in Z/2[t]. Lemma 1.5 (b) shows that U stabilizes M(odd ). Moreover
if the An are as in Lemma 1.5, then Lemma 1.6 and an induction show that
degree (An) ≤ n. It follows that U stabilizes L∗. (But when m ≥ 1, U does
not stabilize L. For G3 = G2u0 lies in L, but U(G3) = F 3 is not even a
Z/2[G]-linear combination of u0, u1 and u2).

Lemma 2.8 For 0 ≤ i ≤ 2, (U + I)2 = U 2 + I maps F iGk to F iT (F k).

Proof U(F iGk) = F kU(F i); since i ≤ 2 this is F kGi. Then U 2(F iGk) =
F i(U(F k)) = F iGk + F iT (F k), and U 2 + I takes F iGk to F iT (F k). ✷

Theorem 2.9 Let Km be the kernel of U + I : L∗ → L∗. (The remark shows
that U + I stabilizes L∗.) Then the dimension of Km is greater than or equal
to m + 1.

4

Proof Each uiG2n with n ≤ m is a sum of F iGk where i ≤ 2 and i + k is
both ≤ 2m + 3 and odd. By Lemma 2.8, the image of such an element under
(U + I)2 is a sum of F iT (F k) with i + k ≤ 2m + 3 and odd. By Theorem
2.4 (b) each such F iT (F k) is in the space spanned by the F n with n ≤ 2m + 1
and odd. It follows that the image of L under (U + I)2 has dimension ≤ m + 1,
and that the kernel has dimension ≥ (3m + 3) − (m + 1) = 2m + 2. Since
L ⊂ L∗, (U + I)2 : L∗ → L∗ has a kernel of dimension at least 2m + 2, and
the dimension of Km is at least m + 1. ✷

Theorem 2.10 C4m is a Z/2-linear combination of Ck with k < 4m.

Proof Let L and L∗ be as in Deﬁnition 2.6, and Km be as in Theorem 2.9.
Suppose f = (r2 + r)g(r2) is in Km. Write g as tj+ (a sum of tk with k < j).
Applying U + I and using Theorem 1.8 (c), we ﬁnd that Cj is the sum of the
corresponding Ck. So by Lemma 1.9, 4 divides j. Since j ≤ 4m+ 3, the degree,
2j + 2, of f in r is an element of [0, 8m + 8] that is congruent to 2 mod 8.
Note that there are exactly m + 1 such elements. Now Km admits a Z/2-basis
consisting of elements having distinct degrees in r. We’ve just shown that the
only possible degrees are the m + 1 integers in {2, 10, · · · , 8m + 2}. Since Km
has dimension at least m + 1, all of these degrees do occur, and there is an
f = (r2 + r)g(r2) in Km with degree g = 4m. Write g as t4m+ a sum of tk
with k < 4m. Applying U + I and using Theorem 1.8 (c) once again we ﬁnd
that C4m is the sum of the corresponding Ck. ✷

We conclude this section with:

Lemma 2.11 The kernels of (U + I)2 acting on L and on L∗ are the same.

Proof The proof of Theorem 2.9 shows that the ﬁrst kernel has dimension
at least 2m + 2. So it’s enough to show that the second kernel has dimension
≤ 2m + 2. But in the proof of Theorem 2.10 we constructed a basis of Km
having m + 1 elements. ✷

3 The structure of K

In the last section we constructed a sequence of subspaces K0 ⊂ K1 ⊂ K2 ⊂ . . .
of Z/2[r] and, in the proof of Theorem 2.10, showed that Km has dimension
m + 1.

Deﬁnition 3.1 K is the union of the Km. Alternatively, K is the kernel of
U + I : M(odd ) → M(odd ), where M(odd ) consists of the (r2 + r)g(r2), g in
Z/2[t].

5

In this section we construct an isomorphism between K and a certain subquo-
tient, K1/N1, of Z/2[r].

Deﬁnition 3.2 N2, K1, K5, and N1 are the (free) Z/2[G2]-submodules of
Z/2[r] with the following bases.

A basis is {G, F, F 2G}.

N2:
K1 and K5: Bases are {G, F } and {G, F 2G}.
N1:

A basis is {G}.

Note that N2/N1 is the direct sum of K1/N1 and K5/N1. This gives us a
projection map, pr 1 : N2/N1 → K1/N1.

Lemma 3.3 K ⊂ N2.

Proof Suppose f is in K. Then f is in some Km, f is in an L∗, and by
Lemma 2.11, f is in an L. So f is a Z/2[G2]-linear combination of u0 = G,
u1 = F and u2 = F 2G + G3. ✷

Composing the inclusion of K in N2 with pr 1, we get a map K → K1/N1
which we also call pr 1. Our goal is to show that this pr 1 is bijective.

Lemma 3.4 Suppose f 6= 0 is in K. Write f as (r2 + r)g(r2) with degree g
equal to 4m. Then pr 1 (f ) = (G2m + a sum of G2k, k < m) · F .

Proof G2n(F + G), G2n(G) and G2n+1(F + G)2 have degrees 8n + 2, 8n + 4
and 8n + 8 in r. Lemma 3.3 shows that f , which has degree 8m + 2, is a
sum of G2m(F + G), various G2k(F + G) with k < m, various G2n(G) and
various G2n(F 2G + G3). Applying pr 1 which annihilates each G2n(G) and
each G2n(F 2G), we get the result.

It’s now easy to see that pr 1 : K → K1/N1 is bijective. Recall that for each
m ≥ 0 there is an element (r2 + r)g(r2) of K with degree g = 4m, and that
furthermore if we choose one such element for each m ≥ 0 we get a Z/2-basis
of K. Since the G2mF , m ≥ 0, form a Z/2-basis of K1/N1, Lemma 3.4 gives
the result. ✷

4 The action of Tp and the main theorem

Up to now, everything we’ve done is algebra in a polynomial ring Z/2[r]. We
now connect this with modular forms, using language from [2]. Instead of r
being an indeterminate it is now the explicit element Pn>0(xn2
+
x6n2
) of Z/2[[x]]. Then Z/2[r] is a subspace of Z/2[[x]] and [2], Corollary 2.5,

+ x3n2

+ x2n2

6

shows that this subspace is the space, M, of mod 2 modular forms of level
Γ0(3). (See [2], Deﬁnitions 2.2 and 2.3.)

Deﬁnition 4.1 U2, U3 and Tp (p a prime > 3) are the following commuting
operators on Z/2[[x]].

U2(X anxn) = X a2nxn.
U3(X anxn) = X a3nxn.
Tp(X anxn) = X apnxn + X anxpn.

Lemma 4.2 The above operators stabilize Z/2[r].

This is immediate from the modular forms interpretation of Z/2[r].

Lemma 4.3

F = Pn odd, n>0 xn2
G = F (x3).

.

Proof See [2], Theorem 2.8, and the ﬁrst sentence of [2], section 2. ✷

Lemma 4.4 U3 : Z/2[r] → Z/2[r] is the map U.

Proof Lemma 4.3 shows that U3(Gf ) = F U3(f ). So U3, like U, is semi-linear,
and it’s enough to show that they agree on a basis of Z/2[r] over Z/2[G]. But
they each ﬁx 1, r, r2 and r4. ✷

Lemma 4.5 The M(odd ) of Deﬁnition 3.1 consists of those elements of Z/2[r]
that are odd power series in x. In other words, it is the kernel of U2 : Z/2[r] →
Z/2[r].

Proof See [2], Deﬁnition 2.6 and Theorem 2.7. ✷

Combining Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5 we ﬁnd:

Theorem 4.6 The kernel K of U + I : M(odd ) → M(odd ) is just the space
consisting of those mod 2 modular forms of level Γ0(3) that are annihilated by
U2 and by U3 + I. In particular the Tp, p > 3, stabilize K.

Deﬁnition 4.7 For i = 1 or 2, p3,i : Z/2[[x]] → Z/2[[x]] is the map P anxn →
Pn ≡ i (3) anxn.

Lemma 4.8 K1 consists of those elements of M(odd ) annihilated by p3,2, K5
of those elements annihilated by p3,1.

Proof See [2], Deﬁnition 2.24 and Theorem 2.15. ✷

7

Corollary 4.9 The Tp, p ≡ 1 (6), stabilize K1 and K5. The Tp with p ≡
5 (6) map K1 into K5 and K5 into K1. The Tp with p > 3 stabilize both
N2 = K1 + K5 and N1 = K1 ∩ K5.

Now the Tp with p ≡ 1 (6) act on K; by Corollary 4.9 they also act on K1/N1.

Lemma 4.10 The bijection pr 1 : K → K1/N1 of the last section preserves
the action of the Tp, p ≡ 1 (6).

Proof pr 1 is the composition of K ⊂ N2, N2 → N2/N1 and the projection
map N2/N1 → K1/N1 of the sentence preceding Lemma 3.3. The ﬁrst two
of these maps preserve the action of Tp, p > 3, while the third preserves the
action of Tp, p ≡ 1 (6). (Here we use Lemma 4.8.) ✷

Deﬁnition 4.11 D = x + x25 + x49 + · · · is p3,1(F ). W 1 is spanned by the
Dk, k ≡ 1 (6), W 5 by the Dk, k ≡ 5 (6).

Now let X and Y be the Hecke operators T7 and T13. These act on a number
of spaces we’ve considered, and in particular on W 1, W 5, K1/N1, K5/N1
and K.

Lemma 4.12 W 5 has “a basis adapted to X and Y ” with m0,0 = D5. More
precisely there is a Z/2-basis mi,j (i ≥ 0, j ≥ 0) of W 5 such that:

(1) m0,0 = D5.
(2) Xmi,j = mi−1,j or 0 according as i > 0 or i = 0.
(3) Y mi,j = mi,j−1 or 0 according as j > 0 or j = 0.

Similarly, W 1 has a basis adapted to X and Y with m0,0 = D.

Proof The ﬁrst result is [2], Corollary 4.13. And [2], Theorem 4.20 shows
that T5 : W 5 → W 1 is bijective, takes D5 to D and preserves the action of
Tp, p ≡ 1 (6). So we deduce the second result from the ﬁrst. ✷

Theorem 4.13
(a) K1/N1 has a basis adapted to X and Y with m0,0 = F .
(b) K5/N1 has a basis adapted to X and Y with m0,0 = F 2G.

Proof In the remark following the proof of [2], Theorem 2.17, we constructed
an isomorphism of N2/N1 with W = W 1 ⊕ W 5 which commutes with the
Tp, p > 3. This isomorphism takes F to D, F 2G to D5, K1/N1 to W 1 and
K5/N1 to W 5. So the results follow from Lemma 4.12. ✷

We now prove the main theorem—K (which by Theorem 4.6 consists of those
mod 2 modular forms of level Γ0(3) annihilated by U2 and U3 + I) has a basis
adapted to T7 and T13 with m0,0 = F + G, and as a consequence the Hecke
algebra attached to K is a power series ring in T7 and T13.

8

Note ﬁrst that pr 1 takes the element F + G of K to F . Then Theorem 4.13,
combined with Lemma 4.10, shows that K has a basis adapted to T7 and T13
with m0,0 = F + G. It also follows that K has the structure of Z/2[[X, Y ]]-
module with X and Y acting by T7 and T13, and that this action is faithful.
Now each Tp, p > 3, stabilizes K. It remains to show that Tp : K → K is
multiplication by some element of (X, Y ). Now Tp commutes with T7 and T13
and so is Z/2[[X, Y ]]-linear. The existence of an adapted basis for K then
shows (see the proof of [2], Theorem 4.16) that Tp : K → K is multiplication
by some u in Z/2[[X, Y ]]. Since Tp(m0,0) = Tp(F + G) = 0, u is in (X, Y ), and
we’re done.

We conclude this note by comparing two Hecke algebras. The inclusion of
K in N2 gives a map K → N2/N1 which is 1–1. The Tp, p > 3, act both
on K and N2/N1 and we have corresponding Hecke algebras HE(K) and
HE(N2/N1). The inclusion of K in N2/N1 gives an onto ring homomorphism
HE(N2/N1) → HE(K) taking Tp to Tp for all p > 3. Now in [2] we’ve shown
that HE(N2/N1) is a power series ring in T7 and T13 with an element ε of
square 0 adjoined, and that ε can be taken to be T5 + λ(T7, T13) for a certain
two-variable power series, λ. Since HE(K) is, as we’ve shown, a two-variable
power series ring, the kernel of HE(N2/N1) → HE(K) is a height 0 prime ideal
of HE(N2/N1) which can only be (ε). Let HE(N2/N1)red be the quotient of
HE(N2/N1) by its nilradical. We’ve shown:

Theorem 4.14 There is an isomorphism of HE(N2/N1)red with HE(K) tak-
ing Tp to Tp for each p > 3.

Remark Since ε annihilates K it annihilates the image of K in N2/N1. So
this image ⊂ ε · (N2/N1). It’s easy to see that the image is all of ε · (N2/N1).
