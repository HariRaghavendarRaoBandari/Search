Silicon oxide thin ﬁlms play an important role in the re-
alization of optical coatings and high-performance elec-
trical circuits. Estimates of the dielectric function in
the far- and mid-infrared regime are derived from the
observed transmittance spectrum for a commonly em-
ployed low-stress silicon oxide formulation. The exper-
imental, modeling, and numerical methods used to ex-
tract the dielectric function are presented. © 2016 Optical

Silicon oxide (SiOx) is widely employed as a dielectric
medium due to its low loss, insulating properties, and general
compatibility with optical coating and micro-fabrication pro-
cessing [1, 2]. Thin silicon monoxide ﬁlms have demonstrated
acceptable dielectric performance for high-frequency applica-
tions, as a dielectric medium [3]; however, the achievable loss
tangent is dependent on the deposition rate, annealing and trace
elemental constituents (H, C, OH, etc.) incorporated during
deposition, and subsequent use. From this perspective SiO1.5 is
a preferable stoichiometric composition in order to reduce the
number of free bonds and minimize the dielectric medium’s ab-
sorption [4]. The strength and details of the infrared bands are of
particular importance in determining the behavior of amorphous
solids such as silicate glasses. In the far-infrared the absorption
coefﬁcient of glasses is largely featureless, scales as the square of
frequency, and typically exceeds that of crystalline solid coun-
terparts by an order of magnitude due to optical coupling to
Debye-like and lattice modes [5]. These general features arise
in glasses from spatial and temporal disorder broadening of the
lattice absorption bands into a continuum. Here, the infrared
properties of low-stress silicon oxide ﬁlms are characterized and
compared to materials reported in the literature.

The amorphous silicon oxide ﬁlms were prepared by PECVD
(plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition) on H-terminated
100-mm Si(001) substrates. A 1000-W microwave plasma with a
2:1 O2:SiH4 gas ratio at 3.4 mT was used to grow the silicon oxide

and a 50-W RF bias was used to densify it. This process enabled
low-compressive-stress (< 200 MPa) ﬁlms critical for yielding
free-standing membranes. The resulting samples are consistent
with the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) throughput re-
quirements for optical characterization and use as a microwave
dielectric substrate [6]. Each silicon oxide membrane is a square
6.45 mm on a side and has a 12.75-mm-diameter Si frame. Each
wafer contains 19 samples. See insert in Fig. 1 for a photo of a
representative sample.

The silicon-oxide-coated side of the wafers was lithograph-
ically patterned with a street cut mask to deﬁne the perimeter
of the samples and the silicon oxide was reactive ion etched in
a CF4/CHF3/Ar plasma. The thickness, 1.020 µm, was deter-
mined with an α-SE spectroscopic ellipsometer using a calibrated
SiO2 thin-ﬁlm reference standard. The wafers were then wax
bonded to 100-mm Pyrex disks with Crystalbond-509. A pho-
toresist mask and deep reactive ion etching were used to deﬁne
the silicon oxide windows and frames with the Bosch process.
When the silicon oxide layer was exposed near the wafer edge,
the RF power used to etch the silicon was decreased from 600 W
to 400 W in order to minimize damage to the silicon oxide and
prevent the wax from reﬂowing. After release in acetone, the
intrinsic ﬁlm stress of the silicon oxide induced corrugations
along the membrane perimeter. Initial transmission measure-
ments of the samples revealed the presence of a resonance at
∼ 3600 cm−1, which indicated the presence of –OH or water in-
corporated in the ﬁlm [7]. The samples were annealed at 600◦C
for one hour in vacuum (1 × 10−8 Torr). The residual pressure of
H2 in the chamber increased ﬁftyfold momentarily at ∼ 400◦C
and then recovered to the background value. Annealing results
in a more quartz-like structure with an increase in the static
dielectric permittivity and an upward shift in the 10 µm line [8].
The transmission of a silicon oxide membrane was charac-
terized with a Bruker IFS 125 high-resolution FTS. The sample
was placed at a focus (∼ 1 mm diameter) in a f/6.5 focused
beam geometry in order to mitigate the inﬂuence of the ﬂatness
variations. The data repeatability was veriﬁed by measuring at
several positions. Three combinations of source, beamsplitter,
and detector were implemented to span the frequency band 30–
10,000 cm−1. In the far-infrared range a black polyethylene ﬁlter
was used to limit the thermal heat load on the bolometer. A red
blocking ﬁlter was used in the near-infrared range in conjunction
with the tungsten source to achieve a more balanced single-beam
intensity spectrum over the range of interest. Transmission data
from the three ranges agreed to within 0.5% in their regions of
overlap. The three datasets were merged into one spectrum by

using a weighted average (Fig. 1).

To interpret the observed response, the transmission spec-
trum was analyzed in terms of a classical dielectric function,
which physically relates the driving excitation to the material’s
electromagnetic response. In the infrared, the dielectric func-
tion response is speciﬁed by a series of resonances and line
shape proﬁles. Commonly used line shape proﬁles include the
Lorentzian, the Gaussian and their convolution (the Voigt) [9].
These real-valued proﬁles are valid in the optical regime, where
the frequency is approximately equal to the resonance frequency
and is large compared to the line width (ω ≈ ωT (cid:29) Γ). With the
appropriate symmetrizations, these dielectric functions satisfy
the Kramers-Kronig relations [10]. In the infrared, the Gaussian-
broadened complex damped harmonic oscillator (G-CDHO) has
greater ﬁdelity in reproducing the properties of amorphous di-
electric solids [11, 12] and metals [13]. In the latter case, a Drude
term (resonance at zero frequency) is added to describe the ﬁnite
conductivity in the medium. The formulation found in [12] is
plotted in Fig. 2. This convolved proﬁle better approximates
the line shape but fails in reproducing the proﬁle’s wings in
detail for amorphous materials. In addition, the resulting rela-
tive complex permittivity, ˆε, does not meet the parity require-
ments of the Kramers-Kronig relations and diverges to inﬁnity
as ω → 0 [14]. Mathematically, this occurs because ˆε is propor-
tional to (ω2 − iωΓ)−1/2. The resulting proﬁle has no adjustable
parameters to specify the scaling and amplitude of the dielectric
function as ω → 0. A ﬁnite sum of oscillators with Gaussian
weights [15] does not suffer from this fundamental limitation.
Here, the classical Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion

model [16] is used to reproduce the spectrum in Fig. 1:

In Eq. (1), ˆε(ω) is a frequency-dependent function of 4M + 2

meets the Kramers-Kronig causality criteria, i.e., the function is
analytic over the upper part of the complex plane, it converges
to a real constant for ω → ∞, and its real and imaginary compo-
nents are even and odd functions respectively [10]. As required
for a passive medium, the imaginary component, ε(cid:48)(cid:48), is positive
for ω > 0.

where αj allows interpolation between Lorentzian (αj = 0) and
Gaussian (αj > 0) wings [17]. The functional form of Eq. (1) sat-
isﬁes the requirements of causality and passivity of the Kramers-
Kronig relations [10], as shown in Fig. 2.

The impedance contrast between the sample and the vacuum
forms a Fabry-Perot resonator as can be seen in Fig. 1. The di-
electric function, Eq. (1), was used to model the measured power
transmission as a function of frequency and sample thickness,
h [24]. A non-linear least-squares ﬁt of the modeled transmis-
sion, T, to the laboratory data, TFTS, in Fig. 1 was performed by

Fig. 3. Real and imaginary components of the complex refractive index (black line) extracted from the measured transmittance. The
grey shaded line is indicative of the ∼ 3% error band propagated from the measured spectrum. Data from the literature [1, and
references therein] are overlaid for comparison (blue dots). Also included are data for fused quartz (red dashes) [18], UV-grade
fused silica (grey diamonds) and water-free fused silica (grey squares) [19]. The shaded boxes bound the scatter of the refractive and
absorption indices found in the microwave literature [2] and the SiOx data (red circles) from [20]. In the lower panel, low-frequency
dielectric function scaling laws are indicated by dotted lines. A divergence as ω−1/2 can occur in amorphous materials due to Debye
relaxation losses [21]. In non-conducting crystalline materials κ tends to increase as ω [22, 23]. The shaded gradient indicates the
region where the form for Γ(cid:48)(ω) adopted does not represent multiphonon processes.

Since the variables differ from each other by several orders of
magnitude, a scaling of the variables and constraints was per-
formed at each iteration to condition the problem and speed
convergence.

The modeled results for the transmission are shown in Fig. 1
laid over the measured data. The observed peak residual in the
transmission is less than 0.032 and the 3σ = 0.013 uncertainty
band indicated in Fig. 1 corresponds to the 99.7% conﬁdence
level under the assumption that the errors are uniform. The
systematic uncertainty in the spectrum has contributions aris-
ing from the change in illumination between the sample and
reference positions and the calibration of the differing FTS conﬁg-
urations. In analyzing the data, it was noted that the maximum
transmittance value was 1.0007. This can arise from internal
reﬂections in the instrument (≈ 0.005 amplitude, 3 cm−1 fringe
rate) leading to errors in the calibrated transmittance. To access
the potential inﬂuence of these systematics, the spectrum was
renormalized by 1.005 and reanalyzed. The dominant observed
effect was a ≈ 1% fractional change in the extracted ε(cid:48)
j in Table 1.
From a frequentist statistical perspective, 12 oscillators are
identiﬁed with the vibrational modes found in the literature
(Table 1). In principle, adding more resonators could enable
smaller residual errors in the modeled transmittance. For ex-
ample, when ﬁtting the data in Fig. 1 with the G-CDHO model,
17 oscillators were identiﬁed with residuals < 2%. However,
from a Bayesian standpoint [25] only 12 oscillators were statis-
tically justiﬁed. Therefore, in interpreting the data through a

model, overﬁtting the residuals between the model and the data
presents a concern. The residual features can migrate to the
absorption spectrum and give the impression that additional
sharp transitions exist [26].

The real and imaginary components, n and κ, of the complex
refractive index, ˆn, are shown in Fig. 3 and are computed from:

ˆε = ε

(cid:48) + i ε

(cid:48)(cid:48) = ˆn2 = (n + i κ)2 = (n2 − κ2) + i 2nκ,

(4)

where a nonmagnetic permeability µr = 1 is adopted. For the
interpretation of the FTS data of low-loss materials, ˆn is the pre-
ferred parameterization to prevent contamination of the imagi-
nary component of the dielectric function [19]. Figure 3 shows
a comparison of the values of n and κ with data from the liter-
ature [1, and references therein]. This is augmented with data
from [2, 18–20, 22, 23]. The variability between the literature
data is signiﬁcant and can be traced to the different stoichiomet-
ric compositions, sample purity and experimental techniques; in
some cases the description provided is inadequate to inform a
detailed comparison.

The measured FTS data (Fig. 1) do not highly constrain the
complex refractive index below 0.8 THz and above 100 THz.
However, it is useful to consider the behavior of the dielectric
function outside the range where the modeled data are valid
in Fig. 3. For amorphous dielectric materials, in the limit of
ω → 0, a Debye term is typically required to account for the
polarization relaxation mechanism or, more generally, a univer-
sal response associated with the presence of very-low-energy

excitations in the medium [21]. For ω greater than the highest
infrared transverse optical mode, the absorption is dominated by
multiphonon processes [31, 32]. This effect is not addressed in
the model deﬁned by Eq. (1) and can be seen as an excess in the
proﬁle wings above ∼ 50 THz (see shaded region in Fig. 3). With
spectral data spanning the transmission window, the approach
described in [33] can be employed to uniquely parameterize and
represent this detail.

The properties of a low-stress silicon oxide ﬁlm suitable for
microwave and terahertz applications have been presented and
contrasted with other variations reported in the literature. The
symmetry properties and limitations of the G-CDHO and the
Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude models have been discussed in the
context of the Kramers-Kronig relations. The dielectric param-
eters reported here are representative of low-stress SiOx mem-
branes encountered in our fabrication and test efforts.
