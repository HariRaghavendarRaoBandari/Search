ABSTRACT
We compare covering factors of circumnuclear dusty obscurers in radio-loud and radio-quiet
quasars. The radio-loud quasars are represented by a sample of FR II quasars obtained by
cross-matching a catalog of the FR II radio sources selected by van Velzen et al. with the SDSS
DR7 catalog of quasars. Covering factors of FR II quasars are compared with covering factors
of the radio-quiet quasars matched with them in redshift, black hole mass, and Eddington-
ratio. We found that covering factors, proxied by the infrared-to-bolometric luminosity ratio,
are on average slightly smaller in FR II quasars than in radio-quiet quasars. For both samples,
no statistically signiﬁcant dependence of a median covering factor on Eddington ratio, black
hole mass, nor redshift can be claimed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Discovery of broad lines and strong non-stellar continuum in
polarized light of Seyfert 2 galaxies (Antonucci & Miller 1985;
Miller & Goodrich 1987) and thermal IR excesses (Miley et al.
1985; Edelson et al. 1987) led to idea about existence in AGN of
dusty, molecular tori (Krolik & Begelman 1988). This allowed to
unify Seyfert 2 galaxies (only narrow lines and weak or absent
non-stellar continuum) with Seyfert 1 galaxies (broad emission
lines and strong non-stellar continuum). The dusty tori were pro-
posed also to unify narrow-line radio galaxies with radio-loud (RL)
quasars and broad-line radio galaxies (Barthel 1989), and discovery
of radio-quiet (RQ) quasars of type 2 (Reyes et al. 2008 and refs.
therein) conﬁrmed the presence of dusty obscurers in RQ quasars
as well.

As indicated by the number ratio of the type 2 AGN to the
type 1 AGN, and, independently, by the infrared-to-UV luminos-
ity ratio, these tori are geometrically thick. They are predicted
to have inner edge at the sublimation radius (Rees et al. 1969;
Barvainis 1987) and are likely enclosed within the BH inﬂuence
sphere (Hopkins et al. 2012 and refs. therein). Location of the in-
ner edge at the sublimation radius is conﬁrmed by reverberation
mappings (e.g. Koshida et al. 2014) and by near-IR interferome-
try (Kishimoto et al. 2012), while constraints on their spatial exten-
sions are suggested by the mid-IR interferometry (Burtscher et al.
2013; López-Gonzaga et al. 2016). Hence, studies of such tori pro-
vide excellent opportunity to probe the conditions of the outer-
most portions of the BH accretion ﬂows. Unfortunately, physical

and dynamical structure of dusty tori is still not known (see re-
view by Netzer 2015). It is even uncertain, whether they are really
tori, or maybe the tori are just mimicked by optically thick por-
tions of disk winds (e.g. Emmering et al. 1992; Königl & Kartje
1994; Elitzur & Shlosman 2006) or by warped, tilted accretion
disks (Lawrence & Elvis 2010 and refs. therein). One might try to
resolve the real structure of the dusty region by modeling spectra
of IR radiation resulting from reprocessing of optical/UV central
radiation. However, due to the complexity of these models, the ob-
served spectra can be reproduced by many of them with a broad
choice of the adopted model parameters (Netzer et al. 2015).

Regardless of the uncertainties in the ‘torus’ structure, us-
ing the mid-IR spectra one can at least study the fraction of the
central radiation that is reprocessed by circumnuclear dust (R ≡
LMIR/Lbol), in particular its distribution and dependence on the Ed-
dington ratio (λE ≡ Lbol/LEdd) and black hole mass (MBH). Noting
that luminous RQ and RL quasars cover similar ranges of these pa-
rameters, by comparing above properties in these two quasar pop-
ulations one may try to verify whether the conditions in their outer
accretion disks are diﬀerent, as one might expect in case of having
accretion triggered by mergers in RL quasars and by secular pro-
cesses in RQ quasars (Chiaberge et al. 2015), and/or having accre-
tion ﬂows characterized by higher magnetization in the RL quasars
as compared with the RQ ones. Obviously, if existing, the largest
diﬀerence in the R should be noticed between the RQ quasars and
the most RL ones. Hence, unlike in similar studies performed by
Ma & Wang (2013), our RQ quasar sample was chosen to be repre-
sented only by quasars with FRII radio-morphology. Furthermore,
in order to exclude possible diﬀerentiating eﬀects coming from dif-
ferent BH masses, Eddington-ratios, and redshifts, we perform such
comparison by respective pairings of RL and RQ quasars. First,
when deriving dependence of R on λE , we pair each RL quasar

2

Gupta et al.

with a RQ one with the same redshift and black hole masses Sec-
ond, when studying dependence of R on the black hole mass, we
pair quasars with the same redshift and λE. Third, when studying
dependence of R on the redshift, we pair quasars with the same λE
and black hole mass.

Our work is organized as follows: in §2 we deﬁne our data
samples, in §3 the methods of calculation of R and pairing proce-
dures are described, in §4 results of our studies of covering factors
of dusty obscurers in FR II vs. RQ quasars are presented, and in §5
they are discussed in the context of the radio diversity of quasars.
We adopted Λ cold dark matter cosmology, with H0 = 70km s−1,
Ωm = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7.

2 DATA SAMPLES

2.1 FR II quasars

We compile the sample of RL quasars with FR II radio morphol-
ogy (Fanaroﬀ & Riley 1974) by cross-matching the sample of FR II
radio sources identiﬁed by van Velzen et al. (2015) in the Faint Im-
ages of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) catalog with
the quasars from SDSS DR7 quasar catalog (Schneider et al. 2010).
The resulting sample of FR II quasars was then matched with the
sample of SDSS DR7 quasars detected by the Wide-ﬁeld Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE) (Wu et. al. 2012). This gave us 895 FR II
quasars detected in the MIR band.

2.2 Radio-quiet quasars

The RQ sample with MIR data is constructed from the Wu et. al.
(2012) sample by removing the sample the FR II quasars selected
above and those quasars which have FIRST (Becker et al. 1995)
and NVSS (Condon et al. 1998) radio detections. We also removed
those objects that were outside the FIRST observation region. This
gave us 92445 RQ quasars with MIR detections.

2.3 Additional sample criteria

As it is stated in §3, we calculate the MID infrared luminosity, using
the ﬂux measured in the WISE/W3 window (λ ≃ 12 µm). In order
to avoid having this window too close to the short-wavelength edge
of the MIR band in the quasar rest frame, we limit our samples to
z < 2. We also introduce a limit on black hole masses, taking only
quasars with MBH > 108M⊙. This is in order to avoid Seyfert galax-
ies, in which the MIR ﬂux can have a signiﬁcant contribution from
starbursts. Furthermore, putting limits on redshift and black hole
mass reduces biases imposed on studied properties by selection ef-
fects related to the ﬂux limits. Finally, we constrain our samples
to the objects with the Eddington-ratio λE > 0.01 to assure that
accretion ﬂows in the selected objects are radiatively eﬃcient. Af-
ter applying all these limits we end-up with 797 FR II quasars and
67480 RQ quasars.

In Figure 1 we show the histograms of our RL and RQ samples
as a function of redshift z, black hole mass MBH/M⊙, and Eddington
radio λE.

3 METHODS

3.1 Covering factor

There are two main methods to derive covering factors of dusty, cir-
cumnuclear obscurers, using number ratio of type 1 to type 2 AGNs

Figure 1. Distributions of our RL and RQ samples of quasars in redshift z,
black hole mass MBH/M⊙, and Eddington radio λE = Lbol/LEdd.

or using ratio of the MIR luminosity to the bolometric luminos-
ity (see review by Netzer 2015). Both methods suﬀer from several
drawbacks, the former because of diﬃculties to assure the com-
mon parent AGN population and because of having dependence of
N2/N1 on the covering factor distributions (Ramos Almeida et al.
2011; Elitzur 2012), the latter because derivation of the covering
factor from LMIR/Lbol requires knowledge of anisotropy of accre-
tion disk and obscurer radiation, and those are model dependent.
In this paper we will assume that the covering factor is simply
equal to R ≡ LMIR/Lbol, which corresponds with assumption of
isotropic radiation of both components. Whiles quantitatively this
may lead to large systematic departures from real values of cover-
ing factors (see, e.g. Calderone et al. 2012 ), as long as our main
interest is to verify whether dusty obscurers in RL and RQ quasars
are diﬀerent, using R is not expected to aﬀect studied by us trends.
We calculate R taking Lbol from Shen et al. (2011) and LMIR us-
ing formula LMIR = 12.5 × (νW3Lν,W3), where νW3 = 1013.4 Hz,
Lν,W3 = 4πd2
LFν,W3, log Fν,W3 = −(5.174 + mW3)/2.5, and mW3 mag-
nitudes are provided by Wu et. al. (2012), denoted in Table 1 as
‘W3’.

Our choice of using WISE/W3 data to calculate LMIR can be

justiﬁed by noting that:

• circumnuclear dust spectra in the AGN rest frames are approx-
imately ﬂat, i.e., with a spectral index αMIR ≃ 1 (α : Fν ∝ ν−αMIR)
and enclosed between 2µm and 25µm (Hönig et al. 2011; Netzer
2015);

• for redshifts z > 1.3 the W1 and W2 bands move in the quasar

rest frame to λE < 2µm;

• W4 ﬂuxes have much larger S/N than in other channels, hence
calculating LMIR by using spectral slopes between separated by less
than factor two νW2 and νW3 may create much larger errors than
using only W3 ﬂux and adopting αMIR = 1.

3.2 Pair Matching

(2010) and Wild et. al.

We use a matching technique used in Kauﬀmann et. al.
(2008),Masters et. al.
(2010) instead of
globally comparing the properties of the RL and RQ samples with
diﬀerent distributions of black hole mass or redshift. In order to
study the dependence of R on any of the three parameters λE,
MBH or z, each RL quasar is associated with the same number n
of RQ quasars according to their matching distance calculated for
the other two parameters. First, candidate RQ counterparts are se-
lected from the following range: |∆ log λE | < 0.09, |∆z| < 0.01 and
|∆ log MBH| < 0.12. Second, we calculate the matching distances
between the RL quasar and the RQ candidates deﬁned as d2
match =
Pi ∆2
i , where ∆i stands for either ∆ log λE, ∆z or ∆ log(MBH/M⊙).
Then, we select only those RQ candidates which have the shortest
matching distance dmatch. We have considered diﬀerent numbers of
paired RQ quasars with n = 1, 3, 10. This process of matching can
result in the same RQ quasar paired with more than one RL ones.
Then, the sample of RL quasars, and the subsample of paired
RQ quasars, are divided according to the studied parameter into
several bins containing equal numbers of sources. For example,
in order to study the dependence of R on λE, we divide the sam-
ples in the bins of λE, and then we pair the quasars in MBH and
z according to the matching distance given by d2
match = (∆z)2 +
[∆ log(MBH/M⊙)]2.

4 RESULTS

Figure 2 compares the overall normalized distributions of R for RL
and RQ quasars that are paired in z, MBH and λE with n = 3. We
have overlaid the cumulative distributions of the two samples. The
typical values of R for both RL and RQ quasars are in the range
0.1 − 0.6. The histograms peak at Rpeak ≃ 0.25, with Rpeak being
slightly higher for the RQ quasars. The mean values of R are 0.28
for RQ quasars and 0.32 for RL quasars, and the median values are
0.25 and 0.29, respectively.

In Figure 3 and Figure 4 we show the distributions of R vs.
either λE, MBH or z for the paired samples of RL and RQ quasars.
Table 2 reports the median values R50, as well as ﬁrst and third quar-
tiles R25 and R75 for diﬀerent bins of λE, corresponding to the left
panel of Figure 3. There is no overall trend that we see in the distri-
bution of R. The diﬀerence in R between RL and RQ increases with

the increase in λE, z, and MBH. This trend remains the same, irre-
spective of the number of matches being n = 1, 3, 10, and whether
the bins are equally spaced or contain equal number of objects. We
also observe that R25 and R75 indicate broad distributions of R for
every λE, MBH and z. Therefore, variations in the median values do
not appear to be signiﬁcant.

Figure 5 shows the cumulative distributions of R for the sam-
ples shown in Figure 3 divided according to λE into bins containing
equal number of objects. In order to evaluate whether there are sta-
tistical diﬀerences between the distributions of R for RL and RQ
samples, we make use of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test (K-S test). Table 3 shows the D-values and p-values of each
bin. For a broad range of λE values, the values of p range between
0.001 and 0.15, indicating that the diﬀerence between the distribu-
tions of R are not very signiﬁcant. However, for the highest values

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

While the main factor determining the radiative eﬃciency of accre-
tion ﬂows in AGN is the accretion rate normalized by the black hole
mass (equivalently, the accretion-rate Eddington ratio ˙Mc2/LE),
the eﬃciency of jet production covers 3-4 orders of magnitude at
any Eddington ratio (Sikora et al. 2007). This is particularly well
documented in the case of quasars, in which radio-loudness, de-
ﬁned to be the radio-to-optical luminosity ratio (Kellermann et al.
1989), can be monitored down to lowest values of radio lumi-
nosity associated with jet activity. (Kimball et al. 2011). However
like in X-ray BH binaries the AGN jet activity is common only
at low-rate, radiatively ineﬃcient accretion ﬂows. At larger accre-
tion rates, the jet production is typically very suppressed. This is
evidenced by having only ∼ 10% of quasars associated with ra-
dio sources powered by jets, and only about 2% developing lumi-
nous, extended FRII radio structures (White et al. 2007). In order
to explain the existence of RL quasars and their rarity, one might
consider an intermittency of jet production at high accretion rates
and its low duty cycle. Such intermittency have been proposed to
be driven by stochastic switches between two accretion modes, one
driven by viscosity and another led by removing angular momen-

tum via MHD outﬂows (Livio et al. 2003; Körding et al. 2006).
However, noting the 107 − 108-year lifetimes of FRII radio sources
(Bird et al. 2008; Antognini et al. 2012, and refs. therein), the rarity
of FRII quasars might imply that the RQ quasar lifetimes are longer
than the Salpeter timescale (Salpeter 1964). Furthermore, spec-
tral properties of RQ and RL quasars are strikingly similar in all
bands but radio (Sanders et al. 1989; Francis et al. 1993; Elvis et al.
1994; Zheng et al. 1997; Telfer et al. 2002; Richards et al. 2006;
de Vries et al. 2006; Shang et al. 2011; Shankar et al. 2016). This
suggests that production of powerful jets may not be related to
some exceptional accretion mode, and seems to favor powering of
jets by rotating black holes (Blandford & Znajek 1977). In such a
case, the jet power scales roughly with the square of the BH spin
and magnetic ﬂux threading the BH horizon Lj ∝ a2ΦBH. While
value of the spin a is largely determined by cosmological evo-
lution of BHs that involves multiple accretion and merger events
(Volonteri et al. 2013), the magnetic ﬂux ΦBH is built up on black
hole by advection of a poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. If accumulation of
the magnetic ﬂux proceeds during the quasar phase, one might ex-
pect weaker magnetization of the accretion ﬂows in RQ quasars
than in RL quasars. Since the magnetization level of accretion ﬂow
may aﬀect the covering factor of dusty obscurer (e.g., when obscu-
ration is provided by magnetized winds), such magnetic diﬀerenti-
ation of accretion ﬂows in their outermost portions can be veriﬁed
by studies of a fraction of AGN optical/UV radiation reprocessed
by dust to IR radiation.

Until now, most studies of dust covering factor were per-
formed separately for RL and RQ quasars, and focused on their
dependence on luminosity, rather than on Eddington ratio. The only
work to our knowledge which provides direct comparison of cov-
ering factors in RL and RQ quasars, and their dependence on Ed-
dington ratio and BH mass, is the one by Ma & Wang (2013). No
signiﬁcant diﬀerences of these properties between the two quasar
populations have been found. We performed a similar study, but in
order to have a larger radio-loudness contrast between the RL and
RQ samples, we limited the RL quasar sample only to those associ-
ated with FRII morphology that are known to be on average much

MNRAS 000, 1–6 (2016)

radio-louder than the entire, radio detected population of quasars
(Lu et al. 2007). Furthermore, in order to avoid the potential eﬀect
of diﬀerent black hole masses and source distances on the studied
properties of RL vs. RQ quasars, we compared their covering fac-
tors by including only those RQ quasars, that match the RL ones in
redshift, black hole mass and Eddington ratio.

Our main results can be summarized as follows:

• Median covering factors (proxied by R) of FR II quasars and
RQ quasars matched in (z; MBH; λE) are comparable (R50,RL = 0.28
and R50,RQ = 0.31), both having very similar, fully overlapped
broad distributions;

• Dependencies of the median covering factors on the Edding-
ton ratio, black hole mass and redshift are statistically weak. While
very similar at lowest values of z, MBH and λE), they diverge some-
what at the highest values of these parameters, with a trend of the
median of RRL decreasing with both λE and MBH, and the median
of RRQ increasing with redshift.

Very similar covering factors of dusty obscurers in FR II
and RQ quasars suggest similar accretion conditions on parsec
scales. Furthermore, the lack of statistically signiﬁcant depen-
dence of CFs on the Eddington ratio down to values λE < 0.03
(found also by Ma & Wang 2013) excludes the possibility that
dusty obscurers could be associated with the winds powered by
radiation pressure exerted on dust. On the other hand, recent in-
terferometric MIR observations (López-Gonzaga et al. 2016) in-
dicate possible elongation of the dusty obscurers in the direc-
tion corresponding to the AGN polar axis (as determined by OIII
line cones and/or jets), rather than in the equatorial plane. This
would indicate outﬂows/winds as the loci of dust reprocessing
AGN radiation into MIR. Such outﬂows might be powered mag-
netically as suggested by Emmering et al. (1992), Königl & Kartje
(1994) and Elitzur & Shlosman (2006). The elongated geome-
try of dusty obscurers is also supported by the fact that scat-
tering cones in quasars are much narrower than predicted by
torus models (Obied et al. 2016). Signiﬁcant magnetization of
the accretion ﬂows is independently supported by the fact that

6

Gupta et al.

contribution of magnetic ﬁelds to vertical pressure in accretion
disks can protect them against their gravitational fragmentation
(Begelman & Pringle 2007; Salvesen et al. 2016). However, simi-
lar covering factors of dusty obscurers in RQ and RL quasars in-
dicate that magnetization of accretion ﬂows in RL quasars is not
stronger than in RQ quasars. We can envisage two scenarios for
reconciling this similarity with models involving the Blandford-
Znajek mechanism, according to which eﬃciency of jet produc-
tion strongly depends on the magnetic ﬂux. They are: (1) accu-
mulation of the magnetic ﬂux prior to the quasar phase, which
may depend strongly on the environment conditions (Sikora et al.
2013; Sikora & Begelman 2013); (2) magnetic ﬂux accumulation
during the quasar phase, in which case the amount of accumulated
ﬂux can on average be much larger in RL quasars if their lifetime
is much longer than the lifetime of RQ quasars (Schawinski et al.
2015). Obviously, noting that only few nearby AGNs were imaged
by MIR interferometry, it remains uncertain how representative are
these objects for the entire AGN population. Noting the ambiguity
of models that can successfully reproduce the observed IR spectra
(Netzer 2015), better understanding of the dusty obscurer structure
will need to wait for the next generation of the MIR interferometers
(e.g. Lopez et al. 2014).
