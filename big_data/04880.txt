ABSTRACT

Keane et al. (2016) have recently reported the discovery of a new fast radio burst, FRB150418, with a promising
radio counterpart at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz – a rapidly decaying source, falling from 200-300 µJy to 100 µJy on timescales of
∼6 d. This transient source may be associated with an elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.492, providing the ﬁrst ﬁrm
spectroscopic redshift for a FRB and the ability to estimate the density of baryons in the intergalactic medium via
the combination of known redshift and radio dispersion of the FRB. An alternative explanation is that the putative
counterpart’s variation may instead be extrinsic, caused by refractive scintillation in the ionized interstellar medium
of the Milky Way, which would invalidate the association with FRB150418. We examine this latter explanation in
detail and show that the reported observations are consistent with scintillating radio emission from the core of a radio-
loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) having a brightness temperature Tb (cid:38) 109 K. Using numerical simulations of the
expected scattering for the line of sight to FRB150418, we provide example images and light curves of such an AGN
at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz. These results can be compared with continued radio monitoring to conclusively determine the
importance of scintillation for the observed radio variability, and they show that scintillation is a critical consideration
for continued searches for FRB counterparts at radio wavelengths.

INTRODUCTION

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly-dispersed radio
transients emitting a radio ﬂux density of ∼1 Jy for only
a few milliseconds or less. Since the ﬁrst discovery re-
ported in 2007 (Lorimer et al. 2007), more than 17 FRBs2
(Petroﬀ et al. 2016) have been discovered with the Parkes
Radio telescope (e.g. Lorimer et al. 2007; Keane et al.
2012, 2016), the Arecibo observatory (Spitler et al. 2014,
2016), and the Green Bank telescope (Masui et al. 2015).
This population of FRBs is highly inhomogeneous, with
some showing high circular polarization (Petroﬀ et al.
2015), others showing high linear polarization (Masui
et al. 2015), and others with little polarization (Keane
et al. 2016). Although most detected FRBs are isolated
events, one source has recently been found to be repeat-
ing (Spitler et al. 2016).
The origin of the FRBs remains uncertain. Their large
dispersion measures, ∼400 − 1600 cm−3 pc, exceed ex-
pected values for propagation in the interstellar medium,
suggesting that FRBs are extragalactic at redshifts of
z ∼ 0.5 − 1. An extragalactic pulsed signal enables a
direct probe of properties of the intergalactic medium
(IGM) through the cold plasma dispersion relationship,
just as pulsars are used to probe the ionized interstel-
lar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way. The short dura-
tions and extreme brightness temperatures of FRBs sug-
gest compact progenitors, such as the magnetars (e.g.
Lyubarsky 2014), neutron stars (e.g. Totani 2013; Fal-
cke & Rezzolla 2014; Zhang 2014), white-dwarfs (e.g.
Kashiyama et al. 2013), and black holes (e.g. Keane et al.
2012), although the repeating FRB is incompatible with
the many proposed cataclysmic events.

Recently, Keane et al. (2016) (hereafter K16) reported
the discovery of a new FRB (FRB150418) followed by a
slower radio transient detected with the Australia Tele-
scope Compact Array (ATCA). The radio light curves of
this transient (hereafter J0716-1900) at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz
show rapid decay on timescales of ∼6 d. Optical obser-
vations with Subaru found that J0716-1900 is associated
with the elliptical galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2 at
the redshift of 0.492±0.008. If this galaxy is indeed asso-
ciated with FRB150418, then its identiﬁcation provides
the ﬁrst measured redshift of a FRB. The dispersion mea-
sure of the FRB then provides an estimate of the density
of the IGM, in this case giving a value consistent with
the standard ΛCDM cosmology.

However,

scintillation in the ionized interstellar
medium can also introduce rapid variability of compact
radio sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs), pul-
sars and masers (see; e.g. Rickett et al. 1984; Rickett
1990; Narayan 1992; Lovell et al. 2008). Moreover, be-
cause the line of sight to FRB150418 lies close to the
Galactic plane (Galactic latitude b ≈ −3.2◦), it has scat-
tering that is signiﬁcantly stronger than that at larger
latitudes. Consequently, as noted by K16, the eﬀects of
scintillation are signiﬁcant for this FRB and other nearby
compact sources and must be considered as a potential
source of the rapidly varying counterpart. If the varia-
tions seen in J0716-1900 is indeed extrinsic, caused by
scintillating emission from a compact galactic nucleus,
then its association with FRB150418 is likely spurious.
In this Letter, we study the role of interstellar scin-

we brieﬂy introduce the theory of the interstellar scat-
tering and give expected scattering properties along the
line of sight to FRB150418. Then, we present theoreti-
cal simulations based on these quantities in §3. Finally,

of FRB150418 and general considerations for follow-up
of future FRBs in §4. Throughout the Letter, we use
a ΛCDM cosmology with h = 0.705, Ωm = 0.228 and
ΩΛ = 0.726 (Komatsu et al. 2009), providing the lumi-
nosity distance and linear scale of 2808 Mpc and 6.1 pc
mas−1 for J0716-1900, respectively.

2. SCATTERING AND SCINTILLATION OF J0716-1900

2.1. Scattering Theory

Scattering of radio waves in the interstellar plasma
arises from ﬂuctuations in electron density.
In many
instances, the properties of scattering can be well de-
scribed by a single, thin phase-changing screen ϕ(x),
where x is a transverse coordinate on the screen. The
statistical characteristics of the scattering and scintilla-
tion can then be related to statistical characteristics of
the phase ﬂuctuations through a spatial structure func-
tion Dϕ(x) = (cid:104)[ϕ(x + x0) − ϕ(x0)]2(cid:105)x0 . A variety of
measurements ﬁnd that the density ﬂuctuations corre-
spond to a turbulent cascade giving rise to a power-law
structure function, Dϕ(x) ∝ |x|α from the inner scale of
∼102 km to the outer scale of (cid:29)1 AU, with α close to the
value of 5/3 expected for three-dimensional Kolmogorov
turbulence (Armstrong et al. 1995).

The Fresnel scale, rF ≡(cid:113) λD

The properties of the scattering screen are character-
ized by a pair of length scales. The phase coherence
length (or diﬀractive scale), r0 ∝ λ−2/α, decreases with
increasing observing wavelength λ and determines the
scale at which the screen phase decorrelates: Dϕ(r0) ≡ 1.
2π , depends on the distance D
from the observer to the scattering screen and determines
how the geometrical phase of propagation varies across
the screen. For radio observations, interstellar scattering
is usually in the strong scattering regime, correspond-
ing to the condition r0 (cid:28) rF (i.e., Dϕ(rF) (cid:29) 1), and
a third scale becomes important: the refractive scale,
F/r0 ∝ λ1+2/α, which determines the size of the
rR = r2
scattered image of the point source.
Scintillation in strong scattering is dominated by two
distinct branches, diﬀractive and refractive, on these
widely separated scales. Diﬀractive scintillation, arising
from ﬂuctuations on scales of r0, is quenched by a source
exceeding the scale of r0. As a result, diﬀractive scintil-
lation is typically quenched by AGN. Refractive scintil-
lation arises from ﬂuctuations on scales of rR and is only
quenched by a source exceeding the scale of rR so can
persist for compact AGN. With the characteristic trans-
verse velocity of the scattering material v⊥, the diﬀrac-
tive and refractive timescales are given by t0 ≡ r0/v⊥
and tR ≡ rR/v⊥. For pulsars, v⊥ ∼ 107 cm s−1 is typical
(e.g. Cordes et al. 1988; Rickett 1990).

The ﬂux variability due to the scattering eﬀects is
often quantiﬁed with the modulation index, deﬁned by
ν (cid:105) − (cid:104)Fν(cid:105)2/(cid:104)Fν(cid:105), where Fν is the ﬂux density.
For refractive scintillation, the modulation index for a
source with angular size θsrc smaller than θscatt (i.e., the
refractive scale) is m ≈ (r0/rF)2−α, where the precise
prefactor is of order unity (e.g. Goodman & Narayan
1985; Narayan 1992). Larger sources suppress the mod-
ulation index by a factor of (θscatt/θsrc)2−α/2, where θsrc
is the unscattered source size.

2.2. Expected Scattering Properties for J0716-1900
One can estimate characteristic quantities in §2.1 for
J0716-1900 with the Galactic free electron density model,
NE20013 (Cordes & Lazio 2002, 2003). For this model,
the expected FWMH scattering size along the line of
sight to J0716-1900 is θscatt,1GHz = 4.5 mas at 1 GHz.
Due to its low Galactic latitude, this value is signiﬁcantly
higher than the median angular broadening at 1 GHz
(∼1 mas). Other scattering parameters can then be es-
timated as follows:

In Table 1, we give characteristic quantities for a screen
at D = 1 kpc at 1, 5.5 and 7.5 GHz, assuming a canonical
velocity of v⊥ = 5 × 106 cm s−1 and power-law index of
α = 5/3.

The most important implication from Table 1 is that
J0716-1900 can be highly aﬀected by refractive scatter-
ing at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz, if the source is more compact
than ∼0.1 mas (corresponding to a distance of ∼ 0.6 pc
at the redshift of z = 0.492). This upper-limit is reason-
able for the radio core of a relativistic jet (e.g. Horiuchi
et al. 2004). Refractive scattering would then cause mod-

ulation of ∼30% on a timescale of a few days, similar to
what has been observed.

Thus, in addition to the importance of scintillation for
the radio variability a compact afterglow, as noted by
K16, refractive scintillation is also a critical consideration
even for compact emission from an AGN, and the radio
variability of J0716-1900 is comparable to the expected
refractive scintillation in the ISM. Note also that the
pulse broadening due to the interstellar scintillation is
only ∼0.02 ms at 1 GHz, which is much shorter than the
observed pulse duration of 0.8 ± 0.3 ms for FRB150418
(K16).

3. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

To further study the radio-ﬂux variation caused by the
interstellar scintillation and understand how the varia-
tions may be correlated at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz, we per-
formed numerical simulations of the scattering of J0716-
1900. Following Johnson & Gwinn (2015), we gener-
ated scattered images at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz for an intrinsic
source that was a circular Gaussian with a full-width-at-
half-maximum (FWHM) size of 0.1 mas.4 We generated
a scattering screen with 214 × 214 random phases with
the characteristic scattering parameters given in Table 1.
Our simulations span 1207 d (∼ 300-600 tR) with a time
resolution of 0.27 d ((cid:28) tR). To investigate the variabil-
ity statistics, we also generated ∼ 200 diﬀerent scattering
realizations, providing a total span of ∼ 2 × 105 d. We
show example images of the scattered structure for one
instance of one scattering realization in Fig. 1. We cal-
culated the total ﬂux density of each scattered image at
each time to generate a light curve for each frequency.

In Figure 2, we show simulated light curves at 5.5 and
7.5 GHz, and in Figure 3 we show the probability distri-
bution for the simulated light curves. The light curves
exhibit the expected fast variability discussed in §2.2.
The modulation index is ∼29% and ∼25% for the whole
data at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz, respectively, consistent with the
original observations of the ATCA (K16) and also with
the follow-up observations with the Very Large Array
(VLA) (Williams et al. 2016; Vedantham et al. 2016).
For direct comparison with these observations, we also
compare light curves for 350 d with the normalized light
curve of K16, Williams et al. (2016) and Vedantham et al.
(2016) in Fig. 2(b). The simulated light curves vary on
scales of ∼ 3 − 5 d, consistent with all observations, and
have highly correlated variability at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz,
again consistent with the synchronized ﬂux variation re-
ported by K16. Refractive scintillation can also explain
the gentle spectral modulation across 2-18 GHz reported
by Vedantham et al. (2016).

4. THE ORIGIN OF J0716-1900

We have shown that refractive scattering can poten-
tially explain the amplitude and timescale of the radio
variations of J0716-1900. This explanation requires that
the source is suﬃciently compact, most plausibly a weak,
radio-loud AGN. Here, we brieﬂy discuss expected obser-
vational properties for this scenario.

4 Because the scattering has deterministic frequency dependence,
a single scattering screen determines the scattered image at all
frequencies.

Pν = 9.4 × 1022 W Hz−1 ×

(1)
This power is consistent with the typical nuclear radio
power of the nearby low luminosity AGNs (LLAGN) and
elliptical galaxies (e.g. Doi et al. 2011) that are thought
to be powered by a hot accretion ﬂow (e.g. Yuan &
Narayan 2014) or a faint jet (e.g. Falcke et al. 2004).
This radio power is also consistent with the low-power
end of the known blazars (Liuzzo et al. 2013; Massaro
et al. 2015).
To avoid quenching the refractive scintillation, the
source angular size must subtend θsrc (cid:46) 0.1 mas, pro-
viding a lower limit on its brightness temperature:

The lower limit of the brightness temperature is compati-
ble with low-power radio galaxies and blazars (e.g. Liuzzo
et al. 2009, 2013; Piner & Edwards 2014). Thus, in addi-
tion to the source size, the radio power and the brightness
temperature are also reasonable as nuclear emission from
a LLAGN, low-powered blazar, or weak AGN.

We note that Vedantham et al. (2016) have very re-
cently measured a ﬂat radio spectrum for J0716-1900,
which is generally seen in blazars (e.g. Massaro et al.
2014). The ﬂat radio spectrum suggests that the major-
ity of the arcsecond-scale ﬂux density originates in the
optically-thick radio core emission, which could be suf-
ﬁciently compact to be scintillating, and other observa-
tions have revealed the presence of compact jet struc-
ture in elliptical galaxies without any feature of AGN in
the optical/infrared spectrum (e.g. Akiyama et al. 2016).
Thus, the radio spectrum supports the scenario in which
the variability J0716-1900 in predominantly from inter-
stellar scintillation.

Williams & Berger (2016) have also argued that the
radio emission from J0716-1900 may arise from an AGN
and have noted that the observed variability is incompat-
ible with standard afterglow evolution. Based on the deep
VLA imaging study of Fomalont et al. (1991) at 5 GHz,
Williams & Berger (2016) further note that ∼16 sources
above 100 µJy are expected per Parkes beam. Moreover,
Fomalont et al. (1991) found that most sources between
60− 1000 µJy were unresolved (<1.5(cid:48)(cid:48)). These estimates
are then favorable for ascribing the variability of J0716-
1900 to refractive scintillation. However, we caution that
the variability of J0716-1900 should not be directly com-
pared with variability reported in other surveys at these
frequencies because its line of sight is close to the Galac-
tic plane and so has signiﬁcantly stronger scattering than
the median Galactic values. Consequently, the transition
to weak scattering, where the refractive modulation in-
dex m peaks, is at higher frequencies for J0716-1900 than
for higher-latitude sources.

In short, the fast variation of J0716-1900 can be rea-
sonably explained as refractive scintillation in the ISM
and may not represent an afterglow associated with
FRB150418. Both the analytical theory of refractive
scattering and our numerical simulations show that the
expected scattering of J0716-1900 can reproduce the
observed timescales and modulation index at 5.5 and
7.5 GHz. They also naturally explain the synchronized
modulation at these frequencies and the gentle modula-
tion across the wider radio spectrum reported by Vedan-
tham et al. (2016). Refractive scintillation requires that
the source size is smaller that (cid:46)0.1 mas ((cid:46)0.6 pc at
the source), corresponding to a brightness temperature
Tb > 109 K, compatible with LLAGN and faint blazars.
Our results would also apply to more compact emission,
such as an FRB afterglow, and demonstrate that fast
variability does not necessitate a high Doppler factor.

Our estimates of the scattering are not sensitive to as-
sumptions about the location of the scattering screen,
but our derived timescales are uncertain by a factor of
several, both from the unknown velocity of the scatter-
ing material and the unknown distance of the scattering
from the Earth. Also, our estimates of the scattering of

J0716-1900 (from the NE2001 model) are uncertain to a
factor of several, so detailed study of nearby sources or
pulsars along a similar line of sight would be informa-
tive. Finally, refractive scintillation can only cause the
observed ﬂux variability if the majority of the source ﬂux
originates in the compact core emission. The core domi-
nance of J0716-1900 is therefore one of the key questions
for continued studies and can be conﬁrmed using VLBI.
Even with these cautions and remaining uncertainties, it
is evident that refractive scintillation is of fundamental
importance for the interpretation of J0716-1900 and for
radio identiﬁcation of FRB afterglows more generally.
