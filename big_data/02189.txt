A large part of operational quantum mechanics can be reproduced from a classical statistical theory
with a restriction which implies a limit on the amount of knowledge that an agent can have about an
individual system [6, 17]. These epistemic restrictions have recently been restated via the symplectic
structure of the underlying classical theory [18]. Starting with this symplectic framework, we obtain
C∗-algebraic formulation for the epistemically restricted theories. In the case of continuous variables,
the groupoid quantization recipe of E. Hawkins provides us a twisted group C∗-algebra which is the
usual Moyal quantization of a Poisson vector space [11].

Introduction

In 2003, Spekkens introduced as an evidence of an epistemic view of quantum states [17] in order to
conceptually clarify certain quantum phenomena that resist classical explanation. Indeed, the new theory
contains many prominent quantum features including complementarity, no-cloning, no-broadcasting,
teleportation, entanglement, Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism and many others.

The toy theory was next reformulated by Coecke, et al. [7] in the language of symmetric monoidal
categories [13], with the objects of the category representing systems and the morphisms representing
processes undergone by these systems. This formalism, which falls under the programme of Categorical
Quantum Mechanics initiated by Abramsky and Coecke [1], not only provides a consistent mathematical
formulation of the toy theory but it also identiﬁes in a precise way the structural difference -phase group-
between stabilizer quantum mechanics and the toy theory. Namely, the structure of the phase group
carries the main physical difference between these two theories: non-/locality.

Spekkens has recently generalized the toy theory to continuous and ﬁnite variables by positing an
epistemic restriction on what kind of statistical distributions can be prepared in a classical system. This
new theory is called epistricted theory. In this approach, starting with a classical ontological theory one
constructs a statistical theory where an object is a statistical distribution over the physical state space.
Here, the deterministic dynamics change the statistical distribution. Liouville mechanics, statistical the-
ory of bits, statistical optics are some examples of theories obtained at this point of the construction. In
the ﬁnal step, one put forward a restriction on the knowledge of an agent about the statistical distribution
of the system. This results in subtheories of quantum mechanics such as Gaussian epistricted mechanics
(or epistemically-restricted Liouville mechanics), stabilizer subtheory for qutrits, subtheory of quantum
optics. For the case bits, this recipe gives us the original Spekkens’ toy theory which resembles the
stabilizer subtheory of qubits.

The above mentioned epistemical restriction, which is called classical complementarity, states that
the valid epistemic states are those wherein an agent knows the values of a set of variables that commute
relative to the Poisson bracket and is maximally ignorant otherwise.” In order to describe this epistemic

restriction, Spekkens uses a symplectic geometric formalism for which a symplectic inner product is
derived from the Poisson bracket on the pair of functionals over the phase space. Hence, he points out the
possibility of considering symplectic geometry as a possible scheme for an axiomatization programme
of Quantum Mechanics.

A symplectic manifold is also considered to be the phase space of a classical system in an interesting
mathematical abstraction of quantization, namely geometric quantization [2, 4, 20]. In this setting, the
aim is to construct a Hilbert space and observables of the underlying quantum theory from a symplectic
manifold in order to compare and contrast classical and quantum theories. Another quantization scheme
which applies to any Poisson manifold is deformation quantization. According to Riefel’s approach,
a deformation quantization of a Poisson manifold is a continuous ﬁeld of C∗-algebras [15]. This C∗-
algebraic formulation can be related to geometric quantization via symplectic groupoid approach of Eli
Hawkins [11]. Our objective in this paper is to investigate how the epistricted theories ﬁt into mathemat-
ical methods of geometric and deformation quantization.

Finding C∗-algebraic counterpart of the epistricted theories has several beneﬁts. For example, one
can investigate these theories from the operator algebraic point of view. In this direction, the work on
stabilizer formalism for operator quantum error correction [14] and the other related results [12, 3] can
provide insight about the foundational properties of the epistricted theories, such as complementarity,
mutually unbiased bases, contextuality etc.

From the perspective of Categorical Quantum Mechanics, Vicary [19] showed that ﬁnite dimensional
C∗ algebras correspond to the Frobenius algebras over the category of ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
This result gives us a high level categorical formalism to study the characteristics of the epistricted the-
ories. One can for example work on the functoriality between the subcategories of Hilbert spaces corre-
sponding to Quantum subtheories and the subcategories of sets and relations corresponding to epistricted
theories.

The outline of this paper is as follows. We begin section I with a brief summary of the geometric
quantization procedure. We then discuss epistricted theories of continuous variables and their correspon-
dence in geometric quantization framework. We next brieﬂy review Eli Hawkins’ groupoid quantization
recipe from which we obtain the usual Moyal quantization as a twisted group C∗-algebra from the ge-
ometric formulation of epistricted theories. We ﬁnally conclude that the resulting C∗-algebra contains
phase-space formalism for quadrature subtheories. We end the paper with the conclusion and a brief
discussion about the odd degrees of freedom.

2 Epistricted theories for continuous degrees of freedom

In this section, the main objective is to provide a conceptual interpretation of geometric quantization
formalism under the light of epistemically restricted theories. Hence, we ﬁrst give an overview of a
certain segment geometric quantization literature which we are going to utilise to make the connection
with the epistricted theories.

2.1 Geometric quantization

Construction of quantum mechanics from the geometry of classical mechanical objects is the main focus
of the geometric guantization. Here we follow the ﬂow of the lecture notes of Bates and Weinstein [4]
as they start with a speciﬁc case of WKB method and generalize this system to more general phase
spaces. Finally, one can get the connection to algebraic quantization (deformation quantization) via

symplectic groupoid quantization. Thus, our ﬁnal aim is to obtain a C∗-algebra structure which contains
the epistricted theory.

On the other hand, the basic WKB picture stated in a symplectic geometric formalism is sufﬁcient to
cover the epistricted theories. WKB approximate solution of time-independent Schrodinger equation is
f = eiS/¯h where S is a function satisfying Hamilton-Jacobi equation H(x,¶ S/¶ x) = E. This solution can
be realized as the lagrangian sub-manifold of the level set H −1(E) For a ”semi-classical” approximation,
one considers the transport equation

where a is a function on Rn. After multiplying both sides by a, one can ﬁnd that the divergence of
a2(cid:209) S is zero. By considering this condition on the lagrangian manifold L = im(dS), we can deduce

onto Rn where the hamiltonian H is H(q, p) = (cid:229) p2
i /2 +V (q) and |dx| = |dx1 ∧ . . . ∧ dxn| is the canonical
density on Rn. Since XH is tangent to L by the Jacobi-Hamilton theorem and since lie derivative is
(a2|dx|) = 0 implies that the pullback p ∗(a2|dx|) is
invariant under diffeomorphism, the equation L
invariant under ﬂow XH, where p

As a result, a geometric semi-classical state is deﬁned as a lagrangian manifold L of R2n equipped
with a function a (half-density). This state is stationary when L lies in the level set of the hamiltonian
and a is invariant under its ﬂow and the transformations correspond to Hamiltonians. Table 1 shows the
correspondence between semi-classical (geometric) and quantum (algebraic) objects in this speciﬁc case.
To be consistent with the formalism of epistricted theories, we deﬁne the lagrangian condition for a
symplectic vector space as follows: For a symplectic vector space (V,w ), w -orthogonal to a subspace
W ⊂ V is deﬁned as the set W ⊥ = {x ∈ V : w (x,y) = 0, ∀y ∈ W }. A subspace is called isotropic if it
is contained in its orthogonal. Any self orthogonal subspace, i.e. W = W ⊥, is called lagrangian. As a
result of non-degeneracy of w

, one can obtain dimW = 1

2 dimV .

2.2 Quadrature Epistricted Theories

We now introduce the quadrature epistricted theories for continuous variables [18]. The epistemic re-
strictions on classical variables are adopted from the condition of the joint measurability of quantum

4

observables. A set of variables are jointly knowable if and only if it is commuting with respect to the
Poisson bracket. The other restriction besides joint knowability is that an agent can know only the vari-
ables which are linear combination of the position and momentum variables.

If we start with the phase space W = R2n where a point is denoted by m = (p1,q1, . . . ,pn,qn), epis-

temic restrictions imply that the functionals f : W → R are of the form

f = a1q1 + b1p1 + . . . + anqn + bn pn + c

where a1,b1, . . . ,an,bn,c ∈ R and pi(m) = pi and qi(m) = qi are functionals associated with mo-
is associated with a vector f =
mentum and and position , respectively. Hence, each functional
(a1,b1, . . . ,an,bn). It is not hard to show that the value of the Poisson bracket over the phase space
is uniform and equal to the symplectic inner product:
¶ g
¶ pi

[ f ,g]PB(m) =

)(m) = hf,gi

¶ f
¶ qi

¶ f

−

where

hf,gi = fT Jg

and J is the skew symmetric 2n × 2n matrix with components Ji j = d i, j+1 − d i+1, j. Hence, the vector
becomes a symplectic vector space with the symplectic inner product w = h·, ·i. This allows us
space W
to give the geometric presentation of the quadrature variables.

The only set of variables jointly knowable are the ones that are Poisson commuting. In symplectic
geometry, this set corresponds to the subspace V of vectors whose symplectic inner product vanish, i.e.
∀ f ,g ∈ V h f ,gi = 0. For a 2n-dimensional phase space, the maximum possible dimension of such a V
is n. Such a maximal space is a Lagrangian space as deﬁned above and it corresponds to the maximal
possible knowledge an agent can have. In order to specify an epistemic state one should also set the
values of the variables on V . The linear functional v acting on a quadrature functional corresponds to the
set of vectors in v ∈ V which is determined via v( f ) = fT v.

In summary, a pure state in the epistricted theory consists of a Lagrangian subspace V ∈ R2n and a
valuation functional v : R2n → R. In geometric quantization, the half density function can be regarded as
this valuation function.

On the other hand, the valid transformations are the symplectic transformations which maps the
quadrature variables to itself. These transformations map a phase space vector m ∈ W
to Sm + a where a
is a displacement vector and S is 2n × 2n symplectic matrix. The group formed by these transformation
is called the afﬁne symplectic group, which is subgroup of the hamiltonian symplectomorphism group.
Thus, each of these transformation can be obtained from a hamiltonian. Finally, the sharp measurements
are parametrized by Poisson commuting sets of quadrature variables (isotropic subspaces V ) and the
outcomes are indexed by the vectors in V .

We summarize the correspondence between geometric quantization and epistricted theories in Table

2.

2.3 Groupoid Quantization

The aim of this section is to point out that the epistricted theories can be quantized by a twisted polarized
convolution C∗-algebra of a symplectic groupoid in the sense of E. Hawkins. The main idea in this
method is to ﬁnd a C∗-algebra which is approximated by a Poisson algebra of functions on a manifold.
C∗-algebra quantization is mainly developed by the work of Rieffel where the quantization is stated as

additional structures on the symplectic groupoid. In his approach, it is possible to reinterpret geometric
quantization for a broader class of examples, coming from deformation quantization of Poisson algebras.
This gives a rigorous treatment to the dictionary strategy of Weinstein relating the symplectic category
and its geometrically quantized counterpart. [4].

Here is the Hawkins’ strategy for geometric quantization of a manifold W

.For a detailed discussion,

one can refer to [11].

• The target map t : S 2 → S 0 assigns to each arrow g ∈ S 2 its target t(g). For two objects x, y ∈ S 0,

one writes g : x → y to indicate that g ∈ S 2 is an arrow with s(g) = x and t(g).

• If g and h are arrows with s(h) = t(g), one can form their composition, denoted hg, with s(hg) =
s(g) and t(hg) = t(h). If g : x → y and h : y → z then hg is deﬁned and hg : x → z. The composition
map m is deﬁned by m(h,g) = hg.

• The involution map −∗ : S 2 → S 2. Here, if g : x → y then g∗ : y → x is two sided inverse for

Deﬁnition 1. A Lie groupoid is a topological groupoid S where S 0 and S 2 are smooth manifolds, and
such that the structure maps s, t, m, u and −∗ are smooth. Moreover, s and t are required to be submer-
sions so that the domain of m is a smooth manifold.

As m is lagrangian, one can ﬁnd a unique Poisson structure on S 0 of a symplectic groupoid such that

s is a Poisson map and t is anti-Poisson. Hence, we have the following deﬁnition.

We identify R2n ⊕ ¯R2n with the cotangent bundle T ∗(R2n) as follows: For the local coordinates of cov-
ectors (u,x ), (v,h ) in T ∗(R2n), the cotangent symplectic structure is
s ∗((u,x ), (v,h )) = x (u) − h (v).

This gives us a symplectomorphism F

: R2n ⊕ ¯R2n → T ∗(R2n) such that
: (x,y) 7→ (1/2(x + y), ˆw (x − y))

where F

One can obtain the the Darboux coordinates (q1, . . . ,qn, p1, . . . , pn) of T ∗(R2n) from the symplecto-

Thus this is a polarization of the symplectic groupoid given by

The symplectic potential which vanishes on P can be chosen as q P = −pidqi.

P = span{¶ /¶ p1, . . . ,¶ /¶ pn}

This polization gives us the half-form pairing, which enables quantizable observables to be repre-
sented as operators on the Hilbert space L2(R2n).Hence, this yields the correspondence between the
kernels of operators on L2(R2n) and Weyl symbols of these operators. This kernel T of an operator f is
given by

T f (p,q) = CZ f (

The quantization procedure gives the twisted group algebra C∗(W

{q,p} . This is the usual Moyal quantization of a Poisson vector space (see [16]). In this setting,
the observables corresponds to functions in classical phase-space and the Moyal product of functions is
derived from the product of pair of observables. Hence, the Moyal quantization is attempt to formulate
quantum mechanics using phase-space formalism of classical mechanics. The position and momentum
operators correspond to the generators of the Heisenberg group and they are related to each other by a
Fourier transform.

We now show that quadrature quantum subtheories agree with the Moyal quantization, in the sym-
plectic case. To be consistent with the formalism of [18], we work with projector valued measures

(PVM) rather than Hermitian operators. PVMs are used in quantum information and quantum founda-
tions to represent measurements as eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are operationally insigniﬁcant
and serve as labels of outcomes. A projector-valued measure with outcome set K is a set of projectors

We now deﬁne a unitary representation of symplectic afﬁne transformation to introduce the other
quadrature observables. The projective unitary representation ˆV of the symplectic group acting on the
phase space W
is
a phase factor. The action of this unitary is deﬁned by the conjugation

and where eif

V (S)(·) = ˆV (S)(·) ˆV †(S).

For single degree of freedom, let S f be the symplectic matrix that takes the position functional q to a
quadrature functional f such that S f q = f. Then the quadrature observable associated with f is deﬁned
as follows

O f = { ˆP

f (f) : f ∈ R}

where

ˆP

f (f) = V (S f )( ˆP

q(f)).

For the n degrees of freedom W = R2n, the quadrature observable associated with f is given by

where

O f = { ˆP

f (f) : f ∈ R2n}

ˆP

f (f) = V (S f )(I ⊗ · · · ⊗ ˆP

qi(f) ⊗ · · · ⊗ I)

for S f qi = f. We also know that the set of quadrature observables {O fi} commute if and only if the cor-
responding functionals { fi} are Poisson-commuting (see [17]). Hence, the commuting set of quadrature
observables can be labelled by isotropic subspaces of W
. This set deﬁnes a single quadrature observable

where

OV = { ˆP V (v) : v ∈ V }

ˆP V (v) = (cid:213)

ˆP

f (i)( f (i)v).

On the other hand, in the geometric quantization procedure, any functional f on W

is mapped to a
hermitian operator ˆf in a prequantum Hilbert space which corresponds to the observable O f = { ˆP
f (f) :
f ∈ R2n}. Moreover, the commutation relation for the observables in both quadrature subtheories and
geometric quantization, is implied by the Poisson commutation relation of the classical observables.

2In the continuous case one can also use Hermitian operators corresponding to the real valued functionals but the commu-
tation relation of Hermitian operators does not have ﬁnite counterpart Therefore, Spekkens preferred to use PVMs in order to
cover ﬁnite and continuous cases simultaneously.

8

GeometricQuantizationandEpistemicallyRestrictedTheories

As the polarization is the commuting set of these hermitian operators, the state that is obtained after
quantization is the operator ˆP V (v).The choice of the vertical polarization for the groupoid W ⊕ W
∗ is the
responsible of the correspondence between the two quantum states. The half-form pairing deﬁned above
can be computed in terms of the integral kernel of the projection operator ˆP
f , which has Weyl symbol f .
This establishes a correspondence between phase-space formalism and quantum mechanics and Moyal
product is deduced from this correspondence.

In [17], the operational equivalence quantum subtheories and epistricted theories is proven using
Wigner representation which maps operators in Hilbert space to the functions in phase-space formula-
tion of quantum mechanics. It is also well-known fact that the Wigner representation of an operator
product is given by the Moyal product. As a result, geometric quantization with an appropriate choice of
polarization is operationally equivalent to epistricted theories. We can also conlude that group algebra
∗,s ), which is the Hilbert space considered as a group representation of the Heisenberg
C∗(H) = C∗(W
group H, contains the algebraic structure of quadrature subtheories.

3 Conclusion and further work

We establish the relationship between geometric quantization and quadrature subtheories for the conti-
nous degrees of freedom. We conclude that the group algebra C∗(H) for Heisenberg group H contains
the quadrature subtheories as a result of groupoid quantization procedure. One can use this fact to give
operator algebraic approach to quantum optics.

This construction also suggests that there is a ”geometric quantization” functor, from a subcategory
of the category of groupoids to the category of C∗-algebras. Following [8], this should correspond to
a functor from Frobenius algebras in the category FRel (Frobenius algebras in the category of sets and
relations) to Frobenius algebras in the category of Hilbert spaces FHilb. The functor has to be deﬁned in
the subcategory of Frobenius algebras arising from symplectic groupoids, and the morphisms have to be
adapted in order to obtain functoriality. An explicit and detailed description of the functor in this context
will be given in a future publication.

In ongoing work, we investigate discrete degrees of freedom. The variables in this case are chosen
from a ﬁnite ﬁeld instead of real numbers. Even though Spekkens’ original toy theory [18] is contained
in the case where ﬁnite ﬁeld is Z/2, we will ﬁrst consider odd degrees freedom. The reason is that for
W = (Z/2)n the discrete Wigner representation can take negative values and therefore the epistricted
theory does not coincide with the quadrature subtheories [17]. ”Quantization” schemes in ﬁnite degrees
were not studied extensively but there are some result worth to check from the conceptual viewpoint of
epistricted theories [9]. Our aim is to give a discrete version of groupoid quantization that also contains
the functorial case of [9]. We conjecture that the resulting algebra is C∗(H) for the ﬁnite Heisenberg
group H. This ﬁnite C∗-algebra corresponds to a Frobenius structure via the construction of Vicary
[19]. Thus, one can study quantum phenomena such as complementarity in quadrature theories in this
algebraic framework.
