We discuss the correlation function for the metric for homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies. The
exact propagator equation determines the correlation function as the inverse of the second functional
derivative of the quantum eﬀective action, for which we take the Einstein-Hilbert approximation.
This formulation relates the metric correlation function employed in quantum gravity computations
to cosmological observables as the graviton power spectrum. While the graviton correlation function
can be obtained equivalently as a solution of the linearized Einstein equations, this does not hold for
the vector and scalar components of the metric. We project the metric ﬂuctuations on the subspace
of “physical ﬂuctuations”, which couple to a conserved energy momentum tensor. On the subspace
of physical metric ﬂuctuations the relation to physical sources becomes invertible, such that the
eﬀective action and its relation to correlation functions does not need gauge ﬁxing. The physical
metric ﬂuctuations have a similar status as the Bardeen potentials, while being formulated in a
covariant way. We compute the eﬀective action for the physical metric ﬂuctuations for geometries
corresponding to realistic cosmologies.

Introduction

The (two-point) correlation function or propagator for
the metric plays a central role for computations in quan-
tum gravity. A typical loop contribution from the met-
ric ﬂuctuations involves a trace over powers of the met-
ric propagator, with appropriate vertices inserted. Within
functional renormalization the exact ﬂow equation for the
eﬀective average action Γk,

variant ﬂuctuation quantities (Bardeen potentials [9]). If
the background obeys the ﬁeld equations only the graviton
mode is propagating, whereas the gauge invariant scalar
and vector modes contained in the metric play the role
of “auxiliary ﬁelds” that do no propagate. The conse-
quences of the non-propagating character of scalar and vec-
tor modes for quantum gravity calculations are not much
explored. The auxiliary ﬁeld property does not hold away
from solutions of the ﬁeld equations. It is not easily visible
on the level of the metric ﬂuctuations in covariant gauges,
for which the diﬀerence between background geometries
obeying the ﬁeld equations or not is not very apparent at
ﬁrst sight. We clarify in this paper the relation between
the non-propagating Bardeen potentials and the non-trivial
metric correlation function in the vector and scalar sector.
For background geometries obeying the ﬁeld equations
the metric correlation contains directly the information
about the power spectrum of cosmic ﬂuctuations. For ex-
ample, the amplitude and spectrum of the tensor ﬂuctua-
tions can be extracted directly from the equal time corre-
lation function for the graviton component of the metric.
The situation is similar for an additional scalar (inﬂaton)
ﬁeld for which amplitude and spectrum can be obtained
from the (gauge invariant) scalar correlation. Since sub-
stantial work has been invested in the computation of the
cosmic ﬂuctuation spectrum for various interesting cos-
mological solutions [10–16], one may use this knowledge
in order to gain information about the metric correlation
for realistic cosmological solutions. In the other direction,
a computation of the quantum correlation for the metric
translates directly to important cosmological observables.
While the connection between existing computations of
the cosmic ﬂuctuation spectrum and the metric correla-
tion is rather direct for the propagating graviton ﬂuctua-
tions (or an additional inﬂaton), this is no longer the case
for the scalar and vector modes contained in the metric.
First of all, the standard approach of using commutation
relations for operators of free ﬁelds for the deﬁnition of
a “vacuum correlation” is only meaningful for the propa-

involves the propagator Gk in presence of the infrared cut-
oﬀ Rk [1–3]. While the metric correlation in ﬂat space can
be computed rather easily for a simple form of the eﬀec-
tive action, much less is known for the metric correlation
in curved space.

Functional methods in quantum ﬁeld theory work best
if the “background ﬁeld”, for which expressions as (1) are
evaluated, is close to an extremum of the action. For exam-
ple, the functional renormalization group for scalar ﬁelds
gives excellent results in simple truncations if one expands
around the minimum of the eﬀective potential [4–8].
In
contrast, expansions with few couplings around the origin
in ﬁeld space, ϕ = 0, fail to provide good results in case
of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For quantum gravity
computations often only a few couplings are kept. One
therefore would like to evaluate the eﬀective action in the
vicinity of characteristic solutions of the cosmological ﬁeld
equations. Typically, these may be geometries close to de
Sitter space as relevant for inﬂation. This is also the region
in ﬁeld space for which knowledge of the eﬀective action Γ
is most useful. The exact ﬁeld equations follow from the
ﬁrst functional variation of Γ and employ therefore knowl-
edge about its form in the vicinity of the relevant solution.
In gravity, the metric propagator evaluated for a back-
ground that solves the ﬁeld equations (“on shell propa-
gator”) shows particular properties that do not hold for
general background geometries. One may deﬁne gauge in-

2

gating ﬁelds. Second, the linearized ﬁeld equations (mode
equations) admit for the gauge invariant scalar ﬁelds or
gravitational potentials Φ, Ψ (Bardeen potentials) only the
solution Φ = Ψ = 0 in the absence of additional matter
ﬂuctuations. The usual prescription for obtaining the cor-
relation function as a product of mode functions (solutions
of the mode equation) would then imply that the metric
correlation in the scalar sector vanishes. This is, however,
not the case.

For the gauge invariant vector ﬂuctuation Ωm the situ-
ation is similar. The only solution of the mode equation
is Ωm = 0, while we ﬁnd a rotation invariant correlation
function in Fourier space

We will concentrate in this paper on the projection to
physical metric ﬂuctuations. We show that this is equiva-
lent to a particular gauge ﬁxing. For local gauge theories
as gravity the source for the metric ﬁeld is related to the
energy momentum tensor T µν. A central point of our for-
malism is the restriction to sources that reﬂect covariantly
conserved energy momentum tensors, T µν
;ν = DνT µν = 0,
with Dν a covariant derivative. Such sources couple only
to covariantly conserved metric ﬂuctuations, such that the
quantum eﬀective action will only involve these “physical
ﬂuctuations” of the metric. A quantum ﬁeld theory for
gravity can be formulated as a functional integral over the
“ﬂuctuating metric” g′
µν as

Here η is conformal time, a(η) the scalar factor, M the
Planck mass and ~k the comoving wave number. This cor-
relation function is “instantaneous”, i.e. ∼ δ(η − η′), and
reﬂects the role of Ωm as an auxiliary ﬁeld. It cannot be
written as a product of mode functions.

For the computation of the metric correlation or Green’s
function we need a method that goes beyond mode func-
tions for free quantum ﬁelds. We will directly employ the
deﬁning equation for the Green’s function G

Here semicolons denote covariant derivatives that are
formed with the “background metric” ¯gµν such that ¯gµν;ρ =
0. Similarly, an arbitrary symmetric second rank con-
travariant tensor Bµν is decomposed as

with Γ(2) involving a suitable diﬀerential operator and E
the unit matrix in the appropriate space of ﬁelds. Here
G is considered as a matrix with internal and space or
momentum indices, and similar for Γ(2). For the quantum
eﬀective action Γ the matrix Γ(2) is the second functional
derivative, and eq.
(3) is an exact identity that follows
from the basic deﬁnition of the eﬀective action. The use
of this identity for the computation of primordial cosmic
ﬂuctuations has been demonstrated in refs.
[17–19]. One
recovers known results as special solutions, but also can
discuss the most general solution as an initial value problem
for a diﬀerential equation.

For an eﬀective action of gravity which is invariant under
general coordinate transformations (diﬀeomorphisms) the
second functional derivative is not invertible in the func-
tion space of arbitrary metric ﬂuctuations. The local gauge
symmetry implies that there are “gauge modes” for which
Γ(2) vanishes. There are two possible ways to cope with this
issue. The ﬁrst reduces the ﬁeld space for G and Γ(2) to
“physical ﬂuctuations” by projecting out the “gauge ﬂuc-
tuations”.
In this case E is a projector on the space of
physical ﬂuctuations. The second functional derivative be-
comes invertible on this restricted space if suitable bound-
ary conditions are speciﬁed. (For massless ﬁelds the zero
momentum mode may need a special regularization). The
second alternative employs gauge ﬁxing in a standard way.
In the presence of gauge ﬁxing Γ is no longer gauge in-
variant. Thus Γ(2) becomes invertible on the full space of
metric ﬂuctuations and E is the unit matrix in this space.

one ﬁnds indeed that only the physical metric ˆg′
µν couples
to T µν. Restricting the source to TV = 0, the argument of
the eﬀective action Γ will be restricted to

ˆgµν = ¯gµν + fµν , fµν = hf ′

µνi , fµν;

ν = 0.

(8)

In order to avoid explicit constraints for the metric we
may extend the argument of Γ formally to arbitrary metrics
gµν. The fact that it actually only depends on ¯gµν + fµν is
then reﬂected by the local gauge symmetry of Γ. The local
gauge symmetry corresponds to the statement that Γ does
not depend on

It will be natural to choose for the ﬂuctuating metric in
the functional integral a gauge a′
µν; = 0, corre-
sponding to g′
µν. For the functional integral deﬁning
quantum gravity one may therefore employ a correspond-
ing gauge ﬁxing with the associated ghosts. On the level of
the relation between the eﬀective action and the correlation
function for the metric the gauge ﬁxing and ghost terms
are not needed if G is restricted to the correlation function
for physical metric ﬂuctuations and E is the appropriate
projector. We can work directly with a diﬀeomorphism
invariant quantum eﬀective action Γ.

The physical metric ﬂuctuations fµν are “gauge invari-
ant” in the same sense as the Bardeen potentials. We ex-
plicitly construct the relation between the physical metric
ﬂuctuations and the Bardeen potentials, which turn out to
be rather involved. In contrast to the Bardeen potentials
the projection on fµν can be done in a manifestly covari-
ant way. This is important for quantum gravity and ﬂow
equations where diﬀeomorphism invariance plays a crucial
role in order to restrict the form of the eﬀective action.
There is, however, a price to pay for the covariant formula-
tion. While the relation of the Bardeen potentials to metric
ﬂuctuations is simple in certain gauges as the Newtonian
gauge, it gets more complex in a covariant setting.

The correlation function G for the metric is an impor-
tant quantity beyond its crucial role for quantum gravity
computations on one side and the cosmic ﬂuctuation spec-
trum on the other side. For example, it enters directly the
computation of the bispectrum B from the third functional
derivative of the eﬀective action Γ(3), that we may symbol-
ically express as B = Γ(3)G3. In this paper we discuss G in
the Einstein frame. The determination of G by the propa-
gator equation (3) makes transformations between diﬀerent
frames straightforward [19].

Besides the development of the formalism for comput-
ing G from the propagator equation, and the direct rela-
tion between cosmological ﬂuctuation observables and the
covariant metric correlation appearing in quantum grav-
ity calculations, our paper also contains practical progress:
we derive the explicit form of the propagator equation for
the physical metric ﬂuctuations for a homogeneous and
isotropic cosmological background. The propagator equa-
tion (3) is a diﬀerential equation,

DG = E,

(10)

with diﬀerential operator D = Γ(2). This makes it man-
ifest that G is given by an initial value problem [20–29],
and is not a priori ﬁxed for a given cosmological solution
and a given time. As a simple condition for a possible
scaling solution [17] we employ here the condition that the
high momentum tail of the metric correlation is already at
some early time given by the Lorentz invariant correlation
function in ﬂat space. This generalizes the Bunch-Davies
initial condition [30] to interacting ﬁelds, arbitrary geo-
metric backgrounds and non-propagating modes. It selects
a particular correlation among several proposed ones [31–
34]. The complete discussion of the physical metric cor-
relation function in ﬂat space presented in this paper is
therefore not only a very explicit example how the pro-
jection on physical ﬂuctuations operates, but also sets the
initial conditions for the solution of eq.(10).

This paper is organized as follows: we discuss the phys-
ical and gauge ﬂuctuations of the metric in sect.II and the
corresponding quantum eﬀective action in sect.III. Sect.IV
turns to the correlation function for the metric and the
deﬁning propagator equation (10). The metric correlation
in ﬂat space is addressed in sect.V. This demonstrates sev-
eral issues as projectors on physical modes, irreducible rep-
resentations of the rotation group, connection to Bardeen

3

potentials, time dependence and gauge ﬁxing in an explicit
form, using a language that can be directly used in the
following sections. In sect.VI we turn to homogeneous and
isotropic geometries and discuss, in particular, the role of
mode functions, the linearized Einstein equations, projec-
tors on physical ﬂuctuations, and the connection to gauge
ﬁxing. Sect.VII proceeds to a decomposition of the physi-
cal metric ﬂuctuations into representations of the rotation
group. We obtain propagator equations for the individual
modes which will be the basis for a future explicit computa-
tion of the correlation function for all metric components.
In sect.VIII we specialize to the graviton correlation which
is technically simplest. This makes a direct connection to
the observable tensor modes in the primordial cosmic ﬂuc-
tuation spectrum. Our conclusions are found in sect.IX.
Several more technical points, as the explicit connection to
the Bardeen potentials or a more general mode decompo-
sition can be found in appendices.

such that the source term is diﬀeomorphism invariant. For
the functional measure we will employ a background ﬁeld
formalism such that the measure is invariant under a simul-
taneous diﬀeomorphism transformation of the background
metric and the ﬂuctuations, see below. Therefore Z is in-
variant under this combined transformation.

which can be obtained by covariant derivatives of a vector

This identiﬁes inﬁnitesimal a′
µν with the inﬁnitesimal
change of the background metric ¯gµν under a diﬀeomor-
phism transformation. By a suitable gauge transformation
one can always achieve a′
µ = 0. This justiﬁes the naming
of a′

µν as the gauge part of the metric g′

lation where eqs. (18), (19) employ the macroscopic metric
gµν which is the argument of the eﬀective action, such that

for all gµν the energy momentum tensor is covariantly con-
served. This possibility will be described elsewhere. In this
case ¯gµν is identiﬁed with gµν ,

gµν =

∂lnZ
∂K µν ,

(32)

and the source term is no longer linear. Alternatively,
we may keep ¯gµν diﬀerent from gµν, and the present set-
ting can be viewed as an approximation to the formulation
which uses the macroscopic metric.

III. Quantum eﬀective action

For the construction of the eﬀective action we have two
options. The ﬁrst one restricts the sources to those obeying
the constraint (19).
In consequence, the eﬀective action
will only depend on ﬁelds that couple to the constrained
source, i.e.

(33)

ˆgµν =(cid:10)ˆg′
µν(cid:11) .
fµν =(cid:10)f ′
µν(cid:11) ,

These ﬁelds will be constrained according to

ˆgµν = ¯gµν + fµν ,

f

ν

µν; = 0.

(34)

In this formulation the eﬀective action contains no gauge
modes such that the second functional derivative Γ(2) is
typically invertible once projected on the appropriate space
of physical ﬂuctuations.
If a possible gauge ﬁxing term
vanishes for gµν = ˆgµν, it needs not to be included on
the level of the eﬀective action. This is the option we will
mainly pursue in this paper. The second option considers
instead of the constrained sources K µν arbitrary sources
Lµν, and therefore arbitrary gµν. Then typically a gauge
ﬁxing term is present in Γ. One can subsequently project
on the space of physical metric ﬂuctuations. If the gauge
ﬁxing term is projected out by this procedure it no longer
appears in the projected quantities. In our case we will see
that the two options are equivalent.

1. Eﬀective action for constrained ﬁelds

µν into ˆg′

µν and a′

Let us now formulate the eﬀective action in the presence
of constraints on sources and ﬁelds. Our starting point is
the partition function (31) where we have indicated explic-
itly that Z depends on the background metric ¯gµν. One
point concerns the constraint (19) for K µν which involves
the connection formed with ¯gµν . Also the deﬁnition of the
split of g′
µν involves ¯gµν. It is worthwhile
to note, however, that for our construction the background
metric only enters indirectly through the projections on
physical sources and ﬁelds, i.e. K µν and ˆg′
g′
ρτ .
By construction, Z[K µν; ¯gµν] is diﬀeomorphism invariant
if both K µν and ¯gµν are transformed simultaneously. The
invariant partition function is the basis for the construction
of the quantum eﬀective action.

µν = P (f )ρτ

µν

For this purpose, we deﬁne as usual the generating func-

tional for the connected correlation functions

W [K µν ; ¯gµν] = ln Z[K µν; ¯gµν],

δW
δK µν = hˆg′

µνi = ˆgµν.

(35)

Here ˆgµν obeys the same constraint as ˆg′

µν , namely

ˆgµν:

ν = 0.

5

(36)

(Recall that this constraint is not trivial since covariant
derivatives are formed with ¯gµν ). Due to the presence of
the constraint (36) we can invert eq.(35) and obtain the
constrained source K µν as a functional of ˆgµν.

Employing the general decomposition

gµν = ¯gµν + bµν +

µ = 0 , vµ

;µ = 0,

(38)

the constraint (36) is realized for

vµ = 0,

τ = 0.

(39)

Indeed, we have chosen the basis (37) such that for vµ =
ν = 0, according to eq. (36). Due to
0, τ = 0 one has gµν;
the restriction (19) for the sources, which corresponds to
a conserved energy momentum tensor, no “gauge part”of
gµν is present. The metric ˆgµν contains therefore only the
“physical excitations” around the background, namely bµν
and σ, while vµ and τ are set to zero,

fµν = bµν +

The eﬀective action obtains by a Legendre transform

Γ[ˆgµν; ¯gµν] = −W [K µν; ¯gµν ] +Zx

(41)

with K µν[ˆgµν; ¯gµν ] obtained by solving eq.(35). As usual,
one has

This setting is realized by considering Γ as a functional
of fµν (as well as ¯gµν), while W depends on sources that
correspond to T µν in the general decomposition (6).

formation of ¯gµν , the source transformation (13), and a
transformation of fµν as a tensor,

δξfµν = −∂µξρfρν − ∂νξρfµρ − ξρ∂ρfµν.

(44)

Since the relation (42) between sources and ﬁelds is covari-
ant (δΓ/δˆgµν = δΓ/δfµν) we conclude that the eﬀective ac-
tion (41) is invariant under simultaneous transformations
of ¯gµν and fµν.

Furthermore, we may multiply the source constraint (19)

and

Formally, this can be interpreted as invariance under a local
gauge transformation of fµν , with inﬁnitesimal transforma-
tion ˜δfµν = ˜δµν.

The transformation ˜δfµν = ˜δµν is, however, not com-
patible with the constraint (34), since Dν ˜δµν 6= 0. We
can extend the eﬀective action to be a functional of uncon-
strained metric ﬂuctuations hµν by replacing fµν by hµν,
Γ [fµν, ¯gµν] → Γ [hµν , ¯gµν]. The extended eﬀective action
depends now on two unconstrained metrics ¯gµν and

gµν = ¯gµν + hµν ,

i.e.

Γ [gµν, ¯gµν] = Γ [fµν → hµν , ¯gµν] .

(48)

(49)

By virtue of eq. (47) it is invariant under the inﬁnitesimal
gauge transformation

˜δhµν = − (ξµ;ν + ξν;µ) = δξ ¯gµν.

(50)

The transformation (50) is taken at ﬁxed ¯gµν . It expresses
the fact that Γ depends actually only on fµν and not on
the gauge ﬂuctuations aµν. The two local transformations,

Instead of the variables hµν and ¯gµν it is convenient to

with M2 typically involving derivative operators. Nonvan-
ishing M1, M2 reﬂect the residual dependence of Γ on the
background metric ¯gµν for ﬁxed gµν. The symmetry (56)
of simultaneous diﬀeomorphism transformations of gµν and
hµν is obeyed if ¯Γ [g] is a gauge invariant functional of gµν
and M1, M2 transform as appropriate tensor densities. The
local gauge symmetry (57) constrains the possible form of
M1 and M2, but is not suﬃcient to enforce that these quan-
tities vanish.

3. Expansion in physical metric ﬂuctuations

For a given background metric ¯gµν we can expand the
eﬀective action in terms of the physical metric ﬂuctua-
tions fµν . We choose the background metric such that for
some particular “physical” source K µν
the ﬁeld equation
0
is obeyed if ˆgµν = ¯gµν ,

δΓ

(ˆgµν = ¯gµν) = K µν

Both K µν

(62) yields a constraint on Γ(2),

and ∆K µν obey separately eq. (19). Thus eq.

Eq.(66) is therefore an exact “propagator equation” for the
Green’s function

(65)

The formulation of the eﬀective action in terms of “phys-
ical metrics” obeying a constraint, due to the use of con-
strained physical sources, may seem somewhat unfamiliar.
In appendix A we relate this formulation to the more com-
mon approach with gauge ﬁxing.
It corresponds to the
limit of an inﬁnite gauge parameter β that enforces the
constraint fµν;

ν = 0.

IV. Correlation function

In this section we discuss the deﬁning equation for the
correlation function, namely the exact propagator equa-
tion (3) based on the second functional derivative of the
eﬀective action. For the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cos-
mological constant we display the inverse propagator both
for unconstrained metric ﬂuctuations hµν and for physical
metric ﬂuctuations fµν.

1. Propagator equation

We may interpret the second functional derivatives Γ(2)
and W (2) as matrices. They obey the usual matrix identity

Γ(2)W (2) = 1,

(66)

that follows directly from the deﬁning relations for Γ. In
position space this reads

Γ(2)µνρτ (x, y)W (2)

ρτ σλ(y, z) = Eµν

σλ(x, z),

(67)

where Eµν
σλ is the unit matrix in the space of appropriate
functions. For unconstrained hσλ the unit matrix reads

of a constraint for fµν it becomes the projector P (f )µν
σλ,
which obeys the deﬁning relations (28).

ρτ σλ(x, y).

(69)

If Γ(2) contains time-derivatives this is an evolution equa-
tion which describes the time dependence of the Green’s
function. Typically, Γ(2) is of the form

Γ(2)µνρτ (x, y) = δ(x − y)Γ(2)µνρτ (y),

(70)
where Γ(2)µνρτ (y) contains derivatives with respect to y.
The resulting propagator equation reads
Γ(2)µνρτ (x)Gρτ σλ(x, y) = Eµν

σλ(x, y).

(71)

2. Inverse propagator for unconstrained metric
ﬂuctuations

In principle, the eﬀective action Γ[gµν ; ¯gµν] depends on
gµν directly, and further on ¯gµν which enters the con-
straints for the physical sources K µν and the physical met-
ric gµν. Due to the source constraint Γ actually only de-
pends on physical metric ﬂuctuations and ¯gµν. Replacing
gµν by ˆgµν = ¯gµν + fµν we can write Γ[bµν, σ, ¯gµν ], where
the decomposition (37) is performed for ﬁxed ¯gµν. We re-
call that no “gauge part” of gµν appears due to the re-
striction to physical sources, i.e. vµ = 0, τ = 0. This will
allow for an invertibility of Γ(2) on an appropriate space of
functions and for appropriate boundary conditions.

µ;ν = 0.

µν → f ′

µν − uµν, with uν

Consider next the transversal split transformation ¯gµν →
¯gµν + uµν, f ′
(This
is complementary to the longitudinal split transformation
sµν = ξµ;ν + ξν;µ discussed in the previous section.) The
transversal split symmetry is violated only by the con-
straints on K µν and ˆg′
µν . If we neglect eﬀects of this explicit
breaking the eﬀective action becomes invariant under the
split transformation ¯gµν → ¯gµν + uµν, fµν → fµν − uµν.
It is then a gauge invariant functional of the unique met-
ric ˆgµν = ¯gµν + fµν . The transversal split symmetry im-
plies M1,2 = 0 in the expansion (58). Extending again
the argument of Γ to arbitrary metric ﬂuctuations hµν,
gµν = ¯gµν + hµν , the eﬀective action becomes a diﬀeomor-
phism invariant functional of gµν, corresponding to ¯Γ [g] in
eq. (58). We will adopt this approximation in the following,
neglecting corrections due to the explicit ¯gµν-dependence
of the constraints.

We will next assume a simple form of Γ based on an ex-
pansion in the number of derivatives. The ﬁrst two lowest
invariants are given by

(76)

Applying a suitable projection of this operator in eq. (71)
constitutes the basic equation of this paper. Correlation
functions are obtained as solutions to this diﬀerential equa-
tion with appropriate initial values.

We can take account of the constraint to physical met-
rics in diﬀerent equivalent ways. One method projects the
second functional derivative (76) onto the space of physi-
cal metrics. A second one inserts the constraint f ν
µ;ν = 0
already into the expansion of Γ. If the physical metric ﬂuc-
tuations fµν are expressed in terms of independent ﬁelds
one can directly obtain Γ(2) in the space of these ﬁelds
by functional variation. While the second method is often
technically simpler, we will also use occasionally the ﬁrst
method in order to make the role of projections apparent.

3. Physical metric ﬂuctuations

According to the second method we directly investigate
the eﬀective action (72) in quadratic order in the physical
metric ﬂuctuations fµν, f ν

Due to the last relation the trace σ and the traceless part

A decomposition of fµν into independent ﬁelds can be

done as

fµν = tµν + sµν

where tµν is traceless and divergence free

tµν ¯gµν = 0 , tν

while sµν is a linear function of σ

sµν = ˆSµνσ,

with

The construction of the operator ˆSµν needs, however, some
care due to the non-commuting properties of the covariant
derivatives.
It is not unique, since we can always add a
divergence free and traceless tensor to sµν .

For important simple cases we can easily ﬁnd ˆSµν . Con-
sider geometries with a constant curvature scalar, ∂µ ¯R = 0.
In this case we can choose

ˆSµν = (¯gµν D2 − DµDν + ¯Rµν )(3D2 + ¯R)−1.

Indeed, one has

V. Metric correlation in ﬂat space

Γ(2)µνρτ aρτ = 0.

(116)

In this section we discuss the metric correlation function
in a ﬂat space background. This has the advantage that
all projections can be made in a simple explicit form, and
D2 becomes a block-diagonal diﬀerential operator. The
ﬂat space correlation function describes the limiting high
momentum or short distance behavior of the metric corre-
lation in an arbitrary background geometry. This holds in
the range where terms involving the curvature tensor can
be neglected as compared to the squared momentum.

For a non-compact space as Minkowski space a unique
speciﬁcation of the Green’s function involves boundary con-
ditions. They are typically set at some initial time, that
may go to minus inﬁnity. We do not discuss here the gen-
eral solution of the evolution equation for the propagator
[17]. We rather impose Lorentz symmetry on the correla-
tion function which ﬁxes it uniquely, cf.ref. [17]. For more
general geometries the correlation functions depend on con-
formal time η, i.e. G = G(η, η′). The propagator equa-
tion amounts to a diﬀerential equation for the time evolu-
tion. The explicit form of the time-dependent metric cor-
relation function (197) in three-dimensional Fourier space
constitutes for arbitrary geometries the “initial value” for
η → −∞, η′ → −∞ and small |η − η′|. For geometries
close to de Sitter space, as appropriate for inﬂationary cos-
mology, they describe the limiting behaviour of the metric
correlations for |kη| ≫ 1, |kη′| ≫ 1, |k(η − η′)| ≪ 1, with
k the comoving wave number.

1. Inverse propagator

For Einstein gravity (V = 0 in eq. (72)) the expansion
of the eﬀective action in second order in the metric ﬂuctu-
ations is given in ﬂat space, ¯gµν = ηµν =diag(−1, 1, 1, 1),

The r.h.s of eq.(131) corresponds to the unit matrix in the

˜Pµν σ

(139)

(140)

(141)

one has ˆSµν = ˜Pµν /3. Contractions with the transversal
projector obey the simple properties

˜P µν tµν = 0 , ˜P µν fµν = σ.

(142)

The metric correlation (137), (138) can be decomposed
into contributions from the diﬀerent irreducible Lorentz
representations. For the scalar part we infer

Here hσσic symbolizes the relation

hσ(q)σ(−q′)ic = Gσσδ(q − q′).

(145)

(146)

These Lorentz invariant Green’s functions correspond to
particular solutions of the propagator equation (106).

We may employ the projector on the traceless and diver-

gence free part of the metric ﬂuctuations,

P (t)

µνρτ =

Using the projector properties (154) one veriﬁes easily that
eqs.(156),(155) obey the propagator equation.

5. Irreducible representations of rotation
symmetry

With respect to the subgroup of space-rotations the trace
σ transforms as a scalar. The part tµν can be reduced to
tensor, vector and scalar components, γmn, Wm and κ,

tmn = γmn −

(158)

We can further decompose the metric correlation function
into contributions from diﬀerent representations of the ro-
tation symmeetry. This will be useful for the matching
with more general geometries that represent homogeneous
and isotropic cosmologies, but no longer exhibit Lorentz
symmetry.

For the scalar part of the transversal correlation function

we deﬁne

6. Eﬀective action for physical metric ﬂuctuations
So far we have computed the correlation function by ﬁrst
deriving the form (115) of Γ(2) for arbitrary metric ﬂuctu-
ations hµν , and subsequently inverting it on the space of
functions fµν. The resulting Green’s function was then de-
composed into irreducible representations of the symmetry
groups. One may also proceed more directly by inserting
hµν = tµν +sµν directly in Γ2, decomposing into irreducible
representations, taking functional derivatives with respect
to these independent representations and performing the
inversion at the end. We brieﬂy show here that the two
procedures are equivalent.

We ﬁrst employ that the pieces for tµν and σ decouple

(162)

in Γ2,

Here we employ the three dimensional projector

These expressions are easily inverted. The corresponding

(143) and (146).

For comparison it is also instructive to decompose fµν

into a trace and traceless part

(167)

We observe that Gγγ
µνρτ vanishes if at least one of the indices
equals zero, and GW W
µνρτ is nonzero only for the index combi-
nations (µνρτ ) = (m0n0), (m0np), (mpn0), (mpnq), with
permutations according to the symmetries µ → ν, ρ ↔ τ
and (µν) ↔ (ρτ ). All mixed terms vanish, such that

Gµνρτ = Gσσ

µνρτ + Gκκ

µνρτ + GW W

µνρτ + Gγγ

(168)

It is straightforward to verify this by a direct computation.

(176)

One should recall, however, that bµν is not unconstrained,
cf. eq.(79), such that the σ-propagator cannot be obtained
by variation of eq.(176) at ﬁxed bµν.

7. Eﬀective action for scalar, vector and graviton
modes

We can further decompose Γ(t)
2

into pieces corresponding

to the irreducible representations of the rotation group,

14

“gauge invariant” Bardeen potentials [9] Φ and Ψ, and to
employ the gauge invariant vector ﬂuctuation

is independent of ω. This shows that Ωm is not a propa-
gating degree of freedom, but rather a constrained ﬁeld.
The Bardeen potentials are given by (cf. appendix D)

The Green’s functions Gκκ, GW W and Gγγ follow by simple
inversion and coincide with eqs. (159), (161) and (167).

8. Gauge invariant Bardeen potentials

The physical metric ﬂuctuations fµν or γmn, Wm, κ and
σ are “gauge invariant” in the same sense as the well known
Bardeen potentials, i.e. that they are not aﬀected by an
inﬁnitesimal diﬀeomorphism transformation of ¯gµν .
It is
instructive to express the scalars σ and κ in terms of the

κ =

σ =

4k4
3q4 (Φ − Ψ),
2
q2(cid:2)k2Ψ + (3q2 − k2)Φ(cid:3).

(186)

The correlation functions for the Bardeen potentials read

Again, the propagator matrix in the (Φ, Ψ)-space has no
pole for k 6= 0 such that Φ and Ψ are not propagating.
The fact that the Bardeen-potentials are not propagating
implies that their mode functions vanish in the absence of
sources. This does not imply that the correlation function
of the metric in the scalar and vector channel vanishes,
as obvious from our explicit computations. This simple
ﬁnding tells us that correlations functions cannot always
be constructed as products of mode functions.

9. Time-dependent correlation functions

For cosmology one needs the metric correlation as a func-
tion of time. More precisely, the correlation function is
bilinear in the ﬁelds and therefore involves two time ar-
guments. The power spectrum of primordial ﬂuctuations
is given by the equal-time correlation function where the
two time arguments coincide. In general, geometries rel-
evant for cosmology do not show time translation invari-
ance. Correlation functions are speciﬁed by initial condi-
tions. Under many circumstances these initial values can
be given by the Lorentz-invariant correlation function in
ﬂat space. This holds if the relevant momentum of the

We observe the negative value of the equal time correlation

This allows us to compute all components of the full metric
correlation (137), (138), e.g.

mode is much larger than all geometric scales given by
curvature etc..

For the time translation invariant correlation in ﬂat
space G only depends on the diﬀerence of the two time
arguments. Starting from the Green’s function in four-
dimensional Fourier space derived previously, the depen-
dence of the correlation function on time obtains by a
Fourier transform

Here we use the symbol η for conformal time in view of later
comparison with a homogeneous and isotropic background.
(For ﬂat space with a = 1 one has t = η.) The time
translation symmetry is reﬂected by a time dependence
only involving the diﬀerence η − η′. Analytic continuation
replaces ω → ω(1 + iǫ), q2 → k2 − ω2 − 2iǫω2, and the
determinant √g = i(1 + iǫ). We deﬁne the ω-integration
as the limit ǫ → 0 of the analytically continued integration.
This ﬁxes the integration contour around the poles of the
propagator. (See ref. [17] for a motivation of this procedure
for the context of cosmology.) For example, one has

10. Propagator with gauge ﬁxing

So far we have discussed the correlation function for the
metric by restricting to the physical metric ﬂuctuations and
employing the corresponding projector P (f ) in the propa-
gator equation. An equivalent description of this correla-
tion function can be found in a gauge ﬁxed version if the
gauge ﬁxing enforces vanishing gauge ﬂuctuations, aµν = 0.
(This does not hold for arbitrary gauge ﬁxing.) For our
purpose we may employ the gauge ﬁxing

In the limit β → 0 the contribution from Ggf to the metric
correlation (206) vanishes. We recover the result based
on a formulation in terms of constrained physical metric
ﬂuctuations.

(211)

and take the limit β → 0 at the end.
In the presence of gauge ﬁxing we can consider uncon-
strained metric ﬂuctuations hµν . The metric correlation is
deﬁned for arbitrary hµν and depends, in general, on the
gauge ﬁxing. The gauge ﬁxing (203) adds to Γ(2) in eq.

the propagator equation for Gph is given by eq.(131).

VI. Homogeneous and isotropic

cosmology

In this section we turn to the discussion of the metric
correlation function in cosmology. We assume a homoge-
neous and isotropic background geometry with vanishing
spacial curvature. For the propagating graviton the gen-
eral solution of the propagator equation can be described
in terms of mode functions. Their normalization is only
restricted by the inhomogeneous term in the propagator
equation - no explicit quantum ﬁeld operators and asso-
ciated commutation relations are needed [18], [17]. The
mode functions coincide with the solution of the linearized
Einstein equations only in the case where the background
geometry obeys the ﬁeld equations. For the vector and
scalar modes contained in the metric the propagator equa-
tion cannot always be solved by mode functions.

1. Metric ﬂuctuations for homogeneous and

isotropic cosmology
A homogeneous and isotropic background metric with

zero spatial curvature can be written in the form

¯gµν = a2(η)ηµν , H(η) =

∂ ln a(η)

∂η

,

(217)

with η conformal time and a(η) the scale factor. Ana-
lytic continuation can be easily implemented by admitting
a complex phase factor for η00 such that η00 = −1 for
Minkowski signature and η00 = 1 for euclidean signature.
We will assume that η extends from −∞ to +∞, as typi-
cal for realistic cosmologies. We also assume that boundary
terms can be neglected in the sense that partial integration
for η-dependent functions can be performed.

For certain limiting cases as de Sitter space the scale

factor may diverge at ﬁnite η, e.g.

a = −

1
Hη

, H = −

1
η

.

(218)

17

Since the propagator equation is local in η and the cor-
relation function is ﬁxed by initial values for a diﬀeren-
tial equation, this formal continuation does not matter
for the correlation function for arguments η, η′ obeying
|η/ǫ| ≫ 1,|η′/ǫ| ≫ 1.
the three space dimensions, e.g.

It is convenient to perform a Fourier transformation in

fµν(x) = fµν(η, ~x) =Z

d3k
(2π)3 ei~k~xfµν(η, ~k),

(220)

and similar for other ﬁelds. We assume space-translation
symmetry of the correlation functions. The propagator
equation can then be decomposed into separate equations
for each k-mode.

For a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology the scalar

covariant Laplacian reads explicitly

D2σ = −a−2(∂2

η + 2H∂η + k2)σ,

(221)

with k2 = δmnkmkn = a2kmkm. For the components of
σ;µν one ﬁnds

η > 0 by taking the limit ǫ → 0 for

R00 = −3∂ηH , Rmn = (2H2 + ∂ηH)δmn,
R =

a2 (H2 + ∂ηH).

(226)

Equipped with these relations one may try to solve the
propagator equation (106) for homogeneous isotropic ge-
ometries. The complications of this task arise from the
mixing of diﬀerent components in eq.(223).

2. Mode functions

In cosmology correlation functions are often assumed to
be a product of mode functions. These mode functions are
solutions of the linearized Einstein equations or suitable
generalizations. The normalization is then provided by free
quantum ﬁelds in an appropriate vacuum. Given our basic
formulation of the correlation function as a solution of the
propagator equation we can investigate systematically the
conditions for this ansatz to work or fail.

Space-translation invariant Green’s functions take in

Fourier space the form

Gρτ σλ(η, ~k; η′, ~k′) = Gρτ σλ(~k, η, η′)δ(k − k′),

(227)

where

e−i(~k~x−~k′~y)Gρτ σλ(η, ~x; η′, ~y)

Gρτ σλ(η, ~k; η′, ~k′) =Zx,y
(228)
and δ(k − k′) = (2π)3δ3(~k − ~k′). Similarly, for a homoge-
neous background metric ¯gµν(η, ~x) = ¯gµν(η) the operator
Γ(2) is diagonal in momentum space,

Γ(2)µνρτ (η′, ~k′; η, ~k) = Γ(2)µνρτ (~k, η′, η)δ(k − k′).

(229)

For our purposes it can be written as a diﬀerential operator
Dη acting on η (cf. eq. (76))

Γ(2)µνρσ(~k, η′, η) = δ(η − η′)Dµνρτ

(η)

(~k).

(230)

The propagator equation (66) takes then the form

Dµνρτ

(η)

(~k)Gρτ σλ(~k, η, η′) = Eµν

σλ(~k, η, η′),

(231)

where the Fourier transform of Eµν
σλ(x, y) is given by
σλ(~k, η, η′)δ(k − k′). This is a system of independent
Eµν
diﬀerential equations for each value of ~k. Rotation symme-
try imposes further constraints on D(η) and G.

σλ(~k, η, η′) is given by the projector P (f )µν

If the inhomogeneous term in the propagator equation is
proportional δ(η − η′) we can solve this equation in terms
of mode functions. For the physical metric ﬂuctuations
σλ(~k, η, η′),
Eµν
which does not necessarily vanish for η 6= η′, cf. eq. (201).
(An exception is the graviton mode.) For solving the prop-
agator equation in terms of mode functions we have two op-
tions. Either one works with unconstrained metric ﬂuctu-
ations and includes in ¯Dη a gauge ﬁxing term as described
in appendix A. In this case the mode equation reads

Dµνρτ

(η) hρτ = 0,

(232)

where the deﬁnition of D(η) in eq. (230) includes the con-
tribution to Γ(2) from the gauge ﬁxing term. As an alterna-
tive, one may decompose the physical metric ﬂuctuations

18

into unconstrained representations of the rotation group,
for which the propagator equation takes the form

D(η)(~k)G(~k, η, η′) = δ(η − η′).

(233)

Here D(η) and G are N ×N matrices with N the dimension
of the representation, and we have not written explicitly
the unit matrix on the r.h.s.. For rotation symmetric corre-
lation functions diﬀerent irreducible SO(3)-representations
do not mix and can be treated separately. (There may be,
however, several representations of the same type.)

Let us assume a propagator equation of the type (233).
For η 6= η′ the diﬀerential equation (233) is homogeneous.
The (generalized) mode functions w(α)(~k, η) are a set of
linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equa-
tion

D(η)(~k)w(α)(~k, η) = 0,

(234)

such that the most general solution to the mode equation

D(η)(~k) ˜w(~k, η) = 0

(235)

can be written in the form

˜w(~k, η) =Xα

cα(~k)w(α)(~k, η).

(236)

A given mode function w(α) is a N -component vector and
eqs. (234)-(236) are vector equations. For purely real or
imaginary D(η) the functions w(α)∗ also obey eq.
(234)
and we can equally well expand the general solution of eq.
(235) in terms of w(α)∗.

We will next show that the general solution of the propa-
gator equation (233) can be expressed in terms of the mode
functions as

Gst(~k, η, η′) = Xα,β(cid:8)dαβ(~k)w(α)

t

(~k, η′)Θ(η − η′)
(~k, η′)Θ(η′ − η)(cid:9)

(237)

The coeﬃcients dαβ (~k) will be constrained by the inhomo-
geneous term in eq. (233) and by symmetries. They can
be viewed as a hermitean matrix

βα(~k) = dαβ(~k).
d∗

(238)

The Green’s function is symmetric,

G(~k, η, η′) = GT (~k, η′, η).

(239)

For η 6= η′ it can be written as

G(~k, η, η′) = G(s)(~k, η, η′)

+G(a)(~k, η, η′)(cid:0)θ(η − η′) − θ(η′ − η)(cid:1), (240)

with G(s) and G(a) symmetric and antisymmetric, respec-
tively. Furthermore, the reality condition implies that for
Minkowski signature both G(s) and G(a) are hermitean.

Thus G(s) is real and G(a) purely imaginary. This implies
eq. (238). For η 6= η′ both G(s) and G(a) obey separately
the homogeneous equation

D(η)(~k)Gs,a(~k, η, η′) = 0.

(241)

Using eq.
dependence on η′

(239) this implies a similar equation for the

D(η′)(~k)G(s,a)(~k, η, η′) = 0.

(242)

It is now straightforward to show eq. (237). Eqs. (241)

and (235), (236) imply for η > η′

Gst(~k, η, η′) = ˜cα,t(~k, η′)w(α)

s

(~k, η),

(243)

where ˜cα,t are N -component vectors for each α. Using eq.
(242) we infer from eq. (235), (236)

˜cα,t(~k, η′) =Xβ

dαβ(~k)w(β)∗

t

(~k, η′).

(244)

This establishes eq. (237) for η > η′. The behavior for
η′ < η follows by eq. (239). With eq. (238) we conclude
for Fst = 0 that the real part of G is continuous at η = η′,
while the imaginary parts jumps.

(η) , with D(R)

We next turn to the inhomogeneous term in the prop-
agator equation (231). We concentrate ﬁrst on Fst = 0.
The operator D(η) contains a factor √¯g = ia4 and can be
written as D(η) = iD(R)
(η) a real diﬀerential op-
erator. The inhomogeneous term on the r.h.s of eq. (231)
is real. It is therefore related to the behavior of the purely
imaginary part of G, as given by G(a). Indeed, this imag-
inary part shows a discontinuity at η = η′, cf. eq. (240),
which can produce the inhomogeneous term. In contrast,
the propagator equation for the real part G(s) is homoge-
neous for all η and η′. We conclude that G(s) and G(a)
obey separate propagator equations

¯DηG(s) = 0,

(245)

¯Dη(cid:8)G(a) sign (η − η′)(cid:9) = δ(η − η′).

The linear equation for G(s) does not ﬁx its amplitude, al-
lowing typically for a large variety of solutions of the prop-
agator equation. The correlation function will therefore
be uniquely determined only once boundary conditions are
speciﬁed. The issue has been discussed extensively in ref.
[17].

As an example we consider an operator of the form

19

Diﬀerential equations of this type apply for operators of
the type (76), whereby the functions A,B,C may diﬀer for
the diﬀerent SO(3)-representations contained in hµν (see
later). For the graviton the normalization of dαβ inferred
from eq. (248) corresponds to the normalization following
from the commutator relations for free quantum ﬁelds. On
the level of the quantum eﬀective action it is a direct con-
sequence of the basic identity (66) and only involves prop-
erties of “classical ﬁelds”. No operators and commutation
relations are involved in our formalism.

For an operator D(η) containing two η-derivatives the
general solution of the mode equation (235) involves two
linearly independent mode functions for each component
of the vector ws. They can be related by complex con-
jugation. For irreducible representations of the rotation
group the solutions are degenerate and related by symme-
try. Our boundary conditions, that can be related to prop-
erties under analytic continuation [17], typically admit only
one independent mode function for each irreducible repre-
sentation. If we restrict the setting to the physical metric
ﬂuctuations the diﬀerential operator D(η) will typically ad-
mit more than one independent mode function for a given
irreducible representation. The sum (237) can no longer be
written as a product of a given mode function w(η)w∗(η′).
An exception is the graviton for which D(η) remains second
order.

The most general solution of the propagator equation
may also contain a term −iFstδ(η − η′). This does not
contribute for η 6= η′, but it can contribute to the solution
of the inhomogeneous equation. A simple example is

D(η) = iA(η)δst , Fst =

1
A(η)

δst,

(249)

where A(η) contains no η-derivatives, e.g. A(η) = k2. If
A(η) has no zero, the mode equation D(η) ˜w = 0 has only
the trivial solution w = 0 such that for η 6= η′ G(s) =
G(a) = 0. The propagator (237) therefore only involves the
term −iFstδ(η − η′). It cannot be written as a product of
mode functions or a sum of such products. More generally,
the contribution of Fst to the inhomogeneous term is

(250)

− iD(η)(cid:2)F δ(η − η′)(cid:3) = f (η, η′)δ(η − η′).

We conclude that the use of mode functions for the corre-
lations of the physical metric ﬂuctuations is more involved
than for a single scalar ﬁeld (or the graviton). Mode func-
tions can only be employed if the inhomogeneous term is
∼ δ(η−η′), as realized for unconstrained ﬁelds. Expressing
the propagator equation in terms of unconstrained physical
ﬂuctuations typically leads to higher other diﬀerential op-
erators D(η). Furthermore, one may encounter additional
terms ∼ δ(η − η′) in the correlation function that cannot
be expressed by sums over products of mode functions. An
alternative may be the explicit use of gauge ﬁxing. Still,
the issue remains rather involved due to the presence of a
large number of diﬀerent mode functions.

D(η) = iA(η)(cid:2)∂2

η + 2C(η)∂η + B(η)(cid:3),

with real functions A(η),B(η),C(η). The equation
D(η)nG(a)(η, η′)(cid:2)θ(η − η′)− θ(η′ − η)(cid:3)o = δ(η − η′) (247)

is obeyed for

The mode functions are usually associated to the so-

ground metric ¯gµν is a solution of the “background” ﬁeld
equation this indeed coincides with the more general def-
inition (234). For background geometries not obeying the
ﬁeld equations this simple coincidence is no longer valid.
We compute here the mode equations for the eﬀective ac-
tion (72). We recall however, that the resulting mode func-
tions in the scalar and vector channel cannot be used for
the construction of the correlation function.

For the action (72) and in the absence of any further con-
tributions to Tµν one has

T(1)µν = −V hµν.

(253)

Solutions of the background ﬁeld equation relate ¯Rµν to V .
We may evaluate the mode equation (232) for physical

metric ﬂuctuations fµν,

Γ(2)µνρτ (x, y)fρτ (y) = 0.

(254)

Zy

This may be compared to the solution of the linearized Ein-
stein equation (252), (253), also evaluated for hµν = fµν.
We show in appendix C that the two equations for fµν only
coincide if the background metric obeys the ﬁeld equations.
Otherwise, the solution of the mode equation (254) diﬀers
from the solution of the linearized Einstein equation. The
origin of this diﬀerence arises from the relation of the ﬁrst
functional derivative δΓ/δgµν and the Einstein equation,
which involves a factor g1/2gµρgντ . The linearization of
the ﬁrst functional derivative has to take this factor into
account.

For a homogeneous and isotropic background (217) we
may further elaborate the linearized Einstein equation. For
a vanishing Weyl tensor ¯Cµνρτ = 0 one has for the physical
metric ﬂuctuations fµν

In particular, for a de Sitter background one has ∂ηH = H2
such that eq. (258) only involves σ. Also the trace of T(1)µν
depends only on σ

=

a2T(1)µν ¯gµν = −a2V σ.

For a solution of the background ﬁeld equation,

3H2 =

the mode equation for σ therefore becomes
(∂2
η + 2H∂η − 3H2 + k2)σ = 0.

(259)

(260)

(261)

The mode equations for the other components of the
metric are somewhat more involved. One ﬁrst uses the
relation bµν = tµν + ˜sµν, eq.(84),
in order to combine
eqs.(252),(253),(257) into a coupled system of diﬀerential
equations for tµν and σ. Finding solutions of this linearized
Einstein equation will be facilitated if we decompose the
metric ﬂuctuations into irreducible representations of the
rotation group.

4. Projectors

The projectors P (f ) and P (a) on physical or gauge ﬂuc-
tuations are in Fourier space functions of km, and involve a
unit matrix δ(k− k′). They depend on two time arguments
η and η′, e.g.

P (a)

5. Mode equations with gauge ﬁxing

One possibility for constructing the correlation function
from solutions of the mode equation employs an explicit
gauge ﬁxing term

Γgf =

1

2β Zx

¯g1/2hν

µ;νhµρ

;ρ.

(269)

This adds to Γ(2) in eq. (76) a term

Γ(2)µνρτ
gf

1
4β

√¯g{¯gµρDνDτ + ¯gνρDµDτ

= −
+ ¯gµτ Dν Dρ + ¯gντ DµDρ}.

(270)
In the limit β → 0 the second functional derivative Γ(2) is
dominated by Γ(2)
gf .

For the computation of the mode functions we split

hµν = fµν + aµν

fµν;

ν = 0 , aµν;

ν = Aµ.

The leading order mode equation

Γ(2)µνρτ
gf

fρτ = 0

(271)

(272)

is obeyed for arbitrary physical metric ﬂuctuations. For
the “gauge modes” aρτ the leading order mode equation

Γ(2)µνρτ
gf

aρτ = 0

(273)

Aj = ikjL + Tj , kjTj = 0,
(∂η − 2H) L + A0 = 0,
(∂η − 2H) Tj = 0,
i (klTj + kjTl) − 2HδjlA0 − 2klkj L = 0.
Combining eqs.(278), (279) one obtains for ~k 6= 0

A0 = 0, L = 0,

Tj = 0.

(280)

Discarding the special case ~k = 0 we conclude that the only
solution is

Aµ = 0.

(281)

The remaining leading order mode equation for the vector
aµ,

D2aµ + Dν Dµaν = 0,

(282)

obtains from eq.(276) by insertion of aµν = aµ;ν + aν;µ.
By virtue of eq.(272) the full mode equation becomes

Γ(2)µνρτ
ph

(fρτ + aρτ ) + Γ(2)µνρτ

gf

aρτ = 0,

(283)

with Γ(2)µνρτ
given by eq.(76). For β → 0 all possible solu-
tions will have aρτ ∼ β. We can therefore neglect the term
Γ(2)
ph a even in the case that this term does not vanish any-
how. As a result, the mode equation for the physical metric
ﬂuctuations obtains a non-vanishing source term from the
gauge modes

Γ(2)µνρτ
ph

fρτ = −Γ(2)µνρτ

gf

aρτ .

(284)

It can be solved if both sides of eq.(284) vanish separately.
In this case the leading order mode functions for aρτ are
combined with the solutions of the linearized Einstein equa-
tions (252),(257). These solutions are, however, not the
most general solutions of eq.(284). For the construction
of the correlation function from mode functions the most
general solution is needed.

VII. Mode decomposition

and

The solution of mode equations or the expression of the
eﬀective action in terms of unconstrained ﬁelds is facili-
tated if we decompose the metric ﬂuctuations into repre-
sentations of the rotation group. We proceed here to a sep-
arate decomposition of the physical metric ﬂuctuations and
the gauge ﬂuctuations. The connection to other, perhaps
more familiar decompositions is established in appendix D.
In this appendix we also display the relation between the
vector and scalar parts of the physical metric ﬂuctuations
to the Bardeen potentials.

1. Decomposition of physical metric ﬂuctuations
into SO(3)-representations

Similar to ﬂat space, we decompose the physical metric
ﬂuctuations into irreducible representations of the rotation
group SO(3),

fµν = tµν + ˆSµν σ = tµν + sµν,

(285)

with

t00 = a2κ,

amounts to

ǫ =

(295)

(288)

which entails for de Sitter space the relation

3. Decomposition for gauge ﬂuctuations

The gauge ﬂuctuations aµν = aµ;ν +aν;µ can be obtained
from a vector aµ. We decompose aµ into two scalars a0 and
r and a divergence free vector Um,

am = ikmr + Um,

kmUm = 0.

(312)

This yields for aµν

a00 = 2D0a0 = 2 (∂η − H) a0,
am0 = ikm [a0 + (∂η − 2H) r] + (∂η − 2H) Um,
amn = i (kmUn + knUm) − 2kmknr − 2Hδmna0,
δmnamn = −2k2r − 6Ha0.

(313)

The leading order mode equations for a0, r and Um follow

from eq.(276) with Aµ = 0,

η − 8H2 − 2∂ηH + k2(cid:1) a0 + (∂η − 4H) k2r = 0, (314)

VIII. Graviton correlation in de Sitter

space

In this section we discuss the graviton propagator in a
de Sitter geometry. The graviton corresponds to the trace-
less and divergence free metric ﬂuctuations γmn.
If the
background obeys the ﬁeld equations we recover the stan-
dard results of perturbation theory for linear cosmic ﬂuc-
tuations. This section therefore links directly the formal
concepts developed in the present paper to cosmological
observation and earlier theoretical work. The graviton cor-
relation can be constructed from mode functions.

The metric component corresponding to the graviton ob-
tains from a general metric ﬂuctuation by a particularly
simple projection

(315)

The projector P (γ) is given by eq.(180) if all indices are
spacelike and vanishes for all other index combinations. Its
time dependence is a simple unit matrix δ(η − η′). Indeed,
one has for arbitrary metrics of the form (217) the relations

1. Evolution equation for graviton propagator

We ﬁrst derive the general propagator equation for the
graviton correlation. The most general graviton correla-
tion is speciﬁed by initial values for the solution of this
diﬀerential equation. The eﬀective action (306) for γmn in-
volves only two time derivatives and one ﬁnds directly the

(335)

In the limit u, u′ → −∞ (η, η′ → −∞) the graviton corre-

(343)

(For geometries neighbouring de Sitter space the mode
functions and therefore the power spectrum and nT are
modiﬁed.) As long as k/a remains much smaller than H
the time independent power spectrum

Ggrav =

(344)

remains unmodiﬁed. Once a given k-mode “enters the hori-
zon”, k/a ≫ H, it starts again the damped oscillation
(336). The resulting tensor power spectrum is accessible
to observation if the amplitude is large enough.

The formulae after eq.(335) are the standard ones used
in cosmology. We have displayed them here in order to
demonstrate that for appropriate initial conditions the
graviton correlation, as obtained by a solution of the exact
propagator equation (3), coincides with the one obtained
from the normalization of a free quantum ﬁeld in a Bunch
Davies vacuum. The vector and scalar part of the metric
correlation has no such simple interpretation in terms of
free quantum ﬁelds.

IX. Conclusions

For a(η) = a(η′) = 1 this coincides with the ﬂat space cor-
relation (190). In the opposite limit u, u′ → 0 the graviton
propagator reaches a constant amplitude

Ggrav(k, η, η′) =

(337)

This paper addresses mainly the conceptual issues of the
metric correlation function in quantum gravity and cos-
mology. The recipe mainly employed in cosmology, namely
the construction of the correlation function as a product of
mode functions or a sum of such products, cannot be ap-
plied in general. There are simple cases where the mode

functions vanish in the vector and scalar channel, while the
correlation function diﬀers from zero. We therefore have
to build our discussion from a more basic level, using the
deﬁning diﬀerential equation for the Green’s function. The
diﬀerential operator in this equation is given by the second
functional derivative of the quantum eﬀective action Γ(2).
The relation between Γ(2) and the correlation function G
is exact. Approximations only concern the precise form of
the eﬀective action.

The ﬁrst question to address concerns the physical mean-
In a gauge ﬁxed
ing of the metric correlation function.
version of quantum gravity this correlation function de-
pends manifestly on the chosen gauge ﬁxing. One may
therefore question to which extent the metric correlation
is a meaningful physical object. We propose here to dis-
tinguish between physical metric ﬂuctuations that couple
to a conserved energy momentum tensor, and gauge ﬂuc-
tuations that are generated by gauge transformations of a
given cosmological solution. The physical metric ﬂuctua-
tions are conceptually similar to the Bardeen potentials, in
the sense that they are invariant with respect to inﬁnites-
imal diﬀeomorphism transformations of the “background
metric”. The physical metric ﬂuctuations are directly for-
mulated on the level of the metric in a covariant way. This
diﬀers from the Bardeen potentials. We establish the for-
mal relations between the physical metric ﬂuctuations and
the Bardeen potentials.

The object of our interest is the correlation function for
the physical metric ﬂuctuations. It can be obtained by re-
stricting in the functional integral the sources to “physical
sources” that correspond to a conserved energy momentum
tensor. The argument of the eﬀective action involves then
only the physical metric ﬂuctuations, not the gauge ﬂuctu-
ations. As a result, the relation between physical sources
and physical metric ﬂuctuations is invertible and the eﬀec-
tive action can be constructed in a standard way. No gauge
ﬁxing is needed for the inversion of the second functional
derivative Γ(2). The correlation function for the physical
metric ﬂuctuations can also be found using a standard pro-
cedure with gauge ﬁxing. The gauge ﬁxing is not arbitrary,
however. It has to enforce the condition for physical metric
ﬂuctuations, hν
µ;ν = 0. We show explicitly the equivalence
between the restriction to physical sources and ﬁelds on
one side, and the appropriate gauge ﬁxed formalism on the
other side.

With all quantities well deﬁned the metric correlation
function G obtains as a solution of the propagator equation
(3). Conceptually, its computation amounts to the inver-
sion of the diﬀerential operator Γ(2). We are interested to
solve this inversion problem for geometries corresponding
to realistic cosmologies. Even for a rather simple form of
the eﬀective action, as given by the Einstein-Hilbert ac-
tion with a cosmological constant, the inversion of Γ(2) is
a complex task. The operator Γ(2) contains only up to two
time derivatives ∂η. It is, however, a matrix in the space
of physical metric ﬂuctuations and involves projections.

In quantum gravity computations the inversion of Γ(2)
is a standard task. It is usually done for some particular
gauge ﬁxing (unfortunately often not compatible with the

26

projection on physical metric ﬂuctuations) and for simple
Euclidean geometries as the sphere or ﬂat space, or geome-
tries close to those [36]. We are interested to obtain the
metric correlations for geometries close to de Sitter space,
as relevant for cosmology. This needs a computation with
Minkowski signature, for which the solution of the prop-
agator equation becomes an initial value problem. One
may think of obtaining the metric propagator in de Sit-
ter space by analytic continuation from a corresponding
Euclidean geometry. This corresponding geometry is the
maximally symmetric space with negative curvature [17],
and little is known about the metric correlation in such a
hyperbolic space. (The analytic continuation of the sphere
is anti de Sitter space, both having a discrete spectrum
diﬀering qualitatively from the continuous spectrum in de
Sitter space.)
The present paper provides the formalism for the compu-
tation of the metric correlation in de Sitter space and other
homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies, to which we will
turn in a separate publication. The extensive discussion
of the metric correlation in ﬂat space establishes several
important features in an explicit way. The scalar and vec-
tor part of the metric correlation function does not vanish
despite the fact that the solution of the linearized Ein-
stein equation leads to vanishing scalar and vector Bardeen
potentials. The vector and scalar part of the metric cor-
relation cannot be found from solutions of the linearized
Einstein equations. They rather involve the inversion of
operators with up to four (vector) or up to six (scalar)
derivatives. This results in the secular behaviour (197).
For realistic cosmologies we will be interested in initial
values of the metric correlations that correspond to the
time-translation symmetric correlations in ﬂat space. Our
discussion of the ﬂat space correlation functions provides
those initial conditions.

For an explicit computation of the metric correlation
for realistic cosmologies several diﬀerent, but equivalent,
strategies may be followed. One may derive the propaga-
tor equation for Wm and κ from eqs.(308),(310). This is
straightforward, and the unit operator in the correspond-
ing function space is ∼ δ(η − η′). (In the case of Wm it
involves a k-dependent projector.) The complexity in this
approach arises from the fact that the diﬀerential operators
to be inverted involve up to four (Wm) or six (κ) deriva-
tives. As an alternative, one may compute the explicit form
of projectors and solve eq.(106). The inhomogeneous term
on the right hand side involves now projectors that depend
on η and η′ in the case of vector and scalar modes. Finally,
one may employ a gauge ﬁxed version and solve eq.(284).
The complexity arises here from the high number of cou-
pled modes - two vectors and four scalars.

The merit of such a calculation will be to shed light on
the infrared structure of the physical metric propagator in
realistic cosmologies. This should help to understand bet-
ter several important issues in quantum gravity, as related
to locality, anomalies or the possible existence [35] of an
infrared ﬁxed point.

Appendix A: Projectors and gauge ﬁxing

In this appendix we recall a few general features of pro-
jectors and gauge ﬁxing that are useful for our discussion.
Let us consider two matrices D and G obeying

DG = 1.

(A.1)

Here D corresponds to Γ(2) and G to the correlation func-
tion. Assume further the existence of a projector P ,

P 2 = P , (1 − P )2 = (1 − P ) , P (1 − P ) = 0.

(A.2)

and

We may then decompose

27

For a second important case we consider a family of ma-
trices Dβ for which D−− is multiplied by a factor 1
β . We
keep the notation G+−, G−− etc.
for the solutions of eq.
(A.1) for β = 1, and denote the solutions for arbitrary β
with G(β)
−+ etc.. Consider now small β. The compo-
nents G(β)
−+ have to scale ∼ β (or they vanish).
In the limit β → 0 we can neglect them, resulting in

+−, G(β)
−− and G(β)

D++G(β)

++ = P †,

D++G(β)

+− = 0.

(A.11)

(A.12)

D = D++ + D+− + D−+ + D−−,

(A.3)

If G(β) is unique the second equation implies that G(β)
+−
vanishes. One ends with

with

D++ = P †DP , D+− = P †D(1 − P ),
D−+ = (1 − P †)DP , D−− = (1 − P †)D(1 − P ),

(A.4)

and similarly for G

G++ = P GP †, G+− = P G(cid:0)1 − P †(cid:1)
G−+ = (1 − P ) GP †, G−− = (1 − P ) G(cid:0)1 − P †(cid:1) .
Insertion into eq. (A.1) and multiplying eq. (A.1) with
suitable factors P and (1 − P ) from left and right yields
the relations

(A.5)

D++G++ + D+−G−+ = P †,
D−−G−− + D−+G+− = 1 − P †,
D++G+− + D+−G−− = 0,
D−−G−+ + D−+G++ = 0.

(A.6)

For our discussion two simple cases are of importance.

For the ﬁrst D is block diagonal, D+− = D−+ = 0,

D = D++ + D−−.

(A.7)

Then G++ and G−− obey

D++G++ = P †,
D−−G−− = 1 − P †.

(A.8)

If D++ is invertible once projected on the appropriate sub-
space, the projected propagator G++ is its inverse. The
remaining equations

G(β) = G(β)
++.

(A.13)

The correlation function diﬀers from zero only in the sub-
space of eigenvalues of P with unit eigenvalue.

In a gauge ﬁxed version of the eﬀective action one adds to
gf . Let us assume for sim-
gf is regular. We further

Γ(2) a gauge ﬁxing term (1/β)¯Γ(2)
plicity that Γ(2) = ¯Γ(2) + (1/β)¯Γ(2)
assume that ¯Γ(2)

gf can be written in terms of a projector
¯Γ(2)
gf = (1 − P †) ˜D−−(1 − P ).
In the limit β → 0 one therefore arrives at
G = G++ , D++G++ = P †.

(A.15)

(A.14)

In other words, the non-vanishing part of the correlation
function involves only the modes with eigenvalues one of P .
They can be viewed as ﬂuctuations obeying a constraint.
The operator D++ corresponds to Γ(2) subject to this con-
straint, and G++ is the inverse of Γ(2) on the subspace of
the constrained ﬂuctuations. The formulation in terms of
the physical metric ﬂuctuations fµν obeying the constraint
f ν
µ;ν = 0, that we employ in this paper, is equivalent to a
gauge ﬁxed version in the limit β → 0. In case where the
projector P (f ) on fµν is not known explicitly (or in case
of ambiguities) we will deﬁne the correlation function G++
by the limit β → 0 of a gauge ﬁxed version.

In more detail we consider

(A.16)

D++G+− = 0 , D−−G−+ = 0

(A.9)

It adds to Γ(2) a term of the type discussed before, e.g.

have the solution

G+− = 0 , G−+ = 0,

(A.10)

for which G is block diagonal. If D is regular and there-
fore G is unique, the solution (A.9) is the only solution. In
contrast, if D is a diﬀerential operator for which a unique
solution of eq. (A.1) requires the speciﬁcation of initial val-
ues or boundary conditions, eq. (A.10) does not necessarily
hold.

ﬂuctuations fµν ,

f ν
µ;ν = 0 , P (f )
µν

ρτ hρτ = fµν.

(A.18)

In the presence of the gauge ﬁxing the second functional
derivative Γ(2) is invertible if suitable boundary conditions

are imposed. (We discard here the zero-momentum modes
k = 0 which would need a separate discussion.) Also ˜D−−
is invertible on the subspace of “longitudinal ﬂuctuations”,
deﬁned by the modes with zero eigenvalues of P (f ). We can
then take the limit β → 0 and obtain the correlation func-
tion G++ for the “physical ﬂuctuations” fµν. The “gauge
parts” of the correlation function vanish in this limit, jus-
tifying the restriction to the physical ﬂuctuations.

These general considerations can easily be followed ex-
plicitly in ﬂat space. In momentum space P = P (f ) is real,

case later. According to the decomposition (B.1) we write

2. Decomposition of physical metric ﬂuctuations

The decomposition into trace and traceless parts remains
valid if we impose the constraint hν
µ;ν = 0 for the metric
physical ﬂuctuations. This replaces in eqs. (B.1) hµν →
fµν, ˜bµν → bµν , h → σ, with bµν = P (b)
ρτ fρτ . The ﬁelds
bµν and σ are no longer independent, however, due to the
relation bν

µν

We ﬁrst insert the decomposition hµν = bµν + σ¯gµν/4,
¯gµνbµν = 0, directly inside the eﬀective action. Taking
account of the constant hν

µ;ν = 0 one ﬁnds

µ;ν = −∂µσ/4.

The sum of all contributions equals indeed eq. (B.25), and
we see that the oﬀ-diagonal terms are necessary for this
result. While the inverse t − t-propagator (B.28) can be
directly extracted from eq. (B.24), the inverse σ − σ prop-
agator needs the term ∼ ˜sµν F ˜sµν. The inverse propagator
for σ does not coincide with the inverse propagator Γ(2)
hh for
the unconstrained ﬁeld h in eq. (B.11).

3. Scalar ﬂuctuations

The scalar part of the physical metric ﬂuctuations in-
volves the trace σ and a second scalar contained in tµν.
Their precise deﬁnition involves the contribution of σ to
bµν, i.e. the form of ˜sµν . In sect. IV we have discussed
the form of ˜sµν for background geometries with constant
curvature scalar. Alternatively, we may try the ansatz

be used for an expansion in the vicinity of maximally sym-
metric geometries.

Appendix C: Mode equation and linearized
Einstein equation

We show in this appendix that the mode functions obey
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations for small ﬂuctuations around a
background ﬁeld, provided that the background ﬁeld is it-
self a solution of the ﬁeld equations. If not, the mode func-
tions do not obey the linearized Einstein equations. We
restrict here the metric ﬂuctuations to the physical ﬂuctu-
ations fµν and we do not include contributions to the ﬁeld
equations from possible gauge ﬁxing terms.

We start with the deﬁning equation (234) for the mode
functions, with D(η) related to the second functional
derivative Γ(2) by eq. (230). The equivalence of the ﬁeld
equation (62) for ∆K µν = 0, i.e. the mode equation,

Γ(2)µνρτ fρτ = 0,

(C.1)

with the linearized ﬁeld equation around a background that
solves the ﬁeld equation is not restricted to a homogeneous
and isotropic situation. We therefore keep general fρτ and
the general form (76) for Γ(2). Since in eq. (C.1) Γ(2) acts
on fρτ the terms involving Dρ or Dτ positioned at right
do not contribute. Furthermore, one can use the general
commutator relation

[Dρ, Dµ]Aρτ = RµρAρτ − Rµρ

We emphasize, however, that for background metrics not
obeying the ﬁeld equation (C.6) the linearized Einstein
equations (252) should not be used for the deﬁnition of
the mode functions. The correct equation, which also car-
ries the information on the partial normalization of G, is
the propagator equation (231) which entails eq. (234) or
eq. (C.1). The diﬀerence results from the fact that the
ﬁrst functional derivative of the eﬀective action is given by

A simpliﬁcation of the mode equation (C.3) occurs for

Appendix D:
Decomposition of unconstrained metric
ﬂuctuations into SO(3) representations

For a homogeneous and isotropic background geometry
(217) the unconstrained metric ﬂuctuations hµν decompose
with respect to the SO(3)-rotation group as four scalars,
two divergence free vectors and the graviton. We have dis-
cussed in sect.VII the decomposition of the physical metric
ﬂuctuations (two scalars, one vector and the graviton) and
the gauge ﬂuctuations (two scalars and one vector) sepa-
rately. In this appendix we display more familiar decom-
positions of hµν and establish the connection to the decom-
position employed in the present paper. We also describe
the Bardeen potentials within the familiar decomposition
and establish their connection to the physical metric ﬂuc-
tuations in the scalar and vector sector.

1. Decomposition

We start from the familiar decomposition of general met-
µ with respect to the rotation group. In

ric ﬂuctuations hν
Fourier space it is given by

h0
0 = 2A,
hj
i = a2(γj

0 = a2(W j + ikjD) , h0

j = −(Wj + ikjD),

(D.1)

with

j = 0 , kj γj
γj

i = 0 , kjV j = 0 , kjW j = 0.

(D.2)

A restriction to ﬂuctuations obeying hν
later.

µ;ν = 0 will be done

For an explicit

scalars
A, B, C, D and the metric components one may use the
relations

In particular, one has

Comparison with eq. (D.1) yields

δA = −(∂η + H)ξ0 , δC = −Hξ0,

A = Ψ + (∂η + H)(∂ηB − D),
C = Φ + H(∂ηB − D),
W j = Ωj + (∂η + 2H)V j

(D.10)

one observes that the Bardeen potentials [9] Ψ and Φ, as
well as Ωj = Wj − ∂ηVj and γj
i , are invariant under the
inhomogeneous gauge transformations.

2. Einstein equation

In terms of these ﬁelds the linearized Einstein equations

(252) involve the ﬁrst variation of the Einstein tensor

(D.12)

(D.16)

This yields two constraints for the scalar ﬁelds

3. Physical metric ﬂuctuations

33

For the “physical degrees of freedom” we impose hν

µ;ν =

0. The components of the constraints for fµν are

f ν
0;ν = ∂ηf 0

0 + ikmf m

0 + 3Hf 0

0 − Hf m

(2HB − D).

(D.28)

Together with the two deﬁning equations (D.10) for φ and
Ψ they allow us to express A, B, C and D in terms of φ
and Ψ.

The vector constraint from eq. (D.26) reads
k2Vj = −(∂η + 4H)Wj , k2V j = −(∂η + 6H)W j. (D.29)
This expresses the gauge invariant vector ﬂuctuation Ωj in
terms of Wj,

Ωj =

1
k2 [k2 + ∂η(∂η + 4H)]Wj .

(D.30)

The relation between the Bardeen potentials and the
scalar metric ﬂuctuations A, B, C, D is rather complex for
the constraint hν
µ;ν = 0. One has to eliminate two of the
ﬁelds by using the constraint, and subsequently establish
the relation between the two remaining scalar ﬂuctuations
and the gauge invariant potentials Φ and Ψ.

In the presence of the constraints (D.28) we can relate

D to A and C as

D = 2(cid:2)k2 + 2H(∂η + 4H)(cid:3)−1(cid:2)(∂η + 3H)A− 2HC(cid:3), (D.31)

and similar for B,

The solution of this system of equations is rather simple.
(We only consider km 6= 0 here.) Multiplying eq. (D.21)
with km yields

∂ηφ = HΨ,

(D.23)

such that eqs. (D.20), (D.21) require

φ = 0 , Ψ = 0 , Ωm = 0.

The only non-vanishing mode is the graviton γmn which
obeys the standard ﬁeld equation for massless excitations

(D.25)

This mode equation is the same as for a massless scalar
ﬁeld and has been discussed extensively in the literature
[11–16].

Inversely, C and A can be expressed in terms of B and D,

B =

k2(cid:2)k2 + 2H∂η + 8H2 + 2∂ηH(cid:3)−1

(D.33)

Φ = (k2 − H∂η)B +

(D.34)

We infer

Perhaps the most convenient setting keeps A and B as

independent variables, with

and

D = 2(cid:2)k2+3H(∂η+4H)(cid:3)−1(cid:8)(∂η +3H)A−2Hk2B(cid:9) (D.35)
C =(cid:2)k2 + 3H(∂η + 4H) + 3∂ηH(cid:3)−1
×n(∂η + 4H)(∂η + 3H)A +(cid:2)k2 + (∂η + 4H)H(cid:3)k2Bo.

We can then express the Bardeen potentials Φ and Ψ in
terms of the metric components A and B,

(D.36)

Φ = (cid:2)k2 + 3H(∂η + 4H) + 3(∂ηH)(cid:3)−1
× n(∂η + 6H)(∂η + 3H)A
+(cid:2)k4 + (∂ηH)k2 − 3H2∂2

and

(D.37)

η − 6H(∂ηH + 2H2)∂η(cid:3)Bo

Ψ = (cid:2)k2 + 3H(∂η + 4H) + 3(∂ηH)(cid:3)−1

η + 11H∂η + 18H2 + 9(∂ηH)(cid:3)A

η + (5H2 + ∂ηH)∂η
(D.38)

These equations can be inverted in order to obtain A and
B, and consecutively als C and D as functions of Φ and
Ψ. In contrast to longitudinal or Newtonian gauge, where
B = D = 0, Φ = C, Ψ = A, the relation between the met-
ric components and the gauge invariant Bardeen potentials
is rather complex since inversions of diﬀerential operators
are needed. This makes the reconstruction of the metric
correlation from the correlations of Φ and Ψ rather cum-
bersome for the covariant gauge hν

µ;ν = 0.

For maximally symmetric spaces we may use the choice
(295) for ǫ and employ the relation (296).
In any case,
the relation between the Bardeen potentials and the metric
components κ and σ remains rather involved.

Appendix E: Second functional derivative
and propagator equation

In this appendix we recall a few properties of second
functional derivatives that are useful for the derivation of
the propagator equation.
In particular, we address the
eﬀects of a change in the ﬁeld basis for the propagator
equation.

For a given complex ﬁeld ϕa(η, ~k) in Fourier space the

quadratic eﬀective action takes the general form

The k-integral comprises for every ~k both contributions
from ϕ(~k) and ϕ(−~k), and we have to remember that these
ﬁelds are not independent, i.e. ϕa(η,−~k) = ϕ∗(η, ~k). As a
consequence, the second functional derivative reads

Γ(2)
ab (η, ~k; η′, ~k′) =

∂2Γ2

∂ϕ∗

a(η, ~k)∂ϕb(η′, ~k′)

= δ(k − k′)(cid:2)Aab(~k; η, η′) + Aba(−~k; η′, η)(cid:3). (E.2)
For Aab(−~k, η, η′) = Aab(~k, η, η′) only the symmetric part
of A contributes to Γ(2). This is realized in our case where
A only involves even powers of km through projectors on
the modes γmn, Wm, κ and σ, multiplied with operators
that depend on k2.

Furthermore, Aab turns out to be a purely imaginary

diﬀerential operator,

A(~k; η′, η) = iδ(η − η′)Dab(~k, η, ∂η).

(E.3)

Writing

Dab(~k, η, ∂η) = D(0)

ab (~k, η) + D(1)

ab (~k, η)∂η + D(2)

ab (~k, η)∂2

η + ...
(E.4)

one infers

Γ(2)
ab (η, ~k; η′, ~k′) = iδ(η − η′)δ(k − k′) ˜Dab(~k, η, η′),

(E.5)

with

(E.6)

This structure can be most easily visualized as a result of
b (−~k)ϕa(−~k).
partial integration of the terms involving ϕ∗
For example, one has the following associations

D = a2∂2

η + (∂η + 2H)2(cid:1),
D = 2Ha2∂η → ˜D = −a2(4H2 + 2∂ηH),
η + 2H∂η).

η → ˜D = a2(cid:0)∂2
η + 2H∂η) → ˜D = 2a2(∂2

(E.7)

D = a2(∂2

The propagator equation Γ(2)G = E can be solved in
an arbitrary ﬁeld basis. Consider unconstrained ﬁelds ϕa
where E = δb
a,

For a linear regular transformation

ϕa = Aabψb

this translates to

(E.8)

(E.9)

∂2Γ
∂ψa∂ψb hψbψcic = δa
c .

(E.10)

We will encounter ﬁeld transformations

ϕa(~k, η) = Bac(~k, η, ∂η)ψc(~k, η)

(E.11)

that are not necessarily regular. We still can ﬁrst evaluate
the correlation function in the ψ-basis and subsequently
use

G(ϕ)
ab (η, ~k; η′, ~k′) = hϕa(η, ~k)ϕ∗

This situation is realized if we want to compute the metric
correlation from the propagators of the physical ﬂuctua-
tions γmn, W, κ and σ. The latter are represented here by
ψ, while the relation between the metric components φ and
ψ is given by hµν = tµν + sµν and the expansion (286).
