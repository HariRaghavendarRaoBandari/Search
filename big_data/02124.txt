An eﬀective self-consistent model is derived and used to study the dynamics of an electron gas
conﬁned in a nonparabolic and anisotropic quantum well. This approach is based on the equations
of quantum hydrodynamics, which incorporate quantum and nonlinear eﬀects in an approximate
fashion. The eﬀective model consists of a set of six coupled diﬀerential equations (dynamical system)
for the electric dipole and the size of the electron gas. Using this model we show that: (i) High
harmonic generation is related to the appearance of chaos in the phase space, as attested by related
Poincar´e sections; (ii) Higher order harmonics can be excited eﬃciently and with relatively weak
driving ﬁelds by making use of chirped electromagnetic waves.

INTRODUCTION

Current technology allows the manipulation and control of the electron dynamics in small devices of nanometric size,
such as semiconductor quantum dots and quantum wells. These devices have attracted considerable attention in the
last few decades, particularly in view of their potential use for quantum computing1.
When the conﬁning potential well is perfectly parabolic, the electron response is dominated by the Kohn mode2,3,
i.e., a rigid oscillation of the electron density at the characteristic frequency of the parabolic well. For nonparabolic
conﬁnement the situation is much more complex. When the excitation is small (linear response), the Kohn mode
may still be dominating. However, for larger excitation energies, the electrons may explore the anharmonic regions
of the conﬁning potential; in that case, the frequency spectrum of such nonlinear response becomes much more
intricate, with the appearance of second- and higher-order harmonics. In addition to the eﬀect of the anharmonicity
of the conﬁnement, the interparticle Coulomb interactions also contribute to the complexity of the spectral response.
At a mathematical level, this complexity arises because the center-of-mass and internal degrees of freedom can no
longer be separated, as was shown in several studies that use powerful exact methods to model the quantum electron
dynamics4,5.

However, exact approaches are necessarily limited to a very small number of particles. Although such few- or even
single-electron systems can nowadays be realized in the laboratory, in most practical situations a great many electrons
are involved6,7. In that case self-consistent eﬀects – arising from the Coulomb interactions between all the electrons
– play a crucial role on the dynamics. Several theoretical and computational studies, which treat the many-body
dynamics in an approximate way, have investigated the linear and nonlinear electron response. The methods of
choice are the Hartree-Fock equations8, density functional theory (DFT)9, or phase-space methods based on Wigner
functions10.

Even the above-cited methods can be computationally too costly for very large systems. A possible alternative relies
on quantum hydrodynamics (QHD)11,12, an approach that was successfully used in the past to model the electron
dynamics in molecular systems13, metallic nanoparticles14–17 and thin ﬁlms18, and semiconductor quantum wells19.
In Ref.18 the validity of the QHD method was studied and compared to DFT results. More recently, we used a QHD
approach to investigate high-harmonic generation in metallic nanoparticles excited with ultrafast laser pulses20.
The QHD model can be further simpliﬁed by means of a variational approach16 that expresses the QHD equations in
terms of a Lagrangian density. With this method, it is possible to obtain a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations for
a set of macroscopic quantities, such as the center of mass and the size of the electron gas. Although simple, the ﬁnal
equations still capture some of the most prominent features of the electron dynamics, namely: (i) the self-consistent
Coulomb interaction, (ii) quantum eﬀects to lowest order, (iii) exchange and correlation eﬀects in a DFT fashion, and
(iv) the geometry of the conﬁning well.

Here, we will use this approach to study the collective dynamics of an electron gas conﬁned in a semiconductor

quantum well. The simplicity of the model allows one to carry out a large number of simulations, so that the electron
dynamics can be fully characterized. Our main focus will be on the eﬀect of the anharmonicity and the anisotropy
of the potential well on the electron response. We will see that, when increasing the anharmonic component of
the conﬁning potential, the electron dynamics becomes more and more complex and eventually fully chaotic. The
anisotropy of the conﬁnement and the magnitude of the Coulomb eﬀects (i.e., the number of trapped electrons) also
play an important role in this transition. We will ﬁnally show that the appearance of chaotic behavior is accompanied
by the presence of higher-order harmonics in the electron response.

II. QHD MODEL

The set of QHD equations for the electron density n(r, t), the electron mean velocity u(r, t), and the Hartree potential
VH (r, t) reads as

where the ﬁrst equation above represents conservation of mass, the second represents conservation of momentum, and
the third is Poisson’s equation for the self-consistent Hartree potential VH . In Eq. (2), Vconf (r, t) is the potential of
the conﬁning well, VX is the exchange potential (see below), and P (r, t) is the Fermi pressure of a degenerated electron
gas (we will make the assumption that the system’s temperature is always much lower than the Fermi temperature)

P =

5(cid:0)3π2(cid:1)2/3

n5/3.

(4)

The last term in Eq. (2) is the so-called Bohm potential, which incorporates quantum eﬀects to the lowest order. The
Bohm potential is related to the so-called von Weizs¨acker term in Thomas-Fermi theory and orbital-free DFT21.

The above equations are written in “semiconductor” atomic units (au). These are formally identical to standard
au, but the electron mass me is replaced by the eﬀective mass m∗ = 0.067me and the vacuum dielectric constant
ǫ0 by its eﬀective counterpart ǫ∗ = 13ǫ0. In this system of units, length are normalized to an eﬀective Bohr radius
a∗ = 4πǫ∗2/(m∗e2) = 10.3 nm, energy to an eﬀective Hartree energy E∗H = 2/(m∗a∗2) = 10.8 meV, frequency to
ω∗ = E∗H / = 2π × 2.63 THz, and time to τ∗ = 1/ω∗ = 0.061 ps. These units will be used throughout this work

unless otherwise speciﬁed.

The conﬁning potential is given by the sum of a harmonic and an anharmonic (but isotropic) part, whose relative
strength is measured by the parameter ζ ≥ 0:

1

Vconf =

2(cid:0)kxx2 + kyy2 + kzz2(cid:1) + ζ(cid:0)x2 + y2 + z2(cid:1)2

.

(5)

We chose this speciﬁc form for the anharmonic part of the conﬁnement, so that it can be captured by the single
parameter ζ. The elastic constants ki of the harmonic potential in Eq.

As in DFT, exchange eﬀects can be modeled by a density-dependent eﬀective potential

The prefactor β is a free parameter that we set equal to β = 0.005, which is a best-ﬁt frequently used in atomic-
structure calculations16,22.
The QHD equations (1)-(3) can be represented, without further approximations, by a Lagrangian density L(n, θ, VH ),
where the function θ(r, t) is related to the mean velocity, u = ∇θ. The expression for the Lagrangian density is as

By taking the standard Euler-Lagrange equations with respect to the three ﬁelds n, θ, and VH , one recovers exactly
the QHD equations (1)-(3).

In order to derive a tractable system of equations, one needs to specify a particular Ansatz for the electron density.
Here, we take a Gaussian shape, which is a reasonable choice, as it is the exact ground-state solution when one neglects
Coulomb interactions and the anharmonic part of the conﬁnement. Thus we write:

where the prefactor A = N/ (2π)3/2 is obtained by ﬁxing the total number of particles N =R ndr, and ρ is a displaced

Here, di(t) and σi(t) are time-dependant variables that represent respectively the center of mass and the size of the
electron gas in each Cartesian direction.

We now need to express the other variables (θ and VH ) in terms of the electron density. The mean velocity u can be
obtained exactly from the continuity equation (1). Its Cartesian components are:

˙σi

ui =

σi(cid:0)ri − di(cid:1) + ˙di,
where i = {x, y, z} and ri = (x, y, z). From the above expression we obtain
(ri − di)2 + ˙di(ri − di)(cid:19) .
erf(cid:0)ρ/√2(cid:1)

where erf is the error function. This expression constitutes an approximate solution of Poisson’s equation (3), which
becomes exact in the radially symmetric case (σx = σy = σz).
Substituting the above expression for n, θ, and VH into the Lagrangian density (7) and integrating over the entire
space, we obtain the following Lagrangian function:

(17)

As expected, in the case of harmonic conﬁnement (ζ = 0) the dipole and breathing modes are completely decoupled
(Kohn’s theorem2,3).

We have thus reduced the complex problem of the dynamics of a multi-electron system to a relatively simple system of
six coupled diﬀerential equations for the center of mass and size of the electron gas, which can be solved on a desktop
computer using standard methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta). As noted in the introduction, this approximate system still
incorporates such important eﬀects as Coulomb interactions, quantum and exchange eﬀects, as well as the eﬀects of
the geometry of the conﬁning trap (anharmonicity and anisotropy). Also, no assumptions of linearity were made, so
that Eqs. (17) can be used to study the nonlinear response of the electron gas.

III. GROUND STATE AND LINEAR REGIME

Stationary states are obtained by setting ¨di = ¨σi = 0. For the dipole mode, the solutions are clearly di = 0. For the
breathing mode, the equations of motions are those of a ﬁctitious particle evolving in the external potential Uσ + Udσ.
The equilibrium solution σ(0)
corresponds to the minimum of such potential and can be found by setting its ﬁrst
derivative to zero:

In the most general case, it is not possible to obtain analytical solutions for the ground state and one has to resort
to numerical methods. However, an analytical solution can be found in the case of isotropic conﬁnement (kx = ky =
kz ≡ k) and in the limit of a large number of particles (N ≫ 1). We found that the size of the electron gas scales
as a power of the number of electrons N . The exponent varies according to whether the anharmonic part of the
potential is included or not: σ(0) = (cid:0) α1
for ζ 6= 0 (anharmonic).
As expected, for harmonic conﬁnement the volume increases as the total number of particles. For the anharmonic
case, the increase with N is slower, reﬂecting the fact that the anharmonic term tends to further conﬁne the electrons.
Note that in this case the exponent is always 1/5, irrespective of the value of ζ. These results were conﬁrmed by
numerical simulations of the isotropic case obtained without making the large-N approximation (Fig. 1).

numbers of particles. For an isotropic case (kx = ky = kz = 1) we obtain, as expected, a single value for the dipole
frequency that is three times degenerate, but two values for the breathing frequencies, one of which is twice degenerate.
These two breathing frequencies correspond to two distinguished modes. In the non-degenerate mode the volume V (t)
of the electron gas oscillates, whereas the aspect ratios σi/σj remain constant. This mode preserves the spherical
symmetry of the equilibrium state and can be excited by perturbing the three σi in the same way. In contrast, for the
twice-degenerate mode the volume stays constant whereas the ratios σi/σj oscillate at the corresponding frequency.
These modes are shown in Fig. 2.
In the ﬁgure, we show numerical simulations of the full system obtained by
perturbing the stationary ground state by a very small amount δi: σi(t = 0) = σ(0)
i + δi. In all cases, the dipole
mode is not excited, i.e., di(t = 0) = 0. In the top panel, we only excited the twice-degenerate mode by choosing the
perturbations δi such that the volume is invariant: as expected, the volume stays constant during the linear evolution,
while the various σi oscillate. In the bottom panel, we only excited the non-degenerate mode by taking δx = δy = δz:
here, the volume oscillates while the ratio σx(t)/σz(t) remain constant.
In the case of isotropic conﬁnement (kx = ky = kz ≡ k), analytical expressions for the dipole frequency Ωd and for the
degenerate (Ω(d)
) breathing frequencies can be found in the large N limit. For harmonic
conﬁnement (ζ = 0), one obtains the following expressions (which are actually exact for all values of N ):

Note that the presence of an anharmonic part in the conﬁning potential introduces a dependence on the number of
particles N in the frequencies.

In Fig. 3, we show the dependence of the dipole frequency with the geometry of the trap (characterized by the
parameter k⊥/kz, where k⊥ ≡ kx = ky) and the number of electrons. Note that when k⊥/kz ≪ 1 the trap is “pancake
shaped”, while in the opposite case k⊥/kz ≫ 1 it is “cigar shaped”; k⊥/kz = 1 denotes an isotropic trap.

For an isotropic conﬁnement (Fig. 3, middle panel) the analytical expressions (dotted lines) match closely the
numerical results for N ≫ 1. The anharmonicity introduces a dependence of the dipole frequency with the number
of electrons, with higher frequencies corresponding to larger N . The same trend is observed for a cigar-shaped trap
(left panel) and a pancake-shaped trap (right panel). In these anisotropic traps, the longitudinal (parallel to z) and
transverse (⊥) dipole frequencies of course do not coincide, but both still grow with N .

IV. NONLINEAR REGIME AND HARMONIC GENERATION

In the previous sections, we characterized the linear response of the electron dynamics by studying the eigenvalues
of the linearized system of equations. Physically, the linear response corresponds to a weak excitation of the system
and results in one or a few lines in the frequency spectrum. In order to trigger high harmonic generation (HHG), it
is often necessary to probe the nonlinear response regime, typically by increasing the excitation.

A. HHG and Poincar´e sections

In a ﬁrst set of simulations in the nonlinear regime, we show that HHG is accompanied by some typical signatures of
deterministic chaos in the dynamics. Here, we use Poincar´e sections as evidence of chaotic behavior. We also point
out that this type of study is feasible because our reduced mathematical model is a system of ordinary diﬀerential
equations, which can be analyzed with the usual methods of classical Hamiltonian mechanics.

8

The method of Poincar´e sections consists in choosing a two-dimensional cross-section (i.e., a plane) of the entire
phase space (which, in our case, is six-dimensional) and recording the position on such plane each time that the
representative point of the system crosses it. If the system is chaotic, then there is no correlations between the various
points on the Poincar´e section, and some ﬁnite 2D regions of the plane will be covered uniformly. In contrast, if the
system is regular, i.e. periodic, the representative point of the system will pass through the same point after some
time, and the Poincar´e section will consist of isolated points or 1D lines on the plane.

In our case, we choose the (dx, dy) plane for the Poincar´e section. Such plane divides the electron trap in two identical
regions. In the forthcoming simulations we take N = 50 electrons and an anisotropic trap characterized by k⊥ = 5 and
kz = 1. We perturb the stationary ground state by suddenly changing the position and velocity of the dipole variable,
˙dx = − ˙dy = δ, and ˙dz = 0, with the perturbation
i.e., by setting the following initial conditions at t = 0: di = δ,
amplitude δ varying between 0.01 and 3, and σi(t = 0) = σ(0)
. The corresponding Poincar´e sections are shown in Fig.
4. For δ = 0.01 the system is clearly regular, as the Poincar´e section is basically an ellipse (this is due to the choice of
the initial condition). By increasing δ, the central phase-space region starts ﬁlling up, ﬁrst partially and in a regular
way (Fig. 4b-c) and then completely for δ = 3 (Fig. 4d). The homogeneous coverage of a ﬁnite phase-space area is a
signature of chaotic behavior.

1 (c), and 3 (d). The simulations were performed for an anisotropic trap with k⊥ = 5, kz = 1, N = 50, and ζ = 0.01.

It is interesting to check how the onset of chaos with increasing perturbation correlates with the total power radiated
by the electron gas. At large distances, the electron gas can be viewed as an electric dipole of charge −N e and
displacement dz(t) oscillating along the z axis. In this case we can apply the Larmor formula23 for the total radiated
power: P (t) = e2/(6πǫ0c3)| ¨dz(t)|2. The dipole power spectrum P (ω) is shown in Fig. 5 for the same cases as in Fig.
4. As expected, the spectrum displays a single line at the dipole frequency when the excitation is weak (δ = 0.01).
Higher order harmonics start appearing at larger values of δ, and are at the origin of the multiperiodic motion observed
in the corresponding Poincar´e sections. Finally, for δ = 3 the spectrum is nearly continuous, in agreement with the
chaotic dynamics observed in Fig. 4.

The same transition to chaos accompanied by HHG was observed for a case where we keep the excitation constant
(δ = 1) and increase the anharmonicity parameter from ζ = 0 to ζ = 0.1 (Figs. 6-7).

To sum up, the situation can be described as follows. In order to observe some chaotic dynamics, the presence of an
anharmonic term in the conﬁnement is necessary – a purely harmonic oscillator is always integrable. A ﬁnite value of ζ
introduces some coupling between the dipole and the breathing motions, which enlarges the available phase space and
allows chaotic behavior. This chaotic behavior is displayed only when the system explores the nonparabolic regions
of the conﬁning trap. This can be achieved either by increasing the initial excitation (Figs. 4-5) or by increasing the
anharmonicity of the trap (Figs. 6-7). Finally, we note that a certain degree of anisotropy (k⊥ = 5kz in our case) was

B. HHG and resonant excitation

So far, we used a simple excitation for our nonlinear system, namely an initial velocity imparted on the dipole variables
˙di(t = 0). In reality, the electron dynamics is usually triggered by electromagnetic (laser) pulses. In order to simulate
this scenario, we assume that the conﬁned electron gas is excited via an oscillating electric ﬁeld directed along the z
axis, E = Ez(t)ez. It can be shown that the eﬀect of the ﬁeld can be included simply by adding a term −eEzdz to
the lagrangian L. We consider three cases here: (i) an excitation at a nonresonant frequency, (ii) an excitation at a
resonant frequency, and (iii) an excitation with chirp (autoresonance). Note that the dipole linear resonant frequency
is in the Tera-Hertz domain.

The results are shown in Fig. 8. For the ﬁrst two cases, the excitation has the form Ez(t) = E0 cos(ω0t), where
E0 is the electric ﬁeld amplitude of the electromagnetic wave. In all cases shown here, we took the same amplitude
E0 = 0.01 au, corresponding to E0 = 1.05 × 104 V/m in SI units, which can be easily reached experimentally. In
the ﬁrst case (green curves on the ﬁgure), ω0 = 0.8Ωdz diﬀers from the linear response frequency Ωdz . Being out of
resonance, the system stays close to the linear regime: the oscillation amplitude remains small (Fig. 8a) and only a
small amount of energy is absorbed by the electron gas (Fig. 8b) The power spectrum (Fig. 8c) displays four (small)
peaks, corresponding to the laser frequency, the linear response frequency, and the harmonics Ωdz ± ω0.
For a resonant excitation ω0 = Ωdz (black curves), the oscillation amplitude and the absorbed energy initially increase,
but then decrease again after some time. This is because the eﬀective force acting on the dipole is not harmonic and the
resonant frequency actually depends on the amplitude of the oscillations. When the amplitude grows and the system
reaches the nonlinear regime, the ﬁxed external frequency no longer matches the instantaneous resonant frequency
(which diﬀers from Ωdz in the nonlinear regime). The resulting power spectrum displays two lines corresponding to
the linear frequency and the ﬁrst harmonic.

Finally, we use an oscillating ﬁeld with a chirped frequency: Ez(t) = E0 cos(cid:0)ω0t + α
variation of the laser frequency. This type of forcing is known as autoresonance24 and was applied in the past to
many physical systems25,26. Autoresonance occurs when a classical nonlinear oscillator is externally excited by an
oscillating ﬁeld with slowly varying frequency. For |α| ≪ ω2
0 (adiabatic process) and E0 above a certain threshold, the
instantaneous oscillator frequency becomes “locked” to the instantaneous excitation frequency, so that the resonance
condition is always satisﬁed. In that case, the amplitude of the oscillations grows indeﬁnitely and without saturation,
until of course some other eﬀect becomes dominant. Usually the threshold behaves as Eth
0 ∼ |α|3/4, so that the
amplitude can be arbitrarily small provided that the external frequency varies slowly enough24.

FIG. 8: Color online. Laser excitation of the dipole response, for a trap with parameters: k⊥ = 5, kz = 1, N = 50, ζ = 0.01.
The amplitude of the excitation is E0 = 1.05 × 104 V/m. We show the dipole amplitude dz(t) (a), the absorbed energy (b), and
the power spectrum P (ω) (c), for three cases: nonresonant excitation at constant frequency (green curves), resonant excitation
at constant frequency (black), and chirped excitation (red).

In an earlier study, using the autoresonant technique in conjunction with a phase-space model of the electron dynamics,
we showed that it is possible to eﬃciently extract the electrons from a Gaussian-shaped quantum well10. More recently,
autoresonant excitation was used to trigger HHG in metallic nanoparticles20. We now show that it can be very eﬀective
also for the systems considered here, namely quantum dots and quantum wells.

In order for autoresonance to work, the excitation frequency, which varies linearly in time as ω(t) = ω0 +αt, must cross
at some point the resonant dipole frequency Ωdz = 20.07 THz. Therefore, for this simulation we chose ω0 = 18.45 THz
and a chirp rate α = 3.03 THz/ns. The resonant frequency is crossed around t ≈ 0.55 ns, after which the autoresonant
process starts being eﬀective, as can be seen in Fig. 8. It is clear from Fig. 8 that the autoresonant excitation allows
one to increase phenomenally the amplitude of the dipole oscillations and consequently the absorbed energy, which
is roughly three times as large compared to the non chirped case. We stress that the excitation amplitude is the
same for all cases. The power spectrum (Fig. 8c) displays several peaks for higher order harmonics (up to the third
harmonic), with the ﬁrst harmonic being roughly a factor of ten smaller that the linear mode. We also note that these
spectral lines are unusually broad. This is probably due to the chirped excitation, which sweeps several frequencies
around each harmonic.
The important point is that, using a rather weak excitation (E0 = 1.05 × 104 V/m in the present case, which could
be made even weaker by reducing the chirp rate α), one can induce signiﬁcant energy absorption by the electron gas,
accompanied by HHG at remarkably high levels.

V. CONCLUSIONS

HHG is a highly topical research area with many potential applications27; most notably it is a prerequisite for the
generation of attosecond laser pulses28. In this work, our aim was to explore the possibility of HHG using nanometric

12

system containing many electrons, such as semiconductor quantum dots and wells. With this purpose in mind, we
constructed an eﬀective model in the form of a dynamical system made of six coupled diﬀerential equations for the
center of mass and the size of the electron gas. This eﬀective model results from the application of a variational
method to the equations of quantum hydrodynamics.

The model was later applied to the dynamics of an electron gas in a nonparabolic and anisotropic well. Two main
results were obtained. First, we showed that harmonic generation is accompanied by dynamical chaos in the equations
of motion. The onset of chaos was quantiﬁed by the appearance of ergodic regions in some Poincar´e sections.

Second, we demonstrated that HHG can be eﬃciently achieved by exciting the system with a chirped laser pulse.
This process, known as classical autoresonance, is capable of bringing the electrons into a strongly nonlinear regime,
leading to the generation of high harmonics. Crucially, the autoresonance technique works well for relatively modest
driving ﬁelds and does not require any ﬁne tuning of the laser pulse.

The present results complete and extend to three spatial dimensions our earlier ﬁndings that HHG can be triggered
with similar techniques in systems of metallic nanoparticles20.
