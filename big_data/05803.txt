Heavy hyperplanes in multiarrangements and

their freeness

Takuro Abe∗and Lukas K¨uhne†

March 21, 2016

Abstract

Only few categories of free arrangements are known in which Terao’s
conjecture holds. One of such categories consists of 3-arrangements with
unbalanced Ziegler restrictions. In this paper, we generalize this result to
arbitrary dimensional arrangements in terms of ﬂags by introducing unbal-
anced multiarrangements. For that purpose, we generalize several freeness
criterions for simple arrangements, including Yoshinaga’s freeness criterion,
to unbalanced multiarrangements.

Introduction

In the theory of hyperplane arrangements, the freeness of an arrangement is one of
the most important objects to study. Terao’s conjecture asserting the dependence
of the freeness only on the combinatorics is the longstanding open problem in this
area. The recent approach to this problem, which gives a partial answer, is based
on multiarrangements due to Yoshinaga’s criterion in [18], [19], [8] and [1].

One of the most appealing results in this approach is the combinatorial de-
pendence of the freeness of a 3-arrangement with an unbalanced Ziegler restric-
tion. Namely, let A be a 3-arrangement and (AH, mH ) the Ziegler restriction
of A onto H ∈ A, which is deﬁned by AH := {H ∩ H ′ | H ′ ∈ A \ {H}} and
mH (X) := |AX \ {H}| for X ∈ AH. We say that (AH, mH) is unbalanced if there
is an X ∈ AH such that 2mH(X) ≥ |mH|. For an unbalanced 2-multiarrangement
(AH, mH), the exponents are of the form (mH(X), |mH| − mH (X)), which is de-
termined by the combinatorics of (AH, mH ) (and also A). We say that A has an

unbalanced Ziegler restriction if the Ziegler restriction of A onto one of H ∈ A is
unbalanced. In conclusion, the freeness of such A depends only on L(A), i.e., such
an A is free if and only if χ0(A; 0) = mH (X)(|mH| − mH(X)) by [18].

Hence it is a natural and interesting progression to question whether we can
generalize this formulation to arrangements in an arbitrary dimensional vector
space. It was unclear in the beginning as to how we should deﬁne an unbalanced
multiarrangment in the vector space whose dimension is at least three. The ﬁrst
aim of this paper is to provide the deﬁnition of “unbalanced” multiarrangements
in an arbitrary dimensional vector space. This deﬁnition is analogue to the one
for 2-multiarrangements.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement in V = Kℓ.

(1) We say that a hyperplane H0 ∈ A is the heavy hyperplane with m0 :=
m(H0) if 2m0 ≥ |m|. A multiarrangement (A, m) is called unbalanced if it
has the heavy hyperplane H0 ∈ A.

(2) We say that (A, m) has a locally heavy hyperplane H0 ∈ A with m0 :=
m(H0) if 2m0 ≥ |mX| for all the localization (AX, mX) with X ∈ AH0 satis-
fying |AX| ≥ 3.

(3) Let H0 be a locally heavy hyperplane in (A, m). The Euler-Ziegler restric-
tion (AH0, mH0) of (A, m) onto H0 ∈ A is deﬁned by, AH0 := {H0 ∩ H |

(4) Let (A, m) be an arbitrary multiarrangement and H0 ∈ A. The multi-
Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0) of (A, m) onto H0 ∈ A is deﬁned by,

H ∈ A \ {H0}, and mH0(X) :=PH∈AX \{H0} m(H).
AH0 := {H0 ∩ H | H ∈ A \ {H0}}, and mH0(X) :=PH∈AX \{H0} m(H).

Note that clearly the heavy hyperplane is also a locally heavy one. Deﬁnition
1.1 (3) is a very simple generalization of the classical Ziegler restriction introduced
in [20].
In general, this deﬁnition does not work as well as it does for simple
arrangements. However, if we focus on a locally heavy hyperplane, then this simply
generalized Ziegler multiplicity coincides with the Euler multiplicity deﬁned in [4].
Hence this restriction can be useful, as the following main result shows:

Theorem 1.2.

(1) Let (A, m) be unbalanced with the heavy hyperplane H0 ∈ A

with m0 := m(H0). Then

b2(A, m) − m0(|m| − m0) ≥ b2(AH0, mH0).

Moreover, (A, m) is free if and only if the Euler-Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0)
of (A, m) onto H0 is free, and b2(A, m) − m0(|m| − m0) = b2(AH0, mH0). In
this case, exp(A, m) = (m0, d2, . . . , dℓ), where exp(AH0, mH0) = (d2, . . . , dℓ).

2

(2) Let (A, m) have a locally heavy hyperplane H0 ∈ A with m0 := m(H0).
Then (A, m) is free if the Euler-Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0) of (A, m)
onto H0 is free, and b2(A, m) − m0(|m| − m0) = b2(AH0, mH0). In this case,
exp(A, m) = (m0, d2, . . . , dℓ), where exp(AH0, mH0) = (d2, . . . , dℓ).

Theorem 1.2 enables us to determine the freeness of an arbitrary unbalanced
multiarrangement. The determination of the freeness of a given multiarrangement
is far more diﬃcult than that of a simple arrangement. There are only two ways
to validate it: Ziegler’s free restriction theorem in [20], or the addition-deletion
theorem in [5]. To apply the former, we need to ﬁnd a free simple arrangement
whose Ziegler restriction is the given one. To apply the latter, we need a free
multiarrangement close to the given one and then increase/decrease multiplicities
by applying the addition-deletion theorem in [5]. Theorem 1.2 enables us to check
the freeness only by using the information of the given one under the heaviness
assumption. Let us see how to apply it in the following example:

Example 1.3. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement deﬁned by

x5y2z16(x − y)3(y − z)2(x − z)4 = 0.

This has the heavy hyperplane H := {z = 0} by deﬁnition. We can easily compute
both sides in Theorem 1.2 (1) as

b2(A, m) − m(H)(|m| − m(H)) = 63 = b2(AH, mH).

Note that the Euler-Ziegler restriction of (A, m) onto H is free with exponents
(7, 9), see [17] for example. Hence (A, m) is free with exponents (7, 9, 16) by The-
orem 1.2 (1). In fact, the multiarrangement (A, m + kδH ) is free when −7 ≤ k by
Theorem 1.2 (2).

Let (B, m) be a multiarrangement deﬁned by

x2y2z14(x − y)3(y − z)3(x − z)4 = 0.

This has the heavy hyperplane H := {z = 0} by deﬁnition. We can easily compute
both sides in Theorem 1.2 (1) as

b2(B, m) − m(H)(|m| − m(H)) = 51 > 49 = b2(BH, mH).

Hence (B, m) is not free.

In particular, as an easy corollary, we have the following.

Corollary 1.4. Let A be the Weyl arrangement of the type A3. Assume that
(A, m) is unbalanced. Then the freeness of A depends only on L(A, m), where
L(A, m) consists of L(A) with the information m(H) for each H ∈ L1(A).

3

Deﬁnition 1.1 (4) is the simplest whose meaning has not yet been investigated.
This restriction also plays an interesting role for general multiarrangements as
shown in the next deﬁnition and theorem.

Deﬁnition 1.5. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangment and ﬁx H ∈ A. Then deﬁne

bH
2 (A, m) : = b2(A, m) − m(H)(|m| − m(H)),
BH

b2(AX, mX).

2 (A, m) : = XX∈L2(A)\AH

Theorem 1.6. Let (A, m) be an ℓ-multiarrangement and H ∈ A. Then

2 (A, m) ≥ BH
bH

2 (A, m) ≥ b2(AH, mH) ≥ b2(AH, m∗),

where m∗ is the Euler multiplicity of (A, m) onto H and (AH, mH) the multi-
Ziegler restriction of ((A, m)) onto H.

We will show the above results by using a special derivation, which plays a
similar role as the Euler derivation for unbalanced multiarrangements. In other
words, we can apply several arguments valid for simple arrangements in [8], [18],
[19], [20] and so on to unbalanced multiarrangements with slight modiﬁcations. In
this paper we include all the proofs based on them for the completeness.

With Theorem 1.2 we can prove the following theorem.

Theorem 1.7. Let A be an arrangement in V = Kℓ and let {Xi}ℓ
i=0 be a ﬂag of
A such that Xi+1 ∈ AXi is heavy in (AXi, mXi) for i = 0, . . . , ℓ − 1. Then A is
free with exp(A) = (mX0(X1), mX1(X2), . . . , mXℓ−1(Xℓ)) if and only if

(1.1)

b2(A) = X0≤i<j≤ℓ−1

mXi(Xi+1)mXj (Xj+1)

Let us call the ﬂag in Theorem 1.7 a heavy ﬂag. Then Theorem 1.7 immedi-
ately implies the following corollary which shows Terao’s conjecture in the class of
arrangements that admit a heavy ﬂag:

Corollary 1.8. Let HFℓ be the set of hyperplane arrangements in V = Kℓ such
that every A ∈ HFℓ has a heavy ﬂag. Then the freeness of A ∈ HF depends only
on combinatorics. In this case, this ﬂag gives both a supersolvable ﬁlatration and
a divisional ﬂag as in [1].

Note that Terao showed in [15] for a 3-arrangement A with a heavy ﬂag
that (1.1) is equivalent to A being supersolvable. Together with [18] this im-
plies Corollary 1.8 for the case ℓ = 3. Corollary 1.8 generalizes it to the case of
arbitrary dimension.

4

Example 1.9. Let A in V = K4 be deﬁned by

4

xy(x − y)(y − z)(x − z)(x + y + z)w(y − w)(y + w)

(z − kw) = 0,

Yk=−3

Then, A has the heavy ﬂag H := {w = 0} ∈ A, L := {w = z = 0} ∈ (AH, mH) and
K := {w = z = y = 0} ∈ (AL, mL), with mV (H) = 1, mH (L) = 8, mL(K) = 4
and mK(0) = 4. So the RHS of (1.1) evaluates to 1(8+4+4)+8(4+4)+4·4 = 96.
We can compute b2(A) = 99. Therefore, Theorem 1.7 implies that A is non-free.

Remark 1.10. Without the assumption on the heaviness, we can show the follow-
ing:

for an arbitrary ﬂag {Xi}ℓ

i=0 of A.

b2(A) ≥ X0≤i<j≤ℓ−1

mXi(Xi+1)mXj (Xj+1).

The equality holds if and only if A is supersolvable (hence free) with exponents
(mX0(X1), mX1(X2), . . . , mXℓ−1(Xℓ)).

For the proof, see [2], Proposition 4.2 for example. However, in this case, A can
be free even when the equality does not hold. For example, the Weyl arrangement
of the type Dℓ (ℓ ≥ 4) is free, but not supersolvable. Hence this gives an example
of free arrangements which do not satisfy the b2-equality above.

The organization of this article is as follows. In §2 we introduce several results
used for the proof of results in §1. In §3 we prove Theorem 1.2. In §4 and §5, we
give several applications of our main result related to the freeness of simple ar-
rangements and multiarrangements, and the combinatorial dependence of freeness.
Lemma 3.2, Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 3.6 are the main results of the second
author’s bachelor degree thesis [10], completed at the University of Kaiserslautern
under the supervision of Mathias Schulze. Their proofs are provided in this paper
for the completeness.

2 Preliminaries

In this section we ﬁx some notations and introduce some known results, which will
be used later.

Let V be a vector space of dimension ℓ over a ﬁeld K and S = S(V ∗) be
the symmetric algebra. We can choose coordinates x1, . . . , xℓ for V ∗ such that
S = K[x1, . . . , xℓ]. A hyperplane H in V is a linear subspace of codimension 1. A
(central) arrangement of hyperplanes A is a ﬁnite collection of hyperplanes.
This article is mainly concerned with multiarrangements, which are deﬁned to
be an arrangement of hyperplanes A with a multiplicity function m : A → Z>0.
Multiarrangements were ﬁrst deﬁned by Ziegler in [20] and are denoted by (A, m).

H ∈ A is sometimes called a simple hyperplane arrangement. For each hyperplane

H

Deﬁne |m| = PH∈A m(H). A multiarrangement (A, m) with m(H) = 1 for all
H we can choose a linear deﬁning equation αH ∈ S. Then Q(A, m) =QH∈A αm(H)

is the deﬁning polynomial of a multiarrangement (A, m). For L ∈ A we deﬁne
the characteristic multiplicity of L to be δL(H) = 1 only if H = L and 0
otherwise.

For an arrangement A the set of all non-empty intersections of elements of A

is deﬁned to be the intersection lattice L(A), i.e.,

L(A) := {∩H∈BH | B ⊂ A}.

It is ordered by reverse inclusion and ranked by the codimension. Denote by
Lr(A) = {X ∈ L(A) | codim(X) = r} the set of X ∈ L(A) of codimension r. For
any X ⊂ V let AX = {H ∈ A | X ⊆ H} and mX = m|AX be the localization of
a multiarrangement (A, m) at X.

For p ≥ 1, the S-module Derp(S) is the set of all alternating p-linear forms
θ : Sp → S such that θ is a K-derivation in each variable. For p = 0 one deﬁnes
Der0(S) := S and one also writes Der(S) := Der1(S). Since Der(S) is a free S-
module, it holds that Derp(S) = ∧p Der(S). A derivation θ ∈ Derp(S) is called
homogeneous of polynomial degree p if θ(f1, ..., fp) is zero or a polynomial of degree
p for all f1, ..., fp ∈ V ∗. It is denoted by pdeg θ = p. The logarithmic derivation
modules of (A, m) are deﬁned as

Dp(A, m) := {θ ∈ Derp(S) | θ(αH , f2, ..., fp) ∈ αm(H)

H

S for all H ∈ A and f2, ..., fp ∈ S},

and D(A, m) := D1(A, m). If D(A, m) is a free S-module, we call (A, m) a free
multiarrangement. The fact that the S-module D(A, m) is reﬂexive implies the
following proposition.

Proposition 2.1. [20, Theorem 5] A multiarrangement (A, m) is free whenever

r(A) := codimV (TH∈A H) ≤ 2.

If (A, m) is free, one can choose a homogenous basis θ1, . . . , θℓ of D(A, m)
and deﬁne exp(A, m) = (pdeg θ1, . . . , pdeg θℓ) to be the exponents of (A, m).
For θ1, ..., θℓ ∈ D(A, m) an (ℓ × ℓ)-matrix M(θ1, ..., θℓ) can be deﬁned by setting

6

the (i, j)-th entry to be θj(xi). The determinant of this matrix gives a useful
criterion to decide the freeness of a multiarrangement via the following theorem,
ﬁrst proved by K. Saito for simple arrangements [12, Theorem 1.8] and by Ziegler
for multiarrangements [20, Theorem 8].

Theorem 2.2. (Saito’s criterion) Let θ1, ..., θℓ be derivations in D(A, m).
Then there exists some f ∈ S such that

det M(θ1, ..., θℓ) = f Q(A, m).

Furthermore, {θ1, ..., θℓ} forms a basis of D(A, m) if and only if f ∈ K∗. In par-
ticular, if θ1, ..., θℓ are all homogeneous, then {θ1, ..., θℓ} forms a basis of D(A, m)
if and only if the following two conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) θ1, ..., θℓ are independent over S.

i=1 pdeg θi = |m|.

(ii) Pℓ

One of the most important invariants of a (multi-) arrangement is its charac-
teristic polynomial. It was ﬁrst deﬁned for simple arrangements combinatorially.
We only use the following algebraic characterization, which is shown in [13] for
simple arrangements and in [4] for multiarrangements. For a multiarrangement
(A, m), we deﬁne a function in x and t.

ψ(A, m; x, t) :=

ℓ

Xp=0

H(Dp(A, m), x)(t(x − 1) − 1)p,

where H(Dp(A, m), x) is the Hilbert series of the graded S-module Dp(A, m).
Although ψ((A, m); x, t) is a priori a rational function with poles along x = 1, it is
shown in [4, Theorem 2.5] (see also [13]) that in fact ψ(A, m; x, t) is a polynomial
in x and t, and we can deﬁne the following.

Deﬁnition 2.3. [4, Deﬁnition 2,1] A characteristic polynomial of a multiar-
rangement (A, m) is deﬁned as

χ(A, m; t) = lim
x→1

(−1)ℓψ(A, m; x, t).

Deﬁne the Betti numbers bi(A, m) ∈ Z≥0 of (A, m) by

χ(A, m; t) = tℓ − b1(A, m)tℓ−1 + b2(A, m)tℓ−2 − · · · + (−1)ℓbℓ(A, m).

Also in [4], the following local-global formula is shown:

7

Proposition 2.4. [4, Theorem 3.3] Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement. Then

bk(A, m) = XX∈Lk(A)

bk(AX, mX ).

Let X ∈ L2(A). Since (AX, mX) is an arrangement of rank two, it is free. We
denote its exponents by (e1(X), e2(X), 0, . . . , 0). With the local-global formula,
we can express b1(A, m) and b2(A, m) as follows:

(2.1)

(2.2)

b1(A, m) =|m|

b2(A, m) = XX∈L2(A)

e1(X)e2(X)

If (A, m) is free with exponents (d1, . . . , dℓ), Terao’s factorization theorem for

multiarrangements [4, Theorem 4.1] implies

ℓ

(2.3)

χ(A, m; t) =

(t − di).

Yi=0

Next, we review the addition-deletion theorem for multiarrangements. Let
(A, m) be a multiarrangement and H0 ∈ A a ﬁxed hyperplane. The deletion
(A′, m′) of (A, m) with respect to H0 is deﬁned as follows:

(1) If m(H0) = 1, then A′ := A \ {H0} and m′(H) = m(H) for all H ∈ A′.

(2) If m(H0) ≥ 2, then A′ := A and for H ∈ A′ = A, we set

m′(H) =(cid:26) m(H)

if H 6= H0,
m(H) − 1 if H = H0.

The restricted arrangement is deﬁned by AH0 = {H0 ∩ H | H ∈ A \ {H0}}.
Now for X ∈ AH0, (AX, mX ) is a rank 2 arrangement and we can choose a basis
{ζ1, . . . , ζℓ−2, θX , ψX} of D(AX, mX) such that pdeg ζi = 0, θX 6∈ αH0 DerK(S) and
θX ∈ αH0 DerK(S) as shown in [5]. Then the Euler multiplicity m∗ on AH0 is
deﬁned as m∗(X) := pdeg θX and (AH0, m∗) is called the Euler restriction of
(A, m). If H0 is a locally heavy hyperplane in (A, m), we can determine m∗ by [5,
Proposition 4.1] as

(2.4)

m∗(X) = |mX| − m(H0)

for any X ∈ AH0. Hence in the locally heavy case, the Euler restriction (AH0, m∗)
coincides with the Euler-Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0) (this is the reason why we
call our new restriction the Euler-Ziegler restriction). For the Euler-restriction one
can prove the following theorem.

8

Theorem 2.5. [5](Addition-Deletion Theorem for multiarrangements)
Let (A, m) be a multiarrangment and H0 ∈ A. Then any two of the following three
statements imply the third:

(1) (A, m) is free with exp(A, m) = (d1, ..., dℓ−1, dℓ).

(2) (A′, m′) is free with exp(A′, m′) = (d1, ..., dℓ−1, dℓ − 1).

(3) (AH0, m∗) is free with exp(AH0, m∗) = (d1, ..., dℓ−1).

Proposition 2.6. [4, Proposition 1.6] Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement and X ∈
L(A). If (A, m) is free, then so is (AX, mX).

Next we introduce supersolvable arrangements, which are deﬁned as follows.

Deﬁnition 2.7. An arrangement A is supersolvable if there exists a ﬁltration

A = Ar ⊃ Ar−1 ⊃ . . . ⊃ A2 ⊃ A1

such that

(1) rank(Ai) = i for i = 1, . . . , r.

(2) For any H, H ′ ∈ Ai \ Ai−1 with H 6= H ′, there exists some H ′′ ∈ Ai−1 such

that H ∩ H ′ ⊂ H ′′ .

With Theorem 2.5 the following theorem is shown in [5].

Theorem 2.8. [5, Theorem 5.10] Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement such that A
is supersolvable with a ﬁltration A = Ar ⊃ Ar−1 ⊃ . . . ⊃ A2 ⊃ A1 and r ≥ 2. Let
mi denote the multiplicity m |Ai and exp(A2, m2) = (d1, d2, 0, . . . , 0). Assume that
for each H ′ ∈ Ad \ Ad−1, H ′′ ∈ Ad−1 for d = 3, . . . , r and X := H ′ ∩ H ′′, it holds
that

AX = {H ′, H ′′},

or that

m(H ′′) ≥

 XH∈(Ad)X \(Ad−1)X

m(H)

 − 1.

Then (A, m) is free with exp(A, m) = (d1, d2, |m3|−|m2|, . . . , |mr|−|mr−1|, 0, . . . , 0).

The following theorems are fundamental in the study of freeness of simple
arrangements. In the rest of this paper, we generalize these results to the setup of
unbalanced multiarrangements.

9

Theorem 2.9. [20, Theorem 11] For a free arrangement A with exp(A) = (1, d2, . . . , dℓ),
the Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0) is free for any hyperplane H0 ∈ A and exp(AH0, mH0) =
(d2, . . . , dℓ).

Theorem 2.10. [8, Theorem 5.1] Let A be an arrangment with a ﬁxed hyperplane
H0 ∈ A and assume that ℓ ≥ 3. Let (AH0, mH0) be the Ziegler restriction onto H0.
Then it holds that

Moreover, A is free if and only if the above inequality is an equality, and (AH0, mH0)
is free.

b2(A) − (|A| − 1) ≥ b2(cid:0)AH0, mH0(cid:1) .

3 Proof of Theorem 1.2

The Ziegler restrictions of free simple arrangements are also free by Theorem 2.9.
However, the multi-Ziegler restriction of a free multiarrangement is not necessarily
free in general (e.g. see [10, Example 5.7]). In the following, our ﬁrst goal is to
generalize Theorem 2.9 to free unbalanced multiarrangements.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Fix a hyperplane H0 ∈ (A, m) with H0 = ker αH0. Deﬁne the
submodules Dp

0(A, m) of Dp(A, m) by

Dp

0(A, m) := {δ ∈ Dp(A, m) | δ(αH0, f2, . . . , fp) = 0 for any fi ∈ S}.

The next Lemma was already shown in [20, Theorem 11] for the Ziegler restric-
tion of a simple arrangement and p = 1. The proof transfers directly. We give it
here for the completeness.

Lemma 3.2. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement and ﬁx a hyperplane H0 ∈ A with
H0 = ker αH0. If δ ∈ Dp
0(A, m), then δ |H0∈ Dp(AH0, mH0). In particular, this
gives well-deﬁned restriction maps resp

0(A, m) → Dp(AH0, mH0).

H0 : Dp

Proof. We may assume αH0 = x1 by choosing suitable coordinates. Let X ∈ AH0
and set

AX = {H0, H1, ..., Hk}.

Hence H0 ∩ Hi = X for all i = 1, ..., k. We may assume that the deﬁning linear
forms αi for Hi are of the form

αi(x1, ..., xℓ) = cix1 + α′(x2, ..., xℓ)

0 a linear form and suitable ci ∈ K which are pairwise
for i = 1, ..., k, α′ ∈ H ∗
distinct. In this situation, we have kerH0 α′ = X, i.e., α′ is the deﬁning equation

10

of X in H0. Let δ ∈ Dp
module, it holds for i = 1, ..., k,

0(A, m) and f2, . . . , fp ∈ V ∗. By deﬁnition of the derivation

δ(cix1 + α′(x2, ..., xℓ), f2, . . . , fp) ∈ (cix1 + α′(x2, ..., xℓ))m(Hi)S.

Since δ(x1, f2, . . . , fp) = 0 due to the deﬁnition of Dp
is a divisor of δ(α′(x2, ..., xℓ), f2, . . . , fp) for all i = 1, ..., k. This fact yields

0(A, m), (cix1+α′(x2, ..., xℓ))m(Hi)

δ(α′(x2, ..., xℓ), f2, . . . , fp) ∈

k

(cix1 + α′(x2, ..., xℓ))m(Hi)S.

Yi=1

Now, the restricting onto H0 gives us

δ |H0 (α′, f2, . . . , fp) ∈ (α′)Pk

i=1 m(Hi)S = (α′)mH0 (X)S,

where S := S/Sx1 and fi is the image of fi ∈ S under the canonical surjection S →
S. Since f2, . . . , fp are chosen arbitrarily, it holds that δ|H0 ∈ Dp(AH0, mH0).

Next we introduce a particular type of derivation and show its existence for
two special classes of multiarrangements. This derivation will play the role of the
Euler derivation of a simple arrangement.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement with H0 ∈ A. A derivation θ0 ∈
D(A, m) is called a good summand to H0, if pdeg θ0 = m(H0) and θ0(αH0) =

. In this case, we also say (A, m) has a good summand to H0.

Let θ0 be a good summand to H0 of a multiarrangement (A, m) with H0 ∈ A.

Then we can decompose a general θ ∈ D(A, m) into

θ0 ∈ D0(A, m), we obtain a decomposition

D(A, m) = Sθ0 ⊕ D0(A, m).

The next theorem shows that an unbalanced free multiarrangement has such a
good summand.

Theorem 3.4. Suppose (A, m) is a free multiarrangement with exp(A, m) =
(d1, . . . , dℓ) such that H0 ∈ A is the heavy hyperplane with multiplicity m0 =
m(H0). Then it holds that

11

(1) (A, m) has a good summand to H0, and m0 ∈ exp(A, m). Let exp(A, m) =

(m0, d2, . . . , dℓ).

(2) The Euler-Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0) of A onto H0 is a free multiar-

rangement with exponents exp(AH0, mH0) = (d2, ..., dℓ).

Proof. We may choose coordinates such that H0 = {x1 = 0}. Let θ1, ..., θℓ be a
homogeneous basis of D(A, m). By deﬁnition of D(A, m) it holds for i = 1, ..., ℓ

(3.1)

θi(x1) ∈ xm0

Assume pdeg θi < m0 for all i = 1, ..., ℓ. Thus (3.1) implies θi(x1) = 0 for all

However, with Theorem 2.2 we may assume

(3.3)

det M(θ1, ..., θℓ) = Q(A, m).

In particular, det M(θ1, ..., θℓ) 6= 0, which is a contradiction to (3.2), and hence we
may assume that θ1(x1) 6= 0 with pdeg θ1 ≥ m0. Theorem 2.2 further yields

(3.4)

|m| =

ℓ

Xi=1

pdeg θi.

Together with our assumption 2m0 ≥ |m|, this yields pdeg θi < m0 for all i =
2, ..., ℓ. Thus (3.1) shows that θi(x1) = 0 for all i = 2, ..., ℓ, and θ1(x1) = pxm0

some p ∈ S. Hence

On the other hand, we obtain by (3.6) together with (3.7)

ℓ) ≥ deg Q(AH0, mH0) = |m| − m0.

This inequality, together with (3.8), yields deg p = 0, which shows that θ1 is a

|mH0| = |m| − m0 =

So Theorem 2.2 immediately implies that {θ′

For general multiarrangements, we can show the following:

Proposition 3.5. Let (A, m) multiarrangement with H0 ∈ A. Then (A, m+kδH0)
has a good summand to H0 for all k ≫ 0.

j=1{xj = 0} (i = 1, . . . , r), where x1, . . . , xℓ form a K-basis
Proof. Set Xi := ∩i
of V ∗ and r = rank(A). We may assume that H0 = X1 and H ⊃ Xr for all
H ∈ A. By deﬁnition, for H ∈ AXi \ AXi−1, αH can be chosen to be of the form
αH = a1x1 + . . . + ai−1xi−1 + xi. Then Ai := AXi (i = 1, . . . , r) deﬁnes a ﬁltration
A = Ar ⊃ Ar−1 ⊃ . . . ⊃ A2 ⊃ A1 of A.
We can obtain a supersolvable arrangement B with a ﬁltration B = Br ⊃ Br−1 ⊃
. . . ⊃ B2 ⊃ B1 such that Ai ⊂ Bi for i = 1, . . . , r by adding hyperplanes to
the ﬁltered pieces Ai as follows: First set Br := Ar. Now inductively deﬁne Bi
(i = r − 1, . . . , 2) to be Ai with the additional hyperplanes H ′ with H ′′ ⊃ H ∩ H ′ if
H ′′ /∈ Bi, where H, H ′ ∈ Bi+1 \ Ai are distinct hyperplanes. Finally, set B1 := A1
and the arrangement B is supersolvable by Deﬁnition 2.7.
Now choose a multiplicity mB on B such that mB(H) ≥ m(H) for any H ∈ A,
the hyperplane H0 is heavy in (B, mB), and (B, mB) satisﬁes the assumptions
of Theorem 2.8 as follows. First, we note that, for any distinct hyperplanes

13

PX⊂H∈Ar \Ar−1

H ′, H ′′ ∈ Ar \ Ar−1, there exists the unique L ∈ Ar−1 such that L ⊃ H ′ ∩ H ′′ =:
X. Now replace m(L) by m(L) + k for suﬃciently large k in such a way that
m(H) ≤ m(L) + k. Proceed this replacement to obtain the de-
sired new multiplicity mB. Hence Theorem 2.8 implies that (B, mB) is free and
Theorem 3.4 yields that the free and unbalanced multiarrangement (B, mB) has
a good summand θ0 ∈ D(B, mB) to H0. Now choose k ∈ Z such that mB(H0) =
(m + kδH0)(H0). Since D(A, m + kδH0) ⊃ D(B, mB) by deﬁnition of logarithmic
vector ﬁelds, it holds that θ0 ∈ D(A, m + kδH0), which completes the proof.

By (2.4) the Euler multiplicity coincides with the Ziegler multiplicity for un-

balanced multiarrangements.

Proposition 3.6. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement with H ∈ A such that H is
the heavy hyperplane with multiplicity m0 = m(H). Furthermore choose k ∈ Z
in such a way that (A, m + kδH ) is still unbalanced. Note that k is allowed to be
negative. Then (A, m) is free if and only if (A, m + kδH) is free.

Proof. Assume that (A, m) is free. Theorem 3.4 then implies that exp(A, m) =
(m0, d2, . . . dℓ) holds and (AH0, mH0) is also free with exp(AH0, mH0) = (d2, . . . dℓ).
This Euler-Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0) coincides with the Euler restriction (AH0, m∗)
on AH0 since H0 is a heavy hyperplane. So repeated applications of Theorem 2.5
yields the freeness of (A, m + kδH) since this arrangement is still heavy by assump-
tion. Conversely, if one assumes that (A, m+kδH) is free, the same argument shows
the freeness of (A, m).

Remark 3.7. With the above notation, the Euler-Ziegler multiplicity (AH0, mH0)
coincides with the Euler multiplicity (AH0, m∗) on AH0 by (2.4) as long as H0 is a
locally heavy hyperplane. So, if (A, m) is a free unbalanced multiarrangement, the
above proof shows that (A, m + kδH ) is also a free multiarrangement for all k ∈ Z
such that H0 is a locally heavy hyperplane in (A, m + kδH ).

Theorem 3.8. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement with a ﬁxed hyperplane H0 ∈ A.
Assume that (A, m) has a good summand θ0 ∈ D(A, m) with respect to H0. Then

The proof of Theorem 3.8 is similar to the one for simple arrangements in
Proposition 4.4, 5.4 and 5.5 in [13] by replacing the role played by the Euler
derivation by the derivation with respect to the good summand. We give it here
for the completeness.

14

Proof. Let α be the deﬁning equation of the ﬁxed hyperplane H0. By deﬁnition of
Dp(A, m) we have θ(α, f2, . . . , fp) ∈ αm0S, for θ ∈ Dp(A, m) and f2, . . . , fp ∈ S.
Thus we may deﬁne ∂ : Dp(A, m) → Dp−1(A, m) by

∂(θ)(f2, . . . , fp) :=

(i(α)θ)(f2, . . . , fp)

αm0

=

θ(α, f2, . . . , fp)

where i(α) : Derp(S) → Derp−1(S) is deﬁned as (i(α)δ)(f2, . . . , fp) := δ(α, f2, . . . , fp)
for δ ∈ Derp(S) and fi ∈ S. Thus, this map ∂ is homogeneous of degree −m0 with
∂(φ ∧ ψ) = (∂φ) ∧ ψ + (−1)pφ ∧ (∂ψ) for φ ∈ Dp(A, m) and ψ ∈ Dq(A, m). Since
∂ ◦ ∂ = 0, this yields a complex

Now we use the good summand θ0 to show that this complex is acyclic. Let
δ ∈ Dp(A, m) be a cycle, i.e., ∂δ = 0. By the deﬁnition of Dp(A, m) we know that
θ0 ∧ δ ∈ Dp+1(A, m) which yields with the above skew-commutativity

∂(θ0 ∧ δ) =∂(θ0) ∧ δ + (−1)pθ0 ∧ ∂(δ)

=

δ + 0 = δ.

Hence, δ is a boundary and the complex (3.9) is acylic.
Let H(Dp(A, m), x) be the Hilbert series of the module Dp(A, m). Since the
complex (3.9) is acyclic and the boundary map ∂ is of degree −m0, it holds that

Since ψ(A, m; x, t) is a polynomial in t and x by [5, Theorem 2.5], we can substitute

0 = (−1)ℓψ (A, m; 1, m0) = χ(A, m; m0)

by the deﬁnition of the characteristic polynomial χ(A, m; t) = (−1)ℓψ(A, m; 1, t).

In the situation of a multiarrangement with a good summand we can show the

following.

Lemma 3.9. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement with a good summand with respect
to H0 ∈ A and χ0(A, m; t) the reduced characteristic polynomial. Then it holds
that

χ0(A, m; t) = tℓ−1 − (|m| − m0)tℓ−1 + bH0

2 (A, m)tℓ−2 + · · · + (−1)ℓχ0(A, m; 0).

Proof. By deﬁnition, χ(A, m; t) is of the form

χ(A, m; t) = tℓ − |m|tℓ−1 + b2(A, m)tℓ−2 + · · · + (−1)ℓbℓ(A, m).

Since χ(A, m; t) = (t−m0)χ0(A, m; t), comparing coeﬃcients completes the proof.

The combination of the above results yields a result linking the freeness of
an unbalanced multiarrangement with the freeness of its Euler-Ziegler restriction,
which was ﬁrst proved by Ziegler in [20] for simple arrangements and its Ziegler
restriction.

Theorem 3.10. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement with the heavy hyperplane H0 ∈
A. Then the following are equivalent:

(i) (A, m) is free.

(ii) The Euler-Ziegler restriction (AH0, mH0) is free and the restriction map res1

H0 :

D0(A, m) → D(AH0, mH0) deﬁned in Lemma 3.2 is surjective.

Proof. Proposition 3.5 enables us to choose k > 0 such that (A, m + kδH0) has a
good summand to H0. By Proposition 3.6 (A, m) is free if and only if (A, m+kδH0)
is free. Since (AH0, mH0) = (AH0, (m + kδH0)H0), D0(A, m) = D0(A, m + kδH0)
and the restricition maps coincide, we may assume that (A, m) itself has a good
summand θ0 ∈ D(A, m) to H0.

The implication (i) ⇒ (ii) was shown in Theorem 3.4. For the converse, assume
H0 is surjective, (AH0, mH0) is free and θ1, . . . θℓ−1 form a basis of
i ∈ D0(A, m)

Now we can give generalizations of Theorem 2.2 in [19] and Theorem 3.2 in

[18] in the following.

16

Proposition 3.11. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement in V = Kℓ with a ﬁxed
heavy hyperplane H0 and ℓ ≥ 4. Assume that A is essential. Then (A, m) is free
if and only if (AH0, mH0) is free and (A, m) is locally free along H0, i.e., (AX, mX )
is free for all X ∈ L(A) with X ⊂ H0 and X 6= {0}.

Proof. As in the above proof, we may assume that (A, m) has a good summand
θ0 ∈ D(A, m) to H0 by increasing the multiplicity on H0. Thus, there is a de-
composition D(A, m) = Sθ0 ⊕ D0(A, m). Then the proof is the same as in [19,
Theorem 2.2] which shows the equivalence of the local freeness and the surjectivity
of the residue map. Hence the result follows directly from Theorem 3.10. Here we
give another proof by using the result in [7].

Since the “only if” part is easy, we show the “if” part. Since the S-module
D(A, m) is reﬂexive, so is its direct summand D0(A, m). From now on, consider
the reﬂexive OPℓ−1-module ^D0(A, m), which is the sheaﬁﬁcation of the graded
K[x1, . . . , xℓ]-module D0(A, m). It is known by [11] that the stalk ^D0(A, m)¯x for
¯x ∈ Pℓ−1 is isomorphic to ^D0(Ax, mx)¯x for x ∈ V \ {0}, where ¯x ∈ Pℓ−1 is the point
determined by x ∈ V \ {0}. For x ∈ H0 \ {0}, the multiarrangement (Ax, mx)
is unbalanced and free by the assumptions. Hence Theorem 3.10 shows that the
map res1
H0 is locally surjective, i.e., surjective as a sheaf homomorphism. Thus we
obtain an exact sequence of sheaves on Pℓ−1:

(AH0, mH0) is free by the assumption, ^D (AH0, mH0) splits into the direct sum of
line bundles. Also, clearly

coker( ^D0(A, m)(−1)

·αH0→ ^D0(A, m)) ≃ ^D0(A, m)|H0.

Hence ^D (AH0, mH0) ≃ ^D0(A, m)|H0 also splits into the direct sum of line bundles.
Then apply the splitting criterion of reﬂexive sheaves (Theorem 0.2, [7]) to conﬁrm
that ^D0(A, m) splits, equivalently (A, m) is free.

sume that (A, m) has a good summand to H0 by increasing the multiplicity of
H0. By Lemma 3.2 there are well-deﬁned restriction maps resp
0(A, m) →
Dp(AH0, mH0) for p = 0, 1, 2. Denote by M p ⊂ Dp(AH0, mH0) the image of the
maps resp
H0. Our ﬁrst aim is to deduce a relation between the Hilbert series of
M p and the one of Dp(A, m) via the modules Dp
0(A, m). Since (A, m) has a good
summand to H0, the complex (3.9) is again acyclic and we have ker ∂ = Dp
0(A, m).
This yields short exact sequences for p = 0, 1, 2, 3:

(i) (A, m) is free.

(ii) bH0

2 (A, m) = b2(AH0, mH0).

(iii) (A, m) is locally free in codimension 3 along H0, i.e., (AX, mX ) is free for all

Note that (i) ⇒ (iii) follows immediately from Proposition 2.6. Also, Proposi-
tion 3.12 applied to each summand of (3.16) shows that (ii) and (iii) are equiva-

We will prove (iii) ⇒ (i) by induction on ℓ. If ℓ = 3, then L3(A) = {0} and
(AX, mX) = (A, m) for X ∈ L3(A). Hence (A, m) is free. Next, let ℓ ≥ 4. We

is a localization of (AH0, mH0), it is free by Proposition 2.6. Finally, we show
that (AZ, mZ) satisﬁes (iii) and hence by induction assumption, (AZ, mZ) is free.
So let W ∈ L3(AZ) with W ⊂ H0. Then W ∈ L3(A), and by deﬁnition of the
localization,

(3.17)

((AZ)W , (mZ)W ) = (AW , mW ).

By assumption, (AW , mW ) is free. Hence ((AZ)W , (mZ)W ) is free too by (3.17).
Therefore, (AZ, mZ) satisﬁes (iii) and the proof of (1) is completed.

For (2) choose k ∈ Z≥0 such that H0 is a heavy hyperplane in (A, m + kδH0).
Then it clearly holds that (AH0, mH0) = (AH0, (m + kδH0)H0) and bH0
2 (A, m) =
bH0
2 (A, m + kδH0). Hence by (1), (A, m + kδH0) is free. Finally, Remark 3.7 also
implies that (A, m) is free, since H0 is locally heavy in (A, m).

4 Heavy ﬂags

In this section we will prove Theorem 1.6 and Theorem 1.7. First, we quote the
following lemma.

Lemma 4.1. [3, Lemma 4.3] Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement with exp(A, m) =
(d1, d2). Then for H ∈ A it holds that exp(A, m−δH ) = (d1 −1, d2) or exp(A, m−
δH ) = (d1, d2 − 1). In particular, for two multiplicities m, m′ : A → Z>0 with
m(H) ≥ m′(H) for all H ∈ A, it holds that b2(A, m) ≥ b2(A, m′).

Second, we show the following lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Let (A, m) be a (possibly unbalanced) multiarrangement in V = K2
with exp(A, m) = (d1, d2) and d1 ≤ d2. Then for any H ∈ A which is not heavy,
it holds that

(4.1)

In particular,

m(H) ≤ d1 ≤ d2 ≤ |m| − m(H).

(4.2)

b2(A, m) = d1d2 ≥ m(H)(|m| − m(H))

for any multiarrangement (A, m) of rank two and H ∈ H.

Proof. Fix a hyperplane H ∈ A which is not heavy in (A, m), i.e., m(H) ≤
|m| − m(H). Set k := |m| − 2m(H). Then (A, m + kδH) is unbalanced with
exp(A, m + kδH) = (m(H) + k, m(H) + k). Note that (4.1) holds for (A, m + kδH).
Now taking k → 0 with Lemma 4.1 completes the proof.

21

Now we prove Theorems 1.6, 1.7 and Corollary 1.8.

Proof of Theorem 1.6. If H is heavy in (A, m) we have BH
2 (A, m)
and b2(AH, mH) = b2(AH, m∗). Hence the inequality was already shown in Theo-
rem 1.2. Now assume that H is not heavy in (A, m). We proceed in the following
three steps.

2 (A, m) = bH

(i) bH

2 (A, m) ≥ BH

2 (A, m): By the inequality (4.2) of Lemma 4.2, we obtain

2 (A, m) − BH

2 (A, m)

(|mX| − m(H)) − (|m| − m(H))

 − m(H)(|m| − m(H))
 = 0.

(ii) BH

2 (A, m) ≥ b2(AH, mH ): The quantities BH

2 (A, m) and b2(AH, mH ) are
clearly independent of m(H). Hence we may assume that H is the heavy
hyperplane in (A, m). Then BH
2 (A, m) has already been proven
in Theorem 1.2.

2 (A, m) ≥ bH

(iii) b2(AH, mH) ≥ b2(AH, m∗): By the local-global formula in Proposition 2.4
we can reduce to the case AH is an arrangement of rank two. The inequal-
ity (4.1) and the deﬁnition of the Euler multiplicity show that mH (X) ≥
m∗(X) for any X ∈ AH. Then Lemma 4.1 completes the proof.

H ∈ A. Theorem 2.10 applied to A yields

Proof of Theorem 1.7. Agree that A = (cid:0)AX0, mX0(cid:1), where mX0(H) = 1 for all
(4.3) A is free ⇔(cid:0)AX1, mX1(cid:1) is free and b2(A) −(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)mX0(cid:12)(cid:12) − 1(cid:1) = b2(cid:0)AX1, mX1(cid:1) .
Note that (cid:16)(cid:0)AXi(cid:1)Xi+1 ,(cid:0)mXi(cid:1)Xi+1(cid:17) = (cid:0)AXi+1, mXi+1(cid:1) and the multiarrangements
(cid:0)AXi+1, mXi+1(cid:1) are unbalanced with the heavy hyperplane Xi+2 ∈ AXi+1 for i =

22

1, . . . , ℓ − 3. Hence we can apply Theorem 1.2 to obtain, for i = 1, . . . , ℓ − 3,

(4.4)

(cid:0)AXi, mXi(cid:1) is free ⇔
(cid:0)AXi+1, mXi+1(cid:1) is free and bXi+1

2

(cid:0)AXi, mXi(cid:1) = b2(cid:0)AXi+1, mXi+1(cid:1) .

(4.5) A is free ⇔ bXi+1

So we can iteratively link the statements (4.3) and (4.4) to obtain

Since(cid:0)AXℓ−2, mXℓ−2(cid:1) is a multiarrangement of rank 2, it is free by Proposition 2.1.
(cid:0)AXi, mXi(cid:1) = b2(cid:0)AXi+1, mXi+1(cid:1) for all i = 0, . . . , ℓ − 3.

Since Theorem 2.10 and Theorem 1.2 imply that bXi+1
for all i = 0, . . . , ℓ − 3, the right-hand side of (4.5) is equivalent to

(cid:0)AXi, mXi(cid:1) ≥ b2(cid:0)AXi+1, mXi+1(cid:1)

(4.6)

Noting that

bXi+1
2

(AXi, mXi) = b2(AXi, mXi) − mXi(Xi+1)(|mXi| − mXi(Xi+1))

we ﬁnd that (4.6) is in fact equivalent to

ℓ−3

Xi=0

(4.7)

b2(A) −

mXi(Xi+1)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)mXi(cid:12)(cid:12) − mXi(Xi+1)(cid:1) = b2(cid:0)AXℓ−2, mXℓ−2(cid:1) .
Since exp(cid:0)AXℓ−2, mXℓ−2(cid:1) =(cid:0)mXℓ−2(Xℓ−1),(cid:12)(cid:12)mXℓ−2(cid:12)(cid:12) − mXℓ−2(Xℓ−1)(cid:1) we have

b2(cid:0)AXℓ−2, mXℓ−2(cid:1) = mXℓ−2(Xℓ−1)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)mXℓ−2(cid:12)(cid:12) − mXℓ−2(Xℓ−1)(cid:1) .

This shows that (4.7) is equivalent to

Since (cid:12)(cid:12)mXi(cid:12)(cid:12) =Pℓ−1

b2(A) =

ℓ−2

Xi=0

mXi(Xi+1)(cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)mXi(cid:12)(cid:12) − mXi(Xi+1)(cid:1) .

j=i mXj (Xj+1), the above equality is equivalent to

b2(A) =

ℓ−2

Xi=0
= X0≤i<j≤ℓ−1

mXi(Xi+1)  ℓ−1
Xj=i+1

mXj (Xj+1))!

mXi(Xi+1)mXj (Xj+1)

This completes the proof, since by (4.5) this is equivalent to (A, m) being free.

23

Proof of Corollary 1.8. Corollary 1.8 follows directly from Theorem 1.7, since the
characteristic polynomial χ(A; t), and in particular also b2(A), of a simple arrang-
ment A is combinatorially determined. The same holds true for the multiplicities
of the Euler-Ziegler restrictions. For the supersolvablity, use Proposition 4.2 in
[2].

Corollary 1.8 says that Terao’s conjecture holds true in the category of arrange-

ments with a heavy ﬂag.

Furthermore, we can show the following theorem, which links the freeness of

an unbalanced multiarrangement in K3 with its combinatorics.

Corollary 4.3. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangement in V = K3 with a heavy hy-

perplane H0 ∈ A. Assume that (cid:0)AH0, mH0(cid:1) and (AX, mX) are either unbalanced,

or consist of up to three hyperplanes for all X ∈ L2(A). Then the freeness of A
depends only on the combinatorics of (A, m), i.e., on L(A) and the multiplicity
function m.

Proof. Let (B, m) be a multiarrangement of rank two.
If (B, m) has the heavy
hyperplane H ∈ B, then exp(B, m) = (m(H), |m| − m(H)). If B = {H1, H2}, then
exp(B, m) = (m(H1), m(H2)). If |B| = 3 and (B, m) is balanced, Wakamiko showed
in [16], that exp(B, m) = (⌊ |m|
2 ⌉). Hence in all cases, the exponents are

determined combinatorially. So by the assumption, b2(cid:0)AH0, mH0(cid:1) and b2(AX, mX )
2 (A, m). Since (cid:0)AH0, mH0(cid:1) in K2 is free, we

for all X ∈ L2(A) are determined combinatorially as well. By the local-global
formula in Proposition 2.1, so is bH0
can determine the freeness of A combinatorially with Theorem 1.2.

2 ⌋, ⌈ |m|

For the case of the Weyl arrangement of the type A3, all non-trivial localizations
and restrictions have at most three hyperplanes. So Corollary 4.3 immediately
implies Corollary 1.4 from the introduction.

Next, we consider the following example of a Weyl multiarrangement of type
A3 to show that the heaviness assumptions in Theorem 1.2 can not be dropped in
general.

Example 4.4. Let (A, m) be deﬁned by

x3y3z3(x − y)3(y − z)3(z − x)3 = 0.

Then this is free (see [14] for example), but bH
BH

2 (A, m) = 58 > b2(AH, mH) = 56 for any H ∈ A.

2 (A, m) = 107 − 3(18 − 3) = 62 >

5 Multi-freeness and supersolvability

In this section we study the relation between the freeness of multiarrangements
(A, m) and the geometry of the underlying simple arrangement A. For example,
if any multiplicity on A is free, then A is known to be the product of one and two-
dimensional simple arrangements ([6]). Hence freeness aﬀects the geometry of the
simple arrangement on which multiplicities are. Here, by using the results of the
previous sections, we show a similar result in a wider category of free arrangements.
Theorem 5.1. Let (A, m) be an essential free multiarrangement in V = Kℓ with
Xi ∈ Li(A) for i = 0, . . . , ℓ such that Xi is the heavy hyperplane in (AXi−1, mXi−1)
for i = 1, . . . , ℓ − 1. Then A is supersolvable (hence free) with a supersolvable
ﬁltration AX1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ AXℓ−1 ⊂ AXℓ = A.
Proof. Set mi := mXi−1(Xi) and deﬁne the ﬁltration AX1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ AXℓ−1 ⊂ AXℓ =
A. Now let AXi \ AXi−1 = {H i
ti} for i = 1, . . . , ℓ and some ti. First, by
Theorem 1.2, (AX1, mX1) is free with exp(AX1, mX1) = (m2, . . . , mℓ) and

1, . . . , H i

(5.1)

bH

2 (A, m) = b2(AX1, mX1) = X2≤i<j≤ℓ

Second, we can show that

To show the above, note that

m(H i

j) = mi.

ti

Xj=1

AXi \ AXi−1 = {H ∈ A | Xi−1 6⊂ H, H ∩ Xi−1 = Xi}.

Hence the deﬁnition of the Ziegler restriction ensures that

Set Laway := {Y ∈ L2(A) | X1 6⊃ Y } and Ldif f := {Y ∈ Laway | H i

By (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) are both equalities. So

XY ∈Laway\Ldif f

b2(AY , mY ) = 0,

s ∩ H i

k ⊃ Y with i 6= j. Assume j > i. Then codim H i

r = Y for some s 6= r and Y ∈ Laway, then
i.e., Laway = Ldif f . Hence if H i
there is H j
k = 3 by
the deﬁnition of the ﬁltration. Hence Y ∈ L3(A), which is a contradiciton. Thus
j < i in this situation, which shows that the given ﬁltation is a supersolvable
ﬁltration.

s ∩ H i

t ∩ H j

As a corollary, we can relate the non-supersolvability with non-freeness and

heavy ﬂags.

Corollary 5.2. Let (A, m) be a multiarrangment with a heavy ﬂag, as in the above
notation. If A is not supersolvable, then (A, m) is not free.

The Euler restriction of a simple free arrangement is not necessarily free shown
by Edelman and Reiner in [9]. However, in our setting we can show the following.

Corollary 5.3. Let A be a free arrangement and {Xi}ℓ
AXi is supersolvable for all i = 1, . . . , ℓ − 1.
i = 1, . . . , ℓ − 1.

i=0 be a heavy ﬂag. Then
In particular, AXi is free for all

Proof. By Theorem 1.2 the unbalanced multiarrangments (AXi, mXi) are free and
satisfy the conditions of Theorem 5.1. Hence Theorem 5.1 completes the proof.

Example 5.4. Let (A, m) be deﬁned by

x1y2z7(x + y)1(y − z)2(z − x)1 = 0.

Then (A, m) has the heavy ﬂag H := {z = 0} ∈ (A, m) and {y = z = 0} ∈
(AH, mH) but it can easily be checked that the arrangement A is not supersolvable
(assume char K 6= 2). Hence, (A, m) can not be free by Corolary 5.2.

Let B in V = K4 be deﬁned by

xyw(x − z)(y − z)(y − w)

2

(z − kw) = 0.

Yk=−2

Then B has the heavy ﬂag H := {w = 0} ∈ B, L := {w = z = 0} ∈ (BH , mH) and
K := {w = z = y = 0} ∈ (BL, mL), with mV (H) = 1, mH(L) = 5, mL(K) = 3
and mK(0) = 2. So the RHS of (1.1) evaluates to 1(5+3+2)+5(3+2)+3·2 = 41.
Further, we can compute b2(B) = 41, which implies that B is free with exp(A) =
(1, 5, 3, 2) by Theorem 1.7.

Hence, Corolary 5.3 implies that the simple arrangements BH and BL are su-

persolvable (hence free) as well.
