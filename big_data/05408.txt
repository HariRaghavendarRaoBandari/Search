Abstract

It is shown that a.a.s. as soon as a Kronecker graph becomes connected its
diameter is bounded by a constant.

1. Introduction

A Kronecker graph is a random graph with vertex set V = {0, 1}n, where
the probability that two vertices u, v ∈ V are adjacent strongly depends on
the structure of the vectors u = (u1, . . . , un), and v = (v1, . . . , vn). More
speciﬁcally, let P be a symmetric matrix

P = (cid:18)

0

0 β γ(cid:19),

where zeros and ones are labels of rows and columns of P, α, β, γ ∈ [0, 1], and
α ≥ γ. In the Kronecker graph K(n, P) two vertices u = (u1, . . . , un), v =
(v1, . . . , vn) ∈ V = {0, 1}n are adjacent with probability

pu,v =

P[ui, vi],

independently for each such pair.

Kronecker graphs were introduced by Leskovec, Chakrabarti, Kleinberg
and Faloutsos in [1] to model some real world networks (see also [2], [3], [4]).
Since then they have been studied by several authors but their properties
are still far from being well understood (see [5] and references therein). In
particular, Radcliﬀe and Young [6] determined the exact threshold for the
property that K(n, P) is connected, supplementing a slightly weaker result
of Mahdian and Xu [7].

n→∞

P(K(n, P) is connected) =

0 if β + γ = 1, β 6= 1
0 if β = 1, α = γ = 0
1 if β = 1, α > 0 and γ = 0
1 if β + γ > 1.

The main result of this work states that as soon as K(n, P) becomes

connected its diameter is bounded by a constant.

Theorem 2. If either β + γ > 1, or β = 1, α > 0 and γ = 0, then there
exists a constant a = a(α, β, γ) such that a.a.s. diam(K(n, P)) ≤ a.

2. The idea of the proof

In order to sketch our argument let us recall how one shows that the
diameter is bounded from above for the binomial model of random graph
G(N, p), and for many other random graph models. Typically, since random
graphs are good expanders, it is proven ﬁrst that for some small k the k-
neighbourhood of each vertex is much larger than √N . Then, in the second
part of the proof, one argues that since two random subsets of vertices of size
larger than √N intersect with large probability, each pair of vertices is a.a.s.
connected by a path of length at most 2k. In [7], the diameter of K(n, P)
was examined under condition γ < β < α. This case was solved using
the standard results for binomial random graphs. However, for other cases
this procedure fails completely. The main reason is that most neighbours
of a given vertex v have a similar structure, and so the events ‘x ∼ v’ and
‘y ∼ v’ are strongly correlated. Thus, the k-neighbourhood of a given vertex
is very far from being a random subset, which is crucial for the second step
of the procedure. Even more importantly, we do not understand expanding
properties of K(n, P) and it is hard to control how fast the k-neighbourhoods
of a vertex K(n, P) grows, which in most of the other random graph models
is quite easy to investigate.
Thus, we apply a diﬀerent approach. We consider two vertices, v and u
which are very similar to each other (more speciﬁcally, we choose both of
them from the middle layer of the n-cube and assume that they are at small
Hamming distance from each other). Then we generate their neighbourhoods
at the same time until, for some k, we observe that the k-neighbourhood of
v would not expand on an expected rate. This is because many, in fact

2

most, candidates for (k + 1)-neighbours of v has already been placed in the
i-neighbourhood of v for some i ≤ k. However, the chance that a vertex x
is in the i-neighbourhood of v is roughly the same as the probability that
x is in the i-neighbourhood of u so, if most potential (k + 1)-neighbours of
v are already in its k-th neighbourhood, many of them are also in the k-
th neighbourhood of u. Consequently, there is a path of length at most 2k
joining v and u.

The structure of the paper is the following. First we treat a special case
β = 1. Then we present the crucial part of our argument showing that
the subgraph induced in of K(n, P) by its middle layer has a.a.s. a small
diameter. Finally, we complete the proof showing that a.a.s. each vertex of
K(n, P) is connected to the middle layer by a short path.

3. Case β = 1

In this section we show that if β = 1, α > 0, and γ = 0, then the diameter
of K(n, P) is a.a.s. bounded by a constant. This set of parameters α, β, γ is
somewhat special as it is the only case, when γ + β = 1 and still K(n, P) is
a.a.s. connected.
We introduce some notation, we shall use throughout the paper. By
d(v, u) we denote a Hamming distance between two vertices v and u and
w(v) stands for the weight of a vertex v = (v1, . . . , vn), i.e. the number of
ones in its label

w(v) =

vi.

nXi=1

For a vertex v = (v1, . . . , vn), we set ¯v = (1 − v1, . . . , 1 − vn).

Now let us go back to the case β = 1. Note that

P(v ∼ ¯v) = βn = 1,

and observe that either v or ¯v has weight at least n/2. Thus, to show the
assertion it is enough to verify that a.a.s. there exists a path of bounded
length between every pair of vertices in R deﬁned as

R = {v ∈ V : w(v) ≥ n/2}.

Let v ∈ R be a vertex of weight n/2 ≤ w(v) < n. We show that it is
joined to the vertex (1, 1, . . . , 1) by a short path. To this end let η ∈ (0, 1)

denote the largest solution of the equality

αη(α2 + 1)1/2 = 1 + η.

Let u ∈ R be such that w(u) = w(v) + t and d(v, u) = t, where 0 < t < ηn.
Consider a vertex x such that if vi = 0, then xi = 1, and w(x) = n−w(v) + j,
for some j ∈ [w(v) − 1]. Then

P(x ∼ v, x ∼ u) = αjβn−jαj+tβn−j−t = α2j+t.

Hence the probability ρ(v, u) that v and u have no common neighbours in
K(n, P) is bounded from above by

2

Thus a.a.s. each such pair u, v ∈ R has a common neighbour. Therefore
every vertex in K(n, P) is a.a.s. connected to a vertex (1, . . . , 1) by a path
of length at most 1/2η. Consequently, a.a.s. between each pair of vertices of
K(n, P) there exists a path of length at most 1/η + 2, where, let us recall, η
is a constant which depends only on α.

4. The middle layer

In this section we deal with the case when β + γ > 1. Let us recall that
we always assume that α ≥ γ however, since if we decrease α the diameter
can only increase, we may and shall assume that α = γ. Furthermore, for
technical reasons, we assume also that n is even; if this is not the case one can
split K(n, P) into two disjoint random subgraphs for which the underlying
cube is of even dimension, use the result to infer that each of them is a.a.s.
of bounded diameter and ﬁnally verify that a.a.s. there exists at least one
edge joining two of them.

Denote by H a subgraph of K(n, P) induced by the middle layer, i.e. by

the set of vertices

U = {v ∈ V (K(n, P)) : w(v) = n/2} .

4

In this section we show that the diameter of H is bounded and the fol-

lowing theorem holds.

Theorem 3. For every α = γ and β + γ > 1, there exists a constant c, such
that a.a.s.

diam(H) < c .

In order to verify Theorem 3 we show that a.a.s. each pair of vertices v
and u such that d(v, u) is small is connected in average by at least n2/4 edge-
disjoint paths of bounded length. However, although the expected number
of short paths between v and u grows exponentially it is hard to control
directly the size of the largest family of edge-disjoint such paths. Thus, we
use the following simple and natural approach. Each edge of H we label
randomly and independently with one of n2 labels, i.e. we split H randomly
into n2 edge disjoint parts. Of course each of n2 parts is the same random
object, which can be obtained by keeping edges of H with probability n−2.
We denote it by H. The crucial part of our argument is captured by the
following lemma.

Lemma 4. For every α = γ and β + γ > 1, there exist constants ǫ > 0 and
ξ > 1 such that for each pair v, u of vertices of H such that d(u, v) < ǫn
the probability that u and v are connected in H by a path of length at most
4⌈logξ 2⌉ is at least 1/4.
Proof. Let u, v be two vertices from U such that d(u, v) < ǫn, where ǫ > 0 is
to be chosen later on. We show that u and v are connected by a short path

in a subgraph bH of H which is deﬁned as follows.
and, since w(u) = w(v) = n/2, |I| is even. The vertex set of bH consists only

Let I be the set of those i ∈ [n] for which ui 6= vi. Clearly |I| = d(u, v)
of those vertices which have precisely |I|/2 ones inside I and, consequently,
exactly (n − |I|)/2 ones in [n] \ I. We denote it by UI, i.e.

UI = {x ∈ U : |{i ∈ I : xi = 1}| = |{i ∈ I : xi = 0}| = |I|/2}.

Note that clearly u, v ∈ UI.
edges which fulﬁll the following condition:
α

Now we delete from H some edges. So ﬁrstly, we leave in bH only those

(1)

|{i : xi = yi} \ I| =

α + β

(n − |I|) .

5

Furthermore, when computing the probability that vertices x, y for which the
above holds are adjacent we would like to ‘ignore’ the part of x and y which
belong to I. Note that the probability that such a given pair is connected
by an edge in H is always at least

ρ = ρ(α, β) = α

α+β (n−|I|)β

β

α+β (n−|I|)(min{α, β})|I|n−2.

(2)

Now, each edge of H for which the probability of existence ρ′ is larger than ρ
above we delete with probability ρ/ρ′. The edges which remain after these

a natural permutation of coordinates of x induces a bijection of UI onto
itself which transforms x into y and which preserves measure, i.e. which

(such as u and v) and all other z ∈ UI the probability that z is adjacent to x
is precisely the same as the probability that z is adjacent to y. Furthermore,

procedures are the edges of bH.
Note that for every vertices x and y of bH which diﬀer only on the set I
all vertices of bH are, in a way, equivalent. More precisely, for every x, y ∈ UI
transform bH onto itself.
We shall show that degrees of vertices of bH increase exponentially with n.
n−w(v)Xs=0 (cid:18)w(v)
w(v)Xr=0

Let us ﬁrst make the following useful observation. It is easy to see (cf. [7])
that the expected size of neighbourhood of a vertex v in K(n, P) is equal to

(cid:19)αrβw(v)−rαsβn−w(v)−s = (α + β)n.

r (cid:19)(cid:18)n − w(v)

s

Thus, the largest term in the sums on the left hand size is at least as large as
(α + β)n/n2. Since we shall often refer to this fact let us state it explicitly.
For every natural numbers n, w and positive constants α, β < 1 we have

α+β w(cid:19)(cid:18) n − w

α+β n ≥ (α + β)n/n2.

(3)

Using the above inequality we can easily estimate degrees of vertices in bH.
Let us denote by bN(x) the set of all neighbours of x in bH, and, more generally,
by bNi(x) we denote the i-th neighbourhood of x (i.e. the set of all y which
lies at the distance i from x in bH). Then the following holds.

Fact 5. Let ǫ > 0 be a small constant and let I be a given subset of [n] such
that |I| ≤ ǫn. Then, if ǫ > 0 is small enough, there exists a constant ξ > 1

6

such that for every x ∈ UI we have

P(cid:16)|bN(x)| ≥ ξn(cid:17) = 1 − o(1) .

α

Proof. For a given x ∈ UI the random variable bN (x) has the binomial dis-

tribution B(M, ρ), where

and ρ is given by (2). From (3) and the fact that |I| < ǫn we get

M =(cid:18) (n − |I|)/2
α+β (n − |I|)/2(cid:19)2
α+β (n − |I|)/2(cid:19)2
EbN (x) = (min{α, β})|I|(cid:18) (n − |I|)/2
Hence, if ǫ is small enough, for some constant ξ > 1 we have EbN (x) ≥ 2ξn and

the assertion follows from either Chernoﬀ’s or Chebyshev’s inequalities.

In fact we shall show a slightly stronger inequality. Let us ﬁrst split the set

shall show that

bN(v) randomly into two sets bN(H)(v) and bN(T )(v) by tossing for each vertex
of bN (v) a symmetric coin.
In the same way we partition bN (u) into sets
bN(H)(u) and bN(T )(u). Furthermore, let bN −y
of x in bH from which we removed an edge {x, y} if such an edge exists. We
P [x∈ bN(T )(v) bN −v

Let us assume that (5) does not hold, i.e. that we have

k−1(x) ∩ [y∈ bN(H)(u) bN −u

We shall show that (6) leads to a contradiction.
Let us start with a simple but crucial observation. In order to check if

k−1(x) and then gen-
k−1(y) until the moment when we meet the
ﬁrst vertex which belongs to both of these sets. But the distribution of

P [x∈ bN(T )(v) bN −v
[x∈ bN(T )(v) bN −v
holds we need ﬁrst to generate the set Sx∈ bN(T )(v) bN −v
erate vertices of Sy∈ bN(H)(u) bN −u
k−1(y) is identical withSy∈ bN(H)(v) bN −v
Sy∈ bN(H)(u) bN −u
P [x∈ bN(T )(v) bN −v
k−1(y) 6= ∅
k−1(x) ∩ [y∈ bN(H)(u) bN −u
≥ P [x∈ bN(T )(v) bN −v
k−1(y) 6= ∅
where we have inequality instead of equality because, perhaps, bN(T )(v) ∩
bN(H)(u) 6= ∅. Hence, from (6) it follows that
k−1(x) ∩ [y∈ bN(H)(v) bN −v

k−1(x) ∩ [y∈ bN(H)(v) bN −v

k−1(y). Thus,

P [x∈ bN(T )(v) bN −v
P(cid:16)∃x,y∈ bN (v),x6=y : bN −v

k−1(x) ∩ bN −v

k−1(y) 6= ∅ < 1/4,
k−1(y) 6= ∅(cid:17) < 1/2.

and, since we may toss a coin after we generate all vertices from bN(v),

(7)

The above inequality seems to lead to contradiction at very ﬁrst sight. In-

deed, since the degree of vertices of bH grows like ξn, after ﬁnite number of
steps we explore all the vertices of bH and simply there will be no place for

8

new vertices. However, keeping in mind that the neighbours of a vertex of bH
are strongly correlated, we have to exclude the possibility that each bN −v
k−1(x) and bN −v
spans a dense graph yet for diﬀerent x and y the sets bN −v

Thus, let J be a random variable, deﬁned as

k−1(x)
k−1(y)

are disjoint.

J = min{i : |bNi(v)| ≤ ξni/2} .

Note that since for k = 2⌈logξ 2⌉ we have ξnk/2 > 2n, J takes only ﬁnite
number of values, more precisely, we have J ∈ [k]. Let j ∈ [k] maximize the
value of P(J = j). Then, clearly,

(8)

contradicting (8).

P(cid:16)|bNj−1(v)| ≥ ξn(j−1)/2 & |bNj(v)| ≤ ξnj/2(cid:17) ≥ P(J = j) ≥ 1/k .
Since with large probability we have |bN(v)| ≥ ξn, and due to (8) for each
x ∈ bN (v) we have |bNj−1(x)| ∼ |bNj−1(v)| ≥ ξn(j−1)/2, then, clearly, if most of
bNj−1(x), bNj−1(y) are disjoint (see (6)) we must also have |bNj(v)| ≥ ξn(j+1)/2
probability 1 − o(1) we have |bN(v)| ≥ ξn (Fact 5). Furthermore, since for
every x ∈ bN (v) the random variables |bNj−1(x)| and |bNj−1(v)| have identical
expectation, from (8) it follows that for every x ∈ bN1(v) we have

distribution, and the degree of x is binomially distributed with exponential

Let us make the above heuristic argument rigorous. Recall that with

(9)

j−1(x)| ≥ ξn(j−1)/2/2(cid:17) ≥ 1/(2k) .

P(cid:16)|bN −v

Let us generate all neighbours of v and order them in a sequence x1, x2, . . . , xr,
where, as we have just observed, with probability 1 − o(1) we have r ≥ ξn.
Then, for each xi we generate a set Wi in the following way. We set W1 =
j−1(x1). Once all sets W1, . . . , Wi−1 are found, we generate vertices of the
(j − 1)-neighbourhoods of xi one by one and stop when we either ﬁnd the
s=1 Ws.
j−1(xi) generated

bN −v
whole neighbourhood bN −v
In this latter case we set as Wi the set of all vertices of bN −v

j−1(xi), or when we ﬁrst hit an element ofSi−1

so far and mark xi as bad.
Fact 6. With probability 1 − o(1) none of the vertices x1, x2, . . . , xt, where
t = ξ2n/3, is bad.

9

Proof. During the execution of the procedure of generating W1, W2, . . . , Wr,
the probabilities θi that Wi is bad increases with i. Thus, for every i ∈ [t],
θi ≤ θt+1. On the other hand the probability that there are bad vertices
among xt+1, xt+2, . . . , xr is bounded from below by 1 − (1 − θt+1)r−t while,
from our assumption (7), it is bounded from above by 1/2. Hence,

1 − (1 − θt+1)r−t < 1/2 ,

and so, very crudely, θt+1 ≤ ξ−3n/4. Thus, the probability that one of vertices
x1, . . . , xt is bad is bounded from above by

θi ≤ tθt+1 ≤ ξ2n/3ξ−3n/4 = o(1).

j−1(xi)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
t[i=1 bN −v

Since with probability 1 − o(1) sets Wi, i = 1, 2, . . . , t, are disjoint and
j−1(xi), and since each of such sets with probability 1/(2k)

have size at least ξ(j−1)n/2/2, with probability 1 − o(1) we have

/(3k) ≥ tξ(j−1)n/2/(6k) > ξjn/2

contradicting (8). Thus, (6) leads to a contradiction and Lemma 4 holds.

Proof of Theorem 3. Let ǫ and ξ be constants for which the assertion of
Lemma 4 holds. Consider two vertices v, u of H such that d(u, v) < ǫn and
let Xv,u denote the maximum number of edge-disjoint path of length at most
4⌈logξ 2⌉ joining v and u in H. From Lemma 4 it follows that EXv,u ≥ n2/4.
Since adding or removing a single edge cannot aﬀect the value of Xv,u by
more than one, and the fact that Xv,u ≥ m can be veriﬁed by exposing only
4m⌈logξ 2⌉ edges, from Talagrand’s inequality (see, for instance, [8], Theo-
rem 2.29) we get that for some constant η = η(ǫ, ξ) > 0

P(Xv,u < n2/8) ≤ exp(−ηn2) .

Thus, by the ﬁrst moment method a.a.s. each pair of vertices v, u, of H such
that d(v, u) ≤ ǫn is connected by a path of length at most 4⌈logξ 2⌉. To
complete the proof it is enough to observe that for every pair of vertices u, u′
of H one can ﬁnd a sequence

u = u0, u1, . . . , ur = u′

10

such that for i ∈ [r], d(ui, ui−1) < ǫn, and r < 2/ǫ. Consequently,

diam(H) ≤ 8⌈logξ 2/ǫ⌉.

5. A ﬁnal touch: reaching the middle layer

In this section we prove that a.a.s. every vertex of K(n, P) is joined to

the middle layer by a short path, i.e. the following result holds.

Theorem 7. For every α = γ and β + γ > 1 there exists c′ = c′(α, β)
such that a.a.s. every vertex v of K(n, P) is connected by a path of length at
most c′ to the middle layer of K(n, P).

Theorem 7 is a direct consequence of the following three lemmata.

Lemma 8. Let α = γ and β + γ > 1. Then a.a.s. each vertex v of K(n, P)

with v. There are precisely

α+β w(v) and α

Hence, by the ﬁrst moment method, the probability that K(n, P) contains a

Lemma 9. Let α = γ and β + γ > 1, ǫ > 0, and let

b = log| α−β

Then a.a.s. every vertex v of K(n, P) such that |w(v)−n/2| > ǫn is connected
by a path of length at most b to a vertex u with weight w(u) such that

Proof. By Lemma 8, a.a.s. for each vertex v there exists a path

and so the assertion follows.

(α + β)1−ǫ(4αβ)ǫ > 1.

Then a.a.s. every vertex v of K(n, P) of weight w(v) such that |w(v)−n/2| ≤
ǫn/2 has a neighbour with weight n/2.

Proof. For a given vertex v, let |w(v) − n/2| = ηn/2, where η ≤ ǫ. Let us
choose (1 − η)n/2 ones and (1 − η)n/2 zeros in the label of v. Let A denote
α+β (1 − η)n/2 ones among
the set of those vertices, which have precisely
the chosen one-positions in the label of v, a α
α+β (1 − η)n/2 zeros among the
chosen zero-positions in the label of v, and have ηn/2 zeros among remaining
ηn positions. Then

Furthermore, for every u ∈ A, the probability that u is a neighbour of v is

Let X(v) be a random variable which counts neighbours of v in A. Then, by

As η ≤ ǫ, from (10) we get

EX(v) ≥ ζ n,
for some ζ > 1. Moreover for every u ∈ A,

w(u) =

By Chernoﬀ’s inequality, with probability at least 1− exp(−EX(v)/8), v has
a neighbour with weight n/2. Thus, the probability that some vertex v of
weight w(v) such that

|w(v) − n/2| ≤ ǫn/2 ,

has no neighbours of weight n/2 tends to 0 as n → ∞.
Proof of Theorem 7. Theorem 7 is a straightforward consequence of Lem-
mata 8, 9, and 10.

Now it is easy to complete the proof of Theorem 2.

Proof of Theorem 2. From Theorem 7 we know that for some constant c′
from every vertex v of K(n, P) we can reach the middle layer in at
a.a.s.
most c′ steps. Moreover, Theorem 3 states that for some constant c a.a.s.
the diameter of the subgraph of K(n, P) induced by the middle layer is at
most c. Consequently, the diameter of K(n, P) is a.a.s. bounded from above
by c + 2c′.
