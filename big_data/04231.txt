We show that the category of continuous representations of the dth direct power of
the absolute Galois group of Qp on ﬁnite dimensional Fp-vector spaces (resp. ﬁnitely
generated Zp-modules, resp. ﬁnite dimensional Qp-vector spaces) is equivalent to the
category of étale (ϕ, Γ)-modules over a d-variable Laurent-series ring over Fp (resp. over
Zp, resp. over Qp).

Introduction

This note serves as a complement to the work [11] where we relate multivariable (ϕ, Γ)-
modules to smooth modulo pn representations of a split reductive group G over Qp. The goal
here is to show that the category of d-variable (ϕ, Γ)-modules is equivalent to the category of
representations of the dth direct power of the absolute Galois group of Qp.

Let K be a ﬁnite extension of Qp with ring of integers OK, prime element ̟, and residue

ﬁeld κ. For a ﬁnite set ∆ let GQp,∆ :=Qα∈∆ Gal(Qp/Qp) denote the direct power of the ab-

solute Galois group of Qp indexed by ∆. We denote by Repκ(GQp,∆) (resp. by RepOK (GQp,∆),
resp. by RepK(GQp,∆)) the category of continuous representations of the proﬁnite group GQp,∆
on ﬁnite dimensional κ-vector spaces (resp. ﬁnitely generated OK-modules, resp. ﬁnite dimen-
sional K-vector spaces). On the other hand, for independent commuting variables Xα (α ∈ ∆)
we put

E∆,κ
OE∆,K := lim
←−

h (cid:0)OK/̟h[[Xα | α ∈ ∆]][X −1

α | α ∈ ∆](cid:1) ,

:= κ[[Xα | α ∈ ∆]][X −1

α | α ∈ ∆] ,

E∆,K := OE∆,K [p−1] .

∼=
Moreover, for each element α ∈ ∆ we have the partial Frobenius ϕα, and group Γα
Gal(Qp(µp∞)/Qp) acting on the variable Xα in the usual way and commuting with the other

variables Xβ (β ∈ ∆\{α}) in the above rings. A (ϕ∆, Γ∆)-module over E∆,κ (resp. over OE∆,K ,
resp. over E∆,K) is a ﬁnitely generated E∆,κ-module (resp. OE∆,K -module, resp. E∆,K-module)
D together with commuting semilinear actions of the operators ϕα and groups Γα (α ∈ ∆). In
case the coeﬃcient ring is E∆,κ or OE∆,K , we say that D is étale if the map id ⊗ϕα : ϕ∗
αD → D
is an isomorphism for all α ∈ ∆. For the coeﬃcient ring E∆,K we require the stronger as-
sumption for the étale property that D comes from an étale (ϕ∆, Γ∆)-module over OE∆,K by
inverting p. The main result of the paper is that Repκ(GQp,∆) (resp. RepOK (GQp,∆), resp.
RepK(GQp,∆)) is equivalent to the category of étale (ϕ∆, Γ∆)-modules over E∆,κ (resp. over
OE∆,K , resp. over E∆,K).

Passing from the Galois side to (ϕ∆, Γ∆)-modules is rather straightforward. One constructs
∆ as an inductive limit of completed tensor products of ﬁnite separable extensions

α of Eα = Fp((Xα)) (α ∈ ∆) over which the action of HQp,∆ = Ker(GQp,∆ ։ Qα∈∆ Γ∆)

partial Frobenii ϕα (α ∈ ∆) using induction, the main step is to ﬁnd a lattice D+∗
α integral in
the variable Xα for some ﬁxed α ∈ ∆ which is an étale (ϕ∆\{α}, Γ∆\{α})-module over the ring
Fp[[Xβ | β ∈ ∆]][X −1
| β ∈ ∆ \ {α}]. This uses the ideas of Colmez [3] constructing lattices
β
D+ and D++ in usual (ϕ, Γ)-modules.

We remark here that Scholze [7] recently realized GQp,∆ (using Drinfeld’s Lemma for dia-
monds) as a geometric fundamental group π1((Spd Qp)|∆|/p.Fr.) of the diamond (Spd Qp)|∆|
modulo the partial Frobenii ϕβ (β ∈ ∆ \ {α}) for some ﬁxed α ∈ ∆: one can endow
E+
∆ = Fp[[Xα | α ∈ ∆]] with its natural compact topology, and look at the subset of its
adic spectrum Spa E+
∆ where all Xα (α ∈ ∆) are invertible. This deﬁnes an analytic adic
space over Fp, whose perfection modulo the action of all Γα’s is a model for (Spd Qp)d. Thus,
after taking the action modulo partial Frobenii ϕβ (β ∈ ∆ \ {α} for some ﬁxed α ∈ ∆), the
fundamental group will be GQp,∆. Now, quite generally étale local systems on diamonds are
equivalent to ϕ-modules. This introduces the last missing Frobenius, and one ends up with
an equivalence between representations of GQp,∆, and some sheaf of modules with Γ∆-action
and commuting actions of ϕα for all α ∈ ∆. However, this will not produce an actual module
over a ring, but a sheaf of modules over a sheaf of rings. One can perhaps deduce the result of
this paper along these lines, but that would require some further nontrivial input (replacing
the above method of ﬁnding a lattice D+∗

α ).

t D := E∆ ⊗E∆,ϕt D → D

for all γα ∈ Γα extending the above formulas to continuous ring endomorphisms of E∆ in the
obvious way. By an étale (ϕ∆, Γ∆)-module over E∆ we mean a (unless otherwise mentioned)
ﬁnitely generated module D over E∆ together with a semilinear action of the (commutative)
αΓα (also denote by ϕt the action of ϕt ∈ T+,∆) such that the maps

monoid T+,∆ :=Qα∈∆ ϕN
are isomorphisms for all elements ϕt ∈ T+,∆. Here we put Γ∆ := Qα∈∆ Γα. We denote by

Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) the category of étale (ϕ∆, Γ∆)-modules over E∆.

The category Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) has the structure of a neutral Tannakian category: For two
objects D1 and D2 the tensor product D1 ⊗E∆ D2 is an étale T+,∆-module with the action
ϕt(d1 ⊗ d2) := ϕt(d1) ⊗ ϕt(d2) for ϕt ∈ T+,∆,, di ∈ Di (i = 1, 2). Moreover, since E∆ is a free

Lemma 2.1. There exists a Γ∆-equivariant injective resolution of E+

∆ as a module over itself.

Proof. Consider the Cousin complex (see IV.2 in [6])

0 → E∆ → E∆,(0) → · · · →

Mp∈Spec(E∆),codim p=r

J(p) → . . .

where J(p) is the injective envelope of the residue ﬁeld κ(p) as a module over the local ring
E∆,p. This is a Γ∆-equivariant injective resolution since the action of Γ∆ on Spec(E∆) respects
the codimension.

Proposition 2.2. Any object D in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) is a projective module over E∆.

Proof. Since E∆ has ﬁnite global dimension, let n be the projective dimension of D. Then by
Lemma 4.1.6 in [9] we have Exti(D, M) = 0 for all i > n and E∆-module M and there exists
an R-module M0 with Extn(D, M0) 6= 0. By the long exact sequence of Ext and choosing an
onto module homomorphism F ։ M0 from a free module F we ﬁnd that Extn(D, F ) 6= 0
whence Extn(D, E∆) 6= 0. However, Extn(D, E∆) is a ﬁnitely generated torsion E∆-module
for n > 0 admitting a semilinear action of Γ∆. Therefore the global annihilator of Extn(D, E∆)
in E∆ is a nonzero Γ∆-invariant ideal in E∆ hence equals E∆ by Lemma 2.1 in [11]. So n = 0
and D is projective.

Lemma 2.3. We have K0(E∆) ∼= Z, ie. any ﬁnitely generated projective module over E∆ is
stably free.

Proof. E+

K0(E+

noting that the map G0(E+
∆) → G0(E∆) is onto by the localization exact sequence of algebraic
K-theory (Thm. II.6.4 in [10]).

∆) ∼= Z (Thm. II.7.8 in [10]). Therefore the localization E∆ = E+

Remark. I am not aware of the analogue of the Theorem of Quillen and Suslin on the
freeness of projective modules over E∆. However, using the equivalence of categories of
Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) with RepFp(GQp,∆) we shall see later on (Cor. 3.16) that any object D in
Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) is in fact free over E∆.

We equip E+

∆ with the X∆-adic topology. Then (E∆, E+

of [7]) if we equip E∆ with the inductive limit topology E∆ =Sn X −n

∆) is a Huber pair (in the sense

complete noetherian Tate ring (op. cit.). Note that this is not the natural compact topology

∆ is not ﬁnite. On the other hand, the inclusion Fp((Xα)) ֒→ E∆ is not continuous
in the X∆-adic topology therefore we cannot apply Drinfeld’s Lemma (Thm. 17.2.4 in [7])
directly in this situation.

∆ would not be open in E∆ since the index of E+

∆ E+

Let D be an object in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆). By Banach’s Theorem for Tate rings (Prop. 6.18 in
[8]), there is a unique E∆-module topology on D that we call the X∆-adic topology. Moreover,
any E∆-module homomorphism is continuous in the X∆-adic topology.

2.2 Integrality properties

Put ϕs := Qα∈∆ ϕα ∈ T+,∆ and deﬁne D++ := {x ∈ D | limk→∞ ϕk

s (x) = 0} where the
limit is considered in the X∆-adic topology (cf. II.2.1 in [3] in case |∆| = 1). Note that ϕs is
the absolute Frobenius on E∆, it takes any element to its pth power.

Since T+∆ is commutative and the action of each ϕt (t ∈ T+,∆) is continuous, D++ is
stable under the action of T+,∆. There is a system of neighbourhoods of 0 in D consisting of

∆-submodules therefore D++ is an E+

∆-submodule.

∆. In particular, there exists an α in ∆ such that valXα(d1) < −r. Since M is open in
D and d ∈ D++, there exists an integer k > 0 such that ϕk

saying that the column vector

In the general case note that D is always stably free by Prop. 2.2 and Lemma 2.3. So
∆ is a free module over E∆ for k large enough. We make D1 into an étale

D+ := {x ∈ D | {ϕk

s (X∆) tends to 0 in the X∆-adic topology, we have X∆D+ ⊆ D++, ie. D+ ⊆ X −1

Since ϕk
∆ D++.
In particular, D+ is ﬁnitely generated over E+
∆. On the other hand, we also have D++ ⊆ D+
by construction whence we deduce D = D+[X −1
∆ ].

Lemma 2.6. We have ϕt(D+) ⊂ D+ (resp. ϕt(D++) ⊂ D++) for all ϕt ∈ T+,∆.

Proof. For any generating system e1, . . . , en of D and any ϕt ∈ T+,∆ there exists an integer
k = k(ϕt, M) > 0 such that we have ϕt(X k
∆ϕt(M) ⊆ M where we put M :=

∆en by Lemma 2.4. Indeed, X∆ divides ϕt(X∆) in E+

E+
∆, and we have D =
M[1/X∆] by construction. The statement on D++ follows from the commutativity of the
monoid T+,∆ noting that there exists a basis of neighbouhoods of 0 in D consisting of E+
∆-
submodules of the form M. To see that ϕt(D+) ⊆ D+ note that ϕt(D+) is bounded and we
have ϕk

s (ϕt(D+)) = ϕt(ϕk

s(D+)) ⊂ ϕt(D+).

Now ﬁx an α ∈ ∆ and deﬁne D+

α := D+[X −1

α is a ﬁnitely generated module over E+

∆\{α}] where for any subset S ⊆ ∆ we put
∆\{α}]. We denote

α := E+

∆[X −1

by T+,α ⊂ T+,∆ the monoid generated by ϕβ (β ∈ ∆ \ {α}) and Γ∆.

XS :=Qβ∈S Xβ. Then D+

Lemma 2.7. D+
∆\{α}d lie in D+ for some
element d ∈ D+, α ∈ ∆, and integers n1, n2 ≥ 0 then we have d ∈ D+. The same statement
holds if we replace D+ by D++.

α /D+ is Xα-torsion free: If both X n1

α d and X n2

s (X n1

α d) = X n1pk

Proof. At ﬁrst assume that D is free as a module over E∆ with basis e1, . . . , en. Then the
denominators of ϕk
s (d) in the basis e1, . . . , en are bounded for k ≥ 0 by
assumption. Therefore the Xβ-valuations of the denominators of ϕk
s(d) are bounded for all
β ∈ ∆ \ {α} since E+
∆ is a unique factorization domain. On the other hand, the Xα-valuations
of these denominators are also bounded since the denominators of ϕk
s(d)
are bounded. To prove the statement we have the same argument but ‘being bounded’ replaced
by ‘tends to 0’.

Finally, by Prop. 2.2 and Lemma 2.3 D ⊕ Ek

the structure of an étale (ϕ, Γ)-module (trivially on Ek
additivity of the constructions D 7→ D+ and D 7→ D+

∆ is free over E∆ and we equip it with
∆). The statement follows from the

α in direct sums.

Lemma 2.8. Assume that D is generated by a single element e1 ∈ D over E∆. Then for any
ϕt in T+,α we have ϕt(e1) = ate1 for some unit at in (E+

α )×.

Proof. Deﬁne at ∈ E∆ and aα ∈ E∆ so that ϕt(e1) = ate1 and ϕα(e1) = aαe1. By the étale
property both at and aα are units in E∆, so it remains to show that valXα(at) = 0. We
compute

ϕα(at)aαe1 = ϕα(at)ϕα(e1) = ϕα(ate1) = ϕα(ϕt(e1)) =
= ϕt(ϕα(e1)) = ϕt(aαe1) = ϕt(aα)ϕt(e1) = ϕt(aα)ate1

whence we deduce

p valXα(at) + valXα(aα) = valXα(ϕα(at)aα) = valXα(ϕt(aα)at) = valXα(aα) + valXα(at) .

This yields valXα(at) = 0 as required.

Lemma 2.9. There exists an integer k = k(D) > 0 such that for any ϕt ∈ T+,α we have

Proof. At ﬁrst assume that D is free, choose a basis e1, . . . , en contained in D+, and put

that D+ ⊆ X −k0
α Mα. Now for a ﬁxed ϕt ∈ T+,α let

lie in
X −(n−1)k0
α by the formula for the inverse matrix using the (n−1)×(n−1) minors in At. Now
note that the elements e1, . . . , en can be written as a linear combination of ϕt(e1), . . . , ϕt(en)

with the Galois group Gal(Qp(µp∞)/Qp) as a quotient of GQp,α via the cyclotomic character

α ∈ ∆ and let GQp,∆ := Qα∈∆ GQp,α. Let RepFp(GQp,∆) be the category of continuous
map GQp,α → Γα and put HQp,∆ := Qα∈∆ HQp,α ⊳ GQp,∆. Putting Eα := Fp((Xα)) we have

the following fundamental result of Fontaine and Wintenberger (Thm. 4.16 [5]).

Theorem 3.9. D is a fully faithful tensor functor from the category RepFp(GQp,∆) to the
category Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆).

Proof. Let f : V1 → V2 be a nonzero morphism in RepFp(GQp,∆). Then the Esep

that D(f ) 6= 0 therefore the faithfulness.

∆ -linear map
∆ ⊗Fp V2 is also nonzero. By the last statement in Prop. 3.7 it follows

∆ ⊗Fp V1 → Esep

Now let V1 and V2 be arbitrary objects in RepFp(GQp,∆) and θ : D(V1) → D(V2) be a
morphism in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆). Then by Prop. 3.7 we obtain a GQp,∆-equivariant Fp-linear

Remark. Note that any étale T+,∆-module D in the image of the functor D is free as a
module over E∆ by construction.

Consider the diagonal embedding diag : GQp ֒→ GQp,∆ sending g ∈ GQp to (g, . . . , g). This

We do this in a way so that the diagonal embedding of GQp ֒→ GQp,∆ acts on the quotient

3.2 The functor V

In order to show that the functor D is essentially surjective, we construct its quasi-inverse
V. Let D be an object in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆). The group GQp,∆ acts on Esep
∆ ⊗E∆ D via the
formula g(λ ⊗ x) := g(λ) ⊗ χcyc(g)(x) (g ∈ GQp,∆, λ ∈ Esep
∆ , x ∈ D) where χcyc : GQp,∆ → Γ∆
is the quotient map. Moreover, each partial Frobenius ϕα (α ∈ ∆) acts semilinearly on
Esep
∆ ⊗E∆ D via the formula ϕα(λ ⊗ x) := ϕα(λ) ⊗ ϕα(x). All these actions commute with
each other by construction. We deﬁne

V(D) := \α∈∆

(Esep

∆ ⊗E∆ D)ϕα=id .

V(D) is a—a priori not necessarily ﬁnite dimensional—representation of GQp,∆ over Fp.

Lemma 3.11. For any integer r > 0 we haveTβ∈∆(Esep

Our main result in this section is the following

Theorem 3.15. The functors D and V are quasi-inverse equivalences of categories between
the Tannakian categories RepFp(GQp,∆) and Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆).

Corollary 3.16. Any object D in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) is a free module over E∆.

Proof. This follows from the essential surjectivity of D using the remark after Thm. 3.9.

Proof of Thm. 3.15. This is a long proof that we divide into 5 steps.

Step 1. Reducing the statement to the essential surjectivity of D. By Thm. 3.9 the functor
D is fully faithful and we have V ◦ D(V ) ∼= V naturally in V for any object V in RepFp(GQp,∆)
by Prop. 3.7. Moreover, by Lemma 3.8 D is compatible with tensor products and duals. So it
remains to show that D is essentially surjective. We proceed by induction on |∆|. For |∆| = 1
this is a classical result of Fontaine (see e.g. Thm. 2.21 in [5]). Suppose that |∆| > 1, ﬁx
α ∈ ∆, and pick an object D in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆).

Step 2. The goal here is to trivialize the ϕβ-action (β ∈ ∆ \ {α}) on D+∗

∆\{α}. By Prop. 2.10 D+∗

r by tensoring up with Esep

Step 4. The goal here is to obtain a (ϕα, Γα)-module Dα over Eα (by trivializing the action
of each ϕβ, β ∈ ∆ \ {α}) which is at the same time a linear representation of the group
GQp,∆\{α}. We take projective limits of the inclusions in Lemma 3.17 with respect to r to
conclude (using Lemma 3.18) that

Note that M[X −1

Dα := \β∈∆\{α}(cid:16)Esep

is contained in the image of the map

Esep+

∆\{α}[[Xα]][X −1

∆\{α}((Xα)) ⊗E∆ D .

On the other hand, by (4) and the third statement of Lemma 3.18 we have an isomorphism

Esep

∆\{α}((Xα)) ⊗Fp((Xα)) Dα

∼→ Esep

∆\{α}((Xα)) ⊗E∆ D .

(7)

Lemma 3.19. The ﬁnite dimensional Fp((Xα))-vector space Dα has the structure of an étale
(ϕα, Γα)-module. At the same time it is a (linear) representation of the group GQp,∆\{α}.
These two actions commute with each other.

17

Proof. The operator ϕα and the groups Γα and GQp,∆\{α} act naturally on Dα. For the
étaleness of the action of ϕα on Dα note that we have Fp((Xα)) ⊗Fp((Xα)),ϕα D ∼= D by the étale
property of ϕα on D and that ϕβ acts trivially on Fp((Xα)). So we compute

Fp((Xα)) ⊗Fp((Xα)),ϕα Dα = Fp((Xα)) ⊗Fp((Xα)),ϕα \β∈∆\{α}(cid:16)Esep
= \β∈∆\{α}(cid:16)Fp((Xα)) ⊗Fp((Xα)),ϕα Esep

Step 5. We show the essential surjectivity of D here. Now we apply VF,α = (Esep

·)ϕα=id on Dα to obtain a ﬁnite dimensional Fp-representation V of GQp,∆. Moreover, we
have dimFp V = dimFp((Xα)) Dα = rkE∆ D by the isomorphism (7) since VF,α is rank-preserving
by Fontaine’s classical result. Using again the isomorphism (7) and the containment Dα ⊂
Esep+

∆\{α}[[Xα]][X −1

Taking GQp,∆-invariants of this inclusion we deduce an inclusion D(V ) ֒→ D using Lemma
3.14. However, this is an isomorphism by Prop. 2.1 in [11] as D(V ) and D have the same
rank.

Remarks.

1. Even though we have constructed V in the proof of the above theorem
by a diﬀerent procedure from just putting V := V(D), we still have an isomorphism
V ∼= V(D(V )) ∼= V(D) by Prop. 3.7.

2. If κ is a ﬁnite extension of Fp, then we have an equivalence of categories between
Repκ(GQp,∆) and Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, κ ⊗Fp E∆). Indeed, we have a natural isomorphism (κ ⊗Fp
∆ ) ⊗κ · ∼= Esep

We will need the following multivariable analogue of Hilbert’s Theorem 90 (additive form).

where ε = ε(α1, . . . , αr, β) is the number of elements in the set {α1, . . . , αr} smaller than β.
Since the operators (id −ϕβ) commute with each other, Φ•(D) is a chain complex of abelian

r(cid:1) | αn ∈ S} is a bijection and by
r−1(cid:1) only the S \ {α}-component of x

contributes to the S component of dr−1(x) for αn ∈ S. So by replacing c with c − dr−1(x) we
may assume without loss of generality that cS = 0 for all S containing αn. In particular, for

The association D 7→ Φ•(D) is an exact functor from the category of abelian groups with

for any short exact sequence 0 → D1 → D2 → D3 → 0, we have a short exact sequence

roots of unity with ε1 6= 1. Note that dEsep is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic

ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension E ′ of E = OE [p−1] contained in ˜B with residue ﬁeld E′ (Prop. 4.20

E∆ := OE∆[p−1] so we have OE∆/(p) ∼= E∆. The Iwasawa algebra O+

4.3 The equivalence of categories

We denote by RepZp(GQp,∆) (resp. by RepQp(GQp,∆)) the category of continuous repres-
entations of GQp,∆ on ﬁnitely generated Zp-modules (resp. on ﬁnite dimensional Qp-vector
spaces). Let T (resp. V ) be an object in RepZp(GQp,∆) (resp. in RepQp(GQp,∆)). We deﬁne

D(T ) :=(cid:16)OdE ur

By Prop. 4.6 D(T ) (resp. D(V )) is a module over OE∆ (resp. over E∆). Moreover, it
admits an action of the monoid T+,∆: the action of ϕα (α ∈ ∆) is trivial on T (resp. on
∆ ) deﬁned above. The action

Proof. This is very similar to the proof of Prop. 2.30 in [5]. We proceed in two steps. Assume
ﬁrst that T is killed by a power ph of p. We use induction on h. The case h = 1 is done
in Prop. 3.7. Now for h > 1 we have a short exact sequence 0 → T1 → T → T2 → 0 of
objects in RepZp(GQp,∆) such that pT1 = 0 and ph−1T2. Since OdE ur
has no p-torsion, it is ﬂat
as Zp-module. Therefore we obtain a short exact sequence

with exact rows. Thus the vertical map in the middle is an isomorphism by induction using
the 5-lemma.

The general case follows from this by taking the projective limit of the isomorphisms above

for T /phT as h tends to inﬁnity.

An étale T+,∆-module over OE∆ is a ﬁnitely generated OE∆-module D together with a

semilinear action of the monoid T+,∆ such that for all ϕt ∈ T+,∆ the map

id ⊗ϕt : ϕ∗

t D := OE∆ ⊗OE∆ ,ϕt D → D

is an isomorphism. We denote by Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, OE∆) the category of étale T+,∆-modules over
OE∆. As in the mod p case, Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, OE∆) has the structure of a neutral Tannakian
category. If D is ﬁnitely generated OE∆ module that is killed by a power ph of p we deﬁne the
i=1 rkE∆ pi−1D/piD where rkE∆ denotes the generic

generic length of D as lengthgenD :=Ph

rank (ie. dimension over Frac(E∆) of the localisation at (0)).

Corollary 4.8. The functor D is exact. D(T ) is an object in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, OE∆) for any T
in RepZp(GQp,∆). Moreover, if T is killed by a power of p then the we have lengthgenD(T ) =
lengthZp T .

Proof. If T is an object in RepZp(GQp,∆) such that phT = 0, then we have H 1(HQp,∆, OdE ur
⊗Zp
T ) = {1} by induction on h using the long exact sequence of continuous HQp,∆-cohomology.
So the exactness of D on ﬁnite length objects in RepZp(GQp,∆) follows the same way as in the
proof of Prop. 4.7 in the special case when pT1 = 0. Now if 0 → T1 → T2 → T3 → 0 is an
arbitrary short exact sequence in RepZp(GQp,∆) then we have an exact sequence

∆

0 → T1[ph] → T2[ph] → T3[ph]

∂h→ T1/phT1 → T2/phT2 → T3/phT3 → 0

of ﬁnite length objects for all h ≥ 1. Applying D yields an exact sequence

0 → D(T1[ph]) → D(T2[ph]) → D(T3[ph]) → D(T1/phT1) → D(T2/phT2) → D(T3/phT3) → 0

for all h ≥ 1. Since Ti is ﬁnitely generated over Zp, we have Ti[ph] = (Ti)tors for h ≥ h0 large
ph·
enough (i = 1, 2, 3). In particular, the connecting map Ti[p(n+1)h]
→ Ti[pnh] is the zero map
for h ≥ h0 and i = 1, 2, 3. Thus the Mittag–Leﬄer property is satisﬁed for both Im(∂h)h and

Coker(∂h)h as the map T1/ph+1T1 → T1/phT1 is surjective for all h ≥ 1. Hence taking the
projective limit we obtain an exact sequence 0 → D(T1) → D(T2) → D(T3) → 0 as claimed.

The statement on the generic length follows from the exactness using Prop. 3.7 and induc-
tion on h such that phT = 0. In particular, D(T ) is ﬁnitely generated over OE∆ if T has ﬁnite
length. Now if T is not necessarily of ﬁnite length then we apply the exactness of D on the
p·
→ T → T /pT → 0 we obtain that D(T /pT ) = D(T )/pD(T )
exact sequence 0 → T [p] → T
which is ﬁnitely generated over E∆. Therefore D(T ) is ﬁnitely generated over OE∆ by the
p-adic completeness of D(T ) (by deﬁnition we have lim
←−h

Finally, the étale property for ﬁnite length modules follows by induction on the length

D(T /phT ) = D(T )).

from the case h = 1 (Prop. 3.7) and in general by taking the projective limit.

Conversely, let D be an object in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, OE∆). We deﬁne

T(D) := \α∈∆(cid:16)OdE ur

D(cid:17)ϕα=id

This is a Zp-module admitting a diagonal action of GQp,∆ via the formula g(λ ⊗ d) := g(λ) ⊗

is an isomorphism.

T(D/phD) by construction. So we deduce

Now note that T(D) is ﬁnitely generated over Zp: this is obvious in the case when phD = 0

Theorem 4.10. The functors D and T are quasi-inverse equivalences of categories between
the Tannakian categories RepZp(GQp,∆) and Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, OE∆).

Finally, an étale T+,∆-module over E∆ is a ﬁnitely generated E∆-module D together with a
semilinear action of the monoid T+,∆ such that there exists an object D0 in Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, OE∆)
with an isomorphism D ∼= D0[p−1] = E∆ ⊗OE∆
D0. We denote by Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) the category
of étale T+,∆-modules over E∆. As before, Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆) has the structure of a neutral Tan-
nakian category. We have the following characteristic 0 version of the category equivalence:

Theorem 4.11. The functors

V 7→ D(V ) :=(cid:16)cE ur
D 7→ V(D) := \α∈∆(cid:16)cE ur

∆ ⊗Qp V(cid:17)HQp,∆
∆ ⊗E∆ D(cid:17)ϕα=id

are quasi-inverse equivalences of categories between the Tannakian categories RepQp(GQp,∆)
and Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, E∆).

Proof. Since GQp,∆ is compact, any ﬁnite dimensional Qp-representation V contains a GQp,∆-
invariant lattice T . The statement follows from Thm. 4.10 by inverting p on both sides. The
compatibility with tensor products and duals follows the same way as in characteristic p.

Remarks.

1. If A is a Zp-algebra which is ﬁnitely generated as a module over Zp, then
we have an equivalence of categories between RepA(GQp,∆) and Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, A ⊗Zp OE∆).

categories between RepK(GQp,∆) and Det(ϕ∆, Γ∆, K ⊗Qp E∆).

2. It is expected that there is a similar equivalence of categories for representations of the
|∆|th direct power of the group Gal(Qp/F ) for a ﬁnite extension F/Qp. However, at
this point it is not clear what type of (ϕ, Γ)-modules one should consider. The usual
cyclotomic (ϕ, Γ)-modules do not seem to be well-suited for the purpose of the p-adic
and mod p Langlands programme. On the other hand, the Lubin–Tate setting may
not work properly in characteristic p due to the non-existence of the distinguished left
inverse ψ of ϕ. To work over the character variety of the group OF [2] seems, however,
to be a good candidate.
