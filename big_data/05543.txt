ON IRRATIONALITY OF SURFACES IN P3

FRANCESCO BASTIANELLI

Abstract. The degree of irrationality irr(X) of a n-dimensional complex projective variety X is
the least degree of a dominant rational map X 99K Pn. It is a well-known fact that given a product
X × Pm or a n-dimensional variety Y dominating X, their degrees of irrationality may be smaller
than the degree of irrationality of X. In this paper, we focus on smooth surfaces S ⊂ P3 of degree
d ≥ 5, and we prove that irr(S × Pm) = irr(S) for any integer m ≥ 0, whereas irr(Y ) < irr(S) occurs
for some Y dominating S if and only if S contains a rational curve.

1. Introduction

In the recent paper [9], Ein, Lazarsfeld and Ullery proposed several important perspectives for
studying measures of irrationality for projective varieties. Along the same lines, we discuss various
birational invariants, which extend the notion of gonality to higher dimensional varieties and, more
importantly, they somehow measure the failure of a given variety to satisfy certain rationality
In particular, we focus on smooth surfaces in P3 of degree d ≥ 5, and we complete
properties.
the characterization of the invariants, depending on the degree d and on the existence of special
subvarieties.

Given a smooth complex projective curve C, the gonality of C is deﬁned as the least integer δ
such that there exists a non-constant morphism C −→ P1 of degree δ, and it is denoted by gon(C).
This is one of the most studied and important invariants in the theory of algebraic curves, and it can
be thought as measuring how the curve C is far from being rational. The most natural extension
of the notion of gonality to higher dimensional varieties is probably the degree of irrationality. For
a smooth complex projective variety X of dimension n, it is deﬁned as

irr(X) := minnδ ∈ N(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∃ a dominant rational map X 99K Pn of degree δo.

Initially, the degree of irrationality was introduced in terms of ﬁeld extensions by Heinzer and Moh,
in order to discuss some generalizations of L¨uroth Theorem (cf. [15, 16]). It is also worth mentioning
a series of papers by Yoshihara, where this invariant was studied especially in the case of surfaces
(see e.g. [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]). We note further that the degree of irrationality equals 1 if and only
if X is a rational variety.

In the case of smooth surfaces in P3, the degree of irrationality is governed by the following (see

[3, Theorem 1.3]).

Theorem 1.1. Let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5. Then irr(S) = d − 2 if and only if
one of the following occurs

(a) S contains a twisted cubic;

(b) S contains a rational curve R of degree r and a line ℓ which is (r − 1)-secant to R.

Otherwise, irr(S) = d − 1.

Moreover, when S ⊂ P3 is a very general surface of degree d ≥ 6, then irr(S) = d − 1, and it
is computed only by projections from points p ∈ S. This fact generalizes a famous result due to
M. Noether on the gonality of plane curves (cf.
[6, 10]), and for any n ≥ 3, it has been recently
extended to very general hypersurfaces X ⊂ Pn+1 of degree d ≥ 2n + 2 (see [9, 4]).

It is worth noting that the degree of irrationality may decrease when we consider a product
X × Pm, or a n-dimensional variety Y dominating X. Namely, it can happen that irr(X × Pm) <
irr(X) and irr(Y ) < irr(X). It is indeed a remarkable established fact the existence of stably rational
and unirational varieties which are not rational (see e.g. [1, 5, 7, 11]). In order to investigate when
this phenomena occur, we consider the invariants

stab. irr(X) := minn irr(X × Pm)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
uni. irr(X) := min(cid:26)irr(Y )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

m ∈ No

∃ a dominant rational map Y 99K X
with dim Y = dim X

(cid:27) ,

and we compare them with irr(X). We note that the conditions uni. irr(X) = 1 and stab. irr(X) = 1
recover the deﬁnitions of stably rational varieties and unirational varieties, respectively. Further-
more, it is easy to check that irr(X) ≥ stab. irr(X) ≥ uni. irr(X) (see Lemma 2.2).

We characterize these invariants on smooth surface in P3, and we achieve the following.

Theorem 1.2. Let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5. Then

(i) stab. irr(S) = irr(S).

(ii) uni. irr(S) = d − 2 if and only if S contains a rational curve. Otherwise, uni. irr(S) = d − 1.

In particular, it follows that irr(X × Pm) cannot drop, and stab. irr(S) is governed by Theorem 1.1.
Furthermore, although unirationality is equivalent to rationality in the case of surfaces, the equality
uni. irr(S) = irr(S) may fail when uni. irr(S) > 1. In particular, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 describe
when this phenomenon occurs for smooth surfaces in P3 (cf. also [3, Remark 4.10]).

To conclude our analysis, we would like to view our result in a more general setting. So we

consider two further invariants, which was introduced in [9]; the covering gonality

and the connecting gonality

cov. gon(X) := min(cid:26)c ∈ N(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
conn. gon(X) := min(cid:26)c ∈ N(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Given a general point x ∈ X, ∃ an irreducible

curve C ⊂ X such that x ∈ C and gon(C) = c (cid:27) ,

Given two general points x, y ∈ X, ∃ an irreducible
curve C ⊂ X such that x, y ∈ C and gon(C) = c

(cid:27) .

Here the curves involved in the deﬁnitions are possibly singular, so gon(C) stands for the gonal-
ity of the normalization of C. Moreover, the conditions cov. gon(X) = 1 and conn. gon(X) = 1
characterize uniruled varieties and rationally connected varieties, respectively.

We point out that all the ﬁve notions we introduced above are birational invariants, and when
X is a curve, each of them does coincide with gonality (cf. Remark 2.1). Furthermore, any such an
invariant may be thought as a measure of the failure of X to satisfy the corresponding rationality
property appearing in the classical chain of implications

rational =⇒ stably rational =⇒ unirational =⇒ rationally connected =⇒ uniruled.

Accordingly, these ‘measures of irrationality’ ﬁt in the sequence of inequalities

irr(X) ≥ stab. irr(X) ≥ uni. irr(X) ≥ conn. gon(X) ≥ cov. gon(X).

Of course, several classical results can be rephrased in terms of these invariants (see e.g.
[17, p.
351] and [8, p. 833] in the case of K3 surfaces), and other classes of varieties can be easily handled,
as in Example 2.3. However, the problem of determining these invariants is in general widely open,
even in the case of surfaces. We suggest for instance [19, Section 3] for some issues concerning the
degree of irrationality and, more generally, [9, Section 4] for a series of very interesting problems on
various measures of irrationality for projective varieties.

Turning to smooth surfaces S ⊂ P3 of degree d, we have that when 1 ≤ d ≤ 3, the surfaces
are rational, so the problem is trivial as all the invariants equal 1. If instead d = 4, the invariants
are completely characterized, except for stab. irr(S), but this is actually the unique case we can not
decide (see Remark 3.3). On the other hand, when S ⊂ P3 is a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5,
Lopez and Pirola proved that the covering gonality is cov. gon(S) = d − 2, and they classiﬁed all
possible families of (d−2)-gonal curves covering S (see [13, Corollary 1.7]). Apart from those families
depending on the existence of rational and elliptic curves on S, every such a surface is covered by
the family of (d − 2)-gonal curves obtained as tangent hyperplane sections, Cp := S ∩ TpS with
p ∈ S. In fact, it is easy to check that this family computes also the connecting gonality, that is
conn. gon(S) = d − 2 (cf. [9, Example 1.7]). Therefore, taking into account Theorems 1.1 and 1.2,
the problem is completely understood, and the picture is summarized by the following.

Theorem 1.3. Let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5. Then

(i) cov. gon(S) = conn. gon(S) = d − 2,

(ii) uni. irr(S) = (cid:26) d − 2 if S contains a rational curve
(iii) stab. irr(S) = irr(S) = (cid:26) d − 2 if either (a) or (b) in Theorem 1.1 occurs

d − 1 otherwise,

d − 1 otherwise.

In particular, when S is assumed to be very general, then cov. gon(S) = conn. gon(S) = d − 2
and uni. irr(S) = conn. gon(S) = irr(S) = d − 1, as S does not contain rational curves (see e.g. [23]).
Besides, in the light of [9, Theorems A and C], it would be interesting to understand the behavior
of those invariants when X ⊂ Pn+1 is a very general hypersurface of large degree and arbitrary
dimension.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 relies mainly on the classiﬁcation of correspondences with null trace
on smooth surfaces in P3, which is described by [13, Theorem 1.3] and is based on Mumford’s
technique of induced diﬀerentials (see [14, Section 2]). In the next section, we thus discuss some
properties of the birational invariants we introduced, and we follow [13] in order to relate them to
correspondences with null trace. Then, Section 3 shall be entirely devoted to prove Theorem 1.2.

2. Preliminaries

Notation. We shall work throughout over the ﬁeld C of complex numbers. By variety we mean a
complete reduced algebraic variety over C, unless otherwise stated. We say that a property holds
for a general point x ∈ X if it holds on an open non-empty subset of X. Analogously, we say that
a property is satisﬁed by a very general point x ∈ X, if the locus of points sharing the property is
the complement of a countable collection of proper subvarieties of X.

2.1. Measures of irrationality. In this subsection, we discuss some elementary properties of the
invariants we deﬁned in the Introduction.

Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n. By composing birational maps X ′ 99K X
and dominant rational maps X 99K Pn, it is trivial to check that the degree of irationality irr(X) is
a birational invariant, and analogously, also stab. irr(X) and uni. irr(X) are.

On the other hand, the covering gonality cov. gon(X) may be equivalently deﬁned as the least
integer c > 0 for which there exist a covering family of c-gonal curves, i.e. a (n − 1)-dimensional

φ

family C
−→ T of curves, endowed with a dominant morphism ϕ : C −→ X, such that the general
ﬁbre Ct := φ−1(t) is an irreducible c-gonal curve mapping birationally onto its image under ϕ.
Similarly, the connecting gonality conn. gon(X) is the least integer c > 0 for which there exist a

−→ T with the properties
connecting family of c-gonal curves, that is a (2n−2)-dimensional family C
above, such that the induced map C ×T C −→ X × X is dominant (cf. for instance [9, Section 1]
and [12, Chapter IV.3]).
In particular, by arguing as in [9, Remark 1.5], we deduce that both
cov. gon(X) and conn. gon(X) are birational invariants.

φ

Remark 2.1. When X is a smooth curve, all the measures of irrationality we are considering do
coincide with gon(X). To see this fact, we recall that given a dominant rational map Z 99K Y
between smooth varieties of the same dimension, its indeterminacy locus can be resolved to a closed
subset of Z of codimension at least two. In particular, any dominant map X 99K P1 is actually
a morphism, and irr(X) = gon(X). The other identities descend instead from the following well-
if C ′ 99K C is a dominant map between curves, then gon(C ′) ≥ gon(C). In order to
known fact:
check that stab. irr(X) = gon(X), consider a morphism f : X −→ P1 computing gon(X), and let
F : X × Pm 99K Pm+1 be a dominant map computing stab. irr(X). Then the map (f × idPm) : X ×
Pm 99K Pm+1 has the same degree of f , and hence stab. irr(X) ≤ gon(X). On the other hand,
given a general line ℓ ⊂ Pm+1, the degree of the map F −1(ℓ) 99K ℓ ∼= P1 is smaller or equal than
the degree of F . Since F −1(ℓ) dominates X under the projection X × Pm 99K X, we conclude that

stab. irr(X) ≥ gon(cid:0)F −1(ℓ)(cid:1) ≥ gon(X). Finally, the remaining invariants, uni. irr(X), conn. gon(X)

and cov. gon(X), are computed by the gonality of curves dominating X, and the minimum is trivially
achieved via idX : X −→ X. Thus they are all equal to the gonality of X.

Along the same lines, we obtain the following elementary result.

Lemma 2.2. Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n. Then

irr(X) ≥ stab. irr(X) ≥ uni. irr(X) ≥ conn. gon(X) ≥ cov. gon(X).

Proof. If F : X 99K Pn is a dominant map computing irr(X), then for any m ∈ N, the map
(F × idPm) : X × Pm 99K Pn+m has the same degree of F . So irr(X) ≥ stab. irr(X).
Besides, given a dominant map X × Pm 99K Pn+m of degree δ, the preimage of a general n-plane
H ⊂ Pn+m is a n-dimensional variety Y admitting a map Y 99K H ∼= Pn of degree δ, and dominating
X under the projection X × Pm −→ X. Therefore stab. irr(X) ≥ uni. irr(X).
Then, let Z be a n-dimensional variety endowed with two ﬁnite maps π : Z 99K X and F : Z 99K Pn,
with deg F = c. Consider two general points z1, z2 ∈ Z, and let ℓ ⊂ Pn be the line through F (z1)
and F (z2). Therefore F −1(ℓ) ⊂ Z is a curve through z1 and z2 admitting a map F −1(ℓ) 99K ℓ ∼= P1
of degree c. Recall that the Grassmannian G(1, n) of lines in Pn has dimension dim G(1, n) = 2n − 2.
Then the preimages under F of the lines of Pn describe a connecting family of c-gonal curves on Z.

Thus the curves π(cid:0)F −1(ℓ)(cid:1) ⊂ X give a connecting family, whose general member has gonality at

ON IRRATIONALITY OF SURFACES IN P3

most c, and hence uni. irr(X) ≥ conn. gon(X).
Finally, the inequality conn. gon(X) ≥ cov. gon(X) is a consequence of the fact that a general
(n − 1)-dimensional subfamily of a connecting family is a covering family.
(cid:3)

Finally, by arguing analogously, one can also compute each invariant in the case of ruled surfaces.

Example 2.3. Let X be a ruled surface. Up to birational equivalence, we assume that X = D × P1,
where D is a smooth curve of genus g ≥ 0. Thus the covering gonality of X is computed by the ruling,
and cov. gon(X) = 1. On the other hand, if C ⊂ X is any irreducible curve connecting two general
points of X, then the ﬁrst projection π1 : D × P1 −→ D restricts to a dominant map π1|C : C −→ D,
and hence conn. gon(X) ≥ gon(D). Furthermore, for any non-constant morphism f : D −→ P1, the
induced map (f × idP1) : D × P1 −→ P1 × P1 has the same degree of f , so that irr(X) ≤ gon(D).
Thus Lemma 2.2 assure that irr(X) = stab. irr(X) = uni. irr(X) = conn. gon(X) = gon(D).

2.2. Correspondences with null trace. In this subsection, we follow [13] in order to recall the
classiﬁcation of correspondences with null trace on smooth surfaces in P3, and their relations with
the measures of irrationality we introduced.

Let X and Y be integral projective surfaces, and assume that X is smooth.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A correspondence of degree k on Y × X is a reduced surface Γ ⊂ Y × X such
that the projections π1 : Γ −→ Y and π2 : Γ −→ X are generically ﬁnite dominant morphisms, with
deg π1 = k. Moreover, we say that two correspondences Γ ⊂ Y × X and Γ′ ⊂ Y ′ × X are equivalent
if there exists a birational map ϕ : Y ′ 99K Y such that Γ′ = (ϕ × idX )−1 (Γ).

Let Γ ⊂ Y × X be a correspondence of degree k, and let U := (cid:8)y ∈ Yreg(cid:12)(cid:12)dim π−1

1 (y) = 0(cid:9). De-
noting by X (k) the k-fold symmetric product of X, we consider the morphism γ : U −→ X (k), which
sends y ∈ U to the 0-cycle γ(y) := x1 + . . . + xk ∈ X (k) such that π−1
1 (y) = {(y, x1), . . . , (y, xk)}.
Given a holomorphic two-form ω ∈ H 2,0(X), [14, Section 1] assures that γ induces canonically a
(2, 0)-form ωγ ∈ H 2,0(U ). Furthermore, it is well-deﬁned the trace map Trγ : H 2,0(X) −→ H 2,0(U )
such that Tr(ω) = ωγ . We refer to [13, Section 2] for details and an explicit local description of the
trace map.

Deﬁnition 2.5. We say that a correspondence Γ ⊂ Y × X has null trace if the associated trace
map Trγ : H 2,0(X) −→ H 2,0(U ) is identically zero.

Remark 2.6. If Y is a smooth surface with H 2,0(Y ) = {0}, the complement Y r U of U can be
assumed to have codimension at least two in Y . Hence H 2,0(U ) = {0}, and any correspondence
Γ ⊂ Y × X has null trace.

Now, let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5. Let G(1, 3) be the Grassmannian of lines
in P3, and for any b ∈ G(1, 3), let ℓb ⊂ P3 denote the corresponding line. Given two integral curves
C1, C2 ⊂ S, we deﬁne three surfaces in G(1, 3) as Sec(C1) := {b ∈ G(1, 3) |ℓb is bisecant to C1 } with
C1 non-degenerate, Sec(C1, C2) := {b ∈ G(1, 3) |ℓb meets both C1 and C2 } with C1 and C2 not lying
on the same plane, and TC1 S := {b ∈ G(1, 3) |ℓb is tangent to S along C1 }. So, we set

ΓC1 := {(b, x) ∈ Sec(C1) × S |x ∈ ℓb and x 6∈ C1 },

ΓC1,C2 := {(b, x) ∈ Sec(C1, C2) × S |x ∈ ℓb, x 6∈ C1 and x 6∈ C2 },

ΓTC1 S := {(b, x) ∈ TC1(S) × S |x ∈ ℓb and x 6∈ C1 },

which are correspondences with null trace of degree d − 2 (cf. [13, Proposition 2.12]). In particular,
we say that C1 (resp. C1 ∪ C2) is the fundamental locus of ΓC1 and ΓTC1 S (resp. ΓC1,C2).

Correspondences with null trace on smooth surfaces in P3 are governed by the following (see

[13, Theorem 1.3] and [3, Theorem 2.5]).

Theorem 2.7. Let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5, and let Γ ⊂ Y × S be a correspon-
dence with null trace of degree k. Then k ≥ d − 2, and equality holds if and only if Γ is equivalent
to (2.1), (2.2), or (2.3).
Moreover, if k ≤ 2d − 7 and π−1
the points x1, . . . , xk ∈ S are collinear.

1 (y) = {(y, x1), . . . , (y, xk)} is the ﬁbre over a general y ∈ Y , then

Finally, the remarks below relate measures of irrationality and correspondences with null trace

(cf. [2, Examples 4.6 and 4.7]).

Remark 2.8. Let F : S 99K P2 be a dominant rational map of degree k. Then the closure of its
graph, Γ := { (y, x) ∈ P2 × S| F (x) = y}, is a correspondence with null trace on P2 × S such that
deg π1 = k and deg π2 = 1. Conversely, any correspondence Γ ⊂ P2 ×S having null trace, deg π1 = k
and deg π2 = 1, is the closure of the graph of some dominant rational map F : S 99K P2 of degree k.
In this terms, Theorem 2.7 implies that irr(S) ≥ d − 2. Furthermore, in the light of Theorem 1.1,
we have that any dominant map F : S 99K P2 of degree d − 2 deﬁnes a correspondence equivalent
either to ΓC1, where C1 ⊂ S is a twisted cubic, or to ΓC1,C2, where C1 is a rational curve of degree
r and C2 is a (r − 1)-secant line of C1.

with null trace on (cid:0)P1 × B(cid:1) × S of degree deg π1 = k, whereas the degree of π2 : Γ −→ S equals the

number of ﬁbers Db passing through a general x ∈ S. Thus Theorem 2.7 gives that k ≥ d − 2. Fur-
thermore, [13, Corollary 1.7] asserts that cov. gon(S) = d − 2, and the possible correspondences in-
duced by the covering families computing cov. gon(S) are equivalent to ΓC1 for some non-degenerate

3. Proofs

In this section, we are aimed at proving Theorem 1.2, and we will show assertions (i) and (ii)

separately. Then, we will also discuss the case of smooth quartic surfaces in P3.

Theorem 3.1. Let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5. Then

uni. irr(S) = (cid:26) d − 2 if S contains a rational curve

d − 1 otherwise.

Proof. To start, we assume that S contains a rational curve R, and we are aimed at constructing a
surface Y dominating S, with irr(Y ) = d − 2. Consider the surface Y ′ := { (x, p) ∈ S × R| x ∈ TpS},
endowed with the dominant projections π1 : Y ′ −→ S and π2 : Y ′ −→ R. For general p ∈ R, let
Cp := S ∩ TpS be the plane curve having a double point at p, and let fp : Cp 99K P1 be the projection

(p) ⊂ Y ′, it is well deﬁned the
from p, so that deg(fp) = d − 2. Under the identiﬁcation Cp
dominant rational map Y ′ 99K P1 × R of degree d − 2 given by (x, p) 7−→ (fp(x), p). Finally, chosen
a desingularization Y

ν−→ Y ′, we have that π1 ◦ ν : Y −→ S is dominant, and

∼= π−1
2

d − 2 ≥ irr(Y ) ≥ uni. irr(S) ≥ cov. gon(S) = d − 2

by Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 2.7. Therefore, irr(Y ) = uni. irr(S) = d − 2.

On the other hand, assume the existence of a surface Y , endowed with two dominant rational
maps φ : Y 99K S and F : Y 99K P2, with deg(F ) = d − 2. Consider the map Y 99K P2 × S sending
y ∈ Y to (F (y), φ(y)), and let Γ ⊂ P2 × S be the closure of its image. Then Γ is a correspondence
on P2 × S, and the ﬁrst projection π1 : Γ −→ P2 satisﬁes deg π1 ≤ deg F = d − 2. Moreover, Γ has
null trace as H 2,0(P2) = {0} (cf. Remark 2.6). Thus Theorem 2.7 assures that deg π1 = d − 2, and
Γ is equivalent to one of the correspondences (2.1), (2.2), (2.3).

If Γ ⊂ P2 × S is equivalent to ΓC1 ⊂ Sec(C1) × S for some non-degenerate curve C1 ⊂ S,
then the surface Sec(C1) ⊂ G(1, 3) of bisecant line to C1 must be rational (see Deﬁnition 2.5).
Moreover, Sec(C1) is birational to the second symmetric product C (2)
1 , via the map sending a
general p1 + p2 ∈ C (2)
to the point b ∈ Sec(C1) parameterizing the line ℓb = hp1, p2i. Therefore we
1
conclude that C1 is rational.

Suppose that Γ ⊂ P2 × S is equivalent to ΓC1,C2 ⊂ Sec(C1, C2) × S, where C1, C2 ⊂ S are
curves not lying on the same plane. Again, there is a birational map associating a general pair
(p1, p2) ∈ C1 × C2 to the point b ∈ Sec(C1, C2) such that ℓb = hp1, p2i. Thus C1 × C2 is rational, and
C1 × C2 is covered by rational curves dominating both C1 and C2 under the natural projections.
Hence both C1 and C2 are rational.

Finally, we assume that Γ ⊂ P2 × S is equivalent to ΓTC1 S ⊂ TC1 S × S for some curve C1 ⊂ S,
so that TC1 S is rational. Since S ⊂ P3 is a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5, for the general b ∈ TC1 S,
there exists a unique point p ∈ C1 such that the line ℓb lies on TpS and passes through p.
It
follows that the incidence variety I := { (p, b) ∈ C1 × TC1 S| p ∈ ℓb ⊂ TpS} is birational to TC1 S via
the second projection. Thus I is covered by rational curves, which dominate C1 under the ﬁrst
projection I −→ C1, and hence C1 is rational.

Therefore, we conclude that if uni. irr(S) = d − 2, then S contains a rational curve C1.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.2. Let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d ≥ 5. Then

stab. irr(S) = irr(S).

Proof. If stab. irr(S) = d − 1, then Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 1.1 assure that irr(S) = d − 1, as well.
On the other hand, let m be a ﬁxed positive integer, and let Φ : S × Pm 99K Pm+2 be a dominant
rational map such that deg Φ = stab. irr(S) = d − 2. Notice that for a general 2-plane H ⊂ Pm+2,
the preimage W := Φ−1(H) is a surface dominating S and having irr(W ) = d − 2. Fix a m-plane
Π ⊂ Pm+2, so that the general 2-plane H ⊂ Pm+2 meets Π at a single point z ∈ H. The preimages
of lines ℓ ⊂ H passing through z give a one-dimensional family of (d − 2)-gonal curves Φ−1(ℓ) ⊂ W ,

and the projection Ψ : S × Pm −→ S induces a covering family of (d − 2)-gonal curves Ψ(cid:0)Φ−1(ℓ)(cid:1)

on S. Thus Remark 2.9 assures that there exists some correspondence ΓH ⊂ YH × S having null
trace and degree d − 2. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, ΓH is equivalent to one of the
correspondences ΓC1, ΓC1,C2, and ΓTC1 S, where the components C1, C2 ⊂ S of the fundamental loci
are suitable rational curves.

FRANCESCO BASTIANELLI

The 2-planes H ⊂ Pm+2 intersecting the m-plane Π ⊂ Pm+2 properly, describe an open subset
V ⊂ G(2, m + 2). Moreover, since the rational curves on S are at most countably many, so are the
possible fundamental loci of the correspondences of type (2.1), (2.2), (2.3) equivalent to the surfaces
ΓH. Thus there exists an open subset U ⊂ V such that for all planes H parameterized over U ,
the correspondences ΓH are equivalent to a ﬁxed correspondence Γ ⊂ Y × S of type (2.1), (2.2), or
(2.3). In particular, Y is a rational surface coinciding with Sec(C1), Sec(C1, C2), or TC1 S, for some
ﬁxed fundamental locus C ⊂ S, where C is either a rational integral curve C1 ⊂ S, or the union of
two integral rational curves C1, C2 ⊂ S. As usual, we denote by π1 : Γ −→ Y and π2 : Γ −→ S the
natural projections, where deg π1 = d − 2.

Now,

let (x, w) ∈ S × Pm be a general point, so that its image q := Φ(x, w) ∈ Pm+2
By construction,
lies in the open set described by the planes parameterized over U .
the ﬁbre Φ−1(q) = {(x, w), (x2, w2), . . . , (xd−2, wd−2)} corresponds to some ﬁbre π−1
1 (y) =
{(y, x), (y, x2), . . . , (y, xd−2)} ⊂ Γ. Thanks to Theorem 2.7, the points x, x2, . . . , xd−2 ∈ S lie on a
line ℓy ⊂ P3, which is parameterized by y ∈ Y . Therefore we obtain a diagram

2 (x) = {(y, x), (y2, x), . . . , (ys, x)} ⊂ Γ, where s := deg π2. Since π−1

where f : S × Pm 99K Γ is the dominant rational map such that f (x, w) = (y, x). Then we consider
the ﬁbre π−1
2 (x) is a ﬁnite set,
it follows that the restriction f|{x}×Pm is a constant map, i.e. f (x, t) = (y, x) for general t ∈ Pm.
Therefore, for such a general t ∈ Pm, the composition of f|S×{t} : S × {t} 99K Γ and π1 : Γ −→ Y
gives a dominant rational map F : S 99K Y of degree d − 2. Recalling that Y is rational, we conclude
that irr(S) = d − 2 = stab. irr(S).
(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. Let S ⊂ P3 be a smooth surface of degree d = 4, so that S is a K3 surface of genus 3
embedded by its polarization. Then the various measures of irrationality of S satisfy

(i) cov. gon(S) = conn. gon(S) = uni. irr(S) = 2;

(ii) 2 ≤ stab. irr(S) ≤ 3;

(iii) irr(S) = (cid:26) 2 if S contains a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus g ≥ 2

3 otherwise.

Notice that assertion (ii) is a consequence of (i), (iii) and Lemma 2.2. On the other hand,
Bogomolow-Mumford Theorem [17, p. 351] assures that S contains at most countably many rational
curves, and it is covered by singular elliptic curves. Hence cov. gon(S) = 2. Moreover, by arguing as
in the proof of Theorem 3.1, the existence of a rational curve on S guarantees that uni. irr(S) ≤ 2.
Thus assertion (i) follows from Lemma 2.2. Finally, we note that the projection from any point
p ∈ S is a map S 99K P2 of degree 3, so that irr(S) ≤ 3. Therefore assertion (iii) holds as irr(S) = 2
if and only if S contains a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus g ≥ 2, by Enriques-Campedelli
Theorem [8, p. 833].

I am grateful to Gian Pietro Pirola, as most of the results included in this paper was obtained
through fruitful conversations with him. This note is part of an introductory talk I gave during the
