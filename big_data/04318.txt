ON THE BRAUER-PICARD GROUPS OF FUSION CATEGORIES

IAN MARSHALL AND DMITRI NIKSHYCH

Abstract. We develop methods of computation of the Brauer-Picard groups
of fusion categories and apply them to compute such groups for several classes
of fusion categories of prime power dimension: representation categories of
elementary abelian groups with twisted associativity, extra special p-groups,
and the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra. We conclude that many ﬁnite groups of
Lie type occur as composition factors of the Brauer-Picard groups of pointed
fusion categories.

1. Introduction

Let A be a fusion category. The Brauer-Picard group BrPic(A) was introduced
in [ENO1] as the group of equivalence classes of invertible A-bimodule categories.
The motivation for this deﬁnition is that given a ﬁnite group G and a G-graded
fusion category B = ⊕g∈G Bg whose trivial component B1 is equivalent to A there
is a group homomorphism

(1)

G → BrPic(A)

and, conversely, any such B can be constructed from a homomorphism (1) and
some cohomological data. It was also shown in [ENO1] that there is a canonical
isomorphism

BrPic(A) ∼= Autbr(Z(A)),

(2)
where Autbr(Z(A)) is the group of isomorphism classes of braided tensor autoequiv-
alences of the center Z(A) of A. The latter group can be thought of as a categorical
analogue of an orthogonal group. For example, if A is the representation category

its canonical quadratic form.

of a ﬁnite Abelian group A, one has Autbr(Z(A)) ∼= O(A⊕bA), where bA is the group
of characters of A and O(A ⊕bA) is the group of automorphisms of A ⊕bA preserving

The deﬁnition of BrPic(A) is rather abstract, while the group Autbr(Z(A)) is de-
ﬁned in more concrete terms and, hence, is easier to compute. There is also an im-
portant geometric intuition coming from the action of Autbr(Z(A)) on Lagrangian
subcategories of the center (these are categorical counterparts of Lagrangian sub-
spaces). Such actions were used in [BN, NR, R] to compute Brauer-Picard groups
of various symmetric tensor categories. An analogue of the Bruhat decomposition
of BrPic(Rep(G)), where G is a ﬁnite group, was recently discussed in [LP].

Let p be a prime. By a fusion p-category we mean a fusion category whose
Frobenius-Perron dimension is a power of p. For odd p such a category is always
integral, i.e., is equivalent to the representation category of some semisimple quasi-
Hopf algebra [GN], while for p = 2 it is a Z2-extension of an integral fusion category.
Fusion p-categories were classiﬁed in [DGNO1] (see also [EGNO, Section 9.14]).
Namely, it was shown that any integral fusion p-category A is group-theoretical,

i.e., it is categorically Morita equivalent to a pointed fusion category. Explicitly,
this means that A is equivalent to the category of bimodules over an algebra in
the category C(G, ω) of vector spaces graded by a p-group G with the associativity
constraint given by ω ∈ H 3(G, k×). Thus, all fusion p-categories can be described
in terms of p-groups and their cohomology.

In this paper we develop methods of computing the group BrPic(A), where A is

a fusion category, using the induction homomorphism

(3)

ind : Aut(A) → Autbr(Z(A)) ∼= BrPic(A)

from the group of tensor autoequivalences of A to the group of braided autoe-
quivalences of its center, see Section 3 for a precise deﬁnition. The image of this
homomorphism is a subgroup of BrPic(A) which may or may not coincide with the
If ˜A is a fusion category categorically Morita equivalent to A (so
whole group.
that BrPic(A) ∼= Autbr(Z( ˜A)) then one can also induce central autoequivalences
of Z(A) from ˜A. Thus, in general, there are several induction homomorphisms
that can be combined to compute the Brauer-Picard group. Another useful tool
of constructing elements of the Brauer-Picard group is the Picard induction of an
invertible Z(A)-module category (i.e., a A-bimodule category) from an invertible
category category over a subcategory D ⊂ Z(A).

We use these methods to begin a systematic study of Brauer-Picard groups of
fusion p-categories. These groups turn out to be rather large and interesting. In
particular, they include extensions of many classical ﬁnite groups of Lie type. Since
the Brauer-Picard group is invariant under categorical Morita equivalence, it suﬃces
to compute the Brauer-Picar groups of categories A = C(G, ω), where G is a p-
group. We explicitly compute these groups in the cases when G is an elementary
Abelian or extra special p-group. We also compute the Brauer-Picard group of the
representation category of the celebrated Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra [KP].

The paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we recall deﬁnitions and basic facts about Brauer-Picard groups and

tensor autoequivalences of fusion categories.

In Section 3 we study the induction homomorphism (3). Proposition 3.1 gives
an exact sequence that can be used to compute the kernel of ind. We characterize
the image of induction in Theorem 3.3 as the stabilizer of a certain Lagrangian
algebra in the center. The orbits of the action of the Brauer-Picard group on the
categorical Lagrangian Grassmannian are described in Section 3.4.

In Section 4 we prove several results about the structure of representation cate-
gories of twisted quantum doubles (i.e., categories Z(C(G, ω))). In particular, we
analyze the image of the above induction homomorphism in this case and give a
suﬃcient conditions for it to be surjective (Corollary 4.7). We also note a useful
braided equivalence (30) that allows to replace the group G by an easier group.

In Section 5 for an elementary abelian p-group V we describe the cohomol-
ogy group H 3(V, k×) as a GL(V )-module and obtain exact sequences containing
the Brauer-Picard groups of categories C(V, ω). We show that under certain non-
degeneracy conditions these Brauer-Picard groups are abelian extensions of stabi-
lizers of certain elements in exterior and symmetric algebras of V ∗.

Finally, in Section 6 we compute of Brauer-Picard groups of several classes of
fusion p-categories: representation categories of extra special p-groups, pointed

fusion categories coming from simple modular Lie algebras, and the representation
category of the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra of dimension 8.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Fusion categories and Brauer-Picard groups. In this paper we work over
an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic 0. By a fusion category we mean a
semisimple rigid tensor category with ﬁnitely many isomorphism classes of simple
objects and ﬁnite dimensional spaces of morphisms. For basic results of the theory
of fusion categories see [EGNO, DGNO2].

For a fusion category A let Aut(A) denote the group of isomorphism classes of
tensor autoequivalences of A. If A is a braided fusion category we denote Autbr(A)
the group of isomorphism classes of braided tensor autoequivalences of A.

For a group G let Aut(G) denote the group of automorphisms of G, let Inn(G)
denote the subgroup of inner automorphisms, and let Out(G) = Aut(G)/ Inn(G) be
the group of (classes of) outer automorphisms of G.

A fusion category is called pointed if all its simple objects are invertible with
respect to the tensor product. For a fusion category A let Apt denote its maximal
pointed fusion subcategory, i.e., the fusion subcategory generated by invertible
simple objects of A.

Any pointed fusion category is equivalent to some category C(G, ω) of vector
spaces graded by a ﬁnite group G with the associativity constraint given by a 3-
cocycle ω ∈ H 3(G, k×). The center Z(C(G, ω)) is known to be equivalent to the
representation category of the twisted group double, i.e., the quasi-Hopf algebra
Dω(G).

Remark 2.1. A common notation for C(G, ω) in the literature is Vecω
a diﬀerent notation in order to keep subscripts reasonable.

G. We choose

The Brauer-Picard group BrPic(A) of a fusion category A consists of equivalence
classes of invertible A-bimodule categories [ENO1] with multiplication given by the
tensor product over A. It was shown in [ENO1, ENO2] that there is a canonical
isomorphism

(4)

Φ : BrPic(A) ∼−→ Autbr(Z(A)),

where Z(A) denotes the center of A.

More generally, for a braided fusion category C the Picard group of C consists
of equivalence classes of one-sided C-module categories. When C is non-degenerate,
there is an isomorphism

(5)
Note that (4) is a special case of (5) since Pic(Z(A)) ∼= BrPic(A).

Φ : Pic(C) ∼−→ Autbr(C).

Isomorphism (4) was used in [NR] to analyze Brauer-Picard groups of categories

C(G, 1) = VecG and compute them in concrete examples.

2.2. Fusion p-categories. Let p be a prime integer. By a fusion p-category we
mean a fusion category whose Frobenius-Perron dimension is pn for some integer n.
Such categories were characterized in [DGNO1] (see also [EGNO, Section 9.4]).
Namely, any such category A which is integral (i.e., such that every object of A has
an integral Frobenius-Perron dimension) is group-theoretical, i.e., there is a p-group
G and ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) such that A is categorically Morita equivalent to C(G, ω).
In particular,

BrPic(A) ∼= BrPic(C(G, ω)).

Remark 2.2. When p is odd, a fusion p-category is automatically integral.

Computations of Brauer-Picard groups of concrete “small” examples of fusion

p-categories were given in [NR]. In particular, it was shown that

(6)

BrPic(C(D, 1)) = S4,

BrPic(C(Q, 1)) = S3,

where D and Q are, respectively, the dihedral and quaternion groups of order 8 and
Sn denotes the symmetric group of degree n.

Furthermore, it was shown in [R], that if G is the (unique) non-Abelian group

of order p3 and exponent p, where p is odd, then

(7)

BrPic(C(G, 1)) = SL3(Fp).

2.3. Tensor autoequivalences of pointed fusion categories. Let G be a ﬁnite
group and let ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) be a 3-cocycle.

Let Stab(ω) ⊂ Aut(G) be the subgroup of automorphisms a ∈ Aut(G) such that
ω ◦ (a × a × a) and ω are cohomologous. Note that Inn(G) ⊂ Stab(ω). The following
result is well known (and is easy to check).

Proposition 2.3. There is a short exact sequence

(8)

0 → H 2(G, k×) → Aut(C(G, ω)) → Stab(ω) → 0.

Here H 2(G, k×) parameterizes the tensor functor structures on the identity end-

ofunctor of C(G, ω). Given a ∈ Stab(ω) and a 2-coboundary µ such that

d2(µ) =

ω ◦ (a × a × a)

ω

let Fa,µ denote the corresponding autoequivalence of C(G, ω).

2.4. Lagrangian subcategories. Let C be a non-degenerate braided fusion cat-
egory. A fusion subcategory L ⊂ C is called Lagrangian if L is Tannakian, i.e.,
L = Rep(G) for some ﬁnite group G, and L coincides with its M¨uger centralizer,
i.e., L = L′.
In this case the regular algebra A = Fun(G) of Rep(G) is a La-
grangian algebra in C (see Section 3.3) and the category CA of left A-modules in C
is equivalent to C(G, ω) for some ω ∈ H 3(G, k×), so that there is a braided tensor
equivalence

(9)

C ∼= Z(C(G, ω)).

See [DGNO2, Section 4.4.10] for details.

2.5. Properties of the Picard induction. Let C be a braided fusion category
and let D ⊂ C be a fusion subcategory. There is a homomorphism of Picard groups
given by the induction:

(10)

P C

D : Pic(D) → Pic(C) : M 7→ C ⊠D M.

We will call this homomorphism the Picard induction. A diﬀerent kind of induction
(of central autoequivalences) will be considered in Section 3.

The kernel of P C

D was described in [BN, Proposition 3.11]. Namely, let

C =Mα∈Σ

Cα

be the decomposition of C into a direct sum of D-module subcategories. Then

(11)

Ker (P C

D) = {Cα, α ∈ Σ | Cα is an invertible D-module category}.

3. Induction of central autoequivalences

3.1. Induction Aut(A) → Autbr(Z(A)). Let A be a fusion category. Recall that
the objects of the center Z(A) of A are pairs (Z, γ), where Z is an object of A and
γ = {γX : X ⊗ Z → Z ⊗ X} is a natural isomorphism satisfying certain coherence
axioms, see, e.g., [EGNO, 7.13]. The fusion category Z(A) has a canonical braiding
and there is an induction homomorphism

(12)

ind : Aut(A) → Autbr(Z(A)) : α 7→ ind(α),

where ind(α)(Z, γ) = (α(Z), γα) and γα is deﬁned by the following commutative
diagram

(13)

X ⊗ α(Z)

γ α
X

α(Z) ⊗ X

α(α−1(X)) ⊗ α(Z)

α(Z) ⊗ α(α−1(X))

Jα−1(X),Z

JZ,α−1(X)

α(α−1(X) ⊗ Z)

α(γα−1(X))

/ α(Z ⊗ α−1(X)).

Here α−1 is a quasi-inverse of α and JX,Y : α(X) ⊗ α(Z) ∼−→ α(X ⊗ Z) is the tensor
functor structure of α.

3.2. The kernel of induction. Let us recall several canonical homomorphisms
associated to a fusion category A.

Let U (A) denote the universal grading group of A and let U (A)ab denote the
maximal abelian quotient of U (A). The objects Z in Z(A) such that Z = 1 as
an object of A form an Abelian group isomorphic to \U (A)ab (i.e., the group of
characters of U (A)ab), see [GN].
Indeed, central object structures on 1 are in
bijection with tensor automorphisms of the identity endofunctor of A. This yields
an injective homomorphism

(14)

\U (A)ab → Inv(Z(A)).

Next, the forgetful functor F : Z(A) → A restricts to a homomorphism between

groups of invertible objects:

(15)

F : Inv(Z(A)) → Inv(A).

For any invertible object X ∈ A the conjugation by X is a tensor autoequivalence

of C, thus there is a group homomorphism

(16)

conj : Inv(A) → Aut(A).

Proposition 3.1. The sequence of group homomorphisms
(17)

0

/ \U (A)ab

/ Inv(Z(A)) F

/ Inv(A)

conj

/ Aut(A)

ind /

/ Autbr (Z(A))

is exact.

Proof. The exactness at Inv(Z(A)) is obvious. To see that the sequence is exact at
Inv(A) observe that a natural tensor isomorphism between the conjugation functor

V 7→ X ⊗ V ⊗ X ∗

and idA is the same thing as a central structure on X.
It remains to establish
exactness at Aut(A). For α ∈ Aut(A) let Aα denote the invertible A-bimodule cat-
egory corresponding to the induced autoequivalence ind(α) ∈ Autbr (Z(A)) under
isomorphism (4). This category is equivalent to the regular category A as a right
A-module category and left action of A on Aα is given by

(18)

(X, V ) 7→ α(X) ⊗ V,

for all X ∈ A and V ∈ Aα, see [NR, Example 6.4]. Braided autoequivalence ind(α)
is trivial if and only if there is an A-bimodule equivalence between Aα and A. Such
an equivalence is given by V 7→ X ⊗ V for an invertible object X in A such that α
is the conjugation by X. Thus, the result follows from isomorphism (4).
(cid:3)

Remark 3.2. The exact sequence (17) can also be obtained by combining two
exact sequences from [GP, Theorem 1.3].

3.3. The image of induction. Let C be a non-degenerate braided fusion category
and let A be a Lagrangian algebra in C. By deﬁnition [DMNO], this means that
A is a connected ´etale (i.e., commutative and separable) algebra in C such that
FPdim(A)2 = FPdim(C). Let CA be the category of left A-modules in C. It is a
fusion category with tensor product ⊗A.

There is a canonical braided tensor equivalence

(19)

Let

(20)

ιA : C ∼−→ Z(CA) : Z 7→ A ⊗ Z.

indA : Aut(CA) → Autbr(Z(CA))

denote the induction homomorphism.

Theorem 3.3. Let α be a braided tensor autoequivalence of C. The following
condition are equivalent:

(i) there is an algebra isomorphism α(A) ∼= A,
(ii) there is γ ∈ Aut(CA) such that α = ι−1

A ◦ indA(γ) ◦ ιA.

Proof. Suppose that there is an algebra isomorphism φ : α(A) ∼−→ A. Deﬁne an
autoequivalence γ ∈ Aut(CA) as follows. Given an A-module X in C with the action
p : A ⊗ X → X we set γ(X) = α(X) as an object in C, with the action

A ⊗ γ(X) = A ⊗ α(X)

φ⊗idα(X)
−−−−−−→ α(A) ⊗ α(X) ∼= α(A ⊗ X)

α(p)
−−−→ α(X).

Then ιAαι−1
is determined by that of Z. This means that ιA ◦ α ◦ ι−1

A (A⊗ Z) ∼= A⊗ α(Z) = γ(A⊗ Z) as A-modules and its central structure

A = indA(γ).

Conversely, suppose that α = ι−1

A ◦ indA(γ) ◦ ιA for some γ ∈ Aut(CA). Let
FA : Z(CA) → CA be the forgetful functor and let IA : CA → Z(CA) be its right
adjoint. Note that IA(1) is a Lagrangian algebra in Z(CA) and A ∼= ι−1
A (IA(1)).
For any γ ∈ Aut(CA) we have a natural tensor isomorphism

(21)

FA ◦ ind(γ) ∼= γ ◦ FA.

Taking adjoints of both sides and replacing γ by its inverse we obtain natural
isomorphism ind(γ) ◦ IA ∼= IA ◦ γ satisfying a multiplicative property corresponding
to (21) being an isomorphism of tensor functors. Applying both sides of the last
isomorphism to 1 we obtain an algebra isomorphism
ind(γ) (IA(1)) ∼= IA(1),

which is equivalent to α(A) ∼= A.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.4. It follows from Theorem 3.3 that the image of the induction homo-
morphism (20) is the stabilizer of (the isomorphism class of) a Lagrangian algebra
A ∈ C in Autbr(C).

3.4. Orbits of the action of the Brauer-Picard group on the categorical
Lagrangian Grassmannian. Let A be a fusion category. Denote by L(A) the
groupoid of Lagrangian algebras in Z(A). It is known that L(A) is equivalent to
the groupoid of indecomposable A-module categories via A 7→ Z(A)A. The group
Autbr(Z(A)) (i.e., the Brauer-Picard group of A) acts on L(A) in an obvious way.

Remark 3.5. The groupoid L(A) can be thought of as a categorical analogue of
a Lagrangian Grassmannian. In [NR] the action of Autbr(Z(A)) on the subset of
L(A) consisting of algebras coming from Lagrangian subcategories of Z(A) was
considered.

The following result extends Theorem 3.3 from the previous section.

Proposition 3.6. Let A and B be Lagrangian algebras in Z(A). There exists a
tensor equivalence Z(A)A ∼= Z(A)B if and only if there exists α ∈ Autbr(Z(A))
such that α(A) ∼= B as algebras in Z(A).
Proof. Suppose there is a tensor equivalence φ : Z(A)A → Z(A)B. Let ind(φ) :
Z(Z(A)A) → Z(Z(A)B) be the induced braided tensor equivalence and let

ιA : Z(Z(A)A) → Z(A),

ιB : Z(Z(A)B) → Z(A)

be braided equivalences deﬁned in the previous section. Then α = ι−1
B ◦ ind(φ) ◦ ιA
is a braided autoequivalence of Z(A) that maps A to B (the veriﬁcation of this fact
is completely parallel to one in the proof of Theorem 3.3).

Conversely, if α ∈ Autbr(Z(A)) then there is a tensor equivalence

Z(A)A ∼= Z(A)α(A)

given by X 7→ α(X) for all objects X ∈ Z(A)A.

(cid:3)

IAN MARSHALL AND DMITRI NIKSHYCH

Remark 3.7. Proposition 3.6 implies that orbits of the action of Autbr(Z(A)) on
the set of isomorphism classes of Lagrangian algebras in Z(A) are parameterized
by equivalence classes of fusion categories categorically Morita equivalent to A.

Equivalently, we have a parameterization of orbits of the action of BrPic(A) on
the set of equivalence classes of indecomposable left A-module categories. Namely,
two A-module categories belong to the same orbit if and only if the corresponding
dual fusion categories are equivalent. A related result is established by Galindo and
Plavnik in [GP, Theorem 1.4].

4. Representation categories of twisted group doubles

Let G be a ﬁnite group and let ω ∈ H 3(G, k×).

4.1. Invertible objects of the center of a pointed fusion category. Let Z(G)
denote the center of G. For any a ∈ Z(G) let

(22)

βa(x, y) =

ω(a, x, y)ω(x, y, a)

ω(x, a, y)

,

x, y ∈ G.

It is known that βa is a 2-cocycle and that the map

(23)

β : Z(G) → H 2(G, k×) : a 7→ βa

is a group homomorphism.

Let Gab denote the maximal abelian quotient of G, i.e., Gab = G/[G, G].
The invertible objects of Z(C(G, ω)) are well known, see, e.g., [DPR]. The exact
sequence (24) in the next proposition can be found in [GP, Example 6.2]. We
include its proof for the sake of completeness.

Proposition 4.1. The following sequence

(24)

is exact. Here F is given by the forgetful functor.

0 →dGab → Inv(Z(C(G, ω)) F−→ Z(G)

β
−→ H 2(G, k×)

Proof. The central structures on the identity object of C(G, ω) are parameterized

by linear characters of G, i.e., by dGab. It is clear that in order to have a central

structure the invertible object of C(G, ω) must correspond to an element of Z(G).
Finally, it follows from (22) that a ∈ Z(G) admits a central structure if and only if
βa is a coboundary.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.2. Proposition 4.1 can also be derived from the exact sequence (17).

Corollary 4.3. The category Z(C(G, ω)) is pointed if and only if G is Abelian and
β is zero.

Corollary 4.4. Suppose that G is Abelian. Then Z(C(G, ω))pt is Lagrangian if
and only if β is injective.

Proof. Note that Z(C(G, ω))pt contains the Lagrangian subcategory L = Rep(G)
consisting of central objects supported on 1. Clearly, Z(C(G, ω))pt = L if and only
if the forgetful homomorphism F : Inv(Z(C)) → Inv(C) is trivial, i.e., if and only if
β is injective.

4.2. Image of induction in the pointed case. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let
ω ∈ H 3(G, k×).

Let OutStab(ω) = Stab(ω)/ Inn(G) denote the subgroup of Out(G) consisting of

classes of automorphisms a such that ω ◦ (a × a × a) is cohomologous to ω.

Let I(G, ω) be the image of induction Aut(C(G, ω)) → Autbr(Z(C(G, ω))).

Proposition 4.5. There is an exact sequence

(25)

Z(G)

β

−→ H 2(G, k×) ind−−→ I(G, ω) → OutStab(ω) → 0

Proof. Using the exact sequence (17) we see that

I(G, ω) ∼= Aut(C(G, ω))/Ker(ind) ∼= Aut(C(G, ω))/Im(conj),

where conj is given by (16). The image of conj in Aut(C(G, ω)) is generated by
Inn(G) = G/Z(G) and the image of β : Z(G) → H 2(G, k×) ⊂ Aut(C(G, ω)) deﬁned
in (23) (note that the conjugation by a ∈ Z(G) gives rise to a non-trivial tensor
autoequivalence of C(G, ω) precisely when βa is non-trivial in H 2(G, k×)). By (8),
this implies the statement.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.6. We have an exact sequence
(26)

0 → dGab → Inv(Z(C(G, ω)) F−→ Z(G)

Corollary 4.7. Let C be a non-degenerate braided fusion category and let L =
Rep(G) be a Lagrangian subcategory of C such that α(L) = L for every α ∈ Autbr(C).
Then C ∼= Z(C(G, ω)) for some ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) and the induction homomorphism

β

−→ H 2(G, k×) ind−−→ I(G, ω) → OutStab(ω) → 0.

(27)

Aut(C(G, ω)) → Autbr(Z(C(G, ω))

is surjective, i.e., Autbr(Z(C(G, ω)) = I(G, ω).

Proof. This follows from Theorem 3.3 and Proposition 4.5.

(cid:3)

4.3. Braided equivalences between representation categories of twisted
group doubles. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let A ⊂ G be a normal Abelian
subgroup. Let K := G/A be the quotient group, so that there is an extension

(28)

0 → A → G → K → 0.

Such an extension is determined up to an isomorphism by the action of K on G
(denoted by (x, a) 7→ x·a for x ∈ K, a ∈ A) and the cohomology class of a 2-cocycle
κ ∈ Z 2(K, A), so that elements of G are identiﬁed with pairs (a, x) ∈ A × K and
the multiplication is given by

(a, x) (b, y) = (a(x · b)κ(x, y), xy),

a, b ∈ A, x, y ∈ K.

It was shown in [MN, N] that the fusion category VecG is categorically Morita
equivalent to Vecω

bA⋊K, where bA is the dual of the K-module A and the 3-cocycle

ω((ρ1, x1), (ρ2, x2), (ρ3, x3)) = ρ1(κ(x2, x3)),

(29)

ω ∈ Z 3(bA ⋊ K, k×) is deﬁned by
for all ρ1, ρ2, ρ3 ∈ bA and x1, x2, x3 ∈ K.

10

IAN MARSHALL AND DMITRI NIKSHYCH

Remark 4.8. In fact, in [MN, N, U] all pairs of Morita equivalent pointed fusion
categories (i.e., all pairs of of twisted group doubles with braided tensor equivalent
representation categories) were classiﬁed. In this paper we will only use the special
case described above.

Thus, there exists a braided equivalence

(30)

Z(VecG) ∼= Z(Vecω

bA⋊K).

So for computational purposes the double of G can be replaced by the twisted double

of an easier group bA ⋊ K.

Let p be a prime, let n be a positive integer, and let Vn denote the elementary
Abelian p-group of order pn. We have Aut(Vn) = GLn(Fp). Below we will also
view Vn as an n-dimensional vector space over the ﬁeld Fp with p elements. We
will denote V ∗

n = Hom(Vn, Fp) the dual vector space.

As before, for ω ∈ H 3(Vn, k×) we denote C(Vn, ω) the category of Vn-graded

vector spaces with the associativity constraint twisted by ω.

For a vector space W we denote

^(W ) =

∞Mi=0 ^i

(W ) and

S(W ) =

Si(W )

∞Mi=0

the alternating and symmetric algebras of W . When W has a basis {w1, . . . , wn}

we also writeV(W ) =V(w1, . . . , wn) and S(W ) = S(w1, . . . , wn).

5.1. The Brauer-Picard group of C(Vn, ω) when p is odd. Let p be an odd
prime.

The cohomology ring H •(Vn, Fp) is well known (see, e.g., [A]), namely

H •(Vn, Fp) =^(x1, . . . , xn) ⊗Fp

where deg(xi) = 1 and deg(yi) = 2 for all i = 1, . . . , n.

Fp[y1, . . . , yn],

The cocycles representing generators xi and yi can be explicitly described as
follows (below we identify cocycles with the cohomology classes they represent).
Deﬁne xi : Vn → Fp and yi : Vn × Vn → Fp by

(31)

and

(32)

xi(v) = vi

yi(u, v) =(0

1

if ui + vi < p,
if ui + vi ≥ p,

for all v = (v1, . . . vn), u = (u1, . . . un) in Vn and i = 1, . . . n. Here we view ui, vi
as elements of {0, 1, . . . , p − 1} and add them as usual integers.

In particular,

(33)

H 3(Vn, Fp) =^3

(x1, . . . , xn)M Fphxi ∪ yj | i, j = 1, . . . , ni,

where ∪ denotes the cup product. Note that the second summand in (33) is iso-
morphic to V ∗

n as a GLn(Fp)-module.

Proposition 5.1. There is an isomorphism of GLn(Fp)-modules:

(34)

H 3(Vn, k×) ∼=^3

(V ∗

n )M S2(V ∗

n ).

Proof. The automorphism of k× given by ξ 7→ ξp yields an exact sequence of abelian
groups:

0

/ Fp

/ k×

/ k×

/ 0,

where Fp is identiﬁed with the group of pth roots of 1 in k. This, by functoriality,
yields a long exact sequence of GLn(Fp)-modules:

· · ·

/ H m−1(Vn, Fp)
/ H m(Vn, Fp)

/ H m−1(Vn, k×)
/ H m(Vn, k×)

0

0

/ H m−1(Vn, k×)
/ H m(Vn, k×)

/ · · ·

Note that the map H m−1(Vn, k×) → H m−1(Vn, k×) induced by taking the pth
power is zero since the exponent of H m(Vn, k×) is p. The latter fact follows from
isomorphism H m(Vn, k×) = H m+1(Vn, Z) and the K¨unneth formula for the direct
product in cohomology.

In particular, there is a short exact sequence of GLn(Fp)-modules

(35)

0 → H 2(Vn, k×) δ−→ H 3(Vn, Fp) → H 3(Vn, k×) → 0.

We claim that the image of inclusion

δ : H 2(Vn, k×) =^2

(V ∗

n ) → H 3(Vn, Fp)

is the subspace of Fphxi∪yj | i, j = 1, . . . , ni ⊂ H 3(Vn, Fp) consisting of cohomology
i,j=1 aijxi ∪ yj, where A = {aij} is an anti-symmetric matrix

(36)

classes of the formPn

over Fp.

Indeed, (36) is given by the connecting homomorphism which is explicitly com-
puted as follows. Fix a primitive p-th root of unity ξ in k and consider homomor-
phism

A class in H 2(Vn, k×) is represented by a 2-cocycle µ : Vn × Vn → k× given by

Fp → k× : a 7→ ξa.

µ(u, v) = ξ(Au, v),

u, v ∈ Vn,

where A = {aij} is an n-by-n matrix over Fp and (Au, v) =Pn

as a non-negative integer.

Let λ be a ﬁxed pth root of ξ in k. Take a 2-cochain ν : Vn × Vn → k× deﬁned

i,j aij uivj is viewed

by

For non-negative integers a, b let us denote {a, b} the integral part of a+b

p . We have

ν(u, v) = λ(Au, v),

u, v ∈ Vn.

ν(u, v)ν(u′, v) = ν(u + u′, v) ξ{(Au,v),(Au′,v)},
ν(u, v)ν(u, v′) = ν(u, v + v′) ξ{(Au,v),(Au,v′)},

for all u, u′, v, v′ ∈ Vn. Using these identities we compute the diﬀerential of ν:

dν(u, v, w) =

ν(u + v, w)ν(u, v)
ν(u, v + w)ν(v, w)

=

ξ{(Au,v),(Au,w)}
ξ{(Au,w),(Av,w)} ,

u, v, w ∈ Vn.

Fix k, l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and take A such that aij = 1 if i = k and j = l and aij = 0
otherwise. Then the previous calculation yields

dν(u, v, w) =

ξuk{vl,wl}
ξwl{uk,vk} .

Since dν(u, v, w) = ξδ(µ)(u,v,w), we conclude that in this case

δ(µ)(u, v, w) = uk{vl, wl} − wl{uk, vk}.

Comparing this with (31) and (32) (note that yi(u, v) = {ui, vi}) we conclude that
the image of δ is spanned by

(37)

xk ∪ yl − xl ∪ yk, k, l = 1, . . . , n,

as claimed. The quotient of V ∗
symmetrization map. Since

n ⊗ V ∗

n by this space is isomorphic to S2(V ∗

n ) via the

H 3(Vn, k×) = H 3(Vn, Fp)/Image(δ : H 2(Vn, k×) → H 3(Vn, Fp)),

the statement follows from the last claim and (33).

(cid:3)

Given a cohomology class ω ∈ H 3(Vn, k×) denote

(38)

ω = ωalt + ωsym,

(V ∗

n ), ωsym ∈ S2(V ∗
n )

the decomposition of ω from (34).

Let V be a vector space. Consider the interior derivation

ωalt ∈^3
(V ∗) →^2

ι : V ⊗^3

given by

(V ∗) : v ⊗ φ 7→ ιv(φ),

ιv(x ∧ y ∧ z) = hv, zix ∧ y − hv, yix ∧ z + hv, xiy ∧ z,

for all v ∈ V, x, y, z ∈ V ∗, and extended toV3(V ∗) by linearity.
The radical of φ ∈V3(V ∗) is deﬁned as
We say that φ ∈V3(V ∗) is non-degenerate if Rad(φ) = 0.

Rad(φ) := {u ∈ V | ιu(φ) = 0}.

(39)

Proposition 5.2. Let v ∈ Vn and let ω ∈ H 3(Vn, k×). Then v, regarded as a
simple object in C(Vn, ω), is in the image of Inv(Z(C(Vn, ω))) → Inv(C(Vn, ω)) if
and only if v ∈ Rad(ωalt).

Proof. We claim that in this case the homomorphism

deﬁned by (22) and (23) is given by

β : Vn → H 2(Vn, k×) =^2
Let us ﬁrst prove this claim when ω = ωalt ∈ V3(V ∗

β(v) = ιv(ωalt),

v ∈ Vn.

part of ω in (38) is trivial). Such an ω is a linear combination of 3-cocycles ωijk
(i, j, k are distinct elements of {1, . . . , n}), given by ω(u, v, w) = ξuivj wk , where ξ
is a ﬁxed primitive pth root of 1 in k. So we may assume that ω = ωijk. We have

β(v) = vixj ∧ xk − vjxi ∧ xk + vkxi ∧ xj,

v = (v1, . . . , vn) ∈ Vn,

where xi are deﬁned by (31). Thus, β(v) = ιv(ωijk) and (40) is true in this case.

Next, let us prove the claim when ω = ωsym ∈ S2(V ∗

n ). We need to check
that β = 0 ∈ H 2(Vn, k×) in this case. We may assume that ω is the image of
xi ∪ yj ∈ H 3(Vn, Fp) under (35) i.e.,

ω(u, v, w) = ξxi(u)yj (v,w),

u, v, w ∈ Vn.

Since yj is symmetric (see (32)) we conclude that β(v) is the image of viyj under
the homomorphism H 2(Vn, Fp) → H 2(Vn, k×) and, hence, is trivial.

So, (40) is true for all ω ∈ H 3(Vn, k×) and the result follows from Proposition 4.1.
(cid:3)

Corollary 5.3. The category Z(C(Vn, ω)) is pointed if and only if ωalt = 0.

Corollary 5.4. Z(C(Vn, ω))pt = Rep(Vn) if and only if ωalt is non-degenerate.
In this case Z(C(Vn, ω))pt is the trivial component of the universal grading of
Z(C(Vn, ω)) and the universal grading group of Z(C(Vn, ω)) is Hom(Vn, k×), the
dual group of Vn.

Proof. This follows from Corollary 4.4.

(cid:3)

Theorem 5.5. Let ω ∈ H 3(Vn, k×) be such that ωalt is non-degenerate. There is
an exact sequence of groups:

(41)

0 → Vn

(V ∗

n ) → BrPic(C(Vn, ω)) → StabVn (ω) → 0.

ι(ωalt)

−−−−→^2

Proof. This follows from Proposition 4.5 and Corollary 4.7 applied to G = Vn. (cid:3)

Theorem 5.5 implies that the Brauer-Picard group of C(Vn, ω) is an extension

of StabVn (ω) = Stab(ωalt) ∩ Stab(ωsym) by an elementary abelian p-group.

5.2. The Brauer-Picard group of C(Vn, ω) when p = 2. It is known (see, e.g.,
[A]) that

H •(Vn, F2) = F2[x1, . . . , xn],

where xi, i = 1, . . . , n are one-dimensional generators represented by 1-cocycles

(42)

xi(v) = vi,

where v = (v1, . . . vn) ∈ Vn.

Proposition 5.6. There is an isomorphism of GLn(F2)-modules:

(43)

H 3(Vn, k×) ∼= S3(x1, . . . , xn)/F2hx2

i xj + xix2

j | i, j = 1, . . . , ni.

Proof. The argument is similar to that of Proposition 5.1. There is a short exact
sequence of GLn(F2)-modules

0 → H 2(Vn, k×) → H 3(Vn, F2) → H 3(Vn, k×) → 0.

The same computation as in the proof of Proposition 5.1 shows image of inclusion
n ) into H 3(Vn, Fp) = S3(x1, . . . , xn) is spanned by elements
xk ∪ yl + xl ∪ yk with k, l = 1, . . . , n (see (37)). Since for p = 2 we have yk = x2

the result follows.

Proof. Using Proposition 5.6 we see that H 3(Vn, k×) contains a GLn(F2)-submodule
spanned by x2

this submodule is isomorphic to S2(V ∗

For ω ∈ H 3(Vn, k×) let

Proposition 5.8. Let v ∈ Vn and let ω ∈ H 3(Vn, k×). Then v, regarded as a
simple object in C(Vn, ω), is in the image of Inv(Z(C(Vn, ω))) → Inv(C(Vn, ω)) if
and only if v ∈ Rad(ωalt).

Proof. This is similar to proof of Proposition 5.2.

(cid:3)

Corollary 5.9. The category Z(C(Vn, ω)) is pointed if and only if ωalt = 0.

Corollary 5.10. Corollary 5.4 and Theorem 5.5 hold for p = 2 (but note that the
meaning of ωalt is diﬀerent in this case, cf. (45))

Remark 5.11. Representation categories of twisted group doubles of elementary
Abelian 2-groups and braided tensor equivalences between them were studied by
Goﬀ, Mason, and Ng in [GMN]. The above results about the third cohomology of
Vn and invertible objects of Z(C(Vn, ω)) can be derived from that paper.

6. Computing Brauer-Picard groups: examples

Let p be a prime. A p-group G is called extra special if its center Z is cyclic
of order p and G/Z is elementary abelian. Such groups are well known: for each
positive integer n there exist precisely two non-isomorphic extra special p-groups
of order p2n+1.

Since G is a central extension of the form

(46)

0 → Fp → G → V2n → 0,

corresponding to some cohomology class κG ∈ H 2(Vn, Fp) we can apply the results
of Section 4.3. Namely, there is a braided equivalence

(47)

Z(C(G, 1)) ∼= Z(C(V2n+1, ωG)),

where ωG ∈ H 3(G, k×) is obtained from κG as follows. Choose a generator x0 of
H 1(Fp, Fp) = F∗

p and consider the cup product

H 1(Fp, Fp) ⊗Fp H 2(Vn, Fp) → H 3(V2n+1, Fp) : x0 ⊗ κ 7→ x0 ∪ κ.

Proposition 6.1. ωG is the image of x0 ∪ κG under the projection

H 3(V2n+1, Fp) → H 3(V2n+1, k×).

Proof. This follows from (29).

6.1. Brauer-Picard groups of representation categories of extra special
p-groups for odd p. Let p be an odd prime and let n be a positive integer.
Let D and Q denote extra special groups of order p2n+1 and exponents p and p2
respectively. They can be constructed as follows. Let M = (Z/pZ × Z/pZ) ⋊ Z/pZ
and N = Z/p2Z ⋊ Z/pZ be non-Abelian groups of order p3. Then D is the central
product of n copies of M and Q is the central product of N and n − 1 copies of M .
It is straightforward to compute cohomology classes κD, κQ ∈ H 2(V2n, Fp) cor-

responding to extension (46) with G = D, Q. We have

κD =

x2i−1 x2i,

x2i−1 x2i + y1,

where generators xi, yi are deﬁned by (31) and (32).

Recall from Proposition 5.1 that there is a GL2n+1(Fp)-module isomorphism

H 3(V2n+1, k×) ∼=^3

(x0, x1, . . . , x2n) ⊕ S2(z0, z1, . . . , z2n),

hence elements ω ∈ H 3(V2n+1, k×) correspond to pairs (ωalt, ωsym), where ωalt is
a degree 3 element of the exterior algebra and ωsym is a degree 2 element of the
symmetric algebra.

Below we identify ω with its image under isomorphism (50).

(50)

Proposition 6.2. We have

ωQ =  x0 ∧  nXi=1

x2i−1 ∧ x2i,! , z0z1! .

Proof. This follows from equations (48), (49), and Proposition 6.1.

(cid:3)

It follows from Theorem 5.5 that the Brauer-Picard groups BrPic(C(D, 1)) and
BrPic(C(Q, 1)) are extensions of Stab(ωD) and Stab(ωQ), respectively, by elemen-
tary Abelian p-groups. One can ﬁnd these stabilizers using the explicit formulas
(51) and (52). Below we do it for ωD.

Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space. For any subgroup G ⊂ GL(V ) deﬁne

the corresponding aﬃne group Af f G = V ⋊ G.

Proposition 6.3. Suppose n > 1. Then

Stab(ωD) ∼= Af f Sp2n(Fp) ⋊ F×

Here Sp2n(Fp) denotes the symplectic group.

Proof. Let {e0, e1, . . . , e2n} be the standard basis of V2n+1 so that {x0, x1, . . . , x2n}
is the dual basis of V ∗
the associated linear endomorphism of v given by

IAN MARSHALL AND DMITRI NIKSHYCH

For every g ∈ Stab(ωD) and every v ∈ V2n+1 the ranks of ιg(v)(ωD) and ιv(ωD) are
equal. It follows that the span of {e1, . . . , e2n} is stable under Stab(ωD). Indeed,
non-zero vectors v lying in this span are characterized by the property that ιv(ωD)
i=1 x2i−1 ∧ x2i (it corresponds to the symplectic form). An
i=1 viei and the dual of the restriction
of g on the span of {e1, . . . , e2n} must map s to λ−1s, where v = (v1, . . . v2n) is an
arbitrary vector in F2n

has rank 2. Let s =Pn
element g ∈ Stab(ωD) must map e0 to λe0+P2n

When n = 1, i.e., when D, Q are extra special groups of order p3, there is a neat

precise description of their Brauer-Picard groups.

Proposition 6.4. Let n = 1. Then

Stab(ωD) = SL3(Fp) and

Stab(ωQ) = Af f O2(Fp).

Proof. For any A ∈ GL3(Fp) we have

A(x0 ∧ x1 ∧ x2) = det(A)(x0 ∧ x1 ∧ x2)

inV3(x0, x1, x2), which proves the ﬁrst equality. The group of matrices in SL3(Fp)

stabilizing z0z1 ∈ S2(z0, z1, z2) is precisely the 2-dimensional aﬃne orthogonal
group, which proves the second equality.
(cid:3)

Corollary 6.5. Let D, Q be the extra special groups of order p3 of exponents p and
p2, respectively. Then

(53)

BrPic(C(D, 1)) ∼= SL3(Fp)

and

BrPic(C(Q, 1)) ∼= Af f O2(Fp).

Proof. Note that the homomorphisms ι(ωalt) for ω = ωD, ωQ in (41) are isomor-
phisms, so BrPic(C(V3, ω)) = Stab(ω) and the isomorphisms follow from Proposi-
tion 6.4.

Remark 6.6. The ﬁrst of isomorphisms in (53) was established by Riepel in [R]
by diﬀerent methods.

6.2. Brauer-Picard groups of representation categories of extra special

be constructed as follows. The group D is the central product of n copies of the
dihedral group of order 8 and Q is the central product n − 1 copies of the dihedral
group of order 8 and one copy of the quaternion group.

In view of Corollary 5.10 the Brauer-Picard groups of C(D, 1) and C(Q, 1) are

Proposition 6.11. Let n > 1. Then
Stab(ωD) ∼= Sp2n(F2)

and

Stab(ωQ) ∼= Sp2n(F2)

Proof. Second cohomology classes κD and κQ deﬁned in equations (54) and (55),
represent the two equivalence classes of quadratic forms in even dimension [W,
3.4.7]. Their respective stabilizers, the orthogonal groups O+
2n(F2),
are identiﬁed with subgroups of Stab(ωD) and Stab(ωQ).

2n(F2) and O−

It is known that O+

2n(F2) and O−

2n(F2) are maximal subgroups of Sp2n(F2) [P,

Theorem 1.5].

Let M ∈ GL(V2n+1) be deﬁned by

M (v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, . . . , v2n−1, v2n) = (v0, v1, v2, v0 + v3 + v4, v4, . . . , v2n−1, v2n).

Note that M ∈ Stab(ωD) and M ∈ Stab(ωQ), however, it is not an element of either
orthogonal subgroup. Thus the images of inclusions speciﬁed in Proposition 6.10
properly contain maximal subgroups. It follows that these are isomorphisms. (cid:3)

Proposition 6.12. Let n = 1. Then
Stab(ωD) ∼= S4

and

Stab(ωQ) = S3.

Proof. For any ω ∈ H 3(V3, k×) = S3(x0, x1, x2)/F2hx2
evaluation map

i xj + xix2

j | i, j = 0, 1, 2i the

V3 → F2 : (v0, v1, v2) 7→ ω(v0, v1, v2)

is well deﬁned and, furthermore, ω is completely determined by the set of vectors
of V3 mapped to 1 (cf. [M]).

For ω = ωD = x0x1x2 this set consists of the single vector (1, 1, 1). So Stab(ωD)
is precisely the subgroup of automorphisms of V3 ﬁxing this vector, i.e., Stab(ωD) ∼=
Af f GL2(F2) ∼= F2
2

⋊ GL2(F2) ∼= S4.

For ω = ωQ = x0x1x2 +x0x2

2 this set consists of vectors (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0),
and (1, 0, 1). The group Stab(ωQ) consists of automorphisms of V3 permuting these
vectors. Since they form a basis of V3, we conclude Stab(ωQ) ∼= S3.

Corollary 6.13. Let D, Q be the dihedral group and quaternion groups of order 8,
respectively. Then

(61)

BrPic(C(D, 1)) ∼= S4

Proof. Note that the homomorphisms ι(ωalt) for ω = ωD, ωQ in (41) are isomor-
phisms, so BrPic(C(V3, ω)) = Stab(ω) and the isomorphisms follow from Proposi-
tion 6.12.

methods.

Deﬁnition 6.15. A pre-metric Lie algebra is a Lie algebra g equipped with an
invariant symmetric bilinear form ( , ), i.e., such that

([a, b], c) = (a, [b, c]),

for all a, b, c ∈ g. A metric Lie algebra is a pre-metric Lie algebra such that ( , ) is
non-degenerate.

For a Lie algebra g let Aut(g) denote the group of Lie algebra automorphisms
of g. For a pre-metric Lie algebra g let Autm(g) ⊂ Aut(g) denote the group of Lie
algebra automorphisms of g preserving ( , ).

Consider the following bilinear symmetric and trilinear alternating forms on g:

˜ωsym(a, b) = (a, b)

and

˜ωalt(a, b, c) = ([a, b], c),

a, b, c ∈ g,

and identify them with ωsym ∈ S2(g∗) and ωalt ∈V3(g∗) by means of symmetriza-

Let V denote the underlying additive group of g. It is an elementary abelian

tion and anti-symmetrization maps.

p-group.

Set

(62)

ω = ωalt + ωsym ∈ H 3(V, k×).

Proposition 6.16. Let g be a metric Lie algebra such that g = [g, g] and let
ω ∈ H 3(V, k×) be the 3-cocycle constructed above. Then Stab(ω) ∼= Autm(g).

Proof. It is clear that each φ ∈ Autm(g) stabilizes ˜ωsym and ˜ωalt. Hence, it stabilizes
ω. Conversely, if ψ is a group automorphism of V stabilizing ω then it must stabilize
both ωsym and ωalt. The former condition means that ψ preserves ( , ) and the latter
one means that it is a Lie algebra homomorphism.
(cid:3)

Proposition 6.17. Let g be a pre-metric Lie algebra. Then ωalt ∈V3(g∗) is non-

degenerate if and only if g = [g, g] and ( , ) is non-degenerate (i.e., g is a metric
Lie algebra).

Proof. Non-degeneracy of ωalt is equivalent to non-degeneracy of the alternating
trilinear form ˜ωalt. This implies the statement.
(cid:3)

Corollary 6.18. Suppose that g is a metric Lie algebra such that g = [g, g]. There
is an exact sequence

(63)

(V ∗) → BrPic(C(V, ω)) → Autm(g) → 0.

0 → V →^2

Proof. This follows from Theorem 5.5 and Propositions 6.16 and 6.17.

(cid:3)

One can take ( , ) to be the Killing form of g :

(a, b) = Trg(ad(a) ad(b)),

a, b ∈ g,

where ad denotes the adjoint representation of g. Let ωg ∈ H 3(V, k×) denote the
corresponding 3rd cohomology class deﬁned by (62).

Remark 6.19. If g has a non-degenerate Killing form then g is a direct sum of
simple Lie algebras. Unlike for Lie algebras over C, the converse to this statement
is false in positive characteristic. All simple classical Lie algebras with a non-
degenerate Killing over a ﬁeld F with char(F ) > 3 are known. The necessary and
suﬃcient condition is that char(F ) should not divide the determinant of the Killing
form of the corresponding simple complex Lie algebra, see [S, Chapter II §9].

20

IAN MARSHALL AND DMITRI NIKSHYCH

It can even happen that every trace form of a simple g is degenerate, this is the

case, e.g., for g = sln(F ) when char(F ) divides n.

Proposition 6.20. Let g be a simple Lie algebra with a non-degenerate Killing
form. We have an exact sequence

0 → V →^2

(V ∗) → BrPic(C(V, ωg)) → Aut(g) → 0,

Proof. It is clear that when ( , ) given by the Killing form of g we have Autm(g) =
Aut(g). The result follows from Corollary 6.18.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.21. The automorphism groups of classical simple modular Lie algebras
g are known [S].

Thus, ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type naturally appear as composition factors of
groups of autoequivalences and Brauer-Picard groups of pointed fusion categories.

Example 6.22. Take g = sl2(F ). Since p is odd, the Killing form is non-degenerate.
Let

6.4. Representation category of the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra. Recall
that the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra KP is the unique non-commutative and non-
cocommutative semisimple Hopf algebra of dimension 8 [KP].

Let KP be the fusion category of representations of KP . Below we compute the

Brauer-Picard group of KP.

Note that KP is a particular case of a Tambara-Yamagami fusion category [TY].
Recall that such categories T Y(A, χ, τ ) are deﬁned as follows. Let A be a ﬁnite
Abelian group. The set of simple objects of T Y(A, χ, τ ) is {a | a ∈ A} ∪ {m} with
tensor products given by

a ⊗ b = ab,

a ⊗ m = m ⊗ a = m,

m ⊗ m =Ma∈A

,

and associativity constraints determined by a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear
form χ : A ⊗ A → k× and τ ∈ k such that τ 2 = |A|−1 (see [TY] for details of the
deﬁnition). It was shown in [TY, Section 4] that

(64)

KP ∼= T Y(Z2 × Z2, χ,

),

where χ is the bilinear form on Z2 × Z2 = {1, a, b, c} determined by

χ(a, a) = 1, χ(b, b) = χ(c, c) = −1, χ(b, c) = 1.

The centers of Tambara-Yamagami categories and their S- and T -matrices were
explicitly described in [GNN, Section 4C]. The following result is immediate from
that description.

Lemma 6.23. The forgetful homomorphism

Inv(Z(T Y(A, χ, τ ))) → Inv(T Y(A, χ, τ ))

is surjective.

Let D and Q denote, respectively, the dihedral and quaternion groups of order 8.

We will use the following presentation of D by generators and relations:

D = hr, s | r4 = s2 = 1, rs = sr−1i.

(i) Z(KP)pt ∼= Rep(Z3

2) is a symmetric non-Tannakian cate-

gory.

(ii) Z(KP) has precisely two Lagrangian subcategories; both of them are equi-

valent to Rep(D).

(iii) KP has a unique, up to equivalence, ﬁber functor (i.e., a tensor functor to

Vec).

Proof. Using the description of Z(KP) from [GNN] and equivalence (64) one sees
that every invertible object x of KP has precisely 2 structures of an object of
Z(KP) and the square of the braiding between objects supported on invertible
objects x, y ∈ A is χ(x, y)idxy. This proves (i).

Inspecting the S- and T -matrices of Z(T Y(A, χ, τ )) we conclude that Lagrangian
subcategories of Z(KP) are precisely those that contain 4 invertible objects sup-
ported on 1, a and one two-dimensional simple object supported either on 1 ⊕ a
or on b ⊕ c. So there are two such subcategories. Since the dihedral group D and
the quaternionic group Q are the only non-Abelian groups of order 8 the above
Lagrangian categories must be equivalent to either Rep(D) or to Rep(Q). The lat-
ter case leads to a contradiction:
it implies that Z(KP) = Z(C(Q, η)) for some
non-trivial η ∈ H 3(Q, k×). But C(Q, η) is not categorically Morita equivalent to
the representation category of a Hopf algebra by [O]. This proves (ii).

Finally, (iii) follows for the classiﬁcation of ﬁber functors on Tambara-Yamagami
(cid:3)

categories [T].

Lemma 6.25. Let C be a fusion category categorically Morita equivalent to KP.
Then either C ∼= KP or C ∼= C(D, ω) for some non-trivial 3-cocycle ω ∈ H 3(D, k×).

Proof. If C is not pointed then it must be a Tambara-Yamagami category. Com-
bining Lemmas 6.23 and 6.24(i) we conclude that Inv(C) = Z2 × Z2. It is proved in
[NN, Section 5.2] that the only fusion category with the group of invertible objects
Z2 × Z2 categorically Morita equivalent to KP is KP itself.

If C is pointed then it corresponds to a Lagrangian subcategory in Z(KP) and
(cid:3)

the statement follows from Lemma 6.24(ii).

Using Lemma 6.24(iii), description of ω from [KP], and classiﬁcation of ﬁber
functors on group-theoretical categories [O] one can list all indecomposable C(D, ω)-
module categories (and, hence, all indecomposable KP-module categories). There
are precisely 6 such categories, parameterized by conjugacy classes of subgroups of
D on which ω has trivial restriction, namely: 1, hr2i, hr2, si, hsri, hr2, sri, hsi.

Remark 6.26. The same list of KP-module categories can be obtained using the
classiﬁcation of module categories over Tambara-Yamagami categories from [MM].
We are grateful to Ehud Meir for sharing his calculations with us.

Corollary 6.27. There are precisely 2 equivalence classes of indecomposable KP-
module categories such that the dual fusion category is pointed and precisely 4 equiv-
alence classes of indecomposable KP-module categories such that the dual fusion
category is equivalent to KP.

Proof. Module KP-categories with pointed duals correspond to Lagrangian subcat-
egories of Z(KP). Since there are 6 classes of indecomposable KP-module catego-
ries, the result follows from Lemma 6.24(ii)
(cid:3)

Corollary 6.28. | BrPic(KP)| = 8.

Proof. By Corollary 6.27 KP has 4 module categories with the dual KP, so the
statement follows from Proposition 3.6 and the fact that Aut(KP) = Z2 [T].
(cid:3)

Corollary 6.29. The image of the induction homomorphism

(65)

Aut(C(D, ω)) → Autbr(Z(C(D, ω))) = Autbr(Z(KP))

is isomorphic to Z2 × Z2.

Proof. By Remark 3.7 (see also [NR]) Autbr(Z(KP)) acts transitively on Lagrangian
subcategories of Z(KP) and the image of (65) is precisely the stabilizer of a La-
grangian subcategory Rep(D). Hence, this image must contain 4 elements by Corol-
lary 6.28. These elements are the autoequivalences of the form ind(Fa, µ), where
a ∈ Stab(ω) and µ is a 2-coboundary such that

d2µ =

ω ◦ (a × a × a)

ω

,

see Section 2.3. Note that Out(D) ∼= Z2, where the class of non-trivial outer
automorphism is represented by a ∈ Aut(D) such that a(r) = r, a(s) = sr.

Consider the action of the above autoequivalences ind(Fa, µ) on Z(C(D, ω))pt.
The invertible objects of the center are supported on {1, r2}. One easily checks that
autoequivalences ind(F1, µ) ﬁx central objects supported on 1 and non-trivially per-
mute those supported on r2, while autoequivalences ind(Fa, µ) non-trivially permute
central objects supported on 1 and have order 2. Thus, the induced autoequiva-
lences form a group isomorphic to Z2 × Z2.
(cid:3)

Proposition 6.30. BrPic(KP) ∼= Z2 × Z2 × Z2.

Proof. Consider the Picard induction homomorphism (see Section 2.5)

(66)

Pic(Z(KP)pt) → Pic(Z(KP)) = BrPic(KP) : M 7→ Z(KP) ⊠Z(KP)pt M.

By Lemma 6.24(i) and the result of [C] we have Pic(Z(KP)pt) = Z4
2. On the
other hand, by (11) the kernel of (66) coincides with the universal grading group
of Z(KP), i.e., is isomorphic to Z3
2. Thus, the image of (66) has order 2. Let
α ∈ Autbr(Z(KP)) correspond to the non-trivial element of this image. Since α
induces the trivial autoequivalence of Z(KP)pt, it is not in the image of (65), cf. the
proof of Corollary 6.29. Hence, α must permute the two Lagrangian subcategories of
Z(KP). Since these subcategories are ﬁxed by the image of (65) we get an injective
homomorphism from Autbr(KP) to Z3
2 and the result follows from Corollary 6.28.
