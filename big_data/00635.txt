We perform spectroscopic measurements of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a
strongly interacting Rydberg gas, and observe a signiﬁcant spectral shift of the transparency from
the single-atom EIT resonance as well as a spectral dephasing of the same order. We characterize the
shift and dephasing as a function of atomic density, probe Rabi frequency, and principal quantum
number of Rydberg states, and demonstrate that the observed spectral shift and dephasing are
reduced if the size of a Gaussian atomic cloud is increased. We simulate our experiment with a
semi-analytical model, which gives results in good agreement with our experimental data.

Atomic systems driven in the conﬁguration of elec-
tromagnetically induced transparency involving a Ryd-
berg state (Rydberg EIT) [1] are promising systems for
the investigation of quantum nonlinear optics [2, 3] and
quantum many-body physics [4, 5] with strong interac-
tions and correlations. With Rydberg EIT, non-linearity
at the single photon level has been demonstrated with
the remarkable realizations of photon ﬁlters, determinis-
tic single photon sources, and interaction between pairs
of photons [6–8], and also been utilized to implement
single-photon transistors [9, 10]. Moreover, the recent
demonstration of interaction enhanced absorption imag-
ing (IEAI) [11, 12] conﬁrms the great potential of Ryd-
berg EIT for the study of many-body physics with Ryd-
berg atoms.

In Rydberg EIT, highly correlated many-body atomic
states arising from the interaction-induced blockade [13–
16] result in strong nonlinear optical response, and can
be mapped onto the probe ﬁeld propagating through the
medium. Thus detailed studies on the spectral, tempo-
ral, and spatial properties of the transmitted probe light
are crucial for proper understanding of such systems and
their further applications in quantum optics, quantum
information, and quantum many-body physics. Because
of the large parameter space and complex dynamics of
Rydberg EIT ensembles in the blockade regime, many
questions remain open in spite of signiﬁcant investiga-
tion eﬀorts, both experimental [3, 17–23] and theoret-
ical [19, 24–31]. All of Rydberg EIT experiments in
the blockade regime have observed the reduction of the
EIT transparency at the probe resonance due to Rydberg
blockade induced dissipation, also called photon blockade
[32], and most of them have seen the spectral dephasing
as well. However, the spectral shift of the transparency
resonance, as predicted by several theoretical models, has
only been observed in two experiments [23, 33], but re-
mains elusive in others. Theoretical calculations, while
succeeding to describe certain experimental observations,
have yet converged to a comprehensive physical picture

due to the challenges posted by strong correlation and
dissipation in such systems.

In this letter we present a set of Rydberg EIT measure-
ments that clearly show the spectral shift and dephas-
ing and their dependence on atomic density, interaction
strength, and input probe light intensity. Our experimen-
tal data agree well with the simulation results of a simple
model based on previous semi-analytical results obtained
from the Monte Carlo rate equations approach [26] and
the superatom model [25]. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that as the size of a Gaussian atomic cloud is increased,
the observed spectral shift and dephasing are reduced.
This study provides important experimental evidences to
advance the understanding on the spectral properties of
Rydberg EIT.

The experiment was performed with a 87Rb atomic
cloud released from a horizontally positioned single-beam
optical dipole trap (ODT), which was formed by a 1064
nm laser beam with a power of 3.1 W and a 1/e2 Gaus-
sian radius of 42.6 µm. Atoms were loaded into the ODT
from a molasses cooled atomic ensemble, the preparation
of which was detailed in Ref.[34]. Subsequently, a guid-
ing ﬁeld of approximately 3.5 Gauss along the vertical
direction pointing downwards was switched on to deﬁne
the quantization axis z, and the atoms in the ODT were
optically pumped into the |5s1/2, F = 2, mF = 2i (|gi)
state. At this stage, the atomic cloud had a temperature
in the range 40 to 60 µK. The atomic cloud was then re-
leased for a time of ﬂight (TOF) before the spectroscopic
measurement. By changing the ODT loading eﬃciency
and/or the TOF duration, the peak atomic density of
the ground state |gi, n0, and the 1/e2 radius of the cloud
along the vertical direction, wz, could be varied indepen-
dently in the ranges of 0.1−3×1011 cm−3 and 15−80 µm,
respectively.
Shown in Fig. 1 are the schematics of the energy lev-
els and the optical setup for Rydberg EIT, the details
of which are similar to that in Ref.[34]. At each exper-
imental cycle after TOF of the atomic cloud, the probe

FIG. 1. (a) Three-level Rydberg EIT scheme for spectroscopic
measurements. A probe beam of Rabi frequency Ωp is de-
tuned ∆p from the |5s1/2, F = 2, mF = 2i (|gi) → |5p3/2, F =
3, mF = 3i (|ei) transition and a coupling beam of Rabi fre-
quency Ωc is on resonance with the |5p3/2, F = 3, mF = 3i
→ |ns1/2, J = 1/2, mJ = 1/2i (|ri) transition, where n is the
principal quantum number of a Rydberg state. (b) Schemat-
ics of the experimental conﬁguration. The probe and coupling
beams counter-propagate coaxially along the z direction in
the σ+-σ− polarization conﬁguration. While the probe beam
has a collimated 1/e2 Gaussian radius of 3.45 mm, the cou-
pling beam is focused at the center of the atomic cloud with a
1/e2 Gaussian radius of 50 µm and a peak Rabi frequency of
Ωc0. The transparent spot in the shadow of the atomic cloud
on the EMCCD (electron-multiplying charge-coupled device)
camera screen illustrates the transparency window opened by
the coupling beam for the probe beam to pass through.

and coupling beams were turned on simultaneously for 15
µs during which an EMCCD camera was exposed to ac-
quire the image of the probe beam transmitted through
the atomic cloud via a diﬀraction limited optical system.
To obtain an EIT transmission spectrum, a set of images
of the transmitted probe light were taken while varying
the probe beam detuning ∆p from shot to shot to scan
through the resonance of the |gi ↔ |ei transition but ﬁx-
ing the coupling beam frequency to be on resonance with
the |ei ↔ |ri transition. The probe transmission (I/I0)
was extracted by taking the ratio between the probe in-
tensity I passing through the center of the coupling beam
(with Rabi frequency Ωc0) and that of the incoming probe
beam without atomic cloud (I0), and plotted vs. ∆p to
get the transmission spectra in Fig. 2.

ity for the probe light at the ﬁrst order is given by

where λ is the wavelength of the probe transition, σ0 =

sition, Γe = 2π × 6.067 MHz is the decay rate of inter-

probe and coupling lights, and ﬁnally γge ≈ Γe/2 and

atomic sample in this experiment is rather thin along the
beam propagation direction z, lensing can be neglected
[34], and the spatial dependent terms in Eq. (1) are re-
duced to a constant Ωc0 and one-dimensional functions
χ(1) (z) and nat (z). As the incoming probe light of Rabi
frequency Ωp0 propagates through the atomic sample,
the solution of the one-dimensional Maxwell’s equation

where k is the wavenumber of the probe light k = 2π/λ
and OD corresponds to the optical density of the atomic

In an interacting Rydberg gas, the single-atom Ry-
dberg energy level is shifted by the strong interaction,
which for ns state in our experiment is the repulsive
van der Waals interaction V (r) = −C6/r6, where the
strength coeﬃcient C6 scales as n11 [35]. One of the
most important consequences of this energy level shift is
the blockade eﬀect that allows only one Rydberg excita-
tion among many atoms within a sphere of radius RB.
The interaction induced level shift and excitation block-
ade greatly modify the susceptibility of the EIT ensem-
ble. The linear susceptibility in Eq. (1) is now changed
to a nonlocal nonlinear susceptibility, which in princi-
ple is given by the solution of a full master equation of
the interacting many-body system, and this change is
reﬂected in the EIT transmission spectra.
In a simple
and intuitive physical picture, the shifted Rydberg en-
ergy level detunes the transparency away from that of
the non-interacting EIT reasonance, and the blockade ef-
fect results in scattering around each blockaded sphere,
which gives rise to additional decoherence compared to
that of the single-atom EIT. The resulting spectral shift
and dephasing of the EIT transmission depend on the
interaction strength C6, the density of blockaded spheres
(Rydberg excitations) nRyd, and the number of atoms
inside each blockaded sphere NB.

A set of values around the middle of our experimen-
tal parameter range, ns = 38s, n0 = 2.1 × 1011 cm−3,
Ωc0/2π = 5.6 MHz, Ωp0/2π = 1.45 MHz, ∆p = 0,
gives the blockade radius RB = (−2C6/γEIT)1/6 =
2.4 µm, the atom number per unit blockaded sphere
NB = n0 × 4πR3
B/3 = 5, and the Rydberg atom density
nRyd = n0×fR = 1.05×1010 cm−3, where γEIT = Ω2
c0/Γe
is the on resonance single atom EIT linewidth [7] and fR
is the Rydberg excitation fraction. This indicates that
the Rydberg EIT system in our experiment goes into the
blockade regime of this interacting many-body system.
In the three sets of transmission spectra in Fig. 2, there
is an increasing blue shift of transparency away from the
single atom EIT resonance (∆p = 0) as well as an increas-
ing dephasing, when the ground state atomic density n0,
the incoming probe Rabi frequency Ωp0, or the principal

To extract the amplitudes of the spectral shift VR and
dephasing γR, we ﬁt the experimental EIT transmission
spectra to Eq. (2) with ∆c, γgr and OD as the ﬁtting
parameters. While experimentally the coupling light fre-
quency is always on the resonance of the single-atom
transition |ei ↔ |ri, ∆c is set to be a ﬁtting parame-
ter to account for the shift VR = −∆c due to Rydberg
interactions. γR = γgr is set to be a ﬁtting parame-
ter to account for the total dephasing rate coming from
both the dephasing due to interaction and the decay of
atomic coherence in the single-atom Rydberg EIT, which
is γ0 ≈ 100 kHz in our experiment [34]. A couple sample
ﬁttings are shown in Fig. 2 (a), and the extracted shift
VR = −∆c and dephasing γR = γgr are plotted against
n0, Ωp0 and n in Fig. 3. The shift and dephasing are
increasing with n0, Ωp0, and n, and their amplitudes are

FIG. 3. Spectral shift and dephasing of EIT transmission
spectra. The spectral shift VR = −∆c and dephasing γR =
γgr are extracted by ﬁtting the experimental(◭) and the simu-
lated (◮) transmission spectra to Eq. (2), and plotted against
(a) n0, (b) Ωp0, and (c) n. The solid lines are plots of ∆R
and √ϑR as expressed in Eqs. (4) and (5) with nat = n0 and
Ωp = Ωp0. For these measurements done in the thin atomic
samples, this simple expression of ∆R seems to agree well with
the observed shift, while √ϑR only gives a good account of
the experimental data at very small dephasings.

of the same order.

We simulate our experimental transmission spectra by
approximating the nonlinear susceptibility χ of the inter-
acting Rydberg EIT ensemble as a sum of two contribu-
tions [25, 31],

χ ≈ χBfR (NB − 1) + χE (1 − fR(NB − 1)) ,

(3)

where fR(NB − 1) is the fraction of atoms inside the
blockaded spheres excluding Rydberg atoms and every
physical quantity in the equation is a function of z.
χB in the ﬁrst term is the susceptibility of atoms in-
side the blockaded sphere, and is nearly equal to the
two-level atom susceptibility. χE in the second term is
the susceptibility of unblockaded atoms (including Ryd-
berg excitations themselves) more than RB distance from
any (other) Rydberg excitations. Since the unblockaded
atoms could be excited to interact with other Rydberg

excitations, χE = χ(cid:0)∆c = −∆R, γgr = √ϑR + γ0(cid:1) is the

susceptibility of three-level Rydberg EIT with the shifted
energy level obtained from the steady state solution of
the single atom master equation to the fourth order [34],
where ∆R accounts for the average energy level shift due
to interactions with surrounding Ryderg atoms, and √ϑR

accounts for the deviation of the level shift from the mean
value ∆R. ∆R and √ϑR are evaluated with a simple
mean-ﬁeld approach [23, 24], where the average shift felt
by an atom i is the sum over the interactions with all
, and the variance

Rydberg excitations j, ∆R ≈ Pj
ij (cid:17)2
of this average shift is given by ϑR = (cid:16)P −C6

R.
At each spatial position z, ∆R and ϑR are calculated
by replacing the sum with an integral and using the lo-
cal density approximation (LDA) for nat(z) and Ωp(z),

The simulated EIT spectra are produced by numeri-
cally solving the Maxwell’s equation with the approxi-
mate susceptibility in Eq. (3) and the experimental pa-
rameters as inputs, and they agree reasonably well with
the experimental spectra, as shown by the samples in
Fig. 2 (a). The shift VR and dephasing γR of these sim-
ulated spectra are extracted by ﬁtting to Eq. (2) as in
the case of experimental spectra, and plotted along with
the experimental results in Fig. 3. The spectral shifts are
deﬁnitely well captured by our model, and the dephas-
ings deviate only at large n0, Ωp0, or n. This discrep-
ancy could be due to our very simple estimation of χE
and/or due to the additional dissipative mechanism from
the increasing correlation between Rydberg excitations,
which is not properly accounted by the mean-ﬁeld model.
Moreover, the three plots of √ϑR in Fig. 3 indicate that
a signiﬁcant contribution to the dephasing comes from
the dispersion of energy level shifts, which is of the same
order as the mean value of energy shifts. This explains
why the observed spectral shift and dephasing have sim-
ilar amplitudes.

An important result from the above simulation, which
agrees with our experimental observations, is that the
spectral shift and dephasing appear to be smaller for a
Gaussian atomic sample with lager size than for a smaller
size one, while both have the same peak atomic density,
as shown in Fig. 4. This reduction in the observed shift
and dephasing can be explained by the inhomogeneity of
the EIT ensemble together with the dependence shown
in Fig. 3. As the probe light enters the atomic sample,
it ﬁrst sees the lower atomic density at the wing part of

Ωc0/2π = 5.2 MHz, Ωp0/2π = 1.5 MHz, n0 = 1.2×1011 cm−3,
and ns = 38s. The uncertainties for the experimental param-
eters are the same as that in the caption of Fig. 2. Shown
as well are the simulated spectral curves with the same ex-
perimental conditions and with the atomic cloud sizes of

the Gaussian density proﬁle; and when the light reaches
the center of the sample with the high atomic density, its
intensity has already been attenuated due to scattering
along its way. Given the similar peak atomic density, this
eﬀect of inhomogeneity in a thicker atomic sample obvi-
ously appears more pronounced than that in a thinner
one, and correspondingly results in smaller spectral shift
and dephasing.

In conclusion, we have observed the spectral shift and
dephasing of Rydberg EIT and clearly mapped out their
dependence on density, probe Rabi frequency, and Ry-
dberg principal quantum number. While the spectral
shifts agree very well with the theoretical prediction over
the whole parameter range, the spectral dephasings are
consistently larger than that predicted by the simple
model at high Rydberg excitation or large blockade. This
discrepancy invites further investigations. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the observed spectral shift and de-
phasing also depend on the size of the Gaussian atomic
sample. This clear observation of spectral shift raises the
prospect to realize interaction induced optical switches,
and these spectroscopic measurements are highly relevant
for imaging Rydberg excitations via IEAI based on Ry-
dberg EIT. Moreover, it would be interesting to extend
our experiment into the parameter regime, where collec-
tive excitations could give a Rydberg excitation fraction
higher than that of a noninteracting Rydberg gas [36].
