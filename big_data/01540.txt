Abstract

Starting from a bare scalar potential with two degenerate minima at φ = ±v, and assum-
ing that both minima contribute to the partition function, the eﬀective potential is explicitly
calculated at one loop. The true vacuum of the dressed theory is at φ = 0 for ﬁnite spacetime
volume: the eﬀective potential is convex and suppressed by this volume, between the dressed
mass scales ±vdressed. In this interval, the eﬀective potential has a universal functional form,
for which higher order quantum corrections modify only the mass scale vdressed. At ﬁnite tem-
perature, the volume-suppressed part of the eﬀective potential exists only below the usual
critical temperature and, as a consequence, the free energy ceases to be extensive and the
thermodynamical potentials are frozen.

Introduction

For a scalar theory with several degenerate vacuua, it is usually assumed that spontaneous
symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs and that one speciﬁc vacuum is chosen. This is actually true
for inﬁnite volume, where the tunnel eﬀect between diﬀerent vacuua is completely suppressed.
But for ﬁnite volume, even the slightest tunneling possibility between diﬀerent degenerate
vacuua should allow these to play an equivalent role at equilibrium, for the true vacuum of
the dressed theory to be a superposition of the bare vacuua. It has been known for a long time
that the eﬀective potential is then convex [1], which is a consequence of its deﬁnition in terms
of a Legendre transform [2]. It has been shown, from the early days of eﬀective potential
methods [3], that convexity cannot be achieved when quantisation is based on one vacuum
only, if the bare potential has several degenerate vacuua [4]. The eﬀective potential actually
becomes convex as a consequence of the competition of the diﬀerent non-trivial saddle points
[5], and is thus a non-perturbative eﬀect.

Gauge ﬁxing could also impose a speciﬁc vacuum for the scalar ﬁeld, therefore avoiding
convexity of the eﬀective potential. Nevertheless, a construction of a convex eﬀective Higgs
potential is given in [6], where gauge ﬁxing picks two points on the manifold of vacuua of
the bare potential. It is shown that a convex eﬀective potential can then be obtained from
a linear interpolation between these two vacuua, to any loop order. The explicit form of the
eﬀective potential is not given though.

1

An explicit construction of the convex saddle point eﬀective potential (ignoring loop
corrections) is given for the ﬁrst time in [7], where the eﬀective potential is derived as an
expansion in the classical ﬁeld, up to the fourth order, for a ﬁnite spacetime volume V (4). In
this work, the degenerate vacuua of an O(N)-symmetric scalar theory, with |~φvac| = v, all
contribute to the saddle point approximation for the partition function. The path integral
quantisation is then followed step by step, where all the quantities are expanded in either the
source or the classical ﬁeld. The resulting eﬀective potential is a convex polynomial, which is
suppressed by V (4), as a consequence of an interpolation between the diﬀerent bare vacuua.
Therefore it becomes ﬂat in the limit of inﬁnite volume, and SSB is reached only in this limit,
where the true vacuum is an arbitrary point of a ﬂat N-ball with radius v.

Although not studied in [7], Goldstone modes then arise, which should stay massless to
all orders in perturbation theory. This is shown in [8], using an improved Conwall-Jackiw-
Tomboulis eﬀective action [9].

The present article (restricted to a single real scalar ﬁeld) shows an alternative construc-
tion, which is not based on an expansion in ﬁelds, but in (v4V (4))−1 instead. This approach
leads to an eﬀective potential which is valid to all orders in the classical ﬁeld, and whose
Taylor expansion to the fourth order is consistent with [7]. The true vacuum of the (dressed)
theory is located at φ = 0, and SSB does not occur as long as V (4) is ﬁnite. This result is ﬁrst
obtained in the saddle point approximation for the partition function, at zero temperature,
and we show that one-loop corrections do not change the functional form of the eﬀective
potential, but only redeﬁne the mass scale v. We show then that these results hold at ﬁnite
temperature too, as long as one is below a critical temperature.

Concerning the true vacuum of a theory, we note that a systematic construction of eﬀective
theories is done in [10], where tadpoles are removed consistently with the true vacuum. In
the situation where the bare vacuua are not degenerate, one can also consider the famous
problem of false vacuum decay [11], for which radiative corrections are considered in [12],
and gauge invariance is shown in [13]. But these studies assume a time dependence of the
ground state of the theory, whereas we consider here the equilibrium situation in the case of
a symmetric potential.

This article is structured as follows. The explicit construction of the eﬀective potential
at zero temperature, within the saddle point approximation, is done in section 2. The one-
loop corrections are calculated in section 3, and the results are expected to be identical at
higher order loops, up to a redeﬁnition of the mass scale v of the theory. The extension to
ﬁnite temperature is done in section 4, where the eﬀective potential is suppressed by the
three-dimensional space volume, as long as one stays below the usual critical temperature.
This suppression holds in an interval deﬁned by the temperature-dependent renormalised
mass scale corresponding to the vev v. An important consequence is that the free energy is
not extensive, as well as the entropy, and the latter happens to be a constant which can be
simply interpreted. The conclusion of the article discusses potential physical applications of
this volume-suppressed convex eﬀective potential, which could be relevant in a cosmological
context. The article ends with three Appendices: (i) Appendix A gives the general argument
for convexity of the eﬀective potential; (ii) Appendix B shows that bounce saddle points
between the two bare vacuua do not play a role for the eﬀective potential, if one starts with
a symmetric bare potential; (iii) Appendix C treats the example of a cosine bare potential,
for which it is shown that the saddle point eﬀective potential is completely ﬂat. This result
is expected from the assumptions of convexity, periodicity and diﬀerentiability.

2 Saddle point approximation

We start from the bare potential

Ubare(φ) =

λ
24

(φ2 − v2)2 ,

(1)

and we are interested in the eﬀective potential only, such that the source j appearing in the
partition function is chosen as a constant. We note, in Euclidean metric,

Z[j] = Z D[φ] exp(cid:18)−S[φ] −Z jφ(cid:19) ≡ e−W [j] ,

(2)

and the partition function Z[j] will be approximated by the sum over the dominant saddle
points φn. We will consider the uniform conﬁgurations only, since we show in appendix B
that the “bounce” solutions, originally considered in [11] for the calculation of tunneling
rates, are negligible.
The uniform saddle points of the partition function are solutions of the equation

U ′

bare(φn) + j = 0 ,

(3)

and the number of these solutions depends on the source j [7]:

• if |j| > jc, where jc = λv3/(9√3), then eq.(3) has one solution only, that we note φ0(j);
• if |j| < jc, then eq.(3) has the three solutions, one of which is a maximum and the two

others are the local minima relevant for the partition function

φ1 =

2v
√3
cos[π/3 − (1/3) arccos(j/jc)]
2v
√3
φ2 = −

cos[(1/3) arccos(j/jc)] .

In what follows we are looking at these two situations separately.

2.1

large source

For the situation where |j| > jc, the saddle point partition function is

Z (0)[j] = exp(cid:0)−V (4)Ubare(φ0) − V (4)jφ0(j)(cid:1) .

Since the source j is uniform, functional derivatives with respect to j are replaced by partial
derivatives with respect to V (4)j

where V (4) is the spacetime volume, such that the classical ﬁeld is

φc ≡

bare(φ0) + j)

∂φ0

+ φ0(j) = φ0(j) .

3

The saddle point eﬀective action is then

Γ(0)[φc] = W (0)[j] − V (4)jφc = V (4)Ubare(φc) ,

leading to the saddle point eﬀective potential

U (0)

ef f (φc) =

Γ(0)[φc]
V (4) = Ubare(φc) .

(8)

(9)

This expected result corresponds to the situation where φc is outside the minima v1, v2: the
saddle point approximation does not modify the bare potential.

2.2 Small source

For uniform ﬁelds, we have seen that the relevant source is actually k ≡ V (4)j, which will
allow to make an expansion in the small parameter ǫ ≡ (v4V (4))−1.
For a small source |j| < jcrit, the saddle point partition function takes into account the two
minima (4)

Z (0)[k] = exp(cid:0)−V (4)Ubare(φ1) − V (4)jφ1(cid:1) + exp(cid:0)−V (4)Ubare(φ2) − V (4)jφ2(cid:1) .

One then expands the arguments of the exponentials (n = 1, 2)

V (4)Ubare(φn) + V (4)jφn = V (4)j(cid:18)U ′

bare(vn)
= kvn + k2O(ǫ) ,

+ vn(cid:19) + V (4)O(j2)

∂φn

∂j (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0

(10)

(11)

and it is important to emphasise that this is is not an expansion in k, but in ǫ. Since φ1 and
φ2 have opposite signs, there is always one of the two exponentials in eq.(10) which is larger
than 1, whatever the sign of j is. As a consequence, one can use the large-volume expansion
(11) for the partition function1, with argument k,

Z (0)[k] ≃ 2 cosh(kv) + O(ǫ) = e−W (0)[k] .

Neglecting terms of order ǫ, the classical ﬁeld is then

φc =

∂W (0)

∂k

= −v tanh(kv) ,

and the latter relation can be inverted to obtain

k =

1
2v

ln(cid:18)v − φc

v + φc(cid:19) .

The saddle point eﬀective action is then

Γ(0)[φc] = − ln (2 cosh(kv)) − kφc ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

1The expansion in ǫ of the partition function would not be valid with a single minimum for the bare
potential: depending on the sign of the source j, the unique exponential could actually be smaller than the
term which is neglected.

(17)

The latter potential is convex, and matches the bare potential at φc = ±v, leading to an

(18)

which was found in [7], apart from the constant shift − ln 2/V (4), arising from an overall
factor 1/2 in the partition function deﬁned in [7]. In ﬂat spacetime, this shift is not relevant,
but in curved space time, if one imposes a vanishing vacuum energy in the bare potential,
this shift induces a vacuum energy in the eﬀective theory, for the true vacuum φc = 0.

One can note that the approach given in [7] is based on an expansion in the source up
to the order j4, and therefore φ4
c, but taking into account all the orders in (V (4))−1. The
approach adopted here, on the other hand, is based on an expansion in (V (4))−1, which has
the advantage to provide the resummation (17) to all orders in the classical ﬁeld φc.

The eﬀective potential (17) is universal in the sense that it depends on the bare vacuum
expectation value (vev) v only, and not on the explicit form of the bare potential. Finally, we
also note that, although continuous at φc = ±v, the eﬀective potential (17) is not analytical
at these points. This is because the limits φc → ±v correspond to the transition between
small and large source, where the saddle point approximation for the partition function is
not suﬃcient.

2.3 Maxwell construction

For ﬁnite spacetime volume, the true minimum of the system is at φc = 0, as a result
of a tunnel eﬀect between the two bare minima. In the limit of inﬁnite spacetime volume
V (4) → ∞ though, the eﬀective potential (17) is exactly ﬂat between the bare vacuua, the
true vacuum is not unique anymore, and SSB occurs. The vacuum of the system consists
then in a superposition of the two bare vacuua, with a weighted average φc which can be in
an arbitrary position between the bare vacuua.

This situation is similar to the so-called Maxwell construction in the study of the Van der
Waals equation of state, where naive isothermal curves in the plane (P, V ) present a region of
negative compressibility, which is not physical. The origin of the problem is that the Van der
Waals equation of state describes only one phase of the ﬂuid, and the solution to the problem
is to split the ﬂuid in two phases, liquid and vapour. There is then only one independent
state variable, and since the temperature T is already ﬁxed, the pressure is also ﬁxed at the
saturated vapour pressure PS(T ): the true isotherm trajectory features a plateau, avoiding
the negative compressibility.

This plateau is representative of the coexistence of two phases, and the classical analogy
in the present case is the following [14]: the ﬂat potential in the limit V (4) → ∞ corresponds
to the coexistence of bubbles of diﬀerent vacuua ±v, with arbitrary sizes.

5

3 One-loop corrections (zero temperature)

We show here that the overall picture is not modiﬁed by one-loop corrections, apart from
corrections to the mass scale v. Higher order loop corrections would have the same eﬀect,
and the existence of the volume-suppressed part of the eﬀective potential is expected to be
an exact result.

3.1 Large source

In the situation of large source described in subsection 2.1 for the saddle point approxi-
mation, the one-loop corrections are obtained by considering quadratic ﬂuctuations around
the minimum φ0(j)

is consistent as long as φ2
c > v2/3 only, which corresponds to the inﬂexion points of the
c → v2/3, and contains an imaginary part for
bare potential. It becomes singular when φ2
c < v2/3, which is the sign that some wrong step was taken.
φ2
c ≤ v2/3 is the cancellation of restoration
force for quantum ﬂuctuations ξ with momentum pµ satisfying p2 − λv2/6 + λφ2
0/2 < 0 in
the path integral (19), such that this partition function is not correct anymore. As shown in
the next subsection, the problem is cured by taking into account ﬂuctuations around both
saddle points of the partition function.
But the expression (20) can be used to calculate the one-loop correction v(1) to the mass
scale v, since it is perturbatively away from the bare vev and thus must satisfy v(1) > v/√3.
We have then

then v2 = 6µ2/λ, such that the correction in Λ2/v2 is actually proportional to λΛ2/µ2. As
we will see below, the expression (22) is also obtained from the one-loop eﬀective potential
for small source.

3.2 Small source

We show here that one-loop corrections do not change the functional form of the eﬀective
potential (17), but only redeﬁne the value of the mass scales vn. An important message is that
there is no imaginary part generated by quantum corrections, because of the interpolation
between the two vacuua.

One-loop quantum corrections to the eﬀective potential (17) are obtained after taking

tential U (1)
out(φc) is still mathematically consistent
for v2/3 < φ2
in (φc) (we neglect
in this discussion the corrections to the bare vacuua). The reason is that an eﬀective poten-
tial which is both convex and diﬀerentiable can be obtained only if the volume-suppressed
part U (1)
in (φc) holds in the whole range between the two bare vacuua. This is conﬁrmed in
the saddle point approximation by a Wilsonian construction of the eﬀective potential, which
takes into account non-trivial saddle points in each inﬁnitesimal blocking step [15].

At ﬁnite temperature T = β −1, the one-loop analysis is similar, besides the fact that the
integration over frequencies p0 is replaced the summation over discrete Matsubara modes

therefore identical to the one described in section 2, with the replacement V (4) → βV (3), where
V (3) is the space volume. In what follows we therefore directly go to one-loop corrections.

We note that the zero-temperature correction is twice the one obtained in eq.(22), which is
due to a diﬀerent regularisation of the loop integral. Indeed, at ﬁnite temperature, there is
no restriction on the amplitude of the Matsubara modes, whereas at zero temperature the
integration over frequencies is restricted by the cut oﬀ.
One then deﬁnes the renormalised zero-temperature mass scale v0 by

4.2 Small source

The eﬀective potential (31), derived for large source, is valid for |φc| ≥ vT . As discussed
in section 3, for |φc| < vT , quantum corrections consist in replacing the mass scale v by
its renormalised value, which is vT here, in the volume-suppressed eﬀective potential (17).
Replacing also V (4) by βV (3), the eﬀective potential for |φc| < vT is then:

4.3 Zeroth order phase transition

The eﬀective potential features the volume-suppressed part (40) in the interval [−vT , vT ]
as long as T < TC. As the temperature increases and reaches the critical temperature
T → Tc, this interval shrinks and vanishes: the eﬀective potential (31) becomes then valid
for all the values of the classical ﬁeld. In both temperature regimes though, the ground state
is φc = 0, provided the volume V (3) is ﬁnite. The limit T → Tc thus does not corresponds to
a spontaneous symmetry breaking for the vacuum, but rather to a diﬀerent scaling with the
volume V (3).

More speciﬁcally, let us study the eﬀective mass, the free energy and the entropy, deﬁned

in the ground state φc = 0 (or vanishing source j = 0):

where the Boltzmann constant is set to 1. The transition is of zeroth order, since the free
energy F is discontinuous:

• For T < Tc, the eﬀective potential features the volume-suppressed part (40) in the
interval [−vT , vT ]. The eﬀective renormalised mass, deﬁned above the true vacuum φc = 0,
is given by

and diverges at the critical temperature, if the volume V (3) is ﬁnite. This divergence could
be an artifact arising from the weakness of the saddle point approximation for |φc| → vT ,
and a more detailed study would be necessary to investigate this limit.
The free energy and the entropy, obtained from the potential (40), read

F< = V (3)U (1)
S< = ln 2 ,

in T (0) = −T ln 2

(48)

and are not proportional to the volume, as a consequence of the volume-suppressed form of
the eﬀective potential (40). The expression (48) for S is the Boltzmann entropy for a system
with two degenerate microscopic states, which correspond to the two bare vacuua.
Due to the expressions (48) under the critical temperature, both the pressure and the internal
energy vanish in the ground state. Therefore, in the low temperature regime T < Tc, the
thermodynamical properties of the system are frozen, due to the speciﬁc form (40) of the
eﬀective potential, where only the parameter vT is modiﬁed by quantum corrections. Also, the
eﬀective potential (40) has been derived independently of a large-temperature assumption,
such that its features should remain valid for all temperatures below Tc.

5 Conclusion: physical relevance?

As we have seen, convexity arises from the interplay of the two degenerate minima of the
bare potential, which both have to be taken into account in the deﬁnition of the partition
function. This is the reason why the one-loop potential (20) is not correct for the whole
range of classical ﬁelds. Convexity could be spoiled though, if Parity symmetry is broken,
such that the degenerate vacuua are not equivalent and one vacuum only should be taken
into account. Depending on the system under study, one therefore has two possibilities:
(a) If there is no preferred vacuum, then the full partition function should be used and the
eﬀective potential is necessarily convex;
(b) If some mechanism imposes one speciﬁc vacuum, then one considers a “partial” partition
function, which integrates ﬂuctuations over this vacuum only, and convexity of the eﬀective
potential should not be expected.

We list here few relevant possibilities for related studies:

• Dark Matter (DM): an alternative to massive DM particles involves ultra-light scalar
particles, forming a Bose-Einstein condensate which plays the role of DM halo [17].
In order to obtain a coherence length of the size of a typical galactic halo, the mass
of these particles is typically 10−23 eV. It has been shown in [18] that such a mass is
provided by the eﬀective potential (18), where v is the Higgs vev and V (4) = L4, with
L the particle horizon at the time of the Electroweak phase transition. A common
mechanism with the Higgs mechanism is therefore proposed, which could explain how
such a small mass can arise from a typical Standard Model (SM) mass scale;

11

• Axion Physics:

starting with a cosine bare potential, the sum over the inﬁnity of
degenerate vacuua, for the full partition function, leads to a completely ﬂat eﬀective
potential (see Appendix C). Indeed, the only possibility for the eﬀective potential to be
convex, periodic and diﬀerentiable is to be constant. Assuming a cosine bare potential,
it has actually been shown in [19] that a constant eﬀective potential is consistent with
an exact self-consistent equation for the eﬀective potential, in the form of a diﬀerential
Schwinger-Dyson equation. It is not clear, though, if the coupling of axions with SM
particles would force the axion ﬁeld to oscillate above one speciﬁc vacuum, avoiding a
ﬂat eﬀective potential for the axion, but this question could lead to new axion studies;

• Kibble mechanism [20]: the description of transition between a trivial vacuum and SSB
in the cosmological context, when the temperature of the Universe decreases, could be
modiﬁed if convexity is required. The Kibble mechanism is based on the description of
a complex scalar ﬁeld though, coupled to a gauge ﬁeld, such that quantisation should in
principle not be performed with the full partition function, and the present construction
of the convex eﬀective potential might not be relevant. In addition, cosmological studies
involve a time evolution, and one might have to treat the present equilibrium ﬁeld theory
results with care;

• Higgs vacuum instability: the tunneling between diﬀerent vacuua of the Higgs potential
leads, for inﬁnite time, to the true vacuum. This is consistent with a convex eﬀective
potential, for which the unique minimum is located at this non-vanishing vacuum. This
situation involves both convexity and a non-trivial vev though, unlike in the present
article, and further studies are necessary to understand this connection.

The question of using the full partition function or only a restricted partition function
is also discussed in [13], and is not trivial to answer. Further studies in this direction are
required, and could open a new set of models for Physics Beyond the SM.

Appendix A: Convexity of the eﬀective potential

Starting from the bare action S[φ], the (Euclidean) partition function is

Z[j] = Z D[φ] exp(cid:18)−S[φ] −Zx

jφ(cid:19) ,

where j(x) is the source. The connected graph generating functional is then

from which the classical ﬁeld is deﬁned as

W [j] = − ln(Z[j]) ,

φc(x) =

δW
δj(x)

= hφ(x)i ,

(51)

where

h· · ·i ≡

1

Z Z D[φ](· · · ) exp(cid:18)−S[φ] −Z jφ(cid:19) ,

(52)

The one-particle irreducible (1PI) graph generating functional Γ[φc] is deﬁned as the Legendre
transform of W [j]

Γ[φc] = W [j] −Zx

jφc ,

(53)

where j should be seen a functional of φc, after inverting the deﬁnition (51). From the
deﬁnition of the Legendre transform Γ, one can write the equation of motion for the dressed
system as

δΓ
δφc

= Zx

δW

which shows that the second functional derivative of W is necessarily negative, as the opposite
of a variance squared. As a consequence, and given the relation (54), the second functional
Its derivative-
derivative of Γ is positive: the 1PI eﬀective action is a convex functional.
ef f (φc) ≥ 0 every-
independent part, the 1PI eﬀective potential, is thus a convex function: U ′′
where.

Appendix B: (no) Contribution of bounce saddle points

The aim of this appendix is to show that the contribution of non-homogeneous saddle
points is negligible compared to the uniform conﬁgurations considered in this article, from
which the convex potential is obtained. In what follows, we use several aspects described in
[11] for the calculation of tunneling rates.

Any kink-like saddle point of the partition function, which does not depend on at least one
of the 4 Euclidean spacetime coordinates, gives rise to a kinetic term which is proportional to
the size of spacetime in the corresponding dimension. As a consequence such a conﬁguration
is negligible compared to the two uniform saddle points, for which the kinetic term vanish.
A non-homogeneous saddle point φb which could potentially contribute to the partition
function therefore necessarily has a ﬁnite 4-dimensional extension, it depends on the O(4)-

invariant argument r = px2 + y2 + z2 + t2, and reaches the two diﬀerent minima of the bare
potential for r = 0 and r → ∞. Thus the limits t → ±∞ correspond to r → ∞ for the ﬁeld
φb, which then starts from its initial value v (t → −∞), goes to its intermediate value ≃ −v
(t = r = 0) and “bounces” back to its initial value v (t → +∞). In the absence of source,
the bounce satisﬁes the equation of motion

r3 ∂r(r3∂rφb) =

φb(φ2

(56)

and corresponds to a 4-dimensional bubble of arbitrary radius R. In the thin bubble wall
limit Rv√λ >> 1, an approximate family of solution of eq.(56), parametrised by the radius
R, is given by

φb = v tanh(cid:18)r − R

r0 (cid:19) ,

r0 =

√12
v√λ

.

In this approximation, the bounce action is dominated by the kinetic term and reads

π2√λ

B ≡ S[φb] ≃

6

(vR)3 >> 1 ,

which thus gives a negligible contribution to the partition function. As explained more
generally in [11], the radius of the bounce solutions which minimises the bounce action is
proportional to the inverse of the diﬀerence in energy ∆U corresponding to the two vacuua.
The bounce action B is then proportional to (∆U)−3, and becomes inﬁnite in the symmetric
limit we consider here, therefore not contributing to the saddle point approximation for the
partition function.
The bounce solution is actually invariant under spacetime translation, and one should sum
over the positions of the centre of the bounce. As shown in [11], the contribution of n bounces,
taking into account the diﬀerent locations of the centres of each bubble, leads to the ﬁnal
contribution to the partition function of the form

Zb ≃ exp(e−B) − 1 .

(59)

The latter expression does not take into account the case n = 0, and is therefore valid for
one bounce at least. As can be seen, when ∆U → 0 and thus B → ∞, then Zb → 0: bounces
do not play a role in the situation of a symmetric bare potential.

Appendix C: Cosine bare potential

We consider here the bare potential, which is twice diﬀerentiable,

Ubare(φ) = M 4 [1 + cos(φ/f )]

Ubare(φ) =

M 4[φ2 − (2N + 1)2π2f 2]2

8(2N + 1)2π2f 4

for

for

|φ| ≤ (2N + 1)πf
|φ| ≥ (2N + 1)πf ,

(60)

where M and f are two mass scales. This potential leads to a converging path integral, since
it provides quartic restoration forces for large ﬂuctuations |φ| >> (2N + 1)f . For ﬁnite N
we follow the same steps as those shown in section 2.2 to ﬁnd the classical ﬁeld in terms of
the source k = V (4)j. In order to recover the full cosine potential, we will then take the limit
N → ∞, where it is shown that the eﬀective potential becomes ﬂat.
The minima of the bare potential (60) are given by φn = (2n + 1)πf , for the integers
|n| ≤ N. The saddle point partition function is then, up to terms proportional to (V (4))−1,

(64)

which, in the limit where N → ∞ implies k = 0. Although the source is in principle a free
parameter, we can see that the limit N → ∞ implies a strong constraint on the system,
which shows that the one-to-one mapping between the source and the classical ﬁeld is lost.
