Abstract—Device-to-Device (D2D) communications can ofﬂoad
the trafﬁc and boost the throughput of cellular networks. By
caching ﬁles at users, content delivery trafﬁc can be ofﬂoaded
via D2D links, if a helper user are willing to send the cached
ﬁle to the user who requests the ﬁle. Yet it is unclear how much
energy needs to be consumed at a helper user to support the
trafﬁc ofﬂoading. In this paper, we strive to ﬁnd the minimal
energy consumption required at a helper user to maximize the
amount of ofﬂoaded trafﬁc. To this end, we introduce a user-
centric proactive caching policy that can control the energy cost
for a helper user to convey a ﬁle, and then optimize the caching
policy to maximize the ofﬂoaded trafﬁc. To reduce the energy
during transmission, we optimize the transmit power to minimize
the energy consumed by a helper to send a ﬁle. We analyze the
relationship between trafﬁc ofﬂoading and energy cost with the
optimized caching policy and transmit power by numerical and
simulation results, which demonstrate that a signiﬁcant amount
of trafﬁc can be ofﬂoaded with affordable energy costs.

I. INTRODUCTION

Device-to-device (D2D) communications is a promising
approach to ofﬂoad the trafﬁc and boost the throughput of
cellular networks, whose typical user cases include content
distribution, gaming and relaying [1].

The lion’s share of cellular trafﬁc is video distribution,
which will generate more than 69% of mobile data trafﬁc by
2019 [2]. Nonetheless, a large amount of trafﬁc is generated
by a few contents. On the other hand, the storage of mobile
devices grows rapidly with low cost. Motivated by these facts,
cache-enabled D2D communications was proposed in [3, 4] to
ofﬂoad the trafﬁc of video transmission. Without caching at the
devices, the users need to fetch their desired content via base
station (BS) from a remote server. By pre-caching popular ﬁles
at users during the off-peak time according to their possible
interests, the desired ﬁle of a user can be transmitted via D2D
links by the users in proximity when the actual request arrives.
Such a proactive caching policy largely alleviates the burden at
the BSs during the peak time. To maximize the trafﬁc ofﬂoaded
by D2D links, the policy to proactively cache popular ﬁles at
mobile devices was optimized in [5], and a distributed reactive
caching mechanism was designed in [6].

Different from the D2D use cases of supporting peer-to-peer
services such as gaming, where the users acting as transmitters

are willing to send messages to the destination users [7],
ofﬂoading the content delivery trafﬁc by cache-enabled D2D
communications needs the help of other users who have cached
the desired ﬁles but are not obligated to act as helpers to
transmit the ﬁles. Due to the limited battery capacity, a natural
question from a helper user in such a network is: “why should
I spend energy of my battery to provide you with faster video
download? [3]” This makes the energy consumption at a helper
user a big concern in D2D communications with caching.
Considering the large potential in trafﬁc ofﬂoading by cache-
enabled D2D communications, it is an urgent task to evaluate
the energy consumed at a helper user to deliver the ﬁles. In
particular, characterizing the required energy consumption at
a helper to maximize the trafﬁc ofﬂoading for the network is
an important problem.

In previous research efforts [3–6], the energy costs at helper
users are never considered. On one hand, maximal transmit
power is always used to deliver the ﬁles. On the other hand, by
dividing the users in a cell into clusters and assuming that only
the users within a cluster can establish D2D links, the optimal
caching policy proposed in [5] cannot maximize the ofﬂoaded
trafﬁc in a cell, and the energy cost for a helper is high. This
is because when a user is only allowed to communicate with
the users within its cluster, it can not fetch the ﬁle from the
nearest helper in adjacent cluster who can convey the ﬁle with
low transmit power.

In this paper, we strive to investigate the energy cost
to maximize the ofﬂoaded trafﬁc.
at a helper user spent
Toward this goal, we ﬁrst introduce a user-centric proactive
caching policy, where only the users within a collaboration
distance of a user can serve as helpers. We optimize the
caching policy to maximize trafﬁc ofﬂoading with a given
collaboration distance and the user demands statistics. When
the collaboration distance is large, the probability that the users
can fetch their desired contents via D2D links is high, and then
more trafﬁc can be ofﬂoaded. However, since the possible D2D
link distance increases, the energy cost of a helper user also
grows. By setting the collaboration distance according to the
affordable energy cost of each helper, such a caching policy
helps reduce the energy for transmission. Then, we optimize
the transmit power for a helper to send the requested ﬁle to
minimize the energy spent by the helper. Finally, we analyze
the tradeoff between trafﬁc ofﬂoading and energy costs for
the D2D network with optimized caching policy and transmit

power with numerical and simulation results.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

Consider one cell in cellular networks where user location
follows a Poisson Point Process (PPP) with density λ. Each
single antenna user has local cache to store ﬁles and acts as
helper. If a helper establishes a D2D link with a D2D receiver
(DR),
it becomes a D2D transmitter (DT). For notational
simplicity, we assume that each user stores one ﬁle as in
[4]. The BS is aware of the cached ﬁles of the users and
coordinates the D2D communications.

We consider a static content catalog including Nf ﬁles that
all users in the cell may request, where the ﬁles are indexed
according to the popularity, and the 1st ﬁle is the most popular
ﬁle. Each ﬁle is with size of F Bits. Each user requests a ﬁle
from the catalog independently. The probability that the ith ﬁle
is requested by a user is assumed to follow Zipf distribution,
which is

pr(i) = i−β/

k−β,

Fig. 1.

Illustration for a cache-enabled D2D network

Since transmitting to a far away DR spends more energy of
a DT, we introduce a user-centric caching policy to control
the energy for transmission: a helper user will send the
ﬁle it cached to the user requesting the ﬁle only if their
distance is smaller than a given value rc, called collaboration
distance. We consider a probabilistic caching policy, where
each user caches a ﬁle according to a rc-dependent caching
distribution, i.e., the probability that the ith ﬁle is cached at
users, i = 1,··· , Nf . All users in the cell cached with the ith
ﬁle constitute a user set, called the ith helper set. In practice,
the ﬁles can be proactively downloaded by the BS during the
off-peak time.

The users with distance r less than rc are called adjacent
users, as shown in Fig. 1. If a user can ﬁnd its requested
ﬁle in the local caches of its adjacent users, a D2D link will
be established between the user and its nearest adjacent user
cached with the requested ﬁle to convey the ﬁle. Otherwise,
the user needs to fetch the ﬁle from the BS. The probability
that the requests from the users can be served via D2D links is

called trafﬁc ofﬂoading ratio, which reﬂects how much trafﬁc
can be ofﬂoaded by D2D communications.

III. OPTIMAL CACHING POLICY

In this section, we optimize the caching distribution to

maximize the ofﬂoading ratio.

Denote the probability that the ith ﬁle is cached at users
as pc(i). Then, the locations of the users who belong to the
ith helper set follow a PPP distribution with density λpc(i)
[9]. Thus, the probability that a user requesting the ith ﬁle
can ﬁnd its desired ﬁle in the cache of any user within the
collaboration distance rc is

pf (i) = 1 − e−λpc(i)πr2
c .

(2)

Then, the ofﬂoading ratio with given caching distribution and
collaboration distance can be obtained from (1) and (2) as

po(pc(i), rc) =

pr(i)(1 − e−λpc(i)πr2
c ).

(3)

i=1

The optimal caching distribution that maximizes the ofﬂoad-

ing ratio can be found from the following problem

each user can randomly select a ﬁle to cache according to
the probability p∗
c (i). Then, the trafﬁc in the network can be
maximally ofﬂoaded. Because such a caching policy depends
on rc, the possible D2D link distance and hence the energy
spent by a helper can be controlled by the pre-determined
value of collaboration distance.

IV. ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR TRAFFIC OFFLOADING
In this section, we investigate the energy consumed by
each DT for ofﬂoading the trafﬁc by the cache-enabled D2D
communications. To this end, we ﬁrst optimize the transmit
power for conveying a ﬁle to minimize the energy consumption
at each DT. Then, we evaluate the average energy consumed at
each DT to transmit a ﬁle via D2D links based on the optimal
transmit power and optimal caching policy.

Once a D2D link is established, the DT can transmit its
cached ﬁle to the DR who requests the ﬁle. Considering
the random user requests, random caching and random user
locations, it is reasonable to treat the interference among the
D2D links as noise. Then, the signal to interference plus noise
ratio (SINR) at the DR can be expressed as

γ(r) =

where Pt is the transmit power at the DT, σ2
0 is the variance of
white Gaussian noise and interference, h and r are respectively
the channel coefﬁcient and distance between the DT and the
DR with h following zero mean complex Gaussian distribution
with unit variance, and α is the path loss exponent.

Considering that 1 + γ(r) approximately follows Gamma
distribution [11], the average data rate with respect to small
scale channel fading can be derived as

By using the ﬁrst order approximation [12], the average time

With Prop. 2, the optimal transmit power P ∗

t (r) can be
obtained efﬁciently. By substituting P ∗
t (r) to (10), the minimal
energy consumption for the D2D link with distance r can be
obtained as E∗

To evaluate minimal energy cost for a DT to transmit a ﬁle
over D2D links with different distances, we need to obtain the
distribution of r when the optimal caching policy is employed.
Similar to (2),
the cumulative distribution function of the
distance between the DR requesting the ith ﬁle and its nearest
DT in the ith helper set with optimized caching policy can
be obtained as F (p∗

probability density function of the D2D link distance can be

V. SIMULATION AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of the approxima-
tions and the energy consumption at a DT for ofﬂoading via
simulation and numerical results.

To show the impact of the optimized caching policy and
transmit power, we consider uniform caching policy (i.e., all
users select a ﬁle from the catalog uniformly) as a caching
baseline, and a transmit policy always using the maximal
transmit power as the transmission baseline.

We consider a square cell with side length 1000m. The
users’ location follows PPP distribution with λ = 0.03, then
there are 2 ∼ 3 users in a 10m×10m area. The path-loss model
is 37.6+36.8 log10(r), where r is the distance of D2D link [5].
0 = −95 dBm. The ﬁle catalog is with
W = 20 MHz and σ2
Nf = 1000 ﬁles, where each ﬁle is with size of 30 Mbytes
(i.e., a typical video size on the Youtube website [3]). The

parameter of Zipf distribution β = 1. The maximal transmit
power at DT is Pmax = 23 dBm, the ampliﬁer efﬁciency
η = 0.2, and the circuit power is Pc = 115.9 mW [13].

To reﬂect how much average energy consumed at a DT to
transmit a ﬁle occupies the battery capacity, we evaluate an
energy cost ratio as follows,

¯pE =

¯Ec(rc)
3.6V0Q

,

(15)

where Q is the battery capacity in mAh, and V0 is the operating
voltage in V.

The operating voltage at user is set as V0 = 4V and the

battery capacity Q = 1800 mAh (typical for iPhone 6).

Fig. 2. Optimal caching distribution and optimal transmit power

In Fig. 2, we show the optimal caching distribution and the
optimal transmit power versus the D2D link distance r. We
can see from Fig. 2(a) that the optimal caching distribution
is similar to the Zipf distribution, where the ﬁle with smaller
index (i.e., more popular) has higher probability to be cached,
which agrees with the intuition. With the increase of β and
λ, the caching probability for popular ﬁles increases. We can
see from Fig. 2(b) that the optimal transmit power for very
small and large D2D link distance r is the maximal transmit
power. This is because when r is small, the transmit duration
can be reduced and the energy cost can be minimized with
Pmax. When r is large, the circuit power and transmit power
are balanced to minimize the energy cost with Pmax.

Fig. 3. Ofﬂoading ratio and average energy costs versus rc, β = 1 λ = 0.03,
S-Simulation results, N-Numerical results

In Fig. 3, we show the ofﬂoading ratio and the energy cost
ratio versus the collaboration distance rc, where the energy

consumption at each DT is computed for the cache-enabled
D2D communications with optimized caching distribution.
The simulation results are close to numerical results when
rc < 100 m, which indicates that the approximated energy
consumption is accurate for smaller collaboration distance. As
expected, the optimized caching policy can ofﬂoad more trafﬁc
than the baseline. Even when rc = 10 m, more than 20% trafﬁc
can be ofﬂoaded with the optimal caching policy. When rc
is large, e.g., rc = 200 m, the ofﬂoading ratios of both the
optimal and baseline caching policy approach to one, since
adjacent users for each user is abundant to cache almost all the
ﬁles in the catalog. The optimized transmit power consumes
less energy than always using the maximal transmit power,
especially when the collaboration distance is large. From this
ﬁgure, we can pre-determine the collaboration distance to
control the energy cost at each helper into an affordable level.

Fig. 4. Ofﬂoading ratio and average energy costs versus β and λ, rc = 100m
In Fig. 4, we show the ofﬂoading ratio with optimal caching
policy and the energy cost ratio with optimal transmit power
versus Zipf distribution parameter β and user density λ. With
the increase of λ, a user has more adjacent users, therefore, the
probability that a requested ﬁle can be transmitted via D2D
link increases. As a result, the energy cost ratio increases. The
ofﬂoading ratio increases with β, and grows rapidly for heavy
trafﬁc load. However, with the growth of β, the energy cost
ratio increases when λ is small but decreases when λ is large.
In Fig. 5(a), we show the tradeoff between the ofﬂoading
ratio and the energy cost ratio with different caching and
power control policies, where the ofﬂoading ratio is adjusted
by changing the collaboration distance rc from 10m to 100m.
We can see that with the optimized caching policy and transmit
power, the energy cost ratio increases with ofﬂoading ratio
slowly, and is much lower than other policies. To ofﬂoad
80% trafﬁc, the energy consumption at each DT only occupies
0.02% battery capacity. This suggests that D2D communica-
tions with caching will be cost-efﬁcient for ofﬂoading if the
caching and transmission policies are judiciously designed.

In the sequel, we show the impact of several key factors on
the tradeoff between the ofﬂoading ratio and the energy cost
ratio with the optimized caching policy and transmit power.
In Fig. 5(b), we show the impact of interference level. As
expected, with the increase of interference level, to achieve the
same ofﬂoading ratio, more energy needs to be consumed at

of controlling the interference among D2D links.

In Fig. 5(c), we show the impact of the users density λ. As λ
increases, the number of adjacent users of each user increases,
hence less energy cost
is consumed to achieve the same
ofﬂoading ratio, resulting in the reduction of the energy cost
ratio. Moreover, the increasing speed of energy cost with the
ofﬂoading ratio becomes slowly when λ is large. This suggests
that it is more efﬁcient in terms of the energy cost of each DT
for ofﬂoading by cache-enabled D2D communications in the
network with heavy trafﬁc load.

In Fig. 5(d), we show the impact of Zipf distribution β.
As expected, with the increase of β, less energy is consumed
to achieve a given ofﬂoading ratio. To achieve an 80% trafﬁc
ofﬂoading ratio, the energy cost of each DT for the scenario
with β = 1 is only 25% of that with β = 0.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we strive to evaluate the energy consumed
at a helper user to support trafﬁc ofﬂoading for a network
by cache-enabled D2D communications. We ﬁrst optimized a
user-centric proactive caching policy, with which the trafﬁc
can be maximally ofﬂoaded and the energy consumed for
transmission can be controlled by a collaboration distance.
We then optimized the transmit power to convey a ﬁle via
D2D link, aimed to minimize the energy consumption at the

the objective function in (11) can be rewritten as

Denote g(y) = y log2(y) ln 2 − y − , where y = 1 + az, 1 <
y ≤ 1 + aPmax (cid:44) y0, and  = r−αηPc
− 1. We can see that if
g(y) > 0, then f(cid:48)(z) > 0, and vice versa.
By taking the ﬁrst-order derivative of g(y), we obtain
g(cid:48)(y) = log2(y) ln 2 > 0 due to y > 1. Therefore, g(y) is a
increasing function of y, when y → 1, g(y) → 0. If g(y0) ≤ 0,
g(y) is always less than zero since 1 < y < y0, then f (z) will
be a decreasing function, i.e., f (z) achieves its minimum when
z = Pmax. Otherwise, f (z) ﬁrst decreases and then increases,
and achieves its minimum when g(y) = 0.

In summary, if g(1 + Pmaxr−α

The ﬁrst inequality comes from changing the integral upper

increasing function of r and by taking the partial derivative
of ∆po ≥ 0 with respect to rc. With tedious derivation, we
can show that there exist ξ, when rc < ξ, ∆po ≤ 0, resulting
