Moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces∗

Justin Sawon

February, 2016

Abstract

In this survey article we describe moduli spaces of simple, stable, and semistable
sheaves on K3 surfaces, following the work of Mukai, O’Grady, Huybrechts, Yoshioka,
and others. We also describe some recent developments, including applications to
the study of Chow rings of K3 surfaces, determination of the ample and nef cones of
irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds, and moduli spaces of Bridgeland stable
complexes of sheaves.

Introduction

In the 60s, moduli spaces of vector bundles on curves were much studied, following Mum-
ford’s general construction using Geometric Invariant Theory. Attention then turned to
vector bundles on surfaces and higher dimensional varieties. Several new features immedi-
ately arose. A vector bundle on a curve has two numerical invariants, the rank r and degree
d (equivalently, the ﬁrst Chern class c1), and the construction of moduli spaces as GIT
quotients leads naturally to the deﬁnition of stability in terms of the slope µ = d/r. Slope
stability extends to higher dimensions, but by using the additional numerical invariants
(higher Chern classes c2, etc.) Gieseker was led to another notion of stability. While slope
stability is easier to work with when manipulating vector bundles, Gieseker stability allows
for a more general construction of moduli spaces; of course, these two notions of stability
are closely related, and in many cases equivalent. Another diﬀerence in higher dimensions
is that, unlike on smooth curves, torsion free coherent sheaves are not automatically locally
free. Thus to obtain compact moduli spaces, one must consider not just vector bundles but
also torsion free sheaves.

Moduli spaces of sheaves on P2 and on higher dimensional projective spaces were very
explicitly described in the late 70s, partly motivated by the relation to Yang-Mills instan-
tons on R4 and S4. The geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves on other speciﬁc surfaces
were also studied, notably for K3 and abelian surfaces by Mukai in the 1980s. Such moduli
spaces reﬂect the geometry of the underlying surface; they can be used to reveal proper-
ties of the surface, or they may be studied as interesting spaces in their own right. For
instance, Mukai proved that moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces are examples of holo-
morphic symplectic manifolds, i.e., higher dimensional analogues of K3 surfaces, or from a
diﬀerential geometric perspective, hyperk¨ahler manifolds. These moduli spaces have been
intensely studied ever since, both for what they tell us about K3 surfaces (and their curves,
linear systems, Chow groups, etc.) and as test cases for uncovering the structure of general

holomorphic symplectic manifolds. Another impetus for studying moduli spaces of sheaves
on surfaces, from the mid-80s to the mid-90s, was Donaldson’s fundamental work on the
topology of smooth four-manifolds via moduli spaces of Yang-Mills instantons. Because of
the Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence, which gives a Hermitian-Einstein connection on any
stable bundle, Donaldson’s polynomial invariants for algebraic surfaces can be computed
using moduli spaces of stable bundles.

In this article we survey moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces.

In Section 2 we
recall simpleness, slope stability, and Gieseker stability for torsion free coherent sheaves,
and describe how these notions are related. We describe some general properties of moduli
spaces of simple, stable, and semistable sheaves on K3 surfaces. We end the section with
a short discussion of the Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence. Much of the material in this
section remains valid for arbitrary projective surfaces, and almost every result for K3 surfaces
has an analogous result for abelian surfaces. The rest of the article describes some recent
developments and applications of sheaves on K3 surfaces, and their moduli spaces.
In
Section 3 we review work of Beauville, Voisin, Huybrechts, and O’Grady on the Chow ring
of a K3 surface.
In Section 4 we discuss Hassett and Tschinkel’s conjectural description
of the Mori cone of curves on a holomorphic symplectic manifold, which determines the
ample and nef cones, and what is known for moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces. In
Section 5 we give a brief description of Bridgeland stability conditions on derived categories,
and present some applications of these ideas to moduli spaces of sheaves and complexes of
sheaves on K3 surfaces due to Bayer and Macr`ı.

For the reader interested in pursuing these topics further, we recommend the excellent
survey articles by Mukai [34] and Yoshioka [51], which, like this article, concentrate mainly
on moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces. A more general introduction to moduli spaces
of sheaves on algebraic surfaces can be found in the books of Friedman [13], Huybrechts and
Lehn [20], and Le Potier [24].

2 Simple and stable sheaves, and their moduli spaces

2.1 Simple sheaves

Let X be a K3 surface. When considering families of holomorphic bundles or coherent
sheaves on X, we ﬁx the underlying topological type of the bundles or sheaves. For this
purpose, it is convenient to introduce the following lattice.

Deﬁnition The Mukai lattice of X is

Hev(X, Z) := H0(X, Z) ⊕ H2(X, Z) ⊕ H4(X, Z)

with the pairing deﬁned by

hv, wi := ZX

−v0w4 + v2w2 − v4w0.

2.1 Simple sheaves

The Mukai vector of a sheaf E on X is deﬁned to be

v(E) := ch(E)Td

1
2

X = (cid:18)r, c1,

c2
1
2

− c2 + r(cid:19) ,

where c1 and c2 are the Chern classes of E, and r its rank. We call E a simple sheaf if
Hom(E, E) ∼= C.

Under fairly general conditions, moduli of coherent sheaves exists only as Artin stacks.
By adding the simpleness condition, we obtain moduli spaces that are algebraic spaces
(possibly non-Hausdorﬀ). For simple sheaves on K3 surfaces, Mukai proved more.

Theorem 1 (Mukai [32]) Fix an element v = (v0, v2, v4) in Hev(X, Z) with v2 lying in the
N´eron-Severi group NS(X) of X. The moduli space Spl(v) of simple sheaves E on X with
v(E) = v is smooth of dimension hv, vi+ 2. Moreover, Spl(v) admits a closed non-degenerate
holomorphic two-form.

Proof We give a rough sketch of the argument and refer to [32] for details (see also [33]
and [34]). The Zariski tangent space of Spl(v) at E is isomorphic to Ext1(E, E). Riemann-
Roch gives

χ(E, E) = dimHom(E, E) − dimExt1(E, E) + dimExt2(E, E)

= ZX

ch(E ∨)ch(E)TdX

= −hv, vi.

Now Hom(E, E) ∼= C is one-dimensional, and so is Ext2(E, E) ∼= Hom(E, E)∨, by Serre duality
and ωX ∼= OX . Therefore

dimExt1(E, E) = hv, vi + 2.

This gives the dimension, though we still have to establish smoothness. In general, the ob-
struction to deforming a sheaf E lies in Ext2(E, E). One can prove that taking the trace gives
the obstruction in H2(OX ) to deforming the line bundle det E. But there is no obstruction
to deforming a line bundle on a K3 surface; indeed, line bundles are rigid. Now for a simple
sheaf E, the map

Ext2(E, E)

tr−→ H2(OX )

is an isomorphism, as it is the dual of

H0(OX ) ∼= C −→ Hom(E, E).

Thus the vanishing of the obstruction to deforming det E implies the vanishing of the ob-
struction to deforming E itself, and Spl(v) is smooth at E.

A bilinear pairing on the tangent space Ext1(E, E) is given by composing and then taking

the trace:

Ext1(E, E) × Ext1(E, E) −→ Ext2(E, E)

tr−→ H2(OX ) ∼= C

If a ∈ Ext1(E, E) then the pairing of a with itself gives the obstruction to deforming E in
the direction a, as described above. Since this obstruction vanishes for simple sheaves E,
the pairing is skew-symmetric. For holomorphicity and closedness of the resulting two-form
on Spl(v) see [34], page 154.

2 SIMPLE AND STABLE SHEAVES, AND THEIR MODULI SPACES

2.2 Stability and semistability

While the moduli space Spl(v) has some nice properties, it is usually non-Hausdorﬀ, and for
this reason we consider instead stable sheaves. Let (X, H) be a polarized K3 surface, i.e.,
H is an ample divisor on X.

Deﬁnition The slope of a torsion free coherent sheaf E is deﬁned to be

µ(E) :=

c1(E).H
rank E

.

A torsion free coherent sheaf E is µ-stable (respectively µ-semistable) if µ(F ) < µ(E) (re-
spectively µ(F ) ≤ µ(E)) for all coherent subsheaves F ⊂ E with 0 < rank F < rank E.

Remark This is also known as Mumford-Takemoto stability [42] and slope stability.

Deﬁnition The normalized Hilbert polynomial of a torsion free coherent sheaf E is deﬁned
to be

pH,E (n) :=

rank E

χ(E ⊗ H n)

.

A torsion free coherent sheaf E is stable (respectively semistable) if pH,F (n) < pH,E (n)
(respectively pH,F (n) ≤ pH,E (n)) for n ≫ 0 for all proper subsheaves F ⊂ E.

Remark This is also known as Gieseker stability [14] and Maruyama stability [28]. (To
emphasize the dependence on the choice of polarization, H-stability is also used; but care
needs to be taken since H-stable sometimes means µ-stable with respect to H.) In addition,
Simpson [41] generalized the notion of stability to pure-dimensional sheaves.

Lemma 2

1. Stable sheaves are simple.

2. We have the following implications:

E is µ-stable ⇒ E is stable ⇒ E is semistable ⇒ E is µ-semistable

3. If the rank of E and divisibility of c1(E) in H2(X, Z) are coprime, and H is v-general
where v = v(E), then E is µ-semistable implies E is µ-stable. (So in this case, all four
notions of stability and semistability in 2 are equivalent for E.)

4. If v(E) ∈ Hev(X, Z) is primitive and H is v-general, then E is semistable implies E is

stable.

Remark For each v ∈ Hev(X, Z) there are hyperplanes in the ample cone of X known as
walls. We call an ample divisor H v-general if it does not lie on any of these walls.

Proof Let E be stable and let a ∈ Hom(E, E) be non-zero. Suppose that a is not an
isomorphism. Denote by F and G the kernel and image of a, respectively. Then both F and
G are proper subsheaves of E, so pH,F (n) < pH,E (n) and pH,G(n) < pH,E(n) for n ≫ 0, by
the stability of E. Now from the short exact sequence

0 −→ F −→ E −→ G −→ 0

we get

χ(E ⊗ H n) = χ(F ⊗ H n) + χ(G ⊗ H n),

2.2 Stability and semistability

5

and therefore

pH,E (n) =

χ(E ⊗ H n)

rank E

=

χ(F ⊗ H n) + χ(G ⊗ H n)

rank F + rank G

=

pH,F (n)rk F + pH,G(n)rk G

rank F + rank G

< pH,E(n).

This contradiction shows that the non-zero endomorphism a must be an isomorphism. Next,
let λ be an eigenvalue of the induced isomorphism ¯a : H0(E ⊗ H n) → H0(E ⊗ H n), for some
n ≫ 0, and let b := a − λId ∈ Hom(E, E). Since the induced map ¯b : H0(E ⊗ H n) →
H0(E ⊗ H n) is not an isomorphism, b itself cannot be an isomorphism. This means that b
must be zero. Thus a = λId and E must be simple, proving 1.

By Riemann-Roch, we have

χ(E ⊗ H n) = ZX

ch(E) exp(nH)TdX = rank E

H 2
2!

n2 + c1(E).Hn + const.

Therefore

pH,E(n) =

χ(E ⊗ H n)

rank E

=

H 2
2!

n2 +

c1(E).H
rank E

n + const =

H 2
2!

n2 + µ(E)n + const.

Statement 2 now follows by elementary algebra. For instance, suppose E is µ-stable. Then
µ(F ) < µ(E) for all coherent subsheaves F ⊂ E with 0 < rank F < rank E. This implies
that

pH,F (n) =

H 2
2!

n2 + µ(F )n + const <

n2 + µ(E)n + const = pH,E (n)

H 2
2!

for n ≫ 0, and thus E is stable.

Statement 3 also follows by elementary algebra. Suppose E is µ-semistable. Then µ(F ) ≤
µ(E) for all coherent subsheaves F ⊂ E with 0 < rank F < rank E. If E is not µ-stable then
we must have equality for some F , i.e.,

µ(F ) =

c1(F ).H
rank F

=

c1(E).H
rank E

= µ(E).

Because H is v-general, this can only happen if c1(F )/rank F = c1(E)/rank E, or equiv-
alently, c1(F )rank E = c1(E)rank F . Thus rank E divides c1(E)rank F , where rank F <
rank E, contradicting the fact that rank E and the divisibility of c1(E) are coprime.

Finally, statement 4 is proved in a similar manner. If E is semistable but not stable, then
there exists a proper subsheaf F ⊂ E such that pH,F (n) = pH,E(n) for n ≫ 0. Because H
is v-general, we must have v(F )rank E = v(E)rank F . If rank F < rank E then some prime
factor of rank E divides v(E), contradicting the primitivity of v(E). On the other hand, if
rank F = rank E then the quotient sheaf E/F is torsion. Moreover

χ(F ⊗ H n) = pH,F (n)rank F = pH,E (n)rank E = χ(E ⊗ H n),

so χ((E/F ) ⊗ H n) = 0 for n ≫ 0. This implies that E/F = 0, contradicting the fact that F
is a proper subsheaf of E.
(cid:3)

Gieseker [14] constructed the moduli space MH (v) of stable sheaves E on X with Mukai
vector v(E) = v, as a quasi-projective scheme.
If MH (v) is not already compact, then
one can compactify by adding semistable sheaves. Now a semistable sheaf E admits a
Jordan-H¨older ﬁltration, 0 = E0 ⊂ E1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Ek = E, whose graded factors Ei+1/Ei are
stable sheaves with the same normalized Hilbert polynomials as E. These graded factors

6

2 SIMPLE AND STABLE SHEAVES, AND THEIR MODULI SPACES

are uniquely determined by E, up to ordering, and two semistable sheaves are said to be S-
equivalent if they have the same graded factors. Then Gieseker also constructed the moduli
space MH (v)ss of S-equivalence classes of semistable sheaves E on X with Mukai vector
v(E) = v, as a projective scheme that compactiﬁes MH(v). (Note that a stable sheaf E is
also semistable, and its S-equivalence class consists of just the sheaf E itself.) In particular, if
every semistable sheaf is stable, then MH(v) will already be projective, and hence compact.
For example, by statement 4 of Lemma 2, this occurs when v is primitive and H is v-general.
Gieseker’s construction applies to arbitrary smooth projective surfaces (X, H), though
for K3 surfaces we can invoke Mukai’s results on the moduli space of simple sheaves. By
statement 1 of Lemma 2, the moduli space MH (v) of stable sheaves is an (open) subscheme of
Spl(v). Therefore for K3 surfaces, MH (v) is smooth and it inherits a closed non-degenerate
holomorphic two-form.

Notice that as the polarization H varies, we generally get diﬀerent open subschemes
MH (v) ⊂ Spl(v). For example, if H and H ′ lie on opposite sides of a wall of the ample cone,
then MH (v) and MH ′ (v) may be birational but not isomorphic. What is happening here
is that some locus Γ of MH (v) is removed and replaced by a locus Γ′ in MH ′ (v), and for
every point p ∈ Γ ⊂ Spl(v) there is a corresponding non-separated point p′ ∈ Γ′ ⊂ Spl(v)
(recall that Spl(v) is non-Hausdorﬀ!). We will say more about variations of the polarization
in Section 5.

Example Let v = (1, 0, 1 − n). A torsion free sheaf E with Mukai vector v(E) = (1, 0, 1 − n)
will have rank one, c1 = 0, and c2 = n. It will be µ-stable because there are no coherent
subsheaves F ⊂ E with 0 < rank F < rank E = 1. It will also be stable with respect to all
possible polarizations H because if F ⊂ E is a proper subsheaf then rank F = rank E = 1,
E/F is torsion, and thus

pH,E (n) − pH,F (n) = χ(E ⊗ H n) − χ(F ⊗ H n) = χ((E/F ) ⊗ H n) > 0

for n ≫ 0. Now E ∨∨ will be reﬂexive and therefore locally free, as X is a surface; thus
E ∨∨ ∼= OX . The cokernel of the inclusion E ֒→ E ∨∨ will be the structure sheaf OZ of a
zero-dimensional subscheme Z ⊂ X of length n. Thus E is identiﬁed with the ideal sheaf
IZ of Z,

0 −→ E ∼= IZ −→ E ∨∨ ∼= OX −→ OZ −→ 0,

and the moduli space MH (1, 0, 1 − n) is identiﬁed with the Hilbert scheme HilbnX of length
n zero-dimensional subschemes Z ⊂ X.

In low dimensions we can completely describe the moduli spaces.

Theorem 3 (Mukai [33], Corollary 3.6) If hv, vi = −2 then MH(v) is empty or a single
point.

Proof Simple sheaves with hv(E), v(E)i = −2 are known as rigid sheaves, because the space
Ext1(E, E) parametrizing their ﬁrst order deformations is trivial. Mukai ﬁrst shows that a
rigid torsion free sheaf E must be locally free. Moreover, if E is stable and F is another
semistable sheaf with v(F ) = v(E), then by Riemann-Roch

χ(E, F ) = −hv(E), v(F )i = 2.

So at least one of Hom(E, F ) and Hom(F , E) ∼= Ext2(E, F )∨ must be non-trivial. But
because E is stable, a homomorphism E → F , respectively F → E, must be an isomorphism.
(cid:3)

2.2 Stability and semistability

7

Theorem 4 (Mukai [33], Theorem 1.4, Corollary 4.6) Fix v ∈ Hev(X, Z) with hv, vi =
0 and ﬁx an ample divisor H on X. If every semistable sheaf E with v(E) = v is stable, then
MH (v) is empty or a K3 surface.

Remark As we have already observed, if v is primitive and H is v-general then the hy-
pothesis of the theorem is satisﬁed.

Proof Recall that the moduli space Spl(v) of simple sheaves with Mukai vector v is smooth
of dimension hv, vi + 2 = 2. As described above, MH (v) is an open subscheme of Spl(v).
Assume MH(v) is non-empty. If every semistable sheaf E with v(E) = v is stable, then MH(v)
contains a connected component M that is compact. We claim that every semistable sheaf
F with v(F ) = v is isomorphic to a stable sheaf in the family parametrized by M . To see
this, one takes a (quasi-)universal sheaf on X × M , uses it to construct a Fourier-Mukai
transform Φ : Db(X) → Db(M ), and then shows that Φ(F ) is the shift of a skyscraper sheaf
on M . Applying the inverse Fourier-Mukai transform then proves the claim (see the proof
of Proposition 4.4 [33] for details). It follows that MH(v) = M is irreducible. Moreover,
Spl(v), and therefore MH (v), admits a nowhere vanishing holomorphic two-form, so MH(v)
is an abelian or K3 surface. Finally, the cohomological Fourier-Mukai transform induces an
isometry

ϕQ : v⊥/Qv −→ H2(MH (v), Q),

where v⊥ denotes the orthogonal complement of Qv in Hev(X, Z). We conclude that MH(v)
is a K3 surface.
(cid:3)

Mukai also proved non-emptyness of these moduli spaces under certain conditions, a
result which was generalized by Yoshioka. Speciﬁcally, we say that a Mukai vector v ∈
Hev(X, Z) with v2 ∈ NS(X) is positive if v0 > 0, or if v0 = 0 and v2 is eﬀective, or if
v0 = v2 = 0 and v4 > 0. Then it follows from the general results in [49, 50] (and also
Corollary 3.5 of [52] for the rank zero case) that MH (v) is non-empty if v is primitive,
positive, and hv, vi ≥ −2.

In higher dimensions we have the following result, the culmination of the work of a
number of authors, including Mukai, G¨ottsche and Huybrechts, O’Grady, and Yoshioka.
First a deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition A holomorphic symplectic manifold is a compact K¨ahler manifold M that admits
a non-degenerate holomorphic two-form σ ∈ H0(M, Ω2
M ). Moreover, we say M is irreducible
if it is simply connected and H0(M, Ω2

M ) is generated by σ.

Remark Non-degeneracy means that taking the interior product with σ induces an isomor-
phism T M ∼= Ω1
M , where
2n is the dimension of M (which is necessarily even). In addition, σ is d-closed because
Hodge theory implies

M ; equivalently, σn is nowhere vanishing and trivializes KM = Ω2n

H0(M, Ω2

M ) ⊂ H2(M, C).

Theorem 5 Let v ∈ Hev(X, Z) be positive, primitive, and let H be v-general. Suppose that
2n := hv, vi + 2 is greater than 2. Then MH(v) is an irreducible holomorphic symplectic
manifold that is deformation equivalent to the Hilbert scheme HilbnX of n points on a K3
surface. In addition, the weight-two Hodge structure H2(MH (v), Z) is isomorphic to v⊥,
and this isomorphism takes the Beauville-Bogomolov quadratic form on H2(MH (v), Z) to
the restriction of the Mukai pairing on v⊥.

8

2 SIMPLE AND STABLE SHEAVES, AND THEIR MODULI SPACES

Remark Here v⊥ denotes the orthogonal complement of v in Hev(X, Z), which is given the
Hodge structure with (1, 1)-part equal to

H0(X, Z) ⊕ H1,1(X, Z) ⊕ H4(X, Z).

The Beauville-Bogomolov form [6] of an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold M is
a natural quadratic form on H2(M, Z), given by taking

˜q(α) =

n

2 ZM

(σ¯σ)n−1α2 + (1 − n)ZM

σn−1 ¯σnα ·ZM

σn ¯σn−1α

and rescaling by a rational constant (to make it primitive and integral).

Proof As describe above, Mukai [32, 34] proved that the moduli space Spl(v) of simple
sheaves is smooth of dimension hv, vi + 2 = 2n, and it admits a non-degenerate holomorphic
two-form. Moreover, MH(v) is an open subscheme, that is also compact under the hypothesis
that v is primitive and H is v-general. The relation between MH(v) and HilbnX was explored
ﬁrst in the rank two case, i.e., when v0 = 2, by G¨ottsche and Huybrechts [15], and then
for higher rank but with primitive v2 ∈ H2(X, Z) by O’Grady [36]. O’Grady’s idea is to
deform the underlying K3 surface X to a certain elliptic K3 surface, inducing a corresponding
deformation of MH (v). Then one can implement a backward induction, eventually reducing
the rank of the sheaves to one, i.e., at each step, one identiﬁes MH(v) with a moduli space
of stable sheaves whose rank is one less than for v (the identiﬁcation is a birational map,
but Huybrechts [21] later proved that birational holomorphic symplectic manifolds are also
deformation equivalent). Rank one torsion free sheaves on a K3 surface look like line bundles
tensored with ideal sheaves of zero-dimensional subschemes, and thus we can identify the
moduli space with HilbnX. Finally, Yoshioka removed the hypothesis that v2 be primitive
(Theorem 8.1 of [47]) and treated the rank zero case, i.e., pure dimension one sheaves [50].
Yoshioka’s approach diﬀers from O’Grady’s: he proves that stability is preserved under
Fourier-Mukai transforms, under certain conditions, and uses this to construct isomorphisms
between diﬀerent moduli spaces. He also proved a generalization of the theorem for non-
primitive v and studied non-general H in [49].

Mukai [34] constructed a canonical map

θv : v⊥ −→ H2(MH(v), Z)

using the Chern class of a quasi-universal sheaf on X × MH (v). By carefully tracking this
map under the birational identiﬁcations above, O’Grady [36] proved that it is an isomor-
phism of Hodge structures, and an isometry of lattices taking the Mukai pairing on v⊥ to
the Beauville-Bogomolov form on H2(MH (v), Z), provided that v2 is primitive (a technical
assumption that was later removed by Yoshioka [47]).
(cid:3)

2.3 Singular moduli spaces

Theorem 5 gives a complete description of MH (v) for primitive v and v-general H. For
both non-primitive v and non-general H, MH (v) will be non-compact, and one must add
(S-equivalence classes of) strictly semistable sheaves to compactify, MH (v) ⊂ MH(v)ss.
We will discuss variations of the polarization H in Section 5. For non-primitive v, the
strictly semistable locus is the singular locus of MH (v)ss; only in some special cases do
these singularities admit a symplectic desingularization.

2.4 The Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence

9

Theorem 6 (O’Grady [37]) For the Mukai vector v = (2, 0, −2) ∈ Hev(X, Z), the moduli
space MH(2, 0, −2)ss admits a symplectic desingularization. The resulting smooth irreducible
symplectic variety of dimension ten is not deformation equivalent to Hilb5X; indeed, it gives
a new deformation class of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds.

If W and Z ⊂ X are zero-dimensional subschemes of length two, then IW ⊕ IZ is a
strictly semistable sheaf with Mukai vector (2, 0, −2); in fact, all strictly semistable sheaves
in MH(2, 0, −2)ss are of this form, so the singular locus is isomorphic to

Sym2(Hilb2X).

O’Grady desingularizes MH (2, 0, −2)ss by a sequence of blowups, followed by a blowdown
to ensure that the induced holomorphic two-form on the resulting smooth space is non-
degenerate.

In general, suppose that v = mv0 ∈ Hev(X, Z) where m ≥ 2 and v0 is primitive. (Note
that we have changed our notation:
in this section v0 denotes a Mukai vector, not the
degree zero component of the Mukai vector v.) If hv0, v0i = −2 then every semistable sheaf
with Mukai vector mv0 will be isomorphic to E ⊕m, where E is the unique stable sheaf with
Mukai vector v0 (see Theorem 3); thus MH(v0)ss consists of a single point. If hv0, v0i = 0
then every semistable sheaf with Mukai vector mv0 will be S-equivalent to a direct sum of
m stable sheaves with Mukai vectors v0; thus MH(mv0)ss is isomorphic to SymmMH (v0),
where MH (v0) is a K3 surface by Theorem 4. Assume now that hv0, v0i ≥ 2.

Theorem 7 (Lehn and Sorger [25]) If hv0, v0i = 2 and H is v-general then the blowup
of the reduced singular locus of MH (2v0)ss is a symplectic desingularization. (In particular,
O’Grady’s example is of this form.)

Theorem 8 (Kaledin, Lehn, and Sorger [23]) If m ≥ 2 and hv0, v0i > 2 or m > 2
and hv0, v0i ≥ 2 then MH (mv0) has locally factorial singularities. Therefore, since the
singularities occur in codimension ≥ 4, they cannot be resolved symplectically.

Remark As stated, the theorem is for sheaves of non-zero rank, though Kaledin et al. also
proved it for rank zero under some additional hypotheses.

2.4 The Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence

We end this section with a discussion of one of the diﬀerential geometric aspects of stable
bundles. Let E be a holomorphic bundle equipped with a Hermitian metric h·, ·i. Recall
that there exists a unique unitary connection ∇ that is compatible with the holomorphic
structure on E, i.e.,

dhs1, s2i = h∇s1, s2i + hs1, ∇s2i

for all smooth sections s1 and s2 of E, and ∇0,1 = ¯∂E. Then ∇2 := ∇ ◦ ∇ will lie in
Ω1,1(EndE).

Deﬁnition Let ω be a K¨ahler form on X, and let E be a holomorphic bundle on X. Then
h·, ·i is a Hermitian-Einstein metric on E if its corresponding compatible unitary connection
∇ satisﬁes

∇2 ∧ ω = λIdEω2 ∈ Ω2,2(EndE)

where λ is a constant (equivalently, the contraction of ∇2 with ω equals λIdE).

+(M ) ⊕ Ω2

Example The space of two forms Ω2(M ) on a Riemannian four-manifold decomposes into a
direct sum Ω2
−(M ) of self-dual and anti-self-dual two forms. For a compact K¨ahler
surface (X, ω), the complexiﬁcation of Ω2
+(X) is spanned by (2, 0)-forms, (0, 2)-forms, and
−(X) is the orthogonal complement of ω in Ω1,1(X).
ω, whereas the complexiﬁcation of Ω2
Let E be a holomorphic bundle on X with c1(E) = 0, and equip E with a Hermitian metric
and corresponding compatible unitary connection ∇. If ∇ is Hermitian-Einstein then

∇2 ∧ ω = 0,

because E has slope µ(E) = 0. Thus ∇2 ∈ Ω1,1(EndE) and it is orthogonal to ω, implying
that ∇2 lies in Ω2
−(EndE). We call ∇ an anti-self-dual connection (an example of a Yang-
Mills instanton). Conversely, an anti-self-dual connection on a compact K¨ahler surface is
Hermitian-Einstein.

The main result we wish to describe is the Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence. It was
proved ﬁrst for Riemann surfaces by Narasimhan and Seshadri [35], then for projective
surfaces by Donaldson [11], and then for compact K¨ahler manifolds in arbitrary dimension
by Uhlenbeck and Yau [44] (and independently, for smooth projective varieties in arbitrary
dimension by Donaldson [12]).

Theorem 9 Let E be a holomorphic bundle E on a compact K¨ahler manifold (X, ω). Then
E admits a Hermitian-Einstein metric if and only if it is µ-polystable with respect to ω, i.e.,
it is a direct sum of µ-stable bundles.

As an application, we consider tensor products of bundles.

Proposition 10 If E and F are µ-stable bundles then E ⊗ F is µ-polystable.

Proof Equip E and F with Hermitian-Einstein metrics, with corresponding connections
∇E and ∇F . The induced Hermitian metric on E ⊗ F , with corresponding connection
∇E ⊗ IdF + IdE ⊗ ∇F , is easily seen to be Hermitian-Einstein too. Therefore E ⊗ F is
µ-polystable.

3 The Chow ring of a K3 surface

The Chow ring CH(X) of a K3 surface is the ring of algebraic cycles on X modulo ratio-
nal equivalence; the ring structure is given by intersection. The Chow ring is graded by
codimension,

CH(X) = CH 0(X) ⊕ CH 1(X) ⊕ CH 2(X),

though in this article we will adopt the common alternative notation

CH(X) = CH2(X) ⊕ CH1(X) ⊕ CH0(X).

Now CH2(X) = Z[X] for all irreducible surfaces, and CH1(X) ∼= Pic(X) is a lattice for
K3 surfaces. On the other hand, the group CH0(X) of 0-cycles up to rational equivalence
is inﬁnite-dimensional and much more complicated; simple and stable sheaves, and their
moduli, play a rˆole in understanding it.

Theorem 11 (Beauville-Voisin [8]) Let cX be the class of a point lying on a rational
curve in the K3 surface X. Then

1. cX is independent of the choice of point and rational curve,

2. if C1 and C2 are two curves in X, then the class of C1 ∩ C2 in CH0(X) is a multiple

of cX , and

3. the second Chern class c2(X) ∈ CH0(X) is equal to 24cX.

Deﬁnition The Beauville-Voisin ring is deﬁned to be

R(X) := CH2(X) ⊕ CH1(X) ⊕ ZcX = Z[X] ⊕ Pic(X) ⊕ ZcX .

Remark By statement 2 above, R(X) is a subring of CH(X). Moreover, the Mukai vector

v(L) = ch(L)Td

of a line bundle L on X, regarded as an element of the Chow ring, must lie in R(X).

Deﬁnition A spherical object on X is a bounded complex of sheaves, E • ∈ Db(X), such that

Extk(E •, E •) ∼= (cid:26) C if k = 0 or 2,

otherwise.

Line bundles are spherical objects, as are rigid sheaves. Spherical objects are the gener-

alization of rigid sheaves to objects of the derived category.

Theorem 12 (Huybrechts [22]) Let X be a projective K3 surface with Picard number
ρ(X) ≥ 2.

1. If E • ∈ Db(X) is a spherical object, then v(E •) ∈ R(X).

2. Derived equivalences preserve R(X), i.e., if Φ : Db(X) → Db(X ′) is an equivalence of
triangulated categories then ΦCH (R(X)) = R(X ′), where ΦCH : CH(X) → CH(X ′)
is the induced isomorphism of Chow groups.

12

3 THE CHOW RING OF A K3 SURFACE

Remark Statement 1 also holds when ρ(X) = 1. Huybrechts proved this under the
additional hypothesis that v(E •) = (r, kH, s), where H generates PicX and k ≡ ±1 (mod
r). Without this hypothesis, we can argue as follows: If r = 0 then

2 = χ(E •, E •) = −hv(E •), v(E •)i = −k2H 2 ≤ 0,

a contradiction; so without loss of generality we can assume r > 0. As explained in the proof
of Corollary 3.3 of [22], there exists a spherical locally free sheaf E such that v(E) = v(E •) in
cohomology. Corollary 2.6 of [22] shows that in fact v(E) = v(E •) in the Chow ring. Finally,
rigid sheaves are simple, so the theorem of Voisin stated below shows that c2(E) ∈ S0(X).
This means that v(E) ∈ R(X).

O’Grady [38] introduced a ﬁltration on CH0(X),

S0(X) := ZcX ⊂ S1(X) ⊂ S2(X) ⊂ . . . ⊂ Sg(X) ⊂ . . . ⊂ CH0(X),

by deﬁning Sg(X) to be the set of classes [Z] + acX , where Z = p1 + . . . + pg is an eﬀective
0-cycle of length g and a ∈ Z. Equivalently, Sg(X) is the set of elements of the form ι∗[Z],
where Z is a 0-cycle on a genus g curve C and ι : C → X is any non-constant morphism (not
necessarily an inclusion). Rigid sheaves belong to zero-dimensional moduli spaces; therefore
the following conjecture is a generalization of Theorem 12 of Huybrechts.

Conjecture 13 (O’Grady [38]) Suppose that MH (v) has dimension 2d. If E is a stable
sheaf in MH(v), or a semistable sheaf whose S-equivalence class [E] lies in MH (v)ss, then
c2(E) lies in Sd(X). Moreover, as we vary E in MH (v), and [E] in MH(v)ss, the set of
all second Chern classes c2(E) is precisely the set of elements of Sd(X) of the appropriate
degree, i.e.,

{c2(E) | [E] ∈ MH (v)ss} = {[Z] ∈ Sd(X) | deg Z = c2(v)}.

The conjecture is true in many cases.

Theorem 14 (O’Grady [38]) Suppose that MH(v) is non-empty and one of the following
holds:

1. v2 ∈ H2(X, Z) is primitive and equal to H, and v4 ≥ 0,

2. the Picard number ρ(X) ≥ 2, the rank v0 is coprime to the divisibility of v2 ∈ H2(X, Z),

and H is v-general,

3. the rank v0 ≤ 2 and H is v-general if v0 = 2.

Then the above conjecture is true for MH (v).

Theorem 15 (Voisin [45]) If E is a simple bundle with Mukai vector v(E) = v, then
c2(E) ∈ Sd(X), where 2d is the dimension of MH (v). Moreover,

{c2(E) | E ∈ Spl(v)} = {[Z] ∈ Sd(X) | deg Z = c2(v)}.

Remark Voisin’s result is for bundles that are simple, rather than stable or semistable.
But there are no restrictions on ρ(X) or v, so in the locally-free case, this generalizes both
Huybrechts’s and O’Grady’s results.

13

In addition, Voisin [45] characterized Sd(X) in terms of dimensions of rational equivalence

classes. Namely, for k > d ≥ 0,

Sd(X) ∩ {[Z] | deg Z = k}

is precisely the set of [Z] ∈ CH0(X) such that the subset of SymkX parametrizing eﬀective
cycles rationally equivalent to [Z] is non-empty and contains a component of dimension
≥ k − d.

In higher dimensions, a variation of O’Grady’s deﬁnition produces a ﬁltration on the
Chow ring CH0(X [n]) of the Hilbert scheme of points on the K3 surface X. Voisin [46]
again characterized this ﬁltration in terms of dimensions of rational equivalence classes. This
led to a picture, still partly conjectural, of the structure of the Chow ring of an arbitrary
hyperk¨ahler (i.e., holomorphic symplectic) variety.

4 Ample and nef cones of holomorphic symplectic man-

ifolds

Let X be a smooth projective variety, and denote by N1(X, Z) ⊂ H2(X, Z) the group of
curve classes modulo homological equivalence. The Mori cone of curves is the convex cone
NE1(X) ⊂ N1(X, R) = N1(X, Z) ⊗ R generated by eﬀective classes. The importance of
NE1(X), or rather its closure NE1(X), is that it determines the ample and nef cones of X,
as follows.

Theorem 16 (Kleiman’s criterion) A divisor D in X is ample (respectively, nef ) if and
only if D.C > 0 (respectively, ≥ 0) for all curves C ∈ NE1(X).

An extremal ray R of NE1(X) is generated by the class of a rational curve C ⊂ X, and
it yields a morphism ϕR : X → Z that contracts all rational curves equivalent to C. In this
way, the cone of curves describes the birational geometry of X.

Example Let X be a projective K3 surface with polarization H. Then the cone of curves
is given by

NE1(X) = hC ∈ N1(X, Z) | C2 ≥ −2, C.H > 0i,

where h
i denotes the cone spanned by the given curve classes. In this case, NE1(X) is
already closed, so a divisor D in X is ample if D.C > 0 for all curves C ⊂ X with C2 ≥ −2
and C.H > 0. An extremal ray R of the cone of curves will be generated by a (−2)-curve,
and the morphism ϕR : X → Z will contract this curve, thereby producing a rational double
point singularity in Z.

For higher-dimensional holomorphic symplectic manifolds, Hassett and Tschinkel intro-
duced the following conjectural description of the cone of curves. Recall that we have the
Beauville-Bogomolov integral quadratic form q( , ) on H2(X, Z) ∼= H2n−2(X, Z). We will
denote the dual form on

H2n−2(X, Z)∗ ∼= H2(X, Z)

also by q( , ); note that it is Q-valued since the Beauville-Bogomolov form is not necessarily
unimodular.

14

4 AMPLE AND NEF CONES OF HOLOMORPHIC SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS

Thesis 17 (Hassett-Tschinkel [19]) Let X be an irreducible holomorphic symplectic man-
ifold of dimension 2n with polarization H.

1. There exists a positive rational number cX , depending only on the deformation class

of X, such that

NE1(X) = hC ∈ N1(X, Z) | q(C) ≥ −cX, C.H > 0i.

2. The extremal case q(C) = −cX arises as follows: if ℓ is a line in a Lagrangian Pn ⊂ X

then q(ℓ) = −cX .

Remark When X is a deformation of the Hilbert scheme of n points on a K3 surface
(in particular, when X is a moduli space MH(v) of stable sheaves on a K3 surface with v
positive, primitive, and H v-general), Hassett and Tschinkel [19] gave a conjectural value of
cX = n+3
2 . They also gave proposals for the birational maps resulting from various values
of q(R) < 0. They proved that an extremal ray R corresponding to a divisorial contraction
satisﬁes −2 ≤ q(R) < 0 (this is Theorem 2.1 in [19]).

Example Let X be the Hilbert scheme HilbnS of n points on a K3 surface S. The
exceptional divisor E, i.e., the locus of non-reduced subschemes, is 2-divisible in H2(X, Z);
write E = 2δ. Then

H2(X, Z) ∼= H2(S, Z) ⊕ Zδ

is an isomorphism of lattices that takes the Beauville-Bogomolov form q on the left hand
side to the direct sum of the intersection pairing on H2(S, Z) and (δ, δ) = −2(n − 1) on the
right hand side. Let C be a generic ﬁbre of E over the ‘big’ diagonal in SymnS. Then C is
a rational curve and E|C is isomorphic to O(−2). This implies that

C = −δ∨ ∈ NE1(X) ⊂ H2(X, R) ∼= H2(X, R)∗.

Note that

q(C) = q(δ∨) =

1

q(δ)

=

−1

2(n − 1)

.

The corresponding contraction is of course the Hilbert-Chow morphism HilbnS → SymnS.

Example Now suppose that the K3 surface S contains a rational (−2)-curve C. Then
SymnC gives a Lagrangian Pn in X = HilbnS. A line ℓ in this Pn is given by ﬁxing n − 1
points in C and allowing the nth point to vary. To identify the class of ℓ in H2(X, R) ∼=
H2(X, R)∗ we intersect it with various divisors. Firstly

ℓ.δ =

1
2

ℓ.E = n − 1,

as each intersection of ℓ with E has multiplicity 2. Secondly, let D be the divisor of sub-
schemes whose support intersects C. Because ℓ is equivalent to a rational curve in X given
by one point on C and n − 1 ﬁxed points not on C,

Since q(D) = −2, we conclude that

ℓ.D = C2 = −2.

ℓ = D + (n − 1)δ∨.

15

Finally, we can calculate

q(ℓ) = q(D) + (n − 1)2q(δ∨) = −2 + (n − 1)2(cid:18) −1

2(n − 1)(cid:19) = −

n + 3

2

.

The corresponding contraction collapses the Lagrangian Pn ⊂ X to a point.

Remark The last example veriﬁes the second part of Hassett and Tschinkel’s conjecture in
this case, but it does not prove it outright because a priori there could exist other Lagrangian
Pns in diﬀerent monodromy group orbits of X. Nonetheless, the fact that q(ℓ) = − n+3
for a
2
line ℓ in any Lagrangian Pn in a deformation X of HilbnS was proved for n = 2 by Hassett
and Tschinkel [18], for n = 3 by Harvey, Hassett, and Tschinkel [17], and for n = 4 by
Bakker and Jorza [2].

Returning to the ﬁrst part of Hassett and Tschinkel’s conjecture, they proved the fol-

lowing.

Theorem 18 (Hassett-Tschinkel [18]) Let X be a deformation of the Hilbert scheme of
two points on a K3 surface. Then a divisor D in X is ample if D.C > 0 for all curves C in

hC ∈ N1(X, Z) | q(C) ≥ −5/2, C.H > 0i.

In fact, it is enough to consider curves C with C.H > 0 and q(C) = −5/2, −2, −1/2, or
≥ 0.

Thus Hassett and Tschinkel established suﬃcient conditions for D to be ample in this
case; they did not prove that these conditions are necessary. In fact, in general they are
not: Proposition 10.3 and Remark 10.4 of Bayer and Macr`ı [4] (and also independent work
of Markman) shows that the cone of curves could be smaller than predicted, though the
ﬁrst instance of this happening is in dimension ten. Theorem 12.2 of Bayer and Macr`ı [5]
gives the correct description of the Mori cone of curves when X is a moduli space of sheaves
on a K3 surface, and this was extended to the case when X is an arbitrary deformation of
HilbnS by Bayer, Hassett, and Tschinkel [3]. The precise statement is somewhat lengthy;
in any case, we will say more about Bayer and Macr`ı’s methods in the next section. These
methods also led to a veriﬁcation of the bounds on the curves generating extremal rays.

Theorem 19 (Bayer, Hassett, and Tschinkel [3], Mongardi [30]) Let X be a defor-
mation of HilbnS, and let R be an extremal ray of NE1(X). Then R contains an eﬀective
curve C with q(C) ≥ − n+3
2 .

Remark Bayer et al. proved this result in the projective case, whereas Mongardi’s argu-
ment, obtained independently, works also in the non-projective case.

5 Moduli of stable complexes

16

5 MODULI OF STABLE COMPLEXES

of triangulated categories [31]. They have become an indispensible tool in studying moduli
spaces because they induce birational maps of the form

M(X,H)(v) 99K M(X ′,H ′)(v′)

E

7→ Φ(E)•.

Here Φ(E)• is an element of the derived category Db(X ′), i.e., a priori it is a complex of
sheaves, but in nice situations it will be a sheaf (or shifted sheaf), and even a stable sheaf
with respect to some polarization H ′ of X ′. If Φ(E)• is a stable sheaf for all E in M(X,H)(v)
then the above map will be an isomorpism. More generally, one would like to deal with
moduli spaces of complexes of sheaves, and this is one of the motivations behind extending
the notion of stability to complexes. Henceforth, we will drop the • and write a complex of
sheaves E • simply as E.

Deﬁnition[Bridgeland [9]] A stability condition (Z, P) on Db(X) consists of a homomor-
phism Z : K(X) → C from the Grothendieck K-group of X and full additive subcategories
P(φ) ⊂ Db(X) for each φ ∈ R, that satisfy:

1. Z(E) ∈ C is a positive multiple of exp(iπφ) for all E ∈ P(φ),

2. P(φ + 1) = P(φ)[1] for all φ ∈ R,

3. if φ1 > φ2 then HomDb(X)(E1, E2) = 0 for all Ei ∈ P(φi),

4. every E ∈ Db(X) admits a generalized Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltration

Remark The homomorphism Z is known as the central charge; its argument πφ can be
regarded as a generalization of the slope µ of a sheaf, or rather, of tan−1 µ ∈ S1 (see
the example below). The collection of subcategories P is known as a slicing of Db(X).
The Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltration of a sheaf has graded pieces of descending slope; the
generalized Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltration extends this to complexes of sheaves.

Theorem 20 (Bridgeland [9]) The space of stability conditions Stab(X) on Db(X) is a
topological space that is locally homeomorphic to a complex vector space.

More precisely, for each connected component Σ of Stab(X) there is a linear subspace
V (Σ) of HomZ(K(X), C), and the local homeomorphism Σ → V (Σ) is given by the forgetful
map (Z, P) 7→ Z, which takes a stability condition to its central charge.

Example Suppose that X is a K3 surface with polarization H. Naively one would like to
deﬁne a stability condition with central charge Z(E) = rank E + ic1(E).H, whose argument
φ satisﬁes

tan πφ =

c1(E).H
rank E

= µH (E).

However, this homomorphism Z : K(X) → C vanishes on sheaves with zero-dimensional
support, whereas the central charge of a stability condition must be non-zero on all non-
zero sheaves. Instead, Bridgeland [10] found the following construction. Let β + iω be a
complexiﬁed K¨ahler class on X, i.e., β and ω lie in NS(X) ⊗ R with ω in the ample cone.
Deﬁne

Z(E) := hexp(β + iω), v(E)i =

2r (cid:0)(c2

1 − 2rs) + r2ω2 − (c1 − rβ)2(cid:1) + i(c1 − rβ).ω,

where E has Mukai vector v(E) = (r, c1, s). For generic β and ω (more precisely, one requires
Z(E) 6∈ R≤0 for all spherical sheaves E on X), Bridgeland described how to construct a
stability condition with central charge Z. These stability conditions belong to a distinguished
component Stab†(X) ⊂ Stab(X) of the space of all stability conditions on Db(X).

Now deﬁne N (X) := Z ⊕ NS(X) ⊕ Z, with inclusion N (X) ⊗ C ⊂ HomZ(K(X), C)
given by the Mukai pairing. There is an open subset P(X) ⊂ N (X) ⊗ C given by vectors
whose real and imaginary parts span positive deﬁnite two-planes in N (X) ⊗ R. Denote by
P +(X) ⊂ P(X) the component containing exp(β + iω), and let P +
0 (X) ⊂ P +(X) be the
complement of the union of all δ⊥, i.e., complex hyperplanes orthogonal to δ, where δ ranges
over all spherical classes in N (X) with hδ, δi = −2. Bridgeland proved that the forgetful
map

π : Stab†(X) −→ N (X) ⊗ C ⊂ HomZ(K(X), C)

(Z, P)

7−→ exp(β + iω),

is a covering map over P +
0 (X). The group of deck transformations is given by the subgroup
of the group of autoequivalences of Db(X) that act trivially on cohomology and that preserve
the component Stab†(X) ⊂ Stab(X).

Remark Although there is no Bridgeland stability condition on Db(X) with central charge
Z(E) = rank E + ic1(E).H, one can recover H-stability by letting σ ∈ Stab†(X) go to a ‘large
volume limit’.

For moduli spaces of sheaves, stability depends on the choice of polarization H in the
ample cone, which has a wall and chamber structure (dependent on v). As we vary H inside
a chamber, the moduli space does not change. But when H hits a wall, some stable sheaves
can become strictly semistable; and when H passes into a new chamber, they can become
unstable. Thus we may ﬁnd that MH+ (v) and MH−(v) are birational for H+ and H− in
adjacent chambers of the ample cone, and an analysis of which sheaves become strictly
semistable for H on the wall will allow us to describe the birational transformation in more
detail.

Similarly, the space of stability conditions Stab(X) admits a wall and chamber struc-
ture (dependent on v). In some situations, the above wall-crossing procedure allows us to
construct moduli spaces Mσ(v) of stable complexes on X, by

1. starting with a stability condition σ for which all stable complexes E with Mukai
vector v(E) = v are actually sheaves (and thus Mσ(v) is simply a moduli space of
stable sheaves on X),

2. and then varying the stability condition σ and keeping track of the birational modiﬁ-

cations that occur as we cross walls.

18

5 MODULI OF STABLE COMPLEXES

As we cross a wall, the locus of sheaves that become unstable will be replaced by a new
locus of sheaves, or complexes of sheaves, that are stable for the new stability condition.
Obviously it is important to understand the shapes and positions of walls in Stab(X), and
this has been studied by several authors; for example, Maciocia [26] proved some results for
general projective surfaces.

Example Arcara and Bertram [1] considered the case v = (0, H, H 2/2) with Bridgeland
stability conditions σt given by β + iω = 1
2 H + itH where t ∈ R>0. For suﬃciently large
t (in fact, for t > 1
2 ) all σt-stable complexes E with Mukai vector v(E) = v are actually
sheaves. These sheaves look like ι∗L, where L is a rank-one torsion free sheaf on C ∈ |H|,
and ι : C ֒→ X is the inclusion; thus for t > 1
2 , Mσt (v) is just the compactiﬁed relative
Jacobian of the family of curves in the linear system |H|. As t is decreased, we run into
walls at certain values td. Arcara and Bertram described the Mukai ﬂops

Mσt

d +ǫ(v) 99K Mσt

d−ǫ (v)

that occur when we cross these walls. The universal object (complex of sheaves) on X ×
d +ǫ (v) by an elementary modi-
Mσt
ﬁcation.

d−ǫ (v) is obtained from the universal object on X × Mσt

In the above example, even after varying t and performing Mukai ﬂops, a generic point of
Mσt (v) will still represent a sheaf on X, which is a rather special case. Indeed, this procedure
does not yield a method of constructing moduli spaces Mσ(v) of stable complexes for general
v. A priori, these most general moduli spaces exist as Artin stacks of ﬁnite type over C, as
proved by Toda [43]. But stronger results are possible by applying Fourier-Mukai transforms,
as observed by Minamide, Yanagide, and Yoshioka [29] in the Picard rank ρ(X) = 1 case
and further developed in Section 7 of Bayer and Macr`ı [4] for ρ(X) > 1. Speciﬁcally, they
show that for a generic stability condition σ ∈ Stab†(X) there is a Fourier-Mukai transform
Φ : Db(X) → Db(X ′) from X to another K3 surface X ′ that takes σ-stable complexes on X
with Mukai vectors v to Φ(σ)-semistable sheaves on X ′. Here Φ(σ) is the stability condition
on Db(X ′) coming from σ and the homeomorphism Stab†(X) → Stab†(X ′) induced by Φ.
Thus Mσ(X) can be identiﬁed with a moduli space of semistable sheaves on X ′. (More
precisely, there may be a non-trivial gerbe α ∈ Br(X ′), and the sheaves on X ′ will be
α-twisted.)

An important step in studying the birational geometry of these moduli spaces is the
description of ample and nef line bundles. Bayer and Macr`ı gave a natural construction of a
‘polarization’ on any family of semistable complexes of sheaves admitting a universal object.

Theorem 21 (Bayer and Macr`ı [4]) Let σ = (Z, P) be a Bridgeland stability condition
on X. Let S be a family of σ-semistable objects in Db(X) with Mukai vector v, and with a
universal family E ∈ Db(S × X). Then there exists a natural divisor class ℓσ on S that is
nef, and moreover ℓσ.C = 0 for a curve C ⊂ S if and only if Et is S-equivalent to Et′ for all
t and t′ in C.

Proof We just give the deﬁnition of the divisor class ℓσ and refer to [4] for the proof
of its properties. A divisor class is uniquely determined by its values on curves. Given a
(projective, reduced, and irreducible) curve C ⊂ S, we can take its structure sheaf OC and
apply the integral transform Φ : Db(S) → Db(X) coming from E to get Φ(OC ) ∈ Db(X).
Then we deﬁne

ℓσ.C := Im(cid:18) Z(Φ(OC ))

Z(v) (cid:19) .

19

Of course this deﬁnition depends implicitly on the universal family E ∈ Db(S × X), but one
can show that changing E by the pullback of a line bundle on S does not change ℓσ.C, and
so we supress E from the notation.
(cid:3)

If the stability condition σ lies in the interior of a chamber C of Stab(X) then every
σ-semistable complex is actually σ-stable. This implies that if Mσ(v) is the moduli space
of σ-stable complexes on X with Mukai vector v, then ℓσ will be ample on Mσ(v) (in the
Picard rank ρ(X) = 1 case, the ampleness of ℓσ also appears as Corollary 5.17 of Minamide
et al. [29]). The assignment σ 7→ ℓσ then gives a map from C to the ample cone Amp(Mσ(v)),
and from the closure C to the nef cone Nef(Mσ(v)).

Bayer and Macr`ı [4] then studied the following situation. Suppose that σ0 is a generic
stability condition on the boundary of the closure C, i.e., on a wall of Stab(X), and suppose
that the locus of strictly σ0-semistable complexes in Mσ(v) is codimension at least two.
Then ℓσ0 is big and nef and induces a birational contraction Mσ(v) → Y . If σ0 lies on a wall
separating two chambers C+ and C− then we obtain two birational contractions as above.
In fact, the resulting spaces Y+ and Y− are isomorphic and we obtain a ﬂop

Mσ+ (v)

Mσ−(v)

Y+ = Y−

,

where σ+ ∈ C+ and σ− ∈ C− are stability conditions near σ0 but on opposite sides of the
wall. Thus Mσ−(v) is a diﬀerent birational model of Mσ+ (v). Moreover, the maps

C+ −→ Nef(Mσ+ (v))

and

C− −→ Nef(Mσ− (v))

can be ‘glued’ along the wall, and after extending this process to all chambers, we arrive at
a map from the space Stab†(X) of stability conditions to the cone of movable divisors on
Mσ+ (v).

The main diﬃculty with this argument is that there also exist totally semistable walls
that arise from spherical objects in Db(X). On these walls, every complex in Mσ0 (v) will
be strictly semistable, and the corresponding birational transformation could be a ﬂop, a
divisorial contraction, or even an isomorphism. The diﬀerent possibilities are classiﬁed in
Theorem 5.7 of Bayer and Macr`ı [5].

These ideas have numerous applications to the geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves on
K3 surfaces. For example, they can be used to determine the nef cone of certain Hilbert
schemes of points on K3 surfaces.

Theorem 22 (Bayer and Macr`ı [4], Proposition 10.3) Let X be a K3 surface with po-
larization H of degree H 2 = 2d, and assume that the N´eron-Severi group is generated over
Z by H. For n ≥ d+3
d+n δ. (Here 2δ
denotes the locus of non-reduced subschemes, and we regard H as a divisor on HilbnX via
the isomorphism

2 , the nef cone of HilbnX is generated by H and H − 2d

H2(HilbnX, Z) ∼= H2(X, Z) ⊕ Zδ,

as in Section 4.)

Remark This result is also a special case of Proposition 4.39 of Yoshioka [47], applied to
the moduli space MH(1, 0, 1 − n) ∼= HilbnX. Of course this earlier proposition is proved
without reference to moduli spaces of stable complexes.

5 MODULI OF STABLE COMPLEXES

Remark Bayer and Macr`ı also identify an extremal ray R, as a curve of S-equivalent σ0-
semistable complexes, that is contracted by the morphism corresponding to H − 2d
d+n δ. This
ray satisﬁes

q(R) = −

revealing that the Mori cone can be smaller than predicted by Hassett and Tschinkel [19].

Another application is to the existence of Lagrangian ﬁbrations on Hilbert schemes of
points on K3 surfaces, i.e., ﬁbrations over Pn whose ﬁbres are Lagrangian with respect to the
holomorphic symplectic form. The Hyperk¨ahler SYZ Conjecture asserts that an irreducible
holomorphic symplectic manifold admits a (rational) Lagrangian ﬁbration if and only if it
contains an isotropic divisor, i.e., a divisor D such that q(D) = 0 where q is the Beauville-
Bogomolov form (see Huybrechts [16] or the author’s article [39]). For a divisor

D = C + kδ ∈ H2(HilbnX, Z) ∼= H2(X, Z) ⊕ Zδ,

this means that q(D) = C2 − 2k2(n − 1) must vanish.
It was proved, independently by
Markushevich and the author, that this leads to a Lagrangian ﬁbration if H = C generates
the N´eron-Severi group of X.

Theorem 23 (Markushevich [27], Sawon [40]) Let X be a K3 surface with N´eron-Severi
group generated over Z by the polarization H. If H 2 = 2k2(n − 1) for some integer k, then
HilbnX admits a Lagrangian ﬁbration.

Proof We just give an outline of the argument. For w = (k, H, k(n − 1)) ∈ Hev(X, Z),
the moduli space MH (w) of stable sheaves on X is a K3 surface, which we denote by X ′,
and there exists a twisted Fourier-Mukai transform Φ : Db(X) → Db(X ′, β). The twist β
is necessary because MH(w) is not a ﬁne moduli space. For Z ∈ HilbnX, one can show
that the transform of the ideal sheaf IZ is a sheaf concentrated in a single degree.
In
fact, Φ(IZ )[1] is a torsion sheaf supported on a curve C ′ in X ′. Therefore Φ induces an
isomorphism of HilbnX with a so-called Beauville-Mukai integrable system [7] on X ′, i.e., the
relative compactiﬁed Jacobian of a complete linear system |C ′| of curves on X ′. The latter
is obviously a Lagrangian ﬁbration, with the map to |C ′| ∼= Pn given by taking supports. (cid:3)

Theorem 10.8 of Bayer and Macr`ı [4] extends the above theorem to the case where C =
2H is twice the generator of the N´eron-Severi group. Their argument is roughly as follows.
The hypothesis is that 4H 2 = 2k2(n − 1) for some odd integer k. One considers the moduli
spaces Mσt(v) of stable complexes where v = (1, 0, 1 − n) and σt is the family of Bridgeland
stability conditions on Db(X) given by β + iω = − 2
k H + itH, where t > 0. For t ≫ 0 we
have Mσt (v) = HilbnX. There is also a Fourier-Mukai transform Φ : Db(X) → Db(X ′, β),
as above, that induces an isomorphism of moduli spaces

Mσt (v) ∼= MΦ(σt)(Φ(v)).

For t close to 0, the right hand side is a moduli space of sheaves on X ′; indeed it is a
Beauville-Mukai system, and therefore a Lagrangian ﬁbration. Finally, one describes what
happens as t varies from very large to very small: there are ﬁnitely many wall-crossings,
and each wall-crossing induces a birational modiﬁcation of the moduli space. It follows that
HilbnX is birational to a Lagrangian ﬁbration; we say that it admits a rational Lagrangian

ﬁbration. Moreover, Bayer and Macr`ı proved that every minimal model for HilbnX arises
as a moduli space of stable complexes in Db(X) for some stability condition.

In their subsequent paper [5], Bayer and Macr`ı broadly generalized these results so as
to apply to any moduli space MH(v) of stable sheaves on a K3 surface, not just Hilbert
schemes of points. They showed that

1. every minimal model of MH(v) can be interpreted as a moduli space of σ-stable com-

plexes with Mukai vector v for some Bridgeland stability condition σ ∈ Stab†(X),

2. the chamber decomposition of the movable cone of MH (v) can be determined from the
wall and chamber structure of the special component Stab†(X) ⊂ Stab(X) described
above,

3. and the Hyperk¨ahler SYZ Conjecture holds for MH(v).

Since we have already given an indication of the ideas and methods involved, we refer the
reader to the original paper [5] for precise statements and more details.
