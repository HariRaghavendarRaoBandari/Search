ABSTRACT

Laser plasma interaction with micro-engineered targets at relativistic intensities has been greatly promoted by recent
progress in the high contrast lasers and the manufacture of advanced micro- and nano-structures. This opens
new possibilities for the physics of laser-matter interaction. Here we propose a novel approach that leverages the
advantages of high-pressure CO2 laser, laser-waveguide interaction, as well as micro-engineered plasma structure
to accelerate electrons to peak energy greater than 1 GeV with narrow slice energy spread (∼ 1%) and high overall
efﬁciency. The acceleration gradient is 26 GV/m for a 1.3 TW CO2 laser system. The micro-bunching of a long
electron beam leads to the generation of a chain of ultrashort electron bunches with the duration roughly equal
to half-laser-cycle. These results open a way for developing a compact and economic electron source for diverse
applications.

Introduction
Laser wakeﬁeld acceleration1 of particles to relativistic energies has been greatly promoted by the invention of chirped-pulse-
ampliﬁcation (CPA)2 more than twenty years ago. The ultrashort laser pulses with huge peak powers enabled by the CPA
technique allowed for quasimonoenergetic electron bunches to be generated in underdense plasmas in so-called bubble regime3–6
of laser wakeﬁeld. Pioneering experiments had reported that electrons with a few percent energy spread and sub-milliradian
divergences beyond 4.2 GeV can be produced,7 which demonstrates the impressive progress in plasma-based acceleration.
However, a signiﬁcant drawback is the traditional CPA lasers use TiSa crystals which deliver an average power of a few Watts
only at a low overall efﬁciency.8 On the other hand, well-known for its industrial applications, the overall efﬁciency (5-20%
from wall plug) of CO2 laser is among the highest of all lasers. Hence, it is the most economic choice when considering high
energy physics applications, where high luminosities are usually required.

Nowadays, high-pressure CO2 laser has already reached multi-Terawatt-level9 and been successfully applied for a series of
proton acceleration experiments.10, 11 However, it has been less progresses in CO2 laser-driven wakeﬁeld acceleration,12, 13
mainly because of the difﬁculty with building ultra-short CO2 laser system. In general, it is well known that the longitudinal
dimension of the driver of plasma wakeﬁeld should be comparable to plasma wavelength in order to resonantly excite a
bubble,3, 14, 15 such that for the typical CO2 laser pulse duration (τ ∼ 10 ps), an extremely low-density plasma (ne ∼ 1013 cm−3)
is required, which is of little interest to the accelerator community since the maximum acceleration gradient (i.e. wave breaking
ﬁeld) is on the same order of magnitude with the conventional RF accelerators.

In parallel, direct laser acceleration (DLA) offers an attractive alternative,16, 17 where no threshold intensity18 and no
limitiations on the pulse duration. Normally, a waveguide can be used to guide laser pulses over distances much larger than the
Rayleigh length ZR = πw2
0/λ0 (w0 is the spot size and λ0 is the laser wavelength), while simultaneously, transverse magnetic
(TM) optical modes are excited in the channel. The co-propagating electrons in a proper phase can be accelerated with a peak
longitudinal electric ﬁeld that can be estimated by19–21

E[GV /cm] ≈ 8a0

where a0 = eE0/mecω0 is the normalized laser amplitude, c is the light velocity in vacuum me is the mass of an electron, e is
the unit charge, ω0 is the frequency of laser, and R is the radius of waveguide in µm. For a 1.3 TW CO2 laser pulse with a0 = 5

and channel radius R = 6λ0 ≈ 64 µm, the peak acceleration gradient is roughly 0.64 GV/cm, which compare favorably to laser
wakeﬁeld acceleration with ultra-short laser pulses at the same power level.

However, the slippage between laser phase velocity and the electron velocity (essentially c) forbids the electrons to stay
in the acceleration phase, which sets a limit on the maximum energy that can be aquired. Historically, periodical grating
surfaces22, 23 and neutral gas ﬁlling24 have been proposed to solve the dephasing problem, but none of them can survive the
relativistic intensities required for high acceleration gradient even for the pulse duration. In fully ionized plasma channel,
the phase velocity of laser is superluminal. A corrugated plasma waveguide has been proposed as ultrahigh intensity optical
slow-wave structure, where net energy gain can be achieved using a radially polarized laser propagating in a density-modulated
gas jet.18 More recently, owing to the advancements in laser pulse cleaning techniques25, 26 and 3D direct laser writing
(DLW) of materials,27 laser interaction with ﬁne plasma structure is drawing more and more attention. The micro- and
nano-structured plasma targets have been introduced to manipulate laser matter interactions21, 28–30 Simulations suggest that the
longitudinal electric ﬁeld in excess of 1 TV/m can be achieved in an overdense micro-plasma-waveguide.21 An taylored plasma
microstructure that can overcome the phase slippage would allow for enormous acceleration gradients.
In this letter, we propose a novel electron acceleration scheme using DLA in a curved plasma channel (CPW) that is capable
of generating energetic (> 1 GeV) ultra-short (duration ∼ half-laser-cycle) electron bunch chain with slice energy spread ∼ 1%.
These high-quality electron beams can be widely applied in high energy physics, study of atomic and molecular dynamics

Shows the longitudinal electric ﬁeld and electron motion at different propagating distances (marked by the red cube-frame in

on the back and left walls in (b-d) presents the Ex ﬁeld and electron position (black dots) at longitudinal slice z = 0 and
transverse cross-section x = 6.5λ0, respectively. The waveguide is properly designed with a curvature in the polarization
direction, detail dimension of half of the CPW period is shown in (e) for x-y plain (the waveguide is uniform along z-direction,
and the size in z dimension is 12λ0 in the presented 3D PIC simulation). The l1 is the half-CPW curvature period, and the ratio
of l1 and l2 is optimized according to the simulation (l2 = 0.442l1). If l1 matches the dephasing length, the electron bunch can
continuously gain energy until it overtakes the entire laser pulse.

and generating coherent x-rays. In the presented study, A CPW is used to overcome the phase slippage as shown in Fig. 1.
Inspired by the fact that the longitudinal electric ﬁeld in the CPW is anti-symmetric with respect to the propagation axis in the
polarization direction (as shown in Fig. 1(b-d)), we properly design the spatial period of CPW to match the dephasing length
of electrons. So that the relative displacement between electrons and laser ﬁeld in the longitudinal and transverse directions
keeps the electrons in the accelerating phase (for most of the time), enabling continuous energy gain of witness beam until it
overtakes the entire laser pulse. In addition, a linearly polarized CO2 laser beam is employed as the driver, not only due to the
high overall efﬁciency discussed above, but also because a long infrared wavelength enables a large acceleration bracket, which
increases the number of particles per bunch. Nevertheless, the wavelength of drive laser is not mandatory, it should be carefully
chosen according to the applications.

Results
PIC simulation results
Here we ﬁrst demonstrate the acceleration process with three dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations using the
code VLPL,31 the parameters can be found in Methods.The CPW is constituted with an overdense slab and an arc, the detailed
dimensions for the structure are shown in Fig. 1(e). The initial energy of the injected electron bunch is 100 MeV. Figures 1(b-d)
show the relative motion of the electron bunch and longitudinal electric ﬁeld in half of the CPW period, which indicate the
transverse motion of the guided laser beam perfectly compensates the phase slippage effect. As soon as the longitudinal phase
slippage reaches half of laser cycle, electrons exactly fall into the acceleration phase on the opposite side of channel as expected.
Moreover, since only the electrons with proper phase (Ex < 0) can be captured and accelerated within a long electron bunch, a
chain of ultrashort electron bunches is generated. The duration of a single electron bunch is governed by the laser wavelength,
an attosecond electron train can be generated if a short-wavelength laser is employed as the driver, which may be applied in the
ultrafast electron diffraction and 4D microscopy.32–34
In order to obtain a deeper insight in the laser pulse propagation and electron acceleration, we perform 2D PIC simulation
on the electron acceleration over 10 centimeters (10 CPW periods). A long laser pulse (duration ∼ 1 ps) is employed to enable
the acceleration over a long distance. The on-axis longitudinal electric ﬁeld and witness electron density proﬁle are plotted in
Fig. 2(a) for one CPW period. One can see that the micro-bunching occurs simultaneously with the acceleration during the ﬁrst
2-mm propagation in the CPW. The generated micro bunches stay in the acceleration phase for most of time.

Figure 2(b) presents the peak energy of electron bunch at the end of each CPW period, where the ﬁnal electron energy
attained is 1.5 GeV. The acceleration gradient decreases as the laser energy depletes in the CPW. After 10 cm propagation, the
laser loses 80% of its energy. For electrons with divergence smaller than 1 mrad, the overall laser-to-electron energy efﬁciency

is roughly 11%. The inset of Fig. 2(b) shows the peak electron energy evolution in the ﬁrst CPW period. The slight energy
decrease observed at L ≈ 3 mm and 8 mm is due to the brief passage of the witness bunch through the decelerating phase as the
laser pulse is guided across the beam axis (see Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 2(a)). The net energy gain in the ﬁrst CPW period (1 cm) is
260 MeV that results in an average acceleration gradient of 26 GV/m, or roughly 40% of the peak electric ﬁeld predicted in
Eq. (1).

Theoretical analysis
In the following, we try to give an estimation on the electromagnetic ﬁeld and acquire basic results for dephasing distance by
investigating laser propagation in a plane plasma waveguide. Further PIC simulation should be relied on to obtain optimum
parameters for a real CPW. Considering a y-polarized laser pulse entering the plasma waveguide along x-axis, the waveguide
has a rectangular cross-section in y-z plane (y = −y0 ∼ y0, and z = −z0 ∼ z0). Following the methods in Ref.,20, 21 one can
easily write the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in terms of two Hertz potentials Πe and Πh in Cartesian coordinate system:

different colors in (b) corresponding to the phase space at corresponding distance, and the inset of (c) presents the phase space

Discussion
Apparently, the acceleration gradient is only uniform along the z−direction, the nonuniformity in x- and y-direction tends to
broaden energy spread of witness beam during the acceleration. However, the quality of acceleration can be understood when
a short witness electron bunch is injected into the CPW. The witness bunch stays monoenergetic as long as it is injected to
the position corresponding to the peak acceleration ﬁeld. The sufﬁciently short bunch length (∼1 µm, occupies about 10%
of the laser cycle) makes sure it gains little longitudinal energy chirp as shown in Fig. 3(a). Also, the transverse phase space
map (Fig. 3(b)) illustrates that although the accelerating ﬁeld varies along the y-axis, the integration in one period of CPW is
uniform. So the electrons at different transverse position gains the same amount of energy in one CPW period. As a result,
when a short (1 µm) electron bunch is injected into the proper accelerating phase, a quasi-monoenergetic electron beam can be
obtained as shown in Fig. 3(c). The relative r.m.s energy spread at highest energy (1.5 GeV) is about 2% for the whole beam,
this result can be further optimized by employing shorter witness bunch. The absolute energy spread (cid:52)ε increases slightly
owing to longitudinal energy chirp as shown by the inset phase space map, and the r.m.s slice energy spread is 0.83%.

The above results also allow us to derive the matching condition which is crucial to the proposed scheme. In a sufﬁciently
short propagation distance dx, the change in transverse size of CPW is negligible, the CPW can be treated as a plane waveguide,
and the phase slippage between relativistic electrons (v ≈ c) and TM10 mode is ∆(x)dx = α2λ 2
0 /2π2h(x)2dx, where h(x) is the
CPW dimension along y-direction. The matching condition states that the phase slippage in half CPW period must be equal to
λ0/2, i.e.

Equation (10) indicates the dephasing length is very sensitive to the transverse size of CPW, and it should be noted we
have ignored the small transverse motion of laser pulse for simplicity. According to Eq. (10), we know that the longitudinal
dimension of CPW should be chosen around the match condition l1 = Ld ≈ 488λ0, which roughly agrees with our numerical
observations. By scanning over a range of CPW periods, we found the optimal acceleration is obtained for a slightly-shorter
CPW with l1 = 475λ0 as shown in Fig. 4. Apparently the violation of matching condition lead to early saturation which limits
the energy gain. The maximum energy decreases 50% for 25 λ0 deviation from the matched cases.

In conclusion, a novel DLA scheme based on CPW at high laser intensities is proposed and tested by multi-dimension
PIC simulations. Our results indicate that a CPW can be used as an electron accelerator when coupled with state-of-art CO2
laser beams. The proposed scheme demonstrates high acceleration gradient and beam quality, which makes it a promising
candidate for future tabletop accelerator design. In addition, the overall efﬁciency of the scheme is high because the CO2 laser
pulses have high wall-plug efﬁciencies. The underlying physics is discussed using PIC simulations and theoretical analysis, the
matching condition is presented, which agrees with our numerical observation. The integration of longitudinal electric ﬁeld in
one CPW period results in uniform accelerating structure in transverse direction. A quasi-monoenergetic electron bunch with
mean energy 1.5 GeV, r.m.s. energy spread 2% can be obtained within 10-cm acceleration. Meanwhile, when a long electron
beam is injected into the CPW, micro-bunching effect comes into play, which is capable of generating a chain of ultra-fast
electron bunchs with the dimension of half-laser-cycle.

Methods
Due to the computational difﬁculty with simulating the realistic long CO2 laser pulse, we perform three dimensional (3D)
simulation with an relatively small window Lx×Ly×Lz = 12λ0×30λ0×20λ0 focused on the laser-electron interacting position
over half of the CPW period (Lacc = 475λ0 ≈ 0.5 cm) to examine the electron motion between two accelerating phases. The
simulation resolution is dx = 0.04 λ0, dy = dz = 0.08 λ0 in each direction, where λ0 = 10.6µm is the wavelength of CO2 laser.
In 2D simulations, a bigger simulation window (Lx × Ly = 32λ0 × 26λ0) and a ﬁner resolution (dx = 0.02 λ0, dy = 0.05 λ0) are
employed, while other parameters remain the same. The laser pulse in the window is assumed to have a trapezoidal proﬁle in
time with normalized amplitude a0 = 5, which propagates in the positive x direction. The plasma channel wall has a uniform
density of n = 3nc, where nc = meω2
0 /4πe2 is the critical density. It should be noted although the density of MPW is limited by
computational efﬁciency, in real experiments, the laser can hardly penetrate into the area with n > 3nc due to ﬁnite density
gradients. In addition, the CPW contains a uniform low-density (1015 cm−3) plasma to provide necessary focusing for witness
particles, it has little inﬂuence to the accelerating ﬁeld and laser propagation. The witness electron bunch has a ﬂat density
proﬁle in x direction (duration ≈ 4λ0) and a Gaussian proﬁle (FWHM ≈ 2λ0) in transverse direction.
