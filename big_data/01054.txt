A great variety of nonlinear dissipative systems are known to host structures having a correlation
range much shorter than the size of the system. The dynamics of these Localized Structures (LSs)
have been investigated so far in situations featuring parity symmetry. In this letter we extend this
analysis to systems lacking of this property. We show that the LS drifting speed in a parameter
varying landscape is not simply proportional to the parameter gradient, as found in parity preserving
situations. The symmetry breaking implies a new contribution to the velocity ﬁeld which is a
function of the parameter value, thus leading to a new paradigm for LSs manipulation. We illustrate
this general concept by studying the trajectories of the LSs found in a passively mode-locked laser
operated in the localization regime. Moreover, the lack of parity aﬀects signiﬁcantly LSs interactions
which are governed by asymmetrical repulsive forces.

Symmetry breaking (SB) is undoubtedly one of the
most important phenomenon occurring in nature [1–
3]. One distinguishes the situations of spontaneous SB,
where the governing laws are symmetrical but some of
the solutions are not, from the cases of explicit SB where
the symmetry of the underlying theory is broken.
In
Optics, spontaneous SB has been identiﬁed in pattern
formation [4], coupled nanocavities [5], ring lasers [6] and
two dimensional [7] or vectorial [8] solitons. Explicit SB is
known to induce convective instabilities [9–13] and drifts
[14–16] and was recently studied in PT symmetric waveg-
uides [17, 18].

We address here dissipative extended systems hosting
Localized Structures (LSs) which are solutions character-
ized by a correlation length much smaller than the size
of the system making them individually addressable [19–
21]. These states are ubiquitous [22–28] but they are par-
ticularly relevant for applications when implemented in
optical resonators and used as light bits for information
processing [28–31]. Localized structures were observed in
the transverse [32] and longitudinal [33, 34] dimensions
of optical resonators driven by an external ﬁeld, in las-
ing cavities [35, 36] and in optical parametric oscillators
[37, 38]. Several theoretical paradigms have been used to
describe these situations, including the Lugiato-Lefever
[39] and the Rosanov or Ginzburg-Landau equations [40].
All these systems share invariance under the mirror sym-
metry of the variables in which localization occurs. When
LSs are implemented in the transverse section of semicon-
ductor microcavities, an additional equation accounts for
carriers dynamics but it still preserves the overall parity
[32] and the hosted LSs are motionless when the under-
lying medium is homogeneous. Because of translational
invariance, LSs exhibit a Goldstone mode [30, 41] which
is excited by any inhomogeneous parameter variation, in-
ducing their motion [42–44]. Since the velocity, instead
of the acceleration, is proportional to the parameter vari-
ations, the latter is interpreted as an Aristotelian force.
More recently, delayed systems have been analyzed
from the perspective of their equivalence with spatial

extended systems [45] and proposed for hosting LSs,
fronts and chimera states [46–50]. In general, the non-
instantaneous and causal response of the medium implies
a lack of parity in their spatiotemporal representation.
In this letter we show that, in an explicitly parity broken
system, the dynamics of temporal LSs in a modulated
parameter landscape is fundamentally diﬀerent from the
ones found in parity preserving situations. While in the
latter the motion of the LSs depends exclusively on the
parameter gradient, we reveal the existence in the for-
mer of another contribution inducing a dependence of
the velocity ﬁeld on the local parameter value. We con-
sider an experimental situation where this contribution
is dominant and we formulate a new paradigm for LSs
manipulation. Moreover, we show that parity breaking
leads to asymmetrical repelling forces between LSs.

In a parity broken system, traveling waves are the only
possible solutions and the behavior of LSs can be de-
scribed considering a generic partial diﬀerential equation
(PDE) for a ﬁeld E (z, t)

with F a general nonlinear function whose explicit ex-
pression is not needed. We note that equation (1) en-
compasses the cases previously mentioned [39, 40] and we
assume that it supports drifting LSs solutions deﬁned as
E (z, t) = p (z − υt) with p (u) an even function. For the
sake of clarity, Eq.(1) is written in a comoving frame such
that υ (µ0) = 0. Experimentally, when a single parame-
ter is modulated, it may aﬀect several terms of the PDE
and we consider the most general case where the modula-
tion aﬀects an even and an odd derivative, i.e. the linear
gain µ and the drift velocity υ (µ). The inﬂuence of a
small parameter variation µ = µ0 + m (z) can be studied
by a variational approach [51] writing E = p [z − z0 (t)]
which allows ﬁnding that the position z0 of the LS evolves
according to

direct neutral translation modes. Because of the term
(dυ/dµ) coming from SB, the LS speed is proportional
to the local value of the parameter m (z); if this term
is neglected, one recovers the case where LS motion is
purely proportional to the gradient of m (z).

2

These general considerations can be applied to the case
of LSs hosted in a laser ﬁeld E (z, t) coupled to a dis-
tant Saturable Absorber (SA). While this scheme leads
to conventional passive mode-locking (PML) for cavity
roundtrips τ shorter than the gain recovery time τ < τg,
we operate in the long cavity regime τ (cid:29) τg, and for bias
currents below the lasing threshold of the compound sys-
tem.
In this regime the PML pulses become localized,
i.e they become lasing LSs [52] which can be individu-
ally addressed by an optical/electrical perturbation [53].
By denoting G (z, t) the gain and Q (z, t) the saturable
absorption, the Haus equations [54] governing their dy-
namics reads

α and β are the linewidth enhancement factor of the

modulation depth of the SA, s the ratio of the satu-
ration energy of the SA and of the gain sections and

d =(cid:0)2γ2(cid:1)−1 with γ the bandwidth of the spectral ﬁlter.

In Eq.(3), the spatial variable z denotes the propagation
along the cavity axis and corresponds to a fast temporal
scale for the LSs evolution within the cavity roundtrip
while t is the slowly evolving time scale related to the
LSs evolution after each roundtrip. The steady states
of Eqs.(3,4) are the periodic solutions of the PML laser
and Eqs.(3,4) are subject to periodic boundary conditions
(E, G, Q) (z + τ, t) = (E, G, Q) (z, t).

As the Eqs.(4) are only ﬁrst order in z, LSs stem here
from a parity broken PDE and they exhibit a strong drift.
The adiabatic elimination of G and Q would cancel such
a drift and reduce Eq.(3) to the Ginzburg-Landau Equa-
tion. Although in a semiconductor medium the adiabatic
elimination of the absorption may be sound, it cannot be
applied to the gain because τg is much longer than the
pulsewidth τp ∼ γ−1. In our case, the bias current G0
controls at the same time the linear gain, whose expres-

eters are (γ, κ, α, β, Γ, Q0, s) = (40, 0.8, 1, 0.5, 0.04, 0.3, 30).

Expanding E (z − r) in Taylor series in r and integrat-
ing over r leads to an inﬁnite series of even and odd
derivatives of E with respect to z. The odd terms con-
tribute to the drift of the solutions and to SB. This es-
tablishes the conceptual link with the generic situation
depicted in Eq.1.

The Eqs.(3-4) were solved in [52] for the LSs energy;
here we calculate also the LS drift velocity as a function
of the bias current. A typical asymmetrical proﬁle can
be observed in Fig.1(a) while the bifurcation diagrams
´ ∞
are depicted in Fig.1(b,c). The solution branch for the
−∞ |E|2 dz depicted in Fig.1(c)
energy of the pulse P =
shows the typical square root behavior consistent with
the fact that the LSs arise as a saddle-node bifurcation
of limit cycle [52]. Importantly, one notices that the drift
velocity, or equivalently the deviation of the period with
respect to the roundtrip, is a strongly evolving function
of the bias current. The lack of the (z → −z) symme-
try is ultimately a consequence of the causality principle,
because the response of the medium is necessarily asym-
metric with respect to an intensity variation, as shown in
Fig.1(a) and Eq.5.

Experimental evidence of this phenomenon is obtained
using the setup described in [52, 53] and by modulating
the pumping current of a VCSEL mounted in an exter-
nal cavity closed by a resonant saturable absorber mir-
ror. When the modulation frequency νm is almost res-
onant with the cavity free spectral range νc, i.e. small
values of the detuning ∆ = νm − νc, a quasi-stationary
parameter variation is introduced inside the cavity.
In
line with the theoretical analysis, LSs’ dynamics in this
parameter landscape can be pictured using a pseudo
spatio-temporal representation, where the temporal trace
is folded onto itself after a time that corresponds to the
cavity roundtrip ν−1
. Accordingly, the roundtrip number
n becomes a slow time variable proportional to t while

by the modulation and the LS starts to drift in the space-
time diagram, as shown in Fig.3(a,b), in a way reminis-
cent of the Adler unlocking mechanism of a forced oscil-
lator. In the limit of large detuning, the motion becomes
uniform because |υ∆| (cid:29) |υJ|. From the LS time law, ex-
tracted from Fig.3(a), we infer the instantaneous velocity
of the LS in the space-time diagram, that we represent
in Fig.3(c), red curve. On the other hand, the speed can
also be calculated by adding υ∆ + υJ, where the ﬁrst
addendum is obtained from the value of ∆ and the sec-
ond is obtained from the curve υJ (J − Jcw) plotted in
Fig.2(d), using the value of J corresponding to the posi-
tion of the LS on the modulation landscape. The results
obtained are represented in Fig.3(c) using blue dots. The
two curves representing the instantaneous velocity coin-
cide, thus indicating that LS’s speed depends only on the
local current value, while the derivative of the modula-
tion signal is not playing any relevant role.

We realized another experiment using a bivalued rect-
angular current modulation with upper and lower values
Ju,l. Because a large set of current values is spanned at
the pulse rising edge, it becomes an anchoring region for
the LSs for a wide set of values of ∆. Yet, when ∆ falls
outside the locking interval, the LS drifts in the space-
time diagram and it exhibits two clearly diﬀerent speeds
in the regions where J = Ju and J = Jl. This gives
further evidence that LS speed does not depend on the
time derivative of the modulation, otherwise it would be
identical on the two current plateaus.

When several LSs are present into the cavity, inter-
action forces come into play and the current landscape
enables their analysis. The LSs evolution when the
rectangular current modulation is suddenly applied at
roundtrip N = 800 is shown in Fig.4(a). Let us identify
the LSs from 1 to 3 using their position from left to right.
The LS3 acquires a strong negative speed when passing
on the high current plateau as Ju > Jcw while the two
leftmost LSs acquire a positive speed since Jl < Jcw. All
the LSs try to reach the rising edge of the modulation but,
when LS2 and LS3 get too close at N = 4500, repulsive
interaction prevents LS3 to occupy the stable equilibrium
position where υ∆ + υJ = 0 , which is instead occupied

the pseudo-space variable z corresponds to the position
within the roundtrip [45]. However, to simplify the in-
terpretation, we present these diagrams in the reference
frame of the modulation signal, i.e. using a folding pa-
rameter ν−1
m .

We ﬁrst modulate sinusoidally the pumping current
around J = Jcw and we represent in Fig.2(a-c) the evolu-
tion of LS position on the current modulation landscape.

spect to the modulation signal which is located on the

small enough (−4.75 kHz< ∆ < 2.5 kHz), the LS still sits
in a stationary position with respect the modulation sig-
nal. We shows in Fig.2(a,c) that this position gets closer
to the modulation peak (resp. bottom) for increasing
positive (resp. negative) value of ∆. It is worth noting
that all stationary positions found varying ∆ are located
on the positive slope of the modulation. The presence
of a ﬁnite ∆ should induce a drifting speed υ∆ which
in the limit of ∆ (cid:28) νc. The
is given by υ∆ = ∆ν−2
fact that the LS remains locked to stationary positions
in the modulation, as shown in Fig.2(a,c), indicates that
another Aristotelian force equilibrates υ∆.

These results can be explained by assuming that a cur-
rent variation around J = Jcw induces a drifting speed
υJ of the LS which depends on the value of J instead of
its time derivative, as suggested by the theoretical analy-
sis. At each stationary position found for a given ∆ (cid:54)= 0,
υ∆ is compensated by an opposite drifting speed induced
by current variation υJ such that υ∆ + υJ = 0. Ac-
cordingly, from the value of the current at the stationary
positions, it is possible to establish the dependence of υJ
on (J − Jcw), as shown in Fig.2(d). In agreement with
the theory, υJ is a decreasing function of J. This explains
why the stable equilibrium points are located only on the
positive slope of the modulation: J plays a restoring (di-
verging) role on positive (negative) slope with respect to
deviations from the equilibrium point.

For values of ∆ outside the above speciﬁed interval, υ∆
cannot be balanced by υJ at any current values spanned

by LS2. Hence, LS3 sits at a position shifted of 0.8 ns,
where the repulsive force generated by LS2 force balances
the Aristotelian forces υ∆ + υJ (Ju − Jcw). This situation
further evolves (not shown in Fig.4(a)) when LS1 reaches
the rising front and pushes the other two LSs to the right
to occupy the position previously occupied by LS2. The
three LSs then remain eventually gathered around the
rising front of the electrical pulse at a mutual distance
of 0.8 ns. This situation is similar to the one shown in
Fig.4(b) before the modulation is removed at N = 1200.
Hereafter, the LSs evolve exclusively under the action
of repulsive forces and their dynamics reveal that the
action-reaction principle is violated as for instance LS1
interacts with LS2 but not vice-versa. The asymmetry
of the interaction is due to the broken parity and follows
from the causality principle.

Such a dynamics in a modulated parameter landscape
can be theoretically analyzed with the results of Fig.1.
Close to the saddle-node bifurcation, we approximate the
drift as a function of the current as

υ = fυ (G0) = υ0 + ∆υ

coeﬃcients
(υ0, ∆υ, P0, ∆P ) and Gsn are given by the bifurcation
diagram of a single LS in Fig.1(b,c).
In the comov-
ing frame of the external periodic potential, the equa-
tion for the relative drift velocity Eq.(6) transforms into
˜υ + υ∆ = fυ (G0) with υ∆ the velocity of the drifting po-
tential and ˜υ the residual speed. In this reference frame,
the external potential depends only on the fast time z
and not anymore on the slow time t. As the characteris-
tics of the PML pulses depend only on the gain value at
the leading edge G(i), we replace in Eq.(6) G0 → G(i).
During the gain depletion occurring around the pulse,
the so-called fast stage, only the strongly nonlinear stim-
ulated terms in Eqs.(4) are relevant and the gain at the
falling edge of the LS is simply G(f ) = G(i) exp (−P ).
Provided that the variations of the bias current G0 (z)

are slower than τg, the solution of the carrier equation in
between LSs reads

G (z2) = G (z1) e−ΓD2 + G0 (z2)(cid:0)1 − e−ΓD2(cid:1) ,

with Dn = zn − zn−1 and G (z1) an arbitrary initial con-
dition. By denoting as zn the position of the n-th LS
whose residual velocity is ˜υn = dzn/dt we ﬁnd that

For N−LSs with n ∈ [1, . . . , N ], the periodic bound-
ary conditions linking the gain depletion of the rightmost
LS to the dynamics of the leftmost is z0 = zN − τ. The
repulsive interactions mediated by the gain depletion is
exempliﬁed in Fig.4c), where, as shown in the experi-
ment, LSn aﬀects LSn+1 but not vice-versa. The source
of the asymmetry is visible in Eq.(9) and the interactions
are repulsive since the velocity is a decreasing function
of the current (∆υ < 0).

In conclusion, we described the dynamics of LSs in
systems with an explicitly broken parity symmetry ap-
pearing because of the causality principle. Our analysis
reveals that the Aristotelian forces ruling their dynam-
ical behavior are very diﬀerent from the ones found in
parity preserving conditions. These results pave the way
towards control and manipulation of LSs for information
processing in broken parity systems and in particular to
the control of three dimensional light bullets in semicon-
ductor lasers [55].
