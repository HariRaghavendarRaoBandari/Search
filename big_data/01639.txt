Geometrically non-Higgsable seven-branes carry gauge sectors that cannot be broken by

complex structure deformation, and there is growing evidence that such conﬁgurations

are typical in F-theory. We study strongly coupled physics associated with these branes.

Axiodilaton proﬁles are computed using Ramanujan’s theories of elliptic functions to alter-

native bases, showing explicitly that the string coupling is O(1) in the vicinity of the brane;

that it sources nilpotent SL(2, Z) monodromy and therefore the associated brane charges

are modular; and that essentially all F-theory compactiﬁcations have regions with order

one string coupling. It is shown that non-perturbative SU(3) and SU(2) seven-branes are

related to weakly coupled counterparts with D7-branes via deformation-induced Hanany-

Witten moves on (p, q) string junctions that turn them into fundamental open strings; only

the former may exist for generic complex structure. D3-brane near these and the Kodaira

type II seven-branes probe Argyres-Douglas theories. The BPS states of slightly deformed

theories are shown to be dyonic string junctions.

Gauge sectors can arise along coincident seven-branes in type IIB and F-theory [1] compact-

iﬁcations, in which case the splitting of branes gives rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking

via the Higgs mechanism. In the geometric F-theory description of such setups this process

is determined by the complex structure of a Calabi-Yau elliptic ﬁbration X π−→ B, and in

some cases there are complex structure deformations that break the gauge group G to a

subgroup. If the deformation is small the massive W-bosons of the broken theory are (p, q)

string junctions [2,3]; connections between deformations, junctions, and Higgsing have been

explored in recent physics works [4, 5] and rigorous mathematical proofs [6]. Recent counts

of ﬂux vacua [7] show that obtaining gauge symmetry on seven-branes by specialization in

moduli space is statistically very costly, which could have landscape implications.

It has been known for many years [8] that sometimes there are no complex structure

deformations that break G,

in which case the theory exhibits seven-branes with gauge

group G for generic complex structure. This could be important for moduli stabilization [9].

These have been called non-Higgsable seven-branes and sometimes many such intersecting

branes exist, giving non-Higgsable clusters. This name is particularly apt in six-dimensional

compactiﬁcations, where the only known source of symmetry breaking is complex structure

deformation, so the low energy theory cannot be Higgsed. There are other sources of

symmetry breaking in four dimensional compactiﬁcations, such as ﬂux and T-branes [10],

so that the non-Higgsable seven-branes are more appropriately called geometrically non-

Higgsable. Having stated the caveats, we will henceforth use non-Higgsable, for brevity.

Based on a number of works [9, 11–16] in recent years, there is growing evidence [9, 11,

15, 16] that non-Higgsable seven-branes and non-Higgsable clusters are generic in six- and

four-dimensional compactiﬁcations of F-theory. This evidence arises from both abstract

argumentation and large datasets, as will be reviewed in section 2.

Given their prevalence, the purpose of this paper is to study a number of aspects of non-
Higgsable seven-branes. These branes always have Kodaira ﬁbers of type II, III, IV, I∗0 , IV ∗,
III∗, or II∗, and the results of this paper hold for seven-branes with these ﬁbers, regardless
of whether or not they are non-Higgsable. We will focus on the strongly coupled physics

that exists in the vicinity of the brane. Axiodilaton proﬁles will be studied using Ra-

manujan’s theories of elliptic functions to alternative bases in section 3. Non-perturbative

seven-branes that realize SU(3) and SU(2) are studied in section 4; these are the only ge-

ometric SU(N) groups that may exist for generic complex structure. Conﬁgurations where

three seven-branes necessarily intersect in codimension two in B are studied in section 5,

and theories on D3-brane probes of non-Higgsable seven-branes are studied in section 6.

2. Review of Geometrically Non-Higgsable Seven-branes

We will study seven-branes using their geometric description in F-theory. There the ax-
iodilaton τ = C0 + i e−φ of the type IIB theory is considered to be the complex structure
modulus of an auxiliary elliptic curve which is ﬁbered over the compact extra dimensional

space B. Such a structure is determined by a Calabi-Yau fourfold X which is elliptically
ﬁbered π : X → B. An elliptic ﬁbration with section is birationally equivalent [17] to a
Weierstrass model

y2 = x3 + f x + g

(2.1)

where f and g are sections of K−4
B , respectively, with KB the anticanonical bundle
on B. The ﬁbers π−1(p) are smooth elliptic curves for any point p which is not in the
discriminant locus

B and K−6

∆ = 4 f 3 + 27 g2 = 0.

(2.2)

On the other hand if p is a generic point in the codimension one locus ∆ = 0, then π−1(p)
is one of the singular ﬁbers classiﬁed by Kodaira [18].

Seven-branes are located along ∆ = 0. Their precise nature depends on the structure of

f and g and therefore also ∆, which may be an irreducible eﬀective divisor or comprised

of components

Taking a loop around ∆ or any component ∆i = 0 induces an SL(2, Z) monodromy on the
associated type IIB supergravity theory. The action on τ is

∆i.

(2.3)

∆ =Yi

τ 7→

aτ + b
cτ + d

,

M = a b

c d! ∈ SL(2, Z).

(2.4)

Seven-brane structure is determined by the Weierstrass model according to the order of van-
ishing of f , g, and ∆ along the seven-brane. Often in this paper some ∆i = zN , and there-
fore we will denote the associated orders of vanishing as ordz(f, g, ∆) as a three-tuple or in
terms of the individual orders ordz(f ), ordz(g), and ordz(∆). From this data the singularity
type, SL(2, Z) monodromy, and non-abelian symmetry algebra (up to outer monodromy)

can be determined; see Table 1. This is the geometric symmetry group, henceforth sym-

metry group or gauge group, along the seven-brane in the absence of symmetry-breaking

G-ﬂux. The structure of ∆ is determined by f, g and there is a moduli space of such

choices that corresponds to the complex structure of X. Gauge sectors along seven-branes

can be engineered by tuning f and g relative to their generic structures.

odromy order.

Let us now turn to geometrically non-Higgsable seven-branes. Physically, this means

that there are no directions in the supersymmetric moduli space that break the gauge group

on the seven-branes by splitting them up. Mathematically, a geometrically non-Higgsable

seven-brane along z = 0 exists when

∆ = zN ˜∆

(2.5)

for any choice of f and g, i.e.
for a generic point in the complex structure moduli space
of X, henceforth Mcs(X). For N > 2 the seven-brane carries a non-trivial gauge group G.
It is often possible that by tuning f, g to a subvariety L ⊂ Mcs(X) the discriminant ∆ is
proportional to zM >N and the gauge group along the seven-brane at z = 0 is enhanced to
G′ ⊃ G. There may be many such loci Li in Mcs(X). The statement that a non-Higgsable

4

seven-brane exists for generic complex structure moduli is the statement that it exists for

any complex structure in Mcs(X) \ {Si Li}, which is the bulk of Mcs(X) since each Li

has non-trivial codimension. Often the discriminant is of the form

∆ = ˜∆ Yi

zNi
i

(2.6)

for generic complex structure, in which case there is a non-Higgsable seven-brane along each
locus zi = 0. They may intersect, giving rise to product group gauge sectors with jointly
charged matter that arise from clusters of intersecting seven-branes. These are referred to

as non-Higgsable clusters [11, 12].

The possible gauge groups that may arise along a non-Higgsable seven-brane are E8, E7, E6, F4, SO(8), S

and SU(2) and there are ﬁve two-factor products with jointly charged matter that may
arise. In particular, note that SU(5) and SO(10), which arise from I5 and I∗1 ﬁbers, may
never be non-Higgsable; more generally, this is true of seven-branes with ﬁbers In and
I∗n>0. This is easy to see in the In case. Such a model has ordz(f, g, ∆) = (0, 0, n), and
f 7→ (1 + ǫ)f for ǫ ∈ C∗ is a symmetry breaking complex structure deformation that always
exists, by virtue of the model existing in the ﬁrst place. Similar arguments exist for I∗n>0
ﬁbers.

The name “non-Higgsable clusters” is a suitable name in six-dimensional compactiﬁca-

tions of F-theory, since there the associated six-dimensional gauge sectors do not have any

symmetry breaking ﬂat directions in the supersymmetric moduli space, as determined by
Mcs(X) and also the low energy degrees of freedom. However, in four dimensional com-
pactiﬁcations there are other eﬀects such as T-branes [10] that may break the gauge group,
so that geometrically non-Higgsable is a more accurate name. Furthermore, if ∆ ∼ z2 for
a generic p ∈ Mcs(X) then G = ∅ even though there is a divisor z = 0 in B that is
singular, and sometimes a codimension two locus C may be singular for generic moduli

even if it is not contained in a non-Higgsable seven-brane. Both have been referred to

as “non-Higgsable structure” [15] even though there is no associated gauge group. The

general feature is the existence of singular structure for generic complex structure moduli,

and aside from these two caveats there is a gauge group on a seven-brane that cannot be

spontaneously broken by a complex structure deformation.

Though not named as such at the time, the ﬁrst F-theory compactiﬁcations with non-

Higgsable seven-branes appeared in [19]. These examples have six non-compact dimensions
and four compact dimensions B2 with B2 = Fn, and there is a non-Higgsable seven-brane
on the −n curve in Fn for n > 2. The complete set of non-Higgsable clusters and seven-
branes that may arise in six-dimensional compactiﬁcations were classiﬁed in [12] and the

5

examples with toric B2 were classiﬁed in [11].
examples exhibit non-Higgsable clusters or seven-branes, and the 16 that do not are weak
Fano varieties, i.e. varieties satisfying −K · C ≥ 0 for any holomorphic curve C.
cases in six dimensions the reason for geometric non-Higgsability is immediately evident in

In the latter, all but 16 of the 61, 539

In all

the low energy gauge theory: either there is no matter or there is not enough matter to

allow for Higgsing consistent with supersymmetry, due to having a half hypermultiplet in

a pseudoreal representation.

In examples with four non-compact dimensions the extra dimensions of space are a
complex threefold B3 and there are additional non-Higgsable clusters and structures that
do not appear in six dimensions,
including for example loops [14] and the gauge group
SU(3)× SU(2) [9]. In the latter case the matter content matches the non-abelian structure
of the standard model. A classiﬁcation [15] of B3 that are P1-bundles over certain toric
surfaces has non-Higgsable clusters for 98.3% of the roughly 100, 000 examples with over
500 examples with an SU(3) × SU(2) sector. A broader exploration of toric B3 using
Monte Carlo techniques [16] has non-Higgsable structure for all B3 after an appropriate
“thermalization,” and approximately 76% of the examples have a non-Higgsable SU(3) ×
SU(2) sector. Non-Higgsable clusters also appear in the F-theory geometry with the largest

number of currently known ﬂux vacua [20], where vacuum counts were estimated using

techniques of Ashok, Denef, and Douglas [21]. It is not clear whether cosmological evolution
prefers the special vacua associated with a typical B3, perhaps characterized by [22], or the
typical vacua associated with a special base B that gives the largest number of ﬂux vacua,
which may be Bmax of [20]. Needless to say, this is a fascinating question moving forward.
What is becoming clear is that non-Higgsable clusters and structure play a very impor-

tant role in the landscape of F-theory compactiﬁcations. It has become common to say that

non-Higgsable clusters are doubly generic. The ﬁrst is a strong sense: for ﬁxed B, having

a non-Higgsable cluster means that there is a non-trivial seven-brane for generic points in
Mcs(X). The second is in a weaker, but still compelling, sense: there is growing evidence
that generic extra dimensional spaces B give rise to non-Higgsable clusters or structure.

One line of evidence is in the large datasets cited above. Another is the argument of [15]:
if there is a curve C ⊂ B with −K · C < 0 then −K contains C and C sits inside the
discriminant locus, giving non-Higgsable structure on C. Such B are ones that are not

weak Fano, and it is expected that a generic algebraic surface or threefold is of this type.

In particular, there are only 105 topologically distinct Fano threefolds.

6

In this work we will study the strongly coupled physics associated to ﬁbers that can

give rise to geometrically non-Higgsable seven-branes. As such, the analyses of this paper

include, but are not limited to, F-theory compactiﬁcations with non-Higgsable seven-branes.

These ﬁbers are

II, III, IV, I∗0 , IV ∗, III∗, II∗,

(2.7)

and any seven-brane with one of these has an associated SL(2, Z) monodromy matrix M
that is nilpotent, i.e. M k = 1 for some k. MI ∗
0 = −1 which acts trivially on τ , indicating
that this conﬁguration is uncharged, in agreement with the fact that it is 4 D7-branes on

top of an O7 plane from the type IIB point of view. The rest act non-trivially on τ but the

theory comes back to itself after taking k loops around the seven-brane; the seven-brane

charges are nilpotent. Though our analyses apply more broadly, they are of particular

interest given the prevalence of non-Higgsable clusters in the landscape.

3. Axiodilaton Proﬁles and Strong Coupling

The primary diﬀerence between F-theory and the weakly coupled type IIB string is that the
axiodilaton τ = C0+ie−φ varies over B in F-theory, and therefore so does the string coupling
gs = ehφi. The behavior of τ near seven-branes aﬀects gauge theories on seven-branes, as
well as three-brane gauge theories or string scattering in the vicinity of seven-branes. In

his seminal works [18] Kodaira computed τ locally near seven-branes in elliptic surfaces.

In this section we will study axiodilaton proﬁles via their relation to the Klein j-

invariant of an elliptic curve for elliptic ﬁbrations of arbitrary dimension. We will normalize

the j-invariant in a standard way by J := j/1728, and in the case of a Weierstrass model

we have

J =

4f 3
∆

where

∆ = 4f 3 + 27g2.

(3.1)

In this formulation the J-invariant depends on base coordinates according to the sections

f and g of the Weierstrass model. However, J also depends on the ratio of periods of the
elliptic curve τ = ω1
ω2
if z is a base coordinate we compute J = J(z) directly from the Weierstrass model, but this

where τ is the value of the axiodilaton ﬁeld at each point in B. Thus,

can also be thought of as J = J(τ (z)). By inverting the J-function, we will determine the

axiodilaton proﬁle and study it in the vicinity of geometrically non-Higgsable seven-branes.

We will also demonstrate that F-theory compactiﬁcations generically exhibit regions with

O(1) string coupling and recover classic results from the perturbative type IIB theory.

Table 2: The J-invariant for seven-branes associated to geometrically non-Higgsable clus-

ters, expressed in a way that is particularly useful for a local analysis near the seven-brane.
Here f = zn F and g = zm G with A = 27G2/4F 3.

Though there are seven Kodaira ﬁber types that may give rise to geometrically non-
Higgsable seven-branes, {II, III, IV, I∗0, IV ∗, III∗, II∗}, some have the same J-invariant
and τ in the vicinity of the brane. In each case the Weierstrass model takes the form

f = zn F,

g = zm G,

∆ = zmin(3n,2m) ˜∆,

(3.2)

and the J-invariant takes a simple form. Near a generic region of the seven-brane on z = 0
both F and G are non-zero, and therefore so is A ≡ 27G2/4F 3. The possibilities are
computed in Table 2 and the redundancies are [18]

JII = JIV ∗,

JIII = JIII ∗,

JIV = JII ∗.

(3.3)

This result may seem at odds with the monodromy order for these Kodaira ﬁbers displayed
in Table 1, since the type II and II∗ ﬁbers have order 6 whereas the type IV and IV ∗
ﬁbers have order 3. The resolution is that, though the monodromy associated with type
II and II∗ ﬁbers is 6, M 3
II ∗ = −I, where I is the identity matrix, so that the type
II, II∗, IV , and IV ∗ ﬁbers all induce an order 3 action on τ .

II = M 3

There are some special values for τ (J) that we will see arise in inverting J,

τ (0) = eπi/3,

τ (1) = i,

(3.4)

up to an SL(2, Z) transformation. These values correspond to gs = 2√3
and gs = 1, and
it is important physically that these cannot be lowered by an SL(2, Z) transformation.

showing that the string couplings with these two values of τ cannot be lowered by a global

SL(2, Z) transformation.

For each case in Table 2 we will invert J to solve for τ .

3.1. Inverting the J-function and Ramanujan’s Alternative Bases

There is a nineteenth century procedure for inverting the J-function that is due to Jacobi.

Recall that the j-invariant satisﬁes

j(q) =

1
q

+ 744 + 196884 q + . . .

(3.6)

in terms of q = e2πiτ . Jacobi’s result relates j to q via hypergeometric functions, which
then allows for the computation of τ by taking a logarithm. The result is

τ = i

2F1( 1

2 , 1
2F1( 1

2 ; 1; 1 − x)
2, 1
2; 1; x)

,

J =

4 (1 − x(1 − x))3
27 x2(1 − x)2

,

(3.7)

in terms of the hypergeometric function 2F1(a, b, c; x). For |x| < 1 it satisﬁes

2F1(a, b; c; x) =

(a)n(b)n
(c)n n!

xn,

(3.8)

∞

Xn=0

where (a)n = a(a + 1)(a + 2) . . . (a + n − 1) for n ∈ Z+ is the Pochhammer symbol. For
a particular value of J, then, six values of τ are obtained by solving the sextic in x, and

these are related to one another by SL(2, Z) transformations.

Much progress was made in the theory of elliptic functions at the beginning of the 20th
century by Ramanujan, who recorded his theorems in notebooks [23] that were dense with

results. In one, he claimed that there are similar inversion formulas where the base q is

not

as it was for Jacobi, but is instead one of

q = exp(cid:18)−π 2F1(1/2, 1/2, 1, 1 − x)
2F1(1/2, 1/2, 1, x) (cid:19)
2F1(1/3, 2/3, 1, x) (cid:19) ,
q = exp(cid:18)−
2F1(1/3, 2/3, 1, 1 − x)
2F1(1/4, 3/4, 1, x) (cid:19) ,
q = exp(cid:18)−
2F1(1/4, 3/4, 1, 1 − x)
2F1(1/6, 5/6, 1, x) (cid:19) .

There has been signiﬁcant progress [24, 25] in the study of Ramanujan’s theories of elliptic

functions to these alternative bases in recent years, including rigorous proofs of many of

Ramanujan’s results. Practically, these diﬀerent theories give diﬀerent ways to study τ .

In studying the relationship between J, τ , and Ramanujan’s alternative theories, we

will utilize the notation of Cooper [25]. The alternative bases satisfy

qr := exp(cid:18)−2π
√r

2F1(ar, 1 − ar; 1; xr) (cid:19)
2F1(ar, 1 − ar; 1; 1 − xr)

(3.11)

4, and a3 = 1

3 for r = 1, 2, 3 reproduce (3.10), where the J invariant

satisﬁes

4 x1(1 − x1)

(1 + 3x2)3

27 x2(1 − x2)2 =

(1 + 8x3)3

64 x3(1 − x3)3 .

(3.12)

For any value of J one may then solve either Jacobi’s sextic (3.7) or the quadratic, cubic,

or quartic in (3.12). Other inversion methods also exist, but we will not use them.

We utilize these methods to study elliptic ﬁbrations, beginning with general statements

and then proceeding to the study of examples near geometrically non-Higgsable seven-

branes.

Consider a Weierstrass model, where J = 4f 3/∆. In a neighborhood of a seven-brane
on z = 0 one can compute the SL(2, Z) monodromy M of the seven-brane by taking a

small loop around the seven-brane, which includes an action on τ . Recalling that

M k(τ ) = τ

(3.13)

for some k for any geometrically non-Higgsable seven-brane, one would like to verify k

directly by inverting the J-function. We will see that some of Ramanujan’s theories give

rise to k element sets of τ values that are permuted by the monodromy, where k is the
order of xi in (3.12).

Since each solution for xi determines a value of τ directly via q in (3.11), let us solve

for xi in terms of J. In the quadratic case we have

x1 =

1 ±p1 − 1/J

2

(3.14)

which is degenerate for J = 1 and is not well deﬁned for J = 0. Aside from I∗0 , these are
J-invariants associated with geometrically non-Higgsable seven-branes.

In the cubic case we solve the equation

27(J − 1) x3

2 − 27(J + 2) x2
10

2 + 9(3J − 1) x2 − 1 = 0

to obtain x2. Rather than solving this cubic exactly, let study the behavior of this cubic
near J = 0 and J = 1, since this is the relevant structure near non-Higgsable seven-branes.
Expanding around J = 0 by taking J = δJ0 ≪ 1 the three solutions for x2 near J = 0 are

(3.16)

and we see that the three roots are permuted by an order three monodromy upon taking
a small loop around J = 0. Near J = 1 we take J = 1 + δJ1 with δJ1 ≪ 1 and compute

x2 =

from which we see that one of the solutions goes to inﬁnity at J = 1 (as is expected since

the cubic reduces to a quadratic when J = 1), whereas the other two are permuted by an

order two monodromy around J = 0.

Therefore, we will study seven-brane theories with J = 1 (J = 0) with Ramanujan’s

theory where J is quadratic (cubic) in x1 (x2), solving for τ .

3.2. Warmup: Reviewing Weakly Coupled Cases

Before proceeding to the interesting seven-brane structures that may be non-Higgsable, all

of which have ﬁnite J-invariant, let us consider the seven-branes that may appear in the
weakly coupled type IIB theory, which have J = ∞.

Let us begin with the case of n coincident D7-branes, which in F-theory language have

a Kodaira ﬁber In. The Weierstrass model takes takes the form

f = F,

g = G,

∆ = zn ˜∆,

(3.18)

where we have used our common notation of inserting F in f (and G in g) even though
f, g ∼ z0 in this case, and z does not divide ˜∆. Instead, F and G must be tuned to ensure
the form of ∆. The J-invariant is

J(In) =

4F 3
zn ˜∆

=:

C
zn ,

(3.19)

and we can see that, indeed, J = ∞ at z = 0. Solving the theory where J is a quadratic
in x1 gives

and then using equation (3.11) to compute τ (α−) and Taylor expanding we ﬁnd

x1 =

1
2 ±

τ (α−) =

n log(z)

(3.20)

(3.21)

which induces a monodromy τ 7→ τ + n upon encircling z = 0. This is the expected
monodromy of a stack of n D7-branes. The other solution τ (α+) is S-dual to τ (α−).

Now consider n ≥ 4 D7-branes that are on top of an O7-plane, which in F-theory

language corresponds to an I∗n−4 ﬁber. In this case the Weierstrass model is

with J-invariant

f = z2F,

g = z3G,

∆ = z2+n ˜∆,

J(I∗n−4) =

4F 3
zn−4 ˜∆

=:

C
zn−4 .

(3.22)

(3.23)

Then again solving the theory where J is a quadratic in x1 we obtain (with similar α±)

τ (α−) =

(n − 4) log(z)

2πi

+ · · · ,

(3.24)

and there is a monodromy τ 7→ τ + n − 4 upon encircling z = 0. This is the monodromy
expected for n D7-branes on top of an O7-plane, and famously there is no monodromy in

the case n = 4, since the 4 D7-branes cancel the charge of the O7-plane.

3.3. Axiodilaton Proﬁles Near Seven-Branes with J = 1

From Tables 1 and 2 we see that the seven-branes with J = 1 have ﬁber of Kodaira type
III and III∗, which carry gauge symmetry SU(2) and E7, respectively. In both cases we
have the same local structure of the J-invariant

Using equation (3.14) we see

J(III) = J(III∗) =

x1 =

(3.25)

(3.26)

which exhibits a Z2 monodromy around z = 0 that induces a monodromy on τ . Using the
relationship (3.11) between q2πiτ and x1 we compute two values for τ

τ± = i

2F1( 1
2F1( 1

6, 5
6, 5

6, 1, α+)

Since the Z2 monodromy swaps α±, it also swaps τ± and noting τ− = −1/τ+ we see

τ± 7→ τ∓ = −

τ±

(3.27)

(3.28)

under the monodromy. This matches the behavior associated with the monodromy matrices

and we have seen the result by explicitly solving for the axiodilaton τ . Note that this

monodromy is precisely an S-duality, which therefore also swaps electrons and monopoles

represented by (p, q)-strings to D3-brane probes.

How does the physics, in particular the string coupling, change upon moving away from

the seven-brane? Expanding the exact solution (3.17) near z = 0 we obtain

where

τ± = i ± B√Az −

(3.31)

is a constant that depends on values of the Euler Γ function but A = 27G2/4F 3 depends
on the location in the base. We see that τ (z) satisﬁes τ (0) = i and

gs,± ≃

1 ± B Im(√Az) − 1

2 B2Re(Az)

1

.

(3.32)

(3.33)

Close to z = 0 we have

gs,± ≃

1 ± B Im(√Az)

,

and we see that the monodromy exchanges a more weakly coupled theory with a more
strongly coupled theory, where the deviation from gs = 1 depends on the model-dependent
factor A and the separation z from the brane. This was also implicit from τ 7→ −1/τ .

We see directly that the string coupling gs ≃ O(1) in the vicinity of the type III and
type III∗ seven-branes carrying SU(2) and E7 gauge symmetry, respectively, and that
Ramanujan’s theory where J is a quadratic in x1 gives a set of τ values permuted by the
brane-sourced monodromy. From (3.5), an SL(2, Z) transformation cannot make the theory

weakly coupled in this region.

In the previous section we saw that this method is more natural than the theory where
J is cubic in x2 since the SL(2, Z) monodromy of the type III and III∗ Kodaira ﬁbers is
Z2 rather than Z3. For completeness, though, inverting using the cubic theory gives three
solutions for x2

where we see that the ﬁrst solution decouples near z = 0 and one is left with the latter
two solutions, which we will call β±. There is a Z2 monodromy that exchanges β± upon

13

encircling z = 0. Deﬁning τ± for the cubic theory as τ± ≡ τ (β±) we have

and, though direct evaluation gives τ± = i at z = 0, the monodromy τ 7→ − 1
immediate, instead requiring the use of some identities for the hypergeometric function for
an exact expression. We have veriﬁed via Taylor expansion that τ± are swapped by a Z2
monodromy, however. Thus, the theory quadratic in x1 seems better suited to study III
and III∗ ﬁbers.

3.4. Axiodilaton Proﬁles Near Seven-Branes with J = 0

We now turn to the study of seven-branes with Kodaira ﬁbers satisfying J = 0. From

Tables 1 and 2 we see that the seven-branes with J = 0 have general ﬁber of Kodaira
type II, II∗, IV , and IV ∗. The seven-branes of the ﬁrst two types carry no geometric
gauge symmetry and E8, respectively, whereas the latter two exhibit SU(3) (SU(2)) and
E6 (F4) geometric gauge symmetry respectively, if the geometry does not (does) exhibit
outer-monodromy that reduces the rank of the gauge group. Recall that

J(II) = J(IV ∗) =

z

A + z

,

J(II∗) = J(IV ) =

z2

A + z2 ,

(3.36)

and that there is no discrepancy in this matching because, though the SL(2, Z) monodromy

associated with these ﬁbers are either order 3 or 6, they are only order 3 on τ .

Let us utilize the theory where J is a cubic in x2 to study τ near these seven-branes,
beginning with the cases of a type II and IV ∗ ﬁber since these have the same local
structure of J-invariant. The expansion of the three solutions to the cubic in x2 expanded
around z = 0 are

from which we see a Z3 monodromy upon encircling the seven-brane at z = 0. Letting βn
be the x2 solution for each n ∈ {0, 1, 2}, we have
2F1( 1

If the τ values are distinct then there is an order 3 SL(2, Z) monodromy on τ , but its
determining that its precise action is τ 7→ τ−1
τ would require using some identities of
hypergeometric functions, unlike in the case of the type III and III∗ seven-branes where its

14

action τ 7→ −1/τ was immediately clear. Instead we will prove the monodromy numerically
in a power series in z. Numerically at leading order in z and keeping four signiﬁcant ﬁgures
in z1/3, we have

(3.39)

We encircle z = 0 by writing z = reiθ where r ∈ R is a small positive number and then
varying θ. There is a choice of direction: encircling by taking θ from 0 to 2π we see that
τ0 7→ τ1, τ1 7→ τ2, τ2 7→ τ0, whereas going in the other direction by taking θ from 0 to −2π
gives the inverse action τ0 7→ τ2, τ1 7→ τ0, τ2 7→ τ1. One can verify that this latter action
corresponds to the monodromy τ 7→ τ−1

= τi−1 where τ−1 := τ2.

Now consider the cases of seven-branes with a type II∗ and type IV ﬁber. From (3.36)
we see that this diﬀers from the analysis we just performed by the replacement z 7→ z2, as
can be veriﬁed by direct computation. The solutions to the cubic are

we have

(3.41)

Note that the monodromy action has changed, though: upon taking θ from 0 to 2π we have
τ0 7→ τ2, τ1 7→ τ0, τ2 7→ τ1. In the type II, IV ∗ case this was the monodromy associated
with taking θ from 0 to −2π. We see explicitly that the SL(2, Z) monodromy of II/IV ∗
ﬁbers induce the inverse action on τ compared to II∗/IV ﬁbers. This is as expected since

and the fact

MII = M−1
II ∗,

MIV = M−1
IV ∗

MII = −MIV ∗.

MII ∗ = −MIV

15

(3.42)

(3.43)

implies that II and IV ∗ induce the same action on τ , and similarly for II∗ and IV .

Given these explicit solutions for τ one can solve for gs as a function of the local
coordinate z near the seven-branes with type II, IV ∗, II∗, or IV ﬁbers and determine its
falloﬀ from the central value gs = 2/√3 at z = 0.

3.5. The Genericity of Strongly Coupled Regions in F-theory and the Sen Limit

In this section we would like to demonstrate the genericity of strongly coupled regions in

F-theory. This statement is immediately plausible since F-theory is a generalization of the

weakly coupled type IIB string with varying axiodilaton, but we would like to argue that
there are regions with O(1) gs for nearly all of the moduli space of F-theory using two
concrete lines of evidence, one that utilizes non-Higgsable clusters and one that does not.

Recall from section 2 that there is growing evidence and argumentation that nearly all

extra dimensional topologies B give rise to geometrically non-Higgsable structure, and it

is typically the case that those have geometrically non-Higgsable seven-branes. The latter

have a Kodaira ﬁber in the set

{II, III, IV, I∗0 , IV ∗, III∗, II∗}

(3.44)

and for all but1 I∗0 the axiodilaton is strongly coupled in the vicinity of the seven-brane, as
seen using the explicit solutions of section 3. If the argumentation regarding the genericity

of non-Higgsable clusters is correct and a typical compactiﬁcation has a non-Higgsable
seven-brane with ﬁber II, III, IV, IV ∗, III∗, or II∗, then there are regions with O(1) gs
for most of the moduli space of F-theory.

However, there are regions with O(1) gs quite generally even in the absence of non-
Higgsable clusters. Consider a completely general Weierstrass model, which has a J-

invariant

J =

4f 3

4f 3 + 27g2 .

(3.45)

In some cases f and g may be reducible (e.g.

if there are non-Higgsable clusters), but it

need not be so and it will not aﬀect the following calculation. There are two special loci

in this generic geometry, f = 0 and g = 0, and on these loci

J|f =0 = 0,

J|g=0 = 1.

(3.46)

1It would also be interesting to understand whether a non-Higgsable seven-brane with I ∗

0 ﬁber, which
could have gauge group SO(8), SO(7), or G2, necessarily forbids a Sen limit; certainly if it is Higgsable, such
a limit can exist.

16

Since we have seen its utility for studying loci with J = 1, consider Ramanujan’s theory
in which J is a quadratic in x1. Then we have

3i√3g
4f 3/2 =: α±

6, 1, α−)

.

which is the same form as for seven-branes with type III or III∗ Kodaira ﬁbers as in
(3.27), though α± have diﬀerent forms which critically change the physics. For example,
the change in α± changes the local structure of τ to

τ± = i ± B

g
f 3/2 + O(g2)

(3.49)

12 )Γ( 11
12 )
12 )Γ( 17

where here B = 5 Γ( 7
12 ) ≃ .68542, and we see (at leading order2) that there is no
8√3 Γ( 13
monodromy associated with taking a loop around g = 0 for f 6= 0. This makes physical
sense, because such a locus has no seven-branes, and therefore no source for τ -monodromy!
Nevertheless, the region g = 0 is strongly coupled: at g = 0, α+ = α−, τ = i, and therefore
gs = 1. Similar results can be obtained using the x2 theory to solve for τ near f = 0, and
in that case x2 has three solutions that give τ = eπi/3, and therefore gs = 2√3

at f = 0.

These facts about strong coupling are quite general, independent of the existence or
non-existence of any non-trivial seven-brane structure (i.e. with ﬁber other than I1). They
hold even for completely smooth models, such as the generic Weierstrass model over P3.

What happens to these strongly coupled regions in the Sen limit? Roughly, the Sen
limit [26] is a weakly coupled limit in moduli space where J 7→ ∞ and therefore τ 7→ i∞,
so gs 7→ 0. This occurs because the Weierstrass model takes the form f = Cη − 3h2,
g = h (Cη − 2h2) with discriminant

∆ = C 2η2(4Cη − 9h2)

(3.50)

where η and h are sections and C is a parameter. Sen’s weak coupling limit is the C 7→ 0
limit. However, note that if C is very small but non-zero

J =

4f 3

C 2η2(4Cη − 9h2)

=

4 (Cη − 3h2)3
C 2η2 (4Cη − 9h2)

(3.51)

2This is extended to all orders by the fact that the power series expansion for 2F1(a, b; c; x) holds for

|x| < 1, which occurs for suﬃciently small g away from f = 0.

17

is made very large by 1/C, but not inﬁnite. Therefore unless it is strictly true that C = 0,
the loci f = 0 and g = 0 (i.e. Cη = 3h2 and {h = 0}∪{Cη = 2h2}) have J = 0 and J = 1,
and therefore gs = 2/√3 and gs = 1, respectively. In the limit of C becoming very small
but non-zero one expects the string coupling to become lower in the vicinity of f = 0 and

g = 0, though O(1) on the loci.

Let us see this explicitly. First, solving quadratic theory for τ near h = 0 (a component

of g = 0) we obtain

(3.52)
where B = 5 Γ( 7
12 ) ≃ .68542. As C becomes large, the gs associated with one of these
8√3 Γ( 13
solutions for a small h becomes weaker, but gs = 1 at h = 0 if C is ﬁnite. Studying the
other component of g = 0 where Cη = 2h2 is more diﬃcult because the locus itself moves

τ± = i ± B (Cη)−1/2 h + O(h2)

12 )Γ( 11
12 )
12 )Γ( 17

as C is taken to 0. This component intersects a disc centered at h = 0 at h = ±pCη/2,
and solving the quadratic theory near h =pCη/2 we have

τ± = i ± i 4√2B  h −r Cη

2 ! + O
"h −r Cη


2 #2
 .

(3.53)

In the strict limit C = 0 all of these loci collapse to h = 0 and the theory is weakly coupled,
but any C 6= 0 gives gs = 1 on the two components of g = 0. Similarly, the locus f = 0
gives rise to gs = 2/√3 point at the loci h = ±q Cη
in an h-disc, and this could be studied

3
explicitly using the theory where J is cubic in x2.

What is going on physically for these components? We have three: one for f = 0 and
two for g = 0, and unless gs = 0 they are strongly coupled loci. Examining the discriminant
we see that as C becomes small two seven-branes approach the locus h = 0 and collide in
the limit. This is the O7-plane, and therefore for C 6= 0 the region h = 0 is the strongly
coupled region between the two seven-branes that become the O7 in the Sen limit. The

h-disc is useful for studying f = 0 and the other component of g = 0. The picture is

(3.54)

where the hollowed circles are the only places where ∆ intersects the h-disc. These are the

two (p, q) seven-branes that become the O7 in the Sen limit, and in this limit the whole

pictures collapse to the central blue dot at h = 0. The red (blue) dots are where the f = 0
(g = 0) locus intersects the h-disc, and they have gs = 2/√3 and gs = 1, respectively. They
are strongly coupled regions that are separated from the branes for ﬁnite C.

The one caveat that we have not yet discussed involves conﬁgurations with constant

coupling. They were studied in the K3 case by Dasgupta and Mukhi [27], with the result

18

(which generalizes beyond K3) that seven-branes with ﬁber II, III, IV , I∗0 , IV ∗, III∗,
and II∗ may gave rise to constant coupling conﬁgurations. When this occurs, all but the
I∗0 case gives rise to constant coupling conﬁgurations with O(1) gs. In the I∗0 case there
are a continuum of possible gs values that may be constant cross the base B. In such a
case there may be multiple I∗0 seven-branes and the Weierstrass model takes the form

z2
i ,

f = FYi

z3
i ,

g = GYi

(3.55)

with F and G necessarily constants, rather than non-trivial sections of a line bundle. In
such a case they do not deﬁne vanishing loci in B with O(1) gs. Instead, all of the factors
of zi drop out of the J invariant,

J =

4F 3

4F 3 + 27G2

(3.56)

which is just a constant, not varying over the base. To our knowledge, this is the only
possible way to obtain an F-theory compatiﬁcation with non-zero gs ≪ 1 which is weakly
coupled everywhere in B.

In summary, aside from compactiﬁcations realizing this I∗0 caveat or the strict gs = 0
limit, there is a region f = 0 or g = 0 (or a component thereof) in every F-theory
compactiﬁcation with O(1) gs, and it is not necessarily near any seven-brane. This may
have interesting implications for moduli stabilization or cosmology in the landscape.

4. Non-Perturbative SU(3) and SU(2) Theories

4.1. Comparison to D7-brane Theories

In this section we would like to compare the non-perturbative realizations of SU(3) and
SU(2) theories from type IV and III ﬁbers to the SU(3) and SU(2) theories3 that may
be realized by stacks of three and two D7-branes at weak string coupling. The latter
are realized by type I3 and I2 ﬁbers, and in some cases (but not if the IV or III is
non-Higgsable) they are related by deformation.

Such deformations are slightly unusual.

In many cases a deformation of a geometry

spontaneously breaks the theory on the seven-brane, but in these cases the deformation

3The type IV and I3 ﬁbers realize SU (2) (SU (3)) theories in six and four-dimensional models if the ﬁber

is non-split (split).

19

leaves the gauge group intact4. However, the deformation is non-trivial, since the Kodaira
ﬁber, the number of branes in the stack, the SL(2, Z) monodromy, and the axiodilaton

proﬁle all change due to the deformation.

We begin by considering the relationship between SU(2) theories realized on seven-

branes with type I2 and III Kodaira ﬁbers. We expand f and g as

f = f0 + f1z

g = g0 + g1z + g2z2,

(4.1)

where f0, g0, and g1 do not depend on z but f1 and g2 can contain terms that are both
constant in z and depend on z. To engineer an I2 singularity we move to a sublocus in
complex structure moduli where

f0 = −3a2

g0 = 2a3

f1 = b

g1 = −ab,

in which case

∆ = z2(cid:0)108a3g2 − 9a2b2(cid:1) + z3(4b3 − 54abg2) + O(z4).

(4.2)

(4.3)

Here a and b are global sections of line bundles a ∈ Γ(O(−2K)) and b ∈ Γ(O(−4K − Z))
where Z is the class of the divisor z = 0. Specifying in moduli such that a = 0, we see that
f0, g0, and g1 vanish identically, and the resulting ﬁbration has (ordf, ordg, ord∆) = (1, 2, 3);
thus in the limit a 7→ 0 the I2 ﬁber over z = 0 becomes type III.

In a generic disc D containing z = 0 where z is also the coordinate of the disc, a
is a constant since f0, g0, and g1 do not depend on z. We can study the geometry of
the elliptic surface over the disc that is naturally induced from restriction of the elliptic
ﬁbration. From the point of view of the elliptic surface, then, the a 7→ 0 limit is just a
limit in a constant complex number a (technically a|D, but we abuse notation). Then a = 0
realizes a type III ﬁber along z = 0, and a small deformation a 6= 0 reduces it to an I2
ﬁber; both geometrically give rise to SU(2) gauge theories on the seven-brane.

We would also like to consider a second deformation parameter ǫ, set b = g2 = 1 for
simplicity, and consider a small enough disc that we can drop higher order terms in z; then

the two-parameter family of elliptic ﬁbrations over D is given by

g = ǫ + 2a3 − az + z2
∆ = 108a3z2 + 108a3ǫ − 9a2z2 − 54az3 − 54azǫ + 27z4 + 4z3 + 54z2ǫ + 27ǫ2.

f = −3a2 + z

4This is always true for a III to I2 deformation, and is also true for a IV to I3 deformation provided the

deformation preserve the split or non-split property related to non-simply laced groups.

We note the behavior of the discriminant in the relevant limits:

ǫ = a = 0 : ∆ = z3 (27z + 4) ,

(4.6)

where the ǫ = 0 limit is the limit of SU(2) gauge enhancement with a type I2 ﬁber, and
the ǫ = a = 0 limit maintains the SU(2) group but realizes the theory instead with a type

III ﬁber.

Analysis of the Two Deformations

Let us study two diﬀerent deformations of the type III theory that uncover its diﬀer-
ences from the I2 theory, and also the relationship between the two via deformation. The
ﬁrst deformation is to take ǫ 6= 0 but small; speciﬁcally, ǫ = .001. This is a small breaking
of the type III SU(2) theory, where the deformation causes the three branes comprising

the type III theory to split into three (p, q) seven-branes in a smooth geometry with no

non-abelian gauge symmetry. For these parameters the geometry appears in Figure 1 where

we have displayed the branes in the z-plane as red dots and we have also displayed the

x-plane above z = 0, where the blue dots represent three ramiﬁcaton points of the torus

described as a double cover (as is natural in a Weierstrass model). Any straight line be-

tween two of the blue dots determines a one-cycle in the elliptic ﬁber above z = 0, and by

following straight line paths from z = 0 to the seven-branes two of the ramiﬁcation points

will collide, determining a vanishing cycle.

Obtaining a consistent picture of the W-boson degrees of freedom throughout the moduli

space requires that the geometry provides a mechanism that turns the massive W-bosons

of the slightly deformed type III theory to the massive W-bosons of the slightly deformed

21

type I2 theory. From the weak coupling limit, we know that the latter are represented
by fundamental open strings. From the deformation of the type III singularity performed
in [5] we know that the former are three-pronged string junctions. Thus, for ǫ 6= 0 small,
the continual increase of a from 0 must turn string junctions into fundamental strings.

For the deformation of a type III singularity the vanishing cycles were derived in [5];

they can be read oﬀ by taking straight line paths from the origin. Beginning with the

left-most brane and working clockwise about z = 0, the ordered set of vanishing cycles are
ZIII = {π2, π1, π3} where these cycles are deﬁned as

x

π2

π1

π3

(4.7)

and the massive W-bosons of the broken theory are three-pronged string junctions J± =
(±1,±1,±1) which, topologically, are two spheres in the elliptic surface due to having
asymptotic charge zero [6]. Pictorially, they appear as

(4.8)

where the black dots represent seven-branes. See [5] for more details of the intersection

theory of these particular junctions, as well as their reproduction of the Dynkin diagram.

The ﬁrst deformation should be thought of as a small deformation of an SU(2) seven-

brane theory associated with a type III singularity, that is, a Higgsing. We would now like

to study a deformation that corresponds to a large deformation from a type III SU(2)
theory to a type I2 SU(2) theory (which does not Higgs the theory), and then a small
deformation that Higgses the SU(2) theory on the seven-brane with an I2 singular ﬁber.
Heuristically, the third brane of the type III singularity should be far away relative to the
distance between the two branes of the deformed type I2 singularity, which in type IIB
language are two D7-branes with a small splitting.

We take a = .3i and ǫ = .001. The diﬀerence between this deformation and the

deformation of the previous paragraph is that in this case one of the three seven-branes
that was originally at z = 0 is much further away due to taking a 6= 0, and the question is
whether the (p, q) labels of the three-branes changed in the process. The geometry appears

in Figure 2 where the brane on the left is the one that has been moved further away from

22

Fig. 2: Two ﬁgures of the geometry deformed by ǫ = .001, a = .3i, with (p, q) seven-branes

on the left and ramiﬁcation points of the elliptic curve on the right.

the origin by turning on a. If one were to maintain this value of a but tune ǫ 7→ 0, the two
branes close to the origin would collide to give an SU(2) theory with an I2 singular ﬁber.
Indeed, with this deformation the two-branes closer to the origin both have vanishing cycle
π1 and the brane displaced by the a deformation has vanishing cycle π3, so that now the
ordered set of vanishing cycles (beginning with the left-most brane and working clockwise
about z = 0) is Z = {π3, π1, π1}. The W-bosons of the broken I2 SU(2) theory are the
strings between the π1 branes, as expected since I2 is the F-theory lift of two D7-branes.
What has happened? The natural W-boson of the broken type III SU(2) theory (asso-

ciated to the a = 0, ǫ = .001 deformation) is the three-pronged string junction, but tuning a
from a = 0 to a = .3i the natural W-boson of the broken type I2 theory is the fundamental
string. The change between the two diﬀerent descriptions of the W-boson is a deforma-

tion induced Hanany-Witten move; for related ideas in a diﬀerent geometry, see [28]. This

can actually be seen via continuous deformation from a = 0 to a = .3i, during which

the leftmost (bottom) seven-brane in Figure 1 becomes the bottom (leftmost) seven-brane

of Figure 2.

In the process the straight line path from z = 0 to the (moving) leftmost

seven-brane in Figure 1 is crossed via the movement of the bottom seven-brane in Figure

1, changing the (p, q) labels of the former. This matches the changes in the ordered sets

of vanishing cycles.

Though we have explicitly seen the natural state change using a deformation, let us

check the possibilities using the usual algebraic description of Zwiebach and Dewolfe [29]

where the (p, q) seven-branes are arranged in a line with branch cuts pointing downward.

Technically, the branch cuts represent the mentioned straight line paths from the origin,
the latter being the point whose associated ﬁber E0 appears in the relative homology

23

H2(Xd, E0) that deﬁnes the string junctions. Xd is the elliptic surface of the disc. The
W-boson of the broken SU(2) theory associated to a type III singularity is

π1

π3

π2

where for concreteness we choose a basis such that π1 = (1, 0), π2 = (0, 1) and π3 = (−1,−1)
with the convention that we cross branch cuts by moving to the right. Then the monodromy

matrix associated to a (p, q) seven-brane is

 1 − pq
−q2

p2

1 + pq!

(4.9)

and one can check that the monodromy of these three branes reproduces the monodromy

of the type III singularity, as they must after deformation. We see

Mπ2Mπ3Mπ1 = MIII =  0
−1

1

0! ,

(4.10)

which is the expected behavior.

In this description, the continuous motion of the seven-branes described above amounts
to the π3 brane crossing the branch cut of the π2 brane, changing its vanishing cycle to

M−1

π3  0

1! = −1

0 ! seven-brane; but this is just −π1 and we are free to call it a π1 seven-

brane instead if we reverse the sign of any junction coming out of the brane. With this

movement and relabeling, the above junction becomes

π1

π1

π3

and now the branes are in a position to do the relevant Hanany-Witten move. Prior to

crossing the branch cut from the right, the (p, q) charge of the piece of string that ends on
the middle brane (in this picture) is π1 + π3, and after the branch cut it is π1 due to the
monodromy action M−1
π3 . If the monodromy action is replaced by a prong by pulling the

24

string through the brane (that is, performing a Hanany-Witten move), how many extra

prongs k are picked up on the right-most brane? Charge conservation requires

π1 + π3 + k π3 = π1

(4.11)

and we see k = −1. That is, the Hanany-Witten move replaces the portion of the string
crossing the branch cut with a prong going into the π3 brane. This cancels against the
prong that is already there, leaving

π1

π1

π3

which, since we have chosen π1 = (1, 0), is just a fundamental string. If we had chosen π1
to be some other (p, q) value this would be a (p, q) string, but there is always a choice of

SL(2, Z) frame what would turn it back into a fundamental string.

In summary, we see using algebraic techniques that the natural W-boson of the Hig-

gsed type III SU(2) theory, which is a three-pronged string junction, is related to the
the natural W-boson of the Higgsed type I2 SU(2) theory. The relationship is a brane
rearrangement together with a Hanany-Witten move, which we have seen explicitly above

via two deformations of the elliptic surface with a type III singular ﬁber.

The natural W-bosons of the type I3 theory are (in an appropriate SL(2, Z) duality
frame) fundamental strings and the natural W-bosons of the type IV theory include string

junctions (see e.g.

[5] for an explicit analysis). Via deformation they must be related

to one another, and given the result we have just seen it is natural to expect a brane

rearrangement and a Hanany-Witten move. This expectation is correct, though we will not

explicitly show it since the techniques are so similar to the previous case.

We would like to present the deformation for the interested reader, though. Take

f = −3a4 + ab z + c z2 + f3 z3

g = 2a6 − a3b z +(cid:18) b2

12 − a2c(cid:19) z2 + g3z3

(4.12)

where a, b, and c are global section a ∈ O(−K), b ∈ O(−3K − Z) and c ∈ O(−4K − Z)
with Z is the class of z = 0. Here f3 and g3 contain constant terms in z as well as higher
order terms. The discriminant is

z4(cid:0)−1152a5bf3 − 144a4c2 − 864a3bg3 + 120a2b2c + 3b4(cid:1) + O(z5)

(4.13)

25

and we see that there is a gauge theory with I3 ﬁber on the seven-brane at z = 0. In the
a = 0 limit we see that

f = z2 (c + f3z)

g =

1
12
3 z4 + 64f 3

z2(cid:0)b2 + 12g3z(cid:1)

∆ =

1
16

z4(cid:0)3b4 + 72b2g3z + 64c3z2 + 192c2f3z3 + 192cf 2

which has a gauge theory with type IV Kodaira ﬁber on the seven-brane at z = 0.

In

these cases we have not imposed the absence of outer monodromy (i.e. we have no imposed

a split ﬁber), so they are SU(2) gauge theories. If the form is further restricted so that

outer monodromy is imposed, it is an SU(3) gauge theory.

5. Extra Branes at Seven-Brane Intersections

Two seven-branes that intersect along a codimension two locus C ⊂ B are typically only
seven-branes that intersect along C. However, a counterexample giving rise to SU(3) ×
SU(2) gauge symmetry was studied in [9] where an additional brane with an I1 singular
ﬁber also intersected the curve of SU(3) × SU(2) intersection. Though one might have
expected a IV -III collision, a IV -III-I1 collision occurs automatically. The Weierstrass
model is f = z1t2 F and g = z2t2 G with

∆ = z3t4 (4t2F 3 + 27zG2) =: z3t4 ˜∆,

from which it can be seen that the brane along ˜∆ = 0 intersects {z = t = 0} =: C. Three
stacks of branes intersect C, and we call ˜∆ = 0 the “extra brane” at C.

There is a natural guess regarding the associated physics: where there is an extra

brane there should be extra string (or string junction) states. In the mentioned example

it was found that such a collision gives rise not only to the expected bifundamentals of
SU(3)× SU(2), but also [9] fundamental hypermultiplets of SU(3) and SU(2) which could
come in chiral multiplets if ﬂux is turned on. Such conﬁgurations may be non-Higgsable;

for example geometries, see [9, 15, 16].

Under which circumstances is there necessarily an extra brane? We take F1 and F2 to

be the Kodaira singular ﬁbers of seven-branes that collide along C, with

F1,2 ∈ {II, III, IV, I∗0 , IV ∗, III∗, II∗}.

(5.1)

These are the possible ﬁbers of non-Higgsable seven-branes. Let J1 and J2 be the J-
invariants associated with F1 and F2. By direct calculation we ﬁnd:

Table 3: The possible intersecting elliptic seven-branes that may arise, according to their
singular ﬁbers F1 and F2, and some of their properties.

• If either F1 or F2 is I∗0 there is no additional brane.

• If neither F1 nor F2 are I∗0 then there is an additional brane if and only if J1 6= J2.
• If there is an additional brane then precisely one of the ﬁbers is type III∗ or III.

• If there is an additional brane and the Weierstrass model does not have (f, g) vanish-
ing to order ≥ (4, 6) along C, then the ﬁber types are either (IV, III) or (III, II).
To see this, let the seven-brane with ﬁbers F1 and F2 be localized on the divisors z = 0
and t = 0 respectively. Then write

f = zatb F

g = zctd G

(5.2)

where a, b, c, d can be determined from Table 1 given the knowledge of F1 and F2. The
discriminant takes the form

∆ = zmin(3a,2c) tmin(3b,2d) ˜∆

(5.3)
and there is an extra brane along C whenever ˜∆|z=t=0 = 0. In the cases where there are
no (4, 6) curves, the above conclusions can all be seen directly from Table 3, where “NF ”
denotes that the J invariant of I∗0 is not ﬁxed.

5.1. Associated Matter Representations

There are two possible ﬁber intersections that force the existence of an extra brane, IV -III

and III-II. Due to the eﬀects of outer monodromy, the IV -III collision allows for the
possibility of intersecting non-abelian seven-branes with SU(3) × SU(2) or SU(2) × SU(2)
gauge symmetry, while intersecting seven-branes with a ﬁber collision IV -III necessarily
have SU(2) gauge symmetry. The Lie algebra representations of matter at the IV -III-I1
SU(3) × SU(2) collision was determined in [9]. They are hypermultiplets of

(3, 2), (3, 1), (1, 2)

(5.4)

in the absence of ﬂux, but can become the chiral non-abelian SU(3)×SU(2) representations
of the standard model if chirality inducing G-ﬂux is turned on.

Let us determine the Lie algebra representations in the case of the other collision,
which is III-II-I1 via anomaly cancellation in six dimensions. Consider a six-dimensional
F-theory compactiﬁcation with B2 = P2 and a seven-brane with SU(2) gauge symmetry
from a type III ﬁber on Z = {z = 0}, a divisor in the hyperplane class. Take also a
seven-brane with no gauge symmetry and a type II singular ﬁber on T = {t = 0}, also in
the hyperplane class. Such a Weierstrass model takes the form

f12 = z t f10

g18 = z2 t g15

∆ = z3t2 (4f 3

10 t + 27g2

15 z) ≡ z3 ˜∆

and we would like to study matter at the intersection z = ˜∆ = 0. These intersections are of
two types: the single point z = t = 0 and the 10 points z = f10 = 0 with t 6= 0. The latter
are all points where seven-branes with a type III and I1 ﬁber collide; there are 2 funda-
mentals of SU(2) for each such point [30]. Thus, the 10 points contribute 20 fundamental

hypermultiplets. Since anomaly cancellation for an SU(2) seven-brane on the hyperplane in
P2 requires 22 hypermultiplets (see e.g. section 2.5 of [31]), anomaly cancellation requires
that the III-II-I1 intersection also contribute two fundamental hypermultiplets.

6. Argyres-Douglas Theories on D3-branes and BPS Dyons as Junctions

D3-branes in the vicinity of seven-branes realize non-trivial N = 2 quantum ﬁeld theories
on their worldvolume [32], which are broken to N = 1 theories by the background. The po-
sition of the D3-brane relative to a seven-brane determines a point on the Coulomb branch

of the D3-brane theory, and the seven-brane determines a singular point on the Coulomb

branch at which additional particle states become massless. This point is reached when the

28

D3-brane collides with the seven-brane, and the additional light states are string junctions

that stretch from the seven-brane to the D3-brane. Previous works [33, 34] determined the
string junction representations of BPS particles for well-known N = 2 theories, including
Nf = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 Seiberg-Witten theory [35].

In this section we will do the same for D3-branes probing the type II, III, and IV

singularities. Recall that the latter two are associated with the non-perturbative SU(2) and

SU(3) theories on seven-branes that were discussed in section 4. Relative to weakly coupled
realizations of SU(2) and SU(3) from 2 D7-branes and 3 D7-branes, which have an I2 and
I3 ﬁber in F-theory, the type III and IV theories have an extra seven-brane. Via studying
local axiodilaton proﬁles we have seen that in the vicinity of the brane the string coupling

is O(1) and that these seven-branes source a nilpotent SL(2, Z) monodromy. Therefore,
the worldvolume theories of nearby D3-branes necessarily diﬀer from the Nf = 2, 3 Seiberg-
Witten theories realized on D3-branes near I2 and I3 seven-branes.

The worldvolume theory on a D3-brane when it has collided with a type III or type
IV seven-brane is the Nf = 2 or 3 Seiberg-Witten theory at its Argyres-Douglas point,
respectively. We will see that the characteristic [36] Argyres-Douglas (AD) phenomenon is

realized by string junctions. This phenomenon is existence of points in the moduli space
where electrons and dyons charged under the U(1) of the N = 2 theory simultaneously
become massless. In F-theory this occurs when the D3-brane collides with a type III or

type IV seven-brane. The AD phenomenon was originally realized in G = SU(3) theories,

which have genus two Seiberg-Witten curves, and thus one might expect it to not exist

in an elliptically ﬁbered setup such as F-theory. For specially tuned G = SU(2) Seiberg-

Witten theories Argyres-Douglas points do exist [37], though; the tuning brings in an extra
singularity that turns a type I2 (I3) ﬁber into a type III (IV ) ﬁber. Somewhat ironically,
F-theory models with non-Higgsable seven-branes of type III and IV do not require any

such tuning; the topology of the base B forces the local structure of the Seiberg-Witten
curve that would appear tuned from an N = 2 point of view.

We will use the BPS junction criterion5 of [34] to determine the BPS states on three-

branes near the type II, III, and IV seven-branes. This constraint is

(J, J) ≥ −2 + gcd(a(J))

(6.1)

where J is the string junction and a(J) is its asymptotic charge, and it is derived from the

requirement that in the M-theory picture J is a holomorphic curve with boundary, with

the boundary a non-trivial one-cycle a(J) in the smooth elliptic curve above the D3-brane.

5See [33] for another study of BPS junctions.

29

This one-cycle a(J) is the asymptotic charge, and it determines the electric and magnetic

charge of the associated junction under the U(1) of the D3-brane theory. Junctions are

relative homology cycles [6], i.e. two-cycles that may have boundary in a smooth elliptic

curve above a particular point p. This point is given physical meaning if p is the location

of a D3-brane.

Throughout this section we will need a basis choice in order to represent the one-cycle

a(J) as a vector in Z2. We choose

π1 = 1
0! ,

π3 = 0
1! ,

(6.2)

which determines π2 via π1 + π2 + π3 = 0 ∈ H1(Ep, Z), where Ep is the elliptic ﬁber above
the D3-brane in the F-theory picture, or alternatively the torus that deﬁnes the electric

and magnetic charges.

6.1. The Nf = 1 Argyres-Douglas Point and the Type II Kodaira Fiber

Let us study the F-theory realization of BPS states on a D3-brane near a slightly deformed
type II Kodaira ﬁber. From [5], the vanishing cycles are Z = {π3, π1} and so the I-matrix
that determines topological intersections is

I = (·,·) = −1 − 1

cycle, and the associated BPS particle arises from wrapping an M2-brane on that cycle;

30

the anti-particle associated to −J arises from wrapping an anti M2-brane. Note that there
is no junction J with a(J) = 0 and (J, J) = −2; as explained in [5], this demonstrates via
deformation that the type II singularity does not carry a gauge algebra.

One might be tempted to think that the seven-brane associated to a type II singularity

has little impact on the low energy physics of an F-theory compactiﬁcation, since it does

not carry any gauge algebra. However, this is not true, and we would like to emphasize:

• Locally near the type II seven-brane (or precisely in the 8d theory) the worldvolume
theory on the D3-brane is Nf = 1 Seiberg-Witten theory near its Argyres-Douglas
point. At that point BPS electrons, monopoles, and dyons become massless.

• Since J = 0 for the type II Kodaira ﬁber, gs is O(1) in the vicinity of the seven-brane,

with τ proﬁle solved via Ramanujan’s alternative bases in section 3..

• Even though both can split into two mutually non-local seven-branes, the seven-

brane associated to a type II Kodaira ﬁber is not an orientifold. First, because their

SL(2, Z) monodromies are diﬀerent, and second because the orientifold famously must

split due to instanton eﬀects in F-theory, which is not true of the type II seven-brane.

6.2. The Nf = 2 Argyres-Douglas Point and the Type III Kodaira Fiber

In this section we study the F-theory realization of BPS states on D3-branes near a slightly

deformed type III Kodaira ﬁber. In the coincident limit this theory is the Argyres-Douglas
theory obtained by tuning Nf = 2 G = SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory to its Argyres-Douglas
point. Utilizing an explicit deformation of [5], the vanishing cycles are Z = {π2, π1, π3} and
the I-matrix that determines topological intersections is

Thees BPS particles arising from string junctions also have BPS anti-particles via the action

Using the constraint (6.1) the possible BPS string junctions can be computed directly.
The states of self-intersection −2 have a(J) = 0 and were identiﬁed in [5]. They are
J+ = (1, 1, 1) and J− = (−1,−1,−1), where the ± denote a choice of positive and negative
root for the associated SU(2) algebra that is the gauge algebra on the seven-brane and

the ﬂavor algebra of the three-brane theory. The rest of the junctions satisfying (6.1) have

theory with masses turned on; see e.g. [38].

We have seen the relationship between the ordered sets of vanishing cycles Z = {π2, π1, π3}
of [5] and6 Z = {A, A, C} of [29, 34] that can be associated to the deformed type III Ko-
daira ﬁber by explicit deformation in section 4. Let us study the BPS states with the latter

There are junctions J± satisfying the BPS constraint (6.1) with a(J) = 0 and (J, J) = −2.
They are J+ = (1,−1, 0) and J− = (−1, 1, 0), and they are the W± bosons of the broken
SU(2) theory. The rest of the junctions satisfying the BPS condition have (J, J) = −1 and
satisfy

We again see two SU(2) doublets and two SU(2) singlets before taking into account the
−J junctions. These junctions with electromagnetic charge must be related to those of
Z = {π2, π1, π3} by a Hanany-Witten move, as we explicitly showed for the simple roots
J± in section 4.

6.3. The Nf = 3 Argyres-Douglas Point and the Type IV Kodaira Fiber

In this section we study the F-theory realization of BPS states on D3-branes near a slightly

deformed type IV Kodaira ﬁber. In the coincident limit the worldvolume theory on the D3-
brane is the Argyres-Douglas theory obtained by tuning Nf = 3 G = SU(2) Seiberg-Witten
theory to its Argyres-Douglas point.

The ordered set of vanishing cycles derived in [5] is ZIV = {π1, π3, π1, π3} and the

associated I-matrix that determines the topological intersections of junctions is

I = (·,·) =

.

(6.11)

These BPS particles arising from string junctions also have BPS anti-particles via the action
J 7→ −J, which preserves (J, J) and a(J) and therefore the associated junctions −J satisfy
(6.1). The latter arise from wrapped anti M2-branes in the M-theory picture.

Let us derive the possible BPS string junctions using the constraint (6.1). The junctions
of self-intersection −2 have a(J) = 0 and were identiﬁed in [5]. They are the roots of an
SU(3) algebra, and we take J1 = (1, 0,−1, 0) and J2 = (0, 1, 0,−1) as the simple roots;
then the full set of root junctions is simply J1,J2, J1 + J2 and their negatives. Solving the
condition for BPS junctions (6.1) we ﬁnd that the possible BPS junctions are

and we have chosen the ordering of the junctions in the ﬁrst three columns to show that

they are fundamentals of SU(3). Namely, in each of the ﬁrst thee columns the second
junction subtracted from the ﬁrst is J1 and the third junction from the second is J2. The
negatives of these are anti-fundamental, completing the non-trivial ﬂavor hypermultiplets.
