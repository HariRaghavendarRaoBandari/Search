Bragg coherent x-ray diffractive imaging is a powerful technique for investigating dynamic nanoscale pro-
cesses in nanoparticles immersed in reactive, realistic environments. Its temporal resolution is limited, however,
by the oversampling requirements of 3D phase retrieval. Here we show that incorporating the entire measure-
ment time series, which is typically a continuous physical process, into phase retrieval allows the oversampling
requirement at each time step to be reduced leading to a subsequent improvement in the temporal resolution by
a factor of 2-20 times. The increased time resolution will allow imaging of faster dynamics and of radiation-
dose-sensitive samples. This approach, which we call “chrono CDI,” may ﬁnd use in improving time resolution
in other imaging techniques.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding nanoscale processes is key to improving
the performance of advanced technologies, such as batter-
ies, catalysts, and fuel cells. However, many processes oc-
cur inside devices at short length and time scales in reactive
environments and represent a signiﬁcant imaging challenge.
Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) has emerged as
a powerful technique for revealing 3D nanoscale structural
information.1,2 With current BCDI methods, 3D image re-
constructions of nanoscale crystals have been used to iden-
tify and track dislocations,3,4 image cathode lattice strain
during battery operation,5,6 indicate the presence of surface
adsorbates,7,8 and reveal twin domains.9,10 The temporal res-
olution of current BCDI experiments, however, is limited by
the oversampling requirements for current phase retrieval al-
gorithms. The insight developed in this work is that, for most
physical processes, structural evolution is a continuous pro-
cess that introduces structural redundancy when measured as
a time series. Here, we exploit this redundancy to allow for
reduced oversampling (less than the conventionally required
factor of 2), thereby improving the measurement rate. In prin-
ciple, this method can also be used to increase the spatial res-
olution.

Our new approach, which we call “chrono CDI,” improves
the temporal resolution of BCDI by reducing the oversam-
pling requirement along one dimension (qz) at a given time
step without signiﬁcantly compromising image ﬁdelity. To
enable this capability, we designed a reconstruction algorithm
that simultaneously reconstructs all time states in a series of
Bragg rocking curves by utilizing constraints from neighbor-
ing time steps. In this work, the initial and ﬁnal states are as-
sumed to be known in real space. In practice, this situation is
achieved provided both states are measured with the required
oversampling (OS). The time frame over which the sample
is assumed to be static (the measurement time of an individ-
ual rocking curve) is reduced in chrono CDI, providing access
to faster dynamics in 3D crystals. In addition, this approach
can be used to limit the radiation dose in radiation-sensitive
samples and/or increase the spatial resolution by allowing for
reduced sampling in qx and qy.

Figure 1a shows a schematic of a Bragg rocking curve.
The rocking curve entails rotating the sample with respect

tal: (a) Schematic of a Bragg rocking curve. The rocking curve
involves rotating the sample with respect to the incident x-rays ki.
Here, kf represents the scattered x-rays, q the particular scatter-
ing vector, and Ghkl the particular Bragg peak. The rocking curve
sweeps the 2D area detector through the 3D volume in the qz direc-
tion. Conventionally, all 2D measurements shown by black boxes
are required; in order to improve the time resolution, only some 2D
measurements (red stars) could be taken. Dt denotes the full 3D
diffraction measurement and ∆ the time required to make the full
measurement. (b) Select time states from the time sequence that was

schematically by θstart and θend, displaces the scattering vector

Bragg reﬂection condition for the HKL lattice planes, so that
the 3D intensity distribution (yellow isosurface) can be appro-
priately sampled and the structure of the nanocrystal (green
cube) can be reconstructed. The series of 2D measurements

ing curve measurements. The total time for the measurement
is ∆. Current phase retrieval algorithms require an oversam-
pling of at least 2 of the diffraction pattern in all three dimen-
sions. We refer to an oversampling of 2 as the required over-
sampling. In addition, the nanocrystal must be approximately
static over the measurement time ∆ while Dt is collected,
which limits the dynamic timescale that can be observed.11,12
Figure 1b shows three select time states from a time se-
ries during which a single crystal palladium nanocube (85 nm
side length) is exposed to hydrogen gas. Experimental de-
tails are given in a recent publication.13 The absolute value of
the image (shown as an isosurface) corresponds to the Bragg-
diffracting electron density,9 while the phase, φ, of the image
(color projected onto the isosurface) is proportional to a com-
ponent of the vector displacement ﬁeld u via φ = u · Q.1,14,15
In this case, the Pd (111) Bragg peak was measured and
φ ∼ u111. In the Pd nanocube, hydrogen intercalation ini-
tially causes displacement ﬁeld changes (t = 42 minutes) be-
fore morphological changes occur (t = 76 minutes) due to
the hydriding phase transformation.16,17 The time evolution of
the nanocube structure shown in Fig. 1b was determined from
BCDI experiments performed with an oversampling of 3 in qz
at Sector 34-ID-C of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne
National Laboratory (see Experimental Details in Supplemen-
tal Material and Ulvestad, et al.13). Each complete measure-
ment took approximately 2 minutes (∆ in Fig. 1).

II. ALGORITHMIC APPROACH

To incorporate the redundancy in correlated time series
such as those in Fig. 1, we modify conventional BCDI phase
retrieval algorithms. The function minimized by the error re-
duction phase retrieval algorithms is the modulus error, ε2
M,
which measures the agreement between the reconstruction’s
Fourier moduli and the measured moduli,

where ρ is the 3D reconstructed object (in real space), D is the
3D far-ﬁeld intensity measurement, q is the reciprocal-space
coordinate, ˜ρ = F [ρ], and F is the Fourier transform. Differ-
ent choices of the function to be minimized lead to different
phase retrieval algorithms.18 In chrono CDI, we include a term
that depends on reconstructions at other time states,

In this expression, t indexes the time states, w(t, t(cid:48)) is the
weight, t (cid:54)= t(cid:48), and µ(ρt, ρt(cid:48)) is the miscorrelation term. In
this paper, we consider nearest-neighbor correlations in time,
a scalar weight parameter w ≥ 0, and a functional form for

Although other forms are possible, this form has the advan-

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To evaluate the algorithm’s performance, we carry out it-
erative phase retrieval on noise-free, simulated data as well
as on measured experimental data with different amounts of
oversampling.

A. Simulated Data with Required Oversampling

t

In this case, the simulated data Dsim

is generated by 3D
Fourier transforms of each complex valued Pd nanocube re-
construction in the time series after zero padding to meet the
oversampling (OS) requirements of phase retrieval.20 We re-
fer to an oversampling of 2 as the required oversampling (Req.
O.S.). In practice, this means the cube size was half of the ar-
ray size in all three dimensions. The time sequence considered
consists of t = 0, 12, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, and 76 min-
utes. This time sequence is approximately equally spaced and,
as shown in Fig. 2, has varying amounts of nearest-neighbor
correlation, with an average nearest-neighbor correlation co-
efﬁcient of 61%. The correlation coefﬁcient c(t, t(cid:48)) ∈ [−1, 1]
is deﬁned between two 3D displacement ﬁelds at time states t

and t(cid:48) by(cid:80)

where u111 is the displacement ﬁeld projection and ¯u111 is the
average displacement ﬁeld over the particle.

Figure 3a shows the correlation coefﬁcient matrix for the
chosen time sequence. Figure 2 is a plot of the super-diagonal
matrix values. The chosen time sequence is a good balance
between having smooth evolution between nearest neighbors
and having a large change over the whole time sequence (both
the displacement and the amplitude change signiﬁcantly). The
ﬁrst numerical test of chrono CDI reconstructs the sequence ρt
from the sequence of Dsim

t with the required oversampling.

The algorithm uses with random initial starts and alternates
between the error reduction (ER) and the hybrid input-output
(HIO) algorithms using a feedback parameter of β = 0.7;21

the support is ﬁxed to the size of the object and is not evolved
during the iterative process. At iteration numbers N = 100n,
for n = 1, 2, . . . , 18, the algorithm tests whether all recon-
structions are correctly oriented with respect to the known
initial (t = 0 minutes) and ﬁnal (t = 76 minutes) states
by testing whether they are conjugated and reﬂected (“twin”)
solutions.21 Although reconstructing the “twin” image does
not affect ε2
M, it will negatively impact µ, resulting in an artiﬁ-
cially high total objective. One constraint used in the present
work is that the ρt of the initial and ﬁnal states are known
in real and diffraction space. This constraint can be achieved
by measuring diffraction datasets at the required oversampling
before the experimental dynamics start and after no signiﬁcant
changes are seen in the diffraction data.

M(ρt, Dsim

Figure 3b shows the errors ε2

) and µ(ρt, ρt(cid:48)), av-
eraged over all reconstructed time states and over 10 random
starts, as a function of the scalar weight w. Both errors are
normalized by the total intensity in the image. Figure ?? in the
Supplemental Material shows the modulus error ε2
M as a func-
tion of iteration number for two scalar weight values. The
initial and ﬁnal states (t = 0 and t = 76 minutes, respec-
tively) are known in real space. When w = 0, the modulus
error is the lowest, and the miscorrelation term is the largest.
These results are expected because the data is noise-free and
oversampled at the required oversampling such that a unique
solution is fully determined for each Dsim
. The weight w = 0
corresponds to the case when no correlations are taken into ac-
count. As w increases, µ(ρt, ρt(cid:48)) decreases, and ε2
M increases
for the solution set {ρt} because their relative contributions to
the total objective change. With data sampled at the required
oversampling, including information from neighboring time
steps in a time series will not improve each individual recon-
struction because the complete 3D structural description of
the sample at each time is uniquely encoded in the 3D coher-
ent intensity pattern.

at a given time step by reconstructing the time series Dsim
dis-
cussed previously but with different degrees of reduced sam-
pling in qz. To start, every third 2D diffraction measurement
of the original 84 2D diffraction measurements was selected
to form Dsim
for all times except the initial and ﬁnal time.
This leads to data that has 1/3 of the required oversampling.
If such a time series were measured experimentally, the mea-
surement time would be reduced by a factor of 3. In assessing
algorithm performance, the modulus error was calculated by
comparing the far-ﬁeld exit wave of the reconstructions with
the data sampled at the required oversampling. As before, the
initial and ﬁnal states are known, the support is known, and
alternating ER/HIO is used as described previously.

We now explore how the additional redundancy from the
time series can compensate for reduced oversampling during
the rocking curve (e.g. oversampling at less than a factor of 2)

Figure 4a shows the average (over all time states and ran-
dom starts) modulus error as a function of the scalar weight
w for varying amounts of oversampling. The average normal-

of w = 0.01. This modulus error is computed with respect
to the datasets that are sampled at the required oversampling,
and thus the reconstructions at these minima are the “best” so-
lutions. When only 1/84 (red) of the required oversampling is
used (i.e., a single slice from the rocking curve), the modulus
error decreases with increasing w and approaches a constant
value, which is near the normalized average modulus error
when all the reconstructed time states are set to the average of
the initial and ﬁnal state (black dashed horizontal line). In this
case, simply using an average of the initial and ﬁnal states out-
performs the reconstruction algorithm, indicating that there
are insufﬁcient reciprocal space constraints and that the over-
sampling in qz is too low.

On average w = 0.01 improves the reconstructed time
sequence relative to w = 0, which takes no time correla-
tion into account, for up to 1/20 of the required oversam-
pling. However, it is not clear from the plot of the average
whether all time states are being improved equally. Figure 4b
shows the normalized modulus error at each time state for
w = 0, 0.01, 0.5 at 1/3 of the required oversampling for a
particular random start. The states nearest to the known states
(t = 0 and t = 76 minutes) have lower modulus errors, as ex-
pected. By comparing w = 0 with w = 0.01, we see that the
improvement occurs in all the intermediate states except the
state at t = 66 minutes, which remains essentially unchanged.
These results demonstrate that the algorithm improves all re-
constructions, even those least correlated with their neigh-
bors (see Fig. 2 for a plot of the nearest neighbor correla-
tion). The beneﬁts of chrono CDI are clear when the required
oversampling is reduced by up to a factor of approximately
1/20. In these cases, enforcing a degree of nearest-time-step,
real-space correlation provides an additional constraint that
improves the reconstruction at all intermediate times relative
to what can be achieved using conventional phase retrieval.

C. Experimental Data

We now demonstrate chrono CDI on experimental rock-
ing curve data. To simulate varying degrees of reduced over-
sampling, a subset of the original 2D measurements was se-
lected from the experimental datasets. Figure 5 shows exam-
ple 2D experimental diffraction measurements from the Pd
(111) Bragg rocking curve; see Ulvestad, et al.13 for more de-
tails. An oversampling of approximately 3 in qz was used dur-
ing the original measurement. The reconstruction algorithm is
the same as described previously except that the support is not
known a priori. Instead, an initial box half the array size in
each dimension is used, and the support is updated with the
shrinkwrap algorithm14,22 using a Gaussian function with a
threshold of 0.01 and standard deviation of 1.

Figure 6 shows chrono CDI reconstructions for two rep-
resentative time states of experimental diffraction data from
Pd nanocubes undergoing structural transformations when ex-
posed to hydrogen gas. As before, different amounts of over-
sampling were investigated. The isosurfaces shown corre-
spond to the reconstructed Bragg electron density, while the
color map corresponds to the image phase φ, which is pro-

the same average normalized modulus error values as w = 10−4.
The modulus error reported here is computed with respect to the data
with the required oversampling. Error bars represent the standard de-
viation of the different average (over all time states) values obtained
from 10 different random starts. Error bar for w = 0.01 and 1/20th

pled at 1/3 (blue) and 1/20 (black) of the required oversam-
pling, a minimum in the modulus error is observed at a value

the same conclusion holds for t = 42 minutes. See Figure ??
in the Supplemental Material for central cross-sections that
show the amplitude and phase distributions inside the crystal.
The average normalized modulus error of the time sequence is
improved from 0.2 to 0.1 by including nearest-neighbor infor-
mation (via w = 0.01). Although the reconstructions do not
match exactly, the results convey the same overall physical
changes in the crystal.

Figure 7 shows that when 3/10 of the required oversam-
pling is used (corresponding to every 5th slice of the original
data), major differences in both the reconstructed Bragg elec-
tron density and displacement ﬁelds arise as compared with
the full-rocking-curve reconstructions. There are also dis-
agreements in the reconstructed phases (proportional to the
displacements). We therefore conclude that chrono CDI ap-
plied to this particular set of measurement data for the chosen
time sequence could have decreased the measurement time by
a factor of 2 without losing the essential physics of the trans-
forming crystal. For simulated data it could have reduced the
time by up to a factor of 20. The discrepancy is likely due
to the ﬁnite extent in reciprocal space of the real data, noise

pling of 2. The reconstruction for w = 0.01 is much improved
compared with w = 0 and is similar in morphology and lat-

IV. DISCUSSION

In this work, we have shown that our new algorithm im-
proves the time resolution of BCDI by a factor of 2 for experi-
mental data and 20 for simulated data. The algorithm thereby
enables BCDI investigations of dynamic structural processes
in crystals that were previously out of reach and limiting radi-
ation dose in sensitive samples. The time resolution improve-
ments we demonstrate are achieved by reducing the number
of 2D measurements made during a 3D Bragg rocking curve,
leading to datasets with less than the required oversampling in
qz at each intermediate time step. The rocking curves across
the entire time series are reconstructed simultaneously, en-
forcing a degree of real-space correlation between solutions
at neighboring time steps to account for the reduced over-
sampling of each individual measurement. The algorithm and
its variations should be useful for improving the time reso-
