We study the ﬁnite time singularity correspondence between the Jordan and Einstein frames for
various F (R) gravity theories. Particularly we investigate the ordinary pure F (R) gravity case and
the unimodular F (R) gravity cases, in the absence of any matter ﬂuids.
In the ordinary F (R)
gravity cases, by using speciﬁc illustrative examples, we show that it is possible to have various
correspondences of ﬁnite time singularities, and in some cases it is possible a singular cosmology
in one frame might be non-singular in the other frame. In the unimodular F (R) gravity case, the
unimodular constraint is aﬀected from the conformal transformation, so this has an eﬀect on the
metric we choose. Moreover, we study the Einstein frame counterpart theory of the unimodular
F (R) gravity case, and we investigate the correspondences of the singularities in the two theories by
considering speciﬁc illustrative examples. Finally, a brief dynamical system analysis is performed
for the vacuum unimodular F (R) gravity and we demonstrate how the dynamical system behaves
near the future Big Rip singularity.

INTRODUCTION

Cosmological singularities are timelike singularities in contrast to spacelike singularities, which occur in the case of
compact astrophysical objects, like black holes [1]. The ﬁnite time cosmological singularities aﬀect the whole three
dimensional spacelike hypersurface deﬁned by the time instance that these occur, and these were concretely classiﬁed
for the ﬁrst time in [2]. In the classiﬁcation scheme of Ref. [2], there are four diﬀerent singularity types, among which
the Big Rip [3] is the most severe from a phenomenological point of view, since all the physical quantities which are
deﬁned on the spacelike hypersurface deﬁned by the singularity, severely diverge. On the antipode of the Big Rip
singularity lies the so-called Type IV singularity [2, 4–7], which is a soft singularity, since all the physical quantities
are ﬁnite at the time instance that the singularity occurs, but the higher derivatives of the Hubble rate diverge. From
a ﬁrst glance, the Type IV singularity seems not to aﬀect the cosmological system, since the singularity does not alter
the physics of the three dimensional hypersurfaces, however the occurrence of the Type IV singularity, crucially aﬀects
the dynamical evolution of the cosmological system, as was explicitly demonstrated in [5, 6], and in some cases this
might have interesting consequences. Particularly, it is possible that the existence of a Type IV singularity triggers a
graceful exit from inﬂation, due to a dynamical instability caused by the Type IV singularity, see [6] for details. In
addition, in some cases, a Type IV singularity can be constrained by physical processes, for example in Ref. [7] it was
shown that the gravitational baryogenesis can constrain the form of the Type IV singularity.

In the literature there exists a class of singularities, known as sudden singularities, which were ﬁrstly studied in
Ref. [8], and later developed in Refs. [9, 10]. The Type IV singularity belongs to this class of singularities, and the
possibility of having singular inﬂation with sudden singularities was studied in Ref.
[11]. A particular interesting
feature of milder singularities is that geodesics incompleteness does not occur for milder singularities, in contrast with
the Big Rip case, where geodesics incompleteness occurs, hence in the case of mild singularities, a smooth passage of
the Universe through them is guaranteed.

The ﬁnite time cosmological singularities can be consistently described by F (R) modiﬁed gravity models [12],
since the theoretical framework of modiﬁed gravity oﬀers many possibilities for realization of cosmological scenarios
which are exotic for standard Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail the
correspondence of the ﬁnite time singularities between the Einstein and Jordan frames, in the context of various F (R)
gravity frameworks. For a recent work using scalar-tensor theories, see [13]. It is a well known fact that every Jordan
frame F (R) gravity has an Einstein frame counterpart, related to each other by a conformal transformation [12], so
the basic issue we will address with this paper is how the ﬁnite time cosmological singularities are transformed from
one frame to the other. As we will demonstrate, it is possible that the mild singularities in one frame correspond
to crushing type singularities in the other frame, under the conformal transformation. Of course, it is expected that
the F (R) gravity framework plays some crucial role in the study, so we shall investigate the Jordan-Einstein frame
correspondence in various F (R) gravity variants. Speciﬁcally, we shall use the recently developed unimodular F (R)
gravity [14, 15] and also the usual vacuum F (R) framework. For simplicity we focus on the case that the F (R) gravity
is described by a power law function of the Ricci scalar, of the form R−n, but in principle the study can be extended
in other cases too. After providing some essential information about ﬁnite time singularities and the essential features
of the conformal transformation relating the Jordan and Einstein frames of F (R) gravity, we investigate how certain
singularities behave under the conformal transformation. We also discuss how speciﬁc cosmological evolutions are
transformed under this transformation. In addition, we discuss the same issues in the context of unimodular F (R)
framework. By using several illustrative examples, we demonstrate that there exist several patterns of transformations
from frame to frame, depending also to the form of the F (R) gravity. Also, in the case of the unimodular F (R) gravity,
we develop the necessary formalism that relates the Jordan and Einstein frames. Note that it is known that even in
the case of no singularities, there is no physical equivalence of Jordan and Einstein frames, see for example [16, 17].
In section II, we present some fundamental information about ﬁnite time
singularities and we study in detail the F (R) gravity case. After demonstrating in brief how to obtain the Einstein
frame counterpart, we investigate how the cosmological singularities behave under the conformal transformation, for
the case that the F (R) gravity is of the power law type R−n. In section III, we brieﬂy present the unimodular F (R)
gravity framework and also the corresponding Einstein frame counterpart of this theory. We also give an account
on the unimodular theory of a canonical scalar ﬁeld, and we use some illustrative examples in order to demonstrate
explicitly how the singularities are transformed from frame to frame. In section IV we present in brief the phase
structure of the dynamical system corresponding to the vacuum unimodular F (R) gravity and we discuss certain
features of the dynamical system near the Big Rip singularity. Finally, the concluding remarks follow in the end of
the paper.

This paper is organized as follows:

The geometric background we shall assume in this paper is described by a ﬂat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)

metric, with line element,

ds2 = −dt2 + a(t)2 Xi=1,2,3(cid:0)dxi(cid:1)2

,

(1)

with a(t) denoting as usual the scale factor. In addition, the connection is assumed to be the Levi-Civita connection,
which is a torsion-less, symmetric, and metric compatible aﬃne connection. Physical quantities in the Einstein frame
will be denoted with a tilde˜, whereas quantities in the Jordan frame will not.

II. F (R) GRAVITY

Before we get into the core of our study, it is worth recalling at this point some essential information with regards to
the ﬁnite time cosmological singularities. The detailed classiﬁcation of these was ﬁrstly done in Ref. [2], and according
to which classiﬁcation, there are four types of ﬁnite time singularities. The classiﬁcation criteria of Ref. [2], were the
scale factor, the energy density, the pressure density and the higher derivatives of the Hubble rate. Depending on
the behavior of these physical quantities on the spacelike three dimensional hypersurface corresponding to the time
instance that the singularity occurs, the classiﬁcation goes as follows,

• Type I (“the Big Rip Singularity”) : This is the most severe type of ﬁnite time cosmological singularities, being
a singularity of the crushing type. This happens when, as the cosmic time approaches a certain time t → ts,

3

the eﬀective energy density, the scale factor and the eﬀective pressure all diverge, so that a → ∞, ρeﬀ → ∞,
and |peﬀ| → ∞ when t → ts. For more details about the Big Rip Singularity, we refer to the following set of
important papers. [2, 3]

• Type II (the “Sudden Singularity”) [10]: This type of singularity appears when, as the cosmic time t → ts,
the scale factor a and the eﬀective energy density ρeﬀ remain bounded, that is a → as, ρeﬀ → ρs, where both
as, ρs < ∞, but the eﬀective pressure peﬀ diverges. This means |peﬀ| → ∞ as t → ts. This can occur when the
second derivatives of the scale factor diverge.

• Type III: This type of singularity is more severe than the Type II singularity, and appears when, as the cosmic
time t → ts, the scale factor a remains bounded, that is a → as, but this time both the eﬀective energy density
and the eﬀective pressure diverge, meaning ρeﬀ → ∞ and |peﬀ| → ∞. This can happen when the ﬁrst and
second derivatives of the scale factor diverge.

• Type IV : This is the least severe of the types of cosmological singularities studied here. This type of singularity
appears when, as the cosmic time t → ts, the scale factor, the eﬀective energy density and the corresponding
eﬀective pressure all remain bounded, a → as, ρeﬀ → ρs and |peﬀ| → ps , but the second or higher derivatives
of the Hubble rate diverge. For more on this type of singularity, we refer the reader to the following [2, 4–7].

Having this classiﬁcation scheme in mind, let us proceed to description of the F (R) gravity in the Jordan frame and
we investigate how these singularities are transformed to each other with a conformal transformation.

The vacuum F (R) gravity action in the Jordan frame is,

If we vary this action with respect to the metric and assume a ﬂat FRW metric, we ﬁnd the following ﬁeld equations
in the absence of matter

S =

1

2κ2 Z d4x√−gF (R) .

where primes and dots denote derivation with respect to the Ricci scalar R and the cosmic time t respectively.

We now conformally transform in order to obtain the scalar-tensor Einstein frame counterpart theory. In order to
do this, we introduce the auxiliary ﬁelds A and B, so that we can write the equivalent action of the action (2), which
reads,

S =

1

2κ2 Z d4x√−g {B(R − A) + F (A)} .

(5)

Varying this action with respect to the auxiliary scalar B, results in the condition A = R, and hence we recover the
action (2). We can eliminate the auxiliary ﬁeld B from this action by varying with respect to A, and in eﬀect we end
up to the condition B = F ′(A), so the action takes the equivalent form,

S =

1

2κ2 Z d4x√−g {F ′(A)(R − A) + F (A)} .

(6)

By conformally transforming the metric, we can obtain a minimally coupled scalar-tensor theory, which is called the
Einstein frame scalar-tensor theory. We use a particular conformal factor of the form,

which modiﬁes the Ricci scalar as R → ˆR. After performing this conformal transformation, and upon deﬁning a new
scalar ﬁeld σ in terms of the auxiliary scalar ﬁeld A,

ˆgµν =

1

F ′(A)

gµν ,

(7)

the action (6) takes the following form,

σ = − ln F ′(A),

S =

2κ2 Z d4xp−ˆg(cid:26) ˆR −

2

ˆgµν∂µϕ∂ν ϕ − V (ϕ)(cid:27) ,

(9)

with the potential V (σ) being equal to,

V (σ) =

A

F ′(A) −

F (A)
F ′(A)2 .

4

(10)

Note that the potential (10) can be easily rewritten in terms of the scalar ﬁeld σ, by inverting the relation (8). Hence
the resulting Einstein frame scalar-tensor theory corresponding to the Jordan frame F (R) gravity (2) is given by the
action of Eq. (9). Finally we can rescale the scalar ﬁeld σ to put it into the canonical form by introducing

ϕ =r 3
2κ2 σ.

Conversely, by starting with the following scalar-tensor canonical scalar ﬁeld action,

S =Z d4xp−ˆg( ˆR

2κ2 −

1
2

ˆ∂µϕ ˆ∂µϕ − V (ϕ)) ,

(11)

(12)

we can transform it to a Jordan frame F (R) gravity theory. By assuming a ﬂat FRW metric, the Friedman equations
corresponding to the action (12) are equal to,

3 ˜H 2 =
3 ˜H 2 + 2 ˙˜H = −

1
2

2

˙φ2 + V ,

˙φ2 + V .

(13)

(14)

Now let us map to a modiﬁed gravity F (R) theory. This means we must perform the conformal transformation

gµν → e±√ 2

3 κφˆgµν , so that the FRW metric (1) becomes,

F (R) = e±√ 2
ds2

−d˜t2 + ˜a(˜t)2 Xi=1,2,3(cid:0)dxi(cid:1)2
3 κφ
 ,

(15)

and in order to obtain a FRW metric in the F (R) gravity frame, we introduce a new time coordinate ˜t variable, given
by solving the following equation,

dt = e± 1

3 κφd˜t ,

2√ 2

(16)

the solution of which, t = f (˜t), is an increasing function. Certain problems occur if the function f (˜t) contains
singularities. The range of the values of the cosmic time ˜t might get mapped to a diﬀerent range in the t coordinate.
Assume that the range of the values of the cosmic time ˜t is the interval [˜t1, ˜t2], with the scale factor at ˜t = ˜t1 being
equal to, ˜a(˜t1) = 0 and at ˜t = ˜t2, the scale factor being equal to, ˜a(˜t2) = 0 or ˜a(˜t2) = ∞. The latter situation at
˜t = ˜t2, corresponds to a Big Crunch and to a Big Rip respectively, in which case with potentially ˜t1 = −∞ and/or
˜t2 = ∞, so that these singularities eﬀectively do not occur, a fact which crucially depends on the particular form of
the scale factor at hand. The new range of t variable will be [f (˜t1), f (˜t2)], assuming φ(˜t) is regular everywhere over
the range [˜t1, ˜t2]. The scale factor in terms of the t-variable is determined by the following equation,

a(t(˜t)) = e± 1

3 κφ˜a(˜t) ,

2√ 2

which upon diﬀerentiation with respect to ˜t, it yields,

da(t(˜t))

˜a(˜t) + ˙˜a(˜t) .

(17)

(18)

Therefore, in the Jordan frame, the scale factor a is an increasing function if and only if the following condition holds
true,

in the original frame, and decreasing if the opposite inequality holds true.

˜H > ∓r 2

A. Power Law Cosmology

5

In order to demonstrate the correspondence of ﬁnite time singularities between the Einstein and Jordan frames,
we shall use some simple but illustrative examples. In the following we will work in units such that the gravitational
coupling constant κ = 1. We start oﬀ with the power law cosmology, described by the following scale factor,

˜a(˜t) = ˜a0(˜t/˜t0)p ,

(20)

with ˜t0 being some ﬁducial time and p a positive real free parameter. Such a power law scale factor is a solution to
the Friedmann equations in the Einstein frame scalar-tensor theory when the potential is of the exponential form. In
such a case the scalar ﬁeld behaves as,

In this case ˜t1 = 0 and ˜t2 = ∞ and in this model the Hubble rate ˜H diverges at ˜t = 0, so we have a Type III
singularity in the Einstein frame.
By using the standard procedure outlined above, we can apply a conformal transformation to convert the theory

φ = ±p2p ln(˜t/˜t0) .

(21)

to the Jordan frame. The new time coordinate t can be found by solving the following diﬀerential equation,

which has the following solution,

= (˜t/˜t0)±√ p

3 ,

dt
d˜t

t =

3

3 ± √3p

˜t0(cid:19)±2√ p
˜t(cid:18) ˜t

3

.

The corresponding scale factor as a function of the cosmic time reads,

√3p±3p
√3p±3 .

a(t) ∼ t

(22)

(23)

(24)

In the case where the minus sign is chosen in the conformal factor, the cosmological evolution (24) has a Type I ﬁnite
time singularity at t = 0 if the power law parameter p lies in the range 1/3 ≤ p < 3. If p = 1/3, the Jordan frame
metric becomes static and there is no longer a singularity. In all other cases, the Type III singularity at ˜t = 0 in the
original Einstein frame remains a type III singularity at t = 0 in the Jordan frame.

B. Cosmology Generated by R−n Gravity in the Jordan Frame

We consider now the cosmology corresponding to an R−n gravity in the Jordan frame, which was studied in detail
in [17]. When F (R) behaves as F (R) ∼ R−n, it can be seen from (3) and (4) that the corresponding scale factor
behaves as the following power law type,

Therefore, if either n < −2 or −1 < n < −1/2, a Big Rip Type I singularity appears at the time instance t = t0 in
the Jordan frame, and in the remaining cases a Type III Big Crunch singularity is present at this point. In this case,
the corresponding Einstein frame canonical scalar ﬁeld reads,

a ∼ (t0 − t)

(n+1)(2n+1)

n+2

.

(25)

where we took into account that the Ricci scalar reads,

σ ∼ (n + 1) ln R ∼ −2(n + 1) ln(t0 − t) ,

In the corresponding scalar-tensor theory, the time coordinate ˜t is given by,

R ∼

6(n + 1)(2n + 1)(4n + 5)n

(n + 2)2(t0 − t)2

.

d˜t = ±e

1

2 σdt ∼ ±(t0 − t)−(n+1)dt ,

(26)

(27)

(28)

and consequently, we have ˜t = ±(t0 − t)−n. Therefore, in the case that n > 0, when t approaches t → t0 in the
Jordan frame, this corresponds to ˜t → ±∞ in the Einstein frame. As a consequence, the singularity changes its
structure, since it does not appear in ﬁnite time for the scalar-tensor theory, however a new additional singularity
may be present, as when t approaches inﬁnity in the Einstein frame, it corresponds to the new time coordinate ˜t → 0,
and thus any singularities at inﬁnity can be brought towards a ﬁnite time. On the other hand, when n < 0, the
limit t → t0 in the Jordan frame corresponds to ˜t → 0 in the Einstein frame. We also ﬁnd that the metric in the
scalar-tensor theory behaves as

ST = eσ

˜a(˜t)2 ∼ a2

(29)

−dt2 + a(t)2 Xi=1,2,3

 ∼ −d˜t2 + ˜a(˜t)2 Xi=1,2,3

(dxi)2

where the constant a0 is an arbitrary parameter. In this case the power of the scale factor is negative only when
−2 < n < −1 or 0 < n < 1, and thus a Big Rip Type I singularity becomes present then. Thus for the Big Rip Type
I singularity in the Jordan frame, the scale factor now behaves as ˜a(˜t)2 → 0 when ˜t → 0, in the Einstein frame it
becomes a Type III Big Crunch singularity.

C. A Singular Cosmological Evolution

In this section we investigate how the simplest singular cosmology, behaves in the corresponding frame. The simplest

singular cosmology is described by the following Hubble rate,

with f0 an arbitrary real and positive parameter and α a real number, the values of which will determine the singularity
Type. Particularly, depending on the values of the parameter α, we have the following singularities in the cosmological
evolution,

H(˜t) = f0(˜t − ˜ts)α ,

(30)

• When α < −1, the cosmology develops a Type I singularity.
• When −1 < α < 0, the cosmology develops a Type III singularity.
• When 0 < α < 1, the cosmology develops a Type II singularity.
• When α > 1, the cosmology develops a Type IV singularity.

Assume that the cosmological evolution (30), occurs in the Einstein frame, and the question is what happens if we
3 φ and therefore the metric transforms

convert to the Jordan frame F (R) theory? The conformal factor is given by e√ 2

as follows,

F (R) = e√ 2
ds2

−d˜t2 + ˜a(˜t)2 Xi=1,2,3(cid:0)dxi(cid:1)2
3 φ
 ,

consequently, the scale factor becomes,

where the Jordan frame time parameter t is deﬁned implicitly through the following relation,

a(t) = e

2√ 2

1

3 φ˜a(˜t) ,

2√ 2

1

3 φd˜t .

dt = e

(31)

(32)

(33)

The solution to this diﬀerential equation is an incomplete gamma function. Now if the Hubble rate H is described by
Eq. (30), then from the corresponding equations of motion, the Einstein frame scalar ﬁeld is equal to,

2√−2f0α(˜t − ˜ts)

α + 1

α+1

2

,

φ =

(34)

where f0α < 0 is required in order for the scalar ﬁeld to be canonical. The transformation blows up at ˜ts if α < −1,
so extra caution is required in this case. In eﬀect, the new Hubble rate in terms of our initial time coordinate ˜t is
equal to,

H(˜t) =

√−f0α(˜t − ˜ts)

√3

α−1

2

+ f0(˜t − ˜ts)α ,

(35)

7

and the question is what is the eﬀect on the time coordinate t. Suppose that, t = f (˜t). When, f (˜t) 6= 0, we have,

and correspondingly, the following relations holds true,

f′(˜t) = e

d ˜H

2√ 2

3 φ d ˜H
d˜t

This means that the expression dH
d˜t diverges for α > −1, as then the conformal factor is
ﬁnite at ˜ts. Eﬀectively, a Type I singularity occurs when the Hubble rate H(t) diverges and the question is whether
the singularity still appears at a ﬁnite time, we need to investigate whether f (˜ts) is ﬁnite. It is easy to show that,

dt diverges if and only if d ˜H

ts = f (˜ts) = c1 − c2Γ(cid:18) 2

α + 1(cid:19) ,

(38)

which is ﬁnite, provided 2
1+α is not a negative integer. Consequently, the singularity appears in the Hubble rate H
at a ﬁnite time, as long as α 6= 2/n − 1 where n ≥ 2 is an integer. Accordingly, a Type II singularity occurs if dH
dt
diverges, but H does not diverge. Combined together, these imply that 1 < α < 3. Note that for α > 3 a Type IV
singularity occurs. Now we investigate how the scale factor behaves when it is conformally transformed, which in the
Einstein frame reads,

so the conformally transformed scale factor in the Jordan frame reads,

˜a(˜t) = Ce

f0 (˜t−˜ts )1+α


 ,

(39)

(40)

with β an arbitrary constant. The scale factor (40) dictates the following singularity patter for the cosmological
evolution, depending on the values of the parameter α,

• For α < −1, a Type I or no singularity occurs.
• For −1 < α < 1, a Type III singularity occurs.
• For 1 < α < 3, a Type II singularity occurs.
• For 3 < α, a Type IV singularity occurs.

In Table I we have presented the singularity correspondence for the Jordan and Einstein frame. As we can see, the
most interesting cases are the Type I, Type II and Type IV singularities, since the case of the Big Rip singularity in
the Einstein frame may correspond to a non-singular evolution in the Jordan frame. Also the Type II singularity can
be modiﬁed to a more severe Type III singularity in the Jordan frame, and the Type IV in the Einstein frame can
correspond to a Type II singularity in the Jordan frame.

A special case of the singular evolution (30) is the singular bounce cosmology which is a special case of the symmetric

bounce [14]. We can rewrite the scale factor of the cosmological evolution (30), in the following form,

in which case, the Hubble rate reads,

a(t) = ef0(t−ts)2(1+ǫ)

,

H(t) = 2(1 + ǫ)f0(t − ts)2ǫ+1

where ǫ > 0 and has to be carefully chosen so that everything remains real. Particularly, in order for a bounce to
occur, for t < ts the Hubble rate must become negative, that is H < 0 and also in order for the bounce (41) to be a
deformation of the symmetric bounce a(t) ∼ eβt2
, the parameter ǫ must be chosen in the interval 0 < ǫ < 1 and also

must be of the following form,

ǫ =

2n

2m + 1

,

(43)

where m and n are integers chosen in such a way so that ǫ < 1. Clearly, for this choice of ǫ, the cosmology described
by the scale factor (41) and the Hubble rate (42) clearly describes a Type IV singular cosmology, in which case, the
Hubble rate and its ﬁrst derivative ˙H are ﬁnite, but the second derivative with respect to the cosmic time ¨H diverges.
As was demonstrated in [6], by using well known reconstruction techniques [12], the pure F (R) gravity which can
realize the cosmological evolution (42) is approximately given by,

F (R) = R +

R2
4C0

+ Λ ,

(44)

where C0 is positive, near the bouncing point, which is t ≃ ts. For simplicity we introduce the parameter x = t − ts,
so the limit near the bouncing point corresponds to the limit x → 0. In order to transform the theory in the Einstein
frame, we perform the following conformal transformation,

where the scalar ﬁeld σ is equal to,

gµν = e−σ ˆgµν ,

σ = ln F ′(A) .

In terms of the parameter x, the Ricci scalar is given by,

and so if we are close to the singularity, in which case x is small, the Ricci scalar becomes,

R = 12f0(ǫ + 1)x2ǫ(cid:0)4f0(ǫ + 1)x2ǫ+2 + 2ǫ + 1(cid:1)

Consequently, by combining Eqs. (44) and (48), we obtain,

R ≈ 12f0(ǫ + 1)(2ǫ + 1)x2ǫ .

F ′(R) ≈ 1 +

where C2 is another positive constant. This means that the new time coordinate of the Einstein frame FRW metric

Owing to the fact that, dt = dx at x ≃ 0, by looking at the second derivative of the scale factor a(t) it easily follows
that it diverges at x = 0 provided ǫ < 1/2. Thus the Type IV singularity in the Jordan frame becomes a Type II
singularity in the Einstein frame, which is expected according to Table I.

III. UNIMODULAR F (R) GRAVITY

9

Apart from the standard F (R) gravity approach, which we developed in the previous sections, we shall study the
correspondence between frames in the context of unimodular F (R) gravity, with the latter being developed in Refs.
[14, 15]. The general action of unimodular F (R) gravity reads [14],

S =Z d4x(cid:8)√−g (F (R) − λ) + λ(cid:9) + Smatter ,

with F (R) being a smooth function of the Ricci scalar, λ is the Lagrange multiplier function and Smatter stands for
the action of the matter ﬂuids present. If we do a variation with respect to λ, we obtain the unimodular constraint,

√−g = 1 ,

(54)

so that the determinant of the metric is ﬁxed. The unimodular constraint is the central point of unimodular F (R)
gravity.
If we vary the action (53) with respect to the metric tensor gµν, we obtain the unimodular F (R) ﬁeld
equations given by,

gµν (F (R) − λ) − Rµν F ′(R) + ∇µ∇νF ′(R) − gµν∇2F ′(R) +

1
2

Tµν = 0.

(55)

In order to study cosmology, one needs to be very careful since the ﬂat standard FRW metric of Eq. (1) does not
satisfy the unimodular constraint (54). However, upon making the following coordinate transformation,

the resulting metric satisﬁes the unimodular condition (54). Using the transformation (56), we obtain,

dτ = a(t)3dt,

(60)

(61)

ds2 = a (t (τ ))−6 dτ 2 − a (t (τ ))2(cid:16)dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:17) .

which we will call for brevity, the unimodular FRW metric. Using this metric, the vacuum ﬁeld equations become

.

By using the unimodular FRW metric of Eq. (57), the corresponding Ricci scalar reads,

R = a6(6 ˙K + 30K 2).

In the following sections we shall study the correspondence of the Jordan frame unimodular F (R) gravity in the
Einstein frame.

A. Scalar-tensor Einstein Frame Representation

Having presented the unimodular F (R) gravity in the Jordan frame, we now study the corresponding scalar-tensor
theory. We start oﬀ with the action of Eq. (53), omitting the matter ﬂuids, and we introduce the auxiliary ﬁeld A,
as we did in the ordinary F (R) gravity case, so that the action becomes,

S =Z d4x(cid:0)√−g (F ′(A)(R − A) + F (A) − λ) + λ(cid:1) .

(62)

Note that the last term of the action will be unaﬀected by conformal transformations. In order to obtain a minimally
coupled scalar-tensor theory, we perform the same conformal transformation we performed in the standard F (R)
gravity case, which is,

ˆgµν = eσgµν ,

(63)

where ˆg denotes the metric in the Einstein frame, and g the metric in the Jordan frame. Also, the scalar ﬁeld σ in
terms of A is given by, σ = − ln F ′(A), so the action (62) becomes,

10

S =Z d4x(cid:26)p−ˆg(cid:18) ˆR −

3
2

ˆgµν∂µσ∂ν σ − V (σ) − λe−2σ(cid:19) + λ(cid:27) ,

(64)

which describes a canonical scalar ﬁeld action, in the absence of any matter ﬂuids. Note however that the unimodular
constraint is not unaﬀected by the conformal transformation, to in the case at hand it becomes,

p−ˆg = e2σ .

(65)

In eﬀect, the FRW metric of Eq. (1) does not satisfy this constraint identically, so in the same way we evades this
issue previously, we introduce a new time coordinate τ , which is related to the cosmic time t as follows,

d˜τ = ˜a(˜t)3e2σ(˜t)d˜t ,

(66)

so that the conformally transformed unimodular constraint of Eq. (65) is satisﬁed. The corresponding Einstein frame
unimodular FRW metric becomes,

ds2 = −

e4σ(˜τ )
˜a(˜τ )6 d˜τ 2 + ˜a(˜τ )2

dx2
i .

3

Xi=1

(67)

To transform between the two frames at the level of the metric then, the following transformation happens. The

scale factor transforms as

where the parameter ˜τ is related to τ as follows,

˜a(˜τ ) = eσ/2a(τ ) ,

e4σ(˜τ )
˜a(˜τ )6 d˜τ 2 =

eσ
a(τ )6 dτ 2 .

(68)

(69)

By combining Eqs. (68) and (69), we can easily see that the new time coordinate ˜τ is the same as the coordinate τ ,
that is, ˜τ = τ .

B. Jordan frame of Canonical Scalar Field Model

Up to now we have discussed the unimodular F (R) gravity case, but we also need to discuss what is the scalar-tensor

unimodular gravity. Let us start with the following minimally coupled scalar-tensor action,

S =Z d4x(p−ˆg  ˆR

2κ2 −

1
2

ˆgµν ∂µφ∂ν φ − V (φ) − λh(φ)! + λ) ,

(70)

where for now we have assumed that the determinant of the metric is given by an arbitrary function of the scalar
ﬁeld. This will be determined later by the requirement that the action has a Jordan frame. The ﬂat unimodular
FRW equations for this action are given by the standard scalar ﬁeld cosmological equations with a modiﬁed scalar
potential of the form V (φ) + λh(φ). Explicitly, we have

1
2

3 ˜K 2 =
9 ˜K 2 + 2 ˙˜K = −

˙φ2 +(cid:16)V (φ) + λh(φ)(cid:17)˜a(˜τ )−6 ,
˙φ2 +(cid:16)V (φ) + λh(φ)(cid:17)˜a(˜τ )−6 .

1
2

(71)

(72)

Here ˜K(˜τ ) represents the unimodular Hubble parameter in the Einstein frame, explicitly given by

˜K(˜τ ) = ˜K(τ ) =

1

d˜a(τ )

˜a(τ )

dτ

.

11

(73)

Now let us attempt to conformally transform this action to a Jordan frame. We apply the following conformal

transformation,

This rescaling eliminates the kinetic term from the action, reducing it to the following form,

gµν = e±κ√ 2

3 φˆgµν .

S =Z d4xn√−g(cid:16)e±κ√ 2

3 φ2κ2R − e±2κ√ 2

3 φ(V (φ) + λh(φ))(cid:17) + λo .

(74)

(75)

Varying this action with respect to the scalar ﬁeld φ, which is now just an auxiliary ﬁeld, gives the following equations
of motion,

R = e±κ√ 2

3 φ 4κ2(V (φ) + λh(φ)) ± 2κr 2

3

(V ′(φ) + λh′(φ))! .

(76)

To ﬁnd the Jordan frame unimodular F (R) gravity, we need to invert this equation to ﬁnd the scalar ﬁeld φ(R), as a
function of R only, and so independent of λ. This determines the up to now arbitrary function h(φ), which must be
chosen as follows,

h(φ) = e−2κ√ 3

2 φ .

In this case we can invert to ﬁnd φ = φ(R) as usual, so the resulting unimodular F (R) gravity theory reads,

where the F (R) gravity is,

S =Z d4x(cid:8)√−g (F (R) + λ) + λ(cid:9) ,

F (R) = e±κ√ 2

3 φ(R)2κ2R − e±2κ√ 2

3 φ(R)V (φ(R)).

(77)

(78)

(79)

Now that we have the corresponding Jordan and Einstein frames, in the following sections repeat the analysis
performed in the standard F (R) case and present some illustrative examples to see the correspondence of ﬁnite time
singularities in the two frames. Again, all quantities in the Einstein frame will be denoted with a tilde, and we will
set the gravitational coupling constant κ = 1.

C. Power law

Let us begin by examining how a power law scale factor transforms when one conformally maps from the Einstein
frame to the Jordan frame. Let us consider the following scale factor in terms of the time coordinate ˜τ from the
unimodular Einstein frame FRW metric (67)

˜τ0(cid:17)p
˜a(˜τ ) = a0(cid:16) ˜τ

.

(80)

Here ˜τ0 is some ﬁducial time and p is a positive parameter. Using this scale factor, the unimodular Hubble parameter is
˜K(τ ) = p˜τ−1. Therefore at ˜τ = 0, the Hubble rate diverges and hence this cosmology possesses a Type III singularity
in the Einstein frame. Such a scale factor is a solution to the Einstein frame Friedmann equations (71)-(72) when the
potential is of the exponential type. In this case the scalar ﬁeld takes the form

Using this solution, we can now change all our variables from the Einstein frame to the Jordan frame, using the

conformal transformation

gµν = e±κ√ 2

3 φˆgµν .

(82)

φ(˜τ ) = ±p2p(1 − 3p) log(˜τ /˜τ0) .

(81)

As we discussed in Sec. III A, the time coordinate τ in the Jordan frame is equivalent to the original time coordinate
in the Einstein frame. So using the transformation (82), we ﬁnd that the scale factor in the Jordan frame is given by

12

a(τ ) = e± 1

2√ 2

3 φ˜a(˜τ ) ∼ τ p±q p(1−3p)

3

.

(83)

When the minus sign is chosen for the conformal transformation, we see that there is a potential for the Type III
singularity to become a Big Rip Type I singularity. This can happen at τ = 0 if the power law parameter lies in the
range 0 < p < 1/6. For all other cases the Type III singularity remains a Type III singularity in the Jordan frame.

D. The case F (R) = R−n Singularity Types in the Jordan Frame

Now let us examine a model where we begin in the Jordan frame and conformally transform to the Einstein frame.
We consider vacuum unimodular F (R) gravity of the form F (R) ∼ R−n, in which case the scale factor behaves as
follows,

a(τ ) ∼ (τ0 − τ )

1+3n+2n2
5+10n+6n2 ,

(84)

where we used the τ coordinate of the unimodular FRW metric. It is obvious that a Big Rip singularity occurs in
the τ coordinate, if the parameter n lies in the range −1 < n < −1/2. In terms of the original FRW cosmic time
coordinate t, this means the scale factor evolves as,

Thus a Big Rip singularity in the τ coordinate, appears in the t coordinate if n < −2 or −1 < n < −1/2.
the conformal factor is given by

The question now is what happens in the corresponding Einstein frame scalar-tensor theory. The scalar ﬁeld σ of

a(t) ∼ t

(2n+1)(n+1)

2+n

.

(85)

σ ∼ (n + 1) ln R ∼ −(cid:18) 2(n + 1)(2 + n)

5 + 10n + 6n2 (cid:19) ln(τ0 − τ ),

where we use the fact that the Ricci scalar in the unimodular time parameter is given by

R ∼ (τ0 − τ )−2(cid:16)

2+n

5+10n+6n2 (cid:17).

This means under a conformal transformation, the scale factor transforms as follows

˜a(˜τ ) = eσ/2a(τ )

where the parameter ˜τ is the same as the original time coordinate τ , ˜τ = τ . Therefore we have,

˜a ∼ (τ0 − τ )

n2−1

6n2+10n+5 .

(86)

(87)

(88)

(89)

These conditions enlarge the range of values of n for which the power of the scale factor is negative, with now n lying
in the range −1 < n < 1 giving rise to this. Thus a Type I Big Rip will appear for more values of n.

E. A singular cosmological model

As a ﬁnal example, we will consider a toy model where the unimodular Hubble parameter in the Einstein frame is

where f0, α are real constants and ˜τs is some time. In this case, the corresponding scale factor is

˜K(˜τ ) = f0(˜τ − ˜τs)α ,

where a0 is a constant.

˜a(˜τ ) = a0e

f0(˜τ−˜τs )α+1

α+1

,

(90)

(91)

13

Now, in order to convert this Einstein frame solution to the Jordan frame, we need to ﬁnd the scalar ﬁeld φ giving
rise to such a solution (90). To do this we must solve the diﬀerential equation obtained by subtracting the unimodular
Friedmann equations (71) and (72). We ﬁnd

˙φ2 + 6f 2

0 (˜τ − ˜τs)2α + 2f0α(˜τ − ˜τs)α−1 = 0 .

(92)

This equation can not be integrated in general for an arbitrary power of α, and so in order to proceed we will
approximate the solution around the singularity at ˜τ = ˜τs. Doing this results in two separate cases: when α < −1
and the Hubble rate is that of a Type I singularity, and when α > −1 and the other singularity types are present.
In the case when α < −1 and then around the singularity, the second term of (92) dominates over the third term
and so, close to the singularity, we can approximate (92) to be

˙φ2 + 6f 2

0 (˜τ − ˜τs)2α ∼ 0 .

(93)

In this case, solving for φ, we ﬁnd that it becomes imaginary, and thus such a Hubble rate could only be described
by a phantom scalar ﬁeld. For such a phantom ﬁeld, the corresponding Jordan frame F (R) becomes complex, and so
we will not examine this case further.

However, now when α > −1, the third term in (92) will dominate over the second term and therefore in this case

the scalar ﬁeld near the cosmological singularity at ˜τ = ˜τs will behave as

2√−2f0α

α + 1

φ(˜τ ) ∼ ±

(˜τ − ˜τs)

α+1

2

,

(94)

which is real if −2f0α > 0. And so in this case we can proceed further and conformally transform to the Jordan
frame. Applying the conformal transformation (74) and using that the time coordinate is unchanged τ = ˜τ , we ﬁnd
the scale factor in the Jordan frame reads

3f0 (τ−τs )α+1±2√−3αf0 (τ−τs )

3(α+1)

α+1

2





 .

a(τ ) ∼ a0e

(95)

Now from this scale factor we can read oﬀ conditions for the diﬀerent singularity types to exist. We have the

following structure

• For −1 < α < 1, a Type III singularity occurs.
• For 1 < α < 3, a Type II singularity occurs.
• For 3 < α, a Type IV singularity occurs.

Table II shows a summary of how the diﬀerent singularities change type from one frame to another. The Type I
singularity is excluded from this table, since it only occurs when α < −1 and the scalar ﬁeld becomes a phantom. We
observe that the unimodular F (R) case behaves in a very similar way to the standard F (R) case. The most interesting
cases are the Type II and the Type IV singularities in the Einstein frame. The Type II singularity is modiﬁed to the
more severe Type III singularity, with the Hubble rate now diverging. There is also the potential for the Type IV
singularity to become a more severe Type II singularity if the parameter α lies in the range 1 < α < 3.

IV. PHASE STRUCTURE OF UNIMODULAR F (R) GRAVITY NEAR FINITE-TIME

SINGULARITIES-A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS

In this section we shall discuss in brief the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system corresponding to the
vacuum unimodular F (R) gravity near the ﬁnite time singularities. The focus will be exactly for cosmic times near

14

the ﬁnite time singularities, so we discuss in brief how the dynamical system behaves near the singularities. However,
a most thorough analysis of the dynamical system will be given elsewhere. We start oﬀ by introducing the following
variables,

x1 = −

1

dF ′(R)

KF ′(R)

dτ

,

x2 = −

F (R)

6K 2F ′(R)a6 ,

x3 =

R

6K 2a6 ,

x4 =

λ

6a6K 2F ′(R)

.

(96)

With this choice, the ﬁrst Friedmann equation reduces to,

Thus one can choose to analyze the dynamics of just three of these variables, since one can algebraically relate the
fourth to the others. From the second Friedmann equation, we ﬁnd that,

1 = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 .

(97)

Diﬀerentiating with respect to a cosmological time dN = K(τ )dτ we obtain the following dynamical system,

1

F ′(R)K 2

d2F ′(R)

dτ 2 = 1 + 5x1 + 3x2 + x3 + 3x4.

1 − x1x3 − 3x2 − x3 − 3x4

x′1 = −1 + x2
x′2 = −m + 4x2 + x1x2 − 2x2x3 + 50 − 16x3
x′3 = m + 20x3 − 2x2
x′4 = x4(x1 − 2x3 + 4)

3 − 50

(98)

(99)

where m = ¨K
K 3 . Note that the fourth of these equations is superﬂuous due to the relation (97), and one can use this
to replace x4 in the remaining three equations. Note that the dynamical system, due to the existence of the term m,
is non autonomous.

The critical points of the system have been displayed in Table III. The focus in this section is to investigate certain
cases, for which the dynamical system is rendered autonomous. Indeed, if K(τ ) = f0(τ − τs)α, in the Big Rip case,
that is for α < −1, for times τ → τs, the parameter m is equal to, m = (−1+α)α(τ−τs)−2−2α
∼ 0, and therefore the
dynamical system of Eq. (99) is rendered autonomous for times near the Big Rip singularity. Therefore ﬁnding the
ﬁxed points of the dynamical system near the Big Rip singularity, may provide some insights on the non-autonomous
system, however, we observe that none of the four critical points of the dynamical system are real when one sets
m = 0. In fact, for a constant m, one requires that m & 17 for a critical point to exist. This indicates that the
dynamics behave quite strange near the Big Rip singularity but this should be studied in all detail in order to be
sure, and the results of this study will be reported elsewhere.

TABLE III: Critical points of the dynamical system.

It would be interesting to investigate in detail what is the correspondence of the dynamical systems corresponding to
the Einstein and Jordan frames, with regards to singular evolution. The most interesting study is to see the behavior
of the dynamical systems near the singularities and compare the behavior of the dynamical systems in both frames.
We hope to address this issue in detail in a future work.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work we have considered how the nature of the singularities changes when one conformally transforms
between the Jordan and Einstein frames of F (R) gravity. First we considered the Jordan and Einstein frames of

15

classical F (R) gravity and explored various illustrative examples of scale factor evolution. We considered a simple
power law potential in the Einstein frame, which exhibits a Type III singularity. However once we transform to the
Jordan frame F (R) gravity, we could see that for certain values of the power law parameter the Type III singularity
can change its behaviour to become a Type I Big Rip singularity.

Next we reviewed the situation when in the Jordan frame, F (R) takes the functional form F (R) = R−n. In this
case the scale factor also behaves as a power law. We ﬁnd that a Type I Big Rip singularity is removed with the
singularity being moved out to inﬁnity, however this introduces a further Type III Big Crunch singularity in the
system. Likewise the Type III singularity can be replaced by a Big Rip singularity, depending on the value of the
parameter n.

A simple singular cosmology was also considered, where the Hubble rate is described by a power law. Such a toy
model is of great use for studying cosmological singularities, since all four types of cosmological singularities can be
exhibited by simply changing the power law parameter. We began with such a cosmology in the Einstein frame and
conformally transformed to the Jordan frame, and it was found that the type of singularity potentially changes. A
Type I singularity was either transformed to another Type I singularity, or the singularity was removed by the time
coordinate changing such that the singularity now occurred at inﬁnity. The Type III singularity remained a Type III
singularity. On the other hand, a Type II singularity was transformed to the more severe Type III singularity, and
likewise the Type IV singularity was potentially transformed to the more severe Type II singularity.

We also examined the equivalence between the Jordan and Einstein frames of unimodular F (R) gravity. We derived
the transformation law to take the canonical Jordan frame unimodular F (R) gravity, where the determinant of the
metric is constrained to be det(g) = 1, to the Einstein frame.
It was found that after conformal transformation,
the unimodular constraint was modiﬁed accordingly, with the determinant of the transformed metric required to be
a particular function of the scalar ﬁeld. This aﬀects the choice of the time coordinate of the FRW metric required
in the Einstein frame. On the other hand, if one starts with an arbitrary unimodular canonical scalar ﬁeld action,
one can only transform to a Jordan frame unimodular F (R) gravity only if the unimodular constraint enforces the
determinant of the metric to be this particular function of the scalar ﬁeld. The behaviour of the unimodular Jordan
and Einstein frames should be studied in greater detail, we will leave such an analysis for future work.

We then examined some particular scale factor evolutions and looked at how the structure of the singularities in
cosmological times was modiﬁed when one transformed between the Jordan and Einstein frames. The power law,
F (R) = R−n and the singular toy model were all examined in this framework too. A very similar behaviour to
standard F (R) gravity was found, with the singularities transforming to diﬀerent types of singularities in much the
same way. These results could also be readily generalized the framework of other modiﬁed F (R) gravities, for example
mimetic F (R) gravity [18]. Finally, we brieﬂy examined the cosmological dynamical system of the vacuum unimodular
F (R) gravity. We found that close to the Big Rip singularity, the dynamical system exhibits some strange behaviour,
with no real critical points present. A further in depth investigation of this phase structure has been left for future
work.
