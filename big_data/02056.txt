ABSTRACT
Considerable eﬀort has been made to increase the scale of
Linked Data. However, because of the openness of the Se-
mantic Web and the ease of extracting Linked Data from
semi-structured sources (e.g., Wikipedia) and unstructured
sources, many Linked Data sources often provide conﬂicting
objects for a certain predicate of a real-world entity. Exist-
ing methods cannot be trivially extended to resolve conﬂicts
in Linked Data because Linked Data has a scale-free prop-
erty. In this demonstration, we present a novel system called
TruthDiscover, to identify the truth in Linked Data with a
scale-free property. First, TruthDiscover leverages the topo-
logical properties of the Source Belief Graph to estimate
the priori beliefs of sources, which are utilized to smooth
the trustworthiness of sources. Second, the Hidden Markov
Random Field is utilized to model interdependencies among
objects for estimating the trust values of objects accurately.
TruthDiscover can visualize the process of resolving conﬂicts
in Linked Data. Experiments results on four datasets show
that TruthDiscover exhibits satisfactory accuracy when con-
fronted with data having a scale-free property.

INTRODUCTION

As of August 2014, the number of available Linked Data
sources has increased from 12 in 2007 to 1,014 with more
than 4 billion RDF triples from a variety of domains[7].
Given that most Linked Data sources have been created
from semi-structured sources (e.g., Wikipedia) and unstruc-
tured sources (e.g., text)[2], conﬂicting objects from multiple

Linked Data sources for a certain predicate of a real-world
entity become inevitable. For example, Freebase1 and Yago
[3] provide diﬀerent values for the predicate dbp:height of
Statue of Liberty. The problem of object conﬂicts has neg-
ative impact to developers aiming to seamlessly consume
and integrate Linked Data in their applications. Hence, this
problem must be addressed.

A straightforward method to resolve object conﬂicts is
majority voting, where the object with the maximum num-
ber of occurrences is regarded as truth. However, we ﬁnd
that this method achieves relatively low accuracy (ranging
from 0.3 to 0.45) in Linked Data because many predicates
have no dominant object. To address the limitation of the
majority voting, many methods based on truth discovery
have been proposed[4, 8]. A common principle of these
methods is that a source which provides trustworthy ob-
jects more often is more reliable, and an object from a reli-
able source is more trustworthy. However, the eﬀectiveness
of existing truth discovery methods is signiﬁcantly aﬀected
by the number of objects provided by each source. In our
previous work [5], we found that the number of conﬂicting
objects provided by most of the sources ranges from 1 to 10,
and only a few sources have many conﬂicting objects. This
ﬁnding indicates that Linked Data has a scale-free property.
Therefore, these methods cannot be trivially extended to
resolve conﬂicts in Linked Data.

In this study, we developed a novel system called TruthDis-
cover2 that can reduce the eﬀect of the scale-free property
on truth discovery. The following are the key features of
TruthDiscover.

1) TruthDiscover leverages the topological properties of
the Source Belief Graph (see Section 2 for the deﬁnition of
Source Belief Graph) to estimate the priori beliefs of sources
for smoothing the trustworthiness of sources.

2) The Hidden Markov Random Field is utilized in this
system to model interdependencies between objects for es-
timating the trust values of objects accurately.

3) TruthDiscover provides a graphical interface to visu-
alize the process of resolving objects conﬂicts for a certain
real-world entity.

The remainder of this demonstration is organized as fol-
lows. Several concepts about TruthDiscover are discussed in
Section 2. Section 3 shows the architecture of TruthDiscover
and explains important technical issues. Section 4 demon-
strates how the TruthDiscover oﬀers a graphical interface
and reports the preliminary results on four domains. Sec-
tion 5 presents the conclusions of this demonstration.
2. PRELIMINARY

Several important notations utilized in TruthDiscover are

introduced in this section.
SameAs Graph: Given a set of RDF triples T , each
RDF triple can be represented by (cid:104)s, p, o(cid:105), where s is a
subject, p is a predicate, and o is an object. A SameAs
Graph can be represented by SG = (V, E), where V =
{s|(cid:104)s, owl:sameAs, o(cid:105) ∈ T} ∪ {o|(cid:104)s, owl:sameAs, o(cid:105) ∈ T} is
a set of vertices, E ⊆ V × V is a set of directed edges with
each edge corresponding to an triple in T .
Source Belief Graph [5]: Given a SameAs Graph SG,
the Source Belief Graph can be denoted by SBG = (W, R),
where W is a set of vertices with each vertex corresponding
to the source name of the vertex in SameAs Graph SG; R
is a multiset of W × W formed by pairs of vertices (µ, ν),
µ, ν ∈ W and each pair (µ, ν) corresponds to an edge in
SameAs Graph SG.

Trustworthiness of Sources [4]: The trustworthiness
of a source ωj is the expected conﬁdence of the objects pro-
vided by ωj, denoted by t(ωj).

Trust Values of Objects [4]: The trust value of an ob-
ject oi is the probability of being correct, denoted by τ (oi).
We let O={oi}m denotes a set of conﬂicting objects for a
certain predicate of a real-world entity. The process of re-
solving object conﬂicts in Linked Data is formally deﬁned as
follows: given a set of conﬂicting objects O, TruthDiscover
will produce one truth for a certain predicate of a real-world
entity. The truth is represented by o∗ = arg max
oi∈O

τ (oi).

3. TRUTHDISCOVER ARCHITECTURE

TruthDiscover will produce one truth for each predicate
that have conﬂicting objects by employing a three-module
framework, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Framework of TruthDiscover

Module I. Entity Resolution and Schema Align-
ment: Firstly, we perform entity co-reference resolution

through the API of sameas.org3, which is a well-known tool,
to identify subjects for the same real-world entities.

Module II. Priori Belief Estimation: In this module,
the priori belief of each source are produced by leveraging
the topological properties of the Source Belief Graph in or-
der to reduce the eﬀect of the scale-free property on truth
discovery.

Module III. Truth computation: Firstly, the trust-
worthiness of each source is automatically computed based
on the trust scores of objects and the priori beliefs of sources.
Therefore, the loopy belief propagation algorithm is applied
to estimate the marginal probabilities of each hidden vari-
able in HMRF. If the changes in all objects after each iter-
ation are less than the threshold, then the object with the
highest trust score is regarded as the truth.

Module I crawls Linked Data and completes the resolution
of schema for a real-world entity, which are not focus of
this paper. so the detailed implementation of the crawling
algorithm will not be described further.
In the following
section, we will only focus on the description of modules II
and III.
3.1 Priori Belief Estimation

Module II automatically estimates the priori belief BR(ωj)
of source ωj by leveraging the topological properties of the
Source Belief Graph SBG.

As we all know, the owl:sameAs property in Linked Data
indicates that two subjects actually refer to the same thing.
When data publishers publish their data as Linked Data
on the web, they add new owl:sameAs triples pointing to
the external equivalent subject[1]. As dictated by logic,
the owl:sameAs property indicates that the data publish-
ers pay their attentions and trusts to the subject provided
by a source they trust because they often select a subject
provided by the source they trust.

When many of owl:sameAs triples are taken together,
they form a directed graph called SameAs Graph. The
SameAs Graph can be converted to a directed multigraph
called the Source Belief Graph, which represents the rela-
tionship between sources. The Source Belief Graph indicates
that the trustworthiness of diﬀerent sources can be propa-
gated through the edges. The edge structure of the Source
Belief Graph is utilized to produce a global reliability rank-
ing of each source. The priori belief BR(ωj) of source ωj
can be deﬁned as follows:

BR(ωj) = (1 − d) + d ∗ (cid:88)

BR(ωl)L(ωl, ωj)

C(ωl)

(1)

ωl∈Bωj

where parameter Bωj denotes the set of sources that point
to ωj; C(ωj) denotes the number of edges going out of source
ωj; L(ωl, ωj) presents the number of edges that ωl point to
ωj and d is a damping factor.

Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the module II that illus-

trates the procedure of priori belief estimation.
3.2 Truth computation

Module III infers the trustworthiness of the source and
the trust value of an object in Linked Data with a scale-free
property. The computation of trustworthiness of the source
and the trust value of an object can be further divided into
three steps.

where Z is a constant selected to ensure that the distribution
is normalized, C denotes the set of all maximal cliques, Xc
indicates the the set of variables of a maximal clique and
ψc(Xc) is a potential function in HMRF.

In order to estimate the marginal probabilities of hid-
den variable, the belief propagation algorithm is adopted in
TruthDiscover. τ (oi) will converge after a suﬃcient number
of iterations.

Step 3. Iterative computation: Because of the inter-
dependencies between the trustworthiness of sources and the
trust value of objects, TruthDiscover adopt iterative strat-
egy to infer the trustworthiness of sources and trust values of
objects. In each step of the iterative procedure, TruthDis-
cover ﬁrst uses the trustworthiness of sources to compute
trust values of objects and then the recomputes the trust-
worthiness of sources. If the changes in all objects after each
iteration are less than the preset threshold, then object with
the maximum trust score is regarded as the truth.

4. DEMONSTRATION DETAILS

We provide an interactive UI to demonstrate the eﬀective-

ness of TruthDiscover on large-scale real RDF datasets.
4.1 Demonstration Setup

TruthDiscover is implemented as a Java Web applica-
tion. It allows users to search their interested subject(e.g.,
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beijing) via a Web-based in-
terface. To visualize the Source Belief Graph and process
of iterative computation, Sigmajs4 (an open-source tool for
integrating network exploration in Web applications) and
JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit5 (an open-source tool for creating
interactive data visualizations on the Web applications) are
incorporated into TruthDiscover for graph/network analysis
and visualization.
4.2 Experimental Evaluation

Four datasets that belong to four domains: people, loca-
tions, organizations and descriptors were constructed based
on the OAEI2011 New York Times dataset6 and BTC20127,
which are two well-known and carefully created datasets of

Figure 2: Screenshot of module II

Step 1. Computing the Trustworthiness of Sources:
In this paper, the trustworthiness t(ωj) of a source ωj is re-
garded as the average probability of the object provided by
ωj being true as deﬁned as follows:

(cid:80)

t(ωj) =

oi∈F (ωj ) τ (oi)
|F (ωj)|

where F (ωj) is the set of objects provided by source ωj.

Considering the scale-free property of Linked Data, it’s
diﬃcult for Equation 2 to estimate the real reliability degree
of source ωj accurately when|F (ωj)| is ”small.” In this study,
the trustworthiness t(ωj) of source ωj is smoothed by priori
belief BR(ωj) based on the averaging strategy as deﬁned as
follows:

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(cid:48)

t

(ωj) =

N BR(ωj) + t(ωj)

N BR(ωj) =

2

BR(ωj) − min
max − min

where N BR(ωj) represents the normalized priori belief of
ωj; max and min indicate the maximum and minimum val-
ues of all priori beliefs respectively.

Step 2. Computing the Trust Values of Objects:
First, the trust value τ (oi) of object oi can be deﬁned as
follows:

(cid:80)
ωj∈Ω(oi) t(cid:48)(ωj)

|Ω(oi)|

τ (oi) =

where Ω(oi) represents the set of sources that provide object
oi.

Second, TruthDiscover exploits following two ﬁndings in
order to estimate the trust values of objects more accurately.
Finding 1: The true objects appear to be similar in diﬀer-
ent sources.
Finding 2: The false objects are less likely to be similar.
These two ﬁndings indicate that the trust value of an object
can propagate to other objects through the similarity rela-
tion. TruthDiscover models the relationship between objects
by adopting a method based on HMRF. We let the obser-
vation variables O={oi}m are a set of conﬂicting objects
for a certain predicate of a real-world entity. The hidden
variables Y = {yi}m are the labels of oi. Each hidden vari-
able yi ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether corresponding object is
a truth. Therefore, the joint distribution of variables in
HMRF is factorized as follows:

P (y1, y2, ..., ym)=

1

We select three well-known state-of-the-art truth discov-
ery methods as baseline including Vote, TruthFinder[8] and
F-Quality Assessment [6]. The parameters of the baseline
methods are set according to the authors suggestions. The
experiments are performed on a desktop computer with In-
tel Core i5-3470 CPU 3.2 GHz with 4 GB main memory,
and Microsoft Windows 7 professional operating system. All
baseline methods were executed in the Eclipse (Java) plat-
form by a single thread. Figure 4 shows the experimental
results of all the methods in terms of accuracy in the four
datasets.

Figure 4: Performance comparison in the Four
datasets

It can be concluded from Figure 4 that TruthDiscover
outperforms the three baseline methods in terms of accu-
racy. The main reason for this superiority is that it’s diﬃcult
for three baseline methods to estimate the reliability degree
of small sources accurately in Linked Data, although these
methods achieved satisfactory accuracy in certain datasets
or applications.

The experimental results of the average change in the
trust value of objects after each iteration are shown in Fig-
ure 5.
It also shows the change decreases rapidly in the
ﬁrst ﬁve iterations, and then reaches a stable stage until the
convergence criterion is satisﬁed.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed an easy-to-use system called TruthDis-
cover, which leverages the topological properties of the Source
Belief Graph and the interdependencies between objects to
infer the trustworthiness of sources and the trust values of
objects. This system is capable of automatically identifying
the truth in massive Linked Data with a scale-free property.
The experimental results show that TruthDiscover exhibits

satisfactory accuracy. The future extension of TruthDis-
cover should include improving the performance of identify-
ing the truth. This improvement can be achieved by identi-
fying the copying relations of diﬀerent sources.

Moreover, voting is a straightforwardmethod.TruthFinder [10]: It’s a well-known method based on truthdiscovery and source reliability estimation used to resolveconflicts. It adopts Bayesian analysis to infer thetrustworthiness of sources and the probabilities of a valuebeing true.F-Quality Assessment [4]: This method is a popularalgorithm used to resolve conflicts in Linked Data. Threefactors, namely, the quality of the source, data conflicts, andconfirmation of values from multiple sources, are leveraged todecide which value should be true value.The parameters of the baseline methods were set according tothe authors’ suggestions. The experiments were conducted on adesktop computer with Intel Core i5-3470 CPU 3.2 GHz with 4GB main memory, and Microsoft Windows 7 professionaloperating system.  All baseline methods were implemented inthe Eclipse (Java) platform8 by a single thread.4.2Experimental ResultsThe experimental results for the four datasets show thatTruthDiscover outperforms the baseline methods in determiningthe truth from multiple conflicting objects in Linked Data with ascale-free property.4.2.1AccuracyIn the experiments, we have two types of data in our datasets:numerical data and string data. For these two types of data, onlyone truth is selected from multiple conflicting objects. Therefore,accuracy as a unified measure is adopted in the experiments forthe two types of data and measured by computing the percentageof matched values between the output of each method andground truths. Figure 8 shows the experimental results of all themethods in terms of accuracy in the four datasets.The average accuracy of TruthDiscover is approximately 0.81 inthe four datasets compared with 0.65, 0.49 and 0.34 of the threebaseline methods. It can be concluded that TruthDiscoveroutperforms the three baseline methods in terms of accuracy.The main reason for this superiority is that it’s difﬁcult for threebaseline methods to estimate the reliability degree of “small”sources accurately in Linked Data, although these methodsachieved satisfactory accuracy in certain datasets or applications.In TruthDiscover, two strategies are adopted to reduce the effectof scale-free property. One strategy is leveraging the topologicalproperties of the Source Belief Graph to estimate the prioribeliefs of sources for smoothing the trustworthiness of sources.The other strategy is that using a method based on HMRF toinfer the trust values of objects accurately by modeling theinterdependencies between objects.8 https://www.eclipse.org/PersonLocationsOrganizationsDescriptors00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91DatasetsAccuracyOur MethodTruthFinderF-Quality AssessmentVotingFigure 8.

The first experiment was conducted to analyzethe convergence of TruthDiscover. The second experiment wasperformed to show the relation between accuracy and iteration.We formulate the problem of resolving conflicts as an iterativecomputation problem because of the interdependencies betweenthe trust value of objects and the trustworthiness of sources.Therefore, convergence significantly affects the performance ofTruthDiscover.

The change decreasesrapidly in the first five iterations, and then reaches a stable stageuntil the convergence criterion is satisﬁed.

This property means that only afew sources have many conflicting objects, and most of thesources provide very few objects. Owing to this property,existing work cannot be trivially extended to resolve objectconflicts in Linked Data. In this study, the problem of resolvingobject conflicts in Linked Data is formulated as a truth discoveryproblem. A truth discovery approach called TruthDiscover isproposed to determine the most trustworthy object. This methodleverages the topological properties of the Source Belief Graphand the interdependencies between objects to infer thetrustworthiness of sources and the trust values of objects.TruthDiscover9 is evaluated in four real-world datasets. Theexperimental results show that TruthDiscover exhibitssatisfactory accuracy.A potential direction for future research is to focus on resolvingout-of-time conflicts by leveraging truth discovery andprovenance information. Another potential future direction is toidentify the copying relations of different sources to improveperformance.6.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe research was supported in part by the National ScienceFoundation of China under Grant Nos. 61221063, 61173112, theDoctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China under GrantNo. 20130201130002, the Ministry of Education InnovationResearch Team under Grant No. IRT13035.7.REFERENCES[1] C.
