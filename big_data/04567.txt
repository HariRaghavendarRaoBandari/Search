ABSTRACT

In this paper, we report the discovery of a binary composed of a brown dwarf and a low-mass M dwarf
from the observation of the microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-0257. Resolution of the very short-lasting
caustic crossing combined with the detection of subtle continuous deviation in the lensing light curve induced
by the Earth’s orbital motion enable us to precisely measure both the Einstein radius θE and the lens parallax
πE, which are the two quantities needed to unambiguously determine the mass and distance to the lens. It is
found that the companion is a substellar brown dwarf with a mass 0.036 ± 0.005 M⊙ (37.7 ± 5.2 MJ) and it is
orbiting an M dwarf with a mass 0.19 ± 0.02 M⊙. The binary is located at a distance 1.25 ± 0.13 kpc toward the
Galactic bulge and the projected separation between the binary components is 0.61 ± 0.07 AU. The separation
scaled by the mass of the host is 3.2 AU/M⊙. Under the assumption that separations scale with masses, then,
the discovered brown dwarf is located in the zone of the brown dwarf desert. With the increasing sample of
brown dwarfs existing in various environments, microlensing will provide a powerful probe of brown dwarfs
in the Galaxy.

1. INTRODUCTION

Since the ﬁrst discoveries of Teide 1 (Rebolo et al. 1995)
and Gliese 229B (Nakajima et al. 1995) in 1995, the last two
decades have witnessed a wealth of brown dwarf (BD) discov-
eries. In the archives “http://DwarfArchives.org” and the one
managed by J. Gagne2, there are thousands of known objects
fall in the temperature regime occupied by brown dwarfs.

Despite the large number of known BDs, our understanding
about their formation processes is still not clear. As a result,
there exist various theories including turbulent fragmentation
of molecular clouds (Boyd & Whitworth 2005), fragmenta-
tion of unstable accretion disks (Stamatellos et al. 2007), ejec-
tion of protostars from prestellar cores (Reipurth & Clarke
2001), photo-erosion of prestellar cores by nearby very bright
stars (Whitworth & Zinnecker 2004), etc. It may be that these
theories apply to different populations of BDs formed under
different environments. For comprehensive studies of the for-
mation mechanism, therefore, it is important to have BD sam-
ples detected by using various methods that are sensitive to
different populations of BDs.

Due to the nature of detecting objects through their gravi-
tational ﬁeld rather than their radiation, microlensing experi-
ments can enrich BD samples by detecting BDs that are dif-
ﬁcult to be detected by other methods such as old and thus
faint or dark brown dwarfs. There have been discovery re-
ports of various types of microlensing BDs as listed in Table
1. These samples include an isolated BD (Gould et al. 2009),

BD companions to faint stars (Bozza et al. 2012; Shin et al.
2012a,c; Bachelet et al. 2012; Street et al. 2013; Park et al.
2013; Jung et al. 2015; Park et al. 2015; Ranc et al. 2015),
BDs hosting planets (Han et al. 2013), and a binary system
of BDs (Choi et al. 2013).

Although rapidly increasing, the number of known mi-
crolensing BDs is still limited due to the difﬁculties in de-
tection. The most important obstacle comes from the difﬁcul-
ties in identifying the BD nature of the lens by measuring its
mass. For general lensing events, the only observable param-
eter related to the mass of the lens is the event time scale tE.
However, the time scale results from the combination of the
lens mass, distance, and relative lens-source speed, and thus
the mass estimated from tE is highly degenerate.

For the unique measurement of the mass, one needs to mea-
sure two additional quantities of the angular Einstein radius
θE and the lens parallax πE. The Einstein radius is measured
by detecting the effect of the ﬁnite source size on the lens-
ing light curve. On the other hand, the lens parallax can be
measured by detecting long-term deviations in lensing light
curves caused by the deviation of the lens-source relative mo-
tion from rectilinear due to the change of the observer’s po-
sition induced by the orbital motion of the Earth around the
Sun (Gould 1992). With the measured θE and πE, the lens
mass and distance are determined by

For a lensing event produced by a single mass,

rare
cases of high-magniﬁcation events where the lens ap-
proaches the source star close enough to pass over the
source star
surface (Witt & Mao 1994; Gould 1994;
Nemiroff & Wickramasinghe 1994; Choi et al. 2012). The
chance to measure the lens parallax is also very slim because
events produced by low-mass BDs tend to have short time
scales while the Earth’s parallactic motion has long-term
effects on lensing light curves.

In contrast to single-lens events, the chance to measure lens
masses is much higher for events produced by binary lenses.
This is ﬁrst because the majority of binary-lens events are in-
volved with caustic crossings during which ﬁnite-source ef-
fects are important and thus the chance to measure θE is high
(Dominik 1995; Gaudi & Gould 1999; Gaudi & Petters 2002;
Pejcha & Heyrovský 2009). Caustics represent the positions
on the source plane at which a point-source magniﬁcation is
inﬁnite and they form a single or multiple closed curves of
extended size. For a ﬁnite-source, the lensing magniﬁcation
corresponds to the mean averaged over the source star surface
and thus deviates from that of a point source. In addition, al-
though masses of BDs are small, binaries including BDs can
be massive and thus events can have time scales long enough
for one to measure πE. As a result, most known microlensing
BDs were detected through the channel of binary-lens events,
e.g. (Shin et al. 2012b).

Another difﬁculty of microlensing BD detection comes
from the fact that BD signals in the lensing light curve do not
have distinctive features. For a binary lens with an extreme
companion/primary mass ratio q like a planet-star pair, the
caustic induced by the companion is very tiny and the signal
of the companion appears as a distinctive short-term anomaly
that is superposed on the smooth and symmetric lensing light
curve of the primary (Gaudi 2012). For BD companions with
mass ratios q ∼ 0.1, the size of the induced caustic can be as
large as those induced by roughly equal-mass binaries. As
a result, it is difﬁcult to immediately notice that the mass of
the companion is in the regime of BDs and thus identifying
BD companions requires complex procedure of modeling ob-
served light curves.

In this paper, we report the discovery of a BD that is bound
to a low-mass star. The BD nature of the companion is iden-
tiﬁed from the mass measurement, which is possible due to
the resolution of a very short-term caustic crossing combined
with the detection of a subtle long-term deviation in the lens-
ing light curve induced by the Earth’s orbital motion.

event occurred on a star
lies toward the Galac-
tic Bulge ﬁeld with equatorial and Galactic coordinates
(α, δ)J2000 = (18h01m47.79s,- 28◦15′43.2′′) and (l,b)J2000 =
(2.38◦,- 2.72◦), respectively. The lensing-induced brighten-
ing of the star was ﬁrst noticed in April, 2014 by the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV: Udalski et al.
2015) survey that is conducted using the 1.3-m Warsaw tele-
scope located at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. In
Figure 1, we present the event light curve which shows a typ-
ical binary-lensing feature of caustic-crossing spikes with a
“U“-shaped trough between them. There also exist two bumps
that occurred before and after the caustic crossings.

With the progress of the event, it was noticed that the mag-
niﬁcation of the lensed star (source) ﬂux was high. Since
high-magniﬁcation events are sensitive to planetary compan-
ions to lenses (Griest & Saﬁzadeh 1998), a second alert was
issued to the microlensing community on April, 18 (HJD ∼
2456765) for intensive follow-up observation. On April 23
(HJD ∼ 2456770), a strong anomaly from a single lensing
light curve was detected. Such an anomaly is usually asso-
ciated with a caustic formed by a binary lens. Caustics form
closed curves and thus caustic crossings of a source star occur
in pairs, i.e. caustic entrance and exit. Since resolving caus-
tic crossings is important to detect ﬁnite-source effects and
thus to measure the Einstein radius of the lens, another alert
was issued. Despite the successive alerts, immediate follow-
up observation could not be done since the anomaly occurred
during the early Bulge season when the time window of the
bulge visibility was narrow and thus telescopes for follow-
up observations were not fully operational. Fortunately, the
source star was located in the ﬁeld toward which stars were

monitored with a very high cadence (& 3 hr- 1) and thus the
caustic exit was densely resolved despite the short duration
(∼ 3.5 hours) of the caustic crossing. See the inset in the up-
per panel of Figure 1, for the enlarged caustic-crossing part of
the light curve.

The ﬁrst four of these parameters describe the source trajec-
tory with respect to the lens: t0 is the time of the source star’s
closest approach to a reference position in the binary lens, u0
is the separation between the source and the reference posi-
tion at t0, α is the angle between the source trajectory and the
binary axis, and tE is the time scale required for the source to
cross the Einstein radius corresponding to the total mass of
the binary. For a reference position on the lens plane, we use
the center of mass of the binary lens. Two other parameters
describe the binary lens: s is the projected separation normal-
ized to θE, and q is the mass ratio of the lens components.
The last basic parameter, ρ, is the source radius normalized
to θE. The normalized source radius is needed to describe
the caustic-crossing part of the light curve that is affected by
ﬁnite-source effects.

The basic features of binary lensing light curves are deter-
mined by the size and shape of the caustic, which depends on
s and q, and the source trajectory with respect to the caustic,
which depends on α. In the initial modeling run, we there-
fore explore the (s,q, α) parameter space by conducting a grid
search, while the other parameters are searched for by mini-
mizing χ2. For the χ2 minimization, we use the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. From a χ2 map in the (s,q, α)
space obtained from this initial run, we identify the approx-
imate locations of the local minima. We then perform a χ2
optimization using all parameters at each local minima and
reﬁne the solution. Finally, we identify a global minimum
by comparing χ2 values of the individual local minima. The

After the caustic exit, there was another bump induced by
the source star’s approach close to a cusp of the caustic. From
the analyses of the light curve conducted after the second
bump, it was noticed that the mass ratio between the binary
lens components is q ∼ 0.1 – 0.2, indicating that the mass
of the companion is very low. From continued analyses con-
ducted with the progress of the event, it was also noticed that
long-term higher-order effects were needed to precisely de-
scribe the observed light curve. The event lasted for about ∼ 3
months before it returned to its baseline magnitude I ∼ 19.

In the analysis, we use 8031 OGLE I-band data points
and 107 V -band data points. Photometry of data were con-
ducted by using the customized pipeline (Udalski 2003) that is
based on the Difference Imaging Analysis code developed by
Wo´zniak (2000). For the use of analysis, we readjust the ﬂux
measurement uncertainties of each data set by ﬁrst adding a
quadratic term to make the cumulative χ2 distribution ordered
by magniﬁcations approximately linear and then rescaling the
uncertainties so that χ2 per degree of freedom (dof) becomes
unity for the best-ﬁt model.

3. MODELING

The basic description of a binary-lensing light curve re-
quires seven lensing parameters: t0, u0, α, tE, s, q, and ρ.

grid search is important to identify the existence of degener-
ate solutions which result in similar light curves despite the
combinations of dramatically different parameters.

For the computation of ﬁnite-source lensing magniﬁca-
tions around the caustic crossings, we use the numerical ray-
shooting method. In this process, we consider limb-darkening
effects of the source star by modeling its surface brightness
proﬁles as Sλ ∝ 1 - Γλ(1 - 3 cos φ/2), where Γλ is the lin-
ear limb-darkening coefﬁcient and φ is the angle between the
light of sight toward the center of the source and the nor-
mal to the source surface (Albrow et al. 1999). From the de-
reddened color and brightness, we ﬁnd that the source is an
F-type main sequence (see section 4 for more details) and
adopt a limb-darkening coefﬁcient ΓI = 0.37 from the catalog
of Claret (2000). In the grid search, we use the map-making
method (Dong et al. 2006), where a magniﬁcation map for a
given (s,q) is constructed to produce many light curves result-
ing from different source trajectories.

We identify two local minima in the close (s < 1) and
wide (s > 1) binary regimes resulting from the well known
close/wide binary degeneracy (Dominik 1999; Bozza 2000;
An 2005). However, the degeneracy is not severe and the
close binary solution provides a better ﬁt with a signiﬁcant
conﬁdence level (∆χ2 & 400). From the modeling run based
on the basic parameters (standard model), we ﬁnd that the
event was produced by a close binary with a projected sepa-
ration s ∼ 0.4 and a mass ratio q ∼ 0.2.

Although the standard model explains the main features of
the light curve, it is found that there exist noticeable residuals
lasting for ∼ 20 days from the ﬁrst bump through the caustic-
crossing feature to the second bump. See the residual from the
standard model at the bottom panel of Figure 1. These residu-
als may indicate the need to consider higher-order effects. It is
known that such a continuous deviation can be caused by ei-
ther the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun (“parallax
effect”: Refsdal 1966; Gould 1992) and/or the change of the
lens position caused by the orbital motion of the lens (“lens or-
bital effect”: Albrow et al. 2000; Dominik 1998).3 In order to
check these higher-order effects, we test additional models. In
the “parallax” and “orbital” models, we consider the parallax
and lens-orbital effects, respectively. In the “orbital+parallax”
model, we consider both higher-order effects. Consideration

3 Besides the parallax and lens-orbital effects, long-term deviations can
also be produced by the orbital motion of the source star if it is a binary. We
discuss this effect in the Appendix.

of the parallax effect requires to include two additional pa-
rameters πE,N and πE,E, that are the two components of the
lens parallax vector πE projected onto the sky along the north
and east equatorial coordinates, respectively. To ﬁrst-order
approximation, the lens-orbital effects are described by two
parameters ds/dt and dα/dt, that are the change rates of the
projected binary separation and the source trajectory angle,
respectively. We measure the parallax parameters with respect
to the reference time that coincides with t0.

FIG. 2.— Cumulative distribution of χ2 difference between the best-ﬁt (or-
bital+parallax) and the standard binary models.

It is known that a pair of parallax solutions with u0 > 0 and
u0 < 0 result in similar light curves due to the mirror sym-
metry of the source trajectory with respect to the binary axis
(Skowron et al. 2011). This so-call “ecliptic degeneracy” is
important especially for events that occur on source stars lo-
cated near the ecliptic plane. The source star of OGLE-2014-
BLG-0257 is located just 4.8◦ away from the ecliptic plane
and thus this degeneracy might be important. We therefore
consider both u0 > 0 and u0 < 0 solutions whenever we con-
sider parallax effects. We note that the pair of the two solu-
tions resulting from the ecliptic degeneracy have similar lens-
ing parameters except for the opposite signs of u0, α, πE,N,

the positions of the binary lens components, where M1 > M2. We note that
the positions of the lens components and the caustic vary in time due to the
orbital motion of the binary lens and thus we mark locations of the lens com-
ponents and the caustic at three different times that are marked in the panel.

and dα/dt.

In Table 2, we present solutions of the lensing parame-
ters for the tested models along with the χ2 values of the
ﬁts. The uncertainties of the individual parameters are es-
timated based on the distributions of points on the MCMC
chain. It is found that the higher-order effects signiﬁcantly
improve the ﬁt. When the parallax and orbital effects are
separately considered, the ﬁt improves by ∆χ2 = 1291.5 and
1035.0, respectively, compared to the standard model. When
both effects are simultaneously considered, the improvement
is ∆χ2 = 1316.8. See the decrease of the residual for the in-
dividual models presented in the lower panels of Figure 1.
Considering that (1) the improvement by the parallax effect is
signiﬁcantly greater than the orbital effect and (2) the χ2 dif-
ference between the parallax-only and parallax+orbital mod-
els (∆χ2 = 25.3) is minor, we judge that the parallax effect
plays a dominant role in the ﬁt improvement. In Figure 2,
we present the cumulative distribution of ∆χ2 of the best-
ﬁt model (orbit+parallax model) with respect to the standard
model. It shows that the improvement occur during the ma-
jor anomalies of the bumps and caustic-crossing features. We
ﬁnd that the two solutions caused by the ecliptic degeneracy
is quite severe although the u0 > 0 solution is preferred over
the u0 < 0 solution by ∆χ2 = 10.2. Since this level of ∆χ2
can often be ascribed to systematics in data, one cannot com-
pletely rule out the u0 < 0 solution. However, we note that the
lensing parameters of the two solutions are similar except for
the signs, and thus the estimated physical parameters are also
similar to each other.

Figure 3 shows the geometry of the lens event, where we
mark the locations of the binary-lens components (M1 and
M2), the caustic, and the source trajectory with respect to the
caustic. We note that the positions of the lens components and
the caustic vary in time due to the orbital motion of the binary
lens and thus we present locations at three different times that

are marked in the panel. It is found that a four-cusp central
caustic of a close binary lens is responsible for the anomalous
features in the lensing light curve. The spikes were produced
by the passage of the source trajectory through the caustic and
the two bumps were produced by the approach of the source
close to the cusps of the caustic before and after the caustic
crossing. Considering that only a curved source trajectory can
approach both cusps close enough to produce the two strong
bumps, the clear detection of the parallax effect was possible
because of the good coverage of the major anomalies. The
usefulness of triple-peak (one caustic crossing plus two cusp
approaches) events in measuring the lens parallax was pointed
out by An & Gould (2001).

4. PHYSICAL QUANTITIES

Among the two quantities needed for the lens mass mea-
surement, the lens parallax is measured from modeling. The
Einstein radius is determined from the combination of the nor-
malized source radius measured from modeling and the angu-
lar source radius θ∗ by θE = θ∗/ρ.

We estimate the θ∗ from the de-reddened color (V -

I)0
and brightness I0 of the source star. To measure the color
and brightness, we ﬁrst locate the source star in the instru-
mental color-magnitude diagram of neighboring stars in the
same ﬁeld and then calibrate the color and brightness by
using the centroid of the giant clump (GC) as a reference
(Yoo et al. 2004). The GC centroid can be used as a stan-
dard candle because its de-reddened color and brightness,
(V -
I,I)0,GC = (1.06,14.35) (Bensby et al. 2011; Nataf et al.
2013), are known. Figure 4 shows the locations of the source
and GC centroid in the instrumental color-magnitude dia-
gram. The measured offsets in color and magnitude between
the source and the GC are ∆(V -
I) = - 0.50, ∆I = 3.92, re-
spectively. Then, the estimated de-reddened color and the
brightness of the source star are (V -
I,I)0 = (0.56,18.26), re-
spectively, indicating that the source is a mid F-type main se-
quence. We then convert the estimated (V -
I)0 into (V - K)0 =
1.16 using the color-color relation of Bessell & Brett (1988)
and ﬁnally determine θ∗ using the color-angular radius rela-
tion of Kervella et al. (2004). We ﬁnd that the angular radius

of the source star is θ∗ = 0.59 ± 0.04 µas. Then the angu-

mined as

= 5.28 ± 0.38 mas yr- 1.

We note that the values of θE and µ are very similar for the
u0 < 0 solution due to the similarity in the measured parame-
ters of ρ and tE.

In Table 2, we present the physical parameters of the lens
estimated from the measured θE and πE, including the masses
of the individual lens components, M1 and M2, the distance to
the lens, DL, and the projected separations between the com-
ponents, r⊥. Also presented is the ratio of transverse kinetic
to potential energy of the binary system estimated by,

where M = M1 +M2 is the total mass of the binary. For a bound
system, the ratio (KE/PE)⊥ ≤ (KE/PE) < 1. The measured
ratio is very small and thus satisﬁes the bound-system check.
From the estimated physical parameters, we ﬁnd that the
lens is a binary composed of a substellar BD with a mass
M2 = 0.036 ± 0.005 M⊙ (37.7 ± 5.2 MJ) and a low-mass M

dwarf with a mass M1 = 0.19 ±0.02 M⊙. The binary is located
at a distance DL = 1.25 ± 0.13 kpc. The projected separation
between the lens components is r⊥ = 0.61 ±0.07 AU. The sep-
aration scaled by the mass of the host is r⊥/M1 = 3.2 AU/M⊙.
Under the assumption that separations scale with masses,
then, the discovered BD is located in the zone of brown-dwarf
desert where BDs are rare.

The lens masses estimated from the u0 < 0 solution (M1 =
0.15 ± 0.02 M⊙ and M2 = 0.027 ± 0.003 M⊙) are slightly
smaller than those estimated from the u0 > 0 solution due
to the smaller value of the measured lens parallax. We note,
however, that the difference does not affect the nature of the
lens (a BD around a M dwarf).

5. SUMMARY

Microlensing provides a powerful probe to study faint or
dark objects since these objects can be studied independent of
their emitted radiation. By taking advantage of the method,
we discovered a brown dwarf orbiting a faint star by analyzing
the light curve of the gravitational microlensing event OGLE-
2014-BLG-0257. Dense resolution of the short-lasting caus-
tic crossing combined with the detection of subtle deviation
induced by parallax effects, we were able to measure both
the Einstein radius and the lens parallax. This enabled us to
unambiguously determine the physical parameters of the lens
system including the mass, distance, and projected separation.
It was found that the lens is a binary composed of a brown
dwarf and a low-mass star. It was also found that the brown
dwarf companion is located in the zone of the brown dwarf
desert.

XALLARAP EFFECTS

FIG. A1.— Upper panel: χ2 distribution of the xallarap ﬁt with respect to the orbital period. Lower panel: distribution of the lower mass limit of the source
companion. The dashed line in the upper panel represents the χ2 value of the best-ﬁt orbital + parallax model. The shaded areas represent the regions where the
estimated minimum mass of the source companion is greater than 5 M⊙.

It is known that long-term deviations in lensing light curves can also be produced by the orbital motion of the source star
because it is possible for the source orbital motion to mimic parallax effects (Smith et al. 2003; Poindexter et al. 2005). This
effect is often referred to as “xallarap effect”, where xallarap is parallax spelled in reverse. We investigate whether the observed
long-term deviation can be explained by xallarap effects rather than parallax effects.

In order to consider xallarap effects, one need 5 additional parameters. These parameters include the orbital period P, the phase
angle and inclination of the orbit, and the north and east components of the xallarap vector, ξE,N and ξE,E. See details about the
parameters in Dong et al. (2009). The magnitude of the xallarap vector ξ = (ξ2
E,E)1/2 corresponds to the major axis of the
orbit with respect to the center of mass, aS, normalized to the projected Einstein radius onto the source plane, ˆrE, i.e.

where DS is the distance to the source. The value aS is related to the semi-major axis of the orbit by aS = aMS2/(MS1 + MS2),
where MS1 and MS2 are the masses of the binary source components. With equation (A1) combined with the Kepler’s third law,
the mass of the source companion is expressed in terms of ξE as

where mass, period, and distance are expressed in M⊙, yr, and AU, respectively. From the fact that (MS1 + MS2)/MS2 > 1, then
the the lower mass limit of the source companion is expressed as

In the upper panel of Figure A1, we present the distribution of χ2 with respect to the orbital period. In the lower panel, we also
present the distribution of the lower mass limit of the source companion estimated by the relation (A3). From the χ2 distribution,
it is found that the best xallarap solution provides a ﬁt that is worse than the best orbital + parallax solution by χ2 = 49.4, which
is statistically important. Furthermore, the estimated minimum mass of the source companion for the best-ﬁt xallarap solution is
MS2 ∼ 100 M⊙, implying that the solution is physically unlikely. Therefore, we conclude that xallarap effects cannot explain the
observed parallax signal.
