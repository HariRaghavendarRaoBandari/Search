Abstract.
In this paper we present a mathematical analysis of thin ﬁlm ﬂow and heat
transfer to a laminar liquid ﬁlm from a horizontal stretching sheet. The ﬂow of thin
liquid ﬁlm and subsequent heat transfer from the stretching surface is investigated with
the aid of similarity transformations. Similarity transfor-mations are used to convert
unsteady boundary layer equations to a system of non-linear ordinary diﬀerential
equations. The resulting non-linear diﬀerential equations are solved numerically using
Runge-kutta-Fehlberg and Newton-Raphson schemes. A relationship between ﬁlm
thickness β and the unsteadiness parameter S is found, the eﬀect of unsteadiness
parameter S, and the Prandtl number P r, Magnetic ﬁeld parameter M n, Radiation
parameter N r and viscous dissipation parameter Ec and heat source parameter γ on
the temperature distributions are presented and discussed in detail. Present analysis
shows that the combined eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld, thermal radiation, heat source and
viscous dissipation. The results which form special case of the present study are in
excellent agreement with the results reported in the literature.

Keywords: Thin ﬁlm, unsteady stretching sheet, thermal radiation, heat source, MHD,
boundary layer ﬂow.

1. Introduction

The analysis of ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transfer across a thin liquid ﬁlm has attracted the at-
tention of a number of researchers because of its possible practical applications in many
branches of science and technology. The knowledge of ﬂow and heat transfer within a
thin liquid ﬁlm is crucial in understanding the coating process and design of various
heat exchangers and chemical processing equipment. Other applications include wire
and ﬁber coating, food stuﬀ processing reactor ﬂuidization, transpiration cooling and

so on. The prime aim in almost every extrusion application is to maintain the surface
quality of the extrudate. All coating processes demand a smooth glossy surface to meet
the requirements for best appearance and optimum service properties such as low fric-
tion, transparency and strength.The problem of extrusion of thin surface layers needs
special attention to gain some knowledge for controlling the coating product eﬃciently.

Heat transfer analysis due to a continuously moving stretching surface through an
ambient ﬂuid is one of the thrust areas of current research. This ﬁnds its application
over a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines, especially in the ﬁeld of
chemical engineering. Many chemical engineering processes like metallurgical process,
polymer extrusion process involves cooling of a molten liquid being stretched into a
cooling system. In such processes the ﬂuid mechanical properties of the penultimate
product would mainly depend on two things, one is the cooling liquid used and other is
the rate of stretching. For example, in a melt spinning process, the extrudate from the
die is generally drawn and simultaneously stretched into a ﬁlament or sheet, which is
thereafter solidiﬁed through rapid quenching or gradual cooling by direct contact with

water or the coolant liquid. The stretching provides a unidirectional orientation to the
extrudate, thereby improving the ﬂuid mechanical properties. The quality of the ﬁnal
product greatly depends on the rate of cooling and the stretching rate. The choice of
an appropriate cooling liquid is crucial as it has a direct impact on rate of cooling and
care must be taken to exercise optimum stretching rate otherwise sudden stretching may
spoil the properties desired for the ﬁnal outcome. Some industrially important liquids
like synthetic oils, dilute polymeric solutions such as 5.4% of polyisobutylene in cetane
can be used as eﬀective coolant liquids (see [1]). Since the quality of the ﬁnal product
in such extrusion processes depend considerably on the ﬂow and heat transfer charac-
teristics within a thin liquid ﬁlm over a stretching sheet, the analysis and fundamental
understanding of the momentum and thermal transports for such processes are very
important.

In 1961, Sakiadis [2] initiated the study of boundary layer ﬂow over a continuous
solid surface with constant speed. This ﬂow was Blasius type, in which the boundary
layer thickness is increased with distance from the slit. Crane [3] was the ﬁrst among
others to consider the steady two-dimensional ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid driven by a
stretching elastic ﬂat sheet which moves in its own plane with a velocity varying lin-
early with the distance from a ﬁxed point. Bujurke [4] analysed the second order ﬂuid
over a stretching sheet using momentum integral technique. Ray et al. [5] developed the
thin liquid ﬁlm on surface of spinning disk in presence of transverse magnetic ﬁeld. The
ﬁlm thickness is supress within the spinning time but increase in the magnetic ﬁeld for
ﬁxed time. Dandpat et al. [6] analysed thin ﬁlm ﬂow on rotating disc under the action
of thermocapillary force. Andersson et al. [7] studied heat transfer in a liquid ﬁlm on an
horizontal stretching sheet. He also investigated ﬁlm thickeness and unsteady stretching
sheet. Dandpat et al. [8] analyzed thermocapillarity ﬂow in a liquid ﬁlm on a horizontal
stretching sheet. Thermocapillarity inﬂuence to thicken the ﬁlm and increase the rate
of heat transfer between the sheet and ﬁlm. Wang [9] analyzed the thin ﬁlm ﬂow over
a horizontal stretching sheet. Analytically solved by homotopy analysis method it is
helful to understand the ﬂow and heat transfer mechanisms of the liquid ﬁlm. Dandpat
et al. [10] studied two diemensional laminar thin ﬁlm ﬂow on an unsteady stretching
sheet. Momentum equations are solved analytically in ﬂow situations by using singular
petrubution method. Santra et al. [11] analyzed the thermocapillary eﬀects on unsteady
thin ﬁlm ﬂow over a heated hoeizontal stretching sheet. The eﬀect of thermocapillary
in the temperature distrubution in stretching direction decreases at higher values of
Prandtl number and Biot number. Noor et al. [12] studied the eﬀects of themocapillary
and magnetic ﬁeld in a thin ﬁlm ﬂow over an unsteady stretching surface. Analytical
method is solved by homotopy analysis method to show the ﬂow and heat transfer rate
of the thin liquid ﬁlm. Dandpat et al. [13] shown the eﬀects of variable ﬂuid properties
on thin liquid ﬁlm ﬂow over an unsteady heated stretching surface.The eﬀect of variable
ﬂuid viscosity on velocity proﬁle increases when viscosity decreases due to decrease of
temperature along the stretching sheet.

There are extensive works in literature concerning the production of thin ﬂuid ﬁlm
either on a vertical wall achieved through the action of gravity or that over a rotating disc
achieved through the action of centrifugal forces. Dandpat et al. [14] studied numerically
two layer thin ﬁlm ﬂow on a rotating disk under the assumptions of planar interface and
free surface. Numerically solved by ﬁnite element method to show the ﬁlm thickness
varies at diﬀerent time zone depend on the rate of ratational speed of the disk. Dandpat
et al. [15] analyzed magneto hydromagnetic thin ﬁlm ﬂow over an unsteady heated
stretching sheet. Film thickness equations are derived using long wave approximation
theory of thin liquid ﬁlm. Li et al
[16] studied thin ﬁlm ﬂo and heat transfer over
an unsteady stretching sheet in presence of thermal radiation, variable heat ﬂux and
internal heating. Thermal radiation leads to increase in temperature distrubution. It
means to fall the rate of cooling for the thin ﬁlm ﬂow. Vajravelu et al [17] explore the the
eﬀects of variable thermal conductivity and the viscous dissipation on the heat transfer
of an incompressible power-law liquid ﬁlm ﬂow over an unsteady porous stretching sheet.
Thermal conductivity, viscous dissipation and powe law index plays signiﬁcant role in
heat transfer process. Aziz et al. [18] investigated thin ﬁlm ﬂow thin ﬁlm ﬂow and heat
transfer over an unsteady permeable stretching sheet. Numerically solved by homotopy
analysis method to show ﬂow and heat transfer rate of the thin liquid ﬁlm. Gul et
al. [19] analyzed the hydromagnetic thin ﬂim ﬂow over an unsteady second grade ﬂuid
past a verticle oscilating belt. Analytically solved by Adomain decomposition method
and optimal homotopy asymptotic method. Megahed et al. [20] studied casson thin ﬁlm
ﬂow over an unsteady stretching sheet with viscous dissipation and variable heat ﬂux
involving boundary conditions of slip eﬀects. Viscous dissipation and heat ﬂux coupled
with the velocity slip eﬀects plays signiﬁcant role in the rate of heat transfer.Alice et al.
[21] investigated the eﬀects of feedback control, applied via a suction boundary condition
and based observation of the interference height on the dynamic and stability of a thin
layer of ﬂuid ﬂowing down in inclined plane. Here they con-sidered two diﬀerent models
Benny and weighted residual models that accounts for the ﬂuid injection through the
wall.
The purpose of present study is to give numerical analysis of hydromagnetic thin ﬁlm
ﬂow over an unsteady stretching sheet in presence of thermal radiation and interna
heating with uniform ﬁlm thickness. The governing equations are transformed into
highly non-linear ordinary diﬀerential equations and then solved numerically by using
Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and newton-Raphason schemes based on shooting technique.
Numerical computation has been carried out for thermal boundary layer for various
values of ﬂow parameters. Comparison with known results (Wang [9]) for certain
particular cases is in excellent agreement.

2. Formulation of the Problem

Let us consider a thin elastic sheet which emerges from a narrow slit at the origin of a
Cartesian co-ordinate system for investigations as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The
continuous sheet at y = 0 is parallel with the x-axis and moves in its own plane with
the velocity.

U (x, t) =

bx
1 − αt

,

(1)

where b and α are both positive constants with dimension per time. The surface
temperature Ts of the stretching sheet is assumed to vary with the distance x from the
slit as

(cid:34) bx2

(cid:35)

2ν

Ts(x, t) = T0 − Tref

(1 − αt)− 3
2 ,

(2)

where T0 is the temperature at the slit and Tref can be taken as a constant reference
temperature such that 0 ≤ Tref ≤ T0. The term bx2
ν(1−αt) can be recognized as the local
Reynolds number based on the surface velocity U . The expression (1) for the velocity
of the sheet U (x, t) reﬂects that the elastic sheet which is ﬁxed at the origin is stretched
by applying a force in the positive x-direction and the eﬀective stretching rate
(1−αt)
increase with time as 0 ≤ α < 1. With the same analogy the expression for the surface
temperature Ts(x, t) given by (2) represents a situation in which the sheet temperature
decreases from T0 at the slit in proportion to x2 and such that the amount of temperature
reduction along the sheet increases with time. The applied transverse magnetic ﬁeld is
assumed to be of variable kind and is chosen in its special form as

b

B(x, t) = B0(1 − αt)− 1
2 .

(3)

The particular form of the expressions for U (x, t), Ts(x, t) and B(x, t) are chosen
so as to facilitate the construction of a new similarity transformation which enables in
transforming the governing partial diﬀerential equations of momentum and heat trans-
port into a set of non-linear ordinary diﬀerential equations.

Consider a thin elastic thin liquid ﬁlm of uniform thickness h(t) lying on the hor-
izontal stretching sheet (Fig. 1). The x-axis is chosen in the direction along which the
sheet is set to motion and the y-axis is taken perpendicular to it. The ﬂuid motion within
the ﬁlm is primarily caused solely by stretching of the sheet. The sheet is stretched by
the action of two equal and opposite forces along the x-axis. The sheet is assumed to
have velocity U as deﬁned in (1) and the ﬂow ﬁeld is exposed to the inﬂuence of an
external transverse magnetic ﬁeld of strength B as deﬁned in (3). We have neglected
the eﬀect of latent heat due to evaporation by assuming the liquid to be nonvolatile.
Further the buoyancy is neglected due to the relatively thin liquid ﬁlm, but it is not so
thin that intermolecular forces come into play. The velocity and temperature ﬁelds of
the thin liquid ﬁlm obey the following boundary layer equations

T 4 can be expressed as a linear combination of the temperature, we expand T 4 in a
Taylors series about T∞ as follows

T 4 = T 4∞ + 4T 3∞(T − T∞) + 6T 2∞(T − T∞)2 + ....,

and neglecting higher order terms beyond the ﬁrst degree in (T − T∞) we get

The pressure in the surrounding gas phase is assumed to be uniform and the gravity
force gives rise to a hydrostatic pressure variation in the liquid ﬁlm. In order to justify
the boundary layer approximation, the length scale in the primary ﬂow direction must
be signiﬁcantly larger than the length scale in the cross stream direction. We choose the
representative measure of the ﬁlm thickness to be ( ν
2 so that the scale ratio is large
(cid:29). This choice of length scale enables us to employ the boundary layer
enough i.e.
approximations. Further it is assumed that the induced Magnetic ﬁeld is negligibly
small.

At this juncture we make a note that the mathematical problem is implicitly
formulated only for x ≤ 0. Further it is assumed that the surface of the planar liquid
ﬁlm is smooth so as to avoid the complications due to surface waves. The inﬂuence of
interfacial shear due to the quiescent atmosphere, in other words the eﬀect of surface
tension is assumed to be negligible. The viscous shear stress τ = µ( ∂u
∂y ) and the heat
ﬂux q = −k( ∂T

∂y ) vanish at the adiabatic free surface (at y = h).

The mathematical problem deﬁned through (5)-(6) and (11)-(13) transforms exactly

b is the dimensionless measure of the unsteadiness and the prime indicates

(24)

Yet β is an unknown constant, which should be determined as an integral part of
the boundary value problem. The rate at which ﬁlm thickness varies can be obtained
by diﬀerentiating (24) with respect to t, in the form

Thus the kinematic constraint at y = h(t) given by (13) transforms into the free
surface condition (25). It is noteworthy that the momentum boundary layer equation
deﬁned by (19) subject to the relevant boundary conditions (21)-(23) is decoupled from
the thermal ﬁeld, on the other hand the temperature ﬁeld θ(η) is coupled with the
velocity ﬁeld f (η). Since the sheet is stretched horizontally the convection least aﬀects
the ﬂow (i.e., buoyancy eﬀect is negligibly small) and hence there is a one-way coupling
of velocity and thermal ﬁelds.

4. Numerical Solution

The system of non-linear diﬀerential equations (19) and (20) subjected to the boundary
conditions (21)-(23) are solved numerically, using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and Newton-
Raphson schemes based shooting method.
In this method, third order
non-linear ordinary diﬀerential equation (19) and second order non-linear ordinary
diﬀerential equation (20) have been reduced to ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations as
follows:

Here f0(η) = f (η) and θ0(η) = θ(η). The above boundary value problem is ﬁrst
converted into an initial value problem by appropriately guessing the missing slopes
f2(0) and θ1(0). The resulting IVP is solved by shooting method for a set of parameters
appearing in the governing equations and a known value of S. The value of β is so
adjusted that condition (35) holds. This is done on the trial and error basis. The value
for which condition (35) holds is taken as the appropriate ﬁlm thickness and the IVP
is ﬁnally solved using this value of β. The step length of h = 0.01 is employed for the
computation purpose. The convergence criterion largely depends on fairly good guesses
of the initial conditions in the shooting technique. The iterative process is terminated
until the relative diﬀerence between the current and the previous iterative values of
2 up to a tolerance of 10−6. Once the convergence in
f (β) matches with the value of Sβ
achieved we employed shooting technique with the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and Newton-
Raphason schemes to determine the unknown in order to convert the boundary value
problem to initial value problem. Once all initial conditions are determined, the resulting
diﬀerential equations are determined, the resulting diﬀerential equations were integrated
using initial value solver. For this purpose Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg scheme was used.

5. Results and Disscussion

In this work we analyze hydromagnetic thin ﬁlm ﬂow and heat transfer characteristics
over an unsteady stretching sheet is investigated, in presence of viscous dissipation,
thermal radiation and internal heating. Both numerical and analytical solutions are
presented. The similarity transformations were used to transform the governing partial
diﬀerential equations of ﬂow, heat transfer into a system of non-linear ordinary diﬀeren-
tial equations. The accuracy of the method was established. The numerical solution ob-
tained by shooting method together with Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and Newton-Raphson
schemes. It is note worthy to mention that the solution exists only for small value of
unsteadiness parameter 0 ≤ S ≤ 2. Moreover, when S → 0 the solution approaches to
the analytical solution obtained by Crane [3] with inﬁnitely thick layer of ﬂuid (β → ∞).
The other limiting solution corresponding to S → 2 represents a liquid ﬁlm of inﬁnites-
imal thickness (β → 0). The numerical results are obtained for 0 ≤ S ≤ 2. Present
results are compared with some of the earlier published results in some limiting cases
which are tabulated in Table 2. The eﬀects of magnetic parameter on various ﬂuid
dynamic quantities are shown in Figs. 2 - 9 for diﬀerent unsteadiness parameter.

Figure 2 highlights the eﬀect of M n on the dimensionless wall heat ﬂux −θ(cid:48)(0). It
is found from this plot that the dimensionless wall heat ﬂux −θ(cid:48)(0) decreases with the
increasing values of M n. The eﬀect of M n on −θ(cid:48)(0) is observed for diﬀerent values of
unsteadiness parameter S.

The variation of temperature distribution with magnetic ﬁeld parameter M n in
Figures 3(a) and (b), temperature distribution for two diﬀerent values of unsteadiness
parameter S. The thermal boundary layer thickness increases with the increasing values
of M n. The increasing frictional drag due to the Lorentz force is responsible for increas-
ing the thermal boundary layer thickness. The results thicken the thermal boundary
layer.

Figures 4(a) and (b) demonstrate the eﬀect of Prandtl number P r on the temper-
ature proﬁles for two diﬀerent values of unsteadiness parameter S. These plots reveals
the fact that for a particular value of P r the temperature increases monotonically from
the free surface temperature Ts to wall velocity the T0 as observed by Anderson et al. [7].
The thermal boundary layer thickness decreases drastically for high values of P r i.e.,
low thermal diﬀusivity.

Figures 5(a) and (b) project the eﬀect of Eckert number Ec on the temperature
distribution for two diﬀerent values of unsteadiness parameter S. The eﬀect of viscous
dissipation is to enhance the temperature in the thin liquid ﬁlm. i.e., increasing values
of Ec contributes in thickening of thermal boundary layer. For eﬀective cooling of the
sheet a ﬂuid of low viscosity is preferable.

Thin ﬁlm ﬂow and heat transfer over an unsteady stretching sheet

11

The eﬀect of radiation parameter N r on the horizontal temperature distribution are
shown in Figs. 6(a) and (b) for two diﬀerent values of unsteadiness parameter S. From
these plots it is clear that thermal radiation enhance the temperature in the boundary
layer region in the ﬂuid ﬁlm. Which leads to fall in the rate of cooling for thin ﬁlm
ﬂow. Thermal radiation deﬁnes the rlative contribution of conduction heat transfer to
thermal radiation transfer.

Figures 7 (a) and (b) present the eﬀect of heat source/sink parameter γ on the tem-
perature distribution for diﬀerent values of unsteadiness parameter S. The eﬀect of sink
parameter γ < 0 reduces the temperature in the ﬂuid as the eﬀect of source parameter
γ > 0 enhances the temperature. For eﬀective cooling of the sheet, heat sink is preferred.

Figures 8 - 9 present the eﬀect of wall temperature gradient −θ(cid:48)(0) at the stretching

sheet for P r, Ec and N r for diﬀerent values of unsteadiness parameter S.

Table 2 give the comparison of present results with that of Wang [9]. With out any
doubt, from these tables, we can claim that our results are in excellent agreement with
that of Wang [9] under some limiting cases.

6. Conclusions

The problem of laminar thin ﬁlm ﬂow and heat transfer over an unsteady stretching
sheet in presence of variable transverse magnetic ﬁeld including Viscous dissipation,
thermal radiation and internal heating is analyzed. The eﬃcient numerical method of
Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and Newton-Raphson schemes based on shooting technique is
used to solve the governing equations. The eﬀects of several parameters controlling the
temperature distribution are shown graphically. Some of the important ﬁndings of our
analysis obtained by the graphical representation are listed below:

(i) The eﬀect of Magnetic ﬁeld on a electrically conducting ﬂuid is to increase in

the thermal boundary layer, by increasing in magnetic parameter M n the rate of
transport of ﬂuid particles reduces due to Lorentz force are generated in the ﬂuid
particles, which in turn causes the enhancement of the temperature ﬁeld.

(ii) For a wide range of P r, the eﬀect Viscous dissipation is found to increase the
dimensionless free-surface temperature θ(β) for the ﬂuid cooling case. The impact of
Viscous dissipation on θ(β) diminishes in the two limiting cases: P r → 0, P r → ∞,
in which situations θ(β) approaches unity and zero respectively.

(iii) The energy dissipation (being indicated by the Eckert number) due to heating,
viscous dissipation and deformation work has the eﬀect to thicken the thermal
boundary layer increases in the temperature proﬁle, and hence reduce the heat
transfer rate from the surface.

(iv) The eﬀect of internal heat source/sink is to generate temperature for increasing
positive values and absorb temperature for decreasing values. However negative
value of temperature dependent parameter better suited for cooling purpose.

(v) The eﬀect of thermal radiation parameter N r increases in thermal boundary
layer, which in turn causes the enhancement of heat transfer, physically increasing
the radiation parameter produces signiﬁcant increase in the thickness of thermal
boundary layer.
