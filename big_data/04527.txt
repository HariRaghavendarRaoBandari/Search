THE FUBINI PRODUCT AND ITS APPLICATIONS

OTGONBAYAR UUYE AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS

Abstract. The Fubini product of operator spaces provide a powerful tool for analysing prop-
erties of tensor products. In this paper we review the the theory of Fubini products and apply
it to the problem of computing invariant parts of dynamical systems. In particular, we study
the invariant translation approximation property of discrete groups.

1. Introduction

The Fubini product of C∗-algebras was ﬁrst deﬁned and studied by J. Tomiyama [19, 20, 21,
22] and Wassermann [23].
It is now a standard tool in the study of operator algebras and
operator spaces. See for instance [10, 1, 13, 11, 15, 14, 3]. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, a
comprehensive treatment of the subject is missing from the literature.

In this paper, we try to the remedy the situation. In Section 2, we give a survey of the theory
of Fubini products and its applications. Most of the results in Section 2 appear scattered in
numerous articles, most notably [20, 23, 9, 10, 15, 6, 12]. After brieﬂy recalling some deﬁnitions
concerning operator spaces in Subsection 2.1, we deﬁne the Fubini product and prove its funda-
mental properties regarding functoriality, intersections, kernels, relative commutants, invariant
elements, combinations in Subsections 2.2-2.8. In Subsection 2.9, we review the relation between
the operator approximation property and the slice map property.

In Section 3, we apply the results in Section 2 to the study of groups with the invariant translation
approximation property (ITAP) of J. Roe [17, Section 11.5.3]. In Subsection 3.1, we recall the
deﬁnition of the uniform Roe algebra. In Subsection 3.2, we analyse the uniform Roe algebra
of a product space. Finally, in Subsection 3.3, we study the ITAP of product groups. We
show that for countable discrete groups G and H, if G has the approximation property (AP) of
Haagerup-Kraus [6], the product G × H has the ITAP if and only if H has the ITAP.

Finally, in Section 4, we study the crossed product version of the Fubini product.

Let H be a Hilbert space and let B(H) denote the Banach space of bounded linear operators on
H. The ideal of compact operators on H is denoted K(H) ⊆ B(H).

Deﬁnition 2.1. An operator space on H is a closed subspace of B(H).

Deﬁnition 2.2. For a ∈ B(H) and b ∈ B(K), we write a ⊗ b for the corresponding element in
B(H ⊗ K). For subsets A ⊆ B(H) and B ⊆ B(K), we write A × B for the subset {a ⊗ b | a ∈
A, b ∈ B} ⊆ B(H ⊗ K) and A ⊙ B for the linear span of A × B.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let A ⊆ B(H) and B ⊆ B(K) be operator spaces. We deﬁne the tensor product
A ⊗ B as the norm closure of A ⊙ B or, equivalently, the closed linear span of A × B in B(H ⊗ K).

Remark 2.4. Suppose A ⊆ B(H1), A ⊆ B(H2), B ⊆ B(K1) and B ⊆ B(K2). Then for any
x ∈ A ⊙ B, we have

kxkB(H1⊗K1) = kxkB(H2⊗K2).

Lemma 2.5 (([19, Lemma 3])). Suppose S, A ⊆ B(H) and T , B ⊆ B(K). If S ⊗ T ⊆ A ⊗ B,
then S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.6. A linear map φ : A → B of operator spaces is completely bounded if the map
φ⊙idD : A⊙D → B ⊙D is bounded for all operator spaces D. We write φ⊗idD for the extension
A ⊗ D → B ⊗ D.

Completely contractive and completely isometric maps are deﬁned similarly.

Deﬁnition 2.7. The completely bounded norm of a completely bounded map φ : A → B is

where H is a separable inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space.

kφkcb := (cid:13)(cid:13)φ ⊗ idK(H) : A ⊗ K(H) → B ⊗ K(H)(cid:13)(cid:13) ,

Lemma 2.8. Let φ : A → B be a completely bounded map. Then we have

kφkcb = sup
n

kφ ⊗ idMn : A ⊗ Mn → B ⊗ Mnk .

Moreover, for any operator space D, we have

kφ ⊗ idD k ≤ kφkcb.

(cid:3)

The following extension theorem of Wittstock says that B(H) is an injective object in the category
of operator spaces and completely contractive maps.

Theorem 2.9 ((Wittstock)). Let S ⊆ A be operator spaces and let φ : S → B(H) be a completely
bounded map. Then there exists a completely bounded extension ψ : A → B(H) with kψkcb =
kφkcb.
(cid:3)

2.2. The Fubini Product.

Deﬁnition 2.10 ((cf. [20], [23])). Let S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B be operator spaces. The Fubini product
F (S, T, A ⊗ B) of S and T is deﬁned as the set of all x ∈ A ⊗ B such that (φ ⊗ idB)(x) ∈ T for
all φ ∈ A∗ and (idA ⊗ψ)(x) ∈ S for all ψ ∈ B∗.

Remark 2.11. We have

S ⊗ T ⊆ F (S, T, A ⊗ B) ⊆ A ⊗ B.

THE FUBINI PRODUCT AND ITS APPLICATIONS

Lemma 2.12. Let K, L be subspaces of A∗, B∗ respectively such that the closed unit ball of K
and L are weak-∗-dense in the unit balls of A∗ and B∗ respectively. Then for any S ⊆ A, T ⊆ B
operator spaces the Fubini product F (S, T, A ⊗ B) equals the set

{x ∈ A ⊗ B | (φ ⊗ idB)(x) ∈ T and (idA ⊗ψ)(x) ∈ S for all φ ∈ K, ψ ∈ L}.

The assumptions are for instance satisﬁed if K and L are the set of normal linear functionals in
faithful representations of A and B.

Proof. Suppose that (φ ⊗ idB)(x) ∈ T for all φ ∈ L. We need to show that (φ ⊗ idB)(x) ∈ T for
all φ ∈ A∗. Let φ ∈ A∗ and let (φn) ⊆ L be a bounded sequence (or net) converging pointwise
(i.e. in the weak-∗-sense) to φ. Then (φn ⊗ idB)(z) → (φ ⊗ idB)(z) for all z ∈ A ⊙ B and using
norm boundedness of φn ⊗ idB, an ε/3-argument shows that the same holds for z ∈ A ⊗ B. Since
(φn ⊗ idB)(x) ∈ T by assumption we conclude that (φ ⊗ idB)(x) ∈ T .
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.13. We say that (S, T, A ⊗ B) has the slice map property if

F (S, T, A ⊗ B) = S ⊗ T.

2.3. Functoriality.

Lemma 2.14. For i = 1, 2, let Si ⊆ Ai and Ti ⊆ Bi be operator spaces. Suppose that completely
bounded maps σ : A1 → A2 and τ : B1 → B2 satisfy σ(S1) ⊆ S2 and τ (T1) ⊆ T2. Then

(σ ⊗ τ )(F (S1, T1, A1 ⊗ B1)) ⊆ F (S2, T2, A2 ⊗ B2).

Proof. Let x ∈ F (S1, T1, A1 ⊗ B1). Let φ2 ∈ A∗
T1, thus

2 and let φ1 := φ2 ◦ σ ∈ A∗

1. Then (φ1 ⊗ idB1 )(x) ∈

(φ2 ⊗ idB2 )[(σ ⊗ τ )(x)] = τ [(φ1 ⊗ idB1 )(x)]

belongs to T2. Similarly for ψ2 ∈ B∗
F (S2, T2, A2 ⊗ B2).

2 , we have (idA2 ⊗ψ2)[(σ ⊗ τ )(x)] ∈ S2. Thus (σ ⊗ τ )(x) ∈
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.15. Let S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B be operator spaces. Let σ : A → A and τ : B → B be
completely bounded maps. If σ restricts to the identity on S and τ on T , then σ ⊗ τ restricts to
the identity on F (S, T, A ⊗ B).

Proof. For x ∈ F (S, T, A ⊗ B) and φ ∈ A∗ and ψ ∈ B∗, we have

hφ ⊗ ψ, (σ ⊗ τ )(x)i = hφ, σ[(idA ⊗(ψ ◦ τ ))(x)]i

= hφ, (idA ⊗(ψ ◦ τ ))(x)i
= hψ, τ [(φ ⊗ idB)(x)]i
= hφ ⊗ ψ, xi.

Thus (σ ⊗ τ )(x) = x.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.16 ((cf. [10, Lemma 2])). For i = 1, 2, let S ⊆ Ai and T ⊆ Bi be operator
spaces. Suppose that completely bounded maps σ1 : A1 → A2, σ2 : A2 → A1 and τ1 : B1 → B2,
τ2 : B2 → B1 satisfy, for i = 1, 2, σi(s) = s for s ∈ S and τi(t) = t for t ∈ T , then σ1 ⊗ τ1
restricts to an isomorphism

F (S, T, A1 ⊗ B1) ∼= F (S, T, A2 ⊗ B2).

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.17 ((cf. [20, Proposition 3.7])). Let S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B be operator spaces. If there
exist completely bounded projections A → S and B → T , then (S, T, A ⊗ B) has the slice map
property:

F (S, T, A ⊗ B) = S ⊗ T.

2.4. Intersections.

Lemma 2.18. For operator spaces S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B, we have

F (S, T, A ⊗ B) = F (A, T, A ⊗ B) ∩ F (S, B, A ⊗ B).

More generally, for families of operator spaces {Sα ⊆ A} and {Tβ ⊆ B}, we have

F (∩αSα, ∩βTβ, A ⊗ B) = ∩α,βF (Sα, Tβ, A ⊗ B).

Proof. Clear from the deﬁnitions.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.19 ((cf. [23, Corollary 5])). Let S1, S2 ⊆ A and T1, T2 ⊆ B be operator spaces. If
(S1 ∩ S2, T1 ∩ T2, A ⊗ B) has the slice map property, then

(S1 ∩ S2) ⊗ (T1 ∩ T2) = (S1 ⊗ T1) ∩ (S2 ⊗ T2).

Proof. We have

2.5. Kernels.

(S1 ∩ S2) ⊗ (T1 ∩ T2) ⊆ (S1 ⊗ T1) ∩ (S2 ⊗ T2)

⊆ F (S1, T1, A ⊗ B) ∩ F (S2, T2, A ⊗ B)
= F (S1 ∩ S2, T1 ∩ T2, A ⊗ B).

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.20. Let A, B and D be operator spaces and let τ : B → D be a completely
bounded map. Then

F (A, ker(τ ), A ⊗ B) = ker(idA ⊗τ ).

Proof. Let x ∈ A ⊗ B. For φ ∈ A∗, we have

τ [(φ ⊗ idB)(x)] = (φ ⊗ idD)[(idA ⊗τ )(x)].

Thus x ∈ F (A, ker(τ ), A ⊗ B) iﬀ x ∈ ker(idA ⊗τ ).

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.21 ((cf. [20, Corollary 1])). Let A, B and D be operator spaces and let τ : B → D
be a completely bounded map. Then the equality

A ⊗ ker(τ ) = ker(idA ⊗τ )

holds if and only if the triple (A, ker(τ ), A ⊗ B) has the slice map property.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.22. Let A, B, C and D be operator spaces and let {σα : A → C} and {τβ : B → D}
be families of completely bounded maps. Then

F (∩α ker(σα), ∩β ker(τβ ), A ⊗ B) = (∩α ker(σα ⊗ idB)) ∩ (∩β ker(idA ⊗τβ)).

Proof. Follows from Lemma 2.18 and Proposition 2.20.

2.6. Relative Commutants. As a corollary we obtain the following.

Proposition 2.23. Let S, A ⊆ B(H) and T , B ⊆ B(K) be operator spaces. Then we have

F (S′ ∩ A, T ′ ∩ B, A ⊗ B) = (S ⊗ C1B(K) + C1B(H) ⊗ T )′ ∩ (A ⊗ B).

Proof. For s ∈ S, let σs := [−, s] : A → B(H). Then σs is completely bounded and

σs ⊗ idB = [−, s ⊗ 1B(K)] : A ⊗ B → B(H) ⊗ B.

Moreover, we have

∩s∈S ker(σs) = S′ ∩ A and

∩s∈S ker(σs ⊗ idB) = (S ⊗ C1B(K))′ ∩ (A ⊗ B).

Similary, τt := [−, t] : B → B(K), t ∈ T , are completely bounded and

∩t∈T ker(τt) = T ′ ∩ B and

∩t∈T ker(idA ⊗τt) = (C1B(H) ⊗ T )′ ∩ (A ⊗ B).

Thus Theorem 2.22 completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.24 ((cf. [9, Theorem 1] and [20, Corollary 2])). Let S, A ⊆ B(H) and T , B ⊆ B(K)
and suppose 1B(H) ∈ S and 1B(K) ∈ T . Then the equality

holds if and only if the triple (S′ ∩ A, T ′ ∩ B, A ⊗ B) has the slice map property.

(S′ ∩ A) ⊗ (T ′ ∩ B) = (S ⊗ T )′ ∩ (A ⊗ B)

Proof. Follows from Proposition 2.23, since under the unitality conditions, we have

(S ⊗ T )′ = (S ⊗ C1B(K) + C1B(H) ⊗ T )′.

Corollary 2.25 ((cf. [9, Corollary 1])). Let A and B be C∗-algebras. Then

Z(A) ⊗ Z(B) ∼= Z(A ⊗ B),

where Z denotes the center.

Proof. Follows from Corollary 2.24 and Remark 2.40.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

2.7. Invariant Elements. The following can be deduced from Proposition 2.23. We give a
direct proof.

Proposition 2.26. Let A and B be operator spaces. Suppose that the group G acts on A and
the group H acts on B by completely bounded maps. Then

F (AG, BH , A ⊗ B) = (A ⊗ B)G×H .

Proof. For g ∈ G, let σg := (idA −g) : A → A. Then σg is completely bounded and

σg ⊗ idB = (idA⊗B −1H × g) : A ⊗ B → A ⊗ B.

Moreover, we have

∩g∈G ker(σg) = AG

∩g∈G ker(σg ⊗ idB) = (A ⊗ B)G×{1H }.

6

OTGONBAYAR UUYE AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS

Similarly, τh := (idB −h) : B → B, h ∈ H, are completely bounded and

∩h∈H ker(τh) = BH

∩h∈H ker(idA ⊗τh) = (A ⊗ B){1G}×H .

Now Theorem 2.22 completes the proof, since

(A ⊗ B)G×H = (A ⊗ B)G×{1H } ∩ (A ⊗ B){1G}×H .

Corollary 2.27 ((cf. [23, Corollary 7])). Let A and B be operator spaces. Suppose that group G
acts on A and group H acts on B by completely bounded maps. Then the equality

holds if and only if the triple (AG, BH , A ⊗ B) has the slice map property.

AG ⊗ BH = (A ⊗ B)G×H

(cid:3)

2.8. Combinations.

Lemma 2.28. Let S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B be operator spaces. Then

F (S, T, A ⊗ T ) = (A ⊗ T ) ∩ F (S, B, A ⊗ B).

Proof. Clear since any element of T ∗ extends to an element of B∗.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.29 (([12, Lemma 2.6])). Let S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B be operator spaces. If (A, T, A ⊗ B)
has the slice map property, then

F (S, T, A ⊗ T ) = F (S, T, A ⊗ B)

Proof. We have

F (S, T, A ⊗ T ) = (A ⊗ T ) ∩ F (S, B, A ⊗ B)

= F (A, T, A ⊗ B) ∩ F (S, B, A ⊗ B)

= F (S, T, A ⊗ B),

by Lemma 2.28 and Lemma 2.18.

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.30 (([12, Corollary 2.7])). Let S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B be operator spaces. If (A, T, A⊗
B) and (S, T, A ⊗ T ) have the slice map property, then (S, T, S ⊗ B) and (S, T, A ⊗ B) also have
the slice map property. Conversely, if (S, T, A ⊗ B) has the slice map property, then (S, T, A ⊗ T )
and (S, T, S ⊗ B) also have the slice map property.

Proof. Follows from Lemma 2.29 and the following commutative diagram of inclusions:

2.9. The Operator Approximation Property. In this subsection, we review the connection
between the operator approximation property and the slice map property. This is partly for
completeness and partly because we use it in Section 3. However, we have nothing new to add
here to the excellent work of Kraus [15] and Haagerup-Kraus [6].

Deﬁnition 2.31. We say that A has the slice map property for B if (A, T, A ⊗ B) has the slice
map property for all operator spaces T ⊆ B.

Deﬁnition 2.32. We write F (A, B) for the space of ﬁnite-rank maps A → B.

Lemma 2.33. Finite-rank maps of operator spaces are completely bounded.

(cid:3)

Let A and B be operator spaces and let x ∈ A ⊗ B. Deﬁne

FB(x) := {(Φ ⊗ idB)(x) | Φ ∈ F (A, A)}= ⊆ A ⊗ B,
TB(x) := {(φ ⊗ idB)(x) | φ ∈ A∗}= ⊆ B.

Then

Moreover, we have

FB(x) = A ⊗ TB(x).

F (A, T, A ⊗ B) = {x ∈ A ⊗ B | TB(x) ⊆ T }

= {x ∈ A ⊗ B | FB(x) ⊆ A ⊗ T }.

Lemma 2.34 (([15, Theorem 5.4])). Let A and B be operator spaces. Then A has the slice map
property for B if and only if x ∈ FB(x) for all x ∈ A ⊗ B.

Proof. (⇒): Let x ∈ A⊗ B. Clearly, x ∈ F (A, TB(x), A⊗ B). Since A has the slice map property
for B, we have F (A, TB(x), A ⊗ B) = A ⊗ TB(x) = FB(x). Thus x ∈ FB(x).

(⇐): Let T ⊆ B be operator subspace and let x ∈ F (A, T, A ⊗ B). Then FB(x) ⊆ A ⊗ T . Thus
x ∈ A ⊗ T .
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.35. An operator space B is matrix stable if for each n ∈ N, there is a completely
bounded surjection B → B ⊗ Mn.

Deﬁnition 2.36. We say that A has the operator approximation property (OAP) for B if there
is a net Φα ∈ F (A, A) such that Φα ⊗ idB converges to idA ⊗ idB in point-norm topology.

Theorem 2.37 ((cf. [15, Theorem 5.4])). Let A and B be operator spaces. If A has the operator
approximation property for B, then A has the slice map property for B. If B is matrix stable,
then the converse also holds.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement is clear from Lemma 2.34.

Now we prove the second statement. Suppose B is stable. Let x1, . . . , xn ∈ A ⊗ B and let ǫ > 0.
Let C := B ⊗ Mn and choose a completely bounded surjection π : B → C.

Let x := x1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ xn ∈ A ⊗ B ⊗ Mn = A ⊗ C. Then there exists y ∈ A ⊗ B such that x =
(idA ⊗π)(y). By Lemma 2.34, there is Φ ∈ F (A, A) such that k(Φ ⊗ idB)(y) − yk < ǫ/(kπkcb + 1).
Then

k(Φ ⊗ idC )(x) − xk = k(Φ ⊗ idC )((idA ⊗π)(y)) − (idA ⊗π)(y)k

= k(idA ⊗π)((Φ ⊗ idB)(y) − y)k
< ǫ.

It follows, for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n, we have k(Φ ⊗ idB)(xk) − xkk < ǫ.

(cid:3)

8

OTGONBAYAR UUYE AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS

Deﬁnition 2.38. Let H is a separable inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space. We say that A has
the operator approximation property (OAP) if A has the OAP for K(H) and the strong operator
approximation property (SOAP) if A has the OAP for B(H).

Lemma 2.39. If an operator space has the strong OAP, then it has the OAP for any B.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.40. We have the implications

CPAP =⇒ CBAP =⇒ strong OAP =⇒ OAP.

Deﬁnition 2.41 (([6, Deﬁnition 1.1])). A countable discrete group G has the approximation
property (AP) if the constant function 1 is in the σ(M0A(G), Q(G))-closure of A(G) in M0A(G),
where A(G) is the Fourier algebra of G and M0A(G) is the space of completely bounded Fourier
multipliers of G and Q(G) is the standard predual of M0A(G).

Theorem 2.42 (([6, Theorem 2.1])). A countable discrete group G has the AP if and only if its
reduced group C∗-algebra C∗

λ(G) has the (strong) OAP.

Proof. See the original article [6] or [3, Section 12.4].

(cid:3)

3. The Invariant Translation Approximation Property

In this section, we apply the results in Section 2 to the problem of studying the invariant part
of the uniform Roe algebra.

3.1. Uniform Roe Algebras.

Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that a (countable discrete) metric space is of bounded geometry if for
any R > 0, there is NR < ∞ such that all balls of radius at most R have at most NR elements.

Deﬁnition 3.2 ((cf. [17, Section 4.1] and [24, Section 2])). Let (X, d) be a metric space of
bounded geometry and let S ⊆ B(H) be a subset. For R > 0 and M > 0, let AR,M (X, S) denote
the set of X × X-matrices with values in S satisfying

(1) for any x1, x2 ∈ X with d(x1, x2) > R, we have a(x1, x2) = 0 and

(2) for any x1, x2 ∈ X, we have ka(x1, x2)kB(H) ≤ M .

Let A(X, S) := ∪R,M AR,M (X, S). For S = C, we write AR,M (X) and A(X).

Lemma 3.3. Under the natural action, elements of AR,M (X, S) act on l2(X, H) ∼= l2X ⊗ H as
bounded operators of norm at most M · NR.

Proof. The action is given by

(aξ)(x1) := X

x2

a(x1, x2)ξ(x2),

ξ ∈ l2X ⊗ H.

Thus we identify A(X, S) ⊆ B(l2X ⊗ H).

Lemma 3.4. For any S ⊆ B(H), we have

in B(l2X ⊗ H).

A(X) × S ⊆ A(X, S) ⊆ A(X, S) ⊆ A(X, S)

Proof. Only the last inclusion needs checking. Take a ∈ AR,M (X, S). For each positive integer
n ≥ 1, we deﬁne an ∈ A(X, S) as follows. For x1, x2 ∈ X, if d(x1, x2) > R, then let an(x1, x2) =
0, and if d(x1, x2) ≤ R, then choose an(x1, x2) ∈ S to satisfy kan(x1, x2) − a(x1, x2)k ≤ 1/n.
Then an ∈ AR,M+1(X, S) and kan −ak ≤ NR/n by Lemma 3.3. Hence the sequence an converges
to a in B(l2X ⊗ H) as n → ∞ and thus a ∈ A(X, S).
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.5 ((cf. [17, Section 4.4] [24])). Let X be a metric space of bounded geometry and
let S ⊆ B(H) be an operator space. The uniform Roe operator space C∗
u(X, S) is the closure of
A(X, S) in B(l2X ⊗ H). For S = C, we write C∗

u(X).

Lemma 3.6. For any operator space S ⊆ B(H), we have

C∗

u(X) ⊗ S ⊆ C∗

u(X, S).

Proof. Follows from Lemma 3.4.

(cid:3)

3.2. Products. For metric spaces (X, dX ) and (Y, dY ), we equip the product X × Y with the
metric

dX×Y ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) := max{dX (x1, x2), dY (y1, y2)}.

If X and Y are of bounded geometry, then so is X × Y .

Lemma 3.7. Let X and Y be metric spaces of bounded geometry and let S ⊆ B(H) be a subset.
Then for R, R′ > 0 and M , M ′ > 0 we have a natural inclusion

where R′′ := max{R, R′} and M ′′ := M · M ′. In particular, we have

AR,M (X) × AR′,M ′(Y, S) ⊆ AR′′,M ′′ (X × Y, S),

A(X) × A(Y, S) ⊆ A(X × Y, S)

in B(l2X ⊗ l2Y ⊗ H).

Proof. Take a ∈ AR,M (X) and b ∈ AR′,M ′ (Y, S) and let R′′ = max{R, R′} and M ′′ = M · M ′.
For x1, x2 ∈ X and y1, y2 ∈ Y , we deﬁne

(a ⊗ b)((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) := a(x1, x2) ⊗ b(y1, y2).

(1) For x1, x2 ∈ X and y1, y2 ∈ Y with d((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) > R′′ = max{R, R′}, we have
either d(x1, x2) > R′′ ≥ R thus a(x1, x2) = 0, or d(y1, y2) > R′′ ≥ R′ thus b(y1, y2) = 0,
hence (a ⊗ b)((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = a(x1, x2) ⊗ b(y1, y2) = 0 and

(2) For x1, x2 ∈ X and y1, y2 ∈ Y , we have k(a ⊗ b)((x1, y1), (x2, y2))k = ka(x1, x2)k ·

kb(y1, y2)k ≤ M · M ′ = M ′′.

Hence a ⊗ b belongs to AR′′,M ′′ (X × Y, S). The last statement is clear.

Lemma 3.8. Let X and Y be metric spaces of bounded geometry and let S ⊆ B(H) be a subset.
Then for R > 0 and M > 0, we have a natural inclusion

AR,M (X × Y, S) ⊆ AR,M ′ (X, AR,M (Y, S)),

where M ′ := M · N X

R . In particular, we have

A(X × Y, S) ⊆ A(X, A(Y, S))

in B(l2X ⊗ l2Y ⊗ H).

Proof. Take a ∈ AR,M (X×Y, S). Fix x1, x2 ∈ X and consider bx1,x2(y1, y2) := a((x1, y1), (x2, y2)).
First we show that bx1,x2 is an element of AR,M (Y, S).

(1) For y1, y2 ∈ Y with d(y1, y2) > R, we have d((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) ≥ d(y1, y2) > R, thus

bx1,x2(y1, y2) = a((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = 0.

(2) For y1, y2 ∈ Y , we have kbx1,x2(y1, y2)k = ka((x1, y1), (x2, y2))k ≤ M .

Now we show that b is an element of AR,M ′ (X, AR,M (Y, S)).

(1) For x1, x2 ∈ X with d(x1, x2) > R and for any y1, y2 ∈ Y , we have d((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) ≥

d(x1, x2) > R, thus

i.e. bx1,x2 = 0

bx1,x2(y1, y2) = a((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = 0

(2) For x1, x2 ∈ X, we have kbx1,x2k ≤ M · N X

R = M ′ by Lemma 3.3.

3.3. The Invariant Translation Approximation Property. Let G be a countable discrete
group. Let |G| denote the metric space of bounded geometry on G associated to a proper length
function. Then G acts on |G| isometrically by right translations.

Example 3.10. Let G be a countable discrete group. Then A(G) is the ∗-algebra generated
u|G| ∼=
by C[G] and l∞(G), and therefore C∗
l∞(G) ⋊r G and (C∗
u|G|, where L(G) denote the von Neumann algebra
generated by C∗

u|G| = C∗(l∞(G), λ(G)).

It is well-known that C∗

u|G|)G = L(G) ∩ C∗

λ(G). See [3, Section 5.1].

Deﬁnition 3.11. Let S be an operator space. We say G has the invariant translation approxi-
mation property (ITAP) for S, if we have

C∗

λ(G) ⊗ S = C∗

u(|G|, S)G.

Deﬁnition 3.12. We say G has the (strong) invariant translation approximation property if it
has the ITAP for (all operator spaces S ⊆ B(H)) C.

The following theorem connects the strong ITAP to the AP.

Theorem 3.13 (([24])). Let G be a countable discrete group. Then G has the AP if and only if
G is exact and has the strong ITAP.
(cid:3)

Proof. See [24].

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.14. Any subgroup of a group with ITAP has ITAP.

λ(H) ⊆ C∗

u|H| ⊆ C∗

Proof. Let H be a subgroup of G and suppose that G has the ITAP. Using the coset decomposition
of G one checks that we have inclusions C∗
u|G|.
Now the multiplier with respect to the indicator function of H, being positive deﬁnite, induces
conditional expectations EL : L(G) → L(H), Eu : C∗
λ(H).
The restrictions of EL and Eu to C∗
u|H| then
x ∈ L(G) ∩ C∗
λ(G) and EL(x) = x as well as Eu(x) = x. It follows that Eλ(x) = x i.e.
x ∈ C∗
(cid:3)

λ(G) are equal to Eλ. Now let x ∈ L(H) ∩ C∗

λ(G), L(H) ⊆ L(G) and C∗

λ(H) and thus H also has the ITAP.

u|H| and Eλ : C∗

λ(G) → C∗

u|G| → C∗

u|G| = C∗

Now we consider products.

Lemma 3.15. Let G and H be countable discrete groups with proper length functions lG : G →
R≥0 and lH : G → R≥0. Then lG×H : G × H → R≥0 given by lG×H(g, h) = max{lG(g), lH(h)} is
a proper length function and |G × H| = |G| × |H|.

Proof. First we check that l is a length function. Indeed, we have

lG×H (e, e) = max{lG(e), lH(e)} = 0

and

lG×H(g−1, h−1) = max{lG(g−1), lH (h−1)}

= max{lG(g), lH (h)}
= lG×H(g, h)

12

and ﬁnally

lG×H (gg′, hh′) = max{lG(gg′), lH (hh′)}

≤ max{lG(g) + lG(g′), lH (h) + lH (h′)}
≤ max{lG(g), lH (h)} + max{lG(g′), lH (h′)}
= lG×H (g, h) + lG×H(g′, h′).

Moreover, it is clear that l is proper. Finally, we have

d|G×H|((g1, h1), (g2, h2)) = lG×H(g1g−1

2 , h1h−1
2 )

2 ), lH (h1h−1

= max{lG(g1g−1
= max{d|G|(g1, g2), d|H|(h1, h2)}
= d|G|×|H|((g1, h1), (g2, h2)).

2 )}

Proposition 3.16. Let G and H be countable discrete groups. If G × H has the ITAP, then G
and H also have the ITAP and the triple

(cid:3)

((C∗

u|G|)G, (C∗

u|H|)H , C∗

has the slice map property.

Proof. By Theorem 3.9, we have

C∗

λ(G × H) = C∗

λ(H)

u|H|)H
u|H|)G×H

Thus G and H have the ITAP by Lemma 2.5 (this is also immediate from Theorem 3.14). The
last statement follows from Corollary 2.27.
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.17. Let G be a countable discrete group with the AP and let B be an operator space
equipped with an action of a group H by completely bounded maps. Then we have

C∗

λ(G) ⊗ BH = C∗

u(|G|, B)G×H .

Proof. Clearly, we have

C∗

λ(G) ⊗ BH ⊆ (C∗

u|G|)G ⊗ BH ⊆ (C∗

u|G| ⊗ B)G×H ⊆ C∗

u(|G|, B)G×H .

Since G has AP, it has the strong ITAP by Theorem 3.13, thus

C∗

u(|G|, B)G = C∗

λ(G) ⊗ B.

Moreover, the C∗-algebra C∗
we have

λ(G) has the strong OAP by Theorem 2.42, thus by Proposition 2.26,

(C∗

This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.18. Let G and H be countable discrete groups. If G has the AP and H has the
ITAP, then G × H has the ITAP.

Proof. By Theorem 3.9, we have

Thus, by Theorem 3.17, we have

(C∗

Since H has ITAP, we have (C∗

λ(H) = C∗

so that G × H has the ITAP.

Corollary 3.19. Let G and H be countable discrete groups. Suppose G has the AP. Then G× H
has the ITAP if and only if H has the ITAP.

4. The Fubini Crossed Product

In this section, we study the crossed product version of the Fubini product.

4.1. The Fubini Crossed Product. Let G be a countable discrete group. A G-operator space
is an operator space equipped with a completely isometric action of G.

Let A ⊆ B(H) be an operator space equipped with a completely isometric action α of G. Deﬁne
a new action π of A on H ⊗ l2G by π(a)(v ⊗ δg) := αg−1 (a)v ⊗ δg and let G act on H ⊗ l2G by
λ(g)(v ⊗ δh) := v ⊗ δgh.

The reduced crossed product A ⋊r G is deﬁned as the operator space spanned by {π(a)λ(g) ∈
B(H ⊗ l2(G)) | a ∈ A, g ∈ G}.

Deﬁnition 4.1 (([14, Lemma 2.1])). For any ψ ∈ B(l2G)∗, there is a natural, completely
bounded slice-map idA ⋊rψ : A ⋊r G → A. If S ⊆ A is a G-invariant operator subspace, then
the Fubini crossed product F (S, A ⋊r G) is deﬁned as the set of all x ∈ A ⋊r G such that
(idA ⋊rψ)(x) ∈ S for all ψ ∈ B(l2G)∗.

The slice map idA ⋊rψ is given by the restriction of the von Neumann slice map which maps
A∗∗⊗B(l2G) to A∗∗.

14

OTGONBAYAR UUYE AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS

Remark 4.2. We have

S ⋊r G ⊆ F (S, A ⋊r G) ⊆ A ⋊r G.

In fact, many of the formal properties of the Fubini product hold for Fubini crossed products,
usually with the same proof.

Deﬁnition 4.3. We say that (S, A ⋊r G) has the slice map property if

Lemma 4.4. If the action of G on A is trivial, then

F (S, A ⋊r G) = S ⋊r G.

F (S, A ⋊r G) = F (S, C∗

λ(G), A ⊗ C∗

λ(G)).

Proof. Since the action of G on A is trivial, we have A ⋊r G = A ⊗ C∗

Hence we have F (S, C∗
tional ψ ∈ C∗
in the weak∗ topology. Now it is easy to see that for any x ∈ A⊗C∗
converge to idA ⋊ψ(x) in norm. It follows that F (S, A ⋊r G) ⊆ F (S, C∗

λ(G)) ⊆ F (S, A ⋊r G). By Goldstine’s theorem for any func-
λ(G)∗, there exists a bounded net ψn ∈ B(l2(G))∗ with kψnk ≤ kψk, converging to ψ
λ(G), the elements idA ⊗ψn(x)

λ(G), A ⊗ C∗

λ(G)).

(cid:3)

Example 4.5. Let l∞(G) act on l2G by multiplication. Then G acts on l∞(G) by left mul-
tiplication and c0(G) ⊆ l∞(G) is an invariant C∗-subalgebra. The Fubini crossed product
F (c0(G), l∞(G) ⋊r G) is the ideal of all ghost operators on |G|. Thus G is exact if and only
if (c0(G), l∞(G) ⋊r G) has the slice map property by [18].

Lemma 4.6. For families of G-invariant operator subspaces {Sα ⊆ A} we have

F (∩αSα, A ⋊r G) = ∩αF (Sα, A ⋊r G).

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.7 ((cf. [14, Proposition 2.2])). Let B and D be G-operator spaces and let σ : B →
D be a completely bounded G-equivariant map. Then

F (ker(σ), B ⋊r G) = ker(σ ⋊r G).

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.8. Let G and H be countable discrete groups and let A be a (G × H)-operator space.
Then

F (AH , A ⋊r G) = (A ⋊r G)H .

Proof. For h ∈ H, let αh : A → A denote the action by h. Then αh is G-equivariant. Let
σh := idA −αh. Then σh ⋊r G = idA⋊rG −αh ⋊r G : A ⋊r G → A ⋊r G. The proof follows from
Proposition 4.7 and Lemma 4.6, since

∩h∈H ker(σh) = AH ,

∩h∈H ker(σh ⋊r G) = (A ⋊r G)H .

Example 4.9. Let l∞(G) act on l2G by multiplication. Then G acts on l∞(G) by left multipli-
u|G| ∼= l∞(G) ⋊r G; moreover, thinking of C as embedded into
cation. As already pointed out C∗
l∞(G) via the constant functions we have C∗
u(|G|)G = F (C, l∞(G) ⋊r G). Thus G has the ITAP
if and only if (C, l∞(G) ⋊r G) has the slice map property.

Proposition 4.10. Let G be a discrete group with the AP. Then for any S ⊆ A, we have
F (S, A ⋊r G) = S ⋊r G.

Proof. Since G has the AP there exists a net (uα) in M0A(G) ∩ cc(G) converging to 1 ∈ M0A(G)
in the σ(M0A(G), Q(G)) topology. As explained in [24], this implies that the net of Schur
u(|G|, A)) given by ˆMuα([as,t]) = [uα(st−1)as,t] converges to the identity
multipliers ˆMuα ∈ CB(C∗
map in the point norm topology. Fixing a faithful representation A ֒→ B(K) we can think of
A ⋊r G ⊆ B(K ⊗ ℓ2(G)) as matrices indexed by G with entries in A. Since the hδs, · δti is a
normal functional on B(ℓ2(G)) whose slice map gives the s, t entry of the matrix in B(K ⊗ ℓ2(G))
we can characterise F (S, A ⋊r G) as those matrices in A ⋊r G with entries in S. Thus it is clear
that F (S, A ⋊r G) ⊆ C∗
u(|G|, A). Moreover, since each uα has ﬁnite support, it is easy to check
that ˆMuα(F (S, A ⋊r G)) is contained in span{π(s)λ(g) | s ∈ S, g ∈ G} ⊆ S ⋊r G. It follows that
S ⋊r G ∋ ˆMα(x) → x for any x ∈ F (S, A ⋊ G), concluding the proof.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.11. If F (S, A ⋊r G) = S ⋊r G for all S ⊆ A, then G has the AP.

Proof. Considering trivial actions we see that C∗
λ(G) has the slice map property for any operator
space A by Lemma 4.4, thus have the OAP by Kraus’ theorem (Theorem 2.37). Hence G has
the AP by Haagerup-Kraus theorem (Theorem 2.42).
(cid:3)

4.2. Functoriality.

Lemma 4.12. Let S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B be G-operator spaces. Suppose that a completely bounded
map σ : A → B maps σ(S) ⊆ T . Then

(σ ⋊r G)(F (S, A ⋊r G)) ⊆ F (T, B ⋊r G).

Proof. Let x ∈ F (S, A ⋊r G). For any ψ ∈ B(l2G)∗, we have (idA ⋊rψ)(x) ∈ S, thus

(idA ⋊rψ)[(σ ⋊r G)(x)] = σ[(idA ⋊rψ)(x)]

belongs to T . Hence the lemma holds.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.13. Let S ⊆ A be G-operator spaces. Let σ : A → A be a completely bounded G-map.
If σ restricts to the identity on S, then σ ⋊r G restricts to the identity on F (S, A ⋊r G).

Proof. For x ∈ F (S, A ⋊r G) and ψ ∈ B(l2G)∗, we have

(idA ⋊rψ)[(σ ⋊r G)(x)] = σ[(idA ⋊rψ)(x)] = (idA ⋊rψ)(x).

Thus (σ ⋊r G)(x) = x.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.14 ((cf. [10, Lemma 2])). Let S ⊆ A and S ⊆ B be G-operator spaces. If φ : A → B
and ψ : B → A are completely bounded G-maps such that (ψ ◦ φ)|S = idS and (φ ◦ ψ)|S = idS,
then there is a completely bounded G-isomorphism F (S, A ⋊r G) → F (S, B ⋊r G) which is the
identity on S ⋊r G.
(cid:3)

OTGONBAYAR UUYE AND JOACHIM ZACHARIAS

Injective envelopes of C∗-algebras, operator systems and operator spaces have been considered
by various authors [7, 8, 2, 5]. The G-injective envelope has only been deﬁned for operator
systems in the literature. However, the deﬁnitions and constructions are all analogous. First
one has to ﬁnd an injective extension of the given object in the appropriate category and then
minimise it in such a way that uniqueness is automatic. Therefore in the following, we omit the
proofs. For a G-operator space S, we denote the G-injective envelope by IG(S). We write I(S)
if G is trivial.

Lemma 4.15 ((cf. [10, Theorem 4])). Let S be a G-operator system and let A be a G-injective
operator system containing S. Then the Fubini crossed product F (S, A ⋊r G) is independent of
A.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.16. The Fubini crossed product F (S, A ⋊r G) is called the universal Fubini crossed
product of S by G and denoted F (S, G). It is the largest Fubini crossed product of S.

We say that S has the universal slice map property for G if S ⋊r G = F (S, G).

Example 4.17. For a discrete group G, the space c0(G) has the universal slice map property if
and only if G is exact and the space C has the universal slice map property if and only if G has
the ITAP.

Theorem 4.18. Let G be a discrete group. Then (C∗

u|G|)G ⊆ I(C∗

λ(G)).

(cid:3)

Proof. We only sketch the proof.
Since l∞(G) is G-injective, we see that F (C, G) ∼= F (C, l∞(G) ⋊r G) ∼= (C∗
u|G|)G by Lemma 4.15
and Example 4.9. On the other hand, for any S we have S ⋊r G ⊆ F (S, G) ⊆ IG(S) ⋊r G ⊆
I(S ⋊r G).
