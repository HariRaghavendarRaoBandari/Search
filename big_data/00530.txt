Maximal Hypersurfaces in Spacetimes with

Translational Symmetry

Andrew Bulawa

March 3, 2016

Abstract

We consider four-dimensional vacuum spacetimes which admit a
free isometric spacelike R action. Taking a quotient with respect to the
R action produces a three-dimensional quotient spacetime (M, g). We
establish several results regarding maximal hypersurfaces (spacelike
hypersurfaces of zero mean curvature) in quotient spacetimes. First,
we show that complete noncompact maximal hypersurfaces must ei-
ther be ﬂat cylinders S 1 × R or conformal to the Euclidean plane R2.
Second, we establish a positive mass theorem for certain maximal hy-
persurfaces, referring to a deﬁnition of mass formulated in [3]. Finally,
while it is meaningful to use a bounded lapse when adopting the max-
imal hypersurface gauge condition in the four-dimensional (asymptot-
ically ﬂat) setting, it is shown here that nontrivial quotient spacetimes
admit the maximal hypersurface gauge only with an unbounded lapse.

Introduction

Consider a four-dimensional manifold ˆM with smooth Lorentzian metric
ˆg of signature (−, +, +, +). Suppose ( ˆM , ˆg) has a smooth isometric R action
whose orbits are spacelike curves. Taking a quotient with respect to the R
action gives a smooth three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold (M, g). It is
shown in [10] that the vacuum Einstein equations ˆRic = 0 on ( ˆM , ˆg) are
equivalent to the following system intrinsic to (M, g).

eψ is the length of the Killing vectorﬁeld corresponding to the R action
and ω is the twist one-form characterizing the integrability of the horizontal
distribution of the bundle ˆM → M (see Section 2). D denotes the covariant
derivative given by g, ✷gψ denotes the g-trace of the Hessian Ddψ, and h , i
denotes the inner product g induces on one-forms. We call any smooth three-
dimensional Lorentzian manifold (M, g) satisfying (1) a quotient vacuum
spacetime.

Quotient vacuum spacetimes of the form Σ × R with each hypersurface
Σt = Σ × {t} spacelike and compact have been analyzed in [6, 7]. Less
attention has been given to the setting where the foliating hypersurfaces Σt
are noncompact. A Hamiltonian framework for the compact case in [14] was
adapted for the noncompact setting in [3] where a positive mass theorem was
established (see also [4]). Those results were carried further in [16] where a
reduced Hamiltonian description was sought by imposing the maximal hy-
persurface gauge condition. Nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime, in
the context of quotient vacuum spacetimes, has been recently established
in [12]. While that result was achieved using generalized wave coordinates
rather than the maximal hypersurface gauge, and therefore diﬀers in many
ways from the results here, it is worth mentioning. The focus of this paper
is to explore the maximal hypersurface condition without the restrictions of
asymptotic ﬂatness and without other topological and geometric assump-
tions imposed in [3] and [16].

Let (M, g) be a smooth quotient vacuum spacetime corresponding to
a smooth four-dimensional vacuum spacetime ( ˆM , ˆg), and suppose that Σ
is a noncompact orientable spacelike hypersurface of (M, g). Assume Σ is
geodesically complete with respect to the hypersurface metric h induced by
g. The ﬁrst main result of this paper, Theorem 1.1, addresses the admissible
topologies and geometries of a hypersurface that is maximal, i.e., a hyper-
surface whose mean curvature is everywhere zero. We take maximality with
respect to ˆg to mean maximality of the preimage ˆΣ = π−1(Σ) under the
quotient map π : ˆM → M corresponding to the R action.

Theorem 1.1. If Σ is maximal with respect to ˆg, g, or the conformally
rescaled metric ˜g = e2ψg, then one of the following two statements holds:

• (Σ, h) is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean plane.

• (Σ, h) is a cylinder S1 × R with ﬂat metric.

Theorem 1.1 shows that assumptions made on the topology and geometry
of Σ in [16] are in fact consequences of the maximal hypersurface gauge
condition imposed there.

The next result of this paper parallels the positive mass theorems es-
tablished in [3] and [4]. An analogue of the ADM mass for quotient vac-
uum spacetimes is formulated in [3]. Then a positive mass theorem for the
proposed mass, β, is established: β ≥ 0 with equality if and only if the
hypersurface Σ together with its metric and second fundamental form com-
prises initial data for Minkowski spacetime. The authors ﬁnd it necessary
to require that β ≤ 2 to ensure that the Hamiltonian framework remains
well deﬁned. They note that this upper bound contrasts the behavior of
the ADM mass in four-dimensional spacetimes which do not admit a free
spacelike R action.

The deﬁnition of β in [3] relies on an asymptotic ﬂatness assumption on
Σ. In Section 3 we deﬁne β for maximal hypersurfaces in a way which does
not require asymptotic ﬂatness but that reduces to the deﬁnition in [3] when
asymptotic ﬂatness is assumed. Our deﬁnition is analogous to the quantity
θ0 in [4] where cylindrical symmetry is assumed. Let ˆh and ˆk denote the
metric and second fundamental form, respectively, that ˆg induces on the
hypersurface ˆΣ = π−1(Σ). We prove the following.

Theorem 1.2. Suppose that ˆΣ is maximal with respect to ˆg. Then

0 ≤ β ≤ 2,

and β = 0 if and only if ˆh is ﬂat and ˆk is identically zero.

It does not appear to be as straightforward to establish this theorem
when Σ is maximal only with respect to g or ˜g. These situations are left
unanswered in this paper.

The ﬁnal result of this paper concerns the maximal hypersurface gauge
condition on quotient vacuum spacetimes. That is, one assumes M = Σ ×
R with each Σt = Σ × {t} a maximal spacelike hypersurface. The lapse
g)−1/2, where t is projection Σ × R → R onto
function is given by u = (−|dt|2
the R-factor. For asymptotically ﬂat four-dimensional spacetimes which
do not exhibit a spacelike R action, it is meaningful to consider foliations
with a lapse which asymptotically approaches 1 at inﬁnity on each foliating
hypersurface. Indeed, this is how one derives expressions for ADM mass and
momentum. Theorem 1.3 illustrates that such asymptotics on the lapse are
incompatible with the maximal hypersurface gauge in nontrivial quotient
spacetimes. This was pointed out in [16], but with an asymptotic ﬂatness
assumption.

Theorem 1.3. Suppose ( ˆM , ˆg) gives rise to a quotient vacuum spacetime
(Σ × R, g) on which ω vanishes identically. Suppose each Σt = Σ × {t} is

3

a maximal hypersurface that is noncompact, orientable, and complete with
respect to the hypersurface metric induced by g. If, on each Σt, the lapse is
bounded above and ψ is bounded above and below, then ˆg is ﬂat.

2 The Quotient Structure

Let (M, g) be a quotient vacuum spacetime arising from a smooth vac-
uum spacetime ( ˆM , ˆg), as above. Throughout the paper we assume Σ ⊂ M
is a smooth orientable spacelike hypersurface with induced Riemannian met-
ric h and corresponding connection ∇. On Σ the tangent space T M splits
as T Σ ⊕ T Σ⊥, where T Σ⊥ denotes the space of tangent vectors normal to
Σ. We have the second fundamental form k : T Σ → T Σ given by

k(Y ) = −DY ν,

where ν is a unit length section of T Σ⊥.

Σ is the quotient, with respect to the R action, of a spacelike hypersurface
ˆΣ ⊂ ˆM having metric ˆh and second fundamental form ˆk. The situation is
summarized by the following diagram in which horizontal arrows denote
embeddings and πM and πΣ denote the quotient maps corresponding to the
R action:

( ˆΣ, ˆh, ˆk) −−−−→ ( ˆM , ˆg)

πΣy

(Σ, h, k) −−−−→ (M, g)

πMy

Σk.

ˆk is deﬁned so that it equals the pullback π∗

ψ and the twist one-form ω

Let ξ denote the one-form dual to the Killing vector ﬁeld X on ˆM corre-
sponding to the R action. Deﬁne ˆω = ∗ (ξ ∧ dξ), where ∗ denotes the Hodge
star operator. ˆω vanishes identically on ˆM if and only if X is hypersurface
orthogonal or, equivalently, the horizontal distribution of the R bundle ˆM
is integrable (see [17]). It is easily veriﬁed that ˆω(X) and the Lie derivative
LX ˆω are identically zero. Therefore ˆω decends to a one-form ω, called the
twist one-form, on M . Quotient spacetimes on which ω vanishes identically
are called polarized in the literature. We let ψ denote the log of the length
of the Killing vectorﬁeld X:

e2ψ = ˆg(X, X)

Relating the Geometry of ˆΣ and Σ

It will be useful to establish relationships between quantities in the total
space and quantities in the quotient. The mean curvature τ of Σ and the
square norm of k are given by

τ = tr hk

and

|k|2

h = tr h(k ◦ k),

and analogous quantities for ˆΣ are given by

ˆτ = tr ˆh

ˆk

and

|ˆk|2
ˆh

= tr ˆh(ˆk ◦ ˆk).

where tr h and tr ˆh denote traces with respect to the indicated metrics.

ˆτ and |ˆk|2 are invariant with respect to the R action, so they descend
to functions on Σ, and we will view them as such. In fact, any scalar on
ˆΣ determined by ˆg or ˆh is invariant with respect to the R action and will
descend to a scalar on Σ. We shall therefore view all scalars on ˆΣ in this
paper as scalars on Σ.

The following relationships are established in [8].

The Conformally Rescaled Geometry

We will also consider the conformally rescaled metrics ˜g on M and ˜h on

Σ given by

˜g = e2ψg

and ˜h = e2ψh.

There are two reasons for considering this conformal rescaling. First, the
scalar curvature ˜s given by ˜h is always nonegative, placing the geometry of
the surface (Σ, ˜h) in a signiﬁcantly more manageable class. Secondly, exam-
ples of quotient spacetimes such as Einstein-Rosen waves (see, for example,
[2, 15]) simplify considerably when viewed in this conformally rescaled set-
ting. We point out, however, that geodesic completeness of Σ with respect
to ˜h is not guaranteed.

The Ricci curvature ˜Ric corresponding to ˜g satisﬁes

˜Ric = 2dψ ⊗ dψ +

e−4ψω ⊗ ω.

(4)

This follows from (1) and standard formulas regarding conformal rescalings.

5

The metric ˜g induces on Σ the second fundamental form ˜k and the mean

curvature

˜τ = tr ˜h

˜k,

where throughout the paper the convention is used that a tilde ˜ or a sub-
script ˜g indicates that the marked quantity is deﬁned with respect to the
conformal metric ˜g. It is straightforward to derive the following relations:

˜k = eψ(k − dψ(ν) · IdT Σ)

˜τ = e−ψ(τ − 2dψ(ν)),

(5)

(6)

where IdT Σ : T Σ → T Σ denotes the identity map.

3 Topology and Geometry of Maximal Hypersur-

faces

In this section we prove Theorem 1.1, but we begin with some prelim-
inary steps. A spacelike hypersurface is said to be maximal
if its mean
curvature is identically zero. We have discussed three mean curvatures, ˆτ ,
τ , and ˜τ , with respect to which the deﬁnition of maximality could refer. We
will say that Σ is maximal if any one of these functions vanishes identically
on Σ. When it is necessary to be more speciﬁc, we will specify that Σ is
maximal with respect to ˆg, g, or ˜g accordingly. We will assume for the
remainder of the paper that Σ is noncompact, orientable, and geodesically
complete with respect to h.

It will be useful for us to relate the scalar curvatures between the total
space and the quotient, and additionally, to know that (Σ, ˆh) has nonnega-
tive scalar curvature when Σ is a maximal hypersurface.

Lemma 3.1. Let ˆs and s denote the scalar curvatures corresponding to ˆh
and h, respectively. Then

s = ˆs + 2∆hψ + 2|∇ψ|2

h +

e−4ψω(ν)2,

where ∆h = trh ∇2 denotes the Laplacian on Σ. Furthermore, if Σ is maxi-
mal, then ˆs ≥ 0.

where the ﬁrst and third lines follow from the Gauss-Codazzi equations
and the last equation is a consequence of (1) and the fact that ✷gψ =
∆hψ − Ddψ(ν, ν) + τ · dψ(ν). The ﬁrst and second lines show that ˆs ≥ 0
when ˆτ = 0 or τ = 0.

The Gauss-Codazzi equations for the conformally rescaled metric ˜g give

rise to

˜s = ˜R + 2 ˜Ric(˜ν, ˜ν) + |˜k|2

˜h − ˜τ 2

Now use the conformal relation e2ψ ˜s = s − 2∆hψ and the last line of the
previous calculation to see that ˆs ≥ 0 when ˜τ = 0.

Now that we know our maximal hypersurfaces have nonnegative curva-
ture, we can make use of the following result. Even though the isometry
group it refers to is S1, the result still applies. All we have to do is consider
a new total space ˆM in which the R ﬁbers have been compactiﬁed to S1
ﬁbers with length eψ.

Proposition 3.2 (Anderson [1]). Let N be an orientable complete Rieman-
nian 3-manifold having nonnegative scalar curvature and admitting a free
isometric S1 action. Let V be the quotient space V = N/S1 and let λ(r)
denote the circumference of a geodesic disc of radius r centered at a ﬁxed
point in V . Then there exists a constant c such that

λ(r) ≤ c · r.

Anderson also shows that square norms of tensor quantities relating to
the geodesic curvature of the S1 ﬁbers and the obstruction to integrability of

7

h and ω(ν)2, are L1 functions on
the horizontal distribution, in our case |∇ψ|2
N/S1. Adapting Anderson’s proof, we can establish a similar result, Lemma
3.3, for maximal hypersurfaces of quotient vacuum spacetimes.

From here on we will assume all metric related quantities are determined
by h unless indicated otherwise. Choose any point in Σ and denote by D(r)
the disc of radius r centered at that point. Let a(r) denote the area of D(r)
and let λ(r) denote the length of the boundary ∂D(r).

Lemma 3.3. Suppose Σ ⊂ M is maximal. Deﬁne G by

G(r) =ZD(r)

ˆs + 2|∇ψ|2 +

e−4ψω(ν)2 dµ,

where dµ is the volume form on Σ given by h. Then G is bounded above by

where o(r) denotes a function satisfying limr → ∞ o(r)/r = 0.

Proof. First of all, we claim that

(cid:2)G′(z)λ(z)(cid:3)1/2 dz = o(r),

−ZD(r)

∆ψ dµ ≤(cid:2)λ(r)G′(r)(cid:3)1/2 .

To see this, choose a small δ > 0. Given c > 1 we can ﬁnd a smooth function
η supported on D(r) which satisﬁes η = 1 on D(r − δ) and |∇η| ≤ c
δ .
Integrating by parts and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives

Taking the limit δ → 0 and then letting c → 1 establishes (8).

The Gauss-Bonnet theorem reads

ZD(r)

s dµ = 4πχ(r) − 2κ(r),

8

where χ(r) denotes the Euler characteristic of D(r) and κ(r) denotes the to-
tal geodesic curvature ∂D(r), including the sum of exterior angles of ∂D(r).
Putting the above two inequalities together with the expression for s given
in Lemma 3.1, we obtain

G(r) ≤ 4πχ(r) − 2λ′(r) + 2(cid:2)λ(r)G′(r)(cid:3)1/2 ,

where we have used the fact that λ′(r) ≤ κ(r) (see [11]), the derivative λ′(r)
interpreted in the sense of distributions.

(9)

If G ≤ 4π then the lemma is proved, so assume otherwise and choose r0

so that H(r) := G(r) − 4π > 0 for all r > r0. Then we have

where we have used the fact that χ ≤ 1 since D(r) is connected. We now
integrate each of the terms in the above inequality from r0 to some value
r1 > r0. Lemma 3.1 tells us that ˆs ≥ 0. So, for the leftmost term, we may
use Proposition 3.2 to obtain

Since this is true for all r1 > r0, we must have

A ≤ 2 [H(r0)]−1/2 .

r0 can be made arbitrarily large and A is independent of r0. It follows that
G is bounded above.

9

Since G is bounded, for any ǫ > 0, we can ﬁnd a number r0 so that

(G(r1) − G(r0))1/2 < ǫ for all r1 > r0. Therefore,

where c is the constant from Proposition 3.2. Since this argument holds for
all ǫ > 0, we have (7).

Finally, going back to (9), integrating both sides from 0 to r and using

(7) gives the upper bound G ≤ 4π.

We deﬁne the order of a complete Riemannian manifold N , just as in
[5]. Let V (r) denote the volume of a geodesic ball of radius r centered at
a ﬁxed point p in N . The order of N is deﬁned to be the smallest number
O(N ) such that

lim inf
r → ∞

(V (r)/rO(N )) < ∞.

With this, we can state the following Liouville type theorem.

Theorem 3.4 (Cheng-Yau [5]). If N is a complete Riemannian manifold
of order O(N ) ≤ 2, then N is parabolic, i.e., any subharmonic function that
is bounded above on N must be constant.

It is now straightforward to prove Theorem 1.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.1
First consider the case where Σ is simply connected. Lemma 3.1 and
Proposition 3.2 reveal that (Σ, h) has order ≤ 2, so Theorem 3.4 tells us
that (Σ, h) is parabolic. It follows from the unifomization theory of surfaces
(for example, see [9]) that (Σ, h) must be conformal to the Euclidean plane.
Next consider the case where Σ is not simply connected. Applying the
above argument to the universal cover of Σ shows that (Σ, h) is conformally
ﬂat. This leaves three possibilities for the topology of Σ: the plane, R2;
cylinder, S1 × R; or torus, S1 × S1. Since Σ is neither simply connected nor
compact, Σ must be topologically equivalent to the cylinder, S1 × R.

Deﬁne G(r) as in Lemma 3.3. The disc D(r) will fail to be simply
connected when r is suﬃciently large, say r > r0, so χ(r) ≤ 0. Therefore,
integrating both sides of (9) from r0 to r, we ﬁnd

Z r

r0

G ≤ 2λ(r0) + o(r).

Since G is a nonnegative nondecreasing function, the above inequality can
hold only if G is identically zero. This proves the second statement of the
theorem.

4 A Positive Mass Theorem

In [3] and [16] a Hamiltonian framework for quotient spacetimes is for-
mulated under the assumption that M = Σ × R. The authors assume that,
outside of a compact set, Σ has a single end Σ′ which is diﬀeomorphic to the
complement of a compact set in R2. Considering standard polar coordinates
(r, θ) on the slices Σ′×{t}, an asymptotic ﬂatness condition is imposed which
requires the metric h of a slice to have the asymptotic behavior h ∼ r−βδ,
where δ denotes the Euclidean metric and β is a constant. This deﬁnition
for asymptotic ﬂatness is motivated by examples involving point sources and
also special examples of quotient vacuum spacetimes called Einstein-Rosen
waves (see [2]). Note that r−βδ, for 0 ≤ β < 2, is the induced metric on a
cone in Euclidean space with opening angle θ0 = (2 − β)π.

By following the procedure which gives rise to ADM mass in the nonquo-
tient setting, the authors conclude that β is (proportional to) an analogue
of the ADM mass. They arrive at a positive energy theorem: β ≥ 0 with
equality if and only if (Σ, h, k) is initial data for Minkowski space. The
authors ﬁnd it necessary to require that β ≤ 2 to ensure that their Hamilto-
nian framework remains well deﬁned. The upper bound on β contrasts the
behavior of the ADM mass in the nonsymmetric setting.

We do not impose an asymptotic ﬂatness condition. Instead, we deﬁne

β as follows.

Deﬁnition 4.1.

β :=

1

2π ZΣ

ˆs + 2|∇ψ|2 +

1
2

e−4ψω(ν)2 dµ =

1

2π ZΣ

˜s d˜µ,

where dµ and d˜µ are the volume forms on Σ corresponding to h and ˜h,
respectively.

It is pointed out in [3] that the value of β deﬁned here is consistent
with the deﬁnition of mass described above, but here the integrand does not
match the Hamiltonian from which the deﬁnition in that work was derived.
We now prove Theorem 1.2 which plays the role of a positive energy
theorem and correlates well with the positive energy theorem derived in [4]
where cylindrical symmetry, asymptotic ﬂatness, and energy conditions are
assumed.

Proof of Theorem 1.2

Proof. Lemma 3.3 shows that β = G(∞)/2π ≤ 2. The inequality β ≥ 0
follows from Lemma 3.1 and the relation e2ψ ˜s = s − 2∆hψ. The “only

11

if” statement follows from the Gauss-Codazzi relations, which imply that
ˆs = |ˆk|2
when ˆτ = 0. The deﬁnition of β and Lemma 3.1 then show that
ˆh
ˆs = 0. To prove the “if” statement of the theorem, suppose ( ˆΣ, ˆh, ˆk) is
Minkowskian initial data. Then any Cauchy development ( ˆM , ˆg) of that
data must be a ﬂat spacetime, so dψ and ω must both vanish identically on
ˆM . Therefore β = 0 on Σ.

As pointed out in the introduction, it does not seem to be as straight-
forward to prove Theorem 1.2 for the cases τ = 0 or ˜τ = 0 on Σ. One can
deduce k = 0 or ˜k = 0, respectively, but |ˆk|2
will be a constant multiple of
ˆh
dψ(ν).

The fact that we can formulate a positive mass theorem for maximal
hypersurfaces with no condition of asymptotic ﬂatness leads one to ques-
tion what other similarities are shared by the maximality condition and the
asymptotic ﬂatness condition h ∼ r−βδ. This issue is especially pertinent if
one were to carry further the Hamiltonian analysis in [3] under the maximal
hypersurface gauge assumption, as is done in [16]. While similarities be-
tween the two conditions may be reassuring, similarities that are too strong
may suggest that the hypotheses may, when considered together, leave little
room for interesting results, or worse, are contradictory.

The following theorem indicates a similarity between the maximal hyper-
surface condition and the asymptotic ﬂatness condition. It states that when
Σ is maximal, the circumference λ(r) of a geodesic disc with suﬃciently
large radius r is no more than the circumference of a disc of equal radius in
the Euclidean plane, and Euclidean-sized circumferences occur only when
h is exactly the Euclidean metric. A better result would be something like
λ(r) ∼ (2 − β)πr, but while no counterexamples to this are known to this
author, neither is a proof.

Theorem 4.2. If Σ is maximal, then

λ(r) ≤ 2πr + o(r).

Moreover, as long as (Σ, h) is not a ﬂat cylinder, then one has equality if
and only if β = 0.

Proof. The proof follows immediately from integrating G as in the proof of
Theorem 1.2. This gives

2λ ≤ 4πr −Z r

0

G + o(r).

5 Foliations and the Lapse Function

In this section we prove Theorem 1.3. We assume that M is diﬀeo-
morphic to a product Σ × R and each slice Σt = Σ × {t} is a noncompact
maximal hypersurface, geodesically complete with respect to the metric h
induced by g. The lapse (or lapse function) on a hypersurface Σt is the
function u : Σt → R given by

where t is the function on M = Σ × R deﬁned by (p, x) → x.

u =(cid:0)−|dt|2

g(cid:1)−1/2

,

If each hypersurface is assumed to be maximal with respect to g, then

one ﬁnds (see, for example, [13]) that u satisﬁes

∆hu −(cid:0)|k|2

h + Ric(ν, ν)(cid:1) u = 0.

This equation is known as the lapse equation. Analogously, we have lapse
equations for the cases ˆτ = 0 and ˜τ = 0, respectively:

∆ˆhu − |ˆk|2
ˆh

u = 0;

∆˜hu −(cid:16)|˜k|2

˜h + ˜Ric(˜ν, ˜ν)(cid:17) u = 0,

where, in the ˆ the case, we deal with the pullbacks via πΣ of functions on
Σ.

The following Lemma will help us in dealing with solutions of the lapse

equation.

Lemma 5.1. Let N be a complete Riemannian manifold of order O(N ) ≤ 2.
Consider functions w : N → [0, ∞) and v : N → (c1, c2), where c1 and c2 are
positive constants. Then the only positive bounded solutions u : N → (0, ∞)
to the equation

∆u
u

=

∆v
v

+ w

are constant multiples of v. Note that the existence of a positive bounded
solution implies that w is the zero function.1

Proof. Let c0 be an upper bound for u/v and put γ = ln (c0 − u/v). Then
we have

∆γ + |∇γ|2 = −2h∇γ, ∇ ln vi − (c0e−γ − 1) · w ≤ −2h∇γ, ∇ ln vi

(10)

1If it happens that w is zero from the outset, then the boundedness requirement can

be removed from u. The same proof goes through with γ = ln(u/v).

We will integrate both sides of the inequality over a geodesic ball B = B(r) of
radius r, but ﬁrst we point out the following relation obtained by integration
by parts:

(ln v)n−1h∇γ, ∇ ln vi ≥Z∂B

(ln v)n∂rγ+ZB

(ln v)n|∇γ|2+2ZB

(ln v)nh∇γ, ∇ ln vi

Here ∂r denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to the outward unit normal
vector along ∂D, and these integrals are in terms of the volume form given
by the metric on N . The relation can be iterated to obtain

Letting N → ∞, this becomes

Now put this together with equation (10) to get

Put Γ(r) = RB(r) |∇γ|2 and let V (r) denote the volume of B(r). Then

we have

We will now show that this gives rise to a contradiction unless Γ is identically
zero by following the same arguments in the proof of Theorem 3.4. Suppose
Γ 6= 0. Then

By passing to a subsequence, we may arrange that ri/ri+1 < 1/2, which
gives a contradiction. Therefore Γ is identically zero. This completes the
proof.

Lemma 5.1 is the tool we need to prove Theorem 1.3 for the τ = 0 case.

(For the ˆτ = 0 or ˜τ = 0 cases, Theorem 3.4 will do.)
Proof of Theorem 1.3

First consider the case where each Σt is maximal with respect to g. Put
f = eψ. Then on any hypersurface Σ = Σt′, the lapse equation takes the
form

∆hu/u =(cid:0)Ric(ν, ν) + |k|2

h(cid:1) = ∆hf /f + |k|2

h,

so we can apply Lemma 5.1 with v = f and w = |k|2
h. We conclude that k
vanishes identically on Σ and that u is a scalar multiple of f . These facts
together with Theorem 1.1 imply that g can be written in the coordinate
form

g = −e2ψ(t,x,y)dt2 + e2α(x,y)(dx2 + dy2),

where dx2 +dy2 denotes the Euclidean metric on Σ = R2 or a trivial product
metric on Σ = R × S1.

From the Gauss-Codazzi relation ˆs = |ˆk|2
ˆh

− ˆτ 2 and the relations (2) and

(3), we see that ˆs = 0. Therefore, Lemma 3.1 shows that

∆hψ + |∇ψ|2

h = s/2 = −∆hα.

(11)

Diﬀerentiate both sides with respect to t and deﬁne ˙ψ := ∂
∂t ψ. We obtain
h = 0; equivalently, e ˙ψ is harmonic. Thus ˙ψ must be constant
∆h ˙ψ + |∇ ˙ψ|2
on each Σt. Now, turning to the second of the symmetry reduced vacuum
equations (1), we see that

e−2ψ ¨ψ = |∇ψ|2

h − ∆hα.

Since ˙ψ is constant on Σt, diﬀerentiating both sides with respect to t gives
...
ψ − 2 ¨ψ ˙ψ = 0. Then ψ must have the form

ψ = A ln(cos(at + b)) + Bt + C,

15

where A, a, b, B, C are constants with respect to t. We will now argue that
these must be constants in (x, y) as well.

Suppose A = 0. Then B = ˙ψ, so B is constant in (x, y). Additionally, a
coordinate computation (using Mathematica [18]) shows that 0 = ˆRictt =
− 1

2 ∆he2C . For ψ to be bounded, C must be constant in (x, y).
Next suppose A 6= 0. The ODE

...
ψ − 2 ¨ψ ˙ψ = 0 demands that B = 0 in
...
this case. Now, ¨ψ and
ψ must be constant on each Σt for the same reason
...
˙ψ was. A comparison of the expressions for ˙ψ, ¨ψ, and
ψ at t = 0 reveals
that A, a, and b must each be constant in (x, y). Then the same argument
as above shows that C is constant in (x, y) as well. Moreover, a coordinate
computation shows that 0 = ˆRictt = Aa2 sec2(at + b). Therefore, a = 0, so
ψ = C. We ﬁnd that the most general form for ψ is

ψ = Bt + C,

where B and C are constants on M .

Finally, returning to equation (11), we see that α must be a linear func-
tion of x and y. It follows that the nontriviality of α can be accommodated
for by a mindful choice of the coordinate functions x and y, so we will
assume, without loss of generality, that α is identically zero. Thus we have

ˆg = −dt2 + e2(Bt+C)dz2 + dx2 + dy2.

The coordinate change ˜t = t cosh z and ˜z = t sinh z puts ˆg in the Minkowskian
form

ˆg = −d˜t2 + d˜z2 + dx2 + dy2.

Next consider case in which each Σt is maximal with respect to ˆg. The

lapse equation reads

∆ˆhu = |ˆk|2
ˆh

u.

Since, for each t, ˆΣt is assumed to be the pullback π−1
M (Σt), the function u
must be invariant with respect to the R action on ˆΣt. Consider the three-
manifold obtained by compactifying the R ﬁbers of the bundle ˆΣt → Σt so
that they become S1 ﬁbers (of length eψ). There will be nothing lost in
assuming ( ˆΣ, ˆh) has this form. Then an upper bound on ψ guarantees that
( ˆΣt, ˆh) has order O( ˆΣt) ≤ 2. We may apply Theorem 3.4 (or Lemma 5.1
with v ≡ 1) to conclude that |ˆk|2 is identically zero and u is constant on ˆΣt.
Equation (2) shows that k vanishes identically on Σt. Therefore the metric
ˆg has the coordinate representation

ˆg = −dt2 + e2ψdz2 + e2α(dx2 + dy2),

16

where dx2 +dy2 denotes the Euclidean metric on Σ = R2 or a trivial product
metric on Σ = R × S1.

A coordinate computation gives the following.

ˆRictt = ¨ψ + ˙ψ2

ˆRicxx + ˆRicyy = −2(αxx + αyy) − (ψxx + ψyy) − (ψ2

ˆRiczz = e2ψ( ¨ψ + ˙ψ2) − e2ψ−2α(ψxx + ψyy + ψ2

x + ψ2
y)
x + ψ2
y)

From ˆRic = 0, we ﬁnd that ¨ψ+ ˙ψ2, ∆α, and ∆ψ+|∇ψ|2 all vanish identically
on each Σt. It follows that, with respect to (x, y), ψ is constant and α is
linear. Also, ψ = ln(t + a) + b for some constants a and b. Nonzero values
of a and b can be absorbed into the t and z coordinates, respectively, and
the nontriviality of α can be accommodated by the coordinates x and y, so
we may assume a = b = α = 0. Consequently, we have

ˆg = −dt2 + t2dz2 + dx2 + dy2,

which is Minkowskian, as above.

Finally consider the case where Σt is maximal with respect to ˜g. Equa-

tion (4) shows that the lapse equation reads

∆˜hu =(cid:16)|˜k|2

˜h + 2dψ(˜ν)2(cid:17) u.

Theorem 3.4 (or Lemma 5.1 with v ≡ 1) shows that u is constant on Σ, and
both |˜k|2
and dψ(˜ν)2 vanish identically on Σ. From equation (5) we see that
˜h
k is identically zero on Σ. The same arguments of the previous case lead us
to the conclusion of the theorem.
