Abstract

A known feature of electrically charged Reissner-Nordstr¨om-anti-de Sitter planar black holes is that
they can become unstable when considered as solutions of Einstein–Yang-Mills theory. The mechanism
for this is that the linearized Yang-Mills equations in the background of the Reissner-Nordstr¨om (RN)
black holes possess a normalizable zero mode, resulting in non-Abelian (nA) magnetic clouds near the
horizon. In this work we show that the same pattern may occur also for asymptotically ﬂat RN black
holes. Diﬀerent from the anti-de Sitter case, in the Minkowskian background the prerequisite for the
existence of the nA clouds is i) a large enough gauge group and ii) the presence of some extra interaction
terms in the matter Lagrangian. To illustrate this mechanism we present two speciﬁc examples, one in
four and the other in ﬁve dimensional asymptotically ﬂat spacetime. In the ﬁrst case, we augment the
usual SU (3) Yang-Mills Lagrangian with higher order (quartic) curvature term, while for the second one
we add the Chern-Simons density to the SO(6) Yang-Mills system. In both cases, an Abelian gauge
symmetry is spontaneously broken near a RN black hole horizon with the appearance of a condensate
of nA gauge ﬁelds. In addition to these two examples, we review the corresponding picture for anti-de
Sitter black holes. All these solutions are studied both analytically and numerically, existence proofs
being provided for nA clouds in the background of RN black holes. The proofs use shooting techniques
which are suggested by and in turn oﬀer insights for our numerical methods. They indicate that, for
a black hole of given mass, appropriate electric charge values are required to ensure the existence of
solutions interpolating desired boundary behavior at the horizons and spatial inﬁnity.

Introduction

The branching oﬀ of a family of solutions of a model into a new family of solutions at the onset of an
instability is a recurrent situation in physics. Starting with vacuum Einstein theory of gravity, an earlier
example is the Gregory-Laﬂamme instability [1] of black strings, which branch oﬀ to a family of nonuniform
string solutions at the onset of the instability [2]. A more recent example is the bumpy black holes (BHs),
which branch oﬀ the family of Myers-Perry vacuum BHs in d ≥ 6 spacetime dimensions [3], [4].
The same pattern occurs, however, for some ﬁeld theory models in a ﬂat spacetime background, the best
known example being perhaps the bisphalerons in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model of particle
physics [5], [6]. As expected, even more complicated solutions are found when considering gravitating matter
ﬁelds, with new features introduced by the possible existence of an event horizon. A recent example in this
direction is found for a complex massive scalar ﬁeld in the background of a Kerr BH. As discussed in [7], [8],
[9], the Klein-Gordon equation possesses bound state solutions (i.e. scalar clouds) around Kerr BHs. This
leads to the existence of a family of hairy BHs which branch oﬀ from the Kerr metric at the threshold of

1

the superradiant instability [8] (the existence of these scalar clouds at the nonlinear level has been proven
recently in [10]).

An important example which has recently received a considerable amount of interest, concerns the insta-
bility of the (electrically charged) Reissner-Nordstr¨om (RN) BH with a negative cosmological constant when
considered as a solution of the gravitating U (1)-gauged complex scalar ﬁeld theory [12], or of the Einstein–
Yang-Mills (EYM) theory [13]. In both cases, the branching towards a set of solutions in the more general
theory occurs for a particular set of Reissner-Nordstr¨om-anti de Sitter (RNAdS) BHs which form a line in
the parameter space. The hairy BHs are the nonlinear realization of those marginally stable modes. This
has led to the discovery of a remarkable connection between condensed matter and gravitational physics, the
hairy black hole solutions in the aformentioned theories being interpreted as ”holographic superconductors”,
via the gauge/gravity duality [14].

The main purpose of the present work is to show that the mechanism resulting in the spontaneous
breaking of an Abelian gauge symmetry near a black hole horizon, with the appearance of a condensate of
magnetic non-Abelian (nA) gauge ﬁeld, also occurs for gravitating nA ﬁelds in the absence of a cosmological
constant 1. Following the terminology for scalar ﬁelds, [7], [8], [9], these conﬁgurations with inﬁnitesimally
small magnetic ﬁelds are dubbed here non-Abelian clouds. Moreover, the corresponding bifurcating Reissner-
Nordstr¨om (RN) BHs will correspond to an existence line in the parameter space of solutions.

There is, however, a price to be paid in this case. Firstly, the gauge group must be larger than SO(d− 1)
(with d the spacetime dimension), and second, a suitable YM additional interaction term, with its corre-
sponding dimensional constant, must be employed. There are two candidates for this, the nonlinear densities
constructed from the nA ﬁelds and connections, namely i) as many as allowed higher-order curvature terms
in the given dimension, and ii) the allowed Chern-Simons (CS) density in that (odd) dimension.

For economy of presentation, we have chosen to demonstrate this eﬀect for two typical examples, in four
and ﬁve spacetime dimensions respectively. In the d = 4 case, we do not have the option of employing a
CS term, and the only higher order curvature term available there is the quartic kinetic YM term F 4 =
Tr{FµνρσF µνρσ}. As for gauge group, we have chosen SU (3), which is the smallest group larger than SO(4)
or SU (2). In ﬁve dimensions however, where we have available the CS density, we have eschewed the use
of the F 4 form for simplicity, and have chosen to employ the CS term, for diversity. In that case, we have
chosen to work with the gauge group SO(6) for convenience.

With these two examples, we aim to illustrate this mechanism for generic cases. Let us also mention that
our study uses a combination of analytical and numerical methods, which is enough for most purposes. In
particular, we have given analytic proofs of existence in addition to numerical constructions.

The methods of proofs are based on shooting arguments utilizing the black hole electric charge as shooting
parameter which gives rise to the boundary slope of the gauge ﬁeld proﬁle function at the horizon. In order
to obtain correct values of the charge, two steps of shooting processes are conducted. These methods are
hinted by and useful to the numerical approaches employed in this study.

Our work is organized as follows. Before considering the case of main interest of solutions in a Minkowski
spacetime background, we start in Section 2 by reviewing the mechanism unveiled in [13] for the occurrence
of nA clouds in the gravitating SU (2) YM system with a negative cosmological constant.
In Sections 3
and 4, we discuss two speciﬁc examples for the instability of asymptotically ﬂat RN BH with nA ﬁelds, in
four and ﬁve dimensions. In the ﬁrst case, one supplements the usual Yang-Mills Lagrangian with higher
order curvature terms of the gauge ﬁeld, while for the latter one considers the Yang-Mills–Chern-Simons
theory. The numerical results there are underpinned by rigorous existence proofs for the solutions of the
corresponding linearized (generalized) Yang-Mills equations. We end with Section 5, where the results are
summarised and discussed. The Appendix contains essentially the equations for the full non-linear systems
discussed in Sections 2-4, put, however, in a more general context.

1Note that the (asymptotically ﬂat, magnetically charged) RN BH is known to be unstable when viewed as a solution of the

Einstein–Yang-Mills–Higgs theory [11].

2.2 The parameter dependence of solutions

The above equation does not seem to possess a closed form solution. One can construct, however, approx-
imate solutions valid for r → rH and r → ∞, respectively. In the vicinity of the event horizon, the regular
solution has

In what follows we investigate the existence of a smooth solution connecting these asymptotics. Since
(6) is linear and homogeneous, we may set b = 1 without loss of generality and look for a solution satisfying
W (∞) = 0. For this purpose, we rewrite N (r) as

N (r) =

and locate rH ﬁrst. It is seen that the only root of f ′(r) is r0 = 2−

(9)

If Q = Q0, N (r) will have a double root at r = r0; if Q > Q0, N (r) will have two positive simple roots
which both depend on Q and may be denoted as r1(Q) and r2(Q) with r1(Q) < r2(Q). Thus in our notation
rH = r2(Q). Since f (r) > −2M r + Q2, we have

Q2
2M

< r1(Q) < r2(Q) = rH (Q).

Suggested by the asymptotic expression (7), we are to obtain a positive solution of (6) subject to the

boundary condition

following from (7), (8). With this, we may begin by integrating (6) to represent the unique local solution
with the initial condition W (rH ) = 1, W ′(rH ) = 0 as

The parameter dependence of the solution is demonstrated in (11) and (12) which allows us to obtain desired
solution proﬁles by parameter adjustment.

2.3 The numerical results

In practice, the solution interpolating between the asymptotics (7), (8) is found numerically, a typical proﬁle
being shown in Figure 1. Note that we restrict here to conﬁgurations with W (r) everywhere positive;
however, there are also excited solutions in which W (r) has nodes [13].

The results of the numerical integration are shown in Figure 2, where we exhibit the existence line in the
(M, Q)-parameter space of RNAdS solutions (note that there we set L = 1). One can see that, given a value
of the electric charge Q, the (nodeless) solution of (6) is found for a critical RNAdS BH only.

As discussed in [13], when taking into account the backreaction at the nonlinear level, this results in the
occurrence of a branch of EYM hairy black hole solutions which bifurcate from the RNAdS conﬁgurations
precisely at the existence line. Moreover, the solutions with a nonzero magnetic potential are thermodynam-
ically favoured over the magnetically neutral ones (i.e. they maximize the entropy for given M, Q).

holes with Minkowski spacetime asymptotics

3.1 The setting

It is worth inquiring to which extent the features unveiled above are speciﬁc to AdS spacetime, and whether
they can be recovered (at least to some extent) also by asymptotically ﬂat conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst obser-
vation is that in this case the BHs necessarily possess a spherical horizon topology [17], [18]. Second, for
Λ = 0, the static conﬁgurations with a gauge group SU (2) and a non-trivial magnetic potential necessarily
have At ≡ 0 as found by a number of classic no go “baldness” theorems [19]. This immediately excludes the
existence of SU (2) clouds around electrically charged Reissner-Nordstr¨om black holes.
One may hope that the situation changes when considering instead a larger gauge group. The minimal
gauge group for which the superposition of a Coulomb ﬁeld and a non-Abelian hair is not forbidden by the

5

“baldness” theorems is SU (3). In this case, a spherically symmetric Ansatz for the gauge ﬁeld reads2 [20]

A = w(r)T1dθ + (w(r)T2 sin θ + cos θT3) dϕ + V (r)T8dt,

(13)

where Ti are the standard generators of the SU (3) Lie algebra. The electrically charged RN BH remains a
solution of the EYM-SU(3) model, with a line element

(14)

(15)

rH = M +pM 2 − Q2 > 0 is an input parameter – the outer event horizon (with N (rH ) = 0).

Apart from that, there are also genuinely nA solutions which possess a nontrivial magnetic potential w(r).
As discussed in [20], these conﬁgurations can be thought of as nonlinear superpositions of the (electric) RN
and the (purely magnetic) SU(2) black holes [21]. In particular, they do not emerge as perturbations of the
electrically charged BHs, the overall picture being very diﬀerent from that in the AdS case.

These results are found for a usual YM action which contains the usual quadratic term Fµν F µν only.
However, as discussed in [22], the situation changes when the nA action is augmented with higher order
curvature terms of the gauge ﬁeld. In the simplest case the Lagrangian for the SU(3) ﬁelds reads

L = −

1
2

Tr{Fµν F µν} + Ls, with Ls =

3τ
2

Trn(Fµν ˜F µν )2o ,

(16)

where a tilde denotes the Hodge dual and τ is an input parameter of the theory. One can see that Ls
features only the second power of any “velocity ﬁeld” and is a causal density just like the Gauss-Bonnet
term in gravity [24] or the Skyrme [25] term of the O(4) sigma model. Also, Ls can be viewed as the second
member of the YM hierarchy [26], providing a natural generalization of the usual YM model. Such terms
were extensively considered in the literature for Abelian solutions; however, the nA case is considerably less
studied.

The equations of motion for a spherically symmetric system are displayed in Appendix A2. An important
observation is that the (electrically charged) RN BH is still a solution of this model with the extra Ls-term.
We are interested in the conﬁgurations with w2(r) inﬁnitesimally close to 1, such that the magnetic part of
the nA ﬁeld is too small to back-react signiﬁcantly upon the geometry,

w(r) = −1 + ǫW (r),

(17)

in which case the geometry is still described by the metric functions in (14), sourced by a purely electric YM
ﬁeld.

Then the linearized YM equations in A2 imply that W (r) solves the equation

(N W ′)′ =

2W
r2 (1 −

).

3.2 The existence of solutions
We are interested in the smooth solutions of (18) with the following form as r → rH

W (r) = b + w1(r − rH ) + O(r − rH )2,

(18)

(19)

2Note that (13) corresponds in fact to an SU (2) × U (1) Ansatz, the magnetic and electric potential interacting only via the

spacetime geometry.

6

where

w1 =

2b(r4
r3
H (r2

H − 2Q2τ )
H − Q2)

,

with b 6= 0 an arbitrary parameter. Also, since the eq. (18) is linear, we set b = 1 without any loss of
generality. The corresponding expression for large r reads

W (r) =

J
r

3J(Q2 + r2

4rH

r2 + O(1/r3),

(20)

with J a constant.

The existence of a smooth solution interpolating between these asymptotics can be shown as follows.

First, we ﬁx the length scale of the problem by taking rH = 1, such that

N (r) = (cid:18)1 −

1

r(cid:19)(cid:18)1 −

Q2

r (cid:19) ,

0 < Q < 1,

r ≥ 1.

From (19), (20), the solutions of (18) are subject to the boundary condition

W (1) = 1, W (∞) = 0.

It is easy to see that (18) has a unique local solution satisfying the initial condition

For convenience, we denote such a solution as W (r; a) and deﬁne the set

W (1) = 1, W ′(1) = a,

a ∈ IR.

S+ = {a ∈ IR| W ′(r; a) = Wr(r; a) > 0 for some r > 1}.

It is clear that S+ is open. It is trivial that (0,∞) ⊂ S+.

We recast (18) into

(21)

(22)

(23)

So we may adjust Q in the interval (0, 1) to make a > 0 or a ∈ S+.

In order to have a solution with a < 0, we need to request

a = lim

W ′(r; a) =

which will be observed in the sequel.

We next consider the interval

r > 1.

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

From (24) we see that W ′ < 0 provided that r ∈ I0 and W stays non-negative for r ∈ I0. With this condition,
we have

(29)

which may be made positive by adjusting Q in the interval (26) suitably.

Similarly, we can ﬁnd a suitably such that W (r; a) < 0 for some r ∈ (1, r0). We set

A+ = {a| W (r; a) > 0 for all r ∈ I0},
A− = {a| W (r; a) < 0 for some r ∈ I0}.

Then A+ and A− are open sets which may be restricted to an open interval, say I, for Q satisfying the
condition (26). The connectedness of I implies A0 = I \ (A+ ∪ A−) 6= ∅.
It is clear that
r1 = r0 otherwise r1 would be an interior minimum of W over I0 resulting in W ′(r1; a) = 0, thus W ≡ 0 by
the uniqueness theorem of the initial value problem of ordinary diﬀerential equations, which contradicts the
initial condition W (1; a) = 1. Thus we have

Take a ∈ A0. Then W (r; a) ≥ 0 for all r ∈ I0 and W (r1; a) = 0 for some r1 ∈ I0.

W (r; a) > 0

for r ∈ [1, r0); W (r0; a) = 0.

Inserting (30) into (24), we obtain

W ′(r; a) < 0,

r ∈ I0.

We claim W ′(r; a) < 0 for all r > 1. In fact, for r near and above r0, we have from (24)

W ′(r; a) =

2Q2τ

ρ4 (cid:21) W (ρ; a)(cid:19) dρ,

which will continue to stay negative for all r > r0 since W becomes negative beyond r0.

Therefore, we have shown that the set

S− = {a ∈ IR | W ′(r; a) < 0 for all r > 1 and W (r; a) < 0 for some r > 1}

is not empty. This set is clearly open.

Using the connectedness of IR, we see that S0 = IR \ (S+ ∪ S−) 6= ∅. For a ∈ S0, we have

W ′(r; a) ≤ 0, W (r; a) ≥ 0,

r > 1.

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

Applying the uniqueness theorem of the initial value problem of ordinary diﬀerential equations again, we get
W > 0.

We claim W ′ < 0 for all r > 1. In fact, we have W ′(r; a) < 0 for r ∈ I0 since W (r; a) > 0 for r ∈ I0.

Assume otherwise that W ′ has at least one zero and set

Then r1 > r0 and

r1 = inf{W ′(r; a) = 0 | r > r0}.

With the properties of W stated in (35), we now establish the limit

In fact, if W∞ 6= 0, then

From (24) we see that

since N < 1 for r > r0. Integrating (40) leads to

W (r; a) < W (r2; a) − W∞ ln

r > r2,

so that W fails to stay positive when r is large enough. This contradiction shows that W∞ can only be zero.

In summary, we have established that the initial value problem consisting of (18) and (23) has a solution
W satisfying the boundary condition (22) when (26) is fulﬁlled and the initial slope parameter a is suitably
chosen in the range

a =

2(1 − 2Q2τ )
(1 − Q2)

< 0.

(41)

Moreover, W enjoys the properties stated in (35).

3.3 The numerical results

The solutions of (18) interpolating between the asymptotics (19) and (20) are again constructed numerically.
In our numerical approach, we ﬁx rH = 1 and τ = 1 as input parameters and look for nodeless solutions.
Then (18) becomes an eigenvalue problem in terms of Q. The corresponding value of Q is found by using a
(numerical) shooting procedure, being uniquelly ﬁxed under these assumptions.

The proﬁle of the solution for a typical RN background is shown in Figure 3. In Figure 4 we show the
existence line of solutions in the (M, Q)-parameter space. This corresponds to the critical RN solutions
which bifurcate into a branch of BHs with nA hair. The hairy solutions are found when promoting the nA
cloud to non-linear level and taking into account the backreaction [22].

grounds: d = 5

4.1 The setting

It is of interest to see if the pattern discussed in the previous two Sections occurs also in more than four
dimensions, d > 4. As discussed in [29], the higher dimensional (planar) RNAdS black holes are also unstable
when considered as solutions of EYM theory with a negative cosmological constant. This results as well in
the occurrence of a set of critical (embedded Abelian) BH solutions possessing nA clouds.

We expect that this is also the case for the solutions in a Minkowski spacetime background like that
discussed in Section 3.
Indeed, at least in d = 5 and d = 6 dimensions, this pattern repeats for the
Lagrangian (16) with gauge group SO(d + 1), the general setup being presented in Appendix A2. By solving
the linearized YM equation (A.12), we have veriﬁed that nA clouds around RN black holes exist in those cases.

10

The overall picture is similar to that discussed in the previous Section and it will be reported elsewhere [30].
Also, the existence proof given in the previous section can be adapted to the higher dimensional case.

In what follows, we shall not exercise the option of using higher-order YM terms, but rather will employ
a Chern-Simons (CS) term in the YM action (16) in lieux of the F (4)2 in (16) as the simpler, or less
nonlinear alternative 3. Moreover, this option has a good justiﬁcation, since a CS term appears in various
supersymmetric theories, the N = 8, D = 5 gauged supergravity model [31], [32] being perhaps the best
known case, due to its role in the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence.

In d = 5 dimensions, the CS Lagrangian reads

Ls = κǫI1 ···I6(cid:16)F I1I2 ∧ F I3I4 ∧ AI5I6 − F I1I2 ∧ AI3I4 ∧ AI5J ∧ AJI6

(42)

where AIJ are the SO(6) gauge ﬁelds, F IJ = dAIJ + AIK ∧ AKJ , and κ the CS coeﬃcient. The gauge ﬁelds
ansatz contains only two functions, a magnetic gauge potential w, and an U (1) electric one, V :

γij being the representation matrices of SO(4), and γ56 of the SO(2), subalgebras of SO(6). The Cartesian
coordinates xi are related to the spherical coordinates in (45) as in ﬂat space.

The CS term (42) is added to the usual EYM Lagrangian, the resulting equations being displayed in

Appendix A3. The electrically charged RN BH is a solution of this model, with

where M, Q are two parameters ﬁxing the mass and electric charge of BH, respectively. Also, the outer BH

horizon is located at r = rH = (M +pM 2 − 4Q2)/2 > 0, where N (rH ) = 0.

Restricting again to an inﬁnitesimally small magnetic ﬁeld, one takes again

with W (r) a solution of the equation (which results by linearizing the w-equation in (A.15))

4.2 The existence of solutions

We are interested in smooth solutions of the above equation which interpolate between the following boundary
values

W (rH ) = b, W (∞) = 0.

(48)

An approximate solution compatible with (48) can also be constructed; for r → rH one ﬁnds

3The Chern-Simons terms can be employed in all (higher) odd dimensions, but ﬁnite energy solutions exist only for La-
grangians in which the lowest order YM term F (2p)2 is of higher order than the p = 2 case in (16). Of course, the Reissner-
Nordstr¨om solutions in that case would be those of the higher order gravities studied in [23]. In that case one might also replace
the usual Einstein gravity by its higher order versions employed there.

So we ﬁrst study the properties of the local solution of (52) in I0 = [1, r0].

(56)

We note that W (r) > 0 when r > 1 and r is close to 1. Thus, as far as W stays non-negative and r ∈ I0,

we have W ′(r) < 0. Thus, in this interval, we have 0 ≤ W (r) < 1 and so

(58)

It is clear that when Q is close to − 1

4κ the right-hand side of (58) stays positive. This proves that the set

B+ = (cid:26)Q ∈ (cid:18)−1,−

where W solves the initial value problem

W (r) > 0 for all r ∈ I0(cid:27)

1

4κ(cid:19) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

W satisﬁes (47) and the initial condition W (1) = 1, W ′(1) = b(Q)

(59)

is nonempty. The continuous dependence of the solution to the initial condition and the parameters in the
diﬀerential equation then indicates that B+ is open.

Similarly, it may be shown that the set

B− = (cid:26)Q ∈ (cid:18)−1,−

W (r) < 0 for somel r ∈ I0(cid:27)

1

4κ(cid:19) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is nonempty, where W solves the initial value problem (59). To see this we may choose Q to be close to −1
which makes W to start with a suﬃciently negtive slope in view of (53) and drives W to the negative value
range quickly. Of course B− is also open.

By the connectedness of the interval (cid:0)−1,− 1
B0 = (cid:18)−1,−

4κ(cid:1) we see that
4κ(cid:19) \ (B+ ∪ B−) 6= ∅.

1

For Q ∈ B0, we see that W (r) ≥ 0 for all r ∈ I0. Since W ′(r) < 0 for r ∈ I0, we must have W (r0) = 0.
In summary, we have obtained some Q ∈ (cid:0)−1,− 1

4κ(cid:1) so that the solution of (59) satisﬁes

W (r) > 0 for r0 ∈ [1, r0); W (r0) = 0; W ′(r) < 0, r ∈ [1, r0].

(60)

Let W be a solution of (59) satisfying (60). Then W (r) < 0 for r > r0 but r is close to r0 since W (r0) = 0

and W ′(r0) < 0. For r > r0 we rewrite (52) as

W ′(r) =

1

+Z r

r0(cid:19) 1

ρ (cid:18)1 −

r2
0

ρ2(cid:19) W (ρ) dρ,

r > r0.

We see that W ′(r) for all r > r0, in the interval of existence, since W (r) < 0 beyond r0. In particular, we
have established that the set

Q− = (cid:26)Q ∈ (−1, 0] (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is not empty. This set is readily seen to be open.

To proceed further, we deﬁne

W ′(r) < 0 for all r > 1 and W (r) < 0 for some r > 1(cid:27)

Q+ = (cid:26)Q ∈ (−1, 0] (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

W ′(r) > 0 for some r > 1(cid:27) .

Then Q+ 6= ∅. In fact, we may formally rewrite the local solution of (47) in the form (52) and use the
L’Hopital’s rule to ﬁnd W ′(1) again as before.
In particular, for Q < 0 and close to Q = 0, we have
W ′(1) > 0. Thus W ′(r) > 0 for r near r = 1 and r > 1. It is obvious that Q+ is also open.

13

Now the connectedness of (−1, 0] shows that

Q0 = (−1, 0] \ (Q+ ∪ Q−) 6= ∅.

Take Q ∈ Q0. Then Q < 0. For such Q, let W be the corresponding solution of (59) where we no longer
require Q to be conﬁned within the interval(cid:0)−1,− 1
4κ(cid:1) but within (−1, 0). For such W , we have the properties

W ′(r) ≤ 0, W (r) ≥ 0,

r > 1.

(61)

It is clear that in fact W (r) > 0 for all r > 1. Indeed, if there is some r1 > 1 such that W (r1) = 0, then
W attains it interior minimum at r1 such that W ′(r1) = 0. Applying the uniqueness theorem of the initial
value problem of ordinary diﬀerential equations we derive W ≡ 0 which is false.
We claim W ′(r) < 0 for all r > 1. In fact since W (r) > 0 we have W ′(r) < 0 for r ∈ I0 in view of (52).
Assume otherwise that W ′(r1) = 0 at some r1 > r0 and that r1 is the left-most such point. Then (52) gives
us

(62)

since W (r) > 0. This is false. Therefore we arrive at the following slightly strengthened version of (61):

With the properties of W established, we see in particular that

W ′(r) < 0, W (r) > 0,

r > 1.

W∞ ≡ lim

r→∞

W (r)

exists and W∞[0, 1). We further claim W∞ = 0. Otherwise, if W∞ > 0, then we have

Inserting this into (52) we see that there are constants C0, C1, C2 > 0 such that

0 < W∞ < W (r) < 1,

r > 1.

W ′(r) >

(63)

(64)

where r2 > 1 is suﬃciently large. In particular, W ′(r) > 0 when r is large enough which is false again.

In summary, we have shown the existence of a solution W of (47) which enjoys the properties

W (1) = 1; W ′(r) < 0, W (r) > 0,

1 < r < ∞; W (∞) = 0,

(65)

provided that Q ∈ (−1, 0) is suitably chosen and κ stays in the interval ( 1

4.3 The numerical results

The smooth solution interpolating between (49) and (50) is constructed again by numerical integration. Not
completely unexpected, the picture here is similar to that found for the model in Section 3. In Figure 5 we
show the existence line found for κ = 0.6. The proﬁle of a typical solution of (47) is similar to that in Figure
3 and we shall not display here.

to extremal BHs (RN BHs exist above it (shaded region)). The non-Abelian clouds exists along the red line.

As discussed in [33], [34], these nA clouds may be continued past the point where they are an inﬁnites-
imally small perturbation of RN BHs. This results in a set of black holes with magnetic nA hair, which
possess also a ﬁnite mass and electric charge. Remarkably, some of these nA conﬁgurations are stable under
linear, spherically symmetric perturbations.

5 Conclusions

One of the most interesting developments in the physics of AdS spacetime was the discovery in 2008 by
Gubser of the p-wave “holographic superconductors”. The starting point there was the observation that
RNAdS BH becomes unstable when considered as a solution of the Einstein–Yang-Mills theory, with the
appearance of a magnetic nA cloud close to the horizon. This feature occurs for a particular set of RNAdS
conﬁgurations which form a line in the parameter space, the hairy BHs being the nonlinear realization of
those marginally stable solutions.

The main purpose of this work was to show that, despite the diﬀerent asymptotic structure of spacetime
and the diﬀerent horizon topology, the asymptotically ﬂat RN black holes can also become unstable in the
presence of nA gauge ﬁelds, with the occurrence of nA clouds around the horizon. We provided two examples
of this, for d = 4 and d = 5 spacetime dimensions, in Sections 3 and 4 respectively.

In contrast to the case of AdS background, where one ﬁnds EYM solutions supporting the electric
component of the nA SU (2) connection At in d = 4 spacetime, the existence of such nA hairy solutions in
the case of ﬂat background requires two crucial ingredients. The ﬁrst one is that the gauge group should be
large enough (at least SO(d + 1) for our models, with d the spacetime dimension). The second ingredient
is the presence of some nonlinear terms in the nA connection and curvature, of higher order than the usual
(quadratic) F 2 one. The higher order terms used here are variously, the (quartic) F 4 and the Chern-Simons
terms. In both these two (ﬂat background) cases, analytic proofs for the existence of the perturbed solutions
were given in addition to numerical construction.

The general mechanism appears to be the following:

in all cases, the RN BH remains a(n embedded
Abelian) solution of the full model. However, for some range of the parameters, the extra terms mentioned
above give a tachyonic mass for the vacuum perturbations of the nA magnetic ﬁelds around the Abelian
solutions, with the appearance of a nA condensate. Similar to the AdS case, this implies the occurrence of a
branch of fully nA BHs, which are generically thermodynamically favored over the Abelian conﬁgurations.
It would be interesting to further pursue the unveiled similarity of the Minkowskian case here with the
AdS case, and to investigate the possible relevance of these aspects in providing analogies to phenomena
observed in condensed matter physics.

for k = −1.

For any value of k, the metric (A.1) possesses the same amount of symmetries, since dθ2 + f 2
k (θ)dϕ2 is the
line element on a two-dimensional surface of constant curvature 2k. The spherically symmetric solutions
have k = 1, in which case one can ﬁnd both solitons and black hole solutions [35]; for k = 0,−1 one ﬁnds
only “topological” black holes (see [36] for recent results on such conﬁgurations).
The SU (2)-YM Ansatz compatible with the symmetries of the line-element (A.1) has been proposed in

[15], [16], and reads

One can easily see that k = 0 is special, since the RN black hole with a nonzero electric ﬁeld and a vanishing
magnetic ﬂux is a solution in that case only. For k = 1, the magnetic ﬁeld trivializes for w(r) = ±1. However,
from the w-equation, this is not consistent with keeping a nonzero electric potential V (r). Moreover, the
solutions with k = −1 do not possess a vacuum, since one cannot ﬁnd a real value of w(r) which gives a
vanishing magnetic ﬁeld (even for V (r) ≡ 0).

conveniently as

where {Fµν , Fρσ} denotes the anticommutator of Fµν and Fρσ, while the notation Fµ[ν Fρσ] implies the cyclic
symmetry on (ν, ρ, σ), i.e Fµν Fρσ + Fµρ Fσν + Fµσ Fνρ . This results in

Fµνρσ = {Fµ[ν , Fρσ]},

(A.7)

which is analogous to the corresponding expression for the Gauss-Bonnet term in gravity. Unlike the latter
however, (A.7) is not a total divergence and hence does not trivialize in d = 4 dimensions, as long as the
component A0 of the YM connection is supported, which is achieved by choosing a large enough gauge group.
In that case it can be expressed in the equivalent form displayed in eq. (16).

d−2 the metric on the (d − 2)-sphere.

In d−spacetime dimensions, the minimal gauge group allowing a spherically symmetric nA Ansatz con-
taining both electric and magnetic parts is SO(d + 1). In what follows, we shall restrict to a consistent
SO(d − 1) × SO(2) truncation of the general Ansatz, parametrised by two potentials, a magnetic one w(r)

Cartesian coordinates xi are related to the spherical coordinates in (A.8) as in ﬂat space. The matrices
γi used here symbolise the (d − 1)−dimensional Dirac gamma matrices Γi when d is odd, and the chiral

The equations for the SU (2)× U (1) (i.e. SO(3)× SO(2)) model introduced in Section 3 are found by taking
τ1 = 1, τ2 = τ , d = 4 in the above relations. Also, one can easily verify that the embedded Abelian RN BH

(with M , Q two constants ﬁxing the mass and electric charge) is a solution.

Again, an inﬁnitesimally small magnetic ﬁeld is turned on by taking w(r) = −1 + ǫW (r). To leading

For the gauge group SO(6), the corresponding spherically symmetric, time independent YM Ansatz is given
by (43), in terms of a magnetic potential w(r) and an electric one V (r). Then the equations of the model
