HARDY SPACES OF VECTOR-VALUED DIRICHLET SERIES

A. DEFANT AND A. PÉREZ

ABSTRACT. Given a Banach space X and 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, it is well known that
the two Hardy spaces Hp(T, X) (T the torus) and Hp(D, X) (D the disk) have
to be distinguished carefully. This motivates us to deﬁne and study two different
ann−s with
types of Hardy spaces Hp(X) and H+
coefﬁcients in X. We characterize them in terms of summing operators as well
as holomorphic functions in inﬁnitely many variables, and prove that they co-
incide whenever X has the analytic Radon-Nikodým Property. Consequences
are, among others, a vector-valued version of the Brother’s Riesz Theorem in
the inﬁnite-dimensional torus, and an answer to the question when H1(X ∗) is a
dual space.

p (X) of Dirichlet seriesPn

1. INTRODUCTION

Recent years have seen a remarkable growth of interest in certain functional

analytic aspects of the theory of ordinary Dirichlet seriesPn ann−s. We refer to

the survey [25] and the monograph [29], and highlight the articles [4] and [24].
The aim of the present paper is to study properties of Hardy spaces of vector-
valued Dirichlet series, this is, Dirichlet series with coefﬁcients in a (complex)
Banach space X. As a sort of by-product, we will see that our vector-valued point
of view even allows to obtain more information on scalar-valued Dirichlet series.
But before we explain more carefully what we intend to do, let us introduce some
preliminaries.

Bohr established a formal one-to-one correspondence between Dirichlet series
and formal power series in inﬁnitely many variables with coefﬁcients in C. This
correspondence in a straight forward way extends to the vector-valued situation.
Given a Banach space X, the map, to which we will refer as Bohr transform, is
formally deﬁned as

endowed with the norm that makes this identiﬁcation an onto isometry between
both spaces. It follows from this deﬁnition some features like the fact that if a
sequence of Dirichlet series (DN )N converges in Hp(X) to some D, then the se-
quence coefﬁcients an(DN ) converges to an(D) for each n ∈ N; or the denseness
of the set of all Dirichlet polynomials D = PN
n=1 ann−s, N ∈ N in Hp(X) for
1 ≤ p < +∞, as so do the set of trigonometric polynomials in Hp(TN, X). More-
over, the Hp(X)-norm of such Dirichlet polynomials D is given by the following
two intrinsic formulas (see e.g. [29]): For 1 ≤ p < ∞ we have

The Banach space Hp(TN, X) shares many features with the classical Hardy
space Hp(T, X) (deﬁned similarly) as we point out in section 2. Given 1 ≤ p <
∞, the Banach space Hp(D, X) consists of all holomorphic functions F : D → X
such that

Recall that for p = ∞ the Hardy space H∞(D, X) is the Banach space of all
bounded and holomorphic functions F : D → X together with the supremum
norm. It is well-known that Hp(D, X) contains Hp(T, X) isometrically by means
of the Poison Kernel K: given f ∈ Hp(T, X) the function
(3)

f (ω)K(ω, z) dω where K(ω, z) := |ω|2 − |z|2
|ω − z|2 ,

F (z) =ZT

belongs to Hp(D, X) and kFkHp(D,X) = kfkHp(T,X). In the scalar case this leads
to an onto isometry – however in the vector-valued case Hp(D, X) and Hp(T, X)
are in general different (see also section 5).
For each σ ∈ R denote

Cσ := {s ∈ C : Re (s) > σ} .

Following the previous philosophy we deﬁne D∞(X) as the space of all Dirichlet

series D =Pn ann−s with coefﬁcients an ∈ X which converge on the half space

C0 and deﬁne a bounded and (then automatically) holomorphic function D(s) on
that half-space. The next result of Bohr is fundamental for everything following
(details of its proof are given in Remark 3.4).

Theorem 1.1. Every Dirichlet seriesPn ann−s in a Banach space X which has

a limit function D(s) extending to a bounded and holomorphic functions on C0,
converges uniformly on all half spaces Cε where ε > 0 .

Based on this result it is quite simple to show that D∞(X) together with the

supremum norm

forms a Banach space. It is by now well-known that

kDkD∞(X) := sup

s∈C0 kD(s)kX

H∞(C) = D∞(C)

(see e.g. [24] or [29] ). However, in the case 1 ≤ p < ∞ a Dirichlet series
D ∈ Hp(C) in general only deﬁnes a holomorphic function on C1/2 (see e.g. [4]).
How to overcome this “gap” between 1 ≤ p < ∞ and p = ∞ at least partly?
We in a ﬁrst step consider for every Dirichlet series D = Pn ann−s with coefﬁ-
cients in X its translation by some z ∈ C:
Dz :=Xn

an
nz n−s .

And then in a second step, we deﬁne for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ the Banach space

H+
p (X)

of all Dirichlet series D in X such that Dε ∈ Hp(X) for each ε > 0 and moreover

kDkH+

p (X) := sup

and that the inclusion is even an isometry; indeed, if D ∈ D∞(X) and ε > 0, then
by Bohr’s fundamental Theorem 1.1 the sequence DN

converges to Dε uniformly on C0. But by (2) we have

Hence the Cauchy sequence (DN

It is a bit more challenging to show that even

and that for all 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ the following inclusions

Hp(X) ֒→ H+

hold true and are isometric (see Corollary 3.5 and Theorem 2.1). In the scalar
case we will see that even

Hp(C) ≡ H+

p (C) ,

In section 5 we prove that Hp(X) and H+

however in the vector-valued case it will turn out that this in general is not true
which motivates the following two questions:
Q1. For which Banach spaces X do we have that Hp(X) and H+
p (X) coincide?
p (X) coincide for every 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ if
and only if they coincide for some 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, which in turn is equivalent to the
fact that the Banach space X has the so-called analytic Radon-Nikodým Property,
see Theorem 5.4. The proof relies on a representation result given in Lemma 2.3,
and a theorem due to Dowling [23].
Q2.
“better-known” Banach space “bigger” than Hp(X)?
We deal with this question in section 4. The answer is inspired on results of
Blasco [7], [8]. As usual, we denote the space of all bounded and linear operators
between two Banach spaces E and X by L(E, X) endowed with the operator
norm k · k. The following notion (see [31, Chapter IV, Section §3], [7, Deﬁnition
1, p. 275]) is crucial for our purposes:

Can we, for an arbitrary Banach space X, identify H+

p (X) with some

An operator T ∈ L(E, X), where E is a Banach lattice, is said to be cone abso-
lutely summing if there is a constant C > 0 such that for every choice of ﬁnitely

many positive elements f1, . . . , fn ∈ E, we have that
nXi=1

kT fik ≤ C sup

nXi=1

ξ∗∈BE ∗

|ξ∗fi|

(here E∗ denotes the dual of E and BE ∗ its unit ball). We denote by Λ(E, X) the
space of all cone absolutely summing operators and endow it with the norm k·kΛ
which is the inﬁmum of all constants C > 0 satisfying (1). It turns out that this is
indeed a Banach space with k · k ≤ k · kΛ.

Denote by 1 ≤ p∗ ≤ ∞ the conjugate of p, i.e. 1/p + 1/p∗ = 1 with the

convention 1/∞ := 0. Let us agree to write

Ep(Ω, X) := Lp(µ, X) ,

when (Ω, Σ, µ) is a probablity space and 1 ≤ p < +∞, and

E∞(Ω, X) := C(Ω, X) ,

whenever Ω is a compact Hausdorff space. Endowed with their natural norms
both spaces form Banach spaces. If X = C, we simply write

Ep(Ω) := Ep(Ω, C).

The following isometric equalities hold (see [7]):

(5)

(cid:0)Λ(E1(Ω), X)k · kΛ(cid:1) =(cid:0)L(E1(Ω), X),k · k(cid:1)
(cid:0)Λ(E∞(Ω), X)k · kΛ(cid:1) =(cid:0)Π1(E∞(Ω), X), π1(·)(cid:1) ,

where π1(·) as usual stands for the 1-summing norm.
Notice that the set of trigonometric polynomials is dense in Ep∗(TN) for every
1 ≤ p∗ ≤ ∞, so each T ∈ L(Ep∗(TN), X) is uniquely determined by its “Fourier
coefﬁcients” T (ω−α) for α ∈ Z(N). We denote by L+(Ep∗(TN), X) the subset of
all operators T ∈ L(Ep∗(TN), X) with T (ω−α) = 0 whenever α ∈ Z(N) \ N(N)
.
In this sense, each T ∈ L+(Ep∗(TN), X) is uniquely given by its Fourier series

of section 4 is Theorem 4.2 which states that the Bohr transform B establishes an

generalizes results from [5] and [24]. Finally, in section 7 we combine results

of the previous sections to study, among other things, the validity of a vector-
valued version of the Brother’s Riesz Theorem on the inﬁnite-dimensional torus
(Theorem 7.1). Moreover, we characterize when Hp(X ∗) is a dual Banach space,
or when Hp(X ∗) ≡ Ep(TN, X)∗
+, the subspace of the dual of Ep(TN, X) of those
functionals which vanish on elements of the form ω−α ⊗ x for every α ∈ Z(N) \

2. EMBEDDINGS

The aim of the present section is to show the following embedding theorem.

p (X), and the inclusion is

The proof is postponed until the end of the section, once we develop the aux-
iliary results we need, which are of independent interest and will be useful in
other sections. We start with the following simple lemma which is an obvious
consequence of the rotation invariance of the Lebesgue measure on TN.

Lemma 2.2. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and D = Pn ann−s ∈ Hp(X). Then for each
θ ∈ TN we have that
Dθ :=Xn

bnn−s ∈ Hp(X) and kDθkHp(X) = kDkHp(X) ,

where bn := apαθα for n = pα.

For the next result we need a bit more of notation. We denote by H∞(C0, X)
the Banach space of all bounded and holomorphic functions from C0 to X, en-
dowed with the supremum norm, and deﬁne its closed subspace

A(C0, X) := C(C0, X) ∩ H∞(C0, X) .

Proposition 2.3. Given 1 ≤ p < ∞ and a Banach space X, the mapping
(7)
is a well-deﬁned isometric embedding. Moreover, for each D ∈ Hp(X)

Hp(X) ֒→ A(C0,Hp(X)) , D 7→ [z 7→ Dz]

(i) kDε+itkHp(X) = kDεkHp(X) for each ε ≥ 0 and t ∈ R ,
(ii) the map ε 7→ kDεkHp(X) is decreasing on [0,∞),
(iii) and Hp(X)-limε→0+ Dε = D .

Proof. We show in a ﬁrst step that the mapping in (7), restricted to the subspace of
all Dirichlet polynomials in Hp(X), deﬁnes an isometry satisfying (i)-(ii). Take a
Dirichlet polynomial D =PN
n=1 ann−s. By Lemma 2.2 for each ε ≥ 0 and each
t ∈ R

kDε+itkHp(X) = kDεkHp(X) .

The last equality, together with the (distinguished) maximum modulus principle
applied to the function F ∈ A(C0,Hp(X)) , F (z) = Dz, yields that for each

HARDY SPACES OF VECTOR-VALUED DIRICHLET SERIES

7

ε ≥ 0 we have
sup
Re (z)≥εkF (z)kHp(X) = sup

t∈R kF (ε + it)kHp(X) = kDεkHp(X) .

Hence, the statement for Dirichlet polynomials is proved. Take now an arbitrary
Dirichlet series D ∈ Hp(X). Then we can ﬁnd a sequence of Dirichlet poly-
nomials (DN )N ∈N which in Hp(X) is norm-convergent to D. By the previous
discussion the functions

FN ∈ A(C0,Hp(X)) , FN (z) = DN

z

form a Cauchy sequence in A(C0,Hp(X)). Denote its limit in A(C0,Hp(X)) by
F . Given z ∈ C0, we show that

i.e. an(Dz) = an(F (z)) for each n. Indeed, we have that

Dz = F (z) ∈ Hp(X),

and as a consequence for each n

an(DN )n−z = an(F (z)) .

Finally, the statements (i) and (ii) are simple consequence since we already proved
them for polynomials; and (iii), being evident for polynomials, follows from the
continuity of the embedding in (7).

3. APPROXIMATION

We need the following quantitative version of Bohr’s fundamental theorem (see
Theorem 1.1). The proof follows exactly the lines from the scalar case that can
be found in [3] or [29].

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.1. There exists a constant C > 0 such that every Dirichlet series

D =Pn ann−s ∈ D∞(X) we have that for each x > 1

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Xn≤x

ann−s(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)D∞(X) ≤ C log xkDkD∞(X) .

The following result extends [6, Theorem 3.2] from the scalar case to the
vector-valued case (in the scalar case see also [1, Corollary 4] which proves that
the 1/ns for 1 < p < ∞ even form a Schauder bases in Hp(C)).

every Dirichlet series D =Pn ann−s ∈ H+

p (X) we have that

(ann−s)n−z(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)D∞(Hp(X))

Proof. The proof of the case 1 ≤ p < ∞ is surprinsingly simple if we combine
Theorem 3.1 with the embedding H+
p (X) in D∞(Hp(X)) given in Theorem 2.4
(which has been already proved for this value of p). Indeed, for any Dirichlet

Let us prove now the case p = +∞. If D ∈ H+
p (X) for each
∞(X), then D ∈ H+
p ∈ [1, +∞) and so inequality (10) is satisﬁed for every such p. By Lemma 2.5,
we can then take limit p → +∞ in (10) to get the desired conclusion.

useful and can be found in [31, Theorem IV.3.3].
Lemma 4.1. Let E be a Banach lattice and T ∈ L(E, X). The following state-
ments are equivalent:

(i) T is cone absolutely summing with constant C.
(ii) There is ξ∗ ∈ E∗,kξ∗k = C such that kT (ξ)kX ≤ ξ∗(|ξ|) for every ξ ∈ E.
We turn our attention now on the Banach lattices Ep∗(TN) and the spaces
Λ+(cid:0)Ep∗(TN), X(cid:1) described in the introduction. Recall that every T belonging
to Λ+(cid:0)Ep∗(TN), X(cid:1) is uniquely determined by its Fourier series (6), a formal

power series in inﬁnitely variables, which in turn corresponds to a Dirichlet series
using Bohr transform.
Theorem 4.2. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. The Bohr transform B deﬁnes a linear onto
isometry

kernel in m dimensions is carried out.

the linear operators Pm : Ep(TN, X) → Ep(TN, X) , Pm(f ) = fm are uniformly
bounded by 1, and on the dense subspace of all trigonometric polynomials they
converge to the identity pointwise whenever m tends to inﬁnity. This completes
the argument.

The case p = 1: Again by Lemma 4.1 there exists a non-negative regular Borel
measure µ ∈ M(TN) = C(TN)∗ = E∞(TN)∗ with kµk = kTkΛ satisfying
kT (f )kX ≤ RTN |f| dµ for all f ∈ C(TN). Using the canonical embedding
C(Tm) ֒→ C(TN), we have that the restriction of µ to C(Tm) gives a non-negative
regular Borel measure on Tm with kµmk ≤ kµk. Hence by the deﬁnition from

where C is the universal constant from Theorem 3.2. Indeed, for such N take
m ∈ N big enough so that every 1 ≤ n ≤ N belongs to {pα : α ∈ Nm

deduce from (18) and the mentioned Theorem 3.2 that for each ε > 0

Taking now limits when ε → 0+ in the previous expression, we get (19).
Reasoning as in the proof of Corollary 3.3, it follows from (19) that the partial
sums of Dε converge in Hp(X). Hence by the uniqueness of the coefﬁcients we
obtain that Dε ∈ Hp(X). We still have to control the norms of these translations
Dε of D. Using (18) and Lemma 4.3 we deduce that

kDεkHp(X) = lim

This means that

and so D ∈ H+

In a second step we have to prove that the Bohr transform B in fact deﬁnes an
isometry onto from Λ+(cid:0)Ep∗(TN), X(cid:1) into H+
∞(X), so let D(s) = Pn ann−s ∈
p (X). For each ε > 0, denote fε = B−1(Dε) ∈ Hp(TN, X). We can deﬁne

density of these polynomials in E∗
p(TN) allows us to extend T to a bounded linear
operator on E∗
p(TN), that we for simplicity again denote by T , which satisﬁes
kT (ψ)kX ≤ ξ∗(|ψ|) for each ψ ∈ Ep∗(TN). Hence T ∈ Λ+(Ep∗(TN), X) with

5. ARNP

p (X) (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞) shown in Theorem

2.1 does not have to be onto. To see an example consider the Dirichlet series

The isometric inclusion Hp(X) ֒→ H+
D =Xn
in the Banach space c0 of all null sequences, where en, n ∈ N as usual stands
for the canonical basis. Then D ∈ H+
∞(c0) since it obviously converges on
C0 and kD(s)kc0 ≤ 1 for each s ∈ C0. But it does not belong to H∞(c0) ≡
H∞(TN, c0) since the fact that kenkc0 = 1 for each n would contradict the Lemma
of Lebesgue-Riemann. This is essentially the same example that one may give to
show that the inclusion H∞(T, X) ֒→ H∞(D, X) (described in the introduction)
is strict. In fact, both inclusions are related.
Lemma 5.1. If H+

∞(X) = H∞(X), then H∞(T, X) ֒→ H∞(D, X) is onto.

A. DEFANT AND A. PÉREZ

Proof. Let F ∈ H∞(D, X), with F (z) = Pn cnzn. Since s 7→ 2−s is a diffeo-
morphism from C0 onto D, the Dirichlet series D(s) = F (2−s) = P∞
n=1 cn2−s

(s ∈ C0) belongs to H+
long to H∞(X), which means that we can ﬁnd a function f ∈ H∞(TN, X) with
Fourier series f ≡ Pn∈N0

the function of H∞(T, X) corresponding to F .

The previous result leads to the question of whether the converse is true. We
will see that this is the case. We recall the following Banach space property which
characterizes when the isometry H∞(T, X) ֒→ H∞(D, X) is onto:
erty (ARNP) if every F ∈ H∞(D, X) satisﬁes that
(21)

A complex Banach space X is said to have the Analytic Radon-Nikodým Prop-

F (Rω)

exists for almost every ω ∈ T.

lim
R→1−

This notion was ﬁrstly considered and studied by Bukhvalov and Danilevich
[13, 14]. It is a weaker property than the more known Radon-Nikodým Property,
and strictly weaker as every Banach lattice without copies of c0 has the ARNP
[14, p.105, Theorem 1], which in particular implies that L1[0, 1] posseses this
property although it does not have the RNP.

It will be convenient for us to work in open half-spaces. We will make use of

the well-known Cayley transformation, given by

ϕ(z) =

1 + z
1 − z

(z ∈ D).

This map establishes a diffeomorphism between the open disc D and the right
open halfplane C0, and also satisﬁes that ϕ(eiu) = i cot (u/2) for every u ∈ R.
Notice that g : (0, 2π) → R, g(u) = cot (u/2) is a diffeomorphism.
Observation 5.2. If F ∈ H∞(D, X) satisﬁes (21), then one can even show that
the following limit exists

lim

z→ω,z∈S(ω,α)

F (z)

exists for almost every ω ∈ T,

where

S(ω, α) := {z ∈ D : |z − ω| < α(1 − |z|)} (α > 1).

The proof of this fact in the scalar-case can be found in [27], and the arguments
can be extrapolated to the vector-valued case with no much difﬁculty: indeed,
from (21) we get f ∈ H∞(T, X) deﬁned as f (ω) = limR→1− F (Rω) a.e. which
represents F as in (3). Following then [27, section 3], but working with the max-
imal function of the scalar-valued function ω 7→ kf (ω)kX (which is measurable
and essentially bounded), we can adapt the proof of [27, Theorem 3.2] to get the
conclusion for F .
Lemma 5.3. Let F : C0 → X be a bounded and holomorphic function. If X has
the ARNP, then limε→0+ F (ε + it) exists for Lebesgue-almost all t ∈ R.

HARDY SPACES OF VECTOR-VALUED DIRICHLET SERIES

Proof. Let us denote f = F ◦ ϕ which is a bounded and holomorphic function
on D. We claim that for any α > 1, ϕ−1(ε + it) converges to ϕ−1(it) inside
S(ϕ−1(it), α) when ε goes to zero. Indeed, one can easily check that

|ϕ−1(ε + it) − ϕ−1(it)|

1 − |ϕ−1(ε + it)|

= p(1 + ε)2 + t2 +p(1 − ε)2 + t2

2√1 + t2

.

Using Observation 5.2, we deduce that if X has the ARNP, then

lim

z→ω,z∈S(ω,α)

f (z)

exists for every ω ∈ A ⊂ T, being A a set with Haar measure equal to one.
Combining this fact with the claim above, we deduce that

lim
ε→0+

f (ϕ−1(ε + it)) = lim
ε→0+

F (ε + it)

exists for every t ∈ g(A). Finally, a diffeomorphism maps measurable sets into
measurable sets and null sets into null sets, so λ(g(A)) = 1.

(cid:3)

Theorem 5.4. Given a Banach space X, the following are equivalent:

p (X) = Hp(X) for every 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.
p (X) = Hp(X) for some 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.

(i) X has the ARNP.
(ii) H+

we know that Lp(TN, X) has the ARNP by a result of Dowling [23], and so does
its subspace Hp(TN, X) = Hp(X). We can therefore use (22) and combine it
with Lemma 5.3 in order to conclude that for Lebesgue-almost all t ∈ R

But then the rotation-invariance of the Lebesgue measure on TN (see again Lemma

nε+it n−s =Xn
2.2) yields that as desired D =Pn ann−s ∈ Hp(X).
This handles the case 1 ≤ p < ∞; let us add the proof of (i) ⇒ (ii) for p = ∞.
We show that if H+

6. HOLOMORPHY

In the scalar case Hardy spaces on the inﬁnite dimensional torus and Hardy
spaces of Dirichlet series can be identiﬁed with certain spaces of holomorphic
functions in inﬁnitely many variables (see e.g. [5],[16], and [24]). A combination
of these ideas with those of the previous sections leads to interesting descriptions
of Hp(X) and H+
Let us ﬁx S ⊂ c0 a Banach space sequence, i.e., a Banach space of sequences
in c0 such that the canonical vectors en, n ∈ N form a 1-unconditional basis. We
consider the open unit ball Bc0 ∩ S as an open subset of S, and deﬁne

p (X) in terms of inﬁnite dimensional holomorphy.

H∞(Bc0 ∩ S, X)

Hp(Bc0 ∩ S, X)

where πm : Bc0 ∩ S → Dm denotes the projection onto the ﬁrst m variables.
Hp(Dm, X) is even 1-complemented since for each F ∈ Hp(Bc0 ∩ S, X) its
restriction Fm to the ﬁrst m variables belongs to Hp(Dm, X) with kFmkp ≤ kFkp.

Lemma 6.1. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and S as above. The Bohr transform establishes a
contraction B : Hp(Bc0 ∩ S, X) → H+
Proof. Using Theorem 4.2, it is enough to show that for each F ∈ Hp(Bc0∩S, X)
there is an operator T ∈ Λ+(Ep∗, X) with equal norm and such that the Fourier
coefﬁcients T (ω−α) equal the monomial coefﬁcients cα(F ). Since we will reason
as in the proof of the surjectivity in Theorem 4.2, we omit some details. Given
F ∈ Hp(Bc0 ∩ S, X), we deﬁne a linear map

T : span{ωα : α ∈ Z(N)} → X by T (ω−α) = cα(F ), α ∈ N(N)

Since {kFm(r·)kX : 0 < r < 1, m ∈ N} is bounded in Lp(TN) ⊂ (Ep∗)∗, more
precisely contained in kFkHp(Bc0 ∩S,X)BLp(TN), we can take

which satisﬁes kξ∗k(Ep∗ )∗ ≤ kFkHp(Bc0 ∩S,X) and kT (ψ)kX ≤ ξ∗(|ψ|) for every
trigonometric polynomial ψ in inﬁnitely many variables. Finally, the operator T
extends to an element in Λ+(Ep∗, X) with the desired properties (see the proof of
Theorem 4.2 for details).
(cid:3)

We ﬁnally prove that for p = ∞ and S = Bc0 as well as 1 ≤ p < ∞ and
S = ℓ2 the contraction from the preceding lemma is even an onto isometry. To
start let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and T ∈ Λ+(Ep∗, X). Then for every m ∈ N we have a

kf (z)kX ≤ max

1≤n≤m|zn|;

Proof. Lemma 6.1 states that B is a well-deﬁned contraction. The argument that
it is an onto isometry will make use of the following version of Schwartz’ lemma
which can be easily extended to the multi-dimensional case, and by composing
with functionals in a second step to the vector-valued setting: If f : Dm → X is a
holomorphic function with f (0) = 0 and kf (z)kX < 1 for each z ∈ Dm, then for
each z = (z1, . . . , zm) ∈ Dm
(25)
indeed, for X = C and z1, . . . , zm ∈ D (not all null) consider

and apply Schwartz’ Lemma to get |g(ζ)| ≤ |ζ| for all ζ ∈ D. Hence as desired
|g(maxn |zn|)| ≤ maxn |zn|.
Let D ∈ H+
Deﬁne the sequence (Fm)m in H∞(Bc0, X) from (23) which by (24) satisﬁes
(26)
We show that (Fm)m forms a Cauchy sequence in H∞(Bc0, X) endowed with the
compact-open topology: For 1 ≤ m < M and ﬁxed u ∈ Dm, v ∈ DN we apply
(25) to the function

kFmkH∞(Bc0 ,X) ≤ kTkΛ , m ∈ N .

f : Dm → X , z = (zm+1, . . . , zM ) 7→ Fm(u, z, v) − FM (u, z, v) ,

and obtain that for all z ∈ Bc0

kFm(z) − FM (z)kX ≤ 2kTkΛ max{|zn| : m ≤ n ≤ M}.

This gives that (Fm)m converges uniformly on each compact set

K =(cid:8)z : |zn| ≤ rn(cid:9) ⊂ Bc0 with (rn)n ∈ Bc0 .

Since every compact subset of Bc0 is contained in such a set K, we apply Montel’s
theorem and get some F ∈ H∞(Bc0, X) such that Fm → F uniformly on all
compact subsets of Bco. Moreover, F is bounded by (26) with kFk∞ ≤ kTkΛ.
To ﬁnish the proof of the surjectivity it remains to show that D = B(F ), i.e.,
cα0(F ) = an0(D) whenever α0 ∈ Nm0
0 and n0 = pα0. Indeed, Fm → F uniformly
on Dm0, hence limm cα0(Fm) = cα0(F ). But by deﬁnition cα0(Fm) = T (ω−α0) =
an0(D) for m ≥ m0.
Finally, we explain why F (p−s) = P∞
ns for Re (s) > 0: Note ﬁrst that
both functions D(s) and F (p−s) are holomorphic on C0. On the other hand,
D converges absolutely for Re (s) > 1 (we have that |an(D)| ≤ kTkΛ for all
n), and since D = B(F ) this implies that Pα∈N(N)
|cα(F )p−s| < ∞. Since F
is continuous in p−s ∈ Bc0, we obtain that F (p−s) = Pα∈N(N)
cα(F )p−αs, and
hence F (p−s) =P∞
ns for Re (s) > 1. But now the identity theorem shows
The ﬁnal theorem is the Hp-analog of the preceding one.

that as desired F (p−s) = D(s) on C0. This completes the proof.

from Hp(Bc0 ∩ ℓ2, X) into H+
Moreover, if D = B(F ), then F (p−s) =Pn ann−s whenever Re (s) > 1/2.

Proof. We follow the strategy of the previous proof. Indeed, our main tool this
time is the following inequality, which is proved in [16], but can be easily ex-
tended to the vector-valued setting by composing with functionals: For each
f ∈ Hp(Dm, X) and z ∈ Dm

Take D ∈ H+
Theorem 4.2. For every m ∈ N, let Fm be as in (23), which by the discussion
above belongs to Hp(Dm, X) with kFmkHp(Dm,X) ≤ kTkΛ. Given a sequence
a = (an)n∈N ∈ ℓ2 ∩ Bc0, deﬁne the set Ka := {z ∈ c0 : |zn| ≤ |an|} which is
compact in ℓ2 . Then by (27) we see that for every z ∈ Ka and every m

kFm(z)kX ≤ kTkΛ+

(1 − |an|2)−1/p .

∞Yn=1

This means that (Fm)m is a uniformly bounded sequence of holomorphic X-
valued functions on Bc0. Using (25) and reasoning as in the proof of the previous
theorem, we deduce that (Fm)m converges uniformly on every set Ka ⊂ Bc0
with a ∈ ℓ2 ∩ Bc0. Since every compact subset of Bc0 ∩ ℓ2 is contained in
some Ka, this proves (by Montel’s theorem) that there is a holomophic func-
tion F : Bc0 ∩ ℓ2 → X such that Fm → F uniformly on every compact set of
ℓ2 ∩ Bc0. From (24) we deduce that
kFkHp(Bc0 ∩ℓ2,X) = sup

m kFmkHp(Bc0 ∩ℓ2,X) ≤ kTkΛ+ ,

which shows (as above) that F = B−1D is the desired inverse image of D under
the Bohr transform.
Let us ﬁnish with the argument for the second statement in the theorem: We
have that F (p−s) = Pn ann−s for Re (s) > 1 as the Dirichlet series and the
monomial expansion of F converge absolutely. Fix some ε > 0, then the function
s 7→ F (p−s) is bounded on C1/2+ε and extends D(s). By Bohr’s Fundamental
Theorem 1.1 we conclude thatPn ann−s converges uniformly on C1/2+ε. There-
fore both holomorphic functions F (p−s) and D(s) must coincide on C1/2+ε. (cid:3)

The proof of the previous Theorem 6.3 relies on inequality (27), which forces
us to work in z ∈ ℓ2 so that the inﬁnite product is convergent. This contrasts with
the case p = ∞ of Theorem 6.2 in which can be taken S = c0, so it is natural to
ask if we can consider a bigger Banach space sequence S for some 1 ≤ p < ∞,
so that we can identify Hp(Bc0 ∩ S, X) and H+

Proof. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there is a = (an)n∈N ∈ S \
ℓ2. This means that we can ﬁnd (ξn)n∈N ∈ ℓ2 such that (cid:0)|Pm
n=1 ξnan|(cid:1)m
is
unbounded. Without loss of generality we can assume that a ∈ Bc0. Consider
the sequence of trigonometric polynomials Qm(z) = Pm
k=1 ξkzk , m ∈ N. By
Khintchine’s inequality, there exists a constant C > 0 (independent of ξ) such
that for every 1 ≤ n < m
kQm − Qnkp ≤ C(cid:16)Pn<k≤m |ξk|2(cid:17)1/2

This means that (Qm)m is a Cauchy sequence in Hp(Bc0 ∩ S, X). But this space
is assumed to be complete, so it converges to some F ∈ Hp(Bc0 ∩ S, X) which
must be of the form F ≡ Pk ξkzk. By continuity, F (a) = limmPm
n=1 ξnan,
contradicting the choice of (ξn)n∈N.
(cid:3)

.

A careful look at the proofs of Theorems 6.3 and 6.2 reveals as an underlying
idea what we call a Hilbert’s criterion, i.e., a criterion to decide whether a formal
power series is generated by a holomorphic function in Hp(Bc0 ∩ Sp, X), where
Sp = c0 if p = +∞ and Sp = ℓ2 if 1 ≤ p < +∞.
Corollary 6.5. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞. Given a family (cα)α in X, the following
assertions are equivalent:
(i) There is F ∈ Hp(Bc0 ∩ Sp, X) satisfying cα(F ) = cα for each α ∈ N(N)
.
(ii) There exists a sequence (fm) in Hp(Dm, X) such that

0

(ii.1) cα(fm) = cα for each α ∈ Nm
(ii.2) supm∈N kfmkHp(Dm,X) < +∞

0

Moreover, in that case kFkHp(Bc0 ∩Sp,X) = supm∈N kfmkHp(Dm,X).
Proof. If (i) is satisﬁed, then, taking for fm := Fm the restriction of F to Dm ⊂
Bc0 ∩ Sp, we have that (ii) is satisﬁed with

m∈N kFmkHp(Dm,X) ≤ kFkHp(Bc0 ∩Sp,X) .
sup

To see the converse, notice that the proofs of Theorems 6.3 and 6.2 show precisely
that, starting with (fm)m∈N, there is F ∈ Hp(Bc0 ∩ Sp, X) whose restriction Fm
to Dm equals fm and satisﬁes kFkHp(Bc0 ∩Sp,X) ≤ supm∈N kFmkHp(Dm,X).

Recall that if (Ω,B) is a measure space, then a vector measure m : B → X is

of bounded variation if

|m|(Ω) = sup

km(A)kX < +∞ ,

π XA∈π

where the supremum is taken over all ﬁnite partitions of Ω into (disjoint) elements
of B. If Ω is a compact space and B = B(Ω) is the Borel σ-algebra on Ω, consider
M(B, X) to be the space of all regular countably additive vector measures of
bounded variation. This is a Banach space when endowed with the variation

as norm. Following [21, p. 380, Theorem 2], we have the natural isometric
identiﬁcation

M(B, X) ≡ Λ(C(Ω), X) , m 7→ Tm(f ) =ZΩ

f dm .

If we restrict ourselves to Ω = TN, then we write M(TN, X) = M(B(TN), X),
and the previous identiﬁcation gives

M +(TN, X) ≡ Λ+(C(TN), X) ,

where M +(TN, X) denotes the subspace of M(TN, X) consisting of all vector
measures m that are analytic, i.e. satisfy

We now formulate a vector-valued version of the classical Brother’s Riesz The-
orem in the inﬁnite dimensional torus. The scalar case is a well-known result for
topological groups from [26], and an alternative and different approach for the
inﬁnite dimensional torus was recently given in [2, Corollary 1]. Recall that the
connection between ARNP and the validity of a vector-valued Brother’s Riesz
Theorem for the one-dimensional torus was ﬁrstly noticed by Dowling [22].
Theorem 7.1. A Banach space X has the ARNP if and only if for every m ∈
M +(B(TN), X) there exists f ∈ H1(TN, X) satisfying
(31)

f (ω) dω for every A ∈ B(TN) .

m(A) =ZA

Proof. By Theorems 4.2 and 5.4, X has the ARNP if and only if for each operator
T ∈ Λ+(E∞, X) there is a (unique) function f ∈ H1(TN, X) such that T (ω−α) =
ˆf (α) for all α ∈ N(N)
. But since the trigonometric polynomials are dense in
C(TN), this is equivalent to the fact that for every such T there is a function
f ∈ H1(TN, X) satisfying
T (g) =ZTN
(32)

f (ω)g(ω)dω for each g ∈ C(TN) .

0

Using the identiﬁcation (28), we conclude that f satisﬁes (32) if and only if the
measure m identiﬁed with T satisﬁes (30). This ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

We give now another representation theorem for spaces of vector-valued func-

tions, relating duality and the ARNP. Consider the embedding
E ⊗ X ֒→ Λ(E∗, X) , ξ ⊗ x 7→ [ξ∗ 7→ ξ∗(ξ)x] .

If we denote by E ˜⊗ΛX the completion of E ⊗ X with the induced norm k · kΛ,
then it is shown in [31, p. 277] that the following isometric equality holds:

Λ(E, X ∗) = (E ˜⊗ΛX)∗ , T 7→ [ξ ⊗ x 7→ (T ξ)x] .

(33)
Moreover, if we restrict ourselves to the Banach lattices Ep(Ω), 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞
deﬁned in the introduction, then there is a canonical isometric isomorphism (see

22

A. DEFANT AND A. PÉREZ

[31, Examples, p. 274-5])

Ep(Ω) ˜⊗ΛX = Ep(Ω, X).

(34)
Combining (33) and (34), we obtain for each 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ the isometric identity
(35)
For every 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞, deﬁne

Λ(Ep(Ω), X ∗) = Ep(Ω, X)∗.

+

as the (weak∗-closed) subspace of Ep(TN, X)∗ made of those functionals which
vanish on elements of the form ω−α ⊗ x for every α ∈ Z(N) \ N(N)
and x ∈ X.
Restricting the identity from (35) to Λ+(Ep(TN X ∗), and using Theorem 4.2, we
get the following result.
Proposition 7.2. For every 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ the Bohr transform establishes a canoni-
cal isometric isomorphism

If we now again allow the ARNP to enter the stage, then we arrive at the fol-

lowing:

Theorem 7.3. Given a Banach space X, the following assertions are equivalent:

(i) X ∗ has the ARNP.
(ii) Hp(X ∗) is a dual Banach space for every (resp. some) 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞.
(iii) Ep(TN, X)∗

+ ≡ Hp(X ∗) for every (resp. some) 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞.

Proof. The equivalence (i) ⇔ (iii) is an immediate consequence of Proposition
7.2 and Theorem 5.4. (iii) ⇒ (ii): Ep(TN, X)∗
+ is a dual, as it is a weak∗-closed
subspace of a dual by its very deﬁnition. (ii) ⇒ (i): Let us ﬁx 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ such
that Hp(X ∗) is (isometrically) isomorphic to the dual Y ∗ of a Banach space Y .
p (X ∗) = Hp(X ∗). Given D =Pn a∗
Our aim is to show that H+
p (X ∗),
we have by deﬁnition that (Dε)ε>0 is a bounded family in Y ∗ = Hp(X ∗), so we
can (by Alouglu’s Theorem) take a weak∗-cluster point ˜D = Pn ˜a∗
nn−s ∈ Y ∗ of
the net (Dε)ε>0 when ε goes to zero. We check now that D = ˜D, or equivalently,
N for each N. This is a consequence of the following observation:
that a∗
for each x ∈ X and N the functional Pn a∗
N , xi is an element in
Hp(X ∗)∗ = Y ∗∗ which is weak∗-continuous, so it belongs to Y . In particular, this
yields that

We ﬁnish with a Hilbert criterion for Hp(TN, X) (see also Corollary 6.5). This
result is an immediate consequence of Corollary 6.5 combined with the Theorems
5.4 , 6.2 and 6.3.
Proposition 7.4. Let X have the ARNP and 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. Then for any family
(cα)α in X the following assertions are equivalent:

.

(i) There is f ∈ Hp(TN, X) satisfying ˆf (α) = cα for each α ∈ N(N)
(ii) There exists a sequence fm ∈ Hp(Tm, X) such that

(ii.1) ˆfm(α) = cα for each α ∈ Nm

(ii.2) supm∈N kfmkHp(Tm,X) < +∞.

Moreover, in that case kfkHp(TN,X) = supm∈N kfmkHp(Tm,X).
Remark 7.5. We strongly believe that the previous property characterizes the
ARNP for X.
