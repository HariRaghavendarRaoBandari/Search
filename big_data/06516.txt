Abstract

We present a laboratory experiment of the growth of a turbulent patch in a stably stratiﬁed ﬂuid,

due to a localized source of turbulence, generated by an oscillating grid. Synchronized and over-

lapping particle image velocimetry and planar laser induced ﬂuorescence measurements have been

conducted capturing the evolution of the patch through its initial growth until it reached a maxi-

mum size, followed by its collapse. The simultaneous measurements of density and velocity ﬁelds

allow for a direct quantiﬁcation of the degree of mixing within the patch, the propagation speed

of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface and its thickness. The velocity measurements indicate

signiﬁcant non-equilibrium eﬀects inside the patch which are not consistent with the classical used

grid-action model. A local analysis of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface provides direct mea-

surements of the entrainment velocity we as compared to the local vertical velocity and turbulent

intensity at the proximity of the interface. It is found that the entrainment rate E is constrained

in the range of 0 ÷ 0.1 and that the local, gradient Richardson number at the interface is O(100).
Finally, we show that the mean ﬂow is responsible for the patch collapse.

INTRODUCTION

In the stably stratiﬁed thermocline of the open ocean, turbulence is important for diapy-

cnal transport and mixing of energy, mass, heat, nutrients and chemicals. Turbulence in the

ocean drives vertical transport and mixing against the stabilizing eﬀect of the ambient strat-

iﬁcation through a variety of processes occurring in mid-water [2, 3, 6, 21, 30]. Furthermore,

in regions of strong bathymetric variations [16, 20, 27], topographically generated turbulence
can extend to O(1km) above the bottom and can drive signiﬁcant mixing of the strongly
stratiﬁed ambient ﬂuid [17]. These turbulent processes are evident as strong localized per-

turbations in horizontal and vertical small scales ﬂow measurements [24, 28], presumably

formed by the breaking of internal waves. Such intermittent signatures motivated studies of

stratiﬁed turbulent patches – a localized volumes of turbulent activity – as one of the promi-

nent oceanic processes [18, 19]. Understanding of the internal structure and mechanisms of

a turbulent patch may provide insight and lead to improved parameterizations of oceanic

turbulent transport and mixing [4, 32].

Diﬀerent types of laboratory experiments have been conducted to study turbulent patches

in stably stratiﬁed ﬂuid layers. Growth of localized turbulent sources was studied in the

context of wakes of self-propelled bodies in stratiﬁed environment [22, 26, 36]. The studies

used impulsively or continuously forced patches due to self-propelled bodies, and the main

focus of these studies is on the later times of the momentumless wake evolution. Van de

Watering [36] mechanically created a patch in a quiescent linearly stratiﬁed ﬂow, studying

the growth rate and the upper vertical size limit of a patch. Wu [37] measured the evolution

of an intrusion formed by the injection of ﬂuid with uniform density into a stably stratiﬁed

environment, which is in the vertical direction is somewhat similar to the growth of a patch.

Fernando and co-authors [11, 13] studied the growth of turbulent patches using a hori-

zontally oriented oscillating grid spanning the full extent of the tank. It was found that the
patch vertical size growth rate was initially unaﬀected by the stratiﬁcation, until N t ≈ 4
when it started to slow down. Here N 2 = (−g/ρ0)dρ/dz is the square of the Brunt-V¨ais¨al¨a
buoyancy frequency of the ambient ﬂuid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, ρ is the density

and ρ0 is a reference density. De Silva and Fernando [11] carried out laboratory experiments

of a localized turbulent patch focusing on its collapse and the subsequent intrusive gravity

current. Similarly to the experiments with the oscillating grid spanning the entire tank, the

2

localized patch grew vertically until N t ≈ 4, after which a reduction of the vertical patch
extent was observed. The gravity current formed as a result of the mixing inside the patch,

which created hydrostatic pressures that are larger inside the patch than in the ambient,

thereby providing a forcing for the gravity current.

The goal of this work is to better understand the early patch dynamics preceding the

formation of an intrusive gravity current. We extend the previous studies by considering a

patch that is free to grow in all directions. We utilize particle image velocimetry (PIV) and

planar laser induced ﬂuorescence (PLIF) techniques that enable simultaneous measurements

of velocity and density ﬁelds inside and outside the patch during its initial growth phase.

The data is used to provide insight into the ﬂuid dynamics inside the patch, the buoyancy

distribution and conduct a local analysis of the turbulent-non turbulent interface.

The paper is organized as follows. Section presents the experimental setup and mea-

surement techniques, speciﬁcally the details of the PIV and PLIF calibration. Section

demonstrates the results in terms of the initial growth of the patch and its spatially aver-

aged characteristics as well as the local analysis near the turbulent/non-turbulent interface

(TNTI), aiming at processes responsible for the TNTI propagation. Discussion and con-

cluding remarks appear in Section .

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The problem studied here is a localized mixed turbulent region in linear stable density

proﬁle ρ(z) shown schematically in Fig. 1a. In our experimental case it corresponds to a

buoyancy frequency of N = 1 s−1, measured by PLIF as well as by a pycnometer with small

volumes of liquid extracted at diﬀerent depths.

In order to measure the key parameters of the problem, we create a localized source of

turbulence in a stably stratiﬁed environment, and measure the turbulent ﬂow as it evolves

in time. We follow the patch using optical measurement methods, starting from rest (t = 0)

through the growth phase up to its collapse. During the experiments, we maintain the

refractive index matching in order to allow for accurate density and velocity measurements

at high spatial resolution as described in Section .

The experiments are performed in a glass tank with a 200 × 500 mm2 cross-section and
a depth of 200 mm. Experiments are carried out in diﬀerent solutions of an index-of-

3

refraction matched stratiﬁed mixture of sugar, water and Epsom salts following the method

of McDougall [25] described in details below. A stable linear density gradient is established

in the tank using the free-ﬂow two-tank method [12].

Turbulent agitation

The patch is created using an oscillating grid located at the center of the tank. The grid
size is 60 × 60 mm2 constructed of plastic square bars of 2 mm and a mesh size of 10 mm
giving a solidity of 30.6%. The oscillations are provided via a slide on a linear ball-bearing

rail connected to a motor with an eccentric linkage. The stroke length (top of stroke to

bottom of stroke) is 10 mm. Over the ﬁrst two seconds of the oscillations, the motor is

provided a ramp input to minimize any impulse from the start-up procedure and followed

by a steady current input while the oscillations last for 8 seconds in total. The forcing is

stopped after 8 seconds, in order to maintain the stratiﬁed layers for at least 6 sequential

runs. The oscillation frequency obtained after the initial ramp input ranges between 3 to 8

Hz in increments of 1 Hz.

The patch initially grows as a result of the agitation until it reaches a maximum. The

vertical patch size will be denoted δ and the typical turbulent velocity scale associated

with the turbulence inside the patch will be denoted σu. Both δ as σu will be deﬁned

rigorously in Section . In Table I, the measurements of the maximum patch size, δmax and

the corresponding level of turbulence, σu(δmax) are presented for the 6 diﬀerent frequencies.

The key dimensionless parameters characterizing the patch dynamics are the bulk

Reynolds number Re = σuδ/ν, representative of turbulence strength relative to viscos-

ity, and the bulk Richardson number Ri = N 2δ2/σ2

u, representative of the strength of the

stratiﬁcation relative to turbulence levels inside the patch. In Table I we report that the

Re ranges from 50 to 400 whilst Ri ranges from 50 to 150, indicating that the stratiﬁcation

is relatively strong in this setup as compared to the turbulence levels. In the results and
discussion sections we will refer to the experiments by their forcing frequency, f = 3÷ 8 Hz,
which is directly proportional to the bulk Reynolds number.

Refractive index matching

Obtaining a linear stable stratiﬁcation using variations in salt concentration is a com-

monly used experimental technique [11, 13, 33]. However, when using optical methods there

are some concerns about the distortion of the light path of the laser [25] in addition to the

deviation of the light paths towards the camera [1].

The solution in the present case follows the work of McDougall [25] and makes use of two

liquids: a sugar-water solution and an Epsom salt (MgS04) - water solution. The refractive

index, n and density, ρ (at 20 oC, measured in g/mL) can be expressed by a Taylor series

following McDougall [25] as:

n(z) = 1.3330 + 0.20286CA(z) + 0.14445CB(z) + O(z2)
ρ(z) = 0.9982 + 1.0054CA(z) + 0.38407CB(z) + O(z2)

(1)

where CA and CB are the concentrations (weight of solute per unit weight of solution) of

Epsom-salt and sugar, respectively. The desired density diﬀerence of 20 g/L between the

bottom of the tank and the free surface is obtained with a maximum diﬀerence in the index

of refraction which compares favorably with previous studies [9]. The maximum diﬀerence

in the index of refraction of ∆n < 0.00001 is obtained in each solution separately and for

the two solutions being mixed in agreement with the results of McDougall [25].

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)

Two-dimensional, two-component PIV measurements are performed in a vertical plane

passing through the horizontal center of the tank as shown in Fig. 1b. The PIV system

in this study is composed of a Nd:YAG laser (120 mJ/pulse, wavelength of 532 nm) and

a 11 MP double-exposure CCD camera with a 12-bit sensor. The imaging set-up yields a

physical magniﬁcation of 56.2 µm/pixel.

The PIV image pairs are processed using the open source software described in Taylor et
al. [34] (www.openpiv.net) with interrogation windows of 32 × 32 pixels2 and 50% overlap.
Spurious vectors are identiﬁed ﬁrst by a global ﬁlter and followed by a local median ﬁlter.

The rejected vectors are replaced by interpolation using the local mean and the data are

smoothed using a Gaussian ﬁlter.

PIV measurements are performed such that tracers (polyamid spheres, mean diameter

of 50 µm, ρp = 1.03 g/cm3, Dantec Inc.) have an average displacement of approximately

5 pixels for each experiment. The timing is set from time interval ∆t = 0.018 s for the

f = 3 Hz experiment down to ∆t = 0.006 s for the f = 8 Hz run. External triggering

system initiates the motion of the grid and the ﬁrst PIV image pair at the same time. In

addition, the PIV measurements are synchronized with the overlapping PLIF measurements

to obtain simultaneous measurements of density and velocity.

6

Planar laser induced ﬂuorescence (PLIF)

PLIF camera takes images simultaneously with the PIV measurements using the setup

shown in Fig. 1b. The PLIF method enables the measurement of the spatial density

distribution. Rhodamine 6G is added to the mixing tank of the heavier liquid (the Ep-

som salt solution) at a concentration of 50 µg/L. The density can be obtained through

measurements of the Rhodamine 6G concentration. This technique has previously been

used in the study of interfacial mixing in stratiﬁed environments [5], wave breaking [35],

jets [31], and in stratiﬁed gravity currents [29]. The common assumption that the Rho-

damine 6G follows the density ﬁeld relies on the notion that the diﬀusivity of turbulence
(κT ≈ σu × l = 1 cm2s−1) is signiﬁcantly greater than the molecular diﬀusivity of the Rho-
damine 6G (κR6G = 0.12 × 10−5 cm2s−1), Epsom salt (κM gS04 = 0.61 × 10−5 cm2s−1), and
sucrose (κs = 0.45 × 10−5 cm2s−1). Thus, the Batchelor scale λB (= η/Sc1/2), of the Epsom
salt, which we estimate using the Kolmogorov length scale (η ≈ 200 µm based on the turbu-
lent velocity and length scales) and the Schmidt number of the Epsom salt, Sc (= ν/κ), is

found to be of the order of 10 µm. This scale is much smaller than the size covered by one

pixel (56 µm). The under-resolution of the density ﬁeld is due to the need to accommodate

the large ﬁeld-of-view of the experiment, following the motion of the growing patch.

The CCD camera for the PLIF measurements is identical to the PIV camera (11 MP, 12

bit camera). Both cameras are equipped with 60 mm Nikkor lenses. A bandpass optical
ﬁlter (Newport 20BPF10-550) with an admittance band of 550 ± 10 nm is ﬁtted to the
PLIF camera to transfer the light at 555 nm that Rhodamine 6G emits when excited by the

Nd:YAG laser and blocks the laser light at 532 nm diﬀracted by the PIV tracers.

The PLIF calibration procedure follows the method of Crimaldi [8]. The intensity of light

ﬂuoresced by the dye substance IF is directly proportional to its concentration C and the

intensity of light excitation, I, and it is inversely proportional to the ratio of the laser light

intensity and the saturated intensity of the particular dye, Is:

IF ∝ C

I

1 + I/Is

(2)

For carefully constructed experiment the intensity in PLIF images I (cid:28) Is and consequently
the Eq. 3 can be formulated as IF ∝ C I [8]. Thus, the ﬂuorescent light captured on the
imaging sensor at pixel i, j is a function of the pixel location (due to imperfections of imaging

IF (i, j) = α(i, j) C(i, j) I(i, j)

(3)

where α(i, j) is a point-wise calibration coeﬃcient.

The calibration procedure goal is to obtain the calibration coeﬃcient α(i, j). We use

uniform solutions of seven diﬀerent concentrations of Rhodamine 6G with a homogeneous

mixture of Epsom salts, sucrose and water to replicate the experimental conditions. The

pixel-by-pixel, concentration-independent, calibration coeﬃcient, α(i, j) is obtained using an

image processing procedure that is based on: i) a background image obtained as an average

of the ﬁve diﬀerent uniform calibration concentration ﬁelds, I(i, j) ii) the dark response of

the camera obtained using the images with the lens cap covered, B(i, j) and iii) the step-wise

correction scheme of the attenuation coeﬃcient, a(i, j) that integrates attenuation along the

light rays originating from the laser source:

from the work of Ferrier [15], β = 1.1 × 105 (cm M)−1. Constant absorption coeﬃcient

Note that we performed seven calibration runs with monotonically increased concentrations,
but used only ﬁve that refer to the linear part of the ﬁt, in the range of C = 10 ÷ 50µg/L.
The variation of α(i, j) across the image is smaller than 2% for this range, as shown in

Fig. 2(b).

The combination of PIV and PLIF experiments allow for simultaneous measurements

of density and velocity at high spatial resolution. An example of these overlapped data

RESULTS

Evolution of the patch interface

The patch evolution in time is shown from PLIF images in Fig. 4 for diﬀerent time instants

normalised by the stratiﬁcation frequency, N t, and for the representative forcing frequencies

f = 3, 5, and 8 Hz (N t = 0 is the time when the grid starts from rest). For the sake of

clarity, these are not the raw PLIF images. The ﬁrst image (corresponding to the initially

undisturbed concentration ﬁeld of a linear stable stratiﬁed ﬂuid at the dimensionless time

N t=0) was subtracted from raw images. The resulting images are also processed with the

noise low pass ﬁlter, and adjusted for brightness and contrast enhancement.

As depicted in Fig. 4, at early times, individual vortices emanating from the grid appear

(particularly visible for the f = 8 Hz) that rapidly merge and form a uniformly mixed ﬂuid

which moves away from the grid. As time progresses, counter-rotating structures are formed,

pulling ﬂuid inward from the sides at the level of the grid, and ejecting ﬂuid outwards away
from the grid due to baroclinic torque. The patch attains a maximal vertical size at N t ≈ 5.5
for all frequencies, with the patch size growing with increasing the forcing frequency which

is consistent with earlier observations [11, 22, 26, 36].

The turbulent/non-turbulent interface exhibits relatively small undulations. The undu-

lations become much more prominent upon the patch collapse which occurs after the grid is

switched oﬀ at N t = 8. At this late stage, the formation of an intrusive gravity current is

observed. Note that the wave-like features that seem to be radiating away from the turbulent

region are artefacts associated with the imaging and not related to internal gravity waves.

Indeed, the artefacts are visible in the thoroughly mixed and uniform density calibration

images as well and are most likely caused by an optical ﬁlter, which was slightly smaller

than the camera lens.

Raw images like those shown in Fig. 4 are converted into density ﬁelds ρ(x, z, t) through

the PLIF calibration procedure (described in Section ) and transformed into the buoyancy

ﬁelds according to the following relation:

Here it should be noted that density variations are small such that ρ0 − ρ can be interpreted
as a perturbation buoyancy consistent with the Boussinesq approximation.

relatively well-mixed. The TNTI seems to sharpen in time, and undulations of the interface

Spatially averaged description of the patch

In this section we present spatially (horizontally or isopycnally) averaged statistics of the

ﬂow in the quasi-homogeneous region shown in Fig. 4. The spatial averages are denoted by

Note that the results
shown from Fig. 5 onwards will be presented as if the measurements were made above the

grid. This is permitted as the governing equations are invariant under the transformation
{z → −z, w → −w, b → −b}.

The spatially averaged buoyancy proﬁles (cid:104)b(cid:105) as a function of time and z are depicted in
Fig. 6, using the data of all frequencies for several representative time instants. The initial
condition is the background stratiﬁcation given by (cid:104)b(cid:105) = N 2z where N 2 = 1 s−1.

The buoyancy proﬁles (cid:104)b(cid:105) in Fig. 6 can be decomposed into two three distinct regions
according to the slopes: i) inside the patch where the turbulent mixing decreases the strati-

ﬁcation; ii ) the TNTI that develops starting from N t = 2 (dash-dot line) in which the local

values for N 2 are much larger than the background stratiﬁcation, and iii) the background
ambient with the slope close to N 2 ≈ 1 s−1. The TNTI can be seen to move away from
the grid until N t = 5.5 (thick line), indicative of the turbulent entrainment that is taking

place. In this period the TNTI is observed to sharpen, as we demonstrate below. Note that

the values of N 2 inferred from the spatially averaged statistics likely underestimate the local

values, due to the large-scale deformation of the ﬂow near the interface, visible in Fig. 4.

Local analysis across the interface is discussed in Section and it provides better estimates

of the real TNTI interface thickness.

In order to deﬁne the patch size, δ and the interface thickness ∆, we use the notion that
the stratiﬁcation inside the patch is characterized by N 2 ≈ 0.3 s−1 for all forcing frequencies,
and that the background stratiﬁcation is deﬁned by N 2 = 1 s−1 (Fig. 7). The slope across

the interface is approximately 0.65 and it is shown by a middle dashed line in Fig. 7. The
intersection of each averaged proﬁle (cid:104)b(cid:105) with this line (empty circles) is deﬁned here as the
mid-point of the interface and deﬁnes the patch size δ(f, t). Following Craske et al.[7], we

decide to use 25% and 75% of the value at the intersection to mark the upper and the lower

limits of the layer (full symbols) that we call hereinafter the “interface layer”. The distance

between these two limits on the proﬁle serves as an estimate of the interface layer thickness,

∆(f, t). This approach to measure the position and the thickness of the interfacial layer is

relatively robust and much less sensitive to experimental noise than other interface detection

techniques (for instance using ﬁxed thresholds or marking the maximum buoyancy gradient
d(cid:104)b(cid:105) /dz).

Figure 8 presents the results of the patch growth in terms of δ(t), estimated using the

aforementioned method (see Fig. 7) applied to the spatially averaged buoyancy proﬁles,

shown in Fig. 6. The results are shown versus dimensionless time N t, for each frequency.
The patch size grows rapidly until N t ≈ 4 after which the growth rate decreases drastically,
to half of its original value and than the patch grows again until N t ≈ 5.5 and reaches
its maximum size. After that, the patch size declines until N t ≈ 8, the time when the
grid stops. Note that the patch collapses before we stop the motor and the evolution cycle

(transient, initial growth and the maximum size) occur at the same time independent of

the grid frequency. The behaviour of the patch size resembles a step response of a second-

order dynamical system (a pendulum-like motion) with an overshoot type of under-damped

system response for higher frequencies and over-damped behaviour for the lower frequencies.

The curves through the experimental points are best ﬁts of such a solution, emphasizing the

similarity of the behaviour at diﬀerent frequencies.

The inset of Fig. 8 shows the relation between the maximum patch size, δmax(N t = 5.5)

and the forcing frequency, f . A linear trend is discernible, which is consistent with earlier

largest size value is directly proportional to the forcing frequency.

Spatially averaged and turbulent ﬂow statistics

The spatially averaged vertical velocity (cid:104)w(cid:105) is shown in Fig. 9 (a-c) at three instants in
time for the forcing frequencies 3, 5 and 8 Hz. Positive vertical velocity for the ﬁrst two time

instants is indicative of a mean ﬂow away from the grid which is consistent with the observed

counter-rotating rolls at the edges of the grid discernible in Fig. 4. At N t = 5.5, the mean

velocity has changed sign for both the f = 3 and 5 Hz cases, and partly for f = 8 Hz.The

change of sign is due to the presence of well-mixed ﬂuid inside the patch which creates

hydrostatic pressure values larger than the ambient which in turn will cause the formation

of an intrusive gravity current.

In addition to the mean ﬂow we quantify the turbulent
kinetic energy (TKE). The spatially averaged TKE is deﬁned here as k = 1
2 (cid:104)u(cid:48)2 + w(cid:48)2(cid:105)
where u(cid:48) = u−(cid:104)u(cid:105) and v(cid:48) = v−(cid:104)v(cid:105), and it is shown in Fig. 9 (d-f). The TNTI is emphasised
in these ﬁgures by the sharp drop-oﬀ of TKE near the interface. The slope of this decrease

of TKE across the interface layer is increasing with the intensity of the patch forcing which

is in our case with frequency.

Figure 9(d-f) show that the shape of the turbulence proﬁles varies strongly with time.

This means that we cannot use the commonly used ”grid action” description [10, 11, 23],

which assumes that the turbulence generated by the grid can be described by a grid action

parameter K with dimensions L2T−1, implying that k1/2 = Kz−1. The strong temporal

and spatial variations of k are indicative of the absence of any turbulence equilibrium, and

persist due to initial transients of the oscillating grid and stratiﬁcation eﬀects inside the

patch. Instead of the grid-action parameter we deﬁne the level of turbulence according to

Dependence of σu on the forcing frequency f at N t = 5.5 is shown in Fig. 10. The result

shows clearly that the level of velocity ﬂuctuations σu is linearly dependent on the forcing

frequency, consistent with previous studies [10, 11] that used oscillating grids. Note that the

linear relation between σu on frequency is also consistent with the observed linear dependence
of δmax and f . Indeed, based on dimensional arguments, we expect that δ ∼ σu/N , which
upon substituting σu ∼ f results in δ ∼ f /N (see Fig. 8).

Local analysis of entrainment across the interface

Using the interface detection method (presented in Fig. 7) we also estimate the position

of the interface, δ(x, t) as well as the local thickness of the interface, ∆(x, t). In Fig. 11(a)

we demonstrate the buoyancy ﬁeld (as a color map) on which we mark the location of the

interface (solid curve), and the corresponding 25% and 75% of the interface value (dashed

lines). The distance between the two dashed lines is the local thickness of the interface,

∆(x, t).

The values of the interface thickness ∆(x, t), measured at diﬀerent x locations and diﬀer-

ent time instants, are then averaged along x and plotted in Fig. 11(b). It appears that the

thickness of the interface is decreasing with increasing frequency and the interface sharpens
with time, at least until the N t ≈ 5.5 that corresponds to the critical moment when the
growth stops and the patch collapses. It is noteworthy that at this moment, the size of the

patch is maximal and the thickness is minimal. Since the patch is well-mixed, it means that
the patch reaches the largest gradient of buoyancy at this time instant of N t ≈ 5.5. Plotting
the minimal value of (cid:104)∆(cid:105) versus frequency (inset Fig. 11(b)) also results in an approximately
linear dependence of ∆min on f .

We show in the following how the turbulent entrainment is associated with the evolution

of the patch vertical size with time. In the previous section it was shown that there is a
substantial component of the spatially averaged vertical ﬂow (cid:104)w(cid:105) inside the patch, implying
that the propagation of the interface due to turbulent mixing is:

we(t) =(cid:28) dδ

dt(cid:29)δ − (cid:104)w(cid:105)δ

(8)

Subscript δ implies averaging along the interface deﬁned by δ(x, t), according to (cid:104)χ(cid:105)δ ≡
−L/2 χ(x, δ(x), t)dx where χ is the averaged variable. The quantities (cid:104)dδ/dt(cid:105)δ, (cid:104)w(cid:105)δ

and the entrainment velocity we are plotted in Fig. 12a, c, d for all the experiments.

1/L(cid:82) L/2

It seen that we is largely positive as is expected: the turbulence mixing is pushing the

interface outwards as long as the grid is oscillating. In addition, as we remains positive for

all time, the patch collapse must be caused by mean ﬂow eﬀects.

For the sake of local balance, we use a local turbulent velocity scale (cid:104)q(cid:105)δ, where q = k1/2
is the square root of the TKE. The local turbulent velocity scale is shown in Fig. 12b and its

comparison with the entrainment velocity we (Fig. 12d) emphasize some degree of correlation

between these key parameters.

Using the local parameters from Fig. 12, it is possible to extract a local entrainment

which is plotted in Fig. 13a as a function of time for all frequencies. It is observed that E

increases as the forcing frequency is increased. Furthermore, the value of E seems to drop

as time progresses. These large variations are to be expected due to the non-equilibrium

character of turbulence and of particular relevance here is that the value of E is positive
deﬁnite and constrained to the interval E ≤ 0.1.

The entrainment coeﬃcient is typically assumed to be dependent on the Richardson

number Ri in a form of the entrainment law, E = E(Ri) [14]. The deﬁnition of Ri vary

from one ﬂow type to another[14]. The initial growth of a localised patch under consideration

does not support such an entrainment law, which is not surprising as this problem features

large non-equilibrium eﬀects both in the mean ﬂow and the turbulence. Nevertheless, it is

instructive to calculate a local gradient Richardson number deﬁned as:

From the data shown in Fig. 13a it is evident that the values of Rig at the interface are of the
order of O(102), implying that the turbulence is strongly suppressed in the vertical direction.
Among the diﬀerent runs, the values of Rig for the f = 3 Hz experiment are the highest. This

may be counter-intuitive, as one would expect that lower forcing would produce interfaces

that are less sharp; however, in this case, it is (dq/dz)2 which becomes small at the TNTI

much quicker than (db/dz). It is diﬃcult to conclude about Rig dependence on frequency,

although it seems that the value of Rig stays fairly constant as a function of time and does

not vary strongly with f .

We have performed simultaneous PIV and PLIF experiments in a localized turbulent

patch, freely developing far from the walls in a stably stratiﬁed environment. Consistent

with previous studies we observe that the patch vertical size, δ(t), initially grows rapidly,

then reaches a maximum, followed by a collapse and subsequent equilibrium through the
formation of a gravity current. The time it takes to reach the maximum size is N t ≈ 5.5,
independent of frequency, whilst the patch growth rate changes drastically at N t ≈ 4.

The focus of this paper is on the early transients of the patch that occur before the

quasi-steady state occurs, i.e. N t < 8. The measurements reveal signiﬁcant large-scale ﬂow

features in the form to counter-rotating vortices on the lateral patch edges after the grid was

switched on, which are both visible directly in the buoyancy ﬁeld (Fig. 4) and indirectly in

the form of a mean velocity away from the grid in the central area of the patch (Fig. 12c).

The turbulence intensity inside the turbulent patch is large, exceeding the mean ﬂow for

all frequencies. Near the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, turbulent levels dropped oﬀ

rapidly, whilst the mean ﬂow components extend beyond the turbulent region.

The data reveal strong non-equilibrium behaviour both for the mean ﬂow and the tur-

bulence. This implies that the concept of grid action, commonly used to characterise the

turbulence intensity for oscillating grids, is not valid for the early dynamics analysis of a

localised patch. Other factors that may be contributing are the stratiﬁcation inside the

patch and the fact that the patch is typically not large enough to reach the several mesh

sizes required to establish a behaviour consistent with the grid action concept.

A good indicator for the turbulence level inside the patch, σu is deﬁned in this work
based on the spatial average inside the well-mixed region. It is found that σu at N t ≈ 5.5 is
directly proportional to the grid forcing frequency, f , in agreement with previous studies.

The local analysis at the interface is carried out, revealing to what extent the TNTI

propagates by advection due to the mean ﬂow and to what extent by turbulence and tur-

bulent entrainment across the interface.
It is observed that advection by the mean ﬂow
is the process responsible for the sign reversal in dδ/dt after N t ≈ 5.5 and the following
collapse. Importantly, the entrainment velocity remains positive as turbulence consistently

causes outward propagation of the interface due to turbulent mixing. The values of the en-
trainment rate E are found to be constrained to E ≤ 0.1. The gradient Richardson number

22

Rig at the interface is rather high, O(102), implying that suppression of the vertical turbu-
lence components are signiﬁcant due to very sharp interface and extremely strong buoyancy

gradient across the interface.
