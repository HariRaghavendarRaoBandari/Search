Short Wavelength Oscillations with Right-Handed

Neutrinos

E. A. Paschos∗

Department of Physics, TU Dortmund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany

Abstract

The standard model is extended with three right-handed, singlet neutrinos

with general couplings permitted by the SU(2)L × U(1) symmetry. The tra-

ditional oscillations are accounted for, as usually, by three left-handed neu-

trinos. The article investigates new structures that develop when the masses

of the right-handed states are in the eV range. The new states interfere and

oscillate with the standard light neutrinos. New structures appear when the

detectors average over short wavelengths. I use these results to present and

classify properties of the observed anomalies in the MiniBooNe, reactor and

Gallium-detector experiments.

1. General Introduction

Among the anomalies in particle physics three were reported in neutrino

oscillation experiments. The ﬁrst appears in the LSND experiment [1, 2]

which was not conﬁrmed by the MiniBooNe results, but new discrepancies

appeared in antineutrino reactions [3]. The second occurs in reactor experi-

ments where the observed ﬂuxes of neutrinos at a distance of ∼100 meters are

smaller than those expected from the energy produced by the reactors [4, 5].

Finally, the third anomaly appeared when an intense radioactive source was

placed inside the Gallium detectors. These radioactive nuclei decay through

electron capture, emitting νe at energies of 1 MeV. The emitted neutrinos

have been detected and they show a deﬁcit [6].

The traditional explanation is the introduction of one or two sterile neu-

trinos which explain some of the anomalies. The natural way, however, is to

introduce one additional right-handed state to each generation and study the

consequences. The presence of three states introduces a larger mixing matrix

with possible new phenomena. In this article I introduce three right-handed

neutrinos – one for each generation – with all possible Dirac and Majorana

couplings

After diagonalization the mass eigenstates are superposition of νL and

with φ1 = νL cos θ − N C

R sin θ and φ2 = νL sin θ + N C

R cos θ, etc.

For sterile neutrinos, the bounds on their masses are weak and I will se-

lect them to be in the eV mass range. Oscillations to these heavier states

inﬂuence the detection possibilities. A second criterion deals with the nec-

essary conditions for coherence. One condition requires the neutrino source

to be localized within a region smaller than the oscillation length [7, 8, 9].

Similarly, the resolution of the detectors must be smaller than the oscillation

length; otherwise, we do not observe the undulation of the waves but an

average value integrated over several wavelengths.

In the following sections I describe and classify the solutions for the mass

matrix in equation (4).

It is assumed the mD ≪ M and for simplicity,

I restrict the analysis to two ﬂavors: the left-handed states are νe and νµ

and the heavier right-handed states will be denoted by Ne and Nµ. The

mass and energy scales may be diﬀerent and lead to various cases. We may

have the mixing of two states which are light relative to the energy of the

beam. This is the traditional case where the observed oscillations have been

3

explained in terms of three light left-handed neutrinos. I will assume that

the complete left-handed sector accounts for solar, atmospheric and LBL

oscillations. Then I will describe new observables introduced by the right-

handed sector. The new observables involve the mixing between light and

heavy states and ﬁnally the oscillations between two heavy states.

In the

mixing of light with heavier states the energy diﬀerence El − Eh can be

very large producing a short wavelength, so that an average over several

wavelengths is required. We discuss several cases and point out properties

that are relevant for experiments. The above properties are present in the

case of two or three ﬂavors and for simplicity the analysis is restricted to two

ﬂavors where the algebra is simpler and transparent.

It is easy to show that the matrix which diagonalizes the mass matrix
is unitary to order (mD/M)4, a property that allows one to use standard

formulas for appearance and disappearance probabilities. The general struc-

ture of the mass matrix is dictated by the symmetry properties of the theory

without introducing restrictions for the scale of the masses. Choosing a rela-

tive small Majorana mass relates the mass matrix to low energy phenomena,

but brings the disadvantage that one loses an elegant explanation for the

very small neutrino masses. The present experimental results do not rule

out small masses and I will present general consequences.

Sterile neutrinos with relative small masses are popular and there are

extensive reviews [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Among the articles that identify them

with Majorana neutrinos there is the so called eV-seesaw mechanism with

a mass for the right-handed neutrinos in the eV scale [15, 16]. This model

was introduced to account for the LSND anomaly and was further developed

4

proposing testable predictions [17, 18]. There is also an early review with

Dirac and Majorana mass terms with the remark that whenever the reso-

lution of the detectors is large compared to the oscillation length, then the

apparatus records an average value of the oscillation [19].

The plan of the article is a follows.

In section 2.

I present a general

formalism with extensive details and compute the survival probability for a

νe beam. Section 3. describes the appearance probabilities. A classiﬁcation

of the three types of terms in the transition probability is presented in the

last section with brief remarks of their implications to other experiments.

2. Analysis

We seek solutions in the case where the elements of mD are small relative

to those of M so that perturbative solutions are possible. The unitary matrix

which diagonalizes the mass matrix is

with similar equations for the coeﬃcients of the other states. The unitarity

of the matrices leads to universality relations, like

|Uei|2 = 1 + O(J 4)

(12)

4Xi=1

which guarantees that the initial lepton-ﬂavor states have an overall strength

determined by the Fermi coupling constant. Unitarity bounds for the matrix

element are collected in the review [20]. As the states develop in time the

original ﬂavor state diminishes, feeding into the development of states with

other ﬂavors.

The experiments produce neutrinos of speciﬁc lepton ﬂavor which then

develop according to their mass eigenstates. For the time development we

can start with equation (8) which we invert in order to express νe(t), νµ(t),

Ne(t) and Nµ(t) in terms of the mass eigenstates φi(t). Then returning to

equation (8) we can express φi(0)’s in terms of νe(0), . . . ,NRµ(0) being the

states produced at time t = 0. Thus for the development of electron type

neutrinos we obtain

The ellipses denote terms in the development of |νe(t)i from other initial

states. In the limit J → 0 the ﬁrst two terms that survive have the structure

for the two family case. The generalized form includes additional terms from

heavier states. The same steps also give the development of a |νµ(t)i from

an initial |νe(0)i state

Again it is straightforward to compute the ellipses as well as formulas for

the development of the two sterile states |Ne(t)i and |Nµ(t)i. The energies

E1, . . . ,E4 correspond to the mass eigenstates φ1, . . . ,φ4, respectively, and

even though φ3 and φ4 may be heavier they appear in the |νe(t)i and |νµ(t)i

wave functions, but as smaller components. The presence of Majorana states

inﬂuences the oscillation experiments and also neutrinoless double β-decay.

The contributions of the ﬂavor matrix in equations (5) and (7) satisfy

unitary to O(J 4). This property permits the derivation of general expressions

for the transition probabilities similar to those obtained in the traditional

cases. The transition probability [21, 22] that an original neutrino of ﬂavor

α to be observed as ﬂavor β is

Pα→α = 1 − 4Xi<j

t(cid:19) .

(16)

In these general formulas the mass and energy values are diﬀerent and

it may not be possible to expand the energies in all terms in the relativistic

limit. For this reason I kept the energies in the arguments of the trigonomet-

ric functions.

For the surviving probability the oscillation between the two light neu-

trinos has the frequency

∆m2
12
4E

which for distances of a few kilometers or

shorter produces a small modulation. For the heavier Majorana states,

therms (E1 − E3) and (E1 − E4) can be large producing an oscillation with

short wavelengths which requires the averaging over several wave lengths

giving an overall factor 1/2. The result after averaging over the wavelengths

is

There are two corrections of O(J 2) and the last term is O(J 4) which is

2

(17)

smaller. The correction to the ∆m12 − term will be hard to observe, because,

as we mentioned, at the short distances sin2(cid:18)∆m2

4E (cid:19) is very small. The

term −2 (|J11|2 + |J12|2) is obtained by averaging over several wavelengths

12L

and manifests itself as a decrease of the initial ﬂux of neutrinos.

It is a

candidate for the reactor and Gallium discrepancy. Assigning the decrease of

the reactor ﬂuxes to the term −2 (|J11|2 + |J12|2) implies that one of |J11| or

10

|J12| or both are approximately ∼ 0.2. This range of small parameters will be

useful for estimating the appearance probabilities of νe’s in the MiniBooNe

experiments.

The last term in equation (17) contains the energy diﬀerence (E3 − E4)t.

When the masses are diﬀerent from each other and heavier than the energy

of the beam an averaging over wavelengths is again necessary producing an

additional reduction of O(J 4). When the masses are comparable M3 ≈ M4

the wave length can be long, introducing a modulation on top of the surviving

probability.

In summary, the presence of heavier neutrinos produces new

eﬀects in oscillation experiments. They manifest themselves as a reduction

of the surviving probability and/or a modulation on top of the traditional

oscillation.

3. Appearance Probabilities

For the experiments the relevant parameters are the masses of the neu-

trinos, the energy of the beam and the mixing angles. A general property is

that small mass diﬀerence of neutrinos produce oscillations with long wave-

lengths. For masses and mass diﬀerences comparable to the energies the

oscillation lengths become small so that the experiments measure rates av-

eraged over several wavelengths. For active neutrinos there are stringent

bounds on their masses but for sterile there is still a large range allowed. For

the latter we will consider masses up to 10 eV. The available neutrino beams

for reactor experiments are ≈ 8 MeV and for accelerator experiments are a

few hundred MeV. In these experiments the neutrino states that we consider

are relativistic, so that the functional form

is justiﬁed.

For the experiments [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] there are kinematic regions where

the wavelength of the oscillation is comparable to the resolution length of

the experiments. For ∆m2 = 1 eV2 and neutrino energy of ∼ 100 MeV, the

distance L ≈ 1 km contains 2 wavelengths and for ∆m2 = 10 eV2 contains 20

oscillations. For small mass diﬀerences we use the wave nature of the oscilla-

tion and for large mass diﬀerences one must average over many oscillations.

In the following we consider both ranges.

The appearance probability was given in equation (15) from which we

can distinguish three cases.

Case (1) includes only light neutrinos with i = 1 and j = 2 producing the

transition

(19)

Here L is the distance where the detector is located. For distances less

than 100 meters the small value of ∆12 generates very few νe and we kept

only the leading term of the mixing matrix which is real.

Case (2) involves contributions from two light neutrinos to heavy states

with i = (1 or 2) and j = (3 or 4). The masses of the light states are very

small and we approximate ∆ij ≈ −m2

j = ∆j. The appearance probability is

In this expression the unitarity of the mixing matrix eliminates the leading

2(cid:2)(JJ †)21 + (JJ †)12(cid:3)

(21)

which is second order on the parameter J. The second multiplicative fac-

tor in equation (20) is also O(J 2) which makes the eﬀects small. Adopting

the value for the element Jij ∼ 0.2 then 4(Jij)4 = 0.0064 which is the pre-

ferred value by the MiniBooNe Collaboration [3]. For the mass parameters

∆13, . . . ∆24 there is a lot of freedom and can be chosen to produce appro-

priate sinusoidal distribution. Alternatively the masses m3 and m4 can be

selected to be heavy enough so that an average over several wavelengths is

justiﬁed.

When we go a step further and consider the masses m3 and m4 heavy

enough so that an average over several wavelengths is justiﬁed, then the

expression for the appearance probability further simpliﬁes

µ→e = 2|Uµ3U ∗

(22)

The absence of the imaginary term from equation (20) follows from the

averaging over the length of the detector and also from the fact that the

mixing elements appear as an absolute value. Thus for the appearance of

13

νe’s there are two possibilities. In the ﬁrst one the two wavelengths can be

chosen appropriately to accommodate experimental data and in the second

the wavelengths are very short producing a mean number of νe’s from the

oscillation.

Finally case (3) originates from the interference of two heavy intermedi-

ate states. This is sensitive to the phase between the matrix elements and

includes the CP-phases. I deﬁne

φ34 = arg[Uµ3U ∗

and obtain the appearance probability

(23)

The masses m3 and m4 are large but we do not know how close they are

to each other. Thus they provide one more wavelength. In general there are

three wavelengths accounting for the data.

4. Summary

The article investigated theories with Dirac and Majorana mass terms

including all terms allowed by the symmetries of the standard model. We

selected low Majorana masses in order to correlate the consequences with

low energy phenomena. The results have the following features.

1. The mixing among the light states produces the observed, (atmospheric

and solar) oscillations. The standard analysis with three left-handed light

neutrinos can be repeated.

14

2. The mixing of light with the heavy states originates from the middle

values in the summations of equations (15) and (16). Using the unitarity we

can show that they depend on the mixing elements of the heavy states. For

short wavelengths they do not include CP-violating eﬀects.

3. At the end of the summation there are two heavier states which in-

terfere with each other. If the mass diﬀerence between them is very small

then the oscillation has a very long wavelength (LBL). Moderate values for

the mass diﬀerence produces oscillations accessible to short baseline experi-

ments. I formulated the discussion for two families but the arguments rely

on the unitarity of the mixing matrix and the separation into the three cases

applies to models with more families.

The existence of massive neutrinos with masses in the eV region can be

investigated in other experiments. There is a group of experiments looking

directly for neutrino masses. They investigate the end-point of the Curie-plot

which is sensitive to the incoherent sum [23, 24, 25]

mβ =sXi

|Uei|2m2
i

(24)

where the new masses contribute. A second possibility are contributions

to neutrinoless double beta decay [26, 27].

In this process the new Ma-

jorana states appear as intermediate states but they are lighter than the

momentum ﬂowing through the propagator (the momentum in propagator is

∼ 100 MeV). The decay rate now depends on the eﬀective mass [15, 26, 27, 28]

where D is the diagonal mass matrix in equation (6). In the see-saw mecha-

(25)

hmeei =(cid:0)UDU T(cid:1)ee = 0

15

nism the masses are correlated and give vanishing values. This is a diﬀerence

between the eV-seesaw mechanism [15] and models with one or two strile

neutrinos [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] where the masses are unconstrained and a small

value for hmeei is possible.

Finally, there is a cosmological bound for the sum of the masses of neu-

trinos which is close to the masses I discussed.
