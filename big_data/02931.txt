Deformations of spectral triples via compact quantum group

monoidal equivalences

Liebrecht De Sadeleer

Department of Mathematics, KU Leuven∗

Abstract

In this paper, we propose a new procedure to deform spectral triples. The deformation data are
a spectral triple (A, H, D), a compact quantum group G acting algebraically and by orientation-
preserving isometries on (A, H, D) and a unitary ﬁber functor ψ on G. The deformation procedure
is a genuine generalization of the cocycle deformation of Goswami and Joardar.

Introduction

An important source of examples of non-commutative manifolds in the sense of A. Connes (spectral
triples, [8]) relies on 2-cocycle deformations. For instance, the so-called ‘isospectral deformations’
([9]) of compact spin manifolds admitting an action of a torus (or an action of the abelian group Rd )

may be seen as a by-product of Rieﬀel’s machinery which, given a C∗- or Fr´echet-algebra A which
Rd acts on, produces a one-parameter continuous deformation ﬁeld {Aθ}θ∈R of C∗-algebras where
A0 = A. The cocycle involved in this case being the usual Moyal 2-cocycle in Rd . When A induces
a spectral triple (A,H, D) on which Rd acts by isometries, Rieﬀel machinery produces a new (family
of) spectral triple(s) (Aθ,H, D). The paradigm there consists in the noncommutative torus within
its metric version.

In this present work, we generalize the deformation procedure through quantum group 2-cocycles
(Goswami-Joardar, [13]) which is a way to produce spectral triples from a given one. Our procedure
is based on the notion of monoidal equivalence (introduced by de Rijdt, Vaes and Bichon, [6]) of
(some subgroup of) its quantum isometry group ([12]). The generalized procedure here leads to
examples that cannot be obtained by 2-cocycle deformations.

This paper is structured as follows. In the ﬁrst section we describe the deformation procedure after
having recalled the main notions. In the second section we show that 2-cocycle deformation amounts
to our deformation in some particular cases. Finally in the last section, we give an example of our
deformation procedure which is not a 2-cocycle deformation, proving our procedure is a genuine gen-
eralization.

Before we end this introduction, we will clarify some notation. For a Hilbert space H, we will denote
by B(H),K(H) the bounded resp. compact operators on H. For a bounded or unbounded operator
If A is a C∗-algebra, the multiplier algebra of A will be
D on H, σ(D) will be the spectrum of D.
denoted by M(A). For a subset B of a C∗-algebra A, we deﬁne hBi to be the linear span of B
and [B] the closed linear span. Furthermore, we use ωξ,η to denote the linear functional which maps
a ∈ B(H) to hξ, aηi where ξ, η ∈ H, having linearity in the inner product in the second variable.

An algebraic tensor product is denoted by ⊙ while the minimal C∗-algebraic tensor product and a
tensor product of Hilbert spaces is denoted by ⊗. We will also use the legnumbering notation in
for a ∈ A ⊗ A, we let a12 = a ⊗ 1A, a23 = 1A ⊗ a23 and
three and multiple tensor products:
a13 = (id⊗τ )(a ⊗ 1A), all three elements in A ⊗ A ⊗ A where τ (a ⊗ b) = b ⊗ a.

For a Hopf algebra H, the coproduct, counit and antipode will be denoted by ∆, ε and S resp. We
also use the Sweedler notation ∆(h) = h(1) ⊗ h(2). A left, resp. right H-comodule is a vector space
A endowed with a linear map α : A → H ⊙ A resp. α : A → A ⊙ H satisfying (∆ ⊗ id)α = (id⊗α)α
resp. (α ⊗ id)α = (id⊗∆)α. If A is an algebra and α is multiplicative, it is called a coaction of H on
A and A is called an H-comodule algebra. If A and B are a right resp. left H-comodule algebra with
resp. coactions α and β, A ⊠
H

B will denote the algebra {z ∈ A ⊙ B|(α ⊗ id)(z) = (id⊗β)(z)}.

1 Compact quantum groups and Monoidal equivalences

We start this section with a short overview of the theory of compact quantum groups. The theory is
essentially developed in [23], [25] and also explained in [14].

1.1 Compact quantum groups and representations

Deﬁnition 1.1 ([25]). A compact quantum group G is a pair (C(G), ∆) where C(G) is a unital,
seperable C∗-algebra and ∆ : C(G) → C(G) ⊗ C(G) a unital ∗-morphism such that

2

1. (∆ ⊗ id)∆ = (id⊗∆)∆
2. [∆(C(G))(C(G) ⊗ 1)] = C(G) ⊗ C(G) = [∆(C(G))(1 ⊗ C(G))]
implementing coassociativity and the cancellation properties.
Moreover there exists a unique state h on C(G) which is left and right invariant in the sense that
(id⊗h)∆(x) = h(x)1C(G) = (h ⊗ id)∆(x) for all x ∈ C(G) ([23, 25, 14]).This state is called the Haar
state of G. In the classical case that C(G) = C(G) for a classical compact group G, the Haar state
is the state on C(G) obtained by integrating along the Haar measure.

It is well known that, like compact groups, compact quantum groups have a rich representation
theory ([23, 25, 14]). A unitary representation of a compact quantum group G = (C(G), ∆) on a
Hilbert space H is a unitary element U of M(K(H) ⊗ C(G)) satisfying (id⊗∆)U = U12U13. The
dimension of H is called the dimension of the representation.
Identifying M(K(H) ⊗ C(G)) with
B(H ⊗ C(G)), the C∗-algebra of C(G)-linear adjointable maps on the Hilbert-C∗-module H ⊗ C(G),
we will also see representations as maps u : H → H ⊗ C(G) : ξ → U(ξ ⊗ 1C(G)) satisfying that
hu(ξ), u(η)iC(G) = hξ, ηi1C(G), (u⊗id)u = (id⊗∆)u and [u(ξ)(1⊗a) : ξ ∈ H, a ∈ C(G)] = H⊗C(G).
Moreover, there is the notion of tensor product of representations: if U and V are representations
of a quantum group G = (C(G), ∆) on Hilbert spaces H,K respectively, the tensor product U ⊗ V of
U and V is deﬁned as U⊗V = U13V23 ∈ M(K(H⊗K)⊗C(G)). Furthermore, we call a representation
U of G on H irreducible if Mor(U, U) = C1B(H) where

Mor(U 1, U 2) := {S ∈ B(H2,H1)|(S ⊗ 1C(G))U 2 = U 1(S ⊗ 1C(G))}

for representations U1 and U2 on H1 resp. H2. An important result states that every irreducible
representation is ﬁnite dimensional and that every unitary representation is unitarily equivalent to a
direct sum of ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations. Finally, for every irreducible unitary rep-
resentations, there exist the notion of contragredient representation ([25],[14]).

For a compact quantum group G, we denote by Irred(G) the set of equivalence classes of irreducible
representations of G and for x ∈ Irred(G), we will always take a unitary representative U x ∈ B(Hx )⊗
C(G). By ε, we will denote the class of the trivial representation 1C(G).

Also for a compact quantum group G = (C(G), ∆) and an equivalence class x ∈ Irred(G), we will
denote by (ωξ,η ⊗ idC(G))U x a matrix coeﬃcient where ξ, η ∈ H and deﬁne C(G) to be the linear span
of matrix coeﬃcients of all irreducible (hence ﬁnite dimensional) representations of G:

C(G) = h(ωξ,η ⊗ idC(G))U x|x ∈ Irred(G), ξ, η ∈ Hxi,

even more, the matrix coeﬃcients of the irreducible representations form a basis of C(G). Note that
C(G) is a unital dense ∗-subalgebra of C(G) which has, endowed with the restriction of ∆ to C(G), the
structure of a Hopf ∗-algebra. This is a very nontrivial result obtained in [25], see also [14]. Also, for a
x ∈ Irred(G), let C(G)x = h(ωξ,η ⊗ idC(G))U x|ξ, η ∈ Hxi. Then we have ∆ : C(G)x → C(G)x ⊙ C(G)x
and C(G)∗
Deﬁnition 1.2 ([3]). Let G be a compact quantum group. The reduced C∗-algebra Cr (G) is deﬁned
as the norm closure of C(G) in the GNS-representation with respect to the Haar state h of G.The
universal C∗-algebra Cu(G) is deﬁned as the C∗-envelope of C(G). Note that if G is the dual of a
discrete (classical) group Γ, we have Cr (G) = C∗

x = C(G)x .

r ed (Γ), Cu(G) = C∗

u (Γ).

Remark 1.3. Note that, for a given compact quantum group G, we have surjective morphisms
between the diﬀerent completions of C(G): Cu(G) → C(G) → Cr (G). In fact, they can be viewed

3

as diﬀerent versions of the compact quantum group. Therefore, we will identify all quantum groups
with the same underlying Hopf-∗-algebra.

Deﬁnition 1.4 ([14]). Let G be a compact quantum group. Let

c0( ˆG) = ⊕x ∈Irred(G)B(Hx ),

ℓ∞( ˆG) = Yx ∈Irred(G)

B(Hx ).

Then we call ˆG the dual quantum group which has the structure of a discrete quantum group (see
[19] for the deﬁnition and results).

Using the notation V = ⊕x ∈Irred(G)U x , we can deﬁne the dual comultiplication

ˆ∆ : ℓ∞( ˆG) → ℓ∞( ˆG)⊗ℓ∞( ˆG) : (ˆ∆ ⊗ id)(V) = V13V23.

1.2 Actions of compact quantum groups and the spectral subalgebra

Deﬁnition 1.5 ([17]). Let B be a unital C∗-algebra and G = (C(G), ∆) a compact quantum group.
A right action of G on B is a unital ∗-homomorphism β : B → B ⊗ C(G) such that

1. (β ⊗ idC(G))β = (idB ⊗∆)β
2. [β(B)(1 ⊗ C(G))] = B ⊗ C(G).

Analogously, a left action is a unital ∗-morphism β′
conditions. We say the the action is ergodic if Bβ = {b ∈ B|β(b) = b ⊗ 1} = C1B.

: B → C(G) ⊗ B satisfying the analogous

One can prove that in the case of ergodic actions, there is a unique invariant state on B ([7]),

which we will denote by ω.

Note that the most evident example is a quantum group acting on itself by comultiplication. In

that situation, one can check that ω = h.

Using the intimate link between the ergodic action of a compact quantum group on a unital

C∗-algebra and the representations of the quantum group, one has the following result.
Proposition 1.6 ([7]). Let B be a untial C∗-algebra and β : B → B ⊗ C(G) an action of G on B.
Then there exists a dense unital ∗-subalgebra B of B which we will call the spectral subalgebra of B
with respect to β. Moreover β|B is an algebraic coaction of the Hopf ∗-algebra (C(G), ∆) on B.
Remark 1.7. An action β : B → B ⊗ C(G) of G on B is called universal if B is the universal C∗-
It is called reduced if the map (id⊗h)β : B → B onto the ﬁxed point algebra Bβ is
algebra of B.
faithful.
Note that in remark 1.3, we saw that a compact quantum group has diﬀerent C∗-versions with
the same underlying Hopf ∗-algebra. This remark is also valid here: we have surjective morphisms:
Bu → B → Br for an action β : B → B ⊗ C(G) of G on B. So again, we will identify two actions if
the underlying Hopf ∗-algebras are the same.

1.3 Monoidal equivalences between compact quantum groups

Deﬁnition 1.8 ([6]). Let G1 = (C(G1), ∆1) and G2 = (C(G2), ∆2) be two compact quantum groups.
G1 and G2 are called monoidally equivalent if there exists a bijection ϕ : Irred(G1) → Irred(G2) which
satisﬁes ϕ(εG1) = εG2 together with linear isomorphisms:

ϕ : Mor(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xr , y1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ yk )

→ Mor(ϕ(x1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ ϕ(xr ), ϕ(y1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ ϕ(yk ))

4

satisfying

ϕ(1) = 1,

ϕ(S∗) = ϕ(S)∗,

ϕ(S ⊗ T ) = ϕ(S) ⊗ ϕ(T ),
ϕ(ST ) = ϕ(S)ϕ(T )

(1.1)

whenever the formulas make sense. The collection of maps is called a monoidal equivalence.

Deﬁnition 1.9 ([6]). Let G = (C(G), ∆) be a compact quantum group. A unitary ﬁber functor is a
collection of maps ψ such that

• for every x ∈ Irred(G), there is a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space Hψ(x ),
• there are linear maps

ψ : Mor(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xk , y1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ys )

→ B(Hψ(y1 ) ⊗ . . . ⊗ Hψ(ys ),Hψ(x1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ Hψ(xk ))

(1.2)

which satisfy the equations (1.1) of deﬁnition 1.8.

Remark 1.10 ([6]). To deﬁne a unitary ﬁber functor it suﬃces to attach to every x ∈ Irred(G) a
ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space Hψ(x )(Hε = C) and to deﬁne the linear maps

ψ : Mor(x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xk , y ) → B(Hψ(y ),Hψ(x1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ Hψ(xk ))

for k = 1, 2, 3 satsifying

ψ(1) = 1
ψ(S)∗ψ(T ) = ψ(S∗T )
(ψ(S) ⊗ id)ψ(T ) = ψ((S ⊗ id)T )
(id⊗ψ(S))ψ(T ) = ψ((id⊗S)T )

if S ∈ Mor(x ⊗ y , a), T ∈ Mor(x ⊗ y , b)
if S ∈ Mor(x ⊗ y , a), T ∈ Mor(a ⊗ z, b)
if S ∈ Mor(x ⊗ y , a), T ∈ Mor(a ⊗ z, b)

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

together with a non-degenerateness condition

[ψ(S)ξ|a ∈ Irred(G), S ∈ Mor(b ⊗ c, a), ξ ∈ Hψ(a)] = Hψ(b) ⊗ Hψ(c)

In fact, the notions of unitary ﬁber functor and monoidal equivalence are equivalent, which is

stated in the following proposition, taken from Proposition 3.12 in [6].

Proposition 1.11. Let G1 be a compact quantum group and ψ a unitary ﬁber functor on it. Then
there exist a unique universal compact quantum group G2 with underlying Hopf algebra (C(G2), ∆2)
with unitary representations U ψ(x ) ∈ B(Hψ(x )) ⊗ C(G2), x ∈ Irred(G1) such that

1. U ψ(y )

13 U ψ(z )

23

(ψ(S) ⊗ 1) = (ψ(S) ⊗ 1)U ψ(x ) for all S ∈ Mor(y ⊗ z, x),

2. the matrix coeﬃcients of the U ψ(x ), x ∈ Irred(G1) form a linear basis of C(G2).

Moreover, the set {U ψ(x )|x ∈ G1} forms a complete set of irreducible representations of G2 and the
unitary ﬁber functor ψ on G1 will induce a monoidal equivalence ϕ : G1 → G2.

The following theorems of De Rijdt et al. will be crucial in our main result. They explain what

extra structure a monoidal equivalence induces.

The ﬁrst theorem follows from Theorem 3.9 and Proposition 3.13 of [6].

5

Theorem 1.12 ([6]). 1 Let G1 be a compact quantum groups and let ψ be a unitary ﬁber functor on
G1. Denote with ϕ : G1 → G2 the monoidal equivalence induced by ψ (see previous proposition).

1. There exists a unique unital ∗-algebra B equipped with a faithful state ω and unitary elements

13X z

X x ∈ B(Hϕ(x ),Hx ) ⊙ B for all x ∈ Irred(G1) satisfying
(a) X y
23(ϕ(S) ⊗ 1) = (S ⊗ 1)X x for all S ∈ Mor(y ⊗ z, x),
(b) the matrix coeﬃcients of the X x form a linear basis of B,
(c) (id⊗ω)(X x) = 0 if x 6= ε.

2. There exist unique commuting actions β2 : B → B ⊙ C(G2) and β1 : B → C(G1) ⊙ B satisfying

(id⊗β2)(X x ) = X x

12U ϕ(x )

13

and

(id⊗β1)(X x ) = U x

12X x
13

for all x ∈ Irred(G). Moreover, ω(b)1B = (h ⊗ idB)β1(b).

3. The state ω is invariant under β1 and β2. Denoting by Br ed the C∗-algebra generated by B
in the GNS-representation associated with ω and denoting by Bu the universal enveloping C∗-
algebra of B, the actions β1 and β2 admit unique extensions to actions on Br ed , resp. Bu.
These actions are reduced, resp. universal and they are ergodic and of full quantum multiplicity
(see [6] for the deﬁnition).

Deﬁnition 1.13. In what follows, we will call B the G1 − G2-bi-Galois object associated with ϕ.

In the spirit of this theorem, we can introduce the notion of isomorphism of unitary ﬁber functors,

which will be equivalent to the isomorphism of the associated bi-Galois objects.

Deﬁnition 1.14 (Def. 3.10 in [6]). Let ψ and ψ′ be two unitary ﬁber functors on a compact quantum
group G. We say they are isomorphic if there exist unitaries ux ∈ B(Hϕ(x ),Hψ(x )) such that

ψ′(S) = (uy1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ uyk )ψ(S)(u∗

x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ u∗
xr )

for all S ∈ Mor(y1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ yk , x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xr ).
Proposition 1.15. Let ψ and ψ′ be two unitary ﬁber functors on a compact quantum group G. Let
ψ. Then ψ and ψ′ are
Bψ′ and Bψ be the associated bi-Galois objects with respective coactions βψ, β′
isomorphic as unitary ﬁber functors if and only if there exists a ∗-isomorphism λ : Bψ → Bψ′ satisfying
(λ ⊗ id)βψ = βψ′ λ.

There is even more, De Rijdt and Vander Vennet proved in [11] that there exists a bijection
between actions of monoidal equivalent compact quantum groups.
Indeed, let G1 and G2 be two
compact quantum groups, ϕ : G1 → G2 be a monoidal equivalence between them. Let B, β1, β2, X x
be as in the previous theorem. Suppose moreover that we have a C∗-algebra D1 and an action
α1 : D1 → D1 ⊗ C(G1) of G1 on D1. Using the dense Hopf ∗-algebras, we have a coaction
α1 : D1 → D1 ⊙ C(G1) of C(G1) on D1 and we can deﬁne the ∗-algebra:

D2 = D1 ⊡

C(G1) B = {a ∈ D1 ⊙ B|(α1 ⊗ idB)(a) = (idD1 ⊗β1)(a)}.

Moreover, in [11], the authors prove that the same construction with the inverse monoidal equivalence
ϕ−1 will give D1 again.

1In the original statement of Ann De Rijdt, de action β1 is a right action of G1, but for what follows, we want a left
action of G1 and a right action of G2. Applying De Rijdt’s theorem on the inverse monoidal equivalence ϕ′ : G2 → G1,
one gets the theorem stated here. Note that, when doing that, we should write Xϕ(x), x ∈ Irred(G1) but for notational
convenience, we write Xx , x ∈ Irred(G1).

on D2. Moreover, if

Before we start with the description of the deformation procedure, we recapitulate the notion of

spectral triples and that of CQG acting on spectral triples.

Deﬁnition 1.17 ([8]). A (compact) spectral triple (A,H, D) consists of

1. a ∗-algebra A∞ acting as bounded operators on H,
2. a Hilbert space H,
3. an unbounded selfadjoint operator D on H with compact resolvent such that [D, a] is bounded

for all a ∈ A.

Deﬁnition 1.18 ([8]). Two spectral triples (A1,H1, D1) and (A2,H2, D2) are called isomorphic,
if there exists an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces φ : H1 → H2 and an isomorphism of ∗-algebras
λ : A1 → A2 such that φD1 = D2φ and φ(aξ) = λ(a)φ(ξ) for arbitrary ξ ∈ H1, a ∈ A1.

In [4, 12] Bhowmick and Goswami described how compact quantum groups can act isometrically

and orientation-preserving on a non-commutative manifold, i.e. a spectral triple.

Deﬁnition 1.19 ([4]). Let (A,H, D) be a compact spectral triple, G = (C(G), ∆) a compact quantum
group and U a unitary representation of G on H. Then G is said to act by orientation-preserving
isometries on (A,H, D) with U if

• for every state φ on M, we have UφD = DUφ where Uφ := (id⊗φ)(U),
• (id⊗φ) ◦ αU (a) ∈ A′′ for all a ∈ A and state φ on M; where αU (T ) := U(T ⊗ 1)U ∗ for

T ∈ B(H).

In our opinion this deﬁnition has a technical drawback because the data are not compatible: the
quantum group action on H behaves badly with respect to the algebra A. Indeed, the induced action
of the CQG on A is not a CQG-action on the C∗-closure of A. Therefore, driven by comments of
Goswami himself, we note the following proposition, found in [13].

Proposition 1.20. Let (A,H, D) and (C(G), ∆, U) be as above. Then there exists an algebra A1
such that

1. A1 is SOT-dense in the von Neumann Algebra M = A′′,
2. αU is algebraic on A1, i.e. (αU )|A1
: A1 → A1 ⊙ C(G),
3. [D, a] is bounded for every a ∈ A1,
4. (A1,H, D) is again a spectral triple.

Proof. This follows from sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 and theorem 4.10 in [13]

QED

Therefore we will use the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1.21. Let (A,H, D) be a compact spectral triple, G = (C(G), ∆) a compact quantum
group and U a unitary representation of G on H. Then G is said to act algebraically and by
orientation-preserving isometries on (A,H, D) with U if

• for every state φ on M, we have UφD = DUφ where Uφ := (id⊗φ)(U),
• αU is algebraic on A, i.e. (αU )|A : A → A ⊙ C(G) where αU (T ) := U(T ⊗ 1)U ∗ for T ∈ B(H).
In what follows, we will always work with compact quantum groups acting algebraically on the

algebra A.

7

2 Deformation procedure for spectral triples

In this section we will describe the actual deformation procedure for spectral triples. The deformation
data to start with are:

• a sprectral triple (A,H, D) of compact type,
• a compact quantum group G1 = (C(G1), ∆1) acting algebraically and by orientation-preserving

isometries on (A,H, D) with a unitary representation U and

• a unitary ﬁber functor ψ on G1.
The unitary ﬁber functor will induce a new compact quantum group G2 and a ∗-algebra B with
left resp. right action of G1 resp. G2. Using this, one can deform the data one by one to obtain a
new, deformed, spectral triple on which G2 acts in an appropriate way.

To make all of this exact, consider the following:

1. As ψ is a unitary ﬁber functor on G1, following theorem 1.12 there exists a compact quantum
group G2 and a monoidal equivalence ϕ : G1 → G2. We will call G2 the deformed quantum
group.

2. Let (B, ω) be the ∗-algebra and faithful invariant state associated to ϕ with the action

and let C(G2) be the deformed quantum group with action:

β1 : B → C(G1) ⊙ B

β2 : B → B ⊗ C(G2).

3. Let X x ∈ B(Hϕ(x ),Hx ) ⊙ B be the unitaries such that

(id⊗β1)X x = U x

12X x
13

and

(id⊗β2)X x = X x

12U ϕ(x )

13

.

4. Let u : H → H ⊗ C(G1) : ξ 7→ U(ξ ⊗ 1) be the representation of G1 on H and denote by

α = adU : A → A ⊙ C(G1) : a → U(a ⊗ 1C(G1))U ∗ the algebraic action of G1 on A.
We start by introducing the deformed data and proving some basic facts about them.

Proposition 2.1. Deﬁning L2(B) to be the GNS representation of B with respect to ω and Λ : B →
L2(B) the GNS map, we have:

1. there exists a unitary representation β′

1 of C(G1) on L2(B) such that β′

1(Λ(b)) = (id⊗Λ)(β1(b)).

2. β′

1 is ergodic, i.e. if ξ ∈ L2(B) such that β′

1(ξ) = 1 ⊗ ξ, then ξ ∈ CΛ(1B).

3. The vector space H ⊠
which we denote by ˜H.

C(G1 )

L2(B) = {ξ ∈ H ⊗ L2(B)|U12ξ13 = (idH ⊗β′

Proof.

1. As ω is faithful on B, Λ is injective and hence β′

β1 is a well deﬁned CQG-action and that ω is β1-invariant, β′
representation on L2(B).

1 is well deﬁned on Λ(B). Using that
1 can be extended to a unitary

2. Let ξ be an element in L2(B) satisfying β′

1(ξ) = 1 ⊗ ξ. Take a sequence (bn)n in B with
Λ(bn) → ξ in L2-norm, then for P = (h ⊗ idL2(B))β′
1 we see that P (Λ(bn)) → P (ξ) = ξ since P
is a continuous operator on L2(B). Seeing that P (Λ(bn)) = ω(bn)Λ(1B) ∈ C1B concludes this
proof.

3. It follows directly that H ⊠

L2(B) is a vector subspace of the tensor product Hilbert space
H ⊗ L2(B). As the representations u and β of C(G1) on H resp. L2(B) are continuous and
H ⊠

L2(B) is the kernel of u ⊗ idL2(B) − idH ⊗β′

L2(B) is complete.

Using that β′
ensures that fx and gx are inverse to each other. Finally, using that X x is unitary, it is easy to
see that fx and gx are also unitary.

2. Note ﬁrst that as D has compact resolvent, there exist a real sequence of eigenvalues (λn)n with

ﬁnite dimensional eigenspaces and such that limn→∞ λn = ∞. Hence we have H =Lλ∈σ(D) Vλ

Theorem 2.5. ( ˜A, ˜H, ˜D) constitues a spectral triple.
Proof. Combining all the previous propositions, it suﬃces to prove that the commutator of ˜D with
an element a ∈ ˜A is bounded. For that, we will ﬁrst prove that ˜A leaves the domain of ˜D invariant
and secondly we will proof that the commutator of ˜D and an arbitrary a ∈ ˜A is bounded. Let z
be an arbitrary element in A ⊙ B and let ξ be an arbitrary vector in dom(D ⊗ id). We will prove
zξ ∈ dom(D ⊗ id). As ξ ∈ dom(D ⊗ id), there exists a sequence ξn in dom(D) ⊙ L2(B) such that
simultaneously ξn → ξ and (D⊗id)ξn → (D⊗id)ξ for n → ∞. Note that as A leaves the domain of D
invariant, A⊙B leaves the core dom(D)⊙ L2(B) of D⊗ id invariant and hence zξn ∈ dom(D)⊙ L2(B)
for all n. Moreover, as A has bounded commutator with D, one can prove that [D ⊗ id, z] is bounded

10

on dom(D) ⊙ L2(B) and (D ⊗ id)z(ξn)n is a Cauchy sequence and thus converging. As zξn is an
element of the core converging to zξ and ((D⊗id)z(ξn))n converges, we know that zξ ∈ dom(D⊗id)
and (D ⊗ id)zξn → (D ⊗ id)zξ. We can conclude that (A ⊙ B)(dom(D ⊗ id)) ⊂ dom(D ⊗ id) and it
follows directly that ˜A(dom( ˜D)) ⊂ dom( ˜D).

Finally, we prove that ˜Dz − z ˜D is indeed bounded on the domain of ˜D. Let ξ ∈ dom( ˜D) arbitrary

and take a sequence ξn → ξ in dom(D) ⊙ L2(B). Then we know from above, that simultaneously

(D ⊗ id)zξn → (D ⊗ id)zξ,
z(D ⊗ id)ξn → z(D ⊗ id)ξ

and that [D ⊗ id, z] is bounded on dom(D) ⊙ L2(B). Combining that, one can prove that indeed
˜Dz − z ˜D is bounded on the domain.

L2(B) such that G2 acts

Theorem 2.6. There exists a unitary representation ˜U of C(G2) on H ⊠
algebraically and by orientation-preserving isometries on ( ˜A, ˜H, ˜D) with ˜U.
Proof. Using the CQG action β2 : B → B ⊙ C(G2), one can make, along the line of Lemma 5 in [7]
and the discussion above it, a representation ˜U0 ∈ M(K(L2(B)) ⊗ C(G2)) such that

C(G1 )

Moreover, we know this is a unitary representation and furthermore,

˜U0(Λ(b) ⊗ a) = (Λ ⊗ idC(G2))(cid:0)β2(b)(1B ⊗ a)(cid:1).

β2(b) = ˜U0(b ⊗ id) ˜U0.

(2.2)

Now one can prove that idH ⊗ ˜U0 ∈ M(K(H ⊗ L2(B)) ⊗ C(G2)) restricts to a representation ˜U ∈
1 ⊗ idC(G2)) ˜U0 =
M(K(H ⊠
(idC(G1) ⊗ ˜U0)(β′

Indeed, as β1 and β2 commute, one has (β′

= (U ⊗ idL2(B) ⊗ idC(G2 ))(cid:0)(idH ⊗ ˜U0)(ξ ⊗ a)(cid:1)134

Then it suﬃces to prove that ˜U commutes with the Dirac operator of the deformed spectral triple
and that there is an algebraic action of G2 on ˜A. As ˜D is the restriction of D ⊗ idL2(B) and ˜U is
the restriction of idH ⊗ ˜U0, it follows directly that they commute. Using theorem 1.16, we know that,
given the action

α1 = adU : A → A ⊙ C(G1) : a → U(a ⊗ idA)U ∗,

there is an action α2 : ˜A → ˜A ⊙ C(G2) : z → (idA ⊗β2)(z). Using (2.2), α2 = idA ⊗ ad ˜U0
and
regarding elements of A as operators on H, we have α2 = ad ˜U .

To end this section, we will show that via the inverse monoidal equivalence on the deformed quan-
tum group and spectral triple, one can obtain the original data again. Let us ﬁrst ﬁx some notation.
Let (A,H, D) be a spectral triple, G1 a compact quantum group acting algebraically and by orientation-
preserving isometries on (A,H, D). Let ψ be a unitary ﬁber functor, inducing a monoidal equivalence
ϕ : G1 → G2 with bi-Galois object B. Denote by ϕ−1 : G2 → G1 the inverse monoidal equivalence
with bi-Galois object ˜B generated by the matrix coeﬃcients of unitaries Zy ∈ B(Hϕ−1(y ),Hy ) ⊙ ˜B,
y ∈ Irred(G2) and actions δ1 : ˜B → ˜B ⊙ C(G1) and δ2 : ˜B → C(G2) ⊙ ˜B such that

3 Cocycle deformation of spectral triples

In this chapter we will ﬁx a spectral triple (A,H, D), a quantum group G acting algebraically on it
by orientation-preserving isometries and a unitary ﬁber functor ψ on G which satisﬁes dim(Hx ) =
dim(Hψ(x )) for every x ∈ Irred(G). Unitary ﬁber functors which satisfy this condition will be called to
be dimension-preserving and monoidal deformation via a dimension-preserving unitary ﬁber functor, a
dimension-preserving monoidal deformation. De Rijdt et al. proved in [6] that dimension-preserving
unitary ﬁber functors are in one-to-one correspondence with 2-cocycles on the dual quantum group.
Using this, we will prove that dimension-preserving monoidal deformation is equivalent to the cocycle
deformation introduced in [13]. In this chapter we will frequently use slight adaptations of the work
of De Rijdt [6].

3.1 Cocycles on the dual of a compact quantum group

Let G be a compact quantum group.

Deﬁnition 3.1. 2 Let G be a compact quantum group and (c0( ˆG), ˆ∆) its dual. We say a unitary
element Ω ∈ M(c0( ˆG) ⊗ c0( ˆG)) is a 2-cocycle on ˆG if it satisﬁes

(Ω ⊗ 1)(ˆ∆ ⊗ id)(Ω) = (1 ⊗ Ω)(id⊗ˆ∆)(Ω).

(3.1)

Denoting for x ∈ Irred(G), px to be the projection c0( ˆG) → B(Hx ), we will say a cocycle is
normalized if (pε ⊗ id)Ω = pε ⊗ id and (id⊗pε)Ω = id⊗pε. From now on we will always assume
2-cocycles to be normalized.

Proposition 3.2 ([6]). Let Ω be a normalized unitary 2-cocycle on ˆG and denote

Ω(2) = (Ω ⊗ 1)(ˆ∆ ⊗ id)(Ω) = (1 ⊗ Ω)(id⊗ˆ∆)(Ω).

2In [6], the authors use another convention for cocycle. In fact, if Ω is a cocycle in our sense, Ω∗ is one in the sense

of Ann De Rijdt and coauthors.

13

Then there exists a unique unitary ﬁber functor ψΩ on G such that

HψΩ(x ) = Hx ,

ψΩ(S) = ΩS,

ψΩ(T ) = Ω(2)T

for all S ∈ Mor(y ⊗ z, x) and T ∈ Mor(x ⊗ y ⊗ z, a) and x, y , z ∈ Irred(G). Moreover it is dimension-
preserving.

Proof. The proof follows directly as our ψ satisﬁes the conditions of remark 1.10. That it is dimension-
QED
preserving, follows directly by construction.
Using this unitary ﬁber functor, one can make a new compact quantum group GΩ = (C(GΩ), ∆Ω)
[6] and a monoidal equivalence ϕ : G → GΩ along the lines of proposition 1.11. Note that the dual
quantum group will be (c0( ˆGΩ), ˆ∆Ω) where

c0( ˆGΩ) = Mx ∈Irred(G)

B(Hx ) = c0( ˆG)

ˆ∆Ω(a)ψΩ(S) = ψΩ(S)a

and

where ˆ∆Ω(a) = Ω∆(a)Ω∗.

Proposition 3.3 ([6]). For every dimension-preserving unitary ﬁber functor ψ on a quantum group
G, there exists a normalized unitary 2-cocycle Ω on ˆG such that ψ ∼= ψΩ.
Proof. The proof is a slightly adapted version of the proof of proposition 4.5 in [6].

QED
This theorems tells us that every dimension-preserving monoidal equivalence comes from a cocycle.
The next step to prove that a dimension-preserving monoidal deformation of a spectral triple is a
cocycle deformation is to introduce the algebraic notion of a 2-cocycle. We will proof that every
2-cocycle on the dual of a compact quantum group induces an algebraic 2-cocycle on the compact
quantum group and that the monoidal deformation is equivalent to a cocycle deformation of the
spectral triple as was introduced by Goswami in [13].

3.2 Algebraic 2-cocycle deformation of a spectral triple

We will start with deﬁning the algebraic counterpart of a 2-cocycle on the dual of a compact quantum
group. In algebraic literature (for example Schauenburg [18]), the deﬁnition and theorems are stated
for Hopf algebras. We make slight adaptations to Hopf-∗-algebras.

Deﬁnition 3.4. Let H be a Hopf-algebra.

1. An (algebraic) dual 2-cocycle on H is a linear map σ : H ⊙ H → C such that

σ(a(1), b(1))σ(a(2)b(2), c) = σ(b(1), c(1))σ(a, b(2)c(2))

and σ(1, h) = σ(h, 1) = ε(h) for all a, b, c, h ∈ H.

2. A dual 2-cocycle is called invertible if there exists a linear map σ′ : H ⊙ H → C such that

σ(a(1), b(1))σ′(a(2), b(2)) = ε(a)ε(b) = σ′(a(1), b(1))σ(a(2), b(2)).

In this case, σ′ is called the inverse dual cocycle and written σ−1. Moreover σ−1 satisﬁes

σ−1(a(1)b(1), c)σ−1(a(2), b(2)) = σ−1(a, b(1)c(1))σ−1(b(2), c(2)).

14

3. If H is a Hopf-∗-algebra, a dual 2-cocycle σ is called unitary if it satisﬁes

In that case, we also have

σ(a, b) = σ−1(S(a)∗, S(b)∗).

σ−1(a, b) = σ(S(a)∗, S(b)∗).

In the rest of the chapter, when we use 2-cocycles on Hopf-∗-algebras, we will always assume

them to be unitary.

Using such a dual 2-cocycle, we can make a new ∗-algebra and several new H-comodule ∗-algebras.

We will use the following linear maps:

• U : H → C : h 7→ σ(h(1), S(h(2))),
• V : H → C : h 7→ U(S−1(h)).

One can prove that for U −1(h) = σ−1(S(h(1)), h(2)) and V −1(h) = U −1(S−1(h)) one has U(h(1))U −1(h(2)) =
ε(h) = U −1(h(1))U(h(2)) and V (h(1))V −1(h(2)) = ε(h) = V −1(h(1))V (h(2)).

Deﬁnition 3.5. Given an invertible dual 2-cocycle σ on a Hopf ∗-algebra (H, ∆, ε, S,∗ ), we deﬁne
(Hσ, ∆σ, εσ, Sσ,∗σ ) to be the twisted Hopf ∗-algebra which

• is isomorphic to H as a co-algebra,
• has multiplication deﬁned by g ·σ h = σ(g(1), h(1))g(2)h(2)σ−1(g(3), h(3)),

• has twisted multiplication (1#g)(1#h) = σ(g(1), h(1))#g(2)h(2),

Theorem 3.9 ([13]3). Let (A,H, D) be a spectral triple and G a compact quantum group acting
on it algebraically and by orientation-preserving isometries with the representation U. Let σ be an
(algebraic) unitary dual 2-cocycle on C(G). Then
(a) there exists a representation πσ : A #σ−1 C → B(H)
(b) (A #σ−1 C,H, D) is a spectral triple.
Proof. (a) Denote the the coaction α = adU of C(G) on A #σ−1 C by α(a) = a(0) ⊗ a(1). Let N be a
dense subspace of H such that U(N ) ⊂ N ⊙ C(G) and on that subspace, let U(ξ) = ξ(0) ⊗ ξ(1).
Then we can deﬁne, for a ∈ A #σ−1 C:

πσ(a) : H → H : ξ 7→ a(0)ξ(0)σ−1(a(1), ξ(1)).

In section 4.3 of [13] in it is proved that πσ(a) is bounded for all a ∈ A #σ−1 C and that πσ is a
well deﬁned ∗-morphism.

(b) This is theorem 4.10(4) in [13].

3.3 Linking dimension-preserving monoidal equivalences with algebraic cocy-

cles

In proposition 3.3, we proved that there is an equivalence between dimension-preserving unitary ﬁber
functors on a compact quantum group G and cocycles on the dual ˆG. In the following theorem 3.10,
we will prove that there is also an equivalence between cocycles on ˆG and (algebraic) dual cocycles

3We want to note that Goswami erroneously referred to [15] to explain the deformation of the Hopf-∗-algebra.
Indeed, Majid uses a reality condition and Goswami a unitarity condition, which makes the theory of Majid not applicable
here. We developed a new deformation of the star structure using a unitary cocycle which results in deﬁnitions 3.5 and
3.6.

on C(G). Moreover, we will show in theorem 3.11 that the bi-Galois object B associated with the
monoidal equivalence induced by the ﬁber functor, will be of the form B = C(G) σ−1 #C.
Theorem 3.10. Let G be a compact quantum group. If Ω is a unitary 2-cocycle on the dual ˆG, the
formula

σ(ux

i j ⊗ uy

kl ) = hξx

i ⊗ ξy

k , Ω(ξx

j ⊗ ξy

l )i, x, y ∈ Irred(G)

(3.2)

deﬁnes a unique (algebraic) unitary dual 2-cocycle σ on C(G). On the other hand, if σ is an (algebraic)
unitary dual 2-cocycle on C(G), formula 3.2 uniquely deﬁnes a unitary 2-cocycle Ω on ˆG.
Proof. Under the ﬁrst assumption, as the ux
i j constitute a basis of C(G), the linear map σ is well
deﬁned. Using the cocycle property (3.1) of Ω, one can check that σ satisﬁes the dual cocycle
condition in deﬁnition 3.4(1). It is normalized and unitary as Ω is normalized and unitary. Under the
second assumption, Ω is uniquely and well deﬁned as element of M(c0( ˆG)⊗c0( ˆG)). The dual cocycle
condition in deﬁnition 3.4(1) will imply the cocycle condition (3.1) of Ω. Again, Ω is normalized and
QED
unitary as σ is.
Remark that, as Ω∗ is the inverse of Ω, we see that σ′ associated with Ω∗ is the convolution

inverse of σ. We will denote it with σ−1 and we have

σ−1(ux

i j ⊗ uy

kl ) = hξx

i ⊗ ξy

k , Ω∗(ξx

j ⊗ ξy

l )i.

Theorem 3.11. Let G be a compact quantum group with a dimension-preserving unitary ﬁber functor
ψ. Let B be the bi-Galois object associated to ψ with action β1 : B → C(G1) ⊙ B, let Ω be the
unitary 2-cocycle on the dual ˆG associated to ψ ∼= ψΩ and σ the algebraic dual 2-cocycle equivalent
with Ω (proposition 3.10). Then there exists a ∗-algebra isomorphism

χ : B → C(G) σ−1#C

such that (id⊗χ)β1 = ∆ ◦ χ.
Proof. Denoting ϕ : G → GΩ to be the monoidal equivalence associated to ψ, we can ﬁnd unitaries
ux = Hx → Hϕ(x ), as dim(ϕ(x)) = dim(x) for all x ∈ Irred(G). Fixing a x ∈ Irred(G), we can deﬁne
Y x = X x (ux ⊗ 1) ∈ B(Hx ) ⊗ B and

Y ′ = ⊕x ∈Irred(G)Y x ∈ M(c0( ˆG) ⊗ B)

(where we take the direct sum over all classes, all of them with multiplicity one). Note that the
matrix coeﬃcients of the X x constitute a basis of B by theorem 1.12. As the ux are unitaries, also
the matrix coeﬃcients of the Y x (let’s call them bx
i j ) and hence of Y ′ form a basis of B. As both the
(ux

i j )i j,x are bases of C(G) resp. B, we have a vector space isomorphism

i j )i j,x and (bx

χ : C(G) → B : ux

i j → bx

which is compatible with the actions (i.e.
analogously as in the proof proposition 4.5 of [6], Y ′ satisﬁes the equation

(id⊗χ)β1 = ∆ ◦ χ). Moreover, one can prove that,

(ˆ∆ ⊗ id)(Y ′) = Y ′

23(Ω ⊗ 1B).

Finally, to check that χ is a ∗-algebra isomorphism, note that by the previous equation, we also have

χ(ab∗) = χ(a(0))χ(b∗

3.4 Dimension-preserving monoidal deformation is isomorphic to algebraic 2-

cocycle deformation

In this last paragraph of section 3, we state and prove the main result of this section: the Goswami-
Joardar cocycle deformation amounts to our deformation with a dimension-preserving monoidal equiv-
alence.

Theorem 3.12. Let (A,H, D) be a spectral triple, G a compact quantum group acting on it al-
gebraically and by orientation-preserving isometries via a unitary representation U and let ψ be a
dimension-preserving unitary ﬁber functor on G. Denoting by B the corresponding bi-Galois object,
L2(B), ˜D) deﬁned in
there exists an (algebraic) unitary dual 2-cocycle σ such that (A ⊡
section 2 and (A #σ−1 C,H, D) are isomorphic as spectral triples.

C(G) B,H ⊠

C(G)

Remember that B is the bi-Galois object associated to the ﬁber functor ψ, L2(B) the GNS-space
with respect tot the invariant state ω = (h ⊗ id)β1 and the deformed Dirac operator ˜D from section
2. We give the proof via some propositions.

Proposition 3.13.

1. There exists a unitary Y ∈ B(H) ⊙ B such that φ : H → H ⊠

C(G)

L2(B) :

ξ → Y (ξ ⊗ 1) is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces.

2. Under this isomorphism, φD = ˜Dφ.

3. A ⊡

C(G) B ∼= A σ−1#C with σ the algebraic dual 2-cocycle associated to the dimension-preserving

unitary ﬁber functor ψ.

18

Proof.

1. Recall the unitaries ux : Hx → Hϕ(x ) from the proof of theorem 3.11 and the mutually

inverse unitaries

and

fx : Hϕ(x ) → Hx ⊠

C(G)

L2(B) : ξ 7→ X x (ξ ⊗ Λ(1B))

from the proof Theorem 2.2 point 1. Therefore, deﬁning φx = fx ◦ ux =: Hx → Hx ⊠
L2(B) → Hx and Y = ⊕x ∈Irred(G)Y x we can make φ = Px ∈Irred(G) φx
φ′
x = u∗
(where in both cases we take the sum over the irreducible representations appearing in the
decomposition of U) such that φ(ξ) = Y (ξ ⊗ 1) for ξ ∈ H. Y is unitary and hence φ is the
desired isomorphism of Hilbert spaces.

C(G)

C(G)

2. We have to prove that φ(Dξ) = ˜D(φ(ξ)) for ξ ∈ dom(D). Denoting Pλn resp. ˜Pλn to be the
L2(B), note that, as Y = (id⊗χ)(U) and U commutes with

C(G)

⊠

projection onto Vλn resp. Vλn
D, φ(Pλn ξ) = ˜Pλn (φ(ξ)). Then

Xn

|λn|2k ˜Pλn (φ(ξ))k2 =Xn

|λn|2kφ(Pλn (ξ))k2 =Xn

|λn|2kPλn (ξ)k2 < ∞

as ξ ∈ dom(D) and hence φ maps the domain of D into the domain of ˜D. Also, by the previous
remark, trivially, ˜Dn = ˜D|Vλn
commutes with φ for all n. Taking the direct sum, we can
conclude that also ˜D commutes with φ.

L2(B)

3. The proof follows from theorem 3.8 and theorem 3.11.

QED
Finally, it suﬃces to prove that the actions of the algebras on the Hilbert spaces are isomorphic.

Proposition 3.14. The action of A σ−1 #C on H is isomorphic to the action of A ⊡
L2(B) i.e. if φ : H → H ⊠
the previous proposition, we have:

L2(B) and (id⊗χ)α : A σ−1 #C → A ⊡

for the deformed action of a#1 ∈ A σ−1 #C on ξ, we will prove that

4 Constructing a non-dimension-preserving example

In this section, we will construct an example of a monoidal deformation coming from a non-dimension-
preserving monoidal equivalence. We will use the spectral triple on the Podle´s spheres ([16]) deﬁned in
[10] and SOq(3), which acts on it in the appropriate way. To have monoidal equivalences on SOq(3),
we will use that C(SOq(3)) is a Woronowicz C∗-subalgebra of SUq(2): we ﬁrst describe a method to
induce a monoidal equivalence between two Woronowicz C∗-subalgebras of two monoidal equivalent
compact quantum groups and after that, we investigate monoidal equivalences on SUq(2).

4.1

Inducing monoidal equivalences on Woronowicz-C∗-subalgebras

Let G = (C(G), ∆) be a compact quantum group. Then we have the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 4.1 ([1]). Let G = (C(G), ∆) be a compact quantum group and A a C∗-subalgebra of
C(G) such that ∆(A) ⊂ A ⊗ A and [∆|A (A)(A ⊗ 1)] = A ⊗ A = [∆|A (A)(1 ⊗ A)]. Then A is called a
Woronowicz C∗-subalgebra. We will write A = (A, ∆|A ) for the quantum group.

It is good to remark that the notion of compact quantum quotient group introduced in [21] is
a special case of a Woronowicz C∗-subalgebra. However it is still unknown whether all Woronowicz

20

C∗-subalgebras are compact quantum quotient groups.

In this section let G = (C(G), ∆) be a CQG and A a Woronowicz C∗-subalgebra of G. In order to
deﬁne a unitary ﬁber functor on A, it is good to examine its representations. It is easy to see that every
representation U of A on a Hilbert space H is a representation of G and that every representation V
of G is a representation of A if and only if V ∈ M(K(H) ⊗ A). To distinguish, we will write UG for a
representation U of A seen as representation of G. Moreover, we have the following proposition

Proposition 4.2. Let U be a unitary representation of A. Then U is irreducible if and only if UG is
irreducible.

Proof. We know that U resp. UG is irreducible if and only if Mor(U, U) = {T ∈ B(H)|(T ⊗ id)U =
U(T ⊗ id)} resp. Mor(UG, UG) equals C1B(H). As it is directly clear that Mor(U, U) = Mor(UG, UG),
QED
the proposition is proved.
Analogously as before, we will write xG if we look at the equivalence class x ∈ Irred(A) seen as
equivalence class in Irred(G). Using this proposition, the unitary ﬁber functor is easily made: let G1
be a compact quantum group and ϕ : G1 → G2 a monoidal equivalence between them. Suppose
moreover that A1 is a Woronowicz subalgebra of G1. Then we can construct a unitary ﬁber functor
on A1 = (A1, ∆|A1
) by restricting ϕ to the representations of A and proof it is a monoidal equivalence
between A1 and a compact quantum group A2 such that C(A2) is a Woronowciz C∗-algebra of G2.

Proposition 4.3. Let G1 be a compact quantum group, A1 a Woronowicz C∗-subalgebra of G1 and
ψ a unitary ﬁber functor on G1. Then there exists a unitary ﬁber functor ψ′ on A1 = (A1, ∆1|A1
) such
that ψ′(x) = ψ(xG1 ) for all x ∈ Irred(A1).
Proof. Let x ∈ Irred(A1). Deﬁne Hψ′(x ) to be Hψ(xG) and ψ′(S) = ψ(S) for every S ∈ Mor(y1 ⊗
. . .⊗ yk , x1 ⊗ . . .⊗ xr ), y1, . . . , yk , x1, . . . , xr ∈ Irred(A1). As ψ is a unitary ﬁber functor, ψ′ will satisfy
QED
all the necessary conditions to be a unitary ﬁber functor as well.
Denoting by ϕ : G1 → G2 the monoidal equivalence associated to ψ, we can see C(G2) as the C∗-
algebra generated (as vector space) by the coeﬃcients of the U ϕ(x ), x ∈ Irred(G1). Now we can deﬁne
A2 as the C∗-algebra generated (as vector space) by the coeﬃcients of the U ϕ(xG1 ), x ∈ Irred(A1).
Equivalently,

and we also write

A2 = [(ω ⊗ id)U ϕ(xG1 )|x ∈ Irred(A1)]

A2 = h(ω ⊗ id)U ϕ(xG1 )|x ∈ Irred(A1)i

Now it is clear that ψ′ induces a monoidal equivalence ϕ′ between A1 and a compact quantum

group with algebra A2.

Theorem 4.4. With the map ∆′
monoidal equivalence ϕ′, induced by ψ is an equivalence between A1 and A2.

, A2 = (A2, ∆′

2 = ∆2|A2

2) is a compact quantum group. Moreover the

Proof. Written diﬀerently, A2 is the closed linear span of the elements u
deﬁned as above, we get:

and as x ∈ Irred(A1), we see that ∆′
2(A2) ⊂ A2 ⊗ A2. Now denote by ε′ and S′ the restrictions of the
counit ε and antipode S of G2 deﬁned on C(G2) to A2. Then A2 = h(ω⊗ id)U ϕ(xG1 )|x ∈ Irred(A1)i =
C(A2) is a Hopf-∗-algebra which is dense in A2. This proves that A2 = (A2, ∆′
2) is indeed a compact
quantum group. By construction of ϕ′, it is evident that it is a monoidal equivalence between A1 and
QED
A2.

21

Before we go the next paragraph, we want to explore how the G1 − G2-bi-Galois object behaves

with respect to the A1 − A2-bi-Galois object .
Theorem 4.5. Let G1, G2, A be compact quantum groups such that C(A) is a Woronowicz C∗-
subalgebra of C(G1) and such that ϕ : G1 → G2 is a monoidal equivalence. Let B be the G1 − G2-
Galois object with β1 : B → C(G1) ⊙ B. Let ϕ′ be the monoidal equivalence between A1 and A2 as
deﬁned above and deﬁne B′ to be the A1 − A2-Galois object with γ1 : B′ → C(A1) ⊙ B′. Then we
have

B′ = {b ∈ B|β1(b) ∈ C(A1) ⊙ B}

and γ1 = β1|B′ .
Proof. From the original proof of theorem 1.12 (which is theorem 3.9 in [6]), we know that B′ =
⊕x ∈Irred(A1)B(Hϕ(x ),Hx )∗ and B = ⊕x ∈Irred(G1)B(Hϕ(x ),Hx )∗. Hence B′ ⊂ B. Also, X x ∈ B(Hϕ(x ),Hx )⊙
B is deﬁned such that (ωx ⊗ id)(X x ) = (δx ,y ωx )y ∈Irred(G1) for all ωx ∈ B(Hϕ(x ),Hx )∗. By deﬁnition,
we see that for x ∈ Irred(A1), X x = X xG1 . As β1 resp. γ1 are deﬁned by (id⊗β1)(X x ) = U x
12X x
13
(x ∈ Irred(G1)) resp. (id⊗γ1)(X x ) = U x
13 (x ∈ Irred(A1)), it follows directly that γ1 = (β1)|B′ .
13 ∈ B(Hϕ(x ),Hx ) ⊙ C(A1) ⊙ B and hence for b ∈ B′, β1(b) ∈
Moreover, if x ∈ Irred(A1), U x
C(A1) ⊙ B. If x ∈ Irred(G1) but x /∈ Irred(A1), U x
13 /∈ B(Hϕ(x ),Hx ) ⊙ C(A1) ⊙ B and hence for
b ∈ B but b /∈ B′, β1(b) /∈ C(A1) ⊙ B. This concludes the proof.
QED
Remark 4.6. In the special case of compact quantum quotient groups, a compact quantum quotient
group of G1 will be monoidally equivalent with a compact quantum group which has as algebra a
Woronowicz C∗-subalgebra of G2. Whether that compact quantum group is a compact quantum
quotient group as well is still unknown [21].

4.2 Monoidal equivalences on SUq(2)

We look at orthogonal quantum groups and SUq(2) in particular.

Deﬁnition 4.7 (Van Daele -Wang, [20]). Let n ∈ N and F ∈ GL(n, C) with F F = cIn ∈ RIn.
Then Ao (F ) is deﬁned as the universal quantum group generated by the coeﬃcients of the matrix
U ∈ Mn(Ao (F )) with relations

• U is a unitary and
• U = F UF −1.

Moreover, (Ao(F ), U) is a compact matrix quantum group. They are called universal orthogonal
quantum groups.

As the matrices F are not in one to one correspondence with the universal quantum groups (i.e.
diﬀerent F ’s can deﬁne the same universal quantum groups), it is necessary (but not so hard) to
classify the quantum groups Ao (F ). This has been done in [6].

Proposition 4.8. For F1, F2 matrices in GL(n, C) with Fi F i = ±1, we say

F1 ∼ F2 if there exists a unitary v ∈ U(n) such that F1 = v F2v T .

Then

Ao(F1) ∼= Ao(F2) if and only if F1 ∼ F2.

Therefore, we will describe a fundamental domain for ∼ as is done in [6].

22

D(λ1, . . . , λk )−1

Proposition 4.9. A fundamental domain of ∼ is given by the following classes of matrices:

by two elements α, γ satisfying relations such that U =  α −qγ∗
α∗ ! ∈ M2(A) is a unitary matrix.
With coproduct ∆(Ui j ) =Pk Ui k ⊗ Ukj , SUq(2) = (A, ∆) is a compact quantum group.
Proposition 4.12. With Fq deﬁned in remark 4.10, we have Ao(Fq) ∼= SUq(2).

γ

Note that this last statement indeed implies that the only orthogonal quantum groups coming

from matrices of dimension 2, are the quantized versions of SU(2).

We state some results obtained by de Rijdt et al. in [6] (Corollary 5.4 and Theorem 5.5).

Theorem 4.13. Let F1 ∈ GL(n1, C) with F1F 1 = c11, c1 ∈ R. Then

then Cu(Ao(F1, F2)) 6= 0 is the Ao(F1)− Ao(F2)-bi-Galois object with actions β1 of Ao(F1) and
β2 of Ao(F2) such that

(id⊗β1)(Y ) = Y12(U1)13

and

(id⊗β2)(Y ) = (U2)12Y13

where the Ui are the unitary representations of Ao (Fi ), which matrix coeﬃcients generate the
quantum groups.

• the monoidal equivalence preserves the dimensions if and only if n2 = n1. In this case, we denote
the unitary 2-cocycle by Ω(F2). The Ω(F2) describe up to equivalence all unitary 2-cocycles on
the dual of Ao (F1).

Remark 4.14. In [2] Banica shows that the irreducible representations of Ao (F ) can be labeled by N
(say rk , k ∈ N). Moreover, for dim(F ) = n, he states that dim(rk ) = (x k+1 − y k+1)/(x − y ) where x
and y are solutions of X 2 − nX + 1 = 0 for n ≥ 3 and dim(rk ) = k + 1 for n = 2. Hence, it is easy to
show by induction that if ϕ is a monoidal equivalence between SUq(2) and Ao (F ) with dim(F ) ≥ 4,
then dim(ϕ(rk )) > dim(rk ) = k + 1 for every irreducible representation rk with k ≥ 1.

Moreover, looking at the concrete orthogonal quantum group SUq(2), it is possible to classify all
compact quantum groups which are monoidally equivalent with SUq(2): indeed applying the result of
the last paragraph to the speciﬁc situation of F = Fq, we know exactly what the quantum groups are
which are monoidal equivalent with SUq(2).

Proposition 4.15 ([6]). Let 0 < q ≤ 1. For every even natural number n with 2 ≤ n ≤ q + 1/q, there
exists a monoidal equivalence on SUq(2) such that the multiplicity of the fundamental representation
! where
is n. Concretely, SUq(2) ∼mon Ao (F ) with F =

4.3 Monoidal equivalences on SOq(3)

In this paragraph, we deﬁne SOq(3) as coming from a Woronowicz-C∗-subalgebra of SUq(2). Using
the theorems, we will use the induction method to construct monoidal equivalences on SOq(3).

Deﬁnition 4.16 ([16]). Deﬁne B to be the unital ∗-subalgebra of C(SUq(2)) generated (as ∗-algebra)
by the elements α2, γ∗γ, γ2, αγ and γ∗α. The closure of B is a Woronowicz C∗-algebra of SUq(2)
and the associated compact quantum group is called SOq(3).

In the classical situation, we know that SO(3) is a quotient group of SU(2), indeed SO(3) =
SU(2)/{−1, 1}. In the quantum versions this is also true: we can prove that Z2 is a normal quantum
subgroup of SUq(2) and SUq(2)/Z2 equals SOq(3).

Now we have prepared all ingredients to apply the construction of paragraph 4.1 to our concrete
example. Therefore ﬁx a monoidal equivalence between SUq(2) and a suitable Ao(F ′) with dim(F ′) ≥
4, then from proposition 4.15, we see that q ≤ 2 − √3. As SOq(3) = SUq(2)/Z2, we ﬁnd a

Woronowicz subalgebra R(F ′) of Ao(F ′) such that SOq(3) is monoidally equivalent with R(F ′). Now
Theorem 4.1 in [22], gives us a concrete description of R(F ′).

Theorem 4.17 (Theorem 4.1 in [22]). Let F ∈ GL(n, C) be such that F F = ±In. Then every
Woronowicz subalgebra of Ao(F ) is a quantum quotient group. Moreover it has only one normal
subgroup of order 2 with quantum quotient group C∗(r2m) (where r2m is the irreducible representation
of dimension 2m).

Applying this theorem to F = Fq , it aﬃrms that SOq(3) is the only compact quantum quotient
group of SUq(2). Applying it to F = F ′, we get a concrete description of R(F ′). By remark 4.14,
it can be seen that the induced monoidal equivalence is not dimension-preserving and hence not a
2-cocycle deformation (by proposition 3.2).

Combining all of this, we get

Theorem 4.18. Let F ∈ GL(n, C) be such that F F = ±In and ϕ : SUq(2) → Ao (F ) a monoidal
equivalence with bi-Galois object B = Ao(Fq, F ). Deﬁne R(F ) to be the C∗-algebra generated by the
Ui j Ukl where U is the unitary in Mn(Ao (F )) satisfying the relation U = F UF −1 as in deﬁnition 4.7.
Deﬁne P (Fq, F ) to be the ∗-algebra generated by the Yi j Ykl where Y is the unitary in Mn2,n1(C) ⊗
Cu(Ao (F1, F2)) described in Theorem 4.13. Then there exists a monoidal equivalence ϕ′ : SOq(3) →
R(F ) with bi-Galois object B′ = P (Fq, F ) which is not dimension-preserving (by remark 4.14).

4.4 Monoidal deformation of the Podle´s sphere

In section 3, we proved that our monoidal deformation of spectral triples is a generalization of the
cocycle deformation, developed in [13].
In this last paragraph, we will give a concrete example to

24

prove that our construction is a genuine generalization: we will construct a monoidal deformation
of the Podles sphere (with spectral triple of Dabrowski, Landi, Wagner and D’Andrea [10]) which is
not a 2-cocycle deformation. First we recapitulate the deﬁnition of the Podles sphere S2
q,c and the
spectral triple on it. After that, we will recall the result in [5] that SOq(3) is the quantum isometry
group of S2
q,c and ﬁnally, we will use the unitary ﬁber functors on SOq(3) developed above to ﬁnd a
new spectral triple with a quantum group acting on it in an isometrical way.

4.4.1 The Podle´s sphere, its spectral triple and its quantum isometry group

The Podles sphere was initially constructed by Podle´s in [17] as follows. Let q ∈ (0, 1) and t ∈ (0, 1),
hence c = t−1 − t > 0. Then the Podles sphere S2
q,c is deﬁned as the universal unital C∗-algebra
generated by elements A, B which satisfy the relations

A∗ = A,
B∗B = A − A2 + c1,

AB = q−2BA,
BB∗ = q2A − q4A2 + c1.

You can see that for q = 1, we have A∗ = A, AB = BA, B∗B = BB∗ = A − A2 + c1 and this is the
classical sphere: putting A = z + 1/2, B = x + i y , r 2 = c + 1/4, we indeed have

x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = B∗B + A2 − A + 1/4 = c + 1/4 = r 2.

Note ﬁrst that for q ∈ (0, 1), setting

x0 = t(1 − (1 + q2)A), x−1 =

t(1 + q2)

q

B, x1 = −t(1 + q2)

we see that the deﬁnition in [10] with {x0, x−1, x1} is equivalent to the original deﬁnition of Podle´s
given above. Moreover, deﬁning

˜A =

1 + t−1qγ∗α − t−1ρ(1 − (1 + q2)γ∗γ) + t−1γα∗

˜B =

qα2 + ρ(1 + q2)αγ − q2γ2

(q2+1)2(1−t) , one can prove that the unital C∗-subalgebra of C(SUq(2)) generated by ˜A

where ρ2 =
and ˜B is isomorphic to S2
Doing as above, we have 3 equivalent descriptions of the Podles sphere.

q,c where c = t−1 − t, sending A to ˜A and B to ˜B.

The spectral triple on S2
q,c we will use, is the spectral triple developed by Dabrowski, D’Andrea,
Landi and Wagner in [10]. The spectral triple uses the representation theory of SUq(2) described
by Banica in [2]. To be compatible with [10], we use their notation. For each n in {0, 1/2, 1, . . .},
there exists a unique irreducible representation Dn (r2n in Banica’s notation) of dimension 2n + 1.
For example , we have

D1/2 =  α −qγ∗

Denoting d n

where c1, c2 ∈ R, c1 6= 0 are arbitrary constants. In [10] the authors prove that (S2
q,c ,H, D) consti-
tutes a well deﬁned spectral triple. Furthermore, in [5], Bhowmick and Goswami proved that SOq(3)
acts isometrically and by orientation-preserving isometries on (S2
q,c ,H, D). Indeed, from the descrip-
q,c with ˜A and ˜B as in the last section, one can prove that the coproduct of SUq(2) restricted
tion of S2
to the Podle´s sphere is indeed an action S2
q,c ⊗ C(SOq(3)). Even more, the action is algebraic
and SOq(3) is the quantum isometry group (deﬁned in [4]) of S2

q,c → S2

q,c .

4.4.2 Monoidal deformation of the Podle´s sphere

To conclude this section, we will use all the preparatory work above to construct the non-dimension-
preserving example. Now we know that there is a well deﬁned spectral triple (S2
q,c ,H, D) such that
SOq(3) acts algebraically and by orientation-preserving isometries on (S2
q,c ,H, D). Furthermore, we
know from proposition 4.15 what the monoidal equivalences of SUq(2) are and by Theorem 4.4, what
those are of SOq(3). Finally, we know that those monoidal equivalences are non-dimension-preserving.
Putting all this together, we can apply the construction described in section 2 to get the following
theorem.

Theorem 4.19. Let q ∈ (0, 1) and n an even natural number with 4 ≤ n ≤ q + 1/q. Let λ1, . . . , λn/2
strict positive real numbers not bigger than 1 and such that λ2
n/2 =
q + 1/q and deﬁne F to be the n by n matrix

n/2 + 1/λ2

F = 

0

D(λ1, . . . , λn/2)

−D(λ1, . . . , λn/2)−1

! .

Then there is a non-dimension-preserving monoidal equivalence ϕ from SOq(3) to R(F ) (introduced
in theorem 4.18). Denoting P (Fq, F ) the algebra constructed in 4.18, P (Fq, F ) is the associated

26

bi-Galois object and the following triplet is a spectral triple:

⊡

C(SOq (3))

P (Fq, F ), H ⊠

C(SOq (3))

L2(P (Fq, F )),

q

(cid:0)S 2

˜D(cid:1).

Moreover R(F ) acts algebraically and by orientation-preserving isometries on the new spectral triple.
As ϕ is non-dimension-preserving, it is not a 2-cocycle deformation `a la Goswami-Joardar [13].
