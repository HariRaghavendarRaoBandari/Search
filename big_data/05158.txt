We construct a phenomenological Landau-de Gennes theory for hard colloidal rods by performing
an order parameter expansion of the chemical-potential dependent grand potential. By ﬁtting the
coeﬃcients to known results of Onsager theory, we are not only able to describe the isotropic-
nematic phase transition as function of density, including the well-known density jump, but also the
isotropic-nematic planar interface. The resulting theory is applied in calculations of the isotropic
core size in a radial hedgehog defect, the density dependence of linear defects of hard rods in square
conﬁnement, and the formation of a nematic droplet in an isotropic background.

INTRODUCTION

Studying phase transitions involves a careful investiga-
tion of the free energy of the system, however, computing
it can be very hard, even for the simplest interactions [1].
In the case of symmetry-breaking transitions an order pa-
rameter can be deﬁned, which allows one to distinguish
a disordered state from an ordered one. From the micro-
scopic Hamiltonian close to a phase transition, a power
expansion in terms of this order parameter can often be
derived [2], the so-called Landau free energy [3], but it
can also be set up phenomenologically based on symme-
try grounds. The Landau free energy is usually stud-
ied on the level of a saddle-point approximation, such
that only polynomial Euler-Lagrange equations have to
be solved to understand the phase behaviour, and this
procedure has had many successes. Examples include
the spontaneous magnetization from a paramagnet to a
ferromagnet [4], the gas-liquid transition [5], and the for-
mation of a superconductor from an ordinary metal [6].
For nematic liquid crystals the order parameter is a
traceless and symmetric tensor Q [7] with components
Qαβ where α, β = 1, 2, 3 in three-dimensional systems.
This tensorial form is chosen because the ordered phase
breaks rotational (SO(3)-) symmetry, but there is a resid-
ual Z2, or up-down symmetry, which requires the theory
to be invariant under O(3), rather than SO(3). The bulk
Helmholtz (or Gibbs) free energy that describes the ﬁrst
order phase transition towards a nematic phase, can then
be expanded as

∗

∆F = A(T − T
where A, B and C are phenomenological coeﬀcients, T is
temperature and T ∗ is the temperature of the isotropic

spinodal. However, this so-called Landau-de Gennes ex-
pansion [7] is only suitable for thermotropics: materials
that become liquid crystalline as function of tempera-
ture.
It has been applied in many situations, ranging
from equilibrium [8] to non-equilibrium situations [9], in-
cluding colloidal particles immersed in a thermotropic
nematic [10, 11] and active nematics [12].

In contrast, lyotropic systems, which can consist of
hard rods or platelets [13–17], become ordered as a func-
tion of density [18], and are not described by the free
energy of Eq.
(1). A simple remedy for this problem
would be to replace T in Eq. (1) by the density ρ, but
this cannot capture the density jump that is found in the
isotropic-nematic (IN) phase transition, which can be as
large as 25% [19]. Most theories for lyotropics, such as
Onsager theory [20], do exhibit this density jump, but
are diﬃcult to handle numerically in more complex situ-
ations or geometries, because one has to solve a compli-
cated non-linear integral equation.

This motivates us to set up a Landau expansion for
lyotropics for which we will use the grand potential Ω
rather than the Helmholtz (or Gibbs) free energy F in
section II. By using Ω, the expansion parameters will
depend on the chemical potential µ [21], and the den-
sity jump will naturally be encoded through the relation
∂(Ω/V )/∂µ|V,T = −ρ, with V the volume of the system
and ρ the average density. We will explore the bulk prop-
erties of such a Landau expansion by ﬁtting and compar-
ing it with Onsager theory [20] in section III. Afterwards,
we ﬁt the square-gradient coeﬃcients by using the hard-
rod surface tension on parallel and perpendicular anchor-
ing for a planar IN interface in section IV. This approach
is similar to the one that is brieﬂy discussed by Wittmann
et al. in the context of fundamental measure theory [22]
. However, we will perform a more thorough analysis
of the quality of this theory compared to Onsager the-
ory. Finally, we show some applications: a study of the
isotropic core size in a hedgehog defect (section V), linear

defects and director textures for rods under conﬁnement
(section VI), and the shape and size of a nematic droplet
with a homogeneous director ﬁeld (section VII).

II. LANDAU-DE GENNES FREE ENERGY

Let us consider hard rods of length L and diameter
D at chemical potential µ in a macroscopic volume V
bounded by a surface ∂V . In the Landau grand potential,
we will consider terms that depend on Q and its spatial
gradient ∇Q,

∆Ω[Q] =

dr [∆ωb(Q(r)) + ωe(∇Q(r))] +

V

∂V

(cid:90)

dS ωs(Q(r)),

where ∆ωb is the bulk grand potential density with re-
spect to the isotropic state, ωe describes elastic deforma-
tions and surface tension eﬀects, and ωs is an anchoring
term that describes the interaction with external walls.
All the terms should be invariant under Q → UT QU,
with U ∈ O(3). We expand the bulk contribution with
respect to the isotropic state ∆ωb up until fourth order
in Q, which gives us

dimensionless. For simplicity we assume them to be in-
dependent of µ. Moreover, µ∗ will turn out to be the
chemical potential at the isotropic spinodal. When we
assume that the nematic phase is uniaxial, then Q can
be expressed in terms of the scalar order parameter S(r)
and the director ﬁeld n(r) for α, β = 1, 2, 3,

Qαβ(r) =

(4)

(cid:21)

Notice that the largest eigenvalue of Q is S, while the
corresponding (normalized) eigenvector is n. Using that
QαβQβα = (3/2)S2 and that QαβQβλQλα = (3/4)S3, we
can express Eq. (3) in terms of S as

∗
βB2∆ωb = aβ(µ

− µ)S2 − bS3 + dS4.

(5)

For the terms in gradients of Q we only retain terms

up until square gradients in Q which gives us [23]

βB2ωe(∇Q(r)) =

+ l2(∂αQαλ)(∂βQβλ) + l3(∂αQβλ)(∂λQβα)

(cid:105)

,

(6)

where the dimensionfull parameters l1, l2 and l3 are elas-
tic constants for Q. In general, they will depend on µ,
but for simplicity, we initially assume them to be con-
stant. Later, in section VII, we will investigate the eﬀect
when they are µ-dependent.

It is instructive to work out ωe for the uniaxial case of
Eq. (4). Since the norm of the director is a constant and
using the vector identities

[n × (∇ × n)]α = −nβ∂βnα,

(7)

where we will use the Einstein summation convention
throughout the paper. The second virial coeﬃcient in
the disordered isotropic phase is given by B2 = πL2D/4
in the limit L (cid:29) D, and is included in our deﬁnition to
render the Landau coeﬃcients a, b and d conveniently

(∂αnβ)(∂αnβ) = (∇ · n)2 + [n · (∇ × n)]2

(8)
+ |n × (∇ × n)|2 − ∇ · [n(∇ · n) + n × (∇ × n)],

we can recast ωe in the form

where we introduced ls = (l2 + l3)/2 and la = (l2 − l3)/2.
We see that ωe encodes for surface tension (ﬁrst line) and
elastic deformations (second line) [24]. Eq. (9) can be
compared with the Frank elastic free energy Fe [25, 26]
for a bulk nematic phase with a spatially constant bulk

K22 = K11/3 [27], which is not to be expected to hold in
the Landau expansion at this order. Finally, notice that
the last term of Eq. (10) is a surface contribution [28]
and that la will typically only contribute to the surface
free energy [7].

Finally, ωs in Eq. (2) is an anchoring contribution for
external walls, for which we assume the Rapini-Papoular
(like), or Nobili-Durand form [29, 30],

with w the dimensionless anchoring strength and Q0 the
preferred value of the tensor on the surface. Although
it is possible to minimize ∆Ω with respect to S, it is
more convenient and more general to directly minimize
Eq. (2) with respect to Q when the director ﬁeld varies
as function of position. However, one has to perform the
minimization under the constraint that Q is traceless and
symmetric, see for example Ref. [31].

III. BULK PROPERTIES

In bulk, we assume a fully uniaxial nematic phase
and hence it is suﬃcient to investigate Eq.
(5). The
(meta)stable and unstable points are found by the con-
dition ∂∆ωb/∂S = 0, resulting in the following solutions

solutely unstable. In grey we show data points obtained from
Onsager theory and we see that the LdG theory matches well
with it. With arrows we indicate the isotropic-nematic transi-
tion in both representations, exhibiting a density jump in the

The stability of these points can be investigated by an-
alyzing the sign of ∂2∆ωb/∂S2. The isotropic spin-
odal µ∗ is deﬁned by ∂2∆ωb/∂S2|S=SI = 0, while the
nematic spinodal βµ+ = βµ∗
− 9b2/(32ad) is the µ
for which ∂2∆ωb/∂S2|S=S+
= 0. Finally, the binodal
βµIN = βµ∗
− b2/(4ad) is determined from ∆ωB(SI ) =
∆ωB(S+
N ). A stability analysis shows that (i) for µ < µ+
the isotropic phase is the stable conﬁguration, (ii) for
−
µ+ < µ < µIN we have that S
N is absolutely unsta-
ble, while S+
N is metastable and the isotropic phase is
−
stable, and (iii) for µIN < µ < µ∗ we have that S
N is
absolutely unstable, while S+
N is stable and the isotropic
−
phase is metastable. (iv) For µ > µ∗ we have that S
N is
metastable, while S+
N is stable and the isotropic phase is
unstable. The resulting bifurcation diagram listing the
stability of all these branches is shown in the inset of
Fig. 1, where we indicate with arrows the IN transition
as function of µ. Below, we derive the values of the coef-
ﬁcients we used in Fig. 1 from ﬁts to Onsager theory.

When S is known for a given µ, one can convert µ to
the dimensionless density c = B2ρ. For this we introduce
the grand potential density of the isotropic state ωI and

where we have deﬁned cI (µ) = −∂(B2ωI )/∂µ. Within
Onsager theory, we calculate ωI by using an isotropic
distribution function, such that βµ(cI ) = log(cI /4π) +
2cI [32]. By inverting this relation, one obtains cI (µ).
Together with Eq. (14), and S one can determine c.

At isotropic-nematic coexistence, we have from Eq.

Within Onsager theory, it is known that [32] cI (µIN ) =
3.290, c(µIN ) = 4.191, βµ∗ = 6.855, βµIN = 5.241 and
SIN = 0.7922. Using these values, we ﬁnd a = 1.436,
b = 5.851 and d = 3.693. With this set of parameters, we
determine that βµ+ = 5.039 [33]. We plot the bifurcation
diagram in Fig. 1, indicating the stable, metastable and
unstable regions in the (c, S) representation and in the
inset we show the (µ, S) representation. Arrows indicate
the IN transition in both representations, for which the

With this deﬁnition, we can write n · ∇S = S(cid:48)(z) cos α,

where henceforth a prime denotes diﬀerentiation with re-
spect to z.

cause S(cid:48)(z) → 0 for z → ±∞. Taking the square root

of this equation and choosing the positive root since it is
consistent with our boundary conditions, it is straight-
forward to ﬁnd that the order parameter proﬁle reads

[35], we know that βγ(cid:107)LD = 0.156 (α = π/2), while
βγ⊥LD = 0.265 (α = 0). We thus ﬁnd m(cid:107) = 0.296L2,
and m⊥ = 0.854L2. For the perpendicular case (α = 0),
we plot the proﬁles c(z) and S(z) in Fig. 2, showing
that the density proﬁle is shifted with respect to the or-
der parameter proﬁle, which is consistent with Onsager

N > 1 for c (cid:38) 5 in Fig. 1, which is
unphysical. A simple remedy for this problem would be
to replace S4 → S4/(1 − S) in Eq. (5), which ensures
that S ≤ 1. However, this complicates the free energy,
especially when the full Q-tensor theory is needed, so
it will not considered here. We have seen in our cal-
culations that this remedy does give better results for
the nematic branches at high densities when compared
with Onsager theory. However, our calculations show
that inhomogeneous Landau theories are less accurate
for these expansions, presumably because accuracy in the
metastable regime is more important than in the high-
density regime.

IV.

ISOTROPIC-NEMATIC INTERFACE

Let us now consider an inhomogeneous system that for
z → ∞ consists of an isotropic ﬂuid, while for z → −∞
there is a bulk nematic with order parameter Sb. More-
over, we assume homogeneity in the plane perpendicular
to the z axis. As a natural consequence a planar interface
will develop between the two bulk phases, with an order
parameter proﬁle S(z) and a density proﬁle c(z), that
can be calculated within our Landau theory. The surface
tension for parallel γ(cid:107) and perpendicular anchoring γ⊥ of
such a system are known within Onsager theory [35] and
these quantities will be used to ﬁt the constants l1 and
ls = (l2 + l3)/2 from Eq. (6) below. We ﬁx the director
ﬁeld n to be spatially constant with a speciﬁed orienta-
tion and let α be the angle of the director with the inter-
face normal. This means that for α = 0 (α = π/2) the

found for α = 0, but the interfaces have a smaller width.
For the above obtained values of m(cid:107) and m⊥, it follows
using the relation below Eq. (18) that l1 = 0.165L2 and
ls = 0.837L2.
In this case it is not possible to deter-
mine la. Using these values, we ﬁnd K11/K22 = 6, which
should be contrasted with the exact relation where this
ratio should be equal to 3 for L → ∞ [27, 36, 37].
To assess the quality of our calculations, we introduce
two characteristic lengths. The ﬁrst one is deﬁned as
δ = |zS−zc|, where S(zS) = SIN /2 and c(zc) = [c(µIN )+
cI (µIN )]/2, hence we see that δ is a measure for the shift
of c(z) with respect to S(z). Another length scale is
the width of c(z), which can be deﬁned as τ = |z+ −
z−|, where z± satisﬁes c(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(z±) = 0. For α = 0, we ﬁnd
that δ(cid:107) = 0.223L and τ(cid:107) = 0.586L, while within Onsager
theory the values are δO(cid:107) = 0.45L [35] and τ O(cid:107) = 0.697L
[38]. Finally, for α = π/2, we have determined that δ⊥ =
0.378L and τ⊥ = 0.994L, however, the values of δO⊥ and
τ O⊥ are not reported in the literature. Where comparisons
are possible, we do see that the LdG results compare
quite favourably with Onsager theory, where one should
keep in mind the enormously reduced numerical eﬀort of
the LdG theory compared to the Onsager theory of the
IN interface.

V. RADIAL HEDGEHOG DEFECT

Figure 3. Internal structure of a hedgehog defect for various
chemical potentials µ. In (a) the order parameter proﬁle S(r)
is shown and in the inset we show a schematic top view of the
defect.
In (b) we plot the dimensionless local density c(r).
The proﬁles clearly show the structure of an isotropic core
centered at r = 0.

In this section, we will study the hedgehog defect,
an object that has received much attention in the ther-
motropic liquid crystal literature [39–42], but for which
little is known for lyotropic liquid crystals. To study this
type of defect, we assume locally uniaxial symmetry and
consider

where n(r) = er is the radial unit-vector. If the hedgehog
defect would consist of a bulk nematic phase, the elastic
free energy density diverges at the centre r = 0, and the
only way for the system to lower its free energy is by a
melting transition of the core to an isotropic phase. Lan-
dau theory allows us to determine the internal structure
of the resulting defect core, shown schematically in the
inset of Fig. 3. This calculation would not be possible
within continuum theories such as e.g. Eq. (10), in which
the spatial variation of S(r) is ignored. In such Frank-
Oseen theories, a cut-oﬀ length is needed to assess the
size of the isotropic core, whereas the core size will fol-
low naturally from the regime where S(r) vanishes within
our LdG theory. Finally, the rod length L is a natural
length scale in our calculations, because we determined
the stiﬀness constants m(cid:107) and m⊥ from a microscopic
theory. This allows us to estimate the isotropic core size
in terms of L.

Since we ﬁx the director ﬁeld to be radial, it suﬃces
to evaluate Eq. (5) and (9). A radial director ﬁeld is

to be solved for the boundary conditions S(0) = 0 and
S(R) = S+
N (µ). The radius R is the size of the hedgehog
defect, which can be thought of as the radius of a ﬁnite
spherulite or a bulk nematic where there is a ﬁnite region
of size R where the rods are radially aligned.
In our
calculations we set R = 50L. Notice that the surface
term in Eq. (6) does not contribute because we consider
strong homeotropic anchoring conditions at r = R.

Solving Eq. (26) for a given µ gives the structure of a
hedgehog defect S(r), shown in Fig. 3(a) for several µ.
Indeed, an isotropic core centered at the origin is found.
For r ↓ 0, the proﬁles behave locally as S(r) = O(r2)
and for r → ∞ as S(r) = S+
N (µ) − O(1/r2), as is well-
known [39]. Moreover, increasing µ, which is equivalent
to setting a higher bulk density, gives rise to a smaller
isotropic core size. This behaviour is also observed in
thermotropic Landau theory [39], however there are two
new features that our version provides. Firstly, as was
mentioned earlier, m⊥ is determined by a ﬁt to the On-
sager result, and hence the rod length L is an intrinsic
(microscopic) length scale of the theory. This allows us
to determine the isotropic core size in terms of L. We
see that the isotropic core size is always O(L) suﬃciently
far from the nematic spinodal, in accordance with exper-
iments [43]. This is in sharp contrast with thermotropic
liquid crystals, where the isotropic core size is macro-
scopic in size compared to the microscopic size of the
molecules, which have a length on the order of 10−9 m
[39]. The reason is that for thermotropics, the binodal
lies always close to the isotropic spinodal temperature T ∗
and the nematic spinodal temperature T+, since typically
T+ − T ∗ (cid:46) 1 K [8]. Secondly, from S(r) we can deter-

mine the density proﬁles c(r), for which we show some
examples in Fig. 3(b) for the same set of µ. Similar to
the planar interface case, c(r) is shifted with respect to
S(r) towards the region where the bulk nematic phase is
found.

The isotropic core size can be characterized by rS or
rc, the positions for which S(r) and c(r) attains the aver-
age of their minimum and maximum value, respectively,
which we show as a function of µ in Fig. 4(a). We see that
both quantities increase with decreasing µ, showing that
at low (bulk) densities the rods have a lower tendency to
order, which facilitates an isotropic phase. When µ ap-
proaches the nematic spinodal µ+, the core size diverges,
because the nematic phase becomes absolutely unstable.

6

However, it is hard to determine numerically the exact
state point for which this happens, because of conver-
gence problems in Eq. (26) for βµ (cid:46) 5.22.

We plot the interfacial shift δ = |rS − rc| in Fig. 4(b),
revealing a weak (but non-monotonic) variation with µ.
As a comparison we indicate δ⊥, which is the result found
in the ﬂat geometry of the previous section, as the dotted
horizontal line. We do not make a comparison with the
interfacial width τ since it is an ill-deﬁned quantity for
the hedgehog defect: the equation c(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(r) = 0 has only
one solution. Finally, we remark that the hedgehog de-
fect can be unstable towards a ring disclination or a split
core defect, as was found for thermotropic LdG theory
[41]. For hard rods the split core defect has been realized
by applying an external magnetic ﬁeld [44]. Ring discli-
nations, however, are expected not to occur in hard-rod
systems, because, in contrast to molecular systems, we
have K11 (cid:29) K33.

VI. CONFINED HARD RODS

An application for which we need the full Q-tensor the-
ory is the conﬁnement of rods in a rectangular cuboid.
Such a system has been investigated using a mean-ﬁeld
Onsager model and Frank-Oseen model [45], but also us-
ing Monte-Carlo simulations [46] and within Landau the-
ory [47]. In the latter case, however, local density varia-
tions were not considered.

Let us consider a rectangular cuboid with a square
base of dimensions l × l in the xy-plane as illustrated
in Fig. 5(a). To simplify the problem, we take the height
equal to the diameter of the rods, such that the rods will
necessarily order within the xy-plane. We implement this
by setting Qzz = −1/2 and Qzx = Qzy = 0. Following
Ref. [46], we use the largest positive eigenvalue λ+ of Q
to determine the degree of order, while the corresponding
eigenvector n is a measure for the alignment in the xy-
plane. Observe that λ+ is not always the same as the
scalar order parameter S, which is deﬁned as the absolute
largest eigenvalue. We parametrize

of 73/20×73/20 in units of rod length L and where the height
of the slab is chosen to be equal to the diameter D of the rods.
We ﬁx the anchoring strength w = 10 and anchoring parame-
ter ∆ = 0.1, and investigate their eﬀects on an isotropic state
(a)-(c) at chemical potential βµ = 2, while in (d)-(f) we con-
sider a nematic state βµ = 5. The bulk 2D IN transition
occurs at βµIN = 2.03 as explained in the text. The ordering
eﬀects of the walls can be seen in (a) where θ is the angle with
the x axis, while the degree of ordering is shown in (b) and
(e), and the density c in (c) and (f).

N = ρAD the number of rods and A = l2 the area,
such that c = (π/4)L2ρ2D, is a natural dimensionless
real density.

In Fig. 6 we show examples of the structures that can
be found for ∆ = 0.1 and l/L = 73/20. The latter system
size is chosen because it enables us to compare our results
with the simulations of Ref.
[46]. We consider βµ = 2
(2D isotropic) and βµ = 5 (nematic), which should be

− (3b− d)/(2a) = 2.03 where
the bulk phase transition in this 2D geometry takes place
according to our 3D-based LdG theory. In the isotropic
state for ∆ = 0.1, the rods align along the four walls,
while pointing their endpoints towards the corners along
the diagonals, as can be seen in Fig. 6(a) where we plot
the (minimal) angle θ of n with respect to the the x-axis.
Fig. 6(b) shows that the core is 2D isotropic since λ+ =
1/4, but close to the walls ordering is induced, λ+ > 1/4.
Furthermore, the density is lowest where the ordering is
the smallest, see Fig. 6(c). However, a complete study
of the wetting and pre-wetting properties of the walls is

Eq. (31)) the rods at the corners of the square have the same

various director conﬁgurations at the four corners. For

with anchoring paramater ∆, which allows us to study
metastable states that are otherwise hard to access. For
∆ = 0 this gives an equal weight to either of the two
conﬁgurations shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), whereas a bias
in the conﬁgurations of the director occurs when ∆ (cid:54)= 0.
For ∆ > 0 the conﬁguration of Fig. 5(d) is preferred
and for ∆ < 0 the conﬁguration of Fig. 5(e). Analogous
expressions can be derived for the other three boundaries
which we can summarize for (x, y) ∈ Γi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) as

with (x1, x2, x3, x4) = (x, y,−x,−y). Solving the set of
equations Eq.
(28), (29), (32) and (33) gives λ+(x, y)
and n(x, y) [48]. Moreover, within our Landau theory we
can extract the density c(x, y) = cI (µ) + (2a/3)Tr(Q2).
Interestingly, it turns out that c(x, y) is a good measure
for the local two-dimensional density ρ2D = N/A, with

move apart along the diagonal when the total density is
increased. When the center is perfectly ordered, λ+ =
1, the defects reside at ﬁxed positions, but not at the
corners. A combination of the various structures can be
found whenever ∆ is diﬀerent for the four boundaries.
An example is shown in Fig. 7(m)-(p) with ∆ = 0.5 on
Γ1 and Γ4, and ∆ = 0 on Γ2 and Γ3.

A competition of the wall-induced ordering and the
spontaneous nematic ordering always occurs beyond the
chemical potential for which the center starts to order.
Hence, we investigate λmid
+ ≡ λ+(0, 0) as function of µ,
shown for various system sizes l and anchoring parame-
ters ∆ in Fig. 8. We observe a second-order phase transi-
tion at µ > µ2D
IN , with a shift that depends on the system
size and on the nature of defects. In our calculations we
also observe that a smaller anchoring strength w shifts
the phase transition closer to the 2D bulk one, the same
as with increasing l. This can be understood from the ob-
servation that for the formation of a nematic phase in the
center, it is necessary to counteract the wall-ordering ef-
fects. When the wall-ordering eﬀects are stronger, which
happens at larger w or smaller l, a larger density and
hence a larger µ is needed to spontaneously order the
system.

Finally, we make some remarks on the location of
the bulk phase transition of the quasi 2D setup that
we have investigated here. Converting µ2D
IN to a den-
sity, we ﬁnd that the 2D bulk phase transition takes
place at c∗ = 1.95, which should be compared with
ρ∗
2D = 3π/2L2 or c∗
≈ 3.7 for the two-dimensional On-
sager model [34]. This signiﬁcant discrepancy can be un-
derstood from the fact that we have not properly included
the walls that conﬁne the rods in the xy-plane, we simply
set Qzz = −1/2 and Qzx = Qzy = 0. The Landau the-

out of the scope of this paper, since a more sophisticated
surface free energy may be needed [49]. In the nematic
state, there is a competition between the ordering eﬀects
of the wall and the density-induced order due to the rod-
rod interactions. This results in a lens-shaped director
ﬁeld structure (Fig. 6(d)), and for this speciﬁc boundary
condition it results in defects near two of the four corners
with an isotropic core shown in red in Fig. 6(e), with a
reduction in local density shown in blue in Fig. 6(f).

The type of possible structures are very sensitive to
the boundary conditions that we impose. In Fig. 7 we
show the various possibilities for diﬀerent values of ∆ as
function of µ. For ∆ = 0 we see in Fig. 7(a)-(d) that
order is always reduced at the four corners, but these
isotropic cores become smaller in size for larger µ. The
same happens when ∆ = 0.1 in Fig. 7(e)-(h), although
now only in two of the four corners a 2D isotropic phase
is found. In Fig. 7 (i)-(l) we set ∆ = 0.5 and see that
two defects are created at the center of the cell, which

ory that we use is, however, eﬀectively three-dimensional,
and the excluded volume interactions in two dimensions
are of a diﬀerent nature than in three dimensions. A bet-
ter construction of the LdG theory would include these
walls within a three-dimensional calculation. Another
alternative is to use a two-dimensional Landau theory
where the coeﬃcients are to be determined from the bi-
furcation diagram of a two-dimensional Onsager theory.
We expect that the qualitative features presented in this
case, however, will not change.

VII. NEMATIC DROPLET

Nematic droplets, or tactoids, diﬀer from droplets of
an isotropic ﬂuid because they are elongated rather than
spherical in shape. This has been observed in experi-
ments, where the defect structures in the nematic texture
have been investigated [50–54], but also in simulations
[55]. The shape of a tactoid can be determined within
continuum theory [56] by minimizing the combined elas-
tic and surface free energy

F = Fe +

∂Vdrop

dS[γ(cid:107) + (γ⊥ − γ(cid:107))(ˆν · n)2],

(34)

at a ﬁnite and given volume of the droplet Vdrop. Re-
call that the Frank elastic free energy Fe is given in Eq.
(10), and that γ(cid:107) (γ⊥) is the surface tension when the
rods are aligned parallel (perpendicular) to the interface.
Since the shape is an input parameter in the minimiza-
tion procedure of Eq. (34), one has to impose how the
rods align along the interface of the droplet, and this is
captured in the second term of Eq. (34). Minimization
of this free energy has been successful in determining the
shapes of tactoids. The surface tensions that are used as
ﬁt parameters to match the theory with the experimen-
tally observed shapes, however, disagree with the exper-
imentally measured and theoretically obtained values of
the surface tension [35, 38, 54, 57–62]. A hypothesis for
this discrepancy is due to the simple choice of the Rapini-
Papoular form [29] to describe the anchoring at the IN
interface, which is strictly speaking only true for a planar
(non-curved) geometry. The question is how much cur-
vature would renormalize the surface tensions of the ﬂat
geometry. Our aim is to calculate this within our Landau
theory, because the surface eﬀects of Eq. (34) should au-
tomatically be captured in our treatment. Such a calcu-
lation has been brieﬂy touched upon for the thermotropic
case in Ref. [63], although only in a two-dimensional xy-
geometry and with a focus on the time evolution rather
than on the equilibrium tactoid sizes and shapes.

For simplicity we focus on tactoids with a homogeneous
director ﬁeld, n = ez, with ez the unit vector in the z-
direction. For such a director ﬁeld all elasticity terms
vanish, and hence the Landau grand potential is given

by

.

It is easily seen that this free energy mimics the second
term in Eq. (34), with the identiﬁcation that the sur-
face normal ˆν is the same as ∇S on the surface deﬁned
by S(r∗) = (1/2) maxr∈V S(r). Thus, the square gradi-
ent term in Eq.
(35) is a surface tension contribution
that results in droplets that tend to minimize their sur-
face area, while the second term favours droplet shapes
for which the misalignment between surface normal and
director is minimal because m⊥ > m(cid:107).

It turns out to be numerically diﬃcult to ﬁnd non-
trivial solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations of Eq.
(35) that are spatially inhomogeneous. For this reason we
investigate instead a dynamical equation for S assuming
model-A (pseudo-)dynamics [64],

where Θ is the Heaviside step function, r0 is the radius
ρ2 + z2, in terms of the
of the initial droplet and r =
cylindrical coordinates (ρ, z). Our goal is to look at a
ﬁxed µ for stationary solutions of Eq. (36), since they
would also be solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations.
If we use Eq. (36) for a ﬁxed r0, we only ﬁnd solutions for
which droplets keep growing if µ is too large, or droplets
that keep shrinking if µ is too small. Consequently, there
must be a critical chemical potential µc for which the
droplet neither grows or shrinks when the optimal shape
is attained. To ﬁnd µc for a certain shape and droplet
volume we ﬁx µ0 = µ(t = 0) and evaluate instead of Eq.

We solve Eq. (41) and Eq. (42), using the boundary
condition Eq. (37) and initial condition Eq. (38) where
we take for the system volume a cylinder of radius 20L
and height 20L, using the xy-plane as a symmetry plane.

When r0 and µ0 are too small, the initial droplet dis-
appears in time, but when they are chosen too big the
droplet will eventually touch the system boundary and a
“planar” interface along the radial direction will develop.
However, here we will only consider the set of values for
µ0 and r0 that give stable droplets that do not change
over time: this deﬁnes µc = µ0 + ∆µ(t → ∞).
In Fig. 9(a)-(c) we show the typical relaxation of a
spherical droplet as function of dimensionless time t(cid:48) =
ΓL3t/(βB2) towards an elongated shape within our LdG
theory, with the proﬁles along the two coordinate axes
shown in Fig. 9(d) and (e). Our LdG theory allows also
for the calculation of c(ρ, z) using Eq. (14), which we
show in Fig. 9(f)-(h) and in Fig. 9(i)-(j) along the two
symmetry axes. The stationary solution that we ﬁnd
has a higher chemical potential than the bulk binodal,
µc > µIN , which accounts for the Laplace pressure in
this ensemble.

Interestingly, the solution found for long times is very
similar to the IN planar interface at coexistence. This is

11

lower values of the “Laplace pressure”, µc − µIN , we ﬁnd
larger droplets, as indicated by a larger R1, although the
diﬀerences are not large among the various ﬁnal droplet
sizes. However, regardless the ﬁnal size, the aspect ratio
is always 1.7, which is illustrated by the various colored
lines in Fig. 10(b) converging to the dotted grey line.
This is only to be expected when curvature eﬀects are
not important, which is also found within the macro-
scopic theory of Eq. (34) for homogeneous director ﬁelds
with γ⊥ and γ(cid:107) constant. However, we expect that γ⊥
and γ(cid:107) depend on curvature. Moreover, in experiments
[50–54], it is concluded that (i) the aspect ratio depends
on R1, (ii) the aspect ratio can become as large as 4 to 5
and (iii) the experimentally observed shapes have cusps
at the endpoints on the axis parallel to the director ﬁeld
when the aspect ratio is larger than 2. Only very large
droplets are expected to have an aspect ratio of 1.7.

Clearly,

increasing the aspect ratio is only possible
within our theory by tuning the ratio m⊥/m(cid:107). Indeed,
we ﬁnd in our calculations that we can obtain any desired
aspect ratio by varying this quantity. Moreover, to make
R1/R2 depend on the droplet size and hence on µc−µIN ,
the coeﬃcients m⊥ and m(cid:107) need to depend on µ. This
does not come as a surprise, since l1 and ls are in general
µ dependent. However, since m⊥ = (2/3)(l1 + 4ls/3) and
m(cid:107) = (2/3)(l1 +ls/3) we ﬁnd that the maximal aspect ra-
tio that can be achieved by tuning l1 and ls is R1/R2 = 2,
while keeping l1, ls > 0. However, we have to go to ex-
treme limits to achieve this behaviour, l1 should be close
to zero or ls very large.

Another possibility to achieve a higher aspect ratio is
by including higher order terms in the Landau expansion.
The next order term has two derivatives and is third or-
der in Q. There are many symmetry-allowed terms that
satisfy this condition, however the only one that does not
generate any new elasticity contributions and hence the
only one that is quadratic in n is the term

see Ref. [66], which holds for the uniaxial case. Another
motivation why such a term is needed, is that it lifts the
degeneracy on K11 and K33, which is also found within
Onsager theory [27], but not in LdG theory if the square
gradient terms are only quadratic in Q, see section II
below Eq. (10).

Clearly, including Eq. (43) increases γ⊥, which is re-
ﬂected by the positive sign of the ﬁrst term. In contrast
γ(cid:107) is reduced, since the second term is negative. Conse-
quently, for l4 > 0, the aspect ratio R1/R2 is increased.
To reproduce the ﬂat plane result for large droplets we
expand l4 = l0
4 > 0,
and tried to do the calculation with this contribution [67].
By construction larger droplets will have an aspect ratio
closer to R1/R2 = 1.7, since µc will be closer to µIN .
While it was rather straightforward to get R1/R2 ∼ 2 by
tuning l0
4, we found numerical diﬃculties when we tried

indicated by the interfacial shift δ and interfacial width
τ . We ﬁnd for S(ρ, 0) and c(ρ, 0) that δρ = 0.219L and
τρ = 0.576L to be compared with the ﬂat plane result
of δ(cid:107) = 0.223L and τ(cid:107) = 0.586L. Along the z axis we
ﬁnd δz = 0.372L and τz = 0.978L to be compared with
δ⊥ = 0.378L and τ⊥ = 0.994L. This shows that the
surface tensions in both directions are eﬀectively reduced
for µ > µIN , since τ is smaller. However, from scaling
arguments [65], we ﬁnd that for γ⊥ the relevant length
scale is L − (1/2)d2/L, with d the possible displacement
of the rods given the orientation distribution function. In
contrast, for γ(cid:107) the relevant length scale is d. A higher µ
is equivalent to a higher density and hence lower d. From
the above scaling arguments we deduce that γ⊥ should
increase with µ while γ(cid:107) should decrease, which is not
captured in our calculation.

This latter observation is relevant when we investigate
the aspect ratio R1/R2 of the stationary droplets, with
R1 the length of the main axis and R2 the one of the
minor axis, see the inset of Fig. 10(a). It turns out that
we always ﬁnd R1/R2 = 1.7, which equals the ratio of
the surface tensions determined from the planar geom-
(23). Starting with
diﬀerent values of µ0 and r0 (or even changing the as-
pect ratio of the initial droplet) we observe that µc only
depends on µ0, see Fig. 10(a). For small µc, and hence

etry γ⊥/γ(cid:107) = (cid:112)m⊥/m(cid:107), see Eq.

R1=L05101520R1=R211.522.53t00100200-7(t0)5.25.35.45.55.6(b)(a)R1R2to ﬁnd a larger aspect ratio, because adding Eq.
(43)
introduces extra non-linearities in the Euler-Lagrange
equation. Moreover, within all of our calculations, no
cusps were found, while they are always experimentally
observed for R1/R2 (cid:38) 2. We hypothesize that for the ex-
istence of these cusps is essential to have a large aspect ra-
tio, and we speculate here that we cannot ﬁnd such solu-
tions due to the adopted square-gradient approximation.
Another possibility would be that model-A dynamics is
not suitable to ﬁnd these cusp(-like) solutions. Finally,
we neglect any bipolarness in the director-ﬁeld texture
that may also be important [54, 60].
It would be in-
teresting to use the full Q-tensor theory to capture this
eﬀect, since it is known within the macroscopic theory of
Eq. (34) that R1/R2 depends on R1 when bipolarness is
included, even when γ⊥ and γ(cid:107) are taken to be constant.
Despite its shortcomings here and there, our theory
does show that adding a µ-dependent elasticity term to
the free energy allows us to predict an aspect ratio of
R1/R2 = 1.7 − 2 that depends on the droplet size. The
larger the droplet, the smaller R1/R2 since the “Laplace
pressure” is smaller.
If the elastic coeﬃcients are as-
sumed to be constant, we ﬁnd no curvature eﬀects on
R1/R2. An improvement of the theory to obtain cusp-
like solutions is needed, however. We expect that the
cusps have a strong renormalizing eﬀect on the surface
tensions so that experimentally observed aspect ratios
around 4 can be achieved. The existence of these cusps is
expected to be more important than that of the “Laplace
pressure”, which turns out to be important whenever
R1/R2 ∼ 2.

VIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have constructed a Landau theory for hard rods
by a suitable order parameter expansion of the grand
potential. The coeﬃcients are determined by ﬁtting them
to the bulk coexistence data and the surface tensions in
a planar geometry. This is diﬀerent from the approach
of Ref.
[22] where the Frank elastic coeﬃcients from a
fundamental measure theory [68] are used to determine
the square gradient coeﬃcients. We have compared our
results with known properties of Onsager theory, such as
the (bulk) bifurcation diagram and characteristic length
scales of the IN interface.

The remainder of the paper was a demonstration of the
resulting Landau theory in more complex situations. In
the ﬁrst two sections we gave examples that were inves-
tigated before within Landau theory, but not yet within
a density-dependent one. We showed that we can as-

12

sess the isotropic core size in hedgehog defects in terms
of the rod length L and investigated how the isotropic
core size depends on the bulk density. Suﬃciently far
from the spinodal, we found a core size that is on the
order of the length of the constituent particles, in con-
trast to a thermotropic hedgehog defect, which has a core
size that is much larger than the length of the constituent
molecules. In section VI we studied the evolution of topo-
logical defects as function of density in conﬁned quasi
two-dimensional geometries and examined the eﬀects of
various boundary conditions. The last section describes
a novel application to ﬁnd the curvature dependence of
the surface tension in a self-consistent manner to explain
the discrepancy between measurements and theoretical
predictions of the surface tension for tactoids. Our calcu-
lations showed that the “Laplace pressure” renormalizes
the surface tensions of the ﬂat geometry for the perpen-
dicular and parallel anchoring conditions, provided that
a higher order µ-dependent elastic coeﬃcient is included.
However, cusps in the equilibrium shapes of the tactoids
are not found, and are expected be important for the
renormalization of the surface tensions.

We remark that the construction of the LdG theory
is completely general. There are various ways of deter-
mining the coeﬃcients, for which we have only shown
one example. Moreover, these coeﬃcients do not nec-
essarily need to be ﬁtted to Onsager theory, but can
also be determined from comparisons with other theo-
ries for (hard) rods, such as fundamental measure theory
[22], or experiments and simulations. An interesting ap-
plication would be to determine the Landau coeﬀcients
from Khokhlov-Semenov theory to describe semi-ﬂexible
chains [18, 69, 70]. Furthermore, we only studied the
grand-canonical ensemble, however, for bulk systems it
is also possible to consider the Gibbs free energy, where
the pressure is the relevant intensive variable to be tuned
to describe the density-dependent IN transition for hard
rods. Ultimately, the ﬁnal application determines which
method is optimal. Finally, we hope that our ﬁndings
will help to provide (qualitative) insights into problems
that can be very hard to tackle within (inhomogeneous)
Onsager theory or extensions thereof.

APPENDIX A: EULER-LAGRANGE EQUATIONS FOR RODS IN SQUARE CONFINEMENT

In this appendix we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations that we used in section VI. For this we have to minimize
∆Ω with respect to Q while taking into account that Q is traceless and symmetric, and that the order occurs in the

(x, y) plane. Therefore, we introduce the Lagrange multipliers λB, κB
and for the surface we introduce likewise λS, κS

ρ and ξS.

The eﬀect of the Lagrange multipliers κρ is to symmetrize Eq. (45) over the indices α and β. A similar calculation
can be performed to determine the surface Lagrange multipliers. Combining Eq. (45)-(47) and Eq. (50) results in
the Euler-Lagrange equations Eq. (28) and boundary condition Eq. (29).
