ABSTRACT

The accretion of the stellar wind material by a compact object represents the main mechanism powering the X-ray emission in
classical supergiant high mass X-ray binaries and supergiant fast X-ray transients. In this work we present the ﬁrst attempt to simulate
the accretion process of a fast and dense massive star wind onto a neutron star, taking into account the eﬀects of the centrifugal and
magnetic inhibition of accretion (“gating”) due to the spin and magnetic ﬁeld of the compact object. We made use of a radiative
hydrodynamical code to model the non-stationary radiatively driven wind of an O-B supergiant star and then place a neutron star
characterized by a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld and spin period at a certain distance from the massive companion. Our calculations follow,
as a function of time (on a total time scale of several hours), the transition of the system through all diﬀerent accretion regimes that
are triggered by the intrinsic variations in the density and velocity of the non-stationary wind. The X-ray luminosity released by
the system is computed at each time step by taking into account the relevant physical processes occurring in the diﬀerent accretion
regimes. Synthetic lightcurves are derived and qualitatively compared with those observed from classical supergiant high mass X-
ray binaries and supergiant fast X-ray transients. Although a number of simpliﬁcations are assumed in these calculations, we show
that taking into account the eﬀects of the centrifugal and magnetic inhibition of accretion signiﬁcantly reduces the average X-ray
luminosity expected for any neutron star wind-fed binary. The present model calculations suggest that long spin periods and stronger
magnetic ﬁelds are favoured in order to reproduce the peculiar behavior of supergiant fast X-ray transients in the X-ray domain.

1. Introduction

Most of the supergiant high mass X-ray binaries (SGXBs), in-
cluding the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), host a
neutron star (NS) accreting from the fast and dense wind of a
massive O-B supergiant companion. The accretion of the stel-
lar wind material onto the compact object power a conspicuous
X-ray emission (see Walter et al. 2015, for a recent review).

The so called “classical” SGXBs are typically characterized
by a relatively constant average X-ray luminosity. Depending
mostly on the orbital separation between the NS and the com-
panion, this can range from 1034 erg s−1 to 1037 erg s−1 and dis-
play a short term variability achieving a dynamic range in the
X-ray luminosity of 10 −100 over timescales of hundred to thou-
sand seconds. The SFXTs are known, instead, to display a much
more extreme behavior in the X-ray domain. These sources re-
main in quiescence (LX ∼ 1032 − 1033 erg s−1) for most of the
time and only sporadically undergo short and bright outbursts,
reaching a luminosity comparable to that of the classical systems
(LX ∼ 1036 −1037 erg s−1). The dynamical range of the SFXT X-
ray luminosity can thus achieve values as large as ∆LX∼105-106.
The outbursts of these sources last for a few hours at the most,
and thus their activity duty cycle is estimated to be typically
of a few % (Lutovinov et al. 2013; Romano et al. 2011, 2014a;
Paizis & Sidoli 2014; Bozzo et al. 2015). In virtually all SFXTs
it was also observed that X-ray ﬂares reaching a luminosity of
1-10% of that of the brightest outbursts can occur at anytime,
displaying timing and spectral properties similar to those of the

more luminous events (see, e.g., Sidoli et al. 2008; Bozzo et al.
2010; Bodaghee et al. 2010; Romano et al. 2013, 2014b).

The spectroscopic properties of the SFXT X-ray emission
is typical of wind accreting NS systems, and can be usually
described by using a power-law model with a cut-oﬀ around
10-30 keV (see, e.g., Romano et al. 2008; Sidoli et al. 2009;
Romano 2015). Soft thermal components have been detected in
the X-ray spectra of the SFXTs both during outbursts and qui-
escence. In the ﬁrst case, these components are mostly ascribed
to hot spots on the NS surface, while in quiescence the ther-
mal emission could be more easily explained as being produced
within the wind of the supergiant companion (Bozzo et al. 2010;
Sidoli et al. 2010).

The winds of OB supergiants are indeed well known to pro-
duce a relatively bright X-ray emission that could reach values
of 1034 erg s−1 in the most extreme cases. The origin of these X-
rays is still highly debated, but one of the most credited hypoth-
esis is that they are produced due to the collision of “clumps”
in the stellar wind, i.e. structures characterized by a higher den-
sity and a diﬀerent velocity compared to the surrounding intra-
clump medium (see, e.g., Feldmeier 1995; Oskinova et al. 2006,
and references therein). One of the stellar wind models devel-
oped to study the formation of clumps and the release of X-ray
radiation from their collisions was presented by Feldmeier et al.
(1997b). This radiatively non-stationary wind model allows us
to carry out an hydrodynamic investigation of the wind forma-
tion and evolution from the ﬁrst principles, together with the
computation of the thermal structure of the wind and the en-
ergy distribution of the emitted radiation. The model uses a 1D

1

approach and thus the clumps can grow signiﬁcantly in size and
density due to the lack of the other two spatial dimensions that
would allow us to observe the lateral break-up of these structures
as a consequence of the Rayleigh-Taylor or thin-shell instability
(Dessart & Owocki 2003, 2005). Multi-dimensional simulations
(mostly 2D and pseudo 3D), however, were so far unable to ac-
count for the thermal structure of the wind and thus they could
not make any clear prediction on the intensity of the produced
X-ray radiation to be compared with observations of isolated
OB supergiants and massive stars in SGXBs (see, e.g., Puls et al.
2008). More recent ﬁndings seem to suggest that clumps might
likely be limited to a density ratio of ∼10 compared to the sur-
rounding medium and a lateral extent of the order of 10% of
the supergiant star radius (see, e.g., ˇSurlan et al. 2013, and refer-
ences therein).

The possibility of having massive and dense structures in
the winds of supergiant stars, as predicted by the 1D ap-
proach of stellar wind models mentioned above, stimulated
the idea that
the SFXTs might have been a sub-class of
SGXBs hosting massive stars with extreme clumpy winds
(in’t Zand 2005; Negueruela et al. 2006; Walter & Zurita Heras
2007; Negueruela et al. 2007; Bozzo et al. 2011). The accretion
of a massive clump onto the NS would produce in this scenario
bright and short X-ray outbursts, as the duration of the event
is related to the lateral size of the clump while the total lumi-
nosity is directly proportional to its mass. Less luminous ﬂares
can be explained by invoking a reasonable distribution in mass
and size of the clumps (in’t Zand 2005; Walter & Zurita Heras
2007). The quiescent emission of the SFXT can be interpreted
in this scenario by assuming that in this case the NS is accret-
ing through the much more rareﬁed intra-clump medium, which
particularly low density can only provide a feeble mass accretion
rate onto the compact object.

The ﬁrst attempt to combine non-stationary stellar wind
codes with calculations on the expected accretion luminosity
produced by a NS located inside the wind was presented by
Oskinova et al. (2012b). These authors assumed the simplest
accreting scenario in which all the stellar wind material grav-
itationally captured by the NS is accreted onto the compact
object. Their calculations showed that the extremely clumpy
wind produced by the 1D code gives rise to a large X-ray
variability reaching a dynamic range of 106-107. Even though
this is compatible with the dynamic range displayed by the
SFXTs, the overall behaviour observed in the simulations of
Oskinova et al. (2012b) did not resemble that typically observed
from the sources in this class. In particular, the model failed to
reproduce the SFXT low duty cycle, as bright outbursts were
predicted to repeat irregularly at any time without the presence
of extended periods of quiescence.

As discussed by Bozzo et al. (2015), it is likely that ex-
tremely clumpy winds are not enough to explain the complex
phenomenology of the SFXTs: some additional mechanism is
needed to halt the accretion onto the NS for a large fraction
of time and reproduce the low duty cycles of these systems
(see also Romano et al. 2014a; Sidoli et al. 2016). Bozzo et al.
(2008, hereafter B08) proposed that the inhibition of accretion
could occur in the SFXTs due to a peculiarly intense magnetic
ﬁeld and slow rotation of the compact object1. The NS rotation
and magnetic ﬁeld were indeed shown to give rise to a cen-
trifugal and magnetic gate that can inhibit accretion through ei-

the accretion in the SFXTs and produce sporadic bright outbursts (see
Shakura et al. 2014).

ther the on-set of a propeller eﬀect (Illarionov & Sunyaev 1975;
Grebenev & Sunyaev 2007) or preventing the gravitational fo-
cusing of the wind material toward the NS.

In this paper, we made a step forward compared to the sim-
ulations presented by Oskinova et al. (2012b) and show how the
magnetic and centrifugal gating mechanisms proposed by B08
would work in presence of a non-stationary clumpy stellar wind.
Our aim is to provide a reﬁned calculation of the accretion lu-
minosity that arise in wind accreting systems and investigate on
time scales spanning several hours if the centrifugal and mag-
netic gating mechanisms can help reproducing the characteristic
behaviour of the SFXTs in the X-ray domain. In Sect. 2 we sum-
marize the main properties of the 1D clumpy wind model already
used by Oskinova et al. (2012b), and provide a brief description
of the gating accretion models of B08 in Sect. 3. The results ob-
tained by taking into account the gating mechanisms during the
accretion of the clumpy stellar wind material onto a NS are de-
scribed in Sect. 4. We provide our discussion and conclusions in
Sect. 5.

2. Clumpy winds

To simulate the wind of the OB supergiant star hosted in a SGXB
or SFXT we use the results from hydrodynamic simulations that
derive the dynamics as well as the thermal structure of a line
driven stellar wind from the ﬁrst principles (see Feldmeier 1995;
Feldmeier et al. 1997b,a, for more details). This is the same
model adopted by Oskinova et al. (2012a) which predicts highly
structured and non-stationary stellar winds with large density
and velocity gradients. In the model, clumps are produced as
a consequence of the line-driven instability (LDI; Lucy & White
1980). The unstable growth of this instability is triggered by seed
perturbations at the base of the wind in form of turbulent vari-
ations of velocity and density at a level of roughly one third of
the sound speed. These perturbations have a coherence time of
1.4 hr, which is close to the acoustic cutoﬀ period of the model
star. The assumed stellar parameters are typical of a late O-type
supergiant, but it was shown that the predicted stellar wind dy-
namic structures of the model are not sensitive to (reasonable)
variations in the input stellar parameters.

Figure 1 shows a snapshot at a ﬁxed time of the wind struc-
ture produced by the model as a function of the distance from the
massive star. The model predicts a quasi-continuous hierarchy of
density and velocity structures in the wind, where dense shells
are formed relatively close to the star during a ﬁrst stage of unsta-
ble growth of the LDI. The dense shells have rather small radial
extent, low electron temperatures (Te ∼10 kK) and contain the
bulk of the wind mass. The colloquial term “wind clumps” refers
to these dense shells. The space between the shells is ﬁlled by
low density gas, which is usually termed “intra-clump” medium.
Besides the dense cool shells and the tenuous intra-clump
medium, there is a third type of structure. These structures can
be described as small “clouds” that are accelerated by the stellar
radiation ﬁeld and eventually collide with the next-outer dense
shell. The collisions between clouds and shell are the mecha-
nism through which the model produces the X-ray emission with
properties close to those observed from early type stars at high
energies (Feldmeier et al. 1997b,a; Oskinova et al. 2006).

In these time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations,

the
time-averaged velocity ﬁeld of the stellar wind follows the so-
called β-law, vw(r) = v∞(1 − 1/r)β, where v∞ is the wind ter-
minal speed and r is the distance from the center of the massive
star in units of the stellar radius. Such velocity ﬁeld is naturally
obtained as an outcome of the hydrodynamical model. Strong

Fig. 1. A snapshot at a ﬁxed time of the density stratiﬁcation (upper panel) and velocity ﬁeld (lower panel) of the stellar wind in a
O9.5 supergiant star, as predicted by time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations described in Sect. 2. The upper panel shows that the
wind density can change by several orders of magnitude due to the presence of “clumps”. The corresponding strong wind velocity
jumps are visible in the lower panel.

velocity jumps are produced in the model, with negative gradi-
ents across the shells. Even relatively close to the star, the wind
velocity can change by hundreds of km/s within a few hours. The
model includes the incremental growth of the optical depth due
to multiple resonances in a non-monotonic velocity ﬁeld, and
is able to resolve the cooling zones behind strong shocks. This
provides a complete and detailed hydrodynamic description of
the stellar wind (radiation, temperature, density, and velocity),
which is currently possible only in similar 1D models.

3. Gated accretion models

In this section we review the gating accretion model presented by
B08 that illustrates all the diﬀerent accretion regimes that a NS
hosted in a SGXB or an SFXT can experience (see also Lipunov
1987; Lipunov et al. 1992, for previous treatments of the wind
accretion regimes). At odds with the more simpliﬁed approach
of the Bondi-Hoyle accretion (see Appendix. A) adopted by
Oskinova et al. (2012b), the gating accretion model takes into
account the eﬀect produced onto the accretion ﬂow by the NS
spin and magnetic ﬁeld. The characteristics and the main phys-
ical processes dominating the X-ray emission in each accretion
regime are brieﬂy summarized below. We refer the reader to the
original paper of B08 for further details on the model and on all
involved assumptions. We ﬁrst deﬁne:

– The accretion radius, Ra, that is the distance from the NS at
which the inﬂowing stellar wind material is gravitationally
focused toward the compact object:

Ra = 2GMNS/v2

rel ∼ 3.7 × 1010v−2

8 cm,

(1)

– The magnetospheric radius, RM, at which the pressure of the
NS magnetic ﬁeld balances the ram pressure of the inﬂowing
matter. If the magnetospheric radius is larger than the accre-
tion radius Ra, the former can be calculated as:
1/3
33 cm.
µ

RM = RM1 = 1.3 × 1010ρ−1/6

−12 v−1/3

(2)

8

Here2 µ33 = µ/1033 G cm3 is the NS dipolar magnetic ﬁeld
and ρ−12=ρw/(10−12 g cm−3) is the density of the stellar wind
close to the compact object.

– The corotation radius, Rco, at which the velocity of the NS
spin rotation equals the local Keplerian angular velocity, i.e.

Rco = 1.7 × 1010P2/3

s3 cm,

(3)

10dM1/3

where Ps3 is the NS spin period in units of 103 s.
We additionally deﬁne the orbital separation between the NS
and the supergiant companion as a = 4.2×1012a10d cm, where
a10d=P2/3
30 , P10d is the binary orbital period in units of 10
days, and M30 is the total mass of the system (NS + supergiant
companion) in units of 30 M⊙. We assume in all cases a circular
orbit, as done originally in B08. Note that all radii deﬁned above
are much smaller than the supergiant radius and the radial extent
of the clump structures mentioned in Sect. 2, thus justifying the
usage of the 1D model for these systems.

The conditions under which the diﬀerent accretion regimes
can set-in depend mostly on the relative position of the accre-
tion radius, the corotational radius, and the mangetospheric ra-
dius. As shown by the equations above, the corotation radius is
only a function of the NS spin period and can thus be consid-
ered constant once Pspin is ﬁxed3. The accretion radius and the

where vrel is the relative velocity of the NS compared to the
stellar wind and v8 is the stellar wind velocity in units of
1000 km s−1. It has been assumed here for simplicity that the
orbital velocity of the NS is negligible compared to vw (as
done also in B08).

2 We approximated a-RM≃a, which is satisﬁed for a very wide range

of parameters of interest for the HMXBs considered in this paper.

3 In this paper we will only consider accretion processes over rela-
tively short timescales (hours to days) compared to those on which we
expect the NS spin period to change signiﬁcantly as a consequence of
accretion torques (see B08).

Fig. 3. Results of the simulations of the accretion onto a NS using the non-stationary wind model introduced in Sect. 2 and taking
into account the gating accretion mechanisms described in Sect. 3. The system parameters adopted in the simulation are shown
on the top of each ﬁgure (note that a separation of 2.5 R∗ corresponds to an orbital period of 9.1 days). The left ﬁgure reports the
wind velocity and density as a function of time, and all relevant radii to be determined in the gating accretion model. In the density
panel we also show with a red dashed line the value of the critical density in Eq. 13. The right ﬁgure shows in all its panels the
diﬀerent contributions to the total X-ray luminosity of the system. The latter is reported in the lowermost panel, together with the
corresponding X-ray luminosity that would be achieved by assuming the simplest Bondi-Hoyle scenario (magenta solid line; see
Appendix A). Empty regions in each panel represent time intervals in which the corresponding quantity is not calculated as the
source is not in that speciﬁc accretion regime (or it is out of scale and thus negligible for the overall luminosity budget; see Sect. 4
for details).

magnetospheric radius are, instead, strongly dependent from the
properties of the stellar wind and can thus change signiﬁcantly if
the properties of the medium surrounding the compact object are
altered, e.g., by the presence of a clump. We have to distinguish
a number of diﬀerent possibilities, as illustrated in the following
sections.

3.1. RM1>Ra
We begin by considering the case in which the magnetospheric
radius is larger than the accretion radius. Before entering the de-
tails of the X-ray emission released in this regime we further
have to distinguish between the two cases below:
– RM1≥Rco. If RM1>Ra and RM1>Rco, we are in the so called
super-Keplerian magnetic inhibition regime. In this case,
both the magnetic and the centrifugal gates are closed and
inhibit the accretion onto the NS. In particular, the magnetic

4

gate prevents matter for being gravitationally focused toward
the NS and the centrifugal gate propels away the material
along the magnetospheric boundary of the compact object.
The X-ray luminosity of the system is dominated in this
case by the energy released in the shocks occurring close
the magnetospheric boundary (RM=RM1) and by friction be-
tween the rotating NS magnetosphere and the surrounding
material. We thus have:

LX = Lshock + Lsd1 ,

we are in the sub- Keplerian magnetic inhibition of accre-
tion. Matter is still not gravitationally focused toward the
compact object but since the propeller eﬀect is not eﬀec-
tive, the material passing along the magnetospheric bound-
ary of the compact object is not pushed away and can accrete
mainly through the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (hereafter
KHI). As shown by B08, the total X-ray luminosity is given

We assume for the present work the reasonable value of 0.5
for the ratio between the wind density material inside (ρi)
and outside (ρe) the compact object mangetospheric bound-
ary. We also use a standard value for the parameter of the
KHI eﬃciency ηKH = 0.1 (B08). Higher values of this quan-
tity will only slightly increase the X-ray luminosity in the
sub-Keplerian magnetic inhibition regime but do not quali-
tatively change the results discussed in Sect. 4.

3.2. RM1<Ra
When the magnetospheric radius RM1<Ra, the magnetic gate is
open and the inﬂowing material from the stellar wind can be
gravitationally focused toward the compact object, ﬁlling the
space between Ra and the magnetospheric radius. This material

redistributes itself into an approximately spherical conﬁguration,
resembling an atmosphere, whose shape and properties are de-
termined by the interaction with the rotating NS magnetosphere
at the magnetospheric boundary.

The equation deﬁning the magnetospheric radius changes as
the pressure of the material is now computed assuming an hy-

In the above equation cs(RM)=vﬀ (RM)=(2GMNS/RM)1/2 is
the sound velocity in the shell of material surrounding the

– RM2<Rco: if RM2 is no longer larger than the corotation ra-
dius, then both the magnetic and centrifugal gates are open
and the inﬂowing stellar wind material can begin penetrating
the NS magnetosphere and accretes onto the compact object.
In this situation, the rotational velocity of the NS magneto-

Accretion at full regime can however take place only when
there is a suﬃciently high density outside RM3, such that
the inﬂowing wind material can cool down rapidly and
the magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities at the NS magneto-
spheric boundary reach the highest eﬃciency in transporting
material inside the NS magnetosphere. The critical density
above which accretion occurs at full regime (i.e. comparable
with the accretion rate in the Bondi-Hoyle approximation) is
given by:

(13)

where RM10=RM3/1010.
We thus still have to distinguish among two additional cases:
– If ρ−12<ρlim−12, then accretion does not achieve the high-
est eﬃciency and the system enters the subsonic pro-
peller regime. It can be shown that the main contribu-
tions to the total released X-ray luminosity is provided
by the partly limited accretion allowed by the KHI and
the friction between the material surrounding the NS and
its magnetosphere:

LX = LKH3 + Lsd3 ,

where:

– If ρ−12≥ρlim−12, then all conditions are satisﬁed for accre-

rect accretion regime. In this case the mass accretion rate
is comparable to the Bondi-Hoyle approximation and we
have:

All equations in this section have been re-adapted from B08
to be used within the clumpy wind code described in Sect. 2.
This code provides the value of the wind velocity v8 and the
density ρ−12 as a function of time at the NS location (which is a
ﬁxed parameter). These values are ﬁrst used to determine which
accretion regime the system is experiencing at a certain time and
then estimate the corresponding X-ray luminosity. A schematic
version of the ﬂow of conditions that lead the code to establish
the relevant accretion regime of the system and compute the X-
ray luminosity at each time step is shown in Fig. 2.

4. Results

We present in this section the results obtained by simulating the
accretion of the clumpy wind model in Sect. 2 onto a strongly
magnetized rotating NS. The main parameter to be ﬁxed for the
clumpy wind model is the distance between the compact object
and the massive companion, i.e. the orbital separation. As we
discussed in Sect. 2 the properties of the stellar wind change
at diﬀerent distances from the massive stars, thus aﬀecting the
physical properties of the accretion ﬂow that approaches the NS
as a function of time. We discuss below the two cases in which
the NS is located at a=2.5R∗ and 5R∗ from the massive com-
panion, (here R∗ is the supergiant radius). As we considered in
all cases a supergiant star with a mass of 34 M⊙ and a radius of
24 R⊙, the above separations correspond to a NS orbital period
of 9.1 and 25.6 days, respectively (a circular orbit is assumed in
all cases as we cannot simulate in the present set-up the eﬀect of
a non-negligible eccentricity). In order to probe diﬀerent com-
binations of the accretion regimes, we also considered diﬀerent
cases for the NS magnetic ﬁeld and spin period. In particular, we
report here on the three cases in which: (i) Ps3 = 1 and µ33 = 0.1;
(ii) Ps3 = 1 and µ33 = 0.001; (iii) Ps3 = 0.01 and µ33 = 0.001.
The ﬁrst of this possibility is more representative of the accretion
onto slowly rotating “magnetars”, i.e. NS endowed with partic-
ularly strong magnetic ﬁelds. The second and the third cases are
more representative of the case of a normal pulsar in a SGXBs,
endowed with a standard magnetic ﬁeld of 1012 G and a longer
or shorter spin period.

4.1. Orbitalperiod9.1days

We show the outcomes of the combination of the clumpy wind
code with the diﬀerent accretion regimes for an orbital period of
9.1 days in Fig. 3, 4, and 5.

The ﬁrst of these ﬁgures show the fastest spin period (Ps3 =
0.01) and lowest magnetic ﬁeld (µ33 = 0.001) case considered
in this paper. The two uppermost panels of Fig. 3 (left) show the
velocity and density evolution as a function of time computed
within the clumpy wind model in Sect. 2. In the density panel,
we also over-plot with a dashed red line the value of the criti-
cal density in Eq. 13. The other panels show from bottom to top
the diﬀerent magnetospheric radii RM1, RM2, and RM3, applica-
ble to the diﬀerent accretion regimes and measured in units of
the corotation radius Rco. We also display in the same units the
accretion radius, Ra. Depending on the relative position of these
radii, it can be understood how changes in the local environment
surrounding the NS trigger the switch between diﬀerent accre-
tion regimes (see Fig. 2). In the other panels of the ﬁgure, we
report the values of the luminosity contribution of each accretion
regime to the total X-ray emission. The latter is reported on the
bottom panel (red solid line), together with the X-ray luminosity
that the system would display in case the simplest Bondi-Hoyle
approximation is assumed (as done in Oskinova et al. 2012b, see
also Appendix A).

For the low magnetic ﬁeld selected for this ﬁrst case, the
magnetospheric radius is smaller than the accretion radius for
most of the time and thus the magnetic gate is almost always
open (i.e. no inhibition of accretion occur due to the magnetic
barrier). The only exceptions occur when there is an abrupt in-
crease in the velocity of the wind not accompanied by a too
large drop in the density (see, e.g., t=10 h, 17 h, 19 h, 22 h,
25 h, 30 h, 37 h). This leads to RM1 ≫ Ra and thus to the clo-
sure of the magnetic barrier (note that Ra is inversely propor-
tional to the wind velocity while RM1 is inversely proportional

E. Bozzo et al.: Clumpy wind accretion in supergiant neutron star high mass X-ray binaries

to the wind density). The relatively short spin period of the NS
makes in all these cases the spin down luminosity given by Eq. 6
dominating over the contribution due to shocks in the vicinity
of the compact object (Eq. 5). As the spin period of the NS is
relatively small, and so is the corotation radius, the system re-
mains in the supersonic propeller regime (i.e., RM1 ≪ Ra and
RM = RM2 ≥ Rco) for a large fraction of the simulated time
interval. Only occasionally during the entire run (40 hours) the
wind density raises above the critical value ρlim and the system
switches to the accretion regime (see, e.g., t=7 h, 15 h, and 26 h).
Overall, Fig. 3 shows that even if the NS is endowed with a rel-
atively common magnetic ﬁeld strength and short spin period,
the introduction of the gating mechanisms lead to a substantial
decrease of the average luminosity compared to the simpliﬁed
Bondi-Hoyle accretion scenario (this can be seen by compar-
ing the magenta and red solid lines in the right bottom panel of
Fig. 3). Although the X-ray variability in this case is remark-
ably pronounced due to the large variations in the wind den-
sity/velocity and approaches the dynamic range typical of the
SFXTs, the simulated behavior does not closely resemble what
we observe in these latter sources. In particular, we are missing
the presence of the long periods of low level emission that occur
between the much less frequent outbursts and ﬂares. As noticed
already also by Oskinova et al. (2012a), the observed variability
is also much larger than what we expect in classical SGXBs.

In Fig. 4 we show the case in which the NS spin period is
much longer than before (1000 s) and maintained unchanged the
value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. The main diﬀerence com-
pared to the results presented in Fig. 3 is that the corotation ra-
dius of the NS is now much larger (as it scales with P2/3
s3 , see
Eq. 3) and thus it is more diﬃcult for the system to enter the
super-Keplerian magnetic inhibition of accretion and/or the su-
personic propeller regime. As the magnetic ﬁeld of the NS is
still relatively weak (1012 G), the system can enter the magnetic
inhibition of accretion only when the largest drops in the wind
density (or increases in the wind velocity) occur, leading to a
signiﬁcant expansion of the magnetospheric radius beyond the
accretion radius (see Eq. 2 and 1). Note that also in these cases,
the magnetospheric radius remains within the corotation radius,
and the dominant contribution to the X-ray luminosity of the sys-
tem is provided by Eq. 7. For most of the time, the system is in
the direct accretion regime, achieving the high X-ray luminosity
expressed by Eq. 17. In this regime the magnetospheric radius
is smaller than both the accretion and the corotation radius, and
the condition on the critical wind density is also satisﬁed (see
Eq. 13). From Fig. 4 we note that in several occasion the system
also switches to the subsonic propeller regime because, even if
the magnetospheric radius is smaller than Rco and Ra, the wind
density happens to be lower than ρlim at certain intervals of time.
In all these cases, the dominant contribution to the system X-
ray luminosity is provided by Eq. 15 (note that the contribution
given by Eq. 16 is much lower due to the long spin period of the
NS assumed in the present case).

In Fig. 5 we increased the strength of the NS magnetic ﬁeld
up to 1014 G and kept the previous value of the spin period. As
it can be seen from this ﬁgure, the larger magnetic ﬁeld pushes
the magnetospheric radius beyond the accretion radius for a sub-
stantial amount of time (note that the time variability of the wind
density and velocity is always the same in all plots correspond-
ing to the same orbital separation). The system thus spends a
signiﬁcant amount of time in the super-Keplerian magnetic in-
hibition of accretion, where the most relevant contributions to
the X-ray luminosity are given by Eq. 5 and 6. Note that, at
odds with the case of Fig. 3, the signiﬁcantly longer spin pe-

riod and stronger magnetic ﬁeld of the NS make the contribution
of the luminosity released at the shock in front of the compact
object comparable to the spin down luminosity in this regime
(Eq. 6). The upper panels of Fig. 5 also show that in this case
the magnetospheric radius and the accretion radius are relatively
close one to the other. As a consequence, minor increases in
the wind density or drops in the wind velocity cause a switch
from the super-Keplerian magnetic inhibition regime to the su-
personic propeller regime and the subsonic propeller regime,
where RM ≪ Ra. A transition to the direct accretion regime is
also observed corresponding to the largest increases in the wind
density (the range spanned by the wind velocity is much more
reduced compared to that of the density in the clumpy wind
model considered here). These transitions occur, for example,
around t = 6, 13, 15, 22, 26, 28, 35 h. Compared to the previous
two cases, it is clear that a larger magnetic ﬁeld and a longer
spin period make the more extreme accretion regimes achiev-
able for longer amount of times. The average X-ray luminosity
of the system is thus dramatically decreased compared to the
value expected from the simple Bondi-Hoyle accretion and we
approach a variability behavior that is more reminiscent of that
of the SFXTs, with extended low emission periods separating
the much brighter and sporadic outbursts.

4.2. Orbitalperiod25.6days

In this section we present similar results as those in Sect. 4.1, but
in the case of a larger orbital separation between the NS and the
supergiant companion. In Fig. 6, 7, and 8, we show the results
of the previous calculations reported in Fig. 3,4, 5 extended to
the longer orbital period case. As it can be seen comparing each
couple of ﬁgures, the qualitative discussion presented for the dif-
ferent magnetic ﬁeld and spin period cases of Sec. 4.1 still holds
and the system in the diﬀerent conﬁgurations experience similar
accretion regimes.

The main diﬀerence compared to the shorter orbital period
case is that at larger distances from the supergiant companion,
the variations in the density and velocity of the clumpy wind are
much shallower. This leads to a substantially less pronounced
variability, with X-ray outbursts becoming less and less frequent
and low level activity intervals more and more prolonged in time.
It is particularly interesting to note that the X-ray variability
observed in the case with the higher magnetic ﬁeld and longer
spin period (µ33 = 0.1 and Ps3 = 1, see Fig. 8) is still the one
that more closely resemble the behavior typical of SFXTs, with
fewer and fewer prominent outbursts arising during periods of
longer and longer low level X-ray emission.

5. Discussion and conclusions

In this paper we presented a ﬁrst attempt to take into account
the eﬀects of the magnetic and centrifugal gating mechanisms
during the accretion of a highly structured stellar wind onto a NS
hosted in a SGXB. We showed that the magnetic ﬁeld properties
and the spin period of the compact object dramatically impact
the X-ray luminosity released by the system.

The non-stationary wind model we adopted in this work is
well known to provide reasonably good predictions for the X-ray
observed from massive stars. Although the density and velocity
variations derived from this model might need to be revised in
the future when 2D/3D models will be available (see Sect. 1), the
coupling of these variations with all the gating accretion regimes
proposed originally by B08, allowed us to investigate how the
transitions between these regimes can be triggered in the clumpy

E. Bozzo et al.: Clumpy wind accretion in supergiant neutron star high mass X-ray binaries

environment of a wind-fed SGXB. We have also been able to
study which X-ray luminosity and variability pattern can be ex-
pected as a function of the NS spin period, magnetic ﬁeld, and
orbital period. Based on all the cases analyzed in Sect. 4, we ﬁrst
highlighted the fact that the introduction of the gating mecha-
nisms led to a substantial reduction of the average system X-ray
emission compared to that computed from a simpliﬁed Bondi-
Hoyle accretion scenario, even in those cases in which modest
magnetic ﬁeld values (∼ 1012 G) and short spin periods (∼10 s)
are assumed for the compact object. This suggests that calcula-
tions of the X-ray luminosity released by NS wind-fed binaries
in which the eﬀect of the gating mechanisms is not taken into
account could be signiﬁcantly overestimated.

We also found that the combination of a longer spin period
and a higher magnetic ﬁeld might more easily lead to an SFXT-
like behavior, i.e. with sporadic bright outbursts emerging dur-
ing periods of a much fainter X-ray emission (as previously dis-
cussed by B08). It is also worth noticing that the reduction of the
mass accretion rate onto the compact object strongly increases
with the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld, thus strengthening the
idea that highly magnetized NSs can be hosted in SFXTs, as
the inhibition of accretion has been convincingly identiﬁed as
a key ingredient to explain the sub-luminosity of all sources in
this class compared to classical SGXBs (Lutovinov et al. 2013;
Bozzo et al. 2015). Note also that the similarity observed in the
transitions between diﬀerent accretion regimes for systems with
smaller or larger orbital periods in Sect. 4.1 and 4.2 is in agree-
ment with the observational evidence that SFXTs with orbital
separations spanning from a few to several days display re-
markably similar behaviors in the X-ray domain (Romano et al.
2014a; Sidoli et al. 2016).

In general, it is diﬃcult to reproduce the behavior of clas-
sical SGXBs within the assumption of a NS accreting from the
extremely clumpy wind in Sect. 2. The large density and veloc-
ity variations produced by the adopted clumpy wind model lead
in all cases to a more pronounced variability than that observed
from these systems. However, it was highlighted in Sect. 4 how
placing the NS at a larger distance from the supergiant compan-
ion helps in improving the similarity between simulations and
the observed behaviors of both classical SGXBs and SFXTs,
as in these cases the stellar wind is characterized by smoother
density and velocity contrasts. It is thus likely that, with future
multi-dimensional stellar wind models featuring less extreme
clump properties, the gating accretion scenario can be used to
explain the diﬀerence between classical SGXBs and SFXTs by
ﬁne-tuning only the NS parameters.

It has to be remarked here that, beside the limitations of
the 1D clumpy wind model, the present simulations are also
aﬀected by a number of additional simpliﬁcations. In particu-
lar, the NS is placed in all cases at a certain distance from the
supergiant and neither its gravitational ﬁeld nor the X-rays re-
leased as a consequence of the accretion are producing any feed-
back onto the stellar wind. We know from hydrodynamics sim-
ulations of wind-fed systems that the gravitational ﬁeld of the
compact object can largely distort the accretion ﬂow and pro-
duce signiﬁcant density and velocity variations close to the com-
pact object. The latter can thus enhance the X-ray variability
already produced by the presence of the clumps and the eﬀect
of the gating mechanisms (Blondin et al. 1991; Blondin 1994;
Manousakis & Walter 2015). The photoionization of the stellar
wind by the X-rays emitted from the accreting NS can also pro-
duce signiﬁcant variations in the physical properties of the wind,
including its composition and velocity. The most recent investi-
gations in these respects have been presented by Krtiˇcka et al.

(2012) and Krtiˇcka et al. (2015). These authors have shown that
the supergiant wind velocity can signiﬁcantly drop close to the
compact object or also be completely halted by the X-ray irra-
diation if the photoionization inhibits the radiative acceleration
down to the surface of the supergiant star. As the accretion radius
and the magnetospheric radius are highly sensible to variations
in the wind velocity (see Eq. 1, 2, 10, and 12), we expect that the
switches between diﬀerent accretion regime can also be aﬀected
by the photoionization. However, calculating the reciprocal feed-
back between photoionization eﬀects and gating accretion mech-
anisms in the case of a strongly in-homogeneous stellar wind
would require the development of an extremely challenging full
3D magneto-hydrodynamical treatment of the problem. This has
not been possible so far. As the X-ray irradiation of the stellar
wind depends on the orbital separation of the system, it is clear
that our simpliﬁed treatment of the problem would get less and
less accurate for shorter orbital period systems or for binaries
with large eccentricities. For this reason we did not consider the
case of orbital periods shorter than ∼9 days. We also note that
short orbital period systems (.3-5 days) at X-ray luminosities of
.1036−37 erg s−1 could also develop temporary accretion disks
(see, e.g., Ducci et al. 2010, and refeences therein), which ef-
fect onto the accretion process cannot be taken into account in
the present version of our computations. We plan to include all
these complications in future improved versions of the simula-
tions presented here.

Appendix A: The Bondi-Hoyle accretion

In the Bondi-Hoyle accretion scenario adopted previously by
Oskinova et al. (2012b), the authors followed the simpliﬁed
treatment proposed by Davidson & Ostriker (1973) in which a
NS is traveling with a relative speed vrel through a gas with den-
sity ρ. The mass accretion rate is given in this case by

˙Macc = πζR2

avrelρw

(A.1)

where the quantities Ra, vrel, and ρw are the same as those in-
troduced in Sect. 3. The factor ζ ∼ 1 is included to take into
account numerical corrections due to the radiation pressure and
the ﬁnite cooling time of the gas. Combining Eq. A.1 and 1, it
can be obtained

˙Macc = 4πζ

(GMNS)2

v3

ρw.

(A.2)

In these equations, ρw is assumed to be the time dependent den-
sity of the wind provided by the clumpy wind code described in
Sect. 2. Oskinova et al. (2012b) did not neglect the NS orbital
velocity compared to the wind velocity, and thus

v2
rel = v2

X + v2
w,

where the orbital velocity of the NS, vX, is given by

(A.3)

(A.4)

The X-ray luminosity of an accreting neutron star in this simpli-
ﬁed scenario can thus be expressed as

Lacc = η ˙Maccrc2,

(A.5)

where c is the speed of light and η ∼ 0.1 is a numerical constant
introduced to take into account unknown geometrical aspects of
the accretion process. The value computed through Eq. A.5 is
reported in all bottom panels of Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 with a
solid magenta line.
