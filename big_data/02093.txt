Introduction

In what follows, K denotes a ﬁeld, P the polynomial algebra K[Xv | v ∈ V ], V := {1, . . . , n}, in n ≥ 1
commuting variables X1, . . . , Xn, and X ν will be shorthand for the monomial X ν1

1 ··· X νn
n .

One of the main objects of concern in combinatorics, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry
are algebras P/I deﬁned by an ideal I ⊆ P , or more generally, varieties and schemes associated to I.
Among the large amount of examples that appear in these areas some of the most important are the
following.
(1) The coordinate ring K[V] = P/IV of an aﬃne (or projective) variety V ⊆ An(K) (⊆ Pn−1(K)),

where IV = {F ∈ P (homogeneous)| F (v) = 0 for all v ∈ V}.

(2) The Stanley-Reisner algebra K[∆] := P/I∆ associated to a simplicial complex ∆ on V , where

I∆ = (Qv∈F Xv | F 6∈ ∆) is the so-called Stanley-Reisner ideal of ∆.

(3) The toric ring K[C] ⊆ K[Y1, . . . , Yr] of a ﬁnite set of monomials C = {Y ν1 , . . . , Y νn} ⊆
K[Y1, . . . , Yr], which is given by P/IC via π : P → K[C], Xi 7→ Y νi , where IC = ker π is
the so-called toric ideal associated to C.

As a non-commutative example, we give the following from representation theory.

(4) The path algebra K[Q] = P/ID associated to a quiver Q := (V, A), where D is the set of paths
in Q and ID = (X p | p 6∈ D) is the so-called path ideal of Q, where P denotes in this case the
polynomial algebra with non-commuting variables Xv, v ∈ V .

The algebras K[∆] and K[Q] are related to combinatorial objects, namely ∆ and Q, and so is K[C]
since it is naturally isomorphic to the monoid algebra KM of the aﬃne monoid M = Nν1 + ··· + Nνn
generated by ν1, . . . , νn ∈ Nr. While K[∆] and K[Q] are monomial algebras (i.e. deﬁned by an ideal
generated by monomials), the deﬁning ideal IC of K[C] is a graded prime ideal generated by ﬁnitely
many pure diﬀerence binomials ([56, Proposition 7.1.2]), which are polynomials of the form X ν − X µ.
In fact, every monoid algebra is the homomorphic image of a polynomial algebra K[Xv | v ∈ W ] for a
not necessarily ﬁnite set W by an ideal I generated by pure diﬀerence binomials ([28, Theorem 7.11]).
This also shows that certain varieties are related to combinatorial objects, for instance, toric varieties
([20],[27]).

From a conceptual point of view it seems desirable to have a theory that treats those algebras (or
varieties or schemes) related to combinatorial objects within the same framework. Toric face rings
are one attempt. Introduced by Stanley ([54]), they unify Stanley-Reisner algebras and aﬃne monoid
algebras by mimicking the connection of a monoid to its algebra with a modiﬁed operation described
below (⋆). The construction of Stanley has been generalized to monoideal complexes ([34], [11, Chapter
7.B]) and has proven to be relevant to such a uniﬁcation.
Another very powerful framework is the theory of binomial ideals. A binomial is a polynomial of the
form aX ν − bX µ with a, b ∈ K, and an ideal generated by binomials is a binomial ideal. By deﬁnition,
a pure diﬀerence binomial is a binomial with a = b = 1, and a monomial is a binomial with a = 1 and
b = 0. In particular, every Stanley-Reisner algebra and monoid algebra can be realized as an algebra
deﬁned by a binomial ideal. Algebras, varieties, and schemes related to a binomial ideal constitute
an immense quantity of classical and important examples in combinatorics, commuatitve algebra, and

2

algebraic geometry, which justiﬁes the strong interest as well as the large body of literature and active
work on binomial ideals ([11], [24], [33], [41], [56], [35]). Moreover, they have notable applications
beyond pure mathematics like coding theory, algebraic statistics, game theory, linear programming,
and chemical kinetics ([55], [40], and the references therein). Due to their combinatorial nature, a lot
of algorithms and feasible computations are possible, which makes them even more attractive.

However, the somewhat smaller class of binomial ideals generated merely by pure diﬀerence binomials
and/or monomials (i.e. by binomials with coeﬃcients a, b ∈ {0, 1}), which are independent of the base
ﬁeld (or ring), still cover a great part of the signiﬁcant cases (e.g. toric face rings). This class outlines
precisely the scope of this thesis. The main reason for restricting ourselves exactly to this class is
that it is the largest class within which the powerful interplay of monoids and their algebras can be
extended in a rather simple way.

Deﬁnition. Let M be an additively written monoid. An absorbing element a ∈ M satisﬁes a + b = a
for all b ∈ M . Such an element is always unique and will be denoted by ∞ if it exists. A monoid
with an absorbing element is called a binoid. Its associated algebra, called the binoid algebra of M , is
deﬁned to be the quotient algebra

K[M ] := KM/(X ∞) .

By deﬁnition, every binoid is a monoid. On the other hand, adjoining an absorbing element to
an arbitrary monoid M subject to its deﬁning property yields a binoid M ∪ {∞} =: M ∞ such
that K[M ∞] = KM . Thus, binoid algebras generalize monoid algebras. They are precisely the
homomorphic images of polynomial algebras by ideals generated by pure diﬀerence binomials and/or
monomials. Since adjoining an absorbing element has no impact on the structure of a monoid there
is no loss of generality when turning from a monoid to a binoid.
As a matter of fact, dealing with binoids is more natural for several reasons. As in ring theory, one
of the most fundamental tools in monoid theory is the Rees quotient

M/I = {[a] | a ∈ M \ I} ∪ {[I]} ∼= M \ I ∪ {[I]}

of a monoid M by an ideal I ⊆ M with addition given by

[a] + [b] = ([a + b]

[I]

, if a + b 6∈ I ,
, otherwise.

On the one hand, the class [I] is an absorbing element in M/I, which shows that one inevitably
encounters binoids even when dealing solely with monoids that admit no absorbing element in ﬁrst
place. On the other hand, considering M ∞ yields a canonical representative for the class [I], namely
[I] = [∞], because it reﬂects its characteristic feature of being absorbing. By proceeding in this way,
one obtains an elegant description of M ∞/I, which is also appreciated in monoid theory but has to
be enforced by the standard practice of deﬁning [I] =: ∞ ([30, Chapter 1.3]).

Considering binoids accomplishes more than just focussing on a particular class of monoids that
appear naturally in many situations, and yielding better notation when the absorbing element is
emphasized. The main motivation for binoid theory was the observation that many algebras that
arise in combinatorics can be realized as binoid algebras but not as monoid algebras, because of zero-
divisors that can be encoded on the combinatorial level with binoids but not with monoids.
Let us outline how such algebras are typically constructed: given a collection C of objects with a
partial operation, that is, to some pairs c1, c2 ∈ C there exists a unique object in C, say c1 ∗ c2, and
whenever c1 ∗ c2 and c2 ∗ c3 are deﬁned for c1, c2, c3 ∈ C, then (c1 ∗ c2) ∗ c3 is deﬁned if and only if
c1 ∗ (c2 ∗ c3) is as well, and in this case they coincide. The algebra associated to C is now deﬁned to

Introduction

be the K - module

with multiplication deﬁned by

K[C] := Mc∈C

KX c

X c1 · X c2 := (X c1∗c2

0

, if c1 ∗ c2 is deﬁned,
, otherwise.

3

(⋆)

Obviously, if the partial operation is no operation, this algebra is not an integral domain and cannot
be realized as a monoid algebra. However, it is straightforward to see that C deﬁnes a binoid, namely
C ∪ {∞} =: MC with addition given by

c1 + c2 := (c1 ∗ c2

∞

, if this is deﬁned,

, otherwise,

and that K[MC] = K[C]; that is, K[C] is a binoid algebra. Hence, shifting the deﬁning operation from
the module to the combinatorial level creates a situation similar to the correspondence of monoids to
their algebras. This is to say, with a theory of binoids and their algebras at hand, the strucure of
K[C] could be revealed by the combinatorics of MC and vice versa.
The advantages of such a theory are obvious. Like toric face rings, binoid algebras unify diﬀerent
algebras that arise in combinatorial commutative algebra by studying them within the same frame-
work. This is a very powerful and comprehensive framework since binoids being monoids allow us to
adapt the well-established and elaborate theory of monoids and their algebras, given for instance in
[15], [28], [29], [30], [38] or [46] to mention just a very few (of which some also deal with binoids and
their algebras like the books [15] from the 1960s).
Of course, considering the absorbing element causes new properties to arise, known concepts need
to be modiﬁed, and pathologies appear compared to common structures in (commutative) algebra.
However, for several reasons and motivations, working with binoids rather than arbitrary monoids
seems preferable in certain situations, as can be veriﬁed by the frequency with which they appear in
the literature and their profound applications in diﬀerent branches of algebra and geometry ([3], [15],
[30], [37], [39], [43], [44], [46]). There, they are usually written multiplicatively and called “monoid
with zero” or “pointed monoid”, while the binoid algebra is also known as a “contracted” or “pointed
monoid algebra”. For instance, spaces with a monoidal structure became increasingly important due
to their appearance in F1 - geometry and logarithmic algebraic geometry within the last two decades.
Study in both areas depends largely on the commutative algebra of monoids and consequently enriches
monoid theory by developing a geometric theory of monoids including sheaves of monoids and monoid
schemes ([45], [21], [22]), with which we will not be concerned. Even there, some approaches favor
working with binoids from scratch for a more general theory ([14], [16], [17], [18], [19], [26]).
Thus, binoids appear in many diﬀerent branches of mathematics but, unfortunately, it seems that one
is not always aware of what has already been done elsewhere. This is most likely due to terminology,
since in older works on binoids, they are simply addressed as semigroups.

We also want to bring two more works on binoids to the attention of the reader. In [6], Hilbert-Kunz
theory for binoids is developed. It is shown that for certain binoids the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity exists
and is a rational number. A geometrical approach to binoids can be found in [1], where invariants of a
binoid scheme are related to those of the corresponding ring. The main focus of this work are divisor
class groups and Picard groups of binoid schemes.

It is one aim of this thesis to provide a general theory of binoids, their algebras, and their spectra,
but we will not pay as much attention to the algebras (and modules) as to the binoids and spectra.

4

The core of this thesis is rather based on the familiar idea in commutative algebra to go one step
further and have a view on algebraic geometry by means of the seminal relation between commutative
algebras and geometric spaces. In Chapter 4 and 5, we show that the space of K - points of a binoid
algebra can be studied and fully understood from the combinatorics provided by the underlying binoid
by making use of the crucial isomorphism

K- spec K[M ] ∼= K- spec M ,

where K- spec M is the set of all K - valued morphisms of M . In this regard, we investigate several
connectedness properties of such spaces.
In the last chapter, we apply binoid theory to simplicial
complexes, determine those binoids that realize Stanley-Reisner algebras, and show how a theory of
these objects could start from a binoid point of view.

This thesis contains six chapters, which we will sketch now. The ﬁrst two chapters cover binoid theory
including the ideal theory of binoids to which we return later when we investigate the spectrum of a
binoid from a topological point of view. Within the scope of this thesis, it was not possible to give a
full account of the whole of binoid theory developed so far and elsewhere. We try to compensate this
by giving references but do not claim completeness.
More precisely, Chapter 1 is a collection of basic deﬁnitions and constructions for binoids. Here,
terminology and mainly additive notation are taken from monoid theory. The main deﬁnitions and
properties of binoids are given before we focus on N - spectra of binoids, where N is another binoid. In
view of our main concern, the N - spectra are determined for every construction dicussed in this chap-
ter. After recalling the well-known concept of congruences for a binoid, we collect speciﬁc congruences
of interest for us. We prove that the product, coproduct, and limits exist in the category of (commu-
tative) binoids, and describe these in detail. For binoids (resp. pointed sets), one can also deﬁne the
pointed and bipointed union, where the latter applies only to binoids with a trivial unit group. The
module and algebra counterparts in binoid theory are described by pointed sets and binoids over a
binoid. We close this chapter with considerations on localization and integrality properties including
the normalization of a binoid. Though we are mainly interested in ﬁnitely generated commutative
binoids and devote one section to them, the ﬁrst chapter is kept as general as possible, whereas in the
remainder, we deal almost exclusively with commutative binoids.
In Chapter 2, we investigate the ideal theory of commutative binoids with focus on the spectrum of
a binoid, which corresponds one-to-one to its {0,∞} - spectrum and to its ﬁltrum, which is the set
of all ﬁlters. The spectra of several binoid constructions are determined by taking advantage of our
knowledge of their N - spectra. The ideal theory of binoids is very similar to that of rings with the
exception that the union of (prime) ideals in a binoid is again a (prime) ideal. Moreover, every binoid
can be considered to be local in the sense that there is a unique maximal ideal with respect to set
inclusion.
In Chapter 3, we move on to modules and algebras associated to binoids, N - sets, and N - binoids.
After recalling useful results on monoid algebras, we introduce binoid algebras, state basic facts about
them, and investigate the relationship between their ideals and the ideals of the underlying binoid.
Modules and (binoid) algebras over binoid algebras generalize the concept of binoid algebras and will
be treated at the end of this chapter.
In Chapter 4, we take a topological approach to commutative binoids via their spectra and K - spectra,
where K denotes a ﬁeld. The spectrum of a binoid can be endowed with the Zariski topology in the
same manner as that of a ring and the theories are very similar. This also applies to the dimension
theory of binoids, which we treat in the third section. We introduce the booleanization of a binoid,
whose spectrum is homeomorphic to that of the initial binoid, but which is a fairly easier binoid to
study. The topology on the K - spectrum of a binoid comes from that on the K - spectrum of the
binoid algebra K[M ]. We prove some basic facts before we investigate connectedness properties of

Introduction

5

the K - spectrum of K[M ] that can be analyzed solely on the combinatorial level. Here, we focus in
particular on the case of hypersurfaces.
In Chapter 5, we study a stronger connectedness property which involves the (special) K - point that
is related to the unique maximal ideal in the binoid. We give necessary and suﬃcient conditions under
which the special point is contained in every cancellative component of the K - spectrum, and under
which every K - point is An - connected to the special point. To obtain these results, we develop the
notion of separated and graded binoids.
In Chapter 6, simplicial complexes and Stanley-Reisner algebras are studied from a binoid theoretic
point of view. After recalling basic facts on simplicial complexes, we consider two binoids deﬁned by
a simplicial complex (with respect to ∪ and ∩). The ﬁrst three sections deal with the basic properties
of these binoids, their spectra, and morphisms between them. For a binoid N , the N - points of a
simplicial complex ∆ are introduced. These correspond one-to-one to the N - points of the binoid M∆
associated to ∆, which is the main concern of the last section. We prove that the binoid algebra of
M∆ is given by the Stanley-Reisner algebra and characterize those binoids that realize Stanley-Reisner
algebras.

Conventions

Throughout this thesis we make the following agreements. The sum over the empty set is 0, and the
product over the emptyset is 1. By a ring, we always mean a commutative ring with identity and all
ring homomorphisms preserve the identity.

1 Basic concepts of binoids

In this chapter, the basic terminology and notation concerning monoids with an absorbing element,
which we call binoids, will be introduced. All deﬁnitions come along with examples which will fre-
quently appear in the following chapters.
In the remainder of this thesis, we will mainly focus on the class of commutative binoids, but in this
chapter we try to keep it as general as possible and consider arbitrary binoids if not otherwise stated.
At the beginning of those sections that deal only with commutative binoids, we will mention this
restriction. From the beginning, we ﬁx additive notation for arbitrary binoids, though the terminology
and notation of classical concepts will not always follow this convention.

On the one hand, every binoid is a monoid so that the concepts from monoid theory apply to binoids
if the special element ∞ (and its inherent property of being a universal absorbing element) has no
eﬀect. In this case, deﬁnitions and results of semigroup and monoid theory may be transfered directly
to (semi-) binoids, otherwise we will point out the necessity to adapt well-known concepts by making
it compatible with ∞. For the sake of completeness, deﬁnitions and results are given. Standard
references for semigroup and monoid theory are the books [15] by A.H. Cliﬀord and G.B Preston,
as well as [29] and [30] by P.A. Grillet, and [28] by R. Gilmer, where the latter two focus on the
commutative case.
On the other hand, every binoid can also be considered as a pointed set, where the distinguished
point is given by the absorbing element. This concept yields very interesting and useful constructions
for binoids, cf. Section 1.8 and Section 1.10.

1.1 Basic objects

In this section, we give the deﬁnitions of the main objects of this thesis, namley binoids and their
algebras. We say how to consider a binoid as a pointed set and thereby deﬁne the product and the
direct sum of a family of binoids in the same way as for pointed sets.

Deﬁnition 1.1.1. A s e m i g r o u p (M,∗) is a set M with an associative operation

∗ : M × M −→ M ,

(a, b) 7−→ a ∗ b .

A m o n o i d (M,∗, e) is a semigroup that admits an element e which satisﬁes a ∗ e = e ∗ a = a for
all a ∈ M . Such an element is always unique and will be called the i d e n t i t y element of M . An
identity element is always unique. A s u b m o n o i d of a monoid M is a subsemigroup that contains
the identity element of M . In additive notation, the identity element will be denoted by 0 and in
multiplicative notation by 1.
An element a ∈ M in a semigroup is a b s o r b i n g if a ∗ x = x ∗ a = a for all x ∈ M . An
absorbing element is always unique. A b i n o i d (M,∗, e, a) (resp. s e m i b i n o i d (M,∗, a)) is a monoid
(resp. semigroup) with an absorbing element. A s u b b i n o i d (resp. s u b s e m i b i n o i d ) of M is a
submonoid (resp. subsemigroup) of M that contains the absorbing element of M . In additive notation,
the absorbing element will be denoted by ∞ and in multiplicative notation by 0.
By deﬁnition, semibinoids and monoids are never empty and, in particular, so are binoids.

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Convention. In this thesis, arbitrary binoids will be written additively if not otherwise stated (even
if the binoid is not commutative).

By abuse of notation, we will not strictly use additive notation when referring to classical concepts
such as localization and so forth. Moreover, unless there is confusion, we abbreviate

na := a + ··· + a and nA := {a1 + ··· + an | ai ∈ A}

for n ∈ N, a ∈ M , and A ⊆ M , where 0a := 0 and 0A := ∅.1
While we are studying binoids, we always have their associated algebras in mind and will refer to
them. Then we tacitly assume little knowledge about monoid algebras since the b i n o i d a l g e b r a
is given by

R[M ] := RM/(T ∞) ,

where M is a binoid, R a ring, RM =La∈M RT a the monoid algebra, and (T ∞) the ideal in RM

generated by T ∞. An elaboration of the basics of monoid and binoid algebras will be given in Section
3.1 and Section 3.2.

Example 1.1.2. Let R be a ring.
(1) The binoid algebra of the z e r o b i n o i d {∞}, i.e. 0 = ∞, over any ring is the zero ring.
(2) The binoid algebra of the t r i v i a l b i n o i d {0,∞}, i.e. with 0 6= ∞, over R is R.
(3) Adjoining an absorbing element ∞ to the commutative monoid (Nn, +, (0, . . . , 0)), n ≥ 1, yields
a binoid, denoted by (Nn)∞, by deﬁning k + ∞ =: ∞ (this construction is based on a gen-
eral concept which will be discussed subsequently). The binoid algebra R[(Nn)∞] = R(Nn) is
isomorphic to the polynomial algebra R[X1, . . . , Xn] in n variables.

(4) Every ring yields a (commutative) binoid by forgetting the additive structure.

The binoids of the following example play an important role in this thesis and will frequently appear.

Example 1.1.3. Let V be an arbitrary set. The power set P(V ) gives rise to two diﬀerent commutative
binoids, namely

P(V )∩ := (P(V ),∩, V,∅) and P(V )∪ := (P(V ),∪,∅, V ) .

In either case, P(∅) yields the zero binoid and P({1}) the trivial binoid. If V is ﬁnite, we abbreviate
P({1, , . . . , n}) =: Pn and write Pn,∩ and Pn,∪ for the corresponding binoids, n ≥ 1.
The subbinoids of P(V )∩ and P(V )∪ are given by the subsets M ⊆ P(V ) that are closed with respect
to the operation of ∪ and ∩, respectively, and contain ∅ and V . If M is a subbinoid of P(V )∪ (resp.
P(V )∩), then

M c := {U c | U ∈ M} ,

where U c := V \ U denotes the complement of U , is a subbinoid of P(V )∩ (resp. P(V )∪) since
U c ∪ W c = (U ∩ W )c (resp. U c ∩ W c = (U ∪ W )c) for all U, W ⊆ P(V ).
In particular, every topology T = {U | U ⊆ V open} on a nonempty set V deﬁnes commutative
binoids with respect to the join and meet operation, namely (T ,∩, V,∅) = T∩ and (T ,∪,∅, V ) = T∪,
as well as the set of all closed sets T c = {U c | U ∈ T }. The binoids P(V )∪ and P(V )∩ come from
the discrete topology on V , and the binoid due to the trivial topology on V is nothing else than the
trivial binoid {V,∅}.
By deﬁnition, every semibinoid is a semigroup and every binoid is a monoid. On the other hand, it
is always possible to adjoin an identity or an absorbing element subject to their deﬁning conditions

1 The latter deﬁnitions are consistent with our convention that the sum over the empty set is 0.

1.1 Basic objects

11

even if such an element already exists. For instance, if (M, +, 0,∞) is a binoid, then M ∪ {0} subject
to a + 0 = 0 + a = a for all a ∈ M , in particular,

0 + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 ,

is a binoid with identity element 0. Thus, every semigroup (or monoid or semibinoid) is embeddable
in a binoid so that considering binoids amounts to no loss of generality.

Deﬁnition 1.1.4. The semibinoid and monoid that arises from adjoining an absorbing and an identity
element to a semigroup M will be denoted by M ∞ and M 0, respectively. If M possesses an absorbing
element ∞, we write M • for the set M \ {∞}.
Objects like monoids and semibinoids originate from a more general concept.

Deﬁnition 1.1.5. A p o i n t e d s e t (S, p) is a set S with a distinguished element p ∈ S and a map
(S, p) → (T, q) of pointed sets with p 7→ q is called a p o i n t e d m a p . The set of all pointed maps
S → T will be denoted by mapp7→q(S, T ). In case T = S, we simply write mapp S.
The set mapp S is a binoid with respect to the composition of maps S → S. The identity element is
given by idS and the absorbing element by the constant map cp : s 7→ p, s ∈ S. In the next section,
cf. Lemma 1.2.6, we will show that every binoid can be realized as the subbinoid of such a mapping
binoid

(mapp S,◦, idS, cp) .

Note that there are no conditions required from the distinguished point unless it comes to morphisms
of pointed sets. Thus, a set M is a monoid if and only if it is a pointed semigroup (M, 0) with
the additional property of the identity element 0. Similarly, a semibinoid M is a pointed semigroup
(M,∞) subject to the deﬁning property of ∞. Having observed this, a binoid M can be considered
as a pointed set (M, p) in two diﬀerent ways: as a pointed set with p = 0 or as a pointed set with
p = ∞. It turns out that the latter approach is the one that makes more sense in our context, see for
instance the deﬁnition of the product below or Section 1.8 and Section 1.10.

Since binoids are monoids, the product and the direct sum of a family of binoids is well-deﬁned. It
remains the question if the outcome has a binoid structure as well. For the sake of completeness, we
recall the deﬁnitions for pointed sets and state the main results about monoids (without giving proofs)
before we consider binoids.

Deﬁnition 1.1.6. The p r o d u c t of an arbitrary family (Si, pi)i∈I of pointed sets is given by the

The product and the direct sum of a family (Si, pi)i∈I of pointed sets are again pointed sets with
distinguished element (pi)i∈I and they coincide if and only if I is ﬁnite; in this case, we prefer the

cartesian productQi∈I Si. The subset consisting of all tuples (si)i∈I with si = pi for almost all i ∈ I
is called the d i r e c t s u m and will be denoted byLi∈I Si.
notationQi∈I Si instead ofLi∈I Si. Considering a monoid as a pointed set with distinguished element
Lemma 1.1.7. Let (Mi, +, 0i)i∈I be a family of monoids. The productQi∈I (Mi)i∈I is a monoid with
sumLi∈I Mi, which consists of all tuples (ai)i∈I with ai = 0i for almost all i ∈ I, is a submonoid of
Qi∈I Mi.

the componentwise addition (ai)i∈I + (bi)i∈I = (ai + bi)i∈I and identity element (0i)i∈I . The direct

0, we get the following result.

Proof. This is easy to check.

Proposition 1.1.8. The product in the category of monoids is given by the product monoid; that
is, if (Mi)i∈I is a family of monoids such that for every i ∈ I there is a monoid homomorphism

12

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proof. This is standard.

qi : Q → Mi, then there exists a unique monoid homomorphism q : Q →Qi∈I Mi with πkq = qk for
all k ∈ I, where πk denotes the canonical projectionQi∈I Mi → Mk on the kth component.
One can also consider the subset of the productQi∈I Mi of a family (Mi)i∈I of binoids that contains
all tuples (ai)i∈I with ai = 0i for almost all i ∈ I. Clearly, this is a subsemigroup ofQi∈I Mi.

However, the next result gives reason for our convention to consider a binoid as a pointed set with
distinguished element ∞ because, similar to rings, the direct sum of an inﬁnite family (Mi,∞i)i∈I of
nonzero binoids as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.1.6 is only a semibinoid.

Corollary 1.1.9. Let (Mi)i∈I be a family of binoids. With respect to the componentwise addition, the

with the product if and only if Mi = {∞i} for almost all i ∈ I.
Proof. This is similar to Lemma 1.1.7.

productQi∈I Mi of the family (Mi,∞i)i∈I of pointed sets is a binoid with identity element (0i)i∈I =:
0Π and absorbing element (∞i)i∈I =: ∞Π. The direct sum Li∈I Mi is a semibinoid that coincides
Lemma 1.1.10. The productQi∈I Mi of a family (Mi)i∈I of nonzero binoids is commutative if and

only if all Mi are commutative.

Proof. This is easily veriﬁed.

1.2 Homomorphisms

Deﬁnition 1.2.1. Let M and N be binoids (or semibinoids). A map ϕ : M → N is a ( s e m i -)
b i n o i d h o m o m o r p h i s m if it is a monoid (resp. semigroup) homomorphism which sends ∞M to
∞N . Moreover, we call ϕ a m o n o m o r p h i s m or e m b e d d i n g if its is injective, an e p i m o r p h i s m
if it is surjective, and an i s o m o r p h i s m if it is bijective. The set im ϕ := ϕ(M ) is the i m a g e of ϕ,
and the set

ker ϕ := {a ∈ M | ϕ(a) = ∞N}

is the k e r n e l of ϕ. The set of all binoid homomorphisms from M to N is denoted by hom(M, N ).

Remark 1.2.2. A binoid homomorphism that satisﬁes ker = {∞} need not be injective. For example,
the binoid homomorphism ϕ : N∞ → {0,∞} with x 7→ 0 if x 6= ∞ and ∞ otherwise, fulﬁlls ker ϕ =
{∞}, but is not injective.
Example 1.2.3. Let M be a binoid.

(1) There are canonical binoid homomorphisms

{0,∞} −→ M −→ {∞} .

(2) If M is commutative, the map M → M with a → ka is a binoid homomorphism for every k ∈ N.
(3) Every element a ∈ M deﬁnes a binoid homomorphism ϕa : N∞ → M with 1 7→ a. Conversely,
every binoid homomorphism N∞ → M is determined by the image of 1. Hence, hom(N∞, M ) ∼=
M . The image im ϕa is given by the subbinoid {∞, na | n ∈ N}, and ker ϕa 6= {∞} if and only
if a is nilpotent.

(4) If the operation on M is given by ∩ or ∪, then M → M c with A 7→ Ac is in either case a
binoid isomorphism. This holds particularly for the binoid S(V ) and for the binoid deﬁned by
a topology on V , for instance, for the discrete topology P(V ) ∼= P(V )c.

1.3 Generators

13

Example 1.2.4. Let I = {1, . . . , n}, n ≥ 1.
(1) The canonical bijections Pn,∩ → {0,∞}n, A 7→ (δi(A))i∈I , and Pn,∪ → {0,∞}n, A 7→ (¯δi(A))i∈I ,

where

δi(A) = (0

, if i ∈ A ,
∞ , otherwise,

and ¯δi(A) = (∞ , if i ∈ A ,

, otherwise,

0

for i ∈ I, are binoid isomorphisms.

(2) Let (Mi)i∈I be a family of binoids and k ∈ I. The projection on the kth component

Yi∈I

Mi −→ Mk ,

(ai)i∈I 7−→ ak ,

is a binoid epimorphism, whereas the inclusion Mk ֒→Qi∈I Mi given by

a 7−→ (∞, . . . ,∞, a,∞, . . . ,∞)
is only a semibinoid homomorphism, and the inclusion given by

a 7−→ (0, . . . , 0, a, 0, . . . , 0)

is only a monoid homomorphism (in either case a is the kth component).

The category of binoids B possesses an initial object, namely the trivial binoid {0,∞}. The terminal
object of B is given by the zero binoid {∞}. Note that there is no binoid homomorphism from the
zero binoid into a nonzero binoid. The category of commutative binoids is a full subcategory of B
which we denote by comB.

Proposition 1.2.5. The product in the category of binoids B is given by the product.

Proof. This follows immediately from Proposition 1.1.8 and Corollary 1.1.9.

The (ﬁnite) coproduct of commutative binoids will be described in Section 1.8. The following state-
ment is a Cayley-type embedding theorem for binoids.

Lemma 1.2.6. Given a binoid M , there exists a binoid embedding

M −→ map∞ M ,

x 7−→ (tx : y 7→ x + y) .

Proof. This map is a binoid homomorphism because (tx ◦ tx′)(y) = x + x′ + y = tx+x′(y) for all
x, y ∈ M , 0 7→ t0 = idM , and ∞ 7→ (t∞ : y 7→ ∞). The injectivity follows from the simple fact that
tx = tx′ is equivalent to x + y = x′ + y for all y ∈ M , which implies x = x′ for y = 0.

1.3 Generators

Now we consider generators of binoids and introduce free, free commutative, and semifree binoids
as well as binoids deﬁned by generators and relations. Later, cf. Section 1.12, ﬁnitely generated
commutative binoids will be treated in more detail.

Deﬁnition 1.3.1. Let M be a binoid and A ⊂ M a subset. Since the intersection of a family of
subbinoids of M is a subbinoid, there exists a smallest subbinoid of M containing the set A which will
be called the binoid g e n e r a t e d by A and denoted by

hAi .

14

1 Basic concepts of binoids

If M = hAi, we say M is g e n e r a t e d by A and call A a g e n e r a t i n g s e t and its elements
g e n e r a t o r s of M . In this case, A is called a m i n i m a l g e n e r a t i n g s e t of M if no proper subset
of A generates M . A binoid is f i n i t e l y g e n e r a t e d if it is generated by a ﬁnite subset. A ﬁnitely
generated binoid that admits a (minimal) generating subset with n elements and all other generating
subsets consist of ≥ n elements is called n - g e n e r a t e d . A f i n i t e binoid consists of ﬁnitely many
elements only. These deﬁnitions apply to a semibinoid S and a subset A ⊆ S if they hold for the
binoid S 0 and A.

A generating set A of a binoid M generates M as a monoid if and only if there are elements a, b ∈ M •
with a + b = ∞ (this property will be called non-integral later). Otherwise, A∪{∞} generates M as a
monoid. In particular, a binoid is ﬁnitely generated if and only if it is ﬁnitely generated as a monoid.

Example 1.3.2.
(1) The zero binoid {∞} is ﬁnitely generated by ∅ as a monoid and as a binoid. The trivial binoid

{0,∞} is generated as a binoid by ∅, but its monoid generator is ∞.

(2) N∞ = h1i as a binoid but the monoid generators of N∞ are 1 and ∞. In general, (Nn)∞, n ≥ 1,

is ﬁnitely generated as a binoid by the elements

ei := (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) ,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, where 1 is the ith entry, and as a monoid by (∞, . . . ,∞) and ei, i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

(3) If (Mi)i∈I is a ﬁnite family of binoids and Ai ⊆ Mi a generating set of Mi, i ∈ I, thenQi∈I Mi

is generated by

ei,∞ := (0, . . . , 0,∞, 0, . . . , 0) and aei := (0, . . . , 0, a, 0, . . . , 0) ,

a ∈ Ai, i ∈ I, where ∞ and a are the ith component of ei,∞ and aei, respectively. For instance,
(N∞)n, n ≥ 1, is generated as a monoid and as a binoid by the elements ei and ei,∞, i ∈ I.

(4) Subbinoids of a ﬁnitely generated binoid need not be ﬁnitely generated. For instance, the
≥1)n)0 ⊆ (N∞)n and ((N≥1)n)0,∞ ⊆ (Nn)∞ are not ﬁnitely generated for n ≥ 2

subbinoids ((N∞
since every generating set has to contain the elements (n, 1, . . . , 1), n ≥ 1, for instance.

(5) Let n, m ∈ N. The operation n⋄m := lcm(n, m) on N yields a commutative binoid (N,⋄, 1, 0) that
is not ﬁnitely generated since every generating set has to contain all powers of prime numbers.
(6) If a topology T on V admits a basis B, then B generates the binoid (T ,∪, V,∅) if and only if
T is a quasi-compact topology on V ; that is, when every open covering admits a ﬁnite one. For
instance, the binoid P(V )∩ deﬁned by the discrete topology on V is ﬁnitely generated if and
only if V is ﬁnite.

Lemma 1.3.3. A commutative binoid is ﬁnite if and only if it is ﬁnitely generated and every one-
generated subbinoid is ﬁnite.

Proof. Only the if part of the statement is not trivial. Every ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid
M = hx1, . . . , xri, r ∈ N, gives rise to a canonical binoid epimorphism

rYi=1

hxii −→ M with (n1x1, . . . , nrxr) 7−→

nixi .

rXi=1

The product is ﬁnite since all its components are ﬁnite by assumption. Now the ﬁniteness of M follows
from the surjectivity.

If M is a binoid generated by the (not necessarily ﬁnite) set A, every element f ∈ M • can be written

1.3 Generators

15

as a ﬁnite sum of the generators. In case M is commutative, we have the following notation

f =Xa∈A

naa

with na ∈ N and na = 0 for almost all a ∈ A. Of course, this expression need not be unique.
Deﬁnition 1.3.4. Let V be an arbitrary set of elements. Let M (V ) denote the free monoid consisting
of all ﬁnite sums of elements in V with addition given by

(x1 + ··· + xn) + (y1 + ··· + ym) := x1 + ··· + xn + y1 + ··· + ym ,

xi, yj ∈ V , i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, j ∈ {1, . . . , m}, and the sum over the empty set (:= 0) as identity element.
The binoid M (V )∞ =: F(V ) is called the f r e e b i n o i d on V .

Lemma 1.3.5. Every element 6= ∞ of F(V ) can be written uniquely as a sum of elements of V .
Proof. This is clear since x1 + ··· + xn = (x1) + ··· + (xn).
Obviously, F(V ) is commutative if and only if V = {x} is a singleton. In a commutative binoid with
more than one generator, one cannot expect unique expression of elements.

Lemma 1.3.6. Let M be a binoid. Every subset A = {ai | i ∈ I} ⊆ M gives rise to a unique binoid
homomorphism

ε : F(I) −→ M ,

i 7−→ ai ,

i ∈ I, which is surjective if and only if A generates M .
Proof. This is easily veriﬁed.

The preceding lemma implies, in particular, that every generating set A = {ai | i ∈ I} of a binoid M
yields a canonical binoid epimorphism ε : F(I) → M with i 7→ ai, i ∈ I.
Deﬁnition 1.3.7. Let M be a commutative binoid. We say M is a f r e e c o m m u t a t i v e binoid
if there exists a binoid isomorphism ε : (N(I))∞ → M for some (possibly inﬁnite) set I. The family
(ε(ei))i∈I of elements in M is called a b a s i s of M . The free commutative binoid with basis V will
be denoted by FC(V ) or by FCn if V = {1, . . . , n}.
Lemma 1.3.8. Every element f 6= ∞ of a ﬁnitely generated free commutative binoid with basis (xi)i∈I

admits a unique expression as f =Pi∈I nixi with ni = 0 for almost all i ∈ I.

Proof. This follows from the fact that every element a ∈ (N(I))∞ has this property for I ﬁnite.
Example 1.3.9. The commutative binoid Z∞ is not free commutative because there are non-trivial
invertible elements, which yield non-unique expressions of 0 ∈ Z∞. The canonical binoid epimorphism
ϕ : (N2)∞ → Z∞ with (1, 0) 7→ 1 and (0, 1) 7→ −1 is not injective because ϕ−1(0) = {(n, n) | n ∈ Z}
for instance. See also Example 1.3.13(2).

Lemma 1.3.6 carries over to free commutative binoids.

Lemma 1.3.10. Given a family (ai)i∈I of commuting elements in a binoid M , i.e. ai + aj = aj + ai
for all i, j ∈ I, there exists a unique binoid homomorphism

i 7−→ ai ,
i ∈ I, which is surjective if and only if {ai | i ∈ I} generates M .

ε : FC(I) −→ M ,

16

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proof. All statements are easily veriﬁed.

In a commutative binoid M every set {ai | i ∈ I} of elements in M gives rise to a binoid homomor-
phism

i ∈ I, that is surjective if and only if {ai | i ∈ I} generates M . For instance,

(N(I))∞ −→ M ,

ei 7−→ ai ,

ϕ : (Nn)∞ −→ (N∞)n ,

ei 7−→ ei ,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, is not surjective because {e1, . . . , en} is only half of a generating set of (N∞)n, cf.
Example 1.3.2(3). Note that

π : (N∞)n −→ (Nn)∞ with ei 7−→ ei
i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, is an epimorphism such that πϕ = id(Nn)∞ .
Deﬁnition 1.3.11. Let V be an arbitrary set. The binoids that arise from F(V ) and FC(V ) by taking
additional relations Ri, i ∈ I, among the elements of V into account will be denoted by

and ei,∞ 7−→ ∞ ,

F(V )/(Ri)i∈I

and FC(V )/(Ri)i∈I .

Here we tacitly assume the reader to be familiar with the characterization of a monoid deﬁned by
generators and relations given in the above deﬁnition in a little sketchy way. A precise justiﬁcation of
the notation (in the commutative case) can be found in Example 1.6.7.

Deﬁnition 1.3.12. Let M be a nonzero commutative binoid. We say M is a s e m i f r e e binoid with
s e m i b a s i s (ai)i∈I if M is generated by {ai | i ∈ I} such that every element f ∈ M • can be written
uniquely as f =Pi∈I niai with ni = 0 for almost all i ∈ I. Then the set {ai | ni 6= 0} =: supp(f ) is
called the s u p p o r t of f . A commutative semibinoid S is semifree if the binoid S 0 is semifree.

Obviously, every ﬁnitely generated free commutative binoid is semifree, cf. also Corollary 1.4.28,
and a semibasis is always a minimal generating set. Semifree binoids represent an important class of
commutative binoids, for this see the characterization in Corollary 2.1.21.

Example 1.3.13.

(1) The binoid (N(I))∞ is semifree with semibasis ei, i ∈ I.
(2) The canonical generators 1 and −1 of Z∞ form no semibasis since 0 = n · 1 + n · (−1) for all
n ≥ 1. In fact, Z∞ is not semifree. Every minimal generating set of Z∞ is given by two integers
n, m ∈ Z with n > 0, m < 0, and gcd(n,−m) = 1. Hence, kn + lm = 1 for some k, l > 0,
which yields ˜kn + ˜lm = −1 for some ˜k, ˜l > 0 by adding mn − nm = 0 suﬃciently often to
−kn − lm = −1. By applying this to the equations above, we obtain a non-unique expression of
0 in terms of n and m. See also Lemma 1.4.23.

(3) The semibasis of the free commutative binoid (N,·, 1, 0) is given by {p | p ∈ N prime} by the

fundamental theorem of arithmetic, cf. [51, Hauptsatz 10.1].

(4) A commutative binoid with a non-trivial idempotent (see below, Section 1.4) is never semifree.
For instance, P(V )∪ is not semifree since A = A ∪ A = A ∪ A ∪ A = ··· for every A ⊆ V .
However, the singletons {v}, v ∈ V , V ﬁnite, generate P(V )∪ and every set A ⊆ V is uniquely
given as A = ∪v∈A{v}. Thus, P(V )∪ can be considered as semifree up to idempotence. In Section
6.1, we will encounter these kind of binoids.

(5) The generating set A = {1/pn1

1 ··· pnr

≥0, +, 0,∞) is no semibasis because, for instance, 1

1.4 Additivity properties

17

(6) The binoid FC(x1, x2)/(x1 + x2 = ∞) is semifree because every element 6= ∞ can be written
uniquely as nx1 or mx2 for certain n, m ≥ 0. This example shows that Lemma 1.3.10 need not
be true for semifree binoids since there exists, for instance, no binoid homomorphism

FC(x1, x2)/(x1 + x2 = ∞) −→ FC(y1, y2)

with xi 7→ yi, i ∈ {1, 2}.

(7) Another interesting class of semifree binoids are simplicial binoids, which will be introduced in

Section 6.5.

1.4 Additivity properties

This section deals with additivity properties of binoids. Before we recall classical concepts that
originate from monoid theory, we point out those properties of a binoid which have no counterpart
when there is no absorbing element, namely non-integrity and nilpotence. Concerning those properties
that translate directly from monoids to binoids we follow essentially [28]. Then the additively closed
subobjects of a binoid, its ﬁlters, are introduced. These are very useful when we are missing the theory
of (prime) ideals of a binoid. The connection will be shown in Chapter 2. We close this section with
the behavior of additive properties under homomorphisms.

The phenomena that may occur if an absorbing element exists are described in the following deﬁni-
tions.

Deﬁnition 1.4.1. Let M be a binoid (or semibinoid). An element a ∈ M is called n i l p o t e n t if
na = a +··· + a = ∞ for some n ≥ 1. The set of all nilpotent elements will be denoted by nil(M ). We
say M is r e d u c e d if nil(M ) = {∞}, and M is s t r o n g l y r e d u c e d if a + a + b = ∞ for a, b ∈ M
implies a + b = ∞.
Lemma 1.4.2.

(1) A strongly reduced binoid is reduced.

(2) A commutative binoid is strongly reduced if and only if it is reduced.

Proof. (1) If na = ∞ for some a and n ≥ 2 in a strongly reduced binoid, then by applying successively

∞ = na = a + a + (n − 2)a = a + (n − 2)a = (n − 1)a ,

we obtain ∞ = 2a = a + a + 0, which yields ∞ = a + 0 = a. (2) Any equation a + a + b = ∞ in a
commtative binoid yields 2(a + b) = ∞ by adding b. Hence, a + b = ∞ if the binoid is reduced.
Deﬁnition 1.4.3. Let M 6= {∞} be a binoid (or semibinoid). An i n t e g r a l element a ∈ M • satisﬁes
the property that a + b = ∞ or b + a = ∞ implies b = ∞. The set of all integral elements will be
denoted by int(M ) and the complement M \ int(M ) by intc(M ). We say M is i n t e g r a l if M • is a
submonoid (resp. subsemigroup) of M ; that is, M • consists only of integral elements.

Every binoid that emerges from a monoid by adjoining an absorbing element is integral, and all
integral binoids are of this type.

Example 1.4.4.
(1) By deﬁnition, (Nn)∞ is an integral binoid and (Zn)∞ is a binoid group (see below). On the

other hand, the binoids (N∞)n and (Z∞)n, n ≥ 2, are obviously not integral.

18

1 Basic concepts of binoids

(2) The notion of integrity for a ring R and for its underlying binoid (R,·, 1, 0) coincides; that is,
the non-integral elements are precisely the zero-divisors of R. Therefore, intc(R) = {0} if and
only if R is an (integral) domain.

(3) A binoid T∩ deﬁned by a topology on V is integral if and only if V is irreducible with respect to

T ; that is, V 6= ∅ and U ∩ V 6= ∅ for arbitrary nonempty open subsets U, V ⊆ T .
For instance, the binoid deﬁned by the Zariski topology on An
K and An(K) for n ≥ 1 and K an
algebraically closed ﬁeld, is integral as well as the binoids given by the subspace topology on an
(aﬃne) variety V ⊆ An

K, cf. [32, Chapter I.1].

(4) The binoid P(V )∩ is never integral for #V ≥ 2 since A ∩ Ac = ∅ for every subset A ⊂ V .
Similarly, P(V )∪ with #V ≥ 2 is never integral. From the criterion given in (3) we can easily
derive non-trivial integral subbinoids of P(V )∩ for #V ≥ 2, like h{Y, x1}, . . . ,{Y, xk}i ⊆ P(V )∩,
where ∅ 6= Y ( V such that V \ Y = {x1, . . . , xk} with k ≥ 1.

(5) The set of integral and non-integral elements in the product of a family (Mi)i∈I of binoids are

given by

and

int(cid:16)Yi∈I

Mi(cid:17) = Yi∈I

int(Mi)

intc(cid:16)Yi∈I

Mi(cid:17) = {(ai)i∈I | ak ∈ intc(Mk) for at least one k ∈ I} .

Lemma 1.4.5. Nilpotent elements are not integral; that is, nil(M ) ⊆ intc(M ) for every nonzero
binoid M . In particular, an integral binoid is reduced.

Proof. This follows directly from the deﬁnitions.

Lemma 1.4.6. The subset Mint := int(M ) ∪ {∞} ⊆ M is an integral subbinoid for every nonzero
binoid M .

Proof. This is easily veriﬁed.

Example 1.4.7. The binoid M := FC(x, y)/(x + y = ∞) has no non-trivial integral elements (i.e.
Mint = {0,∞}), but two non-trivial integral subbinoids, namely hxi and hyi.
Now we translate common properties of monoids (resp. semigroups) and their elements to binoids.
We start with the notions of units and idempotents which are independent of the existence of an
absorbing element.

Deﬁnition 1.4.8. Let M be a monoid (or nonzero binoid). An element u in M is a u n i t if there
exists an element a ∈ M such that a + u = u + a = 0. The element a is the unique (additive) i n v e r s e
of u and will be denoted by -u. The set of all units M × is a submonoid of M which is a group, the
u n i t g r o u p of M . The set of all nonunits M \ M × will be denoted by M+. We say M is p o s i t i v e if
it has a trivial unit group (i.e. M \ {0} = M+). A b i n o i d g r o u p is a binoid G such that G• = G×;
that is, G• is a group.

Among many other names for the property of a monoid or binoid to have a trivial unit group pointed
in combinatorics ([41]) and sharp in geometry ([45]) are also very common, while we follow [11].
We ﬁx the following notation: if R is a ring, then R∞ denotes the (commutative) binoid group that
arises by adjoining an absorbing element to R with respect to its additive structure. For instance,

(Zn)∞ = (Zn ∪ {∞}, +, (0, . . . , 0),∞) and (Z/mZ)∞ = (Z/mZ ∪ {∞}, +, [0],∞) ,

where n ≥ 1, and m ≥ 2.

Lemma 1.4.10. Every unit is integral; that is, M × ⊆ int(M ) for a nonzero binoid M .
Proof. Obvious.

=Qi∈I M ×

i .

Deﬁnition 1.4.11. Let M be a semigroup. An element f ∈ M is called i d e m p o t e n t if f + f = f .
In a b o o l e a n semigroup every element is idempotent. The set of all idempotent elements will be
denoted by bool(M ). A commutative semigroup that is boolean is called a s e m i l a t t i c e .

The operation of a semilattice L is usually denoted by ⊔ or ⊓ and L is called a j o i n - or m e e t -
semilattice, respectively. In either case, the operation gives rise to a partial order ≤ on L by setting
x ≤ y :⇔ x ⊔ y = y or x ≤ y :⇔ x ⊓ y = x.
Example 1.4.12.

(1) The identity element and the absorbing element are always idempotent elements. In particular,
the set of idempotents of a commutative binoid M is a subbinoid since 2(a + b) = 2a + 2b = a + b
for idempotent elements a, b ∈ M . More precisely, bool(M ) is the largest boolean subbinoid of
a commutative binoid M .

(2) The set P(V ) is a meet- and join-semilattice with respect to ∩ and ∪, respectively.
(3) The commutative binoid deﬁned by a topology is boolean such that ⊆ (⊇) is the induced partial
order with respect to the operation ∩ (∪). Moreover, Example 1.4.4(3) and (4) show that a
boolean binoid can be integral in contrast to a boolean algebra 6= {0}, which has characteristic
2 always.

Lemma 1.4.13. Every boolean binoid is positive and reduced.

Proof. Only the positivity of a boolean binoid need to be shown. For this let a + b = 0 for two
idempotent elements a and b. Adding a from the left and b from the right yields a = a + b = b, hence
a = b = 0.

The well-known notion of torsion and cancellativity in monoid theory need to be modiﬁed for binoids.

Deﬁnition 1.4.14. Let M be a binoid (or semibinoid). An element a in M is a t o r s i o n element if
a = ∞ or na = nb for some b ∈ M with b 6= a and n ≥ 2. We say M is t o r s i o n - f r e e if there are no
other torsion elements in M besides ∞; that is, na = nb implies a = b for every a, b ∈ M and n ≥ 1.
If na = nb 6= ∞ implies a = b for every a, b ∈ M and n ≥ 1, then M is called t o r s i o n - f r e e u p t o
n i l p o t e n c e .

By deﬁnition, a binoid is torsion-free if and only if it is reduced and torsion-free up to nilpotence.
With this notation, a monoid with no absorbing element is torsion-free if M ∞ is a torsion-free binoid.
A group G is a torsion group if and only if all elements of G∞ are torsion elements. In particular, the
unit group M × need not be torsion-free.
An important example of binoids that are torsion-free up to nilpotence but (in general) not reduced
is given in Corollary 2.1.21. The set of all torsion elements in a binoid that is torsion-free up to
nilpotence is precisely nil M . In general, the set of all torsion elements in M has no structure as the
following example shows.

Example 1.4.15. Consider the binoid M = FC(x, y)/(10x + 2y = ∞). The elements x and y are no
torsion elements but every element nx + my with n, m ≥ 1 is a torsion element.
Lemma 1.4.16.

(1) Nilpotent elements are torsion elements.

(2) Boolean binoids are torsion-free.

20

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proof. Both statements follow directly from the deﬁnitions.

The second statement of the preceding lemma shows that there are non-trivial ﬁnite binoids which
are torsion-free.

Deﬁnition 1.4.17. Let M be a commutative monoid (or binoid). Two elements a, b ∈ M are called
a s y m p t o t i c a l l y e q u i v a l e n t if there exists an n0 ∈ N with na = nb for all n ≥ n0. We say
that M is f r e e o f a s y m p t o t i c t o r s i o n if any two distinct elements of M are not asymptotic
equivalent.

Of course, asymptotically equivalent elements are torsion elements and nilpotent elements are asymp-
totically equivalent to ∞.
Lemma 1.4.18. Let M be a commutative binoid and a, b ∈ M . The following conditions on a and b
are equivalent:

(1) a and b are asymptotically equivalent.
(2) na = nb and (n + 1)a = (n + 1)b for an n ∈ N.
(3) na = nb and ma = mb for some n, m ∈ N with gcd(n, m) = 1.
Proof. The implications (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) are trivial. For (3) ⇒ (1) consider the set N := {l ∈ N∞ |
la = lb}. Obviously, N ⊆ N∞ is a subbinoid because all possible combinations of elements in N lie
in N . Now take n, m ∈ N with gcd(n, m) = 1. By [28, Theorem 2.2], there are for every k ∈ N with
k ≥ (n − 1)(m − 1) non-negative integers r and s such that k = rn + sm ∈ N . Hence, ka = kb for all
k ≥ (n − 1)(m − 1).
A weaker property than being asymptotically equivalent, called functionally equivalent, will come
into play at the end of Section 4.4.

Deﬁnition 1.4.19. Let M 6= {∞} be a binoid (or semibinoid). An element a ∈ M • is called
c a n c e l l a t i v e if from b + a = c + a 6= ∞ or a + b = a + c 6= ∞, for b, c ∈ M it follows b = c. We say
M is c a n c e l l a t i v e if every element 6= ∞ is cancellative. The set of all cancellative elements in M
will be denoted by can(M ). M is called r e g u l a r if it is integral and cancellative element.

A cancellative binoid has no non-trivial idempotent elements. The trivial binoid is regular, whereas
the zero binoid was excluded from the deﬁnitions of an integral and cancellative binoid.
Note that a cancellative element in a binoid need not be integral, it may even be nilpotent. For
instance, the binoid

FC(x)/(nx = ∞)

with n ≥ 2 is cancellative. Thus, for binoids, cancellativity is far from being such a strong property
as it is for monoids. The equivalent property for binoids is regularity because a binoid M is regular if
and only if M • is a cancellative monoid ; that is, M • is a monoid in which b + a = c + a or a + b = a + c
implies b = c for all a, b, c ∈ M . See also Lemma 1.4.21(2) and Proposition 1.7.14 with the subsequent
Remark 1.7.15. Similar to a cancellative commutative monoid, which can always be embedded in a
commutative group, cf. [28, Theorem 1.2], any regular commutative binoid M admits an embedding
M ֒→ G into a commutative binoid group G. For this result see Proposition 1.13.11.
Example 1.4.20. The binoid P(V )∩ is cancellative for #V < 3 and not cancellative for #V ≥ 3
since {1, 2} ∩{1, 3} = {1, 2} ∩{1}. By a similar argument, a subbinoid N ⊆ P(V )∩ is not cancellative
if there are A, B ∈ N with A ∩ B 6= ∅. Analogous statements hold for P(V )∪.
Lemma 1.4.21. Let M be a binoid.

(1) can(M )∞ is a cancellative subbinoid of M .

1.4 Additivity properties

21

(2) Units are cancellative. Conversely, if M is regular and ﬁnite, then M is a binoid group.

Proof. Both statements are easily veriﬁed except the converse of (2), which follows from the same
argument that proves the analogous statement in group theory.

Example 1.4.22. The binoid FC(x, y)/(x + y = y, 2x = x) has no non-trivial cancellative elements
(i.e. can(M )∞ = {0,∞}), but a non-trivial cancellative subbinoid, namely hyi.
Lemma 1.4.23. Semifree binoids are positive, cancellative, and torsion-free up to nilpotence.

Proof. This is easily veriﬁed.

The converse of the preceding lemma is false. For instance, the binoid

M := FC(x, y)/(2x = 3y)

is positive, torsion-free, and cancellative but not semifree. Note that {x, y} is a minimal generating
set of M (which is unique by Proposition 1.4.27 below) and that every element f ∈ M • can be written
uniquely as

f = my

or

f = x + my

for some m ∈ N. The positivity is clear. To show that M is torsion-free, one only needs to check
that an equation like k(x + my) = kny for some k ≥ 2 is not possible. This is true since otherwise
it would imply k = 2k′ and therefore yield the impossible equation 3 + 2m = 2n. Similarly, one can
show that the generators x and y are cancellative elements, which implies the cancellativity of M by
the following lemma.

Lemma 1.4.24. A binoid is integral or cancellative if and only if a generating set is so.

Proof. The only if part of the assertion is obvious. So let A ⊆ M be a generating set consisting of
integral elements and suppose that a + b = ∞ for some a, b ∈ M . Let b 6= ∞ so that b = ˜b + x for some
˜b ∈ M • and x ∈ A. Hence, ∞ = a + b = a + ˜b + x, which implies that a + ˜b = ∞ by the integrality
of x. Proceeding the same way yields a + y = ∞ for some y ∈ A, hence a = ∞. The assertion for the
cancellativity of M follows similarly.

Even if the generators of a binoid are no torsion elements, the binoid may not be torsion-free.
Consider, for instance, the binoid FC(a, b, c, d)/(n(a + b) = n(c + d)) with n ≥ 2. Also, a binoid
may have non-trivial cancellative elements though all generators are not cancellative as the following
example shows.

Example 1.4.25. The binoid M := FC(x, y)/(3x = 3y = ∞, 2x + y = x + 2y) is positive, not
reduced (hence not integral), and not cancellative since both generators x and y are not cancellative
for instance. However, a := 2x + y is a non-trivial cancellative element because

(2x + y) + x = ∞ and (2x + y) + y = (x + 2y) + y = x + 3y = ∞ ,

and so there are no equations like a + b = a + c 6= ∞ with b, c ∈ M .
Lemma 1.4.26. If M is an integral commutative binoid that admits a generating set of non-cancel-
lative elements, then M contains no non-trivial cancellative element.

Proof. Let A ⊆ can M be a generating set of M . By the assumption on A, there is for every f ∈ M •
an a ∈ A with f = ˜f + a and a + b = a + c 6= ∞ for some c, b ∈ M with c 6= b. Since M is integral the
latter equation implies that ˜f + a + b = ˜f + a + c 6= ∞ by adding ˜f . Hence, f + b = f + c 6= ∞ with
c 6= b.

22

1 Basic concepts of binoids

The preceding result may fail to be true for an integral binoid that is not commutative, like the
binoid F(x, y, z)/(z + x = z + y = x + y = x + z) in which the element x + y is cancellative.

Proposition 1.4.27. Every ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid M that is positive and cancellative
admits a unique minimal generating set given by M+ \ 2M+.
Proof. By the positivity, every generating set is contained in M+ = M \ {0}. First we show that the
set M+ \ 2M+ contains any minimal generating set, which implies that it is a generating set as well.
For this take an arbitrary minimal generating set {x1, . . . , xr} and assume that x1 6∈ M+\ 2M+. Then
x1 = y + z for some y, z ∈ M+. Hence, x1 = n1x1 + ··· + nrxr with at least two ni ≥ 1 or one ni ≥ 2,
i ∈ I. If n1 6= 0, the cancellativity of M yields a non-trivial equation 0 = (n1− 1)x1 + n2x2 +···+ nrxr
which is a contradiction to M × = {0}. Consequently, n1 = 0 and x1 can be dropped, contrary to the
minimality of the generating set. Thus, {x1, . . . , xr} ⊆ M+ \ 2M+.
The minimality of M+ \ 2M+ follows immediately because if x ∈ M+ \ 2M+ could be omitted, there
were an expression x = n1y1 + ··· + nsys with yi ∈ M+ \ 2M+ and at least one ni 6= 0, i ∈ {1, . . . , s}.
This means x = yi for some i ∈ {1, . . . , s} since x 6∈ 2M+, hence x cannot be omitted. The same
argument shows that M+ \ 2M+ must be contained in every generating set of M .
All conditions on a binoid assumed in Proposition 1.4.27 are required. Counterexamples of binoids
≥0, +), (Z/nZ)∞ with n ≥ 2, and
that fulﬁll all except one of the three conditions are given by (Q∞
FC(x, y)/(x + y = x).

Corollary 1.4.28. A ﬁnitely generated binoid is free commutative if and only if it is commutative,
integral and semifree.

Proof. All properties of a free commutative binoid follow from the fact that (Nn)∞ has these properties.
For the converse note that a binoid M with the given properties admits a unique minimal generating
set by Proposition 1.4.27, say M+ \ 2M+ = {x1, . . . , xn}. Since M is semifree and integral, the
canonical binoid epimorphism (Nn)∞ → M with ei 7→ xi, i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, is injective.
The proof of Proposition 1.4.27 shows that the set M+ \ 2M+ is ﬁnite. This can be generalized.
Lemma 1.4.29. Let M be a positive ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid. Then M+ \ nM+ is a
ﬁnite set for all n ≥ 1.
Proof. If {x1, . . . , xr} is a minimal generating set of M , then x1, . . . , xr ∈ M+ by the positivity of M ,

and hence nM+ = {n1x1 + ··· + nrxr |Pr

k=1 ni ≥ n}. This gives

#(M+ \ nM+) ≤ #{(n1, . . . , nr) | n1 + ··· + nr < n} =

n−1Xk=1 Xn1+···+nr=k(cid:18)

k

n1, . . . , nr(cid:19) .

In particular, M+ \ nM+ is ﬁnite for all n ≥ 1.
Deﬁnition 1.4.30. Let M be a positive ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid. The map

H(−, M ) : N −→ N

with H(n, M ) := #(M \nM+) for n ≥ 1 and H(0, M ) := 0, is called the H i l b e r t - S a m u e l f u n c t i o n

of M and H(M ) :=Pn∈N H(n, M )T n the H i l b e r t - S a m u e l s e r i e s of M .

H(1, M ) = −1 always holds.
Remark 1.4.31. As we will see later in Example 2.1.18(2), the deﬁnition of the Hilbert-Samuel
function is similar to that of a semilocal ring, cf. [53, Chapter II.B §4].

1.4 Additivity properties

23

Deﬁnition 1.4.32. Let A ⊆ P(V ) be a collection of subsets of an arbitrary set V . The collection A
is called s u b s e t - c l o s e d (resp. superset-closed) if B ⊆ A (resp. A ⊆ B) for some B ∈ P(V ) and
A ∈ A, implies B ∈ A; that is, with every set all its subsets (resp. supersets) lie in A. The set of all
subset-closed subsets of P(V ) will be denoted by S(V ).
Lemma 1.4.33. Let V 6= ∅ be an arbitrary set.
(1) S(V ) deﬁnes a topology on P(V ). In particular, S(V ) deﬁnes two boolean commutative binoids

with respect to ∪ and ∩, namely

(S(V ),∪,{∅}, P(V )) =: S(V )∪
which are integral if and only if #V = 1.

and (S(V ),∩, P(V ),{∅}) =: S(V )∩ ,

(2) A collection A ⊆ P(V ) is subset-closed if and only if P(V ) \ A is superset-closed. In particular,
the set Sc(V ) := {P(V ) \ A | A ∈ S(V )} of all superset-closed subsets of P(V ) deﬁnes two
boolean commutative binoids with respect to ∪ and ∩, namely

(Sc(V ),∪, V, P(V )) =: Sc(V )∪ and (Sc(V ),∩, P(V ), V ) =: Sc(V )∩ .

Proof. The ﬁrst statement of (1) is easily veriﬁed. For the supplement note that if there are i, j ∈ V
with i 6= j, then {∅,{i}} ∩ {∅,{j}} = {∅} and P(V \ {i}) ∪ P(V \ {j}) = P(V ). (2) Note that if
A ∈ S(V ) is subset-closed, then A ∈ P(V ) \ A means A 6∈ A. Hence, B 6∈ A for all B ∈ P(V ) with
A ⊆ B if A is subset-closed and A 6∈ A. This is equivalent to B ∈ P(V ) \ A for all B ∈ P(V ) with
A ⊆ B. Hence, P(V ) \ A is superset-closed. The supplement of (2) follows from (1).
The cardinality of the set of all subset-closed sets signiﬁcantly increases as V becomes larger. A
detailed computation shows, for instance, #S({1}) = 2, #S({1, 2}) = 4, #S({1, 2, 3}) = 19, and
#S({1, 2, 3, 4}) = 170
Now we introduce the common concept of ﬁlters to the theory binoids.

Deﬁnition 1.4.34. A subset F of a binoid M is a f i l t e r if the following conditions are satisﬁed.
(1) 0 ∈ F .
(2) If f, g ∈ F , then f + g ∈ F .
(3) If f + g ∈ F , then f, g ∈ F .
The f i l t r u m of M is the set of all ﬁlters in M and will be denoted by F (M ).
Loosely speaking, F ⊆ M is a ﬁlter if it is a submonoid with the property f + g ∈ F ⇒ f, g ∈ F .
The additional condition on a submonoid to be a ﬁlter may be called summand-closed. Since 0 is a
summand of every element of M , the ﬁrst condition can be replaced by F 6= ∅.
Remark 1.4.35. If R is a ring, then every proper ﬁlter of (R,·, 1, 0) is the complement of an arbitrary
union of (ring) prime ideals of R, and conversely, every complement of a ﬁlter is the union of (ring)
prime ideals. Of course, this union does not need to be unique. For instance, the set of invertible
elements R× is the complement of the union of all prime ideals as well as the complement of the union
of all maximal ideals. After establishing the necessary ideal theory for binoids in Chapter 2, we will
show that similarly, every ﬁlter 6= M in a binoid M is the complement of one unique prime ideal, cf.
Corollary 2.2.6. Therefore, considering proper ﬁlters or prime ideals in binoids amounts to the same
theory.

If (Fi)i∈I is a family of ﬁlters in M , then Ti∈I Fi is again a ﬁlter in M , and since every unit is a

summand of 0 the ﬁlter M × is contained in any other ﬁlter of M . Hence, the commutative binoid

F (M )∩ := (F (M ),∩, M, M ×)

24

1 Basic concepts of binoids

is a (meet-) semilattice with largest element M and smallest element M × with respect to set inclusion.
We will encounter this binoid frequently.

Deﬁnition 1.4.36. Let A be a subset of M . The ﬁlter Filt(A) g e n e r a t e d by A is the set of all
summands of sums that lie in A; in other words,

Filt(A) = \A⊆F ∈F (M)

F .

By deﬁnition, it is the smallest ﬁlter of M containing A. The ﬁlter generated by a singleton A = {f},
f ∈ M , will be denoted by Filt(f ).
Remark 1.4.37. Since M is the only ﬁlter containing ∞, we have Filt(f ) = M if and only if f is
nilpotent. Moreover, g ∈ Filt(f ) means g = n1f1 + ··· + nrfr for some summands f1, . . . , fr of f .
Therefore, g ∈ Filt(f ) is equivalent to g + x = nf for some suitable x ∈ M and n ∈ N.
The operation F ⋆ G := Filt(F + G), F, G ∈ F (M ), on F (M ) turns the set F (M ) into a commutative
binoid, namely

This binoid will appear later in Proposition 1.13.9.

F (M )⋆ := (F (M ), ⋆, M ×, M ) .

Example 1.4.38. Let V be a ﬁnite set. A subset F ⊆ P(V ) is a ﬁlter in P(V )∩ if and only if F is
superset-closed (which implies that V ∈ F ) and contains only one minimal element J ∈ P(V ) with
respect to ⊆. Thus, for every ﬁlter F , one has F = Filt(J) = {A ∈ P(V ) | J ⊆ A} for some J ⊆ V .
Similarly, a subset F ⊆ P(V ) is a ﬁlter in P(V )∪ if and only if F is subset-closed (which implies that
∅ ∈ F ) and contains only one maximal element J ∈ P(V ) with respect to ⊆. Thus, for every ﬁlter F ,
one has F = Filt(J) = {A ∈ P(V ) | A ⊆ J} = P(J) for some J ⊆ V . In particular, the one-to-one
correspondences

F (P(V )∩) ←→ P(V ) ←→ F (P(V )∪)

F 7−→ min⊆ F

{A ∈ P(V ) | J ⊆ A} ←−[

7−→ {A ∈ P(V ) | A ⊆ J} = P(J)

max⊆ F ←−[ F

yield the binoid isomorphisms P(V )∪ ∼= F (P(V )∩)∩ and P(V )∩ ∼= F (P(V )∪)∩.
Finally we take a look on the behavior of certain properties under a binoid homomorphism.

Lemma 1.4.39. Let ϕ : N → M be a binoid homomorphism.
(1) ϕ(nil(N )) ⊆ nil(M ).
(2) ϕ(bool(N )) ⊆ bool(M ).
(3) ϕ(N ×) ⊆ M ×. Moreover, if M is commutative, then ϕ−1(M ×) ∈ F (N ).
Proof. We only show the second part of the last assertion because all other statements are easily
veriﬁed. Set F := ϕ−1(M ×). Clearly, 0N ∈ F because ϕ is a binoid homomorphism. If a, b ∈ F ,
then ϕ(a), ϕ(b) ∈ M ×. Since M × is a group, we obtain ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b) ∈ M ×, which means
a + b ∈ F . Similarly, a + b ∈ F means ϕ(a + b) ∈ M ×. So there is an element u ∈ M × with ϕ(a + b) =
ϕ(a) + ϕ(b) = u. This yields ϕ(a) + (ϕ(b) + (-u)) = 0M = ϕ(b) + (ϕ(a) + (-u)), which shows that
ϕ(a), ϕ(b) ∈ M ×.

1.5 N - spectra

25

Remark 1.4.40. Note that the image of a non-integral element need not be non-integral under a
binoid homomorphism. If, for instance, a ∈ N \ nil(N ) is a non-integral element such that the set
A := {b ∈ N | a + b = ∞} ⊆ intc(N ) is contained in the kernel of ϕ : N → M , then ϕ(a) may even be
a unit, cf. Example 1.5.5(2). A trivial example is given by the binoid homomorphism

FC(x, y)/(x + y = ∞) −→ (Z/nZ)∞ ,

n ≥ 2, with x 7→ 1 and y 7→ ∞.
Proposition 1.4.41. Let M be a binoid. A map ϕ : M → {0,∞} is a binoid homomorphism if and
only if M \ ker ϕ ∈ F (M ).
Proof. Let F := M \ ker ϕ. We have ϕ(a + b) = 0 if and only if ϕ(a) = 0 = ϕ(b) since ϕ is a binoid
homomorphism and, in particular, ϕ(0M ) = 0N . Hence, 0M ∈ F , and a + b ∈ F is equivalent to
a, b ∈ F .
In Section 2.2, we will rephrase this result in terms of ideal theory, cf. Lemma 2.2.5.

1.5 N - spectra

The notion of homomorphisms between binoids yields the dual and bidual of a binoid as well as its
N - spectrum for another binoid N . The latter admits a geometric interpretation when N = K is a
ﬁeld, namely the K - spectrum of the associated binoid algebra, which will be treated in Section 4.4
in more detail. All these objects are illustrated by several examples.

By deﬁnition, every binoid homomorphism ϕ between nonzero binoids fulﬁlls {0,∞} ⊆ im ϕ. Those
homomorphisms ϕ with im ϕ = {0,∞} are uniquely determined by ker ϕ and closely related to the
prime ideals of the binoid, cf. Section 2.2.

Deﬁnition 1.5.1. Let M be a binoid and N an arbitrary subset of M . The map χN : M → {0,∞}
with a 7→ 0 if a ∈ N and ∞ otherwise, is called the i n d i c a t o r f u n c t i o n of N . The a n t i -
i n d i c a t o r f u n c t i o n χM\N of N will be denoted by αN . If an (anti-) indicator function is a binoid
homomorphism we call it an ( a n t i - ) i n d i c a t o r h o m o m o r p h i s m .

The indicator function is also known as the characteristic function and the codomain is usually the
trivial binoid with respect to the multiplication; that is, χN , N ⊆ M , is usually deﬁned to be the map
M → {1, 0} with a 7→ 1 if a ∈ N and 0 otherwise.
The set map(M,{0,∞}) can be naturally embedded into the set map(M, M ′) for any two nonzero
binoids M and M ′; that is, every function M → {0,∞} can be considered as a map M → M ′. Then
we will use the same notation χN and αN for the indicator and anti-indicator function of N ⊆ M in
map(M, M ′), respectively.

Remark 1.5.2. Let M and N be nonzero binoids. The set hom(M, N ) is a semigroup with respect
to the operation

(φ + ψ)(a) = φ(a) + ψ(a) ,

If N is boolean, then so is hom(M, N ).

φ, ψ ∈ hom(M, N ), a ∈ M . The semigroup hom(M, N ) is commutative if M = {0,∞} or if N
is commutative.
In particular, the set of all indicator
homomorphisms on M is a boolean subsemigroup of hom(M, N ).
We have χM • + ψ = ψ + χM • = ψ and χ{0} + ψ = ψ + χ{0} = χ{0} for all ψ : M → N .
In
general, the functions χM • , χ{0} : M → N are no homomorphisms. More precisely, χM • is a binoid
homomorphism if and only if M • is a monoid, and χ{0} is a binoid homomorphism if and only if M is

26

positive. Thus, (hom(M, N ), +, χM • , χ{0}) is a binoid if and only M • is a positive monoid. However,
one can always adjoin an absorbing and an identity element to get a binoid. For instance, the constant
maps αM : a 7→ ∞ and χM : a 7→ 0, a ∈ M , can serve as an absorbing and as an identity element,
respectively.

Deﬁnition 1.5.3. Let M and N be binoids. The semigroup (hom(M, N ), +) =: N - spec M is called
the N - s p e c t r u m of M and we refer to an element of N - spec M as an N - p o i n t of M .
With this notation, the semilattice of all indicator homomorphisms on M , which is contained in
N - spec M , is denoted by {0,∞}- spec M . By Proposition 1.4.41,

{0,∞}- spec M = {χF | F ∈ F (M )} .

The N - point χM × : M → N is called the s p e c i a l p o i n t of M . In general, we refer to an N - point
χF : M → N given by a ﬁlter F ∈ F (M ) as a c h a r a c t e r i s t i c (or b o o l e a n ) p o i n t of M . We
use this terminology, in particular, if N is the trivial binoid.

Remark 1.5.4. The terminology introduced here becomes clear later when we will see that the ﬁlters
in M are precisely the complements of the prime ideals in M , cf. Corollary 2.2.6. Hence, the special
point χM × = αM+ corresponds to the maximal ideal M+ (maximal with respect to ⊆ since M × is the
smallest ﬁlter and contained in any other ﬁlter), and the characteristic points χF = αM\F , F ∈ F (M ),
correspond to the the prime ideals M \ F .
For a ﬁeld K, the K - spectrum of a binoid M can be identiﬁed with the K - spectrum K- spec K[M ] :=
HomK- alg(K[M ], K) of K[M ], cf. Propostition 3.2.3, which is a well-studied topological space if M
is commutative. Section 4.4 and in most parts Chapter 5 are devoted to a detailed description of
the set of K - points of M by applying the knowledge of K- spec K[M ], where K is a ﬁeld and M a
commutative binoid. Once in a while, we anticipate this description of the K - spectrum of a binoid
and draw a picture of the R - spectrum.

Example 1.5.5. Let N be a commutative binoid.
(1) By Lemma 1.4.39(2), N - spec FC(x)/(2x = x) ∼= bool N .
(2) Every binoid homomorphism {0,∞}n → N is uniquely determined by the images of the gen-
erators e1,∞, . . . , en,∞. Since the elements ei,∞ are idempotent their images lie in bool N , and
because there are no further relations than e1,∞ + ··· + en,∞ = ∞Π, we get

N - spec{0,∞}n = {(a1, . . . , an) ∈ (bool N )n | a1 + ··· + an = ∞} .

In particular, N - spec{0,∞} ∼= {∞} and {0,∞}- spec{0,∞}n ∼= {0,∞}n \ {0Π}, which one may
also obtain from Proposition 1.8.14.
We have to postpone the determination of N - specQi∈I Mi for an arbitrary family (Mi)i∈I of binoids

because a little more theory is needed for this, cf. Proposition 1.8.14.

Proposition 1.5.6. Let M , N , and L be binoids. Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N induces
a semigroup homomorphism ϕ∗ : L- spec N −→ L- spec M with ψ 7→ ψϕ. Moreover, ϕ∗ is injective if
ϕ is surjective.

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is trivial. For the supplement, we need to show that ψ = ψ′ if ψϕ = ψ′ϕ,
but this follows from the surjectivity of ϕ.

Lemma 1.5.7. If N is a nonzero binoid, then N - spec(N(I))∞ ∼= N (I) as binoids. In particular, for
every ﬁnitely generated free commutative binoid M there is a unique n ≥ 1 such that N - spec M ∼= N n.

1.5 N - spectra

27

Proof. Since (N(I))∞ is integral, positive, and bool((N(I))∞) = {0,∞}, the images of the elements
of the basis (ei)i∈I , which determine every homomorphism on (N(I))∞, can be choosen at will in N .
Moreover, (N - spec(N(I))∞, +, χM • , χ{0}) is a binoid by Remark 1.5.2. The supplement is clear by
the deﬁnition of a free commutative binoid.

Lemma 1.5.8. Let M and N be binoids. If N is positive, the homomorphism χM × : M → N is an
absorbing element in N - spec M . In particular, N - spec M is a boolean semibinoid if N is a boolean
binoid.

Proof. By Proposition 1.4.41, the characteristic function χM × is a binoid homomorphism. Since N is
positive, ϕ(f ) = 0 for all f ∈ M × and all ϕ ∈ N - spec M . It follows

(χM × + ϕ)(f ) = χM ×(f ) + ϕ(f ) = (0 + 0

, if f ∈ M × ,
∞ + ϕ(f ) = ∞ , otherwise.

= χM × (f ) ,

and (ϕ+ χM ×)(f ) = χM × in the same manner. The supplement is clear by Lemma 1.4.13 and Remark
1.5.2.

Corollary 1.5.9. N - spec(−) is a contravariant functor from the category of binoids B into the
category of (boolean) semibinoids for every positive (boolean) binoid N .
Proof. This follows from Lemma 1.5.8. If ϕ : M → M ′ is a morphism in the category of binoids, the
morphism hom(ϕ, N ) : hom(M ′, N ) → hom(M, N ) is given by ψ 7→ ψϕ.
Corollary 1.5.10. The canonical maps χ 7→ M \ ker χ and χF ←[ F are semibinoid isomorphisms
between {0,∞}- spec M and (F (M ) \ {M},∩, M ×) which are inverse to each other.
Proof. The bijectivity is just a restatement of Proposition 1.4.41. The easy computations

ker(χ + χ′) = {f ∈ M | χ(f ) + χ′(f ) = ∞}

= {f ∈ M | χ(f ) = ∞} ∪ {f ∈ M | χ′(f ) = ∞} = ker χ ∪ ker χ′

and

χF ∩F ′(f ) =(0

, if f ∈ F and f ∈ F ′

∞ , otherwise,

= χF (f ) + χF ′ (f ) = (χF + χF ′ )(f )

prove the homomorphism property for both assignments.

Deﬁnition 1.5.11. The boolean binoid

M v := (hom(M,{0,∞}) ∪ {χM}, +, χM , χM ×)

is the d u a l and M vv is the b i d u a l of M .

The bidual realizes the booleanization of ﬁnitely generated commutative binoids, cf. Corollary 4.2.10.
Example 1.5.12. Let M be a binoid. If 0 is an adjoint identity element, then (M 0)v = {ψ0 | ψ ∈
M v}, where ψ0 is the extension of ψ to M 0. In particular, (M 0)v ∼= M v .
If M is a ﬁnitely generated free commutative binoid, then M v = ({0,∞}n)0 for some n ≥ 1 by
Lemma 1.5.7, and hence M vv = {0,∞}n.
Remark 1.5.13. There is a canonical binoid homomorphism δ : M → M vv with f 7→ δf , where
δf : M v → {0,∞} is the evaluation δf (χ) := χ(f ) at f for every χ ∈ M v . Note that ker δ = nil(M ),
hence δf coincides with the absorbing element χ(M v )× : ϕ 7→ ∞ of M vv if and only if f ∈ nil(M ).
Moreover, δf coincides with the identity element χM v : ϕ 7→ 0 of M vv if and only if f ∈ M ×.

28

1 Basic concepts of binoids

The Example 1.5.12 above shows that M vv 6= M happens. Later we will show that the homo-
morphism δ of the preceding remark is an isomorphism (i.e. M vv ∼= M ) if and only if M is ﬁnitely
generated and boolean, cf. Corollary 4.2.10. Hence, (M v )vv = M v for all ﬁnitely generated binoids
M , cf. Corollary 4.2.11. In particular, P(V )vv
∩ 6= P(V )∩ if and only if V is inﬁnite. So far, we have
the following examples.

Example 1.5.14. By Example 1.5.5(2), ({0,∞}n)v = {0,∞}n, and hence ({0,∞}n)vv = {0,∞}n.
In particular, P

n,∪ = Pn,∪ by Example 1.2.4(1).

n,∪ = P

n,∩ = P

n,∩ = Pn,∩ and P

M v = M need not be true for every ﬁnitely generated boolean binoid as the following example shows.

Example 1.5.15. For the boolean binoid B = FC(b1, b2, b3)/(b1 + b2 = ∞, 2bi = bi, i ∈ {1, 2, 3}),
one has Bv = hχ1, χ2, χ1,3, χ2,3i, where χI , I ⊆ {1, 2, 3}, is the indicator homomorphism B → {0,∞}
deﬁned by bi 7→ 0 for i ∈ I. Hence, Bv 6= B. If one denotes the generators of Bv by d1, d2, d3, and
d4, then (with the same notation as above) Bvv ∼= hχ1,2, χ1,3, χ2,4i ∼= B.

1.6 Congruences

Homomorphisms on a monoid M and its homomorphic images are closely related to the notion of
congruences on M , see [28, Chapter I.4], [29, Chapter I.3 and I.4], or [30, Chapter I.2]. This relation
transfers to binoids since a congruence on a binoid is nothing else than a congruence on the underlying
monoid, cf. Proposition 1.6.2. At the end of this section we prove R´edei’s Theorem for ﬁnitely generated
commutative binoids. In the next section, we will give attention to speciﬁc congruences with which
we will be concerned later.

Deﬁnition 1.6.1. A c o n g r u e n c e on a binoid M is an equivalence relation ∼ on M that is compatible
with the addition; that is, if a, b ∈ M with a ∼ b, then a + c ∼ b + c and c + a ∼ c + b for all c ∈ M .
We denote the congruence class of a ∈ M by [a], sometimes also by ¯a, and the set of all congruence
classes by M/ ∼. Let ∼1 and ∼2 be two congruences on a binoid. The i n t e r s e c t i o n ∼1 ∩ ∼2 is the
congruence ∼ on M deﬁned by a ∼ b for a, b ∈ M if a ∼1 b and a ∼2 b. We write ∼1 ≤ ∼2 if a ∼1 b
implies a ∼2 b for all a, b ∈ M .
On the set of congruences on a binoid, ≤ deﬁnes a partial order under which there always exist a
largest and a smallest congruence, which means there are congruences ∼u and ∼id such that ∼id ≤
∼ ≤ ∼u for all congruences ∼ on the binoid. These are given by the u n i v e r s a l congruence ∼u,
which relates any two elements with each other, and the i d e n t i t y congruence ∼id, under which two
elements are related only when they coincide.

Before studying congruences on free commutative and ﬁnitely generated binoids, the equivalent notion
of homomorphisms and congruences on a binoid is described in the following proposition.

Proposition 1.6.2. Let M be a binoid. Given a congruence ∼ on M , the quotient M/∼ is a binoid
with respect to the operation [a] + [b] := [a + b] such that the canonical map M → M/∼, a 7→ [a], is
an epimorphism of binoids. Conversely, if ϕ : M → N is a binoid epimorphism, then the relation ∼ϕ
on M deﬁned by a ∼ϕ b if ϕ(a) = ϕ(b), is a congruence on M such that M/∼ϕ → N , [a] 7→ ϕ(a), is
a binoid isomorphism.

Proof. It is easily checked that M/∼ is a binoid with respect to the given operation and that ∼ϕ
deﬁnes a congruence on M . The converse follows from the subsequent lemma.

1.6 Congruences

29

Lemma 1.6.3. If ϕ : M → N is a binoid homomorphism and ∼ a congruence on M with ∼ ≤ ∼ϕ,
then there is a unique binoid homomorphism ˜ϕ such that the diagram

M

π

N

ϕ

<②②②②②②②②

˜ϕ

commutes. In particular, given two congruences ∼1 and ∼2 on M , the relation ∼1 ≤ ∼2 is equivalent
to the fact that the map M/∼1 → M/∼2, [a]1 7→ [a]2, is a well-deﬁned binoid epimomorphism.
Proof. Deﬁne ˜ϕ([a]) := ϕ(a). To show that this is well-deﬁned assume that [a] = [b] for a, b ∈ M .
By assumption, a ∼ϕ b, and hence ˜ϕ([a]) = ϕ(a) = ϕ(b) = ˜ϕ([b]). By deﬁnition, ˜ϕ is a binoid
homomorphism with ˜ϕπ = ϕ, and hence unique. The situation of the supplement is expressed in the
following diagram

M/ ∼2

M

π1

π2

:ttttttttt

˜ϕ

M/ ∼1
with π2 = ˜ϕπ1 surjective. Hence, ˜ϕ is surjective.

Remark 1.6.4. In standard literature, the congruence ∼ϕ deﬁned by a monoid homomorphism
ϕ : M → N as in Proposition 1.6.2 is usually denoted by ker ϕ, see for example [29], [30], or [49].
Most probably this is due to the fact that the famous isomorphism theorem

M/∼ϕ ∼= im ϕ

can be stated with the common notation, cf. for instance [49, Proposition 8.2], and maybe because there
is no absorbing element taken into account that justiﬁes our deﬁnition of ker. Note that (continuing
with our notation) the binoid homomorphism induced by ker ϕ need not be an isomorphism, see
Remark 2.1.17 below. On the other hand, if ϕ is a binoid homomorphism such that ϕ|M\ker ϕ is
injective, which means that ker ϕ is deﬁned by the congruence ∼ϕ, then the induced homomorphism
is an isomorphism, cf. Remark 2.1.17. For instance, the congruences given in Lemma 1.7.6 below
reﬂect this situation.

It is very common to identify a congruence ∼ with the set R(∼) := {(a, b) | a ∼ b} ⊆ M × M . For
instance, R(∼u) = M × M and R(∼id) is the diagonal D := {(a, a) | a ∈ M} ⊆ M × M . On the other
hand, every subset R ⊆ M × M generates a congruence on M . For this set
R′ := {(a + c, b + c) | (a, b) ∈ R ∪ R−1 ∪ D, c ∈ M} ,

where R−1 = {(b, a) | (a, b) ∈ R}. Now the relation ∼R on M given by

a ∼R b

:⇔ ∃ a = a1, a2, . . . , an = b

such that

(ai, ai+1) ∈ R′ ,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} ,

is a congruence on M .

Deﬁnition 1.6.5. Let M be a binoid and R ⊆ M × M a subset. The congruence ∼R deﬁned as
above is the congruence g e n e r a t e d by the r e l a t i o n s R. A congruence ∼ on a binoid M is called
f i n i t e l y g e n e r a t e d if there exists a ﬁnite subset R ⊆ M × M such that ∼ is the congruence
generated by R.

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Remark 1.6.6. (Noetherian binoids) The set of all cogruences on a binoid M is a partially ordered
set with respect to ≤, where ∼1 ≤ ∼2 is equivalent to R(∼1) ⊆ R(∼2).
In [28, Chapter 1.4], Gilmer deﬁned a commutative monoid M to be n o e t h e r i a n if this order on
the set of congruences on M is noetherian; that is to say, M satisﬁes the ascending chain condition
(a.c.c.) on congruences, or in other words, for every chain ∼1 ≤ ∼2 ≤ ∼3 ≤ ··· of congruences
there is a k ∈ N such that ∼n = ∼k for all n ≥ k. Equivalently, every congruence on M is ﬁnitely
generated. Moreover, Gilmer showed that a commutative monoid is noetherian if and only if it is
ﬁnitely generated, cf. [28, Theorem 5.10 and 7.8]. Since a binoid is ﬁnitely generated if and only if
it is ﬁnitely generated as a monoid, and a congruence on a binoid is a congruence on the underlying
monoid, we have the same statement for commutative binoids. Thus, considering noetherian or ﬁnitely
generated commutative binoids amounts to the same thing.
There is another (weaker) deﬁnition of noetherian in use by several authors in terms of ideals, cf.
Remark 2.1.26.

Example 1.6.7. Let M be a commutative binoid generated by {ai | i ∈ I}. If ε : FC(I) → M is the
canonical epimorphism i 7→ ai, then M ∼= FC(I)/ ∼ε by Proposition 1.6.2. Thus, M is given by the
generating set {ai | i ∈ I} and the family of relations ε(yj) = ε(zj) (i.e. Rj : yj ∼ε zj, j ∈ J), which
generate ∼ε. This justiﬁes the notation given in Deﬁnition 1.3.1,

M = FC(I)/(Rj)j∈J .

If #I = r, then M ∼= (Nr)∞/∼ε, where ε : ei 7→ ai, i ∈ {1, . . . , r}. In Section 1.12, ﬁnitely generated
commutative binoids are studied in detail.

Similar to the situation for semigroups and monoids the index set J in the preceding example can
be replaced by a ﬁnite subset if M is a ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid. This result is known
as the Theorem of R´edei, and the proof for binoids is identical.

Lemma 1.6.8. (Preston) Let ∼ be a congruence on the free commutative binoid (Nn)∞ and I(∼) the
ideal in the polynomial ring Z[X1, . . . , Xn], which is the binoid algebra of (Nn)∞ over Z, generated
by the binomials X a − X b, where a, b ∈ (Nn)∞ such that a ∼ b and X c = X c1
n for c =
(c1, . . . , cn) ∈ Nn and X ∞ = 0. Then a ∼ b if and only if X a − X b ∈ I(∼).
Proof. The proof of the statement for the monoid Nn can be found in [30, VI, Lemma 1.1] for instance.
The argumentation for (Nn)∞ is exactly the same.

1 ··· X cn

Theorem 1.6.9. (R´edei) Every congruence on the free commutative binoid (Nn)∞ is ﬁnitely gener-
ated.

Proof. Let ∼ be a congruence on (Nn)∞. If ∼ is not ﬁnitely generated, there exists an ascending chain
R1 ⊂ R2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Rk ⊂ ··· of ﬁnite subsets of R(∼) = {(a, b) | a ∼ b}, which induces an ascending
chain of congruences

on (Nn)∞. By assumption on ∼, this chain cannot become stationary, and hence the same holds for
the ascending chain of ideals

∼R1 ≤ ∼R2 ≤ ··· ≤ ∼Rk ≤ ···

I(∼R1) ⊆ I(∼R2) ⊆ ··· ⊆ I(∼Rk ) ⊆ ···

in Z[X1, . . . , Xn] by Lemma 1.6.8, contrary to Hilbert’s Basis Theorem, cf. [47, Theorem 1.C.4].

Similar to the theory of monoids, the following consequence of Theorem 1.6.9 may be called R´edei’s
Theorem for ﬁnitely generated commutative binoids.

1.7 Important congruences

31

Corollary 1.6.10. Every ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid M with generators x1, . . . , xr admits
ﬁnitely many relations R1, . . . ,Rs such that M ∼= FC(x1, . . . , xr)/(Rj, j ∈ {1, . . . , s}).
Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 1.6.9 since M ∼= (Nr)∞/ ∼ε, where ε : (Nr)∞ → M is
the canonical binoid homomorphism ei 7→ xi, i ∈ {1, . . . , r}.
Example 1.6.11. Though ﬁnite, the number of relations on a ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid
might be arbitrary large as the following example of binoids with only two generators shows:

Mn := FC(x, y)/(Rk, k ∈ {n, n + 1, . . . , 2n − 1}) with Rk : kx = ky ,

n ≥ 2. Every such binoid Mn is obviously positive, integral, and not torsion-free. Moreover, Mn is
not cancellative since x is not cancellative as

x + ((n − 1)x + y) = nx + y = ny + y = (n + 1)y = (n + 1)x = x + nx

but (n − 1)x + y 6= nx. Similarly, y is not cancellative, which already implies that Mn contains no
non-trivial cancellative elements by Lemma 1.4.26.

Corollary 1.6.12. If M is a ﬁnitely generated or commutative binoid, then so is M/∼.
Proof. This is clear.

Of course, if ∼ is a congruence on a binoid M , not all properties of M transfer to M/∼. In fact, the
binoid M/∼ might be nicer than the initial binoid M if M 6= (Nr)∞, r ≥ 1.

1.7 Important congruences

In this section, we give a list of some congruences with which we will be concerned in this thesis. Most
of them have a well-known counterpart in monoid theory, see for instance [28, Chapter I.4].

Deﬁnition 1.7.1. A congruence ∼ on M with the property that π : M → M/ ∼ is injective on
M \ ker π is called an i d e a l c o n g r u e n c e .
Example 1.7.2. Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N deﬁnes a (very important) ideal congruence
on M , namely a ∼ker ϕ b if a = b or a, b ∈ ker ϕ. The elements of M/∼ker ϕ are given by [a] = {a} if
a 6∈ ker ϕ and [a] = [∞] otherwise. In the following, we will make use of the notation

M/ ker ϕ

for M/ ∼ker ϕ. This notation will be justiﬁed in Section 2.1, where we will see that the congruence
deﬁned by an ideal is an ideal congruence and every ideal congruence is up to isomorphism given by
an ideal, cf. Remark 2.1.17.

Lemma 1.7.3. Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N factors uniquely through M/ ker ϕ such that
M/ ker ϕ is integral if N is so.

Proof. The factorization ˜ϕ : M/ ker ϕ → N follows from Lemma 1.6.3 and the supplement from the
fact that ˜ϕ(a) = ∞ is equivalent to a = ∞.
Lemma 1.7.4. If M is a positive binoid, then so is M/ ∼ for every ideal congruence ∼.
Proof. This is clear.

32

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proposition 1.7.5. Let M be a binoid and ∼ an ideal congruence on M . If π : M → M/∼ denotes
the canonical projection, then

N - spec(M/∼) ∼= {ϕ ∈ N - spec M | ker π ⊆ ker ϕ}

as semigroups.

Proof. The canonical projection π : M → M/∼ induces by Proposition 1.5.6 a semigroup homomor-
phism N - spec M/∼ → N - spec M with ψ 7→ ψπ such that ψπ(a) = ∞ for all a ∈ π−1([∞]). On the
other hand, if ϕ ∈ N - spec M with ker π ⊆ ker ϕ, then ∼ ≤ ∼ϕ, and hence ϕ factors through a binoid
homomorphism ˜ϕ : M/∼ → N with ϕ = ˜ϕπ by Lemma 1.6.3. This shows that N - spec(M/∼) → {ψ ∈
N - spec M | ker π ⊆ ker ϕ} with ψ 7→ ψπ is surjective, and it is injective because φπ = ψπ implies
φ = ψ by the surjectivity of π.

Lemma 1.7.6. Let M be a commutative binoid.
(1) The relation ∼int on M given by a ∼int b if a = b or a, b ∈ intc(M ), is an ideal congruence such

that M/∼int ∼= Mint.

that M/∼red=: Mred.

(2) The relation ∼red on M given by a ∼red b if a = b or a, b ∈ nil(M ), is an ideal congruence such

Proof. Clearly, ∼int and ∼red are equivalence relations. To show that ∼int is a congruence let a, b ∈ M
with a ∼int b. Clearly, a = b implies a + c = b + c for all c ∈ M . So consider the case a, b ∈ intc(M ).
Then a + x = ∞ = b + y for some x, y ∈ M • . By the commutativity of M , we obtain (a + c) + x =
∞ = (b + c) + y for all c ∈ M , which shows a + c ∼int b + c. The last assertion of (1) follows from
the observation that [a] = [∞] if and only if a ∈ intc(M ) and [a] = {a} otherwise. The poof of (2) is
similar to that of (1).
Corollary 1.7.7. If M is a commutative and N a reduced binoid, then N - spec M ∼= N - spec Mred as
semigroups.

Proof. By Proposition 1.5.6, the canonical projection π : M → Mred induces an injective semigroup
homomorphism N - spec Mred → N - spec M , ψ 7→ ψπ. For the surjectivity, we need to show that
every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N factors through π : M → Mred; that is, ϕ = ˜ϕπ for a binoid
homomorphism ˜ϕ : M → N . Since N is reduced, ϕ(a) = ∞N for every a ∈ nil(M ) and ϕ ∈ N - spec M .
Hence ∼red ≤ ∼ϕ. Now the surjectivity follows from Lemma 1.6.3.
Deﬁnition 1.7.8. Let M be a commutative binoid. Two elements a, b ∈ M are called a s s o c i a t e d
if a = b + u for some unit u of M .

Lemma 1.7.9. Let M be a commutative binoid. The relation ∼pos on M given by a ∼pos b if a, b are
associated, is a congruence such that M/∼pos =: Mpos is a positive binoid. Moreover, Mpos ∼= M if

and only if M is positive.

Proof. Clearly, ∼pos is an equivalence relation. To show that it is a congruence let a ∼pos b. Then
a = b + u for some u ∈ M ×, which implies a + c = b + c + u for all c ∈ M by the commutativity of
M . Hence, a + c ∼pos b + c. The last assertion follows from the observation that [u] = [0] for every
unit u. The supplement is clear.

The composition of the canonical embedding ι and the canonical projection πpos

(M ×)∞ ι−→ M
yields πposι(u) = [0] for all u ∈ M ×.
In general, M is not the product of (M ×)∞ and Mpos, i.e.
M 6∼= (M ×)∞ × Mpos. This already follows for M ﬁnite often from a counting argument. If #M × = k

and a 6= a+ u for a 6= ∞ and u ∈ M ×\{0} (which holds for example if M is separated, cf. Section 5.1),
then the equivalence classes with respect to ∼pos have all k elements with the exception of [∞] = {∞}.
If #Mpos = n + 1, then M has kn + 1 elements and not (k + 1)(n + 1) as the product. See also Remark
1.8.5 and Example 1.8.6.

There are also congruences related to torsion-freeness, asymptotically equivalence, and cancellativity.

Lemma 1.7.10. Let M be a commutative binoid.
(1) The relation ∼tf on M given by a ∼tf b if na = nb for some n ≥ 1, is a congruence such that
M/∼tf =: Mtf is a torsion-free binoid. In particular, Mtf ∼= M if and only if M is torsion-free.
(2) The relation ∼ae on M given by a ∼ae b if a, b are asymptotically equivalent, is a congruence such

that M/∼ae is free of asymptotic torsion.

Proof. (1) Obviously, ∼tf is reﬂexive and symmetric. If a ∼tf b and b ∼tf c, say na = nb and mb = mc
for n, m ≥ 1, then (nm)a = (nm)c, and hence ∼tf is transitive. By the commutativity of M , the
relation ∼tf is compatible with the operation on M since na = nb implies n(a + c) = na + nc =
nb + nc = n(b + c) for every c ∈ M . Finally, M/ ∼tf is torsion-free because if n[a] = n[b], then
m(na) = m(nb) for some m ≥ 1, hence [a] = [b]. The poof of (2) is similar to that of (1).
Lemma 1.7.11. Let M be a commutative binoid.

(1) If M is positive, then so is Mtf .
(2) If N is a torsion-free binoid, then N - spec M ∼= N - spec Mtf as semigroups.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement is obvious and the second follows similar to Corollary 1.7.7

Lemma 1.7.12. Let M be a commutative binoid and S a submonoid of M . The relation ∼can,S on
M given by a ∼can,S b if a + s = b + s for some s ∈ S, is a congruence such that [s] is cancellative in
M/∼can,S=: Mcan,S for all s ∈ S.
Proof. Only the transitivity is not trivial. So assume that a ∼can,S b and b ∼can,S c for a, b, c ∈ M .
Then a + s = b + s and b + t = c + t for some s, t ∈ S. Since M is commutative, this gives
a + (s + t) = b + s + t = c + (s + t) with s + t ∈ S. Hence, a ∼can,S c.
If S is a submonoid of M such that ∞ ∈ S, then all elements are congruent to each other, in which
case Mcan,S = {[∞]}. Note that the binoid Mcan,S need not be positive if M is so. However, we will
prove later, cf. Lemma 5.1.14, that this is true if M contains no elements f ∈ M • with f = f + g for
some g 6= 0.
Deﬁnition 1.7.13. Let M be a commutative binoid. The binoid Mcan := Mcan,int M is called the
c a n c e l l a t i o n (binoid) of M .

Proposition 1.7.14. Let M be a commutative and C a regular binoid.
(1) Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → C with ker ϕ ∩ int M = ∅ factors uniquely through Mcan.
(2) Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → C has a unique factorization

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proof. The second statement follows from the ﬁrst since the factorization through M/ ker ϕ satisﬁes
the assumption of (1) by Lemma 1.7.3. By Lemma 1.6.3, it suﬃces to show that under the assumptions
of (1) on ϕ : M → C one has ∼can,int M ≤ ∼ϕ. So let ker ϕ∩ int M = ∅ and assume that a ∼can,int M b.
This is equivalent to a + s = b + s for a, b ∈ M and s ∈ int M , which gives
ϕ(a) + ϕ(s) = ϕ(a + s) = ϕ(b + s) = ϕ(b) + ϕ(s) .

If this is ∞, then ϕ(a) = ϕ(b) = ∞ because of the integrality of C and ϕ(s) 6= ∞ by assumption.
In the other case, when ϕ(a) + ϕ(s) = ϕ(b) + ϕ(s) 6= ∞, the cancellativity of C yields ϕ(a) = ϕ(b).
Hence, a ∼ϕ b.
Remark 1.7.15. The preceding result may fail when the binoid C is cancellative but not integral.
As an example consider M := FC(x, y)/(x + y = 2x + y, 2y = ∞) and the binoid homomorphism

ϕ : M −→ N∞ × (N∞/(2 = ∞)) ,

deﬁned by x 7→ (1, 1) and y 7→ (∞, 1). The two sets

ker ϕ = {nx + my | n, m ≥ 1} and

int M = {nx | n ≥ 1}

are disjoint, but ϕ does not factor through Mcan = M/(y = x + y) = FC(x, y)/(y = x + y, 2y = ∞).
Finally we apply these congruences to the product of a family of binoids.

Lemma 1.7.16. Let (Mi)i∈I be a family of nonzero binoids and Si ⊆ Mi, i ∈ I, a family of sub-
monoids.

(1) (cid:0)Qi∈I Mi(cid:1)int =(cid:16)Qi∈I int(Mi)(cid:17) ∪ {∞Π}.
(2) (cid:0)Qi∈I Mi(cid:1)pos =Qi∈I (Mi)pos.
(3) If I is ﬁnite, then(cid:0)Qi∈I Mi(cid:1)tf =Qi∈I (Mi)tf .
(4) If S :=Qi∈I Si, then(cid:0)Qi∈I Mi(cid:1)can,S =Qi∈I (Mi)can,Si.
(ai)i∈I , (bi)i∈I ∈ Qi∈I Mi is equivalent to (ai + ui)i∈I = (ai)i∈I + (ui)i∈I = (bi)i∈I + (ui)i∈I =
(bi + ui)i∈I , where (ui)i∈I ∈ (Qi∈I Mi)× = Qi∈I M ×
m(ai)i∈I = m(bi)i∈I with m :=Qi∈I ni. Hence, (ai)i∈I ∼tf (bi)i∈I inQi∈I Mi.

i , cf. Example 1.4.9, which is equivalent to
ai ∼pos bi on Mi for all i ∈ I. Similarly, one proves (4). (3) It is clear that (ai)i∈I ∼tf (bi)i∈I implies
ai ∼tf bi on Mi for all i ∈ I. Conversely, if for all i ∈ I there is an ni ≥ 1 such that niai = nibi, then

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows from Example 1.4.4(5). (2) By deﬁnition, (ai)i∈I ∼pos (bi)i∈I for

Remark 1.7.17.

(1) There is no similar result for ∼red. For instance, if N and M are binoids, a, a′ ∈ nil M , and

b 6∈ nil N , then (a, b) 6∼red (a′, b) on M × N , but a ∼red a′ on M and b ∼red b on N .

(2) Lemma 1.7.16(3) need not be true if I is inﬁnite. As a counterexample consider a family (Mn)n∈N
of binoids with an, bn ∈ Mn such that nan = nbn for all n ∈ N. Then an ∼tf bn on Mn but

(an)n∈N 6∼tf (bn)n∈N onQi∈I Mi.

In Section 2.1 and Section 4.2, we will encounter two more important congruences, namely the Rees
congruence ∼I of an ideal, and the congruence ∼bool that yields the booleanization of a binoid. The
next sections are devoted to important equivalences and congruences on the disjoint union and the
product of binoids.

1.8 Smash product

1.8 Smash product

35

Similar to monoid theory, we have shown in Section 1.1 that the product of a family of binoids is
again a binoid and that the direct sum coincides with the product if and only if the family is ﬁnite.
This and the next section is devoted to other constructions for binoids which have no counterpart in
the theory of monoids, but which yield particularly interesting binoid algebras.

As is well-known, the coproduct in the category of commutative monoids is the direct sum, whereas
the (ﬁnite) coproduct in the category of arbitrary monoids is given by the free monoid on the disjoint
union of the monoids modulo a particular equivalence relation that ensures the universal property,
cf. [5, Example 3.9]. The same phenomenon occurs when dealing with binoids. For this reason, we
only focus on the category of commutative binoids when determining the coproduct. Nonetheless, the
construction of the coproduct makes sense for arbitrary binoids (as the direct sum for monoids) and
for pointed sets in general, which we will call the smash product.2
Moreover, several examples show that the binoid algebra (over a ring R) of the smash product
of binoids yields the tensor product (over R) of the binoid algebras, which will be proved later in
Corollary 3.5.2. In the next section, when we introduce the analogue of modules and algebras for
binoids, namely N - sets and N - binoids, we will extend the deﬁnition of the smash product. For this,
we need to start here with pointed sets in general.

Deﬁnition 1.8.1. Let (Si, pi)i∈I be a family of pointed sets and denote by ∼∧ the relation onQi∈I Si

given by

(si)i∈I ∼∧ (ti)i∈I

:⇔ si = ti,∀i ∈ I ,

or

sk = pk, tℓ = pℓ

for some k, ℓ ∈ I .

Then the pointed set

class [(si)i∈I ] ∈Vi∈I Si for some (si)i∈I ∈Qi∈I Si will be denoted by ∧i∈I si.
element ∞i, the relation ∼∧ onQi∈I Mi identiﬁes all tuples with at least one entry equal to ∞i with
the absorbing element (∞i)i∈I = ∞Π and leaves the rest untouched.
Example 1.8.2. The binoid M = FC(x, y)/(3x = x, 2y = 0) is the smash product of (M ×)∞ and
Mpos, i.e. M ∼= (M ×)∞ ∧ Mpos. Moreover, for a ring K we get
K[M ] = K[X, Y ]/(X 3 − X, Y 2 − 1)

= K[X]/(X 3 − X) ⊗K K[Y ]/(Y 2 − 1)
= K[Mpos] ⊗K K[(M ×)∞] .

Lemma 1.8.3. Given a family (Mi)i∈I of binoids, the relation ∼∧ onQi∈I Mi is an ideal congruence
such that Vi∈I Mi is a binoid with identity element ∧i∈I 0i =: 0∧ and absorbing element ∧i∈I∞i =:

∞∧. Moreover, the canonical inclusions

ιk : Mk −→^i∈I

a 7−→ ∧i∈I ai ,

where ak = a and ai = 0 for i 6= k, are binoid homomorphisms.
Proof. All assertions are easily veriﬁed.

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Note that the smash product is the zero binoid if one binoid of the family is so, andVi∈I{0,∞} ∼=

{0,∞}. In general, one has M ∧ {0,∞} = M and M ∧ {∞} = {∞∧} for every binoid M . Thus,
{0,∞} is an ‘identity object’ and {∞} an ‘absorbing object’ in the category of binoids B with respect
to the smash product.

Example 1.8.4. If (Mi)i∈I is a ﬁnite family of nonzero binoids and Ai ⊆ Mi a generating set of Mi,

Remark 1.8.5. Let G be a binoid group and N a positive binoid. Then G∧ N is a binoid whose unit
group is G× and such that (G ∧ N )pos is isomorphic to N . In particular, there is an injective and a
surjective binoid homomorphism

(G×)∞ −→ G ∧ N −→ N
such that their composition is just the characterisic point χG×.

Example 1.8.6. Consider the binoid group G = (Z/2Z)∞ = FC(y)/(2y = 0) and the binoid N =
FC(x)/(3x = x). Their smash product is

G ∧ N = FC(x, y)/(3x = x, 2y = 0) .

Thus, G ∧ N is the binoid from Example 1.8.2. Now consider the binoid

˜M = FC(x, y)/(3x = x + y, 2y = 0) .

Both binoids, G ∧ N and ˜M , have the same unit group {0, y} ∼= Z/2Z and coincide as sets, more
precisely, one has G∧N = {∞, 0, x, y, x+y, 2x, 2x+y} = ˜M . Hence, (G∧N )pos = {[∞], [0], [x], 2[x]} =
N = ˜Mpos as binoids. Thus,

((G ∧ N )×)∞ × (G ∧ N )pos = ( ˜M ×)∞ × ˜Mpos .

However, G ∧ N 6∼= ˜M since 3a = a for all a ∈ G ∧ N , but 3(x + y) = x in ˜M . The corresponding
binoid algebras over a ring K

and

are not isomorphic either.

K[G ∧ N ] = K[X, Y ]/(X 3 − X, Y 2 − 1)

K[ ˜M ] = K[X, Y ]/(X 3 − Y X, Y 2 − 1)

instance, Lemma 1.7.16 for (5)-(7). The ﬁrst statement is obvious by Lemma 1.1.10. The statements
(2)-(4) are easily veriﬁed. See also Example 1.4.4(5).

Remark 1.8.9. As for the product, cf. Remark 1.7.17(1), there are no such results like (5)-(7) for
the congruence ∼red on the smash product. For instance, since [ei,∞] = [ej,∞] = ∞∧ in ∧i∈I Mi, one
has [ei,∞] ∼red [ej,∞] but 0 6∼red ∞ on every nonzero binoid.
The smash product is a universal object, namely, it is the (ﬁnite) coproduct in the category of
commutative binoids comB. This is contained in the following result.

Proposition 1.8.10. Let (Mi)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of binoids and N a commutative binoid. Every
family ϕi : Mi → N , i ∈ I, of binoid homomorphisms gives rise to a unique binoid homomorphism

ϕ : Vi∈I Mi → N such that ϕιk = ϕk, where ιk denotes the canonical embedding Mk ֒→ Vi∈I Mi,

well-deﬁned binoid homomorphism with ϕk = ϕιk for all k ∈ I.
Similar to the situation in the category of monoids, the induced map ϕ in the proof of Corollary

Proof. The canonical embeddings ιk : Mk → Vi∈I Mi, k ∈ I, with a 7→ abei induce by Proposition
1.5.6 a semigroup homomorphism N - specVi∈I Mi → N - spec Mk with ϕ 7→ ϕιk. By the universal

ψ : N - spec^i∈I

N - spec Mi

with ϕ 7→ (ϕιi)i∈I , which is surjective by Proposition 1.8.10. For the injectivity suppose that ϕ,

ϕ′ ∈ N - specVi∈I Mi with ϕιk = ϕ′ιk for all k ∈ I. Since every element ∧i∈I ai ∈ Vi∈I Mi can be
written asPi∈I aibei =Pi∈I ιi(ai), we get
ϕ(∧i∈I ai) =Xi∈I

ϕιi(ai) =Xi∈I

ϕ′ιi(ai) = ϕ′(∧i∈I ai) .

Hence, ϕ = ϕ′. For the supplement, one easily checks that ϕ as given in the statement is the preimage
of (ϕi)i∈I under ψ.

To determine the N - spectrum of the product of a family of nonzero binoids, we need the following
deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.8.13. The d i s j o i n t u n i o n of a family (Si)i∈I of arbitrary sets is given by the set

]i∈I

Si := {(s; i) | s ∈ Si, i ∈ I} .

with no non-trivial idempotents, then

where (ψ + ψ′)((ai)i∈J∪J ′ ) := ψ((ai)i∈J ) + ψ′((ai)i∈J ′ ), and

(ψ; J) + (ψ′; J ′) := (ψ + ψ′; J ∪ J ′) ,

where ((ψi)i∈J + (ψi)′

i∈J ′ )((ai)i∈J∪J ′ ) := (ψi(ai))i∈J + (ψ′

i(ai))i∈J ′ , respectively.

Proof. The latter semigroup isomorphism is an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.8.12 and given

by (ψ; J) 7→ ((ψιi)i∈J ; J), where ιi denotes the binoid embedding Mi ֒→Vj∈J Mj. To obtain the ﬁrst

isomorphism observe that for every J ⊆ I, J 6= ∅, the natural binoid epimorphism ππJ , where

with (ψ; J) 7→ ψππJ . It is easily checked that this is a semigroup homomorphism, where the disjoint
union is a semigroup as described in the proposition. We show that ϕ is a bijection. For this take an

arbitrary φ ∈ N - specQi∈I Mi and set

J := {i ∈ I | φ(ei,∞) = ∞} .

By Lemma 1.4.39(2) and the assumption on N , we obtain φ(ei,∞) ∈ bool(N ) = {0,∞}. Since

Pi∈I ei,∞ = ∞, we havePi∈I φ(ei,∞) = ∞ in N , which therefore implies that φ(ei,∞) = ∞ for at least
one i ∈ I. In particular, J 6= ∅. We claim that φ factors throughQi∈J Mi. For this, we may assume
that I = {1, . . . , n} and that J = {1, . . . , k}. Since 0 = φ(Pi6∈J ei,∞) (= φ(0, . . . , 0,∞, . . . ,∞)), we

obtain

φ(a1, . . . , an) = φ(cid:16)(a1, . . . , an) +Xi6∈J

ei,∞(cid:17) = φ(a1, . . . , ak,∞, . . . ,∞) ,

which shows that φ depends only on the J - components. Therefore, φ factors through the binoid
homomorphism

˜φ :Yi∈J

Mi −→ N ,

(a1, . . . , ak) 7−→ φ(a1, . . . , ak,∞, . . . ,∞) .

Hence, ˜φ factors through ∧i∈J Mi by Lemma 1.8.7. This shows the surjectivity of ϕ. The injectivity
is clear since J is uniquely determined by φ.

The condition on N containing only trivial idempotent elements is necessary in the preceding propo-
sition. Consider, for instance, the binoid M = FC(x1, x2)/(x1 + x2 = ∞, 2x1 = x1, 2x2 = x2). The
binoid homomorphism

N∞ × N∞ −→ M

with ei 7→ 0 and ei,∞ 7→ xi, i ∈ {1, 2}, does not factor through one of the factors.
Example 1.8.15. We apply Proposition 1.8.14 to determine the N - spectra of the products {0,∞}n

and (N∞)n, where N denotes a binoid with bool(N ) = {0,∞}. For this, recall that Vi∈I Mi =
(Qi∈I Mi)∞ if all Mi are integral, cf. Lemma 1.8.8(3), and let I = {1, . . . , n}. Since Vi∈I{0,∞} ∼=
{0,∞} and N - spec{0,∞} = {{0,∞} → N} ∼= {∞}, we get
N - spec{0,∞}n ∼= ]∅6=J⊆I

{∞} ,

as semigroups. Similarly, sinceVr

i=1 N∞ = (Nr)∞ for every r ≥ 1, we obtain

N - spec(N∞)n ∼= ]∅6=J⊆I

N - spec(N#J )∞ ∼= ]∅6=J⊆I

N #J

as semigroups, where the latter isomorphism is due to Lemma 1.5.7. In particular, for the dual of
{0,∞}n and (N∞)n, we get

({0,∞}n)v ∼= ]J⊆I

{∞} and ((N∞)n)v ∼= ]J⊆I

{0,∞}#J

1 Basic concepts of binoids

1.9 Pointed unions

In this section, we construct a binoid, called the bipointed union, from the disjoint union of a family
of (positive) binoids, which was introduced at the end of the last section. As a ﬁrst step, we deﬁne
the pointed union of a family of pointed sets.

Lemma 1.9.1. Given a family (Si, pi)i∈I of pointed sets, the relation ∼∞ on the disjoint union

Ui∈I Si that glues all points (pi; i), i ∈ I, together and leaves the rest untouched, i.e.

(s; i) ∼∞ (t; j)

:⇔ i = j and s = t

or a = pi and b = pj ,

deﬁnes an equivalence relation such that

is again a pointed set (S· i∈I Si, p), where p = [(pi; i)], i ∈ I.3 In particular, if (Mi)i∈I is a family of

binoids (or semibinoids), then the addition

deﬁnes a semibinoid structure onS· i∈I Mi.
Deﬁnition 1.9.2. Let (Si)i∈I be a family of pointed sets. The pointed set S· i∈I Si is called the
semibinoidS· i∈I Mi with addition given as in Lemma 1.9.1.
Note that S· i∈I Mi contains no integral elements. There are examples where the pointed union of

Remark 1.9.3. The disjoint union of a family (Mi)i∈I , #I ≥ 2, of binoids turns not into a monoid
by glueing together the identity elements using the same construction as in the lemma above with 0
instead of ∞ everywhere. In fact, the operation (a; i) + (b; j) := (a + b; i) if i = j and 0 := [(0; i)]
otherwise, is not associative since for i 6= j and a 6= 0i, one has ((a; i) + (b; i)) + (c; j) = 0 and
(a; i) + ((b; i) + (c; j)) = (a; i) 6= 0.

For the same reason, the semibinoidS· i∈I Mi turns not into a binoid by glueing the identity elements
(0; i), i ∈ I, together (so that 0 := [(0; i)] becomes the desired identity element) if at least one Mi is
not positive. To see this let 0i 6= a ∈ M ×
i and ∞j 6= b ∈ Mj, j 6= i. Then ((a; i)+(-a; i))+(b; j) = (b; j)
and (a; i) + ((-a; i) + (b; j)) = ∞; that is, the operation onS· i∈I Mi is not associative anymore.
There are other relations on the disjoint union of not necessarily positive binoids, where among other
identiﬁcations all identity elements are glued together as well as all absorbing elements, such that the
quotient is a binoid with respect to a certain addition diﬀerent from those considered in this section,
cf. Lemma 1.11.2.

equivalent to i = j and na = nb for some n ≥ 1 or a = b ∈ {0,∞}.

T (1;1) 7→ X and T (1;2) 7→ Y . The result for the smash product follows from Lemma 1.8.8 and the
theory of monoid rings since K[N∞ ∧ N∞] = K[(N × N)∞] = K(N × N) = KN ⊗K KN ∼= K[X, Y ].

1.10 Operations

This section deals with pointed sets and binoids on which a binoid N operates. These so-called N - sets
and N - binoids represent the binoid theoretic counterpart of modules and algebras over a ring. In
this spirit, we extend the deﬁnition of the smash product to N - sets and N - binoids.
In Section
3.4 and Section 3.5, we will discuss the associated modules and algebras of N - sets and N - binoids,
respectively.
A thorough investigation of N - sets and their modules can be found in [14, Section 2.2], where the
notion of ﬁnitely generated, noetherian, and projective N - sets has also been introduced and studied
in detail, while here we omit a treatment of the latter two.

Convention. In this section, N always denotes an arbitrary binoid.

Deﬁnition 1.10.1. A (left) o p e r a t i o n of N on a pointed set (S, p) is a map

+ : N × S −→ S ,

(a, s) 7−→ a + s ,

such that the following conditions are fulﬁlled.
(1) 0 + s = s for all s ∈ S.
(2) ∞ + s = p for all s ∈ S.
(3) a + p = p for all a ∈ N .
(4) (a + b) + s = a + (b + s) for all a, b ∈ N and s ∈ S.
Then S is called an N - s e t . An N - m a p is a pointed map ϕ : S → T of N - sets such that the
diagram

N × S

id ×ϕ

/ T

commutes; that is, ϕ(a + s) = a + ϕ(s) for all a ∈ N and s ∈ S. We say S is a f i n i t e l y g e n e r a t e d
N - set if there exists a ﬁnite subset T ⊆ S such that every s ∈ S can be written as s = a + t for some

a ∈ N and t ∈ T , i.e. S =St∈T (N + t). Then (S, p) is g e n e r a t e d as an N - set by T .

The addition M × M → M , (x, y) 7→ x + y, on a binoid M deﬁnes for every subbinoid N ⊆ M an
operation on M by restricting the ﬁrst component to N . In particular, M is an M - binoid. In general,
if S is an N - set and N ′ ⊆ N a subbinoid, then S is also an N ′ - set. The zero binoid operates only
on S = {p}, whereas the trivial binoid operates on every pointed set in the trivial way.
Remark 1.10.2. Property (3) of the deﬁnition of an N - set says that p is an invariant element under
the operation of N . Of course, p need not be unique with this property.
Arbitrary sets with an operation (also called action) of a semigroup or monoid S are usually called
S - acts. A thorough investigation of S - acts can be found in [36]. See also [45] for a treatment of the
associated modules. However, when it comes to study properties and results of ring and module theory
for S - acts, it is not uncommon to focus on S - acts that admit a unique invariant element and where
S contains an absorbing element, which resembles our setting of N - sets. In [2], for instance, S - acts
that satisfy some versions of Nakayama’s lemma and Krull’s (intersection) theorem are studied, which
do not translate directly from rings to binoids either, cf. Remark 2.1.26.
In general, there is a close connection between operations of an object as deﬁned above and its
representations, see the subsequent lemma. Taking up this point of view, S - acts are studied by
Cliﬀord and Preston in [15, Chapter 11] and called operands over S. Right from the beginning they
frequently point out that there is no loss of generality in dealing with acts that admit a unique invariant
element (centered operands) over a semigroup S with an absorbing element, which they do “almost
exclusively”.

Lemma 1.10.3. A pointed set (S, p) is an N - set if and only if there is a binoid homomorphism

N −→ (mapp S,◦, id, ϕ∞) ,

a 7−→ ϕa ,

where ϕa : S → S denotes the translation s 7→ a + s by a ∈ N .
Proof. This is easy to check.

An N∞ - set is by Lemma 1.10.3 the same as S together with a ﬁxed pointed map ϕ : S → S, the
operation being given by n + s = ϕn(s).

Lemma 1.10.4. The product, the direct sum, the smash product, and the pointed union of a family
of N - sets are again N - sets.

Proof. Let (Si, pi)i∈I be a family of N - sets. The operation of N onQi∈I Si is given by a + (si)i∈I =
(a + si)i∈I , which immediately yields the operation of N onLi∈I Si andVi∈I Si. The operation of
N onS· i∈I Si is given by a + (s; i) = (a + s; i).

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proof. Let I = {1, . . . , n}. It is clear that (VN Si, p∧N ) is a pointed set and that the map N×VN Si →
VN Si with (a,∧N si) 7→ (a + s1) ∧N s2 ∧N ··· ∧N sn is a well-deﬁned operation of N onVN Si. The

supplement follows from

= p1 ∧N (s2 + ∞) ∧N s3 ∧N ··· ∧N sn
= p1 ∧N p2 ∧N s3 ∧N ··· ∧N sn

and similar arguments.

Proposition 1.10.7. Let (Si)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of N - sets and T another N - set. Then we have
an isomorphism of N - sets:

T ∧N(cid:16)[·

Proof. The bijection is obviously given by t ∧N (s; i) ↔ (t ∧N s; i) with t ∈ T and s ∈ Si, i ∈ I.

Deﬁnition 1.10.8. Let (Si)i∈I be a family of N - sets and T another N - set. A pointed map ψ :

Qi∈I Si → T is called an N - multi map if

ψ(. . . , si−1, a + si, si+1, . . . ) = a + ψ(. . . , si−1, si, si+1, . . . )

for all a ∈ N and sk ∈ Sk, k ∈ I.
Remark 1.10.9. Note that ψ being an N - multi map implies the following two properties: for all
a ∈ N and sk ∈ Sk, k ∈ I, one has

ψ(. . . , a + si, . . . , sj, . . . ) = ψ(. . . , si, . . . , a + sj, . . . ) ,

and if one component of (si)i∈I equals the distinguished point, say sl = pl, then ψ((si)i∈I ) = ∞ since

ψ((si)i∈I ) = ψ(. . . , sl−1, pl, sl+1, . . .)

= ψ(. . . , sl−1, pl + ∞, sl+1, . . .)
= ∞ + ψ((si)i∈I )
= ∞ .

Proposition 1.10.10. Let (Si)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of N - sets and T another N - set. Every N - multi

map ψ : Qi∈I Si → T gives rise to a unique N - map ˜ψ : VN Si → T such that ˜ψπ = ψ, where π
denotes the canonical projecion Qi∈I Si →VN Si.
Proof. Let I = {1, . . . , n}. The map ˜ψ is a well-deﬁned binoid homomorphism by Remark 1.10.9. Its
uniqueness follows from ˜ψπ = ψ because π is surjective. Moreover, an easy computation

˜ψ(a + ∧N si) = ˜ψ((a + s1) ∧N s2 ∧N ··· ∧N sn)

= ψ(a + s1, s2, . . . , sn)

= a + ψ((si)i∈I )
= a + ˜ψ(∧N si)

proves that ˜ψ is an N - map.

Deﬁnition 1.10.11. Let M be a binoid. If ϕ : N → M is a binoid homomorphism with ϕ(a) + x =
x + ϕ(a) for all a ∈ N and x ∈ M , then M is called an N - b i n o i d with respect to the s t r u c t u r e
h o m o m o r p h i s m ϕ. An N - b i n o i d h o m o m o r p h i s m is a binoid homomorphism ψ : M → M ′
of N - binoids such that ψϕ = ϕ′, where ϕ and ϕ′ are the structure homomorphisms of M and M ′,
respectively. The set of all N - binoid homomorphisms M → M ′ will be denoted by homN (M, M ′).
N - binoids together with N - binoid homomorphisms form a category BN .
Let M be a commutative N - binoid via ϕ : N → M . We say that M is f i n i t e l y g e n e r a t e d
i=1 nixi for some

as N - binoid by x1, . . . , xr if every element f ∈ M can be written as f = ϕ(a) +Pr

a ∈ N and ni ∈ N, i ∈ {1, . . . , r}.
Every N - binoid M can be considered as an N - set in a natural way with respect to the operation
given by

+ : N × M −→ M ,

(a, x) 7−→ a + x := ϕ(a) + x .

Thus, an N - binoid is a binoid that is an N - set such that the operation of N is compatible with the
addition of the binoid. If ∼ is a congruence on an N - binoid M , then M/ ∼ is again an N - binoid
with respect to the structure homomorphism πϕ : N → M → M/ ∼.
Remark 1.10.12. A commutative N - binoid that is ﬁnitely generated as N - set is also ﬁnitely gen-
erated as N - binoid, but the converse need not be true. For instance, N∞ is ﬁnitely generated (by
the element 1) as {0,∞} - binoid but not as {0,∞} - set.
In general, a binoid M is ﬁnitely gener-
ated as {0,∞} - binoid if and only if it is ﬁnitely generated over every binoid N that admits a binoid
homomorphism ϕ : N → M . Equivalently, M is a ﬁnitely generated binoid.
Every commuative binoid M that is ﬁnitely generated as N - binoid by x1, . . . , xr gives rise to a

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Lemma 1.10.4 and the preceding observation.

Lemma 1.10.14. Let M, M ′, and L be N - binoids. Every N - binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → M ′

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Corollary 1.10.15. Given a ﬁnite family (Mi)i∈I of N - binoids, the equivalence relation ∼∧N

Vi∈I Mi is a congruence. In particular, the smash product of (Mi)i∈I over N is again an N - binoid

with identity element 0 ∧N ··· ∧N 0 =: 0∧N and absorbing element ∞ ∧N ··· ∧N ∞ =: ∞∧N . The
canonical inclusions

on

ιk : Mk −→^i∈I

N Mi ,

x 7−→ 0 ∧N ··· ∧N 0 ∧N x ∧N 0 ∧N ··· ∧N 0 ,

where x is the kth component, k ∈ I, are N - binoid homomorphisms.
Proof. This is easily veriﬁed.

Every binoid can be considered as a {0,∞} - binoid since {0,∞} is an initial object in the category
of binoids B. In this spirit, the smash product of a family of binoids from Section 1.8 is precisely the
smash product over {0,∞}. In particular, one cannot expect better or more results for the smash
product over an arbitrary binoid N than for the smash product (over {0,∞}) as listed in Lemma
1.8.8. In fact, all these results are diﬃcult to generalize to arbitrary N - binoids because the elements
of a class ∧N xi depend on the structure homomorphisms ϕi : N → Mi, i ∈ I, see for instance Lemma

Example 1.10.16. Let I be ﬁnite. If (Mi)i∈I is a family of N - binoids with generating sets Ai ⊆ Mi,

aj ∈ N , j ∈ J ⊆ I, where the summands ±ϕi(ai) are distributed in a way such that they vanish
after a suitable not necessarily unique shifting. Nevertheless, generators of the smash product yield

1.10.17 and Example 1.10.18 below. More precisely, ∧N ti = ∧N xi if ti = Pj∈J ±ϕi(aj) + xi with
generators of the smash product over N via the canonical projectionVi∈I Mi →VN Mi.
i ∈ I, thenVN Mi is generated by
where a ∈ Ai is the ith entry, i ∈ I. In particular, the smash productVN N∞ of the family (N∞)i∈I

abei,N := 0 ∧N ··· ∧N 0 ∧N a ∧N 0 ∧N ··· ∧N 0 ,
bei,N := 0 ∧N ··· ∧N 0 ∧N 1 ∧N 0 ∧N ··· ∧N 0 ,

is generated by

where 1 is the ith entry, i ∈ I.
Lemma 1.10.17. If M is an N - binoid, then N ∧N M ∼= M .
Proof. The natural operation N × M → M with (a, x) 7→ ϕ(a) + x, where ϕ : N → M denotes the
structure homomorphism of M , induces an N - binoid homomorphism N ∧N M → M with a ∧N x 7→
ϕ(a) + x. The inverse is obviously the N - binoid homomorphism M → N ∧N M , x 7→ 0 ∧N x.
The preceding result also shows that the smash product of N - binoids may have nice properties which
not all components need to fulﬁll. An easy example is given by

Z∞ ∧N∞ N∞ ∼= Z∞ ,

where all a ∧N∞ b 6= ∞∧ are units though both components need not be so.
Example 1.10.18. Consider the N∞ - binoid N∞ ∧N∞ N∞, where N∞ is considered as an N∞ - binoid
once (say on the left) via ϕk : 1 7→ k and once via ϕl : 1 7→ l for some k, l ≥ 1, which means

(a + k) ∧N∞ b = a ∧N∞ (b + l)

for all a, b ∈ N∞. In particular, nk ∧N∞ 0 = 0 ∧N∞ nl for n ≥ 1. For instance, N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ ∼= N∞ if
k = 0 or l = 0. Clearly, N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ is a positive N∞ - binoid. We claim that it is also cancellative.
For this note that each element a ∧N∞ b ∈ N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ can be written uniquely as a′ ∧N∞ b′, where

b′ is determined by b = b′ + ql with b′ < l, q ∈ N, and a′ = a + qk. In virtue of Lemma 1.4.24, it
suﬃces to show that the generators 1 ∧N∞ 0 and 0 ∧N∞ 1 are cancellative elements in N∞ ∧N∞ N∞. So
suppose that

(a ∧N∞ b) + (1 ∧N∞ 0) = (c ∧N∞ d) + (1 ∧N∞ 0) 6= ∞∧N∞

in N∞ ∧N∞ N∞, where a, b, c, d ∈ N. By the observation above, we may assume that b, d < l. Now
the equation (a + 1) ∧N∞ b = (c + 1) ∧N∞ d implies a + 1 = c + 1 and b = d, which shows that
a ∧N∞ b = c ∧N∞ d. The cancellativity of 0 ∧N∞ 1 follows similarly. In particular, 1 ∧N∞ 0 and 0 ∧N∞ 1
is the unique minimal generating set of N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ by Proposition 1.4.27.
In Section 1.12, we will show that N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ is torsion-free if and only if k and l are coprime, cf.
Lemma 1.12.16.

Corollary 1.10.20. Let (Mi)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of N - binoids and L another N - binoid. Every

from Proposition 1.10.10. Since

˜ψ(∧N xi + ∧N yi) = ˜ψ(π((xi + yi)i∈I ))

= ψ((xi + yi)i∈I )

= ψ((xi)i∈I ) + ψ((yi)i∈I )
= ˜ψ(∧N xi) + ˜ψ(∧N yi)
for all ∧N xi,∧N yi ∈VN Mi, the map ˜ψ is an N - binoid homomorphism.

The smash product over N is a universal object, namely, it is the (ﬁnite) coproduct in the category

Corollary 1.10.22. Let (Mi)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of N - binoids and L a commutative N - binoid.

homomorphism

is surjective.

Proof. The map ˜ψ :Qi∈I Mi → L with (xi)i∈I 7→Pi∈I ψi(xi) is an N - binoid homomorphism because

all ψi, i ∈ I, are so and L is commutative. If the structure homomorphisms are given by ϕ : N → L
and ϕi : N → Mi, i ∈ I, then ψkϕk(a) = ϕ(a) for all a ∈ N and k ∈ I, which yields

1.11 Direct and projective limits

In this section, the existence of the limit and colimit in the category of commutative N - binoids will be
proved. These can be described explicitly, but due to a lack of theory so far interesting examples for
so-called direct limits (limits) and projective limits (colimits) will be discussed in subsequent chapters.
Furthermore, we introduce the strong projective limit for which we also give an example.

Convention. In this section, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative.

Deﬁnition 1.11.1. Let (Mi)i∈I be a family of N - binoids and (I,≥) a d i r e c t e d s e t ; that is, I is
partially ordered with respect to ≥ and for all i, j ∈ I there is a k ∈ I with k ≥ i, j. Assume that for
every pair i, j ∈ I with i ≥ j, there is an N - binoid homomorphism ϕij : Mj → Mi such that
(1) ϕii = idMi for all i ∈ I.
(2) ϕkj = ϕkiϕij for all k ≥ i ≥ j.
Then (Mi, (ϕij )i≥j )i,j∈I is called a d i r e c t e d s y s t e m of N - binoids.

Lemma 1.11.2. If (Mi, (ϕij )i≥j )i,j∈I is a directed system of N - binoids, then

DI := (cid:16)]i∈I

Mi(cid:17).∼ ,

where ∼ denotes the equivalence relation on the disjoint union given by

(a; i) ∼ (b; j)

:⇔ ϕki(a) = ϕkj (b) for some k ≥ i, j ,

is an N - binoid with respect to the addition deﬁned by

[(a; i)] + [(b; j)] := [(ϕki(a) + ϕkj (b); k)] ,

for some k ≥ i, j. Moreover, there is a canonical N - binoid homomorphism ϕi : Mi → DI , a 7→ [(a; i)],
for every i ∈ I such that ϕi = ϕjϕji for all j ≥ i; in other words, the diagram

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proof. Only the transivity of ∼ is not trivial. If (a; i) ∼ (b; j) and (b; j) ∼ (c; r), there are k, l ∈ I
with k ≥ i, j and l ≥ j, r such that ϕki(a) = ϕkj (b) and ϕlj (b) = ϕlr(c). Since I is a directed set, we
have an s ∈ I with s ≥ k, l, which in particular satisﬁes s ≥ i, j, r. So we obtain

ϕsi(a) = ϕsk(ϕki(a)) = ϕsk(ϕkj (b)) = ϕsj (b) = ϕsl(ϕlj (b)) = ϕsl(ϕlr(c)) = ϕsr(c) .

Hence, (a; i) ∼ (c; r). To show that the addition on DI is well-deﬁned, we have to verify that

(ϕki(a) + ϕkj (b); k) ∼ (ϕli(a) + ϕlj (b); l)

whenever k ≥ i, j and l ≥ i, j. Again, we have an s ∈ I with s ≥ k, l, which in particular satisﬁes
s ≥ i, j. Therefore,

ϕsk(ϕki(a) + ϕkj (b)) = ϕsk(ϕki(a)) + ϕsk(ϕkj (b))

= ϕsi(a) + ϕsj (b)

= ϕsl(ϕli(a)) + ϕsl(ϕlj (b))

= ϕsl(ϕli(a) + ϕlj(b)) .

Since all ϕij, i ≥ j, are N - binoid homomorphisms, the identity elements (0; i) of the Mi are glued
together under ∼ and so are their absorbing elements (∞; i), i ∈ I. Their equivalence classes [(∞; i)]
and [(0; i)] serve as an absorbing and as an identity element of DI, respectively. The supplement is
clear.

The N - binoid DI together with the N - binoid homomorphisms ϕi : Mi → DI , i ∈ I, has the
following universal property.

Lemma 1.11.3. Let (Mi, (ϕij )i≥j)i,j∈I be a directed system of N - binoids and (DI , (ϕi)i∈I ) as in
Lemma 1.11.2. Given another N - binoid M ′ and a family ψi : Mi → M ′ of N - binoid homomorphisms
such that ψi = ψjϕji for all j ≥ i, there exists a unique N - binoid homomorphism ψ : DI → M ′ such
that the diagram

commutes for all j ≥ i.
Proof. It is immediately checked that the map ψ : DI → M ′ with ψ([(a; k)]) := ψk(a) is the unique
N - binoid homomorphism.

This universal property shows that DI is the c o l i m i t in the category of commutative N - binoids,

which one also calls the d i r e c t or i n d u c t i v e l i m i t and denotes it by lim−→ Mi, cf. [8, Chapter 2.6]

or [5, Chapter 5.6].

Remark 1.11.4. Though diﬀerently deﬁned our construction of lim−→ Mi coincides (of course) in case
N = {0,∞} with the one given in [14, Proposition 2.1]. Note, for instance, that (a; i) ∼ (ϕki(a); k)
for all k ≥ i because ϕli(a) = ϕlk(ϕki(a)) whenever l ≥ k.
An example of a directed system of N - binoids and its direct limit is given in Example 1.13.8.

ϕji : Mi → Mj such that
(1) ϕii = idMi for all i ∈ I.
(2) ϕjk = ϕjiϕik for all k ≥ i ≥ j.
Then (Mi, (ϕij )i≥j )i,j∈I is called an i n v e r s e s y s t e m of N - binoids.

PI := n(ai)i∈I ∈Yi∈I

Mi (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ϕji(ai) = aj for all i ≥ jo

In Lemma 2.3.14, we are able to describe Mred of a ﬁnitely generated binoid M by means of the

1.12 Finitely generated commutative binoids

Finitely generated binoids were introduced in Section 1.1. There, cf. Proposition 1.4.27, we could
show that a ﬁnitely generated commutative binoid M always admits a unique minimal generating
set, namely M+ \ 2M+, if it is positive and cancellative. Moreover, properties of a ﬁnitely generated
binoid usually only depend on the properties of the generators and the relations among them, which
is a ﬁnite data by R´edei’s Theorem if M is commutative, cf. Corollary 1.6.10. This makes ﬁnitely
generated commutative binoids comparatively easy to describe and study. They will provide us with
interesting examples especially when we study their associated algebras later. For this purpose, all
one- and, to a certain extent, two-generated commutative binoids with their binoid algebras will be
classiﬁed in this section.

Convention. In this section, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative and, if not otherwise
stated, K denotes a ring.

1.12 Finitely generated commutative binoids

55

From now on, generator will always mean binoid generator. For instance, Z∞ is a two-generated
binoid (group) with generators 1 and −1, none can be dropped and there is no generating set with less
than two elements. In general, M is an r-generated integral binoid if and only if M • is an r-generated
monoid. Basics on ﬁnitely generated commutative monoids can be found in [30, Chapter VI], [15,
§9.3], and in the monograph [48].
Recall, cf. Example 1.6.7, that a ﬁnitely generated binoid M with generators x1, . . . , xr is isomorphic
to (Nr)∞/∼ε, where

ε : (Nr)∞ −→ M with ε(ei) = xi ,

i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, is the canonical binoid epimorphism. Now by R´edei’s Theorem, cf. Corollary 1.6.10,
the congruence ∼ε can be generated by ﬁnitely many relations R : ε(a) = ε(b), a, b ∈ (Nr)∞. Thus,
M is given by ﬁnitely many generators and relations, which we denote by

FC(x1, . . . , xr)/(R1, . . . ,Rn) or

(Nr)∞/(R1, . . . ,Rn) .

Of course, what kind of relations occur for a speciﬁc binoid depends on the chosen generating set. In
general, M/(R1, . . . ,Rn) is the binoid that arises from the binoid M by taking the additional relations
R1, . . . ,Rn into account.
The binoid algebra of a ﬁnitely generated binoid FC(x1, . . . , xr)/(R1, . . . ,Rn) is K[X1, . . . , Xr]/I,
where I is an ideal generated by monomials and/or binomials depending on the relations R1, . . . ,Rn.
This observation suggests the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.12.1. With the notation from above, a relation on an r-generated binoid M of the form
R : ε(x) = ∞, x ∈ FCr, is called a m o n o m i a l r e l a t i o n . A b i n o m i a l r e l a t i o n is a relation of
the form R : ε(x) = ε(y) 6= ∞, x, y ∈ FCr. In addition, we say R is an u n m i x e d r e l a t i o n if it is
a monomial relation ε(x) = ∞ with # supp(x) = 1, x ∈ FCr, or a binomial relation ε(x) = ε(y) 6= ∞
such that supp(x) = supp(y) is a singleton, x, y ∈ FCr. Otherwise, R is a m i x e d r e l a t i o n .
The relation ε(x) = ε(y) = 0 is a binomial relation. A relation like ε(x) = ε(y) = ∞ will be
considered as two monomial relations, namely ε(x) = ∞ and ε(y) = ∞.
Remark 1.12.2. A congruence on a ﬁnitely generated binoid is an ideal congruence if and only if it
is generated by monomial relations.

Loosely speaking, a mixed relation is a relation where more than one generator is involved. We
sometimes indicate this by writing R(s) when s is the number of generators that appear. On one-
generated binoids there are no mixed relations. Precisely, one has three diﬀerent kinds of (unmixed)
relations which may appear, namely

1

: nx = 0 for some n ≥ 2,
: nx = ∞ for some n ≥ 2,
: rx = sx 6∈ {0,∞} for some 1 ≤ r < s,

R(1)
R(1)
R(1)
where x denotes the generator. Note that R(1)

2

3

and R(1)

2

are mutually exclusive (else hxi is the zero

binoid and not one-generated).
In this spirit, we say that there are no mixed r e l a t i o n s a m o n g a ﬁnite family of elements
yi ∈ M , i ∈ {1, . . . , s}, if the relations deﬁning the subbinoid generated by this family are unmixed.
For another description of this property consider the induced binoid homomorphism, cf. Proposition
1.8.10 (with Mi = hyii ֒→ M ),

Lemma 1.12.3. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated binoid and y1, . . . , yr ∈ M . The binoid homomorphism
ϕ :Vr
i=1 niyi, is surjective if and only if y1, . . . , yr generate M , and
injective if and only if there are no mixed relations among the elements yi, i ∈ I. In particular, if M is
ﬁnitely generated with no mixed relations among its generators y1, . . . , yr, then M ∼= hy1i ∧ ··· ∧ hyri.
Proof. The statement concerning the injectivity follows from the deﬁnition of a mixed relation. For
the surjectivity consider the following composition of binoid homomorphisms

i=1niyi) =Pr

i=1ψi : (Nr)∞ −→

with ψi : N∞ → hyii, 1 7→ yi, cf. Corollary 1.10.25 (with N = {0,∞}). Thus, ϕψ = ε : (Nr)∞ → M
with ei 7→ yi, i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, and ϕ is surjective if and only if ε is surjective. The supplement is
clear.

Since the smash product realizes the tensor product for the binoid algebras, cf. Corollary 3.5.2, we
have K[hx1i ∧ ··· ∧ hxri] = K[hx1i] ⊗K ··· ⊗K K[hxℓi].
In order to describe all ﬁnitely generated binoids that admit a generating set with no mixed relations
among the generators, it suﬃces by Lemma 1.12.3 to determine all one-generated binoids up to
isomorphism, what we want to do now.

Deﬁnition 1.12.4. Let M be a binoid. An element x ∈ M has a l o o p if nx = mx for some n 6= m.
Otherwise x is l o o p f r e e . In case x has a loop, there is a smallest integer s ≥ 1 such that rx = sx
for unique 0 ≤ r < s. Then r < s is called the i n i t i a l p a i r and s − r the l e n g t h of the loop.
If x ∈ M has a loop with inital pair r < s, then hxi ∼= N∞/(r = s).

Example 1.12.5.

(1) Nilpotent and idempotent elements, in particular absorbing and identity elements, have a loop
of length 1. The initial pair of an identity element 0 is 0 < 1 and that of an absorbing element
∞ (recall that 0∞ = 0 as this is the empty sum) and of all other idempotent elements 6= 0 is
1 < 2.

(2) A non-trivial unit u with nu = 0 for an n ≥ 2 that is minimal with respect to this relation
has a loop with initial pair 0 < n and length n. Moreover, the binoid group FC(u)/(nu = 0) ∼=
(Z/nZ)∞ is a loop, cf. the picture after Corollary 1.12.8 below. With the terminology of group
theory we may call u an element of order n.

(3) A cancellative nonunit is loopfree.

Recall that all boolean binoids are torsion-free, cf. Lemma 1.4.16(2). In particular, FC(x)/(2x = x)
(= {0, x,∞}) is torsion-free.
Lemma 1.12.6. Let M be a binoid and x ∈ M . If x has a loop of length ≥ 2 or a loop of length 1
with initial pair r + 1 > r ≥ 2, then x is a torsion element and, in particular, M is not torsion-free.
Proof. If r < s is the initial pair of the loop of x and k = s− r ≥ 2 its length, then nx = nx + kx for all
n ≥ r. So krx = krx + kx = k(r + 1)x but rx 6= (r + 1)x by assumption. Hence, x is a torsion element.
In the other case, if rx = (r + 1)x = ∞, there is nothing to show. So let rx = (r + 1)x 6= ∞ for r ≥ 2.
We claim that (r − 1)x is a torsion element. By assumption, we have inductively (r + n)x = rx for all
n ≥ 1. Hence, 2(r − 1)x = rx = 2rx but (r − 1)x 6= rx.

Proposition 1.12.7. Let M be a one-generated binoid with generator x.

(1) M is integral if and only if it is reduced (i.e. if x is not nilpotent).
(2) x is nilpotent if and only if M ∼= N∞/(n = ∞) for some n ≥ 2.
(3) x is a unit if and only if M ∼= (Z/nZ)∞ for some n ≥ 2.

(4) The following statements are equivalent if x is neither nilpotent nor a unit.

(a) x is a cancellative element.

(b) M is inﬁnite.

(c) x is loopfree.

If x 6= 2x, then this is also equivalent to

(d) M is torsion-free.
(e) M ∼= N∞.

Proof. (1)-(3) are clear. (4) The implications (c) ⇔ (b) ⇒ (a) are obvious and (a) ⇒ (c) follows from
Example 1.12.5(3). So let 2x 6= x. By Lemma 1.12.6, (d) implies (c). In particular, (d) implies (a)
and (b), which shows that M is regular by (1) and (2). The implication (d) ⇒ (e) therefore follows
from Corollary 1.4.28. Condition (e) implies everything.

Corollary 1.12.8. Up to isomorphism there are four diﬀerent types of one-generated binoids, namely

N∞ ,

(Z/nZ)∞ ,

N∞/(r = s) ,

and

N∞/(m = ∞)

with n, m ≥ 2 and 1 ≤ r < s. Their binoid algebras over K are

K[X] , K[X]/(X n − 1) , K[X]/(X s − X r) ,

and

K[X]/(X m) .

Proof. This is clear by Proposition 1.12.7.

These one-generated binoids can be illustrated as follows (the arrows indicate addition with the

If M is a ﬁnitely generated binoid with generators x1, . . . , xr, then every subbinoid hxki is isomorphic
to one of the above listed one-generated binoids, and if there are no mixed relations among the xi, then

then l, n ≥ 2 and vice versa.

Of course, more than one mixed relation may occur and also combinations, except the relations R(2)
and R(2)

2 which are mutually exclusive.

In the following, two-generated binoids with respect to the mixed relations above are studied in
detail. We start with the binoid groups.

Lemma 1.12.9. Let M be a two-generated binoid with generators x and y.
(1) M is a ﬁnite binoid group if and only if kx = 0 and ly = 0 for some k, l ≥ 2. In this case, k

and l can be chosen to be minimal with this condition.

(2) Let M be an inﬁnite binoid group.

(a) hxi ∩ hyi = {0,∞}.

1.12 Finitely generated commutative binoids

59

(b) There are n, m ≥ 1 minimal with respect to nx+ my = 0; that is, for any other pair r, s ≥ 1

with rx + sy = 0, one has r = ln and s = lm for some l ≥ 1.

(c) M is torsion-free if and only if gcd(n, m) = 1, where n, m ≥ 1 are minimal with respect to

nx + my = 0 (see (b)).

Proof. (1) M is a ﬁnite binoid group if and only if hxi and hyi are ﬁnite, which is in case x and y are
units, hence cancellative, equivalent to kx = 0 and ly = 0 for some k, l ≥ 2. The statement on the
minimality is obvious. (2) Let M be an inﬁnite binoid group with nx + my = 0 for some n, m ≥ 0 (a)
Suppose that rx = sy for r, s ≥ 2. Then

(sn + rm)x = snx + smy = s(nx + my) = 0

and similarly (sn + rm)y = 0, which obviously contradicts the assumption on M being inﬁnite. (b)
First observe that kx, ky 6= 0 for all k ≥ 2 by (a) because if, for instance, ky = 0 for some k ≥ 2, then
nx + my = 0 would imply nx = sy for some s ≥ 1 by adding y suﬃciently often to it. In particular,
n, m ≥ 1. Let n0 := min≤{n ∈ N | nx + my = 0 for some m ≥ 1} and let m0 ≥ 1 with n0x + m0y = 0.
Suppose that

nx + my = 0 (= n0x + m0y)

for another pair n, m ≥ 1. By the choice of n0, we have n ≥ n0. Since x is cancellative and kx, ky 6= 0
for all k ≥ 1, n = n0 is equivalent to m = m0. In particular, m0 is unique with n0x + m0y = 0.
The assumption m < m0 (and n ≥ n0) yields again a contradiction to hxi ∩ hyi = {0,∞}. Therefore,
n > n0 and m > m0. So one ﬁnds an l ≥ 1 such that

n = ln0 + r

and m = lm0 + s ,

with 0 ≤ r < n0 or 0 ≤ s < m0, which yields

0 = nx + my = l(n0x + m0y) + rx + sy = rx + sy .

By the choice of n0, the case 0 ≤ r < n0 yields r = 0, and hence s = 0. The other case, r ≥ n0 and
s < m0, is not possible as observed above. Hence, n = ln0 and m = lm0 for some l ≥ 1. (c) Let
n, m ≥ 1 be minimal with respect to nx + my = 0 as in (b). If gcd(n, m) = d > 1, then

d(n′x + m′y) = 0 = d · 0 ,

where n′ = n/d and m′ = m/d, but n′x + m′y 6= 0 by the minimality of n and m. This shows that M
is not torsion-free. For the converse, we need to prove that M • is a torsion-free group if gcd(n, m) = 1.
So assume that z = rx + sy ∈ M • with

0 = kz = krx + ksy

for some k ≥ 2. By (b), we get kr = ln and ks = lm for some l ∈ N. Since gcd(n, m) = 1, k divides l, so
we can write r = n(l/k) and s = m(l/k) with l/k ∈ N. Hence, z = rx + sy = (l/k)(nx + my) = 0.

Lemma 1.12.10. Let M be a two-generated binoid that admits a generating set {x, y} with no mixed
relation of the form R(2)
3 .

(1) If M is a ﬁnite binoid group, then M is isomorphic to

where k, l ≥ 2 are minimal with respect to kx = 0 = ly and gcd(k, l) ≥ 2.

(Z/kZ × Z/lZ)∞ ,

60

1 Basic concepts of binoids

(2) If M is an inﬁnite binoid group and n, m ≥ 1 minimal with respect to nx+ my = 0 (as in Lemma

1.12.9(2b)), then M is isomorphic to

Z∞ or

(Z × Z/dZ)∞ .

In the ﬁrst case, M is torsion-free with gcd(n, m) = 1, and in the latter M is not torsion-free
with gcd(n, m) = d ≥ 2.

Proof. (1) By Lemma 1.12.9, there are k, l ≥ 2 with kx = 0 = ly. If k and l are minimal with this
property, we obtain from Lemma 1.12.3

M ∼= hxi ∧ hyi ∼= (Z/kZ)∞ ∧ (Z/lZ)∞ ∼= (Z/kZ × Z/lZ)∞ .

If gcd(k, l) = 1, then M ∼= (Z/klZ)∞ is one-generated. Hence, gcd(k, l) ≥ 2.
(2) First consider the torsion-free case, which is the case when gcd(n, m) = 1 by Lemma 1.12.9. Thus,
lm + kn = 1 for some k, l ∈ Z. We may assume that k < 0 and l > 0 because the other case k > 0
and l < 0 follows by symmetry. By adding nm− mn = 0 to |k|n− lm = −1 as often as necessary, one
ﬁnds a k′ < 0 and an l′ > 0 with l′m + k′n = −1. With this, the homomorphism

is a well-deﬁned group epimorphism since

ϕ : M • −→ Z ,

x 7−→ m ,

y 7−→ −n ,

0 = nx + my 7−→ 0

lx + |k|y 7−→ lm + |k|y = 1
l′x + |k′|y 7−→ l′m + |k′|y = −1

The injectivity of ϕ follows from the fact that 0 = ϕ(ax + by) = am − bn is equivalent to a = sn and
b = sm for some s ∈ N, which gives ax + by = s(nx + my) = 0. Extending ϕ by ∞ 7→ ∞ now yields a
binoid isomorphism M ∼= Z∞.
Finally, assume that M is not torsion-free. By Lemma 1.12.9(2c), gcd(n, m) = d ≥ 2 so we can write
n = ˜nd and m = ˜md for ˜n, ˜m ≥ 1 with gcd(˜n, ˜m) = 1. The latter means 1 = s ˜m + r˜n for some r, s ∈ Z
with r < 0 and s > 0 or vice versa. By symmetry, we may assume that r < 0 and s > 0. The map

ψ : M • −→ Z × (Z/dZ) , ψ(ix + jy) = (i ˜m − j ˜n, ir + js mod d) ,

is a well-deﬁned group isomorphism. The surjectivity holds since

ψ(sx + (−r)y) = (1, 0) and ψ(˜nx + ˜my) = (0, 1) .

For the injectivity, assume that ψ(ix + jy) = (0, 0). Then

i = k˜n ,

j = k ˜m ,

and ir + js = k(˜nr + ˜ms) = k ≡ 0 mod d

where the latter implies ix + jy = 0. Therefore, we have shown that if M is a two-generated inﬁnite

binoid group that is not torsion-free, then M ∼= (Z × Z/dZ)∞ for some d ≥ 2.
Remark 1.12.11. The two-generated binoid group Z∞ is isomorphic to FC(x, y)/(x + y = 0). In
general, we have

FC(x1, . . . , xr)/(x1 + ··· + xr = 0) ∼= (Zr−1)∞ ,

where the isomorphism is given by xi 7→ ei when i 6= r, and xr 7→ −(e1 + ··· + er) otherwise.

1.12 Finitely generated commutative binoids

61

Proposition 1.12.12. A two-generated binoid is a binoid group if and only if it is isomorphic to

for d ≥ 2 or

Z∞ or

(Z × Z/dZ)∞

(Z/kZ × Z/lZ)∞

for k, l ≥ 2 with gcd(k, l) ≥ 2.
Proof. M is a two-generated binoid group if and only if M • is a two-generated (abelian) group. By
the structure theorem for ﬁnitely generated abelian groups, we know that

M • ∼= Zd × Z/n1Z × ··· × Z/nrZ

for some d ≥ 0 and n1, . . . , nr ≥ 2. By Lemma 1.12.10, the binoid groups listed in the proposition are
the only two-generated binoid groups of this kind, all other have strictly more or less generators.

The associated binoid algebras of the two-generated binoid groups are given by

K[Z∞] ∼= K[X, Y ]/(XY − 1) ,
K[(Z × Z/dZ)∞] ∼= K[X, Y ]/(X dY d − 1) ,

K[((Z/kZ) × (Z/lZ)∞] ∼= K[X, Y ]/(X k − 1, Y l − 1) ,

where d ≥ 2 and gcd(k, l) ≥ 2. The second result is deduced from the fact that (1, 1) and (−1, 0)
generate the binoid (Z × Z/dZ)∞, d ≥ 2, since

d(1, 1) + (d − 1)(−1, 0) = (1, 0) and (1, 1) + (−1, 0) = (0, 1) .

Hence, K[X, Y ] → K(Z× Z/dZ) with X 7→ T (1,1) and Y 7→ T (−1,0) is an epimorphism of K - algebras
with kernel generated by X dY d − 1. The other identiﬁcations are obvious.
The two-generated ﬁnite binoid groups with one mixed relation of the form R(2)

3 have a very nice

description in the terminology of binoids.

Proposition 1.12.13. If M is a two-generated ﬁnite binoid group that admits generators with a

relation of the from R(2)

3 , then M is isomophic to

(Z/kZ)∞ ∧N∞ (Z/lZ)∞

for some k, l ∈ N with gcd(k, l) ≥ 2, where (Z/kZ)∞ is a Z∞ - binoid via ϕr : 1 7→ r and (Z/lZ)∞ is
a Z∞ - binoid via ϕs : 1 7→ s for some 2 ≤ r < k and 2 ≤ s < l.
Proof. First note that on a ﬁnite two-generated binoid group with generators x, y ∈ M a relation of
the from

R(2)

3

: nx + my = px + qy 6∈ {0,∞}

is always equivalent to rx = sy 6∈ {0,∞} for certain r, s ≥ 2, which is a specialization of R(2)
3 . More
precisely, if k, l ≥ 2 are minimal with respect to kx = 0 and ly = 0, cf. Lemma 1.12.10(1), we may
assume that 0 ≤ n, p ≤ k and 0 ≤ m, q ≤ l. Then R(2)
is equivalent to rx = sy 6∈ {0,∞}, where
r ≡ n + k − p mod k and s ≡ q + l − m mod l.
In particular, instead of an arbitrary ﬁnite two-generated binoid group with one mixed relation of
the form R(2)

3 , it suﬃces to consider

j ∈ {k, l}, of the canonical embedding (on the respective component) and the canonical projection.
Hence, there is by Corollary 1.10.22 a unique binoid homomorphism

ψ : (Z/kZ)∞ ∧N∞ (Z/lZ)∞ −→ M

with ιjψ = ψj, j ∈ {k, l}, which is surjective since ψ(1 ∧N∞ 0) = x and ψ(0 ∧N∞ 1) = y. On the other
hand, there is a {0,∞} - binoid homomorphism

ϕ : (Z/kZ)∞ ∧ (Z/lZ)∞ −→ (Z/kZ)∞ ∧N∞ (Z/lZ)∞

by Corollary 1.10.22, which factors through M because ϕ(r ∧ 0) = r ∧N∞ 0 = 0∧N∞ s = ϕ(0∧ s). This
factorization and ψ are inverse to each other. Hence, M ∼= (Z/kZ)∞ ∧N∞ (Z/lZ)∞.

A two-generated (ﬁnite) binoid group as in Proposition 1.12.13 with kx = ly = 0, gcd(k, l) ≥ 2, and
only one more generating relation of the form rx = sy with r < k and s < l, can be displayed in the
following way (here r divides k and s divides l):

The situation, where kx = ly (possibly ∈ {0,∞}) with l, k ≥ 2 is the only generating relation, can
be visualized in the following way:

Now we consider the case where a mixed relation of this type is given.

Lemma 1.12.14. Let M be a two-generated binoid that admits generators x and y such that kx = ly
for some l, k ≥ 2.
(1) x is loopfree if and only if y is so.

(2) The following statements are equivalent.

(a) M is integral

(b) M is reduced

(c) x and y are not nilpotent.

(3) There is a surjective binoid homomorphism φ : hxi ∧N∞ hyi → M , where hxi and hyi are consid-
ered as N∞ - binoids via ϕk : 1 7→ kx and ϕl : 1 7→ ly, respectively, which is an isomorphism if
kx = ly is the only mixed generating relation.

Proof. (1) and (2) follow from easy computations. (3) By assumption, we have a commutative diagram

which gives rise to a binoid homomorphism φ : hxi ∧N∞ hyi → M by Corollary 1.10.22. φ is surjective
because x and y generate M . If kx = ly is the only mixed generating relation, then

M ∼= (N2)∞/(R, ke1 = le2) ,

where R is a (maybe empty) set of unmixed relations, i.e. relations that involve only one of the
generators, e1 or e2. By Lemma 1.3.10, there is a unique binoid homomorphism

e1 7−→ x ∧N∞ 0 ,
which respects the deﬁning relations of M as listed above since

ψ : (N2)∞ −→ hxi ∧N∞ hyi ,

e2 7−→ 0 ∧N∞ y ,

ψ(ke1) = (kx) ∧N∞ 0 = 0 ∧N∞ (ly) = ψ(le2) .

Hence, there is a binoid homomorphism ˜ψ : M → hxi ∧N∞ hyi by Lemma 1.6.3. The homomorphisms
φ and ˜ψ are inverse to each other.

By the preceding lemma, a two-generated binoid with generating set {x, y} and R : kx = ly, l, k ≥ 2
being the only mixed generating relation, is given by the N∞ - binoid hxi ∧N∞ hyi described as in the
lemma. In this situation, the subbinoids hxi and hyi are isomorphic to N∞, N∞/(n = ∞), (Z/n)∞,

❀ K[X, Y ]/(X k − Y l)

where 1 ≤ p < k and 1 ≤ q < l and 1 ≤ r < s < k and 1 ≤ m < n < l. The ﬁrst identiy follows with
K[N∞] ⊗K[N∞] K[N∞] ∼= K[X] ⊗K[Z] K[Y ], where X k = Z = Y l, and the latter two from the ﬁrst.
Remark 1.12.15. The K - spectrum of N∞∧N∞ N∞, K a ﬁeld, is given by K- Spec K[X, Y ]/(X k−Y l),
which is for k = 3, l = 2 and K = R precisely,

Neil’s parabola.

In the last section, cf. Example 1.10.18, we have already shown that N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ is a positive
and cancellative N∞ - binoid that admits a unique minimal generating set consisting of the elements
1 ∧N∞ 0 and 0 ∧N∞ 1.
The same holds true for the latter two N∞ - binoids in the list above since they are isomorphic to
(N∞ ∧N∞ N∞)/(Ri, i ∈ I), where the respective additional relations Ri do not aﬀect these properties.
Obviously, N∞/(p = ∞)∧N∞ N∞/(q = ∞) is not reduced as p(1∧N∞ 0) = ∞∧, hence not torsion-free.
By Lemma 1.12.6, the binoid N∞/(r = s)∧N∞ N∞/(m = n) is not torsion-free if s−r ≥ 2 or n−m ≥ 2.
The remaining case r = m = 1 and s = n = 2 (the boolean case) is excluded as the mixed relation
would enforce x = y. As announced in the last section, we will now determine when N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ is
torsion-free.

Lemma 1.12.16. Consider the N∞ - binoid N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ from above (see also Example 1.10.18). The
N∞ - binoid homomorphism

ψ : N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ −→ N∞ with n ∧N∞ m 7−→

nl + mk
gcd(k, l)

is injective if and only if gcd(k, l) = 1. In particular, N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ is torsion-free (and a subbinoid of
N∞) if and only if k and l are coprime.

Proof. Recall that ψ is the well-deﬁned N∞ - binoid homomorphism induced by the N∞ - binoid ho-
momorphisms N∞ → N∞, 1 7→ l/ gcd(k, l), when the codomain is the N∞ - binoid via 1 7→ k, and
1 7→ k/ gcd(k, l) if the codomain is the N∞ - binoid via 1 7→ l, cf. Example 1.10.23.

1.12 Finitely generated commutative binoids

65

Suppose that gcd(k, l) = d > 1. Then k = k′d and l = l′d for some 1 ≤ k′ < k and 1 ≤ l′ < l.
Therefore, we obtain in N∞ ∧N∞ N∞,

d(k′ ∧N∞ 0) = k ∧N∞ 0 = 0 ∧N∞ l = d(0 ∧N∞ l′)

but k′ ∧N∞ 0 6= 0 ∧N∞ l′. This shows that N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ is not torsion-free, in particular, ψ is not
injective. For the converse let k and l be coprime and

ψ(n ∧N∞ m) = nl + mk = rl + sk = ψ(r ∧N∞ s)

with, say, n ≥ r. Then 0 ≤ (n − r)l = (s − m)k which implies (n − r) = ck and (s − m) = cl for some
c > 0 because gcd(k, l) = 1. So we have n = r + ck and s = m + cl, which yields

n ∧N∞ m = (r + ck) ∧N∞ m = r ∧N∞ (m + cl) = r ∧N∞ s

in N∞ ∧N∞ N∞. Hence, ψ is injective if gcd(k, l) = 1, which means that N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ is a subbinoid
of N∞ in this case and, in particular, torsion-free.

Proposition 1.12.17. If M is a two-generated binoid with generating set {x, y}, then M is isomorphic
to N∞ ∧N∞ N∞, where N∞ is considered as an N∞ - binoid once via 1 7→ k and once via 1 7→ l for
some k, l ≥ 2, if and only if M is a cancellative and positive binoid with hxi ∩ hyi 6= {0,∞}.
Proof. By Example 1.10.18, the binoid N∞ ∧N∞ N∞ described in the proposition is positive and
cancellative with unique minimal generating set 1∧N∞ 0 and 0∧N∞ 1. Hence, if M ∼= N∞ ∧N∞ N∞, the
isormophism is given by x ↔ 1∧N∞ 0 and y ↔ 0∧N∞ 1 or vice versa, which implies hxi∩hyi 6= {0,∞}
since k ∧N∞ 0 = 0 ∧N∞ l if the structure homomorphism of N∞ is given by 1 7→ k in the left entry and
by 1 7→ l in the right entry.
For the converse note that x and y is the unique minimal generating set of M because M is positive
and cancellative, cf. Proposition 1.4.27. Furthermore, M is cancellative and positive if and only if x
and y are cancellative nonunits, cf. Lemma 1.4.24. By assumption, there exsits a k ≥ 2 minimal with
respect to kx = ly 6= ∞ for some l ≥ 2. Then l is unique since the subbinoid hyi generated by the
cancellative nonunit y is loopfree by Proposition 1.12.7. To see that l is also minimal with respect to
ly ∈ hxi assume that nx = my with m < l. Then mkx = mly = lnx, where ln > km ≥ 2 because
n > k and l > m, which yields a non-trivial equation 0 = (ln − km)x by the cancellativity of x and
therefore a contradiction to x 6∈ M ×. In particular, hxi∩hyi = hlxi = hkyi and M → N∞∧N∞ N∞ with
x 7→ 1 ∧N∞ 0 and y 7→ 0 ∧N∞ 1 is a well-deﬁned binoid isomorphism because there are by assumption
no other generating relations on M than R : kx = ly
Now we consider the special case of R(2)
Proposition 1.12.18. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated binoid with minimal generating set {xi | i ∈ I}.
If xi + xj = ∞ for all i 6= j, then M is isomorphic to

In particular, if hxii ∩ hxji = {0,∞} for all i 6= j, then M is isomorphic to the bipointed union of

Proof. The property xi + xj = ∞ for all i 6= j implies the positivity of M . Let Mk ⊆ M be as deﬁned
in the proposition. If y ∈ Mk and z ∈ Mk′ , k 6= k′, with y, z 6= 0, then y + z = ∞ by the construction

The injectivity follows from the injectivity of the embeddings Mk ֒→ M and the fact that Mk ∩ Mk′ =

For the description of Mk when #Ik ≥ 2, we may treat the Mk separately. So assume that hxii∩hxji 6=

nixi 6= ∞ and (ni + 1)xi = ∞, hence it is in particular independent of j. Therefore, we get by Lemma
1.6.3 a surjective factorization

1.12 Finitely generated commutative binoids

67

We close this section with a general study of properties of two-generated binoids.

Proposition 1.12.19. Let M be a two-generated binoid with generating set {x, y}.
(1) If M is not cancellative but contains a non-trivial cancellative element, then M is integral if and
only if one generator, say x, is regular and the other generator, y, is not nilpotent. In this case,
(a) can(M )∞ = hxi.
(b) M is torsion-free if and only if ky is no torsion element for all k ≥ 1.
(c) M is ﬁnite if and only if M × = hxi• and ny = my 6= ∞ for some n, m ≥ 1. In this

situation, hxi ∩ hyi = {0,∞}.

(2) If M is ﬁnite with no non-trivial cancellative elements, then x and y have a loop. If the initial

pairs are 1 ≤ n < m and 1 ≤ r < s, then
(a) M is reduced if and only if M is isomorphic to

N∞/(r = s)[: N∞/(n = m)

or nx + ry 6= ∞.

(b) M is integral if and only if nx + ry 6= ∞.
(c) M is torsion-free if and only if M is boolean.

Proof. (1) By assumption, there is a cancellative element rx + sy 6= 0, r, s ∈ N. We may assume that
r 6= 0, the case s 6= 0 follows similarly. The implication ⇐ is clear because every equation rx+sy = ∞,
r, s ∈ N, implies sy = ∞ since x is integral, a contradiction to y not nilpotent. So let M be integral.
Then every equation x + a = x + b 6= ∞, a, b ∈ M , implies rx + sy + a = rx + sy + b 6= ∞, and
hence a = b by the cancellativity of rx + sy. Therefore, x is cancellative and s = 0 because M is not
cancellative, cf. Lemma 1.4.24. In particular, can(M )∞ = hxi, which proves (a). Since M is integral,
x is a regular element and y not nilpotent.
(b) The implication ⇒ is trivial. So let ky be no torsion element for all k ≥ 1 and suppose that
n(rx + sy) = n(lx + ky) for some r, s, l, k ∈ N and n ≥ 2. We may assume that r ≥ l. By the
cancellativity of x, we deduce from this equation that n((r− l)x+ sy) = nky. Hence, (r− l)x+ sy = ky
since ky is no torsion element. Adding lx gives the desired equality rx + sy = lx + ky. (c) is clear since
M is ﬁnite if and only if the subbinoids hxi and hyi are ﬁnite. For the supplement note that sy = rx
implies y ∈ M ×, which yields a contradiction to M being not cancellative. Hence, hxi∩hyi = {0,∞}.
(2) Clearly, x and y have a loop if M is ﬁnite. If 1 ≤ n < m and 1 ≤ r < s are the initial pairs, then
every a ∈ M • can be written as a = ix + jy with 0 ≤ i < m and 0 ≤ j < s.
(a) First let M be reduced. Obviously, x and y are not nilpotent. In case x + y = ∞, there is no
other generating relation on x and/or y possible, so we obtain M ∼= N∞/(r = s)S: N∞/(n = m). If

x + y 6= ∞ and k := max(r, n), then ∞ 6= k(x + y) = nx + ry + b for some b ∈ M . In particular,
nx + ry 6= ∞. Conversely, if M is isomorphic to the given bipointed union, then M is reduced. So
assume that nx + ry 6= ∞. Note that this implies that x and y are not nilpotent (otherwise the loops
were given by nx = ∞ and ry = ∞). If ka = ∞ for some k ≥ 2 and ∞ 6= a = ix + jy ∈ M with
1 ≤ i < m and 1 ≤ j < s, then ∞ = ka = kix + kjy = i′x + j′y, where 1 ≤ i′ ≤ m and 1 ≤ j′ ≤ s.
Hence,

∞ = ka + (m − i′)x + (s − j′)y = mx + sy = nx + ry ,

which contradicts our assumption. (b) The implication ⇒ is trivial. So assume that nx + ry 6= ∞. If
M is not integral, there is an equation ix + jy = ∞, and by assumption n ≤ i < m and r ≤ j < s
such that (i, j) 6= (n, r). Again we get a contradiction by ∞ = ix + jy + (m− i)x + (s− j)y = nx + ry.
(c) The implication ⇐ follows from Lemma 1.4.16(2). Conversely, if M is not boolean, then s− r ≥ 2
or m − n ≥ 2, which implies that x or y is a torsion element by Lemma 1.12.6.

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Example 1.12.20. Let l ≥ 2. The binoid

M := FC(x, y)/(y = y + lx)

is obviously positive and integral, but not cancellative because y is a non-cancellative element. On the
other hand, x is a cancellative element. For this note that the relation y = y +lx implies sy = sy +mlx
for all s, m ≥ 1. In particular, every element f = rx + sy ∈ M with s ≥ 1 can be written uniquely as
r′x + s′y with r′ < l. Since hxi ∼= N∞ ∼= hyi, we only need to consider an equation like

nx + my = rx with r, n, m ≥ 1

and 1 ≤ n < l .

Write r = r′ + kl with r′ < l and k ≥ 0. Adding y to the equation yields

nx + (m + 1)y = rx + y = r′x + klx + y = r′x + y ,

which implies n = r′ and m = 0. Hence, n = r since hxi ∼= N∞. M is also not torsion-free because
l(x + y) = lx + ly = ly but y + x 6= y. The element y is a so-called unseparated element in M and
its existence turns M (in this case) in an unseparated binoid. Unseparatedness will be discussed in
Section 5.1 in more detail.

Example 1.12.21. The binoid

M := FC(x, y)/(2x = ∞, x + y = x, 2y = y)

is positive, not reduced (hence not integral), and contains no non-trivial cancellative element because
both generators x and y are not cancellative and M = {0,∞, x, y}.
At the end of Section 1.14, we are able to describe ﬁnitely generated binoids that are regular or
regular and positive in detail, cf. Proposition 1.14.6.

1.13 Localization

We want to introduce the concept of localization to binoids since this is a very powerful tool and
frequently used in commutative algebra with which we will be concerned while passing to the algebra
of a binoid. Due to the fact that localization itself is a problem in non-commutative algebra we make
the following agreement.

Convention. In this section, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative.

Deﬁnition 1.13.1. Let M be a binoid and S a submonoid of M . We deﬁne an equivalence relation
on M × S as follows: for all a, a′ ∈ M and s, s′ ∈ S deﬁne

(a, s) ∼ (a′, s′)

:⇔ ∃c ∈ S : a + s′ + c = a′ + s + c .

The equivalence class of (a, s) will be denoted by a-s. The set of all equivalence classes

MS := {a-s | a ∈ M, s ∈ S}

is the l o c a l i z a t i o n of M at S. The localization at a submonoid that is generated by a single
element f ∈ M will be abreviated by Mf .

1.13 Localization

69

Lemma 1.13.2. Let M be a binoid and S a submonoid of M . The addition

(a-s) + (a′-s′) := (a + a′)-(s + s′)

deﬁnes a binoid structure on MS such that ιS : M −→ MS, a 7−→ a-0, is a binoid homomorphism,
where the elements of S become units and ker ιS = {a ∈ M | ∃b ∈ S : a + b = ∞} ⊆ intc(M ), which
turns MS in an M - binoid.

Proof. It is immediate to check that the operation is well-deﬁned and that the map is a homomorphism.
If s ∈ S, then (s-0) + (0-s) = s-s ∼ 0-0. Hence, s-0 ∈ M ×
S .
By the preceding lemma, one has MS = MS+M ×. Moreover, MS = M if and only if S ⊆ M ×, and
MS = {∞} if and only if ∞ ∈ S.
Proposition 1.13.3. Given a binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N and a submonoid S ⊆ M with
ϕ(S) ⊆ N ×, there is a unique M - binoid homomorphism ϕS : MS → N such that the diagram

N

ϕ

=④④④④④④④④

ϕS

M

ιS

MS

commutes.
Proof. Deﬁne ϕS(a-s) := ϕ(a) + -ϕ(s) for a ∈ M and s ∈ S, which is possible since ϕ(s) ∈ N ×
by assumption. To show that this is well-deﬁned let a-s = b-t for a, b ∈ M and s, t ∈ S. Then
a + t + c = b + s + c for some c ∈ S, which implies that ϕ(a) + ϕ(t) + ϕ(c) = ϕ(b) + ϕ(s) + ϕ(c).
Since ϕ(S) ⊆ N ×, this is equivalent to ϕ(a) + -ϕ(s) = ϕ(b) + -ϕ(t). Hence, ϕS does not depend
on the chosen representatives. It is an M - binoid homomorphism since ϕ is a binoid homomorphism
and ϕS(a-0) = ϕ(a) + -ϕ(0) = ϕ(a). The uniqueness follows since the commutativity of the diagram
requires ϕS(a-0) = ϕ(a) and ϕS(0-a) = -ϕ(a) for s ∈ S.
The universal property of the localization has the following consequences.

Corollary 1.13.4. Let M and N be binoids. If S ⊆ M is a submonoid, then

N - spec MS ∼= {ϕ ∈ N - spec M | ϕ(S) ⊆ N ×}

as semigroups.

Proof. By Proposition 1.5.6, the canonical binoid homomorphism ιS : M → MS induces a semigroup
homomorphism ι∗
S : N - spec MS → N - spec M with ϕ 7→ ϕιS such that ϕιS(S) ⊆ N ×. By Proposition
1.13.3, ι∗
Corollary 1.13.5. If S is a submonoid of M , then MS ∼= MFilt(S) as M - binoids. In particular, the
localizations at the submonoids S and T of M are isomorphic as M - binoids if Filt(S) = Filt(T ).

S is an isomorphism.

Proof. Consider the canonical binoid homomorphisms ιS : M → MS and ι : M → MFilt(S). Since
S ⊆ Filt(S), one has ι(S) ⊆ M ×
Filt(S). On the other hand, if t ∈ Filt(S), say t + u = s ∈ S for u ∈ M ,
then

(t-0) + (u-s) = (t + u)-s = 0-0

with u-s ∈ MS. Hence, ιS(t) = t-0 ∈ M ×
S for all t ∈ Filt(S). Thus, ιS and ι satisfy the assumptions
of Proposition 1.13.3. So we obtain unique M - binoid homomorphisms MS → MFilt(S), a-s 7→ ι(a) +
-ι(s) = a-s, and MFilt(S) → MS, a-s 7→ ιS(a) + -ιS(s) = a-s, which are obviously inverse to each other.
The supplement follows from the ﬁrst part.

1 Basic concepts of binoids

By the preceding result, the set of all localizations of a binoid M is given by {MF | F ∈ F (M )} =:
MF (M). The operation

for F, G ∈ F (M ), turns MF (M) into a binoid

MF ◦ MG := MF ∩G ,

MF (M),◦ := (MF (M),◦, MM , MM ×) ,

where MM = {∞} and MM × = M .
Corollary 1.13.6. The canonical maps F ↔ MF are order preserving binoid isomorphisms between
F (M )∩ and MF (M),◦.
Proof. Only the injectivity of F 7→ MF is not obvious, but this follows from Corollary 1.13.5.
Corollary 1.13.7. If M is ﬁnitely generated, then so is MS for every submonoid S ⊆ M .
Proof. Let I be ﬁnite and {xi | i ∈ I} a generating set of M . By Corollary 1.13.5, we may assume that
S is a ﬁlter. Therefore, S is the submonoid generated by (xj )j∈J for some subset J ⊆ I. If a-s ∈ MS,

where a =Pi∈I nixi and s =Pj∈J mjxj with ni, mj ∈ N, i ∈ I, j ∈ J, then

a-s = (cid:16)Xi∈I

ni(xi-0)(cid:17) +(cid:16)Xj∈J

mj(0-xj)(cid:17) .

This shows that (xi-0)i∈I and (0-xj)j∈J generate MS.

Example 1.13.8. Let S be a submonoid of the binoid M and consider S′ := S/ ∼, where f ∼ g if
Filt(f ) = Filt(g). By abuse of notation, we omit the brackets and write f instead of [f ] for an element
of S′. Deﬁne a partial order on S′ by

and denote by

f ≥ g for f, g ∈ S′

:⇔ Filt(g) ⊆ Filt(f )

ϕf g : Mg → Mf ,

a-s 7−→ a-s ,

the canonical M - binoid homomorphism for f ≥ g. Note that ϕf 0 : M → Mf (i.e. f ≥ 0) for all
f ∈ S′, and since f + g ∈ S′ for every f, g ∈ S′, we have f + g ≥ f, g. Thus, (Mf , ϕf g)f ≥g is a directed
system of M - binoids and

lim−→ Mf = ]f ∈S′

Mf.∼ ,

where (a-s; f ) ∼ (b-t; g) :⇔ ϕhf (a-s) = ϕhg(b-t) for some h ∈ S′ with h ≥ f, g, together with the
canonical M - binoid homomorphisms

ϕg : Mg → lim−→ Mf ,

a-s 7→ [(a-s; g)] ,

g ∈ S′, is the direct limit of this system, cf. Section 1.11. Since ψf : Mf → MS with a-s 7→ a-s
is an M - binoid homomorphism for every f ∈ S′ such that ψg = ψf ϕf g if f ≥ g, there is a unique
M - binoid homomorphism ψ : lim−→ Mf → MS with ψϕg = ψg, g ∈ S′, cf. Lemma 1.11.3. On the other
hand, for g ∈ S one has ϕ0(g) = [(g-0; g)] ∈ (lim−→ Mf )× because

[(g-0; g)] + [(0-g; g)] = [(ϕgg(g-0) + ϕgg(0-g)); g] = [(0-0; g)] = 0 .

Hence, S ⊆ (lim−→ Mf )×. By Proposition 1.13.3, we therefore have a unique M - binoid homomorphism

1.13 Localization

ϕ : MS → lim−→ Mf with ϕιS = ϕ0. Thus, for every g ∈ S′ there is a commutative diagram

/ MS .

From this we deduce for a-s ∈ Mg,

(ϕψ)([(a-s; g)]) = ϕ(ψ(ϕg(a-s))) = ϕ(ψg(a-s)) = ϕg(a-s) = [(a-s; g)]

and

(ψϕ)(a-s) = ψ(ϕ(ψg(a-s)) = ψ(ϕg(a-s)) = ψg(a-s) = a-s .

This shows that ψ and ϕ are inverse to each other. Hence, lim−→ Mf ∼= MS as M - binoids.
To describe the smash product (over M ) of two localizations of M recall the binoid structure on
F (M ) given by F ⋆ G := Filt(F + G) for F, G ∈ F (M ), in which M × serves as the identity element
and M as the absorbing element.

Proposition 1.13.9. Let F, G ∈ F (M ). Then

MF ∧M MG = MF ⋆G ,

where the localizations are M - binoids via the canonical binoid homomorphisms ιF : M → MF and
ιG : M → MG, both given by x → x-0. In particular, the canonical maps F ↔ MF are order preserving
binoid isomorphisms between F (M )⋆ = (F (M ), ⋆, M ×, M ) and (MF (M),∧, M,{∞}).
Proof. By Corollary 1.10.22, the M - binoid homomorphisms ψF : MF → MF ⋆G with x-f 7→ x-f and
ψG : MG → MF ⋆G with y-g 7→ y-g induce an M - binoid homomorphism

ψ : MF ∧M MG −→ MF ⋆G ,

(x-f ) ∧M (y-g) 7−→ ψF (x-f ) + ψG(y-g) = (x + y)-(f + g) ,

where x, y ∈ M , f ∈ F , and g ∈ G. On the other hand, we have by the universal property of
localization, cf. Proposition 1.13.3, an M - binoid homomorphism

φ : MF ⋆G −→ MF ∧M MG .

To see this consider the binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → MF ∧M MG with

ϕ(x) = (x-0) ∧M (0-0) = ιF (x) ∧M (0-0) = (0-0) ∧M ιG(x) = (0-0) ∧M (x-0)

(∗)
for x ∈ M . We want to show that ϕ factors through φ by applying Proposition 1.13.3. For this we
need to verify that ϕ(F ⋆ G) ⊆ (MF ∧M MG)×. So take an arbitrary x ∈ F ⋆ G. Then x + u = f + g
for some u ∈ M , f ∈ F , and g ∈ G. Hence,

((x-0) ∧M (0-0)) + ((u-f ) ∧M 0-g) = ((x + u)-f ) ∧M (0-g)
= ((f + g)-f ) ∧M (0-g)
= ((g-0) + (0-0)) ∧M (0-g)
= (0-0) ∧M ((g-0) + (0-g))
= (0-0) ∧M (0-0)
= 0∧M .

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Hence, ϕ(x) ∈ (MF ∧M MG)× with inverse −ϕ(x) = (u-f ) ∧M (0-g). The M - binoid homomorphism
φ is therefore given by

We claim that φ and ψ are inverse to each other. First consider an element z-x ∈ MF ⋆G, where
x + u = f + g with u ∈ M , f ∈ F , and g ∈ G. Then

φ(z-x) = ϕ(z) + (−ϕ(x)) .

ψφ(z-x) = ψ(ϕ(z)) + ψ(−ϕ(x))

= ψ(z ∧M 0) + ψ((u-f ) ∧M (0-g))
= (z-0) + (u-(f + g))

= (z-0) + (0-x)

= z-x .

By making use of (∗), we ﬁnally obtain for x, y ∈ M , f ∈ F , and g ∈ G,

φψ((x-f ) ∧M (y-g)) = φ((x + y)-(f + g))

= ϕ(x + y) + (−ϕ(f + g))
= ((x-0) ∧M (y-0)) + ((0-f ) ∧M (0-g))
= (x-f ) ∧M (y-g) ,

where −ϕ(f + g) = (0-f ) ∧M (0-g) because ϕ(f + g) = ((f + g)-0) ∧M (0-0) = (f -0) ∧M (g-0) in
MF ∧M MG.
Deﬁnition 1.13.10. Let M be a binoid and N the submonoid of M that is generated by M • . The
binoid MN =: diﬀ(M ) will be called the d i f f e r e n c e b i n o i d of M .
In other words, if M is integral, then diﬀ(M ) = MM • is a binoid group and diﬀ(M ) = {∞} otherwise.
Proposition 1.13.11. Let S be a submonoid of M . The binoid homomorphism ιS : M → MS is
injective if and only if S consists only of regular elements. In particular, every regular binoid M is
embedded into a binoid group, namely diﬀ(M ).

Proof. Clear, because ιS is injective if and only if a + s = b + s for a, b ∈ M , s ∈ S, implies a = b.
In the regular situation, we identify a ∈ M with a-0 ∈ MS.
Corollary 1.13.12. Let M be a binoid and G a binoid group. Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M →
G with ϕ(a) 6= ∞ for a ∈ M • gives rise to an M - binoid homomorphism ˜ϕ : diﬀ(M ) → G with
˜ϕι = ϕ, where ι : M → diﬀ(M ) denotes the canonical binoid homomorphism. In particular, for every
binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → G there exists a unique injective factorization

73

Proof. Since every binoid group is regular, there exists no such binoid homomorphism ϕ for a non-
integral binoid M . Therefore, we only need to consider the case of M being integral; that is, when
diﬀ(M ) = MM • . If M is integral, the assumption ϕ(a) 6= ∞ for a ∈ M • is equivalent to ϕ(M • ) ⊆ G×.
So we can apply Proposition 1.13.3, which provides the unique M - binoid homomorphism ˜ϕ with ˜ϕι =
ϕ. This proves the ﬁrst statement. By Proposition 1.7.14(2), there is a factorization ψ : Ncan → G,
which fulﬁlls the assumption of the ﬁrst statement since the integrality of G implies that of N by
Lemma 1.7.3, and hence that of Ncan. The injectivity of the factorization diﬀ(Ncan) → G follows from
Proposition 1.13.11.

Lemma 1.13.13. Let M be a regular binoid. The binoid group diﬀ(M ) is torsion-free if and only if
M is torsion-free.

Proof. Any equation nx = ny for some x, y ∈ M and n ≥ 1 in M is equivalent to n(x-0) = n(y-0)
in diﬀ(M ), which implies that x = y because M is cancellative and diﬀ(M ) is torsion-free. For the
converse assume that n(x-s) = 0-0 in diﬀ(M )• . Since M is cancellative, this is equivalent to nx = ns,
hence x = s because M is torsion-free, and so x-s = 0-0 = 0.

1.14 Integrality

In this section, we introduce integral binoid homomorphisms and related objects such as the integral
closure and the normalization of a (regular) binoid.

Deﬁnition 1.14.1. A binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N is called i n t e g r a l if for every a ∈ N there
is an integer k ≥ 1 such that ka ∈ ϕ(M ). In this case, we say N is i n t e g r a l o v e r M (via ϕ).
Lemma 1.14.2. Let M be a subbinoid of the commutative binoid N . If N is integral over M with
respect to the inclusion ι : M ֒→ N , then N × ∩ M = M ×.
Proof. Only the inclusion ⊆ is not obvious. So assume that a ∈ N × ∩ M and denote by -a ∈ N the
inverse of a. By assumption, there is a k ≥ 1 with k(-a) ∈ M . Then c := k(-a) + (k− 1)a ∈ M satisﬁes
a + c = 0, hence a ∈ M ×.
Deﬁnition 1.14.3. Let M be a subbinoid of the binoid N . The i n t e g r a l c l o s u r e of M in N
:= {a ∈ N | na ∈ M for some integer n ≥ 1}. M is i n t e g r a l l y c l o s e d in N
is the binoid M
the n o r m a l i z a t i o n of M , which will usually be

= M . If M is regular, we call M

abbreviated with M . We say M is n o r m a l if M = M .

The integral closure is a subbinoid of N because if a, b ∈ M
then mn(a + b) ∈ M and so a + b ∈ M
Proposition 1.14.4. Let M be a subbinoid of the binoid N such that N is integral over M with
respect to the inclusion ι : M ֒→ N and let L denote an arbitrary binoid. The induced semigroup

1 Basic concepts of binoids

Proof. The induced semigroup homomorphism ι∗ comes from Proposition 1.5.6. To prove the injec-
tivity for L torsion-free suppose that ψ, ψ′ ∈ L- spec N with ψ|M = ψ′
|M . By assumption, there is for
every a ∈ N \ M an integer k ≥ 2 such that ka = b ∈ M . Then kψ(a) = ψ(b) = ψ′(b) = kψ′(a), and
hence ψ(a) = ψ′(a) since L is torsion-free.
Now let N be commutative and L boolean. For the surjectivity of ι∗ let ϕ ∈ L- spec M be given.
Since the inclusion ι : M ֒→ N is integral and injective, there is for every a ∈ N a unique element
b ∈ M such that ka = b, where we can choose the integer k ≥ 1 to be minimal with respect to the
property na ∈ M , n ≥ 1. This yields a well-deﬁned map ˜ϕ : N → L with ˜ϕ(a) := ϕ(b), where b ∈ M
is this unique element for a ∈ N . By deﬁnition, ˜ϕι = ϕ. To see that ˜ϕ is a binoid homomorphism let
a, a′ ∈ N with ka = b, k′a′ = b′, and l(a + a′) = c with b, b′, c ∈ M , and k, k′, l ≥ 1 minimal so that
˜ϕ(a) = ϕ(b), ˜ϕ(a′) = ϕ(b′), and ˜ϕ(a + a′) = ϕ(c). Since b, b′, c, and all their multiples lie in M and L
is boolean, we obtain

˜ϕ(a + a′) = ϕ(c) = kk′ϕ(c) = ϕ(kk′c) = ˜ϕ(kk′c) = ˜ϕ(kk′la + kk′la′)

= ˜ϕ(k′lb + klb′)
= ϕ(k′lb + klb′)
= k′lϕ(b) + klϕ(b′)
= ϕ(b) + ϕ(b′)
= ˜ϕ(a) + ˜ϕ(a′) .

By Lemma 1.5.8, L- spec M and L- spec N are boolean semibinoids with absorbing elements χM × :
M → L and χN × : N → L, respectively. By Lemma 1.14.2, χN ×ι = χN ×∩M = χM × , which shows
that ι∗ is a semibinoid isomorphism. The supplement is obvious.

Example 1.14.5. The binoid homomorphism N∞ → N∞ with n 7→ kn is integral. If L = C and
k ≥ 2, the corresponding semigroup homomorphism

C- spec N∞ −→ C- spec N∞

is surjective but not injective. In case L = R and k ≥ 2, the corresponding semigroup homomorphism
is neither surjective nor injective.
For an algebraic closed ﬁeld L, every integral binoid embedding M ֒→ N yields an integral L - algebra
homomorphism L[M ] ֒→ L[N ], and therefore a semigroup epimorphism between the L - spectra. See
the subsequent discussion of [47, Example 2.B.16].

Now we will state well-known structure theorems on ﬁnitely generated commutative monoids trans-
lated to binoids, cf. [48]. Recall that an a f f i n e m o n o i d is a monoid M which is ﬁnitely generated,
cancellative, and torsion-free. Equivalently, M is a submonoid of Zd for some d ≥ 0, cf. [11, Chapter
2.A].

Proposition 1.14.6. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated binoid.

(1) M is regular if and only if it is isomorphic to a subbinoid of (Zs ×Qr

s ≥ 0 and n1, . . . , nr ≥ 2.

(2) M is regular and torsion-free if and only if it is isomorphic to a subbinoid of (Zs)∞ for some

s ≥ 0.

(3) M is positive, regular, and torsion-free if and only if it is isomorphic to a subbinoid of (Nd)∞

for some d ≥ 0.

(4) If M is regular and positive, then it is isomorphic to a subbinoid of (Nd ×Qr

some d ≥ 1 and n1, . . . , nr ≥ 2.

Proof. (1) By Proposition 1.13.11 and Corollary 1.13.7, a ﬁnitely generated binoid is regular if and only
if it can be embedded into a ﬁnitely generated abelian binoid group, namely diﬀ(M ), which is given
as displayed by the structure theorem for ﬁnitely generated abelian groups. (2) follows immediately
from Lemma 1.13.13 and (1).
(3) By (2), M is positive, regular, and torsion-free if and only if M • is a positive aﬃne monoid which
is equivalent to M • is a submonoid of Nd for some d ≥ 0 by [11, Proposition 2.17].
(4) If M is regular and positive, we may identify M with its image under the canonical embedding
ι : M ֒→ diﬀ(M ) = Zs × T , where T is a torsion group, cf. (1). If

F := {f ∈ Zs | (f, t) ∈ M for some t ∈ T} ,

then M • = F × T . Clearly, F is a submonoid of Zs, that is to say, F is an aﬃne monoid. Furthermore,
F is positive since M = (F × T )∞ is so. Indeed, if x, -x ∈ F , then (x, t), (-x, t′) ∈ M for some t, t′ ∈ T .
With n := ord T this yields

n((x, t) + (-x, t′)) = n(0, t + t′) = (0, 0) ,

which is a contradiction to M positive. Thus, F is isomorphic to a submonoid of Nd for some d ≥ 0
by (3).

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

In this chapter, we develop the ideal theory of commutative binoids in a manner parallel to that of
rings. The main diﬀerences are that in the ideal theory of binoids the union of (prime) ideals is again
a (prime) ideal and that every binoid is local in the sense that it admits a unique maximal ideal (with
respect to ⊆), which is prime. These two characteristics of binoids account for the main deviations
from the ideal theory of rings, cf. Remark 1.4.35 and Remark 2.2.25. Introducing the (Rees) quotient
by an ideal as an important tool emphasizes again the beneﬁt of an absorbing element. There are one-
to-one corrrespondences between the prime ideals, ﬁlters, and {0,∞} - valued binoid homomorphisms
of a binoid from which the spectrum of particular binoids can easily be deduced by taking advantage
of the more general descriptions of N - spec given in Chapter 1. A treatment of the spectrum as a
topological space will follow in Section 4.1. We close this section with the study on minimal prime
ideals.

The similarities and diﬀerences between the ideal theory of binoids and the that of rings have been
intensively studied in [3]. An elaboration on the ideal theory of monoids can be found in [38]. In both
publications, the theory of binoids and monoids that satisfy the ascending chain condition on ideals
and the theory of primary ideals and primary decompositions have been established to a great part.

Convention. In this chapter, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative.

2.1 Ideals

Deﬁnition 2.1.1. Let M be a binoid. An i d e a l in M is a subset I ⊆ M with ∞ ∈ I and x + M ⊆ I
for all x ∈ I.
Clearly, M itself is an ideal, the u n i t i d e a l , and an ideal coincides with M if and only if it contains
a unit. The condition ∞ ∈ I is equivalent to I 6= ∅. By deﬁnition, a nonempty subset I of M is an
ideal if and only if I is an M - set with respect to the addition on M restricted to I:

M × I −→ I ,

(x, a) 7−→ x + a .
Example 2.1.2. Some sets considered before turn out to be ideals.
(1) The subset {∞} is an ideal in every binoid M .
(2) The set of all nonunits M+ = M \ M × of a nonzero binoid M is an ideal in M since a + b 6∈ M ×

if a or b ∈ M+.

(3) The kernel of a binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N is an ideal in M because a ∈ ker ϕ and
b ∈ M implies ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b) = ∞. This is a special case of Lemma 2.1.4(1) below (with
J = {∞}). For instance, if (S, p) is an N - set, the set {a ∈ N | a + s = p for all s ∈ S} ⊆ N
is an ideal in N since it is the kernel of the binoid homomorphism N → (mapp(S, S),◦, id, ϕ∞),
cf. Lemma 1.10.3. Also, the kernel of the canonical projection π : M → M/ ∼ is an ideal
for every ideal congruence ∼. In particular, for a nonzero binoid M the set of all non-integral
elements intc(M ) and the set of all nilpotent elements nil(M ) are ideals in M , cf. Lemma 1.7.6.
Algorithms for computing intc(M ) and nil(M ) (in terms of generators of an ideal, see below) for
a ﬁnitely generated binoid M are given in [50, Algorithm 9 and Algorithm 12].

78

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

(4) The set I + J = {a + b | a ∈ I, b ∈ J } for two ideals I,J ⊆ M is an ideal in M . In particular,

for any n ≥ 0,

nI = I + ··· + I = {a1 + ··· + an | ai ∈ I}

is an ideal (note that 0I = M according to our convention that the empty sum is 0).

(5) Clearly, every ideal in a ring R is an ideal in (R,·, 1, 0). The converse is false. For instance, the

set {a | a = 0 or |a| ≥ 10} is an ideal in the binoid (Z,·, 1, 0) but not an ideal in the ring Z.

Deﬁnition 2.1.3. We refer to M+ as the m a x i m a l
in M with respect to ⊆. A binoid homomorphism ϕ : N → M is l o c a l if ϕ(N+) ⊆ M+.
Lemma 2.1.4. Let ϕ : M → N be a homomorphism of binoids.
(1) If J is an ideal in N , then ϕ−1(J ) is an ideal in M .
(2) If I is an ideal in M , then ϕ(I) + N = {a + b | a ∈ ϕ(I), b ∈ N} is an ideal in N .
Proof. Both assertions are easily veriﬁed.

i d e a l of M because it is the largest ideal 6= M

Deﬁnition 2.1.5. The ideal ϕ(I) + N from Lemma 2.1.4 is called the e x t e n d e d i d e a l of I by ϕ.
Corollary 2.1.6. Let M be a binoid and S a submonoid of M .
(1) If I is an ideal in MS, then ι−1
(2) If I is an ideal in M , then IS := {a-s | a ∈ I, s ∈ S} is an ideal in MS such that IS = MS if

S (I) is an ideal in M .

and only if S ∩ I 6= ∅.

Proof. These are immediate consequences of Lemma 2.1.4. For (2) note that IS = ιS(I) + MS.
To describe the structure of the set of ideals of a binoid, we need the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.1.7. A l a t t i c e L is a set that is both a join- and meet-semilattice; that is, (L,∪) and
(L,∩) are boolean commutative semigroups, which are related by the absorption laws a ∪ (a ∩ b) = a
and a ∩ (a ∪ b) = a for all a, b ∈ L. A lattice is c o m p l e t e if any subset has a least upper and
a greatest lower bound with respect to the partial order ⊆ on L deﬁned by a ⊆ b :⇔ a ∪ b = b (or
a ⊆ b :⇔ a ∩ b = a). In particular, the lattice itself is bounded by a largest and a smallest element.
Lemma 2.1.8. The union and the intersection of ideals in a binoid M is again an ideal in M ; that
is, the set of all ideals is a complete lattice, partially ordered by set inclusion with largest element M
and smallest element {∞}.

Proof. Let (Ik)k∈J be a family of ideals in M . If x ∈Sk∈J Ik, then x ∈ Il for some l ∈ J. Hence,
x + M ⊆ Il ⊆Sk∈J Ik. If x ∈Tk∈J Ik, then x ∈ Ik for all k ∈ J. Hence, x + M ⊆ Ik for all k ∈ J,
which means x + M ⊆Tk∈J Ik.

The subset of all proper ideals in a binoid M also deﬁnes a complete lattice, partially ordered by
set inclusion, because M+ is a largest element within this set. If R is a ring, the lattice of ideals of
(R,·, 1, 0) is the set of all unions of ideals in the ring R. For instance, the ideal {a | a = 0 or |a| ≥ 10}
in the binoid (Z,·, 1, 0) is the union of all ideals nZ, n ≥ 10, in the ring Z.
Remark 2.1.9. Those lattices that arise up to isomorphism as the lattice of ideals of a binoid have
been characterized by D. D. Anderson and E. W. Johnson in [3, Theorem 2.4].

Example 2.1.10. Let V be an arbitrary set. The ideal lattices of the positive binoids P(V )∩ and
P(V )∪ can be described as follows: a subset A ⊆ P(V ) is an ideal in P(V )∩ if A ∈ A and B ∈ P(V )
implies A ∩ B ∈ A. Since A ∩ B ⊆ A for all B ∈ P(V ), all subsets of A need to be contained in A.
Hence, A ⊆ P(V ) is an ideal in P(V )∩ if and only if it is subset-closed; that is, the lattice of ideals
is given by (S(V ),∩,∪). Similarly, A ⊆ P(V ) is an ideal in P(V )∪ if and only if A is superset-closed;
that is, the lattice of ideals is given by (Sc(V ),∩,∪).

2.1 Ideals

79

Note that if V is ﬁnite, every ideal A in P(V )∩ (resp. in P(V )∪) is uniquely determined by the
maximal (resp. minimal) sets in A with respect to ⊆.
Deﬁnition 2.1.11. By Lemma 2.1.8, there exists for every set of elements V ⊆ M a smallest ideal
in M containing V , which will be denoted by MhV i or simply by hV i unless the context requires
clariﬁcation. We say hV i is the ideal g e n e r a t e d by V and call the elements of V g e n e r a t o r s of
hV i. A set V ⊆ M is a m i n i m a l set of generators of an ideal I ⊆ M if hV i = I and no proper
subset of V generates I. An ideal I is f i n i t e l y g e n e r a t e d if I = hV i for a ﬁnite subset V ⊆ M .
A p r i n c i p a l

i d e a l is an ideal generated by a singleton.

Example 2.1.12. The extended ideal of I ⊆ M by ϕ : M → N is the ideal in N that is generated
by imI.
Example 2.1.13. Let V be a ﬁnite set. A minimal set of generators of an ideal A ⊆ P(V )∩ is given by
the maximal sets contained in A with respect to set inclusion, i.e. A = hmax⊆ Ai. Similarly, min⊆ A
is a minimal set of generators for every ideal A ⊆ P(V )∪. In particular, (P(V )∩)+ = P(V ) \ {V } =
hV \ {v} | v ∈ V i and (P(V )∪)+ = P(V ) \ {∅} = hv | v ∈ V i. For the principal ideals there are
one-to-one correspondences, namely

{Principal ideals of P(V )∩} ←→ Pn ←→ {Principal ideals of P(V )∪} ,

hJi = {A | A ⊆ J} ←→ J ←→ {A | J ⊆ A} = hJi

where the ﬁrst is order preserving and the latter reversing.

For the next result recall that the p r o d u c t o r d e r ≤ on Nn is deﬁned by (a1, . . . , an) ≤ (b1, . . . , bn)
if ai ≤ bi for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Proposition 2.1.14. Every ideal in (Nn)∞, n ≥ 0, is ﬁnitely generated. In particular, the ideals of
a ﬁnitely generated binoid are ﬁnitely generated.

Proof. It is clear that every ideal I in (Nn)∞ is generated by the minimal elements of I with respect
to the product order. This is a ﬁnite set by Dickson’s Lemma, cf. [48, Theorem 5.1] or [49, Lemma
8.6], which proves the ﬁrst statement. Let J be an ideal in an n-generated binoid M . The preimage
I := ε−1(J ) under the canonical binoid epimorphism ε : (Nn)∞ → M is an ideal in (Nn)∞ by Lemma
2.1.4(1). By the ﬁrst part, I is generated by ﬁnitely many elements a1, . . . , ar. Now the surjectivity
of ε implies that J is generated by ε(ai), i ∈ {1, . . . , r}.
Example 2.1.15. By (the proof of) the preceding proposition, every ideal A 6= {∞} in (Nn)∞ is of
the form hm1, . . . , mri, where {m1, . . . , mr} = min≤ A, mi ∈ Nn, and ≤ denotes the product order on
Nn. In particular, the principal ideals are given by

Ik := hki = (N≥k1 × ··· × N≥kn )∞ ⊆ (Nn)∞

where k = (k1, . . . , kn) ∈ Nn. If k, l ∈ Nn, then Ik ∩ Il = I(max(ki,li))i∈I . Similarly, every ideal in
(N∞)n is of the form hm1, . . . , mri, where {m1, . . . , mr} = min≤ A, mi ∈ (N∞)n, and ≤ is the product
order on Nn extended to (N∞)n by m ≤ ∞ for all m ∈ N. In particular, the principal ideals of (N∞)n
are given by

˜Ik := hki = N∞
≥k1 × ··· × N∞
≥∞ := {∞}. Similarly, one has ˜Ik ∩ ˜Il = ˜I(max(ki,li))i∈I
for some k = (k1, . . . , kn) ∈ (N∞)n, where N∞
for k, l ∈ (N∞)n. Note that ϕ : (N∞)n → (Nn)∞ deﬁned by ei 7→ ei and ei,∞ 7→ ∞, i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, is
a binoid epimorphism with ϕ(˜Ik) + (Nn)∞ = Ik if k ∈ Nn and {∞} otherwise.

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

Deﬁnition 2.1.16. Let I be an ideal in M . The congruence ∼I on M deﬁned by

a ∼I b

:⇔ a = b

or a, b ∈ I

is called the R e e s c o n g r u e n c e of I and M/∼I =: M/I the ( R e e s ) q u o t i e n t of M by I. The
extended ideal of an ideal J ⊆ M by the canonical projection M → M/I will be denoted by J /I.
Remark 2.1.17. The quotient M/I may be described as the result of collapsing I into a single
element, namely ∞, while the elements outside I remain unchanged. In particular, ∼I is an ideal
congruence and every ideal congruence is of this form since the kernel of a binoid homomorphism is
an ideal, cf. Example 2.1.2(3). In this spirit, M/I can be identiﬁed with the binoid (M \ I) ∪ {∞}
with addition given by

a + b = (a + b

∞

, if a + b 6∈ I ,
, otherwise,

for a, b ∈ (M \ I) ∪ {∞}. Similarly, the extended ideal of J under M → M/I can be identiﬁed with
the subset (J \ (J ∩ I)) ∪ {∞}.
Note that the congruence ∼πI induced by πI : M → M/I coincides with the Rees congruence of I;
that is, M/ ∼πI = M/I and I = ker πI . In general, if ϕ : M → N is a binoid epimorphism, the induced
homomorphism M/ ker ϕ → N fails to be an isomorphism when ∼πker ϕ 6= ∼ϕ. For instance, the kernel
of the binoid homomorphism ϕ : N∞×N∞ → N∞, (a, b) 7→ b, is given by the ideal {(a,∞) | a ∈ N∞}
and the quotient by

On the other hand, we have (N∞×N∞)/∼ϕ ∼= N∞, cf. Remark 1.6.4. See also Example 1.7.2.

(N∞ × N∞)/ ker ϕ ∼= (N∞ × N) ∪ {(∞,∞)} .

Example 2.1.18.

(1) According to Remark 2.1.17, we obtain from the observations we made in Example 2.1.2(3):

Mint = M/ intc(M ) and Mred = M/ nil(M ) .

(2) Similar to the theory of semilocal rings, we have a description of the Hilbert-Samuel function

H(−, M ) : N → N in terms of the quotient by a multiple of the maximal ideal

H(n, M ) = #(M/nM+) − 1

for a positive ﬁnitely generated binoid M .

(3) Let (Mi)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of binoids. Then

^i∈I

Mi ∼= (cid:16)Yi∈I

Mi(cid:17).I

Mi ∼= (cid:16)^i∈I

i∈I Mi are the canonical binoid epimorphisms, cf. Remark 1.9.6.

cancellative, then so is M/I.

If M is ﬁnitely generated, positive, semifree, or

2.1 Ideals

81

Proof. Only for the latter property there is something to show. So let M be cancellative. If [a + b] =
[a + c] 6= [∞] in M/I for some a, b, c ∈ M , then a + b = a + c in M , which implies b = c since M is
cancellative. Hence, [b] = [c].

If M is reduced and I ⊆ M an ideal, then M/I need not be reduced anymore. A suﬃcient condition
on I such that M/I is torsion-free if M is so, is given in Lemma 2.3.8.
Lemma 2.1.20. If M is torsion-free, then M/I is torsion-free up to nilpotence for every I in M .
Proof. Any equality [na] = [nb] 6= [∞] in M/I means na = nb in M . Hence, a = b in M by
assumption, in particular, [a] = [b] in M/I.
If I ⊆ FC(V ) is an ideal, then FC(V )/I is (ﬁnitely)
Corollary 2.1.21. Let V be a (ﬁnite) set.
generated by {v ∈ V | v 6∈ I} and semifree. In particular, FC(V )/I is positive, cancellative, and
torsion-free up to nilpotence. Conversely, every (ﬁnitely generated) semifree binoid is isomorphic to
FC(V )/I for some (ﬁnite) set V and an ideal I ⊆ FC(V ).
Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows from Corollary 1.4.28 with Lemma 2.1.19 and Lemma 2.1.20, and
its supplement from Lemma 1.4.23. For the converse take a minimal generating set of the semifree
binoid M , say V ⊆ M . Then M ∼= FC(V )/(Rj )j∈J , where (Rj )j∈J is a family of relations of the
form R : f = g, f, g ∈ FC(V ), cf. Example 1.6.7. Since M is semifree, all relations Rj are monomial
relations (i.e. Rj : fj = ∞ for all j ∈ J). This shows that the congruence deﬁned by (Rj)j∈J is the
Rees congruence of the ideal I = hfj | j ∈ Ji. Hence, M ∼= FC(V )/I by Proposition 1.6.2.
Remark 2.1.22. By Corollary 2.1.21, semifree binoids are precisely those binoids that arise from free
commutative binoids modulo monomial relations. Thus, semifree binoids could also be called monomial
binoids since their binoid algebras are monomial algebras and every (commutative) monomial algebra
can be realized as the binoid algebra of such a binoid. A special class of monomial algebras are
Stanley-Reisner algebras (or face rings), which we will encounter in Section 6.5.
Proposition 2.1.23. Let M and N be binoids and I an ideal in M . Every binoid homomorphism
ϕ : M → N with I ⊆ ker ϕ factors uniquely through M/I. In particular, we have an isomorphism of
semigroups,

N - spec M/I ∼= {ϕ ∈ N - spec M | I ⊆ ker ϕ} .

Proof. This is a special case of Proposition 1.7.5.

Proposition 2.1.24. Let I and J be ideals of M . Then

(M/I) ∧M (M/J ) ∼= M/(I ∪ J ) ,

where M/A is an M - binoid via the canonical projection πA : M → M/A, A ∈ {I,J }.
Proof. The canonical M - binoid epimorphisms ψA : M/A → M/(I ∪ J ) with ¯a 7→ [a], A ∈ {I,J },
induce by Corollary 1.10.22 an M - binoid homomorphism

ψ : (M/I) ∧M (M/J ) −→ M/(I ∪ J ) with ¯a ∧M ¯b 7−→ [¯a + ¯b] ,

which is surjective since ψI and ψJ are so. For the injectivity note that ¯a ∧M ¯b = ∞ if and only if
a + b ∈ I ∪ J , and then [¯a + ¯b] = ∞. If a ∈ I or b ∈ J this is clear. Otherwise, a 6∈ I and b 6∈ J is
equivalent to the fact that ¯a = {a} and ¯b = {b} are singletons, so we have
¯a ∧M ¯b = a ∧M b = 0 ∧M (a + b) = (a + b) ∧M 0

and this is ∞ if and only if a + b ∈ I ∪ J . In particular, [¯a + ¯b] = [a + b] = ∞. Hence, ∞ 6= ¯a ∧M ¯b =
a ∧M b 7→ [a + b] = a + b 6= ∞ if a + b 6∈ I ∪ J , which implies the injectivity.

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

Lemma 2.1.25. Let ϕ : M → N be a binoid homomorphism and I ⊆ M an ideal. Then

(M/I) ∧M N ∼= N/(ϕ(I) + N )

as binoids.

Proof. Since ker πI ⊆ ker(πϕ), and hence ∼πI ≤ ∼πϕ, we have by Lemma 1.6.3 a commutative diagram
of binoid homomorphisms

with ˜ϕ([a]) = [ϕ(a)]. In fact, the induced homomorphism ˜ϕ is an M - binoid homomorphism because
all others are so. Hence, ˜ϕ and πϕ induce by Corollary 1.10.22 a unique M - binoid homomorphism

ψ : (M/I) ∧M N −→ N/(ϕ(I) + N ) with [a] ∧M x 7−→ [ϕ(a) + x] .

On the other hand, the canonical M - binoid homomorphism ι : N → M ∧M N → (M/I) ∧M N with
ι(x) = [0] ∧M x factors through N/(ϕ(I) + N ) because ϕ(I) + N ⊆ ker ι. In other words, there is an
M - binoid homomorphism

Φ : N/(ϕ(I) + N ) −→ (M/I) ∧M N with [x] 7→ [0] ∧M x .

An easy computation shows that ψ and Φ are mutually inverse.

Remark 2.1.26. In [3], Anderson and Johnson raised the question of which binoids admit an ideal
theory most similar to that of arbitrary or noetherian rings. For the latter, they considered binoids
satisfying the a s c e n d i n g c h a i n c o n d i t i o n (a.c.c.) on ideals, which means that every chain of
ideals I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ I3 ··· in such a binoid M becomes stationary; that is, there is a k ∈ N such that
In = Ik for all n ≥ k. Equivalently, every ideal in M is ﬁnitely generated, which is a weaker property
than being noetherian as deﬁned in this thesis, cf. Remark 1.6.6 (Anderson and Johnson call binoids
that satisfy the a.c.c. on ideals noetherian).
They could prove that Krull’s intersection theorem ([13, Folgerung 5.6]) and the Artin-Rees lemma
([13, Satz 5.5]) hold true for binoids that satisfy the a.c.c. on ideals, namley, for any two ideals I and
J of such a binoid, one has

I + N = N with N := \n≥1

(nI + J ) ,

cf. [3, Theorem 3.10], and there is an m ≥ 0 such that

I ∩ kJ = (I ∩ mJ ) + (k − m)J ,

∀k ≥ m ,

cf. [3, Theorem 3.11]. An application of the Artin-Rees lemma in combination with Nakayama’s lemma

is Krull’s theorem, which says that in a noetherian ring R one has Tn≥1 an = {0} for every ideal a

contained in the Jacobson ideal of R ([13, Folgerung 5.8]).1 This need not be true for binoids. For
instance, the maximal ideal M+ of the ﬁnitely generated binoid

1 Often, this is called Krull’s intersection theorem.

M = FC(x)/(2x = x)

is hxi, and obviously M+ = 2M+ = 3M+ = ··· so thatTn≥0 nM+ = M+ 6= {∞}. Binoids that satisfy
Tn≥0 nM+ = {∞} are called separated and are the main subject of Chapter 5.

Nakayama’s lemma ([13, Satz 3.19]) does not translate directly to binoids either. The canonical
projection π : N∞ → (Z/nZ)∞ for n ≥ 2 turns ((Z/nZ)∞,∞) into a ﬁnitely generated N∞ - set, but
for every principal ideal Ik := hki = N∞

≥k, k ≥ 1, in N∞, one has

π(Ik) + (Z/nZ)∞ = (Z/nZ)∞ 6= {0,∞} .

For monoids that satisfy the a.c.c. on ideals, The Artin-Rees lemma [38, Lemma 3.3.8], Krull’s
theorem [38, Satz 3.3.9], and some version of Nakayama’s lemma [38, Lemma 3.3.1] have been proved
by Kobsa, where the latter two results require in addition that the monoid M is cancellative in the
sense of monoid theory (i.e. M ∞ has to be cancellative in our terms). Kobsa also studied monoids
that satisfy the a.c.c. on submonoids, cf. [38, Chapter 7.4]. For this see also [30, Chapter VI.7].

Lemma 2.1.27. Let I ( N be an ideal.
ϕ(I) + M 6= M .
Proof. If ϕ(I) + M = M , then ϕ(a) + b = 0 for some a ∈ I and b ∈ M , and so ϕ(a) ∈ M ×, which
contradicts ϕ being local since a ∈ I ⊆ N+.
In [2], certain versions of Nakayama’s lemma satisﬁed by S - acts are studied.

If ϕ : N → M is a local binoid homomorphism, then

2.2 Prime ideals

Deﬁnition 2.2.1. An ideal P ( M is called p r i m e if M \ P is a submonoid of M . The s p e c t r u m
of M , denoted by spec M , is the set of all prime ideals of M .

Example 2.2.2. Let M 6= {∞}.
(1) The maximal ideal M+ is prime since M \ M+ = M × is a subgroup of M (i.e. a submonoid that

is also a group). Therefore, spec M 6= ∅ if and only if M 6= {∞}.

(2) The ideal intc(M ) of all non-integral elements is prime since M\intc(M ) = int(M ) is a submonoid

of M , cf. Lemma 1.4.6.

The set of all ideals is a complete lattice with respect to ∩ and ∪. This translates not to the full
extent to the subset spec M .

Proposition 2.2.3. The union of a set of prime ideals is again a prime ideal. In particular, the
spectrum of a nonzero binoid M is a (join-) semilattice with largest element M+.

Proof. By Lemma 2.1.8, the unionSi∈I Pi of a family of prime ideals (Pi)i∈I is an ideal and since the
intersection of submonoids of M is again a submonoid, we obtain M \Si∈I Pi =Ti∈I (M \ Pi).

The preceding result is the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the ideal theories of binoids and rings
because it contradicts the prime avoidance lemma (which states that in a ring an ideal contained in a
union of n ideals with at least n − 2 prime lies in one of the n ideals, cf. [9, II §1.2, Proposition 2] or
[23, Lemma 3.3]). As this lemma has many consequences in ring theory, Proposition 2.2.3 accounts
for many of the diﬀerences between the theories of binoids and rings. See for instance Proposition
2.2.24 and the subsequent remark.

Proposition 2.2.4. The intersection of a ﬁnite family of diﬀerent prime ideals is prime if and only
if the family admits a unique minimal element with respect to set inclusion (i.e. a prime ideal which
is contained in any other prime ideal of the family).

84

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

Proof. The if part is trivial. For the converse let M be a binoid and (Pi)i∈I a ﬁnite family of diﬀerent
prime ideals in M that admits strictly more than one minimal element with respect to set inclusion.
Say P1, . . . ,Pn, n ≥ 2, are those minimal elements of the family. By the minimality, there are elements

xij ∈ Pi \ (Pi ∩ Pj) for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} with i 6= j. Thus,Pi6=j xij ∈Tn
i=1 Pi =Ti∈I Pi, but by
construction none of the xij is contained in the intersection. Hence, the idealTi∈I Pi is not prime.

Here is an example showing that the only if part of the preceding result may fail for an inﬁnite
familiy of prime ideals. Let I be inﬁnite and let Pi denote the ideal hei, ei+1, ei+2 . . .i in (NI )∞, where
the ith component of ei is 1 and all others are 0, i ∈ I. It is clear that all Pi are prime, and since
is a prime ideal in (NI )∞. There are other very useful characterizations of prime ideals which will be
used in the following without further reference.

Pi ⊃ Pi+1 ⊃ Pi+2 ⊃ ··· the family (Pi)i∈I admits no minimal element. However,Tn≥1 Pn = {∞}

Lemma 2.2.5. Let P 6= M be an ideal in M . The following statements are equivalent:
(1) P is prime.
(2) M/P is integral.
(3) M \ P ∈ F (M ).
(4) P is the kernel of a binoid homomorphism M → {0,∞}.
(5) a + b ∈ P for some a, b ∈ M implies that a ∈ P or b ∈ P.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) follows from the deﬁnition. (2) ⇒ (3) If M/P is integral, then M \ P =: F is a
submonoid of M , hence 0 ∈ F and f + g ∈ F if f, g ∈ F . On the other hand, if f + g ∈ F (i.e.
f + g 6∈ P), then f, g 6∈ P because P is a prime ideal. Hence, f, g ∈ F . The equivalence (3) ⇔ (4) is
just a restatement of Proposition 1.4.41 and the implications (4) ⇒ (5) ⇒ (1) are obvious.
The equivalence (1) ⇔ (4) of Lemma 2.2.5 together with Proposition 1.4.41 shows, in particular,
that P is a prime ideal if and only if αP = χM\P is a binoid homomorphism.
Corollary 2.2.6. The semibinoids {0,∞}- spec M , spec M , and F (M )∩ \ {M} are isomorphic,
namely

{0,∞}- spec M ∼←→ spec M ∼←→ F (M ) \ {M} ,

(χM\P =) αP ←−[

α 7−→ ker α
P
M \ F ←−[ F

7−→ M \ P

where the latter correspondence is inclusion reversing.

Proof. The assignments on the left-hand side are well-deﬁned and bijective by Lemma 2.2.5. The
homomorphism property for both directions can be shown similarly as in Corollary 1.5.10. This also
yields the statement for the assignments on the right-hand side.

The isomorphism {0,∞}- spec ∼= spec is due to Schwarz [52], see also [15, Lemma 5.54].
Example 2.2.7. The ideal lattices of the binoids P(V )∩ and P(V )∪ have been described in Example
2.1.10 for arbitrary V and in Example 2.1.13 for V ﬁnite. Now we determine the subsemilattices of
prime ideals for these binoids if V is ﬁnite. From the description of the ﬁlters in P(V )∩ and P(V )∪,
cf. Example 1.4.38, we obtain the following description of the prime ideals and spectra:

spec P(V )∩ = {PJ,∩ | ∅ 6= J ⊆ V } and

spec P(V )∪ = {PJ,∪ | J ( V } ,

2.2 Prime ideals

85

where PJ,∩ is the subset-closed subset {A ∈ P(V ) | J 6⊆ A}. Thus,

PJ,∩ = [j∈J

P(V \ {j}) = hV \ {j} | j ∈ Ji with PJ,∩ ∪ PI,∩ = PJ∪I,∩

and PJ,∪ is the superset-closed subset {A ∈ P(V ) | A 6⊆ J}. Thus,

PJ,∪ = P(V ) \ P(J) = h{j} | j 6∈ Ji with PJ,∪ ∪ PI,∪ = PJ∩I,∪ .

In particular,

spec P(V )∩ ∼= (P(V ) \ {∅},∪, V )

and

spec P(V )∪ ∼= (P(V ) \ {V },∩,∅)

as semibinoids, where the order-preserving correspondences are given by PJ,∩ ↔ J and PJ,∪ ↔ J.
This also shows that # spec Pn,∩ = # spec Pn,∪ = 2n − 1, n ≥ 0. The prime ideals of (Nn)∞ and
(N∞)n, n ≥ 1, will be described in Example 2.2.21.
The following corollaries are consequences of the fact that {0,∞}- spec ∼= spec and of results we
deduced from the induced homomorphism given in Proposition 1.5.6, which reads in terms of prime
ideals as follows.

Corollary 2.2.8. Let M and N be binoids. Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N induces a
semigroup homomorphism ϕ∗ : spec N → spec M with P 7→ ϕ−1(P) such that ϕ∗ is injective if ϕ is
surjective.

Proof. By Proposition 1.5.6 (with L = {0,∞}), there is semigroup homomorphism ϕ∗ : spec N →
spec M with αP 7→ αP ϕ, where αP is the anti-indicator homomorphism of the prime ideal P ∈ spec N
and ker(αP ϕ) = ϕ−1(P).
Example 2.2.9. We continue with Example 2.2.7 from above. The canonical binoid isomorphism
ϕ : P(V )∪
spec P(V )∪ with PJ 7→ PJ c .
Corollary 2.2.10. If I ⊆ M is an ideal, then spec M/I ∼= {P ∈ spec M | I ⊆ P}. More precisely,
there is an order preserving semibinoid isomorphism given by

∼→ P(V )∩ with J 7→ V \ J = J c induces a semibinoid isomorphism ϕ∗ : spec P(V )∩ →

P/I ←−[ P

where π : M → M/I denotes the canonical projection. In particular, the extended ideal of P ∈ spec M
by π is a prime ideal in M/I if and only if I ⊆ P.
Proof. Note that {P ∈ spec M | I ⊆ P} is a subsemibinoid of spec M . The isomorphism as semigroups
is just a restatement of Proposition 2.1.23 (with N = {0,∞}) using the identiﬁcation αP ↔ P of
Corollary 2.2.6. Since (M/I)+ = M+/I this is an isomorphism of semibinoids.
Corollary 2.2.11. spec M ∼= spec Mred as semibinoids for every binoid M .
Proof. If M = {∞}, the statement is trivial, and if M 6= {∞} the statement follows from Corollary
2.2.10 with I = nil M and the obvious fact that nil M ⊆ P for every P ∈ spec M . (The statement
also follows from Corollary 1.7.7 with N = {0,∞}).

there is a semigroup isomorphism

(Q) ∈ spec Mi, i ∈ I. Thus, ψ(Q) = (ι−1

ker(αQιi) = ι−1
then

where αPi : Mi → {0,∞}, i ∈ I, is the preimage of (Pi)i∈I under ψ with ker α = Si∈I bPi and bPi
as described in the statement. Hence, every prime ideal Q ∈ specVi∈I Mi is of this form for unique
Pi ∈ spec Mi, i ∈ I. In particular,Si∈I (cMi)+ is the maximal ideal ofVi∈I Mi, which shows that ψ

is an isomorphism of semibinoids.

given in Proposition 1.8.14 (with N = {0,∞}). We use the identiﬁcation P ↔ αP of Corollary 2.2.6
and the description of the prime ideals of the smash product, cf. Corollary 2.2.12, for the map between
the disjoint unions on the left-hand side. From these results, we deduce that the semigroup structures
of the disjoint unions (as decribed in Proposition 1.8.14 for αP ) admit absorbing elements, namely

(((Mi)+)i∈I ; I) and (Si∈I (cMi)+; I). This shows that the ﬁrst map is a semibinoid isomorphism with
((Pi)i∈J ; J) 7→ (Si∈J bPi; J), where bPi = ∧k∈IAk with Ak = Mk for k 6= i and Ai = Pi. By the proof

of Proposition 1.8.14, the semigroup isomorphism on the right-hand side is given by (αP ; J) 7→ αP ππJ ,

with Ak = Mk if k 6= i and Ai = Pi otherwise, and (Pi)i∈I is an element of the semibinoid on the

Proof. The isomorphism as semigroups is just a restatement of Proposition 1.10.24 (with L = {0,∞})
using the identiﬁcation αP ↔ P of Corollary 2.2.6. The supplement follows from Corollary 2.2.12

since VN Mi is a quotient of Vi∈I Mi. This shows that this is a semibinoid isomophism because
Si∈I ( ˜Mi)+ ↔ ((Mi)+)i∈I .

Corollary 2.2.15. Let (Mi)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of positive binoids. Then

i∈I Mi is of the form P(j) = Ui∈I Ai, where Ai = (Mi; i) for i 6= j and

Aj = (P; j), P ∈ spec Mj \ {(Mj)+} for some j ∈ I.
Proof. The isomorphism and the description of the prime ideals follow from Corollary 1.9.10 (with
N = {0,∞}) using the identiﬁcation αP ↔ P of Corollary 2.2.6.
Corollary 2.2.16. Given a subbinoid M of N such that N is integral over M with respect to the

In particular, spec M ∼= spec M
Proof. This is just a restatement of Proposition 1.14.4 (with L = {0,∞}), using the identiﬁcation
αP ↔ P of Corollary 2.2.6.
Corollary 2.2.17. Let M be a binoid and S a submonoid of M . The canonical homomorphism

Proof. This is just a restatement of Corollary 1.13.4 (with N = {0,∞}), using the identiﬁcation

Deﬁnition 2.2.18. If P is a prime ideal, we use the common notation MP for the localization of M
at the ﬁlter M \ P and ιP for the canonical homomorphism M → MP .
With this notation Corollary 1.13.5 now translates to the following result.
Corollary 2.2.19. Let S be a submonoid of M with ∞ 6∈ S. Then MS ∼= MP , where P is the prime
ideal M \ Filt(S). Moreover, the unique maximal prime ideal of MP is the extended ideal ιP (P) + MP .

88

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

Proof. By Corollary 1.13.5, we have MS ∼= MFilt(S) = MP. Thus, we only need to verify that
(MP)× = MP \ (ιP (P) + MP). For the inclusion ⊇ let a-s ∈ MP, a ∈ M , s 6∈ P. If a 6∈ P, then
s-a ∈ MP , which is the inverse of s-a, hence (a-s) ∈ (MP )×. Conversely, if a-s is a unit, there are
elements b ∈ M and t 6∈ P such that 0 = (a-s) + (b-t) = (a + b)-(s + t), which is equivalent to
a + b + c = s + t + c for some c 6∈ P. Since s + t + c 6∈ P, the element a lies not in P. Hence,
a-s 6∈ (ιP (P) + MP).
Proposition 2.2.20. If M is a binoid with generating set V ⊆ M , then every prime ideal of M is of
the form hAi for some subset A ⊆ V . In particular, # spec M ≤ 2#V .
Proof. If M = {∞}, the statement is clear, so let M 6= {∞}. Note that every ideal of the form hAi,
∅ 6= A ( V , is prime. On the other hand, consider P ∈ spec M . If P = {∞}, then M is integral

and P = h∅i. So let P 6= {∞}. Every ∞ 6= f ∈ P can be written as f =Px∈V nxx, where nx 6= 0

for at least one but only ﬁnitely many x ∈ V . By the prime property, we get x ∈ P for at least one
x ∈ {v ∈ V | nv 6= 0}, which proves the ﬁrst statement. The supplement is clear.
Example 2.2.21. Let I = {1, . . . , n}, n ≥ 1.
(1) The binoid (Nn)∞ admits a minimal generating set given by ei, i ∈ I, cf. Proposition 1.4.27,
and all ideals hei | i ∈ Ji, J ⊆ I, are prime, which implies that # spec(Nn)∞ = 2n. This shows
that the bound in Proposition 2.2.20 is sharp.

(2) The binoid (N∞)n is generated by the 2n elements ei, ei,∞, i ∈ I, cf. Example 1.3.2(3). Thus,
the prime ideals are of the form PJ ′,J = hei, ej,∞ | i ∈ J ′, j ∈ Ji, where J ′, J ⊆ Pn with J ′ 6= ∅
or J 6= ∅ because (N∞)n is not integral. Since ei + ei,∞ = ei,∞, we have PJ ′,J = PJ ′,J∪J ′.
Therefore, the diﬀerent prime ideals of (N∞)n are given by

where ∅ 6= J ⊆ Pn and J ′ ⊆ J. Hence, # spec(N∞)n =Pn

spec(N∞)2 consisting of 8 prime ideals can be illustrated as follows

(3) The bipointed unionS:

i∈I N∞ is minimally generated by (1; i), i ∈ I, cf. Proposition 1.4.27. If
P is a prime ideal with (1; i) 6∈ P, then (1; j) ∈ P for every j 6= i because (1; i) + (1; j) = ∞ ∈ P

when j 6= i. Hence, the prime ideals ofS:
i ∈ I, and (S:

i∈I N∞)+ = h(1; i) | i ∈ Ii. In particular, # specS:

i∈I N∞ are given by

Pi := h(1; j) | j ∈ I, j 6= ii ,

(4) Consider the binoid M := FC(x1, . . . , xn)/(xi + xi+1 = xi)i∈I\{n}). If ∅ 6= J ⊆ I, then

i∈I N∞ = n + 1.

PJ := hxi | i ∈ Ji = hxsi

with s := max≤J. Thus, spec M is a totally ordered complete lattice given by the following
sequence of principal ideals

{∞} ⊂ hx1i ⊂ hx2i ⊂ ··· ⊂ hxni = M+ .

(5) The prime ideal intc(M ) is generated by those generators of M that are not integral.

(6) The spectra of the four diﬀerent types of one-generated binoids

N∞ ,

(Z/nZ)∞ , N∞/(r = s) ,

and

N∞/(n = ∞) ,

cf. Corollary 1.12.8, are

{{∞},h1i} ,

{{∞}} ,

{{∞},h1i} ,

and

{h1i} .

Example 2.2.22. The spectrum spec M =: I of a (ﬁnitely generated) binoid M is a partially ordered
(ﬁnite) set such that

where

(M/P, (ϕPQ)Q⊆P )P,Q∈I ,

ϕPQ : M/Q −→ M/P

is the canonical projection for Q ⊆ P, is an inverse system of binoids. The projective limit of this
system is given by

M/P = n(aP )P∈I ∈ YP∈I

lim←−P∈I

M/P (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ϕPQ(aQ) = aP for all Q ⊆ Po

together with the canonical projections ϕQ : lim←− M/P → M/Q with (aP )P∈I 7−→ aQ, Q ∈ I, cf.
Section 1.11 (here, the partial order ≥ on I is given by Q ≥ P if Q ⊆ P). Note that if M is positive,
then M/M+ = {0,∞} and ϕM+P : M/P → {0,∞} is the binoid homomorphism sending everything
but 0 to ∞ (i.e. ϕM+P = χ{0}).
If, for instance, I contains one minimal element with respect to ⊆, say Q, then there is for every
P ∈ I a binoid homomorphism ϕPQ : M/Q → M/P, which is the identity on {a ∈ M/Q | a 6∈ P} =
(M/Q) \ ker ϕPQ. Hence,

M/P = n(ϕPQ(a))P∈I ∈ YP∈I

∼= n(a, ϕPQ(a))P6=Q (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) a ∈ M/Q, a 6= 0o ∪ {(0, . . . , 0)} ∼= M/Q .

As another example consider the binoid M = S: n
i=1 N∞ from 2.2.21(3) (with the notation given there).
The inverse system of M is given by the n + 1 binoids M/M+ = {0,∞}, M/Pi = (N∞; i) ∼= N∞,
i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, together with the binoid homomorphisms ϕM+Pi : (N∞; i) → {0,∞}, ϕPiPi = id(N∞;i)
for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and ϕM+M+ = id{0,∞}. Hence,

M/P = {(∞, a) | a ∈ (N∞

≥1)n} ∪ {(0, . . . , 0} ∼= (N∞

≥1)n ∪ {(0, . . . , 0} ,

lim←−P∈I

which is not a ﬁnitely generated binoid if n ≥ 2, though M is so. We will come back to these examples
later in Example 3.2.7.

Remark 2.2.23. Let N and M be binoids. Every N - point ϕ ∈ N - spec M factors uniquely through
ker ϕ, cf. Lemma 1.7.3, which is a prime ideal. Indeed, we can write

N - spec M = ]P∈spec M

SP ,

90

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

where SP := {ϕ ∈ N - spec M | ker ϕ = P} ∼= N - spec(M/P) is a subsemigroup of N - spec M in which
the characteristic point χM\P serves as an identity element. Moreover, SP + SQ ⊆ SP∪Q. See also
If N is a binoid group, then SP ∼= N - spec diﬀ((M/P)can) by Corollary 1.13.12.
[15, Chapter 5].
Therefore,

#N - spec M = XP∈spec M

#N - spec diﬀ((M/P)can)

when spec M and N - spec diﬀ((M/P)can), P ∈ spec M , are ﬁnite. Take for instance a ﬁnitely generated
torsion-free binoid M . By Lemma 1.13.13, diﬀ((M/P)can) is a ﬁnitely generated torsion-free group,
which implies that diﬀ((M/P)can) = ZlP for some lP ∈ N by the structure theorem of ﬁnitely generated
commutative groups. Hence, #F∞

q - spec M = PP∈spec M (q − 1)lP . See also Proposition 4.4.7.

Finally, we state a result which we will need later.

Proposition 2.2.24. Let M be a binoid and I ⊆ M an ideal.
If N is a submonoid of M with
N ∩ I = ∅, then I is contained in a unique ideal P ⊆ M which is maximal with respect to N ∩ P = ∅.
Moreover, P is prime.
Proof. Let P be the union of all ideals J with I ⊆ J ⊆ M \ N . Then P is an ideal contained in
M \ N by Proposition 2.2.3. We have to show that P is prime. For this suppose that a + b ∈ P
with a, b ∈ M \ P. By the maximality of P among all ideals with N ∩ P = ∅, there are elements
x ∈ (P ∪ hai) ∩ N and y ∈ (P ∪ hbi) ∩ N . Hence, x = a + m and y = b + m′ for some m, m′ ∈ N
because N ∩P = ∅. Then x + y = a + b + m + m′ ∈ N ∩P, which is a contradiction to N ∩P = ∅.
Remark 2.2.25. As the analogous statement for rings, Proposition 2.2.24 implies (take N = {0})
that every proper ideal I in a binoid M is contained in a maximal prime ideal. This result is trivial
since M+ is prime and the upper bound of the lattice of ideals in M , cf. Lemma 2.1.8. Note that
Proposition 2.2.24 is stronger than the analogous statement for rings since for rings the ideal P need
not be unique.
When dealing with primary ideals and primary decompositions in binoids, cf. [3] for a thorough
investigation, one encounters even more consequences of the fact that the union of prime ideals is
again a prime ideal. For instance, similar to a result of ring theory ([4, Proposition 4.7]), one can
show that, if an ideal I ⊆ M admits a primary decomposition, then the set

{a ∈ M | a + b ∈ I for some b ∈ M \ I} = I ∪ intc(M/I)

is the union of the unique associated primes of I, hence I ∪ intc(M/I) is again a prime ideal. This
shows that a prime ideal in a binoid consisting of non-integral elements (zero-divisors in terms of ring
theory) need not be contained in an associated prime.

2.3 Minimal prime ideals

Deﬁnition 2.3.1. Let M be a binoid and I an ideal in M . A prime ideal P containing I is a
m i n i m a l p r i m e of I if there is no prime ideal Q with I ⊆ Q ( P. The set of all minimal prime
ideals of I is denoted by minM I. The minimal prime ideals of the zero ideal {∞} are called the
m i n i m a l p r i m e i d e a l s of M and the set of all of them will be denoted by min M (instead of
minM{∞}). The ﬁlter M \ P deﬁned by a minimal prime ideal P ∈ min M is called an u l t r a f i l t e r .
If M is integral, the zero ideal is the only minimal prime ideal of M . There are other very useful
characterizations of minimal prime ideals which will be used without further references.

2.3 Minimal prime ideals

91

Lemma 2.3.2. Let M be a binoid, I an ideal in M , and P ∈ spec M containing I. The following
statements are equivalent:
(1) P is a minimal prime of I.
(2) M\P is a submonoid of M which is maximal among all submonoids S ⊆ M with S ∩ I = ∅.
(3) For each p ∈ P, there is an element a ∈ M \ P such that a + np ∈ I for some n ≥ 1.
In particular, if p is an element of a minimal prime ideal P of M , then a+np = ∞ for some a ∈ M \P
and n ≥ 1.
Proof. Set F := M \ P. For the implication (1) ⇒ (2), only the maximality of F has to be veriﬁed
since F is a ﬁlter with F ∩I = ∅ by deﬁnition. So suppose that S is another submonoid with S∩I = ∅
and F ( S. By Proposition 2.2.24, there is a unique prime ideal Q which is maximal with respect
to S ∩ Q = ∅. In particular, F ∩ Q = ∅. The uniqueness of Q yields Q ( P, but this contradicts
the minimality of P. To prove (2) ⇒ (3) take an arbitrary p ∈ P and deﬁne N (p) := {a + ip | a ∈
F, i ∈ N} ⊆ M . The set N (p) is a submonoid of M with F ⊆ N (p). By the maximality of F , we have
N (p) ∩ I 6= ∅, hence a + np ∈ I for some a ∈ S. (Note that n = 0 is needed to have a submonoid
containing F , but a 6∈ I for all a ∈ F ). (3) ⇒ (1) Finally, suppose that (3) holds for P and there is a
prime ideal Q with I ⊆ Q ( P. Choose p ∈ P such that p 6∈ Q. By assumption, there is an element
a ∈ F and an n ≥ 1 such that a + np ∈ I ⊆ Q. Hence, p ∈ Q or a ∈ Q because Q is prime, but neither
is true. Thus, P has to be minimal over I.
Minimal prime ideals of an ideal always exist. To show this, we need the following lemma.

Lemma 2.3.3. Let I be an ideal in M . If N is a submonoid of M with N ∩ I = ∅, then N is
contained in a submonoid which is maximal with respect to this property.

Proof. This is an easy consequence of Zorn’s Lemma.

Proposition 2.3.4. The set of minimal prime ideals of an ideal I 6= M in a binoid is not empty. In
particular, min M 6= ∅ and every prime ideal contains a minimal prime ideal.
Proof. Since the submonoid M × does not meet I, there exsists a submonoid N ⊆ M which is maximal
with respect to this property by Lemma 2.3.3. Obviously, the prime ideal M \N is minimal over I.
Deﬁnition 2.3.5. The r a d i c a l of an ideal I, denoted by √I, is the set of all a ∈ M such that
na ∈ I for some n ∈ N. An Ideal I ⊆ M with √I = I is called a r a d i c a l
of an ideal I is a radical ideal since p√I = √I. In particular, the ideal nil(M ) is a radical ideal
because it is the radical of the zero ideal (i.e.p{∞} = nil(M )). Therefore, nil(M ) is also called the

Example 2.3.6. Obviously, the unit ideal M and all prime ideals are radical ideals. The radical

i d e a l .

n i l r a d i c a l .

Lemma 2.3.7. An ideal I of M is a radical ideal if and only if M/I is reduced.
Proof. Let I be a radical ideal. If [∞] = k[a] = [ka] for some a ∈ M and k ≥ 1, then ka ∈ I, which
implies that a ∈ I, so [a] = [∞]. This proves that M/I is reduced. Conversely, if M/I is reduced, it
is enough to verify that √I ⊆ I since the other inclusion is obvious. So let a ∈ M with ka ∈ I for
some k ≥ 1. Then k[a] = [ka] = [∞] in M/I, and hence [a] = [∞] because M/I is reduced. Thus,
a ∈ I.
Lemma 2.3.8. If M is torsion-free, then so is M/I for every radical ideal I of M .
Proof. By Lemma 2.1.20, we only need to show that M/I is reduced, which is true by Lemma 2.3.7.

92

2 Ideal theory in commutative binoids

Proposition 2.3.9. The radical of an ideal I in a binoid M is the intersection of all prime ideals in
M containing I, namely

√

I = \I⊆P∈spec M

P .

In particular, the radical of an ideal I is the intersection of its minimal primes.
Proof. If I = M , the statement follows since the empty intersection is M . Therefore, let I 6= M .
For the inclusion ⊆ let a ∈ √I and P be a prime ideal containing I. Hence, there is an n ≥ 1 with
na ∈ I ⊆ P, but this implies a ∈ P by the prime property. Conversely, assume that a 6∈ √I. The
submonoid N := {na | n ∈ N} of M satisﬁes N ∩ I = ∅. Applying Lemma 2.2.24, we ﬁnd a prime
ideal P containing I with N ∩P = ∅. In particular, a 6∈ P, which therefore lies not in the intersection
of all prime ideals containing I.

Corollary 2.3.10. TP∈min(M) P = nil(M ) for every nonzero binoid M .
Proof. This is clear by Proposition 2.3.9 since nil(M ) =p{∞} is a radical ideal which is contained

in every prime ideal of M .

Corollary 2.3.11. Let M 6= {∞} be a reduced binoid. The following statements are equivalent:
(1) M is cancellative.
(2) M/P is cancellative for every P ∈ min M .
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) follows from Lemma 2.1.19. To show (2) ⇒ (1) suppose that a + b = a + c 6= ∞

but b 6= c for a, b, c ∈ M . Since M is reduced, we have TP∈min(M) P = {∞} by Corollary 2.3.10.

Thus, there is a minimal prime ideal P of M with a + b = a + c 6∈ P. This is equivalent to [a] + [b] =
[a] + [c] 6= [∞] in M/P, and implies [b] = [c] in M/P by the cancellativity. Since P is prime, the
elements b and c are not contained in P by the choice of P. Hence, b = c in M .
The condition of being reduced is necessary in the preceding corollary. As an example consider the
binoid

M := FC(x, y, z)/(2x = ∞, x + y = x + z) ,

which is neither reduced nor cancellative, but M/P is cancellative for all P ∈ min M = {hxi,hyi,hzi}.
Deﬁnition 2.3.12. A s u b d i r e c t p r o d u c t of a family (Mk)k∈I of binoids is a subbinoid M of their

product Qk∈I Mk such that πk(M ) = Mk for all k ∈ I, where πk denotes the canonical projection
Qi∈I Mi → Mk.

Corollary 2.3.13. Every reduced binoid M is a subdirect product of (M/P)P∈min M .
Proof. Clearly, if M is the zero binoid, then M is a subdirect product of the empty product. So let
M 6= {∞} and πP : M → M/P be the canonical projection for P ∈ min M . For the injectivity of

π = (πP )P∈min M : M −→ YP∈min M

M/P

assume that π(a) = π(b) for some a, b ∈ M . This means a ∼π b which is equivalent to πP (a) = πP (b)

for all P ∈ min M . Therefore, a = b or a, b ∈TP∈min M P. Now the injectivity follows from Corollary
2.3.10. In particular, M ∼= im π is a subbinoid ofQP∈min M M/P with πP (M ) = M/P.
Corollary 2.3.14. Let M be a binoid, I = spec M , ϕPQ : M/Q → M/P the canonical projection
for Q ⊆ P, and (M/P, (ϕPQ)Q⊆P )P,Q∈I the inverse system of integral quotient binoids considered in
Example 2.2.22. Then s - lim←− M/P ∼= Mred.

2.3 Minimal prime ideals

93

Proof. By Corollary 2.2.11, we may assume that M is reduced. First observe that every element in

lim←− M/P of the form ([a]P )P∈I , a ∈ M , is strongly compatible; here, [a]P denotes the image of a ∈ M
under the canonical projection M → M/P. Indeed, if [a]P , [a]Q 6= ∞, then a 6∈ P and a 6∈ Q, which
implies that a 6∈ P ∪ Q ∈ spec M , and hence ∞ 6= ϕP∪Q,P ([a]P ) = ϕP∪Q,Q([a]Q). In particular, there
is a well-deﬁned binoid homomorphism

φ : M −→ s - lim←−P∈I

M/P ,

a 7−→ ([a]P )P∈I .

We will show that φ is bijective to prove the statement. For the surjectivity assume that (cP )P∈I ∈
lim←− M/P is strongly compatible. Thus, if cP = [a]P ∈ (M/P)• and cP ′ = [b]P ′ ∈ (M/P ′)• , then
ϕQP ([a]P ) = ϕQP ′ ([b]P ′) 6= ∞ for some Q ⊇ P,P ′. This equivalent to a = b because all ϕQP , P ⊆ Q,
are the identity map on (M/P) \ ker ϕQP . The injectivity follows now from Corollary 2.3.13 since
([a]P )P∈I = ([b]P )P∈I for a, b ∈ M implies that ([a]P )P∈J = ([b]P )P∈J , where J := min M ⊆ I, hence
a = b.

3 Basic concepts of binoid algebras

Convention. Throughout this chapter, K denotes a ring and whenever we refer to the monoid or
binoid structure of a ring we mean the one deﬁned by the multiplication unless otherwise stated.

In this chapter, we turn to the algebras and modules associated to binoids, N - sets, and N - binoids.
Before deﬁning the binoid algebra, we recall needed facts on monoid algebras that translate to binoid
algebras. For instance, a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a binoid algebra being an integral
domain is given. The crucial correspondence of the sets of K - points of a binoid and its algebra, on
which we will focus in the next two chapters, is stated in Proposition 3.2.3. Some considerations on the
connection of the ideal theories of a binoid and its algebra are made in the third section. Finally, basic
notions and properties of modules and algebras associated to an N - sets and N - binoids, respectively,
are assembled in the last two sections.
We want to draw the attention to two observations made in this chapter. Example 3.2.7 demonstrates
that projective limits need not commute with K[−], and Example 3.4.9 showcases how easily one drops
out of the theory of monoid algebras while still remaining in the context of binoid algebras.

3.1 Monoid algebras

Deﬁnition 3.1.1. A K - a l g e b r a A is given by a not necessarily commutative ring A and a ring
homomorphism ϕ : K → A such that im ϕ lies in the center of A. The ring homomorphism ϕ is
called the s t r u c t u r e h o m o m o r p h i s m of the K - algebra A. A ring homomorphism A → A′ into
another K - algebra A′ is a K - a l g e b r a h o m o m o r p h i s m if it is compatible with the structure
homomorphisms of A and A′. The set HomK- alg(A, A′) of all K - algebra homomorphisms A → A′
will be denoted by K- Spec A when A′ = K.

We will now recall the deﬁnition of monoid algebras and list the basic results about them without
giving (detailed) proofs. As a reference, we cite [51], but proofs can also be found in [46] and (for
commutative monoids) in [28].

Deﬁnition 3.1.2. Let M be an arbitrary monoid. The m o n o i d a l g e b r a KM of M over K is the
associative K - algebra with K - left module basis T a ∈ M . The multiplication for these basis elements
is deﬁned by using the operation of M ,

T a · T b := T a+b

for a, b ∈ M , which is then extended distributively to a multiplication on KM . In case M is a group,
KM is called the g r o u p a l g e b r a of M over K.

The ring K is a subring of KM via the ring monomorphism K ֒→ KM , r 7→ rT 0. If K 6= 0, there
is a monoid embedding M ֒→ KM with a 7→ T a such that M can be considered as a submonoid of
KM . Every element f ∈ KM can be written uniquely as
raT a

f = Xa∈M

96

3 Basic concepts of binoid algebras

with ra ∈ K such that ra 6= 0 for only ﬁnitely many a ∈ M . Moreover, KM is an M - graded
K - algebra

KM = Ma∈M

KT a ,

where KT a := {rT a | r ∈ K}. The elements of the K - module KT a are called h o m o g e n e o u s of
d e g r e e a. The element 0 is of every degree by convention. Clearly, unless K = 0 the monoid algebra
KM is commutative if and only if M is commutative (and K, what we always assume).
Example 3.1.3. The polynomial algebra K[Xi | i ∈ I] ∼= K(N(I)) over K is a monoid algebra.
By the following proposition, the monoid algebra is a universal object and therefore unique up to
isomorphism.

Proposition 3.1.4. Given a K - algebra A and a monoid homomorphism φ : M → (A,·), there exists
a unique K - algebra homomorphism φ : KM → A with ˜φ(T a) = φ(a) for all a ∈ M .
Proof. See [51, Korollar 52.2].

Corollary 3.1.5. Let M be a monoid.
(1) Let α : K → L be a homomorphism of rings and ϕ : M → N a monoid homomorphism. Then

there is a unique ring homomorphism KM → LN with ra 7→ α(r)ϕ(a).

(2) If a is an ideal in K, then KM/aKM ∼= (K/a)M .
(3) If S is a multiplicative system in K, then (KM )S ∼= KSM .
(4) Given a ﬁnite family (Mi)i∈I of monoids, there is a canonical isomorphism

K KMi .

Mi(cid:17) ∼= Oi∈I

K(cid:16)Yi∈I
(5) If A is a K - algebra, then A ⊗K KM ∼= AM .
Proof. For a more precise demonstration see [51, §52, Beispiel 2,3 and 4], [51, §80, Beispiel 13], and
[51, §81, Beispiel 11]. Outline: the ﬁrst assertion is an easy consequence of the universal property
(Proposition 3.1.4). The second follows from (1) with N = M , ϕ = idM , and α = π : K → K/a.
Finally, one may easily derive that the three remaining isomorphisms are given by the canonical

KS - algebra homomorphism (Pa∈M raT a)/s 7→Pa∈M (ra/s)T a and by the two canonical K - algebra
homomorphisms T (ai)i∈I 7→ ⊗i∈I ai and b ⊗KPa∈M raT a 7→Pa∈M (rab)T a.

The following proposition determines under which conditions the monoid algebra contains no zero-
divisors.

Proposition 3.1.6. Let M be a monoid and K 6= 0. The monoid algebra KM is a domain if and
only if K is an integral domain and M ∞ is torsion-free and cancellative.

Proof. See [30, Theorem 8.1] or [11, Theorem 4.18].

3.2 Binoid algebras

For the sake of completeness, we recall the deﬁnition of the binoid algebra introduced at the beginning
of Section 1.1 (cf. page 10). Since we will encounter only commutative binoid algebras in the subsequent
chapters, two examples of non-commutative algebras that can be realized as binoid algebras are given
at the end of this section, namely matrix algebras and path algebras.

3.2 Binoid algebras

97

Deﬁnition 3.2.1. Let M be a binoid. The b i n o i d a l g e b r a of M is deﬁned to be the quotient
algebra

KM/(T ∞) =: K[M ] ,

where (T ∞) is the ideal in KM generated by the element T ∞. In general, if I is an ideal in M , we
will denote the ideal (resp. K - submodule) of KM generated by T a, a ∈ I, by

KI := (T a | a ∈ I) ⊆ KM

and by

the associated ideal (resp. K - submodule) of K[M ].

K[I] := KI/(T ∞) = (T a | a ∈ I) ⊆ K[M ]

By deﬁnition, K[M ] may be identiﬁed with the set of all formal sums Pa∈A raT a with A ⊆ M •

ﬁnite and ra ∈ K, where the multiplication is generated by

The K - module isomorphism

, otherwise.

KT a

gives rise to a graded K - algebra homomorphism

KM −→ K[M ]

with ker = KT ∞. In this vein, the binoid algebra K[M ] emerges from the monoid algebra KM by
glueing together the absorbing elements of M and KM . Thus, the notion of binoid algebras generalizes
that of monoid algebras. Given an ideal I ⊆ M , the ideals KI and K[I] are monomial ideals of KM
and K[M ], respectively. If K 6= 0, the composition M ֒→ KM → K[M ] yields a binoid embedding

ιM : M −→ K[M ] ,

a 7−→ T a ,

such that M can be considered as a subbinoid of (K[M ],·, 1, 0).
Example 3.2.2.
(1) For the zero binoid, we obtain K[{∞}] = 0 and for the trivial binoid K[{0,∞}] = K.
(2) If M is an integral binoid, then K[M ] ∼= KM • . In particular, K[M/M+] is the group algebra

KM ×, see also Corollary 3.2.8(3) bellow.

(3) The binoid algebras of the one-generated binoids, cf. Corollary 1.12.8, as well as those of some

two-generated binoids were described up to isomorphism in Section 1.12.

Proposition 3.2.3. Given a binoid M , a K - algebra A, and a binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → A,
there is a unique K - algebra homomorphism φ : K[M ] → A such that the diagram

3 Basic concepts of binoid algebras

In particular, if A = K, then

as semigroups.

K- spec M ∼= K- Spec K[M ]

Proof. Consider the composition of the canonical maps M → KM π→ K[M ]. By the universal property
of the monoid algebra, cf. Proposition 3.1.4, ϕ induces a K - algebra homomorphism ˜ϕ : KM → A
with rT a 7→ α(r)ϕ(a), where α : K → A is the structure homomorphism, r ∈ K, and a ∈ M . Since
ker π = KT ∞ ⊆ ker ˜ϕ, the K - algebra homomorphism ˜ϕ induces a ring homomorphism φ : K[M ] → A
with φπ = ˜ϕ such that rT a 7→ α(r)ϕ(a), r ∈ K, a ∈ M , which shows that φ is a K - algebra homo-
morphism.

The binoid algebra is uniquely determined by its universal property.

Corollary 3.2.4. Given a ring homomorphism α : K → L and a binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → M ′,
there is a unique ring homomorphism φ : K[M ] → L[M ′] with φ(rT a) = α(r)T ϕ(a), r ∈ K, a ∈ M • .
Proof. By Proposition 3.2.3, ϕ induces the K - algebra homomorphism ˜φ of the following commutative
diagram

M

ιM

K[M ]

ϕ

˜α /

/ L[M ′] .

Then φ = ˜α ˜φ is the unique ring homomorphism, where ˜α : rT a 7→ α(r)T a.
Remark 3.2.5. There are two special cases of Corollary 3.2.4.
(1) If ϕ = idM , there is a unique ring homomorphism α[M ] : K[M ] → L[M ]. It is easily veriﬁed
that every subset of L that generates L as a K - module (or K - algebra) generates L[M ] as
a K[M ] - module (or K[M ] - algebra), and that every linear independent set of elements of L
over K is linearly independent in L[M ] over K[M ]. In particular, bases retain unchanged while
switching to binoid algebras. Moreover, if α is surjective, then so is α[M ].

(2) The other specialization is when L = K . In this case there is a unique K - algebra (!) homo-

morphism

ϕ is injective or surjective if and only if K[ϕ] is so. In particular, K[−] is a covariant functor
from the category of binoids to the category of graded K - algebras.

K[ϕ] : K[M ] −→ K[N ] .

Example 3.2.6. Let M be a commutative binoid. By Corollary 2.3.13, there is an embedding M ֒→

QP ∈min M M/P for every reduced binoid M , which induces an injective K - algebra homomorphism
K[M ] → K(cid:2)QP ∈min M M/P(cid:3).

Example 3.2.7. Let ((Mi)i∈I , (ϕji)i≥j )i,j∈I be an inverse system of binoids. Then (Ai, (fji)i≥j )i,j∈I
with Ai := K[Mi] and fji := K[ϕji] : Ai → Aj deﬁnes an inverse system of K - algebras. The
projective limit

might but need not coincide with K[lim←− Mi]. However, there is always an embedding

lim←− K[Mi] = n(Fi)i∈I ∈Yi∈I

K[lim←− Mi] −→ lim←− K[Mi] ,

coming from the family gj : lim←− Mi → Mj → K[Mj], j ∈ I, of binoid homomorphisms which satisfy
fijgj = gi for all i, j ∈ I. Hence, there is a unique binoid embedding

that factors through K[lim←− Mi] by Proposition 3.2.3.

M is a commutative binoid, I = spec M , and ϕPQ : M/Q → M/P are the canonical projections for
Q ⊆ P. Returning to the two particular cases discussed there, we obtain the following:

Corollary 3.2.8. Let M be a binoid.

(1) If N is a subbinoid of M , the binoid algebra K[N ] is a K - subalgebra of K[M ].
(2) If a is an ideal in K, then (K/a)[M ] ∼= K[M ]/aK[M ].
(3) If M is commutative and I an ideal in M , then K[M/I] ∼= K[M ]/K[I] ∼= KM/KI.
(4) If M is commutative and S is a subbinoid of M , then eS := {T a | a ∈ S} deﬁnes a multiplicative

(6) If S is a multiplicative system in K, then K[M ]S ∼= KS[M ].

system in K[M ] and there is an isomorphism eS−1(K[M ]) ∼= K[MS].

Proof. (1) Is clear. Let π : K → K/a be the canonical surjection. The kernel of the induced
ring epimorphism K[π] : K[M ] → (K/a)[M ], cf. Corollary 3.2.4, consists of all f ∈ K[M ] with
coeﬃcients in a, which proves (2). (3) The binoid epimorphism M → M/I induces a K - algebra
homomorphism K[M ] → K[M/I] by Corollary 3.2.4. Its kernel is given byLa∈I • KT a = K[I], hence
K[M/I] ∼= K[M ]/K[I]. The latter isomorphism is clear. (4) By Corollary 3.2.4, the canonical map
ιS : M → MS induces a K - algebra homomorphism ˜ιS : K[M ] → K[MS]. Let ι : K[M ] → eS−1(K[M ])
denote the canonical ring homomorphism. Since ι(S) ⊆ (eS−1(K[M ]))×, there is by the universal

Corollary 3.2.9. Let I ⊆ M be an ideal and e ∈ I an idempotent element such that KI is a
K - algebra with identity e. Then ϕ : KM → KI × K[M/I] deﬁned by φ(x) = (ex, π(x)), where π :
KM → K[M/I] denotes the canonical homomorphism, is an isomorphism of algebras. In particular,
KM ∼= K × K[M ] as K - algebras.
Proof. By assumption, there is a K - algebra isomorphism KM ∼= KI × (1 − e)KM , and hence
(1 − e)KM ∼= KM/KI ∼= K[M/I] by Corollary 3.2.8. Since π((1 − e)x) = π(x) for every x ∈
KM and ker π ∩ (1 − e)KM = KI ∩ (1 − e)KM = 0, the restriction of π to (1 − e)KM is an
isomorphism (1 − e)KM ∼= K[M/I] from which the statement follows. The case I = KT ∞ proves
the supplement.

Theorem 3.2.10. The binoid algebra K[M ] is a domain if and only if K is a domain and M a
regular torsion-free binoid.
Proof. If K[M ] is a domain, the binoid M has to be integral; that is, K[M ] ∼= KM • . The theorem
follows now from Proposition 3.1.6.

Corollary 3.2.11. If M is a torsion-free binoid and K a domain, then K[M/M+] is a domain.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.2.10 since M/M+ = M ×∪{∞} is regular and,
by Lemma 2.3.8, torsion-free.

Here are two important examples of non-commutative algebras that can be realized as binoid algebras.

Example 3.2.12. (Matrix algebras) For V = {1, . . . , n}, n ≥ 1, let M = {ei,j | (i, j) ∈ V × V }∪{∞}
be the binoid with addition given by

ei,j + ek,l = (ei,l

Example 3.2.13. (Path algebras) A ﬁnite q u i v e r Q is a ﬁnite directed graph possibly with multiple
arrows and loops. In other words, Q = (V, A, s, t) is a quadruple consisting of the ﬁnite sets of vertices
V and arrows A between them, and two maps s, t : A → V , which associate to each arrow β ∈ A its
source s(β) ∈ V and its target t(β) ∈ V . Let a, b ∈ V be two vertices. A path from a to b in Q is a
sequence (a|β1 ··· βℓ|b), where βi ∈ A, i ∈ {1, . . . , ℓ}, with s(β1) = a and s(βi+1) = t(βi) for 1 ≤ i < ℓ,
and t(βℓ) = b, which may be brieﬂy denoted by (β1 ··· βℓ) or illustrated as follows

a = a0

β1−→ a1

β2−→ a2

β3−→ ···

βℓ−→ aℓ = b .

The number ℓ is called the length of (β1 ··· βℓ). Furthermore, we associate to each vertice a ∈ V a
stationary path at a of lenght zero, denoted by εa = (a||a). If Qℓ denotes the set of all paths of lengh
ℓ, then Q0 ∼= V and Q1 ∼= A. Let n = |A|. Consider the set

Mℓ = {(i1, . . . , iℓ) ∈ {1, . . . , n}ℓ | (βi1 ··· βiℓ) ∈ Qℓ} ∪ {∞}

of ℓ - tuples which belong to a path in Qℓ with ∞ adjoint. Tuples with no corresponding path in Q will
be identiﬁed with ∞. Such tuples do not exist if and only if A = {β} and s(β) = t(β). Otherwise,
the tuple ∞ has every length. It follows that

MQ := Mℓ≥0

Mℓ

is a binoid with respect to (i1, . . . , iℓ) ◦ (j1, . . . , jk) = (i1, . . . , iℓ, j1, . . . , jk) if this tuple belongs to a
path in Qℓ+k and ∞ otherwise. The corresponding binoid algebra
KXi1 ··· Xiℓ

K[MQ ] = M(i1,...,iℓ)∈M •

Q

is given by the quotient KhX1, . . . , Xni/KX ∞ of the free associative K - algebra with non-commuting
variables X1, . . . , Xn and KX ∞ = K( Xi1 ··· Xiℓ | (i1, . . . , iℓ) /∈ Mℓ, ℓ ≥ 0). If K[Q] denotes the path
algebra of Q with K - basis {(βi1 ··· βiℓ ) ∈ Qℓ | ℓ > 0}, then the natural map given by (βi1 ··· βik ) 7→
Xi1 ··· Xik is a K - algebra isomorphism

K[Q] ∼−→ K[MQ ] .

In case K is an algebraically closed ﬁeld, the preceding deﬁnition of the path algebra associated to a
quiver agrees with the classical one from representation theory ([7, Chapter 4]). It is a well-known fact

that K[Q] has a unit, namely 1K[Q] =Pa∈V εa, if and only if V is ﬁnite. In this case, {εa | a ∈ V } is

a complete set of primitive orthogonal idempotents for K[Q].

It might be useful to have another, slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition of a (ﬁnite) quiver changing this
situation. For this, let (V, A, s, t) as before, but instead of associating to each vertice a stationary
path, we consider only the empty (or totally stationary) path ∅ subject to the rule

∅β = β∅ = β

for all β ∈ A (i.e. Q0 = {∅}). Accordingly, we call a quiver deﬁned in this way a q u i v e r w i t h 1
(= ∅), and denote it by Q1. This deﬁnition makes even more sense when passing to the binoid algebra
of MQ1 because the unit element of the quiver coincides with the unit of the K - algebra K[Q1]. If
V = {a}, then Q = Q1 with 1 = εa.

3 Basic concepts of binoid algebras

3.3 Ideals in binoid algebras

Convention. In this section, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative.

Recall that every ideal I in a binoid M deﬁnes a monomial ideal in K[M ], namely

K[I] = Ma∈I

KT a .

Conversely, to each ideal a ⊆ K[M ] there is an ideal of exponents in M ,

I(a) := {a ∈ M | T a ∈ a} .

Lemma 3.3.1.
(1) Let I and J be two ideals in M .
(a) K[I ∪ J ] = K[I] + K[J ].
(b) K[I ∩ J ] = K[I] ∩ K[J ].
(c) K[I + J ] = K[I] · K[J ].

(2) K[I(a)] ⊆ a for every ideal a in K[M ]. Moreover, if a and b are monomial ideals in K[M ], then
(a) K[I(a)] = a. In particular, I(−) establishes a bijection between the set of ideals of M and
the set of monomial ideals of K[M ] with inverse K[−], namely I 7→ K[I] and I(a) ←[ a.

(b) b ⊆ a if and only if I(b) ⊆ I(a).
(c) If a is a radical ideal then so is I(a).

Proof. All assertions are easily veriﬁed.

Proposition 3.3.2. Let K be a ﬁeld. If M is positive, then K[M+] is a maximal ideal in K[M ].
Proof. We have K ∼= K[{0,∞}] = K[M/M+] = K[M ]/K[M+], where the latter identity is due to

Corollary 3.2.8(3).

This result fails for non-positive binoids. As an easy example consider the binoid group M =

(Z/nZ)∞ with n ≥ 2. Then K[M ]/K[M+] = K[M/M+] = K[M ] ∼= K[X]/(X n − 1) is not a ﬁeld
since X − 1 is a zero-divisor. In particular, K[M+] = K[{∞}] = 0 is not a maximal ideal in K[M ].
Corollary 3.3.3. Let K be a ﬁeld. If M is ﬁnitely generated and positive, then

dimK K[M ]/(K[M+])n = H(n, M ) .1

Proof. We have

K[M ]/(K[M+])n = K[M ]/K[nM+] = K[M/nM+] = Ma∈(M/nM+)•

KT a

as K - vector spaces, hence dimK K[M ]/(K[M+])n = #(M/nM+) − 1 = H(n, M ).
Proposition 3.3.4. Let M be a binoid. If p ∈ spec K[M ], then I(p) ∈ spec(M ). In particular, every
monomial prime ideal in K[M ] is of the form K[P] for some prime ideal P ∈ spec M . Conversely, if
M is torsion-free and regular, P ∈ spec M , and K a domain, then K[P] is a (monomial) prime ideal
in K[M ].

1Here, we use the convention a0 := R for an ideal a in a ring R.

3.4 K[N ] - modules

103

Proof. Let p ∈ spec K[M ] and a, b ∈ M with a+b ∈ I(p). Then T a+b = T a·T b ∈ p, which implies that
T a ∈ p or T b ∈ p by the prime property. Hence, a ∈ I(p) or b ∈ I(p). This shows that I(p) is prime.
The additional observation follows now from Lemma 3.3.1(2a). Conversely, if P is a prime ideal, then
M/P is integral and again torsion-free and cancellative by Lemma 2.1.19 and Lemma 2.1.20. Hence,
K[M/P] ∼= K[M ]/K[P] is a domain by Theorem 3.2.10, which implies that K[P] ∈ spec K[M ].
Corollary 3.3.5. Let K be a domain and M a torsion-free cancellative binoid. If p is a minimal
prime ideal of K[M ], then I(p) is a minimal prime in M .
Proof. By Proposition 3.3.4, only the minimality of I(p) needs to be veriﬁed. So suppose that Q ⊆ M
is a prime ideal with Q ( I(p). Then K[Q] ∈ spec K[M ] by Proposition 3.3.4 with K[Q] ( K[I(p)] =
p, which contradicts the minimality of p. Hence, I(p) is a minimal prime ideal.

3.4 K[N ] - modules

The concept of binoid algebras for binoids can be generalized to arbitrary N - sets (S, p); that is, to
every N - set (S, p) one can associate a K[N ] - module K[S]. The following deﬁnition of K[S] suggests
what the subsequent two results show: many of the results on binoid algebras given in Section 3.2 can
be generalized to N - sets and their associated K[N ] - modules since every binoid is a {0,∞} - set. In
this thesis, the results are not needed in their more general module theoretic form, but rather as they
are stated in Section 3.2 for binoid algebras. However, there is a purely module theoretic result, cf.
Proposition 3.4.7, even when the N - sets are given by binoids (i.e. N = {0,∞}). We close this section
by applying this result to an important example, the blowup binoid.

Deﬁnition 3.4.1. For an N - set (S, p) let K[S] denote the K[N ] - module given by the set of all

formal sumsPs∈T rsX s with T ⊆ S • ﬁnite, rs ∈ K, and scalar multiplication deﬁned by

raX a · rsX s :=(rarsX a+s

0

, if a + s 6= p ,
, otherwise,

where a ∈ N and s ∈ S.
Example 3.4.2.
(1) The ideal K[I] is a K[M ] - module that can be understood as coming from the M - set (I,∞).
(2) Let Q ⊆ Zd be a submonoid and F a proper ﬁlter of Q∞. We consider the subset

F − Q = {f − q | f ∈ F, q ∈ Q}

of Zd, and its translates a + F − Q for a ∈ Zd. The pointed set Ma := (a + F − Q)∞ is a Q∞ - set
with respect to the operation Q∞ × Ma −→ Ma,

(q, u) 7−→(q + u , if q + u ∈ Ma ,

, otherwise.

∞

The set F − Q is called the injective hull of the ﬁlter F , and the K[Q∞] - module K[Ma] an
indecomposable injective of Q, cf. [41, Deﬁnition 11.7].

Lemma 3.4.3. S is a ﬁnitely generated N - set if and only if K[S] is a ﬁnitely generated K[N ] - module.

Proof. This is clear.

104

3 Basic concepts of binoid algebras

Every K[N ] - module V is also an N - set with respect to the (left) operation of N on (V, 0) given by

N × V −→ V ,

(a, v) 7−→ a + v := X a · v .

In particular, K[S] is again an N - set for every N - set (S, p), and unless K = 0 there is a canonical
injective N - map

ιS : S −→ K[S] ,

s 7−→ X s .

The associated K[N ] - module of an N - set is a universal object and therefore unique up to isomor-
phism.

Proposition 3.4.4. Let (S, p) be an N - set and V a K[N ] - module. Every N - map ϕ : (S, p) → (V, 0)
gives rise to a unique K[N ] - module homomorphism φ : K[S] → V such that the diagram

is a well-deﬁned K - module homomorphism with φιS = ϕ. To verify that φ is also a homomorphism
of K[N ] - modules observe that ϕ(a + s) = a + ϕ(s) = X a · ϕ(s) for all a ∈ N and s ∈ S. Therefore, if

Proof. The map φ deﬁned by φ(Ps∈T rsX s) :=Ps∈T rsϕ(s) with rs ∈ K, s ∈ T , and T ⊆ S • ﬁnite,

Corollary 3.4.5. Given an N - map ϕ : S → T of N - sets (S, p) and (T, q), there exists a unique

with ϕ 7→ K[ϕ], where EndK K[S] denotes the ring of all K - module homomorphisms K[S] → K[S]
and 0K[S] the zero map.

K[ϕ ◦ ψ] = K[ϕ] ◦ K[ψ], K[idS] = idK[S], and K[ϕ∞] = 0K[S], which implies the supplement.
Proposition 3.4.6. Let (S, p) be an N - set. K[S] is a K[N ] - module such that there is a commutative

where ϕ is a binoid homomorphism and φ a ring homomorphism.
Proof. The operation N × S → S, (a, s) 7→ a + s, induces a canonical operation K[N ]× K[S] → K[S]
generated by (raT a, rsT s) 7→ rarsT a+s. Thus, there is a ring homomorphism φ : K[N ] → EndK K[S]
with F 7→ (φ(F ) : G 7−→ G · F ), which makes the diagram commutative.
Proposition 3.4.7. Given a family (Si, pi)i∈I of N - sets, there is a K[N ] - module isomorphism:

Kh[·

Sii ∼= Mi∈I

K[Si] .

Proof. By Corollary 3.4.5, the family (ϕi)i∈I of injective N - maps Si ֒→S· i∈I Si =: S with s 7→ (s; i),

i ∈ I, induces a family ιi : K[Si] → K[S], i ∈ I, of K[N ] - module homomorphisms, which gives rise
to a K[N ] - module homomorphism

φ :Mi∈I

K[Si] −→ K[S]

ψ : K[S] −→Mi∈I

K[Si]

with φ((Fi)i∈I ) =Pi∈I ιi(Fi), cf. [51, Satz 39.1]. On the other hand, the surjections S → Si, i ∈ I,

with (s; k) 7→ (s; i) if k = i and pi otherwise, yield by Corollary 3.4.5 K[N ] - module homomorphisms
K[S] → K[Si], i ∈ I, which induce a K[N ] - module homomorphism

withPa∈A raX a 7→Pi∈IPa∈Si∩A raX a, where A ⊆S· i∈I Si is a ﬁnite set. It is easily checked that

φ and ψ are inverse to each other.

Remark 3.4.8. For a binoid M and an ideal I ⊆ M deﬁne the b l o w u p b i n o i d RI of I to be the
pointed union of the family (nI,∞)n≥0 of pointed sets, i.e.
nI ,

RI := [·

n≥0

with addition deﬁned by

(f ; n) + (g; m) := (f + g; n + m) .

The identity element is then given by (0; 0) and the absorbing element by the element that arises by
glueing the elements (∞; n), n ≥ 0, together. Thus, RI is generated by M = 0 · I and I = 1 · I, and
can be considered as a subbinoid of M ∧ N∞ with respect to (a; n) 7→ a ∧ n. By Proposition 3.4.7, it
follows that the binoid algebra of the blowup binoid

every n ≥ 0 and RI is an M - binoid via the embedding M ֒→ RI , a 7→ (a; 0). Hence, we have a

called the a s s o c i a t e d g r a d e d b i n o i d of the binoid M with respect to the ideal I ⊆ M . The

grK[M](K[M+]) = K[RM+ ] ⊗K[M] K ,

where K is a K[M ] - algebra with respect to K[M ] → K, T a 7→ 1 if a = 0 and 0 otherwise.

3.5 Binoid algebras of N - binoids

Convention. In this section, N always denotes a commutative binoid.

By Remark 3.2.5(2), the structure homomorphism ϕ : N → M of an N - binoid M induces a ring
homomorphism K[ϕ] : K[N ] → K[M ]. This deﬁnes a K[N ] - algebra structure on K[M ].
Corollary 3.5.1. Every homomorphism ϕ : M → M ′ of N - binoids induces a unique K[N ] - algebra
homomorphism φ : K[M ] → K[M ′] with φ(rT a) = rT ϕ(a), r ∈ K, a ∈ M • .
Proof. This is clear by Corollary 3.2.4 (with K = L and α = idK) and the commutative diagram

3 Basic concepts of binoid algebras

Corollary 3.5.3. If M is a ﬁnitely generated commutative N - binoid, then K[M ] is a ﬁnitely gener-
ated K[N ] - algebra.

Proof. Let {x1, . . . , xr} be a generating set of M . By Remark 3.2.5(2) and Corollary 3.5.2, the binoid
epimorphism

a ∧ (n1, . . . , nr) 7→ ϕ(a) + n1x1 + ··· + nrxr, induces a K - algebra epimorphism

ϕ : N ∧ (Nr)∞ −→ M ,

K[ϕ] : K[N ][X1, . . . , Xr] −→ K[M ] ,

with rT aX ν 7→ rT ϕ(a)X ν, ν = (n1, . . . , nr). Obviously, K[ϕ] is a K[N ] - algebra homomorphism. This
proves the statement.

Remark 3.5.4.

(1) The supplement of Corollary 3.5.2 can be obtained from earlier results when taking extra as-
sumptions on the binoids into account. If, for instance, M and M ′ are integral, then M ∧ M ′ ∼=
(M •× M ′• )∞ by Lemma 1.8.8(3). Therefore,

K[M ∧ M ′] ∼= K(M •× M ′• )
∼= KM •⊗K KM ′•
∼= K[M ] ⊗K K[M ′] ,

where the isomorphism in the middle is due to Corollary 3.1.5(4). However, for arbitrary (not
necessarily integral) commutative binoids this also follows from Corollary 3.2.8(3) since M∧M ′ ∼=
(M × M ′)/I with I = {(a, b) | a = ∞ or b = ∞}, which yields

K[M ∧ M ′] ∼= K(M × M ′)/(T c | c ∈ I)

∼= (KM ⊗K KM ′)/(KT ∞ ⊗K KM ′ + KM ⊗K KT ∞)
∼= (KM/(T ∞)) ⊗K (KM ′/(T ∞))
∼= K[M ] ⊗K K[M ′] .

The isomorphism K[(M × M ′)/I] ∼= K[M ] ⊗K K[M ′] can already be found in [46, Chapter 4,
Lemma 10].

(2) Corollary 3.5.2 has shown that the tensor product of binoid algebras comes from the smash

product of the involved binoids, while for the product we get

K[M × M ′] = K(M × M ′)/(T (∞,∞))

∼= KM ⊗K KM ′/(U ∞ ⊗K V ∞) ,

cf. Corollary 3.1.5(4). By Proposition 3.2.3, there is a commutative diagram

while T (0,0) 6= T (0,∞) + T (∞,0).

(3) The natural binoid epimorphisms π∧ : M × M ′ → M ∧ M ′ and π∪:

Remark 1.9.6, induce by Corollary 3.2.4 the K - algebra epimorphisms

: M ∧ M ′ → M ∪: M ′, cf.

K[M × M ′]

K[π∧]

−→ K[M ∧ M ′]

K[π∪: ]
−→ K[M ∪: M ′] .

If M and M ′ are commutative, then M ∪: M ′ = (M ∧ M ′)/J with J = {a ∧ a′ | a 6= 0 and
a′ 6= 0}, cf. Example 2.1.18. By Corollary 3.2.8(3), this gives

K[M ∪: M ′] = K[M ] ⊗K K[M ′]/(U a ⊗ V a′

| a, a′ 6= 0) .

Example 3.5.5. We apply the results of the preceding remark to M = M ′ = N∞. This yields the
following K - algebra isomorphisms:

K[N∞ × N∞] = KN∞ ⊗K KN∞/(U ∞ ⊗K V ∞)

∼= (K × K[X]) ⊗K (K × K[Y ])/((1, 0) ⊗ (1, 0))
∼= K[X] × K[Y ] × K[X, Y ]
K[N∞ ∧ N∞] ∼= K[X] ⊗K K[Y ] ∼= K[X, Y ]
K[N∞ ∪: N∞] ∼= K[X] ⊗K K[Y ]/(X ⊗ Y ) ∼= K[X, Y ]/(XY ) ,

where K[X], K[Y ], and K[X, Y ] denote the polynomial rings with indeterminates X and/or Y .

4 Topology of commutative binoids

In this chapter, we investigate the spectrum and the K - spectrum, K a ﬁeld, of a commutative binoid
as topological spaces. The topology on the spectrum is deﬁned analogous to the Zariski topology
on the spectrum of a ring. All results resemble those from ring theory, and the same applies to the
dimension theory of binoids, with which we deal in the third section. We introduce the booleanization
of a binoid M , which is a fairly easier binoid to study, and show that its spectrum is homeomorphic to
that of M . Similar to a result on characters of semigroups, we give a criterion when the K - points of a
binoid M separate the elements of M , cf. Proposition 4.4.11. The topology on K- spec M comes from
that on K- Spec K[M ], and the description of its properties will be continued in the next chapter. Here
we mainly focus on connectedness properties, in particular of hypersurfaces, and show that K- spec M
is the union of its cancellative components, which serve as the key tool to prove our main criterion for
connectedness, cf. Theorem 4.5.2.

Convention. In this chapter, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative unless otherwise
stated.

4.1 Spectrum

In this section, we deﬁne a topology on the spectrum of a binoid M similar to the Zariski topology
on the spectrum of a ring R. An excellent description of the latter can be found in [47, Chapter 3.A],
which we will partly follow since many results translate directly to binoids and their spectra. The
reader may also consult [31, Chapter I §1], [42, Chapter II §1], or [9, Chapter II §4.1] for spectra of
rings. The spectrum of a binoid equipped with the Zariski topology and its subspace consisting of all
minimal prime ideals have been studied in detail in [37]. See also [19].
Recall, cf. Section 2.2, that the semibinoid (spec M,∪, M+) is a binoid with identity element {∞}
if M is integral. However, one can always turn (spec M,∪, M+) into a binoid by adjoining {∅} as an
identity element irrespectively of the integrality of M .

Deﬁnition 4.1.1. Let M be binoid. The commutative binoid (spec M ∪ {∅},∪,∅, M+) is called the
e x t e n d e d s p e c t r u m of M , which will be denoted by spec∅ M .
Corollary 4.1.2. For M 6= {∞}, the boolean binoids spec∅ M , M v , and F (M )∩ are isomorphic.
Proof. Extending the maps from Corollary 2.2.6 to these binoids by (χM =) α∅ ↔ ∅ ↔ M gives the
well-deﬁned isomorphisms.

Deﬁnition 4.1.3. For a subset A ⊆ M let

The complements in spec M and spec∅ M are denoted by

V(A) := {P ∈ spec M | A ⊆ P} .

and D∅(A) := spec∅ M \ V(A) = D(A) ∪ {∅} .
D(A) := spec M \ V(A) = {P ∈ spec M | A 6⊆ P}
If A = {f}, we shall write V(f ) instead of V({f}) and the same for the complements D(f ) and D∅(f ).

112

4 Topology of commutative binoids

Lemma 4.1.4. Let M be a binoid, f, g ∈ M , and A, Ai, B ⊆ M , i ∈ I, subsets.

(1) Ti∈I V(Ai) = V(Si∈I Ai).

(2) V(f ) ∪ V(g) = V(f + g).
(3) If A ⊆ B, then V(B) ⊆ V(A).
(4) V(f ) = ∅ if and only if f ∈ M ×.
(5) V(f ) = spec M if and only if f is nilpotent.

(6) V(A) = V(MhAi) = V(pMhAi).
Proof. (1)-(4) are straightforward and (5) follows immediatley from Corollary 2.3.10. (6) Set MhAi =:
A. We always have A ⊆ A ⊆ √A, and hence V(√A) ⊆ V(A) ⊆ V(A) by (3). For the other inclusions,
it suﬃces to show that V(A) ⊆ V(√A). Given P ∈ V(A), we have to verify that √A ⊆ P. So let
f ∈ √A. This means nf ∈ A for some n ≥ 1, which implies that nf = a + m with a ∈ A ⊆ P and
m ∈ M . In particular, nf ∈ P, and therefore f ∈ P by the prime property.
By taking complements, Lemma 4.1.4 translates to:

Lemma 4.1.5. Let M be a binoid, f, g ∈ M , and A, Ai, B ⊆ M , i ∈ I, subsets.

(1) Si∈I D(Ai) = D(Si∈I Ai).

(2) D(f ) ∩ D(g) = D(f + g).
(3) If A ⊆ B, then D(A) ⊆ D(B).
(4) D(f ) = spec M if and only if f ∈ M ×.
(5) D(f ) = ∅ if and only if f is nilpotent.

(6) D(A) = D(MhAi) = D(pMhAi).

Proof. All statements are immediate consequences of Lemma 4.1.4.

The preceding lemmata show that spec M and spec∅ M are topological spaces for every binoid M ,
where the closed sets are given by V(A), A ⊆ M .
In either case this topology will be called the
Z a r i s k i t o p o l o g y . The complements D(A) and D∅(A) are the open sets, where (D(f ))f ∈M and
(D∅(f ))f ∈M deﬁne a basis of open sets of the Zariski topology on spec M and spec∅ M , respectively.
From now on, when we consider the (extended) spectrum of a binoid as a topological space, we mean
the (extended) spectrum together with the Zariski topology.

Remark 4.1.6.
(1) There are two natural topologies on a ﬁnite poset (X,⊆): the lower topology, where the open

sets are given by the subset-closed sets of X. In other words,

D ⊆ X open

:⇔ (A ∈ D and B ⊆ A ⇒ B ∈ D)

(which means that the closed sets are given by the superset-closed sets), and the upper topology,
where the open sets are given by the superset-closed sets of X. In other words,

D ⊆ X open

:⇔ (A ∈ D and A ⊆ B ⇒ B ∈ D) .

Thus, if spec M is a ﬁnite set, for instance when M is ﬁnitely generated, then the Zariski topology
on spec M coincides with the lower topology on (spec M,⊆).

(2) By Corollary 2.2.6, spec M and F (M ) \ {M} are isomorphic as semigroups by taking the com-
plements. Hence, considering a topology on spec M or on F (M ) is essentially the same. Those
topological spaces that arise as the ﬁltrum of a commutative monoid have been characterized in
[10, Satz 2.3.2].

4.1 Spectrum

113

(3) When dealing with monoids the empty set is usually considered as a prime ideal to ensure that
the spectrum is never empty, which were the case if M is a group. By this convention, the set of
all minimal prime ideals of M is always a singleton. In particular, the spectrum admits always a
unique generic point and is irreducible, cf. [45, Chapter 1.4], which still holds true if one adjoins
an absorbing element to the monoid, cf. Corollary 4.1.17.

Corollary 4.1.7. Let M be a binoid.
(1) If I is an ideal in M , then

spec(M/I) ∼= V(I) ⊆ spec M .

(2) If S ⊆ M is a submonoid of M , then

spec MS ∼= {P ∈ spec M | P ∩ S = ∅} .

If, in addition, S can be generated by a ﬁnite set A ⊆ S, then
spec MS ∼= D(f ) ⊆ spec M ,

where f =Pg∈A g. In particular, spec Mf = D(f ) for every f ∈ M .

(3) The following statements are equivalent for P ∈ spec M :

(a) MP = Mf for some f ∈ M .
(b) spec MP = D(f ) for some f ∈ M .
(c) spec MP is open in spec M .

Proof. (1) and the ﬁrst part of (2) are just restatements of Corollary 2.2.10 and Corollary 2.2.17. If
S is generated by the ﬁnite set A ⊆ S, we obtain from the ﬁrst part and Lemma 4.1.5(2) that

spec MS ∼= {P ∈ spec M | g 6∈ P for all g ∈ A} = \g∈A

D(g) = D(f )

with f = Pg∈A g. (3) The implication (a) ⇒ (b) is clear by (2), and (b) ⇒ (c) is trivial. So let
spec MP be open in spec M . Then there is a subset B ⊆ M such that spec MP = D(B) =Sf ∈B D(f ).

On the other hand, spec MP = {Q ∈ spec M | Q ⊆ P} by (2). Hence, P ∈ D(f ) for some f ∈ B, but
then spec MP ⊆ D(f ), which implies that spec MP = D(f ).
The equivalences of the following proposition will become very useful in Section 4.2.

Proposition 4.1.8. Let M be a binoid and f, g ∈ M . The following statements are equivalent:
(1) V(g) ⊆ V(f ).
(2) D(f ) ⊆ D(g).
(3) Filt(g) ⊆ Filt(f ).

(4) nf = g + x for some n ∈ N and x ∈ M ; that is, Mhfi ⊆pMhgi.

In particular, for a boolean binoid M , one has D(f ) = D(g) if and only if f = g.

Proof. Clearly, (1) and (2) are equivalent. So assume that D(f ) ⊆ D(g) for f, g ∈ M . By taking
complements of the prime ideals in these basic open sets, we get

F := {H ∈ F (M ) | f ∈ H} ⊆ {H ∈ F (M ) | g ∈ H} =: G ,

which implies that Filt(g) =TH∈G H ⊆TH∈F H = Filt(f ). Thus, (3) follows from (2). The implica-

tion (3) ⇒ (4) was observed in Remark 1.4.37. (4) ⇒ (1) is obvious. The if part of the supplement is

114

4 Topology of commutative binoids

trivial (and holds for arbitrary binoids). So let M be boolean and D(f ) = D(g) for some f, g ∈ M . By
the equivalence of (2) and (4), there are elements x, y ∈ M with f = g + x and g = f + y. It follows

f = f + f = f + g + x = f + g + g + x = f + g + f = f + g

and by symmetry g = f + g. Thus, f = g.

Remark 4.1.9. If A is a subset such that Filt(A), which is the smallest ﬁlter containing A, is a
proper ﬁlter, then M \ Filt(A) =: PA is a prime ideal in M with A 6⊆ PA. Since every prime ideal
is the complement of a (proper) ﬁlter by Corollary 2.2.6, PA is the largest prime ideal with A 6⊆ PA.

Therefore, PA ∈ D(A) and P ⊆ PA for every P ∈ D(A), or in other words PA =SP∈D(A) P.
Lemma 4.1.10. Let U ⊆ spec M be an open set, P,P ′ ∈ spec M , and f ∈ M .
(1) If P ∈ U , then P ′ ⊆ P implies P ′ ∈ U .
(2) M \ Filt(f ) ∈ U if and only if D(f ) ⊆ U .
(3) If D(f ) ⊆Si∈I Ui is an open cover, then D(f ) ⊆ Ui for one i ∈ I.

Proof. (1) Since U is open, there is an A ⊆ M such that U = D(A) = {P ∈ spec M | A 6⊆ P}. Then
A 6⊆ P ′ if P ′ ⊆ P ∈ U . The assertions (2) and (3) are clear if f is nilpotent, since then D(f ) = ∅
and V(f ) = M by Lemma 4.1.5(5) and Lemma 4.1.4(5). On the other hand, if f 6∈ nil(M ), then
Filt(f ) 6= M . By Remark 4.1.9, D(f ) = {P ∈ spec M | P ⊆ Q}, where Q := M \ Filt(f ). This proves
(2) and (3).

Corollary 4.1.11. Let M be a binoid. The spaces spec M and spec∅ M are quasi-compact and, if
M 6= {∞}, connected. Moreover, the Zariski topology satisﬁes the separation axiom T0.
Proof. The ﬁrst two properties are immediate consequences of Lemma 4.1.10(3) using the identiﬁca-
tions spec M = D(0) and spec∅ M = D∅(0). To show the separation axiom let P,Q ∈ spec M with
P 6= Q. Choose f ∈ P with f 6∈ Q. Then D(f ) is an open neighborhood of Q with P 6∈ D(f ). This
also proves the statement for spec∅ M .

For a subset E in a topological space X, the c l o s u r e E of E with respect to the topology on X is
the smallest closed subset of X containing E. In spec M , there is an easy description of these closures.

Deﬁnition 4.1.12. Given a subset E ⊆ spec M , we denote the idealTP∈E P by J(E).

Proposition 4.1.13. E = V(J(E)) for every subset E ⊆ spec M .
Proof. For the inclusion ⊆, take an arbitrary P ∈ E. By deﬁnition, we have J(E) ⊆ P, which implies
that V(P) ⊆ V(J(E)) by Lemma 4.1.4(3). Now the inclusion follows since P ∈ V(P). For the other
inclusion, we need to show that every closed subset V ⊆ spec M with E ⊆ V contains V(J(E)). If
V ⊆ spec M is a closed subset, then V = V(I) for some ideal I ⊆ M . If, in addition, E ⊆ V , then
I ⊆ P for all P ∈ E. Hence, I ⊆ J(E). Now V(J(E)) ⊆ V follows from Lemma 4.1.4(3).
Since the intersection of radical ideals is again a radical ideal, J(E) is a radical ideal for every
E ⊆ spec M . Proposition 2.3.9 now translates to:
Corollary 4.1.14. J(V(I)) = √I for every ideal I ⊆ M .

In particular, the inclusion reversing

assignments

are inverse bijections between the closed subsets of spec M and the radical ideals of M .

A 7−→ J(A)

and V(I) ←−[ I

Proof. The equality is just a restatement of Proposition 2.3.9 and implies I 7→ V(I) 7→ J(V(I)) = I.
Conversely we have A 7→ J(A) 7→ V(J(A)) = A by Proposition 4.1.13.

4.1 Spectrum

115

Recall that a topological space X is called i r r e d u c i b l e if X 6= ∅ and any two nonempty open
subsets of X intersect. Equivalently, X 6= ∅ and X is not the union of two proper closed subsets
of X. If X is an irreducible topological space with X = {x}, x ∈ X, then x is called a g e n e r i c
p o i n t of X. A maximal irreducible subset of a topological space X with respect to ⊆ is called an
i r r e d u c i b l e c o m p o n e n t of X. To study the irreducible subsets and components of spec M , we
need the following results.

Lemma 4.1.15. Let X be a topological space.
(1) A subset Y ⊆ X is irreducible if and only if its closure Y is irreducible.
(2) Every irreducible subset of X is contained in an irreducible component of X.

Proof. See [47, Proposition 3.A.10 and Proposition 3.A.13].

The ﬁrst statement of Lemma 4.1.15 shows that every irreducible component of X is closed, and
by the second, we have that X is the union of its components since every point {x}, x ∈ X, of a
topological space X is irreducible. The description of the irreducible components of spec M follows
from the next result.

Proposition 4.1.16. The closed irreducible subsets of spec M are the sets V(P), P ∈ spec M . In
particular, every closed irreducible subset of spec M has a unique generic point.

Proof. The irreducibility of V(P) follows from Lemma 4.1.15 since every point in a topological space
is irreducible. Conversely, we have to show that every closed irreducible subset is of this form. If E is
such a subset of spec M , then E = V(I) 6= ∅ for a radical ideal I 6= M by Corollary 4.1.14. To verify
the prime property of I assume that f + g ∈ I for some f, g ∈ M . If P is a prime ideal containing
I, then hfi ∪ I ⊆ P or hgi ∪ I ⊆ P. Thus, V(I) = V(hfi ∪ I) ∪ V(hgi ∪ I), which implies that

V(I) = V(hfi ∪ I) or V(I) = V(hgi ∪ I) by the irreducibility of V(I). Hence, √I = phfi ∪ I or
√I =phgi ∪ I by Corollary 4.1.14. Thus, f ∈ I or g ∈ I. This proves that I is a prime ideal. By

Proposition 4.1.13, V(P) = V(J({P})) = {P}, which shows that the closed irreducible subset V(P)
has a generic point.

Corollary 4.1.17. The irreducible components of spec M are given by the sets V(P) with P ∈ min M .
Proof. This is clear by Proposition 4.1.16 and Lemma 4.1.4(3).

By Corollary 2.2.8, every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N induces a map ϕ∗ : spec N → spec M
with P 7→ ϕ−1(P). This signiﬁcant, albeit elementary result translates to the category Top of topo-
logical spaces.

Proposition 4.1.18. Given a binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N , the induced semigroup homomor-
phism ϕ∗ : spec N → spec M , P 7→ ϕ−1(P), is continuous, namely

(ϕ∗)−1(D(A)) = D(ϕ(A))

and (ϕ∗)−1(V(A)) = V(ϕ(A))

for all A ⊆ M . In particular, spec : comB → Top is a contravariant functor from the category of
commutative binoids into the category of topological spaces.

Proof. To prove that ϕ∗ is continuous, it suﬃces to consider the basic open sets D(f ), f ∈ M , of the
topology. For such a set, we obtain (ϕ∗)−1(D(f )) = {P ∈ spec N | ϕ−1(P) ∈ D(f )}. This proves the
ﬁrst equality because ϕ−1(P) ∈ D(f ) is equivalent to ϕ(f ) 6∈ P by the deﬁnition of D(f ). The second
identity for the closed subsets follows by taking complements.

116

4 Topology of commutative binoids

Corollary 4.1.19. If ϕ : M → N is binoid epimorphism, the semigroup homomorphism ϕ∗ :
spec N → spec M is a continuous embedding on im ϕ∗ ⊆ V(ker ϕ). If N = M/I for an ideal I ⊆ M ,
then spec M/I ∼= V(I) a semigroups and as topological spaces, where V(I) carries the induced subspace
topology.

Proof. The continuous embedding ϕ∗ is given by Proposition 4.1.18. Since ker ϕ ⊆ ϕ−1(P) = ϕ∗(P)
for all P ∈ spec N , we have im ϕ∗ ⊆ V(ker ϕ). The statement for the special case N = M/I for an
ideal I ⊆ M , and ϕ = π : M → M/I follows from Corollary 2.2.10.
Example 4.1.20. Let M be a binoid.
(1) The semigroup isomorphism spec M ∼= spec Mred given in Corollary 2.2.11 can also be deduced
from Corollary 4.1.19 since Mred = M/ nil(M ), cf. Example 2.1.18, and V(nil(M )) = spec M
by Lemma 4.1.4. Furthermore, this is an isomorphism of topological spaces by Corollary 4.1.19.
Similarly, we obtain spec Mint ∼= V(intc(M )) as semigroups and as topological spaces from the
identiﬁcation Mint = M/ intc(M ).

(2) Let N be an integral binoid. Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N factors through M/Q,
where Q is the prime ideal ker ϕ = ϕ−1({∞N}). In particular, ϕ factors through every minimal
prime ideal P ⊆ Q, which implies that ϕ∗ : spec N → spec M factors through the irreducible
component π∗

P (spec M/P) = V(P) of spec M since

(3) Let M 6= {∞}. If M is reduced, there is a binoid embedding M →QP∈min M M/P by Corollary

2.3.13. In other words, two elements of a reduced binoid M coincide if and only if they coincide
on every irreducible component of M .

4.2 Booleanization

In this section, we introduce the booleanization of a binoid M which can be deﬁned for all, not
necessarily commutative, binoids and is in either case a universal object. However, for a commutative
binoid M , the booleanization has an explicit realization in terms of the basic open sets D(f ), f ∈ M ,
of the Zariski topology on spec M , which we described at the end of the last section.
For the moment we consider not necessarily commutative binoids but return very soon to the com-
mutative situation.

Deﬁnition 4.2.1. Let M be an arbitrary (not necessarily commutative) binoid and ∼bool the con-
gruence generated by

f ∼bool f + f

for f ∈ M . The binoid M/∼bool=: Mbool together with the canonical projection πbool : M → Mbool
is called the b o o l e a n i z a t i o n of M .

If X is a generating set of the (not necessarily commutative) binoid M , then every element f ∈ M
can be written as f = n1x1 + ··· + nrxr with (x1, x2, . . . , xr) ∈ X r, ni ≥ 1, i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, r ∈ N, such
that xi 6= xi+1 for i ∈ {1, . . . , r − 1}. Then πbool(f ) = x1 + ··· + xr.
The booleanization is a universal object as the following proposition shows.

Proposition 4.2.2. Let M be a (not necessarily commutative) binoid. Mbool is a boolean binoid such
that nil(M ) ⊆ ker πbool, and whenever ϕ : M → B is a binoid homomorphism with B boolean, there
exists a unique binoid homomorphism ¯ϕ : Mbool → B such that the diagram

ϕ

B

<②②②②②②②②

¯ϕ

M

πbool

Mbool

commutes; that is, ¯ϕπbool = ϕ.
Proof. By deﬁnition, Mbool is a boolean binoid such that f ∼bool nf for all n ≥ 1. In particular,
nil(M ) ⊆ ker πbool. The existence of the induced binoid homomorphism follows from Lemma 1.6.3
since ∼bool ≤ ∼ϕ. Indeed, this need only be checked for the generating relations f ∼bool f + f , for
which ϕ(f ) = 2ϕ(f ) = ϕ(f + f ) obviously holds.

The congruence ∼bool can be characterized more explicitly in the commutative situation.
Lemma 4.2.3. For f, g ∈ M , the following statements are equivalent:
(1) f ∼bool g.
(2) There are n, m ∈ N and x, y ∈ M such that nf = g + x and mg = f + y.
(3) D(f ) = D(g).

(4) V(f ) = V(g).

(5) pMhfi =pMhgi.

(6) Filt(f ) = Filt(g).
Proof. By Proposition 4.1.8, only the equivalence of (1) and (2) need to be shown. To prove (1) ⇒ (2)
one easily checks that the relation ∼ on M deﬁned by f ∼ g, f, g ∈ M , if (2) is satisﬁed is a congruence
with ∼bool ≤ ∼. Conversely, assume that nf = g + x and mg = f + y for some n, m ∈ N and x, y ∈ M .
Similar to the proof (of the supplement) of Proposition 4.1.8, we get f ∼bool f + g and g ∼bool f + g,
hence f ∼bool g.
From now on we focus again on commutative binoids. Note that in this case the we the equality
nil(M ) = ker πbool by the characterization of ∼bool in (2) above.
Corollary 4.2.4. Given a boolean binoid B, there is a canonical binoid embedding

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Lemma 4.2.3.

B −→ P(spec B)∩ with f 7−→ D(f ) .

By applying the preceding result to the binoids P(V )∩ and P(V )∪ for a ﬁnite set V , we obtain the
embeddings

P(V )∩ −→ P(spec P(V )∩)∩ ,

J 7−→ D(J) = {PI,∩ | I ⊆ J}

and

P(V )∪ −→ P(spec P(V )∪)∩ ,

J 7−→ D(J) = {PI,∪ | J ⊆ I} ,

cf. Example 2.2.7. Now we give an explicit topological description of the booleanization.
Corollary 4.2.5. Let M be a binoid. The set B(M ) = {D(f ) | f ∈ M} deﬁnes a commutative boolean
binoid, namely

which is isomorphic to Mbool.

(B(M ),∩, spec M,∅) =: B(M )∩ ,

4 Topology of commutative binoids

Proof. Obviously, (B(M ),∩, spec M, ∅) is a commutative boolean binoid. Thus, the canonical binoid
epimorphism β : M → B(M ), f 7→ D(f ), factors through ¯β : Mbool → B(M ), [f ] 7→ D(f ), by
Proposition 4.2.2. Clearly, ¯β is surjective and the injectivity follows from Lemma 4.2.3.

Example 4.2.6. By Example 2.2.21, we have spec(Nn)∞ = {heiii∈I | I ⊆ {1, . . . , n}}. Thus,

D(f ) = {P ∈ spec(Nn)∞ | f 6∈ P} = {heiii∈I | supp f ∩ I = ∅} ,

which yields B((Nn)∞) ∼= Pn.
Observe that the canonical binoid epimorphism β : M → B(M ) with f 7→ D(f ), fulﬁlls (like the
projection πbool)

ker β = {f ∈ M | D(f ) = ∅} = {f ∈ M | f nilpotent} = nil(M ) ,

where the equality in the middle is due to Lemma 4.1.5(5). In what follows, we will not distinguish
between the booleanization (Mbool, πbool) and its topological realization (B(M ), β).
Corollary 4.2.7. The canonical binoid epimorphism β : M → B(M ), f 7→ D(f ), induces a continuous
semigroup isomorphism

β∗ : specB(M ) ∼−→ spec M .

Proof. By Corollay 4.1.19, β∗ is a continuous embedding on im β∗. To prove that im β∗ = spec M let
P ∈ spec M and deﬁne Q := {D(f ) | f ∈ P}. The fact that D(f ) ∩ D(g) = D(f + g) shows that Q
is an ideal in B(M ), which is even prime since D(f ) ∩ D(g) ∈ Q implies that f ∈ P or g ∈ P, hence
D(f ) ∈ Q or D(g) ∈ Q. This shows that Q ∈ specB(M ) with β∗(Q) = P.
Remark 4.2.8. The N -spectra of a binoid and of its booleanization are usually not isomorphic. For
instance, we have N - spec N∞ ∼= N by Lemma 1.5.7 but

N - spec(N∞)bool = N - spec FC(x)/(2x = x) ∼= bool(N )

by Example 1.5.5(1). In particular, if N = K is a ﬁeld of characteristic 6= 2, then K- spec(N∞)bool =
{χ{0}, χM • } ∼= {0,∞} but K- spec N∞ ∼= K.
Corollary 4.2.9. Every binoid homomorphism θ : M → N induces a unique binoid homomorphism
B(θ) : B(M ) → B(N ) such that the diagram

M

θ

N

βM

B(M )

B(θ)

βN

/ B(N )

commutes. In particular, B : comB → boolB is a covariant functor from the category of commutative
binoids into the category of commutative boolean binoids boolB.

Proof. By Proposition 4.2.2, the composition βN θ induces the desired unique binoid homomorphism
between the booleanizations.

Now we relate the bidual of a binoid, which was studied in detail in Section 1.2, to its booleanization.

Corollary 4.2.10. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated binoid. The map B(M ) → M vv with D(f ) 7→ δf ,
where δf (χ) = χ(f ) for χ ∈ M v , is a binoid isomorphism. In particular, M vv ∼= M if and only if M
is boolean.

Proof. The map B(M ) → M vv of the statement is the binoid homomorphism ¯δ induced by the
canonical binoid homomorphism δ : M → M vv , f 7→ δf , where δf : M v → {0,∞}, δf (χ) = χ(f ), cf.
Proposition 4.2.2 (see also Remark 1.5.13). In other words, there is a commutative diagram

with ¯δ(D(f )) = δf . To prove the bijectivity of ¯δ, we use the identiﬁcation M v ∼= spec∅ M via
αP ↔ P, P ∈ spec∅ M , cf. Corollary 4.1.2. For the injectivity let f, g ∈ M and suppose that
δf (αP ) = δg(αP ) (i.e. αP (f ) = αP (g)) for all P ∈ spec∅ M . Thus, f ∈ P if and only if g ∈ P for every
P ∈ spec M , which implies that D(f ) = D(g). For the surjectivity let ψ ∈ M vv , ψ : spec∅ M → {0,∞}.
Note that spec∅ M is a ﬁnite set by Proposition 2.2.20 because M is a ﬁnitely generated binoid.
Since ψ is a binoid homomorphism, ker ψ is a superset-closed subset of spec∅ M .
In particular, if
A := {Q ∈ spec∅ M | Q 6∈ ker ψ}, then ¯Q :=SQ∈A Q is a prime ideal that does not lie in ker ψ. So
there is an element fP ∈ P for every P ∈ ker ψ such that fP 6∈ ¯Q. Hence, ψ = δf = ¯δ(D(f )) with
f :=PP∈ker ψ fP .

Corollary 4.2.11. If M is a ﬁnitely generated binoid, then (M v )vv = M v .

Proof. If M is ﬁnitely generated, then so is M v by Proposition 2.2.20 and Corollary 4.1.2. Now the
statement follows from Corollary 4.2.10

4.3 Dimension

Deﬁnition 4.3.1. The d i m e n s i o n of a nonzero binoid M , denoted by dim M , is deﬁned to be the
c o m b i n a t o r i a l d i m e n s i o n of the space spec M endowed with the Zariski topology, which is given
by the supremum of the lengths of all chains of irreducible closed subsets in spec M . The dimension
of the zero binoid is −1 by convention.
So far, we have seen that the ideal theory of a commutative binoid M resembles that of a ring, and
the same is true for the topological theory of their spectra. Therefore, the following results will appear
familiar again.

Lemma 4.3.2. Let M be a binoid. Then

dim M = sup{ℓ | P0 ⊂ P1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Pℓ,Pi ∈ spec M} .

Proof. By Lemma 4.1.4(3) and Proposition 4.1.16, every chain of prime ideals P0 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Pℓ in M
gives rise to a chain of irreducible closed subsets V(Pℓ) ⊂ ··· ⊂ V(P0) in spec M and vice versa. This
shows the equality.

Example 4.3.3.
(1) By Example 2.2.21(1)-(3), we have for n ≥ 1,

dim(Nn)∞ = n ,

dim(N∞)n = 2n − 1 ,

and

N∞ = 1 .

4 Topology of commutative binoids

Corollary 4.3.4. dim M = dim Mred for every nonzero binoid M .

Proof. This follows from Corollary 2.2.11.

Corollary 4.3.5. Let M be a subbinoid of N . If N is integral over M with respect to the inclusion
ι : M ֒→ N , then dim M = dim N .
In particular, for an arbitrary subbinoid M of N , one has
dim M = dim M

N

.

Proof. This follows from Corollary 2.2.16.

Corollary 4.3.6. If a binoid M admits a generating set with n elements, then dim M ≤ n.
Proof. This follows from Proposition 2.2.20.

Proposition 4.3.7. A binoid M is a binoid group if and only if it is integral and dim M = 0

Proof. The only if part is immediate. On the other hand, if M is integral, then {∞} is a prime ideal,
and since dim M = 0, it is the only prime ideal. Hence, {∞} = M+ = M \ M ×.
Deﬁnition 4.3.8. Let M 6= {∞}. The h e i g h t of a prime ideal P ∈ spec M is the supremum of the
lenghts of strictly increasing ﬁnite chains in spec M that end with P. In other words,

htP := sup{ℓ | P0 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Pℓ = P,Pi ∈ spec M} .

The d i m e n s i o n of P is the supremum of the lenghts of strictly increasing ﬁnite chains in spec M
that start with P. In other words,

dimP := sup{ℓ | P = P0 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Pℓ,Pi ∈ spec M} .

For dim M =: d < ∞, let Fi denote the number of all prime ideals P ∈ spec M of dimension i, i ∈ N.
Then Fk = 0 for all k > d and the (d + 1)-tuple

F (M ) := (F0(M ), F1(M ), . . . , Fd(M ))

is called the F - v e c t o r of M .

Minimal primes have height 0 and ht M+ = dim M , which implies Fd ≤ # min M and F0(M ) = 1.
Lemma 4.3.9. Let P be a prime ideal of the binoid M . Then

htP = dim MP and

dimP = dim M/P .

Proof. This follows from Corollary 2.2.17 and Corollary 2.2.10.

Remark 4.3.10. As pointed out by Anderson and Johnsen in [3], Krull’s principal ideal theorem,
which states that in a noetherian ring R every prime ideal p that is minimal over the ideal (r1, . . . , rk) (
R has ht p ≤ k ([23, Theorem 10.2]), need not be true for binoids that satisfy the ascending chain
condition (a.c.c.) on ideals, or equivalently, in which all ideals are ﬁnitely generated. The binoid

M = FC(x, y)/(x + y = 2x)

is ﬁnitely generated, hence fulﬁlls the a.c.c. on ideals (and on congruences, cf. Remark 1.6.6). The
prime ideals of M are given by

{∞} ( hxi ( hx, yi = M+ ,

4.4 K - points

121

which shows that M+ is minimal over hyi, but ht M+ = 2 > 1. However, in [3, Theorem 4.4] it is
shown that Krull’s principal ideal theorem is true for binoids that satisfy the a.c.c. on ideals and the
following weaker cancellation property

a + b = a + c 6= ∞ ⇒ c = u + b for some u ∈ M × .

For cancellative1 monoids that satisfy the a.c.c. on ideals, Krull’s principal ideal theorem has been
proved by Kobsa, cf. [38, Satz 13.7].

4.4 K - points

Convention. In this section, K always denotes a ﬁeld.

As the title of this section indicates, we are going to pursue a topological approach to binoids via
their K - spectra, which were introduced in Section 1.5 (for arbitrary binoids K).2 For this, we tacitly
assume basic knowledge of the following geometric objects in commutative algebra: the s p e c t r u m
of a ring R,

Spec R := {p ⊆ R | p prime (ring) ideal in R} ,

which is a topological space equipped with the Zariski topology, and the K - s p e c t r u m of a com-
mutative K - algebra A,

K- Spec A = HomK- alg(A, K) ,

which is a topological subspace of Spec A via

with ϕ 7→ ker ϕ. For a detailed treatment of the topological spaces Spec A and K- Spec A, we refer to
[47, Chapter 2 and 3].

K- Spec A −→ Spec A

By Proposition 3.2.3, we have the following isomorphism

K- spec M ∼= K- spec K[M ] ,

where a K - point ϕ : M → K of M corresponds one-to-one to the K - algebra homomorphism ˜ϕ :
K[M ] → K with

for F =Pa∈M raT a ∈ K[M ]. In particular, a characteristic point αP , P ∈ spec M , corresponds to

raϕ(a) ∈ K

˜ϕ(F ) = Xa∈M
˜αP : Xa∈M

raT a 7−→ Xa∈M\P

ra .

The above identiﬁcation allows for regarding K- spec M as a topological space, where the closed sets
are given by the aﬃne algebraic sets

VK(F ) = {ϕ ∈ K- spec M | ˜ϕ(F ) = 0}

1 Cancellative in the sense of monoid theory, which means a + b = a + c implies b = c.
2 Note that arbitrary binoids are written additively, but a ﬁeld K is a binoid with respect to the multiplication.

DK({Fi}i∈I ) := K- spec K[M ] \ VK({Fi}i∈I ) ,

for Fi ∈ K[M ], i ∈ I.
Lemma 4.4.1. Let M be a binoid.

(1) VK(Si∈I Ai) =Ti∈I VK(Ai) for a family Ai ⊆ K[M ], i ∈ I, of subsets.
(2) VK(Pj∈J aj) =Tj∈J VK(aj) for a family aj ⊆ K[M ], j ∈ J, of ideals.

(3) VK(F G) = VK(F ) ∪ VK(G) for F, G ∈ K[M ].
(4) VK((F, G)) = VK(F ) ∩ VK(G), where (F, G) is the ideal in K[M ] generated by F, G ∈ K[M ].
(5) VK(ab) = VK(a ∩ b) = VK(a) ∪ VK(b) for ideals a, b ⊆ K[M ].
(6) VK(A) ⊆ VK(B) for subsets A, B ⊆ K[M ] with B ⊆ A.
(7) VK(1) = ∅ and VK(0) = K- spec K[M ].
Proof. All assertions are easily veriﬁed or follow from the corresponding statements on Spec K[M ].

Proposition 4.4.2. For a binoid homomorphism ϕ : M → N , the induced semigroup homomorphism
ϕ∗ : K- spec N → K- spec M , ψ 7→ ψϕ, is continuous, namely, if a is an ideal in K[M ], then

(ϕ∗)−1(DK(a)) = DK(aK[N ]) and (ϕ∗)−1(VK(a)) = VK(aK[N ]) ,

where aK[N ] is the extended ideal φ(a)K[N ] under the K - algebra homomorphism φ : K[M ] → K[N ]
with raT a 7→ raT ϕ(a), a ∈ M • .
Proof. By taking complements, it suﬃces to prove the statement for the closed sets. Moreover, we
only need to consider ideals of the form a = (F ) for one F ∈ K[M ]. For these ideals, we have

ϕ∗(VK(F )) = {ψ ∈ K- spec N | ˜ψ(ϕ(F )) = 0}, where ˜ψ(G) :=Pa∈M • raψ(a) if G =Pa∈M • raT a,

which implies the statement.

Proposition 4.4.3. Let M be a binoid.
(1) If I is an ideal in M , then

K- spec(M/I) ∼= VK(K[I]) .

(2) For f ∈ M , we have

K- spec Mf ∼= DK(T f ) ∼= {ϕ ∈ K- spec M | ϕ(f ) 6= 0} .

Proof. Both statements follow from the general fact that for a K - algebra homomorphism φ : A → A′
the induced map φ∗ : K- Spec A′ → K- Spec A, ψ 7→ φψ, is continuous so that for an ideal a in A
one has (φ∗)−1(VK(a)) = VK(φ(a)A′), where φ(a)A′ is the extended ideal of a in A′ via φ, cf. [47,
Proposition 2.B.15]. Applying this to the K - algebra homomorphisms

K[M ] −→ K[M/I] ∼= K[M ]/K[I] and K[M ] −→ K[Mf ] ∼= K[M ]{T nf |n∈N} ,

cf. Corollary 3.2.8(3)&(4), proves the proposition.

4.4 K - points

123

Remark 4.4.4. If x1, . . . , xn generate the binoid M , the canonical binoid epimorphism (Nn)∞ → M ,
ei 7→ xi with i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, induces a surjective K - algebra homomorphism

K[X1, . . . , Xn] −→ K[M ]

with Xi 7→ T xi, i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Hence, there is an embedding
K- spec M −→ An(K)

with ϕ 7→ (ϕ(x1), . . . , ϕ(xn)), which shows that the topology on K- spec M can also be given as the
subspace topology of An(K) (this is also true for the natural topology if K = R or C). In particular,

K- spec FCn ∼= An(K) .

Under the above embedding K- spec M ֒→ An(K), the subset VK((Fi)i∈I ) ⊆ K- spec M , Fi ∈ K[M ],
i ∈ I, can be identiﬁed with

{a ∈ An(K) | Fi(a) = 0 for all i ∈ I} ,

and the characteristic points αP : M → {1, 0} ⊆ (K,·, 1, 0) for P ∈ spec M , which are independent of
K, are given by the 0 -1 - points

(αP (x1), . . . , αP (xn)) ∈ An(K) .

For instance, if M is positive, then αM+ corresponds to (0, . . . , 0) ∈ An(K). Moreover, one has P ⊆ P ′
for two prime ideals P and P ′ if and only if αP (xi) ≥ αP ′ (xi) for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Example 4.4.5. The pictures below visualize the R - spectra of three diﬀerent commutative binoids in
A2(R). The marked points are the characteristic points (spec M as a set) sitting inside the R - spectra.

R- spec FC(x, y)/(x + y = 0)

R- spec FC(x, y)/(x + y = 3y)

R- spec FC(x, y)/(2(x + y) = 4(x + y))

Note that the C - spectrum of the binoid FC(x, y)/(x + y = 0) is irreducible in the Zariski and in the
complex topology, whereas the R - spectrum is not even connected in the real topology as shown in
the example above. This is a good example for the following result.

Lemma 4.4.6. Let M be a torsion-free regular ﬁnitely generated binoid and K algebraically closed.
Then K- spec M is irreducible.

Proof. By Theorem 3.2.10, K[M ] is a domain, so (0) ∈ Spec K[M ] is the only minimal prime ideal.
Hence, Spec K[M ] is irreducible (this is true for all ﬁelds) by a result on Spec K[M ] analogous to
Corollary 4.1.17. See for instance [47, Corollary 3.A.14]. Since K is algebraically closed, K- spec M ∼=
K- Spec K[M ] coincides with the set of all maximal ideals of K[M ], denoted by Spm K[M ], cf. [47,
Theorem 2.A.2]. This implies that Spm K[M ] is a dense open subset of Spec K[M ], cf. [47, Theorem
2.B.12 and Exercise 3.A.20]. Therefore, Spm K[M ] = K- spec M is irreducible as well.

4 Topology of commutative binoids

By Remark 2.2.23, the semigroup N - spec M decomposes into subsemigroups that are monoids. This
decomposition transfers to the topological situation (if N is a ﬁeld).

Proposition 4.4.7. Let M be a binoid. Then

K- spec M = [P∈spec M

K- spec(M/P)can ,

where K- spec(M/P)can are closed subsets of K- spec M . In particular, if M is cancellative, then

K- spec M = [P∈min M

VK(K[P]) .

Proof. On the one hand, we have for every P ∈ spec M a closed embedding

K- spec(M/P)can −→ K- spec M

induced by the surjection πP : M → (M/P)can, cf. Proposition 1.5.6. On the other hand, every
K - point ϕ : M → K of M factors through (M/ ker ϕ)can by Proposition 1.7.14(2), which proves

K- spec M = [P∈spec M

K- spec(M/P)can .

The supplement follows from Proposition 4.4.3(1) and the fact that P ⊆ Q for P,Q ∈ spec M implies
that K[P] ⊆ K[Q], and hence VK(K[Q]) ⊆ VK(K[P]) by Lemma 4.4.1(6).
Deﬁnition 4.4.8. Let M be a binoid. We call K- spec(M/P)can, P ∈ spec M , the c a n c e l l a t i v e
K - p a r t s , and those that are maximal with respect to set inclusion are called the c a n c e l l a t i v e
K - c o m p o n e n t s .

Cancellative components need not be irreducible though the name suggests so, cf. Example 4.5.4.

Deﬁnition 4.4.9. Let M be a binoid, P ∈ spec M , and ϕP := ιπ the canonical binoid homomorphism

M π−→ M/P ι−→ diﬀ(M/P) ,

where π is the canonical projection onto the integral binoid M/P and ι the canonical binoid homo-
morphism to the diﬀerence group (M/P)(M/P)• 6= {∞}. With this notation, two elements f, g ∈ M
are called f u n c t i o n a l l y e q u i v a l e n t if ϕP (f ) = ϕP (g) for every P ∈ spec M . The relation ∼fe
on M given by f ∼fe g if f and g are functionally equivalent deﬁnes a congruence on M .
The name stems from the characterization of functionally equivalent elements in Proposition 4.4.11(3)
below.

Example 4.4.10. Nilpotent elements are functionally equivalent to ∞ because nf = ∞ implies that
nϕP (f ) = ϕP (nf ) = ∞ for every P ∈ spec M . Hence, ϕP (f ) = ∞ since diﬀ(M/P) is a binoid group.
In particular, the class [∞] in M/ ∼fe consists of all nilpotent elements by Corollary 2.3.10.
Proposition 4.4.11. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated binoid and f, g ∈ M . The following statements
are equivalent.

(1) f and g are functionally equivalent.
(2) For every commutative binoid group G and every G - point ϕ : M → G, one has ϕ(f ) = ϕ(g).
(3) For every ﬁeld K and every K - point ϕ : M → K, one has ϕ(f ) = ϕ(g).
(4) For every (some) algebraically closed ﬁeld K with char K = 0 and every K - point ϕ : M → K,

one has ϕ(f ) = ϕ(g).

4.4 K - points

125

Proof. The implications (2) ⇒ (3) ⇒ (4) are trivial. For (1) ⇒ (2) assume that f and g are function-
ally equivalent and that ϕ : M → G is a binoid homomorphism to a commutative binoid group G.
By Lemma 1.7.3, ϕ factors through M/ ker ϕ, where ker ϕ =: P is a prime ideal because G is a binoid
group. In particular, we have the following diagram

M

ϕ

π

$❏❏❏❏❏❏❏❏❏❏

ϕP

M/P

G ,

ι

diﬀ(M/P)

where ker ˜ϕ = {∞}. By Corollary 1.13.12, there is a unique binoid homomorphism φ : diﬀ(M/P) → G
with φι = ˜ϕ, hence

ϕ(f ) = ˜ϕ(π(f )) = φ(ιπ(f )) = φ(ϕP (f )) = φ(ϕP (g)) = φ(ιπ(g)) = ˜ϕ(π(g)) = ϕ(g) .

For (4) ⇒ (1) take an algebraic closed ﬁeld K of characteristic 0. Assuming that f and g are not
functionally equivalent, we ﬁnd a prime ideal P ∈ spec M with ϕP (f ) 6= ϕP (g) in

diﬀ(M/P) ∼= Zr × Z/pr1

1 Z × ··· × Z/prs

s Z ,

where pi is a prime number and ri ≥ 1, i ∈ {1, . . . , s}. Thus, for at least one k ∈ {1, . . . , r + s} the kth
entries of ϕP (f ) and ϕP (g) in Zr × Z/pr1
s Z, denoted by (ϕP )k(f ) and (ϕP )k(g), do not
coincide. Since K is algebraically closed of characteristic 0, there are injective group homomorphisms

1 Z×···× Z/prs

i Z −→ K × ,
i ∈ {1, . . . , s}. Hence, ιk ◦ (ϕP )k is a K - point which separates f and g.

ι0 : Z −→ K × and ιi : Z/pri

The condition on the characteristic of the ﬁeld K in (4) of the preceding result is necessary because
in G = (Z/pZ)∞, p prime, any two diﬀerent elements are not functionally equivalent since idG is a
G - point, but the only K - point of G into an (algebraically closed) ﬁeld K of characteristic p is χG• .

Remark 4.4.12. In monoid theory, a monoid homomorphism ϕ : M → K is called a K - c h a r a c t e r
of M . In case K = C or K = S1 = {z ∈ C | |z| = 1} ⊆ C, such a homomorphism is simply called
a c h a r a c t e r , and the set of all characters is a well-studied object of interest, see for instance
[30, Chapter IV.2] or [15, Chapter 5.5]. A fundamental result, cf. [15, Theorem 5.58], says that the
characters of a commutative group G separates its elements; that is, for any two elements a, b ∈ G
there is a character ϕ such that ϕ(a) 6= ϕ(b). Similarly, cf. [15, Theorem 5.59], the characters of a
commutative monoid M separates its elements if and only if M is s e p a r a t i v e ; that is, 2a = a+b = 2b
for a, b ∈ M implies a = b. By [28, Theorem 9.13], a commutative monoid M is separative if and
only if M is free of asymptotic torsion. In this context, the preceding proposition suits the general
monoid theory since asymptotically equivalent elements of a binoid are functionally equivalent (i.e.
∼fe ≤ ∼ae). Indeed, f ∼ae g is equivalent to nf = ng and (n + 1)f = (n + 1)g for some n ≥ 1 by
Lemma 1.4.18. If ϕ : M → K is a K - point, then either ϕ(f ) = ϕ(g) = 0 or ϕ(f ), ϕ(g) ∈ K × with

ϕ(f ) =

ϕ(f )n+1
ϕ(f )n =

ϕ(g)n+1
ϕ(g)n = ϕ(g) .

Hence, f ∼fe g by Proposition 4.4.11.

4 Topology of commutative binoids

We close this section with another characterization of functionally equivalent elements.

Lemma 4.4.13. Two elements f, g ∈ M are functionally equivalent if and only if X f −X g is nilpotent
in K[M ] for every ﬁeld K.

Proof. Let F := X f − X g be nilpotent.
If ϕ : M → K is a K - point, there is by Proposition
3.2.3 a unique K - algebra homomorphism Φ : K[M ] → K such that ϕ = Φι, where ι : M →
K[M ] is the canonical binoid homomorphism a 7→ X a, a ∈ M . Since F is nilpotent and K a
ﬁeld, 0 = Φ(F ) = Φ(X f ) − Φ(X g), which gives ϕ(f ) = Φ(X f ) = Φ(X g) = ϕ(g). Conversely,
if F is not nilpotent in K[M ] for some ﬁeld K, then {F n | n ≥ 0} is a multiplicative system in
K[M ] such that K[M ]F 6= 0. In particular, Spec K[M ]F 6= ∅. Hence, there is a ring homomorphism
Φ : K[M ]F → Q(K[M ]F /p) = L into the quotient ﬁeld of K[M ]F /p, p ∈ Spec K[M ]F , with Φ(F ) 6= 0.
This is equivalent to Φ(X f ) 6= Φ(X g), which implies that

ϕ : M ι−→ K[M ]

ιF−→ K[M ]F

Φ−→ L

is an L - point of M with ϕ(f ) 6= ϕ(g).

Any two diﬀerent elements f, g ∈ (Z/pZ)∞, p prime, are not functionally equivalent as remarked
after Proposition 4.4.11. However, X − 1 = X 1 − X 0 is nilpotent in K[(Z/pZ)∞] ∼= K[X]/(X p − 1)
for every ﬁeld K with characteristic p because (X − 1)p = X p − 1. This shows that X f − X g being
nilpotent needs to be checked for every ﬁeld. In particular, the ring K[(Z/pZ)∞ is not reduced if
char K = p, whereas (Z/pZ)∞ is a reduced binoid.
As another example consider the (reduced) binoid

M := FC(a, b)/(2a = a + b = 2b) .

Since

3a = a + 2a = a + 2b = (a + b) + b = 2b + b = 3b

the generators a and b are asymptotically equivalent, hence functionally equivalent by Remark 4.4.12.
Thus, X a − X b is a nilpotent element in K[M ] for every ﬁeld K by the preceding lemma.

4.5 Connectedness properties of K - spectra

Convention. In this section, K always denotes a ﬁeld.

Recall that a nonempty topological space is said to be c o n n e c t e d if it is not the union of two
disjoint nonempty open (resp. closed) sets, otherwise the space is said to be d i s c o n n e c t e d .
We want to know which assumptions on a binoid M ensure connectedness of K- spec M . Of course,
every idempotent e in M yields an idempotent in K[M ], namely X e. Then, K- spec M is not connected
since it is the disjoint union of the closed sets VK(X e) = {ϕ ∈ K- spec M | ϕ(e) = 0} and VK(X e −
1) = {ϕ ∈ K- spec M | ϕ(e) = 1}, which are not empty since K- spec M/hei and K- spec Me are
not empty (this follows from the fact that both binoids, M/hei and Me, are not empty, and hence
∅ 6= spec ⊆ K- spec). On the other hand, idempotents in K[M ] do not need to come from idempotents
in M as the subsequent example shows.
At the end of this section we will show that in case of hypersurfaces, the non-existence of non-trivial
combinatorial idempotents is equivalent to connectedness in the torsion-free situation, cf. Corollary
4.5.8. First we state a criterion for connectedness and study hypersurfaces in general.

Example 4.5.1. The binoid (Z/2Z)∞ is not torsion-free and contains no idempotent elements,
whereas its K - algebra K[(Z/2Z)∞] = K[X]/(X 2− 1) contains the idempotent 1

In particular, if char K 6= 2, then K- spec(Z/2Z)∞ is not connected.
The following result is our main combinatorial criterion for connectedness.

Theorem 4.5.2. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated torsion-free binoid and K algebraically closed. The
following statements are equivalent:

(1) K- spec M is connected.

(2) For any two cancellative K - components X and Y of M , there is a sequence X(1), . . . , X(n) of
cancellative K - components with X(1) = X and X(n) = Y such that X(i)∩ X(i + 1) contains a
K - point, i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}.

(3) For any two cancellative K - components X and Y of M , there is a sequence X(1), . . . , X(n) of
cancellative K - components with X(1) = X and X(n) = Y such that X(i)∩ X(i + 1) contains a
characteristic point, i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}.

Proof. The equivalence (1) ⇔ (2) follows from the deﬁnition of connectedness and from Proposition
4.4.7 since all cancellative K - components of M are irreducible closed subsets of K- spec M by Lemma
4.4.6. The implication (3) ⇒ (2) is trivial.
To prove (2) ⇒ (3), it is enough to show that any two cancellative K - components, say X =
K- spec(M/P)can and Y = K- spec(M/Q)can for P,Q ∈ spec M , with a nonempty intersection contain
a common characteristic point of M . Assuming X ∩ Y 6= ∅, we have a K - point of M that factors
through (M/P)can and through (M/Q)can via M - binoid homomorphisms

4 Topology of commutative binoids

Example 4.5.3. The binoid M := FC(x, y)/(x + y = y) satisﬁes all assumptions of Theorem 4.5.2.
Its R - spectrum

R- spec FC(x, y)/(x + y = y)

is connected and the two cancellative R - components meet in a characteristic point. To see this
consider spec M , which consists of three prime ideals, namely

These yield the three cancellative parts:

{∞} ( hyi ( hx, yi = hxi .

R- spec Mcan ∼= R- spec N∞ ∼= R ,

which corresponds to the cancellative R - component given by the vertical line since x ∼can 0, cf.
Lemma 1.5.7,

which corresponds to the cancellative R - component given by the horizontal line, and

R- spec(M/hyi)can ∼= R- spec N∞ ∼= R ,

R- spec(M/hx, yi)can = R- spec{0,∞} ∼= {∞} ,

which corresponds to the special point, cf. Example 1.5.5(2).

Example 4.5.4. If K contains the 8th roots of unity ζ0, . . . , ζ7, for instance if K = C, one may
imagine the K - spectrum of the binoid M := FC(x, y)/(8x + y = y) in the following way:

K- spec FC(x, y)/(8x + y = y)

The binoid satisﬁes all assumptions of Theorem 4.5.2 except the torsion-freeness since 8y = (8x + y) +
7y = 8(x + y). However, its K - spectra is connected and all cancellative K - components are connected
by characteristic points. To see this consider spec M , which is given by the three prime ideals

{∞} ( hyi ( hx, yi = hxi .

4.5 Connectedness properties of K - spectra

These yield the three cancellative parts:

K- spec Mcan ∼= K- spec((Z/8Z)∞ ∧ N∞) ∼= {ζ0, . . . , ζ7} × K ,

which corresponds to the cancellative K - component given by the 8 vertical lines since 8x ∼can 0, cf.
Lemma 1.12.3 and Proposition 1.8.12,

K- spec(M/hyi)can ∼= K- spec N∞ ∼= K ,

which corresponds to the cancellative K - component given by the horizontal line, cf. Lemma 1.5.7,
and

K- spec(M/hxi)can ∼= K- spec{0,∞} ∼= {∞} ,

which corresponds to the special point, cf. Example 1.5.5(2).

Now we study the case of hypersurfaces.

Proposition 4.5.5. Let K be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero and consider the binoid

M := FC(x1, . . . , xn)/(f = g)

with f = f1x1 + ··· + fnxn and g = g1x1 + ··· + gnxn, so that

K[M ] = K[X]/(X f − X g) ,

where X ν := X ν1

1 ··· X νn

n for ν = (ν1, . . . , νn) ∈ Nn.

(1) If g = 0, so that

K[M ] = K[X]/(X f − 1) ,

then K- spec M is connected if and only if M is torsion-free. In this case, there are r, s ≥ 0 such
that

(2) If g 6= 0 and f = ˜f + g, so that

K- spec M = Ar(K) × (K ×)s .

K[M ] = K[X]/X g(X

˜f − 1) ,

then K- spec M is disconnected if supp g ⊆ supp ˜f and connected otherwise.

(3) If f = ˜f + h and g = ˜g + h such that supp ˜f , supp ˜g 6= ∅ with supp ˜f ∩ supp ˜g = ∅, i.e.

then K- spec M is connected.

K[M ] = K[X]/X h(X

˜f − X ˜g) ,

Proof. (1) In this situation, we have by the structure theorem for ﬁnitely generated commutative
groups M ∼= (Nr×Zs×Z/k1Z×···×Z/klZ)∞, where r := #{i | fi = 0}. Thus, K[M ] = K[(Nr)∞]⊗K
K[(Zs)∞] ⊗K K[T ∞], which gives

K- spec M = Ar(K) × (K ×)s × K- spec T ∞ ,

where T := Z/k1Z × ··· × Z/klZ is a ﬁnite torsion group. In particular, M is not torsion-free if and
only if T 6= {0}, which is equivalent to K- spec T ∞ is a ﬁnite set with more than one point. Therefore,
K- spec M is connected if and only if M is torsion-free.
(2) First let supp g ⊆ supp ˜f and choose k ≥ 1 such that k ˜fi ≥ gi for all i ∈ supp ˜f . By assumption,
we have g = f = ˜f + g, which implies that g = k ˜f + g, where k ˜f =Pi∈supp ˜f k ˜fixi. Hence, k ˜f is an

130

4 Topology of commutative binoids

idempotent element in M because

2k ˜f = (k ˜f + g) + (k ˜f − g) = g + (k ˜f − g) = k ˜f ,

in particular X k ˜f is idempotent in K[M ], so K- spec M is not connected. Now let supp g 6⊆ supp ˜f ,
say supp g = {1, . . . , r} but 1 6∈ supp ˜f . Then
K- spec M = VK(X g(X

˜f − 1)) = VK(X g) ∪ VK(X

˜f − 1) ,

where VK(X g) =Sr
i=1 VK(X gi
i=1 VK(Xi) is connected because the origin (0, . . . , 0) ∈ An(K)
i ), i ∈ supp g. Moreover, though VK(X ˜f − 1) might not be connected itself, every
lies in each VK(X gi
K - point a = (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ VK(X ˜f − 1) lies on the line La := {(t, a2, . . . , an) | t ∈ A1(K)} ⊆
VK(X f − 1) since X1 does not occur in X ˜f , on which the K - point (0, a2, . . . , an) ∈ VK(X g1
1 ) lies as
well. Therefore, every K - point of VK(X ˜f − 1) is connected with VK(X g).

i ) =Sr

(3) Here,

K- spec M = VK(X h) ∪ VK(X

˜f − X ˜g) = (cid:16) [i∈supp h

VK(X hi

i )(cid:17) ∪ VK(X

˜f − X ˜g) ,

where VK(X ˜f − X ˜g) is connected and contains the origin (0, . . . , 0), cf. Corollary 5.2.12, which also
lies in every VK(X hi

i ), i ∈ supp h.

Note that the assumption on K being algebraically closed of characteristic zero in the preceding
proposition may make things worse, that is to say, in this case the K - spectrum of a binoid is more
likely to be disconnected. For instance, in dimension 0 or in case of one generator, the K - spectrum
VK(X n − 1) of the (non-torsion-free) binoid (Z/nZ)∞ with n ≥ 2 such that n ≡ 1 mod 2 and
char K = 0, consists only of a single point and is therefore connected if K does not contain the nth
roots of unity. Otherwise, K- spec(Z/nZ)∞ is a set with n ≥ 2 points, hence hausdorﬀ, cf. Example
−1) = VK((X−1)pr
5.2.11. On the other hand, if char K = p > 0, then K- spec(Z/prZ)∞ = VK(X pr
)
is a singleton as well.

Example 4.5.6. We have

K- spec FC(x, y, z)/(x + y + 2z = x + y) = VK(XY (Z 2 − 1)) = VK(X) ∪ VK(Y ) ∪ VK(Z 2 − 1) ,

and these planes are connected for K inﬁnite. In this case, the connected sets VK(X) and VK(Y )
intersect in the line L = {(0, 0, a) | a ∈ A1(K)}. Though the closed set VK(Z 2 − 1) decomposes
further into the disjoint connected sets VK(Z − 1) and VK(Z + 1) (i.e. VK(Z 2 − 1) is not connected),
K- spec FC(x, y, z)/(x + y + 2z = x + y) is connected since L intersects with VK(Z − 1) in (0, 0, 1) and
with VK(Z + 1) in (0, 0,−1).

R- spec FC(x, y, z)/(x + y + 2z = x + y)

4.5 Connectedness properties of K - spectra

131

Example 4.5.7. For K inﬁnite, we have

K- spec FC(x, y, z)/(2x + y + z = x + z) = VK(XZ(XY − 1))

= VK(X) ∪ VK(Z) ∪ VK(XY − 1) .

The connected sets VK(X) and VK(Z) intersect in the line L = {(0, t, 0) | t ∈ A1(K)} but VK(X)
and VK(XY − 1) ∼= K × are disjoint. However, every K - point (a, b, c) ∈ VK(XY − 1) lies on the line
Lab := {(a, b, t) | t ∈ A1(K)} which intersects VK(Z) in (a, b, 0).

R- spec FC(x, y, z)/(2x + y + z = x + z)

Corollary 4.5.8. Let M be a torsion-free binoid such that M ∼= FC(x1, . . . , xn)/(f = g). If K is
a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, then K- spec M is connected if and only if M contains no non-trivial
idempotent elements.

Proof. In general (i.e. regardless if M is torsion-free), if e ∈ M is a non-trivial idempotent element,
then X e is idempotent in K[M ], so K- spec M is not connected. On the other hand, K- spec M is
disconnected if and only if e = ˜e + g and supp g ⊆ supp ˜e by Proposition 4.5.5.
In this case, the
element k˜e, where k ≥ 1 satisﬁes k ˜fi ≥ gi for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, is an idempotent element of M , cf.
the proof of 4.5.5(2).

Example 4.5.9. Let K be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. For any two elements f, g ∈ FC(x1, . . . , xn)
with i ∈ supp f and j ∈ supp g, but j 6∈ supp f and i 6∈ supp g for some i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, the binoids

FC(x1, . . . , xn)/(mf = mg) ,

m ≥ 2, are not torsion-free, but their K - spectra are connected if char K = 0 by Proposition 4.5.5(3).

5 Separation and gradings

This chapter is concerned with the question when the special point is contained in every cancellative

component. For this, we ﬁrst study the separating idealTn≥1 nM+ of a commutative binoid. We are

interested in the case when this ideal is {∞}, in which we call M a separated binoid. Under certain
conditions the separating ideal can easily be described, cf. Proposition 5.1.6, which yields the notion
of (un-) separated elements. We show that the existence of an unseparated element gives a necessary
condition to our question, cf. Proposition 5.1.17. The second part of this chapter deals with gradings
on a binoid (by a monoid). We are particularly interested in positive Nk - gradings, whose existence
is equivalent to M being separated under certain assumptions, cf. Theorem 5.2.7, and which yield a
positive result to our initial question, cf. Theorem 5.2.10.

5.1 Separated binoids

Convention. In this section, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative.

The main focus of this section is the ideal Tn≥1 nM+. As in ring theory, it is of interest to know

when this is the zero ideal because this has topological consequences regarding the K - spectra. For
a treatment of this ideal within commutative algebra of binoids, the reader may consult [3], and [38]
for that of monoids.

Deﬁnition 5.1.1. The idealT∞

is called s e p a r a t e d if

n=1 nM+ is called the s e p a r a t i n g ideal of M . A nonzero binoid M

\n≥1

nM+ = {∞} .

The s e p a r a t e d d i m e n s i o n of a binoid is deﬁned to be dim(M/T∞

by dimsep M .

n=1 nM+) and will be denoted

If M is separated, then dim M = dimsep M , but the converse need not be true, cf. Example 5.1.7.

Example 5.1.2. The binoid N∞ is separated because n(N∞)+ = N∞

≥n, and hence

\n≥1

n(N∞)+ = \n≥1

(N∞

≥n)+ = {∞} .

Remark 5.1.3. The deﬁnition of being separated stems from the terminology in ring theory, which
is based on the fact that the a - adic topology deﬁned on a commutative ring R, a ⊆ R an ideal, is
separated (hausdorﬀ) if and only if

\n≥1

an = {0} ,

cf. [4, Chapter 10] or [31, Chapter 0 §7.2]. Recall that the a - adic completion of R is deﬁned to be the
projective limit of the inverse system (R/an, φnm : R/am → R/an)m≥n≥0 and is denoted by

lim←− R/an := ˆR .

134

5 Separation and gradings

Similarly, every binoid M deﬁnes an inverse system (Mn, ϕnm)m≥n≥0 of binoids, where

Mn := M/nM+ and ϕnm : Mm → Mn ,

, m ≥ n ,

are the canonical projections. The projective limit

lim←− Mn = n(an)n≥0 ∈ Yn≥0

Mn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ϕmn(an) = am , m ≥ no ,

cf. Lemma 1.11.6, may be considered as the c o m p l e t i o n of M . The inverse system (Mn, ϕnm)m≥n≥0
can be illustrated as follows

··· −→ M/(k + 1)M+

ϕk,k+1−→ M/kM+ −→ ··· −→ M/2M+

ϕ12−→ M/M+

ϕ01−→ {0,∞} .

Since the binoid homomorphisms ϕnm, m ≥ n, are injective on Mm \ nM+, every ∞ 6= (an)n≥0 ∈
lim←− Mn is of the form
(by abuse of notation we write a for the class [a]n in Mn if a 6∈ nM+). More precisely, an = ∞ for
0 ≤ n ≤ k and an = a ∈ Mn for n ≥ k + 1 and some a ∈ M • , where k ≥ 0 is the index such that
a ∈ kM+ but a 6∈ (k + 1)M+. In particular, if M is separated, there is a one-to-one correspondence
a ↔ ([a]n)n≥0, which yields

(∞, . . . ,∞, a, a, a, . . .)

If, in addition, M is positive, then K[M+] =: m is a maximal ideal in K[M ] by Proposition 3.3.2.
Therefore,

M ∼= lim←− Mn .

lim←− K[Mn] = lim←− K[M ]/mn = \K[M ] .

Lemma 5.1.4. Let M be a nonzero binoid.

In particular, if K[M ] is not complete (i.e. K[M ] 6= \K[M ]), then K[lim←− Mn] 6= lim←− K[Mn].
(1) M/Tn≥1 nM+ is separated.

(2) If M is integral with dim M = dimsep M < ∞, then M is separated.
(3) If M is positive and separated, then so is every subbinoid of M .
(4) If M is separated, then so is M/I for every ideal I ⊆ M .

n=1 nM+ 6= {∞}, then the prime ideal {∞} is contained inT∞

n=1 nM+, and hence dimsep M <
dim M by Corollary 2.2.10, contrary to our assumption. (3) Let N ⊆ M be a subbinoid and ι : N ֒→ M
the canonical binoid embedding. We have ι(N+) ⊆ M+ by the positivity of M , which implies that
(4)

Proof. (1) Set I :=Tn≥1 nM+. By Corollary 2.2.10, (M/I)+ = M+/I which implies the assertion.
(2) IfT∞
ι(Tn≥1 nN+) ⊆ Tn≥1 nM+ = {∞}. Thus, N is separated as well (the positivity is trivial).
Suppose that [f ] 6= [∞] for some [f ] ∈Tn≥1 n(M+/I). For every n ≥ 1, we ﬁnd a1, . . . , an ∈ (M+)\I

such that f = a1 + ··· + an 6= ∞ in M . This means ∞ 6= f ∈ nM+ for every n ≥ 1, a contradiction
to M separated.

Lemma 5.1.5. Let (Mi)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of nonzero binoids.

separated, then all Mi are so.

(1) If all Mi are separated, then Vi∈I Mi is also separated. Conversely, if Vi∈I Mi is positive and
(2) If all Mi are positive, thenS:
Proof. (1) Set M := Vi∈I Mi. First let all Mi be separated and assume that f ∈ nM+ for every
n ≥ 1, where ∞∧ 6= f = ∧i∈I fi ∈ M , fi ∈ M •

i . Since Mi is separated, there is for every i ∈ I an

i∈I Mi is separated if and only if all Mi are so.

5.1 Separated binoids

135

mi ≥ 1 with fi 6∈ l(Mi)+ for all l ≥ mi. Let m :=Pi∈I mi and I = {1, . . . , r}. By the description of

the prime ideals in the smash product, cf. Corollary 2.2.12, we have

mM+ = m(cid:16)[k∈I

M1 ∧ ··· ∧ (Mk)+ ∧ ··· ∧ Mr(cid:17) .

Thus, for every g = ∧i∈I gi ∈ mM+ there is at least one i ∈ I such that gi ∈ lMi for some l ≥ mi,
which means f cannot be contained in mM+, a contradiction. For the converse let M be positive
and separated. Each Mk can be considered as a subbinoid of M via the canonical binoid embedding

1.8.8(2). The second statement is easily veriﬁed.

ι : Mk ֒→ M , a 7→ abek. Hence, all Mk are separated and positive by Lemma 5.1.4(3) and Lemma

Proposition 5.1.6. Let M be a binoid. Then

{f ∈ M | f = f + g for some g ∈ M+} ⊆ \n≥1

nM+ ,

and equality holds if M is ﬁnitely generated. In particular, if M is positive and ﬁnitely generated, then

\n≥1

nM+ = {f ∈ M | f = f + g for some g 6= 0} .

Proof. If f = f +g for some g ∈ M+, then in particular f = f +g ∈ M+, which gives f = f +ng ∈ nM+
for all n ≥ 1. This proves the inclusion. For the equality, we may assume that {x1, . . . , xl} is a
every n ≥ 1 at least one k - tuple r = (r1, . . . , rk) ∈ Nk such that f = r1x1 + ··· + rkxk + ur with
ur ∈ M × and r1 + ··· + rk ≥ n. In particular, the set

K with respect to the product order is ﬁnite, in particular K ′ ( K. By the deﬁnition of a minimal
element and an easy ﬁniteness argument, see [48, Corollary 5.4], there is for every r ∈ K an s ∈ K ′
with s ≤ r. Thus, we ﬁnd a pair (s, r) ∈ K ′ × K with s 6= r and s ≤ r, which yields

f = r1x1 + ··· + rkxk + ur = s1x1 + ··· + skxk + us

for some ur, us ∈ M ×. This shows that f = f + g with g = ur + (-us) +Pk

By Proposition 5.1.6, the separating ideal of M is hx + yi. Since there is no P ∈ spec M with
P ⊆ hx + yi, the prime ideal lattices of M and M/hx + yi are one-to-one by Corollary 2.2.10. In
particular, dim M = dimsep M = 2.

5 Separation and gradings

Consider now the integral binoid N = FC(x, y, z)/(x + y = x + y + z) (i.e. omit the relation 2z = ∞),
whose separating ideal is hx + yi by Proposition 5.1.6, and whose prime spectrum is spec N = {hJi |
J ∈ P({x, y, z})}.
In particular, {∞} is a prime ideal contained in hx + yi. This gives diﬀerent
dimensions, namely dim N = 3 and dimsep N = 2.

Example 5.1.8. Here is an example, where dim M , dimsep M , and the dimension Dim R[M ] of the
ring R[M ] are pairwise diﬀerent. The prime ideal lattice of the binoid M = FC(x, y, z)/(y + x =
y, z + x = z) is given by

hx, y, zi = hxi

{∞}

Hence, dim M = 3. By Proposition 5.1.6, the separating ideal is hy, zi, so dimsep M = 1. Note that
for a ﬁeld K the Krull dimension Dim K[M ] = Dim K[X, Y, Z]/(Y X − Y, ZX − Z) is 2.
Proposition 5.1.6 gives rise to the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 5.1.9. An element f ∈ M is called w e a k l y s e p a r a t e d if f = ∞ or f = f + g for some
g ∈ M implies g ∈ M ×, otherwise f is w e a k l y u n s e p a r a t e d . We say f ∈ M is s e p a r a t e d if
f = ∞ or f = f + g for some g ∈ M implies g = 0, otherwise f is u n s e p a r a t e d .
Of course, separated implies weakly separated and the converse holds true if M is positive. When
dealing with positive binoids, we will not always mention this (and omit “weakly”). Cancellative
elements are always separated and so are the absorbing and the identity element of a binoid, whereas
idempotent elements 6∈ {0,∞} are not even weakly separated. A binoid in which all elements 6= 0 are
nilpotent contains only the trivial separated elements since x = x + y for some y 6= 0 implies that
ny = ∞ for some n ≥ 2, and hence x = x + y = x + 2y = ··· = x + ny = ∞.
Corollary 5.1.10. In a separated binoid M all elements are weakly separated, and the converse holds
true if M is ﬁnitely generated. In particular, a positive and ﬁnitely generated binoid is separated if
and only if all elements are separated.

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.1.6.

Example 5.1.11. Consider the positive binoid (Q∞
Example 1.3.13(5). We have (Q∞
n ≥ 1. This shows that Q∞

≥0 is not separated because

≥0)+ = Q∞

>0 and a/b = n(a/nb) ∈ nQ∞

≥0, +, 0,∞), which is not ﬁnitely generated, cf.
>0 and

>0 for every a/b ∈ Q∞

n(Q∞

>0)+ = Q∞

>0 ,

\n≥1

but all elements are separated since Q∞

≥0 is cancellative.

Lemma 5.1.12. Let M be a nonzero binoid and I ( M an ideal. If f ∈ M is (weakly) separated,
then so is [f ] ∈ M/I.
Proof. This is immediate since [f ] = [f ] + [g] in M/I is equivalent to f = f + g or f ∈ I, and since
I 6= M implies that I ∩ M × = ∅, we have (M/I)× = {[u] | u ∈ M ×}.

5.1 Separated binoids

137

Lemma 5.1.13. Let (Mi)i∈I be a ﬁnite family of nonzero binoids.

(1) An element ∧i∈I fi ∈Vi∈I Mi is (weakly) separated if and only if all fi ∈ Mi are so.
(2) If all Mi are positive, then (f ; k) ∈ S:

i∈I Mi is separated if and only if f ∈ Mk is so.

Proof. (1) If ∧i∈I fi = ∞∧ or (equivalently) fi = ∞ for some i ∈ I, the statement is trivial. So assume
that all fi 6= ∞ are (weakly) separated and

∧i∈I fi = (∧i∈I fi) + (∧i∈I gi) = ∧i∈I (fi + gi)

k ). (2) is trivial.

for some gi ∈ Mi, i ∈ I. By the deﬁnition of the smash product, ∞ 6= fi = fi + gi for all i ∈ I

cf. Lemma 1.8.8(2)). Conversely, if ∞∧ 6= ∧i∈I fi is (weakly) separated and fk = fk + gk for some

which implies that gi = 0 (gi ∈ M ×) by assumption, and hence ∧i∈I gi = 0∧ (∧i∈I gi ∈ (Vi∈I Mi)×,
k ∈ I and gk ∈ Mk, then fk 6= ∞ and ∞∧ 6= ∧i∈I fi = ∧i∈I fi + gkbek. This implies that gkbek = 0∧
(gkbek ∈ (Vi∈I Mi)×) by assumption, hence gk = 0 (gk ∈ M ×

Lemma 5.1.14. Let M be a binoid consisting only of (weakly) separated elements and S ⊆ M a
submonoid with ∞ 6∈ S.
(1) If M is positive, then so is Mcan,S.
(2) If S ⊆ int(M ), then Mcan,S consists only of (weakly) separated elements as well.
Proof. (1) Note that in a positive binoid the notions of weakly separated and separated are equivalent.
To show that Mcan,S is positive suppose that [0] = [f ] + [g] = [f + g] in Mcan,S for f, g ∈ M . This
is equivalent to f + g + s = s in M for some s ∈ S. By assumption, s = ∞ or f + g = 0, and since
∞ 6∈ S the latter holds. Thus, f = g = 0 by the positivity of M , hence [f ] = [g] = [0]. (2) Assume
that [f ] = [f ] + [g] = [f + g] in Mcan,S. Then f + s = g + f + s in M for some s ∈ S, which implies
that g = 0 (g ∈ M ×) or f + s = ∞ by assumption. Since s is an integral element, we obtain g = 0
(g ∈ M ×) or f = ∞. Thus, [g] = 0 ([g] ∈ (Mcan,S)×) or [f ] = [∞].
Deﬁnition 5.1.15. An o r d e r f u n c t i o n on a binoid M is a map ord : M • → N such that

ord(f + g) ≥ ord(f ) + ord(g)

for all f, g ∈ M with f + g 6= ∞. Such a function is called p o s i t i v e if ord(f ) > 0 for all f ∈ M+.
Since there are no idempotent elements 6= 0 in N, every order function satisﬁes ord(0) = 0, which
implies ord(u) = 0 for all u ∈ M ×.
Proposition 5.1.16. If M is separated, then

δ : M • −→ N ,

f 7−→ max{k ∈ N | f ∈ kM+} ,

where 0M+ := M , is a positive order function on M . Conversely, a binoid is separated if it is ﬁnitely
generated and admits a positive order function.

Proof. It is easily checked that δ deﬁnes a positive order function because the convention 0M+ = M
implies that δ(f ) = 0 if and only if f is a unit. For the converse let ord : M • → N be a positive order
function. Since M is ﬁnitely generated, we have

{f ∈ M | f = f + g for some g ∈ M+} = \n≥1

nM+

by Proposition 5.1.6. Therefore, we only need to show that ∞ is the only weakly unseparated element.
For this assume that f = f + g for some f, g ∈ M • . Then ord(f ) ≥ ord(f ) + ord(g) in N which implies
that ord(g) = 0, and hence g ∈ M ×.

138

5 Separation and gradings

Proposition 5.1.17. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated reduced binoid and K a ﬁeld. If M contains an
unseparated element, then there exists an irreducible component of K- spec M that does not contain
the special point.

Proof. By assumption, there are elements f, g ∈ M with ∞ 6= f = f + g and g 6= 0. Since M is
reduced, the element f + g is not nilpotent, which implies that D(f + g) 6= ∅ by Lemma 4.1.5(5). Take
any P ∈ D(f + g) and let Q := αP : M → K be the (characteristic) K - point corresponding to P,
which satisﬁes αP (f + g) = αP (f ) = 1 and αP (g) = 1. Let S := αM+ : M → K denote the special
point. We have T f = T f T g in K[M ], and therefore VK(T f ) ∪ VK(T g − 1) = K- spec M by Lemma
4.4.1(3)&(7). By the above considerations, the K - point Q lies in VK(T g − 1) but is not contained
in VK(T f ). In particular, there is an irreducible component C ⊆ VK(T g − 1) with Q ∈ C. Then
for every K - point ϕ ∈ C, one has ϕ(T g) = 1, and therefore S 6∈ C since g ∈ M+. Thus, C is the
irreducible component in question.

Example 5.1.18. Consider the following R - spectra:

R- spec FC(x, y)/(x + 2y = 2x + y)

R- spec FC(x, y)/(x + y = x)

R- spec FC(x, y)/(x + y = x, 2x = ∞)

The binoid that yields the R - spectrum on the left-hand side is separated, whereas the other binoids
are not. These two only diﬀer in being reduced or not and show that this condition is necessary in
the preceding proposition.

Corollary 5.1.19. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated binoid that is positive and reduced. If M is not
separated, then there exists an irreducible component of K- spec M that does not contain the special
point.

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.1.17 and Corollary 5.1.10.

5.2 Graded binoids

In this section, we consider binoids that admit a grading and study their K - spectra for a ﬁeld K.
Graded binoids also appear in [19].

Deﬁnition 5.2.1. Let M be a binoid and D a monoid. We call M a D - g r a d e d binoid if there is
a map δ : M • → D such that δ(0) = 0 and for all x, y ∈ M • :

δ(x + y) = δ(x) + δ(y) when x + y 6= ∞ .

Then M is g r a d e d by D with respect to δ, and we call (D, δ) a g r a d i n g of M . The image δ(x) is
the d e g r e e of x. M is p o s i t i v e l y graded by D if in addition nonunits are mapped to nonunits;
that is, δ(M •

+) ⊆ D \ D×.

5.2 Graded binoids

139

By deﬁnition, every grading δ : M • → D maps units and idempotent elements of M to units and
idempotent elements of D, respectively; that is, one always has δ(M ×) ⊆ D× and δ((bool M )• ) ⊆
bool(D).

Example 5.2.2.
(1) Given a binoid M and a monoid D, the constant map x 7→ 0 is a D - grading of M , which is
positive if and only if M is a binoid group. In particular, if M is commutative, δ(M ) need not
necessarily be contained in the center {d ∈ D | d + c = c + d for all c ∈ D} of D.

(2) An integral binoid M is (D, δ) - graded if and only if δ : M • → D is a monoid homomorphism.
(3) The blowup binoid associated to a commutative binoid M and an ideal I ⊆ M , cf. Remark 3.4.8,

is an N - graded binoid via

This N - grading of RI is positive if and only if M is a binoid group.

δ : R•

I −→ N ,

(a; n) 7−→ n .

Remark 5.2.3. If δ : M • → D is a D - grading of M , then M decomposes into the pointed union

M = [·

d∈D

Md

of the pointed sets (Md,∞), where Md = {a ∈ M | δ(a) = d} ∪ {∞}, d ∈ D, with Md + Me ⊆ Md+e
for d, e ∈ D. By Proposition 3.4.7,

K[M ] = Md∈D

K[Md]

as K - modules, that is to say, K[M ] is a D - graded K - algebra. In particular, if M is a positive binoid
with a positive N - grading δ, then

K[M ] = Mn∈N

Rn

, where Rn := Mδ(a)=n

KT a

is a positively graded K - algebra.

Convention. In what follows, arbitrary binoids are assumed to be commutative.
Lemma 5.2.4. Let M be a binoid, D a monoid, and δ : M • → D a grading.
(1) Given an ideal I, the quotient M/I is D - graded by [a] 7→ δ(a), a ∈ M \ I. In particular, if M

is positively graded, then so is M/I.

(2) Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : N → M with ker ϕ = {∞} yields a D - grading of N , namely

(δϕ)|N • . If δ is positive and ϕ local, then δϕ|N • is also a positive grading.

(3) Every monoid homomorphism ϕ : D → E yields an E - grading of M , namely ϕδ. If ϕ(D\D×) ⊆

E \ E×, then ϕδ is positive if δ is so.

Proof. All statements are easily veriﬁed.

Lemma 5.2.5. Let n ≥ 1. A positively Nn - graded binoid contains only weakly separated elements.
Proof. If there are any elements f, g ∈ M • with ∞ 6= f = f + g, then δ(f ) = δ(f ) + δ(g), which
implies that δ(g) = 0 ∈ (Nn)× since Nn is cancellative, hence g ∈ M × by the positivity of δ.
Example 5.2.6. The binoid M := FC(x, y)/(2x = x + y = 3y) admits an unseparated element,
namely f = 2x + 2y because f = f + y and y 6∈ M × = {0}. Thus, M cannot be positively Nn - graded
Indeed, the only Nn - grading δ is the trivial one with
for every n ≥ 1 by the preceding lemma.
x, y 7→ 0 because 2δ(x) = δ(x) + δ(y) implies that δ(x) = δ(y) by the cancellativity of Nn, and
therefore 2δ(x) = 3δ(y) = 3δ(x). Hence, 0 = δ(x) = δ(y).

140

5 Separation and gradings

Theorem 5.2.7. Let M be a positive integral ﬁnitely generated binoid. The following conditions are
equivalent.

(1) M is separated.
(2) M is positively Nk - graded for some k ≥ 1.
(3) M is positively N - graded.

Proof. To prove (1) ⇒ (2), we may assume that M is regular. To see this consider the ﬁnitely generated
regular binoid Mcan = M/ ∼can,M • . By Lemma 5.1.14, Mcan is again separated and positive, and
by Lemma 5.2.4(2) every grading of Mcan extends to a grading of M by the canonical projection
π : M → Mcan. Thus, let M be regular. By Proposition 1.14.6(2), there exists an embedding
f 7−→ ϕ(f ) = (δ(f ), ϕ1(f ), . . . , ϕℓ(f )) ,

ϕ : M ֒→ (Nk × Z/n1Z × ··· × Z/nℓZ)∞ ,

where n1, . . . , nℓ ≥ 2 and k ≥ 1. We claim δ : M • → Nk is a positive grading of M . Since δ is a
monoid homomorphism, we only need to show that δ(f ) = 0 ∈ Nk implies f = 0. Assume that ϕ(f ) =
(0, ϕ1(f ), . . . , ϕℓ(f )) for some f ∈ M . Then ϕ(mf ) = (0, 0, . . . , 0) = ϕ(0) with m = n1 ··· nℓ, and
hence mf = 0 by the injectivity of ϕ, which implies f = 0 by the positivity of M . (2) implies (3) since
the positive Nk - grading of M yields a positive N - grading of M via the evaluation homomorphism
Nk → N, (a1, . . . , ak) 7→ a1 + ··· + ak, cf. Lemma 5.2.4(3). (1) follows from (3) by Lemma 5.2.5.
The binoid of Example 5.2.6 fulﬁlls all conditions of the preceding theorem but is not separated and
admits only the trivial Nn - grading, namely the constant map a 7→ 0.
Example 5.2.8. The integrality condition in Theorem 5.2.7 cannot be ommited. To see this consider
ﬁrst the integral binoid M = FC(x, y, z)/(R1,R2,R3), where

R1 : a1 := y + 2z = 2y + z =: b1 ,
R2 : a2 := x + 2z = 2x + z =: b2 ,
R3 : a3 := x + 3y = 2x + y =: b3 .

The binoid M fulﬁlls all conditions of Theorem 5.2.7 but cannot be positively Nk - graded for k ≥ 1. In
general, every grading δ : M → D by a cancellative monoid D is trivial because R1 and R2 imply that
δ(x) = δ(y) = δ(z) and R3 implies that 4δ(x) = 3δ(x), hence 0 = δ(x) = δ(y) = δ(z). In particular,
M is not separated by Theorem 5.2.7. An unseparated element in M is given by

f := 4x + 5y + 6z = 2b1 + 2a2 + b3

= 2a1 + 2b2 + a3 = 5x + 5y + 6z = x + f .

Now the binoid M/(x + y + z = ∞) also fulﬁlls all conditions of Theorem 5.2.7 except the integrality,
and for the same reason as M it cannot be Nk - graded, k ≥ 1, but it is separated. Elements of the
form nx + mz and ny + mz, n, m ≥ 0, are separated because

nx + mz = rx + sz

or ny + mz = ry + sz

if and only if r + s = n + m as one easily veriﬁes. The elements nx + my are separated since

x + ry = 2x + (r − 2)y
= 3x + (r − 4)y

= 4x + (r − 6)y = ··· = (sx + 2y

sx + y

, if r = 2s + 2 , s ≥ 1 ,
, if r = 2s + 1 , s ≥ 1 .

5.2 Graded binoids

141

Though the absorbing element has no degree by deﬁnition, every grading δ : M • → D of an arbitrary
binoid M gives rise to a well-deﬁned binoid homomorphism

θ : M −→ M ∧ D∞ with θ(x) =(x ∧ δ(x)

∞∧
which in turn induces the following semigroup homomorphism

, if x ∈ M •,
, otherwise,

K- spec D∞ × K- spec M −→ K- spec M ,

(ϕ1, ϕ2) 7−→ (x 7→ ϕ1(δ(x)) · ϕ2(x)) ,

In particular, if M is Nn - graded by δ : M • → Nn,
cf. Proposition 1.5.6 and Proposition 1.8.12.
a 7→ (δ1(a), . . . , δn(a)), and K a ﬁeld, there is a continuous An(K) - action on K- spec M =: X,
namely

An(K) × X −→ X ,

(t,Q) 7−→ tQ ,

where t = (t1, . . . , tn) ∈ An(K) is given by ϕ(t) : (Nn)∞ → K with ei 7→ ti, and the K - point Q by
ϕQ : M → K. Hence, tQ is the K - point

ϕtQ : a 7−→ tδ(a)ϕQ(a) = tδ1(a)

1

··· tδn(a)

n

· ϕQ(a)

in X. Note that 1Q = Q always holds.
Deﬁnition 5.2.9. Let K be a ﬁeld and M an Nn - graded binoid. With the above notation, a K - point
Q is called An(K) - c o n n e c t e d with another K - point P if there is a t ∈ An(K) such that tQ = P.
Theorem 5.2.10. Let K a ﬁeld. If M is a positive binoid that is positively Nn - graded, then every
K - point is An(K) - connected with the special point. In particular, if M is also ﬁnitely generated,
then every cancellative K - component of K- spec M contains the special point.

Proof. First, we claim that for an arbitrary K - point Q ∈ K- spec M the K - point 0Q given by

ϕ0Q : a 7−→ 0δ(aϕQ(a) = 0δ1(a) ··· 0δn(a) · ϕQ(a) ,

is the special point; that is, ϕ0Q(a) = 1 if a = 0 and 1 otherwise. The ﬁrst is obvious because
δ(0) = (0, . . . , 0) ∈ Nn and therefore

ϕtQ(0) = 00 · ϕQ(0) = ϕQ(0) = 1 .

To show that ϕ0Q vanishes on M \ {0}, note that δ(a) = (δ1(a), . . . , δn(a)) 6= 0 ∈ Nn for every
a ∈ M \{0} = M+ since M is positively graded. Thus for every i ∈ {1, . . . , r} there is a j ∈ {1, . . . , n}
such that δj(a) 6= 0 and therefore 0δj (a) = 0, which implies that ϕ0Q(a) = 0. For the supplement, we
may assume that K is inﬁnite, otherwise consider the algebraic closure L of K and the diagram

An(K) × K- spec M

ι

An(L) × L- spec M

K- spec M

/ L- spec M .

For an arbitrary K - point Q, the orbit O := {tQ | t ∈ An(K)} of Q under the An(K) - operation on
X := K- spec M is given by the image of the continuous map An(K) → X, t 7→ tQ. Hence, O is an
of the closed cancellative K - components Xi, and the orbit O of Q has to be contained in one of these

irreducible subset of X because An(K) is so. By Proposition 4.4.7, X =Si∈I Xi is the (ﬁnite) union
components since otherwise O =Si∈I (O ∩ Xi) would be a non-trivial decomposition of O.

5 Separation and gradings

Example 5.2.11. The group homomorphism id : Z/8Z → Z/8Z deﬁnes a positive Z/8Z - grading of
the binoid (Z/8Z)∞. The C - spectrum is given by

C- spec(Z/8Z)∞.

Corollary 5.2.12. Let K be an inﬁnite ﬁeld and M = FC(x1, . . . , xn)/(f = g) so that

K[M ] = K[X]/(X f − X g) .

If supp f ∩ supp g = ∅, then every cancellative component contains the special point. In particular,
K- spec M is connected.

Proof. For f or/and g = ∞, the statement is clear. So let f, g 6= ∞. Then M satisﬁes all assumptions
of Theorem 5.2.7 and is separated since supp f ∩ supp g = ∅. Hence, M is positively N - graded, and
therefore every K - point is A1(K) - connected with the special point by Theorem 5.2.10. In particular,
K- spec M is connected.

6 Binoids deﬁned by a simplicial complex and

simplicial binoids

Simplicial complexes and their associated (Stanley-Reisner) algebras play a major role in combinatorial
commutative algebra. Stanley-Reisner algebras are special monomial algebras and like every monomial
algebra they can be realized as binoid algebras, cf. Remark 2.1.22 and Lemma 6.5.7. In this chapter,
we treat these objects within the framework of binoid theory.
We start with simplicial complexes by recalling basic deﬁnitions. With respect to the union and
intersection of faces, every simplicial complex ∆ deﬁnes two binoids, ∆∞
∩, which are usually
very diﬀerent as we show by studying their generating sets. The Zariski topology on their spectra can
be described in detail and related to the simplicial complex ∆. For simplicial complexes ∆ and ˜∆
on V and ˜V , respectively, we study those morphisms ˜V → V that induce canonical homomorphisms
between the binoids deﬁned by ∆ and ˜∆ and between their N - spectra, which we introduce in the
third section. Finally, we deﬁne the binoid M∆ associated to a simplicial complex ∆, whose binoid
algebra is the Stanley-Reisner algebra of ∆, and characterize those binoids that yield Stanley-Reisner
algebras.

∪ and ∆0

Convention. In this chapter, arbitrary vertex sets are assumed to be ﬁnite.

6.1 Simplicial complexes

In this section, we generalize the binoid structures deﬁned on P(V ) to arbitrary simplicial complexes.
For this we start with recalling basic deﬁnitions concerning them.

Deﬁnition 6.1.1. A ( f i n i t e ) s i m p l i c i a l c o m p l e x ∆ on V is a subset-closed subset of P(V )
that contains all singletons {v}, v ∈ V . We refer to P(V ) as the f u l l simplicial complex on V .
The elements of ∆ are called f a c e s and maximal faces under set inclusion are called f a c e t s . The
d i m e n s i o n of a face F ∈ ∆ and that of the simplicial complex ∆ are deﬁned by

dim F := #F − 1

and

dim ∆ := max{dim F | F ∈ ∆} ,

respectively. Elements of P(V )\ ∆ are n o n f a c e s . A simplicial complex is p u r e if all its facets have
the same dimension. Faces of dimension 0 and 1 are called v e r t i c e s and e d g e s , respectively. We
denote by fi(∆) the number of i - dimensional faces in ∆. Then the (d + 1) - tuple

is called the f - v e c t o r of ∆, where d := dim ∆.

f (∆) = (f−1(∆), f0(∆), . . . , fd(∆))

By deﬁnition, every simplicial complex on V is nonempty and contains the face ∅, which has dimension
−1. With respect to set inclusion, {∅,{v} | v ∈ V } is the smallest simplicial complex on V and P(V ) is
the largest, and they coincide if and only if V is the empty set or a singleton. We have dim P(∅) = −1
and dim P({v}) = 0. In general, 0 ≤ dim ∆ ≤ #V − 1 for every simplicial complex ∆ on V with
#V ≥ 2, and dim ∆ = 0 if and only if ∆ = {∅,{v} | v ∈ V }. Furthermore, f0(∆) = #V and
fd(∆) ≤ #{facets of ∆}, where d = dim ∆, and equality holds if and only if ∆ is pure.

6 Binoids deﬁned by a simplicial complex and simplicial binoids

A simplicial complex is uniquely determined by its facets since

∆ = [F facet of ∆

P(F ) .

The full simplicial complex P(V ) on V deﬁnes two binoids given by

P(V )∩ = (P(V ),∩, V,∅) and P(V )∪ = (P(V ),∪,∅, V ) ,

which have been studied in detail before. Their ideal lattices, ﬁltra, and spectra have been described
in Example 2.1.10, Example 1.4.38, and Example 2.2.7, respectively. These results can be generalized
to arbitrary simplicial complexes ∆ on V .

Deﬁnition 6.1.2. For a simplicial complex ∆ on V denote by

the boolean semibinoid with respect to the intersection of faces, and by

∆∩ := (∆,∩,∅)

∆∞
∪ := (∆ ∪ {∞},∪,∅,∞)

the boolean binoid with respect to the union of faces, where F ∪ G := ∞ if this is not a face of ∆.
The deﬁnition of ∆∩ is in line with our notation for the binoid P(V )∩ introduced in Example 1.1.3
because ∆∩ = P(V )∩ if ∆ = P(V ), while ∆∪ is only deﬁned for ∆ = P(V ). However, we have the
following identiﬁcations

∩ ∼= (∆ ∪ {V },∩, V,∅) and ∆∞
∆0

∪ ∼= (∆ ∪ {V },∪,∅, V ) ,

∪ ֒→ P(V )∪ for every simplicial
∪ ∼= P(V )∪. Moreover,
∪ are isomorphic to {∞} if V = ∅, and to {0,∞} if V = {v}. Let #V ≥ 2. Then ∆∩
∪ are not cancellative since they contain non-trivial idempotent elements. The semibinoid ∆∩
∪ are very diﬀerent

which give rise to natural binoid embeddings ∆0
complex ∆ ⊆ P(V ). In particular, if ∆ = P(V )\{V }, then ∆0

binoids. To describe them in terms of generators, we need the following deﬁnition.

∪ unless ∆ 6= P(V ). In general, ∆0

∩ ֒→ P(V )∩ and ∆0

∩ ∼= P(V )∩ and ∆∞

Deﬁnition 6.1.3. Let M be a boolean commutative binoid. We say M is s e m i f r e e u p t o
i d e m p o t e n c e if there exists a generating set {ai | i ∈ I} such that every element f ∈ M • can be
written uniquely as f =Pi∈J ai for a ﬁnite set J ⊆ I. By abuse of notation, cf. Deﬁnition 1.3.12,
(ai)i∈I is called a s e m i b a s i s of M and the set {ai | i ∈ J} the s u p p o r t of f , denoted by supp(f ).
Lemma 6.1.4. The binoid ∆∞
∪ is semifree up to idempotence with semibasis {v}, v ∈ V . Conversely,
if B is a ﬁnitely generated boolean binoid that is semifree up to idempotence, then B ∼= ∆∞
∪ for some
simplicial complex ∆.
Proof. Only the converse is not trivial. Let V ⊆ B be a ﬁnite generating set that is also a semibasis.
∪ → B with

Obviously, ∆ := {F ⊆ V | Pv∈F v 6= ∞ in B} is a simplicial complex on V , and ∆∞
F 7→ Pv∈F v is a surjective binoid homomorphism, which is also injective since the elements of V

form a semibasis. Hence, B ∼= ∆∞
∪ .

(1) Let ∆ = P(V ) \ {V }. A semibasis of ∆0

minimal generating set X. Moreover, if ∆0
of facets of ∆.

∩ always admits a unique
∩ is semifree up to idempotence, then X is given by the set

Proof. Obviously, the minimal generating set is given by the set consisting of all faces F ∈ ∆ for
which there are no faces G, G′ ∈ ∆ \ {F} with F = G ∩ G′. For the supplement denote this set by
X. Since every semibasis is a minimal generating set, X has to be a semibasis if ∆0
∩ is semifree up
to idempotence. However, X cannot be a semibasis if it contains a nonfacet. Indeed, if G ∈ X is a
nonfacet and F ∈ ∆ a facet with G ( F , then G = F ∩ G are two diﬀerent expressions of G in terms
of elements of X since the facets are always contained in X.

∪ , the unique minimal generating set of ∆0

Example 6.1.7. The converse of the supplement of Proposition 6.1.6 need not be true. If ∆ is the
simplicial complex on {1, 2, 3, 4} with facets {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3} and {3, 4}, then the unique
minimal generating set of ∆0
∩ is given by the set of facets but it is not a semibasis since, for instance,
{1, 2} ∩ {1, 3} = {1, 2} ∩ {1, 4} = {1, 3} ∩ {1, 4} = {1}.
Remark 6.1.8. In contrast to ∆∞
∩ need not be a semibasis.
If ∆0
∩ is not semifree up to idempotence, the minimal generating set has to be constructed. For the
construction note that every subset X ⊆ ∆0
∩ has to contain the facets and the
faces F \ {v}, v ∈ F , F a facet, that cannot be generated by the facets (i.e. for which there is no facet
G ∈ ∆ with G ∩ F = F \ {v}).
let {dim F | F ∈ ∆
Now the unique minimal generating set is constructed in the following way:
facet} = {d1, . . . , ds}, where we may assume that dim ∆ = d1 > ··· > ds ≥ 0. We start with the set
Y1 = {F ∈ ∆ facet| dim F = d1}. Since dim(F ∩G) < min{dim F, dim G} for any two facets F, G ∈ ∆,
the faces F \{v}, v ∈ F , F ∈ Y1, can only be generated by elements of Y1, and those that cannot need
to be added to Y1. Denote the resulting set by X1 and let Y2 := {F ∈ ∆ facet| dim F = d2}. The
same argument as above shows that any face F \ {v}, v ∈ F , F ∈ Y2, that is not contained in P(F )
for F ∈ Y1 can only be generated by the facets F ∈ Y2, otherwise they need to be added to X1 ∪ Y2.
Denote the resulting set by X2 and proceed in the same manner till Xs is attained. By construction,
Xs is the unique minimal generating set.

∩ that generates ∆0

Since the unique minimal generating set of ∆0
∩ always contains the facets, it obviously may have
strictly more than #V elements, but this may also happen if there are less than #V facets, which
means that ∆0
∪ may be very
diﬀerent.

∪ cannot be isomorphic. Evidently, the binoids ∆0

Example 6.1.9. Let ∆ 6= P(V ) be a simplicial complex on V deﬁned by pairwise disjoint facets
F1, . . . , Fr, r ≥ 2, and let n := #F1 + ··· + #Fr = #V . In this case, the unique minimal generating
set of ∆0
∩ has n + r elements, namely Fk and Fk \{v} for v ∈ Fk, k ∈ {1, . . . , r}, and is not a semibasis
because Fk \ {v} = Fk ∩ Fk \ {v}. In particular, ∆0

Proof. This is easily veriﬁed.

Recall that a p a r t i t i o n of a set V is a family (Vi)i∈I of subsets such that V =Si∈I Vi and Vi∩Vj = ∅
for i 6= j. Every simplicial complex ∆ on V admits a partition (Vi)i∈I of V such that ∆ =Ui∈I ∆i,

where ∆i is a simplicial complex on Vi, i ∈ I. Of course this partition need not be unique or might
be trivial; that is when #I = 1. However, there exists always a (unique) ﬁnest partition.

Deﬁnition 6.1.11. A simplicial complex ∆ on V that admits no non-trivial partition of V is said to
be c o n n e c t e d .

Proposition 6.1.12. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V .
(1) ∆ is connected if and only if for any two vertices v, w ∈ V there are facets F1, . . . , Fs ∈ ∆ with

v ∈ F1 and w ∈ Fs such that Fi ∩ Fi+1 6= ∅ for all i ∈ {1, . . . , s − 1}.

(2) There exists a unique partition (Vi)i∈I of V such that ∆ = Ui∈I ∆i, where ∆i is a connected

simplicial complex on Vi, i ∈ I.

Proof. Let A ⊆ ∆ be the subset of facets of ∆ and consider the equivalence relation on V given by

v ∼ w :⇔ ∃F1, . . . , Fs ∈ A such that v ∈ F1, w ∈ Fs and Fi ∩ Fi+1 6= ∅,∀i ∈ {1, . . . , s − 1} .

Denote by V1, . . . , Vl, l ≥ 1, the equivalence classes. Now (1) translates to: ∆ is connected if and only
if l = 1. Clearly, if ∆ is not connected, then l ≥ 2. Conversely, if l ≥ 2 then (Vi)i∈I , I = {1, . . . , l}, is a

on Vi, i ∈ I. This also proves (2) since the ∆i are connected by (1).
Example 6.1.13. The full simplicial complex P(V ) and the simplicial complex of Example 6.1.5 (3)

non-trivial partition of V such that ∆ =Ui∈I ∆i, where ∆i is the simplicial complex {F ∈ ∆ | F ⊆ Vi}
are connected, whereas ∆ = {∅,{v} | v ∈ V } is not connected for #V ≥ 2 since ∆ =Uv∈V P({v}).

Theorem 6.1.14. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . The binoid ∆0
if and only if ∆ decomposes into connected simplicial complexes of the form

∩ is semifree up to idempotence

∆(1) := P(W ) \ {W} or ∆(2) := P({v}) or ∆(3) := {∅,{i},{i, i + 1 mod n} | i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}} .
In this case (and only in this case), ∆∞

∩ are isomorphic.

∪ and ∆0

6.2 Simplicial morphisms

Proof. Of course, ∆0
∩ is semifree up to idempotence if it decomposes in such simplicial complexes
because they are semifree up to idempotence by Example 6.1.5 and then the union of their semibases
yields a semibasis of ∆0
simplicial complexes on Vi, i ∈ I, the isomorphism

∩. Moreover, if V =Ui Vi and ∆ =Ui∈I ∆i, where ∆i is one of these three

is given componentwise ∆∞
i,∩ as in Example 6.1.5. For the converse, it suﬃces to show that
∩ is connected and semifree up to idempotence, then ∆ is of the form ∆(r) for r = 1, 2, or 3. If
if ∆0
#V ≤ 2, there is nothing to show. So let #V ≥ 3. Note that every zero-dimensional simplicial complex
is of the form ∆(2). Furthermore, every one-dimensional connected simplicial complex that is semifree
up to idempotence is of the form ∆(3). Indeed, in such a simplicial complex every facet need to have
dimension 1 by the connectedness, and every vertex has to be contained in precisely two facets because
the simplicial complex is semifree up to idempotence. Thus, we may assume that dim ∆ =: d ≥ 2. We
need to show that ∆ = P(V ) \ {V }. Denote by A the set of facets of ∆. By Proposition 6.1.6, A is a
semibasis of ∆0
∩. In particular, given a facet F of dimension d, say F = {vi | i ∈ I}, I = {1, . . . , d + 1},
there are facets F1, . . . , Fd+1 ∈ A with (after a suitable renumbering) F ∩Fi = F \{vi} and dim Fi = d,
i ∈ I. Hence, Fi = F \ {vi} ∪ {wi} for some wi ∈ V \ F , i ∈ I. For for i 6= j this gives

Fi ∩ Fj = (F \ {vi, vj}

(F \ {vi, vj} ⊎ {w}

, if wi 6= wj ,
, if wi = wj =: w .

In the ﬁrst case, one has F ∩ Fi ∩ Fj = Fi ∩ Fj, which is a contradiction to A being a semibasis. Hence,
wi = w for all i ∈ I and therefore P(W ) \ {W} ⊆ ∆ with W := {v1, . . . , vd+1, w} ⊆ V . To show that
W = V suppose that v ∈ V \ W . Since ∆ is connected we ﬁnd by Proposition 6.1.12 for any w ∈ W
facets G1, . . . , Gs ∈ A with w ∈ G1, v ∈ Gs, and Gj ∩ Gj+1 6= ∅, j ∈ {1, . . . , s − 1}. We may assume
that G1 ⊆ W ; otherwise extend the sequence G1, . . . , Gs by a facet G0 ⊆ W with w ∈ G0. Then there
is an r ∈ {1, . . . , s − 1} such that Gr ⊆ W but Gr+1 6⊆ W . This is again a contradiction to A being a
semibasis because ∅ 6= Gr ∩ Gr+1 ⊆ W is also the intersection of certain Fi from above. Thus, V = W
and therefore ∆ = P(V ) \ {V }.

6.2 Simplicial morphisms

In this section, we consider morphisms ˜V → V between vertex sets of simplicial complexes ˜∆ and ∆
and investigate when such morphisms induce homomorphisms between the binoids deﬁned by these
simplicial complexes. This yields the deﬁnition of simplicial, α-simplicial, and β-simplicial morphisms
for which we will give various examples that will appear later on.
Lemma 6.2.1. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V and ˜V , respectively, and λ : ˜V → V a
map. The following statements are equivalent.
(1) Every image of a nonface is a nonface; that is, F 6∈ ˜∆ implies λ(F ) 6∈ ∆.
(2) Every preimage of a face is a face; that is, F ∈ ∆ implies λ−1(F ) ∈ ˜∆.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) Let F ∈ ∆. Since λ(λ−1(F )) ⊆ F the image λ(λ−1(F )) is also a face of ∆.
Hence, λ−1(F ) ∈ ˜∆ since otherwise λ(λ−1(F )) 6∈ ∆ by assumption on λ. (2) ⇒ (1) Let F 6∈ ˜∆.
Since F ⊆ λ−1(λ(F )) the preimage λ−1(λ(F )) is not a face of ˜∆. Hence, λ(F ) 6∈ ∆ since otherwise
λ−1(λ(F )) ∈ ˜∆ by assumption on λ.

6 Binoids deﬁned by a simplicial complex and simplicial binoids

Deﬁnition 6.2.2. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V and ˜V , respectively, and λ : ˜V → V a
map.
(1) λ is a s i m p l i c i a l morphism if every image of a face is a face; that is, F ∈ ˜∆ implies λ(F ) ∈ ∆.
(2) λ is an α - s i m p l i c i a l morphism if λ satisﬁes one of the equivalent conditions of Lemma 6.2.1.
(3) λ is a β - s i m p l i c i a l morphism if every preimage of a nonface is a nonface; that is, F 6∈ ∆

implies λ−1(F ) 6∈ ˜∆.

Since these properties depend on the chosen simplicial complexes, we will write

λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) −→ (V, ∆) .

The category of simplicial complexes together with simplicial, α-simplicial and β-simplicial morphisms
will be denoted by SC, SCα, and SCβ, respectively.

Our deﬁnition of a simplicial morphism is consistent with the terminology in topology of abstract
simplicial complexes, cf. [25, Chapter II.2].

Example 6.2.3. Here are examples of morphisms that satisfy only one property, simplicial or α-
simplicial or β-simplicial, but none of the other both. For this let V = {1, . . . , n}, n ≥ 3.
(1) Let T = V \ {n} and F = {n − 1, n}. The map

λ : (T, P(T )) −→ (V, P(V ) \ {V, F}) with v 7−→ v

is simplicial because P(T ) ⊆ P(V ) \ {V, F}. Since λ−1(F ) = {n − 1} ∈ P(T ) \ {T} but F 6∈
P(V ) \ {V, F} it is not α-simplicial, and it is not β-simplicial because λ−1(V ) = T ∈ P(T ) but
V 6∈ P(V ) \ {V, F}.

(2) Let ∆ = {∅,{v} | v ∈ V \ {n}}. The map

λ : (V, P(V ) \ {V }) −→ (V \ {n}, ∆) with v 7−→(v

, if v 6= n ,
n − 1 , otherwise,

is α-simplicial because V is the only nonface of P(V ) \ {V } and λ(V ) = V 6∈ ∆. On the other
hand, it is not simplicial because λ({1, 2}) = {1, 2} 6∈ ∆ but {1, 2} ∈ P(V ) \ {V }, and since
λ−1({1, 2}) = {1, 2} ∈ P(V ) \ {V } but {1, 2} 6∈ ∆ it is not β-simplicial.

(3) Let n = 3, ∆ = P(V ) \ {V,{1, 3}}, and ˜∆ = {∅,{1},{2}}. The map

λ : (V, ∆) −→ ({1, 2}, ˜∆) with v 7−→(1, if v ∈ {1, 3} ,

2, otherwise,

is β-simplicial because the only nonface in ˜∆ is {1, 2} and λ−1({1, 2}) = V 6∈ ∆. On the other
hand, it is not simplicial because λ({1, 2}) = {1, 2} 6∈ ˜∆ but {1, 2} ∈ ∆, and it is not α-simplicial
because λ−1({1}) = {1, 3} 6∈ ∆ but {1} ∈ ˜∆.

Example 6.2.4. Here are examples of morphisms that satisfy all except one property. Let V =
{1, . . . , n} with n ≥ 2.
(1) Let ∆ and ˜∆ be a simplicial complexes on V such that ˜∆ ( ∆. Then

id : (V, ˜∆) −→ (V, ∆)

is simplicial since ˜∆ ⊆ ∆. It is β-simplicial since nonfaces of ∆ are nonfaces of ˜∆, but it is not
α-simplicial because there is by assumption a face F ∈ ∆ with F 6∈ ˜∆, hence λ−1(F ) = F 6∈ ˜∆.

6.2 Simplicial morphisms

149

(2) Let T ( V . The morphism

λ : (T, P(T )) −→ (V, P(V ) \ {V }) with v 7−→ v

(3) Let T = V \ {n}. The morphism

is simplicial since P(T ) ⊆ P(V ), and it is α-simplicial since P(T ) has no nonfaces. However, λ
is not β-simplicial because λ−1(V ) = T ∈ P(T ) but V 6∈ P(V ) \ {V }.
λ : (V, P(V ) \ {V }) −→ (T, P(T ) \ {T}) with v 7−→(v

, if v 6= n ,
, otherwise,

n − 1

is α-simplicial since V is the only nonface of P(V )\{V } and λ(V ) = T 6∈ P(T )\{T}, and since T
is the only nonface of P(T )\{T} and λ−1(T ) = V 6∈ P(V )\{V } it is also β-simplicial. However,
λ is not simplicial because λ(T ) = T 6∈ P(T ) \ {T} but T ∈ P(V ) \ {V }.

Lemma 6.2.5. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V and ˜V , respectively.
(1) If λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) → (V, ∆) is surjective and simplicial, then it is β-simplicial.
(2) If λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) → (V, ∆) is injective and β-simplicial, then it is simplicial.
Proof. (1) If λ is surjective, we have F = λ(λ−1(F )) for all F ⊆ V . Thus, if λ is simplicial and
λ−1(F ) ∈ ˜∆, then λ(λ−1(F )) ∈ ∆ and therefore F ∈ ∆. (2) If λ is injective we have F = λ−1(λ(F ))
for all F ⊆ ˜V . Thus, if λ is β-simplicial and λ(F ) 6∈ ∆, then F = λ−1(λ(F )) 6∈ ˜∆.
Example 6.2.6. Let V = {1, . . . , n − 1}, n ≥ 2. Consider ∆ = P(F0) ∪ P(F1), where F0 = {1, . . . , k}
and F1 = {s, . . . , n − 1} for some s ∈ {2, . . . , k + 1}, and ˜∆ = P(F0) ∪ P(F1 ∪ {n}). The surjection

λ : (V ∪ {n}, ˜∆) −→ (V, ∆}) with v 7−→(v

, if v 6= n ,
, otherwise,

n − 1

is simplicial and β-simplicial but not injective. On the other hand, for ∆0 = {∅,{v} | v ∈ V } and
˜∆0 = {∅,{v},{v, n} | v ∈ V ∪ {n}} the injective map

λ : (V, ∆0) −→ (V ∪ {n}, ˜∆0) with v 7−→ v

is simplicial and β-simplicial but not surjective. Note that both morphisms are α-simplicial.

Proof. (1) To verify that ϕλ is well-deﬁned, we need to check that ϕλ(F ∪ G) = ∞ (or equivalently
λ−1(F ∪ G) 6∈ ˜∆), whenever F ∪ G 6∈ ∆ for F, G ∈ ∆ and λ−1(v) 6= ∅ for all v ∈ F ∪ G. Indeed, the
latter assumption yields λ(λ−1(F ∪ G)) = F ∪ G. Hence, λ−1(F ∪ G) 6∈ ˜∆ since otherwise, we had
F ∪ G ∈ ∆ because λ is simplicial. Moreover, ϕλ is a binoid homomorphism because λ−1(F ∪ G) =
λ−1(F ) ∪ λ−1(G) for all F, G ∈ ∆, and ϕλ(∞) = ∞ and ϕλ(∅) = ∅ by deﬁnition. If λ is injective,
then G = λ−1(λ(G)) for all G ⊆ ˜V . In particular, if G ∈ ˜∆, then λ(G) ∈ ∆ since λ is simplicial, and
hence ϕλ(λ(G)) = λ−1(λ(G)) = G, which shows that ϕλ is surjective if λ is injective.

λ is also surjective. For the supplement note that

Remark 6.2.8.

(1) For a simplicial morphism λ that is surjective but not injective ϕλ need not be surjective as
Example 6.2.6 shows. Here F1 has no preimage under ϕλ : ∆∞
∪ because every G ∈ ∆
with F1 = ϕλ(G) = λ−1(G) fulﬁlls n − 1 ∈ G, but then n ∈ λ−1(G), which is not contained in
F1. Hence, F1 ( λ−1(G).
λ is usually no binoid homomorphism, whether λ : ˜V → V is

(2) Example 6.2.4(2) shows that ϕβ

∪ → ˜∆∞

simplicial or α-simplicial.
(3) If λ is β-simplicial, then ϕβ

λ need not be surjective if λ is surjective but not injective. An example
is given by the β-simplicial morphism λ : (V, ∆) → ({1, 2}, ˜∆) of Example 6.2.3(3). Here the
facet {1, 2} ∈ ∆ has no preimage under ϕβ

Lemma 6.2.9. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V and ˜V , respectively, and λ : ˜V → V a

Proof. For (1) note that λ(F ∩ G) = λ(F ) ∩ λ(G) for all F, G ⊆ ˜V if and only if λ is injective.
Therefore, the injectivity is necessary. The rest of the lemma follows from the deﬁnitions of simplicial
and α-simplicial morphisms.

Remark 6.2.10. For λ being only injective, the map ψ : ˜∆0

∩ → ∆0

F 7−→(0

λ(F )

one has λ(v) ∈ ∆, and hence

ψ(F ∩ {v}) = ψ(∅) = ∅ but ψ(F ) ∩ ψ({v}) = ψ({v}) = λ(v) .

Similarly, the map ψ : ∆0

F 7−→(0

, if F = 0 or λ−1(F ) 6∈ ˜∆ ,

λ−1(F )

V }, and λ = idV . For pairwise diﬀerent elements u, v, w ∈ V one has

ψ({u, w} ∩ {v, w}) = ψ({w}) = {w} but ψ({u, w}) ∩ ψ({v, w}) = 0 ∩ 0 = 0 .

We close this section by applying Lemma 6.2.7 and Lemma 6.2.9 to three important examples that
will appear later on.
Example 6.2.11. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V such that ˜∆ ⊆ ∆. The morphism

Example 6.2.12. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . If T ⊆ V and ∆(T ) = {F ∈ ∆ | F ⊆ T},
then

If T ( V , then ι is not β-simplicial unless ∆ 6= P(V ). To see this take a facet F ∈ ∆(T ). Since
∆ 6= P(V ) there are v1, . . . , vr ∈ V \ T such that G := F ∪ {v1, . . . , vr} 6∈ ∆ but ι−1(G) = F ∈ ∆(T ).
If ∆ = P(V ), the map ι is also β-simplicial, hence

6.3 N - points of a simplicial complex

This section deals with N - points of a simplicial complex ∆, which will later be related to the N - points
of the (simplicial) binoid deﬁned by ∆

Convention. In this section, N always denotes a commutative nonzero binoid.

Deﬁnition 6.3.1. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . An N - p o i n t of ∆ is a map

ρ : V −→ N such that Xv∈A

ρ(v) = ∞ if A 6∈ ∆ .

The N - s p e c t r u m of ∆ is the set of all N - points of ∆, denoted by N - spec ∆. With respect to
the addition N - spec ∆ is a semibinoid with absorbing element ε : v 7→ ∞, v ∈ V .

is a v ∈ A such that ρ(v) = ∞, and if N is a multiplicatively written, this condition on ρ : V → N

If N is integral the propertyPv∈A ρ(v) = ∞ for all A 6∈ ∆ is equivalent to: for every A 6∈ ∆ there
translates toQv∈A ρ(v) = 0 for every nonface A of ∆. In particular, if K is a ﬁeld, the map ρ : V → K

is a K - point if and only if for every A 6∈ ∆ there is a v ∈ A such that ρ(v) = 0. Later we will prove
that K- spec ∆ ∼= K- Spec K[∆], where K[∆] is the Stanley-Reisner algebra of ∆, cf. Proposition
6.5.16.

Lemma 6.3.2. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . A subset F ⊆ V is a face of ∆ if and only if
χF : V → {0,∞} is an N - point (with respect to {0,∞} ֒→ N ).

F ∈ ∆ and A 6∈ ∆, then A 6⊆ F . Thus, we ﬁnd a w ∈ A \ (A ∩ F ), but this means χF (w) = ∞ and

Proof. Obviously, F is a face if χF is an N - point because Pv∈F χF (v) = 0 6= ∞. Conversely, if
thereforePv∈A χF (v) = ∞.

6 Binoids deﬁned by a simplicial complex and simplicial binoids

Proposition 6.3.3. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V and ˜V , respectively. The following
conditions on a map λ : ˜V → V are equivalent.
(1) λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) → (V, ∆) is an α-simplicial morphism.
(2) For every ρ ∈ N - spec ∆, N a commutative binoid, ρλ : ˜V → N is an N - point of ˜∆.
(3) For every ρ ∈ K- spec ∆, K a ﬁeld, ρλ : ˜V → K is a K - point of ˜∆.
In particular, every α-simplicial morphism λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) → (V, ∆) induces a semibinoid homomorphism

λ∗ : N - spec ∆ −→ N - spec ˜∆

with ρ 7→ ρλ, which is injective if λ is surjective.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) For an arbitrary nonface A ⊆ ˜V of ˜∆, we have
nwρ(w)

Xv∈A

ρλ(v) = Xw∈λ(A)

for certain nw ≥ 1, w ∈ λ(A). By assumption, λ(A) 6∈ ∆ and ρ is an N - point, hencePw∈λ(A) ρ(w) =
∞, but this is a summand ofPv∈A ρλ(v). (2) ⇒ (3) is obvious. (3) ⇒ (1) Suppose that A ⊆ ˜V is a
nonface of ˜∆ but λ(A) ∈ ∆. By Lemma 6.3.2, the map χλ(A) : V → {1, 0} ⊆ K is a K - point of ∆,
which yields the K - point χλ(A)λ of ˜∆ with Qv∈A χλ(A)(λ(v)) = 1, a contradiction to A 6∈ ˜∆. The
supplement is clear.
Example 6.3.4. The α-simplicial morphism id : (V, ∆) → (V, ˜∆) from Example 6.2.11, where ∆ and
˜∆ are simplicial complexes on V such that ˜∆ ⊆ ∆, induces a semibinoid embedding

N - spec ˜∆ −→ N - spec ∆ with ρ 7−→ ρ .

The α-simplicial morphisms ι : (T, ∆(T )) → (V, ∆) from Example 6.2.12, where T ⊆ V and ∆(T ) =
{F ∈ ∆ | F ⊆ T}, induces the semibinoid homomorphism

N - spec ∆ −→ N - spec ∆(T ) with ρ 7−→ ρ|T .

Finally, the α-simplicial morphisms ιk : (Vk, ∆k) →(cid:0)V,Ui∈I ∆i(cid:1) and ˜ιk : (Vk, ∆k) → (cid:0)V,Qi∈I ∆i(cid:1),
k ∈ I, from Example 6.2.13, where ∆i is a simplicial complex on Vi, i ∈ I, and V =Ui∈I Vi, induce

the semibinoid homomorphisms

and

N - spec]i∈I
N - specYi∈I

∆i −→ N - spec ∆k with ρ 7−→ ρ|(Vk;k)

∆i −→ N - spec ∆k with ρ 7−→ ρ|(Vk;k) .

Proposition 6.3.5. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V and ˜V , respectively. The following
conditions on a map λ : ˜V → V are equivalent.
(1) λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) → (V, ∆) is a β-simplicial morphism.
(2) For every ρ ∈ N - spec ˜∆, N a commutative binoid, the map
v 7−→ Xw∈λ−1(v)

p(w)

bρ : V −→ N with

is an N - point of ∆.

6.3 N - points of a simplicial complex

155

(3) For every ρ ∈ K- spec ˜∆, K a ﬁeld, the map
bρ : V −→ K with

is a K - point of ∆.

v 7−→ Yw∈λ−1(v)

p(w)

In particular, every β-simplicial morphism λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) → (V, ∆) induces a semibinoid homomorphism

λ∗ : N - spec ˜∆ −→ N - spec ∆

with ρ 7→bρ, which is injective if λ is so.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) For an arbitrary nonface A ⊆ V of ∆, we have

Xv∈Abρ(v) = Xv∈A Xw∈λ−1(v)

ρ(w) = Xw∈λ−1(A)

ρ(w) = ∞

because ρ is an N - point of ˜∆ and λ−1(A) 6∈ ˜∆ by assumption on λ. Hence, bρ is an N - point of ∆.

(2) ⇒ (3) is obvious. To show (3) ⇒ (1) suppose that A ⊆ V is a nonface of ∆ but λ−1(A) ∈ ˜∆. By
Lemma 6.3.2, the map χλ−1(A) : ˜V → {1, 0} ⊆ K is a K - point of ˜∆, so by assumption

is a K - point of ∆ with

χλ−1(A)(w) ,

bχλ(A) : V −→ K with v 7−→ Yw∈λ−1(v)
χλ−1(A)(w) = Yw∈λ−1(A)

Yv∈Abχλ(A)(v) = Yv∈A Yw∈λ−1(v)

χλ−1(A)(w) = 1 ,

which is a contradiction to A 6∈ ∆. For the supplement assume that ρ1, ρ2 ∈ N - spec ˜∆ such that
bρ1 = bρ2. Then bρ1(v) = bρ2(v) for all v ∈ V , but by the injectivity of λ we have

ρi(w) = ρi(λ−1(v))

bρi(v) = Xw∈λ−1(v)

for all v ∈ V , i ∈ {1, 2}. Thus, ρ1 = ρ2.

Example 6.3.6. The β-simplicial morphism eid : (V, ˜∆) −→ (V, ∆) from Example 6.2.11, where ∆
and ˜∆ are simplicial complexes on V such that ˜∆ ⊆ ∆, induces a semibinoid embedding

N - spec ˜∆ −→ N - spec ∆ with ρ 7−→ ρ ,

which is the semibinoid embedding of Example 6.3.4. In particular, we always have an embedding

N - spec ˜∆ −→ N - spec P(V ) = N #V .

Remark 6.3.7. By Lemma 6.2.5(1), a surjective simplicial morphism λ : ( ˜V , ˜∆) → (V, ∆) is also
β-simplicial. Hence, Proposition 6.3.5 applies to λ in this case and gives a semibinoid embedding

λ∗ : N - spec ˜∆ −→ N - spec ∆ with ρ 7−→bρ .

Proposition 6.4.1. Let ∆ 6= P(V ) be a simplicial complex on V .
(1) ∆ is an ideal in P(V )∩.
(2) A subset A ⊆ P(V ) is a prime ideal in P(V )∩ if and only if A 6= P(V ) deﬁnes a pure simplicial
(3) P(V ) \ ∆ = ∆c is an ideal in P(V )∪ with P(V )∪/∆c ∼= ∆∞

complex on V of dimension #V − 2; that is, A =Sv∈G P(V \ {v}) for some ∅ 6= G ⊆ V .

∪ via π∆ . In particular, spec ∆∞

∪ ∼=

V(∆c) = {P ∈ spec P(V )∪ | ∆c ⊆ P}.

Proof. (1) and (2) follow immediately from Example 2.2.7, and (3) from Example 2.1.10 and Corollary
4.1.19.

Proposition 6.4.2. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . The one-to-one correspondences

SF,∩ := {G ∈ ∆0

F (∆0

∩) ←→ ∆ ∪ {V } ←→ F (∆∞
∪ )
←→ {G ∈ ∆∞

∩. In particular,

and

spec ∆∞

are semibinoid isomorphisms, the latter inclusion preserving and the ﬁrst reversing. In particular,
spec∅ ∆0

∪ and spec∅ ∆∞

∩ as binoids.

∩ ∼= ∆∞

∪ ∼= ∆0

Proof. By deﬁnition, every ﬁlter S of ∆0
∩ has to contain the identity element V and since A, B ∈ S is
equivalent to A∩ B ∈ S, there is a unique minimal element F ∈ S with respect to ⊆ and all supersets
of F in ∆ ∪ {V } lie in S. This proves the correspondence SF,∩ ↔ F . Similarly, every ﬁlter S of ∆∞
admits a maximal element F ∈ S with respect to ⊆ and all subsets of F in ∆ ∪ {V } lie in S, which
proves the correspondence F ↔ SF,∪. By taking complements, we obtain the results for the spectra
of ∆0

∪ . Moreover, for two faces F, F ′ ∈ ∆ one has

∩ and ∆∞

SF,∩ ∩ SF ′,∩ = SF ∪F ′,∩ and SF,∪ ∩ SF ′,∪ = SF ∩F ′,∪ ,

and (with respect to the union on ∆∞

PF,∩ ∪ PF ′,∩ = PF ∪F ′,∩ and PF,∪ ∪ PF ′,∪ = PF ∩F ′,∪ .

In particular, S∅,∩ = ∆∪ V = SV,∪, SV,∩ = {V }, and S∅,∪ = {∅}, which gives PV,∩ = ∆ = (∆0

P∅,∪ = ∆∞
∪ )+. This implies the binoid and semibinoid isomorphisms. Clearly, if F ⊆ F ′,
then PF ′,∪ ⊆ PF,∪. On the other hand, if PF ′,∪ ⊆ PF,∪, then F ⊆ F ′ since F ′ ∈ PF ′,∪. Similarly,
F ⊆ F ′ is equivalent to PF,∩ ⊆ PF ′,∩.
Note that for ∆ = P(V ) \ {V } the preceding lemma includes all results for P(V )∩ and P(V )∪, cf.
Example 1.4.38 and Example 2.2.7. The semibinoid homeomorphisms induced by ι∆ and π∆ are given
by the epimorphism

ι∗
∆ : spec P(V )∩ −→ spec ∆0

∩ with {J ⊆ V | F 6⊆ J} 7−→ PF,∩

for ∅ 6= F ⊆ V , and by the embedding

π∗
∆ : spec ∆∞

∪ −→ spec P(V )∪ with PF,∪ 7−→ P(V ) \ P(F )

for F ∈ ∆.
Corollary 6.4.3. dim ∆ + 1 = dim ∆0

∩ = dim ∆∞

∪ for every simplicial complex ∆ 6= P(V ) on V.

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 6.4.2.

The preceding results show that spec ∆0
∪ always have the same cardinality and the
∩ and ∆∞
same dimension as topological spaces endowed with the Zariski topology. However, if ∆0
∪
are not isomorphic as binoids, the Zariski topologies on their spectra are dual to each other as the
following corollary shows.

bijection

g : ∆ −→ spec ∆0

with F 7→ PF,∩, is a homeomorphism if the poset (∆,⊆) is endowed with the lower topology
Proof. Since spec ∆∞

∩ are ﬁnite sets, the Zariski topology coincides with the lower topol-
∪ are given

∪ and spec ∆0

DP = {Q ∈ spec ∆∞

∪ | Q ⊆ P}

for P ∈ spec ∆∞

∪ . The basic open sets in the upper topology of the poset (∆,⊆) are given by ∅ and

DF = {G ∈ ∆ | F ⊆ G}

for F ∈ ∆. This shows that h−1(DPF,∪ ) = DF because G ⊆ F is equivalent to PF,∪ ⊆ PG,∪ by
Proposition 6.4.2. Similarly, g is a homeomorphism if (∆,⊆) is endowed with the lower topology,
where the basic open subsets are given by

DF = {G ∈ ∆ | G ⊆ F}

for F ∈ ∆. By Proposition 6.4.2, G ⊆ F is equivalent to PG,∩ ⊆ PF,∩, and therefore g−1(DPF,∩ ) = DF ,
where DP = {Q ∈ spec ∆0

∩ | Q ⊆ P} for P ∈ spec ∆0

∩ are the basic open sets of spec ∆0

6 Binoids deﬁned by a simplicial complex and simplicial binoids

6.5 Simplicial binoids

Now we deﬁne the binoid associated to a simplicial complex ∆ such that its binoid algebra is the
Stanley-Reisner algebra of ∆. Conversely, we characterize those binoids that yield Stanley-Reisner
algebras, cf. Theorem 6.5.8. Then the tools and notations developed in the last sections will be applied
to these binoids.

Deﬁnition 6.5.1. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . The binoid associated to ∆ is deﬁned to be

M∆ := FC(V )/I∆ ,

where I∆ denotes the ideal {f ∈ FC(V ) | supp(f ) 6⊆ ∆} in the free commutative binoid FC(V ). A
binoid M is called a s i m p l i c i a l b i n o i d if M ∼= M∆ for a simplicial complex ∆. In this case,
the simplicial complex ∆ is unique and called the u n d e r l y i n g s i m p l i c i a l c o m p l e x of M .
Simplicial binoids together with binoid homomorphisms form a full subcategory of the category comB
of commutative binoids, which will be denoted by simplB.

Equivalently, one may deﬁne the binoid M∆ by

M∆ := {ϕ : V → N map | supp ϕ ∈ ∆} ∪ {∞} ,

where supp ϕ = {v ∈ V | ϕ(v) 6= 0}, with addition deﬁned by

ϕ + ψ :=(ϕ + ψ , if supp(ϕ + ψ) ∈ ∆ ,

Example 6.5.2. MP(V ) coincides with the free binoid FC(V ) ∼= (Nn)∞.

where nv = 0 if v 6∈ F and mv = 0 if v 6∈ G. In particular, for every f ∈ M •
F ∈ ∆ such that f =Pv∈F nvv with nv ≥ 1 for all v ∈ F .

simplicial complex ∆ are pairwise disjoint, then M∆ = S:

F facet of ∆ FC(F ). See also Corollary 6.5.20

∆ there is a unique face

Now we recall the deﬁnition of the Stanley-Reisner algebra of a simplicial complex, cf. [12, Chapter
5.1] or [56, Chapter 5.3].

Deﬁnition 6.5.4. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V = {v1, . . . , vn} and R[X1, . . . , Xn] the
polynomial algebra over the ring R. The S t a n l e y - R e i s n e r
i d e a l I∆ of ∆ is the ideal
in R[X1, . . . , Xn] generated by all monomials Xj1 ··· Xjs such that {vj1, . . . , vjs} 6∈ ∆. Then the
S t a n l e y - R e i s n e r a l g e b r a (also called f a c e r i n g ) of ∆ over R is given by the graded R - algebra
R[X1, . . . , Xn]/I∆ =: R[∆].

Example 6.5.5. If ∆ = P(V ), then I∆ = (0), hence R[∆] is the polynomial algebra R[Xv | v ∈ V ].

6.5 Simplicial binoids

Remark 6.5.6. By deﬁnition, I∆ is generated by squarefree monomials. On the other hand, for every
ideal I in R[X1, . . . , Xn] that is generated by squarefree monomials, there is a simplicial complex on
V , #V = n, such that R[X1, . . . , Xn]/I ∼= R[∆]. Moreover, if ∆ and ∆′ are simplicial complexes on
the same vertex set V , then ∆ ⊆ ∆′ if and only if I∆′ ⊆ I∆.
As announced, every Stanley-Reisner algebra can be realized as a binoid algebra.

Lemma 6.5.7. If ∆ is a simplicial complex and R a ring, then R[∆] ∼= R[M∆ ].
Proof. If ∆ be a simplicial complex on V = {1, . . . , n}, then R[M∆ ] = R[FC(V )]/R[I∆] with

where X a = X a1
we get

1 ··· X an

R[I∆] = (T a | a ∈ I∆) = (X a | a ∈ FC(V ), supp a 6⊆ ∆) =: I ,
n for a =Pi∈V aii. Since X a ∈ I if and only if X ˜a ∈ I for ˜a =Pi∈supp(a) i,

i, J 6⊆ ∆(cid:17) = (Xj1 ··· Xjs | {j1, . . . , js} 6⊆ ∆) = I∆ .

I =(cid:16)X a (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) a = Xi∈J⊆V

Thus, R[M∆ ] is the Stanley-Reisner algebra of ∆.

Simplicial binoids can be characterized as follows.

Theorem 6.5.8. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . The binoid M∆ is ﬁnitely generated by #V = n
elements, semifree, and reduced. Conversely, every commutative binoid M satisfying these properties

is a simplicial binoid. More precisely, M is isomorphic to M∆ , where ∆ := {F ⊆ W |Pw∈F w 6= ∞}

for a minimal generating set W of M .

Proof. By Corollary 2.1.21 and Lemma 1.4.2, we only need to show that M∆ is reduced. This follows
immediately from the fact that supp(f + f ) = supp(f ) ∪ supp(f ) = supp(f ). For the converse note
that such a generating set exists by Proposition 1.4.27. So take a semibasis W of M and consider the
canonical binoid epimorphism ϕ : FC(W ) −→ M with w 7→ w. By Lemma 1.4.23, M is cancellative.

to ϕ(f ) = ϕ(g) = ∞ or nw = mw for all w ∈ W , and hence f = g. Furthermore, we have by Lemma
1.4.2 that f + f + g = ∞ implies that f + g = ∞ for all f, g ∈ M . Applying this successively to

Therefore, if f, g ∈ FC(W ) with f =Pw∈W nww and g =Pw∈W mww, then ϕ(f ) = ϕ(g) is equivalent
Pw∈T nww = ∞, where T ⊆ W , nw ≥ 1, w ∈ T , yieldsPw∈T w = ∞ because if u ∈ T with nu ≥ 2,

then

∞ = Xw∈T

nww(cid:17)
nww = u + u +(cid:16)(nu − 2)u + XT \{u}
nww(cid:17)
= u +(cid:16)(nu − 2)u + XT \{u}
= u + XT \{u}

nww .

= . . .

Thus, we have shown that ∼ϕ = ∼I, where I = {Pw∈T w ∈ FC(W ) | Pw∈T w = ∞ in M}, which
gives FC(W )/I ∼= M by Proposition 1.6.2. Since
I =nXw∈F

where ∆ := {F ⊆ W | Pw∈F w 6= ∞} is a simplicial complex on W , we obtain I = I∆. Thus,
M ∼= FC(W )/I∆ .

w ∈ FC(W )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)F 6⊆ ∆o ,

6 Binoids deﬁned by a simplicial complex and simplicial binoids

Example 6.5.9. The binoid FC(x, y)/(2x + y = ∞) is not a simplicial binoid since it is not (strongly)
reduced, cf. Lemma 1.4.2(2).

Corollary 6.5.10. Let I be a radical ideal in M . If M is a simplicial binoid, then so is M/I.
Proof. By the characterization of simplicial binoids given in Theorem 6.5.8 above, the statement
follows from Lemma 2.1.19 and Lemma 2.3.8, and the simple fact that f + f + g = ∞ implies
f + g = ∞ also holds in M/I.
Example 6.5.11. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V and P ∈ spec M∆ . By Corollary 6.5.13 below,

P = P ˜F = hv ∈ V | v 6∈ ˜Fi for some face ˜F ∈ ∆. If A = {F ∈ ∆ | F facet} so that ∆ =SF ∈A P(F ),
then M∆ /PF = M ˜∆ , where ˜∆ =SF ∈A P(F ∩ ˜F ).

Lemma 6.5.12. The booleanization of M∆ is isomorphic to ∆∞
∪ .
Proof. By Proposition 4.2.2, the binoid homomorphism ϕ : M∆ → ∆∞
F ∈ ∆ and nv ≥ 1, induces a binoid homomorphism ¯ϕ : (M∆ )bool → ∆∞
F ∈ ∆, which is obviously bijective.
Corollary 6.5.13. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V . Every face F ∈ ∆ deﬁnes a ﬁlter in M∆ ,
namely Filt(F ) = {f ∈ M∆ | supp(f ) ⊆ F}, and hence a prime ideal M∆ \ Filt(F ) such that the

are semibinoid isomorphism. In particular, the binoids ∆0
Proof. Since Filt(G∩ G′) = Filt(G)∩ Filt(G′) and Filt(∅) = M ×
∆ , the canonical maps on the left-hand
side are semibinoid homomorphism, which are inverse to each other. The rest follows from the ﬁrst
part and the following identiﬁcations

spec M∆ ∼= specB(M∆ ) ∼= spec ∆∞

∪ ∼= ∆∩ ,

which are due to Corollary 4.2.7, Lemma 6.5.12, and Proposition 6.4.2.

Corollary 6.5.14. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V and PF ∈ spec M∆ , F ∈ ∆. Then
(1) dim PF = dim F + 1. In particular, dim M∆ = dim ∆ + 1.
(2) Fi(M∆ ) = fi−1(∆) for all i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , d}, d := dim M∆ ; that is, F (M∆) = f (∆).
(3) The minimal prime ideals of M∆ are of the form PF = {f ∈ M∆ | supp(f ) ⊆ V \ F} for some

facet F ∈ ∆; that is, the irreducible components of spec M∆ correspond to the facets of ∆.

Proof. By Corollary 6.5.13, every prime ideal in spec M∆ is of the form PF := hv | v ∈ V \ Fi for
some F ∈ ∆. In particular, if dim F = r − 1, say F = {v1, . . . , vr}, then

PF = Pr ( Pr−1 ( ··· ( P1 ( P0 ,

where Pi = hv ∈ V | v 6∈ {v1, . . . , vi}i, i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, and P0 = hv | v ∈ V i = (M∆ )+. Hence, every
strictly increasing chain of faces is equivalent to a strictly decreasing chain of prime ideals and vice
versa. This implies all statements, where the supplement of (3) is due to Corollary 4.1.17.

6.5 Simplicial binoids

Remark 6.5.15. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V = {1, . . . , n} and K a ﬁeld. Now we can easily
visualize the K - spectrum of a simplicial binoid M∆ for an arbitrary simplicial complex ∆ on V . By
Proposition 4.4.7, we have

K- spec M∆ ∼= [F ∈∆ facet

VK(K[PF ]) ,

where PF = hv ∈ V | v 6∈ Fi by Corollary 6.5.14(3), and

VK(K[PF ]) ∼= {(a1, . . . , an) ∈ An(K) | ai = 0 if i 6∈ F and ai ∈ K otherwise}

by Remark 4.4.4. Hence,

K- spec M∆ ∼= [F ∈∆ facet

(cid:0) ⊆ An(K) ∼= K- spec MP(V )(cid:1) ,

where A(F ) = A1 × ··· × An with

Ai :=(A1(K)

{0}

, if i ∈ F ,
, otherwise,

In particular, every union of coordinate planes is realizable as the K - spectrum of a simplicial binoid,
and therefore (see below) as the K - spectrum of its underlying simplicial complex. For instance, if
n = 3, then

R- spec MP(V )\V

In topology, the geometric realization of a simplicial complex ∆ on V = {1, . . . , n} is given by

{ϕ ∈ R- spec ∆ | ϕ b= (a1, . . . , an) ∈ An(R), ai ≥ 0, a1 + ··· + an = 1} ,

cf. [25, Chapter II.2.1].

Proposition 6.5.16. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on V and N a commutative binoid. Every
N - point ρ : V → N of ∆ factors uniquely through M∆ ; that is, there is a unique binoid homomorphism
˜ρ : M∆ → N such that ˜ρι = ρ, where ι : V → M∆ denotes the canonical map v 7→ v. In particular,

6 Binoids deﬁned by a simplicial complex and simplicial binoids

∆ can be written uniquely as f =Pv∈F nvv with nv ≥ 1, v ∈ F ,
Proof. Since every element f ∈ M •
for some F ∈ ∆, the map ˜ρ : M∆ → N with ˜ρ(f ) := Pv∈F nvρ(v) and ˜ρ(∞) := ∞ is well-deﬁned
and satisﬁes ˜ρι = ρ by deﬁnition. To show that ˜ρ is a binoid homomorphism let f =Pv∈F nvv and
g =Pv∈g mvv with F, G ∈ ∆ such that nv, mv ≥ 1. Then

˜ρ(f ) + ˜ρ(g) = Xv∈F

nvρ(v) +Xv∈F

mvρ(v) = Xv∈F ∪G

(nv + mv)ρ(v)

in N , where nv := 0 if v 6∈ F and mv := 0 if v 6∈ G. In particular, nv + mv − 1 ≥ 0 for all v ∈ F ∪ G.
Thus, if F ∪ G is not a face in ∆, then f + g = ∞ in M∆ and

˜ρ(f ) + ˜ρ(g) = Xv∈F ∪G

ρ(v) + Xv∈F ∪G

(nv + mv − 1)ρ(v)

(nv + mv − 1)ρ(v)

= ∞ + Xv∈F ∪G

= ∞

since ρ is an N - point. Hence, ˜ρ(f ) + ˜ρ(g) = ∞ = ˜ρ(∞) = ˜ρ(f + g). If, on the other hand, F ∪ G ∈ ∆,

then f +g =Pv∈F ∪G(nn +mv)v ∈ M∆ , and therefore ˜ρ(f +g) =Pv∈F ∪G(nn +mv)ρ(v) = ˜ρ(f )+ ˜ρ(g)

as above. For the supplement consider the canonical map

ψ : N - spec M∆ −→ N - spec ∆ with ϕ 7−→ ϕι =: ϕ|V ,

where ι : V → M∆ , v 7→ v, as in the proposition. The bijectivity of ψ follows from the ﬁrst part.
Obviously, ψ is a semigroup homomorphism which satisﬁes χ{0} 7→ ε, where χ{0} is the absorbing
element of N - spec M∆ (because M∆ is positive) and ε : v 7→ ∞, v ∈ V , that of N - spec ∆. The
statement on the R - points of the Stanley-Reisner algebra R[∆] and ∆ follows from Proposition 3.2.3
and Lemma 6.5.7.

Proposition 6.5.17. Every binoid homomorphism ϕ : ˜∆∞
∪ gives rise to a homomorphism
φ : M ˜∆ → M∆ of the simplicial binoids deﬁned by ∆ and ˜∆. This binoid homomorphism commutes
via (M∆ )bool ∼= ∆∞

∪ with ϕ. Hence, ϕ = B(φ) and there is a commutative diagram

w(cid:17) = φ(f ) + φ(g) .
On the other hand, f + g = ∞ means F ∪ G 6∈ ˜∆ (or equivalently F ∪ G = ∞ in ˜∆∞
∪ ), which implies
that ϕ(F ∪ G) = ∞ since ϕ is a binoid homomorphism. Hence, φ(f + g) = ∞. By Corollary 4.2.9
and Lemma 6.5.12, every binoid homomorphism φ : M ˜∆ → M∆ induces such a commutative diagram
with B(φ)({v}) = πboolφ(v). Thus, ϕ = B(φ) by the ﬁrst part. The supplement is clear.

such that nv ≥ 1 for all v ∈ Fi, i ∈ I, this binoid homomorphism is an isomorphism. Similarly, the

induce by Corollary 6.5.18(2) binoid homomorphisms M∆k → MUi∈I ∆i , k ∈ I, which give rise to

the binoid homomorphismS:
h ∈ MUi∈I ∆i can be written as h =Pv∈F nvv for a unique face F ∈ ∆i, i ∈ I, such that nv ≥ 1 for

all v ∈ F , this binoid homomorphism is also an isomorphism. The isomorphisms of the supplement
follow from Proposition 1.8.12 and Corollary 1.9.10.

Remark 6.5.21. In combinatorial commutative algebra, the product of two simplicial complexes ∆1
and ∆2 is called the j o i n and is usually denoted by ∆1∗ ∆2, cf. [56, Deﬁnition 5.2.4]. It is known that
the Stanley-Reisner algebra K[∆1 ∗ ∆2] of the join is given by the tensor product K[∆1] ⊗K K[∆2],
with which one proves, for instance, that ∆1 ∗ ∆2 is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if ∆1 and ∆2
are Cohen-Macaulay, cf. [56, Proposition 5.3.16]. The result for the tensor product can be deduced
elegantly from the theory developed in this chapter. By Lemma 6.5.7 and Corollary 6.5.20, we have

K[∆] = K[M∆ ] and MQi∈I ∆i =Vi∈I M∆ . Hence,

K[∆1 × ∆2] = K[M∆1×∆2 ] = K[M∆1 ∧ M∆2 ] = K[M∆1 ] ⊗K K[M∆2 ] = K[∆1] ⊗K K[∆2] ,

where the third equality is due to Corollary 3.5.2.
Example 6.5.22. Let ∆ and ˜∆ be simplicial complexes on V such that ˜∆ ⊆ ∆. The morphisms

(V, ∆) id−→ ( ˜V , ˜∆) id−→ (V, ∆) ,

where the ﬁrst morphism is α-simplicial and the latter simplicial and β-simplicial, cf. Example 6.2.11,
induce the same binoid epimorphism

M∆ −→ M ˜∆ with Xv∈F

nvv 7−→Xv∈F

nvv .

In particular, for every simplicial complex ∆ on V there is a binoid epimorphism MP(V ) → M∆ , which
yields the canonical K - algebra epimomorphism
