Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum information appli-
cations due to their bright single photon emission and optically accessible spin states. Furthermore,
SiV centers in low-strain diamond are insensitive to pertubations of the dielectric environment, i.e.
they show very weak spectral diﬀusion. This property renders ensembles of SiV centers interest-
ing for sensing applications. We here report on photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy
on an SiV ensemble in a low strain, CVD-grown high quality diamond layer, where we measure
the ﬁne structure with high resolution and obtain the linewidths and splittings of the SiV centers.
We investigate the temperature dependence of the width and position of the ﬁne structure peaks.
Our measurements reveal linewidths of about 10 GHz as compared to a lifetime limited width on
the order of 0.1 GHz. This diﬀerence arises from the inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions
caused by residual strain. To overcome inhomogeneous broadening we use spectral hole burning
spectroscopy which enables us to measure a nearly lifetime limited homogeneous linewidth of 279
MHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence of coherent interaction in the system by driving a
Λ-scheme. Additional measurements on single emitters created by ion implantation conﬁrm the
homogeneous linewidths seen in the spectral hole burning experiments and relate the ground state
splitting to the decoherence rate.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, color centers in diamond have attracted
large attention for use in quantum communication and
quantum information processing. Besides the well-known
nitrogen vacancy (NV) center1–3, the negatively charged
silicon vacancy (SiV) center has emerged as a particu-
larly interesting alternative. At room temperature, it
provides narrow zero-phonon-lines (ZPLs) in the near
infrared (738 nm) with line widths below 1 nm, weak
phonon coupling (Huang-Rhys factor of 0.24) and count
rates up to a few million counts per second.4 The SiV
center is created by an interstitial silicon atom and a va-
cancy forming a split-vacancy structure along the (cid:104)111(cid:105)
axes of the diamond lattice (see Fig. 1(a)), resulting
in a doubly split ground and exited electronic state (see
Fig. 1(c)).5–7 This leads to a four line ﬁne structure of
the ZPL at cryogenic temperatures.8–12 Optical access to
the ﬁne structure of single SiV centers has been used to
demonstrate spin-dependent ﬂuorescence13 and coherent
ground state spin manipulation.14,15

In this work, we aim at investigating optical access to
the ﬁne structure of large ensembles of SiV centers which
is important for applications e.g.
in high-sensitivity en-
semble magnetometry16,17, collective nonlinear optical
eﬀects18 and optical quantum memories.19 To this end,
we use photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy
to examine a CVD-grown SiV ensemble. This allows us
to measure the ﬁne structure with high resolution and
to analyse the temperature-dependent linewidth and line
shift of the SiV centers. To overcome inhomogeneous
broadening of the lines in the ensemble, we employ spec-

tral hole burning spectroscopy which enables us to mea-
sure the homogeneous linewidth and compare it to the
lifetime-limit. In order to compare ensemble results to
data gained from single centers, we implant silicon ions
into a high purity diamond which allows us to directly
observe linewidths of single SiV centers in the absence of
inhomogeneous broadening. One requirement for quan-
tum information processing is the possibility to drive co-
herent processes in the system. By driving a Λ-scheme
between two ground states and an excited state, we ex-
plore coherent optical interactions for the SiV center.

II. SAMPLE PREPARATION AND

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The investigated SiV ensemble is contained in a single-
crystal diamond layer which was grown on top of a
(001) Ib high-pressure-high-temperature (HPHT) dia-
mond substrate (Sumitomo) in a hot ﬁlament chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) process (see Fig. 1(b)). The
homoepitaxial growth prevents the formation of strain
due to lattice or thermal expansion mismatch, thereby
minimizing lineshifts and inhomogeneous broadening of
the SiV center ZPL.20 To facilitate high crystalline qual-
ity, the growth parameters were optimized, using a low
methane fraction (0.26% CH4 in H2) and a slow growth
of approximately 10 nm h−1, resulting in a layer thick-
ness of 80-100 nm. Silicon contamination of the CVD
chamber provides the silicon atoms which are incorpo-
rated into the diamond during the growth to form the
SiV centers. For the second sample single SiV centers

are produced by implantation of 28Si ions into a (111)-
oriented type IIa HPHT diamond. After implantation,
the sample is annealed for 3h at 1000◦C in vacuum and
for 1h at 465◦C in air and cleaned in peroxomonosulfuric
acid to remove graphite residues. To enhance ﬂuores-
cence collection, solid immersion lenses (SILs) are fabri-
cated on the surface of the diamond by focused ion beam
milling (for further details, see Ref. 14).
The samples are mounted in a liquid helium ﬂow cryostat
(Janis Research, ST-500LN) integrated into a homebuilt
confocal laser microscope. The temperature can be var-
ied and stabilized between 5 K and room temperature by
adjusting the helium ﬂow and by electrical heating of the
cold ﬁnger. A 100 x microscope objective with a numeri-
cal aperture of 0.8 (Olympus) focuses the laser light onto
the sample and collects the ﬂuorescence. The objective
is placed inside the vacuum of the cryostat, eliminating
the need for focusing through a cover glass and thereby
considerably enhancing the collection eﬃciency. Excita-
tion and ﬂuorescence light are separated by a glass beam
splitter and dielectric longpass and bandpass ﬁlters. Af-
ter coupling into a multimode ﬁber, the ﬂuorescence can
either be measured with an avalanche photodiode (APD,
Perkin Elmer SPCM-AQRH-14) to obtain the photon
count rate or spectrally analysed with a grating spec-
trometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, iHR 550 and Symphony
CCD). A grating with 1800 grooves per mm provides a
resolution of 0.06 nm (30 GHz) at 738 nm. The SiV
centers are excited using a tunable (670-1000 nm) cw
Ti:sapphire laser with a line width below 4 MHz (Sirah,
Matisse) which enables non-resonant excitation at 700
nm and resonant excitation at 737 nm. The laser fre-
quency can be scanned mode hop free over a range of
30 GHz. For spectral hole burning experiments, a home-

built, tunable external cavity diode laser (ECDL) with
a line width below 10 MHz is used as an additional ex-
citation source. Both laser frequencies are monitored by
a wavemeter with 50 MHz relative resolution (High Fi-
nesse, WS6/200). The ECDL frequency is actively sta-
bilized to the wavemeter using a PID loop.
PLE spectroscopy is performed by scanning the
Ti:sapphire laser over the ﬁne structure transitions of
the SiV ensemble. The resolution is then given by the
resolution of the wavemeter and no longer limited by the
spectrometer. The emitted photons are detected on the
phonon sideband within a bandwidth of 760-800 nm, en-
abling suppression of the laser light with 750 nm longpass
ﬁlters and preventing the need for complicated ﬁltering
schemes to detect the signal on the ZPL. Although the
detected sideband intensity under non-resonant excita-
tion is about two magnitudes weaker as compared to the
ZPL, this detection method still gives high count rates
due to the high eﬃciency of the resonant excitation.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Low temperature PLE spectrum

We ﬁrst measure the low temperature PLE spectrum of
the SiV ensemble at 5 K, which is shown in Figure 2. We
observe the characteristic ﬁne structure of the SiV center
with two strong doublets, which conﬁrms the high crystal
quality and low strain environment of our sample. The
peaks have a linewidth of about 10 GHz and we deter-
mine the ground (excited) state splitting to be 48.3± 0.7
GHz (256.7 ± 0.8 GHz) (see table I). Comparing the in-
tensities of the diﬀerent subensembles visible in Figure
2, e.g. C:C(cid:48):C(cid:48)(cid:48), we ﬁnd a ratio of 92.3:4.34:2.31, being
nearly identical to the natural abundance of silicon iso-
topes 28Si:29Si:30Si of 92.2:4.7:3.1. This is clear evidence
that the color center is created by silicon. All these re-
sults are in very good agreement with the literature.8,9,21

B. Temperature-dependent measurements

By varying the temperature from 5 K up to room tem-
perature, we investigate the temperature dependence of
the SiV ﬁne structure spectrum. As displayed in Fig-
ure 3, the ﬁne structure peaks experience a broadening

nated by four strong peaks with individual linewidths of about
10 GHz arising from the electronic structure of the SiV cen-
ter. Additional peaks are attributed to subensembles created
by diﬀerent silicon isotopes.

of the linewidth at higher temperatures. Above 60 K,
the four line structure merges into two lines, and from
130 K on the ﬁne structure is no longer visible. Addi-
tionally, the lines are blue-shifted more than 1 nm upon
cooling down, as has been observed earlier using PLE22
or photoluminescence spectroscopy(PL).11 The extracted
linewidths for the main peaks B and C and the line shift
for peak C are shown in Figure 4. For temperatures
below 130 K, the spectra were ﬁtted using a Voigt pro-
ﬁle, showing both Gaussian and Lorentzian components.
For temperatures above 130 K, measurements (as shown
in Fig. 4) were performed using the spectrometer since
the linewidths are well above its resolution limit and a
Lorentzian proﬁle was used to ﬁt the data.

Both inhomogeneous and homogeneous line broaden-
ing are responsible for the observed linewidth. As the
linewidth is nearly constant in the range of 5-20 K (see
Fig.
4(a)), we assume that at low temperatures the
broadening is dominated by temperature-independent in-
homogeneous broadening due to residual strain in our
sample. On the other hand, the homogeneous broaden-
ing is temperature-dependent and caused by quadratic
electron phonon coupling.
In reference to our earlier
work (see Neu et al.11), where a detailed discussion of
line broadening and shifting mechanisms is given, but a
considerable eﬀort had to be taken to account for the
spectrometer resolution limit, we can now analyse the
homogeneous line broadening using the high resolution
data obtained by PLE spectroscopy. Several theoretical
dependencies on the temperature T have been proposed:
Hizhnyakov et al.23–25 derive a aT 3 + bT 7 dependence

of the SiV ensemble. The four line ﬁne structure only devel-
ops below 60 K. The peak positions are blue-shifted at lower
temperatures. Oscillations in the spectra at higher temper-
atures are caused by residual laser power ﬂuctuations in one
mode hop free scanning range of 30 GHz. All spetra have been
corrected for laser power ﬂuctuations throughout the scans.

in the presence of degenerate electronic states, verifying
a dominant T 3 dependence for a NV center ensemble.
They also deduce a T 5 dependence using perturbation
theory in the presence of a dynamic Jahn-Teller eﬀect.
A T 3 dependence is attributed to phonon interactions
with other defects in the crystal and is observed in the
presence of strong inhomogeneous broadening.26 Consid-
ering these possibilities, we ﬁt our data with a T 3, T 5 and
T 7 dependence (see Fig. 4(a)), taking into account the
contribution of the constant inhomogeneous broadening.
In good agreement with our earlier results, we ﬁnd that
the T 3 dependence indeed gives the best approximation
to our data. Using a polynomial aT 3 + bT 5 + cT 7 ﬁts the
temperature-dependent linewidth very well and results
in a dominant T 3 term. The concurrence of a dominant
T 3 contribution to the temperature-dependent homoge-
neous broadening and a strong inhomogeneous broad-
ening at low temperatures is in agreement with earlier
theoretical predictions.26 Recent measurements of single
SiV centers in a high quality sample not showing inho-
mogeneous broadening also conﬁrm the T 3 dependence
for temperatures above 20 K.22 These measurements also
show an additional contribution proportional to T at low
temperatures <20 K. As this contribution is small (<500
MHz) it is masked by the inhomogeneous broadening
in our sample. The blue shift of the ZPL is a conse-
quence of lattice contraction during cooling, leading to
a temperature-dependent bandgap in diamond, and of
quadratic electron-phonon coupling (for details, refer to
Neu et al.11). Hizhnyakov et al.23–25 derive a aT 2 + bT 4
dependence, which we use to ﬁt the measured line shift
(see Fig. 4(b)) and which leads to a slightly better ﬁt

However, due to the inhomogeneous broadening, the
measured linewidth of the SiV ensemble is two orders
of magnitude larger than the lifetime limit. To deter-
mine the underlying homogeneous broadening, we em-
ploy spectral hole burning spectroscopy. The ECDL is
used as pump laser and its frequency is ﬁxed to the
center of one of the ﬁne structure transitions, thereby
saturating a homogeneous subensemble of the inhomoge-
neous broadened transition. The Ti:sapphire laser is then
scanned across the transition as weak probe laser. When
both lasers are in resonance (νpump − νprobe = 0), we ob-
serve a sharp dip in the ﬂuorescence signal, whose width
corresponds to the homogeneous linewidth for low exci-
tation powers. Figure 5 shows the spectral hole burning
signal of peak C, featuring a hole with a linewidth of 346
MHz. This linewidth is subject to power broadening. By
performing the measurement at diﬀerent excitation pow-
ers, we extrapolate a linewidth of 279 ± 16 MHz for van-
ishing excitation power. Similar results are obtained for
transition D. Witnessing these homogeneous linewidths
close to the lifetime limit, we conclude that reaching the
lifetime limit might be possible for single emitters in a
very low strain sample (see also results in Sec. III D).

D. Single emitter spectroscopy

To test this assumption, we investigate the SIL arrays
on the implanted sample and ﬁnd bright emitters with
count rates on the order of 105 cps in photoluminescence.

than the T 3 dependence recently observed by Jahnke et
al.22 The high resolution of the PLE measurement en-
ables us to conﬁrm a good agreement of the ﬁt with the
data also for small shifts at low temperatures, a region
not accessible to the spectrometer, and to support our
earlier ﬁndings.

C. Spectral hole burning in SiV ensemble

For use in many quantum applications, one requires
indistinguishable photons, i.e. fourier- or lifetime-limited
photons. According to the equation27 ∆νlifetime = 1
2πτ ,
the lifetime-limited linewidth is on the order of 100-150
MHZ for typical SiV center lifetimes of 1-1.7 ns. The
lifetime of the investigated SiV ensemble is determined
to be 1.6 ns at 5 K by using pulsed laser excitation and
time correlated single photon counting, corresponding to
a lifetime-limited linewidth of 100 MHz. This is in good
agreement with 1.7 ns observed for single SiV centers at

we obtain an anti-bunching dip below 0.5, proving sin-
gle photon emission. Figure 6 shows the PLE spectrum
of this emitter at 10K. Despite using very low excitation
powers, power broadening of the lines is still present. We
extrapolate the linewidths for vanishing excitation power
and obtain values of 270 resp. 277 MHz for transitions C
and D and of 575 MHz for transitions A and B. The re-
sults for transitions C and D are in good agreement with
the spectral hole burning results found for the SiV en-
semble and diﬀer from the lifetime limit by only a factor
of about 2. The larger linewidth of the transitions A and
B is attributed to a shorter lifetime of the upper excited
state due to fast decay into the lower excited state.12
To verify the absence of inhomogeneous broadening, we
again perform spectral hole burning measurements. As
Figure 7 shows for transition C, the peak is completely
saturated by the pump laser and therefore no longer vis-
ible when scanning with the probe laser. The lines can
therefore only be homogeneously broadened. These re-
sults are conﬁrmed by the recent demonstration of nar-
row linewidth single SiV centers by Rogers et al.12, where
linewidths of 120-130 MHz have been measured for tran-
sitions C,D and 350-410 MHz for transitions A,B.

We assume that the slightly larger linewidths in our
samples are due to residual strain. To verify this assump-
tion, we investigate several single SiV centers and observe
that the linewidth varies with the ground state splitting
for diﬀerent centers. To explain the observed variation,
we use a model analogous to the model of Jahnke et.
al.22, where the linewidth γ depends on the ground state
splitting ∆ and the level occupation probability in the
following way: γ = A 2π ∆3(exp(¯h∆/kBT ) − 1)−1, with
A as a free parameter (see Fig. 8, solid data points and
ﬁtting curve). The change in linewidth can be related to
a change in the decoherence rate within the ground and
excited state manifold. For small splittings, the decoher-
ence rate increases cubically with the phonon density of
states and so does the linewidth. For larger splittings,
however, the excitation probability drops exponentially
with the increasing splitting. At around 275 GHz, the
exponential part starts to dominate and therefore the
linewidth peaks around this value. For even larger split-
tings, the linewidth decreases again due to the dominant
exponential term. Such large state splittings can occur
for emitters exhibiting a strong crystal strain which acts
on the states similarly to the Jahn-Teller eﬀect discussed
in Ref. 6. A detailed discussion of the eﬀects of crys-
tal strain on the electronic properties of the SiV will be
published elsewhere. We note, however, that not all data
points are covered by this simple model (see data point
labeled with open circle in Fig. 8) indicating that the
inﬂuence of strain on the electronic levels and their co-
herence might be more complex. In summary, we con-
clude that our implanted sample is an environment with
larger strain as compared to the CVD-grown sample used
by Rogers et al.12, which explains the slightly broader
linewidths.

Another important prerequisite for quantum informa-
tion processing is the availability of coherent interactions
between electronic/spin states. By modifying our spec-
tral hole burning experiments such that we ﬁx the ECDL
frequency on transition C and scan the second laser over
the transition D, we can drive a Λ-scheme (Fig. 9(a)) in
the SiV ensemble. As soon as the laser detuning equals
the ground state splitting, a dip in the ﬂuorescence in-
tensity occurs, which is clear evidence of an coherent in-
teraction, i.e. zero B-ﬁeld coherent population trapping
(CPT). A similar experiment for single SiV centers in
the implanted sample recently demonstrated CPT be-
tween Zeeman-split levels in strong magnetic ﬁelds pro-
viding access to electron spin-coherence times.14 With
these results and the recently observed spin-conserving
transitions for single SiV centers13, all-optical access and
control of orbital or spin degrees of freedom in single SiV
centers seems feasible. However, our results highlight the
importance of using SiV centers in a low strain environ-
ment for such experiments to avoid the detrimental in-
ﬂuence of decoherence. To demonstrate this, we perform
a CPT measurement for a strained SiV center (emitter
labeled with red data point in Fig. 8). As Figure 10
shows, no CPT dip is visible, which we attribute to the
increased decoherence rate.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we investigated the low temperature
spectral properties of a high quality SiV center ensem-
ble under resonant excitation. The high resolution of
the PLE allows us to perform a detailed analysis of the
temperature-dependent linewidth and line shift, espe-
cially for low temperatures. We demonstrate linewidths
close to the lifetime-limit for an ensemble of SiV centers
by eliminating inhomogeneous broadening using spectral
hole burning and conﬁrm these results by showing nearly
lifetime-limited lines for single SiV centers. Furthermore,
we linked the decoherence rate to strain in the sample
by relating the ground state splitting to the linewidth
and showed the negative eﬀect of increased decoherence
on CPT measurements. These results together with the
observation of coherent processes prove the potential of
both single SiV centers and SiV ensembles for applica-
tions in quantum information.
