Abstract

We calculate the high and low scale threshold corrections to the D = 6 proton de-
cay mode in supersymmetric SU (5) grand uniﬁed theories with higher-dimensional
representation Higgs multiplets. In particular, we focus on a missing-partner model
in which the grand uniﬁed group is spontaneously broken by the 75-dimensional
Higgs multiplet and the doublet-triplet splitting problem is solved. We ﬁnd that in
the missing-partner model the D = 6 proton decay rate gets suppressed by about
60%, mainly due to the threshold eﬀect at the GUT scale, while the SUSY-scale
threshold corrections are found to be less prominent when sfermions are heavy.

Introduction

Grand uniﬁed theories (GUTs) are attractive candidates for physics beyond the standard
model (SM). The uniﬁcation of the SM gauge groups SU(3)C × SU(2)L × U(1)Y provides
a uniﬁed description both of gauge interactions and of matter ﬁelds. Besides, supersym-
metry (SUSY) indicates the precise uniﬁcation of the SM gauge couplings at the energy
scale ∼ 1016 GeV [1–4] and provides a candidate for dark matter. The discovery of a
scalar boson with the mass of 126 GeV [5–7] is consistent with the expectations for the
SM Higgs boson. In spite of eﬀorts to ﬁnd deviations from the SM predictions and/or
direct detection of the SUSY particles at the LHC run-2 experiments, no such signal has
been found so far, see for instance ATLAS and CMS collaborations reports in Refs. [8–13].
Indirect measurements of rare decays or rare processes are useful to constrain new
physics.
In particular, SUSY GUTs generically predict nucleon decays by exchanging
an additional gauge boson called the X boson (D = 6 decay) or a color-triplet Higgs
multiplet (D = 5 decay). In this paper we will assume that the R-parity violating (D = 4
decay) mode is absent or at least negligible.

Regarding the D = 5 decay mode it is well-known that the minimal renormalizable
SUSY SU(5) GUT in the low-scale SUSY scenario (superpartners typically around 1 TeV)
has been excluded by predicting a too short lifetime [14, 15]. Several ways to relax this
severe constraint have been considered. For example, imposing the Peccei-Quinn (PQ)
symmetry [16], one can suppress the baryon-number violating terms in the superpotential
[17, 18]. Similarly, in the high-scale SUSY [19] or split SUSY scenario [20–22], large
sfermion masses reduce the Wilson coeﬃcients of the four-Fermi operators responsible for
nucleon decay via the color-triplet Higgs multiplet [23,24]. Another possible way to avoid
a too fast proton decay rate is to use higher dimensional operators to increase the GUT
and triplet scales [25–28] and/or to suppress the color triplet Yukawa couplings without
aﬀecting the fermion masses [28, 29]. Last but not least, models originating from higher
spacetime dimensions can make use of continuum or discrete symmetries to completely
or partially suppress the D = 5 mode [30–33]. The bottom line is that the D = 5 decay
mode is potentially dangerous but very model dependent.

An opposite situation is with the D = 6 mode, which is on one side typically slower
than the D = 5 one, but on the other side more predictive, less model dependent. In this
paper we will consider in detail this mode. The results will thus be particularly interesting
for models in which for some reason the D = 5 mode is negligible and the D = 6 one
dominates.

The main proton decay mode via the D = 6 gauge interaction is into a neutral pion
and a positron. For this decay mode various next-to-leading order corrections have been
considered: the two-loop renormalization-group equations (RGEs) for the Wilson coeﬃ-
cients in MSSM [34] and SM [35], below the electroweak (EW) scale [36], and the one-loop
threshold corrections at the GUT scale in the minimal SUSY SU(5) model [37]. However,
such corrections are not available for extended SUSY GUT models, which are motivated by
the solution to the doublet-triplet splitting problem. These models typically employ large
Higgs representations, so threshold corrections are expected to be particularly important.

1

Since the anomalous dimensions include only gauge couplings at the next-to-leading order,
we will focus in the following only on the threshold corrections by gauge interactions.

In this paper we will estimate the threshold eﬀect in SUSY SU(5) GUT models with
negligible proton decay via the color-triplet Higgs exchange. As mentioned above, this
can be easily obtained for example by imposing a global symmetry such as PQ symmetry.
On top of that a light (below the GUT scale) color triplet is typically needed for exact
uniﬁcation [15]. A complete model with both ingredients is the missing-partner model
[38,39]: it naturally solves the doublet-triplet splitting problem of the SUSY SU(5) GUT
since the 5 (5) Higgs multiplet only couples to the 50 (50) multiplet which however does
not contain the doublet partner of 5 (5). Since the adjoint 24 cannot couple 5 with
50 (it does couple 5 with 45 [40] though), a higher dimensional adjoint 75 is needed.
Then this Higgs multiplet spontaneously breaks the uniﬁed gauge symmetry into the SM
gauge groups. As a result, there are a large number of ﬁelds contributing to the vacuum
polarization of the X-boson supermultiplet and hence the threshold correction at the GUT
scale may aﬀect a precise predictions of proton lifetime. A similar analysis was carried
out for the D = 5 decay mode in the context of SUSY SO(10) GUTs in [41], where it
was concluded that the huge number of ﬁelds involved sensibly aﬀects the wavefunction
renormalization factor.

The current status of the nucleon decay experiments is as follows: the partial lifetime
limit on p → π0e+ is τ (p → π0e+) > 1.67 × 1034 years, and the bound on the partial
lifetime for p → K +ν is τ (p → K +ν) > 6.6 × 1033 years [42]. It is expected that a future
experiment, the Hyper-Kamiokande, may achieve a sensitivity of 5-10 times the present
bound.

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we brieﬂy introduce both the minimal
and the missing-partner set-up of the renormalizable SUSY SU(5) GUT. In Section 3,
we show the one-loop threshold corrections to the baryon-number violating dimension-
six operators at the GUT scale. We estimate them at the GUT scale in the minimal
SUSY SU(5) and the missing-partner SU(5) models, and then compare the numerical
results for threshold eﬀects in each models in Section 4. Finally, we summarize this paper
in Section 5. For completeness, in Appendix A, we derive threshold corrections at the
SUSY scale and compute their numerical values. In Appendix B, we list the threshold
contributions from the irreducible representations with the Dynkin index below that of
the 75-dimensional multiplet. In Appendix C, we give the interaction terms including
the GUT-breaking vacuum expectation values (VEVs) in the cases of the adjoint Higgs
multiplet and the 75-dimensional Higgs multiplet.

2 Models

To begin with, we brieﬂy review the minimal renormalizable SUSY SU(5) GUTs. The
matter supermultiplets are completely embedded in the 5 + 10 representation for each

are the SU(3)C and SU(2)L indeces, respectively.
i = 1, 2, 3 denotes the generation.
The component superﬁelds describe the chiral superﬁelds of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM); DC, U C and EC are the right-handed charge conjugated down-
type, up-type, and charged lepton superﬁelds, while Q and L denote the left-handed
quark and lepton doublet superﬁelds, respectively. A square bracket [. . . ] represents
antisymmetric indices.

In the Higgs sector, two types of Higgs multiplets are required. One is the Higgs
multiplet including the MSSM Higgs multiplets which are needed for the electroweak
symmetry breaking. The MSSM Higgs multiplets are embedded in the minimal SU(5)
into the 5 + 5 (denoted by H and H) and are so accompanied with the color-triplet
Higgs multiplets. The other, additional, Higgs multiplet spontaneously breaks the GUT
gauge group. In the minimal SUSY SU(5) GUT, this role is played by the adjoint 24-
dimensional Higgs multiplet (denoted by ΣA
B), which ﬁelds are either eaten by the heavy
X gauge boson (the would-be Nambu-Goldstone ﬁelds) or are typically heavy.

The superpotential in the Higgs sector depends on the particle content. As we said
above, in the minimal setup of the SUSY SU(5), the Higgs sector is only composed of
the 5 + 5 Higgs multiplets and the adjoint Higgs multiplet. The superpotential in the
minimal renormalizable SUSY SU(5) is

to give GUT-breaking mass to the color-triplet Higgs multiplets via couplings with 75-

and so can break SU(5) to SM. In the following we will denote it by Σ[AB]
[CD]. The dangerous
D = 5 proton decay operators are suppressed by imposing a PQ symmetry [18]. We thus
introduce in this model two 50 + 50 pairs (denoted by Θ, Θ, Θ′, Θ

Already the large Dynkin index of 75 implies a non-asymptotically free theory above the
GUT scale. Additional 50 + 50 pairs would lead to the Landau pole between the GUT
and Planck scales. By itself this may not be a problem, and could signal the presence of
a non-perturbative UV ﬁxed point [43, 44], although in supersymmetry this may not be
easy to obtain [45]. To simplify the analysis we will assume in the following a perturbative
GUT all the way to the Planck scale. This means that the masses of 50 + 50 pairs must
be at the gravitational scale (M1 = M2 = MPl).

In the minimal SUSY SU(5) the adjoint Higgs multiplet ΣA

B (A, B = 1,· · · , 5) obtains

even if the PQ symmetry is imposed [18]. In this paper we adopt this model as a prototype model with
higher-dimensional representation Higgs multiplets.

the mass of the X boson equals MX = 2√6g5v75. We also ﬁnd easily v75 = 3m75/2λ75 by
imposing F -term conditions.

Let us consider the mass spectra for the other ﬁelds in each model. In the minimal
SUSY SU(5) GUT model, the adjoint Higgs multiplet is decomposed into the color-octet,
the weak-triplet, the SM singlet, and the would-be Nambu-Goldstone multiplets. The
octet and triplet have the same mass MΣ = 5m24/2, while the SM singlet has the mass
of MΣ/5. The color triplets obtain the mass of MHC = 5λv24 after symmetry breaking.

The GUT-breaking VEV of the 75-dimensional Higgs multiplet also gives rise to the
mass splitting among its components. The full spectrum is shown in Table 2. The color

In order to break the PQ symmetry, we should introduce a pair of SU(5) singlets P

3 Threshold Correction at the GUT Scale

In this section, we estimate the vacuum polarization function in the extended SU(5)
GUT models. As mentioned in Section 1, we only focus on the gauge interaction since
the calculation of only two-loop RGEs are carried out. The other threshold corrections,
such as vertex and box corrections at the GUT scale, have been estimated in [37]. While
vertex and box corrections are independent from the Higgs sector of the GUT scale, the
vacuum polarization of X boson is aﬀected by them. Before we focus on the vacuum
polarization of the X-boson vector superﬁelds, we summarize the threshold corrections at
the GUT scale.

The eﬀective K¨ahler potential for dimension-six operators is given by

with operators O(i) (i = 1, 2) deﬁned as

O(2) = ǫαβγǫrsEC†U C † αQrβQsγ,

Here MX denotes the mass of the X boson and ΣX (0) is the correction to the X-boson
mass. The ﬁrst term for each λ(i)
GUT arises from the vacuum polarization of the X boson,
while the second term describes the correction from box and vertex diagrams.

The renormalized two-point function for the X boson is given by

Γ(2)
X (p2) = p2 − M 2

X − ΣX (p2),

(17)

where p2 is the X-boson momentum square. Here we adopt the on-shell scheme for the
X-boson mass,

ΣX(p2) = ΣX (p2) − ΣX (M 2
X),

(18)

while we use the DR scheme otherwise. Particles with the SU(5) invariant mass much
heavier than the X-boson mass get decoupled from ΣX (0) under the on-shell scheme.

The three diagrams in Fig. 1 contribute to the radiative corrections to the X-vector
multiplet two-point function from the (massive) chiral superﬁelds. After picking the
transverse mode and regularizing the UV divergence, we obtain the ﬁnite correction to
the two-point function from the diagram (a) in Fig. 1 as follows:

this does not contribute to ΣX (p2).

Let us now discuss the contributions to the vacuum polarization of the X-boson vec-
tor superﬁeld coming from diﬀerent representations. First, the ﬁelds in the irreducible
representation of SU(5) are decomposed into irreducible representations of the SM gauge
groups. We give the SM decomposition of some GUT multiplets in Appendix B. The

where superscript Rep. indicates the SU(5) representation, such as 5+5, 10+10, 24, and
so on. i, j = 1,· · · , N (i, j = 1,· · · , N) denote the labels of irreducible representations of
the SM gauge groups (and its complex representation). We neglect the p2-independent
terms since we take the on-mass shell condition for the vacuum polarization of the X-
boson superﬁeld. The vacuum polarization coeﬃcients ai and bij are determined by the
interactions between the X-boson superﬁeld and the corresponding chiral superﬁelds.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (24) comes from the gauge interaction between the X-boson
and (anti-)chiral superﬁelds. The mass eigenvalue of the chiral superﬁeld in the loop is
denoted by Mi. We show the vacuum polarization coeﬃcients bij in Table 3 for some

SU(5) representations. The bij not listed in Table 3 are zero. Note that the missing-
partner model [18] includes 50 + 50 pairs to induce the masses of color-triplet Higgs
multiplets. However, these multiplets do not contribute to the vacuum polarization of
the X-boson since we assumed their vector-like mass to be at the Planck scale in order
to keep the theory in the perturbative regime. Here, we list bij from 5 + 5, 24, and 75
representations. In Appendix B, we display bij only from SU(5) representations, whose
Dynkin indices are smaller than the Dynkin index of the 75 representation.

The SM decomposition of 5, 24, and 75 representations is given by

Here, the subscripts of φi correspond to the labels in Eq. (24).

The second term in Eq. (24) arises from the interactions involving the GUT-breaking
VEV. Thus, ai = 0 is satisﬁed if there is no SM singlet component in the irreducible
representation of SU(5). We choose the Feynman-t’ Hooft gauge throughout this paper.
Then the Nambu-Goldstone superﬁelds have the same mass as the X boson. Since the
internal lines in the diagram (c) of Fig. 1 include either X-boson vector superﬁelds or the
Nambu-Goldstone chiral superﬁelds, the loop function A always has MX -dependence.

The interaction terms with the GUT-breaking VEV v24 or v75 are given in Appendix C.
In Table 3, the coeﬃcients ai from the 24 and 75 chiral superﬁelds are listed. The ai not
listed in Table 3 are zero. a0 corresponds to the contribution from the Nambu-Goldstone
(NG) supermultiplets and MSSM vector supermultiplets, while ai (i = 1, 2,· · · ) arise
from the massive vector supermultiplet and chiral supermultiplet loop diagrams. Since
the MSSM vector superﬁelds are massless, M0 = 0 is satisﬁed.

4 Numerical Results

Let’s now estimate the threshold eﬀects on the proton lifetime. We deﬁne the ratio of the
proton decay rates as

(27)

Here λ(i) denotes the sum of threshold corrections at the scales where the heavy particles
are integrated out.

For completeness we need to include the threshold correction at the SUSY scale. The
explicit formulae for the SUSY threshold correction are given in Appendix A. From there
we conclude that their eﬀect is vanishing if sparticles are degenerate in mass, but even
with a large mass hierarchy between sfermions and gauginos it is only about a few percent.
Let us consider now the eﬀect of the additional ﬁelds at the GUT scale. The precise
prediction for proton lifetime depends on the uniﬁed coupling and the mass spectrum
at the GUT scale. In particular, the GUT mass spectrum and the value of the uniﬁed
gauge coupling are connected through the threshold corrections to the gauge couplings at
the GUT scale [47, 48]. Thus by requiring gauge coupling uniﬁcation we get a constraint
on the mass spectrum of the GUT particles through threshold corrections. At the GUT
scale, the one-loop matching conditions for gauge couplings are given as

where gi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the SM gauge couplings and λi (i = 1, 2, 3) denotes threshold
corrections for gauge couplings. The threshold corrections λi depend on the details of the
GUT particles mass spectrum. For the minimal renormalizable SUSY SU(5) GUT, the

We treat the mass of the X boson as a free parameter in the following numerical cal-

determine the mass of the color triplet MHC from Eq. (29) and that of the adjoint Higgs

When we estimate the partial proton lifetime in each model, we use the proton decay
matrix elements calculated by the lattice simulation at 2 GeV [49]. Note that the uniﬁed
coupling g5 in the missing-partner model is larger than the one in the minimal SU(5).
This is due to two reasons: 1) the combination M 2
X MΣ in the missing-partner model is
slightly smaller than that in the minimal SU(5) due to the constant term and, 2) there
are many components of 75 contributing to the threshold correction to gauge couplings.
The threshold corrections from vertex and box contributions depend only on MX and
g5 in the context of the SUSY SU(5) GUTs, and these values are of order 10−2 [37]. Let
us consider the model dependence of the threshold eﬀect, which appears in the vacuum
polarization of the X boson. As we ignore the GUT scale mass dependence, a part of the
vacuum polarization is proportional to the one-loop beta function for the uniﬁed coupling.
Thus, the contribution from the gauge supermultiplet dominates the vacuum polarization
in the minimal SUSY SU(5). On the other hand, since there exist many massive ﬁelds in
the missing-partner model, the contribution from the chiral supermultiplets is enhanced,
and then the vacuum polarization is dominated by the chiral supermultiplets. There-
fore, the resulting threshold eﬀects can vary among GUT models due to the relative sign
between the contributions from the gauge and the chiral supermultiplets. Notice that,
practically, we include other contributions, such as vertex contributions, box contribu-
tions, vacuum polarizations which arise from interactions including GUT breaking VEV,
and we include the eﬀect of mass splitting.

If we estimate the masses of the Higgs multiplets by using Eqs. (31)-(32) with MX lying
around 1016 GeV, all components can be lighter than the X boson in the missing-partner
model. The 75-dimensional Higgs multiplet has a number of component ﬁelds with mass
diﬀerent from the matching (GUT) scale , and thus there can be a large contribution of
the threshold correction to the proton lifetime. As a result, the proton decay rate in the
missing-partner model is suppressed about 60% with MX = 2.0 × 1016 GeV as we show
in Table 4.

5 Conclusion and Discussion

In this study, we have evaluated the threshold corrections to the proton decay operators
giving rise to p → π0e+, especially those induced by the higher-dimensional representation
Higgs multiplets. The structure of the Higgs sector in the extended GUT models appears
in the vacuum polarization of the X boson. As the threshold corrections depend on the
choice of the high-energy model, we have focused on the missing-partner model which
solves the doublet-triplet problem in SU(5). In this model, the Higgs sector eﬀectively
contains the 75-dimensional Higgs multiplet and two 5 + 5 pairs below the Planck scale.
We have determined the mass spectrum at the GUT scale according to the low energy
gauge coupling constants, ﬁxing some mass parameters such as the X-boson mass. In such
a case, many multiplets acquire masses around 1015 GeV through the GUT symmetry
breaking. Since the size of the uniﬁed gauge coupling is determined including threshold
corrections, these mass diﬀerences make the coupling large. As a result, due to the small
masses and the large coupling, the contributions of all these multiplets sum up to a
correction of about 60 % to the proton lifetime.

We have not considered the threshold corrections from Yukawa couplings in this study.
This is because no two-loop RGE analysis including Yukawa couplings for the baryon-
number violating operators is available. Although this eﬀect is not expected to be sizable
due to the smallness of the Yukawa (except the top Yukawa), it should be included sooner
or later to complete the two-loop level analysis.

Finally, we comment on the remaining uncertainty in the precise determination of the
proton lifetime. The matrix elements of p → π0e+ is evaluated with lattice QCD, and
they have at present around 30% uncertainty [49].

Appendix

A Threshold Correction at the SUSY Scale

In this appendix, we derive the threshold corrections of the dimension-six operators at
the SUSY scale. We focus only on gauge interactions.

Two-Point Function

Now, we estimate the threshold corrections to the two-point function of fermions. After
picking the UV divergence, we obtain the two-point function of SM fermions ψ including
the one-loop ﬁnite corrections as follows:

(35)

Γψ
0 ≡ /p−mψ denotes the tree-level two-point function of ψ with pµ the four-momentum and
mψ the tree level mass. Ma and mφ are the masses of the gaugino and the superpartners
of ψ, respectively. The second term arises from the gaugino-sfermion loop and the third
term describes the contribution from the SM loops. ga and Ca(N) are the SM gauge
coupling and the Casimir invariant, respectively. For the SU(N) gauge theory, Ca(N) =
(N 2 − 1)/2N, and for the U(1)Y gauge theory, Ca(N) = Y 2. The loop function f is
deﬁned as

f (x, y) ≡ 2Z 1

0

ds(1 − s) ln [sx + (1 − s)y] .

(36)

Here, all mass parameters are normalized by µ which denotes the renormalization scale. It
is easily found that f (x, x) = 1
2 ln x, which corresponds to the case of degenerate masses.

In the SM, the one-loop corrected two-point function has the form

SM = [1 − λψ + (SM contributions)] iΓψ
iΓψ
0 ,

(37)

where λψ denotes the one-loop threshold correction to the two-point function of ψ. Then,
we get λψ after matching the two-point functions in the two theories:

λψ (ψ = q, l, u, d, e) is deﬁned in Eq. (38), and describes the one-loop threshold corrections
to the two-point functions of the SM chiral fermions.

Numerical Evaluation

In the last section of this appendix we evaluate the threshold eﬀects at the SUSY scale in
the split SUSY scenario. As mentioned in the introduction, the heavy sfermion scenario
makes the constraint on a dimension-ﬁve proton decay mild. We assume that all sparticles
except gauginos are degenerate at mass MS. Gaugino masses are set to be as follows:
the bino and wino are degenerate in mass M1 = M2 = 3 TeV, and we treat the ratio
of the gluino and bino masses as a free parameter.
In the numerical estimate, we set
M3/M1 = 1, 3, and 9. We also choose tan β = 3 since a small tan β is preferred to get the
observed Higgs mass in the heavy sfermion scenario [21, 22, 50]. The matching scale for
the proton decay amplitudes is set to be the sfermion mass scale MS.

We show the MS dependence of the ratio of decay rates with and without SUSY
threshold correction in Fig. 3. The ratio of decay rates is deﬁned similarly as in Eq. (26).
The denominator of Eq. (26) includes only the threshold correction at the GUT scale
while the numerator also includes those at the SUSY scale. We see these threshold eﬀects
at the SUSY scale in Fig. 3, where the minimal SU(5) model with all mass parameters
and the GUT scale ﬁxed at 2 × 1016 GeV is considered. Let’s add few comments.
First, if all sparticles are degenerate in mass, there is no contribution from the thresh-
old corrections. This is because the loop functions f and F behave as follows (µ = MS)

Figure 3: Ratio of the proton decay rate with and without the threshold correction at

set to be 3 TeV, and solid, broken, and dotted lines respectively indicate M3/M1 = 1, 3,
and 9.

in the limit of MS ≫ Ma. In Fig. 3, the ratio R is larger than 10% when M3/M1 = 3, 9
and MS ∼ O(1) TeV. This is because we take the matching scale at MS which is smaller
than the gaugino masses.
In this case we should take the matching scale somewhere
between the sfermion and gaugino mass in order to minimize the 2-loop corrections.

As a result, we conclude that there is only a few % correction to proton decay lifetime

in the split SUSY scenario.

B Field Decomposition

The K¨ahler potential for Φ in the SU(5) irreducible representation is decomposed as
follows;

K = Φ†Φ =Xi

φ†
i φi.

(47)

Here, φi transforms as an irreducible representation under the SM gauge groups. Φ† and
φ† denote the anti-chiral superﬁelds. In this section, we turn oﬀ gauge interactions for
simplicity.

In Table 5, we give the SM decomposition of the SU(5) irreducible representations,
whose Dynkin indices are below that of 75 representation. In this table, square brackets
[· · · ] represent antisymmetric indices while braces {· · ·} represent symmetric indices.
We summarize the vacuum polarization coeﬃcients bij, deﬁned in Eq. (24), from the
above-mentioned irreducible representations. In Table 6, bij from each representations are

C The Interaction Terms Including VEVs

In this appendix, we give information about the interaction terms including GUT-breaking
VEVs, which are needed to calculate the vacuum polarization coeﬃcient ai in Table 3.
The normalization of component ﬁelds follows the deﬁnition in the previous appendix.

For an adjoint multiplet ΦA

B, the K¨ahler potential is given by

K24 = Φ†A

B obtains the GUT-breaking VEV, which is given as Eq. (5), giving the X boson a mass

ΦA
MX = 5g5v24. The interaction terms induced by the K¨ahler potential are given by

Here, the non-Abelian MSSM vector supermultiplets are denoted as G → Gα
and W → W r
and SU(2)L. We also deﬁne (A · B) = ǫabAaBb.

s = √2W a(ta)r

For a 75 representation Φ[AB]

[CD], the K¨ahler potential is given by

K75 = Φ†[AB]

The GUT-breaking VEV of Φ(AB)
(CD) is given in Eq. (7). The X boson becomes massive with
MX = 2√6g5v75 after we substitute the VEV for Φ and Φ†, while the interaction terms
proportional to the VEV are
