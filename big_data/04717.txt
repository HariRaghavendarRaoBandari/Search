We prove that every non-abelian ﬁnite simple group is generated by an involution and

an element of prime order.

1. Introduction

Given a ﬁnite simple group G, it is natural to ask which elements generate G. Results
of Miller ([26]), Steinberg ([33]), Aschbacher and Guralnick ([2]) prove that any ﬁnite simple
group is generated by a pair of elements. A natural reﬁnement is then to ask whether the
orders of the generating elements may be restricted: given a ﬁnite simple group G and a
pair of integers pa, bq, does there exist a pair of elements x, y P G with x of order a and y of
order b such that G “ xx, yy ? If such a pair exists, we say G is pa, bq-generated.

As two involutions generate a dihedral group, the smallest pair of interest is p2, 3q. The
question of which ﬁnite simple groups are p2, 3q-generated has been studied extensively. All
alternating groups are p2, 3q-generated except in a small number of cases by [26]. All but
ﬁnitely many simple classical groups not equal to P Sp4p2aq, P Sp4p3aq are p2, 3q-generated by
[22]. All simple exceptional groups except for 2B2p22m`1q are p2, 3q-generated by [23]. And
all but four of the sporadic simple groups are p2, 3q-generated by [36].

Nevertheless, the problem of determining exactly which ﬁnite simple groups are p2, 3q-
generated, or more generally p2, pq-generated for some prime p, remains open. In this paper,
we prove:

Theorem 1. Every non-abelian ﬁnite simple group G is generated by an involution and an
element of prime order.

By Zsigmondy’s theorem ([37]), for e, q ą 1 with pe, qq ‰ p2, 2a ´ 1q,p6, 2q, there exists
a prime divisor r of qe ´ 1 such that r does not divide qi ´ 1 for i ă e. We call r a primitive
prime divisor of qe ´ 1. In the group pFrqˆ, q has order e, and so r ” 1 mod e.

1

In view of the p2, pq-generation of alternating groups ([26], [27]), exceptional groups
([23] and Lemma 2.4) and sporadic groups ([36] and Lemma 2.3), Theorem 1 follows from
the following result.

Theorem 2. Let G be ﬁnite simple classical group with natural module of dimension n over
qδ, where δ “ 2 if G is unitary and δ “ 1 otherwise. Then G is p2, pq-generated for some
F
p P t3, 5, ru where r is a primitive prime divisor of qe ´ 1 (if it exists), where e is maximal
such that r | |G|, as listed in Table 1.

We now sketch our approach to proving Theorem 2. Let G and r be as in Theorem 2.
Let M ămax G denote a maximal subgroup. For a group H let impHq denote the number
of elements of order m in H. Let P2,ppGq denote the probability that G is generated by a
random involution and a random element of order p, and let Q2,ppGq “ 1 ´ P2,ppGq. Then
we have

Q2,ppGq ď ÿMămaxG

i2pMq
i2pGq

ippMq
ippGq

,

(1.1)

since the right-hand side is an upper bound for the probability that a random involution
and a random element of order p lie in some maximal subgroup of G. To prove G is p2, pq-
generated, it suﬃces to prove Q2,ppGq ă 1.

If G is such that r does not exist, we prove in Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 that G is
p2, pq-generated for p P t3, 5u using p1.1q. Otherwise let x P G be an element of order r. Let
P2pG, xq denote the probability that G is generated by x and a random involution, and let
Q2pG, xq “ 1 ´ P2pG, xq. Then by similar reasoning we have
i2pMq
.
i2pGq

Q2pG, xq ď ÿxPMămaxG

(1.2)

To prove G is p2, rq-generated, it suﬃces to prove Q2pG, xq ă 1. Our method in most cases
is to list the maximal subgroups M of G containing x, and then bound i2pMq and i2pGq
in terms of n and q such that for n and q suﬃciently large we have Q2pG, xq ă 1. For the
remaining cases with small n and q we improve the bounds case by case using literature such
as [4].

2. Preliminary results

The p2, 3q-generation of classical groups has been studied extensively, and there are

many results for groups of small dimension that we will make use of.

Lemma 2.1. If G is a ﬁnite simple classical group listed in Table 2, then G is p2, 3q-
generated.

We note that there are many other p2, 3q-generation results regarding classical groups, though
our method will not require them.

If G is one of the following groups then r does not exist:

P SL2p2a ´ 1q;
P SU4p2q;
P SL6p2q;
P Sp6p2q;
P Ω`8 p2q.

It will be useful for later sections to prove Theorem 2 holds for some small classical groups,
including the remaining cases where r does not exist.

Lemma 2.2. If G is listed in Table 3, then G is p2, rq-generated.
P Ω`8 p2q, then G is p2, 5q-generated.
Proof. Let G “ P SL3p4q, so r “ 7. By [7] the only maximal subgroups M of G with order
divisible by 7 are isomorphic to P SL2p7q. The index of P SL2p7q in G is 120 and there are 3

If G “ P SU4p2q or

classes of such subgroups. We ﬁnd i2pP SL2p7qq “ 21, i2pGq “ 315, i7pMq “ 48, i7pGq “ 5760.
Therefore by p1.1q,

As discussed in the preamble to Theorem 2, in order to reduce our study of p2, pq-
generation of ﬁnite simple groups to the classical groups we need to prove the result holds
for Suzuki groups and the sporadic groups M11, M22, M23 and M cL.

Lemma 2.3. Let G “ M11, M22, M23 or M cL. Then G is p2, pq-generated, where p is the
largest prime dividing |G|.
Proof. The proof is very similar to that of Lemma 2.2.

Lemma 2.4. Let G “ Szpqq where q “ 22m`1, m ě 1. Then G is p2, 5q-generated.
Proof. We use the description of G found in [32]. We begin by counting involutions and
elements of order 5 in G. We have i2pGq “ pq ´ 1qpq2 ` 1q by [32, Proposition 7], and if
5 | q ` δ?2q ` 1 for δ “ ˘1 we have i5pGq “ q2pq ´ δ?2q ` 1qpq ´ 1q by [32, Proposition 16].

We now consider maximal subgroups M of G with order divisible by 5, and count the
number of involutions and elements of order 5 in M. By Theorems 9 and 10 of [32] we ﬁnd
that if M ămax G and 5 | |M| then either M “ Szpq0q, where qt
0 “ q for some prime t with
q0 ą 2, or M “ Cq`δ?2q`1.4. There is a single G-conjugacy class of each of these groups. If
M is of the ﬁrst type and 5 | q0 ` ǫ?2q0 ` 1 for ǫ “ ˘1 then i2pMq “ pq2
0 ` 1qpq0 ´ 1q and
0pq0 ´ ǫ?2q0 ` 1qpq0 ´ 1q. If M is of the second type then i2pMq “ q ` δ?2q ` 1
i5pMq “ q2
and i5pMq “ 4.

and so for m ě 1 we have Q2,5 ă 1. Therefore G is p2, 5q-generated.

We end the section by stating Proposition 1.3 from [19], which will be useful for later

results.

Proposition 2.5. Let Y be a simple algebraic group over K, an algebraically closed ﬁeld
of characteristic p ą 0, and let N be the number of positive roots in the root system of Y .
Suppose that F is a Frobenius morphism of Y such that G “ pY Fq1 is a ﬁnite simple group
of Lie type over Fq. Assume G is not of type 2F4, 2G2 or 2B2, and deﬁne N2 “ dim Y ´ N.
Then we have

i2pAut Gq ă 2pqN2 ` qN2´1q.

3. Involutions in classical groups

Let G be a ﬁnite simple classical group with natural module of dimension n deﬁned over
qδ, where δ “ 2 if G is unitary and δ “ 1 otherwise. In this section we ﬁnd a lower

the ﬁeld F
bound for i2pGq, the number of involutions in G.
Proposition 3.1. The number of involutions i2pGq ě I2pGq, for I2pGq is given in Table 4.
Proof. For each G we specify an involution y and calculate |yG| to give lower bound for
i2pGq. The choices for y and values |yG| are listed in Table 5. It is then elementary to obtain
the bounds stated in Table 4. We let rds denote an arbitrary group of order d. The notation
of the elements in the table is as follows:

In the case where q is odd, conjugacy class representatives of involutions are found in

Table 5.5.1 of [11], listed alongside information on their respective centralizers.

In the case where q is even and G “ P SLǫ

npqq, involutions are conjugate to jk for
some k. The structures of the centralizers of jk are found in Sections 4 and 6 of [3], and
exact conjugacy class sizes can be calculated using [21, Theorem 7.1]. If q is even and G is
symplectic or orthogonal, involutions are of the form ak, bk or ck with Jordan normal form jk
by [3]. In Sections 7 and 8 of the same paper the structure of the centralizer of each involution
is given, and exact conjugacy class sizes can be calculated using [21, Theorem 7.2].

zǫ P t1, 2u . The values aǫ, zǫ can be found in [17, § 2]. Recall the deﬁnition of r, a primitive
prime divisor of qe ´ 1 for e deﬁned in Theorem 2. By Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 we can
assume r is well-deﬁned.

The subgroup structure of G is well-understood due to a theorem of Aschbacher ([1]).
The theorem states that if M is a maximal subgroup of G, then M lies in a natural collection
C1, . . . , C8, or M P S . Subgroups in Ci are described in detail in [17], where the structure
and number of conjugacy classes are given. Subgroups in class S are almost simple groups
which act absolutely irreducibly on the natural module V of G. The orders of subgroups in
classes C1, . . . , C8 can easily be computed using [17, § 4], and this yields the result below.

Proposition 4.1. Let M be a maximal subgroup of G with order divisible by r, and assume
M lies in one of the Aschbacher classes C1, . . . , C8. Then M is conjugate to a subgroup listed
in Table 6. The number of G-conjugacy classes of each type, cM , is also listed.

Table 6 also lists bounds I2pMq and NM , where i2pMq ď I2pMq and NM ď |NMpxxyq|
where x P G is an element of order r contained in M. These bounds are justiﬁed in Propo-
sition 5.1 and Proposition 6.4.

The subgroups M P S with order divisible by r are given by [13]. We ﬁrst list these
subgroups with socpMq P Liepp1q, where Liepp1q is the set of ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type
with characteristic not equal to p.

bounds CM are given for the number of G-conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups with each
listed socle.

Proof. Let M P S with socpMq P Liepp1q, and let V be the natural module of G. The
possibilities for socpMq are determined in [13], and we list them in Table 7 alongside necessary
conditions.

It remains to justify the bound CM . Consider socpMq “ S “ P SLdpsq, d ě 3. Here
dim V “ n “ sd´1
s´1 ´δ where δ P t0, 1u. By [14, Theorem 1.1], in most cases the representation
of S on V is one of at most s´ 1 Weil representations. The exceptions are when d “ 3, s “ 2
or 4, and in each case it can be veriﬁed that the number of possible representations is again
at most s´ 1 using [7] and [16]. Hence the number of P GLpV q-classes of such subgroups M
is at most s ´ 1. If G “ P SLnpqq, it follows that that number of G-classes of subgroups M
is at most ps ´ 1q|P GLnpqq : P SLnpqq| “ ps ´ 1qeG. If G “ P Ωǫ
npqq, Corollary 2.10.4 of [17]
shows that the number of P GOǫ
npqq-classes of subgroups M is also at most s´ 1, and so the
number of G-classes is at most ps ´ 1q|P GOǫ

npqq| “ ps ´ 1qeG.

npqq : P Ωǫ

The remaining possibilities for socpMq and G are dealt with similarly, using [12], [15],

[5] for socpMq “ P Sp2dpsq, P SUdpsq, P SL2psq respectively.

We denote by cS the number of G-classes of subgroups M P S with order divisible by

Proof. Let M P S with socpMq not an alternating group. If socpMq R Liepp1q, the number c
of GLnpqq-conjugacy classes of such M is given in [13]. By [17, Corollary 2.10.4], the number
of G-classes is therefore bounded above by ceG. If socpMq P Liepp1q, the number of G-classes
of M is bounded above by CM in Proposition 4.2.

Suppose G “ P SLnpqq. In this case c ď 6 by [13], and so the contribution to cS from
M P S , socpMq R Liepp1q is at most 6eG “ 6pn, q ´ 1q. The contribution to cS from M P S
with socpMq P Liepp1q is as follows using Proposition 4.2:

• For socpMq “ P SLdpsq, d ě 3 we have s ď n. For each s there exists at most one d
such that n “ sd´1

is less than řn

• For socpMq “ P Sp2dpsq, d ě 2 we have s ď n and s ‰ 3, and since for each s there

exists at most one d as above, the contribution is less than 4pn ´ 2qeG;

• For socpMq “ P SUdpsq we also have s ď n, and, similar to above, the contribution is
less than řn
• For socpMq “ P SL2psq we have s “ n, n ` 1 or 2n ` 1, contributing eG, 1

5. Involutions in maximal subgroups

F

Let G be a ﬁnite simple classical group with natural module of dimension n deﬁned over
qδ, where δ “ 2 if G is unitary and 1 otherwise. Recall our deﬁnition of r as a primitive
prime divisor of qe´ 1 for e deﬁned in Theorem 2. By Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 we assume
r is well-deﬁned.

In this section we deduce upper bounds for the number of involutions in maximal sub-

groups of G with order divisible by r.

Proposition 5.1. Let M ămax G with r | |M|.

i) If M R S , then i2pMq ď I2pMq, where I2pMq is listed in Table 6;
ii) If M P S and socpMq is not an alternating group then i2pMq ă q2n`4;
iii) If M P S and socpMq “ An1 for some n1 ě 9, then n1 “ n ` 1 or n ` 2 and

i2pMq ă pn ` 2q!.

Proof. We prove this case by case for each Aschbacher class. Subgroups M ămax G with
M R S and r | |M| are listed in Table 6.

First suppose M P C1. Then M is of type Cln´kpqq ˆ Clkpqq for some classical group
Clkpqq of the same type as G and k “ 1 or 2. We can bound the number of involu-
If G “ P Ω`npqq and M is of type O´n´2pqq ˆ
tions in each factor using Proposition 2.5.
O´2 pqq we have i2pMq ď i2pP O´n´2pqqqi2pP O´2 pqqq. By Proposition 2.5, i2pP O´n´2pqqq ď
i2pAutpP Ω´n´2pqqqq ă 2pq`1qq
. Using the fact that O´2 pqq – D2pq`1q gives i2pP O´2 pqqq ď
q ` 1, yielding the result. The other values for I2pMq are calculated in a similar fashion.

Next suppose M P C2, C6 or S . In most cases we bound i2pMq by |M|. For M P S with
socpMq ‰ An1 we have |M| ă q3n by [20, Theorem 4.1]. In fact, using the fact that r | |M|,
by Theorem 4.2 of the same paper we have |M| ă q2n`4 unless G “ P SL11p2q, M “ M24, in
which case i2pM24q “ 43263 ă 224. If socpMq “ An1, n1 ě 9 then by [13] we have n1 “ n ` 1
or n ` 2. Therefore i2pMq ď i2pSn`2q ă pn ` 2q!.

If M P C3 then M is of type Clkpqtq.t for some classical group Clkpqtq. Suppose G “
P SLnpqq and let M be of type GLkpqtq.t. If k ě 2 we have i2pMq ď qt´1
q´1 i2pAutpP SLkpqtqqq,
and applying Proposition 2.5 yields the result. If k “ 1, M is of type GL1pqnq.n where n is
prime, and since we’re assuming n ą 2 (by Lemma 2.1) we have i2pMq “ 0. Other bounds
I2pMq for M P C3 are calculated in a similar fashion.

If M P C8 then except for a few small dimensional cases socpMq is a ﬁnite simple
classical group, and so we can apply Proposition 2.5 to obtain the result. The exceptions
occur when G “ P SL2pqq, P SL3p4q, P SL4p2q and M is of type P Ω´2 pqq, P SU3p2q, P Sp4p2q
respectively. For each exceptional case i2pMq can be computed explicitly, and the bound
I2pMq can be veriﬁed.

6. Proof of Theorem 2 for n suﬃciently large

Let G be a ﬁnite simple classical group, with G “ P SLǫ

npqq pn evenq
or P Ωnpqq pnq oddq. If G “ P Ωǫ
npqq|. Also,
recall that r is a primitive prime divisor of qe ´ 1, where e is deﬁned in Theorem 2, and
assume G is such that r is well-deﬁned. Let x P G be an element of order r.

In this section, except for a small number of possible exceptions (given in Proposition

npqq recall the deﬁnition of aǫ “ |P SOǫ

npqq, P Spnpqq, P Ωǫ
npqq : P Ωǫ

6.5) we prove Theorem 2 holds in the following cases:

P SLnpqq, n ě 9
P Spnpqq, n ě 12
P Ωǫ
npqq pn evenq, n ě 14
P Ωnpqq pnq oddq, n ě 13
P SUnpqq, n ě 8.

We ﬁrst require a result on the number of conjugates of a maximal subgroup containing x.

Lemma 6.1. If x lies in two conjugate maximal subgroups of G, say M and M g for some
g P G, then mg P NGpxxyq for some m P M.
Proof. We ﬁrst note that Sylow r-subgroups of G are cyclic (this follows from [11, Theorem
4.10.2]).

Suppose x P M X M g where M is a maximal subgroup of G and g P G, so x, xg´1

P M.
We have xxy,xxg´1y contained in Sylow r-subgroups of M, conjugate by some m P M. As
the Sylow r-subgroups are cyclic, xxy and xxg´1
y are also conjugate by m. This implies that
mg P NGpxxyq.
Corollary 6.2. If x lies in a maximal subgroup M of G, the number of G-conjugates of M
containing x is |NGpxxyq|
|NMpxxyq|

.

12

, completing the proof.

Proof. Let C “ tM g : g P G, x P M gu. Then NGpxxyq acts on C by conjugation, and Lemma
6.1 implies this action is transitive. The stabilizer of M is NGpxxyq X NGpMq “ NMpxxyq
since M is maximal. Therefore |C| “ |NGpxxyq|
|NMpxxyq|
Lemma 6.3. Let T ď G be a maximal torus containing x. Then CGpxq “ T .
Proof. Let H be a simple algebraic group over Fq such that pH Fq1 “ G for a Steinberg
morphism F . Also let Fˆqe “ xλy. Then x is conjugate in H to diagpλa, λaq, λaq2
, Ikq
where a is such that x has order r and k ď 2, with equality if and only if G “ P Ω`npqq.
We ﬁnd that CHpxq is contained in a unique maximal torus containing x. Therefore, taking
ﬁxed points yields the result.

, . . . , λaqe´1

Proposition 6.4. Let M ămax G with x P M, and assume M R S . Then |NMpxxyq| ě NM ,
where NM is listed in Table 6. The values of |NGpxxyq| are listed in Table 9.
Proof. We ﬁrst consider NGpxxyq. By Lemma 6.3 there is a unique maximal torus T of G
containing x. We have NGpxxyq ď NGpTq by Lemma 6.3, and conversely the normalizer of T
will normalize the unique Sylow r-subgroup of T containing x, yielding NGpxxyq “ NGpTq.
By [25, § 25], T corresponds to an element w in the Weyl group W of G, and Proposition
25.3 in the same section gives |CWpwq| “ |NGpTq : T|. The values of |T| and |NGpTq : T|
can be computed from [6]. Hence |NGpxxyq| as in Table 9.

We now consider NMpxxyq, and proceed case by case for each Aschbacher class of sub-

groups M containing x with r | |M|. Such classes are listed in Table 6.

Consider M P C1 of type Cln´kpqqˆ Clkpqq for some classical group Clmpqq of the same
type as G with k ď 2. Then NMpxxyq is of the form NCln´kpqqpxxyq ˆ Clkpqq. If the maximal
torus in Cln´kpqq containing x is T 1, then, by the same reasoning as for NGpxxyq in ﬁrst
paragraph, the normalizer of x in M is of the form NCln´kpqqpT 1q ˆ Clkpqq, and using [6]
yields the result.

For M P C2 or C6 we use the obvious bound |NMpxxyq| ě r.
Consider M P C3 of the form M0.t where M0 “ Clkpqtq, a classical group of the same
type as G. Then T ď M0, and NM0pxxyq “ NM0pTq as above. It remains to consider M
. By
Lemma 6.3, CGpxq “ T , and so there is a unique Sylow r-subgroup P of M containing x.
Therefore NMpxxyq “ NMpPq. By the Frattini argument, M “ M0NMpPq, and so

Hence NMpxxyq “ NM0pxxyq.t, showing that for M P C3 we have NGpxxyq “ NMpxxyq. For
the remaining cases M P C3 a similar method yields the result.

For M P C8, we use the same method as we did for NGpxxyq in the ﬁrst paragraph to

obtain the lower bound NM .

Let µi be a set of G-conjugacy class representatives of maximal subgroups M P Ci with
order divisible by r, and µ0 be a set of G-conjugacy class representatives for M P S with

The values |µi| and maximal subgroups M contributing to Σi, 1 ď i ď 8 are found in Table 6
by Proposition 4.1. Upper bounds for the number of conjugacy class representatives M P µ0
with socpMq R tAn`1, An`2u are found in Table 8 by Corollary 4.3. For M P µ0 with
socpMq P tAn`1, An`2u, socpMq has a unique irreducible n-dimensional representation over
any ﬁeld (where the characteristic p | n ` 2 in the n ` 2 case), preserving an orthogonal (or

14

symplectic in characteristic 2) form (see [17, § 5]). Hence the number of such representations
is 0 if G “ P SLǫ

npqq, and is at most eG otherwise.
By Proposition 6.4, if M R S then |NGpxxyq|

where NM is found in Table 6
and |NGpxxyq| is found in Table 9. If M P S we use |NMpxxyq| ě r if socpMq R tAn`1, An`2u,

by Proposition 3.1
and Proposition 5.1. This leads to an upper bound for each Σi which can be manipulated

Using (1), (2) it can then be veriﬁed that for n ě 16 and all q, or for n ě 14 and q ě 3, we
have Σ3 ` Σ0 ă 1. For n “ 14, q “ 2, we ﬁnd r “ 43, and so by Table 7 and [13] there are
no subgroups M P S with order divisible by r. Therefore using (1) we ﬁnd Σ3 ă 1, and this
proves the result for G “ P Ω´npqq, n ě 14. Similar arguments deal with all other possibilities
for G.

7. Proof of Theorem 2 for small n

We now consider G with n smaller than in Proposition 6.5.

In view of Lemma 2.1,
Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 6.5, to prove Theorem 2 it suﬃces to prove the following groups
are p2, pq-generated for some p P t3, 5, ru:
P Spnpqq, n “ 8, 10 and pn, qq “ p4, 2aq,p4, 3aq,p12, 2q;
P Ωǫ
P Ωnpqq pq oddq, n “ 9, 11.
Proposition 7.1. If G is a group listed in p:q and M is a maximal subgroup of G with order
divisible by r, then M is conjugate to a group listed in Table 6 (M P Ci) or a group with
socle listed in Table 10 (M P S ). In Table 10, upper bounds CM are given for the number
of G-classes of subgroups M with the given socle.

• Let M P C3 be of the form Clkpqtq.t for a classical group Clkpqtq of the same type as
G. Instead of bounding the number of prime divisors of n (and hence the number of
classes) by dn for some d ď 1, we instead calculate the exact number of prime divisors
and bound the number of involutions contained in each class separately using Table 6.

We can improve the bound on Σ0 more signiﬁcantly: Table 10 lists possible socpMq
for subgroups M contributing to Σ0. If socpMq R tAn`1, An`2u then we bound i2pMq using

17

either |M| or Proposition 2.5 if applicable, rather than q2n`4 from [20]. If socpMq “ An1 for
n1 “ n ` 1 or n ` 2, then i2pMq ď i2pSn1q ď řt n1
We note that for each n it may not be possible to prove Q2pG, xq ă 1 for all q using the
lower bound i2pGq ě I2pGq. However, for speciﬁc q we can prove Q2pG, xq ă 1 by instead
using the lower bound for i2pGq listed in Table 5.

We ﬁrst consider Σ1. Let µ1 be a set of conjugacy class representatives of subgroups

either two representatives of type O11pqq ˆ O1pqq pq oddq or one of type O11pqq pq evenq.
Using Tables 3, 5 and 8 we bound cM |NGpxxyq|

subgroups giving the largest contribution to Σ1 occur when q is odd. This leads to

We now consider Σ0. Let µ0 be a set of conjugacy class representatives for M P S
with r | |M|. By Table 10 there are at most 8 classes with socle P SL2p11q, 8 classes with
socle M12, and 4 classes with socle A13. By Corollary 6.2 and Table 6, for M of the ﬁrst or
second type there are at most 10pq5`1qpq`1q

10pq5`1qpq`1q
of alternating type there are at most

[7] we calculate i2pMq ď 55, 190080, 272415 for socpMq “ P SL2p11q, M12, A13 respectively.

We see that for q ě 3 we have Q2pG, xq ď Σ1 ` Σ2 ` Σ3 ` Σ0 ă 1. It therefore suﬃces
to prove Σ ă 1 for q “ 2. Computing similar bounds for Σi using the lower bound for i2pGq
found in Table 5 instead of I2pGq from Table 4 yields the result.

Calculations for the remaining G are similar.
