Abstract The theory of phenomenological Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics is extended
by includimg stochastic processes in order to account for recently derived thermodynami-
cal relations such as the Jarzynski equality. Four phenomenological axioms are postulated
resulting in a phenomenological interpretation of Jarzynski’s equality. Especially, consid-
ering the class of Jarzynski processes Jarzynski’s equality follows from the axiom that the
statistical average of the exponential work is protocol independent.

Introduction

Among many branches of thermodynamics –such as Thermodynamics of Irreversible Pro-
cesses, Rational Thermodynamics, Extented Thermodynamics, Endoreversible Thermo-
dynamics, Finite Time Thermodynamics, Quantum Thermodynamics, Mesoscopic The-
ory, GENERIC [1]– Stochastic Thermodynamics is another branch which introduces prob-
abilities into the thermodynamical description [2]. But in contrast to the above mentioned
branches, Stochastic Thermodynamics allows processes of negative process entropy, some
times called ”violations” of the Second Law. This item does not have any consequences
on the phenomenological level because the negative process entropies vanish by estab-
lishing mean values using the introduced probabilities. Consequently it is obvious, how
to obtain the phenomenological level in Stochastic Thermodynamics, but how vice-versa
to incorporate stochastic processes with their probabilities and process entropies into
phenomenological Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics is an open question which is investi-
gated in this paper. This is not done in full generality, but only for a special process class
–called the Jarzynski process class– because we want to clarify the status of the integral
ﬂuctuation theorem –the Jarzynski equality [3]– in the framework of Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics.

The paper is organized as follows: After having introduced the Jarzynski process, a sketch
of Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics of discrete systems is given for introducing the items
which later on are needed. The Jarzynski process of phenomenological Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics is replaced by a set of stochastic processes which generate probability
densities deﬁned on the process work as a stochastic variable. These stochastic processes
are decomposed into regular and non-regular processes distinguished by their process en-
tropy production: regular ones have positive process entropy production, whereas that of
the non-regular processes is negative. The mean values of process dissipation and work
are considered with respect to the phenomenological Second Law. Two phenomenological
axioms establish Jarzynski’s equality. The reversible case and equilibrium are shortly
discussed. A summary and a discussion ﬁnish the paper.

2 The Jarzynski Process

We consider a discrete system1 which interacts with its environment by power and heat
exchange performing a Jarzynski process. Such a process begins at time t = 0 in a ﬁxed
equilibrium state Aeq whose work variable (Jarzynski’s switching parameter) is λ = 0 and
arrives at time t = τ in a non-equilibrium state2 C neq with the work variable λ = 1.
During the time 0 ≤ t ≤ τ , the system exchanges irreversibly work and heat with its
controlling equilibrium environment3 of constant thermostatic temperature T ∗. For times
τ < t ≤ d the thermal contact with the controlling heat reservoir maintains, but the
switching parameter is ﬁxed at λ = 1, that means, no additional work, but heat is
exchanged between the system and the reservoir during this time interval. Consequently,
the ﬁnal equilibrium state Beq has the same work variable λ = 1 as C neq, and according
to the process control by the heat reservoir its temperature is T ∗. Because the state
space of the system in consideration is given by the work variable λ and by the contact
temperature Θ 4, we can represent the Jarzynski process as follows

Here, the time-dependent work variable λ(t) –the protocol– is arbitrary, but controlled,

whereas the heat exchange

Q (t) is uncontrolled and depends on the given protocol.

The interpretation of the work which is done during the transfer from λ = 0 to λ = 1
–during the protocol– is diﬀerent in Non-equilibrium and Stochastic Thermodynamics:
in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics the work is a phenomenological variable, whereas in
Stochastic Thermodynamics the work is introduced as a stochastic variable w generating
a propability distribution pλ(w), if identical protocols λ(t) are performed. Considering a

where ∆ABF denotes the diﬀerence of the equilibrium free energy of the system between
the states Aeq and Beq. Note that
(4) remains valid even if we only look at changes
of the system from Aeq to C neq because there is no work performed on the system from
C neq to Beq and pλ(w) remains unchanged during that part. Hence,
(4) teaches that
non-equilibrium stochastic ﬂuctuations contain valuable information about equilibrium
quantities.

Jarzynski’s equality and was originally discovered in 1997 [3, 8]. Since then it was derived
under many circumstances, for instance, it follows from the detailed (Crooks) ﬂuctua-
tion theorem [9, 10, 11], it is also valid in the strong coupling regime [12] or for quan-
tum systems [13, 14, 15]. Furthermore, early experimental conﬁrmations can be found
in [16, 17, 18] and a recent review is given in [19]. In the next section we will look at
the Jarzynski process from a purely phenomenological perspective (without probabilities
and stochasticity) before we then ask how to incorporate the Jarzynski equality on a
phenomenological level ?

3 A Thermodynamical Sketch

3.1 Basic phenomenological variables

The state of a discrete thermodynamical system is described by basic variables. Kind
and number of these variables depend on the nature of the system under consideration
and on the process going on in that system. The number of variables in non-equilibrium
is clearly greater than in equilibrium. Therefore, equilibrium needs a minimal number
of basic variables spanning the so-called equilibrium sub-space. According to a special
formulation of the Zeroth Law [20], the equilibrium variables of a thermally homogeneous5
system are

zeq = (U, a, n)

or

zeq = (T, a, n)

(5)

(internal energy U, work variables a, mol numbers n, thermostatic temperature T). In
equilibrium, there exists an one-to-one mapping between the internal energy of the system
and its thermostatic temperature U ↔ T .

More basic variables than in equilibrium are needed in non-equilibrium

z = (U, a, n, zneq).

(6)

The set of the non-equilibrium variables zneq depends on the nature of the system in
consideration: e.g. the orientation of needle-shaped molecules may be an example in the
case of complex materials, time derivatives of the equilibrium variables and dissipative

5A system without adiabatic partitions.

3

ﬂuxes are other examples. Here with regard to Jarzynski processes, we introduce the
contact temperature Θ of the system as one non-equilibrium variable [5, 6, 7]. Other
basic non-equilibrium variables –e.g. the internal variables– are marked by a place-holder
ξ. Consequently, the non-equilibrium variables are

zneq = (Θ, ξ),

and the basic variables spanning the state space of the system are

z = (U, a, n, Θ, ξ).

(7)

(8)

The non-equilibrium contact temperature Θ is independent of the other variables of the
state space, especially independent of the internal energy [21].

3.2 Non-equilibrium entropy, First Law

A non-equilibrium entropy is a state function on the non-equilibrium state space (8). The
time rate of this non-equilibrium entropy is an analogue to Gibbs’ fundamental equation

6If the contact temperature Θ in (9) is replaced by the thermostatic temperature T ∗ of the controlling

heat reservoir and is therefore not a state variable. In equilibrium, Θ is replaced by the thermostatic
temperature T of the system.

3.3 Contact temperature, free energy and work

We consider a closed non-equilibrium system which is in contact with a heat reservoir of
thermostatic temperature T ∗. The heat exchange between them is
contact temperature Θ of the non-equilibrium system [5, 6] by the inequality

Q. We now deﬁne the

(13)

This “deﬁning inequality of the contact temperature” states that Θ = T ∗ if and only if
˙Q = 0.

an inequality which stems from introducing the contact temperature by (13) and which
is independent of the Second Law. Here, T ∗ is the constant thermostatic temperature of
a controlling heat reservoir, such one which appears in the Jarzynski process.

Next, we deﬁne the state function of non-equilibrium free energy as7

which stems as (14) from the deﬁning inequality of the contact temperature (13). Ac-
cording to the decomposition of the entropy rate (12), the bracket in (19)1 is the entropy
production, so that ΣAB becomes the process entropy production between Aeq and Beq,
and DAB is the process dissipation which is in generally greater than T ∗ΣAB. Note that

7This deﬁnition is in contrast to deﬁnitions used in Stochastic Thermodynamics [24, 25, 26] where the
contact temperature is not used and is replaced by the thermostatic temperature T ∗ of the controlling
reservoir. Thus, F becomes the free energy in the equilibrium state Beq (3), whereas (15) refers to C neq.

8An integration only between Aeq and C neq would not result in (18) because of ΘC 6= T ∗.

DAB/T ∗ is also sometimes called the entropy production because it coincides with the
entropy increase of system and bath [3, 2, 19].

Introducing Stochasticity

In contrast to macroscopic systems, the behaviour of small (mesoscopic) systems is in-
herently stochastic: for describing them, stochastic variables have to be used generating
probability distributions. Although the average behaviour of stochastic systems still obeys
the phenomenological laws of thermodynamics, there is much more to discover as Stochas-
tic Thermodynamics lets suppose. Here, for the special exampe of Jarzynki processes, we
are interested in a “top-down” approach, i.e., we ask how to modify phenomenological
Non-equilibirum Thermodynamics in order to account for ﬂuctuations and stochasticity.
This is in contrast to Stochastic Thermodynamics, which follows rather from a “bottom-
up” approach by relying on microscopically derived equations of motion (e.g., Langevin
or master equations) [2].

4.1 Process work as a stochastic variable

λ

We consider one of the numerous protocols λ(t) performing a Jarzynski process. According
to (20), the work W AB
is required. Whenever the same protocol is used in Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics, the same work is required for performing the corresponding Jarzynski
process. This situation is totally diﬀerent for stochastic systems: several experiments, all
performed with the same given protocol λ(t) require several diﬀerent works for performing
the Jarzynski process with the result, that (20) cannot hold true for stochastic systems.
Consequently, we postulate that the process work is a stochastic quantity.

4.1.1 The ﬁrst basic axiom

The same protocol λ(t) generates by the stochastic properties of the material –introduced
by the stochastic mapping L(λ, Θ) for the generalized forces [27]– diﬀerent process works

λ ) on the
stochastic variable of the process work. Consequently, in the framework of Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics, the probability distribution function pλ(W AB
λ ) is a measurable quantity
which can be found out by performing a suﬃcently high number of Jarzynski processes
always using the same protocol λ(t). Not only the work becomes a stochastic quantity
but also related quantities such as heat, entropy and entropy production.

4.1.2 Jarzynski process class

We can suppose, that by replacing the phenomenological quantities of Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics by stochastic ones, some results of the phenomenological theory will
change: Stochastic and Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics are diﬀerent to each other, and
the following question arises: What are the phenomenological conditions under which Non-
equilibrium Thermodynamics turns out to be a special case of Stochastic Thermodynamics
? For instance, it is easy to see that, taking Jarzynski’s inequality into account, processes
of negative process dissipation appear in Stochastic Thermodynamics, a fact which is
strictly forbidden in Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics.

Up to now, we considered one arbitrary, but ﬁxed protocol belonging to a special Jarzynski
process. According to (1)3 and (2)3, Jarzynski processes can be performed with several
diﬀerent protocols. All these protocols together form the (stochastic) Jarzynski process
class

{Jλ} := n ∧ λ : λ(t) ∈ Jλ, pλ(W AB

λ )o.

(27)

The introduction of this process class allows to derive connections between the probability
densities of diﬀerent protocols in the sequel.

7

4.2 Exponential mean process work

Approaching Jarzynski’s equality, we start out with Jensen’s inequality9

Z p(x) exp(−βx)dx ≥ exp(cid:16) − βZ p(x)xdx(cid:17),

Z p(x)dx = 1,

p(x) ≥ 0,

β > 0,

(28)

(29)

and we identify x with the stochastic process work, and the probability function pλ(x)
belongs to an arbitrary protocol λ(t)

x ≡ W AB

Z pλ(x)xdx =: W AB

λ ≥ exp(cid:16) − βW AB
λ (cid:17).

(31)

As already mentioned, the theoretical concept of process work is diﬀerent in Stochastic
and Non-equilibrium thermodynamics: according to (30), we have to distinguish between
stochastic and phenomenological work: W AB

6= W AB

[27].

Applying the mean value theorem on the lhs of (31), we obtain

(32)

Here, Mλ is the exponential mean process work which is diﬀerent from the phenomenolog-
ical one according to (32)

Mλ ≤ W AB

.

(33)

We now consider the exponential mean process work in two special cases of the probability
distribution: the non-stochastic case and the reversible one.

4.2.1 The non-stochastic case

If in every repetition of the same protocol we measure the same work value W ABnst
refer to this case as “non-stochastic” and the corresponding probability density is

(34)

(35)

(36)

because the phenomenological process work obeys the Second Law (23) also for non-
stochastic processes.

9Jensen’s inequality states that for any convex function f and random variable X we have E[f (X)] ≥

f [E(X)] where E[...] denotes an expectation value. Since f (x) = e−βx is convex, Eq. (28) follows.

8

4.2.2 The reversible case

According to (25)2, the reversible case is deﬁned by

Thus, (32) yields

(39)

Consequently, the exponential mean process work Mλ is process-dependent −reversible
or non-stochastic− for the present10.

4.3 Regular and non-regular processes

The stochastic process work (26) takes values which can be greater or smaller than the
free energy diﬀerence ∆ABF . Consequently, the integral in (32) can be decomposed into
two parts

Zx≥∆

pλ(x) exp(−βx)dx +Zx<∆

pλ(x) exp(−βx)dx = exp(−βMλ).

(40)

We now denote processes with W AB
λ <
∆ABF as non-regular ones. Consequently, the ﬁrst integral of (40) runs over the regular
processes, whereas the second one runs over the non-regular processes.

λ ≥ ∆ABF as regular processes and such with W AB

Application of the mean value theorem to the lhs of (40) is possible and results by use of

5 Jarzynki’s Equality

5.1 Two phenomenological lemmata

Approaching Jarzynski’s equality, an axiom is needed which postulates suitable properties
of the exponential mean process work Mλ which is up to now protocol dependent according
to (39). For more physical elucidation, we formulate this axiom in two steps by two
lemmata, so to say as auxiliary axioms. Although the exponential mean process work Mλ
is smaller than W AB
according to (33), we demand that it satiﬁes the Second Law (23)
like the phenomenological process work:

λ

(cid:4)Lemma I:

(cid:4)

(53)

Lemma I together with the inequalities (33), (43), and (49) can be summarized as

M −

λ

or, equivalently,

exp (−βM −

λ ) > exp (−β∆ABF ) ≥ exp (−βMλ) (cid:26) ≥ exp (−βW AB

λ

λ )

(54)

)

.

(55)

Because Lemma I is demanded for all protocols – also for reversible ones – we obtain from
(39)1 in comparison with (53)

and (38) results in

M ABrev

λ

= ∆ABF,

Z prev

λ (x) exp(−βx)dx = exp(−β∆ABF ).

(56)

(57)

That is to say, Lemma I implies the Jarzynski equality (4) for reversible protocols. Taking
the second inequality of (55) into account, (48) results in

P −

λ ≤

(58)

that means, Lemma I gives also a constraint on the integrated probability P −
non-regular processes, an inequality which we need later on.

λ of the

Now, to extend the validity of the Jarzynski equality to arbitrary protocols we introduce a
second Lemma, which states that the non-regular admixture (48) should have an inﬂuence
as great as possible by choosing Mλ independently of the special protocol. Hence, we
demand

(cid:4)Lemma II:

(cid:4)

(59)

Note that Lemma II implies Lemma I, but we found it intuitive to start with Lemma I
separately. Furthermore, the second inequality of (55) and the inequality (58) change into
equations by Lemma II. Now, multiplication of (32)1 with exp(βMλ) and taking Lemma
II into account results in a phenomenological vindication of Jarzynski’s equality

{Jλ} :

Z pλ(x) exp(cid:16) − β(x − ∆ABF )(cid:17)dx = 1

(60)

Note that the restriction on the probability densities pλ(W AB
λ ) by the phenomenological
Lemmata I and II generating Jarzynski’s equality can be tested by experimental investiga-
tion according to our basic assumption that these probability densities are experimentally
given in the view of Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics. Especially, testing the restrictions
on P ±
λ might require much less statistics than the validation of the Jarzysnki equality itself
for which it is extremely important to sample the very rare events where the dissipated
work is much smaller than the free energy diﬀerence [28, 29].

5.2 The Second Basic Axiom

Because ∆ABF is a constant belonging to all Jarzynski processes between A and B, we
obtain from (60) for two diﬀerent protocols λ(t) and µ(t) of {Jλ}

Z pλ(x) exp(−βx)dx = Z pµ(x) exp(−βx)dx = exp(−β∆ABF ).

(64)

That means, the expectation value of the exponential process work exp(−βW AB
λ ) is
protocol-independent, and all protocols of the Jarzynski process class have to satisfy
Jarzynski’s equality, a fact which restricts the possible probability densities. Consequently,
Jarzynski’s equality is an object of experimentally testing because in Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics we do not start out with special given probability densities pλ(W AB
λ ).

Jarzynski’s equality is here established by the two phenomenological lemmata (53) and
(59), whereby the second one includes the ﬁrst. The two-step procedure is chosen because
of the more evident physical interpretation. The main result of Jarzynski’s equality is
that the mean value of the exponential process work is protocol-independent according to
Lemma II (59)3. This fact can be used for replacing the two phenomenological lemmata
by another basic axiom:

(cid:4)Second Basic Axiom:

the expo-
The mean value of
nential process work is protocol-
independent.

(cid:4)
Using this axiom, (59) follows immediately from (39), because protocol independence of

12

the mean value of the exponential process work means M rev
λ . This more formal
axiom allows to establish Jarzynski’s equality with out use of Lemmata I and II which
can be regarded as physical interpretation behind the Second Basic Axiom.

λ = M nst

Jarzynski’s equality, derived in the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics [3, 2], is
an integral ﬂuctuation relation with regard to the Jarzynski process class. Whatever
its derivation in Stochastic Thermodynamics may be, from the point of view of Non-
equilibrium Thermodynamics, Jarzynski’s equality can be phenomenologically established
by the Second Basic Axiom. The procedure for implementing stochastic processes into
Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics is totally diﬀerent from that used in Stochastic Ther-
modynamics because we neither make use of any underlying equation of motion nor any
speciﬁc Hamiltonian in our framework. In Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics non-regular
processes appear instead of reversed processes with the diﬀerence that non-regular pro-
cesses are measurable contributions to the non-regular admixture. The Second Basic
Axiom which allows to establish Jarzynski’s equality is a phenomenological statement on
the protocol-independence of the mean values of the exponential process works.

6 Some Results

6.1 Dissipation and non-stochasticity

Jarzynski’s equation allows to express the dissipation. Starting out with (60) and (31)

Z pλ(x) exp(−βx)dx = exp(−β∆ABF ) ≥ exp(−βW AB

λ

),

we obtain

Z pλ(x) exp(cid:16) − β(x − W AB

λ

)(cid:17)dx = exp(cid:16) + β(W AB

λ − ∆ABF )(cid:17) ≥ 1,

and the dissipation is

DAB

λ

:= β(W AB

λ − ∆ABF ) = lnZ pλ(x) exp(cid:16) − β(x − W AB

λ

)(cid:17)dx ≥ 0.

(65)

(66)

(67)

The phenomenological process work W AB

λ

is given by (30)2.

A further result due to Jarzynski’s equality is obtained for non-stochastic processes: taking
(59)3 into account, (36) yields

∆ABF = M nst

λ = W ABnst

λ

≥ ∆ABF −→ ∆ABF = W ABnst

λ

,

(68)

that means, non-stochastic processes are always reversible, if Jarzynski’s equality holds:

Jarzynski’s equality −→ (cid:26) non-stochastic −→ reversible

stochastic ←− irreversible

(69)

Because reversible ”processes” are deﬁned as trajectories in the equilibrium sub-space [30,
31, 32], they are idealized objects which do not exist in nature. Nevertheless, the reversible

13

processes have to be included into the theoretical framework because they belong to it as
a closure of the theory. According to (69), all irreversible processes create stochasticity
in the sense that the work distribution is diﬀerent from a delta distribution, but why
was this not recognized so far within the framework of phenomenological Non-equilibrium
Thermodynamics? This is due to the fact that most experiments were carried out on
macroscopic systems where the number of repetitions of the experiment as well as the
measurement device is not sensible enough to discriminate between diﬀerent work values
for a given protocol. Hence, the diﬀerent process works appear as being equal according
to (20) and (26)

JλZ B

A hL(λ, Θ) − L(λ, Θ)i •

λ (t)dt ≈ 0.

(70)

Consequently, conventional Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics is a special case of Stochas-
tic Thermodynamics, if Jarzynski’s equality holds and the stochasticity of the irreversible
processes is ignored. Another possibility to ignore stochasticity is to remove the non-
regular processes from the theoretical concept, discussed in the next section.

6.2 Stochasticity without ”violations” ?

Taking lemma II (59) into account, Jarzynski’s equality writes according to (40)

Zx≥∆

pλ(x) exp(−βx)dx +Zx<∆

pλ(x) exp(−βx)dx = exp(−β∆ABF ).

(71)

Here, the (x ≥ ∆)-terms belong to the regular processes. According to (42)2, the non-
regular admixture includes all experiments belonging to protocols λ(t) whose process work
x is smaller than the diﬀerence ∆ABF of the free energy. These experiments are some
times denoted as ”violations” of the Second Law. This expression should be used with
care because the phenomenological Second Law is not a statement valid for stochastic
variables.

We now investigate the consequences, if the non-regular processes are eliminated and only
the regular processes are considered. Thus, we set

x < ∆ABF :

pλ(x)

.

= 0 −→ Zx≥∆

pλ(x)dx = 1,

(72)

and a naive application of Jarzynski’s equality (71) becomes

Zx≥∆

pλ(x)(cid:16) exp(−βx) − exp(−β∆ABF )(cid:17)dx = 0.

Because the big bracket in (73) is negative, the probability density is

x ≥ ∆ABF :

pλ(x) = δ(x − ∆ABF ),

(73)

(74)

that means: if Jarzynski’s equality holds and if the non-regular admixture vanishes, the
stochastic process works x = W AB
have for all protocols the same value ∆ABF . Conse-
quently, the regular processes are non-stochastic according to (34) and reversible according
to (69). Thus, we proved the following statement:

λ

14

If Jarzynski’s equality holds and the non-regular admix-
ture vanishes, all regular processes are non-stochastic and
reversible.

or shorter in other words: irreversible processes generate stochasticity and no stochasticity
without non-regular processes.

6.3 A special family of probability densities

In principle, there are many diﬀerent probability distributions possible which satisfy the
Jarzynski equality. But of course, these probability distributions are not arbitrary because
they have to satify Jarzynski’s equality as a constraint. We now are going to consider
a special, but characteristic family for which the non-regular processes are much less
frequent than the regular ones. For this pupose we start out with Jarzynski’s equality
(60) written down in the special decomposition into regular and non-regular processes

Zx≥∆

pλ(x) exp(cid:16) − β(x − ∆ABF )(cid:17)dx +Zx<∆

pλ(x) exp(cid:16) − β(x − ∆ABF )(cid:17)dx =

= 1 = Zx≥∆

pλ(x)dx +Zx<∆

pλ(x)dx,

(75)

resulting in

Zx≥∆

pλ(x)h exp(cid:16) − β(x − ∆ABF )(cid:17) − 1idx =

= Zx<∆

pλ(x)h1 − exp(cid:16) − β(x − ∆ABF )(cid:17)idx.

(76)

By changing the integral limits: ﬁrst integral x =: ∆ABF + y, second integral
x =: ∆ABF − y, y ≥ 0

Z ∞

0

pλ(cid:16)∆ABF + y(cid:17)h exp(−βy) − 1idy =

= Z ∞

0

pλ(cid:16)∆ABF − y(cid:17)h1 − exp(βy)idy.

(77)

A special probability density obeying (77) and consequently also satisfying Jarzynski’s
equality is

pλ(cid:16)∆ABF − x(cid:17) =

1 − exp(−βx)
exp(βx) − 1

pλ(cid:16)∆ABF + x(cid:17),

x > 0.

(78)

Because

1 − exp(−βx)
exp(βx) − 1

= exp(−βx),

x > 0,

(79)

we obtain for the probability density (78)

pλ(cid:16)∆ABF − x(cid:17) = exp(−βx)pλ(cid:16)∆ABF + x(cid:17),

x > 0,

(80)

15

showing that the probability density belonging to the non-regular processes is exponen-
tially smaller than that belonging to the regular ones. This special chosen case motivates
to formulate a further axiom in the next section which holds generally for all probability
densities and all protocols of the Jarzynski process class and not only for the special cho-
sen case.

The result (80)is here derived by a phenomenological procedure. As Crooks found out
in Stochastic Thermodynamics [9, 10, 11], the distribution belonging to the non-regular
processes can be linked to the experiment by considering the inverse protocol of λ(t), de-
ﬁned by λ†(t) ≡ λ(τ − t), t ∈ [0, τ ], and the inversion of any magnetic ﬁeld and rotation.
(80) is then known as a special case of the so-called detailed ﬂuctuation theorem [2].

7 The Non-regular Admixture

In the last section, a special class of probability densities was distinguished by an arbitrary
choice which results in the fact that the probability density of the non-regular processes
is smaller than that of the regular processes. This statement has to be generalized for
other process quantities presupposing Jarzynski’s equality.

7.1 The third axiom

Inspired by the last section, we postulate the third axiom:

(cid:4)Third Axiom: For all Jarzynski processes belonging to an arbitrary chosen protocol
λ(t), the fraction of the non-regular processes is not greater than that of the regular ones

P −
λ

•

≤ P +
λ

−→ P −

.

(cid:4)

(81)

This axiom goes beyond the Jarzynski equality or the Crooks ﬂuctuation theorem because
we posutlate it for every protocol of the Jarzynski process class.

A ﬁrst consequence of (81) is according to (52)

W AB

λ − W −

λ ≥ W +

λ − W AB

λ

−→ 2W AB

λ ≥ W +

λ + W −
λ .

(82)

This result (82)1 is pretty clear: the diﬀerence between the phenomenological process
work and the mean value of the process works of the non-regular admixture is not smaller
than that for the regular processes. This statement is so evident that it could serve as
an axiom instead of (81). We now go back to the exponential mean values of the process
work.

Introducing the abbreviations according to (43)3

a := β(M +

λ − ∆ABF ) ≥ 0,

b := β(∆ABF − M −

λ ) ≥ 0,

(83)

we obtain from (63) and (81)1

P −

exp b − 1

an inequality connecting M +

λ , M −

λ and ∆ABF according to the third axiom. Because of

(84) results in

2 − exp(−a) ≤ exp a

ln(cid:16)2 − exp(−a)(cid:17) = bmin(a) ≤ a.

(85)

(86)

Consequently, if a is given, two kinds of b (b− and b+) are possible satisfying (84) in
accordance with the third axiom (81)1

bmin(a) ≤ b− ≤ a ≤ b+.

(87)

Inserting the abbreviations (83), we obtain inequalities which have M +
to satisfy so that the third axiom (81)1 is true

λ , M −

λ and ∆ABF

ln(cid:16)2 − exp(cid:16) − β(M +

λ − ∆ABF ) ≤ β(∆ABF − M −

β(M +

In any case, the third axiom enforces

λ − ∆ABF )(cid:17)i ≤ β(∆ABF − M −

(88)

(89)

an inequality which can be tested by experiments.

The third axiom allows an estimation of the non-regular admixture. Starting out with
(84)1, a y exists

We now investigate the consequences of the third axiom (81) for equilibrium and in the
case of reversible protocols.

7.2 Equilibrium: the fourth axiom

Equilibrium and reversible processes are two diﬀerent concepts which should be distin-
guished properly: whereas reversible ”processes” as trajectories in the equilibrium sub-
space [31] are deﬁned by (37), equilibrium is deﬁned by equilibrium conditions which by
deﬁnition are also valid for reversible processes. In more detail: taking into account that
(52) is also valid for reversible processes, we obtain by use of (37)

.

(98)

We now have to postulate the equilibrium condition in agreement with the deﬁnition of
reversible processes:

(cid:4)Fourth Axiom (Equilibrium): In equilibrium –and consequently also for reversible
processes– regular and non-regular processes are equally frequent11: according to (98), we
obtain

∆ABF − W −

λrev + W −

(99)

The fourth axiom (99)1 points out that in equilibrium the regular processes are equalized
by the non-regular ones. This corresponds to the assumption in Stochastic Thermody-
namics that in equilibrium the global detailed balance is satisﬁed and that probability
ﬂuxes are balanced and no net currents appear. Here, the non-regular processes come
into consideration by splitting the process integrals according to (40) and (42).

According to the fourth axiom (99)1 and (84), we obtain by taking (83) and (86) into
account

lnh2 − exp(−arev)i = brev ≤ arev,
λrev − ∆ABF )(cid:17)i = β(∆ABF − M −

11In Stochastic Thermodynamics, this axiom runs: Forward and backward path probabilities are equal

18

and from (99)3 and (102) follows

2∆ABF = W +

λrev + W −

λrev ≤ M +

λrev + M −

The fourth axiom (99)1 enforces the equality in (89)

lnh2 − exp(cid:16) − β(M +

λrev − ∆ABF )(cid:17)i = β(∆ABF − M −

λrev)

(103)

(104)

which also can be experimentally tested, if the corresponding protocol is reversible, that
means, if the protocol of the Jarzynski process (1) to (3) is suﬃently slow λ(αt), α → 0,
for approximating reversibility.

8 Summary

• Processes of a closed discrete system between to ﬁxed equilibrium states controlled
by a heat reservoir and divided into two parts –the ﬁrst part with power exchange
caused by ﬁxed initial and ﬁxed ﬁnal work variables, the second one as relaxation
by constant work variables to the ﬁnal equilibrium state– constitute the Jarzynski
process class (1) to (3) and (27).

• Experimental fact is that the process work is diﬀerent for several identical Jarzynski
processes enforcing to treat the process work as a stochastic variable whose diﬀerent
values establish the domain of a probability density (26).

• The processes of the Jarzynski process class fall into two branches: regular processes
of non-negative process dissipation (42)1 and non-regular processes of negative pro-
cess dissipation (42)2.

• Although the process dissipation is negative for non-regular processes, the mean
value of all Jarzynski processes –the phenomenological dissipation– is not negative
(22)2.

• Two phenomenological lemmata

I) the exponential mean process work obeys the Second Law and
II) the non-regular processes have an extent as great as lemma I) allows,
are the phenomenological back-ground of the basic axiom

The mean value of the exponential process
work is independent of the Jarzynski process
class.

This basic axiom implements Jarzynski’s inequality straightforward, (59) and (60).

• If Jarzynski’s equality holds, non-stochastic processes are always reversible.

• If Jarzynski’s equality holds, irreversible processes generate stochasticity.

• Beyond Jarzynski’s equality: the extent of the non-regular processes is not greater

than that of the regular ones (81)1.

19

• Beyond Jarzynski’s equality: in equilibrium –and consequently for reversible ”processes”–

the fractions of non-regular and regular processes are equal, (99)1.

9 Discussion

The tools of Stochastic Thermodynamics are based on Statistical Mechanics, whereas
Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics is a purely phenomenological theory. Both theories
describe phenomenological processes, Stochastic Thermodynamics by mean values over
its statistical back-ground and Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics by phenomenological
Laws. For a special class of processes –the Jarzynski process class– an equality, called
Jarzynski’s equality, was derived in 1997 by a statistical procedure containing a proba-
bility density stemming from the statistical back-ground. Now the question arises: can
Jarzynski’s equality be derived phenomenologically, if Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics
is equipped with stochastic processes ?

Considering the Jarzynski process class, an experimental fact is that the process work
is a stochastic variable, that means, performing a Jarzynski process identically repeated,
the process work ﬂuctuates, and a probability density is experimentally generated. What
are now the phenomenological axioms which this probability density has to obey, so that
Jarzynski’s equality is valid ? The answer –based on two phenomenological axioms– is
easy: the mean value of the stochastic exponential process work is the same for all Jarzyn-
ski processes.

The Jarzynski processes which are identically repeated can be split into regular and non-
regular ones. By deﬁnition, the process dissipation of the non-regular processes is smaller
than the corresponding diﬀerence of the free energy. By contrast, the process dissipation
of the regular processes is not smaller than the free energy diﬀerence as it is valid for
all non-stochastic processes. The non-regular processes are sometimes confusingly called
“violations” of the second law of thermodynamics.

Finally statement: Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics of the Jarzynski process class can be
extended by stochastic processes satisfying Jarzynski’s equality which obeys phenomeno-
logical axioms.
