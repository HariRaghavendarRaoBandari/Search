We examine the experimental and theoretical electron-energy loss spectra in 2H-Cu0.2NbS2 and
ﬁnd that the 1 eV plasmon in this material does not exhibit the regular positive quadratic plasmon
dispersion that would be expected for a normal broad-parabolic-band system. Instead we ﬁnd a
nearly non-dispersing plasmon in the momentum-transfer range q < 0.35 ˚A−1. We argue that for
a stoichiometric pure 2H-NbS2 the dispersion relation is expected to have a negative slope as is
the case for other transition-metal dichalcogenides. The presence of Cu impurities, required to
stabilize the crystal growth, tends to shift the negative plasmon dispersion into a positive one, but
the doping level in the current system is small enough to result in a nearly-non-dispersing plasmon.
We conclude that a negative-slope plasmon dispersion is not connected with the existence of a
charge-density-wave order in transition metal dichalcogenides.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The charge density wave (CDW) is a broken symme-
try state of metals induced by electron-phonon or by
electron-electron interactions. The ground state is the
coherent superposition of electron-hole pairs, and, as the
name implies, the corresponding charge density is not
uniform but displays a periodic spatial variation. Usu-
ally, the CDW phase transition is accompanied by the ap-
pearance of an energy gap or pseudo gap in the electronic
band structure, phonon softening and lattice distortions.
Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD)1 are
prototypical materials displaying CDW instability and
for this reason they have attracted considerable interest
in the last years2. However, although extensively stud-
ied, a clear understanding of the physical mechanism re-
sponsible for the appearance of CDW order in this class
of materials is still missing3.
In particular, several ex-
planations have been put forward:
from Fermi surface
nestings4 to van Hove singularities (saddle points) in
the density of states (DOS)5, until a recent theoretical
work that pointed to the role of electron-phonon cou-
pling, ruling out a pure electronic mechanism for the
CDW instability6.

In general, since a generic electronic instability induces
a strong enhancement of the charge-charge response func-
tion, this quantity plays a crucial role in detecting CDW

order not only from a theoretical point of view but also
experimentally. As a matter of fact, being related to the
inverse macroscopic dielectric function, it can be directly
measured in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
and in inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) experiments.

In this context, J. van Wezel and coworkers7 have es-
tablished a direct link between CDW instability and col-
lective excitations (plasmons) that represent the poles
of the charge-charge response function. EELS measure-
ments in three prototypical TMDs belonging to the 2H
family (2H-TaS2, 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-NbSe2)7–9 revealed
a dispersion relation that had a negative slope, i.e., the
plasmon energy was found to decrease with an increasing
momentum transfer. In this case the dispersion is said to
be negative. This is in contrast with the case of a homo-
geneous electron gas (the jellium model), where the plas-
mon has a positive parabolic dispersion. On the basis of
a macroscopic semiclassical Ginzburg-Landau model, it
was suggested that the negative dispersion in TMD is the
consequence of the collective charge ﬂuctuations associ-
ated with the CDW order identifying a direct connection
between CDW instability and plasmon dispersion.7 This
picture was supported by the fact that for 2H-NbS2, the
only system belonging to the 2H family that does not
display CDW order, the available experimental results
pointed out that the plasmon dispersion had a positive
slope10.

Nevertheless, a negative plasmon dispersion has been
found also in several other materials that do not display
CDW instability, for example doped molecular crystals11.
Even alkali metals13–20 have been shown to exhibit sev-
eral deviations from the jellium model including negative
plasmon dispersion. Starting from this observation, a dif-
ferent interpretation of the negative plasmon dispersion
in 2H-TMDs has been given on the basis of ﬁrst princi-
ple calculations21–23. As shown in Ref. 22, the unusual
dispersion in this class of materials is due to the pecu-
liar behavior of intraband transitions that contribute to
the plasmon excitation. If the negative plasmon disper-
sion is a pure band eﬀect, a similar behaviour should
also be present in NbS2 contrary to the experimental
observation10. However, it is important to note that sto-
ichiometric pure NbS2 is diﬃcult to grow since 2H-NbS2
is unstable in the growth process8 unless metallic impu-
rities are present. A possible positive dispersion could
be an eﬀect of impurities that are required to stabilize
the system. Such an eﬀect of metal impurities on the
intraband plasmons in TMDs was shown by utilizing the
rigid-band model and time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT)22. Good agreement between TDDFT
calculations and IXS spectra at high energy and large
momentum transfer was indeed recently found for NbSe2
and Cu0.2NbS2

24.

Motivated by these observations, we combined EELS
experiments and ﬁrst-principle TDDFT calculations, and
investigated the collective excitations and their disper-
sion as a function of the momentum transfer in 2H-
Cu0.2NbS2 with the aim to clarify the origin of the neg-
ative plasmon dispersion in TMDs. From our measure-
ments we did not ﬁnd a positive quadratic dispersion in
this system, in contradiction to what has been reported
before. Earlier TDDFT-based work22 predicted that the
dispersion would be in fact negative if the concentration
of Cu would be small enough. Based on our new ex-
perimental ﬁndings, that match well the prediction of
TDDFT, we argue that the negative plasmon dispersion
is a general property of 2H-TMDs related to the partic-
ular band structure of these materials and that there is
no need to invoke a coupling with the CDW.

II. METHODS

A. Experiment

The Cu0.2NbS2 crystal was grown by vapor transport
using iodine as a transport agent.12 The stoichiometry
was veriﬁed by standardless energy dispersive spectrom-
etry using a Jeol JXA-8600 electron probe microanalyzer.
The EELS measurements along ΓM crystallographic di-
rection (q || [100]) were performed with a 172-keV spec-
trometer described in Refs. 30 and 31. The momentum
resolution was set to 0.04 ˚A−1 and the energy resolution
to 85 meV. The sample temperature was controlled us-
ing a He ﬂow cryostat, and measurements were done at

2

T = 20 K and at room temperature. No particular dif-
ference between the results at diﬀerent temperatures was
found, except for a blueshift of the plasmon energy by
∼0.04 eV upon cooling to 20 K. In the following, we con-
centrate on the data taken at 20 K. The electron beam
spot size on the sample was ∼0.5 mm. The quasielastic
zero-loss peak line’s tail was subtracted from the mea-
sured spectra by ﬁtting a suitable Pearson VII function
to the data for energy transfer (ω) between 0.1 and 0.3
eV.

The crystal used in the experiment was found to have
a well deﬁned stoichiometry of CuxNbS2, with energy-
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy revealing x =0.17–0.18
(hence for the remaining of the article we indicate here
the value x ≈ 0.2). The high quality of the crystal was
veriﬁed by measuring the electron diﬀraction pattern.

B. Computational details

The microscopic complex dielectric function ǫ = ǫ1+iǫ2
is related to the susceptibility χ (Ref. 25) by the rela-
tion: ǫ−1 = 1 + vχ (v being the Coulomb potential).
In TDDFT χ is the solution of the Dyson like equation:
χ = χ0 + χ0(v + fxc)χ, where χ0 is the Kohn-Sham (KS)
susceptibility expressed in terms of KS eigenenergies and
eigenfunctions, while fxc is the exchange-correlation ker-
nel, for which we use the random phase approximation
(RPA) (fxc = 0). The Fourier components of both χ and
ǫ are matrices in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors
G. The macroscopic dielectric function ǫM is given by
ǫM (q, ω) = 1/ǫ−1
GG(q, ω), where q is inside the ﬁrst Bril-
louin zone. The loss function L(q, ω) measured in EELS
experiments is directly related to the imaginary part of
the inverse macroscopic dielectric function through the
following equation: L(q, ω) = −Im ǫ−1

M (q, ω).

In the present work the KS eigenenergies and eigen-
functions used to determine χ0 have been evaluated
in the local-density approximation (LDA) implemented
in a plane-wave-based code26.
In our calculations
we adopt the experimental lattice parameters27. We
use Troullier-Martins and Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter
norm-conserving pseudopotentials28 (with an energy cut-
oﬀ of 120 Ry). In the calculation of χ0 (Ref. 29), we used
a 24 × 24 × 12 grid of k points and included 100 bands.
The macroscopic dielectric function has been obtained
inverting a matrix of 300 G vectors (those parameters
lead to converged results for the response function in the
range of energies and momentum studied in the present
work). Finally, the electron doping induced in NbS2 by
the Cu atoms has been simulated by shifting the Fermi
level upward according to the rigid-band model.

transfers along the ΓM direction. In both cases, the loss
spectrum is characterized by a peak that resides at ∼1
eV, decreasing in intensity and broadening when the mo-
mentum transfer is increased. The dispersion of its en-
ergy as a function of momentum transfer is nearly negli-
gible when q < 0.35 ˚A−1. The results of the experiment
and theory are in excellent agreement. Interestingly, the
dispersion seems to show a somewhat anomalous behav-
ior for q > 0.35 ˚A−1. From the experimental spectra one
might conclude that the plasmon energy starts to shift
to smaller values with increasing q above q > 0.35 ˚A−1.
The reason for this becomes apparent when the theoreti-
cal spectra are carefully examined. At q = 0.352 ˚A−1, the
theoretical loss function peak position increases rapidly
with an increasing q, with a lower-energy peak appear-
ing at ∼0.8–0.9 eV. This lower-energy peak steals most
of the spectral weight at the highest studied q. The ex-
perimental spectra show the same overall behavior, while
due to the generally broader features the two structures
are not individually resolved. However, comparison with
the theoretical spectra reveals uniquely the reason for the
seemingly negative plasmon behavior in this momentum-
transfer range.

To gain further insight into the behaviour of the plas-
mon in this range of momentum transfer, we compare in
Fig. 2 the loss function with the real (ǫ1) and imaginary
(ǫ2) parts of the dielectric function evaluated between
0.22 and 0.4 ˚A−1. As we can see, for a small q, the 1-eV
plasmon is caused by ǫ1 crossing zero. This behavior has
been shown previously to correspond to intraband transi-
tions for bands that cross the Fermi energy11. However,
at q = 0.31 ˚A−1 a shoulder appears in ǫ2 just above
the main intraband peak. Because ǫ1 and ǫ2 are related
through the causality relation, this shoulder causes an os-
cillation in the real part of the dielectric function. This,
in turn, increases the number of zero crossings of the real

part. This explains the appearance of a double structure
in the loss function as seen in Fig. 1. Thus, beyond q
= 0.35–0.4 ˚A−1 it is not possible to clearly identify the
position of the plasmon frequency since in this range of
momentum transfer the loss function obtains a relatively
complex multiple-peak structure. At larger q the oscilla-
tion in ǫ1 disappears. However, for q > 0.40 ˚A−1 the real
part of the dielectric function does no longer cross zero.
This means the plasmon is no longer well deﬁned since
it decays into electron-hole excitations, and the e-h con-
tinuum is probed. It is noteworthy that even at smaller
momentum transfers the plasmon is strongly damped.

The extraction of the dispersion from the plasmon is,
based on the discussion above, a convoluted problem ow-
ing to the peculiar behavior of the dielectric function
and the appearance of the doublet feature. We neverthe-
less present here the apparent energy of the loss-function
peak as a function of q, of both experimental and the-
oretical spectra. This dispersion is shown in Fig. 3, for
plasmon energies renormalized to values extrapolated to
q = 0, i.e., ωpl(q)/ωpl(0), which from the various sources
is ωpl(0) ≈ 0.95 eV (Ref. 10), ≈ 0.98 eV (current exper-
iment), and ≈ 1.09 eV (current theory). From Fig. 3 it
can be seen that while the published results from Ref. 10
show a positive, close to quadratic, upward slope of the
plasmon energy versus q as expected for a plasmon in ho-
mogeneous electron gas, our experiment and theory show
much weaker dispersion until q = 0.3 ˚A−1, after which
the dispersion becomes negative, owing to the reasons
explained above.

It was shown by some of us22 that 2H-TMDs in gen-
eral are expected to exhibit negative plasmon dispersions
for pure stoichiometric systems, but metallic dopants are
expected to aﬀect the dispersion curve, switching it to a
positive dispersing one. This is in agreement with previ-
ous experiments on 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-K0.64TaSe2 (Ref.

In our case, it can be deduced that in Cu0.2NbS2
the level of Cu-doping is enough to ﬂatten the dispersion
curve, but not high enough to switch it into a monoton-
ically increasing one.

The diﬀerence between our new results and than those
obtained in Ref. 10 should be attributed to the presence
of impurities in the samples of both studies. However, in
our case it can be argued that the low density of Cu impu-
rities is not enough to fully switch the plasmon dispersion
into a quadratic one. This result is expected based on the
prediction of modeling the doping by a rigid-band shift
as was done in Ref. 22.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that in 2H-Cu0.2NbS2 the plasmon dis-
persion curve is relatively ﬂat instead of a positive dis-
persion observed in a previous study. We have compared
the experimental loss function of 2H-Cu0.2NbS2 to one
calculated within the TDDFT, which we in turn analyze
in detail by breaking it up into the real and imaginary
part of the dielectric function. Together with comparison
to earlier literature on other TMDs of the 2H family, we
generalize that the negative plasmon dispersion is an in-
trinsic property of the layered 2H-TMD systems. Since it
is exhibited by both kinds of systems: those that exhibit
a CDW order, and those that do not, it should not be at-
tributed directly to a possible interplay of the electronic
excitations and CDW ordering. An inclusion of metal-
lic dopants, required to stabilize NbS2 upon growth, will
aﬀect the dispersion curve, having a tendency to switch
it to a monotonically increasing one. However, we have
shown that in 2H-Cu0.2NbS2 this level is not enough to
switch this behavior.
