TWO ARITHMETIC RELATIONS OF A SUBSPACE OF P n(K)

AND A SUBGROUP OF Aut(K)

JUN-ICHI MATSUSHITA

Abstract. Let K be a commutative ﬁeld and let V be a subspace of P n(K).
Let Γ be a subgroup of Aut(K) and deﬁne the action of Γ on P n(K) by letting
σ((xi)06i6n ) be (σ(xi))06i6n for σ ∈ Γ, (xi)06i6n ∈ P n(K). In this paper,
using two arithmetic notions deﬁned in terms of the Pl¨ucker coordinates of V
and the invariant ﬁeld of Γ, we answer the questions: By what number is the
dimension of the join (resp. meet) of σ(V ) (σ ∈ Γ) greater (resp.
less) than
the dimension of V ?

1. Introduction

Let K be a commutative ﬁeld and let V be a subspace of P n(K), the projective
n-space over K. Let Γ be a subgroup of Aut(K), the automorphism group of K,
and deﬁne the action of Γ on P n(K) by

(1)

σ((xi)06i6n) = (σ(xi))06i6n

for σ ∈ Γ, (xi)06i6n ∈ P n(K). Then, since σ(V ) (σ ∈ Γ) are subspaces of P n(K)
such that dimK σ(V ) (σ ∈ Γ) are equal to dimK V , it is possible and natural to ask
the questions:

(i) By what number is dimK _σ∈Γ
(ii) By what number is dimK \σ∈Γ

σ(V ) greater than dimK V ?,

σ(V ) less than dimK V ?,

whereW andT denote, respectively, the join and the meet of subspaces of P n(K).

In this paper, we answer these questions in terms of the Pl¨ucker coordinates of V
and the invariant ﬁeld of Γ. Let k be the invariant ﬁeld of Γ. For each m-dimensional
subspace X of P n(K), let (. . . , Xi0···im , . . .) denote the Pl¨ucker coordinates of X
and deﬁne the k-irrationality degree Irrk and the k-irrationality codegree Irr∗
k of X
by taking a permutation j0 · · · jn of 0 · · · n such that Xj0···jm 6= 0 and letting

in K n−m. Then we can prove that Irrk and Irr∗
subspace X of P n(K), Irrk X and Irr∗
and Irrk V and Irr∗
the following holds.

k are well-deﬁned (that is, for every
k X are independent of the choice of j0 · · · jn)
k V are answers to the questions (i) and (ii), respectively, that is,

Theorem. We have

dimK _σ∈Γ
dimK \σ∈Γ

σ(V ) = dimK V + Irrk V ,

σ(V ) = dimK V − Irr∗

In the following sections, we actually prove that Irrk is well-deﬁned and (5) holds

and that Irr∗

k is well-deﬁned and (6) holds.

2. Duality of (5) and (6)

For each subspace X of P n(K), let X ∗ denote the dual of X, that is, the set of

(xi)06i6n ∈ P n(K) satisfying

Then, since the join of subspaces of P n(K) is the dual of the meet of their duals,
we have

aixi = 0.

aiσ−1(xi) = 0)
=((xi)06i6n ∈ P n(K) : ∀(ai)06i6n ∈ V
nXi=0

which is equivalent to

(7)

because every σ ∈ Γ satisﬁes

= σ(V ∗).

Also we have

Proposition 1. For each m-dimensional subspace X of P n(K), for each permu-
tation j0 · · · jn of 0 · · · n such that Xj0 ···jm 6= 0, the right-hand side of (2) is equal
to the expression obtained by replacing X, j0 · · · jm, jm+1 · · · jn, and n − m in the
right-hand side of (3) by X ∗, jm+1 · · · jn, j0 · · · jm, and n − (n − m − 1) = m + 1,

Proof. By the well-known relation between the Pl¨ucker coordinates and the dual
Pl¨ucker coordinates of a subspace of P n(K) [3, Chapter VII, § 3, Theorem I], letting

we have

that is, the set of additive inverses of elements of (9). Since a subset of K m+1 and
the set of additive inverses of elements of it linearly span over k the same space,
this implies

which implies that the right-hand side of (2) is equal to (8).

that is, the equality obtained by replacing V in (6) by V ∗. Therefore, for proving
that Irrk is well-deﬁned and (5) holds and that Irr∗
k is well-deﬁned and (6) holds,
it suﬃces to prove either of these, say, the latter, which we prove in the following
section.

3. Proof of (6)

In the present section, P n(k) denotes the image of kn+1 − {0} by the canonical
surjection K n+1 − {0} → P n(K), and a subspace of P n(K) (resp. K n+1) is said
to be k-rational iﬀ it is (or, equivalently, its dual is) spanned by a subset of P n(k)
(resp. kn+1). Deﬁne the action of Γ on K n+1 by (1) for σ ∈ Γ, (xi)06i6n ∈ K n+1.
Then, as can be seen, for example, from [1, Chapter II, § 8, no. 7, Theorem 1 (i)]
(or, more directly, from [2, Chapter V, § 10, no. 4, Proposition 6 a)]) applied to
the vector K-space K n+1 with the k-structure kn+1, we have that

a subspace of K n+1 is k-rational iﬀ it is stable under the action of Γ on K n+1,

which is easily seen to imply that

a subspace of P n(K) is k-rational iﬀ it is stable under the action of Γ on P n(K),

which implies that

(11)

because every τ ∈ Γ satisﬁes τ Γ = Γ and hence

σ(V ) is k-rational

\σ∈Γ
τ (σ(V )) = \σ∈Γ

τ σ(V ) = \σ∈τ Γ

σ(V ) = \σ∈Γ

σ(V ).

τ \σ∈Γ

σ(V )! = \σ∈Γ

For each subspace X of P n(K), let eX denote the span of X ∩ P n(k) in P n(K),

which is the largest k-rational subspace of P n(K) contained in X. Then, since
a k-rational subspace of P n(K) is itself the largest k-rational subspace of P n(K)
contained in it, (11) implies

\σ∈Γ

which is equivalent to

(12)

because we have

 \σ∈Γ

σ(V )! ∩ P n(k) = \σ∈Γ
= \σ∈Γ

σ(V ) =

σ(V ),

^\σ∈Γ
\σ∈Γ
σ(V ) = eV
(σ(V ) ∩ P n(k)) = \σ∈Γ

σ (V ∩ P n(k)) = V ∩ P n(k)

(σ(V ) ∩ σ (P n(k)))

and hence

Also we have

^\σ∈Γ
σ(V ) = eV .

Proposition 2. For each m-dimensional subspace X of P n(K), for each permu-
tation j0 · · · jn of 0 · · · n such that Xj0 ···jm 6= 0, the right-hand side of (3) is equal

to m − dimK eX.
Proof. Let X ′ (resp. eX ′) denote the subspace of K n+1 such that X (resp. eX) is the
image of X ′−{0} (resp. eX ′−{0}) by the canonical surjection K n+1−{0} → P n(K).
Then eX ′ is the span of X ′ ∩ kn+1 in K n+1, and hence satisﬁes
dimk(cid:0)X ′ ∩ kn+1(cid:1) = dimK eX ′ = dimK eX + 1.

for (xi)06i6n ∈ K n+1 to be in X ′, we have

Ker µ = X ′ ∩ kn+1

to m − dimK eX.

(17)

and hence (15). Therefore we have (16), that is, the right-hand side of (3) is equal
(cid:3)

Proposition 2 implies that Irr∗

Remark 1. Let V denote the meet of all k-rational hyperplanes containing V , whose

dual is the join of all k-rational points contained in V ∗, that is, fV ∗. Then we have,

dually to (12) (resp. (17)),

σ(V ) = V (resp. (b) dimK V = dimK V + Irrk V )

because (7) (resp. (10)) implies that (a) (resp. (b)) is equivalent to

σ(V ∗)!∗

(a) _σ∈Γ

\σ∈Γ
σ(V ∗) = fV ∗ (resp. dimK fV ∗ = dimK V ∗ − Irr∗

k V ∗),

k V ∗),

which is equivalent to

that is, the equality obtained by replacing V in (12) (resp. (17)) by V ∗. (a) and
(b) imply (5), just as (12) and (17) imply (6).

Remark 2. In fact, the argument in the because-clause in the third sentence of this
section, which depends on the assumption that Γ is a subgroup of Aut(K), can be
replaced by “every τ ∈ Γ satisﬁes τ Γ ⊂ Γ and hence

τ \σ∈Γ

σ(V )! = \σ∈Γ

and satisﬁes

τ (σ(V )) = \σ∈Γ

τ σ(V ) = \σ∈τ Γ

σ(V ) ⊃ \σ∈Γ

σ(V ),

dimK τ (X) = dimK X

for every subspace X of P n(K) and hence, in particular, for

and therefore satisﬁes

σ(V ),

X = \σ∈Γ
σ(V )! = \σ∈Γ

τ \σ∈Γ

σ(V )”,

which and all other arguments in Section 2 and this section are valid even under
the weaker assumption that Γ is a subsemigroup of Aut(K). Therefore we have
that Irrk is well-deﬁned and (5) holds and that Irr∗
k is well-deﬁned and (6) holds
under this weaker assumption, which coincides with the original assumption when
Γ is ﬁnite.
