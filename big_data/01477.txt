The formation of coherent structures in noise
driven phenomena and in Turbulence is a com-
plex and fundamental question [1]. A particu-
lary important structure is the so-called Rogue
Wave (RW) that arises as the sudden appearance
of a localized and giant peak [2–4]. First stud-
ied in Oceanography, RWs have been extensively
investigated in Optics since 2007 [5], in partic-
ular in optical ﬁbers experiments on supercon-
tinua [5–7] and optical turbulence [4, 8]. How-
ever the typical timescales underlying the ran-
dom dynamics in those experiments prevented
–up to now– the direct observation of isolated
RWs. Here we report on the direct observa-
tion of RWs, using an ultrafast acquisition system
equivalent to microscope in the time domain [9–
12]. The RWs are generated by nonlinear prop-
agation of random waves inside an optical ﬁber,
and recorded with ∼ 250 fs resolution. Our ex-
periments demonstrate the central role played by
“breathers-like” solutions of the one-dimensional
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (1D-NLSE) in the
formation of RWs [13].

Common oceans waves are weakly nonlinear random
objects having nearly Gaussian statistics, while at the
same time, RWs are waves of extremely large amplitude
that occur more frequently than expected from the nor-
mal law [2–4]. The mechanisms underlying the genera-
tion of coherent structures such as RWs from the nonlin-
ear propagation of random waves i.e., in turbulent ﬂows,
is a subject of very active debates and still represents an
open question [8, 14–16].

From the theoretical point of view, the so-called focus-
ing 1D-NLSE (see Eq. 1), which is a generic equation
having an ubiquitous importance in Physics, plays a cen-
tral role in this debate [2, 4, 17, 18]. In particular, the
1D-NLSE describes at leading order the physics of deep-
water wave trains and nonlinear propagation in optical
ﬁbers [19]. The breather-like solutions of the 1D-NLSE,
also called solitons on ﬁnite background, are now consid-
ered as being prototypes of RWs [13, 17, 20–22].

Despite the numerous experimental works devoted to
optical RWs, [4–8, 18, 23] the direct observation of these
coherent structures in the time domain has never been
reported in the context of the nonlinear propagation of
random waves. Randomness of the initial condition is

it has been pointed out in the supercontinuum driven by
noise [5–7, 18] or in optical turbulence [4, 8, 18, 24]

less)

Contrary to the experiments performed in the spatial
domain [25, 26], the fast time scales of ﬂuctuations
(picoseconds or
involved in single-mode ﬁber
experiments makes single-shot recording of RWs a
particularly challenging task.
Pioneer works hence
naturally provided indirect evidences of RWs, using e.g.
spectral ﬁltering [5–7] or statistical measurement from
optical sampling techniques [8].

In this Letter, we present direct single-shot recordings
of optical RWs by using a specially-designed Time
Microscope (TM) ultrafast acquisition system [9, 10, 12].
The temporal resolution of ∼250 fs of our TM (see
Methods and supplementary material) allows us to
investigate the fast dynamics arising from the nonlinear
propagation of random waves in an optical ﬁber (upper
part of Fig. 1). Observations performed with the TM
at the output of the ﬁber immediately reveals the
emergence of
intense peaks, with powers frequently
exceeding the average power (cid:104)P(cid:105) by factors of 10-50 [see
Fig 1(b-d) and supplementary movie 1]. Starting from
random ﬂuctuations having typical time scale around
5 − 10ps [Fig 1(a)], those extreme peaks are also found
to be extremely narrow, with time scales of the order
of several hundreds of femtoseconds [Fig 1(b-d) and
Fig 3(b-d)].

More precisely, the random waves used as initial con-
ditions in our experiments are partially coherent light
waves emitted by a high power Ampliﬁed Spontaneous
Emission (ASE) light source at a wavelength λ ∼ 1560
nm (see Fig. 1). Using a programmable optical ﬁlter,
the optical spectrum of the partially coherent light is
precisely designed to assume a Gaussian shape having
a full width at half maximum that is adjusted either to
∆ν =0.1THz or ∆ν =0.05THz. The partially coherent
waves are launched into a 500 m-long single mode polar-
ization maintaining ﬁber at a wavelength falling into the
anomalous (focusing) regime of dispersion. The light at
the output of the nonlinear ﬁber is then directed to the
TM (detailed in Figure 2), which acquires traces (optical
power versus time over a ≈ 20 ps-long window) at a rate
of 500 per second, and displays the signals in real time.
As in a standard spatial imaging microscope, the TM is
composed of an objective and a tube lens [see Fig. 2.(b)].
The objective is a time lens [9, 10, 12] operating from
sum-frequency generation (SFG) between the 1560 nm

Incoherent light from an 1560 nm Ampliﬁed Spontaneous Emission source (ASE) is ﬁltered by using a Programmable Optical
Filter (POF) and ampliﬁed before experiencing nonlinear propagation in a polarization maintaining (PM) ﬁber. Random
ﬂuctuations of the output power are analyzed in single-shot with sub-picosecond resolution, using a specially designed time-
microscope, which maps the temporal evolution onto the spatial coordinate of a conventional camera (see Fig 2 and Methods
for details). (a-d) Typical single-shot recordings of random waves. Initial spectral width ∆ν = 0.1THz. (a) Initial condition.

signal and a chirped pump pulse (at 800 nm) (see Sec.
Methods). The observation in the focal plane of the tube
lens is achieved by a spectrum analyser (composed of a
diﬀraction grating, a lens and a camera). The use of
this TM strategy enables to easily reach extremely high
dynamical ranges (up to 40 dB, see Methods), which is a
crucial point for analyzing extreme events embedded in
moderate power ﬂuctuations.

In order to quantify the emergence of RWs, we com-
pute statistical distributions from a large amount of data
recorded with the TM at the input and at the output
ends of the ﬁber (see Sec. Methods). As expected, the
probability density function (PDF) of the optical power
emitted by the ASE source is systematically very close to
the exponential distribution that correspond to a Gaus-
sian statistics for the ﬁeld [see Fig. 3.(a)] [8, 15, 27]. On
the contrary, the PDF of light power at the output of the
nonlinear ﬁber is found to exhibit heavy-tailed deviations
from the exponential distribution, thus conﬁrming the
generation of RWs [see Fig. 3.(a)]. Moreover the PDFs
demonstrate that the number of RWs having high peak
power increases while the mean power (cid:104)P(cid:105) of random op-

tical waves (i.e. the strength of nonlinearity) increases
[see Fig. 3.(a)].

To the best of our knowledge, experimental signals
plotted in Figs. 1.(a-d) and 3.(b-h) represent the ﬁrst
direct and accurate observation of the RWs underlying
these heavy tailed statistics.
Starting from random
light propagating with a mean power of 4 W in the
ﬁber, huge RWs having peak power that exceeds 300 W
can be observed at the output of the ﬁber [Fig.3.(d) ].
From a careful analysis of the data, two typical shapes
can be distinguished :
isolated breather-like RWs [see
Fig. 3.(b)] and more complicated structures composed
of several peaks [see Fig. 3.(c)].
In order to illustrate
the process of emergence of breather like RWs, we plot
in Fig. 3.(e-h) diﬀerent structures observed after the
propagation of partially coherent waves having an initial
spectral width ∆ν = 0.05THz and an average power
(cid:104)P(cid:105) = 0.3W. We have selected these structures because
their shapes are strikingly similar to those found in
the scenario leading to the formation of the Peregrine
soliton (PS) while starting from a single hump at initial
stage [28]. Remarkably, the power proﬁle of the exact

analytical PS coincide very well with experimental
structures [see green dashed line in 3.(h)]. However
note that the precise identiﬁcation of the breathers-like
structures (as PS or Akhmediev breather or other
more complex solutions of 1D-NLSE) would require a
simultaneous measurement of the phase dynamics [29].

Behaviors observed in experiments can be well re-
produced from numerical simulations of the 1D-NLSE
(see Sec. Methods). First of all, the PDFs of optical
power [see Fig. 4.(a)] and the optical spectra (see Sup-
plementary Material) are well reproduced by numerical
simulations. Fig. 4 shows a picture of typical random
ﬂuctuations of the optical power that are found at the
input and output ends of the optical ﬁber. Taking a
partially-coherent light ﬁeld having a bandwidth of 0.1
THz at initial stage, the typical time scale for power
ﬂuctuations is around a few picoseconds [Fig. 4(b)]. The
scenari observed in the experiments are also found in
numerical simulations. In particular, either breather-like
structures appear and disappear along the propagation
[see Fig.4(g)],
simultaneously
emerge together from the random background [see Fig.
4(c)]. Our experiments provide snapshots randomly
recorded while the numerical simulations allow to follow
the dynamics of nonlinear random waves along the
propagation. In this respect, the numerical simulations

reveal that the breather-like structures often emerge on
the top of the initial power ﬂuctuations (see Fig. 4(d-g)
and video in Supplementary Material).

In the last years, the common and shared conjecture
is that breather-like solutions of 1D-NLSE such as PS
or Akhmediev breathers represent prototypes of RWs
[13, 16–18, 20–22]. This has motivated very nice experi-
ments in which these solitons on ﬁnite background have
been generated in a deterministic way in optical ﬁbers
[20, 22, 30] and in a one-dimensional water tank [21].
These experiments make use of carefully-designed coher-
ent initial conditions.

On the contrary, the initial conditions in our ex-
periments are designed to be “ocean-like” random
waves [4, 31]. In this context of nonlinear propagation of
random waves, previous experimental works performed
in a 1D water tank [32] and in optical ﬁbers [8] have
revealed heavy-tailed deviations from Gaussian statis-
tics. For the ﬁrst time, our time-resolved observations
correlate in an unambiguous way the occurrence of this
heavy-tailed statistics with the frequent occurence of
breather-like coherent structures. Our experimental
observations favor a well-known scenario in which a PS
emerges from a single real hump [28]. However it must
be emphasized that the precise identiﬁcation of coherent
structures requires the precise knowledge of the phase

evolution. The simultaneaous fast measurement of phase
and amplitude ﬂuctuations therefore represents the next
experimental bottleneck for the careful identiﬁcation of
optical RWs.

The emergence of coherent structures is a general and
mysterious feature of stochastically driven processes such
as turbulence, supercontinuum generation or pattern for-
mation [1, 18, 33]. The time-resolved direct observation
of RWs presented in the letter opens the way to numerous
studies on the relationship betwen coherent structures
and noise driven phenomena. In particular, shot by shot
spectral measurements in pulsed experiments recently re-
vealed the fascinating complexity of the statistical fea-
tures associated to the so called modulation instability
[33]. By using our TM, the underlying dynamics of the
so-called process of noise-driven modulational instability
and its nonlinear stage is an open fundamental question
that can now be studied [15, 33].

METHODS

The partially coherent light (i.e., the initial condi-
tion) is generated by an Erbium ﬁber broadband Am-
pliﬁed Spontaneous Emission (ASE) source (Highwave),
which is spectrally ﬁltered (with programmable shape
and linewidth) using a programmable optical ﬁlter (
Waveshaper 1000S, Finisar). The output is then am-
pliﬁed by an Erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (Keopsys).
This random light is launched into a single-mode po-
larization maintaining ﬁber (Fibercore HB-1550T), with
500 m length and a dispersion β2 = −20 ps2km−1 (mea-
sured). For a given spectral width, the power of the light
launched inside the ﬁber is controlled using a half wave-
length plate and a polarizing cube.

For the single-shot acquisition of the sub-picosecond
optical
signals, we realized an upconversion time-
microscope, largely based on the work of Ref. [10]. From
the input-output point of view, the time microscope en-
codes the temporal shape of the optical signal onto the

spectrum of a chirped pulse (i.e., spectral encoding).
Then the spectrum is recorded using a simple spectrom-
eter composed of a 1800 l/mm grating and a sCMOS
camera. A region of interest (of typically 2048x8 pix-
els) is selected for recording the image (a raw image is
presented in Fig. 2 of the supplementary material).

For reaching high temporal resolution, a key element
is the time-lens [9], which is composed by a BBO crys-
tal, pumped by a chiped 800 nm pulse. Before entering
the time lens, the 1560 nm signal experiences anoma-
lous dispersion in a classic Treacy grating compressor (see
Fig. 2).

As in other time-lens systems [9–12] high resolution
requires proper adjustement of the 1560 nm compressor
(see supplemental material for adjustement detail, and
performances of the setup). Conceptually, this is exactly
analog to the tuning of the object-microscope objective
distance in classical microscopes. For all results pre-
sented in this paper, the temporal resolution is 250 fs
FWHM, and the ﬁeld of view is of the order of 20 ps.

As another crucial point, the time-microscope strategy
leads to an extremely high dynamical range (i.e., the ratio
between maximal recordable signal and dark noise). This
directly stems from the choice of employing a camera for
the recording. More precisely, our 16 bit sCCD camera
has an RMS dark noise of ≈ 2 electrons and a saturation
value of 30000 electrons, leading to a ≈ 40 dB dynamical
range.

The 800 nm pump is provided by an ampliﬁed
Titanium-Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics Spitﬁre, 2 mJ,
40 fs, a spectral bandwidth of about 25 nm), operated at
500 Hz, and only 20 nJ are typically used here. For induc-
ing (normal) dispersion on the 800 nm pulses we simply
adjusted the ampliﬁer’s output compressor. The disper-
sion was ﬁxed to 0.23 ps2, leading to chirped pulses of
duration of about 20 ps. The 1560 nm grating compres-
sor uses two 600 l/mm gratings, operated at an angle of
incidence of 40 degrees, and whose planes are separated
by 42 mm. The BBO crystal has 8 mm length and is
cut for noncollinear type-I SFG. Focusing of the 800 nm
and 1560 nm signals on the BBO crystal are performed
by two lenses with 20 cm focal lengths. In order to im-
prove the rejection of the 800 nm and the 1560 nm and
to keep only the SFG at 528 nm, a 40-nm bandpass ﬁl-
ter around 531 nm (FF01 531/40-25 Semrock) is added
after the crystal. The camera is a sCMOS Hamamatsu
Orca ﬂash 4.0 V2 (C11440-22U), equiped with a 80 mm
lens (Nikkor Micro 60 mm f/2.8 AF-D). The objective is
focused at inﬁnity and the waist of the SFG in the BBO
crystal is imaged on the camera sensor. The camera is
synchronized on the 800 nm laser pulses, and the integra-
tion time is adjusted to 1 ms, thus enabling single-shot
operation of the time-microscope. PDFs of optical power
are computed with 75.106 samples (102 points taken in
the center of the temporal ﬁeld of the TM from 75.104
frames) for a given set of parameters.

are performed using an adaptive stepsize pseudospectral
method, using a mesh of 2048 points, over a temporal
window of ∆T = 250ps.

In numerical simulations presented in this letter, we
neglect linear losses ((cid:39) 0.5dB) and stimulated Raman
scattering. These approximations provide quantitative
agreement between experiments and numerical simula-
tions at moderate powers (< 2W). Additionnal numeri-
cal simulations show that stimulated Raman scattering
has to be taken into account in order to reproduce very
precisely the experimental PDFs and optical spectra at
high values of the mean power (i.e. (cid:104)P(cid:105) = 4W). However
the main physical results (formation of RWs, emergence
of breather-like structures and heavy-tailed PDFs) are
not aﬀected by stimulated Raman scattering.

model in which only the phases φm of the Fourier modes
are considered as being random [34]. In this model, the
phase of each Fourier mode is randomly and uniformly
distributed between −π and π. Moreover, the phases
of separate Fourier modes are not correlated so that <

(δnm = 0 if n (cid:54)= m and δnm = 1 if n = m). With
the assumptions of the RP model above described, the
statistics of the initial ﬁeld is stationary, which means
that all statistical moments of the complex ﬁeld ψ(z =
