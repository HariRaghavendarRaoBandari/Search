We study theoretically and by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations the generation of
mechanical force by grafted polyelectrolytes in an external electric ﬁeld, which favors its adsorption
on the grafting plane. The force arises in deformable bodies linked to the free end of the chain.
Varying the ﬁeld, one controls the length of the non-adsorbed part of the chain and hence the
deformation of the target body, i.e., the arising force too. We consider target bodies with a linear
force-deformation relation and with a Hertzian one. While the ﬁrst relation models a coiled Gaussian
chain, the second one describes the force response of a squeezed colloidal particle. The theoretical
dependencies of generated force and compression of the target body on applied ﬁeld agree very well
with the results of MD simulations. The analyzed phenomenon may play an important role in a
future nano-machinery, e.g. it may be used to design nano-vices to ﬁx nano-sized objects.

INTRODUCTION

Due to its obvious importance for applications, the re-
sponse of polyelectrolytes to external electric ﬁelds has
been of high scientiﬁc interest for the last few decades,
e.g.,
[1–15]. Moreover, novel experimental techniques
that allow exploration of a single polymer chain aided
developments in this area [11].
In fact, the ability of
polyelectrolyte chains to adapt their conformation in ex-
ternal electric ﬁelds, i.e., to change between expanded
and contracted states when the applied ﬁeld varies, is
an important property. It may be used in future nano-
machinery: possible examples of such nano-devices may
be nano-vices or nano-nippers manipulated by an electric
ﬁeld.

Suppose one end of a chain is ﬁxed on a plane (i.e., the
polyelectrolyte is grafted), while the other end is linked to
a nano-sized (target) body that can suﬀer deformation.
If the polyelectrolyte is exposed to an external electric
ﬁeld that favors adsorption at the grafting plane, its con-
formation will be determined by both the ﬁeld and the
restoring force exerted by the deformed target body on
the chain, see Fig. 1. Increased adsorption of the poly-
electrolyte in response to a changing electric ﬁeld will
cause a deformation of the target body and give rise to
a force acting between the chain and target. More pre-
cisely, the force will depend both on the magnitude of
the deformation and the speciﬁc force-deformation rela-
tion of the target body. Hence, by applying an electric

ﬁeld, one can manipulate the conformation of polyelec-
trolyte chains as well as the force aﬀecting the target
body.

The nature of target bodies may be rather diﬀerent,
however, the most important ones with respect to pos-
sible applications seem to be either polymer chains or
nano-particles, e.g., colloidal particles, see Figs. 1 and 2.
In the latter case the force-deformation relation is given
by the Hertzian law, which accurately describes the elas-
tic response of squeezed nano-particles [19, 20]. On the
other hand, polymer chains can exhibit coiled states with
a linear force-deformation relation or stretched confor-
mations with a non-linear relation, e.g. [21]. To describe
the phenomenon it is necessary to express the size of the
polyelectrolyte chain as well as the force acting on the
target body as a function of the applied electric ﬁeld.

In the present study we address the problem theoret-
ically and numerically by means of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. We analyze a model of a polyelec-
trolyte chain grafted to a plane, linked by its free end
to a deformable target body and exposed to an external
electric ﬁeld. The target body is modeled by linear or
non-linear springs with corresponding force-deformation
relations. A time-independent electric ﬁeld is applied
perpendicular to the grafting plane so that it favors com-
plete polyelectrolyte adsorption on the plane. For sim-
plicity we consider a salt-free solution, i.e., there are only
counterions that compensate the charge of the chain. For
intermediate and strong electric ﬁelds (the deﬁnition is

it will be released at zero ﬁeld. The restor-
ing force f corresponds in this case to the Hertzian response
of a compressed sphere. To illustrate a possible device, two
polyelectrolyte chains are sketched, although only one chain,
linked to the Hertzian spring, was used in the simulations
reported, see the right panel.

present our analytical theory, where we calculate the free
energy of the chain and the force acting on the target
body. In Section III the numerical setup is discussed and
in Section IV we present the MD results and compare
them with our theoretical predictions. Finally, in Section
V we summarize our ﬁndings.

II. THEORY

We consider a system, composed of a chain of N0 + 1
monomers, which is anchored to a planar surface at z = 0.
The anchoring end-monomer is uncharged, while each of
the remaining N0 beads carries the charge −qe (e > 0
is the elementary charge); N0 counterions of charge +qe
make the system neutral. The external electric ﬁeld E
acts perpendicular to the plane and favors the adsorption
of the chain, Fig. 3. The free end of the polyelectrolyte
is linked to a deformable body, modeled by a spring with
various force-deformation relations. We study a few dif-
ferent cases. The reaction force f and the energy of de-
formation Usp for a linear spring reads:

f = −κ(h − h0),

Usp =

(h − h0)2.

κ

(1)

Here κ is the elastic constant of the spring and h and
h0 are the lengths of deformed and undeformed spring,
respectively. A linear force-deformation relation corre-
sponds, for instance, to a target body given by a polymer
chain in coiled Gaussian state, e.g. [21]. The correspond-
ing relation for a non-linear spring has the form

f = κ|h − h0|γ sign(h0−h),

|h − h0|γ+1 ,
(2)
where γ > 1 characterizes the stiﬀness of the body, which
may be e.g. a polymer chain in a semi-stretched con-
formational state, i.e., in a state intermediate between a

Usp =

γ + 1

chanical force by electric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld causes chain

given below), additional salt leads to a renormalization
of the surface charge. This happens because the salt co-
ions simply screen the plane leaving the qualitative na-
ture of the phenomenon unchanged. Hence the salt-free
case addressed here is the basic one, which allows a sim-
pler analytical treatment. The general case of a solution
with additional salt ions will be studied elsewhere [22].

Counterions having the same charge sign as the graft-
ing plane are repelled, leaving the chain unscreened see
(see Fig. 1). This feature is dominating if the speciﬁc
volume per chain is not small and the electric ﬁeld is not
weak.
In weak ﬁelds a noticeable fraction of counteri-
ons is located close to the chain, which leads to a partial
screening of the external ﬁeld and of the Coulomb in-
teractions between monomers. Here we consider systems
with a large speciﬁc volume and with ﬁelds that are not
very weak. The screening of the chain in this case may be
treated as a small perturbation. We study the static case
when the current across the system is zero. It is note-
worthy that for the speciﬁc volumes and magnitudes of
the electric ﬁeld addressed here, MD simulations demon-
strate a lack of the counterion screening even at ﬁnite
electric current [13].

Here we present a ﬁrst-principle theory of the phenom-
ena and compare theoretical predictions with MD sim-
ulations results. We observe a quantitative agreement
between theory and MD data for all magnitudes of elec-
tric ﬁeld, except very weak ﬁelds when screening of the
polyelectrolyte becomes signiﬁcant. The simpler problem
of the conformation of a grafted polyelectrolyte exposed
to a constant force in electric ﬁeld, has been explored
theoretically and numerically in a previous study [12].
In Refs. [12, 13] we also reported some simulation results
for a chain linked to a deformable target body along with
our previous simpler theory for the restoring force. In the
present study we develop a ﬁrst-principle theory, based
on a uniﬁed approach that describes the adsorbed part
of the chain as well as the bulk part under the action of
the force from the target body.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we

coiled and stretched one. It is known that stretched poly-
mer chains demonstrate much larger stiﬀness than Gaus-
sian ones [21]. Hence, varying the exponent γ one can
mimic diﬀerent states of a chain. From the point of view
of applications it is worthwhile studying the special case
of a Hertzian spring with γ = 3/2, which corresponds to
the elastic response of a squeezed nano-particle [19, 20],
e.g., a colloidal particle:

2
5

f = κ(h0−h)3/2θ(h0−h), Usp =

κ(h0−h)5/2θ(h0−h).
(3)
Here h0 = dc is the diameter of an unloaded colloidal par-
ticle and h that of the deformed one. The unit Heaviside
step function θ(x) reﬂects the fact that the Hertzian elas-
tic respond arises for compressive deformations only. Al-
though we performed MD simulations only for the above
models of the elastic response, the theoretical analysis is
given for the general case:

A. Free energy of the bulk part of the chain

3

For simplicity, we use the freely jointed chain model
with b being the length of the inter-monomer links, that
is, the size of the monomer beads. The MD simulations
discussed bellow provide a justiﬁcation for this model.
The location of all monomers of the chain is determined
by N0 vectors bi = ri − ri+1, which join the centers
of i + 1-st and i-th monomers (i = 1, 2, . . . N0).
It is
convenient to enumerate the monomers, starting from
the ”free” end linked to the target body. Then the beads
with numbers 1, 2, . . . N refer to the bulk part of the chain
and with numbers N + 1, N + 2, . . . N0 to the adsorbed
part. The N0 + 1-st neutral bead is anchored to the
surface. Let the centers of the adsorbed beads lie at the
plane z = 0, [34] and for simplicity the anchored bead is
located at the origin, rN0+1 = 0. Then the location of
the k-th bead of the bulk part (k = 1, 2, . . . , N ) may be
written as
rk = rk − rk+1 + rk+1 − rk+2 . . . + rN0 − rN0+1 + rN0+1

where again h0 and h are the sizes of undeformed and
deformed target bodies, respectively.

To ﬁnd the polyelectrolyte conformation in electric
ﬁeld and the force acting on the target body we eval-
uate the conditional free energy of the system and mini-
mize it with respect to relevant variables. Let the num-
ber of (charged) monomers adsorbed at the (oppositely
charged) plane be Ns, so that N = N0 − Ns is the num-
ber of monomers in the bulk. Let ztop be the distance of
the ”free” chain end, linked to the target body, from the
charged plane and R – the end-to-end distance of the ad-
sorbed polymer part of Ns monomers. In what follows we
compute the conditional free energy F (N, ztop, R) which
may be written as

F (N, ztop, R) ≈ Fb + Fs + Fbs,

(5)

where Fb = Fb(N, ztop) is the free energy of the system
associated with the bulk part of the chain and the target
body, Fs = Fs(Ns, R) is the free energy of the adsorbed
part of the chain and Fbs = Fbs(N, ztop, R) accounts for
the interactions between the bulk and adsorbed parts.
Minimizing then F (N, ztop, R) with respect to N , ztop
and R one can ﬁnd the conformation of the chain and
the force acting on the target body (see the detailed dis-
cussion below).

In the present study we focus on the range of param-
eters where the polyelectrolyte chain is weekly screened.
This allows us to treat the interaction of the chain with
counterions as a small perturbation and estimate it sep-
arately; this signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes calculations. In what
follows we compute separately diﬀerent parts of the free
energy.

where rN +1 is the radius vector of the N + 1-st bead,
which is a surface bead; it is linked to the N -th bead,
located in the bulk.

where each of the vectors bs has the same length b. Its

imuthal ψs angles, where the axis OZ is directed per-
pendicularly to the grafting plane, Fig. 3. Hence, the
distances between the reference plane z = 0 and the k-th
bead, as well as between the plane and the top bead are

ztop determines its deformation and the elastic energy

(8)

f = − ∂Usp
∂ztop

.

Here ztop,0 is the location of the top bead of the chain
when the target body is not deformed. Because the
chain is assumed to be weakly screened, here we ignore
screening eﬀects, which we estimate later as a perturba-
tion. Then the potential of the external ﬁeld ϕext de-
pends on z simply as ϕext(z) = −Ez, so that the electro-
static energy of k-th bead, associated with this ﬁeld reads
s=k cos θs. Hence the interaction

In the following we ﬁrst compute the partition function
associated with the bulk part of the chain. We impose
the condition that the distance between the surface and
the top bead, attached to the target body, is ztop. Then

where β = 1/kBT , with T being the temperature of the
system and kB is the Boltzmann constant; the energies
Usp, Hext and Hself,b are deﬁned by Eqs. (8)–(11) and the
factor b keeps Zb dimensionless. In Eq. (12) we also as-
sume that the vectors bs can not be directed downwards
(cos θs ≥ 0), which guarantees that the constrain zs > 0,
s = 1, . . . N holds true; this has been conﬁrmed in our
MD simulations.

To proceed we assume that the value of Hself,b may be
approximated by its average over the angles ψ1, . . . ψN ,
that is, Hself,b ≈ (cid:104)Hself,b(cid:105)ψ, hence we assume that the

(15)
which implies that ztop ≤ bN (recall that we consider
a freely joined chain with constant links b) and that
ηs ≈ ztop |s2 − s1| /(b N ). Referring for details to
Appendix A we present here the result for Hself,b, aver-
aged over transverse ﬂuctuations:

Using the integral representation of the δ-function,

where W (ξ) contains the integration over η1, . . . ηN . Its

to estimate the above integral over ξ. Neglecting small

with Ei(x) being the exponential integral function, ζ0 =
ξ0 − ˜E, and ζN = ξ0 − ˜EN . (The complete expression
for Zb and the derivation details are given in the Ap-
pendix B). This yields the free energy, F b(ztop, N ) =
−kBT log Zb(ztop), associated with the bulk part of the
chain without the account of counterions:

βF b(ztop, N ) ≈ βUsp(ztop) + β (cid:104)Hself,b(cid:105)ψ

+ ξ0 ˜ztop − W (ξ0) − N log 2π.

(21)

The impact of counterions on the conformation of the
bulk part of the chain may be estimated as a weak pertur-
bation, so that the bulk component of free energy reads,

Fb(ztop, N ) = F b(ztop, N ) + Fc.ch.(ztop, N )

Here L ( ˜L = L/b) is the size of the system in the OZ-
direction, S is its lateral area and eσc = eqN0/S is the ap-
parent surface charge density, associated with the coun-
terions. The derivation of Fc.ch. is given in Appendix C.
As it may be seen from the above equation, the impact
of the counterions on the chain conformation is small,
provided eσc/E (cid:28) 1 and ˜E ˜L (cid:29) 1. Assuming that these
conditions are fulﬁlled in the case of interest, the above
equation simpliﬁes to

Using the notations of previous section one can write
the radius vector of l-th bead of the adsorbed part of the
bi. Then the radius vector that

sorbed part may be written as

βFs = − log Zs(Ns, R),

V (rs1 − rs2) describes self-
interaction of the adsorbed monomers with the poten-
tial V (ri − rj) deﬁned in Eq. (10). The factor b2 in the
above equation keeps Zs dimensionless. Since we assume
that the adsorbed part of the chain forms a ﬂat two-
dimensional structure, the integration in Eq. (27) is per-
formed over Ns azimuthal angles φ1, . . . φNs, which de-
ﬁne the directions of Ns vectors d1, . . . dNs on the plane.
Note that the evaluation of the conditional partition sum
Zs(R) allows also to estimate the equilibrium conﬁgura-
tion of the adsorbed part of the chain. Using as pre-

can estimate the equilibrium end-to-end distance of the
adsorbed part R. Minimizing Fs(Ns, R) with respect to
R and keeping Ns ﬁxed, (∂Fs/∂R)Ns
= 0, we obtain the

is stretched, R ∼ Ns. Note that the condition of a

Interaction between bulk and adsorbed parts of

the chain

The part of the free energy which accounts for inter-
actions between the bulk part of the chain and adsorbed
part may be estimated as (see the Appendix E for more
detail)

Fbs(N, ztop, R) ≈ (cid:104)Hsb(cid:105)N,ztop,R .

where rl is the radius vector of the l-th monomer of the
bulk part and rm of the m-th monomers of the adsorbed

ztop and R. Using the deﬁnition of vectors bi and dj,

D. Dependence of the force and deformation on

the external ﬁeld

Now we can determine the dependence on the electric
ﬁeld of the polyelectrolyte dimensions as well as the de-
formation of target body. Simultaneously one obtains
the dependence on applied ﬁeld of the force that arises
between chain and target. This may be done minimizing
the total free energy of the system

F (N, ztop, R) = Fb(N, ztop) + Fs(Ns, R) + Fbs(N, ztop, R)
with respect to N , ztop and R and using Ns = N0 − N
and the constrain ztop ≤ bN (see the discussion above).
The above three components of the free energy are given
respectively by Eqs. (22), (31) and (39). This allows to
ﬁnd N , ztop and R as functions of the applied electric
ﬁeld, that is, to obtain N = N (E), ztop = ztop(E) and
R = R(E). Then one can compute the force acting onto
the target body. It reads,

˜f (˜ztop) = ˜E ˜ztop − ˜lBq2N 2(log N − 1)

where ˜f = βbf (ztop), with f (ztop) = −∂Usp/∂ztop being
the reduced force for a particular force-deformation rela-
tion, Eq. (8) and ˜µ = µ/b is the reduced Gouy-Chapman
length. In the above equation we exploit Eq. (19) for ξ0
and the saddle point equation, iztop − ∂W/∂ξ = 0, valid
for ξ = ξ0 (see the Appendix B).

III. MD SIMULATIONS

We report MD simulations of a polyelectrolyte modeled
by a freely jointed bead-spring chain of length N0+1. The
(N0 +1)-th end-bead is uncharged and anchored to a pla-
nar surface at z = 0. All the remaining N0 beads carry
one (negative) elementary charge. Electroneutrality of

the system is fulﬁlled by the presence of N0 monovalent
free counterions of opposite charge, i.e., in our simula-
tions q = 1 . For simplicity, we consider the counterions
to have the same size as monomers. We also assume that
the implicit solvent is a good one, which implies short-
ranged, purely repulsive interaction between all particles,
described by a shifted Lennard-Jones potential. Neigh-
boring beads along the chain are connected by a ﬁnitely
extensible, nonlinear elastic FENE potential. For the set
of parameters used in our simulations, the bond length
at zero force is b (cid:39) σLJ with σLJ being the Lennard-
Jones parameter. All particles except the anchor bead
are exposed to a short-ranged repulsive interaction with
the grafting plane at z = 0 and with the upper bound-
ary at z = Lz. The charged particles interact with the
bare Coulomb potential. Its strength is quantiﬁed by the
Bjerrum length lB = e2/εkBT . In the simulations we set
lB = σLJ and use a Langevin thermostat to hold the tem-
perature kBT = LJ with LJ being the Lennard-Jones
energy parameter. For more details of the simulation
model and method see Refs. [23, 24]. The free end of
the chain is linked to a deformable target body, which is
modeled by springs with various force-deformation rela-
tions. In this study we considered the two cases which
seem to be the most important ones in terms of possi-
ble applications:
linear and Hertzian springs described
by Eqs. (1) and (3), respectively.

In the simulations we use two diﬀerent setups: one
where the spring is anchored at the top plane, Fig. 1,
right panel, while in the second setup the spring is at-
tached to the grafting plane, Fig. 2, right panel. For
simplicity, we assume that the anchor of springs is ﬁxed
and that they are aligned in the direction of the applied
ﬁeld, i.e., perpendicular to the grafting plane. Under
this assumptions, the instantaneous length of the spring
is L − ztop in the ﬁrst case and ztop in the second one,
see Figs. 1 and 2. Here we report simulation results ob-
tained at total chain length N0 = 320. The footprint of
the simulation box is Lx × Ly = 424 × 424 (in units of
σLJ) and the box height is Lz = L = 160.

A typical simulation snapshot is shown in Fig. 3.
We found, that starting from relatively weak ﬁelds of
Eqeb/kBT ≥ 0.1 (recall that qe is the monomer charge),
the adsorbed part of the chain forms an almost ﬂat, two-
dimensional structure. Small loops of the chain rise out
of the plane up to a height of one monomer radius. The
bulk part of the polyelectrolyte is strongly stretched in
perpendicular direction to the grafting plane with the
inter-bead bonds being strongly aligned along the applied
ﬁeld. In sharp contrast to the ﬁeld-free case, [25–31] the
counterion subsystem is practically decoupled from the
polyelectrolyte which drastically simpliﬁes the analysis.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Figs. 4 - 8 we show results of MD simulations com-
In particular,

pared to the predictions of our theory.

particle is modeled by a Hertzian spring with spring con-
stant ˜κ = κb5/2/kBT = 1. The total length of the chain
is N0 = 320. As it may be seen from the ﬁgure, for the
addressed system parameters, counterions are practically de-
coupled from polyelectrolyte.

formed spring.

spring length and magnitude of the induced force are
shown as functions of the applied electric ﬁeld. The
spring length characterizes the deformation of the target
body caused by the force acting from the polyelectrolyte
chain. Fig. 4 refers to a linear spring anchored to the up-
per wall. Figs. 5 – 9 show the behavior of Hertzian springs
of diﬀerent bare equilibrium lengths (i.e. of colloidal par-
ticles of diﬀerent size); these springs are anchored to the
lower wall. The ﬁgures clearly demonstrate the very good
agreement between theory and MD data obtained in our
study. We wish to stress the lack of any ﬁtting parame-
ters used in these plots. Note however, that the theory
has been developed for a highly charged chain with a
relatively strong self-interaction and interaction with the
charged plane. This results in an almost ﬂat 2D structure
of the adsorbed part of the chain and small transversal
ﬂuctuations of the bulk part; the bond vectors of the
bulk part cannot be directed down. Although the theory
is rather accurate, some systematic deviations are ob-
served for very small ﬁelds and for the shortest Hertzian
springs with ztop,0 = 20 b. In the latter case the deforma-
tion of the spring and the force acting on a target body
are slightly underestimated. This possibly happens since
the condition N (cid:29) 1 is not as accurate for short springs
as for long ones. The theory also underestimates the
number of monomer beads N in a bulk for small ﬁelds.
While the theory is rather accurate when ˜E > 1, there
occur noticeable deviations from MD data at small ﬁelds
˜E < 1, see Fig. 9. Fortunately, this deﬁciency of the
new theory with respect to N does not degrade the ac-
curacy of the theoretical dependencies ztop(E) and f (E),

which seem to be the most important quantities in terms
of possible applications. It is noteworthy that for aque-
ous solutions at the ambient conditions, the characteristic
units of force and ﬁeld are kBT /b ≈ kBT /lB ≈ 6 pN and
kBT /be ≈ kBT /lBe ≈ 35 V/µm, respectively. The latter
value is about one order of magnitude smaller than the
critical breakdown ﬁeld for water [32]. Another feature
is worth noting. While the electric ﬁeld alters within a
relatively narrow range, the magnitude of the resulting
force varies over a rather wide range, which is clearly of
great interest for applications.

It is also noteworthy to compare the theoretical results
of the present study with the corresponding results of the
previous simpliﬁed theory, see Ref. [13]. Some represen-
tative examples are shown in Figs. 4 and 6. Obviously
the simpliﬁed theory is accurate for linear springs, except

9

would otherwise perform Brownian motion. At zero or
weak ﬁelds the particle will be released. Using our the-
ory one can compute the magnitude of the ﬁeld needed
to keep the particle ﬁxed, although additional knowledge
about the intensity of the Brownian motion and friction
forces is required. Naturally, one can think about other
nano-size objects, e.g. viruses, cellular organelles or small
bacteria. These objects would be characterized by other
force-deformation relations.

Consider for example nano-vices in aqueous solutions
at the ambient conditions with lB = 0.7 nm. For simplic-
ity we analyze the case of only one chain (see the right
panel of Fig. 2); the generalization for a few chains is
straightforward. Let the polyelectrolyte chain be ﬂexible
and consist of N0 = 180 monomers of size b ≈ lB, each
carrying a charge 1 e. Let the colloidal particle be of di-
ameter d0 = 50b = 35 nm. If we use the Young modulus
Y = 0.01GP, as for rubber [33], for the particle material
and ν = 0.1 for the Poisson ratio, we obtain ˜κ = 2.86 [35].
In this case the ﬁeld ˜E = 1 of about 35 V/µm generates
a force of about 240 pN and the relative deformation of
∆d/d0 = 0.123. 44 monomers remains in the bulk and
136 are adsorbed. If the ﬁeld increases up to ˜E = 2, that
is, up to 70 V/µm, the force increases to about 440 pN,
with the deformation of ∆d/d0 = 0.186 and 41 monomers
in the bulk.

Naturally, there exist plenty of other possible applica-
tions of the mechanism studied, which we plan to address
in future research.

V. CONCLUSION

We analyze the generation of a mechanical force by ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld, applied to a grafted polyelectrolyte
that is linked to a deformable target body. We develop
a theory of this phenomenon and perform MD simula-
tions. The case of strong electrostatic self-interaction of
the chain and its interaction with the charged plane is
addressed. We consider target bodies with two diﬀerent
force-deformation relations, which seem to be the most
important for possible applications: (i) a linear relation
and (ii) that of a Hertzian spring. The ﬁrst relation mod-
els the behavior of a coiled Gaussian chain, while the
second one represents that of a squeezed colloidal parti-
cle. The theoretical dependencies of the generated force
and of the compression of the target body are in a very
good agreement with the simulation data. The theory,
however, underestimates the number of beads N of the
bulk part of the chain for weak ﬁelds and small sizes
of colloidal particles. Interestingly, the generated force
strongly depends on the applied electric ﬁeld. While
the magnitude of the force varies over a wide interval,
the ﬁeld itself alters within a rather narrow range only.
The phenomenon addressed here may play an important
role in future nano-machinery. For instance, it could
be utilized to design vice-like devices (nano-vices, nano-
nippers) that keep nano-sized objects ﬁxed. Other appli-

at small ﬁelds, ˜E < 1. At the same time it fails to satis-
factorily describe the behavior of Hertzian springs. The
simpliﬁed theory drastically underestimates deformation
of a target body at small ﬁelds ( ˜E < 0.5), noticeably un-
derestimates it at intermediate range (1 < ˜E < 3) and
overestimates it in strong ﬁelds ( ˜E > 4). The simpli-
ﬁed theory has an acceptable accuracy only in a rather
narrow ﬁeld interval.

The phenomenon addressed in the present study may
be used in future nano-machinery: A prototype of a pos-
sible nano-device, that may be called a ”nano-vice” or
”nano-nippers” is illustrated in Fig. 2. Here the contrac-
tion of two polyelectrolyte chains in an external electric
ﬁeld allows one to ﬁx ﬁrmly a colloidal particle, which

cations of this phenomenon, which require manipulations
with nano-objects, such as e.g. fusing them together by
an applied pressure are also possible.

may not hold true, neither for the coiled chain nor for
the chain stretched by the force. On the other hand the
assumption ξ0 ∼ N , which yields ξ0 − ˜E ∼ N , implies
that one can apply the approximation log[(ex − 1)/x] (cid:39)

abbreviate ζ0 = ξ0 − ˜E and ζN = ξ0 − ˜EN . Similarly, we
write W (cid:48)(cid:48) as

Finally we obtain the free energy F b(ztop, N ) associated
with the bulk part of the chain (without taking into ac-
count counterions)

βF b(ztop, N ) ≈ βUsp(ztop)+β (cid:104)Hself,b(cid:105)ψ − N log 2π
+ ξ0ztop − W (ξ0) + log |W (cid:48)(cid:48)(ξ0)|1/2. (55)
Note that for N (cid:29) 1 the term containing W (cid:48)(cid:48)(ξ0) is log-
arithmically small as compared to other terms and may
be neglected.

C. Free energy of counterions

The results of the MD simulations show that the coun-
terions are well separated from the chain if the ﬁeld and
volume of the systems are not very small. Therefore the
impact of the counterions on the chain conformation may
be treated as a small perturbation. Here we perform sim-
ple estimates of the free energy of counterions. We can
approximate it as,

Fcount (cid:39) Fc.c. + Fc.E. + Fc.ch.,

where Fc.c.
is the free energy associated with the
counterion-counterion interactions, Fc.E. refers to the free
energy of the counterions interactions with the external
ﬁeld E and Fc.ch. to that with the charged chain. In the
case of interest one can neglect the dependence of Fc.c.
and Fc.E. on the chain conformation, so that we do not
need to compute these terms. At the same time Fc.ch.

can be estimated as the electrostatic energy of the chain
in the additional potential ϕc(z) caused by counterions,

Fc.ch. ≈ N(cid:88)

−qeϕc(zi).

(56)

i=1

To ﬁnd ϕc(z) we start with the equilibrium Boltzmann
distribution of counterions ρc(z) in the external ﬁeld E

where L is the size of the system in the direction along

above equation, we apply the normalization condition,
0 ρc(z)dz = N0. Next we compute the electric ﬁeld
Ec due to counterions, performing the same derivation
as for the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly charged plane

where σc = qN0/S corresponds to the apparent sur-
face charge density due to counterions and ˜L = L/b.
The second term in the above equation, 2πeσc/ε, cor-
responds to the renormalization of the external ﬁeld
E due to the counterion screening of the upper plane,
E → E − 2πeσc/ε. From Eq. (57), ﬁnally we get the
additional potential

ϕc(z) = 2πeσcz/ε − (4πeσcb/ε ˜E)e ˜E(˜z− ˜L).

which yields Eq. (23) of the main text.

D. Computation of Zs(R)

We start with the computation of(cid:10)e−βHself,s(cid:11)
(cid:68)

p. Using
only the ﬁrst-order term in the cumulant expansion of
the exponent we write,

V (rs1−rs2 )(cid:69)

s1(cid:54)=s2(cid:104)V (rs1−rs2 )(cid:105)p.

≈ e

(60)
This is a mean-ﬁeld approximation, which is usually a
good approximation for systems with a long-range inter-
actions. Since V (r) refers to the unscreened Coulomb
interactions, we expect this approximation to be rather
accurate.

Similar as in Eq. (41) we can write,

V (rs1 − rs2) =

dk

(2π)3

˜V (k)eik·(rs1−rs2 ),

(61)

(cid:90)

e− ˜E ˜zi. (59)

where ˜V (k) = (q2e2/ε)(4π/k2) is the Fourier transform
of the interaction potential. This yields,

To derive Eq. (64) we take into account that since Ns (cid:29) 1, only values of G ∼ 1/(b
Ns) contribute to the above
integral. The analysis also shows that R ∼ Nsb (see Eq. (32)), which allows to neglect G as compared to (R/Ns)b2
and to perform the Gaussian integration in the last line of (64). Furthermore we deﬁne

[34] Here we ignore the oﬀ-surface loops of the adsorbed part
of the chain. These may be taken into account [12], but
do not give an important contribution to the total free
energy for the range of parameters addressed here.

[35] The Hertzian force FH depends on the Young modulus
Y , Poisson ratio ν, radius of particle R and deformation
ξ as FH = κξ3/2 = 2

, when x = R2|s2 − s1|/N 2

this guarantees that the discussed approximation has an
acceptable accuracy.
