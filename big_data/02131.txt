Integrability Condition in the Statistical Model

and the Addition Formula of g = 2 Hyperelliptic Function

Kazuyasu Shigemoto1

Abstract

The integrability condition of the Ising model is understood as the SU(2) integrability con-
dition and also as the model parameterized by the elliptic function, where the integrability
condition is understood as the addition theorem of the elliptic function. The generalization
of this integrability condition is to ﬁnd the solution of the higher rank Lie group integrability
condition and also to ﬁnd the model parameterized by higher genus hyperelliptic function.
For the preparation of this purpose, we give the explicit formula of the addition formula for
g = 2 hyperelliptic function.

Introduction

There are many two dimensional integrable statistical models [1]. The fundamental inte-
grable statistical model is the Ising model [2], which is parameterized by the elliptic function
to satisfy the integrable condition. The general Yang-Baxter equation, which has the diﬀer-
ence property, for the spin model is given in the form

U(x)V (x + y)U(y) = V (y)U(x + y)V (x).

(1.1)

This type of Yang-Baxter equation is called the integrability condition, because the Yang-
Baxter equation of this type says that the product of three group actions for two diﬀerent
paths gives the same group action, that is, the product of three group action is path in-
dependent. In general, if we start from some ﬁxed point in the group and multiplying the
group action through certain path to the ﬁnal point in the group, the total group action is
path independent in the above integrable model.

This integrable model seems to have the connection with the algebraic function. The
algebraic function has the addition formula. The addition formula of the trigonometry
function can be written as the U(1) integrable condition in the form Eq.(1.1) through the
Euler’s relation U(x) = exp(ix) = cos(x) + isin(x), V (x) = 1. The addition formula of
the elliptic function can be written as the SU(2) Lie group integrable condition in the form
Eq.(1.1) [3, 4, 5] with

U(x) = exp{iam(x, k)Jz}, V (x) = exp{iam(kx, 1/k)Jx},

(1.2)

where Jx, Jz are Lie group elements of SO(3) ∼= SU(2)/Z2. We must notice that we can
write the integrable condition in the Lie group form by using the elliptic function with some
moduli and the elliptic function with the dual moduli, that is, the Lie group structure and
the discrete moduli transformation is mutually connected.
There are two directions to generalize the above integrable model. One direction of the
generalization is to consider the two variable integrable condition with diﬀerence property
in the form

U(x1, y1)V (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)U(x2, y2) = V (x2, y2)U(x1 + x2, y1 + y2)V (x1, y1). (1.3)

Another direction of the generalization is to consider the higher genus algebraic function,
g = 2 hyperelliptic function, which has two arguments.
Then it is quite desirable that the addition formula of g = 2 hyperelliptic function can be
written in the integrable condition in the from Eq(1.3).
If this expectation is true, the integrable condition (path independence) of the algebraic
function on the Riemann surface, which is nothing but the addition formula of the hyperel-
liptic function, is expected to be written as the integrable condition of certain Lie group.
For that preparation, we explicitly derive the addition formula for g = 2 hyperelliptic func-
tion in this paper.

2 Addition Relation of g = 2 Theta Function

The addition relation of g = 2 hyperelliptic theta function is ﬁrst given by Rosenhain[6, 7],
and K¨onigsberger[8] give the fundamental relation to make the addition theorem.
The explicit addition formula is given by Kossak[9] but he give only the sketch to derive the
addition formula and did not give all the addition formula. Then we will give the detailed
derivation and give all addition formula.
The theta function with two variables is deﬁned by

b d # (u, v; τ1, τ2, τ12)

(2.1)

where we assume that Imτ1 > 0, Imτ2 > 0, (Imτ1)(Imτ2) − (Imτ12)2 > 0 in order that the
summation of m, n ∈ Z becomes convergent. We can rename m → m, n → −n, so that we
can always choose Imτ12 > 0 so we assume Imτ12 > 0.
The Riemann’s theta relation in this case is given by

4 Summary and Discussion

The integrability condition of the Ising model is understood as the SU(2) integrability con-
dition and also as the model parameterized by the elliptic function, where the integrability
condition is understood as the addition theorem of the elliptic function. The generalization
of this integrability condition is to ﬁnd the solution of the higher rank Lie group integrability
condition and also to ﬁnd the model parameterized by higher genus hyperelliptic function.
For the preparation of this purpose, we give the explicit formula of the addition formula for
g = 2 hyperelliptic function.
The trivial case is the SO(4) ∼= [SU(2) ⊗ SU(2)]/Z2 integrable condition in the form

U(x1, y1)V (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)U(x2, y2) = V (x2, y2)U(x1 + x2, y1 + y2)V (x1, y1), (4.1)
where
U(x, y) = ˜U (x, k1) ⊗ ˜U(y, k2),
and
˜U (x, k1) = exp{iam(x, k1)Jz},
˜V (x, k1) = exp{iam(k1x, 1/k1)Jx},

˜V (y, k2) = exp{iam(k2y, 1/k2)Jx}.

˜U (y, k2) = exp{iam(y, k2)Jz},

V (x, y) = ˜V (x, k1) ⊗ ˜V (y, k2),

(4.2)

The algebraic function with non-trivial two argument is g = 2 hyperelliptic function instead
of the direct product of the elliptic function. And we expect that the Lie group integrability
condition will be written as the form of the SU(4) Lie group integrable condition. Because
we have 15 hyperelliptic functions in g = 2 case and all these 15 hyperelliptic functions are
mutually connected in the addition formula, we expect that the number of the hyperelliptic
functions is equal to the number of generators of the Lie group. Then we expect that the Lie
group which is connected with g = 2 hyperelliptic functions is SU(4) because the number of
generators of SU(4) is 15.
We further expect that the addition formula for genus g hyperelliptic function will be written
as the integrable condition of the SU(2g) Lie group, because the number of the hyperelliptic
functions of genus g is equal to 22g − 1 which is equal to the number of generators of SU(2g).
Then the Jacobian varieties will have the SU(2g) Lie group structure through the addition
formula of the theta function.
As the K3 surface can be parameterized by the g = 2 hyperelliptic theta function[10], some
special algebraic varieties may have the Lie group structure.

This is the Kossak’s Fundamental Relation 2) of Eq.(2.6).
Kossak’s Fundamental Relation 3):
From the above, we also have the Kossak’s Fundamental relation 3) of Eq.(2.7) in the form

(A.15)

where we use the relation that the left-hand side of Eq.(A.14) does not change under the
rename of α ↔ β, y ↔ z, y ′ ↔ z′, τ1 ↔ τ2, then the ﬁrst column and the second column
exchanged expression of the theta function in the right-hand side of Eq.(A.14) is equal to
the original expression.
