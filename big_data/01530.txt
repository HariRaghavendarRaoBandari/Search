Abstract

In the following paper we generalize the geometrical framework of a qubit decoherence
model to higher dimensions. A quantum mixed state is represented by a probability dis-
tribution which is the K¨ahler function on the projective Hilbert space. The Markovian
master equation turns out to be the Fokker-Planck equation for the quantum probability
distribution. Several examples are analyzed.

Introduction

The geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics [1, 2, 3, 4] recognizes the projective Hilbert
space PH as the space of quantum states. For every point in PH there exists the corresponding
rank-1 projector |ψihψ| and a ray in the Hilbert space H passing through ψ (see also [5, 6, 7, 8]).
If we choose H = Cn, then the space of states

PH = CP n−1 = U (n)/U (n − 1)

(1)

is an n − 1-dimensional complex space, equipped with the Fubini-Study metric g and the sym-
plectic form ω, such that

K = g + i ω.

(2)
The triple (CP n−1, g, ω) is the K¨ahler space [9]. On this space one can deﬁne the K¨ahler
functions [10] in the following way. A function f : CP n−1 → C is K¨ahlerian iﬀ its Hamiltonian
vector ﬁeld Xf , which is given by the equation d f = ω(Xf , · ), is a Killing vector ﬁeld, that is,
iﬀ it satisﬁes LXf g = 0. These functions form a linear subspace in the space of all functions
F(CP n−1) := {f : CP n−1 → C}.

With every operator A ∈ B(H) one can associate the function fA : CP n−1 → C given by

fA([ψ]) :=

hψ|A|ψi

hψ|ψi

.

Note that, if we take the operators A, B ∈ B(H), C = −2 i[A, B], and D = 2[A, B]+ :=
2(AB + BA), then the corresponding K¨ahler functions fA, fB, fC, fD are connected to each
other by

fC = {fA, fB} = −XfA(fB),

(4)
where {fA, fB} := ω(XfA, XfB ) is the Poisson bracket on CP n−1 deﬁned by the symplectic form
ω, and {fA, fB}+ := g(XfA, XfB )+4fAfB is the symmetric bracket [4] given by the Fubini-Study
metric g.

fD = {fA, fB}+,

Let us introduce (ψ0, ψ1, . . . , ψn−1) ∈ Cn in terms of the octant coordinate system,

(ψ0, ψ1, . . . , ψn−1) = (N0, N1 ei ν1, . . . , Nn−1 ei νn−1),

.

Observe that, from the geometrical point of view, Nk’s form the positive hyperoctant of an
(n − 1)-sphere, whereas the phases νk’s form an (n − 1)-torus [6].

Now, for a given density operator ρ, let us introduce the following function,

p([ψ]) :=

(n − 1)!

πn−1

hψ|ρ|ψi
hψ|ψi

,

so that p([ψ]) is a probability distribution on CP n−1, which means that p([ψ]) ≥ 0 and

ZCP n−1

p([ψ])ω = 1 ,

(9)

(10)

where ω is given by (7). This function corresponds to a legitimate density operator iﬀ p is
a K¨ahler function.
It is worth noting that p describes a pure state ρ = |ψihψ| iﬀ p([ψ]) =
(n − 1)!/πn−1.

Our goal is to apply the introduced geometric structures to the problem of Markovian evolu-
tion and decoherence processes of open quantum systems. Section 2 provides a short description
of general qudit decoherence, whose special cases are then discussed in Sections 3-5. Final
conclusions are gathered in the last section.

2 Time-evolution of Open Quantum Systems

The Markovian master equation has the well-known GKSL form [11, 12],

˙ρt = − i[H, ρt] +

where H – the eﬀective Hamiltonian of the quantum system, Vk – the time-dependent noise
operators satisfying tr V †
k Vl = δkl, tr Vk = nδ0k, γk - the time-dependent decoherence rates. We
will be interested only in the non-Hamiltonian evolution, therefore limiting our discussion to

where L is the generator of the evolution. The above equation can be rewritten with the use of
double bracket structures,

which, in the geometrical language, is equivalent to the following equation for the probability
distribution,

Here, pt = hρti, vk = hVki, and v∗

k denotes the complex conjugation of vk. The above formula is

The time-evolution ρ0 7→ ρt can be given by the following completely positive trace-preserving

with pt = hρti and ak = hAki.

In the precious work [14], the authors analyzed the properties of the random unitary qubit
evolution. Now, we would like to generalize this picture to higher dimensions. However, it turns
out that the noise operators in random unitary evolution lose Hermiticity for n > 2. There-
fore, we need to consider three generalizations: the one that keeps unitarity (Weyl operators),
Hermiticity (Gell-Mann matrices), or both (tensor products of Pauli matrices).

3 Weyl operators

When we are interested in generalizing the two-dimensional case in a way that the unitarity of
the noise operators is preserved, a natural choice is the following form of the master equation,

˙ρt =

1

Xk1,k2=0

γ(Uk1k2)(cid:16)Uk1k2ρtU †

k1k2 − ρt(cid:17).

(18)

Here, γ(Uk1k2) is just another symbol for γk1k2. The noise operators Uk1k2 are the Weyl operators,
which are deﬁned by (c.f. [16])

From the above equation, we get the following conditions for the positivity of the solution,

n−1

Xj1,j2=0

γ(uk1k2) 1 − Re Ωk2j1−k1j2! ≥ 0.

The CPT map that describes the evolution ρ → ρt reads as follows,

Λt(ρ) =

It describes the Markovian evolution iﬀ it satisﬁes the BLP conditions [15],

where ρ1 and ρ2 are arbitrary initial states. Note that (23) agrees with the BLP conditions
calculated in [16].

4 Gell-Mann matrices

By choosing the generalization in which the Hermiticity of the noise operators is preserved, the
formula (12) can be rewritten with the use of a double commutator structure,

˙ρt = −

Xk1,k2=0

In general, the eigenfunctions of the generator are time-dependent. This makes ﬁnding the
eigenvalue formulas highly problematic. However, if we narrow down our interest to the case
in which γS
k1k2 =: γ, then it turns out that fk1k2’s are the desired eigenfunctions. Their
corresponding eigenvalues are listed below:

∆pt,

(29)

(30)

with ∆ being the Laplacian on CP n−1. This corresponds to the dephasing channel for a qunit.
Moreover, every isotropic evolution whose noise operators are given by a unitary rotation of the
Gell-Mann matrices leads to the same dynamical equation for pt.

Lemma 1. Every dipole K¨ahler function fk1k2 , i.e. k1 6= 0 and k2 6= 0, is an eigenfunction of
the Laplace operator,

∆fk1k2 = −4nfk1k2.

(31)

Proof. Let us start from the isotropic (γk = 1) algebraical master equation 26 for a traceless
density operator ρ,

˙ρ = −

where τk are the Gell-Mann matrices, and

In the geometrical framework, the above equation is equivalent to

Therefore, the eigenvalue equation for the Laplace operator reads

for k 6= 0.

5 Tensor products of Pauli matrices

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

It turns out that there is a way to keep the noise operators in higher dimensions both unitary
and Hermitian. To make that possible, however, we need to limit our discussion to very speciﬁc
dimensions of the Hilbert space. Let us write down the following master equation,

˙ρt =

1
2

3

Xk1,...,kN =0

γ(ηk1...kN )(cid:16)ηk1...kN ρtηk1...kN − ρt(cid:17),

where the noise operators ηk1...kN are tensor products of Pauli matrices σkj ,

ηk1...kN =

σkj ,

N

Oj=1

(39)

(40)

and the Hilbert space dimension n = 2N . Similarly to the case of the Gell-Mann matrices, the
master equation (39) reduces to a simpler formula with the double commutator structure,

˙ρt = −

1
4

3

Xk1,...,kN =0

γ(ηk1...kN )[ηk1...kN , [ηk1...kN , ρt]].

(41)

In the geometrical formulation, the master equation (39) takes the form of

˙pt =

Xk1,...,kN =0

γ(mk1...kN )X 2

mk1 ...kN

pt =

∆γpt,

where mk1...kN = hηk1...kN i, and ∆γ := 1

.
The CPT map satisfying (39) has the following Kraus representation,

k1,...,kN =0 γ(mk1...kN )X 2

mk1...kN

ρt = Λt[ρ] =

π(ηk1...kN )ηk1...kN ρ0ηk1...kN ,

4P3
Xk1,...,kN =0

which is equivalent to the following equation for pt,

pt =  1

∆π + 1!p0.

Substituting (44) into (42), we obtain the following formula describing the dependence between
γ’s and π’s,

6 Conclusions

The following paper describes the decoherence of a qunit within the geometrical formulation
of quantum mechanics. We show that the Markovian master equation for density operators is
equivalent to the Fokker-Planck equation for quantum probability distributions.

It turns out that there are three natural generalizations of the qubit case, where we choose
diﬀerent operators in the place of the noise operators. For the Weyl operators, a certain choice of
the decoherence rates results in the generator being a linear combination of squared modules of
the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds corresponding to the Weyl operators. For the Gell-Mann matrices,
on the other hand, the generator of the evolution is the generalized Laplacian on CP n−1, similarly
to the two-dimensional case [14]. It is easy to show that for the isotropic case this simpliﬁes to
the Laplace operator. Finally, in the case of tensor products of the Pauli matrices, we arrive
at a simple equation describing the dependence between the decoherence rates and probability
distribution present in the Kraus decomposition.
