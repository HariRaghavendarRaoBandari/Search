ABSTRACT
We present results of a set of three-dimensional, general relativistic radiation magnetohydro-
dynamics simulations of thin accretion discs to test their thermal stability. We consider two
cases, one that is initially radiation-pressure dominated and expected to be thermally unstable
and another that is initially gas-pressure dominated and expected to remain stable. Indeed, we
ﬁnd that cooling dominates over heating in the radiation-pressure-dominated case, causing the
disc to collapse vertically on the local cooling timescale. On the other hand, the gas-pressure-
dominated case, which was run for twice as long as the radiation-pressure-dominated case,
remains stable, with heating and cooling roughly in balance. Because the radiation-pressure-
dominated disc collapses to the point that we are no longer able to resolve it, we had to
terminate the simulation. Thus, we do not know for sure whether it might ﬁnd a much thinner,
stable solution or if it will make a transition to unstable expansion and exhibit limit-cycle be-
havior. However, the fact that the cooling rate seems to be dropping faster than heating as the
disc collapses suggests that the disc may be headed toward a stable, albeit thinner, solution. It
is not clear, though, if the disc will remain radiation-pressure-dominated in that new state.

INTRODUCTION

It has been over forty years since the seminal paper on geomet-
rically thin accretion discs was published by Shakura & Sunyaev
(1973). This model prescribed three diﬀerent regions in such discs:
a radiation-pressure-dominated (inner) region, with the dominant
opacity due to electron scattering; a gas-pressure-dominated (mid-
dle) region, with the dominant opacity again due to electron scat-
tering; and a gas-pressure-dominated (outer) region, with opacity
due to free-free absorption. Soon after publication, linear stability
analysis of the radiation-pressure-dominated region indicated that
it should be unstable (Shakura & Sunyaev 1976).

The origin of this instability is the assumption that the anoma-
lous stress, τrφ, that drives accretion is proportional to the total (gas
plus radiation) pressure. This actually leads to two instabilities, one
being thermal (Shakura & Sunyaev 1976) and the other viscous
(Lightman & Eardley 1974). In this work we are mainly focused
on the thermal instability. The necessary and suﬃcient condition
proposed by Piran (1978) shows that the thermal instability orig-
inates due to the diﬀerent dependence of the heating and cooling
rates per unit area on the disc mid-plane temperature, for a con-
stant surface density, Σ. The ratio of heating rate per unit area to
cooling rate per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the

mid-plane temperature (Piran 1978). This leads to excess heating,
resulting in an expanding disc. In numerical simulations, it can also
happen that cooling dominates heating, such that the disc collapses
(Jiang, Stone & Davis 2013; Sa¸dowski 2016). All of this assumes
that any magnetic ﬁelds in the disc are weak. If strong magnetic
ﬁelds are present, they can, in principle, stabilize the disc (Begel-
man & Pringle 2007; Oda et al. 2009; Sa¸dowski 2016).

In recent years, local, shearing-box (Brandenburg et al. 1995;
Stone et al. 1996) numerical simulations have been performed to
study the thermal stability of radiation-pressure-dominated discs
(Turner 2004; Hirose, Krolik & Blaes 2009; Jiang, Stone & Davis
2013). The ﬁrst radiation MHD simulation using a stratiﬁed shear-
ing box was performed by Turner (2004). In this simulation, even
with a radiation-to-gas pressure ratio of ∼ 14, the disc did not show
any thermal instability. However, these results are suspect, due to
the fact that the photosphere was not captured within the simula-
tion domain (during the expansion phase caused by heating). Fur-
thermore, half of the mass was lost from the boundaries of the sim-
ulation box and 27% of work done on the box disappeared due
to numerical losses. Hirose, Krolik & Blaes (2009) repeated the
radiation-pressure-dominated shearing box simulations with a bet-
ter energy conservation scheme and larger box to retain both (top
and bottom) photospheres within the simulation domain. They also
greatly reduced the mass loss through the box boundaries. These
simulations, too, showed no thermal instability. The analytic and

numerical results were thus in conﬂict until new shearing box simu-
lations were performed by Jiang, Stone & Davis (2013). Depending
on the central density and the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pres-
sure, Jiang, Stone & Davis (2013) found all of their discs to either
expand or collapse on a timescale of tens of orbits. They were also
able to demonstrate that the previous contradictory results were ow-
ing to the use of too small boxes.

We expand the previous shearing box results into the domain
of global simulations using the Cosmos++ general relativistic ra-
diation magnetohydrodynamic (GRRMHD) code (Anninos, Frag-
ile & Salmonson 2005; Fragile et al. 2012; Fragile, Olejar & An-
ninos 2014). We compare two general cases, one gas-pressure-
dominated, the other radiation-pressure-dominated. The radiation-
pressure-dominated case has parameters chosen to closely match
those of one of the unstable shearing-box cases of Jiang, Stone &
Davis (2013).

2 NUMERICAL SETUP
2.1
Initial conﬁgurations

In order to make connections with previous shearing box (esp.
Jiang, Stone & Davis 2013) and global, thin-disc (Reynolds &
Miller 2009) simulations, instead of starting from the Shakura-
Sunyaev solution, we initialized a slab of gas of uniform thickness,
orbiting everywhere at the local Keplerian frequency. We chose a
black hole mass, MBH = 6.62M(cid:12), for close comparison with Jiang,
Stone & Davis (2013). The initial density proﬁle of the azimuthally
symmetric disc is

ρ(R, z) =

ρ0e−z2/2H2
1 + e(Ri−R)/H ,

where ρ0 is the mid-plane density, H is the initial height of the
disc, and Ri is the inner radius of the initial disc. We ﬁx the initial
inner radius to that of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and
use an exponential cutoﬀ to smooth the transition there. The initial
disc structure is thus entirely governed by the chosen mid-plane
density and disc height. We consider two cases, one with mid-plane
density ρ0 = 10−3 g cm−3 and H = 0.4rg, where rg = GM/c2 is the
gravitational radius, and the other with ρ0 = 10−6 g cm−3 and H =
0.3rg. The ﬁrst case matches the RSVET model in the shearing-box
simulations of Jiang, Stone & Davis (2013). The Jiang, Stone &
Davis (2013) simulations were done for a section of disc centered
at R = 30rg, whereas we are performing global simulations, so
the correspondence is imperfect. In our case, the disc is initially
radiation pressure dominated, with 10 (cid:46) Prad/Pgas (cid:46) 1000. We refer
to this setup as RADPLR or RADPHR depending on the resolution
used (see Table 1).

For RADPHR and RADPLR, we assume that the gas and radi-
ation are initially in local thermal equilibrium (LTE), which means
the total pressure is distributed between the two (magnetic pressure
is initially negligible), as

Ptot = Pgas + Prad ,
where the total pressure, Ptot, is deﬁned by the disc vertical equilib-
rium equation

where aR = 4σ/c is the radiation constant. This is a quartic equa-
tion for the gas temperature with four possible roots, though only
one is positive and real.

(4)

The second case we consider is somewhat diﬀerent in terms of
its thermodynamic properties. This lower density case is gas pres-
sure dominated, with 10−11 (cid:46) Prad/Pgas (cid:46) 10−7 for entire disc. We
refer to this setup as GASPLR or GASPHR, again depending on
the resolution (Table 1). GASPHR and GASPLR have an initial
disc thickness H = 0.3rg. In this case, we do not assume LTE, ini-
tially. Instead, we deﬁne a uniform, initial radiation temperature,
Trad = 104 K, considerably below the initial gas temperature.

2.2 Radiation ﬁelds
The M1 closure scheme in Cosmos++ (Fragile, Olejar & Anni-
nos 2014) evolves the radiation energy density in the radiation rest
frame, ER, and the spatial components of the radiation rest frame
4-velocity, ui
R (see Section 2.5). However, it is easier to initialize
our simulations by deﬁning the radiation ﬁelds in the ﬂuid frame.
We already described in the previous section how we determine the
initial radiation temperature, Trad. This temperature can be used to
deﬁne the radiation energy density in the ﬂuid frame
Erad = aRT 4
The initial radiative ﬂux, Fi, is then calculated from the gradient
of Erad. With these quantities, we can construct the contravariant
radiation stress-energy tensor

rad .

(5)

where hαβ = gαβ + uαuβ is the projection tensor and uα is the ﬂuid
4-velocity.

Since the radiation stress-energy tensor is invariant, it must be
the same in all frames. This allows us to equate the radiation stress-
energy tensor from equation (6) to the form written in terms of the
radiation rest frame variables:

Following Sa¸dowski et al. (2013) and Fragile, Olejar & Anninos
(2014), we start with the following two relationships, both of which
come from equation (7):

Using these, we solve for the radiation energy density in the radi-
ation rest frame, ER, and the time component of the radiation rest
frame four-velocity, ut
R. With these, the remaining spatial compo-
nents of the radiation rest frame 4-velocity, ui
R, can easily be ob-
tained from equation (7).

2.3 Magnetic ﬁeld setup

Substituting the expressions for radiation pressure (in local thermo-
dynamic equilibrium) and ideal gas pressure into equation (2), we
have

To seed the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) inside the disc, we
impose a weak magnetic ﬁeld (β = Ptot/Pmag (cid:62) 10) on top of our
hydrodynamical setup. The MRI is necessary to drive the accretion
c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–10

of matter into the black hole and transport angular momentum out-
wards (Balbus & Hawley 1991). The turbulence of the MRI will
also heat the disc, which is important to our goal of studying ther-
mal stability.

It is important for the initialized magnetic ﬁeld to be diver-
gence free. The easiest way to accomplish this is to initialize the
magnetic ﬁeld starting from the vector potential. For our thin discs,
we set Ar = Az = 0 and

and RISCO is the radius of the ISCO. The eﬀect is to create small
magnetic ﬁeld loops of roughly the same size as the disc height and
alternating polarity centered along the mid-plane of the disc. The
generalized curl of the vector potential
Bi = i jk∂ jAk
then gives the appropriate magnetic ﬁeld components. The strength
of the magnetic ﬁeld is scaled to match the chosen β. In order to
keep the magnetic ﬁeld divergence free during the evolution, we use
the staggered, constrained transport scheme described in Fragile
et al. (2012).

(12)

2.4 Grid parameters

In thin-disc simulations, a big challenge is to have enough resolu-
tion to capture the MRI. To help with this, we adopt a cylindrical,
Kerr-Schild coordinate system computed by transformation from
the usual spherical Kerr-Schild coordinate system (R = r sin θ and
z = r cos θ). To further improve the resolution near the disc mid-
plane, we space the nz = 160 zones using a logarithmic coordinate
x3 = ± ln

(cid:32) nz|z| − Lz

(13)

(cid:33)

,

Lz

where Lz = 20H is the total box height and the sign of the expres-
sion comes from the sign of z. We also employ a logarithmic grid
in the radial direction with nR = 192 zones spaced as

x1 = 1 + ln

,

(14)

where rBH is the black hole radius. The radial domain runs over
4rg (cid:54) R (cid:54) 40rg. A linear spacing is used along the azimuthal di-
rection, φ, with nφ = 32 (low resolution) or nφ = 64 (high reso-
lution). To reduce the computational expense we only simulate the
0 (cid:54) φ (cid:54) 0.5 π wedge in the azimuthal direction.

We use outﬂow boundary conditions in the inner radial and
top and bottom vertical boundaries, which means all the gas vari-
ables except the normal component of the ﬂow velocity are copied
from the last active zones to the ghost zones. If the normal veloc-
ity component points outward, then it, too, is copied to the ghost
zone. Otherwise, it is adjusted such that the normal component of
the velocity is zero at the boundary face. The outer radial boundary
uses a constant boundary condition, which means that all variables
will retain their initial values in the outer radial ghost zones. The
azimuthal boundary conditions are periodic.

2.5 Radiative GRMHD scheme

We solve the coupled radiative magnetohydrodynamics equations
using the M1 closure scheme to handle both the optically thick and
thin limits (Fragile, Olejar & Anninos 2014). Along with the ra-
diation stress-energy tensor, deﬁned in equation (7), we need the
MHD stress-energy tensor

We aim to solve the following set of conservation equations

where ρ is rest mass density, ε is speciﬁc internal energy, Pgas is
gas pressure, deﬁned using the ideal gas equation of state, Pgas =
(γ−1)ρε, with γ = 5/3, and bα is the contravariant magnetic 4-ﬁeld,
measured by an observer co-moving with ﬂuid.

together with the induction equation for the magnetic ﬁelds. In
equations (17) and (18), Gα is the radiation 4-force density, which
couples the ﬂuid and radiation ﬁelds. This term includes normal
scattering, absorption, and emission, as well as thermal Comp-
tonization of the radiation. We do not include the relativistic cor-
rections to thermal Comptonization, as we make the simplifying
assumption that Compton scattering is symmetric in the ﬂuid frame
(hence, there is no associated momentum exchange). The form of

3 RESULTS

In this section, we present results of our two main simulations.
In the ﬁrst, we ﬁnd that our geometrically-thin, optically-thick,
radiation-pressure-dominated disc collapses vertically on the cool-
ing timescale. The second simulation of an apparently stable, gas-
pressure-dominated disc of similar height supports our claim that
the ﬁrst result is not a spurious numerical result.

3.1 Diagnostics

Each simulation is post-processed in order to extract the thermody-
namic and geometric properties of the disc. We mainly use density-
weighted shell- and time-averaged quantities, as well as space-
time diagrams to present our results. A general expression for the
density-weighted shell-average of a quantity is given by the follow-
ing expression:

where dAR is an area element normal to the radial direction. A time
average of this quantity is computed as

For the height of the disc we use a density-squared weighting:

as it agrees better with our target height than other possible expres-
sions, where z0 = 0 represents the disc mid-plane.

We also track the photosphere of each disc, which we deﬁne
as the τ = 1 surface. The optical depth, τ, comes from integrating
the quantity κρ from zmin to the disc mid-plane and similarly from
zmax to the disc mid-plane:

deﬁned as

3.2 Radiation-pressure-dominated disc

The goal of this setup (RADPHR/RADPLR) is to study the thermal
stability of a radiation-pressure-dominated disc. Before address-
ing the thermal stability, though, we present a general overview
of this simulation. Fig. 1 shows R − z slices of the initial (left) vs.
ﬁnal (right) distribution of mass density (upper panel), temperature
(middle panel), and the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure
(lowest panel) for the RADPHR simulation. We clearly see in the
upper-right panel that the disc collapses to a very thin structure.
The middle-right panel shows that the disc cools down by an order
of magnitude with respect to its initial gas temperature. The lower-
right panel shows that during the entire simulation the radiation
pressure remains dominant within the disc.
In Fig. 2 we show additional R − z slices of this simulation,
now time averaged over the last t = 1000 GM/c3. The top panel
shows mass density again with streamlines of the azimuthally av-
eraged ﬂuid velocity. The photosphere is shown with cyan solid
curves. Again we see that the disc has collapsed to a very thin
height. The streamlines also indicate that material is continuing to
fall toward the mid-plane. In this case, we terminated the simula-
tion where we did, because we can no longer resolve the disc. The
middle panel shows the radiation energy with streamlines of the
azimuthally averaged radiation velocity. We see in this panel that
the radiation escapes vertically from the disc, which is expected
for geometrically thin discs. The lowest panel shows the ratio of

the magnetic pressure to the sum of the radiation and gas pressures
(Pr+g = Prad + Pgas), with streamlines of the azimuthally averaged
magnetic ﬁeld. There is a deﬁnite radial structure to the magnetic
ﬁeld lines in the background gas, while the ﬁeld is more turbu-
lent near the disc mid-plane. Magnetic pressure never dominates
in the body of the disc during the entire simulation, though in the
background it certainly does. Thus, we do not expect the disc to be
stabilized by the magnetic ﬁelds.

In Fig. 3 we show a spacetime plot of the azimuthally aver-
aged radial proﬁle of disc height, computed using equation (31).
Importantly, the ﬁgure shows that the height initially increases af-
ter one local MRI growth time, which corresponds to the local or-
bital timescale (dashed curve). This is due to fact that the MRI is
responsible for heating up the disc, allowing it to expand vertically.
Subsequently, the disc collapses on a timescale comparable to the
local cooling time (solid white curve), which is computed as

ing at the time evolution of the local heating and cooling rates. In
Fig. 6, we show a spacetime plot of the ratio of the heating rate to
the cooling rate, computed using equations (33) and (34), respec-
tively. The important takeaway is that cooling dominates over heat-
ing everywhere in the disc until after the disc has collapsed, when
heating appears to dominate. Heating also dominates over cooling
inside the ISCO, but this has little impact on our results.

The crucial question, though, is whether the disc collapses due
to a true thermal instability. To assess this, we need to look at how
the heating and cooling rates respond to changes in the total mid-
plane pressure, which we do in Figs. 7 and 8. Fig. 7 seems to in-
dicate that there is very little correlation between the bulk heating
rate in the disc and the mid-plane pressure. Fig. 8, on the other
hand, shows a strong, positive correlation between the cooling rate
and the mid-plane pressure. So, while cooling has clearly domi-
nated over heating during the evolution of model RADPHR (and
RADPLR), this dominance weakens as the disc collapses. It ap-
pears that, at some point, heating will become more important than
cooling. There are already some sings of this in Fig. 6 at late times.

where dV is the volume of a given radial shell within the pho-
tosphere. The numerator corresponds to the total thermal energy
within this volume. The disc collapse negates the initial expansion
such that the ﬁnal height is at least a factor of ﬁve smaller than the
initial one. We show a similar spacetime plot for the height of our
low-resolution, RADPLR case in Fig. 4. Comparing Figs. 3 and 4,
we see that it takes somewhat longer for the disc to collapse in our
high-resolution simulation. It could be that at even higher resolu-
tion we might ﬁnd that the disc will take even longer to collapse.
This point will have to await future simulations.

The vertical collapse of the disc can also be seen in Fig. 5,
which shows a spacetime plot of the radially and azimuthally aver-
aged density as a function of height, z. The narrowing of the plot
with time reﬂects the collapse of the disc. As the disc is collaps-
ing, the photosphere (white curve) actually moves away from the
mid-plane. This is because the opacity, κρ, goes roughly as ρ2T−7/2.
Thus, the rising density and falling temperature both drive the opac-
ity of the gas up.

Another clue to the thermal state of the disc comes from look-

This suggests that the disc is actually evolving toward a thermally
stable solution.

In Fig. 9, we show the surface density, Σ, of the disc. This
illustrates that Σ remains nearly constant throughout the simulation.
This is important as it ensures that the disc collapse is not due to
matter being drained into the black hole.

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the RADPHR
and RADLR simulations are initialized with the disc being radi-
ation pressure dominated. In Fig. 10 we show that it remains so
throughout the simulation. Obviously the region inside the ISCO is
strongly radiation pressure dominated. This is not surprising as this
region is largely devoid of gas, but ﬁlled with radiation (compare
the top and middle panels of Fig. 2).

3.3 Gas-pressure-dominated disc

In the previous section we identiﬁed that our radiation-pressure-
dominated thin disc is unstable to collapse. In this section, we con-
trast that result with a baseline, gas-pressure-dominated simulation.

simulation.

Figure 11. Same as Fig. 3, but for the GASPLR simulation. The local cool-
ing time in this simulation is too short to be included in this plot.

The primary goal in performing this simulation is to ensure that the
result of the previous section is not a numerical artifact and that,
indeed, our numerical setup is able to evolve stable thin disc con-
ﬁgurations for suﬃciently long duration. Here we focus on the low-
resolution simulation, GASPLR, as it ran for signiﬁcantly longer
than its high-resolution counterpart. Even so, it did not run long
enough to achieve inﬂow equilibrium through much of the radial
domain. If the goal was really to understand the behavior of this
disc, then this simulation should be run even longer. However, we
were able to run it for many thermal times, long enough to provide
a convincing counter-example to our collapsing disc.

We start with a spacetime plot of the disc height (Fig. 11),
comparable to Figs. 3 and 4. In it we see that the region inside of
≈ 16rg maintains a nearly constant height following the onset of the
MRI (dashed line). The local cooling time for this setup is of the
order of 0.01 GM/c3, which is much shorter than in the radiation-
pressure-dominated case. This is due to the fact that this setup has
a mid-plane density three orders of magnitude lower than RADP.
Also, the maximum mid-plane temperature for this setup is two or-
ders of magnitude higher than RADP case. However, the GASPLR
simulation does exhibit some thinning in its outer regions, an eﬀect
that was also seen in the radiation-pressure-dominated simulations.
We suspect this is due to the fact that the MRI is not suﬃciently
well resolved in those regions (see Sec. 3.4), which allows cooling
to dominate.

In Fig. 12 we show a space-time plot of the ratio of heating
to cooling in the GASPLR case. We see that heating and cooling
are nearly in balance over time over most of the disc. However,
in the outer regions and at late times, there are parts of the disc
where cooling dominates. As with the collapsing scale height in
these regions, we attribute this behavior to the under resolved MRI.
In Fig. 13 we show the vertical proﬁle of the radially and az-
imuthally averaged mass density for the GASPLR simulation. As
with Fig. 11, we ﬁnd that the gas-pressure-dominated disc main-
tains its height much better than the radiation-pressure-dominated
one. The growth in the mid-plane density at late times is dominated
by the thinning of the outer regions (R > 20) of the disc (also seen
in Fig. 11). The photosphere height (white curves) is also much
more stable in this case.

3.4 Caveats

One major concern in performing numerical simulations of very
thin accretion discs is resolving the MRI. Multiple resolution stud-
ies have shown that nearly all global simulations done to date have
been under-resolved in this regard (e.g. Hawley, Guan & Krolik
2011; Hawley et al. 2013). A particular worry in our case is that
under-resolving the MRI might cause the disc to collapse due to in-
suﬃcient heating. Admittedly, as we show, some of our simulations
fall below the ideal resolution. This is an unfortunate limitation of
trying to perform global simulations, and doing so for thin discs
only exacerbates the problem. However, an attempt to perform such
thin disc simulation is necessary to make progress in understanding
the physics of thin discs.

The standard measure of MRI resolution is the so-called Q

parameter, deﬁned as

λMRI,i
∆xi

,

(38)

Qi =

MRI mode, ∆xi is a typical zone length, and vA,i = (cid:112)

where λMRI,i = 2πvA,i/|V φ| is the wavelength of fastest growing
bibi/ρ is
Alfven speed, all in a given direction, i. We checked both the verti-
cal (Fig. 14) and azimuthal (Fig. 15) MRI Q parameters for most of
the models in Table. 1. For our radiation-pressure-dominated sim-
ulations, we actually capture the vertical MRI well, with Q2 (cid:38) 10
throughout most of the disc, especially in simulation RADPHR.
The gas-pressure-dominated simulation is not nearly as well re-
solved, with Q2 (cid:46) 3 at nearly all radii. The azimuthal direction is
more problematic, with Q3 (cid:46) 5, even in the high-resolution RAD-
PHR case. One way to possibly improve this in future simulations
without requiring even more computational resources would be to
reduce the azimuthal extent of the domain, while keeping the num-
ber of zones ﬁxed. For now, we are left to point to the similarity of
our results in both the low- and high-resolution simulations as evi-
dence that the poor azimuthal MRI resolution does not negate our
results of a thermal collapse in our radiation-pressure-dominated
disc.

4 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

These are among the ﬁrst global simulations of geometrically
very thin discs in general relativity to include radiation (see also
Sa¸dowski 2016). Our results are designed to be directly compara-
ble to the shearing box simulations of Jiang, Stone & Davis (2013),
thus extending their results to global simulations. The major con-
clusions of our paper are:

(i) As with previous shearing box (Jiang, Stone & Davis 2013)
and global simulations with weak magnetic ﬁelds (Sa¸dowski 2016),
we ﬁnd radiation-pressure-dominated thin discs to collapse. In our
RADPHR simulation, cooling dominated over heating throughout
the disc, at least until late times.

(ii) Our baseline gas-pressure-dominated simulation remained
stable, with cooling and heating remaining roughly in balance
throughout the disc. This conﬁrms that our Cosmos++ GRRMHD
code is able to simulate stable, radiative, thin discs. It also supports
the conclusion that the collapse we found in the radiation-pressure-
dominated case is not a numerical artifact.

(iii) The fact that the radiation-pressure-dominated disc col-
lapses on roughly the local cooling time also suggests that the col-
lapse is not due to numerical eﬀects, such as under-resolved MRI,
though we readily admit that there is room for improvement in
this area in our simulations, particularly in the azimuthal direction.
However, a comparison of our low- and high-resolution simulations
suggests that our main conclusions are robust.

It is not clear from our results, however, whether the collapse
of our RADP simulations is due to a true thermal instability. Anal-
ysis of the dependence of our heating and cooling rates on the mid-
plane pressure (Figs. 7 and 8) suggests it is not. Instead, the disc
appears to be moving toward an even thinner, but possibly stable,
ﬁnal state. This highlights the importance of carefully analyzing the
thermodynamics of radiation MHD simulations of thin discs.

As with any numerical study, there are caveats to our results.
We have only studied the stability of two disc conﬁgurations for
relatively short evolution times. A broader parameter study with
longer simulations will be required to make our conclusions more
robust. However, these simulations are very expensive computa-
tionally, so a broader study will have to wait.
