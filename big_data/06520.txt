ABSTRACT
Planet Nine is a hypothetical planet located well beyond Pluto that has been proposed in an
attempt to explain the observed clustering in physical space of the perihelia of six extreme
trans-Neptunian objects or ETNOs. The predicted approximate values of its orbital elements
include a semimajor axis of 700 au, an eccentricity of 0.6, an inclination of 30◦, and an argu-
ment of perihelion of 150◦. Searching for this putative planet is already under way. Here, we
use a Monte Carlo approach to create a synthetic population of Planet Nine orbits and study
its visibility statistically in terms of various parameters and focusing on the aphelion conﬁg-
uration. Our analysis shows that, if Planet Nine exists and is at aphelion, it might be found
projected against one out of four speciﬁc areas in the sky. Each area is linked to a particular
value of the longitude of the ascending node and two of them are compatible with an apsi-
dal anti-alignment scenario. In addition and after studying the current statistics of ETNOs, a
cautionary note on the robustness of the perihelia clustering is presented.

1 INTRODUCTION

Batygin & Brown (2016) have predicted the existence of a massive
planet well beyond Pluto in order to explain the observed clustering
in physical space of the perihelia of the extreme trans-Neptunian
objects or ETNOs (90377) Sedna, 2004 VN112, 2007 TG422,
2010 GB174, 2012 VP113, and 2013 RF98. Such clustering is fairly
obvious in terms of the values of their arguments of perihelion in
Table 1 and, even more clear, positionally in Table 2 and Fig. 1 at
about 3h in right ascension, α, and 0◦in declination, δ. The puta-
tive object responsible for inducing this clustering has been provi-
sionally denominated Planet Nine. Batygin & Brown (2016) have
provided tentative values for the orbital parameters of the proposed
10 Earth masses planet (semimajor axis, a = 700 au, eccentricity,
e = 0.6, inclination, i = 30◦, and argument of perihelion, ω = 150◦)
and discussed its possible location in the sky.1 Planet Nine as char-
acterized by Batygin & Brown (2016) is expected to exhibit a mag-
nitude V in the range 16–21 at perihelion and 20–25 at aphelion.
Detailed modelling by Linder & Mordasini (2016) gives a magni-
tude V from the reﬂected light of 23.7 at aphelion.

In principle, searching for this putative planet is feasible for
currently active moving object surveys and it is already under way.
For slow-moving objects, most active surveys can record candi-
dates brighter than V = 22 mag (see e.g. Harris & D’Abramo
2015). The faintest natural moving object observation performed
so far corresponds to V = 26.7 mag for asteroid 2008 LG2 (Micheli

et al. 2015) and the faintest objects observable with 8-m class tele-
scopes have about 27. V774104 was discovered with magnitude 24
at 103 au (Sheppard, Trujillo & Tholen 2015). Detection of mov-
ing objects not only depends on their apparent magnitude but on
their rate of motion as well (see e.g. Harris & D’Abramo 2015).
However, with an average daily motion of nearly 1 arcsec d−1 at
perihelion and almost 0.06 arcsec d−1 at aphelion, this should be a
non-issue for Planet Nine; the object’s sky motion is far too slow.
Fortunately, its shifting with respect to background stars due to par-
allax as the Earth moves around the Sun could be as high as 3 arcsec
d−1 at aphelion (V774104 was identiﬁed via parallax, not daily mo-
tion). In any case, if Planet Nine currently moves projected against
a rich stellar background (a bright section of the Milky Way galaxy
for instance) and/or its apparent magnitude is > 22 in V, its even-
tual identiﬁcation could be particularly challenging.

The Planet Nine hypothesis presents a suitable and robust sce-
nario to explain the orbital properties of six ETNOs, but it may
not be adequate to account for the apparent clustering of arguments
of perihelion around 0◦(Trujillo & Sheppard 2014) and inclination
around 20◦(de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2014) ob-
served for ETNOs with values of the semimajor axis in the range
150–250 au. A number of scenarios aimed at explaining the avail-
able observational evidence have been proposed since the discovery
of 2012 VP113 (Trujillo & Sheppard 2014). They include the possi-
ble existence of one (Trujillo & Sheppard 2014; Gomes, Soares
& Brasser 2015; Malhotra, Volk & Wang 2016) or more trans-
Plutonian planets (de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos
2014; de la Fuente Marcos, de la Fuente Marcos & Aarseth 2015),
capture of ETNOs within the Sun’s natal open star cluster (Jílková
et al. 2015), stellar encounters (Brasser & Schwamb 2015; Feng

& Bailer-Jones 2015), being a by-product of Neptune’s migration
(Brown & Firth 2016) or the inclination instability (Madigan & Mc-
Court 2016), and being the result of Milgromian dynamics (Pauˇco
& Klaˇcka 2016). In any case, trans-Plutonian planets —if they do
exist— cannot be too massive or bright (Iorio 2014; Luhman 2014;
Cowan, Holder & Kaib 2016; Fienga et al. 2016; Ginzburg, Sari
& Loeb 2016; Linder & Mordasini 2016) to have escaped detec-
tion during the last two decades of surveys and astrometric stud-
ies; masses close to or below those of Uranus or Neptune are most
likely. Trans-Plutonian planets may have been scattered out of the
region of the giant planets early in the history of the Solar system
(see e.g. Bromley & Kenyon 2014) or even captured from another
planetary system (Li & Adams 2016), but planets similar to Uranus
or Neptune (super-Earths) may also form at 125–250 au from the
Sun (Kenyon & Bromley 2015). The putative existence of trans-
Plutonian planets may have a role on models aimed at explaining
periodic mass extinctions (Whitmire 2016).

The study of the visibility of the ETNOs carried out in de la
Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos (2014) revealed an intrinsic
bias in declination induced by our observing point on Earth: the
vast majority must reach perihelion (i.e. perigee) at declinations in
the range −24◦to 24◦. Here, we study the visibility of a synthetic
population of Planet Nine virtual orbits from the Earth to uncover
possible biases that may aﬀect the detectability of such object if it
exists. This Letter is organized as follows. Section 2 is a review of
ETNOs statistics that includes a cautionary note regarding the per-
ihelia clustering identiﬁed in Batygin & Brown (2016). Our Monte
Carlo methodology is brieﬂy reviewed in Section 3. The distribu-
tion in equatorial coordinates of Planet Nine virtual orbits at aphe-
lion is studied in Section 4. Section 5 repeats the analysis for the lo-
cation of Planet Nine in Fienga et al. (2016). Results are discussed
in Section 6 and conclusions are summarized in Section 7.

2 ETNOS: CURRENT STATISTICS

In Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) the ETNOs are deﬁned as asteroids
with semimajor axis greater than 150 au and perihelion greater than
30 au. At present, there are 16 known ETNOs (see Tables 1 and 2
for relevant data). The descriptive statistics of this sample are in-
cluded in Table 1; in this table, unphysical values are displayed for
completeness. From these results it is obvious that the strongest
clustering is observed in e and i. As pointed out in de la Fuente
Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos (2014), the clustering in e can be
the result of observational bias but the one in i cannot be explained
as resulting from selection eﬀects, it must have a dynamical ori-
gin. As the one in e, the clustering in the values of the perihelion
distance may be explained as a selection eﬀect. It is also clear that
the new additions to the ETNO group since the discovery of 2012
VP113 follow the trends already identiﬁed in 2014; in particular, the
orbits of 2004 VN112 and 2013 RF98 are alike. However, we would
like to point out a potentially important issue even if the ETNO
sample is still small. In statistics, outliers are often deﬁned as ob-
servations that fall below Q1 − 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR,
where Q1 is the ﬁrst or lower quartile, Q3 is the third or upper quar-
tile, and IQR is the interquartile range or diﬀerence between the
upper and lower quartiles. In general, there are no outliers among
the ETNOs (e.g. 2003 SS422 is an outlier in terms of ω∗, see Table
1), but both (90377) Sedna and 2012 VP113 are statistical outliers in
terms of perihelion distance, q. The upper boundary for outliers in
q is 59.7 au; the values of the perihelion distance of both Sedna and
2012 VP113 are well above this upper limit. Sedna is also an outlier

in terms of orbital period. The sample is small but this fact may
be signalling a diﬀerent dynamical context for these two objects.
It is statistically possible that Sedna and 2012 VP113 are members
of a separate dynamical class within the ETNOs and therefore be
subjected to a diﬀerent set of perturbations.

The scenario in which trans-Plutonian planets keep the val-
ues of the orbital parameters of the ETNOs in check thanks to a
particular case of the Kozai mechanism (Kozai 1962) discussed in
Trujillo & Sheppard (2014), de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente
Marcos (2014) or de la Fuente Marcos et al. (2015) and the res-
onant coupling mechanism described in Batygin & Brown (2016)
create dynamical pathways that in some cases may deliver objects
to high inclination or even retrograde orbits. In principle, the mech-
anism detailed in de la Fuente Marcos et al. (2015) can also produce
objects with orbits at steeply inclined angles, it already does it for
Jupiter. On the other hand, the scenarios described in de la Fuente
Marcos et al. (2015) and Batygin & Brown (2016) are not incom-
patible, and the Kozai mechanism can operate at high eccentrici-
ties (see e.g. Naoz 2016) when the value of the relative longitude
of perihelion, ∆̟, librates about 180◦(apsidal anti-alignment). A
hypothetical Planet Nine may induce Kozai-like behaviour, i.e. li-
bration of the value of the argument of perihelion of the ETNOs
that reproduces the observed clustering. The currently known ET-
NOs probably represent evolutionary steps within dynamical tracks
and some of them are more dynamically evolved than others. The
presence of statistical outliers could be a sign of this.

3 A MONTE CARLO APPROACH

The study of the visibility of a set of orbits with parameters deﬁned
within some boundary values is a statistical problem well suited to
apply Monte Carlo techniques (Metropolis & Ulam 1949; Press et
al. 2007). A representative sample of the set of orbits under study
is systematically explored so the regions in the sky with optimal
visibility (highest probability) can be determined; in our case, the
equations of the orbits of both the Earth and Planet Nine under the
two-body approximation (e.g. Murray & Dermott 1999) are sam-
pled to ﬁnd the minimum and maximum distance between the Earth
and Planet Nine. This technique was used in de la Fuente Marcos
& de la Fuente Marcos (2014) to analyse the visibility of the ET-
NOs, and the details and further references are given there. Us-
ing a Monte Carlo approach, we generate a synthetic population of
Planet Nines with semimajor axis, a ∈ (650, 750) au, eccentricity,
e ∈ (0.55, 0.65), inclination, i ∈ (25, 35)◦, longitude of the ascend-
ing node, Ω ∈ (0, 360)◦, and argument of perihelion, ω ∈ (140,
160)◦as no explicit value of Ω is given in Batygin & Brown (2016).
We assume that the orbits of the multiple instances of Planet Nine
are uniformly distributed in orbital parameter space. Ten million
test orbits have been studied focusing on the visibility at aphelion.
The analyses in Fienga et al. (2016) and Linder & Mordasini (2016)
strongly disfavour a present-day Planet Nine located at perihelion.
The distribution in equatorial coordinates of the set of studied
orbits is presented in Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure, the value of the parameter
in the appropriate units is colour coded following the scale printed
on the associated colour box. In panel D (inclination), the loca-
tions of the Galactic disc and centre are indicated. The background
stellar density is the highest towards these regions in the sky. The
distribution of aphelion distances, semimajor axes and eccentrici-
ties is rather uniform. The distribution in inclination and argument
of perihelion depends on the declination; those orbits with higher
values of the inclination reach aphelion at lower declinations, the

same behaviour is observed for the ones with lower values of the
argument of perihelion. The distribution in longitude of the ascend-
ing node depends on the right ascension; orbits with Ω ∼0◦reach
aphelion at α ∼23h, the ones with Ω ∼ 90◦at α ∼5h, and those with

MNRAS 000, 1–6 (2016)

Ω ∼270◦reach aphelion at α ∼17h. In any case, orbits reach perihe-
lion at declination in the range −20◦to 50◦(not shown) and aphelion
in the range −50◦to 20◦. This is markedly diﬀerent from the bias
found for the ETNOs in de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Mar-
cos (2014); i.e. searching for Planet Nine is not expected to increase
the discovery rate of ETNOs and searching for ETNOs is not going
to make a direct detection of Planet Nine more likely (indirectly
yes, by improving the values of its putative orbital elements).

4 PLANET NINE AT APHELION

Detection of Planet Nine would be much easier if it is close to peri-
helion at present, but the analysis of Cassini radio ranging data car-
ried out in Fienga et al. (2016) strongly suggests that Planet Nine as
characterized by Batygin & Brown (2016) cannot be at perihelion.
This conclusion is consistent with the analysis of its expected pho-
tometric properties in e.g. Linder & Mordasini (2016). A location
in or near aphelion is however compatible with both the analysis of
planetary ephemerides and the outcome of the many surveys com-
pleted in recent years. If Planet Nine is currently near aphelion, its
declination will be in the range −50◦to 20◦(see Fig. 1), but not all
the values of δ are equally probable. Figure 2 shows that the distri-
bution is somewhat uniform in right ascension, but the probability
of ﬁnding an orbit reaching aphelion at declinations in the ranges
(−40, −30)◦and (0, 10)◦is nearly 1.7 times higher than that of do-
ing it in the range (−30, 0)◦. The eﬀect of the bias in declination is
analysed in more detail in Fig. 3. Locations near the Galactic Cen-
tre are possible if Ω ∼ 300◦; the Galactic Centre is approximately

sion, top panel, and declination, bottom panel) of the studied virtual orbits
at aphelion. The distribution is somewhat uniform in right ascension and
shows two maxima for declinations in the ranges (−40, −30)◦and (0, 10)◦.
In this and subsequent ﬁgures, the number of bins is 2 n1/3, where n is the
number of virtual orbits plotted, error bars are too small to be seen. The
black circles correspond to objects in Table 2.

5 CASSINI HINTS: FIENGA ET AL. (2016)

Fienga et al. (2016) have carried out an analysis of Cassini ra-
dio ranging data. Their extrapolation of the Cassini data indicates
that Planet Nine as characterised by Batygin & Brown (2016) can-
not exist in the interval of true anomaly (−132, 106.5)◦. This au-
tomatically excludes the perihelion (see their ﬁg. 6). The aphe-
lion is included in the uncertainty zone where the Cassini data do
not provide any constraints, i.e. the residuals are compatible with
zero. Fienga et al. (2016) indicate that from the point of view of
the Cassini residuals, the most probable position of Planet Nine
—assuming a value of Ω = 113◦— is at true anomaly equal to
117.8◦ +11◦
−10◦. An analysis similar to that in Section 3 gives Fig. 4; this
prediction places Planet Nine at α ∼ 2h and δ ∼ −20◦, in Cetus.

6 DISCUSSION

The Planet Nine hypothesis represents an exciting opportunity to
survey the outskirts of the Solar system with a purpose and im-
prove our current knowledge of that distant region as well as of
testing the correctness of models and long-standing assumptions.
Our visibility analyses provide clues on the most probable location
of the putative planet given a set of assumed orbital parameters
based on the published data. The aphelion conﬁguration gives two
preferred present locations with nearly the same degree of proba-
bility and two others with lower probability. If any of the assumed
parameters is grossly in error, the preferred locations computed via
Monte Carlo would be diﬀerent but perhaps not too far from the
values discussed here. Less probable locations are mostly close to
the regions where ETNOs have already been found and the lack of
detections there suggests that their lower values of the probability
are conﬁrmed by the available observational data. Figure 1 shows
that for ﬁnding ETNOs, the region enclosed between galactic lati-
tude −30◦and 30◦has been so far carefully avoided. In general, this
cannot be the case for any serious search for Planet Nine.

7 CONCLUSIONS

In this Letter, we have explored the visibility of Planet Nine. This
study has been performed using Monte Carlo techniques. In addi-

at α ∼ 17.h7 and δ ∼ −29◦. A more exhaustive analysis shows
that if δ ∈ (5, 7)◦ then Ω ∈ (145, 155)◦ and α ∈ (8, 9)h, which
is located in Hydra and away from the main bulk of the Milky
Way. Unfortunately, another optimal solution is possible —albeit
slightly less probable— if δ ∈ (−35, −33)◦ then Ω ∈ (265, 275)◦
and α ∈ (15.5, 16.5)h, which is located towards the Galactic bulge
between the constellations of Scorpius and Lupus, but relatively far
from the Galactic Centre. These two areas are associated with val-
ues of Ω that give ∆̟ equal to 180◦(Ω = 150◦) and 60◦(Ω = 270◦),
respectively. This second value is inconsistent with the pseudo res-
onant scenario described in Batygin & Brown (2016). Figures 2
and 3 show that two other solutions are possible but less prob-
able. One with δ ∈ (5, 7)◦, Ω ∼ 100◦and α ∈ (3.5, 4.5)h —in
Taurus— and the second one with δ ∈ (-35,-33)◦, Ω ∼ 310◦and
α ∈ (20, 21)h —between Microscopium and Sagittarius. The solu-
tion with Ω ∼ 100◦is favoured by Batygin and Brown (2016; see
footnote 1) and subsequently by Fienga et al. (2016). Such solution
gives a value of ∆̟ ∼ 200◦which is also consistent with apsidal
anti-alignment.

tion, the descriptive statistics of the sample of known ETNOs has
been re-examined. Our conclusions can be summarized as follows.

• Observing from the Earth, Planet Nine would reach perihelion
at declination in the range −20◦to 50◦and aphelion in the range
−50◦to 20◦.

• If Planet Nine is at aphelion, it is most likely moving within
α ∈ (8, 9)h and δ ∈ (5, 7)◦. Another solution, α ∈ (3.5, 4.5)h and
δ ∈ (5, 7)◦, is less probable. Both locations are compatible with an
apsidal anti-alignment scenario.

• If Planet Nine is at the location favoured in Fienga et al.

(2016), it could be found at α ∼ 2h and δ ∼ −20◦.

• The orbits of known ETNOs exhibit robust clustering in incli-

nation at i = 20 ± 8◦that cannot be explained by selection eﬀects.

• Considering the sample of known ETNOs, (90377) Sedna and
2012 VP113 are clear statistical outliers in terms of perihelion dis-
tance. This may indicate that these two objects form a separate dy-
namical class within the known ETNOs.
