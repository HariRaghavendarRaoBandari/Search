Abstract

In the single-scattering theory of electromagnetic radiation, the fractal regime is a deﬁnite range in the
photon momentum-transfer q, which is characterized by the scaling-law behavior of the structure factor:
S(q) ∝ 1/qdf . This allows a straightforward estimation of the fractal dimension df of aggregates in Small-
Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments. However, this behavior is not commonly studied in optical
scattering experiments because of the lack of information on its domain of validity. In the present work,
we propose a deﬁnition of the multiple-scattering structure factor, which naturally generalizes the single-
scattering function S(q). We show that the mean-ﬁeld theory of electromagnetic scattering provides an
explicit condition to interpret the signiﬁcance of multiple scattering. In this paper, we investigate and discuss
electromagnetic scattering by three classes of fractal aggregates. The results obtained from the TMatrix
method show that the fractal scaling range is divided into two domains: 1) a genuine fractal regime, which
is robust; 2) a possible anomalous scaling regime, S(q) ∝ 1/qδ, with exponent δ independent of df , and
related to the way the scattering mechanism uses the local morphology of the scatterer. The recognition,
and an analysis, of the latter domain is of importance because it may result in signiﬁcant reduction of the
fractal regime, and brings into question the proper mechanism in the build-up of multiple-scattering.

1. Introduction

The investigation of the optical response of dis-
ordered matter is an intricate problem. The most
common tools to extract information from the scat-
tering data are the trial-and-error methods. How-
ever, due to a large number of relevant parameters,
the results are tedious to obtain and may prove to
be ambiguous. For this reason, direct methods al-
lowing computation of system parameters from the
scattering data are highly desirable.

In the single-scattering case, a few direct meth-
ods are known. For example, the fractal dimension
of a ﬁnite aggregate of particles is given by a spe-

cial scaling law of the structure factor, S(q), in the
fractal regime [1]:

S(q) ∝ (qa)−df .

(1)

Here, q = |q| is the magnitude of the momen-
tum transfer, a is the typical microscopic particle
size, and df is the fractal dimension of the aggre-
gate. This fractal scaling law is valid in the range
1/Rg < q < 1/a, where Rg is the mean radius
of gyration. The above relation in q-space reﬂects
the corresponding scaling law of the pair-correlation
function, g(r), in real space [1]:

g(r) ∝ r df −3,

(2)

valid in the range a < r < Rg.

From the introduction of X-ray generators a cen-
tury ago [2] to the present synchrotron facilities [3],
the structure factor has turned out to be a major
tool to characterize correlations between the parti-
cle positions over many length scales [4]. The re-
lation (1) is widely used in small-angle X-ray scat-
tering (SAXS) [2] to study the morphology of frac-
tal aggregates [5] or fractal surfaces [6]. We can
also obtain the speciﬁc surface of the system from
the Porod regime [7], and the mean gyration radius
from the Guinier regime [8].

On the other hand, most light-scattering exper-
iments involve multiple-scattering processes, which
are intractable using simple mathematical tools.
However, previous studies have shown that Eq. (1)
may remain valid for scattering measurements even
though multiple-scattering events are suspected to
be present [9, 10]. Experimentalists widely use the
above single-scattering scaling law for the charac-
terization of various fractal aggregates [11], though
they also claim that minor diﬀerences exist between
the experimental data and the transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the fractal di-
mension. Other results suggest that Eq. (1) might
not be valid when multiple-scattering is present. A
theoretical argument due to Berry and Percival [12]
claims that the scaling relation in Eq. (1) should fail
for aggregates with mass-fractal dimension df > 2.
However, it is not clear what relation should replace
Eq. (1) in that case. Results of numerical compu-
tations [13, 14] suggest that Eq. (1) is valid for the
case of df > 2, but with an eﬀective exponent dif-
ferent from the fractal dimension.

In this paper, we present detailed theoretical and
numerical results to clarify this important issue.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
introduce the static structure factor with multiple-
scattering condition. Section 3 describes the mean-
ﬁeld multiple-scattering theory for the dipolar and
multipolar regimes. In Section 4, we compare the-
oretical and numerical results for three diﬀerent
types of cluster aggregates. In Section 5, we dis-
cuss the scaling behavior of the structure factor.
Finally, we conclude with a summary in Section 6.

2. General Deﬁnition of the Static Structure

Factor

Consider a monochromatic electromagnetic wave
of amplitude E0 and wavelength λ,
illuminating
an aggregate of N spherical particles of radius a.

2

We assume elastic light-scattering, with the wave-
vector kinc (of modulus k = 2π/λ) deﬁning the
propagation direction of the incident beam. The
scattered wave-vector, ksca (with the same modu-
lus k), deﬁnes the observation direction. For the
general case of a randomly-oriented aggregate, the
intensity IN (q) of the scattered wave depends on
qa, where q is the magnitude of the scattering vec-
tor q = kinc − ksca.
Assuming separation of the optical properties
and the spatial distribution of the particles, IN (q)
is related to the structure factor SN (q) as

IN (q) = |E0|2f (N )F (q)SN (q) ,

(3)

the form factor F (q) being the intensity scattered
by a single particle.

We make the following observations:

1) The structure factor SN (q) is a positive function
which can be conveniently normalized such that
SN (0) = 1. This function contains information
about the spatial distribution of the particles. For
the case of a single particle (i.e., N = 1), S1(q) = 1.
2) The scaling factor f (N ) is related to the forward-
scattering scaling as

f (N ) =

IN (0)

|E0|2F (0)

.

(4)

In most cases, this function behaves as a power-law:
f (N ) ∝ N α, with an exponent 0 < α ≤ 2 [5].
The simplest way to deﬁne the structure factor
is then via the normalized ratio of the scattered in-
tensity from the N particles (IN ) and the scattered
intensity from a single particle (I1):

SN (q) =

IN (q)
IN (0) ·

I1(0)
I1(q)

.

(5)

Now, IN being written as the product of a func-
tion of the optical parameters and a function
involving the spatial distribution of the particles,
the deﬁnition (5) results in a quantity which
depends essentially on the mass distribution of the
aggregate.

The Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (RDG) theory pro-
vides a framework in which the separation between
the optical and geometrical properties is realized
[15].
Indeed, the RDG theory tells us that the
single-scattering of the incoming wave by a collec-
tion of N electromagnetic dipoles is the dominant
process due to the weak electric polarizability of the
particles inside the aggregate. The structure factor

in Eq. (5) is then written as the square modulus of
the Fourier transform of the density distribution of
the scattering system [4]:

In Eq. (6), rj denotes the position of the jth
particle in the aggregate.
In Eq. (7), g(r) is the
pair-correlation function [1], and ρ = N/V is the
particle number density in a given volume V .

For a fractal scatterer of radius of gyration Rg,
which is an aggregate of spherical particles of radius
a, the main features of the RDG structure factor are
as follows
1) qa < a/Rg is the Guinier regime [8], which de-
pends only on the parameter qRg.
2) a/Rg < qa < 1 is the fractal regime, which is
characterized by Eq. (1). We focus on this regime
in the next section.
3) 1 ≪ qa is the Porod regime [7], which is not
relevant for the present paper.

approximation and the
complicated multiple-
scattering computations. In this context, the mean-
ﬁeld multiple-scattering approximation provides a
mathematically tractable method, which includes
the main features of the scattering problem. In this
approximation, all the particles of the aggregate
are expected to radiate the same electromagnetic
ﬁeld, diﬀering only in the phase [12]. However, the
mean-ﬁeld approach is not consistent with localiza-
tion phenomena such as coherent scattering [16].

3.1. The Dipolar Theory

Let us consider an aggregate made up of particles
of radius a and complex refractive index n. The
optical size parameter of the aggregate is x = ka =
2πa/λ. Then, the dipolar regime corresponds to
[17]

|n|x < 1.

(8)
In this regime, the multiple-scattering ﬁeld is simi-
lar to the single-scattering ﬁeld with the renormal-
ized amplitude [12]

From Eq. (9), the precise condition for the single-

scattering approximation to be valid is written as

Eq. (7) remains valid in the mean-ﬁeld dipolar
multiple-scattering approximation.

(N − 1)|χ(x)A(kRg)| ≪ 1.

(12)

Otherwise, the renormalized coeﬃcient has to be
accounted for in the scattering formulae. As the
coeﬃcient (N − 1)χA in Eq. (9) does not depend
upon q, we deduce an important consequence, i.e.,

3.2. The Multipolar Theory

The mean-ﬁeld scattering theory in the multi-
polar case [18] is comparatively more complicated
than the dipolar case. It gives two diﬀerent factors

3

to renormalize the coeﬃcients in the expansion of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in terms of the spherical
vector wave functions. Consequently, it is natural
to question the validity of the simple Eq. (7) in this
case.

Actually, the structure factor can be written in

this case as (see Eq. (25) of Ref. [18])

where I1 is the intensity of the wave scattered by
an isolated sphere, and I ⋆
1 is the corresponding
intensity with the renormalized multipolar coeﬃ-
cients. Then, SN (q) consists of the RDG structure
factor (6) corrected by a (possibly complicated)
function of q. Thus, the fractal scaling relation (1)
is not guaranteed to work in this framework.

It is shown in Ref. [12] that the left-hand term
of the condition in Eq. (12) tends to a constant
≃ (n2 − 1)(ka)3−df (independent of the aggregate
size) when df < 2, i.e., fractal dimensions corre-
sponding to very ﬂuﬀy aggregates. If this constant
is small enough, single-scattering is the dominant
process regardless of the cluster size. On the other
hand, when df > 2 corresponding to dense aggre-
gates, the left-hand term ≃ (ka)N 1−2/df . Thus,
there is a typical cluster size beyond which multiple-
scattering cannot be neglected for df > 2.

4. Manifestation of Scaling Laws in the
Structure Factors of DLCA and DLA
Clusters

In this section, we study the structure factors of
two classes of fractal aggregates of spheres, viz.,
Diﬀusion-Limited Cluster Aggregates or DLCA [19]
with fractal dimension df = 1.78; and Diﬀusion-
Limited Aggregates or DLA [20] with df = 2.5. For
numerical computation, we use the multiple scatter-
ing code TMatrix [21, 22], which takes into account
the multipolar terms of the scattered wave.

4.1. The DLCA Model: An Example with df < 2

Fig. 1(a)-(c) shows TMatrix scattering data [S(q)
q on a log-log plot] obtained for the DLCA
vs.
model. The data is angularly averaged over 20 in-
dependent random oﬀ-lattice DLCA aggregates of
N = 384 spherical particles. We considered three
diﬀerent values of the optical size parameter: (a)

x = 0.1; (b) x = 0.5; (c) x = 1.0, corresponding to
wavelengths respectively larger than, of the same
order, and smaller than the aggregate gyration ra-
dius Rg. Moreover, three diﬀerent values of the
refractive index (n = 1.05, 1.5, 3.0) were used.

Structure factors obtained from multiple-

clusters. These are compared with the single-scattering re-
sult or SiS in Eq. (6), denoted by a solid line. Three sets
of the optical size parameter are used:
(a) x = 0.1; (b)
x = 0.5; and (c) x = 1.0. In these log-log plots, a line of
slope −df (with df = 1.78) is shown for comparison in the
range a/Rg < qa < 1.

One can check the validity of the mean-ﬁeld ap-
proximation by direct comparison with the exact
TMatrix results. For this, we analyze the proba-
bility distributions of the particle scattering cross-
sections Qsca(j), for all the particles in an aggre-
gate (the index j representing the sphere label).
These distributions are shown in Fig. 2 for both
DLCAs and DLAs- the latter will be discussed in
Sec. 4.2. The main conclusions are as follows. In all
the cases, except for the largest optical size param-
eter and largest refractive index (x = 1.0, n = 3.0),
the mean values hQscai agree well with the domi-
nant modes Qm. Thus, the mean-ﬁeld approach is
valid in those cases. This is also consistent with
the small values of the quantity (N − 1)|χA| (see
Table 1), which arises in Eq. (12). For the case
(x = 1.0, n = 3.0), the mean-ﬁeld assumption is

4

not valid, as is clear from the wide distribution of
the individual Qsca, and the relatively high value
(≃ 0.8) of (N − 1)|χA|.

The structure factors for the DLA cluster are
shown in Fig. 3. One can draw the following con-
clusions, which will be discussed in greater detail in
Sec. 5.

1) For x = 0.1 [Fig. 3(a)], dipolar single-
scattering is the relevant process, in agreement with
Table 2. The TMatrix structure factor is numer-
ically indistinguishable from the single-scattering
S(q) calculated using Eq. (6) and plotted on the ﬁg-
ure as the solid line. Note that the fractal regime
is not easily accessible in these numerical experi-
ments, due to the natural limitation in the range of
the q-values (the maximum value of qa is 2x, real-
ized in the backward scattering direction).
2) For x = 0.5 [Fig. 3(b)], dipolar single-scattering
is valid for the weak scattering cases with n = 1.05
(comparison can be done with the solid line or with
the corresponding single-scattering DLA structure
factor as reproduced in [13, 14]). Hence, an ex-
cellent agreement between the TMatrix results and
the single-scattering data is observed. However, the
fractal scaling law in Eq. (1), which should appear

Figure 2: Probability distribution functions P (Qsca) of the
individual scattered eﬃciencies Qsca(j) of the spheres inside
DLA and DLCA aggregates of N = 384 particles. Data are
shown for two diﬀerent values of the optical parameter x =
ka and of the real refractive index n: (a) x = 0.5, n = 1.5; (b)
x = 0.5, n = 3.0; (c) x = 1.0, n = 1.5; and (d) x = 1.0, n =
3.0. The widths of P (Qsca) are signiﬁcantly smaller than
their modes for all the cases except for (x = 1.0 , n = 3.0).
The values of the mean and the mode (hQscai , Qm) are as
follows: (a) (0.02 , 0.02); (b) (0.22 , 0.16); (c) (0.23 , 0.19);
(d) (2.8 , 0.2) for the most probable mode, and (2.8 , 3.4) for
the secondary mode. The distributions in (a)-(c) are clearly
unimodal.

In Fig.1(a)-(c), we recover the fractal scaling law
(1) in all cases except for (x = 1.0, n = 3.0), on the
expected range of values of qa, viz., 0.04 < qa < 1
(for Rg ≃ 25.4a, here). As the single-scattering pro-
cess is dominant here, the results are in accordance
with [10, 23].

On the other hand, the failure of the fractal scal-
ing law for (x = 1.0, n = 3.0) can be explained
by both the high value of (N − 1)|χA| (relevance
of multiple scattering) and the high value of |n|x
(multipolar theory applies). We shall discuss this
case in greater detail in Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 5.

4.2. The DLA Model: An Example with df > 2

Next, we consider the DLA model for which
df ≃ 2.5. The computations described in Sec. 4.1
have been repeated for random oﬀ-lattice DLA ag-
gregates (with N = 384 particles). We averaged

of slope −1.7 (see text) is drawn on the range a/Rg < qa < 1.

in the range 0.07 < qa < 1 is hardly seen. The
case n = 1.5 is also in agreement with the single-
scattering result, but through the explanation given
in Section 3.1 as the dipolar mean-ﬁeld multiple
scattering case holds (see Table 2 and Fig. 1(a)).
3) For x = 0.5, when qa > 0.2, one can note that
a power-law behavior: S(q) ∝ (qa)−δ appears with
an anomalous exponent δ ≃ 1.7, substantially dif-
ferent from the fractal dimension df = 2.5. This
behavior was recently discussed in detail by Oh and
Sorensen [13] and Katyal et al.
[14]. We conclude
that it is a robust feature, which is not limited to
the dipolar single-scattering case. Since the scal-
ing behavior is seen in both single-scattering and
multiple-scattering conditions, this is a signature of
the local arrangement of the particles in the DLA
clusters.
4) For the parameters (x = 0.5, n = 3.0), we ex-
pect relevant multipolar mean-ﬁeld multiple scat-
tering (see Table 2 and Fig. 1(b)). However, the
major features of S(q) are similar to the case
(x = 0.5, n = 1.5), though appearing at system-
atically smaller values of q,
i.e., for larger char-
acteristic lengths.
In other words, extracting the
value of the gyration radius from the Guinier regime
[S(q) ∼ exp(−q2R2
g/3)] would result in an over-

6

estimation by some 50% of its correct value. The
anomalous power-law: S(q) ∝ (qa)−δ appears again
in this case with the same exponent δ ≃ 1.7 as for
the above case.
5) For x = 1.0 [Fig. 3(c)], the change with in-
creasing refractive index, n is similar to the case
x = 0.5, but occurs at smaller values of n. The
case (x = 1.0, n = 1.05) is comparable to the
single-scattering result, though it exhibits a shorter
Guinier regime. The case (x = 1.0, n = 1.5) em-
phasizes the appearance of an anomalous power-law
for S(q).
6) The behavior arising for (x = 1.0, n = 3.0) is
completely diﬀerent. Here, the mean-ﬁeld approxi-
mation is no longer valid (see Table 2 and Fig. 1(d)).
In that case, one can see strong scattering in both
the forward and the backward directions (small and
large values of q), which destroys the possible scal-
ing law for S(q).

5. Scaling Behavior of the Structure Factor:

Further Discussion

The TMatrix data analyzed in Section 4 shows
diﬀerent scenarios for scattering aggregates with
fractal dimension df < 2 and df > 2. This is in
agreement with a qualitative argument by Berry
and Percival [12] who stated that the electromag-
netic scattering features must diﬀer essentially in
these cases. This statement holds true whether the
geometric projection of the aggregate on the plane
perpendicular to the incident wave direction is com-
pact (df > 2), or still a fractal (df < 2).

The case df < 2 exhibits rather simple behavior.
The scaling relation of the generalized structure fac-
tor, S(q) ∼ (qa)−df , is valid in the fractal regime
(a/Rg < qa < 1) for moderate multiple-scattering
[(N − 1)|χA| < 0.45] and moderate multipolar fea-
ture (|n|x < 1.5). This conﬁrms the common belief
regarding the robustness of the fractal scaling law
for df < 2. However, in the most extreme case that
we studied, i.e., (x = 1.0, n = 3.0), the backscatter-
ing signal is strongly enhanced. This is related to
coherent backscattering of a random system made
of small particles [24], resulting in weak localiza-
tion of the wave in the backward direction. This
phenomenon leads to a backscattering cone of en-
hanced intensity, in particular for fractal aggregates
[25], as seen in Fig. 1(c), and to a smaller extent in
Fig. 1(b) (n = 3.0). As it corresponds to a local-
ization event, coherent backscattering is not part of

the mean-ﬁeld theory developed in [12, 18], thus it
is not taken into account in the condition (12).

For df < 2, we conclude that the structure fac-
tor can be fully explained with the help of the
Guinier regime, the fractal regime, and the coherent
backscattering feature. In particular, the fractal di-
mension can be safely extracted from the relation
(1), even if multiple-scattering components are not
small.

We have emphazised the robustness of the power
law exponent −df in the S(q) vs. q plot for df < 2.
The next question that arises is related to the sen-
sitivity of the fractal domain to a possible enlarge-
ment of the backscattering regime.
In fact, the
backscattering cone angle increases with the mean
free length of the wave scattering in the system
[24]. Thus, the largest backscattering cones are
expected to occur for the smallest fractal dimen-
sions, for which the particles forming the aggregate
are far apart. Therefore, we performed TMatrix
calculations for a linear chain (df = 1) of spher-
ical particles with an angular averaging, for the
same parameters as used previously. The results
are shown in Fig. 4, and should be compared with
the exact result of the single-scattering case, which
is S(q) ∼ π/(2N qa) for the large aggregates of size
N and N qa > √3.
Indeed, multiple scattering is expected to be ir-
relevant in this case because of the low density
of the aggregate, or equivalently the small values
of (N − 1)|χA|, which are about 3 times smaller
than the values for the DLCA aggregates. How-
ever, the results plotted in Fig. 4 show a discrep-
ancy between the single-scattering result (which is
a straight line of slope −1 on the ﬁgures) and the
multiple-scattering results - coherent backscatter-
ing leads to an enhanced scattering signal upto
qa ∼ 0.1, hiding the fractal regime. Interestingly,
the behavior for qa > 0.1 can be well represented
as an anomalous power-law scaling: S(q) ∼ (qa)−δ
with an exponent δ ≃ 1.7. We should emphasize
here that this feature is due to the coherent scat-
tering, because it is neither due to special morphol-
ogy of the aggregate (the anomalous scaling law is
not seen in the single-scattering data) nor due to
the ordinary multiple-scattering process (because
of the small values of (N − 1)|χA|).
We now have the tools to analyze the seem-
ingly more complicated case df > 2 (shown in
Fig. 3). For small values of the optical size pa-
rameter (x = 0.1), the multiple-scattering process
is irrelevant due to the small values of (N − 1)|χA|

7

(see Table 2). Therefore, the S(q) behavior is the
same as for the single-scattering case. The Guinier
regime is dominant because of the small size of the
aggregate. For x = 0.5, one should also recover
the single-scattering structure factor because of the
small values of (N − 1)|χA|. This is indeed the
case while comparing Fig. 3(b) and the correspond-
ing single-scattering ﬁgures in [13, 14]. The un-
expected power-law scaling S(q) ∼ (qa)−δ with the
exponent δ ≃ 1.7, as seen for 0.2 < qa < 1, is due to
the local morphology of the aggregates, since this
is a feature of the single-scattering pattern (thus
of the Fourier transform of the correlation function
g(r)). Because of the slope −1.7 being similar to
the DLCA fractal slope, it is conjectured that a
DLCA-like local arrangement of particles is present
inside the DLA clusters [13]. This can be checked
directly for the small-r behavior of the correlation
function g(r) [26].

The present scattering data also strengthens the
above conclusion, though the precise value of the
slope may be diﬃcult to estimate. For example, the
same exponent δ has been estimated to be 1.2 (in-
stead of 1.7) for composite clusters made of DLCA
(df = 1.8) at short length-scales [27], and DLA
(df = 2.5) at long length-scales (with parameters
x = 0.354, n = 1.4607, N = 4275 and using the
DDA code [28]). The latter case is comparable
to our (x = 0.5, n = 1.5) case. As explained in
Ref. [13], the hump seen for qRg ≃ 1 is due to a
misﬁt between the Guinier regime for the small val-
ues of q [S(q) ∼ exp(−4(qa)2N 2/2.5/3)] which uses
the fractal dimension 2.5 to obtain the overall gy-
ration radius. Also, the DLCA-like fractal regime
[S(q) ∼ 1/(N (qa)1.78)] uses the fractal dimension
1.78 for the large q. This hump in the structure
factor results in a kind of corona as appearing for
a porous sphere of fractal dimension df = 3 with a
high refractive index [29]. The general appearance
of the hump for the DLA clusters provides another
proof that the Guiner and fractal regimes are robust
against moderate multiple-scattering processes.

To summarize, one can note two special behav-

iors for larger values of x|n|, as described below.
1) For (x = 0.5, n = 3), our data is consistent with
the fractal dimension −2.5, followed by an anoma-
lous scaling law (slope −1.7). The same behav-
ior occurs for the case (x = 1, n = 1.5) (which
yields the same value of x|n|). The cause of this ef-
fect is probably due to the multiple scattering pro-
cess as evident from the relatively large value of
(N − 1)|χA| ≃ 0.6. However, further investigation

is required to understand its origin and behavior.
In this particular example, we can also see the on-
set of coherent backscattering.
2) For the x = 1 case, the most striking feature
is the coherent backscattering enhancement devel-
oping for the largest values of the refractive index,
for both the DLA [Fig. 1(c)] and DLCA [Fig. 3(c)]
cases.

6. Conclusion

We have analyzed TMatrix scattering results for
three diﬀerent classes of fractal aggregates (the lin-
ear chain, the DLCA and DLA clusters) for various
optical size parameters and refractive index in the
domain of common applications. We conclude that
the fractal regime, allowing for direct estimation
of the fractal dimension, is robust against moder-
ate multiple scattering. However, its range (in the
q-values) can be signiﬁcantly reduced either by a
speciﬁc local arrangement of the particles inside the
scatterer (DLA case) or by a coherent backscatter-
ing process (for small fractal dimensions).

We provide an explicit criterion to check whether
a scattering experiment is in the single or multiple-
scattering regime. We emphasize that the criterion

8

is valid only in the fractal regime, and not in the
forward or backward scattering directions. Thus,
we now have a tool to extract the fractal dimension
in a controlled way from the scattering data in the
fractal regime.
