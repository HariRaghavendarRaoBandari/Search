Single-photon avalanche photodiode(SPAD) has been widely used in researching of quantum op-
tics. Afterpulsing eﬀect, which is an intrinsic character of SPAD, aﬀects the system performance
in most of the experiments and needs to be carefully handled. For a long time, afterpulsing has
been presumed to be determined by the pre-ignition avalanche. We studied the afterpulsing eﬀect
of a commercial InGaAs/InP SPAD (APD: Princeton Lightwave PGA-300) and demonstrated that
its afterpulsing is non-Markov, which has memory eﬀect of the avalanching history. Theoretical
analysis and the experimental results clearly indicate that the embodiment of this memory eﬀect
is the afterpulsing probability, which increases as the number of ignition-avalanche pulses increase.
The conclusion makes the principle of afterpulsing eﬀect clearer and is instructive to the manufac-
turing processes and afterpulsing evaluation of high-count-rate SPADs. It can also be regarded as
an fundamental premise to handle the afterpulsing signals in many applications, such as quantum
communication and quantum random number generator.

INTRODUCTION

Avalanche photodiode (APD) is widely used in broad ﬁelds, such as single molecule detection [1, 2], autocorrelated
ﬂuorescent decays and quantum information [3, 4], to detect extremely weak light signals or even single photons. The
latter is usually named single-photon avalanche detector (SPAD), which acts as an essential device and may greatly
inﬂuence the performance of the system in many applications, especially in quantum information ﬁelds [4, 5]. SPADs
usually works in two diﬀerent modes:free-running mode and gated mode. For free-running mode, the SPAD is biased
above its breakdown voltage to allow an avalanche happens. For gated mode, the SPAD is commonly biased below
its breakdown voltage and avalanche process can only happen in gating time windows when additional gate voltage
signals are superimposed. There are many parameters can be used to quantify the performance of SPADs, such as
clocking rate, dark count rate, detection eﬃciency, timing jitter and so on. In the past decade, the performance of
SPAD has been greatly improved and can working at gigahertz clocking frequency with up to one hundred megahertz
counting rates[6–8].

However, afterpulsing eﬀect of SPAD severely limits the count rate and applications in precise measurements.
Afterpulsing, which is correlated with the ignition avalanche, comes from detrapping of carriers that were trapped by
deep energy level in the junction depletion layer [9–12]. The trapped carriers then release from the traps over time by
thermal ﬂuctuation. Usually, the release lifetime τ is dependent on the type of traps and can vary from 10 ns to several
microseconds [10, 13, 14], which is usually much longer than that needed for quenching an avalanche. A releasing
carrier may initiate another pseudo detection signal, which is usually called afterpulsing or after pulse, if the SPAD is
biased above the breakdown voltage. The pseudo signal leads to negative eﬀects on SPADs’ applications. For example,
afterpulsing will increase quantum bit error rate in quantum key distribution [15, 16] and destruct the randomness
of quantum random number generator[17]. In order to reduce afterpulsing, another hold-oﬀ time depending on τ is
necessary. The afterpulsing eﬀect is negligible if the hold-oﬀ time is much longer than carriers’ lifetime τ . But it is not
practical for high-count-rate SPADs. Many approaches have been proposed to reduce afterpulsing [4, 6, 11, 18–20],
but it remains a critical limitation for high-count-rate SPADs. Precisely modeling the behavior of afterpulsing is the
foundation to handle this problem.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF AFTERPULSING EFFECT

The trap lifetime τ of APD can be described by the Arrhenius equation

τ = CeEa/kT

2

(1)

where T is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant and C is determined by the relevant eﬀective states density,
cross section of the trap and temperature T [14]. The carriers releasing probability is then exponential via time t.
As the types of traps in APD are dependent on practical manufacturing processes, there are thereby variety of traps
with diﬀerent lifetime τj . Thus, the afterpulsing probability (AP) during a detection window ∆t contains diﬀerent
exponential components [10]

pa(j) = A1exp(−

j · ∆t

τ1

) + A2exp(−

j · ∆t

τ2

) + · · · .

(2)

where Ai are amplitudes of diﬀerent exponential components. and pa(j) means the AP of the j-th detection window
after the ignition avalanche. Recently, diﬀerent ﬁtting methods have been studied, which employed a broad distribution
of diﬀerent exponential components instead of summating a few dominate discrete ones [21, 22].

So far, most studies on afterpulsing eﬀect just focus on its time-dependent probability distribution ignited by a
single light pulse, and do not discriminate the situation with single ignition avalanche from that with multiple ones
[12, 23–26]. However, it is not the real situation when the SPAD works continuously for photon detection. In this case,
several avalanches may happen successively within the lifetimes of trapped carriers. Previous works have demonstrated
that traps ﬁlled with carriers during an avalanche event are much smaller than the total number of traps [10, 14, 27].
Thus, avalanches happen successively will increase the number of ﬁlled traps and hence will enhance the AP. That is,
the AP distribution may be correlated to the avalanching history, while prior studies have not delve down into this
physical procedure.

In this paper, we studied the afterpulsing inﬂuence of multi-ignition avalanches on photon detection process of
InGaAs/InP SPAD under diﬀerent gate frequencies and photon intensities and found out that afterpulsing possesses
memory eﬀect and thus correlates to the avalanching history. We call this property as non-Markov property [28, 29].
We gave out analytical expressions of afterpulsing inﬂuences on photon detection in theory. The afterpulsing inﬂuence
on photon detection can then be quantiﬁed. We also demonstrated experiments to verify the theory on afterpulsing
eﬀect. The experimental results ﬁtted well with the theoretical model. The model is instructive to the manufacturing
processes and afterpulsing evaluation of high-count-rate SPADs. It also oﬀers a new perspective to deal with practical
security of quantum communication with imperfect devices [30–32].

A. Markovian Model

Considering that trap level distribution is a technological parameter, which is determined once the product is
fabricated and the details have been studied well, we do not deal with speciﬁc time-dependent distribution of AP in
the next analysis process. The primary data of pa can be obtained by experimental measurements. In addition, It is
reasonable to assume that the ﬁlling and release processes of diﬀerent traps are independent as the ﬁlling is rare.

We model the procedure according to Markovian and Non-Markov procedure individually. Firstly, we assume that
AP distribution is only determined by the latest ignition avalanche as assumed in [33],namely, the AP distribution has
no memory of prior avalanching history and is Markovian. The probability of an avalanche triggered by laser pulse
and dark count can be derived from the Poisson distribution and avalanche probabilities of diﬀerent gates (detection
windows) are independent identical distribution (IID) [17]. Let p be the avalanche probability per gate triggered by
photon pulse, pa(j) be the AP of Gate-j with single-ignition photon pulse and pn be the total avalanche probability
of Gate-n. There is no afterpulsing for the ﬁrst gate. As we assume that afterpulsing eﬀect comes from the latest
ignition avalanche only, the system should have no memory of avalanching history before that. That is, if Gate-(n − 1)
avalanches, p(n|n− 1) = p+ (1 − p)pa(1). If Gate-(n− 1) does not avalanche, Gate-(n− 2) is considered. If Gate-(n− 2)
avalanches, (n|(n − 1, n − 2)) = p + (1 − p)pa(2). If Gate-(n − 2) does not avalanche, Gate-(n − 3) is considered, and
so on. Hence, the average avalanche probability of Gate-n is

pn = pn−1[p + (1 − p)pa(1)]

+ (1 − pn−1){pn−2[p + (1 − p)pa(2)] + (1 − pn−2)

{· · · {p0[p + (1 − p)pa(n)] + (1 − p0)p } · · · }}

.

(3)

(n−1)”}”

| {z }

The ﬁrst term of the equation means if the pre-gate avalanches, the ones before the pre-one are not considered. If the
pre-gate does not avalanche, the gate before the pre-gate is under considered, and so on. If AP pa(j) is small, and
only the ﬁrst order terms are reserved, namely, pa(i)pa(j) ∼= 0, then the approximate equation becomes

pn ∼= p[1 +

n

Xj=1

(1 − p)jpa(j)].

See appendix for detailed proof of Equation 4.

B. Non-Markov Model

Then, we assume that the system has memory of prior avalanching history and AP distribution is determined
by the avalanching history. Thus, the derivation of avalanche probability of Gate-n is much diﬀerent from that
of Markov-like Model and the full-expression depending on the avalanching history is very complex. For example,
p1 = p[p + (1 − p)pa(1)] + (1 − p)p = p[1 + (1 − p)pa(1)], p2 = p[p + (1 − p)pa(1)]{p + (1 − p)[pa(1) + pa(2)]} + p{1 − [p +
(1 − p)pa(1)]}[p + (1 − p)pa(2)] + (1 − p)p1. Here we give a formal expression of pn, and then give the approximate
equation of pn. pn can be classiﬁed into two sets: Gate-0 avalanches in the ﬁrst set F (p, pa(j)) and does not avalanche
in the second set S(p, pa(j)). The second set can be expressed as S(p, pa(j)) = (1 − p)pn−1. Then pn can be expressed
as

By adopting the same approximation utilized in the Markov model, where pa(i)pa(j) ∼= 0, then we obtain the

approximate equation of Equation 5,

pn = F (p, pa(j)) + S(p, pa(j))

(5)

pn ∼= p[1 +

n

Xj=1

(1 − p)pa(j)].

(6)

See appendix for detailed proof of Equation 6. In fact, the formal expression is enough for the proof.

Comparing Equation 6 with Equation 4, we ﬁnd that, for both cases, pn depends on two parameters. The ﬁrst one
is p, the photon-ignition avalanche probability without afterpulsing. The second one is the AP distribution pa(j).
The afterpulsing inﬂuence increases via n, but the weight of pa(j) decays exponentially. The decay rate depends on
the base (1 − p). In fact, the afterpulsing inﬂuence becomes saturation when n is large enough. It is reasonable to
truncate n to an appropriate value according to the actual value of p. The equation will degenerate into pn = p if
no afterpulsing exists. However, the inﬂuence of afterpulsing of non-Markov model is more signiﬁcant. The weight
of pa(j) in non-Markov case is (1 − p), which is linear. But the corresponding weight of pa(j) in Markov-like case is
(1 − p)j, which decays exponentially. Thus, the Markovian approximation holds only for p, pa(j) ≪ 1. The diﬀerence
between these two model will become more and more signiﬁcant as p or pa(j) (or both of them) increases. The
experiments demonstrated below prove that afterpulsing eﬀect is non-Markov.

III. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION

The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. The laser diode (LD) is operated in pulsed mode and is triggered by
a modulating signal. Figure 1(b) shows the modulating signal, which includes M trigger pulses for every interval ∆T .
The trigger frequency f and interval time ∆T are adjustable. The SPAD (The model of APD is: Princeton Lightwave
PGA-300) is operated in gated mode without dead time and the gate width is 2.5 ns. The detection eﬃciency η of
the SPAD is about 10.5%. The detection gate is triggered by external pulsed signal, as shown in Figure 1(c). All
trigger signals are synchronized. Laser pulses from the LD are attenuated by a adjustable attenuator and then sent
into the SPAD. The SPAD outputs a detection signal if an avalanche happens. The detection signals are input into a
time-to-digital converter (TDC, Agilent U1051A Acqiris TC890) in real time. The TDC can records the arriving time
of every detection signal with a resolution of 50 ps. The parameter p can be modulated by adjusting the attenuator.
The parameter pa(j) is modulated by changing the trigger frequency f .

The veriﬁcation work consists of three experiments. In the ﬁrst experiment, the AP distributions under diﬀerent
trigger frequencies (f = 2, 5, 10 and 20 MHz) are measured with single (M = 1) and multi-ignition laser pulses
(M > 100). The average photon number λ per pulse is set as 0.07. The AP pa(j) is the avalanche probability of
Gate-(M + j − 1) after subtracting the dark count. In the second experiment, the average photon number λ is

modulated (λ = 1.0, 0.7, 0.07 and 0.02) so that the avalanche probability pn with diﬀerent p can be measured, while
the AP distribution pa(j) varies little. In the third experiment, the afterpulsing distribution pa(j) is modulated.
The trigger frequency f is modulated (f = 2, 5, 10 and 20 MHz) so that the AP distribution pa(j) becomes diﬀerent,
while λ is set as constant (λ = 0.07). For all experiments, the dark count rate per gate is under the order of 10−5.

The ﬁrst experiment demonstrates that AP increases as f increases (see Figure 2), where λ = 0.07. As shown in
Figure 2(a), pa = 2.0% when f = 2 MHz, while pa = 29.9% when f = 20 MHz, where pa(j) is the AP of Gate-j and
pa is the total AP with single-ignition pulse. It also demonstrates that APs with multi-ignition pulses (Figure 2(b))
are much larger than that with single ignition pulse (Figure 2(a)). For example, when f = 5 MHz, pa,100(1) = 6.1%,

while pa(1) = 0.9% and pa ≈

pa(j) = 6.2%, where pa,M (j) is the AP of Gate-(M + j − 1) with M -ignition

M=100

Pj=1

pulses. Thus, pa,100(1) ≈ pa. It means that AP accumulates as M increases. Namely, AP depends on the avalanching
history and is non-Markovian. The AP becomes larger as f increases. As the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
the detection signal output from the SPAD is about 40 ns, the saturated processing rate of the discrimination circuit
is less than 20 MHz by taking the processing time into account. Thus, pa(1) drops and is even smaller than expected
when f = 20 MHz. However, the processing rate limitation is not that signiﬁcant for the experiments because the
average photon number λ = 0.07, which is small, when f = 20 MHz.

The second experiment (see Figure 3) shows that the diﬀerence between non-Markov model and Markov model is
negligible when λ = 0.02 (p = 1 − e−ηλ ≈ 0.002). The diﬀerence is signiﬁcant when p is larger, e. g., Figure 3(d)
shows that pnon−Markov
= 1.053 · p − 1.027 · p = 0.026 × p. The Markov model can no longer ﬁt with the
experimental data.

− pMarkov

n=99

n=99

The third experiment gives the diﬀerences between non-Markov model and Markov model with diﬀerent pa(j) (see
Figure 4). There is hardly any diﬀerence between these two model when f = 2 MHz (pa = 2.0%), as shown in Figure
4(a). But the diﬀerence becomes pnon−Markov

≈ 0.1 · p for large n when f = 20 MHz (pa = 29.9%).

− pMarkov

The experimental results above are all consistent well with the non-Markov model. According to the Equation 6, the
afterpulsing inﬂuence on photon detection depends on the product of p, the pulse-ignition avalanche probability per
detection window, and pa, the total AP. In Figures 3(a), p · pa = 1.3 × 10−4. And in Figure 4(a), p · pa = 1.4 × 10−4. In
both ﬁgures, the Markov model also ﬁts well with the experimental data. But in Figures 3(b),(c),(d) and 4(b),(c),(d),

FIG. 4: (Color online) The experimental data and theoretical simulations for pn with diﬀerent gate frequency f . The average
photon number per laser pulse is λ = 0.07. The detection eﬃciencies are ηf =2M Hz = 10.3%, ηf =5M Hz = 10.5%, ηf =10M Hz =
11.6%, ηf =20M Hz = 12.0%. The insets are the partial enlargements. The error bar is set as 3σ, where σ is the standard deviation
of statistics.

Markov model can no longer ﬁt with the data, where p · pa is 5.3 × 10−3 in Figures 3(d) and is 2.1 × 10−3 in Figures
4(d). The non-Markov eﬀect will be more signiﬁcant for higher pa. It is really the case for high-count-rate SPADs, of
which the detection period is much smaller than the lifetime of carriers [6–8].

It should be note that detection eﬃciency of the SPAD varies when trigger frequency f varies. In order to make
comparing of AP inﬂuence with diﬀerent f , the gate voltage loaded on SPAD is ﬁne adjusted so that detection eﬃciency
varies less (ηf =2M Hz = 10.3%, ηf =5M Hz = 10.5%, ηf =10M Hz = 11.6%, ηf =20M Hz = 12.0%). Otherwise, afterpulsing would
be a catastrophe and the SPAD under f = 20 MHz could no longer work properly if the voltage remains the same
with that under f = 2 MHz.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have proved that afterpulsing eﬀect of SPAD has memory on avalanching history and is non-
Markov. We give an approximate expression (Equation 6) that describes the non-Markov eﬀect well. The theoretical
analysis ﬁts well with the experimental results. The non-Markov eﬀect will be more signiﬁcant for higher pa. It is
really the case for high-count-rate SPADs, of which the detection period is much smaller than the lifetime of carriers
[6–8]. As it is the embodiment of rarely ﬁlling of traps, the non-Markov eﬀect of afterpulsing should be general
to diﬀerent types of SPADs provided that the ﬁlling is rare during an avalanching process. Our work makes the
principle of afterpulsing eﬀect clearer and is instructive to the manufacturing processes and afterpulsing evaluation
of high-count-rate SPADs. It also oﬀers a new perspective to deal with practical security of quantum communication

due to the imperfection of devices.

[29] A process satisﬁes the Markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present
state, i. e., conditional on the present state of the system, its future and past are independent. Otherwise, if its future and
past are correlated, the process is non-Markov. As shown in this letter, the afterpulsing probability distribution depends
on the avalanching history. Thus afterpulsing eﬀect satisﬁes non-Markov property.

1. The Markovian approximate equation

The complete equation of avalanche probability per gate in Markov model is

pn = pn−1[p+(1−p)pa(1)]+(1−pn−1){pn−2[p+(1−p)pa(2)]+(1−pn−2){· · · {p0[p+(1−p)pa(n)]+(1−p0)p } · · · }}

By keeping the ﬁrst-order terms of pa(j) only, we obtain the approximate equation

(2)

Proof. First, we consider the limiting case of no afterpulsing. In this case, pn = p always holds.

Thus, in general, pn can be expressed as pn = p+ gn(pa(j)), where gn(pa(j)) = gn(pa(1), pa(2), pa(3), · · · ) is a power

series of pa(j) and j = 1, 2, · · · . For the ﬁrst term of right side, we have

pn−1[p + (1 − p)pa(1)] = [p + gn−1(pa(j))] · [p + (1 − p)pa(1)]

= p2 + p(1 − p)pa(1) + pgn−1(pa(j)) + gn−1(pa(j)) · (1 − p)pa(1)
∼= p2 + p(1 − p)pa(1) + pgn−1(pa(j)).

The remainder terms become

(1 − pn−1){pn−2[p + (1 − p)pa(2)] + (1 − pn−2){· · · {p0[p + (1 − p)pa(n)] + (1 − p0)p } · · · }}

=[1 − p − gn(pa(j))]{pn−2[p + (1 − p)pa(2)] + (1 − pn−2){· · · {p0[p + (1 − p)pa(n)] + (1 − p0)p } · · · }}

, we begin

with the innermost brace. The term containing pa(n) can be abandoned directly by the approximation convention
pa(i)pa(j) ∼= 0. Then, the expression of the innermost brace is simpliﬁed to p. Then, the expression outside the
innermost brace becomes p1[p + (1 − p)pa(n − 1)] + (1 − p1)p ∼= p. The expressions of outer braces can be simpliﬁed by

Analogously, pn−2, pn−3, · · · can be simpliﬁed by the same procedure done for pn−1. Equation 1 ﬁnally becomes

(1 − p)jpa(j)].

This completes the proof.

Pj=1

There is an alternative proof of the Markovian approximate equation. The proof is shown below.

Proof. The recurrence relation of the sequence pn can be written as follows according to Equation 1:

pn+1 = p + pn(1 − p)pa(1) + pn−1(1 − pn)(1 − p)pa(2) + · · · + p(1 − p1) · · · (1 − pn)(1 − p)pa(n + 1)

According to Equation 3, it is easy to get that p1 = p + p(1 − p)pa(1), p2 = p + p1(1 − p)pa(1) + p(1 − p1)(1 −
p)pa(2) ∼= p[1 + (1 − p)pa(1) + (1 − p)2pa(2)], where we only keep the ﬁrst-order terms of pa(j). Thus, we assume that
pn ∼= p[1 +

(1 − p)jpa(j)]. If pn+1 = pn + p(1 − p)n+1pa(n + 1) holds, then Equation 2 holds.

n

According to Equation the expression of pn, we can replace all the pn in Equation 3 by p since we neglect higher

than the ﬁrst-order terms of pa(j). Thus we can get straightforwardly:

pn+1 ∼= p + p(1 − p)pa(1) + p(1 − p)2pa(2) + · · · + p(1 − p)n+1pa(n + 1) = p[1 +

This means Equation 2 holds for n + 1, thus completes the proof.

2. The non-Markov approximate equation

The formal expression of avalanche probability per gate in non-Markov model is

pn = F (p, pa(j)) + S(p, pa(j))

By keeping the ﬁrst-order terms of pa(j) only, we obtain the approximate equation of non-Markov model

pn ∼= p[1 +

Xj=1

(1 − p)(pa(j))].

(6)

Proof. According to Equation 5, it is easy to get that p1 = p[1 + (1 − p)pa(1)], p2 = p[1 + (1 − p)(pa(1) + pa(2)) +
(1 − p)2pa(1)2] ∼= p[1 + (1 − p)(pa(1) + pa(2))], and p3 = p[1 + (1 − p)(pa(1) + pa(2) + pa(3)) + (1 − p)2pa(1)2 + 2(1 −
p)2pa(1)pa(2) + (1 − p)3pa(1)3] ∼= p[1 + (1 − p)(pa(1) + pa(2) + pa(3))]. Thus, we assume that pn−1 = p[1 + (1 −
p)(pa(1) + pa(2)) + · · · + pa(n − 1)]. If pn = pn−1 + p(1 − p)pa(n) holds, then Equation 6 holds.

The right side of Equation 5 includes two sets: Gate-0 avalanches in the ﬁrst set F (p, pa(j)) and does not avalanche
in the second set S(p, pa(j)).The second set can be expressed as S(p, pa(j)) = (1 − p)pn−1. The main diﬀerence
of the ﬁrst set from the second set is the afterpulsing eﬀect ignited by Gate-0.
If we separate out all terms due
to the afterpulsing eﬀect of Gate-0 (that is, terms with factors pa(1) of Gate-1, pa(2) of Gate-2, · · · , pa(n) of
Gate-n), the remaining terms of the ﬁrst set can be expressed as p · pn−1. Terms with factor pa(1) of Gate-1 are
(p, pa(j)) are the abbreviations for the
p(1 − p)pa(1)f1(p, pa(j)) − p(1 − p)f1
remaining factors. According to the approximate convention, all terms with pa(j) in f1(p, pa(j)) and f1
(p, pa(j)) are
abandoned. Then f1(p, pa(j)) and f1

(p, pa(j)) approximate to the same expression

(p, pa(j)), where f1(p, pa(j)) and f1

k (cid:1) is the binomial coeﬃcient. Hence, p(1 − p)pa(1)f1(p, pa(j)) − p(1 − p)f1

where (cid:0)n−1
(p, pa(j)) ∼= 0. Analogously,
Terms with factor pa(2) of Gate-2, pa(3) of Gate-3, · · · , pa(n − 1) of Gate-(n − 1) all approximate to 0. As there is
no term −(1 − p)pa(n) for Gate-n, there remains one nonzero term p(1 − p)pa(n)fn(p, pa(j)) ∼= p(1 − p)pa(n), where
fn(p, pa(j)) ∼= 1 by the approximation convention. Thus,

pn = F (p, pa(j) + S(p, pa(j)) = p · pn−1 + p(1 − p)pa(n) + (1 − p)pn−1 = pn−1 + p(1 − p)pa(n)

This completes the proof.
