Clearly, A(α)
(a; z) is a kind of entire function treated in Lemma 14.1.4 of [11], and
by the lemma it must have inﬁnitely many zeros if aqn 6= 1 for any nonnegative
integers n ∈ N0. Furthermore, in [8] Hayman proved an asymptotic expansion for
the n-th zero of this class of entire function under the general condition that the
parameter q is strictly inside the unit disk |q| < 1.

zeros. Thus it is natural to ask under what conditions the zeros of the entire
function A(α)
(a; z) are all real. In this work we shall present a partially answer to
this question and more.

2. Preliminaries

In the proofs we need the Vitali’s theorem [15] and Hurwitz’s theorem [2]. For

our convenience we list them here. The ﬁrst is the Vitali’s theorem:
Theorem 1. Let {fn(z)} be a sequence of functions analytic in a domain D and
assume that fn(z) → f (z) point-wise in D. Then fn(z) → f (z) uniformly in any
subdomain bounded by a contour C, provided that C is contained in D.

Here is the Hurwitz’s theorm:

Theorem 2. If the functions fn(z) are analytic and 6= 0 in a region Ω, and if
fn(z) converges to f (z), uniformly on every compact subset of Ω, then f (z) is
either identically zero or never equal to zero in Ω.

It is known that if an entire function has a ﬁnite order that it is not a positive
integer, then f (z) has inﬁnitely many zeros, [4, 11]. Given an entire function of
order 0 with f (0) 6= 0, if −zk, k ∈ N are all the roots, then by Hadamard’s canonical
representation of entire functions we have

where c, β, zk ∈ R, α ≥ 0, m ∈ Z+, and
k < ∞. Clearly, given a real
entire function f (z) of order 0 that has nonnegative Taylor coeﬃcients and satisﬁes
f (0) 6= 0, if it is also in the Laguerre-Pólya class then it must have the factorization
(2.1) with zk > 0.
n=0 is called a Pólya frequence (PF) sequence if the inﬁnite
i,j=0 is totally positive, i.e. all its minors are nonnegative, where we

In the case bk = 0 for k = n + 1, . . . , then the right hand series becomes a

polynomial of degree at most n, then we have the following, [3, 7, 10, 14]

(1) Let bk ≥ 0, k ≥ 0. Then, the sequence {bk}n

k=0 is a PF sequence if and

only if the polynomial

(−a; z) has no zeros outside the set (−∞, 0). Since by Lemma

(−a; z) has inﬁnitely many zeros, then we have
proved that A(α)

(−a; z) has inﬁnitely many zeros and all of them are negative.

then by the Stirling’s formula [1],

we have

log Γ(x + 1) = x log x + O(x),

x → ∞,

− log ak = (m + 2ℓ)k log k + O(k)

as k → ∞. Thus the order of g(z) is given by [4]

the claim on (3.6) is proved.

has inﬁnitely many zeros.
