The resonant-cavity-enhanced (RCE) technique is an important approach to increasing the detection efﬁciency
(DE) of typical free-space coupling photons. Here, we show that such a technique can also be utilized to increase
the detection probability (DP) of a single waveguide-coupled photon. Based on a fully quantum mechanical
theory in real space, we exactly calculated the absorption probability of a single photon for a two-level detector
next to the waveguide. We ﬁnd that the DP of the waveguide photon for the detector in a waveguide-coupled
ring cavity is signiﬁcantly higher than that for the bare detector directly coupled to the photon. Physically, the
DP of the photon for the bare detector next to the waveguide is always limited by the ﬁnite transmission and
reﬂection probabilities of the photon. The cavity technique is used to store the photon and thus increase its DP.
The feasibility of the proposal with current integrated optical devices is then discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Single-photon detection is a well-studied but nonetheless
hot topic in optical physics because it is related to various im-
portant applications, speciﬁcally the realizations of the optical
quantum computation[1, 2], quantum information[3] and pre-
cise measurements [4]. Photon detections have been achieved
by utilizing photomultiplier tubes (PMT), wherein the absorp-
tions of the incident photons were converted into detectable
electronic signals. In semiconducting detectors, speciﬁcally
single-photon avalanche photon diodes (SAPD) [5], the sig-
nals related to photon-induced electron-hole pairs are probed.
To decrease unwanted dark counts, low temperature detectors
with quantum dots [6] and superconductors [7, 8] have also
been developed.

waveguide; (a) a bare two-level atom as a single-photon detector
and (b) a two-level atom in a microring cavity as a single-photon
detector. Here, the single-mode waveguide is denoted by the green
channel, and the microring cavity is denoted by a blue circle. The
two-level atomic detector is denoted by a red dot.

Recently, to decrease the loss of photons and achieve con-
venient optical device integrations on a chip, integrated pho-
tonic circuits [9, 10] have been paid substantial attention. In
the waveguide, the photons are effectively conﬁned in cer-
tain micro-structures and thus the relevant propagation losses
can be minimized. Therefore, by integrating the waveguide
and photonic devices simultaneously on a chip [11], the ef-
ﬁciencies of the photonic emission, traveling, routing, detec-
tion, etc. can be signiﬁcantly increased. Although the trans-

port properties of single photons traveling along waveguide
structures have been extensively investigated; see, e.g., [12–
14], the research on the detection of the waveguide photons
with integrated photon detectors is relatively sparse [17–24].
Typically, superconducting nanowire single photon detectors
(SNSPDs) [17–22]and transition edge sensors (TESs) [23, 24]
have been demonstrated for the waveguide-coupled photon
detections. Note that the 20% DE (at telecommunication
wavelengths) [17, 18, 20]) of a single photon for GaAs
SNSPD integrated waveguide-coupled detectors [25] has been
experimentally demonstrated, which is substantially higher
than those for the free-space coupling counterparts (usually
∼ 10% [26]). A higher DE could be achieved by further op-
timizing integrated waveguide-coupled detectors via further
decreasing the coupling losses.

Given that the resonant cavity enhanced (RCE) technique
has been extensively utilized to increase the DE of the usual
free-space coupling photon detectors [27], it is expected that
such a technique will also useful for waveguide-coupled pho-
ton detectors. The applied RCE devices can store the detected
photons in the cavity, and thus, the relevant DE can be in-
creased. Various resonant cavity geometries, including the
Fabry-Perot resonant cavity [27] and microring resonant cav-
ity [28], have been successfully applied to increase the DEs of
free-space-coupled photon detectors, i.e., the photons propa-
gate in free space until being absorbed by the detectors.

In this paper, we ﬁrst calculate the DP of the single pho-
ton conﬁned in the waveguide by a bare two-level atom. It
is shown that such a probability is quite low as a relatively
low probability of the photon-induced atomic excitation. To
enhance the probability of atom excitation, we propose an ap-
proach by using the RCE technique, i.e., a resonant microring
cavity structure [14, 29, 30](see also Fig. 1(b)), to transport
the traveling photon along the waveguide into the cavity. Our
discussion is based on a full quantum theory [12–14] for sin-
gle photons transporting in real space and interacting with a
two level detector in the resonant cavity. The detection of the
single photon is implemented by probing the excitation prob-
ability of the two-level atomic detector coupled to the waveg-
uide. Because the traveling waveguide photon is converted
into a standing wave that is stored in the cavity, the DP of the

single photon can be increased. The feasibility of the proposal
is also discussed.

II. DP OF A SINGLE PHOTON IN A WAVEGUIDE BY A

BARE TWO-LEVEL ATOMIC DETECTOR

Following Ref. [13, 14, 16], the effective Hamiltonian de-
scribing a single photon propagating along a one-dimensional
waveguide scattered by a single two-level atom can be ex-
pressed as

erator of the atom, vg is the group velocity of the incident pho-
ton in the waveguide, γq is the dissipation rate of the excited
atom, and h (with units of √m MHz to ensure consistent di-
mensions, more details can be seen in the Ref ( [16]) is the
efﬁcient coupling strength between the atom and the waveg-
uide photon. Obviously, the ﬁrst and second parts in the above
Hamiltonian describe the photon freely transporting along the
waveguide and the bare atom, respectively. The third part de-
scribes the interaction between the atom and the photon in the
waveguide.

The generic quantum state of the system can be expressed

as

φL(x) = re−ikxθ(−x), with t and r being the transmission
and reﬂection amplitudes of the photon, respectively. Conse-
quently, Eq. (5) can be further simpliﬁed as

Fig. 2 shows how the excitation probability ηb (i.e., the DP
of the conﬁned photon by a bare two-level detector) varies
with the dissipation γq of the excited atomic state and the
photon-detector resonant coupling strength h. For a deﬁned
atomic dissipation rate γq, the value of ηb is found to ex-
hibit a maximal value when varying the photon-detector in-
teracting strength. In addition, the peak value of ηb increases
monotonously with decreasing atomic dissipation. The de-
sired photon detection is usually achieved by probing the leak-
age of the population from the excited atomic state. This

FIG. 3: DP of the single conﬁned photon in the waveguide by the

implies that the dissipation of the detector atom should be
sufﬁciently large; otherwise, its leakage cannot be measured.
Moreover, when γq ∼ 0, the resonant photon is fully reﬂected
by the atomic detector, i.e., |r|2 ∼ 1 and |t|2 ∼ 0, even though
the atom can still be temporally excited. In this case, the pho-
ton cannot be detected by the detector.

For a typical dissipation of the atomic detector, e.g.,
γq/2π = 0.16 MHz [30], Fig. 3 shows the DP of the single
conﬁned photon in the waveguide versus the effective atom-
photon detuning ∆ ≡ ω − Ω and the effective atom-photon
coupling strength Γ1 = |h|2/vg. It is seen that, for the ﬁxed
dissipation γq/2π = 0.16 MHz of the atomic detector, the
DP of the photon exhibits a maximal value for certain param-
eters and varies symmetrically with the frequency of the in-
cident light. For a deﬁned Γ1, the DP of the resonant photon
is always higher than that of the off-resonant photon. Fur-
thermore, for a deﬁned atom-photon detuning, the DP of the
photon exhibits a peak value, corresponding to an optimal ef-
fective atom-photon coupling. The maximum DP of the res-
onant photon by the present bare detector is approximately
ηb = 33.22%. This is low for desired quantum information
processing on chip and should be increased.

Here, a† and b† are the Bosonic operators describing the anti-
clockwise and clockwise WGMs in the microring cavity with
the same frequency ωc and dissipation rate γc, respectively.
The sixth and seventh terms in the Hamiltonian (9) are the in-
teractions between the waveguide-cavity modes, and Va/b and
ga/b describe the coupling strength between the a/b mode and
the photon in the waveguide and the atom detector, respec-
tively. Note that the efﬁcient coupling strength V has the same
dimensions as h, and the unit of g is that of the frequency. The
generic wave function of the present system takes the form

(8)
where |0, 0,−i represents the ground state of the system (i.e.,
there is no propagating photon in the waveguide, and the cav-
ity and the atom are not excited). With the same approach
used in Sec. II, for a single photon input along the waveg-
uide from the left direction, the excitation probabilities of the
atomic detector and the WG modes as well as the reﬂection
and transmission amplitude of the incident photon are deter-
mined as follows:

It is well known that the microcavity technique has ma-
tured in recent decades. The RCE devices beneﬁt from the
wavelength selectivity and increased optics-matter interac-
tions. As a consequence, RCE photodetectors can be thinner
and smaller, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the photon
response and thus the quantum efﬁciency of the photon de-
tection. With such a technique, light with off-resonant wave-
lengths is rejected. In this section, we show that such a tech-
nique can also be utilized to increase the excitation probability
of a single two-level atomic detector for waveguide photons.
The basic idea of the RCE technique is to convert a pho-

coupling strength g (between the atom and the cavity) should
c )γq/√2γc ≈ 1.82 MHz, and
be designed as g = p(Γ2
thus, g/2π ≈ 0.29 MHz. Physically, the matching conditions
demonstrated above imply that the photon in the waveguide
is maximally (with 82% probability) converted in the cavity.
Thus, the DP of the photon for the atom detector in the cavity
is maximal.

V ∗, ga = gb = g = g∗ and vg = 1 for simplicity. Conse-
quently, the normalized DP of the photon in the waveguide by
the atom detector in the cavity reads

ηc =

|t|2 + |r|2 + |eq|2 + |ea|2 + |eb|2 .

(11)

For the optimized atom-cavity coupling strength g/2π =
0.29MHz, Fig. 4 shows how the DP of the resonant photon
depends on the coupling strength V (between the photon in
the waveguide and the cavity) and h (between the atom and the
photon in the waveguide) for typical dissipation rates for the
atom and cavity [30]: γq/2π = 0.16 MHz and γc/2π = 0.76
MHz. Speciﬁcally, one can observe the following:

i) For a ﬁxed coupling strength h, the DP obtains a peak
value for certain selected values of V . However, for V /2π ≥
0.6 √m MHz, the DP monotonously decreases.
ii) When V ∼ 0, the photon can still be directly detected by
the atom detector, although the probability is relatively low,
e.g., the maximal value is ηc ∼ 0.2.
iii) Interestingly, there exists a cavity-enhanced (h, V )-
regime (i.e., the yellow regime with ηc ≥ 0.34), wherein the
DP of the photon in the waveguide is signiﬁcantly increased
compared to that for the bare atom detector.

FIG. 5: DP ηc of the photon for a two-level atom detector in a
microring cavity versus the coupling strength V (between the photon
in the waveguide and the cavity) and g (between the atom and cavity).
The parameters are γq/2π = 0.16 MHz, γc/2π = 0.76 MHz, and
h = 0.

This can be veriﬁed further using the numerical results
shown in Fig. 5, which shows how the parameters g and V
inﬂuence the DP of the photon. Here, the interaction between
the atom and the photon in the waveguide is negligible due to
the screen of the cavity. Note that at the maximal DP point,
the reﬂection probability |r|2 of the photon in the waveguide
remains non-zero (although |t|2 ∼ 0) due to the existence of
the atom detector in the cavity.
Fig. 6 shows that at the maximal DP point (with the op-
timized atom-cavity coupling strength g = 1.82 MHz), the
reﬂection probability of the photon is |r|2 ≈ 18.00%; the ex-
citation probability of the a- and b modes in the cavity are
|ea|2 ≈ 26.81% and |eb|2 ≃ 1.65%, respectively.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we propose an approach based on a full quan-
tum mechanic theory in real space to increase the DP of a
single photon transporting along a one-dimensional waveg-
uide. For a bare detector, we found that the DP is related to
the dissipation rate of the atom and the atom-photon coupling
strength. Typically, for a deﬁnite atomic dissipation, e.g.,

FIG. 4: DP ηc of the photon for a two-level atomic detector in a
microring cavity versus the coupling strength V (between the photon
in the waveguide and the cavity) and h (between the atom and the
photon in the waveguide). The other parameters are γq/2π = 0.16
MHz, γc/2π = 0.76 MHz [30], and g/2π = 0.29 MHz when we
properly varied to achieve the maximum DP.

We now analyze the maximum value of ηc, which is
found (in Fig. 4) to be ηc = 54.39% for h/2π = 0 and
V /2π = 0.61√m MHz. This corresponds to the very weak
atom-waveguide coupling, i.e., h ∼ 0, and the phase- and
magnitude-matching conditions

FIG. 6: DP and transport parameters of the photon in the waveguide,
e.g., the detection, reﬂection and transmission probabilities etc. ver-
sus the coupling strength V . Here, the dissipation rates of the cavity
and atom are set to γq/2π = 0.16 MHz and γc/2π = 0.76 MHz,
and the coupling strength of the atom and the photon in the waveg-
uide is h = 0.

γq = 0.16 MHz, the maximum DP of the resonant photon
in the waveguide for the bare detector is 33.22%. However,
if the atom detector is placed adjacent to a microring cavity,
then the traveling photon can be transported into the cavity
and stored as standing wave modes. This increases the DP
of the photon. Indeed, our analytical and numerical results
show that the DP of the photon in a waveguide for the detec-
tor in a cavity can be signiﬁcantly increased, and the maximal
value of this probability can reach 54.39%. This again sug-
gests that the RCE technique, used successfully to increase
the detection efﬁciency of the photons in free space, can also
be utilized to enhance the DP of a single photon in waveguide
structures. In principle, by integrating a series of cavity as the
reﬂectors [22] the ideal detection (i.e., its DP approaches to

5

100%) of the waveguide photons is feasible.

Hopefully, our proposal is feasible and can be directly ap-
plied to current integrated optoelectronics for optical quantum
information processing on chips. Integrating the waveguide
device and the photon detector on a chip is realizable with
current integrated photonic techniques [17, 18]; the quantum
efﬁciency of a waveguide nanowire superconducting single-
photon detector has been increased to 20% [20]. In addition,
in Ref. [31], a system consisting of quantum dots (artiﬁcial
atoms could be used as photon detectors) in a cylindrical glass
waveguide were fabricated. Furthermore, WGMs have been
observed in a GaN-based microdisks [32]. Therefore, with
current integrated optical techniques, the increased DP of the
photon in a waveguide proposed in this paper should be feasi-
ble.

It is worth emphasizing that the physical mechanism pre-
sented here to detect the waveguide photon is different from
those in the SSPDs [18]. Cooper pairs in superconductors are
the collective elementary excitations of electrons and are not
local. Photon detection by the SSPDs is implemented by prob-
ing the disappearance of these elementary excitations by am-
plifying the absorption effects of the photon. In the present
model, a single photon is detected by probing the induced ex-
citation of a single two-level atom. Therefore, in principle, the
previously demonstrated SSPDs should not be modeled sim-
ply as a single two-level detector. However, whether a series
of two-level detectors can be integrated to describe the SSPDs
remains an open question and requires further investigation.
